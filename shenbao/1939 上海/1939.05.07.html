<p>社評</p>
<h3>重慶的浩劫</h3>
<p>五月三四兩日，日本飛機大規模轟炸重慶之後，殺傷平民之多，造成了八一三以來的新紀錄。據傳重慶最熱鬧的市街化爲焦土，中國平民和一部分外僑死傷的總數竟達五千左右。日機對中國各地的在肆轟炸，原也是司空見慣的事，並且每當一决日軍失利的時候，他們總加緊着空中的暴行，向中國各不設防的城市恣意濫炸。而這决的轟炸重慶以及寗波福州等地，反證了最近一月間，日軍在南北各戰場的普遍地失利，這眞是一種戰略麽？這是洩憤，這是遮羞！</p>
<p>我們對於過去各地中國人民慘遭日機轟炸，因而死傷，因而骨肉離散，因而財物蕩析的，都表示無限的悼念；允其這回重慶的市民和外僑，大量遭受犧牲，更使世界上每一個有理智的人都深切地感到愴痛。國際對此現象，無論爲正義，爲人道，終不應熟視若無覩，然而書面抗議，口頭譴責，決不能使她修正「計劃的暴行」。所以現在除災禍的善後如救傷，賑濟等事，必須大家努力參加外，根本上還得講求有效的方法來制裁暴行，制裁暴行，不是枝枝節節的事，應求澈底解決，這在每一個中國人當然知道如何盡他抗戰時期的國民責任，而每一個同情中國的人，至少爲不能坐視暴行起見，應該用實力帮助中國抗戰共同爭取最後的勝利；我們深信中國勝利之日，纔是日本暴行結束之時。</p>
<p>空口詛咒暴行是無效的。暴行者終必自食其報。試看中國各地，一方面確爲空襲而遭受了損失，但同時也正在那裏增强抗戰力量，這句話決不是詭辯。原來日機肆虐，不分前方後方，到處對中國人民示威，恰也就因此到處扇起了抗戰火燄，激發了每一個中國人對敵方暴行的認識，可以說一决轟炸的效力，比了十决的戰場爭鬥，比了千决的國民敎育，還要宏大。同時，每一决日機的無情轟炸，屠殺了無辜平民，燬滅了文化機關，必然會引起世界人士廣大的注意和深切的關心，這也可以促成一種偉大的力量，可以推進世界各國對日本的厭惡和對中國的實力援助。這回重慶的轟炸，情形固然比以前任何一决來得慘重，但刺激中國人和世界同情中國者的力量，也比以前任何一决來得巨大。因爲這一决不但是量的空前，並且是質的嚴重。</p>
<p>何以謂質的嚴重？第一，從這回重慶轟炸目標全在鬧市的一點上，可知日軍有意以中國平民爲目標，這在客觀上必然會加强了一般人民的抗戰意識，但在日本的主觀，是以慘殺爲示威。重慶雖是中國抗戰時期的新都，但在事實上，一切軍政重耍機關早已疎散他處，日方對於這一點，豈有不知的道理？即使說目前的重慶還留着一部分機關，也値得轟炸；但日機此决轟炸目標事實上完全不在政府機關區域，却在重慶市內的商業區域和住宅區域。一决不足，繼以二决，以致平民傷亡纍纍，屍體橫陳，大火三旦未息，災區達兩公里以上，這不是有意屠殺平民是什麼？</p>
<p>第二，從這回重慶轟炸炸毀了各國使領館的一點上，可知日軍又有意向世界各國挑釁，原來重慶的各國使領館都在山項地方，旗號分明，地位淸楚，日機白晝轟炸，決不能諉稱視綫不明。然而日機竟對各使領館同様地轟炸，可知一定是事出有意。各國中間受害最重的是英國，大使寇爾恰在重慶，領館被燬，大使秘書泰賀定受有微傷，這決不是偶然的巧合，而簡直是日本有計劃的向英國挑釁，和淪陷區域內的日人所策動反英運動很有相連的關係。同時，與日本內閣不聽軍人的主張，不與德義締結普遍的軍事同盟，也有聯帶的關係。</p>
<p>日軍的暴行一時決不會戢止，重慶以及其他城市的被轟炸事件必然跟着日軍戰場的失利而繼續發生着，但中國的抗戰力量也必然曾反比例地加强起來，世界各國對中國的同情和援助，也必然會反比例地加深起來，其中的得失利害，惟有讓侵略者自己去體認！</p>
<h3>渝市被襲後　大火昨晨撲滅　全市房至毀三分之一　人民傷亡數尙無統計</h3>
<p>英使館被波及已向日抗議</p>

<h3>保障東地中海安全　英土成立協定　三強軍事同盟建議　英復蘇聯勢難贊同</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社巴黎電　蘇聯人民外交委員長李維諾夫雖已去職、該國外交政策並不因而變更、英蘇兩國將以英國最後建議爲基礎、賡續進行談判、此間蘇聯人士則謂、日本因恐英國或在遠東方面向蘇聯接受某種的束、亟欲加以防止、爰乃聲明英國若在遠東方面不予蘇聯以援助、則日本不將反共牽國際公的改爲軍事同盟條的、英國因與蘇聯簽訂協定之後、日本或以敵對態度、加諸西歐各民治國、亦即猶豫不決、然則英蘇談判所由遲遲無所成就、探本窮源、英國實尸其咎、至蘇聯人民外交副委員長波丹金土耳其之行、結果極爲圓滿、彼此兩國、業已完全成立協定、此外，關於英土兩國所進行之談判、此間外交界人士均謂、此項談判業已成功、土國已允參加集體安全組織、即蘇聯亦已加以贊同、</p>
<p>土耳其史丹埠　此間消息靈通人士頃宜稱、英土兩國業巳成立協定、用以「保障地中海東部和平」、協定全文當於本月八日在英土兩國京城同時公佈、所有經過情形、均曾隨時通知蘇聯政府、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）英國與土耳其地中海東部和平協定告成之日、亦即蘇聯人民外交副委員長波丹金自土國京城返國之時、此間消息靈通人士因二事巧合如此特加以評論云、土耳其加入「大同盟」之舉、實爲蘇聯所贊同、可於此見之、土國當局之意、原不欲在英法蘇聯三國談話結束之前、完成對英談剁、茲乃改變方針、提前簽定協定、定係波丹金副委員長加以贊助所致、蘇聯之不欲推行孤立政策、亦可於此獲一明證、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）英國與土耳其國所商訂之協定頃已告成、法國政府並望其擴大爲英法土三國協商公的、但因叙利亞共和邦散嘉克區域隸屬問題之故、不無相當困難、緣土國當局要求逕將該區域劃歸該國、而以一九三八年法土兩國協定論之、則該區域應由法土兩國共同管理、雖然此問負責人士仍宣稱、此項問題當不難覓獲圓滿辦法、傳法土兩國咸皆滿　云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）咋晚英內閣外交委員會決議向蘇聯提出備忘錄、聲明英國在目前不能接受蘇方與法蘇訂立軍事同盟之建議、英外相哈里法克斯當即將此項備忘錄電致英駐蘇大使西慈、通知蘇聯外交部、據稱、英國之備忘錄中、曾開明目前英方不能接受蘇聯計劃之原因、故理論上並未堵塞英蘇締結軍事同盟之門戶、英政府今日等候蘇聯之覆文、甚爲急迫、蓋圖探知蘇方自李維諾夫撒職之後外交政策究竟有無變更也、據稱、英國致蘇備忘錄中會明言、英國假若與蘇聯立即締結直接之軍事同盟、或有影響英國與日本關係之處、同時或更將引起歐洲反共國家之反響、唯英方所提對案、規定蘇聯對於被侵略國援助、僅以英法已出兵之後爲限、藉免蘇聯受英法愚弄之弊、（六日美聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間外交界人士咸謂、英國政府之意、殆調李維諾夫之去職、並非蘇聯改變外交政策之謂、非然者即不致再度向蘇聯政府提出照會、此項照食內容如何、官場方面、並未有所透露、也據消息　通人士所知英國政府業已聲明波蘭　馬尼亞兩國均不願與蘇聯公開成立聯繫、以免德國認爲挑釁舉動、至英法蘇三國訂立三國同盟之議、則非英國政府所能贊同云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）哈里法克斯外相今晨延見蘇聯大使邁斯基、相與進行談話、據消息靈通人士所知、關於集體安全問題、英國所擬就之對案、尚未送達蘇聯政府、但當在短時間之內、寄交駐蘇聯大使西慈爵士、又據可靠消息、英土兩國協定、實際上已告成立、但政府非俟與其他各國允其是蘇聯政府談判完成時、不致正式予以宣佈、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間政界人士頃立稱、蘇聯前任外交人民委員長李維諾夫、曾經提議山英法蘇三國締結同盟條的、已爲英國政府所拒絕、蘇俄獨裁者史丹林是吾因而推行「孤立政策」、殊可注意、此間消息靈通人士則謂、英國政府在英法兩國出兵援助蘇聯各鄰邦時、雖望蘇聯出而相助、但不欲與之締結一般的相互的同盟條的、現仍堅持如故、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英外决白特勒昨以書面答覆某議員之問話、申稱、英國政府目前不擬與波羅的海各團即立陶宛拉特維亞。愛沙尼亞等締結互不侵犯公的、（六日海通電）</p>

<p>米蘭德義兩國外長午後開始談話，據一般人所知、談話主題厥爲波蘭問題、緣德波兩國他日發生衝突時、義國態度如何、德國亟欲知之、截至目下爲止、義國僅在半官機關各報發表文字、勸告波蘭當局務與德國進行談判而已、此在各觀察家則謂、波蘭問題與蘇台德問題迥不相同、良以義國與波蘭邦交素篤、義政府並認爲維持獨立自由之波蘭、實乃保持歐洲均勢之必要條件、不寗唯是、波蘭態度如何、足以影響羅馬尼亞南斯拉夫兩國之態度、此層自允爲義國所重視、此外外、問仍傳德義兩國外長擬就「羅馬柏林軸心」改爲軍事同盟條的之議、加以討論、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德積極進行　政治活動　拉攏小國以自重　對蘇聯暗送秋波　企圖粉碎英包圍政策</h3>
<p>（柏林）柏林昨夜集中注意之事物、並非柏克外長之演說、而是威廉街外交部之政治活動、外交部現正多方面進行歐洲政治活動、其反應足以粉碎英國之包圍政策」、德國整個外交政策幾全以英國爲對手、今已日見明顯、消息蓋通人士承認、德國外交政策爲推行此種目的、或將加以調整、關於德國與拉脫維亞愛沙尼亞磋商締結互不侵犯公的之外交成功、此間人士允畀予極大之意義、德國之歹不侵犯公的更將推及其他各國、蓋若干小國今亦明白與民主國家爲伍、乃入步戰爭之危險途中、關於外傳德國已與希臘開始締結互不侵犯公的談判之說、此間人士認爲毫無根據、蓋希臘乃地中海國家、與德國風馬牛不相及、且亦出於德國政治勢力範圍之外云、（六日海通電）</p>
<p>（柏林）此間消息靈通人士對外長里賓特洛甫前往義國、與外長齊亞諾進行談話一事、咸畀予重大意義、據悉、里賓特洛甫外長已於今晨十一時行抵米蘭、即將轉往柯摩湖西岸之賽諾比沃、準備明日在該處之愛斯台別墅、與齊亞諾外長進行談話、德義兩外長進行談話時、是吾將檢討軸心國家與蘇聯之關係問題、此問官傷人士拒不談論、有可注意者、乃「　堡外報曾發表評論、暗示李維諾夫去職後、軸心國家與蘇聯之思想衝突或可因而結束、西班牙之勝利、使布爾雪維克國家放棄與民主國家聯繫之念、時局之新轉變、誠爲德國人士所歡迎、從此德國之和平目的、可與民中國之和平目的成爲對照、該報繼結束其評論曰、今後蘇聯政策或將孤守自立、不然當與德國成立妥協云、（六日海通電）</p>

<h3>德會兩度誘波　聯合攻俄</h3>
<p>並瓜分其領域　但被波蘭拒絕</p>
<p>（巴黎）溫和派秩序報與急社黨事業報及右派斐伽羅報等均　稱、德元首希特勒曾於本年三月間向波蘭建議、合力進攻蘇聯、而瓜分其領域、事業報並載稱、蘇聯之烏克蘭邦與外高加案共和邦、擬劃歸德國、小俄羅斯共和邦與波羅的海沿岸地方則歸波蘭、斐伽羅報亦謂、德航空部長戈林上將前在波蘭國比亞洛維柴森林、與波國當局行臘時、即曾奉令提示此項建議（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華沙關於德元首希特勒兩决向波蘭提議聯合進攻蘇聯事、自巴黎某某報有所揭發之後、此間消息靈通人士頃加以證實云、第一决係在去歲二月間、德航空部長戈林上將來此聘問時、第二决係由德國外長里賓特洛浦於本年一月間向柏克外長所建議、前後兩决、德國均允在戰勝蘇聯之後、以烏克蘭邦向俄羅斯邦暨立陶宛一部份土地割歸波蘭、但爲柏克外長所拒絕、溯去年一月間戈林上將自此間返國之後、波蘭與立陶宛之爭即隨之而起、幸未演成武力衝突、雙方反已恢復邦交、而由敵國成爲友邦時至此日、且有締結同盟條的之議云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯未來政策　羅國尤所關心</h3>
<p>羅京　羅京人士稱、波蘭外長　克之言論堅決堂皇、未作抨擊語氣、故在德波兩國平等之基礎上、討論但澤與走廊問題之門戶並未關閉、惟蘇聯將來政策之問題、較諸柏克言論允關重要、今李維諾夫外長辭職之消息發表後已四十八小時、而蘇聯尚未作將來政策之聲明、此點殊有意義、衆信如史丹林意見、果與李維諾夫政策大旨相合、或欲在細則上稍改變李維諾夫之政策、則此時莫斯科當已有文告發表矣、（五日路透電）</p>

<p>糾察操縱</p>

<p>函陳經過</p>
<p>上海市豆米行業分會分函公共租界工部局·法租界公董局·暨上海市商會云、敬啟者，査敝會於本月五日邀集各米業團體舉行聯席會議、以近日滬市米價高漲、逾限甚遠、應如何處理案、議決僉以敝會原定限價爲最高白米每石不得超過十四元、中决照別、歷時已經一載、經各米業團體、極力維持、始終不渝煞費苦心、但近日因米糧來源、頗多障碍、如無錫每日運滬之米以五車爲限、計共六百二十五包、蘇州每月以四萬包爲限、常熟等處米價、均高逾滬地、南帮方面米船、又爲米市渡所攔阻、滬郊各處、反向滬地採購、至長江一帶、蕪湖米價旣漲、且又加稅、南京方面、不能運滬、來源旣稀、存貨漸减、以致價格高漲、逾限甚遠、　報告、最近高粳竟漲至十五元以上、若長此漫無限制、不加補救、影響民食甚鉅、本日各米業團體聯席會議、鄭重討論之　　為維持限、既為事實所不可能、且內地產價旣高、捐稅又重、販商頗多賠累、是亦不得不予以顧及、以冀來源之增加、（中略）　特錄案函達、至希察核備案、又該會定於明日下午二時、再派代表進謁兩租界當局　市商會等、詳陳變更米糧限價經過情形、並探詢當局之意見、</p>
<p>存米尙豐</p>
<p>關於本市各銀錢業棧房及行客等積存米糧、據評價委員會四次調查結果、尙存六十一萬餘包、但據關係方面談滬上存米總數、尙不止此數、其中落入私人非同業之手中、則無法調査確數、大的總在八十萬包以上、上以民食絕無恐慌之虞、又據記者控悉、現豆米行業公會市場管理會、除分函各產地同業各行儘量設法疏通來源外、並口頸勸告各帮販商、雖內地障碍重疊、但爲滬市民食前途計、增加販運、</p>
<p>平糶困難</p>
<p>本月五日米業各團體舉行聯席會議時、曾有米號業同業公會因鑒於米價飛漲、影響民食、特建議辦理平　以維一般平民之生計、擬於兩租界內各設平　處若干、每石規定最高價格、限制日銷數量、其平　虧耗、由上等米中抽捐補貼之、當該項建議於未舉行會議前、作私人交換意見結果、認為目前米糧價格高漲且平　之米糧、無充分巨額之準備以前、茲事體大、實現非常困難、故暫時作罷、將來至必要時、再行考慮、</p>

<h3>法捕房督察長　曹炳生昨遭暗殺　周身計中四彈均在要害　開刀後發炎於下午殞命</h3>
<p>當拘獲嫌欵犯流彈傷三人</p>
<p>昨晨法租界境內父發生血案一起、此血案之要角、爲法捕房政事部華書察長曹炳生、當時在途被暴徒數名開槍、曹身中三槍、延至下午四時三十分傷　逝世於廣慈醫院、茲探悉此案之經過詳情誌後、</p>
<p>由家外出中途遇險</p>
<p>此一血案之發生、爲昨晨七時五十分許、曹正由西愛成斯路拉都路一七二弄雙龍坊五號寓所乘坐包車、至捕房辦公、曹身服西裝、由其車夫常州人阿三拉車前進、不料行至離家的二十餘家門面距離之一六二號大福麵館門口之際、突由路旁躍出暴徒四名、均穿短衣、由其中二人上前握住車槓、不使前往、另二人在後拖住車篷、一面拔出手槍、向曹開放、</p>
<p>曹中四槍彈傷行人</p>
<p>曹獰不及備、致被擊中四槍、兩槍中左右乳之上部、未穿出、一彈則擦過右頸皮肉、頸後中一彈、經胸部而入肺臟、一時血流如注、受傷倒地、暴徒見狀、正擬圖逃、其中一人向甘世東路奔逃、適附近崗捕已聞得槍聲趕到、當由四三五號越捕首先向暴徒追捕、暴徒亦開槍拒捕、一時槍聲大作、雙方共發的二十餘槍、結果有天津靑年王庭生被彈繫傷、同時有女傭陳章氏·徐氏·等二人、被流彈擊傷</p>
<p>車送廣慈　醫院急救</p>
<p>當曹被擊倒於血泊中時、車夫阿三、亟返身飛逃返家報告曹妻孫氏、氏急奔赴出事地點、但以附近並無汽車行、乃攔得途過該處之汽車一輛、將曹送往廣慈醫院、同時法捕房亦得訊、立派救護車及大批中西探捕馳往救護及兜捕、當將流彈擊中之行人車送醫院、</p>
<p>彈入腹部輸血開刀</p>
<p>曹氏送入廣慈醫院後、即移入院內東部之樓上靠扶梯之一號優等病房內、法捕房重要人員及法總監法勃爾均親往探望、其親友等亦紛紛馳赴慰問、至十時十分、醫生因曹流血過多、乃由其家屬爲之輸血五百CC、時曹神智極淸、惟醫生因曹背部右肩上所中之彈、已由體內經過肺部、　入腹內、勢非開刀箝取子彈不可、當由家屬允准、至十一時零五分、將曹抬往手術問、先用愛克司光探照、十二時半正式開刀、經過尚稱良好、</p>
<p>不治逝世八日舉殯</p>
<p>詎開刀之後、約至二時左右、曹忽感氣衰力竭、呼吸困難、醫生亦因其彈傷肺腸、乃以養氣助其呼吸、詎終因體內發炎、傷勢劇變、延全下午四時卅分逝世、各界聞訊、均極震驚、現曹氏屍體巳車送上海殯儀館、並組治喪處、定於八日下午一時大殮、二時出殯、昨夜捕房方面、亦因曹氏被殺、案情重大、故澈底研究該案、並訓令各探捕注意偵緝兇手、務獲解案、</p>
<p>追獲兇手　流彈傷人</p>
<p>當越捕等於開槍追捕兇手之際、因流彈紛飛之故、有路人天津靑年王庭生與一買菜女傭陳張氏·徐氏、均被擊傷、由捕房送往醫治、傷勢均無大碍、而越捕與兇手雙方格鬥之際、有兇手同黨王少坤（年十九歲山東人住東新橋寬裕里二十二號）一名、被擊中數槍、受傷仆地、當被擒獲、帶至捕房訊問、聞已承認參與殺曹工作、由捕房送往廣慈醫院醫治、一面捕房即派通班探員出動、又通知公共捕房、査緝在逃兇手歸案法辦、</p>
<p>身後蕭條論者惋惜</p>
<p>按曹僞無錫人、年三十歲、妻孫氏、二十六歲、生有一女、名慈慈、現方四齡、平日曹待人接物、極爲和靄、學識豐富、確爲法捕房中之幹練人才、曩昔充任政事部翻譯、旋升督察、八一三後、辦理難民區救濟事宜、極爲努力、成績斐然、特擢升醫察長、惟平時辦事、一本大公、不受人惠、且又樂善好施、致廉俸所入、僅足開支、是以毫無積儲、身後簫條、親朋僚屬、莫不惋惜、聞數月前僞方恐怖團體、曾一度派人在其弄口、擬圖害曹氏、幸於事前破獲、並獲數犯、</p>
<p>最近接獲兩警吿函</p>
<p>父據確悉、在去歲某一時期、正「黃道會一恐怖行動猖獗之時、僞方曾密派恐怖黨徒至西愛咸斯路曹君寓所附近圖謀暗殺曹君、當時宰事先得報、當場捕獲數人、研訊結果、若輩亦直認係受僞方之主使、惟當時捕房方面未予發表、曹君本人事後亦未加注意、直至最近之一月前、曹君又連續接到某方警告函兩封、曹君亦漠然置之、初不料竟禍生肘腋、終遭毒手、</p>
<p>警務總監哀痛下淚</p>
<p>當曹君在醫院殞命之後、法捕房警務總監費白爾氏異常感痛、落淚至再、費氏當時對人表示、謂渠自歐戰以來、對一同供職人員哀痛而至流淚者、當以曹氏爲第一次、良以曹君年少老誠、忠動職守、實爲法捕房警務人員中、將來最有希望之一人、今不幸遭此慘變、殊令人增無窮悼惜、由此足徵曹君生前感人之深矣、</p>

<h3>原料吿罄絲廠停車　春繭開始上市</h3>
<p>「華中公司」放棄統制鄉鎭繭行</p>
<p>上海各絲廠、因原料告罄、相繼停車、江浙春繭、開始上市、「華中公司」放棄鄉鎭繭行之統制、行莊拒絕貸款、保險行拒保各險、廠商對淪陷區收繭、已視爲畏途、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>原料吿罄　絲廠停工</p>
<p>戰後上海四郊以及無錫·嘉興·等處　絲廠商拒絕日方合作、另在滬租界區域設立新　、至四月底止、已完成開工奢、有四十五家、車數的一萬餘部、其中專繼　宮繭者、計有、一家、今因原　乾繭告　、不得已宣告暫行停車者、共有十五家、其軌强開工各廠、俟原料繅完後、亦將停車、預定至本月底以前、大都將臨時停車、俟春繭上市後、再行開車、其能與春繭相接者、僅一二家而已、</p>
<p>各地春繭　開始上市</p>
<p>春繭之上市、以浙江省紹興區爲最早、江蘇省無錫常州區爲最遲、今浙江省內之土種繭子、的本月十七日左右上市、改良種上市、的遲一星期、江蘇省內改良種上市、的在六月初、上海各絲廠本擬向產區收買、今因（一）銀行錢莊停止繭子貸款、（二）保險行不允承保兵火盜險、（三）淪陷區域地方不靖　非淪陷區域如簫紹等處、因滬甬航行斷絕、收得之繭、無法運滬、所以各廠對於收繭、視爲畏途、</p>
<p>放棄統制鄉鎭繭行</p>
<p>華中　除刦奪淪陷區域各絲廠外、企圖統制收繭、曾經辦理繭行登記、今因各地繭行向設在鄕間、城市之中、素無繭行、而各鄕鎭現爲遊擊隊控制之下、奉令對於與「華中公司」有關之繭行、一律予以燬滅、如海寗一縣被燬之繭行、達二十一家之多、於是華中公司除統制城區以內之繭行外、對於各鄉鎮之繭行、予以放棄統制、准許廠商及餘繭商在各鄉鎭自由設行收繭、</p>
<p>浙東春繭　貸款收買</p>

<h3>檢查華字報事件　西報陳述見解</h3>
<p>對當局所遇困難自表同情　若加不正當限制殊難折服</p>
<p>英文大美晚報昨刋題名「警務處與報紙」之社評云、公共租界警務處總巡頃對上海華字報紙、不問其國籍、發出頗强硬之公函、措辭明確、跡近對某種新聞材料、實施檢査、該函內稱、凡有關目前敵對行動政治運動、或政治團體或含有敎唆暴行之演說或宜言、不問其出自任何來源、貴報如欲刋載、概須先交中央捕房特別科獲其許可、函中又有意義重大之語曰、此種預防、目前貴報必洞悉其理由、又謂如未照上述指示先得許可、而逕行刋載、則將吊銷貴報登記證、並將按照工部局所命、採取其他行動云云、</p>
<p>法律觀點</p>
<p>自純粹法律觀點而論、除上海外商出版物作明顯之挑撥、而能根據其所屬國籍之法律、訴諸法庭外、公共租界警務處有無檢査此等出版物之權、或在事實上干涉其出版與銷售之權、乃極可疑之問題、縱起訴之案件、而按照美國之法律、亦無取實際上予以禁止舉動之理由、</p>
<p>為讀者計</p>
<p>在他方面言、際此時期、吾人對兩區外國當局所遇難題、應予以極大之同情、祇須此等當局一日以理自繩、則吾人亦一日不欲吹毛求疵、或過於主張合法權利、吾人相信他報亦以此意爲然、若當局竟至干涉新聞之適當刋載、或忠實發表社評之意見、則吾人不得不甚嚴重的考慮他法、與不正當之限制相搏鬥、或寧願停辦吾人之華文版、而不願少予讀者以彼等所望獲得之道德上的權利、</p>
<p>不合情理</p>
<p>卽如此次之命令、在吾人觀之、仍似非欲對合法之報務作不正當的干涉、所反對刋載者、爲演詞或宣言、其意顯指列載演詞或宣言之全文、吾人不信其對通訊社所發、無論來自重慶或東京之重要演詞的摘要、有加干涉之意、蓋此種態度、不獨不能實行、抑且悖理也、易言之、吾人相信此項命令、意在防杜爲政治原因、以逾度之篇幅、選列文件、而引起指嘀也、</p>
<p>自動默認</p>
<p>在現有情勢下、吾人準備徇從此種願望、吾人以爲普通商業性質、及無政治原因而出版之任何報紙、將默認此種態度爲臨時應急辦法也、但此所謂自動的默認、不應誤解爲服從檢査、曩者中政府管轄上海四週區域時、曾作使吾人之出版物受華方檢査之努力、吾人雖始終表示願意、以吾人認爲基於公正及意識健全之方法、互相合作、但拒不受其檢査、結果、有大體上令人滿意之佈置、</p>
<p>自身檢點</p>
<p>吾人對日方之圖檢査、取同様之見解、加以拒絕、同時亦望自身合理與公平、而非不知存在於租界區域外之局勢、已有變遷而非昔比也、如前所述、吾人不信公共租界當局意欲在防杜本市報紙之政治操縱外、尚有更進一步之行動、吾人之報紙、旣屬商業性質、則吾人熱誠同意上述之總目標、在他方面、吾人對發行被檢査之報紙、殊覺毫無興趣、而不願爲之也、</p>

<p>兒童周刋　母親節特刋</p>
<p>本刋當此母親節日，謹以一瓣心香，萬分誠意，向前錢中國百萬健兒之母親祝福幷致最敬禮。　編者</p>
<h3>從母親節說到母敎</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>母親節又到了，値此鐵蹄遍野之秋，大都骨肉分離，而母親之流離顚沛，自在意料之中，因此我就要談到一個「母敎」的問題。因爲母親與子女一分離，子女勢必失去母敎，這確是一個極嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>什麼是母敎，其實母敎就是家庭敎育。這就是施於孩子未入學前及入學後隨時由母親所施之敎育。當然的，母敎較學校所施之敎育對於孩童有更大的影饗，我們可以說一個人一生的成敗繫在母敎上，記得蔣委員長於五十壽辰時也曾將他的成功歸於他母親的敎訓上，由此我們可以知道母敎的偉大與重要了。</p>
<p>學校裹的敎育是敎我們處世立身之道，母敎雖然也不外這一類東西，然而却還有一伴最重要的東西，那就是「愛」。母親對於子女，處處脫不了「愛」，所以這「愛」就永遠會嵌在孩子的心頭，使會得愛人，體諒人，寬恕人……。而這「愛」實在是世界上最偉大的東西。</p>
<p>我現在所以要提出這問題，就是希望各慈善團體對於失去母親了的孩子的敎育要滲透一些「愛」，使孩子仍舊如同受母敎一般，而將來更有希望成功。</p>
<h3>我的媽媽</h3>
<p>— 民生小學五年級生　牟凌</p>
<p>我的媽媽，很年靑，她有健康的身體，飽滿的精神，一點也沒有蒼老的樣子，我每次跟着媽媽出去，人家總把我的媽媽當作我的姐姐，我是多麼的快活，有這様一個年靑而健康的媽媽。</p>
<p>媽是非常愛我的，和小朋友們的媽媽，一樣的愛着他們的孩子，我也很愛我的媽媽，我想：世界上恐怕沒有一個小朋友不愛他們的媽媽的。</p>
<p>媽待人很和氣，她的臉上，常常帶着和藹的笑容，她對於無論誰，都是十分客氣的，所以她也常常對我說：孩子，你待人接物，要和氣，要謙恭，不要驕傲，驕傲要失敗的。</p>
<p>天氣冷了，媽仍舊每天很早的起身，除了料理家務以外，還替我編織毛綫衣服，所以我的毛綫衣服眞多，大的，小的，深色的，淺色的，花様也不少。我穿了既舒適，叉美觀，人家見了我的衣服，誰都要稱贊媽媽的藝術高超，而羨慕我。</p>
<p>我每天放學回去，媽媽指導我讀書寫字，書裏有不明瞭的地方，媽便細細的給我講解，有時，見我厭倦了，便說一個有趣的故事給我聽，或是說一個笑話，使我哈哈的大笑一陣，便忘了厭倦，又很高興的做功課了。有時候，媽常帶着我去看戲，跑冰……媽是這様的喜歡我，但是，我做了壞事，不聽了媽媽的話，或者不用心讀書。那麼，媽媽也會不客氣的罵我的。</p>
<p>我的媽媽，是一個好嫣媽。我從來沒有離開過她。我願、永遠的在媽媽的懷抱裏過着甜蜜的日子。</p>
<h3>我的媽媽</h3>
<p>— 喇格納小學三年級生　林介媛</p>
<p>我最親愛的人，是我的媽媽。我的媽媽，每天很早起身，喜歡看申報，且喜用國貨，什麼衣料食品用具，究有一件是舶來品，還要勸我們和鄰居服用國貨。她的性情很和善，對待我和哥哥很好。每逢星期日，她伴我們往公園裏去玩，回家休息一會，就呌我們寫字唸書。有時候還呌我們做算術，做得不錯了，就有糖果一袋，或積木一盒做獎品。她在家裏做事很勤，把窗戶擦得很明亮，桌几抹得很潔凈，所以把家務都整理得井井有條呀！</p>
<h3>我的媽媽</h3>
<p>— 一心小學四年級生　楊仰岡</p>
<p>媽媽是世界上最偉大的人，世界上那個人那個動物是沒有媽媽而產生的？</p>
<p>我在民國十四年的一僩嚴冬的晚上，呱呱地鑽出了母胎，投進了人世。從那天起，我經過了媽媽多年的撫育和栽培，送我人學，到了現在，我才算是一個四年級的學生。</p>
<p>大的二年前的某天，我同小朋友們玩小足球，一個小朋友不常心，踢痛了我的脚，我就扳起了面孔，還踢了一脚。不料被媽媽知道了，把我呌到室內，訓了一頓，而且打了十多下手心，我嗚嗚的哭。</p>
<p>我受了這决嚴厲的懲戒以後，知道朋友間應當親愛，不應該吵架。所以從那天以後，我沒有和別人吵架過一决。</p>
<p>一個炎熱的夏天，我不聽媽媽的話，多吃了冰淇淋和西瓜，生了重病，呻吟轉側地睡在牀上，她很憂愁，很着急，不離一步地坐我的身旁，一面忙着替我煎藥，她祇希望我病早些好。經過她多日專心的看護，我病勢已漸漸的痊愈了。</p>
<p>從那天以後，我知道媽媽的話，是不錯的，所以從那天起，媽媽對我說的話，我都聽從她，從沒有違背過一决。</p>
<p>媽媽因爲我能改過自新，所以常常領我去遊公園，看電影，並且常常講故事給我聽，還呌我不要做壞事，我覺得很快樂。</p>
<p>以上的二段事實，是我親自所經歷的，我非常感激媽媽。我希望全世界的媽媽，都能這様的愛護兒子，更希望全世界的小朋友，都能尊重他們的媽媽。</p>
<h3>我的媽媽</h3>
<p>— 華龍小學六年級生　施天容</p>
<p>天底下無論是誰的媽媽，都愛她自己的兒女的，那麼我的媽媽，當然一定是愛我的了。我覺得媽媽的愛我是比無論什麽人來得史愛，就是爸爸也沒有這様的愛我，這因爲我與媽媽是最接近的原因。相是在我有什慶錯的地方，罰起來也是媽媽最兇。記得有一次，我在桌上拿了幾個銅板，沒有告訴媽一聲，後來媽知道了，一定要我說出來，再一定要開我是買什麽東西的。我不說，她就也像學校裏先生那樣的打我手心，後來我說是買糖吃的，於是媽就不打了。她慢慢的對我說，下面一段話：「天容！我並不是不肯給你錢買東西吃，因爲我親眼看見每一個學校的門口，總是圍着許多的攤，什麽小書攤，一毬吃了能壞牙齒的糖攤，還有什麼紅顏綠色的糖水等，這種東西都是對於小學生有害的。另外還有賭攤等，道是最可恨的，給他們騙了錢倒不要緊，但是養成了賭的惡習慣了，將來長大成人後，一定不是個好人。所以我打你，並不是恨你，也不是不喜歡你，而是要你成爲一個好人。倘使肚皮餓了，要吃點心，媽給你買好的東西吃，不要到攤上去買那些不乾凈的東西吃，現在外面毛病很多，不乾凈的東西吃下肚去，是要生病的。再有你在拿無論什麼東西的時候，應當先與媽說一聲，不可偷偷的拿了就跑，在你們這様小的年紀，自己的意識是不够的，所以做事一定要預先與爸爸媽媽商量商量，爸爸媽媽決不會欺騙你的……」，上面就是媽與我說的話，我聽了以爲很對，所以把這段話記下來，給小朋友們大家看看。</p>
<h3>我的媽媽</h3>
<p>— 光華小學五年級生　沈衍兀</p>
<p>我想每一價小孩子都有他的母親，可是我在七歲時我的媽媽他竟拋下了小弟弟和我永遠離開人問了。媽媽是很愛我的，我記得有一個冬天我病得很厲害，天父冷，她坐在我床邊給我倒茶，一夜都沒有睡，這様連着幾天她自己竟病了，可是她還刻刻不忘我，母親的病一天沈重一天，後來我病好了，她就對父親說「元兒你要好好地當心她，給她念書，還有慶兒你將他們帶到他們外婆家去吧！我的病是不－不會好的了」。當時我聽了媽媽的話也不十分懂，我聽說到外婆家去我也高興，就跟父親走了。幾天沒有得着母親消息，有一天父親突然很忽忙來說：「你媽媽快斷氣了，怎麼辦呢」？父親呌我和弟弟一同到醫院裏去和母親最後一面，可是外祖母說：「小孩子別帶去了，元兒叉是病剛剛好。」接着外祖父也回來了，聽了父親的話，也將要哭了，於是外祖父母和父親都坐了黃包車到母親醫院裏去，看這一天晚上我記得他們沒有回來。第二天早晨外祖母回來哭得已不像個人了，他對我望望說：「元兒，以後你是成了一個沒有母親的孤兒了。」我聽到了這句話，雖然不十分明瞭，但見外祖母哭得這様厲害，我也跟着哭起來了。以後我就失了我親愛的媽媽，接着親愛的爸爸也死了，已經四年了，我在痛苦中這樣過去了四年，雖然外祖父母都是愛我的，可是我總忘不了我的媽媽。現在我身體又不好，常常生病，但是媽媽永遠不會來安慰我了。</p>
<h3>我的媽媽</h3>
<p>— 民生小學四年級生　唐圭珍</p>
<p>記得一個冬天的傍晚，灰色的天空裏，飄着紛紛的白雪。大地被籠電着白茫茫的一片。天是那麽嚴寒，西北風呼呼的怒吼着，那時，我正躺在溫柔的被褥裏，嘴裏還不住的嚷着：要吃蛋糕呀！要吃蛋糕呀！媽見我這様，便穿着套鞋，撐着傘，冒着風雪去替我買來了。那時，我祇知吃到蛋糕，目的達到，便罷了。那裏想到媽媽的心！媽見　病了，她慈愛的臉上，帶着憂愁的神色。她盡心竭力的服侍我，安慰我，我病後覺得無聊，要這様，要那様，她總是溫和的慈祥的依順我，從沒有一些厭煩的様子。這還是五年前的事</p>
<p>那時的媽媽，身體也健，精神也好。不想在這短短的五年中，媽的面貌　蒼了許多，額上隱隱的添了幾條縐紋。那當然，媽是爲了兒女操心。從沒有過着安閒的日子。她早起晚睡，料理家務。因爲爸早已去世了，因此全賴媽一人主持。所以媽媽常常對我說：「好孩子！我這樣的辛苦，爲你預備衣食，預備學費，就希望你努力求學，將來做一個有用的人，才不辜負我一番苦心，且能安慰你九泉下的爸爸」。我把媽媽的話，永遠的記在我的心坎裏，作座右銘。</p>
<p>世界上最可敬的，最偉大的，最慈愛的便是媽媽了。小朋友們！大家不要忘掉嫣媽呀！</p>

<p>我的媽媽，待我很好，我每天放學回家的時候，她已經替我預備好點心，給我吃。遇到天冷的時候，就呌我加衣服，天熱了，就呌我减衣服。同時媽媽還費了不少的心血，替我預備一切的生活費用。每逢星期日，媽媽還帶我到公園裹去玩玩，透透空氣。我得到媽媽這様的慈愛，並良好的敎導，自己的良心上，受到了讀書非用功不可的印象，以便將來報答媽媽。</p>
<h3>我的媽媽</h3>
<p>— 民生小學六年級生　汪倩</p>
<p>和我刻不能離的慈母，她盡心竭力地撫養我，造就我。她那和藹慈祥的舉止，無時不深刻在我的腦海裏，她誠是一位很賢淑而合理的媽媽；她對於我是非常疼愛，回憶上月問我在寫字時，頓覺一陣頭昏，身不出主的倒臥下去，俄頃；我睜目一看，自己已躺在床上，母親不住的在旁慰問着；我見了她那像聖母般的溫存仁慈的模様，我的苦楚頓覺釋然。可是我倘有了過失被責罰起來，她的跋詞厲色，瞧去很是肅穆生畏；但媽雖然裝着怒容，她那眉字間的慈意總是隱的可見的。親愛的母親。你那慈嚴兼施的諄訓，使我見了你，又怕又愛。母親，擬的精神是多偉大呀！擬的心地多慈愛呀！天下最慈愛的最神聖的唯有母親了。我們承受了無窮的恩惠，該設法報効。所以我常記住往哲名訓：「大孝係教國保族」這句警語。</p>
<h3>我的媽媽</h3>
<p>— 僑光小學五年級生　郟壽桐</p>
<p>「世界上隨便什麽入，都沒有我的媽媽偉大這一個觀念是永遠的存留在我的腦海中，不僅是我自己這樣想，大概全世界的小朋友也都有這個觀念的吧！</p>
<p>我的媽媽待我非常慈愛，當我生病的時候，她便整天的坐在牀前看護我，甚至寢食俱忘。天冷了，她便急忙的給我做冬衣，天熱了，她又要給我做夏衣。我一天天的增長，媽媽額上的皺紋也一條條的加多。她爲了我，終日辛勞不息，媽媽的恩惠，我什麽時候才能報答完呢？</p>
<p>媽媽不但是這様的愛護我，還是一個熱心愛國的人，她從不買劣貨，一切日用品都是到國貨商店裏去買，並且還勸鄰居也不要買劣貨，又呌我把每日的糖果錢節省下來，捐給國家。媽媽的精神，又是多麽偉大啊！</p>
<h3>我的媽媽</h3>
<p>— 六中級現失學　張仲和</p>
<p>最使我戀戀不捨的，莫過於－媽媽，相愛之深，也莫過於媽媽之愛兒子。允其是我，九歲的時候，便畏逝了我一個最親愛的爸爸，家中只有我與媽媽，所以她是多麽的悲傷，常用慈悲的口音來敎訓我：「要用功讀書，你要知道；世界上沒有爸爸的子女，一定是最……悲……傷，……我們的……目前怎様……下去呢？一她打破這陰沉的空氣，含淚嗚咽了，使我這様。最倔强的脾氣，也慚愧起來，我眞對不起媽，終於伏在媽媽的膝上痛哭：「母親請您原諒我吧！」我現在自省了，沒有爸爸只有靠我用功讀書，使我的爸爸的靈魂，也得快樂，媽媽：「我從今起用功了，不要悲傷吧！」</p>
<p>啊！媽媽從前你對我所說的話，現在我已明白，您眞是我的一個恩人，您是多麽偉大的培棺者，我將來如何報答她，……又怎様去安　她呢？</p>
<h3>我的媽媽</h3>
<p>— 新生小學四年級生　潘志民</p>
<p>我在幼小的時候，我的媽媽繈褓着我，我哭的時候，媽媽就喂牛奶給我吃，常我那時什麼事都不知道，無從記憶。我二三歲　時候，我就漸漸的知道了。直扶養到我四歲的那年，媽媽就送我到幼稚園裏去讀書。記得那時我忽然生病了，媽媽心裏很着急，便去請了一位很有名的醫生來替我診治。服了幾劑藥，幸而病好了，但是飯仍不想吃，媽媽便去買牛肉汁，童鷄汁，火腿等物給我吃，的過了一星期後，就漸漸的恢復原狀了：那時母親才放心。但是爲了這事，母親的面孔却瘦了不少，並且還常常希望我身體好，我想世界上最慈愛的就是我的親娘了。我將來長大了，一定要報答我的媽媽哩！</p>
<h3>我的媽媽</h3>
<p>— 文宗小學六年級生　張晴霞</p>
<p>我的媽媽年紀雖然只有三十多歲，但人家看起來，好像有四十多歲了。她爲什慶這樣的見老呢？因爲她很辛苦！我們兄弟姊妹一共有七個人，一日三餐的烹飪，和治理家政，都是我的媽媽一身肩負。她看見天氣冷了，拿衣服給我們穿，替我們每人做一雙棉鞋，看見三個學校裏去的弟弟冷，媽媽又忙着替他們結絨綫衫。空的時候，還要敎二個小弟小妹識字。又因爲爸爸的經濟困難，所以媽媽更煞費心計，把大弟弟的舊衣服。改給小的弟弟穿。有時我們睡熟了，被頭沒有蓋好，媽媽看見了，就來替我們蓋，只有媽媽來當心我們的寒暖。她費了許多的心血，把我們敎養成人，我們怎様的來報答她呢，我們只有努力求學，謀得將來的自立，來報答我的媽媽罔極之恩了！</p>
<h3>母愛－一九三九年的典型（一）</h3>
<p>— 特也</p>
<p>捷克著名文學家加貝克氏Capek所著「我們生活中的時代」劇本中的精萃</p>
<p>「巴黎市」的節錄</p>
<p>「說明幕中的人物：李佳德夫婦，跟五個兒子安德萊，巨里安，彼得，喬治，唐尼，以及老祖父。（無名）除李佳德之妻跟小兒子唐尼以外，都是亡靈，但他們在冥冥中猶不忘抗戰救國，想勸唐尼的媽媽打發唐尼到前綫助戰。唐尼的媽媽因爲唐尼的四個哥哥都戰死了，所以捨不得再命唐尼從戎，竭力和諸亡靈爭辯，但在唐尼敲門驚醒後，聽了無綫電中報告敵人把學校裹的兒童殺死，因憐痛他人的兒女，立即犧牲她的私愛，命唐尼前去殺敵，這種偉大的母愛，眞正不愧爲母愛的典型。</p>
<p>（臺上的媽媽，和她已死的親愛老小談話，現在和她生存在世界上的，只剩了她的小兒子唐尼。）</p>
<p>媽媽：你不疼愛唐尼麼？可有一點兒疼愛！</p>
<p>爸爸：我們自然疼愛，親愛的，我們眞正很疼愛他。可是我們知道可憐的小羊兒，因爲逼迫留</p>
<p>媽媽：隨他去難受！要是她陪着媽媽，便算大犧牲，那末，他也便不能好好地孝我啦！</p>
<p>安穗萊：他很孝您的媽媽。我們都孝您老人家，您是知道的。</p>
<p>媽媽：不要怎麼說，安德萊。你不知道什麼呌愛情；你們在世上都有旁的目的，比愛情大得多哩。我可沒有旁的目的，李佳德；我心裏想不起什麽更大的事情來。唐尼這小寶貝，我時常攙着他的手，……親天呀！你們都瘋啦！我怎麽能讓這様一個孩子離開我，只有老天知道呀！</p>
<p>明天是母親節，大家來向媽媽行个礼！</p>

<h3>糧食　杜米一律拾伍元　客秈亦到十四元限價　欲期長治久安有所難</h3>
<p>國米市自經隔昨由米糧七團體開會討論、因米市長此飛漲、終非了局、決將限價寬放一元、高白粳限定十五元、不得超越後、昨市到楓涇及南港貨十一艘、車輪包子、到蘇同幫二千餘包、至無錫近日、本已以每車一百二十五包計算、共有六百二十五包抵埠、但因某洋行欲在錫地搜羅大宗米糧、當地無此巨量供應、各行均未接受、該洋行竟惱羞成怒、一與某方關說、認為有意為難、又復籍詞對境、遂使錫米到源又絕、至於全市銷場、囤戶已都停手、僅本街店胃略事添購、然米無論厚薄粳、杜洋尖·埠客尖、均一律到達限價、勢必敲破、楓涇米色最次、亦開至十四元五角、亦興包子貨價相等、因加上袋皮亦須十五元也、</p>
<p>照滬上存米六十萬包計算、寬放限價一元之後、至少獲利八十萬元、惟因米之進本、高低不一、由低而高、故扯計獲利、以一百五十六萬元為相近、尤以銀錢業及殷富之囤戶所得為多、米業中人隨進隨出者獲利較少、資本雄厚者所獲目豐、照現狀若無匡救辦法、米價經三方面互相抬價、迭為因果、大氣漸熱、經過雷蒸之後、米糧勢必折耗、加以棧租拆息等等、有米者又將作一種藉口、而將米價再行抬高、亦所難料、此在有調調民食之責者、應預事注意、若以採辦洋米為補救之工具、不必說舍己有而不用、且欲支出大宗外匯、亦非得計、</p>
<p>變元到銷尚可、惟高貨仍賣十二元半、中米十九元、</p>
<p>客秈昨祗本街暢辦、全日成交不到三千包、至於售價已由市場寬限半元、最高為十四元、逾限巖罰、故南京高秈均開十四元之最高價、而無秈別降一二角、市面似暫告定勢、惟南京當地被禁輸出、特高京當地被禁輸出、特高京秈尚不肯隨市賤脫、洋米自漲到十八元半後、進戶不甚貪辦、市亦轉居定勢、</p>
<h3>粉市平靜</h3>
<p>廠粉　自前日漲風平息後、昨日續告站定、本客均無熱烈需要、而廠方亦無多量供、故大局市面、堪稱供求兩少、據客幫消息、天津方面粉價、合申洋可售五元以上、販運者胃口尚貪、惟廠盤過高、均擬擯小而取、昨市二號粉本街批價續開四元五角、客盤仍加二分半至五分、成交總數、亦不過二分半至五分、成交總數、亦不過三萬包左右、市面尚在酝釀中、</p>
<p>洋粉　交易平靜如故、查「太立體別司」郵船新到之花旗洋粉、大都孰住不出、除直接配銷外、市上流通貨額不多、故人心依然堅強、聞昨有某客幫問津、如舢板牌雙應牌等售價四元五角半現鈔、連費在內、大致與本廠粉相埒、成交約計七千包、市面亦在醞釀中、</p>
<p>出口　七日運天津麵粉一萬二千包、又運汕頭麵粉七千五百包、麩皮一千包、</p>

<h3>關於戰事損失　處理辦法之商榷</h3>
<p>— (續)　陸善熾</p>
<p>（三）任何事業，如年終決算，結有盈餘，除須彌補虧損，並提存法定公積外，股東例可要求派分股息。茲因戰事而受有損害之事業，若以損失列為結轉之虧損，則在未彌補足額以前，縱令結有盈餘，依法股東不得要求派分股息，但如以之列為遞延資產，勢必令本屬虧損者，仍可結為盈餘，本應少結盈餘者，將可多結盈餘，因此股東即得要求派分多量之股息。(蓋既經承認損失可以作為資產於前，即不能限制股東要求派分股息於後。)然此項盈餘，本系虛結，若任其分派，勢必演成將本作息之現象，即在平時，猶屬禁忌，況在事業基礎業已脆弱之戰後，故以戰事損失作為遞延資產之結果，正無異利用會計上之技巧，以公然違背法律上「無盈餘不得派分股息」之規定，此就法律觀點，認為有待商榷者三。</p>
<p>（四）或有人以為將戰事損失，列為遞延資產後，因可分年攤提，結入損費，使以後各年度之純益減少，故在所得稅負擔上，將可較為有利，其實並不盡然。蓋所得稅之計算，須以純益合資本實額之大小，求出比例，以為引用稅率之標準，但稅率有高低，純益亦有多寡，同時各業所受戰事損失之程度，至有不齊，而戰後若干年間之營業成績，各業亦至不一律。若干事業，在某種環境之下，雖可藉戰事損失之作為遞延資產，而在納稅上，成為有利；但亦安知無若干事業，適因將戰事損失作為遞延資產，而反須在納稅上，成為不利。是以就納稅負擔上著眼，將戰事損失作為遞延資產後，政府與工商業，雙方皆屬有利有弊，未可斷論。此就納稅負擔上，認為有待商榷者四。</p>
<p>（五）凡受有戰事損失之事業，其原來積有公積及準備者，在第一年固可以之抵沖，作為彌補，但其不足之額，一經列為資產，則除於每年決算時，可以攤提一部份外，以後雖能結出鉅額盈餘，亦將無法從速彌補。同時在以後結有盈餘之年度，公積是否仍應照提？此項提存之公積，是否仍可陸續之抵沖戰事損失，亦將成為問題。至於戰事損失作為遞延資產後之攤提標準，照經濟部批示，雖云每年不得多於十分之一，但事實上戰事損失，如須在以後數年內陸續決定者，將不免因遞延資產之原額發生變動，而在計算上，感覺困難。此就會計實務上，認為有待商榷者五。</p>
<p>以上所述，不過就思考所及，舉其榮榮大者，實際上恐因各業過去財政基礎有強弱，財產機構有不同，所受損失有鉅細，及未來趨勢有善惡，而使問題之發生，益陷於複雜。由此可知戰事損失，無論在會計理論上，理財政策上，法律觀點上，納稅負擔上，會計實務上，以及戰後復興上，似均不宜以之作為遞延資產處理，而分作十年以上，逐漸攤提。依作者意見，此次戰事結果，工商業所受之損失，固甚重大，但既受之損失，已屬無可挽回，而今後之復興，正應急起直追。是以為工商事業計，與使顧戀殘局，勉強苟延，毋甯忍痛一時，穩健求進。若以為有若干事業，損失過鉅，茍不假予寬貸，恐元氣大傷，難以恢復，因此主張必須講求相當之非常措置者，竊以為亦應從穩健而有效之途著想，而不宜出之於隱蔽損失，或虛抬資產，以徒貽惠。以下姑就鄙意為戰事損失之處理問題，作相當建議，但是否可行，未敢自信，還祈會計界及事業界先進，有以教正之。　　(未完)</p>

<h3>貝多汶音樂會小記</h3>
<p>— 晉華</p>
<p>前天本市貝當路美國教堂開貝多汶的音樂會，以售票所得捐助難民兒童。像這樣慈善的義舉，在半年前曾有過一次「聖城」的大合唱了，其成績卓著，早經當時的中外報紙詳敘了。這回也還是趙梅伯先生指導的大會唱，另外還有幾位名教授的奏演。當今在國難水深火熱之際，我們被遺棄於孤島的人們，悶沉沉地仿佛呻吟都沒有了勁；而在這曾被血染過的，象徵著如火如荼的，含有悲劇氣氛的五月中，這個純粹奏演貝多汶作品的音樂會，將給與人們多少興奮啊！</p>
<p>爲了愛好貝多汶，愛他作品中充滿的熱情，愛他的坎坷一生，表現於作品中所引起人們心靈的同情與共鳴，我便拉著我叔叔和嬸嬸一同去參與這個盛會。我還是第一次參與一個有偉大的Dlass的音樂會。我曾聽過貝氏的生風呢，和鋼琴的Sonata，他的東西決不是那麼容易，那麼輕鬆，那麼明朗，即便是短短的一個鋼琴曲，他給與人的印象是憂鬱－並不是沉默的憂鬱，而是熱烈的，嚴肅地發出來的性震的呼喊，差不多就是你自己的呼喊。</p>
<p>他生平寫過兩部偉大的Ｍass，一是Mass　in　D，另一就是這次演唱的Ｍass　in　C。他寫這種宗教的東西，我們可以在這回Mass　in　C中聽出，他底要附合一種宗教上典型的效果，却較次於表現他的對於上帝的熱忱和虔敬的生命。所以因為他的作品的不多一般專家，都不敢去嘗試。尤其是一個巨大的合唱，想要把他在音樂的本身演出的沒有一點瑕疵，這工作似乎是太難了。這回趙先生不辭辛苦來指揮這樣難的東西，其精神，其毅力深堪佩服了。</p>
<p>八時半，一位年老的教授步到臺上的鋼琴前坐下了，隨後一支小提琴和一支大提琴合了合弦，於是第一個節目Trio開始。柴卡羅夫教授的鋼琴，不用說，遺精到了爐火純青的地步，李夫希教授的小提琴及薛教授的大提琴，都能與鋼琴保持合奏的調和，特別在第三曲開始時，那輕快，敏捷，飄忽的情緒，使得人們都眉飛色舞起來。Trio之後的節目是小提琴與鋼琴合奏Sonata。鋼琴的奏者是位美麗的西洋小姐，她雖然年輕，腕力却很強，所以自始至終沒有使聽眾感到有鬆弛的地方。徐君的提琴力量能夠駕奴住鋼琴，確是很吃力的。他在情緒的表現上，也還美滿。許多外國的聽眾對這位中國提琴家，頗為注意而驚異。</p>
<p>Sonata奏完休息了數分鐘之後，是隆重的Mass　C　開始。當趙梅伯教授登上指揮台時，聽眾迎之以熱烈的鼓掌，於是百餘位的歌者，以及滿堂的聽眾，都隨了趙先生的指揮杖進行著這支大彌撇曲。不知是不是因為指揮的認真，使得每一個歌者都在努力把握住他們精力的集中，所以這個Mass由第一曲至第六曲，他的力量一直是貫注的。當唱至第二曲後部幾個「阿門」時，聲音顯得非常激昂。第五曲四部Solo參入了Chorns，唱來也是非常動聽。這是我個人覺得在這整個的彌撒中唱得最精彩的地方。</p>
<p>至於四位唱的Solo的，則是唱女高音是朱女士，聲音上比較最圓潤，氣量也足；Alto就比較弱些，而且聲音還是不夠低沉，但是音符却頗明晰可聽；Tenor的歌很多，有的地方難民吃力；Baritou的聲音也還是不錯，不過他的機會不多，是很可惜的。</p>
<p>這兒我感覺到有一點，就是唱女高音的人數過多了，以至大合唱的時候，女高音常常遮掩了其他的部份。不過從大體上講，如果我們把我們中國當今的音樂水準提到和其他各國一樣的高，則這次的大合唱雖然不能說是極大的成功，何況這般參與合唱的都是中國的青年學生，在一個僅僅是可能的時期中，訓練著來舉行一個偉大艱深的合唱，有了如此的成績，我們還有什麽苛求嗎？</p>
<h3>誠與僞</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>兵不厭詐，用兵如此，外交何嘗不如此，所謂縱橫捭闔，所謂折衝樽俎，無一處不是手段作用，無一處不是欺騙性質，故老實人不能做外交官。</p>
<p>但是一味用欺騙手段，而他人並非孩子，阿憨，亦決不受其欺蒙，故欺詐伎倆，亦有時而窮，故尤其在利害關係之際，大家應該開心見誠，通力合作。</p>
<p>故以偽待人者，人亦以偽待之；以誠待人者，人亦以誠待之，結果，誠必勝而偽必敗。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第九回　含悲茹苦淚灑四廂　崇儉習勞體勤十畝</p>
<p>他們這一個演劇隊，由金先生王女士領導後，後來到了外國。先到了南陽羣島，繼到了菲列濱，海盜了舊金山，又到了美洲各地。用戲劇的形式，去喚起海外的僑胞，以支持祖國的抗戰。他們預備在海外演劇售券所得，可以集款五十萬元，在國內可以好好兒辦兩個傷兵醫院。誰知道了各地後，吾國僑胞，為他們的演劇所感動的，單單售券所得，就不止五十萬元。此外因演劇感動而捐下來的款子，就合了美金一百五十萬元。他們就在國內辦了不少的小工廠，以支持這班殘廢軍人，能從事生產，藉以度日。所以要說這班演劇隊，在中國戰爭時代的功勞，也著實不小咧。金先生和王女士歸國以後，他們仍在戲劇界努力。這回到東吳大學來，他們就請他的導演這一齣「湘水的眼淚」。因為他們在戰爭時代，也和軍隊在一起。他們也在湖南住了好久，一切背景。他們都有些明瞭。由他來導演，愈加顯得入情入理了。導演先生在幕前的開場白說完了，一陣鼓掌之聲，第一幕的戲劇便開始了。而且在今天這一齣戲中，還有一個奇蹟：在「湘水的眼淚」中，扮演這位女主角湘子兒，也是一位東吳大學的女學生。她姓林，年紀只有十八歲，却生得眉如新月，臉若朝霞。現在的學校中，雖沒有像從前的什麽皇后公主嗎，東宮西宮的，那種近乎侮辱的名詞，但姿色都可稱校中之冠。那位林小姐的父親雖是中國人，母親却是日本人。在前十年，她的那位母親，其命運幾乎也和戲中的湘子一樣。所不同者，林小姐的父親，是一位商人，是一位在南洋的華僑，不及回到祖國來，已經故世了。後來林小姐跟了她的母親，在日本的鄉村中，住了幾年。林小姐一位父親是中國人，她要到中國來。林小姐有位叔叔，也在東吳大學教書。林小姐的外祖家，可憐也沒有什麽人了，因此她便奉母住到蘇州來，依著她的叔父，而自己也就在東吳大學肄業，她當然會說日本話，跟了母親在日本住過幾年，習於日本的風俗。穿了日本女子的衣服，再也教人看不出是中國女子咧。（一○三）</p>
<h3>「衛城記」</h3>
<p>— 燕華</p>
<p>“The　Citader”</p>
<p>米高梅公司出品　國泰戲院開映</p>
<p>當我們激動地聽著勞勃杜奈對醫師公會演講的一段，我們是沉浸在正義與公道的氛圍中了。勞勃杜奈說：「你們總該知道魯意派司脫麼？他何嘗是一個正式的醫師？但是他為醫學界留下多大的功績！……」寫這本「衛城記」的克朗甯，也許也是有感而發吧；最少，作者在這本著作中，是準對著一般庸醫加以激烈的抨擊的。在這樣主題之下，作者創造了一個地方由醫校畢業的年青的醫師，在這個初出茅廬的青年醫師身上，作者付予了極大裏找到一個位置，並且勉強結了婚，但是，他太窮困了，後來為了礦工的反對，他離開了礦區到了倫敦去，在偶然的機會裏，這位年青的窮一生，突然富麗起來了，他和其他的醫師一樣，并不把病人放在心上，直到最後他好朋友死在一個庸醫手裏，他才覺悟起來，在醫師公會裏，把時下醫師大罵一頓。</p>
<p>在這樣故事里，不能不是人想起「萬古流芳」、(即魯意派司脫)與「白衣觀音」這兩部影片，寫醫生與看護為人類服務的崇高精神，是不能不使人感動的。</p>
<p>在一些專門談戀愛講胡鬧的影片裏，最近我們連著看到米高梅公司兩部較為有意義的作品，(蕭伯納的「賣花女」，與這部克朗寧的「衛城記」)這的確是差堪告慰的。</p>
<p>但是在製作技巧上，我認為「衛城記」是遙不可及「賣花女」的，雖然這同樣是在英國攝制的作品，也同樣全片引用很多英國演員，也同樣充滿了英國人那種特殊的氣質，但是，它即使在大導演金維多一手支持之下，也還是覺得不夠緊湊有力的。</p>
<p>假如單論演員，勞勃杜奈的青年醫師，是演得非常精彩的，璐珊玲瓏賽兒飾他的妻子，也很細膩沉著的。但是全片的失敗，並不是演員的失敗，而是劇本及導演的草率。雖然影片已經夠長的了，的那是累贅的地方還是很多，而許多應該描寫的地方，却很草率的讓它過去了。</p>
<p>主要的原因，我覺得編劇者沒有抓住全劇的中心，那就是說，寫青年醫生曼遜後來態度變了以後，應當多多加強地去寫他醫務上的荒唐，以及他有時反省時的痛苦，把許多不必要的場面，如打哥爾夫等等，都可以省去。這樣再寫他覺悟後良心上的譴責，一定會獲得更好的效果。</p>
<h3>撲滅賭風</h3>
<p>— 才清</p>
<p>前昨兩天的報上，刊載著關於賭窟的各種新聞：　滬西越界區域將增設三賭窟：　租界當局嚴厲執行封鎖賭窟交通：　賭博輸負侵佔賬款。由於這三種新聞的同時刊出(如果再注意一下的話，過去的報上，是有著更多的記載的。)，我們可以猜想到這毒害人羣，擾亂治安的賭風，恐怕又有恢復以前那樣茂盛的趨勢了。</p>
<p>在民國十六七年的時候，上海租界上的賭窟，也曾造成了最高的恐怖記錄，但終於在租界當局的努力了整飭之下，消滅了這造成罪惡的發源地。前年戰爭發生以後，越界區域一帶的賭窟又蠢然而動，甚至刊登廣告，散發傳單，誘致人們去賭博。而租界當局，因為警權所不能及，祗能如何防範著使它不致蔓延到界內來，如嚴厲執行封鎖賭窟交通，這就可見在警權以內盡了最大的努力了。但是賭窟的增設，與乎賭負侵佔的發現，也可見終有一部份糊塗的人，不自知地跌進地獄裏去了。</p>
<p>戰事以後，上海的生活程度日高，而失業者又增多，醫師糊塗，存了僥倖之心，到賭窟去背城借一，說起來似乎是值得我們憐憫的，但是能夠靜下心來想一想，除了一切「保護費」「開消」等浩大支出外，還有駭人聽聞的利潤，它們不在賭客身上收回來，這些賭窟如何能存在下去？於其存僥倖之心，不如以這份精神來努力自己的事業，「奮鬥才能生存」，是每一個人的座右銘。這樣，這些建築在脆弱的「機會」上的賭窟，也會自生自滅。所以，租界當局的封鎖賭窟交通，和每個人不去賭，是消滅賭窟的最好合作辦法。</p>

<h3>戰時的日本電影</h3>
<p>— 辛一</p>
<p>自從日本發動侵華戰爭後，他們的電影事業，逐漸趨於衰沉，而近來日本的色情影片的流行，更可以說是不景氣的反映，並足以證明他們實施戰時文化政策的失敗；原來對於人民思想自由過度的控制的結果，只有使人們加深反動心理。要想拿藝術來鼓勵所謂「光榮的戰爭」，藉以麻醉人民去參加他們認為神聖的法西集團，便不得不先來約束人民的思想。他們深知電影的題材，如果不把牠限制到狹義的「歌頌戰爭」的範圍內，那也許對於軍閥們的侵略行動有很大的不利，但是日本人民在重重的壓迫下，他們早已看出軍閥們的期盼手段，再也不願受他們的驅使，像羔羊般的帖服在可惡的軍人手下了。</p>
<p>電影是社會的寫照，文化的宣傳，在現代國家中，牠已無疑地成為一種大眾所需要的精神食糧。日本的民眾，既揭穿了軍閥們麻木的宣傳，和種種私利的欺騙的企圖，自覺地丟開了讚揚「皇軍」的盛德和描寫「神聖的戰爭」底各種影片，便不得不向另一面去尋找他們的淨勝的食糧了。就在這種情形下，色情影片成了一種畸形的發展。由於國內抑制不住的反戰情緒的高漲，迎合低級趣味的色情影片，便呈現出活躍的趨勢。我們推測這種色情影片流行的原因，無非要想借此發洩一下大眾積鬱著的苦悶的心情，和緩一下他們的矛盾的思想，並給以大眾一種高度的刺激，使他們暫時忘記他們自身所遭受的苦痛。影片的題材離開現實愈遠，在軍閥們的心裏，或許是認為有利的吧？</p>
<p>一位日本的老教授說：「炮火轟毀了象牙塔」，是的，日本戰時的電影再不會找到文化與藝術的價值。</p>
<p>軍人們看到這點，不免隱憂滋生，於是文相荒木在一度招待電影界解釋政府新通過的禁止青年看愛情影片的法律之後，最近又禁攝描寫僥倖運游戲的影片了。這到令我們有些不解；不知所謂幸運遊戲的影片，是否指戰爭影片，他們既只倖運遊戲的不當，那麼他們對華侵略，是不是賭博式的孤注一擲的倖運呢？</p>
<p>因為提倡戰爭電影的結果，日本電影界所表現的各種矛盾的形態，將愈益明顯；而日本的文化與藝術也都葬送在軍閥們的掌握中，只要看日本電影在刀槍下的彷徨，便可見一斑了。</p>
<p>迷途的羔羊</p>
<h3>葛佐治不幹電影</h3>
<p>— 慧存</p>
<p>將到菲律賓　學習無綫電</p>
<p>現在香港的童星葛佐治，他依舊像在「迷途的羔羊」一片中的活潑可愛，不過，他雖然還是一個小孩子，可是他對於成人的一切都了解得透切了。見到他的人，因而常常會感到他現在已有著成人的習氣了。他們也許要懷疑他在上海時的天真姿態，怎麼會消失得這樣的快速呢？是不是香港的環境造成了他，還是他自己的心理變態呢？</p>
<p>他今日很少演戲，終日還是閒著，聽說他最遲在六月以前，他將要到菲律賓去。因為他又一位伯伯，在那邊海關辦事，還有幾個哥哥，也同在一處做事，內中有一個哥哥是無綫電公司裏的高級職員，他到那邊去的目的就是想學習無綫電。</p>
<p>哥佐治的家庭經濟環境並不大好，而目前的生活狀況並不見佳。現在人家又不讀他演戲，本來，童星在香港一向是不為人所注重的。所以，他必要脫離影界到另一社會去找出路了。</p>

<h3>大舞台藝員　慰問孤軍</h3>
<p>— 靜廬</p>
<p>移風劇社發起去慰問孤軍以後，大舞臺藝員也接著響應，結果共捐得五十一元，買了八打的罐頭牛肉和四打的鳳尾魚，就在前日下午備了一封公函，由李瑞來，韓文奎，李君玉及記者，並請移風社的王仲平嚮導。</p>
<p>我們到了那裏，經過簽名的手續，就進到了孤軍營，來接見的是上官志標，唐棣，雷雄三位連長，先由上官連長領導在他們的宿舍參觀一下後，就在他的臥房坐著談話。</p>
<p>他們對於我們所送的食品表示感謝，並且說：「祗要你們能夠來看我們一下，不必帶什麽東西，也感到非常的安慰了。」上官連長拿熱水瓶替我們倒茶，大家忙稱謝不必，他含笑地道：「你們到這裏來，沒有什麽招待，難道還替我們省一些開水？」他倒好就一杯一杯的遞到我們手裏，我喝著這杯開水，真覺得和玉液瓊漿一般有味，聽了他的話，幾乎感動得掉下淚來。</p>
<p>雷連長很起勁報告，以前一切壯烈光榮的經過，並且說，他一出去就可以當律師了，而且家裏也有父母妻子，但住在這裏，並不感到怨恨。</p>
<p>我們談了許久，覺得應該走了，就像諸位親愛的戰士們告辭，互訂後會。他們送到一個有白俄守著的小門口就止步道：「這鐵絲網以內，是我們的範圍，祗能送到這裏了，再會吧。」我們鞠躬告別，但聽到這兩句話，又不覺淒然，眼眶裏總含著沒有流出來的熱淚，悵惘地走了回來。</p>
<p>據說，移風劇社今天要到孤軍營去演劇，不知能否成為事實。</p>
<h3>黎園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>民國後伶人身價抬高的原因</p>
<p>同時還有一位身體肥碩的闊客，前呼後擁的走進戲園子來，吳總長每日下午除有時舉行甚麼會議外，餘下空的時間舉行甚麼會議外，餘下空的時間總是耽擱在尚老闆寓中，後來這位總長大人簡直就命部員們帶著公文送到小雲家裏批閱，好在尚家有的是裏廳·外客廳·小書房·賓客雖眾，也可容納得下，一時椿樹胡同尚宅門前，車水馬龍，擁擠不堪，大政客既以捧戲子為樂事，於是一般無聊小政客們，也就迎合大政客的所好，莫不極力拉攏名伶，一位他們陞官發財，營謀差缺的終南捷徑。尚小雲既在吳毓麟前說一不二，因之一般交部員司，和想在該部謀個枝樓的人們，無不把小雲捧的和天神一般。小雲每好自稱尚王爺，時時露出驕矜的樣子來，十九都是那一個時期養成了他的惡根性呢。有一次他在上海搭班，期滿北上的時候，忽在凌浦路上失落了一個皮夾子，他幾乎氣的哭了出來，(撒驕)立時著人把車守及查票員都喚到他的包房裏，開口就說道：「好，咱們爺們的東西也會丟啦！倘是找不回來的話，你們的差事也別想幹啦」！直嚇得這般人手足失措，連忙問他損失多少錢，大家情願湊了啦出來，賠還了他。誰知這位尚王爺一定不肯，非要把原物找回，不肯饒恕他們。車抵天津時，站長段長一齊前來向他道歉，他雖是勉強允了，可是到了北京見了他乾爸爸吳二爺之後，依舊鬧著要把斷長車守等撇差。後來有人告訴他，別為這點小事鬧大啦，惹起外界的公憤，那就顯著面子上不好瞧啦。他這才明白過來，究竟自己是個唱戲的，憑什麽撇這個，換那個，因此就將這件事擱起來了。</p>
<p>我們試把程硯秋·尚小雲·和周信芳·孫菊仙·的身價抬高的原因來比較研究一下，就可知道兩者是不大相同的了。幸而北伐後一般　軍閥政客都完全消滅啦，如其不然的話，恐怕凡是想在軍政界謀點小差事的人，都得要先去奔走名伶之門，然後才可以如願以償呢。試問那還成個國家麼？—(五)—</p>

<p>Yicheng: The war in central Hubei is intensifying. A major bloody battle has formed east of Suixian. On the 4th, most of the Japanese troops moved north from Yujiadian, east of Suixian, and have been engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with Chinese forces east of Gaocheng for several days. On the 6th, a small number of Japanese troops remained unsuppressed at Qingshuizhai. The Japanese army has been conducting joint land-air attacks on Tajianwan, northeast of Suixian, for five days. To facilitate flanking attacks on the Japanese, Chinese forces voluntarily withdrew from Tajianwan on the 5th. A major clash between Chinese and Japanese forces occurred at Jiangjiahe, northeast of Tajianwan. From the 3rd to the 6th, Japanese casualties exceeded one thousand, but the Chinese positions remained steadfast. In the Maping area of ​​Zheshui, Chinese forces continued their fierce offensive on the 6th. The Chinese left detachment launched a surprise attack on the vicinity of Beiyan Mashan in Zheshui at 3:00 AM, engaging in a bloody battle with over a thousand Japanese troops stationed there. The fighting involved repeated assaults, resulting in heavy Japanese casualties, though the Chinese also suffered considerable losses. The fighting north of Zhongxiang was relatively subdued. Approximately 300 Japanese troops south of Banbianjie, east of Yangzi, made contact with Chinese forces on the 5th but were repeatedly repelled. Chinese troops crossing the river are still fiercely attacking Lijiazhai on the Jingzhong Road, and Huangjiadian has also been recaptured by the Chinese army. The Japanese forces are fleeing north, and Chinese troops are intercepting them.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Catastrophe in Chongqing</h3>
<p>After the large-scale bombing of Chongqing by Japanese aircraft on May 3rd and 4th, the number of civilian casualties reached a new record since August 13th. It is reported that the most bustling streets of Chongqing were turned into scorched earth, and the total number of Chinese civilians and some foreigners killed and injured reached approximately five thousand. Indiscriminate bombing of various parts of China by Japanese aircraft was already commonplace, and whenever the Japanese army suffered a defeat, they would intensify their aerial atrocities, indiscriminately bombing undefended Chinese cities. However, the bombing of Chongqing, Ningbo, Fuzhou and other places proves that the Japanese army has suffered general defeats on the northern and southern battlefields in the last month. Is this really a strategy? This is venting anger, this is covering up shame!</p>
<p>We express our infinite condolences to the Chinese people who have tragically suffered death and injury, and the separation of families and the loss of property due to the bombing by Japanese aircraft in various places in the past; the large number of sacrifices suffered by the citizens of Chongqing and foreign residents this time makes every rational person in the world feel deeply heartbroken. The international community should not turn a blind eye to this phenomenon, whether for justice or for humanitarian reasons. However, written protests and verbal condemnations cannot force her to correct "planned atrocities". Therefore, in addition to disaster relief such as rescue and relief, we must work hard to participate in it. Fundamentally, we must also seek effective ways to sanction atrocities. Sanctioning atrocities is not a piecemeal matter, we should seek a thorough solution. Every Chinese person of course knows how to fulfill his national responsibility during the war of resistance, and everyone who sympathizes with China, at least for the sake of not being able to sit idly by and watch the atrocities, should use its strength to help China resist the war and jointly strive for the final victory; We firmly believe that the day of China's victory is the day when Japanese atrocities end.</p>
<p>Empty curses of atrocities are ineffective. Perpetrators of atrocities will eventually reap the rewards. Look at various parts of China. On the one hand, they have suffered losses due to air raids, but at the same time, they are strengthening their resistance forces there. This is by no means sophistry. Originally, Japanese aircraft wreaked havoc, not distinguishing between the front and the rear, demonstrating their power to the Chinese people everywhere, which also sparked the flames of resistance everywhere and stimulated every Chinese person's understanding of the enemy's atrocities. It can be said that the effectiveness of a bombing is greater than that of ten battlefield battles, and is greater than that of a thousand national education lectures. At the same time, every ruthless bombing by Japanese aircraft, killing innocent civilians and destroying cultural institutions, will inevitably arouse widespread attention and deep concern from people around the world, which can also promote a great force that can promote the world's disgust for Japan and the world's practical assistance to China. The bombing of Chongqing this time was certainly more tragic than any previous one, but it also stimulated the strength of the Chinese people and those around the world who sympathized with China more than any previous one. Because this is not only an unprecedented amount, but also a qualitative seriousness.</p>
<p>Why is it qualitatively serious? First, from the point that the target of this bombing of Chongqing was entirely in the downtown area, it can be seen that the Japanese army deliberately targeted Chinese civilians. Objectively, this will inevitably strengthen the anti-war consciousness of the general public, but in the subjective view of the Japanese, the massacre is a demonstration. Although Chongqing is the new capital of China during the war of resistance, in fact, all important military and political institutions have long been evacuated to other places. Is there any reason why the Japanese side does not know this? Even if it is said that some institutions still remain in Chongqing, it is worth bombing; but the actual target of the Japanese aircraft's bombing was not in the government agency area, but in the commercial and residential areas of Chongqing. One bombing was not enough, so they continued with a second bombing, resulting in countless civilian casualties, corpses lying everywhere, and the fire not extinguished for three days, with the disaster area reaching more than two kilometers. Is this not intentional slaughter of civilians?</p>
<p>Second, from the fact that this bombing of Chongqing destroyed the embassies and consulates of various countries, it can be seen that the Japanese army also intends to provoke various countries in the world. Originally, the embassies and consulates of various countries in Chongqing were all located on the top of the mountain, with clear flags and clear locations. Japanese aircraft bombing during the day cannot excuse themselves by claiming poor visibility. However, the Japanese aircraft bombed the embassies and consulates in the same way, indicating that it must have been intentional. The country that suffered the most damage was the United Kingdom. Ambassador Kerr was in Chongqing, the consulate was destroyed, and the ambassador's secretary, Taylor, suffered minor injuries. This was by no means an accidental coincidence, but simply a planned provocation by Japan against the United Kingdom, which was closely related to the anti-British movement instigated by the Japanese in the occupied areas. At the same time, it is also related to the fact that the Japanese cabinet did not listen to the military's demands and did not conclude a comprehensive military alliance with Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>The atrocities of the Japanese army will not stop temporarily. The bombing of Chongqing and other cities will inevitably continue to occur as the Japanese army suffers defeats on the battlefield, but China's resistance forces will inevitably strengthen in inverse proportion, and the sympathy and assistance of various countries in the world to China will inevitably deepen in inverse proportion. Only the aggressors themselves can realize the gains and losses in this!</p>
<h3>After the Yushi Attack: The Great Fire Was Extinguished Yesterday Morning, with One-Third of the City's Houses Destroyed; Casualty Statistics Still Unavailable</h3>
<p>The British Embassy Was Affected and Has Protested to Japan</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Today at noon, the air raid alarm sounded, and Chinese fighter planes immediately took to the skies, forming a battle array in preparation. However, the attacking Japanese planes did not appear, and the alarm was lifted after an hour. The fires that had erupted in various parts of Chongqing on Thursday due to the Japanese air raid were extinguished early this morning. However, some streets were still blocked due to collapsed walls. Water, electricity, and telephones have been repaired in several places. The number of casualties has not yet been accurately determined because the affected area is quite large, and some areas have not yet been reached by rescue teams. It is believed that many bodies are buried in these piles of rubble. It is generally believed that since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, the casualties from Japanese air raids have been highest in Chongqing on May 4th. According to reliable sources, the number of casualties is estimated to be between four and five thousand. A Reuters correspondent, while touring Chongqing last night, found that several places were still burning. Apart from the burned areas, Chongqing was entirely in darkness. The few people seen on the streets were mostly those who had fled during the air raids of May 3rd and 4th and were now returning to the city to check on their homes or retrieve the few essential items they had been unable to take with them before. At the same time, rescue workers continued their service. Many civil servants from government offices have formed teams to assist in sending refugees to other places. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has appointed Minister He to be fully responsible for handling relief matters. The Chairman and Madame Chiang Kai-shek's personal cars are now being used to transport refugees, and the Chairman's guards are also assisting in the relief work. The nine newspapers in this city jointly published a single newspaper this morning, and its editorial stated that this may be one of the most tragic pages in the history of Chinese newspapers, but expressed China's determination to continue the war of resistance under any circumstances. Our response to the enemy's barbaric behavior is to strengthen the unity of our organization, thereby shattering the enemy's attempts to destroy us. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The extent of the loss of life and material damage caused by the Japanese aircraft bombing in Chongqing on the 4th of this month has not yet been accurately tallied this morning. The city is desolate, and the homeless wander the streets, searching for the remains of their relatives in the rubble. The scene is so tragic that it brings tears to the eyes of those who see it. On that day, at 6:00, Japanese planes flew over the city of Chongqing in formation, dropping countless incendiary bombs, causing one-third of the entire city to catch fire. The consulates of Germany, Britain, and France were all on the bombing route. The Guangzhou consulate was only affected, so the damage was small. The British and French consulates were both hit by bombs, causing injuries to those seeking refuge there. The Guangzhou consulate building was intact, but there was fire on three sides, so there was also damage. Many parts of Chongqing's largest street have not yet been extinguished since the bombing the day before yesterday. Among the missing foreigners are two Germans. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The scene here is extremely tragic after the large-scale Japanese bombing on Thursday. Many foreign doctors fear that an epidemic may occur, posing a great danger to the city's residents. There are still hundreds of bodies buried in the rubble, and it will take several days to clear them all, according to rescue workers. The most worrying thing is that Chongqing has two million rats, which are very active, and there is a possibility of causing a disaster. Also, when the Japanese planes dropped bombs, they also dropped a large number of leaflets, generally saying that Japan was determined to "level Chongqing to the ground," so the general public was even more panicked. Since yesterday, people have been leaving in groups, carrying whatever they could find and carry. At the same time, rumors are rife here, saying that Japanese planes dropped many cigarettes containing poison. After investigation, it was found that a cigarette factory was bombed, and cigarettes were scattered everywhere. Last night, many relatives of the deceased went to the pile of corpses to identify the bodies. At the same time, petty thieves were searching the corpses for gold and silver jewelry, even knocking out the gold teeth in the mouths of the corpses. Later, the military police arrived to suppress the situation, and the theft subsided. However, yesterday's stench was only the stench of burned corpses, but by today, many of the corpses have rotted. At the same time, rescue workers have not been able to completely remove the corpses. The government has now allocated three million yuan to provide relief to the affected people and has requisitioned public and private vehicles to evacuate the population. Also, when Japanese planes appeared in the sky, firefighters, paramedics, and police officers all rallied to carry out rescue and maintain order. This point has aroused the admiration of foreigners. As for the fire caused by the incendiary bombs, it invaded Chongqing's main streets in the evening, so that the area affected by the fire was twice as large as the area destroyed by the bombs. The theaters were also almost affected, but after a heavy rain, the fire was extinguished. However, after this heavy rain, the hardship of those who were homeless and fled to the suburbs greatly increased. (Associated Press, 6th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) After the continuous bombing of Chongqing by Japanese planes in recent days, a large number of residents have been actively evacuating since the night before. Yesterday alone, more than 100,000 people left Yushi to evacuate to nearby towns. All means of transportation, such as cars, transports, buses, sailboats, and rickshaws, were used for evacuation. Several refugee camps have been established near Chongqing. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) All the convenient facilities in Chongqing are now in chaos, so the current living conditions here are extremely miserable. Food is almost nowhere to be found, all the restaurants are closed, and even if residents prepare meals, it is difficult because rice, water, vegetables, and meat are not easy to obtain. The refugees leaving for other places are walking along the streets in an endless stream. The government's measures to deal with this situation are admirable, arranging transportation to evacuate the thousands of refugees pouring out of the city. Minister Kong has allocated one million yuan to cover relief expenses. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally inspected the relief efforts yesterday afternoon, and Madame Chiang Kai-shek also led a women's relief team to work from early morning to late at night. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) On the 3rd of this month, Japanese planes suddenly attacked Chongqing, and two large planes were shot down by the Chinese Air Force, which fled in a panic. On the 4th, they attacked again, bombing the embassies and consulates of Britain, France, and Germany. The extent of the damage is briefly described as follows: (1) The British Embassy and Consulate were both bombed, one foreigner was injured, and more than 20 Chinese people died. (2) Two bombs fell on the French Consulate, one did not explode, and one fell in the corridor, and the building was completely destroyed. (3) Fire broke out around the German Consulate, and the fire spread, causing great damage to the building. (4) The American Church on Cangping Street was completely burned down. The Japanese military's disregard for international law is intended to threaten the interests of various countries in China and follow its attempt to dominate East Asia. It is even more obvious that there are no longer any scruples in its mind. However, yesterday the Japanese side falsely claimed that the Chinese side fired anti-aircraft artillery near the embassies and consulates, hoping to confuse the public and shirk responsibility. Chongqing is now the capital of China, and dignitaries from various countries are concentrated here. In order to protect the safety of dignitaries from various countries, there are absolutely no anti-aircraft units near the embassies and consulates. This has long been known to people from various countries. The Japanese military's false propaganda is enough to show its brutal behavior and attempt to cover up its mistakes. (6th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The number of casualties and property losses from the air raid on Thursday were heavy, and the fire that broke out continues to burn. It is now estimated that the casualties are 5,000. British Embassy and Consulate personnel have now withdrawn from the Chongqing site and gone to a certain place on the opposite bank of the river. A German woman, Mrs. Herbach, was found dead near the Guangzhou consulate yesterday, apparently killed by a bomb while trying to take refuge in the German consulate. The German consulate itself was spared from being affected by the surrounding flames and was undamaged. An incendiary bomb was dropped in the courtyard of the French consulate, but there were no casualties, and the building was undamaged. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable sources, regarding the damage to the British Consulate General in Chongqing during the air raid on Thursday, British Ambassador to Japan Craigie made a verbal protest to the Japanese government yesterday. It is reported that Mr. Craigie pointed out the seriousness of the Japanese move and said that the so-called anti-aircraft guns near the consulate were "completely unacceptable." The British Ambassador also requested the Japanese government to take appropriate action to remedy this incident. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A Navy Ministry spokesman said today that the Japanese Air Force will continue to attack Chongqing, the seat of the Kuomintang government, and other military locations, without the slightest slackening, until the anti-Japanese Kuomintang government is defeated. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Air Defense Headquarters here received a report at about 10:00 a.m. on the 6th, saying that several Japanese planes were attempting to invade Yushi from the west. After issuing an air raid alarm at noon, the Japanese planes, seeing that the Chinese side was prepared, turned and flew elsewhere, so the alarm was lifted. (6th)</p>
<h3>The Military Commission Announces Weekly Battle Situation</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Military Commission said that during the week (April 28 to May 4), the enemy forces on the northern and southern fronts were continuously and fiercely attacked by our attacking troops, resulting in many victories and the recapture of many places, causing the enemy to flee in embarrassment. The important results are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong Front: Around Guangzhou, Sanshui and Xinjie have been successively recovered, Zengcheng has been captured twice, and important strongholds such as Fuhe and Shikang have been successively captured. In the Paitan area, more than 800 officers and soldiers, including the enemy's Regimental Commander Takeshita Kitaro, have been killed. Now the outer perimeter is completely controlled by us, and the encirclement is getting smaller and smaller. This week, a part of our surprise troops once entered the city, killing more than 500 enemies. The enemy's families have been evacuated. The 3,000 to 4,000 enemies in Xijiang, Xinhui, and Jiangmen have been attacking Heshan, Daze, and Zhuliuhe in the west for days, and the momentum is extremely fierce. Our army bravely resisted and fought fiercely for three days and nights. Although each of these places was once lost, they were completely recovered by the 30th morning. In the battles of Zhuliuhe and Daze, more than 1,300 enemies were killed. In the battle for Heshan, more than 1,000 enemies were also killed, including 15 officers at the school-level. All their hundreds of barrels of gasoline were captured. Now our army has forced Xinhui and Jiangmen. In the three areas of northwest Jiangxi Province, our army has an absolute advantage. In addition to their exhaustion, the enemy may make a desperate struggle.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Front: Our army, active in Jiangxi Province, captured Gao'an last week, besieged Wuning, and forced its way to Nanchang. Since this week, although the enemy has done its best to counterattack us, our army has continued to advance with the momentum of sweeping away the fallen leaves, completely breaking the enemy's struggling attempt. Now the enemy has been almost completely eliminated from the four suburbs of Wuning and the four suburbs of Gao'an. On the afternoon of the 29th, our army once rushed into the city. The strongholds of Xiangfuguan, Dachengzhen, and Gaoyoushi northeast of Gao'an have all been captured. We are now besieging Fengxin on three sides and bombarding it fiercely. On the 27th, a large fire broke out in the city, and the enemy's barracks, munitions, and ammunition were all reduced to ashes. On the Fushui River on the front of Nanchang, Hengxi, Liantang, Xiangtang Shengmi Street, Xiefu City, and Wenshui Street, all the important places have been recovered by us one after another, and we have joined forces with the elite troops of Dacheng and Gaoyou to attack fiercely. The enemy resisted stubbornly, and we were defeated step by step. Now our vanguard has forced its way to the city gates and is sweeping away the remnants of the enemy. In recent days, in the Wuning, Gao'an, and Nanchang areas, the number of enemies killed is no less than 2,000. The enemy is doing its best to conscript reinforcements.</p>
<p>Hubei Front: About 2,000 enemies in the Maping, Xihe, Haojiadian, and Xujiadian areas in northern Hubei launched a rapid offensive against the Senlin Temple, Dushan Town, Sanliza, and Quankou Town from the morning of the 30th. Under the encirclement and attack of our large army, more than 1,000 were killed or wounded, and the offensive was frustrated. On the east bank of the Hanshui River, near Luohan Temple, the enemy bombarded Shayang with artillery all day on the 2nd, and launched a large number of poisonous gas bombs. By dawn on the 3rd, our army crossed the river in two routes to launch an attack. At that time, the enemy on the east bank could not resist and immediately collapsed. Without a fight, the important strongholds of Luohan Temple, Duobao Bay, and Sigang City were all recovered. Now we are pursuing the defeated enemies in three routes towards Tuochuanbu, Yonglong River, and Yangjia. The enemy in Tianmen is extremely shaken. Our army attacking Macheng in eastern Hubei captured the county seat on the 30th. On the afternoon of the 1st, we took advantage of the victory to successively capture Zhongguan Zhou and marched towards Songbu. On the same day, we attacked and wounded the enemy's aircraft at Takou, annihilating more than ten enemy soldiers. At that time, all fifteen aircraft in the field were burned down. Our army in southern Hubei is now besieging Tongcheng and Chaoyang. Our army is also divided into two routes, one approaching Zhangzhai and the other pointing directly at Xianning.</p>
<p>Shanxi Front: Our army in Shanxi Province gave separate blows to the enemies who were moving around this week. In southern Shanxi, from the morning of the 2nd, there were fierce battles in Quwo, Shouyang, Zhangdian Town, Wenxi, Anyi, Fushan, and Yicheng. More than 1,000 enemies were killed, and the traffic in each place was completely destroyed, making it impossible for the enemy to communicate. The enemies who invaded the Baijin Highway in Pingyao and Taigu in eastern Shanxi were defeated on all routes on the 28th after a bloody encounter for more than ten days, abandoning more than 3,000 corpses. In the Lishi area of western Shanxi, the enemy army was encircled and severely attacked by us with the force of a swift storm, annihilating five or six hundred people. The remnants of the enemy entrenched in Jingle and Shenchi in northern Shanxi are still under our siege and can be easily annihilated. In total, since this week, our army has killed about 8,000 enemies on all routes. The enemy division commander Taniguchi was seriously injured in the battle of Fushan and is rumored to have been killed. The unit commander Mi in the battle of Anze was also killed at the same time. The enemy was extremely frustrated by this heavy blow and could not do anything about the Datong-Puzhou Railway. In addition, Bo'ai in northern Henan Province, an important stronghold, was also captured. In southern Henan, the enemy who broke through from Xinyang to the northwest was defeated. Wen Deng County in Shandong Province was recovered, and Yixing in northern Jiangsu Province, which had fallen into enemy hands for more than ten months, was reunited with the national emblem on the 3rd and returned to our control. The encirclement of Honglanbu and the control of Nanjing on the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway are also our great victories. In Suiyuan, the PingSui Railway and the provincial automobile road were destroyed, making it impossible for the enemy to resume transport and communication between Datong, Baotou, and Bailingmiao. The entire Northwest battlefield is under our control. These are all important achievements within this week, and they have had a great victory in hitting the enemy's conspiracy and promoting the might of our army. (6th)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) The National Government issued an order on the 6th, stating that State Councilor Xie Chi was a man of great insight, lofty aspirations, and pure loyalty. He joined the League early and was relied upon by the late Premier. He made great contributions to the restoration of eastern Sichuan during the Xinhai Revolution.

<h3>Exhibition of Chinese Dynastic Court Costumes in Greater London</h3>
<p>Ticket Revenue to Be Used for Relief Funds</p>
<p>(London) The "Exhibition of Chinese Dynastic Imperial and Ministerial Court Costumes" organized by the China Society here intends to donate the ticket revenue to the relief efforts for refugee children led by Madame Chiang Kai-shek, wife of Military Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. It officially opened on Wood Day, with Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi opening the ceremony. First, the President of the China Society, Sir Malcolm, delivered a welcome speech to Ambassador Guo, followed by Ambassador Guo giving a speech, expressing his gratitude to the China Society and those who enthusiastically supported it, and saying, "The works of art displayed here are all related to our country's culture. British audiences can use it to gain insight into the artistic instincts of our nation, and the sympathy of the British people for China is also expressed through the visit." Those who are collecting here are embroidery and other works of art from the 10th to the 19th centuries, and the collectors of various countries have generously agreed to lend them for display, which is especially admirable. Then, the Director of the British Albert Museum, Ashelton, continued to speak, saying, "Chinese silk embroidery is world-renowned. As early as hundreds of years ago, there were various exquisite products from China. The Danzig Free City Museum currently also has hundreds of years of Chinese embroidery, which can serve as proof. This kind of art has been passed down to this day and is still extremely developed, which is indeed rare and valuable." According to this decision, among the court costumes displayed, the most valuable is the military uniform of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty and the ceremonial robes worn by the emperors during sacrifices. In addition, there is also a piece of jade, uniform in color, 61 cm long and weighing 11.82 kg, which is truly a beautiful material that cannot be seen often. And various exhibits are attached with detailed instructions, so that the audience can understand at a glance, and can also grasp the outline of Chinese culture and philosophy here. (Havas, 5th)</p>

<h3>Securing the Eastern Mediterranean: Anglo-Turkish Agreement Concluded; Proposal for a Three-Power Military Alliance; British Reluctance to Agree with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Havas, Paris: Although Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov has been removed from his post, the country's foreign policy will not change as a result. Britain and the Soviet Union will continue negotiations based on Britain's latest proposal. Soviet sources here say that Japan, fearing that Britain might accept certain constraints from the Soviet Union in the Far East, is eager to prevent this. It has declared that if Britain does not provide assistance to the Soviet Union in the Far East, Japan will not change its anti-communist pact into a military alliance treaty. Britain, fearing that Japan might adopt a hostile attitude towards Western European democracies after it signs an agreement with the Soviet Union, remains hesitant. Therefore, the reason why Anglo-Soviet negotiations have been slow to achieve results is ultimately Britain's fault. As for the visit of Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin to Turkey, the result was extremely satisfactory. The two countries have already fully concluded an agreement. In addition, regarding the negotiations between Britain and Turkey, diplomatic sources here say that the negotiations have been successful. Turkey has agreed to participate in a collective security organization, which the Soviet Union has also endorsed.</p>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey: Well-informed sources here recently stated that Britain and Turkey have concluded an agreement to "guarantee peace in the Eastern Mediterranean." The full text of the agreement will be published simultaneously in the capitals of Britain and Turkey on the 8th of this month. All developments have been notified to the Soviet government at any time. (Havas, June 6)</p>
<p>(Paris) The day the Anglo-Turkish agreement on peace in the Eastern Mediterranean was concluded was also the day Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin returned from the Turkish capital. Well-informed sources here commented on this coincidence, saying that Turkey's joining the "Grand Alliance" is in fact endorsed by the Soviet Union, as can be seen from this. The Turkish authorities originally did not want to finalize the negotiations with Britain before the end of the talks among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Now, they have changed their approach and signed the agreement in advance, which must have been facilitated by Deputy Commissar Potemkin. The Soviet Union's unwillingness to pursue a policy of isolation can also be clearly demonstrated from this. (Havas, June 6)</p>
<p>(Paris) The agreement negotiated between Britain and Turkey has recently been concluded. The French government hopes to expand it into a tripartite consultation among Britain, France, and Turkey. However, due to the issue of the Sanjak region of the Syrian Republic, there are considerable difficulties. The Turkish authorities are demanding that the region be directly incorporated into Turkey, while according to the 1938 Franco-Turkish agreement, the region should be jointly administered by France and Turkey. However, those in charge of this matter still claim that it should not be difficult to find a satisfactory solution. It is said that France and Turkey are both satisfied. (Havas, June 6)</p>
<p>(London) Last night, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British Cabinet decided to submit a memorandum to the Soviet Union, stating that Britain cannot currently accept the Soviet proposal to conclude a military alliance with France and the Soviet Union. British Foreign Secretary Halifax immediately telegraphed this memorandum to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, to notify the Soviet Foreign Ministry. It is claimed that the British memorandum clearly states the reasons why Britain cannot currently accept the Soviet plan. Therefore, in theory, it does not block the door to the conclusion of a military alliance between Britain and the Soviet Union. The British government is waiting for the Soviet Union's reply with great urgency, in order to ascertain whether there has been any change in the Soviet Union's foreign policy since Litvinov's dismissal. It is claimed that the British memorandum to the Soviet Union clearly states that if Britain were to immediately conclude a direct military alliance with the Soviet Union, it might affect Britain's relations with Japan, and might also provoke a reaction from anti-communist countries in Europe. However, the British counterproposal stipulates that the Soviet Union's assistance to invaded countries is limited to after Britain and France have already dispatched troops, in order to avoid the Soviet Union being fooled by Britain and France. (Associated Press, June 6)</p>
<p>(London) Diplomatic sources here generally believe that the British government's intention is that Litvinov's removal from office does not mean that the Soviet Union has changed its foreign policy. Otherwise, it would not have submitted another note to the Soviet government. The content of this note has not been disclosed by official sources. According to informed sources, the British government has stated that Poland and Romania are unwilling to openly establish ties with the Soviet Union, lest Germany consider it a provocative move. Therefore, the British government cannot endorse the proposal for a tripartite alliance among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. (Havas, June 5)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky this morning and held talks. According to well-informed sources, the British counterproposal on the issue of collective security has not yet been sent to the Soviet government, but it will be sent to Sir Seeds, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, within a short time. According to reliable sources, the Anglo-Turkish agreement has in fact been concluded, but the government will not formally announce it until negotiations with other countries, including the Soviet government, have been completed. (Havas, June 6)</p>
<p>(London) Political figures here recently stated that the Soviet Union's former People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, had proposed that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union conclude an alliance treaty, but this has been rejected by the British government. It is noteworthy that Soviet dictator Stalin may therefore pursue a "policy of isolation." Well-informed sources here say that the British government, while hoping that the Soviet Union will come to the aid of its neighboring countries when Britain and France send troops to assist them, does not want to conclude a general reciprocal alliance treaty with it, and still insists on this position. (Havas, June 6)</p>
<p>(London) British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied in writing to a question from a member of parliament yesterday, stating that the British government does not intend to conclude non-aggression pacts with the Baltic states, namely Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, at present. (Haitong, June 6)</p>
<h3>Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Leaves Turkey for Home</h3>
<p>Stopover in Sofia for a Brief Stay</p>
<p>Sofia, Bulgaria: Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin departed from the Turkish capital last night to return home. He is expected to arrive here at 2:30 pm tomorrow. He will then proceed to the Romanian capital that evening before returning to Moscow. It is reported that Potemkin originally planned to stay here for two days, but the itinerary has been shortened, presumably due to the resignation of the country's People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov. (Havas, June 6)</p>
<h3>German and Italian Foreign Ministers Begin Talks</h3>
<p>Milan: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived here at 10:55 this morning. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano greeted him at the train station platform, and they drove together to Ribbentrop's hotel. The streets they passed were filled with flags. (Reuters, June 6)</p>
<p>Milan: The German and Italian foreign ministers began talks in the afternoon. It is generally understood that the main topic of discussion is the Polish issue. Germany is eager to know what Italy's attitude will be in the event of a future conflict between Germany and Poland. So far, Italy has only published articles in semi-official newspapers advising the Polish authorities to negotiate with Germany. Observers say that the Polish issue is different from the Sudeten issue, because Italy has always had close relations with Poland, and the Italian government believes that maintaining an independent and free Poland is essential to maintaining the balance of power in Europe. Moreover, Poland's attitude is sufficient to influence the attitudes of Romania and Yugoslavia, which Italy naturally values. In addition, there are still reports that the German and Italian foreign ministers intend to discuss the proposal to transform the "Rome-Berlin Axis" into a military alliance treaty. (Havas, June 6)</p>
<h3>Germany Actively Engages in Political Activities: Lobbies Small Countries to Enhance Its Position; Sends Amorous Glances to the Soviet Union; Attempts to Shatter Britain's Policy of Encirclement</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Last night in Berlin, attention was focused not on Foreign Minister Beck's speech, but on the political activities of the Foreign Ministry on Wilhelmstrasse. The Foreign Ministry is currently engaged in European political activities on many fronts, the reaction to which is sufficient to shatter Britain's policy of encirclement. Germany's entire foreign policy is almost entirely directed against Britain, which is becoming increasingly clear. Informed sources admit that Germany's foreign policy may be adjusted to promote this goal. The success of Germany's negotiations with Latvia and Estonia to conclude non-aggression pacts is given great significance here. Germany's non-aggression pacts will be extended to other countries, as some small countries now understand that aligning themselves with democratic countries is a dangerous path to war. Regarding rumors that Germany has begun negotiations with Greece to conclude a non-aggression pact, sources here believe that there is no basis for this, as Greece is a Mediterranean country, which is not in Germany's sphere of political influence. (Haitong, June 6)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Well-informed sources here attach great importance to Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Italy for talks with Foreign Minister Ciano. It is reported that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived in Milan at 11:00 this morning and will proceed to Cernobbio on the western shore of Lake Como to prepare for talks with Foreign Minister Ciano at the Villa d'Este there tomorrow. When the German and Italian foreign ministers hold talks, they will review the relationship between the Axis countries and the Soviet Union. Official sources here refused to comment on this. It is noteworthy that the *Hamburger Fremdenblatt* published a commentary hinting that the ideological conflict between the Axis countries and the Soviet Union might end after Litvinov's dismissal. The victory in Spain has made the Bolshevik country give up the idea of ​​linking up with democratic countries. The new turn of events is welcomed by German figures. From now on, Germany's peaceful goals can be contrasted with the peaceful goals of the democratic countries. The newspaper concluded its commentary by saying that the Soviet Union's future policy may be to remain isolated, or it should reach a compromise with Germany. (Haitong, June 6)</p>
<h3>Estonia Agrees in Principle to a Non-Aggression Pact with Germany</h3>
<p>Tallinn, Estonia: The proposal from the German government to conclude a non-aggression treaty has been approved in principle by the State Council. In addition, Latvian Foreign Minister Munters is scheduled to come here tomorrow to hold talks with government authorities. (Havas, June 5)</p>

<h3>Litvinov to Study Foreign Literature</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to Berlin's *Tägliche Rundschau*, former Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov, after retiring on a pension, plans to specialize in foreign literature at the Soviet National Library. (Haitong, June 6)</p>
<h3>Germany Twice Tempted Poland to Jointly Attack Russia: And Divide Its Territory; But Poland Refused</h3>
<p>(Paris) The moderate *L'Ordre*, the Radical-Socialist *L'Ère Nouvelle*, and the right-wing *Le Figaro* all claim that German Head of State Hitler suggested to Poland in March of this year that they jointly attack the Soviet Union and divide its territory. *L'Ère Nouvelle* also states that the Soviet Ukraine and the Transcaucasian republics were intended to be ceded to Germany, while the Little Russian Republic and the Baltic coastal areas would go to Poland. *Le Figaro* also said that when German Aviation Minister General Göring visited the Białowieża Forest in Poland and went hunting with Polish authorities, he was instructed to present this proposal. (Havas, June 6)</p>
<p>Warsaw: After a certain newspaper in Paris revealed the matter of German Head of State Hitler's two proposals to Poland to jointly attack the Soviet Union, well-informed sources here recently confirmed it. The first proposal was made in February of last year when German Aviation Minister General Göring came here for a visit. The second proposal was suggested by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to Foreign Minister Beck in January of this year. In both proposals, Germany agreed to cede the Ukrainian province, the Russian province, and part of the land of Lithuania to Poland after defeating the Soviet Union. However, it was rejected by Foreign Minister Beck. After General Göring returned to his country from here in January of last year, the dispute between Poland and Lithuania arose, but fortunately, it did not escalate into an armed conflict. Instead, the two sides restored diplomatic relations, and they have become friends from being enemies. To this day, there is even talk of concluding an alliance treaty. (Havas, June 6)</p>
<h3>Romania Particularly Concerned About Future Soviet Policy</h3>
<p>Bucharest: Sources in Bucharest say that Foreign Minister Beck's remarks were firm and dignified, without any accusatory tone, so the door to discussing the issue of Danzig and the corridor on the basis of equality between Germany and Poland has not been closed. However, the issue of future Soviet policy is more important than Beck's remarks. Forty-eight hours have passed since the news of Foreign Minister Litvinov's resignation was announced, but the Soviet Union has not yet made a statement on its future policy. This is significant. It is believed that if Stalin's views are broadly in line with Litvinov's policy, or if he wants to make slight changes to Litvinov's policy in detail, then Moscow should have already issued a statement at this time. (Reuters, June 5)</p>
<h3>Poland and Lithuania Turn Enemies into Friends: Possibility of Concluding an Alliance Treaty</h3>
<p>Warsaw: The army newspaper *Polska Zbrojna* recently published an article today hinting at the possibility of Poland and Lithuania concluding an alliance treaty. It stated: "Although Lithuania is a small country, we can regard it as a very reliable ally. The relations between Poland and Lithuania have become increasingly harmonious recently. Lithuania has realized that Poland is its natural ally." It is reported that Lithuanian Commander-in-Chief of the Army General Raštikis is scheduled to come here for a visit on the 8th of this month. Furthermore, when the German government recently proposed to conclude non-aggression agreements with the Nordic countries, it did not inquire about Lithuania. (Havas, June 6)</p>
<h3>British Government Recognizes the Independence of Slovakia</h3>
<p>(London) Britain has decided to recognize Slovakia de facto. Reuters has learned that the British Consulate in Bratislava has agreed to Estus, and has been appointed as Consul to Bratislava.

(Reuters, June 5) It is reported that Slovakia became a German protectorate as a result of Hitler's violation of the Munich Agreement and the partition of Czechoslovakia.</p>
<h3>Southern Regent Scheduled to Visit Rome</h3>
<p>(Rome) Prince Paul, the Regent of Yugoslavia, is scheduled to visit here in mid-month. At that time, the Italian government will hold naval exercises off the coast of Naples and invite him to attend.

<h3>The British King and Queen Embark on a Tour of Canada: Cheering Crowds Along the Route; The White House to Host a Grand Welcome for the Distinguished Guests</h3>
<p>(London) The British King and Queen and the two princesses left Buckingham Palace at 12:18 this afternoon in a four-horse drawn carriage and headed for Waterloo Station. The King, wearing a naval uniform, frequently raised his hand to thank the cheering crowds. The Queen and the two princesses were all dressed in light blue. Behind the royal carriage were several open carriages carrying the entourage. Fifteen minutes later, they arrived at the station. The vehicles of the King and others slowly drove into the station, allowing the crowds who had been waiting for several hours to catch a glimpse of the King and others. Under the glass roof of the station platform were hung the flags of the various dominions and colonies, as well as the American flag. Prime Minister Chamberlain and other cabinet members were at the station to see them off. At 2:10 pm, they arrived in Portsmouth, where the streets were also filled with flags and cheering crowds. The King and his party then boarded the HMCS Empress of Australia and set sail for Canada at 3:00 pm amidst the strains of military music. (Reuters, June 6)</p>
<p>(Washington) Concerns here about the visit of the British King and Queen to the United States are growing. Newspapers are filled with news from Britain and Canada. The public will eagerly study the photos of the Queen, as they will be the standard for American fashion in the future. It is reported that when the King and Queen visit Washington, they will formally meet with the US President and his wife, members of the cabinet, the diplomatic corps, and members of Congress. During their stay in Washington, the King and Queen will reside at the White House as guests of the President and his wife.

<h3>Accusing Germany of Unilaterally Abrogating the Treaty: Polish Reply Published; Anglo-Polish Agreement Purely Defensive in Nature; Germany's Arguments are Without Merit</h3>
<p>Warsaw: After the German government submitted a note on the 28th of last month, declaring the abrogation of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of January 26, 1934, the Polish government has responded with a memorandum. The content is summarized as follows: The reasons given by the German side are that the mutual guarantees between Britain and Poland are in conflict with the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, but no facts are cited as the basis. If the German government is willing to negotiate, the Polish government is also prepared to sign a treaty with it in the spirit of good neighborliness to resolve mutual relations. Poland is willing to accept any suggestions that Germany may put forward, provided that they respect the views listed in this memorandum. The memorandum begins by stating that the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 was based on the following two principles: (1) Both parties undertake not to use force against each other; (2) All disputes should be resolved by the parties through free negotiations and in a friendly manner. The Polish government anticipated many years ago that the issue of the Free City of Danzig would inevitably cause disputes, and therefore, in good faith, was willing to negotiate with the German government. Germany evaded the matter, merely saying that the relations between the two countries would not be harmed by the issue of Danzig. Head of State Hitler also gave a speech on January 30 of last year, stating that he was willing to respect Poland's interests in the city of Danzig. After the Czech incident occurred in September of last year, the German government began to suggest to Poland that talks should be held on the Danzig issue and the construction of a railway and highway through the corridor. The Polish government did not refuse. As for the note submitted by Germany on April 28 of this year, none of the requirements in it are acceptable to Poland. It is recalled that Poland submitted a note to Germany on March 26 of this year, stating that it was willing to maintain friendly relations with Germany, and was willing to jointly guarantee the city of Danzig, so that the residents of the city could live and work in peace, and the rights and interests held by Poland could also be respected. In addition, various measures that would facilitate railway and highway traffic between Germany's Pomerania Province and East Prussia are willing to be studied, but on the condition that the land through which this route passes remains under Polish sovereignty. This move is in line with the spirit of the 1934 Non-Aggression Pact. However, after one month, no answer was received. It was not until Head of State Hitler gave a speech on April 28 that it was learned that this counterproposal was deemed to be a refusal to negotiate. Yet it is known that what Germany put forward was a unilateral demand, which is in conflict with Poland's national dignity and vital interests, and it is not convenient to answer it, and it cannot be considered to be in line with the spirit of the Non-Aggression Pact. As for the issue of the Slovak state, Germany argues that the independence of Slovakia should be jointly guaranteed by Poland, Germany, and Hungary. In fact, the German government never made this suggestion before Head of State Hitler's speech, and it is even more difficult to reconcile the idea of ​​placing the Slovak state under protection politically and militarily with the proposal of jointly guaranteeing it. The Polish government is not at liberty to make any statement. In addition, Germany's interpretation of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact is that Poland should relinquish its right to conclude political agreements with third countries, in other words, to give up its independent and autonomous foreign policy. How can Poland accept this? Germany's foreign policy in recent years has not bound itself with this kind of interpretation. What one does not want for oneself, how can one impose it on others? At the time when the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact was concluded, Germany had already recognized that the Franco-Polish alliance treaty was only defensive in nature and did not conflict with it. Now that the mutual guarantees between Britain and Poland are also defensive in nature and do not threaten Germany, why should it be considered to be in violation of the German-Polish Pact? In addition, the German-Polish Pact is based on the Kellogg-Briand Pact of August 27, 1928. Poland will only take action in accordance with the Anglo-Polish Pact when Germany threatens Britain, which also means violating the German-Polish Pact of the Paris Pact, and there will be no reason to give others an excuse. Based on the above, Germany's unilateral abrogation of the German-Polish Pact has no facts to rely on. The term of this treaty is ten years, and it will not expire until 1944, and it does not contain any provisions for unilateral abrogation. (Havas, June 5)</p>
<h3>Various Reactions to Foreign Minister Beck's Speech: Britain and France Acknowledge the Tone as Moderate and Firm, Germany Deeply Dissatisfied Due to Rejection of Proposal, Italy Advises Poland Not to Be Obstinate and Bring Trouble Upon Itself</h3>
<p>London</p>
<p>London is currently carefully studying Polish Foreign Minister Beck's speech. While the impression is generally positive, it is widely known that there has been no official statement yet. According to diplomatic circles, Beck's speech has both moderate and firm characteristics. The reaction of Germany is what diplomatic circles are currently focused on. However, the Chairman of the Danzig Senate, Greiser, and the leader of the Danzig National Socialist Party, Forster, are both at Hitler's villa, indicating that Germany's response will not be delayed for long. Recalling the events in Czechoslovakia, Greiser's presence in Berchtesgaden will have special significance. According to diplomatic circles, Beck's comments on the unilateral cancellation of the German-Polish non-aggression pact should serve as a warning to countries currently receiving German proposals to conclude similar non-aggression agreements. (Reuters dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(London) The speech delivered yesterday by Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck has been praised by all newspapers here. They all said that the door to negotiations between Germany and Poland is still open. The Times stated, "Foreign Minister Beck's wording is firm, but there is absolutely no intention of provocation. Regarding the relationship between Germany and Poland, it is undoubtedly possible to seek solutions through diplomatic channels. The key is for both parties to exercise reason calmly, and then there will be no problem in finding a solution to the Free City of Danzig issue. Conversely, if the two countries resort to war due to disputes, a small spark will inevitably ignite a prairie fire, and no one will be able to save it." The Daily Mail stated, "Whether French or British, almost no one wants to sacrifice their lives for the Danzig issue." The Manchester Guardian took a slightly different stance, issuing a warning and advocating for abandoning appeasement attempts. Its words stated, "If Germany is allowed to do what it wants, and Danzig is militarily controlled, becoming a base for German land, sea, and air forces, then the country will become the master of Poland, just as Germany occupied the Sudetenland in October of last year and then became the master of Czechoslovakia. This should be prevented. If there are still people talking about 'appeasement' at this point, it is tantamount to encouraging Germany to believe that there is no consistent support within Britain for a firm policy, and this alone is enough to increase the risk of war." (Havas dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>Paris</p>
<p>Those in Paris believe that Polish Foreign Minister Beck's speech in the lower house was moderate, firm, and statesmanlike. The section on Danzig can be seen as a rejection of German proposals, but the wording is such that no one can accuse it of being provocative. It is rumored that Italy is currently using its influence to seek a peaceful solution to the German-Polish issue. Therefore, the public now hopes that Germany will use this moderate language to peacefully resolve the issue. According to general opinion, the firmness of Polish Foreign Minister's speech, coupled with the new declaration from Britain and France pledging to help Poland resist aggression, should make Germany understand that democratic countries are not merely making empty promises. If Germany intends to use the same tactics against the Baltic region as it did against Czechoslovakia, it will inevitably lead to a European war. (Reuters dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>Washington</p>
<p>Authoritative figures in Washington have a very good impression of Foreign Minister Beck's speech. Although Beck's response to Hitler yesterday did not close the door to reconciliation, it is believed here that this speech is sufficient to express Poland's consistent and strong national sovereignty and is consistent with its recent near-war state. The government stated that the final confirmation of relations between Germany and Poland here cannot be based solely on verbal statements and should be determined by the actions of the two countries. (Washington) The general public here originally felt uneasy about the issue of the Free City of Danzig. However, after Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's speech in the House of Representatives today, they were greatly relieved. Diplomatic figures here also said that Foreign Minister Beck's words were firm, courageous, and appropriate, and that his agreement to conduct negotiations with Germany in a peaceful atmosphere and on the basis of absolute equality is completely in line with the feelings of the majority of Americans. The American view is that international issues cannot be resolved unless the authorities of all related countries truly intend to consolidate peace. At this point, the key to the problem lies in whether Germany intends to cooperate faithfully with other countries to maintain peace in Europe or whether it will continue to pursue policies under a threatening atmosphere. The speech delivered by Foreign Minister Beck today and the remarks made by French Prime Minister Daladier to the press yesterday have similar results through different methods. Both of them are based on the basic theory revealed by President Roosevelt, which is commendable. Since they have neither closed the door to negotiations nor urged German leader Hitler to abandon the means of intimidation through power, it can be seen that European countries have established a good foundation for a collective security system. Germany's strategy of using propaganda to alienate countries will undoubtedly fail. (Havas dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>Berlin</p>
<p>Regarding the speech delivered by Beck in parliament yesterday, authoritative figures here said that it was a purely negative rejection of the German proposal. Poland has resolutely rejected the proposal of Head of State Hitler to adjust relations between the two countries. In addition, the aggressive demands in Polish newspapers and the mobilization of Polish troops indicate that Poland is not prepared to resolve the German-Polish dispute peacefully. Authoritative figures here criticized Beck's speech on three points: (1) Beck did not announce the truth of the matter. It should be noted that Germany proposed to Poland several months ago. In January of this year, when Beck met Hitler in Teschen and later met Ribbentrop in Munich, he made this proposal, not only after Mr. Xi delivered a speech recently. (2) Beck did not explain Poland's measures, that is, Beck avoided mentioning the mobilization of Polish troops and the upsurge of the anti-German movement. (3) Beck's reasons for rejecting the proposal are insufficient. Regarding the Danzig issue, Beck stated that Poland cannot abandon Danzig because the port is Poland's only port for exporting goods. It should be noted that Hitler has already acknowledged this and proposed a free zone to solve it in his proposal. Why didn't Beck's speech mention this proposal? Regarding the road construction issue in the Polish Corridor, Beck said that most of the residents in the area are Poles. In fact, since 1919, the number of Germans in the area has increased to one million. In short, authoritative figures in Berlin believe that the Polish Foreign Minister's speech has failed to alleviate the existing tensions and has not opened up new doors for negotiations. (Haitong dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>Rome</p>
<p>The Italian newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia published a critique by Guido about Polish Foreign Minister Beck's speech, warning Poland not to adopt an excessive anti-German stance and advising Poland to consider its own interests and not be exploited by other countries. It also stated that the solution to the problem of Teschen and the common Polish-Hungarian border, which benefited Poland, depended on Mussolini's intervention and Italy's actions. Poland should not forget this. (Reuters dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Piccolo newspaper reported today that Italy wants Germany and Poland to express moderation equally. Because only when all parties abandon the desire to establish hegemony can the path of justice be reached. Now that both parties have declared peace, they have already half reached a compromise.

<h3>The Issue of the Tripartite Military Alliance: The Opposition in Japan Is Gradually Gaining Ground, London Believes That There Is Hope for Improving Relations Between Britain and Japan, Arita Uses "Benevolent Rule" as a Gimmick to Deceive the Powers</h3>
<p>(London) British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, held talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita yesterday. Although the details are unknown, well-informed sources here claim that the situation is quite good. The faction in Japan that does not want to change the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance is gradually gaining ground, so there is great hope for improving relations between Britain and Japan. (Havas dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(New York) Regarding the relationship between Japan, Germany, and Italy, the New York newspaper Minsheng Bao recently commented on it with the title "Frustration and Tyranny." It stated that Japan's rejection of Germany and Italy's proposal to change the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance agreement "is certainly welcomed by the world, but the cabinet's decision to do so is actually contrary to the military authorities stationed in China and the powerful forces within the country who support the military alliance. After suffering repeated setbacks in China, the former faction has taken the risk. The leader of the latter faction, General Oshima, the ambassador to Germany, will certainly be dissatisfied with this decision. Therefore, unless those who support Japan as its backing overthrow the current cabinet to save face, General Oshima will not be at ease in his position. In addition, the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai are preparing to create a highly explosive situation in order to drive their government to conclude a military alliance treaty with Germany and Italy. The spokesperson of the Japanese army there made a statement on the 2nd of this month, stating that if the Japanese army had not protected the Shanghai International Settlement in 1937 (when the August 13th Shanghai War broke out), it would have ceased to exist long ago. This statement is a strong hint, indicating that it is not difficult for irresponsible elements to cause incidents. It is hoped that these impatient elements can be a little less impetuous, so that with the passage of time, their minds may become a little calmer, or they can find a safer way to preserve their face during the slow progress of diplomatic negotiations, which is a good plan." (Havas dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita said at the general meeting of the Federation of International Affairs last night that the important point of Japan's policy is completely based on the fundamental moral principle of making China and Manchuria live together in satisfaction and peace. Arita mentioned Japan's relationship with Germany and Italy, saying that the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact is the axis of Japan's foreign policy. This is Japan's unwavering policy, so Japan earnestly hopes that Germany and Italy, the signatories of the pact, will achieve common development in accordance with their respective national policies. Japan's relations with Germany and Italy are increasingly strengthened in both cultural and economic aspects. Manchuria, Hungary, and Spain have successively joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, so there are now six countries that have signed the pact. The current situation in the world seems to force the strengthening of the Anti-Comintern Pact, and several other countries are expected to join soon. Spain was once in danger of becoming communist, but fortunately, it was spared due to its spirit of anti-communism. This point is worth noting. The destructive activities of the Communist Party in China have increased rather than decreased and have become a major cause of the China Incident, forcing Japan to conclude the Anti-Comintern Pact. Japan's ultimate goal is to establish a new order in East Asia in accordance with the fundamental moral principle of "Benevolent Rule" and along the lines of its independent policy. The so-called "Benevolent Rule" is unique to Japan and is completely different from totalitarianism or democracy. Japan is now following the lines of its independent policy and the spirit of the Anti-Comintern Pact and is striving to promote the peace and prosperity of East Asia. The purpose of Japan's policy is to cooperate with various countries in the East to seek the prosperity of each country and world peace based on moral principles. Japan is now working to elevate China from its current "semi-colonial situation" to the position of a complete and independent country based on moral principles. Foreign countries seem to fear that the economic activities of third countries in China will be excluded by Japan's fundamental policy, but this kind of fear is useless. Japan has no intention of excluding foreign interests, and in fact, this kind of step is indeed impossible. (Reuters on the 5th)</p>
<h3>The Pope Cares About European Peace</h3>
<p>The pope is exerting efforts to mediate the conflict between Germany and Poland.</p>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Bonnet reported at the cabinet meeting this morning on the Pope's efforts to maintain European peace, because Bonnet met with the Vatican's envoy to France, Rensiwo, yesterday. (Reuters dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to semi-official sources today, the Pope is trying to find a peaceful solution to the Poland-Germany issues. If both Germany and Poland express their welcoming, then the Pope will mediate the Poland-Germany problems in a friendly manner. The Vatican's envoy to Germany, Orsenigo, recently visited Mr. Xi, although this action relates to the European conflicts, semi-official personnel thinks that Orsenigo was once for the Germany-Poland issues.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Invade Heshan in Three Routes</h3>
<p>Japanese planes bomb Heshan City, which has become scorched earth. Japanese troops also attack Gaoming from the north of Heshan, vainly hoping to encircle Zhaoqing with a roundabout strategy.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The Japanese army has recently made major reinforcements. The reinforcements from Taiwan have just arrived in Guangzhou and have been divided into Zengcheng and Fuhexu in Dongjiang to guard the outer perimeter of Guangzhou above Shitan. A part of them rushed to Jiangcun in Beijiang. At the same time, the Japanese troops in Foshan were also ordered to open to Sanshui Mian, etc. nearby. The trains traveling north and west from Guangzhou have been very busy transporting supplies for days. In addition, a large part of the Japanese army concentrated in Rongqi Guizhou, Shunde, with four or five thousand people, used hundreds of motorboats to cross the river to the west bank from the inland river, dividing into three routes to attack Heshan County, with the goal of the county seat. The assembly of each unit was completed before April 25, and the invasion began on the 26th. One route crossed the river from Jiujiang Heqing, Nanhai, and attacked Gulao, Heshan. One route went west from Xinhui, occupied Duruan Pingling, and attacked the eastern suburbs of Heshan. One route went around Danshuikou, which belonged to Kaiping, and detoured north to peek at the south of Heshan City. Among the three routes, the Danshuikou route had the least troops. Once they landed in Danshuikou, they were defeated by the Chinese army on the front line in Kaiping. The Xinhui Duruan route had more troops, but it was controlled by the Xinhui Heshan Road Chinese army and was difficult to advance. As for the Japanese army that advanced southward from Jiujiang to Gulao to meet Shaping and attack Heshan City, it seemed to be the main force, with no less than 5,000 people. Once the Japanese army's deployment was set, they used the trick of feinting east and attacking west, using some motorboats to carry marines to attack Danshuikou as a restraint, and then using most of the troops to advance westward along the Pingling Duruan of Xinhui Heshan Road. The Chinese regular army, believing that the Pingling area was the outer line to defend Heshan, had to deploy considerable troops there. When the Japanese troops in Pingling moved on the 27th, the Chinese artillery exerted its power and switched to the offensive. In the morning of the 27th, the two sides were extremely engaged, and at 2 pm, three artillery fortresses of the Japanese army in Pingling were blown up, and Pingling was captured, heading straight to Jinggen Duruan, which was about to approach Xinhui City. The Japanese army used multiple planes to support them and bombarded the advancing Chinese troops. Because the Chinese army had no fortifications to defend, they automatically withdrew to the east of Pingling to block the Japanese army's westward advance after annihilating hundreds of Japanese troops.</p>
<p>When the Japanese army invaded Heshan City in three routes, when the Danshuikou and Xinhui Heshan Road routes were moving, the Japanese army in the Jiujiang Heqing area also crossed the river at the same time and captured Gulao and Shaping in Heshan, and passed Longkouxu to attack the back of Heshan City. At that time, the local militia was outnumbered and had to move to a new position after fierce fighting. Japanese planes continued to bomb the rear of Heshan, and the Chinese army withdrew from the suburbs and waited for reinforcements. On the 28th, the two sides fought a bloody battle with the Japanese army in Jingang and other places in Longkou Township in the north of the city. At that time, the Chinese army had arrived from Gaoming and other places to join the counterattack, and a part of them detoured Kunlun Mountain and attacked the Japanese army from the side. The gains and losses of the above strongholds were determined several times, and after a day and night of hardship, the Japanese army in Heshan City was defeated in the morning of the 29th. 3,000 Japanese troops suffered heavy losses in Jingang, with 600 to 700 casualties. The rest fled back to Heqing Jiujiang. As for a part of the Japanese army that detoured from Shaping, it was intercepted by the Chinese army after crossing Shaping five miles, and more than 100 cavalry were lost. The Chinese army captured a large cannon and retreated in embarrassment to Haikou. Heshan City was devastated after being ravaged by the Japanese army. The central area of the city was bombarded by 40 to 50 giant bombs dropped by Japanese planes, and the bombed areas have become mounds. The suffering of the county people is countless. The refugees fled out of the city, wandering and starving, in a very miserable state.</p>
<p>After Heshan City was recovered by the Chinese army on the 29th, the Japanese army's ambition was still not suppressed. They continued to transfer teams from Jiujiang and Shunde to reinforce them. According to reports, the Japanese army has a momentum to come back. It plans to have the Japanese army on Xinhui Heshan Road take the main attack, and launch a fierce attack on the east of Heshan City from Pingling Duruan. It will also increase troops to go north along the He Kai Highway from Danshuikou to attack the south of Heshan City. At the same time, thousands of people took the road to Gulao, peeped at Sanzhou, and invaded the border of Gaoming County, attempting to encircle Zhaoqing along the Yaoming Highway. This move is worth noting, because if the Japanese army in this area succeeds in the roundabout, the Chinese army on the east and west banks of the Xijiang will be greatly threatened. In recent days, the Chinese army has stepped up fortifications on this line and transferred thousands of strong men from Guangxi to the front line to assist in the attack and defense. The Yaoming Highway has been completely destroyed from Sanzhou to the north, and it will not be easy for the Japanese army to fly over it.</p>
<h3>Changsha Residents Evacuate Westward for the Second Time</h3>
<p>The authorities are deploying to defend against the Japanese army's invasion, and relief work is still ongoing.</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, Pastor Tyne of the American Church in Changsha, accompanied by his wife, who is about to return to the United States, toured western China and later came to Shanghai. Yesterday (the 5th), he told reporters that Changsha is now in terror again. The transportation lines leading into the city from the north and east have been cut off by the military authorities to prevent a possible Japanese invasion. When Pastor Tyne left the Changsha Church in mid-April, the political and civilian circles were quite concerned about the intentions of the Japanese army in central China. Ordered by the provincial government, the residents of Changsha have already begun their second evacuation westward since the fall, and every day, thousands of people, carrying their belongings, swarm out of the city, taking to the Xiang River south to Xiangtan, and then turning west into the Lian River to Xiangxiang, and then heading west. The roads leading into Changsha are already impassable. The rails of the Yue Han Road on the Yangtze River between Yueyang and Changsha have been completely removed from the roadbed. Although the railway north of Changsha has been destroyed, the railway south of Changsha still facilitates the people with excellent service. These trains run on time every day, carrying passengers from Changsha south to Hengyang and other places. A large number of goods are often carried back to Changsha by this train. Although there is good railway service, there is still a shortage of major goods in Changsha, such as soap and other sanitary products. Pastor Tyne's wife runs a small soap factory in the city, where refugees work to provide relief. Although it is difficult to obtain the necessary raw materials, the soap is sold out as soon as it is produced. Although the provincial government has ordered an evacuation, relief work is still ongoing, mostly carried out by the Changsha International Relief Committee. Tyne is the director of publicity for the committee. The committee's working funds come from the National Relief Association and the International Red Cross, among others. After the fire in November last year, the national government allocated 100,000 yuan to the committee to carry out the city's reconstruction work. Shortly before the Tyne couple left Changsha on April 7, the city suffered its first air raid after the great fire. Although there were only two Japanese planes carrying out this destructive mission, the temporary houses built around the church were bombed into rubble. One bomb was thrown into the church, less than an arrow's distance from Tyne's residence. Fortunately, no one was injured. The two of them took a train from Changsha to Shaoguan and changed to a car east to Shantou. The roads in Guangdong Province also took similar precautions as the roads leading into Changsha. They took a coastal ship from Shantou to Shanghai. Now Tyne has not yet decided where to go, but his wife is scheduled to return to her home in Boston within two months to meet her three children who are studying in the United States.</p>
<h3>Wang Dezhou, Leader of the Chedu Township Militia in Songjiang, is Assassinated</h3>
<p>The Murderer is Suspected to Be a Bandit</p>
<p>Songjiang Correspondence: Wang Dezhou, the leader of the Chedu Township Militia in the first district of the county, was spotted by a disciple of Wang Wenlong when he was passing through Sanlintang, Pudong, in the evening of the 5th. So he and a few accomplices followed him. When they reached a quiet area, they shot Wang to death. Fearing that the incident would be leaked, the disciples threw Wang's body into the river. According to those familiar with Wang's background, Wang was originally from Sichuan and had served in the military and political circles for many years. Since 1935, he had lived in Chedu Township, married a woman from the Gu family in the township, and opened a South China goods store to make a living. Since the Japanese army occupied Song City, Wang continued to operate his business. Later, because the local area was unstable and bandits continued to run rampant, kidnapping occurred from time to time. Wang's store was robbed several times. Out of anger, he organized a militia to protect the local area, which was hated by the bandits. Therefore, he encountered this unfortunate incident.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles in the Border Areas of Pinghu, Shan, and Songjiang Counties</h3>
<p>The Japanese army was lured to death and injury in large numbers, and the heads of the propaganda class and teams were killed in battle.</p>
<p>Pinghu Correspondence: The Japanese army, entrenched in the four places of Songshan Fengping, led by the traitorous road protection committee members, set out by land and water to attack the Chinese army. When they arrived at Chaonitan Town, which belonged to Songjiang County, the 　　　 division of the Chinese army, together with the 　　　 brigade Tian Tuan, used a small number of troops to lure them deep. When they arrived at Wutongmiao Town, they surrounded them on all sides and fierce battles broke out. The Japanese army in Songjiang, hearing the news, urgently sent reinforcements to Xintai to join the battle. For three days and three nights, a Japanese motorboat loaded with bullets was blown up in the Chaonitan area by the Chinese army. The Japanese army could not resist due to the depletion of bullets. Fujiwara, the head of the Japanese propaganda class in Jiashan, and Moriya, the captain of the Japanese squad in Songjiang, were killed in battle. Several other Japanese officers of the same rank were also missing. The Japanese army in Jiashan Fengjing was almost completely wiped out, with only four or five survivors. The 　　division of the Chinese army captured 78 soldiers from Songjiang. The Japanese army stationed in Xintai Town also suffered heavy casualties. The newly appeared puppet maintenance association chairman in the town was also beheaded by the Chinese army. At the same time, the Chinese army in Wutongmiao Town lured the Japanese army to Datongqiao Town, and street battles broke out in the town. As a result, people could not escape, and hundreds of people were killed and injured. The houses and shops in the town were reduced to ashes. The villages three or four miles away from the town, as well as Wutongmiao Town, suffered the same disaster. In addition, the Japanese army abandoned countless military supplies, and the bodies of Japanese soldiers could not be transported away. The Japanese army was furious and lured the traitors among the road protection teams with heavy money to guide them in searching the suburbs and killing innocent civilians to vent their anger.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou National Goods Store Manager, Zhu Fusheng Arrested for Tearing Down Slogans</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Zhu Fusheng, manager of the National Goods Store in this city, is 52 years old. After Hangzhou fell, he took his family to seek refuge elsewhere. Later, due to livelihood issues, he hurriedly returned to Hangzhou in the autumn to resume his old business. However, he was very dissatisfied with the puppet government's measures and had scolded them several times, but the puppet authorities had no evidence and did not punish him. On the 1st of this month, the puppet "Great People's Assembly" posted absurd slogans everywhere on the main streets. The walls of the National Goods Store were also plastered with them. Zhu happened to see them and personally tore them down. This was seen by the puppet police there, who, without asking the reason, arrested Zhu and detained him in the puppet police station. Initially, he was not allowed to meet friends or relatives. Later, after Zhu's wife went around to plead, family members were allowed to visit. It is said that in the detention center, Zhu's hands were handcuffed, his feet were shackled, and his body was covered with wounds, so that he could not sit or stand. His wife, seeing this, could not help but weep, and was driven out by the puppet police. But Zhu remained calm and gave his wife a stirring speech, roughly saying, "I am now over fifty, what is there to regret about death? I only ask that you command our children not to forget the nation, not to forget for whom I am dying," and so on. His wife, hearing these words, wanted to offer comfort but was quickly pushed out the door. Subsequently, his wife asked someone to intervene, spending a large sum of money to secure his release. After Zhu was released, he learned of the intervention and scolded his entire family endlessly, saying it was wrong.</p>

<h3>Rice Market Resumes Business Yesterday, Trading According to Price Limits, Most Hoarders Dump Stock, Market Stabilized, Strict Supervision Enforced to Prevent Backroom Manipulation</h3>
<p>Shanghai Market Has Ample Rice Stocks, Over 800,000 Bags</p>
<p>The rice price in this city, after a joint meeting of seven rice industry groups, was allowed to be raised to 15 yuan due to source obstacles and heavy taxes. The market resumed yesterday morning, and all brokers traded according to the limit. The market also sent inspectors to the venue to pay attention to manipulation and backroom deals, so as to strictly enforce the rules. Rice industry representatives are scheduled to visit the Concession authorities tomorrow to report on the change in rice prices and actively encourage brokers and merchants to clear the source. When necessary, each group will plan to stabilize rice prices to maintain the people's food supply. The details of each situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Public Announcement of Price Limit</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association posted a public notice at the market, stating, "Regarding the public notice, the Association convened a joint meeting of various rice industry groups on the 5th of this month, including rice shops, rice milling industry, Changshu Rice Industry Association, Nanbang Association, rice retailers, and rice transport merchants' association, to jointly discuss how to handle the recent high rice prices, which have far exceeded the limit. It was resolved (omission in the middle)... Considering the situation, the highest price for white japonica rice and Yangxian rice is set at 15 yuan per dan, and the highest price for Kexian rice is set at 14 yuan per dan. Each rice must be strictly graded to take care of the people's livelihood. For goods traded before today, if the price is above 15 yuan, the settlement should also be made at 15 yuan per dan. No return of tickets is allowed for traded rice," and so on. The record is on file. The case is recorded urgently and announced, so that all brokers must abide by it. This is hereby announced.</p>
<p>Market Reopens</p>
<p>After the Rice Market Management Committee was forced to suspend the market due to sudden and drastic changes in market transactions on the morning of the 5th, it immediately followed the resolution of the joint meeting of rice industry groups to relax the price limit, and reopened the market at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. All merchants and traders were able to stabilize their minds after the market was slightly relaxed and the penalty methods were determined. The number of transactions between buyers and sellers was balanced and orderly, and trading was conducted within the limit. The chaotic situation was swept away. From the opening to the closing of the market, the total transaction volume reached more than 11,000 bags, of which 60-70% were dumped by (hoarding households), and 20-30% were traded between merchants and traders.</p>
<p>Supervising Manipulation</p>
<p>In order to implement the penalty measures and stabilize the market, the Market Management Committee specifically appointed the original management committee members Gu Yisheng, Wang Tianqiu, Hu Bokang, and the trader representatives Shi Zufuku and Zhang Songtao to be responsible for inspection. They will pay attention to whether there are backroom transactions between merchants, between shops, or between peers, and whether peers with thicker capital are borrowing brokers from peers to absorb and manipulate large amounts. Once discovered, they will report to the management committee and strictly implement the penalty fees, without favoritism, in order to maintain public business and eliminate malpractices.</p>
<p>Letter Explaining Process</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Branch sent letters to the Public Concession Engineering Bureau, the French Concession Board of Directors, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating, "Respectfully, our Association convened a joint meeting of various rice industry groups on the 5th of this month to discuss how to handle the recent high rice prices in Shanghai, which have far exceeded the limit. It was resolved that the original price limit set by our Association, which should not exceed 14 yuan per dan for the highest quality white rice, was maintained by various rice industry groups for more than a year. However, recently, there have been many obstacles in the source of rice. For example, only five trucks of rice are transported from Wuxi to Shanghai every day, totaling 625 bags. Suzhou is limited to 40,000 bags per month. The price of rice in Changshu and other places is higher than that in Shanghai. Rice boats from Nanbang are blocked by the rice market ferry. Various places in the suburbs of Shanghai are purchasing from Shanghai. As for the Yangtze River area, the price of rice in Wuhu has risen, and taxes have been added. Nanjing cannot transport rice to Shanghai. The source is scarce, and the stock is gradually reduced, resulting in high prices, which have far exceeded the limit. Reported that the recent high-quality rice has risen to more than 15 yuan. If there is no restriction and no remedy for a long time, it will greatly affect the people's food supply. The joint meeting of various rice industry groups solemnly discussed that maintaining the limit is impossible due to the facts, and the production price in the inland is high and the taxes are heavy. Merchants have suffered a lot of losses, so they have to take care of it in order to increase the source (omission in the middle). The case is recorded and communicated, so I hope you will check and record it. The association is scheduled to send representatives to visit the authorities of the two concessions and the City Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow to detail the process of changing the rice price limit and inquire about the opinions of the authorities.</p>
<p>Ample Rice Stocks</p>
<p>Regarding the rice stocks in various silver money industries, pawnshops, and brokers in this city, according to the results of the four surveys by the Evaluation Committee, there are still more than 610,000 bags. However, according to sources, the total amount of rice in Shanghai is more than this number. Among them, it has fallen into the hands of private non-industry people, and the exact number cannot be investigated. The large one is always more than 800,000 bags, so there is no panic about the people's food supply. According to the reporter, the current Bean and Rice Industry Association Market Management Committee, in addition to sending letters to the industry in various producing areas to try to clear the source as much as possible, and mouth-neck persuade various brokers, although there are multiple obstacles in the inland, for the sake of the future of Shanghai citizens' food, increase the transport.</p>
<p>Difficulty in Stabilizing Prices</p>
<p>When the rice industry groups held a joint meeting on the 5th of this month, the Rice Shop Industry Association suggested that, in view of the soaring rice prices and the impact on the people's food supply, the prices should be stabilized to maintain the livelihood of the general public. A number of stabilization points will be set up in the two concessions, and the highest price will be limited per dan, and the daily sales volume will be limited. The losses of stabilizing the price will be subsidized by donations from high-quality rice. Before the meeting, the suggestion was exchanged privately, and it was considered that the current price of rice is high, and there is no sufficient and huge preparation for stabilizing the price of rice. The matter is very important and it is very difficult to realize, so it will be temporarily abandoned and considered again when it is necessary in the future.</p>
<h3>Hanging Flags in the Concessions, Japanese Consul Raises Objections</h3>
<p>Sends Note to the Authorities of the Two Concessions Demanding a Ban on Hanging the Chinese Flag</p>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reported that the Japanese Consul General Miura sent a strongly worded note to the French Consul General Baudez and the Director-General of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, Fan Keling, yesterday (the 5th), demanding a complete ban on hanging the Chinese flag in the Public Concession and the French Concession. According to a press release issued by the Japanese Consulate last night, Miura said that the authorities of the two concessions allowed the national flag to be hung for eight days a year, which was unacceptable. Miura also said that allowing the flag to be hung was tantamount to the administrative organs of the two foreign-controlled areas recognizing the power of a government that was far from Chongqing and had lost its jurisdiction. He also said that the foreign authorities agreed with the anti-Japanese sentiment of the Chinese people. His reason for demanding a ban on hanging the flag was that it was necessary to maintain peace and order in the Public Concession and the French Concession.</p>
<h3>Chief Inspector of the French Police, Cao Bingsheng, Assassinated Yesterday, Hit by Four Bullets in Vital Spots, Died in the Afternoon After Surgery Due to Inflammation</h3>
<p>Suspects Arrested, Stray Bullets Injured Three People</p>
<p>A bloody case occurred in the French Concession yesterday morning. The main figure in this bloody case was Cao Bingsheng, the Chinese Inspector of the Political Department of the French Police. He was shot by several thugs on the way. Cao was hit by three bullets and died at Guangci Hospital at 4:30 p.m. The detailed information of the case is recorded below.</p>
<p>Encountered Danger on the Way Out from Home</p>
<p>The incident occurred at around 7:50 a.m. yesterday. Cao was taking a chartered car from his residence at No. 5 Shuanglongfang, Lane 172, West Aichengs Road, Ladu Road, to the police station to work. Cao was wearing a Western suit, and his driver, A San, from Changzhou, was pulling the car forward. Unexpectedly, when he was about 20 houses away from his home, at the entrance of Dafu Noodle Restaurant at No. 162, four thugs suddenly jumped out from the roadside. They were all wearing short clothes. Two of them stepped forward to hold the car shafts so that they could not move forward. The other two dragged the car canopy from behind, and at the same time, they pulled out their pistols and fired at Cao.</p>
<p>Cao Hit by Four Bullets, Injured Pedestrians</p>
<p>Cao was caught off guard and was hit by four bullets. Two bullets hit the upper part of the left and right breasts, but did not pass through. One bullet grazed the skin on the right side of the neck, and one bullet hit the back of the neck, passed through the chest, and entered the lungs. Blood flowed like a fountain, and he fell to the ground wounded. Seeing this, the thugs were about to escape. One of them ran towards Ganshi East Road. The nearby patrolmen had already heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene. The Yue patrolman at No. 435 first pursued the thugs. The thugs also opened fire to resist arrest. There was a burst of gunfire, and the two sides fired more than 20 shots in total. As a result, Wang Tingsheng, a young man from Tianjin, was injured by a bullet. At the same time, two maids, Chen Zhangshi and Xu Shi, were injured by stray bullets.</p>
<p>Car Sent to Guangci Hospital for Emergency Treatment</p>
<p>When Cao fell to the ground in a pool of blood, the driver A San rushed back home to report to Cao's wife, Sun. She rushed to the scene, but there was no car line nearby, so she stopped a car passing by and sent Cao to Guangci Hospital. At the same time, the French police also received the news and immediately sent an ambulance and a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to rescue and capture. The pedestrians hit by stray bullets were sent to the hospital.</p>
<p>Bullets Entered Abdomen, Blood Transfusion, Surgery</p>
<p>After Cao was sent to Guangci Hospital, he was transferred to the No. 1 superior ward on the upper floor of the eastern part of the hospital, near the escalator. Important personnel of the French Police and the French Superintendent General Fabre all visited him in person. His relatives and friends also rushed to express their condolences. At 10:10 a.m., because Cao had lost too much blood, his family members gave him a blood transfusion of 500CC. Cao was very conscious, but the doctor said that the bullet that hit Cao's right shoulder on the back had passed through the lungs and entered the abdomen, and it was necessary to perform surgery to remove the bullet. The family members agreed, and at 11:05 a.m., Cao was carried to the operating room. X-rays were taken first, and the official operation was performed at 12:30 p.m. The process was quite good.</p>
<p>Died Untreatably, Funeral on the 8th</p>
<p>After the surgery, at about 2:00 p.m., Cao suddenly felt weak, exhausted, and had difficulty breathing. The doctor also said that his bullet wounds had injured his lungs and intestines, so he used oxygen to help him breathe. But in the end, due to inflammation in his body, his injuries changed dramatically, and he died at 4:30 p.m. Everyone was shocked to hear the news. Cao's body has been sent to the Shanghai Funeral Home, and a funeral committee has been set up. The funeral will be held at 1:00 p.m. on the 8th, and the funeral will be held at 2:00 p.m. Last night, the police also thoroughly investigated the case because Cao was killed, which was a major case, and instructed all detectives to pay attention to detecting and arresting the murderer in order to solve the case.</p>
<p>Pursuit of Murderers, Stray Bullets Injured People</p>
<p>When the Yue patrolmen were shooting and chasing the murderers, because the stray bullets were flying, Wang Tingsheng, a young man from Tianjin, and Chen Zhangshi and Xu Shi, a maid who bought vegetables, were injured. They were sent to the hospital by the police for treatment, and the injuries were not serious. When the Yue patrolmen and the murderers were fighting, Wang Shaokun (age 19, from Shandong, living at No. 22 Kuanyu Lane, Dongxin Bridge), an accomplice of the murderer, was hit by several bullets and fell to the ground injured. He was captured and taken to the police station for questioning. It is said that he has admitted to participating in the assassination of Cao. The police sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At the same time, the police sent out a passing detectives and notified the Public Police Station to investigate and arrest the fugitives and bring them to justice.</p>
<p>Impoverished After Death, Commentators Regret</p>
<p>Cao was a native of Wuxi, 30 years old, with a wife, Sun, 26 years old, and a daughter, Cici, who is now four years old. Cao was very amiable and knowledgeable. He was indeed a capable talent in the French Police. In the past, he served as a translator in the Political Department, and then he was promoted to inspector. After the August 13th Incident, he worked very hard to handle the relief of the refugee area, and his achievements were remarkable. He was specially promoted to medical inspector. However, he was always fair in handling affairs and did not accept favors from others, and he was also happy to do good deeds, so his salary was only enough to cover his expenses, so he had no savings. His relatives, friends, and colleagues all regretted him very much. It is said that a few months ago, a terrorist group from the puppet government once sent people to his lane to try to harm Cao, but fortunately it was detected in advance, and several criminals were caught.</p>
<p>Recently Received Two Warning Letters</p>
<p>It is certain that at a certain time last year, when the "Huangdao Society" was rampant in terrorist activities, the puppet government secretly sent terrorist bandits to Cao's residence near West Ai Xian Si Road to plot to assassinate Cao. At that time, the Prime Minister got the report in advance and captured several people on the spot. After the investigation, they confessed that they were instructed by the puppet government. However, the police did not publish it at that time, and Cao himself did not pay attention to it afterwards. Until recently, a month ago, Cao received two warning letters from a certain party in succession. Cao also ignored them. He did not expect that the disaster would happen at his elbow and he would eventually suffer a poisonous hand.</p>
<p>Police Superintendent General Weeps in Sorrow</p>
<p>After Cao died in the hospital, Mr. Fei Bai'er, the police superintendent general of the French Police, was extremely saddened and wept again and again. Mr. Fei said to people at the time that since the European War, Cao was the first person he had mourned so much that he shed tears with his colleagues. Cao was young, honest, and loyal to his duties. He was indeed one of the most promising police officers in the French Police in the future. Unfortunately, this tragic change has caused endless mourning. From this, it can be seen how deeply Cao was loved during his lifetime.</p>
<h3>Youth Association Launches Service for Poor Children</h3>
<p>Seek Land to Build Houses to Accommodate</p>
<p>The Christian Youth Association has launched a service for poor children because the number of homeless and vagrant children has increased dramatically after the war. Although various child welfare organizations have tried to provide relief, it is still difficult to achieve results. The purpose is to provide shelter for destitute children, provide food, clothing, and shelter, and provide education and various crafts, so that they can have a skill in the future and serve society. In terms of funding, they will raise funds themselves. Once a vacant lot is found, they will build houses and start accommodating and teaching.</p>

<h3>Silk Factories Shut Down Due to Exhaustion of Raw Materials, Spring Cocoons Begin to Enter the Market</h3>
<p>"Huazhong Company" Abandons Control of Township Cocoon Shops</p>
<p>Shanghai silk factories have successively shut down due to the exhaustion of raw materials. Spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have begun to enter the market. "Huazhong Company" has abandoned the control of township cocoon shops. Banks and money houses refuse to lend money, and insurance companies refuse to insure various risks. Manufacturers regard collecting cocoons in the occupied areas as a dangerous path. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Silk Factories Shut Down Due to Exhaustion of Raw Materials</p>
<p>After the war, silk manufacturers in the four suburbs of Shanghai, Wuxi, Jiaxing, and other places refused to cooperate with the Japanese and set up new factories in the Shanghai Concession area. By the end of April, 45 factories with more than 10,000 machines had completed construction and started operations. Among them, there was one factory specializing in reeling palace cocoons. Now, due to the exhaustion of raw dried cocoons, 15 factories have had to announce temporary shutdowns. The factories that are still running strongly will also shut down after the raw materials are reeled. It is expected that most of them will temporarily shut down before the end of this month and resume operations after the spring cocoons enter the market. Only one or two factories can connect with the spring cocoons.</p>
<p>Spring Cocoons in Various Places Begin to Enter the Market</p>
<p>The spring cocoons are listed earliest in Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, and the latest in Wuxi and Changzhou, Jiangsu Province. The local cocoons in Zhejiang Province will be listed around the 17th of this month, and the improved species will be listed one week later. The improved species in Jiangsu Province will be listed in early June. Shanghai silk factories originally planned to buy cocoons from the producing areas, but now, (1) banks and money houses have stopped lending money for cocoons, (2) insurance companies do not allow the insurance of military fires and theft risks, and (3) the occupied areas are unstable. Non-occupied areas such as Xiaoshao, etc., because the shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo is cut off, the collected cocoons cannot be transported to Shanghai, so each factory regards the collection of cocoons as a dangerous path.</p>
<p>Abandoning Control of Township Cocoon Shops</p>
<p>In addition to robbing silk factories in the occupied areas, Huazhong attempted to control the collection of cocoons and once handled the registration of cocoon shops. Now, because the cocoon shops in various places are located in the countryside and cities, there are no cocoon shops, and the townships are now controlled by guerrillas. According to the order, cocoon shops related to "Huazhong Company" will be destroyed. In Haining County, as many as 21 cocoon shops have been destroyed. Therefore, Huazhong Company has abandoned the control of cocoon shops in various townships except for the control of cocoon shops within the urban area, and allows manufacturers and surplus cocoon merchants to freely set up shops in various townships to collect cocoons.</p>
<p>Loans for Spring Cocoons in Eastern Zhejiang to Buy</p>
<p>Regarding Sheng County, Xinchang, Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, and other places in eastern Zhejiang, after the Zhejiang Province Government made efforts to increase the yield of spring cocoons, the breeding of spring silkworms this year has increased dramatically. Due to suitable weather in , it is expected that the harvest will be good. From the 17th, the spring cocoons will start to appear on the market. Now, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has agreed with the Zhejiang Local Bank to lend money to buy as much as possible. In order to relieve the livelihood of farmers, the central price of spring cocoons is stipulated, and cocoon shops in various places buy according to this price. The collected cocoons are sold to the Trade Commission and exported to Hong Kong and other places.</p>

<p>Although Foreign Ships Mostly Sail on Schedule, They Still Hesitate Temporarily and Feel Quite Difficult</p>
<p>The situation in eastern Zhejiang is still tense, with heavy troops stationed along the coast, and the guards are strict. Japanese ships are spying on various places from time to time.

The German-owned Moufu, originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou today, has been postponed again and again. Although it is scheduled to sail to Wenzhou on the 9th, whether it will sail at that time depends on whether there are any difficulties in the voyage.</p>
<p>Hana Has Sailed from Dinghai to Shanghai</p>
<p>The German-owned Far East Company's Hana, which decided to resume shipping to Dinghai, was detained in the sea off Dinghai. Although it has been released safely and arrived in Dinghai, it is said that the detention incident has not been resolved. The ship has sailed from Dinghai to Shanghai at 4:00 p.m. yesterday and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 8:00 a.m. this morning. However, the company believes that the detention incident has been resolved. The German-owned Haifu, which was approved to sail on the Shanghai-Dinghai route, originally planned to sail from Shanghai to Dinghai the day before yesterday. Now, because Hana was detained, it was decided to suspend the sailing and changed the route to the Shanghai-Wenzhou route, which has not yet been decided. It is currently berthed at the Shanghai Roosevelt Pier.</p>
<p>Ningbo-Dinghai Shipping Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>The shipping route between Dinghai and Ningbo was originally served by the German-owned Tianbao, the German-owned Lulin's Gaodeng, and the Portuguese-owned Zhengsui Company's Libao. Now, the above three ships have been detained by Japanese ships in the sea off Dinghai and forced to sail to Shanghai to berth. Therefore, the Ding-Yong route has had to be temporarily suspended. It is also said that when Gaodeng was detained, a tax official from a certain bureau in Ningbo was killed. As for the Shanghai-Ningbo route, except for oil tankers such as Asia, Mobil, and Texaco, passenger and cargo ships are all prohibited from sailing. The Italian-owned German Ping is also under surveillance by the Japanese and is temporarily berthed at the No. 20 pontoon in Yangshupu.</p>

The receiving agency in Shanghai was located at Room 43, North China Apartment, Malin Road, French Concession. The recipient used the alias Wang Muci to come forward. At noon on March 28th of this year, Ying ordered his employee, Shi Ying (27 years old, from Nanjing), to pick up 96 cans of canned food from the General Post Office. He was intercepted by customs officers stationed at the bureau, who opened the cans for inspection and found that 49 of the 96 cans were filled with opium, weighing 132 pounds. The opium was confiscated, and Shi was detained. He was transferred to the French Concession Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest Ying Dequan, but he had already fled after hearing the news. Shi was then sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution according to law, while Ying Dequan was wanted for arrest and prosecution. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Shi Ying's case has now been concluded by Judge Miao Qingbang of the Second Special Court.

<h3>Western Newspaper Expresses Views on the Inspection of Chinese Newspapers</h3>
<p>Expressing Sympathy for the Difficulties Faced by the Authorities; Finding it Difficult to Accept Undue Restrictions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury published an editorial yesterday titled "The Police and the Press," stating that the Commissioner-General of Police of the Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a rather strong letter to Chinese newspapers in Shanghai, regardless of their nationality, using clear and unambiguous language, resembling the implementation of censorship on certain news materials. The letter stated that "any article relating to the current hostile actions, political movements, or political groups, or containing speeches or pronouncements inciting violence, regardless of its source, must be submitted to the Special Branch of the Central Police Station for approval before publication." The letter also contained a significant statement: "Your paper must currently understand the reasons for such precautions," and stated that "failure to obtain prior approval before publication in accordance with the above instructions will result in the revocation of your paper's registration certificate and other actions taken as directed by the Municipal Council."</p>
<p>Legal Perspective</p>
<p>From a purely legal perspective, it is extremely questionable whether the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department has the right to inspect such publications or, in fact, interfere with their publication and sale, except for Shanghai foreign publications engaging in blatant provocation that can be brought to court under the laws of their respective nationalities. Even in cases where charges are brought, there is no reason under American law to take actions that effectively prohibit them.</p>
<p>For the Sake of Readers</p>
<p>On the other hand, during this period, we should show the greatest sympathy for the difficulties faced by the foreign authorities in both districts. As long as these authorities restrain themselves with reason, we will not want to be nitpicky or overly assertive of legal rights. We believe that other newspapers share this sentiment. If the authorities were to interfere with the proper publication of news or the faithful expression of editorial opinions, we would have to seriously consider other methods to fight against undue restrictions or rather suspend our Chinese edition rather than deprive readers of the moral rights they expect to receive.</p>
<p>Unreasonable</p>
<p>Even this order, in our view, does not seem to be intended to unduly interfere with legitimate newspaper operations. What is opposed to publication is speeches or declarations, which clearly refers to the full text of speeches or declarations. We do not believe that it intends to interfere with summaries of important speeches issued by news agencies, whether from Chongqing or Tokyo, as such an attitude would not only be impractical but also unreasonable. In other words, we believe this order is intended to prevent the excessive selection of documents for political reasons, causing criticism.</p>
<p>Automatic Acquiescence</p>
<p>In the current situation, we are prepared to comply with this wish. We believe that any newspaper that is of an ordinary commercial nature and published without political motives will acquiesce in this attitude as a temporary emergency measure. However, this so-called automatic acquiescence should not be mistaken for submission to censorship. When the Chinese government governed the area around Shanghai, it made efforts to subject our publications to Chinese censorship. Although we always expressed our willingness to cooperate in a manner that we considered to be based on fairness and sound consciousness, we refused to be censored. As a result, there was a generally satisfactory arrangement.</p>
<p>Self-Examination</p>
<p>We take the same view and refuse to accept the Japanese attempts to censor us. At the same time, we also hope to be reasonable and fair ourselves and not be unaware of the changes that have taken place outside the concession area, which are different from the past. As mentioned earlier, we do not believe that the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities intend to take further action beyond preventing the political manipulation of newspapers in this city. Since our newspaper is of a commercial nature, we wholeheartedly agree with the aforementioned overall goal. On the other hand, we are not at all interested in issuing a censored newspaper and would not be willing to do so.</p>

<h3>Japanese Woman Buying Groceries Suddenly Attacked with an Ax</h3>
<p>Fortunately Uninjured; Escorted Across the Bridge by Store Employees; One Store Employee Summoned to the Police Station for Interrogation</p>
<p>A certain cigarette and paper shop at the entrance of Sanhe Lane, south side of the Sichuan Road Bridge in the Public Concession, located under an overpass at the entrance of the lane, also sells groceries. Yesterday (the 6th) around 12:00 PM, a Japanese woman (around 30 years old), residing in the Hongkou area, brought two children, both around seven or eight years old, to the cigarette and paper shop to buy groceries. While they were discussing prices, a Chinese youth, wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and black pants, around 20 years old, suddenly came along with a sharp ax (with a hook on the ax head) and struck the Japanese woman's head. The Japanese woman fell to the ground injured, but there was no blood flowing from her head. Seeing that his purpose had been achieved, the youth threw the sharp ax at the entrance of the lane and fled south. The shop owner helped the Japanese woman up, and the Japanese woman asked the shop owner to send her and her two children to the north side of the Sichuan Road Bridge. Around 2:00 PM, the Central Police Station sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate, taking away a certain shop employee and a certain coppersmith who had his stall parked at the entrance of the lane. They also found the murder weapon, an ax, on the ground at the entrance of the lane. There was a Chinese letter tied to the handle. The meaning of the letter roughly referred to the ferocity of the Japanese in oppressing the Chinese, that the Chinese must take off their hats and bow when they meet the Japanese, and that the Chinese were extremely resentful, hence this incident. After 4:00 PM, the Hongkou Police Station also sent Chinese and English detectives and Japanese detectives to conduct a detailed investigation and took the shop owner away for questioning before releasing him and the coppersmith. However, the shop employee is still being detained for further investigation due to inconsistent statements.</p>

<p>Children's Weekly - Mother's Day Special Issue</p>
<p>On this Mother's Day, the publication sincerely wishes and pays the highest respects to the mothers of millions of healthy children in China. - Editor</p>
<h3>From Mother's Day to Maternal Education</h3>
<p>- Yang Mou</p>
<p>Mother's Day has arrived again. In this autumn when iron hooves are trampling the land, most families are separated, and the displacement of mothers is naturally expected. Therefore, I want to talk about the issue of "maternal education" because once mothers and children are separated, children will inevitably lose maternal education, which is a very serious problem.</p>
<p>What is maternal education? In fact, maternal education is family education, which is the education given by mothers to their children before and after they enter school. Of course, maternal education has a greater influence on children than school education. We can say that the success or failure of a person's life depends on maternal education. It is remembered that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek also attributed his success to his mother's teachings on his fiftieth birthday. From this, we can know the greatness and importance of maternal education.</p>
<p>Education in schools teaches us how to live and behave in the world, and maternal education, although it is nothing more than this kind of thing, also has the most important thing, that is, "love." Mothers cannot escape "love" for their children everywhere, so this "love" will always be embedded in the child's heart, making them able to love people, understand people, and forgive people... And this "love" is really the greatest thing in the world.</p>
<p>The reason why I want to raise this issue now is that I hope that various charitable organizations will instill some "love" into the education of children who have lost their mothers, so that children can still be educated as if they were receiving maternal education, and there is more hope for success in the future.</p>
<h3>My Mom</h3>
<p>- Mou Ling, Fifth Grader, Minsheng Elementary School</p>
<p>My mom is very young. She has a healthy body and a full spirit, without any sign of aging. Every time I go out with my mom, people always treat my mom as my older sister. How happy I am to have such a young and healthy mom.</p>
<p>Mom loves me very much, just like the moms of other children love their children. I also love my mom very much. I think: There is probably no child in the world who doesn't love their mom.</p>
<p>Mom treats people very kindly. Her face always has a kind smile. She is very polite to everyone, so she often says to me: "Child, you should be kind and humble in dealing with people, don't be arrogant, arrogance leads to failure."</p>
<p>When the weather gets cold, Mom still gets up very early every day. In addition to doing housework, she also knits woolen clothes for me, so I have so many woolen clothes, big and small, dark and light, with many different patterns. I wear them comfortably and beautifully. When people see my clothes, everyone praises my mom's high artistry and envies me.</p>
<p>Every day when I go home from school, Mom guides me in reading and writing. If there are unclear parts in the book, Mom will explain them to me in detail. Sometimes, seeing that I am tired, she will tell me an interesting story or a joke to make me laugh out loud, then I will forget my tiredness and happily do my homework again. Sometimes, Mom often takes me to see plays or go ice skating... Mom likes me so much, but if I do something bad, don't listen to Mom, or don't study hard, then Mom will scold me without hesitation.</p>
<p>My mom is a good mom. I have never left her. I want to spend sweet days in Mom's arms forever.</p>
<h3>My Mom</h3>
<p>- Lin Jiewan, Third Grader, Laigna Elementary School</p>
<p>The person I love the most is my mom. My mom gets up very early every day. She likes to read Shen Bao, and she likes to use domestic products. She never uses any imported products for clothes, food, or utensils, and she also advises us and our neighbors to use domestic products. She is very kind and treats me and my older brother very well. Every Sunday, she accompanies us to play in the park. After resting at home for a while, she tells us to write and read. Sometimes she even tells us to do arithmetic. If we do well, she gives us a bag of candy or a box of building blocks as a reward. She works very diligently at home, wiping the windows very brightly and wiping the tables and chairs very clean, so she organizes the housework very well!</p>
<h3>My Mom</h3>
<p>- Yang Yanggang, Fourth Grader, Yixin Elementary School</p>
<p>Mom is the greatest person in the world. Is there any person or animal in the world that is born without a mom?</p>
<p>On a cold winter night in 1925, I came out of my mother's womb with a cry and entered the world. From that day on, I have been nurtured and cultivated by my mom for many years. She sent me to school, and now I am a fourth grader.</p>
<p>One day two years ago, I was playing soccer with my friends. One of my friends accidentally kicked my foot, so I made a face and kicked back. Unexpectedly, Mom found out and called me into the room, scolded me, and hit my palm more than a dozen times. I cried.</p>
<p>After receiving this strict punishment, I knew that friends should be kind to each other and should not quarrel. So from that day on, I have never quarreled with anyone.</p>
<p>One hot summer, I didn't listen to my mom and ate too much ice cream and watermelon. I became seriously ill and lay on the bed groaning and tossing. She was very sad and anxious, sitting by my side without leaving, busy preparing medicine for me. She only hoped that I would get better soon. After her many days of dedicated care, my illness gradually healed.</p>
<p>From that day on, I knew that what Mom said was right, so from that day on, I listened to everything Mom said and never disobeyed her.</p>
<p>Because Mom saw that I could reform, she often took me to the park, watched movies, and often told me stories, and told me not to do bad things. I felt very happy.</p>
<p>The above two facts are what I personally experienced. I am very grateful to my mom. I hope that all the moms in the world can love their sons like this, and I hope that all the children in the world can respect their moms.</p>
<h3>My Mom</h3>
<p>- Shi Tianrong, Sixth Grader, Hualong Elementary School</p>
<p>No matter whose mom it is in the world, they all love their own children. So my mom must love me, of course. I feel that Mom's love for me is greater than anyone else's. Even Dad doesn't love me like this, because I am closest to Mom. However, when I make mistakes, Mom is also the strictest in punishing me. I remember once, I took a few coins from the table without telling Mom. Later, Mom found out and insisted that I tell her what I bought. I didn't say, so she hit my palm like a teacher in school. Later, I said that I bought candy, so Mom stopped hitting me. She slowly said to me, the following paragraph: "Tianrong! It's not that I don't want to give you money to buy things to eat, because I have seen with my own eyes that there are always many stalls around the entrance of every school, what little book stalls, candy stalls that can ruin your teeth, and red and green colored sugar water, etc. These things are harmful to elementary school students. In addition, there are gambling stalls, etc., which are the most hateful. It doesn't matter if they cheat you out of money, but if you develop the bad habit of gambling, you will definitely not be a good person when you grow up. So I hit you, not because I hate you, nor because I don't like you, but because I want you to become a good person. If you are hungry and want to eat snacks, Mom will buy you good things to eat. Don't go to the stalls to buy those unclean things. There are many problems outside now, and eating unclean things will make you sick. Also, when you take anything, you should tell Mom first, don't secretly take it and run away. At your young age, your own consciousness is not enough, so you must discuss things with your parents in advance. Your parents will never deceive you..." The above is what Mom said to me. I thought it was right, so I wrote down this paragraph for everyone to see.</p>
<h3>My Mom</h3>
<p>- Shen Yanyuan, Fifth Grader, Guanghua Elementary School</p>
<p>I think every child has his mother, but when I was seven years old, my mother abandoned my younger brother and me and left people forever. Mom loved me very much. I remember one winter when I was very sick. The weather was cold. She sat by my bed pouring tea for me. She didn't sleep all night. After a few days, she got sick herself, but she still never forgot me. Mother's illness became more and more serious every day. Later, I got better, and she said to my father, "Yuan'er, you must take good care of her, give her to read, and Qing'er, you take them to their grandmother's house! My illness will not get better." At that time, I didn't quite understand what my mother said. I was happy when I heard that I was going to my grandmother's house, so I went with my father. I didn't get news from my mother for a few days. One day, my father suddenly said very urgently, "Your mother is about to die, what should I do?" My father told me and my brother to go to the hospital to see my mother for the last time, but my grandmother said, "Don't take the children, Yuan'er has just recovered from her illness." Then my grandfather also came back, and when he heard what my father said, he was about to cry. So my grandparents and father all took rickshaws to my mother's hospital. I remember they didn't come back that night. The next morning, my grandmother came back and cried so much that she didn't look like herself. She looked at me and said, "Yuan'er, from now on you will be an orphan without a mother." When I heard this sentence, although I didn't quite understand it, I saw my grandmother crying so badly, and I started crying too. After that, I lost my dear mother. Then my dear father also died. It's been four years now. I have spent these four years in pain. Although my grandparents both love me, I can't forget my mother. Now my health is not good and I am often sick, but my mom will never come to comfort me again.</p>
<h3>My Mother</h3>
<p>— Tang Guizhen, 4th Grade, Minsheng Elementary School</p>
<p>I remember one winter evening, the gray sky filled with fluttering white snow. The earth was enveloped in a vast expanse of white. The weather was so bitterly cold, the northwest wind howling fiercely. At that time, I was lying in my warm bed, constantly clamoring, "I want cake! I want cake!" Seeing this, my mother put on her overshoes, held up an umbrella, and braved the wind and snow to buy it for me. At that time, I only knew to eat the cake, my goal achieved, and that was it. I didn't think about my mother's heart! When Mom saw me sick, her loving face wore a worried expression. She served me with all her heart and comforted me. After I recovered, I felt bored, wanting this and wanting that, and she always gently and kindly complied with me, never showing any sign of annoyance. This was still five years ago.</p>
<p>At that time, Mom was healthy and energetic. I didn't expect that in these short five years, Mom's face has aged so much, and faint wrinkles have appeared on her forehead. Of course, Mom is worried about her children. She has never had a peaceful day. She gets up early and goes to bed late, taking care of the household chores. Because Dad passed away a long time ago, we rely entirely on Mom to manage everything. So Mom often says to me, "Good child! I work so hard to provide you with food and clothing, and to pay for your school fees, hoping that you will study hard and become a useful person in the future, so that I won't have suffered in vain, and it will comfort your father under the nine springs (in the afterlife)." I keep my mother's words in my heart forever, as my motto.</p>
<p>The most respectable, the most great, and the most loving person in the world is Mother. Children! Let's not forget our mothers!</p>
<h3>My Mother</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhipeng, 3rd Grade, Humin Elementary School</p>
<p>My mother treats me very well. When I come home from school every day, she has already prepared snacks for me to eat. When it's cold, she tells me to put on more clothes, and when it's hot, she tells me to take off some clothes. At the same time, Mom also puts in a lot of effort to prepare all my living expenses. Every Sunday, Mom also takes me to the park to play and get some fresh air. Receiving such love and good guidance from my mother, I feel deeply in my conscience that I must study hard in order to repay my mother in the future.</p>
<h3>My Mother</h3>
<p>— Wang Qian, 6th Grade, Minsheng Elementary School</p>
<p>My loving mother, whom I cannot bear to be separated from, nurtures me and shapes me with all her heart and effort. Her kind and gentle demeanor is always deeply imprinted in my mind. She is truly a virtuous and reasonable mother. She loves me very much. I recall last month when I was writing, I suddenly felt dizzy and uncontrollably fell down. In a moment, I opened my eyes and saw myself lying in bed, with my mother constantly comforting me by my side. Seeing her saintly, gentle, and kind appearance, my suffering immediately eased. But when I make mistakes and am punished, her stern words and severe expression are quite solemn and awe-inspiring. But even though Mom puts on an angry face, the kindness between her brows is always faintly visible. Dear mother, your kind and strict teachings make me both afraid and love you. Mother, how great is your spirit! How loving is your heart! The most loving and sacred in the world is only the mother. We have received endless kindness, and we should find ways to repay it. Therefore, I always remember the famous saying of the ancient sages: "Great filial piety is the foundation of teaching the country and protecting the clan."</p>
<h3>My Mother</h3>
<p>— Jia Shoutong, 5th Grade, Qiaoguang Elementary School</p>
<p>"The idea that no one in the world is as great as my mother will always remain in my mind. It's not just me who thinks this way, probably all the children in the world have this idea!</p>
<p>My mother treats me with great love. When I am sick, she sits by my bed all day taking care of me, even forgetting to eat and sleep. When it gets cold, she hurries to make winter clothes for me, and when it gets hot, she makes summer clothes for me. As I grow day by day, the wrinkles on my mother's forehead also increase one by one. She works tirelessly for me all day long. When will I ever be able to repay my mother's kindness?</p>
<p>Not only does my mother love me in this way, but she is also a patriotic person. She never buys inferior goods, and all her daily necessities are bought at national goods stores. She also advises her neighbors not to buy inferior goods, and she also tells me to save my daily candy money and donate it to the country. How great is my mother's spirit!</p>
<h3>My Mother</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhonghe, 6th Grade, Currently Out of School</p>
<p>What I miss the most is my mother, and no love is deeper than a mother's love for her son. Especially me, when I was nine years old, I lost my dearest father. There was only me and my mother in the family, so she was so sad. She often taught me with a compassionate tone: "You must study hard. You must know that children without fathers are definitely the most... sad... How will we... go on from here?" She broke this gloomy atmosphere, weeping with tears, making me, with my stubborn temper, also feel ashamed. I am really sorry for Mom, and finally I lay on my mother's lap and cried, "Mother, please forgive me!" I am now reflecting on myself. Without a father, I can only rely on studying hard, so that my father's soul can also be happy. Mother, "I will study hard from now on, don't be sad!"</p>
<p>Ah! Mom, I now understand what you said to me before. You are truly a benefactor to me. You are such a great nurturer. How will I repay her in the future... and how will I comfort her?</p>
<h3>My Mother</h3>
<p>— Pan Zhimin, 4th Grade, Xinsheng Elementary School</p>
<p>When I was very young, my mother swaddled me. When I cried, my mother would feed me milk. At that time, I didn't know anything and had no memory. When I was two or three years old, I gradually began to understand. She raised me until I was four years old, and then Mom sent me to kindergarten to study. I remember that I suddenly got sick at that time. Mom was very worried and went to invite a very famous doctor to treat me. After taking a few doses of medicine, fortunately, I recovered, but I still didn't want to eat. So Mom went to buy beef juice, chicken juice, ham, and other things for me to eat. After a week, I gradually returned to normal. Only then was my mother relieved. But because of this, my mother's face became much thinner, and she often hoped that I would be healthy. I think the most loving person in the world is my own mother. When I grow up, I will definitely repay my mother!</p>
<h3>My Mother</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qingxia, 6th Grade, Wenzong Elementary School</p>
<p>My mother is only in her thirties, but people think she looks like she's in her forties. Why does she look so old? Because she works very hard! There are seven of us siblings in total. Cooking three meals a day and managing the household are all shouldered by my mother alone. When she sees that the weather is cold, she gives us clothes to wear and makes a pair of cotton shoes for each of us. Seeing that my three younger brothers who go to school are cold, Mom is busy knitting woolen sweaters for them. When she has free time, she also teaches my two younger brothers and sisters to read. And because my father's finances are difficult, Mom puts in even more effort, altering my eldest brother's old clothes for my younger brother to wear. Sometimes when we are fast asleep and our quilts are not properly tucked in, Mom sees it and comes to cover us. Only Mom cares about whether we are warm or cold. She has put in a lot of effort to raise us, how can we repay her? We can only study hard and strive for future independence to repay my mother's boundless grace!</p>
<h3>Motherly Love - A Prototype of 1939 (1)</h3>
<p>— Teye</p>
<p>The Essence of the Play "The Era of Our Lives" by the Famous Czech Writer Capek</p>
<p>An Excerpt from "The City of Paris"</p>
<p>"Characters in the scene: Mr. and Mrs. Reichert, their five sons, Andrew, Julian, Peter, George, and Donny, and the grandfather. (Unnamed) Except for Mrs. Reichert and her youngest son Donny, all are spirits of the deceased. However, in the afterlife, they still do not forget the resistance and national salvation. They want to persuade Donny's mother to send Donny to the front lines to help in the war. Donny's mother, because Donny's four older brothers have all died in battle, is reluctant to order Donny to join the army again. She argues with all her might with the spirits of the deceased. But after Donny knocks on the door and wakes up, hearing the radio report that the enemy killed the children in the school, out of pity and pain for other people's children, she immediately sacrifices her personal love and orders Donny to go and kill the enemy. This kind of great motherly love truly deserves to be called the prototype of motherly love.</p>
<p>(The mother on stage is talking to her dead loved ones. Now, the only one left living in the world is her youngest son, Donny.)</p>
<p>Mother: Don't you love Donny? Not even a little bit?</p>

<p>Mother: Let him suffer! If he stays with Mom, that's a big sacrifice, then he won't be able to be filial to me!</p>
<p>Andrew: He is very filial to you, Mom. We are all filial to you, you know that.</p>
<p>Mother: Don't say that, Andrew. You don't know what love is; you all had other purposes in the world, much bigger than love. I don't have any other purposes, Richard; I can't think of anything bigger in my heart. Donny, this little treasure, I often hold his hand, ... Dear God! Are you all crazy! How can I let such a child leave me, only God knows!"</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Mother's Day, let's all salute Mom!</p>

<h3>Grain - Dumi Uniformly 15 Yuan, Ke Xian Also Reaches 14 Yuan Price Limit - Difficult to Achieve Long-Term Stability</h3>
<p>Since yesterday's meeting of seven rice and grain groups in the National Rice Market, due to the continuous soaring rice prices, which cannot be allowed to continue, it was decided to widen the price limit by one yuan. High-quality white粳 is limited to 15 yuan and must not exceed this price. Yesterday, 11 ships of goods from Fengjing and Nangang arrived in the city, and over 2,000 packages of Che Lun Bao Zi (wheel-packaged rice) arrived from the Su Tong area. Recently, from Wuxi, it was originally calculated at 125 packages per vehicle, and a total of 625 packages arrived at the port. However, because a certain foreign firm wanted to collect a large amount of rice in the Wuxi area, the local area did not have this large quantity available, and all the firms did not accept it. The foreign firm became angry and asked a certain party to intervene, claiming that they were intentionally making things difficult. They also made excuses about the situation, which led to the source of Wuxi rice being cut off again. As for the city-wide sales market, hoarding households have all stopped, and only the shops on this street are slightly replenishing their stocks. However, regardless of whether the rice is thick or thin, 粳, Dumi, or Ke Xian, all have reached the price limit, which is bound to be broken. The Fengjing rice is of the worst quality, but it is also priced at 14.5 yuan, which is the same as the Bao Zi goods. Because the bag skin also needs to be added, it must also be 15 yuan.</p>
<p>Based on the calculation of 600,000 packages of rice in Shanghai's inventory, widening the price limit by one yuan will result in a profit of at least 800,000 yuan. However, because the cost of rice varies, from low to high, the estimated profit is closer to 1.56 million yuan. In particular, the silver money industry and wealthy hoarding households will gain the most, while rice dealers who buy and sell quickly will gain less. Those with strong capital will gain abundant profits. According to the current situation, if there are no corrective measures, the rice price will be raised by three parties, causing a continuous cycle. As the weather gradually gets hotter, the rice will inevitably be damaged after being steamed by thunder. In addition to warehouse rent, interest on dismantling, etc., those who have rice will again have an excuse to raise the rice price again, which is also difficult to predict. Those who are responsible for regulating the people's food should pay attention in advance. If purchasing foreign rice is used as a tool for remedy, it is not necessary to say that one abandons what one has and does not use it, and it is also not a good idea to spend a large amount of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Bian Yuan can still be sold, but high-quality goods still sell for 12.5 yuan, and medium-quality rice for 19 yuan.</p>
<p>Ke Xian was only actively traded on this street yesterday, and the total transaction volume was less than 3,000 packages. As for the selling price, the market has widened the limit by half a yuan. The maximum is 14 yuan, and severe penalties will be imposed for exceeding the limit. Therefore, Nanjing Gao Xian are all priced at the highest price of 14 yuan, while Wu Xian are priced one or two jiao lower. The market seems to be temporarily stable. However, Nanjing local is prohibited from exporting, and Te Gao Jing local is prohibited from exporting. Te Gao Jing Xian is still unwilling to sell cheaply with the market. Since foreign rice rose to 18.5 yuan, importers are not very greedy to handle it, and the market has also turned to a stable trend.</p>
<h3>Quiet Flour Market</h3>
<p>Factory Flour: Since the wind of price increase subsided the day before yesterday, it continued to stabilize yesterday. There is no strong demand from local and out-of-town buyers, and the factory does not supply large quantities, so the overall market can be described as having low supply and demand. According to news from the buyers' side, the price of flour in Tianjin can be sold for more than 5 yuan in Shanghai currency. Transporters are still greedy, but the factory price is too high, so they plan to abandon small profits and take larger ones. Yesterday, the wholesale price of No. 2 flour on this street continued to be 4.5 yuan, and buyers' prices still increased by 2.5 to 5 fen. The total transaction volume was only about 30,000 packages. The market is still brewing.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour: Transactions are as calm as before. It is found that most of the imported American flour from "Tai Li Ti Bie Si" mail ships is reluctant to be released. Except for direct distribution, the amount of goods circulating in the market is not large, so people's hearts are still strong. It is heard that a certain buyer group inquired yesterday, and the selling price of brands such as "Sampan" and "Double Eagle" was 4.55 yuan in cash, including fees, which is roughly equal to the price of local factory flour. The transaction volume was approximately 7,000 packages. The market is also brewing.</p>
<p>Exports: 12,000 packages of flour were shipped to Tianjin on the 7th, and 7,500 packages of flour and 1,000 packages of wheat bran were shipped to Shantou.</p>
<h3>Finance - Xiamen Group Vigorously Buys at Low Prices - Cash Prices Stop Falling and Turn Upward</h3>
<p>The black market conditions for the exchange of cash today have slightly changed, resulting in a slight increase in price, which has returned to the level of 2,110 yuan outside the customs. However, the situation was weak at first and then firm. At the opening, due to the strong selling intention of the money exchange industry, and the cash shops also followed suit and sold off, the opening price was lowered to 2,105 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop (on behalf of the Xiamen group) took advantage of the low price to vigorously absorb the goods. In addition, a certain money exchange industry sold its strength at the same price. Although a certain gold shop came out on behalf of customers' long positions at that time, the supply and demand were still disparate, and the market situation suddenly improved. In the end, the price rose by 4 yuan, and the transaction was still strong in the morning, with approximately 600 taels traded. In the afternoon, it was heard that the buying side once shouted the price up to 2,129 yuan, but there was no transaction. Gold jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged. Customs gold and British pure gold were flat. Chinese pure gold and standard gold rose slightly.</p>
<p>The Black Market Price for Sycee Rises by 4 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial opening price for each bar (10 taels) was slightly weaker due to the strong selling intention of the money exchange industry. The money exchange industry first forcefully sold 100 taels to the gold shop at an opening price of 2,105 yuan, which was 4 yuan lower than the previous transaction. After the opening, the cash shop also sold 50 taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 06 yuan. Subsequently, a certain money exchange industry also sold a total of 100 taels to the same industry at the same price. Before long, a certain money exchange industry suddenly turned to aggressive buying, and a certain gold shop (on behalf of the Xiamen buyer group) continued to absorb goods. Although a certain gold shop cut off speculative long positions on behalf of speculators at that time, the positions were still not enough to distribute, so the market price gradually increased. A certain money exchange industry then entered a certain gold shop for 100 taels at a price of 07 yuan. Subsequently, a certain gold shop also entered a certain gold shop for 50 taels at the same price. Later, a certain gold shop again entered the same industry for 50 taels at a price of 08 yuan, and a certain money exchange industry entered the same industry for 50 taels at a price of 09 yuan. After that, the buying intention of a certain money exchange industry became stronger, and the sellers repeatedly raised the price, so it broke out of the 10 yuan mark. A certain money exchange industry entered the same industry for 50 taels at a price of 10 yuan, and then entered the same industry for 50 taels at a price of 13 yuan. After that, although the price was shouted up to 15 yuan, the sellers still had no intention of supplying goods, so there was no transaction. Therefore, the closing price at noon was 13 yuan. In the afternoon, a certain money exchange industry still wanted to absorb goods at the beginning, and the price was shouted from 15 yuan to 20 yuan, but the sellers still had no intention of supplying goods. After 3:30, the long side suddenly had selling intentions, but a certain money exchange industry had already adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and there were no transactions for half a day. If the closing price at noon was 2,113 yuan, the result was a gain of 4 yuan compared to the closing price at noon on the previous day. The selling price of cash shop's own brand gold was 2,125 yuan, and the receiving price was 110 yuan previously. The current standard gold is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there are no transactions.</p>
<p>The Price of Gold Jewelry Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The exchange price of gold jewelry in silver shops remains unchanged. Datong Bank is 214 yuan, Xintong Bank is 212 yuan, and the receiving price is 206 yuan.</p>
<p>Chinese Pure Gold Follows the Big Four Corners</p>
<p>According to a London telegram on the 5th, the price of British pure gold per ounce remained unchanged at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence. However, the Central Bank's buying and selling of Chinese cash was larger (the bank's holiday was May 4th) by the Big Four Corners, totaling 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed customs gold remained flat, totaling 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also increased by 4 jiao compared to the pre-holiday price, totaling 1,207 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Exchange Rate Slightly Looser - British and American Exchange Rates Unchanged</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market was still busy with settlements by major foreign firms yesterday. In addition, Ying Hang You Li (representing the Tianjin group) and the Japanese banking community also started to compete for the settlement of spot sterling. However, the supply intention of various foreign banks such as British and American banks was still strong, so the market situation remained stable throughout, and the results were flat. Transactions were still strong in the first half of the day. The Hong Kong exchange rate tended to loosen slightly due to the stronger selling intention of foreign banks.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London big bar was still flat in the near and far terms. The New York silver price was stagnant, and the London raw gold also showed no rise or fall. The exchange rates for British, American, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The exchange rates for American, British, Shanghai, and French currencies were also unchanged. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling price of spot exchange rates by banks in the morning was 8 pence and 25 for British currency and 16 yuan and 0.0625 for American currency, which was unchanged compared to the previous closing price. After the opening, although major foreign firms successively settled British and American currencies, the supply intention of various foreign banks such as British and American banks was still strong, so there was no change. It is calculated that the foreign firms settled HSBC's spot British currency at 8 pence and 25, and also settled a certain bank's spot American exchange rate at 16 yuan and 0.0625. When HSBC's listed price was announced, it did not move. And when the silver balance tax was announced, it also did not rise or fall, calculating that it was still charged at 6.25%. After that, although Ying Hang You Li (representing the Tianjin group) and the Japanese banking community also competed to settle British currency, foreign banks such as HSBC still had strong supply intentions, and the market situation did not change. It is calculated that HSBC, Hua Bi, and McGary mutually settled Ying Hang You Li and the Japanese banking community with spot British currency at 8 pence and 25. Subsequently, transactions gradually cleared. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, the foreign bank forcefully sold the spot price to the money exchange industry at 55 yuan and 75, which was slightly firmer. The closing selling price of spot exchange rates by banks at noon was 8 pence and 25 for British currency and 16 yuan and 0.0625 for American currency, which was no different from the opening price in the morning. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 55 yuan and 75. The result was that the British and American exchange rates were unchanged compared to the evening closing price on the previous day, while the Hong Kong exchange rate was reduced by 125. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Strong Demand for French and Vietnamese Notes - Sufficient to Show that Many People are Going to the Southwest</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold and British and American exchange rates did not change. Foreign exchange firms in this port were still busy with settlements. The demand from Japanese banks was also strong. Fortunately, the supply from various banks was smooth, and the market price did not change. Forward foreign exchange tended to stabilize, and the Hong Kong exchange rate also loosened. The black market for sycee opened vigorously. Transactions were not strong. After entering the market, the Tianjin group's buying intention was active, and the price increase was quite strong. The supply from gold shops and silver shops was not smooth, and the closing price at noon was very firm. In the afternoon, people's hearts were uncertain, and there were no transactions. Transactions of foreign currencies such as British and American gold pounds were very active. Although the supply from wealthy people was strong, new absorbers were also not lonely. The supply of British and American gold notes was also smooth. The price decreased due to the stabilization of foreign exchange and the loosening of forward rates. The Hong Kong currency decreased slightly due to the lack of strong demand and the firmness of bills of exchange. The demand for German gold notes was very rare, and the price became more depressed. However, French franc notes and Annam notes, which were essential for traveling to the southwest, continued to rise in price. There were few transactions in the guild. Only Ying Feng exited and Fu He Xiang entered 2,200 French franc notes. Yesterday's market price: British gold notes decreased by 1 fen, American gold notes decreased by 3 li, Hong Kong notes decreased by 2 li, French franc notes increased by 5 hao, Singapore notes decreased by 1 fen, Annam notes increased by 4 fen, German gold notes decreased by 5 fen. Other currencies did not change.</p>
<h3>Call Loan Rate Opens at 9 Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rediscount rate for exchange drawing tickets showed a slight increase. The rate per 1,000 yuan once reached as high as 50 yuan and 7.5 jiao, but in the end, the price returned to 50 yuan and 5 jiao, an increase of 2.5 jiao compared to the previous day. The call loan rate of the Money Industry Association has broken through the 1 jiao mark, continuing to fall by 1 fen, totaling 9 fen. The gradual decline in silver liquidity is a clear indication of the stability of Chinese finance.</p>

<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Cannot Muster Enthusiasm, Foreign Debt Still Shows Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities market, after a one-day holiday, continued to fluctuate. However, due to repeated efforts by the bulls to push up prices, it showed a slight increase. Given the unfavorable environment, major bull players were struggling to induce short covering, aiming to fulfill their desire to exit. Throughout the day, the opening saw buyers like No. 14, No. 35, Runli, Yongkang, and retail investors covering shorts. Sellers included No. 10, No. 18, Qiafeng, and Kanghao, resulting in a balanced struggle. However, as sellers lowered prices and buyers raised prices, a slight increase was achieved. The afternoon continued in the same vein, with bulls striving to maintain market prices, preventing them from falling and achieving a further slight gain of five fen or one jiao. As a result, market prices improved slightly by one jiao five fen to three jiao five fen, except for 96, which dropped by five fen alone. The total transaction volume was estimated at around 560,000 yuan. A simplified table is provided below. Starting next week, the morning trading session will be changed to begin at 9:45 AM.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market: London Market Reports Decline, Refined White Unexpectedly Plunges</h3>
<p>Yesterday, London telegraphs reported a decline in raw white sugar. May declined by a small one-point (pence) to 8 shillings 4 pence, August declined by a small three-point (pence) to 7 shillings 6 pence, August declined by a small three-point (pence) to 7 shillings 6 pence 725, and November declined by a small three-point (pence) to 6 shillings 4 pence and a half. The Netherlands saw no changes. Hong Kong telegram reported a decline of six jiao for bag sugar, priced at $20.40. Therefore, the Guild's assessment continued to show a weakening trend. Spot raw white sugar 24 declined sharply by nine jiao at the original warehouse, initially at $28.70, then to five jiao, while outside warehouses were at five jiao and a half to three jiao. Transshipment goods arriving on the 13th were at $20.20, with 600 bags traded. Bonded warehouse goods were at $19.90 to $20.00, with 400 bags traded. Dutch red sugar declined by four jiao to $19.10 for spot goods and $13.60 for transshipment goods. Taikoo car white B mark declined by one jiao, with West warehouse at $28.50 and East warehouse at two jiao. The remainder followed suit. The local factory's white sugar fell by half a yuan, with Zhenji No. 1 at $28.50 and No. 4 at $27. Guotang opened with 98 bags of Yonghua white sugar at $24.80, with only scattered other transactions.</p>
<h3>Coal: Another Thousand Tons of White Coal Arrive</h3>
<p>Hongji white coal is in ample supply. However, another 1,800 tons arrived on the Marler yesterday, sold on behalf of Yi Taixing and the mainland. Competitors cut prices, with screened lump coal priced at $45 per ton and lump coal priced at $48. From the concession's warehouse, delivery adds to the handling costs.</p>
<h3>Deliberation on Handling Methods for War-Related Losses</h3>
<p>— (Continued) Lu Shanzhi</p>
<p>(III) For any enterprise, if the final annual accounts show a surplus, shareholders can typically demand dividend distribution, after covering losses and setting aside statutory reserves. Enterprises that have suffered war-related damages, if such losses are listed as accumulated losses, then even if there is a surplus, shareholders cannot demand dividend distribution according to law until the losses are fully covered. However, if such losses are listed as deferred assets, then enterprises that should have had losses can still show a surplus, and those that should have had less surplus can show more. As a result, shareholders can demand a larger dividend distribution. (Because once it is recognized that losses can be treated as assets, there can be no restriction on shareholders' demands for dividend distribution.) However, this surplus is actually fictitious. If it is allowed to be distributed, it will inevitably lead to a situation of using capital as interest, which is forbidden even in normal times, let alone after the war when the foundation of the enterprise is already fragile. Therefore, the result of treating war-related losses as deferred assets is tantamount to using accounting techniques to openly violate the legal provision of "no dividends can be distributed without a surplus." This is the third point that needs to be considered from a legal perspective.</p>
<p>(IV) Some may think that listing war-related losses as deferred assets can be amortized over several years, reducing profits and expenses, thereby making the income tax burden more favorable. However, this is not always the case. The calculation of income tax requires determining the ratio based on the amount of net profit and the actual amount of capital, which is then used as the standard for applying the tax rate. But tax rates vary, and the amount of net profit also varies. At the same time, the extent of war-related losses varies from industry to industry, and the operating results in the years after the war also vary. For some enterprises, under certain circumstances, treating war-related losses as deferred assets may be beneficial in terms of taxation. But who can guarantee that there will not be some enterprises where treating war-related losses as deferred assets will be unfavorable in terms of taxation? Therefore, from the perspective of the tax burden, treating war-related losses as deferred assets has both advantages and disadvantages for the government and industry and commerce, and no definitive conclusion can be drawn. This is the fourth point that needs to be considered from the perspective of the tax burden.</p>
<p>(V) For enterprises that have suffered war-related losses, if they have accumulated public reserves and provisions, these can be used to offset the losses in the first year as compensation. However, if the remaining amount is listed as an asset, then apart from amortizing a portion of it during each annual settlement, it will be impossible to quickly compensate for it in the future, even if a large surplus can be generated. At the same time, in the years with subsequent surpluses, should the public reserves still be allocated? Whether this allocated public reserve can continue to be used to offset war-related losses will also become a problem. As for the amortization standard for war-related losses as deferred assets, although the Ministry of Economic Affairs' approval states that it should not exceed one-tenth each year, the original amount of deferred assets will inevitably change if war-related losses need to be determined gradually in the following years, making calculations difficult. This is the fifth point that needs to be considered from an accounting practice perspective.</p>
<p>The above is only a brief overview of the major aspects considered. In reality, the occurrence of problems may become more complex due to the strengths and weaknesses of the past financial foundations of various industries, the differences in property structures, the size of the losses suffered, and the goodness and badness of future trends. From this, it can be seen that war-related losses, whether from the perspective of accounting theory, financial policy, legal viewpoints, tax burden, accounting practice, or post-war recovery, do not seem suitable to be treated as deferred assets and amortized gradually over ten years or more. In the author's opinion, the losses suffered by industry and commerce as a result of this war are indeed significant. However, since the losses have been suffered, they are irrecoverable, and the recovery in the future should be pursued urgently. Therefore, for the sake of industrial and commercial enterprises, it is better to endure the pain temporarily and seek steady progress, rather than clinging to the remnants and struggling to survive. If it is believed that some enterprises have suffered excessive losses and will be difficult to recover without appropriate leniency, it is believed that one should also consider from a stable and effective perspective, rather than concealing losses or artificially inflating assets, which would only lead to future troubles. Below, I will offer some suggestions for handling the issue of war-related losses, but I am not confident whether they are feasible and hope that accounting and business professionals will provide guidance.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Actual Sales Are Sluggish, Yarn Market Relies on Stockpilers, Warehouse Receipts Remain Tight</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, without major highlights. Because prices are high, actual demand has turned sluggish, and the market is fluctuating. However, most in the industry are not bearish on yarn prices. Therefore, while actual transactions are light, inter-trade buying and selling is very active, generally supported and stabilized by stockpilers. One merchant sold a large amount of Double Horse warehouse receipts, while another absorbed them all. The market is balanced in terms of incoming and outgoing chips, and market prices have not changed much. In the afternoon, the market initially strengthened and then weakened. The final price of 20-count Double Horse yarn from outside warehouses was $423, down $2.50 from the previous day.</p>
<p>The initial opening of the spot yarn market followed the previous day's purchase by a certain firm, which led to a price increase in an instant. This day still had lingering effects, with opening prices up by one yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse warehouse receipts was $420. However, the market sentiment was sluggish for spot transactions with the help of brokers, and transactions were also sparse. Inter-trade transactions were 30 bales, with opening prices only at $423, which was actually $2.50 lower than the previous day, indicating that the price of warehouse receipts was firm. This is because spot goods must be sold on the same day and require actual transactions, while warehouse receipts can be held for a long time. This is the reason for the recent tightness of warehouse receipts. After a short while, the market appeared relaxed and showed a tendency to decline, with dispersed sentiment and a drop of one or two yuan. The market then slightly recovered as traders purchased nearly 100 bales of warehouse receipts. At the close, the price of 20-count Double Horse warehouse receipts was $418 to $417.50, and the spot yarn price was $425. The afternoon opening saw fewer transactions due to Saturday, with the warehouse receipt price initially at $417.50 and spot yarn at $424, down one yuan. By the time of closing, it had weakened another yuan. A total of 609 bales were purchased by various syndicates. The market for Double Horse yarn fell by $2.50, Shepherd yarn fell by $4, and other brands also fell by one to three yuan. The opening price of 20-count Heavenly Maiden yarn from the Shenxin factory on the previous day was $410. It was the Xinsheng factory that opened with Golden Tiger brand yarn, which is corrected here. Also, today 680 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou, 85 bales to Hong Kong, 250 bales to Haiphong, and 470 bales to Tianjin. The amount purchased by each syndicate is listed as follows: Inter-trade: 1,345 inland, 239 Hong Kong, 250 Statistics: 1,609</p>
<p>The daily yarn market, which had been experiencing large ups and downs, has returned to normal. The market is increasingly calm, with limited fluctuations. The morning price of 20-count Yueqin yarn was $373, rising to $375. The afternoon opening remained stable, with a slight weakening trend.</p>
<h3>Spot Goods Decrease Daily, American Cotton Rises, Low-Quality Cotton Being Sold Cheaply</h3>
<p>The market price of foreign cotton: The New York cotton market initially fell due to a drop in Liverpool prices and profit-taking by some bulls. Opposition to export subsidies is growing, but the supply of spot goods in the market is decreasing daily. As a result, there were a few transactions, and cotton prices rose. Later, spot merchants made some purchases, resulting in cotton prices rising by seven or eight pounds compared to the previous day. Washington has not yet announced anything regarding the cotton industry bill, but there will be a major change in the cotton market within the day. Yesterday, Indian cotton was predicted to rise by four rupees, Egyptian cotton was flat, and exchange rates showed little change. Converted to legal currency, the price of American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by five jiao per dan, Indian cotton rose by one yuan, and Egyptian cotton remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been quiet due to the high prices of overseas cotton in recent days and the tightness of forward exchange rates, making conversion to legal currency uneconomical. Starting yesterday, transactions at various factories have become quiet again. If foreign cotton prices can fall slightly, it may still attract large transactions. The factory delivery prices of yesterday's cotton market are recorded below:</p>
<p>Raw Material　Category　Delivery Price Including Tax</p>
<p>60-count Egyptian Cotton, Premium　105.10</p>
<p>Same as above, Medium　102.15</p>
<p>80-count, Premium　215.45</p>
<p>Same as above, Medium　115.10</p>
<p>20-count American Middling　88.95</p>
<p>Same as above, Low　75.75</p>
<p>32-count, 97.75</p>
<p>Same as above, Low　88.80</p>
<p>42-count, 99.60</p>
<p>Same as above, Low　87.55</p>
<p>South American Brazilian Cotton, Premium　87.15</p>
<p>Same as above, Medium　84.95</p>
<p>Same as above, Low　81.60</p>
<p>10-count Indian Pingle　65.55</p>
<p>10-count Indian Oomra　71.90</p>
<p>20-count Indian Broach　77.45</p>
<p>24-count Indian Compta　83.50</p>
<p>32-count American Simter　86.90</p>
<p>32/42-count American Pungappa　91.65</p>
<p>There is still no major development in local cotton business. Factory demand is also sluggish, and traders are also at a loss. As a result, market prices have not changed much from the previous day. Recently, Indian cotton prices have been rising, and factories may have hopes for developing eastern cotton. Therefore, the prices of high-quality cotton have not loosened. Low-quality cotton, which is less valuable, is being sold at lower prices. In addition, with the plum rain season approaching, it cannot be stored for long. Therefore, it is best to sell it quickly at a low price. 376 bales of cotton from Subei have arrived in Tongzhou. The current situation of spot cotton is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Low-Quality Cotton　74.00　Xinyu Factory entry　200 bales　Factory delivery via bank transfer</p>
<p>Cotton Type Low-Quality Cotton　74.00　Xiehe Company entry　74 bales　Warehouse delivery in cash</p>
<p>Low-Quality Cotton　68.50　Trader's entry　150 bales　Warehouse delivery in cash</p>
<p>Pingle Cotton　63.50　Anda Factory entry　200 bales　Factory delivery in cash</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton　76.20　Trader's entry　150 bales　Warehouse delivery via bank transfer</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Strong Demand for Bleaching, Dyeing, and Finishing of Piece Goods</h3>
<p>East Piece Goods Remain Promising</p>
<p>Cloth Market</p>
<p>Actual sales remain sluggish. However, most warehouse stockpilers are still bullish. The downward trend in cotton yarn has temporarily stopped, and the market pressure is not heavy. The sales plates of various cloth merchants have gradually stabilized after several days of scattered selling. Sales of white goods are sluggish. A wholesale store on the street added 30 to 40 pieces of coarse cloth, a dyeing factory added over 50 pieces of fine twill and fine cloth. Brokers from Subei and inland areas added 30 pieces of fine and coarse cloth. Stockpilers purchased 100+ pieces of cheap secondhand fine twill, fine cloth and coarse cloth. The demand for bleaching, dyeing and finishing piece goods is abundant from both local wholesale stores and inland brokers. Western-style suits and sportswear requiring yellow-green khaki, lotus root-colored, bleached canvas and white drill, broadcloth, serge, etc. are driving purchases from the garment industry, making the market particularly strong. Demand from the southwest Sichuan and Yunnan provinces are both sluggish. A Chengdu broker sought over 1,000 bolts of autumn and winter style flannel and broadcloth, a Guangdong broker sought over 2,000 bolts of colored cloth and over 800 bolts of bleached cloth, a guerrilla area in Jiangsu and Zhejiang sought over 20 pieces of white coarse cloth, and 3,000+ bolts of matched white cloth, including poplin, bleached cloth, striped bleached cloth, floral plain linen, colored cloth and satin. A Bengbu broker sought over 50 cases of blue cloth and colored twill.</p>
<p>East Piece Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday, sales of white fine cloth and fine twill were strong due to active dyeing and finishing purchases on the street. Traders also bought at low prices, with transactions reaching 1,400 pieces. The fine cloth market turned firm, with 12-pound Longtou fine cloth rising from $14.00 per bolt to $14.50 per bolt, a one-jiao increase. Fine twill still showed no signs of improvement, and lower-quality goods showed a softening trend, opening at $12.90. Foreign firms did not open for business. According to traders, the market outlook is still promising.</p>
<h3>Oilcake: Sharp Rise and Rapid Fall in the Oil Market</h3>
<p>The sharp rise in the oil market in mid-April to the end of the month was unprecedented in the last sixty years. Dalian soybean oil reached a staggering record high of $49, and Jiaozhou raw oil reached $45 (both occurred on April 24). Although this was attributed to the special wartime environment, there were clear signs of monopoly and manipulation. After the resolution of futures conversions, the incoming goods continued to arrive in an endless stream, so the market sentiment has plummeted in the last two days, and prices have declined sharply. Yesterday, 1,500 pieces of Jiaozhou peanut oil were opened for trading at $32, a sharp drop of $5 from the previous market. 130 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded at $43.30 to $43.00, down another $1.50 from the previous market.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Dalian Soybeans Approach the Nine-Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Dalian soybeans continued to weaken due to the Tianjin syndicate's dumping of 60 carloads of goods, which were immediately divided and shipped to Shanghai by four ships, including Haiping and Xiangtai. The market price fell to the nine-yuan mark, opening at $8.95 to $8.88. Subsequently, one or two trading firms acted as scalpers and stabilized the market, and prices slightly rebounded, eventually closing at $8.92, with a total of six or seven carloads traded. Sales of sand yellow beans and Doudou beans turned dull, and market prices slightly recovered. 300+ bags of Tianjin beans were traded at prices ranging from $8.92 to $8.88, 20 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans were traded at $8.92, and 50 bags of Pudong Doudou beans were traded at $9.80, with medium-sized ones at $9.30, and 100+ bags of Pinghu Doudou beans were traded at $10.03, with medium-sized ones at $10.00.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 9,720 bags of beans were imported and oily from Tianjin to Shanghai. Today, 250 bags were exported to Europe and 150 bags were exported to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>A Short Note on the Beethoven Concert</h3>
<p>— Jinhua</p>
<p>The Beethoven concert held at the American Church on Bédang Road the day before yesterday aimed to raise funds for refugee children through ticket sales. A similar charitable event, a performance of "The Holy City" by a large chorus, was held half a year ago, with remarkable success, as detailed by Chinese and foreign newspapers at the time. This time, it was still a large chorus led by Mr. Zhao Meibo, along with performances by several renowned professors. In these times of national crisis and deep suffering, we, the people abandoned on this isolated island, are dully silent as if we have no strength left to even groan. In this May, once stained with blood and symbolizing fiery passion and a tragic atmosphere, this concert dedicated solely to performing Beethoven's works will bring much excitement to people!</p>
<p>Out of love for Beethoven, for the passion that fills his works, for his tumultuous life, and for the sympathy and resonance in people's hearts evoked by his works, I dragged my uncle and aunt along to participate in this grand event. It was my first time participating in a concert featuring a great master. I had heard Beethoven's symphonies and piano sonatas before. His works are never easy, lighthearted, or clear-cut. Even a short piano piece leaves one with an impression of melancholy – not a silent melancholy, but a fervent, solemn, and earth-shattering cry, almost like your own cry.</p>
<p>He wrote two great Masses in his lifetime, one being the Mass in D and the other being the Mass in C, which was performed this time. In his religious works, as we can hear in this Mass in C, he tried to adhere to a typical religious effect, but it was secondary to expressing his zeal and reverence for God. Therefore, because his works are few in number, general experts dare not try them. Especially with a huge chorus, to perform the music itself without a single flaw seems too difficult. This time, Mr. Zhao worked tirelessly to conduct such a difficult piece, and his spirit and perseverance are deeply admirable.</p>
<p>At 8:30 PM, an elderly professor walked to the piano on the stage and sat down. Then, a violin and a cello harmonized, and the first program, the Trio, began. Professor Zakarov's piano playing, needless to say, had reached the point of perfection. Professor Livshitz's violin and Professor Xue's cello were able to maintain harmonious ensemble with the piano. Especially at the beginning of the third movement, the light, agile, and ethereal mood made everyone's faces light up. After the Trio, the program was a Sonata for violin and piano. The pianist was a beautiful Western lady. Although she was young, her strength was very strong, so the audience never felt any relaxation from beginning to end. Mr. Xu's violin was able to control the piano, which was indeed very strenuous. His expression of emotions was also very satisfying. Many foreign audiences paid close attention to and were amazed by this Chinese violinist.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of intermission following the Sonata, the grand Mass in C began. When Professor Zhao Meibo stepped onto the podium, the audience greeted him with warm applause. Then, the hundred-odd singers and the full house of listeners followed Mr. Zhao's baton and began the great Mass. Perhaps because the conductor was so serious, every singer was striving to concentrate their energy, so the power of this Mass was consistently present from the first movement to the sixth. When singing the several "Amens" at the end of the second movement, the sound was very impassioned. The fifth movement, with the entry of four soloists into the chorus, was also very moving. This was the part that I personally felt was the most brilliant performance in the entire Mass.</p>
<p>As for the four soloists, Ms. Zhu, the soprano, had the most rounded voice and sufficient breath. The alto was relatively weaker, and the voice was not low enough, but the notes were clear and audible. The tenor had many songs, and some places were difficult. The baritone's voice was also good, but his opportunities were few, which was a pity.</p>
<p>Here, I felt that there were too many sopranos, so that the soprano often covered up other parts during the large chorus. However, generally speaking, if we raise our current Chinese music level to the same height as other countries, then this large chorus cannot be said to be a great success, let alone that all the participants in the chorus are young Chinese students, training within a limited period of time to perform a great and difficult chorus, and achieving such results, what more can we ask for?</p>
<h3>Sincerity and Falsehood</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>In war, there is no room for aversion to deception. So it is with diplomacy. The so-called maneuvering and negotiation are all about tactics and deception. Therefore, honest people cannot be diplomats.</p>
<p>However, if one uses deceptive tactics all the time, others, who are not children or fools, will not be deceived. Therefore, the tricks of deception will eventually run out. Especially when there are conflicting interests, everyone should be sincere and work together.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who treat others with falsehood will be treated with falsehood in return; those who treat others with sincerity will be treated with sincerity in return. In the end, sincerity will prevail and falsehood will fail.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Enduring Grief and Hardship, Tears Sprinkled on All Sides; Cherishing Frugality and Labor, Ten Acres Diligently Tilled</p>
<p>This acting troupe, led by Mr. Jin and Ms. Wang, later went abroad. First, they went to the Nanyang Islands, then to the Philippines, then sailed to San Francisco, and then to various parts of the Americas. They used the form of drama to awaken overseas Chinese and support the motherland's resistance against the war. They planned to raise 500,000 yuan through ticket sales from overseas performances, which would be used to establish two well-equipped military hospitals in China. Who knew that after arriving in various places, the overseas Chinese of our country were so moved by their performances that the proceeds from ticket sales alone exceeded 500,000 yuan. In addition, the donations raised by the touching performances totaled 1.5 million US dollars. They then established many small factories in China to support these disabled veterans, enabling them to engage in production and make a living. Therefore, it must be said that the acting troupe's contribution during China's war was indeed significant. After Mr. Jin and Ms. Wang returned to China, they continued to work hard in the theater world. This time, when they came to Soochow University, they invited him to direct this play, "Tears of the Xiang River." Because they had been with the army during the war and had lived in Hunan for a long time, they were familiar with all the backgrounds. With him directing, it became even more realistic and reasonable. After the director's opening remarks in front of the curtain, a round of applause erupted, and the first act of the play began. Moreover, there was a miracle in today's play: the actress playing the female lead, Xiang Zi'er, in "Tears of the Xiang River," was also a female student at Soochow University. Her surname was Lin, and she was only eighteen years old, but she had eyebrows like a new moon and a face like a rosy dawn. Although schools nowadays don't have anything like the former empresses or princesses, or the insulting terms of Eastern Palace or Western Palace, her beauty could be called the best in the school. Although Miss Lin's father was Chinese, her mother was Japanese. Ten years ago, her mother's fate was almost the same as Xiang Zi in the play. The difference was that Miss Lin's father was a businessman, an overseas Chinese in Nanyang, and had passed away before returning to his homeland. Later, Miss Lin followed her mother and lived in a Japanese village for several years. Miss Lin's father was Chinese, and she wanted to come to China. Miss Lin had an uncle who also taught at Soochow University. Miss Lin's maternal grandparents were also unfortunately deceased, so she accompanied her mother to Suzhou to live with her uncle, and she herself studied at Soochow University. Of course, she could speak Japanese, having lived in Japan with her mother for several years, accustomed to Japanese customs. Dressed in Japanese women's clothing, it would be impossible to tell she was Chinese. (103)</p>
<h3>"The Citadel"</h3>
<p>— Yan Hua</p>
<p>Produced by MGM, Showing at Cathay Theatre</p>
<p>When we excitedly listened to Robert Donat's speech to the medical association, we were immersed in an atmosphere of justice and fairness. Robert Donat said, "Don't you all know Louis Pasteur? He wasn't even a formal doctor! But what great contributions he left for the medical field!..." The author of this book, "The Citadel," A.J. Cronin, was perhaps also inspired by this; at least, in this work, the author launches a fierce attack on general quack doctors. Under this theme, the author created a young doctor who just graduated from medical school, finding a place for himself and barely getting married, but he was too poor. Later, due to opposition from the miners, he left the mining area and went to London. By chance, this young poor man suddenly became wealthy. Like other doctors, he didn't put patients first, until finally his good friend died at the hands of a quack doctor, and he woke up, scolding the current doctors in the medical association.</p>
<p>In such a story, one cannot help but think of the films "The Story of Louis Pasteur" (i.e., Louis Pasteur) and "The White Angel," which depict the noble spirit of doctors and nurses serving humanity, which cannot but move people.</p>
<p>Among some films that are exclusively about romance and nonsense, we have recently seen two more meaningful works from MGM (Shaw's "Pygmalion" and Cronin's "The Citadel"), which is indeed gratifying.</p>
<p>However, in terms of production techniques, I think "The Citadel" is far inferior to "Pygmalion." Although it was also filmed in the UK, and also uses many British actors, and also is full of the special temperament of the British, even with the support of the great director King Vidor, it still feels not tight and powerful enough.</p>
<p>If only the actors are considered, Robert Donat's young doctor is very well-acted, and Rosalind Russell as his wife is also very delicate and composed. But the failure of the whole film is not the failure of the actors, but the sloppiness of the script and direction. Although the film is long enough, there are still many redundant parts, while many places that should be described are passed over very hastily.</p>
<p>The main reason, I think, is that the screenwriter did not grasp the center of the whole play, that is to say, after writing about the young doctor Manson's change of attitude later, he should have strengthened the description of his medical absurdity and his pain when he sometimes reflects, and many unnecessary scenes, such as playing golf, etc., can be omitted. In this way, writing about his conscience after awakening will definitely achieve better results.</p>
<h3>Eradicate Gambling</h3>
<p>— Cai Qing</p>
<p>The newspapers of the past two days have published various news about gambling dens: Three more gambling dens will be added to the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Area: The Concession authorities are strictly enforcing the blockade of traffic to gambling dens: Gambling losses involve embezzlement of accounts. Due to the simultaneous publication of these three news items (if you pay more attention, there are more records in the past newspapers), we can guess that the gambling trend, which poisons the people and disturbs public order, is probably returning to its former prosperity.</p>
<p>During the years of the Republic of China sixteen and seventeen, the gambling dens in the Shanghai Concession also created the highest record of terror, but finally, under the efforts of the Concession authorities, the source of crime was eliminated. After the outbreak of the war the year before last, the gambling dens in the Extra-Settlement Area began to stir again, even publishing advertisements and distributing leaflets to induce people to gamble. And the Concession authorities, because the police power could not reach, could only how to prevent it from spreading to the concession, such as strictly enforcing the blockade of traffic to the gambling dens, which shows that the greatest effort has been made within the police power. However, the increase in gambling dens, and the discovery of gambling debts and embezzlement, also show that in the end, some confused people unknowingly fall into hell.</p>
<p>After the war, the cost of living in Shanghai increased daily, and the number of unemployed people also increased. It seems worthy of our pity that doctors are confused, have a fluke mentality, and go to gambling dens to put everything on the line, but if you can calm down and think about it, in addition to all the huge expenses such as "protection fees" and "expenses," there are also shocking profits. If they are not recovered from the gamblers, how can these gambling dens survive? Instead of having a fluke mentality, it is better to use this spirit to work hard in one's own career. "Struggle to survive" is the motto of everyone. In this way, these gambling dens built on fragile "opportunities" will also self-destruct. Therefore, the Concession authorities' blockade of traffic to gambling dens, and everyone not gambling, is the best way to cooperate to eliminate gambling dens.</p>

<h3>Wartime Japanese Films</h3>
<p>— Xin Yi</p>
<p>Since Japan launched its war of aggression against China, their film industry has gradually declined, and the recent popularity of Japanese pornographic films can be said to be a reflection of the recession, and enough to prove the failure of their wartime cultural policy; originally, the result of excessive control over the people's freedom of thought can only deepen the reactionary psychology of the people. If you want to use art to encourage the so-called "glorious war" in order to anesthetize the people to participate in the fascist group they consider sacred, you must first restrain the people's thoughts. They know that if the subject matter of films is not limited to the narrow scope of "praising the war," it may be very detrimental to the warlords' aggression, but the Japanese people, under heavy oppression, have long seen through the warlords' expectations and no longer want to be driven by them, like lambs submissive to the hateful soldiers.</p>
<p>Film is a reflection of society, a propaganda of culture, and in modern countries, it has undoubtedly become a spiritual food needed by the masses. The Japanese people, having exposed the warlords' numb propaganda and various selfish and deceptive attempts, consciously abandoned various films that praised the "imperial army" and described the "sacred war," and had to look to the other side to find their net spiritual food. In this situation, pornographic films became a deformed development. Due to the unstoppable rise of anti-war sentiment in the country, pornographic films that cater to low tastes have shown a trend of activity. We speculate that the reason for the popularity of these pornographic films is nothing more than to vent the public's accumulated depression, alleviate their contradictory thoughts, and give the public a high degree of stimulation, so that they can temporarily forget the pain they are suffering. The farther the subject matter of the film is from reality, the more favorable it may be in the minds of the warlords?</p>
<p>An old Japanese professor said, "Shellfire destroyed the ivory tower." Yes, Japanese wartime films will never find cultural and artistic value again.</p>
<p>When the soldiers saw this, they could not help but feel hidden worries, so after the Minister of Culture Araki once hosted the film industry to explain the government's newly passed law prohibiting young people from watching love films, he recently banned the filming of films depicting lucky games. This is somewhat puzzling to us; we don't know whether the so-called lucky game films refer to war films, since they only understand the impropriety of lucky games, then their invasion of China, is it a gamble-style desperate lucky shot?</p>
<p>Because of the result of promoting war films, the various contradictory forms expressed by the Japanese film industry will become more and more obvious; and Japanese culture and art will also be buried in the hands of the warlords. Just by looking at the Japanese films wandering under the swords and guns, you can see the situation.</p>

<h3>George Ke Does Not Do Movies</h3>
<p>— Hui Cun</p>
<p>Will Go to the Philippines to Study Wireless Electricity</p>
<p>The child star George Ke in Hong Kong now is still as lively and cute as in the film "Lost Lamb," but although he is still a child, he understands everything about adults thoroughly. People who see him often feel that he already has the habits of an adult. They may wonder why his innocent appearance in Shanghai disappeared so quickly? Is it the environment of Hong Kong that created him, or is it his own psychological abnormality?</p>
<p>He rarely acts today, and still spends his days idle. It is said that at the latest before June, he will go to the Philippines. Because he has an uncle who works at the customs there, and several brothers who also work together, one of whom is a senior staff member in a wireless electricity company, his purpose in going there is to learn wireless electricity.</p>
<p>George Ke's family economic situation is not very good, and the current living situation is not good. Now people no longer read him acting. Originally, child stars in Hong Kong have never been valued. Therefore, he must leave the film world and go to another society to find a way out.</p>

<p>Furthermore, although each side has four styles, any one style on each side always has the same style as one of the other three sides, such as the first style of outward advance, the second style of outward retreat, the third style of inward advance, and the fourth style of inward retreat, which are all the same. In short, these four styles can be listed as A, B, C, and D, as in the following two tables:</p>
<p>When practicing, the first step can first follow the order of A, B, C, and D in the first table, and continuously practice each side. After each style is mature, the second part then refers to the second table to study which is the first and second style of a certain side? Which is the third and fourth style of a certain side? The third step can then study what style is used when or when doing what kind of pattern? If you proceed in this way, it is rare to fail.</p>
<h3>Great Stage Performers Comfort Isolated Army</h3>
<p>— Jing Lu</p>
<p>After the Yifeng Drama Society launched the initiative to comfort the isolated army, the Great Stage performers also responded. As a result, a total of fifty-one yuan was donated, and eight dozen cans of corned beef and four dozen cans of anchovies were bought. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, they prepared an official letter and went with Li Ruilai, Han Wenkui, Li Junyu, and a reporter, and asked Wang Zhongping of the Yifeng Society to guide them.</p>
<p>When we arrived there, after completing the signing procedures, we entered the isolated army camp. The company commanders Shangguan Zhibiao, Tang Di, and Lei Xiong came to meet us. First, Company Commander Shangguan led us to visit their dormitory, and then we sat in his bedroom for a conversation.</p>
<p>They expressed their gratitude for the food we sent and said, "As long as you can come to see us, you don't have to bring anything. We feel very comforted." Company Commander Shangguan poured tea for us with a thermos, and we hurriedly thanked him and said there was no need. He said with a smile, "You came here, there is no hospitality, do you still want to save us some boiled water?" After he poured it, he handed it to us cup by cup. As I drank this cup of boiled water, I really felt it was as flavorful as jade nectar. After hearing his words, I was almost moved to tears.</p>
<p>Company Commander Lei excitedly reported everything that had happened in the past, and said that he could be a lawyer as soon as he went out, and that he also had parents and a wife at home, but living here, he did not feel resentful.</p>
<p>We talked for a long time and felt that we should leave, so we bid farewell to all the dear soldiers and agreed to meet again later. They sent us to a small gate guarded by White Russians and stopped, saying, "This area inside the barbed wire is our territory, we can only send you here, goodbye." We bowed farewell, but hearing these two sentences, we couldn't help but feel sad again, and our eyes were filled with tears that didn't flow out, and we walked back in disappointment.</p>
<p>It is said that the Yifeng Drama Society will go to the isolated army camp to perform today. I don't know if it can become a reality.</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of Liyuan</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Reason for the Increased Status of Actors After the Republic of China</p>
<p>At the same time, a corpulent and wealthy man, surrounded by attendants, walked into the theater. Director-General Wu, every afternoon, except for sometimes holding some meetings, always spent the remaining free time in Boss Shang's residence. Later, this Director-General even ordered his subordinates to bring official documents to Xiao Yun's home for review. Fortunately, the Shang family had inner halls, outer living rooms, small study rooms, and many guests, so it could be accommodated. For a while, the gate of the Shang residence in Chunshu Hutong was crowded with cars and horses. Since major politicians took pleasure in supporting actors, the general petty politicians catered to the major politicians' preferences, and all tried their best to win over famous actors, considering it a shortcut to official promotion and wealth. Shang Xiaoyun had the final say in front of Wu Yulin, so the general staff and those who wanted to find a position in the department all held Xiao Yun like a god. Xiao Yun often called himself Lord Shang and often showed a proud appearance, and it was all that period that cultivated his bad character. Once, when he was performing in Shanghai, he suddenly lost a wallet on Lingpu Road when he was about to return to Beijing after the expiration of his contract. He almost cried out in anger, and immediately ordered people to call the car guard and ticket inspector to his box, and said, "Okay, even our master's things can be lost! If you can't find it back, don't even think about doing your job"! This scared them so much that they were at a loss, and they quickly asked him how much money he had lost, and everyone was willing to collect it and compensate him. Who knew that this Lord Shang would definitely not agree, and insisted on finding the original object back, and would not forgive them. When the car arrived in Tianjin, the stationmaster and section chief came to apologize to him together. Although he reluctantly agreed, after he saw his godfather Wu Er Ye in Beijing, he still insisted on dismissing the section chief and car guard. Later, someone told him not to make a big deal out of this little thing, which would cause public anger from the outside world, and that would make him look bad. He then understood that he was just an actor, and what right did he have to dismiss this and replace that, so he put the matter aside.</p>
<p>If we try to compare and study the reasons for the increased status of Cheng Yanqiu, Shang Xiaoyun, Zhou Xinfang, and Sun Juxian, we can know that the two are not very different. Fortunately, the general warlords and politicians after the Northern Expedition have been completely eliminated. Otherwise, I am afraid that anyone who wants to find a small position in the military and political circles must first go to the gate of a famous actor, and then they can get what they want. May I ask if that would still be a country? —(V)—</p>
