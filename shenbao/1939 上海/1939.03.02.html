<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本企圖控制租界的迷夢</h3>
<p>最近因為偽組織的大小傀儡，接連在滬被人暗殺很多，日本總領事三浦曾向上海公共租界當局，先後提出兩次照會。傳聞對於租界的治安問題，頗多指摘；並要求租界當局和日本「合作」，共同取締租界內的所謂恐怖行動。這類暗殺事件的發生，到底是華人的鋤奸行動，還是漢奸們同類相殘，甚或是別方面另有作用的苦肉妙計，在案件未獲得解决以前，我們用不着妄加揣測；不過日本對於最近上海暗殺事件的特別重視，她的眞正用意何在，這却很值得中外人士的注意。</p>
<p>自華軍撒離滬郊以來，上海曾發生過不少的暗殺事件。這些暗殺事件內中不少是基於政治的原因，基於政治原因的暗殺事件，絕非軍警的力量所能消滅，任何國家莫不為然；就日本警衛森嚴的在華佔領區城而論，偽杭州市長的被暗殺，無錫的暗殺案多至每日平均五件，日軍也都無法事先預防，事後破案。上海是一個關係極複雜的大都市，而被人唾棄的傀儡們，又常在租界內大事活動，可是上海租界當局，除却在日軍佔領下的虹口以及偽組織勢力籠罩的滬西越界築路區域，無法行使職權外，對於一般治安的維持，結果很是美滿，這是租界中外居民所公同承認的。至於最近僞組織人員之被刺，發生的地點旣在日軍控制下面，為公共租界警權所不及的越界築路區域，這對租界當局，當然毫無責任可言。</p>
<p>日本重視最近上海的暗殺事件：實際上絕不是為着暗殺事件的本身，乃是想藉此而對租界企圖控制。日本要求增强她在各地租界內的權力，過去已和各地租界當局交涉過多次；而取消租界的要求，近來差不多也已成為日本的普遍論調。日本認為要達到獨霸遠東封鎖中國門滬的目的，非剷除歐美在華勢力的最後根據地租界不可。現在的租界如天津漢口上海等地，在形勢上雖然都已經成為孤島，但仍留有不少的中外人民，而且這些地方的經濟活動，在日軍佔領區域內仍還具有極巨大的勢力。過去日本在華北實施日圓集團計劃，曾對中國法幣多方設法加以破壞，卒以中國政府的處置得當，和人民對法幣的絕對信任，致日本擬以偽鈔代替法幣的政策，終於失敗。而日本一部份經濟學者，都認租界為支持法幣的根據地，指租界具有極濃厚的政治色彩，據昨天本埠字林西報天津通訊載稱：華北日當局現强施行使法幣的懲罰條例，北平因為沒有租界，人民只能屈服，天津英法租界內偽幣却不見流行，這便是一個鐵證。因此租界便成了日人眼裏的鐵釘。</p>
<p>並且現在日本在中國所佔領的區域，僅是一些交通路綫和較大城市，在這些區域之內，除租界外，不是成為一片焦土，就已早成毒賭世界；本來中國的主要工商業活動，大部分是集中在闢有租界的幾個大都市；自經這次中日戰爭，中國游擊區域內的一切經濟活動，又完全集中到這比較安全的租界裏面。日本在其所佔領的區域之內，不能取得一切經濟活動的統制，就不能達到她經濟侵略的目的，所以日本最近一再放出空氣，說要由日本手裏，取消各國在華租界和領事裁判權。這次日本為上海治安問題而向上海租界當局提出牒文，顯然的是對上海租界企圖控制的一種試探工作。</p>
<p>上海租界當局和日方的交涉，現時正在進行，而倫敦和東京兩地的當局，也還在密切注視其發展，足見這不僅是上海工部局本身的職權變動問題，而是歐美在華勢力的根本存在問題。英政府最近已有表示，决不變更上海工部局的現行組織，同時也希望其他與租界有關係的歐美國家和英國採一致的態度，共同阻止日本侵略野心的發展，總也算是他們對於日本遷就的讓步己經存有相當的限度了。租界中的中外納說居民，也應一致起來，擁護工部局自行維護治安合理的態度，免致特區裏自治的警權，落到獨裁勢力手裏才好。</p>

<h3>僞幣毫無信用　平津靑烟貿易衰落　大連情形尤為慘淡　津地日軍為遊擊隊所困</h3>
<p>大陸報云、某著名美商赴北平·天津·烟臺·靑島·與北方其他口岸游歷返滬、昨（二十八日）據談稱、因滙兌限制之故、華北貿易已减縮至以物易物為基礎、即此種貿易亦屬至微、日當局厲行准許入口之新條例、即須經橫濱正金辦理滙兌、以及强迫華人使用偽幣、致使出口貿易已陷於停頓中、輸入貿易長此遭禁、輸出貿易必受同等損失、天津與烟臺之進出口商行乃設法行以物易物之法、即出貸出口信用放款、以易進口滙票、當然此種方法不能完全抵消滙兌之損失、但可將損失减至最低限度、而華北商人相信、即此以物</p>
<p>易物制度　認日當局亦不准彼等長此實行也、天津出口業以農民之農產佔大宗、但自日軍侵佔該區以還、農業活動即行激减、據僑居華北多年者語余云、已往數月來、農民確已放棄彼等之田地、移居內地或城市、華北鄕間荒廢之田地頗多、據出野狀態察之、農民顯無春耕之準備、此舉由於兩種影響、其一日軍為軍事目的或報復游擊隊之活躍計、摧毀農村、攫奪農產、故農民對土地不復關切、其二亦頗重要、即大批農民服從焦土政策、離鄕他適、留下荒田、作為侵略者之酬報、日軍當局取締許多或能用作軍事目的之貨物出口、幾使商業</p>
<p>完全停頓　就中國商人而論、實行商業限致、反使彼等注目於土地、蓋大多數中國商人對持有現金、輙覺不安、亟欲儘速變現金為產業、彼等對「聯準銀行」及其偽幣、絕不信任、雖亦偶爾使用、乃在某種情勢下被迫出此、余所接觸之大多數中國商人頗願以偽幣打六折而易國幣、余信彼等願以偽幣打四折而易外幣、關於此點、余能就自己經騐而言、日當局對以偽幣易外幣無論其定何比例、絕不能償願、余曾試以偽幣易外幣、甚至「聯準銀行」本身亦不願接收其偽幣、凡此種種因素、加以考慮後、對華北</p>
<p>外國貿易　之前途、即易於抱樂觀態度矣、記者詢華北之行、曾見游擊隊活躍之徵象否、該美商答、余勾留天津時、日軍官間狀殊惶惶、頗不自安、兩週前、日軍派出巡邏兵二十五名、偵查游擊隊所在地、但一去不返、兩天後、復派五十人、亦未返營、於是日軍乃不敢離天津一步矣、天津與烟臺近郊之鄕鎭、晝間雖有日軍防守、但入晚彼等均返警備司令部、非待拂曉</p>
<p>不敢出外　沿平津鐵路余曾見橋樑一座、正在修理中、他人吿余云、此橋係一週前被游擊隊所毀壤、余盤桓北方、雖未親見作戰、但某晚居北平某旅舍中、曾為重砲聲所震動、澈夜未停、次日、日當局稱砲聲為打靶練習、但據北平外僑語余、附近中日軍曾有激戰、至於大連、昔為繁盛之城市、今則完全衰落、見其最象令人失望、余對大連之狀態頗感驚訝、蓋余離美來華前、猶見滿洲「當局」所寄發之書籍一冊、其中刋有大連興盛狀况之照片也、</p>
<p>字林報載天津通訊云、此間貨幣狀况、未有變動、而平津兩地情形、大相懸殊、北平因無租界、故日人能強行施用法幣之懲罰條例、因是聯準之紙幣乃見升水、天津則此項偽幣須作折扣、始能行使、折扣之數、約與北平升水之數相埒、去年十一十二兩月、天津十元五元之法幣、甚感缺乏、今已不復有此困難、租界中聯準偽幣、絕少見之、日當局前因英美銀行不承認聯準偽幣為合法通貨、嘖有煩言、所可異者、與日本締結反共公約至相親善之德義兩國設於天津之銀行、亦照英美銀行之辦法、拒用聯準偽幣、此項偽幣之不能受人信用、於此可見一斑矣、</p>
<h3>海南島淪陷後　日軍未能深入</h3>

<p>發砲轟擊　上岸騷擾日方為刦奪漁業計、乃勾結偽方在上海楊樹浦設立偽魚市塲、企圖剝削漁民、然舟山各島漁民深明大義、堅不與其合作、日軍即遷怒出海漁民、二月五日中午、日艦三艘突駛人定海港內離岸四百米突處下錨停泊、嗣即放下汽艇往來窺伺、該地防軍為保衛國土計、乃發槍一排射擊、日艇始竄回原艦、日兵以登岸未逞、竟惱羞成怒、發砲九響向東嶽宮（離城里許）一帶轟擊、</p>
<p>被毀殿宇　多處、擊斃廟祝翁阿四一人、入晚該艦復開十一砲向岸轟擊、彈落衛頭碼頭旁象春菜館一帶、翌晨復開十砲後始行他駛、當時該地居民因初聞砲聲、相率疏散四郊鄕村、城內居民遷避一空於日艦他駛後、始漸次返家、至十六日下午、又有日第四號艦一艘駛入　頭港內下錨停泊、擅扣民船、泊一宵後至次日上午十一時許、復開砲十一發向岸轟擊、被毀東獄宮太歲殿一部、墻基少許、宮下樂來賓家亦落一彈、毀軒子一間、楊家塘胡家橋等處、</p>
<p>亦落多彈　、被毀民房少許、並擊傷居民王小滿一人、當日艦發砲向岸轟擊時、定海縣自衛會等不避難險、出入砲火担任通訊工作，此時定海居民雖離日艦僅三四里之遙、然司空見慣、沉着鎭靜、極為雜得、日軍屢圖在定海縣城附近登岸、兩度砲擊迄無效用、日第四驅逐艦隊艦三艘、乃於廿一日上午十時許駛入縣城北面之岱山島高亭鎭對面港面、不斷向岸發砲轟擊、先後共計五十餘發、彈落新　頭一帶、被毀高顯廟及天后宮一部、毀民房二十餘間、彈傷民人朱杜法之妻、又有二彈落老　頭新同興南貨店、被毀房屋數間、傷夥計二人、至下午二時許該三艦縱火將停泊港內之瑞鴻號等行駛上海運輸船六艘焚燬後、始行啟椗駛至東沙角鎭、（該鎮居民稠密、商市發達、為定海縣屬一大市鎭）對出海面、發砲向岸轟擊、金圖登岸、然終以戒備森嚴、</p>
<p>迄未得逞　總計日艦共發砲二十餘發、鐵板沙羊府宮落七彈、大殿正門被毀甚重、附近民房被毀三十餘間、幸居民已趨避一空、僅民人吳阿五一人被擊傷頭部、事後日艦即於四時三十分相率啟椗向衢山方面他駛、現舟山各島秩序已漸决恢復、情形極為安謐、窺日艦發砲用意、似在騷擾後方云、</p>

<h3>恐怖交涉取得諒解　租界局勢鬆弛</h3>
<p>日櫻井司令訪警務處長官密談</p>
<p>工部局與日警合作已趨具體化</p>
<p>日方對於租界恐怖事件之交涉、已於前日提出新照會、表示接受工部局建議、與日警合作、防範恐怖事端績發、故連日緊張這情勢、業已趨於鬆弛緩和、日警備司令櫻井、昨晨會訪工部局警務處長官、會商共同防範辦法、及措施步驟甚久、茲分誌各清如下、</p>
<p>日司令訪問警務處</p>
<p>昨晨十時、日本陸軍警備司令櫻井、率領廣田大佐·陸軍武官·暨武裝憲兵·數十名、分乘取輛、馳至福州路中央捕房、訪謁警務處高級長官、對工部局提出與日警合作防範恐怖事件之問題、有所商談、警務處重要人員、均參與此項談話因性質嚴重、故歷三小時之久、始吿會談完畢、櫻井等直至午後一時許始辭出、會談內容、因關防嚴密、現尚無從探悉、惟信工部局方面取得日警之聯絡、已臻具體化之階段、當會談時、捕房方面、亦加派中西探捕多名、會同隨來之日憲兵等、駐佈門外、從事戒備、以資保護、故昨晨福州路一帶情勢、殊爲緊張、</p>
<p>恐怖交涉吿一段落</p>
<p>據關係方面探悉、工部局收到日方之新照會後、認爲租界恐怖交涉、暫時巳可吿一段落、日方現表示不欲擴大事態、並傾向工部局之主張、贊同與日警取合作態度、繼續防遏恐怖事端、則今後僅須考慮如何措施一點、及與日方磋商各種合作細則、聞工部局頃已將日方照會要點、分別錄出、抄送各議董審核、一俟决定原則、再與日方會談、</p>
<p>西報所傳南京態度</p>
<p>字林報昨載其駐東京特訪員發來電話消息稱、據外務省發言人今日（二十八日）吿余、（訪員自稱）日本願誠摯與上海工部局合作、吾人將靜待以觀工部局所提出之計劃如何實行、吾人切欲將此爭案商妥和諧之解决、吾人願就地與有關係之當局獲得此種解决云、余嘗微求各方面之消息、初以爲日本官方視大局具有可驚之性質、日方提出之要求、必甚嚴厲、乃今竟出以溫和、實出人意料也、於是大衆咸信日木今殊不欲亟亟促成仟何嚴重之糾纷、或使工部局當局之任務、更形棘手、余悉一般當局之態度、爲照字面接受工部局所提出遏制恐怖主義之計劃、而視其如何進行、目前之傾向、至少已認樊克令之覆文爲滿意、但當局仍靜待發展、以視其是吾將再發生糾紛、如果發生者、將决定續取之行動、就余所知、日本要求中並未列有如他方面所傳欲得租界統治權之建議、若照外傳之消息、日本對於租界警權、大有實施强迫之可能性也、</p>
<p>美陸戰隊舉行學習</p>
<p>大陸報云、駐滬美第四海軍陸戰隊士兵、今（一日）晨在普渡路區舉行演習、聞與上海現局並無確切關係、據陸戰隊人員解釋、此等操演、純屬例行性質、但本埠觀察家稱、此時作操演、或使刻正活動於上海區之恐怖份子黨受心理上之影響、自廢暦新年起、日軍在虹口與東區加派之巡　隊、昨（二十八日）巳撤去、日方對此舉、未予解釋、</p>

<h3>昨夜南京路及靜安寺路　爆炸案四起</h3>
<p>幸僅傷人力車夫一名</p>
<p>四案顯係有計劃行動</p>
<p>咋晚九時四十五分至十時五十分之間公共租界南京路中心地段、與靜安寺路跑馬廳畔、竟在一小時中連續發生爆炸案四起、當時空氣頗形緊張、除傷一人力車夫外、幸未釀成慘劇、惟因兩處爆炸物之類同、恐該四案似有速帶關係、刻下正由捕房嚴密偵查中、茲將各情紀述如决、</p>
<p>先施公司</p>
<p>先施樂園大門、設在南京路、而面對英華街者、昨晚九時四十五分左右、當車馬擾攘、遊者正欲賦歸之際，該樂園大門首、沿南京路行人道下、突然發生爆炸聲一響、震驚四鄰、而一般行人等更若大禍來臨、倉皇奔避、於是秩序一度紛亂、該管老閘捕房近在咫尺、早經得訊、立飭大批中西日籍探捕、馳往查勘、並除車輛外、一切行人暫時禁止通行、據悉經探捕等搜索之下、會在馬路沿檢獲三砲台香烟罐碎片、且尚有炸藥餘屑存留、乃將獲物携回捕房存案、至於該罐之來源、據稱係從上面擲下、因此當時警務人員、會入樓上內部搜索、但未有結果、所幸者則未傷</p>
<p>英華街上</p>
<p>當先施樂園門首之案方經查勘完畢之際、不料該英華街上竟又接連發生炸案、時正下午十時十分左右、惟爆炸物已非鐵罐、而爲小型炸彈矣、故其爆力允大、聲響更巨該彈似由天韻樓方面擲下、落於英華街十一號摩登照相館門首、轟然一聲、猶如雷鳴、當時幸行人稀少、故得未釀慘劇、但已有江北人力車夫陳有坤、適在該處兜攬生意、鐵片四飛、遂爲所傷、痛踣地上、呼號不已、探捕等就近得訊、亟亟折往該處查勘、並將受傷之人力車夫、送往醫院救治、事後得悉探捕等曾在該處拾獲彈片數塊、巳送捕房保存、至於搜索結果、則未聞獲有端倪云、</p>
<p>仙樂舞宮</p>
<p>自經上述兩案連續發生後、該南京路上頓時探捕密佈、形勢十分緊張、不抖在探捕等正欲回報捕房、着手研究案情之時、忽又突接警報據稱、在下午十時五十分左右、靜安寺路四百四十四號仙樂舞宮門外、靠近楚霸王廣吿牌地方之行人道上、又有爆炸案發生、於是成都路捕房探捕亦繼之而大批出動、經查勘之下、發覺爆炸者、乃一鐵罐、似與先施樂園一案相類者、幸該處較爲靜僻、故未傷人、所有碎片等、亦已由探捕携回捕房、以憑澈究、</p>
<p>大新公司</p>
<p>當南京路正在擾攘時、　洽卿路南京路口大新公司門首、於下午九時三刻又發生炸彈案一起該彈自何方　下、竟無從探索、但炸力甚大、致當時有停在該處之黑牌汽車租界照會第七九一七號、被彈片炸燬車窗玻璃等、尚幸車內無人、故無傷人情事、此外據傳、當時尚有傳單發現、但記者等趕往時、已被拾一空、據旁人稱、該傳單上所示者、純爲警吿一般沉湎於燈紅酒綠歡舞若在之輩而發署名者爲熱血精神鋤奸團所有彈片、已經捕云、房携回存案、</p>

<h3>三三友朋節　黃警頑致窮友書</h3>
<p>明日（三月三日）爲中國第六次友朋節、照例年有慶祝、以資紀念、發起人黃警頑君、因今年此日仍爲國難嚴重、良友星散、何以爲歡、深望我的愛國朋友、海外僑胞當衆宣誓、不爲奴隸、以人格平等爲唯一目的、多做益世事業、力謀人類幸福、茲探得黃君致內地窮苦朋友書如下、「韶光過得眞快、倏忽又到三月三第六個友朋節了、照例友節是使人</p>
<p>最可慶祝</p>
<p>的、允其在春到人間、和藹可親的時候、不過今年國難仍是萬分嚴重、我們應當保持平日那樣謹愼嚴肅、和積極的當中過去、但是我們如果能睜開眼來一瞧目前的現實、侵略者們的鐵蹄踐踏我們不可數計的鄉土、在他們瘋在的魔手下殘忍的殺害了我們</p>
<p>無數同胞</p>
<p>搶刦去了我們無數的財產、搗毀了我們無可數計的房屋田園、今天幸得避難在孤島上的我們這一羣、雖然能夠度過着這個不算困苦的生活、居然還能自由地迎這個友節、在平時古人猶說居安當思危、在國難嚴重的目前、我們應該怎樣地想到內地的人民苦難、大家都希望自己生命的紀錄變得</p>
<p>燦爛一些</p>
<p>歧途當然是具有靈魂的人所决不願走的、所以只能在精神上求安慰、說幾句吉利話、聊以解嘲、吾心自治、何處不是鍊身之時、忍性之地、修行之資、一切悲歡離合、何一不由心造、在淪陷區做居民、艱難困苦是免不了的、既欲抱定决心不做奴隸、只有逆來順受、咬緊牙關、忍受一切更多大的艱苦、被壓於</p>
<p>利誘勢迫</p>
<p>之下而不屈、偷安享樂、現在根本談不到、失望頽廢、算不起好兒女、精誠所至、金石爲開、希望內地相識窮苦朋友、自救互助、每一處遭到碰壁以後、在每一决受到困厄以後、應耍更深一層的加強你的信念、你有了堅強的信心、叉有服從權威的决心、所以信心和决心、便是相互的信任與權威的承認、</p>
<p>一切成功</p>
<p>都會實現、由於這回苦難中、可以試騐人格的升降、看出究竟誰能眞實地愛國、誰是虛僞愛國祗做表面的工作、內地窮苦的朋友、我想際此快樂的友節、大都無心歡忻、但也不必灰心喪氣、日趨消極、快些振作精神、怎樣的憂勤惕勵、以報祖國、號稱非常時期的現在、身爲受教育的</p>
<p>知識份子</p>
<p>不論做教員·政客·商人·工友·醫·法·工程師·會計師等、多少總該懂得些什麼是本位的責任、不是動聽唱高調喊口號、而是切切實實的幹、我們偏處孤島雖不能赴前綫禦敵和至後方服務、但是做些慈善事業、提倡正當娛樂、服用國貨盡職生產、節的救雞等民衆工作、也何嘗不是愛國、因爲本份報國、和愛國思想、是多方面的、是因時因地而異的、沒有絕對性的、新時代將到臨、願我們窮苦諸好友、準備起新的努力、</p>

<p>全日交易祇五百兩</p>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、形勢驟然轉平、全天僅八元差度、大致則先堅後疲、初開因某金號吸購尙力、故潛勢頗穩、後以突聞平津金價已回降至二千一百六十元關內、若絞滬市僅相差二十餘元、因之北運不劃、致所有尙未出籠均託某錢兌業代爲脫售、故當時雖有某銀樓代本地帮吸購、無如供求頭寸依然懸殊、故爲狀頓時轉疲、結果則軋跌四元、交易匕午僅做開五百兩光景、下午則一無做開、銀樓飾金終日未見更動、海關金曁中英純金等反動上漲、</p>
<p>烚赤價績小四元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開某金號先喊二千一百三十五六元買進、但其時售者頗缺、致難做開、直至十時十分後始見某金號進銀樓帮五十兩、價二千一百三十八元爲開盤價、計高四元、開後金號相同價互做五十兩、此後某錢兌業突來猛塞、致價遂向下游、某錢兌業售予銀樓帮五十兩、價三十五元、後某掮客代平津帮進銀樓帮五十兩、價則相同、繼某錢兌業又售予銀樓帮五十兩、價三十三元、再售予銀樓帮五十兩、價三十二元、（以上所進均補前之所出）、未幾某銀樓忽代本市殷富吸購、進某錢兌業五十兩、價三十四元、後某錢兌業又售予銀樓帮五十兩、價三十一元、繼之相同價銀樓帮互做五十兩、後某錢兌業又售予銀樓帮五十兩、價三十元、時已十一時半許、此後供求轉稀、價亦呆定、迨至午時、未見做開、故午收價仍爲三十元、午後市况更形沉寂、半天毫無做開、惟照上午收盤價仍有人買進、但售者奇缺、若照午收價二千一百三十元、則較上日軋跌四元、全天僅八元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千一百四十元、收進二千一百二十五元、現標金照掛脾金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>首飾金絕無變動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出復平、始終未更、大同行老慶雲等仍懸原價、計爲二百十六元、新同行亦仍二百十四元、收進二百零八九元、</p>
<p>純金回高一便土</p>

<h3>匯豐掛牌　法匯獨縮一法郎</h3>
<p>交易尙旺過程平庸</p>
<p>滙市昨平津外商銀行質各大洋行洋花結款及紗花帮等雖爭先扒結、但因外銀行如匯豐等湧塞、故爲狀依然頗穩、半日間交易尙旺、至港滙雖洋行亦來購結、無如某外銀行供意亦殷、故狀况始終乏變、</p>

<p>華電股票有求無售</p>
<p>證券暗盤、咋日市况疲中帶堅、市上雖仍有做手、擬壓小行市、但多方乘低吸收者亦頗不乏人環境如新借款之成立、公債息票貼現、均將先後置現、西國戰事解决後、中日和平空氣、愈見濃厚、微聞交易所當局、日內赴港、對於復業問題、作具體的商榷、正式開幕、當不在遠矣、市塲上每逢有賣戶壓小行市、多方必乘低吸收、此種手段、暗中競爭甚烈、故前途有鉅大變化也、昨日經過、開盤五號卅八號買進丙種、同康及聯和號亦有相當吸收、市價堅穩、繼以四十六仍有賣出、爲數較多、故意壓小行市、後以散戶及同康天生號以及十五號乘低吸進、稍稍回堅、七落範圍甚小、結果比前日續小一角半至五角半、成交總數的計六七十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>紗花　新春以來第一朝　棉紗成交五千餘包</h3>
<p>須臾間橫跳四元</p>
<p>徘徊幾日之紗市、今得客銷發展之推助、情况復現昭蘇之象、南華滇帮採辦較旺、買去粗細紗計一千二百包外、至於北方細紗生意、雖被他紗侵佔、然粗紗納胃仍强、且繼續購買不絕、於是同業心思、本屬看漲、茲得實需之扶植、市價愈形昂漲、有一部份在市復來爭先收買、漲勢情緒、允見濃烈矣、故二十支雙馬紗開價爲三百九十五元、須臾間即跳五元、爲四百元矣、</p>
<p>査雲南帮買去二十支金鷄紗七百四十包、十支大發二百三十包、市塲人心因之振盪、前途是吾發現新高峰、須依實銷之多寡爲進退也、午後人氣熱烈、一致猛購、雙馬穿出四百元關外、</p>
<p>同業步伐頗紊亂</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤氣勢尙平定、與上日無甚變化、開價勿動、二十支雙馬紗價爲三百九十五元、少頃南方客帮有動辦消息、且有大量胃口、人氣忽緊、市盤步步上升、天津帮粗紗交易亦來購辦、同業大戶將棧單貨吸收不絕、市况由此愈抽愈緊、二十支雙馬收盤價巳至四百元、午後、客方南北兩帮實際交易賡續成交一千餘包、於此同業心意允濃、拖進舉動更形紛繁、市塲價格又見紊亂不一、足見業中人脚步不齊、査本日總成交量有五千〇三十包之鉅、新春以來、爲第一聲之熱鬧、</p>
<p>今日市面有出入</p>
<p>市面旣然上騰、漲風殊激、據市塲言、其中同業鑒於現銷發展、作未雨綢繆之成交極盛旺、二十支雙馬開收盤價差七元七角半、就此狀况論之、現銷如不斷乏、明日還有高價發現、反之、則有回風矣、因多方拉提過力也、査全日成交統計五千○三十包、同行交易佔二千包、行情二十支雙馬比上日價在漲七元七角半、雙地球漲六元、天女漲七元、特金城五元、十支粗紗漲三元、茲將各帮口成交額量如左、</p>

<p>受本國加徵外棉進口稅刺激　印棉基本價高漲</p>
<h3>受本國加徵外棉進口稅刺激　印棉基本價高漲</h3>
<p>蘭開夏代表赴美</p>
<p>商討貸款棉善策</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市因利物浦電訊良好、及盛傳英國紗廠彙集地之蘭開夏各紗廠、頗感美棉短缺、蓋因目前在美能買到者、皆屬美棉之下乘、上乘者早已貸之與政府矣、蘭開夏方面深以購買美棉困難、擬請美政府早日放出此項貸款存貨、特派代表一人、業已首途赴美、與美農部秘書亨利威爾斯商討善策、布疋交易日形轉好、四日來已銷三千六百萬碼之巨、人心爲之一振、紐的棉市連漲已有二週、咋日又漲四至九磅音、印度漲半羅比餘、埃及漲三四磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、前數日因匯兌之未能放鬆、加以海外棉連日步漲、美棉及巴西棉昨日每擔又漲四角、埃及漲三角餘、印政府因印棉之價廉、各國競購尤以上海爲最、致使印度之紗廠、竟有採用外棉之勢、政府深恐此種狀態、不利印國經濟殊甚、特於昨日頒佈命令、更改外棉進口稅則、自三月一日、外棉進口按照原有稅則加倍微收、以示限制、印棉之短纖維者、國內頗呈過剩之象、蓋因產量特多故也、然長織維者、因產額不多、昨日印度來電可充十支至二十支原料之平果兒·奧默拉基本價、每擔漲價半元、然可作二十四支以上原料之白洛區·美種辛特及美種彭加浦等基本價、每擔竟猛漲二元至四元餘、因之昨日外棉交易殊爲靜寂、然據一般觀察、印棉之基本價高漲、或因一時受加徵進口稅之刺激所致、將來或能回跌若干、否則印棉將難於美棉競爭也、茲將昨日棉價折合送廠法幣價、分列於後、</p>
<p>姚花又到　二萬餘件　交易依然寥落</p>
<p>本棉生意依然寥寥無幾、但售價甚堅、良以存貨枯涸之故、茲據棉商云、各路產區次貨存積未罄、然受某方之節制、捐費雜稅旣大、而運輸殊感困難、所以來源一層、前途茫茫、故棉市似復將造成有行無市之局面、蘇北一路來源過燈節後、方有希望、姚花經核准放行、時有到貨、咋由寗波運到二萬六千六百九十八件、茲將現棉成交之額量並市價如左、</p>

<p>貨主乘機居奇扳緊</p>
<p>國米來源河下祇到三號、車運包子二三千包、銷塲因聞海關有將徵進口稅之說、加之到源有限、人心卽昂、大囤戶及本街店胃均屬活潑、售方乘機扳佾、形勢熱鬧、爲今庚之首、結果市面激增、若厚粳行情加一二角、薄稻特別包子飛騰三角、河下貨同高二角、杜洋尖埠尖價格似無上落、而中决已帶好角許、變陰兀去路續旺、乏貨供求、再升二角不等耳、</p>
<p>客秈昨本客行囤納胃均濃、而貨主則有居奇不肯輕脫之意、緣昨河棧粳尖各米一致飛騰外、市上尙有海關將自動解禁、以期避免私述、增加稅收、叉有內地來米將予徵稅云云、上述二說、雖未證實、而人心莫不向上、客秈隨爲各方競辦、全日成交有四千包左右、價比前日上升二尺、南京秈冲羊尖者價至十二元、蕪秈高貨亦至十一元半云、</p>
<p>白米出口、今明兩日有一萬六千包載往寗波、聞尙有三萬四千包待裝云、</p>
<p>粉銷漸呆　本街批價已減五分</p>
<p>粉昨日現粉形勢鬆疲、二號粉廠盤、自紅盤减低五分以來、倐經一週、惟本街批價仍須四元八角、早誌本報、昨市南北兩帮零星點綴、尙不寂寞、而大額成交、巳少接受、本街均以速日洋粉傾銷、及木客廠盤相差五分、竟有非小不受之態、故昨起本客廠盤一律開價四元七角半統市售開二號粉各脾併計三萬包左右、除本街批出七八千包外、其餘悉由烟津福汕等處零星辦去、市面殊鮮興奮、</p>
<p>麥市毫無精釆、來源與存底均感缺乏、廠方前定洋麥、均以船期有誤、到貨有待、致貨方售意甚堅、非漲不脫、惟各廠均有洋麥應用、亦不願放價收辦、市面擯持如故、全市隻包未開、聞塲外有百餘包江北麥成交、價爲六元八角、此批不作正市論、</p>
<p>澳麥績到</p>
<p>萬五千餘噸　明後日進口</p>
<p>近來洋麥陸續運申、上月有德輪Jantze　Fritzen號、由澳洲裝麥八千八百九十三噸來滬、原定上月十九日、即可抵滬、不料至時、非但船未進口、而消息査然、該輪本市代理行怡泰船頭房拍電詢問、亦無回音、事屬離奇、乃於前日二日）忽接該輪來電、謂現赴橫濱裝煤、的明後日即可抵滬、又大英公司Trewellard　號、亦由澳洲裝麥七千餘噸來滬、的明日可進口云、（祖）</p>

<p>但是這决抗戰是長期的、决非短時期內可以結束、收容難民是一時的消極的辦法、不是積極的持久的辦法、况且收容所裹的難民心理、亦大都不願單受消極的救濟、感覺到慚愧不安吧、現在本市難民救濟會、巳經籌募難民生產敎育基金、實施難民生產敎育、創辦難民生產事業、使難民獲得生產知識技能、而實行生產、以自食其力、對國家社會、更可增加生產數量、建設國民經濟、眞是一舉數得、一勞永逸的妥善辦法、我們爲同情於難民、更應同情於難民救濟協會的籌募難民生產較育基金運動、予以實際上的帮助吧、</p>
<p>本會等同人有見於此、想集中我們各學校的教職們同學們的力量、籌募十萬元難民生產敎育基金、以表示我們靑年學生帮助難民同胞的熱忱、所以本會同人、有幾個很懇摯的要求、希望大家努力、</p>
<p>一、各校敎職員節約廢曆新年的費用慷慨捐助爲各校學生倡導、</p>
<p>二、各校學生節約個人費用、並勸吿家庭裏的父母兄弟姊妹們親友們慷慨解囊、踴躍輸將、三、在最短期間、最好在一星期內、各人把自捐捐人的款子、集中起來、購買樂善章、</p>
<p>我們全市有小學生十五萬人、中學生十萬人、大學生及補習學校學生五萬人、有這許多的人數、來籌募十萬元基金不是一定可以成功的事情嗎、本會等同人爲預祝各位的努力和成功、高喊着下面三偭口號、我們互相勉勵吧、（一）　募難民生產敎育基金、是我們眞正愛護難民同胞們的表示、（二）捐助難民生產敎育基金、是我們眞正愛的表示、（三）在一星期內集成十萬元難民敎養基金、是我們在國際觀念所繫的上海來發揮大中華民挨精神的表現、</p>

<h3>上海敎育界　改革敎育意見　對於戰後中等敎育改革的幾點意見（一）  張文昌</h3>
<p>中等敎育因在學制中段、其對象爲最活潑生動之靑年、其功能須兼顧普通敎育與職業敎育、其使命須使學生能升入高等教育機關、同時又須使之具有正常健全之公民資格·態度·觀念與能力、這樣一來、中等學校就難辦了、在其他各國然、在中國更然、因爲敎育爲社會機樣之上層其基礎爲政治·經濟與社會的一切狀况、</p>
<p>中國目採取西洋學制（前淸光緒二十八年、公曆一九○二年）以來、近四十年於茲、學制屢更、效用鮮見、消極者流甚至以爲國家之貧弱、民生之凋疲省由於敎育之故、祇知消費、不事生產、只求表面、不尙實際之故、此種批評雖有一部份之眞理、但也不盡然、世上沒有一個國家政治與經濟不上軌道、而敎育能獨自辦得好者、所以敎育　社會息息相關、致談敎育如何改革、須先看社會之趨勢如何、中等敎育是全部敎育之一環、當然亦不能外此、</p>
<p>戰後中國的狀况如何呢、我們不妨冉預測一下、第一中國神聖的抗戰必得到最後的勝利、第二中國的政治必走上三民主義的共和政體、第三中國的經濟必因大戰後而感到極度困難、需要國際的投資、政府統制的建設與開發、因而大需要多方而建設的人才、第四中國的敎育與文化必因此次抗戰而更發達、而建立一個適應自己需要的教育制度、民衆敎育與基礎敎育（包括初等敎育與中等敎育）必更普及、高等敎育必更實際深入、此爲必然的趨勢、因爲戰後的中等敎育必然有下列的趨勢、（一）學生數必更多、（二）一般家長經濟必更困難、（三）職業敎育必更需要、（四）普通敎育必更求熟練與效率之增加、（五）中等學校必普及於鄉鎭及小城市、故對於戰後中等敎育之改革應注意到下列幾點、</p>
<p>第一因學生數更多、原有校舍不够容納、且現有校舍已有不少被破壊、戰後複興、當然以後校舍之建築須通般籌劃在質的方面但求堅固、不求富麗在量的方面應顧到敎室、圖書室。實騐室與操塲之均衡、使敎室的容量可以容得全校的數量、但圖書室實騐窒與自習室及操塲之容量、又可以容全校之數量、如是則可以試行葛雷制Gary　school　System或Platoon　System使一校可以容一校之學生、使在敎室上課之學生與在圖書室·實騐室·自習室及操塲之學生數量相等、使上課實騐自習、與運動間相輪替、每室每塲無空座、則可以容納加倍之學生、如此比現在上海半日制學校使學生半天在家無聊者好得不知多少、且如此一來、不是單是符號認識與知識貫輸、有技能的訓練更有體格的鍜鍊、有上課更有指導之自習、則應乎可稱爲完全的敎育、（未完）</p>

<p>衣食住行　食的專頁</p>
<h3>蔣委員長的食</h3>
<p>— 水鳥</p>
<p>一個人，飲食起居有規律，就能增强他的體魄。蔣委員長從來不因他的地位的尊榮，而妄飲妄食，漫無節制。他每晨六時起床，做過許多修養工作後，於七時半始進早餐；早餐品極爲簡單，也不過中國人一向習食的粥類及若干鷄蛋和幾碟蔬菜而已。他對於有刺戟性的飲料，如咖啡茶葉，都不歡喜服用，因恐損害身體和心臟。他的午餐時間，大的在每日中午十二時半，除常時有其夫人宋美齡女士作陪之外，間也有高級軍政人員，及外交代表等陪侍。他日常的菜餚，多爲中菜，每决所用，也不過五六味罷了。在每一星期中，也偶然用及西菜，但是也非常簡單，不過四道至六道，而且都是偏重於蔬食類的。他用晚膳的時間，平均在每晚七時半至八時之間，其菜餚和午餐時彷彿。在他每食之後，水果如橘子等是常備的副食，也因爲此等水果有助於消化；同樣理由，他最嗜中國的白菜。惟對於酒類，無論其爲中國陳酒，抑或洋酒，則十餘年來，絕未飲用·據說，即如葡萄酒類的飲料，也只有在他與宋美齡女士結婚時欽過一决。至於如一般人好在飯後，燃煙消遺，這在蔣委員長也是沒有的。他在爲勵志社所寫的戒條裏，就吿誡着軍人「不吸煙！不飲酒！」叉在他近幾年提倡新生活運動中所揭示的，也有不吸煙，不飲酒的勸勉：而他自己處處能以身作則，這是更可給我們做模範的！</p>
<h3>吃的衛生</h3>
<p>— 醫師張文華</p>
<p>胃腸病在中國的猖獗，較之肺結核實在是有過之而無不及。所謂病從口入，對於胃腸病實在是再確切也沒有的了。食物的要揀易於消化，不傷腸胃這固然人人都知道的。可是，要如何才不傷腸胃呢？人們沒有完全歐化那樣的喜吃生菜已是避免了不少麻煩：要知道種植的肥田粉還不能普遍於中國，依然是用那含有多數蟲卵的糞便，還好習慣上是煮熟了吃的，可是這樣還不能就此高枕無憂，你還得戒除剌激品的嗜好，像胡椒辣椒酸醋等。少吃固然能促進你的食慾，在久吃之後，你的冒就無形中受了損傷，不是嗎？你久後就覺得吃東西非它不可，沒有，就簡直食不下咽，實在，無形中你的食慾反在减退，反之，就是食慾異常地在增進着，這足見胃酸的分泌已因你的不時加以刺激而增加，食物固然很容易消化，（就是鹽酸的腐化作用，）而你的胃粘膜也就同樣地遭到腐蝕而形成潰瘍；這是如何的可怕呀！雖然在治療上已有了特效的方法，可是對於你精神上巳有很大的影響哩！再說到食物的溫度，人們從來就知道生冷的東西不宜吃，而太熱了，也同樣的不宜。冷的足使胃粘膜貧血而减少胃酸分泌，以致食物不易消化，太燙的呢？能使胃粘膜充血而分泌增多，結果，是和嗜食刺戟品遭到同樣的不幸，國人的喜歡「趁熱吃，」允其像鍋巴湯一類的非燙不鮮，簡直是一個太壊的惡習慣，對個人健康與國家前途，都有英大的關係。（却酬）</p>
<h3>一舉成名的黃橋燒餅</h3>
<p>— 曙霞</p>
<p>南京國府路上，有一家黃橋燒餅店，這店的老　是泰與黃繙人，他就把他故　的「地名」，當做他店舖的「字號」，他店裹出品的燒餅，也把「黃橋」二字命名。</p>
<p>黃橋曉餅和普通的「大餅」形式相仿，不過內容不同，它和「海殼餅」一樣的鬆脆，並且的東西，因此他每天早晨，都要着僕役去買幾隻充飢，不久，國府的一般公務員，也多仿行購買，因此黃橋燒餅就代替了大餅油條，充滿了國府的辦公室。這樣一傳十，十傳百，有豆沙或是榨菜肉絲包在裏面，所以吃起來比「海殼餅」來得有味，價錢很便宜，每隻祇賣三分錢。這店鋪就在我母校的臨近，所以我差不多是那裏的老主顧。</p>
<p>後來不知怎樣？這種黃橋燒餅，會給我們的兀首林主席吃到，他很贊美這種價廉物美黃橋燒餅的義務廣吿，在極短的時期內，已經傳遍了全城，大家都來購買。因此黃橋燒餅的銷路大廣，這位老　也漸漸地發起財來。</p>
<p>經過這决的變亂以後，不知道這位幸運兒—黃橋燒餅店還能安然的存在嗎？</p>
<p>吃補品的先生們！請你想想窗外的難民呀！</p>
<h3>成都的食</h3>
<p>— 納爵</p>
<p>在戰前；成都是一個很幽雅，安閒，舒適的社會，所以在任何一條街上，總可以找得出一二家茶坊菜館，而且是「坐上客常滿，杯中茶不空。」</p>
<p>據民國廿三年的調査統計；成都住戶有八萬二千一百七十七戶，人口總數計四十三萬八千九百九十五人，而成都全市的飲食業戶曾有六千五百五十二家。至於街頭的飲食　販，還不在統計中。假使我們把人口數和飲食業戶做一個比例，足證成都飲食事業的特殊發達。現在成都口成後方的重鎭，人口激增到六十萬左右，那麽飲食業戶，想來更見繁榮。</p>
<p>成都一般茶坊菜館的招牌，也够別緻；極小的茶園，竟稱「涴　」。很尋常的菜館，竟大言不慚的呌「味腴」。小飯店題名「臨時維持生活處」，倒也是事實。賣豆乳的呌「萬里橋邊賣乳家一，賣酒的小店呌「不醉無歸小酒家」，多麽富有詩意。</p>
<p>「姑姑筵」是成都最負盛名的一家菜館；主人黃晋齡素精烹調，從前做過知府，現在由仕途退隱；率全家在成都開設飯館。黃老年近七旬，矯健和壯年人一般，一切均由自已動手，技藝超羣，使成都人士，都以假座姑姑筵宴客爲風雅闊綽。那裏的菜價，自然比衆高貴，可是生意興隆，每天定席一空；最令人驚異的，是不准座客隨意點菜。</p>
<p>黃老藏書萬卷，放下鏟刀，就一卷在手；每年自撰滑稽春聯一副。現在轉錄三聯，以見他的風趣，也是飲食界的佳話（一）「可憐吾六十年讀書，還是當厨子。做得來廿二省味道，也要些工夫」·（二）「做些魚翅燕窩，歡迎各位老爺太太。落點殘湯賸飯，養活我們大人娃娃一。（三）「由鍋邊鎭守使加封燉煨將軍，這個好頭銜，硬比他們闊氣。有廟上李老君保佑飲食菩薩，今年開花市，該顯一點神通。</p>
<h3>加拿大一胎五女的食料</h3>
<p>— （恕齋）</p>
<p>加拿大一胎五女的誕生，是近幾年來最能轟動全世界的一件事，許多物品商都把伊們的名字拿來做商標，影片公司也特地將伊們的日常生活攝入鏡頭，而各國的報章雜誌，更大書特書的替伊們宣傳。同時，全世界的人們都在關心伊們的起居：衣食住行。</p>
<p>這裹，就讓我來吿訴你一些關於伊們一天所吃的東西，同時，請做媽媽的注意，如果要使子女身體康健，除了注意食料中的澱粉質外，還得多吃含有礦物質和維他命的東西。因爲加拿大的一胎五女，都因爲常吃這種有豐當滋養料的食品，才能活潑康健啊！</p>
<p>下面是伊們每天的食料表：</p>
<p>上午六點半！四盎士的橘子和魚肝油。</p>
<p>上午八點十分！一個雞蛋，一大薄片塗着牛油的麵包，蕃薯粉的餅吃，以及五盎士的牛奶。</p>
<p>下午四點！二片塗着牛油的薄麵包以及含有酸素的牛奶。</p>
<p>下午四點半！番茄汁和着魚肝油。</p>
<p>下午六點！麥片粥，四到五盎士的牛奶麵包和牛油。</p>
<p>（除了普通的牛奶外，每個孩子在餐前有小量含酸素的牛奶，總共有二十盎士左右）</p>
<p>以上的食料表是看護伊們的達福醫生定的。</p>
<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>春節期間，吃了許多肥魚大肉，也許覺得太油膩了吧；所以很需要淸淡些的東西來調劑一下。星期一的菜單中，我就配了兩樣淸淡的菜，一樣是鷄絲拌水芹，一樣是蛤蜊鯽魚湯，大的會對你的胃口的。歲尾年頭，鷄價飛漲，每隻三斤多的鷄，總要四元左右，眞使人食指不敢動了。不過祭祖祀神以及宴請親友，總還少不了它，就要忍痛買它一二隻，要是節省些的話，那麼白鷄也許還有留下一些，就可把它擘做了絲，和水芹同拌了。水芹必須用沸水泡過，加醬麻油或麻醬同拌，吃起來，很爲適口。要是沒有鷄，那就用較瘦的肉絲爲代，再加些蛋皮絲在內，未爲不可。至於蛤俐價格並不貴，買十多隻來和鯽魚一同淸燉，可以增加它的鮮味的。</p>
<p>星期一　鷄絲拌水芹　蛤蜊鯽魚湯　醋溜銀絲芥　淸炒小幢菜</p>
<p>星期二　咖哩牛肉　淸燉鳊魚　蝦子豆腐　炒塔窠菜</p>
<p>星期三　菜花炒肉片　雪菜小黃魚　筍衣綫粉湯　生邊金花菜</p>
<p>星期四　紅燒羊肉　生煎帶魚　淸炒菜心　紅燒蘿蔔　　星期五　薺菜炒肉絲　紅燒明蝦片　蝦子炒麵筋　葱油蘿蔔絲　　星期六　油豆腐嵌肉　紅燒小鱖魚　雪菜燒豆腐　豆苗炸筍片</p>
<p>星期日　獅子頭　荷包蛋　炒菠菜　黃豆芽</p>

<h3>勵行不合作</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>除非是漢奸，否則誰也不會與敵人合作吧。</p>
<p>漢奸畢竟是絕少數人，所合作的，舉竟也無甚顯著的成效，道是抗戰開始到現在，我們可引以自慰的。</p>
<p>然而我現在却有一個杞憂：在絕對不是漢奸的同胞中，却有人無形中與敵人合作，潛長了敵人的勢力。我不能不抉出這一個趨勢，籲求我們同胞，勵行不合作，來阻止那可能的惡影響，以及萬一的毒果。</p>
<p>無形的合作中，最普遍的是向敵人領通行證。這是什麽話：我們在自己的土地上行走，要向他們領通行證！當然，去領通行證的人，並非不愛國，而所以要領通行證的緣故，也自有其不得巳的苦衷。但是我們想一想：這與承認他們的主權，作他們的順民，有什麽兩樣？久而久之，誰又說得定不視爲當然，成爲習慣，而忘却自己的本來面目呢？誰又說得定他們不因此挾以自重，而作更進一步的利用呢？至於向他們領取此項通告證，並施用此項通行證時所受的種種痛苦，精神的與肉體的，還是小焉者也，早巳足以使人疾首蹙　了。</p>
<p>此外，在游舉區中，據種種傳聞，不免也有並非漢奸之流。而向敵人請求伸寃理枉者，請求某種似乎無關大局之便利者。這樣的舉動，我認爲也是與敵人在無形中合作，要助長敵人的勢力。</p>
<p>我以爲我們在現在，不論在公私任何事項上，只有對和敵人不往來，才可以免除與之合作的嫌疑。即使萬不得已，別無他法可想，有偶一爲之的必要，也當竭力减少其决數。其他任何事項，總之不要和他們打交道，才是道理。吃自己人的虧，蝕氣與自己人，總比受敵人的優待好，　况他們澈底不會優待我們呢！</p>
<p>擺倫「哀希臘詩」中會說，「只要是自己人，就是暴君也不要緊！」我籲求我們的同胞，三復斯言！</p>
<h3>老禿  丁諦</h3>
<p>槍聲從四面兜攏，更近，更猛，也更密了。</p>
<p>流彈從高空落地，嗤大塘邊落下一顆，沾着濕泥，沒爆炸：磆碌碌，幾個筋斗，攪起一陣泥漿。</p>
<p>帶着了一臉泥，小禿子跑回家。</p>
<p>「打仗了！打仗了！××鬼子打到村上來啦！」</p>
<p>立刻恐怖的手揑緊了全一福鎭人的心，心是弱小的，而恐怖却是那麽大那麽深。</p>
<p>幾個鎭定慣了的人開口了：</p>
<p>「你們不要慌！××兵一定是來剿遊擊隊，我們老百姓保沒有危險。」</p>
<p>「唉！你不要說這些廢話啦！」</p>
<p>「我們快點躱喲！躱喲！你們有年少男女的快躱！」</p>
<p>躱到那兒去？一時三刻呢，瓜棚邊，圩岸底，牛東下，草堆中……</p>
<p>王老禿是不躱的。小禿們鑽進草堆去了，仲出頭來，招招手，他不睬。搦出一枝早烟管，坐下來，悠閑地，他抽着烟。</p>
<p>院子裏，靜靜的，沒有人聲。屋前屋後，一片竹林。響起脚步聲，在遠遠田塍上。近了，近了，抬起頭，竹葉抖了抖，彷彿一陣風，颼颼，颼颼，—是人吧—被逍趕的人呢？</p>
<p>啊！一頭血！帶了傷的人！</p>
<p>「你你你—」</p>
<p>「老先生！快！快！請你給我們躱一躱！後面××兵來了！」</p>
<p>一共是兩個人，都帶了傷呢！看他們身上的手槍，老禿曉得他們是遊擊隊。他立刻答應了，「可以可以」。結果兩個帶傷的人被掩藏到草堆裏。</p>
<p>沈寂後的騷擾，蠕動了，在全福鎭。</p>
<p>馬蹄聲，呶駡聲，鞭笞聲，乞憐聲，哭泣聲，……</p>
<p>搜査，搜查，挨門逐戶的搜査，這輪到老禿頭上了，老禿搖搖頭，裝傻。</p>
<p>「那兩個遊擊隊，到你們村上來的，快交出！你不說，他們就要打死你！」</p>
<p>「翻譯」吿訴老頭。老禿搖搖頭，也不說甚麽。</p>
<p>從馬上跳下一個小軍官，他用槍柄用勁敲他禿頭。老禿眼睛楞大了；他不能忍耐。</p>
<p>「媽的，老子給誰打過？狗養的！你佔咱便宜！咱們拚命！」</p>
<p>一拳頭回送給軍官，眼鏡片碎了，軍官氣得在呌。老禿立刻被綁起，雙手反綁樹上。</p>
<p>「一定是這狗蛋藏的。遊擊隊只消問他就得啦。」</p>
<p>軍官點點頭。老禿的衣服被剝脫了。</p>
<p>鞭笞，鞭笞，膀子上皮膚變紫了，發腫了。鞭笞，鞭笞，血一滴滴流下。溫然，鮮紅。……</p>
<p>「你交出遊擊隊來，我們就饒你命。」</p>
<p>老禿咬緊牙齒，準備忍受一切的刑罰。</p>
<p>刺刀刺着自己的手心，痛得不能忍耐；他流淚了。</p>
<p>地下的血紫了，一雙手滿是淋漓。他依然是倔強。</p>
<p>「你交出那兩個人，不好嗎？—免得自己吃苦。」</p>
<p>「翻譯」帶着憐憫心勸解。但老禿却不高興聽。他搖搖鞭腫了的頭，昂然仰視，披開嘴，苦笑了。</p>
<p>「這算甚麽！我怕嗎？哼！你們殺死我，用刀，用槍，聽便。要我招供，夢想！」</p>
<p>這時小禿從草堆中溜出來，跪在老禿面前。</p>
<p>「你說吧！你交出人好了……再不說你性命……嗚喲……你性命……嗚嗚鳴……嗚啊……」</p>
<p>啊！赤裸的身軀，血肉的狼藉，鞭打的創痕；那是他可憐的爸爸啊！他哭·他酸心·他要他爸爸招供，因爲招供才可免刑·</p>
<p>但老禿决不聽這些，一脚踢開小禿。</p>
<p>「是好兒子，替我報仇。硬掙些，才是漢子！你爸爸老了，死，是時候！快滾回去！」</p>
<p>這是老禿的聲音。</p>
<p>彌留了，—勝利的愉快驅散痛苦的　攣。</p>
<h3>「酷愛和平者」的出遊</h3>
<h3>木蘭從軍</h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>—民族小說話</p>
<p>木蘭的故事，最早的記戰當然是「木蘭詩」，見樂府詩集卷二十五。關於這首詩的時代，聚訟紛紜，十年前徐巾舒等在東方雜誌上曾經有過幾决熱烈的討論，直到前年，還有曲瀅生繼續的研討·徐中舒斷定木蘭詩是初唐與盛唐之間的作品，姚大榮則以爲應屬隋末唐初；這兩種說法都與後來小說的說法相同。</p>
<p>接着便是唐代韋元甫的續詩，樂府詩集云：「浙江西道觀察使兼御史中永韋元甫續附入。」中有警句云：「親戚持酒賀父母，始知生女與子同。」</p>
<p>此後詠木蘭的詩想來不少，惟戲劇方面似乎到了明代，纔有徐文長寫過一種雜劇「雌木蘭」，多據原詩敷衍，想像分子甚少。</p>
<p>直到淸初，纔有褚人穫的「隋唐演義」揷寫一段木蘭，第五十六回爲「代從軍木蘭孝父」，第五十九回爲「奇女子鳳閣沾恩」。另外添出一個妹妹花又蘭，與羅成相戀，寫來頗爲旖旎，似比花木蘭寫得更爲成功。</p>
<p>淸光緒十九年纔有品文堂刊本的「忠孝勇烈奇女傳」四卷三十二回，這也就是本文所要說的「木蘭從軍」了。「木蘭從軍」是坊間代改的書名。此賽文白夾雜，故事純爲揑造。稱木蘭詩爲李靖作，又夾雜了許多道士成仙的話，極爲可哂。中間穿插隋唐間韓擒虎實建德尉遲恭褚遂良等事，直到第八回朱木蘭方纔降生。據修慶氏原序所說，則是根據「後唐書」的。此書不曾見過；但査新舊唐書，則旣無木蘭，亦無朱木蘭，大的是作者隨意揑造故事，再捏造書名引以自重的吧？</p>
<p>淸末劉申叔（中古文學史著者）作亂彈「木蘭從軍」，最近「閒書」雜誌會重刋一次，增出小丑爲木蘭的堂兄，不敢打仗，於是木蘭挺身願往，故意拿懦怯來襯託勇敢。唱句甚好；惟過於文雅，似非一般人所能了解，且因無經騐之故，故造句多生拗難於上口，反不及梅蘭芳所演的那一本。</p>
<p>梅蘭芳的「木蘭從軍」收入戲考第二十九冊。據北平國劇學會圖書館書目面二二，云此劇爲齊如山所作。差不多完全根據木蘭詩原作，引子與下塲詩甚至巧妙的引用原句。如木蘭云：「萬里赴戎機，關山度若飛。朔氣侵雙鬢，寒光照鐵衣。」僅改三字。又云：「歸來見天子，天子坐明堂。」木蘭弟云：「磨刀霍霍向豬羊。」警句亦多，如木蘭之母阻其夫花弧從軍，花弧云：「我想當兵，乃人人應盡義務。如果大家存了個怕死的心，只圖安樂，不救國雞，國家要這百姓何用！我雖然上了些年紀，自問還能一戰，就是戰死沙塲，也留下一個好男兒的榜樣，何怕之有？」後來木蘭之母又阻止木蘭，木蘭也說：「我想爲國分憂，男女都是一樣。倘然一國之中，都要靠男子，女子豈不是廢物了？况且照歷史看來，古今女子，領兵殺賊的，也多得很呢。」最後又云：「女子若肯立志，也同男子一樣。」</p>
<p>是的，女子也同男子一樣，最近不是廣西陝西都有女子從軍麽？文人如謝冰瑩胡蘭畦胡萍黎明健等輩，不也是出入於戰塲而有報吿文藝的寫作麽？</p>
<h3>我不能不想</h3>
<p>— 冷眼</p>
<p>讀本刋一月二十五日路弓先生的大作「最好你不要想」，雖然他後面說：「向前走吧，我勸你，前面另有新天地，」意思是要我們努力抗戰，不要沾戀家鄉，却很易引起人家的誤會，所以我另外寫了遺首詩，以爲補充。</p>
<p>你呌我最好不要想，</p>
<p>這祇好呌你遭受個失望。</p>
<p>朋友，美麗的家鄉，</p>
<p>無論如何我不能不想。</p>
<p>雖然目前被敵人毀做了墳塲，</p>
<p>田園中長着沒膝的針芒，</p>
<p>那十多年的老屋，</p>
<p>祇剩幾根支柱東倒西橫，</p>
<p>然而，我决不顧白白送給敵人受享。</p>
<p>聽吧，「打回老家去」的歌聲，</p>
<p>唱得震天價響，</p>
<p>大家都在一心一德，</p>
<p>努力着恢復我們的家鄕。</p>
<p>我們要使靑白的旗幟，</p>
<p>在家鄉自由的飄蕩；</p>
<p>我們要埋下新中國的種子，</p>
<p>在家鄕發揚滋長；</p>
<p>我們要消除敵人留下的汚點，</p>
<p>使家鄉重又光明！</p>
<p>朋友，努力吧，</p>
<p>我們每個人都在血潮怒漲，</p>
<p>我們决不願甘心做亡國奴的好夢。</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>七　變端</p>
<p>從來說「好景不常」，大家都把合浦鎭當做世外桃源，却不知世上本無桃源，更何况在全面抗戰時期，不論什麽都和抗戰有關，要想脫身事外，優游自在，無疑地是不可能的。</p>
<p>合浦鎭的世外桃源的地位，漸漸的受了外來的影響，不復能維持下去了。這外來的影響倒不是×軍，而是一種土匪隊伍。原來葉團長所帶的部隊不足兩營，步哨雖然放得遠，却不能完全控制住所有的村鎭，於是在他力所不及的地方，便有土匪乘機崛起。這些土匪，居然也假冒着什麽隊的名義，其中最强盛的一股，出現在合浦鎭東南的苕溪鎭上，首領呌李小猫，大家因爲他瞎了隻眼睛，却呌他做獨眼李。</p>
<p>獨眼李本是個鹽梟，做了二期首領後，分外無惡不作，到處據人勒噴，使得一般清白良民，水深火熱，痛苦萬狀。他一面又和敵人暗通聲氣，在他勢力範圍內設立捐卡，徵收各種貨物的落地捐和過境稅，並成立徵租處，不管佃戶們有沒有能力，每石租稻都得徵收一元三角的畝捐。此外，如包銷鴉片嗎啡等毒物，包庇納捐的財塲等，更是大宗收入。不過他雖然無法無天，對於合浦鎭却不敢輕犯，因爲他深知葉團長所領導的正規游擊隊實力很强，遠非他所能敵。</p>
<p>葉團長對於獨眼李的種種劣跡，也時有所聞，不過一來因爲抱着「中國人不打中國人」的宗旨，二來希望他們能够悔過自新，也未始不是代國家保全實力之道，三來恐怕把他們逼得急了，會去投降敵人，爲虎作倀，所以他始終只是隱忍不發。無奈在獨眼李勢力範圍內的民衆，實在受不住痛苦，紛紛來向葉團長訴寃，吿白如雪片般飛來，葉團長未便坐視不理，於是就在鄉公所裹召開了一次緊急軍事會議，商量怎樣對付這批無法無天的土匪。</p>
<p>除了有兩位大隊長駐防在外沒有出席以外，其他的人都到齊了。葉團長在席上把獨眼李的種種罪惡，約略報吿了一遍，便開始徵求各人的意見。（二二）</p>

<h3>談崑劇中之笑（上）</h3>
<p>— 媽紅香院主</p>
<p>崑劇中之笑，因劇情之各異，而有種種之分，苟研究不善，或有背劇情，雖有佳妙之唱做，皆被湮沒，其關係與劇中之藝術極大也。一</p>
<p>笑之與劇情之關係旣如是，故習者不可不加以深切之硏究，且更須自具慧心，加以體貼揣摹，就票界言，笑之佳者絕少，蓋偶以串戲爲消遣，無故學笑，類似瘋在，於是咸棄而不學，其工夫自較藝者爲不精矣笑之硏究法可分爲三，茲以劇情分別其種類，略舉數例如下：</p>
<p>一　分類</p>
<p>喜笑類　微笑　暢笑　狂笑　嬌笑</p>
<p>非喜笑類　譏笑　憤笑慘笑　病笑　徉笑</p>
<p>（微笑）如飯店劇中之周羽云。。「且喜今日又有了安身之處了」（生）</p>
<p>（暢笑）如前劇周羽云「當眞，果然」時。</p>
<p>（狂笑）如絮閣中明皇下塲時之小生，又如說親中田氏聞蒼頭云「若要娶妻須要像夫人這樣標標緻緻」時。（旦）（且之狂笑亦可謂蕩笑）</p>
<p>（嬌笑）如佳期中紅娘使張生見鶯鶯時，（貼旦）又如長亭及閙學中，貼之嬌笑甚多，蓋多形容解事之小鬟也。</p>
<p>（譏笑）如棋盤會劇中宜王見白狼放聲大笑時，（凈）蓋譏楚國之以猿作相也。</p>
<p>（憤笑）如打車中程淳云「好個萬戶侯吓）（生）（慘笑與病笑）如痴夢中之崔氏，至於臨下塲時之笑，蓋已積失希望慚愧之心於胸中，將成痴狂，故爲病笑，與普通之笑特異也。</p>
<p>（佯笑）如小宴劇中之王允，聞呂布改稱岳父大人即放聲縱笑，實乃佯笑也。</p>
<p>以上分九種，自不免有所遺漏，但以生旦凈等色分之，已有數十種之多，實際上或可應用矣。</p>
<p>二　聲音</p>
<p>凡生之微笑，如有聲則極低緩，旦則無聲，丑可隨使，惟須帶幾分滑稽意味。</p>
<p>（暢笑）生作「哈哈哈」其每個音之長短比例爲3:2:1。其每個大小之比例亦相同，在笑則略相似，須輕在放輕薄氣。</p>
<h3>漫談陳雲裳</h3>
<p>— 聶格自港寄</p>
<p>南國影星陳雲裳應聘上海新華公司　主演古裝片「木蘭從軍」，這是激起了上海香港兩地人仕刮目相看的，現在我們就來介紹這位幸運的紅星于讀者之前，使讀者諸君對她得到一個明晰的印象與認識。</p>
<p>陳雲裳崛起于華南影壇是去年的事，但她從事影業的歷史也只有二年半，民國二十六年她從廣州來香港，開始投身影界，第一個給她認識的是香港的紅導演蘇怡。蘇適在籌備「新靑年」一片，缺少一女主角，便大胆地選她來扮演，這女主角是「個天眞未泯的鄉村女孩子，片成，她是成功了。接着，她在大觀公司湯曉丹（前上海天一公司佈景師現亦爲香港紅導演之一）導演下演了「金屋十二釵」正續兩集，「花開富貴」諸片，於是聲譽日高，到去年，在司徒慧敏導演主演了「血濺寳山城」一片後，遂躍上了第一流的紅星地位了。</p>
<p>她與香港一個也很有地位的導演瞿然，比較親近，自在瞿導演下演過「天下爲公」一片，兩人大有形影不離之概，這可拿近事來一說，陳去滬後，她的那部小汽車現在爲瞿君每日駕駛了，報章上過去登過她們不少「艷麗新聞」，她們見了也不吾認，也不承認。</p>
<p>明星的地位一高，架子也就大了，陳雲裳在港各公司拍戲時，除了她母親陪她不離一步外，還有兩個「娘姨」跟着服侍她，一個提着吃食品和衣物化妝品，一個專倒茶替巾。忙個不停。天熱時，在背後替她拂扇，驕矜得令人感到她太做作了雖然她是很客氣對付一般的人。</p>
<p>陳雲裳的眞名字是呌陳民强，在廣州時，她已在廣州影片公司演過了「粉碎姑蘇台」，「唐宮綺夢」，兩部歷史古裝片，前片飾越后，後片飾「楊貴妃」。</p>
<p>在廣州未演片之前，她是一個廣州歌舞團的一員，那時還只有十三歲。常在先施遊樂塲，大新遊藝塲登台，後來加入了一個藝術研究會的「素社」，學習京粤曲劇，始立下了今日成名的基礎。</p>
<h3>遊藝珍聞</h3>
<p>黃金大戲院坤且章遏雲，因病嗓不能登台，昨日　　臨時回戲，當局决定給假三天。</p>
<p>上海伶界聯合會以國際救濟會爲該會保管難民區房產，厥功甚偉，現由常務委員潘宏動發起，擬演唱會戲募款捐助該會。</p>
<p>大舞台後台藝員，對伶聯會勸募認養難民，均捐助包銀一成，台柱張翼鵬前曾單獨捐五十元，現又再捐二十五元，熱心慈善，良堪欽佩。</p>
<p>武生張竹軒昨接其父桂芬目重慶寄來家報，稱於正月初三日偕趙如泉，趙君玉赴昆明演唱，待以售款所得，接全體藝員入滇。今年三四月間可以返滬，竹軒得此函後，大爲欣慰。</p>
<p>卡爾登大戲院移風劇社小生葛次江，昨日對記者表示，外傳其將隨坤旦金素琴於今日赴港，完全不確，因金雖曾與之接洽，本人實不願離滬。</p>
<p>泰山粤劇團晚離更新舞台後，將出演皇后劇院。已在談判條件中，頗有成局希望。</p>

<h3>舊劇前途的展望（四）</h3>
<p>— 迂堂</p>
<p>拿舊劇來比作一件骨董，似乎最爲適黨，古代陶器在當初製造的時候，原是一些瓶整盌罐之類的日用器皿，湮沒了幾千年，一旦出土，到了現代人的手中，有的便從這上面懐想古人的生活狀况；有的硏究它的質地的優劣，色澤與花紋；有的朝夕拂拭，視同拱璧；或是送到博物館裹什襲珍藏。沒有人再拿來用作盛物的器皿了。舊劇的情形，正也相似：當初編劇上演大都有揚善抑惡循環果報等等。良好的動機用來感化觀衆。後來反覆排演扮演的伶人不住變更，演劇的效果也各自不同，如甲伶演得最好，乙伶稍差，丙伶演得不好；叉如某伶是活諸葛，某伶是活曹操活張飛之類。此種情形變本加厲，使舊劇的性質很自然的從人生的藝術傾向爲藝術的藝術與當初編演戲劇的主旨離開得很遠。降至今日危坐在台下一本正經看戲掉淚的，便被譏爲替古人擔憂的傻子；反是那些專在注意着伶人的眼神手法，或是閉目凝神，在辨別字之尖團陰陽，腔之抑揚頓挫之輩，却算作眞正的舊劇欣賞者。此種演變，我們可以看出舊劇是以技巧爲主體，而劇情意識反退居於無足輕重的地位。一齣戲不論情節如何荒誕，祇要扮演的伶人做得好唱得好，這齣戲便可稱爲名刺，而擁有廣大的觀衆。過去不是有好多無人問津的冷戲，呌譚鑫培等唱紅的麽？同樣，一個意識很前進的劇本，假如讓劣角去扮演，决不會有良好的效果，可以斷言。聲如明末遺恨一劇，劇本很好，周信芳演來，相當動人；他的徒弟演來，差些勁兒：劣角演來，就一無可觀，邊論效果。陶在東先生論捉放劇本，以爲大不妥善，確具卓見。不過捉放一劇，是譚鑫培唱紅了的，他在本釗中的一腔一字，一舉手，一投足，都已成了今日伶人的典型範本，學得像便算對，學得不像便算不對，不要說伶人不敢輕加更易，就是自命爲學識在伶人之上的票友，也因思想被演技的繩索所束縛，而沒有勇氣加以竄改。關於此層可舉幾個例：十八扯小放牛小上墳這類小戲，根本談不到什麽意識，劣角演來，使人昏昏欲睡；可是讓演技成熟了的花且小丑扮演，確可百看不厭。</p>
<h3>小掌故　眞假楊小樓</h3>
<p>— 詩味軒</p>
<p>梅畹華第二决到南通，與楊小樓同行，當時南通市面，已不若畹華首决來通之盛，然張嗇公優遇畹華，可謂至厚，濠南別業之東苑，有樓數楹，曰花竹平安館，後憑濠河，前臨博物院，風景幽雅，嗇公特闢爲畹華下榻之所，而將小樓寄宿於査伶家中。小樓以待遇異殊，意有不懌，及出演更俗劇塲，南通人士渴慕小樓名，傾城往觀，詎知小樓爲北泯武生，與南派之作風，本不相同，而通人初不識北派之妙處，加之小樓意興索然，不肯賣力，以致全劇精神渙散，漫無精彩，於是通人一唱百和，胥曰是乃假楊小樓。適被嗇公聞悉，一日語畹華曰：「我爲更俗劇塲撰聯中有句曰，「眞者猶假，假何必非眞。」不想今日適爲小樓詠也。</p>
<h3>埋頭苦幹的『田心』</h3>
<p>— 許燕芳</p>
<p>處女作「甜心」不日公演</p>
<p>田心原名張枬孜，民十八供職江寗縣政府，十九年仟職上海市財政局，及公安局，後與馬二先生（馮叔鸞）結合，迨戰事爆發，馮忽變節，田痛恨之餘，逮而離去。去幾會一度加入惲子謙主辦之大中華話劇團，先係客串性質，豈科在「雷雨」中大獲成功（田飾繁漪）遂由客串而至正式下海。後大中華全班人馬統往綠竇，田亦即一躍而爲主角，與范雪朋女七稱雄一時，頃間田於演戲之餘，摒除一切無聊應酬，埋首編寫劇本，其處女作定名「甜心」，刻正着手編寫對白中，因其素具根底：成功當爲意料中事，不久「甜心」演出於舞台之日，定下轟動一時也。</p>

<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（二七）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>吃戲飯也並不是件容易的事，允其是故都的梨圍行，自從有精忠廟起，像甚麽廟首啦，梨園公會會長啦，在從前都有很大的權威，來統制會中一切的事務。科班繁盛的時代，凡是坐科的弟子，等到幾年滿師，出科演戲，無形中就算得到一張畢業文憑，隨便到甚麽地方演唱，那都是很光彩的，所以科班出來的伶人，就無須經過拜師的禮節啦。</p>
<p>倘若有那位外行人想吃這碗戲飯，這可是樁極困難而極受排擠的事兒，別說你輕易挿不進去，卽令你會鑽營，托人把你介紹給某人磕頭，算是入了這個鬥檻啦。但你所拜的這位貴老師，要是沒有甚大的名氣，或是有名氣而偏不肯照應你，那也是在戲班裏吃不開的。</p>
<p>十年前我在北平灌音，由臥雲居士，董峻峯兩位伶工介紹我一個唱小花臉的票友名呌王華甫的。他們極力讀揚他的嗓音佳妙，唸白爽脆，允以「拾黃金」劇，學小樓，黃三，孫菊仙，朱素雲等的腔調，維妙維肖，灌在唱片裏簡直能以假亂眞，辨不出是王君所仿傚的。當時我同工程師一商量，誰知他們西人的心理是沒有名氣的一概不要，及至將近歲尾，王君又託榮稚峯君向我懇商，無論如何須得帮帮窮朋友的忙，卽令三百塊錢灌兩片或三片都可以的。後來我同碧眼兒說道：「這一百塊錢由我墊付，倘是灌過後不能賣出去，也由我賠償蠟版的損失。一經此一番商討後，總算把王君的「拾金一灌了三片。豈知出於意料之外的，居然會大賣特賣，這三張本算一者，人家一買就是三張，年結結算就是這幾張片子利益最厚。因爲那是三十三元一張的收晋費，較之梅博士每片一千五百元的代價可相差的遠啦，當時我纔替潦倒的王君吐了這口氣。</p>

<h3>Generalissimo Chiang Orders Hainan Island Garrison Commander Wang Yi to Arouse the People to Resist and Display National Prestige; Japan Withdraws Warships from Various Locations to Concentrate in Tokyo Bay, Plans to Build a Naval Port in Ganglang Bay, Prohibits Other Countries' Ships from Entering</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chiang telegraphed Li Hanhun, relaying orders to Wang Yi, commander of the Hainan Island resistance: Your department is responsible for the defense of Qiongzhou. The defending soldiers have a duty to encourage the troops and arouse the people to resist, thereby displaying national prestige. (Special dispatch, 9 p.m. on the 1st)</p>
<p>Xuwen: Japanese troops invading Hainan Island continue to advance inland, attempting to eliminate the main force of the Chinese army. The isolated Chinese army is making full use of mobile tactics, inflicting heavy blows on the Japanese everywhere. Although Anding and other places were evacuated successively due to unfavorable terrain, the Chinese army is still fighting bravely in the area west of Anding to east of Chengmai [illegible]. (Dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Japanese forces in South China are insufficient for allocation. More than 3,000 troops have been transferred from Shanghai. Japan has withdrawn troops from various locations and a large number of Japanese warships have concentrated in the Tokyo Bay area of ​​Hainan Island. Three and a half divisions are concentrated between Yueyang and Pingjiang. More than 10,000 Japanese troops have been added to the Ruoxi area, plotting to invade Changsha and Nanchang. (Special dispatch, 9 p.m. on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Japanese troops on Hainan Island have been plotting to invade inland recently. France plans to build a large naval port in Ganglang Bay, which has the same significance as the British naval port in Singapore. In addition, the French governor has announced that, except for French warships, all ships are prohibited from entering. Japanese ships often frequented the bay in the past, but now a wide area is prohibited from navigation, which is also a kind of defense against Japan. (Special dispatch, 9 p.m. on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to news from foreigners outside Guangzhou Bay, since the Japanese army successfully landed on Hainan Island, its ambitions for the Leizhou Peninsula have become obvious. However, the Chinese army has completed its defenses and is waiting for the Japanese army to attack, and will give them a head-on blow. At present, Japanese warships are densely concentrated in the Hainan Island area, obviously using Hainan as a base to attempt a landing near Beihai. It is heard that in the past three days, the Japanese army has attempted to land on the southwest coast of the Leizhou Peninsula three times, but all attempts were repelled by the Chinese army. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Lu Hua Fang [a person’s name] news, eight Japanese warships are currently anchored in the sea area of ​​Haifeng and Lufeng. A team of Japanese troops attempted to land at Shanwei, which belongs to Haifeng County, yesterday, but was repelled by the Chinese army. Huilai, 60 miles east of Lufeng, has also been spied on by Japanese warships recently, so the situation in eastern Guangdong is becoming increasingly tense. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: The Japanese troops in Huaxian, Xinjie, and Xinminbu were attacked by the assault troops of a certain Chinese division. The Japanese troops responded fiercely. The Chinese army bravely charged and killed more than 70 Japanese soldiers. On the 26th, the Japanese troops retreated to Daling. (Dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>Shuxian: The Japanese troops in Sanjiang and other places feel extremely threatened. In order to deal with the attacks of Chinese guerrillas, they have also formed Japanese guerrilla units to search everywhere. However, they are unfamiliar with the terrain, so Japanese soldiers have been discovered and annihilated by the Chinese in large numbers in recent days. (Dispatch on the 1st)</p>

<h3>2.4 Million Chinese Troops in Training</h3>
<p>(London) Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Guo Taiqi said in a speech in Liverpool today on the situation in the Far East that he believes the darkest period for China and the world has passed, and that light has been revealed in China and its friendly countries. Guo strongly stated China's determination to fight to the end for freedom and independence, and said that according to the latest news, Generalissimo Chiang has 2.4 million people in training, proposing that one-third of them attack the Japanese defense lines in the occupied areas, one-third engage in positional warfare, and the rest engage in guerrilla warfare.

<p>Pingjiang: On the 27th, a private named Takeshima of the 7th Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Regiment of the 9th Division of the Japanese army was captured in Xishandong, Tongcheng. He was recently escorted here. According to his confession, the Japanese troops in Tongcheng belong to the 9th Division. At present, about one regiment is stationed in the city, and one regiment is stationed in the area between Tongcheng and Chongyang, as well as one artillery regiment. The focus of the Japanese army's attack on Jiangnan seems to be aimed at Nanchang, so the reason for the delay in launching the attack is fourfold: (1) Due to the active Chinese guerrillas, especially the Lushan guerrillas, the Japanese communication is sometimes cut off. (2) Due to transportation difficulties, highways and railways are often damaged by the Chinese army. (3) Due to the low water level of the lake, the navy has no room for activity. (4) Due to the brewing of the so-called peace movement. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese difficulties are increasing day by day and they are struggling to cope. (Dispatch on the 1st)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japan's Dream of Controlling the Concessions</h3>
<p>Recently, because many large and small puppets of the puppet organization have been assassinated in Shanghai one after another, Japanese Consul General Miura has submitted two notes to the Shanghai Municipal Council. Rumor has it that he has made many accusations regarding the security issues of the concessions and requested that the concession authorities "cooperate" with Japan to jointly crack down on the so-called terrorist activities in the concessions. Whether the occurrence of these assassinations is the action of Chinese people eliminating traitors, or the mutual killings of traitors, or even a carefully planned trick by other parties for other purposes, we do not need to speculate arbitrarily before the case is resolved. However, Japan's special attention to the recent assassinations in Shanghai and its true intentions are very worthy of attention from both Chinese and foreign people.</p>
<p>Since the Chinese army withdrew from the suburbs of Shanghai, many assassinations have occurred in Shanghai. Many of these assassinations were based on political reasons. Assassinations based on political reasons cannot be eliminated by military and police forces alone, and this is true in any country. Even in the Japanese-occupied areas of China, where security is heavily guarded, the assassination of the puppet mayor of Hangzhou and the numerous assassination cases in Wuxi, averaging five per day, the Japanese army could not prevent them in advance or solve them afterwards. Shanghai is a complex metropolis, and the puppets who are despised by the people often carry out major activities in the concessions. However, the Shanghai concession authorities, except for the Hongkou area under Japanese military occupation and the areas beyond the boundaries of the concessions in western Shanghai, which are shrouded in the power of the puppet organization, where they cannot exercise their powers, have achieved very satisfactory results in maintaining general security. This is commonly recognized by Chinese and foreign residents in the concessions. As for the recent assassinations of puppet organization personnel, since the locations occurred in the area beyond the boundaries of the concessions under the control of the Japanese army, which is beyond the reach of the police power of the public concession, the concession authorities are of course not responsible for it.</p>
<p>Japan's attention to the recent assassinations in Shanghai is actually not for the assassinations themselves, but to attempt to control the concessions through this. Japan has negotiated with the concession authorities in various places many times in the past, demanding to increase its power in the concessions in various places. The demand to abolish the concessions has almost become a common argument in Japan recently. Japan believes that in order to achieve the goal of monopolizing the Far East and blockading China's gateway to Shanghai, it is necessary to eradicate the last base of European and American power in China, the concessions. Although the current concessions, such as Tianjin, Hankou, and Shanghai, have already become isolated islands in terms of the situation, they still retain a large number of Chinese and foreign people, and the economic activities in these places still have enormous power in the Japanese-occupied areas. In the past, Japan implemented the Japanese yen bloc plan in North China and tried to undermine the Chinese legal currency in various ways. However, due to the proper handling by the Chinese government and the absolute trust of the people in the legal currency, Japan's policy of replacing the legal currency with counterfeit money finally failed. Some Japanese economists believe that the concessions are the base for supporting the legal currency and point out that the concessions have a very strong political color. According to yesterday's Tianjin correspondent of the Shanghai-based North China Daily News, the Japanese authorities in North China are now forcibly implementing punitive regulations for using the legal currency. Because there is no concession in Peiping, the people can only yield. However, counterfeit currency is not popular in the British and French concessions in Tianjin, which is ironclad proof. Therefore, the concessions have become thorns in the eyes of the Japanese.</p>
<p>Moreover, the areas that Japan currently occupies in China are only some transportation routes and larger cities. Within these areas, except for the concessions, they have either become scorched earth or have long become worlds of vice and gambling. Originally, the main industrial and commercial activities in China were mostly concentrated in several major cities with concessions. Since this Sino-Japanese War, all economic activities in the Chinese guerrilla areas have been completely concentrated in these relatively safe concessions. Japan cannot achieve the goal of economic invasion if it cannot obtain control of all economic activities within its occupied areas. Therefore, Japan has recently repeatedly released information saying that it wants to abolish the concessions and consular jurisdiction of various countries in China. This time, Japan's submission to the Shanghai concession authorities for the Shanghai security issue is obviously a reconnaissance effort to attempt to control the Shanghai concession.</p>
<p>The negotiations between the Shanghai concession authorities and the Japanese side are currently underway, and the authorities in London and Tokyo are also closely monitoring their development, which shows that this is not only a change in the authority of the Shanghai Municipal Council itself, but a fundamental issue of the existence of European and American power in China. The British government has recently stated that it will never change the current organization of the Shanghai Municipal Council and hopes that other European and American countries that have relations with the concessions will adopt a consistent attitude with Britain and jointly prevent the development of Japan's aggressive ambitions. It can be considered that they have already had a considerable limit to their concessions to Japan. The Chinese and foreign tax-paying residents in the concessions should also unite to support the reasonable attitude of the Municipal Council to maintain security by itself, so as to avoid the autocratic police power in the special area falling into the hands of autocratic forces.</p>

<h3>U.S. Silver Purchase Bill Amendment Rejected; Dollar's Gold Content Unchanged; Treasury Secretary Explains Financial Stability</h3>

The main purpose of implementing this fund is to stabilize the exchange rate between the US dollar and Chinese currency, so as to fulfill the agreement established with the Chinese government. Morgenthau said that the US silver purchase policy has provided assistance to China because American purchases of silver are of great help to China. (28th Associated Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The House Monetary Committee discussed financial issues today. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau delivered a speech, solemnly declaring that the United States government does not intend to change the current gold content of the US dollar, and said that the Exchange Equalization Fund is flexible in its operation and has made great contributions to adjusting finance and maintaining commerce. He said, "In the past five years, the situation has been uneasy, and the financial market has changed dramatically. The United States government has been able to maintain the current gold content of the US dollar. Unless it is necessary in the future, we will not want to change it." As for the Exchange Equalization Fund, it was established in 1934, with a total of $2,000,000,000, which was obtained from currency devaluation. Of this amount, $1,800,000,000 remains in the treasury and has never been used. At the end of September last year, when the situation in Europe was tense and large amounts of capital flowed into the United States, if there had been no Exchange Equalization Fund to adjust it, the price of the US dollar would have changed drastically, and it might even have jeopardized American commerce. The importance of this fund can be seen from this. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Fisheries Negotiations at a Standstill; Japan Demonstrates to Russia; 20,000 Fishermen Prepared for Free Action; Rumor of Cruisers Concentrated in a Certain Port</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) 150 Japanese fishing boats and 20,000 fishermen have completed all necessary preparations to cope with the crisis after the failure of the Japan-Soviet Union negotiations to conclude a temporary fishing agreement. They are currently waiting in Hakodate in northern Japan, intending to set sail this month. Regardless of the outcome of the negotiations, these fishermen are determined to fish in Soviet territorial waters during the next fishing season in order to maintain the rights they obtained after the Russo-Japanese War. Japanese newspapers mostly stated that Foreign Minister Arita's instruction to the ambassador to the Soviet Union on February 16 was the final warning issued to the Soviet authorities. If the Soviet authorities do not change their attitude, Japan will be forced to take resolute steps to protect its rights. According to Mr. Tanaka, a director of the North Sea Fisheries Company, speaking to reporters, "We cannot temporarily abandon our legitimate rights in the North Sea. Although we are now waiting for government instructions, we have decided that we will not give up an inch of our fishing rights in eastern Siberia. Even if we have to take resolute measures to deal with the situation, we still intend to set sail to fish according to the predetermined time each season." The coast of eastern Siberia is about 6,000 miles long, with 386 fishing areas scattered throughout the area. About 20,000 fishermen from northern Japan engage in fishing there, a situation that has lasted for many years. The annual catch is worth about 50 million Japanese yen, of which about 30 million yen worth of fish is canned and transported to foreign countries, and the rest is sold in Japan. The most valuable fishery along the Okhotsk Sea and the Bering Coast is in the river channels and ports, as these are the breeding grounds for salmon. Most of the above locations have canning factories. At present, well-informed circles are doubtful about whether Japanese fishermen can work normally in these coastal fishing areas in the face of Soviet opposition, because Japanese warships cannot easily protect them. The Japanese naval authorities are still maintaining their usual secrecy about what kind of steps Japan will take to protect its rights if the ongoing Japan-Soviet negotiations in Moscow fail to conclude a treaty. However, it is rumored that a squadron of light cruisers is currently concentrated in a certain port in northern Korea, and other warships are also concentrated in northern Japan in preparation for unforeseen circumstances.

<h3>US Senate Discusses Rearmament Bill; Internationalists and Isolationists Debate Fiercely; Naval Exercises Completed</h3>
<p>(Washington) When the Senate continued to debate the air force and army rearmament bill today, Democratic Senator Clark expressed fierce opposition. He stated that the United States is not in danger now and denounced the madness of those who drafted the bill. Clark also said that troublemakers throughout Europe have been agitating for a second war for twenty years and have used various scams to try to lure us into their shells. Senator Borah also expressed the same sentiment, calling the bill intimidation. According to military experts, the 3,700 new aircraft that the United States proposes to purchase actually exceed the army's ability to use them. The development of today's debate is that 12 isolationist members of parliament have demanded the restoration of the Ludlow Amendment to the Neutrality Act, that is, a national referendum must be held before the country declares war. Progressive Party Senator La Follette expressed strong support for this proposal, saying that this amendment would be the final deterrent to secret diplomacy that would induce us to join foreign wars. The United States suffered from this kind of secret diplomacy before joining the last world war. Democratic Congressman Lee expressed his support for the bill, saying that it was the only language that could be understood by the various dictators. There was also a lengthy debate about the issue of France purchasing American aircraft. Republican Congressman Nye said that the United States should stop selling arms overseas forever. How long will we continue to supply the world with arms, or even those who will use them to attack us, for the sake of a tiny profit? The Japanese aircraft that bombed the American gunboat Panay used American gasoline and bombs made of American steel. Senator Borah then joined the debate, saying that the United States had been selling military materials to Germany for years and only stopped this transaction after Germany began to demand colonies. This situation is a peculiar form of neutrality. Democratic Congressman Barkley and Democratic Congressman Lee both defended this matter, believing that it was perfectly justified for the United States to sell aircraft to France. Lee said that every aircraft sold to democratic countries is equal to one less that the United States needs. If they have the same strength as Germany, there may not be a Munich Agreement and the destruction of Czechoslovakia. (28th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Britain Recognizes New Government of Spain; Labour Party Impeachment Motion Rejected; Opposition Condemns as Suicide Policy; Eden Says Situation Still Worrying</h3>
<p>(London) After Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons yesterday the recognition of the National Army government of Spain, the opposition Labour Party immediately filed a vote of no confidence. The House of Commons submitted it for discussion today. Major Attlee, the Labour Party leader, first delivered a speech, criticizing the government's current policy fiercely. Prime Minister Chamberlain personally replied, and former Foreign Secretary Eden also delivered a speech in support. The House of Commons then submitted the vote of no confidence for a vote and rejected it by a vote of 344 to 137. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Major Attlee, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, delivered a speech on the recognition of the National Army government of Spain, fiercely criticizing Prime Minister Chamberlain and accusing him of not shirking responsibility to other governments. He said, "Prime Minister Chamberlain's intention is probably to have French Prime Minister Daladier first state his position. Prime Minister Daladier actually rebuffed him, saying that this matter was caused by the advice of the British government and was subject to its pressure. Prime Minister Chamberlain's plan was not successful. At the very least, the Prime Minister should have obtained compensation for the British soldiers and British ships that were bombed by National Army aircraft. Has this been done? Prime Minister Chamberlain will probably recognize any government that violates international law and violates human nature. Is that really the case? The Spanish Republican government is a brave defender of democracy. Prime Minister Chamberlain stabbed it in the back. The spirit of our country, passed down through generations, will the government be willing to uphold it unswervingly? The various autonomous territories and democratic countries of the world cannot help but doubt it. The world says that Prime Minister Chamberlain always wants to befriend those who advocate violence and dictatorship. This kind of feeling will have a serious impact all over the world. The British people have suffered a blow in spirit, so the implementation of the national voluntary service system will inevitably be difficult. The British people are willing to join hands with France, but only if this France maintains the two great traditions of freedom and democracy and never becomes reactionary." (28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Liberal Party leader Sinclair then spoke, saying that the British government is now submitting a policy of "bankruptcy and suicide" to Parliament. The British government is now preparing to recognize a government that "cannot maintain its authority without foreign troops." The British government has strengthened the power of the various dictatorial countries and weakened the strength of the democratic countries. Countries that used to trust democratic countries have now been successively cheated and all exclaim "to have been humiliated in vain". Former Foreign Secretary Eden then spoke, saying that, regardless of the decision of the House of Commons, the Spanish issue will still be one of our worrying events. Britain cannot stand by and watch any situation in which Spain or any part of its territory, islands, or overseas possessions is under the rule of any non-Spanish power or is subject to part of their jurisdiction. He believes that insisting on non-recognition will encourage the continuation of the Spanish civil war. This is a terrible responsibility that he dares not take on himself. Therefore, he supports the government. (28th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain's Defense; Recognition Should Not Be Subject to Conditions; But Franco Has Guaranteed No Reprisals and Has Declared That He Will Uphold National Independence</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Chamberlain rose to answer, saying, "Major Attlee's fierce criticism of me is surprising. To deceive the House of Commons, or to avoid it by trying to make things difficult for the government because of the issue submitted for discussion, is not what I do best. Anyone who knows me well should recognize that." "Regarding the recognition of the Spanish National Army government, we are willing to maintain harmonious relations with the French government and will officially announce recognition only after France agrees. The matter of recognition was not confirmed until February 24th. If our country delays recognizing the National Army government, it will not help the Republican government or the people of Madrid, but will hinder the mutual relations between Britain and the National Army government. Britain has no power over the National Army government. It is difficult to believe that Mr. Attlee says that various democratic countries doubt the British government, because France and Britain are actually following each other step by step. After the Spanish National Army captured Barcelona and occupied the Autonomous Region of Catalonia, what the British government should determine is whether the National Army has gained an advantage and whether the Republican government can still be considered a legitimate government. The answer is very clear. No one knows whether the Republican government's organization is intact or where it is located, so it is difficult to continue to recognize it. Do the various opposition parties think that if Britain refuses to recognize the National Army government, the Republican government will continue to resist? If so, then it goes against the various rules of humanity. Recognition should not be subject to any conditions, but it is a different matter if you are preparing to resort to war. General Franco has repeatedly provided assurances to the British government that he will not commit killings indiscriminately. If we were to ask General Franco to agree to issue a general amnesty so that even those who have committed heinous crimes can be pardoned, would that be reasonable? General Franco telegraphed the British government on February 23rd, stating that Spain will never allow foreign intervention to harm the country's dignity and integrity of sovereignty, nor will it use retaliatory means against the opposition because of differences in political views. However, the National Army has now won, and the defeated must surrender unconditionally. All of this is enough to comfort people. General Franco is patriotic and magnanimous, which has been repeatedly proven in the liberated areas. The safety of Spaniards who have not committed criminal offenses can be guaranteed. In short, the Spanish National Army government has been recognized by nineteen countries. The urgent task is to end the civil war. The British government is willing to do its best to achieve this." At this point, former Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech, publicly supporting it, but also said, "The Spanish civil war has caused unease in all aspects for two and a half years. What we should know is that, regardless of the decision of the House of Commons, this uneasiness will still be difficult to eliminate for some time. Our country maintains friendship with Spain, not for monetary gain, but because both countries share common interests. It is hoped that this will not be misunderstood." (28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>German Air Force Anniversary: Göring Takes Credit, Urges Redoubled Efforts</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Today marks the anniversary of the restoration of the German Air Force. Following is a summarized translation of General Göring's radio address: "On March 1, 1935, Führer Hitler ordered me to restore the Air Force. Since then, the Air Force has stood as an equal alongside the Army and Navy. Since receiving this order, I have worked with my colleagues to rapidly develop the Air Force's facilities, never daring to slacken. The efforts of the Air Force personnel were closely related to the annexation of the Sudetenland last September. Last year, rumors spread, and tensions rose. If it weren't for our strong national defense and superior Air Force, the outcome would have been unpredictable. I am delighted that the Air Force can now be a powerful tool for Germany. In future dealings with various republican elements, the important position occupied by the Air Force will remain no different from today. Therefore, we must not be complacent with our existing achievements. If we do not strive for continuous progress, it is no different from rowing against the current. The Air Force's progress is constantly evolving. Considering the disturbances in various parts of the world and the tense international situation, how can we delay the development of the Air Force? Recalling when Germany had not yet expanded its military, Hitler proposed a practical arms limitation conference, but the great powers refused to accept it and now blame others, claiming that Germany should be responsible for the huge expenses of military expansion. Are they not oblivious to their own responsibilities?" Göring then elaborated on his plan to develop the great strength of the German Air Force, stating that development is not limited to raw materials and equipment, as the strength of German aircraft factories is extremely strong, and the excellence of their products has won international praise. The new records created by German aviators and the outstanding performances of German aircraft have long been widely acclaimed and need no further elaboration. Now, we should pay special attention to training excellent talent and never allow those who are not truly willing to learn to fill the ranks. Furthermore, the selection of Air Force officers will not be influenced by class or social status. Any German has the possibility of serving as an officer, without discrimination. The only distinctions are character, courage, technical skill, and performance. As for rewards, personal honor and service to the motherland should be foremost in the minds of Air Force soldiers."

<p>(Berlin) Today is "Aviation Day." General Göring, Minister of Aviation and Dictator of the Four-Year Economic Plan, recently delivered a radio address, recounting the achievements of the National Socialist government in building aviation. He stated that four years ago, when the entire nation suffered from unemployment and was in a state of enslavement, the first batch of aircraft built by the government was already soaring in the national airspace and was deeply welcomed by the entire people. It is important to know that peace enjoyed by those who are strong and powerful is not easily taken away by the world. We are not satisfied with the achievements we have made in the past, because complacency is regression. Moreover, the world situation is extremely chaotic and could trigger a crisis at any time. The Jewish agitators, who are also profit-seeking agitators, incite war and confuse people. (One-day Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Palestine Problem: Impasse Remains Unbroken, Jewish Representatives Insist on Original Stance, British Side Expresses Willingness to Revise Original Proposal</h3>
<p>(London) The British government and Jewish representatives held an informal meeting this afternoon to discuss the Jewish refusal to accept the British proposal. This discussion has now been adjourned for two reasons: first, the British government needs to consider the general situation, and second, British Foreign Secretary Halifax recently contracted the flu and is bedridden. There are no current plans to continue the meeting with the Arabs, but today's meeting will still be held as originally planned. According to sources, the McMahon correspondence is expected to be released around the end of this week. Although there are still one or two points unfinished regarding the translation, it is generally complete. According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, the outcome of this afternoon's informal consultations is that the situation between the British and Jewish delegations remains unchanged. The two informal consultations held over the past two days have failed to break the deadlock caused by the Jewish decision not to accept the British proposal as a basis for continued negotiations. It is said that the reason for the indefinite postponement of the aforementioned informal consultations is to give the British delegation time to consider whether the proposed recommendations should be revised and, if so, where to start. It is widely believed that the British delegation has indicated its willingness to concede on various points that the Jewish side deems not significant. According to a prominent Jewish representative, the postponement of the consultations does not mean that the meeting has failed, but the responsibility for resuming it lies with the British government. The entire Arab delegation met at the Egyptian Embassy tonight. According to sources, the main purpose of this meeting was to discuss the British government's proposal to resolve the Palestine issue this week. According to opinions from various Arab circles, the current British proposal lacks clarity, making it difficult for Arabs to decide whether to accept or reject it. However, the general mood is optimistic, believing that the British proposal can serve as a hopeful basis for future discussions, and that the British side may at any time clarify and expand it into a more practical plan.

<h3>British Army Budget Totals Over £161.1 Million, an Increase of Over £46.7 Million Compared to Previous Year</h3>
<p>(London) The new army budget for 1939 was released today, totaling £161,133,000, an increase of £46,714,000 compared to 1938. At the same time, the army's strength will increase by 15,700 personnel, totaling 185,700. Both of these totals far exceed the figures for recent years. Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha stated in the memorandum attached to the budget that, including normal supplementary funding, the figure for 1939 is £148,155,000, and the figure for 1938 is £106,500,000, an increase of £41,655,000. This supplementary funding comes from various sources other than taxation. The total amount of the current army budget is £79,000,000, which includes defense contributions from India, Burma, and various colonies, but most of it is allocated from the reorganization fund of the 1937 National Defense Loan Act, totaling £66,000,000. However, the figure stipulated in the 1939 budget to be issued from the reorganization fund is £66,232,000, while in 1938 it was £21,143,000. Therefore, the net amount borne by taxpayers is £81,923,000, a decrease of £3,434,000 compared to 1938. The conscription situation for the entire year is satisfactory. If the current rate can be maintained, the shortfall will be greatly reduced. During the fiscal year ending at the end of March 1939, the number of new recruits will be 40,000, while the final approved number for the fiscal year ending at the end of March of last year was 29,482. As for the detailed statistics of arms production, they cannot be made public for the benefit of the public. The acceleration of the rearmament program can be seen in the comparison of ordnance expenditures passed in the past four years: £9,073,500 in 1936, £25,032,000 in 1937, £38,383,000 in 1938, and £55,509,000 in 1939. Hore-Belisha further stated that this year is one of the most productive years in the history of the local army. (Second Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Hitler and Mussolini to Meet Again in Northern Italy; Ciano's Attempt to Win Over Poland Fails; Berlin-Rome Axis to be Revised</h3>
<p>(London) British newspapers in Berlin anticipate that German Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will meet in northern Italy to revise the Axis policy because there have been various changes in Europe recently. Germany is quite disappointed with the results of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Poland, believing that the results obtained from this trip were extremely minor and not at all what was expected beforehand. German political circles seem to think that the anti-German demonstrations in Poland are a minor matter, but they believe that Ciano's failure to obtain a guarantee from Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck that Poland would remain neutral if war broke out involving France is of great importance. This situation, in terms of its impact on Italy's Mediterranean policy, is the reason for the two leaders to discuss general policy. (One-day Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Counterfeit Currency Has No Credibility; Trade Declines in Pingjin and Qingdao; Situation in Dalian is Particularly Tragic; Japanese Troops in Tianjin Are Trapped by Guerrillas</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports: A well-known American businessman who traveled to Beiping, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and other ports in northern China returned to Shanghai. Yesterday (February 28th), he stated that due to exchange restrictions, trade in North China has been reduced to a barter basis, even this kind of trade is very minimal. The Japanese authorities strictly enforce new regulations allowing imports, which must be handled through Yokohama Specie Bank, and force Chinese people to use counterfeit currency, causing export trade to fall into a standstill. If import trade is prohibited for a long time, export trade will suffer the same loss. Importers and exporters in Tianjin and Yantai are trying to barter, that is, to issue export credit loans in exchange for import drafts. Of course, this method cannot completely offset the loss of exchange, but it can reduce the loss to a minimum. North China merchants believe that the Japanese authorities will not allow them to continue this barter system for a long time. Tianjin's exports are dominated by farmers' agricultural products, but since the Japanese army occupied the area, agricultural activity has been drastically reduced. According to those who have lived in North China for many years, farmers have indeed abandoned their fields in recent months and moved to the interior or cities. There are many abandoned fields in the countryside of North China. According to observations of the state of the fields, farmers are obviously not prepared for spring plowing. This is due to two influences. One is that the Japanese army destroys villages and seizes agricultural products for military purposes or in retaliation for the activity of guerrillas, so farmers no longer care about the land. The second, also quite important, is that a large number of farmers obey the scorched earth policy, leave their homes, and leave abandoned fields as a reward to the invaders. The Japanese authorities have banned the export of many goods that could be used for military purposes, almost completely halting commerce. As far as Chinese merchants are concerned, the implementation of commercial restrictions has instead made them focus on land, because most Chinese merchants feel uneasy about holding cash and want to quickly turn cash into property. They have no trust in the "Federal Reserve Bank" and its counterfeit currency, and although they occasionally use it, it is only under certain circumstances that they are forced to do so. Most of the Chinese merchants I have contacted are willing to exchange counterfeit currency for national currency at a 60% discount. I believe they are willing to exchange counterfeit currency for foreign currency at a 40% discount. Regarding this point, I can speak from my own experience. No matter what ratio the Japanese authorities set for exchanging counterfeit currency for foreign currency, it will never be fulfilled. I have tried to exchange counterfeit currency for foreign currency, but even the "Federal Reserve Bank" itself is unwilling to accept its counterfeit currency. After considering all these factors, it is easy to be optimistic about the future of foreign trade in North China. When the reporter asked whether he had seen signs of guerrilla activity during his trip to North China, the American businessman replied, "When I was staying in Tianjin, the Japanese officers were very panicked and uneasy. Two weeks ago, the Japanese army sent out 25 patrolmen to investigate the location of guerrillas, but they never returned. Two days later, they sent 50 more, who also did not return. Therefore, the Japanese army did not dare to leave Tianjin a step. The towns and villages near Tianjin and Yantai are guarded by Japanese troops during the day, but in the evening, they all return to the garrison headquarters and dare not go out until dawn. Along the Pingjin Railway, I saw a bridge that was being repaired. Others told me that this bridge was destroyed by guerrillas a week ago. Although I did not personally witness combat during my stay in the north, I was shaken by the sound of heavy artillery one night while staying at a hotel in Beiping, which did not stop all night. The next day, the Japanese authorities claimed that the sound of artillery was target practice, but according to foreigners in Beiping, there was fierce fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops nearby. As for Dalian, which used to be a prosperous city, it is now completely declining. Seeing it is most disappointing. I was quite surprised by the state of Dalian, because before I left the United States for China, I still saw a book sent by the Manchurian "authorities," which contained photos of Dalian's prosperity."</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports from Tianjin: "The currency situation here has not changed, while the situation in Pingjin is very different. Because Beiping has no concessions, the Japanese can forcibly impose punitive regulations on the use of legal currency. Therefore, the paper money of the Federal Reserve has seen a premium. In Tianjin, this counterfeit currency must be discounted before it can be used, and the amount of the discount is approximately equal to the amount of the premium in Beiping. In November and December of last year, there was a great shortage of ten-yuan and five-yuan banknotes in Tianjin. This difficulty no longer exists. Counterfeit Federal Reserve currency is rarely seen in the concessions. The Japanese authorities previously complained about the fact that British and American banks did not recognize counterfeit Federal Reserve currency as legal tender. What is strange is that the German and Italian banks in Tianjin, which are very friendly with Japan in the Anti-Comintern Pact, also refuse to use counterfeit Federal Reserve currency in the same way as British and American banks. The lack of credibility of this counterfeit currency can be seen from this."</p>
<h3>After the Fall of Hainan Island, Japanese Troops Have Not Been Able to Penetrate Deeply</h3>
<p>Post Office Resumes Operations; Foreigners Are Safe</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports: Yesterday (February 28th) afternoon, intermittent but completely reliable news was received from foreign sources stating that the Japanese army first occupied Haikou and Qiongzhou on Hainan Island, and then carried out the usual rape and plunder. However, the situation on the island is now much calmer. In the short period after the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island, the island was in great chaos, but the situation now seems to have stabilized greatly. Although the residents of Haikou and Qiongzhou can return to the city, their furniture and other items have been looted. The Chinese army does not seem to have put up much resistance in these two places. Now, puppet governments have been established in the two cities and on the island. Since the Japanese army invaded, traffic on Hainan Island has been cut off. At present, postal and public transportation services have resumed in the areas occupied by the Japanese army. Japanese inspectors have been assigned to each post office. Foreigners on the island have not been mistreated so far. The Japanese army has not penetrated deep into the interior. The central part of the island is full of high mountains and dense forests. These areas cannot be invaded. Currently, there are twenty-three foreign missionaries on Hainan Island, all belonging to the American Presbyterian Church, including five in Qiongzhou, six in Haikou, and the rest in Nanduo and other places.</p>
<h3>Air Traffic Between China and Burma Increased; New Aircraft Purchased</h3>
<p>Hong Kong dispatch: According to the Hong Kong office of the China National Aviation Corporation, the Chongqing-Rangoon route between China and Burma, which uses Douglas aircraft flown by Captain Schappi, departed from Chongqing on the 28th. There will be two flights per week, connecting with Imperial Airways flights. Imperial Airways aircraft test flew on February 1st. The route between China and Burma follows the Yunnan-Burma Road. Imperial Airways has built radio stations, temporary airfields, and other facilities, which have also been completed. China National Aviation Corporation has ordered two new aircraft from the United States, worth US$250,000, which are expected to arrive in Hong Kong at the end of this summer. These new aircraft can carry 24 passengers and have a maximum speed of 230 miles per hour.</p>
<h3>Zhoushan Islands Repeatedly Bombed by Japanese Warships</h3>
<p>Destroyed Temples and Civilian Houses</p>
<p>Ningbo Correspondence: The Zhoushan Islands, isolated in a corner, are located on the frontline of national defense. The nearby waters are rich in fish, making it our country's largest fishing ground. Daishan Island in the archipelago produces a significant amount of salt, making it the second largest salt field in Zhejiang Province. The Sijiao Islands of the adjacent Shengsi Islands, under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu, are particularly rich in yellow sand. After August 13th, the Japanese army, for military convenience, forcibly occupied islands such as Shengshan and Sijiao to build airfields and wounded soldier hospitals, abandoning them after several months. The Zhoushan Islands are renowned nationwide for their fish production, which the Japanese have long coveted. In September of last year, Japanese warships sent letters to the Dinghai County Government and the Shenjiamen Town Office, requesting "permission to send personnel to conduct fishery surveys." Meanwhile, they also bombarded and harassed islands such as Qushan, Changtu, Daishan, and Putuo.</p>
<p>Shelling and Harassment: The Japanese, to seize fishing rights, colluded with puppets to establish a fake fish market in Yangshupu, Shanghai, attempting to exploit fishermen. However, the fishermen of the Zhoushan Islands, understanding the greater good, firmly refused to cooperate. The Japanese army then vented its anger on fishermen at sea. At noon on February 5th, three Japanese warships suddenly sailed into Dinghai Harbor, anchoring 400 meters from the shore. Subsequently, they launched speedboats to reconnoiter. The local defense forces, to protect national territory, fired a volley of shots, causing the Japanese boats to scurry back to their warships. Unable to land, the Japanese soldiers became enraged and fired nine shots, bombarding the area around Dongyue Temple (about a li from the city).</p>
<p>Multiple Temples Destroyed: Multiple halls were destroyed, and the temple keeper, Weng Asi, was killed. That evening, the warship fired eleven more shots towards the shore, with shells landing near the Xiangchun Restaurant by the Weitou Wharf. The next morning, it fired ten more shots before sailing away. At that time, the local residents, upon hearing the initial shelling, evacuated to the surrounding countryside. The city residents fled, only gradually returning home after the Japanese warship had departed. On the afternoon of the 16th, another Japanese warship, No. 4, sailed into Datou Harbor, anchoring and arbitrarily seizing civilian boats. After mooring overnight, at around 11:00 AM the next morning, it fired eleven more shells towards the shore, partially destroying the Taisui Hall of Dongyue Temple and a small section of the wall base. One shell also landed at the Le Laibin residence below the temple, destroying a veranda. Multiple shells also landed in places such as Yangjiatang and Hujiaqiao.</p>
<p>Many Shells Also Landed: A small number of civilian houses were destroyed, and one resident, Wang Xiaoman, was injured. When the Japanese warship shelled the shore, the Dinghai County Self-Defense Association and others disregarded the danger and ventured through the gunfire to carry out communication work. Although the residents of Dinghai were only three or four li away from the Japanese warship, they remained calm and composed, which was admirable. The Japanese army repeatedly attempted to land near Dinghai County, but two shellings proved ineffective. On the morning of the 21st, three warships of the Japanese 4th Destroyer Squadron sailed into the harbor opposite Gaoting Town on Daishan Island, north of the county seat, and continuously shelled the shore, firing a total of more than fifty shells. The shells landed in the Xinkaitou area, destroying parts of the Gaoxian Temple and Tianhou Palace, and damaging more than twenty civilian houses. The wife of Zhu Dufa was injured by shrapnel. Two more shells landed in the Lao Kaitou Xintongxing Native Produce Store, destroying several houses and injuring two shop assistants. Around 2:00 PM, the three warships set fire to six Shanghai-bound transport ships, including the Ruihong, which were docked in the harbor, before setting sail for Dongshajiao Town (a densely populated town with thriving commerce, being a major market town under Dinghai County). They shelled the shore facing the sea, attempting to land, but ultimately failed due to the strong defenses.</p>
<p>Ultimately Unsuccessful: In total, the Japanese warships fired more than twenty shells. Seven shells landed in Yangfu Temple on Tiebansha, heavily damaging the main hall and the front gate. More than thirty civilian houses were destroyed in the vicinity. Fortunately, the residents had already evacuated, and only one resident, Wu Awu, was hit in the head. Afterwards, at 4:30 PM, the Japanese warships set sail for Qushan. Currently, order on the Zhoushan Islands has gradually returned, and the situation is very peaceful. It is speculated that the Japanese warships' shelling was intended to harass the rear.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops from Xiashi Attacked Dingqiao, Repelled</h3>
<p>Haining Correspondence: Since the Chinese army recaptured Xieqiao and Fengshu Temple in Haining, the Japanese troops around Xiashi have been heavily guarded. Three hundred reinforcements newly arrived from Hangzhou, mostly conscripted men from Taiwan. The other day (27th), they planned to take advantage of the Chinese army's unpreparedness and launched a surprise attack on Dingqiao, a base of the Chinese army. However, the Chinese army had detected this plan early and ambushed the area around the villages. When the Japanese army's advance guard of over a hundred men approached Dingqiao, they were surrounded and attacked. After a fierce battle lasting about an hour, they collapsed and fled. Another seventy or eighty men in the rear were also intercepted by the Chinese army, suffering many casualties. A steamboat was also seized by the Chinese army. The Xiachang Highway, newly built by the Japanese army using forced labor, was completely destroyed by the Chinese army's special operations team. The Japanese troops trapped in Xiashi are in extreme panic.</p>
<h3>Five Thousand Japanese Troops Besiege Haiyan: City Residents Evacuate</h3>
<p>Haiyan Correspondence: Haiyan is an important town in western Zhejiang, so the Japanese army once invaded, but ultimately failed. It is now learned that on the 24th of last month, the county was again attacked by the Japanese army from four directions. One route was from Hangzhou along the highway, with about seven or eight hundred men. Another route was from Jiaxing along the waterway, with more than a thousand Japanese and puppet troops. One route was from the direction of Xiashi, and another was from Pinghu, arriving at Xincang. The total number was about five thousand or more. It is reported that the Chinese army had obtained intelligence in advance, so the Japanese army was intercepted before reaching the hinterland, and a fierce battle ensued. It is currently learned that the Chinese and Japanese sides are still in a stalemate in their original positions, and it is also reported that the Japanese army invading from the Pinghu direction has had its rear route ambushed by the Chinese army near Xincang. As for the residents of the city, the county magistrate has ordered them to evacuate immediately to avoid innocent casualties.</p>

<h3>Terrorist Negotiations Reach Understanding: Concession Situation Relaxes</h3>
<p>Japanese Commander Sakurai Visits Police Commissioner for Secret Talks</p>
<p>Cooperation Between Municipal Council and Japanese Police Becomes Concrete</p>
<p>Negotiations regarding terrorist incidents in the concession have made progress. The Japanese side submitted a new note the other day, indicating acceptance of the Municipal Council's suggestion to cooperate with the Japanese police to prevent the recurrence of terrorist incidents. Therefore, the tense situation of recent days has begun to relax and ease. Japanese Garrison Commander Sakurai visited the Municipal Council Police Commissioner yesterday morning to discuss joint prevention methods and measures in detail. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Commander Visits Police Department</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Japanese Army Garrison Commander Sakurai, leading Colonel Hirota, a military attache, and dozens of armed military police, arrived at the Central Police Station on Fuzhou Road in several vehicles to visit senior officials of the Police Department. They discussed the Municipal Council's proposal to cooperate with the Japanese police to prevent terrorist incidents. Key personnel from the Police Department participated in the talks. Due to the serious nature of the matter, the meeting lasted for three hours. Sakurai and others did not leave until after 1:00 PM. The content of the talks is currently unknown due to strict confidentiality, but it is believed that the Municipal Council has reached a concrete stage of communication with the Japanese police. During the talks, the police station also dispatched many Chinese and Western detectives, along with the accompanying Japanese military police, to be stationed outside the door to maintain security and provide protection. Therefore, the situation in the Fuzhou Road area was very tense yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Terrorist Negotiations Come to a Temporary Halt</p>
<p>According to sources, after the Municipal Council received the new note from the Japanese side, it believed that the terrorist negotiations in the concession could be temporarily brought to a halt. The Japanese side now indicates that it does not want to escalate the situation and is leaning towards the Municipal Council's proposal, agreeing to cooperate with the Japanese police to continue to prevent terrorist incidents. Therefore, the only thing to consider from now on is how to implement this, and to discuss various cooperation details with the Japanese side. It is reported that the Municipal Council has already extracted the key points of the Japanese note and sent them to the directors for review. Once the principles are decided, they will hold talks with the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Western Newspaper Reports Nanjing's Attitude</p>
<p>The North China Daily News yesterday published a telephone message from its Tokyo correspondent, stating that the Foreign Ministry spokesman told him today (28th) (the correspondent claimed), "Japan is willing to sincerely cooperate with the Shanghai Municipal Council. We will wait and see how the plan proposed by the Municipal Council is implemented. We sincerely want to negotiate a harmonious resolution to this dispute. We are willing to reach this resolution with the authorities concerned on the spot." The correspondent said he had sought information from various sources, initially believing that the Japanese authorities had a surprisingly broad view of the situation and that the demands put forward by the Japanese side would be very strict. However, the current moderate approach was unexpected. Therefore, the public widely believes that Japan does not want to urgently create any serious disputes or make the task of the Municipal Council authorities more difficult. The attitude of the general authorities is to accept the plan proposed by the Municipal Council to curb terrorism at face value and see how it progresses. The current trend is that they are at least satisfied with Fessenden's reply, but the authorities are still waiting for developments to see if new disputes will arise. If they do arise, they will decide on subsequent actions. As far as the correspondent knows, the Japanese demands do not include suggestions to obtain control of the concession, as reported elsewhere. According to the reports, Japan is likely to enforce its demands on the police power of the concession.</p>
<p>U.S. Marines Conduct Exercises</p>
<p>The China Press reports that U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment soldiers stationed in Shanghai conducted exercises in the Bubbling Well Road area this morning (1st). It is reported that this is not directly related to the current situation in Shanghai. According to Marine Corps personnel, these exercises are purely routine. However, local observers say that these exercises may have a psychological impact on terrorist groups currently active in the Shanghai area. The patrol teams that the Japanese army had added to Hongkou and the Eastern District since the Lunar New Year were withdrawn yesterday (28th). The Japanese side did not explain this move.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Acknowledges Second Time: Attacked by Guerrilla Forces</h3>
<p>Within the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Triangle Area</p>
<p>Ninety-Five Battles in One Month</p>
<p>Neutral Source Says Japanese Casualties Were Heavy</p>
<p>The China Press reports that a Japanese military spokesman yesterday (28th) revealed for the second time in a week the secret of the startling extent of guerrilla activity within the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou triangle area. He acknowledged that Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai and Hangzhou had engaged in ninety-five battles with Chinese guerrilla forces in the one-month period from January 21st to February 20th. All of these battles were fought in the suburbs of Shanghai, Jiaxing, Songjiang, and Hangzhou. The spokesman did not announce the number of engagements near Taihu Lake and along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. According to the spokesman's acknowledgment on February 23rd, Japanese troops stationed within twenty-five miles of Shanghai had engaged in two hundred and eighty-one battles from August 28th of last year to February 15th of this year. He claimed that seven hundred and thirty-five guerrillas were killed in the Shanghai-Hangzhou area, while the Japanese army suffered four deaths and twelve injuries. A neutral military observer claimed last night that the Japanese side's estimate of losses did not seem accurate. Because the guerrillas often attack first, Japanese casualties were particularly heavy. Recent reports from eyewitnesses indicate that they have seen Japanese wounded arriving at hospitals behind the lines in Shanghai, which seems to confirm the observer's view.</p>
<h3>Four Bombings in Nanjing Road and Jing'an Temple Road Last Night</h3>
<p>Fortunately Only One Rickshaw Puller Injured</p>
<p>The Four Cases Clearly Involved Planned Actions</p>
<p>Between 9:45 PM and 10:50 PM last night, four bombings occurred in quick succession within one hour in the central section of Nanjing Road in the Public Concession and along the Bubbling Well Road near the racecourse. The atmosphere was quite tense at the time. Fortunately, except for an injured rickshaw puller, no major tragedy occurred. However, due to the similarity of the explosives in the two locations, it is feared that the four cases are related. The police are currently conducting a thorough investigation. The details are described as follows:</p>
<p>Sincere Company</p>
<p>The main entrance of the Sincere Amusement Park, located on Nanjing Road and facing Yinghua Street, experienced a sudden explosion at around 9:45 PM last night, when traffic was busy and visitors were about to return home. The explosion occurred on the sidewalk along Nanjing Road in front of the amusement park's main entrance, shocking the surrounding area. The general public fled in panic, as if a major disaster had occurred, and order was temporarily disrupted. The nearby Lao Zha Police Station received the report and immediately ordered a large number of Chinese, Western, and Japanese detectives to rush to the scene to investigate. Except for vehicles, all pedestrians were temporarily prohibited from passing. It is learned that after searching, the detectives recovered fragments of Three Gun cigarettes can on the roadside, and there were still remnants of explosives. The recovered items were taken back to the police station for filing. As for the source of the can, it is claimed that it was thrown from above. Therefore, the police entered the building to search, but there were no results. Fortunately, there were no injuries.</p>
<p>Yinghua Street</p>
<p>While the investigation of the case at the Sincere Amusement Park entrance was still underway, another bombing occurred on Yinghua Street. It was around 10:10 PM, but the explosive was no longer a tin can, but a small bomb. Therefore, its explosive power was greater, and the sound was louder. The bomb seemed to have been thrown from the direction of the Tianyun Building, landing in front of No. 11 Yinghua Street, Modern Photo Studio, with a loud bang, like thunder. Fortunately, there were few pedestrians at the time, so a tragedy was avoided. However, a rickshaw puller from Jiangbei, Chen Youkun, who was soliciting business there, was injured by flying shrapnel and fell to the ground in pain, screaming incessantly. Detectives nearby received the report and rushed to the scene to investigate, and sent the injured rickshaw puller to the hospital for treatment. It was learned afterwards that the detectives recovered several pieces of shrapnel at the scene and sent them to the police station for safekeeping. As for the search results, there were no clues.</p>
<p>Cinderella Ballroom</p>
<p>After the two cases mentioned above occurred in succession, Nanjing Road was immediately filled with detectives, and the situation was very tense. While the detectives were about to report back to the police station and begin to study the case, they suddenly received another alarm, claiming that at around 10:50 PM, another bombing occurred on the sidewalk outside the Cinderella Ballroom at No. 444 Bubbling Well Road, near the Chu Bawang advertising billboard. The Chengdu Road police also dispatched a large number of detectives. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the explosive was a tin can, similar to the one in the Sincere Amusement Park case. Fortunately, the area was quieter, so no one was injured. All the fragments were also taken back to the police station by the detectives for a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Daxin Company</p>
<p>While Nanjing Road was in turmoil, another bombing occurred at the entrance of the Daxin Company at the intersection of Rue Chapsal and Nanjing Road at 9:45 PM. It was impossible to explore where the bomb fell from, but the explosive power was very strong, causing the windows of a black-plated taxi in the concession, registration number 7917, parked there at the time, to be shattered by shrapnel. Fortunately, there was no one in the car, so there were no injuries. In addition, it is rumored that leaflets were also found at the time, but they had already been picked up by the time reporters arrived. According to bystanders, the leaflets contained warnings to those who indulged in nightlife, signed by the "Passionate Blooded Spirit Anti-Traitor Corps". All the shrapnel has been taken back to the police station for filing.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Japanese Troops Gather in Northern Jiangsu: Contact Already Made Along the Coast in Haimen</h3>
<p>Japanese Warships Move to Lower Reaches, Tense Situation</p>
<p>Chinese Army Determined to Recover Lost Territory</p>
<p>In recent days, after the Chinese army's strength increased in the counties along the Yangtze River in northern Jiangsu, it has formed an encirclement around the Japanese army's defense areas. The Japanese side has also increased troops in Haimen and Tongzhou, and several Japanese warships have moved to the lower reaches to be stationed. The situation is rapidly deteriorating with both sides on the verge of conflict. It is learned that contact has already been made in Qinglong Port, Haimen, and the war may expand. The Chinese army is determined to sacrifice to recover lost territory. The details are reported by the Xiandai News Agency reporter as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Move to Lower Reaches</p>
<p>Since the elite troops of the 24th Army Group of the Chinese army arrived in Tongzhou, Rugao, Haimen, Qidong, Chongming, and other counties last week and joined forces with the original stationed troops, their strength has greatly increased, and their military appearance has been invigorated. Therefore, the Japanese troops stationed along the Yangtze River are uneasy and have specially transferred Japanese and puppet troops stationed in Shanghai to Nantong Tiansheng Port, Haimen Qinglong Port, Dasheng No. 3 Factory, and other places to increase defenses. The Japanese warships originally stationed in the upper reaches have also been transferred to the lower reaches to concentrate and await orders. The situation is very urgent. According to people from Tongzhou, there are eight or nine Japanese small gunboats and transport ships, as well as many wooden-hulled motorboats, stationed outside Nantong Tiansheng Port, Rugao Xin Port, Qidong Sanhe Port, Haimen Qinglong Port, and other ports, all traveling back and forth along the Yangtze River. Three or four Japanese planes are patrolling the Yangtze River every day.</p>
<p>Rumors of Contact at Haimen Qinglong Port</p>
<p>After the Chinese and Japanese troops gathered at the ports along the Yangtze River, the situation became tense. The Japanese side is forcibly recruiting civilians to build defensive fortifications. The Chinese army is also digging trenches in the ×× highlands in Haimen and Qidong. It is reported that a skirmish occurred at Haimen Qinglong Port (between Niuhong Port and Xin Port) at 8:00 AM yesterday. By 11:00 AM, the gunfire had subsided. It is unclear whether there were casualties on both sides. According to a reporter who inquired about the Shanghai-bound cargo ship from Beisha last night, he heard intensive gunfire on the shore when passing through the port, and Japanese motorboats were traveling back and forth frequently.</p>
<p>Determined to Resist and Recover Lost Territory</p>
<p>After this reorganization, the Chinese army has not only increased in number, but has also greatly improved in quality, and various heavy weapons have been newly transported from the rear. It is learned that the Japanese army deployed along the Yangtze River numbers less than 20,000, while the Chinese army has about 100,000. Moreover, these Chinese troops have undergone several reorganizations and training, and most of them are strong and well-built. Currently, the generals in various counties in northern Jiangsu are loyal to the orders of Commander Gu of the Third War Area, determined to sacrifice to recover lost territory, so that they can see the light of day again and save the people from misery.</p>
<p>Rumors of Japanese Troops Landing in Hailufeng</p>
<p>Chaoshan and Hakka</p>
<p>Heard Telegram Stop Orders</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Vietnam line (i.e., Haikou, Beihai, Haiphong) operated by the British trading companies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire has been running for many years. Since the loss of Guanzhou, the two companies have also connected Guangzhou Bay, connecting the mainland. Last month, the Japanese Navy landed on Hainan Island, so the liners on the Shanghai-Vietnam line have stopped at Haikou and Beihai to avoid danger. As for Haiphong, it once stopped operating due to full warehouses, but it has now resumed. Yesterday, Butterfield &amp; Swire's Qiongzhou ship went to Shantou and Guangzhou Bay, carrying more than eighty pieces of cotton yarn. The other day (5th), Jardine Matheson's new vessel Yongsheng and Butterfield &amp; Swire's Suiyang will go to Haiphong. The Suiyang will also connect Guangzhou Bay and Beihai. Yesterday, it was rumored in Shanghai that Japanese troops had landed in Haifeng and Lufeng near Shantou. It is heard that some Chaoshan and Hakka merchants received telegrams to stop processing goods. Whether Japanese troops landed in Hailufeng has yet to be confirmed.</p>

<h3>Ready to Raise the Value of Legal Tender Further Confidence</h3>
<p>Fully Usable in North China and Guerrilla Areas</p>
<p>Circulation in Shanghai Reduced After Restrictions</p>
<p>Since the "United Reserve Bank" of the puppet regime in North China issued banknotes, attempting to exchange for legal tender and obtain foreign exchange failed, it used special forces to forcibly devalue legal tender in North China and stipulated that it would be prohibited from use from March 10th, aiming to disrupt our country's finances. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired with financial circles yesterday and learned that our country's legal tender issuance policy is particularly cautious. The cash reserve has increased after the war. As of the end of June last year, the Central Bank was at 67.4%, the Bank of China was at 65.2%, the Bank of Communications was at 60.4%, and the Farmers Bank of China was at 69.9%, all above 60%, in line with the issuance regulations, which is deeply trusted by Chinese and foreigners. Legal tender is always fully usable in the North China concession area and guerrilla areas. The issuance of legal tender has increased after the war compared to before the war, and the national financial system is becoming more stable. Shanghai's financial institutions have gradually become sound after a long period of evolution. However, the government has been making efforts to restrict the flow of legal tender into the occupied areas, stipulating regulations on the restriction of carrying banknotes, so the circulation of legal tender in Shanghai has decreased. In order to prevent legal tender from flowing into Shanghai, remittances from other ports to the Shanghai concession area are paid in drafts for large amounts. In addition, the Ministry of Finance's stipulation that public bonds should be paid interest in Chongqing is also to prevent large amounts of legal tender from flowing into Shanghai.</p>
<p>Italian Ambassador Visited Chamber of Commerce Commander Yesterday</p>
<p>Italian Ambassador to China Marquis Francesco Maria Taliani de Marchio, accompanied by Army Counselor Colonel Pier Francesco Parini, visited the commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Colonel Henry James Haywood yesterday morning on Fuzhou Road, where an honor guard from the Russian Company of the SVC paid respects.</p>

<h3>The False "Finance Minister of Jiangsu Province" Hao Peng Takes the Stage</h3>
<p>Recommended by the Japanese, Harada</p>
<p>Spent 100,000 Yuan on lobbying</p>
<p>The position of Finance Minister of the false Jiangsu Province was previously intended for Yan Jia'gan by the puppet Reformed Government (it is said that Yan is the younger brother of Yan Jiazhi, the chief of the Finance Department of the Reformed Government). However, Yan never took office. The position was then concurrently held by Chen Zemin, the puppet governor of the province. Now, after more than half a year, the Finance Department of the puppet Reformed Government has appointed Hao Peng to fill the position. It is understood that Hao was able to obtain this lucrative post due to the recommendation of Harada, a senior advisor to the puppet Reformed Government. It is said that Hao spent 100,000 yuan on lobbying. Hao is scheduled to make his debut in Jiangsu today (the 1st).</p>
<p>Frugality and Disaster Relief Association: Remitted 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Already Remitted 55,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Please Continue Your Efforts</p>
<p>The Frugality and Disaster Relief Committee, since its official establishment on October 10th of last year, has now been five months. Thanks to the enthusiastic advocacy of various sectors and schools, the results have been remarkable. On nine occasions, the frugality funds have been paid to the Refugee Relief Association for distribution, reaching 45,000 yuan. Yesterday, the tenth remittance was made, totaling 10,000 yuan in national currency, bringing the total remitted to 55,000 yuan. The association believes that persistence is the most important aspect of frugality and disaster relief. It continues to appeal to all sectors to continue their efforts. Those who have pledged to contribute should remit their contributions monthly as scheduled, without delay. Those who have not pledged should actively do so and immediately send their funds to the designated receiving banks in the city to obtain the official receipts issued by the association. This will cultivate a spirit of frugality among individuals and jointly overcome difficulties in the public sphere.</p>

<h3>The Feikang Arrives in Shanghai This Morning, The Four Arrested Passengers Have Not Been Released</h3>
<p>The German Consulate Strongly Protests, The Japanese Side Has Not Responded</p>
<p>Further Negotiations Will Continue After the Shipowner's Detailed Report</p>
<p>The Feikang, a vessel of the German firm Lürssen Shipping, departed from Shanghai at 7 a.m. on the 24th of last month, bound for Wenzhou. It was suddenly intercepted by a Japanese warship in the waters off Dinghai Island, outside the Wusong estuary, and four Chinese passengers were arrested. Afterwards, Lürssen Shipping reported the incident to the German Consulate, and the German Consul-General formally lodged a written protest with the Japanese side, demanding the immediate release of the arrested passengers, using rather strong language. However, as of yesterday, the Japanese Consulate had not responded, and the four arrested passengers had not been released. It is now learned that the Feikang, after sailing to Wenzhou, set sail back to Shanghai the day before yesterday and is expected to arrive this morning. The German Consulate will continue to negotiate with the Japanese side after receiving a detailed report from Captain Kerbe. The German business community believes that the incident infringed upon German sovereignty and obstructed legitimate business operations. At the same time, various foreign shipping companies are paying close attention to the case and its outcome, in order to jointly take appropriate steps to prevent similar incidents from recurring and to safeguard their navigation rights and interests in China.</p>

<h3>The Third of March Friends' Festival, Huang Jingwan's Letter to Poor Friends</h3>
<p>Tomorrow (March 3rd) is the sixth Chinese Friends' Festival. As usual, celebrations will be held to commemorate it. The initiator, Mr. Huang Jingwan, believes that this year, with the national crisis still severe and friends scattered, there is no reason for joy. He hopes that his patriotic friends and overseas compatriots will publicly swear not to be slaves, to make equality of personality the sole goal, to do more to benefit the world, and to strive for human happiness. The following is the letter from Mr. Huang to poor friends in the interior: "Time flies so fast. It's the sixth Friends' Festival on March 3rd again in a blink of an eye. Usually, the Friends' Festival is the most</p>
<p>celebrated</p>
<p>of festivals, celebrated when spring arrives and is kind and amiable. However, this year, the national crisis is still extremely serious. We should maintain our usual caution, solemnity, and activity throughout the day. But if we open our eyes to look at the current reality, the iron hooves of the invaders are trampling on countless of our homeland, cruelly killing countless</p>
<p>compatriots</p>
<p>under their mad devil hands, looting countless of our property, and destroying countless of our houses and fields. Today, we, a group of people who are fortunate enough to have sought refuge on an isolated island, although able to live a not-so-difficult life, can still freely welcome this Friends' Festival. In normal times, the ancients would say that one should think of danger in times of peace. In the current severe national crisis, how should we think of the suffering of the people in the interior? Everyone hopes that the record of their life will become</p>
<p>more splendid.</p>
<p>A wrong path is of course what people with souls will never want to take, so they can only seek comfort in the spirit, say a few auspicious words, and make a joke to cheer themselves up. My heart is my own master, where is not a place for physical exercise, a place for patience, and resources for cultivation? All joys and sorrows, partings and reunions, are all created by the heart. Being a resident in the occupied area, hardships and difficulties are unavoidable. If you are determined not to be slaves, you can only endure adversity and bite your teeth, enduring all the greater hardships, and being pressed by</p>
<p>material inducements and force</p>
<p>without yielding. There is no question of seeking ease and pleasure now. Disappointment and decadence are not worthy of being good sons and daughters. Sincerity can penetrate metal and stone. I hope that poor friends in the interior will help themselves and each other. After each encounter with a setback, after each encounter with difficulties, you should strengthen your beliefs even more deeply. When you have strong confidence and also have the determination to obey authority, so that confidence and determination are mutual trust and recognition of authority,</p>
<p>all success</p>
<p>will be realized. Because of this time of suffering, one can test the rise and fall of personality, see who can truly love the country and who is falsely patriotic and only does superficial work. Poor friends in the interior, I think that on this happy Friends' Festival, most of you will have no heart to rejoice, but there is no need to be discouraged or dispirited and become passive. Cheer up quickly, how diligent and vigilant, in order to repay the motherland. Now, in what is called an extraordinary period, being an educated</p>
<p>intellectual,</p>
<p>whether as a teacher, politician, businessman, worker, doctor, lawyer, engineer, accountant, etc., should understand what one's own responsibility is, not to sing high-sounding tunes or shout slogans, but to do things truly and practically. Although we are on an isolated island and cannot go to the front to defend against the enemy or serve in the rear, doing some charitable work, promoting proper entertainment, using domestic goods, fulfilling our duties in production, and frugality in saving the country, etc., are also ways of being patriotic, because fulfilling one's duty to the country and the idea of patriotism are multifaceted and vary according to time and place, and are not absolute. A new era is coming, may all our poor friends prepare for new efforts."</p>
<p>The Post Office Resumes Acceptance of Parcels to Yunnan Province</p>
<p>Transportation Difficulties May Prevent Long-Term Service</p>
<p>Suspension May Occur Again Within Days</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration previously suspended the acceptance of small and large parcels destined for Kunming and Yunnan Province, along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, due to traffic obstructions and transportation delays, resulting in a mountain of accumulated parcels. Now, in order to ease the difficulties of merchants and facilitate the flow of goods to other places, the Bureau has decided to resume acceptance of small parcels destined for Kunming and Yunnan Province, along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, starting yesterday. Each parcel is limited to 20 kilograms, and the charging methods are detailed. As for large parcels, it is still difficult to resume acceptance. However, the number of parcels destined for the above-mentioned areas is quite large, and it is feared that the service may not be sustainable. According to the person in charge of the Bureau, suspension may occur again within days.</p>

<h3>The Mystery of the Missing Russian Boy: Family Refuses to Release Any Information, Rumors Say the Boy Went to Chongqing to Join the Chinese Army</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, the 12-year-old son of Mr. Strilezov, a well-known Soviet expatriate in Shanghai, disappeared two weeks ago. As of last night (the 28th), the mystery remains unsolved. Mr. and Mrs. Strilezov and the French Concession Police Department have refused to release any information on the case, as there have been widespread rumors in the past two weeks about an important "political kidnapping" in Shanghai. The reporter then called Mrs. Strilezov yesterday to inquire, and she</p>
<p>personally confirmed</p>
<p>the boy's disappearance. It is said that Mr. Strilezov is the agent manager of a certain Soviet import and export company, and Mrs. Strilezov is the director of the TASS News Agency in Shanghai. Since the boy's disappearance, they have not received any news and still do not know where he is. Mrs. Strilezov refused to disclose her son's name, only saying that they hoped to avoid publicizing the matter. The place and time where the boy was last seen were</p>
<p>also not certain.</p>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening News also reported that after the disappearance of the fifteen-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. Strilezov, residents of White Racecourse Road, five radio stations broadcast announcements in search of him a few days ago, but without success. Some believe that Mr. Strilezov's son</p>
<p>secretly left his home</p>
<p>to join the Chinese army in Chongqing. It is said that the young man was a student at the Municipal Council Western Boys' School. He was not seen at school two weeks ago, and it was then learned that he had disappeared.</p>
<p>Tofu Shop: The Mistress Runs Away</p>
<p>Escaping with the shop's money with a shop assistant</p>
<p>Caught by her husband and sent to court for investigation</p>
<p>Yu Ziyun, a native of Ningbo, is over thirty years old. He has been running a tofu shop at 141 Market Street in the French Concession for many years. Ten years ago, he married Ms. Pan, a fellow villager, through a matchmaker. Ms. Pan is now twenty-seven years old and enjoys a dissolute lifestyle. In recent years, she has had an affair with Yu A'xi, a shop assistant (twenty-five years old this year). On the first day of the first lunar month, Ms. Pan took 300 yuan in cash and three gold rings from the shop and ran away with her lover Yu A'xi,</p>
<p>living together</p>
<p>in a room at the Yong'an Hotel on Maigen Road in the Public Concession.</p>
<p>After his wife ran away with the money, Yu Ziyun searched everywhere. He finally found out where Ms. Pan was hiding the day before yesterday and arrested the adulterous couple Yu A'xi and Ms. Pan and handed them over to the French Concession Police for investigation. Yesterday afternoon at around 3 p.m., the French police sent Yu A'xi and Ms. Pan to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District, stating that the defendants were suspected of</p>
<p>conspiring to steal</p>
<p>and requesting detention for investigation. Judge Qiu Huan-ying interrogated them, and the defendant Ms. Pan confessed that she had been married to Yu Ziyun for ten years and had been subjected to abuse by her husband. This was why she had to take 300 yuan in cash and gold rings and stay in a hotel, intending to find work outside and support herself. More than 100 yuan of the money she took out was taken by Yu A'xi.</p>
<p>Most of it was lost in gambling.</p>
<p>There was still 198 yuan left, which was confiscated by the police. Most of the gold rings were also taken by Yu A'xi and pawned for use. Yu A'xi then confessed that Ms. Pan spent a lot of money in the hotel in six days. He only had a few meals with her and did not use much of her money. Although he gambled during the New Year, he did not use her money. The plaintiff Yu Ziyun then recounted the details of his wife's escape and arrest, requesting that they be punished according to the law. The court asked Yu A'xi, you were a shop assistant in Yu Ziyun's shop, but you took the boss's wife</p>
<p>to open a room.</p>
<p>This is not right in law or morality. What else do you have to say? Yu A'xi replied that Ms. Pan took the initiative in this matter. The court verified the statements and ordered that the defendants be detained and re-examined on March 8th. The confiscated stolen money of 198 yuan and the stolen gold rings were returned to the original owner, Yu Ziyun. The two defendants, Yu A'xi and Ms. Pan, were then taken away by the bailiffs for detention.</p>
<h3>Anle Cotton Mill Robbed, Bandits Shot and Killed Chinese Police Officer, Mill Robbed of More Than 3,000 Yuan, Chinese Police Officer Xu Xiaotong Died from Gunshot Wound</h3>
<p>Anle Cotton Mill, located at 34 Love Street, Bailinan Road, West Shanghai, was founded by Deng Zhonghe, a cotton cloth merchant, and has a distribution office on Nanjing Road. The business is doing well. Yesterday at 11:30 a.m., just as the factory was opening its doors and workers were leaving for lunch, eight bandits suddenly broke in to rob. Four of the bandits were armed with guns. Two bandits with guns guarded the factory gate, preventing anyone from moving. The remaining six bandits, led by two gunmen, entered the factory and found the factory accountant, immediately taking him to the accounting room and forcing him to hand over the keys to all the silver cabinets. The accountant refused in every possible way, but was eventually searched by force. All the cash stored inside, more than 3,000 yuan in silver dollars, was robbed. The bandits then rushed out of the gate to escape. Unexpectedly, at that moment, Chinese police officer Xu Xiaotong, No. 2067, was patrolling and was passing the temporary isolation hospital of the Municipal Council and was about to reach the factory gate. The bandits were also escaping to the factory gate. When they saw the Chinese police officer, they thought the case had been exposed and immediately drew their guns and opened fire on the police officer, firing five or six shots. When Officer Xu heard the gunshots, he knew something was wrong and was about to draw his gun to shoot back, but his head and left temple had already been shot, and his chest was also injured by the bullets. He immediately fell to the ground. The service pistol he was holding was robbed by the bandits, who escaped without a trace. By the time a large number of detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station arrived after hearing the alarm, the bandits had already escaped far away. They immediately imposed martial law in the area from Zhaofeng Park and Yuyuan Road to Bailinan Road, and searched pedestrians and vehicles, but found nothing. Xu, the police officer, was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment, but because he was seriously injured, he died. Currently, the police are investigating the case.</p>
<h3>Doing Good Is the Greatest Joy: The General Police Department Busts a "Landing Pickpocket" Gang, Detains More Than a Dozen Members of the Gang, Including "Pigsy," and Sends Them to the First Special Court to Await Rescheduled Trial</h3>
<p>Zhang Mingde, head of the Chinese Detective Bureau of the General Police Department, detectives Yang Zhaoqing, Qian Xianting, Cheng Renkun, etc., learned that someone had recently organized a large-scale "landing pickpocket" theft organization, including both men and women. Every day, they rented a rickshaw and did not solicit passengers, but only patrolled the roadside with male and female accomplices. Whenever they saw a small cart or tiger cart full of goods passing by without anyone guarding the cart, the female accomplices would step forward and pretend to ask for directions, shifting the rickshaw driver's attention to the woman. The other accomplices would then take the opportunity to steal the goods on the cart, load them onto the parked rickshaw, and speed away. Countless people have been victimized. The detectives learned that these people were going to use the same trick in Huajinli, Shanxi Road, the day before yesterday afternoon, so they rushed to wait. Before long, Jin Gengsheng (aka Pigsy) from Suzhou, Sun Chuanhe (aka Old Chopsticks) from Xuzhou, Zhang A'gen (aka Little Hebei) from Nanjing, Xie Mingshun from Zhejiang, and Sun Li, a woman from Pudong, appeared, and they were arrested together and taken back to the police station. After questioning, they confessed that their organization was located in Room 208 of the Southern Hotel at 462 Jiujiang Road. The detectives then went to arrest Zhang Yanming from Inatsu, Jia Zhengcai (aka Dahua) from Nanjing, Wang A'gen (aka Wang Liu) from Jiangbei, Yu Jiada (aka Dahong), Liu Fuzi (aka Xu Shucai), Ding Yuting (aka Huazi), Yao Gonghuan (aka Candle), Wu Damao (aka Yinde), Tang Bangrong (aka Daluzi), Chen Binke (aka Little Mapi), Shi Guanghui, Zhu Liucai, Zhang Maoliang, women Wang Xiuying, Jin Lushi, Xu Mao, etc., totaling sixteen people. Ten pieces of cloth, one box of soap, more than fifty pawn tickets, and more than seventy yuan in legal currency were seized. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process, stating that because there were many criminals involved in the case and investigation would take time, he requested permission for temporary detention and rescheduling of the hearing. After questioning by Judge Xiao Fenfen, the defendants were ordered to be detained and the hearing was rescheduled.</p>
<h3>Rice Shop Employee Infatuated with Gambling</h3>
<p>Accused of Embezzling Funds</p>
<p>Sentenced to Eight Months in Prison</p>
<p>Ding Changyao, a 40-year-old employee of the Baotai Xin Rice Shop at 209 Market Street, French Concession, was suspended for forging checks and embezzling funds. Later, the owner of the rice shop, Zhou Langen, allowed him to write a letter of repentance and resume work because he thought his life was difficult. Unexpectedly, on January 5, Ding embezzled 826 yuan of funds again. Zhou discovered this a few days ago and reported it to the police, who arrested Ding. Ding Changyao was escorted by the police to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District yesterday and prosecuted for embezzlement. Judge Liao presided over the interrogation, and the defendant Ding Changyao confessed to embezzling 819 yuan of funds, saying that he lost money gambling in West Shanghai and could not make up for it, so he embezzled the money and asked for leniency. The plaintiff, Zhou Langen, came to court and stated the details of the defendant Ding Changyao's embezzlement, requesting that he be punished according to law and ordered to repay the embezzled 826 yuan. The lawyer for the French Concession Police stated his opinion, saying that the defendant's crime was not motivated by hunger and cold, but by a love of gambling, and should be punished severely according to law. Judge Liao verified the statements, concluded the debate, and announced the verdict in court: Ding Changyao was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment for embezzlement, and the attached civil lawsuit part was transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial.</p>
<h3>Strange Flower Sedan, Bride Missing</h3>
<p>Zhao, a farmer who lived in Lujiaxing, Pudong, left behind a wife, a son, and a daughter. The brother had already married. The younger sister, named A'si, is now nineteen years old and cultivates the land with her mother every day. Years ago, she was promised to a Yuan family in the same village through a matchmaker, and received a betrothal gift of 180 yuan. Because the family was poor, the gift had already been used up by her brother and sister-in-law. This year, the Yuan family found that both sides were of age and eagerly wanted to complete the marriage. They chose the eighth day of the first lunar month for the wedding and sent a tea gift of 100 yuan for the second time. However, A'si was stubborn and could not raise the 180 yuan spent on the first betrothal gift. The 100 yuan for the second gift was not enough to buy dowry, and the countryside was not peaceful, so she could not borrow any money. She was afraid that she would not be able to face her parents-in-law after her marriage. On that day, the sedan chair from the Yuan family arrived, but the bride was nowhere to be found. The Yuan family was embarrassed by the delay and left the sedan chair at the Zhao family. Yesterday was the third day, and the bride had not returned. The Yuan family lost both the bride and the money and felt resentful. Over the past two days, they have sent people to the Zhao family to negotiate, but it is not known how it will be resolved.</p>
<h3>Patriotic Youth Organizations Never Stay in the Concession, Nor Do They Contact the Outside World Under Any Name</h3>
<p>The atmosphere in the city's concessions has been tense recently. The Japanese side is using the issue of terrorism as an excuse to negotiate with the Municipal Council authorities. However, unscrupulous people in the city are taking this opportunity to impersonate personnel from the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government or representatives of the Ministry of Military Affairs, using the name of eliminating traitors and distributing anonymous letters in an attempt to intimidate and defraud. Recently, someone received a private letter from Hong Kong discussing the issue of the Shanghai concessions, stating that since the fall of Greater Shanghai, many young people in the rear have organized patriotic organizations to secretly go to the lost areas to assassinate traitors. However, these young people are pure and loyal individuals. After each successful mission, they immediately retreated to the rear or went to the guerrilla areas, never staying in the concessions, and absolutely never contacting the outside world under any name. True patriotic youth organizations would never bother to do this.</p>
<h3>An Eighty-Year-Old Woman Commits Suicide: Distraught Over Loss of Both Wealth and Family, Suffering Mental Breakdown, Crying, Refusing to Eat, Secretly Taking Poison</h3>
<p>In Hangzhou, an elderly woman named Ge Qishi, aged seventy-nine, resided in Yuehua Fang, Huade Road. Her son passed away nine years ago, leaving behind a widowed daughter-in-law, Wan Shi, and her eldest grandson, Songwu. They had been working in Hangzhou, but in January of last year, due to the fall of Hangzhou, the daughter-in-law, grandson, and three others moved all their belongings to a Dong family house in Shijiatang, Lanxi. Unexpectedly, the landlord’s relative, Shao Baotang, from Dongyang, who runs the Shaoyuantai ham shop outside Matou, Jinhua, became acquainted with Wan Shi through a Ms. Lei’s introduction. Shao Baotang advised Wan Shi, saying, "Lanxi is dangerous; moving elsewhere would be safer." Mistakenly believing Shao to be a good person, she moved all the boxes of belongings to Shao's warehouse at No. 2 Gaojing Lane, Jinhua, and lived together. Shao seduced her into adultery. The eldest grandson, Songwu, aged twenty-one, was, in the second month, tricked by Shao into joining the army in Jiangxi as a new recruit, removing a thorn in his side. Until this year, there has been no news of him, and his fate is unknown. In [month], Shao’s wife learned about the affair with Wan Shi and rushed back to Jinhua from Shandong to make a scene. Wan Shi was severely beaten by Shao and driven out. She came to report to her mother-in-law about the significant losses. The old woman, realizing her daughter-in-law had been deceived and fallen ill, and deeply missing her grandson, suffered a sudden mental breakdown, crying and refusing to eat all day long. The night before last, she secretly took opium and committed suicide. Neighbors discovered this and immediately sent her to Shuren Hospital for treatment. Due to her advanced age, she is still in critical condition.</p>
<p>Employees' Communication Office of Two Railways Develops Relief Work</p>
<p>The employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Ningbo Railways, having lost their livelihoods since the cessation of railway operations, the Communication Office, representing all employees, requested to borrow a portion of their savings in May of last year, amounting to 300,000 national currency. This was approved by the authorities, and the funds were distributed equally among the employees as a form of relief. In December of last year, another 200,000 in fixed deposits matured, and the Communication Office, entrusted by the employees, made a second request. The authorities in Shanghai also took the plight of the employees into consideration and approved the release of funds according to the same borrowing method as before. The savings issue has now come to a close. The office is now focusing on relief efforts, retaining Dr. Gu Puquan, a doctor with a long history of service in the railways, as the medical director. They have also hired Mr. Peng Youwen from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Hygiene Department as an assistant, and have stocked up on various medicines and raw materials. Starting March 1st, they will continue to provide medical treatment for colleagues and their families from both railways at the original address. Surgery is available from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and internal medicine is available from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM. In addition to medical services, the office is also planning to continue providing credit loans, and handling communication and other relief matters. The office's efforts to promote the welfare of railway colleagues are truly commendable.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, I recently read in your newspaper on February 27 that Kong Wendou, who opened the Heli Flower Association at Zhujia Ku, Haige Road, led a crowd to destroy the Yongli Flower Association with guns and shot and injured a boy. I was surprised to read this. Wen Bao'an has been doing business and has never interfered with disputes. Not only has he not participated in the above-mentioned incident, but he has not even heard of it. Even if it is true, I think it is a mistake passed on by someone with the same name. It is absolutely unrelated to me. I am afraid that there will be slander from the outside world, so I specially wrote a letter to you, asking your newspaper to correct it quickly to show the truth. I wish you peace. Sincerely, Kong Wenbao, February 28, residing in Tianfu Store, Zhujia Ku, Haige Road.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, According to the person involved, Mr. Liu Zheran, on the 27th of this month, there was a news item in the Shanghai newspaper about the spread of opium in western Shanghai. It said that the local trafficker Jiang Yumen colluded with his fellow townsman Liu Zheran to organize a general bureau for selling opium, and paid 100,000 yuan in security to the Japanese side to obtain the exclusive right to sell drugs. After reading it, I was very surprised. Since the outbreak of the war, I have not heard of anything other than managing grains and transportation business. The so-called selling of opium is even more nonexistent. The news report was inaccurate, and it was obvious that someone maliciously slandered and fabricated facts with the intention of harming others. The matter is of great importance, and it is difficult to remain silent. Therefore, in addition to entrusting a thorough investigation in accordance with the law and publishing a statement in the newspaper, I would like to ask a representative to send a letter to the newspaper office requesting a correction. Accordingly, I will do my best to convey it. I hope you will check and take care of it. Sincerely, to the editorial department of Shenbao, lawyer Chen Chou.</p>
<p>Correction: In a news item yesterday entitled "The Progress of Disguised Exchanges," it was stated that Datong Company was reorganized after the failure of the previous illegal exchange and sold British and American gold tickets in name, and carried out disguised exchanges, ignoring laws and disrupting the market. It is now clarified that the company is absolutely unrelated to the previous illegal exchange. The company's organization is not a trust company. The business purpose is to sell various domestic and foreign commodities and real estate in this city and other places, as well as various insurances. It is definitely not just selling British and American gold tickets. It is a legitimate business, organized in accordance with the law, and there is absolutely no place similar to an exchange. Special correction.</p>

<p>China Electric Shares Have Demand and No Sales</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in the off-exchange securities market was weak with a hint of firmness. Although there were still dealers on the market who intended to suppress the small market price, there were also quite a few parties taking advantage of the low prices to absorb shares. The establishment of new loans and the discounting of public bond interest coupons will be realized one after another. After the resolution of the Western war, the atmosphere of Sino-Japanese peace is becoming increasingly strong. It is faintly heard that the exchange authorities will go to Hong Kong within days to hold concrete discussions on the issue of resumption of business. The official opening should not be far away. Whenever there are sellers suppressing the small market price in the market, the buying parties will take advantage of the low prices to absorb shares. This kind of method is fiercely competitive in secret, so the future has great changes. Yesterday, after the opening, No. 5 bought No. 38 C-type shares, and Tongkang and Lianhehao also had considerable absorption. The market price was firm and stable. Afterwards, there were still sales at 46, in a relatively large number, deliberately suppressing the small market price. Later, retail investors and Tongkang Tianshenghao and No. 15 took advantage of the low prices to absorb shares, and it rebounded slightly. The scope of the seven falls was very small. As a result, it continued to be one jiao and a half to five jiao and a half smaller than the previous day. The total number of transactions was estimated to be 670,000 yuan. The brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 5 yuan and 7 jiao and a half. It is heard that the company's surplus is 4 million, and in addition to compensating for the loss, there is still interest to be paid. China Bank shares were offered at 57 yuan and several jiao, and China Merchants Electric shares were priced at 5 yuan and 1 jiao, but there were no shares.</p>
<p>On the 28th of last month (Tuesday), the listed market prices of London's Chinese foreign currency bonds showed slight fluctuations up and down. The tariff-guaranteed Sino-French American gold 5% public bonds, printed bonds, and British gold rehabilitation public bonds, British-issued bonds, continued to fall by half a pound. The former was priced at 66 pounds, and the latter was priced at 48 pounds and a half. The Crispo public bonds and Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway public bonds each rose by half a pound. The former was priced at 35 pounds, and the latter was priced at 19 pounds. The rest remained unchanged. In the London physical market supply and sale, there were 2,000 pounds of Sino-French American gold 5% public bonds (i.e. US$10,000), selling price was 66 pounds, 12 shillings and 6 pence, according to the market, raised 12 shillings and 6 pence, and 2,000 pounds of Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway public bonds, selling price was 18 pounds, according to the market, pressed down one pound, and 1,000 pounds of Beijing-Shanghai Railway public bonds, selling price was 25 pounds, according to the market, raised two pounds.</p>
<p>On the 28th of last month (Tuesday), the listed market prices of London British-owned companies' shares showed slight fluctuations up and down in bank shares. The Mackay Bank shares continued to fall by 2 shillings and 6 pence, priced at 9 pounds and 5 shillings, and the HSBC Bank's London-registered shares rose by one pound and a half, priced at 86 pounds and a half. The Hong Kong-registered shares also rose by half a pound, priced at 88 pounds and a half. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Standard Oak Shares Pay Dividends</p>
<p>Yesterday, Xiangmao Foreign Firm, the manager of Standard Oak Limited in this city, announced that the company's 1938 surplus was 73,484.98 yuan in national currency, added to the previous session's carried-over 7,241.27 yuan in national currency, totaling 80,726.25 yuan in national currency. The board of directors proposed a surplus distribution plan, deciding to pay a dividend of 1 jiao and 5 fen per share in national currency, totaling 53,054.70 yuan in national currency, and to amortize depreciation items such as houses and brine wells, totaling 14,687.98 yuan in national currency, with a remaining 12,983.57 yuan in national currency to be carried over to the next session. The dividend payment must be approved by the shareholders' meeting on the 17th of this month before a fixed date can be scheduled.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: The First Bustling Day Since the New Year - Over 5,000 Bales of Cotton Yarn Transacted</h3>
<p>A Four Yuan Jump in an Instant</p>
<p>After lingering for several days, the yarn market, now boosted by the development of customer sales, has shown signs of recovery. Buyers from Nanhua and Yunnan are actively purchasing, acquiring a total of 1,200 bales of both coarse and fine yarn. Although the fine yarn business in the north has been encroached upon by other yarns, the demand for coarse yarn remains strong and continuous. Consequently, industry players, who were already anticipating price increases, are now further supported by actual demand, causing market prices to rise even higher. Some are even rushing to buy in the market, indicating a strong bullish sentiment. As a result, 20-count Double Horse yarn, initially priced at 395 yuan, quickly jumped by five yuan to 400 yuan.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Yunnan group bought 740 bales of 20-count Golden Rooster yarn and 230 bales of 10-count Dafa yarn, which stirred the market sentiment. The future lies in discovering new peaks, contingent on the volume of actual sales. In the afternoon, the atmosphere was enthusiastic, with a unified rush to purchase, pushing Double Horse yarn beyond the 400-yuan mark.</p>
<p>Industry Players' Pace Quite Chaotic</p>
<p>Regarding the current yarn situation, the opening market in the morning was relatively stable, with little change from the previous day and no price adjustments. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn remained at 395 yuan. Shortly after, news of activity from southern customer groups, coupled with substantial demand, suddenly tightened the market, and prices steadily rose. Buyers from Tianjin also purchased coarse yarn, and major industry players absorbed available stock certificates, further tightening the market situation. The closing price for 20-count Double Horse yarn reached 400 yuan. In the afternoon, both northern and southern customer groups continued to transact actual deals, amounting to over 1,000 bales. This strengthened the confidence of industry players, leading to more frequent and varied actions, causing market prices to become chaotic and inconsistent. This demonstrates a lack of coordination among industry participants. It is reported that the total transaction volume for the day reached a substantial 5,030 bales, marking the first bustling day since the New Year.</p>
<p>Market Fluctuations Today</p>
<p>With the market rising and the bullish trend strong, market sources indicate that industry players, anticipating future sales growth, are actively making precautionary transactions. The difference between the opening and closing price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 7.75 yuan. Based on this situation, if current sales continue to be strong, there may be further price increases tomorrow; otherwise, there may be a reversal due to excessive upward pressure. It is reported that the total transaction volume for the day was 5,030 bales, with inter-dealer transactions accounting for 2,000 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn increased by 7.75 yuan compared to the previous day, Double Globe by 6 yuan, Heavenly Maiden by 7 yuan, Special Golden City by 5 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn by 3 yuan. The transaction volume for each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Factories Seize the Opportunity to Increase Output</p>
<p>With the sharp rise in cotton yarn prices, factories are seizing the opportunity to increase output to meet customer demand. Dasheng is increasing output of 10-count Red Kui Xing, Qinfeng Factory is increasing output of 10-count Red Double Whale, Zhenhua Factory is increasing output of 10-count Double Dragon, Tongyi Factory is increasing output of 20-count Golden Rooster, Chongxin Factory is increasing output of 10-count Dafa, and Xinyu Factory is increasing output of 16-count Double Globe. The total output of coarse and fine yarn from various factories is 2,670 bales, mostly purchased by the Yunnan group, while the Tianjin group mainly purchased 10-count coarse yarn. The count and prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Japanese Yarn Also Driven Higher</p>
<p>Although the Japanese yarn market is quiet, the continuous rise of Chinese yarn has inevitably stirred sentiment, leading to a price increase of 2-3 yuan. The current price of 20-count Water Moon yarn is 336-337 yuan, and the current price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 330 yuan.</p>
<p>Stimulated by the Country's Increased Import Tax on Foreign Cotton - Indian Cotton Base Price Soars</p>
<h3>Stimulated by the Country's Increased Import Tax on Foreign Cotton - Indian Cotton Base Price Soars</h3>
<p>Lancashire Representative Goes to the United States</p>
<p>To Discuss Loan Cotton Solutions</p>
<p>Regarding foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market benefited from favorable Liverpool communications and widespread rumors that Lancashire mills, the gathering place of British yarn factories, were feeling the shortage of American cotton. This is because what can currently be bought in the United States is all inferior American cotton, while the superior cotton has already been loaned to the government. Due to the difficulty in purchasing American cotton, Lancashire plans to request the US government to release this loan inventory as soon as possible. A representative has already set off for the United States to discuss solutions with US Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace. The fabric trade is improving daily, with a massive 36 million yards sold in the past four days, boosting morale. The New York cotton market has been rising for two consecutive weeks, and yesterday it rose another 4-9 British pounds, India rose more than half a rupee, and Egypt rose 3-4 British pounds.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading, in the past few days, due to the inability to relax exchange rates, coupled with overseas cotton rising day by day, American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose another 4 jiao per dan yesterday, and Egyptian rose more than 3 jiao. Because Indian cotton is cheap, and all countries are competing to buy it, especially Shanghai, Indian yarn factories even tend to use foreign cotton. The government is deeply concerned that this situation is extremely detrimental to India's economy. Therefore, yesterday, an order was issued to change the foreign cotton import tax rules. From March 1st, foreign cotton imports will be charged double the original tax rate to show restriction. The short-fiber of Indian cotton is quite surplus in the country, because of the particularly high output. However, due to the small output of long-fiber, the basic price of Pingguoer · Oumola, which can be used as raw material for 10-count to 20-count, rose by half a yuan per dan in yesterday's Indian telegram. However, the base price of Bailuoqu · American Xinnt and American Penggapu, which can be used as raw materials for 24-count and above, surged by 2 yuan to more than 4 yuan per dan. As a result, yesterday's foreign cotton trading was very quiet. However, according to general observation, the soaring base price of Indian cotton may be temporarily stimulated by the increased import tax, and may fall back to a certain extent in the future; otherwise, Indian cotton will be difficult to compete with American cotton. The prices of cotton converted into legal currency prices delivered to the factory yesterday are listed below:</p>
<p>Yao Cotton Arrives Again - More Than 20,000 Pieces - Transactions Remain Desolate</p>
<p>The domestic cotton business is still very deserted, but the selling price is very firm, because the stock is exhausted. According to cotton merchants, the accumulation of inferior goods in various production areas has not been exhausted, but it is subject to a certain party's control, the donation fees and miscellaneous taxes are high, and the transportation is particularly difficult, so the source layer has a vague future. Therefore, the cotton market seems to be creating a situation of "having a market but no sales". It is hoped that the source from Subei will be after the Lantern Festival. Yao cotton has been approved for release, and shipments arrive from time to time. Yesterday, 26,698 pieces were shipped from Ningbo. The current transaction volume and market price of cotton are listed below:</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Popular Light-Colored Cloth - Active Current Sales - The East Piece Goods Market Remains Strong</h3>
<p>Domestic cloth of popular light colors are selling well, including striped and plain poplin, bleached cloth, bleached twill, standard cloth, and white printed cloth. There is active demand from northern and southern customer groups. Raw cotton fabrics such as light and heavy coarse cloth have also seen large transactions recently. Postal delivery to Sichuan and Chengdu has recently resumed, and the Yunnan group is still purchasing urgently needed goods and waiting for ships to load and ship. Therefore, popular light-colored piece goods remain firm, while dark-colored goods remain stagnant. The market also has its ups and downs, with white goods and coarse cloth being the strongest. The dyeing factories on this street still have stagnant demand for fine twill and fine cloth. The morning market continued to fall by five cents to one jiao, but rebounded slightly in the afternoon. The Guangdong and Zhejiang-Jiangxi groups purchased more than 100 packages of fine cloth, and Subei purchased more than 10 packages. Light-colored cloth is more popular in Sichuan, Yunnan, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi, with transactions reaching more than 6,000 bolts. Fuyu and Dongtai in northern Jiangsu also added more than 1,000 bolts of bleached cloth and poplin.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth continues to be firm. Dyeing factories on this street and industry players continue to purchase fine cloth and fine twill, with continued transactions of thousands of pieces, and the selling market is becoming more upright. Fine cloth with the Yanghe brand is the hardest, with each bolt priced about one jiao higher. Other brands such as Colorful Ball and Flying Fish have more circulating pieces due to the flow of industry brand names, so they are mediocre. Therefore, the price of fine cloth in yesterday's market was quite uneven, while the actual demand for fine twill increased, and each bolt rose uniformly by one jiao. The wholesale price of white goods is still high, and no one is interested. There are thousands of pieces of 12-pound Colorful Ball futures fine cloth opened by internal and external factories, with the price of each bolt at 12.306 yuan, including factory tax. Due to the shortage of patterns in spot goods, although the market is high, continued opening is carried out. Yesterday, Dongmian and other firms opened more than 200 boxes of printed linen yarn, satin, poplin and soft flannel, with printed linen yarn at 3.45 cents per yard, printed poplin at 3.7 cents per yard, and light-colored satin at 8.9 yuan per bolt.</p>
<p>Camel Down Wool Foreign Goods Groups Selling Well</p>
<p>Yesterday's woolen cloth trading was still lively. Unfortunately, in addition to pullover goods, ordinary and inexpensive Chinese and Western clothing materials are extremely scarce. Domestic camel down wool, with artistic stripes and plain colors, has a large transaction volume. Foreign goods groups have more intake than woolen cloth groups, because their market sales are strong, the profit is thinner than that of woolen cloth shops, and the scale is disturbing, so customers mostly adopt this product, while woolen cloth door shops are mostly embellishments. The matching of new spring, loose and tight camel down wool and woolen cloth door shops is far less complete and prosperous than that of silk and satin foreign goods shops, and most of their business has been taken away by foreign goods door groups. Yesterday, the wholesale price of the top camel down wool was 3.75 yuan per yard, the first grade was 3.25 yuan, the second grade was 2.25 yuan, the third grade was 1.85 yuan, and the fourth grade was 1.56 yuan. The actual sales of third- and fourth-grade lower-end goods are booming.</p>
<h3>Grain: Customs Has Said to Levy Import Tax - Du Geng and Ke Xian Fly Together</h3>
<p>Hoarding Households and Shop Stomachs Are Actively Importing</p>
<p>The consignors took the opportunity to hoard and tighten the prices</p>
<p>As for the source of domestic rice, only No. 3 arrived at Hexia, with two or three thousand bags of car-transported packages. The sales market heard that the customs had said that it would levy import tax, and coupled with the limited sources, people's hearts soared. Large hoarding households and local shop stomachs are all lively. The sellers took the opportunity to raise the prices, and the situation was lively. For today's geng, the market has increased sharply. For example, the thick geng market has increased by 1-2 jiao, and the special thin rice bag has soared by 3 jiao. The Hexia goods have also increased by 2 jiao. The prices of Du Yang sharp tip and Bu tip seem to have not risen or fallen, and the middle price has brought a good price increase. The Yinwu to the road continues to be strong, and the supply is short, and it will rise by another 2 jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the hoarding of Ke Xian by this Kehang was strong, while the consignors had the intention of hoarding and were unwilling to easily sell. The reason is that yesterday, each rice of the rice Jian in Hexia rose in unison. In addition, there is still a rumor in the market that the customs will automatically unban it, in order to avoid private statements and increase tax revenue, and that rice from the mainland will be taxed. Although the above two rumors have not been confirmed, everyone is heading upwards, and Ke Xian is being competed for by all parties. The total transaction volume for the day was about 4,000 bags, and the price rose by 2 jiao compared with the previous day. The price of Nanjing Xian Chongyangjian was 12 yuan, and the price of high-quality Wu Xian was also 11.5 yuan.</p>
<p>16,000 bags of white rice will be exported to Ningbo in the next two days, and it is said that another 34,000 bags are waiting to be loaded.</p>
<p>Flour Sales Gradually Stagnant - The Wholesale Price in This Street Has Been Reduced by 5 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the current flour situation was loose and tired. Since the No. 2 flour mill disk has been reduced by 5 points from the red disk, it has been a week, but the wholesale price in this street still needs 4.8 yuan. As reported earlier in this newspaper, yesterday's market in the north and south was decorated with sporadic sprinkles, which was not lonely, but large transactions were rarely accepted. This street is generally in a state of not accepting small quantities because the Yang flour from Supri is dumped and the Muke factory disk is 5 points different. Therefore, starting yesterday, the Benke factory disk uniformly opened the price of 4.75 yuan, and the total number of No. 2 flours sold in the market was about 30,000 bags. Except for the 7-8,000 bags wholesaled in this street, the rest were sporadically handled by Yanjin, Fushan and other places, and the market was unusually excited.</p>
<p>The wheat market is unremarkable, and the source and inventory are lacking. The foreign wheat previously set by the factory is due to the delay of the ship and the arrival of the goods is pending, so the seller's intention is very firm, and it will not be sold without rising. However, each factory has foreign wheat applications, and is unwilling to release the price to handle it, and the market is held as before. The city only opened a package, and it was reported that more than 100 bags of Jiangbei wheat were traded outside the market, and the price was 6.8 yuan. This batch is not regarded as a formal market.</p>
<p>Australian Wheat Continued to Arrive</p>
<p>More than 15,000 Tons - Will Be Imported Tomorrow and the Day After</p>
<p>Recently, foreign wheat has been continuously shipped to Shen. Last month, the German wheel Jantze Fritzen loaded 8,893 tons of wheat from Australia to Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 19th of last month, but unexpectedly, not only did the ship not enter the port at that time, but the news was also checked. The local agent of the wheel, Yitai Ship's head office, took the call to inquire, and there was no reply. The matter was bizarre. Then, on the 2nd of the previous day, he suddenly received a call from the wheel saying that he was going to Yokohama to load coal and would arrive in Shanghai tomorrow and the day after. In addition, the British company Trewellard also loaded more than 7,000 tons of wheat from Australia to Shanghai, and it is expected to be imported tomorrow. (Grandfather)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains - Yellow Beans Turn Up</p>
<p>Yesterday's yellow bean market conditions, in the rising price in production, turned to masonry. Dalian beans resurfaced at 8 yuan, and the base price was loosened after the devaluation. In addition, the Lian Dian continued to report the news of rising prices, and the market atmosphere suddenly became tense. As a result, two cars were opened at a price of 8.1 yuan. Japanese businessmen saw an opportunity to take advantage of the situation to open up. Ordered six cars to be delivered within the first period of March at a price of 7.96 yuan. The transaction of oil mills in Bengbu beans was opened, and the production price was reported to be high. Because the market atmosphere is easy to turn, a total of seven troops were traded yesterday, and the price was 7.6 yuan and 7.55 yuan, all delivered to the factory. The Chongming Sand Yellow Sales Market also turned lively. The local Guangbang allocated 1,300-400 bags, and the market price was raised by more than a jiao.</p>
<p>On the 28th, 150 tons of beans were shipped to Malta, and 27 tons were shipped to Columbus.</p>
<p>Sugar Market - Foreign Sugar Continued to Loose 5 Points</p>
<p>The trend of the sugar market is soft. The association divides the disk. The price of the original goods in the 24 He rough white station is 5 cents, and the price is 24.5 yuan. The price of transit goods is 16.2 jiao, which has not been achieved. The price of Taikoo Che White B mark goods in the original station is also 5 cents, 24.4 yuan, and there have been transactions. The price of Dongzhan goods is 24.3 yuan. The transaction of domestic sugar is still rare. The Chao Bang opened hundreds of bags of Shangbing White, and the price was 23.6-4 jiao. The price of Shangzhongdang Mianchi was slightly reduced, and 270 bags were opened at a price of 15.3-4 jiao. Guangbang opened 170 pieces of Beihai Pianqing, 12.5 yuan.</p>
<p>North-South Goods - Raw Peanuts and Raw Fruits are Expensive</p>
<p>Qingdao Newsletter, the raw peanut stock is not high. The current stock of Chajie is 70,000 bags, and the export team is 70,000 bags, so the market is very tight. It has risen to a height of about 10,000 since the beginning of the month. The red disk large kernel is opened at 11.9 yuan, and the ordinary is 11 yuan. It has now risen by 4 jiao to 12.3 yuan to 11.4 yuan. Only 10,000 bags of raw fruits are left. At the beginning, the price of Wangtai raw fruits was 9 yuan, and the price of Gaomi fruits was 9.2 jiao. It has now risen by 2-3 jiao, Wangtai fruit is 9.2 jiao, and Gaomi fruit is 9.4-5 jiao.</p>
<p>Seafood - Dried Octopus and Jellyfish Head - Market Conditions are Tight</p>
<p>The red disk of Dried Octopus is tighter. Shantou and other gangs have asked. Therefore, the new goods have risen to 38 yuan, and the old goods are 35 yuan. Jellyfish head and jellyfish skin are also very lively. The new jellyfish head is 11 yuan, the old goods are 16 yuan, the new jellyfish skin is 13 yuan, and the old goods are 18 yuan.</p>
<p>Coal - Indian Coal Increased by Two Yuan</p>
<p>Indian Coking Coal, recently the foreign exchange has been tight, and the production price has turned up. There is no follow-up to the source of high-quality goods. The number disk is strong to hold high prices. The previous day, a colleague traded 200 tons from a certain number, and the price of the stack list was dismantled. The calculated price of Kharkarta block was 42 yuan per ton, No. 2 was 40 yuan, the incoming coal chips was 41 yuan, and the block coal screen was 40 yuan. The average price has risen by two yuan compared with the red disk in the previous month, so the door and shop also raised the selling price to maintain the cost.</p>
<p>American Coal is Shipped to Shanghai from Thousands of Miles Away - A Proof of the Lack of Coal in Shanghai</p>
<p>American Coal has come to Shanghai again. It is reported that the Dulveen loaded 7,750 tons of coal from New York, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon.</p>
<p>Letter - Another Question About Small Flour Mills</p>
<p>I recently received a letter from Zhang Chengjun (the address is Jianshi Lane 120, Tongfu Road 315) and I want to try to run a small flour mill in my hometown of Haimen. I want to know the address of Zhu Dingzhi Jun for contact. Please check Zhu Jun's reply on February 12 for Zhu Jun's contact address. Editor</p>

<h3>Shanghai Educational Association, etc. – A Letter to Teachers, Staff, and Students Regarding Fundraising for Refugee Production and Education Expenses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Educational Association, the Shanghai Secondary School Advancement Association, the Secondary School Teachers and Staff Union, the Primary Education Advancement Association, the Continuing Education Association, etc., have repeatedly convened meetings and made every effort to promote the Refugee Production and Education Fund. Now, together with various associations, we respectfully inform all teachers, staff, and students in this city to actively participate. The letter to teachers, staff, and students is recorded below:</p>
<p>Dear teachers and staff, dear students, the national crisis has reached a severe stage. Aren't we very fortunate to still be able to live and teach in peace? Let us look at our compatriots in the refugee camps. Driven by a sense of national consciousness, they left their hometowns. Some were separated from their most beloved wives, daughters, grandchildren, nephews, and nieces; some were separated from their most beloved parents, siblings, brothers, and sisters; some lost their most precious fields and houses; some abandoned their most fulfilling families and schools. In bitter winds and pouring rain, exposed to frost and moonlight, they endured the most tragic and difficult circumstances, struggling to reach safety, uttering cries of hunger without food, cold without clothing, homelessness, and powerlessness. They received relief from benevolent gentlemen and government authorities and were settled in refugee camps. How admirable and tragic this is! Do we not have tears of sympathy?</p>
<p>However, this war of resistance is a long-term one, and it is definitely not something that can be ended in a short period of time. Sheltering refugees is a temporary and passive solution, not a proactive and sustainable one. Moreover, the refugees in the camps generally do not want to simply receive passive relief; they feel ashamed and uneasy. Now, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has raised the Refugee Production and Education Fund, implementing refugee production and education, and establishing refugee production enterprises, so that refugees can acquire productive knowledge and skills, engage in production, support themselves, and further increase production and build the national economy for the country and society. This is truly a sound approach that achieves multiple goals with one effort and provides lasting benefits. Out of sympathy for the refugees, we should also sympathize with the Refugee Relief Association's campaign to raise the Refugee Production and Education Fund and provide practical assistance.</p>
<p>Realizing this, the members of our associations want to concentrate the strength of our teachers, staff, and students in various schools to raise 100,000 yuan for the Refugee Production and Education Fund to express our young students' enthusiasm for helping refugee compatriots. Therefore, the members of our associations have several sincere requests, hoping that everyone will make an effort:</p>
<p>1. Teachers and staff of all schools should save money from the Lunar New Year holidays and generously donate to set an example for students in their schools.</p>
<p>2. Students of all schools should save personal expenses and persuade their parents, siblings, brothers, sisters, relatives, and friends to generously donate and enthusiastically contribute.</p>
<p>3. In the shortest possible time, preferably within a week, everyone should gather the funds donated by themselves and others to purchase Leshan badges.</p>
<p>Our city has 150,000 primary school students, 100,000 secondary school students, and 50,000 university students and students in continuing education schools. With so many people, isn't raising a 100,000 yuan fund something that can definitely be achieved? The members of our associations wish everyone success in their efforts and shout the following three slogans to encourage each other: (1) Raising the Refugee Production and Education Fund is a true expression of our care for our refugee compatriots. (2) Donating to the Refugee Production and Education Fund is a true expression of our love. (3) Collecting 100,000 yuan for the Refugee Education and Training Fund within a week is an expression of our spirit of great Chinese national endurance in Shanghai, which is tied to international concepts.</p>
<p>School News</p>
<p>Yutai Chinese Typing and Shorthand College, Museum Road, Industrial Building: The Yutai Chinese Typing and Shorthand College is sponsored by the Yutai Chinese Typewriter Manufacturing Factory. The Chinese typewriters manufactured by the factory are leaders in the current market of various Chinese typewriters, with excellent construction and arbitrary vertical and horizontal arrangements, so that all sectors unanimously praise them upon purchase. Recently, the factory, seeing that the supply of typing talent is insufficient to meet demand, has specially established a school for specialized training and added a shorthand course, hiring the famous Ma Shou Zhao Changchuan (inventor of Ma's Chinese Shorthand) to reside in the school and teach. The school is scheduled to open on March 6. Recently, enrollment applications have been quite enthusiastic.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Educational Circles – Opinions on Educational Reform – A Few Opinions on Post-War Secondary Education Reform (1) – Zhang Wenchang</h3>
<p>Secondary education is located in the middle of the educational system. Its target is the most lively and dynamic youth. Its function must take into account both general education and vocational education. Its mission must enable students to enter institutions of higher learning while also equipping them with normal and sound citizenship qualities, attitudes, concepts, and abilities. In this way, secondary schools become difficult to manage, and this is true in other countries, but even more so in China. Because education is the upper layer of the social structure, its foundation is the political, economic, and social conditions.</p>
<p>Since China adopted the Western school system (Qing Guangxu 28th year, Gregorian calendar 1902), nearly forty years have passed. The school system has been changed repeatedly, but little effect has been seen. Pessimists even believe that the country's poverty and the people's hardship are due to education, which only knows how to consume and does not engage in production, and only seeks superficiality and does not value practicality. Although this criticism contains a portion of the truth, it is not entirely true. There is no country in the world where politics and economics are not on track, and education can be done well on its own. Therefore, education is closely related to society. To discuss how to reform education, we must first look at the trends of society. Secondary education is a link in the entire education system, and of course, it cannot be outside of this.</p>
<p>What will China's situation be like after the war? We might as well predict it. First, China's sacred war of resistance will definitely achieve final victory. Second, China's politics will inevitably embark on a republican political system based on the Three Principles of the People. Third, China's economy will inevitably feel extremely difficult after the war, requiring international investment, government-controlled construction, and development, and therefore, a great need for talent in various aspects of construction. Fourth, China's education and culture will inevitably be more developed due to this war of resistance, and an educational system that adapts to its own needs will be established. Popular education and basic education (including primary education and secondary education) will inevitably be more widespread, and higher education will inevitably be more practical and in-depth. This is an inevitable trend. Because post-war secondary education will inevitably have the following trends: (1) The number of students will inevitably be greater; (2) The economics of general parents will inevitably be more difficult; (3) Vocational education will inevitably be more needed; (4) General education will inevitably seek more proficiency and increased efficiency; (5) Secondary schools will inevitably be more widespread in rural towns and small cities. Therefore, the following points should be noted for the reform of post-war secondary education:</p>
<p>First, because the number of students is greater, the original school buildings are not enough to accommodate them, and many of the existing school buildings have been destroyed. Post-war reconstruction, of course, requires general planning for the construction of school buildings in the future. In terms of quality, we only seek firmness and not magnificence. In terms of quantity, we should take into account the balance of classrooms, libraries, laboratories, and playgrounds, so that the capacity of the classrooms can accommodate the entire school's population, but the capacity of the libraries, laboratories, self-study rooms, and playgrounds can also accommodate the entire school's population. If so, then the Gary School System or Platoon System can be tried, so that one school can accommodate the students of one school, so that the number of students in classrooms is equal to the number of students in libraries, laboratories, self-study rooms, and playgrounds, so that classes, experiments, self-study, and exercise alternate, and every room and every field has no empty seats. Then it can accommodate twice the number of students. This is much better than the current half-day schools in Shanghai, where students are bored at home for half a day. Moreover, in this way, it is not just symbolic recognition and knowledge transmission, but also skill training and physical fitness training. There are classes and also guided self-study, which should be called complete education. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>West Qing Basketball Game Yesterday – Hualian Fought Hard to Defeat Guoguang – Shen Yugong's Issue Caused a Major Dispute – Other Taishan and Makin Won</h3>
<p>There were three West Qing basketball games last night. In the first game, Moore defeated Taishan with a score of 43 to 22. In the second game, Makin also defeated Tianxing with a score of 74 to 29. The final game was between Hualian and Guoguang. It was originally scheduled to start at 9:00 p.m., but due to the issue of Shen Yugong's appearance, it was delayed until 10:00 p.m. Last night, when the game between Hualian and Guoguang was about to begin, Tao Bolinji, the scorer for West Qing, informed Sun Huipu, the captain of the Hualian team, that Shen Yugong could not play. Hualian retorted that they had not received prior notice. The West Qing clerk then hastily produced a one-page notice and handed it to Hualian, but it did not have the signature of the person in charge, so Hualian believed that the notice was unreliable. As a result, Shen Yugong still responded with halberds. After this turn of events, it was delayed by an hour. As a result of the confrontation, Guoguang took the lead in the first half with a score of 26 to 24. Guoguang continued to lead in the second half. Finally, Xu Zhaoxiong of Hualian committed four fouls and was dismissed, with four players playing. However, they still won with a score of 59 to 55.</p>

<h3>Generalissimo Chiang's Diet</h3>
<p>— Shui Niao</p>
<p>A person who has regular eating and living habits can enhance their physique. Generalissimo Chiang has never indulged in reckless eating and drinking or lacked moderation because of his position of honor. He gets up at six o'clock every morning, and after doing a lot of self-cultivation work, he starts his breakfast at seven-thirty. The breakfast items are very simple, nothing more than porridge and some eggs and a few dishes of vegetables that Chinese people have always eaten. He does not like to take irritants such as coffee and tea, for fear of harming his body and heart. His lunch time is generally at half past twelve every day. In addition to his wife, Ms. Soong Mei-ling, accompanying him, there are also senior military and political personnel and diplomatic representatives accompanying him from time to time. His daily dishes are mostly Chinese food, and he uses no more than five or six dishes each time. He also eats Western food occasionally every week, but it is also very simple, no more than four to six courses, and they are mostly vegetarian. He takes dinner on average between half past seven and eight o'clock every night, and his dishes are similar to those at lunch. After each meal, fruits such as oranges are common side dishes, also because these fruits help digestion; for the same reason, he loves Chinese cabbage the most. However, he has never drunk any kind of alcohol, whether it is Chinese old wine or foreign wine, for more than ten years. It is said that even beverages such as wine were only drunk when he and Ms. Soong Mei-ling got married. As for smoking to pass the time after a meal, as is common among people, this is also something that Generalissimo Chiang does not do. In the precepts he wrote for the Lixing Society, he warned soldiers, "Don't smoke! Don't drink!" He also revealed in the New Life Movement he has been advocating in recent years that there is encouragement not to smoke and not to drink: And he himself can set an example everywhere, which can give us a model!</p>
<h3>Eating Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Doctor Zhang Wenhua</p>
<p>The rampant nature of stomach and intestinal diseases in China is really worse than tuberculosis. The saying that disease enters through the mouth is really accurate for stomach and intestinal diseases. It is of course known to everyone that food should be chosen that is easy to digest and does not harm the stomach. But how can it not harm the stomach? People have already avoided a lot of trouble by not being completely Westernized and liking to eat raw vegetables: You must know that the fertilizer for planting land cannot be popularized in China, and the feces containing most of the insect eggs are still used. Fortunately, the habit is to eat it cooked, but this still cannot sit back and relax. You also have to give up the habit of stimulants, such as pepper, chili, and sour vinegar. Eating less can indeed promote your appetite, but after eating for a long time, your risk is invisibly damaged, isn't it? After a long time, you feel that you must have it to eat, without it, you simply cannot swallow, in fact, your appetite is invisibly decreasing, on the contrary, your appetite is abnormally increasing, which shows that the secretion of gastric acid has increased due to your constant stimulation, although food is very easy to digest, (that is, the corrosive effect of hydrochloric acid,) and your gastric mucosa is also corroded to form ulcers; how terrible this is! Although there are effective methods of treatment, it has already had a great impact on your spirit! Speaking of the temperature of food, people have always known that raw and cold things should not be eaten, and too hot things are also inappropriate. Cold feet cause anemia of the gastric mucosa and reduce gastric acid secretion, so that food is not easy to digest, too hot? Can make the gastric mucosa hyperemia and increase secretion, as a result, it is the same misfortune as eating stimulants. The Chinese people like to "eat while it's hot," allowing things like pot rice soup to be fresh only when it's hot, which is simply a bad habit that has a great impact on personal health and the future of the country.

<h3>Huangqiao Sesame Cake, Which Became Famous Overnight</h3>
<p>— Shuxia</p>
<p>On Guofu Road in Nanjing, there is a Huangqiao Sesame Cake shop. The boss of this shop is a native of Huangqiao, Taixing. He used the "place name" of his hometown as the "name" of his shop, and the sesame cakes produced in his shop are also named "Huangqiao."</p>
<p>Huangqiao Sesame Cake is similar in form to ordinary "large cakes," but the content is different. It is as loose and crispy as "seashell cakes," and it also contains things. Therefore, every morning, he has servants buy a few to fill his hunger. Soon, the general civil servants of Guofu also followed suit and bought them, so Huangqiao sesame cakes replaced large cakes and fried dough sticks and filled the Guofu's office. In this way, it spread from ten to ten, and from ten to a hundred. There are red bean paste or pickled mustard tuber pork floss wrapped inside, so it tastes better than "seashell cakes," and the price is very cheap, only selling for three cents per piece. This shop is near my alma mater, so I am almost a regular customer there.</p>
<p>Later, I don't know how, this kind of Huangqiao sesame cake was eaten by our chief Chairman Lin, who praised this cheap and good Huangqiao sesame cake's free advertisement, and it spread throughout the city in a very short period of time, and everyone came to buy it. Therefore, the sales of Huangqiao sesame cakes greatly increased, and the boss also gradually became rich.</p>
<p>After this transformation, I don't know if this lucky one – the Huangqiao Sesame Cake shop – can still exist safely?</p>
<p>Gentlemen who eat tonics! Please think about the refugees outside the window!</p>
<h3>Food in Chengdu</h3>
<p>— Najue</p>
<p>Before the war, Chengdu was a very elegant, leisurely, and comfortable society, so in any street, you can always find one or two tea houses and restaurants, and it is "customers are always full, and tea is never empty in the cup."</p>
<p>According to the survey statistics in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, there were 82,177 households in Chengdu, with a total population of 438,995 people, and there were 6,552 food and beverage establishments in Chengdu. As for the street food vendors, they are not included in the statistics. If we make a ratio between the population and the number of food and beverage establishments, it is enough to prove the special development of the catering industry in Chengdu. Now that Chengdu has become an important town in the rear after the Chengdu Mouth, the population has surged to about 600,000, so the number of food and beverage establishments must be even more prosperous.</p>
<p>The signs of Chengdu's general tea houses and restaurants are also unique; even the smallest tea garden is called "Hunyuan." A very ordinary restaurant is shamelessly called "Weiyu." A small hotel is named "Temporary Living Maintenance Office," which is also a fact. The one selling bean milk is called "the one selling milk by the Wanli Bridge," and the small shop selling wine is called "the small tavern where you won't go home until you're drunk," which is so poetic.</p>
<p>"Guguyan" is the most famous restaurant in Chengdu; the owner, Huang Jinling, is a master of cooking. He used to be a prefect, but now he has retired from his career and opened a restaurant in Chengdu with his entire family. Old Huang is nearly 70 years old, as strong as a young man. Everything is done by himself, and his skills are outstanding, so the people of Chengdu regard hosting guests at Guguyan as elegant and generous. The prices there are naturally higher than the public, but business is booming, and reservations are full every day. The most surprising thing is that guests are not allowed to order dishes at will.</p>
<p>Old Huang has a collection of ten thousand volumes of books. When he puts down the spatula, he has a volume in his hand. Every year, he writes a pair of humorous spring couplets. Now, I will transcribe three links to show his humor, which is also a good story in the catering industry: (1) "It's a pity that I have been reading books for sixty years, and I am still a cook. It takes some effort to make the flavors of twenty-two provinces." (2) "Make some shark fin and bird's nest to welcome all the masters and madams. Drop a little leftover soup and rice to feed our adults and children." (3) "From the cook on the side of the pot, the town guard was promoted to the stewed general. This good title is definitely more magnanimous than theirs. With the blessing of Mr. Li Lao in the temple and the food Bodhisattva, this year's flower market should show a little magic power."</p>
<h3>Food for Canada's Quintuplets</h3>
<p>— (Shuzhai)</p>
<p>The birth of quintuplets in Canada is one of the most sensational events worldwide in recent years. Many merchandise businesses use their names as trademarks, film companies specifically record their daily lives, and newspapers and magazines around the world publish articles heavily promoting them. At the same time, people all over the world are concerned about their lives: clothing, food, shelter, and transportation.</p>
<p>Here, let me tell you some things about what they eat in a day. Also, mothers, please take note that if you want your children to be healthy, in addition to paying attention to the starch in their food, you should also eat more things containing minerals and vitamins. This is because the Canadian quintuplets are lively and healthy because they often eat foods that are rich in nutrients!</p>
<p>Below is their daily food chart:</p>
<p>6:30 AM! Four ounces of oranges and cod liver oil.</p>
<p>8:10 AM! One egg, a large slice of buttered bread, tapioca pancakes, and five ounces of milk.</p>
<p>4:00 PM! Two slices of buttered bread and oxygenated milk.</p>
<p>4:30 PM! Tomato juice mixed with cod liver oil.</p>
<p>6:00 PM! Oatmeal porridge, four to five ounces of milk, bread, and butter.</p>
<p>(In addition to regular milk, each child has a small amount of oxygenated milk before meals, totaling about twenty ounces.)</p>
<p>The above food chart was prescribed by Dr. Dafoe, who cares for them.</p>
<h3>A Week's Economical Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>During the Spring Festival, you ate a lot of rich fish and meat, and maybe you feel too greasy; so you really need something lighter to adjust. In Monday's menu, I have included two light dishes, one is shredded chicken mixed with water celery, and the other is clam crucian carp soup, which will be very appetizing. At the end of the year, chicken prices have soared. Each chicken weighing more than three catties costs about four yuan, which really makes people dare not move their index fingers. However, ancestor worship and entertaining relatives and friends still require it, so you have to reluctantly buy one or two. If you are thrifty, then there may be some leftover white chicken, which can be shredded and mixed with water celery. Water celery must be blanched in boiling water, and mixed with soy sauce, sesame oil or sesame paste, which is very palatable. If there is no chicken, then use leaner shredded meat as a substitute, and add some shredded egg skin, which is also acceptable. As for the price of clams, it is not expensive. Buy more than a dozen of them and stew them with crucian carp to increase its flavor.</p>
<p>Monday: Shredded Chicken with Water Celery, Clam Crucian Carp Soup, Vinegar Shredded Mustard Greens, Stir-fried Dwarf Cabbage</p>
<p>Tuesday: Curry Beef, Braised Bream, Shrimp Tofu, Stir-fried Water Chestnut Cabbage</p>
<p>Wednesday: Cauliflower Stir-fried with Sliced ​​Meat, Pickled Cabbage with Small Yellow Croaker, Bamboo Shoot and Vermicelli Soup, Raw Malabar Spinach</p>
<p>Thursday: Braised Lamb, Pan-fried Ribbonfish, Stir-fried Cabbage Heart, Braised Radish</p>
<p>Friday: Shepherd's Purse Stir-fried with Shredded Meat, Braised Prawn Slices, Shrimp Stir-fried with Gluten, Scallion Oil Shredded Radish</p>
<p>Saturday: Fried Tofu Stuffed with Meat, Braised Small Mandarin Fish, Pickled Cabbage Tofu, Pea Sprouts and Fried Bamboo Shoot Slices</p>
<p>Sunday: Lion's Head Meatballs, Fried Egg, Stir-fried Spinach, Soy Bean Sprouts</p>

<h3>Practice Non-Cooperation</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>Unless they are traitors, who would cooperate with the enemy?</p>
<p>After all, traitors are a very small minority, and the cooperation they engage in does not have any significant effect. This is something we can take comfort in from the beginning of the war of resistance to the present.</p>
<p>However, I now have a worry: among compatriots who are absolutely not traitors, some are unknowingly cooperating with the enemy, subtly increasing the enemy's power. I cannot but point out this trend and appeal to our compatriots to practice non-cooperation to prevent the possible adverse effects and any disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>The most common form of invisible cooperation is applying for passes from the enemy. What is this: we are walking on our own land, and we have to apply for passes from them! Of course, those who go to apply for passes are not unpatriotic, and there are their own unavoidable difficulties in applying for passes. But let's think about it: what is the difference between this and recognizing their sovereignty and becoming their obedient subjects? Over time, who can say that it will not be taken for granted, become a habit, and forget one's original identity? Who can say that they will not take this opportunity to become self-important and make further use of it? As for the various pains, mental and physical, suffered when applying for and using this pass, they are minor matters, but they are already enough to make people frown in distress.</p>
<p>In addition, in the occupied areas, according to various rumors, there are inevitably people who are not traitors but who petition the enemy to redress grievances and seek justice, or request certain conveniences that seem to be irrelevant to the overall situation. I believe that such actions are also cooperating with the enemy invisibly and helping to increase the enemy's power.</p>
<p>I believe that in the present situation, in any matter, public or private, we can only avoid the suspicion of cooperating with the enemy by not dealing with them. Even if it is absolutely necessary and there is no other way to think of it, there is a need to do it occasionally, we should also try our best to reduce the number of times. In any other matter, in short, do not deal with them, that is the right way. It is better to suffer losses from our own people and get angry with our own people than to receive preferential treatment from the enemy, especially since they will never treat us well!</p>
<p>Byron said in "The Giaour," "A tyrant is nothing, if of our own nation." I appeal to our compatriots to consider these words carefully!</p>
<h3>Old Baldy Ding Di</h3>
<p>The sound of gunfire surrounded us from all directions, closer, fiercer, and denser.</p>
<p>A stray bullet fell from the sky, hitting the edge of the large pond, covered in wet mud, without exploding: it rolled over and over, stirring up a cloud of mud.</p>
<p>With a face full of mud, Little Baldy ran home.</p>
<p>"War! War! The Japanese devils have reached the village!"</p>
<p>Immediately, the hand of terror gripped the hearts of all the people in Yifuzhen. The heart was weak, while terror was so great and so deep.</p>
<p>A few people who were used to being calm spoke up:</p>
<p>"Don't panic! The Japanese soldiers must be here to suppress the guerrillas. We ordinary people are safe."</p>
<p>"Hey! Don't talk nonsense!"</p>
<p>"Let's hide quickly! Hide! Those of you with young men and women, hide quickly!"</p>
<p>Where to hide? At this moment, beside the melon shed, under the embankment, behind the cow, in the haystack...</p>
<p>Old Baldy Wang was not hiding. The little baldies crawled into the haystack, poked their heads out, and waved to him, but he ignored them. He took out an early tobacco pipe, sat down, and leisurely smoked his pipe.</p>
<p>In the courtyard, it was quiet, without any human voice. Behind and in front of the house, there was a bamboo forest. Footsteps sounded on the distant ridges. Closer, closer, he raised his head, the bamboo leaves trembled, as if a gust of wind, rustling, rustling—was it people—were they people being chased?</p>
<p>Ah! A head of blood! People with injuries!</p>
<p>"You you you—"</p>
<p>"Old sir! Quick! Quick! Please let us hide! The Japanese soldiers are coming from behind!"</p>
<p>There were two people in total, both with injuries! Seeing the pistols on their bodies, Old Baldy knew they were guerrillas. He immediately agreed, "Okay, okay." As a result, the two wounded people were hidden in the haystack.</p>
<p>After the silence, the disturbance stirred, wriggling in Quanfuzhen.</p>
<p>The sound of horses' hooves, curses, whips, pleas, and weeping...</p>
<p>Search, search, house-to-house search, it was Old Baldy's turn. Old Baldy shook his head, pretending to be foolish.</p>
<p>"Those two guerrillas who came to your village, hand them over quickly! If you don't tell us, they will beat you to death!"</p>
<p>The "translator" told the old man. Old Baldy shook his head and said nothing.</p>
<p>A junior officer jumped down from his horse and forcefully knocked Old Baldy's bald head with the butt of his gun. Old Baldy's eyes widened; he could not bear it.</p>
<p>"Damn it, who has ever hit me? You son of a bitch! You're taking advantage of me! Let's fight!"</p>
<p>He returned a punch to the officer, breaking his glasses. The officer was furious and shouting. Old Baldy was immediately tied up, his hands tied behind him to a tree.</p>
<p>"This bastard must be hiding them. Just ask him and we'll find the guerrillas."</p>
<p>The officer nodded. Old Baldy's clothes were stripped off.</p>
<p>Whipping, whipping, the skin on his arms turned purple and swollen. Whipping, whipping, blood dripped down. Warm, bright red...</p>
<p>"Hand over the guerrillas and we'll spare your life."</p>
<p>Old Baldy gritted his teeth, prepared to endure all punishment.</p>
<p>A bayonet stabbed into his palm, so painful he could not bear it; he shed tears.</p>
<p>The blood on the ground turned purple, his hands were covered in blood. He remained stubborn.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't it be better to hand over those two people? Save yourself some suffering."</p>
<p>The "translator" advised him with compassion. But Old Baldy was not happy to hear it. He shook his swollen head, looked up proudly, opened his mouth, and smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>"What is this! Am I afraid? Humph! You can kill me, with knives, with guns, whatever. Want me to confess, dream on!"</p>
<p>At this moment, Little Baldy slipped out of the haystack and knelt in front of Old Baldy.</p>
<p>"Tell them! Just hand over the people... If you don't say it, your life... Wuwu... your life... Wuwuwu... Wua..."</p>
<p>Ah! The naked body, the mess of blood and flesh, the wounds from the whipping; that was his poor father! He cried, his heart ached. He wanted his father to confess, because only by confessing could he avoid punishment.</p>
<p>But Old Baldy would not listen to any of this, and kicked Little Baldy away.</p>
<p>"Be a good son and avenge me. Work hard and be a man! Your father is old, death is the time! Get back!"</p>
<p>This was Old Baldy's voice.</p>
<p>It was passing on,—the joy of victory dispelling the spasm of pain.</p>
<h3>"Peace-loving person"'s Outing</h3>
<h3>Mulan Joins the Army</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>—National Novel Notes</p>
<p>The story of Mulan, the earliest record of the battle of course is "Mulan Poem", see Yuefu Poems, Volume 25. Regarding the era of this poem, there were many disputes, ten years ago Xu Zhongshu and others had some lively discussions in the Oriental Magazine, and until the year before last, Qu Ying Sheng continued to study it. Xu Zhongshu determined that Mulan poem was a work between the early Tang and the flourishing Tang Dynasties, and Yao Darong believed that it should belong to the late Sui and early Tang Dynasties; these two theories are the same as the later novels.</p>
<p>Next is the continued poem by Wei Yuanfu of the Tang Dynasty, Yuefu Poems said: "Wei Yuanfu, Zhejiang West Road Inspector and Imperial Censor Zhongyong, continued to add it." There is a warning sentence: "Relatives hold wine to congratulate parents, and then they know that giving birth to daughters is the same as sons."</p>
<p>After this, there should be many poems about Mulan, but in terms of drama, it seems that it was not until the Ming Dynasty that Xu Wenchang wrote a kind of Zaju "Female Mulan", which was mostly based on the original poem, with very few imaginative elements.</p>
<p>It was not until the early Qing Dynasty that Chu Renhuo's "Sui Tang Romance" interspersed a section of Mulan, the fifty-sixth episode was "Mulan Filial Son on Behalf of Joining the Army", and the fifty-ninth episode was "The Wonderful Woman Fengge Zhane". Another sister, Hua Youlan, was added, and she fell in love with Luo Cheng. It was written quite beautifully, and it seemed more successful than Hua Mulan.</p>
<p>It was not until the nineteenth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty that Pinwentang published "The Biography of a Loyal, Filial, Brave and Heroic Woman" in four volumes and thirty-two episodes, which is what this article is about, "Mulan Joins the Army". "Mulan Joins the Army" is the book title changed by the workshop. This book is a mixture of vernacular and classical Chinese, and the story is purely fabricated. It calls Mulan Poem a work by Li Jing, and it also mixes a lot of Taoist immortals, which is extremely ridiculous. In the middle, it intersperses with the events of Han Qin Hu, Shi Jian De, Wei Chi Gong, Chu Suiliang, etc. during the Sui and Tang Dynasties. It was not until the eighth episode that Zhu Mulan was born. According to the original preface of Xiu Qingshi, it is based on "Later Tang Shu". I have not seen this book; but after checking the new and old Tang books, there is neither Mulan nor Zhu Mulan. It is mostly that the author fabricated the story at will, and then fabricated the book title to make himself important, right?</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, Liu Shenshu (author of History of Medieval Literature) made the Luantan "Mulan Joins the Army". Recently, "Idle Book" magazine has republished it once, adding a clown as Mulan's cousin, who is afraid of fighting, so Mulan steps forward willingly, deliberately using cowardice to set off bravery. The singing is very good; but it is too elegant, and it does not seem to be understood by ordinary people, and because of lack of experience, the sentences are mostly awkward and difficult to pronounce, which is not as good as the one performed by Mei Lanfang.</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang's "Mulan Joins the Army" is included in the 29th volume of Xikao. According to the catalog of the library of the Peking National Drama Society, page 22, this play was written by Qi Rushan. It is almost entirely based on the original Mulan Poem, and the lead-in and exit poems even cleverly quote the original sentence. For example, Mulan said: "Ten thousand miles to the war, the pass is like flying. The northern air invades the double temples, and the cold light shines on the iron clothes." Only three words were changed. He also said: "Return to see the Son of Heaven, the Son of Heaven sits in the Mingtang." Mulan's brother said: "Sharpen the knife Huo Huo to pigs and sheep." There are also many warning sentences, such as Mulan's mother preventing her husband Hua Hu from joining the army, Hua Hu said: "I want to be a soldier, it is everyone's duty. If everyone has a fear of death and only seeks comfort, and does not save the country, what is the use of this people to the country! Although I am old, I ask myself that I can still fight one battle, even if I die on the battlefield, I will leave a good example for the sons, what is there to fear?" Later, Mulan's mother stopped Mulan again, and Mulan also said: "I want to share the worries for the country, men and women are the same. If in a country, everything has to rely on men, wouldn't women be useless? Besides, according to history, in ancient and modern times, there were many women who led troops to kill thieves." Finally, she also said: "If a woman is willing to make up her mind, she is the same as a man."</p>
<p>Yes, women are the same as men. Recently, haven't there been women joining the army in Guangxi and Shaanxi? Writers such as Xie Bingying, Hu Lanqi, Hu Ping, Li Mingjian, etc., are they not also entering and leaving the battlefield and writing reportage literature?</p>
<h3>I Can't Help But Think</h3>
<p>— Leng Yan</p>
<p>Reading Mr. Lu Gong's great work "It's Best If You Don't Think" in the January 25th issue of this publication, although he said later: "Go forward, I advise you, there is a new world ahead," meaning that we should work hard to resist the war and not be attached to our hometown, it is very easy to cause misunderstandings, so I wrote another poem to supplement it.</p>
<p>You tell me it's best not to think,</p>
<p>This will only disappoint you.</p>
<p>Friend, beautiful hometown,</p>
<p>No matter what, I can't help but think.</p>
<p>Although it has been destroyed by the enemy and turned into a graveyard,</p>
<p>Needle awns knee-deep grow in the fields,</p>
<p>That old house of more than ten years,</p>
<p>Only a few pillars are left, tilting east and west,</p>
<p>However, I will never give it to the enemy to enjoy in vain.</p>
<p>Listen, the song of "Fight Back to Our Hometown,"</p>
<p>Sings loudly,</p>
<p>Everyone is of one mind and one heart,</p>
<p>Working hard to restore our hometown.</p>
<p>We want to make the Qingbai flag,</p>
<p>Fly freely in our hometown;</p>
<p>We want to bury the seeds of the new China,</p>
<p>To be developed and grow in our hometown;</p>
<p>We want to eliminate the stains left by the enemy,</p>
<p>Make our hometown bright again!</p>
<p>Friends, work hard,</p>
<p>Everyone's blood is surging,</p>
<p>We never want to willingly dream of being slaves without a country.</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>Seven. Change</p>
<p>It has always been said that "good times don't last," and everyone regards Heguo Town as a paradise, but they don't know that there is no paradise in the world, let alone in the period of full-scale war, everything is related to the war. It is undoubtedly impossible to get out of the situation and be carefree.</p>
<p>Heguo Town's position as a paradise has gradually been affected by external influences and can no longer be maintained. This external influence is not the Japanese army, but a bandit team. Originally, the troops led by Regiment Commander Ye were less than two battalions. Although the outposts were placed far away, they could not completely control all the villages and towns. Therefore, in places where he could not reach, bandits took the opportunity to rise up. These bandits also impersonated the names of some teams. The most powerful of these appeared in Shaoxi Town, southeast of Heguo Town. The leader was called Li Xiaomao. Everyone called him One-Eyed Li because he was blind in one eye.</p>
<p>One-Eyed Li was originally a salt smuggler. After becoming the leader of the second phase, he did all kinds of evil, extorting people everywhere, making the general honest people suffer and be miserable. On the one hand, he also secretly communicated with the enemy, setting up donation cards in his sphere of influence, collecting landing donations and transit taxes on various goods, and establishing a rental office, regardless of whether the tenants were able to pay, each stone of rent had to collect 1.3 yuan of mu donation. In addition, such as exclusively selling opium, morphine and other drugs, and sheltering tax-paying casinos, were even more important sources of income. However, although he was lawless, he did not dare to easily commit Heguo Town, because he knew that the regular guerrillas led by Regiment Commander Ye were very strong, far from being able to compete with him.</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Ye had also heard about the various misdeeds of One-Eyed Li from time to time. However, on the one hand, he held the principle of "Chinese people not fighting Chinese people," and on the other hand, he hoped that they could repent and reform. It was also a way to preserve the strength of the country. Thirdly, he was afraid that if he pushed them too hard, they would surrender to the enemy and become accomplices. Therefore, he always endured and did not send out troops. Helplessly, the people within the sphere of influence of One-Eyed Li were really unable to bear the pain, and they came to Regiment Commander Ye to complain one after another. The accusations came like snowflakes. Regiment Commander Ye could not sit idly by, so he convened an emergency military meeting in the township office to discuss how to deal with this group of lawless bandits.</p>
<p>Except for the two battalion commanders who were stationed outside and did not attend, everyone else was there. Regiment Commander Ye roughly reported the various crimes of One-Eyed Li at the meeting, and then began to solicit everyone's opinions. (22)</p>

<h3>On Laughter in Kunqu Opera (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Master Ma Hongxiangyuan</p>
<p>Laughter in Kunqu Opera varies according to the different plots. If the research is not good, or it is against the plot, even if there is good singing and acting, it will be buried. Its relationship with the art in the play is very great. one</p>
<p>Since the relationship between laughter and the plot is like this, practitioners must conduct in-depth research, and even need to have wisdom, add understanding and speculation. In terms of amateur circles, there are very few good laughter. Because they occasionally use skits for entertainment, they learn to laugh for no reason, similar to madness. So they all abandon and do not learn, and their skills are naturally not as good as the performers. The research method of laughter can be divided into three, which are divided into categories according to the plot. A few examples are listed below:</p>
<p>I. Classification</p>
<p>Happy Laughter Category: Smile, hearty laughter, crazy laughter, coy laughter</p>
<p>Non-Happy Laughter Category: Mocking laughter, angry laughter, miserable laughter, sick laughter, pretended laughter</p>
<p>(Smile) Such as Zhou Yu in the Hotel. . "I'm happy to have a place to stay today" (Student)</p>
<p>(Hearty laughter) Such as Zhou Yu said in the previous play when he said "Really, really".</p>
<p>(Crazy laughter) such as Xiaosheng when Emperor Ming appeared in the Xu Pavilion, and also when the Tian family in Shuocin heard Cangtou said "If you want to marry a wife, you must be as beautiful as the lady." (Dan) (Crazy laughter can also be said to be wanton laughter)</p>
<p>(Coy laughter) such as Hongniang making Zhang Sheng see Yingying in Jiaqi (post-dan), and also in Changting and Naoxue, there are many coy laughter of the post, which mostly describes the sensible little maid.</p>
<p>(Mocking laughter) such as King Yi laughing loudly when he saw the white wolf in the Chess Game (Net), probably mocking the state of Chu for using monkeys as prime ministers.</p>
<p>(Angry laughter) such as Cheng Chun said in Dache "What a Marquis of Ten Thousand Households!" (Student) (Miserable laughter and sick laughter) such as Cui Shi in the Dream, as for the laughter when approaching the court, it is already the accumulation of loss of hope and shame in the heart, which will become crazy, so it is sick laughter, which is different from ordinary laughter.</p>
<p>(Pretended laughter) Such as Wang Yun in the Little Banquet, when he heard Lu Bu change his name to Father-in-law, he laughed loudly, but it was actually a pretended laughter.</p>
<p>The above is divided into nine types, and it is inevitable that there will be omissions, but divided by Sheng Dan Jing and other colors, there are dozens of types, which may actually be applied.</p>
<p>2. Voice</p>
<p>All Sheng's smiles, if there is a sound, it is extremely low and slow, Dan is silent, ugly can be used at will, but it must be with a few glib taste.</p>
<p>(Hearty laughter) Sheng made "Hahahaha", the length ratio of each sound is 3:2:1. The ratio of each size is also the same, which is slightly similar in laughter, and must be light in releasing thin air.</p>
<h3>Chatting about Chen Yunshang</h3>
<p>— Nie Ge from Hong Kong</p>
<p>Southern actress Chen Yunshang was hired by Shanghai Xinhua Company to star in the costume film "Mulan Joins the Army", which aroused the attention of people in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Now let us introduce this lucky star to the readers, so that readers can have a clear impression and understanding of her.</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang rose to prominence in the South China film industry last year, but she has only been engaged in the film industry for two and a half years. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, she came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou and began to enter the film industry. The first person to recognize her was the red director Su Yi in Hong Kong. Su was preparing the film "New Youth" and lacked a female lead, so he boldly chose her to play the role. The female lead was "an innocent country girl", and she was successful in the film. Then, she starred in "The Twelve Hairpins of the Golden House" in two episodes and "Flowers Bloom Wealth" under the direction of Tang Xiaodan of Daguan Company (formerly a set designer of Shanghai Tianyi Company and now also a Hong Kong red director), so her reputation grew day by day. Last year, after starring in "Blood Splash Baoshan City" directed by Situ Huimin, she jumped to the position of first-class red star.</p>
<p>She is relatively close to Qu Ran, a director who is also very prominent in Hong Kong. Since she starred in "The World is for the Public" under the direction of Director Qu, the two have been inseparable. This can be said with a recent incident. After Chen went to Shanghai, her car is now driven by Mr. Qu every day. Newspapers have published many "glamorous news" about them in the past, but they neither recognize it nor admit it.</p>
<p>As the star's status rises, so does the frame. When Chen Yunshang was filming in various companies in Hong Kong, in addition to her mother accompanying her every step of the way, there were also two "nannies" following her to serve her, one carrying food, clothing, and cosmetics, and the other specializing in pouring tea and handing towels. Busy non-stop. When it was hot, they would fan her behind her back, so proud and pretentious that it made people feel that she was too contrived, although she was very polite to deal with ordinary people.</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang's real name is Chen Minqiang. In Guangzhou, she has already starred in "Crushing Gusu Terrace" and "Tang Palace Dream", two historical costume films, in which she played the Empress of Yue and "Yang Guifei".</p>
<p>Before filming in Guangzhou, she was a member of the Guangzhou Song and Dance Troupe, when she was only thirteen years old. She often performed on stage at the Sincere Amusement Park and the Daxin Amusement Park. Later, she joined the "Sushu" of an art research association, learning Peking and Cantonese opera, and laid the foundation for today's fame.</p>
<h3>Entertainment News</h3>

<h3>Prospects for Old Opera (4)</h3>
<p>— Yu Tang</p>
<p>Comparing old opera to an antique seems most appropriate. Ancient pottery, when first made, was originally everyday utensils such as bottles, bowls, and jars. After being buried for thousands of years, once unearthed and in the hands of modern people, some use it to recall the lives of ancient people; some study the quality of its material, color, and pattern; some dust it off morning and night, treating it like a precious jade; or send it to a museum for careful preservation. No one uses it as a container anymore. The situation of old opera is similar: initially, the plays were written and performed mostly with good intentions of promoting good and suppressing evil, and of cyclical karmic retribution, to influence the audience. Later, repeated performances and ever-changing actors led to varied effects. For example, actor A performs best, actor B is slightly worse, and actor C performs poorly. Or, one actor is a living Zhuge Liang, and another is a living Cao Cao or Zhang Fei. This situation escalated, causing the nature of old opera to naturally shift from an art of life to an art for art's sake, far removed from the original purpose of creating and performing plays. Today, those who sit solemnly in the audience, watching the play and shedding tears, are ridiculed as fools worrying about ancient people. On the contrary, those who focus on the actors' eyes and gestures, or close their eyes in concentration, distinguishing the sharp, round, yin, and yang sounds, and the ups and downs of the melodies, are considered true appreciators of old opera. From this evolution, we can see that old opera focuses on technique, while the plot and consciousness have retreated to an insignificant position. No matter how absurd the plot of a play is, as long as the actors perform and sing well, the play can be called a masterpiece and have a large audience. In the past, weren't there many neglected and unpopular plays that were made popular by Tan Xinpei and others? Similarly, a script with a very progressive consciousness will not have a good effect if performed by inferior actors, it can be asserted. For example, the play "A Remnant of the Late Ming Dynasty" has a good script, and Zhou Xinfang's performance is quite moving. His disciples' performances are slightly less effective. An inferior actor's performance is simply not worth watching, let alone discussing the effect. Mr. Tao Zaidong's discussion of the play "Catching and Releasing Cao" is that it is very inappropriate, with insightful opinions. However, the play "Catching and Releasing Cao" was made popular by Tan Xinpei, and his every note, word, gesture, and step have become the typical model for today's actors. If one learns to imitate it well, it is considered correct; if one does not, it is considered incorrect. Not only do the actors not dare to make changes lightly, but even amateur performers who consider themselves to be more knowledgeable than the actors are bound by the ropes of acting techniques and do not have the courage to revise it. Regarding this point, several examples can be cited: small plays like "Eighteen Twists," "Little Cowherd," and "Little Grave Visit" have no consciousness to speak of at all, and an inferior actor's performance makes people drowsy; but if performed by a skilled Hua Dan and clown, it can be watched endlessly.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes - The True and False Yang Xiaolou</h3>
<p>— Shiwuxuan</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang decided to go to Nantong for the second time, accompanied by Yang Xiaolou. At that time, the Nantong market was not as prosperous as when Lanfang first came to Nantong. However, Zhang Jian's treatment of Lanfang could be described as extremely generous. In the east garden of the Haonan Villa, there were several buildings called Huazhu Ping'an Hall, which were located near the Hao River and faced the museum, with elegant scenery. Zhang specially designated them as Lanfang's residence, while Xiaolou was accommodated in the house of the actor Zha. Xiaolou was unhappy with the different treatment. When performing at the Gengsu Theatre, the people of Nantong, eager to see Xiaolou's reputation, flocked to watch. However, Xiaolou was a northern Wusheng, and his style was different from that of the southern school. The people of Nantong did not initially recognize the beauty of the northern school. In addition, Xiaolou was unmotivated and unwilling to exert himself, resulting in a scattered and uninspired performance. As a result, the people of Nantong echoed each other, saying that it was a fake Yang Xiaolou. This was overheard by Zhang Jian, who said to Lanfang one day, "There is a sentence in the couplet I wrote for the Gengsu Theatre, 'What is true is still false, why must the false be untrue.' I never thought it would be a eulogy for Xiaolou today."</p>
<h3>Hardworking "Tianxin"</h3>
<p>— Xu Yanfang</p>
<p>Her debut work "Tianxin" will be performed soon</p>
<p>Tianxin, originally named Zhang Nanzi, worked for the Jiangning County Government in 1929, and for the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau and Public Security Bureau in 1930. Later, she married Mr. Ma Er (Feng Shuluan). When the war broke out, Feng suddenly betrayed the country. Tianxin, in great pain and hatred, eventually left him. She briefly joined the Great China Drama Troupe organized by Yun Ziqian, initially as a guest performer. Unexpectedly, she achieved great success in "Thunderstorm" (Tianxin played Fanyi), and then became a formal performer. Later, the entire Great China troupe went to the Green Isle, and Tianxin also became the lead actress, rivaling Fan Xuepeng for a time. Recently, in addition to acting, Tianxin has set aside all meaningless social engagements and immersed herself in writing scripts. Her debut work is named "Tianxin," and she is currently working on writing the dialogue. Because she has a solid foundation, success is expected. Soon, when "Tianxin" is performed on stage, it will definitely cause a sensation.</p>

<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Court and the Pear Garden of the Old Capital (27)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Eating from the opera profession is not an easy task, especially in the Pear Garden circles of the old capital. Since the establishment of the Jingzhong Temple, positions such as the temple chief and the president of the Pear Garden Guild had great authority in controlling all affairs within the guild. In the prosperous era of opera schools, all students who completed their studies and graduated were essentially granted a diploma. They could perform anywhere with great prestige. Therefore, actors who came from opera schools did not need to go through the ritual of apprenticeship.</p>
<p>If an outsider wanted to join the opera profession, it was an extremely difficult and exclusionary matter. It was difficult to break in easily. Even if you could scheme and ask someone to introduce you to someone and kowtow to them, you would be considered to have entered this threshold. But if your respected teacher did not have great fame or, despite having fame, was unwilling to help you, you would not be able to thrive in the opera troupe.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, when I was making recordings in Beiping, Mr. Woyun Jushi and Mr. Dong Junfeng introduced me to an amateur actor who sang Xiaohualian named Wang Huaifu. They praised his voice as excellent and his recitations as crisp. He could imitate the styles of Xiaolou, Huang San, Sun Juxian, Zhu Suyun, and others in the "Picking Up Gold" play so perfectly that the imitation was virtually indistinguishable from the original when recorded. When I discussed this with the engineers, I realized that their Western mindset was that they would not accept anyone without a reputation. As the end of the year approached, Wang also asked Mr. Rong Zhifeng to plead with me to help a poor friend, even if it meant recording two or three sides for 300 yuan. Later, I said to the foreigner, "I will advance this 100 yuan. If it cannot be sold after recording, I will compensate for the loss of the wax disc." After this discussion, Wang's "Picking Up Gold" was finally recorded on three sides. Unexpectedly, it sold very well. People bought three copies at a time, and these few sides were the most profitable at the end of the year. That was because the royalty fee was 33 yuan per side, which was far different from Dr. Mei's price of 1,500 yuan per side. At that time, I finally helped the frustrated Wang vent his frustration.</p>
