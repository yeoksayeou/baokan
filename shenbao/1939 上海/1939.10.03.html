<h3>社評　開發西南與資金內流</h3>
<p>中國自抗戰軍事發生後，沿海沿江各省備受蹂躪；津滬粵諸大商埠幾不復成爲國際貿易之總滙，而向稱經濟大動脈之揚子江亦已失去其調節吐納之功效。中國之經濟重心蓋已隨千數百萬之東南人民而俱西，「開發西南」「自力更生」之聲浪，遂遍遐邇。</p>
<p>所謂西南、蓋指川康滇黔湘桂六省區言，其面積達五百七十餘萬方里，原有人口的一萬三千萬，天然之富源豐盈異常面多未開發。外有山陵湖沼爲屏蔽，佔軍略攻守之勝；復與緬甸安南相接壤，得國際交通之便；趨西北則爲陝甯新甘諸省，允別有遼闊偉大之天地者也。抗戰方在中途，西南於人力物力爲無盡藏；制勝憑藉，實繫於此。顧各方面之論及西南者，多謂西南可資開發之條件齊備，獨憾資金不足。然試察之上海市塲，入超鉅大，投機盛行，此非游資充斥之徵歟？則所謂開發西南資金不足者，非中國缺資金，徒以資金不西南流耳。抑何爲而然？擁有資金者：無遠識，一也；無宏志，二也；忽視投機之危險性，誤以投機爲致富捷徑，三也；上海與西南夙多隔閡，對西南之認識不足、四也；生活之方式與習慣，使彼習於上海生活者，視西南爲畏途，五也。此五者，初不僅上海人士爲然；海外華僑，不乏豪富，其於宗邦雖極忠誠，然知通商口岸者多，知西南情形者少，然亦有如陳守明等之組織「華西墾殖實業公司」，胡文虎等之籌備「滇邊華僑實業模範區」其尚在計畫中者頗有所聞。相形之下，猶不如各國金業家之踴躍：本年四月間，英商麥加利銀行舉行年會、其主席力言投資於西南之重要；美商美孚、英商亞細亞兩大油公司、均在川滇設立分行；福特汽車公司及鄧祿普膠輪公司、亦謀在川滇黔設立分廠。凡此具體事實，其意義非僅以經商營業爲限，而允在於信任中國政府確有保障其投資安全之力量，與夫此一大片處女地確有光明燦爛之前途也。上海游資已趨入投機末途，允以套買外滙與囤購貨物爲然，直接足以使外滙黑市飛騰，間接足以使市民負担加重。此其事實，言之痛心；推原其故，實以民族意識不足與發財觀念相抗衡。夫見利忘義，在彼勵行經濟統制政策之國家猶所不免，顧以上海現象爲獨甚，斯吾人不能不針對上海而謀有以挽救之。挽救之道，非以見利忘義之誚讓所得爲功；抑亦不必以此道德觀念爲唯一之出發點；要知檢討利害，利義固相合一也。誠以上海未來之動態、非任何人所能把握；上海今日若此，往後豈必若此；今日容投機，今日投機或似機會獨多，然動態而有何急轉直下之劇變，則行見所有投機分子皆不免爲此一變動所犧牲。惜乎此輩求利心太切而眼光又太淺，見不及此耳。故吾人敢大聲疾呼以喚起上海投機分子之覺悟日：觀於投機活動之勃興，即足反證上海經濟前途之沒落！夫投機本爲賭博，有得必有失，而在此漲落倐忽之滙市中，其危險乃益甚。且更進而觀察上海正常的工商業之現實：物價暴漲，影響市民之購買力而减縮市塲之需要，一也；游資幾爲投機事業所獨佔，金融機關對於企業放款咸具戒心，，資金之周轉日難，二也；淪陷區物產運滬，以及區內之生產設備，悉在壟斷與操縱之下，居然有「借屍還魂」之觀，非上海正常之工商業者所能競爭，三也；內銷門戶因封鎖而關閉，四也。由此種種得見孤島內之「畸形景氣」日益消沉；而上海之游資，亦最有與投機市塲同歸於盡之可能。然則擁有資金者，何爲而執迷不悟，留達上海耶？恝然去上海而入西南，又豈僅民族意識所應爾。謂非打算利害，亦在所必然耶？況投資西南之門洞開、國民政府旣多所措施矣；若獎勵與保障民營工業·發展交通工具、援助工廠西遷，便利金融周轉·容納雜鈔·滙劃付現·現滙款免費·凡此種種。固無非爲有志於經營西南者計也。</p>

<h3>日機狂炸粵桂日記　粵南及柳州均慘遭荼毒　華空軍在柳州上空迎擊</h3>
<p>廣州通信、月來日機進襲粵桂各　鎮、紀不勝紀、災惰慘重、茲綜合各地嚴皆、分紀如下、</p>
<p>八月二十九日、日機二十一架、濫炸桂省南寗、武鴨、在武鴨投彈十七枚、中國衛文光戲院北門城腳等處均被落彈、戲院被燬、別福音堂一座亦燬去、並炸燬民房十餘間、傷男子一人、三塘馬路共落六彈、內存用溜彈一枚、無甚損失、衹有大牛車三輛爲日機聞機槍掃射、略損、同時四塘之新與街亦落彈十三枚、炸毀某梭禮堂一座、民房十餘間、死男女各一人、及小孩二旬、並傷男女九人、五塘馬路附近落三彈、毀郵車一輛、同日日機又飛防城白龍尾等地轟炸、除毀民房二間外並傷貧民二人、三十日凌晨、有第一第二兩批日機七架、侵入桂省、直　貴縣投弱轟炸、肆虐後絀海、第三批日機九架、飛抵橫縣時、分爲二批、一搮三加飛抵州肆虐、投弱後間爾出海、第四批日機九架、亦飛桂省爾寗投彈、嗣間三塘出海、第五批日機九架、轟炸龍州憑　兩琲、損失未詳、下午又有日機九架闖進遷江、兩度遑兇投彈、間時另有日機八架、來往於永淖·賓陽·都圩·上林·遷江·各地偵察、迨前批日機在遷江投彈後、該批八架亦尾隋飛返出海、</p>
<p>九月一日晨、日機九架、侵入　省之茂各縣城、投彈十五枚、死傷數人、其餘損失得倉、日機逞兇欲、再侵入　　甫空盤旋偵察、始向南逸去、同日上午、日機六架、侵入廉江縣城、獲飛宅、共毀民房六間、傷二人、另有日機十七架、侵入桂省、賓至柳州、逞兇投彈、另一批八架、則由　康向西北飛襲桂、竄至寶陽上空、兩度投彈、損失未詳、另有日機八架、侵入粵省化縣下甫空盤旋偵察看、投彈八枚、某中學禮堂及職業學校頭座均被炸燬、死傷七十餘人、爲化縣被空襲以來之空難慘劇、</p>

<p>四日上午六時、日機五架、由混潤洲島　　向北飛、經欽州小董、闖入桂省南寗甫空、旋向武鴨進襲、八時三分、侵入賓陽上空、投下炸弱多枚、經滬濤向南逸去、同日上午七時四十六分、日機六架飛抵桂省博白屬龍潭、侵入　林上空、投彈十餘枚、當卽爆炸、損燬民房九間、傷平民二名、日機並以機槍掃射千餘發、至下午二時八分、又在　林上空投下爆炸燃燒彈十餘枚、城內有三處起火、日機投彈後、又以槍掃射、移時西飛、二時十二分、在與業屬白龍投彈數枚、向南運去、同日上午十時許、日機十一架、抵貴縣上空投下炸彈數十枚、日機逞兇後、皀向南飛竄去、下午二時四十三分、日機二十五架、在粵省合浦上空發現、向　州進襲、華方英通空軍、在某地起機一隊、凌空待機應戰、三時二十七分、日機闖入柳州市空時、華機卽與日機發生空戰、激戰十餘分鐘、日機遂倉皇搜彈數十枚、卽急向原種逼去、四時二十二分、復經貴縣投下數彈、卽向南出海、此次日機襲柳、南北河一帶民房、起火焚燒多次、至夜始熄、查是日日機在寶陽鬰林貴縣柳州等地轟炸、共出動五十二架、可見其肆虐行爲、愈來愈兇矣、</p>
<h3>漳州米荒形勢嚴重　每斤售價一元五角　當局尙無救濟辦法</h3>
<p>漳州通信、漳州土地肥沃、物產豐富、五榖·水菓及其他農產品、每年運銷外埠者、達數百萬元、已往來講、每年運銷泉廈者、亦達數十萬元、廈島淪陷後、海運遭日艦封鎖、農村經濟、顯形枯渴、今夏、漳州一再遭受水災、尤以六月中旬早稻方在成熟時、遭受洪水淹浸數日、損失最大、早稻收成銳減、晚稻分秧後、復遭洪水一再淹浸、損失亦多、這么一來、一般老於也故的米商富農、知道了米價高漲的必然趨勢、便爭相大量購買囤積、一般走私奸商、因爲厚鼓米珠薪桂、利益濃厚、不顧國法民憤的加緊走私、源源運出鼓浪嶼、再加以鄰縣泉屬各地、米糧不能自給、軍糧民食、均須源源仰給於漳州、在這種情形之下、便釀成了百年來未有的米荒、造成產米區的民眾沒有米食的笑話、</p>
<p>已往、當早稻收成後的夏秋時節、漳州米價約兩斗一元、支年稍爲貴了一些、也不過注角多錢、就算付出年冬、米價高漲、也不過是一元左右、當時許多人已呌書蓋連天、可是、誰曉得今年七月、漳州的米價、竟突破百年來的記録、新米每斗售價至一元二角以上、爲空前未有的怪現象、而且最近還鬧著有錢買不到米的慘劇、許多貧民、爲著無處買米、斷炊數日者、還有幾個老頭子爲著買不到米而看自殺的、</p>
<p>地方當局、對於米荒、雖注意救濟、但始終找不到適當的處置方法、起初是在「平價委員會」下工夫、拼命把米價壓低、可是這辦法是法標的辦法、而且上了米商的當、爲了「平價會」把米價表面的壓平、大小的米鋪、都宣佈沒有米了、於是要買米的人、須得向米鋪老板說好話、而且要具結不洩露秘密、然移才能以「最高的」價錢、卽超過平價會的標準價一角錢或一個人解以上、買到一些米、只能買一些而已、大宗的米、便宜紛紛向四郊疏散囤積、以及源源偷運出口去、爲的是這么一來、米商們有更大的利益、他們自然是不管什麼糧食與民生的、</p>
<p>接著、米荒問題的嚴重已非平價會的力量所能收效、於是當局又組織「糧食調劑會」、決定實行糧良統制、可是、工作僅在表面用工夫、實際上所收的效果並不多、民眾沒有米吃、還是遍地皆是、米價已在統制之下、高漲到新米一元五角、舊米二元以上、這情況繼續下去、誰能說社會秩序不會受影響呢、</p>

<h3>各國師範教育趨勢（四）　英國行放任制度</h3>
<p>歐洲大陸諸國的師範教育、自始迄今、悉在國家主持原則之下、各遂行其師資統制政策、惟英吉利島國、似不顧及此種澎湃之潮流、仍保持其一貫的傳統自由精神、怒即一種放任制度、考英國的師資問題、嚴初有柏爾加斯德、提倡所謂教生制、亦可各之學長教員制、一八三五年有洛巴克者、提議仿效法國、設立病範學校、未獲議會通過、一八三九年的國立師範學校運動、亦有一度醞釀、因宗教育團體反對、致無結果、僅私人所創設之Batterseatraining　Collge實現、旋得政府津貼、迨一八五○年、私立師範校受政府津貼者、竟有十六所之多、其學校學生、欲爲生徒師教者、可由政府補助其學資、其種生徒教師制、本由荷蘭傳來、後與學長教師制、同存並舉、現在或仍留有遺跡、一八四八年私立的師範專門校、由政府補助其建築費外、又發繼持費、故事實上英國之師範教育的經費、已由政府負擔、美國自一九四九年佛蘭克林創立教員養成所於菲列得菲軍、是爲美國有師範學校之始、一八二三年、威　滿州有私立師範學校出現、囚彼時受　　士師範學校的影響顯大、法人庫爭的公眾教育情殂報千書、爲美人謂譯問世、該書內容、引述普魯士之公立學校情況頗詳、一經介紹、遂生動力、　　促進公眾教育的發展、於是美國師範教育的發展、於是美國師範教育之父卡特（James　Catter）亦在一八三八年、竭力向馬薩塞州立法部建議、通過設立師範學校案、翌年便實現其計劃於克勤星教、其後各州仿之、推行至連、故論美之師範教育、在形式上不盡同於英、但究其實質、則大體類似囚其學　之選擇、課程之編訂、悉聽學校當局之自由也、</p>
<p>英吉利英國對師範教育、一向是採取助長的態度、不僅於民間的教育員養成事業爲然、即於大學校或高等教育機關、附設的師範部、也同樣是獲發補助費、以資促進、一九○二起、準許較大學區之中等學校、亦得附設師範學校、由國庫負擔其建築費、於是有志於教員者、可就學於中等學樣、生徒教師制、遂逐漸消滅、現在英國小學教師的普通出身、在由中等學校轉進師務學校或大學師範部、蓋中等學校之入學年齡爲十二歲、尙在幼稚期間、不應其考慮前途、有所決定、到十六歲時、先應優待生之考試、合格者、行有免繳學費等厚遇、如有志於教員者、十七歲時、可經試騐入學師範學校或大學師範部惟其入學資格中、尤以健康證明書、身份證明書爲主體、亦有重視品貌與風度者、一九二八年後、師範學校脫離中央政府之監督、由地方教育課主辦、俱宗教團體及非宗教團體、亦得經營之、一九三一年、二年制的師範學樣、全國計有七十四所、其中由大學附設者一所、地方教育課設立者二十二所、屬於宗教團體者三十九所、屬於非宗教團體者十二所、後二者的建築費、由教育課補助、其維持費、由設立者自籌、至於大學師範部、在一九三○年與一九三一年之交、全國有廿一所、修業係爲三年、嗣囚學位準備與職務準備的煩重、延長一年、前三年使學生從事學位的準備、後一年方事職務的準備、</p>

<h3>金融　利空之說突濃　現金午後猛跌</h3>
<p>昨日本市現金烚赤暗市先漲後突猛跌、已退入四千一百元大關內蓋有利於中國金傳說、同時外滙止緊劇鬆故、晨以香港等客帮等錢兌業力進，漲勢更得外滙趨緊之助、曾升見四千一百五十元高價、繼在銀樓帮與金號雙重賣勢壓力下、漸告不支下午已盛傳過二次之傳說忽盛、攸關利於中國整個金融、致外滙突告猛鬆、證券帮（代客帮）現金銀樓帮爭先傾出、金號納量雖宏、錢兌業先售後購、仍難挽已疲頹勢、竟傾跌至四千〇三十五元最低價收市、軋跌六十五元、各方人心轉堅爲疲、全日交易由稀轉盛、上午五六百兩、下午一千二三百兩、首飾金軋小五元、退至四百十元、中英純金與關金等呆定如故、</p>
<p>烚赤跌六十五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因外滙帶軟、員勢堅硬、某錢兌業首喊買進、售者頗少、開市做高二十元、錢兌　進銀樓帮五十兩、價爲四千一百二十元、開後香港帮突又委託某銀樓與某金號及某錢兌業等四起收購、雖有某金號及銀樓帮互相供塞、但因外滙仍帶軟化、散戶亦吸收頗殷、續漲三十元、錢兌業進現金號二十兩、爲四千一百五十元、時另一錢兌業突起賣風、而香港帮辦胃吃足、遂不支回降、立小三十元、某銀號賣予金號二十兩、爲四千一百二十元、此後證劵帮忽來收買、爲狀高昂、不久盤高二十五元、錢兌業進某擔客十兩、爲四千一百四十五元、將近午刻、聞外滙稍形回硬、進者頓具戒心、某金號復來拋塞、一霎時撳小二十五元、某金號賣予銀樓帮三十兩、爲四千一百二十元作午收價、聞收後形勢更虛、四千一百十二元會有做開、午後初開尚穩、首由金號進錢兌業三十兩、爲四千一百二十元、開後因市上某種利空消息、謠傳頗濃、且同時外滙猛鬆人心傾疲、某錢兌業及某金號競相塞出、價立暴落七十五元、錢兌業互做二十兩、爲四千〇四十五元、時某銀樓復代香港帮吸收、某金號亦獲利復進、一度曾回高二十五元、某金號進錢兌業二十兩、爲四千〇七十元、入後證券帮多頭忽來斬結、且現金號亦賣意頗股、故價復告不支、竟又撳小三十五元、金號售予錢兌業十兩、爲四千〇三—五元、昨晚收價、結果比上週末猛跌六十五元、聞收後趨勢稍穩、金號互做三十兩、價爲四千〇四十五元、繼錢兌業兀做十兩、價爲四千〇五十元、全天一百十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高十元、收進須减小三十餘元、現標金照掛脾金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>首飾金掛小五元</p>
<p>銀樓首饰金、每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百十五兀、迨至十時〇七分、掛高五元、正午回落五元、下午二時半掛小五元、此後無變化、結果計大同行改懸四百十元、新同行與上價相同、收進均須减低二十元光景、</p>
<p>外幣一片跌價聲</p>
<p>咋日外幣始堅而後疲、美金票初做十四元另六分、繼而步退入十四元關，午後匯市驟鬆、金價急轉直下、於是賣氣大盛、美金票降至十三元七角、比上週六計小二角三分、英金票跌七角、英金鎊低二元五角、美金鎊落二元、香港票及坎拿大票菲列濱票等各小一角、新加坡，票荷蘭票各跌二角、安南票羅比票各小五分、日金票微小一厘、朝鮮票則仍站一元一角七分二厘之間、餘亦不動、</p>
<p>貼現回小</p>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、又告不支、蓋外滙鬆、現金跌、買戶旣稀、現鈔遂供通於求也、每千元上午仍盤於七十上半左右、下午步低至七十三元、終稍回上至七十五元、比上週六軋跌二元半、錢業公會拆息仍掛二角勿更云、</p>
<h3>外匯大為鬆動</h3>
<p>外匯兌業已回上至四元〇二分、與英對美規定價相同、故本市滙豐美匯掛牌遂放長一二五、計達六元二五、法呂兩匯、亦稍跟長、他如英匯等則均無變動、而內盤因美對英匯兌、週六電報所長無幾、致未蒙若何影響、中途情况上午略形軟化、而下午則反動猛鬆、蓋初以華行與洋行等扒結、兼華商亦收購現期美匯、故潛勢曾一度緊軟、英金最緊計四便士三七五、美匯銀行賣價亦討過七元三一二五、嗣因日行突來吐售、致形勢遂止緊稍回、午後市上某種利空消息、謠傳頗熾、且有利某行等外行寶意轉濃、雖日紗廠曾來扒吸、但頭寸終感供逾於求、故趨勢猛鬆、英金最硬曾喊過四便士五三一二五、美匯亦會呌過七元五九三七五、惟結果以四便士五一五六二五、及七元五六二二五收盤、較週六英鬆〇七八一二五、美硬一二五、至十月份期貨、鬆勢允甚、因在利空消息下、多方興趣轉淡、且九月底交割己過、故遂見軋攏、照晚收英金僅距離〇四六八七五、美匯祇相差一二五、的合月息（除佣）爲一分六厘弱、而實際上尚難獲得、全天交易尚旺、</p>
<p>美匯掛牌長一二五</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條及美銀價均無來電、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美·對法均平、對滬長一二五、美對英·對法均大二五、對滬未更、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四便士四三七五、美匯七元四三七五、較之上週六、均無榮辱、開後因華行及洋行等前來扒結、並華商亦吸收現期美匯、是以爲狀略帶軟化、計華行首先結進有利現貨英金四便士四〇六一五及三七五、繼之華商與洋行亦購結外行現貨美滙七元四〇六五及三七五、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉、英平美長一二五、及白銀平衡稅揭曉、則無更動、此後華商又扒進某行現貨美金（票）爲七元一二五、兼扒結大通十月份美匯七元一八七五、時現貨美匯七元三七五難結、銀行曾討七元三二五、旋以日行正金突來吐塞、故情况遂稍回平、計日行吐予有利某行等外行現貨央金四便士四〇六二五、及現貨美滙七元三七五、後銀行吃進價曾還四便士四二一八七五及七元四〇六二五、延至午後、銀行現貨賣價、英金四便士四〇六二五、美滙七元三七五、比晨開英微緊〇三一二五、美峪軟〇六二五、</p>
<p>外商銀行賣意殊濃</p>
<p>後市因某種利空消息頗熾、加之外行有利某行等賣意殊濃、故市勢大鬆、計有利英行賣予同行及日紗廠現貨英金四便士四三七五及半便士、並現貨美滙由七元四三七五、硬至五六二五、後最硬英金曾喊過四便士五三一二五、美匯亦呌過七元五九三七五、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四便士五一五六二五、美滙七元五六六二五、十月份英余四便士四六八七五、美匯七元四三七五、結果比週六現貨英鬆〇七八一二五、美硬一二五、十月份英長一八七五、美賤三一二五、</p>
<p>九月份存息　銀錢業一律開六元</p>
<p>九月份滙劃存款拆息、昨銀行準備會通函各行、訂定爲每千元六元、（即月息六厘）、而錢業公會、昨亦經常會公決爲六元、故兩者己趨一致云、</p>
<h3>證券　公債趁低　不乏買進</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況、人心仍極紊亂、多方有力份子、尚可維持不動、惟一部份則在緩緩出籠、市氣因之不振、但市價雖見略小、而吃進者亦不乏人、昨日形勢、買進者散而多、賣出者少而衆、大通大豐潤利均有多四出籠或拋售、行市午前疲落數角、午後稍堅、結果漲落二角至四角半、成交總數約五十餘萬元、茲列簡表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交南洋兄弟煙草公司股五十股、價為八元四角五分、</p>
<p>又衆業公所報告云、昨日股市、趨勢極堅、較有名望各股、無不交易隆盛、且幾乎俱在全日最高價下收盤、中國營業公司股成交價四角、設以同比例作準計算、其債券變換新股時價値、當係一百零五兩、而今後者並不隨漲、誠屬費解、電訊報告八月份橡皮統計數字如下、出產八萬五千噸、較七月份减少一萬一千噸、消費九萬四千九百噸、較七月份增多九千八百噸、世界存底爲三十七萬一千噸、較前月份减低二萬四千噸、概言之、統計地位、極端堅强、而猶在不斷進步中也、惟此地橡皮股則略異趣而被漠視、此蓋由於邇來一般人目光專注實業股方面所致、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗市重振　粗細各漲十廿元</h3>
<p>連日在謠言籠罩下之紗市、今則又屬子廠、人心重振、市態轉趨上升、客銷仍然平淡無勁、未免美中不足也、所以漲風尚屬和緩、惟十支粗紗、較爲穩固、此由於存貨枯涸、內地江浙一帶、手工織廠需要益殷、香港方面亦有納胃、於是市况較細紗爲挺秀多矣、目前紗市就實際交易上着想、因各方需要濡滯而平平、惟原料鬆落無望、做多者頗不乏人也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因和平預言、猶屬過早、人氣又佳、場內買勢稍盛、二十支雙馬棧單即漲十五六元、價爲七百四十五元、現貨價爲七百七十五元、中途再漲三四元、嗣以客銷不旺、微見回下、迨至收盤時仍平定、查半日成交統計一千二百六十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲十五元、雙地球漲十八元、天女漲二十元、十支粗紗亦漲一二十元不等、永安廠開出十支特金城二百六十包、價爲六百五十元、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<h3>來源維艱　棉價難鬆　同業買賣尙熱鬧</h3>
<p>現棉交易、尚稱不弱、但廠胃未健、惟同業買賣優勢、榮豐廠稍有採辦外、其他未曾舉動、故市面依然穩靜、各路來源殊覺艱難、售價不鬆、通花開價爲一百五十五元至六元、榮豐廠進通棉身骨方面、比較良好者、價爲一百六十元、碼頭上到通州白包花三百八十包、草包五百包、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、昨日又轉活躍、市上原棉存底日見枯乾、近日因粗紗需要激增、供織十支之印棉平果兒立跳二十餘元、日來因叫十二支原棉幾將斷絕、故四十二支棉紗昨日猛漲四五十元、然二十支至三十二支之原棉雖市上各廠存底尚足敷一二月之用、然此類原棉、各方需要最殷將來西印度及巴西棉之價格飛漲、實屬意中事也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉布、晨初殊為平靜、棉價無茜軒輊、後因盛傳英美拒絕、投機者乘機購買、價格因而上騰、同業交易亦轉形活躍、股票市况挺秀、影響棉市殊甚、結果收盤價格較之上日漲起十餘磅音不等、印度連同預測跌一羅比餘、</p>
<h3>糧食　客幣湧到　供過於求　粳米仍應和上落</h3>
<p>昨各路來貨、計車輪包子四千餘包、河下貨依然無到、是以初開、各尖市又趨平定、及後市因本街及鄉莊俱屬懈淡、各尖遂呈供過於求、獨粳米仍以奇貨可居、異常鞏固、若特常粳仍爲四十三四元、特錫粳四十二三元、中四十一元、蘇同崑粳四十一元至四十元、崑顓新粳三十七八元、楓涇百哥四十元至三十九元半、崑嘉等新羊尖特二十六元三角、决之二十五兀、特蘆尖二十六元半、决之二十五元半、川尖廿五元至甘四元、江北尖廿元七八角至廿二元五角、蕪湖尖廿三元二角至廿二元半、硬尖廿一元五角至廿一元、變元平平、三十四五元、總計成交五千六七百包、</p>
<p>另訊、昨各路到頭仍有四五千包、江北等來源已經通暢、且鄂省今年秋收豐稔、巳有整批糙米來申、市上人心隨多趨軟、雖內地帮與本街尚有應酬、而行情仍見步小半元許、新到之漢口糙米一千包、祇開十九元、南京糙亦祇十九元五六角、江北蕪湖機秈高貨亦祇廿三允許、中决則祇廿一二元、倘後首到源絡繹、則售價或能再度步低云、</p>
<h3>粉廠催提定貨　囤戶回出　日廠期粉轉賣亦般</h3>
<p>現粉廠盤、尙無變化、仍站七元大關、回籠貨亦元重大出入、惟因廠家嚴催提貨、及期滿後加增棧租問題、致一般浮囤續有吐出、價爲六元九角至九角半、市面尚可站立、至日廠期粉、在市拋戶甚衆、此皆因和平空氣、致業外囤戶、紛紛求脫、十月份價祇六元八角半至八角、比上週末猛跌二三角、二日有粉二萬包、三日七千三百包、均運天津、</p>
<p>小麥來源、尚不湧旺、兩天中到貨、約計二萬餘包、，因近來謠言甚多、貨方心思不一、而各廠進胃觀望、囤戶均擬擇巧而取、市面頗感寂寞、統市廠辦暫停、僅囤戶略辦滁州南京烏衣等處共四五車、價九元九角至六角半、市面與前週相仿、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布市價　低于廠盤</h3>
<p>國布昨粵帮及本街現銷續暢、棉紗回漲、現市均低於廠盤，人心穩固故各布開價、反跌爲漲、白貨粗布以十三磅。十叫磅最堅、怡和新裕等廠出品每疋均張二角半、怡和十一粗布亦漲五分至一角、細布中下檔漲一角至二角半、細斜紋漲二角半至五角、漂染布漲一角至二角五分、綫呢·嗶嘰·絨布漲一角半至四角半、本街成交細布·細斜·坯布·粗布四百餘件、漂染印花布絨布近萬疋、粵帮辦色布。色斜·綫呢·貢緞·色丁等貨一萬餘疋、浙閩帮辦色布·色斜·印花絨·粗布·花色·等貨二百餘箱、昨日布疋運往天津、有二百零五件、</p>

<h3>油市　投機活動　豆油跌后劇漲</h3>
<p>咋日豆油市况、晨初尚承上週末之軟勢、開盤即跌去四角、後因人心受流言支配、本街辦胃發動、致囤戶拉抬殷切、下午完全爲操縱者所左右、結果較開盤價轉漲二元外、統計做開大連油二十桶、（價詳市價欄）神戶油一百桶、烟歧油五十件、靑歧油一百件、膠州油一百件、天津桶油二十桶、靑島桶油三十九桶、查豆子今日有三百八十包運天津、</p>

<p>本埠絲市、輯里經外銷又呈活躍、達昌信孚共進二百十担、麒麟跑馬靑龍白馬等級走銷均暢絲價開出二千元、較上週又漲五十元、故白廠經賣買、亦將受其刺激、蓋輯里經因內地存絲無多、固屬事實、然白廠經之原料、迄今尚有大部擱置虹口、以及秋繭情况之欠佳、白廠本年產量與市銷、勢更見尖銳也、故預測本埠絲市，目前趨勢、仍將繼續保持高昂也　昨紐的無市、橫濱上落微小、現貨一六一〇元、計無上落、近期一五七六元、逮期一五三〇元、僅有五元左右之漲跌、故國外絲市、仍在平淡境中云、</p>

<p>新膠子行方自辦貨己有到申、昨市售每砠九十元、</p>
<p>新核桃近到十餘包、毫州桃開六十元、南桃五十元、茲値初見數少、故價格較爲高昂、</p>
<p>黑木耳近市稍緊、漢口什耳開過二百七十七元現鈔、普通川耳昨開二百八十五元、匯劃高貨未能遷就、仍需三百元之譜</p>
<p>新蘭竹咋有續到、惟爲數僅二百餘箱、市勢有續挺之象、</p>

<p>五金　安的目尼　六千元外</p>
<p>湖南純銻、（俗稱安的目尼）、最近因到貨不多、且本埠存底不豐、而實銷方面尙佳、故本街同業心思甚堅、開價頻高、一日間漲起八百元及一千元之多、查該貨在一月前喊價祇三千五百元左右、自歐戰發動後、開價更見日升、及至最近、已漲到六千元出零、</p>
<p>健康論壇</p>
<h3>兩性衛生　最健全的婚姻</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞大醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>受生殖力優勝所支配</p>
<p>人類進化的結果，婚姻史上己經轉換一個新奇的面目了。制度由一夫多妻，一妻多夫，演進至一夫一妻。結合方式。亦由掠奪，買賣，代辦而至契的，世界正向一個動蕩，騷亂的方向前進，一切婚姻，亦呈現徘徊，不安的象微。二十世紀的大時代，共他革命，或可說有成就，而婚姻前途，依舊是晦暗萬分！</p>
<p>這是什麼緣故呢？一言以蔽之，這完全由於人們不明瞭愛情最大主力——健康的重要性，德國生理學家司託脫傳士說：『健全的婚姻，全根據健全的精力所產生』。蓋結婚是在尋求愛慾的滿足，此愛慾又爲繫衍子嗣之媒介，這是無庸吾認的。</p>
<p>健全婚姻的六義，是在各人的身體心靈，都很完整地不斷地進展。不良婚姻的主角，便是包含一方心靈的破碎，身體羸弱的分子，就是健全婚姻的破壞者。優生學家認爲不良婚姻的造成，愛情不專實爲主要原因，無限制的求愛，最易傷害生理，如早婚，如多妻，如婚前自凟，如婚後縱慾，均使生殖之機能衰退，新陳代謝的機能遲鈍，腦與腎部遂失却繁榮的保障，百病叢生，早衰遺精，陰萎早洩，神經衰弱，腰酸背痛，健忘失眠，漸漸形成，此種人不是夭逝，定常年與藥石爲伍。豈不痛心！</p>
<p>在醫言醫，此種疾病的治療，唯有積極服用德國老牌睾丸精質製劑男用女用「補體康」，始有回春之望，但一面亦宜嚴守攝生，同時允宜避免誤購類似之偽藥，蓋市上雖有以同樣成分之製劑號召病家，然多數爲變相之春藥，或類似春藥之補劑，惟有「補體康」一藥，，爲眞正之她壯動物睾丸精質大補劑，並有補腦之燐質摻入，其女用爲純粹卵巢內分泌製劑，具有調經種子，治貧血早衰之功。</p>
<p>淋病春秋</p>
<h3>夫妻患淋病　宜雙雙醫治</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師</p>
<p>淋病的病苦，只有患之者方能知之，殊不能用筆墨以形容之也。惟是一般老淋病者，因其久治無功，對於一般藥物，不免失望，故每多放棄治療之希望，復因不堪長時間之禁慾，與妻子不免發生性的行爲，於是史因之而傳染妻子，故凡患有淋病者，其妻子如被傳染，則下部之白帶驟多，陰道糜爛，進而威脅其生殖機能，如患者尚未結婚者，最佳於未婚時根治之，否則雖丈夫已經治愈，而妻子仍然有毒，則丈夫淋病之愈，還等於不愈也。換言之如己結婚之男子治療淋病而迄全愈，往往與其染有淋毒之妻子同衾共枕後，難免不前功盡棄。重復傳染也。</p>
<p>現在關於淋病患者之急需作安全治療之問題，旣已明白解釋。而剩餘之問題，是在如何作有效之療法是也。關於此一問題，現巳有圓滿的解決把握。因在在以內服藥而言，已有德國彼德博士發明之淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，此藥乃根據最新之非特異性療法，採用蛋白體黃色素等混合製成。歷經各國花柳病院專家之試騐，結果凡服「克淋儂」，於數小時內，即發生抗淋噬菌作用，在初起淋病時即有消炎利尿鎭痛淸淋之效。慢性淋則深藏各處之淋菌，亦得根本肅淸之，因而个切變症，亦應手而效。至於不幸妻子亦患淋病者，亦可服用「克淋儂」，外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，允易奏功。</p>
<p>淋病座談</p>
<h3>應特別注意之點</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師撰</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>根治淋濁，應注意之點，厥爲病家擇醫求藥之是否精細謹愼，或草率從事，如共一犯淋毒，能治療得當，則所謂淋病頑固不能根除者，實是欺人之語，惟是如果不依據科學的方法治療，或不守攝生，往往眞成爲難治之病，是不可不特別注意之點也。祇以淋病患者，多在初决遭遇，叉多無醫學常識，所以常共十分痛苦時，不免濫服市上一般富有副作用之成藥，以求暫時之鎭痛，豈知此等鎭痛之成藥，大多舍有一種麻醉性之成分。讀者須知吾人之初染淋病，其痛苦之現象，乃一種生理上自然之反應，並非用麻醉之法可以奏功。而且麻醉之品，大多有减低病家原有之抵抗力，此其一也。又一爲病家受環境關係，對於平時工作，還是勉强支持，要知淋病之第一攝生條件，厥爲安靜，今乃反其道而行之，於病體豈無害乎？故余歷年來治愈之淋病之較他人爲迅速者，病家除聽余治療外，並受余指示之攝生方法也。至對於治療方法，在內服藥中，首推淋病聖劑「克淋儂」，因「克淋儂」之殺菌功效，能直達病灶，包圍淋菌而撲滅之。一方並用德國靜電療法，使淋菌之附線前後尿道者，亦得靜電而無立足之地，故在急性淋時，因此等療法殺菌力之周密，無法漏網，迅速治療，而慢性淋之用此法，允能根本解決，永不再發也，診時上午十時至下午六時每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角，並贈價値一元之「性病全書」一册</p>
<h3>平時少自凟　婚后多快樂</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>世界上每一個靑年，差不多都在羨慕着結婚，因爲結婚是快樂的；美麗的；甜蜜的，但是，親愛的讀者們？我要告訴你，事實上是沒有這樣的簡單，反正，有許多靑年，爲了結婚而感到煩惱，痛苦，甚至於自殺，這是什麼緣故呢，因爲結婚是有一定的保障的，就是健康的身體與充沛的精力，靑年若失却這兩重保障，縱使結婚成立，亦必破產無疑，因此之故，患有自凟癖的靑年，應從今日起力行戒絕，俾使婚後快樂多一份保障，但如有因自凟而患遺精，腦弱，失眠，健忘，以及一切神紅衰弱者，亦請從事治療，吾則態陷愈深，婚後每有早洩發現，故應從早治療爲要，關於最有效之療法，莫如進服「耐而斯遺精片」，該劑對於遺精有當夜止遺之功，而服後功效持久，永不復發，此外如有因自凟而斵傷者，應即服以德國睾丸精質製劑男用「補體康」以補虧損。</p>
<h3>怎樣治癆？</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>未成癆前之咳嗽，爲成之先兆。故咳嗽於吾人之肺臟健康上。有甚大之關係。故咳嗽之症，在確保肺病之避免，先有治愈之必要。不過咳嗽一症，並非一般人想像中所難治，在此醫藥昌明，肺結核菌已頻末日之今日，咳嗽巳確有可以迅捷獲愈之成功。不論流行性感胃之咳嗽及肺加答兒之咳嗽，均可服肺病聖藥「補肺拿爾」一藥，能於三小時內，鎮咳化痰，神騐無比，故功效在肺病藥中，堪稱首選也。</p>

<h3>英國駐長江艦隊　已決定撤退五艘　調遣應付他處軍事需要　湘江一帶駐艦照常巡弋</h3>
<p>路透社上海消息、英政府鑒於他處之軍事上緊急需要、已決定將駐於長江中之英砲艦十艘撤回五艘、如此處置、可使有訓練之將士多人、得在實際戰事上作更有益之服務、此項決定之成立、葘認在他處軍事需求、更爲重要時、長江現狀無需在上海漢口間留駐砲艦十艘也、</p>
<p>美聯社本埠二日訊、此間英國海軍當局今日宣布、「茲因他處軍事緊急需要、」英國停泊揚子江中砲艦十艘、撤退五艘、公告聲稱、「英國政府、茲因他處軍事緊急需要、已決定將停泊陽子江中砲艦十艘、撤退五艘、因是得將大部巳受訓練官兵、置之於現役較爲有用之處、政府所以作該項決定者、因政府覺他處軍事需要殷切時、揚子江滬漢間、實無停留砲艦十艘之必要也、」</p>
<p>湘江砲艦　照常駐防</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、英大使館今（二日）晨正式宣布、長江英江防砲艦中之五艘、行將撤回、俾官兵能往其他各地服現役、查此今僅指今在日方控制下的長江中之砲艦而言、在「自由的中國」之長江（或湘北及洞庭湖）中英江防砲艦、則不在此令範圍內、</p>
<p>英大使館　公告原文</p>
<p>英大使館宣布之公告、全文如下、「英政府觀於其他各地之急切軍事需要、決計自長江英砲艦十艘中撤回其五、此舉將使大批熟練官兵、能服更有功用之現役、英政府因認爲其他軍事需要更爲迫切時、則長江現狀無需在上海與漢口間保留砲艦十艘、故作此決定」</p>

<h3>自甬轉口來滬土產　請免結滙　甬商成立　駁運公司</h3>
<p>滬甬間航輸、自禮和洋行謀福輪首創乘在鎭海口外逗留、等待卸貨之間隙、返滬重載旅客赴鎭、因旅客在鎭起卸、可隨到隨駁、貨物則須依開抵决序輪流寄錨駁運也、惟不果實行、故目前旅客往來滬甬、極爲濡滯、</p>
<p>德增旅客</p>
<p>此次德平輪於三十日開鎮、搭載旅客即感非常擁擠、且有一部旅客不及購票擅自登輪、致後至之購票旅客反而被擯在岸、茲悉是輩旅客由中意公司設法、爲改換華輪洋行大浦輸船票、該輸已定四日開鎭、加入滬甬航綫、又禮和洋行海福輸、巳定三日上午四時開鎭、載客亦極擁塞、</p>
<p>限結外匯</p>
<p>寗波浙海關自奉財部今、自甬轉口來滬土產、不論何種貨品、自上月二十日起均須購結外匯、惟上月中旬裝德平謀福兩輪貨物、因遇風浪退關、該批貨物已在請求通融出口、又寗波各業、對土貨結匯事、正電請財部救濟、勿杜土產外銷之路、惟尚未得復、連日自甬運滬貨物、已形剷减、</p>
<p>駁運公司</p>
<p>寗波航業界鑒於滬甬航輪遂漸加多、駁運船隻有統盤調整之必要、特發起組織駁運公司、現已正式成立、本共五萬元、寗波商會主席周大烈、航商竺梅先等均參加、故內部組織極爲健全、駁船供應數量可望加多、於行旅自多裨益也、</p>
<h3>羲艦離滬歸國</h3>
<p>字林報云、義國巡洋艦柯里奧尼號、昨日（一日）午前起椗、離滬返國、</p>
<h3>波蘭親任代辦　來滬視事</h3>

<h3>京滬路兩次炸斷　均經日方證實　惟否認死傷人命</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、日軍發言人昨（一日）晚對於京滬鐵路新近肇事、發表日方官塲之說明、據稱、九月十二日晨九時四十分、鎭江東甫新豐與渣澤間一部份鐵路綫被炸斷、惟損壞甚微、鐵軌僅一面稍損、至十一時五十八分即告修復、開往南京之鐵路業務、並無阻礙、第二次肇事、發生於九月二十八日午後八時三十分、電雷一枚、在橫林與戚墅堰某鐵路橋附近爆炸、時有貨客混合車一列駛過、一部份車輛遂出軌、機頭與貨車四五節墜入河中、但無傷亡、鐵路之損毀者、巳於當日晚間修復、於修理期間、旅客步行過橋、換乘另一端之火車、故京滬間交通、並未阻斷、兩次肇事、皆無傷亡、</p>
<h3>滬西戒備加嚴　遷移之風益熾　工部局仍不斷進行交涉　偽市府昨竟迫收營業稅</h3>
<p>滬西越界築路問題、工部局雖已與日偽方面、進行交涉、覓取解決途徑、無如偽方以得日方之支持、侵權行動、日益擴大、雜牌隊伍、大施活動租界探捕旣不獲行施警權、而偽「財政局」復於昨日起自立稅則、開始征收營業稅、當地居民、已陷雙重壓迫下、進退兩難、故小康之家、遂以遷地爲良、因之搬塲之風甚熾、租界當局爲防止邊界發生騷擾起見、業調動萬國商團鐵甲車隊、全部出防、巡邏邊區矣、茲誌各項消息於後、</p>
<p>交涉依舊　在進行中</p>
<p>日大使館發言人、於昨日招待西報記者席上、曾洩露一消息、謂工部局總裁費利澊氏、與偽「市長」傳筱庵、對越界築路捐稅問題、現正進行交涉中、當時某記者會詢如居民對偽方征收捐稅行動、置之不理、日方將採何種行動、日大使館發言人表示、「現尚未考慮及此、」</p>
<p>滬西一帶　情形緊張</p>
<p>本埠兩租界當局、對於界內防務、最近又複加緊、萬國商團之鐵甲隊、幾全部出動、防範滬西邊境、警務處之紅色警備車、則輪流在界內各交通出入耍口、從事搜查行人與車輛、至昨日滬西越界築路區域、曹家渡一帶、時見印度馬巡、往來巡梭、兆豐公園前、仍駐有偽警、地豐路口、昨日偽警戒備情形、較以往爲嚴、在交义路口五人一排、共三排、分駐四點角、檢查往來行人車輛、白利南路一二一號與前日相同、無甚變化、仍由徒手偽警守崗、</p>
<p>偽方實行　徵營業稅</p>
<p>偽「財政局」自通告於十月一日實行征收越界築路區域內房捐及營業稅後、因居民商號之極力反對、故房捐昨日仍未開徵、而「財政局」所規定征收營業稅百分之十·廿·卅、亦因各商號之反對、遂改爲百分之一·二·三已於昨日開始征收、對一般日用商品、均抽百分之一或二、而奢侈品則抽百分之三、一般小本經營之商人、既無法反抗、莫不呌苦運天、</p>
<p>傳將強迫　防疫注射</p>
<p>偽「市政府」受某方嗾使實行飭派「警察大隊」偽警侵入越界築路地段、佔據各路崗位後、連日偽方復有武裝巡邏車巡弋各路、致西區形勢、顯呈緊張、同時偽「財政局」並定本月一日起、强徵冬季捐稅、因之一般居民、莫不感受重大威脅、詛昨日又傳日方在滬西區內俟强微房捐後、並擬仿照北河南路甲區辦法、强迫居民施行防疫注射、居民聞訊、更形不安、</p>
<p>多數居民　紛紛遷移</p>
<p>滬西愚園路各里弄、自被偽警侵入後、居民深感不安、還移者頗不乏人、自偽方通告強徵房捐、並傳將強迫防疫注射後、各居戶等愈形恐慌、故昨日起遷移之風、益見蔓延、</p>
<p>華人應付　最感痛苦</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、工部局某員、今（二日）晨對於工部局與滬西大道當局間最近發展趨勢、表示意見稱、茍非與該區種種爭端有關之當局能獲互相諒解、則各種事件、對於界外馬路居民、頗有超與複難之勢、公共租界與大道兩當局均將通知該區住房納稅、並非不可能這之事、事實上此乃現局之結果、界外馬咱區住戶今向工部局納稅者、近已接大道當局囑付稅捐之通知、此事須由談判而解決之、暫時並無可資採行之方法、大受最近發展之影響者、多屬華人、除非雙方獲得妥協、則此單華人鼗難於應付、該區外籍居民、巳向本國領署請援、</p>
<h3>地貨業對統制蔬菜　表示嚴正立塲　以減輕市民負担為原則　密切注意此舉今後發展</h3>
<p>日偽企圖統制兩租界蔬菜之計劃、不久或將付諸實施、茲從各方探得實情如决、</p>
<p>日方機關　支持此舉</p>
<p>日偽方面統制兩租界主要食料、爲其一貫之方針、鮮肉魚類固已處在「牲畜市塲」及「魚市塲」控制之下、蔬菜統制，本年春間、即已發動、嗣因地貨業及各方堅決反對、未見實行、八月中旬、浦東一再發生攔截菜販、將菜蔬運往虹口市塲之事、旋以與論抨擊及內部衝突而中止、今茲舊事重提、擇定新垃圾橋堍四行倉庫爲「蔬菜市塲」、以期實現統制、聞已獲得「興亞院」及日海軍方面之同意矣、</p>
<p>四行倉庫　大事修葺</p>
<p>據記者調查所知、四行倉庫內堆存貨物及一切物件、均巳逐步搬出、因該倉庫經過孤軍苦守血鬥、外牆彈痕纍纍，內部亦多破損、故擬大事修葺、以資應用、此項工程、不日即開始進行、並擬在倉庫右旁空地另建新屋、以補不足、又聞另在虹橋路或白利南路及十六舖，等處、將分設市塲、以便統制滬西及浦東等處蔬菜運銷、</p>
<p>滬地貨業　態度嚴正</p>
<p>據地貨業某君稱、租界蔬菜價格、巳使市民不勝負担、本業當抱定减輕市民負担、掃除菜販及客家損害爲宗旨、決以愼重及嚴正態度、縝密應付此未來之危機、一且統制實施、如地貨行家、不與之合作、則所謂蔬菜市場恐無法營業、故必須以市民之利益為前提、全力以赴、叉水某與地貨素連成一氣、設蔬菜被統制、當然亦包括水菓在內、</p>
<p>法捕房搜查　安樂宮飯店</p>
<p>昨晚九時許、法捕房飭派中西探捕至愛多亞路二洋涇橋安樂宮大旅社、大肆搜查、歷半小時之久、結果並無所獲、</p>

<h3>從「性靈」到「賊」（上）</h3>
<p>— 消人</p>
<p>有些車是細想不得的：一細想，往往會把你嚇一大跳。</p>
<p>這是誰都知道的，幾年前一部分的文士突然「覺悟！」了，破着嗓子呌起了「性靈」「性靈」「性靈」。跟着出現的是大批明末和淸初「抒寫性靈」的文集的翻印，而且爲了實現「性靈文學」底本色，書底形式也特別古得很，整理的手續也用不着：不要分段，也不要標點。</p>
<p>自然，「性靈文學」是好的，使人「發思古之幽情」也是好的。所翻印的那些文集，也的確有些是「抒寫性靈」的作品。那些作者，我們底文士說的實在並沒有錯，他們講「洒脫」，講「瀟灑」，甚至講「超然」。但他們所以那樣講，要翻出根來，却未免有點「煞風景」。他們有的是：看見明朝快要亡了，社會一天一天地不安寗起來，感到了自己地位的危險，又沒有辦法，所以只得來那麼一套，騙騙人也騙騙自己。他們又有的是：自己生活在淸朝底統治下面了，或者作官，或者不作官，但總之甚麽話也不敢說，所以也只得來那麽一套，騙騙人也騙騙自己。——這樣，便產生了「抒寫性靈」的作品。自然，有些作品也的確是不錯的，但那來源却是沒路走，甚至沒出息。在現在，我們底文士却偏要提倡那種文學，實在就不免要使人發生一種感想，便是：我們底文士不但是準備着要做明末和淸初那樣環境下面的作家，而且還是給所有能寫作的人敎法子，呌大家都知道到那一天怎樣去維持自己底文學地位。</p>
<p>但就是所有的「抒寫性靈」的作品，也並不完全像我們文士所說的那樣乾凈。有許多原來却實在不單是「抒寫性靈」，也還抒寫「憤懣」，只是那憤懣却早巳都被挖掉，所以我們看不見了。憤懣的被挖掉，有的自然是文字獄底「功績」，有的却是作者底後代爲了本身底安全和官運，偷偷地做出來的事。——這樣，便只剩下淸一色的「抒寫性靈的作品。我們底文士對於這些事實統統給他一個不理，只把剩下的可以爲後代保安全和官運的東西當作寶貝，這就又不能不使人覺得我們底文士對於時代實在是敏感得很，而那打算也是周到得再不能周到了。</p>
<p>除了談「性靈」以外，値得注意的是另外一類靑年文士的談歷史。</p>
<p>這一類靑年文士所談的歷史依然是明末和淸初的歷史。——這自然是對的，在目前誰也不能說是沒有意義。而且舊書攤上「痛史」和「明季稗史」一類的書也還很多，兼之幾年前已經有人整理過一部分了，目前只要抄一抄便是一篇文章，也是很方便的。不過，要容許我們認眞地檢查一下，却就又有一點毛病露出來了。靑年文士抄得似乎過分忠實，也一樣地把明末叛亂的農民呌作「賊」「賊」「賊，也一樣地把「降賊」的人看成罪孽深重，在叙述淸朝開始統制中國的史實裹面總附帶着這樣的筆法。這雖然在抄的工夫上是很可佩服，但終究不是正確的見解。同時這也就說明了我們靑年文士雖然是另外一類，可是實際上還是承繼着「性靈」派文士底文統的。</p>
<p>在淸初那些「隱逸底筆下，一賊」固然是可恨極了，但最早的明朝却就是利用那些「賊」底帮助纔起來的，起來了以後，又去剝削他們，呌他們沒有法子去做他們本來面目的農民，只有仍然去當「賊」。但這一來，朝廷上的大人物却想出更妙的辦法了，那便是：請淸兵入關。淸朝開國的皇帝有一個極狡猾的「文化政策」：只要你不駡「大淸」，說說淸兵對漢人的虐殺是可以的，因爲那能够顯顯「大淸」底威武。</p>
<h3>小唱</h3>
<p>— 徐野</p>
<p>桂子</p>
<p>從遼闊的晴空飄來一片梧桐葉，給旅人傳來音訊：江南正秋天。</p>
<p>明朗的天老是帶着一陣輕薄的灰色，驕陽只得在西南中走失了。由一株窗前的常綠樹望到整個的秋空，看着繞住於天邊一角的雲綵，像銀蛇，更像金織的蛟龍，迂迥着，飛舞着，雖然它璀燦的時光是短暫而不久的，然而，因此我就歌頌一回秋空的淳美。</p>
<p>昨夜，無言地一個人走在夜街，擠在滾滾的人潮中湧過來又湧過去，嘈鬧的車聲裹我不自主地行了兩個鐘頭，當跑過一家鮮花店門口的時候，純熟地在某種刺目的彩色下我楞住了。</p>
<p>「桂子叉開花呢！」</p>
<p>貪婪而愛戀地，我終於嘆起來。</p>
<p>讓花店的主人瞧着我，讓玻璃櫃上的花朶瞧着我，顯然的在啟示着：你應該走了，誰給你的留運呢？</p>
<p>夜風拂進衣襟，微頭着的肢體勾起我神經上的感覺，看花要回故鄉去，故鄉的今日就是桂子怒放於枝頭的時節。</p>
<p>生活曾經有過燦爛的春天，但，還有過瀟洒的秋天；秋來了，我願奔馳於廣垠的禾塲，靜聆動聽的村女底歌聲，是蘆笛，是銀鈴，九月的風息播一盪着撲鼻的稻香。我再願高臥一於江河之畔，看夜在桂子葉縫一裹撒下了睡眠，出現東方的月亮在安慰我，於是，藍色的夢幻中我興奮了。</p>
<p>「聽雁，賞月，看杜，綴成你一篇美麗的詩！」</p>
<p>美麗的詩如今怎樣呢？這個思念寄託於迢遙的天涯。流浪却是月月日日，却怕見今年的秋月和桂子。</p>
<p>桂子在烽火下依舊開滿家園的牆頭嗎？</p>
<p>這成爲疑問，我固執地倔强地執起筆，準備遙向故鄉的天野探問一年一度的桂子底消息。……</p>
<h3>平糶　（下）</h3>
<p>— 霂長</p>
<p>老周披着舊雨衣，胸前凉颼颼，他摸着額，有些兒發燒。但他漫不在乎地在揮着棒子</p>
<p>太陽却又從曇雲中透出，淡淡的光映着晶雨。人們感到有上異樣的光輝和希望。他們更饑餓地抬着頭。</p>
<p>小張像隻落湯雞在馬路上竄溜，一歇不停在維持秩序，他常用棒代替口；一會兒却在那裹尋來一枝長竹竿，這對於他便利了不少，要是有人躐等而進，他就來個姜太公釣魚。</p>
<p>「豬玀！」</p>
<p>老周踱過去，調到「後防」，對一長縮　子的「演講了：「…喂，幹嗎擠得緊？不用推，你們在八點鐘才得進會館！昨天鐵門給擠開了踏死了人，今天誰又要……他媽媽的，一他用棒裝樣。</p>
<p>一長串彷彿是斷了螯的蟹，休息在濕泥團裹，嘆着氣，他們齊抬頭向東：鐵門開不？他們不敢向上擠，後面却總推過來。有的把袋搓成一條繩，用力在揹頸，牙齒咬得響響地，他們靜默，靜默。幾個埋在牆角的婦人在破傘下哭了。</p>
<p>老周瞥見，痛快之至：你們可要吃白米飯呢！她報復地冷笑一聲，轉身過去，然而再也沒回過頭來。</p>
<p>他在水裹踱著，一邊喊：「哼，你們先得買米票，四角二升是黑的，一元五升是藍的……豬玀，性了沒？」</p>
<p>一長列又晃着：他們緊貼着袋，籃子：把手中法幣再端相一下，却發見給自己揉碎了，他們失聲地呌着；幾個慌的在摸索自己底衣袋，身子被擠云擠來……「哎唷，我四毛角票沒了！」</p>
<p>「呀喲……」</p>
<p>老周走近喊：「混蛋，你再檢，你底衣袋。」</p>
<p>幾個慌得手忙腳亂，再摸案一通，接着是哭聲。</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>「哎唷，一連串，一運串，性命交關！」老周回過頭：一部包車正從街角拉來，坐着一位胖得要命的少奶奶，望着這一羣糶平米的人，她對那車夫說，「喂，阿壽，你把車篷拉上，雨水不得了。」</p>
<p>那車夫放下車，忙着扯起油篷。</p>
<p>「阿壽，他們在雨頭裹這樣起勁，爲什麼不預先買些米放在家裹呢？一車篷裹驚異的聲音。</p>
<p>老周怪刺耳，他跑去干涉了：「喂，識相點，靠攔繩的左邊拉！」</p>
<p>包車夫白着服，橡膠鞋像水鼠的吱呀吱呀，拉起車子走了。</p>
<p>老周心頭點上火，怪難熬地。他歇斯的里的又跑到鐵門邊來，却見門邊一個光頭中年人正把袋子危危地高舉着。</p>
<p>「又要擠？」他棒晃着，朝前去扯光頭，那人回頭見是巡捕，便虛怯怯縮到人堆裹去；他又硬扯着衆人呌排齊了。</p>
<p>雨又停住，陽光淡淡地映在路上。</p>
<p>人眞太擠，見那光頭又扯着袋子，給擠了出來，他站在階沿上垂着頭不動，老周這回可怒了，又衝着：「滾過去！」他要用棒子打，但眼前晃了晃，心中怪空虛地就想嘔。他站定了看這憔悴的光頭什麼樣。</p>
<p>光顯呆了一會，却把袋子拋在地上；接着軟洋洋地撲的倒下。把臉孔緊緊貼着濕地，躺得蠻安靜的。</p>
<p>衆人又轟的一聲，一長串晃動着：老周忙着趕過去，他想：「才怪，這傢伙連麫也不曾啃飽嗎？還是發痧？要命的……」</p>
<p>他推開了幾個人，想把光頭抱起，却猛地頭上嗡的一聲，耳朶給壓得好痛，他伸手摸，才發覺誰拋來一隻籃子正打中他底頭，制帽也結打歪了。</p>
<p>「你才是『豬玀』！病人來羅米，擠也擠死，你還要扯，給你扯倒了！哼……」尖銳的咆哮發在那邊人堆裹，他聽聽怪熟的；望過去：這人正很得意的歪着頭——頭上晃着一頂黑漆破壳克帽在指手劃脚地。</p>
<p>他驚異得跳了起來：還不是阿毛這個小鬼！</p>
<p>他再搓搓眼，認定眞是他，就吼了一聲躥過去：這小鬼越發無法無天了，敢來打老子？用棒子把他壓成「麫餑，好，媽媽的……</p>
<p>走近來，這小鬼才見到是「他」，慌的丟了帽鑽進人堆裹</p>
<p>一長串又轟的一聲，像長蛇地游動起來。</p>

<h3>所期望於宋德珠　鎔四大名旦特長於一爐　保持武旦獨有的精湛藝術</h3>
<p>— 彤齊予亦</p>
<p>好幾年以前不佞還往在北平的時候，我的朋友顧慧因先生，曾作了一戲曲學校旦角論」長文，登在立言報的游藝版上，很引起當時讀者們的興趣。因爲那時戲校旦角最受歡迎的是坤角趙金蓉，宋德珠僅以武旦劇著名，而侯玉蘭纔剛進戲校，在戲單上還沒有露名呢！可是慧因先生的目光眞是不同凡眼，他在戲校旦角論中竟然指出趙金蓉和宋德珠所據有的多方面的優劣點。結論是宋德珠的希望最大，不但是武戲，就是將來兼演花衫等文戲，其成就也是會超過其他諸人而上之的。這一段評論的話，經過三五年的長時間，至今仍然很深刻的印在故都的老顧曲家的腦海裹。因爲：慧因先生的預言眞是太靈騐了，不但是今日宋趙的優劣比較，盡在他的預料之中，就是侯玉蘭的靑衣戲會唱紅起來，也離不掉他老先生的法眼啊！</p>
<p>不佞的眼光雖沒有慧因先生銳利，可是也認爲德珠之好，是有目共覩的。現在，德珠的穎光社已經在黃金大戲院公演數日了，大家認爲德珠唱唸的甜潤，表情的細膩，武工的結實，眞不愧爲四小名旦的翹楚。</p>
<p>其實，藝術是沒有止境的。後進的人，一方而固然要模倣前輩的優點，不使中國舊劇藝術的特長失傳，一方面也不妨別出新裁，自己開創出幾條新的途徑來。譬如，梅畹華程禦霜的新腔，就是脫胎於陳德霖王瑤卿的，可是老腔的運用就的確沒有新腔來得悅耳動聽。不過，新的創造是要有一定的範圍的，循規蹈矩的，並不是一味掛羊頭賣狗肉的胡鬧。程禦霜的程腔雖獨出心裁，却曾經過王瑤卿的指授，不離舊劇優美藝術的範圍。宋德珠的驚奇出手，雖然有多套是別人所不會的，却也經過九陣風朱玉康等的敎導。以德珠的武旦花衫工夫的精湛，從今日起保持着四小名旦的冠軍是不成問題的，我們更願意特別期望他：（一）鎔四大名旦的專長於一爐，兼擅各派的優點。（二）努力保持和發展武旦獨有的技藝，勿忮勿懈！關於前一點，近年德珠親承王瑤卿的敎益，並得到秘本的贈給，並由名編劇家吳幻蓀先生特編名劇，他可以說是已經一部分的做到融會衆長的地步了。所以，我寫出這兩點意見來，不但是供給評劇界的參考，就是喜歡德珠藝術的觀衆們，也不妨就這兩點來衡量他的藝術的眞價値。</p>
<h3>續雙十節頭輪片預報</h3>
<p>— 新力</p>
<p>閱昨日本刊亮君的「雙十節頭輪片預報」一文後，覺內容尚有一點錯誤，不得不加以改正，國片亦未論及，茲經筆者探誌於下。</p>
<p>國泰的雙十節片子，現巳決定，不楚「三壯士」，也不是「鐵馬」，（不過該二片於雙十後仍將在該院决第獻映。）乃爲桃樂姗拉摩主演的「簾外桃花」，而由賈克彭尼，愛德華亞諾等諸大明星通力合演。該片屬好萊塢型的喜劇，桃樂姗拉摩以前所中演各片，向以歌唱爲主，此次改變作風，聞有驚人演出。</p>
<p>順便在這裹說一句，大光明雙—節所映保羅茂尼，及蓓蒂黛維絲主演的「錦繡山河一，聞將加價。</p>
<p>至於在國片方面呢。新光映「王熙鳳大鬧寗國府」，該片係華新出品，全部古裝，塲面偉大，動用資本及技術人才較「武則天」又加一倍。攝製時因主角顧蘭君罹病二度停拍。導演爲岳楓，主演除顧蘭君外，尚有梅熹·李紅·陸露明·白虹等諸大明星。據影界中人所傳，聞顧蘭君或將於最近脫羅新華，而與袁美雲等自組公司</p>
<p>金城原定上演國華繼「新地獄」後之父一集體作「七重天」今因該片攝製不及，乃改映「小俠女」，按「小俠女」一片也爲國華出品，是小明星胡蓉蓉與龔秋霞繼「歌兄救母記」之後的又一傑作。</p>
<h3>慈善舞中之游藝</h3>
<p>— 籌成</p>
<p>上海難民救濟協會，於本月一日下午，假大都會舞廳舉行慈善伴舞競賽大會，敦請游藝界諸君，表演游藝，以助餘興。呂笑峯與兪祥明合演滑稽斬經堂，呂穿盔甲而着布鞋，腰問不佩寶劍向掛指揮刀，開塲謂渠之唱做，勝於麒麟童，有口皆碑，得力於老面皮，衆皆捧腹。兪着紅裙，而裸上身，兩隻假乳，行時簸動，令人肉麻。鄧國慶表演技術，運動自如，均係眞功夫，堪稱神乎其技。原定由張冶兒，江笑笑，何雙呆，裴揚華，陸希希，唐笑飛等二十人，聯合表演之摩登夫妻競賽，脚本業巳撰就？因皆出應堂會，故由張冶兒當衆聲明抱歉。並請筱快樂楊柳顿合演滑稽夫妻，居然二人穿了正式禮服，目有二童爲之拉紗，挽手入池，而由新娘唱戀愛曲，新郎報告戀愛經過，詳述一人由小菜塲內會晤後，約期吃小館子，住小客棧之歷史，並由包一飛與程笑飛二人，充來賓而演說，包操浦東白，程說無錫話，大老官與團團轉等土語，脫口而出，突梯滑稽，令人笑痛肚皮。入塲時，這一對滑稽夫妻，並向綽號好好先生之袁履登，拱手而喊老伯伯，座客咸軒渠不置</p>
<h3>縣令懲伶記</h3>
<p>— 詩味軒</p>
<p>前見申報舊報新抄裹登載楊月樓一案，我乃聯想起一件舊案來了。在遜淸光緒二十七八年，有一花旦名高彩雲，風頭之健，獨步申江，達官顯宦，都有交往，於是一班官家的姨太太，富豪的姬妾，甚至名門閨媛，大家想分嚐一臠，爭風吃醋，時有所聞。其中以一富商某之妻，往還尤密。某本懼內，初知之而莫可如何，一日某自外歸，見高與乃妻偎依私語，某情不自禁，面加呵斥，高不但不懼，反將桌上菜刀，肆意恫嚇，某一怒而出，竟控於上海縣署。時縣令爲海寗王欣甫，素有賢聲，當即簽提高伶到案，高有恃無恐，態度泰然，初審未有分曉，至翌日早堂提審，觀者如堵，皆欲一看賢令之如何懲此淫伶！方縣令升堂提問，忽皂隸呈上電報兩封，王令一笑，置之公案，不即啟閱，略詢口供，即判示責打五十板，枷示兩月，觀者莫不爭頌，及退至簽押房，方將電對拆閱，乃蘇州藩道爲高伶緩頰之電，王令笑謂左右曰：我若當堂一閱，則又爲淫伶所欺，五十大板打不成矣。當時雖大快人意，然不久王令撤職以去，聞與此案小無關係云。</p>
<h3>藝人動態</h3>
<p>— 慧存</p>
<p>馬彥祥前爲桂林國防藝術社聘任戲劇指導，近則自海防接其新夫人返渝，加入中國電影製片廠爲編導委員。</p>
<p>田漢現在桂林，隨帶湘劇戲班開演，頗受當地人士歡迎，不久將帶該戲班赴渝出演。</p>
<p>孫師毅現在桂林，不日赴渝。</p>
<p>曹禺現在昆明，担任西南聯合大學敎授。</p>
<p>趙慧深現在成都，爲西北影業公司客串主演一片，拍完後即將赴西北陳鯉庭處。共同參加戰區劇運工作。</p>
<p>程步高現在昆明，負有重大使命，不日將返海防任要職，有人向其問起電影界事，程頗不願重提往事，似對電影生活巳感厭倦。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>伶人與鴉片</p>
<p>還有逢到趕塲的時候，烟旣未抽足，又心中急躁，肝火往上一冲，再加以剛抽過烟後，嗓子發乾，如此一來，喉間準得鎖住發不出音來，這個樣子反倒格外的難過了。所以嗓子這樣東西，最是嬌嫩不過，平常固須加意愛護，而臨時尤須用之得當，能善用寶貴之「烟嗓」發出圓潤脆亮的聲音來，以取悅於觀衆，那纔不負觸犯國法身染惡嗜，以逐漸造成「烟嗓」之本指，倘若僅務虛表，以爲凡名角凡譚派鬚生均須先具癮君子之頭銜，彷彿非如此不足顯示其爲「譚派」也者，果如是，則其人固愚不可及，而其根本不能了解雅片與伶人喉嗓之利害關係，乃亦爲不可掩之事實也。</p>
<p>高慶奎在未塌中以前，嗓子極衝，誰知他在五年前戒烟之後，忽然會嗓音瘖啞，一字不出，那時不佞正在北平，有一天晚上在貫大元家裹，瞧見大元赤着膀子，在前胸上貼着一張膏藥，眼看着慢慢的鼓起一個泡來、於是郭仲衡的大爺（西醫）拿起一根針來，挿進這個泡裏，吸取這裏面的液體，然後再給他打在屁股上，當時慶奎聯奎昆仲站在一旁，一面極口稱讚這種戒烟法的神妙，一面拿言語安慰大元，他說：一昱明，你儘管放心好啦，這個法子是萬分安全的。我們哥兒倆，都是郭大爺用這偭方法戒絕的」。慶奎的琴師就是他老弟聯奎，弟兄倆在戒烟期間全都懶得要命，那時又沒組班演戲，當然嗓子可以不用吊啦。（一一一）</p>

<h3>Churchill Explains Britain and France's War Aims: To Ensure Hitler's Aggression is Taught a Lesson; Soviet Troops Enter Poland with the Aim of Defending Against German Power; British Army Deploys to the French Frontline, Not Ceasing Until Victory is Achieved</h3>
<p>London – Naval Minister Churchill delivered a broadcast address at 9:15 PM tonight, stating that since Britain and France declared war on Germany, only a month has passed, and while the war has not reached a critical stage, at least three major facts have emerged: (1) Germany and the Soviet Union, who previously partitioned Poland for 150 years, consistently failed to subdue the Polish people's spirit of independence. Now, these countries are said to be partitioning Poland again. Looking at the heroism of the soldiers and civilians of Warsaw in this resistance, it is clear that the Polish national spirit cannot be destroyed. It is like a rock at sea, sometimes submerged by huge waves, but it remains a rock and will eventually reappear above the sea. (2) The Soviet Union has extended its borders into Poland. Although we hope that the country will enter this new border line as a friendly nation of Poland or an ally of Poland, not as an aggressor, the deployment of the country's troops to this border is a necessary step to resist the German threat, which is also a real situation. In any case, this boundary now exists. In other words, the Eastern European front has now been established. Nationalist Germany does not dare to cross this line. The mission of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, who was recently summoned to Moscow, was none other than to listen to the Soviet Union's demands, that is, Germany must abandon its plans for the Balkan Peninsula and Ukraine, and Germany must accept these demands. I cannot speculate on how the Soviet Union will act in the future. The future is changing and enigmatic, but there is still a key, that is, the national interest of the Soviet Union. In short, allowing Germany to expand its power to the Black Sea coast, or allowing it to invade the Balkan countries and control the Southeastern European Slavs, is obviously inconsistent with the Soviet Union's national interests. However, regarding this, we can at least say that the interests of the Soviet Union and Britain and France are the same, because none of the three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union wants to see Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, or even Turkey under the German iron heel. Therefore, in this chaotic and uncertain situation, we can at least discern that the interests of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are completely consistent in preventing Germany from spreading the war to the Balkan countries. Based on this view, I firmly believe that Hitler cannot extend his power to Eastern and Southeastern Europe again, which is the second major event since the start of the war a month ago. (3) In the past month, our implementation of merchant ship inspection methods has been extremely effective. We have successively intercepted a large number of enemy food, kerosene, ore, and other goods, which is 150,000 tons more than the total amount of goods lost by our country's merchant ships after being sunk by enemy submarines. Our country's navy and air force have been searching for enemy submarines day and night, which is very effective. These submarines seem to have felt their precarious situation, so they would rather shift their targets and attack neutral countries' transport ships. It is hoped that the British Admiralty can one day invite transport ships from various countries to enjoy the benefits of escorting domestic merchant ships, which would be great. In short, the British government has now decided that no matter what happens, it will go to war with all its strength and will not stop until the final victory. A large number of our country's army troops have been sent to France to assist in the war. The British nation has decided to quickly join the excellent French army, but bear all the responsibilities. As for the government's previous statement that we have made sufficient preparations to deal with a three-year war, it does not mean that we cannot win in the short term. When we will win depends on how long Hitler and his corrupt and cruel bandits can enslave the German nation. Although the start of the war originated from Hitler's challenge, the end of the war cannot be decided by him. In other words, the outbreak of the war can be decided by him alone, but the end of the war must wait until we believe that he has received sufficient lessons before we can stop. Prime Minister Chamberlain has repeatedly clarified our war aims, saying, "The reason why Britain and France resolutely went to war is to remove the constant threat of aggression for European countries, so that all nations can maintain their independent sovereignty. We have now begun to act. It is our duty to defend civilization, and we will never look back until we achieve final success. Moreover, Britain and France, in terms of their population, have a total of 85 million people, who are united and determined to fulfill their obligations. In Germany, there are only 85 million people, and at least some of them are Austrians, Czechs, and Slovaks, who have not been conquered for long, and who still need to be suppressed by violence. In addition, we have an advantage in the ocean and can obtain a large amount of manpower and material resources from the territories of Britain and France. The citizens of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, totaling 20 million people, automatically support us. The people of India also support our actions in spirit and in heart. All countries in the world, especially the United States, have respect and sincerity for us. The neutrality of our great Italian ally is especially admired. In history, the most glorious war for mankind was the American Civil War eighty years ago. Both sides fought with great confidence. The war lasted a long time, and the war was extremely difficult. Although the Southern troops fought very bravely, they could not wash away the shame of advocating slavery. Today, although the Germans are said to be brave and good at fighting, the infamous name of Nazi brutality will eventually be washed away. This is the same as the fate of the Southern Army in the United States eighty years ago. The leader of the Liberal Party in our country's Victorian era, Blat, said that after the end of the American Civil War, the terrible black shadow (referring to the slavery system) that enveloped the entire American continent has disappeared forever with the war." How wonderful are these words! (Havas wire, 1st)</p>
<h3>Great Air Battle Between British and German Air Forces Over the Siegfried Line; Battle Lasts 35 Minutes; Three British Planes and Two German Planes Shot Down</h3>
<p>London – The Ministry of Aviation has just issued a communiqué stating that five of our reconnaissance planes engaged in combat with fifteen German Messerschmitt fighter planes over the Siegfried Line today. Although our pilots suffered losses, their combat skills have been demonstrated during this first time in battle. Previously, our military authorities ordered these reconnaissance planes to fly to the strongest fortifications in the Saar region to reconnoiter enemy positions. Although the enemy's anti-aircraft fire was extremely fierce along the border, our planes were still able to safely cross over and fly into enemy territory at an altitude of 20,000 feet. Soon after, nine enemy Messerschmitt fighter planes appeared in the clouds, 2,000 feet higher than our planes, and at the same time, six enemy planes flew from the right to attack. Although the disparity in numbers was great, our planes had to complete their reconnaissance mission and had no choice but to continue to advance in formation. In an instant, the air battle began. The enemy's tactics were to scatter and take turns firing densely at our planes, while their individual combat method was to quickly descend below our planes and then attack the abdomen from below. In total, the battle lasted 35 minutes. Three of our planes were shot down on the ground, and another was forced to land. Out of the twelve pilots, eight escaped by parachuting. The last plane, in addition to trying to complete its reconnaissance mission, also swept the enemy planes with machine guns from the plane, and finally hit two of them. They caught fire and crashed to the ground one after another. Our side spent only 259 bullets. The remaining thirteen German planes immediately stopped fighting and flew away. The last plane of our army also turned back, with the fuselage full of bullet holes, totaling eighty-nine. The gasoline tank was also pierced, and the pilot had to use a handkerchief to plug it and barely fly back to his country. When it landed, the fuselage tilted, touched the ground and caught fire. Fortunately, all the pilots were unharmed. (Havas wire, 1st)</p>
<h3>French Army Captures Important Area in the Saar River Delta; Controls Several Towns Such as Saarlautern; Some Artillery Battles on the East Bank of the Saar River</h3>
<p>Paris – According to French sources, the French army has made progress on the line southwest of Saarlautern (i.e., Saarlouis) by one and a half miles at the end of the week. It has captured an important area in the delta where the Nied River and the Saar River converge. The area is a plateau that can control several towns such as Saarlautern in the Saar basin. After the French army occupied this area, it can bombard the Bolinus River basin, which is an important transportation line to the front line on the right. According to the latest French communiqué, the war was quiet on Sunday, and there were artillery battles on both sides of the Saar River. (Reuters wire, 2nd)</p>
<p>Paris – The General Headquarters has just issued the 55th communiqué, which is brief, stating only that "Our two armies had artillery battles on the east bank of the Saar River today. Other than that, everything was calm on the entire line." (Havas wire, 1st)</p>
<p>Paris – The General Headquarters has just issued the 56th war report, stating, "Yesterday was relatively calm. Our army shot down several enemy planes in many places on the front line." (Havas wire, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Royal Decree: Youths Enlist; Ages 20 to 22</h3>
<p>London – The British King has issued a decree that all British men aged 20 to 22 residing in the United Kingdom on October 1 must enlist for service, with some exceptions. Those who are qualified to be called up must register at the local office of the Ministry of Labor on the date to be announced later. British citizens aged 20 to 22 residing outside the United Kingdom will be called up as soon as they return to the United Kingdom, and register at the local office of the Ministry of Labor within seven days of their return. It is expected that according to this order, the number of men aged 20 to 21 and men who reached the age of 10 on May 3 who are called up will be approximately 250,000. It is heard that no formal call-up notice will be issued to these men before November. In addition, 8,000 members of the militia will be transferred to the navy, and another 14,000 will be transferred to the air force. (Reuters wire, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Dykes in the Dutch Province of Polders Once Breached; Testing Existing Arrangements</h3>
<p>Amsterdam – According to sources familiar with the situation, the Netherlands breached the dykes of a portion of the small province of Polders just two weeks ago, allowing water to flow in, in order to test the existing arrangements and raise the water level to a certain height, so that it would be easier to continue to raise the water level when necessary. There are only 200 households in the area. In addition, no part of the Dutch defense system has been breached to allow flooding so far. It is also heard from those responsible that the authorities have not yet made a decision on continuing to allow the water to flow in. Some parties believe that the authorities will not take this action. Competent parties in The Hague have no knowledge of the German army concentrating on the border between the Netherlands and Germany. (Reuters wire, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Predictions for the Future of the European War; Time Favors Britain and France</h3>
<p>London – The war has entered its second month. Predictions from all sides about the possibilities for the future unanimously believe that time is actually in favor of the Allied countries. "Waiting for the opportunity" is the best strategy for the Allied countries, that is, to let the German army attack the Maginot Line to exhaust its strength, while the Allied countries intensify their economic blockade of Germany. Regarding this, a certain German official publication once published a warning from Colonel Hiss of the German Economic Bureau, saying that the railways in the Soviet Union, which is more than thirty times larger than France or Germany, have narrower tracks than France and Germany, and are even completely unsuitable for domestic needs, which will greatly hinder the economic assistance that the Soviet Union intends to provide to Germany. It is reported that Allied Commander-in-Chief General Gamelin has now allowed newspaper reporters to go to the front line, saying that "the time to lift the veil of silence has come," which shows that the commander-in-chief may have considered the Allied position to be quite satisfactory, and it is okay for newspaper reporters to take a look. The number of German planes appearing in the skies over the Western Front is increasing day by day, and their number is greater than that of the Allied planes, but the losses are at least evenly divided at present. British aviators often pretend to be shot down when they encounter overwhelming odds, and then fly straight after leaving the pursuit range, and often escape by this means. Aviation critics are now discussing the new problem of the height that new aircraft can reach. These aircraft can all safely ascend to an altitude of 20,000 feet above the ground, and many can reach 30,000 feet. Aviators may soon need to prepare not only oxygen, but also pressure chambers to resist air pressure. This is not impossible. The aerial battles in Albania, Spain, and China have not provided standards that can be followed in the current aerial battles, because the great powers participating in the current aerial battles have air forces with comparable offensive and defensive equipment.

<p>The Latvian capital's Foreign Minister Menders departed by plane this morning for Moscow. The Soviet Union's envoy to Latvia, Zotov, accompanied him. (Havas wire, 2nd)</p>
<p>The Latvian cabinet held a State Council meeting today, at which Foreign Minister Menders reported on the agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union and the mutual assistance agreement between the Soviet Union and Estonia. The cabinet immediately decided to send Foreign Minister Menders to Moscow tomorrow to hold talks with the Soviet government. (Havas wire, 1st)</p>
<p>Latvian capital – Regarding the fact that Latvian Foreign Minister Mendes' visit to Moscow is in line with the wishes of the Soviet government, it is difficult to know for sure at present, but what can be said with certainty is that the Soviet government seems to intend to sign the same agreement with Latvia as it did with the Soviet and Estonian states a few days ago. It is said that the Soviet government is now paying attention to obtaining the privilege of handling the Latvian port of Ribaya. According to this port, it belonged to Russia before the World War in 1914, and it was only after the war that it belonged to Latvia. People in political circles here claim that the government held a special meeting yesterday afternoon and decided to accept the Soviet request. (Haitong, 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin – The semi-official German News Agency has just received news from the Finnish capital stating that the evolution of the Baltic Sea situation is being closely watched by Finnish political circles. It is said that Latvia is about to be forced to sign a treaty with the Soviet Union, the nature of which is not much different from the mutual assistance treaty signed between the Soviet Union and Estonia. In other words, Latvia will allow the Soviet Union to use the ice-free ports of Riba and Wende, but not Riga. The port of Riba is not far from Germany's new border and can be reached by car in just one hour. (Havas wire, 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin – According to news from the Lithuanian capital, the country's ambassador to the Soviet Union, Battis, has returned home to report on his duties. This has nothing to do with the rumor that the Soviet Union has expressed to the country its desire to sign a friendship treaty, but not a mutual assistance agreement, so it is not the same as the agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Estonia. (Havas wire, 2nd)</p>
<p>Moscow – Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Molotov held a long talk with the Lithuanian envoy yesterday, and it is said that the content was to discuss the issue of Vilnius.

<h3>Italian Foreign Minister; Visits Germany and Returns Home</h3>
<p>Rome – Newspapers here reported a dispatch from Berlin stating that Hitler will deliver a speech to the House of Representatives on Wednesday, stating the German-Soviet solution regarding Poland and the "peace" proposals submitted to the Allied countries. These proposals include the establishment of a small buffer state between Germany and the Soviet Union. This new Poland will be entirely inhabited by Poles, with Warsaw as its capital. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Berlin this time was to clarify the new situation so that Italy's cooperation could be secured when this peace proposal was put forward. (Reuters wire, 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin – Italian Foreign Minister Ciano returned to his country by special train at noon today. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop personally went to the station to see him off. The official has just issued a communiqué stating, "Foreign Minister Ciano's trip was at the invitation of the German government." After listing the names of the dignitaries who were greeted at the station, it also said, "Foreign Minister Ciano and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop said goodbye in a very sincere manner."

<h3>Chamberlain Seems to Be Waiting; Postpones Declaration to Today</h3>
<p>London – At the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Labor Party leader Major Adly asked Prime Minister Chamberlain whether he could explain anything about the statement to be issued by Germany and the Soviet Union. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied that he did not intend to make any statement today, but would wait until tomorrow. (Havas wire, 2nd)</p>
<p>London – Several newspapers today commented on Hitler's "peace offensive." The Times stated that if the special peace conditions that Germany and the Soviet Union are prepared to put forward are not much different from those announced in Moscow on Friday, then the public's opposition to this barbaric declaration has predetermined our reply. Any conditions put forward by Hitler cannot change the main purpose of the Western European powers, that is, for the sake of ensuring future security, Hitler's power must be deprived so that he cannot repeat his crimes. The world knows that Hitler's credibility can no longer be trusted, so overthrowing Hitlerism should be a prerequisite for all negotiations. The Daily Telegraph said that this "peace proposal" must be attached with conditions that no country with the power of free choice can accept. Forcing countries that are still seeking to submit to consider peace proposals will inevitably fail. The Daily News also said that Hitler's request for peace is due to his weakness and inability to simultaneously enemy Britain and France. We must not allow the aggressor to keep his loot. There will be no peace until the people of Poland and Czechoslovakia are free from the tyranny of the National Socialist Party. The Daily Express stated that the peace conditions proposed by Hitler may not be acceptable to us, because democratic countries now know the value of what Hitler said. They have realized what Hitlerism is. There will be no room for negotiating peace with Germany when Czechoslovakia has not been freed from the shackles and Poland is bleeding. (Reuters wire, 2nd)</p>

Approximately, Hitler will say to the parliament that others have stated that the war objective is a way to deal with, approximately Hitler will say to the Parliament that others have stated that the war objective is to strike Hitlerism. Now I am prepared to step down and have created a great Germany. I hereby transfer the important task to Goring. Also, according to the Daily Chronicle, rumors about Hitler considering stepping down have been very prevalent in recent days. (Associated Press wire, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Editorial: Developing the Southwest and the Inflow of Capital</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of military resistance against Japan, the coastal and riverside provinces of China have suffered greatly. The major commercial ports such as Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou have almost ceased to be international trade hubs, and the Yangtze River, once known as the economic artery, has lost its function of regulation. China's economic center has moved west along with millions of people from the southeast. The voices of "developing the Southwest" and "self-reliance" have spread far and wide.</p>
<p>The so-called Southwest refers to the six provinces of Sichuan, Kang (former Xikang), Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Guangxi. Its area reaches over 5.7 million square miles, with a population of 130 million. The natural resources are abundant, yet much remains undeveloped. It is shielded by mountains and lakes, advantageous for military offense and defense. It also borders Myanmar and Vietnam, providing convenient international transportation. To the northwest are the provinces of Shaanxi, Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Gansu, offering a vast and magnificent world. With the war of resistance still ongoing, the Southwest is an inexhaustible source of manpower and resources. The key to victory lies here. However, discussions on the Southwest often mention that it has all the conditions for development except for a shortage of capital. But if we observe the Shanghai market, the trade deficit is huge, and speculation is rampant. Isn't this a sign of abundant floating capital? The so-called shortage of capital for developing the Southwest is not because China lacks capital, but simply because the capital does not flow to the Southwest. Why is this the case? Those who possess capital: lack foresight, firstly; lack ambition, secondly; ignore the dangers of speculation, mistakenly believing it to be a shortcut to wealth, thirdly; Shanghai and the Southwest have long had a lack of connection, with insufficient understanding of the Southwest, fourthly; the lifestyle and habits that make those accustomed to Shanghai life regard the Southwest as a daunting path, fifthly. These five reasons are not only true for Shanghai residents. Many wealthy overseas Chinese are extremely loyal to their homeland, but they know more about treaty ports and less about the situation in the Southwest. However, there are those like Chen Shouming, who organized the "China Western Reclamation and Industrial Company," and Hu Wenhu, who prepared the "Yunnan Border Overseas Chinese Industrial Model Zone," and there are many others whose plans are reportedly underway. In comparison, it is still not as enthusiastic as foreign financiers: In April of this year, the British Chartered Bank held its annual meeting, and its chairman strongly emphasized the importance of investing in the Southwest. American Standard Oil and British Asiatic Petroleum, two major oil companies, have established branches in Sichuan and Yunnan. Ford Motor Company and Dunlop Rubber Company are also planning to establish factories in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. All these concrete facts are not only limited to business operations, but also demonstrate confidence that the Chinese government has the power to ensure the safety of their investments, and that this vast virgin land has a bright future. Shanghai's floating capital has turned to speculation, mainly through buying and selling foreign exchange and hoarding goods. This directly leads to the soaring of the black market for foreign exchange and indirectly increases the burden on citizens. This is a painful reality. The root cause is the conflict between insufficient national consciousness and the pursuit of wealth. The phenomenon of forgetting righteousness for profit is unavoidable even in countries that implement economic control policies. However, the situation in Shanghai is particularly severe, so we must focus on Shanghai and find a way to remedy it. The way to remedy it is not to rely on scolding people for being greedy. Nor should we take this moral concept as the only starting point. We must understand that when examining the advantages and disadvantages, benefit and righteousness are inherently intertwined. The future trend of Shanghai is unpredictable. If Shanghai is like this today, it may not necessarily be like this in the future. Speculation may be tolerated today, and it may seem like there are many opportunities, but if there is a drastic change in the situation, all speculators will inevitably be sacrificed by this change. It is a pity that these people are too eager for profit and too short-sighted to see this. Therefore, we dare to loudly call for the awakening of Shanghai's speculators: The rise of speculative activities is enough to prove the decline of Shanghai's economic future! Speculation is essentially gambling, with gains and losses, and the danger is even greater in this volatile foreign exchange market. Furthermore, let's observe the reality of Shanghai's normal industry and commerce: soaring prices affect the purchasing power of citizens and reduce market demand, firstly; floating capital is almost exclusively occupied by speculative activities, and financial institutions are wary of lending to enterprises, making it increasingly difficult to circulate capital, secondly; products from the occupied areas are shipped to Shanghai, and the production equipment within the area is monopolized and manipulated, creating a "borrowing a corpse to return the soul" situation, which Shanghai's normal industrialists and businessmen cannot compete with, thirdly; domestic sales channels are closed due to blockades, fourthly. From all these, it can be seen that the "abnormal prosperity" within the isolated island is declining. Shanghai's floating capital is most likely to perish along with the speculative market. Why are those who possess capital so confused and staying in Shanghai? Leaving Shanghai for the Southwest is not only a matter of national consciousness. It is also inevitable to consider the advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, the door to investing in the Southwest is wide open, and the National Government has taken many measures, such as encouraging and protecting private industries, developing transportation, assisting the relocation of factories to the west, facilitating financial circulation, accepting miscellaneous currencies, remitting and paying in cash, and providing free foreign exchange remittances. All these are for the sake of those who are determined to develop the Southwest.</p>
<h3>U.S. Naval Force Gradually Concentrating in the Pacific, Conducting Exercises in Hawaii, Strength Unprecedented in History</h3>
<p>Washington - Since the outbreak of the European War, the main force of the U.S. Navy has gradually concentrated in the Pacific. This is the basic policy of the U.S. Navy's deployment during the war. Strategists have long held this view because after the outbreak of the war, the strength of the British Navy is sufficient to control the Atlantic Ocean. The main fleet of the U.S. Navy, led by Admiral Bloch, is still in San Pedro and Santiago. This fleet was suddenly ordered to return on April 15 during exercises in the Atlantic. This fleet has been stationed in the above two locations since March 1932, possessing twelve battleships, twelve heavy cruisers, fifteen light cruisers, four aircraft carriers, seventy destroyers, twelve submarines, and many other small ships. The naval base of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii has added fourteen submarines. The Far East Asian Fleet has two cruisers, thirty-six destroyers, and many submarines, gunboats, and small ships. Therefore, the naval strength of the U.S. Pacific Fleet is extremely strong. There is also a new Atlantic Fleet, led by Rear Admiral Deyo. The main force of this fleet is concentrated in Norfolk and Virginia, with three battleships. The already decommissioned battleship Wyoming has also been added. In addition, there are four heavy cruisers, one aircraft carrier, nineteen destroyers, plus fourteen submarines from the submarine bases of New London and New London. In the Caribbean region, there is also a naval task force with eleven destroyers and eleven gunboats. The Coco Solo base in the Panama Canal Zone also has six submarines and many small ships. The special European fleet, newly formed during the Spanish War, is now stationed in Villefranche-sur-Mer, France. After the completion of the great naval plan, it will dominate the globe, and its strength will be stronger than any other country. The newly completed heavy cruiser Wichita and light cruiser St. Louis will soon join the service. There are currently one hundred and two battleships under construction. (Reuter's report on the 2nd)</p>
<p>San Pedro - The U.S. Naval Headquarters announced last night that the government has dispatched fifteen battleships to Hawaii to participate in a major exercise. The departure time will not be announced due to the preservation of military secrets. The Fourth and Sixth Cruiser Squadrons, one aircraft carrier, and the "Florida" Destroyer Squadron will be the first units in the exercise. The cruisers heading to Hawaii are the "Northampton," "Salt Lake City," "Pensacola," "Houston," "Minneapolis," "Astoria," "New Orleans," and "Indianapolis." The "Florida" Destroyer Squadron has a total of thirty-four destroyers and two transports. According to observers, in recent months, the Navy Department will transfer about one hundred battleships to Pearl Harbor. The Navy Department's announcement stated that the Hawaiian exercise will be calculated in fleet units. The first unit will not leave before the second unit arrives. If the strength of the second unit exceeds the first unit, then one hundred battleships on the U.S. West Coast will be concentrated in Honolulu. The Navy Department's announcement stated that this major exercise is a "cruiser training" and that this matter has been under consideration for several months before it was held. This major deployment of naval forces has aroused different speculations from all walks of life, mainly to strengthen the Far East Asian Fleet. According to naval experts, in two months, the concentration of the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, in terms of quantity and strength, will be unprecedented in history. After Congress passes the new Neutrality Act, which prohibits U.S. merchant ships from transporting munitions to belligerent countries, more than one hundred U.S. merchant ships will also be transferred to the Pacific for shipping. (Reuter's report on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The U.S. Fleet Commander announced that the United States will dispatch eight Eastern cruisers, approximately thirty destroyers, and one aircraft carrier to concentrate in the Hawaiian Islands. After the news spread, it aroused the attention of military and political figures in Tokyo. The spokesman of the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated yesterday that Japanese Admiral Kanazawa clearly stated last Thursday that the Japanese Navy need not worry about the United States increasing its Hawaiian fleet. Under the current circumstances, it is not unusual for neutral countries to hold naval exercises. (Haitong Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Northern Poland, Isolated Troops Cease Resistance, Defenders of Hel Peninsula Surrender to Germany, Post-War Work Begins in Warsaw</h3>
<p>Berlin - The semi-official German News Agency reported that the defenders of Hel Peninsula in northern Poland (north of the Free City of Danzig) had resisted for a long time and raised a white flag today to cease resistance. They have sent representatives to negotiate surrender with the German commander. The last center of Polish resistance has been eliminated. (Havas report on the 1st)</p>
<p>Danzig - The defenders of the Hel Peninsula in Poland surrendered to the German army yesterday. According to Danzig newspapers, the island's defenders include 250 Polish officers and 400 soldiers. They have now been captured. When the German army attacked Hel, in order to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, they did not attack with heavy weapons. (Haitong Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Warsaw Front - According to a report from a special correspondent of the Haitong Agency from the Warsaw front, the front line has returned to a state of calm. Not long ago, the German and Polish armies were fighting fiercely here, but now both sides are silent, with only a few sentries stationed there, giving people the impression that this is still a war zone. The German army is now engaged in post-war work. The Poles are also busy cleaning the streets and removing obstacles. The landmines buried by the army are now being safely dug out. The bullet holes in the houses are also being filled. The tram lines that have fallen to the ground are either cut or reconnected, and the repairs are mostly completed. The lives of the residents are gradually returning to normal, and many refugees have also moved back. Except for the shops opened by Jews, the rest are gradually resuming business. The supply of various food items is still difficult to fully resolve for the time being. The authorities are now taking the fastest measures to resolve this urgent task. (Haitong Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin - Last night, officials here announced that the Polish garrison on the Hel Peninsula raised a white flag to surrender yesterday. The fighting ceased at 4 p.m. The German commander immediately met with the Polish envoy to conduct takeover negotiations. Since then, Poland's last base has also been abandoned. (Haitong Agency Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Danzig - The Beliner Börsen-Zeitung recently published a description by a Polish girl, Hui Ti, who arrived here yesterday, of the terrifying German air raid on Warsaw. According to her, many people died and had to be buried in holes dug in the streets and squares. Many babies were born in air-raid shelters, and many people died in air-raid shelters. Poles, regardless of gender or age, all showed great courage. Whenever someone was injured, the crowd risked their lives to rush out and carry the wounded to a safe place. Boys aged 15 to 18 were all called out to guard Gaholin, 38 miles outside Warsaw. This may have been the most terrible part of the whole tragedy. A reporter for the Politische Zeitung recently flew over Warsaw. According to him, many parts of Warsaw are still burning. He was shocked by the destroyed scene of Warsaw and could not speak. The four Germans in the plane were also shocked and remained silent, with pale faces, sitting silently. (Reuters report on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin - The General Headquarters recently issued a communiqué stating that our army began to enter Warsaw yesterday and the process went well. By evening, the vanguard had paraded in the town of Prague near Warsaw. The occupation measures were immediately completed. In addition, the defenders of the Hel Peninsula in northern Poland (north of the Free City of Danzig) had resisted for a long time. Last night, when our navy and army were preparing to jointly besiege, the defenders raised a white flag to surrender. Among them were 52 officers, including Admiral Anrog, the commander-in-chief of the Polish Navy. (Havas report on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin - To celebrate the German army's occupation of Warsaw and the end of the Polish war, Catholic and Protestant churches throughout Germany will ring their bells for one hour every day from 12 noon to 1 p.m., for seven consecutive days. The German command announced that the bells began ringing this afternoon after entering Warsaw. (Haitong Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Danzig - According to a Berlin dispatch from the Berliner Börsen-Zeitung, it is expected that Hitler will lead the German army in a triumphal entry into Warsaw on Tuesday. The German parliament is scheduled to meet on Thursday or Friday. According to previous reports, Hitler will announce his "peace" terms in parliament. (Reuters report on the 2nd)</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden - The Swedish ship "Asegard" was recently intercepted by a German warship and ordered to sail to Kiel, Germany. (Havas report on the 2nd)</p>
<p>London - According to a naval affairs reporter for the Daily Express, the second German submarine flotilla was originally supposed to sail to the Atlantic, but because activities in that area were very dangerous, it changed its course to the Baltic Sea and the Kattegat Strait (between Norway and Denmark). This is why the ships of various neutral countries in Scandinavia have been attacked by German submarines in recent days. (Havas report on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Amsterdam, Netherlands - The Dutch minesweeper "Van Gentai" accidentally detonated a mine laid by another country near Terschelling Island this morning, causing severe damage.

<h3>Chinese Troops in Northern Hunan Counterattack with Victory, Changsha Remains as Solid as a Rock, Japanese Return Route North of Fulinpu Cut Off, Fierce Fighting Between Shaguo and Huangsha Bridge in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Changsha - Since the Japanese troops invaded Dongting Lake and landed in Yingtian, they have devoted all their efforts to fiercely attacking the Huaxin, Xiangyin and Miluo fronts, intending to drive straight in and take Changsha in one fell swoop. Unexpectedly, they have been severely attacked by the defending Chinese troops everywhere, with countless casualties. Recently, the Japanese troops have been advancing south along the Yuehan Railway north of Qiaotouyi, losing troops and generals, but have not succeeded. At the same time, in the Fulinpu and Shangshanshi areas, they have been strongly resisted by the Chinese army, suffering heavy losses. The attacks on Jinjing were also frustrated, and all efforts were in vain. The Japanese troops have been running into walls everywhere, in a state of embarrassment. Although the war in northern Hunan has started with intense flames, after more than ten days of hard fighting by the Chinese troops, the Japanese have gained more losses than gains. Although they are approaching Changsha, in fact, their feet are sinking deeper and deeper, and they have a feeling of regretting their initial decision. At this moment, the Chinese troops around Changsha are becoming more stable and have been counterattacking in maneuvers for days, achieving great success, successively capturing key points such as Wanggong Bridge, Lijiaduan, and Shangshanshi, proving that the Chinese army is becoming stronger in the battle. The exhausted Japanese troops are in a situation of thorns everywhere and are uneasy. Given the past disastrous defeat in Taierzhuang and intimidated by the high combat capability of the Chinese troops' group operations, they are hesitating and not moving forward, fearing repeating the same mistakes. Judging from the current battlefield situation, the Chinese army will have more rapid progress. The Japanese Abe's crazy words of occupying Changsha on October 1st have been completely undermined, and Changsha remains as solid as a rock, only showing his bragging and making him a laughingstock to the world. The so-called all-out invasion of China is nothing more than that. (Hai Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Hengyang - Since the outbreak of the war in northern Hunan, the Japanese have planned to invade Changsha with the strength of three divisions. After the Yingtian battle started, the Japanese troops attempted to attack the Chinese flanks and join forces in Miluo, but the Chinese troops in Xinqiang remained firm and did not move. After inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese, they began a strategic shift. In the battle on the south bank of the Miluo River, after several days of fierce fighting, more than 4,000 stubborn Japanese troops were annihilated. The price paid in this Dongting Lake battle was exactly the same as in the Lunan battle. The fierce fighting around Changsha has been unfolding for days. Because the Chinese have favorable terrain in the Yonganshi and Jinjing lines, they have been making greater use of mobile tactics and ambushes everywhere, resulting in heavier losses for the Japanese. The Japanese have been using two divisions to coordinate with northern Jiangxi, invading Tongcheng and Pingjiang. Because the Chinese have favorable mountainous terrain, the Japanese cannot exert their strength on this front. In the past two weeks, the Japanese army has suffered more than 13,000 casualties. After suffering this unprecedented blow, the Japanese attempt to invade Changsha has been clearly frustrated, and the Chinese army has achieved its predetermined goals of attrition warfare and mountain warfare. The Japanese dream of invading Changsha has been shattered by China. (Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Changsha - The victorious news of the Chinese army's counterattack in northern Hunan: the Japanese divisions, totaling 100,000 troops, that crossed the Miluo River to invade the south were lured deep by the Chinese, who set up ambushes layer by layer and attacked the waist section by section. In the past five days, countless Japanese troops have been killed. The Chinese army's counterattack on the 1st was particularly fierce. The commanders personally went to the front line to command, boosting morale. The scattered Japanese troops were all defeated separately. The Chinese then took advantage of the victory to recover key points such as Wugong Bridge (northeast of Qiaotouyi) and Lijiaduan (northwest of Fulinpu), capturing many prisoners. A part of the Chinese army has advanced to the north of Fulinpu, cutting off the Japanese return route. The 2,000 remaining Japanese troops near Shangshanshi have fallen into heavy encirclement and cannot retreat. (Telegraph at 5 p.m. on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to people in the transportation industry speaking to a reporter from the Associated Press, the railway tracks north and south of Changsha have been completely dismantled, so Changsha is now, in fact, no longer a railway center. The recent pause in the Japanese army's advance around Changsha is partly due to the fierce resistance of the Chinese army, but also partly because the Japanese fear that their rear will be cut off after a light advance and that they will be deeply encircled.

<h3>The Aspirations of the Chinese People Will Surely Be Respected by the Great Powers - The Opinion of Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued a statement today, saying: Regarding the rumors that some countries are willing to end the Sino-Japanese war as soon as possible since the outbreak of the European war, I believe that the great powers will surely respect the aspirations and goals of the Chinese people. We must wait until China completes the goals of this war of resistance before we can talk about peace. The National Government is the only legitimate and recognized authority to decide on peace and war. The great powers will not attach importance to any decision made by the puppet regime on this matter. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek then mentioned the issue of the great powers recognizing the puppet regime, only stating that he believes that no country is willing to violate the emotions of the entire Chinese people, because the purely puppet nature of such a regime is very obvious and need not be elaborated. Even if this kind of recognition is actually realized, it will not have any impact on China's position. It should be known that although Germany and Italy have recognized "Manchukuo" for two years, the Manchurian problem is still unresolved. (Reuters report on the 2nd)</p>

<h3>Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Announce Domestic and Foreign Policy: Maintain Neutrality in the European War and Focus on Resolving the Sino-Japanese War, Hoping to Gain Understanding from the United States and Resolve Issues with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Tokyo: At the meeting of local governors on the 2nd, Foreign Minister Nomura delivered a speech thoroughly explaining Japan's foreign policy. He said, "At the meeting of local governors in May of this year, Foreign Minister Arita explained that the Japanese government was adopting a policy of strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy and was negotiating with Germany and Italy. However, the situation in Europe subsequently underwent rapid changes, centering on the Danzig issue. On August 24, Germany and the Soviet Union actually concluded a non-aggression pact, and the aforementioned negotiations were terminated. After the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, the situation in Europe deteriorated. On August 31, German and Polish forces began fighting. On September 3, Britain and France both declared war on Germany in accordance with their promise to Poland. The German army swept through most of Poland with lightning speed in a matter of days. On September 17, the Soviet Union suddenly sent troops into Poland and occupied its eastern regions without bloodshed. The Soviet Union's decision to send troops into Poland was presumably the result of a prior understanding with Germany. After the Soviet army's advance, the German army gradually decided to retreat, and now the Soviet Union occupies about half of the Polish territory in the oil region. On September 29, Germany and the Soviet Union signed an agreement in Moscow on demarcating the new borders of the two countries. The origins of this European war are extremely profound, and its future is difficult to predict. It is feared that it will last for a long time, but it differs somewhat from the previous European war, containing more diplomatic, economic, and ideological warfare than military warfare. After receiving news of Britain and France declaring war on Germany, the Japanese government temporarily decided on a policy of 'At this time when the European war has broken out, Japan will not join the war and will concentrate on resolving the China Incident', and announced this to China and foreign countries on September 4. In the case of a state of war occurring between third countries, any non-participating country automatically enjoys and bears the rights and obligations of neutrality under international law, regardless of whether a declaration of neutrality has been made. Therefore, the Japanese government's statement on September 4 can be said to be Japan's statement of its attitude towards the European war in a certain sense. The reason for adopting this method of expression is to imply that Japan's policy is always based on resolving the China Incident, and its foreign policy and attitude towards third countries are also determined based on this basis. The Japanese government plans to implement a multi-faceted and comprehensive foreign policy after fully considering the situation in Europe in accordance with its established policy for handling the Incident, in order to cope with the current extraordinary situation. Judging from a synthesis of various information, what Japan seeks from China is political and economic cooperation between Japan and China. It would be wrong to think that Japan intends to close the door to China and exclude the economic activities of third countries. Japan has consistently sought to eliminate the concerns of third countries on this point and will continue to take extra steps to express this attitude and induce third countries to abandon their pro-Chiang attitude. As for relations with Britain, the so-called Anglo-Japanese talks were held in Tokyo in July of this year. As a result, Britain recognized in principle that within the region under the influence of Japanese military power in China, Britain would control its actions that harmed our interests and benefited the enemy. However, with regard to the specific handling of the Tianjin issue, Britain did not agree to our demands, and the meeting broke down. Regarding the United States, Japan intends to continue its efforts in the future so that the United States can fully understand Japan's true intentions. Regarding relations with the Soviet Union, as a result of negotiations in Moscow regarding the Nomonhan Incident, an armistice agreement was concluded on September 15 between Ambassador Togo and Foreign Minister Molotov. The government plans to gradually resolve the outstanding issues between Japan and the Soviet Union in the future." (Domei News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Prime Minister Abe said in his address at the local governors' meeting: "The government issued a statement earlier, starting with the essence of the national polity. We firmly believe that clarifying the concept of the national polity, based on the spirit of Japan's traditions since the founding of the nation, that is, the spirit of supporting the imperial fortunes and the spirit of serving the public and sacrificing private interests, and focusing on all aspects of internal and external administration to guide and develop today's era, is the primary duty of the national government. The current domestic and foreign policies are based on this spirit. Hereby, I seek your understanding and cooperation on two or three of the current important tasks listed therein: (1) The current international situation is complex and delicate, and its trends are unpredictable. Japan cannot be content with complacency in this situation. It must stand on its own position, ensure Japan's position, uphold its claims, and open up opportunities for reform. Moreover, Japan's greatest problem today is the handling of the China Incident and the construction of a new order in East Asia. Therefore, it is necessary to place the core of policy in the handling of the China Incident and integrate and concentrate all internal and external policies under this objective. The fundamental policy for handling the China Incident has been decided and will not change with the change of the cabinet. The new central government will also be established soon. The Japanese government is determined to further assist its establishment and cooperate with it to complete the handling of the Incident. However, it would be a mistake to regard the establishment of the new central government as the end of the Incident. Today, our mission is not only to restore peace. The highest goal of our handling of the Incident is the integration of China, Japan, and Manchuria. No matter how the international situation changes, this goal is unshakeable. Therefore, although we have declared that we will not participate in the war when the European war breaks out, this is by no means merely to stand aloof and watch from the sidelines. If there are those who understand Japan's position and are willing to cooperate in improving the situation in East Asia, Japan will regard them as friendly countries and jointly cooperate in the progress of East Asia and the world. Otherwise, Japan will also seize all opportunities and make all efforts to guide them to an appropriate position. As for countries that are unwilling to understand Japan's sincerity with malice, Japan has no choice but to resolve to deal with them with decisive measures. (2) In order to handle the China Incident, it is necessary to pay attention to the trends of other countries and eliminate matters that hinder the construction of a new order in East Asia. Domestically, we must vigorously strengthen military preparations and concentrate on cultivating national strength. The current state of affairs within the country has reached a point where various departments and levels cannot be allowed to develop arbitrarily and in a non-uniform manner. Therefore, we must make extra efforts to expand comprehensive economic power, make its use effective, and strengthen the national general mobilization system. For this reason, it is necessary to promote the implementation of the production capacity expansion plan and establish an integrated plan for China, Japan, and Manchuria. Therefore, we intend to hasten the establishment of new trade merchants and the strengthening and improvement of other trade systems. In order to ensure that the country's strength is exerted most effectively, we are currently promoting the initiation of the National General Mobilization Law and planning the wartime systemization of industry and economy. This requires the entire nation to promote its spirit of public service in order to achieve perfect results. Therefore, officials must first advocate and practice it for the people, so that the people can truly understand its purpose." (Domei News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<h3>American Writer Talks About Japan's Intentions</h3>
<p>Honolulu: American writer Mr. Lamb, who resided in China for 25 years, arrived here today and is about to return to the United States. According to his observations, the foreign concessions in Shanghai and Tianjin, as well as Hong Kong, will inevitably be taken over by the Japanese during the course of this European war, but it will not be long before they are. Moreover, signs of economic collapse have already been found in Japan's war against China. (United Press of America, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Members of the New Polish Government Sworn In, the United States Considers the Issue of Recognition</h3>
<p>Paris: Under the leadership of Prime Minister General Sikorski, the Polish government was sworn into office here yesterday. Former Polish President Mościcki is currently being detained in Romania. He resigned on Saturday and transferred his powers to former Senate Speaker Raczkiewicz. The new president expressed his respect for the Polish nation and people and awarded Warsaw the Virtuti Militari military cross. The government decided to invite the pianist-statesman Paderewski to cooperate. Sikorski told reporters that he intended to meet with French Prime Minister Daladier today to discuss the status of the Polish government in France. He hoped to organize six to eight divisions of Polish troops to continue fighting the German army on the Western Front. He will appeal to the 500,000 Polish people living in the United States, requesting them to join the Polish army. (United Press of America, 2nd)</p>
<p>Paris: The Polish Embassy in France issued a communique stating, "Members of the new Polish government paid a visit to the new President Raczkiewicz this morning and were sworn into office. President Raczkiewicz also decided to invite former President Paderewski to come out of retirement and support the new Polish government." Paderewski, a virtuoso pianist and Polish patriot, is over seventy years old and has contributed to the restoration of Poland during the last European war. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Washington: The new Polish government was declared established in Paris, and the Polish ambassador to the United States, Potocki, has notified the US State Department. Diplomatic circles here have commented that the US government recognizes this government as the legal successor to the original legitimate government of Poland in accordance with the constitution, and it is not necessary to issue recognition procedures again. US Ambassador to Poland Biddle will continue to serve in Paris as usual, and Secretary of State Hull will also express his continued recognition in his reply. In addition, the issue of recognition is quite delicate if the talk of establishing a new Czech government in Paris comes to fruition. The US government has not decided on its attitude, because Czech President Beneš has resigned, and he has no authority to organize a new government in accordance with the constitution. However, given the circumstances of Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic, there is still much room for research on whether the current government in Prague is the government of our constitution. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Berlin: The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating that after Polish President Mościcki resigned, the Polish cabinet held a meeting in Sinaia, Romania, yesterday to discuss the aftermath and then issued a communique. It is reported that Mościcki and all members of the Polish cabinet are still "residing in Romania." Romanian political figures also stated that "Although Mościcki has resigned, he and the members of his cabinet are still political figures and should be taken care of. Romania's strict implementation of its neutrality policy will not be changed as a result." (Havas, 2nd)</p>

Hungary is now situated between two major powers, Germany with a population of 90 million and the Soviet Union with vast resources. Which should it follow, Qi or Chu?" Former Foreign Minister Gratacz wrote in "Napló", "Today, Hungary should adjust its foreign policy in accordance with the Three Emperors' League plan drafted by Bismarck and Andrássy. Hungary should fulfill its humble mission and devote its full efforts to promoting good relations with neighboring countries and eliminating the possibility of friction." (Haitong, 2nd)</p>

They also intruded into the airspace of Chengdu City, dropped bombs, and then hurriedly turned back, attempting to escape along their original route. However, it was already late at night, and white fog filled the air. The Japanese planes then scattered in groups of three or five, searching for a way out. They still fled east along the river. The Chongqing Air Defense Command issued an emergency alert, which was lifted only after the Japanese planes had flown far away. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Slight Chaos on the Kowloon Border</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: The situation on the border of the leased territory this morning is slightly chaotic. Six Japanese planes attacked the area near Fangling (transliteration) yesterday and are still active. It is understood that the Japanese army still occupies several villages on the border. News in Chinese newspapers of a large-scale attack by the Chinese army seems to be exaggerated. According to independent investigations, the Chinese army involved in the battle of Shatoujiao yesterday was very small in number. However, it is understood that 4,000 Chinese soldiers have indeed arrived near the border, so it is expected that the fighting will continue to develop. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to reliable sources today, Chinese guerrillas on the Kowloon border have cut off the Japanese army's transportation line between Nantou, Shenzhen, and Shatoujiao. It is also heard that Japanese naval landing forces have landed in Mirs Bay to prevent Chinese forces from Huizhou from reinforcing the Chinese forces on the Kowloon border.

<h3>Diary of Japanese Planes' Frenzied Bombing of Guangdong and Guangxi: Southern Guangdong and Liuzhou Suffer Greatly, Chinese Air Force Intercepts Over Liuzhou</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Over the past month, Japanese planes have attacked towns in Guangdong and Guangxi countless times, causing severe disasters. A comprehensive record of the situation in various places is as follows:</p>
<p>August 29th: Twenty-one Japanese planes indiscriminately bombed Nanning and Wuming in Guangxi Province. Seventeen bombs were dropped in Wuming. The Weiwenguang Theater, the foot of the city wall north of the theater, and other places were hit. The theater was destroyed, as well as a Christian church. More than ten civilian houses were also destroyed, and one man was injured. Six bombs fell on Santang Road, including a dud bomb, causing little damage, except for three large ox carts slightly damaged by Japanese planes' machine gun strafing. At the same time, thirteen bombs fell on Xinyu Street in Sitang, destroying a certain Suo Li hall, more than ten civilian houses, killing one man, one woman, and two children, and injuring nine men and women. Three bombs fell near Wutang Road, destroying one postal vehicle. On the same day, Japanese planes flew to Fangcheng and Bailongwei to bomb, destroying two civilian houses and injuring two poor people. In the early morning of the 30th, two batches of seven Japanese planes invaded Guangxi Province and bombed Guixian, wreaking havoc before heading out to sea. A third batch of nine Japanese planes flew to Hengxian and divided into two batches. One attacked Wuzhou and wreaked havoc, bombing before heading out to sea. A fourth batch of nine Japanese planes also flew to Nanning in Guangxi Province to bomb, then headed out to sea via Santang. A fifth batch of nine Japanese planes bombed Longzhou and Pingxiang, with unknown losses. In the afternoon, another nine Japanese planes broke into Qianjiang, repeatedly bombing. At the same time, another eight Japanese planes reconnoitered Yongnao, Binyang, Douxu, Shanglin, and Qianjiang. After the previous batch of Japanese planes bombed Qianjiang, the eight planes followed and flew back out to sea.</p>
<p>On the morning of September 1st, nine Japanese planes invaded the county seat of Maoming County in Guangdong Province, dropping fifteen bombs, killing and injuring several people. The remaining losses were temporarily unknown. The Japanese planes, showing their ferocity, invaded Gaozhou again, circling and reconnoitering before heading south. On the same morning, six Japanese planes invaded the county seat of Lianjiang County, destroying six civilian houses and injuring two people. Another seventeen Japanese planes invaded Guangxi Province, flying from Binyang to Liuzhou and bombing. Another batch of eight planes flew northwest from Hechi to attack Guangxi, reaching Baoyang and dropping bombs twice, with unknown losses. Another eight Japanese planes invaded Huaxian County in Guangdong Province, circling and reconnoitering before dropping eight bombs. The auditorium of a certain middle school and the head seat of a vocational school were destroyed, killing and injuring more than seventy people, marking the most tragic air disaster in Huaxian since the air raids began.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 2nd, eleven Japanese planes invaded Guangxi, dropping eight bombs over Guixian, landing near a certain railway station, sugar factory, and in the suburbs, destroying seven or eight civilian houses and killing and injuring two people. A second batch of six Japanese planes bombed Gaoyao City in Guangdong Province, dropping fourteen bombs, with eight landing near the Guangkou factory, three in Qingguan Cemetery, and three near a certain hospital, with unknown casualties.</p>
<p>At 6:00 AM on the morning of the 4th, five Japanese planes flew north from Hainan Island, passing through Qinzhou and Xiaodong, and invading Nanning's airspace in Guangxi Province, before attacking Wuming. At 8:03 AM, they invaded Binyang's airspace, dropping many bombs, before heading south via Hutao. At 7:46 AM on the same morning, six Japanese planes arrived at Longtan, part of Bobai County in Guangxi Province, and invaded Yulin's airspace, dropping more than ten bombs, which exploded immediately, destroying nine civilian houses and injuring two civilians. The Japanese planes also fired more than a thousand rounds of machine gun fire. At 2:08 PM, they dropped more than ten explosive and incendiary bombs over Yulin again, setting three fires in the city. After dropping the bombs, the Japanese planes strafed with machine guns before flying west. At 2:12 PM, they dropped several bombs in Bailong under the jurisdiction of Yuye, heading south. At around 10:00 AM on the same morning, eleven Japanese planes arrived over Guixian and dropped dozens of bombs before fleeing south. At 2:43 PM, twenty-five Japanese planes were discovered over Hepu in Guangdong Province, heading towards Liuzhou. The brave Chinese Air Force took off from a certain location and waited in the air to engage them. At 3:27 PM, when the Japanese planes broke into Liuzhou's airspace, the Chinese planes engaged them in an aerial battle, lasting for more than ten minutes. The Japanese planes then hastily dropped dozens of bombs before rushing back to their original routes. At 4:22 PM, they passed through Guixian again and dropped several bombs before heading out to sea. This time, the Japanese planes attacked Liuzhou, setting fire to civilian houses in the north and south of the river several times, which were only extinguished at night. It was found that the Japanese planes had dispatched a total of fifty-two planes to bomb Baoyang, Yulin, Guixian, Liuzhou, and other places that day, demonstrating their increasingly fierce acts of aggression.</p>
<h3>Severe Rice Shortage in Zhangzhou, Price Per Catty Reaches 1.5 Yuan, Authorities Have No Relief Measures</h3>
<p>Zhangzhou Correspondence: Zhangzhou has fertile land and abundant products. The amount of grains, fruits, and other agricultural products transported to other ports each year reaches several million yuan. In the past, the amount transported to Quanzhou and Xiamen each year also reached tens of thousands of yuan. After Xiamen Island fell, maritime transport was blockaded by Japanese warships, and the rural economy showed signs of exhaustion. This summer, Zhangzhou has suffered repeated floods, especially in mid-June when the early rice was just ripening and was flooded for several days, resulting in the greatest losses. The early rice harvest was sharply reduced. After the late rice was transplanted, it was repeatedly flooded, resulting in many losses as well. As a result, rice merchants and wealthy farmers, who were experienced, knew the inevitable trend of rising rice prices and rushed to buy and hoard large quantities. Smuggling merchants, because of the high profits from selling rice in Gulangyu at high prices, disregarded national laws and popular outrage and stepped up smuggling, transporting rice to Gulangyu. In addition, the neighboring areas of Quanzhou and other counties could not self-supply rice, and both military and civilian food supplies had to rely on Zhangzhou. Under these circumstances, an unprecedented rice shortage was created, creating the ridiculous situation where people in rice-producing areas had no rice to eat.</p>
<p>In the past, during the summer and autumn seasons after the early rice harvest, the price of rice in Zhangzhou was about one yuan for two "dou". Even if it was slightly more expensive, it would only cost a few extra cents. Even during the winter, when rice prices were high, it would only be about one yuan. At that time, many people were already complaining, but who knew that this July, the price of rice in Zhangzhou would break a hundred-year record, with new rice selling for more than 1.2 yuan per "dou," an unprecedented strange phenomenon. And recently, there has been a tragic situation where people with money cannot buy rice. Many poor people have been without food for several days because they have nowhere to buy rice, and there have even been a few old people who committed suicide because they could not buy rice.</p>
<p>The local authorities have paid attention to providing relief for the rice shortage, but have never found an appropriate solution. Initially, they worked hard under the "Price Stabilization Committee," trying to lower rice prices. However, this method was superficial and played into the hands of the rice merchants. Because the "Price Stabilization Committee" nominally suppressed rice prices, large and small rice shops all announced that they had no rice. Therefore, people who wanted to buy rice had to be on good terms with the rice shop owners and sign a pledge not to reveal the secret before they could buy some rice at the "highest" price, which was more than the standard price set by the Price Stabilization Committee by 10 cents or more per person. Only a small amount could be purchased. Large quantities of rice were secretly dispersed and hoarded in the suburbs, and were smuggled out to take advantage of the price difference.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the severity of the rice shortage problem was beyond the power of the Price Stabilization Committee to resolve, so the authorities organized a "Grain Regulation Committee" and decided to implement grain control. However, the work was only done superficially, and the actual effects were not significant. People still had no rice to eat everywhere. Under the control, the price of rice has risen to 1.5 yuan for new rice and more than 2 yuan for old rice. If this situation continues, who can say that social order will not be affected?</p>

<h3>Common Required Courses for University Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce Colleges (Part 1) Recently Announced by the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Supplement): The Ministry of Education has previously formulated and promulgated an order for the common required courses for the three colleges of arts, sciences, and law. Now, it has formulated the common required courses for the three colleges of agriculture, industry, and commerce, and promulgated an order. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>College of Agriculture: The common required courses are prescribed as follows: Chinese Language, Agronomy or Horticulture, each 4 credits; Foreign Language, Chemistry, each 6 to 8 credits; Botany, 6 credits; Zoology, 3 to 6 credits; Geology, 3 to 4 credits; Economics and Agricultural Economics, 4 to 6 credits; Farm Practice, 2 credits, totaling 38 to 44 credits. The distribution is divided into two years, for example, in the first academic year: Chinese Language, 4 credits, divided into 2 credits for the first semester and 2 credits for the second semester; Foreign Language and Chemistry, each 6 to 8 credits, with 3 to 4 credits for each semester. The rest can be inferred by analogy. However, Economics and Agricultural Economics, 4 to 6 credits, are listed as 1 credit in the first semester of the first academic year, and 2 to 3 credits in each semester of the second academic year. In total, each subject has 17 to 21 credits in the first semester and 17 to 21 credits in the second semester of the first academic year, and 2 to 3 credits in each semester of the second academic year. (Note): Chinese Language and Foreign Language require writing an essay every two weeks. In addition to the above required courses, Party Ideology, Physical Education, and Military Training are all compulsory courses and do not count towards credits. Physics and Mathematics are required courses for the Agricultural Engineering Department, Agricultural Chemistry Department, and Forestry Department. Each school may teach them in the first two academic years, but they are not listed in the above-mentioned courses. For subjects with 3 to 4, 3 to 6, or 6 to 8 credits, each school may decide on the number of credits within this provision, taking the circumstances into account. In addition to the above required courses, Party Ideology, Physical Education, and Military Training are all compulsory courses and do not count towards credits.</p>
<p>College of Commerce: The common required courses are prescribed as follows: Chinese Language, Mathematics, Economics, and Public Finance, each 6 credits; Foreign Language, 6 to 8 credits; Commercial History and Economic Geography, each 3 to 4 credits; Introduction to Law, 4 to 6 credits; Accounting, 8 to 10 credits, totaling 48 to 56 credits. The distribution is divided into two years, with Commercial History (3 to 4 credits) listed in the first year, and Introduction to Law (4 to 6 credits) listed in both semesters of the second year. In total, each subject has 19 to 22 credits in both semesters of the first year, and 5 to 6 credits in both semesters of the second year. (Note): Chinese Language and Foreign Language require writing an essay every two weeks. Commercial History includes both Chinese and world parts. Mathematics focuses on applications in commerce. In addition to the above required courses, Party Ideology, Physical Education, and Military Training are all compulsory courses and do not count towards credits. For subjects with 3 to 4, 4 to 6, 6 to 8, or 8 to 10 credits, each school may decide on the number of credits within this provision, taking the circumstances into account.</p>
<h3>Trends in Teacher Education in Various Countries (4) – The UK's Laissez-faire System</h3>
<p>Teacher education in European continental countries, from beginning to end, has always been under the principle of national leadership, each pursuing its own policy of teacher control. However, the island nation of England seems to disregard this surging trend and maintains its consistent traditional spirit of freedom, namely a laissez-faire system. Examining the issue of teachers in the UK, initially there was Burgess, who advocated the so-called pupil-teacher system, also known as the senior student-teacher system. In 1835, Lobach proposed to emulate France and establish normal schools, but it was not approved by Parliament. In 1839, the national normal school movement was once brewing, but it was opposed by religious education groups, resulting in no outcome. Only the Battersea Training College, founded privately, was realized and subsequently received government subsidies. By 1850, as many as sixteen private normal schools received government subsidies. Students in these schools who wished to become teachers could receive government subsidies for their tuition. This pupil-teacher system was originally introduced from the Netherlands and later coexisted with the senior student-teacher system. Some traces of it may still remain today. In 1848, the government subsidized private normal schools for their construction costs and also provided ongoing maintenance fees. Therefore, in fact, the expenses of teacher education in England were already borne by the government. In the United States, Franklin founded a teacher training institute in Philadelphia in 1749, marking the beginning of normal schools in America. In 1823, a private normal school appeared in Vermont, significantly influenced by the Prussian normal school at the time. Cousin's report on Prussian public education was translated and published for Americans. The book's content provided detailed information about the public schools in Prussia, and its introduction stimulated the development of public education. Consequently, James Carter, known as the "father of American teacher education," also vigorously recommended to the Massachusetts legislature in 1838 the passage of a bill to establish normal schools. The following year, he realized his plan in Lexington. Subsequently, various states followed suit, promoting it continuously. Therefore, in form, American teacher education is not entirely the same as that in England, but in essence, it is largely similar, as the selection of subjects and the design of curricula are all left to the freedom of the school authorities.</p>
<p>The English government has always adopted a supportive attitude towards teacher education, not only for private educational training initiatives but also for teacher training departments attached to universities or higher education institutions, which also receive subsidies to promote their development. From 1902, secondary schools in larger university districts were also permitted to establish normal schools, with the construction costs borne by the national treasury. As a result, those aspiring to become teachers could study at secondary schools, and the pupil-teacher system gradually disappeared. Currently, the common background of elementary school teachers in England is to transfer from secondary schools to normal schools or university teacher training departments. The age of admission to secondary schools is twelve, still in early childhood, and they should not be required to consider their future and make a decision. At sixteen, they should first take the preferential student examination. Those who pass receive generous treatment such as exemption from tuition fees. Those who aspire to become teachers can enter normal schools or university teacher training departments at seventeen after passing an examination. However, the qualifications for admission primarily emphasize health certificates and identity certificates, with importance also placed on appearance and demeanor. After 1928, normal schools were removed from the supervision of the central government and were managed by local education departments. Religious and non-religious organizations could also operate them. In 1931, there were 74 two-year normal schools nationwide, including one attached to a university, 22 established by local education departments, 39 belonging to religious organizations, and 12 belonging to non-religious organizations. The construction costs of the latter two were subsidized by the education department, while the maintenance costs were raised by the founders themselves. As for university teacher training departments, there were 21 nationwide between 1930 and 1931. The duration of study was three years, which was later extended by one year due to the heavy burden of degree preparation and professional preparation. The first three years were for students to engage in degree preparation, and the last year was for professional preparation.</p>
<p>There are two sources of secondary school teachers in England. One is that after graduation from a university, they work as probationary teachers in secondary schools with the lowest remuneration, learning educational theory and receiving practical guidance during that time. After one year, they undergo a qualification examination and can obtain a teaching license. The other is that university graduates, or those who aspire to become elementary school teachers and enter university teacher training departments, transfer to the secondary school teacher program after obtaining a degree in a specialized subject, studying educational theory, teaching methods, educational psychology, educational hygiene, and educational history. After acquiring a foundation, the university teacher training department designates a secondary school where they undergo at least 60 days of practical training under the guidance of the school's teachers or university teacher training professors to supplement their experience. Then, they undergo a qualification examination and can also obtain a teaching license. This examination takes into account their research papers and internship records from the past year, not just their performance at the time. English universities have two types: specialized colleges and undergraduate colleges, each with its own degree. The aforementioned transfer to the university teacher training department requires first obtaining either one of these degrees. This completes the academic cultivation of teachers within the university. However, in general, secondary schools prefer teachers with specialized degrees to those with undergraduate degrees. However, in reality, the employment of teachers in secondary schools is absolutely not based on the presence or absence of degrees and licenses, but solely on their personality, athletic skills, participation in students' joint activities, and ability to guide students effectively.</p>
<p>Adult Compulsory Schools</p>
<p>Thirty Classes to Be Opened</p>
<p>The Shanghai Adult Education Promotion Association, in order to promote adult compulsory education, is specifically organizing adult classes for compulsory schools, divided into three types: self-operated, specially invited, and joint ventures. All three types are currently progressing smoothly. The existing thirty classes have already been opened, and it is reported that continuous progress is still being made, with fifty classes expected to be opened by the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Delayed Announcement of the List of New Students for National Colleges and Universities in the Shanghai Region: Limited Enrollment in Colleges and Universities Requires Expansion Efforts</h3>
<p>The list of new students admitted to national colleges and universities in the Shanghai region for this year's unified enrollment was originally scheduled to be fully announced yesterday (the 4th) by Chongqing Cen Suishu, but it was suddenly terminated for some reason. According to inquiries from relevant parties yesterday, the number of Shanghai examinees applying for the six science and engineering schools in Shanghai was extremely high, and their scores were quite good. For the sake of students' academic pursuits, the Ministry of Education is also increasing the enrollment quota. However, the originally planned enrollment quotas of the colleges and universities are limited, making it difficult to expand them temporarily. Efforts are currently being made to resolve this issue within days. Furthermore, the allocation of students to various schools has also been quite difficult. It is expected that a solution will be determined within a short period, after which the list will be announced.</p>

<h3>Finance: The Talk of Negative News Suddenly Intensifies, Cash Plummets in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local cash market in Shanghai first rose and then suddenly plummeted, retreating into the 4,100 yuan range. This was due to rumors of favorable news for Chinese finance, and at the same time, the formerly tight foreign exchange market suddenly eased. In the morning, helped by money changers and Hong Kong customers buying, the upward trend was further aided by the tightening of foreign exchange, once reaching a high price of 4,150 yuan. Subsequently, under the dual pressure of selling from silver shops and gold firms, it gradually became unsustainable. In the afternoon, rumors of a possible devaluation of the Chinese currency spread widely, which would benefit Chinese finance as a whole, causing foreign exchange to suddenly ease. Securities firms (acting on behalf of customers), cash silver shops, and gold firms rushed to dump their holdings. Although the gold firms absorbed a large quantity, the money changers sold first and then bought, but it was still difficult to reverse the already weakened trend. The price plummeted to a low of 4,035 yuan at the close, falling 65 yuan. The market sentiment turned from firm to weak. The total volume of transactions increased from sparse to large, from 500-600 taels in the morning to 1,200-1,300 taels in the afternoon. Jewelry gold fell by 5 yuan to 410 yuan. Central English pure gold and Customs Gold remained stable.</p>
<p>Cash Falls 65 Yuan</p>
<p>The price of cash opened firm in the morning, due to the weakness of foreign exchange. A money changer first shouted to buy, but few sellers were willing, and the price opened 20 yuan higher. A money changer then sold 50 taels to a silver shop at a price of 4,120 yuan. After the opening, Hong Kong customers suddenly entrusted a silver shop, a gold firm, and a money changer to buy, and although some gold firms and silver shops supplied each other, the price continued to rise by 30 yuan because foreign exchange was still softening. A money changer sold 20 taels to a gold firm for 4,150 yuan. At this time, another money changer suddenly started selling, and the Hong Kong customer, having bought enough, became unsustainable and fell back, immediately losing 30 yuan. A silver shop sold 20 taels to a gold firm for 4,120 yuan. Afterwards, securities firms suddenly came to buy, with high prices. The price soon rose by 25 yuan, and a money changer sold 10 taels to a credit customer for 4,145 yuan. Near noon, it was heard that foreign exchange had slightly strengthened, and buyers immediately became wary. A gold firm then came to dump, and the price immediately fell by 25 yuan. A gold firm sold 30 taels to a silver shop for 4,120 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning. It was heard that the situation was even weaker after the close, and the price of 4,112 yuan was traded. The afternoon opened relatively stable, with a gold firm first selling 30 taels to a money changer for 4,120 yuan. After the opening, due to rumors of some kind of negative news in the market, and at the same time, the sudden easing of foreign exchange caused market sentiment to weaken. A money changer and a gold firm competed to sell, and the price immediately plummeted by 75 yuan. Money changers traded 20 taels with each other for 4,045 yuan. At this time, a silver shop came to absorb on behalf of a Hong Kong customer, and a gold firm also made profits and bought back, once rising by 25 yuan. A gold firm sold 20 taels to a money changer for 4,070 yuan. After entering, many securities firms suddenly came to close their positions, and the cash gold firms also had a strong desire to sell, so the price fell again, losing 35 yuan. A gold firm sold 10 taels to a money changer for 4,035 yuan. The closing price last night fell sharply by 65 yuan compared to the end of last week. It was heard that the trend was slightly more stable after the close, and gold firms traded 30 taels with each other at a price of 4,045 yuan. Then a money changer traded 10 taels at a price of 4,050 yuan. The price fluctuated by 115 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold firms' own-brand gold was 10 yuan higher than that of cash gold, and the buying price had to be reduced by more than 30 yuan. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Falls 5 Yuan</p>
<p>The asking price for silver shop jewelry gold was initially 415 yuan per tael at Da Tong Hang. At 10:07 AM, it rose by 5 yuan, and at noon it fell back by 5 yuan. At 2:30 PM, it fell by 5 yuan, and there was no change after that. As a result, Da Tong Hang changed its listing to 410 yuan, and the new shops had the same price. The buying price had to be reduced by about 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Currencies Fall Across the Board</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies started firm and then weakened. The US dollar bill initially traded at 14.06 yuan, and then gradually retreated into the 14 yuan range. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange market suddenly eased, and the price of gold fell sharply, so the selling pressure was great. The US dollar bill fell to 13.7 yuan, down 0.23 yuan from last Saturday. The English gold bill fell by 0.7 yuan, the English pound fell by 2.5 yuan, the US pound fell by 2 yuan, and the Hong Kong bill and the Canadian bill and Philippine bill each fell by 0.1 yuan. The Singapore bill and the Dutch bill each fell by 0.2 yuan, the Annam bill and the Robi bill each fell by 0.05 yuan, the Japanese gold bill fell slightly by 0.001 yuan, and the Korean bill remained at 1.172 yuan. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>Discount Rate Falls</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for bank drafts and notes fell again. This was because foreign exchange eased, cash fell, and there were few buyers, so cash supply exceeded demand. The rate was still around 70 yuan per 1,000 yuan in the morning, and in the afternoon it fell to 73 yuan, eventually rising back to 75 yuan, down 2.5 yuan from last Saturday. The interest rate for money changers' public association remained at 0.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Greatly Eases</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange rate has risen back to 4.02 yuan, which is the same as the standard exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar. Therefore, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's US dollar exchange rate in this city has increased by 0.0125, reaching 6.25 yuan. The French franc exchange rate has also increased slightly, while other exchange rates such as the British pound exchange rate have remained unchanged. However, the domestic market was not greatly affected because the telegraph exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound on Saturday was not very high. The situation was slightly softened in the morning, but it suddenly eased in the afternoon. This was because Chinese banks and foreign banks were buying, and Chinese merchants were also buying current US dollar exchange rates, so the potential trend was once tight and soft. The British pound was the tightest, reaching 4 pence and 0.375, and the selling price of US dollars at the bank also exceeded 7.3125 yuan. Later, because the Japanese bank suddenly came to sell, the situation stopped tightening and slightly recovered. In the afternoon, rumors of some kind of negative news in the market were rampant, and foreign banks such as Yu Li Bank had a strong desire to sell. Although the Japanese spinning mill came to absorb, the head position was still felt to be in oversupply, so the trend suddenly eased. The hardest British pound had been shouted over 4 pence and 0.53125, and the US dollar had also been called over 7.59375 yuan. However, the result was that it closed at 4 pence and 0.515625 and 7.56225 yuan, with the British pound easing by 0.078125 and the US dollar strengthening by 0.0125 compared to Saturday. The easing trend for October futures was very strong, because interest from many parties faded under the influence of negative news, and the settlement at the end of September had passed, so it was seen that the difference narrowed. The late closing price for the British pound was only 0.046875 apart, and the US dollar was only 0.0125 apart, and the combined monthly interest rate (excluding commission) was slightly less than 0.016, and in reality it was still difficult to obtain. The overall volume of transactions was still strong.</p>
<p>US Dollar Exchange Rate Increases by 0.0125</p>
<p>The initial foreign exchange rates in the morning did not include telegrams from London and the price of US silver. The price of raw gold in London remained stable. The exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar and between the British pound and the French franc was flat, and the exchange rate between the British pound and Shanghai increased by 0.0125. The exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound and between the US dollar and the French franc increased greatly by 0.025, and the exchange rate between the US dollar and Shanghai did not change. The central bank's listed exchange rates for each currency remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was 4 pence and 0.4375 for the British pound and 7.4375 yuan for the US dollar, which was the same as last Saturday. After the opening, Chinese banks and foreign banks came to buy, and Chinese merchants also absorbed the current US dollar exchange rate, so the situation was slightly softened. Chinese banks first closed and bought spot British pounds at 4 pence and 0.40615 and 0.375, and then Chinese merchants and foreign banks also bought and closed the foreign bank's spot US dollar exchange rate at 7.4065 and 0.375. When the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listed prices were announced, the British pound was flat and the US dollar increased by 0.0125, and when the silver equalization tax was announced, there were no changes. After that, Chinese merchants bought the foreign bank's spot US dollars (bills) for 7.125 yuan, and also closed and bought Datong's October US dollar exchange rate at 7.1875 yuan, while the spot US dollar exchange rate of 7.375 yuan was difficult to close. The bank once asked for 7.325 yuan. Then, the Japanese bank's Zhengjin suddenly came to sell, so the situation slightly returned to normal. The Japanese bank sold the spot British pounds at 4 pence and 0.40625 and the spot US dollars at 7.375 yuan to the foreign banks such as Yu Li Bank. Later, the bank's buying price was once 4 pence and 0.421875 and 7.40625 yuan. Until the afternoon, the bank's spot selling price was 4 pence and 0.40625 for the British pound and 7.375 yuan for the US dollar, which was slightly tighter by 0.03125 for the British pound and slightly softer by 0.0625 for the US dollar compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>Foreign Commercial Banks Have a Strong Desire to Sell</p>
<p>In the later market, rumors of some kind of negative news were quite rampant, and foreign banks such as Yu Li Bank had a strong desire to sell, so the market situation greatly eased. The foreign banks sold the spot British pounds at 4 pence and 0.4375 and 0.5 pence to the same banks and the Japanese spinning mill, and the spot US dollars were hardened from 7.4375 yuan to 0.5625 yuan. The hardest British pound had been shouted over 4 pence and 0.53125, and the US dollar had also been called over 7.59375 yuan. Until the evening closing, the bank's spot selling price was 4 pence and 0.515625 for the British pound and 7.56625 yuan for the US dollar, and the October British pound was 4 pence and 0.46875 and the US dollar was 7.4375 yuan. As a result, the spot British pound eased by 0.078125 and the US dollar strengthened by 0.0125 compared to Saturday, and the October British pound increased by 0.01875 and the US dollar cheapened by 0.03125.</p>
<p>September Deposit Interest Rate: Banks and Money Changers All Open at 6 Yuan</p>
<p>The bank's preparation committee yesterday sent a circular to all banks, setting the September draft deposit interest rate at 6 yuan per 1,000 yuan (i.e., a monthly interest rate of 0.06), and the money changers' public association also decided to set the rate at 6 yuan at a regular meeting yesterday, so the two have become consistent.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Debt Takes Advantage of Low Prices, Not Lacking Buyers</h3>
<p>The securities dark market yesterday was still extremely chaotic. Powerful figures in many parties were still able to maintain their positions, but some were slowly emerging, causing the market sentiment to be depressed. However, although the market price was slightly lower, there was no shortage of buyers. Yesterday's situation was that there were many scattered buyers and few sellers. Datong, Dafeng, and Runli all had many buyers emerging or dumping their holdings. The market price fell by a few corners in the morning, and was slightly firmer in the afternoon. The result was a rise or fall of 0.02 to 0.045 yuan. The total volume of transactions was about 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 8.45 yuan per share.</p>
<p>In addition, the Public Stock Exchange reported that the stock market trend yesterday was extremely firm. All of the more reputable stocks were traded vigorously, and almost all of them closed at the highest price of the day. The transaction price of Chinese Business Company stock was 0.04 yuan. Calculated in the same proportion, the current value of its bonds converted into new shares should be 105 taels, but the former does not rise with the latter, which is truly puzzling. The telegraph report on the rubber statistics for August is as follows: 85,000 tons were produced, a decrease of 11,000 tons compared to July; 94,900 tons were consumed, an increase of 9,800 tons compared to July; and the world's reserves were 371,000 tons, a decrease of 24,000 tons compared to the previous month. In general, the statistical position is extremely strong and is still improving. However, the local rubber stocks are slightly different and are being ignored. This is probably because the general public's attention has recently been focused on industrial stocks.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Rebounds, with Coarse and Fine Yarn Rising by 0.1 to 0.2 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which has been shrouded in rumors for days, is now back in the hands of the factories, and market sentiment has been restored. The sales to customers are still flat and weak, which is a bit of a shortcoming. Therefore, the rising trend is still moderate, but 10-count coarse yarn is more stable. This is due to the depletion of inventory, the increasing demand from handicraft weaving factories in the inland Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, and the absorption by Hong Kong, so the market situation is more outstanding than that of fine yarn. Currently, considering the actual transactions in the yarn market, it is flat due to the sluggish demand from all parties, but there is no hope for the price of raw materials to fall, and there are quite a few who are bullish.</p>
<p>The current yarn market opened in the morning due to premature peace predictions, and the popularity was good. The buying momentum in the market was slightly stronger, and 20-count Double Horse warehouse stocks immediately rose by 0.15 to 0.16 yuan, to a price of 7.45 yuan, and the spot price was 7.75 yuan. The price then rose by another 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. Later, due to weak sales to customers, there was a slight decline. At the time of closing, it was still stable. According to the statistics of half-day transactions, 1,265 bales were traded, and the market prices of 20-count Double Horse rose by 0.15 yuan, Double Globe rose by 0.18 yuan, and Tiannv rose by 0.2 yuan. 10-count coarse yarn also rose by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Yong'an Factory opened 260 bales of 10-count Special Golden City at a price of 6.5 yuan. The amount of bales bought by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<h3>Scarce Sources, Cotton Prices Difficult to Relax, Trade Among Peers Still Lively</h3>
<p>Current cotton transactions are still reasonably strong, but the mills' appetite hasn't improved. The advantage lies in trade among peers. Only Rongfeng Mill has made some purchases, while others haven't taken action, so the market remains stable and quiet. Various sources feel particularly difficult to obtain, so sales prices don't relax. Ginned cotton is quoted at 155 to 156 yuan. Rongfeng Mill's purchase of ginned cotton has been of a relatively good grade, with a price of 160 yuan. 380 bales of Tongzhou white wrapped cotton and 500 bales of straw wrapped cotton arrived at the wharf. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Another report: The Shanghai foreign cotton market was active again yesterday. The stock of raw cotton on the market is visibly drying up. Recently, due to a surge in demand for coarse yarn, the price of 10-count Indian "Pingguo'er" cotton jumped by more than 20 yuan. In recent days, 12-count raw cotton has become almost unavailable. Therefore, 42-count cotton yarn rose sharply by 40 to 50 yuan yesterday. However, although the stock of 20-count to 32-count raw cotton in various mills on the market is still sufficient for one or two months, the demand for this type of raw cotton is the most eager. It is expected that the prices of West Indian and Brazilian cotton will skyrocket.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: New York cotton cloth was very calm early in the morning. Cotton prices didn't fluctuate significantly. Later, due to widespread rumors of British and American rejection, speculators took the opportunity to buy, and prices rose accordingly. Trade among peers also became more active. The stock market situation was strong, significantly affecting the cotton market. As a result, the closing price rose by more than ten pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by more than one rupee.</p>
<h3>Grains: Foreign Currency Flows In, Supply Exceeds Demand, Japonica Rice Still Fluctuates</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of goods from various routes totaled more than 4,000 bags of cartwheel packages. Goods from Hexia still haven't arrived. Therefore, at the beginning, the prices in various spot markets tended to stabilize. Later, because the local and rural markets were both sluggish, various spot markets showed supply exceeding demand. Only japonica rice remained a rare commodity and was exceptionally firm. Special common japonica rice was still 43 to 44 yuan, special tin japonica rice was 42 to 43 yuan, medium was 41 yuan, Suzhou and Kun japonica rice was 41 to 40 yuan, Kun and Zhuan new japonica rice was 37 to 38 yuan, Fengjing Baige was 40 to 39.5 yuan, Kun Jia and other new Yangjian special was 26.3 yuan, decisive at 25 yuan, special Lujian was 26.5 yuan, decisive at 25.5 yuan, Sichuan Jian was 25 to 24 yuan, Jiangbei Jian was 20.78 to 22.5 yuan, Wuhu Jian was 23.2 to 22.5 yuan, hard Jian was 21.5 to 21 yuan, Bian Yuan was stable at 34 to 35 yuan. The total transaction volume was 5,600 to 5,700 bags.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, there were still 4,000 to 5,000 bags arriving from various routes. Sources from Jiangbei and other places have become smooth. Moreover, Hubei Province had a bumper autumn harvest this year, and a whole batch of brown rice has come to Shanghai. Market sentiment is becoming softer. Although local merchants and domestic suppliers still have social obligations, the market still sees a slight decrease of half a yuan. 1,000 bags of newly arrived Hankou brown rice were quoted at only 19 yuan. Nanjing brown rice was also only 19.5 to 19.6 yuan. High-quality Jiangbei Wuhu indica rice was also only 23 yuan, and medium quality was only 21 to 22 yuan. If the supply continues to arrive in an endless stream, the sales price may decrease again.</p>
<h3>Flour Mills Urge Delivery of Orders, Stockpilers Return Goods, Japanese Mills Also Resell Futures Flour</h3>
<p>The current flour mill situation hasn't changed. It's still holding at the 7-yuan mark. Returned goods don't have significant price fluctuations. However, due to the mills' strict urging of delivery and the issue of increased storage rent after the expiration of the contract, some speculators continue to release goods, with prices ranging from 6.9 to 6.95 yuan. The market can still stand firm. As for Japanese mills' futures flour, there are many sellers in the market. This is all because of the atmosphere of peace, which has led speculators outside the industry to seek to get out. The price for October is only 6.85 to 6.8 yuan, a sharp drop of 2 to 3 yuan compared to last weekend. 20,000 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin on the second, and 7,300 bags on the third.</p>
<p>The source of wheat isn't abundant. Arrivals in the past two days totaled about 20,000 bags. Because there have been many rumors recently, suppliers have mixed feelings, and mills are watching and waiting. Stockpilers are all planning to choose cleverly and take advantage. The market feels quite lonely. Unified market purchases have been suspended. Only stockpilers have slightly purchased a total of four or five cars from Chuzhou, Nanjing, Wuyi, and other places, with prices ranging from 9.9 to 9.65 yuan. The market is similar to the previous week.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Market Prices Lower Than Mill Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Guangdong merchants and local retail sales of domestic cloth continued to be smooth. Cotton yarn rebounded. Current market prices are lower than mill prices. Market sentiment is stable, so the quoted prices for various cloths have risen instead of falling. White goods and coarse cloth are the firmest at 13 pounds and 10 pounds. Products from mills such as Ewo and New Ewo have increased by 2.5 jiao per bolt. Ewo 11 coarse cloth has also increased by 5 fen to 1 jiao. Medium and low-grade fine cloth has increased by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao. Fine twill has increased by 2.5 jiao to 5 jiao. Bleached and dyed cloth has increased by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao. Line flannel, broadcloth, and velvet have increased by 1.5 jiao to 4.5 jiao. Local transactions include more than 400 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, gray cloth, and coarse cloth, and nearly 10,000 bolts of bleached and dyed printed cloth and velvet. Guangdong merchants purchased more than 10,000 bolts of colored cloth, colored twill, line flannel, satin, and colored satin. Zhejiang and Fujian merchants purchased more than 200 boxes of colored cloth, colored twill, printed velvet, coarse cloth, and patterned goods. Yesterday, 205 pieces of cloth were shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<p>East Piece Goods</p>
<p>White fine cloth and fine twill continued to be in strong demand due to the local demand for dyed gray cloth, with 800 to 900 pieces traded. Low-grade fine twill is firm, increasing by another 4 to 5 jiao per bolt. High-grade fine cloth is stable. 12-pound Dragon Head still sells for 23 yuan per bolt. However, the market is quite tight. Futures for this month have already opened at 24 yuan. Wufu fine cloth is 22.5 yuan, Trumpet is 22.25 yuan, with 200 pieces ordered. Four Gentlemen broadcloth has risen again to 7.25 fen per yard, straight tribute is 7.3 fen. Market sentiment is particularly high.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Speculative Activities, Soybean Oil Rises Sharply After Falling</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean oil market situation: Early in the morning, it still followed the soft trend of last weekend, opening down 4 jiao. Later, because market sentiment was influenced by rumors, local buyers launched a buying spree, causing stockpilers to eagerly push up prices. In the afternoon, it was completely controlled by manipulators. As a result, it rose by 2 yuan compared to the opening price. Statistics show that 20 barrels of Dalian oil were traded (prices are detailed in the market price column), 100 barrels of Kobe oil, 50 pieces of Yantai oil, 100 pieces of Qingqi oil, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 20 barrels of Tianjin barrel oil, and 39 barrels of Qingdao barrel oil. It was found that 380 bags of soybeans were shipped to Tianjin today.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Qilijing Silk Opens at 2,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Local silk market: Qilijing silk exports have become active again. Dachang and Xinfu jointly purchased 210 loads. Kirin, Racing Horse, Green Dragon, and White Horse grades sold well, with silk prices opening at 2,000 yuan, an increase of 50 yuan compared to last week. Therefore, white filature silk trading will also be stimulated. It is a fact that there is not much Qilijing silk in the mainland. However, a large part of the raw materials for white filature silk are still shelved in Hongkou, and the autumn cocoon situation is not good. The output of white filature this year and market sales will be even more acute. Therefore, it is predicted that the current trend of the local silk market will continue to remain high. Yesterday, New York had no market, and Yokohama fluctuated slightly. Spot was 1,610 yuan, with no fluctuation. Near term was 1,576 yuan, and deferred was 1,530 yuan, with only a fluctuation of about 5 yuan. Therefore, the foreign silk market is still in a flat state.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign sugar didn't fluctuate much. The guild's price for No. 24 coarse white spot goods at this warehouse increased by half a yuan to 55.5 yuan. Goods from foreign warehouses also reached 55.5 yuan at the beginning of the market, then softened, reaching 54.8 jiao. Transit was still 42 yuan. Taikoo's cart white didn't fluctuate. B mark was 59 yuan, CW mark was 58.5 yuan, CX mark was 58 yuan, DY mark was 57.5 yuan, HX mark was 57 yuan. Cart red and Dutch red were both at the original price. Transit Dutch red was reported to be lacking. Local cotton white increased by another 5 jiao. Zhenji No. 1 was 56.5 yuan, Nos. 2, 3, and 4 were discounted as before. Local crystal sugar was also tight, with the same increase. No. 1 was 67 yuan, and Jingming crystal sugar was 68.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: New Dates and Walnuts Offered, Black Fungus Tightens, Chinese Olive Arrives Sparsely</h3>
<p>New dates: The local dealers' own goods have arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, the market sold them for 90 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>New walnuts: More than ten packages recently arrived. Haozhou walnuts opened at 60 yuan, and southern walnuts at 50 yuan. Because the initial supply is small, prices are relatively high.</p>
<p>Black fungus: The market has tightened slightly recently. Hankou miscellaneous fungus opened at 277 yuan in cash. Ordinary Sichuan fungus opened at 285 yuan yesterday. High-quality remittance transfers couldn't be accommodated, and still needed about 300 yuan.</p>
<p>New Chinese olives: There have been continued arrivals recently, but only about 200 boxes. The market trend shows signs of continuing to rise.</p>
<p>Seafood: New Western Sea Cucumber, Second Batch Already Sold</p>
<p>Western sea cucumber: Since the new goods came on the market, the second batch has already been sold, and the trend is still firm and high. However, the Longya was the first batch to arrive, with the opening price nearly double that of last year. The prices of various grades of goods are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Longya selected strips jade 287 yuan, outgoing purchase 267 yuan, No. 1 251 yuan, No. 2 237 yuan, No. 3 212 yuan, No. 4 197 yuan, medium jade 186 yuan, large medium jade 166 yuan, small jade 131 yuan, Xianda Port selected strips jade 214 yuan, outgoing purchase 211 yuan, No. 1 208 yuan, deputy No. 1 203 yuan, large No. 2 194 yuan, positive No. 2 184 yuan, No. 3 168 yuan, No. 4 156 yuan, agarwood selected strips jade 282 yuan, outgoing purchase 263 yuan, No. 1 246 yuan, large No. 2 230 yuan, positive No. 2 218 yuan, No. 3 204 yuan, No. 4 197 yuan, No. 5 183 yuan, medium jade 159 yuan, Makassar large jade 200 yuan, No. 1 188 yuan, No. 2 185 yuan, No. 3 177 yuan, No. 4 166 yuan.</p>
<p>Metals: Antimony, Over 6,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Hunan pure antimony (commonly known as "Antimony"): Recently, due to the small amount of goods arriving and the insufficient stock in Shanghai, and the actual sales are still good, local peers have a very firm sentiment, and prices have risen frequently. In one day, the price increased by 800 yuan and 1,000 yuan. It was found that the price of the goods was only about 3,500 yuan a month ago. Since the outbreak of the European War, the opening price has been rising day by day. Recently, it has risen to over 6,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Health Forum</p>
<h3>Sexual Hygiene: The Most Sound Marriage</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of Russian Labor Medical School</p>
<p>Dominated by Superior Reproductive Power</p>
<p>As a result of human evolution, the history of marriage has transformed into a new and strange face. The system has evolved from polygamy and polyandry to monogamy. The mode of union has also evolved from plunder, buying and selling, and agency to contract. The world is moving in a turbulent and chaotic direction, and all marriages also show a symbol of wandering and unease. In the great era of the twentieth century, other revolutions may be said to have achieved success, but the future of marriage is still bleak!</p>
<p>What is the reason for this? In a word, this is entirely because people do not understand the importance of health, the greatest main force of love. German physiologist Stoltz-Strass said: "A sound marriage is entirely based on sound energy." Marriage is about seeking the satisfaction of love and desire, and this love and desire is also the medium for the continuation of offspring, which is undoubtedly true.</p>
<p>The six meanings of a sound marriage are that each person's body and mind are fully and continuously developing. The protagonist of a bad marriage includes a broken mind on one side and a weak body, and is the destroyer of a sound marriage. Eugenists believe that the main reason for the creation of bad marriages is that love is not focused and realistic. Unlimited pursuit of love is most likely to damage physiology, such as early marriage, polygamy, premarital self-pollution, and postmarital indulgence, all of which cause the function of reproduction to decline, the function of metabolism to slow down, and the brain and kidneys lose the guarantee of prosperity. Hundreds of diseases arise, premature aging, spermatorrhea, impotence, premature ejaculation, neurasthenia, back pain, forgetfulness, and insomnia gradually form. Such people either die young or are always accompanied by medicine. Isn't it heartbreaking!</p>
<p>Speaking as a doctor, the treatment of this kind of disease can only be actively taken with the old German brand of testicular essence preparation for men and women, "Boti Kang", to have hope of rejuvenation, but on the one hand, it should also strictly observe health, and at the same time, it should avoid mistakenly purchasing similar counterfeit drugs. Although there are preparations with the same ingredients on the market that call on patients, most of them are aphrodisiacs in disguise, or supplements similar to aphrodisiacs. Only the "Boti Kang" drug is a truly potent animal testicular essence supplement, and it also contains brain-supplementing phosphorus. The female version is a pure ovarian endocrine preparation, which has the functions of regulating menstruation and seeds and treating anemia and premature aging.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>If a Couple Has Gonorrhea, They Should Both Be Treated</h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>The suffering of gonorrhea can only be known by those who suffer from it, and it cannot be described in writing. However, general old gonorrhea sufferers, because their treatment has been ineffective for a long time, cannot help but be disappointed with general drugs. Therefore, many give up hope of treatment, and because they cannot bear long-term abstinence, they inevitably engage in sexual behavior with their wives. Therefore, history causes them to infect their wives. Therefore, if a wife is infected by someone with gonorrhea, the white discharge from the lower part suddenly increases, the vagina is eroded, and it further threatens her reproductive function. If the patient is not yet married, it is best to cure it completely before marriage. Otherwise, even if the husband has been cured, the wife is still poisonous. Then the husband's gonorrhea is as good as not being cured. In other words, if a married man is treated for gonorrhea until he is completely cured, it is inevitable that he will waste all his previous efforts after sleeping with his wife who is infected with gonorrhea. Repeated infection.</p>
<p>Now that the urgent need for safe treatment for gonorrhea patients has been clearly explained, the remaining question is how to make effective treatment. Regarding this issue, there is now a satisfactory solution. Because in terms of internal medicine, the German Dr. Peter has invented the gonorrhea special medicine "Ke Lin Nong". This medicine is made according to the latest non-specific therapy, using a mixture of protein and pigments. After experiments by experts in venereal disease hospitals in various countries, the results show that taking "Ke Lin Nong" produces anti-gonococcal phage effects within a few hours. It has anti-inflammatory, diuretic, analgesic, and clear lymphatic effects in the early stages of gonorrhea. Chronic gonorrhea can also completely eliminate the gonorrhea bacteria deeply hidden in various places, and thus all changes will also be effective. As for those unfortunate wives who also have gonorrhea, they can also take "Ke Lin Nong", and use "Ka Er Xuedi vaginal tablets" for external use as a suppository, which is easy to succeed.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Symposium</p>
<h3>Points That Should Be Paid Special Attention To</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>The points that should be paid attention to in the radical cure of gonorrhea and turbidity are whether the patient chooses a doctor and medicine carefully and cautiously, or casually. If someone suffers from gonorrhea, if they can be treated properly, then the so-called stubborn gonorrhea that cannot be eradicated is actually a deceptive statement. However, if they do not follow scientific methods of treatment, or do not observe health, it often becomes a difficult disease to treat, which is a point that must be paid special attention to. Only because most gonorrhea patients encounter this situation for the first time, and most have no medical knowledge, so they often suffer a lot, and they cannot help but abuse the general over-the-counter drugs on the market that are rich in side effects in order to seek temporary pain relief. How can they know that most of these analgesic drugs contain a kind of anesthetic ingredient. Readers must know that the painful phenomenon of our initial infection with gonorrhea is a kind of natural physiological reaction, and it cannot be effective with anesthesia. Moreover, most anesthetic products have the effect of reducing the patient's original resistance, this is one. Another is that patients are affected by environmental factors and still勉强 support their usual work. They should know that the first health condition for gonorrhea is quietness. Now they are doing the opposite, so how can it not be harmful to the sick body? Therefore, the reason why the gonorrhea I have cured over the years is faster than others is that the patients, in addition to listening to my treatment, also accept the health methods I have instructed. As for the treatment method, among internal medicines, the gonorrhea holy medicine "Ke Lin Nong" is the best, because the bactericidal effect of "Ke Lin Nong" can directly reach the lesion, surround the gonorrhea bacteria and destroy it. On the one hand, German static electricity therapy is used to make the gonorrhea bacteria attached to the front and rear urethra also get static electricity and have no place to stand. Therefore, in acute gonorrhea, this method is used because of the thoroughness of the sterilization power, and there is no way to leak the net, so it is treated quickly, and the use of this method for chronic gonorrhea can fundamentally solve the problem and never recur. During the consultation, from 10 am to 6 pm, a consultation is sent every day on the 20th. Each number only takes a number fee of 5 jiao, and a copy of "The Complete Book of Sexually Transmitted Diseases" worth 1 yuan is given away.</p>
<h3>Usually Less Self-Pollution, More Happiness After Marriage</h3>
<p>— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting</p>
<p>Almost every young person in the world is envious of marriage, because marriage is happy; beautiful; sweet, but, dear readers? I want to tell you, in fact, it is not that simple. Anyway, many young people feel annoyed, painful, and even commit suicide because of marriage. What is the reason for this? Because marriage has certain guarantees, that is, a healthy body and abundant energy. If young people lose these two guarantees, even if the marriage is established, it will inevitably go bankrupt. Therefore, young people with self-pollution habits should start from today to actively abstain, so that there will be more guarantees of happiness after marriage, but if there are those who suffer from spermatorrhea, brain weakness, insomnia, forgetfulness, and all kinds of divine red weakness due to self-pollution, please also engage in treatment, I am more and more trapped, and premature ejaculation often occurs after marriage, so treatment should be started early. Regarding the most effective treatment, nothing is better than taking "Nai Er Si Spermatorrhea Tablets". This medicine has the effect of stopping spermatorrhea on the same night, and the effect is lasting and never relapses. In addition, if there are those who have been injured due to self-pollution, they should immediately take the German testicular essence preparation for men "Boti Kang" to make up for the losses.</p>
<h3>How to Treat Consumption?</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Coughing before consumption is a precursor to formation. Therefore, coughing has a great relationship with the health of our lungs. Therefore, it is necessary to cure the symptom of coughing in order to ensure the avoidance of lung disease first. However, coughing is not as difficult to treat as most people imagine. In today's era of flourishing medicine, when the tubercle bacillus has frequently reached the end of its life, coughing has indeed been successfully and quickly cured. No matter whether it is a cough due to influenza or a cough due to catarrh of the lungs, you can take the lung disease holy medicine "Bu Fei Na Er", which can relieve cough and resolve phlegm within three hours, and is incredibly effective. Therefore, its efficacy is the first choice among lung disease medicines.</p>

<h3>British Yangtze River Fleet Decides to Withdraw Five Ships, Deploying Them to Meet Military Needs Elsewhere, Ships Patrolling in the Xiang River Area Continue as Usual</h3>
<p>Reuters, Shanghai: The British government, in view of urgent military needs elsewhere, has decided to withdraw five of the ten British gunboats stationed in the Yangtze River. This arrangement will enable many trained soldiers to serve more beneficially in actual combat. The establishment of this decision recognizes that when military demands elsewhere are more important, the current situation on the Yangtze River does not require the stationing of ten gunboats between Shanghai and Hankou.</p>
<p>Associated Press, this port, 2nd: The British naval authorities here announced today, "Due to urgent military needs elsewhere," five of the ten British gunboats anchored in the Yangtze River have been withdrawn. The announcement stated, "The British government, in view of urgent military needs elsewhere, has decided to withdraw five of the ten gunboats anchored in the Yangtze River. As a result, a large number of trained officers and soldiers can be placed in active service where they are more useful. The reason why the government made this decision is because the government feels that when there is an urgent need for military affairs elsewhere, there is no need to retain ten gunboats between Shanghai and Hankou on the Yangtze River."</p>
<p>Xiang River Gunboats Continue to Be Stationed</p>
<p>The English-language "Demei Evening Post" said that the British Embassy officially announced this morning (2nd) that five of the British Yangtze River defense gunboats will be withdrawn so that officers and soldiers can serve in active service in other places. It is understood that this only refers to the gunboats in the Yangtze River that are now under Japanese control. The British Yangtze River defense gunboats in the Yangtze River (or northern Hunan and Dongting Lake) in "free China" are not within the scope of this order.</p>
<p>British Embassy Announcement Original Text</p>
<p>The announcement announced by the British Embassy is as follows: "The British government, in view of the urgent military needs elsewhere, has decided to withdraw five of the ten British gunboats from the Yangtze River. This move will enable a large number of skilled officers and soldiers to serve more useful active service. The British government made this decision because it believed that when military needs elsewhere are more urgent, the current situation on the Yangtze River does not require the retention of ten gunboats between Shanghai and Hankou."</p>
<p>Current Anchoring Locations of British Ships on the Yangtze River</p>
<p>According to reports, the British gunboats currently anchored in Shanghai include the Scorpion, Dragonfly, Grasshopper, Aphid, and Ladybug. It has not been announced that these gunboats will be withdrawn. Other British ships in the Yangtze River between Shanghai and Hankou include the Gold Bug, Mantis, Jiao, Gull, and Petrel. Those in "free China" include the Tang'e (anchored in Yichang), Eagle (anchored in Changsha), and Waterbird (anchored in Chongqing).</p>
<h3>Requesting Exemption from Foreign Exchange Settlement for Native Products Transshipped from Ningbo to Shanghai; Ningbo Merchants Establish a Shipping Company</h3>
<p>Shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo: Since Reiss &amp; Co.'s Moufu steamboat first created the opportunity to stay outside the Zhenhai estuary to wait for unloading, it returned to Shanghai to carry passengers to Zhen, because passengers can be loaded and unloaded in Zhen as soon as they arrive, but goods must be sent to anchor for transfer according to the order of arrival. However, it was not actually implemented, so at present, passenger traffic between Shanghai and Ningbo is extremely congested.</p>
<p>Increased Passengers</p>
<p>When the Deping steamboat sailed to Zhen on the 30th, it felt very crowded with passengers, and some passengers did not have time to buy tickets and boarded the ship without permission, causing late-arriving ticket-purchasing passengers to be rejected on the shore. It is learned that these passengers were arranged by Zhongyi Company to change their tickets to China Steam Navigation Company's Dapu steamboat, which has been scheduled to sail to Zhen on the 4th to join the Shanghai-Ningbo route. Also, Reiss &amp; Co.'s Haifu steamboat has been scheduled to sail to Zhen at 4 am on the 3rd, and it is also very crowded with passengers.</p>
<p>Limited Foreign Exchange Settlement</p>
<p>Since the Ningbo Zhejiang Customs received instructions from the Ministry of Finance, native products transshipped from Ningbo to Shanghai, no matter what kind of goods, have been required to purchase and settle foreign exchange since the 20th of last month. However, the goods loaded on the Deping and Moufu steamboats in mid-last month were returned to the customs due to wind and waves. The batch of goods has been requested to be allowed to be exported. Also, various industries in Ningbo are telegraphing the Ministry of Finance for relief regarding the foreign exchange settlement of native goods, so as not to block the export of native products. However, no reply has been received yet. The volume of goods transported from Ningbo to Shanghai has been sharply reduced in recent days.</p>
<p>Shipping Company</p>
<p>The Ningbo shipping industry, in view of the gradual increase in the number of Shanghai-Ningbo steamboats, believes that it is necessary to comprehensively adjust the shipping vessels. It has initiated the organization of a shipping company, which has now been formally established with a capital of 50,000 yuan. Zhou Dalie, chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, and shipping merchant Zhu Meixian have all participated, so the internal organization is very sound. It is expected that the supply of lighters will increase, which will be of great benefit to travelers.</p>

<h3>Two Instances of Damage to the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Confirmed by Japanese Sources; Denial of Casualties</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, a Japanese military spokesman issued a statement last night (the 1st) regarding the recent incidents on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, claiming that on the morning of September 12th, at 9:40 AM, a section of the railway line between Xinfeng in Dongfu and Zazhe was blown up. However, the damage was minor, with only one side of the rail slightly damaged. Repairs were completed by 11:58 AM, and railway operations to Nanjing were not disrupted. The second incident occurred at 8:30 PM on September 28th, when a mine exploded near a railway bridge between Henglin and Qishuyan. A mixed freight and passenger train was passing by at the time, and some carriages derailed, with the engine and four or five freight cars falling into the river. However, there were no casualties. The damaged railway was repaired on the same night. During the repairs, passengers walked across the bridge and transferred to another train on the other side, so traffic between Shanghai and Nanjing was not interrupted. In both incidents, there were no casualties.</p>
<h3>Increased Security in Western Shanghai; Migration Trend Intensifies; Shanghai Municipal Council Continues Negotiations; Puppet Municipal Government Imposes Illegal Business Tax Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries of the Shanghai International Settlement in western Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Council has been negotiating with the Japanese puppet regime to find a solution. However, with the support of the Japanese, the puppet regime's actions infringing upon rights are escalating. Ragtag troops are conducting widespread activities. The Settlement Police are unable to exercise police authority, and the puppet "Finance Bureau" has also independently established tax regulations and begun collecting business taxes yesterday. Local residents are trapped under dual pressure, facing a dilemma. Therefore, families with some means are choosing to relocate. As a result, the trend of moving is intensifying. To prevent disturbances on the border, the Settlement authorities have mobilized the armored car units of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to patrol the border area. The following are various news items:</p>
<p>Negotiations Still in Progress</p>
<p>At a reception for Western reporters yesterday, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy revealed that the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, and the puppet "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an are currently negotiating over the issues of road construction beyond the boundaries and taxation. When a reporter asked what action the Japanese side would take if residents refused to pay taxes to the puppet regime, the Japanese Embassy spokesman said, "We have not considered that yet."</p>
<p>Situation Tense in Western Shanghai Area</p>
<p>The authorities of the two settlements in this port have recently intensified their defense measures. The armored car units of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps have almost all been deployed to defend the western border of Shanghai. Red patrol cars of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department are taking turns searching pedestrians and vehicles at all traffic entrances and exits within the settlement. Yesterday, Indian mounted police were seen patrolling the area of Caoyang Road in the road construction area beyond the border in western Shanghai. Puppet police were still stationed in front of Zhaofeng Park. The puppet police's preparedness at the Difeng Road intersection was stricter than before yesterday. Five people lined up in three rows at the four corners of the intersection, checking passing pedestrians and vehicles. The situation at No. 121 Bailinan Road remained the same as the day before, with unarmed puppet police on guard.</p>
<p>Puppet Regime Implements Business Tax Collection</p>
<p>After the puppet "Finance Bureau" announced that it would implement the collection of house tax and business tax in the area of road construction beyond the boundaries on October 1st, due to the strong opposition from residents and businesses, the house tax was not levied yesterday. The puppet "Finance Bureau" also changed the business tax rates of 10%, 20%, and 30% to 1%, 2%, and 3% due to the opposition from various businesses, and began collecting yesterday. A general tax of 1% or 2% is levied on daily necessities, while a tax of 3% is levied on luxury goods. Small business owners, unable to resist, are all complaining bitterly.</p>
<p>Rumors of Forced Vaccination</p>
<p>After being instigated by a certain party, the puppet "Municipal Government" ordered the "Police Brigade" of puppet police to invade the section of road construction beyond the boundaries and occupy the positions on various roads. In recent days, puppet troops have also had armed patrol cars patrolling the roads, causing the situation in the western district to appear tense. At the same time, the puppet "Finance Bureau" also decided to forcibly collect winter taxes starting on the 1st of this month. As a result, the general residents all felt a major threat. Yesterday, it was rumored that after the Japanese forcibly collect house tax in the western district of Shanghai, they also intend to imitate the method used in District A of North Henan Road and force residents to undergo vaccination. Upon hearing this news, the residents became even more uneasy.</p>
<p>Majority of Residents Moving Out</p>
<p>The residents of various lanes on Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai have felt uneasy since the puppet police invaded. Quite a few people have moved out. After the puppet regime announced the forced collection of house tax and rumored forced vaccination, the residents became even more panic-stricken. Therefore, starting yesterday, the trend of migration has become even more widespread.</p>
<p>Chinese Face the Most Suffering</p>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, a Shanghai Municipal Council official expressed his views this morning (the 2nd) on the recent developments between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Shanghai Grand Avenue authorities, saying that unless the authorities involved in the various disputes in the area can reach a mutual understanding, the various incidents will pose insurmountable difficulties for the residents of the roads outside the boundary. It is not impossible for both the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Grand Avenue authorities to notify the residents of the area to pay taxes. In fact, this is the result of the current situation. Residents of the area outside the boundary who are currently paying taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council have recently received notices from the Grand Avenue authorities to pay taxes. This matter must be resolved through negotiation. There is no other method that can be adopted for the time being. Those who are most affected by the recent developments are mostly Chinese. Unless both parties reach a compromise, it will be difficult for these Chinese to cope with this. Foreign residents in the area have already requested assistance from their consulates.</p>
<h3>Local Goods Industry Expresses Solemn Position on Controlled Vegetables; Taking Reducing the Burden on Citizens as a Principle; Paying Close Attention to Future Developments</h3>
<p>The Japanese puppet regime's plan to control the vegetables in the two concessions may soon be implemented. The following is the actual situation obtained from various sources:</p>
<p>Japanese Organizations Support This Move</p>
<p>It is the consistent policy of the Japanese puppet regime to control the main food supplies in the two concessions. Fresh meat and fish have already been placed under the control of the "Livestock Market" and "Fish Market." The control of vegetables was launched in the spring of this year, but it was not implemented due to the firm opposition from the local goods industry and other parties. In mid-August, there were repeated incidents of intercepting vegetable vendors in Pudong and transporting the vegetables to the Hongkou market, which was suspended due to criticism from public opinion and internal conflicts. Now, the old matter is being brought up again, and the Sixing Warehouse at the new garbage bridge is selected as the "Vegetable Market" in order to realize control. It is said that it has obtained the consent of the "Asia Development Board" and the Japanese Navy.</p>
<p>Sixing Warehouse Undergoing Major Repairs</p>
<p>According to a reporter's investigation, the goods and all items stored in the Sixing Warehouse have been gradually moved out. Because the warehouse underwent a bloody battle during the isolated army's defense, the outer walls are full of bullet marks, and the interior is also mostly damaged. Therefore, it is planned to carry out major repairs for application. This project will begin soon, and it is planned to build a new house next to the warehouse to supplement the shortage. It is also heard that markets will be set up separately on Hongqiao Road or Bailinan Road and at the Sixteenth Concession to control the transportation and sale of vegetables in western Shanghai and Pudong.</p>
<p>Local Goods Industry Has a Solemn Attitude</p>
<p>According to a Mr. So-and-so from the local goods industry, the price of vegetables in the concessions has made it unbearable for the citizens. The industry should adopt the principle of reducing the burden on the citizens and eliminating the damage caused by vegetable vendors and carpetbaggers, and should carefully and solemnly deal with this future crisis. Once control is implemented, if the local goods firms do not cooperate, the so-called vegetable market will not be able to operate. Therefore, it is necessary to take the interests of the citizens as the premise and go all out. As the water fruit industry has always been closely connected with the local goods industry, if vegetables are controlled, fruits will of course be included.</p>
<p>French Police Search Anle Palace Hotel</p>
<p>At around 9 PM last night, the French police ordered Chinese and Western detectives to go to the Anle Palace Hotel on Edward VII Avenue to conduct a large-scale search, which lasted for half an hour. As a result, nothing was found.</p>

<h3>Japan Builds Railway in Zhenru; Muslim Cemetery Faces Disaster; Attempts to Occupy the Land to Build a Road Directly to Baoshan; Officials Sent to Decisively Notify the Removal of Graves</h3>
<p>According to Da Guang News Agency, the Muslim cemetery and Cattle Industry Association in Zhenru, a suburb of Shanghai, occupy more than ten acres of land and are not far from Zhenru Railway Station. Before the war in Shanghai, Muslims held a public memorial service every spring. After the Chinese army moved west and the area fell, it became an important area for Japanese military train transportation. The issue of Muslim cemetery worship has long been a problem. Only a few people are left there to guard the cemetery. Today, the Japanese side wants to occupy the land to build a railway directly to Baoshan. Officials were sent to decisively notify the removal of graves. The cemetery guards, whose duty is concerned, have already reported the information to the Muslim Church on Fuyou Road, the competent authority.</p>
<p>Public Outrage; Gathering to Discuss Response</p>
<p>Upon hearing this news, the church immediately notified all Muslim groups in Shanghai. Upon learning this news, the Muslims were extremely indignant. They believed that the Japanese move was purely intended to destroy the historical sites of Chinese religions. According to the spokesman of the Muslim church to the Da Guang News Agency reporter, there are more than ten churches in the Muslim community in Shanghai, and there are even more Muslim restaurants and noodle shops. The Zhenru Muslim Cemetery and the Qingzhen Villa on Xujiahui Road both have a long history. Today, the Japanese side has blatantly done this. We can only temporarily endure it, and we will hold a board meeting tomorrow afternoon to discuss the aftermath. The removal of the tomb will be decided at the meeting.</p>
<p>Notice to Cemetery Relatives; Solicit Opinions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Muslim Church (currently located at Qingzhen Villa on Xujiahui Road) issued an emergency notice yesterday, stating that it has been reported that the Zhenru Muslim Cemetery may be built into a railway. This matter concerns the public cemetery of our religion. It is specifically scheduled to discuss the matter at 7 PM on the 4th of this month (Wednesday). Those who have tombs there are welcome to submit their opinions for discussion. This announcement.</p>
<h3>Coal Balls Drop in Price; Coal Ball Association Stipulates; Reduction of Two Yuan per Ton</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Ball Industry Association held a joint meeting of various factories at its association on Tianjin Road at 3 PM yesterday. More than ten representatives from various factories, including Yuan Wenqing and Li Youhua, attended. Chairman Chen Cuifang recorded Zhang Yizhi. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, and then began to discuss one item. The chairman submitted a proposal, stating that the joint meeting of various factories on September 2nd decided that the selling price of coal balls was 67 yuan per ton and 3.7 yuan per load. However, as the prices of all commodities increased and the market was chaotic, the Appraisal Committee on September 14th determined that the selling price was 76 yuan per ton, and 4.2 yuan per load, which has been maintained until now and is considered fair. Now, it is found that the coal market has loosened somewhat, and the price of raw coal dust has fallen by 2 yuan per ton. The market price of coal balls also seems to need to be changed appropriately. How should this be handled? Please make a public decision on the case. It was resolved that from October 1st, the factory coal ball bills of lading, wholesale, should be priced at 74 yuan per ton, and retail at 4 yuan per load. The warehouse rent and truck labor are still handled according to the resolution of September 23rd. (That is, the warehouse rent of each factory is exempt for ten days from the date of wholesale. After the expiration, 5 jiao should be paid for every ten days. If it expires for one day, it will also be counted as ten days. The truck labor for trucks is uniformly 2.4 yuan per ton.)</p>
<h3>Famous Chinese and Western Doctors Establish a Consultation Clinic</h3>
<p>It has recently been heard that Dr. Ranna from Austria, Dr. Mei Zhuosheng, who studied in the United States, and Dr. Zhu Weiju, a Chinese medicine practitioner, have jointly established a consultation clinic. Each patient will be jointly diagnosed and treated. Based on their past achievements in cooperation, they will seek the greatest possible safety in the protection of patients' lives. This kind of organization is a pioneering effort in the medical field. The address will be located at Nos. 103-104 Sassoon House, Nanjing Road.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Rice Industry Groups; Revised Market Trading Rules; Rectification of Dispute Resolution Committee; Resolved to Implement from the 16th of This Month</h3>
<p>The Bean and Rice Industry Association, Rice Store Association, Rice Milling Industry Association, Rice Sales Industry Association, and the Changshu Rice Industry Association, Nanbang Rice Industry Association, and Shanghai Northbound Rice Merchant Union of this city held a joint meeting at 3 PM yesterday on the second floor of the Grain, Oil Cake Exchange at No. 15 Edward VII Avenue.

Xing Zhigang was elected as the temporary chairman. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, and then began to discuss the revision of the market trading rules. After detailed research by the representatives, they all revised and passed them item by item, and decided to implement them from October 16th. The Market Mediation Committee has also been reorganized to handle market disputes.</p>

<p>Management Committee Report</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Merchant Tea Party Market Management Committee has revised the "Market Trading Rules" through a joint meeting of representatives of the seven rice industry groups. In order to make the market representatives of each store and customer aware of the rules, in addition to posting a notice on a regular basis, the committee will convene a meeting of representatives of each store and customer at 11 AM today. At that time, Chairman Fu Qiangeng will report on the revision process of the "Market Trading Rules" and the transactions that each store and customer should abide by thereafter, and there should be no out-of-bounds actions to maintain market order and avoid disputes. The Xinsheng News Agency reporter inquired about the future food supply for Shanghai citizens from the leaders of various rice industries, or it will decline, because each rice-producing area has decided to dredge the source. Yesterday, two or three ships came from Hebu, and the carriage wheel buns were loaded with 6,000 buns. Because the transaction in this street was light and people's hearts were weak, the rice price fell back. A total of 4,500 buns were traded in the morning.</p>
<h3>Food Supply for Refugees in Nanshi Adjusted; More Than 4,000 Residents; Three Shelters Established</h3>
<p>The adjustment of the food supply for refugees in Nanshi has been completed since the 1st of this month. The reliable news obtained is as follows:</p>
<p>More Than 4,000 People Separately Sheltered</p>
<p>There are currently 19,209 refugees in Nanshi, with 88 shelters established. Each person is given 6 liang of rice per day. There are also 19,700 residents in the area who also enjoy the same food supply as the refugees. Since the 13th of last month, half of the food has been issued, and registration and adjustment have been carried out at the same time. It is now known that from the 1st of this month, the issuance of rice to these residents has been completely stopped. After careful investigation, it was found that about 4,700 of them are completely unable to maintain a minimum standard of living, and three shelters have been set up separately to enjoy the same treatment as refugees.</p>
<p>New Shelters Slightly Different in Organization</p>
<p>The 88 refugee shelters in Nanshi were managed by the head office in eight districts, but these three newly added shelters are directly under the head office, so the organization is slightly different. However, in terms of management and content, it is completely the same as the existing 88 shelters. It is also known that the locations of the three shelters are: (1) Changsheng Street, (2) Old Site of the Flour Exchange on Minguo Road, (3) Seaman's Guild on Wutong Street.</p>
<p>Saving Expenses; Improving Life</p>
<p>After this adjustment, the expenses of the refugee area in Nanshi can save the food supply for 15,000 people. If the economy is generous, the surplus can be used to improve the lives of refugees. As for the 15,000 residents in the area who have been eliminated, it is known that they are indeed able to support themselves. However, this nearly 10,000 refugees cannot be repatriated for a while, or the problem of finding a job for them cannot be solved.</p>
<h3>Japanese Puppet Troops Withdraw from the North District Vaccination Site; Shanghai Municipal Council Police Sent to Replace Them; Japanese Will Still Investigate Households</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese side forcibly implemented vaccination in District A of the area from North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road in the north of Suzhou River, the original deadline was the 30th of last month. However, because there were still many people who refused to be vaccinated, the Japanese side announced an extension of one week, changing the deadline to the 10th of this month. Therefore, the tent vaccination site on North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road is still continuing its work today. In the past few days, due to the large number of people, it was inevitable to be crowded, causing residents who went to the site for vaccination to be whipped by Japanese puppet troops and police. The Shanghai Municipal Council police learned of this and specially sent more than ten Chinese police officers and one Japanese police officer yesterday to replace the Japanese troops and puppet police to maintain order at the site. Residents entered in an orderly manner, and there was no crowding yesterday. It is heard that after the vaccination is completed on the 10th, the Japanese side will investigate the households from the 11th and issue passes. Thereafter, residence and movement in the area will be subject to various inconveniences and restrictions.</p>

<h3>British Ships Traveling to the Far East; Route Changed to Pass Through the Cape of Good Hope; Long Voyage and Reduced Schedule; Decline in European Cargo</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of war in Europe, the ships of belligerent countries sailing on the Far East route have been greatly affected. For business reasons, they have to maintain navigation. Fearing accidents in the middle of the voyage, they strictly keep the schedule and route secret. It is heard that the British ships are taking a detour for safety, passing through Mumbai and then turning to the Cape of Good Hope. The voyage is long. Previously, it only took 445 days to reach London from Shanghai, but now it takes more than two months. Therefore, the number of ship schedules has been reduced, and the cargo transported to Europe has also declined. However, the cargo transported to various parts of Southeast Asia is more congested than before. Today, a British ship is returning to Europe and will travel according to the new route.</p>

<h3>British Overseas Service Association: Seeking Collaboration with Soldiers, Requesting Opinions from British Communities, Hoping for Joint Action</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that the committee of the British Overseas Service Association, organized by British residents in Shanghai who participated in the World War, held a meeting early last month. They unanimously resolved to consider raising funds in Shanghai to assist British troops serving in various war zones during this war, especially those about to leave Shanghai and other Chinese ports to return home for active duty, and to maintain contact with them. With this purpose in mind, to avoid conflicting with the efforts of other British organizations, the committee has sent letters to leading figures in various British organizations, seeking their opinions and suggestions. The registration office of the British Overseas Service Association has now been opened to register all British residents about to leave Shanghai and other Chinese ports for war service. The committee intends to communicate with British residents who go to war and wish to maintain contact with Shanghai. The committee will decide on the detailed proposals for its war fund after receiving replies from other British organizations. However, the committee strongly opposes fragmented action and believes they will gain the support and cooperation of the British community in Shanghai and British people in China in general. The British Women's Association is also engaged in very useful wartime work, and its appeals for donations and purchases have received the full support of the British community.</p>

<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that Swiss nationals and their friends in Shanghai gathered at the residence of Mr. Fontanel, the Swiss Chargé d'Affaires and Consul-General in Shanghai, on Saturday, Sunday, and yesterday afternoon to watch a sound film of Swiss army maneuvers. Mr. Fontanel delivered a concise and sincere speech to those present, firmly stating Switzerland's readiness to defend its borders and independence, and expressing complete confidence in the Swiss army's ability to cope with any unforeseen circumstances. The film was shot a year ago, so it does not include the latest developments in Switzerland's recent investment in strengthening national defense. However, the film has given viewers a deep impression of the difficulty for invaders to break through the country's defenses.</p>
<h3>Fire in Hongqiao Road Slum: Forty to Fifty Houses Destroyed, Three Residents Injured and Sent to Hospital for Treatment, Civilians Slept on the Streets Last Night, a Tragic Sight</h3>
<p>After the "August 13th" incident, poor people who could not afford the high rents in the concessions and had nowhere to live, built shacks or wooden houses on the vacant land of Xu Wu's family residence on Hongqiao Road, Xujiahui.</p>
<p>Gradually, more and more people gathered, and now there are hundreds of households, row upon row. There are also several small factories built on the site. Unexpectedly, at 3:45 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in one of the households in the slum, and the fire spread rapidly, engulfing the surrounding households. All the residents carried the old and helped the young, and hurriedly fled for their lives.</p>
<p>The cries and screams shook the neighborhood. Upon receiving the news, the fire brigades of the Public Concession and the French Concession rushed to the scene. After the firefighters worked hard to extinguish the fire using fifteen fire trucks, the fire was finally brought under control at around 5:00 AM. Because there was no running water in the area, they had to connect water pipes to Haig Road, which made firefighting very difficult. As a result, about</p>
<p>forty to fifty shacks and bungalows were burned down. Rumors that thousands of houses were burned down are not accurate. When the fire was raging, three residents were burned. One was Pan A'san (33 years old) from Yancheng, who was injured in the head and legs; one was a local child, Niu Xiaoshu (11 years old), who was injured in the head and face; and the other's name is unknown, and only suffered minor injuries. All were sent to the</p>
<p>hospital by car for treatment. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation by the police. However, thousands of civilians are exposed to the heavy dew in this deep autumn, and last night they all slept on the streets next to the fire scene, pale with hunger and cold, which is very tragic.</p>
<h3>Failure to Affix Stamps: Fined</h3>
<p>The Longgong Hotel, opposite the Xiaocai Market in the French Concession's Ba Xian Qiao area, was reported to the French police for violating the wartime regulations by failing to affix stamp tax stamps to passenger notification and payment slips in early last month. Detectives were sent to investigate and brought the hotel's account books and invoice notifications to the case. Later, Ding Sheng, also known as Ding Zishu (41 years old, from Linhai), the manager of the hotel, was summoned to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for prosecution. After questioning by Wu Kechou, he was ordered to pay a fine of 200 yuan. Ding Sheng claimed that as the manager of the Longgong Hotel, he has always handled the affixing of stamps in accordance with the Stamp Tax Law and has not violated any regulations. He has stated his reasons for disagreement and filed an appeal to the original court, requesting that it be transferred to a higher court for fair handling.</p>
<h3>Qingyu Lane Dispute: Tenants Fined, Sentences Suspended for Two Years Each</h3>
<p>The manager of the houses in Qingyu Lane, Chongqing Road, the Women's Bank, taking advantage of the current period of high demand for housing, ordered all 3,000+ tenants in the lane to vacate the premises under the pretext of needing to rebuild new houses, resulting in a lawsuit. Although the Women's Bank won the case and reached the stage of enforcement, disputes arose repeatedly due to the tenants' opposition. On October 22nd, before the Women's Bank received the court's order for compulsory enforcement, it surrounded the lane with bamboo fences, attempting to start demolition. This led to another dispute as tenants removed the bamboo fences. The Women's Bank reported this to the police, and the police arrested Gu Jiren, Jiang Jinkui, and Lu Dongyang, tenants who were removing the fences at the scene. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, also prosecuted lawyer Ping Jin'ya and painter Qian Huafu on charges of instigating the incident. The defendants hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to defend them. The interrogation has been completed, and the details have been reported in previous issues. Yesterday morning, Judge Meng Tingke opened the Fourth Criminal Court and announced the judgment: Gu Jiren, Jiang Jinkui, and Lu Dongyang were each fined 200 yuan for damaging the property of others, and their sentences were suspended for two years. Ping Jin'ya and Qian Huafu were acquitted.</p>
<h3>Bomb Explodes: Entire Flock of Ducks Killed</h3>
<p>Lu Yong'sheng, a farmer from Yangjing Town, Pudong, also raises ducks for a living. At 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, he drove a large flock of more than 300 ducks to Huacao Da Port, about two li south of Yangjing, to forage for food. It turned out that a heavy incendiary bomb was buried by the riverbank there. It was dropped by a Japanese plane during the August 13th Shanghai battle two years ago. It had fallen into the mud and had not yet exploded. As the ducks were swimming and looking for snails near the water's edge, it is presumed that their beaks touched the detonator on the bomb. With a deafening roar, the houses in the surrounding area shook, and thick smoke and flames soared into the sky. The bomb fragments scattered. Because the bomb contained a lot of explosives, the flames burned fiercely and continuously. All 300+ ducks floating on the river surface at that location were killed or burned to death, not one was spared. After hearing the explosion and seeing the smoke, the Japanese Marines suspected that something was wrong and immediately sent a team to patrol the area, only to find out the truth. Although Lu was not arrested, he kept lamenting his bad luck.</p>

They were spotted by Chinese Constable No. 1858, who immediately rescued them. The woman was unconscious due to swallowing too much water, while the man was still conscious. When the Chinese Constable asked for his name, the man said that he was Wang Alin (26 years old), and the woman was his wife, Zhou (27 years old), both from Shaoxing. They were committing suicide because they were suffering from economic hardship and could not survive. The police then took the two to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>

The criminals rushed out from the roadside and surrounded the Chinese Constable. Four of the criminals each held a pistol, aiming at the constable and forbidding him to move. One of the criminals, holding a pair of sharp scissors, took the opportunity to cut the thick black silk cord attached to the handle of the constable's official pistol and snatched the gun away. They then scattered and fled without a trace. The Chinese Constable was unable to give chase and immediately returned to the Hongkou Police Station to report the incident and request an investigation.</p>
<h3>Jiu Xing Theater Employee Assaults Student</h3>
<p>Hua Nanguan (20 years old, resident of No. 16, Lane 3, Seymour Road), a student at Guanghua University, went to the Jiu Xing Theater on Fuxing Road to watch a movie at around 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the first of this month. Because he lost his ticket, he was looking down to search for it, and the ticket checker mistook Hua for a thief and, along with a teahouse attendant and others, beat Hua until he was injured. Hua Nanguan had life insurance with China United Assurance Corporation. After the incident, a doctor from China United Assurance Corporation examined Hua and confirmed that his seventh rib on the right side was broken, and his temples and right chest were swollen. He then reported the incident to the police by telephone. Upon receiving the report, the police dispatched detectives to arrest several suspects and detained them at the police station, awaiting transfer to the Second Special District Court for interrogation today.</p>

<p>During the second hurricane that struck Shanghai on August 30th of this year, a female seamstress from Ningbo, Wang Chen (39 years old, resident of No. 27, Runde Lane, Qianjiatang, Huanlong Road, French Concession), left home to go to work at 4:45 AM that morning. As she was walking in front of the Kyoto Restaurant at No. 983 Avenue Joffre, in the midst of a storm and heavy rain, the horizontal sign above the main entrance of the Kyoto Restaurant, which had not been repaired for many years, was blown down by the wind. It struck Chen's head, causing a hole in her skull. She was sent to Guangci Hospital but died despite medical treatment. The corpse was examined and identified by the court. Because her family was in Ningbo, a cousin of the deceased was authorized to collect the body. Details of this event were recorded by the newspaper. At the time of the incident, a passerby was also injured, he was sent to the hospital for treatment and recovered. The French Concession police charged Lin Weirong (45 years old), the owner of the Kyoto Restaurant, from Ningbo, with criminal negligence resulting in death because he failed to pay attention beforehand, leading to the accidental disaster. Lin Weirong was summoned to the station to investigate the matter and was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday morning, where Judge Zhang Minsheng presided over the trial. Yuan Jiahong, the lawyer representing the French Concession administrative authorities, stated the facts of the case and filed a lawsuit on charges of negligence causing death. The defendant, Lin Weirong, testified that the sign had been repaired last year but not this year, and it was an accident that it was blown down by the hurricane. The court reviewed the testimony and decided to reschedule the hearing for the sixth day. The defendant was released on bail pending trial.</p>

They elected Jin Tianmin, Hu Hensheng, Li Zhuan, Guan Jian Dong, and others as the organizing committee, and the preparations are almost complete. It is scheduled that the association will hold its first fundraising performance on Double Ten Day at the Green Treasure Theater. The script selected is "Unresponsible Dad," also known as "Wu Hua Guo" (Fig), written and directed by Liu Yixin.</p>

<h3>From "Natural Disposition" to "Bandit" (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ren</p>
<p>Some things are better left unconsidered, for upon closer examination, one often gets a startling revelation.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, a few years ago, a group of literati suddenly "woke up!" and began shouting themselves hoarse about "natural disposition," "natural disposition," "natural disposition." Following this, there was a surge in the reprinting of literary collections from the late Ming and early Qing dynasties that "expressed natural disposition." To further realize the original flavor of "natural disposition literature," the format of the books was made particularly archaic, and there was no need for any editing: no paragraph breaks, no punctuation.</p>
<p>Naturally, "natural disposition literature" is good, and it is also good to evoke "ancient feelings." Some of the reprinted collections were indeed works that "expressed natural disposition." Our literati are absolutely correct in what they say about those authors: they talked about "detachment," "elegance," and even "transcendence." However, tracing the roots of why they spoke in that way can be a bit of a "downer." Some of them: saw that the Ming Dynasty was about to fall, that society was becoming increasingly uneasy, felt the danger to their own status, and had no other way out, so they had to resort to that kind of talk to fool others and fool themselves. Others of them: lived under the rule of the Qing Dynasty, either as officials or not, but dared not say anything anyway, so they also had to resort to that kind of talk to fool others and fool themselves. – Thus, works that "expressed natural disposition" were produced. Naturally, some of the works were indeed not bad, but their origin was a dead end, even lacking in ambition. Now, our literati insist on promoting that kind of literature, which inevitably gives people the impression that our literati are not only preparing to become writers in the kind of environment that existed in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, but also teaching all those who can write how to maintain their literary status on that day.</p>
<p>But even all the works that "expressed natural disposition" are not entirely as clean as our literati say. Many of them originally not only "expressed natural disposition" but also "expressed resentment," but that resentment has long since been dug out, so we cannot see it. The digging out of resentment was naturally partly due to the "achievements" of the literary inquisition, but partly also due to the descendants of the authors secretly doing it for the sake of their own safety and official careers. – Thus, only pure "works that express natural disposition" remained. Our literati completely ignore these facts and only treat what remains, which can ensure the safety and official careers of future generations, as treasures. This cannot but make people feel that our literati are indeed very sensitive to the times, and their plans are as thorough as can be.</p>
<p>In addition to talking about "natural disposition," another type of young literati talking about history is also worth noting.</p>
<p>This type of young literati still talks about the history of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. – This is naturally correct, and no one can say that it is meaningless at the moment. Moreover, there are still many books of the "History of Pain" and "Unofficial History of the Late Ming Dynasty" type on old book stalls, and some of them have already been edited a few years ago, so it is very convenient to just copy a little to make an article. However, if we are allowed to examine it carefully, there is a flaw that is revealed. The young literati seem to be copying too faithfully, and they call the peasants who rebelled at the end of the Ming Dynasty "bandits," "bandits," "bandits," and they also see those who "surrendered to the bandits" as heavily sinful, always attaching this kind of writing style to the narration of the historical facts of the Qing Dynasty's beginning of its rule over China. Although this is admirable in terms of copying skills, it is ultimately not a correct view. At the same time, this also shows that although our young literati are another type, they are actually inheriting the literary tradition of the "natural disposition" literati.</p>
<p>In the early Qing Dynasty, those "bandits" were of course extremely hateful in the "writings of hermits," but the earliest Ming Dynasty was precisely built with the help of those "bandits," and after it rose, it exploited them, so that they had no way to be the peasants they were supposed to be and could only continue to be "bandits." But this time, the big shots in the court came up with an even better solution: to invite the Qing army to enter the Pass. The founding emperor of the Qing Dynasty had an extremely cunning "cultural policy": as long as you did not scold "Great Qing," it was okay to talk about the Qing army's abuse of the Han people, because that could show the might of "Great Qing."</p>
<h3>Serenade</h3>
<p>— Xu Ye</p>
<p>Sweet Osmanthus</p>
<p>A paulownia leaf flutters from the vast clear sky, bringing a message to the traveler: autumn is in Jiangnan.</p>
<p>The bright sky always has a thin gray cast, and the scorching sun can only be lost in the southwest. Looking at the entire autumn sky from an evergreen tree in front of a window, watching the clouds lingering on the corner of the sky, like silver snakes, more like gold-woven dragons, twisting, dancing, although its brilliant time is short and fleeting, yet, therefore, I sing once the purity of the autumn sky.</p>
<p>Last night, silently, alone, I walked in the night street, crowded in the rolling tide of people, surging back and forth in the noisy sound of cars, I walked unconsciously for two hours, when I ran past the door of a flower shop, I was stunned by a certain kind of dazzling color.</p>
<p>"The sweet osmanthus is blooming!"</p>
<p>Greedily and lovingly, I finally sighed.</p>
<p>Let the owner of the flower shop look at me, let the flowers on the glass counter look at me, obviously suggesting: you should go, who gave you the stay here?</p>
<p>The night breeze brushed into my clothes, and the slightly drooping limbs evoked the feeling on my nerves. To see the flowers, I have to go back to my hometown, today in my hometown is the season when the sweet osmanthus is blooming on the branches.</p>
<p>Life once had a brilliant spring, but also had an elegant autumn; autumn is coming, I am willing to gallop on the vast farmland, listening quietly to the singing of the charming village girls, is a reed flute, is a silver bell, the breath of the September wind swaying the fragrant scent of rice. I also wish to lie high on the banks of the river, watching the night spread sleep through the seams of the sweet osmanthus leaves, the eastern moon appearing to comfort me, so, in the blue dreams, I am excited.</p>
<p>"Listen to the wild geese, appreciate the moon, watch the azaleas, string together your beautiful poem!"</p>
<p>How is the beautiful poem now? This longing is entrusted to the distant horizon. But wandering is month after month, day after day, but I am afraid to see this year's autumn moon and sweet osmanthus.</p>
<p>Is the sweet osmanthus still blooming all over the walls of the homeland under the flames of war?</p>
<p>This has become a question, I stubbornly and stubbornly pick up the pen, ready to remotely inquire about the news of the sweet osmanthus that comes once a year to the fields of my hometown...</p>
<h3>Flat Rice Sales (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Mu Chang</p>
<p>Old Zhou was wearing an old raincoat, a chilling draft on his chest, and he touched his forehead, feeling a bit feverish. But he waved his baton, unconcerned.</p>
<p>The sun peeked out from the cloudy sky, a faint light reflecting the shimmering rain. People felt a different kind of radiance and hope. They craned their necks, even hungrier.</p>
<p>Like a drowned rat, Little Zhang darted around on the street, tirelessly maintaining order, often using his baton instead of his voice; then he found a long bamboo pole, which made things easier for him. If anyone tried to jump the queue, he’d pull a Jiang Taigong fishing trick.</p>
<p>"Pig!"</p>
<p>Old Zhou strolled over, shifting to the "rear guard," and "lectured" a long line of cowering people: "...Hey, why are you pushing so hard? No need to shove, you can't get into the hall until eight o'clock! Yesterday, the iron gate was pushed open and people were trampled to death, who wants to be next…damn it," he threatened, brandishing his baton.</p>
<p>A long line, like crabs with severed claws, rested in the wet mud, sighing. They all looked eastward: Would the iron gate open? They dared not push forward, but those behind kept pushing. Some twisted their bags into ropes, straining their necks, teeth grinding. They were silent, silent. Several women huddled in a corner under broken umbrellas, weeping.</p>
<p>Old Zhou caught sight of them and felt a surge of pleasure: You want to eat white rice, do you! He let out a vindictive sneer, turned away, and never looked back.</p>
<p>He waded through the water, shouting, "Humph, you need to buy rice tickets first, dark ones are four jiao for two sheng, blue ones are one yuan for five sheng… Pigs, got it?"</p>
<p>The long line swayed again. They clutched their bags and baskets, examining the banknotes in their hands, only to find them crumpled. They cried out in despair. Some frantically searched their pockets, their bodies jostled back and forth… "Oh dear, my four mao ticket is gone!"</p>
<p>"Ouch…"</p>
<p>Old Zhou approached and yelled, "Bastard, check again, check your pockets."</p>
<p>Several panicked, rummaging frantically, then came the weeping.</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>"Oh dear, a string, a string, life and death matter!" Old Zhou turned his head: a rickshaw was being pulled from the street corner, carrying a terribly fat young lady, who looked at the crowd of people buying flat-priced rice. She said to the rickshaw puller, "Hey, A Shou, put up the awning, the rain is awful."</p>
<p>The rickshaw puller put down the rickshaw and busied himself raising the awning.</p>
<p>"A Shou, they are working so hard in the rain, why didn't they buy some rice beforehand and store it at home?" A surprised voice came from inside the awning.</p>
<p>Old Zhou found it jarring and went to interfere: "Hey, be sensible, pull over to the left of the barrier rope!"</p>
<p>The rickshaw puller shot a white look, rubber shoes squeaking like water rats, and pulled the rickshaw away.</p>
<p>Old Zhou's heart flared with anger, he felt terrible. He hysterically ran back to the iron gate, only to see a bald middle-aged man dangerously hoisting a bag near the gate.</p>
<p>"Trying to push again?" He waved his baton, heading forward to pull the bald man away. The man turned around, saw it was the policeman, and timidly retreated into the crowd. He harshly pulled the crowd and yelled for them to line up.</p>
<p>The rain stopped again, and the sunlight faintly shone on the road.</p>
<p>The crowd was too dense, and the bald man was pushed out again, clutching his bag. He stood on the steps, head hanging down, motionless. Old Zhou was furious and charged over: "Get out of here!" He wanted to hit him with the baton, but his vision blurred and he felt strangely empty, wanting to vomit. He stood still, observing the bald man’s haggard state.</p>
<p>The bald man stood blankly for a moment, then threw the bag to the ground. He then collapsed softly to the ground. His face pressed tightly against the wet ground, lying very quietly.</p>
<p>The crowd roared again, the long line swaying. Old Zhou hurried over, thinking: "That's odd, has this fellow not even eaten enough noodles? Or is it heatstroke? Deadly…"</p>
<p>He pushed through several people, wanting to lift the bald man, but suddenly heard a buzzing in his head, his ears pressed painfully. He reached up and realized that someone had thrown a basket that hit him on the head, knocking his police cap askew.</p>
<p>"You're the 'pig'! The sick come for rice, squeezed to death, and you still pull them, knocking them down! Humph…" A sharp roar came from the crowd, it sounded strangely familiar. He looked over: the man was tilting his head smugly - a battered black lacquer kepi perched on his head, gesticulating wildly.</p>
<p>He jumped up in astonishment: it was none other than Ah Mao, that little devil!</p>
<p>He rubbed his eyes again, confirmed it really was him, and roared, lunging forward: this little devil is getting out of control, daring to hit me? I'll smash him into "noodle cake", damn it…</p>
<p>As he got closer, the little devil saw it was "him," panicked, threw down his hat and dove into the crowd.</p>
<p>The long line roared again, snaking forward.</p>
<h3>Afterthoughts</h3>
<p>Our publication has limited space and needs concise, pithy works, as has been repeatedly stated. However, most of the submissions we receive are still lengthy epics, often one or two thousand words. Although these manuscripts are dazzling and beautiful, they create layout problems, forcing us to reluctantly reject them, or shelve them indefinitely, delaying their publication. Therefore, I hope those submitting manuscripts will send shorter pieces, preferably under a thousand words, ideally five to seven hundred words, which would be convenient for both parties.</p>
<h3>As I Wish</h3>
<p>— Liu You</p>
<p>I have countless wishes, constantly reflected in my mind, never leaving me alone. I cherish them, nurturing them with various appropriate methods. I have also inserted these wishes into my songs, constantly chanting them. I am always hoping, and I pray for success.</p>
<p>Will there be a day when I get my wish? I often ask myself this. I wish to be a seagull flying in the high sky, far from dark corners, looking down upon a bright world; nobility and purity will always be my companions.</p>
<p>I also wish to be a tree near the water, growing so large, preventing the water from rushing ashore and causing disasters, making mankind safe and even happier.</p>
<p>All my wishes enable me to hate darkness and depravity, to reject them, and even to drive them away.</p>
<p>Hoping all day long, hoping I can get my wish, I will strive with great excitement, and effort, constantly thinking, acting…to make my wish come true.</p>
<p>I know there are countless people who have the same wishes as me, they also hope to get their wish, and they are also working hard.</p>
<p>Who can understand people's aspirations, people's prayers, people's wishes? And the people in this era should be filled with the emotions of the era, moving with the times, all having great, noble, and possible wishes.</p>
<p>We can get our wish, we have the faith of the masses, we have the power of the people.</p>

<h3>Expectations for Song Dezhu: Combining the Strengths of the Four Great Dan Actresses into One, Preserving the Unique and Superb Art of the Martial Dan</h3>
<p>— Tong Qiyu Yi</p>
<p>Several years ago, when I was still living in Beiping, my friend Mr. Gu Huiyin wrote a lengthy essay titled "On the Dan Actresses of the Opera School," published in the entertainment section of the Liyan Bao, which greatly interested readers at the time. Because at that time, the most popular dan actresses in the opera school were the female actress Zhao Jinrong, Song Dezhu was only known for her martial dan plays, and Hou Yulan had just entered the opera school and had not yet appeared on any playbills! However, Mr. Huiyin's vision was truly exceptional. In his essay on the dan actresses of the opera school, he pointed out the various strengths and weaknesses of Zhao Jinrong and Song Dezhu. His conclusion was that Song Dezhu had the greatest potential, not only in martial plays, but also in future performances of Hua Shan and other civil plays, her achievements would surpass all others. This comment, after three to five years, is still deeply imprinted in the minds of old opera enthusiasts in the former capital. Because Mr. Huiyin's prediction was truly accurate. Not only was his comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of Song and Zhao accurate, but even Hou Yulan's Qingyi plays becoming popular was within his old man's prophetic vision!</p>
<p>Although my eyesight is not as sharp as Mr. Huiyin's, I also believe that Dezhu's excellence is evident to all. Now, Dezhu's Yingguang Troupe has been performing at the Golden Grand Theater for several days, and everyone agrees that Dezhu's singing is sweet and melodious, her expressions are delicate, and her martial skills are solid, truly worthy of being the leader of the Four Little Famous Dan Actresses.</p>
<p>In fact, art has no limits. Later generations, on the one hand, must imitate the advantages of their predecessors to prevent the loss of the unique features of Chinese opera art. On the other hand, they may also innovate and create new paths themselves. For example, Mei Wan-Hua and Cheng Yu-Shuang's new tunes were derived from Chen Delin and Wang Yaoqing, but the application of the old tunes was indeed not as pleasing to the ear as the new tunes. However, new creations must have a certain scope, be disciplined, and not be merely a pretense. Although Cheng Yu-Shuang's Cheng Tune was unique, it had been instructed by Wang Yaoqing, not deviating from the scope of the beautiful art of the old opera. Although Song Dezhu's amazing skills have many sets that others do not know, they have also been taught by Jiu Zhenfeng and Zhu Yukang. With Dezhu's mastery of martial dan and Hua Shan skills, maintaining the championship of the Four Little Famous Dan Actresses from today onwards is not a problem. We are even more willing to particularly expect her to: (1) combine the strengths of the Four Great Dan Actresses into one, excelling in the advantages of various schools. (2) strive to maintain and develop the unique skills of the martial dan, without complacency or slackness! Regarding the first point, in recent years, Dezhu has personally received the teachings of Wang Yaoqing, and has been gifted with secret texts, and the famous playwright Mr. Wu Huansun has specially written famous plays for her. It can be said that she has already partially achieved the goal of integrating the strengths of various schools. Therefore, I write these two opinions not only to provide a reference for the Ping opera world, but also for the audience who love Dezhu's art, may also measure the true value of her art based on these two points.</p>
<h3>Continued Preview of First-Run Films for Double Tenth Festival</h3>
<p>— Xin Li</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Liang's "Preview of First-Run Films for Double Tenth Festival" in yesterday's edition of this publication, I felt that there were still some errors in the content that had to be corrected, and domestic films were not mentioned. Therefore, after my investigation, I hereby report as follows.</p>
<p>The Double Tenth Festival film at Guotai has now been decided, and it is neither "Three Brave Men" nor "Iron Horse" (however, these two films will still be screened at the theater after the Double Tenth Festival). It is "Blossoms Beyond the Curtain," starring Dolores del Río, with the joint performance of major stars such as Jack Penny and Edward Arnold. The film is a Hollywood-style comedy. Dolores del Río's previous films have mainly focused on singing. This time she changed her style, and it is said that she has a surprising performance.</p>
<p>By the way, let me mention here that the "Magnificent Ambersons," starring Paul Muni and Bette Davis, which will be screened at Daguangming during the Double Tenth Festival, is rumored to increase its ticket price.</p>
<p>As for domestic films. Xinguang will screen "Wang Xifeng's Great Disturbance in Ningguo Mansion." The film is produced by Hua Xin, entirely in ancient costume, with a grand scale, using more capital and technical talent than "Wu Zetian." The filming was suspended twice due to the illness of the lead actress, Gu Lanjun. The director is Yue Feng, and the cast includes major stars such as Mei Xi, Li Hong, Lu Luming, and Bai Hong, in addition to Gu Lanjun. According to people in the film industry, it is rumored that Gu Lanjun may soon leave Xinhua and form a company with Yuan Meiyun and others.</p>
<p>Jincheng originally planned to stage "Seven Heavens," a collective work by Guohua following "New Hell," but because the filming of that film was not completed in time, it was changed to "Little Female Knight." "Little Female Knight" is also a Guohua production, and is another masterpiece by child star Hu Rongrong and Gong Qiuxia after "Song Brother Saves Mother."</p>
<h3>Entertainment in a Charity Dance</h3>
<p>— Chou Cheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held a charity dance competition at the Metropolis Ballroom on the afternoon of the first of this month, and invited entertainers to perform to add to the fun. Lü Xiaofeng and Yu Xiangming jointly performed the comic "Chopping the Scripture Hall." Lü wore armor but cloth shoes, and instead of a sword, he wore a command knife. At the opening, he said that his singing and acting were better than Qilin Tong, and everyone praised him, thanks to his old face, everyone laughed heartily. Yu wore a red skirt but was bare-chested, and two fake breasts moved as he walked, making people feel goosebumps. Deng Guoqing performed his skills with free movement, all real skills, and can be called divine. The modern couple competition, originally scheduled to be jointly performed by Zhang Yie'er, Jiang Xiaoxiao, He Shuangdai, Pei Yanghua, Lu Xixi, Tang Xiaofei and others, had already written the script, but because they were all out performing in temple fairs, Zhang Yie'er publicly apologized. They also invited Xiao Kuaile and Yang Liu Dun to jointly perform the comic couple, surprisingly the two wore formal attire, with two children pulling the veil for them, and they entered the pool hand in hand, while the bride sang a love song, and the groom reported the love process, detailing how one met in a small vegetable market, and then arranged to eat in a small restaurant and stay in a small inn, and Bao Yifei and Cheng Xiaofei, acting as guests, gave speeches, Bao spoke Pudong dialect, and Cheng spoke Wuxi dialect, with local expressions such as "big boss" and "spinning around" blurted out, being humorous and causing people to laugh until their stomachs hurt. Upon entering the venue, this comic couple also cupped their hands and shouted "Uncle" to Yuan Ludeng, nicknamed "Mr. Nice," and the guests were all amused.</p>
<h3>The Magistrate's Punishment of an Actor</h3>
<p>— Shiweixuan</p>
<p>I previously saw the reprinting of the Yang Yuelou case in Shen Bao's old newspaper, and I was reminded of an old case. In the 27th and 28th years of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, there was a Hua Dan actress named Gao Caiyun, whose fame was unparalleled in Shanghai. She had dealings with high officials and wealthy people, so the concubines of officials, the mistresses of the wealthy, and even the daughters of famous families, all wanted to share a piece of her, and jealousy and competition were often heard of. Among them, the wife of a wealthy merchant had particularly close dealings with her. The merchant was afraid of his wife and did not know what to do when he first learned of it. One day, the merchant returned from outside and saw Gao whispering intimately with his wife. The merchant could not restrain himself and scolded them. Gao was not afraid, but instead threatened him with a kitchen knife on the table. The merchant left in anger and filed a complaint with the Shanghai County Office. The magistrate at the time was Wang Xinpu of Haining, who had a reputation for integrity. He immediately ordered the actor to be brought to court. Gao was fearless and composed. The initial trial was inconclusive. The next morning, when the trial was held, the spectators were packed, all wanting to see how the virtuous magistrate would punish this lewd actor! As Magistrate Fang took his seat and began questioning, a yamen runner suddenly presented two telegrams. Magistrate Wang smiled and placed them on the table, not opening them immediately. After briefly questioning, he ordered the actor to be beaten with fifty strokes of the bamboo, and displayed in the cangue for two months. The spectators all praised him. After returning to the signing room, he opened the telegrams, which were from the Suzhou Provincial Treasurer pleading for leniency for the actor. Magistrate Wang smiled and said to his attendants, "If I had read them in court, I would have been deceived by the lewd actor again, and the fifty strokes could not have been carried out." At the time, it was very satisfying, but soon Magistrate Wang was dismissed from his position, rumored to be related to this case.</p>
<h3>Artist News</h3>
<p>— Huicun</p>
<p>Ma Yanxiang was previously hired by the Guilin National Defense Art Troupe as a drama instructor. Recently, he brought his new wife from Haiphong back to Chongqing and joined the China Film Studio as a member of the directing committee.</p>
<p>Tian Han is currently in Guilin, performing with a Hunan opera troupe, which is very popular among the locals. He will soon bring the troupe to Chongqing for performances.</p>
<p>Sun Shiyi is currently in Guilin and will go to Chongqing soon.</p>
<p>Cao Yu is currently in Kunming, serving as a professor at Southwest Associated University.</p>
<p>Zhao Huishen is currently in Chengdu, guest-starring in a film for the Northwest Film Company. After filming, she will go to Chen Liting in the Northwest to jointly participate in the drama movement in the war zone.</p>
<p>Cheng Bugao is currently in Kunming, entrusted with an important mission. He will soon return to Haiphong to take on an important position. When asked about the film industry, Cheng was reluctant to mention the past, and seemed tired of the film life.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Actors and Opium</p>
<p>Moreover, when they have to rush to the performance, if they have not smoked enough opium, and are anxious, and their liver fire flares up, plus their throat is dry after just smoking, their throat will definitely lock up and they won’t be able to make a sound, which is particularly difficult. Therefore, the throat is very delicate. Usually, you must take extra care of it, and you must use it properly when the time comes. Being able to use the precious "smoky voice" to emit a round and bright sound to please the audience, that is not in vain to violate national laws and develop bad habits, gradually creating the original intention of the "smoky voice." If you only focus on the false appearance, thinking that all famous actors and Tan school bearded men must first have the title of opium addict, as if it is not enough to show that they are "Tan school" if they do not, then that person is undoubtedly foolish, and their fundamental inability to understand the relationship between opium and the actor's throat is also an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Before Gao Qingkui's voice collapsed, his voice was extremely powerful. Who knew that after he quit smoking five years ago, his voice suddenly became hoarse and he couldn't utter a word. At that time, I was in Beiping, and one night at Guan Dayuan's house, I saw Dayuan naked, with a plaster pasted on his chest, watching a blister slowly rise. Then, Guo Zhongheng's uncle (a Western doctor) took a needle and inserted it into the blister, extracting the liquid inside, and then injected it into his buttocks. At that time, Qingkui and Liankui stood aside, praising the magic of this method of quitting smoking, and comforting Dayuan with words, saying, "Yuming, don't worry, this method is very safe. My brother and I both quit smoking using this method by Guo." Qingkui's accompanist was his younger brother Liankui. The two brothers were extremely lazy during the smoking cessation period. At that time, they did not form a troupe to perform, so of course they did not need to practice their voices. (一一一)</p>
