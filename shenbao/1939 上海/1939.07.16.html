<p>社評</p>
<h3>存款外商銀行之謬見</h3>
<p>日昨渝電稱某經濟專家發表談話，謂上海方面自限制提存辦法實施後，金融市塲已大見穩定；但間有少數存戶，尙未切實明瞭國家及自身利害，仍有提款轉存外商銀行之舉；因此希望滬市居民從速糾正是項行動，萬勿爲蜚言所惑，輕作不智之舉；至於最妥善之辦法，莫如投資內地，不但切合國家民族之需要，且自身亦可獲致厚利云云。此其語在平時猶不失爲針對時弊之諍言；顧在當今，其意義更顯重大。經濟專家所言如是，同時渝報亦有同此意見，採作論評資料者，可見上海金融情態影響全國至深且巨；然則爲上海市民者，顧能不加之意耶？</p>
<p>自抗戰以來，中國人民咸知民族國家存亡所繫，輒不待徵發，自動貢獻其所能，所謂「有力者出力，有錢者出錢」是也。出力之方式不一，出錢之方式亦不一。捐輸也，獻金也，慰勞也，濟難也，均屬有形的出錢；顧乃有無形的出錢，其事至爲普徧，而迹象不甚顯著者，則國家銀行以及其他國籍銀行所擁有之萬千存戶是也。蓋就經濟常識解釋，存款於銀行，其性質即係委托銀行作企業之經營；銀行吸收無數存戶之資金，決非藏諸櫃笥，將以鉅額之集體資本投入於時代所需要之事業中。中日作戰以還，中國沿海各地相繼淪陷，抗戰根據地移往內地；然內地寳藏無盡，亟須開發，換言之，亟須開發之資金。內地原有之資金不足，必須集中全國資金，發揮其功能，此亦「力量集中」之一義也。故目前華商銀行之任務，即在運用可能集中之資金，投諸於內地事業之開發；此政策如能遂行無阻，則貢獻於抗戰建國者至爲鉅大。銀行之資金，即係萬千存戶之存款，然則推源溯流，此萬千存戶正對於國家民族作鉅大之貢獻也。自上海之以戰事而成爲國際特別區域，上海市民以及素稱經濟首區之江浙殷戶，咸麕集於此一隅，於是資金之積聚依人口之稠密爲正比；上海華商銀行之萬千存戶，允大多爲特區居民也。頗有嘲諷上海爲失却魂靈之天堂者，其實人同此心，心同此理，上海居民孰不眷戀其國族而悠然神往，孰不願得其當而自効其心力，曾何吝於所持有之資金，託付銀行，作間接之貢獻。顧乃蜚言所播，有提取華商銀行存款而轉存外商銀行者，寗非一念之錯覺歟？夫以政治或道德言之，則移款外銀之舉，豈徒蔽總塞明，實屬罪惡，更就經濟言之，蓋猶精神病者惟虞被殺，乃自絕生機，試先自殺，豈不愼乎？</p>
<p>推彼心跡，豈眞罔識大體哉！惑於蜚言，一時失察，遂錯謂中國幣制，或呈動搖，於是一念及私，遂致習非成是，此爲最普通之原因也。蓋日方侵略，軍事政治經濟，數管齊下；及今彼方師老兵敝，於是陰謀之强化及時，而謠言之滋生有地，內地不若是也；上海多蜚言，市民受蠱惑，誠有所自來矣。顧攻破謠言者，厥在時間所演成之事實，今茲金融市塲旣大見穩定，事實已彰彰在人耳目，誠所謂「造謠搗亂之破壞，雖或一時稍受影響，亦正如雲霧之蔽日月，頃刻間風消雲散，日月光明矣。」然則向之一時錯覺者，及時矯正，未爲晚耳！</p>
<h3>英日初步談話　磋商天津事件　克萊琪昨晨與有田會晤　談話歷五小時關防嚴密</h3>
<p>（東京）英大使克萊琪與田外相有田今晨舉行之初步談話、自九時零五分起十二時半止、談話時秘書或速記員皆不在側、午後日外務省發出公報略謂、會議逾三小時、克萊琪與有田對於成爲天津所發生局勢背景之一般問題、加以討論、現暫休會、俾有充分時間作繼續之考慮、將於七月十七日再舉行會議、（十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）英大使克萊琪與日外相有田、今晨九時零五分會晤、是爲行將舉行的英日會議之初步、日文報紙謂、日外相與英大使如不能解決「根本問題」、則所謂「地方事件會議」將不舉行、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本外相有田與英國駐日大使克萊琪、於今晨開始談判、日本外務省發表文吿如次、本日外相與莢大使在外部談判天津事件之問題、歷三小時始散、下次談判定於下星期一（十七日）舉行、本日外部及英使館之附近均甚安靜、報章則言論甚激、要求政府採取堅決之態度、切勿妥協、（十五日海通電）</p>
<p>（東京）此間報載、今晨外相與英大使談判時、並無第三人在側、往常有譯員通譯、此决並通譯員而無之、據聞日本外相於談判之始、陳述日方之意見、而英大使則詳陳英方之意見、（十五日海通電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報外交記者稱、東京會議命運如何、明日或星期一可以分曉、英政府必堅持談話限於與天津封鎖有關的地方問題之態度、政府中人以爲日內閣並未公然承認日報所載關於議程中條欵之半官消息、此或爲一種良好徵象、但英政府現正籌備一切、以防任何事變、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於東京方面昨所舉行之反英示威運動、外務部已於今晨接獲駐日大使克萊琪爵士報告、正縝密加以研究、據官方宣稱、克萊琪大使所提報吿、已將各報所載消息、予以證實、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>地點移東京之意義</p>
<p>（重慶）東京之英日會議刻開幕矣、此間華人各界對共進展、咸予以密切注意、其心目中最大疑問、爲英國將作多少讓步、以應付日本要求乎、英國不在天津採行强硬計畫、而允忍辱開談判於東京之事實、在華人觀之、殆英國亟欲以妥洽方法、使此問題不致擴大耳、各方面皆以爲會議結果、定將在遠東時局上、允其是在中日戰爭上、有遠大影響、據華人意見、談判由天津而移至東京、非因日本有和平解決之意、但因日本自信在東京可與英國討論非天津地方官所能討論之更廣泛問題、至於日政府現許東京民衆舉行反英示威運動、藉以宣洩民氣之說、華人各界殊不信之、謂日本民衆示威之目的有二、一爲加强日本在談判中之手腕、一爲抵銷外傳天津封鎖全由日本軍事當局發動之說、並謂東京談判決不能解決天津事件英國如不屈服、則日本不願甘休、如英國果願屈服、則何必需有此會議、且天津封鎖係欺月前日方已定之計畫、不過藉口於四人引渡問題爲發動耳、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>津日軍司令之談話</p>
<p>（東京）據今日此間消息、天津日軍司令本間中將於昨日招待日本新聞記者時、曾稱、觀於一月來日本國民對於孤立天津英法租界一舉之全力主持、可知我人直有貫澈我人原定目標之必要、假若英方對於會議範圍、堅持以地方事件爲限、則會議必致破裂、我人深信日本政府必能充分代表當地官方與全國國民之意見、英國目煎之地位、實處於歧途之中、英國究將與日本立於敵對地位與吾、惟有英國自擇之、且須常機立斷、本間末稱、假使會議破裂、則日本決取準備應付萬一事變之手段、（十五日美聯社電）</p>
<p>英國考慮援華辦法</p>
<p>（倫敦）政府方面昨晚暗示、倘日本於今日在東京舉行之英日談判時、堅持過份要求、則英國擬採取報複行動、即予蔣介石將軍以新軍火信用放款、中國正與英國接洽、在英國六千萬鎊國外貿易信用放款中、要求英國貸予中國信用放款三百萬鎊、倘日本在東京談判時提出廣大問題作爲解决天津事件、則中英信用放款談判、即可於東京議完畢後吿成、蓋英國以財政助華、作爲英日談判中之另一策略也、策劃中之三百萬錢信用放款、能助中國製造飛機及軍火廠、並得購買製造重砲之設備、現時中國軍火工業僅能製造步槍及機關槍等輕軍器而已、中國並能購買電氣廠及其他土木設備、以爲發展中國內地實業之需、英國要求中國銀行担保該項信用放款、然蔣介石將軍則提議以交通銀行担保之、良以中國銀行已經擔保美國進出口銀行貸華美金二千五百萬信用放款也、中國軍事需要、並無止境、三百萬鎊信用放款談判吿成後、即當考慮繼續財政助華問題、此間觀察家相信、除非日本陸軍當局釋放五月二十六日在張家口顯日軍拘留之英國駐華武官史比亞中校、則英國繼續以借款貸華頗屬可能、日本在東京談判、無疑的持有强硬紙牌、然於英國擬於日本提出過份要求時、採取報復行動一點觀之、顯示英國已準抵抗日本欲統治中國、尤其華北之挑戰、倘美國通過畢德門洗案、向日本施行廣泛制裁、則英國抵抗日木能力即得無涯增强、英國首相張伯倫、亦將步美國後塵、向下院提出同樣法案矣、日本深覺英國為歐洲問題牽制、並明瞭英國駐紮遠東軍隊實力之不足、東京方面更覺英國不願單獨向日本施行經濟制裁、除非美國已創導於先、英國對英國駐日大使克萊琪爵士、與日本外相有田談判、當取安逸態度、倘談判决裂、或英日衝突惡化、該項談判、即當永遠延擱、倘日方提出對津案無直接關係之要求、英國大使將答之日、該項問題、須與美法兩國商議後、始能解決、（十五日美聯電）</p>
<p>渝方對前途之觀察</p>
<p>（東京）中國人士刻以最密切之關懷、注視行將在東京舉行的英日會議之發展、蓋該會之結果、對於遠東大局、允其是中日戰事、將有遠大之影響也、華字報紙與公衆對該會之成功、始終懷疑、據稱、如有關各方之目的、純在解決天津爭執、而雙方均抱互讓精神、則該會始能成功、惟日本現無解決天津爭案之意、除非英國屆服接受東京較廣泛之要求耳、倫教所抱日方不致在東京會議中提出更廣泛問題之希望、此間華人認爲勢必失望、蓋天津之封鎖、非僅爲地方事件而發、日本於已往數月中、早已縝密準備在華北向英國作明顯表示矣、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（重慶）據中國一般人士之觀察、英日關係一時不能好轉、然觀於歐局之嚴重、英國亦未必任其對日關係激起惡化、中國人士以爲英日在遠東允其是在中國之利益、現有正面衝突、故預料英日關係一時不能好轉、據華人稱、日本刻正竭其所能、暗害在華之外國利益與勢力、而各國在華利益以英國爲最巨、然業已大受日方歧視之英國、不致放棄其費多年辛勞努力而得之巨大利益、英國此前在遠東採取最溫和之政策、推原其故、牟因英政府相信日本從無通度歧視英國之眞意、半因已往十年內、英國有事於歐洲等處而不能對遠東予以充分注意、此種利益衝突、旣長此存在、英日關係決不能好轉云、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦各報表示悲觀</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於英日兩國當局在東京進行談判事、各晨報頃加以評論咸皆表示悲觀、每日郵報載稱、「此項談判殊難樂觀、關於談判範圍如何、雙方意見大相懸殊、天津事件雖僅與英國一國有關、但日本若欲英國變更現行遠柬政策、則其他各國之在遠東保有利益者、顯皆牽涉在內、然則英國決不致遷就日本軍閥、而將其對於九國公的所提供之諾言予以遠反、殆有可斷言」、新聞紀事報載稱、「以遠東方面所傳來之消息而論、與其調日本人樂於和平談判、母寗謂其設法引起紛擾、吾國爲思患預防計、凡在中國境內所保有之租界、一時無法加以保護者、似宜暫行退出、同時並通吿日本政府謂舍此而外英國決當採取一切措置、用以維護其在遠東所保有之利益、」泰唔士報外交記者宣稱、「此項談判能吾有所成就、當視日本政府是吾僅以地方事件爲限、該國當局若果如該國各報所揣測、貿然提出共他問題、例如英國在華北應與日本合作」一項問題、則英國政府即當聲明、此種問題不但妨害英國利益、實亦危及美法兩國曁九國公的其他各簽字國在門戶開放政策下所保有之利益、自未便加以討論、關於議事日程內容如何、日本半官機關各報凡所登載者、迄未由日本內閣予以證實、此在英國外交當局或可認爲一種良好朕兆、但事變之來、不容邀睹、英國政府亦已籌備應付辦法矣、」（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英如採取堅强立塲　日決不敢挑戰　英梅軍大將凱葉斯演說</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英海軍艦隊司令凱葉斯大將今日在倫敦演說謂、英政府如探堅强立塲、日本決不敢與英帝國衝突、渠在日本前此兩决戰爭中、與日本頗多接近、當一九〇〇年渠與日軍聯絡作戰以解北平之圍時、渠對日軍具有武士精神之戰鬥力極爲重視、但此種精神、現已不複存在於日本海陸軍中矣、日本現忠實仿行其同志國日耳曼之手段、日木當不致愚昧若是、而信德國與共同盟國貿然向英法波土等國開戰後終可免於慘敗、故日本如不向英國相迫太甚、實屬得計、此爲渠之見解、英帝國財源工業與人力皆團結一致、決計抗敵、敵方知此、當不放對英挑釁、如果爲之、則敵方唯有失敗之一途耳、（十四日路透電）</p>

<h3>羅斯福赫爾咨文國會　促進修正中立法　務為國家安全利益着想　要求泯除黨爭重加考慮</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統昨以特別咨文致國會、請求在休會前批准中立法修正案、並取消現行中立法禁運軍火條例、同時國務卿赫爾、亦以特別咨文致國會、據謂渠對總統主張、完全贊同、據總統在咨文中稱「爲美國中立及安全起見、余深覺本屆國會理應採取某種必需之行動、以應付現存國際局勢、余絕無變更此種主張之理由、倘國會計不出此、則國會應負陷入戰爭危機之責任」（十五日美聯社電）</p>
<p>赫爾之咨文、則鄭重聲述避免一般人對美外交政策誤會及誤解之必要、彼云、美國之政策爲繼績維持和平、並謂渠對中立法之六大綱要、實有闡明之必要、按赫氏之六大綱要、爲白魯姆中立法案之基本原則、日前已爲眾院所修正、參院外委會亦已投票決定、展期討論、赫氏要求國會取消該案之一切黨派鬥爭、赫氏指出中立法對未來數月中美國之安全問題、極爲重要、赫氏鄭重聲稱、國外最近將有戰爭危機、末並謂國內外一部份人對中立法已有甚大之誤會云、（十五日美聯電）</p>
<h3>赫爾對中立法案　闡明六大綱要　廢除軍火禁運條款　認為弭戰有效辦法</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）赫爾國務卿送達國會之文告、全文共計六頁、乃爲政府撤廢軍火禁運條款之主張、說明理由、首謂美國現行外交一政策目標有二、爲本國保持和平維護安全、一也、加强國際法與倡導國際誠信、二也、和平極可寶貴、而戰爭則禍患極巨、美國人民與政府職責所在、自當視共力之所及、以協助和平之維護、「國際局勢岌岌可危、愛好和平之國如吾國者、於提出和平與中立政策之際、對於此種反常與緊急情勢、實未便置之不見不聞、反之、和平與中立之整個問題、及其在今後數閱月內對於美國安全與利益所可發生之影響、應予以密切注意、以余所見、政府對於此項問題、應即有所舉動、未可無故蹉跎、遺誤時機、而軍火禁運條款允宜予以撇廢、彼主張維持者、以爲此項辦法能使美國避不牽入戰爭漩渦、實則徒使美國輿論爲所眩感、因而相信虛偽與不合理之幻想」、按之此項條款、軍械彈藥與各種軍用品、均在禁止出口之列、而其他各種物品、同爲作戰所必需者，則可賡績輸出、是豈得謂爲合理、</p>
<p>前者余會函達參衆兩議院外交委員會、要求取銷軍火禁運條款、並提出中立計劉計分六點、可在最大範圍之內、保證美國不致牽入戰爭漩渦、所謂六點、（一）禁止美國船舶駛入戰爭區域、（二）限制美國人進入戰區、（三）美國各種貨物運往各交戰國者、宜在出口之前、將所有權過戶於外國買主、（四）禁止以現款或信用放款畀予各交戰國之現行辦法、宜予以保持、（五）爲各交戰國募捐事宜、釐訂規洌、（六）軍火出口現行監察制度、以及請領許可證之現行辦法、宜予以維持、凡此六點、乃經縝密研究後之收穫、他日戰事若果爆發、爲防止美國捲入漩渦起見、當以此爲最佳方式、以視現行中立法、「範圍廣大、而較為有效、似不致引起何項事故、且足使戰爭之爆發較為困難、吾國旣可嚴格保守中立、牽入戰事之危機、亦即隨之减少、値茲國際無政府狀態嚴重若是、和平在多處地方感受威脅之際、竊以爲保障吾國勿令牽入戰事之第一步辦法、厥爲在不違反傳統政策之範圍內、利用吾國之勢力、務使世界大戰爆發之可能性、儘量减少、政府職責、即在於此、此又不論何人均所灼見而無從加以吾認者」、</p>
<p>查政府所倡導之中立法案、旣與國際法相適應、對於一百五十年來美國所行政策、亦不相悖、「政府若干年來、孜孜矻矻、在傳統政策範圍之內、力求避免大戰之爆發、假令懊抱成見、而對於各外國有左右袒之意、某也予以援助、某也予以不利、則揆情度理、又何必以避免戰爭爲事歟、某某方面宜傳結果、使國人感有一種印象、以爲軍火禁運辦法若果撤廢、則行政權即爲之龐大、反之、維持禁運辦法、足以限制行政權、此種說法、並不確當、綠美國市場倘公諸於眾、聽任各國不分涇渭、前來購貨、實未見總統能藉此獲有便宜行事之權也、茲若維持禁遝辦法、徒足使各國之早已擴充軍備而佔有優勢者獲有便利、而各小國軍火之取給、有賴於美國一類國家、吾人倘拒不令其置有防禦所必需之工具、則信守國際法愛好和平之各國、在嚴重局勢之中、將無法自衛、是豈理之平哉」云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>滿洲是日本重累（續）</h3>
<p>— 伯明</p>
<p>軍閥攫取鐵路</p>
<p>但日本軍閥企圖獲得泰西保守黨的援助，操之過切，貿然和蘇聯敵對，蘇聯便利用日本軍閥的宣言，開始反日宣傳，好像其中有重大意義似的。日本軍閥自稱是「反赤化主義的屏障」，蘇聯接受這託詞，而因利乘便，說日本軍閥是反蘇的「帝國主義的槍頭。」在雙方確實指揮統制這政策和宣傳的人們的目光中，這是一種模擬戰。日本軍閥試圖獲得泰西保守黨的同情和援助，蘇聯却藉共產國際而圖傳得泰西自由黨，和平主義者，和勞工的贊助。但有許多日人和蘇聯人，——甚至在官憲間，——竟認眞地從事宜傳「戰」，而日本軍閥用這種方法來向泰西保守黨獻媚的企圖，當然使蘇聯各界大起仇視。</p>
<p>事有較此更重要的，便是一九三三年關東軍攫奪中東路的企圖，他們所鑄的大錯，莫甚於此。一九二九年，蘇聯人已表不許華方攫奪他們有價値而獲厚利的鐵路綫，但至一九三三年，滿洲的日本軍閥開始逮捕蘇聯籍的鐵路人員，和阻撓他們管理鐵路錢，意圖攫奪中東路，和五年前華方所用的方法，如出一轍。這程序順利地進行着，一九三三年十月，蘇聯政府便向東京提出强硬而無效的交涉，但蘇聯旣不能向日本軍閥或東京方面得到滿意，便把日軍和「滿洲國」文官間正式和秘密的文件，公諸於世，披露全部計劃，這些文件是從勝任的間諜工作得到的。日本軍閥不但因蘇聯突然表示堅決而錯愕，且對於莫斯科已知日方每一行動，更爲震驚，便立刻停止其程序，終乃同意向蘇聯購買這鐵路。但這愚蠢的陰謀是造成日蘇政府間摩擦的最重要的因素之一，從那時起，蘇聯政府公開地運用勢力，阻撓在華的日本軍閥，這是日本最耗代價的謬誤。</p>
<p>蘇日關係的惡化，結果使蘇聯方面在邊界大興防禦工程，日本軍閥因此不但保有泰西守舊人士的若干同情和聲援，並得因此繼續擴張其軍備，以「蘇聯威脅」爲藉口，時時向本國要求巨款，以充經費。然而，即在那時之前，滿洲的耗費已在繼長增高之中。日本軍閥和他們的代理人，爲使他們在滿洲的冒險行動得到民眾贊助起見，謊稱這一着可以解除日本的經濟困難，這話只有無知者和易受欺騙者才相信，因爲日本最重的經濟負担，便是那些軍閥自身，另加爲他們以前的冒險行動而發行的國債和其他不斷的經費。但軍閥的諾言，不久便被他們自己所發的言論證明虛偽，侵佔滿洲不足兩年，軍閥便開始解釋道：解除經濟困難，不是目前之事，不過將來總有一天會實現的，最不幸所謂「將來的一天」，要的是用日本資金去投資」，這種「投資」將來的收穫，是不可限量的。越推越遠，而經費的增加，却年高一年，政府所發行的公債數額，日增無已，日本的政府銀行和其他投資家都奉了政府之命，同在滿洲從事「投資」。</p>
<p>滿洲支出浩大</p>
<p>一九三三年，日本官方發表的滿洲軍費是一萬六千二百萬日元，——都是出於日木納稅人私囊的，一九三六年，此費增至一萬八千三百萬日元以上，且仍在增高中。敷設軍略上的鐵路，（軍閥告日本投資者說：這些鐵路會「開發地方」，而產生利息。）和購買中東路，二事所用的經費，至一九三六年止，每年平均支出在二萬萬日元以上。南滿鐵道更逐年發行新債券，——包括鐵路以外的許多事業的經費在內，滿鐵的直接投資，至一九三六年三月底止，共達八萬萬日元以上，其中鐵路佔三萬零五百萬日元，煤礦佔一萬二千萬日元，船港等佔一萬萬元日元。然而，滿鐵雖已攫奪了滿洲的中國各鐵路，並操其「管理」權，所得的利潤並未像「投資」一様的增加，事實上，滿鐵的利潤，已自一九三二到三三年的六千一百萬日元，跌到决年的四千三百寓日元，在一九三五到三六年，還未恢復到五千萬日元。（按照貶値的日元計算）。</p>
<p>實在有許多條鐵路，甚至在侵佔之前，便無利可穫，因爲有些鐵路——華方和日方的都有——的敷設，是供軍略上或競爭之用，而不是直接爲了經濟目的，但日本的「軍事經濟家」還把無利可圖的發展擴展到其他方面的「投資」。滿洲的劣質之鐵，倘加經營，唯有損失，因爲外國的鐵價比滿洲廉得多哩，可是軍閥却自設鋼鐵廠，耗費巨資，從事鍊鋼，並從事開採石油，它的耗資，也比舶來油高得多。爲力求經濟利用這種滿洲油起見，軍閥不得不樹立油的專賣，而檳絕外國的競爭。軍閥所抱的經濟目的，是在他們自己的勢力範圍內增加軍需的生產，以代出較低的價格向海外購買，這就是滿洲「經濟開發」的目標。那費用都出於日本的納稅人，除去其中的一部份，將傳到他們的孩子，使受更難支持的重負</p>
<p>一九三〇年，銑鐵的產額，在安山是二十九萬噸，本溪湖八萬五千噸，到一九三五年，前者幾乎增到四十一萬二千噸，後者增加更多，每噸銑鐵和外國鐵的價格比較，至少損折白金十元，尤其是用資本一萬萬日元，設在安山的昭和鋼廠，可算得以更澈底方法消耗日本納稅人的金錢於軍事用途，却沒有可能的獲利希望。第一廠在一九三五年五月開設，已加擴充，鋼產逐步激增，因爲鐵砂質劣，所以華工工資雖廉，依然虧折。</p>
<p>軍閥諾言虛偽</p>
<p>日本軍閥在侵略的早年吿訴日本工人說，滿洲不會成資本家的開拓的塲合，而將由軍人替日本整個人民的利益支配着，具有使日人得到職業，和從事殖民等等的大機會。當然這種諾言和向投資家所發的諾言是一樣虛偽的，軍閥所創立或擴展的新鐵路和新工業，只用有限的日人充技術人員·經理·或少數特殊等級的僱員，但大批工人部是華人，因爲他們所得的工資，還不及日本工人在國內所得的半數。爲使這些無利可圖的事業，力求撙節起見，不得不僱用工資極低，幾乎過着半人類標準的生活的中國工人。</p>
<p>日本勞工不但很少在滿洲得到職業的機會，並且確實在國內遭遇到滿洲華工的競爭。除了軍閥的大企業之外，還有日本資本家爲牟利起見在滿洲所創立的紡織等事業，因為華工較日人工資低廉，才能獲利。因此日本本國的工業便遇到設立在滿洲的工業的直接競爭，以致日本工業中的工人不得不和中國工人相競爭。雖則一九三一到三二年和其後數年因爲日元貶値，日本輸出大增，然而這幾年來整個的發展，却使日本的工人增重困苦。</p>
<p>工業虧折原因</p>
<p>軍閥爲何不能使滿洲獲利的一個原因，是由於情勢遠非他們所能控制之故。大豆原是「滿洲繁榮」，奉天人員成為鉅富和大增軍隊的基礎，它的出口業已慘跌，日本軍閥若稍具世界經濟發展的智識，當已知道這種出口品正在低落，並且難免續跌，實際上，在一九三一年，細心的觀察家已在世界市場上和日本本國淸晰地見到這種徵象。滿洲對外貿易數字，大可證明日本軍閥在這方面已大失所望，他們所攫得的不是日益獲利的，而是日益低落的經濟，他們攫得了張學良的大兵工廠，飛機，鐵路，銀行等等，還有他的鉅額私產是事實，然而這巨富的資源已漸枯竭了，滿洲的經濟不但已空虛，而且確實是每况愈下。</p>
<p>多年來中日兩國在貿易上都是入超很巨的，只有很例外的幾年，是出超的，然而滿洲和中國其他部份有顯明的相反。多年來這廣博區域的輸出品，却較輸入爲多，滿洲的輸出，在一九〇八年不足四千五百萬元，一九二九年增至幾達五萬萬元，而從滿洲運往中國其他部份的，還未計入，這也是很重要的。滿洲最重要的出口物，便是運往泰西各國和日本以及中國其他部份的大豆，和大豆的製品，滿洲是東亞唯一有巨量剩餘輸出，而貿易出超的大區域，大豆不但使奉天統治者的私產和軍力大增，就是更南的，尤其是山魯省移居奉天的華人，也多賴以生活。</p>
<p>大豆銷塲沒落</p>
<p>大豆和大豆製品的輸出，一度曾年達三萬萬元，在它佔中國輸出總額的百分之二十三，而這種特殊的輸出，幾乎全數來自滿洲，可供食料和工業之用，日本是它最重耍的市場。更重要的，是利用豆餅作日本農田的肥料，以補人畜施肥的不足，但自十年前發現較豆餅爲廉的化學肥料，日木設廠製造日見增多後，她所購滿洲豆餅的數量，便日見减少。同時泰西各國在本土所種的大豆，也見日增，自一九二七年起，日木减購滿洲豆餅，（日本是最重要的購主。）它的出口便激减。豆油輸出在一九二七年曾達最高額，至此也見低落。在銀價跌落的幾年中，因爲中國貨物極廉，大豆的輸出未見起色，直到一九二九年，才達到最高額，其後又開始低落。大豆售價雖達到空前的低廉，然而因爲泰西的經濟不景氣，銷路依然沉滯。</p>
<p>這是當日本軍閥侵佔滿洲時的局面，他們完全不知關於中國關於世界茶至關於日本自身的商業趨勢。滿洲的戰事，使交通梗阻，和失去一般的安全，百事更見惡化。</p>
<p>直到一九三二年，滿洲對外國和中國他部的貿易，出超很大，雖有世界的經濟危機，一九三〇年滿洲對外國的輪出，還達四萬三千萬華幣以上，較入口多一萬萬元。查滿洲對外國和中國的輸出，合計總額，幾達華幣六萬萬元，入口却不足四萬六千萬元。據細心的經濟家說：實際上的貿易額要大得多，因爲中國海關不照每年價格的變動而修正數字，所以它的統計常低估出口折價値，因此，一九三〇年滿洲輸出　的實在價値約八萬八千萬元。</p>
<p>然而滿洲在被佔以後，便有很大的變動，一九三一年的貿易數字表不滿洲輸出共値滿幣（與華幣同價）七萬三千九百萬元，入口三萬四千四百萬元，出超達三萬九千五百萬元。一九三二年的數字表示輸出共値滿幣六萬一千六百萬元，輸入三萬零一百萬元，出超已減至三萬一千五百萬元。一九三三年的輸出已減到滿幣四萬二千四百萬元，輸入却躍至五萬一千六百萬元，根本自入超變成出超。一九三三年的入超九千二百萬元，一九三四年增至一萬四千五百萬元，此後入超的趨勢繼續不已。滿洲已不是出超而是入超激增之區，現在它已不生一利，而且入不敷出，只得向日人民今天增稅，明天發公債，經彌補不足（未完）</p>

<h3>租界當局重定　食米新限價　即自明日起一體實行　白粳廿元客秈十六元</h3>
<p>上海豆米市塲、自經租界當局規定限價取締投機後、因投機者停止操縱、囤戶出籠、且新米登塲期愈近、市塲價格猛烈回跌、今租界當局與米業團體討論結果、重定限價、準明日起實行、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>新米將到</p>

<p>新定限價</p>
<p>關於米價問題、公共租界曁法租界當局與本市各米業團體代表、討論結果、規定自本月十七日起、無論整批零售最高白粳市價、每石不得超過國幣二十元、最高客秈、每石不得超過國幣十六元、中决一律分別遞减、如買賣雙方有超越此限價者、概不認爲有效、並應據實報告捕房、以憑取締、上述各節、將在上海荳米業公會市場、於明日（十七日）晨張貼佈告、通知各米商一體遵照、</p>
<p>民食無憂</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向米業團體探悉、上海租界以內之存米、依照七月十日之第十五期報告、爲三十四萬四千九百零二包、雖較上期减少五萬五千包、但足能供滬市民食一二個月之需、且產地存米、紛紛運滬、听以滬市整個民食、決無缺乏之虞、又昨日河下南港帮運到二三號、車輪貨自常州·同里·等處運到二千四百包、聞下星期內尙有大批存米、由產地運滬出售、惟市塲交易、依然淸淡、</p>
<p>仍將抑减</p>
<p>豆米業公會委員陳子彝·朱子香·市場管理委員符前耕·米號業公會主席張念萱、曾於本月十三日與公共租界工部局副總辦何德奎等、會商穩定市場米價、以維民食案、當決定依照上次限價、抑低一元、準本月十七日起實行、聞此後如來源能增加、決再逐漸抑低、又市場今日星期例停、明日開市時、即依照新限價交易、荳米業公會已定明日下午三時舉行執監委員聯席會議、届時提出報吿新限價、</p>

<p>抄獲軍火</p>
<p>昨晨四時、日軍特務部派日籍職員十餘人、會同公共捕房刑事科中西探、分乘汽車赴法警務處聲稱、查得福履理路三一六弄十七號門牌內、藏有危險品與某種事務有關、請協助查是拘、當由西探長派中西探偕同按址馳往搜查、結果抄出盒子砲十一支、手榆十支、均係新式樣子、並獲廣東女子陳秀珍、年二十五歲一口、並無男子在內、遂將陳女連同軍械帶回法捕房暫押、命候偵查核辦、又英文大美晚報云、法租界警務處應日憲兵部之請、於夜間連續搜查事、仍屬疑團、因所傳抄獲手槍二十一枝（內軍用盒子砲十一枝）之說、今（十五日）晨未能獲得證實也、據法租界警務處聲稱、夜問分別加以搜查者、不下十五次、並未抄獲文件、亦無被捕者、至今日拂曉、搜查吿畢、</p>
<h3>進口商對印棉　取銷訂購契約　强化外匯管理限制提存後　進口商於外匯需要將激減　沿海省際貿易激增</h3>
<p>上海入超激增、致黑市外匯需要、亦因之增加、政府當局、有鑒於此、除由外匯平衡基金會調整黑市匯價、授命外商銀行維持六便士半水準匯價後、茲復强化外匯管理、限制提存、此舉對平衡貿易穩定外匯管理、已收成效、今後進口商於外匯需要、當可趨减、聞印度棉花訂購契的、取消者已有多起、未來交易、更將激减、</p>
<p>棉麥輸入數量驚人</p>
<p>江海關本年一月份輸出　為三千餘萬元、以後各月無進步、但輸入迭有增加、一月份輸入三千九百萬元、五月份輸入七千二百萬元、幾已增加一倍、造成輸入激增及入超原因、爲鉅量棉花洋麥等輸入、五個月來棉花輸入計達五千九百餘萬元、超過去年同期六倍之多、而小麥烟草亦有大量輸入、木年首五月輸入計一七·六五叫千元、烟草輸入一七·四二七千一元、超過去年同期七百餘萬元、</p>

<h3>工部局發表六月份　工業槪况　絲繭原料缺乏堪虞　物價指數又復增高</h3>
<p>據工部局管理工廠事務股昨發表六月份本市工廠概况、茲摘綠如下、</p>
<p>增設新廠</p>
<p>據該股發表、六月份請求在西區設廠者、雖不若十月之多、其中較注意者、爲養化鉛、及醋酸鉛製造廠二家、廢絲紡織廠二家、羊毛及棉紡織廠各一家、罐頭廠一家、玻璃廠二家、新開工經視察者四十六家、以織造廠爲最多、尚有若干製造廠、因不能在他處獲得原料、故在東區開設分廠、計有帽廠·養氣製造廠·摩托配合廠·皂廠·寬緊帶廠·及消毒棉花廠各一家、</p>
<p>絲料缺乏</p>
<p>新繭因交通阻碍、致運滬者寥寥、春季時新辦之繅絲廠四十六家、其營業前途、殊堪憂慮、加之浙江封鎖、所有浙省之新繭、均難來滬、以致來源僅持蘇省一區、實有供不應求之槪、故各絲廠若一旦存繭繅完、勢將减少工作、廢絲廠亦同様蒙受影響、又有用外國原料之工廠數家、業已减縮工作、據稱最近之財政辦法、或將影響小少工廠維持其以前生產能力、</p>
<p>工人待遇</p>
<p>有某織造廠、訂定下午半小時休息辦法、工人可離開工作、喧鬧聲浪暫停、工人可藉此休息、廠方設雨淋浴卅具、可按時免費沐浴、屋頂隔離室內溫度减低六度、同時並將工人工資、增加百分之八、追算自六月一日起、並購備米糧、轉售工人、價比原價低四元、尙有數家工廠、均按照生活費之增加而調整工資、有一家織造廠、將按時工資增加百分之十二·五、按件增百分之十三·五、惟工作須滿意、須試行八小時工作、其生產率與十二時同、故按件工資、已增至百分之二十、</p>

<h3>金融　日商法幣充足　外匯出遠期進現貨　外銀行供給較旺市象回鬆　沙遜與華商趁賤仍在結進</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、俱無更動、英美匯增市、雖油洋行德士古·美孚及亞細亞等結款繁盛、無如英行匯豐始終供塞維持、且其他外行、因鑒英鎊續昂、故對於美匯、亦賣意轉濃、是以情况遂呈英平美略回硬之象、惟七八月份期貨、稍有變化、呈先鬆後略回軟之勢、初因隔昨午後、市上所傳國內某公更動謠言、業經息滅、故扒風頓戢、蓋買戶均懷觀望態度、加以中外各銀行供塞甚殷、故市勢頓告鬆硬、本月份英金會硬至六便士四三七五、美匯亦曾鬆至十二元半、八月份英金亦硬達六便士一五六二五、美匯亦曾喊高至十二元、嗣以西商沙遜與華商投機家趁賤扒吸、市象遂見回軟、惟結果尚稍軋硬、據聞日銀行曾吸進現貨、而了結期貨、蓋近又在淪陷區域獲得法幣所致也、午刻外行曾互套英美匯兌、價爲四元六角八分二厘二、半天交易尚旺、至港匯因外行賣意較濃、故稍見軋長、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期長〇六二五、遠期漲一二五、紐約銀價未更、倫敦生金小半便士、匯況英對美大三毫、對滬跌一二五、對法長一生丁、美對英·對滬·對法均平、中央掛牌各匯如舊、（已停止申請）、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金六便士五六二五、美匯十二元七五、較之前收、均無榮辱、開後外行賣意頗住、尤以期貨更濃、且上日扒者、因聞隔昨市上之所傳、某公更動謠言、業經消退、是以多懷觀望、故市勢現貨極平、而期貨即見步硬、計洋行曾吸進某行現貨美匯爲十二元七五、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉依然免微、此後華商各銀行賣意亦濃、爭先力塞期貨英美兩金、故當時雖西商沙遜及華商投機家互相吸納、無如求不敵供、故狀况愈趨硬化、計外行與華行相繼塞予沙遜及華商本月份英金六便士四三七五及四〇六二五、並本月份美匯十二元半及四三七五、繼而沙遜又購結華行八月份英金六便士一二五、同時八月份美匯買方亦還過十二元、後某方塞予同行安達本月份美匯十二元半、將近午刻雖油洋行突起扒風、但以銀行賣意始終不淡、致爲狀尚平、計油洋行亞細亞扒進匯豐現貨英金六便士五六二五、同時美孚及德士古亦相繼購結美行現貨美匯十二元七五及七八一二五、後有利賣予荷蘭八月份美匯爲十一元九三七五、時外行又互套英美匯兌價爲四元六角八分二厘二、其時港匯因外行賣意轉濃、據聞現貨賣價已回高至四十四元、但未聞成交、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金穴便士五六二五、美匯十二元七八一二五、本月份英金六便士四〇六二五、美匯十二元四三七五、八月份英金六便士一二五、美匯十一元九三七五、結果較上日現貨、英平美略硬〇三一二五、本月份英賤〇六二五、美亦鬆〇六二五、八月份英硬〇六二五、美鬆一二五、港匯照銀行賣價亦回硬一二五、午後週六無市、茲將半天做開交易錄後、</p>
<h3>港電闢謠　現金晨開暴跌　終以外匯期貨回軟　乃呈易漲難跌之勢</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、僅有上午半天行市、下午因外匯週六無市、故亦經同業議决、停市半天、唯昨上午形勢、初時市勢傾疲、有直向下瀉之象、繼乃緩緩步高、晨開因上日場中所傳、國內某公更動之謠言、業因港電闢謠、加以外匯期貨步硬、且現鈔貼現價格復衝出百元關外、故買方均多審愼觀望、致一時缺乏維持、竟猛落至二千六百零六元開盤、嗣以錢兌業代散戶趁低力購、兼某銀號又代外行吸納、致市象逐漸轉穩、午刻因外匯期貨回軟、及港帮搜購、趨勢更堅、昂達當日高峯之二千六百十九元收盤、然結果則尚軋跌十一元、半天交易的五百兩光景、銀樓飾金先跌後漲、終則掛小一元、海關金仍平、中英純金等略向下降、</p>
<p>烚赤價軋跌十一元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因聞上日場中所傳國內之某某謠言、業經香港來電吾認、是以人心頓虛、加以又聞外匯期貨步硬、故賣風陡濃、允以現金號脫售之心益切、且其時買方多袖手旁觀、致市勢傾疲、九時四十分開市竟猛落二十四元、銀樓帮賣予錢兌業五十兩、價二千六百零六元、開後證券帮與錢兌業各吸進現金號二十兩、價均〇七元、時買方趁低吸收頗力、且某外行亦有納胃、市價頓見步高、瞬息回上三元、銀樓帮進錢兌業五十兩、及某銀號（代外行）進現金號五十兩、價均十元、機而某銀號又進錢兌業十兩、價十一元五角、後錢兌業進現金號十兩、及錢兌業互做二十兩、價均十三元、時錢兌業吸收更力、未幾叉抬高二元、錢兌業進銀樓帮三十兩、價十五元、機之另一錢兌業又進金號四十兩、又同業五十兩、價均十六元、將近午刻、忽聞外匯期貨回戰、加以港帮納胃殊佳、市勢愈堅、再抬高三元、某銀樓（代港帮）進證券帮及錢兌業各五十兩、均十九元爲午收價、午後因値外匯週六無市、故經同業議决亦停市半天、結果若照午收價二千六百十九元、較上日則軋跌十一元、半天十三元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價二千六百二十五元、收進二千六百十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、據詢均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金亦先跌而後回</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、初均未更、迨至十時因烚赤晨開猛落、故亦掛小二元、後至十二時十分、因烚赤回高、故乃亦回漲一元、計大同行改懸二百六十五元、新同行爲二百六十三元、收進二百五十七元、</p>
<p>英純金回縮半便士</p>
<p>十四日倫教電、英純金因英錄堅昂、每盎斯遂縮半便士、計退達七鎊八先令五便士半、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價、亦降低至一千二百十一元九角、掛牌海關金仍平、計二元三角九分六厘、上海標準標金價亦隨跌四角、計一千二百零七元二角、</p>
<h3>英印銀價微升</h3>
<p>十四日倫教電、銀市印度少數買進、投機家進出兼營、市面平、收盤後仍平、印度照掛牌價稍來復出、但進者觀望、大條銀近期續長〇六二五、遠期續升一二五、紐的銀電、美現貨未更、又孟買銀電、印銀市况平靜、現貨漲三安那、七月昂二安那、八月祇大一安那、成交單共計百張、</p>
<h3>外匯套利者日多　貼現昂達百元關外</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、升騰驟銳、每千元之貼率、再高至一百元關外、蓋邇來外匯近遠期離開日巨、套利者更見踴躍、收買現金與外幣均需現鈔、籌碼枯竭、致激起昂勢、上午初即高至一百元、繼更步高達一百〇六元、近午始見回低至一百〇二元、下午又曾高至一百〇四元、不久復漸步低至最後爲一百元、較之前日高起五元七角半、至錢業公會拆息、呆定如故、早午兩市仍一角八分云、</p>
<h3>英美金鎊　大漲小回</h3>
<p>昨日英純金跌半辦士、英美匯兌未動、本埠外匯洋行結款甚殷、西商與投機家納胃頗旺、外銀行供給暢達、市况英平美鬆、英匯仍爲六辦士五六二五、美匯爲十二元七八一二五、較上日回鬆〇三一二五、週六下午無市、烚赤開盤、因匯票套利者眾、遠期轉趨鬆動、客戶紛紛拋塞、做二千六百零六元低盤、銀樓業現金號趁低吸納、市况堅挺、漲達二十二元、午收爲十九元、下午交易未做開、結果較上日回跌十一元、外幣英美金鎊、需要未殷、且烚赤回降、市况趨弱、英美金票、交易頗盛、惟匯票遠期趨鬆、供給較暢、價俱回降、香港票法郎票等、交易未盛、俱呈穩定、日金票供求勢均、晚市仍爲九角九分半、朝鮮票需要呆滯、市况疲弱、晚市爲八角五分半、公會交易稀、仁泰出長泰進美金票四百元、利通出長泰進美金票二百元、昨日市價、英美金鎊各降二角、英金票降五分、美金票降一分五厘、其他各幣俱未更動、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債再跌　外股待機</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況趨勢復走小面、可見新聞儘管宣傳、而在正式部文還未頒佈前、有鑒於宣傳之不可盡信、市上並有某辭職謠諑、多方愈有戒心、隨時出籠、緩而不急、故市况現大範圍之升降、自七月四日開市後、先漲三日、旋又回跌三日、再回好二日、咋又轉跌、震盪無定、足見人心之忐忑、一般工於心計精於計算者、以爲此决本息即照所傳付給匯劃辦法、丙種亦祇合四十五六元、昨日經過開盤、甲種即跌數角、至九元邊際、旋即敲破、乙種亦退入五十元大關、交易仍屬不振、買方如同順鴻康以及大通十一號進胃毫不踴躍、賣出則有天生潤利永豐松茂及四十一號爲數亦不湧旺、而疲勢並無轉機、故結果甲種驟小一元、餘亦小五六角、成交總數亦祇的三十餘萬元而已、茲列簡明表於後、今日行市、或以英國國會堅主對華信用貸款增加款額、及所傳辭職尚未證實、債市或許爲所支持些須、亦未可知、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交紗布交易所股五十股、價爲三十七元正、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市　人心正待較佳之消息、即此方之國際關係問題之發展、但目今不幸一無面員、市面續形下降、投機者全無方針、而投資者不抱樂觀、須待時局進展、近日倫敦及紐的市氣較佳、尤以紐的爲更佳、但不能準確到新政局勢有時可無生枝、是以本市難以追隨其後、橡皮出於意料、在此時期美國六月份消費較五月份增高二千九百噸、共計消去四萬七千三百噸之多、存底低下一萬一千八百噸、現計僅存十八萬一千八百噸、此爲一九三七年八月以來最低之存底、</p>
<p>倫教英商遠東各公司股票本月十四日（週五）掛牌行市、稍見跌落、匯豐銀行英倫註冊股跌半鎊、價爲七十八鎊半、開平煤礦不記名股跌三便士、價爲十七先令六便士、其餘不動、</p>
<p>倫敦中國外債本月十四日（週五掛牌行市、上下檔各債券均無變動、英倫實貨求售、中法美金（有印）二千鎊、（即美金一萬元）售價三十七鎊、照市撳三鎊、善後借款英發一千鎊、售價三十一鎊、照市　一鎊、又德發有印一千鎊、售價二十九鎊、照市撳三鎊、</p>
<h3>中法美金公債　暫停付息</h3>
<p>一九二五年中法五厘美金公債、發行於民國十四年五月廿七日、總額爲美金四三、八九三、九〇〇元、原定期限二十三年、每年抽籤償還一次、至民國三十七年一月十五日止、全數償淸、至今除已還本十四决外、尚負票面爲美金二二、一三六、六五〇元、咋日爲第二十九期息票支付之期、計應付利息美金五五三、四一陸元二五、經向經付機關、中法工商銀行探詢、據云因基金尚未撥到、暫行停付、</p>
<h3>四行儲蓄會分紅　半年盈餘達四十萬　會員紅利一厘二毫</h3>
<p>四行儲蓄會、係鹽業·金城·中南·大陸·四大銀行合資設立、首創存款分紅制度、辦法優良、信用卓著、爲我國唯一之儲蓄機關、自民國十五年錢新之氏任該會經理後、業務更加發達、儲金總額最高曾至一萬萬元、儲戶十餘萬、現聞該會今年上期結賬、盈餘國幣四十萬零六千餘元、會員紅利仍爲一厘二毫、二年定期儲金、速同保息七應、共爲八厘二毫、與二十七年份相同云、</p>
<h3>紗花　廣幫辦胃飽滿　紗市回挫　日紗獨漲四元</h3>
<p>連漲三天之紗市、昨則轉入超趄不前之途、蓋以採辦不斷之廣西·雲南兩帮、辦胃業有飽滿之象、且輪船已解纜開往、須待各貨運達地頭、消化以後、再當有轉批交易也、因之本日實際生意大爲减少、同業人心軟弱、二十支雙馬由四百九十元回跌至四百八十七元、至於客帮僅港帮買進粗細紗三百四十五包、其他帮口絕少胃口、市面益覺平庸、鈔票貼現率復昂、惟有一部份心理、爲遠期外匯復縮、心思仍屬看高也、根本問題、還在實銷上作圭臬也、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、同業大家看好而一律喊高、又說匯票軟縮、因邇來南部需要良好、開價二十支雙馬外棧貨漲二三元、爲四百九十元、棧單價爲四百八十四·五元、此價開出以後、詎料廣帮採辦不旺、且都喊無交易、市價忽然回平而挫、中途同業中鑒於實銷不動、亦束手坐視、故無大變遷、成交甚稀、迨至收盤二十支雙馬外棧價爲四百八十八元、棧單價爲四百八十二元、廠方無大舉動、查半日成交統計僅七百八十七包、行情二十支雙馬·牧羊與上日無甚軒輊、惟特金城跌二元、十支粗紗跌二·三元、今日有棉紗一百二十件運香港、三百八十五件運海防、又明日有二十件運烟台、五十件運厦門、四十件運香港、九十五件運廣州灣、一百件運北海、一百二十件運天津、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>同行三七五內地六七上日成交一八〇香港三四五統計九六七</p>
<p>日紗市面續見良好、大概以遠期匯票趨縮、引起投機商心思活動、遠期買者尤夥、市盤帶高、但實需交易並未十分發達、二十支月琴現紗價爲三百九十八元、漲四元之譜、</p>
<h3>傳美押放會　將受領原棉押款</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市昨日繼續靜寂、開盤因利物浦及孟買來電及一部份多頭了結而略降二三磅音、六月份國內棉花消耗略見進步、已增爲五七八、四四八包、惟同業均靜待美政府之出口津貼細則之正式公佈、暫時均抱觀望態度、因之棉市更呈呆滯之狀、棉價未能起色、昨日印度連同預測跌二羅比、埃及跌十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、聞金副方面之押放委員會日內有成立希望、惟對各種原棉、申請押款者、須經扞樣評騐估價等手續、並每萬取手續費若干云、詳情日內即可公佈云、</p>
<p>本棉交易依然靜寂、廠方因法幣頭寸匱乏、難以購辦、且有一部紗廠之原料、吸收充足、目前亦無亟亟採辦之舉、成交愈形冷落一般矣、但同業雖有互做買賣生意、然成就之額、亦屬微乎其微、惟同業進白洛去二百件、價爲一百〇二元、匯劃送廠颶風消散、蘇北航行業巳恢復、本日到通州花四百三十包云、</p>

<h3>小布廠　停業索隱</h3>
<p>小型布廠從淪陷區遷來和島上新創的、眞如雨後春筍、然而會幾何時、因棉布通入內地的運輸路綫、逐漸隔絕、客帮實需種種窒碍之故、相率裏足、小型布廠的資金、本極薄弱、何况大多數具有投機性、那堪經此打擊、大概每一布廠的生產工具——布機——、多則兩三百台、少僅百餘臺、所織布疋、以白坯組平、細平、斜紋等爲中心、每台每日夜、產量最多能出四十碼長的粗平布三疋、（細平·斜紋則較少、的兩疋多）照此每臺每日夜、須準備經·緯·紗原料五十磅、百台的布機、原料紗的準備、一實夜的總需量、便要五千磅了、四百二十磅折算一件、約需紗十二件左右、（二三百台布機的、就需三四十件紗了、）總値是五六千元、如此一個月的運轉的原料流動金、就需十五六萬元矣、如果棉布生意好、那是不成問題的、有了二三萬元的原料流動金、售出成品、買進棉紗、這樣川流不息、儘可機器運轉、如果製成品因市面呆滯及種種掣肘而一堆積、那麼做五六天的工作之後、就祇好關車停工、再停工下去、便要週轉不靈、迫使停業、所以近來小型布廠而沒有雄厚資力的、停工减工、日有所聞、即以很有資力的而論、（有機三百六十台、）現在也在减工停工之間呼吸急迫了、（龍駒生）</p>

<h3>豫園救溺添造闌干</h3>
<p>上海邑廟之豫園，樓台亭閣，無所不備。且疊石爲山，鑿地爲池，又有溝渠，引水滿中，環繞各處，並建橋梁，以通往來。特是池深而闊，除九曲欄干外，其餘各處，均未建設。兵亂之後，相傳池有溺鬼，往往出迷行人。前數歲尚不常見，今歲入夏以來，居然數出。端午前二日，夕陽甫墜，行人尚夥；且萃秀堂前，隙地寬暢，向在其地說書者，正在開場，環立以聽者，不下百人。忽有一人，年尚未壯，直向萃秀堂前，綏步而下，至水中央，則載浮載沉矣。見者知其有異，呼集聽書之人，力援之上，詢其何以如此，伊茫然不解。其中有識其居在廟左近者，方送之歸。其餘諸人，仍聽書如故。乃未逾半刻，又有一人　　。　人復　之是，細詢其由，其人並未脣迷，答曰：「予聞湖心亭前，有人連呼予名者，且視池中有路無水，是以由此而前，初不虞其爲池也。」前牛痘局諸君，捐資設立路燈，以指示行人，即爲免誤溺而設焉。查園中各處，皆爲各業公所，如萃秀堂爲荳業公所，點春爲花糖行業公所，內園爲錢業公所，今又新建酒業公所。其他尚有布業錢糧各項公所，較决者尚有鐵業等公所。統計大者七處，次者亦有數處。預計建造闌干，需費四百千文，則每業攤派，不過數十千文。每業每歲燕會之資，亦須數百千文，今擬少加節省，即以此項捐爲建造闌干之費，則救人一命，勝造七級浮屠矣。</p>

<h3>利用假期去體驗生活</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>眼前，每憫小朋友都度着署假生活了。暑假對於你們一定感覺到愉快，不用再一邊抹着額角上的汗珠，一邊吮着毛筆在課堂裏默書。不用再瞪眼望着黑板上繁難的算題，拼命轉念頭。老師們亦不再要你們限期交課卷了。無論如何，你們暫時脫離了學校規則的束缚。自由自在地在家裏玩着，雖然你們的父母也不免要教你們做些功課，寫字或溫書，我想：你們決不會忌憚父母更甚於老師。</p>
<p>可是我很不贊成你們把幾十天的暑假盡在玩耍中消磨掉。反之，你們正大可利用這個比較長一些的假期去體騐各種生活，也許你將會感覺到比讀書更有興趣，更有益處，譬如小朋友的父親是機器工程師，就不妨要求他領你去機器廠裏看看，你一定會發現許多機械上的奇妙和工人們的刻苦情形。譬如小朋友的父親是一家商行的經理，也可以要求到他辦公房裏去觀光，你就不難知道，生意買賣是怎様做的，生意人須有怎様的禮貌和才能。……其他當然還很多，母需一一舉出了。</p>
<p>也許你們要發出這樣的抗識：「我們還正在求學時代，爲什麼要呌我們做這種本份以外的事呢？」這完全是你們小朋友思想簡單的，天眞無邪的口氣。但你們要知道；這樣呌你們去體騐生活，正爲着使你們獲得書本以外的各種智識，帮助你們增進學業。書本只是死呆的照片，現實生活才是一部活動影片。小朋友；活動影片一定要比死呆的照片更有趣，更看得　些吧。</p>
<p>結尾，我要提出一個例證；我有一位朋友嘗在一家報館裏當過校對員。後來他就進了新聞專門學校，各種論文在同學中他做得最好。因爲他把在報館裏工作的經騐都寫進去了。而其他同學只能在書本的範圍內兜圈子，小朋友，暑假正是好機會，大家利用一下吧。</p>
<h3>美國兒童學執筷子</h3>
<p>— 明初</p>
<p>紐約唐人街的一家中國菜館，最近舉行中美兒童叙餐會，許多中外人士也到場參觀，情况很爲熱鬧。這决叙餐，是美國醫藥援華贊助程序中的一種，當日參加的兒童共有五十多人，都由他們母親陪伴着，經過二小時方才盡興而散。據負責籌備的朱夫人說，這决叙餐會，不外二種目的。第一，就是希望籍這集會，促進中美兩國人士的諒解和相互間的友好。第二，就是所有收入，悉數購買醫藥用品，捐給中國難民，减輕他們的疾苦。在進餐之前，朱夫人曾發表簡潔的演說，討論中國的文化，還把美國文化來比較中國的文化，然後請到會的，每人認捐若干，以示發起。</p>
<p>當然有許多美國兒童還是初次嘗到中國菜的滋味，當侍者一盆一盆端上菜餚的時候，他們都表示很寄怪的様子。所吃的菜，有燕窩雞湯蛋捲，蔬菜炒杏仁雞，栗子燒鴨塊，蝦仁蛋，糖醋排骨，白飯，杏仁餅，什錦菓子，中國茶，最使這些兒童發生好奇心的，就是那雙長筷子，經過解釋之後，他們或者把筷子敲着桌子，或是架橋和做其他的遊戲，然後才試用筷子進膳。有幾個中國兒童跟朱夫人一樣也在向美國兒童解釋用筷的方法，可是那些美國兒童，一試一試，終不知如何是好，祗得模仿着旁人勉强使用，然而不久，他們又雜用起刀叉來。也有一個美童先用叉叉了食物放在筷子上，然後送進他的嘴裏去。這様的集會，使到場的中外人士，都覺得很滿意。</p>
<h3>說地</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>——明兒避難記之二十五——</p>
<p>一路過了洋溪，港口，而淳安，這些都是浙江的鎭和縣，他們更越過了無數的急流小灘，如萬馬奔騰排山倒海的直瀉下來，隨着便是一路風平浪靜，四周沉寂得甚麼似的！三五小烏吱吱喳喳的唱着，那淸朗的歌聲，似乎安慰他們飽嘗了風浪的辛苦，又好像歌頌他們的勝利。可是好景不常，不多一刻，又是一陣山崩地裂的水吼聲，那怪可憐的江出船在江心中掙扎着。這樣的一灘又一灘的過去，地勢也隨着一層高一層。船夫們憑着他們結實的軀幹，堅强的魄力，和瘋在的水浪周旋着，最後戰勝了它們有限的蠻力，不過船夫們所付的代價也相當的可觀—混身的血汗。他們終年的在江上東西往來，受盡了風霜雨雪的打擊，歷遍了千山萬水的行程，這樣飄蕩在水面上的生活，委實是太辛苦了。</p>
<p>「現在這條河仍舊是新安江嗎？」這時江山船又過了一灘，船老大滿臉大汗，晚去了衣服，只剩了一層內衣，在船頭上休息—當然是抽烟。明兒從驚恐氣氛罩住的艙裏踱出來，吐了一口長長的混濁的氣，不知不覺的和船老大搭訕着。</p>
<p>「是的，不錯，這裏是新安江。」船老大暗暗地覺得有些厭惡明兒的多問，便胡調般大聲的回答着。但這也難怪明兒，因爲他還是破題兒第一遭打從這裏經過哩。「爲什麼這江有這麼多的灘呢？」明兒老是喜歡「打碎砂鍋問到底」的問個不休。</p>
<p>「你是學生子，還不曉得嗎？我雖沒有讀過書，倒是很明白，這是上流高的緣故，你瞧四周都是高山，便是一個證據，水從高的地方冲下來，怎麼不急呢？而新安江恰在傾斜的地方，便有很多的灘了。說到這裹，有一件有趣的事講給你聽：你可不要奇怪，這裏的地勢比了在杭州的三層大樓還要高哩。」船老大也是滔滔不絕的說得很起緊。明兒聽了船老大如訓話般的說了一大篇，心中很有些不服，便跟着駁他一句：</p>
<p>「你怎麼知道這裏的地形比了杭州高呢？你又不生千里眼，難道能望見杭州嗎？」「這也很容易明白的，你想，我們已過了十幾個灘了，每過一灘，便升高三四尺左右，這様一算，我的話也可相信了，對不對？」船老大提出了眞憑實據，害得明兒啞口無言。幸虧這時明兒的父親從艙裏出來，他不是來調解的，因爲他一天到晚的坐着，眞是無聊，恰在明兒和船老大爭辯得激烈的一霎那，他走出艙來，便打斷了他倆的辯論。</p>
<p>「船老大，到屯溪還需多少日子？」明兒父親問着船老大，「先生，還要四五天左右，明天可以進安徽省了。」</p>
<p>明兒乘着這個機會溜進了船艙。他暗暗地感謝父親給他一個下台的辰光。「不然，怎麼好呢？那船老大不是好惹的。明天要進安徽省了，到底和江蘇浙江有些什麼分別？哈，明天睢個明白！」</p>
<h3>“換我們的新裝”</h3>
<p>— 小　作</p>
<h3>從硬幣到紙幣</h3>
<p>— 春綠</p>
<p>從前我國通行的貨幣，是用銀和銅兩種金屬鑄造的：銀幣有一圓·半圓·雙角·單角等四種；銅輪有當十銅元和一文錢兩種。但是把銅幣換銀幣，或銀元兌銀角，都不能以十進法計算，須依市價折合，非常麻煩。</p>
<p>民國二十四年，因爲美國收買銀子，所以銀子的價格很高，一般貪利的商人，便把銀子運出去賺錢。這様一來，我們國內流通的貨幣就少了。貨幣一少，各種貨物的價格就下落，工商業的利益也隨之减少，所以停工的工廠和倒閉的商店很多。我國政府，就在十一月四日實行新貨幣制：把中央·中國·交通三家銀行的鈔票，定爲「法幣」，流通使用。所有現金，集中在「發行準備管理委員會」中；不准使用。</p>
<p>我國的貨幣，除了上述的法幣作爲本位的貨幣外，二十五年一月十一日，國府又規定用鎳幣和銅幣做輔幣，都以十進法計算。現在通行的鎳幣有廿分·十分·五分的三種；銅幣有一分和半分兩種。都是中央造幣廠鑄造，中央銀行發行的。</p>
<p>抗戰以後，銅允輔幣，因侵略者的搜括，幾乎在市場上絕跡了。目前法幣一元，僅兌一分輔幣六七十枚，還不易兌得。所以一般人以民都盼望國家銀行發行一種分頭輔幣分，像浙江省通川的浙江地方銀行　幣券一般，可以通行全國。那末；我們的貨幣，便從硬幣完全變爲紙幣，也就是從用金時期進化到信用時期了。</p>
<h3>外蒙古</h3>
<p>— 經田</p>
<p>外蒙古在我國的北部，照地理區域劃分就是蒙古高原；面積很大，但是大部分是荒涼的戈壁大沙漠，祗有北面一部分，水草雙　，雨量充足，很適宜畜牧，所以外蒙古最大富源也就是牲畜。外蒙古的北方，便是俄國的西伯利亞，因爲外蒙古在地理上與俄國接近，所以其間的關係也特別來得複雜。</p>
<p>自從日俄戰爭之後，俄國在東三省的勢力大受打擊，因此不得不另找侵略的對像，於是便看中了近在嘴邊的外蒙古，便在辛亥革命的那一年，俄國乘滿淸混亂的常兒，指使外蒙古的活佛，宣佈獨立，稱大蒙古國，俄國便借提助獨立的名義，和外蒙古訂的，得到種種特擭，於是外蒙古遂成了俄國的附庸，民國成立以後與俄國幾經交涉，都沒有結果；直到民國四年才簽訂了中俄蒙恊約，承認外蒙古有自治權，而俄國和外蒙古承認我國在外蒙古有宗主權，幾年來中俄蒙的糾紛，就暫時解決，民國六年俄國大革命爆發，俄人無　東顧，於是便停止支持外蒙古的自治政府，同時叉有白俄的入侵，形勢險惡，於是外蒙王公便請中國政府予以保護，政府乃派軍出征外蒙古，亂平後即駐軍庫倫；同時外蒙古的活佛與王公覺自治之非計，便在民國八年自動取消自治，而成爲我國正式的一個行政區域，但是到了民國十年，外蒙古的俄國留學生和一輩野心的王公，有所謂蒙古國民黨的組織，並且借了俄國的後援，擊破庫倫，廢去了活佛，成立蒙古國民政府；民國十三年蒙古共和國正式成立，其一切政治組織制度完全模倣俄國，並且外蒙古在名義雖說獨立了，但一切政治軍事財政外交大權，都被俄人所操縱，而受其支配，於是外蒙古又差不多成了俄國一部份，但是俄國恐怕因此而妨害中俄兩國的國交，便在同一年內，與我國訂定一種協的，再行承認中國在外蒙古的宗主權，從此之後，外蒙古便在這様半獨立的狀熊下，一天一天的生長起來，一切政事軍備交通農產工商業等都跟着俄國向前猛進；同時外蒙古對於伊的母國—中國，始終保持親善和痛癢相關的態度，並且成爲中俄間的一座重要的橋樑。</p>
<h3>畜生道中（九）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>當時那些獸畜一面伴着彭其走，一而嚷着道：瞧瞧「我們應讓他去開開眼，瞧瞧我們的本領」！於是有一羣聰明眼睛的水獺，臉色黑黑的，也像諾克斯那麼很有光彩，立時領着彭其到它們住的所在去，做給他瞧瞧怎樣利用它的利齒來砍倒，或　起那水面上淌來的木料，原來每年春季，美國森林中所砍下的樹木，往往丟在河中，任它順流而下的。水　們截留下來，伏着它們的技巧，也會造成一座座的住宅。彭其正在參觀時，近邊水中有一條小小的水蟲，也來請他去參觀它們的住宅，雖是造得很小，而也顯得它們一様是用過一番苦心，並且一様是很有技巧的；所有的牆壁，都用碎石砌成，五顏六色的，甚是好看。</p>
<p>在另一條小溪中，有一尾模樣兒很強健的小絲魚，正繞着它那桶形的巢穴，游來游去，原來它是擔任着看守的職務的。它驕傲地來邀請彭其參觀它們造巢的成績。</p>
<p>彭其看過之後，他的興趣，卻被那螞蟻們所造的泥城吸引了去。只見走廊曲折，巧妙無窮料不到小小的生物，竟有這樣的奇蹟。此外他又參觀了大黃蜂們的房間，很佩服它們的勤勞。正在這時，忽從海邊一隻蠣黃殼裏送來了一封請柬，請彭其去參觀那海蟲的住宅，那些住宅的形式各各美觀，卻各各不同，每一家每族各有各的作風；雖說平時必須用了顯微鏡才可看清，而在這畜生道中，卻只須用着肉眼，就可以看得清清楚楚的。</p>
<p>一會兒請柬更紛紛的飛來了。那善於交際的　嘴島，邀他到遠處的樹林中去參觀它們聚居一的城市；還有那場撥鼠也來歡迎他到它們的村子裏去，每一頭鼠都坐在它的小屋子上，懇切地迎候上客的光降。還有一羣白嘴鴉，請他去參加一個莊嚴的集會。在每一棵樹上都放着步哨，等待他一步步的走近。</p>
<p>一頭蜘蛛，似是一位精明老練的機械工程師似的，很願意指點彭其結網的方法。他忙着說道：「你留心聽着，譬如你現在已準備好了一切，要開始動工了。第一你得揀好了一個適當的？位，決定在那一點上裝設你的第一根絲。當然咯，你的身體裹是藏着一團絲的，可不是麼」</p>
<h3>蟻戰</h3>
<p>— 承明</p>
<p>在蟲類中堅於團體組織，而善於作戰的是什麼？就是螞蟻。它們是公有制度下的勤勞者，它們個體的力量雖薄，但集團的力量却勝過一切，它們更有齊心一致的抵禦外侮的勇敢精神，它們才是最優良最合理的合羣生活者，願小朋友們能引螞蟻做生活的模範。關於蟻的戰門情形怎樣？很少見於紀載。</p>
<p>記得在倫敦的動物園裹，却曾有一次劇烈的蟻戰，爭持四日夜，才決定勝負。觀者如堵，報紙也逐日登載其事，鬧得滿城風雨，當時有一位博物學家陸波克爵士，親自目擊，記載最詳，現在把蟻戰的大槪情形，略紀如后：</p>
<p>在動物園裏，先時已有一族蟻在溪畔居住了，後來有一族新來的，遷居在對岸。但溪水中隔，不相聞問，便無由發生爭端。有一天，好事者的園丁，在溪上架了一根木棒，因此兩巢的蟻便有接觸的機會了。</p>
<p>這時，恰巧舊巢有一個蟻，行到溪旁，看見了木棒，便緣木棒過岸，忽然給新巢的蟻發見了，在圍攻合殺之下，便不得生還。</p>
<p>當這惡消息傳到舊巢來時，登時起了騷動，奔走相告，大家都顯着憤激的情狀，但絕對沒有擾亂的熊度。過一會，便遣十多個勇敢善戰的過橋窺探敵巢的虛實。這時，新巢的蟻，都入穴藏匿，舊巢的鑰，不得詳情，便折回來報告，這時照人的觀察，它們定在開了一個軍事會議吧？幾分鐘後，全體戰士，魚貫而出，擬渡木棒，直衝敵巢，大有「滅此朝食」的氣概。同時工蟻沿途銜沙作　，以爲進戰退守的策略。</p>
<p>木棒的那一端，已有新巢的兩個在守望了，看見敵人來犯，一個即奔回報告。幾秒鐘後，亦整隊而出。兩方戰士，大約有幾千個。</p>
<p>兩軍旣已接觸了，口嚙足抵，兇猛異常，奪鬥殺敵，前仆後繼。有的斷足折頸而死在沙場上；有的被迫而溺死於溪水裏。一連戰了四日夜，舊巢的蟻軍，才不支退却，過木棒時因地位太狹，擁擠不堪，跌死於水裏的，也不可勝數呢！當戰事繼續到第二天後，中間曾作休息兩小時，雙方互通使訊。照人的推測，大概是在商議停戰條件，可惜和議不成，戰端又開了。</p>
<p>小朋友，你們看，它們有行軍的計劃，有作戰的方法，和人類有什麼分別？，而舊巢的蟻，不肯屈服，眞是雖敗猶榮呢！</p>

<p>無疑地現在已到火　高張的盛夏季節，自然少數高貴的士女們可以踱進凉爽舒適的飲冰室，沉浸上幾個鐘點也不妨事，反正是有閒階級者啊。只有廣大的勞苦羣眾，爲了生活，終日奔命，不論在時間上經濟上統統不允許他們進飲冰室去沉浸。因之有一般熱心的善士，爲了想替那輩勞苦的羣眾，减少一些渴熱，所以紛紛沿路設置凉茶桶，免費飲用，嘉惠人們，實非淺鮮，不料近來常有少數頑劣兒童，不但不做些有益於人羣的事，反在幹着損人不利已的無賴勾當，如常去嬉弄凉茶，有的用凉茶洗滌手臉；有的以凉茶隨意酒人，有的把茶桶開關開了跑開，任其源源地流在地上；有的三五孩童用鉛罐之類的東西，各盛凉茶，相互作戰；有的用不潔的布角紙頭去塡塞開關口等，種種可惡的頑劣行動，不一而足。總之：對嬉弄者絲毫無益；於使用者實有大害。這種事實，屢見不鮮，用特借本刊篇幅，謹告本刊讀者，務希讀者諸君隨時見情規勸，多方宣傳，務希共同維護施給凉茶，嘉惠尋眾的本意。反正嬉弄凉茶，賽在是損人不利己的一種無恥勾當，實在有傷人格的。</p>

<h3>請儘先僱用難胞</h3>
<p>— 學文</p>
<p>難民救濟會介紹組</p>
<p>現有各種技術人材</p>
<p>並將增設平民工廠</p>
<p>訓練班正教導難胞</p>
<p>這兩天為難民勸募夏令衛生經費的播音義賣等等，似乎很熱鬧，可見上海人熱心的人還是很多，他們在自己舒適的環境當中，總算都能抽出一點餘力來幫助難胞。</p>
<p>但是除了消極的「募款」「捐助」把數萬難胞養在收容所裹，似乎不是一個辦法，因此，在全上海每一個難民救濟會裹，都有一個生產教育的設施計劃，希望在有計劃的指導之下，使「身無長技」的難民，在短時期以內，能够學習一種專門技術。</p>
<p>但實際上，在難胞中，確也有本身過去曾受過中高等教育的，比如西愛咸斯路國際收容所中，就有三位大學生；而在上海難民救濟會的辦事處裹，也有很多職員，由難胞中提拔出來的，可見在收容所中，確實不乏可用的人材，如使我們能去選擇，他們也許就是工作效能最優秀的份子。</p>
<p>共劃分為三組</p>
<p>上海難民救濟協會為了使難胞獲得一個較為安定的生活，特地設立了一個職業介紹組，專門登記各難胞的專門人材，並且負責向各廠介紹。</p>
<p>記者昨天到廣東路九十三號救濟會，去訪問他們的善後處，由教育處長陳　謨先生和記者詳談職業介紹組的組織經過。以及現在進行的情形：</p>
<p>救濟會為了使難胞成為一個直接的生產者，特地設立了三組：第一組就是職業介紹組；第二組是疏散組；第三組是生產建設組，</p>
<p>關於第二第三組，我們暫且擱開不談，現在讓記者根據陳　謨先生的談話，專門來談談「職業介紹組。」</p>
<p>難胞均可登記</p>
<p>職業介紹組成立是在去年十一月裹，成立到現在已有半年，剛登記的時候，足足有兩千多人，直到現在為止，已有三百多人介紹出去。</p>
<p>他們一成立就和工部局的工業推廣部，成立一種合作方式，向各工廠進行。</p>
<p>他們舉行登記，並不限制救濟會的難胞，就是別個收容所，如有難胞自問有專門技術，儘可以到廣東路會所去登記</p>
<p>登記的手續很簡單，而且也並不收取任何費用，只要到會所中填一張表格就可以了。</p>
<p>這種登記表，呌作「求業登記表，」會中收到了登記表以後，於是到收容中實行調查工作，看表格中所填的各種事實是否確有其事。</p>
<p>每月津貼一元</p>
<p>經過調查以後，再作進一步的考核工作，由會中派員對登記的難胞實施考核，如認為考核及格的，在考核表上詳細注明後，這一個救職難胞的身份才算確定。</p>
<p>如使在這時間中，職業已介紹成功，那麼會中必先予以種種切實的指導，並填具志願書。</p>
<p>有了職業的難胞，在開始一個月到三個月中間，算是試用時期，這短時期以內，僱主暫時僅供給膳宿而不給工資。</p>
<p>救濟會為了獎勵有職業的難胞，特別在試用期內津貼車資一塊錢，這一塊錢雖然數目很小，但這種獎勵的意義，却是值得推行的。</p>
<p>必須加緊訓練</p>
<p>以去年四月底統計的結果。登記人數有七百零四人，佔統計表中最高的數字的，是紗廠男女工人，計有一百十八人，其次是烟廠男女工作，有五十人，其餘按次序而下，小販四十人，印刷卅三人，商店職員卅一人，其他有銅匠，有鐵匠，有廚司，有裁縫，人數最少的是水匠等等，種類不可謂不多。</p>
<p>以五月到七月，這兩個多月中間，登記人數是二百廿六人，以紗廠女工及錫箔廠女工為最多，一個是五十人，一個是四十人。其他有襪廠工人廿人，印刷工人十五人，專門技術人材，有卡　司機一人，鉸鏈廠男工二人，其他私人僱員雖佔八十人，但並無特殊技能。</p>
<p>由這兩張統計表看，第一次的統計表裹，還能平均地顯示出，收容所有各種各式的人材，而在第二張統計表裹，却看出無一技之長的難胞，却佔了三份之一以上，所以，對於現在的難胞，必須加緊訓練的</p>
<p>設立平民工廠</p>
<p>根據前面我和陳先生的談話以及統計表中顯示出求職難胞大多數無特殊技能，所以在生產建設組裹，已決定設立一規模很大的平民工廠，並已決定由俞佐庭，項康元諸先生負責進行，我們希望這計劃能趕快實現。</p>
<p>其次在教育處以下，又設立了一個工作訓練組，在這個組以下，開了好幾種專門技能訓練班，如無綫電，肥皂，化學工程等等，有一個月畢業，有的半年畢業，這班訓練班第一期雖然尚未畢業，但在這種有程序有計劃的進行之下，對於難胞，實在比什麼教育生產的方法都簡捷得多。</p>
<h3>陳克明女士近作</h3>
<h3>女彈詞人物誌</h3>
<p>— 沈宥</p>
<p>女彈詞之以「色」著者</p>
<p>在當時亦四人，為王幼娟，徐雅雲，黃藹卿，陳佩卿。持平叟論云：「幼娟乃麗娟之妹，才遜姊而貌勝姊，藝則埒姊。徐雅雲即徐寶玉之女，性雅靜，貌端妍，寡言笑，有閨秀氣，歌亦清婉。藹卿，佩卿，均皆妍好，並已嫁矣。藹卿，余嘗見其携示寸許小竹管玩之不置，嫣然而笑，如嬰兒然。天真爛漫，泃是可人。佩卿深於情，與施生有　臂盟，旣而多金者購之，母已許矣。施生泣，佩卿亦泣，母從其志，卒反金而嫁生。」文中所述佩卿事，並未盡，蓋發展之結果，實為悲劇也。「海陬冶遊附録」記之最詳，文云：</p>
<p>佩卿姓陳，初名小寶性趣聰慧，貌尤秀美。同慶里姚瑞蘭，教以歌曲，姬夷然不屑學也。……小東門外聚美軒，每逢七月，凡說書者，無論男女，咸會於此，各奏一藝，茍不赴會，則不得入書塲。又向例先至先奏，奏過之曲，毋得重唱。姬至最晚，所習之書，又皆為人所先說，幾至無以登塲。歸而壹志於音律，不兩月，藝大　，名亦大噪。凡　滬上名花色藝兼擅者，當以姬為首屈一指。……</p>
<p>此是言佩卿藝事，其論　似較持平叟僅以「色」取者為高。至其身世，則與施生事，同於叟所述。顧叟僅述至佩卿與施生結合為止，往後發展成悲劇，未之及，想係文成較早之故。「海陬冶遊所録」續記之云：</p>
<p>……初以為鳳凰之和鳴雲路，翡翠之戲影　茗不當也。兩年間連舉兩子，人皆為　慶。無何，士也罔極，二三其德，施生於外，與徐小寶相　，兩月不歸。姬貌豐而體弱，亭亭如初日芙蓉，產後失調，兼以抑　，不數月，病入膏盲，欲招施生一見訣別，竟不可得。恨恨呼施郎負我　沒。施生歸，於此可知其略，蓋彼個人史實，即是一部絕妙彈詞也。幼娟事，不可考，邗江詞客有贈詩云：「幼娟絕世聰明甚，淺笑輕顰更可憐。弱質何堪太消瘦，亭亭莫使立風前，」然實泛作。免痴道人「接紅雪詞題二十四女品花圖」（申報，）曾喻之為「海棠，」為「醉女，」評之為「銀燭炤時腮有暈，玉環睡起夢如烟，」顧給予者，仍不免為糢糊印象。王　記其姊麗娟云：</p>
<p>麗娟王姓，生長虞山下。姓情閑雜，風致蹁躚。其一種清矯拔俗之槪，有令人凛然難犯者。…籍隸琴川，瑯　舊族，亦因避兵後流離至此者。幼失恃，其父素不務業，有任姓老媼，携之來滬，梳洗縫　，悉倚賴焉。客居無以為生，遂從師度曲，藉資餬口。……</p>
<p>若幼娟果係與麗娟為親姊妹者，其所遭際，當亦類此。徐雅雲，邗江詞客亦有贈詩，且較顯明劃出其輪廓。詩云：「鳳目蛾眉徐雅雲，亭亭如鶴立雞羣。吳娘暮雨蕭蕭曲，重到江南再一聞。」其　則亦難考。「海上羣芳譜」（一八八四）卷二，有徐雅仙傳，謂雅仙為姑蘇人，本姓朱，良家女，習南詞於徐寶玉，故從徐姓。明眸皓齒，肌膩骨柔，素面淡妝，神清膚潔，　國夫入之流亞也。　不知「雅仙」是否為「雅雲」之改名。又「詞媛姓氏録」著者雲　夢　廠主有「金縷曲贈徐慶雲詞史」云：</p>
<p>雛鳳年矯小，看當塲珠喉，銀甲聲聲入妙。　把金釵籠寶髻，已是工　妍笑。况阿母徐娘未老，本擅詞壇蘇張口，喜今番有女　同　。鶯舌囀，競偷巧。　雲英昔日驚鴻貌，　琵琶盈盈憨態，娥眉淡掃（謂姊雅雲。）姊妹花枝渾不辦，一樣遠山青肖。我亦算情塲潦倒，閒向風塵評聲價（近輯詞媛姓氏録將成，）記芳名添入烏絲稿。擲筆起，獨長嘯。</p>
<p>詞中狀雅雲，與雅仙亦頗相似。且藉此得知雅雲尚有一妹，名慶雲，亦可兒。黃藹雲，捨持平叟有論外，已無可考。「上海南北竹枝詞」云：「一曲琵琶四座傾，佳人也是號先生。就中誰是超羣者，吳素卿同黃愛卿。」不知「愛卿」是否即「藹卿」也？（八）</p>
<h3>魂歸離恨天</h3>
<p>— 如華</p>
<p>“Wutluering　Heights”</p>
<p>「魂歸離恨天」是英國女作家白朗泰氏的名著。在這支慘絕人寰的悲劇中，多少反映了當時階級觀念的牢不可破；而另一方面，也說明了每個人應該以自己的事業為前提。譬如自小鄙視海克立夫的辛萊，終於因為自己的隨落，將產業售給受過自己侮辱的海克立夫。可是卡珊的「離開我，爭取你的前程」這句話，却恰恰相反地加強他們的熱戀，而海克立夫的後來離別卡珊，也是失戀後的忿憤，所以，我們所看到的當然祇是一支慘絕人寰的悲劇了。</p>
<p>「魂歸離恨天」是用倒敘法的，不知是否為了忠於原著，在電影上我以為這並不是最好的方法，這樣它减削了最後高潮的力量，而每一節戲用老嫗愛倫的說明，也使全劇的情緒不能緊凑地聯　起來。</p>
<p>自然，導演者威廉威勒處理每塲戲的成就也是不容忽視的。第一：他把辛萊和海克立夫兩個人的性格是抓住了，一個是憑藉着自己的地位而傲視一切的；一個是為了戀愛而忍受着一切痛苦，等到失望時，才變態地任信起來，前後都寫得非常生動。第二：他三次寫海克立夫和卡珊在山巔相會，而寫三個不同的環境，第一次是他們幼時幻想的歡樂，第二次是苦痛中的安慰，第三更進一步的熱戀，前後呼應，感人甚深。第三：在卡珊在大雨中追趕海克立夫，及最後卡珊死在海克立夫手臂中的兩塲戲，他的細膩，動人，該是全片最精彩的兩塲戲了。</p>
<p>曼兒奧蓓朗的卡珊，在撕破衣服，追到山巔去；大雨中的奔走；病榻上的含笑而逝，都努力。勞倫奧立佛的海克立夫，他的堅強，忍耐，任信，每個轉變時期的性格，都能明顯地把握着。</p>
<p>攝影和音樂也得力不少。前者如開塲時的大風雪，及古屋中的陰沉，卡珊和海克立夫採麥時的明朗，與最後他們望着白雲深處的舊遊之地，鮮明可愛。後者如海克立夫敲破手指時的大雷雨，加強了海克立夫的憤怒；卡珊臨終時那低沉的音樂，加強了悽凉的空氣。</p>
<h3>陳蝶野鬻畫</h3>
<p>— 賀天健</p>
<p>士何以貴，食其力者為上，其他次焉，士何以貴，克成其業者為上，其他次焉，富與貧無論矣，而世獨重富有資財，視成其業而食其力不務富有者為微，於是朝專一業而不能富，則暮而易他途以謀除其貧，士不專學，商不專業，工不專技，農不專　，百庶惶惶未克終日，此大弊也。猶不之覺吾將何說，有人焉，業已成尚未以事其生，雖與朝主而夕改者不同，顧其果亦難免不專之弊，吾故曰專其業而食其力者士之上也。陳子蝶野，為余十年老友也。工山水花卉而不食其藝者，聞余說而興焉。謀於余，將何以為則。余曰適耳，遂定例扇　每葉十五元，屏條每尺十元，堂幅倍之，立軸十五元，此未為也過。論畫之值，古貴於今，未趙明誠見徐熙畫，索價二十萬千，猶曰賤，李營邱畫一幅，論值百萬，今日畫例，每尺數十元，世人已驚詫，何其相異之甚邪。畫人之在今日，由此可見並不重視，然而一國之文化，繪畫實為首要，世不重視，由於何因，姑不必論，專其事者，亦不須計及此也，但行其志成其業了矣，陳子旣以此為務，夫其持躬守心，蓋可嘉尚焉。陳子於山水，力持元人尚意之說，故其筆墨蒼渾軼宕，有子久澤民山樵方壺之勝，思翁石溪其入元之先容也，花卉得白陽八大　之了神髓，陳子於國之名山大川歷之　逮八九，書卷羅胸，殆亦萬餘，氣息非凡，自不偶然，當其懸例倩畫之始，　為一言之介。</p>

<h3>平劇爲什麽不算歌劇</h3>
<p>— 荀墨</p>
<p>我贊成「洋化」，但並不主張「全盤」；我也贊成提倡中國本位文化，但又不主張保守與拘泥。一國文化不應使其孤立，但也不能喪失獨特的地方。洋化的朋友乾脆請他外國去，泥古的前輩衹有請博物館。對於平劇的看法，我也一貫如此。</p>
<p>曾有人不容許中國平劇列入世界歌劇之林，堅持這種主張的人會舉出許多洋理論來把平劇批判得不能列等，然而我不能無疑。</p>
<p>論歌　平劇的咬字，發音，行腔，使調，抑揚疾徐，不僅有嚴格的法度，而且要在嚴格的法度中唱出韻味，爲什麼在樂理上找不出價值來？一定要像唱外國歌那樣把嗓子拉直，直中帶抖，真說不出什麼理由。幾年前我聽過杜庭修先生用合乎聲樂原理的唱法，在外行聽來，就是唱外國歌那樣唱法，唱過空城計「我本是……」的一段，恕我不客氣的說一句，委實找不出一些平劇固有的韻味，這真是多此一舉了。</p>
<p>論舞　平劇的身段，步法，一舉手，一投足，同樣也有嚴格的法度，而且要在嚴格的法度中使出變化，爲什麼在舞理上找不出價值來。一定要像跳外國舞那樣翹翹大腿，變彎手臂，旋旋身子，真說不出什麼理由。平劇講身段邊式，就是講合度而美觀，至於水髮，鬍鬚，水袖，厚靴，以及踹蹻，多種不同而繁難的技術，爲什麼就一無足述呢？</p>
<p>論音樂伴奏　固然平劇塲面簡單，不及西洋歌劇複雜。然而這也有其獨特的風格。即以胡琴而論，兩根弦子，拉出多種調門，襯托着喜怒哀樂各種不同的唱腔，爲什麼拉梵啞鈴的就被稱爲音樂家，而拉胡琴的就貶爲「教化子」。這種心理，真是自輕自賤之尤。再如，小鑼，大鑼，金鼓，鐃鈸，獨奏或合奏，襯托着戲中各種情調，又爲什麼毫無是處呢？</p>
<p>論動作表情　平劇中自娃娃至老年，自帝皇至平民，自文官至武將，自閨秀至碧玉，形形色色，各有千秋。劇藝高超的，一顰一笑，一言一動，無不有其規範，亦無不合乎情理。即如花旦的表演思春，何嘗遜色於外國歌劇中最熱烈的愛情表演，（請注意：外國歌劇中的接吻與擁抱，那是要被中國社會目爲淫蕩而加以禁止的）。難道一定要像外國歌劇中抖着聲間大喊「我愛你」才得過　麼？</p>
<p>至於舞台裝置和化妝服飾，如果不一定要中國戲劇和外國戲劇一模一樣，那我還是說自有其獨特的風格，更自有其社會背景，因篇幅限制，這裏不能詳論，再譬如武戲的技術，試問看過外國技術團的軟硬表演的，平心而論，中國的是否不如外國的？</p>
<p>平劇是中國的民間藝術，我們並不諱言還很幼稚，需要根據固有法度，迎合時代潮流，加以改進，這我絕對承認而且主張。要說平劇毫無價值，不容許列入世界歌劇之林，那我堅決抗議，堅決反對。</p>
<p>爲什麼平劇不算歌劇呢？</p>
<h3>故都梨園快訊</h3>
<p>— 燕雁</p>
<p>博有時代藝人之譽之評劇名旦喜形運氏，自在平出演後，聲譽日隆。其新劇梁紅玉與「韓世忠」，轟動已久，平地人士，欲一飽耳目之福者，亦望眼欲穿矣。按斯劇排成已久，其所以遲遲公演者，一則因立體佈景製造耽延，二則因考古服裝，裁製逾期，三則因配演者之唱作，迄未熟習。近在新新戲院首次公演，上座滿堂，所到皆一時知名之士，喜彩蓮如斯受人歡迎，誠始料所不及也。</p>
<p>魯殿　光之小生泰斗程繼先氏，自脫離程硯秋秋聲團後，久未出演，日前早有復演之訊，直至月之十日晚，與李洪春合演臨江會於長安戲院，劇前有楊寶森王泉奎之打鼓罵曹，朱桂芳李之疆范寶亭之青石山，於蓮仙之荷珠配。據聞上座尚佳，以程　先之年歲，尚組班出演，魄力不小，老興亦復不淺也。</p>
<p>坤伶鬚生王座孟小冬氏，自拜余叔岩爲師後，耽心襌寂，蟄居不出，久未露演，茲聞靜極思動，有於最近之將來露演一塲之訊，此事已有眉目，大致可成事實，地點係在新新戲院，惟劇目尚未確定耳。</p>
<p>平市各界聞人再度約請名淨金少山與奚嘯伯張君秋三人合作演唱　戲，　目擬定爲二進宮，於月之十三日出演於新新戲院，前塲特約宋德珠周瑞安佟德新等合演盤絲洞，宋飾蜘蛛精月霞仙子，有驚奇出手</p>
<p>名旦荀慧生之十三妹，早負盛譽，通塲飾何玉鳳，乃子令香，從王瑤　習此劇，亦飾何玉鳳，因此有人煩其父子合演，已於月之十日在吉祥夜塲上演，以令香飾前塲之十三妹，後部之張金鳳，慧生飾後塲之十三妹，金仲仁飾安學海，蔣少奎飾鄧九公，朱斌仙飾賽西施。</p>
<p>戲後前經高盛奎親援之前部「六國封相」，公演後，成績頗佳，深得平地人士所歡迎，後部亦經排練完畢，月之九日出演於廣和畫塲，仍由李和曾飾張儀，趙金年飾蘇秦，劇情服裝，較前部尤爲精彩。又戲校自李洪春丁永利相繼辭職後，諸生應學之一切武劇，即由傅德威與王金璐分任教授。</p>
<h3>楊小仲改編「湖上的悲劇」</h3>
<p>— 銀笛</p>
<p>田漢昔年名作搬上銀幕</p>
<p>過去南國社會有一齣著名的話劇演出，是田漢手編的「湖上的悲劇」，後來卜萬蒼在明星影片公司，曾把他搬上銀幕，似乎就是楊耐梅主演的「湖邊春夢」。</p>
<p>現在楊小仲也看上了這一個田漢的劇作，正在動手改編爲電影劇本，據說簡單的本事已經新華公司當局審閱批准，楊小仲的新作「琵琶記」已攝製完成之後，就預備開拍此片，片名擬定爲「倩女遊魂」，但遊魂兩字不甚妥當，也許將改爲「倩女離魂」。</p>
<p>此片女主角，楊小仲有請陳雲裳担任的意思，陳雲裳原定十五日左右可抵滬，現在是「因事展期」，大約一是二十三日就是二十四日，准到上海。</p>

<h3>麒麟童傑作之一—打嚴嵩</h3>
<p>— 馮宗英</p>
<p>信芳之拿手傑作，爲海派之戲，如追韓信，清風亭，別窰，路遙知馬力，掃松下書等夙稱擅長，凡此類戲。做工煩重，唱工則次之。回憶數年前觀信芳之一齣傑作爲打嚴嵩，特重提之。</p>
<p>打嚴嵩一劇，信芳之應龍，配以少山之嚴嵩，頗有紅綠相襯之妙。信芳口白清爽，緩慢，每個字眼都咬得非常真確，至「嘉靖爺，坐江山……」幾句，唱時絕無夾雜花腔之類，不如連良之「漂亮　生」，以花腔而博觀眾之彩也。但惜其嗓音沙噪，顧沙中却帶勁且真，亦乃精也。應龍至嚴府與門官週旋，斯時做白俱佳，彩聲不少，但五寶之門官，喉嗄音低不若富祿及長華之流利暢達，既入府以「東角門下施一禮，西角門下打一躬……」參見太師，迨「…將身站在丹墀境，問我一言答我一聲」幾句唱時，走到台邊，雙頰緋紅，怒目舉視，滿面咤叱，二手向後一插，袍角蹺起，兀立不動，若一真發怒之人，後宣旨上殿二六板一段中，一口氣連貫唱完，尤以「罷罷罷」三字，音忽高忽低，抑揚輕重，似抽刀斷水，音懸而停，使台下觀眾，掌聲如雷。少山之口白，間多鼻音，唱中「三六九日……」一句轉音特快，金嗓洪且響亮，不愧黃鍾大呂之音也！後開山府，打嚴嵩，信芳與少山之對答口白，流利清爽至　打嚴嵩時，少山之受打如出乎本意，真情，信芳之憤舉，若真出洩其氣，一報往仇，至此已達劇情最高潮矣。劇終入幕之時，太師以小喉嚨向應龍道聲「謝謝儂」的蘇白，到引得滿堂大笑</p>
<p>方今少山正紅極北方，信芳留申出演各種長劇，二人何時能重合演，如此佳劇，吾人得能幾回逢，思之慨然。</p>
<h3>即將放洋之北平李麗（見七日本刊）</h3>
<p>— 焦超攝</p>
<h3>溜冰術（八十二）</h3>
<p>— 蓮君琦珍合編</p>
<p>練習法之一，先雙足着地向後退，行動時漸提一足而使行動之足在鞋之外邊用力。練習法之二，用向後環行法，如向右退，則將左足交于右足之前，與右足之右，並使落地時，落于左鞋之裏邊。將身之重心輪流左右移，左足用裏邊，右足用外邊，則速力自增，練習至右足能獨行即可。</p>
<p>四·內退</p>
<p>左足立穩，提右足，足趾須向裏，足跟越向外越好，左膝大屈，推動時稍帶彈性，同時右足立即落地，且須直接落在裏鞋邊，練習既久，左足之離地自然能輕而和緩，臀須隨主腿主肩連旋，內退之開步，姿態本不雅觀，惟客膝能大屈而帶彈性，亦能使其雅觀。</p>
<p>內退時身之位置第一式，客腿客臂客肩隨弧綫行動方向，且客腿在所畫弧綫之上，主肩留在後，兩肩自腰部起，稍在圈外，頭對主肩與行動方向。</p>
<p>身之開始旋動至第二式，約在半途，客腿客臀在後，肩仍照舊，頭則現向中心，當換足時，肩則一轉而過軸綫，右肩移至前，此法能使左足開步時，身之位置與右足開步同，主膝須常大屈，尤其在開步之前，庶能有力，以上是用身之位置第一第二兩式。第三式主肩客腿均在身之前面，客肩客臂在後，頭對來處看，此式內進及搖轉之後用之。第四式客肩臂腿臀均在後，頭對行動方向，且在圈綫內，高級溜冰如（甲）內退反三字轉之前，（乙）外進三字轉之後，（丙）內退環結之後均用之。</p>
<p>內退開步尚有一法，即右足用鞋之裏邊，先交在左足前一推，然後即將左鞋外邊推動，此即所謂交腳法是也。按此法辦主足先推，有犯開步須自立定始之定章，故爲比賽時所不許，但在平時溜冰極爲有用，因可借力不少也。</p>
<p>內退練習完全可照外退法，即（甲）雙足着地退後行，（乙）用環行法，但不提左足而提右足，且用左足之裏鞋邊行動，當客足過主足時，果將主足用力挺直，即能加增速力。</p>

<p>所以當時大家都議論紛紛，說碧雲的失敗，就是壞在三隻白虎頭上，其實這全是迷信的話。近許多年來，梁華亭接辦中和，與硯秋訂有長期合同，只要他在北平出演，就由中和享受專利，硯秋由法回國，聲譽陡增，適巧蘭芳又遠居海上，北平的旦行髣髴是以他爲首席，座價竟售至一元七角，而營業鼎盛，無形中却讓梁華亭大獲其利。硯秋自從海外歸來，腦筋一新，當然不忌諱什麼白虎黑虎，可是梁氏的冒險嘗試，足見他也很有魄力，現在聽說他已獲利十餘萬，儼然小康之家了。反觀徐老四則已潦倒不堪，數年來除在關外尚能立足外，平市中簡直已把他的名字遺忘了。徐老四畢竟不如程老四，事業之成敗，全在個人之是否上進，這與白虎台是絲毫沒有關係的。</p>

        <h1>1939.07.16</h1>
<h3>The Shanxi War Situation is Developing: The Southern Shanxi Chinese Army Advances Towards Yuxiang and Jiexian, Achieving Numerous Victories; Japanese Troops at Huaxian, Longkou, and Baisiling Have Suffered a Complete Rout; Japanese Troops Landing at Chenglingji Have Been Repelled with Heavy Casualties</h3>
<p>Xingji: For the past half-month, the focus of the Shanxi war has shifted to the Shangdang area. Following the unsuccessful Japanese offensives against Zhongtiao Mountain and Lüliang Mountain last month, the enemy began in early this month to use the Pinghan, Zhengtai, Tongpu, and Daoqing railways as their bases, drawing troops from various locations in Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan to launch a large-scale nine-pronged attack on southeastern Shanxi, attempting to encircle and annihilate the Chinese army and the Chinese guerrilla bases. The first prong, consisting of over 10,000 Japanese troops from the Jiaozuo and Bo'ai areas in northern Henan, including the division and the main force of the Dianzhi unit, has been advancing north along the Bo-Jin Highway for days. The Chinese forces are holding defensive positions in the ten mountain passes east of Lanche Town, north of Bo'ai, inflicting over a thousand casualties on the Japanese. In the Battle of Baishan on the seventh, 500 Japanese soldiers were killed. The second prong, consisting of an additional Japanese division of approximately 20,000 troops from the Handan area along the Pinghan Railway, with an advance force of 4,000 to 5,000 men, advanced eastward on the fifth through Wu'an, divided at Jichengbo, Yuling, and Yetao, and were intercepted by the Chinese army near Dongyangguan. The third prong, consisting of a unit of the Japanese Independent Brigade, numbering 3,000 to 4,000 men, advanced south from Pingding along the Zhengtai Railway. After capturing Liaoxian on the third, the main force turned towards Yushe. On the sixth, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on Shixiaobo (west of Liaoxian), engaging in a ten-hour battle, killing 300 Japanese soldiers, and seizing the opportunity to recapture Liaoxian on the seventh. The fourth prong, consisting of 20,000 men from the main force of the Japanese Division along the Bai-Jin Highway, captured Qin County on the fifth with a large force and Wu Township with a smaller force. Fierce fighting is taking place west of Qin County, along the Huting area. The fifth prong, consisting of 2,000 to 3,000 Japanese troops, advanced south from Pingyao via Wanghe. On the sixth, they engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese defenders at Shangxia Wutou (northwest of Qin County), where the commander of the Japanese Kambegu Detachment was killed, and his entire unit of over a thousand men was annihilated. The sixth prong, consisting of 1,000 men from a unit of the Japanese Division in Anze, attacked Qin Yuan from the northeast on the sixth. The Chinese army has withdrawn from the east of the city and is currently launching flanking attacks. The seventh prong, consisting of another unit of the Japanese Division, numbering 6,000 to 7,000 men, advanced along the Hongdong-Tunliu Road. On the second, they reached Fucheng, with a unit of over a thousand men continuing eastward to Kong Village on the third. Their main force of 8,000 to 9,000 men joined the Japanese troops in Zuoyi County to attack Qinshui. On the sixth, the Chinese army launched a coordinated attack at Nankongtan, Xiwuling, Mabi, Dayoushan, Jiaoruicun, Zhaiyita, and Dongxi Matan (all north of Qinshui), killing over 2,000 Japanese soldiers. Following a flanking attack by a certain division, the Japanese suffered heavy losses. On the eighth, the Japanese troops captured Qinshui and continued their attack on Yangcheng. On the eighth and ninth, the Chinese army launched a counter-attack in the rain and had already pushed close to the outskirts of the city. The eighth prong, based in Yicheng and Jiang County, consisted of approximately 10,000 men who engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army in the areas east and west of Yicheng and west of Zhangmacun on the sixth and seventh. In the battle of Zhishan Xinglongdian on the fifth, over 700 Japanese soldiers were killed in one fell swoop. The Japanese troops retreated after suffering losses and fled east along the Yi-Qin Highway. A large part of 6,000 to 7,000 men is still in the Zhangmacun area. In addition to cutting off the Japanese retreat route, the Chinese troops are also cooperating with other units to harass the Japanese. The ninth prong, consisting of a unit of Japanese troops, captured Huixian from Xinxiang and is currently surrounded by the Chinese forces, making it easy to annihilate them all. The current war situation in southeastern Shanxi is still unfolding. In addition to cooperating in blocking the enemy on the front lines, the Chinese army is also following the original plan to lure the Japanese deep and then cut them off and destroy them. The Japanese army has suffered extremely heavy losses and is currently drawing a large number of reinforcements from the Tongpu area. Taking advantage of the Japanese emptiness, the Chinese army in western Shanxi is mobilizing to attack, and battles have already broken out in the Zhaocheng Hedong area and near Linfen Zhaoqu in recent days. (Fifteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Taking advantage of the Japanese invasion of Zhongshan, Deng Longguang commanded his troops to launch a counter-attack on Jianghui, containing the Japanese rear.

Subsequently, the Japanese army reinforced with over 400 men, and at about ten o'clock, they continued to attack Yinjialiang and Yangjia Hui. While the Chinese army launched a frontal attack, the ambushing troops attacked the flanks and rear of the Japanese army, causing great chaos in the Japanese formation. They retreated back to Dawu. In this battle, over 100 Japanese soldiers were killed, and many military supplies were captured, which are currently being inventoried. (Fourteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) Over 500 Japanese troops from Xia County encountered a guerrilla unit of a certain Chinese army unit south of Nangou Village via Dayang Village on the afternoon of the thirteenth, resulting in a fierce battle. At dusk, the Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attack and collapsed and retreated. A certain Chinese army unit in Dayang Village is currently launching a multi-pronged attack on the Japanese army. (Fourteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Military dispatch: A unit of over 300 Japanese troops from Ershililing south of Jiexian sneaked into Shipo on the morning of the eleventh and were met with an attack by a certain Chinese army unit.

<p>Tongguan: The Japanese troops in northern Henan, Pinghan, Zhengtai, and southern Shanxi, starting from the beginning of this month, used the Fujita, Iseki, Toyoguchi, and Ushijima divisions to launch a large-scale nine-pronged attack on southeastern Shanxi. After being fiercely attacked by the Chinese army in separate ways for days, they were repelled one after another, and many victories were achieved. Currently, the Japanese troops on each route are still fighting against the Chinese army. (Fourteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Changde: The Japanese troops at Chenglingji launched a fierce artillery bombardment towards the opposite bank on the morning of the fourteenth. Subsequently, a Japanese warship and two speedboats carrying over 160 Japanese soldiers landed near Laonizui.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Erroneous View of Depositing Money in Foreign Banks</h3>
<p>A Chongqing telegram yesterday stated that a certain economic expert gave a speech, saying that since the implementation of the restrictions on withdrawals in Shanghai, the financial market has become significantly more stable. However, some depositors still do not fully understand the interests of the nation and themselves, and there are still cases of withdrawing funds and depositing them in foreign banks. Therefore, it is hoped that Shanghai residents will quickly correct this action and not be misled by rumors and make unwise moves. As for the most appropriate method, it is to invest in the mainland, which not only meets the needs of the nation but also allows oneself to obtain substantial profits. These words, even in normal times, would still be sincere words aimed at current ills, but in today's situation, their significance is even more significant. The economic expert's words are like this, and at the same time, the Chongqing newspaper has the same opinion and uses it as a basis for commentary, which shows that the financial situation in Shanghai has a profound and huge impact on the whole country. Then, how can the citizens of Shanghai not pay attention to it?</p>
<p>Since the start of the War of Resistance, the Chinese people have known that the survival of the nation is at stake, and they have automatically contributed what they can without being conscripted. As the saying goes, "Those with strength contribute strength, and those with money contribute money." The ways of contributing strength are varied, and the ways of contributing money are also varied. Donations, contributions, condolences, and disaster relief are all tangible ways of contributing money. However, there is also an intangible way of contributing money, which is extremely common, and the signs are not very obvious, which is the thousands of depositors who have money in state-owned banks and other national banks. From the point of view of economic common sense, depositing money in a bank is entrusting the bank to operate the enterprise. Banks absorb the funds of countless depositors, certainly not to hide them in safes, but to invest the huge collective capital in the undertakings needed by the times. Since the Sino-Japanese War began, the coastal areas of China have fallen one after another, and the base of resistance has moved to the interior. However, the interior is full of treasures and urgently needs to be developed, in other words, it urgently needs development funds. The original funds in the interior are insufficient, and it is necessary to concentrate the funds of the whole country and give full play to their functions. This is also one meaning of "concentrating power." Therefore, the current task of Chinese banks is to use the funds that can be concentrated and invest them in the development of inland enterprises. If this policy can be implemented without hindrance, it will contribute greatly to the War of Resistance and national construction. The funds of the banks are the deposits of thousands of depositors. Then, tracing back to the source, these thousands of depositors are making a great contribution to the nation. Since Shanghai has become an international special zone because of the war, the citizens of Shanghai and the wealthy households of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which are known as the leading economic regions, have gathered in this corner, so the accumulation of funds is directly proportional to the density of the population. The thousands of depositors of Chinese banks in Shanghai are mostly residents of the special zone. Some ridicule Shanghai as a paradise that has lost its soul, but in fact, people have the same heart and the same reason. Which resident of Shanghai does not cherish his country and look forward to it with longing? Which resident does not want to use his ability to contribute his efforts? Why would he be stingy with the funds he holds, entrusting them to banks to make an indirect contribution? However, with the spread of rumors, some people have withdrawn deposits from Chinese banks and deposited them in foreign banks. Is this not a momentary delusion? In terms of politics or morality, moving funds to foreign banks is not only a matter of covering up the truth, but also a crime. Moreover, in terms of economics, it is like a mentally ill person who fears being killed and cuts off his own life. Is it not prudent to commit suicide first?</p>
<p>Inferring their thoughts, how could they truly be ignorant of the overall situation? Misled by rumors, they were temporarily unaware and mistakenly believed that the Chinese monetary system might fluctuate. Therefore, they thought of their own interests and gradually became accustomed to being wrong, which is the most common reason. The Japanese aggressors use military, political, and economic means to achieve their goals. Now that they are exhausted and their soldiers are tired, the strengthening of their conspiracies is timely, and rumors have a place to grow. The interior is not like this. There are many rumors in Shanghai, and the citizens are confused, which is why. However, the one who breaks the rumors is the fact that time has produced. Now that the financial market has become significantly more stable, the facts are already clear to everyone. It is truly the so-called "the damage caused by creating rumors and sabotage may be slightly affected for a time, but it is like clouds covering the sun and the moon, and in a moment, the wind dissipates and the clouds clear, and the sun and the moon are bright." Then, those who had a temporary delusion should correct it in time, and it is not too late!</p>
<h3>Preliminary Talks Between Britain and Japan: Discussing the Tianjin Incident; Craigie Met with Arita Yesterday Morning; The Talks Lasted Five Hours with Strict Security</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The preliminary talks between British Ambassador Craigie and Foreign Minister Arita this morning lasted from 9:05 AM to 12:30 PM. Neither secretaries nor stenographers were present during the talks. The Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a communique in the afternoon, stating that the meeting lasted over three hours. Craigie and Arita discussed the general issues that formed the background of the situation that occurred in Tianjin. The meeting is temporarily adjourned to allow sufficient time for further consideration, and the meeting will be held again on July 17. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador Craigie met with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita at 9:05 this morning, which was the beginning of the upcoming Anglo-Japanese conference. Japanese newspapers stated that if the Japanese Foreign Minister and the British Ambassador cannot resolve the "fundamental issues," the so-called "local incident conference" will not be held. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and British Ambassador to Japan Craigie began negotiations this morning. The Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a statement as follows: Today, the Foreign Minister and the British Ambassador negotiated at the Foreign Ministry on the issue of the Tianjin incident. The meeting lasted three hours and then dispersed. The next round of talks is scheduled for next Monday (seventeenth). The vicinity of the Foreign Ministry and the British Embassy was very quiet today, but the newspapers' comments were very激, demanding that the government take a firm attitude and not compromise. (Fifteenth Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This newspaper reported that when the Foreign Minister and the British Ambassador negotiated this morning, there was no third person present. Usually, there are interpreters, but this time there were no interpreters at all. It is reported that at the beginning of the negotiations, the Japanese Foreign Minister stated the Japanese side's opinions, and the British Ambassador detailed the British side's opinions. (Fifteenth Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondent of The Times stated that the fate of the Tokyo Conference may be revealed tomorrow or Monday. The British government must insist that the talks be limited to local issues related to the blockade of Tianjin. Government officials believe that the Japanese cabinet has not publicly acknowledged the semi-official news published in Japanese newspapers regarding the clauses in the agenda. This may be a good sign, but the British government is now preparing everything to prevent any incident. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the anti-British demonstrations held in Tokyo yesterday, the Foreign Office received a report from Sir Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, this morning and is carefully studying it. According to official statements, the report submitted by Ambassador Craigie has confirmed the news published in the newspapers. (Fifteenth Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>The Significance of Moving the Location to Tokyo</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Anglo-Japanese conference in Tokyo has now opened. The Chinese people in various sectors here are paying close attention to its progress. The biggest question in their minds is how many concessions Britain will make to meet Japan's demands. The fact that Britain did not adopt a strong plan in Tianjin, but agreed to endure humiliation and hold negotiations in Tokyo, is seen by the Chinese as Britain's eagerness to resolve the issue in a compromise manner and prevent it from escalating. All parties believe that the outcome of the conference will have a far-reaching impact on the Far East situation, especially on the Sino-Japanese War. According to Chinese opinion, the negotiation was moved from Tianjin to Tokyo, not because Japan intended to resolve the issue peacefully, but because Japan was confident that it could discuss broader issues with Britain in Tokyo that could not be discussed by local officials in Tianjin. As for the Japanese government's current permission for Tokyo citizens to hold anti-British demonstrations to vent public anger, the Chinese people in various sectors do not believe it, saying that the purpose of the Japanese people's demonstrations is twofold: one is to strengthen Japan's hand in the negotiations, and the other is to offset the widespread belief that the Tianjin blockade was launched entirely by the Japanese military authorities. They also said that the Tokyo negotiations will never resolve the Tianjin incident. If Britain does not yield, Japan will not be willing to give up. If Britain is willing to yield, then why is this meeting necessary? Moreover, the Tianjin blockade is a plan that the Japanese side had already decided on months ago, and it is just using the issue of the extradition of four people as an excuse to launch it. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Talks by the Japanese Military Commander in Tianjin</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to local news today, Lieutenant General Honma, the Japanese military commander in Tianjin, said yesterday when he received Japanese newspaper reporters that, in view of the full support of the Japanese people for the isolation of the British and French concessions in Tianjin in the past month, it can be seen that it is necessary for us to implement our original goals. If the British side insists on limiting the scope of the conference to local incidents, the conference will inevitably break down. We firmly believe that the Japanese government will be able to fully represent the opinions of local officials and the people of the whole country. The British position is now at a crossroads. Only Britain itself can choose whether Britain will stand in an adversarial position with us, and it must make a decisive decision. Honma said that if the conference breaks down, Japan will take measures to prepare for any eventuality. (Fifteenth Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Britain Considers Ways to Aid China</p>
<p>(London) Government officials implied last night that if Japan insists on making excessive demands during the Anglo-Japanese negotiations held in Tokyo today, Britain intends to take retaliatory actions, that is, to provide General Chiang Kai-shek with new military credit loans. China is negotiating with Britain, requesting that Britain lend China a credit loan of 3 million pounds out of Britain's 60 million pound foreign trade credit loan. If Japan raises broad issues as a solution to the Tianjin incident during the Tokyo negotiations, then the Sino-British credit loan negotiations can be concluded after the Tokyo negotiations are completed. Britain is using financial aid to China as another strategy in the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. The planned credit loan of 3 million pounds can help China manufacture aircraft and munitions factories and purchase equipment for manufacturing heavy artillery. At present, China's munitions industry can only manufacture light weapons such as rifles and machine guns. China can also purchase electrical plants and other civil engineering equipment to develop China's inland industries. Britain requires the Bank of China to guarantee the credit loan, but General Chiang Kai-shek proposed that the Bank of Communications guarantee it, because the Bank of China has already guaranteed the US Export-Import Bank's loan of US$25 million to China. China's military needs are endless. After the negotiations on the 3 million pound credit loan are completed, the issue of continued financial aid to China will be considered. Observers here believe that unless the Japanese military authorities release Lieutenant Colonel Spear, the British military attache to China who was detained by the Japanese army in Zhangjiakou on May 26, it is very likely that Britain will continue to provide loans to China. Japan undoubtedly holds a strong card in the Tokyo negotiations, but the fact that Britain intends to take retaliatory actions when Japan makes excessive demands shows that Britain is ready to resist Japan's challenge to dominate China, especially North China. If the United States passes the Pittman Act and imposes broad sanctions on Japan, Britain's ability to resist Japan will be greatly enhanced. British Prime Minister Chamberlain will also follow in the footsteps of the United States and submit the same bill to the House of Commons. Japan deeply feels that Britain is constrained by European problems and understands the inadequacy of Britain's forces stationed in the Far East. Tokyo also feels that Britain is unwilling to impose economic sanctions on Japan alone, unless the United States has initiated it first. Britain will take a comfortable attitude towards the negotiations between Sir Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. If the negotiations break down or the Anglo-Japanese conflict worsens, the negotiations should be postponed indefinitely. If the Japanese side raises demands that are not directly related to the Tianjin case, the British Ambassador will reply that the issues must be discussed with the United States and France before they can be resolved. (Fifteenth Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing's Observation of the Future</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Chinese people are now watching the development of the Anglo-Japanese conference to be held in Tokyo with the utmost concern, because the outcome of the conference will have a far-reaching impact on the Far East situation, and especially the Sino-Japanese War. Chinese newspapers and the public have always doubted the success of the conference. It is said that if the purpose of the parties involved is purely to resolve the Tianjin dispute and both sides have a spirit of mutual concession, then the conference can succeed. However, Japan currently has no intention of resolving the Tianjin case unless Britain succumbs and accepts Tokyo's broader demands. The hope that London has that Japan will not raise broader issues at the Tokyo conference is considered by the Chinese here to be bound to be disappointed, because the blockade of Tianjin was not issued only for local incidents. Japan has already carefully prepared to make a clear expression to Britain in North China in the past few months. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to the observations of the general Chinese people, Anglo-Japanese relations cannot improve in a short time. However, given the seriousness of the European situation, Britain may not allow its relations with Japan to deteriorate. Chinese people believe that British and Japanese interests in the Far East, especially in China, are now in direct conflict, so it is expected that Anglo-Japanese relations cannot improve in a short time. According to Chinese people, Japan is now doing its best to secretly harm foreign interests and forces in China, and Britain has the greatest interests in China. However, Britain, which has already been greatly discriminated against by the Japanese side, will not give up its huge interests that it has obtained through years of hard work. Britain has previously adopted the most moderate policy in the Far East, originally because the British government believed that Japan never had the true intention of discriminating against Britain, and partly because Britain has been preoccupied with matters in Europe and other places in the past ten years and could not pay full attention to the Far East. Since this conflict of interests has existed for a long time, Anglo-Japanese relations cannot improve, it is said. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London Newspapers Express Pessimism</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the negotiations between the British and Japanese authorities in Tokyo, the morning papers have just commented, expressing pessimism. The Daily Mail wrote, "This negotiation is difficult to be optimistic. There is a great divergence of opinion between the two sides on how to define the scope of the negotiation. Although the Tianjin incident only concerns one country, Britain, if Japan wants Britain to change its current Far East policy, then other countries that have interests in the Far East are obviously all involved. However, it can be asserted that Britain will not yield to the Japanese warlords and violate the promises it made to the Nine-Power Treaty." The News Chronicle wrote, "According to the news coming from the Far East, it is better to say that the Japanese are trying to cause trouble rather than that they are happy to negotiate peacefully. For the sake of precaution, we should temporarily withdraw from the concessions that cannot be protected within China, and at the same time inform the Japanese government that, apart from this, Britain must take all measures to safeguard its interests in the Far East." The diplomatic correspondent of The Times declared, "Whether the negotiation can achieve anything depends on whether the Japanese government only limits it to local incidents. If the authorities of that country rashly raise other issues, such as the issue of British cooperation with Japan in North China, as the country's newspapers speculate, then the British government should declare that such issues not only harm British interests, but also endanger the interests of the United States, France, and other signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty under the open-door policy. It is not appropriate to discuss it. Regarding the content of the agenda, what has been published by the Japanese semi-official agencies has not been confirmed by the Japanese cabinet. This may be considered a good omen by the British diplomatic authorities, but the arrival of incidents cannot be prevented. The British government has also prepared coping methods."

<p>(London) Admiral Keyes, commander of the British naval fleet, stated in a speech in London today that if the British government adopts a firm stance, Japan will not dare to clash with the British Empire. He had many close interactions with Japan in the two previous wars. During the siege of Beijing in 1900, when he coordinated operations with the Japanese army, he highly valued the fighting spirit of the Japanese soldiers. However, this spirit no longer exists in the Japanese navy and army. Japan is now faithfully imitating the methods of its ally, Germany. Japan should not be so foolish as to believe that Germany and its allies can escape a disastrous defeat after recklessly launching wars against Britain, France, Poland, and Turkey. Therefore, it would be wise for Japan not to push Britain too far. This is his opinion. The British Empire's financial resources, industry, and manpower are united and determined to resist the enemy. If the enemy knows this, they will not provoke Britain. If they do, the enemy will only face defeat. (Fourteenth Reuters telegram)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Credit Loans to China; Members Advocate Full Assistance to China; Hudson States Negotiations Are in Progress</h3>
<p>(London) Conservative Member of Parliament Morgan said in the House of Commons today, regarding export credit loans to China, that according to general public opinion in the country, the only country Britain should assist is China, which is currently in a difficult situation. This was said during a discussion in the House of Commons after Overseas Trade Minister Hudson moved a government overseas trade guarantee bill. Labor Member of Parliament Bellenger said that the House of Commons has no power to question the financial measures taken by the Overseas Trade Department under this bill. On July 10th, he asked Hudson to announce how much guarantee would be given to British trade in China, which is most closely related to British commerce. However, Hudson replied that the department does not usually disclose the figures guaranteed for any one country. But this morning, he saw that the second clause of this bill clearly stipulates that a list must be submitted to the House of Commons at an appropriate time, indicating the figures guaranteed to various countries under this bill. He felt that this clause was very different from what Hudson had answered previously. Therefore, he now requests Hudson to provide the information he wants on Monday, which is not unreasonable, because he has some criticisms about the Overseas Trade Department's funding of British trade in China. Britain has spent very little on China, which it claims to sympathize with as a civilly governed country. Therefore, he requests Hudson to state how much assistance Britain has already given to China and how much assistance will be given to China under this bill in the future. Morgan continued to speak, saying that China has requested millions of pounds, but he does not know if Britain has only lent China hundreds of thousands of pounds. If so, although the government approves of the principle of assisting the Chinese government, the loan has not been paid out due to the numerous branches of the government's office. He wonders if the Americans have a broader perspective than the British. It seems that the Americans have taken the lead in the Chinese market, such as in the trade of goods needed for construction. He thinks the Americans must have some assurance of return before lending China five million pounds. Labor member Noel Baker said, "I deeply believe that it is in Britain's interest to treat China generously under this bill. He advocated that China should be included in the scope of this bill and given new credit loans in addition to the original loans. The terms of the commercial agreement with China should be lenient. Britain can serve its most important interests in no better way than through this bill. The Japanese militarists have now openly demanded to be allowed to freely establish their so-called new order in China. Britain, France, and other Western countries do not want to comply with Japan's demands. The British government does not want to give up its position, but if the Chinese army's resistance collapses in the end, it would undoubtedly be a huge blow to Britain's Eastern interests, and also a blow to the entire peace front in the world. Therefore, it is in Britain's interest to help China. Now, Britain, its autonomous territories, and its affiliated territories, such as India, absorb more than 40 percent of Japan's exports, which is insane behavior. If Hudson treats China with great generosity, he should help break the new method of financial aggression that the Japanese are currently planning to impose on Chinese legal tender. China is in dire need of funds. Five million pounds in China can produce the same effect as investing fifty million pounds in Europe. We should view China as a part of the peace front's security. What we should be concerned about is not only trade in Tianjin, but also the great principles for which China is fighting, and these principles are the foundation upon which the British government claims its foreign policy is based." Overseas Trade Minister Hudson rose to make closing remarks, saying that a portion of the ten million pounds in the Export Guarantees Act is used for China. This is an open secret. This amount has not yet been exhausted. It is difficult to agree on what China needs most. Negotiations are still in progress. Yesterday, he also met with Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi. As for the question of announcing the figures assumed for China, there is no objection to announcing the details of ordinary commercial transactions. He believes that it is generally recognized that individual transactions should not be investigated. (Fourteenth Reuters telegram)</p>
<h3>Anti-British Movement in Japan Intensifies</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Anti-British demonstrations continued in Japan yesterday, especially in Tokyo and Osaka. Representatives of several groups submitted anti-British resolutions to the government and military, and a delegation presented a memorandum to the British embassy, stating Japan's minimum demands. Speeches delivered at mass rallies denounced Britain as a "disturber of peace in the East" or even as an "enemy of mankind," showing the sharpness of their rhetoric and the use of all possible means. Japanese newspapers today published editorials calling on the government not to compromise. Japanese political figures believe that the Anglo-Japanese negotiations that began this morning will not be concluded in a few days, as the issues under discussion are complex and not easy to resolve at once.

<h3>The Soviet Union Expresses Firm Determination to Defend Outer Mongolia As It Would Defend Its Own Territory</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the conflict on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian border, political figures here recently stated that it is difficult to determine whether this conflict is merely an ordinary border dispute or whether Japan, with the consent of the great powers, is planning to provoke a conflict to divert the Soviet government's attention before the establishment of the Anglo-Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact. However, Outer Mongolia is of strategic importance to the Soviet Union. Therefore, if Japan takes action against Outer Mongolia, the Soviet government will inevitably defend it as it would defend its own territory. (Fourteenth Havas telegram)</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Government Promulgates Compulsory Military Service Law; To Be Implemented After Legislative Council Approval; Related to British Far East Policy</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Due to the increasingly tense international situation and Hong Kong's important position as the first line of defense in the Far East, the Hong Kong government promulgated a compulsory military service law on the 15th, requiring all British men in Hong Kong to enlist. It will be implemented immediately after being passed by the Legislative Council meeting on the 20th. Hong Kong will be the first British territory to implement a military service system. (Fifteenth special telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) It is reported that a bill has been submitted to the Legislative Council to force British people to receive training in local volunteer forces. (Fifteenth Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Next Thursday, the Hong Kong government will submit a government ordinance to the Legislative Council, calling up Chinese and British men aged 15 to 55 to perform compulsory service, with the aim of creating a reserve force. This plan is not the same as the conscription system known in Britain and elsewhere. It will only apply to British people for the time being. The authorities issued an explanatory statement, stating that the purpose of the compulsory service plan is to create a reserve force, and this reserve force will not interfere with the ordinary work of the British. (Fifteenth Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The local government authorities last night ordered all British men to participate in Hong Kong's defense work. Today, all parties believe that this matter is of great significance to Britain's Far East policy. Since the establishment of the National Defense Registration Office this spring, the people here have been speculating about compulsory military service. The implementation of the conscription plan should be attributed to Japan's anti-British movement and the gloomy nature of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo. Also, Hong Kong's Micro-Military Bill will be passed before the end of this month, so some people here firmly believe that the Hong Kong authorities have reversed their two-year wait-and-see attitude and joined the Far Eastern war situation. The name of the bill is the "Compulsory Military Service Ordinance," and its drafting is based on the "Universal Military Service Act" of 1918 (which was repealed in 1919). It is said that the purpose of implementing the compulsory military service ordinance is to form a strong reserve army, which is similar in nature to the volunteer group. In the future, all British men aged 18 to 55 will be required to enlist. The first reading of this case has been set for the 20th of this month, and then a second reading review will be held on the 27th of this month, and a third reading can be passed before the 31st of this month. It is also learned that Hong Kong Governor Luo Fuguo will set up a "Compulsory Military Service Court" to vote for those who evade military service. Therefore, those who fail to pass the physical examination within the specified time limit will be fined 250 Hong Kong dollars and sentenced to six months in prison. In addition, an appeals court will be set up, presided over by the Chief Justice of Hong Kong, to hear cases of dissatisfaction with the original judgment. In the future, the people who should be recruited under this ordinance will be incorporated into the Hong Kong Defense Reserve Team. As for the British people affected by this ordinance, the number is only about 500. According to official statistics, there are 2,500 British men in this city, and only 1,700 of them cannot be exempted from military service for some reason. However, 1,000 of them have joined the volunteer group to serve, and at least 200 of them are not physically fit. Therefore, only 500 people can join the reserve army. The current naval and army stationed in Hong Kong are about 7,500 people, half of whom are regular troops. In the event of an emergency, the regular troops, volunteer groups, and reserve troops that can be dispatched will be about 5,000 people. Also, Chinese who have acquired British nationality will not be bound by the new regulations, but the Sino-British Defense Registration Office authorities have now compiled a list of Chinese born in Hong Kong, and they will also be drafted into the army if necessary, so the number of reserve troops will definitely increase as a result. The news about this Micro-Military Plan has been kept secret for a long time, until it was disclosed to reporters by the authorities last night. According to neutral observers, the Hong Kong government's Micro-Military move is enough to show that the British authorities will not allow any enemy to approach Hong Kong. However, many people here believe that Britain will not defend the Hong Kong colony at a great cost in a large-scale war. (Fifteenth Associated Press telegram)</p>
<h3>Anti-British Sentiment in Qingdao Slightly Eases</h3>
<p>(Qingdao) Since yesterday evening, Japanese Marines have been stationed outside various British commercial firms, and a large number of Chinese employees have received notices instructing them to report to the police station. However, the situation here is still very peaceful. The demonstration originally scheduled for today has been cancelled. The British Consulate has been heavily guarded since two small bombs were thrown into it last night, destroying two cellar windows. The Japanese authorities have begun investigating this matter. Because the Japanese Marines stationed outside the various British commercial firms do not interfere with the operations of the firms, it is believed that the purpose of the garrison is to protect them, fearing that the Chinese employees who report to the police station may be forced to resign. This morning, British Rear Admiral Moray arrived here on the cruiser Cornwall, 89,750 tons. In addition, the only British ship docked in this port is the destroyer Diamond (1,375 tons).

<h3>"Qingdao Conference" Produces No Results</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to foreign sources, the Qingdao conference between the northern and southern puppet governments failed to produce any results in the discussion of organizing a puppet central government. The reason is that the views of the Japanese military authorities differ. Among them, the Doihara faction, including the generals of the Kwantung Army, advocated wooing Wu Peifu, but Wu insisted on territorial integrity and refused to make concessions, so it has not been realized. The Yingzuo faction, which is responsible for wooing Wang Jingwei, does not seem to have reached a harmonious agreement with the Doihara faction. Another faction is led by General Sugiyama, commander of the Japanese army in North China, and is supported by the generals of the Japanese army in North China. It is said that they intend to maintain the "Provisional Government" headed by Wang Kemin. Regarding this, Japanese newspapers reported that the joint committee of the northern and southern puppet governments will still hold its sixth meeting in Qingdao, which shows that the Japanese and the northern and southern puppets attending the fifth Qingdao Conference did not reach a compromise on the issue of merging the puppet governments. In addition, there is a rumor that the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in North China will be replaced recently. If this rumor is confirmed, the emergence of the puppet organization will be further delayed. (Fifteenth telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Claim British Are Spying on Military Intelligence</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese communications received here from Beiping, it is said that some British people in North China, who are close to the Japanese army in North China, are engaged in espionage activities to harm the Japanese army. The authorities of the Japanese army in North China are extremely concerned about this discovery, especially at a time when British military officer Spierke is being detained on charges of espionage. The communication also listed several cases of British people acting as spies, saying that a British missionary in southern Shanxi reported the movements of the Japanese army to the Chinese army in Luan. When the Japanese army was about to fight, he often traveled to and from the railway station in Quwo, southeast Shanxi. Another British missionary, who was allowed by the Japanese army to accommodate Chinese refugees in the church, was also engaged in spying on military intelligence. A British expatriate in Yicheng, southern Shanxi, would have a large number of Chinese troops attack the Japanese defense forces after each trip he took. After investigation, it was found that this British person was supplying intelligence to the Chinese army. British missionaries in Hongdong and Linfen were also found to have reported the movements of the Japanese army to the Chinese army in Luan. An English person in Xia County, southeastern Shanxi, advised the Chinese not to accept the free medical treatment of the Japanese Comfort Corps. Another English person spread rumors that "the Soviet Union and other countries will soon unite to impose economic sanctions on Japan" and "Federal Reserve banknotes will become waste paper, and the Chinese should not accept them."

<h3>China and France Establish New Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to reliable Chinese and French sources speaking to the Associated Press today, China and France plan to organize a Sino-French Chamber of Commerce next month in order to place bilateral commercial relations on a solid foundation and promote close cooperation between the two countries in the Far East. The Chamber of Commerce is semi-official in nature, and the two governments will participate in it based on economic principles. The association will not comment on political events, and its scope will be limited to promoting commercial relations between the two countries. Well-informed sources claim that the new Chamber of Commerce will improve relations between Vietnam and China and will be used to implement what is stipulated in the Nanjing Treaty. That treaty promises China that it may import arms, etc. into China via Vietnam as needed. (Fifteenth Associated Press telegram)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt and Hull Send Messages to Congress; Promote Amendment of the Neutrality Act; In the Interest of National Security; Request That Partisan Strife Be Eliminated and That the Matter Be Reconsidered</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt sent a special message to Congress yesterday, requesting that the amendment to the Neutrality Act be approved before the recess, and that the existing clause of the Neutrality Act prohibiting the embargo of arms be repealed. At the same time, Secretary of State Hull also sent a special message to Congress, stating that he fully agreed with the President's proposal. According to the President's message, "For the sake of American neutrality and security, I deeply feel that this Congress should take some necessary actions to deal with the existing international situation. I have no reason to change this position. If Congress does not do this, then Congress should be responsible for getting into a war crisis." (Fifteenth Associated Press telegram)</p>
<p>Hull's message solemnly stated the necessity of avoiding misunderstandings and misinterpretations of American foreign policy by the general public. He said that the United States' policy is to continue to maintain peace, and that he must clarify the six major guidelines of the Neutrality Act. According to Hull's six major guidelines, they are the basic principles of the Bloom Neutrality Bill, which has been amended by the House of Representatives and whose discussion has been postponed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Hull requested that Congress eliminate all partisan strife over the bill. Hull pointed out that the Neutrality Act is extremely important to the security of the United States in the coming months. Hull solemnly stated that there will be a war crisis abroad soon, and that some people at home and abroad have great misunderstandings about the Neutrality Act. (Fifteenth Associated Press telegram)</p>
<h3>Hull Clarifies Six Major Principles of the Neutrality Act: Repeal of the Arms Embargo Clause Considered an Effective Way to Prevent War</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull's message to Congress, totaling six pages, states the government's reasons for advocating the repeal of the arms embargo clause. It first states that the current goals of U.S. foreign policy are twofold: first, to maintain peace and safeguard the security of the country, and second, to strengthen international law and promote international integrity. Peace is extremely valuable, while war is a great calamity. The duty of the American people and government is to assist in maintaining peace to the best of their ability. "Given the precarious international situation, peace-loving countries like ours cannot ignore such abnormal and urgent situations when proposing peace and neutrality policies. On the contrary, the entire issue of peace and neutrality, and its potential impact on American security and interests in the coming months, should be closely monitored. In my view, the government should take action immediately and not delay without reason, missing opportunities. The arms embargo clause should be repealed. Those who advocate maintaining it believe that this measure can prevent the United States from being drawn into the vortex of war, but in reality, it only deceives American public opinion, leading it to believe in false and unreasonable fantasies." According to this clause, arms, ammunition, and various military supplies are prohibited from being exported, while other goods necessary for warfare can continue to be exported. How can this be considered reasonable?</p>
<p>Previously, I sent a letter to the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses of Congress, requesting the cancellation of the arms embargo clause and proposing a neutrality plan divided into six points, which can guarantee to the greatest extent that the United States will not be drawn into the vortex of war. The so-called six points are: (1) Prohibit American ships from entering war zones; (2) Restrict Americans from entering war zones; (3) For all American goods transported to belligerent countries, ownership should be transferred to foreign buyers before export; (4) The current method of prohibiting cash or credit loans to belligerent countries should be maintained; (5) Establish regulations for fundraising for belligerent countries; (6) The current monitoring system for arms exports and the current method of applying for permits should be maintained. All these six points are the result of careful research. If war breaks out in the future, this will be the best way to prevent the United States from being drawn into the vortex, compared to the current Neutrality Act. "It is broad in scope and more effective, and it does not seem likely to cause any accidents, and it is sufficient to make the outbreak of war more difficult. If our country strictly maintains neutrality, the crisis of being drawn into war will also be reduced accordingly. At a time when international anarchy is so serious and peace is threatened in many places, I believe that the first step to protect our country from being drawn into war is to use our country's power, within the scope of not violating traditional policies, to minimize the possibility of a world war breaking out. The government's responsibility lies in this, and this is something that everyone can see clearly and cannot deny."</p>
<p>The neutrality bill advocated by the government is not only in line with international law, but also does not contradict the policies pursued by the United States for 150 years. "For many years, the government has been working diligently within the scope of traditional policies to avoid the outbreak of a major war. If we harbor prejudices and favor certain foreign countries, providing assistance to some and disfavoring others, then why bother trying to avoid war? Certain aspects should convey the result, giving people the impression that if the arms embargo is repealed, the executive power will become enormous. Conversely, maintaining the embargo can limit executive power. This statement is not accurate. If the American market is opened to the public, allowing all countries to come and purchase goods without distinction, I do not see how the president can gain the power to act expediently. If we maintain the embargo, it will only benefit those countries that have already expanded their military and have an advantage. As for small countries whose arms supplies depend on countries like the United States, if we refuse to allow them to obtain the tools necessary for defense, then countries that uphold international law and love peace will be unable to defend themselves in a serious situation. Is this reasonable?" (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Congressional Figures Hold Different Views: Opposition Parties Have Deep-Rooted Prejudices, Making It Difficult to Expect a Change in Attitude</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's message to Congress and Secretary of State Hull's statement have been commented on by observers, saying that if the arms embargo clause is not repealed, leading to consequences in the international situation, then the responsibility should be borne by Congress. This is the government's intention. A careful reading of Hull's message reveals that the main point is that the neutrality amendment advocates all want the United States to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war, but they differ on how to achieve this goal. Furthermore, repealing the arms embargo clause is not sufficient to increase the risk of the United States participating in the war. If war breaks out in the future, the United States does not want to take sides, and what it seeks is to avoid war. Although all these points are logical, the opposition parties have deep-rooted prejudices, so there is little hope of expecting Congress to change its attitude. Republican Senator Borah stated that Secretary of State Hull's message does not contain any arguments that can make Congress make a decision on the neutrality issue during this session. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that Secretary of State Hull's message is righteous and irrefutable, but it is still difficult to predict whether Congress's attitude will be influenced.

<h3>Chongqing Newspaper Observes U.S. Political Situation: If Isolationists Gain Power, Foreign Policy Will Be Affected</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chongqing United Daily published an article this morning, saying that the difficulties the U.S. authorities are currently encountering regarding the Neutrality Act have no impact on China. The amendment to the Neutrality Act planned by the U.S. authorities is aimed at dealing with the European situation, so it has nothing to do with the Far East incident. The only possible impact on China is that the Senate's opposition to President Roosevelt's policies may strengthen the power of American isolationists. If this is the case, it will be difficult for President Roosevelt to adopt a more active policy in the Far East. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Discusses the Pittman Proposal, Believes It Conflicts with U.S.-Japan Commerce Treaties, Many Express Opposition</h3>
<p>(Washington) Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently submitted a proposal to authorize the President to prohibit the transportation of arms, ammunition, kerosene, and various metals and metal mixtures to countries that destroy the Nine-Power Treaty (referring to Japan). The Foreign Relations Committee submitted it for discussion today. It was immediately pointed out that the current commercial treaties between the United States and Japan (established in 1911) stipulate that neither signatory country can impose discriminatory treatment on the other. The two countries also have treaties stipulating mutual consultation procedures. If the above proposal is passed, it may legally conflict with these treaties. It was decided to first consult Secretary of State Hull for his opinion. Pittman also made a statement to the newspapers, saying that he would wait for Secretary of State Hull to submit a written response before holding another meeting. According to a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, many senators oppose Pittman's proposal based on legal and diplomatic considerations, and they fear that Japan may use this as an excuse to directly harm American interests in the Far East and suspend the purchase of American cotton as retaliation. (Japan is the largest customer of American cotton), so there are also many who believe that this is unacceptable. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>The United States Intensifies the Construction of Naval Ports: Twelve Locations in Two Oceans, Expected to be Completed Within Three Years</h3>
<p>(Washington) The United States has decided to build twelve aviation and submarine bases in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, with a cost of $65 million. Currently, there are as many as 100 companies competing for the construction rights. These twelve bases have been approved by Congress, and $31,621,000 has been allocated from the 1940 naval budget as construction costs. It is reported that the locations of the twelve bases are as follows: Saint John, Bautista (a key point for the defense of the Panama Canal), Kanna Zhi and Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, Sitka and Kodiak in Alaska, Midway Island, Dehan Island, and Palmer Island in the Pacific. The land bases are in Hampshire, Jacksonville, and Wright's Corner. According to naval experts, this project will take three years to complete. (Associated Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Preparations for Pacific Warfare: Japan Actively Builds Ships, a "Mysterious" Battleship is Launched</h3>
<p>(London) London reports that a Japanese "mysterious" battleship, named Shokaku, was recently launched at the Yokosuka Shipyard. Because Japan adheres to a policy of secrecy in building warships, its contents cannot be known. According to a naval dispatch from the "Daily Telegraph," Prince Fushimi, Navy Minister Yonai, and two other members of the imperial family attended the launching ceremony, which shows that the ship must be different from ordinary warships. This ship may be one of the three or four battleships with a displacement of over 40,000 tons that were started in 1936, or it may be an aircraft carrier. The Japanese new fleet has 93 warships, of which some have been completed and some are about to be completed, totaling 221,492 tons, including 5 aircraft carriers totaling 47,000 tons, 6 cruisers totaling 51,000 tons, 26 destroyers, 15 submarines, torpedo boats, minesweepers, submarines, destroyers, and 20 auxiliary ships. There is some evidence that the new battleships will have at least ten 16-inch guns, and it is certain that the new submarines belong to the so-called Pan-Pacific class, which has the ability to travel 8,000 miles without refueling.

<h3>Germany Adopts Gradual Approach in Attempt to Seize Danzig Without Bloodshed: Hitler Gives Instructions to Forster, Military Preparations on Polish Border Remain Unabated</h3>
<p>(London) Several Germans have just arrived here from Berlin. According to them, when Führer Hitler met with Forster, the leader of the Nazi Party in the Free City of Danzig, at his villa in Berchtesgaden yesterday, he had a long conversation about the situation in the city. It is said that he told Forster that the future of the Free City of Danzig could be practically resolved in three stages within a year: (1) When the Nazi Party Congress is held in Nuremberg in September of this year, the Senate of the Free City of Danzig will announce that all citizens of the city have German citizenship, but there will be no change in the city's legal status. (2) Announce that all railways and the Port of Danzig will be managed by Germany. (3) Announce that customs administration will be transferred to Germany. When these two matters are announced and implemented, the governments of Germany and Poland should be notified separately, and the accomplished fact should be placed before all countries.

<h3>Anglo-Polish Agreement: Signing Postponed, Issues Regarding the Use of Loans Arise Temporarily</h3>
<p>(London) The financial agreement between Britain, France, and Poland was originally scheduled to be signed today, but it was not completed due to a temporary issue. According to well-informed sources, the problem lies in how the credit loan granted by Britain to Poland will be used. Poland urgently needs to purchase arms, but at present, British arms manufacturers are extremely busy and it is difficult to deliver goods quickly. The Polish government therefore wants to use part of the loan to purchase American arms, while the British government deeply hopes that the loan will be used entirely in Britain. Moreover, if the Polish government's proposal is followed, difficulties will inevitably arise due to the different exchange rates when converting pounds into dollars. The two sides will continue to discuss in the hope of finding a solution that benefits both sides. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>British Air Minister Speaks: British Air Force is Great, Opens a New Page in History, Air Defense Equipment is Also Improved</h3>
<p>(London) Air Minister Sir Kingsley Wood visited the new Rolls-Royce factory in Creech today, and then gave a speech at a banquet, saying that Britain's efforts in air defense have never been greater in history than they are today, except for the final stages of the European War. The increase in personnel and various plans to increase strength have made it necessary to submit a supplementary air force budget. This budget will allow the air force to continue to increase its staff by 32,000 people and continue to obtain funds of 40 million pounds, so that the cost of air force service this year will reach a new height of 260 million pounds. When the domestic defense exercise is held next month, the public will have another opportunity to see the progress of air defense. Sir Wood also said that the Royal Air Force is now showing its power overseas, which is of great help to the training of the air force. He hoped that the delegation of the air force to France this decision will be followed by an increase in the current aircraft production in other parts of Britain, so that Britain can allocate a large number of military aircraft for use by friendly countries.

<h3>First Batch of 500,000 Soldiers Transferred to Xinjiang Front; Guangxi Province Implements Second Conscription; Expected Total Conscription of 250,000 from the Province; Intensified Training for Special Ethnic Minority Recruits</h3>
<p>Guangxi Correspondence: After the Lugouqiao Incident, the Central Government ordered national mobilization, and various provinces successively held conscriptions. At that time, Guangxi Province conducted its first conscription, recruiting 20 able-bodied men from each village and street, using a lottery system based on the lottery order to draft men into the army. According to surveys, Guangxi has a total population of over 13 million, with over 2.6 million men of conscription age. There are a total of over 24,600 villages and streets throughout the province. Based on the calculation of drafting 20 men from each village and street, approximately 500,000 men were conscripted. During the first phase of the War of Resistance, 380,000 of these 500,000 men were transferred north to participate in the various battlefields in the east, west, and north, while 120,000 remained stationed in the rear for training. After the fall of Hankou and Guangzhou, the Central Supreme Military Headquarters re-adjusted the battlefields on all fronts and launched the second phase of the War of Resistance. Therefore, the military and political authorities of Guangxi Province also held the second major conscription. The Guangxi Pacification Headquarters and the Provincial Government have finalized all conscription procedures and ordered the military districts, civilian regiment command areas, and county magistrates to comply with them, starting implementation on July 1st. It is reported that the conscription methods for the second phase are slightly more lenient than the previous one: (1) The method of hiring substitutes is allowed. If a drafted man has special occupational needs, verified as true by the local township head and reviewed by the county government, the drafted man may be temporarily exempted from service and allowed to hire a substitute from the same township. (2) Civil servants currently in service are still allowed to pay a commutation fee in accordance with the commutation method. It is also reported that Guangxi Province will temporarily set the number of recruits for each village and street in this second phase at ten, totaling 250,000 men for the entire province. Combined with those conscripted in the first phase, approximately 750,000 men will be conscripted. According to a certain military expert, Guangxi has been preparing for rural autonomy for several years, and the organization of villages has a solid foundation, so the conscription work is not only orderly but also exceptionally rapid. Moreover, Guangxi Province is located in the remote western border of China, with its northwest connected to Guizhou Province. The area is characterized by towering mountains, dense forests, and lush mountains, and has traditionally been inhabited by special ethnic groups such as the Miao and Yao. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Guangxi authorities have paid close attention to the training of special ethnic groups. The Department of Civil Affairs has successively dispatched personnel to investigate various border counties, totaling eight special ethnic groups within the province: Yao, Miao, Dong, Liao, Nong, Luo, Ling, and Zhuang. From Liuzhou above Chang'an to the border of Guizhou, the Miao and Zhuang people are the most numerous. The areas around Qingyuan, Huaiyuan, Laibin, Nandan, and Hechi are mainly populated by the Dong, Liao, and Nong ethnic groups. The area upstream from Baise and Sicheng to Xilin and Xilong is mainly populated by the Luo and Ling ethnic groups. The area around Guiping, Wuxuan, Pingnan, Mengshan, and Lipu is purely populated by the Yao ethnic group. The above eight ethnic groups have a total population of over 300,000, distributed in over 60 counties throughout the province, residing in deep mountains and remote valleys. The cultural level of the above ethnic groups is relatively low, but they are known for their strong folk customs, diligence, endurance, and bravery in battle. The authorities, recognizing the usability of the ethnic spirit of these groups, are conducting special education for all ethnic groups while recruiting them for military training, preparing to draft them into the army. Regarding the former, the provincial government has allocated a special fund of 14,000 national currency yuan annually, establishing a total of 36 township central national basic schools and 611 village national basic schools according to the number of households in their villages, sending graduates from special teacher training institutes as teachers. Regarding the latter, each civil regiment command area has established special training centers to select recruits from various ethnic groups for military training. After graduating in three months, they will be organized into reserve teams to be drafted into the army when necessary. It is reported that the training of recruits from special ethnic groups will produce tens of thousands of skilled and brave soldiers in the future, and this group is best at climbing mountains, which is very suitable for mountain warfare in Guangxi.</p>
<h3>Zheng Zhaojing Arrives in Jiangsu Province; Decides to Establish Flood Control and Yellow River Disaster Relief Associations; Requests the Central Government to Allocate 300,000 Yuan for Dredging</h3>
<p>Xinghua Correspondence: The Central Government attaches great importance to the prevention of floods and water conservancy taxes in northern Jiangsu. Previously, it specially dispatched Director Zheng Zhaojing of the Water Conservancy Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to Jiangsu to assist the local authorities in northern Jiangsu in expediting water conservancy projects. Recently, this work is planned to be actively carried out. A few days ago, Director Zheng and Han Zishi, a respected elder of Jiangsu Province, jointly came to northern Jiangsu again to discuss important matters related to water conservancy in northern Jiangsu. It is reported that a concrete solution has been reached. It is understood that the discussions have decided to organize a Flood Control Committee and a Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee, each responsible for promoting the two major tasks of flood prevention and Yellow River disaster relief. Chairman Han will concurrently serve as the Director of the Flood Control Committee, and Han Zishi will serve as the Director of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee. Other staff members will mostly be concurrently appointed by personnel from relevant agencies. The main tasks of the two committees are to expedite the construction of embankments along the canal, intensify flood prevention, and use work-for-relief in the Lixiahe area to start dredging the waterways to the sea. The 300,000 yuan needed for the two committees will be requested from the Central Government, with local contributions. The two committees are about to be established to adjust water conservancy in northern Jiangsu, prevent Yellow River floods, and provide relief to disaster victims, which will greatly benefit the people of northern Jiangsu.</p>
<h3>Repairing Embankments; Completion Required Before Major Floods</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: The Jiangsu Provincial Government has issued a special telegram to the county magistrates of various counties regarding the repair of embankments to prevent floods, strictly ordering compliance. The telegram stated that it has been ordered to repair the embankment projects. Some counties have earnestly implemented it, but there are also many cases where it is treated as a mere formality and the responsibility is shirked. Now that the flood season is approaching, and the Yellow River and Huai River are prone to surges, this important task is even more urgent. In addition to separate telegrams, we are issuing another telegram to urge the county magistrates to comply and transfer the orders to the township heads, strictly limiting the construction date and ordering the construction of earthen embankments around the original village foundations in each village to prevent floods. Those who have difficulty obtaining soil may build embankments separately as a place to avoid floods. All tasks must be completed before the flood season, and this project will be used as an assessment of the county magistrate's performance, which must be complied with and reported.</p>

<h3>Manchuria Is a Heavy Burden for Japan (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Bo Ming</p>
<p>Warlords Seize Railways</p>
<p>But the Japanese warlords, attempting to gain the aid of the Western Conservative Party, were too eager, rashly antagonizing the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union then used the declarations of the Japanese warlords to start anti-Japanese propaganda, as if there was some major significance to it. The Japanese warlords claimed to be the "barrier against the Red menace," and the Soviet Union accepted this pretext, taking advantage of it to say that the Japanese warlords were the "spearhead of anti-Soviet imperialism." In the eyes of those who truly directed and controlled this policy and propaganda on both sides, it was a simulated war. The Japanese warlords tried to gain the sympathy and aid of the Western Conservative Party, while the Soviet Union used the Comintern to try to gain the support of the Western Liberal Party, pacifists, and laborers. But many Japanese and Soviet people, even among officials, earnestly engaged in the propaganda "war," and the attempt of the Japanese warlords to curry favor with the Western Conservative Party in this way naturally aroused animosity in all circles of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Something more important than this was the attempt of the Kwantung Army to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1933, and they made no greater mistake than this. In 1929, the Soviets had expressed that they would not allow the Chinese side to seize their valuable and profitable railway lines, but in 1933, the Japanese warlords in Manchuria began to arrest Soviet railway personnel and obstruct their management of railway money, intending to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway, just like the methods used by the Chinese side five years earlier. As this process progressed smoothly, in October 1933, the Soviet government made a strong and ineffective negotiation with Tokyo, but as the Soviet Union could not obtain satisfaction from the Japanese warlords or Tokyo, it published formal and secret documents between the Japanese army and the civilian officials of "Manchukuo," disclosing the entire plan. These documents were obtained from competent espionage work. The Japanese warlords were not only startled by the sudden display of determination by the Soviet Union, but also shocked that Moscow knew every action of the Japanese side, and immediately stopped their process, finally agreeing to purchase the railway from the Soviet Union. But this foolish conspiracy was one of the most important factors causing friction between the Japanese and Soviet governments, and from that time on, the Soviet government openly used its power to obstruct the Japanese warlords in China, which was Japan's most costly error.</p>
<p>The deterioration of Soviet-Japanese relations resulted in the Soviet Union building large-scale defensive works on the border. The Japanese warlords therefore not only retained some sympathy and support from Western conservatives, but also continued to expand their armaments on the pretext of the "Soviet threat," constantly requesting huge sums of money from their country to fill the funds. However, even before that, the cost of Manchuria had been constantly increasing. The Japanese warlords and their agents, in order to gain public support for their adventurous actions in Manchuria, falsely claimed that this move could alleviate Japan's economic difficulties. Only the ignorant and easily deceived would believe this, because Japan's heaviest economic burden was those warlords themselves, plus the national debt issued for their previous adventures and other constant expenses. But the warlords' promises were soon proven false by their own statements. Less than two years after the occupation of Manchuria, the warlords began to explain that alleviating economic difficulties was not a current matter, but would eventually be realized one day. Unfortunately, the so-called "one day in the future" required Japanese funds to be invested," and the future gains from this "investment" were immeasurable. The promises became more and more distant, while the increase in expenses increased year by year. The amount of government bonds issued by the government increased day by day, and Japan's government banks and other investors were ordered by the government to engage in "investment" in Manchuria together.</p>
<p>Huge Manchurian Expenditures</p>
<p>In 1933, Japan's official military expenditure in Manchuria was 162 million yen, all from the pockets of Japanese taxpayers. In 1936, this expenditure increased to more than 183 million yen and was still increasing. The expenses for laying strategic railways (the warlords told Japanese investors that these railways would "develop the area" and generate interest) and purchasing the Chinese Eastern Railway averaged more than 200 million yen per year until 1936. The South Manchuria Railway issued new bonds every year, including expenses for many businesses other than railways. The direct investment of the South Manchuria Railway amounted to more than 800 million yen by the end of March 1936, of which railways accounted for 305 million yen, coal mines accounted for 120 million yen, and ports accounted for 100 million yen. However, although the South Manchuria Railway seized the Chinese railways in Manchuria and controlled their "management," the profits did not increase as much as the "investment." In fact, the profits of the South Manchuria Railway fell from 61 million yen in 1932-33 to 43 million yen in the final year and had not recovered to 50 million yen in 1935-36 (calculated in devalued yen).</p>
<p>In reality, there were many railway lines that were unprofitable even before the occupation, because some railways, both Chinese and Japanese, were laid for strategic or competitive purposes, not directly for economic purposes. But the Japanese "military economists" expanded the unprofitable development to other aspects of "investment." The low-quality iron in Manchuria could only result in losses if operated, because foreign iron prices were much cheaper than Manchurian iron. However, the warlords built steel plants and spent huge sums of money to engage in steelmaking, and engaged in oil extraction, which cost much more than imported oil. In order to seek economic utilization of this Manchurian oil, the warlords had to establish an oil monopoly and prevent foreign competition. The economic goal of the warlords was to increase the production of military supplies within their own sphere of influence, instead of buying them overseas at lower prices. This was the goal of Manchuria's "economic development." The expenses were all paid by Japanese taxpayers, and part of them would be passed on to their children, making the burden even harder to bear.</p>
<p>In 1930, the pig iron production was 290,000 tons in Anshan and 85,000 tons in Benxihu. By 1935, the former had almost increased to 412,000 tons, and the latter had increased even more. Compared with the price of foreign iron, each ton of pig iron was at least 10 yuan cheaper. In particular, the Showa Steel Works in Anshan, which was established with a capital of 100 million yen, can be said to be consuming Japanese taxpayers' money for military purposes in a more thorough way, with no possible hope of profit. The first factory was opened in May 1935 and has been expanded, and steel production has gradually increased. Because the iron sand is of poor quality, even though the wages of Chinese workers are low, it is still losing money.</p>
<p>Warlord Promises Are False</p>
<p>In the early years of the invasion, the Japanese warlords told Japanese workers that Manchuria would not become a place for capitalists to develop, but would be controlled by the military for the benefit of the entire Japanese people, giving Japanese people great opportunities to get jobs and engage in colonization. Of course, this promise was as false as the promise made to investors. The new railways and new industries established or expanded by the warlords only used a limited number of Japanese people as technicians, managers, or a few special grades of employees, but the vast majority of workers were Chinese, because their wages were less than half of what Japanese workers earned in their own country. In order to save money in these unprofitable businesses, they had to hire Chinese workers with extremely low wages, living almost half human standard lives.</p>
<p>Not only did Japanese workers rarely get employment opportunities in Manchuria, but they also encountered competition from Chinese workers in Manchuria in their own country. In addition to the warlords' large enterprises, there were also textile and other businesses established by Japanese capitalists in Manchuria for profit, because they could only make a profit because Chinese workers' wages were lower than Japanese workers' wages. Therefore, Japanese domestic industries encountered direct competition from industries established in Manchuria, so that workers in Japanese industries had to compete with Chinese workers. Although Japanese exports increased greatly in 1931-32 and subsequent years because the yen was devalued, the overall development in these years has made Japanese workers more difficult.</p>
<p>Reasons for Industrial Losses</p>
<p>One reason why the warlords could not make Manchuria profitable was because the situation was far beyond their control. Soybeans, which were originally the basis for "Manchurian prosperity," the basis for Fengtian personnel becoming rich and greatly increasing the army, its export industry has fallen miserably. If the Japanese warlords had a little knowledge of world economic development, they would have known that this export product was declining and would inevitably continue to decline. In fact, in 1931, careful observers had clearly seen this sign in the world market and in Japan itself. The foreign trade figures of Manchuria can prove that the Japanese warlords have been greatly disappointed in this regard. What they have seized is not an increasingly profitable economy, but an increasingly declining economy. It is true that they have seized Zhang Xueliang's large arsenal, airplanes, railways, banks, etc., as well as his huge private property, but these huge resources have gradually dried up. Manchuria's economy is not only empty, but it is indeed deteriorating.</p>
<p>For many years, both China and Japan had huge trade deficits, with very few years of trade surplus. However, Manchuria was significantly opposite to other parts of China. For many years, the exports of this vast region were more than the imports. Manchuria's exports increased from less than 45 million yuan in 1908 to almost 500 million yuan in 1929, and this did not include the amount transported from Manchuria to other parts of China, which was also very important. Manchuria's most important export was soybeans and soybean products, which were transported to Western countries, Japan, and other parts of China. Manchuria was the only region in East Asia with a large surplus of exports and a trade surplus. Soybeans not only greatly increased the private property and military power of the Fengtian rulers, but also the Chinese who migrated from Shandong Province further south, especially to Fengtian, relied on them for their livelihood.</p>
<p>Decline of Soybean Market</p>
<p>The export of soybeans and soybean products once reached 300 million yuan annually, accounting for 23% of China's total exports, and this special export almost entirely came from Manchuria. It could be used for food and industry, and Japan was its most important market. More importantly, soybean cake was used as fertilizer for Japanese farmland to supplement the lack of human and animal fertilizer. However, since the discovery of chemical fertilizers cheaper than soybean cake ten years ago, Japan has built more and more factories to manufacture them, and its purchase of Manchurian soybean cake has been decreasing. At the same time, Western countries have also been growing more soybeans in their own countries. Since 1927, Japan's purchases of Manchurian soybean cake (Japan was the most important buyer) have been sharply reduced, and its exports have been drastically reduced. Soybean oil exports reached a peak in 1927 and have since declined. In the years when silver prices fell, soybean exports did not improve because Chinese goods were extremely cheap. It was not until 1929 that it reached its peak, and then it began to decline again. Although soybean prices reached an unprecedented low, sales remained sluggish due to the economic recession in the West.</p>
<p>This was the situation when the Japanese warlords invaded Manchuria. They were completely unaware of the commercial trends concerning China, the world, and even Japan itself. The war in Manchuria disrupted transportation and lost general security, making things even worse.</p>
<p>Until 1932, Manchuria had a large trade surplus with foreign countries and other parts of China. Despite the global economic crisis, Manchuria's exports to foreign countries in 1930 still reached more than 430 million Chinese dollars, which was 100 million dollars more than imports. The total amount of Manchuria's exports to foreign countries and China combined was almost 600 million Chinese dollars, while imports were less than 460 million yuan. According to careful economists, the actual trade volume was much larger, because the Chinese customs did not revise the figures according to the annual price changes, so its statistics often underestimated the discounted value of exports. Therefore, the actual value of Manchuria's exports in 1930 was about 880 million yuan.</p>
<p>However, after Manchuria was occupied, there was a big change. The trade figures for 1931 showed that Manchuria's exports were worth a total of 739 million Manchurian dollars (equivalent to Chinese dollars), imports were 344 million yuan, and the trade surplus reached 395 million yuan. The figures for 1932 showed that exports were worth a total of 616 million Manchurian dollars, imports were 310 million yuan, and the trade surplus had decreased to 315 million yuan. In 1933, exports had decreased to 424 million Manchurian dollars, but imports had jumped to 516 million yuan, completely changing from a trade surplus to a trade deficit. The trade deficit in 1933 was 92 million yuan, and it increased to 145 million yuan in 1934. Since then, the trend of trade deficit has continued. Manchuria is no longer a region with a trade surplus, but one with a rapidly increasing trade deficit. Now it does not generate any profit and is no longer enough to cover expenses, so it has to increase taxes on the Japanese people today and issue government bonds tomorrow to make up for the shortfall (to be continued)</p>

<h3>The Concession Authorities Readjust the New Price Limit for Rice, Effective Tomorrow: White Rice at 20 Yuan, Native Rice at 16 Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Bean and Rice Market was subjected to price limits and a crackdown on speculation by the concession authorities, speculators have ceased their manipulations, stockpilers have released their hoards, and the new rice harvest is approaching. As a result, market prices have plummeted. After discussions with rice industry groups, the concession authorities have readjusted the price limits, effective tomorrow. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>New Rice Arrival Imminent</p>
<p>Shanghai's rice supply traditionally comes from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The new rice harvests from these regions are about to begin. New japonica rice from Xiaodong is expected in early August, while "Sheep Point" rice from Jiaxing and native indica rice from Wuhu are expected in mid-August. Simultaneously, due to favorable weather conditions, a bountiful harvest is anticipated. Consequently, stored rice from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui is being shipped to Shanghai for sale. This has resulted in no decrease in the amount of domestic rice shipped to Shanghai, even during the lean season. Rice speculators, wary of the strict crackdown by the concession authorities, have also ceased their market manipulations. Stockpilers are also releasing their hoards due to the hot weather, which can easily spoil stored rice. As a result, the market is experiencing an oversupply, leading to a sharp decline in prices.</p>
<p>New Price Limits Set</p>
<p>Regarding rice prices, the Public Concession and French Concession authorities, along with representatives from various rice industry groups in the city, have decided that, starting from the 17th of this month, the maximum market price for both wholesale and retail white japonica rice shall not exceed 20 yuan per stone (unit of weight), and the maximum price for native indica rice shall not exceed 16 yuan per stone. Price reductions should be implemented uniformly. Transactions exceeding these price limits will not be recognized as valid. Such cases should be reported to the police for investigation and enforcement. The above regulations will be posted at the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association market tomorrow (the 17th) morning, notifying all rice merchants to comply.</p>
<p>Food Supply Secure</p>
<p>According to information obtained by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday from rice industry groups, the rice reserves within the Shanghai concessions, as reported in the fifteenth report on July 10th, amounted to 344,902 bags. Although this is a decrease of 55,000 bags compared to the previous period, it is sufficient to supply Shanghai's citizens for one to two months. Furthermore, stored rice from producing areas is being actively shipped to Shanghai. Therefore, there is no concern about a shortage of food for Shanghai's residents. Yesterday, two to three shipments arrived via the river from Nantong, and 2,400 bags of wheel-transported goods arrived from Changzhou and Tongli. It is rumored that a large quantity of stored rice from producing areas will be shipped to Shanghai for sale within the next week. However, market transactions remain sluggish.</p>
<p>Further Reductions Expected</p>
<p>Chen Ziyi and Zhu Zixiang, members of the Bean and Rice Industry Association Committee, Fu Qiangeng, Market Management Committee member, and Zhang Nianxuan, Chairman of the Rice Merchants Association, met with Mr. Ho Te-kui, Deputy Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, on the 13th of this month to discuss stabilizing rice prices and maintaining the food supply. It was decided to lower the previous price limit by one yuan, effective the 17th of this month. It is rumored that if the supply can be increased further, prices will be gradually reduced again. The market is closed for the weekly holiday today. When it reopens tomorrow, transactions will be conducted in accordance with the new price limits. The Bean and Rice Industry Association has scheduled a joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees for 3:00 PM tomorrow to report on the new price limits.</p>
<h3>List Provided by Japanese Authorities Leads to Consecutive Searches in Concessions; Nothing Found in Public Concession, Firearms Confiscated and Woman Arrested in French Concession</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that detectives from the Criminal Section of the Public Concession Police Department, based on information provided by the Japanese military authorities and in response to their request, conducted a large-scale consecutive search yesterday evening (the 14th) in hopes of capturing guerrilla leaders believed to be hiding in various parts of the Public Concession.</p>
<p>Nothing Found</p>
<p>The search team left headquarters at approximately 5:00 PM and worked for over two hours. Detectives searched all locations listed on the list provided by the Japanese authorities. However, according to information received last night, the search yielded no results. A total of eight locations were searched within the two hours, but no guerrillas or suspected guerrillas were apprehended. It is rumored that detectives will resume searching other locations at dawn today (the 15th), but this information could not be confirmed last night. Police personnel are maintaining silence regarding the search. However, reliable sources indicate that no one listed on the Japanese authorities' list provided to the Public Concession authorities was found in any of the searched locations.</p>
<p>Firearms Confiscated</p>
<p>At 4:00 AM yesterday, the Japanese Special Service Department dispatched more than ten Japanese officials, accompanied by Chinese and Western detectives from the Criminal Section of the Public Concession Police, in automobiles to the French Police Department. They claimed to have discovered dangerous goods and certain suspicious materials at 17, Lane 316, Fuli Road, requesting assistance in investigating and arresting the occupants. The Western Detective Chief dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the address for a search, which resulted in the confiscation of eleven "box cannon" pistols and ten handguns, all of which were new models. A Guangdong woman named Chen Xiuzhen, aged 25, was also apprehended. No men were found on the premises. Chen and the confiscated firearms were taken to the French Police Department for temporary detention pending investigation and handling. Furthermore, The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that the French Concession Police Department, at the request of the Japanese Military Police, conducted consecutive night searches, but the details remain unclear. Reports that 21 handguns (including 11 military "box cannon" pistols) were confiscated could not be confirmed as of this morning (the 15th). The French Concession Police Department stated that no fewer than fifteen separate searches were conducted overnight. No documents were seized, and no arrests were made. The search concluded at dawn today.</p>
<h3>Importers Cancel Indian Cotton Orders; Increased Foreign Exchange Controls and Deposit Restrictions Lead to Sharp Reduction in Foreign Exchange Needs for Importers; Coastal Inter-Provincial Trade Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Shanghai's soaring import surplus has led to a corresponding increase in the demand for black market foreign exchange. In light of this, the government authorities, in addition to having the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund adjust the black market exchange rate and instructing foreign banks to maintain the six-and-a-half-penny exchange rate, have now strengthened foreign exchange controls and restricted deposits. This move has proven effective in balancing trade and stabilizing foreign exchange management. In the future, importers' demand for foreign exchange is expected to decrease. It is rumored that numerous orders for Indian cotton have been canceled, and future transactions will be significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Astounding Quantities of Cotton and Wheat Imports</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs' exports for January of this year amounted to over 30 million yuan. However, there has been no progress in subsequent months, while imports have steadily increased. Imports for January were 39 million yuan, and for May, they reached 72 million yuan, nearly doubling. The main causes of the surge in imports and the trade deficit are the large quantities of cotton, foreign wheat, and other goods being imported. Cotton imports over the past five months have totaled over 59 million yuan, exceeding the same period last year by more than six times. Wheat and tobacco have also been imported in large quantities. Imports for the first five months of the year totaled 17.654 million yuan, while tobacco imports totaled 17.4271 million yuan, exceeding the same period last year by over 7 million yuan.</p>
<p>Strengthening Anti-Smuggling Efforts in the Interior</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of war, the National Government has been preventing smuggled goods from entering the country and harming national tax revenues. In addition to establishing anti-smuggling offices along the coast and conducting strict inspections, the government has also encouraged citizens to report smuggling activities. Through the cooperation of the government and the people, smuggled goods have been virtually eliminated in the interior. Recently, with the coastal ports of Shantou and Dinghai occupied by the Japanese military, the government has issued a general order to all provincial governments to instruct all counties to strengthen anti-smuggling efforts in the interior, establish anti-smuggling offices, strictly prohibit the import of smuggled goods, promote the sale of local goods, and increase tax revenues to benefit the war effort.</p>
<p>Flexible Transfer of Coastal Specialties</p>
<p>Although the situation in the coastal provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong has been tense recently, there is no cause for concern, as the authorities have taken strict precautions. Inter-provincial trade among the provinces remains very active, facilitating the exchange of goods and resources. In terms of transportation, all highways remain open as usual. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway terminates at Xixiang in Jiangxi Province and at Xiaoshan in Zhejiang Province. Passenger and freight transport are also operating as usual. Since the implementation of the six-province joint transportation system involving Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi, the accumulation of special products in various provinces has been alleviated. The Central Trade Commission purchases most of these products and selects them for export. As a result, the rural economy has become more flexible, and the people are reassured.</p>
<h3>Meat Prices Rise Again; Inland Areas Prohibit Transport; Puppet Market Monopolizes</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou, fresh pork has been under control. Now, at various ports of origin, the Japanese military is forcibly registering and controlling the transportation of fresh pork. As a result, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has ordered all guerrilla areas in northern Jiangsu to prohibit local pork vendors from transporting fresh pork to the "Livestock Market" offices at various ports. Violators will have their barges burned and those responsible will be severely punished. This has caused another panic in the local fresh meat market. On the 13th, only 100 head of fresh pork arrived. On the 14th, none arrived at all. As a result, the market was out of stock yesterday, and all meat shops had no meat to sell. A few meat shops went to western Shanghai to buy local pork to meet the market demand, but demand exceeded supply, and prices rose to 1.20 yuan per pound.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Prepares to Pay Maturing Principal and Interest on Consolidated Bonds; Discount Certificates and Installment Payment Schedules Printed; Payment Methods for Reconstructed Gold Loan Principal and Interest Also Determined</h3>
<p>In order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance has requested the Bank of China, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China to discount the seventh principal and interest payment on five types of Consolidated Bonds (Types A, B, C, D, and E). After payments are made by the four banks at the end of July, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank of China about the payment method for the maturing principal and interest on the Consolidated Bonds. Although no official order has been received from the Ministry of Finance, it has been confirmed that discounting payments is a fact. Shanghai will make payments in six installments. Therefore, the bank has begun preparations, and the discount certificates and installment payment schedules have been sent to the printer. Furthermore, it is rumored that the Ministry of Finance has also determined the payment methods for the seventh principal and interest payment on the Reconstructed Public Gold Loan maturing at the end of August, and the twelfth principal and interest payment on the Gold and Long Bonds maturing at the end of September. All three types of bonds are guaranteed by customs revenues. Although customs revenues in the occupied areas of Chongqing have been seized, the government has specifically requested the four banks to discount the payments, demonstrating the government's consistent policy of maintaining creditworthiness. Bondholders generally consider the government's measures appropriate. Yesterday, Consolidated Bonds (Types A, B, C, D, and E) fell in the Shanghai grey market. The reason for this decline was the easing of forward exchange rates. The closing prices for yesterday are recorded as follows: Type A at 58.85 yuan, down 1 yuan; Type B at 49.75 yuan, down 0.60 yuan; Type C at 48.35 yuan, down 0.45 yuan; Type D at 47.55 yuan, down 0.50 yuan; and Type E at 48 yuan, down 0.50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Ambushed in Sanguantang, South of Pudong; Guerrilla Fighters Sacrificed Valiantly; Puppet Troops in Caojing Also Defect</h3>
<p>After over one hundred puppet troops in Pudong defected with their weapons and joined the guerrilla forces, the Japanese military dispatched a large contingent to the Pudong area for so-called "mopping-up" operations in an attempt to retaliate. As a result, Pudong has been engulfed in flames. According to information obtained from merchants coming to Shanghai from Pudong, the battle of Sanguantang was the most intense. Several hundred troops from the Japanese Nanshan Unit passed through Shenhang and "searched" the town of Sanguantang. At that time, the local guerrilla forces had already received intelligence and ambushed the Japanese troops at Xiejiazhai and Zhangjiazhai, key points on their route, while also deploying troops to the east, west, north, and south to lay an ambush. When the Japanese troops passed through the area, the ambushing forces launched a coordinated attack. Caught off guard, the Japanese troops engaged in a hasty battle. After two hours of fierce fighting, the two sides engaged in close-quarters combat due to the close proximity. As a result, the Japanese troops were defeated and retreated, suffering significant casualties and abandoning over twenty rifles and four machine guns. Guerrilla fighters also sacrificed valiantly. It is also rumored that the entire "Self-Defense Corps" of western Shanghai in the No. 2 Prison in Caohejing, western Shanghai, defected the day before yesterday. Fighting is now occurring in various locations along the Shanghai-Minhang Road.</p>
<h3>New Remittance System Convenient and Efficient; Banks and Firms Devise Internal Procedures for Minor Matters</h3>
<p>Since receiving orders from the Ministry to implement centralized clearing of instruments, banks and money firms have held separate meetings to discuss difficulties and exchange opinions. Internal procedures for minor matters are being handled by each bank and firm. The new remittance system has been in operation since the 4th of this month, and the banks and money firms find the centralized method to be convenient and efficient. Previously, banks processed money firm instruments through the Bank of China, the Central Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. Money firms handled bank instruments in the same way. Now that banks and money firms have established separate joint clearinghouses, all instruments held by banks and money firms are authorized to the respective clearinghouses, which are responsible for handling the entire process. Regardless of the number of transactions, accounting methods are used, and balances are cleared the following day, eliminating the previous cumbersome procedures. Rumors that unscrupulous individuals are using "China Prosperity Bank" banknotes to exchange for legal tender, and then using the legal tender to buy Hong Kong dollars for the purpose of buying foreign exchange, are rare in Shanghai and would result in significant losses.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ships Resume Shanghai-Bound Routes; Merchants Unwilling to Board; Baiwumaru and Yangtze River to Sail on the 18th; Moufu Postpones Sailing to Ningbo, Deping Returns to Shanghai Today or Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Since Dinghai fell, the Shanghai-Dinghai route has been suspended. The Japanese side has now dispatched the Baiwumaru and the Sino-Japanese jointly operated Yangtze River to resume service on the 18th. However, people from Dinghai are unwilling to board, and there is no freight traffic. Regarding the Shanghai-Ningbo route, the Moufu arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon. Due to boiler maintenance, it is scheduled to sail to Ningbo on the morning of the 18th, and arrangements have been made for the transfer of passengers and baggage. The Deping is scheduled to return to Shanghai this morning. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Side Dispatches Ships to Resume Service to Dinghai</p>
<p>Since the Japanese military landed in Shenjiamen and Dinghai on the 23rd of last month, transportation between Shanghai and Dinghai and Ningbo and Dinghai has been disrupted for a month. It is now learned that the Japanese side has enlisted several Chinese to form the "Daxing Company" and purchased the Japanese ship Baiwumaru, which is scheduled to resume service to Dinghai, as well as Wanshan and Shenjiamen, on the 18th. In addition, the Chinese Hainan Shipping Company has also cooperated with the Japanese side to purchase the Japanese ship Yangtze River, which is also scheduled to sail on the same day. Both ships fly the Japanese flag, and most of the shipowners and staff are Japanese. However, people from Dinghai, grieving over the occupation and devastation of their hometown, are unwilling to board Japanese ships, and general passengers are also unwilling to load cargo.</p>
<p>Moufu Repairs Postpone Sailing to Ningbo</p>
<p>After the German Lixiang Foreign Firm's Moufu was approved to resume service on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, it returned to Shanghai from Ningbo the day before yesterday (the 14th) afternoon. The ship was originally scheduled to sail to Ningbo again this morning. However, due to boiler maintenance, the departure has been postponed to the morning of the 18th. The Italian ship Deping has completed unloading passengers and cargo outside Zhenhai Harbor and is scheduled to return to Shanghai today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>Arrangements for Transfer of Passengers and Baggage</p>
<p>Because the Lixiang Foreign Firm's Moufu is docked outside Zhenhai Harbor, passengers and cargo must be transferred by small boats. Therefore, specific arrangements for the transfer of passengers and baggage have been made as follows: (1) The valid route for passenger tickets sold by the Moufu is temporarily from the Shanghai wharf to the Zhenhai County wharf. (2) The cost of the barge from the ship to the Zhenhai wharf is included in the passenger ticket. (3) The cost of the boat from the Zhenhai transfer port is the responsibility of the passenger. (4) Passengers' baggage, except for small carry-on items, must first be handed over to the ship's baggage room for transportation to Ningbo or Zhenhai, and a transportation fee of 50 cents in national currency will be charged per item, along with a baggage ticket. Passengers can use the ticket to claim their baggage at Ningbo or Zhenhai. (5) Passengers are not allowed to bring any items on board other than essential travel items such as suitcases, trunks, and baskets. (6) When transferring to the barge outside Zhenhai Harbor, passengers must follow the instructions printed on the back of the barge boarding pass issued by the ship, boarding in order according to the number on the pass and refraining from rushing to avoid danger. (7) The above-mentioned barge boarding pass will be issued when tickets are collected on the ship.</p>
<h3>Reports of Mishap are Misinformation; Pan Gongzhan Safe in Chongqing; Confusion Caused by Inverted Telegram; Actually a Telegram Reporting Safety</h3>
<p>Yesterday, some newspapers in this city reported that Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and his family were killed when Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing on the 10th. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with his fellow townsmen yesterday and confirmed that the above news was false. It was reported that a gentleman in this city received a telegram from Chongqing on the 6th on the 10th. At the time, there was concern because of the inverted meaning of the telegram. After checking with the telegraph office, the original telegram read, "Chongqing bombed again, Brother Zhan's family and brother are safe." It was entirely a telegram reporting safety, and there was no bombing of Chongqing by Japanese aircraft on the 10th of this month, which can also prove the inaccuracy of the above news.</p>
<h3>Subei Chinese Army Counterattacks; Fierce Naval Battle; Chinese Army Counterattacks Starting on the 11th; Naval Forces Sink Japanese Boat</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, the Subei Chinese Army launched a counteroffensive on the 11th. Ships have stopped in various ports. The situations are as follows:</p>
<p>Counterattacks in Various Locations</p>
<p>Starting on the 11th of this month, the Subei Chinese Army Command transferred a select force from a certain location to Jiangyin, Nantong, Haimen, Chongming, and other locations to join the guerrilla forces. They were equipped and began counterattacking the Japanese military. Fierce fighting occurred. The Chinese army was powerful and unpredictable, and the Japanese military suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>Sinking Japanese Boat</p>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, the newly trained naval guerrilla 1st Column of the Chinese army has sufficient strength and numerous armed sailboats. On the morning of the 12th, while patrolling the waters of Xiaoniu Harbor, they encountered a Japanese motorboat and engaged in a naval battle. They exchanged fire with machine guns and small cannons. The Chinese army was accurate and sank two motorboats, drowning more than 20 Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>Ships Stop in Various Bays</p>
<p>The local situation is extremely chaotic, and puppet troops and bandits are taking advantage of the situation to create disturbances, looting along the way, causing merchants to hesitate, and obstructing freight transportation, affecting shipping. Ships traveling to Zhangjiagang, Tianshenggang, Songjigang, Miaotougang, and other ports have temporarily stopped in bays to avoid danger and will resume service after the situation has calmed down.</p>
<h3>Wusong Ferry Service Suspended</h3>
<p>The ferry service from the concession to Wusong, which had recently resumed, was again blocked and suspended starting on the 15th. It is reported that rumors have been rampant in the Wusong area in recent days, and security is tight. Japanese troops have been searching residences daily. To prevent accidents, residents have been staying indoors. The ferry across the river from Gaoqiao to Wusong is still operating as usual. However, security at the ferry is very tight, and all passengers are subject to strict inspection.</p>

<h3>Feng Mingzheng, Manager of the Foci Pharmaceutical Factory, Arrested Yesterday; Arrested Due to Misunderstanding Regarding Worker Incident; Transferred to Japanese Authorities for Interrogation; Will Be Released if No Other Reasons Exist</h3>
<p>At 10:30 AM yesterday, Feng Mingzheng, manager of the local Foci Pharmaceutical Factory, was suddenly requested by Japanese personnel to be detained by the Central Police Department, who dispatched personnel to escort him to the police station. After a brief interrogation, someone requested that he be transferred to the Japanese authorities for interrogation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Injured Worker Suspected of Gunshot Wound</p>
<p>It is reported that a worker named Du, who previously worked at the factory, claimed to have been accidentally injured in the arm by machinery while working at the factory last month. He was sent to Fukumin Hospital in Hongkou for treatment. After staying for three weeks, he recovered fully and was discharged from the hospital. Subsequently, the Japanese side suddenly suspected that the injured worker had suffered a gunshot wound. Japanese military police personnel immediately dispatched personnel to the Central Police Department to request assistance in detaining and interrogating him.</p>
<p>Detention of Du and Others Yields No Results</p>
<p>At approximately 10:00 AM yesterday, in response to a request from Japanese personnel, personnel from both sides met and traveled in three cars to the distribution office of the Foci Pharmaceutical Factory on Yuchaqing Road, intending to inquire about the injured and recovered worker, Du, in order to clarify the situation. The factory informed them that Du was not at the factory. The detectives gathered, with one car parked at the Far Eastern Hotel, one at the Continental Hotel, and one at the factory entrance. Nearby residents were extremely concerned and watched with suspicion.</p>
<p>Manager Arrested and Handed Over to Japanese Side</p>
<p>Subsequently, the factory truthfully stated that Du was not present. Japanese personnel then arrested the factory manager, Feng Mingzheng (from Hangzhou). The three cars immediately returned to the Central Police Department. After interrogation, the Japanese side requested permission to transfer Feng to the Japanese authorities for interrogation. It is understood that Feng's detention was due to a misunderstanding. It is expected that the Japanese side will return Feng to the Central Police Department next Wednesday. If there are no other reasons, he is expected to be released immediately.</p>
<h3>Japan Announces Military Actions in Swatow and Hinghwa; Third-Country Nationals and Ships Ordered to Withdraw; British and Americans Insist on Retaining All Rights</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that the Japanese naval authorities warned third-country governments this morning (the 15th) that military actions would begin against Swatow, located on the northeastern coast of Daya Bay in Guangdong Province, at 8:00 AM on July 18th. The eastern part of the Xinghua Strait, leading to Putian in Fujian Province, would be blockaded the following morning. Third-country nationals and ships, including warships, were ordered to withdraw from the aforementioned coastal ports. The Japanese Navy would not be responsible for any direct or indirect losses suffered by third-country nationals and ships after the deadline. However, third-country governments insisted that the Japanese side should bear the responsibility. It is reported that a few foreign missionaries currently reside in Swatow, but there are no foreigners in Putian. Several months ago, foreign shipping was placed under Japanese control in eight ports, including Swatow. It is reported that the reaction of the British and Americans to the Japanese warning is the same as their reaction to previous Japanese demands for withdrawal, namely, that they will retain their rights in these and other towns. The Japanese side announced new military operations along the coast and claimed that obstructions and hazards would be placed at the entrances and exits of the above-mentioned two ports: (1) Swatow, west of the Shanyiao (transliteration) entrance, and (2) the Xinghua Strait, south of the Antarctic (transliteration) Strait. At the same time, the Japanese military actions against Tongshan and Zhaoan in Quanzhou are scheduled to begin at 7:00 AM this morning. It is generally believed that the Japanese Navy is currently engaged in blockading all exits to the sea in order to complete the blockade of the Chinese coast.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Releases June Industrial Conditions Report; Silk and Cocoon Raw Material Shortage Worrying; Price Index Increases Again</h3>
<p>According to the factory affairs division of the Municipal Council, the following is a summary of the factory situation in the city for June:</p>
<p>Establishment of New Factories</p>
<p>According to the division's report, although the number of requests to establish factories in the Western District in June was not as high as in October, the more notable ones included two factories producing lead oxide and lead acetate, two waste silk spinning mills, one wool and one cotton spinning mill each, one cannery, and two glass factories. Forty-six new factories were inspected after starting operations, with weaving factories being the most numerous. Some manufacturing plants have opened branch factories in the Eastern District because they cannot obtain raw materials elsewhere, including one each of hat factories, oxygen manufacturing plants, motorcycle assembly plants, soap factories, elastic band factories, and disinfectant cotton factories.</p>
<p>Silk Material Shortage</p>
<p>Due to transportation disruptions, few new cocoons have been shipped to Shanghai. The business prospects of the 46 new silk reeling factories that were established in the spring are concerning. In addition, due to the blockade of Zhejiang, all new cocoons from Zhejiang Province are difficult to ship to Shanghai, leaving only Jiangsu Province as a source, which is not enough to meet the demand. Therefore, once the silk factories have reeled all of their stored cocoons, they will be forced to reduce operations. Waste silk factories are also similarly affected. Several factories that use foreign raw materials have already reduced operations. It is claimed that recent financial measures may affect the ability of small factories to maintain their previous production capacity.</p>
<p>Worker Treatment</p>
<p>One weaving factory has implemented a half-hour rest period in the afternoon, during which workers can leave their work and the noise subsides, allowing workers to rest. The factory has installed 30 shower facilities that can be used free of charge at any time. The roof isolates the indoor temperature, reducing it by six degrees. At the same time, the workers' wages have been increased by 8%, retroactive to June 1st, and rice has been purchased and resold to workers at a price 4 yuan lower than the original price. Several other factories have adjusted wages according to the increase in the cost of living. One weaving factory has increased hourly wages by 12.5% and piecework wages by 13.5%, provided that the work is satisfactory. It has been tried to implement an eight-hour workday with the same productivity as a twelve-hour workday. Therefore, piecework wages have been increased to 20%.</p>
<h3>Dutch Envoy and Wife Travel East</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that the Dutch Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Bausenwein, and his wife have recently sailed to Japan for a short stay.</p>
<h3>Dramatic Increase in Chinese Tea Exports, Flourishing Foreign Firms, Strict Control Procedures by the Trade Commission, Tea Firms Earning Millions</h3>
<p>Chinese tea sales abroad are now extremely prosperous. The tea firms of various foreign companies in this port are experiencing a dramatic increase in business. The future is very optimistic. The reporters from Daguang News Agency investigated and reported the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Overseas Sales Flourishing</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government, fearing that the export of domestic specialties would be threatened by some party, formed the National Foreign Trade Commission to prepare for contingencies and maintain the overall export effort. Among China's export specialties, apart from silk, tung oil, and metals, tea is the most important. The responsible authorities, recognizing the importance of tea in foreign trade, immediately implemented strict controls. Production, manufacturing, transportation, sales, and other procedures are now much more carefully managed than before the war. As a result, the international market has a very positive impression of Chinese black and green tea. The quantity ordered by various foreign firms has broken past records. Most of the deliveries are in Hong Kong, with a small number in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Foreign Firms Profiting</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to inquiries made by Daguang News Agency reporters to foreign tea firms, these firms specialize in export trade. In the past, Chinese tea exports were purely ordered directly from tea firms by foreign firms stationed in Shanghai. Since the establishment of the Trade Commission, although the tea firms' business remains the same, exports have become indirect. Order and delivery procedures are now handled by the Trade Commission. The general office of the commission is currently located in Ningbo, with a branch office in Shanghai. As for the operating profits of various tea firms from last year to the present, many have earned several million dollars, with a minimum of several hundred thousand dollars. In Shanghai, the goods currently being sold are mostly from local firms. The amount of new black and green tea transported to Shanghai this year is very small, because Shanghai is an occupied area, and the Trade Commission's control is problematic.</p>

<h3>British Side Unlikely to Investigate Detention of Western Police Superintendent, Considers Incident Closed, No Protest Filed, Police Department Disagrees with Japanese Side</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that yesterday (the 14th) British officials stated that the British Consulate will not protest the detention of Police Superintendent Lees of the Public Concession Police Department by the Japanese on Thursday near noon at the Waterfront Hotel. The Police Department has submitted a report on the matter to the British Consulate General, but compared to other more important issues encountered by British officials in Shanghai and the Far East, its nature is insignificant, so no protest will be filed. It is noted that Lees was threatened by Japanese military police while investigating the Japanese military police injuring a Chinese boatman at Pier 5 on the Bund and was released after being forced to enter the Waterfront Hotel for twenty minutes. It is heard that the British authorities now consider this case closed. A Japanese military spokesman stated at a press conference yesterday the Japanese view on the detention of Lees, saying that according to the Land Regulations, the jurisdiction of the Municipal Council does not extend to the Huangpu River, and the news reported by local newspapers is inaccurate. According to the Japanese investigation, the truth is as follows: Around 11:15 AM on Thursday, the Japanese naval police saw two boats about to moor at the Bund pier and boarded them for inspection. A Chinese boatman jumped onto the pier to escape. The Japanese military police chased him back to the boat. At that time, a Western police superintendent, later identified as Police Superintendent Lees of the Police Department, boarded the boat and spoke. The Japanese military police did not understand him and could not answer, "creating a very strange situation." The Japanese military police gestured to indicate that Lees should go ashore, but Lees remained on the boat. The Japanese military police then invited Lees to go to the naval police headquarters at the Waterfront Hotel. Later, Assistant Superintendent Samson of the Police Department, along with a Chinese constable, also went to the Waterfront Hotel to explain the matter. Afterwards, Samson, Lees, and the Chinese constable left the Waterfront Hotel. According to the Japanese authorities, the Police Department has no jurisdiction over boats moored at the pier. The Police Department disagrees with this point. Assistant Superintendent Samson exchanged views with the Japanese officer in charge of the Waterfront Hotel on the matter. The spokesman also answered questions, saying that the Japanese side still holds its own opinion on this issue. He does not know if the Police Department also insists on its own opinion, but the Public Concession does not extend to the Huangpu River, and "the Land Regulations do not stipulate that the Municipal Council has jurisdiction over the Huangpu River." The Lees case has now been resolved, and there is no problem with his detention at the Waterfront Hotel. The claim that the Chinese boatman was seriously injured is not true. He only suffered minor injuries. When asked if the boatman had been arrested, the spokesman replied that the Chinese "may have been arrested."</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Denies Retirement Rumors, Says Japanese Newspaper's Report is Unreliable, Has Written to Tokyo Requesting Correction</h3>
<p>The report in the Japanese "Daily News" in Tokyo that British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, has expressed his intention to retire to London, England, has been denied by British officials and dismissed as unfounded. The British Embassy in this port has also denied it, saying that this statement is completely baseless. The British Ambassador has now written to Tokyo, asking Ambassador Craigie to request the "Daily News" to make a correction.</p>
<h3>Large Building on Yuyuan Road Undergoing Renovation, New Brick Walls Built Around, Topped with Spiked Iron Fences</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that a large residence near Hollywood Amusement Park in the Japanese-occupied area along Yuyuan Road is currently undergoing renovation, but its activities are kept strictly secret. The residence was once a private house. Now, Chinese workers are turning it into a small fortress, building new brick walls around it and installing spiked iron fences up to three feet high on top of the walls. A small fortress has been built at the entrance. Because there are some gangsters in front of the door, reporters cannot reach the residence and ask the workers. However, according to reliable sources, the place will be used as an office for some party. It is said that the residence used to be the residence of a high-ranking official of the National Government. It is heard that it was recently rented by someone related to a certain party and is being renovated and "fortified."</p>
<h3>New Hurricane Makes Landfall in Southern Fujian, Shanghai May Avoid Impact, Currently Located 120 Nautical Miles West of Wenzhou, Moving North-Northwest Towards Fujian and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>After this port was severely hit by a Pacific hurricane on the 13th, causing great damage, a new hurricane arose near Luzon Island and came towards the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Yesterday morning, it was learned that although the initial progress of the new hurricane was very slow, since the night before last, it suddenly moved rapidly in a west-northwest direction. According to the Xujiahui Observatory's report at 6:00 AM yesterday, the hurricane had reached 26 degrees north latitude and 120 degrees east longitude. The center of the wind force was within a radius of 30 nautical miles (not that the wind force was within an area of 30 nautical miles). The wind force was at level 8. The observatory subsequently reported at 5:00 PM that the new hurricane had made landfall on the southern coast of Fujian Province and was moving in a north-northwest direction. At 2:00 PM, it was at 28 degrees north latitude and 119 degrees east longitude. According to the above report, the position is west of Wenzhou, a distance of 120 nautical miles, which clearly indicates that it will blow towards the Fujian and Jiangxi areas. Shanghai may avoid the impact. Also, yesterday morning, Shanghai's weather changed dramatically due to the wind whiskers being touched. The sky was overcast and cloudy, and the gale was blowing. In the afternoon, because the hurricane had changed direction, the weather returned to normal. Also, the Shanghai Huangpu River floods: during the hurricane that hit Shanghai on the afternoon of the 13th, the water level was only four feet, but the tide was suddenly raised more than ten feet. If a high tide coincides, Shanghai's floods are still a concern.</p>

<h3>After the Import Ban is Issued, Various Industries Request Relief, Should Seek Ways to Handle Goods Stopped En Route, Issue Purchase and Transportation Certificates for Legitimate Purposes</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance announced the measures to ban the import of goods during the extraordinary period, the Inspector General of Customs was ordered to instruct customs offices in various places to comply. Various industries are preparing to request relief measures from the Ministry of Finance so that goods stopped en route can be handled separately. The Inspector General of Customs is to provide an explanation for transit goods. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>How to Remedy Goods Already En Route?</p>
<p>The measures to ban the import of goods stipulate that the goods that should be banned include 18 groups and 234 tariff items. At the same time, after the ban is issued, transit is not allowed. Now, customs offices in various non-occupied areas have been ordered to implement it. Various industries in Shanghai City believe that some transit goods have been stored in coastal defenses for several months or half a year due to transportation reasons and have not been able to reach the transit port. Are there any supplementary measures for the goods whose import is banned this time, such as visa-type procedures, so that the goods stopped en route can be handled separately? They have already requested the Inspector General of Customs to investigate and reply.</p>
<p>Restrictions on Transit Goods</p>
<p>It is heard that the Inspector General of Customs once received an order from the government that for all goods whose import is banned, except for goods declared for transit, if they had already paid taxes at the original port of import before the ban was issued, and at the time of tax payment, the original port of import was still under the administration of the Chinese government, they may be allowed to import after presenting conclusive evidence upon arrival at the destination port. All others will not be allowed to import. The bureau is implementing this ban, and before receiving instructions from the government, for goods that were ordered from abroad or shipped from abroad to China before the ban was issued, and goods shipped from various guerrilla area customs offices to ports outside the war zone, if the above conclusive evidence is not verified, they should all be banned from import in accordance with the order.</p>
<p>Special Goods, Issue Special Permits</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from various related industries yesterday that various industries in Shanghai related to imported goods are currently considering this matter and preparing to directly request relief measures from the Ministry of Finance. It is also heard that for items whose import is banned, if it is for adjusting market prices in the rear, supplying special uses, or for other legitimate reasons, the Ministry of Finance may review the actual needs and issue special purchase and transportation permits. It is heard that the decision to ban the import of a portion of items is actually a necessary measure during wartime, so it has been deeply understood by both Chinese and foreigners. After the implementation of the import ban, based on the import volume in 1938, more than 23 million yuan can be saved annually.</p>
<p>Various Customs Offices Ordered to Implement Immediately</p>
<p>Customs offices outside the war zone have successively been ordered to implement it, including Tengyue, Simao, Mengzi, Longzhou, Beihai, Leizhou, Nanning, Wuzhou, Jiangmen, Gongbei, Fuzhou, Sanduao, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Yichang, Wanxian, and Chongqing. As for the customs offices in the occupied areas, because the localities have already fallen and are beyond the reach of the government's power, there are difficulties in the actual implementation, so the implementation will be temporarily postponed, including Shanghai, Hankou, Xiamen, Qiongzhou, Guangzhou, as well as Tianjin, Jiaozhou, Yantai, Weihaiwei, Qinhuangdao, Longkou, and other customs offices in North China.</p>

<h3>Astrologer Xiao Hutu Jailed for Trafficking Drugs, Sentenced to 12 Years, Drugs Confiscated, Wang Er'er Sentenced to Eight and a Half Years for Drug Trafficking</h3>
<p>Chen Nanting from Hankou City, Hubei Province, worked as an astrologer and hung a sign with the name Xiao Hutu at Room 520 of the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Yuqiaxiang Road. Recently, he moved to Room 413 of the Wu Gong Hotel at 152 Fujian Road. In addition to operating astrology, Chen also engaged in the sale of heroin drugs. The matter was detected by Hua Detectives Ye Yuchuan, Liu Zhaonian, and Li Shugui of the Narcotics Division of the Public Concession Police Force. They then led Hua Detectives Zhao Baosheng and Guo Shouxin to rush to search the place at 2:50 PM the day before yesterday. However, in order to confirm, after arriving at the hotel, they first ordered their companions to purchase a package of heroin from Li with a one-yuan banknote from the Bank of China with the number 977102. Then they rushed in and searched. After arresting Chen, they confiscated 45 small packages of heroin, 17 medium packages, and four yuan and fifty cents in banknotes, and the Bank of China banknote used by the police to purchase heroin was also confiscated. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted him according to Article 4 of the Anti-Drug Regulations. Chen Nanting confessed that he had a concubine named Chen Ying who recently fell in love with someone else and asked him to move to the Wu Gong Hotel. Although she lived with him, she was secretly colluding with her lover. This incident was actually designed by Chen to frame him. However, Chen's confession could not be presented with sufficient evidence. Judge Feng Shide examined the confession and sentenced Chen Nanting to 12 years in prison for drug trafficking, and the confiscated drugs, etc., were all confiscated. Also, the Narcotics Division detectives arrested a drug dealer, Wang Er'er from Yongren, at No. 15, Lane 12, Guangxi Road at 10:30 AM the day before yesterday, confiscating 12 packages of heroin and five packages of essence, and 12 opium pipes.

<h3>Sister-in-Law Accuses Brother-in-Law of Indecent Assault, Case Settled Out of Court, Lawsuit Withdrawn</h3>
<p>Shen Sunshi from Shaoxing, a 25-year-old weaving worker currently living at No. 96, Lianyi Lane, Rue de la Mission, and her husband Shen Boquan, 29 years old this year, previously lived with Mrs. Shao Sunshi, her elder sister, and Shao Anian, her brother-in-law, at No. 52, Wufeng Lane, Rue de la Mission. Because Shao coveted the beauty of his sister-in-law Sunshi, he often teased and seduced her. After Sunshi refused, fearing an accident, she and her husband moved to Lianyi Lane on the 5th of this month. Shao Anian refused to allow his sister-in-law to move out, resulting in a verbal and physical altercation. Sunshi's clothes were torn, and she was beaten in the chest, left shoulder, eyes, and other places, making her unable to work. Therefore, Shen Sunshi hired lawyer Zhang Zhongqi to file a private prosecution against her brother-in-law Shao Anian for assault in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The court accepted the case and summoned the parties for a hearing yesterday by Judge Jiang Fengquan. Both sides arrived in court with their lawyers. First, the plaintiff stated that the defendant Shao Anian's teasing was unbearable, the move was obstructed, and the beating occurred. She also listed her husband Shen Boquan as a witness. The defendant denied the assault and the plaintiff's claims, saying that the plaintiff came to his house at the age of fifteen and he raised her until she married at the age of twenty. He had always treated her very well. On that day, she lay on the ground herself, causing her clothes to be torn. The witness, the plaintiff's husband Shen Boquan, because he usually received financial assistance from his brother-in-law, stated that he did not see the defendant commit the violence. The court examined the confession and advised them to settle out of court, ordering the defendant to compensate the plaintiff for losses of five yuan. With the agreement of both parties, a settlement was reached, and the case was dismissed.</p>
<h3>Drug Offender Arrested in Dingji Lane, Avenue Joffre, Insufficient Evidence for Trafficking, Accomplice Acquitted, Principal Detained</h3>
<p>On the 5th of this month, the French Concession Police received a tip that Yin Sen (37 years old), from Taizhou, residing at No. 6, Dingji Lane, Avenue Joffre, previously opened the Liguangtaichangji Earthworks Company in Jiumudi and set up a drug trafficking operation in his residence. The police, acting on the report, dispatched detectives to the address and arrested the principal offender Yin Sen and his partner Chen Shimei (31 years old, from Taizhou) on the spot, and confiscated evidence such as opium and drug paraphernalia, and brought them all to the police station to be transferred to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for interrogation, which was scheduled for a later date. After the police thoroughly investigated the case, the suspects only admitted to smoking, and the evidence for trafficking was insufficient. Yesterday, the case was changed to be sent to the Eighth Criminal Court. As a result, it was not accepted. The court president Liao then opened a special court for trial. First, the police lawyer stated that in addition to the first defendant Yin Sen, who still needed to be investigated, there was insufficient evidence for the second defendant Chen Shimei, so he would not be prosecuted. The court examined the report and then ordered that Chen Shimei be acquitted. The defendant Yin Sen will be retried on the 18th of this month.</p>
<h3>Sister-in-Law Accuses Aunt of Defamation, Defendant Found Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Huang Zijian from Fujian is currently working in the Chongqing Aviation Office, participating in the war effort. His wife, Huang Lansheng, remains in Shanghai, living at No. 9, Jianye Lane, Fuli Road, French Concession. Living expenses are sent monthly. However, Huang Zijian, because of his wife's misconduct, instructed his cousin Huang Xizhao (36 years old this year, residing at No. 1283, Route Lafayette) to be responsible for monitoring her. Huang Lansheng, because her husband was far away in Chongqing, was addicted to gambling in Shanghai, playing huahui and pai gow. Therefore, Huang Xizhao sent a letter to Huang Zijian in March of this year, reporting Huang Lansheng's immoral private life. Later, Huang Zijian sent another letter to reprimand his wife. Huang Lansheng, because she was scolded by her husband, harbored resentment against her aunt. Recently, she hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Huang Xizhao of defamation. After the court accepted the case, Judge Jiang Liquan investigated and clarified the matter, and yesterday declared Huang Xizhao not guilty.</p>
<h3>Subletter Beats Tenant, Accused of Assault, Defendant Released on Bail Pending Sentence</h3>
<p>Hong Xiaogang, one of the employees of a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner living at No. 40, at the intersection of Kangti Road and Caishi Road, sublet a vacant room to a local blind man, Shao Yizhou, and his wife, Shao Zhangshi, in the winter of the year before last. Recently, due to the issue of rent increase, Shao refused to pay the rent. At 3:00 PM on the 30th of last month, Hong's wife, Li, had a verbal argument with Shao to collect the rent. Hong and his wife, his sister Hong Lipo, the servant Jin Gengtu committed the assault, beating Shao Yizhou. People persuaded them to disperse. At 8:00 PM that night, another conflict and beating occurred. Hong reported to the police, who did not investigate the matter thoroughly. Later, Shao, injured by the beating, requested a medical examination from the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special Court. Later, he commissioned lawyer Lu Zhongqi as his agent and filed a criminal self-accusation against Hong Xiaogang, Hong Caishi, Hong Lipo, and the servant Jin Gengtu for assault at the Second Special Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Haoquan opened a hearing. The defendants arrived in court with their defense lawyer Yu Congdao. The plaintiff, Shao Yizhou, was supported by his wife to the court. After the judge questioned both parties in detail, he ordered the debate, recognizing that the defendant Hong Xiaogang had indeed committed the crime of assaulting someone's body, declared the end of the trial, and scheduled the sentence.

<h3>Charity Bazaar of Women's Professional Club Smashed by Thugs, Two Offenders Sentenced to Seven Months of Penal Servitude</h3>
<p>The charity bazaar organized by the Chinese Women's Professional Club to raise funds for the sanitation of refugees was held yesterday at No. 120 Nanjing Road, 3rd floor. Unexpectedly, around 2 p.m., while the visitors were crowding in, two young men in Western suits suddenly entered the second marketplace and, without asking any questions, pushed over all the temporary counters, causing various toys and glass porcelain to be damaged. Judging from their appearance, it seemed to be an organized act. The case was reported to the local General Inspectorate, which immediately ordered Chinese Detective Yang Peisheng and Detective Feng Qishan to arrest the two young men and take them to the police station. It was found out that one was Jiang Tangqing, residing at No. 76, Avenue Joffre, and the other was Zhu Mujin, both 19 years old and from Shanghai. They were ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, filed a public prosecution according to Article 304 of the Criminal Law on Obstruction of Freedom and Article 357 of the same law on Destruction of Property, and presented the above situation, requesting investigation. When questioned, the defendants confessed that they were instructed by someone to cause trouble, but claimed that they were temporarily deceived. They also hired a lawyer to defend them in court. Judge Zhong believed that this kind of charity bazaar was entirely charitable in nature, and the defendants should not have taken such action. He sentenced Jiang Tangqing and Zhu Mujin in court to seven months of penal servitude each for jointly obstructing the exercise of rights by violence, and acquitted them of the remaining charges. However, both defendants expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict and intended to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court.</p>
<h3>Servant Steals from the Home of Wealthy Merchant Chen Bingqian, Sentenced to Punishment</h3>
<p>Yu A Jin, a 21-year-old from Tongzhou, used to be a servant at the residence of Chen Bingqian, a wealthy Cantonese merchant at No. 80 Seymour Road and Weihaiwei Road. He was dismissed last month for some misdoing. Unexpectedly, Wu sneaked into Chen's residence on the night of the 4th of this month, climbed over the wall, and stole two cameras worth more than 2,000 yuan before fleeing. After the incident, detectives from the Chengdu Road Police Station arrested Wu A Jin along with the original stolen goods and sent him to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Chuan continued the interrogation. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, prosecuted him for nighttime theft under Article 321 of the Criminal Law, and the victim testified to everything.

<h3>Young Musician Madly in Love with a Singer, Divorced from His Wife and Ordered to Pay Over 20,000 Yuan in Alimony</h3>
<p>Wang Zuying, a local woman, 24 years old this year, married Yang Cengshu, a young Cantonese musician, eight years ago. They lived together on North Sichuan Road, in a property they owned themselves. They had two sons, who both died young. After the war two years ago, they moved to No. 288, Rue des Sœurs. Her parents ran the Jinmao Li Ji firewood shop. After Yang's father passed away last year, Yang took a singer, Zhang Ru (19 years old), as a concubine and brought her home to live with them, treating Wang like an old fan in autumn. Wang, unable to bear the abuse, returned to her mother's home at No. 4, Lane 96, Route Doumer. Yang abandoned her and paid her no heed. Yang Wang Zuying hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit for divorce against Yang Cengshu in the Second Special Court, and claimed a total of 25,200 yuan in alimony and damages for the period up to the age of sixty. Judge Chen opened the court several times and summoned both parents and Yang's concubine to the court for investigation. As there was no room for mediation, a debate was held in court a few days ago. The plaintiff's attorney stated that the defendant Yang Cengshu and his lover Zhang Ru and his wife Wang Zuying were all young, and if a divorce was not granted, these three young men and women would inevitably be sent to the fiery pit. This abnormal family is in conflict with the modern system. If they can be divorced, each can take the path of light, which will be beneficial, and so on. Therefore, the court verified the words and announced that the sentencing would be scheduled. Yesterday was the date for the sentencing. Both parties came to the court with their relatives and friends. The presiding judge took the seat and announced the sentence: the plaintiff was granted a divorce from the defendant, and the defendant was ordered to pay the plaintiff 22,200 yuan in alimony and bear the litigation costs. It is said that the defendant was dissatisfied with the verdict and will appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court.</p>

<h3>Minghe Factory Sues Counter-Claim of False Accusation</h3>
<p>Liang Yongao, the owner and manager of Shanghai Minghe Textile Factory and No. 4 Jianghua Yarn and Cloth Store in West Shanghai, hired a lawyer to file a self-accusation in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing him of fraud and embezzlement of 29 bales of stored yarn, requesting investigation and adding a civil lawsuit to recover losses totaling more than 30,000 yuan. Wang hired lawyer Wu Peng to defend him. Judge Miao Qingbang reopened the court for a second hearing and ordered a postponement for investigation and further hearing. These details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the third hearing was held again. The defendant's defense lawyer submitted a counter-claim accusing the plaintiff of false accusation, and stated that an important witness, Xi Shanxian, was present in court waiting to be questioned, and submitted a letter written by the plaintiff Liang Yongao to Xi Shanxian. The disputed stored yarn had been handled by Xue Jin (formerly the chief accountant of the defendant's Minghe Factory). He asked for this ledger to be checked to clarify the matter. Then, the witness Xi Shanxian presented three letters sent by Liu Jingfu. Finally, the lawyer representing the plaintiff expressed his views on the letters presented by Xi and the identities of Xi and Liang. The two sides argued fiercely for two hours.

<h3>Market Price Survey</h3>
<p>Due to the approaching of the sixth month of the lunar calendar, local markets selling fish and meat have seen a surge in purchases of chicken, duck, fish, and meat for "white vegetarian meals" due to the Suzhou custom of eating vegetarian food during the sixth month. As a result, the supply of meat and poultry from vendors cannot meet the demand, and transportation from the interior is difficult, causing prices to rise sharply. The prices of vegetables and meat sold in the British and French Concession markets yesterday morning are as follows: "Meat" Fresh pork is nominally one yuan per catty, but actually only 12 taels of lean meat are provided and weights are based on the city scales. Fresh shrimp is one jiao per two, or 1.6 yuan per catty. Even dead or substandard shrimp must be sold for 6.4 jiao per catty. Fresh chicken is one yuan per catty, and sea shrimp (white rice shrimp) is at least one jiao. Fresh fish is 4.2 jiao per catty, small crabs are 7-8 jiao per catty, mutton is 8 jiao per catty, chicken eggs are 5-6 fen, duck eggs are 5 fen (each), pork kidneys are 3.6 jiao per pair, and pork tripe is 4-5 jiao each. Other fresh meats are scarce and vendors are hoarding them. "Vegetables" Chicken feathers are 8 fen per catty, edamame is 1.2 jiao, long beans are 1.6 jiao, cabbage is 1.4 jiao, yellow bean sprouts are 7 fen, tea bean sprouts are 6 fen, winter melon is 7-8 fen, eggplant is 6-7 fen, bamboo shoots are 1.6 jiao, cucumbers are one jiao, flat bamboo shoots are 4.8 jiao, luffa is 2 jiao, and leeks are 7 fen. Since the shortage of copper coins, although postal notes are used, vegetable prices have been changed to several jiao and several fen per catty. The lives of the common people have become extremely difficult.</p>

<h3>Grass Court Tennis Mixed Doubles: Carson's Team Retains the Championship; Li Guofan's Team Suffers a Crushing 2-0 Defeat Yesterday</h3>
<p>The 1939 mixed doubles final, organized by the Grass Court Tennis Club, between Li Guofan and Mrs. Klinot against Carson and Mrs. Hayles, took place at the French Chamber of Commerce court at 5:00 PM yesterday. There were over 300 spectators. However, the strong wind greatly affected the performance of both sides. Carson's heroic style was still there, and Mrs. Hayles also had many wonderful shots. Li Guofan's performance was abnormal, with many self-inflicted errors. Mrs. Klinot had some good structures when blocking the net, but unfortunately, her weight made it inconvenient to run, so the merits and demerits were offset. After each side had one, Carson and Hayles completed it in one go and won the first set 6-1. In the second set, Li and Ke tried to retaliate, and the battle situation became tense. Each side tied three times at 2-2, 3-3, and 4-4. Mrs. Ke served, and Li repeatedly made mistakes and was broken. Carson and Hayles then took the lead 5-4, then won again 6-4. As a result, Carson and Hayles retained the championship with a straight two sets. The secretary, Spik, presented the awards on the spot and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Youlian Lost to Nanguang by One Point; Ning Shao Crushed Muir; Private Shanghai Basketball Has Eight Games Today</h3>
<p>In the Private Shanghai Cup basketball game, there were five games yesterday. The games between Pyramid and Guoguang C, and Xianyao and the Eagles were all at a decent level. In the women's group, Black Hawk's three wins against China became a one-sided situation. In the Group A game, Youlian was unusual in the first half against Nanguang. Nanguang pressed closer and closer, causing Youlian to lose sight of the other. Although the score rose and fell, Nanguang had more momentum. The first half ended 19-14, with Youlian trailing by five points. In the second battle, Youlian rose up, and Lu Gusui took the lead. The score was very close. Until the last minute, Little Lu got two chances to shoot, but unfortunately, he scored once and missed once, resulting in a narrow 32-31 defeat to Nanguang by one point. When Little Lu's last shot landed, the bell rang. If he had scored, Youlian would have turned the tables. In the final match between Ning Shao and Muir, all three musketeers of Ning Shao attended and played with a formal lineup. Muir was naturally no match, and the result became a one-sided situation.

<h3>Finance: Japanese Merchants Have Ample Legal Tender, Forward Exchange for Imports, Spot for Exports; Foreign Bank Supply Relatively Robust, Market Conditions Ease; Sassoon and Chinese Merchants Still Buying Cheaply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions saw no changes in HSBC's listings. Although settlement demand from oil companies like Texaco, Mobil, and Asia was strong in the British and American exchange markets, HSBC maintained its supply. Moreover, other foreign banks, anticipating a continued rise in the British pound, increased their willingness to sell American dollars, leading to a slightly firmer trend in British currency and a slight softening in American currency. However, there were slight fluctuations in the seven- and eight-month futures, initially softening and then slightly rebounding. Initially, rumors of a domestic public entity restructuring circulated yesterday afternoon, but these were dispelled, calming speculation. Buyers adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and with ample supply from Chinese and foreign banks, market conditions eased. The British pound for this month's gold settlement rose to 6 pence 4375, and the American dollar softened to 12.5 yuan. The British pound for August gold also rose to 6 pence 15625, and the American dollar reached 12 yuan. Subsequently, Western merchants like Sassoon and Chinese speculators bought cheaply, causing market conditions to soften, but the final result was still slightly firmer. It is rumored that Japanese banks absorbed spot currency and settled futures contracts, likely due to recently obtaining legal tender in occupied territories. At noon, foreign banks conducted British-American exchange swaps at a rate of 4 yuan 6 jiao 8 fen 2 li 2, with active trading throughout the morning. The Hong Kong exchange rate slightly strengthened due to increased selling interest from foreign banks.</p>
<p>Early this morning, London telegraph reported long-term trend: near-term up .0625, far-term up .125. New York silver prices remained unchanged. London gold up slightly, half a pence. Exchange rate: British currency up 3 hao against American currency, down .125 against Shanghai currency, up 1 sheng ding against French currency. American currency unchanged against British, Shanghai, and French currencies. Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged (application stopped). Banks opened with spot selling prices: British gold at 6 pence 5625, American dollars at 12.75 yuan, unchanged from the previous close. Foreign banks' selling interest increased, especially for futures. Moreover, those who had bought previously, upon hearing that the rumors circulating yesterday about a certain public entity restructuring had been dispelled, mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Hence, spot market remained flat, while futures immediately strengthened. It is reported that a foreign company absorbed spot American dollars from a certain bank at 12.75 yuan. When HSBC announced its unchanged listing and the silver balancing tax remained exempt, Chinese merchants and banks also increased their selling interest, competing to supply forward British and American gold. Therefore, although Western merchants like Sassoon and Chinese speculators absorbed them, demand could not match supply, causing conditions to become firmer. Foreign and Chinese banks sequentially supplied Sassoon and Chinese merchants this month's British gold at 6 pence 4375 and 40625, and this month's American dollars at 12.5 yuan and 4375. Subsequently, Sassoon purchased August British gold from a Chinese bank at 6 pence 125, while buyers of August American dollars also pushed the price above 12 yuan. Later, a certain party supplied Anda of the same trade this month's American dollars at 12.5 yuan. Near noon, oil companies suddenly started buying, but banks' selling interest remained strong, keeping conditions stable. It is reported that the Asia oil company absorbed spot British gold from HSBC at 6 pence 5625, while Mobil and Texaco successively purchased spot American dollars from American banks at 12.75 yuan and 78125. Later, a profit was sold to the Netherlands for August American dollars at 11.9375. At that time, foreign banks again swapped British and American exchange rates at a price of 4 yuan 6 jiao 8 fen 2 li 2. At that time, the Hong Kong exchange rate strengthened due to increased selling interest from foreign banks. It is rumored that the spot selling price had risen back to 44 yuan, but no transactions were reported. At noon closing, banks' spot selling prices were: British gold at 5 pence 5625, American dollars at 12.78125, this month's British gold at 6 pence 40625, American dollars at 12.4375, August British gold at 6 pence 125, American dollars at 11.9375. Compared to the previous day, spot results showed that British currency remained flat, American currency slightly firmer by .03125, this month's British currency cheaper by .0625, American currency also softened by .0625, August British currency firmer by .0625, American currency softened by .125. The Hong Kong exchange rate also strengthened by .125 according to bank selling prices. There is no market in the afternoon on Saturday. The half-day's trading records are listed below.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Telegraph Refutes Rumors: Spot Cash Opens with a Sharp Drop, Ends with a Softening of Foreign Exchange Futures, Presenting a Trend of Easy Rise and Difficult Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market conditions for immediate cash only had a half-day of trading in the morning. In the afternoon, because there was no foreign exchange market on Saturday, the same industry decided to stop trading for half a day. However, yesterday morning's situation initially showed a trend of exhaustion, with a direct downward slide. Then, it gradually rose slowly. The opening in the morning was due to rumors of changes in a certain domestic public entity, which had already been refuted by the Hong Kong Telegraph. In addition, the foreign exchange futures were strengthened, and the price of discounting cash notes had returned outside of 100 yuan. Therefore, buyers were more cautious and waited and watched. As a result, there was a lack of support for a while, and it suddenly fell sharply to 2,606 yuan at the opening. Later, money exchange businesses purchased on behalf of individual investors at low prices, and a certain bank absorbed on behalf of foreign companies, causing the market conditions to gradually stabilize. At noon, because the foreign exchange futures softened and the Hong Kong gangs searched and purchased, the trend became firmer, and it closed at 2,619 yuan, the high point of the day. However, the result was still a net drop of 11 yuan. Approximately 500 taels were traded in the half day. Gold ornaments in silver shops initially fell and then rose, ultimately listed at a small increase of 1 yuan. Customs gold remained flat. Fine gold and other items slightly decreased.</p>
<p>Immediate Cash Price Drops by a Net Eleven Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened initially without any changes. Then, because the black market was rumored to have changes in a certain domestic entity, as acknowledged by a telegram from Hong Kong, people's hearts were suddenly empty. In addition, it was heard that foreign exchange futures were strengthening, so selling became increasingly strong, and the desire to sell off cash notes became more intense. At that time, most buyers were watching from the sidelines, causing the market conditions to become exhausted. At 9:40, the market opened with a sharp drop of 24 yuan. Silver shops sold 50 taels to money exchange businesses at a price of 2,606 yuan. After the opening, securities firms and money exchange businesses each absorbed 20 taels of cash notes at a price of 07 yuan each. At that time, buyers absorbed quite strongly at low prices, and a certain foreign company also accepted. The market price suddenly rose by 3 yuan in an instant. Silver shops purchased 50 taels from money exchange businesses, and a certain bank (on behalf of foreign companies) purchased 50 taels of cash notes at a price of 10 yuan each. A certain bank again purchased 10 taels from money exchange businesses at a price of 11.5 yuan. Later, money exchange businesses purchased 10 taels of cash notes and traded 20 taels among themselves at a price of 13 yuan each. At that time, money exchange businesses absorbed more strongly, and the price was raised by 2 yuan before long. Money exchange businesses purchased 30 taels from silver shops at a price of 15 yuan. Another money exchange business again purchased 40 taels from a gold shop and 50 taels from the same industry at a price of 16 yuan each. Near noon, it was suddenly heard that the foreign exchange futures had returned to battle. In addition, the Hong Kong gangs' acceptance was particularly good, and the market conditions became stronger. The price was raised by another 3 yuan. A certain silver shop (on behalf of the Hong Kong gangs) purchased 50 taels each from securities firms and money exchange businesses at a price of 19 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the afternoon, because the value of foreign exchange was not available for Saturday trading, the same industry decided to stop trading for half a day. As a result, the noon closing price of 2,619 yuan was a net drop of 11 yuan from the previous day. With a range of 13 yuan, the selling price of the main brand gold of cash notes was 2,625 yuan, and the purchasing price was 2,610 yuan. The current quoted gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. According to inquiries, few transactions were made.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments Also Fell First and Then Recovered</p>
<p>For silver shop gold jewelry, the exchange price for each tael initially remained unchanged. Then, at 10:00, because the black market opened with a sharp drop, the price was listed at a small decrease of 2 yuan. Later, at 12:10, because the black market had risen, the price also rose by 1 yuan. The large counterparts changed the listing to 265 yuan, the new counterparts were 263 yuan, and the purchasing price was 257 yuan.</p>
<p>Fine British Gold Contracts Half a Penny</p>
<p>A telegraph from London on the 14th reported that fine British gold contracted by half a penny per ounce due to the firm rise of the British pound, declining to 7 pounds 8 shillings 5 and a half pence. As a result, the Chinese cash purchase price of the Central Bank was also lowered to 1,211 yuan 9 jiao. The listed customs gold remained flat at 2 yuan 3 jiao 9 fen 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also fell by 4 jiao to 1,207 yuan 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>British and Indian Silver Prices Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>A telegraph from London on the 14th reported that the silver market had a few Indian purchases, and speculators were both buying and selling. The market was flat, and remained flat after the close. India reissued at the listed price, but buyers were watching. The long-term trend of large silver was up .0625 in the near term and up .125 in the far term. New York silver telegraph: American spot prices unchanged. Also, a Bombay silver telegraph: the Indian silver market was calm, the spot price rose by 3 anna, July rose by 2 anna, and August rose by only 1 anna. A total of 100 orders were transacted.</p>
<h3>More and More Arbitrageurs: Discount Rate Reaches Beyond 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts rose sharply, exceeding 100 yuan per thousand yuan. Recently, the gap between near- and far-term foreign exchange rates has become enormous, making arbitrageurs even more enthusiastic. Both cash and foreign currency purchases require cash, leading to a shortage of funds and triggering rising prices. Initially, the rate reached 100 yuan in the morning, then rose to 106 yuan. Near noon, it dropped back to 102 yuan, then rose to 104 yuan in the afternoon before gradually dropping back to 100 yuan, 5 yuan 7 jiao and a half higher than the previous day. The interest rate for the Money Industry Association remained unchanged, 1 jiao and 8 fen for both morning and afternoon sessions.</p>
<h3>British and American Gold Pounds Rise Sharply and Then Retreat Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, fine British gold fell by half a penny. British-American exchange rates remained unchanged. Local foreign exchange firms settled accounts heavily. Western merchants and speculators absorbed actively. Foreign banks provided ample supply. Market conditions were flat for British currency and soft for American currency. The British exchange rate remained at 6 pence 5625, and the American exchange rate was 12 yuan 78125, a retreat of .03125 from the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. Due to many arbitrageurs of drafts, the black market opened with a softening trend in the far term, and customers dumped shares, creating a low opening of 2,606 yuan. Silver shop cash notes absorbed at low prices, and the market conditions were firm, rising to 22 yuan. The noon close was 19 yuan. Trading was not opened in the afternoon. As a result, there was a drop of 11 yuan compared to the previous day. The demand for British and American gold pounds was not strong, and the black market retreated, so the market conditions were weak. There was active trading of British and American gold notes. However, far-term drafts trended softer, and the supply was relatively smooth, so prices all retreated. There was not active trading in Hong Kong notes and French franc notes, and they were both stable. The demand and supply for Japanese gold notes was equal, and the evening price remained at 9 jiao and 9 fen and a half. The demand for Korean notes was stagnant, and the market conditions were weak. The evening price was 8 jiao and 5 fen and a half. There were few transactions at the public association. Rentai issued and Changtai entered American gold notes for 400 yuan. Litong issued and Changtai entered American gold notes for 200 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British and American gold pounds each dropped by 2 jiao, British gold notes dropped by 5 fen, American gold notes dropped by 1 fen and 5 li. Other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Fall Again, Foreign Stocks Await Opportunity</h3>
<p>The securities black market showed a declining trend yesterday, indicating that despite the news being spread, the market had reservations about the reliability of the news before the official documents were issued. There were also rumors of a certain person resigning, leading many parties to be more cautious and slowly sell off their holdings. The market did not have a large range of rises and falls. Since the market opened on July 4th, it had risen for three days, then fallen for three days, then recovered for two days, and now has fallen again. The wavering is unstable, fully demonstrating the anxiety of the people. Those who are skilled and calculated believed that even if the principal and interest were paid according to the rumored exchange draft method, the C bonds would only be worth 45 or 46 yuan. After the opening yesterday, the A bonds fell by several jiao, approaching the 9 yuan mark, and then broke through. The B bonds also retreated into the 50 yuan range. Trading remained sluggish. Buyers such as Shunhongkang and Datong No. 11 were not active in absorbing, and sellers such as Tiansheng Runli Yongfeng Songmao and No. 41 were also not eager to sell. The declining trend did not turn around. As a result, the A bonds dropped sharply by 1 yuan, and the others also dropped by a small 5 or 6 jiao. The total number of transactions was only about 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below. It is possible that today's market will be supported by the British Parliament's strong support for increasing credit loans to China, and the rumors of resignation have not been confirmed.</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 50 shares of the Shanghai Cloth Exchange were traded at a price of 37 yuan.</p>
<p>Stock Market of the Public Industry Association: People are waiting for better news, namely the development of international relations in this area. However, unfortunately, there is nothing new at the moment, and the market continues to decline. Speculators have no direction, and investors are not optimistic. We must wait for the situation to develop. The market sentiment in London and New York has been better recently, especially in New York. However, it is not accurate to say that the new political situation will not cause problems. Therefore, this city is difficult to follow its lead. Rubber unexpectedly showed that American consumption in June was 2,900 tons higher than in May, with a total of 47,300 tons consumed. Inventories are down 11,800 tons, and now there are only 181,800 tons left. This is the lowest inventory since August 1937.</p>
<p>London British Far East Companies' stocks listed prices on the 14th of this month (Friday) fell slightly. HSBC Bank's British registered shares fell by half a pound, with a price of 78 and a half pounds. Kaiping Coal Mine's bearer shares fell by 3 pence, with a price of 17 shillings and 6 pence. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Debt Listed Prices on the 14th of this month (Friday). There were no changes in the upper and lower bonds. British physical sales: 2,000 pounds of Chinese-French American dollars (with imprint) (i.e., 10,000 American dollars) were sold at 37 pounds, a 3-pound discount from the market price. The British-issued good post-loan of 1,000 pounds was sold at 31 pounds, a 1-pound discount from the market price. Also, the German-issued with imprint of 1,000 pounds was sold at 29 pounds, a 3-pound discount from the market price.</p>
<h3>Suspension of Interest Payment on Sino-French American Dollar Bonds</h3>
<p>The Sino-French 5% American Dollar Bonds of 1925 were issued on May 27th of the 14th year of the Republic of China, with a total amount of $43,893,900 American dollars. The original term was 23 years, with one lottery redemption per year, to be fully redeemed by January 15th of the 37th year of the Republic of China. To date, in addition to the 14 issues that have been repaid, there is still a face value of $22,136,650 American dollars outstanding. Yesterday was the payment date for the 29th-term interest coupon, with interest of $553,416.25 American dollars due. Inquiries with the paying agent, the Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank, revealed that the funds had not yet been allocated and that payment would be temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>Four Banks Savings Society Dividends: Semi-Annual Surplus Reaches 400,000, Members' Dividends are 1.2%</h3>
<p>The Four Banks Savings Society, jointly established by the Yanye, Jincheng, Zhongnan, and Dalu Banks, pioneered a deposit dividend system with excellent methods and outstanding credit, making it the only savings institution in China. Since Mr. Qian Xinzhi took office as the manager of the Society in the 15th year of the Republic of China, its business has become even more developed. The total amount of savings reached a maximum of 100 million yuan, with more than 100,000 depositors. It is now reported that the Society's accounts for the first half of this year show a surplus of more than 400,060,000 national currency, with members' dividends still at 1.2%. The two-year fixed savings deposit, with the same interest rate protection of 7%, totals 8.2%, the same as in the 27th year.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth: Guangxi Merchants Have Full Capacity, Yarn Market Declines, Japanese Yarn Alone Rises by 4 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had risen for three consecutive days, entered a stagnant path yesterday. The Guangxi and Yunnan merchants, who had been continuously purchasing, had full purchasing capacity, and the ships had already set sail. Further transactions would have to wait until the goods had arrived at their destinations and been digested. As a result, actual business decreased significantly today. Colleagues' hearts were soft. 20-count Shuangma yarn fell back from 490 yuan to 487 yuan. As for the customer groups, only the Hong Kong merchants purchased 345 bales of coarse and fine yarn. Other groups had very little appetite. The market felt even more mediocre. The banknote discount rate rose again. However, a portion of the psychology was that the far-term foreign exchange rate had shrunk again, and the minds were still bullish. The fundamental problem still lies in the practical sales as the guideline.</p>
<p>The situation of the current yarn market. At the beginning of the morning market, colleagues were all bullish and called up prices uniformly. It was also said that the exchange rate had softened. Because the demand in the south has been good recently, the opening price of 20-count Shuangma yarn was raised by 2-3 yuan to 490 yuan for foreign warehouse goods and 484.5 yuan for warehouse receipts. After this price was opened, it was unexpected that the Guangxi merchants' purchases were not strong and they all called for no transactions. The market price suddenly returned to flat and declined. In the middle, colleagues, in view of the fact that practical sales were not moving, also gave up and watched. Therefore, there were no major changes, and transactions were very scarce. By the close of the market, the price of 20-count Shuangma yarn in foreign warehouses was 488 yuan, and the price of warehouse receipts was 482 yuan. The factories did not take any major actions. According to the half-day transaction statistics, only 787 bales were traded. The market price of 20-count Shuangma and Muyang was not much different from the previous day. However, the price of Te Jincheng fell by 2 yuan, and the price of 10-count coarse yarn fell by 2-3 yuan. Today, there are 120 pieces of cotton yarn being shipped to Hong Kong, 385 pieces being shipped to Haiphong, and tomorrow there are 20 pieces being shipped to Yantai, 50 pieces being shipped to Xiamen, 40 pieces being shipped to Hong Kong, 95 pieces being shipped to Guangzhou Bay, 100 pieces being shipped to Beihai, and 120 pieces being shipped to Tianjin. The amount purchased by each group is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Colleagues 375 Mainland 67 Previous Day's Transaction 180 Hong Kong 345 Statistics 967</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market continues to be good. It is likely that the shrinking of far-term exchange drafts has stimulated the minds of speculators. There are many who are buying far-term. The market price has risen. However, practical demand transactions are not very developed. The current yarn price of 20-count Yueqin yarn is 398 yuan, up about 4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rumor that the US Pledge Release Association Will Receive Cotton Pledge Funds</h3>
<p>The market price of foreign cotton. The New York cotton market remained quiet yesterday. The opening price fell slightly by 2-3 points due to telegrams from Liverpool and Bombay and the settlement of a portion of the bulls. Domestic cotton consumption in June showed slight progress, increasing to 578,448 bales. However, colleagues are all waiting for the official announcement of the US government's export subsidy details and are temporarily adopting a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, the cotton market is even more stagnant. The cotton price has not improved. Yesterday, Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by 2 rupees, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than 10 points.</p>
<p>Regarding the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai, it has been heard that the gold deputy's pledge release committee is hoped to be established in the coming days. However, those who apply for loans on various raw cottons must go through procedures such as sampling, appraisal, and valuation. A certain fee will be charged per 10,000 units. The details will be announced in the coming days.</p>
<p>The local cotton transaction remains quiet. Factories are short of legal tender funds, making it difficult to purchase. A portion of the yarn factories have absorbed enough raw materials, and there are currently no urgent purchases being made. The number of transactions is generally becoming more and more cold. However, although colleagues are doing mutual buying and selling business, the amount of achievement is also very small. However, colleagues took in 200 pieces of Bairo at a price of 102 yuan. The hurricane that delivered the exchange to the factory has dissipated. The shipping industry in northern Jiangsu has resumed. 430 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived today.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Difficult Situation for Chinese Textile Factories; Guerrilla Areas Have Become a "Dong Pi" World; Rebranded and Disguised Goods are Also Rampant</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Long-term foreign exchange has shrunk drastically, "Dong Pi" (Japanese Cloth) has rebounded sharply, and domestically produced dyed cloth is selling briskly, with asking prices rising by one or two "jiao". Native cotton cloth still lacks improvement, with flat opening prices. Yesterday, large buyers from Sichuan and Yunnan in the Southwest continued to purchase four or five thousand pieces of dyed cloth and dyed twill, and over a thousand pieces of broadcloth and woolen cloth. Shipping has also been robust in recent days. White cloth sales are sluggish, accounting for only one-tenth of the market, because the fine cloth and fine twill purchased from Yong'an, Shenxin, Yu and other factories in the Southwest are priced at fifteen or sixteen yuan per piece. However, dyeing factories in Shanghai are using certain imported grey fabrics, and after processing, they are even cheaper than domestically produced native cloth. Recently, there has been overproduction of certain foreign goods, leading to low prices for grey fabrics, creating an even greater price disparity. As a result, the sales performance is drastically different. This district and the guerrilla areas are already a "Dong Pi" world, and goods with altered brands and disguised origins from occupied areas are also extremely rampant. Therefore, Chinese textile factories are in a precarious situation, facing uncertainty from morning to night.</p>
<p>"Dong Pi" (Japanese Cloth)</p>
<p>White fine cloth and fine twill experienced active sales yesterday, and market sentiment strengthened. Asking prices rose across the board. "Long Tou" (Dragon Head) fine cloth rose sharply by two and a half "jiao" per piece, reaching thirteen yuan and one and a half "jiao". Merchants from Qinhuangdao in the north purchased three hundred packages of "Long Tou," "Cai Qiu" (Colored Ball), and "Fei Yu" (Flying Fish) brand fine cloth. Merchants from Tianjin purchased over three hundred pieces of fine cloth for forward delivery. Sentiment in this district has also changed. Merchants are now purchasing five hundred packages of fine cloth and fine twill for forward delivery. At the same time, the "Dong Mian Hang" (Eastern Cotton Exchange) offered four hundred packages of "Hua Wu Long Men" (Flowered Dragon Gate) brand fine cloth at twelve pounds, priced at thirteen yuan and nine and a half "jiao" per piece. Dyed broadcloth and "Zhi Gong" (Tribute) cloth also rose in price. Lower-priced "Si Jun Zi" (Four Gentlemen) broadcloth, which had reached a low of four "jiao," one "fen," and seventy-five "li" per yard, has now risen to four "jiao" and two and a half "fen". "Zhi Gong" cloth is priced at four "jiao" and one and a half "fen" (all cash). The asking price for new "Yi Sheng Da Tian" (One Sound Reaching Heaven) broadcloth from a major factory was four "jiao" and one "fen" in the previous market (half cash, half remittance). Yesterday, it also sold for four "jiao" and two "fen," and the asking price increased to four "jiao" and three "fen." Merchants in this district purchased over one hundred boxes.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>Seventeen pieces of textiles were exported on the 17th, sixteen pieces to Tianjin, one hundred pieces to Yantai, five pieces to Xiamen, twenty-five pieces to Hong Kong, and three pieces to Guangzhou Bay. Another fifty pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>Small Textile Factories: An Investigation into Closures</h3>
<p>Small textile factories, whether relocated from occupied areas or newly established on the island, have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. However, in a short period, the transportation routes for cotton cloth entering the mainland have been gradually severed, and various obstacles have hindered business for merchants, leading to closures. The capital of small textile factories is inherently weak, and most are speculative. They cannot withstand such blows. Generally, each textile factory has between two or three hundred looms at most, and only a hundred or so at the least. The woven cloth primarily consists of grey plain cloth, fine plain cloth, and twill. Each loom can produce a maximum of three pieces of coarse plain cloth, each forty yards long, per day and night (fine plain cloth and twill production is less, around two pieces). Accordingly, each loom needs to prepare fifty pounds of warp, weft, and yarn per day and night. For a hundred looms, the total daily and nightly raw material requirement is five thousand pounds, which translates to approximately twelve bales of yarn, calculated at four hundred and twenty pounds per bale (two to three hundred looms would require thirty to forty bales of yarn). The total value is five to six thousand yuan. Therefore, the working capital for one month's raw material turnover is fifteen to sixteen thousand yuan. If the cotton cloth business is good, this is not a problem. With twenty to thirty thousand yuan of working capital for raw materials, the machines can operate continuously by selling finished products and purchasing cotton yarn. However, if finished products accumulate due to market sluggishness and various obstacles, the factory has no choice but to shut down and cease operations after five or six days of work. Continued shutdowns lead to financial difficulties, forcing closures. Therefore, it is increasingly common to hear of small textile factories without strong capital backing suspending or reducing operations. Even well-capitalized factories (with three hundred and sixty looms) are struggling and on the verge of closure. (Long Ju Sheng)</p>
<h3>Grain: Lack of Cash Hinders Flour Sales; Wheat Market Also Lacks Sparkle</h3>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The spot flour market was as uneventful as ever yesterday. Sales to merchants continue to be constrained by a lack of cash, and there has been no significant off-take. Apart from some re-circulated goods being offered in the market, very few are purchasing directly from factories with cash. Even retail transactions in this district favor purchasing re-circulated goods, as they are cheaper than factory prices due to remittances. Total market transactions, including those with merchants, amounted to only thirteen to fifteen thousand bags. Factory prices for number two flour still require four yuan and six and a half "jiao" in cash, while re-circulated goods are offered at only four yuan and nine and a half "jiao" for remittance.</p>
<p>Wheat</p>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of wheat continued to arrive uninterrupted. The amount of goods held by merchants on the docks and offered for sale gradually increased. The only outlet is the Japanese factory. However, the Japanese factory's intake has been limited recently, often suppressing prices. The entire factory has also recently set prices for foreign wheat, further dampening the demand for local wheat. As a result, the market lacks sparkle. Yesterday, the market was quiet with few transactions as supply and demand prices were difficult to reconcile.</p>
<h3>Hot and Humid Weather; Rice Market Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>Du Geng (Rice Variety): Yesterday, the domestic rice market continued its downward trend. With weak sentiment, merchants and traders continued to sell off their holdings. The only sales channel in this district remains sluggish. Cheap goods from inland merchants have some outlet, but the declining market conditions are difficult to support. As a result, prices for thick and thin "Geng" (Japonica) rice and "Du Yang Jian" (Du Yang Pointed) and "Bu Jian" (Port Pointed) rice fell by two to three "jiao". Arrivals from the river are still limited to number two rice from the Songjiang merchant, with 1,400 to 1,500 bags of "Che Shu Baozi" (Cart-Transported Steamed Bun) and "Nan Gang" (South Port) rice. Total market transactions amounted to over seven thousand "shi".</p>
<p>Ke Xian (Rice Variety): Sales to inland areas are unlikely to improve, and arrivals are continuous. Dockside storage is full, and merchants are willing to reduce prices due to the hot weather causing rice to steam. Amid widespread price declines in the rice market, another severe drop was seen. High-quality "Xian" (Indica) rice fell by two to three "jiao," while overnight settlements dropped by as much as four, five, or six "jiao". High-quality "Jing Xian" (Capital Indica) rice is priced at fifteen yuan and six or seven "jiao," and high-quality "Wu Xian" (Wuhu Indica) rice is priced at fifteen yuan and five "jiao," with separate settlements. "Zhong Guan" (Central Gate) rice is even weaker due to sluggish inland sales, priced at slightly over thirteen yuan. However, transaction volume was limited to three thousand five or six hundred bags due to the market being closed for Sunday, mostly from this district.</p>
<p>Bian Yuan (Rice Variety): Transactions remain scarce. Given the current rice market situation, with ample dockside storage and Wuhu prices also reportedly declining, sentiment is unlikely to rebound in the short term.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Declines Again</h3>
<p>According to Reuters news from London yesterday, near-term August sugar prices fell sharply by four and a quarter "bian shi" to seven shillings and one and a half "bian shi," while longer-term prices rose slightly by a quarter. December is at six shillings and two and a half "bian shi," and March of next year is at six shillings and three "bian shi". The local association's listed price for spot number 24 coarse white sugar fell by two "jiao". The price at this warehouse is twenty-nine yuan and three "jiao," and the price at other warehouses fell by one "jiao." Re-export goods fell by three "jiao," with two hundred bags transacted at twenty-one yuan. "Tai Gu" (Taikoo) white sugar saw a larger price reduction, with top-grade sugar falling by four to five "jiao." Western warehouse B mark is thirty yuan and six "jiao," Eastern warehouse is four "jiao" for one hundred bags. CW mark is thirty yuan and three "jiao" at the western warehouse, CX is thirty yuan, DY mark is twenty-nine yuan and seven "jiao," and HX mark is twenty-nine yuan and a half. Locally produced cotton white sugar fell by five "jiao." Zhen Ji number one is twenty-nine yuan, and numbers two, three, and four are discounted accordingly. There were no other significant price changes. Only the Chaozhou merchants offered forty bags of ice flower white sugar for domestic sugar. The quality is ordinary, and the price is twenty-seven yuan and seven "jiao".</p>
<h3>Oilseed Cakes: Soybean Cake Transactions Become Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the oil market was in a state of disarray, with various merchants reluctant to make progress and unwilling to sell cheaply, resulting in a stalemate. The market did not open, but the soybean cake market became active, and transactions commenced. Owners seized the opportunity to raise prices, allowing market prices to rise frequently. As a result, prices rose by four to five "fen" compared to the previous market. Five thousand pieces of "Da Yun Yuan Ji" (Great Fortune Source Mark) cake were offered, and the price increased from three yuan and nine "fen" to three yuan and one "jiao" and three "fen". Seven thousand pieces of miscellaneous brand cake were priced at three yuan and seven "fen," eventually reaching three yuan and one "jiao".</p>
<h3>Dried Seafood: Arrowroot Flour and Sago Remain Firm</h3>
<p>Sales of arrowroot flour are strongest in this district, as transportation to other ports is largely obstructed. The current market price is twenty-one yuan for "Ren Qiang" (Human Gun), twenty yuan for "Fei Qi Lin" (Flying Unicorn), nineteen yuan and five "jiao" for "San X" (Triple X), nineteen yuan and five "jiao" for "KG", and seventeen yuan for "Shuang T" (Double T), all for cash. Sales of sago are also good, with large granules at twenty-three yuan and small granules at twenty-one yuan, also for cash transactions, demonstrating strong performance.</p>
<h3>Domestically Produced Fragrant Mushrooms: Shanghai Inventory Nearing Depletion</h3>
<p>The supply of domestically produced fragrant mushrooms from various ports has been disrupted. Local inventory is nearing depletion, leading to rising market prices. For example, "Jian Gu" (Jianning Mushrooms) opened at three hundred and thirty yuan in the previous market and subsequently rose to three hundred and fifty yuan. The current market price is three hundred and eighty yuan, representing a significant increase of twenty to thirty yuan.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Goods: Preserved Peaches Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Preserved peaches have seen limited arrivals and active sales, leading to another price increase. Cold storage Tianjin peaches have risen to ninety yuan. Tiger skin peaches are selling for sixty-five to sixty-six yuan, with some asking for seventy yuan. Walnut kernels are also becoming tight, with hand-picked peaches at forty-eight yuan, settlements at forty-two to forty-three yuan, and southern peaches at thirty yuan.</p>
<h3>Wood Ear Sales are Active</h3>
<p>Wood ear has been selling actively recently. Sichuan wood ear is currently selling for one hundred and eighty-five yuan, Han wood ear for one hundred and ninety yuan, mail-package wood ear for one hundred and eighty-five to ninety yuan, and deputy wood ear for two hundred and forty yuan, demonstrating strong performance.</p>
<h3>Metals: American Iron is Selling Well Only in Tianjin</h3>
<p>American narrow strip tinplate has been quite active recently. The reason is that merchants from Tianjin are buying up large quantities. In addition, buyers from Yantai and Qingdao are also actively purchasing. Other sectors in this district (such as cigarette factories and can manufacturers) also have strong demand. Moreover, there is not much spot inventory in this port, so sentiment is very good. The standard asking price is unlikely to loosen for the time being. The current market price for assorted colors is forty-six yuan per box (calculated at two hundred pounds), the price for single-pick large colors is fifty-two yuan per box, and the price for single-pick small colors is only forty yuan per box, all higher than the previous market by one to two yuan. Overseas orders are also not very large, so quoted prices have also risen slightly by a few "jin jiao" compared to before. The current overseas price is reportedly sixty-two US dollars per ton.</p>
<h3>Coal: Pacific Coal Arrives, Approximately Two Hundred Tons</h3>
<p>The bituminous coal business experienced a period of strong sales last month, but it has been rather quiet recently. This is because demanders have gradually satisfied their needs, and the supply from various sources is continuous, resulting in sluggish transactions and stable market prices. Yesterday, a foreign firm had over two hundred tons of Pacific coal arrive in port. The listed price is thirty-four yuan per ton for lump coal, thirty-seven yuan for block coal, and thirty-nine yuan for premium block coal. The foreign warehouse charges extra for lighterage.</p>
<h3>Indian Coal Arrives Continuously</h3>
<p>Indian coal is arriving one after another. The Baron Jedburyh, managed by Jardine Matheson, transported 6,625 tons of coal from Calcutta and arrived at Wusong Port the day before yesterday afternoon. As there was no vacant space at the docks inside the Huangpu River, it anchored outside the port to wait. According to the company, it will only be able to enter the port on the 16th. Roughly, docks 34 and 35 will be available for berthing. Furthermore, the King Egbert, also managed by Jardine Matheson, transported 7,750 tons of coal from Calcutta and is expected to arrive in Shanghai next Wednesday (the 19th). The Helga Moller (also managed by Jardine Matheson) transported 7,450 tons of coal from Calcutta and is expected to enter the port around the 20th. The three ships together carry 21,825 tons.

<h3>Imports and Exports: Large Quantities of Food Transported to South China</h3>
<p>Tomorrow (the 17th), a large quantity of food will be transported to South China. This includes five hundred bags of flour to Weihaiwei, another six thousand bags, four hundred and seventy bags of beans, and ten cases of egg yolk and white to Xiamen. Goods transported to Hong Kong include one hundred bags of beans and twenty-eight cases of egg yolk and white.</p>

<h3>Adding Railings at Yu Garden to Prevent Drowning</h3>
<p>Yu Garden in Shanghai, with its pavilions, terraces, and towers, has everything. It also has artificial hills of piled stones and ponds dug into the ground, with canals bringing in water to fill them, surrounding various places, and bridges are built to connect them. However, the ponds are deep and wide, and apart from the Nine-Bend Railing, the other areas are not built up. After the chaos of war, it is said that there are drowning ghosts in the ponds, often misleading passersby. It was not often seen in the past few years, but since the beginning of summer this year, it has happened several times. Two days before the Dragon Boat Festival, as the evening sun was setting, there were still many passersby; and in front of Cui Xiu Hall, the open space was wide and spacious. A storyteller who always performed there was just starting his performance, and no fewer than a hundred people were standing around listening. Suddenly, a man, not yet old, walked straight down towards Cui Xiu Hall, leisurely into the center of the water, then he was floating and sinking. Those who saw it knew that something was wrong and gathered the listeners to pull him out. They asked him why this happened, but he was confused and did not understand. Among them, someone who knew that he lived near the temple sent him home. The rest continued listening to the storyteller as before. Before half an hour had passed, another person... and people rescued him. After carefully asking the reason, the person was not rambling and said, "I heard someone calling my name in front of the Lakeside Pavilion, and I saw a road without water in the pond, so I went forward. I did not expect it to be a pond." The gentlemen of the former Smallpox Bureau donated funds to set up street lamps to guide passersby, precisely to prevent accidental drowning. All parts of the garden are managed by various guilds. Cui Xiu Hall is managed by the Bean Guild, Dian Chun is managed by the Flower Candy Guild, and the Inner Garden is managed by the Money Guild. There is also a newly built Wine Guild. There are also various guilds for cloth and grain, and there are also guilds for iron and other industries that make decisions. There are seven large guilds and several smaller ones. It is estimated that building railings will cost four hundred thousand "wen," so each guild will contribute no more than several tens of thousands of "wen." Each guild spends several hundred thousand "wen" on annual banquets each year. Now, if they slightly reduce their expenses, they can use this donation to build railings, which would save a life and be more virtuous than building a seven-story pagoda.</p>

<h3>Utilizing the Vacation to Experience Life</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Looking around, the children are all enjoying their summer vacation. Summer vacation must feel pleasant for you; you no longer have to wipe the sweat from your brow while sucking on your brush in the classroom and writing dictation. You no longer have to stare wide-eyed at the difficult arithmetic problems on the blackboard, desperately trying to figure them out. The teachers no longer require you to hand in homework on time. In any case, you have temporarily escaped the constraints of school rules. You play freely at home, although your parents inevitably have to teach you some homework, writing, or reviewing. I think you will not be more afraid of your parents than of your teachers.</p>
<p>However, I strongly disapprove of you spending the entire summer vacation of several dozens of days playing. On the contrary, you can take advantage of this longer vacation to experience various aspects of life. Perhaps you will find it more interesting and beneficial than studying. For example, if your father is a mechanical engineer, you might ask him to take you to a machine factory to see what it's like. You will surely discover many mechanical wonders and the hard work of the workers. For example, if your father is the manager of a trading company, you can also ask to visit his office. You will easily find out how business is done and what kind of etiquette and skills a businessman must have. … There are of course many other examples; there is no need to list them all.</p>
<p>Perhaps you will protest, "We are still in school, why should we do things outside of our duties?" This is completely the simple-minded and innocent tone of you children. But you must know that calling you to experience life is precisely to enable you to acquire various kinds of knowledge outside of books and to help you improve your studies. Books are just dead photographs, while real life is a moving picture. Children; moving pictures must be more interesting and understandable than dead photographs, right?</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would like to present an example: a friend of mine once worked as a proofreader in a newspaper office. Later, he entered a journalism school, and he did the best in the class in various papers because he wrote down all the experiences of working in the newspaper office. And other students can only circle around the scope of the books. Children, summer vacation is a good opportunity. Everyone, take advantage of it!</p>
<h3>American Children Learn to Use Chopsticks</h3>
<p>— Ming Chu</p>
<p>A Chinese restaurant in New York's Chinatown recently held a luncheon for Chinese and American children, and many Chinese and foreigners also attended, creating a lively scene. This luncheon was part of the American Medical Aid to China sponsorship program. More than fifty children participated that day, all accompanied by their mothers, and they dispersed after two hours of enjoyment. According to Mrs. Zhu, who was in charge of the preparations, the luncheon had two purposes. First, it hoped to promote understanding and friendship between the Chinese and American people through this gathering. Second, all the proceeds would be used to purchase medical supplies and donate them to Chinese refugees to alleviate their suffering. Before the meal, Mrs. Zhu gave a brief speech, discussing Chinese culture and comparing American culture with Chinese culture, and then asked everyone present to donate a certain amount to show their support.</p>
<p>Of course, many American children were tasting Chinese food for the first time, and they all looked very curious when the waiters brought the dishes one after another. The food they ate included bird's nest chicken soup egg rolls, stir-fried vegetables with almond chicken, braised duck with chestnuts, shrimp egg, sweet and sour pork ribs, white rice, almond cookies, assorted fruits, and Chinese tea. What made these children most curious was the pair of long chopsticks. After an explanation, they either tapped the chopsticks on the table or made bridges and played other games before trying to use them to eat. Several Chinese children, like Mrs. Zhu, were also explaining the use of chopsticks to American children, but those American children tried and tried and never knew how to do it, so they had to imitate others and use them reluctantly. However, they soon used knives and forks again. There was also an American child who first used a fork to put the food on the chopsticks and then put it in his mouth. The Chinese and foreigners who attended this gathering were all very satisfied.</p>
<h3>Saying Earth</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>——Ming Er's Refugee Record Twenty-Five——</p>
<p>All the way passed Yangxi, Gangkou, and Chun'an, these are all towns and counties in Zhejiang, they have crossed countless rapids and shoals, like ten thousand horses galloping down, and then it is calm and still all the way! Three or five little crows chirped, and their clear singing seemed to comfort them for the hardships of wind and waves, and also seemed to sing praises for their victory. But good times don't last long. After a while, there was another roar of mountains and rivers cracking, and the poor Jiang's boats struggled in the heart of the river. Passing through shoal after shoal like this, the terrain became higher and higher. The boatmen fought the crazy waves with their solid bodies and strong courage, and finally defeated their limited brute force, but the price paid by the boatmen was also quite considerable—sweat all over their bodies. They travel back and forth across the river all year round, enduring the impact of wind, frost, rain and snow, and experiencing the journey of thousands of mountains and rivers. Such a life drifting on the water is really too hard.</p>
<p>"Is this river still the Xin'an River?" At this time, the Jiangshan boat passed another shoal. The boatman, covered in sweat, took off his clothes, leaving only an undershirt, and rested on the bow - of course, smoking. Ming'er strolled out of the cabin shrouded in a fearful atmosphere, took a long, turbid breath, and unknowingly chatted with the boatman.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's right, this is the Xin'an River." The boatman secretly felt a little disgusted by Ming'er's questioning, and answered loudly like a joke. But this is also not to blame Ming'er, because it was the first time he had passed through here. "Why are there so many shoals in this river?" Ming'er always liked to "break the casserole and ask to the end" and kept asking.</p>
<p>"Are you a student and don't know? Although I haven't studied, I understand very well that this is because the upper reaches are high. You see that there are high mountains all around, which is proof. How can the water not be rapid when it rushes down from a high place? And the Xin'an River is exactly in a slanted place, so there are many shoals. Speaking of which, I'll tell you an interesting thing: don't be surprised, the terrain here is higher than the three-story building in Hangzhou." The boatman also talked incessantly. Ming'er heard a long speech from the boatman like a lecture, and was very unconvinced in his heart, so he retorted:</p>
<p>"How do you know that the terrain here is higher than Hangzhou? You don't have a thousand-mile eye, how can you see Hangzhou?" "It's also easy to understand, you think, we have already passed more than a dozen shoals, and every time we pass a shoal, we rise about three or four feet, so if you calculate it, my words can be believed, right?" The boatman presented real evidence, which made Ming'er speechless. Fortunately, Ming'er's father came out of the cabin at this time. He didn't come to mediate, because he was sitting all day long and was really bored. Just when Ming'er and the boatman were arguing fiercely, he walked out of the cabin and interrupted their debate.</p>
<p>"Boatman, how many days will it take to get to Tunxi?" Ming'er's father asked the boatman. "Sir, it will take about four or five days. Tomorrow we can enter Anhui Province."</p>
<p>Ming'er took this opportunity to sneak into the cabin. He secretly thanked his father for giving him a time to step down. "Otherwise, what's the use? The boatman is not easy to mess with. I'm going to Anhui Province tomorrow. What's the difference between it and Jiangsu and Zhejiang? Ha, I'll see tomorrow!"</p>
<h3>"Changing Our New Clothes"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Zuo</p>
<h3>From Coins to Paper Money</h3>
<p>— Chun Lu</p>
<p>In the past, the currency circulating in our country was cast from two metals: silver and copper. There were four types of silver coins: one yuan, half yuan, double "jiao", and single "jiao"; there were two types of copper coins: ten copper yuan and one "wen" coins. However, exchanging copper coins for silver coins, or silver yuan for silver "jiao", could not be calculated in decimal terms. It had to be converted according to the market price, which was very troublesome.</p>
<p>In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, because the United States was buying silver, the price of silver was very high. Common greedy merchants transported the silver out to make money. In this way, there was less currency circulating in our country. When there is less currency, the prices of various goods fall, and the profits of industry and commerce also decrease, so many factories stopped work and shops closed. On November 4, our government implemented a new currency system: designating the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications as "legal tender" for circulation. All cash was concentrated in the "Issuing Reserve Management Committee" and was not allowed to be used.</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned legal tender as the standard currency, on January 11 of the twenty-fifth year, the National Government also stipulated that nickel coins and copper coins should be used as subsidiary coins, all calculated decimally. There are now three types of nickel coins in circulation: twenty "fen", ten "fen", and five "fen"; there are two types of copper coins: one "fen" and half "fen". They are all cast by the Central Mint and issued by the Central Bank.</p>
<p>After the Anti-Japanese War, copper subsidiary coins almost disappeared from the market due to the invaders' plunder. At present, one legal tender yuan can only be exchanged for sixty to seventy subsidiary coins and is not easy to exchange. Therefore, the general public in the country all hope that the National Bank will issue a kind of "fen" denomination subsidiary currency, like the Zhejiang local bank currency issued by Zhejiang Province, which can be circulated nationwide. Then, our currency will completely change from coins to paper money, that is, from the period of using gold to the period of credit.</p>
<h3>Outer Mongolia</h3>
<p>— By Tian</p>
<p>Outer Mongolia is located in the northern part of our country, geographically classified as the Mongolian Plateau. It covers a vast area, but most of it is a desolate Gobi Desert. Only the northern part has lush water and grass, and ample rainfall, making it very suitable for animal husbandry. Therefore, the greatest resource of Outer Mongolia is livestock. To the north of Outer Mongolia lies Russian Siberia. Due to Outer Mongolia's geographical proximity to Russia, the relationship between them is particularly complex.</p>
<p>Since the Russo-Japanese War, Russia's influence in the three northeastern provinces has been greatly weakened. Therefore, it had to find other targets for aggression, and Outer Mongolia, which was close at hand, caught its attention. In the year of the Xinhai Revolution, Russia took advantage of the chaos in the late Qing Dynasty and instructed the Living Buddha of Outer Mongolia to declare independence, calling it the Great Mongolian State. Russia then, under the pretext of assisting independence, signed a treaty with Outer Mongolia, obtaining various special privileges. Thus, Outer Mongolia became a dependency of Russia. After the establishment of the Republic of China, several negotiations with Russia yielded no results. It was not until 1915 that the Sino-Russian-Mongolian Agreement was signed, recognizing Outer Mongolia's autonomy, while Russia and Outer Mongolia recognized China's suzerainty over Outer Mongolia. The disputes between China, Russia, and Mongolia were temporarily resolved for several years. In 1917, the Russian Revolution broke out, and the Russians were unable to look eastward. Therefore, they stopped supporting the autonomous government of Outer Mongolia. At the same time, the invasion of the White Russians made the situation dangerous. Therefore, the Mongolian princes requested the Chinese government to provide protection. The government then sent troops to Outer Mongolia, and after the chaos was quelled, stationed troops in Kulun. At the same time, the Living Buddha and princes of Outer Mongolia realized the impracticality of autonomy, and in 1919, they voluntarily abolished autonomy and became a formal administrative region of our country. However, in 1921, Russian students in Outer Mongolia and a generation of ambitious princes formed an organization called the Mongolian People's Party, and with the support of Russia, they defeated Kulun, abolished the Living Buddha, and established the Mongolian People's Government. In 1924, the Mongolian People's Republic was formally established, and all its political organizations and systems completely imitated Russia. Although Outer Mongolia nominally declared independence, all political, military, financial, and diplomatic powers were controlled by the Russians and subject to their domination. Thus, Outer Mongolia almost became a part of Russia again. However, Russia, fearing that this would harm the relations between China and Russia, signed a treaty with our country in the same year, again recognizing China's suzerainty over Outer Mongolia. Since then, Outer Mongolia has grown day by day under this semi-independent state, and all political affairs, military preparations, transportation, agriculture, industry, and commerce have advanced rapidly along with Russia. At the same time, Outer Mongolia has always maintained a friendly and sympathetic attitude towards its mother country, China, and has become an important bridge between China and Russia.</p>
<h3>Among the Beasts (9)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>At that time, those beasts accompanied Peng Qi as they walked, and shouted, "Let's let him open his eyes and see our skills!" So a group of clever-eyed otters, with dark faces, as bright as Knox, immediately led Peng Qi to their dwelling place, to show him how to use their sharp teeth to cut down, or pick up the lumber floating on the water. It turned out that every spring, trees cut down in American forests were often thrown into the river, allowing them to flow downstream. The otters intercepted them, using their skills, and built dwellings one after another. While Peng Qi was visiting, a small water insect nearby also invited him to visit their dwelling. Although it was very small, it showed that they had also put in a lot of effort and were very skillful. All the walls were made of rubble, colorful and very beautiful.</p>
<p>In another small stream, there was a strong-looking small stickleback swimming around its barrel-shaped nest, acting as a guard. It proudly invited Peng Qi to visit their nest-building achievements.</p>
<p>After Peng Qi had seen it, his interest was attracted by the mud city built by the ants. He saw winding corridors, infinitely ingenious. He could not have imagined that such small creatures could achieve such miracles. In addition, he visited the rooms of the bumblebees and admired their diligence. At this moment, an invitation card was sent from an oyster shell on the seashore, inviting Peng Qi to visit the dwellings of the marine worms. The forms of these dwellings were each beautiful, but each different. Every family and every tribe had its own style. Although usually it was necessary to use a microscope to see them clearly, in this realm of beasts, it was only necessary to use the naked eye to see them clearly.</p>
<p>Soon, invitation cards flew in one after another. The sociable sandpipers invited him to visit their city in the distant woods. The field mice also welcomed him to their village. Every mouse sat on its small house, earnestly welcoming the distinguished guest. A flock of crows invited him to attend a solemn gathering. Sentries were placed on every tree, waiting for him to approach step by step.</p>
<p>A spider, like a clever and experienced mechanical engineer, was willing to show Peng Qi how to spin a web. He hurriedly said, "Listen carefully, for example, you are now ready for everything and are about to start working. First, you have to choose a suitable location and decide at which point to install your first thread. Of course, you have a ball of silk hidden in your body, don't you?"</p>
<h3>Ant War</h3>
<p>— Cheng Ming</p>
<p>Among insects, what is good at group organization and good at warfare? It's ants. They are hardworking people under a public ownership system. Although their individual strength is weak, their collective strength surpasses everything. They also have a brave spirit of unity and resistance to foreign enemies. They are the most excellent and reasonable community dwellers. May the children take ants as a model for life. What about the ant's war situation? Rarely seen in records.</p>
<p>I remember that in the London Zoo, there was once a fierce ant war that lasted for four days and nights before the victory or defeat was determined. The audience was like a wall, and the newspapers also published the matter every day, causing a city-wide sensation. At that time, a naturalist, Sir Lubbock, witnessed it personally and recorded it in the most detail. Now, I will briefly record the general situation of the ant war as follows:</p>
<p>In the zoo, a tribe of ants had already lived by the stream. Later, a newly arrived tribe moved to the opposite bank. But the stream was separated, and there was no contact, so there was no reason for disputes. One day, a nosy gardener erected a wooden stick on the stream, so the ants of the two nests had the opportunity to come into contact.</p>
<p>At this time, it happened that an ant from the old nest was walking by the stream and saw the wooden stick. He went ashore along the wooden stick and was suddenly discovered by the ants of the new nest. He was surrounded, attacked, and killed, and could not survive.</p>
<p>When this bad news reached the old nest, there was an immediate commotion. Everyone ran around telling each other, and everyone showed an angry expression, but there was absolutely no disorderly behavior. After a while, more than ten brave and good fighters were sent across the bridge to spy on the enemy nest to find out the truth. At this time, the ants of the new nest all hid in their holes. The ants of the old nest could not find out the details, so they turned back to report. At this time, according to the observation of people, they must be holding a military meeting, right? A few minutes later, the entire warrior came out in single file, ready to cross the wooden stick and rush straight to the enemy's nest, with the ambition to "destroy this enemy before eating breakfast." At the same time, the worker ants carried sand along the way to act as a strategy for advancing and retreating.</p>
<p>At the other end of the wooden stick, two ants from the new nest were guarding. Seeing the enemy invading, one immediately ran back to report. A few seconds later, the entire team also came out. There were about several thousand soldiers on both sides.</p>
<p>As soon as the two armies came into contact, they bit with their mouths and resisted with their feet, fierce and unusual, fighting to seize and kill the enemy, advancing one after another. Some died on the battlefield with broken feet and necks; others were forced and drowned in the stream. After fighting for four days and nights, the ants of the old nest could not support and retreated. When they crossed the wooden stick, they were too crowded because the position was too narrow, and countless people fell into the water and died! After the war continued to the second day, there was a two-hour break in the middle, and the two sides exchanged messages. According to people's speculation, they were probably discussing the terms of the truce. Unfortunately, the peace talks failed, and the war started again.</p>
<p>Children, you see, they have marching plans and combat methods. What is the difference between them and humans? The ants of the old nest refused to surrender, it is really glorious even in defeat!</p>
<h3>Teasing Cool Tea</h3>
<p>— Zi Xi</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, we are now in the hot summer season. Naturally, a few noble ladies can stroll into the cool and comfortable ice-drinking room and immerse themselves for a few hours. Anyway, they are members of the leisure class. Only the vast majority of toiling masses, for the sake of life, are running around all day long. Neither time nor economics allow them to immerse themselves in ice-drinking rooms. Therefore, there are some enthusiastic benefactors who, in order to reduce the thirst and heat of those toiling masses, have set up cool tea buckets along the road for free drinking, benefiting people. It's really not shallow, but recently there are often a few naughty children who not only do not do things that are beneficial to the people, but are doing rascally deeds that harm others and do not benefit themselves, such as often teasing the cool tea. Some use cool tea to wash their hands and faces; some use cool tea to sprinkle on people at will; some open the cool tea bucket switch and run away, letting it flow continuously on the ground; some three or five children use lead cans or the like to hold cool tea and fight each other; some use unclean cloth corners and paper heads to fill the switch openings, etc., all kinds of hateful naughty actions, and so on. In short: it is of no benefit to the teasers; it is of great harm to the users. This kind of fact is often seen. I would like to use the space of this publication to inform the readers of this publication, hoping that you will persuade them at any time and promote them in various ways, and strive to jointly maintain the original intention of giving cool tea to benefit the people. Anyway, teasing cool tea is a shameless act that harms others and does not benefit oneself, and it really hurts one's personality.</p>

<h3>Please Hire Refugees First</h3>
<p>— Xue Wen</p>
<p>Introduction Group of Refugee Relief Association</p>
<p>Currently, There are Various Technical Talents</p>
<p>and Will Add Civilian Factories</p>
<p>Training Class is Teaching Refugees</p>
<p>The broadcasting and charity sales for the summer hygiene funds for refugees these two days seem to be very lively, which shows that there are still many enthusiastic people in Shanghai. They are always able to spare a little energy to help the refugees in their comfortable environment.</p>
<p>But in addition to the passive "fundraising" and "donation" to keep tens of thousands of refugees in shelters, it does not seem to be a solution. Therefore, every refugee relief association in Shanghai has a production and education facility plan, hoping to enable refugees "without special skills" to learn a specialized skill in a short period of time under planned guidance.</p>
<p>But in fact, among the refugees, there are indeed those who have received middle and higher education in the past. For example, in the Western Allotment Road International Shelter, there are three university students; and in the office of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, there are also many staff members promoted from the refugees, which shows that there is no shortage of available talents in the shelters. If we can choose, they may be the most efficient workers.</p>
<p>Divided into Three Groups</p>
<p>In order to enable refugees to obtain a more stable life, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has specially established a job introduction group to register the specialized talents of each refugee and is responsible for introducing them to various factories.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter went to the relief association at 93 Guangdong Road to visit their aftercare office. Chen 　Mo, the director of the education department, talked with the reporter in detail about the organization process of the job introduction group and the current situation:</p>
<p>In order to make the refugees a direct producer, the relief association has specially established three groups: the first group is the job introduction group; the second group is the evacuation group; the third group is the production and construction group.</p>
<p>Let's put aside the second and third groups for the time being. Now let the reporter, based on Mr. Chen 　Mo's conversation, focus on the "job introduction group."</p>
<p>Refugees Can Register</p>
<p>The job introduction group was established in November last year and has been established for half a year. When it was first registered, there were more than 2,000 people. Until now, more than 300 people have been introduced.</p>
<p>As soon as they were established, they formed a cooperative relationship with the industrial promotion department of the Ministry of Works and conducted them to various factories.</p>
<p>Their registration does not limit the refugees of the relief association. That is, if other shelters have refugees who claim to have specialized skills, they can go to the Guangdong Road Association to register</p>
<p>The registration procedure is very simple and does not charge any fees. Just fill out a form at the association.</p>
<p>This registration form is called "job application registration form." After the association receives the registration form, it conducts a survey in the shelter to see if the various facts filled in the form are true.</p>
<p>Monthly Allowance of One Yuan</p>
<p>After the investigation, a further assessment is carried out. The association sends staff to assess the registered refugees. If it is considered that the assessment is passed, the identity of this job-seeking refugee is confirmed after detailed notation on the assessment form.</p>
<p>If the job has been successfully introduced during this time, the association must first give various practical guidance and fill out a volunteer form.</p>
<p>Refugees with jobs are in a trial period for one to three months at the beginning. During this short period, the employer only provides food and accommodation without paying wages.</p>
<p>In order to reward refugees with jobs, the relief association specially subsidizes transportation costs of one yuan during the trial period. Although this one yuan is a small amount, the significance of this reward is worth promoting.</p>
<p>Must Intensify Training</p>
<p>According to the results of the statistics at the end of April last year. The number of registered people was 704, and the highest number in the statistics table was the male and female workers of the yarn factory, with 118 people. The second was the male and female workers of the cigarette factory, with 50 people. The rest were in order, with 40 peddlers, 33 printers, 31 store clerks, and others including coppersmiths, blacksmiths, cooks, and tailors. The smallest number was water workers, etc., the types cannot be said to be many.</p>
<p>From May to July, in these two months, the number of registered people was 226. The female workers of the yarn factory and the female workers of the tin foil factory were the most, one was 50 people and the other was 40 people. Others included 20 workers from the sock factory, 15 printing workers, and specialized technical talents, including one driver of a car and two male workers from the hinge factory. Although other private employees accounted for 80 people, they did not have special skills.</p>
<p>From these two statistical tables, the first statistical table can still show an average of various types of talents in the shelter, while the second statistical table shows that the refugees without a skill accounted for more than one-third. Therefore, for the current refugees, training must be intensified.</p>
<p>Establish Civilian Factories</p>
<p>According to my previous conversation with Mr. Chen and the statistical table showing that most of the job-seeking refugees do not have special skills, it has been decided to establish a large-scale civilian factory in the production and construction group, and it has been decided that Mr. Yu Zuoting and Mr. Xiang Kangyuan will be responsible for carrying it out. We hope that this plan can be realized quickly.</p>
<p>Secondly, under the education department, a work training group has also been established. Under this group, several specialized skill training classes have been opened, such as radio, soap, chemical engineering, etc., some of which graduate in one month, and some of which graduate in half a year. Although the first phase of these training classes has not yet graduated, under this orderly and planned process, it is much simpler for the refugees than any other method of education and production.</p>
<h3>Recent Works of Ms. Chen Keming</h3>
<h3>Biographies of Female Storytellers</h3>
<p>— Shen You</p>
<p>Female Storytellers Known for Their "Beauty"</p>
<p>At that time, there were also four people, namely Wang Youjuan, Xu Yayun, Huang Aiqing, and Chen Peiqing. Chi Pingsou commented: "Youjuan is the younger sister of Lijuan. Her talent is inferior to her sister, but her appearance is superior to her sister, and her art is equal to her sister. Xu Yayun is the daughter of Xu Baoyu. She is quiet, has a dignified appearance, speaks little, and has a girlish air. Her singing is also clear and melodious. Aiqing and Peiqing are both beautiful and have been married. Aiqing, I once saw her carrying a small bamboo tube of about an inch and playing with it, smiling sweetly, like a baby. She is innocent and romantic, and it is lovable. Peiqing is deeply in love and has a close alliance with Shi Sheng. Later, a wealthy person bought her, and her mother had already agreed. Shi Sheng cried, and Peiqing also cried. Her mother followed her will and finally returned the money and married Sheng." The matter of Peiqing described in the article is not exhaustive. The result of the development is actually a tragedy. "Hai Zou Ye You Fu Lu" records it in the most detail. The article says:</p>
<p>Peiqing's surname is Chen, and her first name is Xiaobao. She is intelligent and has a particularly beautiful appearance. Yao Ruilan in Tongqingli taught her songs, but Ji Yiran disdained to learn them... Jumeixuan outside Xiaodongmen, every July, all storytellers, regardless of gender, will meet here and perform a skill. If they do not attend the meeting, they will not be allowed to enter the storytelling field. Also, according to the precedent, the first to arrive will perform first, and the songs that have been performed shall not be sung again. Ji arrived the latest, and the books she had learned were all said by others first, and she almost had nothing to perform. She returned and devoted herself to music, and in less than two months, her art greatly improved and her name became famous. Among the famous flowers in Shanghai who have both beauty and talent, Ji should be the first. ...</p>
<p>This is about Peiqing's art, and her theory seems to be higher than that of Chi Pingsou, who only takes "beauty". As for her life experience, it is the same as that of Shi Sheng as described by Sou. However, Sou only describes the matter until Peiqing and Shi Sheng are combined. The subsequent development into a tragedy has not been mentioned, presumably because the article was completed earlier. "Hai Zou Ye You Suo Lu" continues to record:</p>
<p>... At first, it was thought that the harmony of the phoenixes was not suitable for Yunlu, and the shadow of the emeralds was not suitable for 　Ming. In two years, she gave birth to two sons in a row, and people celebrated for her. However, the scholar was limitless, and his virtue was variable. Shi Sheng was outside and had an affair with Xu Xiaobao. He did not return for two months. Ji's face was full and her body was weak, standing tall like a hibiscus in the early sun. After giving birth, she was out of tune, and she was depressed. In a few months, the disease entered the bone marrow. She wanted to invite Shi Sheng to see her and say goodbye, but she could not get it. She called Shi Lang and said that he betrayed me and died. Shi Sheng returned, from which it can be known that his outline is that his personal history is a wonderful storytelling. The matter of Youjuan cannot be examined. Hanjiang Cike has a poem to her: "Youjuan is extremely intelligent, and her shallow smile and light frown are even more pitiful. Her weak body cannot bear too much thinness, and she should not stand in front of the wind." However, it is actually a general work. Mian Chi Daoren's "Jie Hong Xue Ci Ti Er Shi Si Nu Pin Hua Tu" (Shen Bao,) once compared her to "Begonia" and "Drunk Woman," and commented on her as "The silver candle shines on her cheeks, and Yu Huan wakes up with a dream like smoke." However, what he gave was still an ambiguous impression. Wang 　recorded her sister Lijuan and said:</p>
<p>Lijuan's surname is Wang, and she grew up under Yushan Mountain. Her personality is idle and miscellaneous, and her demeanor is light and graceful. Her kind of Qing Jiao and unconventional outline is awe-inspiring and difficult to offend. ... Her register belongs to Qinchuan, the old family of Langya, and she also came here after being displaced by the war. She lost her mother when she was young, and her father did not engage in any business. An old woman named Ren took her to Shanghai, and she relied on her for washing and sewing. Living as a guest, she had no way to make a living, so she followed a teacher to learn songs and used them to make a living. ...</p>
<p>If Youjuan is really a sister to Lijuan, her experiences should be similar. Xu Yayun, Hanjiang Cike also has a poem for her, and it more clearly outlines her outline. The poem says: "Xu Yayun, with phoenix eyes and moth eyebrows, stands tall like a crane among chickens. Wu Niang's twilight rain Xiao Xiao song, I will hear it again when I return to Jiangnan." Her 　is also difficult to examine. "Hai Shang Qun Fang Pu" (1884) Volume II, there is a biography of Xu Yaxian, saying that Yaxian is a native of Gusu, with the original surname Zhu, a good family woman, who learned Southern lyrics from Xu Baoyu, so she followed the surname Xu. She has bright eyes and white teeth, smooth skin and soft bones, a plain face and light makeup, and her spirit is clear and her skin is clean, 　the category of a national husband. 　I don't know if "Yaxian" is a changed name for "Yayun". Also, the author of "Ci Yuan Surname Record" Yun 　Meng 　Factory owner has "Jin Lu Qu Zeng Xu Qingyun Ci Shi Ci" saying:</p>
<p>The young phoenix is ​​petite, and when she watches the scene, her pearly throat and silvery nails sound wonderful. 　She puts the golden hairpin into the treasure hairpin, and she is already working hard 　 Yanxiao. What's more, her mother Xu Niang is not old, and she is good at Su Zhangkou in the literary world, and she is happy that there is a daughter 　at the same time. The tongue of the warbler turns, competing to steal cleverness. 　Yunying used to be a shocking look, 　Pipa Yingying's naive attitude, and her eyebrows are lightly swept (referring to her sister Yayun.) The sisters are not clear, and their distant mountains are as green as the Xiao. I also count the setbacks in the love field, and I am idle to evaluate the price in the dust (the recent compilation of the Ci Yuan surname record will be completed,) and add the fragrance name to the black silk manuscript. Throw the pen up, only long Xiao.</p>
<p>The words describe Yayun, which is quite similar to Yaxian. And from this, we can know that Yayun also has a younger sister, named Qingyun, who is also a lovable child. Huang Aiyun, in addition to Chi Pingsou's theory, there is nothing to be examined. "Shanghai Nan Bei Zhu Zhi Ci" said: "A song of Pipa tilts the four seats, and the beauty is also called Mr. Among them, who is the most outstanding? Wu Suqing and Huang Aiqing." I don't know if "Aiqing" is "Aiqing"? (Eight)</p>
<h3>The Soul Returns to Wuthering Heights</h3>
<p>— Ru Hua</p>
<p>“Wuthering Heights”</p>
<p>"The Soul Returns to Wuthering Heights" is a famous novel by the British female writer Brontë. This heart-wrenching tragedy reflects the unbreakable class concepts of the time to a certain extent. On the other hand, it also illustrates that everyone should prioritize their own career. For example, Hindley, who had always despised Heathcliff since childhood, eventually sold his property to Heathcliff, who he had insulted, due to his own decline. However, Cathy's words, "Leave me, pursue your future," actually strengthened their passionate love. Heathcliff's later separation from Cathy was also out of resentment after being heartbroken. Therefore, what we see is naturally only a heart-wrenching tragedy.</p>
<p>"The Soul Returns to Wuthering Heights" uses the flashback method. I don't know if it's to be faithful to the original work, but I think this is not the best method in the film. This reduces the power of the final climax, and the explanations of each scene by the old woman Ellen also prevent the emotions of the entire play from being closely linked together.</p>
<p>Naturally, the achievements of the director William Wyler in handling each scene cannot be ignored. First: he grasped the personalities of Hindley and Heathcliff. One relies on his own position to look down on everything; the other endures all the pain for love, and only becomes perverted and willful when disappointed, which is written very vividly from beginning to end. Second: he wrote three scenes of Heathcliff and Cathy meeting on the mountain peaks, and wrote three different environments. The first time was the joy of their childhood fantasies, the second time was the comfort in pain, and the third time was even more passionate love, echoing each other and being deeply moving. Third: In the two scenes where Cathy chases Heathcliff in the heavy rain and the last scene where Cathy dies in Heathcliff's arms, his subtlety and touchingness should be the two most wonderful scenes in the entire film.</p>
<p>Merle Oberon's Cathy strives to tear her clothes, chase to the top of the mountain, run in the heavy rain, and die smiling on the sickbed. Laurence Olivier's Heathcliff can clearly grasp the personality of each changing period, his strength, patience, and willfulness.</p>
<p>Photography and music also contributed a lot. The former, such as the heavy wind and snow at the beginning, the gloom in the old house, the brightness of Cathy and Heathcliff harvesting wheat, and the loveliness of their old haunts in the depths of the white clouds at the end, are all vivid and lovely. The latter, such as the heavy thunderstorm when Heathcliff breaks his finger, strengthens Heathcliff's anger; the low music when Cathy is dying strengthens the desolate atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Chen Dieye Sells Paintings</h3>
<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>Why is a scholar esteemed? The one who earns a living through his own labor is the highest, others are secondary. Why is a scholar esteemed? The one who successfully completes his career is the highest, others are secondary. Wealth or poverty is irrelevant, but the world exclusively values those with wealth and assets, regarding those who complete their careers and earn a living through their own labor without pursuing wealth as insignificant. Therefore, if one focuses on a single profession in the morning but cannot become wealthy, then by evening, he will change to another path to try to eliminate his poverty. Scholars do not specialize in learning, merchants do not specialize in commerce, artisans do not specialize in skills, and farmers do not specialize in farming. The common people are in a state of anxiety, unable to complete their daily tasks. This is a major drawback. Still, without realizing it, what can I say? There are those who have already completed their careers but have not yet made a living from it. Although they are different from those who change their minds from morning to evening, their results are inevitably plagued by a lack of specialization. Therefore, I say that the scholar who specializes in his career and earns a living through his own labor is the highest. Chen Dieye is an old friend of mine for ten years. He is skilled in landscape and flower paintings but does not earn a living from his art. He was inspired by my words. He asked me for advice on what to do. I said, "Do what suits you." So, a price list was set: each fan leaf is fifteen yuan, each foot of a screen panel is ten yuan, a hanging scroll is double that, and a vertical scroll is fifteen yuan. This is not an excessive price. Regarding the value of paintings, the ancient times valued them more than the present. When Zhao Mingcheng saw Xu Xi's painting, he asked for a price of two hundred thousand qian, and still said it was cheap. A painting by Li Yingqiu was valued at one million. Today's painting prices are several tens of yuan per foot, and the world is already surprised. How different is that? It can be seen from this that painters are not valued today. However, painting is essential to the culture of a country. The world does not value it. For what reason? We need not discuss it for now. Those who specialize in this matter need not take this into account either, but simply pursue their goals and complete their careers. Chen Zi has already taken this as his mission, and his self-cultivation and adherence to his principles are commendable. Chen Zi, in landscape painting, strongly upholds the idea of the Yuan people, so his brushwork is ancient, vigorous, unrestrained, and lofty, possessing the excellence of Zi Jiu, Ze Min, Shan Qiao, and Fang Hu. Si Weng and Shi Xi are his forerunners in entering the Yuan style. In flower painting, he has gained the divine essence of Bai Yang and Bada. Chen Zi has traveled through the famous mountains and great rivers of the country eight or nine times, with over ten thousand books in his mind. His temperament is extraordinary, which is not accidental. When he initially announced his price list and requested paintings, I would like to serve as a go-between.</p>

<h3>Why is Peking Opera Not Considered Opera?</h3>
<p>— Xun Mo</p>
<p>I approve of "Westernization," but I do not advocate "complete" Westernization; I also approve of promoting Chinese native culture, but I do not advocate conservatism and adherence to convention. The culture of a country should not be isolated, but it cannot lose its unique character. Friends who are in favor of Westernization should simply be asked to go abroad, and elders who are bound by tradition should only be asked to go to museums. My view of Peking Opera has always been like this.</p>
<p>Some people do not allow Chinese Peking Opera to be included in the world's opera scene. Those who insist on this view will cite many Western theories to criticize Peking Opera to the point that it cannot be ranked. However, I cannot help but have doubts.</p>
<p>In terms of singing, Peking Opera's pronunciation, articulation, phrasing, and modulation, its intonation and tempo, not only have strict rules and regulations, but must also sing out the flavor within the strict rules and regulations. Why can't its value be found in music theory? Why must one straighten the voice like singing a foreign song, with a quiver in the straightness? There is really no reason to say why. A few years ago, I heard Mr. Du Tingxi use a singing method that conformed to the principles of vocal music, which to the layman sounded like singing a foreign song, to sing a section of "Empty City Stratagem" ("I was originally..."). I beg your pardon for saying this impolitely, but I really couldn't find some of the inherent flavor of Peking Opera. This is really superfluous.</p>
<p>In terms of dance, Peking Opera's postures, steps, every hand gesture, and every foot movement also have strict rules and regulations, and changes must be made within the strict rules and regulations. Why can't its value be found in dance theory? Why must one kick one's legs, bend one's arms, and spin one's body like dancing a foreign dance? There is really no reason to say why. Peking Opera emphasizes body movements and styles, which means conforming to standards and being beautiful. As for the water hair, beards, water sleeves, thick boots, and various different and difficult techniques such as stilt walking, why is none of them worth mentioning?</p>
<p>In terms of musical accompaniment, Peking Opera's stage is simple and not as complex as Western opera. However, it also has its unique style. Taking the huqin as an example, two strings can produce various tunes, setting off the different singing styles of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. Why are those who play the violin called musicians, while those who play the huqin are reduced to "teachers"? This kind of mentality is truly the epitome of self-contempt. Furthermore, the small gong, big gong, cymbals, and gongs, whether played solo or in ensemble, set off the various moods in the play. Why are they all without merit?</p>
<p>In terms of action and expression, in Peking Opera, from babies to the elderly, from emperors to civilians, from civil officials to military generals, from noble ladies to jade-like girls, each has its own merits. Those with superb acting skills, every frown, every smile, every word, and every move all have their norms, and all conform to reason and emotion. For example, the performance of a young female character expressing longing for spring is no less inferior to the most passionate love performance in foreign operas (please note: kissing and hugging in foreign operas are considered lewd and prohibited in Chinese society). Must one shout "I love you" with a trembling voice like in foreign operas to pass the test?</p>
<p>As for stage decorations and makeup costumes, if Chinese drama and foreign drama do not have to be exactly the same, then I still say that they have their own unique styles and even more so their own social backgrounds. Due to space limitations, I cannot discuss this in detail here. For example, the techniques of martial arts dramas, I ask, have you seen the flexible and rigid performances of foreign technical troupes? Putting one's hand on one's heart, are the Chinese ones inferior to the foreign ones?</p>
<p>Peking Opera is a Chinese folk art. We do not deny that it is still very immature and needs to be improved based on its inherent rules and regulations and in line with the trends of the times. I absolutely admit and advocate this. To say that Peking Opera has no value and should not be included in the world's opera scene, then I firmly protest and firmly oppose it.</p>
<p>Why is Peking Opera not considered opera?</p>
<h3>Quick News from the Liyuan in the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Yan Yan</p>
<p>Ping Opera's famous Dan actress, Xi Xingyun, who has the reputation of being an artist of the era, has been gaining popularity since her performance in Ping. Her new play "Liang Hongyu and Han Shizhong" has been a sensation for a long time, and people in Ping are also eager to feast their eyes and ears. According to reports, this play has been rehearsed for a long time, and the reason for the delay in its public performance is that the production of three-dimensional scenery was delayed, the tailoring of archaeological costumes was overdue, and the singing and acting of the supporting cast had not yet been mastered. Recently, it premiered at the New New Theater, and the seats were full. All those who came were well-known people of the time. It was truly unexpected that Xi Cailian would be so popular.</p>
<p>Cheng Jixian, the Taidou of Laosheng in Ludian Yiguang, has not performed for a long time since leaving Cheng Yanqiu's Qiu Sheng Troupe. There have been rumors of his comeback for some time. It was not until the evening of the 10th of this month that he performed "Linjiang Hui" with Li Hongchun at the Chang'an Theater. Before the play, there was Yang Baosen and Wang Quankui's "Beating the Drum and Scolding Cao," Zhu Guifang, Li Zhijiang, and Fan Baoting's "Qingshi Mountain," and Yu Lianxian's "Hezhu Pei." It is said that the attendance was still good. Given Cheng Jixian's age, it is no small feat to still form a troupe and perform. His old age is also not shallow.</p>
<p>Meng Xiaodong, the Kunling Xusheng, has been immersed in Zen and seclusion since apprenticing to Yu Shuyan, and has not performed for a long time. Now I hear that she is thinking of moving after being still for a long time and will perform in the near future. This matter is already in sight and will likely become a reality. The location is at the New New Theater, but the repertoire has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>The dignitaries of Ping City once again invited the famous Jing Jin Shaoshan to cooperate with Xi Xiaobo and Zhang Junqiu to perform a play. The repertoire is tentatively set as "Entering the Palace Twice," to be performed at the New New Theater on the 13th of this month. The front scene will feature Song Dezhu, Zhou Ruian, Tong Dexin, and others in "Pan Si Dong." Song will play the Spider Demon Yuexia Fairy, which will be a surprising move.</p>
<p>The Thirteenth Sister of the famous Dan Xun Huisheng has long been famous. Tongchang plays He Yufeng. Nai Zilingxiang learned this play from Wang Yaoqing and also plays He Yufeng. Therefore, some people asked his father and son to perform together. It was staged on the 10th of this month at the Jixiang Night Theater, with Lingxiang playing the Thirteenth Sister in the first scene and Zhang Jinfeng in the second scene. Huisheng played the Thirteenth Sister in the second scene, Jin Zhongren played An Xuehai, Jiang Shao Kui played Deng Jiugong, and Zhu Binxian played Sai Xishi.</p>
<p>After the play, "Six Kingdoms Conferring Prime Ministers," which was personally supported by Gao Shengkui in the past, achieved good results after its public performance and was deeply welcomed by the people of Ping. The second part has also been rehearsed and was performed on the 9th of this month at the Guanghe Painting Workshop, with Li Hezeng still playing Zhang Yi and Zhao Jinnian playing Su Qin. The plot and costumes are even more wonderful than the first part. Also, after Li Hongchun and Ding Yongli resigned from the drama school one after another, all the martial arts dramas that the students should learn are now taught by Fu Dewei and Wang Jinlu.</p>
<h3>Yang Xiaozhong Adapts "Tragedy on the Lake"</h3>
<p>— Yin Di</p>
<p>Tian Han's Famous Work of the Past Brought to the Screen</p>
<p>In the past, there was a famous drama performed in Nanguo Society, which was "Tragedy on the Lake" written by Tian Han. Later, Bu Wancang brought it to the screen at the Star Film Company, which seemed to be "Spring Dream by the Lake" starring Yang Naimei.</p>
<p>Now Yang Xiaozhong has also taken a fancy to this play by Tian Han and is working on adapting it into a movie script. It is said that the simple story has been reviewed and approved by the Xinhua Company. After Yang Xiaozhong's new work "The Pipa Story" is filmed, he plans to start filming this film, tentatively titled "Qian Nü You Hun," but the words "You Hun" (wandering soul) are not very appropriate, so it may be changed to "Qian Nü Li Hun" (Qian Nü's Soul Leaving Her Body).</p>
<p>Yang Xiaozhong intends to invite Chen Yunshang to play the heroine in this film. Chen Yunshang was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai around the 15th, but now it has been "postponed due to some matter." She is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 23rd or 24th.</p>
<h3>Singer Ms. Cheng Jingzi Broadcasted at the New Capital Hotel Yesterday</h3>
<p>— (Yong)</p>
<h3>One of Qilin Tong's Masterpieces — Beating Yan Song</h3>
<p>— Feng Zongying</p>
<p>Xin Fang's signature masterpieces are Shanghai-style plays, such as "Chasing Han Xin," "Qingfeng Pavilion," "Farewell Kiln," "Road Distant Knows Horsepower," and "Sweeping Pines and Lowering Books," which have always been known for their excellence. All of these plays require a lot of physical work, while the singing is secondary. I recall that a few years ago, I watched one of Xin Fang's masterpieces, "Beating Yan Song," and I am bringing it up again specifically.</p>
<p>In the play "Beating Yan Song," Xin Fang's Ying Long, paired with Shao Shan's Yan Song, has the beauty of red and green complementing each other. Xin Fang's dialogue is clear and refreshing, slow and methodical, and every word is articulated very accurately. As for the lines "Jiajing Ye, sitting on the throne...", when singing, there is absolutely no intermingling of florid embellishments, unlike Lian Liang's "Handsome Student," which uses florid embellishments to win the audience's applause. However, it is a pity that his voice is sandy and hoarse, but the sandiness has strength and authenticity, which is also excellent. When Ying Long goes to Yan Mansion and interacts with the doorman, both his acting and dialogue are excellent, and there are many cheers. However, Wu Bao's doorman's hoarse and low voice is not as fluent and smooth as those of Fu Lu and Chang Hua. After entering the mansion, he bows and pays respects with "One salute under the East Corner Gate, one bow under the West Corner Gate..." When singing the lines "...Standing on the steps of the palace, answer me if I ask," he walks to the edge of the stage, his cheeks flushed, his eyes wide with anger, his face full of scolding, his hands inserted behind his back, his robe corners raised, standing still like a truly angry person. In the section of the imperial decree on the throne with the second and sixth beat, he sings the whole section in one breath, especially the three words "Ba, ba, ba," the sound suddenly high and low, with varying degrees of emphasis, like cutting water with a knife, the sound suspended and stopped, making the audience below applaud like thunder. Shao Shan's dialogue has a lot of nasal sounds, and in the singing, the phrase "Three, six, nine days..." has a particularly fast transition. His golden voice is loud and clear, worthy of the sound of a great bell! Later, when opening the mountain mansion and beating Yan Song, the dialogue between Xin Fang and Shao Shan is smooth and refreshing to the point of perfection. When beating Yan Song, Shao Shan's being beaten seems to be unintentional, authentic, and Xin Fang's angry actions seem to truly vent his anger and repay past grudges, reaching the climax of the plot. When the play ends and the curtain closes, the Grand Tutor uses a small voice to say "Thank you" to Ying Long in the Shanghai dialect, which causes a burst of laughter from the audience.</p>
<p>Now Shao Shan is extremely popular in the north, and Xin Fang remains in Shanghai to perform various long plays. When will the two be able to perform together again? How many times will we be able to encounter such a great play? Thinking about it, I feel deeply moved.</p>

<h3>Skating Technique (82)</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Lian Jun Qi Zhen</p>
<p>One of the practice methods is to first move backward with both feet on the ground, and gradually lift one foot while moving, so that the moving foot exerts force on the outside of the shoe. Another practice method is to use the backward circular method. For example, when retreating to the right, cross the left foot in front of the right foot and to the right of the right foot, and make it land on the inside of the left shoe when landing. Rotate the center of gravity of the body left and right alternately. If the left foot uses the inside and the right foot uses the outside, the speed will increase. Practice until the right foot can travel independently.</p>
<p>4.  Inward Retreat</p>
<p>Stabilize the left foot, lift the right foot, the toes must be inward, and the heel should be as outward as possible. The left knee should be greatly bent, with a slight elastic force when pushing. At the same time, the right foot should land immediately and must land directly on the inside of the shoe. With practice, the left foot can naturally leave the ground lightly and gently. The buttocks must rotate together with the main leg and main shoulder. The opening step of inward retreat is inherently not very elegant, but if the guest knee can be greatly bent and have elastic force, it can also make it elegant.</p>
<p>In the first position of the body during inward retreat, the guest leg, guest arm, and guest shoulder follow the direction of the arc, and the guest leg is on the arc, while the main shoulder remains behind. Both shoulders start from the waist and are slightly outside the circle, and the head faces the main shoulder and the direction of movement.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the body's rotation to the second position, about halfway, the guest leg and guest buttocks are behind, and the shoulder remains the same. The head is now facing the center. When changing feet, the shoulder turns and passes the axis, and the right shoulder moves to the front. This method can make the body's position the same as when the right foot opens when the left foot opens. The main knee must always be greatly bent, especially before opening the step, so that it can be powerful. The above uses the first and second positions of the body. In the third position, the main shoulder and guest leg are in front of the body, and the guest shoulder and guest arm are behind. The head looks at the direction from which it came. This position is used after inward advance and swing. In the fourth position, the guest shoulder, arm, leg, and buttocks are all behind, and the head is facing the direction of movement and is inside the circle. Advanced skating such as (A) before the inward retreat reverse three-character turn, (B) after the outward advance three-character turn, and (C) after the inward retreat loop are all used.</p>
<p>There is also a method for opening the step of inward retreat, that is, using the inside of the right shoe, first cross it in front of the left foot and push, and then push the outside of the left shoe, which is the so-called crossing-foot method. According to this method, the main foot pushes first, which violates the rule that the opening step must start from a fixed position, so it is not allowed in competitions, but it is extremely useful for skating at ordinary times, because it can borrow a lot of force.</p>
<p>The inward retreat practice can be completely carried out according to the outward retreat method, that is, (A) retreating with both feet on the ground, (B) using the circular method, but not lifting the left foot but lifting the right foot, and using the inside of the left shoe to move. When the guest foot passes the main foot, if the main foot is straightened with force, the speed can be increased.</p>
<h3>News from the Performing Arts</h3>
<p>China-France Drama Society: The China-France Drama Society, hosted by the China-France Drama School, held a trial performance of its first public performance of "The True Story of Ah Q" the night before (the 14th) and invited people from all walks of life. It officially opened yesterday. It is reported that about 700 people from the literary, drama, film, and news circles attended the trial performance. The society's director, Feng Zhizhong, first gave a speech, and then the opening began, which did not end until 12 o'clock, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic, but the sixth act of the play was not performed due to the lateness of the hour.</p>
<p>Green Field Drama Troupe: The Green Field Drama Troupe at No. 405 Tianjin Road is an amateur organization of people who love drama and strongly advocate dramatic arts. It held its first public performance at the Xianle Grand Theater on the 18th of last month, and the results were very good. Recently, it was heard that the troupe will hold its second performance and plans to recruit male and female members in order to expand its organization and seek the development of drama affairs. Therefore, anyone who can speak Mandarin and loves dramatic arts is requested to bring a photo and register at Huaying Elementary School (at the intersection of Aiwenyi Road and Dahua Road) within three days from 3:30 pm to 5:30 pm every day.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from Liyuan</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Xu Biyun Violates Liyuan's White Tiger Taboo</p>
<p>Therefore, everyone at the time was talking about it, saying that Biyun's failure was due to the three white tigers. In fact, this is all superstition. In recent years, Liang Huating took over Zhonghe and signed a long-term contract with Yanqiu. As long as he performs in Beiping, Zhonghe will enjoy the patent. Yanqiu returned to China from France, and his reputation soared. Coincidentally, Lanfang lived far away at sea, so the Dan performance in Beiping seemed to be led by him. The seat price was sold to 1.7 yuan, and the business was booming, which invisibly benefited Liang Huating greatly. Yanqiu, since returning from overseas, has a fresh mind and certainly does not shy away from any white tigers or black tigers. However, Liang's adventurous attempt shows that he is also very courageous. Now it is said that he has made a profit of more than 100,000 yuan, and he is a well-off family. On the other hand, Xu Lao Si has become destitute. In recent years, apart from being able to gain a foothold in Guanwai, the people of Ping City have simply forgotten his name. Xu Lao Si is not as good as Cheng Lao Si after all. The success or failure of a career depends entirely on whether the individual is progressive, and this has nothing to do with the White Tiger Terrace.</p>
<p>The Long Headgear Used by Dan Roles Was Created by Mei Qiaoling</p>
<p>Lanfang's grandfather, Mei Qiaoling, was a Dan actor and master of ceremonies at the same time as Boss Cheng (Changgeng). He was humble in his dealings with people and had superb skills. At that time, famous Dan actors such as Shi Xiaofu and Yu Ziyun were all his students. Mei was particularly fond of participating in charitable undertakings in his life, and his accumulated virtue may be unmatched in the Liyuan world, both ancient and modern. Last year, I briefly described a glimpse of his life's affairs in an article titled "Dr. Mei Does Not Know His Father's Name." At the time, some people criticized me for not playing this joke on the doctor. In fact, they did not understand the meaning of the article. Although the title was a bit peculiar, the article always praised Mei's three generations for their kindness in dealing with people, and repeatedly explained that Lanfang did not know his father's name because his father died too early and he was raised by his uncle since childhood. Moreover, I have known Wanhua for more than ten years and have never had any grievances, so how could I have malicious intentions? If all the articles I write every day are in a solemn tone, that would be a bit boring, so sometimes I use a humorous tone to make adjustments, which is also a last resort. (60)</p>
<h3>Chess Garden</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Bao Zibo, Revised by Lu Chengchou</p>
<p>Opening Method, 53rd Game</p>
<p>Black First</p>
<p>Central Cannon vs. Screen Horse, Continuation of the Previous Game</p>
<p>Pawn 7 Advances 1, Change, Cannon 8 Moves to 5, Pawn 3 Advances 1, Chariot 9 Moves to 8</p>
<p>Explanation: The Central Cannon is intended to attack the central route. Cannon 8 Advances 3 is intended to take the central pawn, open the way. Pawn 3 Advances 1 is a change of tactics by Red. If Black advances Pawn 7 to remove the pawn, then Red can advance Pawn 5 over the river, which can restrain the horse route of the cannon side.</p>
<p>Cannon 8 Moves to 5 is the correct move. Pawn 3 Advances 1 captures the horse. Although Red now has a pawn crossing the river, it is actually not very dangerous. Chariot 9 Moves to 8 captures the cannon with the initiative.</p>
<p>According to this month's opening method, we will focus on the various changes of Horse 3 Advances 4 and Cannon 8 Advances 3. Horse 3 Advances 4 is an old-school move and seems to be inappropriate. The new method mostly uses Cannon 2 Advances 1 to protect the pawn, so that the cannon side cannot use Chariot 2 Moves to 3 to take the initiative to suppress the horse. This is the Screen Horse method.</p>
<h3>A New Type of Dance Hall Will Appear Near the Metropolis — Vienna</h3>
<p>— Xingzhe</p>
<p>Near the west end of the Metropolis on Jing'an Temple Road, at the intersection of Seymour Road, inside a seven-story building, a new type of dance hall is being designed and built by the famous Hongda Foreign Firm, named "Xilimen Dance Hall."</p>
<p>Hongda Foreign Firm is a famous architect in Shanghai. Many of the major theaters and many famous tall buildings in Shanghai were designed by Hongda Foreign Firm. For example, the newly completed "Ping An" and "Du Mei" theaters are also newly designed buildings of the firm.</p>
<p>The entire decoration of the "Xilimen Dance Hall" is luxurious and magnificent. The entire venue uses spring seats, which are extremely comfortable. It is now being built day and night and will be opened soon. In the future, the "Metropolis," "Vienna," and "Xilimen," the three major dance venues on Jing'an Temple Road, will be like the "Wing On," "Sincere," and "Sun Sun" on Nanjing Road, standing tall and facing each other from afar.</p>
<p>Rerelease of "Farmer's Song": The new comedy film "Farmer's Song," which depicts the collective farm life of the Soviet Union, was screened at the Huguang Theater last month and was very popular among the general audience. Several new songs in it, such as "Farmer's Song" and "Fire Train March," are exciting and majestic and are even more popular among people who love singing. It is now heard that these songs have become popular in the city. It is heard that Asia Film Company and Du Mei Theater have reached an agreement to rerun it for a few days starting from the 16th of this month.</p>
