<h3>地中海的現勢</h3>
<p>英首相張伯倫與法總理達拉第雖經聯合發表宣言，決以武力保障希臘與羅馬尼亞的獨立，可是義大利却並未有所顧忌，又在計劃分割希臘·羅馬尼亞和保加利亞的領土。企圖建立馬其頓政權，更進一步就是奪取英法在地中海的利益。</p>
<p>地中海是給歐亞菲三洲包圍着的內海，是英國與印度·東菲·澳洲·遠東各殖民地間的交通耍道。為保障這要道的安全計，英國除在馬爾太島築有巨大的軍港，駐有强力的艦隊以外，還握着地中海的東西門戶，即直布羅陀海峽和蘇彝士運河出口處塞特港的支配權。所以直布羅陀·馬爾太和塞特港這三處便成為英國在地中海的軍事據點。不但如此，她在地中海的東部，也佔着絕對的優勢：希臘在政治上素和她接近，土耳其南面的塞浦洛斯島又是她的殖民地；推而遠之，她的勢力，更可以東經巴勒斯坦，伸入近東各地，如伊拉克·波斯·和紅海上的阿拉伯等；近年以來，她為增强這一方面的勢力，已在塞浦洛斯，塞特港和尼羅河口的亞歷山大利亞等地從事建築强有力的海空軍根據地。</p>
<p>法國也是地中海上的重要國家。地中海西部是她本國和北菲殖民地的唯一交通要道。吐龍，科西加，貝在太都是她的軍事根據地，她在那裏的經營，也曾下過不少的努力的。</p>
<p>義大利全國伸出地中海，地形正像一隻「靴子」。她在地中海中部，有着星羅棋佈的軍事根據地。歐戰以後，她盡力擴張其在亞德利亞海的勢力，以增强向地中海東部和西部發展的根據。她對阿比西尼亞的戰爭就是從事擴張在地中海勢力的開始。她併吞了阿比西尼亞之後，又在位於西西里與法屬突尼斯間的班脫里拉島上積極設防，察其目的，無非欲以此為潛艇和飛機的根據地，以便於必要時截斷地中海的交通。同時又在利比亞加强軍事佈置，完成杜布魯克軍港。這樣一來，往東北，可和多特堪尼斯羣島聯絡，往西又可鞏固西西里和班脫里拉間的聯繫，無形中控制了地中海中部和馬爾太島到蘇彝士運河的航路，於是法國本部和北菲殖民地的交通及英國在東地中海的勢力不得不感受她的威脅了。不但如此，她還勾結德國，發動西班牙內戰，於弗朗哥取得勝利之後，更和他締結軍事同盟，規定由德義出資，在比利尼斯山脈地帶，闢出八十方公里的土地，設立海軍空軍根據地，供德義使用；到了最近，又兼併阿爾巴尼亞，獨覇亞德利亞海，進而覬覦希臘的各府島，她的勢力是在急速地向地中海東部發展。</p>
<p>義大利勢力的迅速膨脹，老實說是英國的妥協政策所造成的。因為英國過去不贊成集體安全制度，而想用妥協的方式求得地中海利益的保障。可是妥協的結果，不但不能制止侵略，反使侵略者的行動，更為急進。到現在，連她自己在地中海的利益也受到重大的威脅了。　經過多次的打擊，英國現已漸漸覺悟了。這只看她和法國的共同表示：決以武力保障希臘和羅馬尼亞的獨立，維護她們在地中海的利益，也可證明。但在道高一尺，魔高一丈的情勢之下，僅賴外交的宣言非有實際的行動，是仍不足以制止侵略者的侵略的。現在，義大利又在憧憬着古羅馬帝國的光榮，企圖建立以地中海為湖沼的馬其頓政權；而在地中海西部又有希特勒遙為呼應，憑藉他同弗朗哥締結的軍事同盟所賦予的權利，將把一部份艦隊開入西班牙領海，以威脅直布羅陀了。我們且看英法二國又將怎樣維護她們在地中海的利益！</p>

<p>（倫敦）羅馬及柏林方面對於英相張柏倫今日在下院所發言論這第一以響、似為義德兩國仍堅定不移、且無悔意、羅京接獲英國担保援助羅馬尼亞之消息後、人民驚喜交集、官方皆表欣慰、各方面皆聞「勇敢」之驚歏聲浪、匈京方面之意見、則認英相之言論、對於國際時局之嚴重性、旣不能使之減少、亦不能使之增加、蓋覺局勢仍頗嚴重、一切皆有待於義德兩國此後之行動也、德國官場則在審慎研討英相言論詳細全文之前、不發表批評、惟由外國新聞發表官方授意之宣言、對於英相方辭中之多點、加以譴責、並嚴厲抨擊英國之宣傳方法、義國政界根據所接英相言論之簡略報告、發表意見、謂英相之言、予以正當之解釋、已承認義國之佔領阿爾巴尼亞、並不違反英議協定、對於地中海之現局、亦作同樣這觀察、對於英國實行其對羅馬尼亞及希臘担何之能力、則表示懷疑、對於英國向波蘭担保之情形亦然、並認義大利對希臘之担保、已使英國之向該國担保為多此一舉、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英法兩國同時以保障給予希臘羅馬尼亞兩國之後，此間外交界人士頃宣稱、此項片面的保障、　有改為互助協定之可能、但在目前此層並不重要、英法希羅四國、已因此而互相團結、各關係國間現所進行之談判乃可集中於土耳其一國、而將孩國與羅馬尼亞國所訂之互助協定、推行於巴爾幹半島其他各國、實際上言之、英法兩國所給予羅馬尼亞國之保障、當以英法兩國軍艦能否自由通過土國達達尼爾與博斯破魯斯爾海峽為斷、此即英法兩國亟欲與土國成立協定之故也、至以保加利亞國而論、該國對於羅馬尼亞國杜勃魯約省、抱有願望、未能達到、（按該省原屬保國所有）、因而不無耿耿、英國政府雖無法壓迫羅國、令其與保國成立協定、但土耳其國旣與各該國保有睦誼、自望其居中斟旋、此外、巴爾幹半島某某國對於蘇聯、仍有戒心、英國政府現擬勸告各該國與蘇聯訂立天空協定、不必成立一般的互助協定、藉以避去蘇聯陸軍或有假道各該國之事云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）張伯倫首相昨所發表之宣言、各報雖一致加以好評、但保守黨各報仍嫌政府行動濡緩、亦不充分、左派各報則謂、張伯倫首相之於蘇聯、僅在答復反對派各黨皆議時、約略涉及云、各報對於法國內閣總理達拉第所作宣言、亦表歡迎、並謂英國政府向羅馬尼亞國提供保障、乃由法國所堅持、故遲至最後一雯那、纔作此決定、工黨每日民聲報載稱「政府正在考慮各種緊急措置、一俟此種措置見諸實際之後、即須召集各關係國、併蘇聯在內、舉行會議、愛好和平各國、協力組織之真正的防禦陣綫、將及時實現」云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）英法兩國首揆昨所發表之宣言、此間政界人士皆表滿意、並謂兩大民治國政府領袖、態度堅決若此、是可佐證、慕尼黑協定所象徵之讓步時期、確已結束、而「真正的和平」遂有奠定之望、美國政府當局亦乘此機會、力言美國與英法兩國、均以遏制侵略為已任、可見彼此理想、實屬一致、各報亦加好評、僉謂英法兩國、業已決定重行組織集體安全制、民主黨紐約泰晤士報載稱、「英法兩國誠能與蘇聯締盟、以援助各小國、則新的集體安全制、必為之加強、返顧美國國會、尤應迅即修正中立法、俾克援助歐洲各民治國、共和黨紐約民聲稱壇報、則以各獨裁者缺乏誠鷾　言、略謂「義大利國所提供之諾言、毫無價值、此與其夥伴國社主義者所提供之諾言、初無二致、瞻念前途、歐洲奠定和平、當屬遙遙無期、至於目前能否茍安、亦視德義軸心能否暫停活動為轉移」云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）英法兩國以保障給予羅馬尼亞國一事、此間外交界人士咸皆加以重視、並謂、羅國政府深恐與英法兩國成立互助協定之後、德國即援為口實、而的有行動、英法兩國爰乃於該國外長茄芬哥前往柏林之前、給以片面的保障、藉以增強立場、此其為事、有足為者云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）關於英首相張柏倫昨日下午在下院宣佈英國已向羅馬尼亞·希臘提供單方援助保證一節、此間政界人士認為英國係繼續推行包圍德國之政策、德國政界人士指陳、德國與羅馬尼亞旣有經濟協定於先、而義大利與希臘又互相換文於後、是則英國保證之動機、并非出於愛好和平、而係基於英國之軍事利益也、蓋英國在黑海及愛琴海中、尋求海軍根據地、已非一日、倘一旦發生戰事、則希臘將與英國締結協定、將以上海軍地供給使用、此乃協約國強迫希臘加入世界大戰之故技、一九一五年英法兩國軍隊在薩隆尼卡登陸後、希臘仍拒絕參戰、於是協約國宣佈封鎖佔領雅典·皮爾各港、國王君士坦丁被迫遜位、希臘軍隊解除武裝、然後希臘乃充參加協約國作戰、由此觀之、希臘此次之接受保證、殆亦認為援助保證究愈於強迫須從、從而避免第二次之英國、「侵略」乎、（十四日海通電）</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞京城　英法兩國首揆發表宣言、以保障給予羅馬尼亞希臘兩國事、極為此間各報所重視、世界報戰稱「時至此日、英法兩國業已接受軍事的約束、從而樹立集體安全制、以反抗侵略政策、此舉純係防禦性質、絕無挑　或侵略意味存在乎其間、吾國所推行之政策、旣在維護本國領土完整與主權獨立、則對於英法兩國此種片面的保障、實無理由加以拒絕、時報載稱、「英法兩國首揆自動以保障給予吾國、乃係友一當可因此項保障之增加、而愈益加強」云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華沙　法國內閣總理達拉第昨日發表演說、主經加強法波兩國同盟條約之後、此間各報一至加以好評、咸謂歐洲均勢旣可因而恢復、和平希望亦因而增加、華沙日報載稱、「西歐各國維持和平之可能性、雖未完全喪失、但已決定在必要時而作戰、此於英法兩國在國防上所作凖備、可以見之、西歐各國所推行之外交政策、定可獲有重大成就、質言之、大規模的協商制度成立之後、侵略者逍遙法外之事、定可不復重見於今日」、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英對反侵略陣綫　力謀蘇俄加入　擬向土耳其提出保障　並使波蘭亦保障羅國</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據路透社訪員聲稱、一般人事前雖預料英　法立卽向希臘擔保抵抗侵略、但以為此時未必卽予羅馬　尼亞以同樣擔保、今悉英首相張伯倫及法總理達拉第在　過去二十四小時內、作長時間之討論後、始有對於羅國　亦予擔保之決定、尚有須注意者、卽英法對希羅兩國之　擔保、係片面之行動、英國現料波蘭有加入對羅擔保之　可能性、刻正與華沙方面進行討論、同時英國更與土耳　其進行親善坦白之討論、俟談判完畢時、英國當再發表　言論、表示在土國被攻擊時英國對土之態度、　至於保　加利亞方面、雖有種種困難、但終亦有加入列强集團之　可能性、凡加入之國、如有受德國或議國之攻擊者、其　餘各國均將予以援助、聞蘇聯如何參加擔保組織問題、　今正受其密切之注意、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>英外相發言定言</h3>
<p>（倫敦）外相哈立法克斯勳爵今日在上院發言、措辭與首相張柏倫在下院發表者相同、據稱、希臘及羅馬尼亞之獨立、如遭危脅、而認為必須抵抗侵時、英國將出全力以援助之、英政府已將此項宣言、通知直接有關及其他各政府、尤其為土耳其、因土希兩國關係之密切、固為世人所熟知也、渠悉法國亦已發表同樣宣言、哈氏述及撤退西班牙境內之義國軍隊時、謂義外相齊亞諸曾於四月九日告英國駐義大使裴資爵士、西境之義軍撤退時、義方飛機及駕駛人員亦均將離去云、代表工黨之斯尼爾勳爵及代表自由黨之洛齊安勳爵、乃相繼發言、促請英國與蘇聞同盟、謂此事實有絕對之重要、哈氏於答覆辯論提及蘇聯之時、曾鄭重聲言、英政府必須應付各種非彼等造成之真正困難、並稱、渠在此憂患之數星期中、曾竭力以政府之意見、告知蘇聯大使邁斯基、並對於其他方面之信任、加以相當之注意、凡此種種困難、或亦為其他各國所感覺云、哈氏又向上院担保、政府之思想、除決心以最大之努力聯合一切或能尊重國際關係及與吾人有關須加保障之各事者外、別無他意、政府僅其權力之所及、以消除各種困難云、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>英反對派表示失望</h3>
<p>（倫敦）張伯倫首相本日午後在下議院發表宣言之後、反對派工黨領袖阿德里少校、繼之發言、表示失望之意、略謂「義相墨索里尼在英義協定中所接受之義務、業已故意予以違反、英國政策自不應再　以此項協定為依歸、吾人所靳求者、乃推行真正的保障政策、不以一星期半個月為對象、而當樹立持久的集本安全制、首相對於蘇聯立場如何、並無雙字道及之殊為憾事、抑知吾人茍欲樹立集體安全制度、必須以英法蘇聯三國為軸心、從而促使愛好和平各種勢力、環繞此軸心、團結一致、要之、政付倘不願以堅決手段、較易着手也」反對派自由黨領袖辛克萊繼之發表演說、亦謂、英法蘇聯三國樹立密切的堅決的合作關係、實乃必要之舉、但首相竟　無隻字涉及蘇聯、寗非憾事、為今之計、吾國務當改組內閣、「前任外相艾登與前任財相邱吉爾、富於犧牲精神、並又能信守健全的而又不為他人所　喜的原則、倘能出任首相財相、則英國人民在此黑暗時代、定可獲有極大之鼓勵、此外內閣並無　添設軍需部緣吾人為歐洲各國保障安全之後、一旦遇有戰事、倘在軍艦之外、不能以飛機彈　藥軍隊繼之、則保障云者、實亦徒託空言而已」、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）下議院昨日午後開會時、反對派工黨議員達爾頓、表演說、力謂關於集體安全組織、英國務當邀請蘇聯參加或贊助、但未審政付已否向蘇聯政府提出建議、願聞其詳、西門財相當即答稱、政府於推行新政策之初、即已邀請蘇聯加以贊助、即政府與各關係國進行談判時、亦始終與蘇聯政府保持最密切之聯絡、蓋吾人何自而可獲援助、其事原甚明顯、吾人若並此而不能理會、寗非愚拙已極、一言以蔽之、吾人絕無排斥蘇聯之意、蘇聯對於維護和平所可作之貢獻、吾人亦充分認識之」是以任何建議、凡主張與該國成立軍事同盟條約者、政府並不反對云、此間政界人士對於財相此言、極端重視、咸謂西門財相發言之前、外務部欠官賈德幹爵士曾與之密切聯絡、故財相措詞極為切實、同使西茲爵士、曾於今晨訪晤蘇聯外交　人民委員長李維諾夫、說明英國意志、並詢問蘇聞真意云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日軍犯江門中　華軍突起三路反攻　日軍犯粵以來最近受創最重　曾派艦艇圖在台山登陸未逞</h3>
<p>香港通信、廣州日軍、近來雖迭有增援、但甫乘運艦南來、旋又分發各地、最近分兵兩聯隊由水陸路犯新會鶴山、取道陸路者、多數由佛山九江順德各處推進、犯江門一綫、則多由黃埔乘船開猪頭山集中、然後由北街登岸、進窺寗陽鐵路、連日新會城附近戰事仍烈江門經數度拉鋸戰、蓋江門北街無險可守、華軍縱攻入江門、但在戰略上、不能不再放棄、須俟日軍由海道增援中斷、方克將江門新會城完全收復、故目下新會戰事、視乎廣州東西北江軍情之轉移而定、華軍刻取圍魏救趙計劃、乘日軍窺新會及寗陽鐵路之際、在東北西三江突起反攻、數日來進展頗速、計東路華軍自三日起、由屛風嶺·寨頂·葫蘆嶺·進攻增城、連克荔枝坳·龍虎坳、增城日軍、已被包圍、北江華軍、於六日黎明國攻粵漢路南段新街站、該站有日軍强固工事、事先被華軍飛機炸燬、繼由步隊衝鋒、將新街至花縣間各據點奪回、日軍傷亡甚衆、華軍節節進迫、六日晚、一度衝至江村、江村距廣州西北郊不過數十里、廣州市民隱約聞砲聲、廣州市內日軍、匆遽抽調援應、並密集砲火向江村猛轟、一面由花縣方面日軍、抄出花縣東北、華軍為戰略計、是夜暫退出江村、以全力攻花縣東北之日軍、日軍卒敗退龍口莊、又花縣以南之石角圩及楊村各地、均為華軍克復、至西江方面華軍、於五日晚同時出擊、日軍倉皇應戰、至六日卒不支、馬口·溶口·楊梅　及舊三水縣治地、相繼被華軍收復、位於西北江樞紐之南海縣屬三江官窰、平日有日軍六七百、是晚、亦為華軍殲滅過半、日軍自入粵以來、以上述數役、受創最重、</p>
<p>連日犯新會之日軍、不但無進展、且受東西北三江日軍失敗之影響、多無心戀戰、日前在江門新會搜掠所得之五金屬製品、紛粉用艦搬運而去、五金原料之外、尙有被擊斃之日軍屍體五六百具、統由北街用船運至焚屍地區火化、江門自經戰事後、商店多被炸燬、仍存者或被刧或停業、江門內河、為五邑出入必經之水道、刻以軍事關係、取道江門至鶴山或由新會至台山開平之陸路、悉已破壊、新會難民、現均逃至江門西南之禮樂圩、復由禮樂轉中山縣境　然後由中山遵陸赴澳門、若由澳門赴四邑、不經江門、現祇有循水道赴新曾之三江瀧水口、然後遵陸往台山屬之公益埠、日軍以台山沿海岸綫甚長、且上下川島附近、巨艦可以灣泊、近又擬在廣海登陸、牽制四邑援江華軍、連日台山赤溪兩縣交界海面、忽停泊日艦二十餘艘、橡皮船十餘艘、汽艇六七艘、艦上日陸戰隊的五六百名、於月之五日晚會派兵百餘、乘汽艇及裝甲漁船駛至廣海岸邊、企圖偷渡、同時日艦發砲向岸上亂轟、至六日下午四時許、第二次進犯、日兵數百、藉艦上砲火掩護、向廣海沙堤岸邊闖至、初時地方國隊嚴密警戒、俟日兵迫近岸上、始密集砲火掃射、相持約一小時、日兵知華方有備、始乘艇退走、刻當地防軍、已將沿海公路破壊、防日軍登陸抄擊四邑、（四月八日）</p>
<h3>武漢淪陷後情形（續）　武漢之歸客談</h3>
<p>日兵荒淫厭戰</p>
<p>敵人　在漢口　辦了許多妓院、慰勞皇軍、每天每一個妓女要和四十多個日兵發生關係、日本士兵每天排隊到妓院去、並且每人執一個木牌、這妓女再將木牌集起到日本軍營領款、此外每日强姦槍殺的事件層出不窮、</p>
<p>漢口的飛機塲比從前擴大兩三倍了、經常地停者敵機、他們的軍火、多半放在沿江岸、但時常搬動、據挑夫們談說、子彈箱子非常輕鬆、油箱也是一樣、不知是何道理、</p>
<p>沈家廟·漢正街·一帶、是劃為難民區的、難民區的糧食、是經常的接濟不上、武昌的難民區、是文華大學、有一决難民斷糧了、華中大學的孟主敎到難民區發米、對難民們說、」這米不是我們發的、是你們的委員長在退出武漢時給你們留下的、囑咐我現在發給你們、你們永遠不要忘了你們的委員長」難胞們聽了都感動非常、</p>
<p>從許多地方、我們可以看出敵軍反戰的情形、有一次、難民區中的日本憲兵對幾個難胞說、「要死的話、你們在我們前十分鐘死、現在你們是被三個圈子包圍着、」他說着、並川手畫着三個圈子、第一個圈子內表示是難民、第二個圈子表示是日軍、外面的大圈子表示我軍的包圍、他說着並用手在第二個圈上擦去一個缺口說、「我們將來就死在這裏」、此外、日本士兵常問難胞們說、「你們有妻子沒有、有兒女沒有、有父母沒有、」他們將他們妻子的照片拿出來給大家看、他們都知道他們被開到華中來作戰、是沒有回去的希望了、</p>
<p>漢奸醜類現形</p>
<p>使我們　悲憤的是、在廢曆的　元旦、一個小孩子為了在街頭唱「義勇軍進行曲」·被日軍慘殺了、再一次、在維持會成立的一天、日軍在街面發五色旗太陽旗慶祝、一羣小孩因激於愛國憤慨、將紙旗折斷了、被日軍發覺後、也遭到殘酷的殺戮、</p>
<p>日軍侵入武漢的一星期後、就出版了一個「武漢報」、便是敵人的宣傳報紙、還有一個不定期的報紙時常在市面發現、名呌「勵報」、裏面的內容、却是針對着武漢報的、勵報的出版地方、是沒有人知道的、還有使我們興奮的事、一些販報的小孩子們、他們在遇見日本士兵的時侯、口裹就呌賣、「武漢報、武漢報、」等到一進了租界門口、就跳起來喊、「中央軍包圍了武漢的報、游擊隊打進武漢的…報」、我們從這裹知道了淪陷區的難胞們、是何等的在期待着我們打回去、幾次我們的飛機轟炸武昌南湖飛機塲、徐家柵、珞珈山時、同胞們說、「只要看見我們的飛機來轟炸、炸死了也是願意的、」從這裏我們看出來我們中華民族的子孫是永遠不會向敵屈服的、</p>
<p>武漢現在的漢奸團體、維持會的負責人、多半是從前武漢商界活動的人、游戲塲的經理是維持會長、像楊輝庭·李鼎安·金龍章·等都是維持會重要的負責人物、還有一個「留日同學會」、也是最有力的漢奸機關、其中値得我們注意的、就是過去在武漢做救亡工作的人、如今竟有的做了漢奸、這是値得以後我們最要留心的地方　（完）</p>

<h3>英商會主席抨擊　日壓迫外商手段　馬歇爾列舉經過之事實證明日歧視第三國人民</h3>
<p>大陸報云、上海英商會主席馬歇爾爵士、昨（十三日）晚在該會年會席間致詞、猛烈詆責日本對侵佔區內外商所施之壓迫手段、謂「軍事需要」或顧念外國航運之福利、現均不能承認爲封鎖揚子江、不准外國商輪航行之有效理由、馬氏所作其他顯著覜察點、爲（一）日本因軍事行動而頒行條例、如在靑島與揚子江所施者、實爲歧視第三國人民、（二）雖曾提出抗議、但至今日方似未明瞭其對第三國人民之義務、（三）與揚子江口各口岸之貿易、已循常規進行、但日方近以商業上所罕用之手段、剝奪英輪之貿易、（四）日本一面聲稱切望復興其侵略區、一面復拒不將私營工廠、歸還合法原主、（五）「華北海關許可」條例、確屬岐視與關閉開放之門戶、華北之貿易、實際已吿停頓、</p>
<p>日歧視第三國人民　馬氏致詞、首說明去歲商會之工作、大半關於因中日戰爭而起之問題、繼稱、去歲如前綫不斷有戰事、日軍已侵佔華北·華中·華南·最重要港口、與商業市塲、致使國民政府日前不能運用大部份海關收入、日方因軍事行動而頒行之條例、實歧視第三國人民、據關於華中發展公司等之簡單電訊判斷之、日方之謀獨佔、乃已成事實、</p>
<p>北區東區開放無期　自上海區發生戰事、迄今將十六閱月、而對於華人入北區與東區、仍加限制、致彼等不能在該兩區內重興其工業、得有工部局特權之英商電車與公共汽車兩公司、亦不能在該兩區營業、但日方之公共汽車公司未獲有任何合法權者、則在蘇州河北岸行駛、</p>
<p>獨佔長江暢銷日貨　上海之貿易端賴自由得達內地、揚子江流域、四川與華北各口岸、如有任何阻礙、即受致命打擊、戰爭天然使貿易途徑受有阻碍、但「軍事需要與顧念外國航運之福利、現均不能認爲完全封鎖揚子江、不准外國商輪航行之有效理由、已往若干時、日本商輪載運商品、來往揚子江各口岸、日方運輸公司在華字報紙刋登運貨往內地之廣吿、日方或中日合設之運輸行、亦在揚子江各口岸紛紛開設、此在英商與英國航運、乃非常重要之事、英國之貿易與航行暫趨停頓、而日方則暫時獨佔揚子江之貿易與航運、前已對此提出抗議、今後尙將爲之、但日方似未明瞭其對第三國人民之義務、目前尙無滿意解决之望、</p>
<p>內河航運全部覇佔　揚子江口各口岸間之貿易、今已循常規進行、但日方近以商業所罕用之手段、使華籍船夫、不敢駛近英輪、而剝奪英輪之貿易日方獨佔內河航運、對英國貿易、亦有重要影響、蓋日方統制中國一切內河航行、乃施用岐視手段、當然直接違反英國所享之條約上權利、</p>
<p>非法沒收華人工廠　一九三八年主要特點之一、厥爲西區之設立大批工廠、表示中國實業之勇敢與決心、彼等在楊樹浦與其他工業中心地之工廠、雖已損失、但不加遲疑、即在彼等感覺可不受干涉之區內、重新創業、雖多數均屬小規模者、但均進行順利、必將擴展而某礎穩固、東區中華商重要工廠、多已毀壊或被竊、若已開工、則非原主管理、前爲重要工業中心地之無錫與常州區、聞未毀之機件、多被日軍運走、日方一面聲稱、切望促其侵略區之復興、一面則除非以由日人合作管理、分取所獲利益爲條件、則拒絕將私營工廠歸還合法主人、日方雖否認沒收私營工廠或有沒收之意、但事實俱在、無論沒收與否、山人來得華人原主許可、已强佔許多工廠而開工經營矣、</p>
<p>碼頭貨物多吿失蹤　貯存日本碼頭與招商局碼頭之貨物、因戰事未能運出、今大部份雖已交還合法貨主、但亦有失蹤者、自戰事開始起、兩碼頭即在日陸海軍當局之掌握中、則貨物失蹤、顯由日常局負直接責任、</p>
<p>國民政府償付外債　一九三八年五月、英日政府訂立條約、規定被佔各港口之海關收入、應以海關總監督名義、存入橫濱正金銀行、償付外債之一部份、於需要時即應交出、並規定交出國民政府應付予日木之款項、因國民政府未加入該約、且未加核准、故海關收入、雖已存入橫濱正金銀行就償付外債而言、該約迄未履行、但國民政府仍償付一切外債、至一九三八年十二月三十一日爲止、始宣佈自一九三九年一月一日起、不復全部償付外債、而以得自仍在國府管理下口岸之收入中償付若干成之償債金、存入中央銀行、</p>
<p>重要鐵道擅加經營　日軍前侵結果、中國重要鐵道、均爲日方所佔、而刻正經營之、日方不顧此等鐵道大半抵於外國債券持有人、而拒絕債券持有人之代表調査其產業之情况、或管理其一部份、日方今已經營此等鐵道、盡取其收入、致債券持有人暫時被剝奪其合法權利、</p>
<p>發行紙幣統制外滙　一九三八年二月十一日、日方主持之「聯合準備銀行」在華北成立、同年三月十日、發行準備金不足之紙幣、本年三月十一日、華北「臨時政府」頒佈條例、意在强迫華北使用不能自由易取外匯之「聯銀」紙幣、以逐出確具外滙價値之法幣、爲便利償其志願起見、海關禁止某數種華北主要出口貨物輸出、須以外滙經橫濱正金銀行以一先令二便士之滙率易成「聯銀」紙幣、始得出口、此項規則、自動的在華北樹立有利於日本各銀行之金融壟斷、出口商雖先受其影響、但不久除日人以外之外貨入口商亦將受其影響、蓋自輸出物品所獲得之外櫃能否用以作輸入物品之資本、毫無保證也、是項條例、確屬歧視、有遠門戶開放之原則、其直接之影響、已使華北貿易實際已吿停頓、</p>
<p>一切政策顯屬排外　自去年接得華北華中之消息、與本埠所遭之經歷、以及華中發展公司之消息察之、顯見日本乃採取一種有利於日本與日本人民之政策、日方聲稱外人不瞭解其意向但如此等意向保持睦誼者、則所稱他人方面不瞭解、實無理由云、馬氏末乃對英商會去年間之工作、作簡略之檢討、繼由商會名譽副會長喬治與駐滬英國商務參贊、相繼致詞、</p>

<p>臨時扣用　裝兵、所有乘客、均被驅逐上岸、至晚六時、尙未見該輪駛回、故日兵運往何處未明、惟衆信係應付上南一帶游擊隊、始有此項緊急措置、又悉浦東塘口鎭、向爲忠義救國軍范根才部佔領、現因僞南匯「自衛團」</p>

<p>葡商航務全部停頓　現代社記者昨向航業界探悉、葡商在本市經營航務者、計有正德輪船公司·美利輪船公司·華美航業公司·康生輪船公司·大西洋航業公司·郭斯德洋行·六洲公司·等九家、共輪隻二十餘艘、分駛滬浙·滬閩·新港·北沙·等綫、自本月五日起、發生日艦扣留大批葡輪事後、因問題嚴重、所有未被扣之鋪輪、為避免意外、在該案未解決前、一律暫緩開航、致葡商在滬之全部航務、業已陷於完全停頓狀態、各輪公司之損失、雖明確佔計、但為數至為鉅大、</p>
<p>葡商代表謁總領事　本市全體葡商、以各輪被扣、迄未獲釋、航商業務、已陷全部停頓、且各輪所縣葡國國旗、竟亦被日方強迫卸下、事關國體、尤認為莫大這恥辱、故曾經數度集議應付辦法、當經推出代表、向葡總領事請求、昨晨正德公司大班派利拉氏、又謁鋪總領事、要來迅將詳情電告駐華公使館、向日方提出交涉、同時電請葡國駐日大使、向東京政府提嚴重抗議、俾該案得以早日解決、又悉葡總領愛爾夫斯近經本國政府任命調任為駐紐約總領事、原定本月十三日起程覆新、茲以葡輪被扣案未獲解決、故已延緩離滬、以便專力辦理</p>

<h3>奉賢富紳陳泊菴故後　昆仲爭執遺產　側室李氏侵佔財產髮妻及子提起刑訴</h3>
<p>奉賢陳泊菴、爲該邑有名紳商、富厚亦推爲全縣冠、故鄕不動產之外、滬埠各大銀行內、彼之存款尤鉅、更設有典常於租界區域、陳有兩婦、一爲馬文蘊、生子女君荄·君蕙·君莛·君萼·君蘧·五人、俱已長成、分別服務於商學兩界、一爲李氏、亦生有君芙·君菼·兩子、現尙在求學年齡、前歲八一三</p>
<p>戰事發生　奉賢地處海濱、乃敵騎蹂躪之所、陳泊菴遂先與李氏挈領君芙·君菼·隨帶財產契據、及珍貴之物、避難來滬、稅居逆旅、其餘一部份家屬、則都離散、泊菴至滬未久、以年邁力衰、復不勝此流離顚沛之苦、病於旅邸、延至十月間、其馬氏所出之子君萼踵至、見老父</p>
<p>病勢垂危　恐一旦物化之後、則財產不易考核、當請於其父命將寓滬之親戚朱友淸邀往旅館、俾朱以公證資格、將所携箱篋內各項財產證據、詳開淸冊、以憑存查、迨當日君萼邀釗朱某時、泊菴已被李氏送入仁濟醫院、未幾病故、致朱不及就病榻辦理、遂由君萼將所有箱篋</p>

<h3>大都會舞廳　發生遷讓之訟　恒業公司限令遷讓舞廳當局據理駁斥</h3>
<p>戈登路靜安寺路口現大都會花園舞廳原址之土地、原爲美商普益地產公司所有之空地、在民國二十四年五月七日經大都會與普益公司訂的租賃該項空地、建築舞廳、當時訂明每月地租爲國幣七百兀、如將來有人擬出高價租賃該地時、普益公司應提出證明、通知大都會常局、大都會方面如欲繼續承租、則須加租至第三者所出價額之租金、該項契約爲不定期之契約、大都會方面、</p>
<p>自訂約之後　即在該空地上、蓋建房屋、佈設花園、所耗不下十萬金、及至民國二十七年五月、該項土地所有權、由普益地產公司移轉與英商恒業地產公司、而大都會之租賃契約、亦同時移轉、迄今並無糾紛、乃去年大都會股東間因意見不洽、有一部份股東退出、而由經理江耀章另</p>
<p>招新股加入　正此時間、恒業公司忽於去年十月間竟通知大都會方面、自二十八年一月一日起、租金每月須增加爲八百五十元、江耀章對於加租一點、並無異議、惟感覺租約之不定期爲不妥、故即委託英籍律師理克司氏、與恒業公司經理史密司、爲訂一定期三年之契約恒業方面當</p>
<p>提出數條件　爲大都會所應遵照者、恒業通知自二十八年一月一日起租金加至八百五十元、並須大都會組織爲英商有限公司、如先令市價有漲縮、以九便士爲標準、再定增减租金、此項條件、屢經磋商、大都會方面一一予以接受、正擬重訂契約、詛恒業公司忽於去年十二月二十八日、又以書面通知、謂依照前訂契約規定、雙方如</p>
<p>欲解除契約　得於三個月前通知、現敝公司根據契約、限於民國二十八年三月三十一日爲止、大都會必須將租地返還、並拆除地上建築物、回復原狀、大都會方面以恒業公司出爾反爾、顯屬另有作用、故除遵照恒業以前通知加租至八百五十元外、並對遷讓各點表示反對、恒業於逾三月三十一日期限之後、即延律師向特一法院對大都會提起追還租地、回復原狀之訴、同時並聲請</p>
<p>准予假執行　昨由特院倪徵噢推事開庭傳訊、大都會方面延陳霆銳·吳麟坤·律師到庭答辯、其理由略稱、本件原被兩造所訂之契約、雖表面似屬普通相約、然實際當時被吿所租者、僅）空地、而後在地上建築房屋、故實屬民法八百三十四條之地上權、依照地上權規定、須欠租達二年以上、方得解約、今被吿絕未拖欠分文地租、即戰事發生時、舞廳停業、改</p>
<p>作傷兵醫院　時、亦照付租金、而最近原吿通知加租、亦予照辦、且原吿於提出加租之後、被吿除允諾外、復與原吿商訂定期租約、而原吿所提出各種條件、被吿亦忍痛委曲接受、當時雙方往返函件達十餘通之多、乃原吿方面更登報破壊被吿之營業、顯屬另有作用、根據某小報之刋載、謂係退股之</p>
<p>一部份股東　圖挖該地之消息、證以原吿反覆無常之舉動、適足以證明原吿提出本訴、係受第三者之鼓動、總之、被吿旣未拖欠分文租金、更已照加租金、則絕未違背法律上及契約上之任何規定、而原吿所根據契約上三個月前通知一點、要知此條乃屬解約之手續、非屬一種解約之原因、如</p>
<p>若依此條件　爲一種解約之原因、則大都會甫於今日建就房屋、明日原吿即可通知於三個月後遷讓、豈非兒戲、是以應請庭上駁回原吿之訴、並令負担訟費、至假執行部份被吿旣未欠租、且有二千一百元之押租、故亦請一併予以駁回云云、並提出各種證據呈察、倪推事核辦後、即宣告辯論終結、定期宣吿判決、</p>

<p>教育消息</p>
<h3>敎育部召開　訓育討論會　陳敎部長發表訓育主張通過導師制切實推行案</h3>
<p>（重慶特訊）敎育部於三月三十一日至四月一日、召集川·黔·甘·陝·豫·等省敎廳廳長及全國各大學訓育主任舉行訓育討論會、討論日程、第一日上午八時至十二時訓話及訓育報吿、下午二至六時訓育報吿、第二日上午九時至十二時分組討論、下午二至六時全體大會、七時閉幕、第一日由陳部長立夫親自主席、並演講吾國之訓育、歷四小時、</p>
<p>陳氏演詞</p>
<p>陳氏演詞大致謂、吾國人民最大缺憾有二、一爲缺少組織、二爲缺乏熱忱、因無組織、各人自私自利、國家乃呈亂的現象、因無熱忱、各人死氣沉沉、國家乃呈煩悶狀態、欲救是弊、惟有「禮」「樂」、禮樂爲完成道德之敎育、禮樂不行、道德淪亡、賞罰不明矣、禮者、整齊嚴肅之謂上下層層節制、左右分工合作、先後步伐整齊、禮亦爲標準化、統一化、照此標準、學校訓育應嚴格實施、樂者、生動活潑之謂、七情之敎育、但不放任、仍有紀律、精神上受相當之調劑、禮的精神若父親、爸爸式之敎育、硬性的、決定大綱、含應該與不應該性質、樂的精神、若母親、媽媽式之敎育、軟性的、囉囉囌囌、含爲什麽應該如此與不應該如此、外國禮拜堂之敎育乃禮樂敎育也、無禮如無父、則爲孤子、無樂如無母、則爲哀子、吾國禮樂不行也久矣、遂爲孤哀子的民族、故對禮樂應從根救起、不然我人眞是孤臣賊子矣、</p>
<p>陳氏之訓育主張、則曰（一）一個中心信仰「誠」、（二）五個關係「君臣·父·子·兄弟」、（三）三個要點「智·仁·勇」、（四）六個辦法「禮·樂·書·數·射·御」、（五）八個步驟「格物·致知·誠意·正心·修身·齊家·治國·平天下」、旋對於誠·六藝·智仁勇·五倫等、又發揮不少意義、聽者莫不動容、繼陳氏致訓者爲顧次長毓琇、顧氏解釋智仁勇有獨到之見解、顧謂智爲創造、仁爲服務、勇爲犧牲、曾舉出不少科學家、因謀公衆福利而創造而犧牲　長途電話發明家餓死、其最著者也、</p>
<p>二氏講畢、有人起問校訓應否統一問題、陳部長謂、部已見命令各校、但現在蔣委員長意思、定忠孝仁愛信義和平爲「國訓」而以「禮義廉恥」爲「校訓」</p>
<p>分組會議</p>
<p>待各校各廳報吿訓育實施狀况及困難問題後、乃開小組討論會、計分二祖、一爲專科以上學校組、由吳俊升司長召集、參加討論者有敎都張鼎彝·周尙·鏡雲階及各校代表查良釗·袁敦禮·王書林·等、另一組爲中等學校組、由顧樹森司長召集、參加討論者爲部中鍾道贊·戴應觀·及廳校代表鄭通和·張志韓·王捷三·等、兩組討論提案相同、（一）推行導師制問題、（二）社會服務問題、（三）操行成績考査標準問題、（四）學生態度問題、</p>
<p>議决要案</p>
<p>大會議決要案如下、（一）導師制應如何切實推行案、一·造成與論、二·注意敎師工作支配、三·規定簡要表格、四·舉行付託儀式、中學導師制應與大學不同、男女分別、以級爲單位、每級二十五人以上者設組導師、分校應設分校導師、（二）略、（三）社會服務及勞動服務應如何實施案、一·確定服務範圍、如與抗戰·生產·敎育·衛生有關者、二·依照地方狀况及學校所在地而定、三·利用暑假寒假、四·需要監督等、（四）操行成績考査標準應如何規定案、一·由部定標準、二·確定批評方法、三·應以身體·品性·學問·服務等爲準、閉幕式、由陳部長致辭、歷一小時半、圓滿而散、</p>
<h3>第三屆全國敎育會議　議決案全文（八）　中學敎育改進案（下）　（申報特約記者毅生自重慶航寄）</h3>
<p>（七）充實中學科學儀器及圖書設備（見敎育用品類提案）</p>

<p>（八）積極推行抗戰期中之特別設施與訓練（本案作爲中等敎育、共同案）</p>
<p>一、戰區各省市敎育行政機關、應注意調查失學之靑年、設法繼續維持其課業、二、後方各省敎育行政機關、應注意調査、由戰區退出之失學失業靑年、設法予以短期之訓練、以便派往各地服務、三、敎育部訂定失學失業靑年之短期訓練辦法、分別山中央或各省切實施行、四、後方各省敎育廳應令飭各中等學校依照中等學校特種敎育綱要酌量减少授課時間、切實厲行精神訓練後方服務訓練及有關抗戰需要之各項特殊知識技能訓練、五、督促後方各省敎育廳、令飭各中等學校今後特別注重生產勞動之訓練、</p>

<h3>男子體健是婚後幸福的鐵證</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培　性病專科醫師詹念曾合著</p>
<p>（診所）北京路四川路口中國信託公司二樓</p>
<p>（時間）上午十時至下午六時星期日休息</p>
<p>處女的心，是光明的，純潔的，也是最美化的。有時在她曼妙的理想中，出現着如何美滿的家庭，如何伶俐的孩子，如何幸福的婚後生活……可是一待婚後，這些美麗的理想，每成爲輕煙似的夢幻，消失了，所賸餘的不過是虛空與悲哀而已！這種女性在今日社會上，恐怕要佔多數。</p>
<p>結婚，我們率直言之，是因爲感覺身心的寂寞而要求歡慰的。誠然，一個健美多情的女郞，一旦和精强力壯的男子結婚，因爲天賦的奧妙，旣歡慰了我，同時又歡慰了你，他們的愛情，必然無限的繾綣而甜蜜，生育着伶俐的子女，組織着快樂的家庭，他們的生命是新鮮的，豐富的；他們的前途是光明的，遠大的；因爲有愛情來鼓勵着，滋潤着，有健康的活力來發動着，推進着，這眞是多麽的光榮而幸福！婚後生活所以悲哀？我們在生理上的研究，大都因爲身心上有了缺陷所致。這種缺陷又大多以男子爲多。所以一個少女在選擇配偶之時，應實事求是，擺脫虛榮，什麽財產，地位，門第等等都非最主要的條件，所最主要者，爲身體健康。因身體健康實爲婚後幸福鐵的保證。</p>
<p>男子身心何以多缺陷？這大都因早年犯有自凟與遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾與憂勞斵傷之故，致性機能受其摧殘，爆發着滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，發育不全，精薄不育，神經衰弱等症，則在夫婦生活上即不能歡慰其妻，在事業前途又不能奮發有爲，因此，妻子怎能不感覺失望，而悲哀系之！由此而演出家庭間之種種悲劇者，亦是甚多的事！同時此種病症如遷延不治，更將形成未老先衰或竟危及生命！唯一補救辦法，據世界名醫及余經驗，均以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，最爲對症特效。因此劑係由雄壯動物如猩猩海狗等體中提取的生殖腺素用科學方法複製而成。所以品質貴重，效力偉大，服後於一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，若繼續服用，必可於短期內將上述各症完全治愈，幷可收延年益壽返老還童之效。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，制止遺洩，則標本兼治，收效尤速。</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯美的價值</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>審美觀念已不同，不尙容顏尙乳峯，倘因疾病雙乳癟：穠妝艷抹也虛空！</p>
<p>從前男子看女人，他們只看頭足，所謂『雲鬟霧鬟總相宜，步步金蓮勾心扉』，而現在的男子看女人，此種錯誤觀念已完全摒棄，他們兩隻閃電似的眼淸，祗向女人的胸前射去，如果看到這個女性的乳峯，在行動時，高聳着一起一伏，呈出十足誘人的驕姿。那麽即使面貌平庸，也會像發見了寳藏似的，欣賞珍視，嘖嘖稱羨，反之，如果她的乳峯，因自凟，束胸，或月經不調，自帶纏綿，病後虧弱，以致卯巢機能失健，影响新陳代謝作用，形成萎癟狀態者，則雖穠粧艷抹，或臉蛋兒長得很漂亮，我可以肯定說一句，男女間的愛情，也是很難持久的，因爲裝扮的究不敵健康美來得可貴。如是乳峯萎癘的，那便是丈夫不加厭惡，自已想想，總也覺得萬分羞媿吧！？</p>
<p>所以現在聰明的女性，對於乳峯，已是非常重視，如不幸而萎癟了，她們無不立即服卵巢製劑女用『生殖素」以爲挽救，蓋此劑藥性和平，功效偉大，無論各種婦女隱病，均能在短期內一一爲妳治愈，如果繼續服用，持之以恒，不但可使萎癟的乳峯，變得豐滿高聳，且能返老還少，使面頰紅潤，益增嬌艶。</p>
<h3>遺精靑年會毀滅前途</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>一個靑年人好像太陽剛出山一樣，應當有着他無限的前途和光明。在他生命之火中發生着燃燒似的熱力，但這種熱力必須要用在正大光明的路上去，若把這種熱力誤用，如靑年人因爲性的苦悶，犯有手淫，意淫，以及荒淫縱慾而致遺精，則主宰我人健康和壽命的體內生殖腺液，必有大量的流失，是以百病叢生，凡腦衰健忘，耳鳴限花，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，肢體疲憊等症即相繼而起。在性機能方面，更因性神經失其責司之故，凡滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，精薄不育，發育不全等症，亦接連而來，則在夫婦生活上，必不能爲妻滿足，愛情因以淡薄，或竟因此而演出家庭問之種種悲劇！靑年男子，身體旣弱，復受此磨折，更多未老先衰，早年殀殤，前途只有地獄與死滅而已！</p>
<p>欲謀補救，唯一辦法，即服「希米脫氏固精片」，則即可鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，使麥幻減少，夜得安眠，則遺精即可痊愈。如因遺精已引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，若繼續服用，必可於短期內根本治愈上述各症，幷可收延年益壽返老還童之效。但患者如能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療，注射，手術等各種療法，更可保證治　。</p>

<h3>淋病可以根治的方針</h3>
<p>要根治淋病，並非難事。在某種塲所，簡直較治流行性感冒還要容易。所謂在某種塲所者，即急性白濁是也。在急性淋病時，如能細心診斷，確定淋菌所在之部分，然後對症處治，無有不在五六天至多七八天內，絕對保證斷根。可是許多醫家，總是以爲淋病在急性時期，並不去區別某症狀，而老是用落伍之舊式療法，或服不對症之市上成藥，此種刻舟水劍之療法，將本來可以迅速治愈之急性淋，往往一誤再誤，减低病家原有之抵抗力，無異開門揖盜，逼毒入內，如是而要淋病之迅速斷根，實南轅而北轍，故凡爲初次罹染淋病者，切勿以自身健康與幸福，作爲兒戲而行不合理之療法，</p>
<p>要根治淋病——急性淋時，先當作愼密之診察，如尿道鏡檢査之，以洞悉其炎症是否已延及後尿道，又用膀胱鏡以洞悉其是否已成膀胱炎，又用超倍顯微鏡以檢査其淋菌之外，尙混有其他淋菌否。凡此等等均爲根治急性淋之基本條件，然後注射特製自家菌苗，以抗淋殺菌，並使其發生免疫性作用，更用德國濾淋平流電療法，將殺菌的電熱，直接透射病灶間之淋菌，按照此方針根治急性淋，更隨症施以無痛而敏捷的手術，可以當天止痛，即日淸濁消炎，根治之速與澈底，每出一般拖泥帶水療法之上。</p>

<h3>歐局的癥結</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>歐局的不得安定，固然由於狼子野心，張牙舞爪，狂肆兇鋒，而張伯倫的得過且過，實在是養癥貽患的最大原因。因爲我早就說過，要貪殘者知道饜足，適可而止，正如與虎謀皮，是決計不會成爲事實的，惟一的辦法，就只有用强力制止其淮行，或嚴密包圍，或迎頭打擊，那末牠就知難而退，戢尾而逃了。</p>
<p>現在張伯倫果然有些覺悟，在想法予以包圍了；然而還是不徹底，癥結仍在，將來終必有潰決之一日，而使病菌得以肆其虐害。爲什麽呢？這也是我一再說過的，歐局沒有蘇聯出來參加，總不得安定，而張伯倫却始終無意於此，歐局在現在是個僵局，在將來也一定是個悲局！</p>
<p>昨報載英國歐戰時首相勞合喬治的演說，格外堅定了我這個信念，我對於他的觀察，充份表示同意。他以爲現在英政府雖然在邀請羅馬尼亞，希臘，南斯拉夫各小國，加入反侵略集團，假使沒有蘇聯的贊助，終屬徒勞無益。因此，他積極主張：「英國倘與蘇聯成立軍事諒解，而將英法兩國與蘇聯之實力予以聯合，一俟任何獨裁國出以侵略時，即協力加以反抗，其實效之大，殆非可言喩。」不過他又說：「顧英法兩國苟非提供切實保證，聲明不尙空談，則蘇聯決不出而合作。」是呀，蘇聯不是傻子，何必自吿奮勇，吃力不討好呢？反正中歐的烏烟瘴氣，是絕劉不會染到她那赤色的國旗上面去的！</p>
<p>這就是歐局的癥結：蘇聯不參加任何集體行動。這就是癥結的癥結；英法始終不要蘇聯出來參加，而蘇聯也就落得閉關自守，安度其世外桃源的生活。</p>
<p>爲什麼英法，允其英，會這樣呢？她們果然不知道麽？不，不；她們很知道。可是，她們，尤其英，正如勞合喬治所說，總以爲憑她們的努力，凡事就可迎刃而解，不必請敎蘇聯。此外，也正如我一再指出過的，她們怕蘇聯，甚於怕德義，因此，她們防蘇聯，甚於防德義。至於她們爲什麽會如此，說來固然話長，然而一言以蔽之，只是她們的自私心太重，而目光又過於短淺而已！</p>
<p>昨天美國一華盛頓郵報」，也有勞合喬治一樣的評論，我們正可以取來參觀，互相發明。</p>
<p>歐局不安定的癥結在此，世界不安定的癥結也在此。我非有所偏愛於蘇聯，然而我不禁要喊：蘇聯不出，如歐局何！蘇聯不出，如世界何！</p>
<h3>嫁女兒</h3>
<p>— 明枝</p>
<p>——老奶奶的故事</p>
<p>自從上次攻城之後，又一連對靑鎭襲擊了幾次。攻下來的城鎭雖然不能駐守，必須放棄，而消耗敵人的目的，却就達到了。不過我們也是付以少量的代價的，王明源這一夥人，和其他若干夥人，一共犧牲了十万個，受傷了二十七個，輕傷不等，分住在各村各家的最隱僻處。</p>
<p>這天上午，看護兵魏炳成急得很，就來跟王明源商量。他說：「所有的綳帶和消毒藥品，都將要用完了，而這些醫藥品的取給所，却在二十里外的蕭鎭，沒有方法去取來，怎麼辦？」</p>
<p>「派兩個弟兄去，不是就成了麼？」王明源的意見。</p>
<p>「可是這裏到蕭鎭之間，到處都有鬼子的踪跡，而必須越過的運河，他們更其守得嚴密，在那幾頂橋上，帶了那些醫藥品，怎麽走得回來呢？」</p>
<p>王明源搔了一下頭，忽然若有所悟的樣子，高興地拍着大腿說：「有了有了，還是請老奶奶去！」</p>
<p>老奶奶在屋後餵猪，聽見王明源呌她，就走了出來。王明源將事情的原委吿訴了她，末了加上一句說：「難爲你再扮一下化子吧。」</p>
<p>「不成！」老奶奶立刻回答說。</p>
<p>「什麼？你不願意了麽？」</p>
<p>「不，」老奶奶微微一笑，「第一，照老辦法，要防人家議破；，第二，這次的東西多些，大些，不能帶在身上，必須另外想法才是。」</p>
<p>「對對！」王明源不能不承認。一但是那怎麽辦呢？」</p>
<p>「你交給我，我有法子。不過你須給我三十塊錢，我有用塲。」</p>
<p>王明源毫不懐疑地將三十塊錢交給了她。魏炳成則將貯藏醫藥品的地方吿訴了她。</p>
<p>吃了午飯，老奶奶就和她的兒子阿和一同出發。她改變了以前的裝束，穿了簇新的衣履，打扮成了鄕間小康人家的太太。阿和推着小軍，載着她走。</p>
<p>「明天這時，你們就可以有東西了。」這是老奶奶在衆人歡送聲中的臨別贈言。</p>
<p>他們，母子倆，走了十里光量，就到了必須經過的北橋。果然，橋東有幾個黃衣人在把守着。老奶奶在看得見黃衣人的地方，就下車走着，緩緩地領着阿和的車子走向橋來。</p>
<p>一黃衣人的面前，除了照例鞠躬以外，老奶奶就自動將衣服解開了些，拍拍抖抖，表示身無他物，而阿和則張着兩手，由他們檢査。</p>
<p>「那裏去？」生硬的中國話。</p>
<p>「靑鎭去。」老奶奶笑着說，神氣非常從容，自有使人相信她而不敢冒犯她的力量。</p>
<p>「幹什麽？」</p>
<p>「閨女要出嫁，去辦些東西。」</p>
<p>「你住那裏？」</p>
<p>「王家村。請你先生來喝喜酒。」是樂意的邀請。</p>
<p>黃衣人的臉上都鬆了一下勁，其中一個將手一揮說：「去去，早些回來。」</p>
<p>「明天上午一定回來。」</p>
<p>他們過了橋，就急急向靑鎭出發。</p>
<p>靑鎭是很大的，在惡勢力的範圍內，仍有畸形的熱鬧。他們盡兩三小時的力量，買了許多東西，其中有被頭兩條，枕頭一對，馬桶，提桶，脚盆，油鹽醬醋，以致草紙肥皂等等。每一樣東西，都向店家要了發票，發票上有「靑鎭自治會」的印章。</p>
<p>他們將東西一買好，立刻就裝在小車上，在暮色蒼茫中，趕到相近魏炳成所說的一個小村去。</p>
<p>到了那裏，由於老奶奶的指揮，邀致了幾個婦女，作成了她所要作的事。</p>
<p>明大早上，老奶奶和阿和就動身回來。車上除了她的座位以外，都裝滿了東西。</p>
<p>在北橋的西堍，他們又遭受着黃衣人的搜查。不等他們動手，阿和將每一樣東西都搬下車來，攤在地上；不等他們開口，老奶奶指着一件一件的東西吿訴他們：</p>
<p>「這是被頭；這是枕頭；……這是一鼚豆油；這是一鼚醬油；這是鹽；……這是黃豆，要磨豆腐；……都是靑鎭買的，回去嫁女兒」。又將發票取出來給他們看。</p>
<p>黃衣人起先很認眞的檢查，可是看看每樣東西，或者放在手裏掂播掂播，覺得也沒有什麼可疑的，隨後就逐漸懈怠了下來。老奶奶却在此時又提起了兩樣東西，交給他們，說</p>
<p>「這是一壺酒，送給你們解一回渴；這是幾包香烟，送給你們吹吹。」</p>
<p>他們接受這些東西時，居然臉上有了笑容。</p>
<p>「嫁女兒……吃喜酒……」僵着舌頭在學着。</p>
<p>「是的，請你們來吃喜酒，」老奶奶格外笑着說，「在王家村，二十里，很近。」</p>
<p>在他們吹出來的縷縷香烟中，阿和將一切東西重新收拾了起來，和他的母親一同過橋走着。</p>
<p>「你們來吃喜酒啊，」老奶奶？對東堍的黃衣人說。</p>
<p>老奶奶一坐上車子，就走得很快，果然在昨天出發的時光，他們就到了家。</p>
<p>「什麽？你買了這些東西回來？」王明源驚奇地問。</p>
<p>「是的；我要嫁女兒呢！」她這一說，她和阿和就大笑了起來。</p>
<p>「嫁女兒？」除了他們母子二人外，大家都不懂。</p>
<p>「你們不必問我，聽我的話，你們動手吧。」老奶奶吩咐着。「先拆那被頭。」</p>
<p>他們七手八脚拆了開來，呀，裏面的被心，除了面上是一層薄薄的棉花以外，當中鋪的盡是繃帶和橡皮膏布。另一條被頭是如此，兩個枕頭也是如此。他們明白了；他們只有歡笑。</p>
<p>老奶奶又指揮他們，將鼚裏的油酒等類，倒到別的器皿裏去，鼚底就出現了一瓶一瓶的消毒藥水。還有呢：在糖和鹽的底下，揀出了金鷄納霜丸和愛斯匹靈丸藥；在黃豆底下揀出了其他應用藥品。而這些糖和鹽等，則都是放在新買的提桶，脚盆，甚至馬桶裏的。</p>
<p>「老奶奶眞是天才！」魏炳成說，「這些醫藥品，很可以用一些時候了。」</p>
<p>「那一樣沒有用呢？」王明源也稱讚着說：「有的好吃，有的好用，還該多買些呢。」</p>
<p>「再多些就推不動了，」阿和也笑着說。</p>
<p>他們在歡笑中，將一切東西都放好了。</p>
<p>晚飯時，他們喝着　得有的酒，都很高興，歡呼着說：</p>
<p>「老奶奶嫁閨女，我們喝呀，哈哈哈！……」</p>
<h3>收復我們的家鄕！</h3>
<h3>懷鄕和文人</h3>
<p>— 包瀟雲</p>
<p>在目前，差不多每個人都有着這一種懐鄕的心理，尤其是我們的文人。</p>
<p>文人是會動動筆，寫寫字的，他們的地位在人羣中自然與衆不同」，這是明顯的事。所以他們懐鄉時的一切，也和平常人多少有點異樣。</p>
<p>平常人常懐念他們的故鄕時，大不了吶喊幾聲，發洩些牢騷；或是對着人扮苦臉，一會兒長吁，一會兒短嘆；還有比較粗暴些的，也祇有拍拍桌子，跳跳脚，如此而已。此外再也沒有比較新鮮的。</p>
<p>——但一說到我們的文人，却不然了，他們除去發牢騷，跳脚，嘆氣以外，還有寫文章——有一定章法的文章——這一項是平常人及不來的。而又是懐鄕最好的工具。所以我們的文人大足以「自豪」。</p>
<p>假使有人實在敬佩得很，那不妨稱幾聲：「大哉文人！文人之前，從無……」</p>
<p>我們的文人眞是萬能，當「心血來潮」想起故鄕時，便揮這麽幾筆，寫成什麽詩啦，散文啦，……花樣眞多，可說，「色色齊備」，並且都是「曲盡其妙」！</p>
<p>有時我們的文人一高興，便把他們的「大作」送到報紙或是雜誌上去發表，使誰都能欣賞一下。</p>
<p>有時，說不定起初寫的時候，「愁眉苦臉」，待到寫完篇時，便會「笑逐顏開」的來一下，免掉再想起故鄕。……</p>
<p>閒話說得太多，爲了「適應現實」，姑且拉了轉來，談談當前的事吧。</p>
<p>誰都知道：現在是全面抗戰的時期，所以我們的文人提筆寫懐鄕的文章時，也和平時不同。平時，吟些「風花雪月」的詩句，寫些「不關痛癢」的文章，似乎還可以；——但這在今天却講不通，因此爲了配合抗戰，無論寫那一種的懐鄕文章，最好都拖到這上面去，表示我們的文人，不僅懐鄕，還連帶懐國哩！</p>
<p>由上面一點，可以看出我們的文人的精神，的確和大時代的進展，「並駕齊騷」！</p>
<p>還有，値得提起又値得欽佩的，就是我們的文人思想似乎很統一。爲什麽呢？因爲我見到有十分之九關於這一類的文字是「差不多」的。也許有時形式有差別，內容却總是「大同小異」。</p>
<p>總之，懐鄕和文人，有着密切的關係，這是誰都不能否認的。他們不但有「圓轉如意」的表演方法，還有使人「迥腸盪氣」的魄力哩！</p>
<p>要是有好閒的人，假使高興，不妨費去一些工夫，把抗戰以後關於這一類的文章，彙成一起，編成一部大叢書，像什麽備要，什麼叢刋之類，我想一定有生意。或許出版時資金不够，那不妨先來發售「預約」，收到現款再說，這樣一來，似乎懐鄕也可以發財了！</p>
<h3>心底的歌聲</h3>
<p>— 柳攸</p>
<p>早晨，晚間——在我們活着的時候，心底內總是放出歌聲，永遠不會有一個極短的時間停止。</p>
<p>這歌聲，在我們的心底內，牠是靈魂的高呼，牠是精神的吶喊！</p>
<p>歌聲雖是美麗的，却不是同樣的歌！</p>
<p>有時，那尖銳的聲音，好似鳥獸的悲鳴；那嗚咽的微聲，好似幽靈的泣訴；有時，那憾動一切的巨聲，好似虎嘯獅吼，那驚入的奮呼，好似戰塲的搏鬥！</p>
<p>歌聲，這不同的歌聲，從未有靜止的時候。</p>
<p>但是這歌聲，雖然在悲泣，怒吼，狂呼，但是從未失却這謳歌的正義。</p>
<p>無論在什麽時候，心底的歌聲，不斷地在呼着：「我們是人，我們要享受人的權利！」</p>
<p>惡魔的長嘯，鬼怪的嘶喊，抑低不着正義之歌。</p>
<p>悲泣，吶喊，這心底的歌聲，爲人類的生存而詠唱，這是偉大的。</p>
<p>歌聲，心底的歌聲，永遠不能靜息啊！</p>

<h3>金融　港帮復來吸收　現金價稍向上升　—已逼達二零七零元關口—</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、情勢初平繼漲、上午雖某銀樓復代港帮吸購、奈爲數有限、且其時銀樓帮吐售尙殷、致雙方供求頭寸尙屬平衡、因之局勢殊平、極鮮變幻、而下午因港帮買意復萌、加以賣方多懷觀望、致價梢向上升、結果軋漲五元、交易淸淡、上下午約四百兩、銀　飾金未見更動、海　金仍平、中英純金等復向下游</p>
<p>烚赤暗市軋高五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因供求稀少、致久無做開、直至十時後、方見錢兌業賣予銀樓帮五十兩、二千〇六十四元爲開盤價、較之前收未分上落、開後相同價某銀樓進同業百兩、繼之銀樓帮又互做五十兩、價仍六十四元、後某金號進銀樓帮五十兩、爲六十五元、逾半小時後又見金號售予銀樓帮五十兩、價亦六十五元、時已十一點許、後囚供求更缺、故未見做開、致午收價仍爲六十五元、午後交易益淸、而價因某銀樓復代港帮吸購、日賣者觀望故市勢步堅、在二時半後、某銀樓進金號五十兩、價六十九元、不久又進金號五十兩價則相同、此後未見做開、故晚收價仍爲二千〇六十九元、結果較之前收軋漲五元、全天五元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千〇七十五元、收進二千〇六十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>

<h3>英美滙市　依然未分榮潤港匯先鬆後平</h3>
<p>滙市昨以油洋行美孚曁各大洋行等雖有結款、但因外行如滙豐等、尙肯塞出、並略有互做六月份美匯交易、是以過程呆定、而鮮變化、結果仍無榮辱、交易尙旺、至港滙初開、一度帶硬、嗣因聞香港電訊堅昂、於是形勢、遂轉軟化、終則　　、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近期仍平遠期回跌〇六二五、紐約銀價依然呆定、倫敦生金降半辦士、滙兌英對美·對滬均平、對法大四生丁、美對英·對滬均無更動、對法長六二五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開賣價、英滙八辦士二五、美滙十六元〇六二五較之前收、均無上落、開後洋行與某行互相扒結英滙、但以英行滙豐仍肯源源供給、是以缺乏變化、洋行某行結進滙豐英滙八辦士二五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無升降、仍徵百分之五·〇〇、此後洋行續購結荷蘭、華比英滙八辦士二五、兼又扒結某行美滙十六元〇六二五、繼之外商銀行互做美滙六月份十六元〇三一二五、是以過程仍鮮變化、其時港匯形勢頗硬、外行對於五十六元二五、有供售之意、但不久因聞香港電訊堅昂、對英長　三一二五、對美長（）六二五、於是賣方供意轉淡、而扒者漸湧致形勢遂立轉軟化、將近午時、外行賣予洋行港滙五十六元、迨午收銀行賣價、與晨開無異、</p>

<h3>英銀遠期回降</h3>
<p>十三日倫敦電、銀市略有了結交易、兼投機家賣出遠期、市面平穩、收盤後平而帶硬、印度及花旗商人少數照掛牌價買進、但出者保留、大條銀近期仍平、遠期回縮〇六二五、紐約銀電、現貨呆定如故、又孟買電、印銀市况平靜、現貨與四月回跌一安那、五月則未更動、</p>
<h3>貼現又小</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、突又下落、當日　千元之貼率、仍盤於四十七元七角半至四十八元間、最後四十七元七角半、比前日又低落二角半、</p>
<h3>紗花　二十支雙馬紗　囤戶獲利出籠　市價未能隨粗細紗而續昂</h3>
<p>紗市　覺平順、蓋以南方一帶需要雖較　爲减色、然零星交易尙不間斷、且前幾日潮汕港滇等帮、裝運現貨爲數又鉅、故近日現紗根子、不像昔日之鬆濫、市盤較可穩定耳、然二十支雙馬昂中帶軟狀、實緣消費固旺、然其生產數量益繁、且囤戶手中揑貨亦不弱、市價漲高時稍能獲利脫卸者、殊不乏人、所以漲風未能積極前進、上日午後人氣、異常俏俐、在頂峯價收盤、就往年過去市况之經騐觀測、昨日開市必漲無疑、詛料反覺比上日之價爲低落、照此情况觀之、現紗市塲之走勢、殊難揣測也、總之目前尙在堅硬中盤旋、新姿態非待旺銷來推動、一時尙難實現也、惟十支粗紗及三二支四二支紗綫買氣盎然而挺云、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨利開盤、因天雨集會者較平時爲遲、市况平定無勁、開價跌一元半、二十支雙馬紗價爲三百九十四元、以實需不及上日之夥、同時上日午後活動之國戶、昨日未來吸收、據云等待市價回挫一些、再振旗鼓、內中稍有做作、亦未可知、不過就事實上論之、二十支紗籌碼尙嫌充足、中途稍疲、雙馬價做至三百九十二元七角半、迨至收盤復見回升、午後開盤轉趨緊象、蓋價疲又乏人賣出、二十支雙馬價爲三百九十四元半至五元、四二支雙股綫漲力尤熾、査全日各帮買去統計一千二百十包、行情二十支雙馬·天女比上日價跌五角至一元、十支組紗堅挺、惟四二支漲五元、廠方由新裕開出二十支雙地球一百包、價爲三百八十五元、今日出口棉紗有九百件運香港、三白八十件運廣州灣、七百四十件運海防、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>雲南　八〇　汕頭　一八〇</p>
<p>內地　六〇　同行　五三〇</p>
<p>溫州　二五　泉州　五</p>
<p>江西　七五　香港　一八五</p>
<p>福州　四五　天津　二五</p>
<p>統計一、二一〇</p>
<p>日紗市面依然紊亂不堪、市塲中一片烏烟瘴氣之象其中流動掮客之呌價、往往有幾元相差、不足爲奇也、可想內中輸贏殊巨、昨日市價下跌幾元、二十支藍鳳紗本月份價爲三百五十六·七元、水月未有實在價格做開云、</p>
<h3>美農業救濟費　有增至四萬萬元說　下級巴西棉每担電漲三元餘一年來外面輸入約五十萬包</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日較呈活躍、空頭略有抵補、同業亦稍有交易、華盛頓方面雖無發展消息、然農部秘書亨利威爾斯呈請政府、要求各議員贊同彼之提案、請政府增給農業救濟費四萬萬兀、俾使棉麥出口津貼得以實現、藉此全世界需要原棉時、貸款棉可乘機銷空、此說與棉價之將來、確有極大之影響也、昨日紐約略漲四五磅音、印棉連同預測漲一羅比、埃及漲十餘磅音、匯兌平平、折合法幣、棉價計美棉漲二角、印棉漲三角、埃及漲八角餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、各廠對於印棉略有訂購、巴西棉交易亦佳、允以下級巴西爲甚、蓋因能紡四十二支之下級巴西、每担祇售七十三元餘、較之國棉廉宜殊甚、昨日某行因此項下級巴西與高級者相離太甚、深恐將來地頭難以購得、故來電每担漲三元餘、茲將昨日棉價折合送廠計算如下、</p>
<p>外棉折合市價</p>
<p>本棉生意仍無發展氣象、實則貨物缺乏、廠方雖有辨意、亦無從下手、因之市情入於停頓之途、申新廠買進美種打包花六百件、目的採取其顏色白亮玉潔之美處、攙拼印棉之需用、其他廠家殊無動靜、同業亦束手不辦矣、蘇北來源又受阻梗、而見凋零、通花碼頭上僅到七十包、北沙來九十三件、浙棉亦不准出口、常熟太倉等處存棉尙有二三成、然鄕間盜匪甚熾、路中運輸、搶刦之事時有所聞、商販爲血本計、裹足不前、棉市在此混亂局面中、不堪設想也、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<p>又訊、近來華英廠絡續　出粗細紗綫之額量、將近二三萬包、對於原棉當然補進、無奈處此環境中從何處着手、所以非向海外購訂外棉補充不足以救濟也、茲據某行消息、在最近時間、各方約訂十五萬包以外、每包印棉（四百磅）、美棉（五百磅）、又有一說、自上年至目前止、中外各廠購買外棉約有五十萬包、每包約計國幣二百元、資金外溢、約計一萬萬元、</p>
<p>印棉又有運來、聞明午到滬之英輪喀粹奇（譯音）號、自孟買裝來棉花五百四十八件、起卸於浦東其昌棧、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布客銷　始終不懈　本市門莊銷數驚人</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>昨日市勢堅挺、售盤有漲無跌、緣華南川·滇·粵·閩·現需續活、北路天津帮動辦花色布疋仍殷、本街印染廠吸納坯布亦未稍懈、即本市門莊銷量、亦保持驚人巨額、且業內外囤戶、頗多墊購秋冬當銷之各種存貨、天津帮亦預早落手訂購六·七月份綫呢、七·八·九月份絨布三百餘箱、印花絨本街及川帮開售一千餘箱、原開每碼二角八分五釐、刻每碼已升至三角、昨市盤頗少軒輊、怡和金三塔漂布因閩帮連購數十箱、同業手貨漸稀、每疋提漲一角半、白貨粗布交易轉暢、本客帮成交三百餘包、囤戶亦有揑進百餘包、本街染廠購染坯細斜紋　百數十包、浙東甬帮雖停辦、而贛南·廣豐·河口諸地、需胃巴有起色、昨續辦雜項棉布拚件一千數百疋、溫州帮僅辦粗布細布白貨五六十包、</p>
<p>東布</p>
<p>白貨市盤微昂、昨本街染業需胃又殷、採辦各牌細布·細斜一千餘件北帮天津·靑島·亦辦細布二百餘包、售盤每疋提升五分左右、十二磅龍頭細布後市喊盤須十三元、做開十二元九元五分、同業心思殊堅、即色貨嗶嘰直貢、訂開亦夥、四君子嗶嘰現售每碼四角二分半、期貨互相拋售者甚形熱鬧、</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>今日有疋頭　件、運往汕頭、二百件、運往香港、一百件運廣州灣、四百七十件、運海防、</p>
<h3>維也納羢　暴漲元餘</h3>
<p>三天維也納絨、因天氣轉熱、實銷蠕動、致買方需要增夥、而其標準行情、則頗爲高昂、回顧去年售價、每碼暴漲一元餘、按定到奇缺、舊存乏貨、新貨成本驟貴、故水漲船高、較之其他呢絨暴漲尤甚、查其他呢紙上漲一元餘者雖多、然都係雙幅、惟此單幅之三天維也納絨、暴漲竟亦超過一元以上、若以雙幅推算、每碼豈不成了騰漲三元餘矣、漲勢之猛、亦可謂大矣、昨市眞三天維也納絨躉批現鈔每碼俱開售五元八角淨盤、査去年祇售四元七角半、尙可扣佣廿六年未戰前、通常祗售三元六七角耳、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋粉喊高五分　廠粉暢銷轉穩　本麥交易又吿沉寂</h3>
<p>廠粉　漸轉穩定、緣近日客帮銷塲、逐步活潑、各廠原擬與洋粉競爭、故將廠盤略事遷就、嗣以連日洋粉市價步挺、且大戶執存之貨、均不願輕易脫手、於是廠盤亦無形帶緊、統市成交車船各牌粉併計五六萬包、除本街零批的有七八千包外、悉由南北兩帮辦去、二號粉廠盤本客一律售開四元四角、但廠方已有喊高之表示云、</p>
<p>十五日麵粉出口、運威海衛二千包、運烟台一萬七千五百包、</p>
<p>洋粉　洋粉零星小票、續有抵埠、木客交易、自淸明節以來、銷路頗稱活躍、蓋大帮烟津秦皇島等處、業已辦裝不少、均係中檔牌子花旗粉爲大宗、統市本客繼續活動、但近日市上浮存漸感不豐、大戶手中所執之貨、均擬待價而脫、故昨市零躉批價、均已喊高五分、計開蝙蝠雙鷹金馬等牌、共二萬四千餘包、價爲四元三角五分（滙劃）、聞老牌如紅日當天等牌、售價已達四元五角半滙劃、又聞本街零批爲四元三角八分現鈔送到連費在內、蓋目下期貨暫難接近、人心頗見鞏固、市面一時恐不易過小、</p>
<p>本麥　交易又吿沉靜、因新到之貨一霎售罄、市塲供源復寂、廠胃亦屬覜望、故市面又吿停頓、</p>
<h3>粳秈銷路清淡</h3>
<p>市傳新定西貢米將到</p>
<p>杜粳　昨日各帮來源河下祗到七八號、車輪包子二千餘包、本街及囤戶胃口猶屬懈淡、惟售方因到貨續稀、天雨連綿、心思頗堅、是以各貨做開寥寥、市面勉呈定局、若厚薄粳及杜洋尖埠尖價悉無甚上落、變兀去路亦澀、市色亦帶疲角許、</p>
<p>客秈　連日到頭絡繹不絕、而去路僅有本街一路、市上賣氣充塞、行情遂步抑低、目下行販勤於搬運、人心更軟、昨市京蕪各秈續小一二角、南京秈十二元八九角、蕪京秈祗十二元七八角、成交二千包之譜、目在客秈源源抵　之際、市上尙有謠傳西貢新定一批將到、故後形尙不易回站、惟西貢現貨久呈挺站、高貨寳塔牌討價十七兀半、工部局回籠貨十七元二角半云、</p>

<h3>昌興公司概況（上）</h3>
<p>— 鄧炳銓</p>
<p>昌興公司Canadina　Pacific　Seamship　&amp;　Railways　執太平洋航行業之牛耳，已歷有年所。該公司總經理波蒙氏　Mr.H.B.Beaumont幹練有為，成此大業，素為世界人士所景仰。波氏昔游遠東，不侫曾與接晤，至深敬佩，頃見波氏自撰一文，緣為迻譯左：</p>
<p>昌興公司的橫渡太平洋來務，自一八九一年志開辦，現在這航綫的輪船，有日本皇後號，總重二六·〇〇〇噸，加拿大皇後號，總重二一·五〇〇噸，俄羅斯皇後號，總重一六·八〇〇噸，亞細亞皇後號，總重一六·九〇〇噸，每隔二週，即有一輪行駛於溫哥華·維多利亞·與東方各港口間。</p>
<p>日本皇後號和加拿大皇後號所循的航綫，是從溫哥華出發，經維多利亞，火奴魯魯，橫濱，神戶，上海，香港和馬尼刺而返英。俄羅斯皇後號與亞細亞皇後號，橫濱，神戶，長崎，上海，香港，至馬尼刺而返英。溫哥華經火奴魯魯而至馬尼刺問，計程八·四五八哩，航行需時二十一天。</p>
<p>昌興公司輪船橫渡太平洋者，執來往西雅圖西北各太平洋岸温哥華和维多利亞間載客交通的牛耳，遠勝來往這此港口間其他相競爭的輪船。除這些堅強的交通地位外，還有下列數點，可證明昌興公司太平洋航務實居首位：（一）日本皇後號保持一切橫渡太平洋的最快紀錄，（二）直航太平洋海岸與日本間的輪船，以俄羅斯皇後號與亞細亞皇後號為最迅速。</p>
<p>自一九二九年十二月起，昌興公司的橫渡太平洋各皇後號輪，開始兼灣火奴魯魯，這是該公司太平洋業務的重要轉變，溫哥華與火奴魯魯間，以及火奴魯魯與東方間的交通，都有增加，據統計證實，在近幾年的不景氣時期中，昌興公司收入的增漲，兼灣火奴魯魯，是個堅強的因素。</p>
<p>自一八九三年起，昌興公司的輪船開始啣接南洋羣島，紐絲綸和澳洲。最初行駛綫的是密烏惠拉號輪，總重三·三九三噸，自溫哥華駛往雪梨，澳洲，途經維多利亞，火奴魯魯，與蘇伐各地，其後輪船噸位迭有更變，但該綫的業務，繼續紐絲綸的奧克蘭，至今未有更變。一九三一年總重一三·四一五噸的尼亞加拉號輪，一九二五年總生一七·四九一噸的馬達輪奧蘭奇號，相繼加入此綫航行，其後未有添置，今每隔四星期航行一次，自溫哥華到雪梨，計程七·六三九哩，航行需二十三天。</p>
<p>在加拿大和美國，昌興公司委託加拿大太平鐵道公司為交通代理機關。在富士島，紐絲綸和澳洲，委託聞合輪船公司為交通代理機關。但在東方的東京，橫濱，神戶，上海，香港和馬尼刺，都自設辦事處，而以香港為東方的輪船載客管轄着很大的區域，包括日本，朝鮮，東三省，中國，菲列賓羣島，荷蘭東印度，婆雜洲，法屬印度支那，暹邏，馬來聯邦，緬甸，錫蘭，和印度。在香港以南的區域，並未自設辦事處，但有代理機關，等恢復常態時，或將在印度主要中心地之一，或新加坡自設辦事處。（未完）</p>
<h3>滇越鐵路上之米許林車</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>內地公路詳記</h3>
<p>— 景洵</p>
<p>自從戰事發生以來，我國内地的公路建設，日見進展。國際性的，有滇緬西蘭公路等，其工程的偉大，實堪驚人。就西南西北各省而言，其公路的繁密，亦是國人所共見的。其他沿海各省，如福建，廣東，廣西，浙江的公路建設，亦是一日千里的展發。內地的交通，旣已全賴公路，一般人對於公路上旅行的經騐，大都還是異常生疏，寫此文的目的，無非是想把內地各公路的詳細情形，如里程，票價，及沿途住宿等等，分別敘述，以利行旅。現在在沒有寫正文以前，先把在公路上旅行所應該注意的幾點，以供參考：</p>
<p>往內地旅行，携帶行李的數量，是越少越好，但是出門人的携帶行李，事實上是不可免的，為避免旅途上的麻煩起見，還是少帶為妙。內地各公路當局，對於旅客携帶行李的規定，大都是一律的，每人准帶免費行李的數量，均以二十公斤為限，超過免費數量的行李，每公里每五公斤，其取費為國幣四分六厘至五分不定。假使行李過多，納起行李費來，頗為驚人，並且公路當局對於一般多帶行李的旅客，往往會拒絕搭乘。那時候，弄得進退兩難，還是預先籌劃的好。再者公路汽車上，對於行李及乘客，是分別裝運的，每輛汽車的後面，劃出一部分來，成為凹字式，這塊地方，將是用來堆置行李用的；所以旅客在出發前，就是該除較大的行李（大都是衣箱鋪蓋等等）外，一個小型的手提箱或藤包，是免不了的。該箱以長廿四英寸闊，十八英寸者為宜，中間安置些日常用品，置在座位下面，易於時常開取應用，免得去開動大行李了。公路汽車上的座位，大槪每輛車內，共有十八個座位，以坐在司機旁邊的那一個座位最為舒適。如坐在汽車的尾部，很易受傷顛簸之苦，車中座位擠得一無空隙，一俟該車開出，乘客竟動彈不得，所以隨身携帶的嗽口杯及毛巾，最好入在手邊，以使吐痰或因暈車吐嘔時可以利用牠。其他如手電筒水瓶藥品等等，都是旅行所必備的物件，同時在內地旅行所，一份身份證書，是很重要的，因為在入某一省的省境時，都要受到檢查，有了那東西，就可便利不少。現在將各公路的情形分述如后：</p>
<p>（甲）西南公路　西南各省，民含雲南，貴州，四川，西康，為軸心，而以廣東，廣西，湖北，湖南為外　。各省間的交通，除有湘桂，粵漢，湘黔，敘昆等鐵路外，其公路共分四大幹路：北自四川之重慶，經貴陽，西通昆明，南通柳州以達桂林。由貴陽東通長沙。從這幾條幹路，可以轉達到各省的許多支路，其交通的規模，是相當偉大的了。</p>
<p>（二）昆明到貴陽　昆明高出海面一千九百餘公尺，氣候溫和，較熱鬧的市街為正義路，金碧路等，中國旅行社所設的昆明商務酒店，設備很佳。其他較次的旅館，有得意春，新生，昌新等數家。價目單人房每日約國幣一元二角，雙人房二元四角，佳青年會似乎最合宜，但是不常有空房間。由昆明到貴陽，距離六百六十二公里，乘坐公路汽車，要三日才能到達貴陽。第一日由昆明出發到平　，這段距離二三七公里，車行約八小時可達，中途在曲靖午膳，晚宿平　；平　有中國旅行社的特約招待所，平　旅社，一宿二餐，僅需七角。平　是雲南境最後一個檢查的地方。第二日由平　出發到安南，這段距離一八三公里，中途要經過「廿四之字拐」頗是危險，所謂「廿四之字拐」者，就是汽車爬一高山，像「之」字樣的開上去，一共連着廿四次。因此汽車要走九小時半方能到達安南。中途在磐縣午膳，晚宿安南。安南有中國旅行社招待所，單人房一元五角，雙人房二元，鋪位七角，加床五角，客飯每客五角，這段距離二四二公里，車行約八小時可達，中途在安順午膳。要經過黃菓樹，這是世界有名的大瀑布的所在，很是壯觀。貴陽雖是平地，但四面環山，實在還是一個山谷。市面不若昆明繁華，物價很貴。旅館有貴州省政府委託中國旅行社辦理的招待所，價目每間國幣二元。餐每客五角，其他旅館，有貴州大飯店等，但是設備很是簡單。由昆明到貴陽，每人免費行李是二十公斤，逾量的行李每五公斤取費一元九角八分六厘，由貴陽到昆明的行程相反。（待續）</p>
<h3>浙贛交通依然便捷</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>浙贛鐵路為入內地之要道，自南昌陷落，該路驟告中斷，唯該路仍能照常分段行駛，東段由金華可抵離金華三百餘公里之江西貴溪，行車時刻未定。其票價三等為國幣五元五角，二等倍之：頭等再倍之。此段行駛約需十小時，抵貴溪後可設法循公路至吉安。（此段公路情形待有正確之調查後再行詳述）江西省公路處每日有客車由吉安開往界化隴，當日可達，票價國幣八元六角九分。由界化隴可轉換湘省公路車直達衡陽，票價十一元六角五分。中途在茶陵住宿一宵，頗稱便利。至於浙贛鐵路西段，可由宜春通車至株州，行車約六小時，三等票價為國幣三元六角五分。由株州可循粵漢鐵路至衡陽，該段距離僅一百三十七公里，行車約六小時可達，票價三等一元七角五分。由衡陽至桂林之湘桂鐵路衡桂段之行車時刻暫無變動，由此轉入內地，亦頗便利。</p>
<h3>渝蓉航空</h3>
<p>— 景</p>
<p>（重慶）至成都，航程里數為二八〇公里，中國航空公司飛機每日往返飛行，星期二四六日上午八時由渝起飛，同日上午九時十分到達成都。星期一三五下午二時三十分起飛，同日下午四時三十分到達。由成都飛回重慶，星期一三五為中午十二時飛，下午二時到。星期二十二時飛，下午二時到。星期二四六日上午九時二十五分飛，十時三十五分到。歐亞航空公司飛機於每星期三五下午零點四十分開，二點零五分抵蓉。由蓉返渝，為同日下午二點三十五分起飛，四時抵渝。上述二公司票價，一律為國幣一百零五元。</p>
<h3>博喜火星塞效用可靠鐵證</h3>
<p>據確實調查，一九三八年度舉行之國際汽車競賽一五九次，及造成之世界速率紀錄十七個，其奪得錦標及創造紀錄之汽車。所裝配之火星塞，實均為博喜牌。按博喜火星塞，以經濟耐用效用可靠著名於世者，歷有年所，上述調查，蓋其可靠之又一鐵證也。博喜火星塞，係由本埠捷成洋行總經理，現聞該行運到大批新貨，售價頗為克已，本埠各汽車材料行均有出售。</p>

<h3>西安至蘭州</h3>
<p>— 葆丞</p>
<p>考西北公路，計川陜，西蘭，蘭秦，蘭猩，甘青，西荊，漢白七綫：其幹綫當以西蘭及川陜兩線為主體。川陜線由四川成都，直達陜西之西安，全長八百餘公里，行程四日，為溝通西南北之要途。至西蘭公路則為西北交通之惟一幹路，起自陜西之西安，經咸陽，醴泉，邠縣，涇川，平涼，隆德，界石舖，華家嶺，定西等處，以達甘肅之蘭州，全長約七百公里，行程約四日。沿途風景壯偉，又與西南各路情形不同。該路現由交通部西北公路管理局管轄，通車以來，旅客稱便。自去年間該路局即約定中國旅行社在沿途辦理食宿站及客貨運輸事宜，現已設立之招待所，為邠縣，平涼，華家嶺，蘭州，數處。將來視旅客情形如何，必有所改進。西北公路局於三月一日起，對於客票價目，已重改訂，係按照每客每公里四分五厘計算者。自西安出發第一日宿邠縣，第二日宿平涼，第三日宿華家嶺，第四日卽可抵蘭州矣。惟近來車輛，時感缺乏，故行車時刻，不能凖確，以致沿途膳宿，亦未能按照規定處所停車，為其缺點。聞西北公路局，現正力求發展，將來握西北交通之樞紐，貫通甘肅與外界這運輸，使命重大，前途正未可忽視也。</p>
<h3>鵬程六十號小汽車及送貨車</h3>
<p>日內卽可到滬</p>
<p>鵬程六十號小汽車Bantam　“60”及送貨車，為美國鵬程汽車廠出品；以最為經濟而又最切合實用，為全美及世界各處人士所歡迎。鵬程六十號除尺寸較小以外，一切均與現代流行之一般汽車無異；而其設計打親與機構工程，並皆盡美盡善。一般車輛殆無更較鵬程為優者，至其各部機件，堅強牢固，精優卓絕，即用以裝配於較大較重之車輛上，亦殊相宜。再因鵬程之尺寸較小，故各部機件之裝配，尤為緊湊而凖確，因之共壽命加長，彌極經濟。油量之消耗減低，引擎之動作效能位增，汽油哩程則達每加侖四十二至五十六英里有奇，其經濟合算，殊不可及也。鵬程送貨車式樣且甚美觀，用以輸送貨品，並有廣告作用，堪為推進營業之助。</p>
<p>茲悉此項新車，業由本埠經售商亞爾倍路一〇一號力士汽車公司裝船運來，日內即可抵埠。該公司刻正將樣子間大加裝修，積極佈置，以為陳列新車這用。</p>

<h3>妓女政客怎及小學生</h3>
<p>— 人甬</p>
<p>前幾天本市各報我戚有吳敬恒先生底詰責精術文，吳先生底文章本來是最輕快動人的，更兼這次是義正詞嚴地詰責一個妓女政客，那自然更動人了。</p>
<p>在這篇文章底半截，吳先生一再對汪逆說：「這是連小學生也知道的！」或是說：「這是連小學生也懂得的！」這意思便是說：『你（汪）怎麼小學生還不如呢？』</p>
<p>的確，一個曾經慷慨而歌「引刀成一快，不負少年頭」的汪精衛，今日竟會昏迷至此，無怪吳稚老要說出「你怎麼小學生還不如呢」這句話來了。</p>
<p>但是事實攫在我們眼前，今日之汪精衛那裏會及得上小學生。我們不妨舉事為證：記得很久以前，報上登載着一段紀事，謂某處×軍抓住了一位咱們底小同胞，它們要他寫出「皇軍萬歲」四個字，同時在旁邊呌人用照相機把這情景攝下來。那知道這位偉人的小英雄不慌不忙，提起筆來寫了「打倒××帝國主義」一行大字。於是屠夫的尖刀刺入了小戰士火熱的胸膛，他不屈地殉國了。這雖不過是八個字，其實是過文天祥底一篇洋洋三十韻的正氣歌哩。這自然是一位小學生，這豈是汪精姨所能及其萬一！</p>
<p>我們曾看見報戰着另一個偉大的紀事：本市北區有某小學，鄰近某僞機關，某日有一羣無恥之徒去參觀，有一個教室內，全體小學生起來當了這班無恥之徒　前說：『打倒漢奸！』『打倒××！』雖然這小學校就因此不能立足，連夜遷走，停頓起來，但這場面究竟太偉大了。幾十個小喉嚨着實呌走狗膽塞，敵人驚懼！這又豈是汪精衛所能及其萬一呀！</p>
<p>瘋壓底大砲尖刀把咱們底小學生鍛鍊得與成年的戰士沒有兩樣，他們已經很懂得，誰是我們底敵人，誰是無恥的走狗？但是今日閉着眼的汪精衛，我敢斷定他一定沒有　得這樣。所以，他怎能及得上咱們這一羣清明忠勇的小學生呢？</p>
<p>所以，當大家讀了吳敬恒先生底大作，唾罵無恥的妓女政客之餘，還希望別趨視了咱們底小學生，我們要學，學學這一羣勇敢偉大的小學生！</p>
<h3>關於「最先與最後」</h3>
<p>— 吳仭之</p>
<p>—導演後的供狀—</p>
<p>星期實騐的演出，多少帶着些戲劇本位的研究姿態。當然，所謂戲劇本位的研究，決不是脫離了時代，脫離了社會，脫離了人生，而來專談戲劇的技巧。因為「沒有人生，便沒有戲劇」，我們正也不妨說：沒有時代，沒有社會，便沒有戲劇。這是戲劇的本質，我們作戲劇本位的研究，決不會忘了它的本質。這次我很榮幸，編導會議把「最先與最後」交給我導演，在我應當寫一些報告。不過，說也慚愧，不是客氣，實在的，與其說是提供研究資料，毋寗說是寫一些供狀，供給一些批判的材料。不是麼？這樣似乎比較更是確當</p>
<p>我所認識的劇旨：「最先與最後」的作者是在教育我們，使我們認識時代底，社會低法律的本質。他在這裏提出了一個例：法律在保障死屍身上的錢財，而不憐憫「為着餓纔幹出來」的一個小偷，老頭兒。仲華說：「讓我人像伯榮哥哥一樣的鐵石心腸罷。……除掉我們自已把一切都忘記罷。……這是哥哥的世界。」他的伯榮哥哥又是怎樣呢？他一再地對王小妹說：「我先和仲華打算，再和你打算。」當然，人有親疏之別。這裏，更顯示着法律根本就是那末一回事。肅伯納說得好：「你不要把法律看得和天氣的寒暖一般地自然。」「假使你不參加意見的話，他們會把你的利益分得一些都沒有。因為他們先要顧自已。」但是，終究仲華拖着小妹一同死了。他說「我們生下來就不配在這世界裏生存的。軟弱，無意志，還不生如死的好。」這是作者的聰明，他知道誰都不願意那般地死。高爾斯華綏是在教育着我們！</p>
<p>由於以上所說的做出發點我對劇　中人物的　認識是這樣：伯榮是某種統　治者的類型。而仲華便是他的最適合的對手——被統治者。王小妹在這裏，戲雖重，卻不過是悲慘的襯托而巳。</p>
<p>「最先與最後」是一個一幕三場二景的戲劇。每場都閉幕，第三場的半中間還要下一次幕（現在用「暗換」代替）。它在形式上是一個小三幕劇，而人物卻衹有三個。導演這戲，夠味是真夠味。可是難亦真難。第一場始終衹有兩人，沒有上下場，演區琮要受着光域的限制。在這裏，我最担心的是：演員地位的調動是否妥善；空氣能否始終不鬆懈。在第二·三場裏，我所最担心的是：舞台面的取景是否適當，罽床，門都要放在顯著的地位，窗要適合於取光；情緒是否夠緊；燈光，效果是否配合，因為並未全照原劇本的支配。這些，我所最担心的，並不是我所覺得滿意的，也就是我所希望就正於高明的。我們對於道威有一個感覺，要就是好，雖然好不會是絕對的；可是不好就會失敗得一塌糊塗，好似這戲不容許停留在平平的境界。因此，好是應該的，失敗是我的過逃避不了。</p>
<h3>血濺艷窟</h3>
<p>— 燕華</p>
<p>“While　New　York　Sleeps”</p>
<p>廿世紀福斯出品　國泰戲院開映</p>
<p>「血濺艷窟」在作風上，是沿着「大偵探聶克」及「霧夜飛屍案」新型偵探喜劇路綫走的，因此整個影片始終發揮着喜劇固有的特性，使觀衆在窒息緊張之中，去體味談諧，輕濟的風味，劇作者在這一點上不單很成功，就是導演人在氣氛，情感，首響效果上，都有着優越的成就，因此，雖然全片中沒有什麼光芒萬丈的紅星，但我們對「血濺艷窟」確也抱着十分愛好的。</p>
<p>這劇本的內容，和美國一般偵探片，沒有什麼兩樣。它所寫的，還是些美國夜總會中流氓，土棍及非法妄為之徒，怎樣幹着搶刧暗殺的勾當，最後破案，兇犯當然伏法。</p>
<p>以暴路性上講，這樣影片比一般劇作者專門寫些變愛色情的老調，似乎還略勝一籌，因為，它們最少是指出了在那樣社會裏，是有着這樣的人性存在著的，但劇作者視野也只擴展到這裏為止，它們無暇更進一步地指出，在這樣環境當中，不知有多少新的年青人跌信進個黑暗非法的圈子裏去，我們更應當怎樣澈底剷除這種不幸的現像。（決不是一般G-MAN　影片中，以槍殺了事）我們必須找出類人性存在的根據，及他們在這社會上活躍的因素，然後得非常教育性的，掃除他們在這金元社會中滋長蓬勃的傾向。</p>
<p>「血濺艷窟」在寫作方法上，是以幹練的新聞記者為主體的，它和「霧夜飛屍案」等片一樣，是強調地去寫這些新聞記者採訪偵察能力的高強，使警探都為之縮手的案件，但通過他靈敏，機警的偵查以後，全案是水落石出了。在這中間，還插入了一個小小的戀愛的插曲，但是本片劇作者似乎沒有落入老套，就是那位新聞記者化了很大力氣把一個涉有事大嫌疑犯的歌女救出以後，（他是以她為戀愛對像的）滿想可以和他訂婚，但她卻很著她的變人走了，對他還說些永遠不會忘記他的話，這樣關默新颕的收束，似乎比一般影片的「大團圓」收場，到有回味得多。</p>
<p>劇作者在人物性格把握上，是極成功的，寫佐意之歡喜喜護，作為後面的妹迪假作槍殺，結果真被殺，前後呼應很有力：寫佐意助手尼爾遜陰險沉默，直到最後才跳出來自認為殺人兇手，都極簡練。</p>
<p>導演者強調製造笑料一點上果然很成功，就是兩場最緊要的場面，也都沉着優越，如（一）姝迪假殺佐意一場，外面舞場的高歌狂歡，空中汽球的拋下汽球的爆裂聲，少年巴尼（即新聞記者）剛走進門口，裏面一聲槍響，推門，姝迪槍在手中，佐已倒地，但卻暗中張一眼偷視而笑；（二）破案時：衆人正檢視股票，巴尼帶攝影記者入，以槍指衆人，揶影，攝影記者退，自已出槍說殺人經過，佐意愛人在背後出槍擊尼，尼倒地，……偵探長倉惶推門入。這兩場音響效果的運用。</p>
<p>演員飾新聞記者的男主角馬格爾　倫，並不差，女角琴羅吉絲，又是一顆新星，都是很能夠演戲的。</p>

<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天美</p>
<p>第八回　是幻是真逢場作戲　宜行宜止到處為冢</p>
<p>美國怎樣的改變作風呢？因為世界的漸務實際，不專以色情奢華為誘導觀衆之計。那些女人們的大腿，看看也教人看厭了，誰個年青的女人，沒有兩條大腿。誰個年青女人的大腿，不是光光滑滑的，瞧著這些大腿，難道就可以飽了觀衆的餿眼嗎？歌舞片的唱唱跳跳，偶然看還好，倘然時常看了，換湯不換紅，老是這樣們幾套玩意兒，也不覺得有什麼意思。所以好萊塢近來以出賣女明星內體的片子，使人增加肉感的電影劇，逐漸減少了。滑稽電影片，當然還是盛行，不過滑稽是要庽有深意，要有意議的滑稽，不要無意議的滑稽。至於我們中國的電影界呢？新與事業中，電影也很發達。中央政府在國民宣傳委員會之下，有個電影局，此外各文化機關裏，也往往有電影組。其餘私家設立電影公司的很多，大槪華北在北平，華中在上海，華南在廣州，都是電影出產的大本營。但由一個政府機關審查落，不許精製濫造，卻極力提倡著關於料學的影片。我今且說東吳大學校的劇場裏，所演的電影片子，無論國外的，國內的，大槪都是科濱居多。有些是不用出錢的，特地是開映給教員學生們瞧的。有的卻是也要出錢的，因為這電影片的來源，要有一筆費用，不能不收一些兒劵價。除了開銷之外，倘有盈除，作為學校中公益之用。不但是電影為然，就是演劇，往往為了公盈的費用，也可以收一點劵價的。但這一年兩三回，或是紀念日的公演，是他們學生會中的戲劇研究會中的試演，向來不收劵費的。所演的呢？也是他們自已所編的劇本，自已所導演的新劇，而外問所不會演過的。不過那種劇本，經他們演過後，也就流傳於全國。很有別個劇團，經東吳大學的許可，而演他們的劇本。大約每一年，東吳大學必定有兩三個劇本，風行於海內外，人稱為東吳派劇本。這一次所演的劇本，名為「湘水的滬痕」，是一齣悲劇，其為五慕。是東吳大學文學院中一位教授所編的，選定了學生中幾位有演劇天才的演員，排演了一月，到今日續試演。（八六）</p>

<h3>播音閒話</h3>
<p>— （倪秋萍）</p>
<p>我開到收音機就覺得膩。接連不斷的廣告，不說是聘請專門技師，就說是科料方法製告。不管是什麼，凡是可以吃的東西，總說有維太命。時間有限，於是報告的人，像背書一般的念出來。同時播音室裏的嘈雜聲，也播了出來。這種在外國電台中是聽不到的；從前中央電台也嚴整。播票友會唱，我也常常參加。現在常有到了那邊等著擠得不得了；一會見，又沒有人唱了。這種播唱的情形太亂，我以為在時間上應有著規定。關於播的戲，也應當繁齣的播。不要唱一段追韓信，四句汾河灣，那般像唱片的唱法。前幾天的播音，為捐助難民，大家不是為聽戲，是為賑濟，似乎可以踴躍一些。對於平常廣告式的播音，不點戲是決無問題的。</p>
<p>我以前在本刊曾寫守一些彈詞小評。現在不妨再說一些：每日午後五時四十分，大亞電台有一擋魏鈺卿珍珠塔，是單擋，許久沒有聽了，似乎可以換換新鮮。比了聽嚴雪亭的唱歌，趙稼秋的京戲，誠有霄壞之別。中午十二點十分東方電台俞筱霞的玉蜻蜒，還好聽，說白亦較周玉泉等來得好。</p>
<p>一千四百週波的法國電台，很有好的音樂唱片。時間記不得了。我最喜歡聽提琴獨奏，其次是鋼琴獨奏，那些不是我們在跳舞場可以聽得到的東西。你如果愛好西樂，那麼請你試試動。</p>
<h3>仙霓社蟬聯仙樂</h3>
<p>— 禹公</p>
<p>仙霓社在仙乐出演，已于十三日打住，本報曾載其与大中華劇場簽訂合同云云。但消息傳來，又生變化，將仍在仙樂演唱，茲將經過情形、誌之如下。</p>
<p>仙樂之前台當局，為一女性，名程八妹，仙霓社在仙樂演唱，每天僅兩小時，係前後台拆賬性質，王家班話劇亦然，仙霓社期滿輟演後，王家班主持人王君達，亦因兩月來虧報過鉅，與仙樂前台解約，凖演至十七日打住，仙樂當局，旣失仙霓社，又王家班，一時無其他遊藝可以真檔，遂熟忱挽留仙霓社，且改拆賬為包賬，而仙霓社主持人，鋻於在仙樂出演以來，賓主甚為融洽，旣蒙挽留，遂即應諾，定十八日起演，王家班旣去，仙霓社乃得日夜演兩場，嗜曲者聞此消息，當亦為狂喜也。</p>
<p>又聞王家班話劇脫離仙樂後王君達將節省開支，改組班底，因知仙霓社旣蟬聯仙樂，頗矚目於大中華之場子云。</p>

<h3>張壽中之遊藝</h3>
<p>— 籌成</p>
<p>電影界鉅子張善琨之父韻笙先生，一昨舉行六旬大慶於新新酒樓時，日夜所演之平劇，由名仱名星合演，甚精彩。日場演龍鳳呈祥，自劉備招親起，至嵐化蕩三氣周瑜止，田子文女士飾劉備，無巾幗氣，王少樓君飾周瑜，臨危時做工老到；李雪枋女士之孫尚香，面上有戲；王椿柏之喬國老，忠心耿耿；其他錢麟童這趙雲，趙樵之張飛，堪稱珠聯壁合；李秀英女士之國太，王福勝之孫權，均恰合身份；故博掌聲不少。壓軸周信芳與高伯綏之興漢圖，予難因事未看，預料其必並任妙。夜場韓蘭根，程笑亭，管先靈殷秀岑四人之蕭何月下追韓信，寓荘於諧，令人笑痛肚皮，唐同顧謝晨星之珠廉寨，無瑕可擊，戴衍萬之貴妃醉酒，表情細膩，將一個因醉思春之少婦狀態，演得維妙維肖。啣杯之幾個身段，自然而勳看，難能可貴。顧蘭君與顧梅君兩姊妹，一演探親家，突梯滑稽，令人捧腹，一唱汾河灣，咬字凖確，扮相大方，可稱二難，無怪坐於台前之阿拉阿德哥，看得笑口常開。是日來賓中名仱名星佔多數，對於台上之演員，大都熟識，故演者均甚賣力，觀衆僉甚注意。汾河灣未下場，已鐘鳴子夜，予恐戒嚴而先回，致王元龍孫君豹之白馬坡，張文娟侯劍坤之老將得勝，王獻齊袁美雲岳楓之鴻　禧，毛劍秋田子文四郎探母，王少樓錢麟童李秀英之賢孝子，均未及觀，殊覺可惜，開停時已黎明矣。</p>
<h3>毛劍秋之「潘金蓮」</h3>
<p>舞國寫影</p>
<p>— 小田</p>
<h3>大華一暼</h3>
<p>上海星期六在本報上看見許多舞廳廣告，尤其是大華舞廳的，最惹人注目，把那廣告分析起來，可分為三點：第一點表的是裝璜佈置，他說富麗矞皇，如登金　殿，又說是全部龍裝，我也常常光顧大華的一位，可是龍裝還未　目，所以第二天朋友約我去跳舞的時候，就提議要去看看龍裝了。至於龍裝怎樣的好看，我想已經一星期的歷程，去過的人總看見過了，沒有去過的人，不妨去賞鋻賞鋻。第二點是說音樂，他說是當代第一流製譜聖手康脫萊拉斯，和伊勒茄（十八）　指揮的，還有柯樂大唱特唱，柯樂檙和是那位西洋胖婦，歌喉的確是很嘹亮的。第三點說舞國第一流響牌紅星茶舞候教，又說茶舞陣容硬到無可再硬，這兩句話，至的確不是吹法螺，現在且寫些我的觀感在下面：</p>
<p>昨天我又着幾位朋友光顧到大華去了，因為想着要寫一篇關於大華的記載，就請幾位朋友去數數大華有幾只舞星賓座，音樂停後，第一位朋友報告說是六十四隻，第二位報告是一邊三十七隻，還有一邊想是同數，就合成七十四隻了，於是合座譁笑，大家說，數目相差十只之多，非同小可，非得會會計師親自出馬了一位小紅星馬寶寶去查點，答數七十一隻，相應含糊落案了。</p>
<p>大華舞星最美麗的二個，一個是常州人姓胡，不記得是不是呌胡瑛，去年冬天，我同常熟梅蘭芳在那裏坐着，他指給我看，說這個人可算得鶴立雞羣，我就去請她伴舞，腳步生硬，言語未改鄉音，訝其不類此中人，詢知係鄉間小康之家，逃難來此者。伊人自云，若非一家生活所逼，決不肯操此賤業；我說，你的觀念錯了，人但能拿工作換報酬，不犯法律，不喪人格，那就是神聖職業，此着坐享的人強多了。如今這位常州朋友，表服也入時了，步法也純熟了；頭髪也燙得蓬髮卷曲了；言語也不盡屬鄉音了；可是相貌還那末漂亮，不知還記得我的幾句說話否？還有一個是楊梅妃，一個鵝蛋臉，再加上一雙似笑非笑的眼睛，你瞧該多麼耐人尋味呢。活潑天真的有三個，馬媛，馬寶寶和舒蘊蘭，她們三人，看去似乎舒蘊蘭年紀頂大，實在是她頂小，她綽號小杭州，夜舞在仙樂，還很紅的呢。马媛媛是感覺很敏的，三句話一說就會哭，一忽兒又會笑，我們送她的綽號呌癠　。馬寶寶是很溫柔的。還有李明珠，茹愛娜，胡妹妹，方莉莉，徐萃英，夜舞俱在大都會做，上回大都會雜記篇寫過了。還有個黃美琴，是我學生的朋友，也呌我先生，聽說已經會唱一齣罵殿了。林雅珍姊妹，很恬蜜，很討人喜。馬妹妹是馬媛媛的阿姊，不施鉛華，自成要格。鶯鶯和非非。都很會說風趣話，馬巧雲的活潑，比小杭州還要加一級，還有個常熟人，我在常熟居往的時候也會見過。家裏在大東門外開着舖子，的確是個小家碧玉，與常州人有同病相憐的境況，不曉得她們兩個人是否惺惺相惜吓。</p>
<h3>故都宫闈梨园秘史（一四六）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>四進士劇中的人名多是有所取意的</p>
<p>現在一般時髦人，衹知道打漁殺家是一齣打倒土豪劣紳的佳劇，於是你也說這戲負思想，我也讀揚它是適合現在潮流的名貴戲，其實上衆劣紳所倚仗的仍是些貪官污吏，而況他們所作的惡，僅僅是一鄉邑，要是從根本上講來，還是以剷除貪官污史尤為爭要。所以區區的私見，（四進士）這齣戲，不但是比「打漁殺家」更有意義，並且戲情也更為火爆，故而我要格外的捧捧它呢。這齣戲的主角宋士傑和四個進士的名字，都是有所取義的。「宋士傑」這二個字，就是「訟事傑」的諧音，本來嗎，他以一個白髪老翁，小客寓的老闆，居然能告埠一個巡案，一個道豪，一個知縣，末後雖說判了他個充軍的罪名，但是結果又被他的義女瞧出現任巡按大人就是柳林寫狀的算命先生，因此他復行轉回身來，說「告狀的罪，還沒有寫狀的罪大，狀子若無人寫，那是告不成的」。如此一來，毛巡按也恐受處分，所以才親自下堂，與他鬆綁，後來並且上本保舉他作了員外郎，這樣看來，他這人真正稱得起是位訟事之傑了。</p>
<p>這段故事的起因，是由姚田氏殺死她小叔子姚延美而起，後經延美之妾楊素貞告發，她才回到娘家怒求她的胞弟田倫，密扎求情，田進士本是一位尚未領憑上任的巡按大人，況他曾在雙塔寺與同年四人盟誓於文昌帝君之前，說道「帝君在上，弟子毛朋·田倫，覺覩·劉提，此番廉外為官，若有官長官吏過　，密扎救情，貪贜賣放，逆案准情者，各抬棺木一口，仰面還鄉。」他旣有這種設誓，當然是不會准他姊姊的請求的；不過壞在他慈母的一拜，他遂被迫而出此，方繼昧了天良，密函求情這臺逆案准情，並有壓書紋銀三百兩，一併呈上，這樣一來，就算違背襄日的誓言，後來削職為民，永不錄用，險些喪卻自已的性命。</p>

<h3>Chinese Army Adopts Flexible Strategy</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to reports received here from various lines, it is confirmed that China's regular army is currently continuing to adopt a "flexible strategy." Knowledgeable Chinese sources explain that, according to this strategy, Chinese guerrilla forces are constantly disrupting Japanese positions, attacking their thinly defended areas, and avoiding engaging their main forces. As a result, there are few casualties, and the threat to Japanese transportation and rear areas is extremely great. (14th Haitong She Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Extremely Heavy Losses for Japanese Troops in Central Hubei; Zhongxiang North and South are the Focus of the Japanese Counter-Attack; Retreat Route of Japanese Troops in Yangzi Town Cut Off</h3>
<p>Yicheng - Japanese troops in central Hubei have launched a counter-offensive against Chinese troops, suffering extremely heavy losses. Zhongxiang North and South are the focus of the Japanese counter-attack. Hand-to-hand combat between Chinese and Japanese troops in Yangzi Town, north of Zhongxiang, was extremely fierce, resulting in 500 Japanese soldiers killed and wounded. Majiaji, nearby, was occupied by Chinese troops yesterday, cutting off the retreat route of Japanese troops in Yangzi. Japanese troops south of Zhongxiang launched a counter-attack on Shagang. After contact with Chinese troops, the Japanese army was unable to withstand the attack. One part retreated to Zhongxiang, and the other part was annihilated by Chinese troops. The Japanese army's left-wing offensive and defensive operations have both been unsuccessful. It is reported that the Japanese used poison gas to kill Chinese soldiers. Chinese troops north of Ying Shan are still active in favorable positions. Five to six hundred Japanese troops from Zao City, Kaifeng, and Jingmen in Ying Shan Maping were ambushed by Chinese troops, resulting in the deaths of over 60 Japanese soldiers, including two officers. Chinese troops also seized over 50 guns and over 80 horses. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Du Ping's Commentary</p>
<h3>The Current Situation in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Although British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Daladier have jointly issued a declaration resolving to use force to guarantee the independence of Greece and Romania, Italy has not shown any restraint and is planning to divide the territories of Greece, Romania, and Bulgaria, attempting to establish a Macedonian regime and further seize the interests of Britain and France in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The Mediterranean is an inland sea surrounded by the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a vital transportation route between Britain and its colonies in India, East Africa, Australia, and the Far East. To ensure the safety of this route, Britain has not only built a large naval base on Malta and stationed a strong fleet, but also controls the eastern and western gateways of the Mediterranean: the Strait of Gibraltar and Port Said, the exit of the Suez Canal. Therefore, Gibraltar, Malta, and Port Said have become Britain's military strongholds in the Mediterranean. Not only that, but it also occupies an absolute advantage in the eastern Mediterranean: Greece is politically close to it, and Cyprus, south of Turkey, is its colony. Extending further, its influence can extend eastward through Palestine and into various parts of the Near East, such as Iraq, Persia, and Arabia on the Red Sea. In recent years, to strengthen its power in this area, it has been building strong naval and air force bases in Cyprus, Port Said, and Alexandria at the mouth of the Nile.</p>
<p>France is also an important country in the Mediterranean. The western Mediterranean is its only transportation route between the mainland and its North African colonies. Toulon, Corsica, and Bizerte are its military bases, and it has also made considerable efforts in its operations there.</p>
<p>Italy stretches across the Mediterranean like a "boot." It has a network of military bases in the central Mediterranean. After the European War, it made every effort to expand its influence in the Adriatic Sea to enhance its basis for development in the eastern and western Mediterranean. Its war against Abyssinia was the beginning of its expansion of power in the Mediterranean. After annexing Abyssinia, it actively fortified Pantelleria, located between Sicily and French Tunisia, with the aim of using it as a base for submarines and aircraft to cut off Mediterranean traffic when necessary. At the same time, it strengthened its military deployments in Libya and completed the Tobruk naval port. In this way, it can connect with the Dodecanese Islands to the northeast and consolidate the connection between Sicily and Pantelleria to the west, effectively controlling the central Mediterranean and the sea route from Malta to the Suez Canal. As a result, the communication between the French mainland and its North African colonies, as well as British influence in the eastern Mediterranean, have been threatened. Not only that, but it also colluded with Germany to launch the Spanish Civil War. After Franco's victory, it concluded a military alliance with him, stipulating that Germany and Italy would provide funds to carve out 80 square kilometers of land in the Pyrenees Mountains to establish naval and air force bases for use by Germany and Italy. More recently, it annexed Albania, dominated the Adriatic Sea, and coveted the various islands of Greece. Its influence is rapidly developing in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The rapid expansion of Italy's power is, frankly speaking, caused by Britain's policy of appeasement. Because Britain in the past did not support a system of collective security and wanted to seek security for its interests in the Mediterranean through appeasement. But the result of appeasement not only failed to stop the aggression but made the actions of the aggressors even more radical. Now, even its own interests in the Mediterranean are seriously threatened. After many setbacks, Britain has gradually awakened. This can be demonstrated by its joint declaration with France, resolving to use force to guarantee the independence of Greece and Romania and to maintain their interests in the Mediterranean. But in a situation where for every foot the righteous advance, the wicked advance ten, relying solely on diplomatic declarations without practical action is still insufficient to stop the aggression of the aggressors. Now, Italy is dreaming of the glory of the ancient Roman Empire, attempting to establish a Macedonian regime with the Mediterranean as its lake; and in the western Mediterranean, Hitler is remotely echoing this, relying on the rights conferred by his military alliance with Franco, he will send a part of the fleet into Spanish territorial waters to threaten Gibraltar. Let us see how Britain and France will maintain their interests in the Mediterranean!</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Current Situation in Xi'an Amidst the Sound of Japanese Bombing; Many Buildings in the City Destroyed; All Businesses Change to Trading at Night; Japanese Aircraft Scatter Terrorist Leaflets; Causing Deep Resentment Among the People</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) - After leaving Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi Province, for four weeks, this reporter has returned and sees that the appearance of the entire city is no longer what it was before. This reporter first visited Xi'an in early March when the city had not yet been affected by the war. The streets were crowded with people, and the shops were well-stocked with goods, with prices much lower than in Chongqing. This time, upon arrival, the reporter went to the Xi'an Guest House established by the China Travel Service, intending to book a room. The manager kindly replied, "I am very sorry, but after Japanese aircraft dropped bombs and destroyed the kitchen three days ago, we no longer offer Western food." This was the first sign of the war that this reporter encountered. Less than five minutes after returning, the familiar air raid siren sounded again, and the residents rushed towards the city walls. Shortly afterward, an emergency siren sounded loudly. Within a few minutes, two formations of Japanese bombers flying at a high altitude dropped bombs over the heart of the city. They exploded on the ground with a deafening sound. Afterward, from the burning buildings, two plumes of thick smoke rose. After the air raid, this reporter inspected the commercial area that had been bombed. What was destroyed in the buildings and shops since the previous visit made this reporter shudder. The walls of the destroyed houses and shops were spotted with shrapnel, which was everywhere. The preaching hall of the British Baptist Church was destroyed by a light bomb in this air raid. Fortunately, Bishop Douen was not in the church at the time. The next day, the house of a Chinese pastor was bombed and completely destroyed. In this air raid, the houses of the National League of Nations epidemic prevention team stationed in Xi'an were also hit by bombs, causing this disaster. On the surface, it makes a deep impression, but in reality, the destruction of the entire city must be far more than one-tenth of the total industry. The day after this reporter returned, there were 17 Japanese aircraft in the air raid, 16 of which dropped bombs, and the other scattered leaflets claiming that "China will become Bolshevistic." The leaflets were printed with crude cartoons depicting a weak Chinese person under the control of the cruel Stalin. The leaflets also urged the Chinese people to turn to their "only true friend," Japan. However, the people were unmoved by it. Their homes and livelihoods had been destroyed by bombs just minutes before, and the sadness and anger in their hearts can be imagined. How could words move them? Public morale does not seem to be affected by these air raids, because the residents are accustomed to air raids, and although they respect and stay away from them, they never feel pain because of them. At night, when everyone believes there is no danger of air raids, the whole city resumes activity. Shops open for business, the streets are crowded with people, and the restaurants are full of customers. According to the views of a certain Chinese official whom this reporter met, Japanese air raids are not so much to destroy special military targets as to be part of a general policy of terrorism. Some Chinese leaflets are distributed to Chinese people in the occupied areas, printed by lithography, with a map of China, in which all important cities are hanging Japanese flags. Other major cities, such as Chongqing, Guiyang, and Kunming, have a large bomb dropped on them, and the Chinese residents below are surrounded by smoke. A certain high-ranking Chinese military officer told this reporter that Japanese air raids on undefended cities in China have caused the people to feel deep resentment towards any actions of the Japanese army in China and are of great benefit in inspiring support for the government's resistance against Japan in the more remote provinces. Even the uneducated can understand the meaning of the bombs dropped on their hometowns. This reporter once passed through a small village in Shanxi. A Chinese person whose patriotism was superior to his knowledge of English posted English translations of Chinese slogans everywhere on the walls, stating that Japanese air raids on undefended cities are the most brutal act of mankind, and that the entire Chinese nation is fighting for the freedom, equality, and independence of its country with its own blood. The grammar may have minor flaws, but the emotions are clear. The residents of Xi'an are now busy rebuilding the bombed houses, and most of them are building with bricks instead of wooden structures. Those whose glass windows have not been shattered are protected by brick walls, with only the doors open. Xi'an now works at night. Because of the fear of air raids, all industries are trading behind closed doors, and no lights are allowed outside. Therefore, shop owners can only post notices outside the door or send people to guide customers so that they know where to go. At the same time, various official activities are now scattered in various places so that in case of an air raid, the "nerve center" of the province will not be shut down for two or three hours. The British Baptist Hospital, which was hit by two bombs on March 7, is now operating in two parts. All patients have been moved outside the city, and foreign doctors take turns on duty in the city hospital because all the equipment of the hospital cannot be moved. Although only two people were killed in the air raid on the 7th, the equipment in the hospital was greatly damaged. One of the two operating rooms, the pathology laboratory, and the X-ray room were completely destroyed, and even the microscopes were almost destroyed. According to a certain doctor, a new X-ray bulb that the hospital had been waiting for for several months had just been transported and installed. The next day, it was attacked. After the rescue work began, it was discovered that this X-ray bulb was completely intact in the rubble of the X-ray room, but the X-ray machine had been shattered. Before, there was a machine without a bulb, and now there is a bulb without a machine. (Dispatch from Reuters Special Correspondent, 13th)</p>
<h3>One Eurasian Aircraft Was Chased and Shot Down by Japanese Aircraft in the Air Bordering Yunnan and Vietnam; One German Pilot Was Slightly Injured</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Eurasian Aviation Corporation's flight No. 19 from Chongqing to Hanoi took off at 2 p.m. on the 13th.

<p>(Chongqing) One passenger plane of the Sino-German joint venture Eurasian Aviation Corporation was attacked yesterday by three Japanese fighter planes while flying from Kunming to Hanoi, French Indochina, when it flew to Lao Cai (also known as Lao Kai) on the Sino-Vietnamese border. It was eventually shot down. The German pilot, Najedang, was slightly injured. The names and conditions of other passengers have not yet been reported. (Haitong News Agency Telegraph of the 14th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Official sources here confirmed that one Eurasian Aviation Corporation passenger plane flying from Hanoi to Kunming was shot down by Japanese aircraft near Lao Cai on the Yunnan border yesterday.

The Ministry of Communications here issued a statement today, saying that one Eurasian aircraft flying from Hanoi to Kunming yesterday afternoon, when flying over the suburbs of Lao Cai near the Yunnan-Vietnam border, encountered three Japanese bombers and was subjected to intense machine gun fire. It has now been confirmed that all passengers are safe and sound, and only the pilot was slightly injured. It is believed that the three Japanese aircraft that attacked the Eurasian aircraft were part of the 19 Japanese aircraft that attacked Mengzi yesterday afternoon. (Reuters Telegraph of the 14th)</p>
<h3>Chiang Ting-wen Talks About How Japan Has Failed to Invade Xi'an, Is Now Devoting Itself to Political Education, and Has a Good Relationship With the Communist Party</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Chiang Ting-wen, Chairman of Shaanxi Province and Commander of the Tenth War Zone, told a Reuters reporter today, "I do not believe that the Japanese army intends or is able to cross the Yellow River and invade Xi'an in the near future. If the Japanese army wants to continue to advance westward in North China, its strategy will be to advance from Hankou, passing through Xiangyang. However, this route is mountainous, and the Japanese army must fight through mountains and ridges, and at the cost of outweighing the gains, capture Xi'an. We have been preparing fortifications for several months, and the Chinese army has deployed defenses layer by layer. The Japanese army cannot fly over. A foreign military expert recently visited our defense area and said to me upon his return, 'If the Japanese want to seize Xi'an, they are incredibly foolish.' Since the war has not yet extended to Shaanxi Province, the commander of Shaanxi Province often sends troops to other places to assist in the war. Shaanxi Province has sent 250,000 new recruits. We are now devoting ourselves to political education and economic development. We are currently adopting the Baojia system as a medium for conscription and promoting political education." Commander Chiang Ting-wen continued to talk about economic development, saying that this year's wheat harvest is expected to be extremely abundant, and cotton production is also considerable. It is a pity that there are not many yarn factories, so the authorities are now encouraging the use of handlooms. The prevalence of the cooperative movement in Shaanxi Province is a feature of economic development. The provincial government has issued loans of 6 million yuan to expand industrial cooperation, and local banks have also allocated 4 million yuan for their expenses. In addition, the central government has supplemented loans for textiles, soaps, and munitions, etc. Production is now increasing day by day, and transportation is also rapidly improving. In the past twelve months, 3,000 kilometers of new roads have been built, and the new railway will be completed in eight months. The required rails are taken from the Longhai Railway east of Zhengzhou. The Chinese army has demolished the Longhai Road for strategic reasons. The relationship between the National Army and the Communist Party is quite good. When asked about the special area of the Communist Party in northern Shaanxi, Commander Chiang Ting-wen replied, "Ten years of discord cannot be eliminated overnight. However, the current situation is indeed satisfactory. In the eyes of the central government, the so-called Communist Party Special Area does not exist. We believe that the current environment allows the Communist Party to exist, but we hope to make the Communist Party understand that communism cannot be applied to China. We hope that it will change its policies, but if it does not change, we have nothing to fear." (Reuters Telegraph of the 13th)</p>

<h3>The Problem of Amendment of the American Neutrality Act; Pittman Advocates Enacting New Laws on the Sino-Japanese Problem; Undersecretary of State Welles Speaks, Advocating American Aid to Invaded Countries</h3>
<p>(Washington) Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated today at the committee's discussion of the Neutrality Act amendment that he would very much like to "enact new laws" outside the Neutrality Act for the Sino-Japanese problem "in order to prevent Japan's aggression in China and Japan's discrimination against American interests." Pittman praised China's "arduous, unyielding, and historically rare spirit of hard struggle," and recognized that the current American Neutrality Act does indeed have biases and injustices in its treatment of China and Japan. However, it is difficult to legislate to be fair everywhere, so he advocated enacting new laws for the Far East in order to restore justice. According to Pittman's views, it can represent the diplomatic policy of the American government, so his attitude is very noteworthy. (American Associated Press Telegraph of the 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Pittman, the Democratic Senator who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that he agreed with the view that Japan's policies were destroying the Nine-Power Treaty. The signatories to the treaty all guaranteed to respect China's territorial integrity. At a meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee studying the Neutrality Act, Mrs. Wright, a spokesperson for ten women's groups, said that the United States possessed "terrible power," and that strict neutrality restrictions had relaxed and that the restrictions had silently colluded with the aggressor. Pittman then said that the United States could take economic measures to force Japan to end "the destruction of American rights in China." He had a clear idea of these means.

<p>Charlottesville, Virginia, USA: Today is the 196th anniversary of the birth of the late President Jefferson. It is also the 120th anniversary of the founding of the University of Virginia (founded by the late President Jefferson). The school authorities held a celebration. Undersecretary of State Welles also came to participate and gave an important speech, pointing out the crises that the current neutrality law could cause, and advocated amending it so that all countries suffering from aggression could benefit from it. He said, "If the late President Jefferson were alive, he would also see that certain national leaders are unwilling to resolve international disputes in a fair and peaceful manner, but instead want to drive millions of lives into a vortex of a world war. The horror of this war is far from comparable to the wars of the Napoleonic era. The leader of a certain great nation (referring to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini) made a statement a few days ago, saying that to maintain culture, there must be war. How can this view be accepted by the nations of the world? What is expected from the situation is that certain nations are following the orders of a few people, stepping forward to an abyss of uncertainty, and will not stop until they are completely wiped out, which is puzzling. At this time, world peace is completely indivisible. If any country uses aggression against a peace-loving nation, even if it conquers it, our country's geographical distance from it is the same, and the impact it feels is the same. In essence, if the world order is disrupted, and human principles and international relations regulations are destroyed, our country's interests will also be harmed as a result. As far as convening international conferences is concerned, all participating countries must have the sincerity to maintain peace, and there is reason to believe that all the constraints accepted by all countries will be complied with in the past, and then there is hope of success, otherwise it will be futile, why bother? The responsibility of our government lies in maintaining peace in our country, and what the people expect from the government is to strengthen defense so that it can resist foreign attacks and win victory. However, if we act in accordance with the current neutrality law, once a war breaks out abroad, the warring countries will not be able to purchase from the United States the goods necessary for their self-defense. Is this the way to maintain peace? The late President Jefferson issued a ban on the export of arms during the Anglo-French War in 1807, hoping to maintain neutrality. By 1811, he had to revoke it. Afterwards, the United States still went to war with Britain in 1812, which could not be avoided. "If Jefferson were resurrected, he would also think that maintaining neutrality could not be achieved by passing a piece of legislation. It was like this in 1807, and it is no different in 1939. Logically speaking, all countries that are at risk of being attacked, whether in peacetime or in wartime, should be allowed to purchase from our country the goods necessary for their self-defense, including military fire. This is the best way for the American people to protect peace. Conversely, if we prevent peace-loving countries (these countries do not threaten our country's security and interests) from purchasing necessary goods to prevent the aggression of other countries, it is to encourage a certain country to pursue a hegemonic policy, which is of no benefit to our country's interests and world peace." (Havas Telegraph of the 13th)</p>
<p>(New York) The Institute of Public Opinion recently conducted another public opinion test. The question was whether the current neutrality law should be amended so that the United States could supply arms to Britain and France in the event of a war in Europe. The test results showed that 57% approved and 43% opposed (Havas Telegraph of the 14th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Speech: Cooperation Among American Countries; Efforts to Promote Common Civilization; This Undertaking Has Now Been Completed</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt recently delivered a broadcast speech today, explaining the results of cooperation among the countries of the American continent in maintaining peace, as well as the future relations between the American continent and the European continent. He said roughly that the American republics have been working hard to promote common civilization under the peace system for more than half a century. This undertaking has now been completed. The countries of North and South America have formed an important cooperative group, and in a troubled world, they are in a calm state. Now the old world has become an old-fashioned duel arena again. What can we rely on to protect ourselves from the tragedy that has occurred? I think the answer to this is very simple, that is, since the countries of the Americas became free and independent countries, a novel and powerful ideal has arisen accordingly, and the governments of the countries of the Americas have gradually been united. Now, it is required that the relevant authorities of each country pursue a common goal. The Pan-American Congress is held every five years and has been carried out smoothly. However, if other parts of the world want to hold similar meetings, they must first engage in a great war, and only after the warring countries are exhausted can they convene a meeting to seek to restore their devastation. A few days ago, the highest authority of a certain great power delivered a speech, saying that the country has become a "prisoner" in the Mediterranean. A few days later, the head of another great power heard that one of its neighbors had concluded an agreement with another neighbor to defend its independence on its behalf, and pointed out that this agreement was a threat," a "siege." It is known that in the world, there has never been a precedent for a peaceful country to be surrounded, threatened, or imprisoned by other peaceful countries. According to our experience, we also firmly believe that it is impossible. When the Pan-American Peace Conference was held in the capital of Argentina in 1936, we agreed to consult each other in the event of a threat of war. Last summer, when I visited Canada, I declared that if the country was attacked, the United States would provide assistance. Last December, when the Pan-American Peace Conference was held in the capital of Peru, the countries of North and South America also issued a joint declaration, declaring that they would work together to defend the territorial integrity of each country. All of this is for the sake of defending peace, and we have no provocative concept. If others do not attack the American continent, then the above-mentioned resolutions and declarations will be useless. (To be continued) (Havas News Agency Telegraph of the 14th)</p>
<h3>Forty German Warships Went to the Atlantic for Exercises and Will Go to Spanish Ports; All Sectors in the United Kingdom Value This Greatly</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Official sources recently issued a bulletin stating that forty German warships, including two battleships, two cruisers, two destroyer flotillas totaling six ships, two submarine flotillas totaling ten ships, and twenty other auxiliary ships, are scheduled to sail from the ports of Kiel and Wilhelmshaven to the Atlantic Ocean at 6 p.m. today to conduct spring cruises, and will anchor in the ports of Spain and Portugal, the ports of Spanish Morocco, and the international neutral territory of Tangier. German fleets go to the Atlantic Ocean for spring cruises, which is a traditional practice, but it has been interrupted since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. There is no other intention in restoring it now. As far as those familiar with the news know, German warships will cruise in the Atlantic Ocean and will not enter the Mediterranean Sea. (Havas Telegraph of the 14th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Official sources here said that the German naval spring exercises will be held in the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast of Spain, but Reuters learned that one or two ships may enter the Mediterranean Sea at that time. (Reuters Telegraph of the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Official sources recently announced that the German government has notified the governments of the United Kingdom and France that the country's naval spring exercises this year will be held on the sea off Spain for a period of one month. The participants in the exercises include three "Deutschland-class" cruisers, submarines and auxiliary ships, which will sail from their bases to West Country on the 18th of this month. Naval figures here recently commented that if naval fleets of various countries are greatly mobilized, they must notify each other. This is an international practice. The competent authorities here said that at a time when the situation in Europe is serious, Germany's move has great significance both politically and militarily. It has recently been rumored that when Spain joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, an annex was signed allowing Germany to use the country's naval bases. Judging from this incident, it seems to be credible. Although it is inconvenient to make a judgment on the future impact, it should be closely watched. As far as the defense of the British port of Gibraltar is concerned, the government has recently taken special technical measures to renovate the Jin Cheng Tangchi, which is extremely solid. We are not afraid of attacks from the sea or from the land. (Havas Telegraph of the 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The matter of forty German warships going to cruise on the sea off Spain was recently commented on by diplomatic figures here, who said roughly that Germany's intention was to threaten General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish National Army, to make the National Army government more subservient to the military alliance treaty after joining the Anti-Comintern Pact, or at least want the National Army government to agree to threaten the traffic lines on the Atlantic Ocean in wartime. This attempt is indeed fraught with crises, but experts believe that, apart from submarines, German warships cannot actually do much even if they use the ports of the West Country. If General Franco openly sides with Germany, Italy and Er in the future, if a war breaks out, the German warships anchored in the ports of the West Country will be immediately blockaded by the British and French fleets, making it impossible for them to cross the minefield. In essence, German warships will find it very difficult to compete with the British fleet. At most, they will only attack the traffic lines for transporting food to Britain and France in wartime.

<h3>Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Army in West Country Postpones Entry into Madrid</h3>
<p>Burgos: General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the National Army, was originally scheduled to enter Madrid on the 2nd of next month in a triumphant ceremony. It is now heard that the date has been changed again, and the date has not been determined. It is generally believed that the date will be postponed to the 15th of next month. It is said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has provided assurances to the United Kingdom, stating that the country's volunteer soldiers will return to their country immediately after General Franco enters Madrid.

<h3>British Engineering Teams Deploy Defenses North of Gibraltar; There Are Also Military Operations Within the Spanish Border</h3>
<p>Gibraltar: More than 100 British engineers are currently engaged in building obstacles on the main road north of Gibraltar. Cars and buses are not allowed to enter or leave the fortress area after sunset. This is a precautionary plan. Since April 8, there have been military activities in Algeciras, Spain, and other Spanish places connected to Gibraltar. Every day, we see ground artillery and tanks being transported to the Spanish city of La Lina, and hundreds of Italian soldiers have arrived there. (Reuters Telegraph of the 14th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar: The port of La Linea in southern Spain (adjacent to the port of Gibraltar) has been under strict guard for days, and a large amount of military fire has been transported from the port of Cadiz, including field artillery, machine guns, tanks, and ammunition. There are also two to three thousand National Army troops who have been arriving there since the 11th of this month, most of them stationed in the bullring. Residents there who came to this port all expressed their unease about this move. In addition, many large transport ships have recently been traveling between the ports of Ceuta and Melilla in Spanish Morocco in North Africa and Algiers in southern Spain. (Havas Telegraph of the 13th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar: After the Spanish National Army government concentrated troops in the vicinity of this port, the military authorities here have also taken appropriate precautions to be vigilant. Two hundred sappers have been working overnight to build solid obstacles on the northern highway 200 meters from the British-Spanish border. It is heard that the authorities of the Spanish port of La Linea have ordered the requisition of all kinds of vehicles in the city. (Havas Telegraph of the 13th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar: The army attache and naval attache of the French Embassy in Spain arrived here this afternoon from the Spanish city of Burgos. (Havas Telegraph of the 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Political figures here recently declared that it is disturbing to feel that Spain may once again become the center of international incidents at this time. Although the Italian government has provided assurances to the United Kingdom, stating that it is willing to withdraw volunteer soldiers from Spain as soon as possible, the information received here is to the contrary. For example, the Spanish National Army government has taken military measures near the British port of Gibraltar and in Spanish Morocco, one; one-third of the German fleet has sailed to the sea off Spain, two; German newspapers have suddenly advocated that Spain's position is very important, three; foreign troops and ordnance continue to arrive at the port of Cadiz in southern Spain, four; although the Spanish National Army government has issued daily communiqués denying this, the news that comes is often contrary to this communiqué. Since the National Army government joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, German newspapers have taken the opportunity to exaggerate their wishes for Spain. It is estimated that the recent developments in Spain are a response by certain countries to the security of Greece and Romania guaranteed by the United Kingdom and France, with the obvious purpose of planning ahead and seeking a base in wartime. The United Kingdom and France should pay close attention to it. (Havas Telegraph of the 13th)</p>
<h3>Fascist Party of Italy Approves Annexation of Albania</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Albanian National Assembly yesterday resolved to offer the Albanian crown to Victor Emmanuel III, King of Italy and Emperor of Abyssinia. The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party, meeting at 10 PM tonight, concluded after twenty-five minutes and immediately approved the acceptance. Afterwards, Party Secretary Starace read a public statement to over forty thousand citizens, stating briefly: 1. The Italian and Albanian nations, based on generations of friendship, have established a deeper and more certain relationship. The Supreme Fascist Council welcomes this historical event with a heroic attitude. Fascist Italy, with its strong soldiers and sharp weapons, will surely protect the brave Albanian nation, respect its religious beliefs, and lay the foundation for civil progress and social justice to achieve peace. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) After the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party adjourned, Prime Minister Mussolini addressed the crowd, saying that the historical events that have occurred in recent days are the result of our will, confidence, and strength. We will treat those who treat us with friendship with a friendly attitude, and we will respond to those who are hostile to us with a clear and resolute hostile attitude. The crowd then shouted various slogans such as "Down with France", "March on Paris", "Tunisia", and "Corsica". The Prime Minister then continued, "We are carrying out great work every day. We hope that the countries of the world will not interfere. We only know how to move forward and never look back. This has been the case in the past, and it will be the case in the future. This is what all countries in the world should understand." (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Fascist Professional Association Parliament is scheduled to formally convene tomorrow to approve the title of King of Albania to King Victor Emmanuel III. At that time, the Albanian delegation will also attend and present the crown to the King. Foreign Minister Ciano will also deliver an important speech explaining the situation in Europe.

<h3>German and Italian Policies Unaffected After Anglo-French Declaration, Poland, Greece and Romania Express Welcome, British Newspapers Mostly Disappointed with Inadequate Appeasement</h3>
<p>(London) Rome and Berlin's initial reaction to British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons today suggests that both Italy and Germany remain steadfast and without regrets. Upon receiving news of Britain's guarantee of assistance to Romania, the people of Rome were overjoyed, and officials expressed their gratification. Everywhere, cries of "brave" were heard. The Hungarian view is that the British Prime Minister's remarks neither reduced nor increased the severity of the international situation, and they felt that the situation remained quite serious, with everything depending on the subsequent actions of Italy and Germany. German officials will not issue criticisms until they have carefully studied the full text of the British Prime Minister's remarks. However, foreign news agencies published an officially authorized declaration condemning many points in the British Prime Minister's statement and severely criticizing British propaganda methods. Italian political circles, based on brief reports of the British Prime Minister's remarks, expressed the opinion that the British Prime Minister's words, properly interpreted, acknowledged that Italy's occupation of Albania did not violate the Anglo-Italian Agreement and made the same observation regarding the situation in the Mediterranean. They expressed doubts about Britain's ability to implement its guarantees to Romania and Greece, as well as about Britain's guarantees to Poland. They also believed that Italy's guarantee to Greece made Britain's guarantee to that country superfluous. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) After Britain and France simultaneously gave guarantees to Greece and Romania, diplomatic circles here have stated that these unilateral guarantees may be converted into mutual assistance agreements, but this is not important at present. Britain, France, Greece, and Romania have thus united, and the ongoing negotiations between the related countries can now focus on Turkey alone, and the mutual assistance agreement signed between Greece and Romania can be extended to other countries in the Balkan Peninsula. In practical terms, the guarantees given by Britain and France to Romania depend on whether British and French warships can freely pass through the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits of Turkey, which is why Britain and France are eager to reach an agreement with Turkey. As for Bulgaria, it has desires regarding Romania's Dobruja province (which originally belonged to Bulgaria), and therefore remains resentful. Although the British government cannot force Romania to reach an agreement with Bulgaria, Turkey, which maintains friendly relations with both countries, is expected to mediate. In addition, some countries in the Balkan Peninsula remain wary of the Soviet Union. The British government now intends to advise these countries to sign sky agreements with the Soviet Union, without establishing general mutual assistance agreements, in order to avoid the possibility of Soviet troops passing through these countries. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) Although all newspapers praised Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration yesterday, conservative newspapers still felt that the government's actions were slow and insufficient. Left-wing newspapers said that Prime Minister Chamberlain only briefly mentioned the Soviet Union when answering questions from opposition parties. The newspapers also welcomed the declaration made by French Prime Minister Daladier and said that the British government's provision of guarantees to Romania was insisted upon by France, so this decision was made only at the last moment. The Labour Party's Daily Herald reported that "the government is considering various emergency measures. Once these measures are put into practice, it will be necessary to convene all the countries concerned, including the Soviet Union, to hold a meeting. The true defensive front of peace-loving countries, working together, will be realized in a timely manner." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Political figures here have expressed satisfaction with the declarations made by the British and French leaders yesterday, saying that the resolute attitude of the leaders of the two major democratic governments is proof that the era of concessions symbolized by the Munich Agreement has indeed ended, and that there is hope for the establishment of "true peace". The US government also took this opportunity to emphasize that the US, Britain, and France all have the responsibility to contain aggression, showing that their ideals are consistent. The newspapers also added favorable comments, saying that Britain and France have decided to reorganize the collective security system. The Democratic New York Times reported, "If Britain and France can truly ally with the Soviet Union to assist small countries, the new collective security system will be strengthened. Looking back at the US Congress, it should promptly revise the Neutrality Act to help the democratic countries of Europe. "The Republican New York Herald Tribune, speaking of the lack of sincerity of the dictators, stated, "The promises provided by Italy are worthless, and no different from the promises provided by its partner, National Socialism. Looking ahead, the establishment of peace in Europe is a long way off. As for whether it can survive for the time being, it also depends on whether the German-Italian axis can temporarily stop its activities." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Diplomatic circles here attach great importance to the fact that Britain and France have given guarantees to Romania, saying that the Romanian government was deeply afraid that Germany would use the establishment of a mutual assistance agreement with Britain and France as an excuse to take action. Therefore, Britain and France gave Romania unilateral guarantees before its Foreign Minister Gafencu went to Berlin to strengthen its position. This is a worthwhile thing to do. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the British Prime Minister Chamberlain's announcement in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon that Britain had provided unilateral assistance guarantees to Romania and Greece, political figures here believe that Britain is continuing to pursue a policy of encircling Germany. German political figures pointed out that Germany and Romania already had an economic agreement in place, and Italy and Greece had exchanged notes, so the motivation for Britain's guarantee was not out of a love of peace, but based on Britain's military interests. It has been more than a day since Britain sought naval bases in the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea. If a war were to break out, Greece would conclude an agreement with Britain to provide the above naval bases for use. This is the old trick of the Allied Powers forcing Greece to join World War I. In 1915, after British and French troops landed in Salonika, Greece still refused to participate in the war. Thereupon, the Allied Powers announced a blockade and occupied the ports of Athens and Piraeus. King Constantine was forced to abdicate, and the Greek army was disarmed. Then Greece participated in the Allied forces in the war. From this point of view, Greece's acceptance of the guarantee this time is probably considered better than being forced to comply, thereby avoiding a second British "aggression." (Haitong dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>The Romanian capital's newspapers attached great importance to the declaration issued by the British and French leaders guaranteeing Romania and Greece. The newspaper Universul stated that "to this day, Britain and France have accepted military constraints, thereby establishing a collective security system to resist aggressive policies. This move is purely defensive and has no provocative or aggressive implications. Since our country's policy is to maintain its territorial integrity and sovereign independence, there is no reason to refuse such unilateral guarantees from Britain and France. "The newspaper Timpul stated that "the fact that the British and French leaders automatically gave guarantees to our country is a sign of friendship and can only be strengthened by this increased guarantee." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: After French Prime Minister Daladier delivered a speech yesterday, advocating for the strengthening of the Franco-Polish alliance treaty, the newspapers here unanimously praised it, saying that the European balance of power could be restored and the hope for peace could be increased. The Warsaw Daily reported that "the possibility of Western European countries maintaining peace has not been completely lost, but it has been decided to fight when necessary. This can be seen in the defense preparations made by Britain and France. The diplomatic policies pursued by Western European countries will certainly achieve great success. In short, after the establishment of a large-scale consultation system, the days when aggressors go unpunished will certainly not be seen again today." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Britain Seeks Soviet Participation in Anti-Aggression Front, Plans to Offer Guarantees to Turkey, and Make Poland Also Guarantee Romania</h3>
<p>(London) According to a Reuters reporter, although it was generally expected beforehand that Britain and France would immediately guarantee Greece against aggression, it was thought that the same guarantee might not be given to Romania at this time. It is now learned that British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Daladier, after lengthy discussions over the past 24 hours, made the decision to also give guarantees to Romania. It should also be noted that Britain and France's guarantees to Greece and Romania are unilateral actions. Britain now expects Poland to join in guaranteeing Romania and is conducting discussions with Warsaw in this regard. At the same time, Britain is also conducting friendly and frank discussions with Turkey. When the negotiations are completed, Britain will issue a statement expressing Britain's attitude towards Turkey if Turkey is attacked. As for Bulgaria, although there are various difficulties, it is possible that it will eventually join the group of powers. If any country that joins is attacked by Germany or Italy, the other countries will provide assistance. It is heard that the question of how the Soviet Union will participate in the guarantee organization is now receiving close attention. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Speaks</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax spoke in the House of Lords today, using the same wording as Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons. He said that if the independence of Greece and Romania is threatened and resistance is deemed necessary, Britain will use all its strength to assist. The British government has notified this declaration to the governments directly concerned and other governments, especially Turkey, because the close relationship between Turkey and Greece is well known to the world. He said that France had also issued the same declaration. In mentioning the withdrawal of Italian troops from Spain, he said that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano had told British Ambassador to Italy Sir Percy Loraine on April 9 that when the Italian troops in Spain withdrew, Italian planes and pilots would also leave. Lord Snell, representing the Labour Party, and Lord Lothian, representing the Liberal Party, then spoke in succession, urging Britain to ally with the Soviet Union, saying that this was absolutely essential. When Halifax mentioned the Soviet Union in responding to the debate, he solemnly stated that the British government must deal with all the real difficulties that it did not create, and said that during these weeks of concern, he had made every effort to inform the Soviet Ambassador Maisky of the government's views and had paid due attention to trust in other areas. All these difficulties may also be felt by other countries. Halifax also assured the House of Lords that the government's intention was nothing other than to resolutely unite all those who could respect international relations and matters related to us that needed to be guaranteed to the best of its ability to eliminate various difficulties. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>British Opposition Expresses Disappointment</h3>
<p>(London) After Prime Minister Chamberlain made a declaration in the House of Commons this afternoon, Opposition Labour Party leader Major Attlee spoke after him, expressing disappointment. He said, "Prime Minister Mussolini has deliberately violated the obligations he accepted in the Anglo-Italian Agreement. British policy should no longer be based on this agreement. What we ask for is the implementation of a genuine guarantee policy, not for a week or half a month, but to establish a lasting collective security system. It is a pity that the Prime Minister did not say a word about the Soviet Union's position. How can we establish a collective security system without Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as the axis, thereby uniting all peace-loving forces around this axis? In short, if the government is unwilling to take resolute measures, it will be easier to begin with." Opposition Liberal Party leader Sinclair then spoke, also saying that it was necessary for Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to establish a close and resolute cooperative relationship, but it was a pity that the Prime Minister did not say a word about the Soviet Union. For the present plan, our country must reorganize the cabinet. "Former Foreign Secretary Eden and former Chancellor of the Exchequer Churchill were full of sacrifice and were able to adhere to sound and unpopular principles. If they could serve as Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer, the British people would receive great encouragement in this dark age. In addition, the cabinet should add a Ministry of Munitions. After guaranteeing the security of various countries in Europe, if we cannot follow up with aircraft, ammunition, and troops in addition to warships in the event of war, then guarantees are nothing but empty words." (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) At the House of Commons meeting yesterday afternoon, Opposition Labour Party MP Dalton gave a speech, strongly stating that with regard to the collective security organization, Britain should invite the Soviet Union to participate or sponsor it, but he did not know whether the government had made a proposal to the Soviet government and wanted to hear the details. Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon immediately replied that the government had invited the Soviet Union to sponsor the new policy at the beginning of its implementation, and that the government had maintained the closest contact with the Soviet government throughout the negotiations with the countries concerned, "Because where else can we obtain assistance? The matter is very clear. If we cannot understand this, wouldn't we be extremely foolish? In short, we have absolutely no intention of excluding the Soviet Union. We are fully aware of the contribution that the Soviet Union can make to maintaining peace." Therefore, the government does not oppose any proposal that advocates a military alliance treaty with that country. Political figures here attached great importance to the Chancellor of the Exchequer's remarks, saying that Sir Cadogan, a high-ranking official of the Foreign Office, had been in close contact with him before the Chancellor of the Exchequer spoke, so the Chancellor of the Exchequer's wording was very precise. Sir Seeds visited Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov this morning to explain Britain's intentions and inquire about the Soviet Union's true intentions. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Chamberlain's Declaration Full Text</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered his policy on the international situation to the House of Commons this afternoon after the Easter recess resumed its session. He first addressed the Albanian incident, saying it was difficult to obtain information about Albania. Foreign Secretary Halifax is still awaiting information from the British envoy stationed in Albania. As for the news coming from Italy-Albania, it is contradictory and should be left until the truth of the incident is known before making a judgment. Italy's actions have deeply shocked the world. As far as Britain is concerned, we must ask ourselves how the Albanian incident can be consistent with the Anglo-Italian Agreement. The Prime Minister then quoted the preamble of the agreement, continuing, "I dare to say that Britain and the world both feel that Italy's actions in Albania not only fail to contribute to general peace and security but will also cause continued disturbances and increase international tension." As for the current situation stipulated in the agreement, British Ambassador to Italy, Percy, and Foreign Secretary Halifax, concerned about this point, have stated that the overall situation will seriously involve the entire issue of maintaining the current situation. Maintaining the current situation is one of the important factors in the Anglo-Italian Agreement. The Adriatic Sea is indeed part of the Mediterranean Sea, and the Italian government cannot hastily claim that Britain has nothing to do with it." The Prime Minister recalled that on April 7, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano still claimed that the Italian government intended to respect Albania's independence and integrity, and the status quo in the Mediterranean. On April 9, the British government notified the Italian government that Britain was paying close attention to this and other guarantees but was deeply worried after receiving the news of the sudden Italian military invasion of Albania. If the situation between Italy and Albania was as described by the Italian Foreign Minister, then it was unbelievable that disputes could not be resolved through negotiations. Furthermore, we are even more puzzled as to how the Italian military's landing in Albania can be consistent with the promise to maintain Albania's independence and integrity. Percy told the Italian Foreign Minister that Britain felt that a very clear and full explanation of Italy's intentions regarding the situation in Albania should be obtained to dispel doubts. The explanations the British government has received to date have caused it deep concern and cannot satisfy British public opinion. The Italian Foreign Minister, pressed by Percy, stated that Italy's future intentions would depend on the wishes of the Albanian people. According to recent news, the Albanian provincial government has offered the Albanian King to the Italian King. We must now wait for the Italian government to provide its confirmation of this. Regardless of the outcome, the British government feels that Albania's situation is extremely difficult to reconcile with what was contemplated in the Anglo-Italian Agreement. This not only puts Albania's future in danger, (cheers from the audience) but also causes unrest among all regions bordering Albania and other countries bordering the Mediterranean or in the Balkan Peninsula. The Prime Minister did not want to elaborate in detail to disturb the House of Commons but wanted to present evidence of this fact. On April 11, Italian Chargé d'Affaires in Britain, Colonna, visited Foreign Secretary Halifax and informed him of the matters. During this meeting, the British Foreign Secretary told the Chargé d'Affaires that the British government had no intention of occupying Corfu but would take a very serious view if another country occupied it (cheers from the audience). Subsequently, the British Minister to Greece reported that the Greek government had received information that Italy intended to occupy Corfu in the near future. This information was later confirmed by the Greek Minister to Britain. The British Foreign Secretary then informed the Italian Chargé d'Affaires of this news. The Italian Chargé d'Affaires said that he dared to assert that this news was absolutely untrue and was willing to guarantee that this was not the policy of the Italian government. The British Foreign Secretary, while welcoming this guarantee, stated that there should be no misunderstanding between the two governments on this point. This was absolutely essential. On the same day, the Italian Chargé d'Affaires received a letter from Mussolini reaffirming that Italy intended to respect Greece's territorial integrity to the British Foreign Office. (cheers from the audience) I have said several times before that once trust is shaken, it is not easy to restore it. The British government now feels that it is its inescapable duty to ensure that there is no doubt in people's minds about its position. Therefore, I take this opportunity to declare that the British government considers it extremely important to avoid the disturbance of the status quo in the Mediterranean and the Balkan Peninsula by force or the threat of force. The government has therefore decided that in the event of any clear action endangering the independence of Greece or Romania, and if the Greek or Romanian government deems it necessary to resist with its national force, the British government will immediately assist the Greek and Romanian governments with all its strength. (cheers from the audience) We are now communicating this declaration to the governments directly concerned and other governments. I know that the French government is also making a similar declaration. I have one or two more views to inform the House of Commons. As far as I am concerned, the British government's policy of signing the Anglo-Italian Agreement a year ago was quite correct, and no event has made me change this belief. (cheers from the audience) I am doing this not to provoke disputes but to avoid misunderstandings about my attitude today. I am extremely disappointed with Italy's actions in Albania. Today, some will naturally argue that we should declare the Anglo-Italian Agreement null and void, but I do not hold this view. Even today, no one seems willing to take responsibility for doing anything that would increase international tension. Therefore, I believe the general desire is to see the provisions of the agreement fulfilled. In light of recent events, the Italian government must, of course, provide us with the practical evidence we expect, showing that Italy shares this desire. The Prime Minister continued that during recent exchanges of views, the Italian government had told the British government that the Italian troops in Spain would be withdrawn after the victory parade in Madrid. The British government had taken note of this and new assurances and had always regarded the withdrawal of Italian volunteers from Spain as a crucial factor in the Anglo-Italian Agreement. We have been patient for a long time. Although our efforts to eliminate misunderstandings, promote goodwill, and maintain peace have been hampered by many obstacles, I firmly believe that these efforts will eventually bear fruit. The Prime Minister then declared that he had not mentioned the Soviet Union not because he had not maintained close contact with the Soviet representative regarding the situation but out of respect for the wishes of other peoples. We must insist on making concessions so that we are not only capable of defending ourselves but also able to fulfill our duty to assist those countries that encounter aggression or are in danger of losing their freedom and decide to resist. When the Prime Minister spoke, the ambassadors of China, Belgium, the Soviet Union, Poland, France, and Brazil, the ministers of Romania, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Greece, Albania, Turkey, Finland, and Peru, the commissioners of Canada, South Africa, and Ireland stationed in London were in the audience. The Duke of Kent was in the House of Lords. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Civil War Deaths and Injuries Total 1.2 Million</h3>
<p>Madrid Since the outbreak of the civil war in July 1936, the number of deaths and injuries is said to be as high as 1.2 million. Among them, about 450,000 are soldiers, and about 750,000 civilians were executed or died in artillery fire. As for the Nationalist forces, due to their superior weaponry, the number of deaths and injuries is only more than 130,000. (Havas dispatch from the 14th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Invade Jiangmen; Chinese Troops Launch Three-Pronged Counterattack; Japanese Army Suffers Heaviest Losses Since Invading Guangdong; Attempt to Land in Taishan by Sending Warships Fails</h3>
<p>Hong Kong dispatch: Although the Guangzhou Japanese army has been repeatedly reinforced recently, the reinforcements, having just arrived on transport ships from the south, are then distributed to various locations. Recently, two regiments were divided, invading Xinhui and Heshan by land and water. Those taking the land route mostly advanced from Foshan, Jiujiang, and Shunde to invade the Jiangmen line. Those invading the Jiangmen line mostly concentrated at Zhutoushan by ship from Huangpu, then landed from Beijie to attempt to seize the Ningyang Railway. The battles near Xinhui City have been fierce for days. Jiangmen has undergone several seesaw battles. Since Beijie in Jiangmen has no defenses, even if the Chinese army captures Jiangmen, strategically, it must be abandoned again. The complete recovery of Jiangmen and Xinhui City can only be achieved after the Japanese army's maritime reinforcements are cut off. Therefore, the current battle in Xinhui depends on the transfer of military situation in the east, west, and north of Guangzhou. The Chinese army is currently adopting a strategy of "besieging Wei to rescue Zhao," taking advantage of the Japanese army's attempt to seize Xinhui and the Ningyang Railway, and launching a sudden counterattack on the northeast, west three rivers. In recent days, progress has been quite rapid. It is estimated that the eastern Chinese army, starting from the third day, attacked Zengcheng from Pingfengling, Zhaiding, and Hululing, and successively captured Lizhiao and Longhuzhai. The Japanese army in Zengcheng has been surrounded. The Northern Guangdong army, on the 6th day at dawn, attacked the Xinji Station in the southern section of the Canton-Hankow Railway. The station had strong Japanese fortifications, which were bombed by Chinese aircraft in advance, followed by an infantry assault, recapturing the strongholds between Xinji and Huaxian. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese army advanced steadily. On the evening of the 6th, they once stormed Jiangcun. Jiangcun is only tens of miles away from the northwest suburbs of Guangzhou. Guangzhou citizens faintly heard artillery fire. The Japanese army in Guangzhou hurriedly dispatched reinforcements and densely shelled Jiangcun, while the Japanese army from Huaxian outflanked the northeast of Huaxian. For strategic considerations, the Chinese army temporarily withdrew from Jiangcun that night to attack the Japanese army in the northeast of Huaxian with all its strength. The Japanese army eventually retreated to Longkouzhuang. Also, Shijiaoxu and Yangcun, south of Huaxian, were all recovered by the Chinese army. As for the Guangdong army on the west river front, they launched simultaneous attacks on the evening of the 5th. The Japanese army responded in a panic. On the 6th, they finally could not hold on. Makou, Rongkou, Yangmei, and the old Sanshui County seat were successively recovered by the Guangdong army. Guanyao in Sanjiang, Nanhai County, which is located at the hub of the northwest rivers, usually had six to seven hundred Japanese troops. That night, more than half of them were wiped out by the Guangdong army. Since the Japanese army entered Guangdong, the above-mentioned several battles have been the most severe losses suffered.</p>
<p>The Japanese army, which has been invading Xinhui for days, has not only made no progress, but also suffered from the failure of the Japanese army in the east, west, and north rivers. Most of them have no intention of fighting. The hardware products looted from Jiangmen and Xinhui a few days ago were moved away by ships. In addition to the raw materials for hardware, there were also five to six hundred Japanese soldiers killed, all of which were transported by boat from Beijie to the cremation area for cremation. Since Jiangmen was subjected to war, many shops have been destroyed by bombing, and those that still exist have either been looted or closed. Jiangmen Inner River is a waterway that must be passed through by the five counties. At this moment, due to military relations, the land routes from Jiangmen to Heshan or from Xinhui to Taishan Kaiping have been destroyed. Refugees from Xinhui are now fleeing to Lilexu in the southwest of Jiangmen, and then from Lilexu to Zhongshan County, and then from Zhongshan to Macau by land. If they go to Siyi from Macau without passing through Jiangmen, they can only follow the waterway to Sanjiang Longshuikou in Xinzeng, and then follow the land to Gongyibu in Taishan. The Japanese army believes that the coastline of Taishan is very long, and giant ships can berth near Shangchuan and Xiachuan Islands. Recently, they plan to land in Guanghai to contain the Guangdong army aiding Jiangmen from Siyi. In recent days, more than 20 Japanese warships, more than 10 rubber boats, and six or seven speedboats were suddenly anchored on the sea surface at the junction of Chixi and Taishan counties. About five to six hundred Japanese marines on board the ships sent more than a hundred soldiers on the evening of the 5th of the month, riding speedboats and armored fishing boats to the coast of Guanghai, attempting to sneak across. At the same time, Japanese warships fired artillery at the shore. On the afternoon of the 6th, the second invasion occurred. Hundreds of Japanese soldiers, under the cover of naval artillery fire, rushed to the coast of Guanghai Shadi. At first, the local national team maintained a tight guard. When the Japanese soldiers approached the shore, they fired a barrage of artillery fire. After about an hour of standoff, the Japanese soldiers, knowing that China was prepared, took boats and retreated. At this moment, the local defense army has destroyed the coastal highway to prevent the Japanese army from landing and attacking Siyi. (April 8)</p>
<h3>Situation After the Fall of Wuhan (Continued) - Talks by Returnees from Wuhan</h3>
<p>Japanese Soldiers are Lewd and Weary of War</p>
<p>The enemy has established many brothels in Hankou to comfort the imperial army. Each prostitute has to have relations with more than 40 Japanese soldiers every day. Japanese soldiers line up to go to the brothels every day, and each person holds a wooden token. The prostitute then collects the wooden tokens and goes to the Japanese military camp to collect money. In addition, incidents of rape and shooting occur frequently every day.</p>
<p>The airport in Hankou is two or three times larger than before, and enemy planes are often parked there. Their military supplies are mostly placed along the riverbank, but they are often moved. According to the porters, the ammunition boxes are very light, and so are the oil tanks. I don't know why.</p>
<p>Shenjiamiao and Hanzheng Street are designated as refugee areas. The food supply in the refugee area is often not up to date. The refugee area in Wuchang is the Wenhua University. Some refugees have run out of food. Bishop Meng of Huazhong University distributed rice to the refugee area, saying to the refugees, "This rice is not distributed by us, but was left to you by your chairman when he withdrew from Wuhan. He instructed me to distribute it to you now. You must never forget your chairman." The refugees were very moved when they heard this.</p>
<p>From many places, we can see the anti-war situation of the enemy army. Once, a Japanese military policeman in the refugee area said to a few refugees, "If you want to die, you die ten minutes before us. Now you are surrounded by three circles." As he spoke, he drew three circles with his hands. The first circle indicated the refugees, the second circle indicated the Japanese army, and the outer big circle indicated the encirclement of our army. As he spoke, he wiped a gap in the second circle with his hand, saying, "We will die here in the future." In addition, Japanese soldiers often asked the refugees, "Do you have a wife? Do you have children? Do you have parents?" They took out photos of their wives to show everyone. They all knew that they were sent to Central China to fight and had no hope of returning.</p>
<p>The Ugly Types of Traitors are Revealed</p>
<p>What makes us sad and indignant is that on the New Year's Day of the lunar calendar, a child was brutally killed by Japanese soldiers for singing the "March of the Volunteers" on the street. Again, on the day the maintenance association was established, Japanese soldiers distributed five-color flags and sun flags on the street to celebrate. A group of children, moved by patriotic indignation, broke the paper flags. After being discovered by Japanese soldiers, they were also brutally murdered.</p>
<p>A week after the Japanese army invaded Wuhan, a "Wuhan News" was published, which was the enemy's propaganda newspaper. There is also an irregular newspaper that is often found on the market, called "Li News." The content inside is aimed at the Wuhan News. No one knows where the Li News is published. There is also something that excites us: some children who sell newspapers, when they meet Japanese soldiers, shout, "Wuhan News, Wuhan News," but when they enter the concession gate, they jump up and shout, "The Central Army has surrounded the Wuhan newspaper, the guerrillas have entered the Wuhan... newspaper." From this, we know how much the refugees in the occupied areas are looking forward to us fighting back. Several times when our planes bombed the South Lake Airport in Wuchang, Xujiazha, and Luojia Mountain, the compatriots said, "As long as we see our planes come to bomb, we are willing to be bombed to death." From this, we can see that the sons and daughters of our Chinese nation will never surrender to the enemy.</p>
<p>The current traitor organizations and responsible persons of the maintenance association in Wuhan are mostly people who used to be active in the Wuhan business community. The manager of the game hall is the chairman of the maintenance association. People like Yang Huiting, Li Ding'an, and Jin Longzhang are all important responsible figures of the maintenance association. There is also an "Association of Students Returned from Japan," which is also the most powerful traitor organization. What we need to pay attention to is that some of the people who used to do salvation work in Wuhan have now become traitors. This is something that we must pay the most attention to in the future.

<h3>Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce Criticizes Japanese Methods of Oppressing Foreign Businesses; Marshall Lists the Facts to Prove Japanese Discrimination Against Third-Country Nationals</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that Sir Marshall, Chairman of the Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce, delivered a speech at the Chamber's annual meeting last night (the 13th), strongly denouncing Japan's oppressive measures against foreign businesses in the occupied areas, saying that "military needs" or consideration for the welfare of foreign shipping cannot now be recognized as valid reasons for blockading the Yangtze River and prohibiting foreign merchant ships from navigating. Other significant observations made by Marshall were: (1) Regulations promulgated by Japan due to military actions, such as those implemented in Qingdao and the Yangtze River, discriminate against third-country nationals; (2) Although protests have been lodged, it seems that Japan has not yet understood its obligations to third-country nationals; (3) Trade with various ports along the Yangtze River estuary has proceeded normally, but Japan has recently used commercially rare means to deprive British ships of trade; (4) Japan, while claiming that it earnestly hopes to revive its invaded areas, refuses to return privately-owned factories to their legitimate owners; (5) The "North China Customs Permit" regulations are discriminatory and close the open door. Trade in North China has virtually come to a standstill.</p>
<p>Japanese Discrimination Against Third-Country Nationals Marshall's speech first explained the Chamber's work in the past year, mostly related to issues arising from the Sino-Japanese War. He then said that in the past year, as battles continued on the front lines, the Japanese army has occupied North China, Central China, and South China. The most important ports and commercial markets have made it impossible for the National Government to utilize most of its customs revenue. The regulations promulgated by Japan due to military actions discriminate against third-country nationals. Judging from simple telegrams regarding the Central China Development Company, Japan's attempt to monopolize has become a reality.</p>
<p>North and East Areas Remain Closed Indefinitely Sixteen months have passed since the outbreak of the war in the Shanghai area, and restrictions are still imposed on Chinese people entering the North and East Areas, preventing them from rebuilding their industries in these two areas. The British-owned tram and bus companies, which have the privileges of the Municipal Council, are also unable to operate in these two areas, but the Japanese bus company, which has not obtained any legal rights, operates on the north bank of the Suzhou River.</p>
<p>Monopolizing the Yangtze River to Promote Japanese Goods Trade in Shanghai depends on free access to the interior. Any obstruction to the Yangtze River basin, Sichuan, and North China ports would be a fatal blow. War naturally obstructs trade routes, but "military needs and consideration for the welfare of foreign shipping cannot now be recognized as valid reasons for completely blockading the Yangtze River and prohibiting foreign merchant ships from navigating." In the past, Japanese merchant ships have been carrying goods to and from the ports along the Yangtze River. Japanese shipping companies have published advertisements in Chinese newspapers to transport goods to the interior. Japanese or Sino-Japanese joint ventures have also been opened in various ports along the Yangtze River. This is a very important matter for British merchants and British shipping. British trade and navigation have temporarily come to a standstill, while Japan has temporarily monopolized trade and navigation on the Yangtze River. Protests have been lodged against this in the past and will continue to be lodged in the future, but it seems that Japan has not understood its obligations to third-country nationals. At present, there is no satisfactory solution in sight.</p>
<p>Complete Domination of Inland Waterway Transportation Trade between the ports along the Yangtze River estuary is now proceeding normally, but Japan has recently used commercially rare means to prevent Chinese boatmen from approaching British ships, thus depriving British ships of trade. Japan's monopoly of inland waterway transportation also has a significant impact on British trade. Japan's control over all inland navigation in China is using discriminatory means, which directly violates the treaty rights enjoyed by Britain.</p>
<p>Illegal Confiscation of Chinese Factories One of the main features of 1938 was the establishment of a large number of factories in the Western District, demonstrating the courage and determination of Chinese industry. Although their factories in Yangshupu and other industrial centers have been lost, they have not hesitated to re-establish businesses in areas where they feel they can be free from interference. Although most are small-scale, they are progressing smoothly and will expand and lay a solid foundation. Many important factories of Chinese merchants in the Eastern District have been destroyed or stolen. If they have started operations, they are not managed by the original owners. It is heard that in Wuxi and Changzhou districts, which were formerly important industrial centers, many undamaged machines have been transported away by the Japanese army. Japan, while claiming that it earnestly hopes to promote the revival of its invaded areas, refuses to return privately-owned factories to their legitimate owners unless on the condition that they be jointly managed by Japanese and share the profits. Although Japan denies confiscating privately-owned factories or having the intention of confiscating them, the facts are all there. Whether confiscated or not, Japanese have forcibly occupied many factories and started operations without obtaining the permission of the original Chinese owners.</p>
<p>Many Goods at Wharves Go Missing Goods stored at Japanese wharves and China Merchants Bureau wharves could not be shipped out due to the war. Most have now been returned to their legitimate owners, but some have gone missing. Since the beginning of the war, both wharves have been under the control of the Japanese army and navy authorities. The Japanese authorities are therefore directly responsible for the disappearance of the goods.</p>
<p>The National Government Repays Foreign Debt In May 1938, the British and Japanese governments concluded a treaty stipulating that the customs revenue of the occupied ports should be deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank in the name of the Superintendent of Customs to repay a portion of the foreign debt. It should be handed over when needed and stipulates that the National Government should pay Japan's funds. Because the National Government did not join the treaty and did not approve it, although the customs revenue has been deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank, the treaty has not been fulfilled as far as the repayment of foreign debt is concerned. However, the National Government still repaid all foreign debt until December 31, 1938, when it announced that it would no longer fully repay foreign debt from January 1, 1939, and would use a percentage of the debt service payments from the revenue from the ports still under the management of the National Government and deposit it in the Central Bank.</p>
<p>Important Railways Operated Arbitrarily As a result of the Japanese army's invasion, China's important railways have been occupied by Japan, which are currently operating them. Japan disregards the fact that most of these railways are pledged to foreign bondholders and refuses to allow the representatives of the bondholders to investigate the condition of their property or manage a portion of it. Japan is now operating these railways, taking all the revenue, causing the bondholders to be temporarily deprived of their legitimate rights.</p>
<p>Issuing Banknotes to Control Foreign Exchange On February 11, 1938, the "United Reserve Bank," controlled by Japan, was established in North China. On March 10 of the same year, it issued banknotes with insufficient reserves. On March 11 of this year, the "Provisional Government" of North China promulgated regulations intended to force North China to use "United Reserve Bank" banknotes, which could not be freely converted into foreign exchange, in order to drive out legal tender with definite foreign exchange value. To facilitate the repayment of its wishes, the Customs forbade the export of certain major export commodities from North China. They must be exchanged for "United Reserve Bank" banknotes at the rate of one shilling and two pence per foreign exchange through the Yokohama Specie Bank before they can be exported. This rule automatically establishes a financial monopoly favorable to Japanese banks in North China. Although exporters are affected first, importers of foreign goods other than Japanese will soon be affected as well. There is no guarantee that the foreign exchange obtained from the export of goods can be used as capital for importing goods. The regulations are indeed discriminatory and violate the principle of the open door. The direct impact has been that trade in North China has virtually come to a standstill.</p>
<p>All Policies Are Clearly Exclusionary Judging from the news received from North China and Central China last year, the experiences in this port, and the news about the Central China Development Company, it is clear that Japan is adopting a policy that is favorable to Japan and the Japanese people. Japan claims that foreigners do not understand its intentions, but if these intentions maintain friendship, then there is no reason for the so-called misunderstanding on the part of others. Marshall then made a brief review of the work of the British Chamber of Commerce in the past year, followed by speeches by George, the Honorary Vice President of the Chamber, and the British Commercial Counsellor stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Regular Chinese Army Closes in on Shangnan Line; Heavy Fighting East of Zhoupu Yesterday Morning; Regular Army Enters Tangkou, Threatening Shangnan Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 6:00 AM, guerrilla warfare suddenly erupted in the countryside east of Zhoupu, the terminus of Shangnan Road. The guerrillas engaged in fierce combat with the mixed Japanese-puppet troops. The sound of gunfire and cannons reverberated far and wide. Along the banks of the Pu River, rumors spread that the ambushed guerrillas were also about to rise in response,</p>
<p>Further Tightening the Situation</p>
<p>Two to three hundred Japanese marines and army troops mobilized on Pudong Avenue to set up defenses and guard the area. The Dongchang Road ferry to the opposite bank was also temporarily closed, severing both land and water transportation. A large number of vegetable vendors and Chinese workers employed in Puxi were blocked from returning to Pudong. Subsequently, after completing their mission, the guerrillas retreated to their original base. The fighting subsided at 7:30 AM.</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM, water and land transportation resumed. The guard troops on Pudong Avenue also completely withdrew. Japanese troops at the Shangnan border divided up and searched civilian houses, but found nothing. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Shanghai Ferry Company's Zhoujiadu-bound "Chunjiang Maru," while waiting to load the last batch of passengers to Shanghai at Zhoujiadu, was unexpectedly seized by the Japanese when it sailed to Beishou Nanmatou (three miles from Zhoujiadu).</p>
<p>Temporarily Seized for Troop Transport, all passengers were driven ashore. As of 6:00 PM in the evening, the vessel had not yet returned, and its destination remained unknown. However, it is widely believed that this emergency measure was taken in response to the guerrillas in the Shangnan area. Furthermore, it is learned that Tangkou Town in Pudong, previously occupied by the loyal and patriotic army of Fan Gencai, is now being fiercely attacked by the puppet Nanhui "Self-Defense Corps,"</p>
<p>seeking to seize the tax checkpoint. The puppet troops suffered considerable casualties but remained undeterred. The day before yesterday, they gathered Japanese and "puppet" troops and advanced by land and sea, resulting in fierce fighting. Fan's troops, outnumbered and outmatched, retreated to Lujiahui. Just as the puppet "army" was feeling triumphant, Xu Xinzhou, commander of the Second Regiment of the 45th Brigade of the regular army, personally led his troops to arrive, completely driving out the Japanese and "puppet" troops.</p>
<p>Completely Expelled. The area is now under Xu's control, and Fan's troops have been incorporated into his ranks. Fan himself has gone to Tianmashan. It is said that the fighting has now closed in on the Shangnan Railway.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Volunteer Corps Inspection Ceremony</h3>
<p>Chinese Unit to Participate in Full Tomorrow Afternoon</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Volunteer Corps holds a full corps inspection every year in April or May as an important ceremony marking the end of the annual training. It is now learned that this year's grand review of the corps has been scheduled for tomorrow (the 16th) afternoon. At that time, members of the corps from all countries will participate in the ceremony to demonstrate their proficiency. It is planned that at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of that day, all units will assemble inside the Racecourse. At 2:45 PM, they will form ranks and set off. The review stand will be set up in front of the Shanghai Club on Jing'an Temple Road. The inspection will be conducted by the Commander of the British Forces in China and the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The route of the march will be from the west entrance of the Racecourse, proceeding along Jing'an Temple Road, Xieqiao Road, Tongfu Road, Weihaiwei Road, and a section of Route Tenant de la Tour. It is reported that our Chinese translation team of two squads, with all team members, will still be led by the Chinese Battalion Commander Chen Shixia, Major, and officers Li Yushu, Zhou Qingen, Wang Tingkui, Xu Shaomei, Xia Zaiyu, Zhong Yuting, Zhang Tinggui, etc. The enthusiastic atmosphere at that time can be anticipated.</p>
<h3>First Issue of Construction Bonds, 30 Million Yuan, Already Issued; Banks Accept Mortgages to Help Complete Construction; National Debt Fund Management Committee Manages Funds</h3>
<p>In order to meet the needs of the War of Resistance and develop the Southwest and Northwest regions, the National Government has approved the issuance of 600 million yuan in national currency of the 28th Year Construction Bonds of the Republic of China, to be issued in two tranches of 300 million yuan each on April 1st and August 1st, respectively, with an interest rate of 6% and a term of 25 years. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles in Shanghai yesterday that the first tranche of the construction bonds has been issued, designating the surplus profits from already established and newly established state-run enterprises and other construction projects, as well as the construction project funds levied from the salt tax, as the fund for principal and interest repayment. The Shanghai National Debt Fund Management Committee will manage the funds. The paying agents are the Central Bank and the Bank of China and Bank of Communications entrusted by it, as well as the Central Trust Bureau. If the designated funds for the bonds are insufficient, the national treasury will allocate the amount required to cover the shortfall. Although the bond face value stipulates full issuance, it is reported that there are no temporary plans to sell or solicit subscriptions from various parties. However, cash is being mortgaged to various banks. Because the government maintains consistent creditworthiness and continues to pay principal and interest on the domestic debts secured by salt tax and customs revenue on time, and because the bonds are reliably guaranteed and the proceeds will be used to complete construction projects, the banks have indicated their acceptance of mortgages to help the government complete domestic construction.</p>

<h3>Negotiations to Unload Cargo Fail; All Portuguese Shipping Halted; Portuguese Merchants Angrily Request Urgent Telegram to Tokyo to Protest; Puppet "Maritime Affairs Bureau" Seizes Opportunity to Covet</h3>
<p>The case of Portuguese merchant ships being detained by Japanese warships, totaling as many as ten thousand ships, is extremely serious. The Portuguese Consul visited Miura yesterday, requesting that the cargo be unloaded first, but the Japanese side evaded the issue, and no progress was made. At present, all shipping operations of Portuguese shipping companies have come to a complete standstill, resulting in significant losses. Portuguese merchants yesterday appointed representatives to visit the Portuguese Consul General, requesting that he urgently telegram the embassy in Japan to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese government. The "Deyao" and "Awei Mali" ships were delayed in arriving in Shanghai due to circumstances. The details of each situation are described below.</p>
<p>Negotiations to Unload Cargo Fail. Ten Portuguese ships arbitrarily detained by Japanese warships, including the "Tangbei," "Tangqiao," "Meida," "Libin," "Baode," "Lude," "Dade," and "Fulu," are currently anchored in the center of the Yangshupu River at buoys 16 to 19 and are being monitored by Japanese troops. The above-mentioned ships are either sailing from Shanghai to Wenzhou or from Wenzhou to Shanghai, carrying cargo such as textiles, sundries, foreign goods, and eggs, paper, sugarcane, and fruit transported from Wenzhou to Shanghai. Some of the cargo, such as eggs and fruit, has been stored for too long and is about to rot. Therefore, the company sent a representative, Mr. Pilila, to negotiate with the Japanese naval intelligence department, requesting permission to unload the cargo first. However, the Japanese side evaded the issue, saying that it would take a few days, and no progress was made. The Portuguese Consul General also visited Japanese Consul Miura again yesterday morning, but it is reported that there were no results.</p>
<p>All Portuguese Shipping Halted. A reporter from the Xiandai News Agency learned from shipping circles yesterday that there are nine Portuguese merchants engaged in shipping operations in the city, including Zhengde Shipping Company, Meili Shipping Company, Huamei Shipping Company, Kangsheng Shipping Company, Atlantic Shipping Company, Gosi De &amp; Co., and Liuzhou Company, with a total of more than 20 ships, sailing on routes such as Shanghai-Zhejiang, Shanghai-Fujian, Xingang, and Beisha. Since the incident of Japanese warships detaining a large number of Portuguese ships occurred on the 5th of this month, due to the seriousness of the issue, all Portuguese ships that have not been detained have temporarily suspended sailing in order to avoid accidents until the case is resolved. As a result, all shipping operations of Portuguese merchants in Shanghai have come to a complete standstill. Although the losses of the shipping companies are clearly estimated, they are very large.</p>
<p>Representatives of Portuguese Merchants Visit Consul General. All Portuguese merchants in the city believe that the detention of the ships has not been resolved, shipping businesses have come to a complete standstill, and even the Portuguese flag on each ship has been forcibly removed by the Japanese side. Regarding the national honor, it is considered to be a great shame. Therefore, they have held several meetings to discuss countermeasures. Representatives were appointed to request the Portuguese Consul General. Yesterday morning, Pilila, the manager of Zhengde Company, also visited the Portuguese Consul General, requesting that the details be telegraphed to the embassy in China as soon as possible to lodge a protest with the Japanese side. At the same time, he telegraphed the Portuguese ambassador to Japan, lodging a serious protest with the Tokyo government, so that the case could be resolved as soon as possible. It is also learned that Portuguese Consul General Elwes has recently been appointed by his government to be transferred to New York as Consul General. He was originally scheduled to depart on the 13th of this month to take up his new post. However, due to the unresolved Portuguese ship detention case, he has postponed his departure in order to focus on handling the matter.</p>
<p>"Deyao" and "Awei Mali" Delayed in Arriving in Shanghai. After a large number of Portuguese merchant ships were detained, all other ships were also suspended. Only the "Awei Mali" ship of Gosi De &amp; Co. continued to sail. The "Awei Mali" ship sailed to Xingang as usual at 10:00 PM on the 12th. The "Deyao" ship, represented by the Italian Yihua Foreign Firm, sailed to Beisha as usual on the morning of the 12th. Both ships were scheduled to return to Shanghai yesterday. According to company sources, the "Awei Mali" ship was delayed in arriving in Shanghai due to encountering wind at sea. The "Deyao" ship also did not arrive in port due to damage to its machinery.</p>
<p>Puppet Organization Attempts to Covet. According to a reporter from the Xiandai News Agency, the puppet "Weixin Government Ministry of Communications" recently established a "Maritime Affairs Bureau" in Shanghai in order to seize the authority to manage shipping and register civilian ships on the Huangpu River, thereby increasing revenue. The address of the "Bureau" is 55 North Sichuan Road. It is reported that the "Director" is Zhou Fushi, a disgrace to the shipping industry. After a large number of Portuguese ships were detained, Zhou made a statement to those close to the Portuguese merchants, saying that if they registered with the "Maritime Affairs Bureau," the ships could be expected to be returned, intending to induce cooperation and covet their property. However, the Portuguese merchants believe that each ship was legally purchased from Chinese merchants and that the property rights could not be falsely accused by the Japanese side. Therefore, they decided to continue negotiations through diplomatic channels and ignore the inducements of the puppet organization.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Commander Chen Caifu From Tonghai Area Feigns Surrender, Luring and Killing Japanese Troops, Killing Over a Hundred at Feast</h3>
<p>According to talks with Tongzhou customers, Chen Caifu, the guerrilla commander from the Tonghai area who was recently recruited by the Japanese army, has been trusted by the Japanese side after being appointed as the Tongzhou Police Chief by the Japanese side. However, Chen's surrender to the Japanese side was actually for a different purpose, as he planned to stage a shocking anti-Japanese masterpiece. It turns out that after Chen was entrusted with the important task of Tongzhou police affairs by the Japanese side, he obeyed the Japanese military authorities in everything. On the surface, he also actively engaged in recruiting guerrillas in the Tonghai area. Therefore, Chen's trust in the Japanese side increased with each passing day. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, Chen suddenly captured two bandits from the countryside near Tongzhou. After confirming their guilt, Chen ordered the two to be beheaded and their heads displayed to the public. At the same time, he posted two criminal charges, falsely claiming that the two criminals were guerrillas who had not been recruited and were plotting to attack the Japanese army, etc. Chen also feigned loyalty to the Japanese side, falsely claiming that the two criminals were the most powerful in the guerrilla team and had repeatedly refused to surrender, so he tried to capture them. He originally planned to send them to the Japanese army for interrogation, but because it was inconvenient to escort them along the way, he ordered them to be beheaded, etc. After this performance, the Japanese side's belief in Chen became even stronger. Chen took advantage of this opportunity to invite Japanese military officers to a banquet at a certain place outside Tongzhou City. A total of more than 30 Japanese military officers and 60 armed Japanese soldiers arrived. Chen slaughtered pigs and sheep that night, seemingly to reward the troops, but secretly deployed more than 400 plainclothes armed guerrilla members around. After the Japanese army arrived at their destination, they saw nothing unusual, so they set up their guns and rested, waiting to eat. Unexpectedly, before the pork and mutton were brought to their mouths, a signal was given, and ambush troops came out from all directions, annihilating all the Japanese troops on the spot and capturing many weapons. After the Japanese army in the city heard the news, they mobilized a large number of reinforcements to rush to the scene, only to find the bodies of most of the Japanese soldiers, while Chen and his troops had retreated far away. After the news spread, the people in the Tongzhou area were greatly relieved. It is now heard that Chen has received an order of commendation from the highest military authorities of China, helping Chen to carry out his mission from beginning to end and kill the enemy to achieve results.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Instruction Urges Prompt Payment of Profit-Seeking Income Tax; In Extraordinary Times, National Responsibility Should Be Expressed Through Eager Contributions</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued Instruction No. 7636 to urge the payment of profit-seeking income tax for the 26th and 27th years. The instruction states that regarding the deadline for filing and paying profit-seeking income tax, Article 8 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations stipulates that the income of the first category, items A and B, shall be reported by the taxpayer to the主管征收機關 (responsible collection agency) within three months after the annual tax settlement, according to the prescribed format. In addition, Rule 26, Paragraph 10 of the Implementation Rules stipulates that the payment deadline for the first category, items A and B, shall be from March 1st to the end of May, or from August 1st to the end of October each year, depending on the annual settlement period of each industry. This payment deadline was previously clarified by the Ministry in an explicit order as the final deadline that must not be exceeded. Before this deadline, after receiving the payment notice from the competent collection agency, the taxpayer should follow the instructions and report and pay the tax and should not delay intentionally. On March 5 of the 27th year, the No. 1605 instruction was issued to all income tax offices for compliance. Now that the tax collection period for profit-seeking income tax in the 27th year has arrived again, and that important cities in the rear have been ordered to evacuate their populations, there is deep concern that businesspeople in various industries may misinterpret the regulations and intend to delay payment, which would not be a prudent way to handle tax revenue. Therefore, the previous order is re-emphasized, urging each taxpayer to be clearly informed that they must pay taxes promptly after the settlement is completed and the payment notice is received, without delay, so as not to affect treasury revenue. Additionally, they are instructed to intensify investigations, reviews, and tax collection, so that taxpayers can express their responsibility to serve the country eagerly during the war of resistance. In addition to separate orders, they are urged to comply strictly with the above-mentioned handling matters. Upon receiving this, it is hereby notified for verification, hoping that it will be communicated to the businesses of each industry so that they will report and pay income tax at the time of settlement. In this extraordinary period, they should contribute eagerly to fulfill their responsibility to serve the country.</p>
<h3>Annual Meeting of Foreign Ratepayers Elects Chairman</h3>
<p>The annual meeting of foreign ratepayers in the Public Concession for this year has been scheduled for 2:30 PM on Wednesday, the 19th of this month, at the Grand Theatre. All motions for the annual meeting have been announced by the Shanghai Municipal Council. As for the position of Chairman of the Annual Meeting, His Honor Mr. Mossop, Judge of the Supreme Court for China, has been nominated to take the chair, and he has consented to do so.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Ningbo Mail Arrives in Shanghai After Blockade of Zhenhai Port; Transferred by Highway to Shanghai, Taking More Than Five Days</h3>
<p>Postal deliveries between Shanghai and Ningbo, since the blockade of Zhenhai Port, have been rerouted via the Ningbo-Jinhua highway, turning towards Yongkang, Lishui, and participating in Wenzhou, and then taking the sea route to Shanghai. Mail sent from Shanghai to Ningbo is also transported in this way, so the time is considerably delayed, taking more than five days. It is now learned that the first batch of mail from Ningbo sealed and sent to Shanghai via Wenzhou began to be divided and loaded onto the "Deping" and "Moufú" ships yesterday for distribution in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Central Savings Society to Hold Lottery Today</h3>
<p>The Central Savings Society will hold the 37th lottery draw today at 2:00 PM at its office at No. 2 Tianjin Road. The special prize has been increased to more than 27,000 yuan. The number of first, second, third, and fourth prizes has each been increased by one compared to last month, with 27 of each, giving savers more chances to win. Those who are interested in saving but have not yet joined can join quickly.</p>
<h3>Educator Chen Yuanru Passes Away</h3>
<p>Chen Yuanru, a renowned educator from Jiading, served as a inspector for Jiaqing County, principals of Lianxi and Fangtai Central Elementary Schools, and as a teacher at Nanyang Women's Normal School, Liqin Girls' High School, Minsheng Girls' High School, and other schools. In the 11th year of the Republic of China, he accepted an invitation from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Hua Tong Public School and lectured there for 18 years, nurturing countless talents. Overwork during the summer led to illness, and doctors strongly advised him to retire. Mr. Chen, saddened by the national crisis, strove to do his best and continued to teach despite his illness. As a result, his condition worsened day by day. He passed away on April 13th. It is heard that the funeral will be held at 2:00 PM today (the 15th) at the Central Funeral Home on Gordon Road and Ma Bai Road. The arrangements will be elaborate and solemn, without doubt.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Japanese Troops Arrive in Shanghai, Totaling Over 6,000; Marched from Suzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, troop movements were seen in the Hongqiao district, the largest since the end of the fighting in the Shanghai area. According to witnesses, at around 12:30 PM, a large number of Japanese troops arrived on Hongqiao Road, coming from the Suzhou area. They continued to arrive until the evening. The exact number was not accurately estimated last night, but some witnesses roughly guessed that it was between 6,000 and 8,000. In addition to the troops, there were several field artillery units and all the military supply vehicles, traveling along Hongqiao Road towards Zhabei. Last night, it was learned from responsible sources that these troops were garrisoned in Nanjing and transported by train to Suzhou, and then marched to Shanghai. The field artillery was carried by horses, and military trucks were used for supplies. It is heard that these troops were stationed in Jiangwan last night.</p>

<h3>After the Death of Fengxian Gentryman Chen Bo'an, Siblings Dispute Inheritance; Concubine Ms. Li Seizes Property; Wife and Children File Criminal Suit</h3>
<p>Chen Bo'an of Fengxian was a well-known local gentleman and merchant, and his wealth was considered the greatest in the county. In addition to real estate in his hometown, he had substantial deposits in major banks in Shanghai, and operated a pawnshop in the concession area. Chen had two wives, one being Ma Wenyun, who bore five children: Jun Gai, Jun Hui, Jun Ting, Jun E, and Jun Qu. They have all grown up and are serving in the business and academic worlds. The other wife was Ms. Li, who bore two sons: Jun Fu and Jun Tan. They are currently still in school. The "813"</p>
<p>Incident occurred the year before last. Fengxian, located on the coast, was subject to enemy occupation. Chen Bo'an therefore first led Ms. Li, Jun Fu, and Jun Tan, bringing with them property deeds and valuables, to seek refuge in Shanghai, lodging in a hotel. The rest of the family was scattered. Chen Bo'an, not long after arriving in Shanghai, due to old age and weakness, and unable to bear the hardship of displacement, fell ill at the hotel. In October, his son Jun E, born to Ma, arrived and saw his father's</p>
<p>critical condition. Fearing that the property would be difficult to verify after his death, he asked his father to invite Zhu Youqing, a relative in Shanghai, to the hotel, so that Zhu, in his capacity as a notary, could open a detailed inventory of the property evidence in the carried boxes, for future reference. However, when Jun E invited Zhu on that day, Bo'an had already been sent to Renji Hospital by Ms. Li, and died shortly after, so Zhu did not have time to handle the matter by the sickbed. Therefore, Jun E placed a seal</p>
<p>on all the boxes, which were still kept by Ms. Li and her son. Subsequently, Ma and her other four children, Jun Gai, etc., arrived in Shanghai and jointly inspected the items in the boxes with Ms. Li and her son, only to discover that the seal of that day had been removed and the property deeds in the boxes were all gone. Thus, a lawsuit over the inheritance arose between the Chen siblings. Because 593 Lafayette Road and 338 Avenue Joffre, where both parties resided, as well as the Baoda Pawnshop on Jin Shen Fu Road, were located in the French Concession, the case was accepted by the Second Special District Local Court.</p>
<p>After the first trial judgment, the losing party was dissatisfied and is still appealing to the Third High Court branch. Recently, Ma's children learned that Ms. Li's side had engaged in other acts of property seizure, and that these acts occurred in the Public Concession. Therefore, they led their four sons and one daughter and hired lawyers Gao Junxiang, Zhu Sifu, and Sha Yankai to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court against Ms. Li, her sons Jun Fu and Jun Tan, and her relatives Yang Jinglu and Yang Yaozhang (also known as Yang Shuzhen) for</p>
<p>criminal seizure. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing opened the court to summon and question them. The defendant's lawyer, Jiang Yiping, appeared in court and stated that Ms. Li was ill and that her two sons were young and still in school, so they could not surrender themselves at this time. He requested a postponement and, in order to clarify the contents of the case, requested that the case file be collected from the Third High Court branch for review. The court then briefly questioned the plaintiffs Chen Jun Gai, Jun E, and Jun Qu, who had appeared in court, about the types of property stored in the boxes and the reasons for not opening an inventory. The court ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for the 24th of this month.</p>
<h3>Sailing Ship "Taiping" Departed Shanghai Yesterday Morning; Expected to Arrive in San Francisco by the End of July</h3>
<p>The Westerner couple, the Andersons, previously sailed to San Francisco, USA, non-stop, with companion Zelek Kevitani and three Chinese sailors, aboard the Ningbo-style sailing ship "Taiping." Unexpectedly, after departing Shanghai on the 7th and sailing for two days, they suddenly returned to Shanghai last Sunday. The reason for the sudden return is unknown. It is said that there was a mechanical failure. One theory is that a companion changed their mind at the last minute. It is now learned that the Anderson couple has decided to continue sailing to the United States on the original ship. It is heard that they departed Shanghai yesterday morning. If they do not encounter any accidents on the way, they can arrive at the Gold Island near San Francisco by the end of July this year to participate in the World's Fair being held there.</p>
<h3>Metropolitan Ballroom: Eviction Lawsuit Occurs; Hengye Company Orders Eviction, Ballroom Authorities Refute with Reason</h3>
<p>The land at the site of the current Metropolitan Garden Ballroom at the intersection of Gordon Road and Jing'an Temple Road was originally vacant land owned by the American company Puye Real Estate. On May 7, 1935, Metropolitan signed a lease agreement with Puye Company for this vacant land to build a ballroom. At that time, it was stipulated that the monthly rent would be 700 national currency units. If someone later wanted to lease the land at a higher price, Puye Company would provide proof and notify the Metropolitan authorities. If Metropolitan wished to continue leasing, they would have to increase the rent to the amount offered by the third party. This contract was an indefinite contract. Metropolitan,</p>
<p>Since signing the contract, immediately constructed buildings and laid out gardens on the vacant land, spending no less than 100,000 gold units. By May 1938, the ownership of the land was transferred from Puye Real Estate Company to the British company Hengye Real Estate Company, and the lease agreement with Metropolitan was also transferred simultaneously. There were no disputes until last year when there were disagreements among the shareholders of Metropolitan, and some shareholders withdrew. Manager Jiang Yaozhang then</p>
<p>Recruited new shareholders to join. At this time, Hengye Company suddenly notified Metropolitan in October of last year that from January 1, 1939, the monthly rent would have to be increased to 850 yuan. Jiang Yaozhang had no objection to the rent increase, but felt that the indefinite term of the lease was inappropriate. Therefore, he immediately entrusted British lawyer Mr. Rickes to negotiate with Hengye Company Manager Smith to establish a fixed-term contract of three years. Hengye then</p>
<p>Proposed several conditions that Metropolitan should comply with. Hengye notified that from January 1, 1939, the rent would be increased to 850 yuan, and Metropolitan must be organized as a British Limited Company. If the market price fluctuates, use nine pence as the standard to determine rent increases or decreases. These conditions were repeatedly discussed, and Metropolitan accepted them one by one. Just as they were about to revise the contract, Hengye Company suddenly notified in writing on December 28 of last year, stating that according to the previously agreed contract, if both parties</p>
<p>Wished to terminate the contract, they could give notice three months in advance. Now, based on the contract, our company is limiting Metropolitan to return the leased land by March 31, 1939, and demolish the buildings on the land to restore it to its original condition. Metropolitan believed that Hengye Company was going back on its word and that there was obviously another motive. Therefore, in addition to complying with Hengye's previous notice to increase the rent to 850 yuan, they also expressed opposition to the eviction. After the deadline of March 31, Hengye immediately hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court against Metropolitan to recover the leased land and restore it to its original condition, and also applied for</p>
<p>Permission for provisional execution. Yesterday, Judge Ni Zheng'ao of the Special Court held a hearing to summon the parties. Metropolitan retained lawyers Chen Tingrui and Wu Linkun to appear in court to defend their case. Their reasoning was roughly as follows: Although the contract signed by the original and defendant parties in this case appeared to be an ordinary agreement on the surface, the actual land leased by the defendant at that time was only vacant land. Later, buildings were constructed on the land, so it was actually a superficies right under Article 834 of the Civil Code. According to the provisions of superficies rights, the contract can only be terminated if rent is owed for more than two years. The defendant has never been in arrears with any rent, even when the war broke out and the ballroom closed</p>
<p>to be used as a wounded soldier hospital, the rent was still paid. And recently, the plaintiff notified of a rent increase, which was also complied with. Moreover, after the plaintiff proposed the rent increase, the defendant not only agreed but also negotiated a fixed-term lease with the plaintiff. The defendant also endured and reluctantly accepted the various conditions proposed by the plaintiff. At that time, there were more than a dozen letters exchanged between the two parties. However, the plaintiff even published articles in newspapers to undermine the defendant's business, which was obviously for another motive. According to a publication in a certain tabloid, it was said to be due to the</p>
<p>Message that some of the shareholders who withdrew wanted to excavate the land. Combined with the plaintiff's fickle behavior, it is sufficient to prove that the plaintiff's lawsuit was instigated by a third party. In short, the defendant has not been in arrears with any rent, and has even complied with the rent increase, so it has not violated any legal or contractual provisions. As for the plaintiff's reliance on the three-month notice requirement in the contract, it should be known that this clause is a procedure for terminating the contract, not a reason for terminating the contract. If</p>
<p>If this condition is considered a reason for terminating the contract, then Metropolitan could just finish building the house today, and tomorrow the plaintiff could notify them to move out in three months. Wouldn't that be childish? Therefore, we should ask the court to reject the plaintiff's lawsuit and order them to bear the litigation costs. As for the provisional execution, the defendant is not in arrears with rent and has a deposit of 2,100 yuan, so we also ask that it be rejected together, and submit various evidences for examination. Judge Ni, after reviewing the case, declared the debate closed and scheduled a date for the judgment to be announced.</p>
<h3>Loan Unsuccessful: Plot by Monk of Tu Hai Temple</h3>
<p>Kong Ci, the abbot of Fuguo Temple at 4725 Robison Road and a native of Taizhou, loves to drink. He often keeps a wine bottle in his meditation room. Before going to sleep, he must drink several cups of yellow wine. At around 6:00 PM on the 12th, Kong Ci entered the meditation room, took out a full wine bottle, and poured the yellow liquid into a cup, disregarding the different color of the wine. He drank it and</p>
<p>Tasted bitter. He felt very strange and puzzled. He then spat out the wine and poured the remaining wine in the bottle onto the ground elsewhere. He then went to a nearby wine shop to buy some to drink. The taste was the same. The next day, he learned from a visiting monk named Guangyu that the monk Zhaokong, a native of Taizhou in the temple, had been wanting to return home for two weeks, but his request for a loan of 80 yuan was not granted</p>
<p>Building resentment. He put medicine into the wine bottle in Kong Ci's meditation room, plotting to harm Kong Ci's life. So, yesterday, he reported the situation to the Putuo Road Police Station in charge, who dispatched detectives to arrest the monk Zhaokong. They found a glass tube containing</p>
<p>Powder under his bed. They took the person and the item to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and said that the defendant claimed at the police station that the powder was fruit salt, which would cause people to</p>
<p>Have diarrhea. It was not poisonous, but just a joke with the abbot monk Kong Ci. This case is requested to be postponed and the powder sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council Laboratory for testing. Then, Abbot Monk Kong Ci and Monk Guangyu testified about what happened. When questioned, the defendant's confession was hesitant. Judge Huang Risheng ordered him to remain in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>Another Elimination of Traitors Case in Suzhou: Puppet Civil Affairs Secretary Assassinated; Shot Dead by a Strong Man While Flaunting in a Chartered Car</h3>
<p>Another assassination occurred in Suzhou the day before yesterday. The assassinated person was Yao Zhian, secretary of the puppet "Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Provincial Government." Yao lived in Minle Lane, Bifengfang, Lindun Road in Suzhou City. At 9:30 AM on the 13th of this month, Yao was riding in a chartered car from home to the puppet "Department" to work when he reached the intersection of Lindun Road and Guanqian Street. Suddenly, a strong man jumped out from the roadside and fired at Yao. Four shots were fired at the time, two hitting Yao's chest. He immediately splattered with blood and fell from the car to his death. The assassin, seeing that his goal had been achieved, left calmly, disappearing without a trace. Afterwards, the Japanese and puppet authorities in Suzhou immediately imposed martial law and searched the area, but found nothing. According to reports, Yao, also known as Ji'an, was originally a teacher at an elementary school in Suzhou. After the establishment of the puppet "Suzhou Autonomous Association," Yao, a poor and humble scholar, suddenly became a member of the "Association." After the puppet "Association" was disbanded, Yao took the current puppet position.</p>

<h3>Case of Shooting Xi Shitai: Dying Words of a Hero; Three People Participated in Killing Xi, the Shooter Was a Fugitive Named You</h3>
<p>According to the "North-China Daily News," Peng Fulin (23 years old), the suspect arrested in Baolong Hospital after the assassination of Xi Shitai, secretary of the puppet "Dadao Municipal Government" "Public Security Bureau," on Tuesday morning, died of his injuries yesterday (the 13th) afternoon at 3:00 PM. It is said that as Peng was about to die, he summoned detectives to his bedside and admitted to being one of the three people who shot and wounded Chinese Constable No. 730 who was chasing him. It is said that Peng also claimed that only three people participated in the shooting, one of whom is at large. Another suspect is now being held at the Central Police Station. His name is Zhao Baisheng (transliteration), and he also admitted to being one of the terrorists, saying that he was assigned to keep watch and signal when Xi left the alley to notify the others. However, he did not carry any weapons. The person who actually killed Xi was named You Dechang (transliteration), whom he had only met a few days ago. Zhao also stated during interrogation that he did not know where the assassination order came from. Detectives from the Public Concession and the French Concession are still investigating in order to capture the person named You and obtain more detailed information about the masterminds of the terrorist act. According to the investigation so far, it seems clear that the three people involved in the shooting on Tuesday were indeed members of a group that wanted to eliminate Xi. Also, Peng Fulin was unconscious after entering the hospital, so he could not be interrogated. However, he regained consciousness for about half an hour before his death, and the detectives at his bedside were able to hear his last words. Zhao Baisheng was also at his bedside at the time. Peng denied shooting Xi, but admitted to shooting at the Chinese Constable and being one of the three terrorists.</p>
<h3>Former Local Bully of Fahua Town Suddenly Arrested</h3>
<p>Wang Xinda, a native of Fahua in western Shanghai, was a "big shot" in the eastern and western towns of Fahua and had considerable potential influence. In 1927, he was arrested by the Public Concession Police on suspicion of kidnapping and sentenced to five years in prison by the former Provisional Court. After serving his term, he specialized in being a "big shot" in the Fahua area. Since the outbreak of the August 13 Incident two years ago and the westward shift of the war situation, there were rumors that a puppet organization appointed Wang as the chairman of the Fahua Maintenance Association. Wang opened a gambling den called the Dali Company Club in Fahua. On the third day of the first lunar month of this year, the guerrillas sent people to search Wang's home in Fahua East Town and confiscated a pistol. Wang was not at home at the time and was not arrested. From then on, Wang moved to 39 Haigeli, Haige Road in the French Concession for safety reasons, living in seclusion. It is now heard that at midnight on the 12th, the French Police sent detectives to arrest Wang Xinda and take him back to the police station to await investigation. The reason for his arrest is said to be related to the case where his sister, Wang Guizhen, colluded with her lover, Tao Boqing, to murder her former lover, Chen Tingsheng, also known as Chen Sanzi, on the 20th of last month. Whether this is true remains to be confirmed.</p>
<h3>Case of Murdering One's Husband: Trial Concluded, Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>The Adulterous Woman's Brother Released</p>
<p>Pang Kaibao, a road worker from Jiangbei, had an affair with Zhang Er Guniang, the wife of Dou Youqing, a fellow townsman living in a bungalow on Hangzhou Road, Yangshupu. The adulterous couple actually took advantage of Dou Youqing's deep sleep in bed at around 1:00 AM on February 21st and hacked him several times in the temple with a sharp ax, killing him. They then carried the body to a deserted pond nearby and used a rope to tie the body around the waist, one end using a lead bucket filled with stones to sink it. After the case was discovered, the suspects were arrested, including Zhang Youfu, the brother of the runaway Zhang Er Guniang, and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The details have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng went to court to conclude the investigation. Pang Kaibao was returned to custody, and a date was set for sentencing. Zhang Youfu was found to be unrelated, and the police's request for his release was approved.</p>
<h3>Petty Official Embezzlement Case: Appeal Overturns Previous Confession</h3>
<p>Mao Zhenyu, a native of Taicang, is 23 years old this year. He has been a petty official at the Tongfa Public Customs Brokerage at 78 Tianzhutang Street in the French Concession for more than seven years. His monthly salary is only seven yuan. In recent years, Mao has been forging receipts from Taikoo Company and other companies, adding hundreds of digits to deceive the brokerage's accounting department and obtain money for personal use. He also relied on this income to marry last year, spending 2,000 yuan. It was not until the beginning of last month that Xiao Zhemian, the Guangdong owner of the brokerage, discovered that he had embezzled more than 3,000 yuan. He also found 13 forged receipts and reported them to the French Police, who detained Mao and prosecuted him in the Second Special Court according to law. Mao also confessed to embezzling about 2,000 yuan. The first instance sentenced Mao to one year in prison. Mao was dissatisfied with the verdict and retained lawyer Zhang Shibeng to appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday, the collegial panel held a hearing. Mao's grounds for appeal overturned his previous confession, denying forging receipts and embezzling. He said that he resigned at the end of last year because his salary was low. At that time, he checked the accounts with the accounting department and found no errors. Later, he was suddenly accused of embezzlement. He was forced to confess at the police station. The court reviewed the confession and decided to postpone the hearing for further questioning after summoning witnesses. Mao was still remanded to the detention center.</p>

<p>The Workers Put Forward Three Conditions That the Capital Accepted; Work Resumed Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Swiss-owned ABC Commercial Printing House on Sichuan Road in this city has more than 100 workers. All wages are calculated on a piece-rate basis. After the August 13th Shanghai War broke out, the capital reduced the daily working hours from eight and a half hours to seven and a half hours due to sluggish business, and wages were calculated at a 10% discount. Recently, the workers, seeing that the factory's business has returned to normal and that the cost of living, clothing, food, and housing has soared, felt that it was difficult to maintain their livelihoods and made a request to the factory, but to no avail. Therefore, they all announced a strike the day before yesterday afternoon, putting forward the following conditions for improving treatment: (1) Restore working hours to eight and a half hours; (2) Wages must no longer be discounted; (3) The capital will provide additional subsidies. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, representatives such as Xu A'gen were sent to negotiate with the factory manager in person. As a result, the capital fully accepted the first two items.

<h3>Ministry of Education Convenes a Training Discussion Meeting Minister of Education Chen Publishes Training Proposals and Passes a Motion to Implement a Tutoring System</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Chongqing) From March 31st to April 1st, the Ministry of Education convened a training discussion meeting, gathering the directors of education departments from Sichuan, Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, and other provinces, as well as the training directors from universities across the country. The agenda was as follows: the first day, 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, speeches and training reports; 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM, training reports; the second day, 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, group discussions; 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM, plenary session; 7:00 PM, closing ceremony. On the first day, Minister Chen Lifu personally presided over the meeting and delivered a speech on education in our country, lasting four hours.</p>
<p>Chen's Speech</p>
<p>Chen's speech mainly stated that the biggest shortcomings of our country's people are two: one is a lack of organization, and the other is a lack of enthusiasm. Because there is no organization, everyone is selfish and self-interested, and the country presents a chaotic phenomenon. Because there is no enthusiasm, everyone is lifeless, and the country presents a dull state. To remedy these ills, the only way is "rites" and "music." Rites and music are to complete moral education. If rites and music are not practiced, morality will be lost, and rewards and punishments will not be clear. Rites are about order and solemnity, with layers of control from top to bottom, division of labor and cooperation from left to right, and neat steps. Rites are also about standardization and unification. According to this standard, school training should be strictly implemented. Music is about being lively and vigorous, the education of the seven emotions, but not being unconstrained, still having discipline, and receiving considerable adjustments in spirit. The spirit of rites is like a father, father-style education, rigid, deciding on outlines, containing the nature of should and should not. The spirit of music is like a mother, mother-style education, soft, verbose, containing why should be so and should not be so. The education in foreign churches is the education of rites and music. Without rites is like without a father, then it is an orphan; without music is like without a mother, then it is a grieving child. Our country has not practiced rites and music for a long time, and has become a nation of orphans and grieving children. Therefore, rites and music should be remedied from the root, otherwise, we are truly disloyal subjects and rebellious sons.</p>
<p>Chen's training proposals are: (1) One central belief: "sincerity"; (2) Five relationships: "ruler and subject, father and son, brothers"; (3) Three key points: "wisdom, benevolence, courage"; (4) Six methods: "rites, music, writing, mathematics, archery, charioteering"; (5) Eight steps: "investigation of things, extension of knowledge, sincerity of intention, rectification of the heart, cultivation of the person, regulation of the family, governing the state, pacifying the world." Then, he elaborated on the meaning of sincerity, the six arts, wisdom, benevolence, courage, and the five relationships, and the listeners were all moved. Following Chen's instruction was Vice Minister Gu Yuxiu, who explained wisdom, benevolence, and courage with unique insights. Gu said that wisdom is creation, benevolence is service, and courage is sacrifice. He cited many scientists who created and sacrificed for the benefit of the public. The inventor of the long-distance telephone died of starvation, which is the most prominent example.</p>
<p>After the two finished speaking, someone asked whether the school motto should be unified. Minister Chen said that the ministry had already ordered the schools, but now Chiang Kai-shek's intention is to set "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace" as the "national motto" and "rites, righteousness, integrity, and shame" as the "school motto."</p>
<p>Group Meetings</p>
<p>After the schools and departments reported on the implementation of training and the difficulties encountered, group discussions were held. They were divided into two groups, one for colleges and universities, convened by Director Wu Junsheng, with participants including Zhang Dingyi, Zhou Shang, Jing Yunjie from the Ministry of Education, and representatives from various schools such as Cha Liangzhao, Yuan Dunli, and Wang Shulin. The other group was for secondary schools, convened by Director Gu Shusen, with participants including Zhong Daozan, Dai Yingguan from the ministry, and representatives from departments and schools such as Zheng Tonghe, Zhang Zhihan, and Wang Jiesan. The proposals discussed by the two groups were the same: (1) the issue of implementing the tutoring system; (2) the issue of social service; (3) the issue of standards for assessing conduct; (4) the issue of student attitude.</p>
<p>Important Resolutions</p>
<p>The important resolutions of the plenary session were as follows: (1) How to effectively implement the tutoring system: 1. Create public opinion; 2. Pay attention to the distribution of teachers' work; 3. Stipulate simple forms; 4. Hold a entrustment ceremony. The tutoring system in secondary schools should be different from that in universities, with separate male and female tutors, and with class as the unit. Schools with more than 25 students per class should set up group tutors, and branch schools should set up branch school tutors. (2) Omitted. (3) How to implement social service and labor service: 1. Determine the scope of service, such as those related to the War of Resistance, production, education, and hygiene; 2. Determine according to local conditions and the location of the school; 3. Utilize summer and winter vacations; 4. Need supervision, etc. (4) How to stipulate the standards for assessing conduct: 1. The ministry should set standards; 2. Determine the method of criticism; 3. Should be based on physical fitness, character, scholarship, and service. At the closing ceremony, Minister Chen delivered a speech, lasting one and a half hours, and the meeting concluded successfully.</p>

<h3>Reading Notes on the Exhibition of Chinese Paintings of Past Dynasties (1)</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>The exhibition of Chinese paintings of past dynasties promotes the relics of ancestors and elaborates the national culture. It is of profound significance and has a major mission. The reporter has already published an article on personal feelings in the "Chunqiu" column of this newspaper. Now I will write down the impressions of the visit for the correction of readers.</p>
<p>(1) Tang Zhou Fang's "Washing Infant Picture" The oldest in this painting exhibition is Zhou Fang's "Washing Infant Picture." Zhong Lang was originally good at figures and ladies, and his paintings are of divine quality. He was once ordered to paint murals in Zhangjing Temple, which were the best at the time. This painting is a two-foot horizontal scroll, painted with color on silk. There are five ladies in the picture, with beautiful eyebrows and delicate features. The folds of the clothes are like Cao Yi's coming out of the water and Wu Dai's wind. There are also five babies, either bathing, holding, lying, standing, or sitting, each with its own posture, exquisite and lively, and the charm is beautiful and lovely.</p>
<p>(2) Five Dynasties Guan Tong's "Heavy Rivers and叠 Mountains" Although landscape painting originated in the Northern and Southern Dynasties and flourished in the Tang Dynasty, the one who achieved great success and reached the peak was Guan Tong, a disciple of Jing in the Five Dynasties. However, except for a few pieces collected by the Palace Museum, Jing Guan's works are rarely circulated. This is an eight-foot large painting, ink and color on silk, with a majestic momentum, highlighting the vast Fan Li, and it is indeed a good construction in Chang'an. At the lower left end, there is an inscription by Ye Gongchuo, "The only Guan Tong work in the world." Ye is a master of appreciation, so it is not a false reputation.</p>
<p>(3) Ninth Dynasty Person's "Revealing Bowl Picture" Cao Zhongxuan and Zhou Wenju were good at Buddha statues and ghosts in the Five Dynasties. This painting may have been done by the hands of Cao and others, a three-foot horizontal scroll, painted with color on silk. There are countless gods in the landscape painting of the gods, which are meticulous and unprecedented. The blue and green landscape setting, the hills and ravines are strict, and the colors are bright and beautiful. It has not changed after more than a thousand years. It is really precious. There are inscriptions by Zhang Shen, Gao Qi, Qian Pu, and others.</p>
<p>(4) Five Dynasties Zhong Kui's "祉衮 Picture" Painted with color on paper, more than three feet high and less than two feet wide. In addition to Zhong Kui, there is also a lady and plum blossoms. Wu Hufan's inscription says that the brush is extremely ancient, like the Dong Yuan school.</p>
<p>(5) Song Shi Huichong's "Huaxi Meeting Bird Picture" Painted with color on silk, more than three feet high and one foot wide. Huichong was originally known for water birds, and this painting is even more meticulous. Wang Shimin praised it as rare and precious.</p>
<p>(6) Song Huizong's "Snow Parrot and Danli Picture" Among the emperors of the Song Dynasty who were good at painting, there were also Renzong, who was good at Buddha horses, Qinzong, who was good at figures, and Gaozong, who was good at landscapes, not only Huizong alone, and the most passed down is Huizong. This painting is painted with color on silk. There is a white parrot on a lychee tree in the picture. The lychees are unusually bright red, reflecting the white parrot. The brush is also strong and beautiful, which is a fine product of Huizong.</p>
<p>(7) Song Liu Songnian's "Fishing Music Picture" Painted with color on silk, more than three feet high and one foot wide. A large pine tree is shaded on the hillside by the water's edge. Three fishing boats intersect and gather. The peaks rise steeply, and the treetops are mossy like Fan Kuan's method. The water waves under the mountain are patterned. The fishermen are leisurely. Songnian originally belonged to the strict court style, but this painting shows vitality in the meticulousness.</p>
<h3>More Schools in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The number of schools has reached 850, and more than 3,000 Chinese teachers are registered.</p>
<p>The development of schools in Hong Kong has suddenly accelerated, reaching as many as 857. A total of 2,209 Chinese teachers applied to the Hong Kong Education Department for registration last year, and another 231 have been added this year. It was previously rumored that the Hong Kong Education Department would restrict the increase in the number of teachers, raise the standards for assessing teachers, and restrict the registration of teachers from the mainland to Hong Kong to avoid competition with the original teachers in Hong Kong, which would affect teachers' salaries. It is now learned that this is not true.</p>
<h3>School News</h3>
<p>Lixin Accounting School Morning School The morning school of Lixin Accounting School at No. 406 Jiangxi Road officially started on April 12. There are courses such as advanced bookkeeping and cost accounting. The number of students enrolled is very enthusiastic. It is said that there are still vacancies in each course.

Cao Guilin and Jiang Bodun are in charge of the senior three department, and Wu Shupeng and Zhu Yongxin are in charge of the junior three department. Principal Zhao Mianyun and Jiang Yinqiu are invited to write the preface, and Dean Zheng Yimei is invited to write the school history.</p>
<p>Dazhong Middle School Dazhong Middle School on Niuzhuang Road has recently moved to its new school building at the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Hardoon Road due to the large number of students and insufficient school buildings. The location is a residential area, quiet and free from noise, and the transportation is also convenient. Moreover, the school building is a single building, and there is a wide courtyard inside the front wall, which can be used for students' extracurricular activities. The classrooms and dormitories are very spacious, and the books and instruments are placed in another room, which can be used for students' reference inside and outside the classroom.

<h3>A Man's Good Health is the Ironclad Guarantee of Marital Bliss</h3>

<p>A virgin's heart is bright, pure, and most beautiful. Sometimes, in her graceful ideals, there appears a wonderful family, clever children, and a happy married life... But once married, these beautiful ideals often become like fleeting dreams, disappearing, leaving behind only emptiness and sorrow! Such women probably constitute the majority in today's society.</p>
<p>Marriage, to put it bluntly, is a desire for comfort and joy because of feelings of loneliness in body and mind. Indeed, when a beautiful and affectionate woman marries a strong and virile man, because of the wonders of nature, he brings joy to me and also joy to you. Their love will surely be infinitely tender and sweet, giving birth to clever children, organizing a happy family. Their lives are fresh and rich; their future is bright and vast; because they are encouraged and nourished by love, and driven and promoted by healthy vitality, this is truly glorious and happy! Why is married life often filled with sorrow? According to our physiological research, it is mostly due to physical or mental defects. And these defects are mostly found in men. Therefore, when a young woman chooses a partner, she should be realistic, get rid of vanity; property, status, family background, etc., are not the most important conditions; the most important thing is physical health. Because physical health is the ironclad guarantee of marital happiness.</p>
<p>Why do men often have physical and mental defects? This is mostly due to early years of masturbation and nocturnal emission, or post-marital debauchery and excessive labor, which damage sexual function, causing spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, underdevelopment, infertility, neurasthenia, etc. Then, in married life, he cannot bring joy to his wife, and in his career, he cannot strive and achieve. Therefore, how can the wife not feel disappointed and saddened! As a result, all kinds of tragedies in the family are enacted, which is also a very common occurrence! At the same time, if these diseases are not treated for a long time, they will lead to premature aging or even endanger life! The only remedy, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, is to take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Shengzhisulin," which is the most effective treatment. This agent is replicated using scientific methods from the reproductive gland hormones extracted from strong animals such as gorillas and sea dogs. Therefore, the quality is precious and the efficacy is great. After taking it, it can produce sperm, tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish nerves in one day and night. If you continue to take it, you will be able to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and you can also achieve the effect of prolonging life, rejuvenating and regaining youth. However, those who have nocturnal emissions must also take "Himitoshigu Jingpian" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop emissions, so that both the symptoms and the root cause can be treated, and the effect is even faster.</p>
<p>Beauty and Health</p>
<h3>The Value of Beautiful Breasts</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Aesthetic concepts have changed, no longer valuing the face but the breasts. If the breasts are shriveled due to illness, heavy makeup is in vain!</p>
<p>In the past, men looked at women, they only looked at the head and feet, so-called "cloud-like hair and mist-like hair are all suitable, golden lotuses captivate the heart with every step," but now men look at women, this kind of wrong concept has been completely abandoned, their two lightning-like eyes are only aimed at the woman's chest. If they see that the woman's breasts are high and undulating when she moves, showing a fully seductive and proud posture, then even if her face is ordinary, they will appreciate and cherish her as if they have discovered a treasure, praising her endlessly. Conversely, if her breasts are shriveled due to masturbation, breast binding, or menstrual irregularities, prolonged leucorrhea, or weakness after illness, resulting in impaired ovarian function, affecting metabolism, and forming a shriveled state, then even if she wears heavy makeup or has a very beautiful face, I can say with certainty that love between men and women is difficult to sustain, because the appearance of the dress is not as precious as healthy beauty. If the breasts are withered, even if the husband does not hate her, she will always feel extremely ashamed, right?!</p>
<p>Therefore, now smart women attach great importance to their breasts. If they are unfortunately shriveled, they will immediately take the ovarian preparation for women "Shengzhisulin" to save them, because this medicine has a peaceful nature and great efficacy. All kinds of women's hidden diseases can be cured for you in a short period of time. If you continue to take it and persevere, it will not only make the shriveled breasts become full and high, but also rejuvenate you, make your cheeks rosy, and add to your beauty.</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emissions Will Ruin a Young Man's Future</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>A young man is like the sun just rising over the mountains, he should have unlimited future and brightness. In the fire of his life, there is a burning heat, but this heat must be used on a righteous and bright road. If this heat is misused, such as young people suffering from sexual depression, committing masturbation, lustful thoughts, and excessive indulgence, resulting in nocturnal emissions, then the reproductive gland fluid in the body, which dominates our health and lifespan, will be lost in large quantities, so that all kinds of diseases arise, and symptoms such as brain failure and forgetfulness, tinnitus and blurred vision, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, and physical fatigue will follow. In terms of sexual function, because the sexual nerves lose their responsibility, symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, infertility, and underdevelopment will also come one after another. Then, in married life, he will not be able to satisfy his wife, and love will be weakened, or even lead to all kinds of tragedies in the family! Young men, whose bodies are already weak, suffer more from this torment, and become prematurely aged, die young, and their future is only hell and death!</p>
<p>The only way to seek remedy is to take "Himitoshigu Jingpian," which can consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, reduce wet dreams, and allow for peaceful sleep, so that nocturnal emissions can be cured. If nocturnal emissions have already caused the above symptoms, it is necessary to also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Shengzhisulin" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, and nourish the nerves. If you continue to take it, you will be able to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and you can also achieve the effect of prolonging life, rejuvenating and regaining youth. However, if patients can come to this clinic in person for diagnosis by expert doctors, and use various treatments such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, complete cure can be guaranteed.</p>

<h3>Principles for a Radical Cure of Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>Radically curing gonorrhea is not difficult. In some cases, it is even easier than treating the flu. The so-called "some cases" refers to acute leukorrhea. In acute gonorrhea, if a careful diagnosis can be made to determine the location of the gonococcus, and then treated accordingly, there is no chance of not being completely cured in five or six days, or at most seven or eight days, with an absolute guarantee. However, many doctors always think that gonorrhea in the acute stage does not distinguish between symptoms, and always uses outdated old-fashioned therapies, or takes over-the-counter medicines that are not suitable for the symptoms. This kind of carving a boat to find the sword therapy will repeatedly mislead the acute gonorrhea that could have been quickly cured, reduce the patient's original resistance, and is tantamount to opening the door to invite thieves, forcing the poison inside. If you want to quickly and radically cure gonorrhea, it is really going in the opposite direction. Therefore, those who are infected with gonorrhea for the first time must not treat their own health and happiness as a child's play and use unreasonable treatments.</p>
<p>To radically cure gonorrhea – in the case of acute gonorrhea – the first thing to do is to make a careful diagnosis, such as using a urethroscope to check whether the inflammation has extended to the posterior urethra, and using a cystoscope to check whether it has become cystitis, and using a super-magnification microscope to check whether there are other bacteria mixed in with the gonococcus. All of these are basic conditions for radically curing acute gonorrhea. Then inject a specially made autogenous vaccine to resist and kill gonococcus, and make it produce an immune effect. Furthermore, use the German Filtrin-Flow electrotherapy to directly transmit the bactericidal heat to the gonococcus between the lesions. According to this principle, radically curing acute gonorrhea, and following the symptoms to perform painless and agile surgery, can relieve pain on the same day, clear turbidity and eliminate inflammation on the same day. The speed and thoroughness of the radical cure are above the general muddy water therapy.</p>

<h3>The Key to the European Situation</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>The instability of the European situation is, of course, due to the wolfish ambitions, bared fangs, and rampant ferocity. But Chamberlain's laissez-faire attitude is the biggest reason for nurturing the disease and leaving behind problems. Because I have said long ago that wanting the greedy to know satisfaction and stop at the appropriate point is like seeking the skin of a tiger, which will never become a reality. The only way is to use force to stop its progress, or to surround it tightly, or to strike it head-on. Then it will retreat in the face of difficulty and escape with its tail between its legs.</p>
<p>Now Chamberlain has indeed become somewhat aware and is trying to surround it; but it is still not thorough. The crux of the problem remains, and there will eventually be a day of collapse, allowing the bacteria to wreak havoc. Why? This is also what I have repeatedly said. The European situation cannot be stable without the participation of the Soviet Union. But Chamberlain has never intended to do so. The European situation is currently a stalemate, and it will definitely be a tragedy in the future!</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper carried a speech by Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister during the European War, which further strengthened my belief. I fully agree with his observations. He believes that although the current British government is inviting small countries such as Romania, Greece, and Yugoslavia to join the anti-aggression group, it will be futile without the support of the Soviet Union. Therefore, he actively advocated: "If Britain and the Soviet Union establish a military understanding, and unite the strength of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and jointly resist any dictatorial country when it launches aggression, the effect will be incalculable." However, he also said: "If Britain and France do not provide practical guarantees and declare that they will not just talk, the Soviet Union will not cooperate." Yes, the Soviet Union is not stupid. Why bother to volunteer and do something thankless? Anyway, the smog in Central Europe will never stain its red flag!</p>
<p>This is the crux of the European situation: the Soviet Union does not participate in any collective action. This is the crux of the crux: Britain and France never want the Soviet Union to participate, so the Soviet Union is left to close itself off and live its life in a secluded paradise.</p>
<p>Why do Britain and France, especially Britain, do this? Do they really not know? No, no; they know very well. But they, especially Britain, as Lloyd George said, always think that with their efforts, everything can be solved easily, and there is no need to consult the Soviet Union. In addition, as I have repeatedly pointed out, they fear the Soviet Union more than they fear Germany and Italy. Therefore, they guard against the Soviet Union more than they guard against Germany and Italy. As for why they do this, the story is long, but to put it in a nutshell, it is just that their selfishness is too heavy and their vision is too short-sighted!</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American "Washington Post" also had a similar comment to Lloyd George. We can take it and learn from it to mutually enlighten.</p>
<p>The crux of the instability of the European situation lies here, and the crux of the instability of the world lies here. I do not have any preference for the Soviet Union, but I cannot help but shout: Without the Soviet Union, what will become of the European situation! Without the Soviet Union, what will become of the world!</p>
<h3>Marrying Off a Daughter</h3>
<p>— Ming Zhi</p>
<p>——The Story of the Old Grandmother</p>
<p>Since the last siege, there have been several attacks on Qingzhen. Although the captured towns cannot be garrisoned and must be abandoned, the purpose of depleting the enemy has been achieved. However, we also paid a small price. Wang Mingyuan and his group, along with other groups, sacrificed a total of 100,000 people, and 27 were injured, with varying degrees of light injuries, and lived in the most secluded places in various villages and homes.</p>
<p>This morning, medic Wei Bingcheng was very anxious and came to Wang Mingyuan to discuss. He said, "All the bandages and disinfectants are about to run out, but the place to get these medicines is 20 li away in Xiaozhen. There is no way to get them. What should we do?"</p>
<p>"Send two brothers to go. Wouldn't that be fine?" Wang Mingyuan suggested.</p>
<p>"But there are traces of devils everywhere between here and Xiaozhen, and they guard the canal that must be crossed even more tightly. How can we get back with those medicines on those bridges?"</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan scratched his head, and suddenly seemed to realize something, happily patted his thigh and said, "I have an idea! Let's ask the old grandmother to go!"</p>
<p>The old grandmother was feeding pigs behind the house. When she heard Wang Mingyuan calling her, she came out. Wang Mingyuan told her the whole story, and at the end added, "It's hard for you to dress up as a beggar again."</p>
<p>"No!" the old grandmother immediately replied.</p>
<p>"What? You don't want to?"</p>
<p>"No," the old grandmother smiled slightly, "First, according to the old method, we have to prevent people from seeing through it; second, this time there are more things and bigger things, and we can't carry them on our bodies. We must find another way."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes!" Wang Mingyuan had to admit. "But then what should we do?"</p>
<p>"You give it to me, I have a way. But you must give me thirty yuan. I have a place to use it."</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan handed her the thirty yuan without any doubt. Wei Bingcheng told her the place where the medicines were stored.</p>
<p>After lunch, the old grandmother and her son Ahe set off together. She changed her previous dress and wore brand new clothes and shoes, dressing up as a woman from a well-to-do family in the countryside. Ahe pushed the small cart, carrying her.</p>
<p>"You can have things by this time tomorrow." This was the old grandmother's parting words in the crowd's farewell.</p>
<p>They, mother and son, walked ten li or so and arrived at the North Bridge, which had to be crossed. Sure enough, there were several yellow-uniformed people guarding the east side of the bridge. The old grandmother got off the cart where she could see the yellow-uniformed people, and slowly led Ahe's cart towards the bridge.</p>
<p>In front of a yellow-uniformed person, in addition to bowing as usual, the old grandmother automatically unbuttoned her clothes a little, patted and shook them, indicating that she had nothing on her body, and Ahe spread his hands and let them check.</p>
<p>"Where to go?" stiff Chinese.</p>
<p>"To Qingzhen," the old grandmother said with a smile, her demeanor very calm, naturally giving people the power to believe her and not dare to offend her.</p>
<p>"What to do?"</p>
<p>"My daughter is getting married, so I'm going to buy some things."</p>
<p>"Where do you live?"</p>
<p>"Wangjia Village. Please come and drink wedding wine." It was a happy invitation.</p>
<p>The faces of the yellow-uniformed people all relaxed, and one of them waved his hand and said, "Go, go, come back early."</p>
<p>"I will definitely be back tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>They crossed the bridge and hurried to Qingzhen.</p>
<p>Qingzhen is very big, and within the scope of the evil forces, there is still an abnormal hustle and bustle. They used two or three hours to buy a lot of things, including two quilts, a pair of pillows, a chamber pot, a bucket, a washbasin, cooking oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and even toilet paper and soap, etc. For each item, they asked the store for an invoice, and the invoice had the seal of the "Qingzhen Autonomous Association."</p>
<p>As soon as they bought the things, they immediately loaded them on the cart, and in the twilight, they rushed to a small village near where Wei Bingcheng said.</p>
<p>When they arrived there, under the direction of the old grandmother, they invited several women and completed what she wanted to do.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, the old grandmother and Ahe set off back. The cart was full of things except for her seat.</p>
<p>On the west side of the North Bridge, they were again subjected to a search by the yellow-uniformed people. Before they could start, Ahe unloaded everything from the cart and spread it on the ground; before they could open their mouths, the old grandmother pointed to each item and told them:</p>
<p>"This is a quilt; this is a pillow;... this is a pot of soybean oil; this is a pot of soy sauce; this is salt;... these are soybeans, to grind tofu;... all bought in Qingzhen, to marry off my daughter." She also took out the invoice and showed it to them.</p>
<p>The yellow-uniformed people initially checked very seriously, but when they looked at each item, or weighed it in their hands, they felt that there was nothing suspicious, and then they gradually slackened off. At this time, the old grandmother picked up two more things and handed them to them, saying</p>
<p>"This is a pot of wine, to quench your thirst for a while; these are a few packs of cigarettes, to let you blow a few puffs."</p>
<p>When they accepted these things, there was actually a smile on their faces.</p>
<p>"Marrying a daughter... eating wedding wine..." they were learning with stiff tongues.</p>
<p>"Yes, please come to eat wedding wine," the old grandmother said with an extra smile, "in Wangjia Village, twenty li, very close."</p>
<p>In the wisps of smoke they blew out, Ahe re-packed everything and walked across the bridge with his mother.</p>
<p>"You come to eat wedding wine," the old grandmother? said to the yellow-uniformed people on the east side.</p>
<p>As soon as the old grandmother got on the cart, she walked very fast, and sure enough, at the time they left yesterday, they arrived home.</p>
<p>"What? You bought these things back?" Wang Mingyuan asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"Yes; I want to marry off my daughter!" As soon as she said this, she and Ahe laughed loudly.</p>
<p>"Marry off a daughter?" Except for their mother and son, everyone else didn't understand.</p>
<p>"You don't have to ask me, listen to me, you start working," the old grandmother ordered. "First, take apart the quilt."</p>
<p>They took it apart with seven hands and eight feet. Ah, the quilt core inside, except for a thin layer of cotton on the surface, was filled with bandages and rubber plaster in the middle. The other quilt was the same, and so were the two pillows. They understood; they could only laugh.</p>
<p>The old grandmother also directed them to pour the oil, wine, and other items in the pots into other utensils, and a bottle of disinfectant appeared at the bottom of the pots. There was more: under the sugar and salt, they picked out quinine pills and aspirin pills; under the soybeans, they picked out other useful medicines. And these sugar and salt, etc., were all placed in the newly bought buckets, washbasins, and even chamber pots.</p>
<p>"Old grandmother is really a genius!" Wei Bingcheng said, "These medicines can be used for some time."</p>
<p>"Which one is not useful?" Wang Mingyuan also praised and said, "Some are delicious, some are useful, and we should buy more."</p>
<p>"If there are more, we can't push it," Ahe also said with a smile.</p>
<p>Amidst the laughter, they put away everything.</p>
<p>At dinner, they drank the wine that they had obtained, and they were all very happy, cheering and saying:</p>
<p>"Old grandmother is marrying off her daughter, we are drinking, hahaha!..."</p>
<h3>Recover Our Homeland!</h3>
<h3>Nostalgia and Literati</h3>
<p>— Bao Xiaoyun</p>
<p>At present, almost everyone has this kind of nostalgic psychology, especially our literati.</p>
<p>Literati are people who can move their pens and write, and their status in the crowd is naturally "different," which is obvious. Therefore, everything they are nostalgic for is somewhat different from ordinary people.</p>
<p>When ordinary people often miss their hometown, they can't help but shout a few times, vent some complaints; or put on a bitter face to people, sighing for a while, and sighing for a while; and the more violent ones, can only slap the table and jump their feet, that's all. There is nothing fresher than that.</p>
<p>——But when it comes to our literati, it is not the same. In addition to complaining, jumping their feet, and sighing, they also have writing articles——articles with certain rules——this is something that ordinary people can't do. And it is also the best tool for nostalgia. So our literati can "boast" enough.</p>
<p>If someone really admires it very much, then you might as well call out a few times: "Great literati! Before the literati, there was nothing..."</p>
<p>Our literati are really omnipotent. When "inspiration strikes" and they think of their hometown, they wave a few strokes and write something like poetry, prose, ... There are so many patterns, it can be said that "everything is available," and they are all "perfectly exquisite"!</p>
<p>Sometimes our literati are happy and send their "masterpieces" to newspapers or magazines to be published, so that everyone can appreciate them.</p>
<p>Sometimes, maybe at the beginning of writing, they "frown," but when they finish writing the article, they will "smile happily" to avoid thinking about their hometown again. …</p>
<p>Too much idle talk, in order to "adapt to reality," let's pull it back and talk about current affairs.</p>
<p>Everyone knows: Now is the period of all-out war of resistance, so our literati's writing of nostalgic articles is also different from usual. Usually, writing some poems about "wind, flowers, snow, and moon," writing some "harmless" articles, seems to be okay;——but this is not acceptable today, so in order to cooperate with the war of resistance, no matter what kind of nostalgic article you write, it is best to drag it up to this, to show that our literati are not only nostalgic, but also nostalgic for the country!</p>
<p>From the above point, we can see that the spirit of our literati is indeed "advancing side by side" with the progress of the great era!</p>
<p>Also, what is worth mentioning and worth admiring is that the thinking of our literati seems to be very unified. Why? Because I have seen that nine out of ten articles about this kind of writing are "almost the same." Maybe the form is different sometimes, but the content is always "largely the same."</p>
<p>In short, nostalgia and literati have a close relationship, which no one can deny. They not only have "perfectly smooth" performance methods, but also have the power to make people "feel lingering"!</p>
<p>If there are idle people who, if they are happy, might as well spend some effort to compile all the articles of this kind since the war of resistance into a large series of books, like some essentials, some series, etc. I think there will definitely be business. Perhaps there is not enough capital at the time of publication, then you might as well start selling "pre-orders" and receive cash first, so that it seems that nostalgia can also make a fortune!</p>
<h3>Song from the Heart</h3>
<p>— Liu You</p>
<p>Morning, evening—while we are alive, our hearts always emit songs, never ceasing for even the shortest time.</p>
<p>This song, within our hearts, is the soul's high cry, the spirit's shout!</p>
<p>Although the song is beautiful, it is not always the same song!</p>
<p>Sometimes, the piercing sound is like the sorrowful cry of birds and beasts; the sobbing whisper is like the lament of ghosts; sometimes, the earth-shaking sound is like the roar of a tiger or lion, the shocking and fervent cry is like the struggle on a battlefield!</p>
<p>Song, this different song, never ceases.</p>
<p>But this song, even in its weeping, roaring, and frenzied cries, never loses its praise of justice.</p>
<p>No matter when, the song in our hearts constantly shouts: "We are human, we want to enjoy human rights!"</p>
<p>The devil's long howl, the ghosts' screams, cannot suppress the song of justice.</p>
<p>Weeping, shouting, this song from the heart, sings for the survival of humanity, this is greatness.</p>
<p>Song, the song from the heart, can never be silent!</p>

<h3>Securities: Unified A Exceeds 60 Yuan; Foreign Stocks Remain Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>The after-hours market for securities yesterday experienced a sudden and dramatic surge, with unprecedentedly good market sentiment. The A shares led the rise most strongly. Anyone with a little calculation knew that A shares were the best. It is evident from our newspaper that most people share this sentiment. Rumors circulated that certain parties had organized a bull company for A shares, but this remains to be verified. However, observing the overall trend, it appears that A shares are leading the way. As A shares rise, other types of shares follow suit. Talk of peaceful atmosphere is still just an embellishment, but the government's newly issued 60 million yuan of construction bonds, still set at 6% weekly interest and fully issued, has dispelled previous concerns about interest rate reductions. The unification of principal and interest of various government bonds is no longer in doubt. This has undeniably strengthened public confidence and provided considerable support for the new loans. Based on this observation, there may be abnormal developments in the future because the A shares have broken through the 60 yuan barrier. Buyers are constantly pushing up the price, which is indeed a good sign.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Tiansheng Jinwei was the strongest buyer, absorbing A shares at any time from beginning to end without any slackening. Yongkang Mao, Dadafeng, and No. 41 also took in shares successively. No. 4 and No. 13 also saw considerable absorption. Tongkang bought in the morning and sold in the afternoon, while Runli sold in the morning and bought in the afternoon. Tongde sold throughout the day. Lianhe Defu, Songmao Hengfu, and retail investors all released their long positions. The market still felt a shortage. A shares suddenly surged past the 60 yuan mark in the afternoon, and others mostly followed suit. As a result, all rose, by 7 jiao to 1.5 yuan. The rise in A shares was the most prominent. The total turnover was about 2 million yuan. A brief summary is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 200 shares of Hanyeping Company stock were traded at a price of 2.3 yuan.</p>
<p>Zhongye Company reported that investors and speculators continued to observe the situation, waiting for the European situation to ease before making decisions. Therefore, transactions were rare, but prices remained stable because the current market conditions were quite sustainable. There was renewed demand for corporate bonds, with large volumes traded. Rubber stocks remained weak, with few sellers, but if higher prices were seen, some sellers might release their holdings.</p>
<p>London British Far East Company stock market prices on the 13th of this month (Thursday) only saw the price of Mecca-Chun Bank continuing to shrink by 2 shillings and 6 pence, with the price at 7 pounds 17 shillings and 6 pence. There were no other changes. The trend remained sluggish, and prices saw little fluctuation. Only the public price of Chris Poole rose by half a pound, with the price at 37 pounds, while the British-German continued loan and British bond tickets continued to fall by one pound, with the price at 67 pounds. All others were unchanged. In the market, 5,000 pounds of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway bond was traded, with the transaction price at 26 pounds, an increase of half a pound according to the market. For the supply of British goods, there were 2,500 pounds each of the Huguang Railway Bond German-issued printed bond tickets and winning tickets and sought-after winning tickets, for a total of 5,000 pounds. The selling price was 21 pounds each, an increase of half a pound according to the market.</p>
<h3>Finance: Hong Kong Firms Resume Absorption; Spot Prices Rise Slightly—Approaching the 2,070 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot silver after-hours market saw an initially flat and then rising situation. Although a certain silver shop acted as an agent for Hong Kong firms to absorb silver in the morning, the amount was limited, and silver shops were still actively selling, resulting in a balanced supply and demand. Therefore, the situation was quite flat, with very few changes. However, in the afternoon, Hong Kong firms' desire to buy resumed, and sellers were mostly waiting and seeing, resulting in a slight upward price movement. As a result, the price rose by 5 yuan, and trading was thin. The total volume traded in the morning and afternoon was about 400 taels. There were no changes in silver ornaments. Sea gold remained flat. Sino-British pure gold, etc., moved downstream.</p>
<p>Spot silver after-hours market rises by 5 yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (10 taels) initially had few supplies or demands, causing a long period without any trading. It wasn't until after 10 o'clock that a money exchange shop sold 50 taels to a silver shop, with the opening price at 2,064 yuan, with no change from the previous closing price. After the opening, a silver shop bought 100 taels from a fellow shop at the same price of 64 yuan. Then, a silver shop did 50 taels with each other, the price was still 64 yuan. Later, a gold shop bought 50 taels from a silver shop for 65 yuan. More than half an hour later, a gold shop sold 50 taels to a silver shop, the price was also 65 yuan, it was already 11 o'clock. Later, due to a greater lack of supply and demand, no transactions were seen, causing the noon closing price to remain at 65 yuan. Afternoon trading was even quieter, and the price rose slightly because a certain silver shop resumed absorbing silver on behalf of Hong Kong firms. The sellers were waiting and seeing, so the market situation became firm. After 2:30, a silver shop bought 50 taels from a gold shop, the price was 69 yuan. Soon after, another 50 taels were bought by a silver shop from a gold shop, the price was the same. After this, no transactions were seen, so the late closing price remained at 2,069 yuan. As a result, the price rose by 5 yuan compared to the previous closing price. The full-day price difference was 5 yuan. The selling price of spot gold shops was 2,075 yuan, and the buying price was 2,065 yuan. The current standard gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were no transactions.</p>
<p>The exchange rate for ornaments has not changed</p>
<p>The exchange rate for silver shop ornaments has not changed. Datonghang is still maintaining the original price of 210 yuan, while Xintonghang is at 208 yuan, with a buying price of 202 yuan.</p>
<p>British pure gold suddenly shrinks by half a penny</p>
<p>A London dispatch on the 13th stated that the price of British pure gold suddenly shrunk by half a penny per ounce, falling to 7 pounds 8 shillings and 6 pence, causing the central bank's Chinese spot buying price to also decrease to 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed customs gold remained flat, at 2 yuan 3 jiao 9 fen 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also fell by 3 jiao, to 1,207 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<h3>British and American Exchange Rates: No Change; Hong Kong Exchange Rate Softens and Then Flattens</h3>
<p>The exchange market yesterday, although oil companies, Mobil, and major foreign firms had settlements, foreign firms such as HSBC were still willing to release funds and slightly did some inter-trading of US dollar for June, so the process was stable with few changes. As a result, there were no gains or losses and trading was still brisk. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, it was hard at the beginning, but then it softened because of the news that Hong Kong Telecom was very expensive, and eventually flattened out.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London big bar remained flat in the near term, and the long term fell by 0.0625. The New York silver price remained sluggish. London raw gold fell by half a penny. The exchange rates of British against US and against Shanghai were both flat. It was up four centimes against France. There were no changes in the US against British and Shanghai. It was up six-two-five against France. Central listings of various exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning selling price was 8 pence 25 for British exchange and 16 yuan 0625 for US exchange, with no changes from the previous closing. After the opening, foreign firms and certain banks hooked up with each other to buy British exchange but because HSBC was still willing to supply continuously, there were no changes. HSBC's listing was not moved. The White Silver Equalization Tax listing also showed no increase or decrease, still levying 5.00 percent. Afterwards, foreign firms continued to buy Dutch, Belgian, and British exchange at 8 pence 25, and also hooked up with a certain bank to trade US dollar at 16 yuan 0625 for June. As a result, the process remained unchanged. At that time, the situation of the Hong Kong exchange rate was quite hard. Foreign firms were willing to sell at 56 yuan 25, but soon because it was heard that Hong Kong Telecom was very expensive, it rose by (3125) against the British and ( )625 against the US, so the sellers' willingness to supply turned weak, and those who were shorting surged, causing the situation to change to softening. Near noon, foreign firms sold Hong Kong exchange at 56 yuan to foreign firms. By the time of the noon closing, the bank's selling price was the same as the morning opening.</p>
<p>In the aftermarket, foreign firms continued to hook up with HSBC to buy British exchange at 8 pence 25. Afterwards, oil companies, Mobil, and certain banks negotiated to trade US dollar at 16 yuan 0625. The situation was still quite sluggish. Afterwards, foreign firms also absorbed Hong Kong exchange at 56 yuan from certain Dutch banks. The situation was also flat. By the time of the late closing, the bank's selling prices were 8 pence 25 for British exchange and 16 yuan 0625 for US exchange. As a result, there were no gains or losses compared with the previous night's closing. The Hong Kong exchange rate also did not change.</p>
<h3>Gold Pound Sterling Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of British pure gold fell by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate did not change. Foreign exchange in this port was not in high demand from foreign firms, and the supply from banks was quite smooth. The market price was stable as before. The spot silver market opened steadily. Retail investors absorbed slightly. Transactions were sparse, and fluctuations were very narrow. The trend was slightly firm. In the afternoon, Hong Kong and Xiamen firms absorbed slightly. Gold shops and money exchange shops did not supply smoothly. The market price continued to rise. Many wealthy people threw out foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, but the market price still saw a slight increase. Foreign banks absorbed British and American gold notes quite strongly. Hong Kong notes were still in high demand, and the price was firm. Trading throughout the day was not brisk. Very few transactions were made by the guild. Only Xiangkang sold and Longchang bought US gold notes for 500 yuan. Yesterday's market prices were: British gold pound up 4 jiao, British gold note down 1 fen, US gold pound up 1 jiao, US gold note up 2 li, Hong Kong note up 7 li. All other currencies did not change.</p>

<h3>British Silver Futures Fall Back</h3>
<p>London, 13th Telegraph, The silver market slightly settled the transaction, and speculators sold futures, and the market was stable. The market was flat and firm after closing. Indian and Citibank merchants bought a small number at the listed price, but those who issued retained them.

Mumbai Electricity, the Indian silver market was calm, the spot price and April fell by one anna, and May did not change.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Drops Slightly Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange-cleared bill discount rate fell again. The discount rate of 1,000 yuan on the same day still hovered between 47 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen and 48 yuan. The final rate was 47 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen, which was 2 jiao 5 fen lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: 20-Count Double Horse Yarn: Stockpilers Take Profits; Market Price Fails to Continue to Rise with Coarse and Fine Yarn</h3>
<p>Yarn Market: Feels smooth. Although demand in the South is less than that in (omitted text), sporadic transactions are still uninterrupted. Furthermore, the Chaoshan, Hong Kong, and Yunnan regions have recently shipped a large amount of spot goods, so the recent yarn stock is not as loose as it used to be, and the market can be more stable. However, the 20-count Double Horse's rising but soft state is due to the strong consumption, but the production quantity is increasing, and the stockpilers have a strong hold on the goods. Many people are able to profit and sell when the market price rises, so the upward trend has not been actively advancing. The atmosphere in the afternoon of the previous day was exceptionally lively, and the market closed at the peak price. Judging from the past experience of the market, there was no doubt that the market would rise yesterday, but the material felt lower than the price of the previous day. Judging from this situation, the trend of the current yarn market is difficult to predict. In short, it is currently hovering in a solid state, and a new posture needs to be promoted by strong sales, which is difficult to achieve for a while. However, the buying interest in 10-count coarse yarn and 32-count and 42-count yarn is strong and rising.</p>
<p>Current yarn situation: Morning opening, due to rain, the gathering was later than usual, the market situation was flat and weak, the opening price fell by 1.5 yuan, the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 394 yuan. The actual demand was not as large as the previous day, and the domestic households who were active in the afternoon of the previous day did not come to absorb, saying that they were waiting for the market price to fall back a bit before re-energizing. There may be some fabrication in this. However, in fact, the 20-count yarn chips are still sufficient. Slightly tired in the middle, the Double Horse price did up to 392 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen, and then rebounded at the close. The opening in the afternoon turned to a tight phase, because the price was tired and few people were selling. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 394 yuan 5 fen to 5 yuan. The rising force of 42-count double-strand thread was even stronger. A total of 1,210 packages were purchased by various gangs throughout the day. The market price of 20-count Double Horse and Tiannv fell by 0.5 jiao to 1 yuan compared to the previous day. The price of 10-count group yarn was firm, but 42-count rose by 5 yuan. The factory opened 100 packages of 20-count Double Globe from Xinyu, with a price of 385 yuan. Today, 900 pieces of exported cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong, 380 pieces were transported to Guangzhou Bay, and 740 pieces were transported to Haiphong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Yunnan 80 Shantou 180</p>
<p>Inland 60 Fellow Traders 530</p>
<p>Wenzhou 25 Quanzhou 5</p>
<p>Jiangxi 75 Hong Kong 185</p>
<p>Fuzhou 45 Tianjin 25</p>
<p>Statistics 1,210</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market is still extremely chaotic, and the scene in the market is full of smoke. The prices quoted by brokers often differ by several yuan, which is not surprising. It is conceivable that the winnings and losses inside are huge. Yesterday's market price fell by a few yuan. The price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn for this month was 356.7 yuan. There is no real price opening for Shuiyueyun.</p>
<h3>US Agricultural Relief Fund: There is a Saying That It Will Increase to 400 Million Yuan; Lower-Grade Brazilian Cotton Rises by More Than Three Yuan Per Dan; About 500,000 Bales Have Been Imported From Outside in the Past Year</h3>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was more active yesterday. Shorts slightly covered positions, and fellow traders also traded slightly. Although there was no development news from Washington, Agricultural Secretary Henry Wells petitioned the government, requesting that members of Congress agree with his proposal to ask the government to increase the agricultural relief fund by 400 million yuan, so that cotton and wheat export subsidies could be realized, so that when the world needs raw cotton, loan cotton can take the opportunity to be sold out. This saying has a great impact on the future of cotton prices. Yesterday, New York rose slightly by 4 or 5 pounds, Indian cotton, including predictions, rose by one rupee, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 10 pounds. The exchange rate was flat. When converted into legal tender, the price of cotton was calculated as US cotton rose by 2 jiao, Indian cotton rose by 3 jiao, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 8 jiao.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton transactions, various factories slightly ordered Indian cotton, and Brazilian cotton transactions were also good, especially for lower-grade Brazilian cotton, because lower-grade Brazilian cotton that can spin 42 counts only sells for more than 73 yuan per dan, which is much cheaper than domestic cotton. Yesterday, a certain bank said that the difference between this lower-grade Brazilian cotton and the higher-grade cotton was too great, and they were deeply afraid that it would be difficult to buy in the future, so they sent a telegram saying that each dan would rise by more than 3 yuan. The converted cotton prices of yesterday are calculated as follows when sent to the factory.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Converted Market Price</p>
<p>There is still no development in the domestic cotton business. In fact, there is a shortage of goods. Although the factory has a way to identify it, there is no way to start, so the market has entered a standstill. Shenxin Factory bought 600 pieces of American-style baled cotton, aiming to take its color, which is white, bright, jade, and pure, to mix with Indian cotton for use. Other factories have no movement. Fellow traders are also helpless. The source of northern Jiangsu is blocked again, and it is withering. Only 70 packages arrived at the Tonghua wharf, and 93 pieces arrived in Beisha. Zhejiang cotton is also not allowed to be exported. There are still 20% to 30% of cotton stored in Changshu, Taicang, and other places, but bandits are very rampant in the countryside. Robberies are heard from time to time in transportation. For the sake of their capital, merchants stop moving forward. The cotton market is unimaginable in this chaotic situation. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>In addition, recently, China-England factories have successively (omitted text) the amount of coarse and fine yarn and thread that is close to 20,000 to 30,000 packages, which naturally needs to be replenished with raw cotton. Unfortunately, in this environment, where to start? Therefore, the lack of foreign cotton ordered from overseas must be supplemented to save the situation. According to a certain bank's news, recently, various parties have ordered more than 150,000 bales, each bale of Indian cotton (400 pounds), US cotton (500 pounds), and there is also a saying that from last year to the present, Chinese and foreign factories have purchased about 500,000 bales of foreign cotton, each bale is about 200 yuan in domestic currency, and the outflow of funds is about 100 million yuan.</p>
<p>Indian cotton is also being shipped. It is heard that the British ship Kachichi (transliteration), which will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow afternoon, has loaded 548 pieces of cotton from Mumbai, which will be unloaded at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Sales Continue Unabated; Sales in Local Stores Are Amazing</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday the market was firm, and the selling price was up without falling. This is because there is continued demand in South China, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, and Fujian. The Tianjin gang on the North Road is still actively handling printed cotton cloth. The local dyeing factory also absorbs grey cloth without any slackening. Even the sales volume of the local stores is maintained at an astonishingly high level. Moreover, many of the internal and external stockpilers are buying up various stocks to be sold in autumn and winter. The Tianjin gang has also started early to order six to seven months of woolen cloth and three hundred plus boxes of velvet cloth in July, August and September. Over a thousand boxes of printed velvet have been opened for sale by the local and Sichuan gangs. The original opening price was 2 jiao 8 fen 5 li per yard, but now it has risen to 3 jiao per yard. Yesterday's market showed little fluctuation. Yihua Golden Pagoda bleached cloth was purchased by the Fujian gang for dozens of boxes, and the inventory in the hands of fellow traders is gradually scarce. The price per bolt has been raised by 1 jiao and a half. The transaction of white coarse cloth turned smoother, and the local client gang completed 300 plus packages of transactions. Stockpilers also took in more than a hundred packages. The local dyeing factory purchased and dyed grey fine twill cloth for several hundred packages. Although the Ningbo gang in eastern Zhejiang has stopped operating, the demand in southern Jiangxi, Guangfeng, and Hekou is improving. Yesterday, they continued to handle miscellaneous cotton cloth patchwork pieces for one thousand plus several hundred bolts. The Wenzhou gang only handled coarse cloth, fine cloth, and white goods for fifty to sixty packages.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>The white goods market rose slightly. Yesterday, the demand from the local dyeing industry was strong, and they purchased various brands of fine cloth and fine twill for one thousand plus pieces. The North Gang, Tianjin, and Qingdao also handled more than 200 packages of fine cloth. The selling price was raised by about 5 fen per bolt. The shouting price for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth in the aftermarket must be 13 yuan, and the actual transaction price was 12 yuan 9 yuan 5 fen. Fellow traders' thoughts are particularly firm. That is, there are also many orders for colored serge and straight tribute. The current selling price of Four Gentlemen serge is 4 jiao 2 fen and a half per yard, and the mutual selling of futures is very lively.</p>
<p>Export</p>
<p>Today (omitted text) pieces of cloth and (omitted text) were transported to Shantou, 200 pieces were transported to Hong Kong, 100 pieces were transported to Guangzhou Bay, and 470 pieces were transported to Haiphong.</p>
<h3>Vienna Velvet Rises Sharply by More Than One Yuan</h3>
<p>Three-day Vienna velvet, due to the weather turning hot, the actual sales were creeping, resulting in an increase in the demand from buyers, and its standard market was quite high. Looking back at last year's selling price, it has risen sharply by more than one yuan per yard. According to the fixed rate, it is in short supply. There is a shortage of old stocks, and the cost of new goods has risen sharply, so the rising tide lifts all boats. Compared with other wool fabrics, the sharp rise is even more severe. Although there are many other fabrics that have risen by more than one yuan, they are all double-width. However, this single-width three-day Vienna velvet has risen sharply by more than one yuan. If it is calculated with double-width, wouldn't it have become a soaring of more than three yuan per yard? The momentum of the rise can also be said to be great. Yesterday, the wholesale spot price of Zhen San Tian Vienna velvet was 5 yuan 8 jiao net per yard. It was only sold for 4 yuan 7 jiao and a half last year, and 26 years before the war, it usually only sold for 3 yuan 6 jiao or 7 jiao.</p>
<h3>Grains: Foreign Flour Shouts Higher by Five Fen; Factory Flour Sells Well and Turns Stable; Local Wheat Trading Is Quiet Again</h3>
<p>Factory Flour: Gradually turning stable, the sales channels of customers have become active in recent days. The factories originally intended to compete with foreign flour, so they slightly accommodated the factory prices. Later, as the market price of foreign flour has been rising for several days, and the big firms holding the goods are unwilling to easily sell them, the factory prices have also tightened invisibly. The total market transaction volume of Chechuan and each brand of flour combined is five to six thousand bags. Apart from the seven or eight thousand bags of local retail sales, all were handled by the north and south gangs. The factory price of No. 2 flour is 4 yuan 4 jiao for both the local and customer parties, but the factory has already expressed an intention to shout higher.</p>
<p>On the 15th, 2,000 bags of flour were exported to Weihaiwei and 17,500 bags to Yantai.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour: Small scattered orders of foreign flour continue to arrive at the port. Since the Qingming Festival, wood customer transactions have been quite active. The major gangs, such as Yanjin and Qinhuangdao, have already handled and loaded quite a lot, mostly middle-grade brands of Citibank flour. Local customers continue to be active in the overall market, but the floating inventory on the market has gradually felt insufficient. The goods held in the hands of large firms are all intended to be sold when the price is right, so yesterday's spot and wholesale prices have all been shouted higher by 5 fen, including Bat, Double Eagle, and Golden Horse brands, totaling more than 24,000 bags, with a price of 4 yuan 3 jiao 5 fen (cleared by exchange). It is heard that old brands such as Red Sun and Dangtian are selling for 4 yuan 5 jiao and a half cleared by exchange. It is also heard that local retail sales are 4 yuan 3 jiao 8 fen, including delivery fees, delivered by spot cash. The current futures are difficult to approach, and people's hearts are quite solid. The market is unlikely to pass small for a while.</p>
<p>Local Wheat: Trading has become quiet again, because the newly arrived goods were sold out in an instant, the market's supply source is silent again, and the factory stomach is also in anticipation, so the market has stopped again.</p>
<h3>Japonica and Indica Sales Are Sluggish</h3>
<p>Market rumor new Saigon rice will arrive</p>
<p>Du Japonica: Yesterday, the source for each gang arrived at the riverbank for only 7 to 8 numbers, and the wheels wrapped two thousand plus bags. The local street and stockpilers' appetite is still sluggish. However, the sellers are quite firm in their thoughts due to the continued scarcity of arrivals and continuous rainy weather, so each commodity has very few transactions. The market is barely presented as a steady situation. If the thick and thin japonica and Duyang Jianpu and Jiantuo prices have not risen or fallen much, the road to change is also astringent, and the market color also bears a tired angle.</p>
<p>Customer Indica: Arrivals have been continuous in recent days, and the only way out is the local street. The market is full of selling pressure, and the market is gradually lowered. At present, peddlers are diligent in transportation, and people's hearts are even softer. Yesterday, the market of Jingwu and each indica continued to be a little one or two jiao, Nanjing Indica 12 yuan eight or nine jiao, Wu Jing Indica is only 12 yuan seven or eight jiao, and two thousand packages were traded. At present, at the time when customers are arriving in droves, there is still a rumor in the market that a new batch of Saigon rice will arrive, so the rear shape is not easy to return to the station. However, the spot of Saigon has been standing for a long time, and the high-quality pagoda brand is priced at seventeen and a half yuan, and the public bureau's repurchased goods are seventeen yuan two jiao and a half yuan.</p>
<p>It was found that 74 bags of corn were transported from Beisha yesterday, and 32 bags of beans were also transported.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Crude Soybean Oil Subject to Manipulation, Price Rises Again Yesterday by One or Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of soybean oil rose by one yuan, and peanut oil by two yuan. 30 pieces of Jiaozhou crude oil were traded (detailed market prices are listed in the market price section), as well as 50 baskets of Yantai crude oil, 900 cans of canned oil, 200 cans of Qingdao canned oil, and 10 barrels of barrelled oil. 800 dan of soybean oil from the Kai Suifeng Factory and 400 pieces of Yanqi oil were opened for trading, along with 80 pieces of Lianqi oil, another 100 large baskets, and 30 pieces of Fengnian oil. Currently, there are more than 300 barrels of Dalian oil available. The current market situation appears to be outwardly tight and inwardly strained, mainly because various sales markets, such as the Han River area, are also concentrated in Shanghai for procurement. This sometimes leads to a situation where one area is prioritized over another in terms of supply. Moreover, the source is also affected by controls, resulting in an unprecedentedly high record. Although the source is nominally controlled, supplies still arrive secretly and continuously. Therefore, the balance of market tightness is entirely manipulated by others, and the market can only be at the mercy of others. Yesterday, at the close of the market, there were rumors that Japanese merchants had opened a forward oil price of 41 yuan, but this has not yet been confirmed. Currently, the spot oil price in Dalian is around 17 yuan, plus additional expenses, which results in a cost that is 20 yuan higher than the selling price in Shanghai. With such a huge profit margin created artificially, how could ambitious speculators not pay attention to it? Therefore, peanut oil also cannot escape this stage. Future potential trends and changes are indeed numerous.</p>
<p>Among oil products, 3,009 pieces of branch and skin oil arrived from Wenzhou yesterday, and 990 pieces of tea oil also arrived.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Raw Silk Opens at 1,100 Yuan, Exceeding the Previous Increase Record; Shanghai Factories Also Rise by 50 Yuan</h3>
<p>The foreign silk market continued its upward climb yesterday. New York recent futures rose by four points, and distant futures rose by three and a half points. Spot raw silk in China and Japan each rose by three points. Total transactions for the entire city amounted to 1,480 dan, which can be described as a boom in both price and sales. Judging from this, the US market may rise again in the near future. Yesterday, the Lyon silk market saw Japanese silk rise by three francs, Shanghai silk A-grade rise by two francs, B-grade rise by one franc, and Guangdong silk remain unchanged. The Yokohama silk market saw spot prices rise by ten yuan, opening at 1,100 yuan, and distant futures rise by six yuan, with the trend remaining good.</p>
<p>The local silk market in Shanghai also rose accordingly yesterday. Unfortunately, foreign firms were still demanding high prices, resulting in sluggish transactions. White factory B-grade silk was sold at an opening price of 1,650 yuan yesterday, with 78% quality selling for 1,670 yuan. In the afternoon, there were also transactions at an opening price of 1,680 yuan. Most transactions were for the near term, while May and June futures seemed more stagnant. Furthermore, these prices were about 10 to 20 yuan higher than the previous day. High-grade white factory 20-22 denier silk continued to be traded yesterday, at a price of 1,800 yuan, up 50 yuan from the previous market. However, the volume of transactions was not large and limited to spot goods for this month only. Overall, the Chinese and foreign silk markets experienced a gradual rise throughout the week, culminating in a sharp surge. Moreover, the price of Yokohama silk has exceeded the record of the previous price surge. Therefore, while the Japanese and US silk markets are currently strong, looking back at previous experiences, the current high price record seems to be approaching its limit. Generally, price increases and decreases that exceed normal levels are determined by only two factors: first, a sudden change in supply and demand, and second, a sudden change in currency value. Other factors, such as speculative manipulation and creating disturbances, will inevitably lead to a market reaction. This is because of the lack of a solid foundation.</p>
<p>Tea imports: 104 pieces arrived from Hong Kong on the 14th, and 149 pieces arrived from Wenzhou.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports: Fresh Eggs and Pottery Arriving Continuously</h3>

There were also 617 pieces of tobacco leaves from Wenzhou, and 4,970 pieces of pottery from Shantou. In addition, 22 pieces of fresh eggs came from Beisha and 2,645 pieces from Wenzhou. On the 15th, 100 pieces of egg yolk and white were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Transportation and Shipping Weekly</p>
<h3>Overview of Changxing Company (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Deng Bingquan</p>
<p>Changxing Company (Canadian Pacific Steamship &amp; Railways) has long been a leader in Pacific shipping. The company's General Manager, Mr. H.B. Beaumont, is capable and accomplished, making this great enterprise a reality and is deeply admired by people around the world. I once met Mr. Beaumont during his travels in the Far East and deeply admire him. Recently, I saw an article written by Mr. Beaumont himself, which I have translated as follows:</p>
<p>Changxing Company's trans-Pacific services began in 1891. Currently, the ships on this route include the Empress of Japan, with a total weight of 26,000 tons, the Empress of Canada, with a total weight of 21,500 tons, the Empress of Russia, with a total weight of 16,800 tons, and the Empress of Asia, with a total weight of 16,900 tons. Every two weeks, one ship sails between Vancouver, Victoria, and various ports in the East.</p>
<p>The Empress of Japan and the Empress of Canada follow the route from Vancouver, via Victoria, Honolulu, Yokohama, Kobe, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Manila, before returning to England. The Empress of Russia and the Empress of Asia sail from Yokohama, Kobe, Nagasaki, Shanghai, Hong Kong, to Manila, before returning to England. The distance from Vancouver to Manila via Honolulu is 8,458 miles, requiring 21 days of sailing.</p>
<p>Changxing Company's ships crossing the Pacific dominate passenger traffic between Seattle, the Pacific coast northwest of Vancouver, and Victoria, far surpassing other competing ships traveling between these ports. In addition to these strong transportation positions, the following points can prove that Changxing Company's Pacific services are indeed the best: (1) The Empress of Japan holds all the fastest trans-Pacific records, (2) The Empress of Russia and the Empress of Asia are the fastest ships sailing directly between the Pacific coast and Japan.</p>
<p>Since December 1929, Changxing Company's Empress-class ships crossing the Pacific began calling at Honolulu. This is an important change in the company's Pacific business, increasing traffic between Vancouver and Honolulu, as well as between Honolulu and the East. Statistics confirm that calling at Honolulu was a strong factor in Changxing Company's revenue growth during the recent years of economic downturn.</p>
<p>Since 1893, Changxing Company's ships began connecting with the South Sea Islands, New Zealand, and Australia. The first ship to operate on this line was the Miowera, with a total weight of 3,393 tons, sailing from Vancouver to Sydney, Australia, via Victoria, Honolulu, and Suva. Subsequently, the tonnage of ships changed, but the business on this line, continuing to Auckland, New Zealand, has not changed to this day. In 1931, the Niagara, with a total weight of 13,415 tons, and in 1925, the Aorangi, with a total weight of 17,491 tons, joined this line of navigation. No additions have been made since. Now, it sails once every four weeks. The distance from Vancouver to Sydney is 7,639 miles, requiring 23 days of sailing.</p>
<p>In Canada and the United States, Changxing Company entrusts the Canadian Pacific Railway Company as its transportation agent. In Fiji, New Zealand, and Australia, it entrusts the Union Steam Ship Company as its transportation agent. However, in the East, including Tokyo, Yokohama, Kobe, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Manila, it has its own offices, with Hong Kong overseeing a large area of passenger shipping in the East, including Japan, Korea, Manchuria, China, the Philippine Islands, the Dutch East Indies, Borneo, French Indochina, Siam, the Federated Malay States, Burma, Ceylon, and India. In areas south of Hong Kong, it does not have its own offices, but has agents. When normality is restored, it may set up its own offices in one of the main centers of India or Singapore.

<h3>Detailed Records of Inland Highways</h3>
<p>— Jing Xun</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the construction of highways in inland China has been progressing rapidly. International highways include the Yunnan-Burma-Ceylon Highway, the scale of which is truly astonishing. In the southwestern and northwestern provinces, the density of highways is also commonly seen by the Chinese people. In other coastal provinces, such as Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Zhejiang, highway construction is also developing rapidly day by day. Since inland transportation is entirely dependent on highways, the general public is still largely unfamiliar with the experience of traveling on highways. The purpose of writing this article is simply to describe the detailed conditions of various inland highways, such as mileage, fares, and accommodation along the way, in order to facilitate travel. Before writing the main text, I would like to provide a few points to note when traveling on highways for reference:</p>
<p>When traveling to the interior, the less luggage you carry, the better, but it is virtually inevitable that travelers carry luggage. To avoid trouble on the journey, it is best to carry as little as possible. The regulations of inland highway authorities regarding luggage carried by passengers are generally uniform. Each person is allowed to carry a free baggage allowance of 20 kilograms. For baggage exceeding the free allowance, the charge is 4.6 to 5 cents per kilometer per 5 kilograms. If there is too much baggage, the baggage fee can be quite astonishing, and highway authorities often refuse to allow passengers with excessive baggage to board. At that time, it will be difficult to advance or retreat, so it is best to plan in advance. Furthermore, luggage and passengers are transported separately on highway buses. At the back of each bus, a section is set aside in a concave shape, which will be used to store luggage; therefore, before departure, in addition to larger luggage (mostly trunks, bedding, etc.), a small handbag or rattan bag is indispensable. It is advisable for the bag to be 24 inches long and 18 inches wide, with some daily necessities placed inside, which can be easily opened and used frequently without having to open the large luggage. The seats on highway buses generally number eighteen per vehicle, with the seat next to the driver being the most comfortable. If you sit in the rear of the bus, you are likely to suffer from bumps. The seats in the car are so crowded that once the bus departs, passengers cannot move. Therefore, a mouthwash cup and towel should be kept handy for spitting or vomiting due to motion sickness. Other items such as flashlights, water bottles, and medicines are all essential for travel. At the same time, an identity certificate is very important when traveling in the interior, because it is necessary to undergo inspection when entering the provincial borders of a certain province, and having that thing can facilitate a lot. The situation of each highway is described below:</p>
<p>(A) Southwest Highways The southwest provinces, including Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Xikang, are at the core, with Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, and Hunan as the outer circle. In addition to railways such as the Xiang-Gui, Yue-Han, Xiang-Qian, and Xu-Kun, there are four major trunk roads: from Chongqing in Sichuan in the north, via Guiyang, to Kunming in the west, and to Liuzhou in the south to reach Guilin. From these trunk roads, you can transfer to many branch roads in each province, and the scale of transportation is quite large.</p>
<p>(II) Kunming to Guiyang Kunming is more than 1,900 meters above sea level, with a mild climate. The busier streets are Zhengyi Road and Jinbi Road. The Kunming Business Hotel established by the China Travel Service has excellent facilities. Other lesser hotels include Deyichun, Xinsheng, and Changxin. Prices are approximately 1.2 yuan per day for a single room and 2.4 yuan for a double room. The Youth Hostel seems to be the most suitable, but it does not often have vacant rooms. From Kunming to Guiyang, the distance is 662 kilometers, and it takes three days to reach Guiyang by highway bus. On the first day, depart from Kunming to Pingyi. This distance is 237 kilometers, and the journey takes about eight hours. Lunch is taken in Qujing, and the night is spent in Pingyi; Pingyi has a special reception center of the China Travel Service, Pingyi Hotel, which costs only 7 jiao for one night and two meals. Pingyi is the last inspection point in Yunnan. On the second day, depart from Pingyi to An'nan. This distance is 183 kilometers, and it is necessary to pass through the "Twenty-Four Zigzags," which is quite dangerous. The so-called "Twenty-Four Zigzags" means that the bus climbs a high mountain, opening upwards in a "zigzag" pattern, a total of twenty-four times in a row. Therefore, it takes nine and a half hours for the bus to reach An'nan. Lunch is taken in Pan County, and the night is spent in An'nan. An'nan has a reception center of the China Travel Service, with single rooms costing 1.5 yuan, double rooms costing 2 yuan, berths costing 7 jiao, and extra beds costing 5 jiao. The cost per meal is 5 jiao. On the third day, depart from An'nan to Guiyang. This distance is 242 kilometers, and the journey takes about eight hours. Lunch is taken in Anshun. It is necessary to pass through Huangguoshu, the location of the world-famous waterfall, which is very spectacular. Although Guiyang is on flat ground, it is surrounded by mountains, so it is actually still a valley. The city is not as prosperous as Kunming, and prices are very expensive. The hotel has a reception center entrusted by the Guizhou Provincial Government to the China Travel Service, with prices of 2 yuan per room. The cost per meal is 5 jiao. Other hotels include the Guizhou Hotel, but the facilities are very simple. From Kunming to Guiyang, the free baggage allowance per person is 20 kilograms. The charge for excess baggage is 1.986 yuan per 5 kilograms. The itinerary from Guiyang to Kunming is the opposite. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Transportation Still Convenient</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is an important route into the interior. Since the fall of Nanchang, the road was suddenly interrupted, but it can still be operated in sections as usual. The eastern section can reach Guixi, Jiangxi, more than 300 kilometers away from Jinhua. The train schedule is not fixed. The fare for the third class is 5.5 yuan, and the second class is double that. The first class is double again. This journey takes about ten hours. After arriving in Guixi, you can find a way to take the highway to Ji'an. (The situation of this highway will be described in detail after accurate investigation). The Jiangxi Provincial Highway Bureau has a bus departing from Ji'an to Jiehualong every day, which can be reached on the same day, with a fare of 8.69 yuan. From Jiehualong, you can transfer to a Hunan provincial highway bus directly to Hengyang, with a fare of 11.65 yuan. Staying overnight in Chaling is quite convenient. As for the western section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, trains can run from Yichun to Zhuzhou, taking about six hours, with a third-class fare of 3.65 yuan. From Zhuzhou, you can take the Yue-Han Railway to Hengyang, which is only 137 kilometers away, taking about six hours, with a third-class fare of 1.75 yuan. The train schedule for the Hengyang-Guilin section of the Xiang-Gui Railway from Hengyang to Guilin remains unchanged for the time being. It is also quite convenient to transfer to the interior from here.</p>

<h3>Reliable Proof of the Effectiveness of Bosch Spark Plugs</h3>
<p>According to a reliable survey, Bosch spark plugs were equipped in the cars that won the championship and created records in 159 international car races held in 1938 and 17 world speed records. Bosch spark plugs have been known for their economy, durability, and reliability for many years. The above survey is another solid proof of its reliability. Bosch spark plugs are managed by Jebsen &amp; Co., Ltd. in this city. It is said that the company has shipped a large batch of new products, and the price is quite reasonable. All automotive parts stores in this city sell them.</p>
<h3>Travel Inquiries</h3>

<p>Wu Dili, Hu Fanzhong, Meng Meisun, and Tan Zhesheng asked about the traffic situation from Shanghai to Chongqing and Chengdu:</p>
<p>Answer: (1) The minimum travel cost from Shanghai to Chongqing via Vietnam is about 139 yuan. The cost of food and lodging along the way, calculated at the lowest rate, is about 70 yuan per person. (2) The highway bus fare from Chongqing to Chengdu is 21.6 yuan. (3) It is faster to apply for a passport in Hong Kong. If you want to entrust the China Travel Service in Shanghai to apply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Chongqing, it will take about a month. As for the identity certificate, it must be issued by the organization you work for. (4) The highway between Kunming and Xufu only transports goods, and there are no buses running.

<p>Yu Boyun, Zhang Ruxin, Chen Liangjie, Shen Jinbiao, Yang Liangcheng, and others asked about going to the interior without detouring through Vietnam:</p>
<p>Answer: (1) You can take a ship from Shanghai to Shantou, with a minimum fare of 16 yuan. After arriving in Shantou, take the train to Chaozhou, with a fare of 7 jiao for third class. Then, take the highway through Yuning, Longnan, and arrive in Qujiang (i.e., Shaozhou), which takes about three days for the entire journey. The travel cost is about 20 yuan, but it is said that there is a severe shortage of highway buses, and it is impossible to know whether there are buses running daily. After arriving in Qujiang, you can take the Yue-Han Railway train to Hengyang, with a third-class fare of 3.95 yuan, and then take the Xiang-Gui Railway to Guilin to transfer to Guiyang, Chongqing, and other places. If you want to go to Lian County in Guangdong, you can transfer from Shaozhou by highway (fare details not available). If you take the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway train from Jinhua to Guixi, Jiangxi (third-class fare is 5.5 yuan), and then take the highway from Guixi via Ji'an to Hengyang (train schedule and fare details not available), you can also transfer to the interior. Neither of the above two routes has been fully confirmed. We will report again after accurate investigation.</p>

<p>Answer: (1) There are direct ships from Shanghai to Fangcheng, with a minimum fare of 37 yuan per person. (2) All expenses after arriving in Haiphong are paid in Vietnamese currency. This Vietnamese currency can be exchanged at the Qian Zhuang on Sichuan Road in this city, with each Vietnamese currency worth about 1.7 yuan in domestic currency. (3) There is no physical examination when landing in Haiphong. Trachoma is not a problem. Although there is no difficulty in carrying daily books, it is best to handle them in Hong Kong, which is faster. If you do not have a guarantor but have a supporting document from the institution, you can entrust the China Travel Service in Hong Kong to handle it. The company may be able to find a way. If you entrust the China Travel Service in Shanghai to send a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Chongqing to apply, it will take one month to receive it, with a fee of 8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Xi'an to Lanzhou</h3>
<p>— Bao Cheng</p>
<p>Considering the Northwest Highway, there are seven lines in total: Sichuan-Shaanxi, Xi'an-Lanzhou, Lanzhou-Qin, Lanzhou-Xing, Gansu-Qinghai, Xi-Jing, and Han-Bai. The main lines should be the Xi'an-Lanzhou and Sichuan-Shaanxi lines. The Sichuan-Shaanxi line runs from Chengdu, Sichuan, directly to Xi'an, Shaanxi, with a total length of more than 800 kilometers, taking four days, and is an important route connecting the west, south, and north. The Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway is the only trunk road in the northwest, starting from Xi'an, Shaanxi, passing through Xianyang, Liquan, Bin County, Jingchuan, Pingliang, Longde, Jieshipu, Huajialing, Dingxi, and other places, reaching Lanzhou, Gansu, with a total length of about 700 kilometers, taking about four days. The scenery along the way is magnificent and different from the situation in the southwest. This road is currently under the jurisdiction of the Northwest Highway Administration of the Ministry of Communications. Since its opening to traffic, passengers have found it convenient. Since last year, the Highway Administration has agreed with the China Travel Service to handle food and lodging stations and passenger and freight transportation along the way. The reception centers that have been established are in Bin County, Pingliang, Huajialing, and Lanzhou. In the future, it will be improved depending on the situation of the passengers. The Northwest Highway Bureau has revised the passenger ticket prices from March 1st, which are calculated at 4.5 cents per passenger per kilometer. Starting from Xi'an, stay in Bin County on the first day, Pingliang on the second day, Huajialing on the third day, and Lanzhou on the fourth day. However, recently, vehicles have often been lacking, so the train schedule cannot be accurate, which leads to the failure to stop at the prescribed places for food and lodging along the way, which is its shortcoming. It is said that the Northwest Highway Bureau is currently striving to develop, and in the future, it will grasp the hub of northwest transportation, connecting Gansu with the outside world. The mission of transportation is important, and the future should not be ignored.</p>
<h3>Pengcheng No. 60 Car and Delivery Truck</h3>
<p>Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>The Pengcheng No. 60 car Bantam "60" and delivery truck are produced by the Pengcheng Automobile Factory in the United States; they are welcomed by people all over the United States and the world for being the most economical and practical. The Pengcheng No. 60 is no different from the modern popular general cars except for its smaller size; and its design and engineering are both perfect. Generally, there is no car that is better than the Pengcheng. Its parts are strong, durable, excellent, and outstanding, and it is also suitable for assembling on larger and heavier vehicles. Furthermore, because the Pengcheng is smaller in size, the assembly of various parts is more compact and accurate, thus extending its life and making it extremely economical. The consumption of oil is reduced, the performance of the engine is increased, and the gasoline mileage reaches a surprising 42 to 56 miles per gallon, which is unmatched in terms of economy. The style of the Pengcheng delivery truck is also very beautiful. It can be used to transport goods and has an advertising effect, which can help promote business.</p>
<p>It is reported that this new car has been shipped by the dealer Lux Automobile Company at 101 Albert Road in this city and will arrive in the city soon. The company is renovating the sample room and actively arranging it for displaying the new car.</p>

<h3>How Can Prostitutes and Politicians Compare to Elementary School Students?</h3>
<p>— Ren Yong</p>
<p>A few days ago, various newspapers in this city published Mr. Wu Jingheng's eloquent and critical article. Mr. Wu's articles are typically lively and touching, and this time, he was righteously and sternly criticizing a prostitute-politician, making it even more moving.</p>
<p>In the middle of this article, Mr. Wu repeatedly said to the traitor Wang: "Even elementary school students know this!" or "Even elementary school students understand this!" The implication was: "How can you (Wang) be worse than an elementary school student?"</p>
<p>Indeed, Wang Jingwei, who once sang passionately, "Taking up the knife for a swift death, not failing my youthful head," has now become so muddled. No wonder Wu Zhi Lao had to say, "How can you be worse than an elementary school student?"</p>
<p>But the reality is before our eyes: the Wang Jingwei of today cannot compare to elementary school students. We might as well cite examples as evidence. I remember a long time ago, a news story reported that some × army had captured one of our young compatriots. They wanted him to write the four characters "Long live the Imperial Army," and at the same time, someone was taking pictures of this scene with a camera. Who knew that this great little hero, without panic, picked up a pen and wrote a line of large characters: "Down with ×× Imperialism!" Then, the butcher's sharp knife pierced the little warrior's burning chest, and he died unyieldingly for his country. Although this was only eight characters, it was actually better than Wen Tianxiang's magnificent thirty-rhyme "Song of Righteous Spirit." This was naturally an elementary school student; how could Wang Jingwei compare to even a ten-thousandth of him!</p>
<p>We once saw another great news story reported in the newspaper: In the northern district of this city, there was a certain elementary school near a certain puppet organization. One day, a group of shameless people went to visit. In one classroom, all the elementary school students stood up and shouted at this group of shameless people: "Down with the traitors!" "Down with ××!" Although this elementary school could no longer continue because of this and was moved away overnight, stopping operations, the scene was truly magnificent. Dozens of little voices indeed frightened the running dogs and terrified the enemy! How could Wang Jingwei compare to even a ten-thousandth of this!</p>
<p>The mad pressure of cannons and sharp knives has tempered our elementary school students to be no different from adult warriors. They already understand very well: who are our enemies, and who are the shameless running dogs? But Wang Jingwei, who closes his eyes today, I dare say he certainly doesn't understand this. So, how can he compare to our group of clear-minded, loyal, and brave elementary school students?</p>
<p>Therefore, while everyone reads Mr. Wu Jingheng's great work and curses the shameless prostitute-politicians, we also hope that everyone will not look down upon our elementary school students. We must learn, learn from this group of brave and great elementary school students!</p>
<h3>Regarding "The First and the Last"</h3>
<p>— Wu Ren Zhi</p>
<p>—Confessions After Directing—</p>
<p>The performance of "The First and the Last" on the experimental week carries some research posture of drama itself. Of course, so-called the research of drama itself, is definitely not to be separated from times, society, and life, but just to discuss drama skill. As "no life, no drama" is true, we might as well say: no times, no society, no drama. This is the essence of drama. While doing the research of drama itself, we will never forget its essence. This time I'm very honoured, the organizing committee gave me "The First and the Last" to direct, I should write some report. But, it is ashamed, not polite, truthfully, rather than provide research material, I would rather write some confession, to supply some materials for criticism. Isn't it? It seems more appropriate this way.</p>
<p>My understanding of the main point of the play: "The First and the Last," the author is educating us, making us understand the essence of the times, the essence of social low law. He raised an example here: the law is protecting the money of corpse, but not sympathizing the thief (an old man) "who committed the crime for starving". Zhonghua said: "let me be as stone hearted as brother Borong… let's just forget everything ourselves… this is the world of brother." And how about his brother Borong? He repeatedly said to Wang Xiaomei: "I will plan with Zhonghua first, then I will plan with you." Of course, the relationship between people has the difference of kinship. Here, it is shown that the law is just that. Suberna said well: "you don't see law as natural as the cold of weather" "if you don't participate, they will divide your benefit, nothing left. Because they have to take care of themselves." However, Zhonghua pulled Xiaomei along to die after all. He said "we are not born to live in this world. Weak, no intention, it's better to die than to live." This is author's cleverness, he knows nobody wants to die like that. Galsworthy is educating us!</p>
<p>Based on the starting point of above statement, my understanding of the characters in the drama is as follows: Borong is a certain type of ruler. And Zhonghua is his most suitable opponent - the ruled. Wang Xiaomei here, although the play is important, is just a tragic contrast.</p>
<p>"The First and the Last" is a one-act three-scene two-scene play. Each scene is closed, and the middle of the third scene has to be curtained once (now replaced by "dark change"). It is a small three-act play in form, but there are only three characters. Directing this play is tasty enough. But it is also really difficult. In the first scene, there are only two people throughout, and there is no up and down scene, and the performance area is subject to the limitation of the light field. What I worry about most here is: whether the adjustment of the actors' positions is appropriate; whether the air can be not relaxed all the time. In the second and third scenes, what I worry about most is: whether the stage surface is appropriately viewed, the bed and door should be placed in a prominent position, and the window should be suitable for taking light; whether the mood is tight enough; whether the lighting and effects are matched, because it is not entirely according to the control of the original script. These, what I worry about most, are not what I feel satisfied with, and also what I hope to correct with high levels. We have a feeling for Dao Wei, that is, it is good, although good will not be absolute; but if it is not good, it will fail terribly, as if this play does not allow staying in a flat state. Therefore, good is necessary, and failure is my fault that cannot be escaped.</p>
<h3>Blood Splatters in a Brothel</h3>
<p>— Yan Hua</p>
<p>“While New York Sleeps”</p>
<p>A 20th Century Fox Production, Showing at Cathay Theatre</p>
<p>"Blood Splatters in a Brothel," in terms of style, follows the new detective comedy line of "The Thin Man" and "Phantom Killer." Therefore, the entire film consistently showcases the inherent characteristics of comedy, allowing the audience to experience the flavor of witty humor amidst suffocating tension. The screenwriter is not only very successful in this regard, but also the director in terms of atmosphere, emotion, and sound effects has achieved superior accomplishments. Therefore, although there are no dazzling stars in the entire film, we truly hold "Blood Splatters in a Brothel" in high regard.</p>
<p>The content of this script is no different from general American detective films. It still writes about how gangsters, thugs, and lawless people in American nightclubs commit robberies and assassinations, and finally, the case is solved, and the criminals are brought to justice.</p>
<p>In terms of violent exposure, this kind of film seems to be slightly better than the old tunes that general writers specialize in writing about deviant love and erotica, because at least they point out that there is such human nature existing in such a society. However, the writers' vision only extends this far. They have no time to further point out how many new young people have fallen into this dark and illegal circle in such an environment. We should thoroughly eradicate this unfortunate phenomenon (it's not just a matter of shooting them to death in general G-MAN films). We must find the basis for the existence of such human nature and the factors that make them active in this society, and then we can educate them very educationally and eliminate their tendency to grow vigorously in this money-oriented society.</p>
<p>In terms of writing methods, "Blood Splatters in a Brothel" focuses on the capable news reporter. Like "Phantom Killer" and other films, it emphasizes the high strength of these news reporters' ability to interview and investigate, so that cases that even the police detective shrink away from, through his sharp and alert investigation, the whole case is cleared up. In the middle of this, a small love interlude is also inserted, but the writer of this film does not seem to have fallen into the old set. That is, after the news reporter spent a lot of effort to rescue a singer who was involved in a major suspect (he regarded her as a love object), he fully wanted to be engaged to her, but she left with her changed man, and also said some words to him that she would never forget him. This kind of silent and novel ending seems to have more aftertaste than the "happy ending" of general films.</p>
<p>The writer is extremely successful in grasping the characters' personalities. Writing Zuo Yi's joyful protection, as Zhu Di's false shooting as a result of really being killed, the front and back echoes are very powerful: writing Zuo Yi's assistant Neilson is sinister and silent, until the end he jumped out and claimed to be the murderer, all are extremely concise.</p>
<p>The director's emphasis on creating jokes is indeed very successful, and even the two most important scenes are also calm and superior, such as (1) The scene of Zhu Di's false killing of Zuo Yi, the high singing and revelry of the outside dance hall, the sound of bursting balloons falling from the air, the young Barney (i.e., the news reporter) just walked into the door, inside a gunshot sounded, pushing the door, Zhu Di with a gun in hand, Zuo had fallen to the ground, but secretly opened one eye to peep and smile; (2) When solving the case: everyone is checking the stock, Barney brought a photography reporter in, pointing a gun at everyone, satirical shadow, the photography reporter retreated, himself took out the gun and said the killing process, Zuo Yi's lover shot Ni in the back, Ni fell to the ground,... The detective leader hurriedly pushed the door in. The application of these two sound effects.</p>
<p>The male lead, Magal Lun, who plays the news reporter, is not bad, and the female lead, Jean Rogers, is also a new star, and both are very capable of acting.</p>

<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianmei</p>
<p>Episode 8: Is It Illusion or Reality? Playing a Role. Should I Proceed or Stop? Burial Grounds Everywhere.</p>
<p>How is America changing its style? Because the world is gradually becoming more practical, it is no longer solely using eroticism and luxury as a means to guide the audience. Those women's legs, after looking at them, make people tired of looking. Which young woman doesn't have two legs? Whose young woman's legs aren't smooth and shiny? Looking at these legs, can it really satisfy the audience's lustful eyes? Singing and dancing in musical films is fine to watch occasionally, but if you watch them often, it's just changing the soup without changing the ingredients, always these few tricks, and it doesn't feel meaningful. Therefore, Hollywood has recently been gradually reducing films that sell female stars' bodies and movies that make people increase their sensuality. Comic films, of course, are still popular, but comedy needs to have a deep meaning, a meaningful comedy, not a meaningless comedy. As for our Chinese film industry? In the new undertaking, film is also very developed. Under the National Propaganda Committee of the Central Government, there is a Film Bureau, and in addition, various cultural institutions often have film groups. There are many other private film companies. Generally, North China is in Beijing, Central China is in Shanghai, and South China is in Guangzhou, all of which are major production bases for films. But a government agency examines everything, not allowing for shoddy manufacturing, and instead vigorously promotes films about science. I will now talk about the films shown in the East China University's theater. Whether they are foreign or domestic, most are science-related. Some are free, specifically shown to teachers and students. Others require payment because there are expenses associated with the source of these films, so a small ticket price must be charged. If there is any surplus after expenses, it will be used for public welfare in the school. Not only films are like this, but also plays, often for the sake of public welfare expenses, a small ticket price can be charged. But this one or two times a year, or the public performance on commemorative days, is the trial performance of the Drama Research Association of their student union, which has never charged ticket fees. What is performed? Are also their own scripts, directed by themselves, and have never been performed elsewhere. However, after those scripts are performed by them, they also spread throughout the country. Many other drama troupes, with the permission of East China University, perform their scripts. Approximately every year, East China University must have two or three scripts that are popular at home and abroad, known as the East China School scripts. This time, the script being performed is called "Traces of Shanghai on the Xiang River," which is a tragedy in five acts. It was written by a professor in the College of Liberal Arts of East China University, and selected several students with theatrical talent to rehearse for a month, and continued to test it today.

<h3>Radio Musings</h3>
<p>— (Ni Qiuping)</p>
<p>I feel tired whenever I turn on the radio. A continuous stream of advertisements, either saying they are hiring specialist technicians, or they are manufactured using science. No matter what it is, if it can be eaten, they always say it has vitamins. Time is limited, so the person reporting it reads it out like reciting a book. At the same time, the noisy sounds from the broadcast room are also broadcast out. This is not heard on foreign radio stations; it used to be stricter on the Central Radio Station. I used to often participate in amateur opera performances. Now, it often happens that you get there and it's incredibly crowded; then after a while, no one is singing anymore. This kind of broadcasting situation is too chaotic. I think there should be regulations on the timing. Regarding the broadcast of operas, they should also broadcast the full versions. Don't just sing a section of "Chasing Han Xin" or four lines from "Fenhe Bay," like playing a record. The other day's broadcast was for donating to refugees, everyone wasn't listening to the opera for the opera itself, but for disaster relief. It seems like it could have been more enthusiastic. For ordinary advertisement-style broadcasts, there is definitely no problem if no opera is broadcast.</p>
<p>I used to write some small reviews of storytelling songs in this publication. Now, I might as well say a few more things: Every day at 5:40 PM, Daya Radio has a segment of Wei Yuqing's "Pearl Pagoda," which is a solo performance. I haven't listened to it in a long time. It seems like it could be changed for something fresh. Compared to listening to Yan Xueting sing or Zhao Jiaqiu's Peking Opera, there is truly a world of difference. At 12:10 PM at noon, Yu Xiaoxia's "Jade Dragonfly" on Eastern Radio is still good to listen to, and her narration is better than Zhou Yuquan and others.</p>
<p>The French radio station at 1400 kHz has very good music records. I can't remember the time. I like to listen to violin solos the most, followed by piano solos, those are things that we can't hear at dance halls. If you love Western music, then please try it out.</p>
<h3>Xian Ni Society Continues at Xian Yue</h3>
<p>— Yu Gong</p>
<p>Xian Ni Society's performance at Xian Yue concluded on the 13th. This newspaper has previously reported that it signed a contract with the Great China Theater, and so on. But news has come that there have been changes, and it will continue to perform at Xian Yue. The circumstances are noted below.</p>
<p>The front stage authority of Xian Yue is a female, named Cheng Ba Mei. Xian Ni Society's performances at Xian Yue are only two hours a day, and the profits are split between the front and back stages. The same is true for Wang Jia Ban's dramas. After Xian Ni Society's term expired and it stopped performing, Wang Junda, the host of Wang Jia Ban, also terminated his contract with the front stage of Xian Yue due to excessive losses in the past two months, and will stop performing on the 17th. The Xian Yue authorities, having lost both Xian Ni Society and Wang Jia Ban, had no other entertainment to fill the slot for a time. Therefore, they earnestly retained Xian Ni Society, and changed the profit-splitting arrangement to a package deal. The host of Xian Ni Society, seeing that the guests and hosts had been very harmonious since performing at Xian Yue, and having been retained, immediately agreed. It was decided that performances would begin on the 18th. With Wang Jia Ban gone, Xian Ni Society will now have two performances, day and night. Those who love music will surely be ecstatic at this news.</p>
<p>It is also heard that after Wang Jia Ban's drama leaves Xian Yue, Wang Junda will reduce expenses and reorganize the team. Because he knows that Xian Ni Society has continued at Xian Yue, he is quite attentive to the venue of the Great China Theater.</p>

<p>The Summer Peck Grand Theatre has been taken over by Li Chiyun, a giant of the theater world. The internal renovation of the entire theater has already begun. Initially, Mr. Li sent a letter summoning Ouyang Yuqian, a famous screenwriter in Hong Kong, to return to Shanghai to host the premiere of a drama, but Ouyang declined politely in his reply, as the current environment does not allow him to return. Mr. Li then decided to change his approach, either performing Peking Opera or showing a movie. He plans to choose one of the two and is still considering it closely.</p>

<h3>Zhang Shouchong's Entertainment</h3>
<p>— Chou Cheng</p>
<p>When Mr. Yun Sheng, the father of Zhang Shankun, a giant in the film industry, celebrated his sixtieth birthday at the New New Restaurant yesterday, the Peking Opera performed day and night was performed by famous actors and was very wonderful. The day performance was "Dragon and Phoenix Present Auspiciousness," from Liu Bei's marriage proposal to Lan Hua's three provocations of Zhou Yu. Ms. Tian Ziwen played Liu Bei without a feminine air, Mr. Wang Shaolou played Zhou Yu, and his performance in times of crisis was very skillful; Ms. Li Xuefang's Sun Shangxiang had a theatrical expression; Wang Chunbai's Qiao Guolao was loyal; and Qian Lintong's Zhao Yun and Zhao Qiao's Zhang Fei can be described as a perfect match; Ms. Li Xiuying's Guo Tai and Wang Fusheng's Sun Quan were both appropriately cast, so they received a lot of applause. The headlining performance of Zhou Xinfang and Gao Boxi's "Xing Han Tu" was missed by me due to business, but I anticipate that it will definitely be wonderful. The night performance of "Xiao He Chasing Han Xin Under the Moon" by Han Langen, Cheng Xiaoting, Guan Xianling, and Yin Xiucen, was humorous and made people laugh until their stomachs hurt. Tang Tonggu and Xie Chenxing's "Pearl Curtain Village" was flawless. Dai Yanwan's "Drunken Concubine" had delicate expressions, vividly portraying the state of a young woman longing for spring due to drunkenness. The few movements of drinking a cup were natural and praiseworthy. The Gu Lan Jun and Gu Mei Jun sisters, one performing "Visiting Relatives," was comical and made people burst into laughter, and the other singing "Fenhe Bay" had accurate pronunciation and a generous appearance. They can be described as two wonders. No wonder the Arabs and their brothers sitting in front of the stage were smiling from ear to ear while watching. Most of the guests that day were famous actors, and they were familiar with the actors on stage, so the performers were very enthusiastic and the audience was very attentive. Before "Fenhe Bay" ended, the midnight bell had already rung. Fearing curfew, I went home first, so I did not get to see Wang Yuanlong and Sun Junbao's "Bai Ma Po," Zhang Wenjuan and Hou Jiankun's "Old General's Victory," Wang Xianqi, Yuan Meiyun, and Yue Feng's "Hong Xiu Xi," and Mao Jianqiu and Tian Ziwen's "Si Lang Visiting His Mother," Wang Shaolou, Qian Lintong, and Li Xiuying's "Filial Son," which I felt was a great pity. It was already dawn when it ended.</p>
<h3>Mao Jianqiu's "Pan Jinlian"</h3>

<h3>A Glimpse of Dahua</h3>
<p>Shanghai on Saturday I saw many dance hall advertisements in this newspaper, especially the Dahua Dance Hall's, which was the most eye-catching. Analyzing the advertisement, it can be divided into three points: The first point is the decoration and layout, which it says is magnificent, like ascending to a golden palace, and also says it is completely dragon-themed. I often frequent Dahua as well, but I have not yet seen the dragon theme, so when my friend asked me to go dancing the next day, I suggested going to see the dragon theme. As for how good-looking the dragon theme is, I think it has been a week, those who have been there have already seen it, and those who have not been there, might as well go to appreciate it. The second point is the music, which it says is conducted by contemporary first-class music arranger Kang Tuo Lailasi and Yi Leqie (18), and there is also Ke Le singing loudly. Ke Le Zan and is that Western fat woman, her singing voice is indeed very loud. The third point says that the dance world's first-class renowned red star tea dance is waiting to teach, and also says that the tea dance lineup is so strong that it cannot be stronger. These two sentences are definitely not bragging. Now I will write some of my observations below:</p>
<p>Yesterday I and several friends went to Dahua again, because I was thinking of writing an article about Dahua, so I asked several friends to count how many dance stars and seats Dahua has. After the music stopped, the first friend reported that there were sixty-four, the second friend reported that there were thirty-seven on one side, and the other side was probably the same number, so it would be seventy-four in total. Then everyone laughed and said that the numbers differed by as many as ten, which was no small matter, and a CPA had to be sent to count in person. A little red star, Ma Baobao, went to check and replied that there were seventy-one, and the case was closed vaguely.</p>
<p>The two most beautiful dance stars at Dahua, one is from Changzhou, surnamed Hu, I don't remember if her name is Hu Ying. Last winter, I was sitting there with Changshu Mei Lanfang, and he pointed her out to me and said that this person can be considered head and shoulders above the rest. I went to ask her to dance, her steps were stiff, and her language had not changed from the local accent. I was surprised that she was not like people here, and asked her that she was from a well-off family in the countryside who fled here. She herself said that if it were not for the pressure of family life, she would never have been willing to take on this lowly profession; I said, your concept is wrong, as long as people can exchange work for compensation, not violate the law, and not lose their personality, then that is a sacred profession, which is much better than those who sit and enjoy the benefits. Now this Changzhou friend, her clothes are also fashionable, her steps are also skillful; her hair is also permed in curly waves; and her language is not entirely local. But her appearance is still so beautiful, I wonder if she still remembers a few of my words? There is also Yang Meifei, an oval face, plus a pair of eyes that seem to be smiling but not smiling, how intriguing do you think she is? There are three who are lively and innocent, Ma Yuan, Ma Baobao, and Shu Yunlan. Among the three of them, Shu Yunlan seems to be the oldest, but in reality, she is the youngest. Her nickname is Little Hangzhou, and she is very popular at Xian Yue's night dance. Ma Yuanyuan is very sensitive. She will cry after saying three words, and then laugh again in a moment. We gave her the nickname Crazy Woman. Ma Baobao is very gentle. There are also Li Mingzhu, Ru Aina, Hu Meimei, Fang Lili, and Xu Cuiying, who all work at the Metropolitan Night Dance. I wrote about them in the Metropolitan Miscellaneous Notes before. There is also Huang Meiqin, who is a friend of my student, and she also calls me teacher. I heard that she can already sing a whole play of Scolding the Emperor. The Lin Yazhen sisters are very sweet and pleasing. Sister Ma is Ma Yuanyuan's older sister, she does not wear makeup and has her own style. Yingying and Feifei both know how to say humorous things. Ma Qiaoyun's liveliness is even one level higher than Little Hangzhou. There is also a person from Changshu. I met her when I lived in Changshu. Her family runs a shop outside the Dadongmen. She is indeed a small family's daughter, and has a similar situation as the person from Changzhou. I don't know if they two sympathize with each other?</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Forbidden City and the Pear Garden of the Former Capital (146)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The names of the characters in the play "Four Scholars" are mostly meaningful</p>
<p>Nowadays, fashionable people only know that "Striking the Fishing Family" is a good play for overthrowing local tyrants and evil gentry. So you say that this play has ideas, and I praise it as a valuable play suitable for the current trend. In fact, the evil gentry rely on corrupt officials and greedy bureaucrats. Moreover, the evil they do is only within one township. If we talk about it from the root, it is still most important to eliminate corrupt officials and greedy bureaucrats. Therefore, in my humble opinion, this play "Four Scholars" is not only more meaningful than "Striking the Fishing Family," but also the plot is more exciting. Therefore, I want to praise it especially. The names of the protagonist Song Shijie and the four scholars in this play are all meaningful. The two words "Song Shijie" are homophones for "litigation master." Originally, as an old man with white hair and the owner of a small inn, he was actually able to sue a circuit intendant, a local tyrant, and a county magistrate. Although he was sentenced to exile in the end, his righteous daughter noticed that the current investigating censor was the fortune teller, Liu Lin, who wrote the complaint. Therefore, he turned back and said, "The crime of suing is not as great as the crime of writing the complaint. If no one writes the complaint, the lawsuit cannot be filed." As a result, the Censor Mao was also afraid of being punished, so he personally came down from the hall to untie him. Later, he even submitted a memorial recommending him to be an associate minister. Looking at it this way, he is truly worthy of being called a master of litigation.</p>
<p>The cause of this story is that Yao Tian killed her younger brother-in-law Yao Yanmei. Later, Yanmei's concubine, Yang Suzhen, reported her. She then returned to her mother's home and angrily asked her younger brother, Tian Lun, to secretly intercede. Scholar Tian was originally an investigating censor who had not yet received his credentials to take office. Moreover, he had sworn an oath with four classmates at the Shuangta Temple before the God of Literature, saying, "God is above, disciples Mao Peng, Tian Lun, Jue Du, Liu Ti, this time we are officials outside, if there are officials who pass (a case), secretly intercede, take bribes and let (criminals) go, or approve a rebellious case based on favoritism, each will carry a coffin and return to our hometowns facing upwards." Since he had made such an oath, he would certainly not approve his sister's request. However, it was ruined by his loving mother's bowing. He was then forced to issue this, and only then did he disobey his conscience and secretly send a letter to intercede for the approval of this rebellious case, along with three hundred taels of silver to suppress the book. In this way, even if he violated the oath of the day, he was later dismissed from his post and became a commoner, never to be hired again, and almost lost his own life.</p>
<h3>Chess World</h3>
<p>— Edited by Bao Zibo, Proofread by Lu Chengzu</p>
<p>Opening Game Method, Game 29</p>
<p>Black moves first</p>
<p>Reversed Cannon against Central Cannon</p>
<p>The moves continue from the previous game</p>
<p>Rook 9 moves to the center rank 改 Cannon 8 moves to the center rank, Cannon 8 advances 4</p>
<p>(Explanation) The reversed cannon first uses Rook 9 to advance 1 to snatch out the horizontal rook, which is the originator, is not stable. In short, walking all the way with a windy formation carries some deceptive nature, or because the desire for speed is too heavy, hoping for a lucky success. Rook 9 moves to the center rank embodies the desire for speed. Pawn 7 advances 1 to gain the initiative. If you remove the pawn, then Cannon 8 moves to the center rank to hit the horse and gain a piece.</p>
<p>Rook 9 moves to the center rank 改 Cannon 8 moves to the center rank, first avoids the cannon to respond to Pawn 7 advancing 1, but already Cannon 8 advances to double hit the center pawn, making Rook 9 advance 1 with no way to go.</p>
<p>Variation 6, Black Wins</p>
<p>Rook advances 4 retreats 8 Rook 4 moves to rank 6 Rook 1 retreats 2 Variation 7 Cannon 8 moves to rank 6 Rook 1 moves to rank 5</p>
<p>General 5 moves to rank 4 Elephant 5 advances 3 Cannon 6 moves to rank 3 Rook 5 retreats 5 Rook 6 moves to rank 4</p>
<p>Rook 5 advances 1 Cannon 3 retreats 2 Cannon 6 moves to rank 3 Cannon 3 moves to rank 5 Cannon 1 moves to rank 6 attacking the rook wins</p>
<p>Variation 7 connects to 6</p>
<p>Rook 1 retreats 2 Rook 6 advances 3 Cannon 1 retreats 1 Rook 6 retreats 4 Rook 1 moves to rank 5</p>
<p>General 5 moves to rank 4 Elephant 5 advances 3 Below is the same as Variation 6</p>
<p>Another Variation 6 connects to the root</p>
<p>Rook 4 retreats 8 Cannon 8 moves to rank 6 Cannon 7 moves to rank 4 Rook 4 moves to rank 6 Cannon 4 moves to rank 5</p>
<p>Cannon 1 retreats 1 Rook 6 advances 3 Cannon 5 moves to rank 4 General 6 moves to rank 5 Rook 1 moves to rank 5</p>
<p>Horse 5 advances 4 General 5 moves to rank 6 Horse 4 advances 3 Rook 6 advances 4 Cannon 1 moves to rank 4</p>
<p>General 6 advances 1 Cannon 4 advances 3 Wins</p>
<p>This issue's answers have been generously taught by all sectors, and we are very grateful. Some of them were measured very well, but unfortunately not all of them were correct. Sincerely, Fu Rongnian</p>
