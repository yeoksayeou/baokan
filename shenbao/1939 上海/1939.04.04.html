<h3 id="c9">從軸心到三角 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>美國記者皮遜氏（T.　A.　Bisson），最近曾發表一篇文章，題目呌做「從軸心到三角。」這個題目很可借來一用，因爲近來國際上擾擾攘攘的形勢，正是在這「軸心」和「三角」上面急疾地旋轉着。</p>
<p>在歐洲，國際形勢的變動，眞像夢幻一樣的快。單是最近十幾天裏面；捷克斯拉夫沒有了；米美爾被吞併了；和平的西班牙塗上了法西斯的顏色；羅馬尼亞壓上了半殖民地的重負；波蘭也日歹痛感着納粹大軍壓境的危險……。從奧地利到捷克，從捷克到米美爾到羅馬尼亞或波蘭，這一幕慕的悲劇或慘劇，這歐陸上一片狼奔豕突的攻勢，無一不是德義的侵略軸心所造成。希特勒和墨索里尼似乎在進行着侵略的競爭。他們拿「恫嚇」作工具，以軸心相標榜、狼狽爲奸地侵奪英法以及其他弱小國家的利益。墨索里尼剛說完了一套恫嚇，希特勒又來了恫嚇一套。這樣此起彼伏地輪流進行着。在英法統治者的退讓政策之下，那柏林羅馬軸心侵略的攻勢顯在日益擴大，而且日益危害英法的安全和利益。</p>
<p>不錯，德義是有矛盾的，而且隨了希特勒在中南歐的擴展，這矛盾還在一天天加深着。德義在中歐有矛盾，在巴爾幹半島有矛盾。現在，奧地利和捷克固然都已落入希特勒的掌握，義國在巴爾幹的勢力也被掃蕩淨盡了。希特勒在中南歐勢力的節節擴展，自無疑是墨索裏尼背部針針的刺痛。</p>
<p>然而這矛盾的力，在目前郤斷不會迸散或削弱德義的勾結；相反的，這義德間日深的矛盾，郤還必將擴大並加緊德義軸心對外侵略的攻勢。爲什麽呢？這是有理由的。</p>
<p>首先，從阿比西尼亞到西班牙，義大利這雙泥足是在沼澤中愈陷愈深了；而希特勒却不費一卒的拿了奧地利，拿了捷克，拿了米美爾，在這點上，一褐衫弟弟」無疑强過他的「黑衫哥哥」。由於希特勒相對的增强，墨索里尼在外交上已日益渝爲德國附庸了。前月杪墨索里尼的演說，事前曾與希特勒有過一度電話的接洽，單從這個事實，就可知道柏林對於羅馬的控制作用。從墨索里尼頌揚德義軸心的言辭上，從義國倚賴希特勒的需要上，可以斷定墨索里尼目前是決不敢對德破裂的。</p>
<p>第二，從希特勒方面看來，也正是一樣。他需耍義大利當德國的鷹犬，使它從地中海方面去打擊英法，以加强其「敲詐」的聲勢。戈林說：「德國勢力擴展一步，亦即爲義國勢力增加一步；義國勢力增加一步，亦即爲德國勢力擴展一步」。前天希特勒演說，更特別聲明：「軸心國家間之關係較其他任何國間之協定，更爲堅全」。</p>
<p>因此第三，德義兩國的矛盾固然日益加深，而在侵略基調上却正需要相互標榜合作；墨索里尼在其强大的聯盟者前面喫了虧，爲了避免衝突，自然更只有轉向到今天還挺不起脊骨的英法方面去取得補償，而這也正就是希特勒領導下的反共集團的聯合戰略。一句話，義德日深的矛盾，反而促進了義大利加緊從地中海對英法的進攻。</p>
<p>不僅如此。這歐洲的侵略軸心並且擴展到遠東，跟日帝國主義結成了三角的關係。這侵略的「三角」，最初形成於一九三七年十一月六日的「反共公的」。到了最近，這侵略的三角是已有了更進一步的擴展和强化。像義大利一樣，日帝國主義因爲對華戰事的削弱，也日益在外交上降爲希特勒的附庸。張鼓峯事件敎訓了日本軍閥；蘇聯頭上是不能動土的；慕尼黑事件又暗示了日本軍閥；英法是軟弱可欺的。同時，在日本國內，由於關東軍的失敗，海軍的南進論日漸抬頭；向主英法協調外交的字垣因軍部不滿去了職，而由主張强化「反共協定」的有田繼了後任，這樣，日本軍閥就把它的戰略改北攻爲南進，今年二月初，首先進佔了太平洋的重要根據地海南島。——這同時恰恰執行了希特勒的意志。因爲此舉不僅威脅了英法美諸國的利益和地位，並且還可從海南島而窺印度洋，與德義聯絡，造成反共集團三角的新形勢。</p>
<p>海南島事件所造成的形勢是萬分嚴重的。然而英法當局除了提出幾决抗議外，郤再沒有更强硬的表示。這自然又鼓勵了侵略者。最近，白本軍閥索性更加緊與德義相勾結，並進一步的侵害英法的利益，這我們可以拿近幾天來的事實來證明：第一，法屬新南羣島（Sprattley　Is.）又於三月三十一日被日軍覇佔了。新南島在海南島之南，距星加坡僅四小時的飛機航程，而距法屬安南和英屬婆羅洲只需一小時，這對於英法美荷的威脅自然是非常之大的；第二，佔領區內的反英運動愈趨愈烈了，甚至敎會也受傀儡的歧視，這明明是日本軍閥導演下的醜劇；第三，前幾天柏林方面曾盛傳日本將以靑島和代管加羅林羣島交還德國，這正是日本巴結德國加緊勾結的表示。總而言之，希特勒領導下的這個「反共」三角，在歐洲和亞洲的活動平行綫，從來沒有像今天這樣的顯露。日本在遠東對英法利益的進攻，同時義大利在地中海上，和德國在中歐方面所進行的遙相呼應着。她們都有同一的目的；就是圍攻並傾覆英法兩大民治國家。因此，英法以及其他和平國家，共同建立更堅强的堡壘來抵禦這軸心或三角的擴展，在今天是怎樣迫切的任務啊！</p>

<p>財政部貿易委員會、竭力促進土貨輸出後、西南蒙自·龍州·騰越、各關貿易轉好、總稅務司已調派大批關員前往工作、土貨出口、戰後反較戰前增加、均集中香港、再轉海外各國、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>意圖促進土貨輪出</p>
<p>經竭力促進士貨輸出之後、主要土貨、如桐油·茶葉·動物及動物產品·礦砂·紡織織維·等、輸出反較戰前增加、並不因交通阻滯而銳减、如二十四年爲五萬七千五百八十萬九千元、二十五年爲七萬零五百七十四萬一千元、二十六年爲八萬三千八百二十五萬六千元、二十七年爲七萬六千二百六十四萬一千元、則足證戰後土貨輸出、反較戰前增加、貨物以紡織織維第一位、動物及動物產品第一位、礦砂及金屬製品第三位、</p>
<p>西南各關出口激增</p>
<p>主要土貨、業經貿易委員會管理、由西南以及浙閩各關出口、集中香港、再行轉運至各國、於是西南各關出口貨激增、例如龍州關去年之八月爲三萬七千元、今年二月爲二百十二萬八千元、蒙自關去年之八月爲一百卅一萬二千元、今年之二月爲一百九十八萬二千元、騰越關去年之八月爲十七萬一千元、今年之二月爲六十萬零六千元、思茅關去年之八月爲四百七十七元、今年之二月爲二萬七千元、汕頭關去年之八月爲三百四十二萬一千元、今年之二月爲四百四十六萬元、</p>
<p>大批關員派往西南</p>
<p>海關總稅務司梅樂和、鑒於中國之出口貿易重心、戰後已移至西南各關、據龍州·蒙自·騰越·思茅·等關稅務司電吿、因出口貨物激增、原有關員、不敷分配、要求增派關員、前往各關工作、梅總稅務司最近又調派關員前往、其中有華籍副稅務司數人、至於浙江之寗波·溫州·福建之泉州·廣東之汕頭·最近亦已增加關員、是項關員、大部係淪陷區各關所撤退者、</p>
<p>特准土貨免稅出口</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向海關方面探悉、財政經濟兩部爲促進土貨輸出、充實外滙基礎起見、主要土貨如桐油·猪鬃·皮革·皮貨·茶葉·礦砂·五倍子·藥村·羊毛·絲綢·苧蔴·腸衣·羽毛等、一律免稅出口、所以西南各關免稅出口貨激增、如今年二月份、龍州爲九十一萬四千元、蒙自爲十一萬元、騰越爲五十六萬九千元、汕頭爲一百六十一萬五千元、溫州爲二十七萬六千元、思茅爲二十萬元、</p>

<p>日方統制長江及內河綫航運之企圖、已憑藉其特殊暴力、决第實現、日淸公司在下游各口岸已派輪行駛、開始裝貨搭客、京滬綫火車陸運、亦减費兜攬客貨、致各外輪處此日僞雙車壓迫之下、兼之留難簽發「搬出證」等、故貨運淸淡、每班均吿虧蝕、茲探誌各情如下、</p>
<p>日清商輪開始行駛</p>
<p>長江下游（江南綫）自上海至江陰段、（江北錢）自上海至靑龍港各口岸之航運、經日方積極規劃、其統制企圖、已逐漸實現、沿江各口、如瀏河·楊林·七丫·白苑·滸浦·常陰沙·福山·碾砣港·張黃港、今由日淸公司於上月底起加派商輪五艘、開始搭客裝貨、因該公司事前已與上海軍事當局及沿江各地之日陸海軍駐防部隊接洽妥善、如客貨報裝日輪者、其「搬出證」可隨時簽發、沿途不受檢查與留　、至江北綫之靑龍港、自日軍駐防該港後、對外輪百般阻撓、致外商各輪船、均放棄該港貨運、日淸公司即乘機崛起、始初祇有日輪一艘行駛、現已增加對航班、</p>
<p>減低運費競奪營業</p>
<p>日方除攫奪沿江外商航業之外、復欲澈底剷除外商航運所有之權益、因鑒於日淸輪船各綫不敷分配、故將京滬綫火車陸路貨運費、極事减低、俾使內地各項貨物、不致運往沿江裝輪、而可改裝火車、同時內河各小輪、亦被日淸另組之內地輪船公司統制、在日方特殊暴力之下、水陸交通、已全被壟斷、其目的俟將來外輪航運打倒後、則可仟意抬高運費、壓榨商民</p>
<p>雙重壓迫外輪虧損</p>
<p>英·德·意·萄·等各外商輪船、遭此雙重壓迫結果、營業驟然淸淡、且日方對裝運外輪之客貨、其搬出證留難簽發、自上月中旬起、行駛沿江各口之外輪、每班均無貨可裝、虧損頗巨、據現代社記者探悉、各外商輪船公司當局、已聯合開會集議數决、討論具體辦法、向日方當局進行交涉、在外商中受日方壓迫最厲者、厥爲英商之太古·怡和·兩公司、德·意·商雖日方表面上似較通融、而實際權益之損失、何獨不然、故外商方面之洞燭日方奸謀、因業務利益相同、是以積極籌謀應付、</p>

<p>蘇北之海門啟東各港口、前因日艦時往滋擾、數度企圖登陸未能得逞後、頃據航業界消息、本月一日三廠方面日軍、復向華方陣地進犯、經華軍奮勇抵抗、旋被擊退、二日晨、有日艦二艘、駛至海門港口外、派小汽艇二隻、載日軍數十名在沿海游弋、似有登陸企圖、並用機槍掃射、當地駐軍、早已嚴密防範、日軍見已有備、即吿他去現蘇省當局已令行海門各港口駐軍、加緊戒備、隨時予已痛擊、</p>

<h3 id="c80">生的意義 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>不論是誰，一看見活潑潑地的兒童，沒有一個不感到生的意義的。就是最頑固最枯寂的老人，也都會因之而增加一些生趣。那末兒童節，簡直就可以當作生之節，我們一年一度的慶祝牠，實是應該的。</p>
<p>兒宣節定在四月四日，在淸明節的前一二天，的確最能表現生的意義。因爲道時正是嚴冬完全過去，萬物昭蘇，在開始欣欣向榮的當兒。我們本來也以這時爲一年中的良辰佳節，於今有了兒童節，就相得益彰了。</p>
<p>在西洋，這時也有復活節。牠的作用固然是含有宗敎色彩的，然而以大自然的運行論，這本來是萬物回春的時候，那末復活也者，正不妨活用一下，當作萬物的重生。重生就是返老還童，而兒童爲老年人的重生，這也增加了兒童節的意義。</p>
<p>假使我們以三月二十九日的黃花節爲死的象徵，那末，這四月四日的兒童節，就可以作爲生的象徵。出死入生，正不妨以兒童節爲我們精神上的復活節。</p>
<p>這都是說的往常的兒童節，而在這抗戰時期的兒童節，就覺得其意義更加深長了。</p>
<p>兒童是未來的成人，我們在這大時代中，正有許多事情，無窮責任，要他們來担負，所以我們要好好地培養他們，使他們生生不息，一切都超過我們。「十年生聚，十年敎訓」，我們當依此而行，以遂「沼吳」之願。</p>
<p>中華民國是由幾千年的古國復興起來的。這復興的工程，還只在起點，譬如兒童，還只在最幼稚的年齡。現在忽然遭遇了橫逆，猶如樹上的嫩芽，遭遇了霜雪，我們要以愛護兒童的心來愛護她，使她　根錯節，蔚爲大國。</p>
<p>因此，我們在兒童節要悟到生的意義，尤其要悟到國家民族的生的意義。</p>
<p>此外，人人都有求生的慾望；然而人人也正有不害生的禁條。害他人之生以求己之生，是人類的蟊賊，必須予以嚴厲的制裁，甚至將他們從人類中剔出。現在，正有這樣的蟊賊，並不妨礙他們的生，却來害我們的生，我們爲了自己的生，就只有奮鬥到底，消滅他們！</p>
<p>這是我對於生的最後認識，希望我們一致起而努力！</p>

<p>迎着一陣蕭瑟的寒氣，奔下山坡。心裏想，已經是初春的季候，怎麼原野上仍是僵凝着，沒萌動綠意？陰森的，凄凉的，一陣風，吹動墓頭草，還會發出恐怖的尖音。</p>
<p>停住了步子，瞄望荒塚：那些凌亂的殘草，衰枯的荊棘，交織成了一幅黃色地毯，鋪展開來；墓碑倒在那裏，荒冷沉靜的一片，沒有人憑弔，也沒有詩人來吟咏。</p>
<p>「就在這裏吧！荒塚當作堡壘，棺槨當作槍架，可以對着前面的公路。」</p>
<p>說這話的老强，立刻揮動泥鍫，像挖饅頭似的輕易，挖出了二尺對徑一個洞穴。身軀攢了進去，靜待着，把住機關槍桿向一個小孔外怒視着！我們把挖出來的泥土殘草壓平了之後，也一個快步，就穿過了叢林。</p>
<p>這個地帶是被認爲「掃蕩」了的，空氣裏的火藥味也似乎消失了。鬼子多麼得意，在婉蜒如長蛇的公路上蠕動着，那零落的黑影，就像野狗在覓食；把伏在荒塚裏的老强，望得眼睛裏發火，然而，他又祇好忍耐地屛息着，讓時間靜悄悄地逝去。由侵晨到中午，又到黃昏，他像一隻伏在繭中的蠶，那麼的潛藏着，牢記隊長的訓話：——鬼子認爲這地帶是被「掃蕩」了的，等到戒備鬆弛，估計得能够符合我們殲滅的量，就幹！</p>
<p>零落的鬼影，惹動他的怒火，不知道有多少次，終會因重溫訓話，而抑壓下去；繼續等待，注望，估計，延候到幾十個小時。</p>
<p>時間是快到第二天的黃昏了。</p>
<p>在沉靜的薄暮中，公路上傳來一陣喧囂，三個蓄八字鬍鬚，戴金絲眼鏡的鬼子，騎着高馬來了，指揮刀閃動出燦爛的銀光，得意而傲慢地，後面拖帶着一大羣。摩托在公路上顚簸，樣子很沉重，大槪是裝的軍火吧？</p>
<p>這時候，老强佔計得發笑了；憤怒之火又燃燒起來，劇烈而迅捷的，通過了他底全身；把住機關槍：——格格格格……勇猛地掃射一陣。</p>
<p>八字鬍鬚，余絲眼鏡的人，立刻翻下馬，接連地倒下去，汚血飛濺滿地。後面沒死的鬼子，都驚駭得發呆了，慌忙向四周亂射一陣，天空裏就縱橫交錯，組成了一個火網，籠罩着空曠的荒郊。</p>
<p>鬼子也許在懷疑吧？這是人間，還是夢境？張眼瞭望，曠野裏祇有沉靜如死的叢林和荒塚，並沒有人。</p>
<p>當他們跑步向叢林中圍攻時，老强却笑痛了肚皮，側臥下來吃乾糧。</p>
<p>一陣奔跑，老强又一陣掃射，火網下鬼子，也不知道倒了多少。</p>
<p>夜色漸漸地深沉，撲空的鬼子，依舊是驚嚇焦急，發怒；他們仗着精銳的器械來發揮其毀壞的威力了：——轟……通……冬……。山砲震動了整個的曠野，火燄在乾枯的亂草地上蔓延着；老强的熱血也跟着沸騰了，但他却更鎭靜地撫摸着機槍柄：格格格格格……，接着又大笑起來。</p>

<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>誰曾乘過一葉小舟，蕩漾於黑色大海中，長夜茫茫，一粒細小的生命捏緊於波濤，忽高忽低地跟着潮水奔逐，充滿了恐怖，憂愁與希望，而終於在盼禱着光明時，看到了水平綫上湧起一輪紅日，冉冉上騰，慢慢兒整個宇宙都變成溫暖，這喜悅曾有遜於再生的喜悅嗎？</p>
<p>是光明的喜悅，你說，不也同樣是再生的愉悅嗎？</p>
<p>雨使人發悶，霧使人愚蒙，夜呢，使人煩躁，誰曾患過失眠症？那怕一月二月也好，一夜兩夜也好，輾轉反側着，在牀上，腦筋糾纏着萬端思緒。誰能忍耐呢？沒有太陽，沒有光，也沒有熱，不消說是沒有溫情，也沒有歡喜。陷身在黑夜重圍中，人往往是孤獨的，沒有夥伴，沒有同聲，也許因恐懼的幻影而你驚呼，然而你事後竟又許發覺你曾瘖啞而噤默。</p>
<p>這時有比雞聲更可愛的嗎？在你未曾窺見薄薄的黎明時，而聰明的報曉者已爲你報曉了。不愁沒有光，沒有熱，沒有歡喜，沒有溫情。那往往是一個幸福的佳訊，高高的林梢，抹上一層淡淡的胭脂，蒼茫的遠天，透露一層朦朧的魚白，多迷離亦多變幻的海上，映射出魚鱗的金波。</p>
<p>也許你曾受困於噩夢，給牠們糾纒着，陷入於險境，窘境，啼哭之境，你窘迫，遇險，甚或你啼哭時，忽然從窗櫺間透進晨曦照在你臉上，涵蓄着無限溫情。在半疑半信間，你聽到了報曉的雞聲，終於你毅然的推開了夢。這時，你看到光明的再生，你能不喜悅嗎？</p>
<p>然而，請你想想，爲什麼你不曾給黑夜吞噬呢？你能從新見到光明，你是幸福的，但你爲何纔幸福的呢？</p>
<p>不也有許多人在黑夜中爬行着，喘着氣，又無聲的倒斃了嗎？他們從黑夜中爬向光明，像爬一座塔，遙矚那塔尖，那陽光，有的歎着氣說沒有力量爬，甘願蹲在黑暗；有的焦躁着不耐煩爬了，他們東倒西歪的，倒在每層角落底裏。有些人是最不幸了，他們耐守了一整夜，與黑夜搏鬬過不知過多少次，不幸失望了，在夜殘時，漏盡時，將瞧見塔巓時。他們給黑夜吞噬了，無緣再見陽光。</p>
<p>長夜，使人悲觀，而况又多噩夢，我們怕夜，怕黑，更怕黑　　夢，因此，我們盼望陽光，陽光給我們以歡笑，以溫情。</p>
<p>雖然那祇是柔弱的光，然而牠是光明的淵源。經過長夜的搏鬬，不曾給黑夜吞噬，我們竟又聽到雞聲了，這是人間歡欣的第一聲。</p>
<p>雞鳴了。但曉色還未全開，有些人躱在黑暗中嚷着黑暗。日出之前是最令人焦躁的，因爲夜來那麼悠長，甚於子夜，甚於初更。雖說有陽光了，也還有黑暗。</p>
<p>而且，日出之前，也還有許多人被黑暗吞噬。</p>
<p>只有始終找尋着光的人，才能把握住朝陽，迎上前去，眼看那些小醜一一消逝在陽光裏。</p>
<p>雞鳴了。但曉色還未全開。日出之前，你需要忍耐！</p>

<h3 id="c85">吿我的兒子 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— 古公</p>
<p>（有島武郞的「吿幼小者」，運每一個「長大者」讀了都是要感動的。我希望這篇「吿我的兒子」，連每一個父親也會有共鳴。）</p>
<p>今天是兒童節，你們都很高興。可惜我這個當父親的人，爲了戰事，失業至今，沒有什麼禮物可以給你們，只好對你們說幾句話，也算給你們過這個節。你們都是好孩子，都肯聽我的話吧。</p>
<p>你們現在當然還很小，阿大不過九歲，阿二不過七歲。但是阿大已經在小學三年級了，阿二在二年級了，平常聽聽你們的說話，民然也很有國家觀念和民族意識，對於我們的敵人，也知道咬牙切齒地痛恨，這很使我欣喜，那末我要對你們說的話，你們不見得聽不懂，我的話更其不會落空了。</p>
<p>我對你們說，第一，你們大起來，不必特意孝我，至多當我是一個同胞國民，我就滿足。因爲我的養育你們，完全是爲了國家，爲了全民族。你們長大起來，肯爲國家民族盡力，就是孝我，並且現在你們已經在不知不覺間，對我盡了孝。你們呌我「好爹爹」；你們和我親熱；你們愛我。我開心時看見了你們，更加開心，不開心時看見了你們，我也就轉愁爲喜。你們給了我許多快樂，安慰。你們使我做事起勁，因爲我想我是爲你們而奮鬥的，我有了目的。你們使我每天的生活有意義，因爲我耍養育你們大起來來……一切的一切，你們在無形中已經在大量地報答我，就是孝我，我已經很滿足。你們大起來，你們有更大的責任，我不要獨佔你們，甚至不要些微妨害你們的偉大前程，所以我不要你們再特意來孝我。好孩子，你們務必將我的話記在心中，長大起來了一定實行。</p>
<p>你們的「好爹爹」爲了上有你們的「好婆」和「阿太」，下有你們自己——你們的「好姆媽」是有獨立生活的能力的——，所以對於國家民族，不能完全効力，心裏一直在抱憾着，假使你們大起來，將你們自己完全獻給國家民族，代他盡職，你們眞是大孝子。你們一定要做這樣的孝子才是。</p>
<p>你們答應了我，我眞正喜歡，那末，第二，我就要對你們說出我希望你們去做的事情了。</p>
<p>我是性急的人，不喜歡兜圈子，凡事總喜歡直捷爽快。所以你們長大起來，假使你們的體格及格，我希望你們都加入空軍。阿大穩重些，或者駕駛轟炸機，阿二手脚靈便些，或者駕駛戰鬥機。萬一體格不及格，那末你們就加入砲隊，當砲兵。現代戰爭中，飛機和大砲是重要的武器，我們要消滅我們的敵人，所以我如此希望。再退一步說，如果不能入砲隊，則你們人任何種軍隊都可以。總之，你們長大起來要救國家救民族；要救國家救民族，就要當兵。</p>
<p>假使——我眞有些不願意說——你們也和我一樣，從小體力便不很好，眼睛也近視，不適於當兵，那末，我所希望於你們的，是去學習國防工程或國防化學。將來我們的「馬奇諾防綫」，或任何毒氣的發明與製造，都會有你們的份。普通的工程或化學，或其他實科，當然也能够救國家救民族，你們喜歡去學，我也未嘗不贊成。不過我再說，我是性急的人，在事勢危急的時候，更其覺得等不及，我總希望你們最有效地從事軍事工作。</p>
<p>末了，我對你們說，我最不願意你們像你們的「好爹爹」，只認得幾個字，會動動筆，一世吃不飽，穿不暖，至多只能做一個起碼的安份老百姓，於國家民族，沒有多大的帮助，現在眼見敵人像惡獸一樣到處橫行，雖然氣破了胆，還是不能親自去殺死牠們，逐退牠們。你們的「好爹爹」早就死了他的「好爹爹」，所以他沒有人指導，而家庭的負担也重，以致兩鬢漸霜，一事無成。現在你們總算有他來指導你們，有他來免去你們的內顧之憂，這是你們的幸運，你們就應該以打退敵人，不使敵人入境，爲你們將來的一生事業！</p>
<p>記好，阿大阿二，我的兒子：我要你們去當兵！不能當兵則從事與國防有關的職務！切切不要做我所做的事情！不要顧我！這樣，你們才是孝子！你們格外可以放心：你們的「姆媽」是和我同意的！</p>
<p>我的兒子，我眞喜歡：你們的小拳頭舉起來了，你們聽我的話了。眞的，敵人這樣的欺侮我們，此仇不報，我們還能够算人麼！我的兒子，快些長大起來！</p>

<h3 id="c107">樂園在那裏？ <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— 譚惟翰</p>
<p>兒童節到了。</p>
<p>公司裏不知是真為兒童打算，還是為自己的生意眼著想，早就佈置好了所謂「兒童樂園」。</p>
<p>然而條件有兩個：（一）要服裝整潔。（二）憑購貨發票入場。這不能不使那成羣無家可歸的流浪兒童仍舊被扔在樂園以外：進不得樂園，便衹好向地獄裏鑽了。</p>
<p>這裏，使我想起了別國為兒童所建設的樂園</p>
<p>新大陸上有一位名叫富萊納根（E.J.Flanagan）的神父創立了一個兒童城，專門教養流浪兒童，不特供給他們的膳宿，並且教育和陶冶他們的人格。目的在使社會上少一個遊民，多一個良好的公民。兒童城既為收容流浪兒童而設，所以沒有種族上和信仰上的限制，也不問他們從何處來的。但是條件也有兩個：（一）兒童是無家可歸的。（二）衹要城裏收容得下。</p>
<p>據創辦者所說：「我創立兒童城的原因是因為我相信世界上無所謂壞孩子這種東西。二十一年來的經騐，更叫我沒有改變這個觀念的理由。」是的，一個孩子在未成年時，決不會變成「壞蛋」，問題在於有沒有良好的指導</p>
<p>在兒童城中他開辦了活字印刷所，皮鞋修理店，木匠作，牛奶棚和農場及幹洗場等。兒童學會了這些事業，就是離開了兒童城，再無須依賴慈善機關的救濟，也能夠自食其力了。</p>
<p>「當我曉得，我的一個孩子變好了，」富萊納根說，「我就覺得我替這輩無家可歸的兒童所出的力，造就他們的功夫，並不是白費的！」（編者按：十月南京大劇院開映的「兒童樂園」就是描寫富萊納根神父建造兒童城底艱苦的歷史）</p>
<p>讓我們再看看蘇聯的兒童城又是怎樣？關於這，程國　君在蘇聯兒童城訪問記（見教育雜誌第二十七卷三號）中記載得十分詳細，下面便是他的話：</p>
<p>「各國關於兒童的種種設施，從沒有像蘇聯兒童城那樣的完備。兒童城範圍甚大，包括各形各色符合兒童興趣和需要的場所。牠不僅是一個消遣娛樂的地方，卻是合於兒童心理和科學原則而設立的。在那面，有研究電流，航空，和其他水陸交通要具的科學實騐館，有供給兒童以動植物知識的生物研究所，有應用科學玩具以增進史地知識的俱樂部，有具備各種器械的遊戲場，尚有為母親代理養育之勞的幼稚園……」</p>
<p>的確，這是足以使我們羨慕，興奮，和感動的。然而我們的國家也和別的國家一樣承認兒童是未來世界的主人翁；承認良好的品性，習慣，必須從幼年養成。可是事實又告訴了我們，這般未來世界的主人現在卻大多數成了人類的渣滓；到處我們可以看見有流浪兒童——有人說他們是幸福之花——的足跡，眼淚和創痕。</p>
<p>兒童節到了。公司裏為兒童設下了美麗的「樂園」。讓我很不客氣的代表這羣數不清的無家可歸的兒童問一聲：</p>
<p>「我們的樂園在那裏？」</p>

<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>——兒童不幸的遭遇及其幸福開展的斑——</p>
<p>本來，上海的兒童，可說是全國最幸福的兒童；因為這次「聖戰」的影響，上海的兒童，是夠不上說幸福了。兒童的餓死，凍死，病死，是到處可見的事實，苦難，漂泊，流浪，更是普通的現象。</p>
<p>到最近，上海各界對於兒童的幸福事業，已稍稍注意起來。在兒童節的時候，大家正需要知道目前上海關於兒童事業的狀況，爰就所知，略述梗概，以供參考。但是這裏要請大家注意的，並不是說現在上海的兒童，已入於幸福之境。當然慘痛的事實，現在還是普遍地存在著，不過在這慘怛的霧團裏也多少有了一線光明吧！希望大家鼓起勇氣，循著這一線的光明邁進，使不久的將來，全上海的兒童，能夠普遍地踏入幸福的園林裏。</p>
<p>（一）為兒童謀幸福的機關</p>
<p>中華慈幼協會</p>
<p>該會是由熱心慈幼問題的中外人士所組織，創立於民國十七年。他們所揭曉的宗旨，是「提倡，維護及保障中國兒童之權利，並以種種可能的方法，為兒童謀求幸福。」現在所有的業務，共分五組：（一）保障組，保障一般兒童的權利；（二）救濟組，救濟無依靠的兒童；（三）衛生組，促進兒童衛生；（四）研究組，提倡父母教育和兒童訓練；（五）宣傳組，喚起民眾慈幼意識。（編者按：工作情形見上月二十七日本刊）</p>
<p>上海兒童保育會</p>
<p>該會是去年六月中才成立的。現有理事三十五位，陳鶴琴便是該會的理事長，陳濟成和黃定慧是副理事長。其組織分四部：（一）總務部，（二）經濟部，（三）事務部，（四）編輯部。會所是在大沽路上海女子大學內。</p>
<p>該會舉辦的事業，有報童學校十所，教育報童五百多人。現又增設了十一所，共有二十一所。最近正籌備設立丐童教養院，收養街頭的流浪兒童，並且在今天開幕。繼丐童教養之後，還要組織童工救護委員會，以增進一般童工的福利。（編者按：工作情形見上月十日本刊）</p>
<p>（二）兒童組織的研究團體　六六兒童科學研究社</p>
<p>該社是一羣歡喜科學，愛好自然的小朋友所組織的，成立於民國二十四年六月六日，最初參加的社員，又是六十六人，所以定名為六六兒童科學研究社。他們所抱的宗旨是：「使兒童滿足求知的慾望，得到共同研究的利益，並養成研究科學的興趣和習慣。」</p>
<p>該社的組織，分圖書，研究，出版等三股，並設社長，文書，會計各一人。現有社員七十多人，都佩帶著一個梅花形的「66」社徵。社員在入社時，須繳入社費二角，以後每學期每人納常費二角。凡是對於科學有興趣的，年在十歲至十六歲的兒童，都可加入。</p>
<p>每學期中，他們召集全體社員，開大會一次，討論社務的進行。每月舉行一次研究會，有時規定研究中心，或改行演說會，辯論會，實地觀察，實騐表演，徴文懸賞等活動。每週土矅日出版「科學兒童」一期，附刊於兒童報，為社員互相研究，報告心得的園地。</p>
<p>新兒童讀書會</p>
<p>該會的宗旨是：「利用課餘光陰，研究正當學識，引起讀書興趣，養成自修習慣，籍此聯絡感情，發揚親愛精誠。」每兩月舉行會員大會一次，每半月舉行會務會議一次，每週舉行學藝座談會一次。由會員大會產生正副會長，並設秘書處，學藝股，會員股，監察股，圖書館及康樂，出版等職，主持一切研究事宜。</p>
<h3 id="c110">讀冉熙個人水彩畫展 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 駱駝</p>
<p>藝術是時代的產物，藝術是隨時代而轉移，時代不息地向前，藝術亦是跟著時代並行的。倘若有一種藝術固凝著，而不跟隨時代進展，那麼，就顯出藝術的羸弱，甚至有滅亡的危險。高奇峰先生曾經說過，「繪畫不是一件死物，而是一件有生命能變化的東西，每一時代自有一時代之精神的特質和經騐。一個畫家不只是徒博名譽的，也不是聊以自慰的，當要本天下有饑與溺若己之饑與溺的懷抱，具達己達人的觀念，而努力於犧牲利　的繪事，闡明明代的新精神。」這也是說明藝術與時代的不可分享的關係。</p>
<p>中國自從抗戰發動以後，在文化方面，就有新啟蒙運動。因為中國的抗戰，不只是抵禦瘋狂的侵略者，而且要建設新生的中國，與新中國的文化。文化部門之一的繪畫，當然是負有重要的任務的。可惜，中國的繪畫界，並沒有把握住這偉大的時代。這是多麼的寂寞與孤獨呀，我嘆息中國畫壇的冷落。而在今年的上海，當燕子歸來的時節，我看到水彩畫家冉熙的個人展覽，正如春日的陽光一樣，給我心裡以溫暖的滋潤。</p>
<p>此次個展作品，共計六十餘幅，陳列於馬斯南路口中法聯誼會內。皆是精純的作品。水彩畫家有一個容易犯的毛病，不是手腕太生疏，就是缺乏情調，冉熙的畫是沒有這種毛病的，他的手腕已達到精純的境地，他的表現力是急越的，是熱情的；熱情是藝術家的生命，藝術家假使沒有熱情，不但畫面呈出一片灰色，給與社會的影響也是一片灰色的人生，而冉熙的畫每一幅都充滿了生氣與朝氣，紅色的調子浴於新鮮的陽光里，寫著那些行人，街道，樹木與房屋，并且加倍速地使它們活躍起來，豐富起來，如置身於春天的郊野里的一樣，這種富於生氣的作品，在象徴了新生的中國，而且，新生的中國，也正須要這類蓬蓬勃勃地藝術。</p>
<p>冉熙水彩畫的構圖，喜歡用一種強烈的對比，比如，將天空留得很高，屋宇和地面繪得很小，於是，在那高高的天空中，看見一些疾馳的行雲，筆勢是非常流麗和渾厚的。對於光線配合的適宜，尤其是冉熙繪畫的特色。</p>
<p>一個成功的藝人，要靠天才與努力，冉熙有相當的天才更希望他不斷地努力。</p>

<p>從前在郵政局裏寄快信，在快信以內，還有許多名目。有平快，特快，航快等許多分別，當然是航快最快。航快就是航空快信了，但也限於國內航空到達的幾個大城市，取費也是很貴。至於非航快的快信，往往很慢，和那些平信，不相上下。至於一有阻礙，特別快就變成了特別慢了。這也不能怪郵信機關，他們也無可如何。現在卻不然了，凡是快信，通統用飛機遞送。並不必用航快這個名目，而一概是航空飛寄。這有幾個緣故：一即，國內的航空公司四通八達。不要說國內，便是連繫在國外的，無論歐洲美洲，那一國的世界飛航公司不與中國打通？二則，就是中國的郵政局，自己也有好幾條航空線，自己也有特備飛機，專供寄遞快信用的，近來也日漸擴充了。三則，人事繁賾，時間愈求經濟，沒有快捷的法子，也是無法，既有快捷的法子，豈肯仍守舊法。譬如坐慣了汽車火車的，還甘愿坐從前的牛車騾車嗎？因為航空的飛機多了，當然航空站也多了起來，中國全國的飛機場，到處皆是。但像安樂鎮這些市鎮地方，是沒有飛機場的，大概郵政局是有個航空網的，那個局子，離那個航空站最近，便送到那個航空站去。還有某處地方，並不必要停機，而書信倒有不少的。他們卻備有一種書信　，將書信裝入　中，擲下飛機場。下面也有人守候在那裏，接著了書信　，分頭遞寄了，總之為了書信利便起見，自有新穎妙法，筆難縷述。自有航空遞信之法，真做到了朝發夕至。就像由安樂鎮寄到北平的快信，隔夜交郵，明天的下午，就可以到北平。這信恐怕還是由安樂鎮到上海，上海直飛北平的。不過依時間分配起來，倒是安樂鎮到上海，比了上海到北平的時間，要加機倍咧。還有從小飛行機上，轉運到大飛行機上去的。有似出國的大飛艇要飛過太平洋，大西洋，載客至百餘人，運貨至若乾噸。因此欲求其迅速，各城市的小飛機場，便載客至大飛機場，附搭大飛艇，好比從前黃浦灘前，用小火輪運送客人上大輪舶，一樣的道理。（七八）</p>

<h3 id="c113">由兒童節說到　夫婦愛情的重要 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>伶俐子女是愛情的結晶</p>
<p>兒童真是活寶貝，他是父母生命的繼續者，家庭的繼承人，社會的未來柱石，民族國家的未來主人翁。他的責任是多麼的遠大，他的前途是多麼的光明，所以無怪一般父母們，對於他們愛情的結晶的兒童，要稱之為「寶寶」「寶貝」了。</p>
<p>今天是四月四日的兒童紀念節日，學校放了假，各公司商號關於兒童物品特別減價或闢著兒童遊樂的場所以招待兒童，各種機關團體都舉行紀念會演講會遊藝會等，總之，在今日是整個世界上都在熱烈地慶祝著這兒童節日，這是多麼的隆重而有意義呀！不過，在這兒童節日，我們對於一般年輕的夫婦進一忠告：就是兒童必須要是夫婦愛情的結晶。因為在優生學以及醫學上的論斷。一個精力充沛的健壯男子和一個健美多姿的女郎結婚，他們必然愛情濃厚，朝歡暮樂地組織著快樂的家庭生育著伶俐的子女，這種愛情結晶品的兒童，必然聰明·活潑·健康·美麗，真是一個活寶貝似的小天使。同時在夫婦間因為有這愛情結晶品的聯繫，他們的愛情必然格外強固，夫婦生活必然的充實而美滿。這是何等的幸福！可是男子如果於早年犯有自凟與遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾，致天賦機能衰弱，爆發著滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，精薄不育，發育不全，神經衰弱等症。則夫婦生活必不能圓滿，或竟完全不能人道，則夫婦關係有名無實，愛情淡薄，青春幸福喪盡，並且所生子女，大都瘦弱多病，死亡率特多，或竟不能生育，貽終生大憾！</p>
<p>上述病症唯一補救辦法，據世界名醫及餘經騐，均以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最為對症而特效，誠以此劑於服後一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，一經服用，必可於短期內將上述各症完全治癒，並可收延年益壽返老還童之效。惟有遺精者須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，制止遺洩，則收效尤速。誠有著健康的身體，當此兒童節日，祝你倆愛情彌駕，早育佳兒。</p>

<h3 id="c114">乳峯和春遊 <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>春天真是女人活躍的季節。雖然這幾天雨絲風片，氣候似乎冷了一些，但正因為冷了一些，一旦天氣放晴，公園里萬卉競放，益覺春意盎然！此時許多遊春的娘兒們，她們是穿了薄薄的春裝，露出雪藕一般的粉臂，楊柳那麼輕倩的腰身。更配上一對高聳而引人的乳峯，在胸前扶搖生姿，面頰上是泛起盈盈的笑靨，和著多情的伴侶，或則小立亭畔，看蛺蝶之雙雙，情話喁喁。或則偎傍水榭，聽小鳥之飛嗚，曼歌一曲，人面如桃花一樣的嬌艷，歌聲和鶯聲一般的清脆，互偎互倚，情致纏綿，那是多麼美妙而幸福的一個畫面？</p>
<p>可是這樣美麗幸福的畫面，健美喪失的女性，是無福參與的，試想健美喪失的女性，她的乳峯還能高聳嗎？臂部還能豐腴嗎？面色還能似桃花一樣的嬌艷嗎？那無疑是不可能的了！因其不可能的了，她們是衹有黃瘦的面孔，平坦的乳房，和瘦削的臂部，雖也一樣穿上新裝，也掩不了她的醜態，這樣的女子，不但被人厭惡，無人和她把臂連袂，在公園裡情話喁喁，就是對鏡自瞧，也覺抱恨無窮！然而抱恨有什麼用呢？妳如果明瞭健美喪失的原因所在，積極服以卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」，則猶可及，蓋此劑配製精良，不論妳是為了月經不調，或是產後虛弱，白帶，痛經，以及病後失於調補，都能在最短期內，一一為妳治好，如果繼續服用，不但可使乳峯高聳，且能返老還少。使面頰紅潤，益增嬌艷。</p>

<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>夢魂，這兩個字，是多麼的含有詩意呀、可是在春情發動期的夢魂是潛伏著危機的。當甜蜜的美夢繚繞在「黑甜之鄉」的時候，有的被歡笑喚醒了，因為感著夢境的虛幻追想夢境的甜蜜，引起了手淫。更由手淫成習，致精關失司，繼起了遺精。即由夢魂的繚繞，制不住性的刺激，頓時就引起遺精者亦是常有的事。總之，春情發動期的夢魂，好的少，壞的多。</p>
<p>青年一有手淫與遺精，即應覺悟，清心寡慾，痛改前非，如遺精不止，更應及早延醫服藥診治，切不可忽略，要是不以為事，任期病症惡化，必至精枯血竭，造成腎虧無能，局部短小，精力渙散，久婚不育，神經衰弱等症，則終日困頓在痛苦之中，不特學術與事業的前途，毫無希望！就是在人生不可少的傳宗接代之夫婦生活上，亦必不能兩情協調營圓滿的生活，而為妻痛恨，演出家庭間的種種悲劇！同時，在男子的本身，因病苦與憂愁交加，更將未老先衰或竟早年殀殤！</p>
<p>遺精的特效療法，在此時只有服「希米脫氏固精片」則即可鞏固精關，鎮靜神經，使夢幻減少，終夜安眠，遺精自可根除。如因遺精已引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以增益精血，培補腦腎，滋養神經，若繼續服用，必可於短期內將上述各症完全治癒，並可收益壽延年返老還童之效。</p>

<p>不姙無憂</p>
<p>因白濁而失去患者生育之本能，此在失姙之統計上，淋病確占最高率，而此等淋毒性之絕孕症，又以睪丸炎占多數。故淋病患者對於副睪丸炎一症，無不具最大之恐怖，而稽考副睪丸之構造，內約有二十條管孔集成，其作用　為輸送睪丸內已生成之精子。不幸而發生副睪丸炎，障害其輪運精子之工作，因而遂失娠姙之條件。此外又因睪丸是製造精子之工具，所以如果發生睪丸炎，對於生殖上確屬一大威脅。但如睪丸未趨堅硬程度，則仍不患無挽救之方法。</p>
<p>惟一預防睪丸炎失孕之方法，在於用迅速之方法，驅除其炎症，使將垂閉塞之管腔，因炎症之消退而恢復其正常的生理狀態。如此則亡羊補牢，猶為未晚。在睪丸炎腫下垂時，必囑患者安靜，及用特制提睪滯以支撐下垂之睪囊，更注射德國希氏血清，以抗淋消炎退腫，一方用德國濾淋平流電療法，作直接扑滅淋菌，如此在二三星期內，其睪丸炎證，當可十去六七，在五星期，炎症可完全治癒。所有病態，自可迅速扑滅，如確已證明其治癒之後，更用多次檢查其精液，如能檢出其純粹之精液，而不混有其他雜質，則可證明此項絕孕之淋病，依然如黍谷回春，重行恢復生殖之機能，此為餘十數年來之實地經騐，許多病家，當其患多年絕孕之淋病，經餘治癒後，無不有滿意收穫！</p>

<h3 id="c117">各國對於兒童影片的重視 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 影</p>
<p>—寫在兒童節</p>
<p>電影已被認為輔助兒童教育的速成工具的一種，所以世界各國，目前對兒童影片是非常重視。今天是兒童節，因此，筆者要把各國對於兒童影片重視的情形，約略地向讀者報道一下。</p>
<p>美國　美國是電影事業先進的國家，因此，美國的電影教育，也比任何邦國為進步。美國的學校，現在已有不少購置映影機，在沒一個星期日或節日放映兒童影片。這種影片，有的由公家收集材料，編成劇本而特攝的，有的由影片公司攝成，專讓學校或教育機關放映的。就是通常的電影院，公映含有兒童教育意義的影片，凡是兒童進去觀看，沒把票價減得非常便宜。</p>
<p>英國　在傳統上，什麼都帶些守舊色彩得古老得英國，電影當然也不　例外尤其是對於兒童影片，特別注意。各地得電影檢查會檢查影片得時候，對於影片，沒一部要冠上A或U一字，A字就是Aduii的縮寫，衹准成人，不准兒童觀看的意思，U字是Universal的縮寫，成人與兒童一樣可進去觀看的意思。近年以來英國更由國家設置專管兒童影片的機關，拍攝兒童影片，在各地的公共機關或學校裡面公映</p>
<p>德國　德意兩個獨裁國家，對於兒童影片也重視，但自法西斯蒂的勢而後，這兩個邦國，先後把電影事業加以統制，以電影當做樂宣傳主義的工具，政治作用重於娛樂意味。所以兒童影片也不是例外，由公家選擇了兒童影片的材料，攝成影片，有的是　明，有的是暗示的，把法西斯主義，國社主義，向兒童宣傳。而各電影院，各學校，更時常有這種兒童影片的公映。</p>
<p>蘇聯　蘇聯電影事業的進步，有特殊的神速，時促使任何人表示驚奇的。尤其是對於電影教育，非常注意，　就莫斯科說來，每一個例假的日子，有五百多家電影院，自上午九時起，到下午九時止，輪流公映兒童影片，票價是低廉，為別國所未見。這些影片，包括正片，卡通片，由政府攝制，專門供給八歲以上，十六歲以下的兒童觀看的。在攝制方面，故事的取材，都以兒童為對象，和普通影片不同。</p>
<p>中國　最後要說的便是我們中國中央電影檢查委員會，對於影片的檢查，並沒有是否適於兒童觀看的標明，國家更沒禁止兒童看某一類影片的法令。但近年以來，對於電影教育也很注意，單就上海說來中國電影教育協會，在上海設有分會，時常把特攝的，或選出的兒童影片，在各中小學輪流免費公映。衹是八一三之後，這個機關也跟這國軍撤，而暫時的撤離了。</p>
<h3 id="c118">溝通中外文化　公演法國名劇卡門（下）　歐亞劇藝公司在蘭心演出 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— 冰獨</p>
<p>劇本介紹</p>
<p>（卡門）的劇作者皮才氏GeorgeBizet一八三八年生於法京巴黎，他的第一個歌劇Docteur　Bliracle在一八五七年出版，但直至（卡門）Carmen劇受到大文豪尼采的鄭重推薦，才為藝壇所重視，這個戲的故事，是講一個法國少年軍　愛上了一個吉波賽的姑娘，淪為盜賊，但同時卡門愛　牛者的勇敢剛強，並發現軍　的柔懦庸弱，逐　情變，軍　於妒憤之下殺死卡門，結束了這個三角戀愛的悲劇。</p>
<p>全劇一共四幕，劇作者除描寫一個　　斯故事以外，更沉重的刻畫出一　吉波賽人走私和土痞流氓的流亡生涯，它一樣有莎　（羅密歐與朱麗葉）的魂麗豪魄，特別是細膩溫馨的氣氛，但不同的是，莎　以男女的至情去解除人類的仇恨，而（卡門）則用一種力的象徵說明愛情的勝利。</p>
<p>在男子心中封建或資產社會裡，特別在法蘭西，這劇本對於熱情狂放民族性濃厚的戀愛嘗試者，（卡門）必然會為一度受歡迎的戲劇，然而（此時）（此地）的上海，（卡門）對與華人觀眾似乎不大感有較多興趣的，第一由於民族性的　庭，第二再以時間上變幻特別的藝術至上　　軟弱的歌劇，不懂說它的主題還不及（　　），即使中國自身的　曲舊劇，葉早已走上日幕途窮之路了。</p>
<p>演出觀感</p>
<p>演出成績原不會有過奢的估計，但衹少在我個人的觀感是如此。</p>
<p>第一，音樂除Habanera和第二幕的Toreoder稍可一聽之外，樂隊指揮者Maestro　E.Marcus並不會盡較大的職責，像高昂　進的情緒始終不會自然地把握過，僅僅是在Feeling的插曲中得到一點成就。第二，歌曲技術不夠，有幾位演員如M.Speransky(　鬥牛者)G.Sayapin(　軍隊長)等嗓子嘶啞，傷害了歌劇成功的主要條件，使人長起一種厭憎的感覺。第三，演員演技這裡均未有明快的開展，特別使導演，它處理全劇除了第二幕酒店內的　眾場面和吉波賽舞一塲相當可取之外，像第一幕中的獲罪被囚和隊長被執的地方，沒有顯明地去描寫，再如陶才謀擊鬥牛者愛司凱密羅，也不　有最低程度的渲染，我覺得處理一個延長四小時的舞台劇不是容易的，特別是Opera的困難，全劇再S.Ulianov先生的導演之下，無論光音藝三方面都覺得零亂而缺乏調和感，如果不這樣說那麼一個華人　觀眾對於在俄人主演下的法國歌劇，至少是作怪在那兩重不同磨滅的血統隔膜吧！</p>

<p>— 王蘭</p>
<p>前次應皇后劇院之宴於廣西路天天飯店，到有本刋編者及報界同人甚夥，席間曾與海上滑稽名藝人易方朔談及難童學校事。就中已有一般兒童正在學習崑劇。爰誌之於后。</p>
<p>自八一三戰後，海上一隅被難後致無家可歸之難童，殊不乏人，餐風露宿，厥狀殊極爲悽苦，良以彼輩皆爲未來中國之主人翁，若令其長此凍餒，仁者不忍，故承海上諸慈善聞人籌資剏辦此難童學校。成立之初，僅係收養性質，厥後乃量才施以訓導，俾得各就所業，自食其力焉。現今已有比較簡單之各科工藝製造之實施，出品頗稱不惡，惟非本文所應述者，姑暫從略。其中有一般兒童天性近於戲劇者，乃由愛好崑曲之名票溥西園（即溥侗又名紅豆館主）予以訓練，全班共計四十人，內中生旦凈丑，皆量才敎授，務使其得底於成而後已。爲期雖僅數月，成績已大有可觀。將來當不難爲行將成絕響之中國固有藝術放一異彩，而力挽旣倒之在瀾也。同時襄助於紅豆館主者，尚有當年敎授仙霓社傳家班之名敎師兩人，每日孜孜誘導，不遺餘力，亦一般莘莘學子之幸事矣。又據方朔君云。彼本人亦爲該校贊助人之一，曾聞諸主持該校之諸位慈善大家云及，此後將進一步增設丐童學校及報童學校等，以期地無棄材，人無荒廢，就中尤以報童頗易施以訓練；蓋凡屬報童，類多略識之無，且有一目了然於普通文字者，故對於訓導方面，當比較易於着手也。並悉工部局方面對於此類慈善事業，願予以相當之贊助，（已見上月二十七日各報所載。）則前途一切，更易進行矣·記者願爲各難童丐童報童輩，馨香祝禱，以盼其成。</p>

<p>金素琴自港寄</p>
<p>像晴天的霹靂一樣，一位熱情的友人，忽然從海上寄給我許多報上關於我的記載，眞讓我口呆目定，啼笑皆非。在八一三後，我是遭受某一階層所厭惡蔑視，差不多見到我的名字，趕緊要吐口涎沫的樣子。可是同時我交到了許多一向對於我淡然的朋友。於前者，我祇認爲由於見解上的歧異，我決不敢存一點仇視的心理。於後者，他們熱誠的鼓勵，確給予我一種莫大的慰安，使我銘感刻骨，永世難忘。要說我一離開上海，便信口開河，不分皂白地將海上友人平白無故挖苦上一陣，我想稍爲跟我熟一點的朋友，終不會相信我昏憤胡塗不明事理到如此吧！</p>
<p>如果編輯先生許允我一個自白的機會，我想把事實說一說。當我到港的第二天，承劉慶萱，王曉籟，毛和源，阮維揚，胡好，諸位先生的不棄，在香港大酒店爲我開了一個茶話會。席上發言的先有阮先生跟歐陽先生。他們二位，固然並不曾有一句話說到上海的情形怎麼樣。而輪到我的答詞，確實只有短短的五句：</p>
<p>『索琴這次由孤島到香港來，所做一些事，不過是一點義務，今天蒙主人這樣招待，非常謝謝。』（見報載原文）</p>
<p>此外，還有王曉籟，陳孝威，顧無爲三君致詞，可是也根本沒有刺激上海朋友的話。我眞不解做那篇通訊的先生，從何附會，替我憑空杜撲了那樣一篇宏論？雖然欲加之罪，何患無詞，可是攻擊人也要憑眞憑實據，使人心甘意服。</p>
<p>我現在附上一頁港報的記載，如承製版轉刋，以明眞相，而稍平上海朋友的三分怒氣，則弱女子眞是感恩匪淺了。</p>

<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>十三妹孝親年羹堯尊師</p>
<p>據說有一次他於風雪中坐在綠呢大轎裏，忽然一時起了惻隱之心，命手把轎杆的兩名護衛「去手，」誰知這兩人竟不約而同的各自拔出佩刀，將扶在轎杆上的一隻手斫掉。他當時瞧了，才覺得自已的號令太也嚴厲了，他本來的意思。原是因爲那日天氣太寒冷，自個坐在鋪着虎皮褥子的大轎裏，身穿重裘，尚且感覺冷氣侵人，再往外一瞧，兩名把轎杆的侍衛，每人的一隻手裸露在外邊，經寒風一吹，還有不凍僵的麼？因此才起了善心，打破紀錄的發出個「去手」的命令來。在專制時代，大將軍的威嚴，眞是了不得的，他旣不能像我們平常人說話一樣，類如說「你們兩人把扶在轎杆上的一隻手放下去吧，」又不能很慨歎的說道：「今兒天太冷啦，雪下得這樣大，風刮得這樣緊，難道你們也不覺得冷麼？如其不然的話，把手放下去吧。」像這些嚕嚕囌囌的說話，似乎全不是官塲中人所應道的，往往人說「官派」，官派就是命令式的，一句話只能用上三兩個字兒。年大將軍素來是殺人不貶眼的，所有他的部下，全沒見他發過一次善心，今天他呌去手，他們作夢也想不到是呌他們把手拿去，或拿開的意思，因此除了斫去手腕，以接受大將軍的命令之外，又有個甚麼遲延的方法，讓他們去思忖思忖呢？而况軍令如山，稍一猶疑，就有個不遵命令的罪名加在身上，倘是如此，那還能保着自已的腦袋麼？</p>
<p>有一次雍正閱兵，因時值炎夏，赤日當空，操練的時間太久，就有許多兵士昏倒在地，雍正遂傳旨罷操，但是諸將因爲未曾奉到年大將軍的命令，所以依舊操演如故，後來年羹堯祗把令旗一擺，霎時衆軍散去。雍正一想，我的聖旨，反倒不如他的令旗有效，萬一日後年羹堯反叛起來，軍權都在他手，那是無法制服的，故而未到幾年，就把這位煊赫一時，名震邊陲的年大將軍給賜死了。（時在雍正三年）十三妹未得手刃殺父的仇人，還覺是件很大的遺憾。</p>

<p>閱讀本月十一日某報第四張有食河豚子中毒新聞一則，一苦力得一魚，八人共啖之，已死二人，餘六人尚在救治中，茲爲欲增長民衆健康知識起見，特將關於河隊之形態，其中毒現象及其避免方法略述如下：</p>
<p>（一）河豚之形態　河豚屬鯉類，鯉類魚體團而頭部顯小，鱗片或大或小不定，背有鰭，頭之下部有一厚硬角質片，口內除下顎骨上有强有力之臼齒外，並無他齒。此類魚口之邊緣，概有髯毛，生於淡水中，食小動物，鮮有食植物類者，東亞之常見者爲Cyprinuscarpio，口之上緣，有四髯毛，河豚Barbus　Vulgaris亦具四髯毛，其二生於口部尖端：其產卯期爲三至五月之間。</p>
<p>（二）食河豚子中毒現象及其原因　中河豚子毒者，幾遍及歐亞，而同時每有多數中毒死亡者，其原因在服食河豚魚卵子；其中毒現象，有謂之曰『河豚子虎列拉』Barbencholera者，蓋其病微有類似患虎列拉者也。主要者爲噁心，嘔吐，腹疼及瀉痢等；輕者可以救治，重者每致死亡。當十八世紀末數年，即一八八五年至一八九二年，日本衛生當局曾發表死於食魚中毒數達九百三十三人，其中死亡數爲六百八十一人，換言之，即死亡數佔中毒數之百分之七十三。魚子之最毒期爲其將下卵時，三月至五月，田原博士發現此等魚卵子內有毒素，即Tetrodonin及Tetrodonin酸是也。</p>
<p>救治法　亦若急性之腸胃炎然，少食少飲，用蓖麻油作瀉劑，重者宜用强心劑及生理食鹽水浸漬法，忌用止瀉劑！</p>
<p>疾病常識</p>
<h3 id="c125">胃病（三） <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— 莊畏仲</p>
<p>醫家　胃炎病人，所用診斷之法頗多，略述其槪，以供常識上之需要。無論急性慢性胃炎病人，醫家考查病史，異常詳盡，病人宜盡量供給，聽候醫家採取，蓋病史中有不少足爲診斷的參考資料，此外急性胃炎的吐出物，宜留待醫師檢查。又如慢性胃炎病人，雖不嘔吐，有時醫家欲用胃管取出其胃內容而付檢查，病家亦宜忍受（並無大苦），臨證所見，慢性胃炎病人，其胃液中常見胃酸分泌的失常，或减少，或加多，且存有大量黏液，不加檢查，何能臆測？其他如現症之陳述，詳簡貴乎得宜，凡醫家所問，宜一一詳答，不可稍有隱諱，亦不可過甚其詞。以上云云，凡胃病就醫者，均應有此常識，不僅患胃炎者如此。</p>
<p>至於患胃炎者的預後問題，雖不能一定，然與生命上的直接關係較少。急性胃炎，如即時用合理的治法，並遵守攝生規律，自能早占勿藥。反之則侵尋不治，易移行於慢性。其中毒性者，則所侵不特為胃的一局部，其胃解剖變化重篤者，毒物吸收者，皆有生命危險。慢性胃炎，時發時愈，電訴消化不良，厭食，或喜食，但淺嘗即止，於是營養上大受影響，身體羸瘦，精神上至不愉快，因之患神經衰弱的也很多（又神經衰弱病人，也往往合併慢性胃炎，這兩種病症，似乎有連環性存乎其中）。結果體重低下，天然抗病力减弱，易罹他疾，有時續發其他胃病（如癌等，或本係息癌，其初症狀未顯，視為慢性胃炎）。</p>
<p>最後一述胃炎的治法（但需申明者，此不過聊示治療的大槪，使閱者對於胃炎治療上多一常識，非使按圖索驥以求自療者，且此種疾病，在治療上亦需隨時斟酌，並無固定的方式）。凡急性胃炎，治療上首宜除去其原因，最好用溫水洗胃，洗胃宜用橡皮製胃管，洗胃用液，或用小蘇打水，或用常水（沸過），或用食鹽水，或用其他藥液，視症情而不同。其中毒性者（食物中毒，化學物中毒等），宜用相當的解毒藥，以謀中和，然酸及鹼類中毒，則禁止洗胃及用吐劑，恐胃穿孔之故。同時宜用瀉劑（酸，鹼類中毒則忌用），以資導便下行，以間接减少胃的炎症。急性症狀除去後，可用普通緩和健胃劑。對於胃痛，可用熱敷法，或用炒鹽袋燙熨，非萬不得已，戒用麻醉劑。嘔吐不甚者，可放任之，嘔吐不止，則斟酌用止吐之劑。熱度高者，斟酌情形，許用不礙消化的退熱藥，然急性胃炎的發熱，每隨其他症狀俱去，祇須除其內容，就原因上着想，熱之不十分高者，不必過慮。在治療中，宜飢餓二三日，二三日中，每日但飲許多開水。</p>
<p>慢性胃炎的治療，較急性者爲難。第一宜除去誘發的病因，第二口腔衛生，最爲緊要，宜時時漱口（急性胃炎亦然）。第三注重食養的改良，以富滋養易消化者爲最宜，時換口味，以引起食慾，每次攝食宜少不宜多，攝食的决數，可加多幾次。如病狀加重，可試用千分之三小蘇打水洗胃，但不可行之太久。病狀如有進步，可於食前半小時，用溫鹽湯一大杯。其餘如適當的運動及新鮮空氣等，也很重要。</p>

<h3 id="c126">診治肺炎與白喉併發症之經騐 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— 周振禹</p>
<p>緒言：余診治肺炎與白喉併發之症，雖有數起，但均莫若此次之危險，又不及此次之應手痊愈也。其所以然者，蓋吾人現有新藥，爲吾人治病之利器。茲故述之於下，以供研究焉。</p>
<p>病歷：孩童，男性。今年四歲，實足年齡，合爲三歲七個月。據其父吿知，於二月八日，該孩似不舒適，不愛玩耍，喜睡臥。父母以爲稍受風寒，禁食臥養足矣。夜半覺其身體火燒似的發熱，知非風寒，而爲病矣。翌晨（二月九日）帶往國醫某診視。該醫云，邪火侵襲，此乃冬瘟之一也。用袪邪降火藥，即可痊愈。旣服中藥，次日（二月十日）想必能减輕，不料病勢反似沉重，故又帶往該醫生處診視，該醫仍復前言，略改方劑，囑煎服之，遵照煎服後，病未見减輕，反較加重，沉眠不語，惟時有驚悸，呼吸短促，家中新喪其祖，孩童既不吵鬧，因未十分注意。次日（十一日）仍服中藥一貼，晚間睡眠不安，呼吸更形短促，時作張口吸氣狀，面色蒼白，故於十二日午後，又往復診，改方煎服後，似覺氣道中，有痰上下作響，張口吸氣之次數，似乎增多，因見喉中有痰，以爲藥達靈騐，痰出病除必矣。入夜更形不安，未曾睡眠一刻。次日（十三日）又服中藥一貼，其藥專主消化瘀痰，以爲痰去，則氣順。惟孩童精神更形萎困，面色蒼白更甚，張口吸氣之次數，增加更多，呼吸短促較急，至午後六七句鐘時，其呼吸聲音響亮，似有痰塊阻塞氣道。次日（十四日）又往複診，據云：痰瘀氣管中，痰化病除，此無疑意，應速進化痰藥劑，故又照方煎服一貼，未料其呼吸聲響，變本加厲，呼拉呼拉之聲，竟不絕於耳，且較響亮，張口吸氣之次數，又見增多，面色更形蒼白，且覺左胸下部疼痛，腹痛，以及頭痛。至十句鐘時，張口吸氣，每三四分鐘一次，竟有時不能接氣之槪，兩手緊握，挺胸後，深呼吸一次，似較平復，延至十二時，病况愈惡，故電請先生一診。</p>
<p>診察經過：余至時，已十二時一刻，應合爲十五日晨。視診：孩童身體健强，面色蒼白，病狀頗深，並不十分瘦弱，嘴唇烏紫，呈有窒息狀態，張口吸氣，每約二分鐘一次，每隔張口吸氣三五次，必有一次强呼吸（Forced　respiration），行此呼吸時，手必緊握，胸必挺直，嘴必張開，呼拉之聲頗宏，呼吸似甚艱難，且頗短促，鼻翼掀動，無時間斷，其父母深信爲痰所致，故要求用手術，將痰取出，以舒呼吸。余答以診察後再行商酌。肛門體溫爲10S.S°F，呼吸以胸腹顫動計數，爲50脈搏爲145，且甚細弱也</p>
<p>打診：右肺上部，至第四肋骨上緣，實空響聲雜半，左肺上部，至第三肋骨上緣，呈有實音響聲。</p>
<p>聽診：右肺病區，聞有破壺及枝管氣泡聲，左肺病區，聞有捻髮聲，及高度呼吸聲。由此觀之，右肺呈有第二期之徵象，左肺有第一期之徵象，同時，孩童聲稱在左胸下部疼痛，腹痛，頭痛。除近病區之處，呼吸之聲，略較宏大外，餘部均現有正常之徵象。綜合診察之結果，其爲大葉肺炎（Lobar　pueumonia），始於右肺，繼則左肺，無可疑矣。惟其呼吸，有呼拉之聲，顯有異物存在氣道中，時適白喉流行之際，故疑爲白喉作祟，但於診察咽喉時，唯見扁桃腺，腫大發炎外，並無特殊異狀，孩童哭鬧非常，診察較深之處，不易得也。故不得已，用嘴撐（Mouth　gag），撑開其口。始得發見左扁桃腺後，有假膜（pseudo-membrane）一大塊，呈黑灰色，適可成爲風箱式之活葉門，右腺後，亦有假膜一塊，惟較小而色較白耳。立即取粘液少許，送往病理化騐室檢騐，下午得其報吿書，證實爲白喉矣。（未完）</p>

<p>— 索非</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>夜深沈。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>顧師母從睡夢裏醒來，推了推睡在她身邊的顧先生，輕聲地喚：</p>
<p>「老顧！老顧！」</p>
<p>顧先生芷做着甜蜜的夢，他夢見他伴着愛妻在游西湖，那正是中秋的月夜，一輪晶瑩皎潔的明月高掛在靜夜的天空，一朵兩朶白雲，緩緩地來去，像一隻隻幸福的船在幸福的天海裏盪漾。這美景映在西湖的水裏，顯得這西湖更加美麗。他和他的愛妻坐着小型的畫舫，薄葉的槳輕輕撥着湖水，這畫舫緩緩地在湖面滑進。時間是深夜，湖面上的游艇已經稀少，只剩着疏疏落落的兩三艘了。像和天海的白雲爭勝似的，愈顯得景色的美麗。</p>
<p>船漸漸划近三潭印月，湖面上忽然現出三個圓圓的明月，連天空的一個，水底的一個，這五個皎皎的明月，彙成了千古未有，一時難再的奇觀。這美麗的幽靜的景色，把顧先生和額師母陶醉了，他們停了槳，緊緊地偎着，兩隻慧眼，同一個視綫，默默地欣賞着秋夜的西湖。</p>
<p>「老顧！老顧！」愛妻的親愛的喚聲，在顧先生的耳邊響着。</p>
<p>「哦！」顧先生熱情的應着，回頭看了看他的愛妻，面面情熱的臉互相碰個一碰，覺得熱烘烘的，彷彿有火在那裏燃燒一樣。</p>
<p>這一點熱的感覺使顧先生突然發見他們並不在美麗的西湖裏，郤睡着安適的床上，他是那麼安適地偎着他的愛妻睡着。</p>
<p>「什麼事呢？親愛的！」顧先生揉了揉惺忪的睡眼，柔情地問。</p>
<p>「我們的小千寄養在人家已經快三年了，我們從來不曾去望過他，我剛纔夢着他來」顧師母喚醒了顧先生，訴述她的夢境說「他是多麼可愛啊！又白又胖，又活潑，又聰明，他一看見我，立刻奔了來撲在我的懷裏，親熱得像自小在一起的一樣。我問他想媽不，他說想得很呢，他並且還常常想念着他的爸爸哩。——」</p>
<p>聽說自己的孩子養育得很好，顧先生從心底裏湧起一陣聖天使的歡樂與安慰，但一想到自己已經是五個孩子的父親，十歲的大千，八歲的又千六歲的中千，這三個孩子已經在一個小學裏讀書，四歲的也千，正預備送他到幼稚園去，這四個拖在身邊的孩子的學膳費用已經可觀，一家人只有他一個人在出賣勞力，賺錢使用，祖上又不曾遺下一些產業，這副重祖是够他肩挑的了。小千雖然是值得可愛，但一想到將來的重担，他的心郤不自覺地沈重起來。</p>
<p>「我想我們還是早一點把他領回來吧，」顧師母仰着頭，在追憶着她的愛子的笑貌，不曾注意到顧先生的心事，「孩子寄養在外邊，年齡過分大了，將會對親生的父母不親熱哩。」</p>
<p>「不見得吧，」顧先生記起了行將加壓上來的重担，心想能够躱避一時算一時，「親子的感情究竟是天性，即使再多寄養幾年，料也不至於就會變性的吧。」</p>
<p>「不，我看見過好幾份人家把孩子寄養在別處，年代隔得久了，到後來竟然完全不親熱。不要我們的小千寄養得太久了，將來也會不和我們親熱哩。」</p>
<p>「我不相信，」顧先生明知道顧師母的話語有幾分眞實，但想用一些非議的話來遏止他的愛妻的思兒之念，讓這副丟不掉的重擔遲一些時候，肩負起來，「你剛才不是說他和你很親熱的嗎？」</p>
<p>「那究竟不過是一個夢，夢境與事實也許是恰恰相反的，」顧師母不曾明瞭顧先生的心，打破了他的企圖說：「因爲這個緣故，我更想着應該早一些去把他領回來，免得將來眞會鬧到不親熱哩。」</p>
<p>「遲些時候去領回來不好嗎？」顧先生無可奈何，變成懇求似的語氣說：「你的身體又不大好，在身邊的孩子已經够你麻煩了，你何苦亟亟去找出麻煩來呢？再遲些時候去領回來，孩子比較大了，不是可以减少些麻煩嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，我太想念他了，你一定替我去領回來！」顧師母然心思念他的幼子，並不曾回味一下顧先生的話語，撒嬌地一定要顧先生把他們的愛兒立刻從寄養的人家領回來。</p>
<p>顧先生太愛顧師母，他不忍讓他的愛妻有一點不舒服，對於這個問題，雖然將會在他的全副重擔之內加添若干重量，雖然將會使體弱的愛妻增加煩累，但他仔細考慮一下，終於接受了愛妻的提議。</p>
<p>「那末，我明天就去領他回來吧，」顧先生這樣說時，顧師母立刻歡喜起來，一把抱住顧先生，偎得更緊。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>顧師母的懸想竟然是一個事實。</p>
<p>顧先生路遠迢迢把他們的幼子小千從一個小鄕村裏領了回來，人並不像顧師母夢裏看見的那樣白胖，那樣活潑，反倒是面黃肌瘦，頭兒小小，眼睛却很大，手骨和脚骨，都細得像柴，一個肚子却高高地凸起來，像一個鼓足了氣的皮球。更且有一個異乎尋常的習性，他歡喜挖取墻壁上粉飾着的石灰塊，挖到的時候，就塞進嘴裏，非常有味地嚼着吃了。這樣一個奇怪的孩子，在他們的兒女中間，從來沒有一個像小千這樣情形的，把小千雜在兒女中間觀看起來，異乎尋常地，簡直不像是他們的兒子。</p>
<p>小千雖然年紀還不足三歲，但對於他的生身的父母已經完全不認識，雖然善意地敎導他說「這是爸爸」，「這是媽媽」，他却靦顏地呆呆地站着，不肯呌一聲。</p>
<p>「陌陌人！陌陌人！」顧先生或顧師母和他親熱的時候，他却這樣嚷着哭起來了。</p>
<p>顧先生和顧師母感到後悔起來，他們後悔貪圖一時的爽利，在二年半以前把自己親生下來才三個月的孩子寄養到人家去。歡喜孩子雖然是人的天性，人家雖然一樣也愛撫着孩子，可是終究不是自己親生的，這中間隔了一層，難免就不能够照顧得周到。孩子是需要成人們的愛護的，冷呀，熱呀，飢呀，飽呀，這日常生活的煩瑣，只有親生的父母，才能够耐心地接受下來，不怕煩累。</p>
<p>顯然的，小千的形態，決不是正常的，每到下午還有一點熱，發熱的時候，稍微有一點氣喘，這就使父母的心加添了無窮的憂慮。</p>
<p>「請個醫生看看吧，這孩子每天發着熱，許是患着瘧疾了吧，」顧師母看着這奇形怪狀的孩子，疼愛多於憐恤，向顧先生徵求同意說：「聽說鄕下蚊蟲多，患瘧疾是難免的呀。」（未完）</p>

<p>British Ambassadors to China and Japan</p>
<h3 id="e6">To Hold Conference in Shanghai; Purpose is to Deal with Japan; Japanese Newspaper Predicts Increased Pressure on Japan After the Meeting; Urges its Government to Change Strategy <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Nichi Nichi Shimbun claimed that the British ambassadors to China and Japan will hold a conference in Shanghai. Their purpose is to undermine Japan's attempt to build a new order in East Asia. The British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, set off from Yokohama on Sunday for Shanghai to discuss everything with the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. The newspaper urged Japan to completely and immediately change its policy towards Britain, and recounted the political and economic activities of Britain in China in the years after the British government's economic advisor, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, went to China to reform the Chinese currency system. The newspaper further pointed to Sir Miles Lampson (former British Ambassador to China), Mr. Hall-Patch (Financial Advisor to British Embassy in China) and Sir Victor Sassoon and Mr. Woodhead, as figures involved in activities in China. The newspaper also stated that, given Britain's past actions, it is expected that after Craigie and Kerr meet in Shanghai, Britain's pressure on Japan will increase, and Britain's dreams of destroying Japan's military in China will likely be prolonged. The newspaper strongly stated that now is an opportune time to re-examine Japan's policy towards Britain and make appropriate corrections, saying "Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Britain's policy has been aimed at placing economic obstacles in Japan's path, hoping for the collapse of Japan's economy and finances. Unless the Sino-Japanese War ends, Britain will continue this policy." The newspaper also predicted that Britain will continue to assist General Chiang Kai-shek's government, while also trying to persuade other democratic countries to jointly intervene in Japan's policy towards China in order to maintain Britain's power and interests in China.

<p>(Xi'an) Seventeen Japanese aircraft bombed the southern district of Xi'an again at 9:50 AM on the 3rd, dropping forty-five bombs, heading east and passing over Weinan. One bomb was dropped in Bayi Town, but it landed in an empty field.

Seven civilians were killed, and over thirty were injured. Over one hundred and twenty houses were bombed and damaged. (Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Guilin: Seven Japanese aircraft flew over Hepu and its vicinity to drop bombs on the 2nd. Also, at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 1st, twenty-nine Japanese aircraft in two batches raided Nanning, dropping dozens of bombs in the suburbs and villages before fleeing. (Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Seven Japanese aircraft dropped over 5,000 bombs in Xi'an City today. The Great Hall of the British Baptist Church was destroyed. Among the bombs dropped by the Japanese aircraft, two were incendiary bombs, and the fires caused were difficult to extinguish. Six people were killed and seven injured. Xi'an residents have now developed the habit of leaving the city early in the morning, which may be the reason for the small number of casualties. A bomb hit the Drum Tower, and the building of a certain newspaper in the city has been destroyed. The material losses suffered by the commercial district are very heavy.

<h3 id="e9">From Axis to Triangle <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>American journalist T. A. Bisson recently published an article entitled "From Axis to Triangle." This title can be borrowed for use, because the recent turbulent international situation is rapidly revolving around this "axis" and "triangle."</p>
<p>In Europe, the changes in the international situation are as fast as a dream. In the last ten days alone, Czechoslovakia is gone; Memel has been annexed; peaceful Spain has been painted in Fascist colors; Romania has been burdened with the weight of a semi-colony; and Poland is painfully feeling the danger of Nazi troops pressing on the border... From Austria to Czechoslovakia, from Czechoslovakia to Memel to Romania or Poland, this series of tragedies or disasters, this wolf-like attack on the European continent, is all caused by the German-Italian axis of aggression. Hitler and Mussolini seem to be engaged in a competition of aggression. They use "intimidation" as a tool, boast of their axis, and collude to plunder the interests of Britain, France, and other weaker countries. Mussolini just finished a set of intimidation, and Hitler came up with another set. They take turns in this way, rising and falling. Under the appeasement policy of the British and French rulers, the aggressive offensive of the Berlin-Rome axis is obviously expanding and increasingly endangering the security and interests of Britain and France.</p>
<p>True, there are contradictions between Germany and Italy, and with Hitler's expansion in Central and Southern Europe, these contradictions are deepening day by day. Germany and Italy have contradictions in Central Europe and in the Balkan Peninsula. Now, Austria and Czechoslovakia have indeed fallen into Hitler's grasp, and Italy's power in the Balkans has been completely swept away. Hitler's step-by-step expansion of power in Central and Southern Europe is undoubtedly a thorn in Mussolini's back.</p>
<p>However, this contradictory force will not break up or weaken the collusion between Germany and Italy at present; on the contrary, this deepening contradiction between Italy and Germany will inevitably expand and intensify the aggressive offensive of the German-Italian axis to the outside world. Why? There is a reason for this.</p>
<p>First of all, from Abyssinia to Spain, Italy's feet are sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire; while Hitler took Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Memel without spending a single soldier. In this regard, the "Brownshirt brother" is undoubtedly stronger than his "Blackshirt brother." Due to Hitler's relative strengthening, Mussolini has become increasingly a German appendage in diplomacy. Mussolini's speech at the end of last month had a telephone conversation with Hitler beforehand. From this fact alone, it can be seen that Berlin controls Rome. From Mussolini's praise of the German-Italian axis and from Italy's need to rely on Hitler, it can be determined that Mussolini currently dares not break with Germany.</p>
<p>Second, from Hitler's point of view, it is the same. He needs Italy to act as Germany's watchdog, using it to attack Britain and France from the Mediterranean in order to strengthen his "blackmail" momentum. Goering said: "Each step of Germany's expansion of power is also a step in the increase of Italy's power; each step in the increase of Italy's power is also a step in the expansion of Germany's power." Hitler's speech the day before yesterday specifically stated: "The relationship between the Axis countries is more solid than any agreement between other countries."</p>
<p>Therefore, third, although the contradictions between Germany and Italy are deepening, they still need to mutually boast of cooperation on the basis of aggression; Mussolini has suffered a loss in front of his powerful ally, and in order to avoid conflict, he can only turn to Britain and France, who are still unable to stand up straight, to seek compensation, and this is precisely the joint strategy of the anti-communist group led by Hitler. In a word, the deepening contradictions between Italy and Germany have promoted Italy to intensify its attacks on Britain and France from the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Not only that. This European axis of aggression has also expanded to the Far East, forming a triangular relationship with Japanese imperialism. This aggressive "triangle" was initially formed on November 6, 1937, with the "Anti-Comintern Pact." More recently, this aggressive triangle has been further expanded and strengthened. Like Italy, Japanese imperialism, weakened by the war against China, has increasingly been reduced to Hitler's appendage in diplomacy. The Zhanggufeng Incident taught the Japanese warlords a lesson; the Soviet Union's head cannot be touched; the Munich Incident also hinted to the Japanese warlords; Britain and France are weak and can be deceived. At the same time, within Japan, due to the failure of the Kwantung Army, the Navy's southward advance theory is gradually rising; Arita, who advocated strengthening the "Anti-Comintern Pact," succeeded Yosuke Matsuoka, who had coordinated diplomacy with Britain and France. In this way, the Japanese warlords changed their strategy from attacking the north to advancing south, and in early February of this year, they first occupied Hainan Island, an important base in the Pacific Ocean. This happened to be implementing Hitler's will. Because this move not only threatened the interests and status of Britain, France, and the United States, but also allowed them to peer into the Indian Ocean from Hainan Island, connect with Germany and Italy, and create a new triangular situation for the anti-communist group.</p>
<p>The situation created by the Hainan Island Incident is extremely serious. However, the British and French authorities did not make any stronger representation than to lodge a few protests. This naturally encouraged the aggressors. Recently, Japanese warlords have simply intensified their collusion with Germany and Italy and further infringed upon the interests of Britain and France. We can use the facts of the past few days to prove this: First, the Spratly Islands (Sprattley Is.) belonging to France were occupied by the Japanese army again on March 31. The Spratly Islands are south of Hainan Island, only four hours by plane from Singapore, and only one hour from French Indochina and British Borneo. The threat to Britain, France, the United States, and the Netherlands is naturally very great; Second, the anti-British movement in the occupied areas is becoming more and more intense, and even the church is being discriminated against by the puppets. This is clearly an ugly drama directed by the Japanese warlords; Third, it was rumored in Berlin a few days ago that Japan would return Qingdao and the Caroline Islands under trusteeship to Germany. This is precisely Japan's attempt to curry favor with Germany and intensify its collusion. In short, this "anti-communist" triangle led by Hitler, whose activities in Europe and Asia are parallel lines, has never been as exposed as it is today. Japan's attacks on British and French interests in the Far East are echoing with Italy in the Mediterranean and Germany in Central Europe. They all have the same purpose: to encircle and overthrow the two major democratic countries of Britain and France. Therefore, how urgent is the task for Britain, France, and other peaceful countries to jointly build a stronger fortress to resist the expansion of this axis or triangle today!</p>
<p>Observations from Chongqing</p>
<h3 id="e10">If European War Breaks Out; Japan Will Seize Concessions; Take Parallel Action to Support Germany; Use Economic Methods to Plunder Land <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to reliable military observers, once war breaks out between the totalitarian countries and democratic countries in Europe, Japan will take an offensive against Britain and France in the Far East, while taking a defensive stance against the Soviet Union, which has the possibility of an offensive. Japan's offensive against the Far East territories of Britain and France has two purposes: (1) To take parallel action to support Germany; (2) To conquer more land in the most economical way. The Japanese army intends to repeat the experience of 1915, defeating the small German garrison in Qingdao and occupying the area. Japan's current goal is to occupy all of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, the French concessions in Shanghai and Hankou, the International Settlement in Shanghai and Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and the French leased territory of Guangzhou Bay. The Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island is the preliminary preparation for completing its military ambitions. The Japanese army's occupation of the Spratly Islands has completed its preparations for attacking the British and French territories in the Far East. Now that the Japanese army has occupied Hainan Island and the Spratly Islands, it can prevent reinforcements and supplies from Singapore to Hong Kong. Now that the waterways to Singapore and Hong Kong have been cut off, the British troops in Shanghai and Tianjin are in a completely isolated position. Japanese statisticians believe that there are only less than twelve old-fashioned French warships along the coast of Vietnam and Guangzhou Bay, and the small number of French troops stationed in the French concessions in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou are insufficient to be a fighting force. The Japanese believe that once war breaks out, the French forces in the Far East will have no source of reinforcements and supplies. The Japanese hope to achieve the greatest effect at the least cost, so they are not prepared to fight the Soviet Union unless the Soviet Union attacks. It is reported that Japanese Minister of War Itagaki intends to take a plane to inspect the defense fortifications in the Northeast. The Japanese troops stationed in the Northeast have increased to twenty-four divisions, totaling 500,000. Even the southern part of Sakhalin Island has two Japanese divisions stationed there. There are three Japanese divisions stationed in northern Korea. There are a total of thirteen Japanese divisions on the eastern border of the Northeast, including the Snowy Mountains on the west bank of the Ussuri River. (Associated Press dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e11">Japanese Side Continues to Block the Pearl River Under the Pretext of Military Operations; Allows British Ships Blocked in Guangzhou to Depart After Unloading Cargo <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) A Japanese military spokesman explained several reasons for the continued blockade of the Pearl River at his second reception for reporters here. It is claimed that military operations are still underway along the river. Secrecy is one of the keys to victory in battle, so ships are not allowed to travel to and from the areas where the Japanese army is operating. At this time, allowing ships to freely navigate the river would greatly hinder the Japanese army. The Japanese army has to frequently consider the issue of safety. The Pearl River will only be opened when military operations permit. Regarding the blocking of a small number of British ships in Guangzhou, the spokesman said that each ship was carrying cargo, and they will be allowed to depart after unloading their cargo. When answering other questions, the spokesman admitted that the order to force Chinese people to wear "good citizen badges" in order to curb crime had failed. The Japanese army and navy authorities now know that this system is ineffective and are considering abolishing it. The Japanese authorities hope to abolish the method of requiring foreigners to hold passes when entering Guangzhou from Shamian in the shortest possible time. The spokesman also said that although the local maintenance association enjoys greater freedom than similar groups in North China, the administration must listen to the guidance of a group led by a Japanese person. The Japanese person's name is Nishimura, who was formerly the director of the Local Administration Bureau of the Taiwan government. He is currently organizing a committee to handle the most difficult issue of restoring property to its original owners. Private houses that have been requisitioned by the army and navy will not be returned, but the owners will be compensated for their losses. (Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>

<p>(London) Today, the House of Commons held a debate on foreign affairs, which began with a speech by Labour Deputy Leader Colin Wu. Prime Minister Chamberlain declared that Great Britain is now united and believes that whatever the outcome, we must have a clear and unambiguous position. If Germany is a good neighbor in the long run, it will not threaten others. The declaration issued by the government on Friday is the greatest new departure in Great Britain's history. We have now broken away from traditionalism. If Poland is threatened, Britain and France intend to come to its aid immediately. Germany's guarantees are like wind passing through the ears and have completely destroyed the trust of other countries, forcing Britain to take this new departure. If Germany continues its policies, it will not be just Poland that suffers. Britain welcomes any country to cooperate and resist aggression, regardless of its political system. The entire British Empire has endorsed the government's new policies and hopes that the actions already started but not completed by the government will prove to be a turning point towards a better era. (3rd Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax emphatically stated in the House of Lords today that the British and French governments are now in extremely close contact, and the two governments are as one on all points. Halifax detailed the scope and purpose of the guarantee given to Poland by Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons on February 31, and said that the British government attaches great importance to the value of friendship with the Soviet Union, but the British government should pay attention to the fact that the relations between several countries and the Soviet Union are currently very complicated. As far as the British government is concerned, there are no such disputes with the Soviet Union today. There are now several parties pointing out that the British government intends to encircle Germany, which is a great distortion of the facts. If Germany indicates that the fear of its neighbors only arises from misunderstandings of Germany's intentions, then it is difficult to expect these neighbors to completely ignore the lessons of the past. (Cheers from the crowd) The guarantee given to Poland by the British government is indeed a major new departure in British policy. This kind of constraint is by no means shouldered in any hostile spirit. Senator Snell said that he would like to assure the government that the Labor Party welcomes the government's change of policy. Senator Cree also said that he agrees with the government's new policies, but National Labor Party Senator Arnold alone dissented, saying that history will prove this to be the most unwise and dangerous decision the British government has ever made. The discussion ended as soon as the senator finished speaking. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Mandell, a Liberal MP from the opposition party, raised a question about the Free City of Danzig. Butler, a decision-maker at the Foreign Office, immediately replied, "Colonel Beck, the Foreign Minister of Poland, has now arrived here. When the British Cabinet members conduct talks with him, this matter will naturally be discussed, but before the talks, it is not appropriate to make any announcements. I believe you will agree. As for what can be reported at present, it is that the British government has not yet received any report from the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, regarding the High Commissioner stationed in Danzig." Conservative MP Bodbi then asked, "The Times published an editorial on the first of this month, stating that the government's guarantee to Poland does not apply to the country's current borders. I wonder if the government can also state that this statement is inaccurate?" Butler replied, "Regarding this guarantee, the Foreign Office has already issued an official statement explaining the government's views." (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The local newspapers comment on the visit of Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck to the UK, recognizing this as the first step in a policy of peace-loving countries uniting to resist aggression. The Times editorial states that Colonel Beck's visit to the UK will be to engage in the courageous cause of defending European law and the independence of all countries with Britain and France. European freedom has now been invaded. Democratic countries are now accepting this challenge. It is reported that Poland is prepared to negotiate with Germany on certain issues related to Danzig.

<h3 id="e15">The Twists and Turns of Hitler's Speech Suddenly Being Interrupted <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) German officials have now explained the reason for yesterday's decision not to broadcast Hitler's speech, saying that the time of the speech may not attract the majority of the audience, so it was decided to make a gramophone record and broadcast it during the dinner of most people. As for the sudden interruption of the broadcast on the shortwave radio station to the United States, it was due to a technical error. However, non-official sources said that Hitler had already prepared a more broadly worded speech, containing remarks about having a special relationship with the United States. Later, due to British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons, the speech was rewritten, focusing solely on Britain and deleting the points specifically related to the United States. Therefore, it was temporarily decided to stop broadcasting to the United States, but due to a technical error, part of the speech was still broadcast into the air. Hitler's speech was delivered orally, and the official original text was not published until Hitler carefully studied it on the Robley ship. However, there is not much difference between the official written speech and the speech broadcast on the gramophone record. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e16">Britons Baffled by Hitler's Speech; Berlin Says the Intention Was to Mock Britain into Abandoning its Policy of Encirclement <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(London) The general reaction of Britons to Hitler's speech can be summarized as follows: "Hitler has made us more confused than before, but has not made us more troubled." Some newspapers welcomed it because Hitler did not abolish the Anglo-German naval agreement and his speech did not have the great rage and belligerence expected by the outside world. Other newspapers expressed surprise because Hitler was able to exercise considerable restraint in issuing this "oral fireworks." The Sunday Express published a commentary by Baxter, calling Hitler's speech a weak reply to Chamberlain and saying that Hitler's speech was intended to comfort his own people, not for the intelligent. However, the words of blame and the completely incongruous words were only intended to please the immature hearts of the general youth who revered him as sacred for a moment. Hitler's speech can be called "self-restraint," and it was issued in a mysterious and extraordinary atmosphere. The chaotic broadcasting arrangement was bizarre. The Times stated that Hitler stated in a sad tone that he intended to threaten others and declared that what he sought was non-interference from other countries. If Hitler could put himself in others' shoes and not interfere in other countries, we would all be grateful. A careful reading of yesterday's speech did not excite or comfort people. We still have hope for preserving peace, which lies in cooperation, not isolation. Peace-loving countries, if united and not scattered, will stand invincible. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Political figures here recently declared that British public opinion has always considered the constraints accepted by Britain in Central Europe as impossible. Now, due to the guarantee of Poland, it has come to fruition. It can be seen that Prime Minister Chamberlain is the most suitable person for British politicians to accept this constraint in the name of the country. If the combination of Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey to form a group to resist future aggression and the Soviet Union providing material assistance is to be completed, Prime Minister Chamberlain is also the most suitable person. Today, the policies implemented by the British government are not only supported by political figures across the country, but also by the various autonomous regions that hesitated before the Munich Conference, which now unanimously express their support. An important figure in the Conservative Party said that the Prime Minister's position has become more consolidated, and there is no need for a change. Since the Prime Minister was deceived at the Munich Conference, he must learn from the past and make a thorough change. In short, "The Prime Minister has thoroughly realized the ineffectiveness of the policy of concession." He is naturally the most suitable person to lead the group and promote new policies in the future. (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Well-informed German sources said that Hitler's remarks were directed specifically at Britain and contained peaceful remarks of warning. A commentator said that Hitler wanted peace and at the same time gave a stern warning to Chamberlain's explicit or implicit policy of encirclement. The Germans do not believe that this policy is defensive. Germany is preparing for peace, but is not preparing to be encircled. Germany will never allow anyone to put a rope around its neck without acting. German newspapers all emphasized the danger of the policy of encirclement and said that Hitler has given Britain time to consider it calmly. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Cleveland: Former President of the Czech Republic, Beneš, and Mayor of New York, LaGuardia, gave speeches here yesterday, both saying that the Czech Republic would not perish and that the Czech Republic would be able to restore its independence. Beneš said, "We will be able to win, in other words, a free Europe will be able to win, because our country is too prosperous and too democratic in the eyes of its neighbors. The dictators will never want to be neighbors with a prosperous democratic country." It is gratifying that US Deputy Secretary of State Welles recently issued a declaration refusing to recognize Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic. I do not advocate resisting violence with violence, but certain countries in Central Europe have recently followed in the footsteps of the Czech Republic and are in a state of disintegration spiritually and socially. The world has seen this and has already felt the need to curb it. Otherwise, human civilization will be completely destroyed. Mayor LaGuardia said, "I don't want to imitate diplomatic language. I will speak frankly, 'The Czech Republic did not perish because of defeat, and its republican government did not collapse. It was just kidnapped by thugs. The looters even speak of protective areas. Their actions are actually the same as kidnapping a young child and temporarily protecting it, waiting for the parents to pay the ransom. Otherwise, the ticket will be torn up. How is this different? How can this kind of crime be allowed to be exposed for a long time and then respected?'" At this point, if we can announce to the world that the American people condemn the aggressors and help the democratic countries, we can believe that war can be avoided. People are now commenting on Beneš's speech, saying that he did not involve the Czech reconstruction plan currently under study. This is probably due to keeping secrets. However, according to well-informed sources, the Czech people will organize a provisional government abroad, and the Czech embassy in foreign countries that has not yet been handed over to Germany will be the location of the provisional government.

<p>Frequent Contacts Between Britain and Italy; Content Strictly Kept Secret</p>
<p>(Rome) The semi-official Stefani news agency issued a communiqué today stating that Sir Charles, the British Chargé d'Affaires, delivered the full text of Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration on the guarantee of Poland to Foreign Minister Ciano on the 31st of last month. Diplomatic circles here are now commenting on this communiqué, saying that recent rumors that the British government advocated convening an international conference to organize European peace, and Chargé d'Affaires Charles notified Foreign Minister Ciano of this intention. It is not known whether the intention of the communiqué issued by the Stefani news agency is to indirectly deny these rumors. However, since Prime Minister Chamberlain made his declaration, Chargé d'Affaires Charles and Foreign Minister Ciano have held a total of three talks. The first two talks were on the 31st of last month, and the third was yesterday morning. The agency did not mention a single word about the second and third talks, which is noteworthy. Well-informed sources said that the diplomatic activities between Britain and Italy recently are of extreme importance. It is reasonable for the Italian government to keep secrets before the negotiations between the two sides are completed. (2nd Havas)</p>
<p>Britain to Establish a Ministry of Supply</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons this afternoon that the government is considering establishing a Ministry of Supply. He then replied to an inquiry from Labor MP Henderson that the information received by London regarding the transportation of German troops and arms to Italy is not sufficient to be considered conclusive evidence.

<h3 id="e18">Japan and Russia Establish Temporary Fisheries Agreement; Valid Until the End of This Year; Russia Recovers 27 Fishing Grounds <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement was signed on April 2 by Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov and Japanese Ambassador Togo, with a limited period until the end of 1939. At the same time, the auction of fishing grounds originally scheduled to be held in Vladivostok on April 3 has been postponed to April 4 for technical reasons. (3rd Tass Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Union and Japan have now reached an agreement to slightly revise the 1928 Fisheries Treaty and extend its validity for one year. The fisheries dispute has thus come to an end. According to Japanese sources, when the Soviet authorities auction 254 fishing grounds in Vladivostok Port on the 4th of this month, Japanese fisheries will also participate. The operating period of these fishing grounds has been set for one year. Another 105 will be subject to special agreements between the two parties, allowing Japanese companies to operate for a term of one year. There are still 27 that were originally operated by Japanese companies and have been taken back by the Soviet Union to be operated independently (the Soviet Union originally wanted to take back 40). The rent paid by the Japanese side has been increased by 10 percent, an increase of 300,000 yen. It is also said that the fishing grounds originally operated by the Japanese can be taken back by the Soviet Union to be operated independently. This has been recognized by the Japanese side. That is, the 105 fishing grounds allowed to be operated by the Japanese are not as valuable as the 27 taken back. In addition, the Japanese side has always refused to accept the principle of price-cutting, but now it has made concessions. All of this is where the Soviet Union's victory lies.

<p>Belgian Parliament Re-Election Results; Pro-German Faction Suffers a Miserable Defeat</p>
<p>Beijing: The re-election of the Belgian Senate and House of Representatives has now been completed. According to the official final report, the number of seats held by each party in the two houses is as follows:</p>
<p>House of Representatives, a total of 202 seats, Catholic Party 73 seats increased by 10 seats Social Democratic Party 64 seats decreased by 6 seats Liberal Party 23 seats increased by 10 seats Flemish Nationalist Party 17 seats increased by 1 seat Communist Party 9 seats remained the same Rex party 4 seats decreased by 17 seats Independent Party 1 seat New Joined Legion Representative 1 seat New Joined Senate total of 101 seats Catholic Party 38 seats increased by 4 seats Social Democratic Party 35 seats decreased by 4 seats Liberal Party 16 seats increased by 5 seats Flemish Party 8 seats increased by 3 seats Communist Party 3 seats decreased by 1 seat Lech Party 1 seat decreased by 7 seats Representatives of the Provincial Councils 44 seats, not yet elected,</p>
<p>Occupational Proportional Representation 22 seats, announced on April 12th. (3rd Haitong Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beijing: Regarding the re-election of the Belgian Senate and House of Representatives, political figures here commented today, believing that there are several characteristics: (1) The success of the Catholic Party, with an increase of 10 seats in the House of Representatives and an increase of 4 seats in the Senate, becoming the most powerful party in both houses; (2) The decline of the Communist Party; (3) The miserable defeat of the Rex Party, but the party leader Degrelle was elected as a member of the House of Representatives for the first time; (4) The expansion of the Liberal Party, with an increase of 10 seats in the House of Representatives and an increase of 5 seats in the Senate. As a result, if the Catholic Party unites with the Liberal Party, it will become an absolute majority, so it is expected that the two parties will form a coalition cabinet. (3rd Haitong Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beijing: The characteristic of this election is the great failure of the Lex Party, which has dropped from 21 seats to 4 seats. This party does not have a concrete political program in diplomacy, but its attitude is friendly to Germany and opposes the League of Nations. The party leader Degrelle is accused of wanting to establish a dictatorship, but Degrelle denies it. However, it is generally believed that the purpose of the Lex movement is to create a kind of dictatorial state. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Former Polish Prime Minister Suddenly Commits Suicide</p>
<p>Warsaw: Former Polish Prime Minister Colonel Sławek suddenly committed suicide last night for unknown reasons. According to historical accounts, Mr. Sławek was a confidant of the late Polish President General Piłsudski, 59 years old, and has made many contributions to Poland's independence and revolutionary movement. In 1900, he met Piłsudski for the first time in Łódź and joined the work of resisting Russian rule. During the World War, he was repeatedly promoted to important positions under Piłsudski. After 1918, he was actually responsible for organizing the army. He then replaced Piłsudski to form a "non-party group" and occupied a very powerful position in the parliament. After 1930, Mr. Sławek served as Prime Minister of the Cabinet three times. He left his political career last year and went to a villa near Kielce, a gift from the state, to recuperate.

<h3 id="e19">A GlimPSE BEFORE THE FALL OF MADRID <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>ANDAYE, SOUTHERN FRANCE - The situation in the Spanish city of Madrid in the last few days before the Nationalist troops entered was personally witnessed by a Havas News Agency reporter. According to the reporter, who arrived here today, the sudden fall of the city was actually due to the fact that the former Republican government had already advocated peace talks, which led to wavering public sentiment and an eager hope for peace, forming a kind of mass psychology that peace would end the daily air raid terrors, food would flow in, and daily life would no longer be precarious. Therefore, after the suppression of the Communist Party incident, soldiers stationed on the front lines and in various military camps, as well as workers in various ordnance factories, deserted their posts one after another, and there was a sense of stagnation in the market. Unexpectedly, the peace talks ultimately failed. The Republican government authorities held repeated meetings, and opinions were divided, with disputes becoming increasingly fierce. Initially, when the anarchist faction sponsored the formation of the National Defense Committee, there was an understanding that those not tolerated by the Nationalist troops should be given sufficient time to retreat at ease before the Nationalist troops arrived. Later, because various countries were unwilling to accept these people, the meetings came to nothing. Finally, Foreign Minister Pascual and Army Minister Colonel Casado rose up to support the precarious situation, believing that they could ultimately obtain an honorable peace. However, the result was again not the case. The Nationalist troops adopted a tough stance, with absolutely no room for compromise. Until the 25th of last month, those not tolerated by the Nationalist troops received orders to leave the city. At the same time, government troops engaged in eliminating traitors also withdrew one after another. Soon after, the Republican government received an ultimatum issued by General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist troops, demanding unconditional surrender. Prime Minister Miaja then, at 4:00 AM the next morning, led General Matallana, chief of staff of the Central Army, and flew to Valencia. The hope for peace talks was thus clearly dashed. By the evening of the 26th, the Republican government authorities issued a communiqué, announcing the other side's ultimatum and the Prime Minister's flight. The next day, the general situation in Madrid, although no different from the past, saw soldiers fleeing constantly. Even officers at all levels found it difficult to leave the city. When Colonel Casado heard the news, he initially planned to prohibit all cars from leaving the city. However, because public panic reached its peak, the ban was as good as a dead letter. By the evening of the 27th, Colonel Casado, seeing that the situation was hopeless, accepted the ultimatum. At that time, out of the 50,000 government troops on the front lines of Madrid, more than half had fled. Only 23,000 remained, still stationed in their original defenses. The Nationalist troops' entry by taking advantage of the situation was entirely possible. All extremist elements would inevitably take the opportunity to cause trouble. Therefore, they appealed to Viglison, leader of the Falange Party, who had been in hiding for thirteen months, to come forward to maintain order. At the same time, a movement to support General Franco began, the aim being that, when the Nationalist troops entered the city, they would not resume fighting. At this point, Colonel Casado left the city, leaving only Foreign Minister Pascual to deal with the aftermath (he is currently detained by the Nationalist authorities). That evening, all members of the Falange Party in Madrid secretly mobilized. Red berets and flags of the Restoration faction were simultaneously seen throughout the city. By dawn on the 28th, residents woke up to see a white flag hoisted high on the roof of the Information Bureau, fluttering in the wind. They looked at each other sadly. At that time, those who supported the Nationalist troops cheered as if they were in ecstasy, rushing to the embassies of various countries, shouting "Long live General Franco!" "Long live Spain!" And rumors of the signing of a peace treaty spread throughout the city. Soon after, a first batch of children, mostly girls, rode together in a truck, driving through the streets, shouting "Long live General Franco!" However, the city's residents, having endured long periods of artillery fire, took it all calmly. By 2:00 PM, the situation in the city had calmed down slightly. Soon after, supporters of the Nationalist troops gathered again, with three to four thousand residents from across the city participating. By 6:00 PM, the vanguard of the Nationalist troops entered the city, and by 9:00 PM that evening, they had occupied the entire city. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>MADRID - According to information obtained here, after the Nationalist troops occupied Madrid, they detained 300,000 former government soldiers in concentration camps near Madrid, including many former members of the International Brigades, mostly volunteers from Russia, France, Belgium, and the United States. The number of former government officials arrested reached over 2,000, including National Defense Council member Pascual, Prime Minister's Office Secretary Guerra, and two political police chiefs.

<p>SOUTHWESTERN FACTORIES SPRING UP</p>
<h3 id="e20">GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHES MANAGEMENT OFFICE IN XIKANG PROVINCE - TO MINE GOLD - 300 FACTORIES MOVE INLAND - OVERSEAS CHINESE INVEST IN MINING DEVELOPMENT <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing correspondence from the Continental News on March 19th states that the resources and raw materials in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces are extremely abundant. Before the Sino-Japanese War, few people inquired about them. Now, state-owned and private factories are being established one after another, and their number is increasing daily. This can serve as a concrete example of the gradual industrialization of southwestern China. From October of last year to March of this year, government agencies have established no fewer than 12 large factories, with a total capital of tens of millions of yuan. There are also some other factories that will soon be opened. In addition, there are at least</p>
<p>300 factories</p>
<p>that have moved in from overseas and the provinces of Central China. According to this, the remote inland provinces have enjoyed peace and tranquility for several centuries. Today, this traditional tranquility has been invaded by the roar of machines and the activities of workers. This action is particularly noticeable in Sichuan Province, where China's factory construction process has achieved considerable results. The most important of the factories established in the inland provinces are some state-owned hydroelectric plants, ordnance factories, gasoline and alcohol plants, and other war industries in western and eastern Sichuan Province. The largest of the private factories is the Chongqing Iron Company not far from Chongqing, and the Sichuan Sericulture Company, a joint venture between the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the provincial authorities, with a capital of 4 million yuan. Currently under construction is a sugar refinery of a similar nature, with a capital of 3 million yuan. The Sichuan-Xikang Wool Factory has an initial capital of 300,000 yuan, cotton mills that weave high-quality fabrics, and alcohol manufacturing plants that produce more alcohol and mixed gasoline. As for the prosperous industries of the border province of Yunnan, they are concentrated in</p>
<p>mining work</p>
<p>. The Yunnan Northern Mining Management Office, organized by the National Resources Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the provincial government, has already adopted new-style mining and refining methods to increase the production of copper in China's largest copper production center. At the same time, the Management Office is building a hydroelectric plant in the province. When completed in two years, it will supply electricity to the entire province of Yunnan. This large-scale program to electrify the entire province of Yunnan requires an expenditure of 6 million yuan. Yunnan Province is known for its tin and lead production. Only a few months ago, it was still mined using centuries-old methods. Now, scientific methods are also being used for mining. In the near future, overseas Chinese investors will invest 50 million yuan to establish a development company. The mining industry in this border province is expected to develop greatly. The leading figure in promoting the realization of this plan is China's</p>
<p>industrial magnate</p>
<p>from the Straits Settlements, Ou Benhua (transliteration). The Xinhua Chemical Products Factory (transliteration), organized by many industrialists from Shanghai and Guangzhou in Kunming, has already used local raw materials to manufacture large quantities of chemical products. The cotton mill established by the Yunnan Provincial Economic Commission at a cost of 1.25 million yuan is now selling its cheap and high-quality fabrics and cotton yarn in markets over a wide area. The government's efforts to develop another part of the Northwest Group will be applied to Guizhou Province, focusing on the development of the province's rich mineral resources. Guizhou Province accounts for three of China's four major mercury-producing areas, with the fourth in western Hunan. An investment of 400,000 yuan will now be used to increase</p>
<p>mercury production</p>
<p>, and another 200,000 yuan will be used to improve sales and transportation facilities. This industry will be organized by the provincial government with the economic and technical cooperation of the National Resources Commission. The Guizhou Mining Management Office will guide it. In March, according to a sleeve report issued by the Guizhou Provincial Government Investigation Department, eight ounces of gold were extracted from one ton of quartz used as a sample. This sounds impossible, but it must be remembered that the natives of the province often discover large amounts of gold using primitive placer mining methods. Until recently, no systematic method has been tried to determine important mineral veins. Xikang, China's new province, is also trending towards industrialization. Because of its</p>
<p>abundant gold production</p>
<p>, it has attracted many wealthy and enterprising industrialists in China to develop it. The Gold Mine Management Office organized by the government has already selected an area in eastern Xikang as an important center for mining this precious metal. Factories that use famous wool manufacturing items have already begun work. At the same time, the possibility of mining the abundant coal mines in this border province is also being studied. The Kaiyang Coal Mine Company (transliteration), managed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, may soon be able to use the privilege of using the machinery of the famous Xiangtan coal-producing area in Hunan Province. The Xiangtan coal-producing area is approaching the war zone and is not suitable for continued work.</p>

<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: From March 1st to 10th, Japanese warships harassed the coastal counties of Haicheng, Tong'an, Jinjiang, Hui'an, and Putian in southern Fujian. In addition to shelling Xiamen in Tong'an and Haicang in Haicheng, they also dispatched aircraft from the ships to bomb Xiutu and Luoyang in Hui'an, Xunpu and Xinmen in Jinjiang, Xiamen in Tong'an, and the urban area of Longxi County. However, due to the strict defense by the Chinese army, more than 20 civilians were killed or injured, and more than ten houses were destroyed. They also looted several civilian ships on the sea. The Japanese warships, realizing their failure, all nine ships, left on the morning of the 10th. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the same day, seven Japanese warships arrived outside the mouth of the Minjiang River in Fuzhou, anchoring in the waters of Baiquan Yang, Nangan Tang, Dongsha Island, and Meihua Port. In recent days, they have been harassing the coastal counties of Lianjiang, Changle, and Minhou in eastern Fujian. The details of the events are described below:</p>
<p>On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese warships first lowered several speedboats, patrolling various ports. They intercepted and burned a civilian ship in the waters of Xiaocheng in Lianjiang County. Then, they sent an aircraft to raid Changmen, dropping five bombs, all of which landed on barren mountains. On the morning of the 11th, they sent another aircraft to raid Guantou, dropping three bombs, destroying a boat and killing one person and injuring two others on the wharf. On the morning of the 12th, four of the Japanese warships anchored at the mouth of the Minjiang River left, leaving three anchored at Nangan Tang and Baiquan Yang. At 6:00 AM on the morning of the 13th, the Japanese warship anchored at Nangan Tang lowered two speedboats, intercepting two civilian ships on the sea. They immediately dispatched sailors to board the two ships, forcing the crew to drive the ships on their behalf. The two speedboats led the way, arriving at Dinghai in Lianjiang County. More than 20 Japanese soldiers sneaked ashore, set the house of the Lianbao director on fire, and fled back to the speedboats. On the way, they fired dozens of machine guns at the shore of Xiaocheng. At 6:00 AM on the morning of the 14th, a Japanese aircraft taking off from Xiamen dropped three bombs at Liuwudian in Tong'an County, all of which landed on barren land. At 10:30 AM on the morning of the 16th, the Japanese warship anchored at Nangan Tang lowered two speedboats, sailing to Xiaocheng in Lianjiang County, intercepting two civilian ships, setting the ships on fire, and killing all the crew members. At 7:00 AM on the morning of the 16th, four more Japanese warships arrived at the mouth of the Minjiang River, anchoring at Furen Island and Dongsha Island. At 3:00 PM, they lowered three speedboats, advancing towards Xiaocheng, and opening fire with machine guns on the shore. The Chinese defenders waited for them to approach before returning fire. Several Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded before they retreated. At 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 17th, the four Japanese warships anchored at Furen Island and Dongsha Island sailed away, leaving three anchored between Baiquan Yang and Nangan Tang. On the 18th, due to heavy rain and fog, there were no unusual movements. On the 19th, eight Japanese warships were discovered on the sea off Xiamen. Also, the Japanese artillery at the Gaoqi battery in Xiamen fired more than ten shells and hundreds of machine gun rounds at Jimei in Tong'an County, all of which landed on the beach. At 1:00 PM on the 20th, the Japanese troops at the Gaoqi battery in Xiamen fired five more shells at Aotou in Tong'an County. At 1:00 PM on the 21st, four Japanese aircraft dispatched by the Japanese warships at the mouth of the Minjiang River invaded Fuzhou, dropping two bombs at Taijiang, injuring two people and collapsing one house. They dropped five bombs at Dongmendou, injuring one person. They dropped three bombs at Jintai Road, collapsing one house. They dropped four bombs outside the Water Gate. At 6:00 AM on the 22nd, three Japanese warships anchored at the mouth of the Minjiang River sailed two ships to the sea off Hui'an in southern Fujian. At 9:30 AM, four aircraft took off from the warships and flew to Jinjiang, dropping twelve bombs outside the South Gate, landing near the Bank of China, the Telegraph Bureau, and the Salt Warehouse, collapsing fifteen houses, killing eight people, and injuring ten. They also turned back to Hui'an, opening fire with machine guns in the city, killing two people and injuring three. They then flew to Putian County, dropping four bombs at Sanjiangkou, collapsing one house and injuring one person. At 0:30 PM, the four Japanese aircraft finally flew back to the warships off Hui'an from Putian. One of them, due to engine trouble, landed on the sea off Putian. By evening, two speedboats dispatched by the Japanese warships off Hui'an towed it away. On the same day, a Japanese spy disguised as a beggar was captured at the wharf in Hanjiang Commercial Port (under the jurisdiction of Putian County). He could speak Japanese and Minnan dialect. He was immediately sent to the Putian County Government for interrogation. His origin is still under investigation. At 7:00 AM on the morning of the 23rd, two more Japanese warships arrived at the mouth of the Minjiang River, anchoring at Baiquan Yang. At 0:10 PM, three aircraft took off, reconnoitering the Changmen, Chuanshi, and Guantou areas at the mouth of the Minjiang River for more than 20 minutes before landing on the warships. Currently, there are three Japanese warships outside the mouth of the Minjiang River, two off the coast of Hui'an, and eight off the coast of Xiamen.</p>

<h3 id="e23">PROMOTING THE EXPORT OF DOMESTIC GOODS - SOUTHWESTERN CUSTOMS BECOME THE FOCUS - TAX ADMINISTRATION TRANSFERS A LARGE NUMBER OF CUSTOMS OFFICERS - POST-WAR EXPORTS INCREASE MORE THAN PRE-WAR <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>After the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance made every effort to promote the export of domestic goods, trade in the southwestern customs of Mengzi, Longzhou, and Tengyue improved. The Director-General of Customs has transferred a large number of customs officers to work. Exports of domestic goods have increased more after the war than before, concentrated in Hong Kong, and then transferred to various countries overseas. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>INTENTION TO PROMOTE THE EXPORT OF DOMESTIC GOODS</p>
<p>After making every effort to promote the export of domestic goods, the export of major domestic goods, such as tung oil, tea, animals and animal products, mineral sands, and textiles, has increased more than before the war, and has not decreased sharply due to transportation obstacles. For example, 57,580,900 yuan in 1935, 70,574,100 yuan in 1936, 83,825,600 yuan in 1937, and 76,264,100 yuan in 1938, which is enough to prove that the export of domestic goods after the war has increased more than before the war. The goods are ranked first in textiles, first in animals and animal products, and third in mineral sands and metal products.</p>
<p>EXPORTS FROM SOUTHWESTERN CUSTOMS INCREASE DRAMATICALLY</p>
<p>Major domestic goods have been managed by the Trade Commission, exported from the southwestern and Zhejiang-Fujian customs, concentrated in Hong Kong, and then transshipped to various countries. As a result, exports from the southwestern customs have increased dramatically. For example, Longzhou Customs was 37,000 yuan in August of last year and 2,128,000 yuan in February of this year, Mengzi Customs was 1,312,000 yuan in August of last year and 1,982,000 yuan in February of this year, Tengyue Customs was 171,000 yuan in August of last year and 600,600 yuan in February of this year, Simao Customs was 477 yuan in August of last year and 27,000 yuan in February of this year, and Shantou Customs was 3,421,000 yuan in August of last year and 4,460,000 yuan in February of this year.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that the center of gravity of China's export trade has shifted to the southwestern customs after the war, Director-General of Customs Mei Lehe has been informed by the tax officials of Longzhou, Mengzi, Tengyue, Simao, and other customs that, due to the sharp increase in export goods, the original customs officers are insufficient to be allocated, and they have requested that additional customs officers be sent to work at the various customs. Director-General Mei recently transferred customs officers to go, including several Chinese deputy tax officials. As for Ningbo and Wenzhou in Zhejiang, Quanzhou in Fujian, and Shantou in Guangdong, customs officers have recently been increased. Most of these customs officers have been evacuated from the customs in the occupied areas.</p>
<p>SPECIALLY APPROVED TAX-FREE EXPORT OF DOMESTIC GOODS</p>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from the Customs yesterday that, in order to promote the export of domestic goods and enrich the foundation of foreign exchange, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have decided that major domestic goods, such as tung oil, hog bristles, leather, fur goods, tea, mineral sands, gallnuts, medicinal herbs, wool, silk, ramie, casings, and feathers, shall be exported tax-free. Therefore, the tax-free export goods from the southwestern customs have increased dramatically. For example, in February of this year, Longzhou was 914,000 yuan, Mengzi was 110,000 yuan, Tengyue was 569,000 yuan, Shantou was 1,615,000 yuan, Wenzhou was 276,000 yuan, and Simao was 200,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Japanese Monopolization of Water and Land Cargo Transportation; Squeezing Out Foreign Business Interests; British, German, and Italian Merchant Ships Have Almost No Cargo to Load; Currently, They Are Jointly Planning Coping Measures <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese attempt to control shipping on the Yangtze River and inland waterways has been decisively realized through their special force. Nisshin Kisen Kaisha (Japan Mail Steamship Company) has dispatched ships to operate at various downstream ports, beginning to load cargo and passengers. Land transportation on the Beijing-Shanghai railway line has also reduced fees to solicit passengers and goods, resulting in various foreign ships being squeezed under the pressure of these Japanese and puppet vehicles. Furthermore, difficulties are created in issuing "Removal Permits," leading to sluggish cargo transportation, with each voyage reporting losses. The following details the situation:</p>
<p>Nisshin Merchant Ships Begin Operations</p>
<p>The Japanese, through active planning, have gradually realized their attempt to control shipping on the Yangtze River downstream (Jiangnan Line) from Shanghai to Jiangyin, and (Jiangbei Line) from Shanghai to Qinglong Port. At various ports along the river, such as Liuhe, Yanglin, Qiya, Baiyuan, Hupu, Changyinsha, Fushan, Niantuogang, and Zhanghuanggang, Nisshin Kisen Kaisha has added five merchant ships since the end of last month, beginning to carry passengers and load cargo. Because the company had previously coordinated with the Shanghai military authorities and the Japanese army and navy stationed in various locations along the river, "Removal Permits" for passengers and goods booked on Japanese ships can be issued at any time, without inspection or detention along the way. As for Qinglong Port on the Jiangbei Line, since the Japanese army stationed there, it has been hindering foreign ships in every possible way, causing foreign merchant ships to abandon cargo transportation to that port. Nisshin Kisen Kaisha has taken the opportunity to rise, initially with only one Japanese ship operating, but now it has increased the number of sailings.</p>
<p>Reducing Freight Rates to Compete for Business</p>
<p>In addition to seizing the shipping business of foreign merchants along the Yangtze River, the Japanese are also attempting to completely eliminate all the rights and interests of foreign shipping. Given that the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha ships are insufficient to meet the demand on various lines, they have drastically reduced freight rates for land transportation on the Beijing-Shanghai railway line, so that various goods from the interior will not be transported to the river to be loaded onto ships, but can instead be loaded onto trains. At the same time, various small inland ships have also been controlled by the Inland Waterways Shipping Company, newly established by Nisshin Kisen Kaisha. Under the special force of the Japanese, water and land transportation has been completely monopolized. The goal is to drive out foreign shipping in the future, and then arbitrarily raise freight rates, squeezing merchants and civilians.</p>
<p>Foreign Ships Suffer from Double Pressure and Losses</p>
<p>British, German, Italian, Portuguese, and other foreign merchant ships have suffered a sudden drop in business as a result of this double pressure. Moreover, the Japanese are creating difficulties in issuing Removal Permits for passengers and goods shipped on foreign ships. Since mid-last month, foreign ships operating along the Yangtze River have had almost no cargo to load on each voyage, resulting in significant losses. According to investigations by a reporter from the Modern News Agency, authorities from various foreign shipping companies have jointly held several meetings to discuss concrete measures to negotiate with the Japanese authorities. Among the foreign merchants, the two British companies, Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson, have suffered the most from Japanese pressure. Although the Japanese appear more accommodating to German and Italian merchants on the surface, the actual loss of rights and interests is no different. Therefore, foreign merchants, understanding the Japanese scheme and because their business interests are the same, are actively planning coping measures.</p>
<p>Jiaxing: The Urgency of War</p>
<p>Chaotic Situation and Suspended Sailings</p>
<p>A fierce guerrilla war has broken out in Jiaxing, with the guerrillas controlling all the major towns in the surrounding countryside and advancing to the outskirts of the city. They are currently adopting an encirclement strategy, and will begin the attack as soon as preparations are complete. The Japanese army in the city has erected cannons and machine guns on the city walls. A battle could erupt at any moment. A ship that recently departed from Shanghai to Jiaxing failed to arrive due to the chaotic situation there and has returned. The Shanghai-Jiaxing sailings have now been suspended.</p>
<p>Two Japanese Warships Invade Haimen, Apparently with Plans to Land</p>
<p>At the ports of Haimen and Qidong in northern Jiangsu, Japanese warships had previously harassed the area and attempted to land several times without success. According to recent news from the shipping industry, on the first of this month, Japanese troops from the Three Factories area once again attacked the Chinese positions, but were repelled by the brave resistance of the Chinese army. On the morning of the second, two Japanese warships sailed to the outside of Haimen Port, dispatching two small motorboats carrying dozens of Japanese soldiers to patrol the coast, apparently with plans to land. They also used machine guns to strafe the area. Local troops, who had already taken strict precautions, were prepared. Seeing that they were prepared, the Japanese left. The Jiangsu provincial authorities have ordered the troops stationed at the various ports of Haimen to step up their defenses and strike hard at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e26">The Customs Allows the Transshipment of Miscellaneous Grains and Their Products; However, Justification Must Be Provided and Prior Approval Obtained; All Approved Transshipments Are Fully Exempt from Duty <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance prohibited the export and transshipment of miscellaneous grains and their products to the occupied areas, special permission was granted for transshipment to non-occupied areas with full exemption from transshipment duties. Due to the special circumstances of the Shanghai Jianghai Customs, transshipment is now permitted, but prior approval must be requested. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Transshipment of Miscellaneous Grains is Exempt from Duty</p>
<p>According to the Customs Transshipment Duty Regulations of the Republic of China, Category 2, miscellaneous grains and their products: No. 45, bran; No. 46, buckwheat; No. 47, miscellaneous grain flour, A. wheat flour (including wheat bran), B. unnamed miscellaneous grain flour (including potato flour); No. 48, sorghum; No. 49, corn; No. 50, millet; No. 51, rice; No. 52, seed cakes (including broken cakes and powder), A. soybean cake, B. cottonseed cake, C. peanut cake, D. rapeseed cake, E. others; No. 53, wheat; No. 54, unnamed miscellaneous grains. The Ministry of Finance has now ordered a complete prohibition on their export and transshipment to occupied areas, and special permission has been granted for full tax exemption on transshipment to non-occupied areas.</p>
<p>Shanghai Customs Must Approve in Advance</p>
<p>According to news from Jianghai Customs, Jianghai Customs had previously received orders from the Ministry of Finance to completely prohibit the export of miscellaneous grains and their products. The issue of transshipment has now been approved. However, because the Shanghai Jianghai Customs is in a special situation, and its area is already an occupied area, anyone wishing to transship, whether to occupied or non-occupied areas, must state the reason for the transshipment and provide all supporting documents. Prior approval must be obtained from the Jianghai Customs before customs clearance for transshipment is permitted, and in accordance with the orders of the Ministry of Finance, full tax exemption on transshipment will be granted. It is reported that some relief rice for refugees, with proof from the concession authorities, has been approved for loading and transshipment.</p>

<h3 id="e27">The Japanese Are Planning to Build a Giant Fortress in Wusong; Japanese Attempt to Cross the Yanglinkou Again Fails; A Company of Puppet Troops in Xinlonghua Defects <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese "Central China General Headquarters" is building a giant fortress on the original site of the Wusong Fort, along with a radio station. A large amount of cement, steel, and stones have been transported there recently, and construction has already begun. It is expected that the project will be completed in October, at a cost of over three million. According to the Japanese, after the completion of this giant fortress, it will be more than sufficient to control the doors of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Attempt to Cross the Yanglinkou Fails</p>
<p>More than a hundred Japanese soldiers, traveling in over ten small motorboats, have repeatedly attempted to cross the Yanglinkou, but have been repelled by the guerrillas, so they have not yet succeeded. Still unwilling to give up, they erected a pontoon bridge the night before last (the 1st), attempting to invade. This was discovered by the guerrilla sentries, who ambushed them in the fields, launching a head-on attack as the Japanese landed. They also used intense machine gun fire, causing heavy casualties to the unprepared Japanese army. The surviving enemy could not withstand the attack and fled in disarray, leaving behind many weapons. The Yanglinkou is still guarded by the guerrillas.</p>
<p>Puppet Troops in the Southern District Defect</p>
<p>A company of over 150 men from the puppet "Pacification Army" in Xinlonghua in the southern district, unable to withstand the oppression of the Japanese army, defected the night before last (the 2nd), carrying all their weapons. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese garrison quickly dispatched troops to pursue them. A fierce battle ensued, resulting in the Japanese army being defeated and retreating. The company then fled westward, reportedly joining the guerrillas in preparation for wiping out the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Dense Gunfire in the Suburbs of Shanghai</p>
<p>Extreme Tension in Beixinjing Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Many Rumors in the Southern District</p>
<p>Around 4:00 AM on the third, dense gunfire suddenly erupted in the Beixinjing area, accompanied by the sound of small mortars. Residents were awakened from their sleep, and rumors spread that guerrillas had infiltrated and were engaging in combat. Around 6:00 AM, a large number of Japanese troops were dispatched to search homes and pedestrians. A small steamship with dozens of armed Japanese soldiers patrolled the river surface in the area, inspecting boats. As a result, a large number of boats docked in the Beixinjing area on the morning of the third crowded into the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<p>Around 11:00 PM on the evening of the second, clear gunfire was suddenly heard in the southern district, seemingly coming from the Xinlonghua area, leading to many rumors in the area. The Japanese army has strengthened its defenses in the southern district. At the junction of western Shanghai and the southern district, the Japanese army has ordered residents to rearrange the barbed wire fences. Inspections at the docks have also become very strict.</p>

<h3 id="e29">Rumors of Illegal Actions by the Puppet Regime; Special Court Under Strict Guard; Large Numbers of Detectives and Garrison Troops Dispatched; Close Protection of the Court Creates a Tense Situation <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The agreement between the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Consular Corps regarding the court in the concessions began its fourth period on April 1st of this year. According to the contents of the agreement, if neither party gives notice of termination or modification within six months, the agreement can be extended for three years and remain in effect. Therefore, all administrative organizations of the two courts in the Special District remain as before, with no changes. The Special District First Court has been under tight security for days due to rumors of illegal actions by the puppet organization. Yesterday, new rumors suddenly arose, stating that a large number of puppet officials, protected by armed Japanese troops, would be dispatched by the puppet "Municipal Government" to the Special District First Court to take it over. To prevent this from happening, the concession authorities dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives yesterday, along with Scottish troops stationed at the court, to implement emergency precautions and provide protection. In addition to armed police patrolling the area, the iron gates were tightly closed, with only a small door left open for entry and exit. Public officials or parties involved in civil and criminal lawsuits were required to present proof of identity when entering the court. Those with spectator tickets and unrelated individuals were subjected to strict questioning. Armed detectives were also stationed in each civil and criminal court to provide close protection. Therefore, the situation at the court was extremely tense yesterday. However, no unexpected incidents occurred until evening. It is understood that these emergency precautions will continue today and are not expected to be lifted for the time being.</p>
<p>Serious Disaster in Xuyi, Anhui Province</p>
<p>Difficult to Plant Second Crop of Wheat; No Harvest at Noon</p>
<p>No Food or Fuel; People Are About to Starve to Death</p>
<p>The China Foreign Famine Relief Committee at 97 Renji Road in this city received a report yesterday from local public organizations and representatives of disaster victims in Xuyi County, Anhui Province, stating that the disaster in the county is severe, with lives in imminent danger, urgently requiring relief. The report is recorded as follows: Xuyi, Anhui Province, is located in the lower reaches of the Wei River, bordering Hongze Lake. In recent years, droughts and floods have been frequent, and the people have been displaced and their vitality exhausted. Fortunately, the National Government, the Committee, and major philanthropists have allocated funds to provide relief, saving tens of thousands of people. Their kindness and benevolence are still remembered and praised today. Last summer, continuous rain caused a disaster. The Huai River rose sharply, the Yellow River breached its dikes, and the river was blocked, with no way to discharge the water. The water flowed horizontally and back, causing fields and homes to be submerged and family property to be destroyed. Countless people and livestock were swept away by the waves. In addition, the wind howled and the waves surged, causing significant losses to people's lives and property. Since autumn, the water level has not decreased. Although the water level decreased slightly in winter, it rose and fell erratically, and the second crop of wheat has not yet been planted. There is no hope for a harvest at noon this year. Since the beginning of spring this year, there has been continuous overcast and rainy weather. The 50,000 households in Xuyi have no food or fuel and are about to starve to death. All the cattle have been slaughtered and sold, and there is no way to obtain money. No one can afford to lend grain. If relief is not requested, the remaining people will be in a desperate situation. In addition to requesting relief from the National Government, we also hope that philanthropists in Shanghai will allocate relief funds to save the lives of tens of thousands of people.</p>
<p>Slight Increase in Retail Rice Prices; Reason</p>
<p>After the Rice Merchants Association in this city decided to add a commission and miscellaneous transportation fees of 40 cents per picul for retail sales, effective April 1st, it caused misunderstandings from the outside. Yesterday, a reporter from the Modern News Agency specially visited Zhang Nianxuan, a leader in the rice industry, to inquire about the details. According to his reply, since the end of February this year, rice prices in Shanghai have gradually risen. At that time, it was still the middle of the first month of the lunar calendar. Since each store had some inventory at the end of the year, the high rice prices were either due to the scarcity of the source due to rainy weather, or a temporary shortage. Once the weather cleared and the supply surged, prices would return to normal. Therefore, they strongly urged their colleagues to endure the pain and sacrifice to maintain the price limit. However, the goods purchased by each store last year have now been sold out, and the market price of newly purchased goods has reached the price limit, and the arrival of goods is still scarce every day, and the rising price trend is prolonged and there is no sign of a decline. How can we continue to bear the losses for a long time? Therefore, in order to maintain our own business, we have added a commission and miscellaneous transportation fees of 40 cents per picul, which is a last resort.</p>
<p>Change of豆米 (Bean and Rice) Market Admission Certificates; Summer Certificates to Be Issued</p>
<p>Market guarantee and penalty measures have been implemented. The Shanghai Bean and Rice Market Management Committee issued Public Announcement No. 65 yesterday to exchange admission certificates. According to the notice, the Brokers' Business Scope and Guarantee and Penalty Measures, agreed upon by the Bean and Rice Trade Association, will be implemented from April 1st. This has already been announced in the market. Now, the Spring Admission Certificates will expire on the 15th of this month, and the Summer Admission Certificates will be exchanged on a scheduled basis. All those who have obtained a Broker's Certificate must immediately obtain an application form from the Northern Office, affix the official seal of a guaranteed firm, and pay a deposit of 20 yuan in legal tender for registration and certificate filling. Otherwise, the old certificate will be canceled and cannot be exchanged. This announcement is made to avoid any misunderstanding.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Japanese and Puppet Regimes Compile North China Exchange; Still Trying to Conceal It; Pretentiously Claiming "Chinese Customs Autonomy" <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>According to the French-language "Peking News," the spokesman of the "Provisional Government" here recently made a statement to reporters at a press briefing, saying that some days ago, news came from the Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France had successively lodged representations with the Japanese government regarding the control of foreign exchange in North China. According to the spokesman's statement, this control of foreign exchange was the natural result of the autonomy of the "Chinese Customs" and was deliberately "distorted" by the imperialists of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, who raised "unconscious" protests. According to the spokesman, the exchange control measures implemented in North China treat Chinese and foreigners equally, and Japanese and "Manchukuo" people are also treated in the same way. Therefore, foreign nationals do not need to protest this and increase resentment. It was reported at the time that a foreign reporter asked whether the Japanese and "Manchukuo" people, even if they were treated equally, the Japanese and puppet sides could not use this as an excuse to compile measures that hinder foreign trade, since the principle of the Open Door was previously agreed upon by various countries and the Manchu Qing government. The spokesman appeared quite embarrassed by this question. He then said that this exchange control measure was really an economic need in North China, and that the Chinese National Government also had foreign exchange control, so why did other countries not protest against it?</p>

<p>Special Approval for Four Ships to Sail to Dinghai</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday that the Shanghai-Ningbo sailing schedule scheduled by the Ningbo Shipping Association has been implemented since April 1st. As for the "Hana" of the German Far East Company, it has been approved to sail the Ningbo-Dinghai-Shanghai route, but it is absolutely not allowed to carry passengers when sailing from Ningbo to Dinghai and from Dinghai to Shanghai.

<p>"Hana" Encountered Wind En Route to Shanghai</p>
<p>The "Hana" of the German Far East Company loaded passengers and cargo in Ningbo at 7:00 AM the day before yesterday and sailed straight back to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 PM that night, when sailing to the Tongsha waters outside the Wusong Estuary, it suddenly encountered a strong wind and surging waves. Several deck boards of the ship's No. 4 hold were blown away by the strong wind, and the electrical wires of the ship's radio station were also broken by the wind. The German captain of the ship was extremely alert and immediately stopped anchoring to avoid danger and sent out a distress signal. Fortunately, the wind subsided slightly, and the ship safely arrived in port yesterday morning after anchoring for a night.</p>
<p>"De Ping" Was Not Fired Upon by Japanese Warships</p>
<p>Yesterday's report stated that the "De Ping" of the Italian Sino-Italian Company sailed from Ningbo to Shanghai on the 31st of last month. At 9:00 PM that night, when passing through the Yushan waters, it was suddenly fired upon five or six times by Japanese warships stationed at Yushan due to heavy fog and poor visibility, causing the passengers to be frightened. A reporter from the Modern News Agency inquired with the company yesterday, and they stated that the news was completely untrue. The ship did not hear the Japanese warships firing at all during its voyage from Ningbo to Shanghai. The ship's crew also stated that there was no such incident.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Japanese Consulate Police Authorities Not Moving into Post Office Parcel Department; The Parcel Department of the Post Office on Yuhang Road in Hongkou is a Separate Rented Space Unrelated to the Post Office <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Reports state that the Japanese Consulate Police Authorities have moved into the Post Office parcel department to conduct business. This news has attracted much attention. A reporter from the Datong News Agency specially investigated and recorded the truth of the matter as follows:</p>
<p>The History of the Parcel Department in Hongkou</p>
<p>According to investigations by a Datong News Agency reporter, the Shanghai Postal Administration currently has two parcel departments: one is the General Post Office parcel department at the Sichuan Road bridgehead, and the other is the parcel department of the Hongkou East Yuhang Road Post Office Branch. It is understood that the Yuhang Road Branch parcel department was newly established after the Shanghai war, entirely for the convenience of residents in the Hongkou area for delivering and receiving parcels. Its name is the Yuhang Road Branch Parcel Business Office.</p>
<p>The Truth About the Japanese Police Station Moving In</p>
<p>The parcel business office was previously located within the Yuhang Road Post Office. Later, due to insufficient space, it rented the ground floor of the Public Works Department's primary school at 170 Peng Road for office use. A few days ago, the Japanese Consulate Police Authorities also rented the entire first, second, and third floors of the same primary school from the Public Works Department for office use. However, it is completely unrelated to the ground floor Post Office parcel department. It is incomprehensible why the Japanese side is deliberately misrepresenting the situation.</p>
<p>Seven Post Offices Reopened in Guerrilla Areas</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Datong News Agency investigations, the Shanghai Postal District has recently reopened seven post offices, including: 1. Jinshan Second Class Post Office (reopened February 27); 2. Zhujiajiao Second Class Post Office (reopened March 20); 3. Qingpu Second Class Post Office (reopened March 25); 4. Luodian Third Class Post Office (reopened March 21); 5. Qibao Agency (reopened March 6); 6. Meilong Agency (reopened March 16); 7. Shaolou Agency (reopened March 6).</p>
<h3 id="e34">Japanese Warships and Pirates Disturbing Dinghai, Eastern Zhejiang; Gaoting Town Suffers Losses of One Million Yuan; Liheng Island Pillaged, Villagers Flee <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Gaoting Town and Liheng Island in Dinghai County, Eastern Zhejiang, have recently been repeatedly disturbed by Japanese warships and pirates, resulting in significant losses. The county government has ordered the strengthening of self-defense organization and training. The following are the detailed reports from the Modern News Agency's Dinghai correspondent:</p>
<p>Significant Losses in Gaoting Town</p>
<p>Gaoting Town, under the jurisdiction of Dinghai County, is located on the eastern frontier of Daishan, situated by the sea. Markets and residences are densely packed, and commerce is prosperous. Recently, for the past ten months, it has been repeatedly subjected to landings by pirates and shelling by enemy ships, with total losses reaching one million yuan. As a result, various sectors have experienced unemployment and displacement, and local autonomy and self-defense have been unable to proceed. The town mayor, Huang Jun, and local gentry and merchants, in order to stabilize the people's hearts and restore the town's appearance, specially telegraphed the county government the other day, earnestly requesting prompt rescue measures or sound policies to ensure the people's livelihood. Upon receiving the report, the county government, in addition to requesting the Offshore Maritime Police to suppress the pirates and defend the area, has also ordered the intensification of self-defense training to enhance self-defense capabilities.</p>
<p>Pirates Disturb Liheng Island</p>
<p>Liheng Island in Dinghai is remotely located in a corner of the sea, far from the city, and its local self-defense forces are extremely weak. In recent years, it has often been subjected to pirate landings and pillaging. On the 26th of last month, more than one hundred pirates suddenly arrived on the island, occupying the Taiping Temple area, forcibly seizing firearms from the self-defense team, and looting everywhere. The families of villagers Wang Gongzhu, Wang Huichang, Yu Baoren, Zhang Chenzhong, Wang Mengjiu, Wang Jinshan, Wang Menglai, and others were all looted, and they colluded with Taiwanese bandits to kidnap twelve children of Yang Jinhao's family in the Dasha Tou area, ten miles away, coercing local gentry and Baojia leaders to forcibly collect 16,000 national currency, and threatening to burn the entire village if all self-defense firearms were not handed over within a week. Currently, villagers have fled, with nine out of ten houses empty.</p>

Now, due to retirement, he has resigned. While accepting his resignation, the bureau expressed deep regret.</p>

<h3 id="e35">The Dingshun Pawnshop in Nanhui Was Robbed; The Owner Sues for Compensation; Court Arguments Conclude, Judgment Scheduled <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The Dingshun Pawnshop outside Nanhui County, after the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, initially intended to relocate due to its importance to the economy of ordinary people, but was prevented by military and political authorities. After the National Army moved westward, it was again prevented from relocating by guerrillas, and continued to open as usual to maintain the market. On January 20th, 22nd, and 23rd of last year, it was robbed three times in a row. Afterwards, it reported to the local county government and moved the remaining pawned items to Shanghai. It is now advertising the redemption of these items at 105 Xiaodongmen Street, French Concession. Guan Jiangshi, a resident of Nanhui living in Room 114 of the Tong'an Building on Sanma Road, age 25, represented by lawyer Zhu Yakui, has filed a lawsuit with the Second Special Court Criminal Division, accusing Chen Xiquan, the manager of the Nanhui Dingshun Pawnshop, of embezzling items pawned by others in the course of his business, requesting investigation, and adding a civil suit.</p>
<p>Seeking Return of Pawned Items</p>
<p>The lawsuit states that on January 3, 1938, the plaintiff, needing funds, pawned four items, including a gold riding heart needle, gold ring, gold band, and gold hair press, weighing a total of 1.6 taels, to the defendant Dingshun Pawnshop for 75 yuan, holding pawn ticket No. 52. On February 23 of this year, the plaintiff prepared the principal and interest to redeem the items. The defendant claimed that the items had been stolen and refused redemption. The defendant's pawn ticket stated that the pawn was valid for 18 months, and that damage from insects, rats, or mold would be subject to fate. The defendant only claiming theft is not credible. The plaintiff requests investigation and return of the original items. Upon receiving the lawsuit, the court, represented by Judge Liao Yuan, summoned the defendant Chen Xiquan to the Second Criminal Court yesterday afternoon. The defendant Chen Xiquan, due to illness, sent lawyer Xue Jiaqi to defend him. The plaintiff and her representative lawyer appeared in court. After stating the previous circumstances, the defendant's lawyer argued that the defendant's Dingshun Pawnshop, located outside Nanhui City, was robbed three times in January of last year.</p>
<p>Robbed Three Times</p>
<p>Afterwards, the pawnshop reported to the county government and requested the Pawn Industry Association to send three people to jointly inspect the stolen pawned items, totaling 240 items, and prepare a detailed list for reporting. At the same time, the remaining items were moved to Shanghai and advertised for redemption, with a copy of the detailed list and newspaper presented for review. The plaintiff's pawned items were among those stolen. According to the Jiangsu Pawn Industry Improvement Plan implemented on January 1, 1935, Article 19 of the Provincial Government Council's announcement states that no compensation will be given for pawned goods damaged by war, floods, or fires. Moreover, the defendant's pawnshop is located in Nanhui. According to the agreement, the plaintiff's lawsuit in your court is also inconsistent with jurisdiction and should be rejected by the court after careful consideration. The court, after reviewing the statements, announced the conclusion and scheduled the judgment for 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 7th.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Entrusted to Collect Disaster Relief Funds; Embezzlement Leads to Arrest; Seven Checks Cashed; Two Thousand Embezzled from the Middle <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Xu Zichang, a native of Wuxi residing at No. 10, Pi Zi Lane, Taide Li, Xinzha Road, is engaged in the silkworm cocoon business. Several years ago, Zhu Boqin, of a certain silk factory, purchased silkworm cocoons from Xu and paid with seven checks totaling 9,333.5 taels of silver. However, when the checks</p>
<p>Failed to Clear</p>
<p>Xu negotiated with Zhu, but to no avail. Later, Zhu Boqin died of illness, and the matter was indefinitely delayed. Recently, Xu Zichang learned that Zhu Boqin's son, Zhu Mengqiao, had opened the Zhonghua Automobile Materials Company on Jing'an Temple Road, and the business was thriving. Xu wanted to recover the old debt, so he entrusted Hua Yunqing (age 52), a fellow villager residing at No. 25, Lane 253, Parker Road,</p>
<p>To Recover the Debt on His Behalf</p>
<p>At that time, Xu and Hua agreed that the minimum amount to be handled should be 3,000 yuan. Xu then gave Hua the seven checks, and Hua issued a receipt. Hua then negotiated with Zhu. By the 7th of last month, Hua went to Xu's house and said that the matter had been resolved, but the other party only agreed to pay 1,200 yuan. Xu did not object at the time, but was suspicious. After receiving the money, he gave Hua 400 yuan as a reward.</p>
<p>As a Reward</p>
<p>On the 25th, Xu sent a letter to Zhu to inquire. According to Zhu's reply, 3,200 yuan had been paid, and Xu realized that Hua had embezzled 2,000 yuan. Xu then hired lawyer Wan Weijian and reported to the Xinzha Police Station yesterday. Detective Chen Dabao and Western Detective Hua Sheng were dispatched to arrest Hua Yunqing and bring him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, Hua was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case, saying that the defendant had</p>
<p>Admitted to Embezzling</p>
<p>2,000 yuan in the police station. Except for 1,000 yuan that had been spent, the remaining 1,000 yuan had been given to Miss Lu, a compradore at the Dalu Foreign Firm, Room 401, Guohua Bank Building, Beijing Road. The police station learned that the defendant had reached a settlement with the plaintiff regarding the civil lawsuit, but the police station would still prosecute the criminal part according to Article 336 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, the defendant's statement was evasive, saying that a certain Mr. Yu Yang was involved in the matter. The judge ordered Hua to be detained and scheduled another hearing for the 14th of this month.</p>

<p>Li Chusan, a native of Guangdong, has been deceased for many years. He had a considerable fortune during his lifetime, which was originally kept by his stepmother, Zhao. His family used to live in a self-built house on Jiangwan Power Plant Road. After August 13th, Jiangwan was in the war zone, so the family led their children to Shanghai to escape the chaos, renting a house at 1060 Avenue Edward VII. As the war situation shifted, their house was</p>
<p>Destroyed by Shellfire, Causing Great Losses. Unexpectedly, last month, it was discovered that all the property stored in the residence, including deposit books from the Shanghai Bank worth over 28,000 yuan, an insurance policy from the Tianyi Insurance Company for the Jiangwan property, 650 shares of the Public Omnibus Company, and various ornaments, had been stolen by their daughter, Li Zhiming, who colluded with Yao Keming, the adoptive grandfather of her young son, Li Songjiang.</p>
<p>Stolen, Sold, or Fraudulently Claimed. The old woman, accompanied by her young son, Songjiang, reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest her daughter, Li Zhiming, and bring her to the First Special District Local Court for questioning. The details were reported previously. However, the suspect Yao Keming has been hiding in the Hongkou area, making it impossible to arrest him. It is said that a separate</p>
<p>Warrant has been Issued. Yesterday morning, the police again escorted Li to the court. Judge Meng briefly questioned her, and, as the case had been thoroughly investigated, he immediately announced the verdict, sentencing Li Zhiming to one year and two months of imprisonment. The defendant's mother and brother also hired lawyers, originally planning to file an incidental civil lawsuit against her daughter to recover all the embezzled property, worth over 55,300 yuan. However, the defendant repeatedly</p>
<p>Confessed in Court that she had given all the property to Yao Keming, and she had not received any share of it. The plaintiffs, mother and son, were also aware that the defendant was penniless and that pursuing a lawsuit would be of no practical benefit. Therefore, they postponed the incidental civil lawsuit and will request it to be filed and prosecuted when Yao is arrested in the future.</p>
<p>Fire on Wuding Road Claims the Life of a Child</p>
<p>A fire broke out in a household surnamed So-and-so at No. 72, Lane 31, Wuding Road, McTaggart Road, in western Shanghai at around 10:35 AM yesterday. The fire quickly spread to the neighboring houses at Nos. 74, 76, and 78. Although the Fire Brigade dispatched vehicles to the scene to rescue, the wind aided the fire, and it was not extinguished until noon. A five-year-old child living in the same house was unable to escape and perished in the fire, his head and face charred, in extreme misery. A man named Wu Jiantang (age 42) was burned on his head and arms, and an old woman named Hu Sunshi (age 63) broke her left leg, in serious condition. They were taken to Renji Hospital by ambulance for treatment. The fire destroyed Nos. 72 and 74, which were completely reduced to ashes. The other Nos. 76 and 78 were also partially burned, resulting in significant losses. The police are investigating the cause of the fire.</p>
<p>A Degenerate of the Intellectual Class; Fraud and Embezzlement; The Appeal Maintains the Original Principle</p>
<p>Xie Xiangsheng, a native of Changshu, once served as a primary school teacher. After the outbreak of the war, feeling unemployed and bored, he established a disguised fraudulent organization called the Personnel Trust Office at 233 Yuanmingyuan Road last year, publishing flamboyant advertisements. Someone soon informed the police station, and after investigation, the police initially did not explicitly ban it. However, in February, Xie embezzled all of the more than 500 yuan in guarantee money deposited by the five employees he hired, Shao Zihong, Yu Fengxiang, Chen Wen, Jin Zhiying, and Cao Huizhong. After Shao and others reported him, the police station dispatched detectives to arrest him and bring him to the First Special District Local Court, where he was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Xie was dissatisfied with the sentence and filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu opened a collegial panel and ordered the defendant to be brought to court to question the reasons for his dissatisfaction. Xie's statements were all empty words and cunning defenses. Therefore, police lawyer Gan Jingxian requested that the appeal be rejected. As a result, Xie was still detained to await the verdict.</p>

Also, on the night of the 19th of the same month, they opened fire during a robbery at No. 32, Lane 1170, Edinburgh Road, killing the victims Zhang Chuyuan and Zhang Wenda. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi sued them for robbery and murder in the First Special Court, and the trial has concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened the First Criminal Court and announced the main text of the judgment: Shan Zhongzhi is guilty of robbery and intentional homicide, sentenced to death, and deprived of political rights for life. He is also guilty of robbery with three or more people carrying weapons, sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, and deprived of political rights for seven years. The death sentence will be executed, and political rights will be deprived for life.

The hand gun and six bullets are confiscated.</p>
<p>Disaster Relief Worker Dies by Suicide</p>
<p>Gao Jixun, a native of Shandong, age 35, was the assistant bookkeeper at the Hengsheng Yi Summer Cloth Shop, a Shandong-based shop located at No. 22, Changgeng Li, east of Jiangxi Road intersection on Avenue Edward VII in the British Concession. Due to the embezzlement of funds that could not be made up, he committed suicide. On the afternoon of the 1st of this month, he went alone to the Da Hu Hotel in the Dongxin Bridge area of Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, using the alias Wang Jihua, claiming to rent Room 216 on the second floor for lodging. That night, he took poison and committed suicide. At 11:00 AM the next day, the tea servant Yuan Zilin (age 26, native of Changzhou) discovered him and notified the shop, which reported to the French police. Detectives rushed to the scene to investigate. No suicide note was found, only a wallet and business cards. He was immediately sent to Renji Hospital, but due to the severe poisoning, the rescue was ineffective, and he died at 4:00 PM. The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Autopsy Center. Detectives checked the address on the business cards, and the deceased's colleague and manager, Ren Yanfu, arrived at the center to identify the body and sign for it.</p>

<p>At around 11:00 PM the night before last, five Japanese men in suits suddenly arrived at a dance hall on Avenue Foch. They were accompanied by five dancers from the dance hall, Zhang Meiling, Zhu Lili, Peng Meiqi, and Zhang Meizhen. The Japanese men then ordered various refreshments and drank eight bottles of beer. They lingered until around 1:00 AM yesterday before getting up to leave. The waiter presented them with the bill, totaling 30 yuan and five cents, as well as a considerable amount for the dancers' fees. Unexpectedly, these five Japanese men refused to pay, and after a long negotiation, only agreed to pay 13 yuan and three cents. Because of the large difference, a dispute arose, and these five Japanese men</p>
<p>Strutted Downstairs, Ignoring the Matter. They also pulled out a pistol to demonstrate. The dance hall urgently telegraphed the police station to report. After the five Japanese men went downstairs, they fired several shots at the entrance. At that time, passersby did not know the truth and shouted "Robbery!" The manager of the Russian-language Chila newspaper across from the dance hall, hearing the news, also suspected it was a robbery and rushed out the door. He fired three shots into the air with his own pistol to demonstrate. The Japanese men quickly jumped into the No. 7882 car that had been arranged at the entrance and sped away. The No. 85 policeman on duty at the intersection of Avenue Mollière and Avenue Foch heard the alarm and immediately rushed over. Because the car had already left, he quickly jumped into the No. 12148 business car of Tailai Company on the side of the road and instructed the driver to chase quickly. A refugee from Austria also</p>
<p>Saw Injustice and Joined the Chase, Blaring the siren all the way. As a result, when the Japanese men's car passed the Rue de la Sainte Vierge in the French Concession, the No. 95 Chinese police officer there suspected a kidnapping and opened fire, ordering them to stop. Unexpectedly, the Japanese men's car sped eastward and disappeared. Afterwards, the dance hall authorities reported to the police station. The English-language North-China Daily News said that today (the 3rd) at dawn, a group of Koreans or Japanese, driving a car, were chased by a rented car, fleeing along Avenue Foch and Avenue Edward VII. There were also</p>
<p>Several Gunshots and Shouts of "Robbery". The incident arose from failure to pay a bill in a tavern. Police in the Public Concession and the French Concession are investigating this matter this morning and have requested the assistance of the police authorities of the Japanese Consulate. The clue obtained by the police is the number of the car, which is registered to a Korean. The incident started before midnight when five Koreans or Japanese, or both, went to a cafe on Avenue Foch to dance several times, drinking a lot of alcohol. At about 1:00 AM, the five decided to leave the store, and the waiter handed over the bill. They not only refused to pay the bill, but also</p>
<p>Assaulted the Waiter. Then they rushed to the door. The Chinese security guard tried to stop them without success. The five also tried to seize the security guard's pistol. They then got into their car and drove eastward wildly. The customers and staff in the tavern shouted "Robbery!" Mr. Qi Liejin, the general manager and editor of the Russian newspaper living nearby, heard the shouts and fired two shots from the balcony of his residence to attract the attention of the police. A Chinese police officer heard the shouts and rushed to a rental car of Tailai Company parked near the tavern. With the help of a foreigner, believed to be an Austrian refugee, the Chinese police officer requisitioned the</p>
<p>Car to Give Chase. It is said that the five men fired shots while fleeing to try to prevent the Chinese police officer from chasing them. A Chinese police officer of the French Concession at the corner of Avenue Messimy also fired two shots, one of which hit the rental car chasing behind, but the people in the car were not injured. Although the Koreans or Japanese were chased, they still managed to escape. Minutes later, detectives from both concessions began investigating.</p>

<p>Two major centers for the sale of narcotics run by morphine king Zhou A'gou and Ming Fuyuan, located in the Yihong Hospital Yao Er Tang Zi Lane on New Bridge Street in the French Concession and in the New Bridge area, have been ordered to be investigated by the French police authorities. However, such cunning rabbits' dens are not easy to break. However, the French police, including Chinese and Western detectives, recently busted members of their gang. One was in the attic of the second floor of No. 14, Dexing Li, West New Bridge Street, at the home of a woman named Cao A'lin (age 30, native of Pudong), where 11 small packages of morphine were seized. Cao and her accomplice, Chen Jinrong (age 29, native of Shaoxing), were arrested and taken back to the police station. Another arrest was made on Zilaihuo Street, where Zhou Wenyu was found to be carrying five packages of morphine. He was taken back to the police station and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District yesterday, requesting detention for investigation and arrest of the fugitive masterminds. After questioning by Judge Zhang Minsheng, the judge ordered a retrial on the 7th and ordered the defendants to be detained.</p>

<p>Packages to Kunming and other places have not yet resumed delivery</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration previously stipulated that all mail sent from Shanghai to the southwest or forwarded to the northwest provinces and cities such as Sichuan, Shaanxi, Xi'an, Gansu, Hubei, Yichang, Hunan, etc., should be forwarded via Wenzhou and Ningbo in Zhejiang, and transported by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which was quite smooth. However, due to Nanchang falling into the war zone, traffic on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Xiang-Gui Railways has been obstructed. Although the authorities have opened up alternative roads to maintain the original state, the transportation of mail is still difficult. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired with the Transportation Section of the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday and learned that all mail and packages, large and small, for the southwestern provinces and cities will be sent to Hong Kong by ship, or forwarded by Haiphong.

<h3 id="e46">Japanese Soldiers Stab Laborer <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Hongsheng from Sizhou, 28 years old, residing at 242 Park Road, used to be a painter but is now unemployed and destitute. Every morning at 7 o'clock, he waits at the Chapoo Road Bridge, sometimes when the Japanese in Hongkou need many laborers, they instruct a foreman (from Jiangbei), Mr. A, to call over several people to cross the bridge to work. They are escorted back across the bridge at dusk around 6 or 7 pm, and then they go home. Zhao can only temporarily make a living in this situation. Yesterday morning around 7 o'clock, Zhao went there as usual. Soon, a Japanese person raised his right hand (meaning he only needed five people). However, there were too many unemployed people south of the bridge, about a hundred or so, crowding forward. He was stabbed by the Japanese sentry stationed north of the bridge with a bayonet. Zhao was the first to be hit, stabbed once, and his right arm was pierced, bleeding profusely. He quickly returned across the bridge, and the Central Police Station at No. 1110 called for an ambulance to take him to Tung Jen Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Chen Jilin, who works at the German Merchant Shipping Company and resides at No. 75, Xiangcheng Lane, No. 93 Rue Bai Eer in the French Concession, was suddenly invaded by five robbers at 7 pm on the 29th of last month. The robbers, armed with two pistols, stole two diamond rings and over 200 yuan in cash. The robbers escaped with the loot. The victim chased after them and caught one of the robbers, Pan Jinhua (29 years old, local). He was taken to the police station, where he confessed that his accomplices were hiding in the New World Hotel at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Jing'an Temple Road. The police went to the New World Hotel and arrested Wang Jingen (27 years old) from Pudong. He was taken back to the police station and was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday. Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer for the French Concession administration, requested a postponement of the investigation and prosecution, and to arrest the remaining accomplices. The victim also described the robbery and the process of catching the first defendant. Pan confessed that he and the fugitives Pan Liangwen and others had come to Shanghai from Pudong with a Mauser pistol to commit robbery, and now they have returned to Pudong. Wang denied being at the scene. Judge Zhang Minsheng ordered a postponement for further questioning on the 12th and ordered the defendants to be detained.</p>

<p>Five Fortune Tickets Set for Drawing on the 10th, and United Benefit Tickets Continue to be Issued</p>
<p>Previously, Wu Zhou Pharmacy, in order to increase the interest of customers purchasing "Artificial Self-Made Blood" and "Wu Zhou Two Types of Cod Liver Oil" and other products, issued Five Fortune Prize Tickets, giving everyone the hope of winning huge bonuses.

They had no choice but to increase the number of tickets by 5,000, but those who came later still flocked in. The pharmacy intends to increase the number of tickets again, but fears that too many tickets will make it more difficult to win, which may disappoint participants. It is now heard that the pharmacy has decided to continue issuing the second series of United Benefit Tickets, with increased bonuses and more prizes, making it easier to win. Ticket exchange will begin on the 15th. It is hoped that those who missed out on the first series and those who love Wu Zhou health products will quickly go to exchange tickets.

<h3 id="e49">Japanese Arrest Passengers on Chongming Boat - Chongming Guerrillas Active, Japanese Suffer Heavy Losses - "Informants" Falsely Accuse Civilians and Lead to Arrests <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The Pudong Southern District Branch of the Japanese Special Service Agency, together with the Japanese Military Police Detachment of the Floating Hotel, arrested two men and one woman passengers on a Chongming boat in the Suzhou Creek the day before yesterday. Following this, they arrested a man on a Chongming sailboat in the Yangshupu area, totaling three men and one woman. All are currently detained in the Southern District Branch Detention Center on Dongchang Road. Qiao Ben, the director of the Southern District, secretly interrogated them under severe torture. All were ordinary civilians and gave no confessions. It has now been learned that the truth of this case is that the Chinese guerrillas on Chongming Island outside Songkou are very active, controlling most of the land. The Japanese have suffered heavy losses and have been unable to "eliminate" them. They have therefore recruited dozens of local bandits and assigned them to the Japanese Special Service Agency in Shanghai as informants to investigate the movements of the guerrillas between Chongming and Shanghai. These people originally relied on robbery and kidnapping for a living. After being severely suppressed by the guerrillas, they had no place to stand and surrendered to the Japanese, using the opportunity to lead arrests of guerrillas to gain merit and vent their anger. However, the guerrillas are too numerous, and the bandits do not know the members. It is not easy to identify and arrest them. Therefore, since March, they have had no success. Fearing that the Japanese would doubt them, they falsely accused civilians of being guerrillas the day before yesterday and led the Japanese to arrest them for no reason. These four people had more than a thousand yuan in legal tender, two gold watches, and two gold rings, which were all confiscated. Their lives are also in danger. This shows the wickedness and cruelty of the bandit detectives in harming innocent people.</p>

Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened the First Criminal Court and announced the verdict.

<p>Mr. Wei Tuo Encourages Children: Primary school education expert Mr. Wei Tuo wrote an article yesterday entitled "How to Commemorate Today's Children's Day," which is of great value. The following is an excerpt from the article, "Encouraging Children to Promote the Work of Spiritual Mobilization":</p>
<p>Children, what kind of place is Shanghai? Shanghai is a place where the spirit is most depressed and the spirit is most degenerate. If you want to promote the work of spiritual mobilization, then your own spirit should be quickly and greatly transformed: 1. Strictly abide by discipline: (1) wake up early and go to bed early; (2) study and work on time; (3) abide by national laws; (4) obey school rules and obey parents; (5) be polite to others; (6) eliminate all personal interests. 2.

<h3 id="e73">Singapore Chinese Football Team Arrives in Hong Kong from the Philippines: Four Wins and One Loss in the Philippines; Two Unfortunate Losses in Hong Kong <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) The Singapore Chinese Football Team, invited by the Philippines to compete, departed from Singapore on the 13th of this month. After arriving in the Philippines, they played five games from the 17th to the 26th, winning four and losing one, achieving satisfactory results. After the competition in the Philippines, they came to Hong Kong to schedule three major matches, all managed by the South China Athletic Association, as they were responsible for hosting the team. The team of 21 initially intended to arrive in Hong Kong on the 31st via the China Clipper seaplane, but because the flight was rescheduled to April 2nd, they changed to the "Flying Hotel" Boeing Clipper California yesterday morning at 7:30. It arrived at Kai Tak Airport sea surface at 12:30 noon. Those who came to welcome them included Mo Qing, Zhang Wendong, Li Huitang, and many Chinese and Western reporters.</p>
<p>Original leader Shen Guantou was temporarily unable to travel with the team due to business matters. Deng Yuehan was promoted to leader and coach. Secretary Cao Qiulin, Captain Xu Houkun, and Vice-Captain Ji Youling, the list of the team is as follows:</p>
<p>Leader and Coach: Deng Yuehan</p>
<p>Secretary: Cao Qiulin</p>
<p>Captain: Xu Houkun</p>
<p>Vice-Captain: Ji Youling</p>
<p>Players: Li Botang, Feng Huiwen, Chen Jiawan, Ye Maofa, Sun Chunlai, Ye Dade, Li Yiyou, Zhu Chenggui, Cai Yuehan, Wu Gushi, Xia Zhixiang, Xie Qingfu, Wen Guanzong, Long Liewu, Li Haizhu, He Guocai, Guan Xinde</p>
<p>Excellent Cooperation</p>
<p>All staff and players stayed in Room 305 of the Sens Hotel. According to Captain Xu, in the five games in the Philippines, it was possible to win all the games, but the third game was lost due to several players being injured. It is understood that the Philippine League Championship was won by the YCO team this year (the captain and left inside forward of the Philippine team who came to Hong Kong for the intercity match a month ago, Bausili, and the left winger Biji, are the pillars of the team). The Singapore Chinese team met this team in the fourth game in the Philippines and defeated them by three to one. In the fifth game, they met the all-Philippine team and also won by two to zero. Based on this, it proves that the Singapore Chinese team is very strong.</p>
<p>The team excels in short passing tactics and has excellent cooperation skills (any football team that excels in short passing must have excellent cooperation skills). All players are energetic and excellent in heading the ball, so they won the Singapore League Championship for two consecutive years, which is not accidental. When they set off, they were exhausted, but they won two goals against the Philippine elites. It can be seen that their skills are superb.</p>
<p>Results in the Philippines</p>
<p>17th Evening: Won against the All-Philippine B Team, Five to Two</p>
<p>18th: Won against Santo Tomas, Three to Zero</p>
<p>22nd: Lost to La Salle, Two to Four</p>
<p>24th: Won against YCO, Three to One</p>
<p>26th: Won against the All-Philippine Team, Two to Zero</p>

<p>The Kobe Canadian Chinese High School Basketball Team was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today on the Canadian Empress. However, due to fog encountered by the ship en route, it will not arrive until tomorrow afternoon. Therefore, tonight's game against Jinan University Affiliated High School will be difficult to hold. According to the China Youth Sports Department, the game has been canceled. Because the order of the Canadian Chinese games on the 3rd has been arranged, and the China Youth gym has also been rented out on Saturday, it is impossible to reschedule the game. All tickets sold can be refunded at the association. Tonight's exhibition match between China Youth and Fudan alumni has also been canceled. A charity match will be scheduled for the two teams at a later date. However, the American Children's authorities stated that the game will be postponed, and the date will be determined after the Canadian Chinese team arrives in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e80">The Meaning of Life <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>No matter who it is, seeing a lively child, no one does not feel the meaning of life. Even the most stubborn and desolate old man will increase some interest in life because of it. Then Children's Day can simply be regarded as the festival of life, and we should celebrate it once a year.</p>
<p>Children's Day is set on April 4th, one or two days before Qingming Festival, which can indeed best express the meaning of life. Because at that time, the severe winter has completely passed, all things are revived, and they are beginning to flourish. We originally regarded this time as a good day and festival in the year, and now with Children's Day, it complements each other.</p>
<p>In the West, there is also Easter at this time. Its function does contain religious colors, but in terms of the operation of nature, this is originally the time for all things to return to spring, then resurrection can be used as the rebirth of all things. Rebirth is returning to youth, and children are the rebirth of the elderly, which also increases the meaning of Children's Day.</p>
<p>If we regard the Yellow Flower Festival on March 29th as a symbol of death, then this Children's Day on April 4th can be regarded as a symbol of life. Going from death to life, it is fine to regard Children's Day as our spiritual Easter.</p>
<p>These are all talking about the usual Children's Day, but on this Children's Day during the War of Resistance, the meaning is felt to be even deeper.</p>
<p>Children are future adults. In this great era, we have many things and endless responsibilities that we want them to take on, so we must cultivate them well and make them reproduce endlessly, exceeding everything we have. "Ten years of gathering, ten years of teaching," we should act accordingly to achieve the wish of "annexing Wu."</p>
<p>The Republic of China has been revived from an ancient country of thousands of years. This revival project is only at the starting point, like a child, only at the most naive age. Now, suddenly encountering adversity is like the tender buds on a tree encountering frost and snow. We must cherish her with the heart of cherishing children, so that she can take root and become a great country.</p>
<p>Therefore, on Children's Day, we must realize the meaning of life, especially the meaning of the life of the country and nation.</p>
<p>In addition, everyone has a desire to live, but everyone also has a prohibition against harming life. Harming the lives of others to seek one's own life is a scourge to mankind and must be severely punished, even removing them from humanity. Now, there are such scourges who do not hinder their lives, but come to harm our lives. For our own lives, we can only fight to the end and eliminate them!</p>
<p>This is my final understanding of life. I hope we all unite and work hard!</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Wilderness <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>Rushing down the hillside, braving a gust of bleak cold air. I thought, it's already early spring, why is the wilderness still frozen, without a hint of green? Grim and desolate, a gust of wind blows through the grass on the graves, even emitting a terrifying, piercing sound.</p>
<p>I stopped, gazing at the desolate graves: the scattered, withered weeds, the decaying thorns, interwoven into a yellow carpet, spread out before me; the tombstones lie there, a scene of barren coldness and stillness, no one to mourn, no poet to sing its praises.</p>
<p>"Right here! Take the desolate graves as our stronghold, the coffins as our gun racks, we can face the highway ahead."</p>
<p>Old Qiang, who spoke these words, immediately swung his mud shovel, easily digging a hole two feet in diameter as if digging a steamed bun. He squeezed his body into it, waiting silently, gripping the machine gun and glaring out through a small hole! After we flattened the dug-up soil and weeds, we quickly hurried through the thicket.</p>
<p>This area was considered "swept" clear, and the smell of gunpowder in the air seemed to have disappeared. The Japanese devils were so pleased, wriggling like a long snake on the winding highway, those scattered black figures, like wild dogs searching for food; Old Qiang, lying in ambush in the desolate grave, watched until his eyes were burning with fire, but he had no choice but to endure, holding his breath, letting time quietly pass. From early morning to noon, and then to dusk, he hid like a silkworm lying in its cocoon, so concealed, remembering the captain's instructions: --The Japanese devils think this area has been "swept" clear, wait until their guard is down, estimate when we can annihilate a sufficient number, then strike!</p>
<p>The scattered figures of the Japanese devils stirred his anger, countless times, ultimately suppressed by replaying the instructions; continuing to wait, to watch, to estimate, delaying for dozens of hours.</p>
<p>Time was approaching dusk on the second day.</p>
<p>In the silent twilight, a clamor came from the highway, three Japanese devils with handlebar mustaches and gold-rimmed glasses, rode up on tall horses, their command sabers flashing with brilliant silver light, smug and arrogant, followed by a large group. The motorcycles bumped along the highway, looking very heavy, probably loaded with ammunition?</p>
<p>At this moment, Old Qiang thought to himself and smiled; the fire of anger burned again, violently and swiftly, through his whole body; he gripped the machine gun: --Rat-tat-tat… a burst of fierce strafing.</p>
<p>The men with handlebar mustaches and wire-rimmed glasses, immediately fell off their horses, collapsing one after another, blood splattering everywhere. The Japanese devils behind, those who weren’t dead, were all stunned in fright, frantically firing in all directions, the sky crisscrossed, forming a net of fire, enveloping the empty wilderness.</p>
<p>The Japanese devils were probably wondering? Was this the human world, or a dream? Staring, they saw only the silent, deathly forest and desolate graves in the wilderness, with no one there.</p>
<p>As they ran to surround the forest, Old Qiang laughed until his stomach hurt, and he lay down to eat dry rations.</p>
<p>After a burst of running, Old Qiang fired another burst, under the net of fire, no one knew how many Japanese devils had fallen.</p>
<p>The night gradually deepened, the empty-handed Japanese devils were still terrified, anxious, and angry; they relied on their sophisticated equipment to unleash its destructive power: --Boom… thump… thud…. The mountain guns shook the entire wilderness, flames spread across the dry weeds; Old Qiang's blood also boiled, but he more calmly stroked the machine gun handle: Rat-tat-tat… and then he laughed again.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Before Sunrise <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>Who has ever sailed in a small boat, drifting on a black sea, through the long dark night, a tiny life gripped tight in the waves, rising and falling, chasing the tide, full of terror, sorrow and hope, and finally, while praying for light, saw a red sun rise on the horizon, slowly ascending, gradually the whole universe became warm, isn't this joy no less than the joy of rebirth?</p>
<p>It is the joy of light, you say, is it not also the pleasure of rebirth?</p>
<p>Rain makes people feel dull, fog makes people foolish, and night makes people irritable, who has ever suffered from insomnia? Even if it's for a month or two, a night or two, tossing and turning in bed, the mind entangled in a myriad of thoughts. Who can bear it? No sun, no light, no heat, not to mention no warmth or joy. Trapped in the heavy siege of the night, people are often lonely, without companions, without similar voices, perhaps you cry out because of frightening phantoms, but afterward you may even find that you were mute and silent.</p>
<p>At this time, is there anything more lovely than the sound of a rooster? Before you have even glimpsed the faint dawn, the clever harbinger has already announced it to you. No need to worry about no light, no heat, no joy, no warmth. It is often a happy message, the tall treetops, daubed with a light layer of rouge, the vast distant sky, revealing a layer of hazy fish-belly white, the sea, so blurred and ever-changing, reflecting the golden waves like fish scales.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have been trapped in nightmares, entangled in them, plunged into dangerous situations, awkward situations, situations of crying, when you are distressed, in danger, or even when you are crying, suddenly a ray of dawn shines on your face through the window lattices, containing infinite warmth. In half-doubt and half-belief, you hear the sound of a rooster crowing, finally, you resolutely push away the dream. At this time, you see the rebirth of light, how can you not be joyful?</p>
<p>However, please think, why were you not swallowed up by the darkness? You can see the light again, you are happy, but why are you happy?</p>
<p>Are there not many people crawling in the dark, panting, and silently collapsing? They crawl from the darkness toward the light, like climbing a tower, gazing at the spire, at the sunlight, some sighing that they have no strength to climb, willing to squat in the darkness; some impatiently stop climbing, they fall, staggering, into every corner. Some people are the most unfortunate, they have endured the whole night, battling the darkness countless times, unfortunately disappointed, at the end of the night, when the last drops of time run out, just as they are about to see the top of the tower. They are swallowed up by the darkness, with no chance to see the sun again.</p>
<p>The long night makes people pessimistic, and moreover, there are many nightmares, we fear the night, fear the darkness, and even more fear the dark dreams, therefore, we look forward to the sun, the sun gives us laughter and warmth.</p>
<p>Although it is only a weak light, it is the source of light. After a long night of fighting, not being swallowed up by the darkness, we have heard the sound of a rooster crowing again, this is the first sound of human joy.</p>
<p>The rooster has crowed. But the dawn has not yet fully broken, some people hide in the darkness, shouting about the darkness. The time before sunrise is the most agonizing, because the night is so long, longer than midnight, longer than the first watch. Although there is sunlight, there is still darkness.</p>
<p>Moreover, before sunrise, there are still many people swallowed up by the darkness.</p>
<p>Only those who constantly seek light can grasp the morning sun, step forward to meet it, and watch those clowns disappear one by one in the sunlight.</p>
<p>The rooster has crowed. But the dawn has not yet fully broken. Before sunrise, you need patience!</p>

<p>— Gu Gong</p>
<p>(Aishima Takeo's "A Message to the Young," will move every "grown-up" who reads it. I hope this "Message to My Son" will resonate with every father.)</p>
<p>Today is Children's Day, and you are all very happy. Unfortunately, I, your father, have been unemployed due to the war and have no gifts to give you. I can only say a few words to you, which will serve as my way of celebrating this day with you. You are all good children, and you are willing to listen to me, right?</p>
<p>Of course, you are still very young now. Ah Da is only nine years old, and Ah Er is only seven. But Ah Da is already in the third grade of elementary school, and Ah Er is in the second grade. Usually, listening to you speak, I can tell that you also have a strong sense of national and ethnic identity, and you know how to hate our enemies with gritted teeth. This makes me very happy. Then what I want to say to you, you will understand, and my words will not be in vain.</p>
<p>I say to you, first, when you grow up, you don't need to be particularly filial to me. At most, treat me as a fellow citizen, and I will be satisfied. Because I have raised you entirely for the sake of the country, for the sake of the entire nation. When you grow up and are willing to do your best for the country and the nation, that is being filial to me, and you are already, unknowingly, being filial to me now. You call me "good daddy"; you are affectionate with me; you love me. When I am happy and see you, I am even happier. When I am unhappy and see you, I turn sorrow into joy. You give me much joy and comfort. You make me energetic in my work, because I think I am fighting for you, I have a purpose. You make my daily life meaningful, because I have to raise you up... All in all, you have already repaid me greatly in invisible ways, which is being filial to me, and I am already very satisfied. When you grow up, you will have greater responsibilities. I don't want to monopolize you, and I don't want to hinder your great future in the slightest. That is why I don't want you to be particularly filial to me again. Good children, you must keep my words in your hearts and put them into practice when you grow up.</p>
<p>Your "good daddy" has your "good grandmother" and "great grandmother" above him, and yourselves below him -- your "good mother" is capable of living independently --, so he cannot fully serve the country and the nation, and he has always regretted this in his heart. If you grow up and dedicate yourselves completely to the country and the nation, fulfilling his duties, you will truly be filial sons. You must be such filial sons.</p>
<p>You have promised me, and I am truly happy. Then, second, I want to tell you what I hope you will do.</p>
<p>I am an impatient person, I don't like beating around the bush, and I always like things to be straightforward and quick. So when you grow up, if your physique passes the test, I hope you will both join the Air Force. Ah Da is more stable, so perhaps he can pilot a bomber, and Ah Er is more nimble, so perhaps he can pilot a fighter plane. In the event that your physique doesn't pass the test, then you should join the artillery corps and become artillerymen. In modern warfare, airplanes and cannons are important weapons, and we must eliminate our enemies, so I hope so. To go one step further, if you cannot join the artillery corps, then you can join any kind of army. In short, when you grow up you must save the country and save the nation; to save the country and save the nation, you must become soldiers.</p>
<p>If -- and I really don't want to say this -- you are like me, and you have not been in good health since childhood, and your eyesight is also poor, making you unsuitable for being soldiers, then what I hope for you is to study national defense engineering or national defense chemistry. In the future, our "Maginot Line," or the invention and manufacture of any poison gas, will have your contribution. Ordinary engineering or chemistry, or other practical subjects, can certainly also save the country and the nation, and I would not disapprove of you studying them if you like. But I say again, I am an impatient person, and when the situation is critical, I feel even more that I cannot wait. I always hope that you will engage in military work most effectively.</p>
<p>Finally, I tell you, I least want you to be like your "good daddy," who only knows a few words, can move his pen, is never full or warm in his life, and can at most be a basic, law-abiding citizen, who is not of much help to the country and the nation. Now, seeing the enemy rampaging everywhere like a beast, although his heart is bursting with anger, he cannot personally kill them and drive them away. Your "good daddy" died long ago when his "good daddy" died, so he had no one to guide him, and the burden of the family was heavy, so that his temples are gradually frosting, and he has accomplished nothing. Now you have him to guide you, to relieve you of your internal worries, this is your good fortune, and you should make it your life's career to defeat the enemy and prevent them from entering the country!</p>
<p>Remember well, Ah Da and Ah Er, my sons: I want you to become soldiers! If you cannot become soldiers, then engage in occupations related to national defense! By all means, do not do what I have done! Do not worry about me! In this way, you will be filial sons! You can rest assured that your "mother" agrees with me!</p>
<p>My sons, I am truly happy: your little fists are raised, you have listened to my words. Really, the enemy is bullying us like this, if we do not avenge this hatred, can we still be considered human beings! My sons, grow up quickly!</p>

<h3 id="e86">Finance: European Situation Slightly Eases, Spot Price Rises After Falling, Hong Kong Exchange Rate Tightens: Foreign Banks Return to Absorb <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold price on the black market suddenly stopped falling and turned to rise. This was because the situation in Europe had slightly eased, the Hong Kong exchange rate continued to weaken, a certain foreign bank returned to absorb, and a certain money exchange also stopped selling and started buying. Therefore, the morale of all parties changed from fatigue to stability, and they were close to the 2070 yuan mark. However, it had once slightly fallen in the middle due to the selling of gold houses, but ultimately, the supply could not meet the demand, and it was difficult to maintain for a long time. As a result, it rose 9 yuan, with flat trading, about 550 taels. Jewelry gold also returned to a high of 1 yuan. Customs gold was stable, and Sino-British pure gold, etc. all slightly fell.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rose 9 Yuan Yesterday</p>
<p>Since early morning, each bar (ten taels) initially had scarce supply and demand, so there was no trading for a long time. Until 9:50, because a certain bank suddenly bought on behalf of a foreign firm, trading was seen, and the market was quite stable under the buying of foreign firms and spot gold houses. First, a certain bank bought 50 taels each from a jewelry shop and a gold house, at the opening price of 2063 yuan, which was 3 yuan higher than the weekend. Afterwards, a certain spot gold house also bought a total of 100 taels from a jewelry shop at the same price. Following this, a certain money exchange bought 50 taels from a gold house at the price of 64 yuan. Later, a certain bank also bought 50 taels from a gold house at the price of 63 yuan. A certain money exchange bought 50 taels from a jewelry shop at the price of 65 yuan, and another money exchange bought 50 taels from a gold house at the price of 66 yuan. After this, because jewelry shops and gold houses took advantage of the high price to sell, it slightly fell. A jewelry shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange at the price of 65 yuan, and a gold house sold 50 taels to a money exchange at the price of 62 yuan. It was already 11:40. After this, the buying intention of the buyers was strong again, but the sellers had stopped selling and were watching, so no trading was seen. The closing price at noon was still 62 yuan. In the afternoon, because the Hong Kong exchange rate continued to weaken, the buying trend was stronger, but the sellers were still watching. Therefore, in the thin trading, it rose 5 yuan at the opening, first with a gold house trading 50 taels with another gold house at the price of 67 yuan. Later, at 3:30, another jewelry shop traded 50 taels with another jewelry shop, at the closing price of 2069 yuan. As a result, it rose 9 yuan compared to the weekend, with a daily difference of 7 yuan. The selling price of spot gold houses was 2075 yuan, and the buying price was 2065 yuan. The current standard gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there was no trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Increased by 1 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael was not changed at first. But at 2:40, because the spot gold price showed a firm trend, it also increased by 1 yuan. Da Tong Hang changed to 210 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang was 208 yuan, with a buying price of 202 yuan.</p>
<p>The Decline in Customs Pure Gold was Very Slight</p>
<p>The Central Bank's Chinese cash purchase price has dropped to 1212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed Customs gold price remained flat, calculated at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also fell by 3 jiao, calculated at 1207 yuan and 6 jiao. This was due to the fact that the London price of British pure gold on April 1 fell by half a pence per ounce, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Foreign Exchange Still Lacking Change, Tianjin Gang Once Dumped Hong Kong Exchange Rate Buying Enthusiasm Revived <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market was dominated by oil companies, Mobil, and other foreign firms, who came to settle their accounts, but foreign banks such as HSBC still had a strong intention to supply, and the Tianjin gang once dumped. Therefore, the supply and demand were balanced, and the price remained stable. As a result, there was still no clear winner or loser, and the trading was slightly active. After Reuters reported the news of the Hong Kong dollar being about to depreciate last Friday, speculators in the city tended to come out, so the price was quite loose amidst a chorus of selling. However, the buying enthusiasm soon revived, so it weakened again.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, London's large amounts of near-term and long-term contracts continued to increase by 0.0625, the New York silver price remained flat, and the London spot gold price fell by half a pence. The exchange rates of the British pound against the US dollar, the French franc, and the Shanghai yuan were unchanged. The US dollar against the British pound, the French franc, and the Shanghai yuan also did not rise or fall, but rose by 3 fen against the Shanghai yuan. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening selling price in the morning was 8 pence and 25 for the British pound, and 16 yuan and 0625 for the US dollar, which were both flat compared to the weekend. After opening, foreign firms took advantage of the opportunity to sell on behalf of the Tianjin gang, so the market was more stable. A profitable firm sold British pounds to Hua Yi for 8 pence and 25. HSBC announced that the listed price would not change, and the silver balance tax was announced to be just over half a point, calculated at slightly 5.00%. After this, although major foreign firms successively settled their accounts, the intention of British and American banks to supply was quite strong, so it remained quite stable. Foreign firms settled their accounts with HSBC, Holland, and Mecca British pounds for 8 pence and 25. Shuangyou settled with a certain Dutch bank US dollars for 16 yuan and 0625. Near noon, Chinese firms, East Asia, and Guangdong gangs all competed to buy Hong Kong exchange rate, so the potential trend tightened. However, the Chinese merchant yarn and flower gang suddenly dumped, so it slightly hardened, calculated as Chinese firm East Asia Guangdong gang absorbed Chinese merchant yarn and flower gang and money exchange Hong Kong exchange rate 55 yuan and 875, weakened to 625, and then hardened back to 75. By the noon closing, the bank's selling price for both British and American exchanges was the same as the morning opening.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, profitable firms first bought British pounds for 8 pence and 25, followed by the oil company Mobil settling with a certain Dutch bank US dollars for 16 yuan and 0625, so the process remained without much change. Afterwards, foreign firms, Anda, Overseas Chinese, and East Asia absorbed Hong Kong exchange rate from money exchanges, from 55 yuan and 75, weakened to 625, the situation continued to tighten. By the late closing, the bank's selling price was 8 pence and 25 for the British pound, and 16 yuan and 0625 for the US dollar. As a result, compared to the Saturday noon closing, both British and American exchanges had no gain or loss, while the Hong Kong exchange rate continued to weaken by 25.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Hong Kong Dollar Rose <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Last Saturday, British pure gold fell by half a pence, and the British and American exchange rates did not change. Yesterday, foreign exchange in this city, foreign firms settled their accounts frequently, and foreign banks and Hong Kong telegraph provided very smoothly, and the cash position was quite ample. The market price was stable as before. At the opening of the spot gold market, it was strong. Money exchanges had a strong intention to buy, and the market price rose slowly. Suddenly, gold houses and jewelry businesses took advantage of the high price to sell, and the market price returned to weakness. In the afternoon, the Hong Kong gang of money exchanges bought in large quantities, and the supply from retail gold houses, etc. was not strong, and the market price rose again. After the closing, they still wanted to buy in, and the sellers were scarce. The daily rise and fall was sudden and unpredictable. As a result, the market was tight, foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, were beautiful because spot gold was upright, and the need for wealth increased again.

<p>Securities in the gray market showed a slight turnaround in trend yesterday. This was due to the international situation appearing somewhat more moderate, coupled with a wavering atmosphere of peace beginning to sprout. There were also signs that the exchange was actively preparing to resume operations, and rumors of new international loans to China being established. Although these various reports lack concrete evidence, they are not entirely without cause. Therefore, the cloud of market depression seemed to gradually clear, and those who had shorted the market began to hesitate. The bullish side gained the upper hand on the trading floor, showing signs of continued rise. Throughout yesterday, both "Tiansheng" and No. 35, which had been sold off for many days, saw buying interest. No. 7 also experienced considerable absorption. Although No. 38 saw some selling of Class C shares, and De Fu Feng Da also made slight moves, it was apparent that the supply of shares was insufficient to meet demand. In the afternoon, rumors suddenly spread about a sharp increase in cotton yarn prices, leading to large purchases by the yarn and cloth merchants. Class C and E shares broke through major levels once again. Runli and No. 35 saw the most enthusiastic buying, and Hongda also had strong demand. Retail investors also absorbed shares vigorously in small quantities. Tongkang and Nos. 41 and 42 saw some unloading. The trading floor became increasingly tight, and a rising trend gradually emerged. The prospects for further gains are quite possible. As a result, prices rose by 4 to 5.5 jiao. The total trading volume was estimated to be around 700,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below:</p>

<p>After falling for many days, yarn prices rebounded sharply yesterday, with a significant surge. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn had been declining sharply from 386 yuan due to the abandonment of orders by Yu Chang, reaching a low of 365 yuan on March 28, a difference of 21 yuan. This sharp drop led to demand from southern China, including Hong Kong, Yunnan, and Chaozhou. Today, the Guangbang Wanxing company purchased 500 to 600 bales of 20-count Tiannv Double Horse yarn on behalf of the Hong Kong and Shantou merchants. Market floating shares were snapped up, causing market sentiment to shake and buying to surge. The market price jumped 3 yuan. Subsequently, many bulls in the same industry, who had been accumulating for a long time, viewed the changing environment and made every effort to buy in the market, pushing prices up higher, resulting in an even stronger upward trend. Generally speaking, a rebound was possible due to deep declines and strong real demand. However, after such intense price increases, yarn sales will be affected again. Market conditions continued to rise in the afternoon, and there was even more active trading among peers. Market sentiment was unusually excited. The现出(current price) of 20-count Double Horse has already reached 383 yuan, an increase of 8 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Regarding the current yarn situation, at the beginning of the morning market, the Hong Kong merchants were very active, opening the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn up 3 yuan to 378 yuan. The Guangbang purchased 40 bales on behalf, but still had an appetite. Market conditions suddenly improved, and buying became stronger. The trading floor suddenly became tight, and the market price became more expensive, jumping beyond the 80 yuan mark. The highest price was 382 yuan, with a slight pullback of 1 or 2 yuan in the middle. In the afternoon, some peers, based on the development of spot sales, pulled in even more strongly. The market trend was extremely sharp, rising another 2 yuan. It was found that the total amount bought by various merchants throughout the day was 3,330 bales. The prices of 20-count Double Horse rose by 8 yuan, Tiannv rose by 7 yuan and a half, Tejincheng rose by 9 yuan, and Muyang rose by 6 yuan. The factory opened 300 bales of 10-count Baoyi from the Hongzhang factory at a price of 294 yuan. The Chongxin factory opened 100 bales of 20-count Dafa at a price of 368 yuan. The Xinyu factory opened 130 bales of 10-count Double Earth at a price of 295 yuan. The Anda factory opened 200 bales of 10-count Flying Tiger at a price of 290 yuan to 291 yuan.

<p>Tianjin　250　Quanzhou　10</p>

<p>The Japanese yarn market continues to move forward, and the rising trend is fierce. According to the market, there are too many short positions, and there are signs of a squeeze. However, actual sales are only smooth in North China, while other aspects are still normal. The spot price of 20-count Shuiyue yarn is 348 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Lanfeng yarn is 339 yuan, an increase of 3 to 4 yuan compared to the weekend.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Coarse Velvet Raw Materials Are Especially Popular, Yao Clothing Rises Another Yuan, Brazilian Cotton Shipped in July and August Has Been Ordered <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The local cotton business is unusually deserted, and factory demand is very sluggish. In reality, the selling price is high, and the source is dry. Moreover, local stocks are becoming increasingly fragile, thus forming an awkward situation. It's in a state of near suspension. As for Indian cotton, the exchange price is indeed low, but the quality is inferior, making factory work very difficult. Judging from this situation, manufacturers are currently in a difficult situation. However, coarse velvet cotton raw materials are especially popular. Factories have active sales of 10-count yarn, so Yao clothing has risen another yuan. Other market conditions remain calm. The source of Subei is still not thin. Yesterday and today, 1,562 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived, and 4,650 pieces were transported from Ningbo yesterday. The current cotton situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market price: The European situation is deteriorating, securities are falling continuously, and the New York cotton market is therefore quite weak. Washington has not yet made progress on the issue of loan cotton. It is reported that members of parliament will convene a meeting today to continue discussing the cotton industry. Yesterday, New York continued to fall by 5 to 6 pounds due to mass selling. India fell one rupee, including forecasts, and Egypt fell ten pounds. Yesterday's exchange rate did not fluctuate much. Converted into legal currency, cotton prices rose and fell. American cotton and Brazilian cotton fell by 4 jiao per dan, Indian cotton fell by 3 jiao and a half, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than one yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Yesterday turned quiet again, not becoming lively due to the rise in yarn prices. This is because factories are waiting for the US government to resolve the loan cotton issue. In recent days, Brazilian cotton transactions have been particularly active, already reaching shipments for July and August. The shipping route from South America to China takes about two months, so Brazilian cotton ordered now will arrive in Shanghai in September and October. The calculated factory delivery prices for foreign cotton yesterday are listed below:</p>
<p>Raw Material　Category　Delivered to Factory Including Tax</p>
<p>60-count Egyptian cotton High grade　102.75</p>

<h3 id="e94">Piece Goods: Dongpi World, Wuhu Has Strong Demand, Unfortunately Most Are Not Domestic Goods, Autumn Goods Are Being Sold in Large Quantities, Japanese Factories Are Already Engaging in Hoarding <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Due to the sharp rise in Eastern silk fabrics and fine twill in domestic cloth, dyed and finished piece goods, market sentiment has become very firm, and various factory products have increased prices, by 1 jiao to 2 jiao and a half per piece. Wholesale business in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong merchants and local street stores have improved. Large-scale purchases have also occurred in the ports of the guerrilla areas, Wuhu and Bengbu. It is said that various parts of Anhui are concentrating in Wuhu to purchase goods. Shipping cloth is very profitable, with a profit of 1 to 2 yuan per piece of goods worth 10 yuan. Domestic cloth accounts for only 10% to 20% of sales, and the export of local goods is subject to Japanese control, making remittances difficult. Therefore, guest merchants are greatly restricted in shipping goods. Guangdong merchants have added more than 200 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, poplin, fine cloth and fine twill. Sichuan and Yunnan merchants purchased more than 3,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached twill, bleached cloth and poplin. Ordered goods from various factories are reported to be shipped steadily. The quoted price of Dongpi's autumn fabric, broadcloth, has increased. Various Chinese factories have a strong demand for blanks for autumn clothing, line cloth and woolen cloth. Tens of thousands of pieces have been ordered for July and August shipments. The current sales of white goods show a slight turnaround. The local street office purchased more than 100 packages of Jardine Matheson coarse cloth, mostly at a higher weight. Dye factories purchased 70 to 80 packages of fine twill, and the price remains stable.</p>
<p>Due to the continued strong purchases by merchants in the northern route, the market sentiment for Dongbu fine cloth and fine twill is excited. The price of fine cloth has risen sharply by 2 jiao per piece, and the price of fine twill has risen by 1 jiao and 5 fen.成交(Transaction) by local merchants reached a huge amount of more than 2,000 pieces. It is said that Japanese factories have limited inventory and are now closed and not selling, so foreign firms have no goods to open. They are engaged in buying and hoarding to wait for a good price. Therefore, peers have tightened their goods and there is a tendency for continued increases.</p>
<p>1,400 pieces of export cloth were shipped to Tianjin on the 4th.</p>

<p>Navy blue water-repellent woolen fabric is in high demand among Western-style tailors. It's also the reason for replacing the shortage of medium-thick broadcloth. Its water resistance is stronger than broadcloth and other woolen fabrics. Yesterday, British-made navy blue water-repellent woolen fabrics generally sold for more than 10 yuan. Shen-woven fabrics, with more domestic mainland products, wholesale for 5 yuan, 7 jiao and a half per yard, No. 1 for 6 yuan and 6 jiao, Jardine Matheson for 5 yuan and 5 jiao, Yongxing for 5 yuan, and Hongkang for 4 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Silk and Tea: The Future of Silk Prices Will Depend on the Shift in Foreign Sales <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market was sluggish, with New York closed on Sunday and Yokohama closed due to a holiday. Therefore, the situation in this city is even more sluggish. Based on the current market conditions, observing the future trend of the silk market, the local silk price will shift from the support of domestic customers to the embrace of foreign sales for practical use. In other words, if recent silk sales continue to be sluggish, the silk price will continue to be sluggish after soaring and plummeting (currently, the silk price is calculated based on Class B 7/8 white factory, the highest price was 1,900 yuan, and now it is only 1,550 yuan, a drop of 350 yuan). It will inevitably become more and more tired and fall below the 1,500 yuan mark. On the contrary, if domestic and foreign raw silk this year can maintain 1,500-1,600 yuan due to the thin inventory of raw materials, it still seems possible.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local silk market saw inquiries from American and British-French firms, but unfortunately the limited prices in the accounts were too harsh to be accepted by manufacturers. However, some transactions were made. White factory RR was 1,550 yuan, and French silk was 1,500 yuan, which is still under negotiation. Double palace silk was 1,040 yuan. Yesterday, there were continued deals. As for the user side, the general psychology is more bearish, and buyers have returned prices to 1,500 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Food: Flour Mill Prices Have Been Unified, Restoring the Previous Price of 4 Yuan and 4 Jiao <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Factory Flour: Yesterday, the spot flour market conditions in this factory gradually became more expensive. Checking customer transactions, it was more active than before. It is said that the flour previously handled by the Hebei and Shandong merchants has been gradually shipped in recent days, so the new demand can be called continuous. However, since the factory has engaged in special price competition several times, it is unwilling to sell at a discount again. In the morning, a batch of warships was成交(transaction) at 4 yuan and 3 jiao and a half. In the afternoon, the North Ocean merchant price, car and ship brand has been uniformly restored to the previous price of 4 yuan and 4 jiao, the same price as the Nanyang merchants in this street. As a result, the factory price began to be unified. The total成交(transaction) volume of the unified market was nearly 100,000 bags, with the North Ocean merchants still accounting for the majority of sales, followed by the Nanyang merchants and the street merchants.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour: Yesterday, the foreign flour market also tended to stabilize. In terms of sources, in addition to the whole batch waiting to arrive soon, there were still scattered small shipments arriving. It is said that the prices of American and Australian products have not changed much. Futures transactions still feel lacking. However, the current floating stock has been reduced in recent days, and the goods in the hands of large households are unwilling to sell at a discount due to cost considerations. Therefore, the market is gradually entering a stable track. High-end brands insist on the spot price of 4 yuan and 1 jiao in cash, and mid-range brands are also calling for 4 yuan and 1 jiao. However, according to people in the industry, a large batch of foreign flour will arrive soon, and the market may still have a period of confusion before it can gradually get on the right track.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday and the day before, the source of local wheat slightly arrived, but they were all scattered small tickets, mostly directly distributed, and there was no formal market. It is said that the local wheat needed by Shanghai flour mills recently is directly purchased from the producing areas, so the goods supplied sporadically in the market have a very scattered intention, and the market has stopped again.</p>
<p>Foreign Wheat: Today, there is another arrival in Shanghai, which is the Baohe Foreign Firm Salvus previously reported by this newspaper, shipping wheat from Australia to Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to be imported tomorrow. Yesterday, the firm received a telegram from the ship saying that it would arrive this morning, carrying a total of 7,990 tons of wheat, berthed at Yangshupu buoy numbers 35 and 36 for unloading. It is said that the Australian wheat was purchased by the Liji Foreign Firm on Sichuan Road. (祖)</p>

<p>Superior Japonica Rice: Yesterday, the various gangs arrived from Hebei at the 6th and 7th piers. The chariot wheel, baozi, Suzhou, Tongbang and Yixing gangs arrived with more than 2,000 packages. The sales market in this street is not small and is not handled. Hoarders are mostly watching, so although the sellers are trying their best to maintain prices, the effect is very small. Moreover, the成交(transaction) volume of each item is limited, and the market is soft. As a result, the price of thick and thin Japonica rice is a few cents to a jiao less. Du Yangjian, Bu Jianpingping, and Biangwu, which were asked about slightly yesterday, also saw prices stabilize.</p>
<p>客秈(Ke Xian) Rice: Yesterday's digestion was very light. The local merchant warehouses lacked appetite. Currently, the source of 客秈(Ke Xian) rice is arriving in succession. Most people are trending down, and floating merchants and scattered warehouses are especially trying to sell quickly. The market is sluggish and sales are slow. The unified market only opened nearly 1,000 packages of goods from the Big Market, all of which were goods of 12 yuan and 45 jiao, and the price continued to be 1 jiao less. The stock of foreign rice is scarce and lacking in arrivals, and the owners still insist on the original price.</p>

<p>Soybean oil market conditions are in a brewing situation, with prices rising sharply and falling slightly. Because Da Yun was closed yesterday, the Japanese merchants in this city still have no statement on the issue of control, so futures are still difficult to resolve. The hearts of the people in the market are hesitant. Yesterday, there were still transactions being made on the trading floor, mostly profit-taking goods, with a total of 400 barrels of Da Yun oil成交(transaction) at a price of 37 yuan, down 5 jiao from Saturday. 60 pieces of Yanqi opened at a price of 26 yuan and 5 jiao, also down half a yuan.成交(Transaction) for 50 pieces of road goods delivered in three weeks at a price of 26 yuan and 5 jiao. Da You Yu factory oil was listed at the original price of 28 yuan and 8 jiao, which was not the actual成交(transaction) price.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 200 pieces of soybean oil were shipped from Yantai.</p>
<p>During the turmoil of the soybean oil control, speculators inside and outside the industry are on the move, causing the market to rise. Jiao oil continued to rise by 3 yuan, opening at 32 yuan and 31 yuan and 5 jiao,成交(transaction) for 150 pieces, and delivery in April was ordered at 100 pieces at a price of 31 yuan. 200 cans of Tianjin canned oil opened at 40 yuan, and 100 cans of Qingdao canned oil opened at a price of 42 yuan.</p>

<p>Although the yellow soybean market is subject to Dalian's export control, its potential is not affected by the weak sales market. The market price has only increased by a few cents. Yesterday, it was estimated that two cars of Dalian soybeans for delivery in April were opened at a price of 8 yuan, 4 jiao, 8 yuan and 3 jiao and 8 fen. The current soybean成交(transaction) was 4 cars at a price of 8 yuan, 6 jiao and 6 jiao and a half. Chongming sand yellow opened a total of more than 600 packages, and the price was also 8 yuan, 6 jiao and 6 jiao and a half. Delivery by the owner was priced at 8 yuan and 7 jiao. Pinghu Du soybeans are still at 10 yuan, with only 30 packages成交(transaction).</p>

<p>Since the restriction of prices for Qingdao raw peanuts, both the import and export sides have not exceeded the limit. According to a letter yesterday, it was also stipulated that the price should be reduced by another 4 jiao within the period from the 2nd to the 8th of this month, so the product price has returned to a looser state. Now the Southwest Port Ren is 12 yuan and 7 jiao, and the ordinary Shidao Ren is 12 yuan, 8 jiao and 9 jiao. 洋莊办(Foreign firms) handled more than 3,000 packages, large Ren is 13 yuan and 1 jiao, 400 packages.

<p>Yesterday, the trend of foreign sugar continued to rise. The association set the price, and the price of 24 coarse white sugar in this warehouse was raised by 2 jiao to 25 yuan and 2 jiao. 200 to 300 packages of re-exported goods were continuously成交(transaction) at 17 yuan.

<h3 id="e107">Where is Paradise? <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Tan Weihan</p>
<p>Children's Day is here.</p>
<p>I don’t know if the company is really planning for the children, or if they are thinking about their own business. They have already set up the so-called "Children's Paradise."</p>
<p>However, there are two conditions: (1) Clothes must be neat and tidy. (2) Admission by purchase invoice. This cannot but make the homeless, wandering children remain outside the Paradise: Unable to enter the Paradise, they have to钻(bore) into hell.</p>
<p>Here, I am reminded of the Paradise built for children in other countries.</p>
<p>On the New Continent, a priest named Flanagan (E.J.Flanagan) founded a children's city dedicated to educating homeless children, not only providing them with food and lodging, but also educating and shaping their personality. The purpose is to reduce the number of vagrants in society and increase the number of good citizens. Since Children's City was established to accommodate homeless children, there are no ethnic or religious restrictions, nor are they asked where they came from. But there are also two conditions: (1) The children are homeless. (2) As long as the city can accommodate them.</p>
<p>According to the founder: "The reason why I founded Children's City is because I believe that there is no such thing as a bad child in the world. Twenty-one years of experience have made me have no reason to change this idea." Yes, a child will never become a "bad guy" before he reaches adulthood. The problem lies in whether there is good guidance.</p>
<p>In the Children's City, he opened a letterpress printing office, a shoe repair shop, a carpentry workshop, a milk shed, a farm, and a dry cleaning field. Children who learn these careers will be able to support themselves without relying on the relief of charitable organizations when they leave the Children's City.</p>
<p>"When I know that one of my children has become better," Flanagan said, "I feel that the efforts I have put in for these homeless children and the work I have done to create them have not been in vain!" (Editor's note: The "Children's Paradise" which opened in Nanjing Grand Theater in October is a description of Father Flanagan's arduous history of building a children's city.)</p>
<p>Let's take a look at what the Soviet Children's City is like? Regarding this, 程國 君 recorded it in great detail in A Visit to the Soviet Children's City (see the Education Magazine, Volume 27, No. 3). The following are his words:</p>
<p>"No country has as complete facilities for children as the Soviet Children's City. The scope of the Children's City is very large, including places of various shapes and colors that meet the interests and needs of children. It is not only a place for recreation and entertainment, but is established in accordance with children's psychology and scientific principles. On that side, there are scientific research laboratories for studying electricity, aviation, and other land and water transportation equipment, a biological research institute that provides children with knowledge of animals and plants, a club that uses applied science toys to increase knowledge of history and geography, a playground equipped with various equipment, and a kindergarten to act as a guardian for mothers..."</p>
<p>Indeed, this is enough to make us envy, excited, and moved. However, our country, like other countries, recognizes that children are the masters of the future world; recognizes that good character and habits must be developed from an early age. But the facts tell us that most of the masters of this future world have now become the dregs of mankind; everywhere we can see the footprints, tears, and scars of wandering children—some say they are the flowers of happiness.</p>
<p>Children's Day is here. The company has set up a beautiful "Paradise" for children. Let me, very impolitely, represent this group of countless homeless children and ask:</p>
<p>"Where is our Paradise?"</p>

<h3 id="e109">Shanghai's Children's Welfare Undertaking <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>——The Unfortunate Experiences of Children and the Glimmers of Hope for Their Welfare——</p>
<p>Originally, Shanghai's children could be said to be the happiest in the country; however, due to the impact of this "holy war," Shanghai's children can no longer be called happy. Children starving to death, freezing to death, and dying from illness are common sights. Suffering, homelessness, and wandering have become ordinary phenomena.</p>
<p>Recently, various circles in Shanghai have begun to pay some attention to the welfare of children. On Children's Day, everyone needs to know the current situation of children's welfare in Shanghai. Therefore, based on what is known, a brief overview is provided for reference. However, it is important for everyone to note that this does not mean that Shanghai's children have already entered a state of happiness. Of course, tragic facts still exist widely. However, even in this dismal fog, there is still a glimmer of light! It is hoped that everyone will muster the courage to move forward along this glimmer of light, so that in the near future, all children in Shanghai can universally step into the garden of happiness.</p>
<p>(1) Organizations Working for Children's Welfare</p>
<p>The Chinese Child Welfare Association</p>
<p>This association is organized by enthusiastic Chinese and foreign individuals concerned about child welfare issues. It was founded in 1928. The proclaimed purpose is "to promote, maintain, and protect the rights of Chinese children, and to seek happiness for children in every possible way." The current operations are divided into five groups: (1) Protection Group, protecting the rights of general children; (2) Relief Group, providing relief to helpless children; (3) Health Group, promoting children's health; (4) Research Group, promoting parental education and child training; (5) Propaganda Group, arousing public awareness of child welfare. (Editor's Note: See the previous month's issue of this publication for work details on the 27th.)</p>
<p>Shanghai Children's Welfare Association</p>
<p>This association was only established in mid-June last year. There are currently 35 directors, with Chen Heqin as the chairman of the board, and Chen Jicheng and Huang Dinghui as vice chairmen. Its organization is divided into four departments: (1) General Affairs Department, (2) Economic Department, (3) Affairs Department, (4) Editorial Department. The association's headquarters is located within Shanghai Women's University on Dagu Road.</p>
<p>The projects undertaken by the association include ten newsboy schools, educating more than 500 newsboys. Eleven more have now been added, bringing the total to twenty-one. They are currently preparing to establish a beggar children's training institute to house homeless children from the streets, which will open today. Following the beggar children's training institute, they will also organize a child labor rescue committee to improve the welfare of general child laborers. (Editor's Note: See the previous month's issue of this publication for work details on the 10th.)</p>
<p>(2) Children's Organization Research Group: Sixty-Six Children's Science Research Society</p>
<p>This society is organized by a group of children who love science and nature. It was established on June 6, 1935. The initial number of members was sixty-six, so it was named the Sixty-Six Children's Science Research Society. Their purpose is: "To satisfy children's desire for knowledge, to obtain the benefits of joint research, and to cultivate an interest in and habit of scientific research."</p>
<p>The society's organization is divided into three sections: books, research, and publication, with one president, one secretary, and one accountant. There are currently more than seventy members, all wearing a plum blossom-shaped "66" society badge. When joining the society, members must pay a joining fee of two dimes, and thereafter pay a regular fee of two dimes per person per semester. Any child who is interested in science and is between the ages of ten and sixteen can join.</p>
<p>Each semester, they convene all members for a general meeting to discuss the progress of society affairs. A research meeting is held once a month, sometimes stipulating a research center, or changing to a lecture, debate, field observation, experimental performance, essay contest, and other activities. A new issue of "Scientific Children" is published every Saturday, attached to the Children's Newspaper, as a forum for members to study each other and report their experiences.</p>
<p>New Children's Reading Club</p>
<p>The purpose of the association is: "To use spare time to study proper knowledge, to arouse interest in reading, to cultivate the habit of self-study, and to use this to connect feelings and promote love and sincerity." A general meeting of members is held once every two months, a meeting of association affairs is held once every half month, and an academic symposium is held once a week. The general meeting of members produces a president and vice president, and also establishes a secretariat, academic affairs department, membership department, supervision department, library, recreation, and publication positions to preside over all research matters.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Viewing Ran Xi's Personal Watercolor Painting Exhibition <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Camel</p>
<p>Art is a product of the times, and art changes with the times. The times move forward constantly, and art also moves forward with the times. If an art form solidifies and does not follow the progress of the times, then it shows the weakness of the art, and even the danger of extinction. Mr. Gao Qifeng once said, "Painting is not a dead thing, but a living and changeable thing. Each era has its own spirit, characteristics, and experiences. A painter is not only seeking fame, nor is he only comforting himself. He should have the feeling that the hunger and drowning of the world are his own hunger and drowning, and have the concept of achieving oneself and others, and strive to sacrifice interests and clarify the new spirit of the Ming Dynasty." This also illustrates the inseparable relationship between art and the times.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, China has had a new enlightenment movement in the cultural field. Because China's War of Resistance is not only resisting crazy invaders, but also building a new China and a new Chinese culture. Painting, as one of the cultural departments, certainly has an important task. Unfortunately, the Chinese painting world has not grasped this great era. This is so lonely and solitary, I lament the desolation of the Chinese painting scene. But in Shanghai this year, when the swallows returned, I saw the solo exhibition of watercolor painter Ran Xi, just like the sunshine in spring, giving my heart a warm nourishment.</p>
<p>This solo exhibition has a total of more than sixty works, displayed in the Sino-French Friendship Association at the intersection of Route Massenet. All are refined works. Watercolor painters have a common problem: either their technique is too unskilled, or they lack emotion. Ran Xi's paintings do not have this problem. His technique has reached a refined state, and his expressiveness is rapid and passionate; passion is the life of an artist. If an artist has no passion, not only will the picture present a gray scene, but the impact on society will also be a gray life. But every one of Ran Xi's paintings is full of vitality and vigor. The red tones bathe in the fresh sunshine, writing about those pedestrians, streets, trees, and houses, and making them come alive and rich at an accelerated pace, as if being in the countryside in spring. This kind of vibrant work symbolizes the new China, and the new China also needs this kind of thriving art.</p>
<p>Ran Xi's watercolor paintings like to use a strong contrast in composition. For example, the sky is left very high, and the houses and ground are painted very small. Thus, in that high sky, one can see some rapidly moving clouds, and the brushstrokes are very smooth and vigorous. The appropriate coordination of light is especially a characteristic of Ran Xi's paintings.</p>
<p>A successful artist relies on talent and effort. Ran Xi has considerable talent and I hope he continues to work hard.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Young Swallows and Orioles Reflect Double Perfections, Yue Luo and Wu Brocade Looms Weave Seven Funerals</p>
<p>In the past, when sending express letters at the post office, there were many categories within express mail. There were ordinary express, special express, air express, and many other distinctions. Of course, air express was the fastest. Air express was airmail express, but it was limited to a few major cities in the country that could be reached by air, and the fees were also very expensive. As for non-air express mail, it was often very slow, not much different from ordinary mail. As soon as there was an obstruction, especially fast became especially slow. This cannot be blamed on the postal authorities, as they were also helpless. But now it is different. All express mail is delivered by plane. There is no need to use the name air express, and it is all sent by air. There are several reasons for this: first, domestic airlines are well-connected. Not to mention domestic ones, which international airline company is not connected to China, whether in Europe or America? Second, the Chinese post office itself has several air routes, and its own special planes dedicated to sending express mail, which have recently been expanding. Third, personnel matters are complicated, and time is increasingly sought after for economy. Without a quick method, it is impossible. Now that there is a quick method, why would they still stick to the old method? For example, those who are used to taking cars and trains are still willing to take the former oxcarts and mule carts? Because there are more and more airplanes for aviation, of course there are also more and more airports. Airports are everywhere throughout China. But places like Anle Town and other market towns do not have airports. Presumably, the post office has an aviation network. Whichever bureau is closest to which airport will send it to that airport. There are also some places where it is not necessary to stop the plane, but there are quite a few letters. They have prepared a kind of letter parachute, put the letters into the parachute, and throw it off the plane. There are also people waiting there below, catching the letter parachute and delivering them separately. In short, for the sake of convenience of letters, there are new and wonderful methods that are difficult to describe. With the method of aviation delivery of letters, it has truly achieved morning departure and evening arrival. Just like an express letter sent from Anle Town to Beiping, handed over to the post office overnight, it can arrive in Beiping tomorrow afternoon. This letter is probably still from Anle Town to Shanghai, and Shanghai flies directly to Beiping. However, according to the time distribution, the time from Anle Town to Shanghai is more than double the time from Shanghai to Beiping. There is also the transfer from small airplanes to large airplanes. Similar to large airships going abroad that want to fly over the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean, carrying hundreds of passengers and transporting tons of cargo. Therefore, in order to seek its speed, the small airports in each city will carry passengers to the large airports and attach to large airships, just like in the past, small steamboats were used to transport passengers to large ships in front of the Bund.

<p>Intelligent Children are the Crystallization of Love</p>
<p>Children are truly living treasures. They are the continuers of their parents' lives, the inheritors of the family, the future pillars of society, and the future masters of the nation. Their responsibilities are so great, and their future is so bright. So it is no wonder that parents call their children, the crystallization of their love, "baby" and "treasure."</p>
<p>Today is Children's Memorial Day, April 4th. Schools are closed for vacation, and companies and businesses are offering special discounts on children's goods or opening up children's playgrounds to entertain children. Various organizations and groups are holding memorial meetings, lectures, and recreational activities. In short, today the entire world is enthusiastically celebrating this Children's Day. This is so solemn and meaningful! However, on this Children's Day, we offer sincere advice to young couples in general: that children must be the crystallization of marital love. This is because, according to eugenics and medical judgment, a energetic and healthy man and a beautiful woman will certainly have intense love, organize a happy family with joy and happiness, and give birth to intelligent children. These children, the crystallization of love, will certainly be intelligent, lively, healthy, and beautiful, truly a living treasure like a little angel. At the same time, because of the connection of this crystallization of love between the couple, their love will certainly be particularly strong, and their marital life will certainly be fulfilling and happy. This is such happiness! However, if a man has committed self-indulgence and nocturnal emission in his early years, or has been dissolute and indulgent after marriage, resulting in weakened innate functions, breaking out with spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, thin sperm and infertility, incomplete development, neurasthenia, and other symptoms, then the couple's life will not be satisfactory, or even completely unable to perform the marital act. Then the couple's relationship is nominal, their love is weak, their youthful happiness is lost, and the children they give birth to are mostly weak and sickly, with a particularly high mortality rate, or even unable to conceive, leaving a lifelong regret!</p>
<p>According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, the only remedy for the above symptoms is to take the gonadotropin preparation "Shengzhisu," which is the most effective and symptomatic. It can produce sperm and replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood, and nourish nerves in one day and night after taking it. Once taken, it can completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and can achieve the effect of prolonging life, rejuvenating youth, and reversing aging. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Ximitoushi Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gate and stop leakage, so that the effect is even faster. It is true that with a healthy body, on this Children's Day, I wish you both greater love and early birth of good children.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Breasts and Spring Outings <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Spring is truly the season for women to be active. Although it has been raining and windy these past few days, and the weather seems a bit cold, precisely because it has been a bit cold, once the weather clears up, the myriad flowers in the park bloom in competition, making the spring even more vibrant! At this time, many women on spring outings are wearing thin spring clothes, revealing snow-lotus-like pink arms and willow-like slender waists. They are even matched with a pair of towering and attractive breasts, fluttering gracefully in front of their chests. Their cheeks are filled with charming smiles, and they are with affectionate companions, either standing beside the pavilion, watching pairs of butterflies, whispering sweet nothings, or leaning against the waterside pavilion, listening to the chirping of birds, singing a soft song. Their faces are as delicate as peach blossoms, their singing is as crisp as the sound of orioles, leaning on each other, their feelings are intertwined. What a wonderful and happy picture that is!</p>
<p>But women who have lost their beauty and health are not blessed to participate in such a beautiful and happy picture. Think about it, can a woman who has lost her beauty and health still have towering breasts? Can her arms still be plump? Can her complexion still be as delicate as peach blossoms? It is undoubtedly impossible! Because it is impossible for them, they only have sallow faces, flat breasts, and thin arms. Even if they wear new clothes, they cannot hide their ugliness. Such women are not only disliked by others, and no one takes their arms and whispers sweet nothings with them in the park, but even when they look at themselves in the mirror, they feel endless regret! But what's the use of regret? If you understand the cause of the loss of beauty and health, and actively take the ovarian preparation "Shengzhisu" for women, then there is still time. This preparation is finely formulated, whether you are suffering from irregular menstruation, postpartum weakness, leukorrhea, dysmenorrhea, or failure to recuperate after illness, it can cure them for you one by one in the shortest possible time. If you continue to take it, it can not only make your breasts tower high, but also make you younger and more youthful. It can make your cheeks rosy, and increase your beauty.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Untreated Spermatorrhea is Enough to Shorten One's Life <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>Dreams, these two words are so poetic! But dreams during the spring love arousal period are lurking with danger. When sweet dreams linger in the "land of sweet sleep," some are awakened by laughter, because they feel the illusion of the dream and recall the sweetness of the dream, which leads to masturbation. Furthermore, masturbation becomes a habit, resulting in loss of sperm control, followed by nocturnal emission. It is also common for the lingering of dreams to cause sexual stimulation and suddenly cause nocturnal emission. In short, dreams during the spring love arousal period are more bad than good.</p>
<p>Once a young man has masturbation and nocturnal emission, he should realize it, purify his heart, reduce his desires, repent of his past mistakes, and if the nocturnal emission does not stop, he should seek medical advice and take medicine as soon as possible for diagnosis and treatment. Do not ignore it. If you do not take it seriously and allow the symptoms to worsen, you will end up with exhausted sperm and blood, resulting in kidney deficiency and incompetence, local shortness, scattered energy, prolonged infertility, neurasthenia, and other symptoms. Then you will be trapped in pain all day long, not only will there be no hope for academic and career prospects! Even in the marital life that is indispensable in life, it will not be possible to coordinate emotions and live a fulfilling life, and your wife will hate you, and all kinds of tragedies will be staged in the family! At the same time, in the man himself, because of the pain and sorrow, he will age prematurely or even die young!</p>
<p>The most effective treatment for nocturnal emission at this time is to take "Ximitoushi Sperm-Consolidating Tablets," which can consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, reduce dreams, and ensure peaceful sleep all night long. Nocturnal emission can be completely eradicated. If the above symptoms have already been caused by nocturnal emission, you must also take the gonadotropin preparation "Shengzhisu" to increase sperm and blood, nourish the brain and kidneys, and nourish the nerves. If you continue to take it, you can completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and can achieve the benefits of prolonging life, rejuvenating youth, and reversing aging.</p>

<p>No Worries About Infertility</p>
<p>Because leukorrhea causes patients to lose their ability to reproduce, gonorrhea accounts for the highest rate in infertility statistics. Among these gonorrhea-related infertility cases, epididymitis accounts for the majority. Therefore, gonorrhea patients are most afraid of epididymitis. Examining the structure of the epididymis, it contains about twenty tubules that are integrated. Their function is to transport the sperm that has been produced in the testicles. Unfortunately, if epididymitis occurs, it hinders the work of transporting sperm, thus losing the conditions for pregnancy. In addition, because the testicles are the tools for producing sperm, if orchitis occurs, it is indeed a major threat to reproduction. However, if the testicles have not become hardened, there is still a way to save them.</p>
<p>The only way to prevent orchitis and infertility is to use a rapid method to eliminate the inflammation, so that the tubules that are about to close can restore their normal physiological state due to the subsidence of the inflammation. In this way, it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep has been lost. When the orchitis is swollen and drooping, the patient must be instructed to rest, and a specially made testicle suspension should be used to support the drooping scrotum. German Hess serum is also injected to resist gonorrhea, reduce inflammation, and reduce swelling. On the one hand, German Filtered Lymph Flow Electrotherapy is used to directly extinguish gonococci. In this way, within two or three weeks, the symptoms of orchitis can be reduced by sixty to seventy percent, and in five weeks, the inflammation can be completely cured. All pathological conditions can be quickly extinguished. If it is confirmed that it has been cured, the semen should be checked multiple times. If pure sperm can be detected without mixing with other impurities, it can prove that this gonorrhea-related infertility can still return to life like millet in the valley and restore the function of reproduction. This is my practical experience over the past ten years. Many patients who have suffered from gonorrhea-related infertility for many years have been cured by me, and they have all had satisfactory results!</p>

<h3 id="e117">The Importance Attached to Children's Films in Various Countries <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>—Written on Children's Day</p>
<p>Film has been recognized as a fast-track tool for assisting children's education, so countries around the world currently attach great importance to children's films. Today is Children's Day, so I want to briefly report to readers the situation of various countries attaching importance to children's films.</p>
<p>United States The United States is an advanced country in the film industry, so film education in the United States is more advanced than in any other country. Many schools in the United States have now purchased projectors and screen children's films every Sunday or holiday. Some of these films are specially produced by public institutions collecting materials and writing scripts, while others are produced by film companies specifically for schools or educational institutions to screen. Even ordinary cinemas show films with educational significance for children, and the ticket prices are reduced very cheaply for children to watch.</p>
<p>England In tradition, the old England, which has some conservative colors in everything, is of course no exception to film, especially for children's films, special attention is paid. When film censorship committees in various places check films, every film must be labeled with the letter A or U. The letter A is an abbreviation of Aduii, which means that only adults are allowed to watch and children are not allowed. The letter U is an abbreviation of Universal, which means that adults and children can watch it. In recent years, the United Kingdom has even set up a national organization to manage children's films, shooting children's films and screening them publicly in public institutions or schools in various places.</p>
<p>Germany The two dictatorial countries of Germany and Italy also attach importance to children's films, but since the rise of fascism, these two countries have successively unified the film industry, using film as a tool for propaganda, with political function more important than entertainment. Therefore, children's films are no exception. Public institutions select materials for children's films, shoot films, some of which are obvious and some of which are suggestive, to promote fascism and national socialism to children. And cinemas and schools often have public screenings of these children's films.</p>
<p>Soviet Union The progress of the Soviet film industry is particularly rapid, prompting anyone to express surprise. Especially for film education, they pay great attention. In Moscow alone, on every holiday, there are more than 500 cinemas, from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm, screening children's films in rotation. The ticket prices are low, which is unseen in other countries. These films, including feature films and cartoons, are produced by the government and are specifically for children aged 8 to 16 to watch. In terms of production, the stories are all targeted at children, which is different from ordinary films.</p>
<p>China Finally, what I want to say is that our Chinese Central Film Censorship Committee does not have a label indicating whether a film is suitable for children to watch, and the country does not have laws prohibiting children from watching certain types of films. However, in recent years, we have also paid great attention to film education. In Shanghai alone, the Chinese Film Education Association has a branch in Shanghai, and often screens specially produced or selected children's films in various primary and secondary schools for free in rotation. It's just that after August 13th, this organization also withdrew with the national army, and temporarily left.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Communicating Chinese and Foreign Cultures: Performance of the Famous French Play "Carmen" (Part 2) by the Eurasia Theater Company at the Lyceum Theatre <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Du</p>
<p>Introduction to the Script</p>
<p>The author of (Carmen), George Bizet, was born in Paris, France, in 1838. His first opera, Docteur Bliracle, was published in 1857, but it was not until (Carmen) was highly recommended by the great writer Nietzsche that it gained recognition in the art world. The story of this play tells of a young French soldier who falls in love with a Gypsy girl and becomes a thief. However, Carmen is also attracted to the bravery and strength of the bullfighter and discovers the soldier's weakness and mediocrity, leading to a change of heart. In a fit of jealousy, the soldier kills Carmen, ending this tragic love triangle.</p>
<p>The entire play consists of four acts. In addition to depicting a Spanish story, the author also portrays the lives of Gypsies engaged in smuggling and the wandering existence of local ruffians. It possesses the magnificent spirit of Shakespeare's (Romeo and Juliet), especially its delicate and warm atmosphere. However, unlike Shakespeare, who uses the ultimate love between a man and a woman to resolve human hatred, (Carmen) uses a symbol of strength to illustrate the triumph of love.</p>
<p>In the feudal or bourgeois society in men's hearts, especially in France, this play, for those who passionately and unrestrainedly attempt love, (Carmen) will inevitably be a popular drama. However, in (this time) and (this place) Shanghai, (Carmen) does not seem to evoke much interest among Chinese audiences. Firstly, due to national differences, and secondly, due to the particularly volatile art of the times, even operas, which are considered weak, fail to convey their themes as effectively as ( ). Even Chinese local operas are already on the path to decline.</p>
<p>Impressions of the Performance</p>
<p>The performance's achievements were not expected to be overly extravagant, but at least that is my personal impression.</p>
<p>Firstly, apart from Habanera and Toreoder in the second act, which were somewhat listenable, the orchestra conductor, Maestro E. Marcus, did not fulfill his full potential. The soaring and progressive emotions were never naturally grasped, and only some success was achieved in the Feeling interludes. Secondly, the singing technique was insufficient. Several actors, such as M. Speransky (the bullfighter) and G. Sayapin (the army captain), had hoarse voices, which harmed the main conditions for the opera's success and aroused a feeling of disgust. Thirdly, the actors' acting skills were not clearly developed here. Especially the director, his handling of the entire play, except for the crowded scenes in the hotel in the second act and the Gypsy dance scene, was quite commendable. However, scenes like the conviction and imprisonment in the first act and the captain's arrest were not clearly depicted. Furthermore, the scene where Tao Cai tries to assassinate the bullfighter Escamillo lacked even the minimum level of embellishment. I feel that handling a four-hour-long stage play is not easy, especially the difficulties of opera. Under the direction of Mr. S. Ulianov, the entire play felt disorganized and lacked harmony in terms of light, sound, and art. If I didn't put it this way, then a Chinese audience watching a French opera performed by Russians must feel alienated by the two distinct and indelible ancestral divides!</p>

<h3 id="e119">Red Bean Studio Sponsors Orphan Kunqu Opera Class <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Lan</p>
<p>Previously, I attended a banquet at the Queen's Theatre, held at the Tiantian Restaurant on Guangxi Road. Many editors and colleagues from the press were present. During the banquet, I spoke with Yi Fangshuo, a famous Shanghai comedian, about the orphan school. Among them, there were some children who were learning Kunqu Opera. I hereby record it as follows.</p>
<p>Since the August 13th Incident, there have been many orphans in Shanghai who have lost their homes after being affected by the disaster. Their situation of eating in the wind and sleeping in the open air is extremely miserable. Since these children are the future masters of China, it is unbearable for kind-hearted people to let them suffer from hunger and cold. Therefore, many charitable figures in Shanghai raised funds to establish this orphan school. In the beginning, it was only for the purpose of providing shelter. Later, they provided education and guidance according to their talents, so that they could each find employment and support themselves. Currently, there are some simple industrial manufacturing practices in place, and the products are quite good. However, this is not the subject of this article, so I will omit it for now. Among them, there are some children whose nature is close to drama, so Pu Xiyuan (also known as Pu Dong, also known as Red Bean Studio Master), a famous Kunqu Opera amateur who loves Kunqu Opera, trains them. There are a total of forty people in the class, including sheng, dan, jing, and chou roles, all taught according to their talents, so that they can achieve success. Although it has only been a few months, the results are already quite impressive. In the future, it should not be difficult to add a different color to China's inherent art, which is about to become a fading echo, and to reverse the tide. At the same time, assisting the Red Bean Studio Master are two famous teachers who taught the Xian Ni Society's family troupe in the past. They guide the students diligently every day, sparing no effort, which is also a fortunate thing for the students. According to Mr. Fangshuo, he himself is also one of the sponsors of the school. He heard from the charitable figures in charge of the school that they will further establish beggar schools and newsboy schools in the future, in order to ensure that no talent is wasted and no one is neglected. Among them, newsboys are particularly easy to train, because most newsboys are literate to some extent and can understand ordinary text at a glance. Therefore, it should be relatively easy to start with training. It is also learned that the Municipal Council is willing to provide considerable support for such charitable undertakings (as reported in various newspapers on the 27th of last month). Therefore, everything in the future will be easier to carry out. The reporter wishes to offer sincere prayers for the orphans, beggars, and newsboys, in the hope that they will succeed.</p>
<h3 id="e120">A Weak Woman's Confession <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Sent by Jin Suqin from Hong Kong</p>
<p>Like a bolt from the blue, a warm-hearted friend suddenly sent me many newspaper articles about me from Shanghai, which really left me speechless, dumbfounded, and not knowing whether to laugh or cry. After the August 13th Incident, I was hated and despised by a certain class. Almost every time they saw my name, they would quickly spit on the ground. But at the same time, I made many friends who had always been indifferent to me. I only attribute the former to differences in opinion, and I would never dare to harbor any feelings of animosity. The latter's enthusiastic encouragement gave me a great sense of comfort, which I will always remember and never forget. To say that I, upon leaving Shanghai, would recklessly and indiscriminately satirize my friends in Shanghai for no reason, I think that any friend who knows me a little would not believe that I am so confused, muddleheaded, and unreasonable!</p>
<p>If the editor allows me a chance to confess, I would like to tell the truth. On the second day of my arrival in Hong Kong, I was honored by the kindness of Mr. Liu Qingxuan, Wang Xiaolai, Mao Heyuan, Ruan Weiyang, Hu Hao, and others, who held a tea party for me at the Hong Kong Hotel. The first to speak at the party were Mr. Ruan and Mr. Ouyang. Neither of them said a word about the situation in Shanghai. And when it came to my reply, there were only five short sentences:</p>
<p>"This time, Suqin came to Hong Kong from the isolated island, and what I have done is just a little bit of duty. Today, I am very grateful for the host's hospitality." (See the original text in the newspaper)</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Chen Xiaowei, and Gu Wuwei also gave speeches, but there were no words that stimulated friends in Shanghai. I really don't understand where the reporter who wrote that article got the idea to fabricate such a grand theory for me out of thin air? Although if you want to condemn someone, you can always find a charge, but attacking people should also be based on true and reliable evidence, so that people will be convinced.</p>
<p>I am now attaching a page from a Hong Kong newspaper, and if you could kindly print it to clarify the truth and slightly appease the anger of my friends in Shanghai, then this weak woman would be truly grateful.</p>
<p>The original words recorded by the Hong Kong newspaper can be used as proof.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Thirteenth Sister's Filial Piety and Nian Gengyao's Respect for His Teacher</p>
<p>It is said that once he was sitting in a green felt sedan chair during a snowstorm. Suddenly, he felt a pang of compassion and ordered the two guards holding the sedan chair poles to "release their hands." Unexpectedly, the two men simultaneously drew their swords and chopped off the hand that was holding the pole. When he saw this, he realized that his command was too strict. His original intention was because the weather that day was too cold. He himself was sitting in a sedan chair lined with tiger skin cushions, wearing heavy fur clothes, and still felt the cold seeping in. When he looked outside, the two guards holding the sedan chair poles each had one hand exposed to the outside. After being blown by the cold wind, wouldn't they be frozen? Therefore, he had a kind thought and broke the record by issuing a "release your hands" command. In the autocratic era, the majesty of the general was truly extraordinary. He couldn't speak like ordinary people, such as saying, "You two, put down the hand that is holding the sedan chair pole," or saying with great emotion, "It's too cold today, the snow is falling so heavily, and the wind is blowing so hard. Don't you feel cold? If not, put your hands down." It seemed that all these lengthy speeches were not what people in the officialdom should say. People often say "official style," and official style is command-style. A sentence can only use three or two words. General Nian had always been a person who killed without batting an eye. None of his subordinates had ever seen him show kindness. Today, when he told them to release their hands, they never dreamed that he was telling them to take their hands away or move them away. Therefore, in addition to chopping off their wrists to accept the general's order, what other method of delay was there for them to consider? Moreover, military orders are like mountains. A slight hesitation would result in a charge of disobeying orders. If that were the case, how could they protect their heads?</p>
<p>Once, Yongzheng was reviewing troops. Because it was the height of summer and the sun was scorching, the training time was too long, and many soldiers fainted on the ground. Yongzheng then issued an imperial decree to stop the training, but the generals continued to train as usual because they had not received an order from General Nian. Later, Nian Gengyao simply waved the command flag, and the troops dispersed in an instant. Yongzheng thought, my imperial decree is not as effective as his command flag. If Nian Gengyao rebelled in the future, with military power in his hands, it would be impossible to subdue him. Therefore, within a few years, he had General Nian, who had been famous for a time and had shaken the border areas, put to death. (This happened in the third year of Yongzheng's reign.) Thirteenth Sister still felt a great regret for not being able to personally kill the enemy who killed her father.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Pharmacy Creed <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>—Attention New Drug Industry—</p>
<p>"Genuine Goods at Fair Prices, Honesty with the Elderly and Children" This eight-character phrase is sufficient to encompass commercial ethics. The profession of pharmacy is different from other professions because, in addition to customers and colleagues, there is also the object of the doctor, and in the process of manufacturing, dispensing, and selling, there is actually a hidden crisis of human life. This is the creed that the pharmacy industry should abide by, so it cannot be completely encompassed by ordinary commercial ethics. After quietly observing, I deeply know where the shortcomings of the domestic pharmaceutical industry lie. If we do not prescribe the right medicine and correct them, we cannot improve the status of the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, I propose a creed as a criticism. To know and not speak is called concealment, to speak without justification is called recklessness. The above is what I have proposed and is free from these two extremes! Fellow pharmacists, please do not treat it as mere talk and dismiss it.</p>
<p>(1) Do not manufacture fake or inferior drugs</p>
<p>(2) Do not sell enemy goods</p>
<p>(3) Do not secretly sell prohibited drugs and equipment without a doctor's prescription</p>
<p>(4) Do not entice doctors with commissions</p>
<p>(5) Do not arbitrarily criticize doctors' prescriptions in front of patients</p>
<p>(6) Do not arbitrarily change doctors' prescriptions privately. If there is an error in the doctor's prescription, you should try to notify the doctor to correct it.</p>
<p>(7) Do not exercise the functions of a doctor and secretly prescribe and dispense medication</p>
<p>(8) Do not disclose the secrets of the medical and pharmaceutical industries</p>

<h3 id="e124">Treatment for Pufferfish Roe Poisoning <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Zanseng</p>
<p>Reading a news item on the fourth page of a certain newspaper on the 11th of this month about pufferfish roe poisoning, a coolie obtained a fish, and eight people shared it. Two people had already died, and the remaining six were still being treated. In order to increase public health knowledge, I will briefly describe the morphology of the pufferfish, its poisoning phenomenon, and methods of prevention:</p>
<p>(1) Morphology of Pufferfish: Pufferfish belong to the carp family. Carp have round bodies and small heads. Scales are of varying sizes. They have dorsal fins. The lower part of the head has a thick, hard horny plate. The mouth has powerful molars on the lower jawbone but no other teeth. The edges of the mouth of this type of fish generally have barbels. They live in freshwater and eat small animals, rarely eating plants. Common in East Asia are Cyprinus carpio, with four barbels on the upper edge of the mouth, and Barbus vulgaris, which also has four barbels, two of which grow at the tip of the mouth. The spawning period is between March and May.</p>
<p>(2) Symptoms and Causes of Pufferfish Roe Poisoning: Pufferfish roe poisoning occurs throughout Europe and Asia. Often, many people are poisoned and die at the same time. The reason is eating pufferfish eggs. The symptoms of poisoning are called "Pufferfish Cholera" (Barbencholera) because the disease is similar to cholera. The main symptoms are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Mild cases can be treated, while severe cases often lead to death. In the late 18th century, from 1885 to 1892, the Japanese health authorities announced that the number of deaths from fish poisoning reached 933, of which 681 died. In other words, the number of deaths accounted for 73% of the number of poisoning cases. The most toxic period for fish eggs is when they are about to lay eggs, from March to May. Dr. Tahara discovered that these fish eggs contain toxins, namely Tetrodonin and Tetrodonin acid.</p>
<p>Treatment: Similar to acute gastroenteritis, eat and drink less. Use castor oil as a laxative. For severe cases, use cardiac stimulants and physiological saline infusion. Avoid using antidiarrheal drugs!</p>

<p>— Zhuang Weizhong</p>
<p>Doctors use many methods to diagnose gastritis patients. I will briefly describe them to provide some common sense knowledge. Whether the patient has acute or chronic gastritis, doctors examine the medical history in great detail. Patients should provide as much information as possible and listen to the doctor's questions. The medical history contains a lot of reference information for diagnosis. In addition, the vomitus of acute gastritis patients should be kept for the doctor to examine. Also, chronic gastritis patients, even if they do not vomit, may have their stomach contents removed by a stomach tube for examination (there is no great suffering). In clinical practice, the gastric juice of chronic gastritis patients often shows abnormal gastric acid secretion, either decreased or increased, and contains a large amount of mucus. How can this be guessed without examination? Other things like the statement of current symptoms, detailed but concise, should be appropriate. Everything the doctor asks should be answered in detail, with no concealment or exaggeration. All of the above should be common sense for those seeking medical treatment for stomach problems, not just those with gastritis.</p>
<p>As for the prognosis of gastritis patients, although it cannot be certain, it has less direct relationship with life. Acute gastritis, if treated reasonably immediately and following the laws of health, can recover early. Otherwise, it will be prolonged and difficult to cure, and easily turn into chronic gastritis. Among them, toxic gastritis affects not only a local part of the stomach, and the anatomical changes of the stomach are severe. If toxic substances are absorbed, there is a danger to life. Chronic gastritis occurs intermittently and heals repeatedly, complaining of indigestion, anorexia, or a liking for food, but only a small taste is taken. As a result, nutrition is greatly affected, the body becomes thin, and the spirit is unhappy. Therefore, many people suffer from neurasthenia (and neurasthenia patients often have chronic gastritis combined. These two diseases seem to have a chain relationship between them). As a result, body weight is reduced, natural disease resistance is weakened, and other diseases are easily contracted. Sometimes, other stomach diseases continue to occur (such as cancer, or it is originally cancer, and the initial symptoms are not obvious and are regarded as chronic gastritis).</p>
<p>Finally, I will describe the treatment of gastritis (but it must be stated that this is only to show the general outline of the treatment, so that readers can have more common sense about the treatment of gastritis. It is not intended for people to seek self-treatment by following the instructions blindly. Moreover, this kind of disease also needs to be considered at any time in the treatment, and there is no fixed method). For acute gastritis, the first treatment is to remove the cause, preferably washing the stomach with warm water. Stomach washing should be done with a rubber stomach tube. The liquid used for stomach washing can be baking soda water, or plain water (boiled), or saline, or other medicinal liquids, depending on the symptoms. In case of poisoning (food poisoning, chemical poisoning, etc.), appropriate antidote should be used to neutralize it. However, in the case of acid and alkali poisoning, stomach washing and emetics are prohibited to avoid stomach perforation. At the same time, a laxative should be used (which is forbidden in case of acid and alkali poisoning) to facilitate defecation and indirectly reduce stomach inflammation. After the acute symptoms are removed, ordinary mild stomachics can be used. For stomach pain, heat compresses can be used, or hot salt bags can be used for ironing. Anesthetics should not be used unless absolutely necessary. If vomiting is not severe, it can be left alone. If vomiting does not stop, consider using antiemetics. If the fever is high, consider using antipyretics that do not hinder digestion. However, fever in acute gastritis often goes away with other symptoms. Just remove the contents and think about the cause. If the fever is not very high, there is no need to worry too much. During treatment, starvation should be maintained for two or three days, during which only drink a lot of water every day.</p>
<p>The treatment of chronic gastritis is more difficult than that of acute gastritis. First, remove the causative causes. Second, oral hygiene is the most important and should be maintained by gargling from time to time (as in acute gastritis). Third, pay attention to the improvement of diet, with those that are nutritious and easy to digest being the most suitable. Change the taste from time to time to stimulate appetite. Each intake should be small rather than large, and the number of meals can be increased several times. If the condition worsens, try washing the stomach with 0.3% baking soda water, but it should not be done for too long. If the condition improves, drink a large cup of warm salt water half an hour before meals. Other things like appropriate exercise and fresh air are also important.</p>

<h3 id="e126">The Experience of Diagnosing and Treating Pneumonia with Diphtheria Complications <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Zhenyu</p>
<p>Introduction: Although I have encountered several cases of pneumonia complicated by diphtheria, none were as dangerous as this one, nor did any respond as readily to treatment. The reason for this is that we now have new medicines that are beneficial tools in treating diseases. Therefore, I am describing it below for research purposes.</p>
<p>Case History: The patient is a male child, four years old this year, which is actually three years and seven months old. According to his father, on February 8th, the child seemed unwell, didn't like to play, and preferred to sleep. His parents thought he had caught a slight cold and that rest and a restricted diet would suffice. In the middle of the night, they felt his body was burning hot, realizing it was not a cold but an illness. The next morning (February 9th), they took him to see a certain traditional Chinese doctor. The doctor said that evil fire had invaded, and this was one of the winter plagues. Prescribing dispelling evil and reducing fire medicine would cure him. After taking the Chinese medicine, they expected it would lessen the next day (February 10th), but unexpectedly, the illness seemed more severe. So, they took him back to the doctor, who repeated his previous diagnosis, slightly modified the prescription, and instructed them to decoct and administer it. After following the instructions, the illness did not improve but rather worsened. He was in a deep sleep and didn't speak, only occasionally startled, and his breathing was short. The family had recently lost their grandfather, and since the child wasn't noisy, they didn't pay close attention. The next day (February 11th), he still took one dose of Chinese medicine. In the evening, his sleep was restless, and his breathing was even shorter, often gasping for air. His face was pale. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 12th, they went back for a follow-up visit. After modifying the prescription and decocting it, it seemed that there was phlegm rattling up and down in his airways. The frequency of gasping for air seemed to increase. Seeing phlegm in his throat, they thought the medicine was working effectively, and the illness would be cured once the phlegm was expelled. He became even more restless at night, not sleeping for a moment. The next day (February 13th), he took another dose of Chinese medicine, which was specifically for digesting stagnant phlegm, thinking that once the phlegm was gone, his breathing would be smooth. However, the child's spirit became even more listless, his face was even paler, and the frequency of gasping for air increased even more, with his breathing becoming more rapid and shallow. Around 6 or 7 p.m., his breathing sound was loud, as if a mass of phlegm was blocking his airway. The next day (February 14th), they went back for a follow-up visit. The doctor said: "Phlegm is stagnating in the trachea. Once the phlegm is transformed, the illness will be cured, without a doubt. We should quickly use phlegm-resolving medications." So, they decocted and administered another dose according to the prescription. Unexpectedly, his breathing sound became even louder, with a rattling sound constantly audible, and even louder. The frequency of gasping for air increased again, his face became even paler, and he felt pain in the lower left chest, abdominal pain, and a headache. By 10 p.m., he was gasping for air every three to four minutes, sometimes unable to catch his breath. He clenched his hands tightly, straightened his chest, and took a deep breath, which seemed to calm him down a bit. By 12 p.m., his condition worsened, so they telegraphed, requesting that I examine him.</p>
<p>Examination Process: I arrived at 12:15 a.m., which should be considered the morning of the 15th. Visual examination: The child was physically strong, with a pale face, and a deep illness. He was not very thin. His lips were purplish-blue, indicating a state of suffocation. He was gasping for air, about once every two minutes. Every three to five gasps, there was one forced respiration. When performing this respiration, his hands would clench, his chest would straighten, his mouth would open, and the rattling sound was quite loud. Breathing seemed very difficult and quite shallow. His nostrils flared constantly. His parents firmly believed it was caused by phlegm, so they requested surgery to remove the phlegm to ease his breathing. I replied that I would examine him first and then discuss it further. His rectal temperature was 10S.S°F. His respiration, counted by chest and abdominal movement, was 50, and his pulse was 145, very weak.</p>
<p>Percussion: The upper right lung, up to the upper edge of the fourth rib, had a mixed sound of solidity and emptiness. The upper left lung, up to the upper edge of the third rib, had a solid sound.</p>
<p>Auscultation: In the diseased area of the right lung, I heard amphoric and bronchovesicular sounds. In the diseased area of the left lung, I heard crackles and increased breath sounds. From this, it appears that the right lung showed signs of the second stage, and the left lung showed signs of the first stage. At the same time, the child complained of pain in the lower left chest, abdominal pain, and a headache. Except for the area near the affected region, where the breathing sound was slightly louder, the rest showed normal signs. Combining the results of the examination, it was undoubtedly lobar pneumonia, starting in the right lung and then spreading to the left lung. However, his breathing had a rattling sound, clearly indicating that there was a foreign object in the airway. At a time when diphtheria was prevalent, I suspected it was diphtheria causing the trouble. But upon examining his throat, I only saw enlarged and inflamed tonsils, with no other special abnormalities. The child was crying and fussing a lot, making it difficult to examine deeper areas. Therefore, I reluctantly used a mouth gag to open his mouth. I then discovered a large patch of pseudo-membrane on the back of the left tonsil, blackish-gray in color, suitable for becoming a bellows-like valve. There was also a patch of pseudo-membrane behind the right tonsil, but it was smaller and whiter. I immediately took a small amount of mucus and sent it to the pathology laboratory for testing. In the afternoon, I received the report confirming it was diphtheria. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Suo Fei</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>The night is deep and silent.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Mrs. Gu woke up from her sleep and nudged Mr. Gu, who was sleeping beside her, gently calling:</p>
<p>"Lao Gu! Lao Gu!"</p>
<p>Mr. Gu was having a sweet dream. He dreamt that he was with his beloved wife, touring West Lake. It was a Mid-Autumn Festival night, a round, crystal-clear bright moon hung high in the still night sky, and one or two white clouds slowly drifted by, like happy boats swaying in the happy sea of the sky. This beautiful scene was reflected in the waters of West Lake, making the lake even more beautiful. He and his beloved wife were sitting in a small pleasure boat, the thin oars gently paddling the lake water, and the boat slowly glided across the surface. It was late at night, and the yachts on the lake were already sparse, with only two or three scattered about. It seemed as if they were competing with the white clouds of the sea of the sky, making the scenery even more beautiful.</p>
<p>The boat gradually approached Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, and suddenly three round bright moons appeared on the surface of the lake. Together with the one in the sky and the one at the bottom of the water, these five bright moons formed a rare and spectacular sight. This beautiful and serene scene intoxicated Mr. Gu and Mrs. Gu. They stopped rowing and nestled close together, their wise eyes sharing the same view, silently admiring the autumn night on West Lake.</p>
<p>"Lao Gu! Lao Gu!" The beloved call of his wife rang in Mr. Gu's ears.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Mr. Gu responded enthusiastically, turned to look at his beloved wife, and their affectionate faces touched, feeling warm as if a fire was burning there.</p>
<p>This feeling of warmth suddenly made Mr. Gu realize that they were not in the beautiful West Lake, but sleeping in a comfortable bed, and he was sleeping comfortably snuggled up with his beloved wife.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, darling?" Mr. Gu rubbed his sleepy eyes and asked gently.</p>
<p>"Our Xiao Qian has been fostered out to another family for almost three years, and we have never gone to see him. I just dreamt that he came," Mrs. Gu woke up Mr. Gu and recounted her dream. "He was so lovely! Fair and chubby, lively and clever. As soon as he saw me, he ran over and threw himself into my arms, as affectionate as if we had been together since childhood. I asked him if he missed his mother, and he said he missed her very much, and he often thought of his father too."</p>
<p>Hearing that his child was being well cared for, Mr. Gu felt a wave of angelic joy and comfort welling up from the bottom of his heart. But thinking that he was already the father of five children, Da Qian, ten years old, You Qian, eight years old, and Zhong Qian, six years old, were already studying in a primary school. Ye Qian, four years old, was about to be sent to kindergarten. The school and living expenses for these four children were already considerable. He was the only one in the family who was selling his labor to earn money, and his ancestors hadn't left behind any property. This heavy burden was enough for him to bear. Although Xiao Qian was lovable, the thought of the future burden unconsciously weighed heavily on his heart.</p>
<p>"I think we should bring him back sooner rather than later," Mrs. Gu looked up, recalling the smiling face of her beloved son, not noticing Mr. Gu's worries. "If the child is fostered out for too long, he will not be affectionate towards his biological parents."</p>
<p>"I don't think so," Mr. Gu remembered the impending pressure and thought that being able to avoid it for a while was good. "The affection between parents and children is, after all, innate. Even if he is fostered out for a few more years, I don't think he will change his nature."</p>
<p>"No, I've seen several families who fostered out their children to other places, and after a long time, they became completely unaffectionate. Don't let our Xiao Qian be fostered out for too long, or he won't be affectionate to us in the future."</p>
<p>"I don't believe it," Mr. Gu knew that there was some truth in Mrs. Gu's words, but he wanted to use some dissenting words to stop his beloved wife's thoughts of her son, and to delay the burden that could not be avoided. "Didn't you just say that he was very affectionate with you?"</p>
<p>"That was just a dream after all, and the dream and the reality may be exactly the opposite," Mrs. Gu, not understanding Mr. Gu's heart, shattered his attempt and said, "For this reason, I'm even more thinking that we should bring him back sooner rather than later, to avoid that he really becomes unaffectionate in the future."</p>
<p>"Wouldn't it be better to bring him back later?" Mr. Gu said in a helpless, almost pleading tone, "Your health is not very good, and the children by your side are already enough trouble for you. Why bother looking for trouble? If we bring him back later, when the child is older, won't it reduce some trouble?"</p>
<p>"No, I miss him so much, you must go and bring him back for me!" Mrs. Gu was so thinking of her young son that she didn't dwell on Mr. Gu's words, and coquettishly insisted that Mr. Gu immediately bring their beloved son back from the foster family.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu loved Mrs. Gu too much, he couldn't bear to make his beloved wife feel uncomfortable. Although this matter would add some weight to his entire burden, and would increase the trouble for his weak wife, he carefully considered it and finally accepted his wife's suggestion.</p>
<p>"Then, I'll go and bring him back tomorrow," when Mr. Gu said this, Mrs. Gu immediately rejoiced, hugged Mr. Gu, and snuggled even closer.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Mrs. Gu's conjecture turned out to be a fact.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu traveled a long distance to bring their young son Xiao Qian back from a small village. The child wasn't as fair and chubby or as lively as Mrs. Gu had seen in her dream, but rather sallow and thin, with a small head, but very large eyes. His hand and leg bones were as thin as firewood, but his stomach was high and bulging, like a balloon filled with air. Moreover, he had an unusual habit: he liked to dig out the lime plastering the walls. When he found a piece, he would stuff it into his mouth, chewing and eating it with great relish. Such a strange child, none of their children had ever been like Xiao Qian. When Xiao Qian was mixed among the children, he looked so out of place that he didn't seem like their son at all.</p>
<p>Although Xiao Qian was not yet three years old, he did not recognize his biological parents at all. Although they kindly taught him to say "This is Daddy," "This is Mommy," he stood there bashfully, staring blankly, refusing to say a word.</p>
<p>"陌陌人！陌陌人！" (Strange person! Strange person!) When Mr. Gu or Mrs. Gu was affectionate with him, he would cry out like this.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu and Mrs. Gu began to feel regret. They regretted being greedy for a moment of ease, and fostering out their own child, who was only three months old when they were born two and a half years ago. Although liking children is human nature, and others may also love and caress the child, after all, they are not your own. There is a layer in between, and it is inevitable that they cannot take care of you thoughtfully. Children need the care of adults. Cold, heat, hunger, fullness, the trivialities of daily life can only be patiently accepted by biological parents, without fear of trouble.</p>
<p>Obviously, Xiao Qian's appearance was not normal. He also had a slight fever every afternoon, and when he had a fever, he was slightly short of breath, which added endless worries to his parents' hearts.</p>
<p>"Let's get a doctor to take a look. The child has a fever every day, maybe he has malaria," Mrs. Gu looked at the strangely shaped child, with more love than pity, and asked Mr. Gu for his consent, saying, "I heard that there are many mosquitoes in the countryside, so it's hard to avoid getting malaria."
