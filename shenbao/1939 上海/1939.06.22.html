<h3>上海的物價飛漲</h3>
<p>住在上海租界內的數百萬中外居民，現在都感覺到兩種極大的憂慮：一爲上海的局勢，將來是吾會遭遇天津和鼓浪嶼同樣的脅迫；一爲最近各種物價的飛漲，引起了一般居民的經濟恐慌，將來是吾會惡化到整個社會經濟混亂。前一個問題因爲有關歐美各國在華的權益，所以中外都不免憂形於色；而後者却還爲多數人所縈迴心頭。</p>
<p>最近上海各種物價的高漲，我們要特別認識淸楚的。這並不完全是黑市塲外滙率劇變的結果，也不是上海通貨的膨脹，更不是上海市塲上需要和供給的不相調和。中國政府對於黑市塲停止外滙的供給，其目的在减少上海對外貿易上的巨額入超，和防止日本對中國金融的破壞，因之上海商品市塲上遭受影響的，當爲需要外滙的洋貨，而與純粹的國產商品絕對沒有關係。至於中國的法幣，具有極充分的準備金；就上海一地而言，又絲毫沒有通貨膨脹的現象，這幾點自然不足以刺激一般物價的上升。至於現在上海市塲上各種商品的供需情形，雖然其中已有一部分商品被日本統制，但是大部分的商品並不感覺到供給的缺乏，可以作爲提高物價的理由。試以國米爲例；據調查上海現在存米五十二萬餘包，來源又並未阻塞；照理，牠的價格就不應有多大的變動；可是實際上國米的售價，在最近十天以內，竟由十六七元一石而遞增到二十二元以上，由此可見這决上海物價的高漲，是不能不歸咎於少數不肖商人投機操縱的結果。他們是利用洋貨的漲價，而故意將各種國貨價格抬高；是利用一般人民對上海局勢的恐懼心理，從而剝削他們的購買力，以圖厚利。</p>
<p>這種投機的行動，直接足以威脅到上海租界的安寗。在上海的居民中。有不少是依賴薪資度日的工商從業員，有不少是從內地逃來的難民，也有不少是上海局勢劇變前後的失業者，他們過去已經艱難度日；而在這决物價高漲聲中，又以日常必需品的漲價爲最迅速，這無異對於這大多數居民的困苦生活，再予以重大的壓迫。這種情形若聽令自由發展，再不積極設法阻止，將來難免不發生重大的社會問題。一九一八年時，日本曾因米的問題，而在京都大阪一帶，發生巨大騷動；數年前江蘇各處，也曾發生過搶米的風潮。這都是一般人民因生活發生問題而引起的不幸事件，這是租界當局和居民都應當特別注意的。並且在目前的局勢下，租界上如因生活問題而發生不幸事件，將予企圖刧持租界者以指責租界當局不能維持良好治安的口實，便更足以增加租界局勢的嚴重。</p>
<p>中國政府自實行抗戰以來，對於投機商人的高拾物價，曾頒佈有一定的罰則；但是現在的上海，已非中國政府的權力所能及，而法令的功效也已經削弱了。爲了取締租界上的投機行動，惟有切盼上海租界的當局和各公共法團，速謀切實有效的補救；最低限度，也當對於投機者予以制裁。</p>
<p>租界當局爲維持社會的安寗起見，對於租界內一般居民的生活問題，對於社會的經濟狀態，應迅即採取有效的行動，不妨利用警權，直接干涉物價的高漲。據傳公共租界對於限制米價，已擬有具體辦法；更願兩租界立即共同合作，對於一切日常生活上的必需商品，都暫時實施一種嚴密的控制辦法。這本來是在戰時初期業經行之有效的。現在不過舊事重提，以期更臻嚴密罷了。</p>
<p>同時希望上海的居民，務必以鎭靜的態度，應付當前的困難，切勿以物價的繼續上漲爲憂慮。而大量國儲商品，致反而墮入投機者的詭計；而在投機商人方面，我們却也希望他們能夠澈底覺悟，放棄因緣時會藉圖漁利的思想；要知道剝削大衆，趁火打刦，是不道德；而在握有警權兼負檢　職責的上海租界現行制度之下，租界當局艦可發動檢察之權，使抬價居奇、妨礙公安的奸商受法律制裁，是極可能的？那時候。社會決不會同情於奸商！</p>
<p>華南日本艦隊護送、午夜駛抵汕頭外某點、日軍立卽開始登陸、海軍則於今晨五時三十分侵佔各島嶼、擊破華軍之抵抗、晨八時三十分、日艦移柵掃雷、開始駛入汕頭港、據外務省發言人宣稱、日軍甫在華南從事之軍事行動、猶如自去年以來進行之戰爭、然僅係擴大純粹軍事行動、志在摧毀中政府對日作戰之重要根據地、日政府以前所行尊重第三國權益之政策、依然未變、在目前戰事中、雖將竭力防杜毀壞第三國權益、然切望第三國明瞭日本之眞正意向、對於日軍之努力、予以合作、以防發生任何不幸事件、（廿一日路透社電）</p>

<p>（香港）據此間華方人士觀察、自汕頭陷落之後、日方在粵之第二目標或爲韶關矣、據此間潮州商會中人言、在上是期中、華方雖曾派遣三萬大軍前往汕頭潮州一帶、但以該處地勢平坦、恐難爲有力之抵抗、惟在東江方面華軍必能對日軍作堅强之抵抗、以阻日軍向韶關之推進、（二十一日美聯社電）</p>

<p>（香港）此間接得報告稱、運載日兵之小船、在日本重巡洋艦猛烈轟炸之掩護下、駛入汕頭港口之內、有謂日軍已於本日午後兩三點鐘之間佔領汕頭者、（二十一日海通社電）</p>
<p>（東京）官塲公報稱、日軍侵佔汕頭外島嶼、移盡水雷後、日艦已於今晨八時三十分駛入汕頭港、（廿一日路透社電）</p>

<h3>絲茶　從一年來生絲出口　足爲華絲前途慶　艱難困苦中有此成績　足證自力更生之不難</h3>
<p>戰後二十月餘來之上海出口情况，在廿七年六月至二十八年五月一屆中，已有相當進出之表現。此一方面，固由於世界生絲產銷關係緊張，刺戟絲價上升所引起；他方面吾華絲業界主觀上之驚人努力，亦爲最重要之因素。觀乎戰後江浙絲廠之幾乎全部覆沒，以及戰局西移後的上海絲廠之重行新起，再至於全部新開絲廠在此屆中的幾乎全年日夜開工，使較少之生產工具，能獲得多量之勞働成果，此點，一方面固爲所有絲廠獲得更多利潤的原因之一，但他方面，使存亡絕續之時吾華生絲，依然能相當滿足國外之需求，使戰後幾瀕破產之「上海絲」，依然能週旋於國際市塲，，則誠爲此十二閱月中，上海絲業界勞資雙方莫大之貢獻。茲特調查一年來上海生絲出口詳情，列表於左，並附以近三年來之出口總額，以資比較：</p>
<p>一年來上海生絲出口統計（單位担）　綜觀上表，戰後第一年上海絲輸出，運歐洲者，較上一年下落一〇五六五担，運亞洲者下落四九六〇抯，運美者下落一七六八八抯，在戰事第一年中，上海生絲輸出總較上一年下落三二，二一三擔，如以絲價每祖一千元計，則是年因戰事而影響產絲出口者，當在三千二百萬元之上。然上年（二十七年六月一日至二十八年五月三十一日）一屆中，吾華絲業在上海復興的現象，深可忻喜，其表現在出口方面的，計已躍出第一年戰事時之一倍，計運美一九，一六九担，運歐一二，七一三抯，運亞非各地五，七一四祖，共達三七，五九六抯。此項數字雖遠不及戰前之水準，但此點已足够樹立吾人自立更生之信心，足够保證最後勝利時吾華絲　雄霸世界市塲之可能。（祥）</p>
<h3>金融　純金小半辦士　飾金仍懸原價</h3>
<p>現金烚赤暗盤市况、因値端節例假休業、而錢兌業門市亦多數停市、致烚赤塲外、未聞成交、</p>
<p>銀樓業門市、則仍照常營業、所懸首飾金、每兩兌出價、大同行仍爲二百七十元、新同行爲二百六十八元、收進二百六十二元，</p>
<p>中央銀行昨日照常辦公、因接二十日倫敦電、英純金又小半辦士、每盎斯退至七鎊八先令五辦士半、致該行之中國純金收買價、隨退至一千二百十一元九角、掛牌海關金仍二元三角九分六釐、上海標準標金價小四角、爲一千二百〇七元二角、</p>
<h3>大條暴縮　印銀再降</h3>
<p>二十日倫敦電、銀市印度及投機家賣出、缺少維持、市面疲軟、收盤後、平穩帶硬、印度及美商照掛牌價高〇六二五買進、但賣方供意殊淡、大條銀近期暴縮半便士、遠期猛跌四三七五、又紐的電、美銀呆定如故、又孟買電、印銀市况仍疲、現期貨均續降五安那、</p>
<p>又路透社二十一日倫敦電、今日銀價暴跌甚久、即期每盎斯市價固定於一九便士一二五、昨日則爲一九便士六二五、此决跌價、固非純出意外、其故多因一般人對於美國財部於六月杪以後購買外國白銀之政策、遲疑不定、遂起惶慮所致、聞市塲現缺買方、而有投機之賣出、及有多方之了結、致市塲受不正當之重大影響、消息戴通各界預料美財部未有決定時、不安定之情况將繼續不斷、今價格之變動、或即反映外傳關於此事之許多謠琢、</p>

<h3>紗花　棉紗在近期中　開出八千件左右</h3>
<p>紗市自外滙緊縮以來、市塲投機者紛紛活動、以致買進賣出籌碼驟增、市况變幻莫測、難以捉摸、查市上成交之內幕、有一部份多頭稍稍出籠、惟金業帮暨證券帮吸收之額、時進時出、因之波濤澎湃、大宗心理、仍以看漲占多數、不過銀根轉緊、金融界對於商品押款、有减低折扣之說、如果實行，買風或可稍見抑止也、最近以來、廠方開出粗細紗計七八千包之譜、其他各廠之生產棉紗棉布亦日見繁劇云、</p>
<p>至於棉花情形、本棉處於惡劣環境下殊無足述、但外棉受滙兌收縮影響、上漲不少、但其塊角、始終在盤旋之境、無大伸縮也、表內有「　」號者，無確實担保。</p>

<h3>日軍在汕登陸　航業界所得電訉　綏陽輪過汕被阻卸貨日軍在何處登陸未明　今日有兩英輪照常駛汕</h3>
<p>昨晨本市傅汕頭附近日軍登陸、但據航業界方面、至昨日傍晚、尙無確實消息、日軍究在何處登陸、雖各晚報均有香港專電、及路透電設實、但日軍所登陸之地名不詳、茲將昨日本市航商所得之消息錄下、</p>
<p>綏陽過汕並未靠岸</p>
<p>英輪綏陽號於十八日上午十時半、由滬儎貨赴汕頭香港、已於前日（二十日）晚抵汕、於昨晨黎明時擬開入港內卸貨、當爲某方勸阻、遂中止進口、旋即直駛香港、並電滬行報告、滬行因來電簡略、不明眞相、卽去電詢問、於午前又接該輪復電、大意謂汕頭附近日軍有登陸、受阻不得進、故直放香港云云、</p>
<p>汕頭口外結集日艦</p>
<p>英商輪船公司昨晨得悉綏陽輪之消息後、因該公司之新怡生輪、亦於十八日上午十一時、由滬赴汕、兼赴香港海防、計算亦在汕頭、何故汕頭形勢嚴重、該輪無電報告、遂於昨晨九時一刻拍電，致汕頭分行探詢、於十一時四十分、接汕行複電、祇謂口外日艦甚多、市內尚安謐、並無日軍登陸之字句、亦未關照停止裝儎去貨、</p>
<p>德生澤生照常進口</p>
<p>該公司今日有德生，澤生。兩輪、開往華南、兼灣汕頭、昨日本市雖有日軍登陸之消息、惟汕頭分行復電仍安謐、故客貨昨日照常裝儎、但一方知照客家、貨件照裝、如汕頭發生事變、該項貨件、均帶往香港、又據該行云、至昨日下午六時、汕頭無變化之消息、故兩輪準照預定船期、於今日下午二時半起椗赴汕、况兩輪均有無綫電之設備、可隨時通電、</p>
<h3>滬津貨運　業已暢通</h3>
<p>定生電告昨晨抵津　恒生今日載貨北行　　天津英法租界被日軍封鎖、至今日已有九天、本市赴津之英商輪、曾一度停裝貨物、後見日陞·順天·兩輪抵津、未遭搜查、形勢亦略較緩和、故前昨赴津之湖南。貴生兩輪、己恢復貨運、業誌前報、茲悉於十五日下午一時、由滬開往天津之怡和洋行定生輪、於昨（二十一日）晨五時始抵塘沽、該輪昨晨已來電報告、謂一俟塘沽麵粉卸淸後、即開往天津碼頭、聞該輪赴津、雖未裝貨、但給上有香港運津之洋行貨二百噸、故必須赴津起卸、卸淸後明日由津來滬、預計二十八日可到滬、今日該行又有恒生輪繼續儎貨運津、故天津租界之航運、業已暢通、</p>

<h3>兩租界努力　安全運動</h3>
<p>取締沿途攤販乞丐　免致阻塞發生禍端</p>
<p>公共租界工部局發起之安全運動宣傳週、自十八日開始以來、昨爲第四日、一切工作、均照常進行、惟兩租界警務處以行人道擺攤呌賣及沿路售賣小菜以及乞丐等、實爲破壞交通妨碍安全運動、蓋此輩攤販、堵塞人行道或馬路中、每使車輛行人有違越規章、故昨日出動至各馬路、對於領照攤販、予以糾正、無照則一律取締、乞丐則概予拘捕、俾使交通暢通、再自從兩租界實行行路章程後、市民耳聞目睹、均能遵守巡捕之指示、故秩序井然、</p>
<h3>滙山與楊樹浦　發現反日傅單　抨擊日方混亂中國金融　指「華興」以廢紙易法幣</h3>
<p>大　報云、星期日有人在滙山與楊樹浦西區散發大批「告中國民衆」之反日儷單、猛烈抨擊日方混亂中國金融制度之企圖、署名者爲「希望帮助汝等之人」、傳單發出後、大隊日憲兵</p>
<p>卽刻封鎖</p>
<p>鄰近一切通道、搜查行人車輛、傳單之一部份稱、汝等之血仇與準漢奸現已組織所謂「華興銀行」者、其目的在破壞汝等之貨幣制度、並用其所發廢紙易取汝等之法弊、</p>
<p>接受偽幣</p>
<p>不啻槍擊汝等自己之前綫勇士、無異用箭刺心、與自掘祖墓、更與任汝妻女在敵人壓迫下過奴隸生活無殊云、　　砂石進口捐稅　劃一徵收</p>
<p>每噸三角七分五釐須在淞口一次繳淸　　由泗礁等地運滬砂石、自戰事爆發後、因海關吳淞口分卡停頓、所有運滬砂石、俟駁至蘇州河後、再由海關抽徵捐稅、今吳淞口分卡業已恢復、對於砂石捐稅照常抽徵、照規定每噸三角七分五釐、本市砂石公會鑒於吳淞口海關分卡已恢復抽稅、惟所有砂石、一俟駁運蘇州河內、仍照舊抽徵捐稅、該會以事關同業負担、殊有商請海關劃一徵收必要、會同釣船運砂業同業公會致函江海關稅務司羅福德、請其令飭劃一徵收砂石捐稅、前曾由江海關函復該兩公會、准予照辦、茲悉該項捐稅、業經江海關當局規定辦法如下、（一）凡已在吳淞口分卡微收捐稅者、駁至蘇州河後、不再重徵、（二）規定每噸砂石抽捐三角七分五厘、須在吳淞口分卡一决繳淸、（三）如嗣後再有同樣事件發生、可向該關報告免微、茲江海關方面、連同辦法、業已通知吳淞口蘇州河二分卡稅警、</p>

<h3>歐洲難民計劃來華　開闢新「福地」　聞國府在某種情勢下　將准許此項計劃實行</h3>
<p>德銀行家鮑格拉斯披露</p>
<p>大陸報云、德國銀行家兼實業家鮑格拉斯、現與中政府高級官員磋商在中國闢新「福地」、根據組織縝密之經濟制度、而容歐洲難民十萬人、於是無家可歸之猶太難民問題、亦有可能的解決之兆矣、是項消息、係鮑氏本人昨（二十日）在華懋飯店招待新聞記者時所披露、據稱、中政府允其爲雲南省府、準備在某種情勢下、准許移民來華、有居住與工作之權、並享有政府保護及與中國公民相同之權利與責任、據鮑氏所發書面文告、其計劃大略如次、</p>
<p>移民須備充分費用</p>
<p>凡來中國者、均須携有足供一年左右膳宿費之款項、此款之一部份、用以購置移居所必需之物料、及開設商店、最初一二年、由世界各移民機關之主持人組織委員會與合作銀行各一、按照擬定之經濟制度、辦理膳宿與商業事宜、並使訓練、以備日後遇有機會、即能自立、中政府許多高級官員、已以私人名義贊同此議、不久可</p>
<p>經濟問題最爲困難</p>
<p>同時、巳函達世界各移民機關之領袖人物、微求彼等對此事之意見、實行是項計劃之前、或將遭遇之主要困難、厥爲經濟問題）但若加以有效的組織、大多數移民能於一二年後自立、鑒於移民欲赴世界各國、非不准入境、即於入境時極感困難、故此决機會、不應輕視、在廣博之國家中從事復興之機會頗多、而於戰事結束後、機會允夥、</p>
<p>政治動機竭力避免</p>
<p>今世有亟欲移居任何地點之人、其總數至少達五十萬之多、然與是項計劃有關各事、務須不具政治或秘密之動機、移民問題、須以經濟之基礎辦理、始能解決之云、鮑氏旋答覆記者之問話云、充拓荒者、須縝密遴選之、而殖居中國者最適宜之工作、厥爲運輸、機械　、與化學等類、是項計劃、不僅對猶太難民、即在目前情勢中之任何無家可歸者、不限於任何特殊宗敎、均將照、之、惟絕無政治性質、</p>
<p>利用移民開發富源</p>
<p>中國西南部向以潛藏富源著稱、若由歐人移殖、中政府與移民本身必兩得其利云、按鮑格拉斯即此計劃之主持人、已往五年中會數度來遊遠東、對於猶太難民問題、頗爲關切、</p>
<h3>端節安穩渡過　各業結賬順利　洋拆雖漲銀根未緊　放賬制度逐漸恢復</h3>
<p>放出之款如期收回呆賬極少</p>
<p>昨日爲端陽節、銀錢業暨各業市塲均休假、金融穩定、各業均安謐渡過、在畸形發展之下、各業逐漸恢復放賬制度、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>銀錢休假各業停市</p>
<p>銀錢兩業公會會員行莊暨市塲準備會庫交換所承兌所等夏節休假一天、各業市塲如豆米·證券·紗花·雜糧·麵粉·現金·糖業·棉布。等端陽節停市一天、各工廠行號公司亦大都休業、辦理端節結賬事宜、上海市民未能免俗、蒲艾角黍等充斥淤市，成爲居戶必備之品、至於外商銀行洋行以及工部局公董局等機關、亦循例停止辦公、</p>
<p>市塲穩定物價高漲</p>
<p>上海金融市塲依然穩定如恒、除錢業拆息升至二角五分外、其他各種利率鮮有變動、在畸形發展之下之上海、資金寬裕、運用困難、同時因人口增加、致造成囤積等投機事業、使物價飛漲、各業均能獲盈餘、所以今年之端節、各業放出之賬、均能收回、以前之舊賬、亦能收回一部份、惟自匯價緊俏後、洋貨漲價、爲各人意料之事、而大部份國貨、亦竟同時宣告漲價、殊令人寒心、投機份子以外匯套息可獲四分之利、趨之若鶩、致法幣需要增加、匯劃票據貼現率飛漲、每千元貼價達七十元、較諸前數日增加十六元之鉅、商入及資產階級、復紛以法幣購貨囤積、企圖操縱、待善價而沽、故本屆端節物價高漲、實爲往年未有之現象、</p>
<p>資金需要呆賬極少</p>
<p>滬上人口激增、各銀行戰地分支行均撤退至滬照常營業、故資金集中、存款增加、因資金過剩、投資途徑狹隘、致投機事業反見繁與、邇者物價高漲、購囤貨物、巳成爲生財之道、於是各行存款繼續减少、各銀行對於抵押放款、雖一度增高利率爲八元、但最近大都停止接受、可見頭寸需要過殷、供給不暢之一斑、因此年來資金過剩之現象、似已成爲過去之事跡、各銀行錢莊、因各業畸形發展、放出之款、亦如期收回、呆賬極少、</p>

<h3>維持民食　租界將定新米價　每石將先仰平至二十一元　滬存米充足市民毋庸憂慮</h3>

<p>租界考慮定新限價</p>
<p>公共租界工部局、自得米業團體建議辦法後、經硏究考慮之後、已有辦法決定、除竭力維持界內民食及穩定米價外、第一步先將米價抑低至某新限價、聞爲每石二十一元、並認爲滬市存米、尚稱充足、來源依然未斷、整個租界內民食、決無缺乏之虞、故盼望市民鎭靜、母須担憂、對於訂購洋米運滬接濟、認爲尚無必要、</p>
<p>管委會定今日集議</p>
<p>豆米市塲管理委員會、已定今日下午三時、邀集市塲一百零五家行號、勸導顧全大局、切勿作米之投機、以維滬市民食、而使米價抑平、又該市塲昨日起因辦理端節結賬、停市兩天、至二十三日開市交易、並希望端節後開市、使米價得以回跌至二十一元以內、囤戶再不作投機之交易、同時望各行號勸告各囤戶、際此黃霉時節、囤戶易生霉蛀不宜再行囤積、</p>
<p>上海存米六十萬包</p>
<p>本市民食、存底極度鹽厚、據豆米行業同業公會調查、上星期各米棧存米、尚有五十二萬三千八百二十二包、惟此僅係各米棧存米總數、他如米號門售及市民購進囤米、其數當不在鮮、據米業界估計、的達五六十萬包之巨、故本市民食、絕對無虞乏匱、然邇來米價之如此騰漲、原因即係　天津鼓浪嶼二地事件、引起市民購積、米號門售倍增、　因外匯緊縮、已訂西貢洋米、無法運滬接濟、以上二者、係奸商之投機良機、亦即米價高漲之二大原因也、</p>
<p>國米來源竭力疏通</p>
<p>各米業團體、除已建議租界當局設法抑平米價、派員協助維持市塲秩序等、現已經租界當局允納建議、惟各米業團體領袖、鑒於欲平定米價、首須疏通來源、藉以增厚存底、俾米價得以回跌、現楚項辦法、將於今日下午三時之市塲管理委員會議提出、聞近日各地產米區域運滬國米、已見增加、然各帮販運客商卒因無利可圖、已無往日之努力、昨日因農曆端節、各帮販商照例休假一天、故昨日無米船運滬、今日起仍將繼續採運、</p>
<h3>日兵車入租界　須經檢查</h3>
<p>前日大西路上　英軍執行職務</p>

<p>勸告市民厲行節約</p>
<p>滬市連日因外滙緊縮關係、各業又復紛紛漲價、開門七件、仰屋興嗟、米珠薪桂、饔飱不繼、孤島居民生活、已感嚴　威脅、然而酒綠燈紅、酣歌恒舞、卜畫卜夜、一擲千金、而毫無吝色者、亦大有人在、不知國破家亡、身將安寄、雖擁多金、有時而窮、况戰事延長、漫無止期、來日困頓、非可預卜、臥薪嘗胆、豈待異日、厲行節的、應從今始、際此百物騰貴、得省且省、稍能節虛靡之餘、報効國家、救濟災胞則心安理得、坐臥皆寗、節物力即所以培國力、救國難即所以救自身也、至於一般平民、允應體念物力維艱、屛除虛榮心理、戒絕奢侈習慣、使生活趨於樸素、庶難關得以勉渡、來日方長、艱鉅正殷、孤島同胞、幸共勉　、</p>

<h3>端節的符號</h3>
<p>— EL</p>
<p>纔吃罷了櫻桃酒釀，端陽又到。每天撕下一張日歷，眞是一舉手之勞而已。</p>
<p>由棉而夾，而單，衣服愈穿愈少，身上也愈覺輕鬆；可是一年三節，端陽倒是結賬的第一關，雖則大家對於「端陽看一看，中秋算一算，年夜還一半」的辦法，都能奉行不渝，終究看見了枇杷棕子，在精神上多少有些感應；於是無形中身上倒要吃重起來了。</p>
<p>「怎樣過節」？……節邊到了，不知錢在那裏？」……諸如此類的，都可以表現一般人對於節關的「生活感應律」呢。</p>
<p>用吃的符號來代表這龍舟節，那末三角倒很可以象徵粽子的平面。雖然現在的粽子，什麼蘇式，廣式，茶至於西式——某著名菜館的蓮蓉粽，英文的譯名爲「甜饀的布丁」——的「變化多端，」但是用三角形來代表它，涵義倒並不深奧，大家多能一望而知哩。</p>
<p>於此，我倒想出了三種符號米，代表偉大的一年三節：粽子，月餅，年糕，不是現成的三角，圓形，和正方麽？</p>
<p>簡單與誠實爲生活最好的紀律，這三個符號，可說得簡單之至了，而它們的象徵，倒也是最老實不過的。譬如把這些符號敎給小孩子，可以担保他們一定會了解的。如非將來的粽子都成了薄片，月餅換了方塊，年糕做成丸子，那末這些最簡單的變形綫條，方始會失掉意義哩。</p>
<p>在課室裏上幾何，這三種符號又是基礎的代表，各種的變化都由此而產生。從很簡單，可以化到很複雜。</p>
<p>人生本來像上算學課，年齡越大，負担越重，那算術的題目也越加複雜了。世界上人能够逃避這算術課的，恐怕很少。大部份人在一年之中顚來倒去，忽而三角，忽而圓，忽而方，總跳不出這簡單的人生之謎的符號。</p>
<p>話雖如此，過節總究是有意味的一回事。如果一年三百六十五日，無節無時的牛平過去，那生活不是也就要太平淡，太沒有節奏了麽？</p>
<p>一個三角形，小之像箭頭，大之像一座山，前者包含着前進，銳利，和穿刺的意議；後者暗示着鎭靜，雄偉，和奇拔的氣概；總之，小也好，大更妙，端午這符號活活的充滿了樂觀的情緒，和前進的意味呢。</p>
<p>我們希望在這一年中，從富有朝氣而象徵建設性的三角形開始，憑着鋒利的箭鏃，排除萬難而前進；然後穿過了渾沌的圓圈，達到那方正無缺的結局。</p>
<h3>怎樣獲得新鮮的空氣</h3>
<p>— 陸文理</p>
<p>城市裏，工廠林立，人口密佈，空氣決不能如城外郊野爲新鮮，所以如能生活於戶外，當然最佳。</p>
<p>但是世界上大部的事情，都得在室內工作，何况在這人滿爲息的孤島上，欲求謀得一屋內棲身之處，已非易易，那能多謀園地，以求理想的戶外生活呢？所以當今屋內空氣流通的問題，便得加以愼重的注意了。</p>
<p>人們呼出的氣，每較吸入的爲輕暖。在冬天，我們都能瞧見口中呼出的暖氣冉冉上昇，足資明證。所以在屋中高處宜設窗戶，以便呼出的空氣能自由從高處流出。相反的，我們如需求新鮮的空氣流入室內，那麼屋中低處便得設有窗戶了。這並不是說以强烈通風爲衛生，祇是居室中不得不有適當的新鮮空氣，以保障我們的健康。</p>
<p>每有一般人認有夜間的空氣，有害於人體，其實不然，夜間的空氣與白畫的並無差異，並無害處。所以眠時開啟窗戶，或於適當的氣候中，睡眠戶外，非但不礙康健，反可獲得通暢的新鮮空氣，有益身體呢。</p>
<h3>安全第一</h3>
<p>— 楊立齋</p>
<p>「馬路如虎口，當中不可走，」如果走路不小心，就要給沒有牙齒的老虎——車子碰傷，甚至喪生在車輪下的。尤其在最繁盛的上海，街道上「車水馬龍，」走路格外應該守着秩序，注意你自己的安全。</p>
<p>馬路上，有「行人道」（馬路旁邊的水門汀走道）的，須在行人道上走，勿走在馬路中。而且要「靠左邊走」，不得爭先，、這樣可以井井有序，减少衝撞的危險。如果沒有行人道的地方，要面對車行的方向行走——就是靠着馬路的右面，可以看見對面過來的車輛。</p>
<p>通過馬路，最好在有交通燈（十字路口指揮交通的紅綠燈）的地方；紅燈是呌你止步，開了綠燈才可以依着行人綫（馬路上漆着黃色的綫）一直通過。有些路口是沒有交通燈的，便要看指揮巡警的手勢，或是先向左看，再向右看，有沒有車子來往。如有車子將要駛來的時侯，不可冒險。萬一車子逼近你身邊時，你就馬上立停，不能倉皇的奔逃。</p>
<p>伶俐的小朋友！集中你的神精走路，安全第一！</p>
<h3>當心虎口</h3>
<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>洋葱近來便宜極了，輔幣一角，可買十六七隻，大可多吃一些。此物最富於維太命，並可開胃健肺，凡是肺弱的人，倘若天天吃，於身體上極有裨益，也許可以避免進入肺病的階段，所以葱蒜一類東西，不妨常吃，不要因爲吃後口中有惡味而就怕吃啊。洋葱的煮法，以洋葱炒牛肉絲爲最普通，吃的時候，果然津津有味，在炒的時候，先就異香撲鼻，使人開胃哩。此外用洋葱番薯燒牛肉湯，無論白燒紅燒都很可口，有不吃牛肉的，可以猪肉爲代，就是洋葱炒猪肉絲，也不妨試試，與牛肉絲不相上下。</p>
<p>星期一</p>
<p>洋葱牛肉絲　莧菜黃魚羹　乾絲炒芹菜　雪菜發芽豆</p>

<h3>從無名科學家沈協于氏的發明　談到荳鮮汁和原料鹽酸</h3>
<p>— 黃澄波</p>
<p>滬西無名科學家沈協于氏，畢生盡瘁化學事業，耗資鉅萬，雖祖遺家產，犧牲殆盡，鄕黨淺見人士，目爲痴騃，爲之齒冷，但沈君一意不衰，積三十年之經騐，卒化騐成功者，有各種菓子露精，如香蕉精，檸檬精，橘子精，蘋菓精等，曾經出有樣品，不佞親嘗之，芬香撲鼻，其他有肥皂，鐵筆蠟紙等，及其他物品多種。</p>
<p>沈氏以醬油爲日用必需品，我國醬園業雖多，然皆墨守成法，毫未改進，且醬油之製造，必賴陽光曝晒，並須使之發霉，殊不合衛生條件，因之着意改進，銳志研求，窮年累月，卒發明荳鮮汁。</p>
<p>荳鮮汁即醬油精之化名，製法簡便，成本低廉，味鮮美而能持久，決非尋常醬油過於濃厚回味有苦味者，且經科學方法，幾經提煉，原料用大豆渣滓之荳餅及陳碱等混合而成，故毫無毒素，極爲衛生，洵庖廚之良友也。</p>
<p>荳鮮汁發明後，沈氏一面將樣品呈送中央衛生署化騐，一面呈請實業部註冊，經核准後，乃與上海土布商張景福氏合作，以百元爲一股，招集一百股，合資一萬元，組織華明工業社，專事製造荳鮮汁以問世。</p>
<p>二十世紀是化學工業時代，而化學工業，根本脫不了「鹽酸」「硝酸」「硫酸」三酸，故可簡稱之爲三酸工業時代，荳鮮汁之製造，當然也逃不了三酸之一的「鹽酸」，它用莧餅陳碱和鹽酸配合而成，再加提煉，鹽酸亦爲軍需工業的要素，自滬上淪爲孤島後，四郊均被控制，甚至歐美人之海外通航，亦受種種留難，進出口普通貨物，亦全歸統制，何况有關軍需工業的鹽酸，自然更加屬目，因此，鹽酸之購置，感到相當的困難，沈氏利用天然化學頭腦，決以進求鹽酸的製造，古人說得好「有志者，事竟成」。幾經研鑽，居然達到了鹽酸自製的階段。目前各方所用鹽酸，均爲外貨，不但利權外溢，而且價格昂貴，成本加重，貨物隨之增高，影響於社會者至大，近來我國化學專家，果然不少，但同時一人能發明多種者，並不多覯，（沈君發明之物品，已載上文，但猶不止此。）何况沈氏不講求交際，至今尚未成名，交友要在未遇前，則可同患難，共甘苦，一經成名，不免身價十倍，耍請敎也就難了。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>同學</h3>
<p>— 耿之</p>
<p>人與人之間的結合，因血統關係而有「同姓」，因地域關係而有「同鄉」，都是有好處的，不在話下；此外因出身關係而有「同學」，似乎未嘗沒有好處，我也不能不分些筆墨之勞，代爲表彰一番。</p>
<p>在幾年之前，我們曾聽見過「某大系」（某大學的同學）把持着某省的教育，於是某省的教育界就成了「某大同學會」。範圍略小些，某校的教職員，都是某大學的同學，於是某校也就成了「某大同學會」。同樣，我們也聽見，某省的司法官，都是某法政學校的同學，於是某省的司法界，就成了「某法校的同學會；」或者都是留學某國的同學，於是成「了留某國的同學會」。……一成同學，聲價十倍，保障飯碗有着，可以吃着不盡。此即所謂同學的好處也</p>
<p>旣是「同學會」，「非同學」當然只有被排擠出來，而挿不進脚去。這「非同學」當然是要怨恨，要憤怒的。可是我爲他們打算，却以爲大可不必。誰又沒有同學呢？爲什麼自已不也造成幾個「同學會」來玩玩，却要去仰人鼻息，或者想分人杯羹呢？只要自己淘夥裹團體紮得聚，有神通，歷古以來原許人們造成淸一色而排斥異己的，何必客氣呢？造成了自己的同學會，也就可以坐享其成了。</p>
<p>原來凡是同學，總一定是很講義氣，會極盡彼此互助的能事的。譬如說古來的孫臏和龐涓吧，我也以爲他們倆無負於同學之誼：因爲孫臏沒有龐涓，那裹會被「臏」去了膝蓋骨，流芳百世，作個大丈夫，而龐涓沒有孫臏，那裹會被射死馬陵道中，遺臭萬年，也作個大丈夫——大丈夫不能流芳百世，亦當遺臭萬年！按此類推，所以他們的後輩同學蘇秦和張籤，雖然一般看米，似乎主張各異，感情也並不算好，可是你一個合縱，他一個連橫，一吹一唱，相得益彰，以異曲同工之妙，彼此都取得了卿相。這四個人，在六國閒就此結成了一個小小「鬼大（鬼谷大學）同學會」，眞可以和現代的「某大同學會」先後媲美。</p>
<p>再譬如說管寧和華歆吧，雖然弄到「割席」，我以爲他們還是不愧爲同學。因爲華欲的建功立業，甚至參加「逼宮」的盛舉，到底是管寧激成的，而管寧的高尚其事，不事王侯，叉未始非華欲所養成，這也是相反相成，各有千秋的一格。</p>
<p>再以現事而論，我們也常聽見說：某校有同學，不務正業，專鬥向其他的同學借錢，同學會特爲發通告，大家不要被騙；某校有某向舉，犯了不名譽的刑事案子，被羈獄中，同學會連忙登報吾認，他們沒有這個同學，……諸如此類的事情，我仍舊認爲同學會很講義氣，肯彼此互助，因爲這樣一來，也就足以使鄙夫廉，懦夫有立志了。他們是公承「鬼大同學會」的一貫作風的。至於爲那與己有利的同學，添隻把飯碗，那當然是題中應有的文章，不足掛齒了。</p>
<p>同學會的德政，在這一方面，眞正美不勝收，確要使我於表彰之外，再立下予欲無言的決心。可是還有和同學會一樣美的，也許更爲美好的事情，我却叉不能不連類一書，吾則我總覺得我所見之不廣。</p>
<p>這是所謂「同山門」，簡言之爲「同山」或「同產」。「同山」可以帮着講斤頭，打相打，固然是人盡皆知的美點，而一朝要成大事，假使你是「大哥」，更非有許多「同山」的「賢弟」帮忙不可，趙匡胤朱元璋之流的得以身登九五，就靠着這一點。現今此風漸漸流入了士大夫階級，頗有取「同學會」而代之之勢，說不定同學會竞會遭淘汰吧！</p>
<p>不過在「同學會」沒有遭淘汰之前，我總是艷羨着「同學少年多不賤，五陵裘馬自輕肥」的。我恨不得挿身每一個這樣的「同學會」中去！</p>
<h3>火的行列</h3>
<p>— 山蒂</p>
<p>靑石砌成的滑溜的馬路，今晚該又有着最活躍的姿態了窄狹的行人道上，麻麻密密的人依序地排成一條來的，一條去的。瞥瞬看去，他們擠擾得像海上捲起了千萬的怒濤。把行人道擠得太緊紥了，人一個個被洒到馬路中間來。</p>
<p>特別是最熱鬧馬路的轉角，和中古式的守更樓的梯級上，人們更是密麻得像天上的星星；他們並沒動，兀自伸長了頸項佇立着。</p>
<p>菜館也盡塞滿了各行各色的人，樓上更是擁密得沒有一隙之地；臨馬路的一排矮窗戶，承受了一大堆人的依靠，他們在瞭望，在瞭望這古老的山城的空前，熱鬧，盛大的一幕。</p>
<p>一片雄壯的鼓號聲，嘈雜的歡呼聲，終於穿過黑黝的長空播送得近了；人們叉是一陣喧擾的蠕動，像惟恐他們的位置由好的會變成壞的，由壞的不會變成好的。</p>
<p>偉大的火的行列由於交響的軍樂連的引導，莊嚴，熱烈，肃穆的移攏來了。像一條閃　着萬丈光芒的粗巨的火龍，蜿蜓，漫長，冉冉地躺着在曲動。</p>
<p>强烈的火熖，在人羣，房屋，樹叢，脾坊，……的表皮，塗上了一層波動的鮮艷的赤紅。</p>
<p>頭前，一幅巨大的浮露着勝利微笑的領袖的畫像，承着幾盞白亮的煤氣燈的照漾，使佇立着觀望的人們不禁肅然地生敬。巨像正在告示我們，他‘已經看見勝利的光焰了；他鼓勵我們依着他的指示，邁上光明成功的路。</p>
<p>排列在巨像旁邊的是兩個長方形的大燈籠從里面射出的白光，把上面寫的：「昆明市五四運動火炬大遊行」顯現得越發美麗了。</p>
<p>在鮮紅的火炬耀沛下行進的有：大學生，童子軍，小學生，兵士，職業團體的代表。……他們挺直了胸膛，合齊了步伐，爲掀起羣衆的情感而震天的怒吼着，爲祖國的勝利而動人的歌唱着，他們把悲觀，消極，敗北，……掃蕩得絲毫不留。</p>
<p>驀地走來了一隊黃黑色皮膚，陌生的臉色的「華僑機工回國服務團」；高大的箇子，劃一的軍服。擎起了每個都在在燃着的火炬。</p>
<p>他們不大會歌唱，但他們會用他們的方言，把他們壓緊得長久了的憎恨，忿怒？……從心的深處，變爲更洪大，更嘹亮的警透語出來了。每一句捷短的開始，他們情不自禁地用力把旗幟突地舉高，把火熖的整齊的綫的光波在他們的頭頂上抬起。</p>
<p>不再有甚麼顧及，盡暢的做了他們要想做的。動人的呼喊，發在的動作，使觀望的人們興奮得驚駭，浩漢，色舞，眉飛。恨不得加入他們的一羣，永隨着他們去戰鬥，服務，生活。……</p>
<p>煞尾，一羣同濟征募隊的隊員，不憚麻煩的沿着路的兩旁向行人道上的羣衆殷勤的勸募。而這剛受着新鮮的强度的刺激的一羣，雖然是老婆子，苦力們，也慷慨地從他們的身上撿出僅有的幾張鈔票，交給征募隊。隨着，這面被人懸空了的滿鋪着花花綠綠的紙幣的廣闊的璀璨的國旗上，又增加了好些重量。</p>
<p>幾個隊員，很興奮，很愉快，發出憨笑。……</p>
<p>回到了廣塲，動作都屛息了，讓無數的火炬會集在一起，熊熊地在燃着。火舌舐吻了無際的夜空。人們暢快地喊起最後的口號。……</p>
<p>大堆的烈火，還在熱心地，絕不停滯地充沛着耀眼的紅光。……</p>

<p>她笑一笑，</p>
<p>我的憂鬰遂化成，</p>
<p>一隻白鴿，</p>
<p>飛到遙遠的天心，</p>
<p>而消失了。</p>
<p>對着銀造的燭盤，</p>
<p>軍裝輕輕地閃光；</p>
<p>她那如銀的瞳子，</p>
<p>控制着我的感情。</p>
<p>你一定要出發嗎？</p>
<p>是的！</p>
<p>到前方？</p>
<p>是的！</p>
<p>明天嗎？</p>
<p>是的！</p>
<p>那末想你的家嗎？</p>
<p>我說「不！」（誰不呢？）</p>
<p>那末亦不想念我？</p>
<p>我說「不！」（誰不呢？）</p>
<p>（帳幕外的天是烏黑，</p>

<p>在銀的燭光下，</p>
<p>望着我閃光的軍服，</p>

<h3>印象的旅遊（續）</h3>
<p>— 黎錦明</p>
<p>我們都不懂得這東西的巧處，祇是呆着看了一會。</p>
<p>恰適燈點上了，我拿起那題名冊子來，翻了一遍。上面滿是詩和紀念文。露名或匿名的詩人騒士的筆蹟，淋漓滿紙。寫上幾隻字，也許覺得有些意味罷，我這樣想，便操着筆，寫了幾行：</p>
<p>重重山嶺，密密停雲，</p>
<p>祇見和尚，不見道人；</p>
<p>和尚富庶，百姓貪窮，</p>
<p>且把酒來，喝個微醺。</p>
<p>大彭小彭看着我這樣寫，有些不忍。因爲不得當的諷刺，是要遭受賓主間不歡的。但凶臉和尚倒是有些特別性格的人，他看了，先不快，隨即父說：「豁達，豁達！稱讚我富庶總是好的，酒是一定有得喝的。法靜！快去預備，管他百姓百姓，我們不辱沒他們就彀啦！可是這不叶韻呵！」一</p>
<p>「管他，我不是詩人，」我放下筆。</p>
<p>他請大彭執筆，大彭寫着</p>
<p>見雲如見佛。</p>
<p>又請小彭，小彭却來得更簡鍊：</p>
<p>賞風。</p>
<p>「好呀，賞風！」凶臉和尚呌着說，「看來平常，一到上封寺，就曉得這兩宇的不朽啦。」</p>
<p>晚上十點鐘，月亮緣進窗來，大彭小彭都呼呼地睡了，祇見他們臉上疲倦的筋肉鬆弛地在抖動。我却胡亂地想着，想到這麼一個好環境，偏偏住着一羣蠢笨的，借菩薩名義偷生的懶貨。</p>
<p>我想，「設若這些人仍是一羣作家，不知道他們將來會寫出一些怎樣的作品。也許要離開人生眞義，也許耍逃避時代，也許要把藝術變得那麼輕逸無謂吧，但如果我們是這一羣人，我們會使用過去的經歷和想象圖幅的。我們也許耍變成魏吉爾，波加息，歌德，佛魯貝爾……，我們得把意志來做文學。陶淵明，李白，陸游，……這都是較爲高超的詩人，但都不是我們所取法的，凡中國的民族作家都不應效法。他們都有逃遯的失敗的思想。這所謂逃遯，是不得「登仕途」，失敗觀，也是爲的吃不到「俸祿」。這都不成爲作家的品格；我們應該咒詈這種心理</p>
<h3>談餘</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>據「愛國者」的譯者之一朱雯先生告訴我，繙譯這書的，就上海一處而論，共有七家之多。這本書應吾如此大捧，是另一個問題，昨天已經談過了。但我想，假使有那一位，肯將這七種譯本，就繙譯這方面，比蛟一下，寫成文章，給大家看看，總也是有益的事情吧。我希望果然有人肯做道件工作。</p>

<h3>露天電影塲的滄桑</h3>
<p>— 德惠</p>
<p>以城內西園新園爲最早　戰前露天影場有六七家　今年夏天不知能否重現</p>
<p>在夏天的季節裹，上海會有不少應時的遊玩塲所出現，露天電影塲，便是其中之一。一般的觀衆在極高的氣溫下，覺得坐在有冷氣設備的電影院裹究屬不及坐在那滿天星光燦爛下，凉風習習的草地露天電影塲上來得適意。露天電影塲爲了適應這客觀的要求，就很多的設置起來。</p>
<p>露天電影塲首先在上海發現的，要以遜淸宜統二年城區裏的西園和新園二個花園中的放映電影爲最早了。可是當時因風氣關係。結果被自治公所取締了。這樣的隔了十餘年，在民十三年，才再有這露天電影塲的興起，那就是靶子路消夏電影塲和靜安寺路的聖喬治露天影戲院。在設備方面比較起來，後者比前者爲完善，塲地是在綠草如茵的花園裹，一排排的坐椅上，還放了啤酒和汽水，任入塲的人們，隨意所欲的飲喝，映片亦較爲上選，所以好玩閒的多趨之若騖。</p>
<p>民國十四年夏天，靜安寺路大華飯店（現早拆毀）附設了大華露天影戲園，因地點適中，交通便利，設備完善，選映影片，更是第一流，一到晚上，座客常滿，握着露犬電影塲的首位，這樣直到大華出賣爲止。</p>
<p>以後的崛起者有跑馬廳電影塲，邁爾西愛路凡爾登花園電影塲，膠州路康腦脫路也開設過。而電影院屋頂平坦的，則如新世界福星大戲院；（即現逍遙舞廳）福生路百星大戲院，有一時期，也曾放映露天電影過。此外，遊藝塲屋頂放映露天電影，更爲普遍。但因爲是附屬的，所以不像獨立的使人注意。露天電影塲，過往歷史也有不少滄桑可說，大華飯店的被拆毀，福星變作逍遙舞廳，聖喬治巳不復存在，百星也多年不營此道了。其在近年來開設的露天電影塲，較大的祗有跑馬廳和邁爾西愛路的一個花園裹的兩家，而愛多亞路大華舞廳屋頂，也曾開設過</p>
<p>戰後的上海，巳有兩度夏季沒有露天電影塲了，今年的夏天，不知露天電影塲能否重現？</p>
<h3>余叔岩之舊事重提</h3>
<p>— 劉正鵠</p>
<p>名伶余叔岩，家學淵源，私淑老譚，雖未入室確已升堂；近二十年來稱雄菊部，執鬚生之牛耳，無論內外行，咸一致公認爲鑫培後之一人，在故都社會，人皆以「小余」呼之。小余之　間達爐火純靑之候，獨其賦性孤僻，傲世離羣，最爲人不滿，是其一生遺憾。平素不喜多言，舉動冷靜，實際即是「傲」耳。恃才傲物，腎者不免，吾又何苦獨責小余乎？回溯十餘年前允鴻卿主持丹桂時，小余蒞滬，以譚派正宗標榜，詎料曲高和寡，未得滬人重視；下馬殺威，大感掃興，共結果丹桂白忙一番，雖無虧折，亦無盈餘，演唱期滿，鴻卿因謂其帮忙一星期，不能則三天，再不能卽兩天一天亦可。其間並由名流關炯之等十餘人，從中代允關說，小余竟堅拒不應，允怒甚，其徒衆更憤憤不平，因曰：交情尚往還，小余何人，竟不肯賣面子，一至於斯；待其登輪之日，且看特別餞行吧。蓋弦外之音，擬將施不利於小余，而加以凌辱者。幸季雲卿兄得耗，立馳往一品香晤小余，（小余夫婦原下榻大東旅社，賢梁孟皆嗜烟霞，曲罷歸來，夜深人靜，橫陳一榻，誤遺香烟屁股，延燒帳被，幾肇焚如，經大東下逐客令，請其移居，故改居一品香，）要其必須延演一日，大家面子攸關，吾則不歡而散，君雖終身不再南來，何必留此惡劣印象。小余碍於雲卿情面，目不能再却，僅允唱一日，貼全本珠簾寨，是夕臨別，竟賣滿堂，彼此皆大歡喜，漫天風雲，經雲卿片言解釋，登時烟消雲散。最後雲卿又謂在丹挂之後，彼曾與天蟾許少卿，同車北上，少卿專爲邀小余而來，抵平同往晤於其腐邸，小余歡然把晤，暢談別情，惟置許座一旁，彷彿不識，雲卿恐少卿難堪，特爲介紹。小余冷然曰，本是熟人。蓋其傲態，每每如此，旋小余出其家藏鼻烟，以贈雲卿，惟南人素不嗜此，再辭而後受，迄今留在篋中，作爲紀念品云</p>

<p>— 愛萍室主</p>
<p>月之三日夜，黃金貼「戰宛城」，此劇一名「馬踏靑苗」，又名「割髪代首」亦名張繡刺嬸一。花旦飾此劇中之鄒氏一角者，曩以田桐秋（桂風）最優，桐秋扮相體麗，做派神情精細，允以睹鼠思春一塲表演之傳神，實堪尋味，今則推小翠花最優。武生飾此劇中之張繡，自以楊小樓爲個中第一，老譚在日，亦嘗以此劇名，爲配鄒氏者，即田桂風也。</p>
<p>是日由毛世來飾鄒氏，淡裝濃沫，活似一風流寡婦，思春一塲，素衣如雪，彷彿帶雨哀梨，其聞鼠嘶之左尋右找，頗爲細膩，實不多讓小翠花一人專美，百景樓頭見曹操（裘盛戎飾）一塲，眉目傳情，被擄見曹，亦驚亦羞，有　有愛，將鄒氏當日之心事曲曲傳出，其他聞驚報之急，被拋棄之憤，俱能精到，允以被刺一塲，膝行移步之接槍，反身，以及「烏龍繞柱一之兜滿台，更屬美妙耐觀之至。</p>
<p>高盛麟之張繡，是日賣力異常，其認曹作父時之說白神情，不瘟不火，恰到好處，與打小將時之敵號萬人，前後判若二人，各塲均龍將張繡之怒，忍，憤，慨種種神態，盡量表出，益以裘盛戎配演曹操，尤屬精彩百倍，餘如貫盛習之賈詡，艾世菊之胡車，張連亭之許褚，搭配皆極稱職，泃佳劇也。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>臥雲居的墮落與李多奎的上進</p>
<p>自此以後對於龔氏的絕學，更能得到眞傳，老龔身體多病，又兼年事日高，對於搭班及堂會諸事，簡直不大應酬，有時情人可却，就舉臥雲自代，並且連自己的琴師（陸五）鼓手都一齊移贈於臥雲，由此可見老龔之愛惜其高徒已達於極點，所以民十前後的臥雲居士，眞可謂紅極一時，名滿平津，凡老於顧曲的人們，無不譽之爲龔處（龔處，孫處，皆雲甫，菊仙玩票時之名）第二了。</p>
<p>大凡作藝的人都不可太滿太驕，臥雲鑒於老龔日益衰老，同時老旦行裹又沒有繼起之人，所以他就自負的了不得，性情也就一天傲似一天。不想在民國十四五年問，忽然老旦行裹出來了個李多奎，後來居然與他爭雄起來。提起多奎的歷史，也並不怎樣高貴，他雖也是梨園世界，但却不是二黃班裹的人，從前奏腔鬚生泰斗郭寳臣（即老兀元紅），有一個拉呼呼的李某，就是多奎的伯父。當年郭寳臣的聲望是和皮黃班的譚鑫培並駕齊驅的，因而呼呼李也就與梅雨田的名氣不相上下了。梆子班所用的提琴，普通都稱之爲呼呼，多奎的伯父對於呼呼極有研究，托腔也好，相隨郭氏甚久，郭無李爲輔，簡直不願登臺，亦如梅之與譚一樣，因爲有上述這個原因，故而呼呼亦曾名滿平津各埠。多奎本來也學過梆子，後來鑒於秦腔已不爲時重，遂父改習二黃，初演鬚生，會以「取成都」「文昭關」等在派劇享名於烟臺，哈爾濱，等處。彼身材矮小，衷一氣甚足，出口能唱乙字調，他旣有此佳喉，故而到處都能博得顧客歡迎。（四三）</p>

<p>當拆夥期中，胖子哈代仍繼纕拍片，拉攏女星瓊派克作柱子，一時沒有下手，就在動物園裏抓住幾頭象搭擋，聶成一片，名爲一家大哥Elephant　Never　Forget。這片近已在倫敦上演了，當攝製時因象身笨重，毫無噱頭，哈代除攀住象尾嘶喚，或壓在象肚下睡覺外，已別無施展。早已呌苦不巳，所以這回和勞萊再度合作，非常高興，將把兩人拆夥期中顛沛流離，作爲新片的題材。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Land on Hao Island; Fierce Street Fighting Erupts in Shantou; City Engulfed in Flames as Most Residents Evacuate; Strong Defenses Outside Shantou Control the Overall Situation; Foreigners Fear Abuse by Japanese Soldiers and Gather at Quakeshi Awaiting Rescue</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Foreigners in Hong Kong received a telegram from Shantou reporting that thousands of Japanese army and naval personnel landed in two locations several miles outside Shantou City around 4:00 AM this morning, advancing inland and encountering fierce resistance from Chinese troops. Casualties were heavy on both sides, and fierce fighting is ongoing. At noon, Hong Kong's telecommunications with Shantou, foreign exchange, and cargo transportation were all suspended. Jardine Matheson's "Hosho" and Swire's "Fuzhou" ships were ordered by their companies at 3:00 PM to retreat from Shantou, unload the cargo bound for Shantou, and temporarily cease docking there in the future. The Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Bank in Shantou City had already relocated to Hong Kong, and the Provincial Bank had also moved to the inner city. Most of the foreigners in Shantou are British, with about forty or fifty American expatriates as well. Only the British warship "Danae" is present, and it remains to be seen whether we will send additional warships. Hong Kong naval authorities have not yet made any statement. The fall of Shantou will slightly affect Hong Kong's food supply. According to a military figure in Hong Kong, the loss or gain of Shantou is not significant, as we have already made strong arrangements on the outskirts of Shantou, sufficient to control the overall situation. Even if Japanese troops manage to gain a foothold in Shantou, it will be difficult for them to deploy. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Chao'an: Japanese warships broke through the blockade line at Mayu Island at around 10:00 AM on the 21st and continued to invade Shantou City. Chinese defenders calmly responded, waiting for the Japanese ships to approach before suddenly opening fire, sinking more than ten Japanese ships. However, under the cover of naval gunfire and aircraft, the Japanese forcibly landed and entered street fighting at 11:00 AM. As of the time of the dispatch, Chinese and Japanese forces were still engaged in fierce combat. (21st Urgent Telegram)</p>
<p>Chao'an: The Japanese invasion of Shantou was expected by the Chinese military. Therefore, the city's residents were evacuated and materials were relocated as much as possible in advance, and fortifications were set up inside and outside the city, preparing to inflict the greatest possible cost on the Japanese through street fighting. Because Shantou is located on the coast, it is within range of Japanese naval gunfire, which can threaten Chinese forces at any time. According to telephone reports from the front, Chinese defenders are currently holding firm in important streets and alleys in the city, fighting the Japanese troops. As of 4:00 PM, fierce fighting was still ongoing. The Chinese military authorities have now deployed reinforcements, and more intense street fighting is expected in Shantou City. (21st Telegram)</p>
<p>(Shantou) Ten Japanese planes suddenly launched a frenzied attack on Shantou City at 5:00 AM on the 21st. At 5:30 AM, more than ten Japanese warships and dozens of motorboats gathered outside Mayu Island, invading Shantou City, immediately engaging in artillery battles with the Chinese coastal defense forces. Under the cover of artillery fire, Japanese motorboats broke through the blockade line at 10:09 AM, and at the same time, hundreds of Japanese soldiers forcibly landed on the eastern shore of Da Hao Island west of Mayu Island. Chinese defenders rose up in resistance, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. (21st Urgent Telegram, 10:30 AM)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) After Japanese troops landed near Shantou this morning, they continued to advance inland without encountering strong resistance. The Japanese landing was covered by intense artillery fire, and the Chinese military apparently had not prepared in advance. Before the landing, the Japanese detained three British ships (Suiyang, Yisheng, and Mora), warning them not to enter the port. A US destroyer is currently docked in Shantou, and its captain, Mr. Steibora, will arrive in Shantou today. Currently, there are a total of forty American expatriates residing in Shantou. The US warship "Pope" left Hong Kong for Xiamen yesterday, but has now decided to sail to Shantou. At the same time, the US warship "Areyville" docked in Hong Kong is also preparing to sail to Shantou. According to British naval sources, they have not yet received orders to proceed to Shantou. (21st Associated Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Shantou) British and American merchants here attach great importance to the Japanese invasion of Shantou. Women, children, and most merchants are deeply concerned about being killed by Japanese soldiers, and have gathered at Quakeshi facing the sea in Shantou, eagerly hoping that British and American warships will quickly sail to protect them. According to foreign observers, Shantou is located in a remote corner of the sea, and the Japanese could have invaded at any time. The reason why they waited until today to launch the attack is clearly influenced by the Tianjin British Concession incident, hoping to use this to make further demonstrations against Britain. Shantou is only 188 nautical miles from Hong Kong, and the Japanese navy and air force have long wanted to use it as a base to threaten Hong Kong and its connections with the Philippines. (21st Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to reports received here, a large contingent of Japanese troops suddenly landed in two teams two miles from Shantou at dawn today, attempting to advance inland. Chinese troops rose up to resist, and both sides suffered heavy losses and are still engaged in fierce fighting. Currently, the foreign residents in Shantou are mostly British, followed by Americans, but only fifty in total. (21st Haitong News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Japanese sources, after Japanese troops landed at two locations in Shantou port this morning, they occupied Shantou City at 2:30 PM today. Another Japanese force advancing north reached Anbu, nine miles north of Shantou, this afternoon. It is reported that before the Japanese landing, all Japanese warships currently in the coastal waters near Shantou subjected the shore to intense shelling. Japanese planes also repeatedly bombed Shantou and Chinese military positions from morning to noon, almost without stopping. However, all foreign nationals currently in Shantou City are very safe. As for the Chinese residents, most have evacuated under the orders of the Chinese garrison. A fire has now broken out in Shantou City, but it is not yet certain whether it is the result of Japanese naval and air bombardment or the result of the Chinese "scorched earth policy." Although Shantou has no concessions, there are many foreign nationals, and in the interior, there are a large number of foreign missionaries. As of this afternoon, six Japanese destroyers were docked in Shantou port, three of which sailed up the river, but remained docked near the Swire and Jardine Matheson wharves. One was docked opposite the Asiatic Petroleum depot. According to an announcement issued today by the Japanese Consul in Hong Kong, "Since the fall of Guangzhou, Shantou has become an important port for the Chinese side to obtain military supplies from the outside world, and its occupation by the Japanese side will be a blow to Chongqing." The announcement also stated that the first Japanese landing took place at the upper and lower points of Shantou at 4:00 AM, with an initial force of only 350 to 500 men, who first "pacified" the Chinese troops on both sides of the Han River, and then the main force and mechanized units, followed by heavy artillery, landed. Another Japanese force departed from Nan'ao and landed north of Shantou, now advancing north with the intention of cutting off the railway at Huzhou, 27 miles north of Shantou. Since the fall of Guangzhou, Shantou has become a relatively important import and export port for China, importing armaments and raw materials, and exporting tungsten and tung oil. (21st Associated Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to official announcements, Japanese naval and army units landed in three locations near Shantou before dawn today without casualties. Japanese forces are now rapidly advancing towards Shantou. Naval Headquarters issued a communiqué stating that Japanese transport ships carrying Japanese troops, escorted by the Japanese South China Fleet, arrived at a point outside Shantou at midnight. Japanese troops immediately began landing, and the Navy occupied the islands at 5:30 AM this morning, breaking through Chinese resistance. At 8:30 AM, Japanese ships moved fences and cleared mines, beginning to sail into Shantou port. According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the military action undertaken by Japanese forces in South China is an expansion of purely military operations, as in the war being waged since last year, aimed at destroying important bases from which the Chinese government conducts war against Japan. The Japanese government's policy of respecting the rights and interests of third countries remains unchanged. In the current war, while efforts will be made to prevent damage to the rights and interests of third countries, it is hoped that third countries will understand Japan's true intentions and cooperate with the efforts of the Japanese military to prevent any unfortunate events from occurring.

<p>(Hong Kong) According to a Japanese communiqué, Japanese army and naval units landed at two locations near Shantou today, and despite fierce resistance, they are advancing inland. Fighting is currently underway. According to reliable sources beforehand, the Japanese military blocked British ships outside Shantou port, instructing them not to enter the port, which served as a harbinger of the Japanese military action. British ships blocked include Yisheng, Suiyang, and Manli Maru. The British destroyer Snapdragon (905 tons) is currently docked in Shantou, observing the situation. The US ship Pierce Bailey is also there. It is reported that there are currently forty American expatriates in Shantou, with an additional twenty residing inland. The number of British expatriates is also considerable. Furthermore, shortly after 4:00 AM, 300-500 Japanese soldiers first landed in Shantou, and after fierce resistance on both banks of the river, the Japanese troops achieved their objective at 9:00 AM. Transport ships then sailed up the river, with troops and mechanized units disembarking continuously. At the same time, the vanguard is advancing inland on both sides of Shantou, apparently intending to encircle the city and cut off the railway between Shantou and Chaozhou, 27 miles from the coast.

<p>(Hong Kong) According to observations by Chinese sources here, after the fall of Shantou, the second Japanese target in Guangdong may be Shaoguan. According to people in the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce here, although the Chinese side had dispatched 30,000 troops to the Shantou-Chaozhou area during this period, it is feared that effective resistance will be difficult due to the flat terrain. However, Chinese forces on the East River will be able to mount a strong resistance to the Japanese army, preventing the Japanese army from advancing towards Shaoguan.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Soaring Prices in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The millions of Chinese and foreign residents living in the Shanghai concessions are now experiencing two major concerns: First, whether Shanghai's situation will lead to the same coercion experienced in Tianjin and Gulangyu; second, the recent soaring prices of various commodities, which have caused economic panic among ordinary residents, and whether this will deteriorate into overall social and economic chaos. The former issue is of concern to both China and foreign countries because it involves the rights and interests of European and American countries in China; while the latter is still the focus of attention for most people.</p>
<p>We must clearly understand the recent rise in prices of various commodities in Shanghai. This is not entirely the result of drastic changes in black market exchange rates, nor is it the result of inflation in Shanghai currency, nor is it due to an imbalance between supply and demand in the Shanghai market. The Chinese government's cessation of foreign exchange supply in the black market is intended to reduce Shanghai's huge trade deficit and prevent Japan from undermining Chinese finance. As a result, the Shanghai commodity market is affected by foreign goods that require foreign exchange, and is absolutely unrelated to purely domestic goods. As for China's legal tender, it has very sufficient reserves; as far as Shanghai is concerned, there is no phenomenon of inflation at all. These points are naturally not enough to stimulate a general rise in prices. As for the current supply and demand situation of various commodities in the Shanghai market, although some commodities have been controlled by Japan, most commodities do not feel a lack of supply, which can be used as a reason to raise prices. Take domestic rice as an example; according to surveys, Shanghai currently has more than 520,000 bags of rice in stock, and the source has not been blocked. In theory, its price should not fluctuate much; but in reality, the selling price of domestic rice has increased from 16 or 17 yuan per picul to more than 22 yuan within the past ten days. It can be seen from this that the rise in prices in Shanghai cannot but be attributed to the speculative manipulation of a few unscrupulous merchants. They are taking advantage of the rise in prices of foreign goods to deliberately raise the prices of various domestic goods; they are taking advantage of the general public's fear of the situation in Shanghai, thereby exploiting their purchasing power to seek huge profits.</p>
<p>Such speculative behavior is directly enough to threaten the tranquility of the Shanghai concessions. Among the residents of Shanghai, there are many industrial and commercial employees who depend on wages, many refugees who have fled from the interior, and many unemployed people before and after the drastic changes in the Shanghai situation. They have already had a difficult time; and in the sound of rising prices, the rise in prices of daily necessities is the most rapid. This is tantamount to imposing a significant oppression on the difficult lives of the majority of residents. If this situation is allowed to develop freely without active efforts to stop it, it will inevitably lead to major social problems in the future. In 1918, Japan experienced huge riots in the Kyoto and Osaka areas due to rice problems; a few years ago, rice riots also occurred in various parts of Jiangsu. These are all unfortunate incidents caused by the fact that the lives of the general public have problems. This is something that the concession authorities and residents should pay special attention to. Moreover, under the current situation, if unfortunate incidents occur in the concessions due to livelihood issues, they will provide an excuse for those who attempt to seize the concessions to accuse the concession authorities of failing to maintain good law and order, which will further increase the severity of the concession situation.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the war of resistance against Japan, the Chinese government has promulgated certain penalties for speculators who raise prices; but the current Shanghai is no longer within the reach of the Chinese government's power, and the effectiveness of the law has been weakened. In order to crack down on speculative activities in the concessions, we can only hope that the authorities of the Shanghai concessions and various public legal entities will quickly seek effective remedies; at a minimum, speculators should be sanctioned.</p>
<p>For the sake of maintaining social tranquility, the concession authorities should take effective action to address the livelihood issues of the general residents in the concessions and the economic conditions of society, and may use police power to directly intervene in the rise in prices. It is said that the Public Concession has drafted concrete measures to limit rice prices; it is even more desirable for the two concessions to immediately cooperate to temporarily implement strict control measures for all daily necessities. This was originally effective in the early stages of the war. Now it is just a matter of reiterating old things, in order to make them more rigorous.</p>
<p>At the same time, I hope that the residents of Shanghai will deal with the current difficulties in a calm manner, and do not worry about the continued rise in prices. A large number of state-owned goods are stored, which may instead fall into the trickery of speculators; on the other hand, we also hope that speculators can thoroughly realize that it is immoral to exploit the public and take advantage of the fire; and under the current system of the Shanghai concessions, which has police power and the responsibility of inspection, the concession authorities can initiate the power of inspection to make it possible for unscrupulous merchants who raise prices and disrupt public safety to be punished by law. At that time. Society will never sympathize with unscrupulous merchants!</p>

<h3>British Prime Minister Addresses the House of Commons on the Recent Situation in Tianjin; Government Awaits Further Reports; No Decision Yet on Action; Protest Against Discrimination Against British Nationals Explicitly Rejected by Japan</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain addressed the House of Commons today on the latest intelligence regarding the situation in Tianjin, stating that the Japanese side did not appear to be prohibiting the transport of food into the British Concession. In response to several questions from members of Parliament, the Prime Minister stated that the restrictive regulations isolating the Concession remained in effect and had not changed. Four British nationals had been stripped and searched, but the latest telegram from the British Consul-General in Tianjin did not mention any further incidents of this kind. A Japanese news agency announced that the barbed wire barrier surrounding the French Concession had been electrified on the evening of June 19. There are large stocks of rice and flour within the British Concession, and perishable foods are occasionally transported in, but the quantities are far lower than usual. The Japanese authorities claim that all items, such as vegetables, must be inspected in front of the barrier, so the transport of goods into the Concession is greatly delayed. Regarding shipping, everything has improved greatly, and ships sailing on the Baihe River recently have not been intercepted by the Japanese military authorities. When Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, met with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, he enumerated various unfortunate incidents that had occurred since the Japanese side implemented the blockade. Arita had agreed to investigate Sir Craigie's complaints about discrimination and abuse of British nationals. The Japanese government's position on the Tianjin dispute remains unclear, so it has not yet been decided whether the dispute will be discussed in Tokyo or in Tianjin. The British government will continue to receive reports on this matter in the next day or two, the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister also answered a question from Labour MP Mr. 台, stating that he had heard that British nationals had indeed been subjected to violent treatment by the Japanese, and the government was currently investigating the matter. Labour MP Mr. Henderson asked whether the Prime Minister's answer implied that the Japanese government had not yet clearly stated any grievances it had against Britain, and whether this would make negotiations very difficult. The Prime Minister replied that it was indeed very difficult and that he hoped the Japanese government would state any grievances it had. Former Foreign Secretary Eden asked whether Sir Robert Craigie had explicitly stated in his talks with the Japanese government that the British government was unwilling to tolerate this blockade and that the British government intended to take any steps it deemed necessary to safeguard the food supply for British nationals in the foreign district. The Prime Minister replied that Sir Craigie had stated this and that Sir Craigie had explicitly stated to the Japanese government that we could not tolerate this blockade. The Prime Minister also answered a question from Liberal leader Sinclair, stating that the government was constantly studying the matter of ensuring food supply. Conservative MP Adams asked whether the government had considered the possibility of airlifting food supplies to the British Concession. The Prime Minister replied that the entire situation was currently under consideration and that the most pressing problem to be solved now was where to find food. The Prime Minister also answered other questions, stating that the government had not consulted with the Soviet Union regarding the situation in China, and that some members had asked whether, in view of the seriousness of this morning's news, Mr. Strang's mission to Moscow could be approved to supplement military talks with the Soviet Union as soon as possible. The Prime Minister replied that we must first reach an agreement. The Prime Minister finally answered a question stating that more than the usual number of British troops in North China are currently stationed in Tianjin. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The British Cabinet met at 10:30 AM this morning to study the international situation, with particular attention to British-Japanese relations in North China. However, apart from reviewing diplomatic reports from the Far East, the Cabinet made no decisions on actions. Before a formal response is received in Tokyo regarding the British proposal to negotiate the Tianjin incident as a local matter, no concrete decisions will be made. (21st Associated Press Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Press Comments on Tianjin Incident as an Act of Japanese Challenge</h3>
<p>(London) The Daily Mail today commented on the situation in Tianjin, stating that Britain now holds economic leverage, and that the Tianjin incident is an act of Japanese challenge, which is no different from the tactics of unrestricted submarine warfare, poison gas, tearing up treaties, and various other strategies used by a country in a state of serious defeat seeking to win victory. This kind of challenge cannot be compromised with and must be given an extremely firm and clear response. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Sir Archibald Sinclair, the British government's chief legal advisor, said at a Conservative Party meeting in Loughborough today that it was a mistake to say that the blockade of the Tianjin Concession did not threaten the heart of Britain. This threat was largely planned and instigated by those who consider the British Empire to be the greatest obstacle to their dominance of the world. Those who express the above opinions are largely misguided because their relatives and friends in Tianjin have suffered insults and dangers. The habit of Conservative tradition denies the deep conviction that Britain has not surrendered to the kind of threat it is currently facing, nor will it ever surrender. It can only stand strong at any cost. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Asahi Shimbun, the Japanese government has explicitly rejected the British government's protest regarding special discrimination against British nationals in Tianjin and the delayed inspection of food entering the British Concession. It is reported that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita informed British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie of the rejection yesterday, stating that the Japanese government now supports the attitude and policy plans taken by the Japanese military in Tianjin, and that if Britain does not change its attitude towards the new situation in East Asia, the Japanese government cannot comply with the British government's request. The reaction of various newspapers to the meeting between Arita and Craigie can be seen in the text of its headline. Today's Yomiuri Shimbun headline reads, "British Ambassador Begs for Forgiveness, Arita Gives Serious Warning, Demanding Recognition of the New Situation." The Kokumin Shimbun headline reads, "The Cunning Policy of Great Britain Has Been Broken by the Japanese Government." (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Protest Over Lun Chang Incident; Britain Has Not Yet Received a Response</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Butler stated in the House of Commons today that the British government's protest to the Japanese side regarding the injury and death of Mr. Dinkler, a British employee of the Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Pudong, has not yet been answered, which is regrettable. One member asked whether Mr. Butler had read the coroner's report detailing the cause of Mr. Dinkler's death and whether he would obtain immediate satisfaction for this unprecedented atrocity. Mr. Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax had read the coroner's report and was awaiting an official report. At that time, due attention would be paid to the extremely serious nature of this case. Another member asked the government whether it had expressed any sympathy to Mr. Dinkler's family, but Mr. Butler did not answer. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>US State Department to Publish Full Text of Protests Over Repeated Damage to US Property in China by Japanese Aircraft; Bombing Incidents Number Over 150</h3>
<p>(Washington) Mr. Dooman, the US Chargé d'Affaires in Tokyo, protested to the Japanese government yesterday over the continued bombing of American property in China by Japanese aircraft. Secretary of State Hull today confirmed that Mr. Dooman had visited the Japanese Foreign Ministry twice yesterday on the instructions of the State Department, the first time in connection with the current situation in Gulangyu and the second time in connection with the continued bombing of American property in China by Japanese aircraft. In addition to lodging a protest with the Japanese government regarding the bombing, Mr. Dooman also asked the Japanese government to agree to the publication of several US protests previously made on this issue. Mr. Hull also stated that, to his knowledge, Mr. Dooman's protest did not mention the situation in Tianjin. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The full text of the protests repeatedly made by the United States to Japan regarding the bombing of American property in China by Japanese aircraft will be published by the State Department within days. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, there have been more than 150 cases of American property in China being threatened or damaged by Japanese aircraft, of which more than 24 have occurred between June 1 of this year and the present.

<h3>Japanese Blockade of Tianjin Merely a Show of Force</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to Dr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, the Japanese blockade of Tianjin is purely a "show of force." Dr. Hu believes that the Japanese will eventually soften their stance and resolve the issue as a local incident. He further stated, "The Japanese are well aware that the war has continued for two years without an end in sight. They also understand that the whole world sympathizes with China, and that Britain, France, and the United States are all providing assistance to China. In order to end the war, the Japanese must shift their focus to Britain. If Britain yields, there will be no problem with other countries." (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) The "Ming Xing Evening News" has commented on the statement made by Secretary of State Hull yesterday regarding the Tianjin incident, stating that "Japan is taking advantage of the fact that Western European countries are too preoccupied to attend to other matters, and is actively creating its so-called 'New Order in East Asia.' The United States cannot stand idly by. Secretary of State Hull has issued the clearest warning to Japan on this point." (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>If the U.S. Strongly Intervenes, Japan Might Temper Its Arrogance</h3>
<p>(Paris) Responsible figures here are generally satisfied with the negotiations conducted by the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires to Japan, Mr. Dooman, with the Japanese Foreign Ministry, saying that as a result, the Tianjin incident may be resolved locally. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) U.S. Ambassador Johnson arrived here a week ago via Shanghai from the United States. It is now heard that if the Tianjin situation escalates to a serious extent, Mr. Johnson may soon return to Shanghai to maintain close contact with the latest developments. However, it is believed that he will remain in Chongqing for the time being. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, all the newspapers here state that the United States' concern over the Tianjin incident is far greater than generally reported. "Le Figaro" reports that the United States is now paying closer attention to the situation in Tianjin than most people imagine. After the end of the European War, Britain did not hesitate to sacrifice its alliance with Japan out of respect for and to reconcile with the United States. The United States will not forget this. "The Times" reports that the protest lodged by Washington with Tokyo is said to be worded extremely sternly. "Le Journal" states, "Our responsibility is quite simple: we should absolutely do our utmost to help our British friends." (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) Yesterday, diplomatic sources here told reporters, "Only strong intervention by the United States can force Japan to abandon all actions that damage the rights and interests of third parties in China. The attitude of the United States is also the decisive factor in resolving the Tianjin incident. If the United States adopts a policy of non-intervention, Japan will definitely take action against other foreign concessions in China." (Associated Press, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) Here, all developments in the Tianjin situation are still of great concern. French political circles attach great importance to the attitude of the U.S. government, saying that everything depends on the U.S. government. It is still hoped that the dispute can be resolved locally, but if it fails, Britain, France, and the United States should immediately take a firm stance. In the opinion of French figures, in addition to Tianjin, the diplomatic situation has become difficult. The final success of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations is now considered certain. The Franco-Soviet Pact is expected to be announced at the end of this week. General Pétain, the French Ambassador to Spain, has returned to Beijing from Burgos and has had lengthy discussions with Foreign Minister Bonnet regarding the situation in Spain. The guaranteed neutrality and independence of Spain are greatly welcomed here. The thorny issue of Spain's debt to France is expected to be resolved within a few days. Spain will then repatriate its refugees in France. There are many rumors regarding the movements of German troops in Bohemia, Moravia, and the Siegfried Line, but at present, no definite information has been received. It is impossible to determine whether these people are being used as scapegoats or whether they intend to exert pressure on their neighbors. (Reuter, 20th)</p>
<h3>Foreign Women and Children Leaving; Tianjin British Concession Business Groups Mobilized; Vegetable Shortage Persists</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Today, eighty foreign women and children left Tianjin on the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s "Xianghe" steamer. This is the first group of foreigners to leave Tianjin since the blockade of the concessions. After arriving in Tanggu, all the passengers will transfer to Jardine Matheson's "Wen Sheng" and Taikoo's "Shengjing" steamers to go to Qinhuangdao. When the "Xianghe" steamer passed through the Japanese inspection point at Dalian Wharf, it was not stopped. A radio message has now been received reporting that it arrived in Tanggu safely. The departure of this group of foreign women and children by steamer to various summer resorts was specially arranged to avoid possible difficulties or unpleasant incidents that might occur if they traveled by train. The climate in Tianjin has been very hot recently, and this measure is considered essential for children. The situation in Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe is quite peaceful, and the food supply is quite sufficient, but due to the prolonged drought, there is a severe shortage of drinking water. Last night, the business groups of the British Concession in Tianjin were ordered to mobilize for alert, so the tense situation has eased slightly. At present, the members of the group are all at the headquarters, ready to depart, but they have not yet been assigned to patrol the streets. The authorities have remained silent about the reasons for mobilizing the business groups, but some observers believe that this is related to the rumors that the Japanese have new intentions towards the British Concession, which were sparked by the Japanese relaxing the restrictions at the inspection points for one hour last night. The British Concession's business groups number over a hundred people, most of whom are British and Russian nationals. Nationals of other countries account for only a small minority. It is heard that an emergency auxiliary team, composed exclusively of British nationals, is now being organized. The team members will carry only batons and will not carry weapons or wear uniforms, but only armbands. These auxiliary team members have not yet been ordered to mobilize, but have registered with the British authorities so that they can be called up immediately in the event of an emergency. There are now rumors that undesirable elements may have infiltrated the concession. The British Municipal Council has sent a letter to the managers of various British commercial firms, urging them to encourage their employees to register to join the auxiliary team. Judging from the remarks made today by Mr. Ti Bo, the Chairman of the British Municipal Council, the Japanese plan to intimidate the council's employees has not produced the desired results so far. According to Mr. Ti Bo, only one of the council's 700 constables has resigned because he feared that his family living outside the concession would be persecuted. Although the business groups have been ordered to assemble, patrols in the British Concession are still being carried out by British troops. Concession constables are also performing special duties in various streets and at various entrances and exits. The residents of the concession do not believe the news published in a certain Japanese newspaper here that vegetable vendors held a meeting and decided to boycott the British Concession and only sell their products in Japanese-controlled areas. They believe that this is a habitual tactic of the Japanese to foreshadow new methods of dealing with the concession. The meaning is that the Japanese will redouble their efforts to intercept any small amount of vegetables entering the concession, so as to make the residents trapped in the concession feel even more unpleasant. The British escort vessel HMS Lowestoft (990 tons), which was originally scheduled to set sail this morning, is temporarily moored here, which is a great comfort to the people. The situation on the border of the British Concession is quite calm today. The number of Chinese people lining up waiting for inspection is very small. The situation in the vegetable markets in the concession is still extremely bleak. Only a small number of rotten vegetables and poultry are on sale. Other meats are completely absent. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received reporters today, he denied that there were any discriminatory actions against the British in front of the Japanese barriers in Tianjin. It is claimed that all nationals are treated equally, and dealt with according to the merits of the individual. Searches are necessary to confirm that the British are not carrying weapons or bombs. The Japanese military authorities, from a humanitarian point of view, "will naturally do their best to allow food and supplies to pass, but they must be searched." (Reuter, 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The anti-British movement in North China, instigated by the Japanese authorities and the Chinese puppet regime under Japanese control, continues to spread. It is reported that an anti-British mass meeting will be held in Beiping on Friday, and Japanese "reservists" will also participate. At the same time, various newspapers in this city under Japanese control are vehemently attacking Britain in every possible way. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A week has passed since the foreign concessions in Tianjin were subjected to extremely strict isolation. During this period, very little food has been allowed to enter the concessions. However, yesterday, a detachment of the British Royal Northumberland Fusiliers safely passed through the blockade line. A truck, guided by a detachment of the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, left the concession and entered the Japanese-controlled area, and returned with a large batch of vegetables from the countryside. These items are now severely lacking in the concession. Late last night, the members of the British Concession's business groups were ordered to prepare for immediate deployment. Since the arrival of HMS Sandwich (1045 tons), there have been two British warships here, the other being HMS Lowestoft (990 tons), which was originally scheduled to set sail today, but has now cancelled due to the tense situation here. The anti-British movement is still in full swing and shows no signs of abating. A recent development is that innkeepers in the Japanese-controlled area have posted notices requiring the British to leave the concession and stating that Chinese who leave the British Concession and stay in the inns will receive a 50% discount. The food situation in the British and French concessions is still very worrying. The Japanese are now focusing on the milk supply. The entry of milk into the concession is being completely blocked. The concession also feels a lack of coal. There is a large amount of coal stored in the Japanese-controlled area across the Baihe River, but the Japanese are preventing it from being transported into the concession. A British national, Mr. Smith, was detained by the Japanese on Saturday for arguing with a Chinese policeman, and has not yet been released. The British community is extremely resentful of this matter, especially the members of the Veterans of the European War Association, as Mr. Smith is also a member. The British Consul-General, Mr. Ramsom, has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese to urge his release, but has not been successful. The inspection in front of the barriers outside the concession was slightly relaxed today, reportedly due to the Dragon Boat Festival, but the British do not see this as a sign of a major improvement in the situation. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) "The Times" comments today that the situation in Tianjin remains chaotic due to the attempt by the Japanese military authorities in North China to turn a local accidental event into a dispute over general policy. The trends and objectives of Japan's China policy have long been uncertain. The future development of this dispute is highly speculative. The recent remarks made to the press by U.S. Secretary of State Hull indicate that the U.S. government, while not directly involved in the Tianjin dispute, is very concerned about the broadest aspects of the incident. The newspaper concludes by saying that the Tianjin incident itself is clearly a matter of direct concern to Britain and Japan, but its gradual unfolding into a general movement against foreign concessions and treaty rights in China will lead to an expansion of the scope of opposition to Japanese policy far beyond what the Japanese military may be able to comprehend.

<h3>U.S. Consul-General in Tianjin Protests to Tashiro</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The U.S. Consul-General in Tianjin, Mr. Goteway, today specifically lodged a protest with the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, Mr. Tashiro, regarding the Japanese interference in the actions of American nationals. In the letter of protest, the U.S. Consul listed various grievances and inconveniences suffered by American nationals in Tianjin, and stated that the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin concession not only caused great inconvenience to American nationals, but also caused great losses to American merchants. In addition, Admiral Yarnell, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, and U.S. Consul-General Goteway paid a return visit to the British Consul and military authorities in Tianjin. According to sources from the U.S. consulate, Admiral Yarnell discussed the Tianjin issue with the British side. At around 1:00 p.m., Admiral Yarnell went to Qinhuangdao to board his flagship, the USS Augusta. Furthermore, the British attitude has recently hardened. Regarding Mr. Smith, who was previously injured in the head by a puppet Chinese policeman using a pistol butt and is now being detained by the Japanese, the British side in Tianjin has lodged a "final demand" with the Japanese. In his "final demand," the British Consul-General in Tianjin stated that if Mr. Smith is not released immediately, this issue will no longer be a local incident and London will take appropriate steps.

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bombing Chongqing and Chengdu Damaged; 17 Aircraft Shot Down; Overseas Chinese Donate Aircraft for Combat Use</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a Chinese report today, as a result of the Japanese aircraft bombings of Chongqing and Chengdu on June 11, it has now been ascertained that the number of Japanese aircraft damaged by the Chinese side reached as many as seventeen. As for how many Japanese aircraft were destroyed in Chengdu, it is not yet possible to know completely. It is heard that the most famous achievements in the Chinese Air Force's combat record are mostly due to aircraft donated by overseas Chinese. For example, of the fifteen Chinese aircraft that fought with Japanese aircraft over Chongqing recently, most were purchased with funds donated by overseas Chinese. In recent air battles, no fewer than eight Japanese aircraft, each worth more than one million legal tender (Chinese currency), were shot down by overseas Chinese aircraft. It is heard that of these dozen or so overseas Chinese aircraft, two were donated by overseas Chinese in Cuba, three were donated by overseas Chinese in Burma, two were donated by overseas Chinese in Peru, one was donated by overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, three were donated by overseas Chinese in San Francisco, one was donated by overseas Chinese in New York, one was donated by overseas Chinese in Canada, and three were donated by the military and civilians of Guangdong. Furthermore, among these dozen or so overseas Chinese aircraft, the most glorious achievements were made by the "Siam No. 2" piloted by Huang Tianming (transliteration), the "New York" piloted by Liang Tiancheng (transliteration), and the "Canada" piloted by Zhou Jinshuo (transliteration), all of whom have shot down Japanese aircraft. It is heard that the names of most overseas Chinese aircraft are named after the country or place of donation. (Associated Press, 21st)</p>

<h3>Three-Power Anti-Aggression Agreement: Favorable Progress in Anglo-Soviet Negotiations, Britain Eager to Reach Compromise with Soviet Union, Soviet Union Denies Insistence on Guaranteeing the Far East</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the issue of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov is scheduled to continue talks with French Ambassador Naggiar, British Ambassador Seeds, and British Foreign Office Central European Department Director Strang at 6:00 PM today. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(London) Today, Reuters diplomatic correspondents stated that well-informed sources here have a more favorable view of the progress of the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's recent memorandum has been studied and finalized, and it is believed that the views of both sides are close to agreement. If there are no unexpected developments during the next meeting between the British and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union, British Foreign Office representative Strang, and Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov, both sides will indeed have a good opportunity to remove all differences of opinion in principle. If a compromise can be reached, it will be followed by drafting the details, which may take some time to complete. In short, well-informed sources are quite optimistic about the prospects. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Sources close to the government here recently declared that the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have now entered a decisive stage. The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic countries this morning and decided to accept France's proposal. In essence, if the vital interests of one of the three countries—Britain, France, and the Soviet Union—are threatened, the other two countries should provide mutual assistance. This proposal differs from the one proposed by Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov in only one respect: the Soviet Union insists that the names of the Baltic countries should be explicitly mentioned, while Britain and France suggest leaving them out. Since the Baltic countries have stated that they do not want to be guaranteed, it is not convenient to force them to accept it. Britain has therefore decided not to explicitly provide guarantees to those countries. The Soviet Union's sincerity in concluding an agreement can be seen in whether it accepts the new proposal from Britain and France. In addition to this, key issues such as the Soviet Union's request for immediate staff talks have been resolved. The British government has ordered its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, to speed up negotiations in the hope of reaching an agreement as soon as possible. According to reliable sources in Berlin and Moscow, Germany is using the bait of concluding a non-aggression pact, a trade agreement, and even a "Baltic Locarno" to induce the Soviet Union to maintain a neutral position. However, it is said that Hitler still harbors suspicions about the Soviet Union and has only allowed Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to try to break through the "Eastern European front" with diplomatic tactics. The proposals Germany has made to the Soviet Union are only informal. The Soviet Union has not yet expressed its position, except to put them on file. Because of all this, the British government is eager to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union to prevent Germany from reaping the benefits. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) German newspapers have recently published news that the Soviet government insisted on guaranteeing the Soviet Union's Far Eastern borders during negotiations with Britain and France, and that this claim is an obstacle to the conclusion of an agreement. TASS is authorized to declare that the above news is completely fabricated and has no basis in fact. (TASS dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers have recently reported that the Soviet Union once asked Britain to accept a guarantee clause in writing, so as to implement it in the event of war in the Far East. Although this statement has been denied by both British officials and the Soviet TASS news agency, the German News Agency still takes this as its word, adding the comment that Britain's own denial is not enough, and now it is inciting the Soviet government to issue a denial. It is said that German newspapers did not involve the words "guaranteeing the Soviet Far Eastern border," only saying that the Soviet Union asked Britain to accept in writing to provide assistance to the Soviet Union when the Soviet Union goes to war with Japan. As it is, Anglo-Soviet negotiations have reached a stalemate, and Anglo-Japanese relations have suddenly become tense due to the Tianjin incident. The difficulties encountered by British foreign policy are increasing day by day. "It must be known that Britain is unable to do anything about the Tianjin incident, how can it help the Soviet Union in the Far East?" (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Soviet Staff Talks Can Be Implemented As Soon As Agreement Is Reached, Prime Minister Chamberlain Answers Questions from Parliamentarians</h3>

Opposition Labour Party member Wedgwood then asked, "The news that came this morning is quite serious. I wonder if the Prime Minister can allow our staff to conduct talks with the Soviet staff as soon as possible to supplement the mission of Strang, Director of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office." The Prime Minister immediately replied that this could only be implemented after the Anglo-Soviet agreement was concluded. Liberal Party member Mander asked if the Anglo-Franco-Soviet agreement was intended to be extended to the Far East, to which Foreign Secretary Butler replied in the negative.

The determination of the citizens of Danzig and their political beliefs have matured to date.

<h3>India's Population Soars, Food Becomes a Problem</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Indian Labor Representative Sir Nas, in his speech at the International Labor Conference yesterday, gave a detailed account of the Indian government's economic construction. According to him, the Indian government has achieved excellent results in the development of irrigation work and the improvement of soil and animal husbandry technology. The government pays attention to the food problem, but because of the large population, the increase in food is difficult to achieve significant results. It is predicted that within a few years, India's population may reach a huge number of 400 million, so various problems arise in how to maintain an appropriate standard of living for the people's diet and daily life. The Indian government is racking its brains on how to deal with it. (Haitong dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<h3>Chengdu Bombed by Japanese Planes, Chinese Air Force Shoots Down Three Japanese Planes, Heavy Damage to Civilian and Commercial Areas</h3>
<p>Chengdu Air News: The Japanese army began to bomb Chongqing on May 3. Following this, on the evening of the 11th of this month, 27 heavy bombers indiscriminately dropped explosive and incendiary bombs on civilian and commercial areas in Chengdu, attempting to destroy the city of Rong. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Alarm Sounded</p>
<p>The weather on the 10th was very clear, with a clear sky and no clouds. From the morning, people felt the danger of an air raid, and many people temporarily evacuated. At 5:30 PM, Chengdu received a report that 27 Japanese planes were flying west from Badong, Hubei, and appeared to be entering Sichuan. At 5:40 PM, another report was received that three groups of Japanese planes, each with 27 planes, were spotted somewhere. Two groups passed through the territory of Fengjie and Kaijiang counties, and one group continued to fly west. Chengdu then issued a preliminary warning. At 6:30 PM, 27 Japanese planes passed over , and Chengdu issued an air raid warning. At 7:10 PM, Japanese planes passed over , and Chengdu issued an emergency warning. At 7:30 PM, 27 Japanese planes, in a single line, invaded the city's airspace from the northeast, indiscriminately dropping explosive and incendiary bombs in civilian residential and commercial areas, and then headed southeast . The alarm was lifted around 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>Fierce Air Combat</p>
<p>When the Japanese planes approached the city's airspace, several squadrons of the brave Chinese Air Force had already soared into the clouds, waiting in battle formation. When the 27 Japanese planes flew in, the Chinese Air Force immediately rushed to intercept them. The Japanese planes were panicked and dared not engage in battle. After dropping the bombs indiscriminately, they tried to escape. The Chinese Air Force tracked and pursued them, and a fierce air battle broke out in the southeast of the city. The Chinese Air Force bravely chased and killed them, rushing into the Japanese fire net, attacking back and forth, and often shooting down three Japanese planes. After chasing for a considerable distance, the Chinese air squadron safely returned to defense.</p>
<p>Blood Feuds and Fires of Hate</p>
<p>The Japanese planes indiscriminately dropped explosive and incendiary bombs in this attack on Chengdu. Many places in Yanshi Intersection and streets caught fire. These areas are all civilian residential and commercial areas and have no military significance. West China University, which is run by foreigners, was also bombed, and Mrs. Li, the president of the Baptist Church, was injured. Flames soared in the disaster area, and corpses and flesh flew everywhere. On the tops of walls and under telegraph poles, severed limbs were still bleeding. Women and children who were crushed and injured were crying in the fire. A young woman, holding her child with a broken arm and abdomen, sat in the blood and fire, crying and calling for revenge. In the smoke and flames, the old, weak, women, and children cried in each other's arms, watching their property burn to ashes. They were homeless. The fierce flames and poisonous fire burned until 3:00 AM on the 12th before being extinguished. Countless houses in the disaster area were turned into rubble. At 7:30 PM that night, when the Japanese planes indiscriminately bombed and the fire reached the sky, fire-fighting teams and paramedics rushed into the area to risk their lives to put out the fire and rescue people. The carrying teams, dismantling teams, investigation teams, comfort teams, rescue teams, and patrol teams all worked in an orderly manner, rescuing the injured, suppressing the fire, dismantling houses, and guarding the belongings of the citizens, staying up all night, fully demonstrating a tight organization. Huang Shebo, a brave company commander, and more than 20 soldiers were directing traffic outside Xiaomen when they were hit by bullets and injured. Several female workers from the provincial party headquarters were burned beyond recognition while rescuing refugee children.</p>

<p>Emergency Relief</p>
<p>Regarding the follow-up work such as relief and burial, the party, government, military agencies, and various rescue organizations were still actively working as of the evening of the 12th. The party, government, and military convened an emergency joint meeting on the afternoon of the 12th and resolved that the protection teams, rural service teams, military control, and military camp contingents should be responsible for actively sweeping the rubble on the streets, filling in the bomb damage, and moving the unexploded bombs. The municipal government and the Highway Bureau should control vehicles and strictly prohibit raising prices to facilitate evacuation and inform the merchants to immediately evacuate goods to the countryside to preserve material resources. Shelters were set up for the victims who were homeless. The injured were rushed for treatment, and the dead were quickly buried. Yang Quanyu, the mayor of Chengdu, and Yan Xiaohu, the garrison commander who were training somewhere, have returned to Chengdu on special leave to handle the aftermath and relief work. The bereaved families of the dead will be compensated with 30 yuan, the seriously injured will be compensated with 20 yuan, and the slightly injured will be compensated with 5 to 10 yuan. From the 12th, funds have been allocated by the Central Relief Committee and will be handled by the Chengdu Emergency Relief Joint Office. The dead who are unclaimed have been buried by the government with coffins. The Chengdu Municipal Government has formed two major teams of disaster area workers.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 12th, they went to the disaster area to conduct investigations and condolences, and sent personnel to the four major hospitals of Chengdu Fucheng, Cunren, and Shensici Ping'an Bridge Beimen Catholic Church to express condolences to the injured people, investigating the dead and victims. All street lights and streets were completely restored to order on the evening of the 12th.</p>
<p>Active Construction</p>
<p>Since the government actively carried out evacuation, the countryside in each evacuation area began to prosper. Many working people are rushing to build houses there. After the air raid on the 11th, thousands of citizens, young and old, moved to the countryside overnight. Young men and women are scattered in bamboo forests and rice paddies. In small thatched cottages, modern small restaurants are open. The songs of resistance against the war echo in the green waves of rice seedlings. The countryside is actively building and rapidly prospering. (June 12)</p>

The ships fired remotely, using shells to indicate targets. The motorboats were full of Japanese soldiers. When they rushed close to Gezhoushan Bay, the seabed was full of reefs, and the Japanese boats could not get close. They opened machine guns and bombarded the rocks. The Chinese army also returned fire with guns and cannons. Until the 14th morning, five or six Japanese boats were sunk, and many Japanese soldiers drowned and became food for sharks. The residents of Shantou heard the gunshots very clearly. If the Japanese army had succeeded in landing in Gezhou and Dahu, there would have been a fierce battle. That night, the women and children of the coastal villages mostly climbed mountains to Jiaoshi to take refuge in the dark and rain. On the morning of the 14th, the fighting did not stop. Foreign ships temporarily stopped entering and leaving. The authorities stepped up the forced evacuation of the people and managed the teams (that is, the citizens were formed) with military laws, and controlled food and ships. It is expected that the battle of Shantou will start near the shore at any moment. Also, before dawn on the 14th, an air raid alarm was issued. Men, women, old and young left the city in panic amid cries of alarm. According to rumors in the city, the Japanese army plans to take advantage of the rising Han River water to invade Meipu and use rubber boats to penetrate deep above Songkou. The authorities issued announcements to reassure the people to avoid panic.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Traitors Fight Each Other</h3>
<p>Replacement of Puppet Police Chief</p>
<p>Hangzhou Communication: Chen Bingjun, the puppet police chief of Zhejiang Province, and the puppet governor of Zhejiang Province were at odds with each other. He then made an excuse to transfer Chen elsewhere and replaced him with Wu Hong, the former puppet guard section chief and acting chief. Chen was very unwilling and sneaked to Nanjing, to the puppet pacification department secretary Liang Xiaocheng (Liang Hongzhi's son), pointing out the various acts of transgression by Zai. Liang suddenly dismissed Wu and replaced him with Shang Rongzhou. Shang has come to Hangzhou to take office. Their struggle for power and profit is evident. Gangs of thieves are as numerous as hair in the downtown areas of the city.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Japanese Army Induces Ignorant Young People</h3>
<p>Gangs of Thieves as Numerous as Hair in the Downtown Areas of the City</p>
<p>Wuxi Communication: The Japanese army suffered military defeats on the front line, with many deaths and injuries, and it was extremely difficult to replenish them. They had no choice but to forcibly conscript young men from the occupied areas and press them to fight on the front lines. Among the young people who were forcibly conscripted in Wuxi were the clerks of mountain goods shops. Recently, they formed the so-called "Anti-Communist Youth League," using all kinds of inducements to get ignorant teenagers to join, engaging in training and military activities. However, very few people joined. Robberies have occurred in the city for days, and residents are uneasy. On the afternoon of the 16th, Xu Zeng, a woman from Nanzha Township, Jiangyin, received 80 yuan for silkworm cocoons at the "Silk Cocoon Office" in the city, packed it in a shoe box, and wanted to take a small steamer back to her hometown. Passing through Guangfu Gate Taiping Bridge, she was robbed by three robbers. Also, at the HuaCheng oil company at Changan Bridge, at 9:00 PM, it was also robbed, losing two or three hundred yuan. Gangs of thieves are as numerous as hair in the city and the countryside, and the Japanese puppets have difficulty coping with them.</p>
<h3>Kunshan's Opium and Gambling Are Rampant</h3>
<p>Kunshan Communication: Under the rule of the puppet organization, opium and gambling are extremely prevalent in Kunshan. The puppet opium suppression director is Gao Jixian, who uses opium suppression as a name to sell opium in reality. Therefore, opium dens are lined up in the city, and business is booming. All those who open opium dens must pay donations. The donation rate is divided into three types: A, B, and C. Type A is 30 yuan per month, Type B is 20 yuan per month, and Type C is 10 yuan per month. Opium addicts must also register with the puppet bureau. If they are found smoking privately without a certificate, they will be severely fined. Therefore, the puppet bureau's income is very high. The gambling hall is presided over by a rogue. The puppet police do not interfere because they have subsidies. Ordinary ignorant farmers flock to it. The other day, Jin Zhixi, a villager from Jing Village outside the North Gate, because he was repeatedly defeated, threw all the hard work he had earned in a year into the gambling hall, and committed suicide out of anger. The intensity of its harm can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: After the Kunshan communication in your newspaper on the 19th was published, the members of our association and fellow villagers inquired about the situation from our association. Our association sent personnel to investigate. Now, the fellow villagers who came to Shanghai from Pinghu on the 19th have proven that there is no such thing. However, it is true that the people are ashamed and humiliated under violence because of their lives. We are hereby sending this letter to your newspaper, hoping that you will publish this letter as a correction. We are extremely grateful for your fairness. Sincerely, Pinghu Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, June 21.</p>
<h3>U.S. Ambassador Travels Through Yunnan to Chongqing; American People Sympathetic to China's Resistance; Ambassador Praises Yunnan-Burma Road Project</h3>
<p>Kunming Air Dispatch: U.S. Ambassador Johnson, returning from the U.S. to his post, passed through Yunnan on his way to Chongqing and arrived in Yunnan on the 7th of this month. According to the ambassador, "The American people are extremely sympathetic to China's resistance and believe that victory will ultimately belong to China." He also mentioned that on his previous trip back to the U.S., he took the Yunnan-Burma Road. He said that the Yunnan-Burma Road project was vast, similar to the Panama Canal project in the U.S. The Chinese government was able to complete this great project in a short period, and it is said that the road construction did not use machinery but relied purely on manual labor, which shows the people's perseverance and hard-working nature, which is unmatched elsewhere, and is truly admirable. However, it is inevitable that collapses will occur during rainy weather. It is hoped that the spirit of road construction will be maintained to repair it at any time to keep it unobstructed, which will greatly benefit transportation. On the afternoon of the 8th, the ambassador went to the provincial government to meet with Chairman Long, and they had a pleasant conversation. At 4 p.m. on the 9th, 16 groups from the Provincial National Diplomacy Association welcomed the ambassador at Yunnan University, with more than 200 people attending. On the 11th, the ambassador set off by car from Guizhou to Chongqing.</p>

<p>(Chongqing Special Dispatch) The three provinces of Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou are the rear of China's resistance. Since the start of the war, the authorities of the three provinces have worked hard on political reform and economic construction. As for education, there has also been considerable progress. In order to understand the implementation of education in the three provinces, the Ministry of Education sent special personnel to inspect various types of education. On May 2nd, Chen Lijiang, Director of the Social Education Department of the Ministry of Education, was ordered to go to inspect wartime people's education in the three provinces. After receiving the order, Chen first went to Guiyang and after inspecting for several days, drove to Guangxi, first to Guilin, then to Liuzhou, Nanning, Wuming, Baise, Longzhou and other places, specializing in inspecting the implementation of adult education. After spending more than ten days, he went to Kunming, Yunnan for inspection. Now he has returned to Chongqing after the public business. According to him, wartime people's education in Yunnan and Guizhou is being actively promoted and will soon show results. As for Guangxi, I personally went to inspect all the important counties in the province and witnessed the enthusiasm of out-of-school adults entering school, their diligence in studying, and the determination and effective supervision of the authorities, as well as the resolute enforcement of laws and regulations forcing people to enter school, which is exciting. It is expected that illiteracy in the province will be completely eliminated as scheduled, which can be reported to the people of the country. It is deeply hoped that this spirit can influence the whole country. If all provinces can also catch up quickly and thoroughly promote wartime people's education, it will be of great benefit to the resistance and national reconstruction.</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Exports Over the Past Year; Reason to Celebrate the Future of Chinese Silk; Such Achievements Amidst Hardship and Adversity Prove That Self-Reliance is Not Difficult</h3>
<p>In the more than 20 months since the war, Shanghai's export situation, from June 27 to May 28, has shown considerable progress. On the one hand, this is due to the tense global silk production and sales relationship, which stimulated the rise in silk prices; on the other hand, the amazing efforts of the Chinese silk industry subjectively are also the most important factor. Looking at the almost complete destruction of silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang after the war, as well as the re-emergence of silk factories in Shanghai after the war shifted westward, and the almost year-round day and night operation of all newly opened silk factories in this term, the fewer production tools were able to obtain a large amount of labor results. On the one hand, this is one of the reasons why all silk factories have obtained more profits, but on the other hand, at the time of survival and extinction, Chinese silk can still meet the needs of foreign countries to a considerable extent, so that "Shanghai silk," which was on the verge of bankruptcy after the war, can still circulate in the international market. This is truly the greatest contribution of both labor and management in the Shanghai silk industry in these 12 months. The details of Shanghai's silk exports over the past year are specially investigated and listed in the table below, with the total export volume of the past three years attached for comparison:</p>
<p>Statistics of Shanghai's silk exports over the past year (unit: picul) Looking at the table above, in the first year of Shanghai's silk exports after the war, the exports to Europe fell by 10,565 piculs compared to the previous year, the exports to Asia fell by 4,960 piculs, and the exports to the United States fell by 17,688 piculs. In the first year of the war, Shanghai's total silk exports fell by 32,213 piculs compared to the previous year. If the silk price is 1,000 yuan per bundle, the silk exports affected by the war that year should be over 32 million yuan. However, in the last year (June 1, 27 to May 31, 28), the phenomenon of the revival of the Chinese silk industry in Shanghai is deeply gratifying. Its performance in exports has jumped out of the war by onefold in the first year, with 19,169 piculs transported to the United States, 12,713 piculs transported to Europe, and 5,714 piculs transported to Asia and Africa, totaling 37,596 piculs. Although this figure is far below the pre-war level, this point is enough to establish our confidence in self-reliance and regeneration, and enough to guarantee that Chinese silk will dominate the world market when the final victory comes.

<h3>Finance: Pure Gold Down Slightly; Ornamental Gold Still at Original Price</h3>
<p>Spot red market situation: Due to the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, business was suspended, and most of the money exchange shops were also closed. No transactions were heard outside the spot market.</p>
<p>The jewelry stores are still open as usual. The selling price of jewelry gold per tael is still 270 yuan for Datong Bank, 268 yuan for Xin Bank, and 262 yuan for purchases.</p>
<p>The Central Bank was open as usual yesterday. Upon receiving a London telegram on the 20th, the British pure gold fell slightly by a half penny, and the price per ounce fell to £7 8 shillings 5.5 pence, causing the bank's purchase price of Chinese pure gold to fall to 1,211.9 yuan. The listed customs gold is still 2.396 yuan, and the Shanghai standard gold price is 40 cents lower, at 1,207.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Large Bars Shrink Sharply; Indian Silver Falls Again</h3>
<p>According to London Telegram on the 20th, silver market conditions: The Indian and speculators sold out, and there was a lack of maintenance. The market was weak. After closing, it was stable and hard. Indian and American merchants bought at a higher price of 0.0625 at the listed price, but the seller's supply was very weak. The recent large silver bars have shrunk sharply by half a penny, and the forward ones have fallen sharply by 4.375. Also, New York Telegram, American Silver is as solid as ever. Also, Bombay Telegram, Indian silver market conditions are still weak. Both current and futures have continued to fall by five annas.</p>
<p>Also, Reuters London, June 21: The price of silver fell sharply for a long time today. The spot price per ounce is fixed at 19 pence 125, while yesterday it was 19 pence 625. This definite price cut is not purely accidental. The reason is that most people are hesitant about the US Treasury Department's policy of buying foreign silver after the end of June, which caused panic. It is heard that the market is currently lacking buyers, and there are speculative sales and many liquidations, causing the market to be unduly and heavily affected. News and communications from all walks of life expect that the unstable situation will continue until the US Treasury Department makes a decision. Today's price changes may reflect many rumors about this matter.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Flower: About 8,000 Pieces of Cotton Yarn Will Be Released Soon</h3>
<p>Since the tightening of foreign exchange in the yarn market, speculators in the market have been active, resulting in a sharp increase in the number of buying and selling chips. The market situation is unpredictable and difficult to grasp. After investigating the inside story of transactions in the market, some bulls have slightly emerged. However, the amount absorbed by the gold industry and the securities industry is in and out from time to time. Therefore, the waves are surging, and the majority of sentiment is still bullish. However, with the tightening of silver, the financial community has said that discounts on commodity mortgages will be reduced. If implemented, the buying trend may be slightly curbed. Recently, the factories have released a total of seven or eight thousand packages of coarse and fine yarn. The production of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in other factories is also becoming increasingly busy.</p>
<p>As for the cotton situation, the situation of local cotton is not worth mentioning in a bad environment. However, foreign cotton has risen a lot due to the impact of exchange rate contraction. However, its corner has always been in a hovering state, without great expansion. Items with "　" in the table have no definite guarantee.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Landed in Swatow - Information from the Shipping Industry - Suiyang Wheel Detained Passing Swatow, Unclear Where Japanese Troops Landed - Two British Vessels Sail to Swatow as Usual Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, this city spread news of Japanese troops landing near Swatow, but according to the shipping industry, as of yesterday evening, there was no confirmed information. Although various evening newspapers have special dispatches from Hong Kong and Reuters reports confirming it, the name of the place where the Japanese troops landed is unknown. The following is a record of the information obtained by shipping merchants in this city yesterday:</p>
<p>Suiyang Did Not Dock Passing Swatow</p>
<p>The British vessel Suiyang left Shanghai at 10:30 a.m. on the 18th, carrying goods to Swatow and Hong Kong. It arrived in Swatow on the evening of the 20th (the day before yesterday). When it attempted to enter the port to unload goods at dawn yesterday morning, it was dissuaded by a certain party, so it stopped entering the port and sailed directly to Hong Kong. It also telegraphed the Shanghai office to report. Because the telegram was brief and the truth was unclear, the Shanghai office sent a telegram to inquire. In the morning, it received a reply from the vessel, roughly stating that Japanese troops had landed near Swatow, and it was prevented from entering, so it went directly to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Concentrated Outside Swatow</p>
<p>After learning of the Suiyang vessel's news yesterday morning, the British shipping company found that its New Yisheng vessel also left Shanghai at 11:00 a.m. on the 18th for Swatow and the coastal defense of Hong Kong. It was estimated to be in Swatow as well. Why was the situation in Swatow so severe that the vessel had no telegram to report? So, at 9:15 a.m. yesterday morning, it sent a telegram to the Swatow branch to inquire. At 11:40 a.m., it received a reply from the Swatow office, only stating that there were many Japanese warships outside the port and that the city was still peaceful. There was no mention of Japanese troops landing, nor was there any advice to stop loading and unloading goods.</p>
<p>Desheng and Zesheng Enter the Port as Usual</p>
<p>The company has two vessels, Desheng and Zesheng, sailing to South China today, also to Swatow and Hong Kong. Although there was news of Japanese troops landing in this city yesterday, the Swatow branch's reply was still peaceful. Therefore, passengers and goods were loaded as usual yesterday, but passengers were notified that goods would be loaded as usual. If an incident occurred in Swatow, the goods would be taken to Hong Kong. According to the office, as of 6:00 p.m. yesterday afternoon, there was no news of changes in Swatow. Therefore, the two vessels will depart for Swatow at 2:30 p.m. today according to the scheduled sailing time. Moreover, both vessels have wireless equipment and can send telegrams at any time.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Tianjin Freight Transportation Has Been Smooth</h3>
<p>Dingsheng Telegraphed That It Arrived in Tianjin Yesterday Morning - Hengsheng Carries Goods North Today - The British and French Concessions in Tianjin Have Been Blockaded by the Japanese Army for Nine Days Now. British Vessels Going to Tianjin in This City Once Stopped Loading Goods. Later, Seeing the Risheng and Shuntian Vessels Arrive in Tianjin Without Being Searched, the Situation Was Slightly More Relaxed. Therefore, the Hunan and Guisheng Vessels Going to Tianjin the Day Before Yesterday Have Resumed Freight Transportation, as Reported in the Previous Newspaper. It Is Now Known That the Jardine Matheson's Dingsheng Vessel, Which Left Shanghai for Tianjin at 1:00 p.m. on the 15th, Arrived in Tanggu at 5:00 a.m. Yesterday (the 21st). The Vessel Telegraphed Yesterday Morning, Stating That Once the Tanggu Flour Is Unloaded, It Will Sail to the Tianjin Wharf. It Is Reported That Although the Vessel Did Not Load Goods When Going to Tianjin, It Carried 200 Tons of Foreign Goods from a Hong Kong Shipping Company to Tianjin, So It Must Go to Tianjin to Unload. After Unloading, It Will Come to Shanghai from Tianjin Tomorrow, Estimated to Arrive in Shanghai on the 28th. Today, the Company Has Another Hengsheng Vessel Continuing to Load Goods for Transportation to Tianjin. Therefore, Shipping in the Tianjin Concessions Has Been Smooth.</p>
<h3>Counselor of the German Embassy Transferred to Shanghai Consulate</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 21st - Fischer, Counselor of the German Embassy in China, has been in charge of embassy affairs since Ambassador Trautmann returned to Germany. He has recently been ordered to be transferred to the Consul General in Shanghai. Before Ambassador Tao returns to office, he will be replaced by Altenburg, the German Consul General in Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Two Concessions Make Efforts in Safety Campaign</h3>
<p>Eliminating Vendors and Beggars Along the Way to Avoid Obstruction and Accidents</p>
<p>The Safety Campaign Publicity Week initiated by the Public Concession's Public Works Department began on the 18th. Yesterday was the fourth day, and all work was proceeding as usual. However, the police departments of the two concessions believed that sidewalk vendors, street vendors selling vegetables, and beggars were disrupting traffic and hindering the safety campaign. Because these vendors block sidewalks or roads, vehicles and pedestrians often violate regulations. Therefore, yesterday, they dispatched personnel to various roads to correct licensed vendors. Those without licenses were all banned, and beggars were arrested to ensure smooth traffic. Since the implementation of the road traffic regulations in the two concessions, citizens have been able to comply with the instructions of the patrol officers, so the order is well maintained.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Leaflets Found in the Bund and Yangshupu - Criticizing the Japanese Side for Disrupting China's Financial System - Accusing "Huaxing" of Exchanging Legal Tender with Waste Paper</h3>
<p>Dabaoyun, on Sunday, someone distributed a large number of anti-Japanese leaflets called "To the Chinese People" in the Bund and the western district of Yangshupu, vehemently criticizing the Japanese side's attempt to disrupt China's financial system. The signatory was "Those Who Hope to Help You." After the leaflets were issued, a large team of Japanese military police</p>
<p>Immediately Blocked</p>
<p>All nearby passages, searching pedestrians and vehicles. One part of the leaflet stated that your blood enemies and quasi-traitors have now organized the so-called "Huaxing Bank," whose purpose is to destroy your monetary system and use the waste paper they issue to exchange for your legal tender.</p>
<p>Accepting Counterfeit Money</p>
<p>Is tantamount to shooting your own front-line warriors, is no different from piercing your heart with an arrow, is like digging your ancestral grave, and is even like allowing your wives and daughters to live as slaves under the oppression of the enemy. Uniform Collection of Sand and Gravel Import Duties.</p>
<p>37.5 Cents Per Ton Must Be Paid in One Go at the Wusong Estuary. Since the outbreak of the war, the Shanghai Sand and Gravel Association, after the Wusong Estuary branch of the customs was suspended, all sand and gravel transported to Shanghai was taxed by the customs after being transferred to the Suzhou River. Now that the Wusong Estuary branch has been restored, sand and gravel duties are collected as usual, at the rate of 37.5 cents per ton. The Shanghai Sand and Gravel Association has noted that the customs branch at the Wusong Estuary has resumed taxation. However, all sand and gravel, once transported to the Suzhou River, will still be taxed as before. The association believes that the matter concerns the burden on the industry and that it is necessary to request the customs to collect taxes uniformly. It jointly sent a letter to Mr. Luo Fude, the Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, with the Fishing Boat Sand Transport Industry Association, requesting him to order the uniform collection of sand and gravel duties. Previously, the Jianghai Customs replied to the two associations, agreeing to follow the request. It is now known that the relevant duty has been stipulated by the Jianghai Customs authorities as follows: (1) Those who have already collected duties at the Wusong Estuary branch will not be taxed again after being transferred to the Suzhou River; (2) It is stipulated that the duty for each ton of sand and gravel is 37.5 cents, which must be paid in one go at the Wusong Estuary branch; (3) If the same incident occurs again in the future, it can be reported to the customs for exemption from taxation. The Jianghai Customs has notified the tax police of the Wusong Estuary and Suzhou River branches, along with the measures.</p>
<p>Ningbo Fellow Association Asks to Restore Shanghai-Ningbo Passengers</p>
<p>For the convenience of fellow villagers, the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai has sent telegrams to President Chiang, Governor Gu and Commanders Liu of Zhejiang Province, Chairman Huang, and Commander Guo of the Ningbo Defense Department, requesting permission to restore passenger transport between Shanghai and Ningbo. The telegrams have recently been sent.</p>
<h3>European Refugees Plan to Come to China to Open Up a New "Land of Happiness" - It is Heard that the National Government Will Allow This Plan to Be Implemented Under Certain Circumstances</h3>
<p>Disclosed by German Banker Bogras</p>
<p>The Mainland Newspaper Yun, German banker and industrialist Bogras, is currently discussing with senior officials of the Chinese government to open up a new "land of happiness" in China. Based on a well-organized economic system, it will accommodate 100,000 European refugees. Thus, the problem of homeless Jewish refugees may have a sign of possible solution. This news was disclosed by Bogras himself yesterday (the 20th) when he hosted a press conference at the Cathay Hotel. According to reports, the Chinese government allowed him to prepare for immigration to China by the Yunnan Provincial Government under certain circumstances. They have the right to reside and work, and enjoy government protection and the same rights and responsibilities as Chinese citizens. According to the written statement issued by Bogras, the outline of his plan is as follows:</p>
<p>Immigrants Must Have Sufficient Funds</p>
<p>All those who come to China must bring sufficient funds to cover food and accommodation for about one year. Part of this fund will be used to purchase materials necessary for resettlement and to open shops. In the first year or two, a committee and a cooperative bank will be organized by the heads of various immigration agencies around the world to handle food, accommodation, and commercial matters in accordance with the proposed economic system, and to provide training in preparation for self-reliance in the future when opportunities arise. Many senior officials of the Chinese government have agreed to this proposal in their personal capacity, and soon</p>
<p>The Most Difficult Economic Problem</p>
<p>At the same time, letters have been sent to the leaders of various immigration agencies around the world, seeking their opinions on this matter. The main difficulty that may be encountered before the implementation of this plan is the economic problem. However, if effectively organized, most immigrants can become self-sufficient within one or two years. In view of the fact that immigrants who want to go to various countries in the world are either not allowed to enter or feel extremely difficult when entering the country, this decisive opportunity should not be underestimated. There are many opportunities to engage in revival in a vast country, and the opportunities will be abundant after the end of the war.</p>
<p>Political Motives Vigorously Avoided</p>
<p>There are at least 500,000 people in the world who are eager to move to any place, but all matters related to this plan must not have political or secret motives. The immigration problem must be handled on an economic basis in order to be resolved. Bogras then answered reporters' questions, saying that prospectors must be carefully selected, and the most suitable jobs for those who colonize China are transportation, machinery, and chemistry. This plan will be applied not only to Jewish refugees, but also to any homeless person in the current situation, not limited to any particular religion, but it is absolutely not political in nature.</p>
<p>Use Immigrants to Develop Resources</p>
<p>Southwestern China has always been known for its hidden resources. If Europeans are transplanted, the Chinese government and the immigrants themselves will benefit from it. Bogras, the host of this plan, has visited the Far East several times in the past five years and is very concerned about the Jewish refugee issue.</p>
<h3>The Dragon Boat Festival Was Spent Peacefully - Smooth Settlement of Accounts in Various Industries - Although the Foreign Exchange Rate Rose, the Money Supply Was Not Tight - The Credit System Was Gradually Restored</h3>
<p>Loans Released Were Recovered on Schedule, with Very Few Bad Debts</p>
<p>Yesterday was the Dragon Boat Festival, and the silver and money industry and various industries and markets were closed. The finances were stable, and various industries passed the festival peacefully. Under abnormal development, various industries gradually resumed the credit system. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Silver and Money Industry Closed, Various Industries Closed</p>
<p>The members of the Silver and Money Industry Association, as well as the Exchange, Acceptance, and other establishments of the Market Preparation Treasury, took a day off for the Summer Festival. Various industries and markets, such as soybeans, rice, securities, cotton yarn, miscellaneous grains, flour, cash, sugar, and cotton cloth, were closed for a day for the Dragon Boat Festival. Most factories, firms, and companies were also closed to handle the settlement of accounts for the Dragon Boat Festival. The people of Shanghai could not avoid the custom, and calamus, artemisia, and zongzi (glutinous rice dumplings) were abundant in the market, becoming essential items for households. As for foreign banks, foreign firms, and institutions such as the Public Works Department and the Public Administration Bureau, they also stopped working as usual.</p>
<p>The Market Was Stable, and Prices Soared</p>
<p>The Shanghai financial market remained as stable as ever. Except for the interbank lending rate rising to 25%, other interest rates remained largely unchanged. In Shanghai, which is abnormally developed, funds are abundant and difficult to use. At the same time, the increase in population has led to speculative activities such as hoarding, which has caused prices to soar. Various industries can make profits. Therefore, for this year's Dragon Boat Festival, the accounts released by various industries can be recovered, and some of the previous old accounts can also be recovered. However, since the exchange rate has tightened, the price increase of foreign goods is expected by everyone, and most domestic goods have also announced price increases at the same time, which is very disheartening. Speculators can make a profit of 4% by using foreign exchange, and they flock to it, which increases the demand for legal tender. The discount rate for remittances and notes has soared, reaching 70 yuan per thousand yuan, an increase of 16 yuan compared to the previous few days. Merchants and the bourgeoisie have also purchased and hoarded goods in legal tender, attempting to manipulate the market and wait for a good price to sell. Therefore, the high prices of this Dragon Boat Festival are unprecedented in previous years.</p>
<p>Funds Are Needed, and Bad Debts Are Very Few</p>
<p>The population of Shanghai has surged, and the branch offices of various banks in the war zone have withdrawn to Shanghai and are operating as usual. Therefore, funds are concentrated, and deposits have increased. Because there is an excess of funds and narrow investment channels, speculative activities are flourishing. Recently, the prices have soared, and the purchase and hoarding of goods has become a way to make money. Therefore, deposits in various banks continue to decrease. Although various banks once increased the interest rate on mortgage loans to 8%, most of them have recently stopped accepting them, which shows that there is an excessive demand for funds and insufficient supply. Therefore, the phenomenon of excessive funds in recent years seems to have become a thing of the past. Banks and money shops have also recovered the released funds on schedule due to the abnormal development of various industries, with very few bad debts.</p>
<h3>A Japanese Plane Crashed and Was Completely Destroyed in the Suburbs of Yuhuan - Two Pilots, One Killed and One Captured - Japanese Warships Fired Dozens of Shots Afterwards</h3>
<p>Coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang have recently been attacked by Japanese aircraft from time to time. A few days ago, a Japanese reconnaissance plane in Dongtou (80 li away from Yuhuan County), which belongs to Yuhuan County, crashed due to damage to the aircraft's parts during the flight. When it landed, the fuselage was completely destroyed. One Japanese pilot was killed on the spot, and another Japanese pilot was captured by the Chinese defense forces and has been escorted to a certain place. After the Japanese plane crashed, a Japanese warship sailed to the sea off Yuhuan and fired dozens of shots at Dongtou, which landed in the wilderness. There was no loss to the local area.</p>

<h3>Maintaining People's Livelihood - Concessions Will Set New Rice Prices - Each Stone Will Be Increased to 21 Yuan First - Shanghai's Rice Stock is Sufficient, Citizens Need Not Worry</h3>
<p>The price of the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Market has soared, breaking the 22 yuan mark, which has a significant impact on the people's livelihood and social stability. Since representatives from various rice industry groups visited the concession authorities to suggest stabilizing rice prices and maintaining the people's livelihood, the authorities have taken measures, and there is sufficient stock. It is hoped that citizens need not worry. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Concessions Consider Setting New Price Limits</p>
<p>After receiving suggestions from rice industry groups, the Public Works Department of the Public Concession has taken measures after research and consideration. In addition to making every effort to maintain the people's livelihood within the concession and stabilize rice prices, the first step is to lower rice prices to a certain new price limit, which is said to be 21 yuan per stone. It is also believed that Shanghai's rice stock is still sufficient, and the source remains uninterrupted. The entire concession will not lack food, so it is hoped that citizens will remain calm and need not worry. It is considered unnecessary to order foreign rice to be transported to Shanghai for relief.</p>
<p>The Management Committee Is Scheduled to Meet Today</p>
<p>The Management Committee of the Soybean and Rice Market has scheduled to invite 105 firms in the market at 3:00 p.m. today to persuade them to take the overall situation into account and not to speculate on rice in order to maintain the food supply for the people of Shanghai and suppress rice prices. The market was also closed for two days starting yesterday to handle the settlement of accounts for the Dragon Boat Festival, and trading will resume on the 23rd. It is hoped that the market will be able to open after the Dragon Boat Festival, so that rice prices can fall back to within 21 yuan, and hoarders will no longer engage in speculative transactions. At the same time, it is hoped that various firms will advise hoarders that it is easy to breed mold and insects during the yellow plum season, and it is not advisable to hoard any more.</p>
<p>Shanghai Has a Stock of 600,000 Bags of Rice</p>
<p>The food supply for the people of this city is extremely abundant. According to a survey by the Soybean and Rice Industry Association, last week, the rice stocks in various rice warehouses still had 523,822 bags. However, this is only the total number of rice stocks in various rice warehouses. The number of rice sold by rice shops and rice purchased and hoarded by citizens is certainly not small. According to estimates from the rice industry, it amounts to as many as 500,000 to 600,000 bags. Therefore, there is absolutely no fear of food shortages in this city. However, the soaring rice prices recently are due to the Tianjin and Gulangyu incidents, which have prompted citizens to purchase and hoard, and the number of rice shops has doubled. Since foreign exchange has tightened, the foreign rice ordered from Saigon cannot be transported to Shanghai for relief. The above two are the speculative opportunities for unscrupulous merchants, and they are also the two major reasons for the high rice prices.</p>
<p>Every Effort Is Being Made to Dredge the Source of Domestic Rice</p>
<p>In addition to suggesting that the concession authorities find ways to suppress rice prices and dispatch personnel to assist in maintaining market order, etc., various rice industry groups have now agreed to the suggestions of the concession authorities. However, the leaders of various rice industry groups believe that in order to stabilize rice prices, it is first necessary to dredge the source in order to increase stocks, so that rice prices can fall back. It is said that the method will be proposed at the meeting of the Market Management Committee at 3:00 p.m. today. It is heard that the number of domestic rice being transported to Shanghai from various rice-producing areas has been increasing recently, but the various shipping merchants are no longer working as hard as they used to because there is no profit to be made. Yesterday, the various shipping merchants took a day off as usual due to the lunar Dragon Boat Festival, so there were no rice boats transported to Shanghai yesterday. They will continue to collect and transport rice starting today.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Enter Concessions Must Be Inspected</h3>
<p>English Army performed its duties on the Daxilu.</p>
<p>At 10:30 a.m. on the day before yesterday, a Japanese military truck carrying more than a dozen fully armed Japanese soldiers entered the concession from Daxilu in western Shanghai. After crossing the boundary line guarded by the British army, it was suddenly chased back by the British army and ordered to stop. The Japanese army had no choice but to stop the vehicle, and the British army carried out strict inspections. Although the Japanese soldiers on the vehicle showed displeasure, there were no other actions, so fortunately, no accident occurred. It is heard that Japanese military vehicles entering the concession in the future must go through the British army's inspection procedures.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Post Office Burnt Down</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration received a telegram from the Yunnan Provincial Postal Administration yesterday, stating that the bureau suffered a fire last month due to careless handling of fire, and all packages, letters, vouchers, and orders were burnt down. Please notify the senders to quickly fill in a duplicate order for verification. It is now known that the Shanghai Postal Administration, after receiving the telegram, will issue a notice today due to the urgency of the matter, hoping that the senders will fill in the duplicate orders and send them to the bureau.</p>
<h3>Savings Movement Appeals: All Industries Should Curb Prices, Consider the Livelihoods of Ordinary People, and Stabilize Order; Simultaneously, Advise Citizens to Practice Thrift</h3>
<p>The city's Savings Movement Committee, deeply concerned about the continuous rise in prices and the unabated inflation that has caused great panic among the livelihoods of ordinary people, yesterday issued a special article appealing to all industries to consider the overall situation and promptly curb prices. At the same time, they advised citizens to practice thrift and overcome the difficulties together. The following is a breakdown:</p>
<p>Appeal to All Industries to Curb Prices</p>
<p>Since Shanghai became an isolated island, due to the obstruction of transportation from the interior and the inconvenience of cargo transport, coupled with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the prices of all goods have risen sharply, nearly doubling compared to before the war. Ordinary salaried classes and working-class laborers find it difficult to make ends meet with their monthly income, and the feeling that "life in Shanghai is increasingly difficult" is now even stronger. Recently, due to the tightening of foreign exchange, industries such as hardware, coal, Western medicine, woolens, and leather have successively announced price increases, with some rising by 30% to 50% or even more than 100%. Industries unrelated to foreign exchange have also taken the opportunity to raise prices. Some rice merchants even dared to manipulate the market and hoard goods, fueling inflation. Such actions, which only consider one's own interests and threaten the livelihoods of ordinary people, are extremely wrong. All sectors of the city are deeply concerned about this, believing that the continued soaring of prices will exacerbate social problems and have a detrimental impact on local order and public safety. Even the industries themselves will suffer. The Committee feels a sense of crisis and cannot remain silent. Therefore, it sincerely appeals to the leaders of all industries to take immediate measures to curb inflation. Profitable manufacturers should consider the overall situation and not raise prices rashly. Even if cost increases make it unavoidable, there should be a reasonable limit to prevent prices from becoming excessively high. In these extraordinary times, maintaining order in the rear is the duty that we should fulfill. It is hoped that all industries will share the difficulties and overcome them together. The residents of the isolated island will offer sincere prayers.</p>
<p>Advise Citizens to Practice Thrift</p>
<p>Due to the tightening of foreign exchange, various industries in Shanghai have again raised prices, causing distress in daily life. The price of rice is like pearls, and firewood is like cinnamon, making it difficult to sustain meals. The lives of residents in the isolated island are already severely threatened. However, there are still many people who indulge in extravagant lifestyles, spending fortunes on entertainment without hesitation, seemingly unaware that if the nation falls, where will they find refuge? Even those with wealth may find themselves impoverished. Moreover, the war is prolonged and without end. Future hardships are unpredictable. We should emulate the perseverance and determination of the past and start practicing thrift from now on. In this time of rising prices, save wherever possible. By reducing extravagance and contributing to the country and helping disaster victims, you will have peace of mind and a sense of security. Saving resources is cultivating national strength; saving the country is saving oneself. As for ordinary people, they should understand the difficulty of obtaining resources, discard vanity, and abandon extravagant habits to make their lives simpler. Only in this way can we overcome the difficulties. The future is long, and the hardships are intense. Fellow compatriots on the isolated island, let us encourage each other.</p>

The committee resumed its inquiry on the USS Ward yesterday morning (June 21st). It was found that the USS Barker, along with three other destroyers, set sail from Shanghai to Qingdao on Sunday.</p>
<p>Near Wusong Donggou</p>
<p>The bow of the warship collided with a Chinese sailboat that was crossing the river, splitting the sailboat into two. The people on board were rescued by nearby sampans. The sailboat was crossing the river towards Shanghai when the incident occurred. The estimated loss of the sailboat and its cargo of fish is 3,000 yuan. It is unknown whether the bow of the warship was damaged. After the incident, the USS Barker turned around and</p>
<p>Returned to Shanghai</p>
<p>Now it is docked at the naval pontoon. It will leave Shanghai after the committee completes its investigation. The USS Barker belongs to the Third Destroyer Division of the United States Asiatic Fleet and was sailing to North China with the USS Alden, USS Whipple, and USS Edsall to join the fleet for summer exercises.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Issues Tokens</h3>
<p>Industries Individually Seek Remedies</p>
<p>After the shortage panic of copper coins in the Shanghai market, caused by unscrupulous merchants hoarding them for profit, industries sought remedies by using stamps and revenue stamps as replacements. The Shanghai Tram Company and the French Concession Tram Company both issued fractional tokens. Now, the Chinese Public Bus Company of the International Settlement, in addition to reissuing the previously minted and withdrawn fractional coins, is now using the previously minted zinc passenger counters as two-fen coins. The coins are round, with a model of a public bus and the English words "China General Omnibus Co. Ltd." on the front, and the signature "GDS" on the back.</p>
<h3>Charcoal Market: Abundant Reserves</h3>
<p>Sufficient to Supply the City for Half a Year; Supply Exceeds Demand, Prices Do Not Rise</p>
<p>The city's demand for charcoal fuel has traditionally been met by the Charcoal Guild sending members to Wenzhou, Zhejiang to purchase it. However, due to the interruption of shipping between Shanghai and Wenzhou, the source decreased. Fortunately, the reserves were sufficient. However, due to hoarding by speculators, market prices fluctuated. Later, the Guild convened a meeting to unify the selling price, which allowed them to weather the crisis. According to news from the charcoal industry, since the Shanghai-Wenzhou shipping route reopened, a large amount of Wenzhou charcoal and Huangyan firewood has been shipped to Shanghai for adjustment. The current charcoal reserves in Shanghai are extremely abundant. In the market transactions, due to the ample supply of spot goods, supply exceeds demand, and major dealers are selling off their stock. Although the cost of shipping is relatively high, industry insiders, considering that fuel is a daily necessity for citizens, have decided to sell at the purchase price. It is estimated that the current charcoal reserves in Shanghai are around 80,000 to 90,000 dan, sufficient to supply the city for six months. The industry is still continuing to purchase, and large quantities may be shipped to Shanghai in the coming days. Therefore, amidst the rising prices of all goods, only the price of charcoal remains the same.</p>

It is understood that the Japanese and puppet authorities are extremely unhappy with the French authorities' decision. At 6:00 PM yesterday, a large number of Japanese and puppet military police, armed, rushed to the border area, attempting to surround the new police station. French, Chinese, and Annamite police officers, witnessing the seriousness of the situation, immediately reported to the police station. Subsequently, a large number of detectives were dispatched to assist in the defense. The police station also immediately reported to the General Police Station, and armored vehicles and armed detectives rushed to the scene, creating a tense situation. However, the forces soon withdrew, and the tense situation eased. However, the French Concession authorities attached great importance to the area. Yesterday, several trucks loaded with workers, bricks, and cement rushed to the vicinity of the new police station to build strong fortifications.</p>

<h3>Restaurant and Catering Industry Decides to Implement: Summer Abolition of Cold Dishes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, in order to promote the health of citizens, issued an order last summer requiring the restaurant and catering industry not to serve cold dishes at summer banquets to prevent the spread of unsanitary conditions and cholera. Due to the good results, it will continue to be implemented this year, stipulating that it will be enforced from July 1st to September 30th. The order was issued to the Industry Guild for compliance.

<h3>The Puppet Regime's Mediation on the Lanchang Labor Strike: No Results; The Conditions Are Harsh, Requesting the Employment of Puppet Police; The Factory Has Already Made It Clear That It Refuses</h3>
<p>Regarding the labor strike at the Lanchang Factory in Pudong, Zhu Yuzhen, a "representative" of the puppet regime, led a group of activists into the factory for the fourth time yesterday to meet with the Westerners, pretending to mediate. It is reported that the "conditions" they put forward were very harsh. The first requirement was that the Russian guards of the factory be withdrawn and that "petition police" be hired from the puppet "police station." This was tantamount to attempting to place the entire British-owned Lanchang Factory under the protection of the puppet organization. This point involves international relations and has been explicitly rejected by the factory. Therefore, discussions on other points all ended without results.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Notifies All Provinces: Implementing Financial Policies</h3>
<p>Internally Seeking Enrichment and Activity, Externally Resisting Aggression</p>
<p>In order to adapt to the needs of the environment, the Ministry of Finance has determined its financial policies to internally seek enrichment and activity, and externally resist the aggression of the Japanese. It has now notified all provinces to implement them uniformly: (1) Complete the financial network in the Southwest and Northwest, and urge local financial institutions in each province to establish branches to facilitate financial circulation; (2) Encourage savings, urge the opening of national construction savings accounts, absorb idle funds, and invest in productive industries; (3) Improve the methods of overseas remittances, urge the establishment of overseas remittance financial networks to facilitate overseas Chinese and enrich foreign exchange; (4) Allow local financial institutions in the war zone provinces to issue one-yuan notes and subsidiary currency notes to control the issuance of legal tender and prevent the Japanese from exchanging it; (5) Use local financial institutions and foreign merchants to purchase supplies in the war zone to prevent the materials in the war zone from being used by the Japanese, and to increase foreign exchange income and food for the military and civilians in the rear; (6) Strengthen the collection of gold and silver and work hard to develop gold mines to increase reserves; (7) Establish institutions to promote and connect economic and financial matters in the war zone, and plan for economic and financial matters in the area; (8) Use diplomacy to stop the circulation of Japanese and puppet banknotes and the seizure of foreign exchange. It is hoped that the provincial governments will implement these policies in earnest in order to achieve satisfactory results. Through efforts in all aspects, we must ensure that the Japanese schemes are not successful and do our best to promote and awaken the masses to fight together. Anyone who hinders the implementation of the government's financial policies should be actively prevented, saving materials and financial resources, and contribute their strength to the country for the sake of the war of resistance and national construction.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Orders All Transportation and Sales Offices: Must Not Stop Receiving Goods</h3>
<p>In order to Avoid the Accumulation of Local Products and Affect Financial Conditions; Even if There are Difficulties, Efforts Should be Made to Maintain Operations</p>
<p>The Eighth District Administrative Inspectorate of Zhejiang Province was ordered to instruct all transportation and sales offices to investigate the fact that since the Japanese aircraft have wreaked havoc, some transportation and sales offices have been using the excuse of poor economic conditions and transportation difficulties to stop receiving goods, resulting in the accumulation of local products and financial stagnation, which has had a profound impact on society. It is important to know that in the second phase of the War of Resistance, the rear is more important than the front, and production is more important than combat. All the transportation and sales offices bear the special responsibility of transporting and selling production. Even if the situation is difficult, efforts should be made to maintain operations. Why should they stop receiving goods arbitrarily due to temporary setbacks, which would harm the cause of resistance and construction? It has been ordered to the Wenzhou paper, egg, plank, and charcoal transportation and sales offices to comply. In the future, no matter what the situation, they shall not stop receiving goods without approval, and they shall list the business hours and the price of receiving goods for inspection and approval.</p>

<h3>Bank of Communications Continues to Hold Employee Training Classes</h3>
<p>The branch employees of the Bank of Communications in the interior were ordered to gather in Shanghai. The Shanghai branch was suddenly overcrowded. For the evacuated employees, it was impossible to assign positions, and it was inevitable to feel idle. Chairman Qian Xinzhi and General Manager Tang Shoumin of the head office, considering that all the employees were excellent young people and it was a pity to be idle, immediately ordered the Shanghai branch to start employee training classes for three months per semester. Those who were originally accountants were ordered to study Chinese, those who were originally clerks were ordered to study English, and other subjects such as banking and commercial regulations were also included to adjust academic knowledge and cultivate all-round talents. The head office also ordered Huang Bitong, the manager of the Hangzhou branch, and Manager Wu of the Qingdao branch to be responsible for preparations, with Wang Weisi, the secretary of the branch, in charge of academic affairs. Pan Yangyao was hired to teach Chinese, assisted by Huang Chengbo. Classes began on April 3rd and will end at the end of this month, marking the end of the first semester.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce Resigns: Committee Members Maintain the Status Quo</h3>
<p>During extraordinary times, industrial and commercial groups should maintain the status quo, which has been clearly promulgated by the National Government. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, based on a report from the Guangdong Provincial Government to the Wuchuan County Government, stated that the business of Chen Defang, the chairman of the county chamber of commerce under its jurisdiction, had gone bankrupt, and the chamber's affairs had therefore fallen into disrepair. The County Government requested to hold a re-election to reorganize it. The Ministry replied that since Guangdong Province was maintaining the status quo for industrial and commercial groups, the chamber of commerce should not hold a re-election. As for Chairman Chen Defang's resignation due to bankruptcy, the existing committee members could jointly maintain the status quo.</p>

<h3>The Case of the Robbery of the Owner of a Paint Shop: The Rickshaw Puller Denies Instigating the Crime</h3>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for Tomorrow</p>

Judge Liao Yuan opened the court for a continued hearing yesterday. The lawyer for the French Concession Administrative Authority prosecuted the case for the crime of robbery and instigation. Ms. Wang Gong, the victim, testified about the details of the robbery. Interrogated Lu, he confessed that He Jingkui called us to rob and said that the victim's family was timid and that as long as they were scared, they would hand over their property.

<h3>Xu Jufen, a Dancer at the Great Eastern Dance Hall, Unable to Endure Forced Prostitution, Sues Her Foster Father to Terminate the Adoption: The Plaintiff Did Not Appear in Court for Fear of Being Harmed</h3>
<p>Sun Hongwu, a native of Suzhou residing at 19 Xiafei Lane on Avenue Joffre, is currently 45 years old. On August 3, 1931, he adopted Xu Jufen, a woman from Haiyan, through an introduction. She was only 12 years old at the time. The woman is currently working as a dancer at the Great Eastern Dance Hall. With a lawyer's representation, she has filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court against her foster father, Sun Hongwu, to</p>
<p>Terminate the Adoption</p>
<p>And recover all of her clothing and accessories. Her reason is that the plaintiff, Xu Jufen, is now 21 years old and has reached the legal age of adulthood and autonomy. She is unable to endure the defendant's forced prostitution and was forced to leave home. She is suing for a judgment to terminate the adoption and recover her clothing and accessories. According to the report, Judge Wu Xiaoke opened the Civil Division 7 yesterday afternoon to hear the case. Both parties were represented by lawyers. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated</p>
<p>The Reasons for the Lawsuit</p>
<p>And the object of the requested judgment. The defendant's representative, lawyer Zhu Weicheng, stated that he requested the rejection of the plaintiff's lawsuit and that the costs of the lawsuit should be borne by the plaintiff. He also stated that the case could originally have been settled amicably, but because the plaintiff's whereabouts were unknown, it was impossible to conduct a settlement. It would be best if the court could persuade the plaintiff's representative that settlement was the best option and that the plaintiff should be summoned to court so that father and daughter could meet and it would be easier to reach a settlement. The plaintiff's representative lawyer also stated that the two sides</p>
<p>Although They Had Previously Considered Settlement</p>
<p>It did not materialize because they were too far apart. Now the plaintiff has heard rumors that the defendant's side wants to have thugs throw acid on her, so she dares not come to court. If the court can protect the plaintiff from any accidents, then the plaintiff would be happy to come to court to be questioned. The court verified the statements and ordered a rescheduling of the hearing to 8:00 AM on July 8th, ordering both parties to settle amicably outside of court.</p>
<h3>Russian Guard's Transportation of Opium Case: Both Culprits Vehemently Deny</h3>
<p>Luo Xinggaoyiwang (transliteration), the Russian head of the guards at the Swire Company's wharf, was arrested at 7:00 AM on the 10th of this month when he was found transporting a suitcase of opium weighing 36 pounds by rickshaw at the intersection of Rue Foch and Rue de la Cathédrale. He confessed that Zhang Dongyuan, the head of the coppersmiths on the Shuntian Wheel, had entrusted him to transport the suitcase and promised to pay him 200 yuan. Detective Wang Dongwan and detective Lu Zaiyuan then arrested Zhang Dongyuan and escorted him to the Second Special District Court for interrogation. Judge Liao, the head of the Criminal Division, opened the court for a continued hearing yesterday. Fei Xizhen, the lawyer for the French Concession Administrative Authority, explained the case and prosecuted it for the crime of selling and transporting opium. Questioned, the Russian confessed that Zhang had handed him the suitcase and Zhang had guided him in the front of the rickshaw. When he saw that he was arrested, he fled. Questioned Zhang, he confessed that the suitcase was entrusted to him by the purser in Tianjin and was handed over to the Russian to be taken away in Shanghai. He did not know that it contained opium. The court verified the confessions and announced the conclusion of the hearing, scheduling the sentencing. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Huang Bao Che Merchant Yin Zhiling Sues for Land Lease, Files Suit Against Ye Huating for Fulfillment of Lease, Ye Files Counterclaim and Seeks Termination of Lease</h3>
<p>Yin Zhiling, who operates Huang Bao Che (rickshaws), was previously sued criminally by rickshaw pullers in the First Special District Court for forging loan receipts. After a lengthy period, the case was concluded. Last winter, Yin, under the name of Anbu Enterprise Company's Yin Chulan, leased one mu and two fen of land from local resident Ye Huating, located at Yichang Road and Seymour Road in western Shanghai. An advance payment of 500 yuan was made. Later, because Yin</p>
<p>Did Not Follow Initial Agreement</p>
<p>the landlord prevented him from using the land, leading to a dispute between the two parties. After the First Special District Court acquitted Ye Huating, Yin filed another lawsuit in the civil court against Ye, seeking fulfillment of the lease. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Mo Runhua presided over the hearing. Ye also hired lawyer Pan Zhensheng to file a counterclaim against Yin, stating that Yin, through Lu Liugen and Wang Chuanmao as intermediaries in November of last year,</p>
<p>Negotiated a Lease with Ye</p>
<p>for the land. Ye initially refused, citing difficulties with the filling of the creek. Subsequently, Yin and his wife arrived at Ye's house by car, claiming they had leased land in the surrounding area and that the creek could be filled. They presented a document for Ye to sign and paid a deposit of 500 yuan, with the agreement that a formal lease would be signed within a month. If the surrounding land could not be leased, the lease with Ye would be terminated. Yin did not lease the neighboring land for a long time, so Ye sent a letter to Yin in March of this year</p>
<p>Declaring Abandonment</p>
<p>of the previously signed document, with the deposit serving as compensation for land rent losses. Unexpectedly, Yin then surrounded the land with a fence, and when Ye tried to stop him, Yin accused Ye of damaging property. After a court investigation acquitted Ye, Yin not only filed another civil lawsuit but also forcibly hired workers to build houses. Ye intervened, and construction was recently halted. Therefore, Ye is filing a counterclaim, arguing that Yin deceived him due to his illiteracy and acted tyrannically. He points out that since Yin did not sign a formal lease, he cannot claim</p>
<p>Rights to the Land</p>
<p>and requests that the deposit receipt be revoked, the deposit not be returned, and the lease relationship be terminated. Lawyer Pan also requested in court that the original intermediaries, Lu Liugen and Wang Chuanmao, be summoned to court to testify about the negotiations. After questioning both parties, the court ordered a postponement for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Large Wine Jars Piled in Alleyway, Smashed by Health Department</h3>
<p>Disregarding Public Health</p>
<p>Inside Meilan Alley, at the intersection of Avenue Balle and Avenue Lafayette in the French Concession, many large empty wine jars were piled up. The neighboring Public Health Department of the Municipal Council found that the wine jars were moldy and infested with insects, posing a health hazard. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the empty wine jars belonged to a Mr. Cao at No. 30 of the alley. Cao originally had a Xindefeng Wine Shop in Hongkou and relocated it to No. 110 Annakin Road after the war. The Health Department sent personnel to notify Mr. Cao to remove them, but Cao ignored the request. Therefore, the Health Department specifically sent workers at around 3 PM on the afternoon of the 20th to smash the empty jars one by one with hammers, totaling eighteen jars. The noise startled the neighborhood, who regarded it as a spectacle.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Rapes Girl</h3>
<p>Sun Baoshan, a Qingjiang native apprenticing at a wooden crate workshop at No. 14 Kaifeng Road, aged nineteen, lured his eight-year-old neighbor, Ji Lindi, to the loft where he slept in the workshop at 4:10 PM on the 15th and raped her. The girl cried out in pain, and her mother, Ji Dengshi, hearing the screams, immediately apprehended the apprentice Sun and turned him over to the Huishi police station. He was handed over to the First Special District Court yesterday. Due to the nature of the case concerning morality, the hearing was closed to the public. The result was detention and a scheduled pronouncement of the verdict.</p>
<h3>YWCA Holds Summer Health Campaign</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) established the Huxi Service Center, dedicated to serving poor women and children in the vicinity.

<h3>Pudong Gonghexiang Warehouse, Phosphorus Explosion, Part of Cotton Burned</h3>
<p>At the wharf of the British Gonghexiang Warehouse at Qichangzhan Ferry in Pudong, there are two warehouses, east and west. At around 5 PM on the 17th, a fire broke out in warehouse B in the east warehouse, burning more than 600 bales of foreign cotton, with a loss of 150,000 gold. While the source of the fire was still under investigation, an unexpected fire broke out four days later. At 11:20 AM yesterday morning, thick smoke and flames erupted from a pile of foreign cotton bales in warehouse C, adjacent to warehouse B. At that time, there were still ten minutes before the workers' lunch break, and the warehouse door was fortunately not closed, so it was discovered early. The Chinese fire brigade used fire extinguishers and water to put out the fire, completely extinguishing it in half an hour. It is estimated that one bale was destroyed and more than ten bales were charred, with each bale valued at 250 yuan, so the loss was relatively small. It is said that the fire was caused by a phosphorus explosion. It is unknown how this phosphorus material came to be in the warehouse, so the truth is difficult to determine.</p>

<p>Huang Hemei, an 18-year-old girl from Shaoxing who works as a weaver at the Dongyi Cloth Factory in the former Hujiazhai in Xujiahui, was enticed by Xu Shanpei, a 31-year-old Jingjiang native who worked as a clerk at the Weixin Department Store at No. 1 Caishi Road, at the entrance of the Great World on the 28th of last month. He lured her to an inn and raped her. The next day, when she returned to the factory, she suffered a vaginal hemorrhage and collapsed on the ground, losing consciousness. Fortunately, she was sent to the hospital for treatment and recovered. After learning the truth, her mother reported the incident to the police, who arrested Xu and handed him over to the Second Special District Court for investigation. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. The case has now concluded after trial, and the main text of the judgment announced yesterday stated: Xu Shanpei is sentenced to four months of imprisonment for raping a woman under the age of twenty and causing bodily harm.</p>

<h3>Symbols of the Dragon Boat Festival</h3>
<p>— EL</p>
<p>The cherry rice wine has just been eaten, and the Dragon Boat Festival is here again. Tearing off a calendar page every day is really just a lift of the hand.</p>
<p>From cotton to interlining to single layer, clothes are getting thinner and thinner, and the body feels lighter; but of the three festivals in a year, the Dragon Boat Festival is the first to settle accounts. Although everyone can follow the method of "looking at the Dragon Boat Festival, calculating at the Mid-Autumn Festival, and returning half on New Year's Eve", seeing loquats and zongzi will still bring some feelings in the spirit; thus, the body will invisibly become heavier.</p>
<p>"How to spend the festival"? ... The festival is coming, but where is the money?" ... Such things can express the "law of life response" of ordinary people to the festival.</p>
<p>Using eating symbols to represent this dragon boat festival, then the triangle can very well symbolize the plane of zongzi. Although the current zongzi, whether Su style, Cantonese style, or even Western style - the lotus seed paste zongzi of a famous restaurant is translated into English as "sweet stuffed pudding" - are "varied", using a triangle to represent it does not have a profound meaning, and everyone can understand it at a glance.</p>
<p>Here, I came up with three symbols, representing the three great festivals of the year: zongzi, moon cakes, and New Year's cake. Aren't they ready-made triangles, circles, and squares?</p>
<p>Simplicity and honesty are the best disciplines of life. These three symbols can be said to be extremely simple, and their symbols are also the most honest. For example, if you teach these symbols to children, you can guarantee that they will definitely understand them. Unless the future zongzi all become thin slices, the moon cakes are replaced with squares, and the New Year's cake is made into pills, then these simplest deformed lines will lose their meaning.</p>
<p>In the classroom for geometry, these three symbols are also the basic representatives, and all kinds of changes are produced from this. From very simple, it can be transformed into very complex.</p>
<p>Life is originally like taking an arithmetic class. The older you get, the heavier the burden, and the more complicated the arithmetic problems become. There are probably very few people in the world who can escape this arithmetic class. Most people flip back and forth during the year, sometimes triangular, sometimes round, sometimes square, always jumping out of the symbols of this simple mystery of life.</p>
<p>That said, spending the festival is ultimately a meaningful thing. If the 365 days of the year pass without a festival, wouldn't life be too monotonous and without rhythm?</p>
<p>A triangle, small like an arrow, large like a mountain, the former contains the intention of forward, sharp, and piercing; the latter implies the spirit of calm, majestic, and extraordinary; in short, small is good, and big is even better, the Dragon Boat Festival this symbol is vividly full of optimistic emotions, and the meaning of progress.</p>
<p>We hope that in this year, starting with a triangle that is full of vigor and symbolizes construction, we will move forward with a sharp arrowhead, overcoming all difficulties; then pass through the chaotic circle to reach that perfect square ending.</p>
<h3>How to Obtain Fresh Air</h3>
<p>— Lu Wenli</p>
<p>In the city, factories are lined up and the population is dense, so the air cannot be as fresh as in the countryside outside the city. So, of course, it is best to live outdoors.</p>
<p>But most of the things in the world have to be done indoors. What's more, on this crowded island, it is not easy to find a place to live indoors, let alone seek land to seek an ideal outdoor life? Therefore, the current problem of indoor air circulation must be paid serious attention to.</p>
<p>The air that people exhale is always lighter and warmer than the air they inhale. In winter, we can all see the warm air exhaled from our mouths rising slowly, which is sufficient proof. Therefore, windows should be set high in the room so that the exhaled air can flow freely from the high place. Conversely, if we need fresh air to flow into the room, then windows must be set low in the room. This does not mean that strong ventilation is hygienic, but that there must be proper fresh air in the living room to protect our health.</p>
<p>Some people think that the air at night is harmful to the human body, but this is not the case. The air at night is no different from the air during the day and is not harmful. So, opening the windows when you sleep, or sleeping outdoors in suitable weather, not only does not hinder your health, but also allows you to get smooth fresh air, which is good for your body.</p>
<h3>Safety First</h3>
<p>— Yang Lizhai</p>
<p>"The road is like a tiger's mouth, you can't walk in the middle." If you are not careful when walking, you will be injured by a toothless tiger—a car, or even lose your life under the wheels. Especially in the most prosperous Shanghai, the streets are "crowded with vehicles", and you should be extra careful to obey the order and pay attention to your own safety when walking.</p>
<p>On the road, if there is a "pedestrian road" (the water gate walk beside the road), you must walk on the pedestrian road, don't walk in the middle of the road. And to "walk on the left," do not rush forward, this can be orderly and reduce the risk of collision. If there is no pedestrian road, you must walk facing the direction of the traffic - that is, on the right side of the road, you can see the vehicles coming from the opposite side.</p>
<p>The best way to cross the road is in a place with traffic lights (red and green lights at intersections to direct traffic); the red light tells you to stop, and you can pass straight through along the pedestrian line (yellow lines painted on the road) only when the green light is on. Some intersections do not have traffic lights, so you have to watch the gestures of the directing patrol police, or look to the left first, then to the right, to see if there are any vehicles coming. If there are vehicles about to drive, you must not take the risk. If a car is approaching you, you must stop immediately, not rush to run away.</p>
<p>Clever children! Concentrate your mind on walking, safety first!</p>
<h3>Beware of the Tiger's Mouth</h3>
<h3>One Week Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Onions have been extremely cheap lately; one copper coin can buy sixteen or seventeen, so it’s good to eat more of them. This item is very rich in vitamins and can stimulate the appetite and strengthen the lungs. Those with weak lungs should eat them daily, as it can be very beneficial to the body and may help avoid entering the stage of lung disease. Therefore, it is good to eat things like onions and garlic often, and don't be afraid to eat them because of the bad breath they leave behind. The most common way to cook onions is stir-fried with shredded beef, which is indeed very delicious to eat. While frying, a peculiar aroma fills the air, stimulating the appetite. In addition, onion and sweet potato stew with beef soup, whether braised in white or red sauce, is very delicious. If you don't eat beef, you can substitute it with pork, and try stir-fried shredded pork with onions, which is not inferior to shredded beef.</p>

<h3>From the Inventions of Unknown Scientist Mr. Shen Xieyu, Discussing Soybean Extract and Raw Material Hydrochloric Acid</h3>
<p>— Huang Chengbo</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Xieyu, an unknown scientist in western Shanghai, devoted his entire life to chemistry, spending a huge amount of money. Although he exhausted his inherited family property, the shortsighted people in his hometown regarded him as foolish and ridiculed him, but Mr. Shen persevered. After thirty years of experience, he finally succeeded in his experiments, creating various fruit extracts, such as banana extract, lemon extract, orange extract, apple extract, etc. I personally tasted the samples, and they were fragrant. Other products included soap, hectograph paper, and many other items.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen considered soy sauce a daily necessity. Although there were many soy sauce shops in our country, they all stuck to old methods and had not made any improvements. Moreover, the production of soy sauce relied on sun exposure and required it to mold, which was not hygienic. Therefore, he focused on improving it, determined to research and develop it, and after many years, he finally invented Soybean Extract.</p>
<p>Soybean Extract is the chemical name for soy sauce essence. The manufacturing method is simple, the cost is low, and the taste is fresh and long-lasting, unlike ordinary soy sauce that is too strong and has a bitter aftertaste. Moreover, it is refined through scientific methods, using soybean cakes made from soybean dregs and aged alkali as raw materials, so it is non-toxic and extremely hygienic, truly a good friend of the kitchen.</p>
<p>After the invention of Soybean Extract, Mr. Shen submitted samples to the Central Health Administration for testing and applied for registration with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. After approval, he cooperated with Mr. Zhang Jingfu, a Shanghai native cloth merchant, to raise one hundred shares at one hundred yuan per share, totaling ten thousand yuan, to establish Huaming Industrial Society, specializing in the manufacture of Soybean Extract for the market.</p>
<p>The twentieth century is an era of chemical industry, and the chemical industry cannot be separated from the "three acids": "hydrochloric acid," "nitric acid," and "sulfuric acid." Therefore, it can be simply called the era of the three-acid industry. The manufacture of Soybean Extract, of course, cannot escape one of the three acids, "hydrochloric acid." It is made from amaranth cakes, aged alkali, and hydrochloric acid, and then refined. Hydrochloric acid is also an essential element for the military industry. Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the suburbs have been controlled, and even overseas navigation by Europeans and Americans has been subjected to various difficulties. The import and export of ordinary goods are also under complete control, let alone hydrochloric acid related to the military industry, which naturally attracts more attention. Therefore, the purchase of hydrochloric acid is quite difficult. Mr. Shen used his natural chemical mind and decided to seek the manufacture of hydrochloric acid himself. As the ancients said, "Where there is a will, there is a way." After many years of research, he actually reached the stage of self-manufacturing hydrochloric acid. Currently, the hydrochloric acid used by all parties is foreign goods, which not only leads to the outflow of rights and interests but also is expensive and increases costs, which in turn increases the price of goods, which has a great impact on society. In recent years, there are indeed many chemical experts in our country, but it is rare for one person to invent multiple items at the same time (the items invented by Mr. Shen have been listed above, but there are still more). Moreover, Mr. Shen does not seek social interaction, so he has not yet become famous. Making friends should be done before one encounters success, so that they can share hardships and joys together. Once one becomes famous, their value will inevitably increase tenfold, and it will be difficult to ask for advice.</p>

<h3>Classmates</h3>
<p>— Geng Zhi</p>
<p>The combination of people has "same surname" due to blood relations, and "same hometown" due to geographical relations, both of which are beneficial, needless to say; in addition, there is "classmate" due to origin, which seems to have its own benefits, and I cannot but spend some effort to commend it.</p>
<p>A few years ago, we heard that "a certain department" (classmates of a certain university) controlled the education of a certain province, so the educational circles of a certain province became "a certain university alumni association." On a slightly smaller scale, the faculty and staff of a certain school were all classmates of a certain university, so the school became "a certain university alumni association." Similarly, we also heard that the judicial officials of a certain province were all classmates of a certain law and political school, so the judicial circles of a certain province became "the alumni association of a certain law school;" or they were all classmates who studied in a certain country, so they became "the alumni association of a certain country." … Once a classmate, the reputation is tenfold, and the job is guaranteed, so you can eat without end. This is the so-called benefit of being a classmate.</p>
<p>Since it is an "alumni association," "non-classmates" are of course only squeezed out and cannot get a foothold. These "non-classmates" are of course resentful and angry. But I think for them, there is no need. Who doesn't have classmates? Why not create a few "alumni associations" to play with, instead of relying on others or trying to share their benefits? As long as you are tight-knit and powerful, it has always been allowed to create a homogeneous group and exclude dissidents, so why be polite? By creating your own alumni association, you can enjoy the benefits.</p>
<p>Originally, all classmates must be very loyal and do their best to help each other. For example, Sun Bin and Pang Juan of ancient times, I also think that they lived up to the friendship of classmates: because Sun Bin didn't have Pang Juan, where would he have his kneecap "binned" (removed), leaving a legacy for centuries and becoming a great man, and Pang Juan didn't have Sun Bin, where would he be shot to death in the Maling Road, leaving a stench for thousands of years and also becoming a great man—a great man should either leave a legacy for centuries or a stench for thousands of years! According to this analogy, their descendants Su Qin and Zhang Yi, although they seemed to have different views and their relationship was not very good, one advocated vertical alliance and the other advocated horizontal alliance, complementing each other and achieving the same goal by different means, and both obtained the position of minister. These four people formed a small "Guigu University Alumni Association" among the six countries, which can truly be compared with the modern "certain university alumni association."</p>
<p>For example, Guan Ning and Hua Xin, although they ended up "severing their mats," I think they are still worthy of being classmates. Because Hua Xin's achievements and even participation in the "palace coup" were ultimately inspired by Guan Ning, and Guan Ning's noble deeds of not serving kings and princes were also nurtured by Hua Xin. This is also a case of opposite and complementary, each with its own merits.</p>
<p>Taking current affairs as an example, we often hear that a classmate of a certain school does not engage in proper business but specializes in borrowing money from other classmates, and the alumni association issues a special notice, telling everyone not to be deceived; a certain candidate from a certain school committed a dishonorable criminal case and was detained in prison, and the alumni association hurriedly published a statement in the newspaper, denying that they had this classmate… In such cases, I still think that the alumni association is very loyal and willing to help each other, because in this way, it is enough to make the vulgar honest and the cowardly ambitious. They are publicly inheriting the consistent style of the "Guigu University Alumni Association." As for adding a job to a classmate who is beneficial to oneself, that is of course an expected article and not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The virtuous policies of alumni associations in this regard are truly beautiful and countless, and it is necessary for me to make a resolution to remain silent in addition to praise. But there are things that are as beautiful as alumni associations, or perhaps even more beautiful, that I cannot but write about in connection. I always feel that my vision is not broad enough.</p>
<p>This is the so-called "same mountain gate," or simply "same mountain" or "same origin." It is a well-known beauty that "same mountains" can help each other bargain and fight, and if you want to accomplish great things, if you are the "big brother," you must have many "virtuous brothers" from the "same mountain" to help you. People like Zhao Kuangyin and Zhu Yuanzhang were able to rise to the throne because of this. Nowadays, this trend is gradually flowing into the scholar-official class, with a tendency to replace "alumni associations." Perhaps alumni associations will be eliminated!</p>
<p>However, before "alumni associations" are eliminated, I always envy "many young classmates who are not lowly, riding fat horses in light fur coats." I can't wait to insert myself into every such "alumni association"!</p>
<h3>The Procession of Fire</h3>
<p>— Shan Di</p>
<p>The smooth, green stone road, tonight it should have the most active posture again. On the narrow sidewalks, people are densely packed, arranged in rows coming and going. At a glance, they jostle like millions of angry waves rising on the sea. The sidewalk is so crowded that people are spilled into the middle of the road one by one.</p>
<p>Especially at the corners of the busiest roads and on the steps of medieval watchtowers, people are as dense as the stars in the sky; they are not moving, stretching their necks and standing still.</p>
<p>Restaurants are also filled with people of all walks of life, and the upper floors are even more crowded with not a single space left; the row of low windows facing the road bears the burden of a large number of people leaning on them, looking out, looking at this unprecedented, lively, and grand scene in this ancient mountain city.</p>
<p>A majestic sound of drums and horns, a chaotic sound of cheers, finally broke through the dark sky and was broadcast closer; people moved again in a commotion, as if fearing that their good positions would turn bad, and their bad positions would not turn good.</p>
<p>The great procession of fire, led by the symphony of military music, moved solemnly, enthusiastically, and solemnly. Like a huge fire dragon shimmering with ten thousand feet of light, winding, long, and slowly lying in motion.</p>
<p>The intense flames painted a layer of undulating bright red on the surfaces of crowds, houses, groves, memorial arches…</p>
<p>At the head, a huge portrait of the leader, revealing a triumphant smile, carried by several bright gas lamps, made the people standing and watching could not help but stand in awe. The giant image is telling us that he 'has already seen the flame of victory; he encourages us to follow his instructions and embark on the road to bright success.</p>
<p>Arranged next to the giant image are two large rectangular lanterns. The white light emitted from inside makes the words written on them: "Kunming May Fourth Movement Torch Parade" appear even more beautiful.</p>
<p>Marching in the bright red torchlight are: university students, boy scouts, primary school students, soldiers, representatives of vocational groups. … They straightened their chests, aligned their steps, shouted earth-shatteringly to stir up the emotions of the masses, and sang movingly for the victory of the motherland, sweeping away pessimism, negativity, defeat… without leaving a trace.</p>
<p>Suddenly a team of yellow-black skinned, strange-faced "Overseas Chinese Mechanics Returning to Serve the Country" came; tall figures, uniform military uniforms. They raised torches, each burning brightly.</p>
<p>They couldn't sing much, but they would use their dialects to transform their hatred, anger…? … which had been tightly suppressed for a long time from the depths of their hearts into louder and clearer warnings. At the beginning of each short sentence, they couldn't help but forcefully raise the flag, raising the light waves of the neat line of flames above their heads.</p>
<p>There is no longer any concern, and they do as they wish to do. The moving shouts and the explosive actions made the onlookers excited, astonished, delighted, and elated. They couldn't wait to join their group and follow them to fight, serve, and live forever. …</p>
<p>Finally, a group of conscription team members of Tongji University diligently solicited donations from the crowd on the sidewalk along both sides of the road, not afraid of the trouble. And this group, who had just received fresh and intense stimulation, even the old women and coolies, generously took out their only few banknotes from their bodies and handed them over to the conscription team. Along with that, many more weights were added to this vast and brilliant national flag, which was suspended in the air and covered with colorful banknotes.</p>
<p>Several team members, very excited, very happy, let out silly laughs. …</p>
<p>Returning to the square, the movements were all silent, allowing countless torches to gather together, burning fiercely. The flames licked the boundless night sky. People cheerfully shouted the final slogans. …</p>
<p>The piles of fire were still enthusiastically, and without stopping, pouring out dazzling red light. …</p>
<h3>Gritting Your Teeth "Do It!"</h3>
<p>— Li Yishan</p>
<h3>Before the Expedition</h3>
<p>— Qian Jinxi</p>
<p>She smiles,</p>
<p>My melancholy then transforms into,</p>
<p>A white dove,</p>
<p>Flying to the distant heart of the sky,</p>
<p>And disappearing.</p>
<p>Facing the silver candlestick,</p>
<p>The military uniform lightly glistens;</p>
<p>Her silver pupils,</p>
<p>Control my emotions.</p>
<p>You must set off?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>To the front?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Tomorrow?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Then do you miss your home?</p>
<p>I say "No!" (Who doesn't?)</p>
<p>Then you don't miss me either?</p>
<p>I say "No!" (Who doesn't?)</p>
<p>(The sky outside the tent is pitch black,</p>
<p>She shakes her complaining gaze.</p>
<p>However, the motherland is calling me,</p>
<p>So I forget my home and her!)</p>
<p>Under the silver candlelight,</p>
<p>Looking at my glistening military uniform,</p>
<p>My heart gently shouts,</p>
<p>"To the front—to the front,</p>
<p>Tomorrow—tomorrow morning!"</p>
<p>So her smile,</p>
<p>(And enchanting posture,)</p>
<p>Then like a flying white dove</p>
<p>Disappears to</p>
<p>The distant heart of the sky.</p>
<h3>Impressionistic Travels (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Jinming</p>
<p>We didn't understand the cleverness of this thing, we just stared at it for a while.</p>
<p>Just as the lights were lit, I picked up the titled booklet and flipped through it. It was full of poems and commemorative texts. The handwriting of poets and writers, both named and anonymous, was dripping with ink. Writing a few words on it might feel meaningful, I thought, so I picked up a pen and wrote a few lines:</p>
<p>Layer upon layer of mountains, dense clouds lingering,</p>
<p>Only see monks, not Taoists;</p>
<p>Monks are rich, the people are poor,</p>
<p>Let's take some wine and get tipsy.</p>
<p>Da Peng and Xiao Peng looked at me writing like this, feeling a little uneasy. Because inappropriate satire can lead to unhappiness between host and guest. But the fierce-looking monk was someone with a special character. After reading it, he was unhappy at first, then he said: "Open-minded, open-minded! It's always good to praise me for being rich, and there will definitely be wine to drink. Fa Jing! Go prepare quickly, never mind the people, we'll be content if we don't humiliate them! But this doesn't rhyme!"</p>
<p>"Never mind, I'm not a poet," I put down my pen.</p>
<p>He asked Da Peng to write, and Da Peng wrote:</p>
<p>Seeing clouds is like seeing Buddha.</p>
<p>He then asked Xiao Peng, who was even more concise:</p>
<p>Appreciating the wind.</p>
<p>"Good, appreciating the wind!" the fierce-looking monk shouted, "It seems ordinary, but once you get to Shangfeng Temple, you'll know the immortality of these two words."</p>
<p>At ten o'clock in the evening, the moon crept in through the window. Da Peng and Xiao Peng were both snoring, only seeing the tired muscles on their faces twitching loosely. But I was thinking wildly, thinking about how such a good environment was inhabited by a group of stupid, lazy goods who lived by stealing in the name of the Buddha.</p>
<p>I thought, "If these people were still a group of writers, I don't know what kind of works they would write in the future. Maybe they would leave the true meaning of life, maybe they would escape the times, maybe they would make art so light and meaningless. But if we were this group of people, we would use our past experiences and imaginary landscapes. We might become Virgil, Boccaccio, Goethe, Flaubert…, we have to use will to do literature. Tao Yuanming, Li Bai, Lu You… these are all superior poets, but they are not what we should imitate. All Chinese national writers should not be imitated. They all have the defeated idea of escape. This so-called escape is not being able to 'ascend to officialdom,' and the view of failure is also because they cannot get '俸祿 (salary)'. These do not become the character of a writer; we should curse this mentality."</p>
<h3>Talking More</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zhu Wen, one of the translators of "Patriot," there are as many as seven translators of this book in Shanghai alone. Whether this book should be so highly praised is another question, which has already been discussed yesterday. But I think, if someone is willing to compare these seven translations from the perspective of translation and write an article for everyone to see, it would also be a beneficial thing. I hope someone will do this work.</p>

<h3>The Vicissitudes of Open-Air Cinemas</h3>
<p>— Dehui</p>
<p>Xiyuan and Xinyuan in the city were the earliest. There were six or seven open-air cinemas before the war. I wonder if they can reappear this summer.</p>
<p>In the summer season, many seasonal places of entertainment will appear in Shanghai, and open-air cinemas are one of them. The general audience feels that sitting in an air-conditioned cinema in extremely high temperatures is not as comfortable as sitting in an open-air cinema on a grassy field with cool breezes under a sky full of stars. To adapt to this objective requirement, many open-air cinemas have been set up.</p>
<p>The first open-air cinemas in Shanghai were the movie screenings in the Xiyuan and Xinyuan gardens in the city area during the second year of Xuantong in the late Qing Dynasty. However, due to the prevailing atmosphere at the time. As a result, it was banned by the Autonomous Public Institute. After more than ten years, in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, open-air cinemas rose again, namely the Xiaoxia Cinema on Bazhi Road and the St. George Open-Air Cinema on Jing'an Temple Road. In terms of equipment, the latter was more complete than the former. The venue was in a garden with green grass, and the rows of seats were also equipped with beer and soda, allowing people to drink as they wished. The films screened were also of a higher selection, so many people who wanted to have fun flocked to it.</p>
<p>In the summer of the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, the Dahua Hotel (now demolished) on Jing'an Temple Road opened the Dahua Open-Air Cinema. Because of its central location, convenient transportation, complete equipment, and the selection of first-class films, it was often full of guests at night, holding the top spot of open-air cinemas. This continued until Dahua was sold.</p>
<p>Later risers included the Racecourse Cinema and the Verdun Garden Cinema on Maierxi'ai Road, and cinemas were also opened on Jiaozhou Road and Kangnaot Road. For cinemas with flat roofs, such as the New World Fuxing Grand Theater (now the Xiaoyao Ballroom) and the Baixing Grand Theater on Fusheng Road, open-air movies were also screened for a period of time. In addition, open-air movie screenings on the roofs of amusement parks were even more common. But because they were ancillary, they did not attract as much attention as independent ones. The past history of open-air cinemas also has many vicissitudes to tell. The Dahua Hotel was demolished, Fuxing became the Xiaoyao Ballroom, St. George no longer exists, and Baixing has not been engaged in this business for many years. In recent years, the larger open-air cinemas that have been opened are only two: the Racecourse and one in a garden on Maierxi'ai Road. Open-air cinemas have also been opened on the roof of the Dahua Ballroom on Aiduya Road.</p>
<p>Shanghai has not had open-air cinemas for two summers since the war. I wonder if open-air cinemas can reappear this summer?</p>
<h3>Re-mentioning Old Affairs of Yu Shuyan</h3>
<p>— Liu Zhengku</p>
<p>The famous actor Yu Shuyan had a family background and secretly studied with Lao Tan. Although he did not enter the room, he had indeed entered the hall. He has dominated the Juju Club for nearly 20 years and holds the bull's ear of the Xusheng. Both insiders and outsiders unanimously recognize him as one of the successors after Xinpei. In the society of the former capital, everyone called him "Xiao Yu." Xiao Yu's 之間 (between) reached the state of perfection, but his lonely nature, arrogance, and alienation from the group were the most unsatisfactory, which was the regret of his life. He usually did not like to talk much and acted calmly, which was actually "arrogance." It is inevitable for those who rely on talent to be arrogant, so why should I blame Xiao Yu alone? Looking back more than ten years ago, when Yun Hongqing presided over the Dangui, Xiao Yu came to Shanghai, touting the orthodox Tan School. Unexpectedly, the music was too high and few people responded, and the Shanghai people did not pay attention to it. He was greatly disappointed by the demonstration of power. As a result, Dangui was busy for nothing, without loss or surplus. When the performance period expired, Hongqing told him to help for a week, if not, then three days, if not, then two days or even one day. In the meantime, more than a dozen celebrities, including Guan Jiongzhi, interceded on his behalf, but Xiao Yu refused firmly. Yun was very angry, and his disciples were even more indignant, saying: Friendship should be reciprocated, who is Xiao Yu, who is not willing to give face, to such an extent; let's wait until the day he boards the wheel, and see how we give him a special farewell. The implied meaning was to do something unfavorable to Xiao Yu and insult him. Fortunately, Brother Ji Yunqing got the news and immediately rushed to Yipinxiang to meet Xiao Yu (Mr. and Mrs. Xiao Yu originally stayed at the Datong Hotel. Both Xian Liang Meng were addicted to smoking opium. After returning from the song, late at night, lying on a couch, they accidentally left a cigarette butt, which burned the mosquito net and almost caused a fire. Datong ordered them to leave and asked them to move, so they moved to Yipinxiang). He asked him to extend the performance for one day, which was related to everyone's face. I said that if we break up unhappy, even if you never come south again in your life, why leave such a bad impression? Xiao Yu, due to Yunqing's friendship, could not refuse again and only agreed to sing for one day, posting the whole book "Pearl Curtain Village". That night, before leaving, it was a full house, and everyone was happy. The turbulent situation was dispelled by Yunqing's words. Finally, Yunqing also said that after leaving the Dangui, he and Xu Shaoqing of Tianchan went north in the same car. Shaoqing came specifically to invite Xiao Yu. When they arrived in Ping, they went to his dilapidated mansion together. Xiao Yu happily greeted them and talked about their farewell feelings, but he put Xu aside, as if he did not know him. Yunqing was afraid that Shaoqing would be embarrassed, so he introduced them. Xiao Yu said coldly, "We are already acquaintances." It can be seen that his arrogance was always like this. Soon, Xiao Yu took out his family collection of snuff to give to Yunqing, but the southerners did not like this, so he declined again before accepting it, which is still kept in the box as a souvenir.</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang's "Cosmic Peak" (Playing Zhao Gao's Daughter)</h3>
<h3>Golden Observation After "Battle of Wancheng"</h3>
<p>— Master of Aiping Studio</p>
<p>On the night of the third day of the month, a performance of "Battle of Wancheng" was staged, also known as "Horse Trampling on Young Crops" or "Cutting Hair in Lieu of Head," also known as "Zhang Xiu Assassinating His Aunt 1." Among the female roles portraying Zou Shi in this play, Tian Tongqiu (Guifeng) was previously considered the best. Tongqiu's appearance was beautiful, and her acting style and expression were delicate. Her performance in the scene of "Observing Rats and Yearning for Spring" was considered divine and truly worth savoring. Now, however, Little Cuihua is considered the best. Among the male actors playing Zhang Xiu in this play, Yang Xiaolou has always been considered the best. When Old Tan was alive, he also used this play's name, and the one paired with Zou Shi was Tian Guifeng.</p>
<p>On this day, Zou Shi was played by Mao Shilai, with light makeup and heavy powder, looking exactly like a flirtatious widow. In the scene of yearning for spring, her plain clothes were like snow, resembling a pear blossom weeping in the rain. Her searching left and right upon hearing the rat's squeak was quite delicate, truly not allowing Little Cuihua to monopolize the beauty. In the scene of meeting Cao Cao (played by Qiu Shengrong) at Baijing Tower, her eyes conveyed affection. When captured and seeing Cao Cao, she was both surprised and shy, both fearing and loving, fully expressing Zou Shi's inner thoughts of that day. Other aspects, such as her urgency upon hearing the alarming news and her anger at being abandoned, were all conveyed with precision. The scene of being assassinated, crawling on her knees to receive the spear, turning around, and the "Black Dragon Winding Around the Pillar," covering the entire stage, was particularly beautiful and worth watching.</p>
<p>Gao Shenglin's Zhang Xiu put in extraordinary effort on this day. His dialogue and expression when recognizing Cao as his father were neither too much nor too little, just right, completely different from his imposing self when fighting the young general. In each scene, he expressed Zhang Xiu's anger, forbearance, resentment, and various other emotions to the fullest extent. Furthermore, Qiu Shengrong's portrayal of Cao Cao was especially a hundred times more brilliant. The supporting roles, such as Guan Shengxi's Jia Xu, Ai Shiju's Hu Che, and Zhang Lianting's Xu Chu, were all extremely well-suited, making it a truly excellent play.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Decline of Woyun Residence and the Progress of Li Duokui</p>
<p>From then on, he was able to obtain the true essence of the Gong family's expertise even more. Old Gong suffered from many illnesses and was also advanced in age. He hardly attended to matters such as joining troupes and private performances. Sometimes, he would decline engagements and recommend Woyun to take his place. He even transferred his own instrumentalist (Lu Wu) and drummer to Woyun. From this, it can be seen that Old Gong's love and care for his highly talented disciple had reached an extreme. Therefore, around 1920, Woyun Jushi was truly at the height of his popularity, famous throughout Tianjin and Hebei. All those experienced in appreciating opera praised him as the second Gong Chu (Gong Chu, Sun Chu, both were Yunfu, Juxian's stage names when performing as an amateur).</p>
<p>Generally speaking, those who work in the arts should not be too complacent or arrogant. Seeing that Old Gong was increasingly aging and that there was no successor in the old female role category, Woyun became extremely conceited, and his temperament became more and more arrogant day by day. Unexpectedly, around 1925 or 1926, an old female role actress named Li Duokui emerged, and she actually began to compete with him. Speaking of Duokui's history, it was not particularly noble. Although he was also from the world of opera, he was not from the Erhuang troupe. In the past, Guo Baozhen (also known as Old Wu Yuanhong), the leading actor in the role of bearded old man in the Qinqiang opera, had a Huqin player named Li, who was Duokui's uncle. Back then, Guo Baozhen's reputation was on par with Tan Xinpei of the Peking opera troupe, and therefore, Huqin Li's fame was comparable to that of Mei Yutian. The Huqin used in the Bangzi opera troupe is commonly referred to as the "Huqin." Duokui's uncle had extensive knowledge of the Huqin. He was good at vocal accompaniment and followed Guo for a long time. Guo was unwilling to perform on stage without Li's assistance, just like Mei and Tan. Because of the aforementioned reason, Huqin Li was also famous throughout Tianjin and Hebei. Duokui originally studied Bangzi opera, but later, seeing that Qinqiang opera was no longer popular, he switched to studying Erhuang opera with his father. He initially played the role of a bearded old man and became famous in Yantai, Harbin, and other places for performing famous plays such as "Taking Chengdu" and "Wenzhao Pass." He was short in stature but had ample breath, able to sing in the B-flat key. Because he had such a good voice, he was able to gain customer approval everywhere. (43)</p>
<p>Hardy's New Film</p>
<h3>Big Brother Elephant Performed in London</h3>
<p>— Huazhi</p>
<p>After the comedic star Laurel and Hardy finished filming "Block-Heads," they suddenly had a disagreement over billing, which eventually led to their breakup. Movie fans all over the world were very sorry because they felt that when they worked together, one fat and one thin, they were a perfect match, but when they separated, they were nothing to watch. Therefore, recently, some people have brought them back together, and Laurel and Hardy have also expressed their approval. The two are expected to re-sign a contract for cooperation. The tired Laurel even gave Hardy a warm kiss on his bald head to celebrate.</p>
<p>During the breakup period, the fat Hardy continued to shoot films, trying to enlist the actress Joan Paige as a pillar, but he didn't know how to start. So he grabbed a few elephants from the zoo to act as partners and pieced together a film called "Big Brother Elephant Never Forget." This film has recently been staged in London. During the production, because the elephant's body was clumsy and there was no gimmick, Hardy had nothing to show except to cling to the elephant's tail and scream or sleep under the elephant's belly. He had already complained bitterly, so he was very happy to work with Laurel again, and he will use the ups and downs of the breakup period as the subject matter of the new film.</p>
<h3>Actors' Activities</h3>
<p>Wang Xichun to Film Today. Since the filming of the film "Wen Su Chen" by the All-China Film Company began on June 1, Xiao Wu Wang Xichun was originally scheduled to start filming on the 20th. Later, due to the Dragon Boat Festival, she had to perform daytime shows at the Carlton Grand Theatre, so she requested a postponement. It is now scheduled to start today, filming the "Forest" scene. This beauty has been diligently reading the script for days.</p>
<p>Yang Baotong Will Rehearse Han Xin. Since Yang Baotong joined the Da Jing Ban of Sincere Amusement Park, he has been rehearsing his teacher's masterpiece, Dong Xiaowan, which has been very popular. Now Yang plans to rehearse the entire Han Xie after this play. He was a little ill the other day, with vomiting and diarrhea, but he still performed as usual. Also, the female actress Jiang Yunxia of the troupe, due to a hoarse voice, took leave on the afternoon of the day before yesterday and went to Dr. Zhu Nansheng for treatment.</p>
<p>Gai Junting Returns to Shanghai from Xiamen. The martial arts actor Gai Junting, originally with the Yanping Grand Theater on Gulangyu Island, Xiamen, has now completed his term and left. He returned to Shanghai by the Jinan wheel on the 18th. He and the female actress Qian Shumin are engaged and will be living together in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Theater News. The New Drama Society Experimental Theater originally planned to perform "Reunion" at the Carlton Theater the day before yesterday (the 18th), but due to incomplete script review procedures, the drama department of the society decided to perform "Love Letter," which had recently been performed at the Youth Association. On the morning of that day, more than nine o'clock, the upper and lower seats were already full, but temporarily due to special circumstances, it could not be performed. The general audience returned with sympathy and disappointment. The tickets sold were voluntarily not refunded. Yesterday, it was heard that the person in charge of the society said that the tickets for that day will still be valid for the performance next week, please do not discard them, and convey our apologies to the audience.</p>

<p>(Chess Talk)</p>
<h3>More on the Titling of Chess Endgames</h3>
<p>— (Weihan)</p>
<p>Regarding the naming of chess endgames, Mr. Bao Zibo has already discussed it in this newspaper the other day, but Weihan still feels that there is room for supplementation. There are three principles for naming them: (1) Suitable for the chess situation, such as "Distinguishing Between Chinese and Barbarians" and "Bees and Wasps Unleashing Venom"; (2) Suitable for the number of pieces, such as "Seven Stars Gathering" and "Erlang Subduing Demons"; (3) Suitable for extraordinary times, such as "Resist Aggression to the End," "Final Victory," "Sacrificing Without Regret," and "Losing Virtue and Securing Honor." Because there have been strange and peculiar titles recently, they are listed as follows: (1) For example, "Deceiving the World and Stealing Fame"; (2) Meaningless, such as "Seeing the Strange as Not Strange," "Cherishing One's Own Broom," and "Literature Misleading the Country"; (3) Feudal Ideology, such as "The Emperor's Personal Expedition." Weihan deeply feels this, so he specifically cites them, hoping that friends who submit articles will correct the errors and that those responsible for advocating them will pay special attention.</p>

<h3>The Case of Chargerford Shooting a Chinese Person</h3>
<p>The case of Chargerford shooting a Chinese person has been thoroughly investigated by Shanghai Magistrate Ye, together with British Judge, Mu Consul, and Yan Deputy Consul, who summoned the original witnesses for interrogation. According to his fellow porter Gu Ronghua, "On that day, Chargerford called six workers to work from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm, giving each person 250 cash per day. The deceased's hometown is three miles away from my home, and his name is Zhou Qinqin. The other four are Yan Xixi and Zhu Dasheng, and I don't know their names. That day, the workers worked until 6:00 pm and asked Chargerford for money. He only gave a total of 300 cash. When asked whether the money was to be divided among the six people or given to one person in total, he said it was to be divided among the six people. The deceased argued with him because he had personally promised to pay each worker 250 cash per day, and the amount was insufficient. Chargerford then used his fists and feet and went into the house to fetch a Western rifle. We ran away, going through a small alley to the main road. Looking back from the main road, the deceased was nowhere to be seen. Before reaching the main road, we heard a gunshot. When we returned to look, the deceased was lying on the ground, with blood and flesh flowing." Chargerford's lawyer Luo Pisheng asked who walked out first and who walked out last on that day. Gu Ronghua replied that Yan Xixi and the other four were in front, I was in the middle, and Zhou was in the back. When asked whether the rifle was fired continuously or separately, Gu Ronghua replied that there was one shot, then another. When asked what he did that day, Gu Ronghua replied that he washed seven wooden logs and carried four stones. When asked how much he had received for his work, Gu Ronghua replied that the money was in Zhou Qinqin's hands, and when he was shot and fell to the ground, the money was scattered. The coroner was then questioned, and he said, "On Thursday, I was summoned to examine the body of the Chinese person. One-third of the top of the head had been blown away, and the brain matter and blood were scattered all over the ground. A small pellet was found in the brain, entering the head one inch to the right of the right eye, and the trajectory sloped upward and penetrated to the top of the head." Thereupon, the judge sentenced: "The defendant is convicted, and the sentence was originally intended to be severe. However, considering that the defendant has shown remorse and regret, compensated the family of the deceased with 500 yuan, and that his usual behavior has been proper, the sentence is reduced and set at two years of imprisonment."</p>
