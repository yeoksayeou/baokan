<p>社評</p>
<h3>國聯行政院本屆決議之後</h3>
<p>國聯行政院本屆常會的開會提案以及決議，本報已經一再詳述。對於中國代表顧維鈞所提出的二項要求，定了二項決議：（一）向各社評　國聯行政院本屆决會員國建議，在可能範圍內，個別援助中國；（二）譴責日本飛機轟炸中國普通人民，並請各會員國與非會員國，今後倘再知此種轟炸情事，應即通吿國聯行政院。而於組織援華調整委員會的要求，却明白拒絕了。</p>
<p>日本武力侵華，發動將及八年。當初爲國聯的中堅英法兩國，不能堅決發揮國聯盟的的原則，運用國聯的機構嚴正制裁侵略者；至美國雖負有九國公的條的的神聖義務，亦因孤掌難鳴，無所作爲；於是日本更毫無顧忌，蹂躪了一切國際條的，蹂躪了中國的主權人民土地；即英法美各國家的在華利益，也飽受了侵蝕和威脅。最近又變本加厲，發動排英運動，企圖變史租界現狀；控制中國海岸之不足，企圖根絕他國的船舶，航行於中國海內。因此，我們不妨假想一個現象，即中國倘若不抗戰，則各國在華利益，還能保留嗎？中國抗戰倘若失敗，則各國在華利益還能保留嗎？日本的野心如此，行動如此，中國戰不戰的關係如此，中國勝不勝的關係又如此，而國聯的決議案却如彼；我們忍無可忍地鳴不平！</p>
<p>國聯行政院的決議案，不但內容貧，井且效力弱；不但弱，幷且招致了事實的椰掄。他不具論，遠不具論，請檢討國聯行政院本屆常會開慕以後的形形色色；一，鼓浪嶼問題原來沒有解決，但英法美海軍陸戰隊登嶼以後所呈現的些微好氣象，猶如曇花一現，瞬息幻滅；最近二日，日本又强項，局勢又嚴重了。二，英國郵船朗浦拉號，即在英國視爲極束據點的香港口外，被日本軍艦迫令停駛，登船檢查了。三，法國郵船阿拉密斯號，亦在香港附近被檢查了。四，日本國內的反英宣傳，聲勢復盛了。五，日本加入德義政治軍事同盟條的之說，盛傳於東京柏林了。六變更租界的企圖，更進了一步，變爲所謂「收回租界」了。七，直接爲答復國聯行政院決議案起見，供給國聯會員國與非會員國的報告資料起見，又大炸其重慶市區，大殺其徒手市民了。八，日本侵華的意嚮與限度，雖舉世皆知，而日本始終遮遮掩掩，吞吞吐吐；對遠東，倡所謂新秩序：對淪陷區，立所謂新政權；對在精衛，講所謂息戰議和；一直到了昨天，日本外務省發言人，在東京招待新聞記者席上，老實聲稱：日本「以國家之命運爲孤注，其在華行動之目的，爲欲置中國主權於日本統制之下；」不用說，這是把在精衛輩一脚踢出，亦是在國聯所承認中國爲被侵略國的決議案下，簽了一個侵略國的花押。</p>
<p>這幾樁事實，即使不必盡指爲與國聯態度有直接的因果關係，至少顯然地皆在國聯行政院本屆常會開慕以筏的一演出。」針對這種演出，祇有中國毫不猶豫，毫不慚愧，以繼續抗戰爲答復；這却爲難了英法領導的國聯，蘇聯代表主席的行政院常會，且看它們將如何繼其後？</p>
<h3>日圖封鎖華海岸　英美均深切注意　交換意見取一致行動　考慮應否採報復手段　英議員曾有嚴重詰問</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據每日民聲報載稱、已往數日內、日本之侵迫行爲、已引起與遠東有關各國之「重大關切」、聞英海軍當局刻正考慮計畫、對航行中國海面之英輪、供給海軍衛護隊、關於阿拉密斯號輪事件、預料法當局將提出强硬抗議、其方針與英國所提關於日水兵在鄰近香港領海登朗浦拉輪事之抗議相類、（二十六日路透社電）</p>

<h3>歐局近頃的經偉</h3>
<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>世界的命運興遠東的前途（續）</p>
<p>歐洲通信</p>
<p>還有第二椿。據最近的德國軍事當局們的意見，如果德國想再行擴張的話，那末，無論如何，牠必須要取得蘇聯的不干涉或不能干涉的先決條件。照他們的估計，如果這一點能辦到，那末，德·意·盡可立即向英·法·提出領土要求，英·法，絕對不敢應戰，縱使戰起來的話，英國也一定會半途退場，讓法國一國受德·意·的宰割。所以，當不久前，日本向德國提出進攻蘇聯問題時，德國方面，立刻予以拒絕。隨著，德國卻向日本提出另外的新意見，那大致是：（一）目前中·日·戰最後決勝點，是在於歐洲的總形勢，而不在於東亞；日本這樣戰下去，一定會歸於失敗；（二）如果日本再附和德·意·威脅英·法，使德·意·在歐洲取得決定勝利時，那末，到那時，德·意·願傾全力來幫助日本，對付蘇聯；（三）為了履行目前的任務，日本在現在中國的各個戰場，應取完全的守勢；但同時，派遣海軍艦隊到地中海以及相當的陸空軍到菲洲。這一計劃雖未實現，然而德·意·目前之無意對付蘇聯，是非常明顯的。</p>
<p>因了這些現象，所以，在目前的英國，到處充滿了對德·蘇。默契的担心。隨手舉兩個例子在這裏；第一件，是最近太晤士報上出現的一個警告，這個警告，是牠的駐羅馬記者發出來的，他提醒英國人士們呌他們一刻不要忘記希特拉在一九三〇年所說過的話，那是：他要[把印度給予蘇聯；把菲洲分給意大利。]第二件，在英國目前有一部書中的一句話，受到了許多人的談論和注意。書是一個　國人杜勒克爾博士的近著，書名曰The　End　of　Economic　Men，而那句名言呢，却是：[無論從那一個角度看，蘇德間的接近，幾乎是不可免的。除非在最近期內，有一個大規模的戰爭，或者可以阻止牠。－－所謂最近期間也者，一九四〇年，是最後的期間了。]這句名言的寫下來，是遠在英國這次改變政策以前，然而，還是很可注意的。</p>
<p>然而，這一節所述，從英·法·的立場看來，衹可以說是暗影；此外，最近也還牠的光明面。光明面是什麼呢，是：</p>
<p>（三）從英國內部分野上看英德的再接近是更加渺遠了</p>
<p>誰都知道，英國內部親德的大集團，是代表金融界，銀行資本家·貴族·封建地主利益的，所謂克利夫登集團（Cliveden　Set）。裏面，號稱健將的人物，是：現在外相的哈立法克斯，太晤士報主筆的道生（Dawson），新任駐美大使的羅惜恩（Lord　Lothian），以及觀察報的主筆加爾文（Garvin）等等。而尤其上面舉出名字的這幾位，向來是強烈親德論者。現在呢，却一律變了論調，站到反德的立塲上了。比這幾個人更可注意的，還是那位身居[克利夫登集團]東道主地位的觀察報主人的亞斯特爾（Astor）的改變態度。這位亞斯特爾，一向，是被認為德國外交在英國的義務代言人，現在呢，也公然地主張英國不能再讓步的論調了。這一切，真是一個大的改變！</p>
<p>這些日子以來，張伯倫首相，不斷地在一條兩歧的路上徘徊：蘇聯呢？還是索性對德讓步到底？而每次從[克利夫登集團]裡上述的這幾位人物都見，他都和以前不同地，受到了絕對不再對德屈服的勸告。現在，剩下來還保留原來的立塲，主張繼續親德論者的人物，比較引人注目一點的，似乎僅僅有一位現任張伯倫顧問的威爾生（Wilson）了。然而他的聲音，和全英國廣大的聯蘇的呼聲一比時，事實上，連蚊子的哼哼也似乎抵不上。</p>
<p>不過，這些，僅僅的是表示一種主要的趨勢，至於一涉及到實際各別問題時，究竟會怎麼表現，那當然又是另一個問題。比如，但澤的問題，到底怎樣呢？現在，誰也不敢預言英國到底會取什麼態度。</p>
<p>德國方面，也知道了這些近來英國親德人士們態度的變更，所以，作為挽救起見，上個禮拜，德國以[英國通]現任外長的里本特洛夫，就派遣他的親信吉爾（Baron　Geyr）來到了英國，從社交上，作種種的活動。這位吉爾一到了英國，立刻聚集了所有的在野的在朝的親德人士們，交換了許多意見，可是，所收效果呢，似乎並不大。而最大失敗，是他在李緋諾夫去職後所散布的德·蘇·談判的消息，立刻被蘇聯駐英大使邁斯基鄭重地否認了。</p>
<p>衹要一看得到邁斯基大使否認後的哈立法克斯外相高興的情形，那末，英國今天怎麼切望和蘇聯接近和德國疏遠，是一目就可以了然的了。</p>
<p>（四）德意軍事同盟的正式宣佈和日本的半途退縮　德·意·軍事同盟的存在，已經不是一天；而最近的正式宣佈，也並沒有引起什麼驚異。不過，略略引起一點驚奇的，却是日本的半途退縮。照日本的立塲看，這一著，對牠自己，是非常不利的。已經一再宣稱要造[東亞新秩序]的日本，和已經強調向日本送過[最後意見]的美·英·法的維持九國公約的政策之聞，事實上，已經是斷絕了妥協的餘地。難道已經打算自認失敗，准備放棄所謂[東亞新秩序]了嗎？</p>
<p>很明顯，是並不然的。在今天的英國，流行的解釋，似乎衹有兩個：（一）美國艦隊的開回回太平洋，（二）中國抗戰的成功。</p>
<p>據在此地得到的消息，原先，日本已答應派遣海軍到地中海來示威了；後來，看到了負　接洽責任意外長齊亞諾態度的強硬，日本忽然怕了起來；牠當然怕弄假成真了，和英·法·真開了戰。於是，牠來了一個躊躇。因此，鬧得牠駐意大使幾乎要忿而辭職。</p>
<p>不過，這也是絕構不成退出軍事同盟的理由，日本不敢和中·英·美·法·蘇·五國作戰；其實，德·意·在目前，又何嘗有真幹的勇氣？</p>
<p>當然，英國還是想把日本從侵略集團裡拆出來的；不過，英國的對蘇對中的態度，却另有牠的考慮，絕不是因為日本這一舉，而有根本的　　。</p>
<p>日本這一舉，除去寒了德·意·的心而外，其它他的影響，似乎很少；已經孤立了的地位，是更加孤立了。僅僅從個交的運用上看，這對於牠自己，實在是非常無意義，非常手忙腳亂的一著。不過，從種種象徵看起來，這退縮，也衹有暫時的可能，如果牠不自認失敗，堅持要造什麼[東亞新秩序]，那末，大勢之所趨，縱使明知德·意·是冒險，牠也不得不終於被捲了進去。（完）</p>

<p>加以其他因素之結果、本星期初、華與幣即已暴跌、須一百六十元始能購得法幣百元、日方在平津將一聯準一幣「緊釘一日元、但在滬已無力出此矣、日幣在滬崩潰之其他因素、包括日軍禁以月値日金三百萬元之大豆售往上海、</p>
<p>另一因素</p>
<p>由於月有日人八千三百五十人、自日來滬、各携法定限額日金五百兀、故流入上海之日元、月共四百萬元、年計五千萬元、又一因素、乃由於日軍對正常運輸巨額日貨入華中、加以限制、日方且已企圖强令日商在能獲得具外匯價値的貨幣之國家中出售貨物、此間日陸海軍發言人解釋日元</p>
<p>價値暴跌</p>
<p>純屬「地方」事件、頗少眞正重大關係云云、此種解釋、與事實不符、日方已圖限制旅客、甚至商人携返日本的日元之數額藉以死命塡補日元之「上海漏洞」、但無效用、此種局勢、其事實在於日本國會最近會議之末幾日內、核准延遲之膨脹、業已實行、但對公衆</p>
<p>則守秘密</p>
<p>其所以能守秘密者，因官方難持滙率、政府維持警務　制、防社零售價格之增高、然今已不復能守此秘密矣、　官方雖力加防杜、與店主為得外幣起見、願出較官價爲高之滙率、物價卒已高漲、暫使本埠日幣不跌、或屬可能、但僅係暫時之努力、蓋任何國家不准其自已貨幣携返本國者、其財政壯態、已危殆矣、</p>

<p>米價回跌　急轉直下</p>
<p>國米來源、經各米業團體竭力疏通後、來源增加、價格趨穩、民食無虞匱乏、况際此黃霉時節、囤戶紛紛出籠、以致米價回跌甚烈、昨日市塲頭號白米已跌至十七元二角、並買者存心觀望、市塲現貨充斥、供過於求、有內地帮等購進五千多包、然市面因跌勢過烈、至買賣者難定主意、至於市塲秩序、將趨正途、昨日共計成交八千餘包、</p>

<h3>日方公然宣稱　檢查一切輸船　甚至在中國領海以外　亦須調查輸船之身份</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、日方昨日（二十五日）招待新聞記者席上、討論星期三日、日兵在香港領海外登朗浦拉號與阿拉密斯號兩郵輪事件、日海軍發言人解釋稱、爲調查輪船之身份起見日海軍保留在中國海岸附近、甚至中國領海以外、登任何大小輪船檢查之權、日當局近得有情報、必須出此步驟、調查</p>
<p>輸船身份云、有詢日軍登外輪、不問該輪載何種貨客、如巳證明其身份屬實、將吾扣留之、發言人答、如輪船被用作軍事目的、以援助蔣政權者、則日當局對該輪、頗難放行云、有詢如輪上抄出違禁物、局勢將如何、發言人答、此乃困難問題、某記者詢、此與未宣戰而</p>
<p>封鎖無殊乎、發言人答、日當局不反對和牛的貿易、又詢食物與醫藥品亦在海岸封鎖之內乎、發言人稱、如物品確屬軍用者、自然將發生問題、目前確切禁止自日軍佔區運輸物品往中國其他部份、某　籍記者詢、如第三國海軍決派兵衛護定期輪船、日方將何以答覆之發言人稱、此乃</p>
<p>難以答覆</p>
<p>之問題、渠以爲美國海軍不致出此、某記者詢、阿拉密斯爲二萬二千噸之巨輪、中國並無此種大小之輪船、且該輪被迫令停駛時、不在中國領海內、發言人答如屬必要、日海軍將檢查一切輪船之身份、截至昨日爲止、日方並未接得關於登阿拉密斯號輪之抗議、發言人末乃切實吾認鼓浪嶼現局、與檢查該兩輪有什何關係、</p>
<p>法報記載二十六日法文上海日報載、關於法郵船阿拉米斯號被日方檢查事、昨晚、日方新聞報導席上、日發言人乃與記者發生質問戰、茲將雙方之問答詞、的略如决、（間）發言人能解釋對於法郵船阿拉米斯號之被檢查事件乎、（答）對於詳情，尙不及知、但擬爲查明其船籍</p>
<p>果屬何人耳、（問）該郵船繪有法國三色旗、日軍豈未之見耶、（答）華人之冒用法旗者殊多也、（問）日本檢查外國商輪、係根據何種法律、（答）根據國際法、（問）若依此法、則他國軍艦、亦可以檢查日本商輪乎、（答）此則不可、（問）豈國際法</p>
<p>獨允日本</p>
<p>有此權利耶、（答）因日本對華作戰、而宜布封鎖中國海岸耳（問）此决檢查、與鼓浪嶼事件有關乎、（答）無關係也、（問）若以軍艦護輪、日方亦將檢查之乎、日方對於此問、乃避不置答而罷、惟允俟査明實情後、再行報吿、</p>

<h3>鮮猪業糾紛事件　租界當局籌商解決　提出三項原則交該同業考慮　內地來貨有限營業仍感困難</h3>
<p>關於本市鮮猪行及鮮肉兩業、遵從租界當局勸吿、一律復業後、惟因內地來源有限、求過於供、營業前途、仍感困難、至於日僞非法截阻鮮猪所引起之糾紛、兩當局正在籌商具體解決辦法、英商怡和公司同和輪前被日海軍扣留之猪隻、經交涉後、即將釋放運滬、茲將各情分誌如决、</p>
<p>來源有限　營業困難</p>
<p>本市鮮猪行肉兩業之同業二千餘家、前因僞牲畜市塲非法刦奪內地鮮猪來源、而激成全體停宰、停秤·停業糾紛、頗爲嚴重、鮮猪肉行店堅決表示、非達到圓滿解決、誓不復業、其犧牲果敢之精神、深得各界同情、嗣後兩租界當局、深恐糾紛延長不決、容或發生與治安上攸關之事件、故剴切勸吿兩業團體、以維護民食前題、先將剩餘猪隻秤賣、一面復設法疏通來源、是以全體同業行店爲遵重當局勸吿一雜復業、惟自復業以來、近將旬日、雖來源並未阻斷、但每日運滬猪隻、僅及過去十分之二、（每日兩租界區的四五百頭、）數甚有限、宰牲公司所宰之猪、應銷市面、深感求過於供、市價因此繼漲、故鮮猪業營業前途、仍荊棘叢生、難期樂觀、</p>
<p>當局策商　解决辦法</p>
<p>全市鮮猪肉　行店、經當局動導、忍痛復業後、關於日僞非法截阻鮮猪來源、所引起之糾紛據悉公共租界工部局與法租界公董局、均在注意進行中、除提出三項原則、諭令兩業團體、詳加考慮外、一面復商策具體辦法、將向日方從事談判、俾早日解決、</p>
<p>被扣猪隻　交涉釋放</p>
<p>近來由內地運滬之鮮猪、除大部份由日輪運抵虹口轉卸「市塲」外、其少數部份、則歸德意商之外輪運入兩租界區卸貨、至英商各輪、現仍負責承運、惟同和事件發生後一般猪販商、仍有恐懼心理、故裝運甚少、所有前决怡和公司之同和輪承裝鮮猪二百餘頭、在新港被日海軍扣留後、疊經駐華英領署當局提出交涉結果、據聞該項扣猪、日內即可釋放、</p>
<h3>兩英倫　復航張江　由砲艦兩艘護送　載供應物與英兵</h3>
<p>大陸報云、日方昨（二十五日）晚招待各報記者時宣佈消息、英商輪兩艘、定下星期自滬起椗、直放漢口、該兩輪爲怡和公司之瑞和輪與太古公司之蕪湖輪、其確切起椗日期、尙未宜佈、惟昨晚據上海可靠方面傳稱、兩輪或將於星期一或二日啟程又聞英國揚子江巡邏隊之</p>
<p>砲艦兩艘</p>
<p>、或將護送前往、兩輛之一、或係蠍號、怡和與太古兩公司人員昨日吾認彼等試圖貫通日方對揚子江之封鎖、而從事外國商業、據稱、彼等擬派瑞和與蕪湖兩輪赴漢口、曾詳細通知日當局、而日方已加許可云、此說昨晚由日海軍發言人加以證實、渠答覆某</p>
<p>外籍記者</p>
<p>之詢問、承認日方已得該兩公司通知派輸航行、據渠所悉、該兩輪將載供應物與瓜代兵、供給駐守上海與漢口間沿揚子江一帶之英海軍、並不載旅客或商業貨物云、兩公司人員所言、亦與此說相符、昨晚聞諸可靠方面、兩輪抵漢卸下物品後、即將返滬、兩輪此行、雖非開放揚子江、供外國航行之先聲、但爲一九三七年秋、江陰置水柵後英輪初决自滬直駛漢口、故具有重要性、</p>

<p>滬甬航綫、自經核准恢復後、德商謀福輪業已首决試航返滬、意商康沙義·德平兩輪、亦經先後駛甬、故交通漸復常態、前晨鎭海雖再度被炸、但對通航並無影響、謀福輪原定昨日下午四時駛甬、旋因裝貨不及、決改今晨四時起椗、照常直放寗波、昨晚報轉滬甬航錢因鎭海被炸、已告臨時中止當係傳聞之誤、</p>

<h3>中國　中等師範敎育概况（二）　課程標準製定五種　會考方法略有變更</h3>
<p>經費方面</p>
<p>當此積極推行義務敎育之際、各省在最近若干年需要大量之短期小舉師資、故簡易師範應在師範敎育內佔一重要地位、然簡師以由縣設立爲原則、省以辦理師範學校爲主、其所需經費、在省中等敎育經費內、照二十二年所頒各省市中等學校設置及經費支配標準辦法之規定、以的佔百分之二十五爲度、並規定自二十三年度遂步改正、於二十六年度止、達到標準之規定、</p>
<p>至師範學校校內經費之分配、照修正師範學校規　第二十條規定、除學生膳食因各地情形不一、免膳費辦法及其額數各異、未便計入外、俸給至多不得超過百分之七十、設備費至少應佔百分之二十、辦公費至多不得超過百分之十、其稽核辦法、亦與中學同、</p>
<p>課程方面</p>
<p>民國十九年敎部頒布高中師範科課程暫行標準、紛擾多年、漫無準繩之師範學校課程問題、至是始暫得一解決、一十一年師範學校制度重行改正、二十二年九月、敎部依據師範學校規程、頒布各類師範學校及師範科敎學科目及學期每週敎學及自習時數表九種、二十三年製定體育學校敎學科目及各學期每週敎學及自習時數表一種、同年九月、將高中師範科課程暫行標準、修訂爲師範學校課程標準、二十四年、陸續頒布鄉村師範學校、簡易師範學校、簡易鄉村師範學校、三年制幼稚師範科、二年制幼稚師範科課程標準五種、其特別師範科、簡易師範科、及體育師範學校之課程標準、則尙未訂定、各該標準之體例、與中學課程標準同、惟敎學科目及時數、均較中學爲多、</p>
<p>設備方面</p>
<p>師範學校之理科敎學分量、較之中學爲少、故中學理科設備標準、用之於師範學校、有餘無不足、因之尙未特別訂定師範學校設備標準、擬俟於修訂師範學校課程標準時、再予增補、至此項設備標準之補充、亦擬俟繼續補充中學設備時、連帶解決之、</p>
<h3>本市各校將優待　戰士子弟</h3>

<h3>交大敎授陳容普演講　投考交大應注意事項　本屆考期定七月二十八日</h3>
<p>交通大學敎授陳容普昨應私立常州中學之請、演講交大內容及新生投考應注意事項、演詞由張格茹君紀錄、茲將投考事項一節錄下、以貢本屆投考交大學生之參考、（編者）（上略）本校（即交大）木年度暑假招生仍在七月中、報名自七月二十二日至二十五日、考期自七月二十八日至三十一日、考試科目則理工兩院相同、而管理學院則不同、</p>
<p>甲、理工學院　國英·史或地（又有史地俱考之說）理化·數學（按共考六科、惟數學佔二百分、共七百分、）</p>
<p>乙、管理學院　國·英·史地·數理或化、經濟大意·簿記</p>
<p>交大每科試騐時間爲三小時、此爲本校習慣、試題除國英外其他各科、均得任以中文或英文作答案、至於試卷考分之統計、則稍特殊、若有一科成績不滿二十分者（數學例外、須四十分）然後方平均統計、依成績之高下而酌銓名額、開會時冉由校長及委員評判後取定、體格不良及口試不及格者、皆在不取之列、應考者宜切實注意之、口試時、主試者問話不定、有關於時事、私人生活家庭、學校情况等等問題、然投考電機系者、口試時槪爲學術問題、（如理化常識等）其他各院系不定、惟應答時須鎭定、口齒須伶俐、</p>
<p>交大自上年度起爲內地各國立大學代招新生、試題與本校相同、考生先由木校選定後再呈敎部檢查核定公布、本年度亦將舉行、</p>
<p>一般皆認爲本校試題繁難、此爲不可吾認之事實、然此點亦爲本校特殊之處、蓋非如此不能選拔眞才也、故必須天才及學業並高者方有錄取希望、此原爲國家爲眞才着想、况多年來之經騐、益證此法之有效、雖經敎部之指令及學界之要求亦不忍捨此良法也、然則試題、繁固繁矣、難固難矣、亦不超越範圍、能深切了解及應用各種學科者、常能勝任也、如數學試題、採取普通之命題殊無意義、而亦無從測騐眞才、非以特殊之題、不能啟發有天才及眞了解之學生、試由本校歷届試題觀之、可概知一切、且出題者亦力望能以寥寥數題包羅萬象、囊括書本中之精華、以供眞才者之目我試測也、（未完）</p>

<p>上海特輯</p>
<h3>國貨工商業向何處走</h3>
<p>— 馬其</p>
<p>年來國貨製造業勃興，各種工廠大都　集上海一帶，自八一三抗戰發生，各大工廠或被彈燬，或被強佔，　受重大打擊，舊恨新怨，言之扼腕；有志之士或收拾燼餘，遷廠租界，或赴香港，或赴川黔滇桂，重設新廠，今都蓬勃又茁新芽，人力不懈，亦可樂觀。溯自七七抗戰以來，華北華中華東各地相繼淪陷，國貨銷區被日貨所奪，此後應走向何處拓展，實為必須急予研究之要題，而將來如何收復已失之銷區，亦必先自準備，茲分一方面研究之：</p>
<p>（一）關於製造方面者，目前上海租界方面之國貨工廠，漸見眾多，則大都因向在華界區域，其有未被人佔據者，則撩撥燼餘，雖一木一鐵，一輪一軸，都視珍品，倘加拂拭修配，未嘗不可使用而生產，否則貨棄於地，徒屬暴殄天物，且以租界中之國貨生產，經國貨團體證明，經濟部財政部猶視為國貨，凡運入內地，並不以淪陷區貨物待遇，故租界中國貨工廠有畸形發展；至於在虹口區域中，或在南市閘北，迫於特殊勞力，工廠之經濟及行政權無法保持完整者，則自屬例外，惟一切主要之國貨工業，則胥已遷至香港與西南各省，在四川之重慶自流井，湖南之辰溪，廣西之桂林，雲南之昆明各地，於經濟部指導之下，新設機器廠紡織廠化學工業廠電機廠繅絲廠蔴紡廠絲織廠水泥廠造紙廠等，均已次第設置，或在建廠，或已裝機，或已出貨，無不於極經濟極敏速之姿態下活躍進行；蓋西南各地各種原料非常豐富，人工低廉，人性敦樸，於此設廠，實視東南為妙，昔日東南之貨，運至西南，時間上運輸上皆不經濟，此後抗戰，尤須充實資力，則就地取材，製成貨品，實足資益國家經濟，以增抗戰火力，至於香港方面，因其為無稅之港，遙望南洋，一蓋可航，僑胞外商，雲集於此，自大上海淪陷以後，遂成東方第一商港，故製造業設廠於此，不特運輸便利，抑且易於脫售，尤易向南洋方面進取，是以各種國貨工廠亦都分其人力財力，在港經營一切，其已配置成立之廠，亦復　多。</p>
<p>（二）關於運銷方面者，以目前國貨工業商品銷售之對象，當然為西南及南洋二方面，而西南各省近來需要國貨，尤為殷切，重慶成都昆明貴陽桂林今已設有國貨公司，所銷貨物，今猶大都自上海方面運去，惟軍興以來，交通本極梗阻，初猶恃粵漢路至漢口，而運輸至重慶，自廣州失陷，遂改趨廣州灣，由公路通渝，一方面仍由滇越鐵路而至昆明，再分趨川黔桂湘，將來敘昆鐵路告成，則由海防至川，其運輸時間必益經濟，不特進口各貨可以源源供給，而西南國貨工業品之對外貿易，亦必逐漸增加，至於南洋各埠，則華僑愛國心異常熱烈，渴望國貨之輸往，不自今日為始，而七七抗戰以後，對國貨愛護尤倍往日；惟對改頭換面，或魚目混珠之國貨，則排斥亦烈，凡有國貨輸往，檢別極嚴，不容稍有含糊影　，但香港華人以粵胞為多，握商業權威者，亦屬粵人，故經相關華商總會證明者，無勿信任，是以國貨工廠設港，實較設滬為佔優勢，蓋近水樓台，易使香港華商總會及中華廠商聯合會就近視察，而易於辦理證明手續者也，至於香港華人，以前因環境關係，對於國貨尚少認識，但最近則以愛國心切，亦均樂用國貨，是以香港新設國貨公司，其營業亦復非常發達。</p>
<p>華北華中華東之商業，現為日貨因軍事關係而獨佔，則國貨工商業之收復銷區，亦將待至華軍收復失地之時，惟國貨工商業有關國家整個經濟之盛衰，自須別謀拓展，西南諸省，昔固偏僻，今已變為中國軍事政治經濟之重心，且原料豐富，人民勤勞，於此開發工廠，實為最宜，製造商品，則運至國外，取得外滙，以充實持久抗戰之活力，亦最為得計，南洋路近民富，且華僑愛國心重，以國貨輸往，必尤易於脫售，最近中交二行及各商業銀行先後在新加坡巴城馬尼拉諸地各設分支行，則國貨工商品運往南洋，並多一種經濟上之援助，金融周轉，更覺事半功倍，惟有一點，國貨工商業所不可不注意者，則為產品必須合於經濟部規定之國貨標準，否則將不為南洋華僑所歡迎也，至於上海租界內之國貨工商業，雖一時氣象蓬勃，畸形發展，但在此環境之下，終非樂土，望愛國人士勿貪近利，勿圖苟安，振作精神，往西南及南洋發展，以待時機之轉變，而此時際之輪，今已發軔，目的之達，固非遙遠，有識之士，殆不觀望者歟。</p>
<h3>戰前之上海市建設（五）</h3>
<p>— 琳琅</p>
<p>浦東水廠　浦東沿江一帶，地作狹長形，本係洋商碼頭倉庫之所在。比年以來，工廠林立，人煙稠密，對於給水一項，因向無自來水之設備，至感困難，洵為市政上一大缺點。民國二十三年十月，市政府令飭市興業信託社，籌備建築浦東自來水。當由該社擇定南京路外灘對江志之龍碼頭，為建築水廠之地點，並向德尚西門子洋行訂購水管等一切材料。於二十六年夏季出水，水質純良潔淨，壓力亦足，成績頗佳。浦東自來水廠廠基面積約七·〇四畝，自來水管長度，就口徑一〇〇公厘以上之幹管言，約一一，〇〇〇公尺。消防籠頭四十五隻。其製水設備，大要如次：進水管一根，內徑五〇〇公厘，渾水唧機兩座，全電氣離心力。出水量一號機每小時四〇六·八立方公尺；二號機六七三·二立方公尺，共一，〇八〇立方公尺。混凝沉澱池兩隻，容量共約二，一七五立方公尺。加氣機一架。清水池兩隻，容量共約三，六五〇立方公尺。清水唧機兩座，全電氣離心力，出水量，一號機每小時三六〇立方公尺；二號機五六一·六立方公尺，共九二一立方公尺。出水管一根，內徑五〇〇公厘。</p>
<p>市輪渡　上海市黃浦兩岸來往交通，向賴舊式之渡船，不但遲緩，抑且危險。民國十六年，上海市政府成立以來，對於此浦江東西之交通問題，即加以注意。當時之輪渡，隨同塘工局移交，初歸市政府浦東辦事處暫管，同年十二月，該辦事處撤銷，乃由公用，財政，兩局會同接辦，成立浦東輪渡管理局。翌年七月，為統一事權起見，復由財政局原營業部份，一併移交公用局接管，隨將浦東輪渡管理處，改稱浦江輪渡管理處。十九年終，公用局依照辦事細則，改為輪渡總管理處。二十二年八月上海興業信託社成立，接辦上海市輪渡業務，改稱上海市輪渡管理處。該處所辦之輪渡，分長渡與對江渡·（一）長渡－滬松綫，由上海直達吳淞，其重要之進展如次：民國十八年，建造東溝碼頭。訂造新式第一·二號渡輪，此為上海市自建新式渡輪之發軔。並於東溝碼頭，建築四十噸柴油池一所。十九年，添造第三第四兩號渡輪。二十年，建築慶甯寺及高橋兩浮碼頭，將航綫展長至高橋。因渡輪添置後，燃料日增，又添建五百五十噸柴油池一所。二十一年，開駛淞滬專班及高橋聯班。總管理處之房屋，亦於是年建造。二十二年建造西渡碼頭，及五號渡輪。二十三年，渡輪展駛吳淞。二十四年，建造北京路碼頭，及添造六號渡輪。（二）對江渡，分：慶定綫，由北京路碼頭起，至浦東慶甯寺為止，每二十分鐘來回一次。其威綫，來往於浦東其昌棧及浦西威賽公碼頭間。東東綫，由浦西東門路（十六浦）至浦東之東昌路。春北綫，由北京路碼頭至對江之春江碼頭。塘董綫，由董家渡至塘橋路口為止。市輪渡管理處所辦之副業如次：（一）高橋公共汽車，開始於二十年春，二十二年展駛高橋海濱浴場。（二）水上飯店，在北京路碼頭上層，設備整潔，風景優美。（三）高橋海濱浴場，利用高橋海濱之沙灘，闢為浴場，為夏季之消暑勝地。（四）解送海輪乘客，始於二十四年，與各大輪船公司訂約，辦理解送來客事務。（五）乘涼夜班及租船。開始於二十年，利用停航船隻，作為江上納涼之用。綜觀市興業信託社接辦市輪渡以來，拓展航綫，開闢碼頭，添造渡輪等，一切事業，年有進展。在上海市各種建設中，別樹一幟。</p>

<h3>上海公共租界之犬政（下）</h3>
<p>— 陳斌棠</p>
<p>（乙）麻痹性之狂犬病－患此種病之狗，日見衰弱，後退麻痹，牙床下垂，口流涎沫，喉內之肌肉亦麻痹，通常誤為骨梗喉間，因之狗主常為搜尋骨之所在，其危險可想而知。</p>
<p>或曰患狂犬病之狗大都畏水，然吾人絕不能一次為徵候，因有狂犬或苦渴而狂飲等情耳。</p>
<p>狂犬病之潛伏期　所謂潛伏期者，即自人或夠傳染狂犬病之時起，至病狀初發現之時止，此種時期常屬無定，或甚短促，或延至六個月或六個月以上，此病之發展，恒歷時甚久，致使養狗之人，對於其不信，殊不知狗或已於數月前被咬，或其他原因而傳染矣。</p>
<p>發覺性畜患狂犬病後之適當辦法　狗患溫熱或其他病症時，或發生前述各種初期現象，厥為將該狗立即隔離，或送往醫院診治，如此辦理，即使未發現狂犬病，可使免成重病，設或病勢已重，亦可免發生複雜之變化，有時家畜患狂犬病三日至六日後，輒往僻處而死，故患病之家畜，倘見失蹤即事有可疑，宜向工部局衛生處請示辦法，或遇有可疑之牲畜，即可將此項牲畜，送往獸醫處檢驗，或報告最近之捕房，免費轉送衛生處狗類察驗所察驗。</p>
<p>已被狗咬後之辦法　（甲）家用消毒藥之無效－黏性油膏，樹脂，或家用消毒藥均屬無效，其他如石灰酸，來沙面，碘酒，及硝酸銀等均經試驗，無甚效果。</p>
<p>（乙）臨時急救法－可先用克羅拉民替（Chloramine　T.）之溶液洗淨傷處，再用硝酸腐蝕法，此法雖性質猛烈，令人不快，但為必要之治療法，且必須由醫生施行之（按克羅拉民替為一種錠劑，各藥房均有出售，用以救急，頗為便利，且時或效用甚鉅，養狗之人，自應在家中儲備是項防腐藥劑，被咬後立即使用此藥，當於施行灸灼時有所裨助，增加一重保障）。</p>
<p>（丙）速至醫生處或工部局衛生處立即使行巴斯德治療（Pastenr　Treatment）治療時期為二十天倘未曾被狂畜所咬而曾為狂畜之唾液所囑及者，則十五天可矣，每天注射一針，凡本埠公共租界之居民，工部局可予免費治療；倘非界內居民則須按下列規定出資療傷：　二十四天（二十四針）法幣七十元　十五天（十五針）法幣三十元</p>
<p>（丁）認期咬人之牲畜，並報告就近捕房，將該畜送往察驗或至可靠之獸醫處檢驗，但切勿擊殺之，緣如擊斃，須至少待十四日，方能斷定其是否染有狂犬病，而被咬者或須受本可不必施行之巴斯德治療法；若將該牲畜活擒，則患否狂犬病，當於數日內即能發現</p>
<h3>養狗人應知各節</h3>
<p>試觀上文所述，養狗人應知曉下列各項：</p>
<p>一，狗舍附近須備置手套。</p>
<p>二，使狗服藥，或弄狗嘴時，須戴手套。</p>
<p>三，與狗玩戲時，須防其傷及汝手，避勿為狗所舔。</p>
<p>四，注意狗之健康。</p>
<p>五，注意狗之訓練，所養之狗，如果易咬行人，試一計及被咬之可怕結果，狗主殊缺乏公德心，莫斯為甚。</p>
<p>狂犬慎防之種種　凡未戴狗套之狗，或野狗，遇有亂跑之狗務須遠避，至於所愛家畜之健康尤宜注意，於處理患病之家畜時，務戴手套。最後為預防狂犬計，其最良方法，莫過預防注射，在日本已試有成效，狗主為所養之狗，每年舉行注射一次。此種注射非特有預防之效，且絕無危險。</p>
<h3>結論</h3>
<p>上海公共租界之犬政，可謂甚佳，至於所需執照，亦為各國通行，而欲捕捉無主路犬，實以該項犬類，無人照顧，輒為瘋狗病之傳帶者，故工部局不得不出此，至於優良種犬，則捕房當爲代覓新主，加以上海護畜會之設立，可云租界之犬類，已受極優待。今歲本埠人口特增為數十年來未有，而工部局接衛生處瘋狗病之治療者，為數大見減少，此乃由上海已成孤島，四週均有歐美軍隊佈防，流蕩租界外之狗，均不得而入，故瘋狗病者自然減少，有此可得明徵，即無主路犬，當即消滅之，否則界內之瘋狗病當無從絕跡矣。</p>

<h3>沉湎聲色　耗精過度的性健法</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<p>尋花問柳，沾花惹草，幾為青年人的通病，這由於青年涉世未深，意志不堅，稍一放任，便躭溺過度，此在心曠神怡，無所事事的公子哥兒，雖照樣能斷傷衰弱，然因生活環境稍優，較一般勞心勞力的職業青年見害遲緩，這因人的精力不能多方面的消耗，常見商店裏的青年夥計，一旦沉湎聲色，日間勞於工作，乏累不堪，精力之減退愈速，若再加上營養不足乃至睡眠不足時，則結果惟有加速死亡而已，故學校青年與職業夥計，若受淫書淫畫的誘惑而自瀆成癖者，精神與肉體常顯可怕的病態，不能支持長久的端傷，短期間內即顯遺精，早洩，腦弱，失眠，發育不全，面色蒼白，食慾不振等弊者，其後雖將荒淫之念戒絕，但在營正常夫婦生活時，顯較常人射精過早，患者本身非常痛苦，為彌補此種缺憾起見，惟有尋求增強性力的方法，醫學薄弱面無智識的人，受社會不道德藥商之春藥宣傳，而墮入不拔之深淵，畢生幸福，喪失殆盡，故以春藥療治性萎者，不啻飲鴆而止渴，後悔難追！</p>
<p>所以對於本症的療法，最要緊的是恢復本人的健康，增加生理上所產生的血液，使沉湎聲色所消耗而枯竭之精血，從速恢復，在最近所發現的市上各種內分泌劑，足有此種功用者，除德國生理學家梅倫博士所發明之動物精質製劑男用「補體康」之外，再無可供吾輩醫師合意之內服劑了。余為腎病專科醫師在俄國列甯醫學院實習時，曾將一百四十五例之同病患者，給以各種腺質製劑，意在決定何種藥劑有超過他種之治效，經過三星期後，在上述諸患者中之大部分，其性力增加程度，異乎微弱，而在用「補體康」治療之一組，則顯示精血之平均增加，計每日有百分之二又四分之一。易言之，「補體康」已證明優於　常各種補劑所含之補血生精成分近廿倍，而優於同樣之腺質製劑者近十倍半，試問市上再有何種能合於吾輩醫師之治療標準製劑乎？</p>
<p>「補體康」分男女用兩種，男用有補腦，補血，補精，補腎之功，女用除有補腦，補血等功效之外，更有調經種子之效。在婦科上應用頗廣。</p>

<h3>淋病治驗寫真</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師</p>
<p>膀胱炎得治</p>
<p>患者嚴川石君，甯波人，家新閘路，新患淋病，因治療失當，忽劇變為膀胱炎，排尿困難，恒苦不能排盡，少腹疼脹，尿液污濁，夜間且有遺精，精液中混有膿血，勢將變成精囊炎，急求余治療，除洗滌膀胱外，即囑其購服德國彼德博士所發明最新之淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，以撲滅淋菌，而促炎癥之消散，使排尿舒暢，尿液澄清，則疼痛遺精之患自止。約服四瓶，即見全愈。嗣後得嚴君來函，謂返里後，又向當地醫院用血清檢查，無琳毒反應。證明完全根治。身體完全恢復健康。而內子之淋病，亦承貴醫師介紹服用「克淋儂」，一方外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥，每晚臨睡前按法使用，至三星期後，亦完全治愈，患夫婦二人深為感激云。</p>
<p>體虛白濁</p>
<p>患者蕭式文君。住白爾部路，年廿六歲，未婚，因早年誤犯手淫，後又患淋病，因此身體虧弱，病益難愈，睾丸隱痛，小便短促，尿後見血。且又遭遺精失眠，頭目眩暈等癥，相繼而作。神形憔悴不堪，後延余治療，診之，乃體虛而兼後尿道炎也。隨即投以「克淋儂」，以　滅久伏之淋菌，使炎癥範圍，繼續縮小，故淋菌得以絕跡，同時又令購服「補體康」，以治其失眠，並強其體力，止其遺精，於四星期內完全治愈。</p>
<h3>肺病精神快慰之重要性</h3>
<p>— 盛在強醫師</p>
<p>關於肺病之治法，其確具卓效者，除服藥靜養實無他途，此時患者雖極短距離之步行，亦非所宜，故離鎮日靜臥亦不為過。同時宜平心靜氣，悠悠自適，勿遞陷於失望而萌悲觀之念，此病關於精神作用甚大，家人或朋友宜多方慰藉之，或於宗教上求自慰，凡能精神愉快者，於治療上收效甚巨</p>
<p>此外對於內服藥，以求功能止咳化痰，搜殺結核菌為最要，市上肺病藥中有此功效者，首推德國「補肺拿爾」，余為肺病專科醫師，三十年來之經驗所知，「補肺拿爾」確為治癆特效劑，特錄而出之。</p>
<h3>切忌敷衍一時的遺精療法</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>遺精不論　在婚前罹患，或在婚後爆發，均有其不同之弊害，蓋在婚前發現者，每易阻礙發育，如在十六七齡之青年，若遺精過頻，生殖器之發育定難長大。如在婚後者，愈為可慮，因照一般的情理而論，凡患輕微之遺精癥，結婚之後，本可減少，甚至全不發現，然倘仍有遺精，其腎虧衰弱之程度可想而知，此種人若再不極力治療，不僅神經衰弱愈陷愈深，且早洩陰萎，子嗣可慮。人生之幸福全無，為彌補此種缺憾起見，應有從事於對癥療法的必要。</p>
<p>在社會上有所謂「固精片」者，其實不過是僅有效一時（？）的劣質藥劑，祗能對遺精敷衍一時，且流弊百出，有損消化機能，余為性病專科醫師，多年來對遺精一癥之治法實驗有素，其功效確實者，首推法國遺精特效藥「耐而斯遺精片」如能再服睾丸精質製劑男用「補體康」以補虧損，則見效尤速，且能增精補血，返老還童。</p>
<p>淋病座談</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師述</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>………淋病中損失男女兩性姙娠力者究用何法補救？</p>
<p>………捨棄一般非科學療法及守衛生改用特之療法！</p>
<p>精囊本爲儲藏精子之所，可稱爲生殖之主要原素，此處如被淋菌侵入，則純潔之精虫被其擾亂，尤易傳染女性，而起子宫淋或卵巢，喇叭管炎等，此症在急性精囊炎時，尤易發見。故在急性淋時，不可不加以注意也。患者每於直腸或會陰部有異物壓廹之感及疼痛，又有疼痛性之尿意頻數，及射精時之痛楚，時或尿道搔養與快美之感覺，因陰莖繼續之勃起，此時之射精，痛楚增劇，其所射出之精液，與血液相混合，偶而亦有發熱，甚者呈憂鬱或興奮之狀態。因此淋病患者，往往陷於進退維谷之境</p>
<p>患者對於此症之形成，在余臨床上觀之，並不以爲可怖。而正是一個容易治愈之時期。不過如治療不得其法，或者病家自己延誤，則反而被陷入困境。余在臨床上二十餘年之經騐，凡患急性淋毒精囊炎，囑其絶對安静，並用德静電療法，直撲精囊間之淋菌，並投以內服藥「克淋儂」發揮之抗淋噬菌作用所殺滅，故服用之後，十二小時內，即能將所有炎症全部消散。一星期內，此困難而不易治之急性精囊炎，遂完全根本解决，徹底治愈，永不再發，並恢復生殖力矣　診時：上午十時至下午六時自即日起每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角。</p>

<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤市謂平平、同業相聚議論、况蜀省重慶日機轟炸劇烈、人氣乏勁、故開價與上日不相上下、二十支雙馬現貨價爲四百二十七元半、一霎間買風陡起、掮客呌買聲驟振、售價徐徐上升、漲起三元、外棧現貨做到四百三十元零五角、多說申新九廠之打包機損壞不能打包、紗號多無派到門票現貨、因之掀起買風、迨至收盤略回下一二元、雙馬價爲四百二十八元半、棧單價爲四百二十一元半、午後開盤和平、旋以某紗號來收進雙馬及雙地球二三百包、市價重振、回漲二元、收盤價變馬現貨爲四百三十元、棧單價爲四百二十二元半、查全日各帮買去統計一千五百十包、行情二十支雙馬漲二元半、特金城漲三元、雙地球漲二元半、牧羊平、惟三二支天女。雙馬單紗漲八元光景、廠方由崇信廠開出二十支大發七百包、價爲三百九十五元、六月至八月期貨凈盤現鈔票、今日有棉紗一百六十件運天津、二十件運烟台、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、同行　八六〇　內地　七五　汕頭一　五五</p>

<h3>美棉出口津貼　尚未絕望　本外棉交易停滯</h3>
<p>外棉市價紐的棉市、晨初即形活躍、孟買及利物浦來電俱漲、因之引起新買戶、此後雖有一部份多頭獲利了結、但市面不受影響、華盛頓方面發展良好、一般對出口津貼之恐懼者、亦漸見减少、査美棉連日高漲之原因、乃貸款棉放出無期、市上現貨奇缺所造成、然出口津貼之問題、尙未絕望也、昨日紐的漲六七磅音印度連同預測不動、埃及不動折合法幣、除美棉及巴西棉父漲八角外、餘均無更動、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、全市殊爲靜寂、各方注意力均集中於騐取最近到貨之棉樣、同業間亦無交易聞、茲將昨口棉市折合送廠價列下、</p>
<p>本國棉生意依然沉悶、各方絕無發展氣象、存底日見匱乏、廠方雖有進意、不是價格奇昂、就是貨品身骨太遜、以致交易停滯惟外棉交易時時而斷、蘇北來源殊微、途中被剝削重重、販運商卽困苦、而不能賺錢、大家視爲畏途竟有狼虎之懼、碼頭到貨、計白包花叫百三十包、木架子六百五十三包、又北沙來一百七十件、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>

<p>本埠絲銷暢展、惜美市未能配合振動耳、故昨祇法莊動辦、白廠七星等級一三——一五售開二〇二五元、似可再望盤升、XB級價一八四〇元、計漲起二十元、法莊洋行信孚仕昌述豐等共進一百五十擔、截止下午、據傳白廠七八分美銷已以一八九〇元新高價售開、但此價在目前似甚少可能或係英倫點品交易、此點尙須待諸證實、</p>

<h3>糧食粉麥絕少進展</h3>
<p>粉市頗見平靜、査南北帮客銷、自日前廉價一度活動後、父巳多日未見動銷、蓋成交之貨、迄今尙有裝淸、故新交易數量甚微、而北洋帮方面、對於下脚粉需要頗佳、二號粉則嫌價昂、一再擯小、要求低價一角、而廠方一時尙難接受、故市面仍在擯持中、廠盤迄未更變化、但據客帮消息、二號粉客盤已貶至四元五角匯劃、廠方則尙未承認、統市交易除客帮成交外、本街及內地各處零批、亦有　萬餘包、價仍爲四元四角之現鈔、今日有麵粉二萬四千包、運往天津、又一千包、運烟台、又五百包、運寗波、</p>
<p>麥來源無多、因近日內地產價略見回升、而巾市則受種種環境影響、售價反廉、致販戶袖手、且各粉廠進胃久居呆滯、日商方面、近來交易亦見淸閑、究緣新麥上市漸近、陳麥已屆落令時期、故市面况寂異常、聞本街方面繼續做開江北麥二三百包、價仍爲六元、小麥今日有五百包運往寗波、</p>
<h3>粳米晨市　續吿猛落　囤戶活動復轉平定　香港機元進十九元</h3>

<p>客秈存多到湧、最近各批裝到四萬餘包、市面逐决下趨、前以囤戶出籠、允見慘跌、昨日晨市依然軟弱、旋以貨方嫌小不肯再脫、而行囤則趁低吸收、市乃疲而轉站、結果行情與前市無出入、午後反見帶緊、即西貢現洋米售價亦復喊高外、蓋存底旣枯、定價又昂、人心乃多向上、惟洋元米存到兩旺、續小二三角、昨香港機兀米已跌進十九兀、價開十八元八九角云、</p>

<p>生油祗成交膠州油二百五十件、路貨價爲二十九元、比前市亦小二元外、潛勢平庸之格、</p>
<p>二十六　日自天津來豆油三百件、寧波來茶油七十五件、皮油一千件、</p>
<h3>豆餅頗多起伏　六月期貨交易繁盛</h3>
<p>豆餅實銷在二元七八角之限價辦　稍有問津、故市况未呈寂寞、昨開大連源記餅三千片、價爲二元七角至二元七角三分、雜牌餅一千片、二元六角九分七厘半、行情比上日市又跌二三分、六月份期餅交易、依然繁盛、全日市况頗多起伏、晨初開盤即小二三分、計訂源記價爲二元七角三分、雜牌二元六角五分半、入後買氣旺盛、行情步步高昂、中途雖遭挫折、（源記最低價見二元七角、雜牌二元六角四分、）轉瞬復吿上騰、（源記最高峯達二元七角半、雜牌二元七角一分、）但結果仍屬下游、源記收盤價爲二元七角二分、雜牌爲二元六角八分七厘半、兩共統計成交二萬八千餘片云、</p>

<h3>海味　屯溪香菇趨跌</h3>
<p>香菇各地來貨不寂、此門底存漸厚、以時近霉　荀不過焙、即須　入冷氣棧、然前者必須虧耗重量、而後者外費昂貴、似俱難合算、故昨日開出屯　菇一批、比前市突跌二三十　成盤如屯菇大片二百八十元六角至二百八十元六角、　菇二百七十六元、平莊二百三—八元八角至二百三十七元七角</p>

<p>黑鐵坯子、前因到貨奇多而各路銷胃頓吿呆滯、致市盤一度落軟、但昨因天津帮起而動辦、更有本埠熱水瓶廠·邱鐵廠等亦隨之搜納、故其標準一時忽然蓬勃、查全市開出達　百餘箱之譜、購去者天津帮二百箱、本街各廠家一百餘箱、刻市行情二百磅貨每箱售三十元〇五角、二千磅貨每箱（以二百磅計算）售三十三元、均比前市好起一元數角、</p>

<h3>到內地去的新途徑</h3>
<p>— 敬</p>
<p>自從浙閩粤各省口岸，如溫州，寗波，福州，汕頭，廣州灣等埠，轉入內地去的交通發生阻礙以來，凡是要到內地去，除掉取道法屬越南外，再沒有更安全更迅速的了。但是假使要經過第二國而到我國內部，其手續亦相當的麻煩。第一步，先要向我國政府機關請領獲照，第二步要向第二國的領事署請求加蓋允許過境簽字，然後方才好購票啟程。依據最近情形，在上海辦理上述手續，其所費時間，是相當可觀的，大概非五六星期不能辦妥。假使在香港辦理出國手續，父覺得化費過巨，所以一般經濟能力較爲薄弱，同時又急需到內地去的人們，有上述的各項難題擱在面前，的確是很難解決的。作者爲謀便利大衆旅客起見，所以覺得有調查除掉取道海防以外的另一條到內地去的交通綫的必要。現在據調査所得，取道汕頭，轉入內地，本來因爲揭陽至豐順間的一段公路，被當局自動破壞後，交通暫時中斷，現在聞該段可以水道代之，使全綫交通，仍不發生影響。茲將其詳細情形分述如下：</p>
<p>一、上海至油頭　有太古及怡和兩家輪船公司的船隻，直接開往，每星期的各開一二决，需時的二日餘可達。船票票價，分大菜間每位國幣七十五元或九十元，官艙四十元，房艙二十八元，吊舖二十元，統艙十六元等數級。</p>
<p>二、汕頭至潮安　可乘坐火車，僅一小時半可達。</p>
<p>三、潮安至松口　小火輪每日下午三點鐘由潮安開出，次日下午七時半，可抵松口。</p>
<p>四、松口至梅縣　每日上午六時起，有公路汽車開往梅縣。僅需二小時可達梅縣，每日行車决數，四次與五次不等</p>
<p>五、梅縣至興寗每日上午十時開車一决，下午一時到達與寗。</p>
<p>六、興寗至韶關（印曲江）此段有公路汽車，隨時有車開行，約二日可達韶關。</p>
<p>綜觀上述各點，由上海到韶關，行程不過十日，到了韶關之後，就可以視目的地而取決應走的路綫了。從汕頭到韶關間的旅費，的需國幣四十餘元，假使要到重慶等地去的，就可以由韶關直接乘粤漢鐵路火車到長沙，車行一日可達，三等票價爲六元零五分。再由長沙乘公路汽車，經常德，沅陵，獨山，黔江，南川等地而達離重慶僅八四公里的綦江，行程五日，票價五十七元六角半。由綦江再乘西南公路局汽車到海棠溪，僅三小時可達，票價國幣三元九角餘。假使要到桂省去，就可由韶關乘火車到衡陽，車行的七小時餘可達，三等票價爲三元九角半，再循湘桂鐵路至桂林，特別快車每日下午九點十分由衡陽西站開，第二日下午一點五十分可抵桂林，三等票價每位國幣五元二角五分，由桂林即可轉往各地。</p>
<p>話又要說回來了，若要取道汕頭曲江而到內地去，對於年靑的單身旅客，尙可一試，假使是携有眷屬及多量行李者，則不方便，允其使旅客感到困難的，就是該段商民的言語，是不十分容易懂的，這亦是行旅上的一個問題。所以到內地去，比較安全，穩速的還是以取道越南爲最妥善呢！</p>
<h3>川滇東路</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>內地的交通建設，尤其是公路方面，實是一日千里地展發，其所以要加緊建設的緣因，無非是要便利行旅，開發庫藏及振興實業，還有其他的作用，更不用說了。最近又有川滇東路落成的消息，怎不使人興奮呢？</p>
<p>川滇東路是連接成渝公路與西南公路西路黔滇段的一條公路，它的起點是成渝公路上的中心站隆昌。離開重慶的二百公里，終點是雲南境內的霑益天生橋，離開黔滇公路上之曲靖站僅十餘里，曲靖到昆明，尙有一百七十餘公里。它的路綫自從四川隆昌起，經過瀘縣，納谿，叙永，而達川黔分界點之赤水河，此段距離共二七四·三公里。再由赤水河經過畢節威寗而達黔滇分界點之杉木簣，此段距離共三六五·三公里，再由雲南邊境杉木簣經過宜威而達霑益的天生橋，此段距離一六〇·八公里，全程總長八〇〇·四公里。</p>
<p>這條公路大都是山路，工程亦相當偉大，這區域裏，苗夷佔着很大的數目，行旅並不如昆明貴陽重慶間來得便利穩妥。一般人以爲由重慶到昆明去，取道川滇東路，一定可以比取道貴陽來得近些，因爲川滇東路衹不過是三角形上的一根弦，不是可以省走其餘的兩邊嗎？但是事實並不是如此簡單。假使一個從成都出發到昆明去的旅客，走川滇桌路或能省去一些路程。如從重慶到昆明，不是要加上重慶到隆昌間的二百公路，霑益到昆明間的一百八十三公里，連同川滇公路的本身八百餘公里，總共是一一八三公里。同時由重慶到貴陽是四八八公里，貴陽到昆明六六二公里，合起來僅有一一五〇公里，比較起來由重慶到昆明，遝是取道貴陽，可以近一些呢！</p>
<p>至於貨運方面，由滇入川的貨物到了瀘縣之後，就可以裝船運渝，當然比公路上運輸利便得多，總之川滇東路的落成，很是價得注意的。</p>

<h3>遠東不在世界內麽？</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>英王近在美大陸廣播演說，略謂，歐亞兩洲之文明，今確處於驚風駭浪中，不列顛帝國最大任務之一，厥為使帝國成協和兩世界之連鎖。此語不差，世界內任何一處發生戰事，具有牽一髮而動全身之勢，所謂一處安，百處安。</p>
<p>現在應該決與法蘇訂立三強互助同盟，據謂，此種協定，僅適用於歐洲方面，並不推行及於遠東。此何為故，難道遠東戰事，絕與歐洲沒有關係麼？歐洲戰事，絕與遠東一點沒有關係麼？遠東不在世界之內麼？爲什麽獨將遠東出外？</p>
<p>劈開中國不談，即以蘇聯的地位而言，其大部份不在遠東麼？何以歐洲方面有事，則須蘇聯參加，假定蘇聯在遠東有事，難道英法就袖手旁觀麼？假定蘇聯在遠東有事，英法兩國，亦須出手幫忙，則怎樣說此種協定並不推行於遠東呢？這種道理，不知在幾千幾百條歪理中是那一條，所謂依據絕對平等原則，平在何處？</p>
<h3>義賣運動在復旦</h3>
<p>— 人甬</p>
<p>公子哥兒充報童</p>
<p>千金小姐呼賣花</p>
<p>『義賣，義賣！』這呼聲點綴了悲壯的五月。像獅子在吼，像朔風再刮！震動到每一個角落裏。</p>
<p>這偉大的呼聲吹到了復旦：五月十六日，女同學會舉行「黃花義賣」；第二天，校刊社舉行「校刊義賣」！</p>
<p>十六日早上，女同學們把她們手製的黃花開始義賣，是一種紙製的小花，是一種傷感的黃色。據佈告上說，是爲了紀念沉痛的五月，所以製就「黃」花。不過是一個早晨，賣到了一百二十九元光景。這是一個嘗試，這嘗試沒有叫人失望。</p>
<p>「賣花女」，這一向被詩人作家歌詠的人物，這一會當真正值得頌贊了。這是一件破天荒的事：大家閨秀在賣花，一個朝晨賣了一百外！詩人將說：「偉大，這偉大的一群賣花女！」</p>
<p>「賣花女」叫了一個早上，第二天「報童」到了。五月十七日，校刊社舉行「校刊義賣」。門房邊按放着兩隻方桌，一隻義賣箱，一疊校刊。還有一群臨時「報童」，手裏捧着一疊下課在兜售着他們底無價的刊物。不過是一張四開報，薄薄的一張半紙，竟有人慨付二十元；最小的一毛錢，也已比本報（申報）大五倍了。晚上結算一下，售得大洋二百六十多！雖不曾真正調查過，猜想起來，一定打破了賣報記錄了吧？</p>
<p>校刊社園丁先生說：這是一種啟蒙作用，希望以後有更多的舉行。是的，孤島同學們，響應吧！在學生界發動義賣運動。戲法人人會變，各有巧妙不同。來，想出些花樣來義賣義買！義賣者是出力，義買者是出錢，這是我們當前的一條愛國大道！（義賣獻金）</p>
<h3>縫繡義賣展覽會</h3>
<p>— 飛燕</p>
<p>出品以兒童的西式衣服居多　四部縫紉機器表演機繡方法　昨日上午已經訂售一百餘元　最後兩天希望各界踴躍購買</p>
<p>對於女子自己縫紉自己衣服一點，我想誰也不會反對，以節約講，以經濟便利講，女孩兒家自己能動手裁製縫紉，當然比拿給裁縫去做要便利得多。因為過慣了慵懶，舒適，奢侈的小資產階級的女孩兒家，在這個時候，自己能夠動動針綫，縫紉衣裳的，實在已不多見。一方面，市上各種東西都有，祗要有錢，什麽都買得到；兩一面，現代女性，平日很少拿起針綫，這也是事實。</p>
<p>據人說起，有幾個摩登女性（如在交際上很活動的女性），她們連自己襪子破了，都不肯縫上一針，類似這一種摩登女性的「美德」，我們當然是願意大家糾正的。</p>
<p>但是，我們也並不絕對主張，女性們必需要自己能縫裁衣服，如使爲了生活，專門做一個縫紉刺繡的專家，這當然又是例外。</p>
<p>我意思是：女性們絕對不捏針綫，果然不對，但學習針綫的，在這時候，如像中華女子縫紉的課程以外，我們必需更教給他們現代中國新女性戰　的精神，使她們知道在這些純粹母性的縫紉工作以外，她們必需學習一切戰　女性們，政治上的，軍事上的一切常識，使這些女孩家們，不要以為學習縫紉，是她們最高的目的。</p>
<p>這次傳習所的義賣展覽會，動機當然是好的，能夠拿出所有作品，實行義賣，這也是女性們應該做的事情。（據說職業婦女俱樂部六月底也預備舉行一次縫紉刺繡品的義賣運動）展覽會場是在大新四樓，那裏因為容大塊先生的山水風景畫展還沒有完畢，所以傳習所所佔據的地方只有原來會場的一半。</p>
<p>出品以兒童的西式衣服居多，如工人衣褲，西式女孩兒童衣衫，也有刺繡的被單及檯毯，枕套，絲絨坐墊，…</p>
<p>會場中據任招待，職員，一律都是傅習所女學生。會場中間，更有四部縫紉機器，有四位女生，正在表演機繡方法給參觀的人看。會場最裏面，有訂購衣服及量衣服的　事處，如若主顧們要剪裁某種式樣衣服，當場可以量裁。</p>
<p>最後我和她們會場中的某女招待員，作了如下的問答：</p>
<p>「你們承接外面的衣服麼？」</p>
<p>「做的，但以朋友介紹的居多。」</p>
<p>「工錢怎麼算呢？」</p>
<p>「是連衣料一齊算的，看什麽質料什麽花式，價錢沒有一定。」</p>
<p>「這次義賣，怎麼算法呢？是不是先去成本？比如－，」我指着一塊大被單說，「定價是十塊錢，義賣能拿到多少錢？」</p>
<p>「大概本錢要七八元－。」</p>
<p>「那麼就是百分之二十，十塊錢抽兩塊，作為義賣是不是？」</p>
<p>「是的－；」不過，她對展覽會場看了一眼，「這一次的定價因義賣的關係，比平常價錢稍為高一點，平日定做衣服，還要便宜些。」</p>
<p>我看見會場中的出品，已貼上許多訂購的紅紙條，便再問下去：</p>
<p>「今天已經賣掉很多了吧？」</p>
<p>她想了想才說：</p>
<p>「大約有一百多塊錢吧！」</p>
<p>一個上午，已經訂掉了一百多元，成績還算是好的，但我以義賣單抽百分之二十，似乎太少了一點，我以為，可以加一點完全義賣的出品，這樣，似乎更有意義些。</p>
<p>展覽會期還有兩天，主婦們不妨帶孩子去參觀一下，那裏是不收門票的。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十回　椎髻青裙賢良有母　銀髯翠袖矍鑠是翁</p>
<p>朱愛人道：『趙樂天先生，我也認識他。怎麼你們來了這幾天，不曾告訴我，在火車上遇到他呢。』向儷玉道：『我們下了火車，早把這事，也忘得乾乾淨淨了。在火車中，因為恰恰他坐在我們對面，火車中人擠，他要讓坐給吳君素姊，我們因此搭起話來。他是到無錫去的，我們下車時，他還給我們打招呼，你來接我們時，只怕沒有留意吧？我們早已忘卻，現在因為愛群姊，說出趙樂天先生只有一條腿，還鬧出戀愛的佳話。我們便　然想起：趙樂天這個名字，覺得很熟。又因為愛群姊說　是一條腿，我們便立刻想起了火車上遇著的這位先生了。』朱村長道：『原來你們也只不過一面之交罷了。』這時何儷玉叫急欲知道　，便是這一位獨腳先生，如何的鬧出了戀愛的把戲。還是他給人家去鬧戀愛呢，還是人家戀愛他這個一條腿的人呢？因為戰　為傷殘軍人的婚姻，是頗成了一個問題的。當時在從征時代的青年，都是未完婚者多；甚而至於已經聘定了未婚妻的忠勇志士，爲了自己去抗戰，退了婚的。他說：『匹夷未滅，何以家為？』不要耽誤了人家的青春，教他們去別選良緣的。及至戰爭結束，有的已經為國犧牲，有的也受了重傷，做了個肢體傷殘　人了。但是以一個肢體傷殘的男子而求婚，究竟吃虧一點。我們鄰國的侵略專　者，曾經一度，用強迫手段，要強迫國內的年青女子，無條件的嫁給傷殘的兵士，鬧出了不少悲慘事來，本來那個國家是蔑視女性的，女子已算是男子附屬品。他們把國內的女性，似牲畜一般，在輪船火車上裝來裝去，看看照片，也可以結婚　。但這件事，在吾們中國，戰後也成為一問題的。起初在火車裏，還聽得趙樂天說過：他父母雙亡，沒討過老婆，是個光身漢子，所以當時一無掛慮。現在看起來，他是有家有兒，已經不是孑然一身了吧？因　她便問愛人道：『趙樂天先生聲明戀愛佳話？愛人姊知道嗎？』愛人道：『我不知道，你問愛群好了。』愛群是個心直口快的人，覺得爲了剛纔一句話，惹出她們的問話來了。正是：</p>
<p>自古英雄都好色　本來兒女　多情。（一二）</p>
<h3>「草裙誘春」觀感</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>HONOLULU</p>
<p>米高美公司出品</p>
<p>首先，我想約略敘述一點「草裙誘春」的故事：電影明星馬遜，因為時常被影迷包圍，頗以為苦，很想獲得一個恬靜的假期。恰巧有一個檀島農園主人佐治，和馬遜容貌相似，（洛勃脫楊兼飾）就雙方商議妥當，佐治隨馬遜的經理人杜菲赴紐約，馬遜以佐治名義買掉返檀島。之後，我們當然可以想像得到，由於這「掉包案」而鬧出許許多多笑話。</p>
<p>從這個故事中我們可以看出，劇作者最大的企圖是想熔一切「生意眼」於一爐，讓銀幕下的紳士淑女們有九十分鐘的享樂，－拍腳拍手的轟笑一番。</p>
<p>這里，計開：洛勃脫楊飾兩角，拉手談話，這是攝影技巧方面的。更安插了兩個丑角，喬治彭斯和葛雷絲亞倫，以俏皮話來博取觀眾的轟笑。由於「掉包案」所鬧出來的笑話，自然更可以隨意編排。而「草裙誘春」最主要的，尤其是　　舞后愛麗娜鮑慧兒的　　草裙舞，所謂「玉腿盤旋鮮花顫動，草裙大會春色無遮」，是　取觀眾最大的節目了；於是Honolulu也譯成了多麼動人的「草裙誘春」！</p>
<p>其實，如Yes，My　darling　Daughter　也會抄上「西廂記」的詞句，Honolulu中確實有愛麗娜鮑慧兒的草裙舞，怎不能譯作「草裙誘春」呢？不過，同時我們也可以看出，即使是「大腿齊飛」的色情電影，也到了強弩之末了，否則，爲什麽還需要廣告員更進一步的替它鋪張呢？而這更進一步的鋪張到了「止境」之後，那如何善其後呢？</p>
<p>可是，遺憾得很，在好萊塢色情電影走上窮途末日的時候，我們祖國在抗戰中的電影商人却埋頭趕了上去，用解剖刀在女人身上加以詳細的分析，這是你的恥辱，我的恥辱，還是每一個中國人的恥辱？你說？</p>

<h3>兩個職業劇團的糾紛</h3>
<p>— 維克</p>
<p>希望為整個劇運着想</p>
<p>雙方平心靜氣的諒解</p>
<p>擁有上海劇壇優秀劇人的上海劇藝社，將改為職業劇團的消息，本刊已報道過，但現在據種種方面傳來情報，知道上海劇藝社這一個計劃，顯然已受了阻礙，而仔細去分析內幕，我們發見這中間又是「人事的糾紛」在作祟，怎樣才可以消除劇壇上的人事糾紛與不必要的摩擦呢？我以為，只要大家平心靜氣把事實看清楚，用最溫和的態度，把這一個問題「死結」慢慢解開來，問題是總能解決的。</p>
<p>整個經過情由是這樣：首先劇藝社的計劃是把燕宮舞廳租下來，改為劇藝社經常上演的戲院，璇宮舞廳則搬到辣婓花園去；計劃當然是很好的囖，但「半路上殺出個程咬金」來，把劇藝社的花花幾乎全盤推翻。</p>
<p>這「程咬金」是誰呢？就是中法劇藝學校，這學校的負責人，本來也是劇藝社重要支柱之一。</p>
<p>事情是發展得非常之快的，當上海劇藝社還沒有和辣婓花園談妥以前，中法劇藝學校校長馮執中，很快的和辣婓花園訂下了合同，預備馬上成立一個新的職業劇團。而且規定以後由　仲彝專任負中法劇藝學校，許幸之專任負責最新的職業劇團。</p>
<p>問題就出在這個地方，辣婓花園一租掉，勢必使璇宮舞廳無從搬起，那麼劇藝社預定以璇宮為大本營的計劃，也突然受了阻礙。</p>
<p>這時候，中法劇藝學校幾個負責人受到責難，也是當然的事，於是在這情形之下，不得不用「快刀斬麻」的方法，向中法劇藝學校辭職，來一個「急流勇退」。</p>
<p>這種「釜底抽薪」的辦法，雖然能減少一時過高的熱度，但是這種「撤兵」的辦法，並沒有把問題解決。</p>
<p>在這情形之下，雙方的焦躁和不安也是無可避免的，於是雙方面便決定在　天開了一個大會，並且有某人出面調停這件事。</p>
<p>現在結果究竟如何，一時還不能明瞭，但是有兩點，是很可以確定下來的：</p>
<p>（一）上海劇藝社的　　劇團必須依原來計劃實現。由張執中單槍匹馬組織的中法學校職業劇團，也勢必成立。</p>
<p>（二）至於怎樣去完成這兩個計劃，希望雙方面都能為了中國整個劇運着想，平心靜氣談一談。</p>

<h3>偽君子今明日上演</h3>
<p>— 希同</p>
<p>預演時博得一片笑聲</p>
<p>真是值得一看的好戲</p>
<p>法國十七世紀大戲劇家莫里哀的傑作「偽君子」定於今明兩天在法租界環龍路華龍路西中法大廳堂上演，演出者是滬江大學海燕劇社。</p>
<p>據巴林氏的「法國文學」所說：「莫里哀是一切法國作家中最為世界所熟知的偉大作家，並且也是最能代表法國的。拉風歹納抒情的分子太多，還不及莫里哀足以代表。莫里哀的私生活充滿了荊棘和困苦：他是一個漂泊的演劇者，他最初的觀眾和個人環境很不好。他戲劇是訴之大眾的。他是世界最大的大喜劇家。他的作風有時不大修飾，並且時有缺點，因為作得太快了。但是任怎麼反對他，莫里哀却仍不失其為崇高而又成功的戲劇作家。他的戲完全是為舞台而編的。他的喜劇打動大眾的心。他的喜劇只是在台上說的，而不是在書齋裏看的。就是說現今在台上演起來，也還跟初寫初演時一樣地有力。」</p>
<p>的確莫里哀是富於經驗的劇作家。他自己就是從演戲出身的。路易十四看他戲演得好，繼給他特殊的榮寵。這「偽君子」和他自己的「唐煥」一樣，都是反對一部份偽善的宗教，信仰者的。「偽君子」係針對當時攬權的日休德派的僧侶而發，那時作者是四十二歲，眼見這般僧侶破戒好色，遂憤而寫此，盡　譏諷這些只洗淨杯盤外面的法利賽人。此作發表後，權力在帝王之上的僧侶便禁止演出。後因時事推移，「偽君子」卒被許可上演，因此觀眾也就更加熱烈的歡迎了。所謂戴席甫原文就是偽君子的意思，現在拿來當做劇中的主角的人名。</p>
<p>此次滬江大學演出此劇，有西人蕭姆斯基，　景，史可拉夫人化裝，卡門斯基設計服裝，所以一切都適合於十七世紀的法國服裝和處景，也可看出他們辦事的不含糊。前日舉行預演，如偽君子的聲音沉著顫抖，台步穩練，的確容易惑人；丫頭杜　英演得很活潑，愛密也演得很機警；巡警的幾句話，雖不多，却說得婉轉得體，軟中帶硬，語調亦好。台下始終是一片笑聲。這真是值得一看的好戲。（義賣獻金）</p>
<p>舞國寫影（二四）</p>
<p>— 小田</p>
<h3>舞場人語</h3>
<p>做生意不是一件容易的事，你想，要把人家口袋裏的錢，搬到自己口袋裏來，不是強搶，不是暗偷，不用欺詐手段，要人家甘心情願的從口袋裏摸出來，送到自己手裏，不給人一種相當的利益，成嗎？要給人享受到一種利益，已然要費去許多勞作許多資本。若是方法用得不得當，你雖耗去許多資力，做成了一種利益去給人享受，人家還不願意來享受呢，那時間不但人家口袋的錢不會搬到自己口袋裏，自己口袋裏的錢還不免搬到人家口袋裏去，所以說，吃一行，這由看着那山高，及至到了那山，又看着這山高了。</p>
<p>前些時有幾個事務員從舞場查賬回來，都慨歎着，豔羨着，以為舞場的大班，有好幾千元的賺頭，職員更不用墊本，天天處身在富麗輝煌的房屋裏，聽著陶醉的音樂，妙曼的歌聲，看著淡妝濃抹的妙齡少女，到時候拿工錢，夠多麼寫意。其實這都是他們祗看到舞場的表面，沒有深知內容的緣故，舞場當局，爲了要吸引顧客，不惜費盡心力，日以繼夜，座位不舒適了，顧客不肯來，太寬舒了，多來了客要　到座位不敷，間接就是減少收入，燈光的配置，太亮了妨礙情話，太暗了又妨礙挑選舞伴的視綫，色彩太濃艷了，說俗不可耐，太幽雅了，又說像喪家的飾置，舞池的形式，有喜歡　的，有喜歡長的，地板有喜歡滑的，有的說不可太滑，音樂隊人數越多，自然價錢越貴，但是有有顧客說他太吵，人數少了，自然價錢便宜，顧客又要說太桂花，（　　低劣之意）至於極為舞星，那就更加難服侍了，紅星日進紛紛，可是身價一高，和之所在，別家舞場少不得就要來挖，稍微不周到一點，她就跳槽，黑星呢，舞場又照不到她什麽牌頭，而且一家舞場，總共也沒有幾只好座位，紅星是當然要坐好座位的，所以紅星請多了，就這座位問題，也是夠麻煩的了。</p>

<p>我們姑且拿中華戲曲學校來講，國家不惜以二十餘萬的公帑去創辦和維特該校的進展，但是結果僅僅造就了不到十名的優秀學生，（換句話說就是栽培出來七八位出科的名角）這未免得不償失了。我在上面說過，該校既係舊式科班的變相，那末，這般優秀學生畢業以後也當然去各自組班，希冀和梅蘭芳馬連良等一樣每月能賺上個三五萬的大包銀，享受貴族階級的生活去了。試圖國家拿出數十萬的鉅款請出許許多多的名教師，算是白白替這極少數的七八個人當了牛馬，想想真有些不甚值得呢。還有一說，凡是公家的錢，一定得用到社會人群上，如其這般新伶人日後都能負起移風易俗，改良社會的責任來，這還不失為以喜劇為輔助社會教育的本來宗旨，計令以往教育部和北平再教育局每月那點錢出來補助該校也還不算白費。單怕他們一離了母校之後，就犯了我上邊所說的毛病，祗顧個人享樂，絲毫沒有為社會人群服務的思想，這樣豈不虛耗了國家有用的公帑呢？據聞三年前該校又被程硯秋一派人接收去了，至於程等接辦後有無新的設施，我們尚無所聞見。現在讓我先把該校幾名高材生的名字介紹在下面，並附帶刊登幾張劇照，讀者諸君把他們當做學生看待也可，當做新伶人看待亦無不可。就是海上劇院當局把他們視為他日的台柱子，也　大批的邀請富連成出科弟子南下似的，替院方賺上個三萬五萬的整款，這樣更無不可。不過所怕就是富社與戲校兩方在平市時暗潮頗烈，彼此互相傾軋，各有各的捧場（非捧角，乃係捧社與捧校）團體，因此校與社的生徒就不易合作了。　社根基已深，歷史又久，好幾科的弟子，全都先後南下奏演過，並且還有些打入劇院裏當班底的。倘若戲校裏僅僅出來了三五個人，南下演唱，不但邀不到馬富祿，葉盛蘭，劉連榮，曹連孝等這般好配角，恐怕在上海的班底裏，也許還有人同他們搗亂，所以這也是戲校人才不能南來一顯身手的最大原因。其實像王和霖的唱工老生，王令璐，傅德威的武生，關德咸的紅生，作工老生，趙金蓉，侯玉蘭，宋德珠等的花衫武旦，趙德鈺，蕭德寅等的正凈副凈，也都還說得過去，藝術的高下，也與富社的弟子無所軒輊的。念餘萬公帑造就出的幾個高材生的藝術，上海人却竟無緣一觀，這不能說不是件憾事吧！（二二）</p>

<h3>The Hubei Province Chinese Army Gains a Counter-Encirclement Advantage; The Entire Battle Situation is Under Their Control; Local Intense Battles in Southern and Northern Hubei; Chinese Troops are Strong; Japanese Troops Attacking on Four Routes on the North Bank of the Xinqiang River are Repulsed</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Yu Telegraph, Southern Henan, Central Hubei: Japanese troops are gathered in the Zhe River, Anlu, Dabie Mountains, Yingcheng, Tianmen, Jingshan, and Zhongxiang areas, fighting like cornered beasts. The result of a week of intense fighting is another 2,000 casualties. Chinese guerrilla forces are active near Xinyang, constantly attacking Japanese troops. Local intense battles continue for days in Southern and Northern Hubei, but the Chinese side has strong troop strength. (Special Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Guilin, 25th Morning: Japanese troops advanced on four routes toward the Chinese side at Fengshu Bridge, Longwan Bridge, Yanjia Dashan, Tangjia Paitou, etc. (all located 7 kilometers north of the Xinqiang River), launching fierce attacks. However, they were repulsed by the Chinese army, and the Japanese suffered heavy casualties. One unit briefly charged to Yanjia Paitou on the Chinese side and released smoke screens. The Chinese guards met them head-on. More than twenty people were poisoned, but the Japanese army was still repulsed by the Chinese army. (Special Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Changde: Shashi telephone report: Since Zaoshi was recovered by the Chinese side, Tianmen was surrounded by the Chinese army, and Jingshan was pressured by the Chinese, the Japanese troops in Zhongxiang feel extremely panicked. A large part of them has been retreating towards Jingshan in recent days, seemingly attempting to relieve the siege of Tianmen. (Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Changde: Shashi telephone report: Since Suixian was recovered by the Chinese army on the 22nd, the Japanese troops are trapped in the Dabie Mountains, still attempting to fight like cornered beasts. Now they have again divided into three routes, advancing towards the Chinese side's Suixian Dabie Mountains: one route from Mao Rongpo, one route from Sanligang, and one route from Tanggangdian, totaling six to seven thousand people. They are currently in a stalemate with the Chinese army. (Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) This time, the Japanese troops in Central Hubei launched an all-out northward attack on Sui and Zao, attempting to encircle and annihilate the Chinese field troops in the area on both wings. Unexpectedly, the Chinese army's tactics were superior, and the officers and soldiers fought bravely. The Japanese troops abandoned eight or nine thousand corpses and suffered more than ten thousand wounded, gaining nothing. The battle's progress is published as follows: At the beginning of this month, the Japanese Fujita Division launched a fierce attack towards Gaocheng and Tianhekou in Suixian, but after being met with a head-on blow by a certain unit of the Chinese army, it suffered heavy losses and failed to achieve its objective. The Japanese Ogisō Division, Fujie Division, and Kojima Cavalry Brigade, which advanced north from the Jingzhong Road, broke through the Chinese army's Changshoudian position east of the Xiang River and fled north. However, after being intercepted by the Chinese army midway, the Japanese army's rear communication line could not be maintained. Moreover, the advance of the Chinese army on the Hanyi Road and the occupation of Duoshi Bay, Yuekou, and Yu Xinh River made the Japanese troops in Tianmen and Jingshan feel a great threat. The Chinese army in Eastern Hubei launched a fierce attack on Guangshui and Wusheng Pass, destroying the Pinghan Road and attacking Yingshan, causing great pain to the Japanese rear. Their advancing troops were also severely attacked by the Chinese army near Tanghe and Xinye, and their morale was greatly diminished. Chinese officers and soldiers were exceptionally brave in various places, making it impossible for the Japanese troops to gain a foothold near the Dabie Mountains, forcing them to flee to Jingshan and Anlu. Even the Sui and Zao strongholds could not be held. The fatigue and disorder of the officers and soldiers during the retreat were indescribable. The Japanese army abandoned infantry guns, machine guns, grenade launchers, ammunition, horses, and baggage everywhere in the area south of Tanghe and north of Suixian. The severity of their losses can be generally seen. Judging from the battle's progress, the decline in the morale of the Japanese army can be generally proved. After this great victory, the entire battle situation in Hubei has been completely under Chinese control. Large armies are gathered, and the arrangements are tight, making the Japanese troops confined to the vicinity of Wuhan, unable to take a step beyond. (Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The Japanese 3rd, 13th, and 16th Divisions, etc., which aimed to eliminate the main force of the Chinese army with Xiangfan as the main attack point, have all collapsed. Among them, the 16th Division suffered the heaviest losses. According to a certain officer who returned from the front line to report to reporters, the Japanese army was forced to march more than two hundred li strongly due to the influence of the Chinese army's movements between the 14th, 15th, and 16th. When the Chinese army attacked the Japanese army in the Tanghe area, most of the Japanese troops and horses were exhausted and captured by the Chinese army. This time, the Japanese army originally planned to encircle the Chinese army in Northern Hubei, but unexpectedly, the Chinese troops east of the Pinghan Line suddenly crossed west of the road, and the troops in Western Henan advanced into Northern Hubei. At the same time, the Chinese troops on the Zhongxiang and Hanyi Roads launched attacks everywhere, creating a counter-encirclement advantage. When the Japanese army generally collapsed on the 18th, the self-defense forces of Zaoyang, Suixian, Yicheng, and other counties on the Chinese side immediately launched fierce attacks. The Japanese army abandoned all military blankets, military uniforms, and telephones everywhere. The supreme commander, Okamura, was severely reprimanded by the Japanese high command for the failure of commanding the battle. At the same time, the 16th Division of the Japanese army suffered the heaviest losses and has been transferred back to Hankou. Currently, there are only more than 2,000 Japanese troops in Zhongxiang. The Chinese and Japanese armies are still in mixed combat in the Dabie Mountains. The Japanese army has been annihilated to more than one regiment. The Chinese army's activities on the Hanyi and Jingzhong Roads are even stronger. The Japanese reinforcement troops are holding on firmly and dare not go out to meet the battle. The Chinese army has an absolute advantage. (Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>Changde: Huarong telephone report: The Xiangbei battle is about to reignite. Although the Japanese army has repeatedly suffered setbacks on the north bank of the Xinqiang River, it is still attempting to fight again. It has also transferred troops from Shanghai to Yueyang. Two ocean liners arrived at Yueyang Jiangxin, one carrying 17 tanks and 2 motorcycles, and the other carrying provisions. They are currently being unloaded. There are currently four Japanese submarines, seventy speedboats, and three small warships parked on the Yueyang river. On the morning of the 21st, two more warships arrived from downstream. From Chenglingji to the north gate of Yuecheng, the Japanese have newly set up five lines of naval mines, and four new heavy artillery pieces have been erected outside the north gate. (Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Changsha) The Japanese army in Xiangbei launched an all-out intrusion on the Chinese positions on the north bank of the Xinqiang River with all its strength yesterday and the day before yesterday. After the Chinese officers and soldiers counterattacked separately, the Japanese army suffered more than a thousand casualties. The front line has returned to calm today. (Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>Miluo: The Chinese army on the north bank of the Xinqiang River, taking advantage of the Japanese army's repeated defeats and the disappearance of its morale, also counterattacked the Japanese from both wings on the night of the 24th, achieving considerable gains. On the 25th, the front line turned into a state of truce during the day. There were only skirmishes, and there were no traces of Japanese warships on the lake surface of Lu Jiaoshi.

<h3>Japanese Troops in Southwestern Shanxi Take a Defensive Posture on All Transportation Lines; The Southern Section of the Tongpu Railway is Under Chinese Control; Japanese Attempts to Cross Fenglingdu Have Not Succeeded</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Shanxi Telegram: Japanese troops in Southwestern Shanxi are still taking a defensive posture on all transportation lines. The southern section of the Tongpu Railway and the vicinity of the Zhongtiao Mountains are all under Chinese control. The Japanese troops at Fenglingdu have increased their troops again and used artillery fire for cover, attempting to cross by force. The Chinese guards retaliate at any time. The Japanese troops have suffered heavy casualties, and the river defense is safe. (Special Telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Fuyang Suffer Setbacks in Their Attack</h3>
<p>Jinhua: Two or three hundred Japanese troops in Fuyang attempted to encircle the right wing of the Chinese army from north of Tuoling in the afternoon of the 22nd. After fighting until midnight, the Chinese army transferred to the line of Wangjiang Yangjiaoyan Yangfanglin Yi Jian Dui Er Shan. On the morning of the 23rd, the Japanese army continued to attack but was repulsed by the Chinese army. (Special Telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>Capable Personnel of the Japanese Air Force Die in Chongqing</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to reliable information, the land-based attack aircraft belonging to Colonel Okuda Kikushi of the Japanese Naval Air Force XX Squadron, as well as the XX teams of Majors Irisawa Toshihisa and Masuda Tanzo, repeatedly bombed Hengyang, Changsha, Zhijiang, Kunming, Yushan, Guixi, and other city areas, and also frantically bombed the Chongqing city area, affecting various friendly nations' embassies and consulates, causing international condemnation. Recently, according to Japanese announcements, (May 3rd) two Japanese aircraft destroyed by the Chinese side in Chongqing airspace were the leader aircraft of the first formation piloted by Major Irisawa and the leader aircraft of the second formation piloted by Major Masuda. The dead included Majors Irisawa and Masuda, as well as fourteen people including Second Lieutenants Ishitani and Kanegawa. It is reported that Irisawa and Masuda were both 36 years old this year and graduated from the Japanese Naval Aviation Academy. They both served as second lieutenant candidates in July of the 10th year of the Taisho era, were appointed second lieutenants in December of the 14th year of the Taisho era, appointed lieutenants in December of the 2nd year of the Showa era, and appointed captains in October of the 5th year. They were only promoted to major after the war. They were among the few long-distance aviators and mechanical geniuses in the Japanese Navy, and now they have all died in battle, which is a great loss for the Japanese side. (Telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>The American Ship Authorities Instructed to Set Up Anti-Aircraft Guns; If Japanese Aircraft Show a Tendency to Dive, Soldiers Must Open Fire</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) It was announced today that the authorities of the American ship "Tutila" instructed the sailors last night to set up anti-aircraft guns to prevent any eventuality, because the officers of the ship had seen Japanese aircraft flying over the Yangtze River, with their left and right wings and the mooring place on the south bank forming a parallel line. According to a person on the ship who told a United Press reporter, they witnessed a Japanese aircraft being shot down by a Chinese aircraft during a fierce battle with a Chinese aircraft. According to American naval officers, they issued an order that in the future, if Japanese aircraft show a tendency to bomb the "Tutila," the ship's soldiers may fire anti-aircraft guns. However, according to the ship's officers who recently told a United Press reporter, the ship will only open fire with anti-aircraft guns when Japanese aircraft intentionally "descend" to drop bombs on the ship. However, according to air force experts, it is actually impossible for Japanese aircraft to "descend" and bomb at present, because the Japanese heavy bombers fly from Hankou. If they make this kind of "descending flight," they cannot immediately recover. Due to the above reasons, the Naval Headquarters believes that it is not difficult to deal with aircraft bombing Chongqing in the future. It is also known that after bombing Chongqing last night, Japanese aircraft flew to the airfield near Chongqing to drop bombs, but as a result, none of the Chinese aircraft stationed there were damaged. The two major fires that occurred last night were extinguished at midnight. This Japanese aircraft bombing has actually helped the Chongqing authorities a lot, because the authorities are opening up firebreaks. They are "opening up" firebreaks that the authorities did not intend to build. Also, Kong Lingkan, the son of Kong Xiangxi, was left in the office in the city during the air raid and could not go out. Later, someone saw him driving a destroyed car home at ten o'clock. It is reported that he was not injured. Also, this Japanese aircraft air raid completely failed the government's attempt to investigate the population. (American United Press Telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>Putian County Town Suffers its First Air Raid</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) Three Japanese aircraft dropped three bombs on Putian County Town at 2:20 PM on the 25th, causing slight losses. The county is located 160 li south of Fuzhou and is now experiencing its first air raid. (25th)</p>

<h3>German Newspapers Report that Wang Jingwei is Negotiating with Japan; Chen Gongbo Expresses Extreme Opposition; Wang's Plan Has Been Hit</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to a report from the "Frankfurter Zeitung" correspondent in China, Wang Jingwei, the former Deputy President of the Chinese Kuomintang, has recently been active in organizing a "Chinese government" willing to negotiate peace with Japan. It is said that people close to Wang Jingwei admit that negotiations have been conducted with the Japanese side. In addition to sending representatives to Peiping to discuss with the "Provisional Government," Wang Jingwei himself has also made contact with the "Reformed Government" in Nanjing. However, Chen Gongbo, the most powerful politician, has expressed extreme opposition to Wang's plan. The correspondent believes that Chen's attitude has greatly hit Jingwei's plan. As for the content of the negotiations with Japan, the newspaper did not know anything. (Haitong News Agency Telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>After the Resolutions of the League of Nations Administrative Council in This Session</h3>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly described in detail the proposals and resolutions of the current regular meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council. For the two requests made by the Chinese representative Gu Weijun, two resolutions were made: (1) To suggest to each member state that they individually assist China within the possible scope; (2) To condemn Japanese aircraft bombing ordinary Chinese people, and to request each member state and non-member state to immediately notify the League of Nations Administrative Council if they learn of such bombing incidents in the future. However, the request to organize a China Aid Adjustment Committee was clearly rejected.</p>
<p>Japan's military invasion of China has been launched for almost eight years. In the beginning, the two pillars of the League of Nations, Britain and France, could not resolutely exert the principles of the League of Nations and use the League of Nations' mechanism to severely sanction the aggressor. Although the United States had a sacred obligation under the Nine-Power Treaty, it was helpless due to being isolated. As a result, Japan became even more unscrupulous, trampling on all international treaties, trampling on China's sovereignty, people, and land. Even the interests of Britain, France, and the United States in China have been greatly eroded and threatened. Recently, it has intensified and launched an anti-British movement, attempting to change the status quo of the historical concessions. Not satisfied with controlling the Chinese coast, it attempts to eradicate other countries' ships from navigating within China's seas. Therefore, we might as well imagine a phenomenon, that is, if China does not resist, can the interests of various countries in China still be retained? If China's resistance fails, can the interests of various countries in China still be retained? Japan's ambition is like this, its actions are like this, the relationship of whether China fights or not is like this, and the relationship of whether China wins or loses is like this, but the resolutions of the League of Nations are like that. We cannot bear to cry injustice!</p>
<p>The resolutions of the League of Nations Administrative Council are not only poor in content but also weak in effectiveness; not only weak but also invited factual ridicule. Not to mention the distant ones, let's review the various forms since the opening of the current regular meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council: 1. The Gulangyu issue has not been resolved, but the slight good atmosphere presented after the British, French, and American naval marines landed on the island was like a flash in the pan, disappearing in an instant. Recently, Japan has become strong again, and the situation has become serious again. 2. The British mail ship "Lampu La" was forced to stop by Japanese warships and boarded for inspection outside Hong Kong, which Britain considers a very important stronghold. 3. The French mail ship "Alamis" was also inspected near Hong Kong. 4. Anti-British propaganda within Japan has revived. 5. The saying that Japan has joined the German-Italian political and military alliance treaty is widely spread in Tokyo and Berlin. 6. The attempt to change the concessions has gone a step further, turning into the so-called "recovery of concessions." 7. Directly in response to the resolutions of the League of Nations Administrative Council, in order to provide reports to member states and non-member states of the League of Nations, it bombed the Chongqing city area again and killed unarmed citizens on a large scale. 8. Although the world knows Japan's intention and limit of invasion of China, Japan has always been evasive and hesitant. Towards the Far East, it advocates the so-called new order; towards the occupied areas, it establishes the so-called new regime; towards Wang Jingwei, it talks about ending the war and negotiating peace. Until yesterday, the spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs frankly stated at a press conference in Tokyo: Japan "is betting the fate of the country as a sole wager, and the purpose of its actions in China is to place China's sovereignty under Japanese control." Needless to say, this is kicking Wang Jingwei and his like away and also signing an autograph of an aggressor under the resolution of the League of Nations recognizing China as an invaded country.</p>
<p>These facts, even if they do not have to be fully attributed to the direct causal relationship with the attitude of the League of Nations, are at least clearly performed at the same time that the current regular meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council was held. Faced with this kind of performance, only China has no hesitation and no shame in continuing its resistance as an answer. This has troubled the League of Nations led by Britain and France, and the administrative council's regular meeting chaired by the Soviet representative. Let's see how they will continue afterwards.</p>
<h3>Japan Attempts to Block Chinese Coast; Britain and the United States are Paying Close Attention; Exchanging Views and Taking Unified Action; Considering Whether to Take Retaliatory Measures; British Parliamentarians Have Seriously Questioned</h3>
<p>(London) According to the "Daily Herald", Japan's infringing behavior in recent days has caused "major concern" to countries related to the Far East. It is reported that the British naval authorities are considering plans to provide naval escorts to British ships sailing in Chinese waters. Regarding the Alamis case, the French authorities are expected to file a strong protest, and its policy is similar to the protest filed by Britain regarding the Japanese sailors boarding the Lampu La in the waters adjacent to Hong Kong. (Reuters Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) According to a Japanese spokesperson in Shanghai yesterday, foreign ships within 200 miles of the Chinese coast must be detained by the Japanese Navy for inspection of registration licenses and documents. As for the list of contraband, it is still under consideration. Because the nature is complicated, it is difficult to publish it temporarily. The Japanese spokesperson said, "This point is not a matter of right, but a request from the Japanese people." These words have attracted the attention of people here. The government here regards this de facto declaration of Japan's entire blockade of China as serious, so it may take economic retaliatory measures against Japan or cooperate with the United States to deal with it. A government spokesperson said, "Although Japan has not legally declared a state of war, it has arbitrarily enjoyed the rights of a belligerent country." However, the intention of the Japanese side to expand its blockade action has not yet been officially notified to countries with interests in China, so it seems that the British government's adoption of practical retaliatory measures still has to wait. However, the work of exchanging views with the United States is expected to be carried out soon. Regarding the method of protecting merchant ships off the Chinese coast with warships, it is considered inappropriate here, because Britain does not have many warships in the Far East. Therefore, experts believe that what Britain can do is to take retaliatory measures against Japan in concert with the United States. (American United Press Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the government maintains an indifferent attitude towards reports that Japan has de facto blockaded China, but it is believed that they have actually been paying close attention to the reports of the blockade of the Chinese coast and the recent searches of British and French mail ships by the Japanese Navy. According to well-informed sources, government officials are paying close attention to this incident because they believe that the interests of the United States in China are almost equal to those of Britain and France. It is believed that officials from various departments, including Secretary of State Hull, are paying close attention to this report, but they all remain silent and make no formal comments. They said that they have not yet received formal documents from Japan or related third countries regarding statements about this incident. According to the impression obtained by reporters, they believe that as of now, the Japanese blockade has not yet affected the United States, so there is no need to make any comments. Also, Japan's previous threats to blockade China have aroused close attention in official circles, so the current situation is no exception. It is reported that officials and the shipping industry are paying close attention to the actions of the President Coolidge, because the ship is currently in the Hong Kong area, sailing from Hong Kong to Manila. They speculate that the ship may also encounter the same fate as the British ship "Lampu La" and the French ship "Alamis." Some foreign policy experts believe that the United States is currently waiting for the same case to occur before issuing a formal declaration. The heads of the US government stated that the Japanese Navy's blockade of China violates international law and that Japan cannot enjoy this right unless it declares war on China and assumes all responsibilities. (American United Press Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The plan adopted by the British government to protect British ships on Chinese waters to prevent Japanese interference cannot be ascertained in its essence. However, Reuters has learned that the British government's decision to take this plan is undoubtedly certain. However, matters such as dispatching warships to escort and placing guards on British ships are difficult to implement because the area of Chinese waters is very wide, the number of British ships is very large, and the British Navy does not have that many remaining ships or soldiers to protect merchant ships. Reuters also heard that the British government is now earnestly reviewing the overall situation in China. According to well-informed observers, this Japanese military officer's boarding of the British company's mail ship "Lampu La" for inspection must be due to the frustration encountered in the Gulangyu case, and the heart cannot be calmed, so he vented his anger and came out with this. And because some or most of them realized that the war against China was becoming increasingly unfavorable to the Japanese side, and the end of the period was even more hopeless than before, so they acted recklessly. It is expected that this awareness will become increasingly profound, and it is feared that the Japanese military's interference actions will become increasingly deteriorated as a result. A Reuters reporter interviewed a certain authority on international law today. According to him, according to international law, if one country takes actions that damage the interests of another country, the damaged country may implement retaliation, as long as its retaliatory actions are of the same nature as the damaging actions and use the same methods. Regarding this point, Reuters has learned that the British government is now carefully considering using consular certification to counter Japanese interference in trade and currency issues in North China, that is, all goods transported from North China to Britain will henceforth be required to be filled out by the British consul with a certificate proving that these goods were purchased and paid for in a free and open market and were not obtained by improper means and small paths. As for the Shanghai incident, Reuters has learned that the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, and the American Ambassador, Grew, have recently notified the Japanese government to make it clear that the United Kingdom and the United States have a strong attitude towards Japan's relying on strength to interfere with the administration of the public concessions and have no doubts about it. (Reuters Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Labour MP Henderson and Conservative MPs Fox and Chay successively asked the government about the British ship "Lampu La" being intercepted by a Japanese warship. Deputy Secretary of State Butler replied that the British government is currently considering measures to protect British ships at sea in China to avoid being interfered with. The Deputy Secretary also described the situation of the ship being intercepted by the Japanese warship, and also mentioned the British fleet commander Noble in China and the ambassador to Japan protesting to the Japanese side. Henderson asked if it was reported that Japan wanted to blockade the Chinese coast. If this statement is true, is it not in conflict with international law? Could the government set up an escort in the Chinese sea when the Japanese side blocked the coast in order to protect British ships from illegal interference? Butler replied that the government is currently giving urgent consideration to the issue of protecting British voyages due to this rumor. This blockade is indeed in conflict with international law. Conservative MP Milner said that he did not want to make it more difficult for the government to handle the Far East incident, but what does the Deputy Secretary's statement that foreign warships intercepting British ships is a customary nature mean? He would like to hear the details. He has never heard that foreign countries intercepting British ships can be said to be a custom. Deputy Secretary Butler replied, "What I said was that there was no action to inspect the ship's manifest or cargo when boarding the ship. In fact, the British government has already criticized foreigners for boarding British ships." Labour MP Fletcher asked the British government if it intended to take retaliatory actions or just protect British ships. Butler replied, "I cannot continue to state anything today, but I can tell Fletcher that the government attaches importance to this matter." Conservative MP Fox asked the Admiralty if it was satisfied that the British fleet in the Far East was strong enough to protect Britain's legal shipping industry against any form of aggression, or if it intended to increase the strength of the Far East fleet. Shakespeare, the Parliamentary Secretary attending the Parliament of the Admiralty, replied that the government is closely watching the matter of providing full naval protection to British ships in the Far East. However, for the sake of public interest, it is not convenient to announce the distribution of the fleet. (Reuters Telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>Kulangsu Incident Turns to Diplomatic Channels; Naval Authorities of Three Countries Fail to Reach a Decision After Three Meetings; Japanese Consul General to Negotiate with the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>(Amoy) Mr. Moss, Chairman of the Kulangsu International Settlement Municipal Council, requested leave of absence during the Municipal Council meeting on Wednesday and is traveling to Hong Kong. Mr. Stirk, Manager of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's Amoy branch, has been elected as Acting Chairman. According to Japanese sources, Mr. Moss, who serves as Consul for Hungary and the Netherlands in Amoy, has taken leave to avoid disputes arising from the Kulangsu incident. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Amoy news reported in Japanese newspapers, the Kulangsu Municipal Council is quite alarmed after Japanese naval authorities prohibited Chinese civilian ships from traveling between Kulangsu and the mainland. The Acting Chairman of the Municipal Council, Mr. Stirk, visited Japanese Consul Uchida on Thursday to plead for the revocation of this prohibition, lest it hinder the supply of daily necessities to the residents of Kulangsu. It is reported that Uchida stated to Stirk that the Japanese side prohibited civilian ships from traveling in order to prevent anti-Japanese elements in Amoy from infiltrating Kulangsu. When the authorities considered ways to improve the situation that day, Kulangsu could rely on Amoy for the supply of daily necessities. At the same time, the proposal made by the diplomatic corps to establish a special area in Kulangsu, patrolled by Japanese police to allow food to be transported from Amoy, was reportedly rejected by the Japanese naval authorities, who believed that this expedient measure could not prevent the infiltration of anti-Japanese elements. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Amoy news reported in Japanese newspapers, naval authorities from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan held their third decision-making meeting yesterday on the British cruiser HMS Birmingham. Although no decision was reached, the commanders of the three countries' fleets all expressed a common desire to withdraw their sailors from Kulangsu. Yesterday's meeting was the final meeting of the UK, US, and Japanese fleet commanders. The Kulangsu incident will now be negotiated by diplomats. At the same time, Japanese authorities stated that the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet in South China, among others, met for three hours yesterday and reportedly decided that Japanese Consul General Uchida would negotiate with the Municipal Council authorities in order to reorganize the Kulangsu Municipal Council.

<p>(Tokyo) The British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Clive, lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Foreign Ministry today regarding the Japanese naval authorities' interception of the well-known Ambassador Line's SS Larpura in international waters along the Chinese coast, and protested against the continued detention of the British ships SS Sagres and SS Lolita. A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry told a Reuters reporter today that the Japanese warship's interception of the SS Larpura was a routine incident to ascertain its nationality.

<h3>Japan's Relations with Germany and Italy to Trigger Major Political Upheaval; Japanese Ambassadors to Germany and Italy to Resign in Anger; Germany and Italy Still Attempting to Undermine UK, France, and Soviet Union Alliance</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to authoritative sources today, the Japanese Ambassadors to Germany and Italy may resign because the government has refused to participate in a military agreement with Germany and Italy. It is said that the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Oshima, and the Ambassador to Italy, Toshio Shiratori, are very angry about the government's decision to maintain neutrality in the European dispute. It is said that they have declared that they would rather resign than convey the government's decision to the governments of Germany and Italy. The government's decision is completely contrary to the views of the two ambassadors, who have always advocated that Japan should join the military agreement of the dictatorial countries. Prime Minister Hiranuma and Foreign Minister Arita are now working hard to try to change this view, but if this effort fails, they will have no choice but to approve their resignations. The resignation of the Japanese Ambassadors to Germany and Italy may also prompt Foreign Minister Arita to resign from the cabinet, as this fact encompasses Japan's entire foreign policy issue. If Foreign Minister Arita's resignation becomes a reality, the post of Foreign Minister may be succeeded by Japan's Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, who will soon return to Tokyo from Moscow. Since the Japanese Army Ministry strongly supports the conclusion of a military agreement with Germany and Italy, it is generally speculated here that the military may take retaliatory action against those who oppose the proposal. It is understood that the government is well aware that rejecting a military agreement with Germany and Italy may cause dissatisfaction in some quarters and the possibility of anti-government conspiracies, but it is not expected that any serious disputes will occur. (Associated Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) It is generally believed here that the Axis powers will respond to the negotiations between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union by announcing a military alliance with Japan or Spain, especially Japan. The wording of Japan's congratulatory telegram to the German-Italian alliance and the recent series of meetings held in Tokyo to strengthen anti-communism have attracted attention here. It is reported that the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Oshima, recently met with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop several times regarding this matter and said that the difficulties Japan feels regarding the military alliance are not insurmountable. Some Japanese officials here believe that in the event of a European war, Japan will in any case find it difficult to maintain neutrality. According to the German government's instructions for distributing texts to foreign newspapers regarding the efforts of the United Kingdom and France to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union, it was stated that "the dictatorial countries will respond appropriately to this new encirclement attempt." The text also recognized that these efforts by the United Kingdom and France are making the situation more serious. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) News from Berlin states that the scope of the German-Italian alliance treaty may be expanded to include Japan. Persons close to the government here recently commented, stating briefly that if this news is true, then the scope of the mutual assistance agreement between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union should also be expanded and implemented in the Far East. Up to now, the United Kingdom has never made this proposal, and the Soviet Union has also avoided involving this level in order to increase the difficulty of negotiations between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. Although, judging from Japan's past attitude, this news from Berlin may not be reliable, if Japan suddenly changes its mind and fully cooperates with the German-Italian Axis, then the reaction from the United Kingdom will arrive very quickly. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) A semi-official announcement was recently issued, stating briefly that the United Kingdom is currently trying to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union, which shows that although Germany and Italy are willing to resolve various European issues in a friendly manner, they have been rejected by the United Kingdom and France. The day before yesterday, the Italian government spokesperson Gayda published an article in "Il Giornale d'Italia," also stating that Europe is currently at a crossroads, hoping that the United Kingdom and France will amend the Treaty of Versailles peacefully and not engage in encirclement again. In short, Germany and Italy invited the United Kingdom and France to come out and cooperate for the last time. Germany and Italy repeatedly said so, but the United Kingdom and France still adopted so-called practical and effective new methods, and only continued to implement the encirclement policy. The situation is clear and cannot be denied. It further proves that the United Kingdom and France are unwilling to work together to find constructive solutions to maintain European peace, and that they have no sincerity in resolving the peace issue. The situation is therefore becoming more and more tense. The dictatorial countries will naturally have to respond to this new encirclement attempt. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>UK, France, and Soviet Union Mutual Assistance Draft Submitted to Soviet Government; UK Statement Claims No Encirclement of Germany; Still Prepared to Negotiate at Any Time</h3>
<p>(Moscow) British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Seeds visited Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin yesterday and left after only a few minutes. He presented the British government's counterproposal for concluding a tripartite military agreement with the Soviet Union. (Associated Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the draft of the mutual assistance agreement between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, the governments of the United Kingdom and France have reached full agreement. This afternoon, French Foreign Minister Bonnet submitted the draft to Soviet Ambassador Suritz for transmission to Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Although officials here have remained silent regarding the nature and scope of the British proposal to the Soviet Union, according to news obtained by Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, its content will include the following points: (1) Conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement to be implemented if any of the three countries' European territories are invaded. Before concluding a formal treaty, a tripartite declaration will be issued to address this threat. (2) Provision stating that if any country guaranteed by the three countries is directly invaded, the three countries should consult and take action. However, it has not yet been decided which countries will be included in this guarantee. Also, any country that encounters invasion must resist before this guarantee is implemented. (3) The general staffs of the three countries should consult with each other to ensure the most efficient cooperation of the three countries' naval, land, and air forces. Reuters' diplomatic correspondent also stated that there are sufficient reasons to believe that any treaty will be concluded based on the above principles. Although the above articles have failed to satisfy the Soviet Union's original proposal for a complete defensive alliance, they actually include the direct threats faced by the three countries and will not harm any country pursuing a policy of peaceful cooperation. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) After the German semi-official announcement was issued, officials here also made a statement, stating that "The German announcement contained the phrase 'The Axis countries invited the democratic countries to jointly solve various European problems, this is the last time.' British officials, after reading it, were at a loss to understand. The obligations that the British government has accepted and will accept must be implemented only when the sovereign country related to the obligations is threatened with invasion. It is not appropriate to call this encirclement. On the contrary, the US government has always advocated that all outstanding cases should be resolved through negotiations and is still willing to cooperate to achieve this goal."

<h3>UK Invites Voroshilov to Visit UK to Observe Autumn Exercises; UK and France Also to Send Military Delegations to Moscow</h3>
<p>(London) The British government has recently invited Soviet People's Commissar for Defense Marshal Voroshilov to come to the United Kingdom in September this year to observe large-scale army maneuvers. The military leaders of all countries that have a mutual assistance agreement with the United Kingdom are also among those invited. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) It is rumored that the British Minister of War Hore-Belisha will soon visit the Soviet Union, although this has been denied by officials. However, it is possible that Soviet People's Commissar for Defense Marshal Voroshilov will invite Hore-Belisha to visit the Soviet Union to inspect the progress of the Soviet army when he comes to the UK to observe army exercises in September this year. Whether Hore-Belisha can make the trip will depend on the state of the European diplomatic situation at that time. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is reported that the French government will follow the United Kingdom in sending a military delegation to Moscow to exchange military details with the Soviet government in order to lay the foundation for the conclusion of a Franco-Soviet military alliance.

<h3>Mussolini Suffers Two Assassination Attempts; Assassins Executed</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Paris Evening News recently reported that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini suffered two assassination attempts on April 27th and early May, but fortunately he was not hit. The assassins have all been executed. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Strength Greatly Increased; Standing Army of Two Million; Morale Not Affected by Purges; Between Six and Seven Thousand Aircraft</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Foreign observers here recently declared that the strength of the Soviet army, navy, and air force has been greatly increased. First, in terms of the army, the peacetime establishment is at least two million personnel. Each infantry division previously had only 13,000 officers and soldiers, but this has now been increased to 18,100. There are currently 51,000 active-duty officers, and about 5,000 young officers graduate from various military academies each year. Although it is rumored that army morale has been greatly affected by the purge movement, this claim is incredible. This can be seen from the lack of division between the public and the military. In addition, the government recently changed regulations and removed the Communist Party's army branch's authority to interrogate officers, transferring it to higher-ranking officers in order to increase the authority of officers and prevent them from being controlled by the Party branch. Red Army tactics have also been revised to emphasize offensive warfare. At the same time, most of the army's units have been mechanized, including artillery units. However, in view of the inconvenience of transportation in winter and the possible difficulties in fuel supply, which affect the movement of mechanized units, a large number of cavalry are still maintained. As for armored vehicles and light tanks, there are many, but heavy tanks are gradually decreasing. As for the air force, the Soviet Union currently has between 6,000 and 7,000 aircraft, most of which are made according to the best models of various countries. Several new types of aircraft participated in the May Day parade in Moscow this year, but the outside world does not know what their structure is. However, there are shortcomings in the training of pilots. Generally, pilots absolutely obey orders, and they are slightly rigid, but their courage and daring have long been famous. This can be evidenced by the outstanding achievements of Kochinaki and Chkalov, who either flew from the Soviet Union to the United States or flew over the Arctic. Furthermore, in terms of naval strength, it has also been completely renovated in the past two years, and several new-type warships have been built by Italian shipyards. The Soviet Navy currently possesses seven new-type cruisers, several destroyers and submarines, and plans to start building battleships on its own. Deputy People's Commissar for the Navy, Vice Admiral Isakov, was recently ordered to go to the United States to find ways to purchase the materials necessary for shipbuilding. The strength of the Soviet army, navy, and air force is generally like this. As for the distribution of forces, it seems to focus on the Far East region. According to the estimates of military experts here, Japan has a total of 400,000 troops stationed in Manchuria and North China, while the Soviet Union seeks to match it. In addition, the Soviet authorities are actively engaged in construction in the Far East, such as opening up seaports, developing agricultural production, and establishing metallurgical plants, shipyards, and canned food factories, which have all achieved remarkable results. As a result, the Far East region has reached a state of self-sufficiency. In order to facilitate transportation, a railway is being laid between Lake Baikal and the Heilongjiang River to complement the Siberian Railway, and another railway will be built south of the Siberian Railway this year. All of these measures are intended to make transportation between the Far East region and other parts of the Soviet Union more convenient. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Poland and Romania Express Approval</h3>
<p>Warsaw: After the newly appointed Soviet Ambassador to Poland, Sharano, took office, Foreign Minister Beck received him yesterday for their first conversation. It is understood that the conversation involved the UK-Soviet negotiations and Poland's attitude. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) According to the Daily Express, regarding the British government's inquiry to the Polish government as to what attitude Poland would take if the Soviet Union provided military assistance to Poland, the Warsaw correspondent of that newspaper has learned that the Warsaw government has instructed its ambassador to the United Kingdom to submit a reply, stating that Poland recognizes the UK-Soviet convention in this plan, but only on the condition that the Soviet army's stay in Polish territory does not exceed what is required strategically in the event of war. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania: The negotiations between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union on a mutual assistance agreement are receiving great attention from officials here. Officials stated that they were unable to establish any relationship with various groups until they were definitely established and effective. Political figures also stated that in the event of a European war, various consultation agreements would automatically declare their establishment. As for the alliance treaty signed between Romania and Poland, it can be implemented as soon as a signatory country is attacked by any country. However, the general interpretation is that only a crisis from the East can apply this alliance to cope with it. In fact, if the two countries Poland and Romania believe that Germany constitutes a crisis, this alliance can also be applied, provided that the general staffs of the two countries hold talks to agree on measures to deal with all contingencies. Furthermore, in terms of the mutual relationship between Romania and the Soviet Union, Romania is prepared to accept the guarantees that the Soviet Union can provide, but it must be stated that the Romanian government has not requested this guarantee. In short, Romania is happy to accept whatever country is willing to guarantee Romania's current borders. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>European Situation Becomes Clear</h3>
<p>(London) An authority in the London securities industry told a Reuters reporter today that the climate seems to be gradually becoming clearer, and as far as the securities market is concerned, a turnaround is hoped for. Demand from buyers was quite strong on the stock exchange today, especially for British government bonds and other first-class bonds. Commentators generally believe that the international situation is now less tense than before, hence this improvement, and that a UK-Soviet agreement is expected to be concluded soon, so people's hearts are more stable. The South African £5 million defense loan, actually received at 96.5, with an annual interest rate of 3.5% and set to be repaid from 1954 to 1959, was just issued today and was quickly oversubscribed. The commodities exchange also showed improvement, especially rubber, due to increased purchases by the industry and better market news from the United States. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain is Energetic Despite His Age; Still Striving to Avert War Crisis</h3>
<p>Edinburgh: The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland was held here today, and Prime Minister Chamberlain attended and delivered a speech outlining the international situation, stating, "Although I have suffered repeated setbacks, I continue to work day and night, hoping to maintain peace in Europe, avert the war crisis, and eliminate the feeling of insecurity for the people of all countries. Furthermore, in view of the importance of the responsibilities I bear, I must also strengthen our military defenses to ensure the safety of our nation. We also deeply know that the current disputes cannot be resolved by force, and we hope that the Christian churches can mobilize their spiritual power to urge all peoples and their rulers to strive to establish good neighborly relations. I cannot express this hope enough." (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>The Han River Area: The Chinese Defense Line is Stable – A Reuters Correspondent's On-the-Spot Inspection – Strong and Robust Soldiers Fight Bravely, Discipline and Equipment are Excellent, There is Absolutely No Sign of Demoralization Among the Military and Civilians, Deliberately Depleting Japanese Military Strength</h3>
<p>A Certain Place in Central China The reporter, after inspecting the Chinese defense line along the Han River opposite Zhongxiang, 120 miles northwest of Hankou, felt that all circumstances seemed favorable to the Chinese army. The reporter traveled by truck to Jinmen Town on the Xiangyi Highway, and from there rode on horseback for 30 miles to reach the Han River. The villages between Jinmen and the Han River are mountainous, interspersed with many watery rice paddies, so the terrain seems quite conducive to defense. After the complete destruction of the Zhongxiang-Jinmen Highway, the various natural difficulties in the mountainous areas have become even more important. I witnessed the destruction of the final stage of the highway, with large numbers of farmers digging tank traps in higher areas, while on road surfaces passing through rice paddies, water buffalo were used to plow the road base into the water, turning it into a wet field. It is said that the farmers participate in this road destruction work entirely voluntarily, because the villages along the road have been subjected to fierce bombing by Japanese aircraft, so there is no need to persuade them; they are all happy to participate actively. After I arrived at the army headquarters, the commander and his subordinates treated me cordially. The soldiers here are all strong northerners, who like to eat raw onions and drink strong liquor, and are extremely brave in resisting the Japanese army. The next day, I went to the front line to observe, and the situation was quite calm at that time, because after the Japanese army repeatedly attempted to cross the river at that location and failed, they moved their main force north yesterday. Guided by an officer, I inspected the trenches along the Han River, which were very solid and all had air-raid shelters, quite similar to those seen in Suixian. At that time, only a few sentries were stationed in the trenches, while the main force was resting in the rear. The place where we stood at that time was directly opposite Zhongxiang County, and we could clearly see its city walls. The river surface there is more than one and a half miles wide, and the river water is very shallow and not turbulent. Because of the width of the river, coupled with the machine-gun fire on the shore, the Japanese army has repeatedly attempted to cross the river but has failed. Those stationed in this area are all North China troops, who are very strong and praised by the local residents for their bravery in battle. Their discipline and equipment are excellent, but they feel a lack of heavy artillery. Their morale is also very high. The military and civilians in various parts of northern Hubei have never seen any signs of demoralization. Although there may be some expressions of hardship and resentment, there is no one who urgently wants to seek peace immediately. The Chinese army commanders highly commend the current strategy of holding the well-defended positions and harassing the rear of the Japanese army with guerrillas. On that day, the Chinese army ordered a certain regiment to cross the Han River south of Zhongxiang and move north to attack the Japanese army, and then establish contact with the Chinese army closest to the Dabie Mountains area. An officer told me that this move is feasible, and it is clear that the Japanese claim of having surrounded 100,000 Chinese troops in this area is unreliable. On the way back, the reporter saw a fake artillery position set up by the Chinese army, surrounded by craters formed by Japanese bombing. This clever trick has always been popular with the Chinese army, and they are always happy to see the Japanese army wasting bombs. The health of the soldiers has now become a matter of great concern to the troops in various parts of Hubei Province. There are not many mosquitoes, but malaria is quite common, and other skin diseases are also quite rampant. Because the weather is gradually getting hotter, cholera and dysentery are likely to occur one after another. The lack of quinine makes malaria even more difficult to control. This year, China's agricultural harvest is expected to be as abundant as last year, which is of great importance to the long-term war of resistance, because only when the army and the people have enough food and clothing can they be loyal to the country. Judging from the current strategy used by the Chinese army, it is expected that the Sino-Japanese war will continue for several years. The Chinese army is determined to use this to deplete the enemy's military strength. To achieve this goal, an adequate supply of food is an important factor. This strategy of the Chinese army has now been effective in making the Japanese army tired. Chinese army officers believe that this strategy will not change until the Japanese army sends reinforcements. (Dispatch from Reuters Special Correspondent, May 28)</p>
<h3>Chongqing City: The Tragic Scene After the Bombing, Corpses Littered Everywhere, Bomb Craters Upon Bomb Craters</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Last night, Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing, apparently targeting the banking district. Twenty-seven Japanese aircraft, divided into three groups, flew in from the west, with Shaanxi Road as their destination. One group dropped bombs along the route from Xinfeng (transliteration) Street, east through Xianmiao Street, to Shaanxi Road. One group began bombing in Central Park, then went east through Taomenkou (transliteration) and fled to Shaanxi Road. Another group flew to Duyujie (transliteration), crossed Xiaoliangshi (transliteration), and flew towards Shaanxi Road. One bomb struck the high tower of the Meifeng Bank, causing the steel-and-concrete building to be pierced through two shields. All the glass windows of the building were completely shattered. The Meifeng Bank building is probably the most magnificent and tallest building in Chongqing. This morning, a Reuters reporter toured the city and saw that the bank's office in Xiachuan was still open for business. At 7:00 in the morning, all the staff were working in the office, but broken glass and other debris were scattered all over the floor. The fires in various parts of the city have all been extinguished. All the injured were taken to the hospital in the middle of the night. This morning, soldiers cleared the streets and carried away unexploded bombs, while workers repaired power and telegraph lines, very busy. The Reuters reporter went to Central Park immediately after the lifting of the curfew. As soon as he arrived, a tragic scene immediately came into view. Yesterday the weather was hot and there were many visitors, and the park was open and had no military targets, so many people took refuge in the park after the alarm sounded, thinking that the Japanese planes would not drop bombs here. But they were wrong. Japanese planes randomly dropped small bombs all over the park, falling like rain, causing many casualties. When the Reuters reporter arrived at the park, he saw about 30 injured people placed on stretchers, ready to be sent to the hospital. There were at least 20 corpses on the ground that had not been moved. A girl leaned against the wall, looking as if she were asleep. But when she was looked at closely, red blood flowed down her neck; she had been bombed to death. A woman held the hand of a dead boy about six years old, weeping sadly. The reporter walked a few more steps and saw another woman lying on the ground, not yet dead but unconscious. Next to her was a girl wearing a brightly colored printed cheongsam, and when touched, she was already stiff. Then he saw a soldier under a broken tree, his head almost blown off. Not far away, there was a well, and next to it were two female corpses. The children's playground, which was previously full of joy, is now littered with corpses, broken trees, and bomb craters everywhere. Two large bombs fell near the Chamber of Commerce, forming two large holes. The explosive force was so strong that stones flew high. When the Reuters reporter passed by, he still saw the stones red hot, as if they had just come out of a volcano. It can be seen that the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes also included incendiary bombs. Several bombs also fell on Duyujie, which had already been ruined by the bombing on May 4, so this time the bombs fell in piles of bricks and tiles, merely scattering bricks and stones everywhere. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) It is now learned that a squadron of Chinese fighter planes engaged in an aerial battle with Japanese planes over the western part of Chongqing last night. Later, another squadron of Japanese bombers attempted to bomb the Chinese airfields, but because the sky was dark, the bombs they dropped were far from the target. According to the Chinese Air Force, the result of the battle over Chongqing was that seven Japanese bombers were shot down. It is reported that the wreckage of four of them has now been found. All the Chinese planes returned safely to their original defense. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>News of Conflicts Between Mongolia and "Manchukuo" Arouses Great Attention in America</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, diplomatic observers here are paying close attention to reports of conflicts on the border between Outer Mongolia and "Manchukuo." They speculate whether this dispute will prompt the Soviet Union to react to recent events in Europe, including the Anglo-Soviet agreement and other peace groups. They also point out that the border conflict between Outer Mongolia and "Manchukuo" occurred precisely when Britain and the Soviet Union were about to conclude an agreement, and when Japan, due to the tough stance taken by Britain and the United States, withdrew its sailors who had landed on Gulangyu Island. This is worthy of attention. Some diplomatic observers believe that if the possibility of war in Europe continues to decrease, Japan will face difficult diplomatic and economic situations. Furthermore, if real peace can be established in Europe, the Soviet Union and other Western powers will exert greater pressure on events in the Far East. (Associated Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Japanese ambassador to Russia, Togo Shigenori, yesterday received instructions from his government to lodge a protest with Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov regarding the repeated attacks by Mongolian troops on the Mongolian-Manchurian border. The Japanese government demands that the Outer Mongolian authorities be warned against the recurrence of similar incidents. According to information obtained here, both sides used tanks and airplanes in the recent conflict between the Manchurian and Mongolian armies. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>British Members of Parliament Concerned About the Yunnan-Burma Railway</h3>
<p>(London) Sir Wilson, a Conservative Member of Parliament, asked Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons today whether he knew that the necessary roadbed work for the Yunnan-Burma Railway, a few miles outside Kunming, has now been completed, and asked when the Prime Minister could announce where the road is planned to be built and when the Chinese government intends to open the road to traffic. The Prime Minister replied in writing that Foreign Secretary Halifax had received information that the roadbed work for the aforementioned section of the railway was in progress and that he had not yet received any communication from the Chinese government regarding this matter.

<h3>The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Passes This Year's Budget, The Minister of Finance Submits a Report, The Committee on Industrial Construction is Added</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Third Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union opened today in the Kremlin here. The Council of the Union first held a meeting at 2:15 p.m., chaired by Speaker Andreev.

Member Baguirov proposed to accept the above agenda, and everyone unanimously agreed. Member Yaremasov proposed that the joint meeting of the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet listen to the report on the first case, the national budget, and discuss it separately in the individual meetings of the two chambers. After unanimous approval, it was decided to convene a joint meeting of the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities at 7:00 p.m. on the 25th. After the agenda was passed, the Speaker announced the adjournment of the first meeting of the Council of the Union. Many people attended the meeting as guests, including Stakhanov and shock workers, representatives of intellectuals, commanders of the Red Army, Navy and Air Force, representatives of the diplomatic corps, and domestic and foreign journalists.

<p>People's Finance Commissar Zverev submitted a report on the 1939 Soviet National Budget, which will be debated today. The 1939 Soviet National Budget, which People's Finance Commissar Zverev requested for approval, has been approved by the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union. Its revenue part is 155,607,000,000 rubles, and the expenditure part is 154,957,000,000 rubles. Expenditures include national economic expenditures of 59,310,000,000 rubles, social and cultural undertakings expenditures of 38,564,000,000 rubles, and expenditures of the People's Defense Committee and the Naval Committee of 40,885,000,000 rubles. Revenue exceeds expenditure by 650,000,000 rubles. His report is as follows: Zverev first stated that the 1939 budget is a powerful lever for the further development of all sectors of the national economy and culture, and for the further consolidation of the defense capabilities of the socialist country. He then stated that the completion of the two five-year plans has infinitely increased the accumulation of wealth of socialism. The Soviet Union's currency and the entire financial system are extremely solid. During the period of the Second Five-Year Plan, the total amount of the Soviet national budget (including the federal republics and local budgets) was 362,100 million rubles in revenue and 348,800 million rubles in expenditure. A very large part of the income was derived from the accumulation of wealth from the socialist economy. During the same period, investments in the national economy under the expenditure item were 183,700 million rubles, an increase of 3.4 times compared to the entire period of the First Five-Year Plan. Expenditures for social and cultural development were 73,000 million rubles, an increase of 5.7 times compared to the entire period of the First Five-Year Plan. If the funds allocated from the social insurance budget and other resources are included, the total amount of cultural undertakings expenditures will exceed 110,000 million rubles, of which education expenditures account for 65,900 million rubles, health 28,900 million rubles, and social insurance 16,100 million rubles. The economic and cultural backwardness of the various ethnic republics and provinces has been rapidly eliminated. For example, the Soviet Union's national budget increased by 164.1 percent from 1933 to 1937, while the budget of the Kazakh Republic increased by 405.167.7 percent during the same period. He also mentioned that the Soviet Union's financial strength has been greatly enhanced, and it possesses vast domestic resources sufficient for investment in the even larger economic, social, cultural, and defense construction programs in the Third Five-Year Plan. Therefore, the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has stipulated that national income should increase by 1.8 times during the Third Five-Year Plan. Zverev continued that in the 1937 Soviet National Accounts, the revenue portion was 96,600 million rubles and the expenditure was 93,900 million rubles. According to preliminary statistics, the 1938 national budget was 137,600 million rubles in revenue and 124,000 million rubles in expenditure, an increase of 32.1 percent over 1937. The 1939 national budget has revenue of 155,607 million rubles, an increase of 28,007 million rubles or 22 percent over 1938. The main source of this revenue is business income tax, which totals 92,438 million rubles, followed by state enterprise profit donations, which are 17,673 million rubles (10,598 million rubles in 1938). Zverev pointed out that the vast majority of the Soviet budget revenue comes from the socialist economy, and the taxes paid by the people are very small. In the 1939 budget, the latter is only 6,500 million rubles, accounting for 4.2 percent of the total. Also in this year's budget revenue, 5,850 million rubles come from government bonds. He cited examples to prove the great success of Soviet government bonds. It is said that the actual proceeds of the bonds in the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan were 5,887,400,000 rubles, exceeding the planned amount by 887,400,000 rubles. The deposits of the working masses in various savings banks have increased year by year, and as of January 1 of this year, their total amount has exceeded 6,000 million rubles and is still increasing. The total expenditure of the 1939 national budget (including the budgets of the various federal republics and local budgets) is 154,957 million rubles, while the previous year's was 123,996 million rubles. About two-thirds of this expenditure is for the national economy and social and cultural undertakings, including national economic expenditures of 59,310 million rubles, social and cultural undertakings expenditures of 38,564 million rubles, and expenditures of the People's Defense Committee and the Naval Committee of 40,885 million rubles. Capital investment in construction work occupies an important part of the budget. Of the total national economic construction funds of 34,730 million rubles, 25,100 million rubles are allocated within the budget. Of the total amount of social and cultural undertakings expenditures, 38,564 million rubles, education expenditures account for 21,051 million rubles, health expenditures 8,812 million rubles, social insurance expenditures 2,342 million rubles, and state subsidies for mothers and children 1,000 million rubles. Of the education expenditures, middle and primary school expenditures account for 7,688 million rubles, urban and rural school construction expenditures 485 million rubles, and boarding school construction expenditures 178 million rubles. In the 1939-40 school year, there will be 34.8 million students in various schools, an increase of 3.4 million over the current number. Kindergarten expenditures are 1,368 million rubles, cadre training expenditures 7,215 million rubles, and scientific research work expenditures 903 million rubles. Capital investment expenses are not included, and the funds directly used for scientific research by various economic organizations are also very large. The budget revenue and expenditure of the various federal republics have increased year by year, and the total number has increased by 326.1 percent compared to 1932. This year, the total amount of the budgets of the various federal republics and local budgets is 38,644 million rubles, an increase of 12.4 percent over the previous year, of which the Turkmen Republic increased by 22.4 percent, the Kazakh Republic 20.1 percent, and so on. The main expenditure in the budgets of the various states and local budgets is for social and cultural undertakings. Regarding defense expenditures in the budget, Zverev said, "The Soviet Union's powerful Red Army, Navy, and Air Force are reliable guardians of peace, ready to respond to the challenge with one or two fists in unison with the entire people. Our people are willing to further strengthen our country's defense. The draft 1939 Soviet National Budget submitted by the government for approval is a clear testament to the growth of the socialist country in all aspects under the leadership of the great Stalin."

<h3>Recent Developments in Europe</h3>
<p>— Uncle Di</p>
<p>The Fate of the World and the Future of the Far East (Continued)</p>
<p>European Correspondence</p>
<p>There is a second matter. According to the latest opinions of German military authorities, if Germany wants to expand again, it must, in any case, obtain the prior condition of non-interference, or the inability to interfere, from the Soviet Union. According to their estimates, if this can be achieved, then Germany and Italy can immediately make territorial demands on England and France. England and France would absolutely not dare to go to war, and even if they did, England would definitely withdraw halfway, leaving France to be slaughtered by Germany and Italy. Therefore, when Japan recently raised the issue of attacking the Soviet Union to Germany, Germany immediately rejected it. Subsequently, Germany presented new ideas to Japan, which were roughly as follows: (1) The ultimate decisive point in the current Sino-Japanese war lies in the overall situation in Europe, not in East Asia; if Japan continues to fight like this, it will definitely end in failure; (2) If Japan further echoes Germany and Italy in threatening England and France, enabling Germany and Italy to achieve a decisive victory in Europe, then at that time, Germany and Italy would be willing to exert all their strength to help Japan deal with the Soviet Union; (3) In order to fulfill its current tasks, Japan should adopt a completely defensive posture on all battlefields in China; but at the same time, send a naval fleet to the Mediterranean and a considerable amount of land and air forces to Africa. Although this plan has not been realized, it is very clear that Germany and Italy currently have no intention of dealing with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Because of these phenomena, in the current United Kingdom, there is widespread concern about a tacit understanding between Germany and the Soviet Union. Here are two examples: The first is a recent warning that appeared in the Times, issued by its Rome correspondent, who reminded the British people not to forget what Hitler said in 1930: that he wanted [to give India to the Soviet Union; to divide Africa among Italy.] The second is a sentence in a book currently being discussed and noted by many people in England. The book is a recent work by an American, Dr. Drucker, entitled The End of Economic Man, and the famous saying is: [From any angle, a rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Germany is almost inevitable. Unless there is a large-scale war in the near future, it may be possible to prevent it. -- The so-called near future is 1940, the last period.] This famous saying was written long before the UK changed its policy this time, but it is still worth noting.</p>
<p>However, what has been said in this section can only be regarded as shadows from the perspective of England and France; in addition, there has recently been a bright side to it. What is the bright side?</p>
<p>(III) From the perspective of internal divisions in the United Kingdom, the re-approachment between England and Germany is even more distant.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the large pro-German group within the United Kingdom represents the interests of the financial community, banking capitalists, nobles, and feudal landlords, the so-called Cliveden Set. Among them, the figures hailed as strongmen are: the current Foreign Secretary Halifax, the Times editor Dawson, the newly appointed ambassador to the United States Lord Lothian, and the Observer editor Garvin, etc. And especially the ones whose names are listed above have always been strong proponents of pro-Germanism. Now, however, they have all changed their tune and taken an anti-German stance. Even more noteworthy than these people is the changed attitude of Astor, the owner of the Observer, who is the host of the [Cliveden Set]. Astor, who has always been considered the unofficial spokesperson for German diplomacy in the United Kingdom, is now openly advocating that the United Kingdom can no longer make concessions. This is truly a big change!</p>
<p>In recent days, Prime Minister Chamberlain has been constantly wavering on a fork in the road: the Soviet Union? Or simply give in to Germany to the end? And every time he met with the above-mentioned figures from the [Cliveden Set], he received advice, unlike before, that he should absolutely no longer yield to Germany. Now, the only person who seems to retain his original position and advocates continuing pro-Germanism is Wilson, the current advisor to Chamberlain. However, his voice, compared with the widespread calls for alliance with the Soviet Union throughout the United Kingdom, in fact, seems to be no match even for the humming of a mosquito.</p>
<p>However, these are merely indications of a major trend. As for how they will manifest when it comes to actual individual issues, that is, of course, another question. For example, what about the Danzig issue? Now, no one dares to predict what attitude the United Kingdom will take.</p>
<p>Germany is also aware of the recent changes in the attitudes of pro-German figures in the United Kingdom. Therefore, in order to salvage the situation, last week, Germany, through its "UK expert," the current Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, sent his confidant Baron Geyr to the United Kingdom to conduct various activities in social circles. As soon as this Geyr arrived in the United Kingdom, he immediately gathered all the pro-German figures in and out of power to exchange many views, but the effect seemed to be not very great. And the biggest failure was that the news of German-Soviet negotiations that he spread after Litvinov's departure was immediately solemnly denied by the Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Maisky.</p>
<p>Just by looking at Foreign Secretary Halifax's delighted expression after Ambassador Maisky's denial, it is immediately clear how eagerly the United Kingdom hopes to approach the Soviet Union and distance itself from Germany today.</p>
<p>(IV) The Formal Declaration of the German-Italian Military Alliance and Japan's Halfway Retreat The existence of the German-Italian military alliance is not new; and the recent formal declaration did not cause any surprise. However, what caused a slight surprise was Japan's halfway retreat. From Japan's standpoint, this move is very detrimental to itself. Having repeatedly declared that it wants to create a [New Order in East Asia], and the policy of maintaining the Nine-Power Treaty by the United States, England, and France, which have already emphasized sending [final opinions] to Japan, has, in fact, severed any room for compromise. Does this mean that it has already planned to admit defeat and prepare to abandon the so-called [New Order in East Asia]?</p>
<p>Obviously, this is not the case. In today's United Kingdom, the prevailing explanations seem to be only two: (1) The US fleet's return to the Pacific, (2) The success of China's resistance war.</p>
<p>According to news received here, Japan had originally agreed to send a navy to the Mediterranean to demonstrate; later, after seeing the tough attitude of Foreign Minister Ciano, who was responsible for the liaison, Japan suddenly became afraid; it was naturally afraid that things would turn out to be true, and a real war would break out with England and France. Therefore, it hesitated. As a result, its ambassador to Italy almost resigned in anger.</p>
<p>However, this is by no means a reason to withdraw from the military alliance. Japan does not dare to fight against China, England, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union; in fact, do Germany and Italy currently have the courage to really fight?</p>
<p>Of course, the United Kingdom still wants to dismantle Japan from the aggressive group; however, the United Kingdom's attitude towards the Soviet Union and China has its own considerations and is by no means fundamentally changed because of Japan's move.</p>
<p>Japan's move, apart from chilling the hearts of Germany and Italy, seems to have few other effects; its already isolated position is even more isolated. Judging only from the application of individual diplomatic tactics, this is indeed a very meaningless and very flustered move for itself. However, judging from various signs, this retreat may only be temporary. If it does not admit defeat and insists on creating some [New Order in East Asia], then, given the trend of the times, even if it knows that Germany and Italy are taking risks, it will inevitably be dragged in eventually.

<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Swatow; Foreign Firms All Relocate; Various Foreign Firms Repeatedly Damaged by Bombs; Japanese Planes Raid Swatow Four Times on the 14th</h3>
<p>Swatow Correspondence: Recently, several ships on the Foochow-Amoy-Swatow route, those of Norwegian nationality, have been captured, losing over ten ships, and the losses are heavy. Realizing that there is no naval force to escort them, starting from the 12th, they automatically suspended navigation along the South China coast. British ships, such as the Sigger and others, had previously been captured by Japanese warships and taken to Taiwan. The Xinhai Gate and Mannan ships were also intercepted by Japanese warships. Then, on the 12th, the Haitan and Fu Kaisi, which were berthed in the port of Swatow to unload cargo, were strafed by low-flying Japanese planes, killing and wounding many workers. At that time, they crammed into the inner cabins to avoid the bombs, or jumped into the sea to swim for their lives, but several drowned again. A British warship was in the port to escort, but there was no way to help. Other foreign merchants who suffered losses due to Japanese planes attacking Swatow, such as the American Zhonghe Foreign Firm, were bombed and destroyed, and foreign casualties were the same as those of the Chinese. When a bomb landed next to the British Jardine Matheson Foreign Firm, shrapnel shot into the firm, injuring several workers. The roofs of the various foreign firms on the Western Bund were pierced by countless bombs. Therefore, all the foreign merchants in Swatow, starting from the 11th, have moved all the goods stored in the Swatow warehouses to Jiaoshi across the sea.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 14th, the Japanese aircraft carrier Notoro returned from southern Fujian to the waters off Nan'ao. On that day, it dispatched planes to attack Swatow city four times. At 8 a.m., the first raid came, with three planes entering the city to drop bombs and five planes dropping bombs in the horse market. Five planes flew low over Ma Kou, Jiaoshi, Chaoyang, and other places for reconnaissance. Foreign residents who had taken refuge in Jiaoshi were uneasy and entered mountain caves. A total of six bombs landed near the Han Di ice factory, the Xinghua Daily, and the water tower on Fu Ping Road in Swatow, causing considerable damage. At 1 p.m., three Japanese planes made a second raid, dropping a bomb in the Xiao Gong Yuan, the most prosperous area in the city center, destroying five or six shops, including the Lianhe Pharmacy. A total of three bombs landed on Mian'an Street and Tongjin Street, destroying seven or eight warehouses. Two bombs landed on the side of the Huilan Bridge. When leaving, they strafed various boats and ferries along the coast, and then returned to shoot, only leaving when they ran out of ammunition. At around 2 p.m., the third raid on Swatow took place, and planes also flew to Chaoyang Daho to wreak havoc. Four Japanese warships were docked at Daho. Guided by the planes, they bombarded Phoenix Island with sixteen shells. Two power plants on the island caught fire and burned, killing and wounding over a hundred people and destroying seven civilian houses, killing and wounding over ten people. At around 4 p.m., the fourth raid on Swatow took place. The British ship Haitan was strafed the most, killing and wounding many workers. Although a large Union Jack was painted on the ship, it was completely useless. The roofs of various foreign firms in Swatow were also hung with large British and American flags, but Japanese planes opened fire and strafed, with bullets flying wildly towards those places. As for the highways in Chaozhou and Swatow, many houses were destroyed. The railway began to be dismantled in the Swatow section on the 15th. More than half of the people in Swatow city have been evacuated. The authorities are still emphasizing evacuation, with a deadline of the 20th. Empty houses and shops in the city will be sealed by the police to prevent people from hiding inside.</p>
<h3>Two Japanese Planes Harass Dinghai; Drop Bombs in Shenjiamen; Japanese Warships Also Appear Three Times</h3>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence: At 12:50 p.m. on the 19th, two Japanese planes invaded the airspace over Dinghai from the southwest, at an altitude of about 1,000 meters. After several minutes, they flew to the sky above Shenjiamen, a town in Dinghai, circling and spying. Then, they used machine guns to strafe the area along the river street for five minutes, firing over a hundred rounds in total. Afterwards, the two planes flew northeast and strafed the Yinjiawan area again. According to farmers in Huangshawan, machine gun fire was heard in the Putuo area, which seemed to be the planes strafing as well. An investigation after the fact revealed that three people were injured. In addition, Japanese planes machine-gunned the Shenjiamen urban area, with bullets landing at various locations such as Dongheng Tang Tongsou Tai Sauce Garden, Dai Yu Rope Shop, Shunchang Xiang Clock Shop, Da Wan Pavilion, Dingfeng Southern Goods Shop, and the Changfa Inn on Xin Street.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Sail into Dinghai</p>
<p>At around 5 a.m. on the 20th, a Japanese warship, No. 14, followed the Hana wheel from the Luomen Sea into the Toutuo Port, anchoring and berthing about 1,000 meters from the shore. Upon hearing the news, Chinese military units rushed to the coastal area to deploy defenses and prohibited anyone from passing through to Toutuo. Seeing that the Chinese side was prepared, the Japanese warship sailed west out of Zhutianmen at 5:30 a.m. At 3 p.m., it sailed into Toutuo Port again from the Zhutianmen side, anchoring and berthing. After half an hour, it raised its fire again and sailed on its way. However, at 9:40 p.m., it suddenly sailed into Toutuo Port again and berthed. Upon hearing the news, the Chinese authorities immediately dispatched troops to Toutuo to deploy defenses, but in less than half an hour, it still escaped along its original route. From time to time, it seems to have something up its sleeve.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Market Prices Remained Weak; The Japanese Yen Could Not Recover From Its Decline; "Huaxing" Used a Large Amount of Legal Tender to Purchase; It Rose Slightly at One Point But Soon Fell Again; The Expansion Plan Approved by the Japanese Diet Has Already Been Implemented</h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that this morning (the 26th), the Japanese yen was once again weak on the foreign exchange market in Shanghai. Exchange shops sold 100 Japanese yen for 94.60 yuan in legal tender and bought it for 94.20 yuan.</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that yesterday afternoon (the 25th), it was learned from sources in the Chinese and foreign financial communities that the pseudo-Huaxing Commercial Bank used legal tender on the open market yesterday to buy Japanese yen in an attempt to support the declining price of the Japanese yen, causing the Japanese yen to continue to fluctuate yesterday. After the Japanese yen fell to a new low of 88 yuan, the pseudo-bank entered the market on Tuesday afternoon and</p>
<p>Began Buying Large Amounts of Japanese Yen</p>
<p>As a result of this manipulation, the price of the Japanese yen increased to 91 yuan before the market closed in the evening. On Wednesday morning, the Huaxing Bank continued to buy, forcing the Japanese yen exchange rate to increase to 93 yuan. It maintained this rate throughout the day. Yesterday morning, the pseudo-bank continued to buy in large quantities, and the exchange rate increased to 97 yuan. In the afternoon, the Huaxing Bank's purchases became looser, and the Japanese yen fell sharply. Before the market closed, its rate fell to 95 yuan. The price of the Japanese yen in exchange shops last night</p>
<p>Still Hovered Around 95 Yuan</p>
<p>However, some brokers were only asking for 94.50 yuan. Although the exact figures for the Japanese yen purchased by the Huaxing Bank since Tuesday afternoon could not be obtained, it is widely believed that it reached several million yuan. Foreign financial circles in the city believe that this move by the pseudo-bank is an exact action by the Japanese bank or the Japanese government to support the Japanese yen in the Shanghai market and at the same time support the "Lianzhun" currency and the Hua Yu currency issued in the Shanghai area, which has been a pillar for several weeks.</p>
<p>Both Pseudo-Currencies Have Fallen Sharply</p>
<p>The Huaxing currency is still circulating on a "black market" basis in the area north of the Suzhou Creek. Yesterday afternoon, exchange shops sold 155 Huaxing currency for 100 yuan in legal tender. Of course, this was only in the case of there being buyers. The rumor that only 10 million Japanese yen in banknotes are currently circulating in the Shanghai area, which was spread several days ago, has been denied by reliable Chinese and foreign buyers. Although they do not have exact figures for the amount of Japanese yen in Shanghai, they claim that its value is between 50 million and 100 million Japanese yen.</p>
<p>Western Newspapers Discuss Price Drop Factors in Detail</p>
<p>According to the Miller's Review, 100 Japanese yen could buy 130 yuan in legal tender a year ago. In January of this year (five months ago), 100 Japanese yen was equal to 110 yuan in legal tender. Last week, it was only worth about 90 yuan in legal tender. On Tuesday of this week, the Japanese yen plummeted, and 100 yuan could only buy about 80 yuan in legal tender. Before the Japanese authorities can stop the Japanese yen from falling, it is still unknown to what extent the Japanese yen will fall. Some financiers predict that the Japanese currency is trending towards</p>
<p>Becoming Obsolete</p>
<p>Like the Russian ruble and the German mark of the old days. Since the Sino-Japanese War began two years ago, Japan has been handling its finances secretly. Even the Japanese themselves do not seem to know the true value of the Japanese currency. The collapse of the Japanese currency is due to a variety of factors, the main one being inflation, the printing of too many unsecured bank notes. In January 1937, the amount of Japanese banknotes in circulation was 1.5 billion yuan. In December 1938, it increased to 2.9 billion yuan. Now,</p>
<p>The Official Announcement</p>
<p>Is 2.5 billion yuan. This means that the purchasing power of the Japanese currency has greatly decreased. The sharp increase in prices in Japan is clear evidence of this. The Japanese government is trying to maintain the stipulated exchange rate of the Japanese yen against foreign currencies in Japan at three yen to one US dollar by fraudulent methods. However, the Japanese government cannot control the situation in Shanghai. The Japanese yen has already shown a downward trend here in its attempt to achieve its natural leveling. As a result, according to the exchange rate of six Japanese yen to</p>
<p>One US Dollar</p>
<p>You can now buy Japanese yen in exchange shops in Shanghai. Now, with one US dollar, you can get seven Japanese yen, and the value of the Japanese yen seems to be declining daily. The Japanese army's influx of about 200 million Japanese yen into North and Central China is also a major reason for the sharp drop in the Japanese yen in Shanghai. This huge amount of banknotes was brought by the Japanese army to pay for goods. It is said that the current amount of Japanese banknotes in Shanghai is estimated at 50 million yuan, and a huge amount of Japanese yen has been</p>
<p>Taken to Tianjin</p>
<p>To exchange for the Japanese-backed pseudo-currency "Lianzhun," and then the pseudo-currency is exchanged for Japanese yen or legal tender to make huge profits. Major Japanese companies and foreigners have been engaged in this kind of buying and selling. Another factor in the collapse of the currency is the Japanese army's issuance of unsecured currency other than the Japanese yen on the Chinese market. One is the so-called "military scrip" that the Japanese army forced Chinese shopkeepers and laborers in the occupied areas to accept. This kind of</p>
<p>Never Withdrawn</p>
<p>The amount of banknotes is not known, but it must be very large. Its decision is for the unsecured "Lianzhun" currency issued in Tianjin and the so-called "Hua Yu" currency in Shanghai. It is said that the Japanese-controlled banks have issued more than 200 million yuan in banknotes in North China. This kind of currency has now plummeted and is far below the normal legal tender that they are trying to exclude. The new Huaxing currency that the Japanese have just issued in Shanghai has plummeted even before it was issued. Although the Japanese are claiming that they will take steps to guarantee the supply of this currency, there has been no concrete action.</p>
<p>The Japanese Yen Has Lost Its Credit</p>
<p>As a result of these and other factors, the Hua Yu currency plummeted at the beginning of this week, requiring 160 yuan to buy 100 yuan in legal tender. The Japanese side "pegs" the Lianzhun currency to the Japanese yen in Tianjin, but it is unable to do so in Shanghai. Other factors in the collapse of the Japanese currency in Shanghai include the Japanese army's ban on the sale of soybeans worth 3 million Japanese yen per month to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Another Factor</p>
<p>Is that 8,350 Japanese people come to Shanghai from Japan every month, each carrying the legal limit of 500 Japanese yen. Therefore, a total of 4 million Japanese yen flows into Shanghai every month, totaling 50 million yuan per year. Another factor is due to the Japanese army's restriction on the normal transportation of huge amounts of Japanese goods into China. The Japanese have also attempted to force Japanese merchants to sell goods in countries that can obtain currencies with foreign exchange value. The spokespersons of the Japanese army and navy here explained that the Japanese yen</p>
<p>Price Plunge</p>
<p>Was purely a "local" event and had little real significance. This explanation is inconsistent with the facts. The Japanese side has tried to limit the amount of Japanese yen that travelers and even merchants can bring back to Japan in order to desperately fill the "Shanghai loophole" of the Japanese yen, but to no avail. The truth of this situation is that the delayed expansion, which was approved at the recent meeting of the Japanese Diet, has already been implemented, but it is being kept</p>
<p>Secret From The Public</p>
<p>The reason why they can keep it secret is that it is difficult for officials to maintain the exchange rate, the government maintains police control, and prevents the increase in retail prices. But now it is no longer possible to keep this secret. Although officials are trying their best to prevent it, shopkeepers are willing to offer higher exchange rates than the official rates in order to obtain foreign currencies. Prices have finally risen, making it temporarily possible to prevent the Japanese currency from falling in Shanghai, but this is only a temporary effort. The financial health of any country that does not allow its own currency to be brought back to its own country is already in a precarious state.</p>
<h3>The Tianbao, Bode, and Princess Ships Have Been Released After Negotiations; Public Ships Resume Navigation to Dinghai and Wenzhou; There is Also News of the Release of the Detained Portuguese Ships</h3>
<p>The German merchant ship Tianbao, the Norwegian merchant ship Bode, and the Gongsheng, and other ships that were detained have been released after negotiations and will immediately resume their original routes. The German Weijin ship is expected to be released soon. As for the large number of Portuguese ships that were detained, there is hope for their release after Japanese Consul Miura returns to Shanghai and continues negotiations. The following is a report from the Daguan News Agency reporter on the various situations:</p>
<p>Tianbao, Bode, and Princess Released</p>
<p>(1) The Tianbao ship of the German Shiyide Foreign Firm, which sails between Ningbo, Dinghai, and Qiantang, was previously detained by a Japanese warship in the Dinghai waters and forced to berth in the Yangshupu River. After negotiations by the German Consulate General in Shanghai, the Japanese side confirmed that it was indeed owned by German merchants. Therefore, it was released on the morning of the 25th. The ship is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Dinghai at 12 noon today to resume the Ningbo-Dinghai route. (2) The Norwegian merchant ship Bode is represented by the Taiping Shipping Company and has been sailing the Shanghai-Fujian route. It was previously detained on its way to Fujian and forced to sail to Penghu Island. After negotiations by the Norwegian Consul, it was also released and returned to Shanghai, and it was released directly to Wenzhou yesterday afternoon. (3) The Norwegian merchant ship Gongsheng, which also sails the Shanghai-Fujian route, is represented by the Xinchang'an Company. It was detained by a Japanese warship outside the port of Fujian and forced to sail to Taiwan. It has now also been released after negotiations and has safely arrived in Fuzhou. It will soon sail from Fujian to Shanghai to resume its original route. (4) The German merchant ship Weijin of the Hentsch Foreign Firm has been detained for many days. There have been rumors of its release for a long time. It is now known that its release has been delayed by a few days because some procedures have not been completed.</p>
<p>There is Also News of the Release of Portuguese Ships</p>
<p>Regarding the more than ten Portuguese ships, Tangbei, Tangqiao, Tanglu, Meida, Hailong, etc., which were successively detained by Japanese warships and forced to berth in the Yangshupu River, former Portuguese Consul General to Shanghai, Melfes, repeatedly negotiated. The Japanese side stated that the nationality needed to be investigated, so there was no result. The Portuguese flags originally hoisted by the ships were forced to be removed, so the situation was quite bad. Since the new Consul General, Meiji, took office, he has continued to handle the negotiations. The stalemate of the case seems to have been broken. The Japanese side has also notified that the original national flags are allowed to be re-hung. According to the Daguan News Agency reporter's inquiries with the various shipping companies, Japanese Consul General Miura will return to Shanghai from Japan today or tomorrow. At that time, the Portuguese Consul will definitely raise the negotiations again. Moreover, the consul has provided conclusive proof that the ships are indeed of Portuguese nationality, so it is expected that they can also be released soon.</p>
<h3>The Market Has Returned to Normal; Rice Prices Continue to Fall; Concession Authorities Stop Rice Price Manipulation; Ample Rice Arrival Ensures No Shortage of Food for the People</h3>
<p>The people of this city have no need to worry about food, as various rice industry groups have exerted their efforts to facilitate the transportation of rice, leading to a daily increase in supplies, with carts arriving continuously. Prices have stabilized, bringing peace of mind, and buyers are adopting a wait-and-see approach. As a result, the spot market is oversupplied, and rice prices have rebounded and fallen sharply. Moreover, a second batch of imported rice is expected to be traded soon and shipped to Shanghai for regulation. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rice Prices Rebound and Fall Sharply</p>
<p>Thanks to the concerted efforts of various rice industry groups to facilitate the transportation of domestic rice, supplies have increased, prices have stabilized, and there is no fear of food shortage. Furthermore, with the arrival of the plum rain season, hoarding households are releasing their stocks, causing rice prices to fall sharply. Yesterday, the market price for top-grade white rice had fallen to 17.2 yuan. With buyers adopting a wait-and-see approach, the spot market is flooded with goods, and supply exceeds demand. Some domestic merchants have purchased more than 5,000 bags, but the market is hesitant to make decisions due to the sharp decline. The market order is expected to return to normal, with a total of over 8,000 bags traded yesterday.</p>
<p>Second Batch of Imported Rice Expected to Be Traded</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from rice industry groups yesterday that, regarding the purchase of imported rice, in addition to the first batch of 20,000 bags (equivalent to 2,000 tons) negotiated by Telegraph with Da Fu Foreign Firm, scheduled to be shipped from Saigon at the end of this month or early June for regulation in Shanghai, a second batch is also being negotiated by Telegraph with the same firm. It is reported that this batch of imported rice is over 2,500 tons, but the price is said to be slightly higher (a dime or two per bag) than the first batch. Once the negotiation is completed, it will be shipped to Shanghai in batches.</p>
<p>Rice Industry Groups to Hold Joint Meetings</p>
<p>Since the Rice Industry Group Evaluation Committee voluntarily disbanded, it has reported to the two concession authorities that it is unable to implement price limits due to insufficient resources and capabilities. However, since receiving the letter, the concession authorities have been quite concerned about the food supply in Shanghai. In addition to dispatching personnel to investigate the amount of rice stored in the city and working with police officers to intervene, they have also sent a letter to the Bean and Rice Trade Association, hoping that the Evaluation Committee will resume its organization as soon as possible and continue to implement price limits. It is said that various rice industry groups in this city, considering the need to restore the Evaluation Committee, will hold a joint meeting of rice industry groups to discuss</p>
<p>Measures to Ensure Ample Food Supply as Various Regions Lift Restrictions</p>
<p>Previously, due to various reasons, rice-producing areas had successively prohibited the export of rice and levied heavy taxes, causing merchants from various regions to hesitate and supplies to become scarce, resulting in a reduction in inventory. The food supply in this city once experienced a panic. Recently, due to the lifting of restrictions in various regions such as Suzhou, Wuxi, Wuhu, Changzhou, and Changshu, supplies have increased and inventory has grown daily. The total amount of rice stored in the city is over 550,000 bags. Yesterday, two or three ships from various regional gangs arrived at the river, and a total of 3,500 bags arrived by land and water. However, because the purchase price in the producing areas is around 17 yuan, the selling price is still subject to the previously set limit of 15 yuan.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Concerned About Food Supply</p>
<p>The above is a letter from the Food Supply Adjustment Committee of the French Concession Board of Directors to the Rice Industry Evaluation Committee, which states: "Dear Sirs, your committee has been working hard to balance rice prices and restrict speculators from manipulating the market. However, in the past two weeks, although rice storage and arrivals have been very ample, rice prices have been rising, which is clearly due to speculators trying to obtain undue profits. The Committee has jointly decided with the Shanghai Public Concession Engineering Bureau to fix the terms and will work with the police officers of the British and French Concessions to take necessary actions. The Committee is pleased to know that your committee frequently meets to discuss issues such as the regulation of food supply and the restriction of rice prices. The Committee is very grateful for all the assistance your committee has provided and expresses its special thanks."</p>
<h3>French Naval Commander Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, Vice Admiral Decoux, Commander of the French Far East Fleet, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning (the 26th). The French Consul General, Baudizzone, the Chargé d'Affaires, Nobel, and a guard of honor greeted him at the pier. It is reported that the Vice Admiral's visit to Shanghai is to discuss with the captain of the French mail steamer Aramis the recent accidental incident between the ship and the Japanese Navy.</p>
<h3>Save Dragon Boat Festival Expenses and Donate to Refugee Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association recently sent a circular to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and its affiliated citizen groups, hometown groups, amateur actor groups, dance hall groups, and trade groups, which states: "Dear Sirs, at the end of last year, your groups and businesses saved expenses from year-end banquets and donated to help the refugees, which we deeply appreciate. It is customary for businesses in various industries to hold festive banquets not only at the end of the year but also during the Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival. As the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, we hope that you will inform the groups and businesses under your jurisdiction and earnestly follow the method used at the end of last year to save expenses and donate to our Association to benefit the refugees. We hereby send this letter accordingly, and we hope you will take it into consideration."</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Still in Shanghai, Residing in Shigemitsu Mamoru's Residence in Jiangwan; Wang's Repeated Attempts to Cross to Japan Have Failed</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Hong Kong on the 26th reports that Wang Jingwei is currently still in Shanghai, residing in Shigemitsu Mamoru's former residence in Jiangwan. Wang has repeatedly expressed to the Japanese his desire to go to Tokyo, but the Japanese side does not value him and has not given a definite answer, so he has not been able to make the trip. A few days ago, it was rumored in Shanghai that Wang had gone to Tokyo, which was probably due to this. It is now heard that Wang has requested to go to Japan for the third time, but it is not known how the Japanese side will respond. According to Wang's confidants, Wang knows that he has no power and has expressed to the Japanese side that if Wu Peifu is willing to serve as a puppet, he is willing to be his deputy. This shows that he is at the end of his rope. Wang's original intention was to use his past political position to curry favor with the Japanese, completely forgetting his deep-seated hatred for the nation. His shamelessness and degradation are not only despised by the entire country, but the Japanese also see through his trick of "buying empty and selling empty" and do not value him, so there are no results, only further highlighting his crimes. Now, he has even lowered his head and humbled himself, willing to be a second-class puppet. Even his confidants believe that this kind of shameless behavior is hopeless and are unwilling to continue to run errands for him, so the activities of Wang's party members in Shanghai have been quieter recently.</p>

<h3>Japanese Side Publicly Declares Inspection of All Transport Ships, Even Outside Chinese Territorial Waters, The Identity of Transport Ships Must Be Investigated</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, at a press conference held by the Japanese side yesterday (the 25th), the incident of Japanese soldiers boarding the mail steamers Lanpura and Aramis outside Hong Kong territorial waters on Wednesday was discussed. A Japanese naval spokesman explained that, in order to investigate the identity of the ships, the Japanese Navy reserves the right to board any ship, large or small, near the Chinese coast, even outside Chinese territorial waters, for inspection. The Japanese authorities have recently received intelligence that requires them to take this step to investigate</p>
<p>The identity of transport ships. When asked if Japanese troops would board foreign ships regardless of the cargo or passengers they were carrying, and if they had proven their identity, would they be detained? The spokesman replied that if a ship is used for military purposes to aid the Chiang regime, the Japanese authorities will find it difficult to release the ship. When asked what would happen if contraband was found on board, the spokesman replied that this was a difficult problem. A reporter asked if this was tantamount to a blockade without a declaration of war, and the spokesman replied that the Japanese authorities did not object to the trade of cattle. When asked if food and medicine were also within the scope of the coastal blockade, the spokesman said that if the goods were indeed for military use, a problem would naturally arise. Currently, the transport of goods from Japanese-occupied areas to other parts of China is strictly prohibited. A foreign reporter asked what the Japanese side would do if the navy of a third country decided to send troops to protect regular ships, and the spokesman said that this was</p>
<p>A difficult question to answer. He did not believe that the US Navy would do this. A reporter asked that the Aramis was a giant ship of 22,000 tons, and China did not have ships of this size, and the ship was not in Chinese territorial waters when it was forced to stop. The spokesman replied that if necessary, the Japanese Navy would check the identity of all ships. As of yesterday, the Japanese side had not received any protests regarding the boarding of the Aramis. The spokesman finally firmly stated that the current situation in Gulangyu has nothing to do with the inspection of the two ships.</p>
<p>A French newspaper recorded that the French Shanghai Daily on the 26th reported that, regarding the Japanese inspection of the French mail steamer Aramis, at the Japanese press conference last night, the Japanese spokesman had a question and answer battle with reporters. The questions and answers between the two sides are briefly as follows: (Question) Can the spokesman explain the incident of the French mail steamer Aramis being inspected? (Answer) I do not know the details, but it is intended to find out its nationality.</p>
<p>Whose is the ship? (Question) The mail steamer is painted with the French tricolor flag. Didn't the Japanese troops see it? (Answer) There are many Chinese who falsely use the French flag. (Question) What law does Japan base its inspection of foreign merchant ships on? (Answer) Based on international law. (Question) If according to this law, foreign warships can also inspect Japanese merchant ships? (Answer) This is not possible. (Question) Is international law</p>
<p>Does Japan alone have this right? (Answer) Because Japan is fighting against China and has declared a blockade of the Chinese coast. (Question) Does this inspection have anything to do with the Gulangyu incident? (Answer) No relationship. (Question) If warships escort the ships, will the Japanese side also inspect them? The Japanese side avoided answering this question and stopped, but promised to report after finding out the facts.</p>
<h3>Baoshan Guerrillas Actively Attack Wusong; Guerrilla Reinforcements Arrive to Participate in the Battle; Japanese Build Defensive Works, Shanghai-Wusong Train Service Suspended</h3>
<p>The guerrillas in the suburbs of Baoshan have been actively attacking Wusong for days. Their advance troops encountered the Japanese military police the night before last, and the artillery fire was fierce, shaking the surrounding areas. At this moment, the rear troops of the guerrillas are rushing to join the battle day and night. The Japanese army is building defensive works in the city and along the river to prevent a major battle from breaking out. Starting yesterday, passenger trains between Zhabei and Wusong have been completely suspended, while Japanese military trains are constantly arriving to reinforce Wusong.</p>
<h3>Fresh Pork Industry Dispute; Concession Authorities Discuss Resolution; Three Principles Proposed for Consideration by the Industry; Limited Domestic Supply Makes Business Difficult</h3>
<p>Regarding the fresh pork industry and fresh meat industry in this city, after complying with the advice of the concession authorities and resuming business, the limited domestic supply and excessive demand continue to make the business outlook difficult. As for the dispute caused by the illegal interception of fresh pork by the Japanese puppets, the two authorities are discussing concrete solutions. The pigs on the Tonghe, a ship owned by the British company Jardine Matheson, which was previously detained by the Japanese Navy, will be released and shipped to Shanghai after negotiations. Details of each situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Limited Supply; Difficult Business</p>
<p>Over 2,000 businesses in the fresh pork and meat industries in this city were triggered to engage in a city-wide slaughtering suspension, weighing suspension, and business suspension dispute due to the illegal seizure of domestic fresh pork supplies by the puppet livestock market. The fresh pork and meat shops firmly stated that they would not resume business until a satisfactory solution was reached, and their spirit of sacrifice and courage won the sympathy of all sectors. Afterwards, the two concession authorities, fearing that the dispute would be prolonged and unresolved, and that events related to public security might occur, earnestly advised the two industry groups to protect the people's livelihood as a prerequisite, first weigh and sell the remaining pigs, and then try to facilitate supply. Therefore, all industry shops complied with the authorities' advice and resumed business. However, since the resumption of business, it has been nearly a week. Although the supply has not been cut off, the number of pigs shipped to Shanghai daily is only about two-tenths of what it used to be (400 to 500 heads in the two concession areas daily), which is very limited. The pigs slaughtered by the slaughterhouse should be sold on the market, and it is deeply felt that demand exceeds supply, so the market price continues to rise. Therefore, the business prospect of the fresh pork industry is still full of difficulties and it is difficult to be optimistic.</p>
<p>Authorities Discuss Solution</p>
<p>After the city's fresh pork and meat shops resumed business under the guidance of the authorities, regarding the dispute caused by the illegal interception of fresh pork supplies by the Japanese puppets, it is reported that the Public Concession Engineering Bureau and the French Concession Board of Directors are paying attention to the progress. In addition to proposing three principles and ordering the two industry groups to consider them carefully, they are also discussing concrete solutions and will negotiate with the Japanese side to resolve the issue as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Detained Pigs Released After Negotiation</p>
<p>Recently, most of the fresh pigs shipped to Shanghai from the interior are transported by Japanese ships to Hongkou and transferred to the "market", while a small portion is transported by foreign ships of German and Italian merchants to the two concession areas for unloading. As for British ships, they are still responsible for carrying them. However, after the Tonghe incident, general pig traders still have fear, so there is very little loading. All of the fresh pigs, more than 200 heads, loaded on the Tonghe, a ship owned by the British company Jardine Matheson, were detained by the Japanese Navy in Xinkang. After repeated negotiations by the British Consulate in China, it is heard that the detained pigs will be released soon.</p>
<h3>Two British Ships Resume Sailing to Zhangjiang, Escorted by Two Gunboats, Carrying Supplies and British Soldiers</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, at a press conference held by the Japanese side last night (the 25th), it was announced that two British merchant ships are scheduled to set sail from Shanghai next week and go directly to Hankou. The two ships are the Suiwo of Jardine Matheson and the Wuhu of Taikoo. The exact date of departure has not yet been announced, but it was reported last night by reliable sources in Shanghai that the two ships may depart on Monday or Tuesday. It is also heard that the</p>
<p>Two Gunboats</p>
<p>Of the British Yangtze Patrol will escort them. One of the two may be the Scorpion. Officials from Jardine Matheson and Taikoo yesterday admitted that they were trying to break through the Japanese blockade of the Yangtze River and engage in foreign trade. It is said that they intended to send the Suiwo and Wuhu to Hankou and had notified the Japanese authorities in detail, and the Japanese side had permitted it. This statement was confirmed by a Japanese naval spokesman last night. He replied to a</p>
<p>Foreign Reporter</p>
<p>Inquiry, admitting that the Japanese side had been notified by the two companies that they would send transport ships to sail. As far as he knew, the two ships would carry supplies and replacement soldiers to supply the British Navy stationed along the Yangtze River between Shanghai and Hankou, and would not carry passengers or commercial cargo. The statements of the officials from the two companies are also consistent with this statement. It was heard from reliable sources last night that the two ships will return to Shanghai after unloading their goods in Hankou. Although this trip by the two ships is not a prelude to opening up the Yangtze River for foreign navigation, it is the first time since the establishment of the Jiangyin barrier in the autumn of 1937 that British ships have sailed directly from Shanghai to Hankou, so it is of great significance.</p>
<h3>Submission of Building Plans for Review Must Be Accompanied by Payment of Review Fee; Public Announcement by the Engineering Department of the Public Concession</h3>
<p>When constructing buildings in the Public Concession, building plans must first be submitted to the Engineering Department of the Public Concession for review. In the past, the review fee was collected after the review was approved. Now, the Engineering Department has changed the method and changed it to collecting the fee in advance. Yesterday, a public announcement No. 5097 was specially issued, which states: "For the matter of public announcement, it is hereby announced that from May 31 of this year onwards, all building plans submitted for review must be accompanied by the payment of the fee to be collected at the time of submission, instead of collecting the fee when the building permit is issued, as is the current practice. The amount of the review fee to be paid will be notified to the applicant for review when the plans are submitted. Plans will not be reviewed without prior payment of the fee. This announcement is hereby made for the public to know."</p>
<h3>Zhenhai Suffers Another Bombing; Shanghai-Ningbo Route Not Affected; Shanghai-Dinghai and Shanghai-Wenzhou Ships Sail as Usual</h3>
<p>Zhenhai was bombed by four Japanese aircraft on the afternoon of the 22nd, and ten bombs were dropped, destroying more than fifty houses and killing or wounding nine civilians. According to news from the shipping industry, an air raid alert was issued in Ningbo at 8:00 a.m. on the 25th. Soon, six Japanese aircraft flew to Zhenhai and conducted low-altitude reconnaissance, and then dropped sixteen bombs in the Jiangnan Grand Parade Ground area. At 8:30 a.m., the alert was lifted in Ningbo. The extent of the damage is not known in detail due to the brevity of the telegram, but it is generally believed that most of the people in Zhenhai have been evacuated, and the area is mostly mountainous, so the damage should not be too great.</p>
<p>Shipping Unobstructed; Moufu Sails in the Morning</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Ningbo route was approved for resumption, the German ship Moufu has already made its first trial voyage back to Shanghai. The Italian ships Kangshayi and Deping have also sailed to Ningbo one after another, so traffic is gradually returning to normal. Although Zhenhai was bombed again the day before yesterday morning, it did not affect the traffic. The Moufu was originally scheduled to sail to Ningbo at 4:00 p.m. yesterday, but due to insufficient loading, it was decided to change the departure to 4:00 a.m. this morning and sail directly to Ningbo as usual. The report that the Shanghai-Ningbo route was temporarily suspended due to the bombing of Zhenhai was a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Dinghai and Shanghai-Wenzhou Ships Set Sail</p>
<p>After the German ship Harna of the Far East Company changed its route to Wenzhou, the Shanghai-Dinghai route was temporarily suspended. Now, the German ship Tianbao of the Siidewig, has been scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Dinghai at 12:00 a.m. today. The Norwegian ship Baode, agented by Da Xin Company, sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou yesterday. The British ship HSBC, agented by the Feng Hang Shipping Company, is scheduled to sail to Wenzhou today. The German ship Haifu of the Lihe Foreign Company is scheduled to sail to Wenzhou on the morning of the 30th.</p>
<h3>Future Relief Policy of the International Relief Committee; General Assembly Chaired by the Dutch Consul General; Subsistence to Be Assisted by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association</h3>
<p>At 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the International Relief Committee of this port held a general meeting of members on the ninth floor of the YMCA. Representatives of group members such as Jiang Junyi of the Chinese Red Cross, Zhang Lanping and Li Dixian of the World Red Swastika Society, Guan Jiongzhi of the Chinese Buddhist Association, Huang Hanzhi and Wen Lanting of the Shanghai Charity Federation United Relief Association, Lu Yigeng of the Catholic Action Association of China, Zhu Yinjiang of the Chinese and Foreign Volunteer Relief Association, and Wu Lifu of the Shanghai YMCA, as well as individual members such as伯奇, Hu Yongqi, Bai Dehan. Chen Heqin. Father Bashan. Mrs. Yudan, and others, more than thirty people, attended. The chairman of the Shanxi Association, the Dutch Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Boks de Wit, reported on the work done in the past year. Standing Committee member Ji Guiyong also spoke about the various difficulties currently encountered by the Committee, such as the economic aspect, which encounters difficulties every month. If the refugees are dismissed, most of them will have no home to return to. The Standing Committee has also reduced the efficiency of Committee affairs due to the departure or absence of several people. However, judging from the past work, whether in the management of reception centers, refugee education, or production activities, it has achieved excellent results and has been praised by people from all walks of life. Therefore, it is requested that the General Assembly make a public decision on where to go from now on. After unanimous approval by the group members present, it was decided that the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association should subsidize the monthly subsistence expenses, and that funds for medical, educational, and other expenses should be raised separately to maintain the status quo in order to avoid refugees becoming displaced.</p>
<h3>Luen Cheong Textile Factory to Resume Operations Next Week</h3>
<p>The Luen Cheong Textile Factory temporarily suspended operations due to environmental pressure after a labor strike. Now, in order to show consideration for the workers, the factory has decided to resume daily day and night shifts starting on May 29. However, it is said that workers who participated in the violence at the time will not be included in this decision.</p>
<p>According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, a Japanese source in this port said that the Japanese naval authorities have lodged a strong protest with the British military authorities this morning (the 26th) regarding the actions of a British sentry of the West Fort High Ground unit at the entrance of the Luen Cheong Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, on Wednesday afternoon. The incident occurred when Major Noji, the commander of the Japanese Marine Corps in Pudong, attempted to visit the commander of the West Fort unit stationed at the factory and was stabbed in the right hand by the British sentry with a bayonet. The civilian interpreter accompanying him was also stabbed in the chest. The British sentry also had a live round in his rifle and aimed it at the Japanese officer. A Japanese naval spokesman declared yesterday that the Japanese naval authorities "have no words to express their astonishment" at the sentry's actions towards the Japanese naval officer in uniform. The spokesman also revealed that a British military officer later met with Major Noji on the wharf by the river, but did not invite him into the factory. It is heard that the Japanese naval authorities</p>

<h3>Generator Explodes Suddenly at Yizhong Cigarette Factory in Lujiazui; All Locomotives Completely Shut Down; 3,000 Workers Forced to Temporarily Stop Working</h3>
<p>At the engine room of the British Yizhong Cigarette Factory (formerly the British-American Tobacco Factory) in Lujiazui, Pudong, at around 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, there was a loud bang, and the machine was immediately damaged, the current was interrupted, and all the locomotives in the cigarette rolling room, tobacco leaf room, and leaf room of the factory were completely shut down. More than 3,000 workers were forced to stop working. Repairs were carried out all day yesterday, but they have not yet been completed and it is impossible to make cigarettes, so the work of the two tin box units has also been affected and there is no way to pack. Therefore, the female workers in these two units will have one day off next Monday and will resume work on Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan Line Recaptured; Wujin Xutang; Xutang Is of Strategic Importance; Japanese Army Suffers Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Recently, the regular army and guerrillas scattered along the Jinghu Road on the Chinese side have become more active than before, making it quite difficult for the Japanese military authorities to deal with. According to a person who arrived in Shanghai from Taixing yesterday, on the 22nd of this month, the Jia Biaofu unit of the X brigade and X regiment of the standing army in northern Jiangsu, upon the order of Commander Zhang Shaohua, led its troops from Taixing to Jiangnan. At that time, they crossed to Xutang, which belongs to Wujin County on the opposite bank. The town was originally stationed with the Japanese Matsubara unit, and fierce fighting broke out between the two sides. After Jia's unit bravely charged and killed, the Japanese army was defeated, and Xutang was completely recaptured on the morning of the 23rd. In this battle, more than ten Japanese soldiers were killed and countless spoils of war were seized. The exact number is currently being checked and reported to superiors. Xutang is a transportation hub between Wujin and Tai counties, located at the mouth of the Jiangnan Flower Port, and its location is extremely important.</p>
<h3>The Hui Feng Society: Public Memorial Service Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Following the passing of Cixi poet Mr. Feng Huifeng, his disciples formed the Hui Feng Society. They hold two public memorial services annually to commemorate him. This year's memorial service will be held on May 28th (Sunday) at the Xiaoshi Middle School on Niuzhuang Road. Feng Weibao, Dong Zhenke, and Chen Qiuyang will preside over the service, followed by a luncheon.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Bathing the Buddha Festival: Grand Scene at Jing'an Temple</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the eighth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar, commonly known as the Bathing the Buddha Festival. Every year on this day, the Jing'an Temple in western Shanghai sees a large influx of pilgrims. Roads near the temple are lined with temporary stalls, creating a bustling market. This year, due to the current situation, the Municipal Council specifically prohibited the holding of a market. However, yesterday's pilgrimage was quite grand. From morning till night, devout Buddhist women streamed in an endless procession. There was barely room to stand in the main hall. The air was filled with incense smoke, and the heat of the candles was stifling. This spectacle continued until late at night. Furthermore, at the "First Spring Under Heaven" in front of the temple gate, many people released various animals and aquatic creatures as a form of "liberation of life." In reality, the spring is merely a name. The bottom of the spring is dry, so laborers continuously fish out the released creatures and resell them to people who want to liberate life. This cycle continues endlessly, a truly farcical scene.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Clarifies Doubts Regarding Income Tax: Dividends and Bonuses Are Taxed on the Individual</h3>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's clarification of income tax doubts, a letter was sent to member stores yesterday, stating: "We have received your letter inquiring whether dividends enjoyed by shareholders and bonuses received by employees should be subject to income tax, and requesting an explanation." The reply is as follows: "(1) The taxpayer for a company's profit income is the company itself. The taxpayer for the income from shareholder dividends and employee bonuses is the shareholder and employee themselves. In other words, the company is a legal person, while shareholders and employees are natural persons. If each has its own individual personhood, then each is a separate target for taxation. Income tax is a direct tax, also called a personal tax, which is different from indirect taxes, which are taxes on goods. The letter's claim of 'no double taxation' is due to a lack of understanding of the different natures of direct and indirect taxes. In reality, there is no duplication. (2) The second clause of the Ministry of Finance's 'Collection Guidelines for the Third Category of Securities Deposit Income Tax' stipulates that 'stock interest is limited to dividends from limited companies and joint-stock limited companies.' The collection guidelines are a supplementary regulation to the Provisional Income Tax Law. Therefore, according to this provision, income from stock interest is limited to dividends and does not include bonuses. (In legal terminology, dividends and bonuses are distinct terms. The term 'dividends' alone does not include bonuses; see Article 171, Section 1 of the Company Law.) (3) The Provisional Income Tax Law stipulates that income from salaries and remuneration, falling under the second category, is taxable. Year-end bonuses received by employees fall under the category of remuneration. However, this remuneration is calculated together with the monthly salary. If an employee's monthly salary is fourteen yuan and they receive a year-end bonus of one hundred and fourteen yuan, the combined average monthly income from salary and remuneration is less than the thirty yuan tax threshold, and therefore no tax is payable."</p>

<h3>Western District Terror Case Solved: Xue Guisheng and Zhu Gengsheng, Murderers Without Blinking, Like Mad Dogs Killing for Booty, Many Detectives and Constables Were Harmed, Xue Guisheng Has Already Hanged Himself in Prison</h3>
<p>The notorious bandit Xue Guisheng (also known as Lao Wu and Xiao Wuzi) used to specialize in armed gang robbery, committing numerous crimes. More recently, he falsely claimed to be the leader of a guerrilla unit and, with his accomplice Zhu Gengsheng (also known as Zhu Chenggui), repeatedly committed murder and robbery in the foreign concessions. On February 22nd of this year, between 9:20 AM and 9:30 AM, they committed as many as five cases of murder and attempted murder in just ten minutes. They can truly be called murderers without blinking an eye. The Jing'an Temple Police, together with Chinese and Western detectives from the French Concession Police, have arrested</p>
<p>Xue Guisheng and Zhu Gengsheng.</p>
<p>In addition to the two bandits, they have also detained seven accomplices, including Xu Haiquan (aka Xiao Shandong), Zhang Yucai, Xu Changsheng, Jin Huade, and Wang Xueyin. They seized a hand grenade, a Mauser pistol, a handgun, and forty-six bullets, and brought them to the police station. However, during the investigation, Xue Guisheng, knowing that his life had been filled with countless misdeeds, and that now that he had been arrested, he could not escape the law, hanged himself in the Jing'an Temple Police station jail on April 29th of this year. Fortunately, the police investigation into Xue's part was already completed, and a confession had been recorded. Therefore, Xue's suicide did not hinder the investigation. At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, Judge Fu Lin specially convened the</p>
<p>Special First Court's Second Criminal Division</p>
<p>for trial. The police also brought the defendants Xu Haiquan, Zhang Yucai, Zhu Gengsheng, Xu Changsheng, Jin Huade, and Wang Xueyin to court. The defendants were represented by several lawyers. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that defendant Zhu Gengsheng was being prosecuted under Articles 271, Sections 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code for murder and attempted murder. The other defendants were being prosecuted for intimidation, fraud, and other crimes. He stated that Zhu Gengsheng, in collusion with the deceased Xue Guisheng and more than ten others who are still at large, broke into a teahouse at 283 Xingjiapo Road in western Shanghai at 9:20 AM on February 22nd of this year, armed with Mauser pistols and handguns. Seven people stood guard outside, while four entered. At that time, a</p>
<p>tea drinker named Li Jinhai</p>
<p>(aka Li Hongtao) was sipping tea. The gang assumed that Li was their target and shot him once, hitting his left temple. He immediately fell to the ground, dead. Thinking that they had achieved their goal, the gang fled. Unexpectedly, nearby was the Zhenggda Textile Factory. Japanese patrolman Shibata Genichi No. 243 and Italian military officer Sig. Grandalla heard the alarm and went to investigate. The two sides exchanged gunfire. Zhu Gengsheng was shot in the left shoulder, but the wound was not fatal, so he</p>
<p>was able to flee while injured.</p>
<p>He fled from 451 Xingjiapo Road to 816 Roberts Road. There, "Great Way Municipal Government" Pseudo-policeman Zhang Ronghe No. 2341 was passing by on a bicycle. The gang shot and killed Zhang. As they fled past the ten-yard mark, a police patrol car No. 6 from the Chengdu Road Police Station was passing by, transporting a suspect they had arrested elsewhere. The gang thought that the patrol car was there to arrest them, so they opened fire. Liu Changming No. 165, a Chinese detective from the Chengdu Road Police Station who was standing in the patrol car, was unfortunately hit and killed. At this time,</p>
<p>the gang was like mad dogs.</p>
<p>Whenever they encountered a Chinese detective, they opened fire and resisted arrest. After fleeing a few steps, they encountered Western policemen Bardo and Canaro riding motorcycles towards them. The two sides exchanged gunfire again. In the end, the gang fled into Fahua Town via Jessfield Road and disappeared without a trace. In this incident, in the space of ten minutes, tea drinker Li Jinhai, "Great Way" pseudo-policeman Zhang Ronghe, and Chengdu Road Police Station detective Liu Changming were shot and killed one after another. Furthermore, at 9:30 AM on February 1st of this year, Geng Shoubao, the "Captain of the Detective Team" of the Great Way Municipal Government, was</p>
<p>assassinated by gunshot.</p>
<p>by Zhu Gengsheng and Xue Guisheng and their gang in 28 Zekang Lane, O'Donnell Road. At the same time, a stray bullet killed an old man, Liu Zijun, and injured four pedestrians. The police are currently only prosecuting defendant Zhu Gengsheng for the above cases. As for the other five defendants, Xu Haiquan, etc., from January to February of this year, they falsely claimed to be a guerrilla unit and sent letters to ten businesses, including the Zhongnan Tannery on Anhe Temple Road, the Hengfeng Flower Factory, the Kaiming Sugar Factory, the Anhe Canning Factory, the Linji Textile Factory in Fahua Town, the Shenfeng Textile Factory, the Zhengchang Iron Factory, the Xinji Dye Factory, the Fuxing Nail Factory, and the Xiaopi Tannery at 4 Xinmuqiao, extorting large sums of money. Furthermore, on February 8th, they</p>
<p>fired dozens of volleys</p>
<p>at the Zhongnan Tannery after their extortion attempt failed. They should be severely investigated according to the law. The confessions recorded by the police from each defendant are submitted to the court. Judge Fu, based on the confessions, questioned Zhu Gengsheng and the others in detail and ordered them to be detained pending a later hearing. It is reported that the deceased bandit Xue Guisheng also confessed that on March 1st of this year, he robbed the Anle Cotton Weaving Factory at 34A Burkill Road of more than three thousand yuan, and</p>
<p>shot and killed a Chinese policeman No. 2067.</p>
<p>His service pistol was also robbed. Furthermore, at 4 PM on August 22nd of last year, he opened fire at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road in an attempt to kill pseudo-"Shipping Director" Liu Xian and his son Liu Hongfu. On May 15th of the previous year, he robbed the Gongda Textile Factory at 60 Xingjiapo Road of 1,150 yuan and shot and killed the accountant, Mr. Lu. There were no fewer than twenty such cases.</p>
<h3>Encounters a Flashily Dressed Woman, Reaches Out and Gropes, Arrested by the Authorities</h3>
<p>Zhou Changbiao, a native of Ningbo, 28 years old, resides at 13 Qunyili, Ningbo Road. He works as a salesman for Yikang Yarn Company at Room 258, Hamilton House, Jiangxi Road. Recently, Zhou suddenly suffered a nervous breakdown and seems to have a sexual obsession. Whenever he goes out for business at noon, he always sees flashily dressed women passing by on the road and</p>
<p>reaches out and gropes.</p>
<p>Chinese women usually consider it a matter of shame if such an incident is publicized. Some will simply scold him and not pursue the matter, while others will ignore him. This has emboldened Zhou. Yesterday at noon, Zhou left the office and was walking along Jiangxi Road near Sijing Road when he suddenly fondled the lower body of a passing Russian woman, Lahuishigan Ya. A Westerner happened to be nearby and, seeing Zhou's inappropriate behavior,</p>
<p>felt indignant.</p>
<p>Chinese patrolman Wu Yaozu and Chinese constable No. 2561 arrived and arrested Zhou, taking him to the Central Police Station. This morning, he was escorted to the Special Second Court's First Criminal Division. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi prosecuted him for indecent assault under Article 224 of the Criminal Code. Judge Feng Shide, considering that the case involved public morals, ordered the courtroom to be closed to the public. Therefore, the details of the trial are unknown. The verdict was postponed to next Friday.</p>
<h3>Printing and Selling Pornographic Books, Fined One Hundred Yuan, Printing Plates Confiscated</h3>
<p>Huishi Police Station Deputy Patrolman Jin Mianceng and Western Patrolman Tuo Laote, Political Department Detective Zhang Yi, etc., recently ordered the relocation of all refugees along Alabast Road to the Western District. Several of the refugees, unwilling to move, fled into the Samsung Printing Shop at 5, Lane 129, North Zhejiang Road. The Chinese and Western patrolmen tracked them down and entered the shop. At that time, the printing shop was printing various pornographic books, such as "The Amorous History of Spring Qing," "The Lust Demon," etc., with extremely obscene language. They arrested the owners Yin Fengshi, partner Shen Wenjie, Hu Gancai, Feng Zishen, and Liu Yuanxiang. Along with thirty-four printing plates and seven volumes of pornographic books, they were taken to the police station. It was learned that the Samsung Printing Shop was opened by Yin A'er (i.e., Yin Xihan), and the shop workers were not involved. They were all released. A warrant was requested from the First Special Court, and a public prosecution was brought against Yin A'er. This morning, Judge Meng Tingke heard the case in the Fourth Criminal Division. Yin A'er did not appear, but sent a representative to respond to the charges. Police lawyer Qian Xunwan presented the case. Judge Meng examined the pornographic books and immediately sentenced Yin A'er to a fine of one hundred yuan. If the fine could not be paid, it could be commuted to forced labor at a rate of one yuan per day. The thirty-four printing plates were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Chen Zuoping Scams Customers and Flees with Goods, Both Police Departments Issue Wanted Notice with Reward</h3>
<p>Chen Zuoping (aka Chen Chaofan), a native of Chenghai, Chaozhou, 38 years old, formerly established the Desheng Shenzhuang at 7 Taiwan Road in the French Concession. Under the pretext of procuring goods in Shanghai for various Chaozhou businesses, he used bank and pawnshop checks to defraud businesses selling textiles, enamelware, sundries, etc., of goods worth five to six thousand yuan, sold them off at discounted prices, and then abandoned the store and fled. The creditors reported the matter to the French Concession Police, but he could not be found. They filed a complaint with the Second Special District Local Court, which approved the issuance of Wanted Notice No. 152. The creditors are offering a reward of two thousand yuan, which has been distributed to the British and French Concession Police for joint efforts in the arrest. Anyone who knows the whereabouts of Chen Zuoping (aka Chen Chaofan) should report it to the nearest police station. If the arrest is made as a result, the reward of two thousand yuan will be paid immediately.</p>
<h3>Yu Daxiong Murder Case, A Youth Arrested, Tracked Down in the Yangtze Dance Hall, Arrested in the Hongkou District on the 5th of This Month</h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reports that according to Japanese newspapers in this city, the Japanese military has captured Xu Ying (age 25, native of Wuxi), the murderer of Yu Daxiong, a "Reformed Government official" who used the alias Yu Shamin. It is claimed that the Japanese military has obtained important information about the various anti-Japanese terrorist groups in Shanghai. It is also claimed that military police from the Daxi Road Japanese Military Police Sub-Station, investigating suspected terrorists, arrested Xu Ying on May 5th in the Sichuan Temple on North Sichuan Road. At the time, Xu was in the temple, soliciting funds from a friend residing there to continue his anti-Japanese activities. Yu Daxiong was assassinated on October 16th of last year in Room 601 of the New Asia Hotel on Sichuan Road. Xu arrived in Shanghai in March of last year. Another party member, a Mr. Chen, was also involved in the New Asia Hotel assassination. Xu also admitted that on June 11th of last year, the three of them attempted to assassinate Yu on Hanjiang Road, but failed. Afterwards, they hid at 64 Limei Road in the French Concession. The Japanese military police learned of Xu's whereabouts in the Yangtze Hotel dance hall, as Xu frequented the dance hall.</p>
<h3>Hongkou Car Accident, Mrs. Liddell Testifies, Car Had Already Crossed Garden Bridge and Was Returning North, Japanese Soldier's Control of Steering Wheel Caused Great Calamity</h3>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that the inquest into the death of Lester School Principal Liddell, who died in a car accident near Broadway Road and Minhang Road on the evening of April 24th, continued yesterday (the 25th) with Coroner Hain presiding. Mrs. Liddell testified that at approximately 6:30 PM on the evening of the 24th, Mr. Plessey called at her husband's residence on Great Western Road. Her husband had forgotten two of his pipes on the *Grenayseno* liner, so they took Mr. Plessey's car to the east Doolittle Road. Liddell obtained his private car, and the witness and Mr. Plessey rode in the same car to the Jardine Wharf. The three boarded the *Grenayseno* together. They disembarked around 8:00 PM. Mr. Plessey drove away first. The witness and her husband rode in the same car. Because they had to turn around, they left the wharf later. They drove left onto Broadway Road. They did not see anything until they heard the sound of impact. She then realized that they had struck an obstruction. The glass of the right headlight was broken. No one attempted to stop them at that time, so they continued forward, down Broadway Bridge, across the Garden Bridge, to the vicinity of the British Consulate. Her husband stopped the car and reported to patrolman Wimsett. Mr. Wimsett</p>
<p>suggested returning to Broadway Bridge or going to the Hongkou Police Station. The three then got back into the car and drove back to the bridge. A Japanese sentry allowed the car to pass and stop along the creek. The Japanese sentry did not understand what Mr. Wimsett was saying. An off-duty Japanese person then arrived at the scene to act as an interpreter. However, the interpreter did not understand English very well either. Mr. Wimsett asked the interpreter to go to the Hongkou Police Station, but the person was unwilling to go. After Mr. Wimsett closed the door, Liddell drove forward again. As they drove across the bridge again, a sentry suddenly jumped onto the right running board of the car, without saying a word, tightly gripping the steering wheel and turning it to the right, causing the car to swerve from the left side of the road to the right side. Liddell drove the car back to the left side, but the sentry again turned it to the right. At this point, the sentry began to speak in English, shouting "Stop!" But Liddell could no longer control the car's movement, causing it to collide violently with a public bus coming from the opposite direction. The witness was injured in the face. The headlights of the public bus and the streetlights were very dim. The car was not moving fast after the Japanese sentry jumped on, the witness said. The coroner then questioned the other three witnesses and adjourned the hearing, scheduling it to continue next Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Friends Become Enemies, Gathering a Crowd to Commit Violence, Jiang Qiying Seriously Injured, All Assailants Arrested</h3>
<p>Jiang Qiying, a native of Haimen, 34 years old, resides at 1 Pingjili, Avenue Haig, works as a chauffeur. He drives for a Mr. Wu at 591 Lane, opposite the Continental Swimming Pool on Jing'an Temple Road. Shen Afu, a fellow chauffeur from Yangzhou, 49 years old, works as a driver for the Postal Bureau. The two used to have a harmonious relationship and were very close. Recently, however, they had disagreements and their contact became less frequent. Yesterday, they met again somewhere, and the two sides had a conflict. People mediated, and the matter was resolved. But Shen drove a car with six thugs, armed with axes and iron bars, to the entrance of 591 Lane and waited. Before long, Jiang was seen walking out after finishing work. The thugs rushed out of the car and struck Jiang's head with two axes. His whole body was injured by iron bars. When assaulted, Jiang was not willing to be weak. He grabbed an iron bar and struck Shen's wife (Hou, 48 years old, who had come along) in the back. She was severely injured. Policemen from 1388 Chengdu Road heard the alarm and arrived, arresting the assailants and taking them to the police station for investigation. The injured were sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Bank Guard Arrested, Conspiring to Kidnap Young Woman, Woman Was Previously Seduced and Hidden, Father Learned of It and Forcibly Dragged Her Home, Kidnapped Again, Whereabouts Unknown</h3>
<p>Liang Bifa, a native of Yancheng residing at 91 Tianzhutang Street, opposite the New North Gate in the French Concession, previously filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing his fellow townsman Zhou Butian, a guard at the New North Gate branch of the Bank of Communications, and his neighbors, also fellow townsmen, Ni Fengwu and his wife Ni Yan, of seducing and hiding his twenty-year-old daughter Liang Gendi, committing adultery, and disrupting the family. He requested a legal investigation and filed a civil suit, requesting that the daughter be returned. During the continuation of the trial on the 16th of this month, both plaintiffs and defendants appeared in court. Liang Gendi also arrived with a lawyer, stating that her father wanted to sell her to someone as a fourth concubine. When she refused, he used force to oppress her, so she left home to seek marital autonomy. She was not being seduced by the defendants. The case was concluded and adjourned. Liang Bifa, along with his brother-in-law Li Hongfu, attempted to forcibly drag the woman back, but she resisted and shouted for help. The courtroom became chaotic, and the bailiffs intervened. The judge reopened the trial. Because Liang Gendi insisted that she did not want to go home with her father, she was ordered to be temporarily detained in the detention center pending further instructions. On the afternoon of the 20th, the court announced the verdict, declaring the defendants not guilty and dismissing the accompanying civil suit. It ordered the plaintiff, Liang Bifa, to sign a guarantee promising not to mistreat or oppress the daughter, and that any marriage must be with the daughter's consent. But the daughter still firmly refused to return home. In the end, Liang Bifa and his wife, along with his brother-in-law Li Hongfu, forcibly carried the woman out of the court and put her in a car. After returning home, Liang feared that she would be enticed away again.</p>
<p>Therefore, he placed the daughter Liang Gendi in the care of her maternal uncle, Li Hongfu, at 9, Lane 451, Xingjiapo Road in western Shanghai. He sent people to guard her day and night to prevent any accidents. Yesterday, it happened to be the fast day of the Ritual and Righteousness Public Association. Li Hongfu went out on business, and his wife had to go to the lecture hall to burn incense. He left his niece Liang Gendi alone at home. Fearing an accident, he invited the woman to go to the lecture hall with him so that he could keep a close watch on her. However, as Li's wife was carrying incense and paper money, she and her niece Liang Gendi left the house and walked out of the lane. Before they had taken many steps, Zhou Butian's side</p>
<p>conspired with several men and women, pretending to have guns, to rush forward and kidnap the woman Liang Gendi. Li's wife, a woman with bound feet, was outnumbered. She watched her niece being kidnapped and went home to tell her husband Li Hongfu, who notified the girl's father, Liang Bifa, and reported to the relevant police station. Detectives were dispatched to the New North Gate branch of the Bank of Communications to arrest him, but Butian had already been dismissed from his position, so he could not be arrested. Detectives are now searching for the woman and Zhou Butian, hoping to arrest them and punish them according to the law.</p>
<h3>Husband in Love with Sister-in-Law, Appeal Suspended</h3>
<p>Xia Changyu of Wuxi, because of his love affair with his wife's younger sister, Xue Qi, lived with her as a pawnbroker at 12 Gujialong, Hualong Road in the French Concession. His wife, Xia Xue Huaishan, discovered this and reported it to the French Concession Police at 6:00 AM on April 5th. Detective Wu Wengang went with her and arrested Xia and Xue Qi, and sent them to the Special Second Court, where they were prosecuted for disrupting the family. The initial trial sentenced each to four months in prison. During the appeal period, they were held in the detention center pending instructions. Xia and the others were not satisfied and hired lawyer Wang Shizong to appeal to the Higher Third Branch Court. The Higher Third Branch Court deliberated and decided that Xia and the others should each provide a written guarantee of two hundred yuan, with the date for sentencing to be announced. These matters have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the verdict. Xia and the others did not appear. Presiding Judge Wu Tingqi and Judge Chen Wangliang presided over the verdict in the Third Criminal Division. The appeal was rejected. The imprisonment of Xia Changyu and Xue Qi could be commuted to a fine of three yuan per day of imprisonment, with a three-year suspended sentence.</p>
<h3>Fifty Thousand Yuan Marriage Contract, Reconciliation Fails, Hearing Rescheduled</h3>
<p>Zheng Zuoxuan, a native of Chaozhou residing at 22 Avenue du Colonel Baire, French Concession, having just reached adulthood, met Zhang Xiuying (also known as Chen Renyu), a woman from Wuxi, three years ago. On August 18th of last year, they entered into a marriage contract, setting a deadline of September 12th of the same year for the marriage. If either party breached the contract, they would have to pay fifty thousand yuan to Ms. Zhang as living expenses, signing a separate note. However, Zheng regretted this afterwards. And, since no wedding ceremony had been held, the woman hired lawyer Ma Zhenzong to file a lawsuit against Zheng in the Special Second Court for breach of contract. The initial trial ruled in favor of the woman. Zheng was not satisfied and hired lawyer Sun Zuji to appeal to the Higher Third Branch Court. Another hearing was held, and because the two sides were reconciling outside of court, they requested a postponement. Yesterday afternoon, the Higher Third Branch Court reopened the hearing. According to the lawyers representing both parties, the two sides had failed to reconcile outside of court. The court, after reviewing the statements, ordered the parties to appear in court on the afternoon of the sixth of next month for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Public Bus on Xinzha Road Kills Pedestrian</h3>
<p>At the intersection of Xinzha Road and Park Road in the International Settlement, at around 10:00 AM yesterday, two No. 10 public buses, one heading west to east and the other heading east to west, were stopping to pick up and drop off passengers, as usual. Unexpectedly, another No. 10 public bus, traveling from east to west, was speeding through the stop. A man, dressed in a blue cloth short-sleeved shirt and trousers, aged about thirty or forty, resembling a worker, carrying a shoulder pole and a net basket, was walking from west to east at that location. Unable to avoid it, he was knocked down by the bus. The wheels ran over his head, face, hands, feet, and abdomen. The police arrived and called an ambulance, which took him to Baolong Hospital. He was already barely breathing. He died without receiving medical treatment. The body has now been sent to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<h3>Flower Show Held Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Flower Show, organized by Chinese and Western flower lovers, has been managed by the Public Works Department for 62 years. Every year, a flower exhibition is held in the spring and autumn. This year's 63rd Spring Annual Meeting will be held at the Race Club on Hardoon Road, beginning at 2:00 PM today.

Tickets are one yuan for adults and fifty cents for children, including the entertainment tax. Students led by teachers will be charged only twenty cents per ticket. Most of the members of the association are European and American gentlemen. There are fewer than ten Chinese members. It is reported that Mr. Zhou Shoujuan has recently joined and has brought more than twenty potted plants and miniature landscapes made by him to be displayed at the venue. The arrangements and layouts have taken great care.</p>
<h3>Public Concession: Reconstruction of Cement Roads Currently Under Trial</h3>
<p>The roads under the jurisdiction of the Public Concession's Public Works Department (工部局), with the exception of a few small roads still paved with stone blocks, have mostly been converted to asphalt roads. However, asphalt roads tend to melt when exposed to the hot sun during the summer. Therefore, the Public Works Department has recently been experimenting with paving cement roads in various locations. Examples of already paved sections include Beijing Road (北京路), the section of Zhejiang Road (浙江路) east to Shanxi Road (山西路), where one side is cement and the other is asphalt. There are also sections where both sides are cement and the middle is still asphalt, and others where the middle is asphalt and the sides are water channels. Other roads, such as Yu Qiaqing Road (虞洽卿路) from the New Garbage Bridge (新垃圾橋) south to North Mud City Bridge (北泥城橋), are currently under trial construction.</p>

<h3>Public Men's Track and Field Meet: Nine Chinese and Western Teams Compete for the Championship; Opens Today at 2:00 PM at the American School for Boys; Thirteen Preliminary and Final Events Showcase the Skills of Chinese and Western Stars</h3>
<p>The grandest Shanghai International Track and Field Association Public Track and Field Meet (上海國際田徑協會公開田徑運動會) of this season is scheduled to open at 2:00 PM today at the American School for Boys (美童公學) on Route Petain (貝當路). Participants include nine units: Bede (培德), Portuguese (葡萄牙), Western YMCA (西靑), French Army (法陸軍), Chinese Athletic Federation (華聯), Lido (麗都), Russian Army (俄軍), School Federation (校聯), and Ma Ling (麥令). There are a total of 128 athletes. Today, three field event finals, two track event finals, six track event preliminaries, and two semifinals will be held, totaling thirteen events. The Chinese Athletic Federation has the most participants, with 27, while the Russian Army has the fewest, with only five. The Western YMCA was the champion last year, and athletes such as Mantos, Dickson, Fonseca, and Walter are still in the team. Lyokov retired, but the lineup is still neat. Ma Ling's main athlete, Finkel, is known as "the one-man track and field team" and is entered in as many as eleven events (two of which are relays), hoping to win the individual championship. Coupled with Kaufmann, Ackmann, and others, their strength should not be underestimated. The School Federation has sprint masters Edward brothers, as well as Freeman, Kuai Shittai, Rodionov, etc., who overwhelmed the Chinese Athletic Federation in a friendly match. They are formidable and may have amazing masterpieces. The two Chinese teams, the Chinese Athletic Federation and Lido, are most hopeful with Zhang Jiakui, Wu Bixian, Sun Huibei, Liu Guangfa, Wang Zhenglin, Tao Yingjie, Chen Yongfu, Guan Youwen, etc. The remaining Bede and Portuguese have mediocre strength and may not be able to achieve much. Four places are taken in each event, with points awarded as 5, 3, 2, 1. Relay points are doubled. Tickets are priced at $1.10 each (including the refugee donation). The finals for all events will be continued on June 3rd. The list of officials, the order of events, and the full list of athletes are extracted below.</p>

<h3>International Table Tennis Semifinals: Chinese Team Destroys Russian Army; Thirteen to Zero, Russians Left with Nothing</h3>
<p>The second act of the International Table Tennis Tournament (國際乒乓賽), the China Team versus the Russian Team, took place last night at the Shakour Club (沙谷爾俱樂部) on Weihaiwei Road (威海衛路) and Seymour Road (西摩路).

The Chinese generals were one step ahead and were able to control the overall situation. They will choose a date to compete with the Jewish team, which defeated the British team, to compete</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>An Overview of Secondary Normal Education in China (Part Two): Five Types of Curriculum Standards; Slight Changes in Examination Methods</h3>
<p>Funding</p>
<p>At a time when compulsory education is being actively promoted, various provinces will need a large number of short-term primary school teachers in the next few years. Therefore, simplified normal schools should occupy an important position in normal education. However, simplified normal schools are generally established by counties, while provinces mainly run normal schools. The required funding, within the provincial secondary education funding, should account for 25% according to the Regulations on the Establishment and Funding Allocation Standards for Secondary Schools in Various Provinces and Cities promulgated in 1933. It is also stipulated that the corrections should be gradually made from the 1934 academic year, reaching the standard by the end of the 1937 academic year.</p>
<p>As for the internal allocation of funds for normal schools, according to Article 20 of the revised Normal School Regulations, apart from student meals, which vary from place to place, and the methods and amounts of meal fee waivers also differ, making it inconvenient to include them, salaries should not exceed 70% at most, equipment fees should account for at least 20%, and office expenses should not exceed 10% at most. The audit method is the same as that for middle schools.</p>
<p>Curriculum</p>
<p>In 1930, the Ministry of Education promulgated the Provisional Standards for Senior High School Normal Courses, which temporarily resolved the problem of normal school curricula, which had been chaotic and without clear standards for many years. In 1932, the normal school system was revised. In September 1933, the Ministry of Education, based on the Normal School Regulations, promulgated nine types of Teaching Subjects and Weekly Teaching and Self-Study Hours Tables for various types of normal schools and normal courses. In 1934, one type of Teaching Subjects and Weekly Teaching and Self-Study Hours Table for physical education schools was formulated. In September of the same year, the Provisional Standards for Senior High School Normal Courses were revised into Normal School Curriculum Standards. In 1935, five types of curriculum standards were successively promulgated for rural normal schools, simplified normal schools, simplified rural normal schools, three-year kindergarten normal courses, and two-year kindergarten normal courses. The curriculum standards for special normal courses, simplified normal courses, and physical education normal schools have not yet been formulated. The format of each standard is the same as that of middle school curriculum standards, but the teaching subjects and hours are more than those of middle schools.</p>
<p>Equipment</p>
<p>The amount of science teaching in normal schools is less than that in middle schools, so the middle school science equipment standards are more than sufficient for normal schools. Therefore, no special equipment standards for normal schools have been formulated. It is planned to supplement them when revising the normal school curriculum standards. The supplementary of these equipment standards is also planned to be resolved together when continuing to supplement middle school equipment.</p>
<h3>Schools in This City Will Offer Preferential Treatment to Children of Soldiers</h3>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, the central government has formulated and issued regulations to various regions to provide preferential treatment to the families of soldiers fighting in the war. It is learned that these measures have been revised and re-promulgated. According to Article 7 of the regulations, families of soldiers who are fighting against the enemy and who are unable to afford the education and upbringing of their children may request assistance from the local preferential treatment committee. However, the situation in this city is more special, and many people have volunteered to join the military service in the interior. The educational community in this city has paid attention to the fact that some children are unable to attend school due to their parents' military service. If it can be proved that they are indeed the children of soldiers, they can enjoy free preferential treatment.</p>

<h3>Jiaotong University Professor Chen Rongpu Gives a Lecture on "Important Points for Applying to Jiaotong University"; This Year's Examination Period is Set for July 28</h3>
<p>Professor Chen Rongpu of Jiaotong University gave a lecture at the invitation of the private Changzhou Middle School yesterday on the content of Jiaotong University and important points for new students to pay attention to when applying. The speech was recorded by Mr. Zhang Ge Ru. The following is an excerpt of the application matters for reference by students applying to Jiaotong University this year (Editor) (above omitted). The school (i.e. Jiaotong University) will still be enrolling students during the summer vacation in mid-July of the Wooden Year [year not specified]. Registration will be from July 22 to 25, and the examination period will be from July 28 to 31. The examination subjects are the same for the Colleges of Science and Engineering, but different for the College of Management.</p>
<p>A. College of Science and Engineering: Chinese, English, History or Geography (there is also a saying that both History and Geography are tested), Physics and Chemistry, Mathematics (6 subjects in total, with Mathematics accounting for 200 points, totaling 700 points).</p>
<p>B. College of Management: Chinese, English, History and Geography, Physics or Chemistry, Outline of Economics, Bookkeeping</p>
<p>The examination time for each subject at Jiaotong University is three hours, which is the custom of the school. For all subjects except Chinese and English, answers can be written in either Chinese or English. The statistics of test scores are slightly special. If a score of one subject is less than 20 points (except for mathematics, which requires 40 points), then the average is calculated. The number of students is selected based on the height of the scores. The president and committee members will then review and determine the selection. Those with poor physical condition and those who fail the oral exam are not included in the selection. Examinees should pay close attention to this. During the oral exam, the examiners ask questions on various topics, including current events, personal life, family, and school situation. However, for those applying to the Department of Electrical Engineering, the oral exam is generally about academic questions (such as common knowledge of physics and chemistry). It is uncertain for other colleges and departments, but the answers must be calm and articulate.</p>
<p>Since last year, Jiaotong University has been recruiting new students on behalf of various national universities in the interior. The test questions are the same as those of the school. Candidates are first selected by the school and then submitted to the Ministry of Education for review and approval. It will also be held this year.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the school's test questions are complicated and difficult, which is an undeniable fact. However, this is also the special feature of the school, because it is not possible to select true talents without it. Therefore, only those with both talent and high academic achievements have hope of being admitted. This is originally for the sake of the country to think about true talents, and the experience of many years has further proved the effectiveness of this method. Although the instructions of the Ministry of Education and the requirements of the academic community do not bear to abandon this good method. However, the test questions are complicated, and difficult, but they do not exceed the scope. Those who can deeply understand and apply various disciplines can often be competent. For example, it is meaningless to adopt ordinary propositions for mathematics test questions, and it is impossible to test true talents. Special questions must be used to inspire students with talent and true understanding. It can be generally known by looking at the previous test questions of the school, and the question setters also strive to include all things with a few questions and encapsulate the essence of the book for the true talents to try to test themselves.

<h3>Where Should the Domestic Goods Industry Go?</h3>
<p>— Ma Qi</p>
<p>In recent years, the domestic goods manufacturing industry has flourished, and various factories are mostly concentrated in the Shanghai area. Since the outbreak of the August 13th War of Resistance, major factories have either been destroyed by bombs or forcibly occupied, suffering heavy blows. Old hatreds and new grievances are heart-wrenching. Patriotic individuals have either salvaged what was left and moved factories to concessions, or gone to Hong Kong, or to Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi, to re-establish new factories. Now they are thriving and sprouting new buds, and their tireless efforts are gratifying. Since the July 7th War of Resistance, North China, Central China, and East China have fallen one after another, and the sales areas of domestic goods have been seized by Japanese goods. Where should they expand to next? This is a crucial question that must be studied urgently, and how to recover the lost sales areas in the future must also be prepared in advance. Now, let's study one aspect of it:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the manufacturing aspect, there are gradually more and more domestic goods factories in the Shanghai concession area. This is mostly because they were previously located in the Chinese-controlled areas. Those that have not been occupied are salvaged from the ruins, and even a piece of wood, a piece of iron, a wheel, or an axle are regarded as treasures. If they are wiped, repaired, and fitted, they can still be used for production. Otherwise, discarding the goods on the ground would be a waste of resources. Moreover, domestic goods produced in the concessions, after being certified by domestic goods organizations, are still regarded as domestic goods by the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Finance. All goods transported to the interior are not treated as goods from the occupied areas. Therefore, domestic goods factories in the concessions have experienced abnormal development. As for those in the Hongkou area, or in Nanshi and Zhabei, where the economic and administrative rights of the factories cannot be fully maintained due to special labor conditions, they are exceptions. However, all major domestic goods industries have moved to Hong Kong and various provinces in the southwest. Under the guidance of the Ministry of Economy, new machine factories, textile factories, chemical industry factories, electrical machinery factories, silk reeling factories, hemp spinning factories, silk weaving factories, cement factories, paper mills, etc., have been successively established or are under construction in Chongqing and Zigong in Sichuan, Chenxi in Hunan, Guilin in Guangxi, and Kunming in Yunnan. Some are building factories, some are installing machines, and some have already shipped goods, all operating actively with extremely economical and rapid postures. The various raw materials in the southwest are very abundant, the labor costs are low, and the people are simple and honest. Setting up factories here is actually better than in the southeast. In the past, transporting goods from the southeast to the southwest was uneconomical in terms of time and transportation. In the future, the War of Resistance will require more abundant resources, so using local materials to manufacture goods will truly benefit the national economy and increase the firepower of the War of Resistance. As for Hong Kong, because it is a tax-free port, overlooking Southeast Asia, it is navigable everywhere. Overseas Chinese and foreign merchants gather here. Since the fall of Greater Shanghai, it has become the number one commercial port in the East. Therefore, setting up factories in the manufacturing industry here is not only convenient for transportation, but also easier to sell, and especially easy to advance towards Southeast Asia. Therefore, various domestic goods factories have also allocated their manpower and financial resources to operate everything in Hong Kong, and the factories that have been configured and established are also quite numerous.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the transportation and sales aspect, the target of domestic goods industrial products sales is of course the southwest and Southeast Asia. In recent times, the various provinces in the southwest need domestic goods very urgently. Domestic goods companies have now been established in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, and Guilin. The goods sold are still mostly transported from Shanghai. However, since the start of the war, transportation has been extremely obstructed. At first, it relied on the Yuehan Railway to Hankou, and then transported to Chongqing. Since the fall of Guangzhou, it switched to Guangzhou Bay, and traveled by highway to Chongqing. On the one hand, it still went from the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Kunming, and then divided into Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Hunan. In the future, when the Xukun Railway is completed, the transportation time from Haiphong to Sichuan will definitely be more economical. Not only will imported goods be supplied continuously, but the foreign trade of domestic goods industrial products in the southwest will also gradually increase. As for the various ports in Southeast Asia, the patriotic hearts of overseas Chinese are extraordinarily enthusiastic, and they have been eager for domestic goods to be transported there. However, they are also very repulsed by domestic goods that are disguised or of inferior quality. The inspection of domestic goods transported there is extremely strict, and no ambiguity is allowed. However, since most of the Chinese in Hong Kong are Cantonese and those who hold commercial authority are also Cantonese, those certified by the relevant Chinese General Chamber of Commerce are trusted. Therefore, setting up domestic goods factories in Hong Kong is actually more advantageous than setting them up in Shanghai, because it is easier for the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Manufacturers' Association to inspect nearby and easily complete the certification procedures. As for the Chinese in Hong Kong, they had little understanding of domestic goods in the past due to environmental factors, but recently, due to their eagerness to be patriotic, they are all happy to use domestic goods. Therefore, newly established domestic goods companies in Hong Kong have also been very successful in their business.</p>
<p>The commerce of North China, Central China, and East China is currently dominated by Japanese goods due to military relations. Therefore, the recovery of the sales areas of domestic goods industries will have to wait until the Chinese army recovers the lost territories. However, domestic goods industries are related to the prosperity and decline of the entire national economy, so they must seek other ways to expand. The southwestern provinces were once remote, but now they have become the center of China's military, political, and economic affairs. Moreover, the raw materials are abundant, and the people are diligent. It is most appropriate to develop factories here. The manufactured goods can be transported abroad to obtain foreign exchange, which will enrich the vitality of the long-term war of resistance. Southeast Asia is close to the road, the people are rich, and the overseas Chinese are very patriotic. Transporting domestic goods there will definitely be easier to sell. Recently, the Bank of Communications and various commercial banks have successively established branches in Singapore, Batavia, Manila, and other places, which will provide more economic assistance for the transportation of domestic goods industrial products to Southeast Asia. Financial turnover will be more effective with less effort. However, one thing that domestic goods industries must pay attention to is that the products must meet the domestic goods standards stipulated by the Ministry of Economy, otherwise they will not be welcomed by overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. As for the domestic goods industries in the Shanghai concession, although they are temporarily thriving and experiencing abnormal development, they are ultimately not a happy land in this environment. It is hoped that patriotic people will not be greedy for short-term gains, nor seek temporary peace, but will invigorate their spirits and develop in the southwest and Southeast Asia to wait for the opportunity to change. The wheel of opportunity has now begun, and the goal of reaching it is not far away. The knowledgeable people probably will not wait and see, right?</p>
<h3>Shanghai Construction Before the War (5)</h3>
<p>— Lin Lang</p>
<p>Pudong Water Plant: The area along the river in Pudong, shaped like a narrow rectangle, was originally the location of foreign merchants' wharves and warehouses. In recent years, factories have sprung up and the population has become dense. The lack of a water supply system has made obtaining water difficult, which is a major drawback in the municipal administration. In October of the 23rd year of the Republic of China [1934], the municipal government ordered the Municipal Industrial Trust to prepare for the construction of a water plant in Pudong. The trust selected the Long Wharf across the Huangpu River from the Bund on Nanjing Road as the site for the water plant and ordered pipes and other materials from the German Deshaw Siemens company. Water production began in the summer of the 26th year of the Republic of China [1937]. The water quality was pure and clean, and the pressure was sufficient, which was a great success. The base area of the Pudong Water Plant is approximately 7.04 mu. The length of the water pipes, referring to the main pipes with a diameter of 100 mm or more, is approximately 11,000 meters. There are 45 fire hydrants. The main water production equipment is as follows: one inlet pipe with an inner diameter of 500 mm; two raw water pumps, fully electric centrifugal type. The water output of the No. 1 pump is 406.8 cubic meters per hour; the No. 2 pump is 673.2 cubic meters, totaling 1,080 cubic meters. Two coagulation and sedimentation tanks, with a total capacity of approximately 2,175 cubic meters. One aerator. Two clear water tanks, with a total capacity of approximately 3,650 cubic meters. Two clear water pumps, fully electric centrifugal type, with a water output of 360 cubic meters per hour for the No. 1 pump; 561.6 cubic meters for the No. 2 pump, totaling 921 cubic meters. One outlet pipe with an inner diameter of 500 mm.</p>
<p>Municipal Ferry: The transportation across the Huangpu River in Shanghai has long relied on old-fashioned ferries, which were not only slow but also dangerous. Since the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government in the 16th year of the Republic of China [1927], attention has been paid to the transportation problem between the east and west banks of the Huangpu River. At that time, the ferry was transferred along with the Bund Construction Bureau and was temporarily managed by the Pudong Office of the Municipal Government. In December of the same year, the office was abolished, and the Public Works Bureau and the Finance Bureau jointly took over the management, establishing the Pudong Ferry Administration Bureau. In July of the following year, to unify authority, the original business portion of the Finance Bureau was also transferred to the Public Works Bureau for management, and the Pudong Ferry Administration Office was renamed the Huangpu River Ferry Administration Office. At the end of the 19th year of the Republic of China [1930], the Public Works Bureau changed it to the Ferry General Administration Office in accordance with the detailed rules. In August of the 22nd year of the Republic of China [1933], the Shanghai Industrial Trust was established and took over the Shanghai Municipal Ferry business, renaming it the Shanghai Municipal Ferry Administration Office. The ferries operated by the office are divided into long-distance ferries and cross-river ferries. (1) Long-distance ferry - Shanghai-Wusong Line, directly from Shanghai to Wusong. The important developments are as follows: In the 18th year of the Republic of China [1929], the Donggou Wharf was built. New-style ferry boats Nos. 1 and 2 were ordered, marking the beginning of Shanghai's self-built new-style ferry boats. A 40-ton diesel pool was built at the Donggou Wharf. In the 19th year of the Republic of China [1930], ferry boats Nos. 3 and 4 were added. In the 20th year of the Republic of China [1931], the Qingning Temple and Gaoqiao floating wharves were built, extending the route to Gaoqiao. Due to the increase in fuel consumption after the addition of ferry boats, another 550-ton diesel pool was added. In the 21st year of the Republic of China [1932], special and joint Gaoqiao services to Songhu began. The building of the General Administration Office was also built in this year. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China [1933], the Xidu Wharf and ferry No. 5 were built. In the 23rd year of the Republic of China [1934], the ferry was extended to Wusong. In the 24th year of the Republic of China [1935], the Beijing Road Wharf was built, and ferry No. 6 was added. (2) Cross-river ferry, divided into: Qingding Line, from Beijing Road Wharf to Qingning Temple in Pudong, every twenty minutes back and forth. The Wei Line, traveling between Qichang Wharf in Pudong and Weisaigong Wharf in Puxi. The Dongdong Line, from Dongmen Road (Sixteen Puxu) in Puxi to Dongchang Road in Pudong. The Chunbei Line, from Beijing Road Wharf to Chunjiang Wharf across the river. The Tangdong Line, from Dongjiadu to the intersection of Tangqiao Road. The sideline businesses operated by the Municipal Ferry Administration Office are as follows: (1) Gaoqiao Bus, started in the spring of the 20th year of the Republic of China [1931], and extended to the Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach in the 22nd year of the Republic of China [1933]. (2) Floating Restaurant, on the upper floor of the Beijing Road Wharf, with clean facilities and beautiful scenery. (3) Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach, using the sandy beach of Gaoqiao Seaside, was opened as a bathing beach, which is a summer resort. (4) Sending off passengers from seagoing vessels, started in the 24th year of the Republic of China [1935], contracted with major shipping companies to handle the business of sending off visitors. (5) Cool Evening Service and Boat Rentals. Started in the 20th year of the Republic of China [1931], using decommissioned ships as a place to cool off on the river. Overall, since the Municipal Industrial Trust took over the Municipal Ferry, the expansion of routes, the opening of wharves, and the addition of ferries have all progressed year by year. It stands out in the various constructions of Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Dog Administration in the Shanghai International Settlement (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Chen Bintang</p>
<p>(B) Paralytic Rabies - Dogs suffering from this disease become weaker day by day, their hind legs become paralyzed, their jaws droop, saliva drools from their mouths, and the muscles in their throats also become paralyzed. This is often mistaken for a bone stuck in the throat, so dog owners often search for the location of the bone, the danger of which can be imagined.</p>
<p>Some say that dogs suffering from rabies are mostly afraid of water, but we must never take this as a sign, because some rabid dogs may be extremely thirsty and drink wildly.</p>
<p>Incubation Period of Rabies: The so-called incubation period is the time from when a person or dog contracts rabies to when the first symptoms appear. This period is often indefinite, either very short or extended to six months or more. The development of this disease usually takes a long time, causing dog owners to disbelieve it. Little do they know that the dog may have been bitten or infected for other reasons months ago.</p>
<p>Appropriate Measures After Discovering a Livestock Animal Suffering From Rabies: When a dog suffers from fever or other diseases, or the above-mentioned initial phenomena occur, the solution is to immediately isolate the dog or send it to a hospital for diagnosis and treatment. By doing so, even if rabies is not discovered, it can prevent serious illness. If the illness is already severe, it can also avoid the occurrence of complex changes. Sometimes, livestock suffering from rabies die in secluded places three to six days later. Therefore, if a sick livestock animal is found to be missing, it is suspicious and the method should be requested from the Health Department of the Public Works Bureau, or the suspicious livestock can be sent to the veterinarian for examination, or reported to the nearest police station for free transfer to the Dog Inspection Office of the Health Department for inspection.</p>
<p>Measures After Being Bitten by a Dog: (A) Ineffectiveness of Household Disinfectants - Viscous ointments, resins, or household disinfectants are all ineffective. Other substances such as lysol, iodine, and silver nitrate have all been tested and have little effect.</p>
<p>(B) Temporary First Aid - The wound can first be washed with a solution of Chloramine T, and then cauterized with nitric acid. Although this method is drastic and unpleasant, it is a necessary treatment and must be performed by a doctor. (Note: Chloramine T is a type of tablet sold in all pharmacies. It is very convenient for emergency use and is sometimes very effective. Dog owners should store this antiseptic at home and use it immediately after being bitten. This can help when performing cauterization and add an extra layer of protection).</p>
<p>(C) Go to a doctor or the Health Department of the Public Works Bureau immediately to receive Pasteur Treatment. The treatment period is 20 days. If you have not been bitten by a rabid animal but have been licked by the saliva of a rabid animal, then 15 days is sufficient. One injection is given every day. Residents of the Public Works Bureau in the Shanghai International Settlement can receive free treatment; if they are not residents of the Settlement, they must pay for treatment according to the following regulations: 24 days (24 injections): 70 yuan in legal tender; 15 days (15 injections): 30 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<p>(D) Identify the animal that bit the person and report it to the nearest police station to send the animal for inspection or to a reliable veterinarian for examination, but do not kill it. If it is killed, it must be waited at least fourteen days before it can be determined whether it has rabies, and the person who was bitten may have to undergo the Pasteur treatment unnecessarily; if the animal is captured alive, it can be discovered within a few days whether it has rabies or not.</p>
<h3>Things Dog Owners Should Know</h3>
<p>After reviewing the above, dog owners should know the following:</p>
<p>1. Gloves must be kept near the dog house.</p>
<p>2. Gloves must be worn when giving medicine to the dog or touching its mouth.</p>
<p>3. When playing with the dog, be careful not to let it injure your hands and avoid being licked by the dog.</p>
<p>4. Pay attention to the dog's health.</p>
<p>5. Pay attention to the dog's training. If the dog you keep is prone to biting pedestrians, consider the terrible consequences of being bitten. Dog owners who fail to do this lack public morality, to say the least.</p>
<p>Various Precautions Against Rabies: Avoid any dog that is not wearing a muzzle, or stray dogs, and keep away from dogs running around. Pay special attention to the health of your beloved livestock animals, and wear gloves when handling sick livestock animals. Finally, for the purpose of preventing rabies, the best method is preventive vaccination. This has been tested and proven effective in Japan. Dog owners should have their dogs vaccinated once a year. This type of vaccination is not only effective in prevention, but also completely safe.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The dog administration in the Shanghai International Settlement can be said to be very good. The required licenses are also common in various countries, and the capture of ownerless stray dogs is in fact because these dogs are not cared for and often carry rabies. Therefore, the Public Works Bureau has no choice but to do this. As for excellent breeds of dogs, the police station will find a new owner for them. With the establishment of the Shanghai Society for the Protection of Animals, it can be said that dogs in the Settlement have been treated extremely well. This year, the population of this city has increased more than it has in decades, and the number of people receiving rabies treatment from the Health Department of the Public Works Bureau has greatly decreased. This is because Shanghai has become an isolated island, with European and American troops deployed all around. Dogs wandering outside the Settlement cannot enter, so the number of rabies cases has naturally decreased. This clearly shows that ownerless stray dogs should be eliminated immediately, otherwise rabies in the Settlement will never be eradicated.</p>

<h3>Methods for Sexual Health After Indulging in Sensual Pleasures and Depleting Excessive Essence</h3>
<p>— Yang Daonan, Graduate of Russian Labor University Medical School</p>
<p>Seeking pleasure and flirting with women is a common problem among young people. This is because young people are inexperienced in the world and their wills are not firm. If they indulge slightly, they will become addicted to excess. Although this can still lead to weakness and decline for playboys who are carefree and have nothing to do, their relatively superior living environment means that the harm is delayed compared to ordinary young people who work hard with their minds and bodies. This is because a person's energy cannot be consumed in many ways. It is common to see young shop assistants in stores who, once they indulge in sensual pleasures, are exhausted from working during the day, and their energy declines faster. If this is coupled with insufficient nutrition or even insufficient sleep, the result is only accelerated death. Therefore, young people in schools and shop assistants who are tempted by obscene books and paintings and become addicted to masturbation often show terrible physical and mental symptoms that cannot support long-term decline. In a short period of time, they will show problems such as seminal emission, premature ejaculation, mental weakness, insomnia, incomplete development, pale complexion, and loss of appetite. Even if they abstain from lewd thoughts later, they ejaculate earlier than normal people when engaging in normal married life. Patients themselves are very painful. To compensate for this deficiency, the only solution is to seek methods to enhance sexual power. People with weak medical knowledge are deceived by the aphrodisiac advertisements of unethical drug dealers and fall into an abyss from which they cannot escape, and their lifelong happiness is lost. Therefore, treating sexual dysfunction with aphrodisiacs is like drinking poison to quench thirst, and regret is hard to undo!</p>
<p>Therefore, the most important thing in treating this condition is to restore the person's health and increase the blood produced physiologically, so that the essence and blood depleted by indulging in sensual pleasures can be quickly restored. Among the various endocrine agents recently discovered on the market, the only internal medicine that can satisfy our doctors is "Testo-compren," an animal essence preparation for men invented by the German physiologist Dr. Mehrun. When I was a specialist in kidney diseases and practiced at the Lenin Medical College in Russia, I gave various glandular preparations to 145 patients with the same disease, with the intention of determining which drug had a superior curative effect to other drugs. After three weeks, the degree of increase in sexual power in most of the above-mentioned patients was extremely weak, while the group treated with "Testo-compren" showed an average increase in essence and blood, calculated at 2 and one-quarter percent per day. In other words, "Testo-compren" has been proven to be nearly 20 times superior to the blood-tonifying and essence-producing ingredients contained in ordinary tonics, and nearly 10 and a half times superior to similar glandular preparations. May I ask what other preparation on the market can meet the treatment standards of our doctors?</p>
<p>"Testo-compren" is divided into two types, male and female. The male type has the functions of tonifying the brain, tonifying the blood, tonifying the essence, and tonifying the kidneys. In addition to tonifying the brain and blood, the female type also has the effect of regulating menstruation and promoting fertility. It is widely used in gynecology.</p>
<p>Modern Medicine</p>
<h3>A True Account of Treating Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Cure for Cystitis</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Yan Chuanshi, from Ningbo, lives on Xin Zha Road. He recently contracted gonorrhea. Due to improper treatment, it suddenly turned into cystitis. He had difficulty urinating and was always in pain from not being able to urinate completely. His lower abdomen was sore and swollen, and his urine was turbid. He also had nocturnal emissions at night, and his semen was mixed with pus and blood. He was about to develop seminal vesiculitis. He urgently sought my treatment. In addition to washing his bladder, I also instructed him to purchase and take "Clinon," the latest special medicine for gonorrhea invented by the German Dr. Peter, to kill the gonococci and promote the dissipation of inflammation, so that urination would be smooth and urine would be clear, and the pain of nocturnal emissions would stop. After taking about four bottles, he was completely cured. Later, I received a letter from Mr. Yan saying that after returning to his hometown, he had another serum test at the local hospital, and there was no venereal reaction. This proved that he was completely cured and his body had completely recovered to health. My wife's gonorrhea was also cured after she took "Clinon" introduced by your doctor, and externally used "Carder Shudi Vaginal Tablets" as a suppository, which she used every night before going to bed as directed. After three weeks, she was also completely cured. The couple is deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Weak Body and White Turbidity</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Xiao Shiwen, living on Bailbu Road, 26 years old, unmarried. He suffered from masturbation in his early years and later contracted gonorrhea. As a result, his body was weak and the disease became more difficult to cure. His testicles ached, his urination was short, and he saw blood after urination. He also suffered from nocturnal emissions, insomnia, dizziness, and other symptoms. His spirit and body were haggard. Later, he sought my treatment. My diagnosis was that he had a weak body and posterior urethritis. I immediately prescribed "Clinon" to kill the long-standing gonococci, so that the scope of inflammation would continue to shrink, so that gonococci could be eradicated. At the same time, I also ordered him to purchase and take "Testo-compren" to treat his insomnia, strengthen his body, and stop his nocturnal emissions. He was completely cured within four weeks.</p>
<h3>The Importance of Mental Comfort in Lung Disease</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of lung disease, the only sure and effective methods are taking medicine and resting quietly. At this time, even walking a very short distance is not advisable for the patient, so it is not an exaggeration to lie quietly in bed all day. At the same time, it is advisable to be calm and at ease, and not to fall into despair and pessimistic thoughts. This disease has a great influence on the mental state. Family members or friends should give comfort in every way, or seek self-comfort in religion. Those who can be mentally happy will receive great benefits in treatment.</p>
<p>In addition, for internal medicine, the most important thing is to seek medicines that can stop coughs, dissolve phlegm, and kill tuberculosis. Among the lung disease medicines on the market with this efficacy, the first to be recommended is the German "Pulmonal." As a specialist in lung diseases, I have learned from 30 years of experience that "Pulmonal" is indeed a special medicine for treating tuberculosis and I am especially recording it here.</p>
<h3>Never Use Temporary Treatments for Seminal Emission</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Seminal emission, whether suffered before marriage or after marriage, has different drawbacks. Those who discover it before marriage are more likely to hinder development. If young people aged sixteen or seventeen have too frequent seminal emissions, the development of their reproductive organs will definitely be difficult to grow. Those who suffer after marriage are more worrying, because according to general reasoning, minor symptoms of seminal emission can be reduced or even not discovered after marriage. However, if there are still seminal emissions, the degree of kidney deficiency and weakness can be imagined. If this kind of person does not try hard to treat it, not only will the neurasthenia become deeper and deeper, but also premature ejaculation and impotence will be worrying for descendants. Life has no happiness at all. To make up for this shortcoming, there is a need to engage in symptomatic treatment.</p>
<p>In society, there are so-called "essence-consolidating pills," but they are actually just inferior medicines that are only effective for a short time (?), which can only treat seminal emission temporarily and have many drawbacks, harming digestive function. As a specialist in venereal diseases, I have many years of experience in the treatment of seminal emission, and the one with sure efficacy is the French special medicine for seminal emission "Nires Seminal Emission Pills." If you also take the testicular essence preparation for men "Testo-compren" to supplement losses, it will be more effective and can replenish essence and blood, returning to youth.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Forum</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>— Described by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>……… What methods should be used to remedy the loss of fertility in both men and women due to gonorrhea?</p>
<p>……… Abandon general unscientific treatments and maintain hygiene and use special treatments!</p>
<p>The seminal vesicle is the place where sperm is stored and can be called the main element of reproduction. If gonococci invade this place, the pure sperm will be disturbed by them, and it is especially easy to infect women, causing uterine gonorrhea or oophoritis, salpingitis, etc. This symptom is especially easy to find in acute seminal vesiculitis. Patients often have a feeling of foreign body pressure and pain in the rectum or perineum, as well as painful frequent urination and pain during ejaculation. There may also be itching and a feeling of pleasure in the urethra due to the continued erection of the penis. At this time, the ejaculation is more painful, and the semen that is ejaculated is mixed with blood. Occasionally, there is also fever, and in severe cases, a state of depression or excitement. Therefore, patients with gonorrhea often fall into a dilemma.</p>
<p>Patients do not find the formation of this symptom terrifying in my clinical observation. It is precisely an easy period to cure. However, if the treatment method is incorrect, or the patient delays the treatment himself, it will instead lead to a difficult situation. In my clinical experience of more than 20 years, patients with acute gonorrhea seminal vesiculitis are instructed to be absolutely quiet, and German static electricity therapy is used to directly attack the gonococci in the seminal vesicle, and the internal medicine "Clinon" is used to exert its anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect to kill them. Therefore, after taking it, all inflammation can be completely dissipated within 12 hours. Within a week, this difficult and incurable acute seminal vesiculitis is completely and radically resolved, completely cured, never recurring, and fertility is restored. Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 appointments are sent out every day, with each appointment costing only 5 cents.</p>

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: The Expansion of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry is Too Far, Production and Consumption are Incompatible, Gradually Forming a Phenomenon of Heavy Capital, Light Profit, and Full Inventory</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Recently, the sales of cotton cloth have been either prosperous or declining, and the changes are too rapid, making it difficult for people to feel at ease. Although there are one or two customer groups purchasing, from an overall point of view, the output is increasing day by day, and the demand is decreasing day by day. In recent years, the Shanghai textile and dyeing industry has been very profitable, attracting huge amounts of floating capital. Dyeing and weaving factories are easy to set up, and the most have been established. The phenomenon of profitable factories using profits to supplement the capital for renewed production is especially common. However, sales are turning downward due to complex factors such as military affairs and economic policies. Therefore, the most recent preliminary phenomenon is the widespread reduction of profits, the increase in raw material prices, and the very weak upward stimulation force. At the same time, inventories are becoming increasingly full.</p>
<p>Yesterday, cloth prices were hit by the price drop of Cambodian piece goods, and the situation declined slightly. The sales discs of various goods were chaotic, and the price drops were uneven. The white goods, Yihua coarse cloth factory discs were high, about one yuan higher per piece than the market. Hand goods were once tight. Yesterday, the market wanted to rise but had no strength and still opened at the original disc. The Zhejiang and Anhui gangs absorbed more than one hundred packages of light and heavy weight grades. The demand for fine cloth and fine twill turned quiet. The Zhejiang and Guangdong gangs purchased small amounts of various brands of three or four pieces per item. The factory opened for sale and the orders were rare. The current sales of the bleached cloth and printed cloth for the main bleaching and dyeing cloth are mainly to the local gang in the street, with the Guangdong and Zhejiang gangs being more prosperous. The Shantou gang wholesale purchased four to five thousand pieces. The Wenzhou transshipment of light-colored cloths such as Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, government silk, bleached cloth, and printed cloth continued to purchase two thousand several hundred pieces yesterday.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the white goods market was sluggish, and the downward trend became more severe. The smallest dragon head fine cloth dropped to 13.10 yuan, and the market recovered slightly later. Although there were differences in the shouting discs, the situation was still good at the close of the market, at 13.15 yuan. Futures were 13.35 yuan. Customer sales were still extremely rare. Only the fellow traders in the market bought and sold nearly a thousand pieces of fine cloth and fine twill. However, according to actual sales, it was mediocre. Therefore, the general scattered households feel that the current market is still not stable.</p>
<p>Export</p>
<p>Today, there are seventy-five pieces of cloth being shipped to Tianjin, and ten pieces being shipped to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Sale of Paradise Fabric Reaches 2,000 Yards Daily —Significant Price Increase—</h3>
<p>The actual sales of Paradise fabric are expanding, with sales in stores averaging over 2,000 yards daily. This demonstrates the current high demand. However, an examination of sales shows that 70-80% is for Chinese-style clothing, while demand for Western-style clothing continues to decrease. Due to strong sales, the market is experiencing supply shortages, and prices are gradually rising. The Lixing brand has increased significantly due to its fine quality and suitability for sales. The 200 crates of Paradise fabric detained in Hong Kong have still not been shipped to Shanghai, leading to domestic Paradise fabric from factories like Hongshengyinfeng being completely sold out. There is also mutual buying and selling of artificial wool. Yesterday, Hehe Kongpan was sold at a risen price of $4.55, Hongsheng single width at $2.35, artificial wool at $3.80, Yiji Sida at $4.10, Yongxingshen weave at $4.40, and Yin at $4.25 to $4.50.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Fujian and Hong Kong Buyers Focus on Single and Double-Strand Yarn, Da Fa Chong Xin Mill Offers 700 Bales of 20-Count Yarn</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market remains largely stagnant, fluctuating within a range of two to three dollars throughout the day. In terms of actual demand, the Fujian and Hong Kong buyers continue their unwavering procurement, while other regions show little interest. As a result, cotton yarn prices remain unusually stable. Market transactions show that the purchase of 32-count single-strand yarn is exceptionally strong, followed by 42-count double-strand yarn. Shantou buyers are particularly keen on acquiring 32-count single-strand yarn, purchasing all available spot goods in the market, and pre-ordering the spot goods for the next two or three weeks. In the past, this group had no transactions for single-strand yarn, but recently they have changed their focus to buying it. The reason given is that transportation on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is blocked, and goods from Hunan, Jiangxi, and other places are being transported through Shantou. This has led to a sudden surge in sales for this group.</p>
<p>Regarding the current yarn situation, the market opening was said to be average. Industry insiders discussed the severe bombing in Chongqing, Sichuan, which has dampened consumer sentiment, so opening prices were similar to the previous day. The spot price for 20-count Shuang Ma was $427.50. Suddenly, buying momentum increased, and brokers’ buy calls rose sharply, pushing the price up by three dollars. Spot goods from foreign firms reached $430.05. It was widely reported that the packing machine at the Shenxin No. 9 mill was damaged and unable to pack, and yarn tickets were not being issued, leading to increased buying. By the closing bell, the price had fallen back slightly by one or two dollars, with Shuang Ma priced at $428.50 and warehouse receipts at $421.50. The afternoon opening was peaceful, but then a certain yarn brand bought 200-300 bales of Shuang Ma and Shuang Diqiu, reinvigorating the market and pushing the price back up by two dollars. The closing price for spot Shuang Ma was $430, and the price for warehouse receipts was $422.50. Total purchases by all groups for the day were 1,510 bales. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma rose by $2.50, Tejincheng by $3, Shuang Diqiu by $2.50, Muyang remained unchanged, while 32-count Tiannv Shuang Ma single-strand yarn rose by about $8. Chongxin Mill offered 700 bales of 20-count Da Fa yarn at a price of $395, for delivery in cash from June to August. Today, 160 bales of cotton yarn are being shipped to Tianjin and 20 bales to Yantai. The purchase quantities by various groups are listed below: Same Industry: 860, Inland: 75, Shantou: 155,</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 420, Total: 1,510</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market was very expensive at the start of the morning, because the end of the current month was approaching and speculative short sellers were rushing to cover, so the futures prices were strong. The price for the current month was $363, but actual demand was weak. In the afternoon, prices weakened again, and the closing price was $361, an increase of $2 compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Export Subsidies: Not Yet Hopeless, Trading of Domestic and Foreign Cotton Stalled</h3>
<p>In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market was active from the start of the morning. Telegrams from Bombay and Liverpool reported price increases, attracting new buyers. Although some long positions were later taken off the table for profit, the market was not affected. Developments in Washington were positive, and general fears about export subsidies gradually diminished. The continuous rise in US cotton prices is due to the indefinite postponement of the release of loan cotton, resulting in a severe shortage of spot goods in the market. However, the issue of export subsidies is not yet hopeless. Yesterday, New York rose by 6-7 points, while Indian cotton and forecasts remained unchanged. Egyptian cotton remained unchanged. Converted to legal currency, all other cottons remained unchanged except for US cotton and Brazilian cotton, which both rose by 80 cents.</p>
<p>The trade of foreign cotton in Shanghai was very quiet. All attention was focused on inspecting cotton samples from recent arrivals. There were no reports of transactions between industry players. The delivered price of cotton in Shanghai, converted to factory price, is listed below:</p>
<p>The domestic cotton business remained sluggish, with no signs of development. Inventories were dwindling. Although factories were interested in buying, prices were either extremely high or the quality of the cotton was too poor, leading to stalled transactions. Foreign cotton transactions were intermittent. Supply from Northern Jiangsu was scarce, and heavy exploitation during transport made it difficult for traders to profit. This was widely seen as a dangerous path to be avoided like wolves and tigers. Arrivals at the docks included 130 bales of white cotton and 653 bales of wooden frames, plus 170 pieces from Beisha. The current cotton situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Rangoon Cotton PBF $73.00 East Cotton, Entering: 300 pieces, Cash, Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton $68.50 Wan Cotton, Number Entering: 190 bales, Another</p>
<p>Lower Sand Cotton $70.50 Same Industry, Medium Entering: 20 bales, Telegraphic Transfer, Warehouse Delivery</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Prices in Japan and the US Continue to Rise, French Firms Actively Buy White Filature Silk</h3>
<p>Overseas silk markets continued to rise yesterday. Trading in the New York market for the current month has stopped. The near-term July contract rose nine points, the September contract rose three points, and the far-term December contract opened at $2.28. Market sentiment was enthusiastic, with 2,500 dan of silk traded throughout the day. Spot silk prices were stable yesterday, with no change for Chinese and Japanese raw silk. Yokohama spot prices were $1,308, up $3, and forward prices were up $7. However, according to Yokohama phone reports, although silk prices in the Tokyo market are rising, actual sales are very weak.</p>
<p>Silk sales in Shanghai were brisk, but unfortunately, the US market did not respond in kind. As a result, only French firms were active yesterday, with White Filature 7-star grades 13-15 selling for $2,025, with potential for further price increases. XB grade was priced at $1,840, up $20. French firms such as Yanghang Xinfu, Shichang, and Shufeng purchased a total of 150 dan. By the afternoon, it was rumored that 7-8% of White Filature silk for US sales had been sold at a new high price of $1,890. However, this price seemed unlikely at the time, or may have been an English inspection deal. This point still needs to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 75 pieces of tea arrived from Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Finance: Gold Market Quiet, Outflows but No Inflows in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday’s cash "heating red" (short term loan) grey market conditions were very dull, trading was stagnant, and there was a lack of interest. Most operators took a wait-and-see attitude. In the morning, the market opened at $2,115, raised by security firms who suddenly stopped blocking inflows. Afterwards, it weakened due to sales by retail investors, resulting in a net increase of only $1. Trading was very quiet, with only about 200 taels traded in the morning. In the afternoon, it was rumored that there were sellers but no buyers at $2,112, and no transactions were heard of. Gold jewelry remained unchanged. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold rebounded uniformly.</p>
<p>"Heating Red" Increased by One Dollar</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) was quite silent, with no transactions for a long time. It was not until 10:20 AM that securities firms advanced 50 taels each of cash number and money exchange companies, each at an opening price of $2,115, which was $3 higher than the previous closing. After the opening, a money exchange company advanced 50 taels of cash number, at the same price as the morning opening. Subsequently, a cash number sold 10 taels to a new peer jewelry store, the price also rising by $5. There were sellers but no buyers at that time, the market slightly softening. After 11:15 AM, money exchange companies were again seen selling 50 taels to gold shops, at a price of $13. After this, there were no transactions until noon, so the noon closing was still at $13. In the afternoon, the market was exceptionally quiet, but the market continued to be flat and tired. Sellers called for $2,112, but buyers only offered $10. Both sides held their ground. After 4 PM, there were no transactions, so the last transaction price in the morning, $2,113, was used, which was a net increase of $1 compared to the closing the previous night. The "heating red" of Cash Number ranged only $2 high and low throughout the half day. The selling price of the original Cash Number brand was $2,115, and the buyback price was $2,105. The current standard gold price was about $50 lower than the listed gold price, but there were only offers and no market.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Unchanged</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in jewelry stores remained unchanged. Datonghang still listed $215, while Xintonghang listed $213, with a buyback price of $207.</p>
<p>British Pure Gold Rebounded</p>
<p>London, 25th, electricity: British pure gold rebounded by half a penny per ounce due to the weakening of the pound sterling, reaching £7 8s 5½d. The Bank of China's cash purchase price also rebounded to $1,211.9, and the listed Customs gold also rose by two li, amounting to $2.396. The Shanghai standard gold price also rose by 30 cents, amounting to $1,207.2.</p>
<h3>Depressed Foreign Exchange Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market remained depressed. Spot exchange rates for both British and US currencies were stagnant. Only oil companies such as Texaco and other foreign companies had to settle accounts at the end of the month. However, foreign banks were still willing to supply funds, so the situation remained stable. Trading was very quiet due to the absence of Chinese and Western speculators. The Hong Kong exchange rate was also stagnant due to a balance between supply and demand, resulting in a flat outcome.</p>
<p>At the start of the morning, the London major contracts were down by 0.0625, the New York silver price was fixed, the London raw gold price was up by half a penny, the exchange rate for British pounds against US dollars was down by six mills, the rate against Shanghai and France was flat. The US dollar fell by 0.0625 against the British pound, remained flat against Shanghai, and fell by 0.0625 against France. The central bank's listed prices for Shanghai remained unchanged. At the bank's morning opening, the spot selling price for British exchange was 8.025 pence, and for US dollars to Shanghai, it was $16.0625, both unchanged from the previous closing. After the opening, foreign companies first closed out favorable spot British gold at 8.025 pence. Subsequently, the oil company Texaco also purchased spot US exchange from an affiliate of Anda Bank at $16.0625, and also purchased July US exchange at $15.9375. Because supply and demand were balanced, there were few fluctuations. When the HSBC listing was announced unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was announced down by 2.5%, assessed at 5.00%, foreign companies then purchased July British gold from the Dutch Huabi at 8.01875 pence. The situation remained stable. After that, the market became increasingly quiet, and prices changed little. Near noon, foreign bank Huayi sold spot Hong Kong exchange to a money exchange company at $55.125. The market was also very stable. At noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices for both British and US exchange were unchanged from the morning opening, with the Hong Kong exchange still at $55.125.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, foreign companies continued to close out spot British gold at 8.025 pence, and also purchased spot US exchange from a certain bank at $16.0625. Later, foreign companies came to absorb July British gold from Huabi at 8.01875 pence. At that time, Hong Kong telegrams suddenly offered July US exchange to an affiliate of Youli Bank at $15.9375, so the process was extremely stable. Later, money exchange companies came to absorb spot Hong Kong exchange from foreign banks at $55.125. There were also few changes in the market. At the evening closing, the bank's spot selling prices were British exchange at 8.025 pence, US exchange at $16.0625, and Hong Kong exchange at $55.125. As a result, there were no gains or losses compared to the previous night's closing.</p>
<h3>Further Increase in Japanese Currency, Momentum Forming a Holding Pattern</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold rose by half a penny, and the exchange rate fell by 0.0625. Foreign exchange in Shanghai was in high demand from foreign companies settling accounts. Companies like Meifu and Texaco were absorbing significant amounts, fortunately, foreign banks provided ample supply and the market price was stable and unchanged. The cash 'heating red' opening saw gold shops absorbing actively, and the market was strong and elegant. Later, money exchange companies provided a more fluid supply, and the market price decreased slightly. The price fluctuation was narrow and tended to form a holding pattern. No transactions occurred in the afternoon session, and the result was a slight increase of one dollar compared to the previous day. Foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, were being absorbed by customers, were being purchased, and the prices rose. The British and American gold notes had active trade, with a balance of supply and demand, but the American gold notes were slightly weak. The Hong Kong and French franc notes were not actively traded and were relatively stable. Singapore and Philippine notes had some supply, and the prices fluctuated slightly. There was some Italian currency trading, and it was slightly firm and expensive. The Japanese gold notes initially traded at 94.5 cents, and the Korean notes at 84 cents. The market then weakened, with the Japanese gold notes falling to 94 cents and the Korean notes to 83.5 cents. The afternoon market prices rebounded, with the Japanese gold notes at 94.7, and the Korean notes at 84 cents. There was no major supply in the market, and the sporadic demand was very high. The Japanese gold notes closed at 95.2, and the Korean notes at 84.2. The market trended toward consolidation. No trades were made in the association. The market prices yesterday showed a 15-cent increase for British gold pounds, a 30-cent increase for American gold pounds, a 1 mill decrease for American gold notes, and a 5 mill decrease for Singapore and Philippine notes. Italian notes increased by 3 mills, and all other currencies remained unchanged.</p>

<h3>Securities: Kai Ping Stock and English-Shanghai Stocks Still Reported Gains—The Domestic and Foreign Debt Markets Were Quiet</h3>
<p>The securities grey market was very sluggish yesterday. Prices fluctuated between five cents and one dime. Both the long and short sides held their ground. Buyers were unwilling to increase prices, and sellers were unwilling to decrease prices. This deadlock could only be broken by external factors. Both morning and afternoon trading sessions were extremely quiet and sluggish. The Datongkang and Tongshun bought, but only increased by five cents or one dime. Zhongyi supplied more, so the afternoon closing saw only a slight improvement of one dime for Type B, while the rest showed no change. Although the afternoon seemed slightly firmer, most were watching. Trading volume decreased. Hengfu, Tiansheng, and Xingyuan all saw some selling, while Tongshun and the Number 20 had a slightly better appetite, but only to a limited extent. The rest was just piecemeal trading by retail investors. As a result, three types improved slightly by five cents or one dime, while the remaining two showed no change. The total volume traded was around $500,000. A summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>Type A | 61.70 | 61.55 | 61.60 | Flat</p>
<p>Type B | 54.25 | 54.30 | 54.30 | Up 0.10</p>
<p>Type C | 52.65 | 52.45 | 52.50 | Flat</p>
<p>Type D | 52.25 | 52.15 | 52.20 | Up 0.05</p>
<p>Type E | 52.60 | 52.45 | 52.55 | Up 0.05</p>
<p>96 | 6.60 | — | 6.60 | Flat</p>
<p>In stock trading, buyers were offering $12.50 for the Great China Match Company stock, with very little selling and no transactions.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce stock market was quite active and firm. Many stocks reached new highs. The Reclamation Stock surged to $6.9 (this price excludes interest and bonus shares) due to the company's positive report on its past performance and future prospects at the annual shareholders' meeting the previous day. At this high price, some long position holders took profits, causing the closing price to fall back to around $6.7. Shanghai Bank stock rose rapidly to $6.15 due to reports that it held a large number of Reclamation shares. Gonghexian stock last traded at $232.50, but buyers continued to raise the buying price to $233. Ruirong stock reached a new high of $8.25. Kaiping stock surged to $30.075 due to rising prices in London. The HSBC stock appeared firm, with a small number of transactions at a price of $1,405, due to rising London prices.</p>
<p>In the corporate bond market, only the China Business Company 8% bonds continued to be in demand at $59.25, while the rest were quiet.</p>
<p>The rubber stock market became active due to the rise in London raw material prices to 8.01875 pence, but price fluctuations were small.</p>
<p>The London English Commercial Far East Companies stock market on the 25th of this month (Thursday) showed strong prices. HSBC Hong Kong registered shares rose by 15 shillings to £85 5 shillings. Kaiping Coal Mine bearer shares rose another one shilling and three pence to 21 shillings and one pence, the highest price this year. Gulag Grampton Rubber shares also rose seven and a half pence to 19 shillings and four and a half pence. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London Chinese foreign debt market prices on the 25th of this month (Thursday) saw only the Reorganization Loan English issue bonds rebound by half a pound to £52. The rest remained unchanged. There was a strong demand for physical goods in London. Three thousand pounds of Reorganization Loan French issue bonds were sold at £51 5 shillings, fifteen shillings lower than the English issue listing. Also, twenty-two thousand five hundred pounds of Belgian issue bonds were sold at £48, four pounds lower than the English issue listing. Also, eight thousand pounds of Russian issue bonds were sold at £46.50, five pounds and fifty shillings lower than the English issue listing. Also, five thousand pounds of Sino-French US dollar 5% bonds (face value of US$25,000) were sold at £63.50, at par.</p>
<h3>Little Progress in Grains and Flour</h3>
<p>The flour market was quite quiet. Sales from Northern and Southern buyers, which were active after a period of low prices a few days ago, have not been active for many days. The goods traded are still being loaded, so new trading volume is very small. Northern buyers had a good demand for low-grade flour, but were put off by the high price of Grade 2 flour, repeatedly haggling and demanding a lower price of one dime. The factories were reluctant to accept this, so the market remained in a state of negotiation. Factory prices have not changed, but according to buyers, the buyer's price for Grade 2 flour has depreciated to $4.50, while the factories have not accepted that price. Besides the trading by buyers, the market also saw retail trading in other areas, totaling more than 10,000 bags, with the price remaining at $4.40 in cash. Today, 24,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Tianjin, 1,000 bags to Yantai, and 500 bags to Ningbo.</p>
<p>The supply of wheat is not high because inland prices have risen slightly recently, while the Shanghai market has been affected by various factors, causing prices to fall. This has caused the dealers to hold back, and the factories are in a long period of sluggish appetite. Japanese merchants have also seen little trading recently. The market is quiet because the new wheat harvest is approaching, and old wheat has reached the end of its season. It is reported that the street is continuing to trade in 200-300 bags of Jiangbei wheat, with the price remaining at $6. Today, 500 bags of wheat are being shipped to Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Morning Rice Market Continues to Fall Sharply, Stockpilers' Activity Returns to Normal, Hong Kong Machine Rice Enters at $19</h3>
<p>The supply of Du Geng rice from various sources arrived in He Xia, totaling nearly ten shipments. From Chelun, Baozi, and Tongli, a total of 3,400-3,500 bags arrived. At the market opening, the street remained sluggish, and the situation was very tired. Holders continued to lower prices to sell, causing the price of old stock from He Xia to fall by 30-40 cents, and the price of thick and thin Geng rice to fall by 10-20 cents. By the evening market, stockpilers believed that the market price was near bottoming out and suddenly started buying, causing the market to gradually become more active and stable. The prices of Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian rice did not change. The market lacked Ke Jian rice, and holders were unwilling to sell cheaply. The price of Jue Huo rice has fallen to $12.30-$12.40, and although the ways to sell have been limited, the market stock is also not large, so the market is flat and tired.</p>
<p>The supply of Ke Xian rice has been large, with recent shipments totaling more than 40,000 bags, causing the market to gradually decline. The severe price decline was caused by stockpilers dumping their stock. The morning market was still weak yesterday. Because the sellers felt the price was too low, they were unwilling to sell. The dealers took advantage of the low price to buy, causing the market to become tired but stable. As a result, the price level had no difference with the day before. In the afternoon, the market tightened. Even the selling price of Saigon cash rice increased, because the inventory had dried up, and the price was high. People's hearts are now mostly up. The stock of ocean meter rice arrived well, and continued to fall by a little over 20-30 cents. Yesterday, Hong Kong machine grain rice fell to 19 yuan, price opens to 18 yuan 80 or 90 cents.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Soybean Oil Rebounds but the Trend Remains Weak, New Domestic Rapeseed Oil Can Meet Demand and Arrivals Are Not Weak</h3>
<p>Because the sharp decline in soybean oil prices the previous day attracted new stockpilers, prices rebounded by 80 cents to one dollar. Transactions included 80 barrels of Dalian barrel oil at prices ranging from $35.90 to $36.20, and 200 barrels of Lian oil from Kobe at a price of $35.60. Other transactions included 100 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil at $26.50. Although the price was more than $3 lower than the previous market, it was relatively stable. Yanqi oil traded at 100 pieces at $27.50. The overall trend remained weak, as domestic sales markets will be able to meet demand with new rapeseed oil. While arrivals are not large, they are not weak either, so the market may continue to trend downward.</p>
<p>Only 250 pieces of raw oil were traded, Jiaozhou oil at $29, down a little over two dollars from the previous market. The overall trend was mediocre.</p>
<p>On the 26th, 300 pieces of soybean oil arrived from Tianjin, and 75 pieces of tea oil and 1,000 pieces of hide oil arrived from Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cakes Fluctuate Considerably, Robust June Futures Trading</h3>
<p>The market price of soybean cakes was mostly at around $2.70-$2.80, so the market was not quiet. Yesterday, 3,000 pieces of Dalian Yuanji cakes opened at prices ranging from $2.70 to $2.73, and 1,000 pieces of miscellaneous cakes at $2.6975. Prices were down 20-30 cents from the previous day. Trading in June futures cakes remained robust. The market fluctuated considerably throughout the day. The opening price was down 20-30 cents, with Yuanji cake priced at $2.73 and miscellaneous cake at $2.655. Later, buying interest increased, and prices rose steadily. There were setbacks along the way (Yuanji’s lowest price was $2.70, miscellaneous $2.64) but the price reversed quickly and trended higher. Yuan Ji cake's highest price reached $2.75, with the miscellaneous cake reaching $2.71, the end result was a falling market overall. Yuanji closed at $2.72, and miscellaneous at $2.6875. It is estimated that the total volume traded was over 28,000 pieces.</p>
<p>On the 26th, 70 bags of corn arrived from Beisha, and 12,600 bags of raw peanuts arrived from Yantai.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: The Price of Crude White Sugar is Uncertain</h3>
<p>The price of crude white sugar rebounded yesterday after falling in London the day before. The trend is unclear. According to telegrams, August rose by one penny to 6 shillings 10.25 pence, December rose by 2.5 pence to 6 shillings 1.5 pence, and March of next year rose by 2.25 pence to 6 shillings 2 pence. As a result, the market here improved slightly. The current spot price for No. 2 crude white from local warehouses is $27.3, and from foreign warehouses is $27.1. 400 bags of goods for re-export, arriving on June 3, were sold at $19. Taikoo Da Jin Qian Mark stock from local warehouses traded at $27.8. According to telegrams from Hong Kong, the cost of packaging to Shanghai is $19. Taikoo Che Bai was priced at the original price, and local factory Mian Bai was down two dimes, Zhenji No. 1 at $26.8, No. 2 at $26.3, No. 3 at $25.8, and No. 4 at $25.3. There were few sugar transactions. Pian Qing No. 4 was offered at a slightly lower price, but no deal was made.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Dried Lily Buds Sales to Shantou are Relatively Active</h3>
<p>Dried Lily Buds sales to Shantou were the most active. Several dozens of bags of medium-grade goods have been purchased at a price of around $20. Several dozens of bags of good quality goods have been put up for sale by Zhenjiang buyers, at a price of 20 yuan, and sells for 18 yuan. If demand from other buyers increases, there is a chance of further price increases. Most of the stock in the market has been dried and can be stored for a long time.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Tunxi Mushrooms Trend Downward</h3>
<p>The arrival of mushrooms from various regions remains constant, and inventories here are gradually increasing. With the approach of the moldy season, if they are not dried, they must be stored in cold storage facilities. However, the former results in weight loss, while the latter is expensive, making both options economically unfeasible. Therefore, yesterday, a batch of Tunxi mushrooms was offered at a price that was abruptly 20-30% lower than the previous market price. For example, large pieces of Tunxi mushrooms were priced at 280.60 yuan, medium-sized mushrooms at 276 yuan, and regular grade at 238.80 to 237.70 yuan.</p>
<h3>Pepper Market Quiet</h3>
<p>Pepper inventories here are considered sufficient, but due to limited transactions, the market is quite quiet. Consequently, recent market prices have softened. For example, Grade 1 pepper is priced at 555 yuan, black pepper at 54 yuan, and white pepper at 60 yuan, a decrease of 2-3 yuan compared to previous prices.</p>
<h3>Metals: Pig Iron Billets Recover After Weakness</h3>
<p>Previously, the market for pig iron billets was sluggish due to an unusually large influx of goods and stalled sales channels. This caused market prices to decline temporarily. However, yesterday, driven by actions from Tianjin traders, along with local manufacturers of thermos bottles and ironworks, such as the Qiu Ironworks, a standard was suddenly and vigorously established. It is estimated that over 400 cases were offered throughout the city, with Tianjin traders purchasing 200 cases and local factories purchasing over 100 cases. Currently, the market price is 30.05 yuan per 200-pound case and 33 yuan per 2,000-pound case (calculated at 200 pounds per case), an increase of several yuan compared to previous market prices.</p>

<p>Transportation and Shipping Weekly</p>
<h3>A New Route to the Interior</h3>
<p>— Respect</p>
<p>Since transportation to the interior through ports in Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces, such as Wenzhou, Ningbo, Fuzhou, Shantou, and Guangzhouwan, has been disrupted, the only safe and fast route to the interior is via French Indochina. However, going to the interior of our country through a second country involves considerable procedures. First, one must apply to Chinese government agencies for a permit. Second, one must request the consulate of the second country to stamp an approval for transit. Only then can one purchase a ticket and depart. Based on recent circumstances, completing these procedures in Shanghai takes a considerable amount of time, probably no less than five or six weeks. Applying for departure procedures in Hong Kong is considered too expensive. Therefore, people with limited financial means who urgently need to go to the interior face significant difficulties. To facilitate public travel, the author believes it is necessary to investigate alternative routes to the interior other than via Haiphong. According to investigations, transit to the interior via Shantou was temporarily interrupted after authorities deliberately destroyed a section of the highway between Jieyang and Fengshun. However, it is now reported that waterways can substitute for that section, ensuring that the entire route remains unaffected. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Shanghai to Shantou: Ships from both the Taikoo and Jardine shipping companies operate directly, with one or two sailings per week, taking just over two days. Ticket prices are graded: deluxe cabin, 75 or 90 yuan; officer's cabin, 40 yuan; room cabin, 28 yuan; bunk, 20 yuan; steerage, 16 yuan.</p>
<p>2. Shantou to Chao'an: Trains are available, taking only 1.5 hours.</p>
<p>3. Chao'an to Songkou: Small steamers depart Chao'an daily at 3:00 PM, arriving in Songkou at 7:30 PM the next day.</p>
<p>4. Songkou to Meixian: Highway buses depart for Meixian from 6:00 AM daily. The journey to Meixian takes only two hours, with four to five departures daily.</p>
<p>5. Meixian to Xingning: One bus departs at 10:00 AM daily, arriving in Xingning at 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>6. Xingning to Shaoguan (Qujiang): Highway buses operate frequently at any time, reaching Shaoguan in about two days.</p>
<p>In summary, the journey from Shanghai to Shaoguan takes only ten days. Upon reaching Shaoguan, travelers can decide on the appropriate route based on their final destination. The fare from Shantou to Shaoguan is just over 40 yuan. Those traveling to places like Chongqing can take the Yuehan Railway directly from Shaoguan to Changsha, a one-day trip with a third-class fare of 6.05 yuan. From Changsha, one can take a highway bus via Changde, Yuanling, Dushan, Qianjiang, and Nanchuan to Qijiang, which is only 84 kilometers from Chongqing, a five-day journey with a fare of 57.65 yuan. From Qijiang, a bus from the Southwest Highway Bureau will take you to Haitangxi in just three hours, with a fare of just over 3.90 yuan. For those going to Guangxi Province, one can take a train from Shaoguan to Hengyang, a seven-hour journey with a third-class fare of 3.95 yuan, and then follow the Xianggui Railway to Guilin. The express train departs from Hengyang West Station daily at 9:10 PM, arriving in Guilin at 1:50 PM the next day, with a third-class fare of 5.25 yuan. From Guilin, one can transfer to various destinations.</p>
<p>However, the truth is that traveling to the interior via Shantou and Qujiang is only advisable for young, single travelers. It is inconvenient for those with families and large amounts of luggage. What makes it difficult for travelers is that the local dialect is not easy to understand, which is also a problem for travel. Therefore, the safest and most reliable way to the interior is still via Vietnam!</p>
<h3>The Sichuan-Yunnan Eastern Road</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>The development of inland transportation infrastructure, especially highways, is advancing rapidly. The reason for accelerating construction is to facilitate travel, develop resources, and revitalize industry, not to mention other benefits. Recently, the news of the completion of the Sichuan-Yunnan Eastern Road is exciting.</p>
<p>The Sichuan-Yunnan Eastern Road connects the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway with the Guizhou-Yunnan section of the Southwest Highway. It starts at Longchang, a central station on the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway, 200 kilometers from Chongqing, and ends at Tianshengqiao in Zhanxian, Yunnan Province, just over ten li from the Qujing station on the Guizhou-Yunnan Highway. Qujing is 170 kilometers from Kunming. From Longchang in Sichuan, the road passes through Luxian, Naxi, and Xuyong to reach the Chishui River, the border between Sichuan and Guizhou, a distance of 274.3 kilometers. From the Chishui River, it passes through Bijie and Weining to reach Shanmugui, the border between Guizhou and Yunnan, a distance of 365.3 kilometers. From Shanmugui on the Yunnan border, it passes through Yiwei to reach Tianshengqiao in Zhanxian, a distance of 160.8 kilometers, with a total length of 800.4 kilometers.</p>
<p>This highway is mostly mountainous, and the construction was quite extensive. The Miao and Yi people make up a significant portion of the population in this region, making travel less convenient and reliable than between Kunming, Guiyang, and Chongqing. Some people believe that taking the Sichuan-Yunnan Eastern Road from Chongqing to Kunming is closer than going through Guiyang, as the Sichuan-Yunnan Eastern Road is simply the hypotenuse of a triangle, saving the other two sides. However, the reality is not that simple. Travelers starting from Chengdu may save some distance by taking the Sichuan-Yunnan Eastern Road to Kunming. However, going from Chongqing to Kunming involves adding the 200 kilometers between Chongqing and Longchang and the 183 kilometers between Zhanxian and Kunming to the 800 kilometers of the Sichuan-Yunnan Eastern Road itself, totaling 1183 kilometers. In comparison, Chongqing to Guiyang is 488 kilometers, and Guiyang to Kunming is 662 kilometers, totaling only 1150 kilometers. Therefore, it is actually shorter to go from Chongqing to Kunming via Guiyang.</p>
<p>Regarding freight, goods entering Sichuan from Yunnan can be shipped from Luxian, which is much more convenient than road transportation. In short, the completion of the Sichuan-Yunnan Eastern Road is noteworthy.</p>

<h3>Travel Inquiries</h3>
<p>Mr. Song Zhenyu inquired about passport application procedures:</p>
<p>(Answer) 1. The passport applicant should write to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to apply for a passport. To simplify procedures, the China Travel Service can be entrusted to write on their behalf. After obtaining the passport, it must be signed by the French consulate. 2. Mandarin Chinese is not widely spoken in Vietnam. Speaking Cantonese is more convenient.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Yue, Mr. Lu Yihuan, Mr. Zhou Dafang, and Mr. Xi Jimo inquired about going to Yunnan via Vietnam:</p>
<p>(Answer) 1. Immunization and smallpox vaccination certificates must be issued by doctors designated by the British and French Municipal Council Health Department and the French Consulate to be valid. 2. A school diploma cannot be used as proof of identity. It is better to have the school issue a separate certificate. 3. Only a small number of personal books and medicines can be carried. Otherwise, taxes must be paid according to regulations. Western books must be inspected by the Vietnamese authorities before they can be returned. New or almost new clothing and personal items are likely to be taxed. New Chinese clothing can be avoided. 4.

<p>In his recent broadcast speech in America, the King of England stated that the civilizations of Europe and Asia are indeed in a state of turmoil, and one of the British Empire's greatest tasks is to make the Empire a link between the two worlds in harmony. This statement is accurate. A war anywhere in the world has the potential to affect everything, as the saying goes, "If one place is at peace, all places are at peace."</p>
<p>Now, it is imperative to conclude a three-way mutual assistance alliance with France and the Soviet Union. Reportedly, this agreement only applies to Europe and does not extend to the Far East. Why is this? Does a war in the Far East have absolutely no connection to Europe? Does a war in Europe have absolutely no connection to the Far East? Is the Far East not part of the world? Why exclude the Far East alone?</p>
<p>Leaving China aside, the Soviet Union is largely located in the Far East. Why does the Soviet Union need to participate if something happens in Europe? If something happens to the Soviet Union in the Far East, would England and France stand idly by? If something happens to the Soviet Union in the Far East and England and France also need to help, then how can you say that this agreement does not extend to the Far East? I don't know which one of the thousands and hundreds of fallacies this reasoning is based on. You claim to adhere to the principle of absolute equality, but where is the equality?</p>
<h3>Charity Sale Movement at Fudan University</h3>
<p>— Ren Yong</p>
<p>Young masters act as newsboys</p>
<p>Young ladies sell flowers</p>
<p>"Charity sale, charity sale!" This cry adorns the tragic May, roaring like a lion, howling like the north wind! Shaking every corner.</p>
<p>This great cry reached Fudan University: On May 16th, the women's association held a "Yellow Flower Charity Sale"; the next day, the school newspaper society held a "School Newspaper Charity Sale"!</p>
<p>On the morning of the 16th, the female students began selling their handmade yellow flowers, a paper flower, a sentimental yellow. According to the announcement, they were made to commemorate the painful May, hence the "yellow" flowers. In just one morning, they sold about 129 yuan worth. This was a test, and the test did not disappoint.</p>
<p>"Flower girl," this character who has always been praised by poets and writers, is now truly worthy of praise. This is a groundbreaking event: young ladies are selling flowers, selling over a hundred yuan in one morning! Poets will say: "Great, this great group of flower girls!"</p>
<p>The "flower girls" called out all morning, and the next day, the "newsboys" arrived. On May 17th, the school newspaper society held a "school newspaper charity sale." Two square tables were placed by the gatehouse, along with a charity box and a stack of school newspapers. There was also a group of temporary "newsboys," holding a stack of priceless publications to sell during breaks. It was just a four-page newspaper, a thin half-sheet, yet someone generously paid 20 yuan; even the smallest amount, one dime, was five times larger than this newspaper (Shen Bao). After settling accounts in the evening, they sold more than 260 yuan! Although I haven't actually investigated, I guess it must have broken the newspaper selling record, right?</p>
<p>Mr. Gardener of the school newspaper society said: This is a kind of enlightenment and hopes there will be more events in the future. Yes, isolated island classmates, respond! Launch a charity sale movement in the student community. Everyone has their own skills and different ways to be clever. Come, think of some tricks to do charity sales and charity purchases! Charity sellers are putting in effort, and charity buyers are putting in money. This is a patriotic avenue for us right now! (Charity sale donations)</p>
<h3>Sewing and Embroidery Charity Sale Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Flying Swallow</p>
<p>Most products are Western-style children's clothing, four sewing machines demonstrate machine embroidery methods, over one hundred yuan already ordered yesterday morning, hoping people from all walks of life will actively purchase in the last two days</p>
<p>I don't think anyone would object to women sewing their own clothes, both for thrift and economic convenience. It is certainly more convenient for girls to be able to cut and sew themselves than to have a tailor do it. Because the daughters of small-bourgeois families, who are used to being lazy, comfortable, and extravagant, are not likely to move their needles and threads to sew clothes at this time. On the one hand, all kinds of things are available on the market; as long as you have money, you can buy anything. On the other hand, modern women rarely pick up needles and threads, which is also a fact.</p>
<p>According to people, some modern women (such as those who are very active in social circles) are unwilling to sew even a stitch when their socks are torn. We certainly want everyone to correct this kind of "virtue" of modern women.</p>
<p>However, we do not absolutely advocate that women must be able to sew their own clothes. If it is for the sake of living, and they specialize in becoming sewing and embroidery experts, this is of course an exception.</p>
<p>My point is: It is certainly wrong for women to never touch needles and threads, but when learning needlework, at this time, in addition to courses like those offered by the China Women's Sewing School, we must also teach them the spirit of new Chinese women warriors, so that they know that in addition to these purely maternal sewing tasks, they must learn all the political and military knowledge of women warriors, so that these girls do not think that learning to sew is their highest goal.</p>
<p>The motivation of this exhibition and charity sale by the training center is of course good. To be able to take out all the works and carry out the charity sale is also something that women should do. (It is said that the Professional Women's Club is also preparing to hold a charity sale of sewing and embroidery products at the end of June.) The exhibition venue is on the fourth floor of the Great New World department store. Since Mr. Rong Dakuai's landscape paintings exhibition has not yet ended, the area occupied by the training center is only half of the original venue.</p>
<p>Most of the products are Western-style children's clothing, such as workers' clothing and trousers, Western-style girls' and children's clothing, as well as embroidered bedsheets, tablecloths, pillowcases, velvet cushions, ...</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the reception, the staff are all female students from the Fu Xi Institute. In the middle of the venue, there are four sewing machines, and four female students are demonstrating machine embroidery methods to visitors. At the innermost part of the venue, there is an office for ordering clothes and taking measurements. If customers want to tailor a certain style of clothing, they can take measurements on the spot.</p>
<p>Finally, I had the following Q&amp;A with a female receptionist in their venue:</p>
<p>"Do you accept outside clothes?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but it is mostly through friends' referrals."</p>
<p>"How is the labor cost calculated?"</p>
<p>"It is calculated together with the cost of the clothing materials, depending on the material and style. The price is not fixed."</p>
<p>"How is this charity sale calculated? Do you deduct the cost first? For example-" I pointed to a large bed sheet and said, "The price is set at ten yuan. How much money can you get from the charity sale?"</p>
<p>"The cost is probably seven or eight yuan-"</p>
<p>"So that's 20 percent. Two yuan is taken from ten yuan as a charity sale, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes-;" However, she glanced at the exhibition venue, "This time, the price is slightly higher than usual due to the charity sale. It is cheaper to custom-make clothes on weekdays."</p>
<p>I saw that many ordered red paper strips had been posted on the exhibits in the venue, so I asked further:</p>
<p>"Have you sold a lot today?"</p>
<p>She thought for a while before saying:</p>
<p>"About one hundred yuan!"</p>
<p>More than one hundred yuan has already been ordered in one morning, and the results are still good. But I think that extracting 20 percent for the charity sale is a little too little. I think it would be more meaningful to add some products that are completely charity sale.</p>
<p>There are two more days left in the exhibition period. Housewives may wish to take their children to visit. There is no admission fee there.</p>
<h3>Rain After Clearing</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Simple Bun and Green Skirt: A Virtuous Mother; Silver Beard and Emerald Sleeves: A Spirited Old Man</p>
<p>Zhu Airen said, "Mr. Zhao Letian? I know him. Why didn't you tell me you met him on the train these past few days?" She turned to Li Yu and said, "We forgot all about it as soon as we got off the train. We only talked to him on the train because he was sitting opposite us, and the train was crowded, so he offered his seat to Miss Wu Junsu. He was going to Wuxi. He even waved goodbye when we got off the train. I doubt you noticed when you came to pick us up, right? We'd completely forgotten. It's only because Sister Aiqun mentioned that Mr. Zhao Letian only has one leg and that there's a love story involved that we suddenly remembered: the name Zhao Letian sounded very familiar. And because Sister Aiqun said 'one leg,' we immediately thought of the gentleman we met on the train." Village Chief Zhu said, "So you only met him once." At this point, He Liyu was eager to know how this one-legged man had managed to get involved in a love affair. Was he pursuing someone, or was someone pursuing him, a man with only one leg? Because marriage for war-wounded veterans was quite a problem. Back in the days of the expedition, most young men were unmarried, and some patriotic and brave men who were engaged to be married even broke off their engagements to go to war. They said, 'How can I think of family when the barbarians haven't been exterminated?' They didn't want to delay the young women's youth and encouraged them to find other good matches. By the time the war ended, some had sacrificed themselves for the country, and others were seriously injured, becoming disabled. But a disabled man seeking marriage was definitely at a disadvantage. The aggressors in our neighboring country once used coercion to force young women to marry disabled soldiers unconditionally, leading to many tragedies. That country had always despised women, treating them as appendages of men. They treated women like livestock, shipping them back and forth on boats and trains, and marriages could be arranged based on photographs. But this issue also became a problem in our China after the war. At first, they heard Zhao Letian say on the train that his parents were dead, he had never married, and he was a free man, so he had no worries. Now, it seems he has a family and children and is no longer alone. So she asked Airen, 'Is Mr. Zhao Letian involved in a love story? Do you know about it, Sister Airen?' Airen said, 'I don't know. Ask Aiqun.'" Aiqun was straightforward and felt that her casual remark had led to these questions. Truly:</p>
<p>Since ancient times, heroes have loved beauty,</p>
<p>And naturally, children are sentimental. (12)</p>
<h3>Impressions of "Grass Skirt Temptation"</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>HONOLULU</p>
<p>Produced by MGM</p>
<p>First, I'd like to briefly describe the story of "Grass Skirt Temptation": Film star Mason is often surrounded by fans, which he finds distressing, and he longs for a peaceful vacation. Coincidentally, a Honolulu plantation owner named George looks just like Mason (both played by Robert Young), so they make a deal. George goes to New York with Mason's manager, Duffy, and Mason buys a return ticket to Honolulu under George's name. Of course, we can imagine the many jokes that arise from this "switch."</p>
<p>From this story, we can see that the playwright's greatest intention is to melt all "business eyes" into one pot, allowing the gentlemen and ladies under the screen to have ninety minutes of enjoyment—laughing and clapping their hands.</p>
<p>Here, Robert Young plays two roles, shaking hands and talking, which is a photographic technique. Two clowns, George Burns and Gracie Allen, are also inserted to elicit laughter from the audience with witty remarks. The jokes that arise from the "switch" can naturally be arranged at will. And the most important part of "Grass Skirt Temptation" is, of course, the hula dance performed by the dance queen Ilene Baugher, with "jade legs twirling, flowers trembling, and the spring scene unmasked in the grass skirt dance," which is the program that draws the largest audience; thus, Honolulu is translated into such a moving "Grass Skirt Temptation"!</p>
<p>In fact, just as "Yes, My Darling Daughter" would copy lines from "Romance of the Western Chamber," Honolulu does indeed feature Ilene Baugher's hula dance, so why can't it be translated as "Grass Skirt Temptation"? However, at the same time, we can also see that even "thigh-flying" erotic films have reached their limit; otherwise, why would advertisers need to further exaggerate them? And what good will come after this further exaggeration reaches its "limit"?</p>
<p>But, regrettably, just as Hollywood's erotic films are reaching their dead end, our country's film merchants during the war of resistance are burying their heads and rushing to catch up, using scalpels to dissect women in detail. Is this your shame, my shame, or the shame of every Chinese person? What do you say?</p>

<h3>Dispute Between Two Professional Theater Troupes</h3>
<p>— Victor</p>
<p>Hoping for the sake of the entire theater movement</p>
<p>Mutual understanding with a calm and peaceful attitude</p>
<p>This magazine has reported that the Shanghai Art Theater, which has excellent actors in the Shanghai theater scene, will be transformed into a professional theater troupe, but now, according to information from various sources, this plan of the Shanghai Art Theater has been obviously hindered. After careful analysis of the inside story, we found that "personnel disputes" are at play again. How can personnel disputes and unnecessary frictions in the theater scene be eliminated? I think, as long as everyone calmly and peacefully sees the facts clearly, and slowly unties this "dead knot" with the most gentle attitude, the problem can always be solved.</p>
<p>The whole story is like this: First of all, the plan of the Art Theater was to rent the Yan Palace Ballroom and turn it into a theater for the Art Theater to perform regularly, and the Xuan Palace Ballroom would be moved to the La Fei Garden; the plan was of course very good, but a "Cheng Yaojin halfway" almost completely overturned the Art Theater's plans.</p>
<p>Who is this "Cheng Yaojin"? It is the Sino-French Art School, and the person in charge of this school was originally one of the important pillars of the Art Theater.</p>
<p>The matter developed very quickly. Before the Shanghai Art Theater had finalized the deal with the La Fei Garden, Feng Zhizhong, the principal of the Sino-French Art School, quickly signed a contract with the La Fei Garden, preparing to establish a new professional theater troupe immediately. Moreover, it was stipulated that Zhong Yi would be exclusively responsible for the Sino-French Art School, and Xu Xingzhi would be exclusively responsible for the newest professional theater troupe.</p>
<p>The problem lies in this place. Once the La Fei Garden is rented out, the Xuan Palace Ballroom will inevitably have no way to move, then the plan of the Art Theater to use the Xuan Palace as its base will also be suddenly hindered.</p>
<p>At this time, it is only natural that several people in charge of the Sino-French Art School were blamed, so under this situation, they had to use the method of "cutting the Gordian knot quickly" to resign from the Sino-French Art School, and "retreat bravely".</p>
<p>Although this method of "drawing firewood from under the pot" can reduce the excessively high heat for a while, this method of "withdrawing troops" did not solve the problem.</p>
<p>Under this situation, the anxiety and unease of both sides are also inevitable, so both sides decided to hold a conference a few days ago, and someone came forward to mediate this matter.</p>
<p>Now, the result is not yet clear for the time being, but there are two points that can be determined:</p>
<p>(1) The Shanghai Art Theater's theater troupe must be realized according to the original plan. The Sino-French School professional theater troupe organized by Zhang Zhizhong alone will also inevitably be established.</p>
<p>(2) As for how to complete these two plans, I hope that both sides can consider the entire Chinese theater movement and talk calmly and peacefully.</p>

<h3>"The Hypocrite" to be Performed Tonight and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>— Xi Tong</p>
<p>Winning applause at the preview</p>
<p>A good show worth watching</p>
<p>Molière's masterpiece "The Hypocrite," a great playwright of the 17th century, will be performed tonight and tomorrow in the Sino-French Hall on Huanlong Road, French Concession, by the Haiyan Drama Club of Shanghai University.</p>
<p>According to Baring's "French Literature": "Molière is the greatest writer best known to the world of all French writers, and also the most representative of France. La Fontaine has too many lyrical elements, not as sufficient as Molière to represent him. Molière's personal life is full of thorns and hardships: he is a wandering actor, his initial audience and personal environment were not good. His plays are appealed to the masses. He is the world's greatest comedian. His style is sometimes not very decorated, and there are times when there are shortcomings, because it is made too fast. But no matter how opposed to him, Molière still does not lose its place as a supreme and successful playwright. His plays are completely written for the stage. His comedies touch the hearts of the masses. His comedies are only spoken on the stage, not seen in the study. That is to say, performing on stage today is still as powerful as when it was first written and first performed."</p>
<p>Indeed, Molière is an experienced playwright. He himself came from acting. Louis XIV saw that his plays were well-performed, and then gave him special honor and favor. This "Hypocrite" and his own "Don Juan" are both against a part of hypocritical religion, believers. "The Hypocrite" is aimed at the Rixuedepai monks who were taking power at that time. At that time, the author was forty-two years old, and seeing these monks breaking the rules and being lecherous, he wrote this angrily, to satirize these Pharisees who only washed the outside of cups and plates. After the publication of this work, the monks who had power above the emperor banned the performance. Later, due to the changes of the times, "The Hypocrite" was finally allowed to be staged, so the audience welcomed it more enthusiastically. The so-called Daixifu in the original text means hypocrite, and now it is taken as the name of the protagonist in the play.</p>
<p>This time, Shanghai University performed this play, with Westerners Shawmsky, Jing, Mrs. Skora in charge of makeup, and Kamensky designing costumes, so everything is suitable for the 17th-century French costumes and scenes, and it can also be seen that their handling of affairs is not ambiguous. At the preview the other day, the voice of the hypocrite was calm and trembling, and his steps were steady and practiced, which was indeed easy to confuse people; the maid Du Ying performed very lively, and Emmy also performed very alertly; the few words of the patrol police, although not many, were spoken in a tactful and proper manner, soft but hard, and the tone was also good. There was laughter throughout the audience. This is really a good show worth watching. (Charity sale for donations)</p>
<p>Dance World Sketches (24)</p>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<h3>Words from the Ballroom</h3>
<p>Doing business is not an easy task. Think about it, to move the money from other people's pockets into your own pocket is not a robbery, not a secret theft, and you can't use fraudulent means. You have to make people willingly take it out of their pockets and send it to your hands. If you don't give people a considerable benefit, will it work? To let people enjoy a kind of benefit, you already have to spend a lot of labor and a lot of capital. If the method is not used properly, even if you spend a lot of capital and create a kind of benefit for people to enjoy, people are still not willing to come and enjoy it. At that time, not only will the money in other people's pockets not be moved into your own pocket, but the money in your own pocket will inevitably be moved into other people's pockets. Therefore, it is said that eating a line, this is from looking at that mountain high, and when you get to that mountain, you look at this mountain high again.</p>
<p>Some time ago, several clerks came back from auditing the accounts in the ballroom, all sighing and envying, thinking that the boss of the ballroom had a profit of several thousand yuan, and the staff did not need to pay the capital, and were always in a magnificent house, listening to intoxicating music, wonderful singing, watching lightly made up and heavily painted young girls, and getting wages when the time came, how pleasant. In fact, these are all because they only saw the surface of the ballroom, and did not know the inside story. The ballroom authorities, in order to attract customers, spared no effort, day and night. If the seats are not comfortable, customers are not willing to come; if they are too wide, more customers will come to the point where there are not enough seats, which indirectly reduces income. The configuration of the lights, if they are too bright, hinders love talk, and if they are too dark, hinders the vision of choosing a dance partner. If the color is too gaudy, it is said to be vulgar and unbearable, and if it is too elegant, it is said to be like the decoration of a funeral home. There are those who like the shape of the dance floor, and there are those who like the length. Some people like the floor to be slippery, and some people say it should not be too slippery. The more people in the music team, the more expensive the price will naturally be, but some customers say it is too noisy. If the number of people is small, the price will naturally be cheaper, and customers will say it is too Guihua (meaning inferior). As for the extremely popular dance stars, it is even more difficult to serve. The red stars make money every day, but as the value is high, and where they are, other dance halls will have to dig them up. If they are slightly inconsiderate, they will jump ship. As for the black stars, the ballroom can't see any of their brands, and a ballroom only has a few good seats in total. Red stars are of course going to sit in good seats, so if you invite too many red stars, the seat problem is enough trouble.</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Thinking of spending public funds to train ten outstanding students</p>
<p>Let's take the Chinese Opera School as an example. The country has spared no expense to establish and maintain the progress of the school with more than 200,000 public funds, but the result is only less than ten outstanding students (in other words, seven or eight famous actors have been trained). This is inevitably not worth the loss. I said above that since the school is a disguised version of the old-style opera troupe, then these outstanding students will of course go to form their own teams after graduation, hoping to earn a big bag of silver of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan per month like Mei Lanfang and Ma Lianliang, and enjoy the life of the aristocratic class. Trying to get the country to take out hundreds of thousands of huge sums of money to invite many famous teachers is equivalent to working as cattle and horses for these very few seven or eight people for nothing. Thinking about it, it is really not worth it. There is another saying that all public money must be used on the society and the people. If these new actors can take on the responsibility of changing customs and improving society in the future, this is still the original purpose of using comedy to assist social education, and even the little money that the Ministry of Education and the Beiping Re-education Bureau used to subsidize the school every month is not wasted. I am only afraid that after they leave their alma mater, they will commit the problems I mentioned above, only caring about personal enjoyment and not having the idea of serving the society and the people at all. Wouldn't this waste the country's useful public funds? It is said that three years ago, the school was taken over by Cheng Yanqiu's people again. As for whether Cheng and others have new facilities after taking over, we have not heard or seen anything. Now let me first introduce the names of several outstanding students of the school below, and attach a few stills. Readers, you can treat them as students, or you can treat them as new actors. It is that the authorities of the Shanghai Theatre regard them as the pillars of the future, and they also invite disciples from Fu Liancheng on a large scale to go south, earning 30,000 to 50,000 yuan for the theater. This is even more impossible. However, what is feared is that the two sides of Fu Society and Opera School had quite fierce undercurrents in Ping City, mutually attacking each other, each with its own cheering (not cheering for the actors, but cheering for the society and the school) groups, so it is not easy for the students of the school and the society to cooperate. The society has deep roots and a long history. All the disciples of several subjects have gone south to perform successively, and some have even penetrated into the theater to be in the company. If only three or five people come out of the opera school and sing in the south, not only will they not be able to invite good supporting actors such as Ma Fulu, Ye Shenglan, Liu Lianrong, and Cao Lianxiao, but also there may be people in the Shanghai team who will make trouble for them, so this is also the biggest reason why the talents of the opera school cannot show their skills in the south. In fact, Wang Helin's singing old student, Wang Linglu and Fu Dewei's martial arts students, Guan Dexian's red students, work old students, Zhao Jinrong, Hou Yulan, Song Dezhu and other patterned shirts, Zhao Deyu, Xiao Deyin and other upright vice-pure, are also passable. The high and low of art is also no less than that of the disciples of the Fu Society. The art of several outstanding students trained by more than 100,000 public funds, but the people of Shanghai have no chance to see it. Can it not be said that this is a pity! (22)</p>

<h3>Record of Survival from the Fish's Belly</h3>
<p>I took the Xidan steamship from Hong Kong to Shanghai. When it reached the Fujian sea, suddenly the front of the ship shook greatly, the sound was like a thunderbolt, and everyone ran in panic to the upper deck. They saw that the ship had hit a reef and overturned, water entered the fire room, and smoke rose. There were four or five people holding wooden objects and throwing themselves into the sea. The foreigners were panicked and drove four small sampans, leading the sailors to escape. More than a dozen agile passengers were able to follow them. There was still a small sampan that the foreigners abandoned. Everyone regarded it as a rare commodity and jumped down to compete for it. Before their bodies were settled in the boat, their heads were submerged in the waves. None of the dozens of people survived. I and forty-four old, weak, women and children were waiting to die with our hands tied. Fortunately, the bow of the ship was grounded on a hidden reef, and the stern of the ship was inserted in the scarf of the hidden reef, standing巍然and fearless. No matter how the earth moves and the sky spins, our hearts and minds are shattered, then the keel of the bottom of the ship is sharp and uneven, and the boat turns over and lies down. Wiping our eyes and looking at it, more than two feet were not immersed by the waves, and after the shock was settled, the people were relieved. Until the night watch, the sea breeze howled, and the heavy rain poured down, everyone curled up like worms and sat around to keep out the cold. The wind stirred the water and鳴, and the waves rolled up and down. When the east was white, small fishing boats attached to the ship like ants. Everyone went down the rope, and the eighteen women tied their waists with ropes and fell. The silverware and wet clothes were all given to the fishermen. After walking a mile or so, looking back at the 洋舶that hit the reef, it shrank into the sea. If there is a moment of delay, there is no complete egg. Thinking about it in the清夜, I am afraid! The boat is near a small mountain, blocked by the shallows, thirty or forty feet from the shore, so we walked barefoot to the front, and the people rested in the sand. Then we arrived at an island, in its concave there are several thatched huts, where the fishermen live. I stayed there for one night. The next day, I took a boat to go, and arrived at Haitan after staying for one night. Huang鎮軍and the sea defense Tang司馬added撫卹, and those who survived by sampan also came to the meeting, a total of fifty-seven people, and from then on they转达to Fujian Province. Pan方伯gave thirty yuan each. Just in time, the official round伏波returned to Zhejiang, and I came to Shanghai with the people. I made a record of survival from the fish's belly to narrate myself.</p>
