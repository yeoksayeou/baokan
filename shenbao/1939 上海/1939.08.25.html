<h3>羅斯福總統電請義國王　居間調停歐洲危局　張伯倫宣布波蘭仍願與德談判　對蘇聯與德秘密諒解表示不滿</h3>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統頃電達義大利國國王愛麥虞限三世、請其提出建議、俾爲現行危機獲一解決方案、（二十四日哈瓦斯急電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統致義大利國王愛麥虞限三世電、係由美國大使於廿四日午後二時（羅馬鐘點）向國王宣讀、其時墨索里尼首相齊亞諾外相均在場、（廿五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統返京後卽宣稱、渠所由電達義國國王愛麥虞限三世之故、乃欲再度努力消弭戰禍、同時並吿以義大利政府、若果接受此項建議、「自爲美國熱烈同情所寄」云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　今日下院重行開會、首相張伯倫在歡呼聲中宣稱、「余如前所聲明者、今願再度聲明、即如事故發生、則英政府準備用其全力、而不延緩」、首相謂、蘇德協定之宣布、如對英政府所投之炸彈、當英法蘇正在進行談判之際、蘇聯竟秘密與德國談判、以遂其與英政府外交政策牴觸之勾當、政府第一資任、爲宜布英國對波蘭所負之義務、仍如前不變、希特勒以爲東歐者、乃德國應自由行動之地域、渠希望理智與正氣、得於目前危機中覓一出路、今日和戰二途、不操諸英國之手、如吾人被迫從事充滿全人類種種痛苦災患之奮鬥、而其結果無人能預料者、則吾人之戰鬥、非爲博取外國遙遠之一城一邑、實爲爭求保持原則、此種原則之摧毀、亦即世界各民族和平安全一切可能性之摧毀也、首相續謂、渠深信與己同負責任者、將念及數百萬生靈之命運、今悉繫於彼等之行動、至於吾人自己、今有團結一致之國家爲政府之後盾（衆歡呼）云、（二十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　下議院頃於本日午後復會、張伯倫首相當即就歐洲時局發表聲明、略謂、國際局勢日益惡劣、戰爭危機迫在眉睫、吾國務須從新採取嚴厲措置、用以應付此種嚴重局勢、德國方面會發出消息、謂波蘭境內日耳曼人受有虐待、此與去歲對於捷克國之所爲、前後如出一轍、德國現已準備就緒、隨時均可作戰、波蘭國各政治家熊度鎭靜、均能善自尅制、仍擬與德國政府討論現行爭議、惟須確知在討論時不致受暴力之威脅、且能保有相當的信心而後可、至以德蘇兩國成立互不侵犯條的而論、英國政府聞悉之餘、旣甚詫異、且亦不樂、此實無可諱言、德蘇兩國調整邦交之說、傳之已久、但蘇聯政府迄未以此意通吿吾國、或通告法國政府、値茲英法兩國正以相互信用心為基礎、而與蘇聯進行談判時、該國竟與德國秘密進行談判、其在表面上之目標、叉與吾人所想像之外交政策相牴觸、此在吾人、至少亦當爲不安、（各議員歡呼）、德蘇互不侵犯條的意義何在、影響如何、吾人即當與法國政府交換意見、目下時機尙未成熟、余殊不願遽下斷言、吾國現正採取防禦措置、如謂吾人意存威脅、並非眞相之談、吾人過去與未來舉動、均不以威脅加諸德國之正當利益、即援助友邦抵禦暴力之所爲、亦不得視同威脅、英格蘭銀行貼現率、現自二厘加至四厘、此係正常的保障辦法、乃欲在不安定的時間、保障吾國資余、勿令流出國外」、至是、首相叉談及駐德大使漢德森爵士會晤德國元首希特勒事、略謂、此舉係將吾國立塲再度通告希特勒元首、藉以防止一切誤解、英德兩國若果發生戰事、實乃莫大禍害、余乃以此意轉知希特勒元首、蓋英以政府見解而論、波蘭國與德國一切問題、均不必訴諸戰爭即可予以解决、且亦不應訴諸戰爭、希特勒元首所作答辭、不外再度說明德國主張、謂該國應在東歐洲保有行動之自由、此種說法、實乃完全誤解英國立塲、緣央國並未要求在東歐洲保有特殊地位故也、希特勒元首又以未來戰爭之責任、諉諸妨碍德國利益之國家、但若謂一國民族之利益、必須經由流血或摧毀他國之獨立、乃可予以滿足、余實未敢苟同、首相至此、感動之情溢於言表、乃在各議員熱烈鼓拿聲中、提出結論云、余嘗盡其在我、努力保持和平、此乃上帝明鑒所及、茲若不幸失敗、吾國倘亦迫不獲已而出於鬥爭、則全人類咸將感受痛苦、其結果如何、無人能料及之、特吾人所由奮鬥之故、不在距離寫遠的外國城市之政治前途如何、而欲伸張某種原則、此項原則若被摧毀、則全世界各國民族即永無和平之望、，好在大禍尙未降臨、理性與穩健的頭腦、仍有制勝之可能、數百萬人之生命、繫於担當責任者之行動、甚望彼輩痌療在抱、惻隱爲懐則善矣、吾國在此危急時期、已能精誠團結、（各議員咸大聲歡呼）、深信議員諸君定能以此旨昭示全世界也」云、（各義員又歡呼）、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>希特勒拒絕　英相勸告　接見英國大使　表示不變初哀</h3>
<p>柏林　漢德森大使在貝許德斯伽登鎭勾留半小時、可見其與希特勒元首晤談時間、必甚短促、殆僅十分鐘之譜、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　英國挽回戰刦之最後努力現已失敗、時局緊張刻迅速增劇、駐德英大使淡特森昨在貝許德斯加登晤見希特勒時、聞曾說明英政府之態度、即德蘇互不侵犯條約決不使英國對波蘭之義務稍受影饗是、昨夜德國官方通訊社發表一文、據稱希特勒已使英大使明了英政府所擔任之義務、不能使德國放棄其存亡所繫之權利云、希特勒此種答語、在德國政界中人觀之、認爲對英之一理警吿、在德國被迫防禦其爲國家生存所必要之利益時、英國不宜出而干涉、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　希特勒元首昨日在薩爾斯堡兩度接見英國大使漢德森爵士、第一决漢氏係向希氏提送張伯倫首相之函件、第二决漢氏係接受希氏之答覆、據消息靈通人士宣稱、張氏函中並無任何新意、其內容與英政府先一日所發申明、完全相同、至希氏答覆據德國新聞社宜稱、係闡明德國保護生存攸關權利之決心、決不受英國政府任何的束之影響、外交界人士相信、德國政府將不致變更其所持態度、巳絕無疑義、（二十四日海通電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福赫爾　兼程返華盛頓　再作呼籲和平</h3>
<p>華盛頓　據此間可靠方面消息、官方雖不信羅斯福總統將再爲和平作直接籲請、惟國務院顧問數人、現主張由羅總統電致義相墨案里尼、請運用其勢力、以阻止戰爭、又有若干方面相信、華盛頓將發表正式宣言、重申美國期望和平之志願、據可靠消息、現備總統返華盛頓時批閱之各種情報、其大旨爲「目前危局無法解脫」云、（二十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>紐約　總統福與國務卿赫爾均因歐局危急、中止休假、趕回華盛頓、羅總統可望於今日午後返華盛頓、據答覆新聞記者云、渠「深切關懐歐洲危局、政府若擬有所行動、渠不知爲何種行動云、總統府方面切實聲明、國務院雖吿總統、爲安全計、宜延至星期五日晨啟程返京、惟總統決計提早返京云、赫爾則稱、渠感覺必須「與迅速更變之國際情况、並駕齊驅、」英國駐美大使林德賽爵士、昨會與國務院帮辦韋爾士會談、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　國務院因歐洲有發生大戰之可能、昨晚特勸吿人民、勿再往歐洲遊歷、同時美國駐法駐波大使館亦勸告僑民、儘速離境、此間政府高級官員在二十四小時之內、會舉行二度會議、討論歐洲發生戰事時美國應取之步驟（二十四日美聯社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>蘇德新約內容與特徵之檢討</h3>
<p>「蘇聯與德意志兩國商訂互不侵犯條的，雖有遭遇種種疑難之可能，然不惟不流產，不難產，抑且必迅速完成，」今固不崇朝而完成矣。據柏林方面所公布，條的七條，全文具見本報本日新聞欄；其間最可注意者，抉誌如决：</p>
<p>第二條　簽字國一方倘被他國攻擊，則其他一方不得在任何方式之下，予攻擊國以援助；</p>
<p>第三條　簽字國雙方今後應就彼此有關之各項問題，保持接觸，並交換情報；</p>
<p>第四條　任何國際集團，凡不利於簽字國一方者，其他一方不得出而參加。</p>
<p>假定柏林所傳旣盡的文之精髓，則英法方面兩日來猶望條的內容，規定「訂的國之一方，對於第三國有何侵略行爲時，訂的國之他一方得宣吿廢的」、旣爲蘇德條的所未嘗限制，亦即訂的國若對第三國有何侵略行爲時，並不影響及於蘇德互不侵犯條的之存在。允如中國與蘇聯之互不侵犯條的（廿六年八月廿一日簽訂）第一條開宗明義，「兩方斥責以戰爭爲解決國際糾紛之方法，吾認以戰爭爲施行國家政策之工具」，凡此云云、蔚爲國際之和平原則者，亦爲蘇德條的所未嘗標舉，亦即戰爭行爲未嘗爲蘇德條的所貶斥。準此言之，蘇德兩國雖爲整個國際之一環，蘇德交惡雖爲大局危機之一端；然今茲成立之互不侵犯條的，固僅安頓此一環一端而已，謂於世界和平有何貢獻，有何裨補，則斷乎其不然。</p>
<p>蘇德互不侵犯條的別有其顯著之特徵焉：即一般互不侵犯條的之本質，輒屬消極防止而非有積極作爲，蘇德新的則未可作如是觀，此其一。一般條約之的束力量，輒限於方來而不溯旣往，（即如中蘇互不侵犯條的之第三條，即係若此規定，此外類例甚多，不勝舉）蘇德新的則有包舉過去未來之觀，此其二。何以證其特徵？蘇聯非與英法兩國擬訂三國政治協定軍事協定，久在談判之中乎？此其意義，曰反侵略，曰和平集團，曰專爲對付德國而巳。若不爲對德，所爲何來？德國與義大利別有軍事同盟條的，以英法爲假定敵，自當別論；此外非與日本西班牙訂有國際反共公的乎？此其意義，曰反共產主義，曰專爲對付蘇聯而已。若不爲對蘇，所爲何來？今於蘇德新的，旣以其第四條之規定，「任何國際集團，凡不利於簽字國一方者，其他一方不得出而參加」。此即喝止英法蘇三國談判之積極作爲也；易言之，蘇聯應以新的而放棄英法，以其不利於德國也。旣有第四條之規定，復無不溯旣往之明文，此即廢棄反共國際公的之積極作爲也；易言之，德國應以新的而放棄日本西班牙，以其不利於蘇聯也。此皆正當之界說，絕無別解，而成爲極可注意之特徵。顧乃蘇聯外交委員長猶溫慰英法駐蘇大使曰，三國談判無停頓之理由，又曰蘇德互不侵犯條的與英法蘇擬訂之互助條的，並不衝突云云；此誠滑稽之允，抑且嘲弄甚矣。無獨有偶，夫豈巧合，蓋同時德國當局之所以溫慰日本西班牙駐德大使者，亦曰反共公的乃屬思想性質，德國今茲所受蘇聯之的束，不致影響反共公的云；此其爲滑稽爲嘲弄，與蘇聯之告英法者有異曲同工之妙者也。言者殆微笑，聽者惟苦笑！</p>
<p>細細咀嚼蘇德互不侵犯條的之條文，蘇聯介於英法與德國之間，或別弄玄虛，尙有偸天換日之餘地，夫乃欲擒故縱之奇策歟？此以今决訂的所表示之根本政策言之，任何人更不必於條文之外，作何幻想。即就條文之字裏行間而求之；如第三條所規定之保持接觸與交換情報，此以正常之道德註釋之，求所以杜絕離間者也；交雖淺，言旣深，謂有擒縱之容心乎？又如第二條所規定，甲方被他國攻擊則乙方不得助他國；如此云云而試覓蹊徑，似乎甲方若攻擊他國，則乙方得不受條的拘束而猶得助他國；例以言之，德國攻波蘭，英法踐行諾言而援波，則蘇聯雖以不慊於波蘭而不爲波助，獨不可視此爲德國攻人，而蘇聯保有援英法之自由乎？唯唯，此其界說之權，屬之蘇聯；然德國固得號於世界曰，我誠以不得已而懲波蘭，顧未嘗損及英法毫髮，英法今則攻擊我矣！以今决蘇聯所表示之根本政策言之，蘇聯豈不將婉謝英法曰，君等攻擊德國，我有條的者，愛莫能爲君等助也。</p>
<p>云何蘇聯根本政策？曰蘇聯祇要德國放棄東進政策，放棄反共旗幟，根本不願參預英法德義之戰爭義此乃蘇聯自始迄今之政策，決非何種感情，何種手腕所得而搖撼之。英法與談判於莫斯科，是乃搖撼之嘗試；嘗試無效，非外交之罪也。</p>
<p>凡右所陳，根據柏林所傳蘇德互不侵犯條的之條款，主旨僅在乎檢討其內容。至於兩國新的成立之後，吾人所得展望於國際之新局勢者，容別爲文論之。</p>
<h3>德波法三國軍隊　紛紛調集邊境　波德邊境道路完全炸斷　柏林市區安設高射炮位　法波後備軍均奉令入伍</h3>
<p>比國京城　晚報頃載有歐本城來電、據稱德國軍隊業已開入邊境附近防禦工事之內、德國彼得根斯斐爾特區附近、載重汽車與重砲隊往來頻繁、萊茵省境內亦有大批軍隊調動情事、砲隊後備隊且已奉召入伍、至德國興盧森堡公國交界處所之常備軍業已撒退、而以後備軍代之云、（二十四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>柏林　此間自今晨起、即有高射砲隊士兵若干隊、在各軍略地點、允其是內閣各部署區域大厦屋頂、安放高射砲與高射機關槍、（二十四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>瑞士巴塞爾城　巴塞兩城新聞報頃載稱、「德國大批軍隊昨在巴登省與端士國交界處所集中、此項隊伍原在蘇台德區駐防其中多有奧地利省籍之士兵云、（二十四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>柏林　外傳波蘭國外長柏克上校、即將前往貝許德斯伽登鎭、訪問希特勒元首、此間波國大使館頃堅決予以吾認云、波國方面無一政治家將作貝許德斯伽登鎭之行、（二十四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>柏林　自今晨六時起至星期六日午後八時止、德國東部與東普魯士全境除軍團與政府飛機外、禁止飛機往來、東部界綫自波羅的海之格里夫斯華特起至紐勒賓及柏林以西三十五哩之白蘭登堡然後延至波希米亞與摩拉維亞保護省邊界、而繞克倫摩保護省經林資復入奧地利而止於義國邊界附近之維拉樞、至是該界綫復環繞整個德國邊境而回至波羅的海岸與格里夫斯華特、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　德國各報今日繼續以驚人標題、刊登波蘭軍事準備及波境反德恐怖活動之消息、據波蘭上西里西亞東部所來報吿、波德邊境之各道路、現已完全炸斷、鐵絲網及各種障礙物觸目皆是、邊境各村鎭、均爲波蘭軍隊所充斥、邊界沿綫並有隱藏森林中之觀察臺、隨時瞭望、（二十四日海通）</p>
<p>華沙　據聞政府當局頃所動員之後備兵、係屬一九一三·一九一四·一九一五年三級、此外、技術人員凡未奉令動員者、茲巳應召入伍、波國陸軍員額、因而提高至一百五十萬員名、（二十四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>華沙　法國政府旣已採取動員措置、波蘭國內閣亦於昨日午後與晚間十時、兩决舉行會議、决定依照國會前於本年六月間所通過之全權法、採取國防新措置、藉以適應國際時局之需要、全國壯丁之應動員者、業於昨晚與本日晨間用電報召集、至全國壯丁奉召入伍者、爲數究有若干、則因動員秘密之故、殊難加以査悉、但據一般估計、其數當有一百萬人之譜、此外、政府並已開始徵用汽車、經濟動員與工業動員、亦積極推進中、特民問日常生活尙未受有何項影響、亦未見有軍隊通過街衢、鐵路運輸、暢達如恒、京城允爲安謐、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華沙　一般民衆今日讀報載德國侵略行動之驚人消息、始了解目前危局之緊張、華沙四周昨晚軍隊調動終夜不息、雖總動員今尙未宣布、然官塲巳以佈吿文召集許多年級之新後備兵、（二十四日路透社電）</p>

<p>「河南方面」豫南我軍自上週一度克復長台關後速日繼續猛攻十八日再度攻入北關、斬獲頗鉅、另向駱駝店進擊之我軍、迫近信陽西關、以大砲攻城、戰况激烈、豫東通淮·太及·東縣之敵二千餘、經華軍連日不斷猛攻、敵顧此失彼、傷亡慘重、杞縣城仍被我包圍、奇兵一部，又乘勢攻抵蘭封車站、將敵軍火倉庫及兵營等盡行焚燬、現開封以東、敵隴海沿綫交通、已全都被我按制、豫北武陟·木樂店有敵數千餘名、連日向西竄犯甚猛、迭經迎頭痛擊、斃敵極衆、殘敵紛紛竄回原路、敵新鄕至安陽·修武間鐵路已被我澈底破壊、後路斷絕、恐慌巳極、又沁陽敵軍二十一日晨、經柏香鎮向我進犯、我軍適時出擊、將敵軍誘至官莊附近、包圍聚殲、敵棄屍三百餘具竄逃、現柏香鎭已無敵踪、</p>

<h3>匯價差額　計算標準</h3>

<h3>日機　轟炸高郵　似有報復作用</h3>
<p>泰縣通信、二十日上午十時、突有日轟炸機一架、飛高郵縣城上空、盤旋一週後、投擲炸彈兩枚、旋向正南方飛去、該兩彈盡落空處、地方尙無損失、窺日機轟炸目的、係因華軍連日猛攻昭關壩·邵伯各地、日軍屢受重創、乃以飛機投彈擾亂後方、藉資報復、但華軍士氣、並不因此稍綏、</p>
<h3>青角薄稻　運滬被扣　共五千餘包</h3>

<h3>天津被封鎖中　英國權益之檢討　譯自密勒氏評論報</h3>
<p>記者屬稿時、天律事件已成威望有關的問題、所牽涉的英國確實利益、反而沒人注意、包含着華北唯一的英租界而享有頒判權的天津、是該區中英國地位的磐石、也是華北重要的商業銷售中心地、集中在天津和四週的英國利益、佔多方面的活動、這在該城經營的若干主要英商行的名稱、可以表示、例如、開灤礦務總局·英美烟公司·匯豐銀行·麥加利銀行·亞細亞火汕公司·鄧祿普橡皮公司·卜內門洋碱公司。怡和公司。大古公司·天津安斯利出口公司·（譯音）和中國肥皂公司、據新近估計、在天津經營的英商行計一百十七家、資本在五萬元以上的九十八家、除這些私人組織之外、尙有英租界工部局的英國電氣公司、具有七千五百瓩的發電力、和具有每日給水的百萬介侖能力的水廠、一九三六年間、地皮捐收入、（也許在可課稅價値的百分之一左右）達法幣二五五·七四六元、租金捐達法幣四八七·六六二元、這可表示租界本身地產利息的大小、</p>
<p>英國在天津的重耍利益是貿易、目前戰事中發生的新因素、如重定沿海間貿易的路錢、封鎖其他口岸和物價高漲、結果所起的變化、目下不能準確計算、但可獲得的價値統計表、實足表示現時天津對英國貿易的重要、也可作爲跟戰前局勢相比較的基礎、天津口岸的英國船雙、本佔首位、一九三八年被日本船隻所奪、而今降居第二位、去年出入天津的英國船隻總噸位是一·七六三·四六一噸、其中沿海航船佔一·三五五·七〇六噸、但這總數較一九三七年增加二九九·四六一噸、比一九三六年也多四九·二三〇噸、</p>
<p>同樣的、在此决戰事中、天津對英輸出的總値並沒低落、反而自一九三六年的法幣一〇·三七九·八四〇元增到一九三八年的一一·七三八·五二〇元、但同期中天津對日輸出値、已自法幣二八·四四〇·四一〇元增到七八·二一〇·七八五元、（對美輸出値自法幣四四·二八五·〇一七元降至三一·二五七·五四一元）一九三八年、天津對英重要輸出品是牲畜和牲畜產物、多半是鬃·蛋·和蛋製物·（法幣七·〇二九·七七〇元）、獸皮·皮革·和皮貨·（法幣四七八·五一三元）、種子、多半是杏仁（法幣五一三·四七五元）、以及紡織纖維和產物、多半是羊毛、（法幣二·九二八·四七〇元）</p>
<p>戰事對於這貿易已有不同的影響、獸皮·皮革、和皮貨·種子·紡織纖維和產物·以及鬃、在一九三六到三八年間都低落了、只種子一項、已從一九三七年的地位恢復過來、對於英國利益最嚴重的、是羊毛出口的低落、這大半是日人壟斷羊毛的結果、然而牲畜和牲畜產物、允其是蛋和蛋類產物出口的增加、已足抵銷這收損失而有餘了、</p>
<p>一九三八年輸入天津的英貨達三·五三八·五三五金單位、（一金單位等於未跌價時的法幣二元二角六分或美金約六角八分）一九三七年是三·五三九·八四九金單位、一九三六年是二·八五一·二三五金單位、稍有增加、日貨的輸入、却自一九三六年的一一·九九二·一五一金單位、增到一九三八年的五四·四三六·〇一八金單位、同期間美貨輸入的增加、沒有日貨增加得迅速、計自三·九二六·五六五金單位、增到九·一五八·五一〇金單位、一九三八年輸入天津的英貨、最重要的項目、是白色和染色的棉布、（六五·五五六金單位）羊毛和羊毛製物、（三九九·六〇八金單位）金屬和礦砂、（九五五·五六七金單位）車輛和船隻、（一二二·八五三金單位）金屬製雜貨、（一〇一·三〇一金單位）化學物品和製藥品、（七二三·九四〇金單位）染料顏料和油漆、（五八·五一七金單位）以及書籍地圖紙張和木漿、（四六·三六〇金單位）</p>
<p>羊毛和羊毛製品·染料·顏料·和油漆·書籍地圖·紙張·和木漿、都銳减、而金屬和礦砂·以及化學物和製藥物却激增、其他許多較欠重要的項目中——如烟·酒·啤酒·火酒·燭·皂·火油·脂肪·臘·樹膠·樹脂·和皮革——數額雖較小、但都大增、</p>
<p>日人樹立龍斷出口禁止、外匯統制條例、修正稅率、使有利日方產物、對鐵路便利的給予加以歧視、和電報業務的不足、這些行動、結果雖使英國利益受困擾和傷害、然而天津的英國商業地位、直到新近的危局爲止、還是堅强的成脅租界本身存在的封鎖、對於英國利益、是無可比擬的大危險、</p>
<h3>日軍揚言威脅　香港能堅守九個月　英軍官之表示</h3>

<p>同時、聞東旭萊隊英兵咋夜沿西區邊界一帶駐防、據負責方面解釋、此等軍隊、僅係戒備、彼等在西區活動、實無異常之處云、昨日午後、謠傳日慧兵已開始在界外馬路巡邏云云、已由警務方面加以吾認、惟承認界外馬路上昨日確有日憲兵出現、僅係裝價電話錢、</p>

<p>缺米原因日方觀察</p>
<p>大陸報云、華中日軍報道班長馬淵大佐昨（二十三日）在招待新聞記者席上宣稱、公共租界當局對本市米糧問　、若不能覔得解決、則將爲日人接血辦理之時矣」，如公共租界官憲不能或拒絕出此、致發生或將擾亂上海及近郊的和平與秩序之暴動、則日當局感覺勢必採取適當辦法、解決米糧問題「所謂米糧短缺」、日當局頗爲扼腕　然渠疑惑「短缺」　辭、是吾完全正確、為淵續稱、實則並無此種短缺情事、因投機者甚至工部局當局、恒囤大量米糧也、米價極高，旣造成危害、渠意爲自己利益而出此可訝手段之工部局當局與商人、咸應解決此問題云、</p>

<h3>一封公開的信（上）</h3>
<p>— 黃炎培</p>
<p>我離開淞滬二十一個月中間，倒有十八個月在前方後方各地奔走，一年以來，足跡徧在後方，請把最近親見親聞的事實，向諸君擇要說來。</p>
<p>到處最使人極度感奮的，就是民衆，抗戰到兩年以上，走徧後方各地，從沒有聽到民衆對於久戰，對於苦戰，有半句怨言。無論徵發民衆的財力也好，體力也好，除非沒有說得明白，如果說明爲的是抗戰，任何犧牲，絕對沒有反響。最近我在××地方，參觀飛機塲建築工程，五千多民工，並沒有經過多少時間的訓練，就爲是主辦人一塲演說，說明航空建築，對於抗戰關係的緊密，貢獻的偉大，全部民工興奮到了不得。開工時間沒有到，便來了；到了停工時間，還不去，七十天的限期，不滿六十天便完了。那天我站在高台上講話，祇是講了幾句刺激大衆神經的話，——諸君，你們天天肩頭上挑運着的土，一鏟一鏟挖掘出來的土，脚底下所踐踏着的土，是什麽士呢？諸君記着，這是中華民國的國土呀，也就是我們幾百萬將士和幾千萬同胞，所不惜拚着血和肉去保守的土呀！諸君珍珠般的汗，滴在這光明燦斕的國土上，是何等榮耀！——話未說完，全塲五千民衆，突然發出懽呼的大聲，像瘋在一般。在內地，在邊疆，尙且這樣，還不够表現我一般民衆抗戰情緒的熱烈嗎？</p>
<p>允其表現得明顯的，要算靑年，旅行到着的地方，任何鄕鎭，差不多總會碰到從軍的學生，並且都是志願投效的。訪問他們的家屬，讀他們從軍隊裏寄歸的家書，種種表示，旣盡忠，又盡孝，如果是人，沒有不感動到眼淚直淌下來。我只想到今後做人的標準提高了，像我們這種做人，祇有慚愧！（試讀我近作「從內地視察親收得民衆熱烈愛國的事實」（國訊二〇九期）在抗戰初期，表現最早的，耍算廣西，現在幾乎普及各地了。在抗戰初期，靑年志願從軍的，對於家長，還不免秘秘密密地瞞着去幹，現在家長心理，也改變了。我在長江上游某地點慰問軍人家屬，遇着一位小英雄尙彬儒的母親，問：彬儒投軍，你倒沒有阻止？答：他替國家出力，怎麼好阻止呢。在××地方，有位劉太太，他的兒子，沒有吿訴母親，自動的投入志願兵的隊伍，他的母親，無意中碰見兒子，加在大隊裏游行，問旁人是什麽一回事？答他們去打日人的，劉老太太大大的興奮，買了幾尺紅綢，親手向他兒子背上披着，自己跟着走，哄動了一地方整個社會，當做一椿佳話，像這類事，一時竟說不盡。</p>
<p>近一年來，民衆能力之表現，在前方允爲充分。誰都知道，鄂北豫南一帶，豫北晋南一帶，就爲是民衆和軍隊合作得極度親切，雙方力量配合得極度和諧，因而結出偉大的成果，使日人無法進展，前進一决，倒退一决，這固然是軍隊作戰的神勇，然而民衆「與有力焉」。今後日騎所到地方，大槪都是民衆表現力最的機會</p>
<p>至於政治，我敢說，在主持抗戰建國最高領袖指導之下，總是一步步望着改進途徑上走。抗戰以來，在最艱苦最危險中間，服務精神最是出色表現的，要算鐵路郵政等幾個部分。最近我在西南邊地旅行，有地名二把傘」眞當得起「鄉僻」二字，恰巧發見一郵政箱，我旣愛這地名稱的別致，又想試一試郵政的成績，我寫了幾張明信片，從一把傘寄到某某等地，並各要求答覆，旣而一處一處覆信，居然收到，我不能不嘆郵政組織確是嚴密。我回渝市，恰値運日空襲，防空組織，確比從前大有進步，渝市設有緊急救濟聯合辨事處，市民依他的指道，一聞警報，用敏捷而有秩序的舉動，差不多全體隱藏起來；而允其可敬的，一班服務隊，消防隊，奮勇冒險，搶先救護，辦事處總幹事，每决親自臨塲指揮，一個燒夷彈落地未及爆發，一刹那間，把沙土蓋上，便不會燒夷，一箇汽車公司，隣居被炸，藏有多量汽油，於一刹那間，安然搶出，都是他們奮男冒險的成績。有一决總幹事壓在坍屋之下，居然無恙，這都是吾親見親聞的事實。（未完）</p>
<h3>國際形勢急轉　公債奔騰飛漲　日德鈔票慘跌蘇幣反漲　金市小回外僑換購所致</h3>
<p>自德蘇簽訂互不侵犯協定、國際形勢改觀後、金融市塲、頓現活潑、統一公債於前午起、即奔騰馳漲、由一元零五分起一元半止、迨至昨晨、各報登載德外長巳赴莫斯科正式簽該項協定、本市證券暗市、以我國際形勢急轉、向有利方面邁進、復以我國對日作戰地帶、迭據電傳勝利、於是市塲人心、允爲堅定、故統一公債行情、繼續奔騰上漲、上午甲種爲五十元零八角、乙種則十四元六角、丙種四十二元三角五分、丁種四十一元四角、戊種四十一元八角五分、總較前日再漲起五六角不等、下午市况各種均稍退無幾、據測日內將仍步趨上漲、</p>

<p>德日鈔票均告狂跌</p>
<p>德國金票（即馬克票）在侵捷成功後、曾一再升漲不已、今以該國對波蘭採取積極行動、以致該金票金鎊、驟吿在跌、昨日德金票祇有一元一角、較前日再跌三角半有奇、較上週已跌七角有餘、金鎊祇有九十元、較以前跌小甚多、日本老頭票前昨均在跌、祗有一元一角左右、較上週看小三四角之多、至於蘇聯金鎊、則反漲至九十六元、金票漲爲四角左右、</p>

<h3>金融　七國呼籲和平　黃金漲風東山再起　最高曾到四千二百元　交易繁旺二千兩左右</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、因塲內空氣忽緊忽馳、致市勢仍飄忽靡常、大致先跌而后暴漲、初開承隔昨晚收後之餘風、且某金號哪胃較健、致仍抬至四千〇四十元開盤、但不旋踵因受外匯鬆動之影響、甲乙銀樓幫套賣頗力、價遂一度傾斜至三千九百元低盤、嗣以外匯回平、激動買風、某金號代投機商吸收甚力、兼港帮亦來搜購、故價遂反動向上、飛漲至四千〇九十五元、午刻復稍下措、延至午收爲四千〇六十五元、午後初時因銀樓幫三多等爭先塞出、致又推入四千元大關、達三千九百七十元、入後因七國呼籲和平、已有端倪之消息、且外匯轉緊、人心頓轉向榮、外行及津港兩帮與投機商均紛託塲中之流動掮客猛進、再加售者頗少、遂又飛騰至四千二百元高峯、惟結果以四千一百七十元收盤、較上日回漲二百〇五元、交易暢旺、達二十元光景、銀樓飾金亦隨之起落不定、終則掛高二十元、海關金與中英純金等均無變化、</p>
<p>烚赤回起二〇五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開雖外匯晨開略鬆、但因某金號頗有吃胃、故晨開與隔昨晚收無甚上落、但較上日晚收價做高七十五元、某金號進銀樓帮二十兩、爲四千〇四十元、開後各銀樓門市收貨頗多、致頻來套賣、且外匯市勢績硬、趨勢遂向下瀉、不久即傾跌一百四十元、錢兌業塞予某銀號十兩、爲三千九百元、十時半後聞外匯逐漸回平、買風頓强、某金號與港帮競相吸收、兼某錢兌業納胃亦健、遂反動直上、竟飛漲一百九十五元、金號進銀樓帮二十兩、爲四千〇九十五元、時已午刻、後錢兌業獲利復出、立見回挫三十元、錢兌業賣予金號二十兩、爲四千〇六十五元、作午收價、收後因某金號復來猛扒、價竟抬高至四千一百二十元、午後因銀樓帮復來猛塞、且散戶亦跟踪拋出、致市熱復見回下、開市比午收做低三十五元、銀樓帮售予錢兌業二十兩、爲四千〇三十元、開後買風仍盛、不久又回入四十元關內、錢兌業賣予金號十兩、爲三千九百七十元、此後某金號又起買風、且外匯轉緊、故某銀號（代外行）與證券帮及某銀樓代客競相吸收、致市價立即反動猛漲、竟於買風籠罩下、飛躍二百三十元、錢兌業進金號三十兩、爲四千二百元、入後銀樓幫吐予金號二十兩、爲四千一百七十元、作晚收價、結果比上日回漲二百〇五元、聞收後港幫仍有納胃、價又抬高至四千一百九十元、全天三百元上落、現金號之本牌金照烚赤較高十元、現標金照掛牌金低六十五元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>首飾金掛高二十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百元、迨至九時二十五分掛高五元、逾二十五分回小五兀、十一時三十分又掛大五元、逾十分後叉高五元、下午二時三十五分再掛大五元、三時又掛高五元、結果掛高二十元、計大同行改懸四百二十元、新同行爲四百十八元、收進的减低二十元光景、</p>
<p>中英純金均不變動</p>
<p>二十日倫敦電、英純金未更、每盎斯仍爲七鎊八先令六辦士半、致中央銀行之各行市價亦隨之不變、</p>
<h3>投機意向轉變　出英金進美匯</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、滙豐掛牌揭曉、悉無變更、英美匯暗市情勢、因時局恍惚、人心捉摸不定、故先鬆而後突緊、晨開略帶鬆硬、鎭因香港續電拋塞兼華商勇猛大量吐出英金、但英行匯豐陸續吸收、且英商沙遜亦有納胃、致鬆勢緩和、惟一度英金曾硬至三辦士八一二五、美匯亦曾鬆至七元四三七五、嗣以沙遜復來扒結、且華商轉扒九月期美匯甚力、政爲狀逐步回平、延至午收、已與晨開相埒、午後因市上聞有七國同盟斡旋和平消息、故一般以爲歐局或有一綫曙光、是以華商等遂續扒購現期美匯、且匯豐對於英金吃胄仍健、故市象遂轉趨緊軟、結果以英金三辦士五九三七五美匯七元收盤、本月期貨趨勢興現貨仍形相似、九月份期貨、因世界局勢突變、交戰國當然有其風險、故咸抱售英鎊買進美元熊度、結果因之美較英允緊、</p>
<p>沙遜華商轉賣爲買</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦人條近爲均縮三七五、紐約銀價小半分、倫敎生金未更、匯兌英對美不動、對滬長一八七五、對法小一生了、美對英仍平、對滬漲四角一分、對法大零六二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士七一八七五、美匯七元二五、校之前收、英鬆零三一二五、美硬零六二五、開後港電輿投機商續來猛塞、允以英金更湧、但匯豐吃胃尙佳、兼沙遜亦扒現貨先令、故鬆勢尙綏、計沙遜吸進外行現貨英金三辦士七一八七五、繼而港電與華商相繼塞予匯豐有利等英行現貨英金三辦士七五及八一二五、繼叉吐予美行現貨美匯七元三一二五及四三七五、迨匯豐掛脾揭曉、悉無上落、及白銀平衡稅揭曉依然免微、此後西商沙遜與洋行等扒進外行及華行現貨英金三辦士七五、並叉結進外行現貨美匯七元三七五、是以過程漸平、後一般華商力扒港電及外行九月份美匯六元七五及六二五、故期貨市勢帶緊、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金三辦士七一八七五、美酒七元二五、均與最開無異、</p>
<p>九月期貨美緊於英</p>
<p>後市因西商沙遜復來吸收現貨縣令、日華商力扒現期美酒、致由勢遂轉軟化、首由沙遜吸進外行現貨英金三辦士六五六二五及六二五、繼之華商扒進某行等現貨美匯七元一五六二五及一二五、時華商又來結進外行九月份美匯六元四三七五及三七五、入後華商又購進某行現貨美匯七元、延至晚收銀行現貨賣價、英金三辦士五九三七五、美滙七元、本月份英金三辦十五七八一二五、美滙六元九六八七五、九月份英金三辦士三一二五、美滙六元三一二五、結果比上日現貨與本月英回緊零九三七五、美回軟一八七五、九月份英貴一二五、美縮三七五、</p>
<p>香港申滙升十二元</p>
<p>香港二十四日電、今日滙市開盤堅穩、英美日各滙不動、申滙微降一元、爲三百八十五元、十時二十分、申匯續降十元、爲三百七十五元、十一時三十分申滙回升五元、爲三百八十元、午收申滙續升六元、爲三百八十六元、下午二時三十分、平穩無榮辱、三時三十分收盤、行情轉軟、英匯現貨不動、遠期緊零三一二五、爲一先令二便士五六二五、美匯現貨縮零六二五、爲二十八元三七五、遠期未開出、申匯再升十二元、爲三百九十八元、全日申匯上落二十三元、結果比升十二元、</p>
<h3>外幣回漲</h3>
<p>昨日外幣、因外匯午後回緊、烚赤回漲亦烈、英美金鎊堅挺上升、英美金票客戶趁低吸收、亦趨昂貴、香港票先鬆後緊、結果微升、法郞票供求稀少、尙形穩定、新加坡票軟弱微降、荷蘭票有需要微升、坎拿大斐律濱票、因美金票堅昂、追隨上升、德金票需要不旺、且爲歐局震盪中、激降頗多、澳金票跟隨英余票而升、日金票亦回昂、晚市爲一元一角六、朝鮮票微升、晚市爲九角九分五厘、昨日市價、英金鎊升三元、英金票升五角、美金鎊升四元、美金票升四角、香港票升二角、新加坡票降一角、荷蘭票升一角、坎拿大票升四角、斐律濱票升二角、德金票降三角五分、澳金票升一元、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>貼現再度下落</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、再度下落、每千元初即低至一百八十元弱、繼更步低至午刻爲一百七十二元半、下午供求平淡、價仍站一百七十二元五角、比前日又低十元、錢業公會拆息行市、早午兩市仍開一角七分未更云、</p>
<h3>美銀回小　英印隨之下降</h3>
<p>二十三日倫教電、銀市印度賣出、投機家在步跌時買進、市面尙平、收盤後、情勢更軟、少數交易照掛睥價低〇六二五、大條銀、近遠期均回縮三七五、紐約銀電、美現貨回小半分、又孟買銀電、印銀市况疲軟、現貨跌六安那期貨均降七安那、成交單祇二十五張云、</p>
<h3>證劵　債市恍惚　多頭不斷出籠　市價漲勢受挫</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况漲風尙有餘威、惟以多方不斷出籠、人心又路起恍惚、市價亦稍稍受挫、自德蘇化仇爲友後、前途尙有不可逆測之變化、債市自有共相當間接利害關係、此遂爲做多做空討論之焦點、聚訟紛紜、殊難得其邏輯之結論、故多數仍隨市氣爲轉移、得利即結、無久遠思想、市價在此震盪波動中、不易趨入正軌、昨日交易頓見减少、趨勢先則由低而高、復山高而疲、買賣雙方並未見繼績興奮、買方祇十四及十五號以及大豐稍有進胃、四十一號仍係賣出、聯和同康亦有傾吐、市價結果仍好起四六角、收盤後外匯又緊、金子又漲、債市乃又下降三四角、成交總數的共一百萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票市况、紗布交易所股價三十六元、成交一百股、</p>
<p>叉上海衆業公所報吿云、股市交易稀少、價格波動不大、午後雖係下週新交易登塲之時、興趣仍感缺乏、交易者鑒於歐洲形勢、對於新的買賣、似無參加意向、</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠束各公司股票、本月二十三日（週三）掛牌行市、稍見穩定、滙豐銀行英倫註冊股回升一鎊、爲六十六鎊、又香港註冊股降落半鎊、價爲六十八鎊、仍爲有行無市、古拉客林傍橡皮股回升一先令三便士、價爲十七先令六便士、餘無變動、</p>
<p>倫敦中國外債本月二十三日（週三）掛牌行市、稍見軟落、善後英發跌一鎊、價爲二十六鎊、津浦原發（英發）跌半鎊、價爲十一鎊半、京滬路債來電稱跌至八鎊半、計跌四鎊半、恐係電碼錯誤、有待後證、其餘各種仍吿不動、</p>
<h3>紗花　囤戶恐慌斬結　紗價一蹶不振　—雙馬再寫五十元—</h3>
<p>土日在落之紗市、今則續趨下挫、且跌風再接再厲、蓋以環境惡劣、外匯轉長、昔日不顧一切之囤戶、目前視歐洲戰雲瀰漫、大有一觸即發之勢、於是人心恍惚不定、一般小戶浮多、處此情形之下、忍痛斬結、一時籌碼過剩、紗價乃一蹶不振矣、二十支雙馬外棧貨打破七百元關口、棧單價跌破六百元關門、現貨雙馬價爲六百五十元、比上日再在瀉五十元之譜、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、承上日至餘氣、二十支雙馬棧單價續跌二十一元、價爲五百八十五元、但現貨問詢者寥落、少頃有一部份心意謂下跌程度殊深、搶回風者忽然而起、不到一刻時漲升而十五元、出六百元關、價做到六百十元、旋聞外匯放長、而同時不良消息接踵而來、形勢驟變、賣者蜂擁、喊賣聲震動戶外、一霎間猛降四五十元之巨、二十支雙馬棧價爲五百七十四元、現貨爲六百五十元、收盤平平、查半日間成交統計九百五十包、行情二十支雙馬跌五十元、雙地球跌三十元、天女跌四十元、牧羊跌二十四元、查棉紗今日有卅件運往天津、五十件運香港、八十件運海防、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<h3>紗價慘落　棉銷停頓</h3>
<p>中外現棉交易一比未有成交、但人心稍有參差不一，廠方鑒於棉紗慘落、且跌風兇猛、對於採辦原料心意渙散、至於棉商方面、外匯雖則放長、然換算價廉宜不多、且存棉日見匱乏、售意未懈、於此雙方遂呈擯持之局、茲據某掮客云、同葉中進惠司登一百件、價爲一百四十元、比上日價短疲三元、蘇北來源僅到通花五十包、上日各方售開價係跌十元、誤載漲十允、附此訂正、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、咋日匯兌已轉入堅定狀態、然紗價因受國戶之恐慌、猛力塞出、因之紗價慘落、原棉售價、因同業中心意頗堅、售意淡薄、暫時不擬康售、因之交易較爲靜寂也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初尙稱堅定、後因歐洲局勢危急、紐的證券慘跌、人心浮動、多頭者均獲利了結、市價因之下降、收盤時較之上日跌十餘磅音、印度連同預測跌二羅比、埃及漲四五磅音、</p>
<h3>定頭　歐局緊迫　囤戶傾賣　客銷觀望　售盤猛瀉　國布</h3>
<p>昨以歐局風雲緊迫人心浮動、囤戶傾向賣出、粵港等市帮手貨亦多貶價轉售、買戶畏縮、成交銳退、市盤跌勢猛烈、明盤與暗盤相差竟達五角之巨、本街批發號銷出、門市店及江浙內地長江中下游各埠辦去色布色斜錢呢印花布絨布二千數百疋、本客帮楚額進貨多抱觀望態度、小額仍續有採辦、市盤細布細斜每疋續跌二角至五角、組布跌一角至五角、色布綫呢嗶嘰跌每疋三五角不等、印花貨平定、</p>
<p>東定</p>
<p>晨市賣氣仍盛、市盤又告猛跌、龍頭細布最低降至十七元二角、五福細布降至十五元五角、天津帮及色布號均有賣出、惟旋以龍頭此價較上週九月份期貨行盤相差已達二元八角之巨、故市上又有乘廉收進之舉、售盤叉吿回漲、結果龍頭價十七元七八角、全日成交細布細斜六七百包、嗶嘰直貢每疋亦續降一二四角、</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>今日有定投五件、運往香港、又二百十件、運海防、十二件運烟台、二十件運天津、</p>
<h3>糧食　防生意外　米店少進　客秈回落三五角　鮮粳尚開四十元</h3>
<p>杜米　近來米價騰貴、一般米舖有出售四十二三元之高價、致貧民無以爲生、激成搶米風潮、日有二三起、昨同孚路某米棧、亦險遭搶刦、幸捕房聞訊趕到、未成事實、故店方咸具戒心、鮮有進辦、且昨日各路共到河下貨松江南港帮十四船、楓涇車輪包子一千四五百包、嘉興嘉善及崑山等新尖二千餘包、此外蕪湖新尖亦有抵埠、惟陳尖爲數有限、人心略平、計做開鮮錫粳四十元、高錫粳三十九元、常州鮮粳三十九元半、蘇同崑粳三十八元半至三十八元、松江及南港松隱等早晚稻河下貨開三十五六元、原包三十八元、嘉善嘉興新尖三十四元、崑山新川尖三十四元半、蕪湖新早尖三十四元、高陳蕪尖三十六元至三十五元、無錫變兀三十一元、丹陽變元三十元、成交數共計八千餘包、</p>
<p>客秈　昨日買氣轉淡、全日成交祇二千餘包、因行囤已無新胃、而店舖亦防意外、不敢多辦、且各路新秈相繼到市、今後新米尙可源源來申、前到蕪秈已有一部份駁出、故價已回落三五角、高蕪秈三十五元半至三十四元、中决不一、</p>
<p>洋米　交易沉寂、惟聞各團體商行工廠均在設法自定中、祇陳小絞開出二百包、價三十四元、新西貢未開、</p>
<h3>麵粉漲風漸戢　麥價亦見回鬆</h3>

<h3>時事速寫　搶米者</h3>
<p>— 柳星火</p>
<p>是孤島的一角。是在一條陋巷中。是在一間破舊的房間里。昏黃的煤油燈光，跟睡在床板上的孩子的臉色一樣可怕。伏在旁邊的母親巳爲百般哄騙孩子而顯得精力疲竭，游絲一般的聱息尚在延续地吐流着。</p>
<p>「媽…！媽……我餓……」</p>
<p>「……别嚷……　會……爸爸來啦！燒飯吃……」</p>
<p>當微弱的聲音快被寂寞吞蚀的時候，突然，一個漢子像發瘋似的從外面闖進來，他氣喘地嚷著：［不是我！不是我！」踉蹌地伏到桌子上去。在煤油燈光下，可以看出他的灰白的臉色。</p>
<p>「爸爸！……孩子哭啦」</p>
<p>那婦人驚訝的從床沿上跳起來：「你……爲什麼？……」</p>
<p>你……先到外邊去看看，有沒有巡捕……」</p>
<p>婦人朝門外張了一張，陋巷中寂靜得沒有一們鬼影子，她開始顫抖起來：「沒有什麼！你……闖了什麼亂子嗎？」</p>
<p>「沒有，沒有。」漢子的氣喘逐漸平靜下來。</p>
<p>「你的米……沒有貿到米嗎？」</p>
<p>「呵！你快別說。」他似乎聽到米字而惶急起來。「米，是的，我沒有買到。不！不！我沒有買……我跑到米店時，那里正擠滿了一大批人，他們噪噪鬧鬧的，好像在噪嘴，我也就擠上前去。不知道是誰喊了一聲搶，大家就一股腦兒的擁了進去，我也在人堆里被軋進了店堂，他們都像老虎一樣的把堆在那里的米和麵粉揹了就走。我想起了你，想起我的孩子，今天還沒有吃過一點東西；我也就從地上揹起一袋米……」</p>
<p>「什麼？你也搶米……不！不！你一定說錯啦！」她十二分緊張的地：「你的米呢？……」</p>
<p>「我揹起一袋米，突然，一陣苦惱從胸上湧起來，我爲什磨要搶米呢？米不斷的漲價難道全是米店不好嗎？搶米是一個永久的辦法碼？造成上海這樣混亂情形的人又是誰呢？…………正在我胡亂地想著的時候，我聽到有人喊：「巡捕來啦！」我就慌慌忙忙的逃了出來，肩頭上的米也早不知到什麼地方去了……」</p>
<p>「那磨，沒有米……」她有點垂頭喪氣。「可是，我們還熬得起餓，孩子却受不了啊！我的苦命的孩子……」她關切地望了一下孩子，那孩子巳疲倦得睡丟了。</p>
<p>「是的，我們這樣挨下去，也許會有一天餓死的。」他的臉上交織著苦悶，煩惱，憤怒。但，過一回，他的眼睛亮起來，像是在冒著火：「不！我決不願意在這里活活的餓死，要死，也得找一條有價值的死路。」</p>
<p>煤油燃乾了，黑暗在燈光搖動後到來。讓皎潔的月光照亮了這死寂的房問，燃著了年青人胸中的怒火！</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十五回　海外豓聞忽迎桃葉火中奇景竟桀蓮花</p>
<p>愛麗絲也如道姑母的話，不免過甚其詞，然而這些話也不能說它是全無影響。這位姑母雖然守舊頑國，但是勸她不要嫁中國人，也出於她的誠意。就是除了姑母以外，別的人也未必贊顧，愛麗絲心中也猶夷不定。不想中國人說的「姻緣雞宇，婚姻真是有所謂天緣來湊合的，倘然真有緣分，便是要拆也拆不散的。大概愛麗絲與成功，合有姻緣之分，冥冥中便有主宰，是教一個白種女子要嫁一位黃種丈夫了吧。這一天，愛麗絲家裹忽然發生事故來了。原來歐美人，每喜歡住一種高房子，尤其是在那種都市之問。高房子最多而目最高的，要算是美國的紐約，甚而至於一座房子，有了一百多層。紐約人的造高房子，却有了競爭心，一有了這競爭心，可就不得了。譬如你造了座一百層的大樓，明天他便造一座一百零五層的大樓，他比你多了五層，便可以打破你的紀錄。明天還有一個人，却不服氣，他偏生要造一座一百一十層的大樓，你這一百零五層的紀錄，又被他打破了。倘然市當局不加以一個限制，繼長增高，就要永無窮期。現在我們說的法國，就沒有那種極高房子，可是五六層的樓房，那就無足爲奇。愛麗絲所住的房子，是一座五層大樓，是公寓式的，他們呼之爲阿派脫門。愛麗絲家中，有很富麗的房子，不過是在鄉村間，距市較遠。却因然愛麗絲要在里昂大學肄業，所以離學校不遠，就借住在這個公寓裹。好在她們只有母女二人，不必要怎樣的大屋子，而這個公寓中，裝修頗爲精緻，設備也很完全，樓下還有花園草地網球塲之類。當然，愛麗絲的男女同學，都曾去過，成功也曾去過不知有多少回了。愛麗絲母女取其高敞，就住在第五層樓上，此下有電梯升降，很爲便利。第五層樓上，有上家人家居住，每一家也有四五間屋子，有起居室，有臥房，有餐室，有浴室等等。愛麗絲還有一間漂亮的讀書室，同學們也都去過。讀書室的隔壁，就是愛麗絲的臥房，雖熱房間是不大，却收拾得十分精緻，這也是男女同學們所大家知道的。（一七三）</p>
<h3>利用舊教科書</h3>
<p>— 安然</p>
<p>各書局對於教科書，已經漲價了；中學的漲五成，小學的漲八成。有人也許以爲各書局存心不良，想在這百物漲價聲中，撈上一筆。然而我們略加調查，就可以知道各書局也有牠們不得已的苦衷。別的不要說，就只是紙張一項，從前二三塊錢一令，現在却已漲到十幾元一令了，一令不過五百張，那末教科書的成本漲了多少，也就可想而知了。所以現在，我們除了希望各書局不會再漲價以外，對於學生必須備就的教科書，還常另想別法來補救才是。</p>
<p>補救方法中最好的，自然是利用舊教科書。聽說光華附中的女同學會，已在發起這一個運動了，她們已在發出通函給各同學，請大家將用過的舊教科書，交出來，並請說明每冊耍賣多少，而賣出後願意捐助難民多少。這一個辦法，我認爲實在目前孤島上各校學生當務之急，希望各校在這開學的時候，都會起而仿傚。</p>
<p>這樣的利用舊教科書，自然可以獲得下列各種公益：（一）不必多爲洋紙添出路，我想各書局就兌少做生意，少賺些錢，總也是願意的：（二）廢物利用，節約物力，使本來用過就置之高閣，或棄之一隅的教料書，還能夠盡其最後的用塲，不致暴殄天物：（三）使學生的負担減輕，穩定整個社會經濟，因爲賣舊書的，既然略有所得，不無小補，而買舊書的，出小量的余錢，獲同樣的應用，就更加節省不少了。</p>
<p>我所希望的，不但中學如此，大學也如此，而小學尤其非如此不可！因爲小學教科書漲得最多，而小學生的家長，大都是中下等家庭，在這種生活壓迫之下，經濟最爲困難。但小學生還沒有自動組緻以謀自身福利的能力，所以我尤其希望各小學校的教職員，肯起來主持暈事。一些自私自利的小學校當局，如果還像去年一樣，一定要呌學生買他所經手販來的新教科書，新練習簿，舊的或其他代用品絕對不准用，那當然是應該受與論的指斥的，希望這一個學期，不會再發見！（編者按：現南中同學已組識一個［藝書買賣委員會」，先各校推行。）</p>
<h3>藝苑之花</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>“Drarmatie　School”</p>
<p>米高梅公司出品　國泰大戲院映</p>
<p>露慧雷納底卓越的演技，是由刻苦，磨練中得來的。</p>
<p>「大地」中的王龍之妻，慈祥，耐勞，忠於丈夫，寄託希望於子女，她把阿蘭這腳色，絲予我們一個活生生的形象。在「藝苑之花」巾，她又担任了那樣艱難的一個角色：是一個忠於藝術，而欲　做夜工所得來資助學費的貧家女，她幻想著一惆美麗的世界，她憧憬著一惆美貌的情人，在工廠中遇見了侯爵之後，在她底心的深處播種下美麗的種子，她滿意地希望它能開出奇異的花卉來。但是侯爵的見愛思遷，給了她一個嚴重的打擊，她底戀愛的美夢幻滅了。在另一方面，她却發展了她底藝術的天才，當她一舉成名，獲得良心上的安慰的時候，她拒絕了侯爵的愛情，而決心獻身於藝衍。</p>
<p>露　　納演來，從憧憬，幻滅而成功，她都能堅強地把握住情感的變遷而刻劃了這腳色的性格。尤其是以下的幾個例，演得更深刻動人。她在工廠里初次遇見候爵時候的甜蜜的幻想；回同學捏造與侯爵偕游的眉飛　舞；侯爵出現時的始而驚愕，繼而受寵若驚；在夜總會見侯爵另戀一舞女而憤然離別；及最後表演成功，衷心歡欣之狀，她都能運用面部及眼睛的表情，來傳達心理的變化，演技之神化，歎爲觀止。</p>
<p>導演者描繪戲劇學校的空氣，很見活潑。如每個學生的希望，及練習「羅密歐告朱麗葉」時的形形色色，戲劇色彩非常濃厚。就是全片的發展太平穩，不夠緊湊，那是因爲導演者集中在露　雷納身上，其他幾個所要描寫的人物都忽略了的綠故。因之，寶蓮高達和亞倫馬歇爾都沒有成績可言。</p>

<h3>泰羅鮑華與安娜蓓拉　將有婚變</h3>
<p>— 譚慧斌</p>
<p>據舊金山無錢電廣播消息，廿世紀福斯公司的台柱，好萊塢天字第一號明星泰羅鮑華（Tyrone　Power）是全世界影壇最紅而漂亮的巨星，也是幾千萬女影迷芳心中的理相情人。自從他宣佈結婚以來，不但他的舊情人宋雅海妮，洛麗泰楊等爲之心碎，全世界女影迷（也有男影迷）都爲之難受。好萊塢曾發生過很多奇特的資難消息。可是泰羅因爲那時實在被安娜蓓拉（Annabella）迷變得太厲害了，所以終於他們不顧一切而締婚了。但現在好萊塢帶給我們女影迷一個好消息，泰羅鮑華最近和安娜蓓拉的感情已不像新婚時那般的親密，而月時常有口角爭執等事情發生。雖然安娜蓓拉讓步，但是泰羅覺得夫婦問不應當有不陸的情形，旣然有了，那便不是家庭之福，所以他竟有與安娜蓓拉離婚的企圖，在最近的幾决宴會中，泰羅總是隻身而行，安娜蓓拉好像已明白泰羅了，她知道他楚愛情不堅的人，珍妮蓋諾不是被泰羅騙過的嗎？所以安娜蓓拉也許不會拒絕離婚的，假如泰羅進行離異的話</p>
<h3>從「九陣風」　說到宋德珠（下）</h3>
<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>—並介紹戲校四生</p>
<p>這决隨同宋德珠來滬的，除去鬚生楊寳森，及前决隨毛世來來滬的小丑艾世菊外，尙有蕭德寅，李德彬，宋金聲，佟德新。——叫個戲曲學校畢業生。我現在在下面作一個介紹：</p>
<p>蕭德寅和趟德鈺程玉煥，同稱戲校凈角三傑，德寅工架子花臉，藝宗侯喜瑞，（有人說戲校的學生。且角都學程硯秋。生角都學王少樓。凈角都學侯喜瑞。丑角都學曹二庚。的確有此一說。因爲硯秋是戲校的副校長。所以學生們。都有點偶像觀念。）凡侯之傑作。如「法門寺」一「弓硯豫」「紅拂傅」「丁甲山」「穆柯寨」。蕭都擅長。而且神情做表，也維妙維肖。他是戲校第一批學生，程硯秋對他，極加賞識，這决侯喜瑞脫離秋聲社，德寅曾被邀加入，塡侯的坑。隨秋聲社出演靑島，很受歡迎。</p>
<p>李德彬本刊已有人介紹過，不過語焉不詳。德彬武工根底不差，武戲頗佳，「入大錘」「羣央會」「採莊」等戲，不亞於葉盛蘭；惟文戲稍差，金仲仁對德彬愛護備至，德彬之文戲，乃向仲仁請益。德彬離校後，曾搭李萬春之永春社，及程硯秋之秋聲社：現在由金仲仁的介紹，進葡悬生之慶生社，專與荀子令香配戲，藝更較前進步不少。聽說已經拜荀慧生爲師，最近更新舞台派人北上邀角，慧生曾經力薦德彬，不過他已經與黃余有邀在先，所以謝絕更新的邀請。</p>
<p>宋金聲，佟德新，都日德珠的下手武生，宋金一聲是德珠的兄弟，玩藝兒不錯。不過跟德珠不久，資格經騐，都不及佟德新，佟德新最早就充德珠的下手，德珠沒有他不行，德珠之與佟德新，好像九陣風和閻嵐事，朱桂芳和朱湘泉一樣，一搭一擋，極能畫牡丹綠葉之妙。德珠的下手，最早是佟德新，張德治，曹德潤，趙德勛，後來曹德潤改行，張德治去世，易爲張金元，宋金聲；此决德珠南來，張金元趙德勛榜上無名，大概只有佟德新宋金聲隨來吧。</p>
<h3>西班牙戰時的影院</h3>
<p>— 沁田</p>
<p>距離前線僅半英里　參觀者多作戰兵士</p>
<p>當西班牙戰事正在最緊張的時候，美國某名攝影師跟着軍隊，拍攝戰事新聞片。某夜，寒風凄厲，他看見街頭許多兵士和女人列成一錢蒙着頭，拉了領，好像在等待糧食分配。他便很同情地向朋友說：「這些人眞可憐啊！」但他的朋友說；「你別慌，先去看看等什麽？」轉過街角，原是一家電影院，他們在等買票看馬克斯兄弟的「三星伴月」，西班牙人特別喜歡看馬氏兄弟的影片，因爲這些喜劇大都拉破世故的面具。</p>
<h3>聞畫游藝界</h3>
<p>— 凍雲撰文　岫雲製圖</p>
<p>（十四）講故事</p>
<p>這一種游藝，只有在收音機裹可以聽到，因爲說表方面，過於單純，不適宜於劇塲表演。但也自有它的優點。</p>
<p>夜闌無事，在無綫電畔聽聽故事節目，靜聆半小時，實具陶情悅性之功。</p>
<p>講故事，並不怎樣。容易；沒有相當學識，完全「對證古本」地照書直講，是決不會受人歡迎的。</p>
<h3>安康雅集小序（二）</h3>
<p>— 天虛我生</p>
<p>還有一座好萊塢影院，距離前綫僅僅半英里，前錢作戰兵士有時夜間給假離開戰地，便來戲院看塲電影，再回到火錢上壕溝中去，電影名片「雙城記」亦頗受觀衆歡迎，雪奈卡頓之仁俠行爲得到普遍之讚頌。</p>
<p>這些影院門口，通常堆着沙袋，有一决，某戲院大門口中一炸彈，售票安郞給炸彈炸死，但影戲還是繼續開映。</p>
<p>實在金元，金之耶律楚材降元以後，著有湛然居士集，據其所注，得知阮有四種，吾杭舊有之叫絃大阮，直稱之曰阮咸，別有稱爲小阮者，則興十三品之雙淸相似，但其腹部不同耳，惟均與三絃相類，而三絃又分兩種，一爲害絃，其聲寬大而低，即文書及安康之所用，一爲曲絃，其聲緊小而高，爲南詞北曲之所用，曲絃可以配笛，唱北曲多用之，唱甫詞者則單用，或以二絃之和琴配之。其餘三種，未嘗爲金元所得，故爲北曲所不及用，害絃則配琵琶，故於淵鑑類函，即以琵琶與阮爲一類，而無雙淸與三絃之別，雙淸用於十番細樂，大阮則爲七賢主樂，故爲南詞所不用耳，南詞亦稱花調，則已直斥其非正音矣，但凡彈三絃者必居中上座，列於首位，則共尊重可見，琵琶與和琴則分列左右，而以鼓板居末，設五座者，虛位以待賓白，其有七人合奏則加箏笙簫。而無空手之人，彈三絃者必唱老生或凈，和琴者則唱小生，琵琶則唱旦，而以鼓板屬於丑來，搊箏者例不開口，殆山西秦之人共口音有不合耳。所謂和琴，或竟諟爲胡琴，實非胡制，吾杭稱為二和，則以二絃和三絃四絃及十三絃之箏與十三管之笙，六孔之簫，實可謂爲萬能奇器，名副其實也，嵇康元聲哀樂論云，平和之人，聽箏笛琵琶則形躁而志越，聞琴瑟之音，則體靜而心閒，故吾以爲和琴必始於嵇康，嵇康本喜學老莊，以懶著稱於世，其制適其素性，且半音甚可變通也。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>剃頭與拔毛爲伶人兩大苦事</p>
<p>論起這四人的年齡，當然以梅爲最長，（恐實際上已離五十不述）慧生决之（四十一）小雲與慧生相若，硯秋最幼。（的三十六七）若以扮相而論，恐尙須以蘭芳爲第一，因硯秋肥壯碩長，慧生染有嗜好，小雲生成小家碧玉，無華貴氣概，是故蘭芳雖已年近五旬，然而他的臺風，却依舊不减當年。其實他本人是天生成的鬢鬍，同我們的于院長是不差什麼的，而他所以會使臺下觀衆瞧不出的，這就憑他私下拔毛的工夫異常勤了。上面我曾說過，鬍鬚越剃越長，所以一般唱旦角的男仱，全靠一把小揑子於日常無事時就將一根一根的鬍鬚用揑子拔去，據說拔夫之後，固然也會生長出來，可是比較上總是長得慢而且稀，同時亦不像用刀子光的那般粗硬了。拔時的痛苦，固是一言難盡，但是旣幹這行，又有什麽法子想呢。</p>
<p>有人說凡是受過宮刑的人，就不再長鬍鬚啦，所以太監都沒有鬍子。舞臺上如扮陳琳、郭槐、等老公者，雖劇中人壽至八句以外，髮鬢如雪，老態龍鍾，但皆不帶髯口也。（鬢口、口面、皆內行稱鬍鬚之別名）叉伶人多不留鬚，蓋　留鬚即表示不復登臺之意；如近日之九陣風等是。惟生行因常帶口面關係，老年不常出演時，亦往往蓄之，如孫菊仙等是也。復有人謂旦角年輕時拔鬚甚勤，但一至暮年，卽不再生長，此說究吾可信，尙待探詢焉。（八七）</p>

<h3>President Roosevelt Cables Italian King to Mediate the European Crisis; Chamberlain Announces Poland Still Willing to Negotiate with Germany; Expresses Dissatisfaction with Secret Soviet-German Understanding</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt has cabled King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, requesting him to offer suggestions to find a solution to the current crisis. (Havas Urgent Cable, 24th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt's cable to King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy was read to the King by the US Ambassador at 2:00 PM (Rome time) on the 24th, with Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano present. (Havas Cable, 25th)</p>
<p>Washington - Upon returning to the capital, President Roosevelt declared that his cable to King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy was an effort to eliminate the scourge of war again, while informing the Italian government that if it accepted this suggestion, it would "receive the warm sympathy of the United States." (Havas Cable, 25th)</p>
<p>London - The House of Commons reconvened today, and Prime Minister Chamberlain, amidst cheers, declared, "As I stated before, I now reiterate that, should an incident occur, the British government is prepared to use all its strength without delay." The Prime Minister stated that the announcement of the Soviet-German agreement was like a bomb thrown at the British government. While Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations were underway, the Soviet Union secretly negotiated with Germany to pursue activities conflicting with the British government's diplomatic policy. The government's primary responsibility is to declare that Britain's obligations to Poland remain unchanged. Hitler believes that Eastern Europe is an area where Germany should be free to act. He hopes that reason and justice will find a way out of the current crisis. The choice between war and peace is not in the hands of Britain. If we are forced into a struggle filled with the suffering and calamities of all mankind, the outcome of which no one can foresee, then our fight is not for the sake of acquiring a remote foreign town, but for the preservation of principles, the destruction of which would also be the destruction of all possibilities for peace and security for the nations of the world. The Prime Minister continued that he firmly believed that those who share responsibility with him will consider the fate of millions of lives, which now depends on their actions. As for ourselves, we now have a united nation behind the government (cheers). (Reuters Cable, 24th)</p>
<p>London - The House of Commons reconvened this afternoon, and Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately issued a statement on the European situation, stating that the international situation is deteriorating and the crisis of war is imminent. Our country must take new and severe measures to deal with this grave situation. The German side has issued news that Germans in Poland are being mistreated, which is the same as what happened to Czechoslovakia last year. Germany is now ready and can go to war at any time. Polish politicians are calm and restrained and are still willing to discuss current disputes with the German government, but only if they are certain that they will not be threatened by violence during the discussions and can maintain adequate confidence. As for the conclusion of the non-aggression treaty between Germany and the Soviet Union, the British government was surprised and unhappy upon hearing the news. This is undeniable. Rumors of the adjustment of diplomatic relations between Germany and the Soviet Union have been circulating for a long time, but the Soviet government has never notified our country or the French government of this intention. While Britain and France are conducting negotiations with the Soviet Union based on mutual trust, that country secretly conducted negotiations with Germany, and its apparent goal conflicts with the diplomatic policy we imagined. This is at least unsettling to us (cheers from the members). What is the meaning and impact of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty? We will immediately exchange views with the French government. The time is not yet ripe, and I am reluctant to make a hasty judgment. Our country is now taking defensive measures. To say that we intend to threaten is not the truth. Our past and future actions will not threaten Germany's legitimate interests. Assisting friendly nations in resisting violence should not be regarded as a threat. The discount rate of the Bank of England has now increased from two percent to four percent. This is a normal safeguard measure to protect our country's assets from flowing out of the country during unstable times. Then, the Prime Minister spoke of Sir Henderson, the Ambassador to Germany, meeting with German leader Hitler, stating that this move was to once again inform leader Hitler of our country's position to prevent any misunderstanding. If war were to break out between Britain and Germany, it would be a great disaster. I conveyed this intention to leader Hitler, because, in the view of the British government, all the problems between Poland and Germany do not need to be resolved through war, nor should they be resolved through war. Leader Hitler's answer was nothing more than reiterating Germany's claim that it should maintain freedom of action in Eastern Europe. This statement is a complete misunderstanding of Britain's position because Britain has not demanded a special position in Eastern Europe. Leader Hitler also attributed the responsibility for future wars to countries that obstruct German interests, but if it is said that the interests of a nation must be satisfied through bloodshed or the destruction of the independence of other countries, I dare not agree. At this point, the Prime Minister was filled with emotion and, amidst enthusiastic applause from the members, made the conclusion, "I have done my best to maintain peace, which is witnessed by God. Now, if unfortunately it fails, and our country is forced to fight, then all mankind will feel pain, and no one can predict the outcome. However, the reason why we fight is not about the political future of a remote foreign city, but to uphold a certain principle. If this principle is destroyed, then all nations in the world will never have hope for peace. Fortunately, the disaster has not yet arrived, and reason and a steady mind still have the possibility of prevailing. The lives of millions of people are tied to the actions of those who bear responsibility. I hope that they will be compassionate and empathetic. Our country has been able to unite in this critical period (all members cheered loudly), and I firmly believe that you, the members, will be able to show this purpose to the world." (All members cheered again). (Havas Cable, 24th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Rejects British Prime Minister's Advice, Meets British Ambassador, Expresses Unchanged Original Intention</h3>
<p>Berlin - Ambassador Henderson stayed in Berchtesgaden for half an hour, indicating that his meeting with leader Hitler must have been very brief, probably only about ten minutes. (Havas Cable, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin - Britain's last effort to avert war has now failed, and the tense situation is rapidly escalating. British Ambassador to Germany Henderson, when meeting Hitler in Berchtesgaden yesterday, was reportedly told of the British government's attitude, namely, that the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty would not affect Britain's obligations to Poland in the slightest. Last night, the German official news agency issued an article, stating that Hitler had made it clear to the British Ambassador that the obligations assumed by the British government could not make Germany give up its rights, which are tied to its survival. This kind of answer from Hitler is regarded by people in German political circles as a serious warning to Britain: Britain should not interfere when Germany is forced to defend the interests necessary for its national survival. (Reuters Cable, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Leader Hitler met British Ambassador Sir Henderson twice in Salzburg yesterday. The first time, Sir Henderson delivered Prime Minister Chamberlain's letter to Hitler, and the second time, Sir Henderson received Hitler's reply. According to well-informed sources, there was nothing new in Mr. Chamberlain's letter. Its content was exactly the same as the statement issued by the British government the day before. As for Hitler's reply, according to the German news agency, it clarified Germany's determination to protect its vital rights and would not be influenced by any restrictions from the British government. Diplomatic circles believe that there is no doubt that the German government will not change its attitude. (Haitong Cable, 24th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt and Hull Hasten Back to Washington to Make Another Appeal for Peace</h3>
<p>Washington - According to reliable sources here, although officials do not believe that President Roosevelt will make another direct appeal for peace, several advisors to the State Department are now advocating that President Roosevelt cable Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, asking him to use his influence to stop the war. Some sources also believe that Washington will issue a formal declaration, reiterating the United States' desire for peace. According to reliable sources, the general idea of the various reports prepared for the President to review upon returning to Washington is that "the current crisis cannot be resolved." (Reuters Cable, 24th)</p>
<p>New York - President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull have both cut short their vacations due to the critical situation in Europe and are rushing back to Washington. President Roosevelt is expected to return to Washington this afternoon. In response to reporters, he said that he was "deeply concerned about the crisis in Europe. He does not know what kind of action the government intends to take." The Presidential Palace has firmly stated that although the State Department advised the President to delay his return to the capital until Friday morning for safety reasons, the President decided to return to the capital early. Hull said that he felt it was necessary to "keep pace with the rapidly changing international situation." British Ambassador to the United States Sir Lindsay met with Assistant Secretary of State Welles yesterday. (Reuters Cable, 24th)</p>
<p>Washington - Because of the possibility of a major war in Europe, the State Department last night specifically advised people not to travel to Europe again. At the same time, the US embassies in France and Poland also advised expatriates to leave the country as soon as possible. Senior government officials here held two meetings within 24 hours to discuss the steps the United States should take in the event of war in Europe. (Associated Press Cable, 24th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Review of the Content and Characteristics of the New Soviet-German Pact</h3>
<p>"Although the Soviet Union and Germany's agreement on a non-aggression pact may encounter various difficulties, not only will it not be stillborn, nor difficult to deliver, but it will also be completed quickly." Now, it has been completed in less than a day. According to what has been released from Berlin, the pact has seven articles, the full text of which can be found in today's news column of this newspaper. Among them, the most noteworthy points are decisively recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Article 2: If one of the signatory countries is attacked by another country, the other signatory country shall not, in any way, provide assistance to the attacking country.</p>
<p>Article 3: The two signatory countries shall, from now on, maintain contact and exchange information on all issues of mutual concern.</p>
<p>Article 4: Neither signatory country shall participate in any international group that is unfavorable to the other signatory country.</p>
<p>Assuming that what was transmitted from Berlin fully captures the essence of the document, then the Anglo-French side has been hoping for two days that the content of the pact would stipulate that "if one of the contracting countries has any aggressive acts against a third country, the other contracting country may declare the pact invalid." However, this was not restricted by the Soviet-German pact, meaning that if a contracting country has any aggressive acts against a third country, it will not affect the existence of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. In contrast, the first article of the Chinese-Soviet non-aggression pact (signed on August 21, 1937) explicitly states, "Both parties condemn the use of war as a means of resolving international disputes and recognize war as an instrument of national policy." All of this, which establishes the principle of international peace, was not highlighted by the Soviet-German pact, meaning that acts of war were not condemned by the Soviet-German pact. Based on this, although the Soviet Union and Germany are part of the entire international community, and the deterioration of Soviet-German relations is a crisis for the overall situation, the non-aggression pact now concluded only settles this one element, one aspect. To say that it makes any contribution or provides any benefit to world peace is absolutely not the case.</p>
<p>The Soviet-German non-aggression pact has its own distinct characteristics: The essence of a general non-aggression pact tends to be passive prevention rather than active action, but the new Soviet-German pact cannot be viewed in this way; this is the first characteristic. The binding force of a general treaty tends to be limited to the future and does not apply retroactively (just like Article 3 of the Chinese-Soviet non-aggression pact, which contains such a provision, and there are many other similar examples that cannot be listed); the new Soviet-German pact has a view that encompasses both the past and the future; this is the second characteristic. How can these characteristics be proven? Weren't the Soviet Union and Britain and France supposed to be negotiating a tripartite political agreement and military agreement for a long time? Its meaning is anti-aggression, a peace group, and specifically aimed at Germany. If it were not for Germany, where would it come from? Germany and Italy have a separate military alliance treaty, with Britain and France as assumed enemies, which is a separate matter. Furthermore, hasn't Germany separately signed an international anti-Comintern pact with Japan and Spain? Its meaning is anti-communism, specifically aimed at the Soviet Union. If it were not for the Soviet Union, where would it come from? Now, in the new Soviet-German pact, with the provision in Article 4, "Neither signatory country shall participate in any international group that is unfavorable to the other signatory country," this is an active action to stop the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations. In other words, the Soviet Union should abandon Britain and France because of the new pact, as it is unfavorable to Germany. Since there is a provision in Article 4 and no explicit statement that it does not apply retroactively, this is an active action to abolish the anti-Comintern pact; in other words, Germany should abandon Japan and Spain because of the new pact, as it is unfavorable to the Soviet Union. All of this is a proper interpretation, without any other interpretation, and becomes a very noteworthy characteristic. However, the Soviet Union's Foreign Minister still comforted the British and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union, saying that there was no reason for the tripartite negotiations to stop, and that the Soviet-German non-aggression pact did not conflict with the mutual assistance treaty planned by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union; this is truly a ridiculous statement, and even a great mockery. Coincidentally, and not by mere coincidence, at the same time, the German authorities were reassuring the Japanese and Spanish ambassadors to Germany, saying that the anti-Comintern pact was ideological in nature, and that the restrictions Germany now received from the Soviet Union would not affect the anti-Comintern pact; this mockery has the same ingenious effect as the Soviet Union's statement to Britain and France. The speaker probably smiled, and the listener only gave a bitter smile!</p>
<p>Carefully pondering the articles of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, the Soviet Union, situated between Britain, France, and Germany, is perhaps playing tricks and still has room to perform a sleight of hand; is this a clever tactic of trying to capture by letting go? Speaking from the fundamental policy expressed by the decisive pact, no one needs to have any fantasies beyond the articles. If we examine between the lines of the articles, such as the maintenance of contact and exchange of information stipulated in Article 3, if we interpret this with normal morality, it is to prevent discord; although the interaction is shallow, the words are deep, so can it be said that there is room for letting go? Furthermore, as stipulated in Article 2, if Party A is attacked by another country, then Party B must not assist the other country; if we try to find a loophole in this and say that if Party A attacks another country, then Party B may not be bound by the pact and may still assist the other country; for example, if Germany attacks Poland, and Britain and France fulfill their promises and assist Poland, then although the Soviet Union does not assist Poland because it is dissatisfied with Poland, can't this be regarded as Germany attacking someone, and the Soviet Union retains the freedom to assist Britain and France? Yes, yes, the right to this interpretation belongs to the Soviet Union; however, Germany can proclaim to the world, "I am sincerely punishing Poland because I have no choice, but I have never harmed Britain and France at all. Britain and France are now attacking me!" Speaking from the fundamental policy expressed by the Soviet Union today, wouldn't the Soviet Union politely decline Britain and France, saying, "You are attacking Germany, but I have a pact, so I can't help you"?</p>
<p>What is the Soviet Union's fundamental policy? It is that the Soviet Union only wants Germany to abandon its eastward expansion policy and abandon its anti-communist banner, and fundamentally does not want to participate in the war between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. This is the Soviet Union's policy from beginning to end, and it cannot be shaken by any kind of emotion or trick. The negotiations in Moscow with Britain and France were an attempt to shake it; the attempt failed, but it is not diplomacy's fault.</p>
<p>All that is stated above is based on the articles of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact transmitted from Berlin, and the main purpose is only to review its content. As for the new situation in the international arena that we can look forward to after the establishment of the new pact between the two countries, we will discuss it in a separate article.</p>
<h3>German, Polish, and French Troops Gather at the Border; Polish-German Border Roads Completely Blown Up; Anti-Aircraft Gun Positions Installed in Berlin; French and Polish Reservists Ordered to Report for Duty</h3>
<p>City of Brussels, Belgium - An evening newspaper recently carried a cable from the city of Eupen, stating that German troops have already entered defensive fortifications near the border. Heavy trucks and heavy artillery units are frequently moving in the vicinity of the German district of Petersgensfeld. There are also large-scale troop movements within the Rhine Province, and artillery reservists have been called up. The regular troops at the border between Germany and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg have been withdrawn and replaced by reservists. (Havas News Agency Cable, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin - From this morning, several teams of anti-aircraft gun soldiers have been placing anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns in various military locations, including the rooftops of buildings in the cabinet's deployment area. (Havas News Agency Cable, 24th)</p>

<p>Berlin - From 6:00 AM this morning to 8:00 PM on Saturday, flights are prohibited throughout eastern Germany and East Prussia, except for military and government aircraft. The eastern border extends from Greifswald on the Baltic Sea to Nielebock and Brandenburg, 35 miles west of Berlin, and then extends to the border of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, encircles the Protectorate of Kromau, passes through Linz, re-enters Austria, and ends at Villach near the Italian border. Then, the border line encircles the entire German border and returns to the Baltic coast and Greifswald. (Reuters Cable, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin - German newspapers today continue to publish news of Polish military preparations and anti-German terrorist activities on the Polish border under alarming headlines. According to reports from eastern Upper Silesia in Poland, all roads on the Polish-German border have now been completely blown up. Barbed wire and various obstacles are everywhere. The border villages and towns are filled with Polish troops, and there are observation posts hidden in the forests along the border, monitoring at all times. (Haitong Cable, 24th)</p>
<p>Warsaw - It is reported that the reservists mobilized by the government authorities belong to the 1913, 1914, and 1915 classes. In addition, technical personnel who have not been ordered to mobilize have now been called up. The number of Polish army personnel has therefore increased to 1.5 million. (Havas News Agency Cable, 24th)</p>
<p>Warsaw - Since the French government has taken mobilization measures, the Polish cabinet also held two meetings yesterday afternoon and at 10:00 PM, deciding to take new national defense measures in accordance with the plenary power law passed by the parliament in June of this year to adapt to the needs of the international situation. Those who should be mobilized among the nation's able-bodied men were summoned by telegram last night and this morning. As for how many able-bodied men have been called up, it is difficult to ascertain due to the secrecy of the mobilization. However, according to general estimates, the number should be around one million. In addition, the government has also begun requisitioning vehicles, and economic mobilization and industrial mobilization are also being actively promoted. However, daily life for the people has not been affected in any way, nor have any troops been seen passing through the streets. Railway transportation is as smooth as ever, and the capital is serene. (Havas Cable, 24th)</p>
<p>Warsaw - The general public today began to understand the tension of the current crisis when they read the shocking news of German aggressive actions in the newspapers. Troop movements around Warsaw continued all night last night. Although general mobilization has not yet been announced, the government has issued announcements summoning new reservists from many age groups. (Reuters Cable, 24th)</p>
<p>Danzig - According to reliable sources from the Polish Corridor, mobilization has been officially announced in Poland today. All farmers are being forced by the gendarmerie to abandon their work and go to the fortresses to serve. (Haitong Cable, 24th)</p>
<h3>French Reserve Soldiers - A Portion Called to Duty</h3>
<p>Paris - The Ministry of Defense has issued a notice stating that the Ministry will exercise requisition rights in the capital area starting at midnight today. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Paris - Premier and Minister of National Defense Daladier convened a meeting at 6:30 PM, gathering relevant ministers and leaders of the army, navy, and air force. A decision was made to call up reserve officers and soldiers with technical skills. President Lebrun returned to Paris at 7:00 PM in the evening and is scheduled to preside over a State Council meeting tomorrow. At that time, France's firm position on the Polish question will be reiterated. Sources close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believe the situation is extremely serious, but consider that Germany may not take any action against the Polish Corridor tomorrow. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Paris - French Premier Daladier, in light of the increasingly tense international situation, continued to call up conscripts last night. According to military experts, the number of armed soldiers in Europe has reached as many as ten million. Daladier announced that French reserve replenishment troops have received orders to report for duty, and therefore preparations for the German-Polish crisis have been fully completed. Last night, the atmosphere in Paris was filled with wartime tension, and conscripts filled the trains leaving Paris. At the same time, thousands of reservists rushed from various places to gathering points in the west. Also, the number of conscripts' relatives gathered at the train station last night was unusually large. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Paris - France is currently actively engaged in military preparations. The Paris train stations are extremely busy with military transport. Cafés in front of the stations are crowded with soldiers from the Maginot Line assault teams, as well as many reserve officers and soldiers. It should be noted that the Gare de l'Est (Paris East Station) is an important railway station for access to France's eastern border. (Haitong, 24th)</p>
<p>Paris - French conscripts who have mobilization certificates marked with the number "2" have now been called up for duty. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Paris - This morning, notices were posted outside the Paris City Hall and public places, calling up those with mobilization certificates marked with the number "3" or "4". This is the first round of mobilization, equivalent to a partial mobilization. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Paris - Here, everything is no different from usual, except for the reserve soldiers being sent off at the station by their families after being ordered to mobilize. Residents go about their business as usual. Newspaper vendors sell special editions of the latest news along the streets. Many new-style public buses have been requisitioned, resulting in a decrease in the number running on the streets. All train stations are extremely busy, with special trains full of soldiers departing from time to time. Large posters are posted on the platforms, indicating the destinations of each train. Long-distance telephone lines between cities have also been reserved for transmitting official reports. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Paris - Since the full text of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact was disclosed, hopes for a military alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have completely vanished. Therefore, France is prepared for general mobilization. The French army has now increased to over 1.5 million men. The Maginot Line is fully manned with defensive forces, and troops on the second line of defense have also arrived at their destinations. All private cars have been requisitioned by the government. Crowds gather in front of the city council hall to read mobilization orders, while armed men travel incessantly to the train stations to take trains to the border. Many people here believe that the Soviet Union's decision is a major blow to Britain and France, and suspect that there are still secret clauses. According to Madame Tabouis, a diplomatic correspondent for the business newspaper, Ribbentrop brought several rolls of phonograph records from Chamberlain's visit to Hitler last year on his trip to Moscow, revealing that people in Britain and France greatly hoped that Germany would attack the Soviet Union at the time. Angered by this, the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with Ribbentrop. (Associated Press, 24th)</p>
<h3>Daladier Plans to Form a National Unity Cabinet</h3>
<p>Paris - Premier Daladier, in view of the extremely serious situation in Europe, is reportedly planning to issue an appeal to the nation, urging them to work together to overcome the difficulties. His first step is to form a "national unity" cabinet. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Paris - The cabinet held a State Council meeting this morning. Premier Daladier declared that the situation in Europe is extremely serious, and he has taken various military measures to ensure safety. The State Council approved this. Foreign Minister Bonnet then reported on the situation and analyzed the clauses of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact. According to sources close to the government, if the situation becomes more serious, Premier Daladier plans to form a "national unity" cabinet and call on the people to work together to overcome the difficulties. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>British Army and Navy Prepare to Respond to Various Incidents</h3>
<p>London - Since last night, British warships have been preparing to sail to naval bases in the North Sea. The British regular army and territorial army are also prepared to move. London's anti-aircraft units are implementing continuous day and night alert measures, preparing to respond to enemy aircraft attacks at any time. (Associated Press, 24th)</p>
<p>London - Political figures here have stated that, according to Franco-Italian regulations, the British government does not need to seek parliamentary approval to declare war. It only needs to submit a request to the King for signature and request parliamentary ratification afterward, which is sufficient. When war was declared on Germany in 1914, Parliament was in session, so there was no question. Now that Parliament has reconvened, the cabinet can get timely ratification if it makes a final decision. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>London - British Foreign Secretary Halifax is scheduled to deliver a short broadcast address from Downing Street at 8:30 PM tonight, which will be broadcast to all parts of the British Empire and the United States. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<p>London - Members of Parliament who belong to the navy, army, and air force reserve units can attend the special meeting of Parliament today without applying for leave. Former Foreign Secretary Eden and former First Lord of the Admiralty Duff Cooper are both members of Parliament who are serving in the reserve. (Associated Press, 24th)</p>
<p>Canberra - Authorities here announced today that they are currently recruiting a special force of 14,000 volunteer militia members to perform current emergency duties. The force will protect vulnerable locations during the mobilization of the militia. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Gibraltar - Gibraltar is now making military preparations. All defensive works, such as anti-aircraft gun stations, are manned by troops. The northern entrance of the harbor has been equipped with a water barrier for protection. All troops are on standby in barracks, and officers have canceled all leaves. A senior military officer said that the British forces in Gibraltar have quietly prepared everything to respond to all kinds of events. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Belgium, Netherlands, Greece, and Other Countries Make Military Preparations</h3>
<p>Brussels - The holidays of officers of all ranks have been canceled, awaiting further orders. However, soldiers currently on holiday will not be recalled. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>The Hague - Dutch Prime Minister Kier arrived here yesterday from Germany, after the government ordered all government officials to take vacations in the country.

<p>Athens - The Ministry of the Army has issued a bulletin stating that all reservists of the 1936 and 1937 classes belonging to field artillery, heavy artillery, mountain artillery, cavalry, and telegraph units should report for duty to participate in exercises. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Serious Incident Occurs on the German-Polish Border - Germans Break into Polish Territory and Open Fire - German Passenger Plane Reportedly Shot Down by Polish Troops</h3>
<p>Warsaw - Responsible sources here stated that a German sentry intruded one kilometer into Polish territory near the city of Eylau in East Prussia this morning. Several serious incidents also occurred last night. Fifteen Germans broke into the Polish border at midnight last night and attacked the customs office at the Małachowicza station in the Katowice district, firing over a hundred shots. A railway mechanic and border guard Ruda were both injured. The rioters dragged Ruda into German territory. Several other Germans also attacked the sentry post in the village of Kiramowice in the Rybnik district this morning, firing a total of over two hundred shots. Fortunately, there were no casualties. It is generally expected that Polish Ambassador to Germany Lipski will lodge a protest with the German government tomorrow. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The semi-official German news agency DNB issued a message stating that two German transport planes were shot at by Polish soldiers while flying outside Polish airspace. However, this has not been confirmed by Polish sources here. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Danzig Overthrows Constitution - Appoints Forster as Head of State - City Police Arrest Large Number of Poles - Customs Negotiations Break Down</h3>
<p>Berlin - The semi-official German news agency DNB issued a message stating that the Senate of the Free City of Danzig has issued an order in two articles: (1) Forster, the leader of the Nazi Party in the Free City, is appointed as the head of state of the Free City. (2) This law shall take effect on the 23rd. Regarding this matter, German officials refused to comment, stating that this is an internal matter of the Free City of Danzig and has no direct relationship with Germany. Observers said that Forster's appointment as the head of state of the Free City is no different from Hitler's appointment as the head of state of Germany in the capacity of the Nazi Party. It is essentially the implementation of a unitary system and the complete overthrow of the current constitution of Danzig, but not an immediate annexation into Germany. It is still unknown how Senate President Greiser will be accommodated. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The semi-official German news agency DNB issued a message stating that Poland sent a delegation to Danzig to discuss customs issues with the city authorities, but they returned to Warsaw without completing the matter. The current negotiations have therefore been declared broken due to this unilateral action. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Danzig - The city police have arrested over one hundred Poles, mostly railway workers. It is generally believed that Germany may take action against the Danzig railway, which is the asset of the Polish government. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Danzig - The British Consul General in Danzig, Shepherd, left Danzig for home with his luggage last night. (Haitong, 24th)</p>

<h3>German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact - Signed in Moscow the Night Before - Not to Participate in Actions Detrimental to Each Other - To Maintain Contact Regularly Hereafter for Ten Years</h3>
<p>Moscow - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived here by plane yesterday. A noteworthy feature at the airport was that the Soviet hammer and sickle flag and the German swastika flag were displayed side by side for the first time. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Moscow - Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop held the first meeting on the non-aggression pact at 3:30 PM yesterday. The meeting lasted for three hours. Besides Molotov and Ribbentrop, Dahlin and German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Schulenburg were also present. At 10:00 PM in the evening, the two sides reopened negotiations and finally signed the non-aggression pact. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"The Government of the Soviet Union and the Government of Germany, guided by the desire to strengthen the cause of peace between the Soviet Union and Germany, and taking as their basis the fundamental provisions of the Neutrality Treaty concluded between the Soviet Union and Germany in April, 1926, have agreed upon the following:</p>
<p>(1) The two Contracting Parties undertake to refrain from any act of violence, any aggressive action, and any attack on each other, either individually or jointly with other Powers.</p>
<p>(2) Should one of the Contracting Parties become the object of belligerent action by a third Power, the other Contracting Party shall in no manner lend its support to this third Power.</p>
<p>(3) The Governments of the two Contracting Parties shall in the future maintain continual contact with one another for the purpose of consultation in order to exchange information on questions affecting their common interests.</p>
<p>(4) Neither of the two Contracting Parties shall participate in any grouping of Powers whatsoever that is directly or indirectly aimed at the other Party.</p>
<p>(5) Should disputes or conflicts arise between the two Contracting Parties over questions of one kind or another, each Party shall seek to settle these disputes or conflicts exclusively by means of friendly exchange of opinion or, if necessary, by the establishment of arbitration commissions.</p>
<p>(6) The present Treaty shall be concluded for a period of ten years, with the proviso that, unless one of the Contracting Parties denounces it one year before the expiration of this period, the validity of this Treaty shall be deemed to be automatically prolonged for another five years.</p>
<p>(7) The present Treaty shall be ratified within the shortest possible time. The instruments of ratification shall be exchanged in Berlin. The Treaty shall enter into force immediately upon signature. Done in Moscow, on August 23, 1939, in two originals, in the German and Russian languages. Molotov, Plenipotentiary of the Government of the Soviet Union; Ribbentrop, Plenipotentiary of the Government of Germany. (TASS, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The news of the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact was broadcast by the local radio station at 2:00 AM this morning. After hearing the news, officials enthusiastically commented, "The value of this move is self-evident." Political figures attach great importance to Article 4 of the treaty (which stipulates that neither party shall participate in any group that is directly or indirectly unfavorable to the other signatory). The obligations stipulated in the Anti-Comintern Pact and the League of Nations Covenant have been canceled by this article. It is noted that when Germany and the Soviet Union signed a treaty of friendship and neutrality in 1916, the Soviet Union demanded that Germany provide a guarantee that it would not fulfill the obligations stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant to deal with the Soviet Union. Therefore, the same provision was agreed upon (Article 3 stipulated that if other countries formed a group to boycott one of the signatories by economic and financial means, the other party shall not participate). At the same time, the German government stated in the annex that if the League of Nations made any decision regarding the Soviet Union, Germany should oppose it. However, the situation is different now that the non-aggression pact has been concluded. Germany is bound by the Anti-Comintern Pact, and the Soviet Union is a member of the League of Nations. Therefore, Article 4 of this treaty is worded broadly. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The semi-official German news agency DNB issued a message stating that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop made a speech when he returned to Berlin by plane from Moscow, saying, "Historically, if Germany and the Soviet Union are hostile, the situation is extremely bad. Once they become friends, the situation becomes clear. Yesterday was one of the most meaningful days in the fate of our two great nations. Hitler and Stalin have become good friends. The non-aggression and consultation treaty signed by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and I is solid and unshakable. The two great nations of Germany and the Soviet Union should cooperate closely based on this treaty. This is a major turning point in the history of our two countries. A certain country attempted to encircle Germany and the Soviet Union. This treaty was born in response to this. It will also have a good impact on the relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, and the friendship between Germany and Japan. This can be asserted." (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>British and French Military Representatives Prepare to Return Home - Germany Also Plans to Woo Turkey</h3>
<p>Moscow - The British military delegation will travel to the capital of Finland by plane today or tomorrow. The whereabouts of the French military delegation are still unknown, but the passports required by the representatives were signed by the Soviet authorities yesterday, and they may leave Moscow after the British military delegation. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Moscow - Two representatives of the British military delegation are scheduled to return to London by plane tomorrow to report on the discussions between the staff officers of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The remaining representatives, as well as the French representatives, will remain here, awaiting instructions from their governments, and then decide on their next steps. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>London - Responsible sources here stated that the ongoing negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have stalled, but have not broken down. The governments of Britain and France both want to understand the true meaning of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact before deciding whether the staff talks should continue. It is still unknown what the Soviet Union's intentions are. However, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov told the ambassadors of Britain and France that the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union were proceeding too slowly. This is the reason why Germany and the Soviet Union agreed to the non-aggression pact, but the trilateral negotiations can still continue. In addition, Britain and France have once again negotiated with the Polish government, urging it to agree to allow Soviet troops to pass through Polish territory in wartime, so that the main difficulties of the trilateral negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can be resolved.

<p>Berlin - Prime Minister Hitler vigorously advanced the movement to acquire the European balance of power last night, and is trying to get Turkey to leave the democratic camp. The Nazi Party believes that Germany has a high chance of signing a non-aggression pact with Turkey, in order to overthrow the efforts of Britain and France to drag Turkey into the anti-German encirclement front of democratic countries. The German ambassador to Turkey, Von Papen, left Berlin last night to go to Turkey. He will negotiate with the Turkish government to sign a non-aggression pact. (Associated Press, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin - German Ambassador to Turkey Von Papen returned to his post here today. He is reportedly carrying concrete instructions to advise Turkey to change its current policy. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Bewilderment - Will It Correct Its Attitude Toward Britain and the United States? - Tokyo Authorities Hold Meetings in Panic - Japanese Newspapers Scold Germany for Selling Out Friends</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The authorities held multiple meetings yesterday, which proves that the German-Soviet non-aggression agreement has greatly shaken the authorities. Japan's future policy will be greatly influenced by this move. Konoe set off for Hayama today to inform Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa of Prime Minister Hiranuma's beliefs about the new situation and his own opinions. Asahi Shimbun published a lengthy report from New York today, urging that Japan should correct its attitude toward Britain and the United States. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese sources here said that the concrete plan to strengthen the anti-communist axis has been invalidated due to Germany's actions. The Japanese government will now adjust its European policy and take unilateral action. Prime Minister Hiranuma, former Prime Minister Konoe, and Minister of the Army Itagaki agreed on this issue yesterday. Minister of the Navy Yonai, Foreign Minister Arita, and Finance Minister Ishiwata met with the Prime Minister separately today and reportedly agreed with the opinions of Hiranuma, Konoe, and Itagaki. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Today, Miyako Shimbun predicted that the Japanese government may declare the abandonment of the Nine-Power Treaty within days, believing that the situation in East Asia has undergone drastic changes since the treaty was established. The Japanese government must absolutely reject the path of collective interference in Japan's affairs in China. All newspapers said that Japan has long held the opinion that the treaty has become a dead letter, but democratic countries still use the treaty as the basis for discussing all issues in China. Britain and the United States are now trying to inquire about Japan's opinions in order to convene an international conference based on the treaty. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese newspapers today vehemently criticized Germany and became even more resentful due to the alleged offer from Berlin to serve as an intermediary for negotiations on a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression treaty, scolding "Germany for selling out its allies who share the same ideology." On the other hand, the German expatriates here are all elated, saying that Britain and France may retreat without a fight. Asahi Shimbun said that Germany has clearly violated the text and spirit of the Anti-Comintern Pact, and the pact has now become a scrap of paper. Japan has abandoned its obligations and must start anew, establishing a new order in East Asia, and this new order can only be completed by expelling communism from Asia. It is absurd for Japan to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union is the hypothetical enemy against which Japan has been arming for many years. Miyako Shimbun asked sarcastically, "Who said that the Anti-Comintern Pact is a spiritual bond between the related countries?" Saying this is an optimist. Hochi Shimbun said, "The snake catcher has been bitten by the snake. Japan's great anger must be silently endured." Nichi Nichi Shimbun said, "Some people advocate that Japan should determine Germany's true motives. We doubt whether this is possible. Italy may follow Germany and force Japan to follow suit. However, the Soviet government and the name of communism are different in name but the same in reality. Why waste time quibbling now? We can return to an autonomous and independent Japanese policy."

<h3>Seven Nordic Countries Call for Peace</h3>
<p>Brussels, Belgium - The foreign ministers of the signatory countries of the Oslo Convention (i.e., Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Finland) held a meeting here, which closed at 8:00 PM. King Leopold III of Belgium immediately delivered a speech on behalf of the heads of state of each country, appealing to European countries for peace, and hoping that the current disputes in Europe would be resolved peacefully, without resorting to force. He said, "If all those who hold the key to the situation can truly show a spirit of friendly cooperation, negotiate on the demands they have put forward and the disputes between the countries, this is what we most desire." Although the time is extremely urgent, it is not too late to start negotiations immediately. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>A Reporter Asks - When Will the Japanese Fleet Sail to the Mediterranean?</h3>
<p>Tokyo - At a press conference this morning, Rear Admiral Kanazawa, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Navy, declined to comment on the impact of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty on Japan, but said, "Independence and autonomy are the best and most stable ways to achieve Japan's goal of establishing a new order in East Asia. Japan now has the opportunity to re-recognize the correct situation, and this will definitely become a powerful factor in resolving the China Incident." A reporter asked, "The opinions of the army and navy on Japan's accession to the German-Italian military alliance are different. Has this been resolved?" Kanazawa replied, "This is just a rumor spread by outsiders when various parties discussed this issue without reaching a decision." There is no reason to be anxious about the new situation in Europe, allowing it to change instantaneously in the current international situation. A foreign reporter asked, "When will the Japanese fleet sail to the Mediterranean?" Rear Admiral Kanazawa replied with a smile, "We are preparing." (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Ambassador Quizzes German Foreign Minister, Parts Ways Unhappily</h3>
<p>Berlin: Sources among the Japanese community here recently revealed that prior to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to the Soviet Union, Japanese Ambassador General Oshima met with him on the 22nd to question the signing of the non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet Union. At the time, Ambassador Oshima, "in his military style, spoke frankly, without the slightest reservation," and the two sides parted on rather unhappy terms. Regarding this matter, German officials reportedly told the Japanese and Spanish envoys that the Anti-Comintern Pact was purely ideological and that Germany would never allow any commitments accepted by the Soviet Union to affect this pact. Upon hearing this, the Japanese side considered it a "humorous remark." Because Germany did not consult with Japan and Spain beforehand, nor did it inform them of its intentions, people from both Japan and Spain said that Germany's move was extremely bold and requested the German government to explain in detail. This made those in charge in Germany quite unhappy. In addition, some of the German petty bourgeoisie and some workers who followed National Socialism were not sincere. Now hearing the news that Germany and the Soviet Union had agreed on a non-aggression treaty, they were extremely pleased. When workers met on the streets, they greeted each other with the cry of "Long Live Moscow." However, true members of the National Socialist Party were all bewildered because their position had to be completely changed after this. Moreover, many people strongly stated that the Soviet Union would occupy a pivotal position in Europe. The fact that the German Foreign Minister was now going to the capital of the Bolshevik country would seriously damage Germany's prestige internationally, and therefore they openly expressed regret. Those in charge said that Germany would hold a memorial on the 27th of this month in Tannenberg for the victory over Russia in the European War. Now, signing a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, that is, the defeated country in the European War, was inevitably contradictory. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Soviet Newspapers Comment: The Soviet-German Agreement</h3>
<p>Moscow: Today's editorials in *Pravda* and *Izvestia* both commented on the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. *Izvestia* stated, "Stalin, in his historical report to the 18th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, summarized the part about international politics, saying, "We advocate maintaining peaceful, close, and friendly relations with all our neighbors." This principle has long been the cornerstone of Soviet foreign policy. The Soviet Union has always used this principle as a guideline, and has consistently strived to safeguard universal peace, thereby first and foremost striving to maintain peaceful relations with countries geographically closest to it. Stalin continued in the aforementioned report, "This is our position, and we will abide by it, as long as these countries maintain similar relations with the Soviet Union, and do not attempt to directly or indirectly infringe upon the integrity and inviolability of the Soviet Union's borders." "The recent development of relations between Germany and the Soviet Union is a good example of this principle. On August 19, the two countries signed a commercial and credit agreement in Berlin. On August 23, the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact was concluded in Moscow. These two documents are of great significance not only for the relations between the two signatory countries, but also for the entire world's international political situation. It is self-evident that the establishment of peaceful relations between two major powers such as the Soviet Union and Germany will inevitably be sufficient to calm the extremely tense general international situation. Not only the fact that the Soviet Union and Germany signed a non-aggression pact, but also the content of the pact is completely sufficient to prove this. It is commonly known that in relations between countries, certain problems often arise that can lead to disputes and conflicts contrary to the original intentions of both parties. The pact signed on August 23 contains provisions for such incidents, stating that when such incidents occur, "the two parties will resolve such disputes or conflicts exclusively through peaceful means, through friendly exchanges of views or, if necessary, by establishing a commission to mediate the conflict." The pact further stipulates that the two parties must maintain contact, and engage in discussions and exchange of information on matters pertaining to their common interests. This condition will first and foremost assist in preventing the aforementioned unforeseen events, namely disputes and conflicts between the two parties, from occurring. Therefore, from a political and legal standpoint, the pact signed in Moscow yesterday, with a term of ten years, is a document of extraordinary significance. This pact brings the relations between the two major countries to complete normalcy, and this point alone will surely help to stabilize the international political situation in Europe and the world. This pact has put an end to the adversarial attitude in the relations between Germany and the Soviet Union, and the adversarial attitude is precisely what the enemies of both countries are attempting to instigate and prolong. Differences in ideology and political systems should not and must not prevent the establishment and maintenance of good neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Germany. In summary, "this newly signed non-aggression pact, as well as the commercial and credit agreement of August 19, inherently contain the necessary preconditions for the friendly relations between the peoples of the Soviet Union and Germany to develop day by day." *Pravda* stated, "The significance of the pact goes beyond adjusting the relations between the two signatory countries. The conclusion of the pact comes at a time when the international situation has reached an extremely sharp and tense degree. The Soviet-German non-aggression pact is indeed an act of peace and will undoubtedly help to ease the international tensions. The conclusion of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact is undoubtedly a very important event of international significance, because it is a tool for peace and will not only promote good neighborly and peaceful relations between the Soviet Union and Germany, but will also be beneficial to the consolidation of general peace. The hostility between the Soviet Union and Germany has now ceased. Differences in ideology and political systems should not and must not become obstacles to establishing good neighborly relations between the two countries. The friendship between the Soviet and German peoples, which had been put into a stalemate by the enemies of the two countries, now has the necessary conditions for development and prosperity."

<h3>British Nationals in Germany Ordered to Evacuate</h3>
<p>Berlin: British Ambassador Henderson recently issued a notice to the country's consulates and nationals, stating, "Due to the tense relations between Britain and Germany, all nationals are advised to prepare for a temporary evacuation as soon as possible. Anyone who makes a decision in accordance with this order should be responsible for their own actions." Many copies of this notice have already been printed, and all nationals can request to read them at the embassy. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Zhu Zongzhuo, Yuan Hanjun, Former Nankai Students: Zhang Boling's Statement</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Zhang Boling, President of Nankai University and Vice-Chairman of the National Political Council, told a Reuters reporter this morning that Zhu Zongzhuo and Yuan Hanjun, who recently sent a letter to the Hong Kong government confessing to being the assassins of Cheng Xigeng, were both former students of Tianjin Nankai University. After the fall of Tianjin, the two remained in the area due to important missions. Although he cannot actively prove that the two were the assassins of Cheng Xigeng, there is indeed strong circumstantial evidence to indicate that this is extremely possible. Both were excellent students. After speaking, Zhang showed a copy of the 1936 Nankai University alumni directory, which stated that Zhu Zongzhuo was from Gushi County, Henan, was 17 years old at the time, and was studying in the first year of high school. Zhang also said that he knew Zhu's grandfather and father and also had a cousin who was currently working as an assistant teacher at Tsinghua University in Kunming. Zhang continued, stating that Yuan Hanjun graduated from the Nankai Middle School in 1936, was 19 years old at the time, and was originally from Shangyu, Zhejiang. When Nankai moved from Tianjin to Sichuan Province, the two students did not come to Chongqing until August 7 of this year, when they visited professors and classmates at the school. The two were extremely tight-lipped about their activities, only asking their classmates not to publicize the news of their arrival in Chongqing. Zhang also recalled the destruction of Tianjin Nankai University by the Japanese two years ago and said that his students were determined to avenge the country and the school. More than eighty Nankai students have sacrificed themselves in this decisive battle. Zhu and Yuan were both good young men, and it is very possible that they were the real assassins of Cheng Xigeng, because he knows that there are many former Nankai students now engaged in patriotic work in Tianjin and other parts of North China. Zhang agreed to inquire among the two's former classmates whether there were any letters or conversations that could prove that they were related to this case. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Forms a Major Fortress: Presents an Unprecedented State of Tension; British Forces Have Mobilized Military Strength; Working on Defense Throughout the Night; Heavy Artillery Transported to the Mountain Peak for Placement; Women and Children Prepare to Move to Manila</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Since the British government instructed the Hong Kong government to take all necessary security measures, Hong Kong has outwardly transformed into a major fortress. According to British military authorities, the Japanese troops concentrated around the Kowloon border and their weapons far exceed what is necessary to deal with guerrillas. As for the present, although there is not yet any major change expected here, the British have already begun various preventive measures, such as the evacuation of civilians, the mobilization of defensive forces, and the control of food supplies. At the same time, the artillery positions that were set up on the mountain peaks of Hong Kong several months ago are also being used by the British to transport heavy artillery up the mountain for placement, to supplement the inadequacy of the Stanley Military Island Battery and the Davis Battery, in order to control the gateway to Hong Kong. Also, the British military headquarters here presents an unprecedented state of tension, and employs Chinese laborers to work on defense works and the urgent construction of air-raid shelters throughout the night. British military authorities have asked reporters not to inspect the Kowloon border area. Most British women and children and other foreign nationals have prepared to evacuate and move to Manila. According to the American consulate here, there is extreme crowding of people seeking to go to Manila. Also, tonight the government spokesperson stated in a radio broadcast that all women and children should evacuate early before the situation worsens, because Hong Kong has become a fortress, and in the event of war, the presence of women and children here would only be a hindrance, so the government has no choice but to order an evacuation. It was also said that although the current situation has not yet reached the final critical point, preparations should be made as early as possible. (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)</p>

At the same time, the *Ettrick* is scheduled to sail out on Saturday or Sunday if the situation does not improve. As for where it is sailing to, it has not been announced. The authorities in Manila and Macau have agreed to cancel regulations such as the requirement for incoming persons to have a sanitary certificate to facilitate the entry of refugees.

<p>Hong Kong: Due to the changes in the European situation and the increasingly tense Japanese encirclement, the authorities have sent engineers to demolish the Luohu Railway Bridge and dig trenches along the Tai Po Road in preparation for sealing off Kowloon at any time.

<p>London: According to Reuters, official London has acknowledged the startling news of the Japanese blockade of Hong Kong. It is said that Chinese guerrillas have been very active in that area and elsewhere recently. The Japanese army has notified the Hong Kong government 48 hours before military action in accordance with the conditions agreed upon last year. The relationship between the British and Japanese staff officers on the border continues to be friendly as before. Also, according to a senior official speaking to a Reuters reporter, the cutting off of roads and bridges on the Kowloon border, and the warning to women and children to prepare to evacuate, are merely one aspect of the precautions taken by the British Empire in various places due to the precarious European situation. Unfortunately, this happened to coincide with the Japanese military action, which led to various rumors. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: Someone inquired here about the possible impact of the overall situation from well-informed Chinese sources, who replied, "We do not know what changes the future will bring." However, they said that it is highly doubtful that Japan will truly attempt to occupy Hong Kong. Before the announcement of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, it was generally believed that Japan was preparing to put pressure on Britain in the Far East, but recent developments in Europe may have completely changed the situation. At the same time, it is widely believed that Japan may take advantage of Britain's difficult position in Europe to threaten Hong Kong, in order to induce Britain to follow Japan's example in the Far East and revise the Anglo-Japanese alliance. Even if Japan makes this attempt, it will only occupy Kowloon, and will not obstruct Hong Kong. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: All-India Congress President Nehru's first night in Chongqing was both stimulating and interesting, as Japanese planes attempted to raid and were defeated by Chinese fighter planes after a fierce air battle. Upon receiving news of the arrival of the Japanese planes, President Chiang immediately called Nationalist Party Secretary-General Zhu Jiahua and instructed him to ensure Nehru's safety. The Indian leader was then led into Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui's well-built air-raid shelter. Wang, along with Minister of Communications Zhang Jiaao, Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council Zhang Jun, and League of Nations expert Rajchman, were also there. During the air raid, Nehru and the Chinese leaders happily exchanged views on domestic and international issues for two hours. Twenty-seven Japanese bombers, taking advantage of the moonlight and the difficulty for Chinese fighter planes to attack in the dark, flew directly to Chongqing from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in two groups at about 6:30 pm. As soon as the alarm was sounded, Chinese fighter planes immediately took off. Twenty-five minutes later, the Japanese planes appeared, and the fighter planes immediately engaged them. The Japanese bombers attempted to break through in two groups, but each time they were intercepted by the defending planes. The sound of machine guns could be heard clearly, and the planes could be seen tumbling up and down. Because the Chinese interception was very fierce, the Japanese planes only dropped a few bombs far from the city and failed to bomb Chongqing. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Today, news from the Japanese military training here claims that "Japanese naval aircraft attacked the Xiaolongkan military facility sixteen miles west of Chongqing last night and carried out effective bombing.

<h3>British Army Garrison in Tianjin Destroyed by Flood; One British Soldier Electrocuted and Killed</h3>
<p>Beiping: According to travelers arriving here from Tianjin, the British army garrison in Tianjin has been destroyed by the flood. The rain has not stopped, but it is no longer as intense as before. The authorities have now prepared to cope with several weeks of emergency measures. Tianjin British Army Commander Brigadier Lowry has been forced to move to a hotel higher up in the British concession. The British army spent a night sleeping on the roofs of their barracks and are now stationed in various warehouses. The army's bakery and hospital have also been washed away. Although there is still a lot of flour, it is very difficult to make the bread needed by the entire army. The residence of an official of the British Consulate General has now been converted into a hospital. Lifeboats, etc., from the British escort ship *Santarves* (1,045 tons) are now being piloted by naval soldiers to transport goods to and from the streets of the British concession. All commerce has completely stopped, and the shops have all closed their doors. The clerks of the flooded banks are living in the banks. The British concession still has no electricity. It is heard that even the intermittent supply of tap water has now been cut off. The water in the Japanese concession is ten feet high. Japanese nationals seeking refuge are now arriving here in droves. The yachts of Beiping's lakes have all been requisitioned to be sent to Tianjin by the military to reduce the difficulty of transportation on the flooded streets. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Last night, a British soldier was found electrocuted on the barbed wire barrier surrounding the British concession. His name is still unknown. Several Chinese and one foreigner in the British concession have drowned. The foreigner drowned in the center of the British concession. It is believed to be a Russian. At the same time, there is a great danger of an epidemic spreading in Tianjin, as the flood has broken through the latrines, causing a nauseating stench to fill the city. Food supplies are very scarce, and prices are soaring. The authorities are now organizing food collection points and are planning to use barges to transport water from Tanggu, as it is expected that the water supply may be cut off at any time. There is still no electricity. (Dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly Battle Report</h3>
<p>Chongqing – A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that the focus of military operations this week (August 16th to 22nd) remained in southeastern Shanxi. All other fronts saw only sporadic fighting. Chinese forces maintained a steady, defensive approach, repeatedly blunting enemy advances. The capture of Jincheng dealt a heavy blow to the enemy. The details of the campaign are outlined below:</p>
<p>"Shanxi Front": Since the enemy advanced along the Baijin Highway with the superior strength of five divisions, our forces adopted a scorched-earth tactic, deploying in the mountains on both sides. Taking advantage of the enemy's lack of a firm foothold, we launched attacks from multiple directions. Since last week, we have successively captured strongholds west of the highway, including Yangcheng, Qinshui, Qinyuan, and Changzi, as well as Yushe, Wuxiang, Liaoxian, and Linxian to the east. We defeated the invading enemy and besieged Jincheng, the enemy's last stronghold. Although the Japanese continuously reinforced and counterattacked, they were repeatedly repelled. By the evening of the 19th, the Japanese were overwhelmed and fled north. On the morning of the 20th, the county town was completely recovered. We then pressed forward, capturing Tianjingguan on the border of Shanxi and Henan provinces, and pursued the enemy to Sanliqiao, Qilingcun, and Wangtai, cutting off their reinforcements. Over 2,000 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and over 1,000 weapons were seized. Our vanguard is now pressing on the outskirts of Gaoping City, and its capture is imminent. The enemy's attempt to control the borders of Henan and Hebei provinces by holding the Baijin and Jijin highways has been completely shattered by our forces. The enemy in Lishi and Zhongyang in western Shanxi, after being fiercely attacked by our troops for several days, is in a precarious situation, now only holding their positions defensively. We are intensifying our encirclement. "Guangdong Front": The Japanese troops in the Chaozhou-Shantou area of eastern Guangdong launched a three-pronged attack on Shaxitou last week. After being routed by our forces, the enemy repeatedly launched attacks through Anbu, but were heavily defeated. Some enemy troops aggressively attacked Dongpu and Fengxi, attempting to divert our forces, but they were intercepted and defeated. The enemy retreated into the city and has remained inactive. In the Zengcheng-Conghua area of the northern Guangdong front, we engaged the enemy in fierce battles at Shengang, Longtian, and Baitagang, killing over 500 enemy soldiers. The area is now completely under our control. On the western Guangdong front, since the 19th, over 1,000 enemy soldiers advancing along the Xinhe and Xinkai roads were lured into pre-set positions in the Duruan, Jinggen, and Pingdiling areas and surrounded and annihilated. The enemy abandoned over 500 bodies and fled back to Jiangmen. We pursued and pressed the attack to the city walls, continuing the fierce assault. Separately, over 2,000 enemy troops landed in Nantou (south of Bao'an) and Dapeng Bay, engaging our forces in fierce battles. Since the 18th, we have launched a courageous counterattack against the enemy invading Shenzhen, fighting fiercely for several days. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. There are now no enemy traces in the Miaoquan area of Bao'an. The enemy in Dapeng Bay, after being met with a head-on assault, suffered a major defeat and fled back to their ships, appearing to be retreating.</p>
<p>"Henan Front": In southern Henan, after our forces briefly recaptured Changtaiguan last week, they continued their fierce attacks, and on the 18th, once again entered the North Gate, inflicting significant casualties. Another of our forces advanced towards Luotuo Shop, approaching the West Gate of Xinyang, and attacked the city with artillery, resulting in intense fighting. Over 2,000 enemy troops in Tongxu, Taiqian, and Dongming counties in eastern Henan were subjected to continuous fierce attacks by our forces. The enemy, attempting to defend on multiple fronts, suffered heavy casualties. Qixian city remains surrounded by our forces. A unit of our surprise troops seized the opportunity to attack the Lanfeng railway station, burning enemy ammunition depots and barracks. Now, all enemy communication lines east of Kaifeng along the Longhai Railway have been cut off by our forces. Several thousand enemy troops in Wuzhi and Muleidian in northern Henan have been launching fierce attacks to the west for days, but have been repeatedly met with head-on assaults, resulting in numerous enemy deaths. The remnants fled back along their original route. The railway between Xinxiang and Anyang and Xiuwu has been completely destroyed by our forces, cutting off their rear and causing extreme panic. Additionally, on the morning of the 21st, enemy troops from Qinyang advanced towards us through Baixiang Town. Our forces launched a timely counterattack, luring the enemy to the vicinity of Guanzhuang, where they were surrounded and annihilated. The enemy abandoned over 300 bodies and fled. There are now no enemy traces in Baixiang Town.</p>
<p>In addition, the great victory in western Suiyuan resulted in the recapture of Baotou and the capture of key points north of Wenling, with over 1,000 enemy soldiers killed. In southern Hebei, we pressed towards Zaoqiang. In Shandong province, we captured Chaocheng and Fanxian, and surrounded Shanghe, Pingdu, and Ye County. In southern Anhui, we besieged Digang and recaptured Jiangyao. In Zou County, we captured Yuanjiaji and Daban Town. In northern Hunan, we captured Wuxingpai. In northern Jiangxi, we defeated the enemy advancing on Zhanggongdu and advanced on Bowu and Ningdu. In Jiangsu province, we recaptured Shucheng Town in Rugao County. In western Zhejiang, we attacked Jiaxing, Jiashan, and Pinghu, controlling traffic on the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway. All of these are important recent victories.

<h3>Guangzhou Newspapers Advocate Anti-British Sentiment</h3>
<p>Guangzhou – The intensity of the anti-British movement in Guangdong province's newspapers has noticeably increased. This morning, a certain newspaper published an article titled "Guangzhou People Demand the Return of the British Concession." The newspaper concluded with a threatening statement: "The people of Guangzhou will carry out very serious actions within one or two days." When some officials were asked about this article, they reportedly did not approve of the outbreak of anti-British activities. Non-official sources believe that the anti-British movement will not extend beyond newspaper advocacy. (Reuters dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<h3>Calculation Standard for Exchange Rate Differences</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The Ministry of Finance's measures for settling and collecting exchange rate differences for exported goods, announced on July 1st and 13th, and the measures for reporting export settlement, have all been stipulated. Foreign exchange earned from the sale of exported goods, after being settled at the legal rate through the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications, may receive from the bank an exchange rate difference equivalent to the difference between the legal rate and the bank's posted rate. Subsequently, due to merchants failing to settle, the method of calculating this exchange rate difference, whether based on the posted rate on the date of signing the foreign exchange purchase certificate or the posted rate on the date of selling the foreign exchange to the bank, was a matter of dispute, and the Trade Commission was requested to interpret it. After considering commercial conditions, the commission submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance for approval. According to investigations, the commission has received an order from the ministry stipulating that all exchange rate differences for export goods should be calculated based on the Bank of China's posted rate on the date the foreign exchange purchase certificate was signed. The bank will indicate the posted rate on the certificate when issuing it, for future reference. This regulation will allow exporters to estimate the costs, profits, and losses of goods, reducing their business risks and encouraging the export of domestic goods, which will greatly benefit the entire export trade.

<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Gaoyou, Seemingly in Retaliation</h3>
<p>Correspondent from Taixian: At 10:00 AM on the 20th, a Japanese bomber suddenly appeared over Gaoyou County, circling the city once before dropping two bombs and flying south. Both bombs landed in empty areas, causing no local damage. The purpose of the Japanese bombing appears to be retaliation for the recent fierce attacks by Chinese forces on Zhaoguan Dam and Shaobo, where the Japanese army suffered heavy losses. They are attempting to disrupt the rear with aerial bombings. However, the morale of the Chinese troops has not been affected.</p>
<h3>Green-Stalked Rice from Qingpu Confiscated in Shanghai; Over 5,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Correspondent from Qingpu: The other day, over 5,000 bags of green-stalked rice from Qingpu, packed into 18 boats, were being transported from Qingpu along the Dayingpu River to Suzhou Creek and then to Shanghai. However, near the Toyota textile factory, they were seized by the Japanese, who claimed that certain procedures had not been followed. Rice merchants are currently in contact with the Japanese. It is heard that rice shops in the countryside have ample rice stocks, and the early rice harvest is about to begin. If the authorities can make every effort to regulate the market, it will not be difficult for rice prices in Shanghai to drop slightly.</p>
<h3>The Tianjin Blockade: A Review of British Interests - Translated from the "Millard's Review of the Far East"</h3>
<p>As this reporter writes, the Tianjin incident has become a matter of prestige. The specific British interests involved, however, have been overlooked. Tianjin, with its British Concession, the only one in North China, and its enjoyment of judicial privileges, is the cornerstone of the British position in the region and a key commercial and distribution center. British interests concentrated in and around Tianjin cover a wide range of activities. This is evident from the names of some of the major British firms operating in the city, such as the Kailan Mining Administration, British-American Tobacco Company, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, Asiatic Petroleum Company, Dunlop Rubber Company, Brunner, Mond &amp; Co., Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Butterfield &amp; Swire, Tianjin Anstie Export Co., and China Soap Company. Recent estimates put the number of British firms operating in Tianjin at 117, with 98 having capital of over 50,000 yuan. In addition to these private organizations, there is the British-run Tianjin British Municipal Council's electric power company, with a generating capacity of 7,500 kilowatts, and a water plant with a daily supply capacity of one million gallons. In 1936, land tax revenue (perhaps around one percent of taxable value) reached 255,746 yuan, and rent tax reached 487,662 yuan, indicating the scale of real estate interests within the concession itself.</p>
<p>The major British interest in Tianjin is trade. New factors arising from the current conflict, such as the redefinition of coastal trade routes, the blockade of other ports, and rising prices, have resulted in changes that cannot be accurately calculated at this time. However, available statistics can still indicate the importance of Tianjin to British trade and serve as a basis for comparison with the pre-war situation. British ships held the top position at the port of Tianjin until 1938, when they were surpassed by Japanese vessels and relegated to second place. Last year, the total tonnage of British ships entering and leaving Tianjin was 1,763,461 tons, of which 1,355,706 tons were coastal vessels. This total is still an increase of 299,461 tons over 1937, and 49,230 tons more than in 1936.</p>
<p>Similarly, during this decisive conflict, the total value of British exports from Tianjin has not decreased. Instead, it has increased from 10,379,840 yuan in 1936 to 11,738,520 yuan in 1938. However, during the same period, the value of Tianjin's exports to Japan increased from 28,440,410 yuan to 78,210,785 yuan (exports to the United States decreased from 44,285,017 yuan to 31,257,541 yuan). In 1938, Tianjin's major exports to the United Kingdom were livestock and livestock products, mostly bristles, eggs, and egg products (7,029,770 yuan), hides, leather, and skins (478,513 yuan), seeds, mostly almonds (513,475 yuan), and textile fibers and products, mostly wool (2,928,470 yuan).</p>
<p>The war has had different effects on this trade. Hides, leather, and skins, seeds, textile fibers and products, and bristles all decreased between 1936 and 1938. Only seeds have recovered from their 1937 position. The most serious impact on British interests has been the decline in wool exports, largely due to Japanese monopolization of wool. However, the increase in exports of livestock and livestock products, particularly eggs and egg products, has more than compensated for this loss.</p>
<p>British goods imported into Tianjin in 1938 amounted to 3,538,535 gold units (one gold unit is equivalent to 2.26 yuan or approximately 68 US cents before devaluation), compared to 3,539,849 gold units in 1937 and 2,851,235 gold units in 1936, a slight increase. Imports of Japanese goods, however, increased rapidly from 11,992,151 gold units in 1936 to 54,436,018 gold units in 1938. The increase in American imports during the same period was not as rapid as that of Japanese goods, increasing from 3,926,565 gold units to 9,158,510 gold units. The most important items of British goods imported into Tianjin in 1938 were white and dyed cotton cloth (65,556 gold units), wool and woolen products (399,608 gold units), metals and ores (955,567 gold units), vehicles and ships (122,853 gold units), metal sundries (101,301 gold units), chemicals and pharmaceuticals (723,940 gold units), dyes, pigments, and paints (58,517 gold units), and books, maps, paper, and wood pulp (46,360 gold units).</p>
<p>Wool and woolen products, dyes, pigments, paints, books, maps, paper, and wood pulp have all decreased sharply, while metals and ores, as well as chemicals and pharmaceuticals, have increased dramatically. Among many other less important items—such as tobacco, wine, beer, liquor, candles, soap, kerosene, fats, wax, gums, resins, and leather—although the amounts are smaller, they have all increased significantly.</p>
<p>Actions such as the establishment of export monopolies, the prohibition of certain exports, foreign exchange controls, revisions of tax rates to favor Japanese products, discriminatory treatment in granting railway access, and inadequate telegraph services have all hampered and harmed British interests. However, the British commercial position in Tianjin, until the recent crisis, has remained strong. The blockade of the concession itself poses an unparalleled danger to British interests.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Threatens Hong Kong; British Officer Says Hong Kong Can Hold Out for Nine Months</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondent: The Japanese army has again invaded Shenzhen and has issued threatening statements against Hong Kong. Therefore, the question of how long Hong Kong's military preparations can last during a crisis is of great concern to the general public. Recently, a reporter from the London Sketch visited Hong Kong and, based on his observations, expressed optimism. Now, retired British Army Colonel Robinson has also expressed his views, strongly asserting that Hong Kong's defense can be maintained for at least nine months. Colonel Robinson retired on July 26th of last year and returned home in August. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the London Daily Telegraph, directly refuting rumors that Hong Kong's defense capabilities are weak, calling them ignorant. The letter listed Hong Kong's military equipment on both the offensive and defensive sides in great detail. The letter briefly stated that anyone familiar with the situation in the Far East can confidently declare to anyone, whether friend or foe, that Hong Kong is by no means indefensible. To say that it is indefensible is a fallacy. In terms of Hong Kong's military preparations, even if it were completely surrounded, it could be defended for at least nine months. As for naval attacks, the coastal forts are extremely strong and powerful, and a large number of submarines are active and can handle any situation. If the enemy wants to land or attack from the mainland, they will also meet strong resistance. It would take them months or even years to succeed.</p>
<h3>Chinese Forces in Northern Jiangsu Re-Enter Lianshui City and Approach Huai'an and Huaibei</h3>
<p>Correspondent from Taixian: The Chinese forces in northern Jiangsu have been vigorously reorganized by the authorities, and after a considerable period of training, their morale is high and their strength is abundant. On the anniversary of "August 13th", they launched an offensive against the Japanese army on all fronts, north and south, achieving good results in the following days. In the Lianshui area, they have re-entered the county seat. In the Huai'an and Huaibei areas, they also hold a very advantageous position. According to reports from the front, a certain unit of the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army in Dongchen Town, Rugao, at dawn on the 13th, engaging the Japanese army in fierce fighting. The Japanese army initially held their strong fortifications, stubbornly resisting, but the Chinese army, undeterred, finally drove the Japanese army back at 3:00 AM on the 13th. Dongchen Town was officially recovered by the Chinese army. After the Japanese army fled back to Rugao City, they closed their gates and defended it to the death. The Japanese in Huaian and Lianshui have been subjected to repeated counterattacks by the Chinese army for several days. The Japanese special services agency has ordered Japanese merchants, prostitutes, and various looted goods to be transported to Suqian as quickly as possible, and they have been busy transporting them in recent days. Also, a certain brigade of the Chinese army launched an attack on the Japanese army in Jijia City and Gushan Town at dawn on the 13th, encountering the Japanese army. The Chinese army charged bravely. A unit of a certain regiment occupied Gushan Town. The main force of the Chinese army engaged in fierce street fighting with the Japanese army defending Jijia City. The Japanese army, unable to hold out, disregarded humanitarian principles and released poison gas shells, which was extremely brutal. The morale of the Chinese army is extremely high, and they continue to surround and annihilate the Japanese army in Jijiashi.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants in Nanjing Hoarding Copper Coins and Subsidiary Currency; Branches Established in Xuzhou and Bengbu</h3>
<p>Nanjing Correspondent: Since Shanghai suddenly experienced a shortage of copper coins and fractional currency, the market has been greatly affected. The counties in the Shanghai-Nanjing occupied areas have also suffered the same situation. Copper coins in Nanjing have all been collected by Japanese merchants. The organizations specializing in collecting copper coins and subsidiary currency are the Meizhong and Xingzhong money exchanges on Zhonghua Road, and the Takahashi branch of Japanese merchants on Taiping Road and Guofu Road. All of these are branches of the Japanese merchant Ishifuku. They collect over a thousand yuan in copper coins every day. Their scope is very broad. In addition to Nanjing, branches have also been established in Xuzhou and Bengbu. Furthermore, the Japanese Fujiya on Zhongshan Road secretly purchases copper coins and ships them to Shanghai and then to Japan. The Nanjing money industry association has investigated the facts and reported them to the headquarters of the Japanese military special services agency, requesting that it be banned. However, the special services agency feigned ignorance and did not take action.</p>

<h3>Japan Takes a Cautious Attitude Towards the Situation in Shanghai; Threatens Action But Not Blockade; Yamada's Speech Reveals Desire for Peace; Shanghai Rumors All Baseless</h3>
<p>High-ranking figures in the Japanese Central China Army recently answered reporters' questions regarding the rumor that the Japanese would blockade the concessions, claiming there were "several policies." The Japanese authorities stationed in Shanghai may take action. He continued that he could not say for sure what methods the Japanese authorities would take, but in his opinion, there was no indication of any isolation measures similar to Tianjin. However, he had told people on Monday that "Japanese naval and military authorities are now quite serious and cautious in their consideration of newly occurring sudden events." He firmly believed that the final outcome of any event must be handled by the Japanese military authorities. Furthermore, Yamada, the commander of the Japanese Central China Army, invited Western reporters yesterday. The details are as follows. Yamada, the commander of the Japanese Central China Army, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday and invited foreign reporters yesterday to deliver a speech. It was generally speculated that he would express opinions related to the situation in Shanghai. Because the Berlin wireless broadcast news the day before yesterday claimed that the Japanese would soon blockade Shanghai, many Western reporters were eager to attend. Yamada did not mention a word about the situation in Shanghai. Japanese briefings for reporters were usually held at 5:00 PM, but yesterday it was specially moved earlier.</p>
<p>The occasion expressed an unwillingness for war</p>
<p>It was held at 10:30 AM in the Japanese naval attaché's office on Rue D'esperey. During the session, Yamada vigorously promoted "peace," speaking eloquently about the need for cooperation and expressing his dislike for war. Japan did not want to bomb China or harm third-country nationals or their interests, etc. The situation was different from the previous "news briefing meetings." It was widely believed that after Japan was abandoned by Germany, the world no longer had any country to side with it, and it was in a state of panic. It had no choice but to slightly ease its pressure on Britain, deliberately spreading an atmosphere of peace to observe the changes.</p>
<p>Rumors have absolutely no basis</p>
<p>The North China Daily News said that (on the 23rd) Shanghai was rife with rumors, spreading throughout the two concessions, causing anxiety among merchants and citizens and causing considerable tension. There was talk in the clubs, pubs, and other meeting places, all discussing the future of Shanghai following the European situation. Those in charge of identifying these rumors included some Japanese military personnel, the Municipal Council, and the Consular authorities. They confirmed that they were rumors, including the occupation of certain parts of the western district of the Public Concession by the Japanese army, the accumulation of Japanese troops in the areas near the Public Concession, and the landing of Japanese reinforcements. However, many people seemed intent on spreading them, causing considerable agitation among Chinese and foreign citizens here. Yesterday afternoon, when asked whether the Japanese would invade the Public Concession, a semi-official Japanese source said that this may not happen. The general feeling in informed circles here is also that the Japanese will not take this action. According to Municipal Council officials, they have heard all the rumors. Although the Japanese issued a statement on Tuesday saying that they were planning strict measures, they had no factual basis to clarify all the rumors.</p>
<p>Japanese troops will take several measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Colonel Mabuchi, the head of the Chinese Army Press Corps, disclosed last night (the 23rd) while answering questions from journalists regarding rumors of an impending blockade of the Shanghai Public Concession, that the Japanese military authorities would take "several measures" in Shanghai. According to him, he could not say exactly what measures the Japanese military would take, but in his opinion, it was unlikely that they would "immediately take any steps similar to those in Tianjin." Since the Japanese army and navy announced on Tuesday that they were deeply concerned about recent unfortunate incidents, he believed that "the Japanese military authorities will eventually take some action." When asked about rumors that 10,000 to 12,000 Japanese soldiers had recently arrived in Shanghai from North China, Mabuchi replied that he could not comment on this, "because any military action is a military secret."</p>
<p>Bizarre News from Berlin Broadcast</p>
<p>Regarding the rumors of a blockade that have been unsettling Shanghai for the past two days, a foreigner said last night that he received a news broadcast from Berlin at 5:30 PM local time, broadcast at 10:30 AM Berlin time, stating that according to news from Shanghai, the blockade of the Public Concession was imminent. The Berlin announcer also stated that, according to foreign sources, the Japanese had already blockaded the Huangpu River for an hour to allow 10,000 troops to land.</p>
<p>British troops on patrol are merely on alert</p>
<p>At the same time, it was reported that British troops from the East Surrey Regiment were patrolling along the western boundary of the concessions last night. According to those in charge, these troops are merely on alert. There is nothing unusual about their activities in the western district. Yesterday afternoon, rumors spread that Japanese military police had begun patrolling the roads outside the boundaries. This has been denied by the police. However, they acknowledged that Japanese military police did appear on the roads outside the boundary yesterday, merely to install telephone wires.</p>
<p>Municipal Council Replied to Japanese Consulate's Communication</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that at the Japanese reception for journalists yesterday (the 23rd), it was revealed that regarding the shooting case on Rue D'esperey involving concession police and "Greater Shanghai Municipal Police," the Japanese Consul General Miura sent a letter of protest to Municipal Council Secretary-General Fessenden on Tuesday. Fessenden replied to Miura on the same day, requesting that the Japanese authorities investigate. His reply to the "Shanghai Special Municipal Government" stated that the results of the investigation by the Public Concession authorities differed from the results of the Japanese investigation. The Public Concession authorities hoped that all evidence should be examined by a third party and that both sides should first agree on this step. The reply concluded by saying that Miura had correctly requested a postponement of the return of public concession police to the area north of the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<p>Kimurik's Room is Closely Guarded</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that after Kimurik, the western inspector of the police, was hospitalized in the Country Hospital for treatment, two plainclothes Japanese military police attempted to enter his room. To prevent a possible intrusion by the Japanese military police in the future, it was decided to station a detective from the western precinct outside Kimurik's room. It was also reported that the authorities had strictly ordered that only police officers and those holding special passes would be allowed to enter the room. A reporter who wanted to confirm this report made a phone call to the Country Hospital yesterday (the 23rd) to inquire, and the hospital said to ask the police. Although it had been known since Sunday morning that British troops were stationed outside Kimurik's room, the reason for this security measure was not confirmed by those in charge until yesterday. Kimurik was injured by a plainclothes policeman while questioning the "Greater Shanghai Municipal Police" on Rue D'esperey.</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Free Transportation to Shanghai: Agreement Reached and Implementation to Follow Soon. Japanese Side Expresses Doubt About Rice Shortage in Shanghai, but Acknowledges Difficulties in Transporting Rice from the Interior. Various Groups Agree on Methods for Ordering Foreign Rice.</h3>
<p>The English-language *North China Daily News* reports: Official sources indicate that the Shanghai Municipal Council is currently negotiating with the Japanese authorities regarding increasing the allowance for rice and grain transported into the two concessions. Once discussions are completed, it is expected that implementation will follow soon, restoring normalcy to matters concerning rice and grain.</p>
<p>Japanese Observation of Rice Shortage Reasons</p>
<p>*Continental Daily News* reports: Colonel Mabuchi, head of the Japanese Army press corps in Central China, stated at a press conference yesterday (23rd) that if the Public Concession authorities cannot find a solution to the rice and grain question in the city, it will be time for the Japanese to take over. If Public Concession officials are unable or refuse to act, potentially causing disturbances that disrupt the peace and order of Shanghai and its suburbs, the Japanese authorities feel compelled to take appropriate measures to resolve the rice and grain problem. Regarding the "so-called rice shortage," the Japanese authorities are quite frustrated, yet they doubt the term "shortage" is entirely accurate. Mabuchi continued, stating that there is actually no such shortage, as speculators, even the Public Concession authorities, are constantly hoarding large quantities of rice and grain. The extremely high rice prices are causing harm. He believes that the Public Concession authorities and merchants, acting out of self-interest with such astonishing measures, should resolve this problem.</p>
<p>Acknowledging Japanese Tax Obstacles</p>
<p>At this point, a certain foreign journalist suggested that a key point in alleviating the rice shortage would be for the Japanese to permit the free entry of rice and grain from their occupied areas into Shanghai without levying harsh taxes. In response, Mabuchi acknowledged that this would certainly be one way to alleviate the shortage of rice and other goods. However, the relationship between the Public Concession and areas outside the concession presents many obstacles. The Japanese military authorities feel that the first step in easing the situation is to improve the atmosphere within the Public Concession. Asked if the Japanese would allow rice to be transported from Wuhu and other areas with large rice stocks into Shanghai, given that millions of Chinese urgently need rice and grain, he replied that if the situation were truly that dire, action would have to be taken to address it. Most people do not understand how difficult it is to transport rice from one place to another; even the Japanese army suffers from such difficulties. However, this problem, along with "similar problems," is currently under consideration by the Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>Registering Required Before Ordering Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Further news: Various Shanghai groups, in order to maintain the food supply for Shanghai residents, have decided to order foreign rice to be transported to Shanghai for relief. Initiators Yu Qiaqing, Gui Yanfang, Zhang Jiguang, Wang Yuqing, Guo Shun, and others met at the Shipping Club at 12:00 noon yesterday to discuss methods for ordering foreign rice. They stipulated that groups, organizations, companies, and firms wishing to order foreign rice must first obtain a registration form from the Accountants' Association, with a minimum order of 100 bags.</p>
<p>Registration Procedures Agreed Upon</p>
<p>(1) Groups, organizations, companies, and firms wishing to order Saigon rice should go to the Shanghai Accountants' Association, located on the fourth floor of the Pudong Native Place Association on Avenue Edward VII (telephone 35900), to obtain a registration form and fill it out according to the instructions. (2) After a sufficient quantity has been registered, an order will be telegraphed overseas. The initiators will convene a meeting of those who have placed orders to discuss methods and select custodians. (3) The price of Saigon rice and transportation costs will be investigated and determined by the initiators. Those placing orders should pay at least 50% of the price when placing the order, with the remainder to be paid based on the final settlement. (4) Those placing orders may not cancel their ordered quantity. (5) The minimum order quantity is 100 bags. (6) Collection matters will be handled by a bank designated by the initiators. Initiators: Yu Qiaqing, Gui Yanfang, Zhang Jiguang, Guo Shun, Wang Yuqing; Accounting Advisors: Yu Yushu, Wang Haifan, Li Wenjie.</p>

The form for registering to order Saigon rice is as follows: (1) Ordering Organization, (2) Representative, (3) Address and Telephone, (4) Quantity Ordered (how many bags, each bag containing 1.25 piculs), (5) Declaration: (i) The registration methods for ordering Saigon rice established by the initiators have been read and are willing to comply. (ii) All methods will be handled according to the decisions of the initiators. Ordering Organization (seal), Representative (signature and seal), Republic of China, year, month, day.</p>
<p>Advising Against Further Increases in Noodle Prices</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Mechanized Noodle Industry Association requesting restrictions on noodle prices, in order to care for their well-being. The Chamber of Commerce immediately forwarded a letter to the Shanghai Flour Mill Industry Association, stating: "Recently, rice prices in the city have been extraordinarily high, and the general working class mostly purchases noodles to satisfy their hunger. The Mechanized Noodle Industry Association relies on selling noodles for a living. If flour prices continue to rise, it will greatly affect the operations of the noodle industry and the lives of the working-class citizens. Accordingly, this is communicated to you in the hope that your Association will take this into consideration, inform your colleagues, empathize with the difficulty of people getting food, and refrain from further increases in noodle prices. This is our deepest hope."</p>
<p>Soybean and Rice Industry Sets Provisional Price Limits</p>
<p>The Soybean and Rice Market Management Committee convened its 44th meeting yesterday morning, with the participation of representatives from the Hakka community, Chen Ziyi representing the General Chamber of Commerce, and committee members Zhang Lizhong, Zhang Yin’nan, Cai Shengming, Zheng Shengyun, and others, totaling fourteen people. The Hakka representatives included Wei Yueqing, Zhu Qiuiong, Zhang Songtao, Shi Zufu, Cai Weixiang, and others, totaling seven people. The meeting was chaired by Fu Qian’geng and recorded by Wang Jiting. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, and Chen Ziyi, representing the General Chamber of Commerce, gave guidance, briefly stating that the current situation in the Shanghai rice market differs from the limited price by more than double, causing market disorder and suffering for ordinary people. Recently, Mr. Yu Qiaxiang, a prominent figure in Shanghai, invited various national groups and groups to order 5,000 tons (equivalent to 50,000 bags) of foreign rice. On one hand, the Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to request assistance from the Special District authorities in facilitating supply sources to ensure abundant goods and stable prices. Furthermore, during this time of seasonal scarcity, we should exercise self-restraint, consider the food supply for the city's five million residents, and assuage the people's longing. Subsequently, gathering opinions from various individuals, provisional price limits were set: the highest price for white japonica rice should not exceed 40 yuan, and the highest price for indica rice should not exceed 35 yuan. If these provisional prices are exceeded, a complaint box will be set up for anyone to report violations. If violations are discovered, they will be immediately reported to the Special District authorities and publicized in the newspapers, requesting social sanctions.</p>
<p>White Rice Arrives in Shanghai, Lowering Prices in the Interior</p>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, yesterday afternoon, Heli Shipping Company transported over 30 boats of white rice from Songjiang, each boat carrying 170-180 dan, totaling over 5,000 dan, which has been unloaded in batches ashore. It is also learned that the various townships outside Songjiang city simultaneously (on the 24th) received orders from the Chinese Guerrilla Area County Government to implement price stabilization, at 1 jiao per jin (equivalent to 16 yuan per dan). Each person is limited to purchasing 3 jin, and upon purchase, the rice must be soaked in water to prevent hoarding.</p>
<h3>Problem of Rent Increase by the Jianye Company</h3>
<p>The French-owned China Construction and Land Company, which owns properties throughout the French Concession, already increased rents by 20% after August 13th. Recently, it notified tenants in various alleyways that rents would be increased by another 30% starting in September. The tenants unanimously opposed this, as detailed in this newspaper. It is now learned that the company's manager is aware that it is not appropriate to increase rents in the current environment, especially with residents leaving the Concession in increasing numbers. Yesterday, he indicated to tenants in Wanyi Alley that he would be willing to reduce the increase by 20%, raising rents by only 10%. The tenants in that alleyway are currently seriously considering this offer.</p>

<h3>An Open Letter (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>In the twenty-one months that I have been away from Shanghai, I have spent eighteen months traveling to various places in the front and rear. In the past year, I have traveled extensively in the rear. Allow me to select and tell you about what I have recently seen and heard.</p>
<p>What inspires people the most everywhere is the populace. After more than two years of resistance, traveling throughout the rear, I have never heard the populace utter a single complaint about the long war or the hard war. Whether it is the requisition of the populace's wealth or physical strength, as long as it is explained clearly that it is for the sake of resistance, there is absolutely no reaction to any sacrifice. Recently, in a certain place, I visited an aircraft construction project. More than five thousand workers, without much training, were inspired by a speech by the organizer, explaining the close relationship between aviation construction and the resistance and its great contribution. They came before the start time; they did not leave when the closing time came. The seventy-day deadline was completed in less than sixty days. That day I stood on a high platform and spoke a few words that stimulated the masses - Gentlemen, what is the soil that you carry on your shoulders every day, that you dig out shovel by shovel, and that you trample under your feet? Gentlemen, remember, this is the land of the Republic of China, the land that our millions of soldiers and tens of millions of compatriots are willing to protect with their blood and flesh! Gentlemen, your pearl-like sweat, dripping on this bright and splendid land, what glory! -- Before I finished speaking, the entire crowd of five thousand people suddenly erupted in a great shout of joy, as if they were crazy. Is not that enough to show the fervent anti-Japanese sentiments of our general populace in the interior and in the frontier?</p>
<p>The youth show it very clearly. Wherever I travel, in almost any town, I will come across students who have joined the army, and they are all volunteers. Visiting their families, reading the letters they sent home from the army, all kinds of expressions, both loyalty and filial piety, if you are human, you can't help but be moved to tears. I only think that the standard of being a person has been raised in the future. We can only feel ashamed to be like us! (Try reading my recent work "Facts of the Populace's Fervent Patriotism Received from Inspection in the Interior" (Guoxun, Issue 209)). In the early stage of the resistance, Guangxi was the first to show it, and now it has almost spread everywhere. In the early stage of the resistance, youths volunteered to join the army, and they secretly hid it from their parents. Now the parents' mentality has also changed. I was comforting the families of soldiers in a certain place on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and I met the mother of a little hero named Shang Binru. I asked: Binru joined the army, didn't you stop him? She replied: He is doing his part for the country, how can I stop him? In a certain place, there was a Mrs. Liu whose son joined the volunteer army without telling his mother. His mother accidentally saw her son marching in the crowd. She asked others what was going on. They replied that they were going to fight the Japanese. The old lady Liu was very excited and bought a few feet of red silk, personally draped it on her son's back, and followed him, causing a sensation in the entire local society as a good story. There are too many stories like this to tell.</p>
<p>In the past year, the populace's ability has been fully demonstrated on the front lines. Everyone knows that the areas north of Hubei and south of Henan, and the areas north of Henan and south of Shanxi, are only able to prevent the Japanese from advancing because the populace and the army cooperated extremely closely and the two sides' forces were coordinated extremely harmoniously, resulting in great achievements. The Japanese either advance decisively or retreat decisively. This is of course the bravery of the army in battle, but the populace "also has a force in it." In the future, wherever the Japanese cavalry goes, it will probably be the best opportunity for the populace to show its strength.</p>
<p>As for politics, I dare to say that under the guidance of the highest leader in charge of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, we are always moving step by step on the path of improvement. Since the War of Resistance, the railway and postal services have been the most outstanding performers of service in the most difficult and dangerous times. Recently, I was traveling in the southwestern border region. There is a place called "Two Umbrellas." It is truly "remote." I happened to find a post office box. I loved the unique name of the place, and I wanted to test the performance of the postal service. I wrote a few postcards and sent them from Two Umbrellas to various places, and I asked for a reply. Then, one by one, I received replies. I can't help but sigh that the postal organization is indeed strict. When I returned to Chongqing, it was just in time for a Japanese air raid. The air defense organization was indeed much more advanced than before. Chongqing has a joint emergency relief office. Following its guidance, citizens almost completely hide with agile and orderly movements at the sound of an alarm. What is commendable is that a group of service teams and fire brigades bravely risked danger to rush to the rescue. The director-general of the office personally directed the scene every time. A incendiary bomb landed without exploding, and in an instant, sand was covered on it, so it would not burn. A car company, whose neighbor was bombed, had a large amount of gasoline stored. In an instant, it was safely taken out. These are all their achievements in bravely risking danger. One director-general was pressed under a collapsed house, but he was unharmed. These are all facts that I personally saw and heard. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Rapid Change in International Situation: Public Bonds Surge, Japanese and German Currencies Plummet, Soviet Currency Rises: Small Rebound in Gold Market Due to Foreigners Buying</h3>
<p>Since Germany and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact, the international situation has changed, and the financial market has suddenly become active. Unified public bonds began to surge the day before yesterday, from one yuan and five cents to one yuan and a half. By yesterday morning, various newspapers reported that the German Foreign Minister had officially gone to Moscow to sign the agreement. The city's securities market believed that the international situation was rapidly changing and moving in a favorable direction. Furthermore, victories were repeatedly reported from the war zones between our country and Japan. Therefore, market confidence became firm. Thus, the prices of unified public bonds continued to rise. In the morning, Class A was 50 yuan and 8 jiao, Class B was 14 yuan and 6 jiao, Class C was 42 yuan and 3 jiao 5 fen, Class D was 41 yuan and 4 jiao, and Class E was 41 yuan and 8 jiao 5 fen, generally rising by 5-6 jiao compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, prices slightly declined. It is predicted that they will continue to rise within the day.</p>
<p>Gold Market Rebounds Slightly After Sharp Drop</p>
<p>The city's cash market prices are based on telegram reports from the international market. If there are drastic changes in one or two countries in the world, whether in military, political, or economic aspects, gold prices will fall or rise accordingly. The day before yesterday, the gold market plunged sharply due to the German-Soviet agreement and the serious European situation, falling by about 570 yuan. Yesterday, the gold market rebounded slightly in unofficial trading. In the morning, it was 3,990 yuan, and in the afternoon, it was 4,200 yuan, a slight improvement of 200 yuan compared to the previous day. The reason is that foreigners in Shanghai, fearing the outbreak of war in Europe, are converting pounds and other currencies of countries involved in the conflict into large bars of cash. According to gold market insiders, during the First World War, gold prices fell to more than 20 yuan per tael. If the German-Polish incident leads to a Second World War, gold prices will inevitably plummet. The sharp drop in the past two days is symbolic of this. As of yesterday, the unofficial foreign exchange market also turned slightly looser. The British exchange rate was 3 shillings and 25 pence, and the U.S. exchange rate was 6 yuan and 93.75 fen, while the HSBC market quoted the British exchange rate at 3 shillings and 68.75 pence, and the U.S. exchange rate at 7 yuan and 18.75 fen.</p>
<p>German and Japanese Currencies Plunge</p>
<p>German gold bonds (i.e., mark bonds) had repeatedly risen after the successful invasion of Czechoslovakia. Now, due to the country's aggressive actions against Poland, the gold bonds and gold pounds have suddenly fallen sharply. Yesterday, German gold bonds were only 1 yuan and 1 jiao, a drop of more than 3.5 jiao compared to the previous day and more than 7 jiao compared to last week. Gold pounds were only 90 yuan, a much smaller drop than before. Japanese old man tickets have been falling in the past two days, only about 1 yuan and 1 jiao, a drop of 3-4 jiao compared to last week. As for Soviet gold pounds, they have risen to 96 yuan, and gold bonds have risen to about 4 jiao.</p>

<h3>Remains of Dane Krogh Cremated; His Wife Sobbed Uncontrollably</h3>
<p>After the director of the business department of the Great Northern Telegraph Company, the Dane Krogh, was shot and killed by bandits last Friday morning, his remains were cremated at the Western Cemetery on Jing'an Temple Road at 5:30 PM on the 23rd. Thousands of people attended, including British Army Commander General Simmons, the Danish Consul General in Shanghai, all foreign members of the Great Northern Company, the Shanghai Fire Brigade, and all members of Company A of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.

<h3>Completion of Telegraphic Transfer Allotment; Obtaining Becomes More Stringent: Preventing Speculation While Prices Soar; Increased Capital Makes Various Industries More Active</h3>
<p>After the implementation of the new telegraphic transfer system, the Bank Joint Reserve Committee, in order to prevent speculation, avoid soaring prices, and affect people's livelihood, strictly handled the acquisition and use of such transfers. The method for distributing telegraphic transfers to firms has now been completed. The market is being strengthened by increased capital, making various industries more active. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Completion of Telegraphic Transfer Allotment</p>
<p>The Bank Joint Reserve Committee has temporarily set the total amount of interbank telegraphic transfers to be acquired by various firms at 50 million national currency. Banks, money houses, trust companies, and other institutions have provided collateral to the Committee to obtain these transfers for circulation in the market. In order to avoid encouraging speculation and hoarding to prevent soaring prices, the Committee decided to handle the process strictly. It has now fully considered the actual needs of various firms, trust companies, etc., and completed the allocation of the number of interbank transfers to be acquired. (1) 20 million yuan to the four central banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture; (2) 20 million yuan to various banks and trust companies; (3) 10 million yuan to various money houses.</p>
<p>Firms Acquire and Circulate</p>
<p>A total of more than 110 banks, money houses, and trust companies are authorized to acquire interbank transfers from the Bank Joint Reserve Committee. As of August 17, the total amount of transfers acquired by various firms and trust companies was 14,751,100 yuan. The assessed value of the collateral was 25,565,208 yuan. As for the three central banks of China, China, and Communications, they acquired and paid for the telegraphic transfers due to the payment of the seventh installment of principal and interest on unified public bonds at the end of July. It is reported that the amount acquired was 10 million yuan. The issuance of transfer certificates by the Committee has been temporarily postponed.</p>
<p>Increased Capital Makes Various Industries Active</p>
<p>The Silver and Money Industries Association previously agreed with the three central banks of China, China, and Communications to adjust interbank funds. The interbank transfer deposits previously deposited by the various firms in the bank reserve and money industry reserve totaled 22 million yuan. Since July 4 of this year, they have been converted into legal currency for circulation, divided into twelve weeks. Eight installments have now been released, each installment being 1.8 million yuan, totaling 14.4 million yuan. In addition to increasing the capital of new transfers in the market, it also increased the capital of cash, thus various industries have become more active and greatly benefited.</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Sand and Stone Workers Unemployed; Request for Relief: Sand and Stone Industry Unable to Help; Workers Strike Entirely Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the sand and stone from the Sijiao Islands have been monopolized and prevented from being unloaded by the "Jiangnan Company," sand junk boats have suffered heavy losses and are unwilling to continue loading and transporting. As a result, the demand for various industries in Shanghai has come to a standstill. The sand and stone industry has been unable to buy or sell, and has been suspended for more than a month. More than a thousand workers carrying sand and stone at various docks are paid by the job. Although a few have been transporting to Shanghai through indirect means, the number of porters is too high, which is not enough for the workers. Most of them have been unemployed because there is no cargo to carry. Therefore, at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, representatives Fang Jinxiang, Liu Yucai, and others, totaling more than 30 people, prepared a letter to the sand and stone industry tea party, requesting the capitalists of the industry to find ways to maintain their livelihoods. After temporary deliberations by the industry's committee members, they expressed their rejection of the workers' request, as they themselves were finding it difficult to maintain their operations after the suspension of mining, transportation, and junk boats. The workers announced a complete strike yesterday. In addition to reporting the situation to the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Sand and Stone Association also requested the Department's assistance in negotiations (Note: The road-building sand and stone of the Public Works Department is also supplied by the industry. After the transportation is cut off, road-building projects will also be forced to stop).</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Yakumo and Iwate Suddenly Enter Port Again; American Warship Marblehead Enters Port and Anchors Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Japanese warships Yakumo and Iwate arrived on the 20th and were anchored at the Mitsubishi Wharf and buoys 1 and 2. The circumstances of their departure from Shanghai the day before yesterday morning (23rd) were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the two ships suddenly re-entered port yesterday morning and are still anchored in their original locations, forming a tripod with the Izumo, which is noteworthy. Also, the American naval cruiser Marblehead, a large ship with four smokestacks, arrived in Shanghai at 6:30 AM yesterday. She anchored in front of the New Customs House (i.e., the place where the former American flagship Augusta anchored). It is reported that after the ship is supplied, it will return to North China.</p>
<h3>Four Banks Move to Yunnan: Preparations Underway; Qian Xinzhi and Others Fly to Chongqing</h3>
<p>The headquarters of the four banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China, were located in Shanghai before the war. After the war, they were ordered to move to Chongqing, and Shanghai was changed to a branch. Now, the Ministry of Finance has ordered that they all be moved to Kunming. Kunming is now the hub of trade between China and Southwest countries and the center of Chinese industry and commerce. The reporter of the New Sound Society learned from the banking sector that the four banks have prepared to move to Kunming. Bei Songsun, manager of the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China, and Qian Xinzhi, general manager of the Bank of Communications, flew to Chongqing the day before yesterday to prepare for the move.</p>
<h3>Using Recruitment as a Pretext to Entice Young Men: Authorities Discern the Conspiracy and Establish Preventive Measures</h3>
<p>Since a certain party is using recruitment as a pretext to entice young men to transport them to the outside of the Customs to serve as soldiers, the authorities have discerned the conspiracy and established preventive measures for compliance. (1) The county governments in the war zones will post notices in various towns and villages, informing them that what a certain party calls recruitment of workers is actually transporting them outside the Customs to serve as soldiers, and then transporting them back inside the Customs to fight. (2) To supplement the effectiveness of the notices, the county governments should also recruit intellectuals and young students to organize political work teams or propaganda teams to go to various villages to do propaganda work. (3) In areas under the control of a certain party, the administrative inspector's office should organize another propaganda team to cooperate with the guerrillas to post notices and carry out propaganda work. (4) In areas under the control of Chinese military forces, counties should establish righteous people's shelters to receive those who flee from areas under the other party's control because they do not want to be drafted. (5) For the righteous people who flee, they should be either incorporated into the ranks according to their wishes and participate in the war of resistance after receiving military training, or assigned to military transportation work.</p>

<h3>The Money Exchange Industry Association Requests to Exchange 100,000 Yuan in Subsidiary Coin Notes: Calculated at 1,000 Yuan Per Member: Awaiting Approval From the Central Bank</h3>
<p>The Money Exchange Industry Association recently noted that the Central Bank of China's Shanghai branch is about to issue new subsidiary coin notes of one and five cents. To facilitate the exchange procedures for its members, it sent a letter to the Central Bank yesterday requesting the bank to allow the Association to represent its members in exchanging the new coins. The original letter stated that the members were feeling the inconvenience of using stamps and that the exchange was causing complaints. As your bank is about to issue 500,000 yuan in new coins, our Association requests that each member be allowed to exchange 1,000 yuan. There are more than 100 member money houses, so a total of 100,000 yuan in new coins will be needed to meet business needs. It is heard that the letter has been properly presented to the bank by the person in charge of the Association. Now, each money house is eagerly awaiting a reply so that they can gather funds and carry out the exchange as requested.</p>
<h3>East Hanbi Road, Hongkou: Robbers Injure Person</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at approximately 6:00 PM, within Lane 342 of Dong Hanbi Road, Hongkou, a man surnamed Mou, residing within the lane, was stabbed by robbers. As the man was about to exit the lane, two robbers suddenly jumped out from hiding and seized him. One robber brandished a gun, while the other held a sharp blade. They both demanded the gold ring on his hand. The man, unwilling to part with it, attempted to evade them, but was eventually caught up. One robber stabbed him fiercely in the abdomen with the blade, causing him to fall to the ground in pain. The two robbers then snatched the gold ring and fled. Fortunately, a passerby witnessed the incident and reported it to the police, who sent the injured man to the hospital for treatment. His condition is critical.</p>
<h3>Rice-Snatching Incidents</h3>
<p>Huade Road: At approximately 9:00 AM yesterday, a rice shop located at No. 383 Huade Road, Hongkou, was raided by thirty to forty impoverished men and women who snatched rice. The shop had just opened for business and was unable to stop them. Approximately two and a half dan of white rice were taken. The shop urgently called for help, but by the time the detectives arrived, the crowd had dispersed. Only the last person was apprehended and taken to the police station for investigation.</p>
<p>Xinzha Road: At approximately 7:25 PM yesterday, Wanghe Rice Shop, located at No. 206, Lane 51, Xinwenqiao Road, Xinzha Road, was suddenly stormed by over a hundred impoverished people on the verge of starvation, who snatched over seven dan of white rice. The shop staff, seeing the overwhelming force and large number of people, were unable to stop them and could only let them proceed. After about twenty minutes, they finally left, but detectives had already arrived upon hearing the news. They arrested the last person to leave and confiscated a small bag of white rice in his possession, taking him to the police station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Ban on Import of Foreign Goods: Private Carrying Prohibited</h3>
<p>Flexibility Allowed for Customs Duties Under One Yuan</p>
<p>Following the Ministry of Finance's announcement of measures to prohibit the import of foreign goods during the extraordinary period, customs offices across the country have been ordered to implement them. However, customs offices in occupied areas such as Shanghai have not yet complied due to the special circumstances. Now, the Ministry has ordered that in the future, foreign goods carried in travelers' luggage that are prohibited from import shall still be permitted for import if the customs duty payable is less than one Customs Gold Unit. If the customs duty payable is one Customs Gold Unit or more, it shall be strictly prohibited.</p>
<h3>Irregular Shipping Cargo: Particularly Active Merchants Consider Revised Freight Rates Too Burdensome</h3>
<p>Merchants Consider Revised Freight Rates Too Burdensome After Shilling Decline</p>
<p>Since the decline of the shilling and the soaring price of coal, the shipping industry has been greatly affected. As a result, freight rates have been repeatedly raised. Several British shipping companies, seeing the rampant decline in foreign exchange, feared that the increased freight rates and ticket prices would not be sufficient to compensate for the losses. Therefore, the freight rate list was converted into Hong Kong dollars based on the national currency and implemented from the first of this month, as previously reported. However, customers must pay the freight in Hong Kong dollars, which they consider too burdensome, so they do not ship much cargo. As a result, the British companies have experienced very little traffic in passengers and cargo to Hong Kong. However, general irregular shipping companies have seized the opportunity to become active, dispatching ships one after another. The freight rates, still collected in national currency, have tripled their profits. Recently, Tung Yih Shipping Company's Tang En ship is scheduled to depart from Shanghai directly to Hong Kong, Singapore, and Penang on the 27th. Lian Shun Shipping Company's San Min ship is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong and Haiphong on the 31st. Warren Shipping Company's Da Pu ship is scheduled to depart directly for Hong Kong on the 29th. Hong Li Pluto ship, managed by Hong Yun Shipping Bureau, is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong and Saigon on the 28th. To avoid congestion and delays in Haiphong, goods being shipped to the mainland are now more conveniently transshipped through Saigon. Quanzhou ship, managed by Qiacheng Shenhang at No. 12 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, departed directly for Hong Kong yesterday morning, fully loaded with passengers and cargo.</p>
<h3>Extortion from Factory Owner: Two Defendants Convicted</h3>
<p>Wanbao Silk Factory at No. 53 Singapore Road was founded by Li Mingzhi from Ningbo and Xu Jianfan from Qingpu (owner of Junfeng Silk Factory). From April to July this year, they continuously received letters signed by the head of the "Iron Blood Eliminate Traitors Group," surnamed Zhang, accusing the factory of profiting by purchasing a large quantity of inferior artificial silk at low prices. The letters demanded 600 yuan, or else drastic measures would be taken to kill Li, etc. Later, Zhang Yongkang from Jiading, who was acquainted with Li and Xu, came to the factory falsely claiming to know the leader of the "Eliminate Traitors Group," surnamed Zhang. Xu Jianfan decided to have Zhang meet the "Eliminate Traitors" at the Xuri Dongsheng Teahouse on North Zhejiang Road, asking Zhang to intercede, for which Zhang took ten yuan for expenses such as talking and transportation, thinking that everything was fine. Unexpectedly, on July 3rd at 11:30 AM, as Li Mingzhi and Xu Jianfan were leaving the factory in a private car, they were ambushed and shot at by bandits on the way, attempting to take Li's life, because the "Eliminate Traitors Group" was determined to get the 600 yuan as a demonstration of their means of harming Li's life. After the incident, Li reported to the Gordon Road Police Station based on information, and Zhang Yongkang was first arrested at the Xuhui Refugee Camp, followed by Mei Renqing from Hubei, both of whom were related to the case. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the trial and sentenced Zhang Yongkang to three years of imprisonment and Mei Renqing to eight months. The remaining charges were dismissed.</p>
<h3>Pawnshops to Restore Old Interest Rates: Two Percent Per Month to Be Implemented Next Month</h3>
<p>The pawnshop industry in the city recently convened a meeting of both new and old businesses at the Pawnshop Association, located in the Jiufu Company building on Parker Road in the Public Concession. Two proposals were discussed. The first proposal was that due to the recent surge in prices and the high cost of living, and the increasing expenses, it was unanimously agreed to restore the old interest rates. From September 1st, all tickets, regardless of size, will be charged a uniform interest rate of two percent per month. All old tickets from before will be exchanged for new tickets to show uniformity. The second proposal was to shorten the term for gold jewelry pledges, considering that in this extraordinary time of national crisis, the market is changing rapidly, and the price of gold jewelry fluctuates too much. If pawnshops pledge according to the current market price, they will inevitably suffer losses in the future. Therefore, some people proposed shortening the term to twelve months. As this matter was deemed to be of great importance, it was decided to retain it and temporarily set the pledge price at 200 yuan per tael. A general meeting will be convened on October 25th this year (i.e., the 13th day of the ninth lunar month, the birthday of Guan Yu) to make a final decision. All businesses were also notified to cancel all existing wall posters and porcelain plaques related to reduced interest rates from today.</p>
<h3>Illegal Exchanges: Chinese Merchants Not Allowed to Participate; Severe Punishment for Those Found to Have Done So; Trading Activities Deemed Invalid</h3>
<p>The various guilds in the city received a telegram yesterday from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs stating that regarding the matter of the Shanghai Far East organizational exchange, the various industries and related firms had previously been ordered by telegram not to participate in this illegal organization. It is now reported that the Japanese side is establishing a Cotton Industry Co., Ltd. Trading Place at the original site of the Shanghai Gold Exchange, stipulating the identity of brokers and requiring a deposit of 3,000 yuan. Transactions are to be in units of ten bales, and the standard brands are designated as the Lanwei brand of the Nichi-Ka Sha Factory and the Shuiyue brand of Nei Wai. It is also stipulated that although the name is cotton industry, it actually includes all kinds of goods, etc. It has been investigated that the establishment of this cotton exchange is intended to monopolize the market and manipulate yarn prices. It is urgent to reiterate the previous order and strictly prohibit Chinese merchants from participating. All industries are hereby ordered to earnestly warn that they must not participate in this illegal organization. Those who participate in the organization of the said exchange, provide money or property, or act as brokers on their own initiative to convey and introduce transactions, once reported and verified, will be punished in accordance with Articles 2, Paragraph 6, and Paragraph 10 of the Punishment Regulations. Furthermore, all trading activities conducted in illegal trading places have been determined by the central government to be invalid and have been ordered to be notified to all courts. Therefore, if Chinese merchants trade in the said exchange, not only will they have no legal protection, but they will also inevitably cause themselves trouble by being exploited. It is also requested that this intention be carefully explained to all merchants, so that they may be vigilant.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Electric Power Company: Questions About Increased Electricity Fees; Soaring Coal Prices and Increasing Expenses; Suspected Additional Fee Increase of 120.01% Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Power Company will add an additional fee of 120.01% at the end of September. According to the company, this increase is due to the sharp decline in foreign exchange in July, which has affected operating expenses. 89% of these expenses must be paid in foreign currency. The company's coal expenses, it is claimed, increased by more than 245% in July this year compared to July 1937, which is three and a half times more than two years ago. The impact of the continued decline in foreign exchange is causing the company to experience even greater expenses than in September. It is reported that the Municipal Council has agreed to increase all fees by 120.01% starting next month.</p>
<h3>Japanese National Trafficking in Opium: Seized by Gordon Road Police Station; Accomplices Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Japanese national Morikawa Matsuo, 40 years old, residing at No. 36 Dalu New Village, Shigaota Road, secretly trafficked in opium in addition to running a construction business. He also owned a black-plated car, No. 10088, and employed Cao Fuzhi from Tongzhou as his driver. Yesterday afternoon at 4:45 PM, Morikawa Matsuo, accompanied by Chen Qiuqing from Haimen and Zhou Xiangshang from Pudong as an interpreter, carried two large packages of opium, weighing 304 taels in total. He ordered his driver Cao Fuzhi to drive to the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Chongqing Road. Suddenly, Inspector Schnakes of the Third Team of the Chengdu Road Police Station, along with Chinese constables No. 2446, No. 1676, and No. 3255, searched the area and seized the opium. The four people, along with the opium and the car, were taken to the police station. Except for the Japanese national and the opium, which were sent to the Japanese Consulate, the other three, Chen, Zhou, and Cao, were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police Lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted according to law. After Judge Chuanda questioned them and clarified the case, he sentenced Chen and the other two to eight months of imprisonment each for aiding others in trafficking opium, and each was deprived of their civil rights for one year.</p>
<h3>Summer Hygiene Exhibition at the Ningbo Residents Association in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Lectures and Entertainment Every Evening</p>
<p>Yiyou Society of this city has always advocated for proper entertainment and service to the community. In view of the increasing prevalence of epidemic diseases in this city, which is a cause for concern, and in order to respond to the Relief Association's fundraising campaign for hygiene expenses for refugees, a summer hygiene campaign was launched. It began yesterday at the auditorium on the second floor of the Ningbo Residents Association in Shanghai, located on Yu Qiaqing Road. In addition to displaying various charts and models related to hygiene for exhibition, various well-known pharmacies, pharmaceutical factories, and chemical industrial societies in this city are participating in selling various practical medical supplies, donating a percentage of the proceeds to refugee expenses.

<h3>Murder Case in Zhaofeng Garden: Four Defendants Confess to Committing the Crime; Awaiting Qin Yuanxing to Appear Before Further Verification</h3>
<p>Qin Yuanxing, a native of Changzhou who worked as a servant for British resident Mr. Wellington at No. 4, a certain apartment in Lane 641, Avenue Joffre, took advantage of his employer's absence on the 16th of this month to bring his fellow villagers Chen Guoyuan (i.e., Chen Xiuquan) and Zhang Xiaoer to the residence. He stole two pistols, over one hundred bullets, and a pistol-shaped lighter from his employer and handed them over to those people, who took them to the Lao Yutai Hotel on Yunnan Road. They were instructed by their accomplice Ren Xiaorong to have Agou accompany them to the Dongfang Hotel to hide the stolen goods in a room. Fearing that Qin Yuanxing would reveal the matter afterward, they ordered Chen and Zhang to lure Qin to Zhaofeng Garden in West Shanghai that evening. At 9:30 PM, Chen and Zhang, along with the brothers Zhou Wenqing and Zhou Xiezhen (also known as Qian Xizhen), who were lying in wait in the garden, first beat Qin into injury and then tightly strangled his neck with a rope. Nearby British soldiers heard the noise and rushed over, capturing Zhou Wenqing and Zhang Xiaoer. Only then was Qin saved from being killed. The other two defendants, Chen Guoyuan and Zhou Xiezhen, were also apprehended by detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station the next day at the Yuanyuan Hotel on Dongxin Bridge, and the stolen guns and bullets were recovered. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. All the details have been reported in the newspapers. Now, Qin Yuanxing, the victim in the case, has recovered from his injuries in the hospital. As the location where he stole the guns and bullets falls under the jurisdiction of the Second Special District Court, he was taken there for investigation by the French police a few days ago. As the defendants Chen Guoyuan and others are also related to the theft of the guns, the Second Special Court prepared an official letter and sent detectives from the French police to attend the First Special Court yesterday morning when Judge Meng Tingke presided over the continued hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court, submitting a letter requesting that the case be transferred for a joint investigation. However, the First Special Court needed the victim Qin Yuanxing to be present for questioning. As Qin was not brought in yesterday, the four defendants were only questioned briefly. According to Zhou Wenqing, Xiezhen is my brother. Chen only invited me and Zhang to go to Zhaofeng Garden that day. We really didn't know about their stealing guns. Later, we were asked to help beat Qin in the garden and did not participate in strangling Qin's neck. Soon after, Zhang and I were arrested by British soldiers. Zhang Xiaoer stated that he was invited by Zhou Wenqing, who said that a woman named Jinbao would be introduced to Qin at the garden that evening. After that, he just followed the crowd in beating Qin and knew nothing else. Chen Guoyuan stated that on the afternoon of the 16th, Qin stole the guns and bullets and handed them over to me to take to Lao Yutai and give to Ren Xiaorong. Ren then gave me two yuan in banknotes and a rope, ordering me to lure Qin to Zhaofeng Garden and take the opportunity to strangle him to death to prevent exposure. Zhou Xiezhen helped pull the rope while the other two just helped beat him. Zhou Xiezhen only admitted to helping beat him, etc. After a statement was made by Police Lawyer Qian Xunjiu, the court ordered all defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing with Qin Yuanxing present.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Jiang Hechun Narrowly Escapes Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, an attempted kidnapping occurred on Racecourse Road. Two cars, Nos. 9832 and 5827, suddenly stopped in front of No. 493 Racecourse Road. Two men in Western-style suits jumped out of the cars and went straight into the building, asking for Jiang Hechun, a resident lawyer. Jiang met with them immediately. Unexpectedly, upon seeing Jiang, the visitors claimed that they had important matters to discuss outside. When Jiang refused, the two men forcibly dragged him out, intending to put him into the car. Jiang, realizing that something was wrong, cried for help. At that moment, a patrolling officer happened to pass by and saw the situation. He immediately drew his gun and approached to arrest them. The two men, who were unarmed, jumped into the car, and both cars sped away one after another. Jiang was then out of danger. Jiang, whose courtesy name is Jianqiu, is from Panyu, Guangdong. He joined the Shanghai Bar Association to practice law in July of the 22nd year.</p>
<h3>Widow Sues for Delivery of Asset Account Books: Lawsuit Withdrawn After Court Persuasion</h3>
<p>Gu Side, a local, is 44 years old. He runs Side Trading Company in a self-built house at No. 93 Muerming Road. The land there covers more than four mu and four fen, along with eight city buildings and one residence built on the ground, all of which are the legacy of his father, Gu Anxiang. The income account books for the real estate have been managed by his nephew, Gu Rongfu. In the winter of the year before last, Gu Rongfu became seriously ill and was replaced by Rongfu's younger brother, Gu Rongxing, as the accountant. Last summer, after Gu Rongfu passed away, his wife, Bai Xiufeng, being a young widow, often argued with them for various reasons. Recently, Bai Xiufeng, along with her son Gu Huasheng (just two years old), filed a complaint in the Civil Court of the First Special District, accusing her uncle Gu Side and her brother-in-law Gu Rongxing, requesting an order to hand over the asset account books and detailed income accounts. Upon receiving the complaint, the court summoned the defendants Gu Side and Gu Rongxing to the Third Civil Court for questioning. The defendants Gu Side and Gu Rongxing appointed lawyer Ma Junshuo to appear in court to defend, stating that the account books were always recorded by the plaintiff's deceased husband, Gu Rongfu. The plaintiff, Bai Xiufeng, had assisted her deceased husband in handling household affairs and should be well aware of any irregularities. As for the second defendant, Gu Rongxing, although he recently succeeded the plaintiff's deceased husband in the position of accountant, the accounts are recorded in a new type of bookkeeping format, which is clear and without any errors. The plaintiff's filing of this lawsuit is suspected to have other purposes. The court examined the statements and, because the case involved family matters, repeatedly and kindly advised the plaintiff. After the plaintiff Bai Xiufeng was patiently persuaded by the court, she withdrew the lawsuit in court, and relatives and friends will mediate the matter to prevent further litigation.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Forces Enter Hengmian</h3>

After a day and night of fierce fighting, Hengmian Town was captured by Xi's unit, and they confronted Xu's unit near Tangmu Bridge.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Public Officials: Extortion and Fraud Case Concluded</h3>
<p>Rogues Lin Kunjin, Yao Wenbin, Ding Shaotong, and Yao Genlin, impersonated detectives from the French police on the night of the 4th of this month. They went to the home of Chen Pu, a Suzhou woman residing at No. 51 Shangxianfang, Avenue Joffre, under the pretext of searching for opium and drugs. They claimed that if she gave them 500 yuan in legal tender, the matter could be resolved, otherwise they would have to take her to the police station for investigation. At the time, Pu, being a woman, did not realize the truth and agreed to give them 200 yuan. However, Lin and others insisted and refused to accept it. While they were negotiating, Pu's brother, Pu Chengyong, discovered that Lin and others were impostors extorting money and secretly reported to the French police. The police immediately dispatched detective Chang Kanghui to rush to the scene and arrest Lin and the others. They were taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special Court for investigation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Liao Yan continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. Attorney Fei Xizhen of the French Concession Administrative Authority presented the case and prosecuted the defendants for impersonating public officials, extortion, and fraud. Ding Shaotong, one of the defendants, hired lawyer Shen Ronghua to defend him. After questioning the four defendants, Lin and others confessed that they met on the road and went to the plaintiff's house together. They were looking for a friend. They admitted that they had impersonated detectives. The court examined the confessions, ordered the opening of arguments, and announced the conclusion of the trial. The verdict will be announced on the morning of the 28th. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Red Pill Criminal Apprehended</h3>
<p>Luo Xiangheng (32 years old) of Guangdong, was found to be carrying forty-eight packages of red pills, weighing twenty-seven pounds, at 12:20 PM yesterday on the road near Robison Road and Jessfield Road. He was apprehended by the Puto Road police search team and taken back to the police station. This morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court, and a public prosecution was initiated against him for the crime of trafficking drugs in violation of Article 4 of the Anti-Drug Law. Judge Huang Risheng presided over the hearing and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody. The verdict is scheduled for next Tuesday. The drugs have been confiscated.</p>
<h3>Rape of Female Teaching Assistant Case</h3>
<p>Appeal with Evasive Words</p>
<p>Xie Xiangheng, a native of Wujin who once served as a teacher at the La Genna Elementary School, used the pretext of recruiting a female teaching assistant in the spring of the year before last to deceive Wang Jie, a young woman from Pinghu, to his residence at No. 14 Jiyili, Bubian Road, which was Xie's residence. He promised Wang Jie a monthly salary of 15 yuan, asking Wang Jie to modify student papers there. Unexpectedly, around 4:00 PM on May 16 of the same year, Xie closed the door tightly and committed indecency. Later, Wang Jie's mother, Wu, discovered that her daughter, who was only eighteen years old, had been violated and was heartbroken. She hired lawyer Qian Yuan to file a complaint in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Xie of committing a crime against public morals. The initial trial in the case acquitted Xie. Wang Wu did not accept the verdict and hired lawyer Qian to appeal to the High Third Branch Court. During the appeal period, Xie committed another fraud case and was sentenced to one year of imprisonment by the First Special Court. Regarding the case of the rape of female teaching assistant Wang Jie, the High Third Branch Court sentenced him to six months of imprisonment after interrogation. Xie did not accept the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court. Recently, the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court ruled to overturn the original verdict. Yesterday, Wu Tingqi, a judge of the Criminal Court of the High Third Branch Court, along with judges Wang and Chen, opened a joint court for trial. Xie's statement was evasive, claiming that Wang Jie first slept naked on his bed, leading to consensual sexual intercourse. Lawyer Qian then detailed Xie's reasons for appeal, stating that they were quibbles and requesting that Xie be punished for the crime he deserved. The court examined the statements and announced that the trial was concluded and that the verdict would be announced later.</p>
<h3>Woman Loses Watch: Russian Barber Suspected and Arrested</h3>
<p>Cao Jindi, a woman from Yangzhou residing in a flat in Qianjiatang Kailingli, Huanlong Road, is twenty years old. She stayed with a Westerner in Room 2, Apartment 8, Laffayette New Village, Lafayette Road on the night of the 21st. When she got up at 8:00 AM the next morning and went to the bathroom to wash, she took off a gold watch worth 37 yuan and left it in the bathroom. A Russian barber named Dasi (transliteration) came to urge her. Cao went out of the bathroom in a hurry, forgetting the watch. When she remembered and went back to the bathroom to look for it, it was gone. She suspected that the barber had stolen it. She told the Westerner she was staying with, who reported it to the French police. Dasi was arrested and sent to the Second Special Court. Yesterday, Judge Wu Kechou questioned him in the Eighth Criminal Court. The police requested an adjournment for further investigation and questioning. The court questioned Dasi and approved the investigation, rescheduling the trial. The defendant was taken into custody.</p>

He is unmarried and has an affair with Chen Qian, the wife of Chen Tinghua (29 years old), a native of Chongming, who lives at No. 59 Changyuli, Yangjia Lane, Julai Road. Around 7:00 PM on June 21st this year, Wang went to Chen's house after his shift to continue their affair. Chen Tinghua returned home from outside and caught them in the act of adultery. He grabbed Wang, intending to send him to the police station for investigation. While they were struggling, Wang grabbed a sharp knife from the table, intending to scare the husband into releasing him. Unexpectedly, Qian stepped forward to dissuade him, and Wang's knife accidentally stabbed Qian in both legs. Her husband's fingers were also slightly injured. Neighbors living nearby called the police, and Wang and the husband were arrested and taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. At the same time, Qian was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Chen Tinghua, the husband, felt resentful for being detained in the position of plaintiff and victim, and filed a petition with the court requesting bail. The request was approved. The case was brought to trial in the First Criminal Court in front of Judge Sun Penghua on the morning of the day before yesterday. The police lawyer requested that the hearing be adjourned again, as Chen Qianmin was still being treated in the hospital for her injuries and had not yet recovered. The court examined the report and approved the adjournment, pending Chen Qian's recovery. Wang remained in custody, and Chen Tinghua remained on the original bail.</p>
<h3>Furnace Explosion Injures People</h3>

The thief confessed his name as Zhang Jin and revealed the addresses of his accomplices, Xu Ziqing and Liang Dingji. Subsequently, detectives dispatched by the police station arrested Xu and Liang at Hongqiao Road, recovering the stolen money, goods, and photograph.</p>
<h3>Landlords in Liyuanfang, Near the Chinese Concession, Intend to Raise Rents</h3>
<p>Tenants of Liyuanfang on Route Paul Henry Brunel have recently faced demands from the China Business Corporation, the landlord, to increase rents by over 40% per house starting this July. The tenants strongly oppose this, arguing that during these extraordinary times, with Shanghai resembling an isolated island, the people are suffering immensely. Landlords should show compassion for the difficult times. Moreover, the location is adjacent to the Chinese Concession, and since the "August 13th" incident, traffic has been cut off, effectively isolating the area. Not only are the shops along the street unable to operate due to closed frontages, losing their original function, but also the tenants' access is limited to Kangding Road's Rongjin narrow lane, causing great inconvenience. The corporation's decision to raise rents without consideration is considered baseless. Yesterday, the tenants held a meeting and unanimously resolved to reject the illegal rent increase and have commissioned lawyers Chao Kun, Shan Yuhua, and Zhao Yuxiang to handle the matter legally.</p>
<h3>Suicide Attempts</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 12:30 AM, a man named Dong Ahua, 22 years old, jumped into the Huangpu River at Wharf No. 6 on the Bund due to economic hardship and poverty, intending to end his life. He was rescued and taken by ambulance to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>A young man named Hu Shinan, 24 years old, residing at 3827 Rue Robert, Shanghai West, suddenly conceived the idea of death. He ingested poison around 1:00 AM yesterday morning and was subsequently taken to the Labor Hospital for treatment by ambulance.</p>
<p>Jiang Junxin, 19 years old, a guest in room 218 of the Yangtze Hotel on Hankou Road, suddenly had thoughts of ending his life. Yesterday at noon, he secretly ingested a large amount of corrosive sublimate (mercuric chloride) to commit suicide. The room attendant discovered him and quickly sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment by car.</p>
<h3>Bund Park Brass Band Concert</h3>

<h3>Wartime Educational Facilities in Henan (Continued)</h3>
<p>Guerrilla Education</p>
<p>The measures for promoting education in the guerrilla zones of the province include: (1) Restoring educational administrative organs, retaining the original organization of the education bureau, and not leaving the county boundaries; (2) Preparing for the establishment of joint district middle schools. If the original middle schools in each guerrilla zone cannot be opened, the education bureau will investigate the number of students and teachers, report to the county government, and forward the information to the provincial government for the establishment of joint schools. If funding is insufficient, a request for subsidies will be submitted to the provincial government; (3) Elementary schools, short-term schools, and people's schools should move with the population, ensuring that education is available wherever the people go, with teaching methods including open-air teaching or itinerant teaching; (4) Secret anti-Japanese war education under the puppet organization: changing the form of schools and establishing private schools to secretly promote anti-Japanese war education.</p>
<p>Special Education</p>
<p>Special education takes Zhongshan School as its center, implementing management, education, upbringing, and hygiene to correct the thinking of the people in the bandit areas and teach them self-sufficiency and production skills. The province's implementation process includes: (1) Establishing the Henan Province Special Education Office in the 13th year of the Republic; (2) Funds are allocated by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund to subsidize the province, starting with 20,000 yuan from the second half of the 26th year, with the provincial treasury contributing 30% and the central government 70% (reduced to 70% after the "July 7th Incident," and then reduced to 50% after the provincial treasury's 70% in the second half of the 27th year); (3) Operations: 52 Zhongshan People's Schools, 68 classes for children, 20 classes for adults, 12 classes for women, and 7,418 male and female students; (4) Anti-Japanese War Work: Although counties such as Huangchuan were once occupied, special education personnel remained in the guerrilla areas to undertake political work, change the form of schools, secretly implement anti-Japanese war education, or serve as communication personnel. The Ministry of Education has reportedly issued a commendation and a bonus of 1,000 yuan, which will be awarded to the best performers.</p>
<p>Future Plans</p>
<p>The province, mindful of the fact that schools in various war zones have hastily moved out of the province, resulting in students being scattered and young people in the war zones losing their schooling and intellectuals losing their jobs, deems this inappropriate. It has decided that, no matter what happens, it will not move out of the province. If necessary, it will move the schools into a mountain to implement anti-Japanese war education in order to continue cultural life and cultivate talents for the anti-Japanese war and national reconstruction. It is currently constructing a joint school building capable of accommodating thousands of people in a certain township, which was completed in May. It is also building several joint school buildings in the mountains of Song County and Lushi County in preparation for emergencies.</p>

<h3>Part of the Staff of the Shanghai East Commune Will Move Back to Yangshupu</h3>
<p>The Shanghai East Commune of the University of Shanghai, originally located in Yangshupu, was praised by the community for improving workers' knowledge, popularizing labor education, and promoting healthy entertainment. Due to the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the commune moved to Fuzhou Road in the central district of the concession because the area was a key point in the war. Since the commune moved from an industrial area to a commercial center, its work shifted to matters such as apprentice schools. Recently, it has been heard that the commune, in view of the rapid increase in the population of the Hongkou and Yangshupu districts and the gathering of workers, plans to move some of its staff back to the original site to resume work in accordance with its past mission of serving the community.</p>

Jia Youliang and Wan Xianghua are also practicing diligently.</p>

<h3>Finance: Seven Nations Call for Peace; Gold Prices Surge Again; Highest Reached 4,200 Yuan; Trading Busy, Around 2,000 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market was erratic due to fluctuating sentiment, with prices fluctuating wildly. Generally, it first fell and then soared. Opening was influenced by the afterglow of last night's closing, and due to a certain gold shop's appetite, it was raised to 4,040 yuan. However, due to the easing of foreign exchange rates, sales from A and B gold shops were strong, and the price once dropped to a low of 3,900 yuan. Later, as foreign exchange rates stabilized, buying sentiment was stimulated. A certain gold shop strongly absorbed orders from speculators, and Hong Kong traders also came to buy, so the price rebounded sharply, soaring to 4,095 yuan. At noon, it retreated slightly, and the noon closing was 4,065 yuan. In the early afternoon, as A and B gold shops rushed to sell, it was pushed back into the 4,000 yuan mark, reaching 3,970 yuan. Later, news of the seven nations calling for peace emerged, and foreign exchange rates tightened. People's sentiment turned optimistic, and foreign and Tianjin-Hong Kong traders and speculators entrusted brokers in the market to buy aggressively. With few sellers, it soared again to a high of 4,200 yuan. However, it closed at 4,170 yuan, up 205 yuan from the previous day. Trading was brisk, reaching about 20,000 taels. Jewelry gold also fluctuated accordingly, eventually rising by 20 yuan. The prices of customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rises 205 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially opened with little change compared to the previous evening's closing, despite the slight easing of foreign exchange rates in the morning, due to a certain gold shop's appetite. However, it was 75 yuan higher than the previous day's evening closing price. A certain gold shop bought 20 taels from gold shops at 4,040 yuan. After opening, the retail shops of various gold shops received a lot of goods, resulting in frequent hedging sales. The trend turned downward due to persistently strong foreign exchange rates. It soon fell by 140 yuan. A money exchange shop sold 10 taels to a certain gold shop for 3,900 yuan. After 10:30 AM, it was heard that foreign exchange rates gradually stabilized, and buying sentiment strengthened. A certain gold shop and Hong Kong traders competed to absorb, and a certain money exchange shop also had a strong appetite, so it rebounded directly, soaring by 195 yuan. The gold shop bought 20 taels from gold shops for 4,095 yuan. By this time, it was already noon. Later, a money exchange shop sold out to take profits, and it immediately fell back 30 yuan. A money exchange shop sold 20 taels to the gold shop for 4,065 yuan, making the noon closing price. After closing, the price was raised to 4,120 yuan as a certain gold shop came to dig for more. In the afternoon, the market rebounded again due to a rush to sell from the gold shops and tracking sales from retail investors. Opening was 35 yuan lower than the noon closing. The gold shops sold 20 taels to the money exchange shop for 4,030 yuan. After opening, buying sentiment was still strong, and it soon returned within 40 yuan. The money exchange shop sold 10 taels to the gold shop for 3,970 yuan. After that, a certain gold shop started a buying spree again, and foreign exchange rates tightened, so a certain gold shop (acting on behalf of non-industry players), securities firms, and a certain gold shop acting on behalf of customers competed to absorb, causing the market price to immediately rebound sharply. Under the cover of a buying spree, it jumped 230 yuan. The money exchange shop bought 30 taels from the gold shop for 4,200 yuan. Later, the gold shops sold 20 taels to the gold shop for 4,170 yuan, making the evening closing price. As a result, it rebounded 205 yuan from the previous day. It was heard that Hong Kong traders still had an appetite after closing, and the price was raised to 4,190 yuan. The daily fluctuation was 300 yuan. The gold price quoted by the current gold shops is 10 yuan higher than the spot gold price. The current bid gold price is 65 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Rises 20 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial quotation for jewelry gold was 400 yuan per tael, and Daxon hung it. At 9:25 AM, it increased by 5 yuan, and after 25 minutes, it decreased by small 5 yuan, at 11:30 AM, it increased by large 5 yuan again. After 10 minutes, it increased by 5 yuan again, at 2:35 PM, it increased by large 5 yuan again. At 3:00 PM, it increased by 5 yuan again. As a result, it increased by 20 yuan. It is estimated that Daxon revised to 420 yuan, and New Row was 418 yuan. Taking in decreased by 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Sino-British Pure Gold Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>London, 20th: British pure gold has not changed, and is still 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 6 and a half pence per ounce, so the market prices of the central banks have also remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Speculative Intentions Shift: Sell British Gold, Buy US Dollars</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: The HSBC listing price was revealed, with no changes. The British-US exchange rate in the unofficial market fluctuated due to the uncertain situation and unpredictable sentiment. Therefore, it initially loosened and then suddenly tightened. The morning opening was slightly soft. The market was pressured because Hong Kong continued to heavily sell and Chinese merchants boldly sold large amounts of British gold. However, the Bank of England and HSBC absorbed these sales, and British firm Sassoon also participated in the buying. This eased the loosening trend, although British gold once strengthened to 3 pence 8125, and the US dollar also weakened to 7.4375. Subsequently, Sassoon resumed buying and Chinese merchants strongly bought US dollars for September delivery, gradually stabilizing the situation. By the afternoon close, it was on par with the morning opening. In the afternoon, news circulated in the market that the seven-nation alliance was mediating for peace. Therefore, it was generally believed that there might be a glimmer of hope for the European situation. As a result, Chinese merchants continued to purchase spot US dollars, and HSBC's appetite for British gold remained strong. Therefore, the market sentiment turned tight and soft. Ultimately, British gold closed at 3 pence 59375 and the US dollar closed at 7 yuan. The trend for this month's futures was similar to the spot market. Due to sudden changes in the global situation, warring countries naturally face risks. The market generally adopted a bearish position of selling British pounds and buying US dollars for September delivery. As a result, the US dollar was tighter than the British pound.</p>
<p>Sassoon and Chinese Merchants Shift from Selling to Buying</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London rate narrowed by 375, the New York silver price fell slightly, the London gold price remained unchanged, the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar was stable, against Shanghai it rose by 1875, against France it fell slightly. The US dollar against the British pound remained level, against Shanghai it rose by 4 jiao 1 fen, and against France it rose by 0.0625. The central listing prices for various currencies remained the same. The bank's morning opening selling prices for spot were British gold at 3 pence 71875 and the US dollar at 7.25 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the British pound weakened by 0.03125 and the US dollar strengthened by 0.0625. After the opening, Hong Kong Electric and speculators continued to aggressively sell, causing British gold to surge. However, HSBC's absorption was good, and Sassoon also bought spot shillings. Therefore, the loosening trend was relatively slow. It is estimated that Sassoon absorbed 3 pence 71875 of spot British gold from foreign banks. Subsequently, Hong Kong Electric and Chinese merchants successively sold spot British gold at 3 pence 75 and 8125 to HSBC and other favorable British banks. They then sold spot US dollars at 7.3125 and 4375 to American banks. When the HSBC listing prices were revealed, there were no fluctuations, and the silver balance tax remained exempt. Afterwards, Western merchant Sassoon and foreign firms bought spot British gold at 3 pence 75 from foreign banks and Chinese banks, and also bought spot US dollars at 7.375 from foreign banks. Therefore, the process gradually stabilized. Later, general Chinese merchants vigorously bought September US dollars at 6.75 and 625 from Hong Kong Electric and foreign banks. Therefore, the futures market sentiment tightened. By the afternoon close, the bank's spot selling prices were British gold at 3 pence 71875 and US dollar at 7.25 yuan, which were the same as the opening prices.</p>
<p>September Futures: US Dollar Tighter Than British Pound</p>
<p>Later in the market, Western merchant Sassoon resumed absorbing spot shillings, and Chinese merchants vigorously bought spot wine, causing the trend to soften. First, Sassoon absorbed spot British gold at 3 pence 65625 and 625 from foreign banks. Then, Chinese merchants bought spot US dollars at 7.15625 and 125 from a certain bank. At that time, Chinese merchants also bought September US dollars at 6.4375 and 375 from foreign banks. After entering, Chinese merchants bought spot US dollars at 7 yuan from a certain bank. By the evening close, the bank's spot selling prices were British gold at 3 pence 59375 and the US dollar at 7 yuan. The prices for British gold for this month were 3 pence 578125 and the US dollar was 6.96875. The prices for British gold for September were 3 pence 3125 and the US dollar was 6.3125. As a result, compared to the previous day, spot and this month's British pound tightened by 0.09375, and the US dollar softened by 0.1875. September's British pound was 0.0125 more expensive, and the US dollar narrowed by 0.0375.</p>

<h3>Foreign Currency Rebounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currencies rebounded sharply as the foreign exchange market tightened in the afternoon. British and American gold pounds were firm and rose. Customers took the opportunity to buy British and American gold notes at low prices, which also became more expensive. Hong Kong notes initially loosened and then tightened, resulting in a slight increase. French franc notes were scarce in supply and demand and remained stable. Singapore notes were weak and fell slightly. Dutch notes were in demand and rose slightly. Canadian and Philippine notes followed the rise of strong American notes. German gold notes were not in high demand and fell significantly due to the European situation. Australian gold notes followed the rise of British notes. Japanese gold notes also rebounded, with the evening market at 1.16 yuan. Korean notes rose slightly, with the evening market at 0.995 yuan.

<h3>US Silver Recovers Slightly, British and Indian Silver Follow Suit</h3>

New York Silver Telegram: American spot silver recovered slightly by 0.005. Bombay Silver Telegram: The Indian silver market was weak. Spot fell by 6 annas, and futures fell by 7 annas. Only 25 contracts were traded.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Market Uncertain, Bulls Continuously Emerging, Market Price Gains Thwarted</h3>
<p>In the unofficial securities market, the rising momentum from yesterday still had some residual power. However, due to the continuous emergence of bulls and the rise of uncertainty in sentiment, market prices were also slightly thwarted. Since Germany and the Soviet Union became friends after being enemies, there were still unpredictable changes in the future. The bond market naturally had considerable indirect stakes in this. This became the focus of discussion for both bulls and bears, with many conflicting opinions and difficulty reaching a logical conclusion. Therefore, most people still followed the market sentiment and took profits when available without long-term thinking. In this volatile market, it was not easy to return to the right track. Yesterday's trading volume decreased significantly. The trend initially went from low to high, then peaked and weakened. Neither buyers nor sellers showed continued excitement. Buyers only included No. 14 and No. 15, and Da Feng had a slight appetite for buying. No. 41 was still selling, and Lianhe and Tongkang also sold off. As a result, market prices still rose by 46 jiao. After the close, the foreign exchange market tightened again, and gold prices rose again. The bond market then fell by 34 jiao. The total transaction volume was 1 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Market Conditions: The share price of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange was 36 yuan, and 100 shares were traded.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reported that stock market trading was scarce, and price fluctuations were small. Although the afternoon was the time for new trading to begin next week, interest was still lacking. Traders, in view of the European situation, seemed to have no intention of participating in new trades.</p>
<p>London British Merchant Far East Company Stocks: The listed prices for this month's 23rd (Wednesday) were slightly stable. HSBC Bank's British-registered shares rose by 1 pound to 66 pounds, while Hong Kong-registered shares fell by 0.5 pounds to 68 pounds. It was still a market with prices but no transactions. Gulang Rubber shares rose by 1 shilling 3 pence to 17 shillings 6 pence, and the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Debt: The listed prices for this month's 23rd (Wednesday) were slightly soft. The Reorganization British issue fell by 1 pound to 26 pounds, and the Jinpu Original British issue fell by 0.5 pounds to 11.5 pounds. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway bond telegram said it fell to 8.5 pounds, a drop of 4.5 pounds. It was feared that this was a coding error and would need to be verified later. All other varieties remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn: Panic Selling by Hoarders, Yarn Prices Plummet - Double Horse Writes Another 50 Yuan Down</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been falling on Saturday and Sunday, continued to decline today, and the falling momentum continued. The environment was bad, and foreign exchange rates rose. Hoarders who had disregarded everything in the past now saw the European war clouds looming and a war about to break out. As a result, sentiment was uncertain, and there were many small-scale floating sales. In this situation, they reluctantly sold their positions, and the supply of chips became excessive. Yarn prices plummeted. The 20-count Double Horse foreign warehouse goods broke through the 700 yuan mark, and warehouse list prices fell below the 600 yuan mark. The spot Double Horse price was 650 yuan, a further drop of 50 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The opening price of spot yarn in the morning continued the residual momentum from the previous day. The warehouse list price of 20-count Double Horse yarn continued to fall by 21 yuan to 585 yuan. However, there were few inquiries for spot goods. After a short while, some people felt that the degree of decline was too deep, and a buying wave suddenly rose, rising by 15 yuan in less than a moment, breaking through the 600 yuan mark, and the price reached 610 yuan. Then, news came that foreign exchange rates were rising, and at the same time, bad news followed. The situation changed abruptly, and sellers swarmed in, their shouts shaking the outdoors. In an instant, it fell sharply by 450 yuan. The warehouse price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 574 yuan, and the spot price was 650 yuan. The closing price was flat. It was found that the transaction volume in half a day totaled 950 bales. The market price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 50 yuan, Double Globe fell by 30 yuan, Heavenly Maiden fell by 40 yuan, and Shepherd Boy fell by 24 yuan. It was found that 30 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin today, 50 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 80 pieces were shipped to Haiphong. The amounts bought by each trade group are listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Plunge, Cotton Sales Stall</h3>
<p>There was no transaction in the Chinese and foreign spot cotton trade. However, sentiment was slightly different. The factories, in view of the tragic fall in cotton yarn prices and the fierce falling momentum, had scattered sentiment for purchasing raw materials. As for the cotton merchants, although foreign exchange rates rose, the converted price was not much cheaper, and the stock of cotton was decreasing day by day. Therefore, they did not loosen their intention to sell. In this situation, the two sides presented a stalemate. According to a certain broker, 100 pieces of Tongye Zhongjin Huisi were sold for 140 yuan, which was 3 yuan lower than the previous day's price. Only 50 bales of Tonghua from Subei arrived. The opening price for each side on the previous day was recorded as a rise of 10 yuan in error and is now corrected.</p>
<p>In addition, Shanghai's foreign cotton trading saw that the exchange rate had turned into a firm state yesterday. However, yarn prices were tragically falling due to the panic of domestic merchants, who were aggressively selling. As a result, cotton prices were falling. The original cotton price was weak to sell because the sentiment of the industry was quite firm, and it was temporarily not planned to sell. As a result, trading was more quiet.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: In the New York cotton market, it was still firm in the early morning. Later, due to the critical European situation, New York securities plummeted, and sentiment was volatile. Most of the bulls took profits and closed their positions, and the market price fell as a result. At the close, it fell by more than 10 pounds compared to the previous day. Indian prices, including forecasts, fell by 2 rupees. Egyptian prices rose by 45 pounds.</p>
<h3>Regularly Scheduled Deliveries: European Situation Urgent, Hoarders Sell Off, Customers Wait and See, Sales Plunge - Domestic Cloth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the urgent European situation and volatile sentiment, hoarders tended to sell off, and merchants in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and other markets also depreciated and resold their goods. Buyers were fearful, and transactions declined sharply. The market price fell sharply, and the difference between the marked price and the unofficial price reached 0.5 yuan. Wholesale shops on this street sold 2,800 pieces of dyed cloth, dyed twill, printed cloth, flannel, and velvet to retail shops and various ports in the Yangtze River Delta and middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Most customers from the Chu trade group adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and small purchases continued. Market prices for fine cloth and fine twill continued to fall by 0.2 to 0.5 yuan per piece, coarse cloth fell by 0.1 to 0.5 yuan, and dyed cloth, line flannel, and baize fell by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan per piece. Printed goods were stable.</p>
<p>Dong Ding</p>
<p>The selling atmosphere was still strong in the morning market, and the market price fell sharply again. The lowest price for Longtou fine cloth fell to 17.2 yuan, and the price for Wufu fine cloth fell to 15.5 yuan. Merchants from Tianjin and dyed cloth shops were selling. However, since this price for Longtou was already 2.8 yuan different from the previous week's September futures market price, there was a move to buy at a low price. Sales rose again, and the resulting Longtou price was 17.78 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 6700 bales of fine cloth and fine twill. Baize and zhigong also continued to fall by 0.124 yuan per piece.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>Today, there were five scheduled deliveries shipped to Hong Kong, 210 pieces shipped to Haiphong, 12 pieces shipped to Yantai, and 20 pieces shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Food: Prevent Accidents, Rice Shops Reduce Purchases, Customer Xian Rice Falls by 0.3-0.5 Yuan, Fresh Jing Rice Still Opens at 40 Yuan</h3>
<p>Du Rice: Recently, rice prices have been soaring, with general rice shops selling at high prices of 423 yuan, causing the poor to be unable to make a living and triggering rice riots. There were two or three incidents every day. Yesterday, a rice warehouse on Tongfu Road almost suffered a robbery. Fortunately, the police arrived after hearing the news, and it did not happen. Therefore, the shop owners were all vigilant and rarely made purchases. Also, yesterday, a total of 14 boats of rice from Hexia, Songjiang, and Nangang arrived from all routes, 1,450 bales of Fengjing Che Lun Baozi, 2,000 bales of new Jian rice from Jiaxing, Jiashan, Kunshan, and other places. In addition, Wuhu new Jian rice also arrived. However, the number of old Jian rice was limited, and sentiment was slightly calmer. It was estimated that fresh Xijing was priced at 40 yuan, high Xijing was priced at 39 yuan, Changzhou fresh Xijing was priced at 39.5 yuan, Su Tongkun Jing was priced at 38.5-38 yuan, Songjiang and Nangang Songyin early and late rice from Hexia were priced at 356 yuan, original bales were priced at 38 yuan, Jiashan Jiaxing new Jian was priced at 34 yuan, Kunshan Xinchuan Jian was priced at 34.5 yuan, Wuhu new early Jian was priced at 34 yuan, high Chen Wujian was priced at 3635 yuan, Wuxi Bianwu was priced at 31 yuan, and Danyang Bianyuan was priced at 30 yuan. The total number of transactions was more than 8,000 bales.</p>
<p>Customer Xian: Yesterday, the buying sentiment turned weak, and the total transaction volume was only more than 2,000 bales. The industry hoarders had no new appetite, and the shops were also preventing accidents and did not dare to buy much. Also, new Xian rice from all routes continued to arrive on the market. In the future, new rice can still come to Shanghai in a steady stream. Some of the previously arrived Wu Xian rice had already been transferred out. Therefore, the price had fallen by 0.3-0.5 yuan. High Wu Xian was priced at 35.5-34 yuan, and the price for Zhongjue was not uniform.</p>
<p>Yang Rice: Transactions were quiet. However, it was heard that various groups, commercial firms, and factories were all trying to order on their own. Only 200 bales of Chen Xiaojiao were opened at a price of 34 yuan, and the new Saigon was not opened.</p>
<h3>Flour: Rising Momentum Gradually Weakens, Wheat Prices Also Loosen</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, although the price of the No. 2 flour mill stood at the original price of 6.4 yuan, the recovered goods gradually loosened. Due to the tense European situation and the plummeting gold price the day before, commodity prices showed a slight downward trend. Therefore, general customers and hoarders were not eager to buy. It was heard that the recovered goods had loosened to 6.56 yuan. The sales in this street were active. Amid the high rice prices, the demand from various shop doors was still strong, with more than 30,000 bales sold. Transactions with customers were still sluggish. According to customer news, the current price of Tianjin flour is limited, and transportation is also difficult to calculate. It is necessary to wait for the market price to fall before there is a formal sale. It was found that 1,000 bales of flour were shipped to Tanggu today.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the wheat market also appeared loose. Since the international situation changed, the industry hoarders first waited and watched, and the mills' appetite also turned loose at the same time. Also, the wheat price had reached a high peak of 10 yuan, and the rising momentum had reached its full potential. Therefore, the buyers took advantage of this to suppress the price and take it. Yesterday, the Fufu and Liang factories bought a total of 10,000 bales of wheat from Wuxi, Suzhou, Danyang, Changzhou, Puzhen, Caishi, Wuhu, and Pudong. Domestic households entered two carts of Daqiao wheat, and the price was similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Loosens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to move downstream as foreign exchange rates loosened. According to foreign telegrams, there was a slight recovery.

<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Sales Lively, Silk Merchants Break Free From European Turmoil, White Factory Down 400 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local silk market in Shanghai suddenly turned lively for foreign sales. However, the silk market fell relatively as foreign exchange rates rose. White Factory 78 points opened at 3,800 yuan, a sharp drop of 400 yuan compared to the beginning of the week. Li Li 6 numbers opened at 1,800 yuan, a drop of 200 yuan. However, transactions were brisk. In general, silk merchants sold their goods in a rush due to the European situation and the impending outbreak of war. Yesterday, Xinfu Dachang and other firms entered nearly 300 dans of White Factory Li Li.</p>
<p>Foreign Silk Market: New York spot prices for Chinese and Japanese raw silk fell by 2 cents each. Lyon fell by 0.5-1 French franc. New York near-term prices rose by 1 cent, and far-term prices remained unchanged. Yokohama spot prices rose by 10 yuan, and far-term prices rose by 2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: White Coal Sales Strong, Prices Stable</h3>
<p>Due to the tense European situation, the shilling had risen the day before, and foreign exchange rates had loosened. The fish in the department store had suddenly plunged, but the coal market remained stable due to strong real sales. The selling price was not weak. The industry discount price for Hongji White Coal was still 96 yuan, Haifeng Coal was 94 yuan per ton, and Mark Coal was 93 yuan. The shipment from the concession warehouse was traded in cash by the industry.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Qing Lead and Tin Sales Stagnant</h3>
<p>Recently, hardware transactions have been very quiet, and prices are also chaotic. Therefore, the market situation is deserted. It was found that the Tianjin gang and Qingdao, Yantai, and other gangs had no appetite for Qing lead and tin. Factories and hoarders on Muji Street were also stagnant, so transactions were sporadic. However, the selling prices were still high due to industry relationships. For example, the price of Citibank Qing lead was 90 yuan, the price of Dutch tin was 880 yuan, the price of Xiaokeng tin was 830 yuan, and the price of Jinguang tin was 300 yuan. The unit was dan. It was found that the standard was 1020 yuan better than before.</p>

<h3>Raw Peanuts Gradually Rise</h3>
<p>Raw peanuts have been in short supply recently, and market prices have gradually increased. Yesterday, the price in the ocean market was opened to 31.5 yuan per dan, and the Southern Regulation Bank sold at 35 yuan, which was only enough to cover costs. It was truly an extraordinary price in an extraordinary time.</p>
<h3>Candied Dates Fall</h3>
<p>Recently, candied dates have arrived from Jiaxing and Suzhou. Also, the appetite in Hong Kong has gradually been satisfied, and there is no intention to continue ordering. Therefore, the market situation suddenly turned weak, and selling prices fell by 1020 yuan. The bank price was 110-105 yuan per piece. According to news from Lanxi, the production price was relatively cheap, and a small number of transfers to the local market would arrive soon.</p>

<h3>Current Affairs Sketch: Rice Robbers</h3>
<p>— Liu Xinghuo</p>
<p>This is a corner of the isolated island. It is in a humble alley. It is in a dilapidated room. The dim kerosene lamp light is as terrible as the face of the child sleeping on the bed board. The mother crouching next to him has shown exhaustion for all kinds of coaxing the child, and the gossamer-like breathing is still continuing to flow.</p>
<p>"Mom...! Mom... I'm hungry..."</p>
<p>"...Don't yell... Father... Father's coming! To cook..."</p>
<p>When the weak voice was about to be swallowed by loneliness, suddenly, a man rushed in from the outside like he was crazy. He gasped and shouted: "It's not me! It's not me!" and staggered to the table. In the light of the kerosene lamp, you could see his pale face.</p>
<p>"Father!...The child is crying."</p>
<p>The woman jumped up from the edge of the bed in surprise: "You...why?...</p>
<p>You...go outside and see if there are any police..."</p>
<p>The woman looked out the door, and there wasn't a ghost in the quiet alley. She began to tremble: "There's nothing! You...what trouble did you cause?"</p>
<p>"No, no." The man's gasping gradually calmed down.</p>
<p>"Your rice...didn't you buy rice?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Don't talk about it." He seemed to be alarmed when he heard the word rice. "Rice, yes, I didn't buy it. No! No! I didn't buy...When I ran to the rice shop, it was crowded with a large group of people. They were noisy, as if they were making noise, so I squeezed forward. I don't know who shouted a robbery, and everyone rushed in. I was also squeezed into the store in the crowd. They all carried the rice and flour piled there like tigers and left. I thought of you, I thought of my child, who hasn't eaten anything today; so I picked up a bag of rice from the ground..."</p>
<p>"What? You also robbed rice...No! No! You must be wrong!" She said with great nervousness: "Where is your rice?..."</p>
<p>"I picked up a bag of rice, and suddenly, a burst of distress welled up from my chest. Why should I rob rice? Is it all the rice shop's fault that rice prices keep rising? Is robbing rice a permanent solution? Who is causing such a chaotic situation in Shanghai? ...While I was thinking wildly, I heard someone shout: "The police are coming!" I hurriedly ran away, and I don't know where the rice on my shoulder went..."</p>
<p>"So, no rice..." She was a little dejected. "But, we can still bear hunger, but the child can't stand it! My poor child..." She looked at the child with concern, and the child had fallen asleep out of exhaustion.</p>
<p>"Yes, if we go on like this, we may starve to death one day." His face was intertwined with distress, annoyance, and anger. But, after a while, his eyes lit up, as if they were burning with fire: "No! I never want to starve to death alive here. If I'm going to die, I have to find a valuable way to die."</p>
<p>The kerosene ran dry, and darkness came after the lamp light shook. Let the bright moonlight illuminate this silent room and ignite the anger in the young man's chest!</p>
<h3>Rain After Clearing</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Episode Fifteen: Overseas Love News Suddenly Welcomes Peach Leaf; A Miraculous Scene Amidst the Fire, Truly Outstanding Lotus</p>
<p>Alice also, as her aunt had said, inevitably exaggerated things somewhat. However, these words cannot be said to be completely without influence. Although this aunt was conservative and stubborn, her advice against marrying a Chinese man stemmed from her sincerity. Besides her aunt, others might not approve either, and Alice herself was still hesitant. Unexpectedly, as the Chinese say, "Marriage is predestined by heaven." Marriage truly has what is called a heavenly connection. If there is a real connection, it cannot be broken no matter what. Perhaps Alice and Chenggong were destined for each other, with a guiding hand in the dark, teaching a white woman to marry a yellow-skinned husband. One day, an accident suddenly occurred at Alice's home. It turns out that Westerners often like to live in tall buildings, especially in cities. The most numerous and tallest buildings are in New York, USA, where some buildings have over a hundred stories. New Yorkers have a competitive spirit when it comes to building tall buildings, and once this competitive spirit takes hold, it's unstoppable. For example, if you build a hundred-story building, tomorrow someone else will build a hundred-and-five-story building, surpassing your record by five stories. The next day, someone else, not to be outdone, insists on building a hundred-and-ten-story building, breaking your hundred-and-five-story record. If the city authorities don't impose a limit, the height will keep increasing indefinitely. Now, in France, where we are, there are no such extremely tall buildings, but five or six-story buildings are not uncommon. Alice lived in a five-story building, an apartment-style building that they called an "apartment." Alice's family had a very luxurious house, but it was in the countryside, far from the city. However, because Alice wanted to study at the University of Lyon, she rented this apartment, which was not far from the school. Fortunately, there were only her mother and daughter, so they didn't need a very large house, and this apartment was quite elegantly decorated and fully equipped. Downstairs, there were also gardens, lawns, tennis courts, and the like. Of course, Alice's male and female classmates had all been there, and Chenggong had been there countless times. Alice and her mother chose to live on the fifth floor for its spaciousness and good light. There was an elevator for easy access. There were several families living on the fifth floor, each with four or five rooms, including a living room, bedroom, dining room, bathroom, etc. Alice also had a beautiful study, which her classmates had also visited. Next to the study was Alice's bedroom. Although the room was not large, it was very neatly arranged, which her male and female classmates also knew. (173)</p>
<h3>Utilizing Old Textbooks</h3>
<p>— Anran</p>
<p>Textbook prices have already increased in bookstores: 50% for middle schools and 80% for primary schools. Some may think that the bookstores are deliberately being malicious, trying to make a profit amidst the rising prices of everything. However, with a little investigation, we can see that the bookstores also have their own unavoidable difficulties. Not to mention anything else, just the price of paper alone has risen from two or three dollars per ream to more than ten dollars per ream. A ream is only five hundred sheets, so it is conceivable how much the cost of textbooks has increased. Therefore, besides hoping that the bookstores will not raise prices any further, we must also think of other ways to remedy the situation regarding the textbooks that students must have.</p>
<p>The best way to remedy the situation is naturally to utilize old textbooks. It is said that the girls' association of Guanghua Middle School has already launched this movement. They have already issued circulars to the students, asking everyone to hand in their used old textbooks, stating how much they want to sell each copy for, and how much they are willing to donate to refugees after the sale. I believe that this method is currently an urgent matter for students in various schools on the isolated island. I hope that all schools will take the initiative to imitate it when school starts.</p>
<p>Such utilization of old textbooks can naturally achieve the following public benefits: (1) There is no need to increase the outlet for foreign paper. I think the bookstores would be willing to do less business and earn less money. (2) Waste is utilized, and material resources are conserved, so that textbooks that would originally be placed on a high shelf after use or discarded in a corner can still fulfill their final use and not be wasted. (3) Students' burden is reduced, and the overall social economy is stabilized, because those who sell old books will gain a little, which is a small supplement, and those who buy old books will spend a small amount of extra money and obtain the same application, which will save them a lot more.</p>
<p>What I hope is that not only middle schools should do this, but also universities, and especially primary schools! Because primary school textbooks have increased the most, and the parents of primary school students are mostly middle and lower-class families, and their economy is most difficult under this kind of pressure of life. However, primary school students do not yet have the ability to automatically organize themselves to seek their own welfare, so I especially hope that the faculty and staff of various primary schools will be willing to come forward to take charge of affairs. Some selfish and self-serving primary school authorities, if they still insist that students buy the new textbooks and new exercise books that they handle and sell, and absolutely do not allow the use of old or other substitutes, as they did last year, that should of course be subject to public criticism. I hope that this semester, it will not happen again! (Editor's note: The current Nan Zhong students have organized an "Art Book Trading Committee" to promote it in various schools.)</p>
<h3>Flowers in the Art Garden</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>“Dramatic School”</p>
<p>Produced by MGM; Showing at Cathay Grand Theatre</p>
<p>Lu Hui Reina's outstanding acting skills come from hard work and training.</p>
<p>As Wang Long's wife in "The Good Earth," she is kind, hardworking, loyal to her husband, and places her hopes on her children. She gives us a vivid image of the role of Alan. In "Flowers in the Art Garden," she plays another difficult role: a poor girl who is loyal to art and wants to work at night to earn money for tuition. She fantasizes about a beautiful world, and she yearns for a beautiful lover. After meeting the Marquis in the factory, she sows beautiful seeds deep in her heart, and she hopes that it will bloom into extraordinary flowers. However, the Marquis's fickle love gives her a severe blow, and her beautiful dream of love is shattered. On the other hand, she develops her artistic talent. When she becomes famous and obtains inner comfort, she rejects the Marquis's love and decides to dedicate herself to art.</p>
<p>Lu Hui Reina's performance, from yearning, disillusionment to success, she can strongly grasp the changes in emotions and portray the character's personality. Especially the following examples are performed more profoundly and movingly. Her sweet fantasy when she first met the Marquis in the factory; the vivid and lively fabrication of a trip with the Marquis to her classmates; her initial surprise when the Marquis appeared, followed by being flattered; her angry departure when she saw the Marquis loving another dancer in the nightclub; and finally, her heartfelt joy at the successful performance, she can use facial and eye expressions to convey psychological changes. The apotheosis of acting is breathtaking.</p>
<p>The director's portrayal of the atmosphere of the drama school is very lively. For example, the hopes of each student and the various aspects of practicing "Romeo and Juliet" are very dramatic. However, the development of the whole film is too smooth and not compact enough, because the director focuses on Lu Hui Reina, and the other characters to be portrayed are neglected. Therefore, Pauline Goddard and Alan Marshall have no achievements to speak of.</p>

<h3>Tyrone Power and Annabella to Have Marital Troubles</h3>
<p>— Tan Huibin</p>
<p>According to news from San Francisco's wireless radio broadcast, Tyrone Power, the mainstay of 20th Century Fox and Hollywood's number one star, is the most popular and handsome superstar in the world's film industry, and also the ideal lover in the hearts of tens of millions of female fans. Since he announced his marriage, not only his old lovers Sonja Henie and Loretta Young were heartbroken, but female fans (and some male fans) around the world were saddened. Many strange and difficult news had happened in Hollywood. But Tyrone was so fascinated by Annabella at that time that they finally got married despite everything. But now Hollywood brings good news to our female fans. Tyrone Power's relationship with Annabella has recently not been as close as when they were newlyweds, and there are often quarrels and disputes. Although Annabella conceded, Tyrone felt that there should be no unhappiness between husband and wife. Since it exists, it is not a blessing for the family, so he even has the intention of divorcing Annabella. In recent banquet parties, Tyrone always went alone. Annabella seemed to have understood Tyrone. She knew that he was not a steadfast lover. Wasn't Janet Gaynor deceived by Tyrone? So Annabella may not refuse a divorce if Tyrone proceeds with a separation.</p>
<h3>From "Nine Whirlwinds" Talking About Song Dezhu (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Weiwo</p>
<p>—Also Introducing Four Students from the Opera School</p>
<p>Accompanying Song Dezhu to Shanghai this time, besides the male role Yang Baosen, and the clown Ai Shiju who came to Shanghai with Mao Shilai last time, there are also Xiao Deyin, Li Debin, Song Jinsheng, and Tong Dexin.——Call them graduates of the opera school. I will now give an introduction below:</p>
<p>Xiao Deyin and Zhao Deyu and Cheng Yuhuan are known as the three outstanding Jing roles of the opera school. Deyin plays the Jiazi Hualian role, learning from Hou Xirui (some say that the students of the opera school, and the roles all learn Cheng Yanqiu, the male roles all learn Wang Shaolou, the Jing roles all learn Hou Xirui, and the clown roles all learn Cao Ergeng. There is indeed such a saying, because Yanqiu is the vice principal of the opera school, so the students all have a bit of an idol concept). All of Hou's masterpieces, such as "Famen Temple," "Bow Inkstone Yu," "Hong Fu Zhuan," "Dingjia Mountain," and "Mukezhai," Xiao is good at, and his expressions and actions are also lifelike. He was one of the first students of the opera school. Cheng Yanqiu greatly appreciated him. When Hou Xirui left the Qiu Sheng Society, Deyin was invited to join and fill Hou's vacancy. He performed in Qingdao with the Qiu Sheng Society and was very popular.</p>
<p>Li Debin has already been introduced in this magazine, but the language was vague. Debin's martial arts foundation is not bad, and his martial arts plays are quite good. Plays such as "Entering the Big Hammer," "Group Celebration Meeting," and "Picking the Village" are no less than Ye Shengian's. However, his literary plays are slightly worse. Jin Zhongren cared for Debin very much. Debin's literary plays were learned from Zhongren. After leaving the school, Debin joined Li Wanchun's Yongchun Society and Cheng Yanqiu's Qiu Sheng Society. Now, through Jin Zhongren's introduction, he entered Pu Yusheng's Qingsheng Society, specializing in matching plays with Xun Zilingxiang, and his skills have improved a lot compared to before. It is said that he has already become a disciple of Xun Huisheng. Recently, a new stage sent people north to invite actors. Huisheng strongly recommended Debin, but he already had a previous invitation with Huang Yu, so he declined the invitation from the new stage.</p>
<p>Song Jinsheng and Tong Dexin are both Song Dezhu's assistants in martial arts roles. Song Jinsheng is Dezhu's brother. His skills are not bad. However, he has not been following Dezhu for long. His qualifications and experience are not as good as Tong Dexin's. Tong Dexin has been Dezhu's assistant since the earliest days. Dezhu cannot do without him. The relationship between Dezhu and Tong Dexin is like Nine Whirlwinds and Yan Lanshi, Zhu Guifang and Zhu Xiangquan, one complementing the other, extremely able to paint the beauty of peony green leaves. Dezhu's assistants, in the earliest days, were Tong Dexin, Zhang Dezhi, Cao Derun, and Zhao Dexun. Later, Cao Derun changed careers, Zhang Dezhi passed away, and they were replaced by Zhang Jinyuan and Song Jinsheng. This time, when Dezhu came south, Zhang Jinyuan and Zhao Dexun were not on the list. Presumably only Tong Dexin and Song Jinsheng came with him.</p>
<h3>Wartime Cinemas in Spain</h3>
<p>— Qintian</p>
<p>Only Half a Mile from the Front Line; Most Attendees are Soldiers</p>
<p>When the Spanish war was at its most intense, an American photographer followed the army to shoot war news films. One night, the cold wind was fierce, and he saw many soldiers and women lined up on the street, covering their heads and pulling their collars, as if waiting for food distribution. He said to his friend very sympathetically, "These people are so pitiful!" But his friend said; "Don't worry, go and see what they are waiting for first?" Turning the corner, it turned out to be a movie theater. They were waiting to buy tickets to see the Marx Brothers' "Three Stars with the Moon." The Spanish especially liked to watch the Marx Brothers' films because these comedies mostly tore down the masks of worldly sophistication.</p>
<h3>News from the Painting and Entertainment Circle</h3>
<p>— Dongyun Writes; Xiuyun Creates Graphics</p>
<p>(14) Storytelling</p>
<p>This kind of entertainment can only be heard on the radio because the storytelling aspect is too simple and not suitable for theater performance. But it also has its advantages.</p>
<p>When there is nothing to do late at night, listening to story programs on the radio, quietly listening for half an hour, is really effective in cultivating emotions and pleasing the mind.</p>
<p>Storytelling is not that easy; without considerable knowledge, completely "referencing ancient texts" and telling stories straight from the book will never be popular.</p>
<h3>Preface to the Ankang Gathering (2)</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>There was also a Hollywood cinema, only half a mile from the front line. Soldiers fighting on the front line sometimes got leave at night to leave the battlefield and went to the theater to watch a movie before returning to the trenches on the front line. The film "A Tale of Two Cities" was also very popular with the audience, and the chivalrous behavior of Sydney Carton was widely praised.</p>
<p>These cinema entrances were usually piled with sandbags. Once, a bomb exploded at the entrance of a certain theater, and the ticket seller was killed by the bomb, but the movie continued to play.</p>
<p>Really Jin Yuan, after Jin Zhi Yelu Chucai surrendered to Yuan, he wrote the Collection of Zhanran Layman. According to his notes, it is known that there are four types of Ruan. What we in Hangzhou used to have is called the String Da Ruan, directly referred to as Ruan Xian. Another is called the Xiao Ruan, which is similar to the Double Qing of Xing 13 items, but its abdomen is different. However, they are all similar to the Sanxian, and the Sanxian is also divided into two types, one is the Haixian, its sound is broad and low, which is used for documents and Ankang, and the other is the Quxian, its sound is tight, small, and high, which is used for Southern and Northern tunes. The Quxian can be matched with a flute, and it is mostly used for singing Northern tunes. Those who sing Fu words only use it alone, or match it with the Erxian的和琴. The other three types have never been obtained by Jin and Yuan, so they cannot be used for Northern tunes. The Haixian is matched with the Pipa, so in the Yuanjian Leihan, the Pipa and the Ruan are classified as one type, and there is no distinction between the Double Qing and the Sanxian. The Double Qing is used for Shifan fine music, and the Da Ruan is the main music for the Seven Sages, so it is not used for Southern tunes. Southern tunes are also called Hua tunes, which have directly accused them of being non-orthodox sounds, but all those who play the Sanxian must sit in the central upper seat, ranking first, so their respect can be seen. The Pipa and the Heqin are divided into left and right, and the drum board is at the end, and if there are five seats, a vacant seat is waiting for guests. If there are seven people playing together, then a Zheng 笙 Xiao is added, and there is no one with empty hands. Those who play the Sanxian must sing Lao Sheng or Jing, those who play the Heqin sing Xiaosheng, the Pipa sings Dan, and the drum board belongs to Chou. Those who pluck the Zheng do not open their mouths, probably because the accent of the people of Shanxi Qin is not suitable. The so-called Heqin, or even regarded as Huqin, is not a Hu system. What we in Hangzhou call Erhe, then using the Erxian to harmonize with the Sanxian, Sixian and Thirteen strings of the Zheng, and the thirteen pipes of the Sheng, six holes of the Xiao, it can be said to be an omnipotent odd instrument, worthy of its name. Ji Kang's Yuansheng Ai Yue Lun says, a peaceful person, listening to Zheng flute Pipa, his form is irritable and his ambition is beyond, hearing the sound of Qin Se, his body is quiet and his heart is free, so I think that Heqin must have originated from Ji Kang, Ji Kang originally liked to learn Lao Zhuang, and was known for being lazy in the world, its system is suitable for its nature, and semitones are very flexible.</p>
<h3>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Shaving and Plucking Hairs are Two Major Sufferings for Actors</p>
<p>When talking about the ages of these four people, Mei is of course the oldest (probably actually over fifty, no need to state). Huisheng is next (forty-one), Xiaoyun is about the same age as Huisheng, and Yanqiu is the youngest (in his thirties). If we talk about appearance, I am afraid Lanfang is still the first, because Yanqiu is fat and strong, Huisheng is addicted to hobbies, and Xiaoyun is born as a small, refined girl, without a noble spirit, so even though Lanfang is nearly fifty years old, his stage presence is still as good as ever. In fact, he himself has naturally grown sideburns, no different from our Dean Yu, and the reason why he can make the audience below the stage unable to see it is because he is exceptionally diligent in plucking hairs in private. Above, I said that the more you shave your beard, the longer it grows, so generally male actors who play female roles rely on a pair of small tweezers to pluck the beard one by one when they have nothing to do. It is said that after plucking the husband, it will certainly grow out, but comparatively it always grows slowly and sparsely, and at the same time it is not as thick and hard as when it is shaved with a knife. The pain of plucking is of course beyond words, but since you are doing this line of work, what can you do?</p>
<p>Some people say that anyone who has been castrated will no longer grow a beard, so eunuchs have no beards. On stage, such as those who play Chen Lin, Guo Huai, and other old men, although the characters in the play live to be eighty or more, with snow-white hair and an old-fashioned appearance, they do not wear beards. (Sideburns, mouth surface, are all internal names for different types of beards) Also, actors usually do not grow beards, because growing a beard means that they will no longer perform on stage; such as the current Nine Whirlwinds, etc. Only Sheng roles, because they often wear a mouth surface, and when they are old and do not often perform, they often grow them, such as Sun Juxian, etc. Some people also say that Dan roles pluck their beards very diligently when they are young, but once they reach old age, they no longer grow, and this statement is still to be investigated for credibility.
