<p>重慶　據今晨此間所接廣西前錢華方電訊、南寗局勢緊張、因該處華方守軍、有被東南及西南兩路日軍包圍之威脅、聞日軍右翼已到達南寗東南之良慶、左翼已進抵南寗西南之同慶、同時日軍之主力部隊現正沿北海至南寗之公路向北推進、並已由南面迫近南寗云、此間軍界人士、今晨對於日方所傳南寗失守之消息、不置可否、據此間一般人士之意見、以爲該處旣已三面遭受包圍、恐失陷在所難免、惟今日下午所接桂省前綫消息、則殊堪吿慰、內稱距南寗的十里之古勞山（譯音）附近、現有激戰、據華方估計、各路日軍之兵力、合計爲四個聯隊、或的一師團强大半爲騎兵步隊、並附有輕過山砲、聞日軍企圖規避南寗以南之華軍主力、然後突襲南寗、據華方電訊、謂日軍部隊已在古勞山附近、被華軍所阻、猛烈戰事、刻正在進行中、又傳日軍已被遏阻於南寗以南之右江兩岸云、此間華軍當局、不但表示信任桂軍將能阻止日軍之前進並以爲桂省地勢艱險、日軍必將遭受極大之損失、此外尙有一要素、將使日軍受鉅大損失、卽日軍對於維持與後方之交通、恐將威覺困難是也、南寗之命運、或將在四十八小時內決定云、（廿五日路透社電）</p>

<h3 id="c10">南寗戰局與廣西精神 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>本月十五晨，日軍在北海附近登陸·當時雖經日方海軍發言人揚言登陸目標在攫取北海港口；但是事實上登陸的行動集中在欽縣防城一帶，而且登陸以後更銳意輕進，、戰事迅速蔓延到桂粵的邊境上·可見日軍攻略的目標是在南髯（邕甯）。原來欽廉一帶的海濱區域。政治上雖是屬於粵省。但是經濟上交通上却和廣西的關係更密切；南甯則左通越南，右綰欽廉。所以北海港是南甯的門戶，日軍如果攻取南甯，則其價値較高於北海。</p>
<p>日方發動這一路戰事的用意何在？說是截斷西南經由粵省的通海路綫罷，那麼北海這一港口，雖曾在幾個月以前繁榮過一時，但是自從灑洲島的日軍威脅性增大以後，中國方面已早把這一路海道交通當做告朔的餼羊·根本並不重視了。說是要佔據龍邕公路，斷絕「自由中國」與安南間的交通關係罷·可是一則事實上桂越的交通沒有滇越間的重要；再則就是桂越間的交通，也不止龍邕一道；據重慶的消息，從安南諒山到重慶之間，早已另有短距離的便捷路綫可通可見即是截斷了龍邕公路，於中國何損？－何况目前不等到日軍去截斷，桂省軍民早已把這公路毀掘了。如果說日軍陳兵桂境，用意在威脅安南，向法國示威，好像今春進攻海雨島的用意一般，這一點最爲近情，本報已經在一星期前詳細申論過，茲不贅述。至於說日軍的行動，惟在刺激他們本國的人心，作爲掩飾湘北慘敗的幌子；或者好像奕棋般的下一着閒子，作爲進攻西南的一種佈置，這雖都不是主要的作用，但也不妨是作用之一。總之日軍方面似乎還沒有考慮到自己最後的命運，所以多發動一處戰事，便沾沾自喜；這宛如一個賭徒到處碰壁以後，偏高興再找一處塲所，作孤注一擲之計，可是他總想不到這是何等冒險的舉動！</p>
<p>目前南甯的南郊已經展開了血戰，好像形勢已很危急；但是南甯的城南，就有鬱江（或稱邕江）的天險，日軍要想飛越，還必須付出十分重大的代價。何况我們還記得二月以前的長沙，也已經到了兵臨城下的險境，但是不旋踵間，日軍就全綫崩潰，倉皇敗北；以彼例此，那麼日軍在桂境的戰事，成敗得失，正未可知！</p>
<p>即使日軍能佔領南甯，但是把南甯比之長沙，得失的關係絕對沒有那樣重要；把廣西比湖南，則南甯也沒有岳陽的形勝。日軍佔據了岳陽已經期年，尙且不能寸進，屢决要想進展，却又遭到了空前的慘敗；那麼同樣的，即使取得了南甯，又何礙於桂省大局？更何礙於西南的大局？還有更重要的一點，就是日軍佔領了廣西的一角，事實上比較佔領湖南的一角更危險，因爲新中國的廣西精神與湖南精神同樣地堅實，而廣西民衆的組織比湖南更有歷史，更有基礎；換句話說，日軍踏進廣西，必然會更早註定了覆敗的命運。</p>
<p>廣西省偏處邊陲，土地磽薄，加之苗猺雜居，多所淬勵；所以民風强悍，在中國代近史上發揮了獨特的精神；如太平天國，如國民革命，都已經懋績昭宣，彪炳史册。最近十年的廣西，經當局諸賢的悉心建設，物質方面固已有飛躍的發展，精神方面更有了偉大的成就。他們把「建設廣西復興中國」做口號，所以一切設施都以民族需要爲前提，不但普及了民衆敎育，而且還普遍發展了民衆組織。廣西省的民衆組織，不但注重自治，而且更注重自衛，結果非但軍民合作，而且軍民合一。此次抗戰，桂省的健兒轉戰南北各地，功勳卓著，如淞滬，武漢等保衛戰役，無不參加，尤其台兒莊大勝，幾乎是廣西軍隊獨特的戰績。現在日軍直接進犯桂境，這正是廣西軍民合力保衛家鄕發揮民族精神的絕好機會。上回湘北大捷，白崇禧將軍已經指出了這是軍民合作的效果；何况現在到了他一手建設的廣西地方，當然一定能夠發揮更大的作用了。據聞此刻廣西省因爲日軍犯境，已經動員了全省民衆，關於拆路。移糧等積極工作，以及積極的自衛準備。都已經努力進行；可見日軍即使取得桂省寸土，無非瓦礫塲；如果再圖深入，更無非自挖墳墓！這不是咒駡，這是理智的論斷。</p>

<p>（續）日軍若要封鎖「自由中國」的最后口岸，便該攻擊雷州和拉霸（譯音）或攫福州這三口岸所佔，「自由中國」的對外貿易，都比較北海為大。據海關的紀錄本年九月份，「自由中國」的對外貿易，除戰具之外，輸入共四·二〇〇·〇〇〇金單位，輸出共八·五〇〇·〇〇〇元，「自由中國」最重要的關卡分佔數如下：</p>
<p>一九三九年九月份　地名　輸入（以金單位計）　輸出（以元單位計）</p>
<p>拉霸　七六二·八五九　二八四三三〇八</p>
<p>龍州　五七七·〇七四　二五七〇六七〇</p>
<p>雷州　五六四·七〇八　二〇六七六〇一</p>
<p>福州　九〇七·一九五　六三一七九</p>
<p>蒙自　五七九·〇九七　三八四二〇</p>
<p>北海　六九·六八五　八三六五三〇</p>
<p>這六處關卡，佔重慶控制區域出口的百分之九十九以上，入口的百分之九十五。此外，龍州和蒙自有很重要的戰具和其他軍用品運輸交通，這一點和普通貨物的交通，使龍州和蒙自兩地成爲「自由中國」邊界上最重要的對外貿易中心地。蒙自是滇緬鐵路上的關卡，衆所熟知。這條鐵路的運輸力，在兩年前每月的三千噸，目前已由法國銀行團而增至二萬噸以上，預定到廢歷明年新歲，將達三萬噸左右。今日自南方通入「自由中國」的兩大陸上貿易道路，其一便是這法國鐵路，若華方克服困難，而對循鐵路運抵滇省的一切貨物，迅即全部分運他處，那末，這鐵路可運更多的貨物。</p>
<p>一般人對於龍州，不像對蒙自那樣的熟知，且似乎認爲除通昆明的法國鐵路之外「自由中國」南部的陸上貿易道路另一條是滇緬公路，這種印象，是錯誤的。實則另一條公路是海防通龍州到邕寗的路錢，將道條道路的交通來比較，滇緬公路上的貿易，實不足道。龍州不但取道越南鐵路西北部終站的諒山而和海防相通，且有此次中日戰爭期內所造的第一流現代汽車道直達河內，這設備完善的汽車路繼續自龍州稍向西北而入桂南內地，直達邕寗。本年整年內，利用這條道路上的大規模汽車交通，入口品源源而入「自由中國」，較諸取道法國鐵路到昆明的入口品，有增無减，祗是華方對這道路不願多事宜傳而已。</p>
<p>粵漢鐵路阻斷或喪失時這龍邕路便是對外交通的要道。中政府在兩年前已明知此路的重要性，一九三八年一月，中政府和戰前擔任建造渝蓉鐵路的法國銀行團訂立合同，規定不造渝蓉鐵路而敷設邕寗到越南邊界鎭南關的鐵路，所定路軌，幾乎和龍邕路相平行。此綫的敷設，應在一年前吿竣，但有許多並非常是技術上的困難，一再使工作延宕起來。邕寗區人民似乎很反對這鐵路計劃，近幾月來，纔加速建造，確定來歲一月落成。銜接邕寗和柳州（自衡陽經桂林的廣西新鐵路，暫以柳州爲南部終點。）的鐵路，擬在明年夏秋季敷設。（未完）</p>

<p>愛情決非婚約所能保證</p>
<p>婚姻而有契的，這是世界各國所通行，在法律上得以相互的保障與證明，固屬重要，但決不能以此來保證男女間的愛情。婚姻應以愛情爲基礎，這是誰也不能否認的。今愛情旣不能以婚的來保證，那婚姻豈不很危險嗎？曰：不不然。婚約果然不能以之來保證愛情，但男女雙方性機能的恒久健康，確是愛情鐵的保證。自愛男子，早年絕未犯有自凟遺精，婚後亦不荒淫縱慾，性能的永恒健康，那是必然的。這種精强力足的男子，自能與愛妻的性潮相協調，在雙方都興趣濃烈時，愛的生活是何等的歡暢而甜蜜！同時「淸心寡慾多男子」，子女的伶俐，家庭的美滿，眞是一團喜氣，其樂融融！就是到老來白首齊眉，兒孫滿堂，爲親友所稱頌，爲社會所尊重，人生是多麼有意義而幸福！反之，如男子而早年浪漫，犯有自凟遺精，或婚後荒淫無度，那性機能必受其嚴重摧殘，爆發着早洩陽痿，發育不全，神經衰弱，腎虧乏嗣等症，在夫婦間性生活上不能達到美滿之目的，或竟完全不能人道者，則雖與妻子曾訂下山盟海誓之婚的，她亦必感覺靑春蹉跎之可悲，人生寂寞而無味，終至感情破裂，白眼相加，或竟與人私通私奔，振振有詞與夫訴請離婚之訟者，在時代女性亦多不勝計！</p>
<p>男子漢大丈夫遭此境遇，豈不可恥而亦可悲乎？！欲謀補救與預防，據世界名醫及余經騐，均以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最爲對症特效，因此劑係由雄壯動物如猩猩，熊鹿，獅虎，海狗等體中提取的生殖腺內分泌精華，用科學複製法製成，其中有效成份完全保存，所以品質貴重，功效確實而迅速，爲任何類似製劑所不及，服後於一日夜間卽生精補腎，健腦活血，允宜連服不斷，則更助長發育，滋養神經，短期內必可根治各症。連服一冬，體重增加，延年益壽，中老年人則返老還童，得重享靑春幸福，這是鐵一般的事實：德國名醫（Ｗeldean）惠爾登博士屢將此劑作臨床實騐，在三千六百五十四個病例中，根據生殖腺內分泌補給療法之原理，使其繼續不斷服用「生殖素」，結果，一千二百三十一個發育不全者，一千八百七十個早洩陽痿者，五百四十九個腎虧乏嗣者，均能得滿意的治療之功。允以其中有四分之一的中年早衰者，確得益壽延年，返老還童，是以此劑卽馳名全球，譽爲男女的唯一大補劑。今在本埠中西五洲等大藥房亦均有出售。余以此劑治愈息者亦已有數萬人。惟患遺精者，須兼服治遺聖藥「希米脫氏固精片」（每盒實價兩元）以鞏固精關，制止遺洩，收速允速！患者若能親來本診所診治，當更安全可靠。</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>歐美婦女，不但文化水準較我國媳女爲高，即於她們的愛美一點，也比我國婦女高明多多。作者昨天會經讀到一本法國愛兒雪娜女士著的『戰時的幸福家庭，』內容除闡述她們在戰時狀况下所負的責任是如何重大之外。有一叚便論到她們的整個幸福問題，她說『一個女子而欲獲得無上幸福，便不能忽略了全身各部的發育，而尤其不能忽略了乳峯，因爲乳峯如果發育佳良，呈隆然高聳貌，無疑的臀部亦必丯腴玲瓏，那麽女性最神秘而可貴的曲線美就形成了，自然身叚嬝娜，不由男子們不向妳傾到，而妳也儘可放開眼光，去選擇一個如意郞君，來度溫馨甜蜜的歲月，那不是幸福無量嗎？反之，如果妳的乳峯因自凟束胸，白帶不感，營養不佳，月經不調等症而致萎癟或平坦一如男子者。則聰明而浮滑的丈夫，他肯放妳過門嗎？卽使這個男子富有涵養，夫婦間亦難免貎合神離，還有甚麼情好可言？自然更談不到幸福。要是遇到見異思遷，愛情不專的男子，那其命運的悲慘，更是不堪設想』欲謀補救，祗有信賴科學，據中西著名醫師與余經騐。均公認以服卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』最爲對症而特效。服後一日夜間卽可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖宮止帶，倘繼續連服一冬，不惟可使萎癟的乳峯，隆然高聳，同時且能紅潤面頰，增進夫婦間的愛情，而幸福無量。</p>
<h3 id="c117">遺精症的前因後果 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>美國衛生家顧立克博士說：『健康爲切的出發點』，誠是至理名言。要是一個病弱之軀，終日安坐而食，已感乏力，還能做得什麼？靑年人因患遺精症而致失健者何能勝數，他們類多因犯自凟，同性愛，早婚，縱慾等行爲，摧殘了性神經，使精關鬆弛之故。此外好學靑年用腦用力過度或先天衰弱病後失調及患神經衰弱者，均有爆發遺精滑精症的可能。精液爲我人生命的源泉，在生理上係經過高級分化作用而製成，旣爲生殖上的主要原質，又能滋養神經，調節情緒，助長發育，調整新陳代謝等作用。若患遺精而以爲無關痛癢，因循失治，除直接影響於生殖機能繼續起着早洩陽痿，發育不全，腎虧乏嗣等症外，凡腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，未老光衰，精力萎靡，面黄肌瘦等症象亦必不一而足。試問此種病弱靑年，如何在學術上職業上作自我奮鬥與人競爭，來達到光明之目的。至於在夫婦間愛情基礎的生活上，那更萎弱無能，或竟完全一通人道，恒引起家庭間之種種悲劇！所以凡患遺精者，務須早日根治，一則治療易，二則元氣少虧。治療之法：惟有速服世界馳名治遺聖藥「希米脫氏固精片」則於服後即可鞏固精關，鎮靜神經，常夜可收安眠止遺之神效，如已有上述症象之一種或數種者，務須兼服雄壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，增益精血，能連服不斷，必可於短期內根治各症。恢復美滿健康。患者如能親來本診所施用電療注射等法，更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3 id="c118">西北的輸廓 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— 芒</p>
<p>西北的被人注意，遠在抗戰以前，不過到了抗戰以後，西北在國防上的重要性，才愈益明顯，一切開發西北富源，開闢西北的交通計劃，才由國府積極進行。中國抗戰建國的浪潮，捲入了西北，以驚人人的速度，完成了各項初步的基本設施，這確是抗戰以來一件可喜的現象。</p>
<p>地理上的西北</p>
<p>所謂西北，就其輸廓講，包括陜西，甘肅，青海，新疆，綏遠，寗夏等省的全部，外蒙的一部以地形論，是高原地帶，拔海平均在一千幾百公尺以上，面積遼闊，人口稀少，甘肅平均每方公里只有一五人，綏遠平均每方公里只有七個半人，寗夏平均，每方公里只有一·三八人，比之江浙，眞不知相差多少遠。故西北不但是今後抗戰的根據地，並且是將來移殖東南稠密人口的尾閭。</p>
<p>歷史上的西北</p>
<p>就歷史上講，自周秦至漢唐，西北向為中國政治文化中心。漢挨盛時，據邊塞而控制中原，與塞北各民族，角逐於這一帶，歷幾千年之久。保持了西北，常是漢族國運隆盛時代，而失去了西北，常是漢族勢力衰退時代。緣西北與內地，常如唇齒相輔，關中是西蜀的屏蔽，而甘肅綏遠新疆，又是關中的屛蔽。晋劉裕領軍北伐，他的勢力，已達到關中，可是因爲那時的寗夏，在赫連勃勃的手中，結果終爲赫連勃勃所乘，而將關中陷人了胡人之手。南宋所以能够把四川保持達百年之久的，也就因爲吳璘吳玠等有和尙原之捷，使金人不敢自陝南下窺蜀。現在日人所採取的侵略路綫，也自山西窺陜，由陜而趨川。所以我們要保衛四川，必須首先保衛西北。今年春天，某國大使動身歸國的時候，對我國人士，鄭重勸吿，保衛西北，屛蔽西南，是我國謀恢復失土的第一要着。這裏面的含義，自然深長，決不能視同泛泛</p>
<p>國際交通上的重要</p>
<p>蓋自抗戰軍興以來，我們吃了沒有海軍的腐，沿海口岸，或巳淪陷，或已爲敵方控制，而所賴與國際交通之口岸，僅爲西北西南兩孔道，西南之國際交通錢，須借道英法屬地，而唯一可直接與他國交通的孔道，即爲由西北通蘇聯。在這意義下，西北不但是屛蔽西南的重地，也是國際交通的孔道，所可惜的，現在由西北達西南各地，在交通上的成就，僅爲公路一項，至於横貫南北的鐵路幹綫，尙付缺如。爲輸送大量重兵器的需要，我們在這一方面，還有積極進行的必要。</p>
<p>西北各民族的團結</p>
<p>再就西北民族方面言之，西却是種族複雜的地帶，有漠族，蒙古族，畏吾兒（纏回）藏族等區別，這些種族，過去因爲言語的各異，宗敎的不同，及政治上的不平等待遇，往往鬧出許多糾紛，自然不是國家民族之福。所幸抗戰以後，各民族不分彼此，一致擁護中央，共同對外作戰，各民族的團結，更趨密切。况巨現在主持西北軍民的大員，如寗夏的馬鴻逵將軍，如靑海的馬步芳將軍馬步靑將軍等，都是擁護中央的回敎的軍政領袖，必能率領勇敢的回教徒與其他種族的人，捍衛疆土。今後所應注意的問題，自然千端萬緒，非一言所能盡。然就其大者重要者言之，無他，仍在開發資源，以充國力，在敎育人材，以爲國用，管子有言『地不闢非我之地，民不敎非我之民』，當此外患日迫的時候，允宜對於這兩者，加倍注意。</p>
<h3 id="c119">大西北的心臟關中雜寫　進可以取退可以守　人强食足地勢險固 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>關中，即現在的陝西，北枕長城，南倚秦嶺，黄河縈繞於西，隴山逶迤於東，是一個很大的湓地。因位於潼，散，武，蕭四關的中央，故稱關中·這裏自古就是勁兵健馬的地方，秦人不但以尙武著稱，而且還勇於公戰，所以卒能滅六國，統一天下，以成帝業。漢武帝拓境開邊，北地良家子，奏功常最。班固說的：「自秦漢以來，關東出相，關西出將，」眞是中的之評。唐名將郭子儀論關中時，亦會道：「地方數千里，帶甲數十萬，兵强士勇，雄視八方，有利則出攻，無利則入守，此用武之國，非天下所同。」可見秦人英勇的一斑了。</p>
<p>至於物產，則沃野千里，小麥，棉花，高粱等，產量豐足，每逢暮春時節，平原的麥浪，層層疊疊，有如萬頃的波濤，故有「陸海」之稱。礦產以煤和石油，最佔重要，秦嶺以北，自隴湃達同官，韓城，北經延安以至神木，有極廣厚的煤層，據說蘊藏量有四千七百多萬噸·石油區域，北至葭縣，米脂，南至宜君，同官，西至安塞，東至黄河，到處有油苗發見，油田面積，的十五萬方里。現在，石油官廠，即設在延安的西門外，假使能用新式方法採掘和提鍊，對於抗戰，一定大有助力。因爲人民英勇，地勢險固，物產又這樣富足，所以周，秦，隋，唐諸朝，都建都於此。</p>
<p>這裏的文化在古時非常發達，爲我國文化的中心。至今關中保存的古蹟，文物，還很豐富，只要有志研究文化的人，一到這裏，便可以搜集到不少寳貴的文獻資料，那是一定的。</p>
<p>這裏的交通，自從潼關到西安的那段隴海路築好後，非常便利。軍興以來，爲了溝通國外交通計，工程艱巨的中蘇大道，在軍民的合作下，也全綫通車了，這條路，就是通過關中平原，以西安爲貨運的總站，聽說中蘇鐵道，也在計劃建築中了。現在，隴海路的東段，虽告淪胥，但從洛陽到西安的那段，仍暢通無阻，負着軍運的重任。至於中蘇公路，更是抗戰中一條大動脈·在過去，它已盡過不少的力量了。</p>
<p>這裏的名勝古蹟，多得不可勝計，因爲西安是古代的都城，所以在城郊及其附近，到處都是古墓和古宮的遺址，占墓中最爲時人注目的，要算黄帝的轎陵，墳在咸陽城外，年來中央每年派有政洽要員，前往祭掃，所謂「民族掃墓，就是指此，其他則文王陵，始皇陵，武帝陵（一稱茂陵）等，都在這裏，可惜因飽經世變，大多已荒榛滿地了·至於古宮，較著的有長樂，未央，阿房，建章等，現在祗剩遺跡，供人憑弔罷了。關中的都市，當首推西安，它不但是古都，在一一二·一二」事變中，蔣委員長蒙難於此，西安的大名，曾喧騰於世界人士口中。其他則黄河古渡的潼蘭，「紅色首都」的延安，漢水上流的南鄭，渭北的商埠三原，都是重要的城市·在此日軍對關中躍躍欲試的當兒，希望關中健兒，奮起衛國，保持着祖先的光榮史蹟！</p>
<h3 id="c120">抗戰中生長的甘肅 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— 蕙滋</p>
<p>戰爭對於中國，誠然是一種破壞，但對於文化落後的甘肅，卻給予一種新的力量和生機。甘肅位於我國西北，離開上海的的九百八十哩；中部和四周都是山，最著名的是崑崙山系？黄河和渭水灌注的於南部。</p>
<p>抗戰後由於各地不斷的移民，使她大改舊觀：許多前進的靑年，具有新的思想和健全的體魄，在這决戰事中喪失了家園的，都不斷的移殖到甘肅去，於是這古老而封建的蘭州，一躍而爲中國實業和運輸的中心，同時又是中國入蘇聯的交通孔道。</p>
<p>一八六六年時，左宗棠曾在蘭州建立兵工廠，最近中央政府即就舊廠加以整頓和改進，蘭州就成爲中國軍需品重要供給地之一。這裏有許多飛機製造廠和機件裝配塲，這機件裝配塲人員，不僅有許多中國和蘇聯的專家，還有許多美國的航空工程師。基本的工人，都是國人，他們大部是從東方移殖過去的。由於工廠中不斷的需要工人，以及其他築路濬河等工作，都需要强壯的男子，所以農場的工作，都委諸婦女，她們最重要的工作，就是植棉和採棉。</p>
<p>新建設事業中最重要的當推公路的建設。而公路中最重要的一綫，就是蘭州到新疆綫—中蘇公路的中段。蘇聯供給中國的貨物，和中國出口運往蘇聯的原料，都取道於此。在這公路上來往的車千，大部份是蘇聯的專爲載鉅重而製成的大而且重的車子，形式上很像過去幾年美國的車子，小部份則爲新式的美國的道奇車。一甘肅除了棉花以外，其他產業的前途，也很有希望，允其是煤業，有更大的展望。總之，戰爭所給予甘肅的新生命力很多，甘肅省在不久的將來，會有一個新的面目顯示出來</p>
<h3 id="c121">開鑿中的　西北四大新渠 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>中國政府自抗戰以來，始終抱着「抗戰建國」的目標，努力邁進。為改良后方農業，「以裕經濟而厚民生」起見，對於西北的水利工程特別注意。去夏在陝西、甘肅、寗夏等省築成了液漑農田的四大渠，化二千萬百萬元。現在又在開鑿左列四道新渠了。</p>
<p>一·洛惠渠</p>
<p>洛惠渠是四大新渠中最重要的溝渠，在陜西的中部。開鑿工程發動於四年之前，現在快築成了。工程費计二百萬元。全渠支渠縱橫渠長達交錯，形狀略如蛛綱。總幹渠長達一百四十五里（市里）。全渠計有滾水壩一道；隧洞五道，最長的達一里；水閘二處；橋梁四十五架；退水渠（卽出水暗溝）三十一道。全渠水量足夠灌溉農田二千二百五十萬畝以上。</p>
<p>二·黑惠渠</p>
<p>黑惠渠橫貫於陝西中部產棉產麥的地帶。開鑿本渠的最大原因是那里雨量的不平衡·工程費預計十六萬元。現在計整屋縣境內黑水河上正興建水閘，就把這條河作為總幹渠再分向二岸地區開鑿幹及支渠。全渠水量預定可以灌溉農田五百四十萬畝。</p>
<p>三·涇河的疏導</p>
<p>陝西西南部的商業中心寳鶏與鳳翔原有涇河的支流分布着，可是河身未加疏導，致不能盡灌漑農田的大用。現在政府就將涇可的支流加以疏導，司時開鑿新渠，使渠水足以灌溉涇河左岸的肥田五百四十萬畝。全渠工程正在積極進行中。總幹渠長達六十五里，隧洞長三千三百八十尺；大水壩之外，還有注水大閘閘道，橋梁四十架，退水渠三十道。全渠需費七十三萬元。</p>
<p>四·黃惠渠</p>
<p>黄惠渠在甘肅。於二十二年七月曾由中央政府出資二十五萬元築成通惠渠一道，黄惠渠是該省第二道大渠。渠水引自中部的永登縣境內的黃河。總幹渠長達五十里。水量足以灌漑農田一百六十一萬畝，工程費預計三十萬元</p>

<p>二，陝西甘肅產騾，靑海產馬，二者久巳馳名海外。</p>
<p>三，西北所產之羊，佔全　國產額百分之七十五，山羊佔百分之四十。馬佔百分之三十五，牛佔百分之二十。</p>
<p>四，西北多山區域，有遺下未開發之森林地帶，沿西部地帶亦有樅木森林，爲製木漿之最好原料。</p>
<p>五，陝西蘊藏大量之白煤，約計七一九五〇百萬噸，綏遠有烟煤四一四百萬噸。</p>
<p>六，陝西延長附近及甘肅之玉門敦煌，新疆之烏魯木齋，綏來，烏蘇，塔城，均產石汕，目下延長三井中每日可掘得石油七五〇〇斤。</p>

<h3 id="c125">青海……亞洲的中心 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— 辛環</p>
<p>亞洲之中</p>
<p>崑崙居天下之中雖然是自神話時代就留下的傳說，但就亞洲大陸這範圍以內說，牠却是恰巧正在中心。亞洲的整個圖形，雖有些書上說是梯形，却無寗認之爲圓。亞洲東南的羣島形成的綫，西北烏拉山形成的綫，西南波斯灣形成的綫，都是相當正形的圓弧，把這些圓弧連成圓圈，則超出圈外的僅有西南的小亞細與亞刺伯半島，和東北的佛柯揚斯克區。這圓的中心是在中國靑海界內，較限制地說，是在星宿海。如果有由列奪格勒到上海，由卡拉奇到廟街的直行航空綫，其交义點也在靑海境內。</p>
<p>實際意義</p>
<p>道種理論上的中心，於實際上有什麽意義呢？就事實上所見，在過去交通上，牠曾顯出牠的中心地位，而以後交通將是有計劃地作開化的前導的設施時，對這中心地位允不容忽略。由東部入藏的道路，西寗，都蘭，玉樹一綫，是遠較康定，巴安，昌都一錢爲易走的；由東部入新的道路，雖是嘉峪關一綫較便，但如赴于闐一帶，則都蘭，婼羗一綫實較少風沙之苦，其不便僅在沿錢沒有居民而已；由靑海向東北，沿黄河道的路錢是通用的；由靑海向東南，則沿鴉磬江，金沙江，也都有舊交通路，從此路入靑，再折往西藏的交通綫，要比横斷西康入藏的交通綫略易建設。如此，中國實有設以靑海爲中心的輻射式的交通綫的可能。本來，以蘭州爲中心的交通計劃，形勢即與此彷彿，而在其西也本也有以宗扎薩克爲交點的蘭州·拉薩錢，成都·宗扎薩克綫，宗扎薩克·婼羗綫三輔助綫。如這些綫·都完成，則宗扎薩克這一中心，事實上必奪去蘭州的中心地位，因爲由此可有較短的經長江而出海的道路。</p>
<p>歷史的根據</p>
<p>這交通錢仍然是帶理想性的，成都—宗扎薩克—婼羗這一綫所經過的將是一切路綫中的全部經過最少人烟的區域的。但是，這一帶的人烟稀少，實是自來忽視森林牧畜業的結果，以前游牧民族却常以靑海爲趨集點，所以歷史上靑海倒是國內諸族會集的地方漢族本身就有起源於崑崙之墟之說；羌族是始終以這裏爲根據嚈噠爲藏族之說，則藏族也曾以靑海爲居地；匈奴的本地，恐也在此；連東方的鮮卑，也有一支到此建過吐谷渾國；突厥起源在金山之陽之說雖不定可信，但回紇確以此爲活動中心，所以回紇，吐番，在唐代幾有混合的趨勢；西夏以宕項羗成立大國，始終未讓契丹勢力侵入，其力量就是聚回紇，吐番等等而成的；夏的文化相常高，頗能够調燮所屬諸族；不過經蒙古帝國的摧毀，此地遂成爲蒙，番爭競之地，以迄於今；在元代蒙藏的關係尙好，使其變壞的是淸代的扶藏抑蒙的政策，加以淸對回族特別嚴刻，允防衛其和藏構通，於是靑海才成人口寥落之地。現在諸族政治地位旣已平等，所存的不過生存權利侵佔上的猜疑，苟作有計劃的開發，應即輸入資財，先使其生活較裕，有了寬裕的生活，則各族自又紛集，紛集就益增繁盛。如知道集合是繁盛的因，一定也就知道把相互關係改好的。單就這裏是羗，藏，蒙，回，集會之點說，這也是國內民族問題上最重要的地方，這裏的開發實是不可緩的。</p>
<p>青海的礦產</p>
<p>森林與牲畜的前途有多大希望，自難斷言，靑海一的地理環境，也許要使牠們的一發展受很大的限制。可是另一種富源，礦產，這裏却是很充一足的。松潘，二凱，婼羌，于一闐，都是產金之區，相同的靑海也本有金產，而其產量之富，或許非想像所及。其他礦產，這裏也應不缺乏。雖然這一帶的地質，未經仔細勘察過，但大致公認是屬於瓦里斯干造山系，即是相當於歐洲的包括薩爾，波希米亞，多尼决，烏拉爾，諸礦產區的山系的地帶。年代雖或較早，這樣的地帶內，礦產應不缺乏。這山系的向東延長部份，陰山，秦嶺，岷山一帶，礦產也頗豐富，也足見這帶可有礦產。靑海或者是一不讓美於貝加爾區的地方建造西伯利亞鐵路時還未能想到貝加爾的富饒，我們倒是可把靑海的富饒計算在內而建造成都。婼羌路的。不先有便利的交通，恐連探勘的進行也少有希望。</p>
<p>仍退到最起碼的話說，縱然一切的條件，和其有希望的前途，不是容許冒昧侈說的，單單理論上牠是亞洲的中心這一點，在感情上我們也會覺是可以矜誇的，矜誇可以引起珍視，而珍視的方法是賦以光彩。那末在心理上，我們也會覺得這是該致力的地方吧。</p>

<p>— 菊</p>
<p>畜牧與狩獵爲西北主要富源之所在，該地居民的衣食住行，賴獸類供給者極多。其肌肉及乳酪，在現在西北罐頭食品廠尙未遍設的時候，這些美味，只好讓他們自己享受。不過獸類的皮毛經過製作後可以販運他處，你不久將穿的黄黄皮裘，多半是彼地的出產。</p>
<p>皮毛的輸出，單以新疆一省，在市况最不佳的駝運時期，每年也値一，八四九，一〇〇元。如西北各省均計算在內，在抗戰前有七千萬餘元的輸出。</p>
<p>皮的種類有狐皮，獺皮，狼皮，掃雪皮，灰鼠皮，猞猁皮，野狸皮，野猴子皮，白羔皮，紅羔皮，狗皮等，毛如駝毛羊毛等。</p>
<p>近來某國人在天津設了一個西北皮毛交易總局，並派一般奸商在包頭設立分局，四出收買西北的皮毛，據說以五六十元一百斤買入，運到天津就値三百元。原來皮毛的出口地一向爲天津，自從淪陷後，就被統制，壟斷把持，才能做一本萬利的生意呀！</p>

<h3 id="c127">延長的石油 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>在西北各行省中，石油的產量，以陝西爲多；而陝西一省之中，又以北部的延長縣屬各區的產量最爲豐旺。在這一縣縱横五十里內的出產，幾乎可以超越膚施，洛川等地的總額，油苗遍露，其藏量之富足，可見一斑。然而陝西的石油市塲，歷來何以被控制於洋商的掌握？簡單地說來，就是：阻於交通，困於經濟，限於開發的人力，所以只能小規模的從事鑿井採取，因而，其產量也只够供給附近的需要，無限量之寳藏，尙窖埋於地，並非陜西之眞正貧瘠。</p>
<p>近年來，我政府積極從事建設與開發富源。全省公路網旣完成，而該區油泉亦利用科學方法採取，製煉。前曾與美商訂的開採未成之各油區，均已再度工作；李家莊，烟霧溝等處的油泉也都積極地在開採，非但掃除了運輸困難的隔膜，且摒絕採油的老法，亦增加了不少產量，大有突飛猛進之勢。</p>
<p>全縣以西門外的延長石油廠規模較大，每一油井備置有二十匹馬力的汽機一座及五十匹馬力的鍋爐一座。以一三七等號的新井產油最多，每日的產原油自八十加侖至一千加侖不等，因其產量是不固定的，設若本月每日產原油三百加侖，下月每日產原油一千加侖，而再下月每日則又產五百加侖，都是無法預測的。</p>
<p>各油井的採取工作，現在都把機器代簪了人力，每天開始採油前，都用馬達機抽水（從前係用人搖帮浦）。大的抽過三小時，井中的水盡而原油就繼着出現，這種原油出現後，只可抽幾分鐘至半小時，油就吿盡。原油由井中抽出後，即從輸送管送入貯油池（池的大小不一，最大的可容五萬加侖，最小的可容二千加侖。）</p>
<p>現在該談到原油出井後的製煉法了。所謂原油就是未經製煉的，並非即可應用的石油。原油由貯油池輸入煉油爐（容量可一千加）後，即開始燒火煉油，原油受熱而成沸，而發出蒸汽體，即係汽體油。汽體油經過漏器而注入輸送管，經過冷水池，即變爲液體油，再加硫酸（Ａcid　Ｓulphuric）漂凈，然後入貯油池。每一千加侖原油，經製煉後，約可出三百至四百加侖石油，所需煤的二百。</p>
<p>原油旣經煉製出石汕，鍋爐中尙剩下大量的渣滓，此渣滓即係「蠟」，黄黑色，再經漏製就變成白蠟，可製洋燭。</p>

<p>— 友仁</p>
<p>蒙古包就是蒙古人普通的住所。包下面是用土築，頂上舖着皮氈，可以隨時移動遷徙的。這種蒙古包，仍不足奇，最奇者是進蒙古包時有一種手續：（一）先得把手裏拿着的皮鞭放在門外，因爲拿着鞭子進鬥，是蒙古人的大忌，他們以爲這樣將不利於他們的牲口。（二）蒙古包的門分左右兩個，右邊是人門，左邊是鬼門。所以進蒙古包時應注意由右門進出。（三）包內陳設除炊具外，多是佛像和念珠等。但到蒙古包去的人，千萬不要碰到他們的鍋灶，他們信這鍋灶裏還有火神的。</p>
<p>奇異的習俗（一）他們的居住能可遷移，但不能逸出本境界限。（二）除喇嘛廟之外不許造房子。（三）在家人不許鉸頭髮。（四）境內男子女子無論何時，不許晚去長衣。（五）惟有喇才可以穿黄色衣服，別人不得妄用。（六）誰都不能穿黑衣。（七）本旗女子不許隨意嫁給旗人（是指別種旗人）還有什麼不許提長鞭子，不許着仰底鞋，不許喝酒，不許抽烟。他們鼓惑人信佛和尊奉喇嘛。蒙古最特特別最奇異的風俗便是他們很歡喜別的人到他們處居住，但沒有床，大家均大被同眠於土抗上，男女沒有分開，客人和他家裏的女子並列而臥，也沒有什麽出奇，不過翌晨起身時，他見你和他的妻女相背而睡，則十分歡喜，且以你爲上賓，若相對而臥，則認你有姦淫他的妻女行爲，必把你所有的牲口截了尾巴，則你到處都不能投宿。</p>

<p>還記得幼時讀一首昭君出塞的詩，頭二句是：「回首長門淚暗流，氈城春似漢宮秋！」第三句已記不得，第四句是：「奴正顧時妾正愁！」在一燈如豆，朔風蕭颯的時候讀之，往往也掉下淚來。腦海裏浮起來的影子是：氈城的春，不及我們「出門吹面已風薰，春在垂柳慘淡中」的春了，其冬季的冷是可想而知，紅顏薄命弱不禁風的昭君怎樣受得起這種嚴烈的氣候。不要臉的漢元帝，打不過單于，忍心把她送給他，以討主子的好，所以昭君回首漢宮長門，淚不敢明揮，只得暗流。這正同最近的幾位蘇州小姐被聘訪問某國，也許她們也暗流着淚呢！」讀「正顧」「正愁」，人非木石，誰不一揮同情之淚啊！</p>
<p>昭君姓王名嬤，湖北秭歸人，爲我國四美人之一。十七歲時以貌美被選爲宮女，過着「淚滴閒階長綠苔」的生活。後來呼韓邪單于侵犯邊境，朝廷極力主和，單于要花姑娘，昭君就做了犧牲品。她的墳在綏遠歸化城的南方二十里，墓地周圍有三十畝，墳高差不多二十丈，前豎一碑，爲漢明妃墓。」有好些殘碑，字跡難辨。新建的碑中，有一塊題着「懦夫愧色。這倒値得深思猛省一下的。</p>

<p>— 次愷</p>
<p>照許多事實看來，發明不是一件容易的事。這並非我來打斷諸位的勇氣，却是我來鼓勵諸位的話。四五年前，我還是一個小孩子，也看過許多發明家的故專，同時我也想做個發明家。可是現在才知道我決配不上。瓦特看見鍋蓋掀動便發明蒸汽機的話，是靠不住的，實在在瓦特以前，湯姆牛科孟已造出蒸汽機了，他不過把它改了一改。馬可尼的發明無綫電也不是他一個人的力量，原來他的時候早有人發現電波了。牛頓見蘋果落地便發現地心吸力，也因爲他原來有根底，我們所以不會看見栗子落地而也發明地心吸力，並不是已被他發現過，却是我們太沒有根底了。</p>
<p>許多偉大的發明都是有很好的根底，或者他人研究的帮助，一個人發明的東西，恐怕是很少的。拍琴氏十七歲就發明了有名的煤黑油染料，他實在是得力於一位有名老師的指導的。達爾文的創出生存競爭說，也就得力於旅行，討論，和人家的著作，有人說達爾文若是生於中國，恐怕不會有這樣大的發明的。這是實話。</p>
<p>但是有許多發明却並不費怎樣大的氣力，小的像某人的發明橡皮頭鉛筆，大的像威爾遜想從石灰中提鈣而發明乙炔的製法，可說是出於偶然的，幾年前美國有一位科學家發現養金魚的車輪藻放在水裏，孑　就不會產生，引起許多人研究它，這類的發明却又比較的輕而易舉。我國有許多工業上的發明，差不多都是沒有受過高深敎育的人做的，溫州有一位阿蒙，小學沒有畢業，後來也發明了木製彈花機器，開了鐵廠，許多讀了幾十年書的人反而學不上他。</p>
<p>讀書的時代把發明的天才埋沒了，那是很可惜的。不過要發明，現在的時候，還是努力多讀新書做基礎的好。</p>

<p>— 影呆譯</p>
<p>這是一個悲哀的故事—關於被人遺忘而破舊的的玩具的故事。</p>
<p>在暗黑的壁橱裏面，它們是被錮禁着，滿身是灰塵，再也不會被幸福兒童可愛的小手觸及。因此，它們要寫一封公開的信，寄給佛及尼，瑪麗，威廉姆，弗蘭克林，和其他的上海小朋友。信上是這樣的寫着：</p>
<p>親愛的慈悲小朋友：</p>
<p>可憐我們吧，哦，請可憐我們吧！我們生氣全無的被鎖住在你們的壁橱裏，小屋子裏，黑暗的屋角裏。光榮的日子是過去了。鄰時節，你們把我們放在新的盒子裏面，時常把我們拿出來玩要，細看，好像對我們非常的愛慕和珍惜的樣子。現在我們是老了，身體和精神也都衰弱了，不再値得你們一顧了。琪恩你聽見我們嗎？瑪麗，陶樂珊，和約翰，迪克，鮑爾，請靜聽我們的申訴吧？</p>
<p>在上海，正有着許多小朋友，他們從來沒有見過我們的面，從來不曾和你們一樣的把我們玩弄過。這些孩子，很想得到我們對着我們談笑，向我們表示熱愛。因此，請你們把我們拿出來去修理過了，加上新的漆飾，這樣我們又可看見有孩子們來要我們，對着我們笑，並拿着我們玩了</p>
<p>假如你們願意這樣，可打電話三四二二〇，就會差人來拿我們去，送進扶輪玩具醫院。那邊可把我們的面貌，機器，完全修好。在這醫院裏，是可使人驚奇的，他們會把我們修得像新的一樣。唯一的目的，就在把我們在黑暗中救出來，這樣可使我們期待一個偉大的日子—耶穌聖誕日。那一天，你們將很高興的知道我們能够再度很快樂的去使別的孩子快樂。你們的老朋友又可再世而把快樂送給別個孩子了。</p>

<p>— 正白</p>
<p>新年一瞬眼的逝去了。在村里人的心目中，似乎這新年是異常的短促，雖然這幾天來已是盡量的狂歡，還不能十分的滿足。而明兒家裏的每一個人相反地感覺到這新年是特別的漫長，眼見得人家度年，而回想到往年過新年的欣喜，時時會觸景生情，而徒然引起他們的惆悵。</p>
<p>那時當然已是隆冬季節，西北風猖獗非常，一天到晚，遇著人面便使出它刮削的手段。害得那些村裏人躱在家中不敢伸出半個頭來。樹梢間的呼呼聲連一接二的在嘯，比了那新年裏間斷的爆竹聲格外熱鬧。街道上除了風的踪跡外，一股新年的新氣象早已消散冷淸淸的，連一條狗的影子也不容易發現。</p>
<p>西北風更是一陣緊一陣。天上的烏雲，一片片的被風趕了攏來。地上的草樹……一切都被風打得在戰慄。總之，天地間充滿了肅殺的氣象，這是下雪前的兆微——村裏的農民盼望了好久。</p>
<p>明兒家裏每一角隅裏的暖氣，被風搜刮得一無所有。他家裏更沒有取暖的器具，祇靠了一些厚衣服來保持體溫，因此時時覺得寒氣刺面，打着寒顫。在平時總可以生一隻小火爐來調和調和外來的冷氣，不多一刻滿間屋子暖烘烘的，宛然是在春天。可是現在連一隻燒飯的風爐也是向人家借來的，那裏來的火爐呢？而且在這村子裏，就是有了火爐，也無處可以買到煤塊的。</p>
<p>一直挨到那天晚上，下雪前的景况，被風佈置得十分妥貼，雪便一片片的飄下來。在起先的時候，雪一下到地面上，那些已疲乏的生物都用出了熱力來抵抗，果然那雪花便流着淚而消化了。可是雪花繼續的壓到地面上，那些僅有微微一息的生物，掙扎到了只剩最後的一口氣，便被它們壓死了。雪便一片片的堆積起來。下了整整的一晚，便把道個世界的本來面目改造成另一番簇新的景象。</p>
<p>明兒一覺醒來，眼前頓時一亮。雪白的光從那白紙糊的窗中透射進來，分外的耀目。他便　溜烟的起了牀，便推開了窗，到處都是一片銀白色。</p>
<p>滿空白漫漫的，分不出那是山峯，這是岡巒；那是原野，這是叢林；辨不出天南地北；一切都是茫茫無際的，似乎身處在浩浩蕩蕩的洋海中。</p>
<p>在這一切都是白的環境中，把明兒沈悶的心境洗滌得一乾二凈，異常高興，穿了他的皮鞋，套了他的手套，玩雪去了。他剛走出門，被那鄰家三個大孩子的雪球拋在頸裏，他們笑得合不攏嘴。他又冷又羞，便想報仇，因此很快的準備好了不少又堅又硬的雪彈，一抵三的開戰起來，他奮不顧身的抵抗。那三個躲在他們堆成的矮雪人後面，作爲防禦物。他更勇敢地衝過去，一彈打去，打去了那雪人的頭。那三個好侵略的大孩子也鼠竄前去，無形中他是勝利了。</p>
<p>他渾身在發熱，精神又很愉快。從這次雪戰中他便得了個敎訓「冷不要怕，要奮鬥才得熱！恥不足羞，要奮鬥才可雪！」</p>

<p>天還沒有亮，忽聽得街頭有呻吟聲和低低的啜泣聲，我被他們的聲音所吵醒，便輕輕地爬起來，推開窗于去看，只見下面有二個黑黯黯的東西，一個睡在屋簷下呻吟，一個坐在水門汀上啜泣。</p>
<p>我便想「我們也是逃難的人，我們現在還有屋子住衣服穿，還不發些慈悲心，將來恐怕自己也要到這個地步的，唉！這兩年來，不知有多少小孩沒有了爹娘，不知有多少同胞被殘酷的砲火埋葬了，被炸彈炸得身首異處了，我們在這種環境裏，還能够讀書，亦可算是幸運的人兒哩……。」</p>
<p>「小姐，小姐，你在做什麽？」</p>
<p>原來天已透着魚肚白色了，李媽起來燒早飯了，伊見我一個人站在窗口邊發呆，便問我做什麽，而我的思想也被伊打斷了？</p>
<p>一會兒，天已大亮，李媽早飯也燒好了，我便呌伊盛了二碗粥，給二個可憐的凍餓了不知多少時候的難民吃，我看見他們餓極了的吃相，忍不住要笑出來，忽然受着良心的責備，「你要譏笑他們，你良心有嗎？」</p>
<p>於是我便一聲不響的拿着書包上學校去了。</p>

<p>— 哀黎</p>
<p>一會兒他們已到了一株大樹跟前，這樹的中段，便掛着一盞小燈，發着那明亮的藍光。內中有一個矮人開口說道：「到了到了，我們已到了村口了。」於是那些矮人們一齊爬上樹去，好像一窠蜜蜂般蜂擁着，上去了一些路，就一個個的不見了。阿麗什麼都瞧不見，只見那盞藍光的小燈。伊心中暗暗詫異，想他們難道就這樣拋下伊在這裏不成？驀然之間，却聽得了吶喊一聲，抬眼看時，見那兩個矮人立在一根樹枝上，正在放下一部繩梯來，一面招呼伊爬上去？阿麗毫不遲疑，很容易的爬上了繩梯，一級一級的爬到了那兩個矮人站着的所在，才瞧到了他們，剛才所以忽然不見的原因。原來這枝大樹的幹兒是空的，裏面一級一級的雕成了扶梯的模樣。當時矮人們就招呼伊走將下去。阿麗好奇心切，立刻從這梯級上一步步下去。可是梯級很狭小，使伊很難立足，幾乎跌了下去；幸而伊十分小心，除了滑了幾下之外，並沒有跌交。這梯子似乎很長，伊越是下去，越是黑暗，末後竟運一些兒光綫都沒有了；好在伊覺得已走完了這梯子，兩脚已踏到了平地，等了約有半分鐘光鱟，似乎瞧見一扇門開了，一片意想不到的美景，已展開在伊的眼前。</p>
<p>這是一個矮人村！一排一排的小屋子，沒有一座比阿麗的身子高的。可是給矮人們住在裏頭，已是很舒服的了。每一座屋子的前面，有一個小小的花圃，也種些小花小草，花兒開得爛爛漫漫，很是美麗。這時雖已入晚，却並不是一片漆黑，四下裏仍有一種柔和的光，彷彿是夏天的黄昏；而每一座小屋子的門前，又都掛着一盞藍色的燈，燈光在閃爍着，好像是都市商店中的霓虹燈招牌一般。在那一座座的小屋子前，都站着一對矮人夫婦，可是那些矮女人並不穿監衣，而穿着棕色的衣裙，所以反不及伊們丈夫那麽漂亮。矮人們一見阿麗走近，都深深的鞠躬，矮婦們也福了一福。阿麗不敢怠慢，一路還禮；伊心中明白，矮人們是特地邀伊來參觀他們的村子，而當伊像上客般招待的。伊慢慢走去，不住的東張西望，要滿足伊的好奇心。一陣陣凉爽的晚風，吹拂着伊的藍袍，袍角飄呀飄的，幾乎接觸着那些小屋子的屋頂。</p>

<h3 id="c137">千金之子“Golden　Boy” <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>「他是個音樂家，而不是拳擊手，請你好好地照顧他。」當佐意離家的時候，他的父親非常慘痛的對蘿娜這樣說。這慈祥的父親，他是多麽地愛惜他的愛子，希望他能够成功一個音樂家，一留意你的這雙手！」他時常向兒子警吿。然而佐意不能安於貧窮，他用他父親寄托着無限希望的這雙手去參加拳擊，博取巨款。當佐意的提琴不能奏出和諧的聲音時候，彭納派特還是鼓勵他奏啊！奏啊！兒子却給了他一點不留餘地的答覆，走了！</p>
<p>在黑暗里的兩小時，我深深地被這動人的故事感動了！「留意你的這雙手！」這警告是對徘徊在金錢和名譽的歧途上的每一個人說的。蔡如蘅的「從前所不愿意做的事，現在他祗得做了」就是誤用了他的那雙手！</p>
<p>威廉霍爾登本來是提琴家，他担任佐意這重要的角色，他給了我們滿意的成績。在老父的督促，金錢的誘惑，戀愛的懷疑三方面交織下的情感衝突，都能充份的發揮，最後被流氓福西里重重的打了耳光後的那個「特寫」，憤恨，痛苦，慚愧的交迫，他的深刻的表情，感人下淚。演他父親的賈可柏，他的精湛的演技，更帮助了「千金之子」的成功。如購買提琴爲兒子誕辰的禮物；警吿兒子留意他的手；他歌唱跳舞以激動佐意演奏提琴；到拳擊塲見佐意；及最後擁抱着佐意和蘿娜，骨肉之情的流露，無論動作，語調，都把握着這一角色的感情轉移。其他如白蓓蘭史丹妃的蘿娜，亞道夫孟郁的湯姆，喬斯斐克里亞的福西里，也都盡職。</p>
<p>導演墨穆林的驚人手腕，使本片始終在激盪，緊張的氣氛中進展。佐意的徬徨歧途，他用兩塲提琴演奏，緊接拳擊「復印」來加强他心理衝突，再見得有力量。最後一場拳擊拳擊場的空氣，使觀衆窒息着喘不過氣來。並且緊接着這高潮之後，他一鼓作氣地把佐意轉變過來，這是非有雄厚魄力的導演所不能奏功的。</p>
<p>總之，「千金之子」是一部劇本，演員，導演三美俱全的優美作品。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Bloody Battle Unfolds on the East and West Suburbs of Nanning; Chinese Army Positions in the West Suburbs Lost and Regained Eight Times; Japanese Army's Forced Crossing of the Yong River Suffers Heavy Casualties <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Guilin: A portion of the Japanese army on the southern front, after reaching Liangqingxu, Yudong, Tongqingxu, and other places on the morning of the 23rd, were met with a fierce counterattack by the Chinese army, suffering numerous casualties. By noon, Japanese artillery heavily bombarded the suburbs of the Chinese city to cover a forced crossing of the Yu River. Chinese soldiers bravely fought back, engaging the Japanese army in close combat, repeatedly contesting for several hours, eventually completely repelling the Japanese. Japanese corpses were left piled like mountains, and blood flowed in streams. The remaining Japanese troops fled in disarray to the south bank. Subsequently, three Japanese regiments successively reinforced, with large numbers of aircraft providing cover, launching forced crossings in multiple directions. Under enemy aerial bombardment, fierce battles unfolded on the east and west suburbs of Nanning. Although the Chinese troops defending the east suburbs suffered successive casualties, they remained steadfast, determined to perish with the enemy. The defensive positions of the troops defending the west suburbs were lost and regained eight times, demonstrating the extreme intensity of the battle, which cannot be fully described in words. The fierce fighting continued throughout the day, with both sides suffering extremely heavy casualties. As of noon on the 24th, confused fighting was still ongoing in the suburbs of Nanning. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to Chinese government officials here, Nanning is not only still in the hands of the Chinese army, but the Japanese troops in the suburbs have also suffered a disastrous defeat with heavy casualties. This morning, a long-distance phone call was made to the Southwest Headquarters in Guilin, confirming that Nanning is still being defended by the Chinese army. (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to a telegram received this morning from Chinese sources at the front line in Guangxi, the situation in Nanning is tense because the Chinese troops defending the area are threatened with encirclement by Japanese forces from the southeast and southwest. It is reported that the right flank of the Japanese army has reached Liangqing, southeast of Nanning, and the left flank has advanced to Tongqing, southwest of Nanning. At the same time, the main force of the Japanese army is currently advancing north along the Beihai-Nanning highway and has already approached Nanning from the south. Military figures here this morning neither confirmed nor denied the Japanese reports of the fall of Nanning. According to the general opinion here, since the area is already surrounded on three sides, its fall seems inevitable. However, news received this afternoon from the front line in Guangxi is very comforting, stating that fierce fighting is taking place near Gulao Mountain (transliteration), ten miles from Nanning. According to Chinese estimates, the combined strength of the Japanese forces from all directions is four regiments, or a division and a half, mainly cavalry and infantry, equipped with light mountain artillery. It is reported that the Japanese are attempting to bypass the main force of the Chinese army south of Nanning and then launch a surprise attack on Nanning. According to Chinese telegrams, Japanese troops have been blocked by the Chinese army near Gulao Mountain, and fierce fighting is currently underway. It is also reported that the Japanese have been contained on both banks of the You River, south of Nanning. The Chinese military authorities here not only expressed confidence that the Guangxi army would be able to stop the Japanese advance but also believed that the difficult terrain of Guangxi province would inflict great losses on the Japanese. Furthermore, there is another factor that will cause the Japanese to suffer significant losses, namely the difficulty the Japanese will have in maintaining communication with their rear. The fate of Nanning will be decided within 48 hours. (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Guilin: For the past two days, the sound of mortars and small cannons has been incessant day and night on the southern front. Japanese aircraft have also been bombing Nanning and its surrounding areas in shifts throughout the day. The intensity of the fighting near Nanning has reached its peak. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Guilin: The Japanese army that occupied Yudong sneaked to the south bank of the Yong River at one o'clock in the afternoon on the 22nd and engaged in a river crossing battle with the Chinese army. A portion of the Japanese army sneaked to the vicinity of Siyantang, southeast of Nanning, attempting a forced crossing under the cover of artillery. After fierce resistance from the Chinese, the fighting continued until the evening. Countless Japanese soldiers were killed or drowned. The remaining Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attack and fled back in disarray. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Liujiang: The Japanese army that sneaked to the north bank of the Yu River is currently engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese army. The Chinese troops defending the suburbs of Nanning are inflicting heavy blows on the invading Japanese army. Japanese artillery fire is exceptionally heavy, and Japanese aircraft are carrying out extensive bombing raids. Chinese officers and soldiers, determined to perish with the enemy, are engaging the Japanese in close combat, and a bloody battle is unfolding. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Guilin: It has been ten days since the outbreak of the war on the southern front. In the area between the Yangshan Mountains and the Shiwan Mountains, although a portion of the Japanese army has ventured to advance, the fact is that the further the Japanese army advances from the coast, the deeper their difficulties become. All measures taken by the Chinese on the southwestern defense line are based on two principles: avoiding point-and-line contests in coastal areas, first; and using favorable space and time to strike at the main force of the Japanese army, second. At present, thanks to the thorough implementation of the "scorched earth" policy, the Chinese side has already achieved considerable success in the overall strategy. Not only have they suppressed the Japanese, forcing them to abandon the use of heavy weapons, but even their food supply relies on airplanes, as there are no materials available for them to use wherever the Japanese army goes. In the past, the Japanese were able to forcibly use Chinese manpower and animal power in various battlefields to transport supplies or build roads, but now this is absolutely impossible, and the Japanese have to do it themselves. What is even more unexpected for the Japanese is that they are constantly subject to armed attacks by the Chinese people. Based on this phenomenon, the Japanese have already sown the seeds of their defeat. The current war is still in a certain stage of the Chinese plan. In another stage, the war situation will have a new development and give the Japanese a fatal blow. (Dispatch of the 24th)</p>

The remaining Japanese fled south, and the Chinese followed in pursuit, reaching the vicinity of Dachigang (north of Sanshui) near dusk and encountering the Japanese reserve forces again, resulting in a fierce battle. The situation is still deadlocked in the area. In this Japanese invasion of Lubao, the Chinese army and people bravely resisted, capturing many enemy soldiers.

<h3 id="e8">Frequent Movements of Japanese Troops in Chaozhou and Shantou <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Fengshun: Japanese troops in Chaozhou and Shantou have been frequently moving recently. All defense areas have been taken over by puppet troops. Even the strategic passes of Chaoan, Chenghai, and Dahao (under the jurisdiction of Chaoyang) are garrisoned by puppet troops. The total number of Japanese troops stationed in Chaozhou and Shantou does not exceed 1,500. Recently, puppet troops have been frequently defecting. However, due to the thin strength of the Japanese army, they can only exercise passive control, assigning 10 to 15 Japanese soldiers to every 100 puppet troops to monitor them. The Japanese and puppet troops are mutually suspicious, and the morale of the military is increasingly uneasy. (Dispatch of the 24th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: Since the Sixth Plenary Session, the issue of how to adjust the structure and improve administrative efficiency has attracted considerable attention. A Central News Agency reporter inquired about this matter from a responsible source in the central government on the 25th. According to the source, the plenary session discussed the outline for adjusting the party, government, and military administrative structure and entrusted it to the Central Standing Committee for planning and implementation. The Central Standing Committee will discuss and decide on this matter next week. As for the candidates for various ministries and commissions, there will be no major changes in general. The central government is focused on improving administrative efficiency and continuing to promote established programs to adapt to the needs of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction.

<h3 id="e10">The Battle Situation in Nanning and the Spirit of Guangxi <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of the 15th of this month, the Japanese army landed near Beihai. Although the Japanese navy spokesman claimed that the landing target was to seize the port of Beihai, the fact is that the landing operation was concentrated in the area of Qinxian and Fangcheng, and after landing, they were even more determined to advance lightly, and the war quickly spread to the border between Guangxi and Guangdong. It can be seen that the goal of the Japanese army's attack is Nanning (Yongning). Originally, the coastal area of Qinlian belonged to Guangdong Province politically. However, economically and in terms of transportation, it has a closer relationship with Guangxi. Nanning is connected to Vietnam on the left and Qinlian on the right. Therefore, the port of Beihai is the gateway to Nanning. If the Japanese army captures Nanning, its value will be higher than that of Beihai.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of the Japanese army's launching of this war? If it is said to cut off the sea route to the southwest through Guangdong Province, then the port of Beihai, although it was prosperous for a while a few months ago, has long been regarded by the Chinese side as a symbolic sacrifice since the Japanese army on Saizhou Island increased its threat and has not been taken seriously at all. If it is said to occupy the Longyong Highway and cut off the transportation between "Free China" and Annam, one fact is that the transportation between Guangxi and Vietnam is not as important as that between Yunnan and Vietnam; and the transportation between Guangxi and Vietnam is not limited to the Longyong Highway. According to news from Chongqing, there is already another short and convenient route available for traffic between Lang Son in Annam and Chongqing. It can be seen that even if the Longyong Highway is cut off, what damage will it do to China? - Moreover, before the Japanese army went to cut it off, the military and civilians of Guangxi Province had already destroyed the highway. If it is said that the Japanese army's deployment of troops in Guangxi is intended to threaten Annam and demonstrate to France, just like the intention of attacking Hainan Island this spring, this point is the most reasonable. This newspaper has already discussed it in detail a week ago, so I will not repeat it here. As for saying that the Japanese army's actions are only to stimulate the morale of their own people as a cover for the disastrous defeat in northern Hunan; or to make a move like playing chess as a kind of arrangement for attacking the southwest, although these are not the main roles, they may also be one of the roles. In short, the Japanese army does not seem to have considered its own final fate, so it is complacent to launch a war in one more place; this is like a gambler who is constantly hitting walls and is happy to find another place to make a desperate bet, but he never thinks about how risky this move is!</p>
<p>At present, a bloody battle has already broken out in the southern suburbs of Nanning, and the situation seems very critical; but the south of Nanning has the natural danger of the Yu River (also known as the Yong River), and the Japanese army must pay a very heavy price to fly over it. Moreover, we still remember Changsha before February, which had already reached the dangerous situation of being under siege, but before long, the Japanese army collapsed across the board and fled in panic; using that as an example, then the success or failure of the Japanese army's war in Guangxi is still unknown!</p>
<p>Even if the Japanese army can occupy Nanning, comparing Nanning to Changsha, the relationship between gain and loss is definitely not that important; comparing Guangxi to Hunan, Nanning does not have the strategic importance of Yueyang. The Japanese army has occupied Yueyang for a year, and they still cannot advance an inch. They have repeatedly tried to advance, but they have suffered an unprecedented disastrous defeat; then, in the same way, even if they capture Nanning, what will it hinder the overall situation in Guangxi? What will it hinder the overall situation in the southwest? There is also a more important point, that is, the Japanese army occupying a corner of Guangxi is actually more dangerous than occupying a corner of Hunan, because the spirit of Guangxi in the new China is as strong as the spirit of Hunan, and the organization of the people of Guangxi has more history and a more solid foundation than that of Hunan; in other words, the Japanese army stepping into Guangxi will inevitably be doomed to failure sooner.</p>
<p>Guangxi Province is located in a remote border area, with barren land, and mixed with Miao and Yao people, who are often tempered; therefore, the folk customs are strong, and they have played a unique spirit in the modern history of China; such as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, such as the National Revolution, have already made great achievements and are recorded in history. In the last ten years, Guangxi, under the careful construction of the local wise men, has indeed made a leap in material aspects, and has made great achievements in spiritual aspects. They take "Building Guangxi to Revive China" as their slogan, so all facilities are based on national needs as a prerequisite, not only popularizing mass education, but also universally developing mass organizations. The mass organizations of Guangxi Province not only pay attention to autonomy, but also pay more attention to self-defense, and as a result, not only do the military and civilians cooperate, but the military and civilians are also integrated. In this war of resistance, the able-bodied children of Guangxi Province have fought in various parts of the north and south and have made outstanding achievements. For example, they have participated in the defense battles of Shanghai and Wuhan. In particular, the great victory of Taierzhuang was almost the unique achievement of the Guangxi army. Now that the Japanese army has directly invaded Guangxi, this is an excellent opportunity for the military and civilians of Guangxi to work together to protect their homes and promote national spirit. Last time in the great victory in northern Hunan, General Bai Chongxi had already pointed out that this was the effect of military-civilian cooperation; moreover, now that he has arrived in Guangxi, which he built with his own hands, he will certainly be able to exert a greater role. It is said that at this moment, Guangxi Province, because of the Japanese army's invasion, has mobilized the entire province's population, and is working hard on positive work such as demolishing roads and moving grain, as well as active self-defense preparations; it can be seen that even if the Japanese army obtains an inch of land in Guangxi Province, it is nothing more than rubble; if they try to go deeper, they will only be digging their own graves! This is not a curse, this is a rational argument.</p>

<p>Tokyo: Today, all Japanese newspapers reported in a special position the situation of British Ambassador Craigie's talks with Japanese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Kaku Masao for 90 minutes yesterday. It is said that the result of the talks was no real compromise. During the talks, the British Ambassador (1) expressed the British government's views on the sinking of the Zhao Guo Maru, (2) formally protested the shooting down of the British Imperial Airways plane on Saizhou Island on the 8th of this month, and (3) raised the issue of the Chinese deposits in Tianjin. According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, this meeting only showed the differences in Anglo-Japanese views. Craigie is still holding a tough attitude at a time when Japanese-American and Japanese-Soviet relations have not been determined, which is different from the intentions of his own government. According to the Miyako Shimbun, Craigie suggested handing over the deposits in the British concession in Tianjin in exchange for the lifting of the blockade. Kaku Masao told him that the blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin was a military necessity to maintain peace and security. Although this issue and the issue of deposits can be resolved at the same time with different concepts, they should be handled separately. The Japanese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs refused to accept the protest regarding the British Imperial Airways plane incident, saying that according to the Arida-Craigie Agreement, the United Kingdom has recognized the existence of a state of war in China.

Shiratori Toshio claimed that the United Kingdom and the United States are both making efforts to prevent Soviet-Japanese cooperation. Therefore, Japan should decide whether the Soviet Union will participate in the establishment of a new world order. According to Shiratori, the Soviet Union has now expressed its willingness to stop supporting General Chiang Kai-shek. (Haitong dispatch of the 25th)</p>

<p>Hamburg: At a meeting of the Far East Association of Hamburg and Bremen, Dr. Leissner, Chairman of the Association, gave a speech stating that Britain's position in the Far East is weaker than it was during the World War, while Germany's position is tending to strengthen. He believes that land traffic to Japan and "Manchukuo" is becoming increasingly important. According to Dr. Leissner, the Far East Association has obtained permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Foreign Affairs Office of the National Socialist Party to rescue German expatriates detained in Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

<h3 id="e15">London Times: A Detailed Discussion of the Far Eastern Situation; Japanese Military Victory is Now Impossible; Soviet-Japanese Negotiations Will Be Difficult to Achieve Significant Results <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>London: The Times reports that although the European crisis is extremely serious, the drama unfolding in the Far East cannot be ignored. Japanese troops are still deeply mired in the Chinese quagmire, and their autumn offensive has clearly failed. The Chinese regular army still exists, and the loss of Beihai seems to have had little impact. The morale of the Japanese army has indeed been undermined by guerrilla tactics and the boredom of a prolonged and endless war. The Japanese government and military leaders know that military victory is impossible, and are now devoting themselves to political movements, hoping to achieve politically what they cannot achieve by force. It is highly doubtful whether Wang Jingwei has the ability to satisfy those who support him from behind. Currently, no puppet regime seems capable of surviving for more than a few weeks after the departure of the Japanese army. A Chinese national movement backed by the Japanese army is not inspiring. Even if the Japanese have made the fish swallow the bait, they have not yet caught it. The regime and independence demanded by the bait-swallower are not what the bait-layer is willing to give. The bait-swallower is now likely regretting the recklessness of swallowing the bait and is thinking of ways to escape the net. The Times also commented on the start of Soviet-Japanese trade negotiations, saying, what reward will Japan give for the Soviet Union abandoning its political and commercial interests in China? This is truly unknowable. Even if the Soviet Union complies, there are still other countries that are unwilling to disappear from the Far East. The U.S. government has clearly stated its abolition of trade with Japan, as a response to Japan's violation of the Nine-Power Treaty and repeated infringements on American interests in China. The economic conflict between the U.S. and Japan will have a disastrous impact on Japanese finances. Even if Japan wants to safeguard its commercial relations with the U.S., it may be too late. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>London: A dispatch from the Times correspondent in Tokyo, commenting on the news that Japan and the Soviet Union will hold negotiations in the near future, stated: "Each country has interests in both China and Eastern Europe. They have now parted ways geographically and decided to first resolve key issues, and then consider the situation and discuss major questions. Japan wants the Soviet Union to abandon its political and commercial interests in China. It is unknown what kind of exchange conditions can be used as compensation. Regarding this, even if the Soviet Union reaches a compromise with Japan, other countries may not withdraw from the Far East." (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>Manila: Admiral Hepburn, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, arrived here today aboard his flagship "Augusta" with U.S. Consul General to Shanghai Gauss. When reporters asked about U.S.-Japan relations in the Far East, Admiral Hepburn replied that U.S.-Japan relations are generally satisfactory, and although there are minor annoyances, none are serious. The only thing that exceeds the level of unpleasantness is the situation in Tianjin. However, Admiral Hepburn only mentioned the various difficulties shared by Americans and others, such as the lack of anthracite coal and the obstruction of food shipments passing through the concession. Although Admiral Hepburn showed the pass he obtained when visiting Tianjin, he said that he had not actually used it once. According to Admiral Hepburn, he has wanted to come to the Philippines for some time. He now intends to be a guest of Rear Admiral Spruance, the 16th Naval District Commandant, and hopes to meet with U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre, but denies any political significance. According to Admiral Hepburn, a very tragic situation will inevitably occur in North China due to this year's floods and severe food shortages. Hepburn also intends to visit the U.S. Army installations in the Philippines, but it is not clear when Admiral Hepburn will depart by ship. (United Press dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Manila: Although Admiral Hepburn, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, denies any political significance to his visit, local newspapers believe it has important implications. According to the Philippine Herald, "The final victory of the U.S. Far Eastern policy may be achieved through the meeting of Sayre, Hepburn, and Gauss." (United Press dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>Swiss Capital, Basel: The Basler Nachrichten recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that the German government authorities believe that mine warfare is sufficient to strike at Britain and also make a deep impression on various neutral countries, and is indeed a "new stage of the current war." However, there is still much criticism of the attitude of various neutral countries. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Paris: "Le Petit Parisien" reporter Maurice stated today that it is now permissible to announce that the British Admiralty has now devised a way to soon stop German mines, whether they are magnetic mines or not, they will be brought to the surface and destroyed. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>London: Another large British merchant ship, the "Mongala" (8,886 tons), was also sunk by a mine off the east coast of London. The ship was anchored when it struck the mine. All seventy-seven crew members were rescued. A convoy of British merchant ships arrived safely in the Thames River last night under the escort of warships. The horrific weapon that Hitler previously claimed Germany could use to attack its enemies but that its enemies could not use to attack Germany definitely refers to these parachute-dropped mines. According to official sources, this type of weapon is one of the most horrific and completely contrary to the principles of civilized warfare. Germany is resorting to this mine warfare because submarine warfare has been unsuccessful. The German public has become increasingly dissatisfied with the results of submarines. The German side has had to use its technical intelligence to create this ingenious weapon. However, it treats the warships and merchant ships of belligerent and neutral countries the same, without any distinction. Even hospital ships are not exempt. The mines laid by the German side are clearly of two types: one is the old-style tethered mine, and the other is a newly invented, very powerful mine with special sensitivity. The latter is Hitler's secret weapon. The British side does not yet seem to be able to determine its nature and counter its effectiveness. However, after some time, Britain will eventually devise a way to deal with this. There have been at least three occasions when German aircraft have been seen laying mines. The location was at the mouth of the Thames River, and the time was at night. The rumor that navigation is now prohibited at the mouth of the Thames River is completely untrue. It is heard that mines washed ashore have been found on the coast of Berkshire. These are the old-style mines, as the German side is scattering old-style mines outside territorial waters to confuse people.</p>
<p>Germany has not yet declared a mined area. This is also a violation of the Hague Convention. Currently, maritime fishermen are performing the task of clearing shipping lanes. According to sources here, the British government's decision to confiscate German exports in retaliation for Germany's illegal destruction of merchant ships is not contrary to recognized principles of international law. The greatest inconvenience suffered by neutral countries due to British actions is delay, but this delay is now gradually being reduced to a minimum. The losses suffered by Britain and neutral countries due to Germany's indiscriminate laying of drifting mines and the illegal shelling by German submarines are not only in material terms, but also endanger the lives of women and children. The greatest purpose of international law is to protect the rights of neutral countries. Compare the past records of the attitudes of the British and German governments towards international law and the rights of neutral countries, and there can be no doubt as to which side will win, and which side is for the protection of public law and neutrality. Therefore, for the sake of international law itself, it is necessary to create new precedents for dealing with this new type of piracy. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>London: After the British 1,335-ton destroyer "Gipsy" was mined on November 22, the Admiralty has now announced that the number of casualties included three officers and ten sailors injured, twenty-nine missing, presumed drowned, and one sailor died of his injuries. Thanks to the alertness of the captain, the ship was run aground, avoiding total destruction. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>London: The Admiralty announced that the new British 10,000-ton cruiser "Belfast" was damaged by a mine or torpedo in the waters near the Isle of May in the Firth of Forth, Scotland, on the 21st of this month and is now under repair. Twenty crew members were injured. After the ship was hit, other ships sped to its aid. Passengers on trains saw the ship returning to port. Five of the injured crew members had head injuries and nerve shock and have been hospitalized, none of which are serious. The remaining injured are all being treated at a naval hospital. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Note: The "Belfast" began construction in 1936 and was launched in March 1938. The naming ceremony was performed by the Prime Minister's wife, Mrs. Chamberlain. After completion, it was assigned to the Home Fleet, equipped with twelve 6-inch caliber guns, twelve 4-inch caliber anti-aircraft guns, six torpedo tubes, and carried three aircraft. The hull armor is thick and strong, capable of withstanding 8-inch caliber shells. (Havas)</p>

<p>London: According to responsible sources, more than 200 mines laid by Germany off the coast of Yorkshire have been washed ashore today.

Now, hearing the news that the Dutch oil tanker "Slite Tillet" has also been sunk by a torpedo, they are greatly angered. Although the newspapers still maintain a completely neutral attitude, passersby all know that the responsibility lies with the German side. A certain Dutchman told the reporter that the Germans cannot deny it this time, as there are survivors who can testify. It is expected that the Dutch government will demand compensation from Germany.

<p>London: After the British government decided to blockade German export trade, the Belgian and Dutch ambassadors to Britain have all presented notes. Italian Ambassador Bastoniani also explained the views of his government to the Foreign Office in writing. Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Mamoru also went to the Foreign Office to make similar representations. As is generally known, the British government will issue an order within days, or even today, the 28th, to implement the blockade policy and will not hesitate due to the representations of Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, and Japan. However, the interests of various neutral countries will still be taken into account. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>London: The British government's decision to blockade German export trade has elicited protests from both Italy and Japan. Political figures here do not see this as strange, but say that Germany is to blame for its influence. The British plan is merely to detain goods, which is incomparable to the German piracy that threatens lives and the safety of ships, and does not even consider which country the ships belong to. On the other hand, British officials also stated that the British and French governments had suggested setting up a safe zone for women and children, similar to the South City of Shanghai and the example of Hankou, so as not to suffer from the ravages of war, but this was rejected by Germany. Its disregard for humanity is another clear proof. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese government authorities believe that Britain's decision to detain all German goods on the high seas and Chamberlain's statement on the 21st that an imperial ordinance would be promulgated to this effect violate international law, and that this action contradicts the 1856 Paris Declaration (Declaration Defining the Essentials of Maritime Law). According to Article 2 of the Declaration, goods loaded on neutral ships, except for contraband of war, shall not be detained. Britain, France, and Japan are all signatories to this Declaration. The Japanese government regards this act by the British government as trampling on international treaties and infringing on the sovereignty of neutral countries, and has today instructed Ambassador Shigemitsu to Britain to lodge a protest with the British government. (Domei dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese Foreign Ministry protested against the British government's suppression of German exports. At the same time, the Information Minister issued a statement elaborating the Japanese government's position, the content of which is as follows: Since the outbreak of the European war, the British government has limited the scope of belligerent rights and, with regard to contraband of war and its goods, has hindered legitimate Japanese trade. Therefore, the Japanese government and the governments of the Netherlands, Belgium, and the Scandinavian countries have repeatedly lodged protests with the British government. However, on the 21st, British Prime Minister Chamberlain determined that the cause of the recent frequent sinking of ships of neutral countries near the British coast was due to German actions, and declared that he would prevent ships of neutral countries from exporting German goods. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that the cause of the sinking of ships of neutral countries was due to German actions, but this action by the British government still goes beyond the scope of retaliation stipulated by international law, and violates the words of the British government's previous statement to Japan that "Britain has never interfered with neutral countries shipping German goods." And because of this action by the British government, not only Germany will suffer losses, but various neutral countries will suffer even greater losses. Currently, as the British government's imperial ordinance regarding this matter has not yet been issued, it is not known to what extent the export of German goods will be prohibited. However, there is little doubt that important Japanese imports will be prevented from entering the country. The Japanese government cannot tolerate such a method by the British government. Therefore, on the 24th, Ambassador Shigemitsu in Britain was instructed to lodge a serious protest with the British government. If Japan's important interests suffer losses as a result, then Japan will have no choice but to take countermeasures. (Domei dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>Cernauti, Romania: Since Soviet troops entered Poland on September 17 of this year, telegraphic communication between eastern Poland (i.e., the currently Soviet-occupied area) and Romania was severed until it was restored on the 18th of this month. At that time, according to official announcements, representatives from Germany, the Soviet Union, and Romania were to hold a meeting in Oraseni, Romania, to discuss the issue of Romanian goods being transported to Germany through the Soviet-occupied area. Due to differences of opinion between Germany and the Soviet Union regarding the operation of the railway from Oraseni through Lviv, Poland, to Breslau, Germany, the meeting was postponed. The telegraphic communication between Romania and eastern Poland was also cut off again last night. As a result, people generally believe that there is no certainty of success in the trilateral talks between Germany, the Soviet Union, and Romania to discuss the issue of Romanian goods in transit. Before September of this year, most of the Romanian goods transported to Germany took the aforementioned railway route. After Soviet troops entered eastern Poland, they blockaded the border between the two countries, and Romanian goods were unable to continue to be transported to Germany by land. Although the German side put forward various arguments and requested the Soviet Union to restore railway traffic, all were ineffective. It can be seen that the German National Socialist Party's plan to obtain new markets in Southeastern Europe has been hindered by the Soviet Union's obstruction. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>London: The Information Department has issued a communiqué stating that the number of German acts violating international law was already countless.

It is known that according to this convention, belligerent countries may not force enemy prisoners of war to fight against their own country. Germany has almost forgotten that it is one of the signatories to this convention. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>Paris: A semi-official dispatch from the French side of the German border states that Germany, according to a plan proposed by Hitler, had originally planned to invade the Netherlands on November 12. After the Munich bomb case, Hitler held a secret meeting of the general staff. General Leeb was originally a supporter of Hitler's plan to invade the Netherlands. During the discussion, he asked Hitler to pay attention to the important news of King Leopold of Belgium's visit to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. According to this news, if Germany invades the Netherlands, Belgium will support the Netherlands. Hearing this, Hitler was unmoved and ordered General Leeb to complete the preparations for the attack on the Netherlands on the evening of November 11. On the morning of Armistice Day (i.e., November 11), Hitler and the generals continued to hold a meeting, and the atmosphere was very tense. General Leeb stated that all calculations were based on Belgium maintaining neutrality. If Belgium does not maintain neutrality, then Germany will fall into failure, and the current regime will inevitably collapse. He is prepared to follow the order to proceed, but if the calculation is wrong, then he will definitely commit suicide in front of the army to apologize to the people. At this point, German Commander-in-Chief von Brauchitsch rose up and spoke, saying that he did not want to bear the responsibility for this plan. None of the soldiers present could agree with the attack on the Netherlands. At this point in the discussion, Hitler cancelled the order to attack the Netherlands, only four hours before the time limit for the army to move out. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>The Hague: Prime Minister Gerbrandy recently announced the foreign policy in the Senate, stating: "The position of our country should be called the maintenance of independence rather than conservative neutrality, because the word neutrality has a negative and passive nature.

<p>Paris: The British and French air forces shot down as many as fourteen German planes in the past two days. However, according to a message issued by the German side yesterday, only one of their planes failed to return to base. The French Air Force Headquarters therefore issued a communique today, detailing the locations where enemy planes crashed, in order to expose German false propaganda. It is claimed that on the 22nd of this month, our side shot down a total of six enemy planes. Except for one that fell near Doran City in Belgium, five all fell within French territory. After investigation, they were Messerschmitts. One fell in Metz, one near Haguenau, and the pilots died on the spot. The remaining three fell in La Bouterange, Strasbourg, and Wissembourg, and their pilots were captured. On the 23rd of this month, the British and French air forces shot down eight enemy planes, seven of which were Dorniers, falling in Metz, Besançon, Angerville, Verdun, Thionville, Châlons, and Saint-Mihiel. All enemy pilots were killed, with only two captured. Another was a Heinkel, which crashed near Boulay, and the entire plane was burned, with no survivors. A total of fourteen German planes were shot down in two days. (Havas News Agency, 24th)</p>

<p>Tokyo: The sinking of the Japanese ship "Zhaoguo Maru" has caused a great shock to the Japanese people. Foreign Minister Nomura convened a meeting last night with Masayuki Tani, director of the European and Asian Affairs Bureau, Haruhiko Nishi, and other relevant leaders to discuss the attitude the Japanese government should take. As a result, it was decided to resolve this issue through diplomatic channels, and to study three possible scenarios: (1) when Britain should be held responsible; (2) when Germany is determined to be responsible; and (3) when the attribution of responsibility is unclear. In the first two cases, the responsible country will be required to pay compensation. When the responsible country is unclear, attention will be drawn to the belligerent countries to protect the commerce of neutral countries, and to ensure future safety. If the belligerent countries do not show sincerity towards Japan's attitude, then effective measures for the second step will be implemented. (Domei News Agency, 25th)</p>

<p>Romanian Capital City: When Prime Minister Tatarescu led the new cabinet members to be sworn in before King Carol II yesterday, he said in his speech that the members of the new cabinet are all members of the National Renaissance Front Party, and they will promote policies of appeasement and construction in all aspects to consolidate the foundation of the country. They will also gather all military and material forces in the country to defend neutrality and preserve the legacy of their ancestors in any situation.

The duty of all citizens is to sacrifice everything for the prosperity of the country." (Havas News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Romanian Capital: A Chinese observer recently commented on the formation of the new Romanian cabinet, saying that Tatarescu's transfer from ambassador to France to prime minister indicates that the new government has a pro-French leaning. However, Minister of Transport Gigurtu and Minister of Economy Angelescu are both figures who advocate German-Romanian friendship, and Foreign Minister Gafencu has also been reappointed, indicating that the current government will continue to pursue a neutral policy. Regarding this matter, well-informed sources pointed out that Gafencu and Tatarescu had disagreements in the past, and it remains to be seen whether they can cooperate seamlessly in the future.

<h3 id="e33">German Official Announcement: Details of Cracking British Spy Network; Strasser Orchestrated Various Conspiracies; Munich Bombing Also Masterminded by Him <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Berlin: The authorities here issued a statement tonight, describing the process of capturing the main culprit in the Munich bombing case, stating that Strasser hired Dupkin and Klemin in May 1938 to assassinate Führer Hitler, but was unsuccessful and the assassins were arrested. British intelligence then hired Elser to carry out this organized act of violence. After the Munich bombing on the 8th of this month, the national police received orders at 9:43 pm to strictly apprehend the perpetrators, closing the borders and strengthening the guarding of the open sections. The leader of the German Stormtroopers also dispatched a special committee to the scene of the incident in Munich that night. The police chief and the secret police chief established a central agency in Berlin to review reports from all over the country and maintain contact with the committee in Munich. On the night of the 8th, 120 people were arrested at various borders. Customs officers Li Gan and Zittler in the Constance area caught sight of a figure 15 meters away, near the Swiss border fence. When they inquired about his whereabouts, he said that he intended to visit Vochell Hubel. The customs officers then took the person to the police station. The transit passport proved that he was Elser, and fifteen documents were seized, including information on various ammunition depots, ammunition factories, ammunition transportation, and a diagram of the Munich beer cellar. Elser, like others arrested at the border, was sent to Munich and handed over to the special committee on the 9th. At that time, the committee had begun investigating and found that the explosives had been placed in the pillars in advance. Fragments of the bomb were found in the rubble. At noon on the 9th, it was confirmed that the cause of the explosion was a bomb equipped with a timer, and it was proven that the bomb was equipped with two clocks. Several people reported that they had recently seen a suspicious person lingering in the beer cellar. Elser denied any involvement in the bombing, saying that his motive for fleeing Germany was to avoid obligations to his illegitimate child, and that he planned to study technical skills abroad. At that time, the company that sold the clocks proved that the appearance of the buyer was the same as Elser. On the 14th, the beer cellar staff testified that they had seen Elser in the beer cellar in August, and that Elser had asked the beer cellar steward for a job in the spring, offering 50 marks as a reward. Elser was unable to defend himself, and on the 15th, he submitted a written confession, and on the 16th and 17th, he submitted drawings of the bomb equipped with a timer and the machinery used. The mastermind of the case was Strasser, who was waiting for his agent in Switzerland and has now fled to London. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Capital of Switzerland: Regarding the bombing in Munich, Germany, the National Public Opinion Newspaper of that country recently published an article, stating that when the police arrested the main culprit Elser, they searched his person and found various documents, especially a sketch of the Munich beer hall, which showed his involvement in the case. Later, the police searched the residence of his sister in Stuttgart and found a wooden box containing a complete set of clockwork parts, many of which were the same as those found in the Munich beer hall, as well as various tools with traces of cement on them. After testing by the authorities, it was proven that this cement was the same as that peeled off the pillars of the beer hall. Elser himself still refused to admit it until yesterday. Then the authorities summoned the beer hall staff to confront him, and he finally confessed everything and explained in detail how he placed the bomb in the pillars of the beer hall. (Havas News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The official communique issued last night proved that Strasser had participated in various conspiracies within Germany. The communique stated that Dupkin, a 40-year-old hotel steward, and Klemin, a 32-year-old clerk, were sentenced to death by the People's Court on September 21 for treason related to explosives law. According to the presiding judge, Dupkin fled Germany to Czechoslovakia in May 1936, and Klemin also fled in July. They were both guilty of robbery and fled to escape punishment. They contacted Strasser in Prague and then worked for Strasser's office. After the failure of the first bombing in 1936, the Jew Hersh was arrested and executed on March 8, 1937. Strasser then sent Dupkin and Klemin to carry out bombing operations in 1937. The first target was the Nuremberg National Socialist Party Congress, but the time was too short to implement the plan. Strasser then ordered them to find a way to carry out a bombing operation during Mussolini's visit to Berlin from September 15 to 29, 1937. If this plan could not be realized, then they would try to bomb the Thanksgiving Festival on October 3. Dupkin and Klemin sent someone to transport explosives to Germany on September 16, storing them in the luggage rooms of the Leipzig and Dresden train stations. Fortunately, they were discovered by the German secret police, who confiscated the explosives and arrested Dupkin and Klemin. (Haitong News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>London: The Times today received a dispatch from Rotterdam stating that two Englishmen, Captain Stevens, a passport officer, and Mr. Pettit, were kidnapped into German territory by Germans on November 9. It stated that the German peace proposals studied by Stevens and Pettit at the time of the kidnapping were based on maintaining the German regime under Hitler's current leadership. Therefore, the current German claim that these two Englishmen were colluding with German revolutionaries is completely inconsistent with the facts. The Germans now also claim that Captain Stevens' confession coincides with the statement by Propaganda Minister Goebbels that between November 1937 and November 1938, fifteen explosions occurred involving sabotage of merchant ships from Germany, Italy, and Japan. Goebbels' propaganda aims to create a favorable atmosphere for restoring close relations with Italy and Japan, because Italy and Japan, in view of Germany's sudden friendliness towards the Soviet Union, no longer trust Nazism.

<p>Washington: President Roosevelt made a statement yesterday, expressing his hope that the European war could end in the spring of next year. This statement is sufficient to express the optimistic psychology of US officials and most observers. Although President Roosevelt did not specify what kind of peace he expected, judging from various signs, it is also in line with the war goals of the British and French allies. Once the British and French allies have won a victory, or internal turmoil occurs in Germany, and the National Socialist system that specializes in violent conquest is overthrown, this goal can be achieved. As for the war situation, although Germany has stepped up its submarine war and indiscriminately laid mines along the British coast, US observers believe that it will have little effect. In addition, Germany's economic situation is difficult to sustain, so it is not a problem for France and France to win. Judging from the fact that the German military authorities have not yet been able to effectively formulate an offensive plan, it can also be seen that the government's views and the army's opinions have not been fully integrated. (Havas News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull strongly refuted the recent attacks by Congress on the government's reciprocal trade procedures at a press conference today. When a reporter asked whether the US trade agreement should be terminated when it expires in June next year, Hull replied that trade agreements are the cornerstone of world peace. The US trade program aims to increase domestic employment and adapt to an extreme economic situation, but many people misunderstand this basic point. Regarding the continuation of the expired trade agreement, he will, as usual, consult with congressional leaders before announcing his position. Observers believe that from Hull's remarks, the authorities are maintaining their trade program as the basis for lasting peace when the European war ends. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Warm Springs, Georgia: President Roosevelt discussed national expenditures with newspaper reporters today, saying that he hoped the European war could end next spring.

In the next fiscal year, defense expenditures will increase by 500 million yuan and exceed 20 billion yuan, or even reach 23 billion yuan. The authorities are considering levying a special tax to raise funds. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<p>Ottawa: Canadian Federal Treasurer Dunning recently gave a broadcast speech, explaining the contents of the next fiscal year's budget, which is also the first wartime budget, totaling $315,000,000, an increase of 50% compared to the budgets for the two fiscal years of 1916 and 1917 during the last European war. Since the establishment of the Wartime Purchasing Committee on September 1 of this year, it has ordered various supplies from Britain for 15,000,000 yuan, various military uniforms for 9,000,000 yuan, and planes from the United States for 10,000,000 yuan. In addition, Australian Federal Aviation Minister Fairbairn is here, consulting with representatives from Canada, New Zealand, and the South African Commonwealth on the establishment of a British Imperial Aircrew Training Center in the Canadian Commonwealth. Fairbairn told reporters that the Australian Federal budget for the next fiscal year will be around 240,000,000 yuan, an increase of four times compared to the first wartime budget during the last European war. As for the strength of the army, there are currently six divisions of elite soldiers. (Havas News Agency, 25th)</p>

In October, the National Government issued an order appointing him as a member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. In the early part of that month, Ant returned to Siam. Just as the country was celebrating the constitutional anniversary, Ant presented a heavy machine gun to the Siamese government, and the Siamese authorities expressed their gratitude and declared their goodwill towards the overseas Chinese.

The Guangzhou Japanese Broadcasting Station also broadcast on October 25 that the Siamese court had ordered Ant to be deported for one year on the 23rd, with the charge of resisting Japan.

<h3 id="e48">Commendation Requested from Hunan Province for Martyred Students <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Leiyang: In this recent war in northern Hunan, the loyal and heroic deeds of the Chinese people, wherever the Japanese troops went, are worthy of being recorded alongside the sacrifices of soldiers who died in the resistance against Japan for all time. It has been found that Wang Bangzuo, Yu Jie, Rao Bingzhang, Wu Jungu, and Wu Xuecheng, five students from the Jingzhushan Agricultural School in Fulimpu, were all captured by the Japanese army and died resisting. This is also where the righteousness of the Chinese nation lies. Their deeds are recorded as follows: Wang Bangzuo, age eighteen, was on autumn break when the Japanese army arrived. Unable to escape, he hastily wielded a hoe to stab at the enemy but missed. He was pursued by the Japanese army and threw himself into a well and died. Yu Jie, age seventeen, was captured by the Japanese army and killed for refusing to lead the way. Rao and Wu, both sixteen years old, and Wu Xuecheng, age fourteen, were all captured by the Japanese and forced to act as guides. All refused, and the Japanese army beat and insulted them. All three students cursed without ceasing. Wu and Wu were stabbed to death multiple times. Rao had his tongue cut out by the Japanese army and was stabbed to death. The provincial government believes that these five students were all young but were able to remain unyielding in the face of danger and acted with great righteousness, making them worthy of commendation. They have been praised and a request has been submitted to the National Government for bereavement compensation to comfort their loyal souls. (25th dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e51">After the Disastrous Defeat of the Japanese Army in Northern Hunan, Okamura Yasuji's Order to Retreat Was Transmitted by Plane and Shot Down by the Chinese Army <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Guilin Correspondence: The Japanese 106th, 101st, 6th, 33rd, and 13th Divisions, which recently invaded Hunan and Jiangxi, were all under the command of Okamura Yasuji, commander of the Japanese 11th Army. After being severely defeated by the Chinese army, Okamura Yasuji ordered a retreat on October 5th. The plane transmitting the order was shot down by the Chinese army. The original text, after translation by a military agency, is as follows:</p>
<p>Group Operational Order, No. 474, 1200 hours, October 5th, Xianning.</p>
<p>(1) Our army is engaged in a decisive battle with the main force of the Chinese army south of the Yangtze River. We rely entirely on divine assistance and must fight hard together. The Chinese army is tenacious and is still lurking in the areas along both banks of the Miluo River and the Xiu River.</p>
<p>(2) To avoid unfavorable situations, our army should quickly retreat to its original positions to restore combat power and pay close attention to the pursuit by the Chinese army.</p>
<p>(3) The 6th Division should return to its pre-war posture, eliminate the Chinese army that has penetrated deep in pursuit, ensure the stability of the original front line, quickly restore combat power, and prepare to deal with the Chinese army's attack. A part of the division should replace the 33rd Division's defense in the Tongcheng-Chongyang area and cover the retreat of the 11th Field Transportation Unit and the supply stations near Tongcheng, as well as the camping of the Uemura (29th Brigade of the 3rd Division) and Nara (26th Brigade of the 13th Division) detachments.</p>
<p>(4) The 33rd Division, with a strong force, should defeat the pursuing Chinese troops from the Sandu area, attack the Chinese troops lurking in the northern foothills of Jiugong Mountain, quickly hand over the defense of Chongyang and Tongcheng to the 6th Division, and restore its pre-war posture to continue its original mission. Part of the division, operating in the northern foothills of Jiugong Mountain, should return to its established organization at Nanlin Bridge. The 11th Field Transportation Unit should assist the division in transportation with a portion of its forces.</p>
<p>(5) The operational boundary between the 6th and 33rd Divisions will hereafter be changed to a line connecting Tingsiqiao, Baini Bridge, and Xiaoshanjie (50 li east of Tongcheng). The 33rd Division will be responsible for the area on and to the east of the line.</p>
<p>(6) After the 106th Division defeats the pursuing Chinese army on the south bank of the Xiu River, it should return to its pre-war posture and continue its original mission. The operational boundary between the 101st and 106th Divisions is a line connecting Lei Wangdian, Chitu Street, and Changjiagang. The 101st Division will be responsible for the area on the line. The Saeda Detachment (102nd Brigade of the 101st Division) should immediately return to its established organization. Its operational area will be determined by the 101st Division.</p>
<p>(7) After each division retreats to its original posture, the defense boundaries should be redefined.</p>
<p>(8) The Uemura Detachment (29th Brigade of the 3rd Division) should halt the Chinese army's pursuit along the Yuehan Railway and quickly advance toward the vicinity of Linxiang Chenglinji. Starting from October 10th, it should utilize ship transportation and transfer from the Yangtze River to Wuhan. The Nara Detachment (26th Brigade of the 13th Division) should halt the Chinese army's pursuit in Nanjiang and gradually advance toward the vicinity of Linxiang via Tongcheng Beigang Taolin Chang'anyi. Following the Uemura Detachment, it should utilize ship transportation and transfer from the Yangtze River to Wuhan.</p>
<p>(9) The 20th Anchorage Headquarters will be responsible for the ships needed for the transfer of the Uemura and Nara Detachments from the Yangtze River at Linxiang Chenglinji.</p>
<p>(10) The 11th Field Transportation Unit will be responsible for the supply of the 33rd Division between Chongyang, Nanlin Bridge, and Tongshan.</p>
<p>(11) The Komatsu Supply Depot will continue its current mission. The supply of the 6th Division and the Uemura and Nara Detachments will be directly negotiated by each unit.</p>
<p>(12) The Chief of Staff will designate the details.</p>
<p>(13) I am at the Xianning Combat Headquarters.</p>
<p>Group Commander Okamura Yasuji. Method of issuance: Air drop, printed order.</p>
<p>Group Operational Order No. 474. Matters instructed by the Chief of Staff are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The 33rd Division and the 106th Division should quickly collect ships in the Sandu area and retreat to Wuning using the Xiu River.</p>
<p>(2) The 106th Division should carry rations and distribute them to a portion of the 101st Division. The rations arriving near Sandu will be handed over by the 33rd Division.</p>
<p>(3) When part of the 33rd Division retreats through Jiugong Mountain, the 106th Division should do its best to provide cover in the vicinity of Sandu.</p>
<p>(4) The 11th Field Transportation Unit is limited to carrying the rations for two divisions and conducting supplies in Nanlin Bridge by October 10th.</p>
<p>(5) Each division should newly determine the allocation method.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Tax Shortfall in the Puppet Government of Wuxian County: Only One-Fifteenth of the Best Year Before the War <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Although the puppet county government here has been established for over sixteen months, all aspects of the puppet government's facilities are even more chaotic. Puppet officials run rampant, searching and plundering, and the people are filled with complaints. Regarding the collection of taxes, most people are unwilling to pay, causing the puppet county government to often appear embarrassed. It is reported that at the end of the 27th year (of the Republic), only 78,421 yuan was collected in land tax. Before the war, the land tax in this county alone, just the county funds item, could collect over 674,800 yuan. Comparing the past and present, there is a great difference. Although the puppet magistrate Guo Zengji repeatedly organized a Land Tax Collection Office and mobile sub-offices, and frequently sent puppet police to force payment, it was ineffective. The deed tax portion has been meager since it was restarted this spring, less than 5,000 yuan. Due to the sluggishness of commerce, the brokerage tax, including surtaxes, has not reached 10,000 yuan in revenue. Therefore, the total annual tax revenue of the puppet county government is less than 100,000 yuan, only one-fifteenth of the best year before the war.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Shanghai: A Glimpse of Talent Supply and Demand Two Years After the War (7) <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Wen'an, Zheng Wenhan, Shen Guanglie</p>
<p>In terms of professional achievement, trainees are the most successful, accounting for 14.3%. The large number of job seekers means that there are also many successes. Next are drivers, accounting for 13.34%, auto repair at 9.11%, and radio operators at 8.22%. These three types of work are in high demand in the interior, with demand exceeding supply. There are also many successful salespeople, accounting for 7.85%, because there are many opportunities, so the number of successes is still considerable. The success rates of waiters, attendants, clerical work, and primary school teachers are similar to the previous year. However, the success of family tutors has significantly decreased compared to the previous year, accounting for only 3.61% (3% in the previous year). This is because of the abnormal development of schools, with many being established, making enrollment easier, and the number of family tutors decreasing. Overall, drivers, auto repairmen, and radio operators are the most likely to succeed, accounting for 30.77%. They can be said to be the talents urgently needed after the war. In addition, situations of demand without supply and supply without demand also occur from time to time. The mismatch between supply and demand is one of the reasons.</p>

<p>The Jingwu Athletic Association in this city was founded two years before the founding of the Republic of China. The association's affairs have developed significantly. Branches have been established both domestically and internationally. Since the August 13th Shanghai battle, the Shanghai General Association fell into the war zone, and the association's affairs were concentrated in the special district branch at the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road, leading to an abnormal development. Therefore, land was rented on the fourth floor to build a gymnasium to meet the needs of the environment. The opening ceremony of the gymnasium is scheduled for 1:30 PM today. Prominent figures in the city's sports community, including Zhou Jiaqi, Shen Kunnan, Chen Mengyu, Yu Jinxiang, Ding Du, and Chen Linsheng, are invited to the meeting to give speeches. The conference will be chaired by Wu Yaoting, Xu Zhiyi, and Cui Pinxi. Liang Jintang and Zhu Lianxiang are the general directors. To celebrate the occasion, a member individual table tennis championship will be held starting at 9 AM. More than ten people will participate, including Rong Deneng, Chen Zhaowen, Guo Xiquan, and Liang Shaoxiang, who are members of the Guangdong team that won the Shanghai team table tennis championship. There will be exciting performances at the time. The competition will adopt a best-of-three-out-of-five elimination system. The champion will receive a large silver cup, and the runner-up will receive a silver shield. Chen Linsheng has been invited to serve as the referee. Admission is free, and spectators are admitted with invitations. The list of participants is recorded below: Rong Deneng, Chen Zhaowen, Guo Xiquan, Ouyang Wei, Liang Shaoxiang, Fang Guanxin, Gui Jiying, Li Runcun, Li Guoxian, Ju Junyuan, Qian Yushu, and Wang Xingyuan.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Negotiations on Road Construction Beyond the Settlement: The Bureau Will Submit Counter-Proposals; An Agreement Is Expected Soon; The Municipal Council Is Paying Attention to the Police Power Issue <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The negotiations on the issue of road construction beyond the Shanghai Western Settlement have been ongoing since the puppet mayor, Fu Xiao'an, delivered his proposed "counter-proposal" to the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Fessenden, at 5:30 PM on the 11th of this month. Since then, the British and American directors of the Council have been studying it since the 13th (Monday). It has been quiet until now, lasting for two weeks. Yesterday, a reporter learned from reliable sources that the Municipal Council's response to the puppet municipal government's "counter-proposal" may be submitted early next week. The reason for the delayed response is that the British and American directors of the Bureau, as well as the Director-General and Chief Executive Feli, have carefully considered and discussed it with each other.</p>
<p>The Shanghai West Dispute Can Be Resolved Soon</p>
<p>The reporter also visited many key members of the Municipal Council to inquire about their opinions on the future of these negotiations. It is said that it is believed that an agreement can be reached soon between the Municipal Council and the puppet municipal government regarding the dispute over road construction beyond the Shanghai Western Settlement. According to the recent negotiations between the two sides, since the mediation of Lieutenant Colonel Naroni, the leader of the consular body, in late October, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Fessenden, visited Fu Xiao'an on the evening of the 23rd, breaking the deadlock. The Director-General and Chief Executive of the Municipal Council, Feli, and the Chief Constable of the Police Department, Bowen, jointly drafted a plan to resolve the dispute, proposing suggestions on the issue of police power over road construction beyond the settlement, aiming to establish a temporary agreement with the puppet municipal government. It was submitted to the puppet mayor, Fu Bi'an, on the afternoon of November 2nd. After discussing it with the Japanese side, Fu submitted a response with a "counter-proposal" on the 11th, which was then studied by the Municipal Council. The whole process has lasted for more than a month.</p>
<p>Reply Next Week, Submit Counter-Proposals</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post said that this morning (the 25th), it was learned from reliable sources that the Municipal Council will roughly respond to the "mayor" Fu Bi'an's counter-proposal to resolve the dispute over road construction beyond the settlement early next week and submit several counter-proposals. It is said that the Council's reply has been delayed and has not been sent out because the directors of the Municipal Council have considered and discussed Fu's proposal. A reporter asked several officials about this matter, and they believed that the Municipal Council and the "municipal government" would soon be able to reach a proper agreement on the issue of road construction beyond the settlement. According to the original suggestions formulated by the Municipal Council and submitted to Fu, the consultations between the two sides have lasted for more than a month. Fu then submitted a counter-proposal. The deliberation of the directors of the Municipal Council has lasted exactly two weeks. One of the key points of the Municipal Council's efforts to seek a solution is the issue of policing over road construction beyond the settlement.</p>

<p>The English-language "North China Daily Mail" reported that an official at the British Embassy told a reporter today (the 25th) that the Embassy had not outright denied to the "North-China Daily News" reporter the rumors of a meeting between Sir Craigie and Kato. It was discovered that Kato visited Sir Craigie at his private residence on Tunsin Road on Thursday during lunchtime. Subsequently, they entered the Central District in the British Ambassador's car. The two spoke for quite a while, but there was supposedly no political discussion. Officials are maintaining silence on this matter.</p>
<p>Craigie Claims No Negotiations Took Place</p>
<p>An embassy spokesman also told reporters that Sir Craigie said that he and Kato did not hold negotiations regarding the China problem. Kato had lunch on Thursday and then went by car with Sir Craigie to the British Embassy offices in the Central District. The Japanese escort team waited on the Bund.</p>
<p>Rumors are Groundless</p>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reported that a British Embassy official told reporters yesterday (the 24th) that British Ambassador Sir Craigie and Japanese Special Envoy Kato did not hold any discussions in Shanghai regarding British policy or interests in China. The rumors that the British Ambassador would soon be talking with Kato are entirely unfounded.</p>
<p>Johnson and Kato's Courteous Meeting</p>
<p>It is noted that some people attach great importance to the fact that Kato visited the American Ambassador Johnson shortly after Johnson arrived in Shanghai. In fact, it was a courtesy call. Those close to the American Ambassador firmly denied that any formal discussions took place during Kato's visit.</p>

<p>French military commander Remusat, who has been stationed in Shanghai for half a year and has maintained extremely cordial relations between China and France, is being transferred back to his country to participate in the European war.

After more than an hour, the guests and hosts happily took photos and dispersed. It is said that Remusat is scheduled to board a ship tonight to return to his country.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Danish Constable's Detention Incident; Danish Consul Protests to Japanese; Japanese Authorities Did Not Notify Danish Consulate After Detaining Egerborg <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>According to the "North-China Daily News," the Danish Chargé d'Affaires and Consul General, Hill, lodged a formal protest yesterday (the 24th) with the Japanese Consul General, Miura, regarding the detention and maltreatment of Egerborg, a Danish probationary officer of the police force, last Sunday. Egerborg was leading a patrol and search team when an accidental incident occurred at the intersection of Robison Road and Pinlang Road on Sunday morning. He was then summoned to the Danish Consular Court to give testimony. According to reports, the search team led by Egerborg was beaten by "municipal police," who used the butt of their rifles to strike Egerborg. The police department reported that the "municipal police" also fired several shots from their rifles and pistols, but none hit. After this conflict, Egerborg, two Chinese constables, and a female inspector were all "arrested" by Japanese military police. Egerborg and the female inspector were released after being detained for five hours, while one of the two Chinese constables remains in custody. The Japanese authorities did not notify the Danish Consulate General after detaining Egerborg. Hill learned of the matter from the police department and then negotiated with the Japanese authorities. Constable Egerborg and other "prisoners" were first held at the Japanese military police sub-station on Robison Road, unable to communicate with the outside world. They were then transferred to the headquarters of the Japanese military police on Great Western Road, number 94.</p>

<p>Sir Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, visited Horiguchi Masatsune of the Japanese Foreign Ministry on the 24th and held talks for an hour and a half. According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo yesterday, "According to 'Miyako Shimbun' (a newspaper of the extreme faction of the Japanese military), Craigie suggested handing over the silver in the British Concession in Tianjin in exchange for the lifting of the blockade." Yesterday, a reporter from the Datong News Agency made a special visit to a senior British official stationed in Shanghai to ask for his opinion. The official replied, "Our country has repeatedly stated that Britain will not take action regarding the silver in Tianjin without the consent of the Chinese government. Therefore, I have no reason to believe that our government will suddenly decide to adopt a contrary approach. Any contrary news is purely speculation and should not be easily believed. Moreover, the 50 million taels of silver in the British Concession in Tianjin belong to the Chinese government. The British government has no right to dispose of it. Therefore, any negotiations involving the silver issue must be conducted between the relevant parties and the owners."</p>
<h3 id="e72">Barbed Wire Added at the Intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road; Road Blocked; Inconvenient Transportation <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Japanese troops have been increasing their surveillance of residents in the northern district of Suzhou Creek. In addition to regularly sending armed soldiers to search houses, they are also conducting extremely strict inspections of pedestrians entering the Special Area through the gaps in North Jiangxi Road. Any slight non-compliance results in detention. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, a reporter passed through the gap at Haining Road and saw that an additional barbed wire fence had been added to the original barbed wire fence, extending directly into the middle of the road in a semi-circle. Its purpose seems to be to prevent vehicles and pedestrians from approaching their positions. However, this area is an important transportation route. Since the Japanese troops blocked the middle of the road with barbed wire, vehicles and pedestrians have found it quite inconvenient to travel.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Various Organizations Cooperate to Order Foreign Rice Again; Rice Prices Rose Again Yesterday; Purely Accidental Phenomenon <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the prices of various types of rice suddenly surged by two or three yuan, causing panic in society again. According to the rice industry, this was due to difficulties in sourcing. However, according to a reporter's inquiry, this was only an accidental phenomenon. It is learned that various organizations in Shanghai are planning to cooperate to continue ordering foreign rice, amounting to 200,000 bags. As for yesterday's rumors that the ordering of foreign rice might be suspended due to a sudden contraction of foreign exchange, the sudden contraction of foreign exchange was purely a matter of supply and demand. Therefore, the rumors are simply putting the cart before the horse.</p>

<p>While the panic over small change in Shanghai has not yet been resolved, there is also a sudden shortage of dime coins. The Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Zhexi-Di Su Farmers Bank, and other banks in Shanghai have issued a large number of fifty-cent, twenty-five-cent, twenty-cent, and ten-cent subsidiary coin notes, which are sufficient for circulation in the market. Unexpectedly, unscrupulous merchants who disregard the livelihood of the people and only seek to profit dared to hoard and speculate, causing a panic in the market. The general merchants and laborers are feeling great distress in their transactions.</p>
<p>Hoarding of Dime Coins Has Been Stopped</p>
<p>A reporter from the Datong News Agency asked a gentleman from the Farmers Bank of China, who said, "The panic over dime coins in Shanghai is purely caused by profit-seekers. The subsidiary coin notes issued by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and other banks are sufficient for circulation in the market. The authorities have now taken appropriate measures to stop profiteers from disrupting the market.</p>
<p>Fifty-Cent Coin Notes; 100,000 Exchanged Daily</p>
<p>Although the Central Bank has temporarily suspended the exchange of subsidiary coin notes, it will provide a large supply to legitimate merchants after the new subsidiary coin notes arrive in Shanghai. Currently, the Farmers Bank of China is exchanging 100,000 in subsidiary coin notes daily, but only limited to the fifty-cent variety. Although the number of subsidiary coin notes held by the bank is being exchanged as much as possible every day, it can still supply them until the end of the year. Therefore, the panic in the market will soon be resolved.</p>
<p>Large Amounts of National Currency Will Arrive in Shanghai at the End of the Month</p>
<p>Furthermore, a gentleman from the Money Exchange Association told a reporter from the Datong News Agency that there is no need to worry about a panic over subsidiary coin notes in Shanghai. According to sources in the banking industry, a total of 5 million in fifty-cent, twenty-five-cent, twenty-cent, and ten-cent subsidiary coin notes have been shipped from Hong Kong and are being securely transported. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Labor Strike at Reemtsma Shipyard; Labor Side Proposes Conditions; Management Agrees to Consider; Puppet Union Pressures Workers to Register; Workers Are On Strike As A Whole But Are Not Being Exploited <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>A few days ago, the English-owned Reemtsma Shipyard in Yangshupu, Shanghai, laid off thirty long-term workers with many years of service on the pretext of poor business, without fulfilling the labor-management regulations. This caused dissatisfaction among all the workers. Although requests were made, they were ineffective. As a last resort, over 1,700 long-term workers in the factory went on strike to express their opposition. However, the factory did not realize its mistake and instead recruited dozens of White Russian workers the day before yesterday to resume the more important work in the factory's dockyard. Seeing this situation, in addition to the long-term workers who went on strike, the remaining short-term workers, temporary workers, contractors, carpenters, painters, and five ferries of the factory on the Huangpu River, a total of about 3,000 workers, all joined the strike. However, in order to show</p>
<p>Independent Action</p>
<p>and to protect the factory and avoid being manipulated by outsiders, they are eager for labor-management cooperation. Therefore, two representatives were sent to meet with the foreman, an Englishman named Bowman, at 9:00 AM yesterday, and they directly proposed: (1) Immediately release Zhang Shunde, the arrested hole representative, because Zhang was unjustifiably detained by detectives from the Yulin Road Police Station on the morning of the 23rd and has not been released. Although requests have been made by the puppet side, they have been ineffective. (2) Restore the work of the laid-off workers. (3) Fulfill the labor-management layoff regulations. (4) Pay wages as usual during the strike period. (5) Do not dismiss workers without reason in the future. The factory believed that the proposed terms were still far apart but agreed to consider them. Therefore, although the discussions between the two sides were not fruitful, there is still</p>
<p>Potential for Agreement</p>
<p>However, the puppet "Chinese Workers' Welfare Association" seized the opportunity to exploit the situation, forcing the striking workers to go to the association's Pudong branch on Longjiang Road to register, charging each person a registration fee of one yuan. As of the 25th, over 1,300 workers had already registered. However, the puppet organization was still unable to satisfy its desire for exploitation. On the 25th, it issued a notice stating that all striking workers must go to register, otherwise, unexpected events could not be guaranteed. This is enough to show its intentions.</p>

<p>When ordinary citizens in Shanghai use one yuan of legal tender to shop at small stores, they must spend more than thirty or forty cents to get change.

It is now learned that various industries have sent letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, warning the tobacco and exchange industries not to take advantage of the situation to raise premiums, so as not to harm the security of the entire society.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of war in Europe, British and French ships sailing around the world have not announced the dates of their voyages to avoid attacks by submarines of belligerent nations. According to news from the shipping industry, the safety measures on British and French ships sailing to the Far East have become more comprehensive recently. In addition to the armed equipment on British ships sailing on Pacific routes, the ship markings of all countries have been uniformly removed, and blue paint has been applied to the glass windows on the ships. When sailing at night, the lights are completely turned off in places where there is no light-shielding equipment, and additional personnel are assigned to lookout at the bow. If an approaching ship is encountered, a bell is rung as a signal to prevent a collision. Ships stop sailing on moonlight nights, so ships are groping completely in the dark.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Ningbo Native Place Association Asks Shipping Companies to Plan for Traveler Safety; Improve Transportation Methods; Strictly Prohibit Ship Staff from Extorting Money <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai sent letters to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Italian Steam Navigation Company, and other shipping companies, stating, "We are writing because, according to a letter from Wang Lianfang, Executive Committee Member of our Association, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, transportation between Shanghai and Ningbo has been hindered from time to time. Although it can occasionally pass outside the Zhenhai blockade line recently, the difference in height between the ferries and the large ships is too great, making it difficult to board the ships, especially at night. This is especially difficult for women, children, and those carrying luggage. If they are not careful and lose their footing and fall into the sea, they will inevitably be buried in the belly of the fish. This is one of the most dangerous and painful situations. Other situations, such as those waiting for ships in Ningbo who have been staying in hostels for many days, waiting anxiously, but once the Shanghai ship arrives in Zhenhai and they intend to buy tickets to disembark, they find that they have already spent all of their money, making them cry out in despair. And when purchasing ship tickets, they need to find guarantors, etc., which is also difficult to express. Other things, such as the demand for extra fees for luggage handling and from coolies and tea porters, are hateful. Therefore, the above situations are briefly presented to you, hoping that you can use your enthusiasm and make it your duty to maintain the livelihood of our hometown. It is hoped that you will inform the Ningbo authorities and shipping magnates to jointly devise proper measures to value life and facilitate travel, which would be a public convenience." Therefore, we are writing to you to inquire and discuss, and to find ways to improve things within a possible range to facilitate travel. We would be grateful.</p>

"Your letter No. 1980 (Foreign Affairs) dated August 29 and a copy of your work report have been received. You and other enthusiastic members of the troop have not avoided danger or feared sacrifice, following the national army in advance and retreat, serving at the front and in the rear. Your spirit is admirable and your work is practical and profound. I am deeply impressed. At this time of national crisis, it is of great benefit to have comrades like you go deep into the interior and awaken the masses to fight together. The future of the war of resistance is promising. I hope you will not neglect the distance and will continue to give me your guidance from time to time to communicate news. I am eagerly looking forward to it."</p>

<h3 id="e85">Japanese Troops Land in Beihai — Aiming to Cut Off the You Long Yong Road. By John Ahlers, Translated from the "Secret Comments" Report <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>(Continued) If the Japanese army wants to blockade the last port of "Free China," they should attack the three ports of Leizhou, La Ba (transliteration), or Fuzhou. The foreign trade of "Free China" is greater in these ports than in Beihai. According to customs records for September of this year, the imports of "Free China," excluding war materials, totaled 4,200,000 gold units, and exports totaled 8,500,000 yuan. The most important customs checkpoints for "Free China" are as follows:</p>
<p>September 1939 Location Imports (in gold units) Exports (in yuan)</p>
<p>La Ba 762,859 2,843,308</p>
<p>Longzhou 577,074 2,570,670</p>
<p>Leizhou 564,708 2,067,601</p>
<p>Fuzhou 907,195 63,179</p>
<p>Mengzi 579,097 38,420</p>
<p>Beihai 69,685 836,530</p>
<p>These six customs checkpoints account for over 99% of the exports and 95% of the imports in the areas controlled by Chongqing. In addition, Longzhou and Mengzi have very important transportation routes for war materials and other military supplies. This, along with the general cargo traffic, makes Longzhou and Mengzi the most important foreign trade centers on the border of "Free China." Mengzi, as is well known, is a checkpoint on the Yunnan-Burma Railway. The transportation capacity of this railway has increased from 3,000 tons per month two years ago to over 20,000 tons currently, thanks to a French banking group. It is expected to reach around 30,000 tons by the next Lunar New Year. Today, one of the two major land trade routes from the south into "Free China" is this French railway. If the Chinese side can overcome the difficulties and quickly distribute all goods arriving in Yunnan Province via the railway, then the railway can transport even more goods.</p>
<p>The general public is not as familiar with Longzhou as they are with Mengzi, and it seems that they believe that the Yunnan-Burma Highway is the only other land trade route in southern "Free China" besides the French railway to Kunming. This impression is incorrect. In fact, the other route is the Haiphong-Longzhou-Yongning road. Comparing the traffic on these two routes, the trade on the Yunnan-Burma Highway is insignificant. Longzhou is connected to Haiphong not only via the Lang Son railway, the northwestern terminus of the Vietnamese railway, but also by the first-class modern highway built during this Sino-Japanese War directly to Hanoi. This well-equipped highway continues slightly northwest from Longzhou into the interior of southern Guangxi, directly to Yongning. Throughout this year, the large-scale automobile traffic on this road has brought a continuous flow of imports into "Free China," more than the imports via the French railway to Kunming. It is just that the Chinese side is unwilling to publicize this road.</p>
<p>When the Yuehan Railway is blocked or lost, this Long-Yong Road becomes a vital communication artery. The central government recognized the importance of this road two years ago. In January 1938, the central government and the French banking group, which had been responsible for building the Yu-Rong Railway before the war, signed a contract stipulating that instead of building the Yu-Rong Railway, a railway would be laid from Yongning to Zhennanguan on the Vietnamese border. The planned route is almost parallel to the Long-Yong Road. The construction of this line should have been completed a year ago, but many non-technical difficulties have repeatedly delayed the work. The people in the Yongning area seem to be very opposed to this railway project. Only in recent months has construction been accelerated, with a completion date set for January of next year. It is planned to lay a railway connecting Yongning and Liuzhou (the new Guangxi Railway from Hengyang via Guilin temporarily ends at Liuzhou) in the summer or autumn of next year.

<p>The Central News Agency reports that a major fire broke out near Yanping Road, western Shanghai, yesterday afternoon at 1:15 PM, resulting in the death of one child and the destruction of seventy or eighty houses, all reduced to ashes. It is said that there was a vacant lot at No. 279, Nan Ye's House, Lane 175, Yanping Road. Poor residents in the vicinity had been building straw huts there for shelter. Over time, the area became a slum, with more than a hundred straw huts of various sizes. When the fire broke out yesterday, it was not known which household was careless. The flames spread rapidly, and with the northwest wind howling, the fire quickly became uncontrollable, with flames engulfing all sides. The Central Fire Brigade and the Caojiadu Fire Brigade were notified and rushed to the scene, and it took a long time to extinguish the fire. As a result, over a hundred straw huts were destroyed, and several factories in the area, including the Jiu Fu Cotton Mill and the Zhongzhang Machinery Factory, were also destroyed in the blaze, resulting in significant losses. A four-year-old child surnamed Mou was buried in the flames.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Counterfeit Tram Tickets Discovered – Three Arrested Awaiting Investigation <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 4 PM, a passenger named Zhao Tingdong attempted to use a two-cent long tram ticket issued by the tram company on a Route 14 trolleybus. The ticket seller determined that it was a forgery and asked him to exchange it. Unexpectedly, the replacement ticket was also fake, so the police were called and Zhao was arrested and taken to the Laozha Police Station. Under investigation by Detective Tao Rubih, Zhao stated that he obtained the ticket from Tang Youfang, a Zhenjiang native residing at No. 57, Lane 676, Putuo Road, and did not know if it was genuine. The detective then led the police to Tang's residence, where they found him living in a kitchen shed with a printing press, a small printing workshop. Tang was the owner and employed Chen Yiming from Shaoxing as a partner. Tang and Chen were arrested, and 133 counterfeit tram tickets were found on them. They were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Fourth Criminal Division of the Special No. 1 Court. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, indicted them for fraud and forgery under Articles 339 and 22 of the Criminal Law and explained the circumstances of the case. It was found that the counterfeit tickets were slightly smaller than the genuine tickets, and the Chinese and Western characters on them were also slightly smaller. The defendant Tang Youfang confessed to forging a total of 30 to 40 yuan worth of tickets in the police station, selling each yuan's worth for 80 cents. Tang Youfang admitted that he resorted to this measure due to economic difficulties. Chen Yiming denied assisting in the forgery. After Judge Zhan verified the statements, he ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody and set the sentencing for next Wednesday.</p>

<p>Ma Jinhua, a woman from Ningbo, 21 years old, represented by lawyer Zhou Yu, filed a petition with the Civil Division of the Special No. 2 Court against her husband, Yu Deming (34 years old, from the same place as the woman, currently residing upstairs at the Gongxin Sauce Garden at No. 8514 Beile Road, who is the owner of the Gongxin Sauce Garden), seeking a conciliation for the dissolution of the family relationship. The reason stated in the petition was that she could not endure the insults and abuse from the defendant and his principal wife. The petition stated that the petitioner's father died early, and she lived with her mother. In 1927, the petitioner, then 19 years old and living in Hongkou, met the defendant on the street. He found her attractive and courted her in every way, inviting her to the cinema. After the movie, he lured her to a room in the China Hotel on Guizhou Road, where he forcibly raped her. Then, he used inducements to have the petitioner's mother sign a contract acknowledging the petitioner's marriage to him as a concubine. At that time, the petitioner was deceived and had no choice but to rent a house with the defendant at No. 269, at the intersection of Kaizier Road and Songshan Road, and live together. Before long, she was subjected to insults, scolding, and beatings. In July of this year, the defendant forced the petitioner to live with his principal wife upstairs at the Gongxin Sauce Garden he owned on Beile Road. The petitioner was then subjected to joint insults and beatings by the defendant and his principal wife, making it impossible for her to continue living with them. Therefore, she requested conciliation to dissolve the family relationship. Upon receiving the petition, Judge Liao Yuan of the court summoned both parties to court for conciliation yesterday morning. The petitioner, accompanied by her lawyer, appeared in court and stated the reasons for her petition. The defendant also appeared in court with his lawyer, Tang Hao, and expressed his agreement to dissolve the family relationship, stating that the petitioner's mother currently lives at No. 30, Lane of Cao Street, Yidingpan Road, Daxi Road. However, the petitioner had taken 600 yuan in cash and left without saying goodbye. The defendant had posted a notice in the newspaper searching for the runaway concubine. However, after the dissolution, the petitioner could no longer make any claims against the defendant in the capacity of a family member. The petitioner also agreed to this point. The court then ordered the clerk to prepare a conciliation record, which was signed by both parties and their lawyers, establishing the conciliation and dissolving the family relationship between the two parties forever.</p>

<p>There are seven or eight wood shops, tinfoil shops, and antique shops opposite Zilai Street on the old North Gate, on the Chinese territory of Minguo Road. They have all been closed since the war, with one or two people assigned to watch the buildings. The prosperous French Concession is just across the street, separated by an iron gate. There are Japanese military sentries and police posts at the gaps in the old North Gate and new North Gate. At 9 PM on the 24th, under the bright lights of the French Concession, more than a dozen bandits openly removed the signboards and carried them away, and emptied the items inside. The people in the French Concession stood and watched. Such a phenomenon in such a bustling area, also a refugee zone and a Japanese military sentry zone, is astonishing. It is said that the school buildings of Datong University, Junyi Middle School, Jingye Middle School, and other schools have been demolished to the ground, and the bricks and tiles are being transported out for 20 yuan per 10,000. A group of transportation companies, after obtaining licenses, are openly using them as tools for selling and transporting stolen goods. Therefore, Nanshi will soon become a blank slate.</p>

<p>**Qiao Zhipu Switches from Short to Long Positions; Concludes Huge Sum of British and American Foreign Exchange Transactions; Exchange Market Continues to Shrink Drastically; British Gold Enters the Five-Office Mark**</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The unofficial British and American exchange market was brisk because Saturday was only a half-day trading session, so buying and selling appeared particularly tight. The situation continued the momentum from the previous evening and continued to shrink. British gold has entered the five-office mark, and the American exchange rate once broke into the eight-yuan mark. The market's sudden confusion was due to the weakness of operators' awareness, being misled by rumors, and following the buying trend. It is also heard that from December onwards, Hong Kong will strictly prohibit speculation and will no longer sell foreign exchange for arbitrage in Shanghai. However, the leader among the buyers should be the Jewish speculator Qiao Zhipu, who has switched from a short to a long position, with a huge amount. In the early morning, because the British and American exchange rates rose sharply by 4.75 points, the opening price for British gold was five offices, shrinking by 0.0625 compared to the previous day. The American exchange rate was still 8.1875 yuan. Initially, those unfamiliar with the market were still hesitant, and the situation was slightly relaxed at five offices 0.03125 and 8.25 yuan. However, soon, speculators began buying, and daily merchants also joined in. When the Jewish merchant simultaneously started buying British gold, it immediately retreated into the five-office mark, at four offices 90625. The American exchange rate was reported at eight yuan. Later, Chinese banks, seeing the trend, rushed to sell, and Hong Kong telegrams supplied their intentions and rose slightly by 0.0625 and 0.125. Unexpectedly, Sassoon suddenly came to collect, and British gold softened to four offices 8125. The American exchange rate had been called as high as 7.75 yuan, the tightest price of the day. Fortunately, Chinese merchants in the cotton yarn industry were very willing to sell, and the market stabilized, extending until the closing, without moving. The prices were four offices 90625 and eight yuan. Compared to yesterday, British gold continued to tighten by 0.15625, and the American exchange rate softened by 0.1875. The futures market trend was similar to the spot market.</p>
<p>**American Exchange Rate Once Enters Eight Yuan**</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London exchange rate showed shrinkage of 0.0615 for both near and far terms. New York's silver price remained flat, and London's raw gold was stable. The exchange rate of British to American dollars and to French francs was flat. The exchange rate to Shanghai shrank by 0.25. The American exchange rate increased by 4.75 points against the French franc, a large difference of 2.5 points, and a small difference of 0.03 points against Shanghai. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained as before. Banks opened for spot transactions in the morning, with a selling price of five offices for British gold and 8.1875 yuan for the American exchange rate, tighter by 0.025 for British gold and unchanged for the American exchange rate compared to the previous close. Due to the sharp rise in the exchange rate, some banks had some appetite after opening, and the market trend was slightly hardened. British gold returned to five offices 0.03125, and the American exchange rate rose to 8.25 yuan. Soon, speculators' buying suddenly increased, and the situation immediately turned tight. British gold immediately broke into the five-office mark. Subsequently, the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhipu and Japanese yarn factories heavily bought forward British and American exchange rates. At the same time, Japanese banks and foreign firms also came to compete for buying. Although foreign firms still had the intention to supply, the head positions were difficult to allocate. Therefore, the underlying trend continued to soften. By 9:30, British gold had tightened to four offices 90625, and the American exchange rate had also shrunk to eight yuan. HSBC's listed price was announced as unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced as small 0.35. After that, Chinese banks suddenly took advantage of the goods to sell, and telegrams from Hong Kong also came to supply, so the market briefly saw a slight recovery. British gold hardened to four offices 96875, and the American exchange rate rose to 8.125 yuan. Subsequently, the Western merchant Sassoon suddenly came to absorb strongly, and sellers gradually decreased, causing the situation to become tight and soft again. By the time of the previous hour, British gold was called as tight as four offices 8125, and the American exchange rate had also been called over 7.75 yuan. At that time, Chinese merchants in the cotton yarn industry and other long positions took profits and exited, and Sassoon had stopped absorbing, so the situation slightly recovered. Extending to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were four offices 90625 for British gold and eight yuan for the American exchange rate. The prices for December were four offices 84375 for British gold and 7.875 yuan for the American exchange rate. As a result, the current and forward British exchange rates continued to tighten by 0.1625, and the American exchange rate softened by 0.1875 compared to the previous day. There was no trading session in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>

<p>Yesterday's cash gold bullion unofficial market continued to rise again. Due to the continued volatility of the foreign exchange market, the desire of gold sellers became even stronger. In addition, there were numerous rumors in the market, deceiving oneself and others, and the atmosphere was unbearably chaotic. The situation was unstable. Although in a rising trend, the intermediate trend often ran counter to the foreign exchange market. It was rumored that from December onwards, Hong Kong would strictly prohibit speculation and would stop selling foreign exchange for cash, causing buyers to be wary. Although people's hearts were firm, they were also uncertain. The foreign exchange market tightened sharply, but the gold price only rose by slightly more than 1%, still fluctuating. Initially, inheriting the rising momentum of the past three days, the foreign exchange market softened, and a certain money exchange company took the lead in dumping, causing the price to soar. In the early morning, it rose to 3,880 yuan. Later, amidst the tightening sound of the foreign exchange market, due to rumors among exchange dealers that there would be a major buyer reducing cash purchases, it was difficult to arouse the excitement of buyers. On the contrary, under the selling pressure from money exchange companies, securities firms, and gold shops, retail investors also rushed to sell. It had twice retreated to a low price of 3,820 yuan. Unexpectedly, as the foreign exchange market turned from tight to soft, both British gold and the American exchange rate entered the five-office and eight-yuan marks. The appetite of Hong Kong and other customers recovered well. Another securities firm's acceptance was also strong. Under the buying pressure, it soared to 3,885 yuan. Finally, due to retail investors taking profits and exiting, there was not much improvement. The closing price was 3,860 yuan, a rise of 40 yuan. There was no trading in the field in the afternoon. According to the situation outside the field, it was still mediocre, only fluctuating by 7 yuan. The highest price was 3,865 yuan, the lowest was 3,858 yuan, and the final price of 3,860 yuan was said to have no sellers. The morning's transactions were still strong, about 2,000 taels. Gold shops listed gold five yuan higher. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.</p>
<p>**Bullion Has Also Risen for Four Consecutive Days**</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels), the opening was quite tense. Buyers were still crowding, and the market was chaotic. Large buyers rushed to buy, so the bulls took advantage of the momentum to raise prices. The opening soared by 60 yuan. A money exchange company bought 20 taels of gold at 3,880 yuan. Soon, the foreign exchange market reported a slight hardening, and people's hearts weakened, and buyers suddenly thinned out. In addition, a certain gold shop tended to sell, and securities firms also came to sell. In an instant, 60 yuan was poured out. A securities firm sold 20 taels to a cash gold shop at 3,820 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange company suddenly came to buy at a bargain, and the exchange market had turned soft, rebounding by 40 yuan. A money exchange company did 50 taels at 3,860 yuan. Later, because the foreign exchange market suddenly hardened again, it aroused the selling appetite of gold shops. In addition, floating long positions took profits and exited, so it fell back to a low of 3,820 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange market tightened sharply again, and Hong Kong firms suddenly began buying, entrusting a certain gold shop to buy on their behalf. At the same time, a certain securities firm and a certain money exchange company also frequently bought for customers, and the price soared by 65 yuan. Securities firms and certain money exchange companies each bought 30 taels of gold at 3,885 yuan. Near noon, it was heard that the foreign exchange market was slightly hardened, and the rising momentum was suddenly thwarted. General profit-taking retail investors rushed to sell, and soon it fell back by 45 yuan. A money exchange company sold 10 taels to a gold shop at 3,840 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop came to absorb, pulling it up by 20 yuan. A gold shop bought 10 taels from a money exchange company at 3,860 yuan, as the noon closing price. There was no trading session in the afternoon on Saturday. As a result, it rose by 40 yuan compared to the previous day. It has risen for four consecutive days, totaling 210 yuan, fluctuating by 65 yuan in half a day. The cash gold shop's own brand of gold was sold at a price 10 yuan higher than bullion, and purchases had to be reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current standard gold was 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold, with few transactions.</p>
<p>**Ornamental Gold Suspended at 390 Yuan**</p>
<p>Initially, major gold shops still suspended the exchange of gold jewelry at 385 yuan per tael. Until 9:40, it was listed 5 yuan higher. There were no changes after that. As a result, major gold shops changed to suspend at 390 yuan. The new gold shops had the same prices as the previous ones, with purchases reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's unofficial securities market still showed no improvement. The sharp rise in gold further undermined the bond market. However, after the evening closing, it was rumored that a certain person would extend their term as Minister of Finance, and the price turned slightly firm. Yesterday's morning and afternoon sessions were both weak and unable to rise. A slight increase the day before was immediately crushed. The weakness and lack of vitality in people's hearts cannot be salvaged by the current situation. However, speculators in the market have different understandings. Therefore, Taifeng, Lianyi, Lianhe, Fuchun, and Tongkang were either short covering or adding to long positions. However, the 20th and 20th Kang were sold throughout the day. Tiansheng and Tongkang were also selling off. Different people have different opinions, and each is inconsistent. There may still be changes next Monday.

After a period of violent fluctuations, buyers regained the upper hand at the close.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Grains: Many Opportunities for Manipulation; Rice Prices Rise Again by Several Yuan; Foreign Exchange Tightening Makes Imported Rice Expensive; Price Increases and Purchases Lead to Uniquely High Prices in the Future <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Recently, rice prices have been constantly changing, sometimes rising and sometimes falling, making them difficult to grasp. Since the sharp rise last week, reaching a peak of 40 yuan, the market paused before turning bearish. Within a few days, prices fell sharply by as much as 6-7 yuan. This kind of unexpected fluctuation has been described by those in the industry as an unprecedented anomaly. Generally, those in the industry are adopting a more cautious approach. Recently, since the day before yesterday, the market has suddenly turned from soft to tight again. Yesterday morning's opening broke the silence and presented a sensational scene. Generally, speculators, because of the arrival of imported rice, are seeking to manipulate the market. On the one hand, they create a false atmosphere, and on the other hand, they use their magic to collect at high prices, leading guest merchants to take the opportunity to raise prices and hold onto goods, refusing to sell easily. Local guests are also deeply concerned, regardless of the truth or falsity of the news. Inland merchants are also adding to the situation, causing all prices to rise steadily. By midday, prices had risen by more than one yuan, which further heightened people's expectations and intensified the market atmosphere, with an unstoppable momentum. Among all the goods, thick japonica rice was the most sought after. During the sharp decline, the prices of japonica rice tips were chaotic and inaccurate. Therefore, the closing market was the only one to rise by as much as 2-3 yuan. Ordinary Bo-te japonica rice opened at 37-38 yuan. As for the remaining Bo Dao Ying, and Lu Yang Jian Ke Jian imported rice, the prices of all goods rose by varying amounts of 1-2 yuan compared to the previous market. Qing Jiao Bo Dao opened at 33 yuan, Feng Jia Bo Dao at 31 yuan and 30 yuan, an increase of 2.5 to 2 yuan. Bai Yuan was at 34 yuan, Ying Yuan at 33-31 yuan, also up about 2 yuan. Lu Yang Jian was at 33-34 yuan, Jiangbei Jian Jing Wu Jian at about 32 yuan, up half a yuan. Saigon opened at 33 yuan and 31.5 yuan, an increase of 1.5 to 2.5 yuan. According to statistics, a total of 30-40 truckloads of goods arrived from the Sujia Road area, with transactions of no less than 14,000 to 15,000 bags.</p>
<p>Guest indica rice is still arriving in small amounts, and there is a large supply of imported rice. However, the price has already been higher than that of Zhongjue japonica rice, and importers have been watching. The market seemed to have a need to gradually return to balance. However, yesterday's sudden change in foreign exchange caused the price of imported rice to be raised, and the truckloads of rice were blocked. The price of japonica rice tips soared, and guest indica rice was also manipulated by importers and speculators, with prices rising by one yuan. The high-end price was 33 yuan and 32.5 yuan, followed by 31 yuan. Only 2,000 bags were traded.</p>
<p>Imported rice was affected by foreign exchange yesterday. Chinese and foreign merchants raised prices by more than one yuan, and new transactions were even more difficult to approach. The spot goods in the market took the opportunity to raise prices. 1,000 bags of Annam japonica rice opened at 24 yuan and 33 yuan. Saigon No. 1 opened at 33.5 yuan to 32.5 yuan, also at over 1,000 bags. However, the rice stored in Hong Kong is successively being transported to Shanghai, and the previous batches of orders also have 2-3 ships departing. There is no need to worry about a lack of supply in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Yarn and Cotton: Frequent Tightening of Exchange Notes; Buying of Cotton Yarn Rises Again; Prices Rise Again by More Than 10 Yuan <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which was flat and hovering the previous day, rebounded strongly yesterday. This was because the exchange notes shrank on the afternoon of the previous day, and tightened further yesterday. People's hearts were agitated, and speculative buying rebounded. At the same time, the exchange rate affected the exchange price of imported cotton, which secretly increased. Therefore, although actual sales were affected by the war, the weak acceptance of Hong Kong firms did not have much impact on the market. In fact, the rising trend of foreign exchange resurgent, generally domestic accounts excited sentiment rebounded, so the situation is stepping forward, 20-count Double Horse peak price of 668 yuan. If sales move, the rising trend will be even more intense.</p>
<p>The morning opening of the current yarn was still peaceful due to the decline in Indian cotton. However, there were few sellers, and generally the scalpers snatched up goods when prices fell, so the market trend was higher. When the foreign exchange rate opened, it was shrunk, and the shout to buy was loud. The market rose higher and higher, jumping more than 10 yuan, with a price of 668 yuan. In an instant, it was said that the foreign exchange rate had relaxed, falling 6 yuan to 662 yuan. By the closing time, the price rose again to 668 yuan due to the hardening of the shilling and US dollar. According to statistics, 1,402 bales were traded in half a day. The price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 10 yuan, Tiannv rose by 10 yuan, and Double Earth rose by 12 yuan. The amount of purchases by various firms is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Same Industry 920, Fuzhou 80, Hong Kong 37,</p>
<p>Xiamen 25, Inland 10, Ningbo 40</p>
<p>Total: 1,402</p>
<p>**Yarn Prices Flourish, Raw Cotton is Hoarded, Rises Again by 3-4 Yuan**</p>
<p>The trading of local cotton is still developing, but in the trading environment, those who hold the goods all have an optimistic outlook, with a tendency to hoard goods. The reason is that the shrinkage of exchange notes has resumed, yarn prices are flourishing, and the overseas cotton market is continuing to rise. Although Indian cotton fell in the official market, it is predicted that the telegram will rebound by 7-8 rupees, so everyone only has the intention to buy and no intention to sell, resulting in a slight decrease in transactions. However, transactions between colleagues are still enthusiastic. The market price of the current cotton is mostly the same as the previous market. In the afternoon, it was heard that the news was even better, and sellers avoided selling and quoted very high prices. The market price rose by 3-4 yuan compared to the previous day. Xinyu Factory purchased 500 pieces of American cotton, also at the spot market price. From the source of Northern Jiangsu, 1,476 bales of Tongzhou flower arrived, and 785 bales came from Beihe. The current cotton situation is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Huoji Flower 136.00, Same Industry Purchase, 15 bales</p>

<p>Haiti Jian 140.00, Also 200 bales</p>
<p>Also Packaged 144.00, Also 200 pieces</p>
<p>The market price of imported cotton, the New York cotton market, turned weak in the morning due to the forecast of a decline in Bombay, but ended higher due to the purchase of speculators. Spot transactions also increased as a result. Peers also purchased heavily in the market. As a result, the closing price rose by 6-7 pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market rebounded by 10 rupees today along with the forecast. The Egyptian cotton market fell by 70 pounds, and the Liverpool cotton market rose by 10 pence.</p>
<p>The trading of imported cotton in Shanghai, yesterday the exchange rate tightened, and each industry held a wait-and-see attitude. Factories were also quiet. Except for Shenxin and Xinyu and other factories, which purchased slightly at lower prices, no other factories were heard to have traded. Even Japanese manufacturers have been quieter recently. The daily cotton market is listed below with prices converted at an exchange rate of 8 yuan per US dollar:</p>

<p>The local silk market is seeing more turnaround in foreign sales. Baichangjing opened at 4,300 yuan, a rise of 100 yuan, after 70-80% of the goods were sold. B-character 13-15 grade silk was priced at 4,800 yuan, and 20-22 grade silk was priced at 4,100 yuan, a rise of 100-150 yuan. This was due to the benefit of foreign exchange.

<p>Love Absolutely Cannot Be Guaranteed by Marriage Contracts</p>
<p>That marriage requires a contract is common practice in countries around the world. It is important for mutual legal protection and proof. However, it absolutely cannot guarantee love between a man and a woman. Marriage should be based on love; no one can deny this. If love cannot be guaranteed by marriage contracts, then isn't marriage very dangerous? Answer: Not necessarily. Although marriage contracts indeed cannot guarantee love, the lasting health of the sexual functions of both the man and woman is a solid guarantee of love. A self-respecting man who has never committed self-pollution or nocturnal emission in his youth and does not indulge in excessive lust after marriage will inevitably have lasting sexual health. Such a man, full of vigor and strength, can harmonize with his beloved wife's sexual tides. When both are intensely interested, how joyful and sweet is their love life! At the same time, "a pure heart and few desires produce many sons." Clever children and a happy family truly bring a sense of joy and harmony! Even in old age, with white hair and eyebrows level, children and grandchildren filling the hall, they are praised by relatives and friends and respected by society. How meaningful and happy is their life! On the other hand, if a man is romantic in his youth, commits self-pollution or nocturnal emission, or indulges in unrestrained lust after marriage, his sexual functions will inevitably be severely damaged, leading to premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, neurasthenia, kidney deficiency, and lack of offspring. If he cannot achieve the goal of a fulfilling sexual life with his wife or is completely unable to perform sexually, then even if he had made vows of eternal love, she will inevitably feel the sorrow of wasted youth, a lonely and tasteless life, eventually leading to a breakdown in their relationship, mutual scorn, or even adultery and elopement. Countless modern women will righteously file for divorce from their husbands!</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be shameful and pathetic for a man to encounter such a situation?! To seek remedy and prevention, according to world-renowned doctors and my own experience, taking the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproductive Essence) is the most effective and appropriate treatment. This agent is made from the endocrine essence of the gonads extracted from strong animals such as gorillas, bears, deer, lions, tigers, and sea dogs, using scientific replication methods. Its active ingredients are completely preserved, so its quality is precious and its effects are certain and rapid, surpassing any similar preparation. After taking it, sperm production and kidney replenishment occur within a day and night, strengthening the brain and activating blood circulation. It is advisable to take it continuously, which will further promote development and nourish the nerves, surely curing various symptoms within a short period. Taking it continuously throughout the winter will increase body weight and prolong life. Middle-aged and elderly people will rejuvenate and regain the happiness of youth. This is an ironclad fact. German renowned doctor (Weldean) Dr. Weilding has repeatedly conducted clinical experiments with this agent. In 3,654 cases, based on the principle of gonadal endocrine supplementation therapy, he had them continuously take "Sheng Zhi Su." As a result, 1,231 cases of incomplete development, 1,870 cases of premature ejaculation and impotence, and 549 cases of kidney deficiency and lack of offspring all achieved satisfactory therapeutic effects. It is acknowledged that one-fourth of the middle-aged and premature aging individuals did indeed benefit from longevity and rejuvenation. Therefore, this agent is renowned globally and praised as the only great tonic for both men and women. It is now also available for sale in major pharmacies such as Central and Western Five Continents in this city. I have also cured tens of thousands of patients with this agent. However, those suffering from spermatorrhea must also take the sacred medicine for treating spermatorrhea, "Hi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (Hymeto's Semen-Consolidating Tablets) (actual price of each box is two yuan) to strengthen the seminal gate, stop leakage, and achieve rapid results! If patients can personally come to my clinic for diagnosis and treatment, it will be even safer and more reliable.</p>

<h3 id="e116">The Evaluation of Breasts in Female Happiness <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— By Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>European and American women not only have a higher cultural level than our Chinese daughters-in-law, but they are also much more sophisticated in their pursuit of beauty. Yesterday, I read a book by French author Ms. Ai Er Xuena entitled "Happy Families in Wartime." Besides explaining the great responsibilities they bear in wartime, there is a passage discussing their overall happiness. She says, "A woman who wants to obtain supreme happiness cannot ignore the development of all parts of her body, especially the breasts. Because if the breasts are well-developed, appearing full and high, then undoubtedly the hips will also be plump and exquisite. In that case, the most mysterious and valuable curves of a woman are formed. Naturally, she will have a graceful figure, and men cannot help but be drawn to her. And you can freely choose a desirable husband to spend warm and sweet years with. Isn't that boundless happiness? On the other hand, if your breasts are withered or flat like a man's due to self-pollution, tight corsets, leucorrhea, lack of libido, poor nutrition, irregular menstruation, etc., would a clever and fickle husband be willing to let you through the door? Even if the man is cultured, it is inevitable that the couple will be outwardly harmonious but inwardly estranged. What affection can be spoken of? Naturally, there is no talk of happiness. If you encounter a man who is unfaithful and lacks devotion to love, then the tragedy of her fate is even more unimaginable." To seek remedy, one can only trust in science. According to renowned Chinese and Western doctors and my own experience, it is generally acknowledged that taking the ovarian preparation for women "Sheng Zhi Su" is the most effective and appropriate treatment. After taking it, it can nourish the ovarian function, promote metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus and stop leucorrhea within a day and night. If you continue to take it throughout the winter, not only can the withered breasts become full and high, but it can also redden the cheeks, enhance the love between husband and wife, and bring boundless happiness.</p>
<h3 id="e117">The Causes and Consequences of Spermatorrhea <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— By Zhan Nianzeng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>American hygienist Dr. Gulick said: "Health is the crucial starting point." This is truly a profound saying. If one has a weak and sickly body, feeling powerless even when sitting and eating all day, what can one do? Countless young people have lost their health due to spermatorrhea. They mostly ruin their sexual nerves due to committing self-pollution, engaging in homosexual love, early marriage, indulging in lust, etc., causing the seminal gate to loosen. In addition, hardworking young people who overuse their brains and energy, or those who are congenitally weak, have imbalances after illness, and those suffering from neurasthenia may also experience spermatorrhea and seminal emission. Semen is the source of our human life. Physiologically, it is produced through advanced differentiation. As the main substance for reproduction, it also nourishes the nerves, regulates emotions, promotes development, and adjusts metabolism. If one suffers from spermatorrhea and thinks it is insignificant, delaying treatment, in addition to directly affecting the reproductive function and continuing to cause premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, kidney deficiency, and lack of offspring, various symptoms such as brain fatigue, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, premature aging, diminished energy, sallow complexion, and emaciation will also inevitably occur. How can such a weak and sickly young person strive and compete with others in academics and careers to achieve a bright future? As for the foundation of love in marital life, they will be even more weak and incompetent, or even completely unable to perform sexually, constantly causing various tragedies in the family! Therefore, anyone suffering from spermatorrhea must seek early and thorough treatment. First, treatment is easier, and second, the vital energy is less depleted. The method of treatment is to quickly take the world-renowned sacred medicine for treating spermatorrhea, "Hi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (Hymeto's Semen-Consolidating Tablets). After taking it, it can consolidate the seminal gate, calm the nerves, and achieve the miraculous effect of restful sleep and stopping spermatorrhea every night. If there are already one or more of the above-mentioned symptoms, it is necessary to also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" extracted from strong animals to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood. Continuous taking will surely cure various symptoms and restore perfect health within a short period. If patients can personally come to our clinic for electrotherapy and injections, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>

<h3 id="e118">The Outline of the Northwest <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Mang</p>
<p>The Northwest began to draw attention long before the War of Resistance, but it was after the War of Resistance that the Northwest's importance in national defense became increasingly clear, and the National Government actively carried out various plans to develop the resources and transportation of the Northwest. The tide of China's War of Resistance and nation-building swept into the Northwest, completing various preliminary basic facilities at an astonishing speed. This is indeed a gratifying phenomenon since the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>The Northwest in Geographical Terms</p>
<p>The so-called Northwest, in terms of its outline, includes all of the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Suiyuan, and Ningxia, as well as a part of Outer Mongolia. Topographically, it is a plateau area, with an average altitude of over one thousand meters. It has a vast area and a sparse population. Gansu has an average of only 15 people per square kilometer, Suiyuan has an average of only 7.5 people per square kilometer, and Ningxia has an average of only 1.38 people per square kilometer. Compared to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the difference is truly enormous. Therefore, the Northwest is not only a base for the War of Resistance, but also a refuge for the dense populations of the Southeast in the future.</p>
<p>The Northwest in Historical Terms</p>
<p>Historically, from the Zhou and Qin dynasties to the Han and Tang dynasties, the Northwest has been the center of Chinese politics and culture. During the prosperous times of the Han dynasty, it controlled the Central Plains from the border fortresses and competed with various northern ethnic groups in this area for thousands of years. Maintaining the Northwest was often a sign of the prosperity of the Han dynasty, while losing the Northwest was often a sign of the decline of the Han dynasty. The Northwest and the interior are often interdependent like lips and teeth. Guanzhong is the shield of Western Shu, while Gansu, Suiyuan, and Xinjiang are the shields of Guanzhong. When Liu Yu of the Jin dynasty led his troops north, his power had reached Guanzhong, but because Ningxia was in the hands of Helian Bobo at that time, Helian Bobo eventually took advantage of the situation and plunged Guanzhong into the hands of the barbarians. The reason why the Southern Song dynasty was able to maintain Sichuan for a hundred years was because Wu Lin and Wu Jie had the victory at Heshangyuan, preventing the Jin people from peeping into Shu from southern Shaanxi. Now, the invasion route taken by the Japanese is also to peep into Shaanxi from Shanxi, and then to approach Sichuan from Shaanxi. Therefore, to defend Sichuan, we must first defend the Northwest. This spring, when a certain country's ambassador was about to return home, he earnestly advised our people to defend the Northwest and shield the Southwest as the primary task for our country to recover lost territories. The meaning behind this is naturally profound and should not be regarded as commonplace.</p>
<p>Importance in International Transportation</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, we have suffered from not having a navy. Coastal ports have either fallen or been controlled by the enemy. The only ports we can rely on for international transportation are the Northwest and Southwest routes. The Southwest international transportation route requires borrowing from British and French territories, and the only route that can directly communicate with other countries is the one that connects the Northwest to the Soviet Union. In this sense, the Northwest is not only an important place to shield the Southwest, but also a route for international transportation. It is a pity that the transportation achievements from the Northwest to the Southwest are only in the form of highways, and the railway trunk lines running through the north and south are still lacking. To meet the needs of transporting a large number of heavy weapons, we still need to actively proceed in this area.</p>
<p>The Unity of Various Ethnic Groups in the Northwest</p>
<p>In terms of the ethnic groups in the Northwest, the West is a complex area with distinctions between the Mongol, Uyghur (Chantou Hui), and Tibetan groups. In the past, these groups often had many disputes due to differences in language, religion, and unequal political treatment, which was naturally not a blessing for the country and the nation. Fortunately, since the War of Resistance, all ethnic groups, regardless of each other, have unanimously supported the Central Government and jointly fought against foreign enemies, and the unity of all ethnic groups has become closer. Moreover, the great officials who are now in charge of the military and civilians in the Northwest, such as General Ma Hongkui of Ningxia, and Generals Ma Bufang and Ma Buqing of Qinghai, are all Muslim military and political leaders who support the Central Government and will surely lead the brave Muslims and people of other ethnic groups to defend the territory. The problems that should be paid attention to in the future are naturally numerous and cannot be exhausted in one word. However, in terms of the biggest and most important, there is nothing more than developing resources to enrich national power and educating talents for national use. Guanzi said, "Land that is not cultivated is not our land, and people who are not educated are not our people." At this time when foreign troubles are pressing, we should pay double attention to these two points.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Miscellaneous Notes on Guanzhong, the Heart of the Great Northwest: Advancing Can Lead to Victory, Retreating Can Lead to Defense, With Strong People, Sufficient Food, and a Strong and Secure Terrain <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Guanzhong, that is, present-day Shaanxi, has the Great Wall to the north, the Qinling Mountains to the south, the Yellow River encircling it to the west, and the Longshan Mountains winding to the east. It is a very large basin. Because it is located in the center of the four passes of Tong, San, Wu, and Xiao, it is called Guanzhong. Since ancient times, this has been a place for strong soldiers and horses. The Qin people were not only known for their martial spirit, but also brave in public warfare, so they were able to destroy the six states, unify the world, and establish an imperial career. During the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, when he expanded the territory and opened up the borders, the good sons of the northern region often made the greatest contributions. Ban Gu said: "Since the Qin and Han dynasties, ministers have come from Guandong, and generals have come from Guanxi," which is truly a well-aimed evaluation. The famous Tang general Guo Ziyi once said when discussing Guanzhong: "The land is thousands of miles wide, with hundreds of thousands of armored soldiers. The soldiers are strong and brave, looking powerfully in all directions. If there is an advantage, they will attack; if there is no advantage, they will retreat and defend. This is a country of military use, unlike anything else in the world." It can be seen from this how brave the Qin people were.</p>
<p>As for products, the fertile fields are thousands of miles wide, and the yields of wheat, cotton, sorghum, etc. are abundant. Every year in late spring, the wheat waves on the plains are layered upon layer, like waves of ten thousand acres. Therefore, it is called the "land sea." Among the minerals, coal and petroleum are the most important. North of the Qinling Mountains, from Longxi to Tongguan, Hancheng, north through Yan'an to Shenmu, there are extremely thick coal seams. It is said that the reserves are more than 47 million tons. The petroleum area extends from Jia County and Mizhi in the north to Yijun and Tongguan in the south, and from Ansai in the west to the Yellow River in the east. Oil seedlings can be found everywhere, and the oil field area is 150,000 square miles. Now, the official petroleum factory is located outside the west gate of Yan'an. If new methods of extraction and refining can be used, it will definitely be of great help to the War of Resistance. Because the people are brave, the terrain is dangerous and secure, and the products are so abundant, the Zhou, Qin, Sui, and Tang dynasties all established their capitals here.</p>
<p>The culture here was very developed in ancient times and was the center of Chinese culture. Even today, the ancient sites and cultural relics preserved in Guanzhong are still very rich. As long as someone is interested in studying culture, they can collect a lot of valuable literature and data when they come here. That is certain.</p>
<p>The transportation here has been very convenient since the Longhai Railway from Tongguan to Xi'an was built. Since the rise of the military, in order to connect foreign traffic, the Sino-Soviet Highway, which was difficult to construct, has been fully opened to traffic with the cooperation of the military and civilians. This road passes through the Guanzhong Plain, with Xi'an as the general station for freight transportation. It is said that the Sino-Soviet Railway is also planned to be built. Now, although the eastern section of the Longhai Railway has been occupied, the section from Luoyang to Xi'an is still unimpeded and bears the important task of military transportation. As for the Sino-Soviet Highway, it is a major artery in the War of Resistance. In the past, it has exerted a lot of strength.</p>
<p>There are countless famous places and historical sites here. Because Xi'an is an ancient capital, there are ancient tombs and palace ruins everywhere in the suburbs and nearby. Among the tombs, the most noteworthy is the Xuanyuan Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor. The tomb is located outside the city of Xianyang. In recent years, the central government has sent political dignitaries to sweep and worship every year. The so-called "national tomb sweeping" refers to this. Others include the Mausoleum of King Wen, the Mausoleum of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, and the Mausoleum of Emperor Wu (also known as Maoling). Unfortunately, because they have been through many changes in the world, most of them are covered with weeds. As for the ancient palaces, the more famous ones are Changle, Weiyang, Afang, and Jianzhang. Now, only the ruins remain for people to mourn. The cities in Guanzhong are headed by Xi'an. It is not only an ancient capital, but also where Chiang Kai-shek was in distress during the "December 12" Incident. The name of Xi'an was once publicized in the mouths of people all over the world. Others include Tongguan, the ancient ferry of the Yellow River, Yan'an, the "red capital," Nanzheng, the upper reaches of the Han River, and Sanyuan, the commercial port of northern Wei, are all important cities. At this time when the Japanese army is eager to try Guanzhong, I hope the warriors of Guanzhong will rise up to defend the country and maintain the glorious history of their ancestors!</p>
<h3 id="e120">Gansu Growing in the Midst of the War of Resistance <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Huizi</p>
<p>War is indeed a kind of destruction for China, but for Gansu, which has a backward culture, it gives a new force and vitality. Gansu is located in the northwest of our country, 980 miles away from Shanghai. The central and surrounding areas are all mountains, the most famous of which is the Kunlun Mountains? The Yellow River and Wei River irrigate the south.</p>
<p>After the War of Resistance, the continuous immigration from various places has greatly changed its old appearance: many forward-looking young people with new ideas and sound physiques who have lost their homes in this decisive battle have continued to move to Gansu. As a result, this ancient and feudal Lanzhou has leaped into the center of China's industry and transportation. At the same time, it is also the transportation hub for China to enter the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In 1866, Zuo Zongtang established an arsenal in Lanzhou. Recently, the central government reorganized and improved the old factory, and Lanzhou has become one of the important supply bases for China's military needs. There are many aircraft manufacturing factories and component assembly plants here. The personnel of this component assembly plant not only include many Chinese and Soviet experts, but also many American aviation engineers. The basic workers are all Chinese, most of whom have migrated from the East. Due to the constant need for workers in the factories, as well as other road construction and river dredging work, strong men are needed, so the work on the farms is entrusted to women. Their most important work is planting and picking cotton.</p>
<p>Among the new construction projects, the most important is the construction of highways. And the most important line of the highway is the Lanzhou to Xinjiang line - the middle section of the Sino-Soviet highway. The goods supplied to China by the Soviet Union and the raw materials exported from China to the Soviet Union all pass through this place. Most of the vehicles coming and going on this highway are Soviet-made large and heavy vehicles specially designed for carrying heavy loads, which are similar in form to American vehicles of the past few years, and a small part are new American Dodge vehicles. In addition to cotton, other industries in Gansu also have promising prospects, especially the coal industry, which has even greater prospects. In short, the war has given Gansu a lot of new vitality, and Gansu Province will show a new face in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Northwest's Four Major New Canals Under Construction <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, the Chinese government has always held the goal of "War of Resistance and National Construction" and strived to move forward. In order to improve agriculture in the rear, "to enrich the economy and benefit the people's livelihood," special attention has been paid to water conservancy projects in the Northwest. Last summer, the four major canals for irrigating farmland were built in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and other provinces, costing 20 million yuan. Now, the following four new canals are being excavated.</p>
<p>1.  Lohui Canal</p>
<p>The Lohui Canal is the most important canal among the four major new canals, located in central Shaanxi. The excavation project was launched four years ago and is now nearing completion. The project cost is estimated at 2 million yuan. The whole canal is crisscrossed with branch canals, forming a shape similar to a spider web. The total main canal is 145 li (Chinese miles) long. The whole canal has one roller dam; five tunnels, the longest of which is one li; two sluices; 45 bridges; and 31 drainage canals (i.e., drainage culverts). The water volume of the whole canal is sufficient to irrigate more than 22.5 million mu of farmland.</p>
<p>2.  Heihui Canal</p>
<p>The Heihui Canal runs across the cotton and wheat producing area in central Shaanxi. The biggest reason for opening up this canal is the imbalance of rainfall there. The project cost is estimated at 160,000 yuan. Now, a sluice is being built on the Heishui River in Zhengyang County, and this river is used as the main canal, and then main and branch canals are opened up to the two banks of the area. The water volume of the whole canal is expected to be able to irrigate 5.4 million mu of farmland.</p>
<p>3.  Dredging of the Jing River</p>
<p>Baoji and Fengxiang, the commercial centers in southwestern Shaanxi, originally had tributaries of the Jing River distributed around them, but the riverbed was not dredged, so it could not be used to its full potential for irrigating farmland. Now, the government will dredge the tributaries of the Jing River and open up new canals at the same time, so that the canal water is sufficient to irrigate 5.4 million mu of fertile land on the left bank of the Jing River. The whole canal project is actively underway. The total main canal is 65 li long, the tunnel is 3,380 feet long; in addition to the large dam, there are large water gates and gate passages, 40 bridges, and 30 drainage canals. The total cost of the whole canal is 730,000 yuan.</p>
<p>4.  Huanghui Canal</p>
<p>The Huanghui Canal is in Gansu. In July of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the central government invested 250,000 yuan to build a Tonghui Canal. The Huanghui Canal is the second largest canal in the province. The canal water is drawn from the Yellow River in Yongdeng County in the central part of the province. The total main canal is 50 li long. The water volume is sufficient to irrigate 1.61 million mu of farmland, and the project cost is estimated at 300,000 yuan.</p>

<p>4.  There are forest areas left undeveloped in the mountainous areas of the Northwest, and there are also spruce forests along the western areas, which are the best raw materials for making wood pulp.</p>
<p>5.  Shaanxi has a large amount of white coal reserves, estimated at 71,950 million tons, and Suiyuan has 4.14 million tons of bituminous coal.</p>
<p>6.  Petroleum is produced near Yanchang in Shaanxi and Yumen Dunhuang in Gansu, as well as Urumqi, Suilai, Usu, and Tacheng in Xinjiang. At present, 7,500 catties of petroleum can be extracted from the three Yanchang wells every day.</p>
<p>7.  Xinjiang is rich in gold ore, with 50,000 gold miners. Qinghai also produces gold, but the gold production in the Northwest is still unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e123">The Place Where Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek Encountered Disaster <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>At about 9:00 am on December 12, 1936, the troops of Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng, stationed in Xi'an, Shaanxi, suddenly mutinied. At that time, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek was staying at Huaqing Pool near Xi'an with a small number of guards. The troops of Liu Duoquan, the commander of the 105th Division under Zhang's command, forced their way in with weapons, and the Generalissimo was kidnapped. Many of his guards were killed. Zhang made eight demands, but the Generalissimo did not comply. Later, Zhang and Yang repented and sent Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek back to Nanjing, and Zhang himself also went to Nanjing to plead guilty. This incident not only shocked China and foreign countries, but also eliminated most of the estrangement between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and was a turning point for the revival of our Chinese nation. Now, there is a memorial pavilion built of stone on the side of Lishan Mountain in Lintong County to commemorate the event. The attached photo is the monument built there.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Qinghai… The Center of Asia <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Huan</p>
<p>The Heart of Asia</p>
<p>Although the idea that Kunlun is the center of the world is a legend dating back to mythical times, it happens to be right in the center of the Asian continent. Although some books describe the overall shape of Asia as trapezoidal, none recognize it as a circle. The line formed by the islands of Southeast Asia, the line formed by the Ural Mountains in the northwest, and the line formed by the Persian Gulf in the southwest are all fairly regular circular arcs. If these circular arcs are connected into a circle, then the only areas outside the circle are Asia Minor and the Arabian Peninsula in the southwest, and the Verkhoyansk region in the northeast. The center of this circle is within Qinghai, China, and more specifically, in Xing宿海. If there were direct air routes from Leningrad to Shanghai and from Karachi to Miao Street, their intersection would also be within Qinghai.</p>
<p>Practical Significance</p>
<p>What is the practical significance of this theoretical center? As a matter of fact, in the past, it has shown its central position in transportation, and when transportation will be planned as a facility leading to civilization in the future, this central position cannot be ignored. The road from the east to Tibet, via Xining, Dulan, and Yushu, is much easier to travel than the one via Kangding, Ba'an, and Qamdo; the road from the east to Xinjiang, although the Jiayuguan route is more convenient, if going to the Hotan area, the Dulan and Ruoqiang route is actually less prone to wind and sand, and the only inconvenience is the lack of residents along the route. The road from Qinghai to the northeast, along the Yellow River, is commonly used; from Qinghai to the southeast, there are also old transportation routes along the Yalong River and Jinsha River. The transportation line from this road into Qinghai and then westward to Tibet is slightly easier to construct than the transportation line through western Sichuan to Tibet. In this way, China has the possibility of establishing a radial transportation line with Qinghai as the center. Originally, the transportation plan with Lanzhou as the center was similar in form to this, and to the west of it there was also the Lanzhou-Lhasa line, the Chengdu-Zongzhasak line, and the Zongzhasak-Ruoqiang line, with Zongzhasak as the intersection point. If these lines are completed, then the center of Zongzhasak will in fact take away the central position of Lanzhou, because from here there can be a shorter route to the sea via the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Historical Basis</p>
<p>This transportation line is still ideal, and the Chengdu-Zongzhasak-Ruoqiang line will pass through the area with the least population of all routes. However, the sparse population in this area is actually the result of neglecting forestry and animal husbandry. In the past, nomadic peoples often used Qinghai as a gathering point, so historically Qinghai was a meeting place for various ethnic groups in the country. The Han Chinese themselves have a saying that they originated from the ruins of Kunlun; the Qiang people have always based themselves here; if the Hephthalites were the ancestors of the Tibetans, then the Tibetans also once lived in Qinghai; the homeland of the Xiongnu was probably also here; even the Xianbei in the east once established the Tuyuhun Kingdom here; although the theory that the Turks originated on the sunny side of the Altai Mountains may not be credible, the Uyghurs did take this as their center of activity, so the Uyghurs and Tibetans almost had a tendency to merge in the Tang Dynasty; the Western Xia established a great power with the Dangxiang Qiang, and never allowed the Khitan forces to invade, and its strength was formed by gathering the Uyghurs, Tibetans, etc.; the Xia culture was quite advanced and able to harmonize the various tribes under its jurisdiction; however, after the destruction of the Mongol Empire, this place became a place of contention between the Mongols and Tibetans, up to the present day. In the Yuan Dynasty, the relationship between the Mongols and Tibetans was still good, but it was the Qing Dynasty's policy of supporting the Tibetans and suppressing the Mongols that made it worse. In addition, the Qing Dynasty was particularly harsh on the Hui people, preventing them from communicating with the Tibetans, so Qinghai became a place with a sparse population. Now that the political status of all ethnic groups is equal, what remains is only suspicion of encroachment on the right to survival. If a planned development is carried out, capital should be imported first to make their lives more prosperous. With a prosperous life, all ethnic groups will naturally gather again, and gathering will increase prosperity. If we know that gathering is the cause of prosperity, we will definitely know how to improve mutual relations. Just from the fact that this is a gathering point for the Qiang, Tibetan, Mongol, and Hui people, this is also the most important place for ethnic issues in the country, and the development here is urgent.</p>
<p>Qinghai's Minerals</p>
<p>It is difficult to say how much hope there is for the future of forests and livestock. Qinghai's unique geographical environment may greatly limit their development. However, another source of wealth, minerals, is very abundant here. Songpan, Erkai, Ruoqiang, and Hotan are all gold-producing areas, and Qinghai itself also has gold production, and its output may be beyond imagination. Other minerals should also not be lacking here. Although the geology of this area has not been carefully surveyed, it is generally recognized as belonging to the Variscan orogenic system, which is equivalent to the mountain system including the Saar, Bohemia, Donets, Ural, and other mineral-producing areas in Europe. Although the era may be earlier, minerals should not be lacking in such a zone. The eastward extension of this mountain system, the Yinshan, Qinling, and Minshan mountains, also has quite rich mineral resources, which is enough to show that this area may have mineral resources. Qinghai may be a place that is not inferior to the Baikal region. When the Siberian Railway was built, the richness of Baikal could not have been imagined. We can calculate the richness of Qinghai and build the Chengdu-Ruoqiang road. Without convenient transportation first, there is little hope even for exploration.</p>
<p>To retreat to the most basic level, even if all the conditions and their promising future do not allow for reckless boasting, simply the fact that it is theoretically the center of Asia, we will feel proud of it emotionally. Pride can arouse cherishing, and the way to cherish is to give it brilliance. Then, psychologically, we will also feel that this is a place that should be devoted to.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Northwest Furs <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Ju</p>
<p>Animal husbandry and hunting are the main sources of wealth in the Northwest, and the residents of that area rely heavily on animals for their clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Their meat and cheese, before the canned food factories were widely established in the Northwest, these delicacies could only be enjoyed by themselves. However, animal furs can be sold elsewhere after being processed. The yellow fur coat you will soon wear is mostly produced there.</p>
<p>The export of furs, taking Xinjiang province alone, even in the worst market conditions during the camel transportation period, was worth 1,849,100 yuan per year. If all the Northwest provinces are included, the export was more than 70 million yuan before the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>The types of furs include fox fur, otter fur, wolf fur, snow sweeping fur, gray squirrel fur, lynx fur, wild cat fur, wild monkey fur, white lamb fur, red lamb fur, dog fur, etc., and hair such as camel hair and wool.</p>
<p>Recently, a person from a certain country established a Northwest Fur Trading Bureau in Tianjin and sent a group of unscrupulous merchants to establish a branch in Baotou, buying Northwest furs everywhere. It is said that they buy them for 50 or 60 yuan per 100 jin and sell them for 300 yuan in Tianjin. Originally, the export destination of furs has always been Tianjin. Since it was occupied, it has been controlled and monopolized, so they can do business with a profit of 10,000%.</p>
<p>Now the people of Gansu, Shaanxi, and other provinces have tried to prevent it, and the authorities have strictly prohibited the sale of goods to a certain party. Alas! Unscrupulous fur merchants who have lost all conscience, don't you know that "when the skin is gone, what will the fur cling to?"</p>
<h3 id="e127">Extended Petroleum <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>Among the provinces in the Northwest, Shaanxi has the highest petroleum output; and within Shaanxi, the various districts of the Yanchang County in the north have the most abundant output. The output within 50 li of this county almost exceeds the total output of Fushi, Luochuan, and other places. Oil seepages are everywhere, and the richness of its reserves can be seen. However, why has the petroleum market in Shaanxi been controlled by foreign merchants for a long time? Simply put, it is because of obstacles in transportation, economic difficulties, and limited manpower for development, so only small-scale well drilling and extraction can be carried out. Therefore, its output is only enough to supply the needs of the nearby area. The unlimited treasure is still buried in the ground, and Shaanxi is not truly barren.</p>
<p>In recent years, our government has actively engaged in construction and development of resources. The provincial highway network has been completed, and the oil springs in the area are also extracted and refined using scientific methods. The various oil areas that were previously contracted with American merchants but not developed have been reworked; the oil springs in Lijiazhuang, Yanwugou, and other places are also being actively developed. Not only has the obstacle of transportation difficulties been removed, but also the old method of oil extraction has been abandoned, which has also increased a lot of output, with a rapid development trend.</p>
<p>The Yanchang Oil Factory outside the West Gate of the county is relatively large in scale. Each oil well is equipped with a 20-horsepower gasoline engine and a 50-horsepower boiler. New wells such as No. 137 produce the most oil, with daily crude oil production ranging from 80 gallons to 1,000 gallons. Because its output is not fixed, if the daily crude oil production is 300 gallons this month, 1,000 gallons the next month, and 500 gallons the month after that, it is impossible to predict.</p>
<p>The extraction work of each oil well now uses machines instead of manpower. Before starting oil extraction every day, a motor is used to pump water (previously it was done by people rocking the pump). After the big pump has pumped for three hours, the water in the well is exhausted and crude oil then appears, this crude oil can only be pumped for a few minutes to half an hour, then the oil is gone. After the crude oil is extracted from the well, it is sent through a pipeline to the oil storage tank (the size of the tank varies, the largest can hold 50,000 gallons, and the smallest can hold 2,000 gallons.)</p>
<p>Now it's time to talk about the refining method of crude oil after it comes out of the well. The so-called crude oil is unrefined and not immediately usable petroleum. After the crude oil is input into the oil refining furnace (capacity of 1,000 gallons), fire is started to refine the oil. The crude oil is heated to boiling and emits a steam, which is gaseous oil. The gaseous oil is injected into the pipeline through a leaker, and becomes liquid oil after passing through a cold water pool, then it is bleached with sulfuric acid (Acid Sulphuric) and then put into the oil storage tank. Every 1,000 gallons of crude oil, after refining, can produce about 300 to 400 gallons of petroleum, requiring 200 jin of coal.</p>
<p>After the crude oil has been refined into petroleum, a large amount of residue remains in the boiler. This residue is "wax", yellow-black, and becomes white wax after being leaked and made into foreign candles.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Mongolian Yurt <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— You Ren</p>
<p>A Mongolian yurt is the ordinary residence of Mongolians. The bottom of the yurt is built with earth, and the top is covered with felt, which can be moved at any time. This kind of yurt is not surprising, the most surprising thing is that there is a procedure when entering the yurt: (1) First, the whip in hand must be placed outside the door, because it is a taboo for Mongolians to enter the yurt with a whip, they think that this will be detrimental to their livestock. (2) The door of the yurt is divided into two sides, the right side is the human door, and the left side is the ghost door. Therefore, when entering the yurt, you should pay attention to entering and exiting through the right door. (3) In addition to cooking utensils, the furnishings in the yurt are mostly Buddha statues and rosary beads, etc. But people who go to the Mongolian yurt must not touch their pot stove, they believe that there is also a fire god in this pot stove.</p>
<p>Strange customs (1) Their residence can be moved, but cannot escape the limits of this territory. (2) No houses are allowed to be built except for lama temples. (3) Family members are not allowed to cut their hair. (4) Men and women in the territory are not allowed to wear long clothes at any time. (5) Only lamas can wear yellow clothes, others are not allowed to misuse them. (6) No one can wear black clothes. (7) Women of this banner are not allowed to marry banner people at will (referring to other banner people). There are also prohibitions on carrying long whips, wearing turned-up shoes, drinking alcohol, and smoking. They encourage people to believe in Buddhism and venerate lamas. The most special and strangest custom of Mongolia is that they are very happy for other people to live in their place, but there is no bed, everyone sleeps on the earthen kang with a large quilt, men and women are not separated, the guest and his family's women lie side by side, and there is nothing surprising, but when he gets up the next morning, he sees you sleeping back-to-back with his wife and daughter, he is very happy and regards you as a distinguished guest. If you sleep face-to-face, he thinks you have committed adultery with his wife and daughter, he will definitely cut off the tails of all your livestock, then you will not be able to stay anywhere.</p>

<p>— Guan</p>
<p>I still remember reading a poem about Zhaojun leaving the frontier when I was young. The first two sentences were: "Looking back at Changmen, tears flow in the dark, the spring in the felt city is like the autumn in the Han palace!" I can't remember the third sentence, and the fourth sentence is: "The slave is looking around, the concubine is sad!" When reading it by the dim light of an oil lamp in the whistling north wind, I often shed tears. The shadow that floated in my mind was: the spring in the felt city is not as good as our spring where "the face is warm when you go out, and the spring is in the bleak willows", and the coldness of its winter can be imagined. How can Zhaojun, with her delicate beauty and weak body, withstand this harsh climate? The shameless Emperor Yuan of Han could not defeat the Chanyu, and cruelly sent her to him to please his master, so Zhaojun looked back at the Han palace Changmen, daring not to wipe her tears openly, but only letting them flow in the dark. This is just like the recent group of Suzhou young ladies who were invited to visit a certain country, perhaps they are also shedding tears in the dark!" Reading "looking around" and "sad", people are not made of wood or stone, who would not shed tears of sympathy!</p>
<p>Zhaojun's surname is Wang and her name is Ma, a native of Zigui, Hubei, one of the four beauties of our country. At the age of seventeen, she was selected as a palace maid because of her beauty, living a life where "tears drip on the idle steps, growing green moss". Later, Huhanxie Chanyu invaded the border, and the court strongly advocated peace. The Chanyu wanted a beautiful girl, and Zhaojun became the sacrificial lamb. Her tomb is twenty li south of Guihua City in Suiyuan. The tomb covers thirty acres, and the tomb is almost twenty zhang high. A monument stands in front of it, called "The Tomb of Ming Concubine of Han." There are quite a few broken monuments, and the handwriting is difficult to distinguish. Among the newly built monuments, there is one inscribed with "The Shame of Cowards." This is worth pondering and reflecting on.</p>
<p>There is mostly yellow sand on the border, and the grass is all withered yellow or gray-white. Only the grass on Zhaojun's tomb is often green. The locals call it the Green Mound because of this. "Leaving the purple platform to the vast desert, only the green mound is left facing the dusk." This is Du Fu's poem about the Green Mound.</p>

<h3 id="e131">On Invention and Discovery <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Ci Kai</p>
<p>Judging from many facts, invention is not an easy thing. This is not to discourage you, but to encourage you. Four or five years ago, I was still a child, and I also read many stories of inventors. At the same time, I wanted to be an inventor. But now I know that I am definitely not worthy. The story that Watt invented the steam engine when he saw the pot lid lift is unreliable. In fact, before Watt, Tom Newcomen had already built a steam engine, and he just changed it. Marconi's invention of radio was not his own effort either. Originally, someone had discovered radio waves in his time. Newton saw an apple fall and discovered gravity, also because he originally had a foundation. The reason why we don't see chestnuts fall and also invent gravity is not because it has already been discovered by him, but because we are too ungrounded.</p>
<p>Many great inventions have a good foundation, or the help of others' research. Things invented by one person are probably very few. Perkin invented the famous coal tar dye at the age of seventeen, he was really helped by the guidance of a famous teacher. Darwin's creation of the theory of survival competition was also due to travel, discussion, and the works of others. Some people say that if Darwin was born in China, he probably would not have such a great invention. This is true.</p>
<p>But there are many inventions that do not require much effort. Small ones like someone's invention of a rubber-tipped pencil, and large ones like Wilson's invention of the method of making acetylene by wanting to extract calcium from lime, can be said to be accidental. A few years ago, an American scientist discovered that putting the wheel algae that raise goldfish in water would prevent mosquito larvae from growing, which aroused many people to study it. This type of invention is relatively easy. Many industrial inventions in our country are almost all done by people who have not received advanced education. There is an Ameng in Wenzhou who did not graduate from elementary school, but later invented a wooden cotton ginning machine and opened an iron factory. Many people who have studied for decades have not learned from him.</p>
<p>It is a pity that the talent for invention is buried in the era of studying. However, if you want to invent, now is the time to work hard to read new books to build a foundation.</p>
<h3 id="e132">A Letter from Old Broken Toys to Shanghai Children <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Ying Dai</p>
<p>This is a sad story—the story of forgotten and broken toys.</p>
<p>In the dark closet, they are imprisoned, covered with dust, and will never be touched by the lovely little hands of happy children again. Therefore, they want to write an open letter to Peggy, Mary, William, Franklin, and other Shanghai children. The letter is written like this:</p>
<p>Dear Kind Children:</p>
<p>Pity us, oh, please pity us! We are locked up lifelessly in your closets, small houses, and dark corners. The glorious days are over. At that time, you put us in new boxes, and often took us out to play with, looked at us carefully, as if you loved and cherished us very much. Now we are old, and our bodies and spirits are weak, and we are no longer worthy of your attention. Peggy, can you hear us? Mary, Dorothy, and John, Dick, Paul, please listen to our appeal?</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are many children who have never seen our faces, and have never played with us like you. These children really want to get us, talk and laugh with us, and show us love. Therefore, please take us out, repair us, and add new paint, so that we can see children want us again, smile at us, and play with us.</p>
<p>If you are willing to do this, you can call 34220, and someone will be sent to pick us up and send us to the Rotary Toy Hospital. There, our faces and machines can be completely repaired. In this hospital, it is amazing, they will repair us like new. The only purpose is to rescue us from the darkness, so that we can look forward to a great day—Christmas Day. On that day, you will be very happy to know that we can be happy again to make other children happy. Your old friends can be reborn and send happiness to other children.</p>
<p>From your old broken toys.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Winter Snow —Ming'er's Refugee Diary No. 44— <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Bai</p>
<p>The New Year passed away in the blink of an eye. In the minds of the villagers, it seems that this New Year is extraordinarily short, although they have been reveling as much as possible in the past few days, they still cannot be completely satisfied. On the contrary, everyone in Ming'er's family felt that this New Year was particularly long. Seeing others celebrating the New Year, and recalling the joy of celebrating the New Year in the past, they would often be moved by the scenery and aroused their sadness in vain.</p>
<p>At that time, it was of course the middle of winter, and the northwest wind was extremely rampant. All day long, it used its scraping means when it encountered people's faces, making those villagers hide in their homes and dare not stick out half of their heads. The whooshing sound between the treetops howled one after another, which was more lively than the intermittent firecrackers in the New Year. Except for the traces of the wind on the streets, the new atmosphere of the New Year had long dissipated and it was cold and clear, and even the shadow of a dog was not easy to find.</p>
<p>The northwest wind was getting tighter and tighter. The clouds in the sky were driven together by the wind in pieces. The grass and trees on the ground... everything was trembling in the wind. In short, the atmosphere between heaven and earth was full of desolation. This was a sign before the snowfall - which the farmers in the village had been waiting for for a long time.</p>
<p>The warmth in every corner of Ming'er's home was scoured by the wind. There were no heating appliances in his house, and they relied on some thick clothes to keep warm, so they always felt the cold stinging their faces and shivering. In normal times, they could always light a small stove to reconcile the external cold air, and in a moment the whole room would be warm, as if it were spring. But now even a stove for cooking was borrowed from someone else, so where did the stove come from? Moreover, even if there was a stove in this village, there was nowhere to buy coal.</p>
<p>It was not until that night that the scene before the snowfall was arranged very properly by the wind, and the snow fell in pieces. In the beginning, when the snow fell to the ground, those exhausted creatures used their heat to resist. Sure enough, the snowflakes dissolved in tears. However, the snowflakes continued to press down on the ground, and those creatures with only a weak breath struggled until only the last breath was left, and were crushed to death by them. The snow piled up in pieces. After falling for the whole night, it transformed the original appearance of the world into a brand new scene.</p>
<p>When Ming'er woke up, his eyes suddenly brightened. The snow-white light shone in from the white paper window, extraordinarily dazzling. He slipped out of bed, pushed open the window, and everywhere was a silvery white.</p>
<p>The vast expanse of white filled the sky, making it impossible to tell which was the mountain peak and which was the ridge; which was the plain and which was the jungle; it was impossible to distinguish the north and south; everything was boundless, as if one was in the vast ocean.</p>
<p>In this all-white environment, Ming'er's dull mood was washed clean, and he was extremely happy. He put on his leather shoes, put on his gloves, and went out to play in the snow. As soon as he walked out the door, he was hit in the neck by a snowball thrown by the three older children next door, and they laughed so hard that they couldn't close their mouths. He was cold and ashamed, and wanted to take revenge, so he quickly prepared a lot of hard snowballs and started a battle of one against three, he resisted desperately. The three of them hid behind the short snowmen they had built as defenses. He rushed over even more bravely, and with one shot, he hit the head of the snowman. The three aggressive older children also scurried away, and he had invisibly won.</p>
<p>His whole body was heating up, and his spirit was very happy. From this snow battle, he learned a lesson: "Don't be afraid of the cold, you have to struggle to get hot! Shame is not enough to be ashamed of, you have to struggle to clear it!"</p>
<h3 id="e134">Refugees on the Street <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Shihui</p>
<p>The sky was not yet bright, when suddenly I heard moans and low sobs from the street. I was awakened by their sounds, so I gently got up and opened the window to look. I saw two dark figures below, one moaning under the eaves, and the other sobbing on the cement.</p>
<p>I thought, "We are also refugees. We still have a house to live in and clothes to wear. Shouldn't we show some compassion? Perhaps we ourselves will end up in this state one day. Alas! In these past two years, I don't know how many children have lost their parents, I don't know how many compatriots have been buried by cruel cannon fire, and how many have been blown to pieces by bombs. We are fortunate to be able to study in this environment…"</p>
<p>"Miss, Miss, what are you doing?"</p>
<p>It turned out that the sky was already turning a fish-belly white. Auntie Li had gotten up to cook breakfast. She saw me standing alone by the window in a daze, and asked me what I was doing, interrupting my thoughts.</p>
<p>After a while, it was bright, and Auntie Li had finished cooking breakfast. I asked her to serve two bowls of porridge for the two poor refugees, who had been freezing and starving for who knows how long. I couldn't help but laugh at the way they ate, so hungry. Suddenly, I felt a pang of conscience. "You want to laugh at them? Do you have a conscience?"</p>
<p>So, I silently picked up my schoolbag and went to school.</p>
<h3 id="e135">The Blue Dwarf (10) <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Li</p>
<p>Soon they arrived at a large tree. In the middle of the tree, a small lamp hung, emitting a bright blue light. One of the dwarves said, "We're here, we're here! We've arrived at the village entrance." Then all the dwarves climbed up the tree, swarming like a hive of bees. After going up a certain distance, they disappeared one by one. Alice couldn't see anything except the small lamp with the blue light. She was secretly surprised, wondering if they were just going to abandon her here? Suddenly, she heard a shout. Looking up, she saw two dwarves standing on a branch, lowering a rope ladder, and beckoning her to climb up. Alice didn't hesitate and easily climbed up the rope ladder, step by step, to where the two dwarves were standing. Only then did she see them and understand why they had suddenly disappeared. It turned out that the trunk of the big tree was hollow, with steps carved inside like a staircase. The dwarves then beckoned her to go down. Alice was curious and immediately went down the steps one by one. However, the steps were very narrow, making it difficult for her to stand firmly, and she almost fell. Fortunately, she was very careful, and aside from a few slips, she didn't fall. The ladder seemed very long. The further she went down, the darker it became. Eventually, there was no light at all. Fortunately, she felt that she had reached the end of the ladder, and her feet were on solid ground. After waiting for about half a minute, she seemed to see a door open, and a scene of unexpected beauty unfolded before her eyes.</p>
<p>This was a dwarf village! Rows and rows of small houses, none taller than Alice herself. But they were quite comfortable for the dwarves to live in. In front of each house was a small flower garden, planted with small flowers and plants. The flowers were blooming profusely, very beautiful. Although it was already late, it wasn't pitch black. There was still a soft light everywhere, like a summer dusk. In front of each small house hung a blue lamp, the light flickering like the neon signs of city shops. In front of each of the small houses stood a dwarf couple, but the dwarf women didn't wear blue clothes. Instead, they wore brown dresses, so they weren't as pretty as their husbands. When the dwarves saw Alice approaching, they bowed deeply, and the dwarf women also curtsied. Alice didn't dare to be negligent and returned their greetings all the way. She understood that the dwarves had specially invited her to visit their village and were treating her like an honored guest. She walked slowly, looking around, eager to satisfy her curiosity. A cool evening breeze blew on her blue robe, the corners fluttering, almost touching the roofs of the small houses.</p>

<p>— Xiang Jun</p>
<p>Recently, I had a friend come to Shanghai from the old capital, who told me in detail about the chrysanthemum scene there. Now I will summarize and record it below:</p>
<p>After Yan Juopeng returned to Beijing from Shanghai, he separated from Hou Yulan and collaborated with Hu Bilan, performing at the Guangde Theater.</p>
<p>After Shanghai actor Huang Yulin went to Beijing, he joined Wang Yaoqing's troupe and formed his own troupe, recently performing the entire "Feng Yupei" at the Kaiming Theater.</p>
<p>Ma-style Laosheng Li Shengzao performed the entire "Yi Peng Xue" at Qingle Theater on the 25th, with a very complete cast, including Qingyi Chen Lifang and Wusheng Gao Shenglin.</p>
<p>Wuchou master of the performing arts, Fu Liancheng, led Xiao Fangshuo, Ouyang De, Xiao Changhua, and Ma Fulu of the Fu Liancheng Peking Opera School to perform for the 24th time at the Xinxin Theater for the National Opera Revitalization Association. The program was the first two parts of "Ronghua Ji."</p>
<p>Jin Shaoshan performed the entire "Famen Temple" at the Guangde Theater, playing Liu Jin himself, with Guan Dayuan playing Zhao Lian, Tao Mocang playing Song Qiaojiao, and Jiang Miaoxiang playing Chuan Peng.</p>
<p>Since the death of Yang Xiaolou, only Sun Yukun is able to inherit his mantle. Mr. Xu Muyun previously wrote in "Liyuan Waiji" that it was a pity he had fallen, but now it is said that he has recovered. Recently, he has been the lead at the Jixiang Theater, with Wusheng Hou Xirui, veteran Laosheng Shi Huibao, and Qingyi Chen Shengsun and Li Guifang, performing Yang-style's unique masterpiece "Changbanpo Hanjinkou". It is rumored that a certain theater in Shanghai has invited him to come south to replace Wu Suqiu.</p>

<p>"He is a musician, not a boxer, please take good care of him." When Joe left home, his father said this to Lorna with great sorrow. This kind father, how much he cherished his beloved son, hoping that he could become a successful musician, and always warning his son, "Be careful with those hands!" However, Joe could not settle for poverty, he used his hands, which his father had entrusted with unlimited hope, to participate in boxing and earn huge sums of money. When Joe's violin could not produce harmonious sounds, Pennerpartite still encouraged him to play on! Play on! But his son gave him a resounding answer, and left!</p>
<p>In the two hours in the dark, I was deeply moved by this touching story! "Be careful with those hands!" This warning is for everyone who is hesitating on the wrong path of money and fame. Cai Ruheng's "He had to do what he didn't want to do before" was precisely because he misused his hands!</p>
<p>William Holden, who was originally a violinist, gave us satisfactory results in playing the important role of Joe. He fully demonstrated the emotional conflicts under the intertwining of the old father's urging, the temptation of money, and the suspicion of love. The "close-up" after he was heavily slapped by the hooligan Foxy Li revealed his deep expressions of anger, pain, and shame, which moved people to tears. Jacob, who played his father, helped the success of "Golden Boy" even more with his superb acting skills, such as buying a violin as a birthday gift for his son; warning his son to be careful with his hands; singing and dancing to stimulate Joe to play the violin; visiting Joe at the boxing arena; and finally embracing Joe and Lorna, the revelation of family affection, all movements and tones, grasping the emotional shift of this role. Others, such as White Belle Lan Stan Faye's Lorna, Adolf Meng Yu's Tom, and Jos Felia's Foxy Li, were also all dedicated.</p>
<p>Director Molmlin's amazing skills kept the film progressing in an exciting and tense atmosphere from beginning to end. He used two violin performances and then "copied" boxing to strengthen the psychological conflict of Joe's hesitations, making it even more powerful. The atmosphere of the last boxing match made the audience suffocate and unable to breathe. And after this climax, he turned Joe around in one breath. This cannot be achieved without a director with strong courage.</p>
<p>In short, "Golden Boy" is a beautiful work that has all the beauty of a script, actors, and director.</p>

<p>"Wang Baochuan" has been screened at the Great Shanghai Theater and has been a huge success. "Wang Baochuan" is the only Chinese film to have achieved such a result when released in a first-run Western film theater. The story of "Wang Baochuan" is well-known to both women and children, and it has been praised overseas. It is the Chinese drama that is most loved and understood by the general public. The directors of Yi Hua all say that the story of "Wang Baochuan" has a very strong dramatic element, and its description of the activity of feudal women is better than that of Zhuo Wenjun and Hong Fu Zhuan. Its ability to be so popular is not without reason.</p>
<p>Starting from the 28th, the Shanghai Guang Theater will also screen a new Soviet film "Children's Heroes". There are two songs in this film, written by the Soviet composer Dunaevsky and poet Lebedev-Kumach, who are familiar to Chinese people. One of them has been translated into Chinese by Yang Fan and Chen Gexin. The authors' "March of the Motherland", "Farmer's Song" and "Fire Plough Song" were once popular in China.</p>

<p>Recently, Xinxin Company has specially invited the Wenbin Troupe to perform wonderful costumed Shenqu at the New Capital Hotel Glass Radio Station from 12:30 to 2:00 noon every day. The performances have been well received by the general audience since they were performed.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>One Northerner and One Southerner Honored</p>
<p>Lao Rui didn't have money to buy a coffin, so he borrowed a hundred yuan from his colleagues in the Pear Garden. He had to deduct ten yuan for interest first. I was so angry at the time that I repeatedly asked the company to lend Lao Rui three hundred yuan first to handle the funeral. After his voice recovered, we asked him to make records. From this we became close friends, and until now, he always comes to my residence every five or seven days to talk. The articles I published in this magazine have been going on for a year. Many people don't understand why I often praise the old actors and encourage or blame the younger actors. Today, I will take the opportunity to praise the two elders of Rui and Wang to briefly describe the reasons for my past relationship with the actors, so that it seems that I can still say a few words to blame them sometimes. However, very few of the recent actors can truly remember their roots, especially after they become famous, they look down on everyone. Speaking of this, I suddenly thought of an incident involving Dr. Mei and Elder Rui. Last spring, the widow of a deceased celebrity held a funeral at the Central Ballroom. Many actors went there. Lanfang, along with Li Feishu, Yao Yufu, Xu Lanyuan, Wang Shaoting, and Xiao Bo, went together. At that time, I and Lao Rui had already been seated for dinner. After Mei and the others arrived, the host asked me to entertain them on her behalf, so I had to sit down again. After a while, Rui had finished eating and wanted to leave. At that time, the lights in the ballroom were dim, and he was old and his eyesight was bad, so he couldn't find me anywhere. He hurriedly said goodbye and left alone. Who knew that Lanfang's eyesight was very sharp? Seeing Rui passing by his table, he immediately stood up and bowed to Rui with a very respectful attitude. (149)</p>

<p>— Xue Weihan Publication</p>
<p>Fourth Game - A Narrow Victory</p>
<p>Red Moves First to Win</p>
<p>This game is the 75th game in the first collection of the Xiangpu Daquan Zhuxiao Zhai. The original score is with the rook, scholar, and soldier versus the rook, scholar, and soldier. In my opinion, this game should be red to win. I hope the experts can correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p>Supplementary Note: (1) Contributions to this column are welcome, with a one-week limit. The first seven correct answers will receive a small reward. Please send your letters to No. 3, Liuhe Village, Moliere Road. (2) The winners of the previous issue are Tian Haiping, Bao Hanliang, and Weng Zhenyuan.</p>
<p>Discussion: (1) Please revise your submissions to study the old chess endgame. It is meaningful to change Xiangxi Gou Xuan to change the orange secret chariot and artillery to red first and draw. It is of little value to change the chariot-horse invincible to the single-wheeled chariot game of the orange secret into the black first and draw, which is an example. (2) Although Zhuxiang Zhai is subtle and profound, it is complicated and has many errors. It seems that the orange secret is more suitable for beginners to refer to.</p>
<p>Message: (1) I heard that the national player Mr. Zhou Deyu has news of coming to Shanghai. Those who want the Xiangxi Gou Xuan chess manual can write to the Hong Kong Huazi Daily for Mr. Zhou to bring it over and purchase it on his behalf. This is inappropriate. (2) Weihan is unable to teach chess skills. I am willing to introduce famous players for you to benefit from.</p>
