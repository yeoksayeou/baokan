<p>社評</p>
<h3>芬蘭問題</h3>
<p>昨天本報檢討了蘇聯近日的行動；現在請就芬蘭問題再論列一下。</p>
<p>芬蘭問題當然離不開波羅的海問題。試打開地圖一看，在波羅的海的東部有一個凹進約五百公里的芬蘭灣。芬蘭灣的北面就是芬蘭國；南面則由北而南順次排列着愛沙尼亞，拉脫維亞和立陶宛三小國；蘇聯被鎖在芬蘭灣東方的裏端；而另一個西方的外口却橫臥着由大小三百多島嶼合成的亞蘭羣島。這亞蘭羣島不但控制了芬蘭灣，同時也控制了整個的波羅的海，因為波羅的海好像一個丁字，而亞蘭島恰在丁字的三叉點上，—現在這羣島的主權也屬於芬蘭。</p>
<p>再把第一次世界大戰前的地圖翻開來看，我們就知道芬蘭和三小國的地方都是帝俄的舊壤。俄國革命後，她們先後宣告了獨立，列强爲防止蘇聯社會主義力量的發展起見，就在民族自決的原則之下，贊助她們獨立。使蘇聯與波羅的海隔離起來。如果說列强有意給波蘭一條通海的走廊，那末無疑的也是有意祇讓蘇聯剩有極短的海岸臨着芬蘭灣。而且戰後到强爲嚴密防赤起見，旣資助了德國使之復興，同時也曾經慫恿着那幾個新興的波羅的海國家，組織反俄陣綫，替其他國家担任了防赤的前哨任務。</p>
<p>蘇聯是一個社會主義的國家，對於民族獨立當然並不反對；但是一向控制半個波羅的海的俄國，現在祇保持了芬蘭灣裏極端可憐的一角、這未嘗不是一件窒息難堪的事。而且即使這幾個新興國家本身不會威脅蘇聯，但是列强假手於她們給蘇聯以威脅，未嘗不是意料中事。例如亞蘭羣島最初是屬於瑞典的，後來才被帝俄奪去、等到大戰以後、瑞典想要求歸還這羣島，列强却靳而不與，祇准給予芬蘭，使在反俄陣綫上多起一點作用；起初這地方是規定不設防的，但是最近芬蘭却擬在這地方設防，列强都很加贊助，獨蘇聯却感到重大的威脅。所以蘇聯對於這幾個新興國家，雖然並不一定要翦滅她們，但也未嘗不希望减少對本身的威脅。</p>
<p>目前波蘭問題旣已告一段落，三小國與蘇聯訂的也次第完成，那末波羅的海方面就祇有芬蘭問題沒有解決了。蘇聯的過於要求芬蘭談判，原因就在這裏。然而蘇芬談判的形勢却顯然和三小國大不相同，好像非常緊張的樣子。例如芬蘭自身就深具戒心，代表巴西基維剛才出發赴蘇，而芬蘭境內已有了軍事準備，好像預料到談判一定會決裂的；又如北歐各國聽得蘇芬談判，也皇皇然不可終日，恐怕芬蘭一旦屈服，瑞典挪威丹麥都會感到了脣亡齒寒的危機；再像那遠在西半球近來在行動上毫未干涉歐局的美國，却又不憚詞費地勸告蘇聯切勿藐視芬蘭的獨立。這些現象可以表示着芬蘭的獨立不但她自身非常重視，而且國際間也特別重視。這爲什麽呢？原來芬蘭的地理位置與立陶宛等三小國不同，三小國的疆域目前已包在蘇聯的境內，所以她們的運命和國際間的關係較少，獨立與吾已與人無涉，中立更無從談起；至於芬蘭的疆域却不止和蘇聯一國接壤，她的命運可以影響到別國，所以國際間不但需要她獨立，並且還需要她中立。再則，芬蘭的確是俊秀的民族，他的民族意識比較强烈，國力也比較充實，目前的軍事準備雖然也許是示威的性質，但也很可能的引起一種新的糾紛。還有一點，芬蘭問題旣爲波羅的海的最後問題，當然芬蘭問題的解決，就是蘇聯對波羅的海控制力的加强，這在一向疑懼蘇聯的國家看來，實在是一件極可憂慮的事。總之，伴着蘇芬談判而起的緊張狀態，不外是國際間錯綜心理的表現罷了。</p>
<p>蘇芬談判的前途如何，我們不必多加揣測，但在芬蘭方面需要保持獨立和中立，蘇聯方面需要減少對自身的威脅，這兩方面的願望並不是沒有圓滿解決的途徑可循，兩國當局大的不會見不及此吧！</p>
<h3>歐洲和戰臨緊要關頭　德蘇義將舉行三國會商　柏林澈夜會議研討作戰計畫　和議被拒德表露憤激與不安</h3>
<p>柏林　據國社黨方面昨晚消息、因希特勒和平計劃之失敗、德國將立卽與蘇聯義大利舉行三國會議、商討「共同防禦事宜」、德國現在唯一目的、即為與英法決戰獲得勝利、而使歐洲和平行以恢復、希特勒昨日整夜與其　員以及海陸空軍人員會議、商討繼續作戰計劃、權威方面昨晚聲稱、蘇聯人民委員長莫洛托夫與義外長齊亞諾即將抵柏林、開始三國會商、決定以軍事方法使戰爭停止之方案、德官方稱、英首相張伯倫在下院之演說爲對德國之一種侮辱、德政府權威發言人仍吾認謂和平無望、僅謂希特勒之國會演說中、即要求各喜愛和平者對此答覆、截止今日、尙無任何答覆、德政府當亦不能再爲久候云、（十四日美聯電）</p>
<p>荷京　英法兩國總揆相繼發表演說之後、荷蘭各報多謂德義蘇三國即將進行談話、「電聞報」載有駐柏林訪員來電稱、「德國政界人士咸謂、依照德義兩國暨德蘇兩國所訂條約、德義蘇三國當在短時期內、甚至在四十八小時以內、在柏林進行政治軍事談話、蘇聯代表或由外交人民委員長莫洛托夫任之、義國代表則由外長齊亞諾任之、德國各報仍復攻訐英國、謂其應負延長戰事之責」、「電聞報」幷謂、「昨晚柏林方面充滿憤慨與不安氣象、但又認爲局勢尙未至山窮水盡、仍望各中立國能於最後一分鐘出面斡旋、俾克避免大禍、</p>
<p>此外、蘇聯在波羅的海沿岸擴展勢力之後、德國官塲人士極爲焦念、咸認爲德國利益已受妨害、波羅的海沿岸原係德國勢力範圍、今茲縱未完全失去、但已不得不聽任强鄰分嘗一臠、德國外交部方面雖云、波羅的海沿岸所發生之事故、該國並不感覺興趣、此固無可奈何、聊以解嘲、其實該國海陸軍界人士均極憤激」云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>蘇聯對德　經濟援助情形　經濟協定範圍狹小</h3>

<h3>金融　美英滙兌又進四元　投機出英金進美滙　美匯收盤已至七元五角　滙豐維持英金鬆後重回　連日貼現低落致緊一因</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、仍無上落、英美滙暗市、因默洲局勢、經英法拒絕希氏之和平建議、世人深信和平已屬無望、致使海外英鎊（交戰國）重吿慘落、曾　晨價三元九角六分三釐牛、低至三元九角四分五釐二、計狂瀉七分半之巨、而本市投機商、及某外行有利曁外電等、均塞出英金、來勢洶湧、幸賴滙豐竭力維持、吃胃之宏、可謂罕有、據聞曾向某二外行力吸二十餘萬鎊之巨、一呼百應、反引起其他行商聯袂扒進、而沙遜及津帮買意、亦油然而起、故價乃大緊、收盤美滙則爲七元五角、而英金亦已緊至四辦士五六二五、至期貨趨勢與現貨同途、祇聞有扒美滙、而無英金、父遠期（十一月）英美滙兌三元　角二分七釐二、半天交易暢旺、蓋自連日貼現低落以來、現　籌碼充斥、向之因現鈔短少、而不能投機於外滙市塲者、今乃復得活動、是以公債市塲交易反淸、（公債買賣皆用滙劃）、而外滙買風又起、日來滙價轉緊、貼現率之低落、不爲無因也、</p>
<p>英金午刻買風轉盛</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期長半辦士、遠期則無榮辱紐約銀價暴漲一分一二五、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美·對滬·對法均平、美對英縮七分半、對滬降五分、對法小三分八七五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士六五六二五、美滙七元六八七五、較之前收、英鬆〇三一二五、美則反軟〇六二五、乃滙兌下縮之故、開後雖美行力塞英金、兼外電與投機商亦吐售英金、但因滙豐吃胃非常濃厚、市面反稍帶緊、計滙豐吃進某行外電及投機商現貨英金四辦士六五六二五及六二五、（聞爲數頗鉅）、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉續大二分七五、此後投機商因鑒滙鹽吃胃如此之旺、致亦紛紛止售反扒、加之西商沙遜與洋行界及天津帮等莫不爭先扒結、是以情况愈緊、計沙遜華商天津帮及洋行等結進外行大通華比有利某行現貨英金四辦士六二五及五六二五、並現貨美滙由七元六二五、緊至半元、同時投機家又扒進某行有利本月份美滙七元五六二五、及十一月份美滙七元四三七五與三七五、時已午刻、午收銀行現貨賣價英金四辦士五六二五、美滙七元半、本月份英金四辦士五三一二五、美滙七元四三七五、十一月份英金四辦士四六八七五、美滙七元三一二五、結果較隔昨、現期英均緊〇六二五、美俱軟二五、掉期續見拔開、午後週六無市、</p>

<h3>外滙軟化　金市繼續向榮</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、承上日餘威、及外匯晨間報軟之故、繼續上昇、惟漲勢有限、開盤卽抬至叫千零二十元、惟金號帮力塞、氣燄始得稍殺、一度回至三千九百九十八元低盤、嗣因證券帮忽代客帮買進、且外匯緊軟、再引起一般塌便宜貨者拖入、致四千零二十八元高價於收盤之前再現、而收盤價則爲四千零二十三元、結果較上日軋漲三十五元、聞收後錢兌業亦曾代客帮扒進、午後塲外最高價巳見過四千零四十五元、及至最後因銀樓帮及散戶傾吐、卽回平至四千零二十元、照午後外滙結價、以英金四便士五六二五計算、合四千三百九—元左右、（計撳的三百七十元）、美滙七元半計算、合四千六百七十元光景、（的撳六百五十元）、所撳較上日爲多、蓋有某金號力售所致、半天交易尙旺、的七百兩光景、銀樓飾金先漲後跌、終則未更、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤出四千元關</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開承上日餘威、兼以外滙軟化、一般代理人呌喊聲極振、而賣方討價殊昂、開市竟猛抬三十二元、銀樓帮進錢兌業十兩、爲四千零二十元、開後某金號忽來猛塞、且銀樓帮及散戶亦止扒爲賣、少頃即回小二十二元、某金號賣予錢兌業三十兩、爲三千九百九十八元、嗣因外滙續報緊軟、買老漸多、而賣戶見勢觀望、時證券帮拉提頗力、復抬高三十元、證券帮進錢兌業二十兩、價爲四千零二十八元、此後某金號復起賣風、兼散戶及現金號亦獲利了結、雖某錢兌業代客收買、但一時頭寸仍感寬裕、不久再回小十三元、金號互做三十兩、及錢兌業進銀樓帮二十兩、價均爲四千零十五元、午刻賣風稍戢、漲勢重振、遂又拉高八元、某錢兌業進金號四十兩、爲四千零二十三一元、作午收價、結果較上日軋漲三十五元、查已連升二天共漲八十三元、聞收後某錢兌業吸胃愈健、又抬起十餘元、某錢兌業進同業十兩、價爲四千零四十元、下午週六交割例假、聞塲外仍稍有做開、最高爲四千零四十五元、某金號及錢兌業售出、終見回低至四百二十元、現金號之本牌金、售便照烚赤高四五元、收進比售出低三十元光量、現標金收售照牌金低五十元左右、未聞成交、</p>
<p>首飾金先漲後回</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百零五元、迨至下午一時五十二分掛高五元、後至四時零五分回小五元、終則無變化、大同行仍懸四百零五元原價、新同行與上價相同、收進均約減小二十元光景、</p>
<h3>證劵　又傳和平　公債再漲　外股交易熱狂</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、初則　續下跌、午後謠言又多，漲風復起、在午收後即有中日停戰謠言、明知捕風捉影、但市况適在連跌兩日之後、人氣又爲之鼓動、且頗有掉換種類、交易大都均爲出丙進其他各種、且大戶漸有吸收頗有重整旗鼓之象、和平空氣若再稍加濃厚、前途或有第二度之漲風也、昨日經過、交易因週六關係、比較爲遜、進戶以二十號一貫宗旨、仍有吸收、大豐及松茂進胃亦不弱、但天生永康出籠仍多、鴻大同康亦傾向賣出、故午收尙小去三四角、收盤後謠言突起、人心頓轉、故午後交易亦較旺、大慶大生等掉換交易頗形熱鬧、而需要乙種者獨多、聯益協大買進、及散戶補空父形熱鬧、賣方比較爲弱、丙戊種又衝出七元關乙種竟上達九元、檯面又成易漲難跌之象、市價結果、除丁種因下午未曾做開外、計尙小去四角、餘則均已回漲三四角至九角、成交總數的計六十元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交紗布易所股五十股、價為四十元零二角半、比前又堅云、昨日衆業公所市况、續形活潑、瑞鎔股猛漲至十四元、尤爲其中特色、牠種股票、無大變化、一般人興趣頃已普遍擴張至整個市塲、橡皮股成交數亦甚可觀、</p>
<p>下星期一之交割、將爲碩大無比者、市塲爲專一計、屆時停止上午交易、下午二時半開始照常拍板、</p>
<p>倫敦十三日電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、古拉客林傍橡皮股電跌二便士、爲十五先令七便士、其餘平平、</p>
<p>倫敦十三日、今日中國外債掛牌行市、趨勢平穩、上下檔各債劵、概無上落、</p>
<h3>外幣買氣又盛</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、繼續挺進、初因滙豐銀行對英美滙突有吃胃、並以天津帮及沙遜等亦相繼爭扒、致潛勢甚軟、金市經港帮力購後、因亦復出四千元大關、凡此均足以助長買氣、故美金票初即高至十三元二三角、後更步昂至五角二分、其餘各幣漲勢亦勁、午後市上忽傳同盟社傳出消息、英大使寇爾氏於飛蓉前、曾與王外長晤談、該社認爲英使又有調解中日戰爭之說、以致買氣頓吿消滅、市勢以致稍轉軟化、美金票卒以十三元四角二分爲最後價、結果高漲三角二分、英金鎊亦升五角、金票高七角、美金元漲一元、法郎票大五釐、新加坡票昂一角半、坎拿大票高三角、日金票趨勢亦堅、卒爲一元三角六分、比上日計升一分二釐、朝鮮票甚穩、價仍站一元一角五分七釐、餘俱不動、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗市徘徊　大戶續有出籠　實銷祗賴粗紗</h3>
<p>紗市微見上升、趨勢依然乏勁、大致不脫徘徊之境、人心大都看好、惟實銷遲滯而無生色、香港帮採辦幾爲十支·十二支粗紗交易、然額子微乎其微、內地帮亦進粗紗、其他帮口絕無舉動、就大勢情况測之、非待客銷發展、市面恐難有新姿態、茲據市塲言、某大戶繼續賣出、然數量不及昔日之鉅、大概將下篷轉舵、又有一說謂囤積之貨太多、暫時出籠、風險當可减輕一些、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因大雨傾盆、滿衢積水盈尺、交通不便、到會者甚遲、相延至十時方才做開市盤、二十支雙馬價爲七百二十元、漲五元、少頃同業購買再升四元、但實需仍呆、又復下降、中途無甚變化、大致呆木無精神、查半日成交統計九百十包、上日成交二百二十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲六元、其他與上日相仿、今日有棉紗五十件運海防、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　一四〇　同行　六〇〇</p>
<p>內地　一四〇　寗波　三〇</p>
<p>統計　九一〇</p>
<h3>棉花交易　華廠停頓</h3>
<p>本棉交易依然沈寂、華廠採辦停頓、至於日廠需要益覺零落、上海廠稍有交易、進常陰沙打包花四百件、略爲點綴外、其他無大舉動、通州花銷路尤爲淸淡、但售價尙屬穩定、與上日不相上下、蘇北來源、計通州花一千五百九十包、北沙來二千一百六十包、出口今日有六百六十五包運香港、茲將現棉情形例左、</p>
<p>通州　一三四·〇〇　同業　一〇〇包</p>
<p>常陰打包　一四一·五〇　上海　四〇〇包</p>
<p>平果爾　一二一·〇〇　鴻章　二〇〇包</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、昨日滙兌較緊、棉價每擔漲起三五元不等、同業間心意因而轉堅、然廠方對於原棉之採購、仍屬淡薄異常、同業昨日會訂購美棉五百件、可供紡二十支之用、惟爲十二月份裝、價格殊爲廉宜、按照目前滙兌計算、祇合一百七十餘元云、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初因受同業購買之踴躍、市况殊爲平庸、後因有南方帮之套賣、市况即形轉疲、結果收盤價格、除近期不動外、遠期較之上日跌落二三磅音、印度棉市殊爲堅挺、昨日連同預測漲起五羅比餘、埃及跌十餘磅昔、利物浦漲四便士、</p>
<h3>糧食　秋雨成澤國　米價堅定</h3>
<p>秋雨傾盆、江潮高漲、全滬幾成澤國、故米市買客亦寥寥、河下旣無到貨、車輪運來包子僅四千餘包、故雖交易稀少、而客家心思頗堅、破礱新粳容種百哥以及羊蘆變元價悉守原盤、客尖因隔昨提高之餘、茲際銷滯、遂現軟勢、有貶低二三角者、計統市成交數僅三四千包、常錫破粳市無高貨、祇做開中市者三十元、宿次者二十七八元、蘇同崑高破三十元、二十九元、次二十七元、新粳二十七兀七角、至二十六元七角、顓橋老破新粳二十三元、靑角窰種二十九元、白稻二十八九元、楓嘉百哥特二十八元、市二十七元半、二十七元、中二十六元半、羊尖特二十三元二角、次至二十一元、蘆尖特二十三元半、次至二十二元、江北尖十八元八角、至十八元五角半、蕪尖特十九元三角次至十八元、充機尖十七元半、砶尖十七元、南京特尖十九元六角、次至十八元半、變元陳三十一二元、三十元、新一十六元半二十六元、</p>
<p>昨風在雨暴中、客秈交易頓形淸淡、實銷本客深恐裝運受濕均爲停辦、浮戶散囤亦觀望不前、而輪棧被雨浸水之受潮貨、莫不急於貶價求晚、新米質地較次、雖經換袋仍難久擱、而上下兩市塲中到客甚稀、供過於求、市價立見回降、高檔小二三角、中次受潮者小三四角及六七角不等、成交不足二千包、到頭仍有近四千石云、</p>
<h3>回籠粉售價　超過廠盤　綠砲車七元一角半</h3>
<p>麵粉　自客銷活動以來、南北兩帮雖無大宗去化、而零銷迄未見衰、市上棧單貨籌碼日枯、麥市亦見上展、人心一致轉堅、惟値週末之期、交易並不鬧熱、廠方亦不願大量供給、聞綠砲車售價超過廠盤已達七元一角五分、紅藍車及紅藍福新牌祇有廠貨零批本街、廠盤仍爲七元、父聞日廠鳳凰牌盼大漲、價由六元六角漲至六元八角以上云、今日出口麵粉有一萬零三百包運天津、</p>
<p>小麥　近日產價高昂、販戶减少、及洋麥來源、經難通劃、賣戶心理頗堅、一味扳持、惟廠家擇巧而取、囤戶亦不亟亟需求、故市面愈擯愈僵、結果竟無正式成交云、</p>
<h3>雜糧　豆蔴回疲　生油到貨尙多</h3>
<p>兩日來芝蔴黃豆市面、俱吿下游、蓋因各路到貨源源而來、且大都中次居多、刻下各帮銷塲、取高提决殺宗旨、良以在高貨匱乏之下、辦胃尙少興奮、昨市芝蔴交易比較其他尙見熱鬧、計開揚州蔴七百包、價自二十六元三角至二十八元零五分、漢口蔴三百包、價爲三十一元、南京蔴一百九十餘包、價爲三十一元及三十元零八角、蕪湖蔴三十包、價爲三十元、黃豆祇成交太倉豆一百包、價爲十三元、十二元九角、蕪湖豆二百包、價爲十三元一角至十二元五角、</p>
<p>生油昨日自天津運來二千六百四十件、又六千三百聽、今日出口至香港者一千一百聽、又一百五十件、豆子今日運津三百包、芝蔴三百包、</p>
<h3>糖市　白糖續升</h3>
<p>糖市據荷蘭電、產價又升、即裝粗白價已升至荷質九·八〇、故公會劃盤再度上展、漲起一元至一元數角不一、現貨二四粗白本棧五十一元半、二百包、外棧五十二元半、三百包、五十二元三角、四百包、轉口貨四十元五角半至七角、太古車白東棧B嘜五十六元三角、西棧五十六元七角、CW嘜五十六元二角、CX嘜五十五元七角、DY嘜五十五元二角、HX嘜五十四元七角、H嘜車赤三十九元至三十九元半、荷赤復出四十元關、為四十元半至四十一元、本綿白振記一號五十二元半、二三四號照退、本冰升元半、一號六十四元、晶明冰六十五元半、國糖聞靑赤糖暗盤已有成交一二百包、價較便宜、但未詳悉、</p>
<h3>市况彙誌</h3>
<p>新濟南桃肉近以乏到、市勢甚俏、査市存極缺、故較高者行盤呌一百四十元、次之一百三十元、比首市開價須升二三十元云、</p>
<p>滙劃票據貼現率、昨始高繼即回平、每千元初為六十元、一度步高至午刻爲六十五元、下午仍爲原盤、比前日高七元半、錢業公會拆息勿更、早午兩市均掛一角九分云、</p>

<h3>侵佔滬西營造廠　偽同盟軍設本部　四處張貼荒謬佈吿標語　途人無辜因探望遭毒刑</h3>
<p>越界築路區域某方組織所謂「特務隊」後、前日又佔據曹家宅六六號、組織所謂「和平同盟軍」、在滬西一帶、張貼爲某方張目之標語、昨晨突侵佔白利南路二五〇號（憶定盤路口）之桂記營造廠、設立「軍本部」在門首掛一木牌、上有「和平同盟軍常英部隊本部」字樣、並在附近各要道發貼「佈吿」、內容全係擁護某方荒謬主張、至前佔之房屋、則已改爲該軍之「訓練處」、兩處均有武裝人員守衛、若輩所穿之「制服」、與「特務隊」相仿、亦係綠色、惟顏色較深、所戴軍帽、係圓形、與日軍所用者相彷彿、布裹腿、黃膠鞋、裝束較「特務隊」略爲整齊、據聞前日有錢姓中年男子路過極司非而路某隊部門前時、因好奇竚立向內探望、被守望隊員瞥見、不問情由、將其拖入屋內、在呢帽中搜出防空須知一張、後竟小題大做、誣爲奸細、從事審問、雖經嚴刑拷打、未有供詞、僅稱因帽太大、故用該紙加以襯墊、並無他意、嗣經錢某關係人聞訊、挽人說項、化去法幣百五十元、始得釋出、</p>
<h3>昨晨豪雨傾注　滬市空前大水　全部雨量三英寸八二　適値商潮風向又不利　溝水倒灌馬路成澤國</h3>
<p>本埠昨晨豪雨暴注、適値高潮、加以東南風甚緊、海水激盪入浦、溝水倒灌、馬路到處一片汪洋、水深處可行舟楫、其泛濫之廣、較之上次颶風襲滬高潮猝發時、水勢有過之無不及、可謂本埠近來空前未有之大水、據上海電話公司某重要職員聲稱、竟有一處之電話綫、遭受損害、即在蘇州路以甫、寗波路以北、圓明園路以西、江西路以東之地段中、的有電話用戶二百個、不能享受電話服務、但該公司已趕速修理、大致於今日即可完全恢復原狀、昨午後天氣轉晴、而氣候悶熱異常、馬路積水、以高潮關係、迄晚猶未退盡、各情如下、</p>
<p>雨勢殷驟　實所罕見</p>
<p>昨晨在雨、起於前日午夜十一時一刻、比至昨晨六時一刻、至七時三刻間、雨勢之急驟、實所罕見、在此時間內所降雨量、據徐家匯天文台紀錄、已得八十五公糎、</p>
<p>八時以後　雨勢趨緩</p>
<p>上午八時起雨勢稍緩、至九時雨點略住、總計自前日午夜開始降雨起、至昨日上午九時止之所降雨量、爲九六·六公糎、折合英寸爲三英寸八十一、雨勢傾注之驟、可以概見、</p>
<p>昨日全部　所降雨量</p>
<p>昨日上午九時半起、雨點雖繼續下注、惟勢已疏落、至十一時許始行休止、續降雨量為〇·五公糎、據徐家匯天文台紀錄、總計昨日全部雨量爲九七·一公糎、合英寸爲三英寸八十二、</p>
<p>馬路到處　一片汪洋</p>
<p>因豪雨傾注、陰溝流瀉不及關係、馬路到處積水盈溢、如南京路·浙江路·廣西路·英華街·白克路·愛文義路·甘肅路·武定路·福煦路·薩坡賽路經極司非而路·愚園路·杜美路·霞飛路·等處、莫不一片在洋、水深處可以沒膝、</p>
<p>浦江高潮　助紂為虐</p>
<p>查昨晨零時十五分鐘、黃浦江適有高潮、其數量在小二英寸五分之間、去外灘駁岸密邇、當昨晨雨勢急　時間、潮水尙未退落、因之浦江水位幾於並岸、馬路陰溝開始冒水、地面積水遂形泛濫、</p>
<p>車輛交通　均遭妨礙</p>
<p>昨晨大雨中、路上行人稀少、商店門庭冷落、交通方面、因馬路積水成渠、公共汽車及電車均减低速率、排水行駛、間有因水勢過深而致停滯者、霞飛路電車道昨下午尙未駛車、私人車輛及人力車等迴旋水中、彷彿泛棹波心、蔚爲大觀、馬路上行人終日均須借助車輛、雖咫尺間隔、亦藉人力車擺渡、汽車則多數油箱浸水、沿途拋錨、平民踝足涉水而過、行路靡不興嗟、</p>
<p>天氣轉晴　積水未盡</p>
<p>昨日午後起、陽光普照天氣轉晴、惟馬路積水、則迄晚猶未退盡、揆厥原因、緣昨日午後一時零二分、浦江高潮續發、數量仍達十二英尺、潮水從陰溝倒灌、致地面積水無由宣洩、查今日浦江尙有高潮、故低窪馬路之積水、難期退盡、又昨日雨後氣候悶熱、最高溫度爲八十五度半、且氣壓趨低、天氣致有變化、</p>
<p>電車停駛　交通多斷</p>
<p>昨晨六時後、照例各路電車及公共汽車即出廠營業、因雨勢猛烈、車廠多被水淹、公共租界先施公司門前及法租界善鐘路一帶、水深仍述數尺、卡德路　坡賽路積水最深、故一二路有軌電車、均吿停駛、僅數路有軌電車未停、但沿途十分之五六、均在水中行駛、</p>
<p>酣臥水中　援救不及</p>
<p>江陰人張晋朝、年二十三歲、向在滬西惇信路通容鐵工廠爲小工、前晚張在廠作夜工、迨工作完畢、即在該廠席地而臥、昨晨暴雨驟注、該廠亦爲水浸入、頓成澤國、而張晋朝因工作過勞、疲倦異常、酣臥不醒、浸在水中、昨日上午十時許由另一工人瞥見、呼之不應、即上前將其扶起、已不省人事、氣若游絲、急雇車將其送紅十字會醫院、未及抵院、已氣絕斃命、美領將設宴款待</p>

<h3>滬西偽警察　謀接管交通燈　大批中外巡捕得訊馳往　偽警見勢不妙當即撤退</h3>
<p>字林報云、「特別市府警察局」警察、昨（十三日）晨十時四十分、在憶定盤路西重要十字路口、强令公共租界警務處印捕關閉交通燈、致在此兩交叉地點暫起混亂、幾肇事端、至靜安寺捕房加派巡捕、馳往該兩地點、而「特別市警察局」終將引起爭執之警察撤退、其事始寢、茲誌詳情如下、</p>

<p>昨日大雨　偽警狼狽</p>
<p>僞警方面、前日曾企圖攫憶定盤路愚園路及憶定盤路大西路之交通管理權、昨日兩處崗位雖為水淹沒、捕房仍加派有探捕、分別駐守、以資防範、至愚園路地豐路口、水深沒脛、駐防該處之偽警、爲雨水所浸、赤足躱於店門傍之窗攔上、情形甚爲狼狽、</p>

<h3>攝影術發明者　達蓋爾百年紀念　震旦大學開影展　陳列郞靜山作品</h3>
<p>— 記者</p>
<p>最近十年來，國人對於攝影的嗜好，有普遍的發展，研究攝影技術的團體，各地都有，很有許多馳名世界的作品。</p>
<p>發明攝影術的人，其功績實不亞於愛迪生，馬可尼，然而愛好攝影的人們，或有不知攝影術爲誰所發明者，豈非異事？我們敬愛愛迪生和馬可尼，我們對於發明攝影術的達蓋爾，尤不得不致佩仰之忱！茲値達蓋爾發明攝影術百年紀念，應先介紹達蓋爾其人。</p>
<p>達蓋爾Daguerre,　Louis　Jacques　Mande是法國人，於一七八九年十一月十八日生於—Cormeilles，Seine-et-oise，他本是一個畫家，一八二二年，在巴黎開了一個透視畫院，於倫敦也設了一個。到一八二六年，達氏方與Niepce共同硏究攝影術，未幾，他獨自硏究，經過十三年苦心孤詣的工夫，方吿成功，至一八三九年，始公開於世，到今年適爲一百年。達荒爾於一八五一年七月十二日故世。達氏當時听用的底片，是一種金屬片，後來經過無數人的發明，始從金屬片而玻璃片，更至於今日之膠片，然而我們溯其發明之源流，自常歸功於達蓋爾先生。</p>
<p>震且大學攝影研究社，爲紀念達蓋爾發明攝影術百年紀念起見，特舉行郎靜山攝影展覽會。郞氏的作品，富有畫意，亦富有詩意，他所採取的章法，都和諧而美妙，令人見了好像看到一幅畫，這是中外人士所一致欣賞的。</p>
<p>郎氏最近游西甫歸來，在各省所攝名影凡一百餘幀，（已由中國旅行社印行西南攬勝一册，昨日在震旦大學會塲發售，）都全部放大，送入震旦展覽會，我們大家都憧憬着西南活躍的姿態，現在看了這許多名作，宛如身在西南，而西南潛在的全貌，也一一顯露於吾人之前。</p>
<p>昨日午後，這展覽會舉行開幕，雖然路上盡成澤國，但是赴會的仍極踴躍，的有三百餘人。下午二時，震旦大學院長才爾孟神父致簡短演詞後，即山福開森博士演說，老福先生說巾國話，大家都能懂得，他說：「我們不僅應該景仰達蓋爾發明攝影術的偉大，應該努力去學達蓋爾的硏究精神，現在，唯有郎靜山先生有這種精神，所以他能够有偉大的成功。」</p>
<p>這幾句括，引起全塲熱烈的掌聲，無疑地，郎氏眞可以受之而無媿！郞氏爲英國，荷蘭，比利時三國皇家攝影學會會員，又爲美國攝影學會會員，曾得世界各國攝影展覽獎賞五十八次，中國之受此榮譽者，郞氏爲第一人。現在將郎氏所發表的紀念文字，摘錄於後：</p>
<p>余於攝影，髫年時即深感興趣，常思宇宙事物之影象，能使之傳遠存久，而復逼眞當時情景者，舍攝影術莫由，蓋此種存象，較之文字圖畫之描寫爲眞確也。先君七十年前之結婚照片，當時情景，今猶宛然可覩。</p>
<p>今歲蜀中之豐收，其出產可供十年之需，雖以天賦膏腴，而水利之功亦絕大，其水利工程，爲數千年古法，今因利用攝影，而得供各國人士之易於硏究參考。其他類是之道，可得攝影之助，而廣爲流傳或硏討者，正不可勝舉。由此可知攝影之於社會及各種學術之關係至巨也。</p>
<p>邇來世界各國，美術攝影，鑽硏日精，能於刻板之紀象作用外，別求情趣，由機械的而化爲藝術的，其進步又足驚異，而所採構圖理法，亦多與吾國繪事相同。如凑合數種底片，滙印一張，若吾國畫家之對景物隨意取舍者然，而造成理想之新境地，其法一也。</p>
<p>顧攝影雖已進於藝術之域，非僅烘私人之娛賞，亦以文化爲歸墟，故對於工業，醫學，尤多努力供獻其功能。總之，任何科學之發明與促進，務須以人類幸福爲鵠的，方有不可磨滅之價値。以此復令人追思先哲達蓋爾氏攝影術之發明，因其發明，而得入今日精進之域，厥功殊偉。今値公布氏攝影術之百年紀念，又届震旦攝影硏究社三周之期，承震旦大學院長屬將余所作攝影，在此公開展覽，藉資紀念，榮幸無似。爰定十月十四日在震旦新厦禮堂，舉行開幕式，敬希各界大雅，蒞臨示教。翌日發售門劵，悉數充震旦攝影硏究社推廣醫學硏究攝影儀器之用。十一月一日起，另行展覽五日，門券所獲，以之救濟內地難胞，惟杯水車薪，無補萬一，區區微意，幸各界垂察焉。</p>
<p>展覽會今日公開參觀，不過只此一日，各界人士，想不會失此機會的。</p>

<h3>怎樣訓練腦子</h3>
<p>— 萍</p>
<p>人們的做事，全憑兩手和大腦，腦子是個接受感觸和發動反應的機關，也就是全身的總司令，一個人的成敗智愚，對於思想的靈敏與否，大有關係，許多發明家，政治家，軍事家，文學家，那一個不是憑他智慧的腦子，創造出許多偉大的事業，例如前綫作戰的軍事領袖，倘然沒有聰明的腦子，就不能决算於千里之外，其餘如掌理內政的大政治家，他如果沒有正確的思想，把國家弄得烏烟瘴氣，全國的人民，都要蒙着不利。以上舉出的例子，都是關於國家民族的大問題，其他對於個人的，那末因一念之錯，而致畢生莫贖的，這種事情，可以說是比比皆是，一個人身體不能健全，果然是一件不幸的事，倘然思想不健全，更使你要受到莫大的痛苦，照這樣說來，我們應當要怎樣訓練我們的腦子才是。</p>
<p>一個人在呱呱墮地的時候，他的腦子都是純潔的，沒有一點不好的思想，那末社會上爲什麽有盜賊呢？這般人，就是他的思想的變壞，甘願做犯法的事。誰願意做壞人？我可以說沒有的，不過耍防止思想的變壞，只有從早訓練腦子。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們的腦子，都是純潔的，但是爲什麽有的聰明，有的笨呢？因爲有的肯訓練他的腦子，有的不肯訓練罷了，不過小朋友一定要問我，腦子怎麽樣訓練的呢？</p>
<p>訓練腦子，並不是件困難的事，我們只要多讀書多寫文，對某一件事，有不明瞭的地方，多加思索，不耍不懂了，就去請教老師，我們要使思想正確，不耍歪曲，某一件事不能做的時候，無論人們的甘言利誘，你要拿出堅决的意志，揮之門外，而某一件事應當做的時候，即使斧鑊加身，赴湯蹈火，也應當不顧一切的去做。自古以來，不少忠臣和奸佞，都在他們一念的差別，小朋友年紀尙小，將來爲國家所負的責任正大，應當要怎樣的訓練好你們的腦子，使它健全，正確，聰明，因爲你的一生的幸福，完全繫在它身上，訓練腦子，要自小訓練起來，年紀大了，是沒有用的，愚笨的小孩子，應當積極訓練，就是聰明的小孩子，也要訓練成一個特殊的頭腦，以便將來幹一番轟轟烈烈的大事業。國家的前途，和你個人的幸福，關於腦子，是很重大的。</p>
<h3>虎</h3>
<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>老虎被獵人追捕，中了幾槍，受着重傷。它一面流血，一面逃走，獵人在後緊緊追着。不久，它到了一座懸崖的邊上，眼看着無路可走，生命到了危急的關頭。忽然，它瞥見懸崖下面的草原上，有一對可愛的小虎跳躍着，定睛一看，正是它的兒子們。它大嘯一聲，正要跳下崖去，死在它兒子們的身邊，就在這時候，聽見了獵人的脚聲，沿着一路上的血跡，越打越近。它这時如果跳下崖去，恰巧領導獵人發現自己的兒子。但，如果不把獵人咬死，獵人遲早也會發現自己的兒子的。爲了保護自已的後代，它不再自殺了，它要奮鬥。</p>
<p>它疾忙仰臥在草叢裏，忍住呻吟，屏住呼吸，保存着最後一點精力。一會兒，獵人搜尋到了它的身邊，它一躍而起，與獵人搏鬥，鬥了許久，虎與人一齊倒地死了。</p>
<p>它的兒子們依然在草原上活潑的跳躍着，一點也不知道他們的母親，已經爲了保護他們，英勇地戰鬥而死。</p>
<p>在道大時代裹，我們不但要不怕死，而且應該考慮，怎樣死才更有意義。</p>
<h3>進城</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>—明兒避難記之三十八—</p>
<p>刮了一晚的風下了一天的雨，大氣中的溫度便隨着風的吹個不休雨的下個不停而降低了不少，陽光早被雨雲遮蓋得透不過氣，有時從雲間探出頭來，可是在霎時間又不見它的影跡。到得風吹過了，雨下停了，滿空潔淨得似碧玉一般，那陽光嬌嫩的射到大地上，也减低了它的溫度，人們的身上時常感覺得冷氣的刺激，那時已是十二月的下旬，將近國曆新年了。怪不得氣候是要冷下來。明兒在那村子裹總算悠閒的度過了一個多月的安樂日子，沒有飛機，不見兵士，外界的事不聞不知，每個人安份守已的度着日子，眞是人間的安樂窩，亂世的桃花源。不過外省貨物的價錢，是飛漲得很貴了，而在附近幾個村子裏的土產，在明兒眼中是冉便宜也沒有—蕃　一角錢十斤，鷄蛋一元六七十隻，柴炭一元三四百斤—因此明兒是天天吃鷄蛋，早也是它，晚也是它，實在有些吃厭了。</p>
<p>很幸運的過了兩天淸朗和暖的日子，可是好景不常，接着便是陰　的天氣，整日的不見陽光，氣溫便更冷了許多，那分明是雪，正在準備下降的預兆。凡是空中一切的熱都被雪收了去，而更能統制了熱的散播，把烏雲重重的封鎖住了熱的發源地。它更發動了風的暴力，在光禿的樹梢怒吼着，盡力的把那餘留下的熱驅逐到千萬里外，這一切的景象，是下雪的前奏曲。</p>
<p>「下了雪，到那裏去買菜呢？」這一個問題是在明兒母親心中焦急着，因爲在過去的一個多月中，在房東太太常送菜給他們和向鄰家苦苦的讓買些菜蔬之下支持了這許多日子，總算可以敷衍過去。如今伊眼見得這將下雪的氣候，便很要緊急的解決「食」的問題，因爲這問題是挺重要的，怪不得伊老人家要着急了。</p>
<p>四下裹打聽了一下的結果：在離這村子十多里外的縣城裏可解決「菜蔬」的問題。於是在一天的下午，明兒和他的哥哥提着籃子，拿了繩子，父親提了手杖踏上了進城的大道。在平時，採辦菜蔬，總是女僕們的事，可是在逃難的時期裏，親自的拿着籃，到遠迢迢的城裹去買菜，這是他們父子三人的生平第一這。</p>
<p>眼前，身旁，背後，腿的兩面都是碧綠的豆田，滿地的　豆，一行行排列得很齊整，而一塊塊的田畦劃分得也很淸楚，道條路是鑲在這阡陌的田岸中間。這十多里的路程，在一個鐘頭左右被他們三雙腳踏完了，便踏進了城。</p>
<p>那縣城是很破舊的了。矮小的城牆上，雉堞很零落，而枯萎的野草更密密地把牆身遮藏了起來，似乎塗上了一層蒼老的色彩。石條的道路，高低不平的，偶一不留神，便有把脚嵌在石縫裏的可能。他們雖已進了城，行人寥若晨星，而居住在縣城的人們也好像怕他們一般的躱在家裏，不敢出來。</p>
<p>拐了兩個灣，便是二十多級的石階，很不費力的走完了這石階，地勢是陷落得多了。原來那城牆是築在小丘上整個的縣城的地勢是很低陷，很像是盆地的模樣，因此那城牆只須造得這樣矮小，已足够了，然而在城中仰頭望去，郤是巍然高大的。</p>
<h3>藍矮子（四）</h3>
<p>— 哀黎</p>
<p>伯父笑着，逐一回答了阿立的問話，但是阿麗却站在沙發旁邊，很莊重的對伯母瞧著，悄悄地問道：「伯母，你且正正經經地回答我的話，世界上到底有沒有一個矮子國啊？」原來伊剛才聽着伯母向阿立解說的話，認爲是一種敷衍，生怕阿立以後見了矮子要害怕，所以有意說得那麽平淡無奇的。伊先前原曾讀過地理，知道北歐有拉泊蘭人和芬蘭人，都生得很矮小，倒也可以算得是矮子國，但不知道在這裏附近的森林中，有沒有矮子們住着，因爲地理書中從沒有說起過這回事，伯母年紀較長，以前也曾到過這裏，應當知道得很淸楚的。况且伊剛才明明親自瞧見一個矮人走過窗外，說不定正有像他一樣的許多矮子，住在那邊森林中呢？而那瓷器中所做的藍矮子，也許就是借他們做標本的，最好去證實一下，那才有趣哩。</p>
<p>阿麗暗暗地想道：「據阿立的猜想，那些瓷器廠中的藍矮子，也許照着眞的矮子而做成的，下次我倘走過森林時，倒要留心瞧瞧，究竟有沒有矮子住在那裏。」</p>
<p>這些思想，在阿麗心中波動着，伊的兩個眼睛，便注定在伯母的臉上，很鄭重的問道：「伯母，你說矮子眞的是人類的一種嗎？」伯母正色道：「是的，我爲什麽騙你。這個問題我們一不用再提，快把一切東西收拾起來，你伯伯已把車子預備好了。」</p>
<p>伯父接口道：「是的，已預備好了。阿立，但是對不起你，這車兒並不是一輛牛車，因爲我們須得快一些趕路，決不能坐着牛車，在森林裏慢吞吞地走呢。我所預備的車子，是一輛挺好的馬車，趕起路來是很快的。但我們趕了一二小時的路，也娘停一下子，一方面也給那些馬匹休息一會，餵些東西給它們吃，不然，今夜就不能再趕路哩。」</p>
<p>伯母提了包裹和行囊，同着阿麗阿立走到門外去，一面問道：「你說半路上要停一下子，打算停在那裹？」伯父道：「在森林中段有一個小小村子，那邊有人會照料馬匹的。就是我們自己也得小坐一下，喝一杯咖啡，我記得以前曾到過這一個美麗可愛的小村子，如今倒也很想留連片刻呢。」</p>
<p>阿麗正側耳聽着，不由得自言自語道：「森林中一個美麗可愛的小村子！那所在也許和矮子們住的所在很接近，就是離開這裏也不遠，剛才我們不是已瞧見了矮老頭兒嗎？」</p>
<p>他們一行人旣上了車，那車夫加上一鞭，車兒就向前進行了。那時雖在午後，天氣還是很熱，而開始的一段路，也平平淡淡的，沒有什麽興味。到得後來，路上漸漸開曠，到了野外，而走入一片很大的松林，阿麗這才快樂起來，忙問伯父道：「伯伯，這可是一個挺大的森林嗎？伯父略有倦意，隨口答道：「是的，很大很大。」以下就沒有話了。阿麗抬眼看時，見他和伯母都沈倒了頭，似乎將要入睡，而阿立却早已在車身顚動中睡熟了，但是阿麗却很興奮，並無睡意。　（未完）</p>
<h3>猴與眼鏡</h3>
<p>—克里洛夫寓言—</p>
<p>從前有一個猴子，年紀老了，眼力不好。他聽得人說：「這種不幸是沒有多大關係的，只要有一副眼鏡就好了。」所以他拿了半打眼鏡來，把眼鏡顚倒反覆的看，這面張張，那面望望。一刻把眼鏡放在他的頸上，一刻父把眼鏡放在他的尾巴上。嗅了幾嗅，舐了幾舐，眼鏡對於他的目力仍舊沒有用處。</p>
<p>猴子喊道：「唉！爲什麽那些蠢東西，要聽無聊的人所說的話呢？他們所說的眼鏡，沒有別的，祇是說謊罷了！」於是他拿眼鏡向石頭上一丟，丟得粉碎。</p>
<p>我們說東西不好，其實是我們自己沒有明白。（趙易林譯）幫忙的效果</p>

<p>游藝界　毛澤東　藍蘋</p>
<h3>結婚非事實</h3>
<p>— 裴斐</p>
<p>前個月罷，路透社電傳毛澤東將在渝與女藝人藍蘋結婚，當時會轟動全滬，一般人都引爲政界韻聞與藝壇軼話的。</p>
<p>關於藍蘋（眞姓名爲李雲鶴）嫁給毛氏的消息，在上海首先傳出來的，實際並非路透社；遠在兩月以前，專撰「劇壇外史」的瞿史公，早在中美日報的電影與戲劇週刊上露過這個消息。前後兩者所傳的消息，不同的是：瞿史公說藍蘋已與毛澤東同居，而路透社則謂毛澤東將娶藍蘋。</p>
<p>最近據友人從陝北來函云：上海所傳「已經同居」或「將要結婚」等等消息，都是不確的。</p>
<p>他說：「藍蘋和毛澤東相當接近是事實，但結婚云云是談不到的。原因和理由是：第一，毛澤東是個所謂「有婦之夫」，共產黨是厲行一夫一妻制的他身爲此間行政領袖，決不會幹這「性的混亂」之事；第二，藍蘋和毛澤東都是意志很强有理智底人，他們也不會像一般人容易玩戀愛把戲。</p>
<p>「是的，也許有人以爲「無風不起浪」；那麽，消息怎樣會誤傳的呢？事情是如此的：過去藍蘋是膚施紅軍抗大的學生，毛澤東在這個學校里曾任「唯物史觀辯證法」的教授之職，他們是因師生關係而相識的。後來，藍蘋畢業了，去任魯迅藝術學院的女生指導，因爲她求智慾旺的緣故，常到毛澤東那兒去討教些學問，而在這時凑巧毛夫人賀子珍女士跑往蘇聯進莫斯科大學深造去了，一般近視的人們看見他們常在一塊兒談話，就不加思索的放出兩人談愛的謠言來了。…」</p>
<p>那位朋友是在那邊某學校担任藝術指導的，並且他和藍蘋還是很熟的知交，他對於藍蘋的事，不消說是知道得一定很淸楚的，所以我深信他在信上所談的話完全是事實，才敢把它摘錄在這裏，藉作闢謠的</p>
<h3>梅蘭芳的私生活（三）</h3>
<p>— 李斐叔</p>
<p>—梅邊雜憶之六—</p>
<p>梅先生個性之溫和，從這幾個例，便可看出了。他見人說話，有時囁嚅若不勝言辭者。但是他論事觀人，胸中極有主宰，對人則外無圭角，更不妄事論人長短。能受善言，尤爲其致名之因素。無論是對於處世立身，或是關於藝術方面，恭維他的話，他倒不一定聽得進，規過勸勉的話，他確有從善如流之概。凡是稍稍接近他的朋友，對於這一點，都交口稱譽的！</p>
<p>他做事，有勇氣亦有毅力。雖然有許多事，是仰仗朋友輔助而成的。但是他是個軸心，也可算是原動力。他如果意志不堅定，他的朋友們往往會因爲許多的困難而半途中止的。從前的游美游俄，經過了多少的磨折！要不是他一往直前的精神，維縏住各人斷續的意志，那末梅先生這一生的事業，我敢說「百無一成」。</p>
<p>他的求知慾，比普通人來得旺盛。無論對於那一件事物，他必很細心的硏尋其眞理，必至洞澈其微奧而後已。尤其是對於戲劇，他能不恥下問，精益求精。天性向上，所以走到今日這個地步，友朋的督促，還在其次。</p>
<p>總之，他的個性，很合於詩人之旨。（溫柔教厚）待人接物，則謙恭有禮。對於藝術，則戲劇可算是他的第一生命，維護灌溉，不遺餘力。至於他個性的疵病，亦不是完全沒有。如遇事過於謹愼，則未免近於優柔寡斷。待人過於忠厚，則近於闇弱，易爲人欺。這裏篇幅有限，恕不贅述了。</p>
<p>新片介紹</p>
<h3>血洗黑嶽記（續）</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“Each　Dawn　I　Die”</p>
<p>全片除了最後的越獄的大塲面之外，幾乎完全在描寫詹姆士和喬治賴甫德的因激於正義而結爲好友，及喬治賴甫德的豪爽剛直，不惜以生命爲詹姆士洗寃。有幾塲戯都很精緻，激盪。如：（一）詹姆士接見母親及未婚妻的時候，喬治賴甫德前後兩次逼視的「特寫」（二）喬治賴甫德越獄後，詹姆士堅小吐實；及在工塲中描寫各個犯人的動態等。喬治賴甫德開庭逃獄那塲，也很動人：先寫紅十汽車及另一輛汽車的停在法庭外面；喬治賴甫德被拍照時的驚愕；詹姆士在窗口遙望時的驚愕；汽車喇叭的暗號；喬治賴甫德從高樓上跳下紅十汽車，再跨入另一輛汽車……每一個鏡頭都很激盪。</p>
<p>最後越獄，在密集的機關槍聲中，喬治賴甫德的力逼波里特凱供出謀害詹姆士的經過，等獄長答允之後，喬治賴甫德强曳波里特凱衝出門去，而同死於彈雨之下。一種窘息的氣氛，强固之至。</p>
<p>詹姆士賈克奈仍保持過去的成績，含寃莫白，堅不吐實等幾塲都演得很好。喬治賴甫德演「小生」的時候，旣欠漂亮，而生硬的動作，更使他沒有什麽成就，在本片中，因適合個性的緣故演來非常沉着有力</p>

<p>申報　星期增刊　第七期　國際動態</p>
<h3>國際局勢急激演變中的土耳其　英法集團向之竭力拉攏　蘇聯亦願與之握手言歡</h3>
<p>埋頭苦幹巳非近東病夫</p>
<p>歐戰後新興的土耳其，由於她的近十多年來的發憤圖强，國內的政治日漸進步，及經濟建設日趨繁榮，她已儼然成爲近東的重鎭。西歐列強，如英法已不當她為近東的病夫，拿她作為他們的經濟殖民地，而另眼相看，竭力與之拉攏，且不惜與之訂立互助協定：假使一旦土耳其有遭受歐洲侵略國威脅的時候，英法可以出而拔刀相助，這意義並不是講西歐大國如英法等，眞的有愛於集體安全，爲援助弱小民族，不惜冒戰爭的危險，以與侵略者周旋，保持所謂國　正義；而是講，土耳其在地理上跨歐亞，扼黑海通地中海的孔道，如果這樣軍事重耍地帶，一旦被一個强有力的黷武國家如德國所控制，德國的勢力，由東歐伸張，通過巴爾幹半島，而達於韃靼尼爾海峽，如上次大戰中一樣，這不但足以威脅英法近東殖民地的安全，並且還有控制蘇彝士運河，把殖民地遍世界的大英帝國，攔腰切斷的危險。爲了這原故，限制不准設防的韃靼尼爾海峽，到了一九三六年，土國政府也能援用情勢變遷條款，要求在海峽一帶設防，經過了蒙特婁會議，土國終於獲得了這頃目的，造成了英法蘇土在地中海上合作的先聲。到了今年三月捷克被德國滅亡，及隨後意大利佔領阿爾巴尼亞後，軸心國家的勢力，有席捲巴爾幹而直趨伊士丹布（前君士坦丁堡）之勢，於是英土又在五月有互助協定的簽訂，法土有桑甲克問題的解決，及成立互助協定之舉。這一切都足表示土耳其在他的現領袖伊士美領導之下，獲得外交上極大的成功。</p>
<p>現總統伊士美氏的政策</p>
<p>伊士美爲凱末爾的獵承者。他的名字爲伊諾雨（Ismet　Inouu）他生於伊士美爾（Ismir），他的姓氏，也與這地方有關因為他曾在一九二二年冬大敗希臘軍於此，所以得了這樣光榮的姓名。他和他的前任者凱末爾一樣，是爲土耳其革命，土耳其的自由而奮鬥，是領導民衆向一確定的活躍的和建設的方向邁進，以完成土耳其的文化建設。他的外交政策，是「與集體安全發生密切關係。」他又說，「集體安全政策，無論如何變遷，仍爲這動盪時代中的救藥，爲我們建設理想世界中較好的唯一基礎。」</p>
<p>土蘇英法的外交上關係</p>
<p>土耳其的與英法簽訂互助協定，我們可以說，也就是這種理想的表現。近牛年來，土耳其與英法有互助協定的簽訂，當然是與英法的邦交極爲親密。不過土耳其是介於蘇聯與英法之間的國家，過去蘇土的外交，也極爲親善。我們知道，凱末爾的自安哥拉率領國民軍抗拒英法，擊敗希臘，獲得蘇聯的援助不少。目前蘇德邦交趨於親密，而土耳其與英法接近，這在蘇聯是不能安心的一件事。當今英法對德作戰之時，蘇聯深恐土耳其有允許英法海軍通過韃靼尼海峽，進入黑海，破壞巴庫油田，或進攻蘇聯黑海沿岸領土之舉。蘇聯自有要求不准交戰國軍艦通過上述海峽及謀與土保持良好關係，締結互助公的的必要，土耳其爲謀其自身安全及與英法保持良好關係，同時也有耍求獲得蘇聯承認英法土的互助公的及與蘇聯協定，鞏固地中海東部和平的必要。所以土外長薩拉哥格魯這次有莫斯科之行。土外長與蘇聯談判的結果，據聞蘇土間的防守協定，業已簽字，此的規定土耳其封鎖海峽，以換取蘇聯對巴爾幹的担保爲條件。土耳其這樣外交上的新收穫，或可使她不致捲入戰爭的漩渦，保持她的雙方善意的中立吧。</p>
<p>時人小傳</p>
<h3>曾為上海英駐軍總指揮　英前方總司令　戈特子爵</h3>
<p>— 修基</p>
<p>英帝國參謀長戈特子爵，於九月四日被任為英軍前方總司令。戈將軍生於一八八六年，現年五十三歲，為戈特伯爵之第六代後裔，歐戰時為陸軍大尉，身先士卒，殊建勛蹟。一九一八年九月，於波羅斯吉附近作戰，胃敵方砲火，率隊進攻，曾受二彈負傷，但戈將軍不之顧，仍協友軍機械化部隊作戰，完成任務，以爵，於九月四日被任爲英軍前八八六年，現年五十三歲，爲爲陸軍大尉，身先士卒，殊建印度各地之陸軍指揮司令及陸軍學校校長等職。戈特將軍善射獵，好游泳，亦爲快艇選手。一九三三年，更獲飛行航空執照，爲優良之飛行家。戈特勇敢善戰著名。一九二七年，戈將軍率領英軍冷川衛隊來滬，任上海英陸軍駐滬總指揮之職，曾一度赴日。旋歷任本國將軍，不僅爲陸軍人材，亦爲海空將材，當戈特任基茵巴勒仕官學校校長時，因其精力過人，生性猛烈，　看「虎」之威名，英陸相嘉其幹練，起用爲英帝國參謀長之職。今戈又改任英軍前方總司令。至其所遺職務，已由英國海外陸軍總監埃恩賽特爵士繼任云。</p>
<p>經濟常識</p>
<h3>波譎雲詭的　棉紗市塲</h3>
<p>— 龍生</p>
<p>棉紗的買賣，在中日戰前，並無所謂有現貨與棧單之分，棧單憑證，是現貨的代表，買到棉紗棧單，就可以持單出貨，偶然間，棉紗類中有某一種支數，（例如：六支，十支，粗紗，或三十二支，四十支等細紗之類，）遇到生產與銷費不能配合，即「求過於供」時，廠方供應，不能悉數解付，因有分別棧單塡號之先後，儘其早號客戶（即先購者）而最先派給之，如果客戶之持有遲號棧單，而欲要求廠方抄前派，以應急銷者，得出抽現費給每件十元至二十元，即能獲得所要求之棉紗矣，這是偶然的不常有之事。</p>
<p>戰後的上海特區，變成孤島，也變成了逃難鉅公的游資淵藪了！富豪們的錢，沒有出路？於是買金條，買外匯之外，更爭先恐後的拚命囤積紗，布或米，麥，雜糧！</p>
<p>去臘，今春的二十支棉紗，無論是金城，雙馬，天女，地球，金鷄等脾，都在四百元左右，各牌之間，至多相差一二十元，標金冉冉上升，外匯漸漸緊縮，棉紗原料，因本棉的來源被操縱和統制，看情勢非仰求於外棉的大量供給不可，囤積居奇的投機商人，看準棋子，乃拚命的囤紗了！標紗雙馬（因熱銷之故，大家意識，便認牠—雙馬—是標準紗了？）從四百多元而躍升到五百元的頂高峯了！廠方因爲開出棧單多，現貨分配感難應付，因有抽現須提高數十元之限制，同時市塲上的市儈，做起棉紗交易來，現貨與棧單分道揚鑣，各開行市，現貨之價愈高，而棧單之價愈低，現貨與棧單，本來是一而二，二而一者，居然晚輻背道而馳。這的確是孤島棉紗市塲上的奇蹟！嗣後（約端午之前）外滙黑市，因投機者的不顧國家利害，瘋在式的做多頭，猛烈買進，加之某方的套買搗亂，外匯（英鎊與美金）的縮風，不可遏止，銀行界被投機存戶的提現。付現。釀成非常嚴重的局勢！於是一聲霹靂，財部的「馬」電，突如其來！（馬電是限制存戶，提現以五百元爲度）端節後銀行開關一發表，投機存戶轉換目標，瘋在的囤購棉紗，滙劃貼現，因需用現鈔迫急之故，也飛躍不巳！（從六七十元躍到兩百多兀）</p>
<p>紗市打破五百元大關之後，有如脫韁之馬，一直向最高峯挺進不止，加之市塲謠言蠭起，非謂外匯平準委員會基金將用盡，即謂委員會將不予維持黑市，恐將發生「通貨膨脹」，種種謠言，不一而足，用法幣不値的謬說的惡意中傷，投機朋友，始可以趁火打刦，混水掏魚！二十支棉紗，而六百多元，而七百多元，尤其是申新第九廠出品的雙馬牌紗，因爲熱銷（港帮與川·滇·黔等帮，納胃甚宏，）而生產量較多（日夜出一百四五十個包子之故，價格尤爲俏利，天女，地球，特金城等脾次之。）唯永安的特金城品質較高。有時與雙馬並駕齊驅，有時較雙馬爲高也）現貨與棧單之價，背馳猛烈！例如現貨價七百元的話，棧單價，僅僅乎六百十廿元而已，這時紗證金每件三十元的例規，早經取消，（在五百元的時候，尙可通融，投機朋友，獲得不少的便利，做十件棉紗，有三百元的證金，就可以如願以償了。）棉紗押款，金融業亦不允承做了，（金融業承做紗押款時，大的照市做七折至七五折。）所以做現紗朋友，非要憑眞實的雄厚財力來顯顏色不可，起碼做十件的，須有七千餘元的本錢摜出，（市價最鋒利時，須完全現鈔，共餘大都是三七付款，即七成匯劃，三成現鈔的簡稱）否則免開尊口，至於有匯劃頭寸而無現鈔頭寸的投機商人，那麽另外有一種波譎雲詭的生意經方法，就是原來紗款，須現鈔一萬元的，改付完全匯劃，則須加一成，計一萬一千元，這樣也可以成交了。）</p>
<p>九月初歐戰一爆發，外匯雖然見長，紗價却依然擯持，依然俏利，這是投機朋友，從第一次的歐戰經騐而來，何况棉紗的原料—棉花—本棉旣被頑强統制，外棉來源，或將因歐戰而發生問題？（這是神經過敏！）於是父爭先恐後的囤購不已，加之香港的英。日對峙形勢和緩下來，棉紗去路，實銷異常熱鬧，紗的脚地更堅。各方爭購的結果，雙馬牌頂高峯，到達過八百八十元一件，（現貨）外行投機朋友，看市情有一千元一件的希望，又竭力搜羅現鈔拖進，不料老於此道的狡黠者，却停手而放野風，依附於日僞和平運動的黑影中幌動！大肆流言，說什麽近衛，陳誠，已飛抵杳港，談判中·日·和平，說什麽中·日·德·意·蘇·五國同盟云云，甚囂塵上！果然，黔技得售！紗價劇跌進八百元關，目迷五色的外行投機朋友，情急拋售，紛紛以七百三四十元賤脫。狡黠者又乘機買進，二三日後，和平空氣，消滅得無影無踪，外行投機朋友，一日之隔，蝕去幾萬元的數見不鮮，而狡黠的商人，却喜逐顏開，大腹便便了！自後因王外長的和平談話，雖然公債猛漲，外匯放長，標金暴落，而棉紗倒能够比較鎮定，波動並不過烈。目前雙馬現貨常站定於七百五十元左右，而棧單價已漸形軋攏，和現貨價相差，僅三四十元了。大槪外行的投機家，已知難而退吧？然而斯文所述，也可以窺見棉紗市塲的動態的一般極光怪陸離波譎雲詭之至了。這賭博式的大賭博黑市，何日能見到靑天白日，一掃而淸呢？「附註」現貨與棧單之別，是現貨出高價後，能立即出到外棧或廠方的現紗，倘賤價買棧單貨，那麽這張棧單要隔兩三個月或者甚而至於半年，方纔能出得到現紗。「現紗」的出貨條，並無特殊的憑證，也不過一紙棧單而已，祇於棧單上批明「現貨」或「現出」兩字，讀者不可不知。</p>

<h3>在砲火下活躍的　新安旅行團</h3>
<p>— 慈雲</p>
<p>這一羣軍事化的小丘八　在烽火中壯健長大起來</p>
<p>新中國的主人—孩子們在烽火中鍜鍊得更是茁壯健强了當七七蘆溝橋民族解放戰爭的砲聲怒吼起來時，我們新安旅行團底工作更是顯出緊張和繁重，這時剛在遼遠的塞北底綏遠做着宣傳工作，本來預定的路綫是向西北發展，因爲鑒於工作的重要性，所以向接近前綫的地方去加緊宣傳工作，就於去年六月里到了西安，那時漢口形勢頗吃緊，所以特地趕到武漢參加了保衛大武漢的工作，以後退出了武漢，向南國一帶進行宣傳，暫在桂林就駐紮下來。</p>
<p>在剛成立這個旅行團底時候，我們基本人員僅僅祇有十幾個人，但是經過了這樣遼闊的區域和久長的日子，我們從各地各方面吸收了許多優秀的孩子，現在共計有五十幾個：其中包括十幾個女孩子；這些孩子底年紀自最小的八歲起至最大十八歲止，根據了年歲的大小分兒童部和少年部二部。另外全團有三位輔導員年紀是二十餘歲了！這是超過了規定年齡的老團員担任的，再有一位顧問，他已是三十餘歲的人了，但他生活在孩子圈里是覺得頂高興的事的。</p>
<p>這個流浪的隊伍是分四肢集體的負責領導的：總務股負日常事務工作及經濟的支出；連絡股負連絡團員和團員間的連絡和對外一切交際事務；自我教育股這是這個流浪的孩子隊伍的特點，這是負全團的教育工作，以團員底識字水準而編成圖書組學習組；宣傳股這是全團最吃重的工作，負一切對外的宣傳事務，對內要不斷地準備宣傳材料；四股各設主任一人，並成立幹事會，並產生一總幹事，，一個顧問和三個輔導員僅僅是輔助性質，另外新近成立了西南工作隊，道是着重負責向西南各省做宣傳工作的；再有傷兵工作隊，這是專門負責慰勞服務於受傷的忠勇將士的；再有專門負責訓練幹部的部門，因爲工作範圍的逐漸擴展，所以要不斷地吸收新團員進來。</p>
<p>最近駐紮在桂林的生活程序表是這樣排定的：晨六點三十分鐘起身，全體練習爬山一小時，十五分鍊洗臉，這是在河邊舉行的，三十分鐘兒童部學習舞蹈；同時少年部舉行生活檢討會，檢討昨天的生活與學習經過，並決定今天底生活與學習；三十分鐘共同練習唱歌，十點鐘正吃飯，一菜一湯，因爲每天祇吃兩餐，十一點鐘各股工作開始，一點鐘年幼的兒童部吃稀飯，這是專爲兒童部設備的；一點三十分至四點三十分少年部到山上去打游擊，兒童部開始技術學習，技術學習；包括歌詠話劇活報舞蹈演講；再對調的到山上去打游擊或技術學習，五點鐘晚飯，晚上出外表演或作一天中尙未完成的工作，十時陲。</p>
<p>全團的宣傳方法計分電影話劇歌詠演講舞蹈活報漫畫標語壁報照片展覽軍民大會，這一切技術全是採取小先生制度，自己人訓練自己人，全團五十餘人包括了各項的人村，電影是用手幻燈的，歌詠活報舞蹈這些材料或者自己編排或者根據報紙雜誌刋物的材料。</p>
<p>在每星期日舉行同樂會時，集體的可以吃一點糖菓，並且在這會里要舉行自我批評，每個孩子全穿灰色的制服，好像一隊小丘八，因爲生活的確是軍事化了，當桂林遭受空襲的時候，我們就在山洞里作工作。</p>
<h3>現代戰爭中　最殘酷武器　毒瓦斯</h3>
<p>消滅敵方作戰能力　無形殺人防不勝防</p>
<p>二次世界大戰又在開展中了那被人們目爲最利害的殺人利器—毒瓦斯—又將大肆厥威，給予人們，尤其是戰士們，以絕大的威脅和痛苦，這却是可以斷言的，毒瓦斯爲甚麽這樣利害，道樣可怕呢？原來別種武器的殺人，是有形的，是有法預事防範的；可是毒瓦斯的殺人，却是無形的，是防不勝防的。別種武器，離然霎時間可以殺人盈野，但是一經掩埋，即可了事，毒瓦斯却是襲擊人們身體上最柔嫩而無保障的部份，如肺部與眼鼻咽喉以及皮膚等。雄赳赳的戰士們，一經中其毒害，遽成毫無能爲之人，輕者在數分鐘或數小時內，飽受痛苦，重則遭到極可怕的創傷，非經長時期的醫治，不克痊愈。戰士們在這種不死不活的情形下，不獨喪失了戰鬥力，並且使他們的統帥，因此而煞費心機，大受其累，因爲在作戰的時候，傷兵們的醫療給養，實在是最感棘手的問題呀！</p>
<p>上次世界大戰中所採用的毒瓦斯，的共二十二種，可混合應用者十六種；但是確實有效，並且便於大量製造，和大規模施放的，實際上不過數種。化學師們雖竭全力從事於新毒氣的發明，但在這次或將來大戰時，如果應用毒氣的話，當仍不外乎上次已經用過；並經證明確實有效的幾種。如就其性質，加以類別，的可分爲左列數種：</p>
<p>一·窒息性瓦斯，二·催淚性瓦斯，三·催嚏性瓦斯，四·灼膚性瓦斯，不過甲種瓦斯，兼有乙種或丙種瓦斯作用者很多很多，所以它們的類別，有時是很難劃分淸楚的。</p>
<p>窒息性瓦斯</p>
<p>道是致人於死的一種瓦斯，它能侵入肺中，使其發生充血和呼吸窒塞而死；這種瓦斯，以一九一五年時德國方面所首先應用的氯氣爲最著名。嗣以發明別種能致人於死的氣體，遂不復用。不過實際上氯氣仍爲製造別種毒氣的重要原料。即如福斯金毒氣（Phosgene），即由氯和一養化炭物中所製成。</p>
<p>催淚性瓦斯</p>
<p>具有極强烈的催淚作用，但並沒有毒的成份，所以用這種瓦斯，來對付沒有防禦的軍隊，實在是最妙的方法。而且只要施放少許，即已足够使大衆受其困擾，所以也是最經濟合算的一種瓦斯。</p>
<p>催嚏性瓦斯</p>
<p>這種瓦斯的使用，在迫使對方連連噴嚏嘔吐，不得不將防毒面具除下，然後乃繼續施放別種毒氣，予以嚴重的或致命的打擊。所以這種瓦斯，不啻是掃除障碍的先遣隊，而它的使用，也就是實施眞正毒氣攻擊的先聲。</p>
<p>灼膚性瓦斯</p>
<p>計有兩種：一名芥子瓦斯，一名Lewisite，前者自大戰末期應用以來，至今仍享有「毒氣之王」的威名，後一種則雖有人擬以「死霧」命名，利用飛機來施放，但迄未見諸實行。芥子瓦斯，是用極平常的日用化學原料，如酒精硫磺及氯氣等製煉成功，無臭味，微量即有大效，能停留於地面及低窪處，達數日之久，中毒的人，初無若何不適，但實際上却已創鉅痛深。因爲這種瓦斯，有極利害的灼膚性，不論其爲氣體或流質，均能穿透衣服，使肌膚灼傷起泡，腫脹刺痛，疼苦異常。且極難於醫治，雖很輕微的創傷，亦須數星期方愈。重者更非幾個月不辦。芥子瓦斯不獨能灼傷人體，害及牲畜，甚且可以腐蝕機器，使其不克運用，它的損害力眞是偉大而可怕，芥千瓦斯對於眼與咽喉，並不致即刻發生影響；但在數小時後，中毒之人竟然可以雙目俱盲，非經過若干星期不能痊愈，施放少許芥子瓦斯，自然不易覺察，但不知只此少許數量，即已具有上述損害力和隨後發生的潛伏作用了。所以芥子瓦斯對於摧毀對方士氣，實在是各種毒氣中最有效的一種，無怪世人要尊稱它爲「毒氣之王」了。</p>
<p>奇聞奇事</p>
<h3>非洲的吃人樹</h3>
<p>— 新</p>
<p>在民國—二年的時候，報上曾經載有一段新聞，——非洲的吃人樹。茲以鄙人記憶力所能及到的，寫在下面：</p>
<p>住在非洲的日本人，每到夏天，總是組織一個團體，到非洲各地樹木茂盛的地方散步或游戲；藉以得到新鮮空氣，使身心愉快。有一年的夏天，住在非洲的日本人，依照往例，組成一個團體，往各處遊行。在出發的時候，他們點一點人數，帶了獵狗和麵包，向目的地進行，到了一處綠草如茵，樹木茂盛的樹林裏，他們唱歌，散步和休息。可是，回來時數一數人數，却少了一個人。雖然四出覓尋，倒底不能我尋着。及到民國十二年的夏天，有一羣的日本人，到那邊去遊行。當他們坐在地上休息時，有一隻獵狗，因爲口渴，想找些水來解渴，偶然看見一枝巨大的樹業子上有些　水，於是跑上去用牠的舌去舐吃。立刻那枝樹葉子就擾動起來，把那隻獵狗捲進業子裏。片刻，那葉子攤了開來，而那只獵狗却不見了。於是坐在地上的一羣日本人，方才知道幾年前失踪的一個日本人，是被那枝巨大的樹葉子吃掉的！</p>
<h3>世界筆會之全武行</h3>

<p>本年世界筆會在倫敦開會，會中因一位比利時代表觸怒了意大利代表，演了一幕全武行。意國代表曼納特氏站在意大利的立塲譏諷地說：「意大利不特歡迎法西斯蒂的作家，而且竭誠歡迎凡是同情於法西斯蒂之制度而不能積極地與之聯盟者。」比國代表皮拉得氏聽了這話，怒火中燒，兩脚跳起來，說：「是的，我們都知道意大利是一個羔羊之國，世界上除意大利外到處都是豺狼。」皮氏還舉了意大利著名哲學及作家克洛西爲例，謂法西斯蒂之警察如何搜查他的住宅，充公他的著作。曼納特登時跳上講台，飽之以老拳。卒由筆會會長以最高的權力鎭壓排解，此一幕世界文人之武劇始吿結束。</p>

<h3>Large Numbers of Chinese Aircraft Fly to Hankou; Three Bombing Raids on Japanese-Occupied Airfields; Hundreds of Bombs Dropped, Over a Hundred Japanese Aircraft Completely Destroyed; Ammunition Depots Also Hit, Explosions Continuous for Three Hours; Chinese Forces on Xiangbei Front Reach Dasha Ping in Southern Hubei</h3>
<p>Location Undisclosed. The glorious and magnificent war record of the Chinese Shenying (Divine Eagle) unit continuing its fierce bombing of the Hankou airfield on the 3rd of this month, destroying more than fifty Japanese aircraft, hundreds of barrels of gasoline, and killing over one hundred thirty Japanese airmen, on the 14th, once again using several [unclear] squadrons of Shenrui (Divine Sharpness) bombers, divided into [unclear] large formations, commanded separately by Unit Leader [unclear] and Unit Leader [unclear], carrying [unclear] tons of bombs, in the clear autumn sky, with an imposing array, directly targeted the Japanese air force assembly point at the Hankou airfield, which had been harassing the Chinese rear for days. When the Chinese aircraft arrived over the target, amidst the welcoming cheers of the people of the Three Towns, with a vast and orderly formation, they flew over the airfield, discovering two Japanese reconnaissance aircraft, which, seeing the Divine Eagles approaching, did not dare to engage and fled in panic. The first Chinese formation immediately aimed at the large group of Japanese aircraft parked at the airfield and the aircraft factory, calmly dropping hundreds of huge bombs. As dust and smoke rose, several fires were seen burning fiercely. The second formation followed, continuously dropping [unclear] tons of huge bombs on the main oil and ammunition depot, each hitting its target. The sound of the explosions shook the entire city. Instantly, flames soared into the sky and thick smoke covered the ground. Bombs exploded on gasoline, and the sound of falling explosions was as dense as a string of pearls. Gasoline caught fire due to flying shrapnel, and the blazing flames shot up into the sky. The third Chinese formation also targeted the airfield and various military facilities, frequently inflicting immense losses on the Japanese with [unclear] tons of huge bombs. The airfield occupied by the Japanese was almost completely turned into scorched earth. After completing their mission, the Chinese aircraft, amidst the cheers of the people of the Three Towns, flew wing-to-wing on their return journey. Suddenly, more than twenty Japanese fighter planes pursued to challenge them. The Chinese aircraft, with a dense web of fire, attacked them, driving the Japanese aircraft back from the vicinity of Yichang, and shooting down three Japanese aircraft on the spot. Two Chinese planes were also lightly damaged by Japanese bullets, but both returned safely. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing. Chinese air force heroes once again flew to Hankou on the 14th, launching a large-scale bombing raid on the Japanese-occupied airfield, inflicting a heavy blow before triumphantly returning. On the morning of the 14th, the autumn sky was high and clear, without a cloud in sight. The Chinese air force Shenying Brigade × Team officers and men, each with a full chest of enthusiasm and a calm attitude, took off from an undisclosed location, flew eastward, majestically traversing thousands of miles of beautiful mountains and rivers, heading towards their destination. After a while, the Chinese Shenying Brigade, amidst the jubilation of the people of the Three Towns of Wuhan, arrived over Wuhan. At that time, there were two Japanese fighter planes on aerial patrol. Suddenly, they saw the Chinese Shenying Brigade flying wing-to-wing, with a formidable military appearance. The Japanese aircraft, seeing the situation, were extremely frightened, dared not engage, and immediately fled. The brave Chinese air force did not pursue them, and instead divided into three groups of aircraft, advancing towards the airfield in sequence. At 12:13, the first Shenying aircraft group fired fiercely by Japanese anti-aircraft artillery, entered the airfield. At that time, there were many Japanese aircraft parked inside the field, numbering over a hundred. The Chinese officers and men then displayed their skills, fully exploiting the explosive power, and indeed, every bomb hit its mark. In an instant, the entire airfield was engulfed in flames, the raging fire soaring into the sky. Almost all of the Japanese aircraft in the field were burned to the ground. At 12:20, the second Chinese Shenying aircraft group calmly followed, entering the airspace above the airfield. After quickly finding their targets, they dropped a large number of explosive bombs. This time, the Japanese ammunition depot was hit by the Chinese in one strike. Immediately, thick smoke and dust soared into the sky. The ammunition inside the depot also exploded, and the sound of roaring explosions continued for three or four hours. At 12:30, the third Chinese Shenying aircraft group soared over the city of Hankou, aiming at their targets and dropping even more explosive bombs, thoroughly destroying the Japanese military facilities. Subsequently, more than twenty Japanese aircraft took off to intercept them, and fierce aerial combat occurred over a certain area. When the fierce battle reached its most intense point, five Japanese aircraft were indeed shot down by the Chinese. However, two Chinese aircraft were also hit and damaged, but they still safely flew near after repelling the Japanese aircraft. The Japanese aircraft pursued as far as the vicinity of Yichang, where they were bravely repelled by the Chinese. It is reported that the Japanese-occupied Hankou airfield was almost completely destroyed after being heavily bombed by the Chinese air force, and almost all of the aircraft parked inside the field were also destroyed. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing. According to a statement made by the Chinese spokesman today, Chinese aircraft bombed the Japanese airfield in Hankou in three waves today. Approximately one hundred Japanese aircraft were completely destroyed. The Japanese ammunition depot was also razed to the ground. The sound of explosions lasted for two or three hours. This is the second time in two weeks that Chinese aircraft have bombed the Japanese airfield in Hankou. The first time was on October 3rd. According to reports, the result of the large-scale bombing of the Hankou airfield by Chinese aircraft at that time was the destruction of fifty Japanese aircraft and a large amount of gasoline. The Chinese spokesman was so overjoyed that he wept when reporting this news to reporters. The first wave of Chinese aircraft bombed the Japanese airfield in Hankou at 12:13 this afternoon, blasting countless craters into the field and destroying many Japanese aircraft on the ground. The second wave arrived over the city of Hankou at 12:20, focusing on bombing the Japanese ammunition depot. The sound of explosions afterwards lasted for two or three hours without ceasing. The third wave of Chinese aircraft, the main force, appeared over the Japanese airfield and dropped hundreds of bombs on it. According to the pilots looking down, the Japanese airfield had been completely destroyed, and all one hundred Japanese aircraft on the airfield had been destroyed without remainder. When the third wave of Chinese aircraft completed its mission, twenty Japanese fighter planes arrived from other airfields and pursued the Chinese aircraft, engaging in aerial combat that continued until they reached a point two hundred miles west of Yichang, and can be described as the fiercest aerial combat since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. It is reported that three Japanese aircraft were shot down by Chinese aircraft, and two Chinese aircraft were shot down, with several others damaged. (14th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing. According to Chinese war reports, Chinese aircraft attacked Hankou three times today, bombing Japanese airfields and ammunition depots. All Chinese aircraft returned safely to their original defenses. The first wave of bombers appeared in the skies over Hankou at 12:13 PM, fiercely bombing the airfield and destroying many Japanese aircraft in the field. Seven minutes later, the second wave of Chinese aircraft arrived in the skies over Hankou, bombing the ammunition depot and causing it to catch fire and explode. The third wave of Chinese bombers, the largest in number, attacked Hankou at around 12:30 PM. However, details of this attack are not yet known. According to official sources here, the third and largest wave of bombers also bombed the airfield, dropping many bombs, causing large fires both inside and outside the field. Twenty Japanese fighter planes took off to engage in combat. They encountered the Chinese aircraft as they were flying upstream back, and fierce fighting ensued in the airspace between Hankou and Yichang. According to Chinese sources, at least three Japanese fighter planes were shot down, and two Chinese bombers were damaged. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing. According to Chinese telegrams received here today, after the Chinese army recaptured Yanglousi, an important station on the Yuezhou-Hankou Railway northeast of Yuezhou, this morning, they are now threatening the rear of the Japanese forces occupying Yuezhou and Tongcheng. Chinese military circles believe that the Japanese forces in southern Hubei may be forced to retreat towards Puqi. Chinese troops are advancing towards Yuezhou, while one Chinese force is attacking the east of Yuezhou, having captured Taolin, surrounded Yuezhou, and the Chinese forces attacking Tongcheng have completed the encirclement of the city. Another Chinese force bypassed Tongcheng and has reached Dasha Ping, north of Tongcheng and between Chongyang and Tongcheng. The main force of the Japanese army is currently retreating towards Puqi. The Chinese army in northwestern Jiangxi Province, after capturing Xiushui, is currently advancing towards Wu'ning, Fengxin, and Jing'an to protect the right flank of the Chinese army entering Hubei Province to the north. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha. Chinese forces on the Xiangbei front, one unit penetrating deep into enemy rear areas, encountered Japanese forces near Dasha Ping on the 12th and engaged in fierce fighting until the morning of the 14th. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties and retreated in defeat from Dasha Ping, relying on fortifications to hold their ground and daring not engage. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Miluo. Chinese forces attacked Xitang, northeast of Xinqiang Town, on the evening of the 13th, killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers and rescuing over a hundred Chinese women who had been captured by the Japanese army during the Xiangbei campaign, returning them all to their hometowns. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing. Since Yanglousi, on the Yuezhou-Hankou Railway northeast of Yuezhou, was recaptured by the Chinese side, the battle situation has once again changed. Because after Yanglousi was recaptured by the Chinese army, the Japanese army's land communications to the rear have been cut off. From now on, the supply of food and ammunition can only be done by water. At the same time, the vanguard of the Chinese army has already approached Yuezhou, so the position of the Japanese army there is extremely precarious. (14th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Miluo. A part of the Japanese Inaba Division retreating to Yueyang has suffered over two company casualties due to continuous attacks by the Chinese army in recent days. On the morning of the 12th, the Japanese used one warship and three motorboats to launch harassing attacks on the lake area around Lumugiumazui, but were completely repelled by the Chinese garrison, and the Japanese suffered many casualties. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Changde. According to reports from the front, the remnants of the Japanese army defeated in the Xiangbei campaign have been transported north in batches from Yueyang in recent days, seemingly to be transferred to the Wuhan area for replenishment and reorganization. It is reported that Japanese military trains have frequently been heading north from Yueyang in recent days. There were four military trains carrying Japanese soldiers and warhorses north. On the 12th, there were also two military trains fully loaded with remnants of the Japanese army heading north. Another part of the remnants of the Japanese army were transported to Hankou by water. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha. After suffering heavy blows in the Changsha campaign, the Japanese vented their anger on innocent Chinese civilians. According to a recent investigation, in just seven places, including Dajing Street, Changle Street, Xinshi, Pingjiang, Jinjing, Fulinpu, and Shangshan City, over five thousand residents were shot dead by the Japanese. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Gao'an. After the Chinese recaptured Cheping, southwest of Fengxin, they continued to besiege Fengxin. At 11:00 AM on the morning of the 14th, they successively recaptured Wubucheng and Balipu, ten li southwest of Fengxin. The Japanese in that area had four or five hundred soldiers, who stubbornly resisted. After the Chinese army bravely and fiercely attacked, they annihilated most of them. The remnants of the Japanese army retreated to Fengxin, and the Chinese army followed in pursuit, and has now reached the outskirts of Fengxin City, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin. Chinese forces in northern Jiangxi Province continued to recover the line of Cheping, Baita, and Maofenping on the evening of the 13th, restoring the situation before September 13th. Another unit advanced to Yangba Bridge and Qingba Bridge, continuing to search toward Cambodia. One unit is advancing towards Jing'an from the northeast. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Forces in Henan Province Break Into Southern Gate of Huaiyang</h3>
<p>Xuchang. A part of the Japanese army in Huaiyang, over three hundred infantry and cavalry, accompanied by two artillery pieces, rampaged in the Shihuiying area south of Huaiyang on the 9th. After the Chinese army fought bravely and fiercely, engaging in fierce fighting for three hours, the Japanese army did not succeed. In the afternoon, the Chinese army took advantage of the Japanese army's fatigue and launched a full-scale attack, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat, charging and killing four times. The Japanese army could not withstand it and retreated in disarray. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue, once breaking into the southern gate of Huaiyang, killing many Japanese soldiers. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Forces on Hainan Island Capture Two Strongholds</h3>
<p>Xuwen. Chinese forces on Hainan Island have been attacking Japanese forces for days, capturing many enemy soldiers. On the 3rd, Chinese forces attacked Meilan Wenling (southeast of Qiongshan) and other places. The Japanese army stubbornly resisted. After the Chinese army charged repeatedly, they broke into the Japanese army's position, engaging in hand-to-hand combat for two hours, killing many Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army could not withstand it and retreated in defeat. Meilan Wenling were successively recaptured by the Chinese army. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Finnish Question</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper reviewed the recent actions of the Soviet Union; now, let us further discuss the Finnish question.</p>
<p>The Finnish question is of course inseparable from the Baltic Sea question. If you open a map, you can see that in the eastern part of the Baltic Sea there is a Gulf of Finland that is indented by about 500 kilometers. To the north of the Gulf of Finland is the country of Finland; to the south, from north to south, are the three small countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania; the Soviet Union is locked at the eastern end of the Gulf of Finland; while at the other western outer mouth lies the Åland Islands, composed of more than 300 islands of various sizes. The Åland Islands not only control the Gulf of Finland, but also control the entire Baltic Sea, because the Baltic Sea looks like a T-shape, and the Åland Islands are located at the three-way intersection of the T-shape—and now the sovereignty of these islands also belongs to Finland.</p>
<p>If we turn to a map from before World War I, we will know that Finland and the three small countries were all former territories of Imperial Russia. After the Russian Revolution, they successively declared independence, and the great powers, in order to prevent the development of Soviet socialist power, supported their independence under the principle of national self-determination, isolating the Soviet Union from the Baltic Sea. If it is said that the great powers deliberately gave Poland a corridor to the sea, then undoubtedly it was also deliberate to only allow the Soviet Union to have a very short coastline bordering the Gulf of Finland. Moreover, after the war, in order to strictly prevent communism, they not only subsidized Germany to revive it, but also once encouraged those newly emerging Baltic countries to organize an anti-Russian front line, taking on the task of a frontline outpost for other countries to prevent communism.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is a socialist country, and of course it does not oppose national independence; but Russia, which has always controlled half of the Baltic Sea, now only maintains an extremely pitiful corner in the Gulf of Finland, which is not necessarily a suffocating and unbearable thing. And even if these newly emerging countries themselves do not threaten the Soviet Union, it is not unexpected that the great powers may use them to threaten the Soviet Union. For example, the Åland Islands originally belonged to Sweden, but were later seized by Imperial Russia. After the Great War, Sweden wanted to demand the return of these islands, but the great powers refused to grant them, only allowing them to belong to Finland, so as to play a greater role in the anti-Russian front line; initially, this place was stipulated as a demilitarized zone, but recently Finland intends to build defenses in this place, which the great powers have supported, but the Soviet Union feels a major threat. Therefore, although the Soviet Union does not necessarily want to destroy these newly emerging countries, it may still hope to reduce the threat to itself.</p>
<p>Now that the Polish question has come to an end, and the agreements signed between the three small countries and the Soviet Union have also been completed one after another, then in the Baltic Sea region, only the Finnish question has not been resolved. This is the reason why the Soviet Union is excessively demanding negotiations with Finland. However, the situation of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations is obviously very different from that of the three small countries, and seems to be very tense. For example, Finland itself is deeply wary. Representative Paasikivi has just departed for the Soviet Union, but Finland has already made military preparations, as if anticipating that the negotiations will definitely break down. Also, the Nordic countries, hearing about the Soviet-Finnish negotiations, are also in a state of anxiety, fearing that once Finland succumbs, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark will all feel the crisis of "when the lips are gone, the teeth are cold." Furthermore, the United States, which is far away in the Western Hemisphere and has recently not interfered in European affairs in its actions, is sparing no effort to advise the Soviet Union not to despise Finland's independence. These phenomena can indicate that Finland's independence is not only highly valued by itself, but also particularly valued internationally. Why is this? Originally, Finland's geographical location is different from that of the three small countries such as Lithuania. The territory of the three small countries is currently included within the territory of the Soviet Union, so their fate and international relations are less involved, and independence and neutrality are out of the question. As for Finland's territory, it does not only border the Soviet Union; its fate can affect other countries, so the international community not only needs it to be independent, but also needs it to be neutral. Furthermore, Finland is indeed a handsome nation, with a relatively strong national consciousness and a relatively strong national strength. Although the current military preparations may be demonstrative in nature, they may also cause a new dispute. One more thing, since the Finnish question is the last question in the Baltic Sea, of course, the resolution of the Finnish question is the strengthening of the Soviet Union's control over the Baltic Sea, which is a very worrying thing in the eyes of countries that have always been suspicious of the Soviet Union. In short, the tension accompanying the Soviet-Finnish negotiations is nothing more than a manifestation of complex international psychology.</p>
<p>We do not need to speculate too much on the future of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations, but on the Finnish side, it needs to maintain independence and neutrality, and on the Soviet side, it needs to reduce the threat to itself. These two wishes are not without a path to a satisfactory solution. The authorities of the two countries cannot be ignorant of this!</p>
<h3>Europe on the Brink of War and Peace; Germany, the Soviet Union, and Italy to Hold Trilateral Consultations; Berlin Holds All-Night Meeting to Discuss War Plans; Germany Expresses Frustration and Unease After Peace Offer Rejected</h3>
<p>Berlin. According to news from the Nazi Party last night, due to the failure of Hitler's peace plan, Germany will immediately hold a trilateral conference with the Soviet Union and Italy to discuss "matters of common defense." Germany's only goal now is to win victory in the final battle with Britain and France, so as to restore European peace. Hitler met all night yesterday with his [unclear] members and personnel from the army, navy, and air force to discuss continued war plans. Authoritative sources claimed last night that Soviet People's Commissar Molotov and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will arrive in Berlin to begin trilateral consultations to decide on a plan to stop the war by military means. German officials said that British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons was an insult to Germany. An authoritative German government spokesman still said that peace was hopeless, only saying that in Hitler's parliamentary speech, he asked all peace-loving people for a reply. As of today, there has been no reply, and the German government can no longer wait any longer. (14th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Hague. After the Prime Ministers of Britain and France delivered their speeches one after another, many Dutch newspapers said that Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union would hold talks. The "Evening News" carried a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent, saying, "German political figures all say that according to the treaties signed between Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union, the three countries of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union should hold political and military talks in Berlin in the short term, even within 48 hours. The Soviet representative may be People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov, and the Italian representative may be Foreign Minister Ciano. German newspapers continue to attack Britain, saying that it should be held responsible for prolonging the war." The "Evening News" also said, "Last night, Berlin was filled with an atmosphere of indignation and unease, but it was also believed that the situation had not yet reached the end of the road, and it was still hoped that neutral countries could come forward to mediate at the last minute to avoid disaster.</p>
<p>In addition, after the Soviet Union expanded its power along the Baltic coast, German officials are extremely worried, believing that German interests have been harmed. The Baltic coast was originally within Germany's sphere of influence. Now, even if it is not completely lost, it has to allow a strong neighbor to share a portion. Although the German Foreign Ministry says that it is not interested in the incidents that have occurred along the Baltic coast, this is indeed helpless, just a consolation. In fact, people in the country's army and navy are very angry." (14th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin. Regarding rumors that Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union are about to hold talks, the Foreign Ministry here said that they knew nothing about it. (14th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Stockholm. Swedish newspapers' dispatches from Berlin all reported in detail on the situation of the Nazi military administrative meeting after British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech, saying that those who participated in the discussion, Hitler, Air Force Minister Göring, and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, all acknowledged that after careful study of the British Prime Minister's speech, they did not find any suggestions for negotiating with Germany based on Hitler's conditions, and finally decided to adopt a plan to continue fighting. Immediately, residents of dozens of towns in the Rhineland were ordered to evacuate. Hitler may go to the Western Front in person on Saturday or Sunday to supervise the war, but the German army's general offensive may not be launched immediately. The German authorities claim that they are now focusing their naval power to destroy British shipping. They have controlled the North Sea, and German warships are now luring British warships to a place where German bombers can attack them. At the same time, the German government is still relying on the Soviet Union. Germany has not yet said a word about the Finnish issue, which is proof of this. Germany and the Soviet Union are currently starting discussions in Moscow, planning to have Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov or Defense Minister Voroshilov travel to Berlin, or have German officials travel to Moscow, so as to continue the German-Soviet cooperation initiated by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. In some circumstances, the Soviet Union will maintain neutrality from beginning to end, avoiding war with Britain and France, and actively engaging in commerce, indirectly benefiting Germany. The German officials in charge seem to be satisfied with this approach by the Soviet Union. The German Foreign Ministry is also closely watching the Soviet-Turkish negotiations. According to news from Berlin, judging from the telegrams from the capitals of the Soviet Union and Turkey, the Soviet-Turkish treaty is about to be completed. Although Turkey's relationship with Western European countries will not be interrupted by this, Soviet interests can still cover up Turkey's relationship with Britain and France. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Brussels. According to news from Berlin, German observers said that when Führer Hitler made various peace proposals a few days ago, he said that what was said here was the final word. If it was rejected, there would be no more suggestions. Although British Prime Minister Chamberlain has firmly rejected this proposal, the Führer's speech was not only aimed at the enemy countries. Because [unclear] must wait for the reaction of the neutral countries to Chamberlain's expression. In other words, the proposals made by Germany are directed at the countries of the world, and this point still remains, and it is still necessary to wait for the neutral countries to take action. Führer Hitler's desire for peace will not be completely dispelled by Britain's negative answer. However, if the neutral countries turn a deaf ear, then they will not be able to escape responsibility after the outbreak of war in the future. It is a real situation that Germany cannot wait forever, but people in the country's political circles refuse to explain how long it can wait, only saying that while everything is still uncertain, the German government does not intend to immediately consult the Soviet Union.

<h3>The Soviet Plan is Still Moderate; Optimism for Soviet-Finnish Negotiations; Three Nordic Countries Express Deep Concern to the Soviet Union; President Roosevelt's Appeal Remains Unanswered</h3>
<p>Helsinki: The Finnish government published an official gazette stating, "The Finnish government believes there is still a possibility for negotiations with Moscow, hoping the Soviet-Finnish issue can be resolved in a reasonable manner." Finnish President Kallio, in view of the national emergency, invoked national defense laws, ordering every citizen to undertake national defense and security work. The President also issued emergency police regulations in preparation for the possibility of war. The Cabinet is studying the Soviet plan. Although the situation is tense, the nature of the Soviet plan still allows for continued negotiations. (October 13, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Swiss Capital: Negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union have begun in Moscow. According to news from Helsinki, the country's attitude remains firm, but the general public is more optimistic about the future of the talks and is very grateful for the mediation efforts of the United States and the governments of the Scandinavian Peninsula. (October 13, Havas)</p>
<p>Swedish Capital: According to a German news agency, Helsinki is gradually becoming optimistic about the outcome of the ongoing Soviet-Finnish talks in Moscow. Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko told guests that the Finnish people were greatly heartened by the news of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark's representations to the Soviet Union. When news reporters inquired about the Soviet Union's demands on Finland, the Finnish Intelligence Bureau only stated that the Finnish delegation in Moscow had received a memorandum from Stalin, but it was not an ultimatum. Last night, the Finnish Foreign Ministry studied a telegram from the Finnish Chief Representative Paasikivi until this morning. It is said that Germany refused to rebroadcast Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko's speech on Thursday night to the Americas due to Soviet pressure. A local newspaper reprinted a Moscow dispatch from the German "Frankfurter Zeitung," stating that the first demands made by the Soviet Union to Finland were relatively moderate, but included a clause requiring administrative cooperation on the Åland Islands. (October 14, Reuters)</p>
<p>Moscow: Responsible parties here recently confirmed that the ambassadors of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, the three countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula, to the Soviet Union, separately delivered notes to the Soviet government yesterday, expressing deep concern about the talks between the Soviet Union and Finland. It is still unknown what the three countries will do. In addition, after the Finnish representatives held talks with the Soviet authorities yesterday, they telegraphed the government for instructions. As they have not yet received instructions, it will be difficult to continue the talks tonight. Foreign observers commented that the talks between the Soviet Union and Finland would take longer than the talks between the Soviet Union and the Baltic countries, because Finnish representative Paasikivi does not have full authority and must consult with the government at any time. (October 13, Havas)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Foreign observers believe that Sweden has expressed its willingness to fully support Finland's negotiations in Moscow. Some even say that Finland and Sweden will conclude a military alliance. (October 14, Hai Tong Telegraph)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt stated today that the United States' representations to the Soviet Union regarding Finnish affairs only express the United States' attention and hope that it will not take actions that disrupt the peaceful relations in the Baltic Sea or Finnish independence. This representation should not be seen as pressure from the United States. (October 13, Reuters)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt announced yesterday that the document he sent to the Soviet Union was a private appeal to Soviet Chairman Kalinin. He has not yet received a response from the Soviet side, but the Soviet side has acknowledged receiving the document. The document, requesting the Soviet government not to interfere in Finnish independence, was submitted by the U.S. Ambassador to Moscow, Steinhardt, to the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov. He said that the United States does not want to take any action that could be seen as interfering in Soviet actions in the Baltic Sea, so he will not publish the original text of the document. (October 13, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Washington: Finnish Ambassador to the United States, Procope, visited Secretary of State Hull yesterday. The content of the conversation was not announced. (October 14, Associated Press)</p>
<h3>Lloyd George: Plea for Peace; Believes the British Prime Minister's Remarks Add Nothing to the Facts</h3>
<p>London: Lloyd George, chairman of the British "Peace Reconstruction Society," launched a nationwide "Tugun" movement today and convened the first general meeting to resolve various issues. The "Peace Reconstruction Society" passed a resolution, stating that Chamberlain's speech clearly adds nothing to the facts, so it is best to convene an international peace conference to prevent excessive emotional stimulation. (October 14, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Note: This "Peace Reconstruction Society" was founded by Lloyd George a few years ago and is not affiliated with any major political party. During elections, this society often opposes the government party and supports Labor candidates.</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Did Not Deliver a Speech Last Night</h3>
<p>London: Officials have recently announced that reports that Prime Minister Chamberlain was scheduled to deliver a broadcast speech tonight are untrue. (October 14, Havas)</p>
<h3>Germany Does Not Intend to Ask the US to Mediate Peace; Roosevelt Refuses to Criticize Hitler's Proposal</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German official news agency recently denied the claim that Germany has appealed to U.S. President Roosevelt to mediate the war. It is said that Germany has neither made such an appeal nor intends to do so. (October 14, Reuters)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt declared that he had not received formal notification from the German government regarding its peace proposals, so he could not offer any criticism on the matter. (October 13, Reuters)</p>
<p>Swiss Capital: It has recently been learned that the head of the German Propaganda Office, Dietrich, made a statement to a reporter from a Dutch newspaper, stating that the European war can only be avoided if neutral countries, including the United States, come forward to mediate. (October 13, Havas)</p>
<p>Berlin: The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating that the head of the Propaganda Office, Dietrich, said to foreign reporters today that the Western European war could only be avoided if U.S. President Roosevelt came forward to mediate. Foreign parties have misinterpreted this statement, claiming that Director Dietrich intended to appeal to President Roosevelt to mediate. This is obviously a fabrication. In fact, although this was a private conversation, it is not permissible to misinterpret it at will. (October 13, Havas)</p>
<p>London: Sources with close ties to the Vatican report that the Holy See is not prepared to use Hitler's speech as a basis for advocating peace negotiations. (October 14, Reuters)</p>
<h3>The Transfer of Polish Territory to Other Countries is Not Endorsed by the UK</h3>
<p>London: It is reported that the British government has explained to the Lithuanian government that, as the United Kingdom is an ally of Poland, the British government cannot endorse the transfer of Polish territory to other countries. Therefore, the British government cannot recognize the transfer of the Vilnius province to Lithuania under the Soviet-Lithuanian treaty. However, the general public here acknowledges that Lithuania's acquisition of Vilnius cannot be compared to the German-Soviet partition of Poland, nor can it be strongly condemned as Germany and the Soviet Union were, due to the following two reasons: (1) The Soviet-Lithuanian treaty was signed by Lithuania under Soviet duress. If the Soviet Union compensates Lithuania for the loss of its independence with some land, it is hardly blameworthy for Lithuania to accept this land. (2) The Polish residents of Vilnius under Lithuanian administration may be better off than under Soviet or German rule. (October 14, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Turkish Negotiations Continue; Agreement Imminent; Neutralization of the Tatar Strait Does Not Conflict with the Interests of Britain and France</h3>
<p>Moscow: Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu held another meeting with Soviet leaders last night. It is expected that the Soviet Union and Turkey will conclude a treaty soon. Well-informed sources here believe that the treaty will take the form of a mutual assistance treaty, with Turkey undertaking to neutralize the Tatar Strait. The treaty will not conflict with the interests of Britain and France. (October 10, Reuters)</p>
<p>Moscow: Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu went to the Kremlin at 5:00 PM for talks with Soviet government officials, which lasted for two hours. Foreign Minister Saracoğlu has been here for nearly three weeks, but this is only the second time he has met with Soviet authorities. According to foreign observers, the Soviet authorities no longer insist that Turkey must remain neutral if war breaks out in the Mediterranean. Therefore, the talks between the two sides will now be accelerated, and an agreement will be reached in a short period of time that takes into account the interests of both the Soviet Union and Turkey, while not hindering the interests held by Britain and France. In addition, Foreign Minister Saracoğlu has maintained close contact with the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, and the French Chargé d'affaires, Payart. (October 13, Havas)</p>

<p>Moscow: Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Molotov, recently received a telegram from Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys, which read: "Our delegation visited your capital to engage in negotiations, and as a result, a treaty was successfully signed on October 10th. We are deeply grateful for your warm hospitality. We are also deeply moved that Mr. Stalin, based on his understanding of the wishes of the Lithuanian people, resolutely participated in the talks, further enhancing the traditional friendship and mutual trust between the two countries. Our historic city of Vilnius and the Vilnius province have also been perfectly restored. All our people are rejoicing and sincerely grateful."</p>

According to the treaty signed between Germany and Lithuania after Germany handed Memel to Lithuania in 1919, Memel was reincorporated into Germany. (October 11, Reuters)</p>
<h3>UK Policy of Stabilizing Chinese Legal Tender Unchanged</h3>
<p>London: According to Reuters sources, the news broadcast by German radio stations that Britain has canceled its support for Chinese legal tender is inaccurate. The British government has repeatedly announced in Parliament recently that it has no intention of changing its policy towards Chinese legal tender, as maintaining the exchange rate value of Chinese legal tender is in the interests of all countries trading with China. The fund established by the British government-guaranteed loan to stabilize Chinese legal tender still exists. (October 14, Reuters)</p>

<p>London: It is reported that to date, a total of 23 neutral merchant ships have been sunk by German mines or submarines. In addition, nine Swedish ships are being held in Gothenburg due to the risk of hitting German mines. According to observers here, Germany will soon begin to ask whether sinking neutral ships is an appropriate method, as most of the neutral ships sunk belong to the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula, and Germany can only conduct maritime trade with these countries. It is reported that since the implementation of the convoy system, as of October 10, 1,275 British ships and 47 Allied ships have safely reached their destinations under escort. No ships under escort have been sunk by German submarines.

The British and French Allied forces on the Western Front are ready and will give them a head-on blow. Due to adverse weather conditions, the British Allied forces will not launch a large-scale offensive this year and will wait until the spring of 1940 to launch a major offensive. This move will greatly benefit the Allied forces, as Hitler must achieve a quick victory and cannot wait until next spring. The British Air Force has secretly completed its reorganization. Six weeks ago, the British government sent several experts to Poland to inspect the German Air Force's war record. This reorganization is based on their report. (October 14, Associated Press)</p>

Some of the information he obtained was provided by the Governor of the Virgin Islands, Cramer, and confirmed by the U.S. naval and air patrols. Snyder declined to specify the nationality of the submarines, but hinted that they belonged to Germany. Snyder also said that there appeared to be facilities for refueling submarines at sea.

<h3>Britain Does Not Intend to Organize Foreign Legion; Foreign Nationals May Voluntarily Enlist, Receiving the Same Treatment as the British</h3>
<p>London - British Secretary of State for War, Leslie Hore-Belisha, stated to reporters today that people of Allied nations within British territory may join the British Army. Any foreigners residing in Britain may voluntarily enlist, but will be managed by the Home Office. When conscription occurs, they will be drafted into the army according to their age, receiving the same treatment as the British. The British government does not restrict nationality, but does not wish to organize foreign legions like the Polish or Czech armies that France has. In this war, we have abolished all distinctions within the army and made it a single army, he said. The Secretary of State also stated that French military experts pointed out that the British Expeditionary Force's transport to France, without any unexpected incidents, was the greatest marching achievement and the first victory of the Allies in this war. In fact, this achievement was not only unknown to the Germans, but also unheard of by the French at first. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Germans Withdraw from the Baltic Sea; British Newspaper Comments on German Policy as Encountering a Second Failure</h3>
<p>London - Today's "The Times" stated that the German withdrawal from the Baltic Sea is the second major failure of the Nazi Party's policy since the outbreak of war. The first blow to the Nazi Party's policy was the miscalculation of its plan to annex Poland, which led to the alienation of the countries in southeastern Europe, all of whom are now looking to Moscow for guidance. The newspaper continued that this second failure seems to have a greater impact on the Nazi Party's prestige in Europe, as the Baltic coastal countries have had close ties with Prussia for centuries. The newspaper concluded that it goes without saying which force will replace Germany's position after its withdrawal. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Economic Assistance to Germany; Limited Scope of Economic Agreement</h3>
<p>"New York Shipping News" - Since the establishment of the agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, exporters here who have been trading with the Soviet Union for 20 years have been very skeptical of the rumors that the Soviet Union can provide large-scale economic assistance to Germany. It is generally believed that the economic agreement was signed before the treaty of non-aggression was concluded, and its provisions are quite limited. It would be fortunate if the Soviet Union could fulfill it. Because the Soviet Union needs to import large quantities of goods from foreign countries to meet domestic needs. For example, the rumors that the Soviet Union is preparing to supply Germany with kerosene to help it fight the war are exaggerated. Kerosene is one of the Soviet Union's major imports. How can it be expected to supply it to Germany? According to the economic agreement signed by the two countries in August, the Soviet Union should exchange various raw materials for various German manufactured goods, with a minimum amount of US$36 million in the next two years. But one thing that people outside the Soviet Union have not paid attention to is that its significance is extremely important, that is, the Soviet government recently issued an order authorizing the People's Committee for Foreign Trade to cancel or suspend the implementation of this commercial agreement if it encounters difficulties in the implementation of commercial terms. The promulgation of this order was a matter of ten days ago, and the intention is obviously to create an ideal excuse so that it can stop trading with Germany when necessary. An exporter here said, "Recently, it has been rumored that the Soviet Union can supply Germany with a large amount of kerosene, which is exaggerated. Considering that the Soviet Union must import kerosene from the United States every year, it is known that its demand is far above its domestic production. According to statistics, the country imported 546,407 barrels of refined oil from the United States in 1936, which increased to 1,544,244 barrels in 1937, and the number was even more than this in 1938. Under this circumstance, how can Germany expect the Soviet Union to supply the country with kerosene for its long-term war?" As for Germany, according to another exporter, "Apart from exporting mediocre machines, there is really nothing that can be supplied to the Soviet Union. And as far as this machine is concerned, it is doubtful that Germany can manufacture it in large quantities during the period of foreign warfare. Moreover, the Soviet Union does not rely solely on Germany, and the United States also has machines shipped to the Soviet Union. Regarding this point, although German heavy industry has an advantage, that is, the country is closer to the Soviet Union, so it has some convenience in competition, but American machine exporters can supply the Soviet Union with products under more favorable conditions than Germany, which is at war, and it is easy to get started. For this reason, we firmly believe that the Soviet government will order a large number of machines from the United States this year, and the number ordered from Germany will definitely be very small. If the current economic agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union is still intact by March next year, then the Soviet Union should order industrial machinery worth about US$20 million from Germany. If Germany cannot deliver all the goods within a reasonable time limit, then the minimum amount stipulated in this agreement, that is, US$36 million, will inevitably not be reached." In addition, foreign merchants also believe that the main goods that the Soviet Union can supply to Germany are nothing more than timber and limited food. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Encountering a Difficult Situation; Changes in Key Personnel of the Foreign and Army Ministries</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Nichinichi Shimbun - Now that the cabinet has accepted the demand of the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the unification of political and economic diplomacy, and has made concessions on the issue of the Ministry of Trade, it is now facing the difficult problems of (1) determining responsibility for this dispute, (2) restoring the dignity of the cabinet, and (3) correcting the discipline of officials. The issue of responsibility can easily be resolved by accepting the resignation of Vice Minister Masayuki Tani to relieve the blame for the disobedience of political affairs officials. It is heard that Ambassador to China, Ariyoshi Kato, is expected to succeed as Vice Minister. When Prime Minister Abe explained the resolution of this dispute to reporters, he stated that there was no issue of Foreign Minister Nomura's resignation. The Foreign Minister still retains the power to appoint and dismiss commercial officials, and is responsible for negotiating commercial agreements, protecting commercial rights, and handling overseas Japanese businesses related to Japan's foreign relations. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - After Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Masayuki Tani, and Director of the Bureau of Commerce, Matsushima, submitted their resignations to take responsibility, the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have now decided to appoint Ariyoshi Kato, the Ambassador to China, as the successor to the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and will formally issue the order at the regular cabinet meeting on the 16th.

<p>San Francisco - Famous American economist, Roger Babson, arrived here today after traveling in the Far East. He said that Eastern affairs are more closely related to the United States, and the United States should pay closer attention to them. The United States overemphasizes the European war, but does not know that the changes currently taking place in the East are more important to the United States than the European war. If the United States can develop the trade potential of the Far East, the unemployment problem in the United States can be completely solved. According to Mr. Babson, when he was in the Far East, he conducted considerable research on the background of the Sino-Japanese War. (Associated Press, 14th)</p>
<h3>Manchurian Soybeans Shipped to Germany; German Merchants Trying to Find a Way to Transship Through the Soviet Union</h3>

<h3>U.S. Senate Continues Debate on Neutrality Bill; Taft Supports Pittman's Proposal</h3>
<p>Washington - The Senate met today to continue the debate on the Neutrality Act amendment. Republican Senator Taft (a potential Republican presidential candidate) delivered a speech criticizing the arms embargo, saying that it only benefits aggressor nations and is not conducive to peace-loving nations. "As far as I can see," he said, "the United States can avoid being drawn into the vortex of war even if it does not maintain the arms embargo. The Neutrality Act amendment proposed by Pittman, which prohibits American ships from carrying goods to belligerent countries, is particularly appropriate. However, I do not agree with one of its clauses, which advocates giving belligerent countries a 90-day credit loan when purchasing military equipment from the United States, and it should be repealed." Republican Senator Nye (leader of the isolationists) followed with a speech, strongly arguing that if the arms embargo were lifted, American industry might flourish during the war, but it would be dangerous for the future national economic structure. The United States would also be unable to help restore peace. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Washington - Republican Senator Taft of Ohio yesterday strongly supported President Roosevelt's Neutrality Act amendment at a Senate meeting, calling for the repeal of the arms embargo clause in the current Neutrality Act. He called this clause "a discrimination against Britain, France, and other peace-loving countries, and we are morally obligated to correct it." Taft then proposed an amendment suggesting that the government declare the so-called war zone and prohibit American ships from sailing within 300 miles of the European coast. Taft also suggested cash transactions and restricting belligerent countries from purchasing with the U.S. Equalization Fund. Taft's proposed restrictions on ship navigation were immediately approved by a majority. Vice President Garner has been the most active in this regard. He believes that this will allow the debate to end and the vote to take place as soon as possible. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has agreed to study Garner's proposal and will issue an opinion next week. Isolationist Nye said, "A solid fortification cannot be built on this arena of large-scale slaughter." He said that if the United States abolishes the arms embargo clause in the current Neutrality Act, not only will the national economy be greatly affected, but the United States will also lose its position in the world peace movement. (Associated Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington - Famous aviator Charles Lindbergh delivered a radio speech today opposing the repeal of the arms embargo clause. He said, "If we repeal the arms embargo clause and help one side of the belligerent countries to defeat the other, then why talk about neutrality? Those who advocate the repeal of the arms embargo clause must know that this action is the first step to drawing the United States into the vortex of war. After this step is taken, the second step will be to expand loans, and then to send troops to help fight. Furthermore, the repeal of the arms embargo will not benefit democracy, because I firmly believe that the current war in Europe is not fought for democracy, but for the balance of power in Europe... If the German side tries to expand its military power, and the British and French fear this military power, and we then supply them with military equipment, the war will become longer and Europe will become more dilapidated. If Britain and France could have made concessions to Germany after the last European war, then the current war would not have occurred." (Associated Press, 14th)</p>

<h3>Chongqing Residents Pay Attention to Konoe's Statement</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Great attention is being paid here to Konoe's recent statement on his talks with Wang Jingwei, and the situation discussed by Hiranuma with Wang when he was prime minister, and the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China and the Japanese Command in Central China have also successively issued proclamations. Various circles in China here said that from these proclamations, it can be seen that Tokyo and the Japanese military authorities in China have different opinions on Japan's future policy in China. Many believe that the publication of Konoe's draft document is half intended to explore whether Japan is willing to negotiate peace conditions directly with Chongqing if it stops military operations. China is willing to negotiate. Many believe that the reason why Wang Jingwei has not immediately started to form a new government is also because of this. In the opinion of various circles in China, Konoe's proposal has been severely opposed by the Japanese military authorities in China. It is recalled that the headquarters of the Japanese Expeditionary Force once issued a proclamation stating that the Japanese army intends to strictly implement military operations in China, and a spokesman for the Japanese army in Central China also announced that the Japanese army will support Wang Jingwei's efforts to form a new government. The Central Daily News issued a critique of the current situation, saying that Japan has fallen into despair in China and does not know what to do. This fact has made its policies inconsistent, the cabinet has repeatedly changed, and has caused disputes in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Chinese observers believe that the Japanese know that they cannot conquer China by force, and cannot obtain a solution to the war. It is expected that there will be more changes in the cabinet in Tokyo, and opinions within the country will be even more conflicting. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>Ji Shiwen Fights Bravely Against the Enemy; National Government Awards Medal</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The National Government issued an order on the 13th that Ji Shiwen be awarded the Ninth-Class Baoding Medal. Here is a record of Ji's deeds: Ji is a private in a certain unit of our army in Ji Province. On September 1st, in the battle of Wangzhuang in Neihuang, he was surrounded by the enemy. At that time, the soldier stood alone and fought bravely. Because he was too close to the enemy, his rifle failed, so he threw several hand grenades, killing two enemies. Then, he engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The soldier was already wounded in several places, but he still fought hard, one against ten. Then, with a loud roar, he jumped towards the enemy line and charged straight ahead, wielding his knife and killing three enemy soldiers in a row. Finally, because he used too much force, his knife stuck in the enemy's bone and he could not pull it back. He was taken away by an enemy soldier with a knife. The remaining enemies were frightened and retreated. The soldier took the opportunity to jump out of the enemy's position and safely returned to the camp. After the commander-in-chief reported the matter, he said that the soldier was brave in killing the enemy and fearless, and was worthy of praise, so he telegraphed to the authorities, requesting that he be commended.

<h3>The Japanese Army Invades Shiqi: More Than a Thousand Traitors Secretly Act as Insiders</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: On the 1st of this month, the Chinese army once stormed into Shenzhen, resulting in fierce fighting. At the same time, the Japanese army once again invaded Zhongshan, and after ten days of fierce fighting, Shiqi, where the Zhongshan County government is located, was occupied by the Japanese army at 3:00 PM on the 7th of this month. The following is a record of the battle:</p>
<p>Zhongshan is a county near Guangzhou, bordering the Pearl River Estuary to the east and Portuguese-occupied Macau to the south. The rivers are crisscrossed like a spider web, and the products are abundant. Since the fall of Guangzhou, it has become a major transportation route between the inland areas of Guangdong Province and overseas. However, since Daliang and Jiangmen followed Guangzhou in falling into enemy hands, Zhongshan has been surrounded by the Japanese army in fact. At the beginning of last month, when the battle situation in Central China was unfolding, the Japanese side began to launch indiscriminate attacks on various places along the river in Zhongshan in order to contain the Chinese forces. By the end of last month, the Japanese army in Central China had made steady progress, thinking that Changsha could be taken at any moment. In fact, there was no need to contain the Chinese forces, so the battle situation in Zhongshan gradually subsided. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army suffered a major defeat in an ambush in northern Hunan. The Japanese side urgently dispatched two to three thousand reinforcements from the 5th and 6th of this month to invade Shiqi on a large scale in several routes with the combined forces of the army, navy, and air force. The Chinese defense teams immediately rose up and fought back separately. After two days of fierce fighting, both sides suffered heavy losses. Until the afternoon of the 7th, more than a thousand traitors suddenly sneaked into Shiqi City, set fires, and rioted. The Chinese army, suffering this blow, withdrew from Shiqi. Cuiheng Village, the hometown of Sun Yat-sen, was also reduced to ruins under the indiscriminate bombing of Japanese aircraft. It is heard that the only purpose of the Japanese army's attack on Zhongshan was to cover up their failure in Central China. In reality, they had no spare strength to penetrate into the inland areas of Guangdong Province, and they did not dare to risk attacking Xijiang to bring about their own destruction. However, with the fall of Zhongshan, Macau and Hong Kong are often significantly affected. The production of grain, fish, meat, and vegetables in Zhongshan County is exceptionally abundant. After Guangzhou, Hainan, and Chaoshan successively fell into enemy hands, Zhongshan has become the only source of grain and vegetables for Hong Kong and Macau. Now that this source is cut off, the food panic in Hong Kong and Macau will inevitably be even worse. (Note: The Japanese army that invaded Shiqi was repelled by the Chinese army on the 11th, and Shiqi was about to be recovered, which shows the fragility of the Japanese army. Although they gained Shiqi, they could not hold it.)</p>
<h3>The Tongruhai Guerrilla隊, Sun's Department Expands its Force</h3>
<p>Zhang's Regiment has been reorganized into a Brigade</p>
<p>Nantong Correspondence: The guerrilla units in Tongzhou, Rugao, Hai'an, and Qidong counties in northern Jiangsu, last year ××× and others, once united various miscellaneous units, hoping to make changes. After the provincial government ordered the transfer of Sun's brigade commander of the ×th Brigade and Zhang's regiment commander to lead their troops to suppress and reorganize them on the spot, the brigade has expanded to eight or nine thousand people. The equipment is sophisticated, and the grain and ammunition are sufficient. They have repeatedly engaged in encounters with the Japanese army, killing many Japanese soldiers. After the provincial government reported to the commander of the ×th Military Region, he issued an order to commend them, and designated Tongzhou, Rugao, and Hai'an counties as defense areas, planning to recover the lost territory in northern Jiangsu. In addition to Zhang's regiment being reorganized into a brigade, it is also heard that Sun's brigade commander will be promoted to division commander.</p>
<h3>The Wuxi Puppet Government Attempts to Collect Land Tax</h3>
<p>And intimidates villagers to protect the highway</p>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: In the countryside of Xiyi, the early rice has already been harvested, and only the late rice needs a few more weeks to be cut. The puppet county government has already found a way to levy the "land tax." Because there are many guerrilla隊 in the rural areas, the villagers also refuse to come to the city to pay. The puppet government previously set up mobile "collection points" in Kaiyuan and Yangming townships, but they were also afraid of guerrilla隊 attacks and hid at any time. Recently, they sent puppet tax collectors carrying "a string of tickets" to Nanqiao, Nanfangquan, and other places to urge collection, and dozens of puppet police and Japanese soldiers went with them. They gathered under the Tongyun Bridge on the 12th, but the countryside had already heard the news and ignored them all. It is expected that there will be no results.</p>
<p>In the Xijing section of the Xihu Highway, from the Chajia Bridge section, there are eleven bridges of various sizes, all of which are believed to have been destroyed by the Chinese army. The Japanese puppets have been greatly affected. On the 7th of this month, the Japanese side ordered the puppet government to order the farmers along the highway to be responsible for protecting it. The Japanese army will repair the bridges. If the bridges are damaged again, the farmers in the section should raise funds to repair them. If they disobey, the river will be filled and the drinking water of the villages will be cut off. The villagers were not alarmed by this dangerous threat, because the Chinese army appears and disappears unpredictably, and it is impossible to bear this responsibility. The Japanese puppets also have no practical solution.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Various Parts of Pinghu</h3>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Handles the Situation of Unified Enrollment in the Current Session: More Than 19,000 People Apply for the Exam, and More Than 5,000 New Students are Admitted</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) The new students admitted by the unified enrollment of national universities and colleges this year have been distributed to the schools by the Ministry of Education and announced on August 23. According to news from the Unified Enrollment Committee, the unified enrollment this year was held simultaneously in 15 districts and 13 sub-offices across the country. A total of 21,338 students applied for the exam. Except for the Chenxi District Lantian Sub-office, because of postal delays, the scores of 1,000 examinees have not yet been sent. The scores of examinees from the remaining districts and offices have been sent to the Ministry, totaling 19,039 people. After the Ministry reviewed the scores, 5,085 new university students were admitted, accounting for 26% of the examinees, which is four to one. Graduates of secondary schools accounted for about 91% of the admitted students, and those with equivalent academic ability accounted for 8%. In addition to restricting one-tenth of the number of people with equivalent academic ability, they must also have scores that are in the first half of the number of people who can be admitted before they can be admitted. The group of admitted students, the first group of departments in the colleges of liberal arts, law, business, and the Chinese, English, civics, training, education, and physical education departments of the normal colleges admitted 1,783 people. The second group of departments in the colleges of science and engineering and the mathematics, physics, and chemistry departments of the normal colleges admitted 2,679 people. The third group of departments in the colleges of agriculture and medicine and the natural history department of the normal college admitted 623 people. The admitted students have now been assigned to 22 national colleges and universities, as well as Chongqing University of Sichuan Province and Henan Provincial University, a total of 24 units. The distribution standard is that the first step is to completely follow the examinee's first choice, according to the score, and give priority to the distribution. If the first choice is full and cannot be distributed, the second and third choices will be followed, and the examination area will be referred to for distribution. Examinees in this area have the priority to be distributed to schools in this area, followed by nearby areas, and then other areas. If all three choices of the examinee are full, they will be assigned to colleges and departments with similar characteristics in this area or nearby areas. In addition to the admitted new university students, those whose scores are not too far from the admission standard are admitted as university preparatory students, a total of 1,025 people, and distributed to various university preparatory classes for study. The general public often has two opposite views on the width and strictness of the unified enrollment admission standards. On the university side, every hope is that the standard will be raised and fewer places will be taken, while the society is afraid that the majority of students who are interested in further education will be unable to study and hope to admit them leniently. The Ministry of Education considers the scores of examinees, the needs of the country, and the capacity of the schools, and determines the admission standards. Judging from the ratio of the number of examinees to the number of admitted students being four to one, the standard cannot be said to be too low. In the past, each school conducted its own examinations, and students could apply for several schools at the same time. Therefore, the results of the admissions of each school were as high as ten to one. Now, because of the unified examination, students can only apply once, and the admission ratio cannot be so far away. As for the number of students who are not admitted, although there are often many, among them, nearly 5,000 people who apply for the examination with equivalent academic ability can still return to middle school to study. Those who have graduated from middle school can apply for military schools and schools related to military industrial technology to meet the urgent needs of the war of resistance. A part can apply for vocational schools and various specialized courses designated by the Ministry of Education. These specialized courses continue to enroll students, and young people can enter this type of school to learn corresponding skills to meet the needs of national construction. Those who must enter the university for further study, the number of people approved by the Ministry to be recruited by provincial and private colleges and universities this year is about 5,000, and each student also has the opportunity to try again. The remaining few students who cannot go to school can also find ways to find employment as intermediate-level cadres in the society, which is also the practical need of the country today.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's and Today's Western League Matches: Football Postponed</h3>
<p>Yiyuan is Unusable After the Rain</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, it rained heavily for four hours, and the water accumulated deeply in various places. The Yiyuan racecourse in the Racecourse Hall was turned into a sea. The Western League Football A-League matches, originally scheduled to open yesterday, Lido vs. North West Children, and today morning's Donghua vs. French Business, were all postponed according to the Western League Association's notice yesterday morning. The Autumn Sports Meet of Public Utilities yesterday, and the handicap basketball and United States small ball competitions yesterday and today were also postponed together.</p>
<h3>The Four-Corner Cross-Country Race: Held This Morning</h3>
<p>Starting at Minzhi at 6:30 AM</p>
<p>The cross-country competition between Hongkou, Qingguang, Lian Da, and Youqiang, with a distance of four and a half miles, is scheduled to start at 6:30 AM this morning in front of the Minzhi Middle School on Qi Haiwei Road, rain or shine. Each team has ten participants. The scores are calculated based on the six who arrive first. Among the teams, Hongkou is the most雄厚 in strength. It will definitely be a blockbuster at that time, giving the teams a very heavy threat. Although Youqiang has heroes such as Gao Dingtai, its strength seems to be lacking in balance, but the fierce competition will definitely add a lot of color to this year's cross-country race. However, the heavy rain last night turned Fuxu Road and Da Xi Road into rivers, and it is still doubtful whether it can be held this morning. The route starts from Weihaiwei Road, passes Fuxu Road and Da Xi Road, turns left into Yidingpan Road, and goes east along Haige Road to turn into Fuxu Road and Weihaiwei Road to the finish line.</p>

<h3>Finance: US-British Exchange Rate Rises Again by Four Yuan. Speculation Leads to Selling British Gold and Buying US Exchange Rate. US Exchange Rate Closes at Seven Yuan and Five Jiao. HSBC Maintains British Gold But Then Returns Heavily. Continuous Low Discount Rates Lead to Tightening.</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market situation yesterday, HSBC's listing price, remained unchanged. The British-US exchange rate on the black market, due to the situation in Europe, after Britain and France rejected Mr. Xi's peace proposal, the world deeply believes that peace is hopeless, causing overseas pounds (belligerent countries) to plummet again. The morning price of three yuan, nine jiao, six fen, three li was as low as three yuan, nine jiao, four fen, five li, two, a huge drop of seven and a half fen. And speculative merchants in this city, and certain foreign banks with profit and foreign electrics, etc., all sold British gold, the momentum was turbulent. Fortunately, HSBC made every effort to maintain it, and the magnitude of the stomach could be described as rare. It is heard that it had absorbed more than 200,000 pounds from a certain two foreign banks. One call and a hundred responses caused other merchants to join in the buying, and the buying intention of Sassoon and the Tianjin gang also arose spontaneously, so the price was very tight. The closing US exchange rate was seven yuan and five jiao, and the British gold was also tightened to four pints, five, six, two, five. As for the future trend, it is the same as the spot, only heard of buying US exchange rate, but no British gold. The far-term (November) British-US exchange rate was three yuan, one jiao, two fen, seven li, two. The half-day transaction was smooth. Since the continuous low discount rates, the current筹码 is full. Those who could not speculate in the foreign exchange market due to the shortage of cash in the past can now resume their activities. Therefore, the public debt market transaction is clear (public debt transactions are all done with exchange), and the foreign exchange buying trend has risen again. The recent exchange rate tightening and the low discount rate are not without reason.</p>
<p>British Gold Buying Trend Turns Strong at Noon</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London big bar, near-term length is half a pint, and the far-term has no honor or disgrace. New York silver price soared by one point and one two five. London raw gold is stable, the exchange rate British vs. US, vs. Shanghai, vs. France are all flat, the US vs. British shrank by seven and a half points, vs. Shanghai fell by five points, and vs. France fell by a small three points eight seven five. The central listing price for each exchange rate is as before. The bank opened spot selling prices in the morning, British gold four pints six five six two five, US exchange rate seven yuan six eight seven five. Compared with the previous closing, the British gold loose zero three one two five, the US exchange rate is soft zero six two five, which is due to the contraction of the exchange rate. After the opening, although the US bank tried to sell British gold, and foreign electrics and speculative merchants also sold British gold, because HSBC's stomach was very strong, the market was slightly tight. It is estimated that HSBC ate into a certain foreign bank, foreign electrics, and speculative merchants' spot British gold four pints six five six two five and six two five (heard to be a large number). HSBC announced that the listing price would not move, and the silver balance tax announcement continued to be large two points seven five. After that, the speculative merchants, in view of the fact that HSBC's stomach was so strong, also stopped selling and turned to buying, coupled with the fact that Western merchants Sassoon and foreign firms and the Tianjin gang all rushed to settle, so the situation became tighter. It is estimated that Sassoon, Chinese merchants, the Tianjin gang, and foreign firms settled spot British gold four pints six two five and five six two five from foreign banks Datong Huabi Youli and a certain bank, and spot US exchange rate from seven yuan six two five to half a yuan. At the same time, speculators also bought this month's US exchange rate seven yuan five six two five and November's US exchange rate seven yuan four three seven five and three seven five from a certain bank Youli. It was already noon. The noon closing bank spot selling price British gold four pints five six two five, US exchange rate seven yuan half, this month's British gold four pints five three one two five, US exchange rate seven yuan four three seven five, November's British gold four pints four six eight seven five, US exchange rate seven yuan three one two five. As a result, compared to the previous day, the current British exchange rate is tighter zero six two five, the US exchange rate is softer two five. The swap spread continues to widen. There is no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Exchange Rate Spot Market Tightens Sharply</p>

The "United Note" black market rose slightly by half a yuan, to 86 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Weakens, Gold Market Continues to Prosper</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold market continued to rise due to the aftereffects of the previous day and the morning's weakening foreign exchange rates. However, the gains were limited. The opening price was raised to 4,020 yuan, but the momentum was slightly suppressed by the gold dealers. It once fell back to a low of 3,998 yuan. Subsequently, the securities firms suddenly bought on behalf of their clients, and the foreign exchange continued to weaken, causing bargain hunters to enter the market, pushing the high price of 4,028 yuan back before the close. The closing price was 4,023 yuan, a gain of 35 yuan compared to the previous day. It was rumored that after the close, the money exchange houses also bought on behalf of their clients. In the afternoon, the highest off-market price was seen at 4,045 yuan, but towards the end, the jewelers and retail investors sold off, bringing the price back to 4,020 yuan. According to the afternoon's foreign exchange settlement price, calculated at 4s 5.625d per pound sterling, it amounted to about 4,391 yuan (a premium of 370 yuan). Calculated at 7.5 yuan per US dollar, it amounted to about 4,670 yuan (a premium of 650 yuan). The premium was higher than the previous day, probably due to a certain gold dealer selling heavily. Trading was still brisk in the morning, with a volume of about 700 taels. Jewelry gold rose first and then fell, but ultimately remained unchanged. Customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Gold Exceeds 4,000 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially carried on the momentum of the previous day, coupled with the weakening of foreign exchange rates. The brokers' cries were very loud, and the sellers' asking prices were particularly high. The opening price was raised sharply by 32 yuan. The jewelers bought from the money exchange houses at 4,020 yuan per ten taels. After the opening, a certain gold dealer suddenly began to sell heavily, and the jewelers and retail investors also stopped buying and started selling. Shortly thereafter, the price fell back by a small 22 yuan. A certain gold dealer sold 30 taels to the money exchange houses at 3,998 yuan. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange continued to weaken, more buyers emerged, while sellers watched from the sidelines. At that time, the securities firms were actively pushing up the price, and it rose again by 30 yuan. The securities firms bought 20 taels from the money exchange houses at a price of 4,028 yuan. After this, a certain gold dealer resumed selling, and retail investors and cash gold dealers also took profits. Although a certain money exchange house bought on behalf of its clients, the position was still felt to be ample for a time. Before long, the price fell back by a small 13 yuan. Gold dealers traded 30 taels among themselves, and the money exchange houses bought 20 taels from the jewelers, both at a price of 4,015 yuan. At noon, the selling pressure eased slightly, and the upward momentum was revived, pushing the price up another 8 yuan. A certain money exchange house bought 40 taels from the gold dealers at 4,023 yuan, as the noon closing price. As a result, the price rose 35 yuan compared to the previous day. It was noted that it had risen for two consecutive days, for a total increase of 83 yuan. It was rumored that after the close, a certain money exchange house became more eager to buy, and raised the price by more than 10 yuan. A certain money exchange house bought 10 taels from a peer at a price of 4,040 yuan. In the afternoon, Saturday was a holiday for settlement, and it was reported that there was still some trading off-market, with the highest price being 4,045 yuan. A certain gold dealer and money exchange house sold off, and the price ultimately fell back to 4,020 yuan. The cash gold dealers' own gold was sold at a premium of 4 or 5 yuan over the cash gold price, and the buying price was about 30 yuan lower than the selling price. The current margin gold was bought and sold at about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, but no transactions were reported.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Rises First, Then Falls Back</p>
<p>At first, the jewelers' jewelry gold was quoted at 405 yuan per tael, the same as the Da Tong Hang. Then, at 1:52 PM, it was raised by 5 yuan. Later, at 4:05 PM, it fell back by a small 5 yuan, and ultimately there was no change. The Da Tong Hang still quoted the original price of 405 yuan. The Xin Tong Hang quoted the same price. The buying price was about 20 yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Securities: Rumors of Peace Again, Government Bonds Rise Again, Foreign Stocks Actively Traded</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities market initially continued to fall, but rumors re-emerged in the afternoon, and the upward momentum resumed. After the noon close, there were rumors of a Sino-Japanese ceasefire. Although known to be baseless, the market was stimulated after two consecutive days of declines, and there was also a shift in types. Most of the transactions involved selling Class C shares and buying other types. Furthermore, large investors gradually absorbed shares, showing signs of regrouping. If the atmosphere of peace becomes more pronounced, there may be a second wave of price increases in the future. Yesterday's trading volume was relatively lower due to Saturday. Buyers, adhering to the principle of the 20th, continued to absorb shares. Da Feng and Song Mao also showed strong buying interest, but Tian Sheng and Yong Kang continued to be sold off in large quantities. Hong Da Tong Kang also tended to sell. Therefore, the noon close was still down by a small 3 or 4 jiao. After the close, rumors suddenly emerged, and sentiment changed abruptly, so afternoon trading was also more active. The exchange of Da Qing and Da Sheng shares was quite lively, and there was a particularly high demand for Class B shares. Lian Yi and Xie Da bought in, and retail investors actively covered their short positions. The selling pressure was relatively weak. Class C and E shares broke through the 7 yuan mark again, and Class B shares even reached 9 yuan. The market once again showed signs of being easy to rise and difficult to fall. In terms of market prices, except for Class D shares, which were not traded in the afternoon, they were down by a small 4 jiao. The rest had rebounded by 3 or 4 jiao to 9 jiao. The total number of transactions was about 60 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>In the stock market, 50 shares of the Shanghai Cloth Exchange were traded at a price of 40 yuan and 2.5 jiao, which was said to be firmer than before. Yesterday's market at the Public Association was lively. Rui Rong shares rose sharply to 14 yuan, which was particularly noteworthy. Other stocks did not change much. The general public's interest has now spread to the entire market. The trading volume of rubber stocks was also considerable.</p>
<p>Next Monday's settlement will be very large. For the sake of specialization, the market will suspend morning trading at that time, and resume the normal afternoon session at 2:30 PM.</p>
<p>London, 13th - Today's London Stock Exchange prices for Far East companies' stocks: Gulangyu Rubber shares fell 2 pence to 15 shillings and 7 pence. The rest were flat.</p>
<p>London, 13th - Today's London Stock Exchange prices for Chinese foreign debt: The trend was stable. There were no changes in any of the bond prices.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Buying Interest Resurges</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market continued to advance. Initially, HSBC had an appetite for buying British and American exchange, and Tianjin banks and Sassoon also scrambled to buy, leading to a potentially weak market. After the Hong Kong banks actively purchased gold, it also broke through the 4,000 yuan mark again. All of this was enough to boost buying interest, so US dollar notes initially rose to 13.23 yuan, and then rose further to 5.25 jiao. Other currencies also rose sharply. In the afternoon, the market suddenly heard news from the Tongmenghui that the British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr had met with Foreign Minister Wang before flying to Rong. The agency believed that the British ambassador was once again mediating the Sino-Japanese War, which led to the sudden disappearance of buying interest, and the market turned slightly weaker. US dollar notes ultimately ended at 13.42 yuan, a high increase of 3.2 jiao. British pounds also rose 5 jiao, gold notes rose 7 jiao, US dollars rose 1 yuan, French franc notes rose 5 li, Singapore notes rose 1.5 jiao, Canadian notes rose 3 jiao, and Japanese gold notes also tended to be firm, ultimately ending at 1.36 yuan, up 1.2 li compared to the previous day. Korean notes were very stable, with the price still standing at 1.157 yuan. Everything else was unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn, Yarn Market Lingers, Large Investors Continue to Sell, Actual Sales Rely Only on Coarse Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market saw a slight increase, but the trend remained weak. In general, it did not break free of the lingering state. People were mostly optimistic, but actual sales were slow and uninspired. Hong Kong buyers purchased mostly 10s and 12s coarse yarn, but the amount was minimal. Mainland buyers also bought coarse yarn, but other buyers made no moves. Judging from the overall situation, the market is unlikely to see a new look unless customer sales develop. According to market reports, a certain large investor continued to sell, but the quantity was not as large as in the past, probably preparing to change course. Another theory is that there is too much stockpiled goods, and temporarily selling it off would reduce some risk.</p>
<p>Due to the heavy rain in the morning, the streets were flooded, and traffic was inconvenient, so attendees arrived late. The market did not open until 10:00 AM. 20s Shuangma yarn was priced at 720 yuan, up 5 yuan. Shortly thereafter, peers bought and raised the price by another 4 yuan, but actual demand was still sluggish, and the price fell again. There was not much change in the middle, and it was generally sluggish and listless. It was found that the half-day trading volume was 910 bales, compared to 225 bales on the previous day. 20s Shuangma yarn rose 6 yuan, and the rest was similar to the previous day. Today, 50 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Haiphong. The amount purchased by each buyer is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 140 bales</p>
<p>Peers: 600 bales</p>
<p>Mainland: 140 bales</p>
<p>Ningbo: 30 bales</p>
<p>Total: 910 bales</p>
<h3>Cotton Trading, Chinese Factories Halt</h3>
<p>Cotton trading remained quiet. Chinese factories halted purchases, and Japanese factories' needs were even more scattered. Shanghai factories traded slightly, buying 400 bales of Changyinsha packed cotton, but there were no other major moves. Sales of Tongzhou cotton were particularly slow, but prices remained stable, about the same as the previous day. Sources from Northern Jiangsu: Tongzhou cotton 1,590 bales, North Sha cotton 2,160 bales. Exports today included 665 bales shipped to Hong Kong. The current cotton situation is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Tongzhou: 134.00 yuan, Peers: 100 bales</p>
<p>Changyin Packed: 141.50 yuan, Shanghai: 400 bales</p>
<p>Pingguoer: 121.00 yuan, Hongzhang: 200 bales</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday's foreign cotton trading in Shanghai was tighter in exchange rates, and cotton prices rose by 3 to 5 yuan per picul. Traders' sentiment therefore became firmer. However, the factory's purchase of raw cotton was still extremely weak. Traders yesterday ordered 500 bales of American cotton for spinning 20s yarn in December, and the price was very cheap. According to current exchange rates, it is only about 170 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: New York cotton market was initially dull due to the enthusiastic purchases of traders. Later, due to the short selling of Southern traders, the market became fatigued. As a result, closing prices, except for the near term, were unchanged. Long-term contracts fell 2 to 3 points compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market was very firm, rising 5 rupees or more yesterday, including forecasts. Egyptian cotton fell more than 10 pounds. Liverpool rose 4 pence.</p>
<h3>Grains: Autumn Rain Turns into a Wetland, Rice Prices Firm</h3>
<p>The autumn rain was torrential, the river tide was high, and Shanghai was almost entirely a wetland. Therefore, there were few rice buyers. No goods arrived from the river, and only 4,000+ packages were shipped by wheels, so although trading was sparse, the buyers' sentiments were quite firm. Broken glutinous rice, new japonica rice, 100-grain rice, and sheep-reed rice prices all held the original board. Due to yesterday's price hike, the market for sharp rice was sluggish and showed a softening trend, with some falling by 2-3 jiao. The total trading volume in the general market was only 3-4,000 packages. Changshu and Wuxi broken japonica rice markets had no high-quality goods, only the middle market traded at 30 yuan, and the secondary market at 27-28 yuan. Suzhou and Kunshan high-quality broken rice traded at 30 yuan, 29 yuan, and secondary at 27 yuan, new japonica at 27.7 yuan to 26.7 yuan. Zhuanqiao old broken new japonica traded at 23 yuan. Greenhorn Kiln seed traded at 29 yuan. White paddy traded at 28-29 yuan. Fengjia 100-grain special traded at 28 yuan, market at 27.5 yuan, 27 yuan, medium at 26.5 yuan. Sheep sharp special traded at 23.2 yuan, secondary to 21 yuan. Reed sharp special traded at 23.5 yuan, secondary to 22 yuan. Jiangbei sharp traded at 18.8 yuan to 18.5 jiao. Wuhu sharp special traded at 19.3 yuan, secondary to 18 yuan. Chongji sharp traded at 17.5 yuan, sharp traded at 17 yuan. Nanjing special sharp traded at 19.6 jiao, secondary to 18.5 jiao. Bianyuan old traded at 31-32 yuan, 30 yuan, new at 16.5 yuan to 26 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the heavy wind and rain, trading in sharp japonica rice was sluggish. Actual buyers were deeply concerned that the shipping would be affected by moisture and stopped operating. Transient hoarding was also looking on. Flood-affected goods that had been immersed in water in the godowns were all eager to lower prices to avoid late sales. The quality of the new rice was relatively poor, and although the bags had been changed, it was still difficult to store for long. Very few buyers arrived in both the upper and lower markets. Supply exceeded demand, and market prices immediately fell. High-quality rice fell by a small 2-3 jiao, and medium to poor quality flood-affected rice fell by a small 3-4 jiao to 6-7 jiao. Fewer than 2,000 packages were traded, with nearly 4,000 stones still arriving.</p>
<h3>Reprocessed Flour Prices Exceed Factory Prices, Green Artillery Car 7.15 Yuan</h3>
<p>Flour: Since customer sales have been active, although Northern and Southern merchants have not moved large quantities, retail sales have not declined. The number of godown receipts in the market is decreasing, and the wheat market has also shown an upward trend. Sentiments are uniformly firm, but trading is not lively due to the weekend. Factories are also unwilling to supply large quantities. It is heard that the price of Green Artillery Car flour has exceeded the factory price and reached 7.15 yuan. Red and Blue Car and Red and Blue Fuxin brands are only available for small-batch retail in the local market, and the factory price is still 7 yuan. It is also heard that the Japanese Phoenix brand is expected to rise sharply, with the price rising from 6.6 jiao to over 6.8 yuan. Today, 10,300 packages of flour were exported to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Wheat: Recently, production prices have been high, merchants have decreased, and the supply of foreign wheat has been difficult to plan. Sellers' psychology is quite firm and they are stubbornly holding on. However, factories are choosing carefully and buying selectively, and hoarders are also not urgently demanding it, so the market is becoming more rigid. As a result, no formal transaction was concluded.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Beans and Sesame Weaken, Vegetable Oil Arrivals Still Many</h3>
<p>In the past two days, the sesame and soybean markets have both been declining, because goods are arriving from all routes, and most of them are of medium to poor quality. Currently, the various sellers are taking a "take high profits or kill" approach, because interest in buying is still not enthusiastic due to the lack of high-quality goods. Yesterday, sesame trading was more lively than other goods. A total of 700 packages of Yangzhou sesame were traded, with prices ranging from 26.3 yuan to 28.05 yuan. 300 packages of Hankou sesame were traded at a price of 31 yuan. More than 190 packages of Nanjing sesame were traded at a price of 31 yuan and 30.08 yuan. 30 packages of Wuhu sesame were traded at a price of 30 yuan. Only 100 packages of Taicang soybeans were traded at a price of 13 yuan and 12.9 jiao, and 200 packages of Wuhu soybeans were traded at a price of 13.1 jiao to 12.5 jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 2,640 pieces and 6,300 cans of vegetable oil were shipped from Tianjin. Today, 1,100 cans and 150 pieces were exported to Hong Kong. Today, 300 packages of soybeans and 300 packages of sesame were shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: White Sugar Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>According to a Dutch telegram, the production price of sugar has risen again. The price of immediate shipment of coarse white sugar has risen to 9.80 Dutch guilders, so the Public Association's planning board has once again raised prices, ranging from 1 yuan to several jiao. The current price of 24 coarse white sugar in a local godown is 51.5 yuan, for 200 packages, 52.5 yuan in a foreign godown, for 300 packages, and 52.3 yuan, for 400 packages. Transshipment goods cost 40.55 yuan to 40.7 yuan. Taikoo CX white sugar costs 56.3 yuan for B mark in East godown, 56.7 yuan for West godown, CW mark 56.2 yuan, CX mark 55.7 yuan, DY mark 55.2 yuan, and HX mark 54.7 yuan. The H mark car red sugar costs 39 yuan to 39.5 yuan, and Dutch red has reappeared at the 40 yuan mark, costing 40.5 yuan to 41 yuan. The local Mian white Zhen Ji No. 1 costs 52.5 yuan, and Nos. 2, 3, and 4 are tax-refunded. Local rock sugar has increased by 1 yuan and a half, with No. 1 costing 64 yuan, and Jingming rock sugar costs 65.5 yuan. It is heard that there has been some off-market trading of Green red sugar for the local sugar, and the price is cheaper, but the details are not known.</p>
<h3>Market Conditions Summary</h3>
<p>Fresh Jinan peach meat has recently been in short supply, and the market is very popular. Market stock is extremely scarce, so the higher prices are called at 140 yuan, and the second-best at 130 yuan, which is 20-30 yuan higher than the initial market opening price.</p>
<p>The discount rate for exchange drafts initially rose high and then returned to flat yesterday. The initial rate was 60 yuan per thousand yuan, once rising to 65 yuan at noon, and still the original rate in the afternoon, 7.5 yuan higher than the previous day. The interest rate of the Money Industry Association did not change, and both the morning and afternoon markets hung at 1.9 jiao.</p>

<h3>Occupying the Shanghai West Construction Factory, Counterfeit Allied Forces Establish Headquarters, Posting Absurd Notices and Slogans Everywhere, Innocent Passersby Suffer Torture for Inquiring</h3>
<p>After a certain faction organized the so-called "Special Task Force" in the extraterritorial road area, it occupied No. 66 Caojiazhai the day before yesterday, organized the so-called "Peace Allied Forces," and posted slogans in the Shanghai West area to promote a certain faction. Yesterday morning, they suddenly occupied the Guiji Construction Factory at No. 250 Bailinan Road (at the intersection of Yidingpan Road) and established a "Military Headquarters," hanging a wooden sign at the entrance with the words "Headquarters of Changying Troops of the Peace Allied Forces." They also posted "Notices" on key roads nearby, the content of which was all absurd arguments in support of a certain faction. The previously occupied houses have been converted into the "Training Center" of the army. Both places are guarded by armed personnel. The "uniforms" worn by these people are similar to those of the "Special Task Force," also green, but the color is darker. The military caps they wear are round, similar to those used by the Japanese army, with cloth leggings and yellow rubber shoes. The attire is slightly neater than that of the "Special Task Force." It is said that the day before yesterday, a middle-aged man surnamed Qian was passing by the gate of a certain team department on Jessfield Road. Out of curiosity, he stood and looked inside. A sentry saw him and, without asking why, dragged him into the house. A civil defense notice was found in his felt hat. They made a big fuss, falsely accusing him of being a spy, and began to interrogate him. Despite being severely tortured, he did not confess anything. He only claimed that his hat was too big, so he used the paper to pad it and had no other intentions. Later, Mr. Qian's relatives heard the news and hired someone to intercede. They paid 150 yuan in legal tender before he was released.</p>
<h3>Heavy Rain Poured Down Yesterday Morning, Shanghai Suffered Unprecedented Flooding, Total Rainfall Was 3.82 Inches, Coinciding with High Tide and Unfavorable Wind Direction, Ditch Water Backed Up and Roads Became Wetlands</h3>
<p>Heavy rain poured down in the city yesterday morning. It coincided with high tide and a strong southeasterly wind. Seawater surged into the Huangpu River, ditch water backed up, and the roads were flooded everywhere. The water was so deep that boats could be rowed. The extent of the flooding was even greater than the previous time when a hurricane struck Shanghai and caused a sudden high tide. It can be said that it was an unprecedented flood in Shanghai in recent times. According to a senior official of Shanghai Telephone Company, a telephone line was damaged, and 200 telephone subscribers in the area bounded by Suzhou Road in the south, Ningbo Road in the north, Yuemingyuan Road in the west, and Jiangxi Road in the east could not enjoy telephone service. However, the company has rushed to repair it, and it is expected that it will be fully restored today. Yesterday afternoon, the weather turned sunny and the climate was abnormally hot. Due to the high tide, the accumulated water on the roads had not completely receded by night. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Torrential Rain is Rare</p>
<p>The rain yesterday morning started at 11:15 PM the day before yesterday. The intensity of the rain between 6:15 AM and 7:45 AM yesterday morning was rare. According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the rainfall during this time was 85 mm.</p>
<p>After 8:00 AM, the Rain Slowed Down</p>
<p>The rain slowed down slightly from 8:00 AM, and the raindrops stopped slightly at 9:00 AM. In total, the rainfall from the start of the rain the day before yesterday at 11:00 PM to 9:00 AM yesterday was 96.6 mm, equivalent to 3.81 inches. The sudden intensity of the rainfall can be seen.</p>
<p>Total Rainfall Yesterday</p>
<p>From 9:30 AM yesterday, the raindrops continued to fall, but the intensity was sparse. It stopped at about 11:00 AM. The continued rainfall was 0.5 mm. According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the total rainfall yesterday was 97.1 mm, equivalent to 3.82 inches.</p>
<p>Roads Everywhere, a Vast Ocean</p>
<p>Due to the torrential rain and the inability of the drainage ditches to discharge the water in time, the roads were flooded everywhere, such as Nanjing Road, Zhejiang Road, Guangxi Road, Yinghua Street, Baike Road, Aiwanyi Road, Gansu Road, Wuding Road, Fuxu Road, Sapo Sai Road, Jessfield Road, Yuyuan Road, Dumei Road, and Xifei Road, all of which were a vast ocean. The water was so deep in places that it could reach the knees.</p>
<p>Huangpu River High Tide, Adding Insult to Injury</p>
<p>It was found that the Huangpu River had a high tide at 0:15 AM yesterday, and the quantity was between 2.5 and 2.5 inches close to the Bund embankment. When the rain was heaviest yesterday morning, the tide had not yet receded, so the water level of the Huangpu River was almost at the same level as the bank. The sewers of the road began to spew water, and the water on the ground began to flood.</p>
<p>Vehicular Traffic is Obstructed</p>
<p>There were few pedestrians on the road in the heavy rain yesterday morning, and the stores were deserted. In terms of traffic, due to the flooding of the roads, buses and trams were slowed down and driven through the water. Some were stalled due to the depth of the water. The Xifei Road tram tracks had not been running yesterday afternoon. Private cars and rickshaws circled in the water, as if they were punting in the heart of the waves, a spectacular sight. Pedestrians on the roads had to rely on vehicles all day long. Even if there was only a short distance between them, they had to use rickshaws to ferry them across. Most of the cars had their fuel tanks flooded and broke down along the way. Civilians waded through the water barefoot, and everyone lamented while walking.</p>
<p>Weather Cleared Up, Accumulated Water Not Exhausted</p>
<p>From yesterday afternoon, the sun shone and the weather cleared up, but the accumulated water on the roads had not completely receded by night. The reason is that the Huangpu River continued to have a high tide at 1:02 PM yesterday, and the quantity still reached 12 feet. The tide water flowed back from the sewers, so there was no way for the water on the ground to be discharged. It was found that the Huangpu River still has a high tide today, so it is difficult to expect the accumulated water on the low-lying roads to recede. Also, the weather was hot and humid after the rain yesterday, the highest temperature was 85.5 degrees, and the atmospheric pressure was low, so the weather is likely to change.</p>
<p>Tram Service Suspended, Traffic Mostly Interrupted</p>
<p>After 6:00 AM yesterday morning, the trams and buses on each route routinely left the factory for business. Due to the heavy rain, many factories were flooded. The water depth in front of the Xianshi Company in the Public Concession and the Shanzhong Road area in the French Concession was still several feet. The accumulated water was the deepest on Carter Road and Sapo Sai Road, so all trams on routes 1 and 2 were suspended. Only a few trams on other routes were not suspended, but five or six out of ten of them were running in the water.</p>
<p>Sleeping Soundly in Water, Rescue Too Late</p>
<p>Zhang Jinchao, a 23-year-old Jiangyin native, was working as a handyman at the Tongrong Iron Factory on Dunxin Road in Shanghai West. Zhang worked the night shift at the factory the night before. After finishing work, he slept on the floor of the factory. Yesterday morning, heavy rain poured down, and the factory was also flooded, becoming a wetland. Zhang Jinchao was too tired from working and slept soundly, immersed in the water. Yesterday morning at about 10:00 AM, another worker caught a glimpse of him, called him but received no response, so he went forward and helped him up. He was already unconscious and barely breathing. He hired a car to take him to the Red Cross Hospital, but he died before reaching the hospital. The U.S. Consul Will Host a Banquet</p>
<h3>U.S. Commissioner to the Philippines Will Pass Through Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>The U.S. Consul Will Host a Banquet</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, Mr. Saya, the new U.S. Commissioner to the Philippine Islands, is traveling to Manila to take office on the President Cleveland. He will pass through Shanghai on Sunday. Mr. Gauss, the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, will hold an informal banquet at the Columbia Country Club on the same day from 5:00 to 6:00 PM to entertain Mr. Saya. It has been announced that Mr. Saya's stay in Shanghai will be limited to residing on the ship, so the U.S. expatriates do not intend to officially entertain him. According to the U.S. Consulate, the consulate does not issue invitations individually, but invites general U.S. expatriates by announcing it in the newspaper. Mr. Saya was originally an assistant to the Secretary of State. Mr. McNutt, the former Commissioner to the Philippines, had previously returned to Washington to resign, and Mr. Saya was appointed to succeed him.</p>
<h3>New Annerley Steamer Trial Voyage to Xinghua, Not Allowed to Enter Port</h3>
<p>The Company Declares a Temporary Rerouting</p>
<p>It is learned that the new Annerley steamer has arrived in Xinghua and is anchored outside the Sanjiang Estuary, but has not been allowed to enter the port. It is unknown whether it was blocked by Japanese warships. According to Taichangxiang Company, the ship has temporarily suspended its voyage to Fujian and rerouted to another line. However, it did not disclose where it was going.</p>
<h3>Absolutely Domestically Sold Tea, No Need to Settle Foreign Exchange When Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously stated that tea, whether for domestic sale or transported to Shanghai, must be purchased with foreign exchange, and telegraphed the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance to explain. The Trade Commission replied by telegram that the matter of tea exports from various provinces this year should be handled by the local offices of the Chamber, together with the provincial government and the China Tea Company, to carefully identify and approve tea that is absolutely for domestic sale. The Chamber will issue a certificate, and the China Tea Company will declare it for export. Therefore, in the future, for tea that is absolutely for domestic sale, if transported to Shanghai, it must be handled in accordance with the above procedures, so there is no need to settle foreign exchange. It is hoped that this will be checked and handled accordingly.</p>
<h3>Police Department Superintendent Retires After Completion of Term</h3>
<p>Mr. Laur, superintendent of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, has been in office for 25 and a half years. He will retire today after completing his term and leave Shanghai for Australia via England. Mr. Bowen, the Inspector General of the Police Department, and other Western senior detectives held a banquet at the Police Department Club on Fuzhou Road on the afternoon of the 13th to bid farewell to Mr. Laur, as a sign of remembrance. During the banquet, Inspector General Bowen presented Mr. and Mrs. Laur with wooden combs, silver horses, silver toys, etc. as souvenirs. It is said that Mr. Laur made many contributions to the Police Department during his 25 years in office and has received many awards.</p>
<h3>West Shanghai Puppet Police Plan to Take Over Traffic Lights; Large Numbers of Chinese and Foreign Police Rushed to the Scene; Puppet Police Retreat Upon Seeing the Situation Was Not Favorable</h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reported that police from the "Special Municipal Government Police Bureau" forcibly ordered Indian police from the Public Concession Police Department to close traffic lights at an important intersection on Yih Ting Pan Road West at 10:40 AM yesterday (the 13th), causing temporary chaos and nearly leading to incidents at the two intersections. The Jing'an Temple Police Station dispatched additional police officers to the two locations, and the "Special Municipal Police Bureau" eventually withdrew the police officers who had caused the dispute, and the matter subsided. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Forcibly Ordering Indian Police to Close Traffic Lights</p>
<p>The Jiangwan authorities attempted to seize complete control of traffic management in the Yih Ting Pan Road area within the British defense zone. Without prior warning, they dispatched police officers carrying rifles in formation to the two intersections on Yih Ting Pan Road, forcibly ordering the on-duty Indian police officers to close the traffic lights. The Indian police officers were forced to comply. As soon as they were able to leave their posts, they immediately reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station using the police department's street telephone.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Police Rush to Suppress</p>
<p>The police station immediately dispatched teams of Chinese and foreign police officers. It was estimated that the traffic lights at the intersection of Yu Yuan Road and Yih Ting Pan Road were stopped for three minutes, and the traffic lights at the intersection of Da Xi Road and Yih Ting Pan Road were stopped for ten minutes. However, after the police department dispatched 20 additional police officers to each of the two intersections, the "Special Municipal Government" police immediately yielded, and the police department officers resumed using traffic lights to direct traffic.</p>
<p>Jiangwan Police Also Withdraw</p>
<p>Approximately one hour later, the additional police officers dispatched by Jiangwan (one of whom was carrying a hand-held machine gun and stationed at the intersection of Yu Yuan Road and Yih Ting Pan Road) all withdrew from the two intersections. Shortly thereafter, the police department also recalled the reinforcements. At the same time, senior police officers from the police department arrived at the scene to inspect the two intersections and the intersection of Yih Ting Pan Road and Dun Xin Road, where the number of "Municipal Government" police had increased. Assistant Superintendent Kirk and Sampson, as well as several other senior police officers, also arrived at the scene.</p>
<p>British Military Commander Personally Inspects</p>
<p>Major General Simmons, the commander of the British garrison in Shanghai, and Major Ashmore also personally went to the scene of the incident to inspect. Shortly after the incident, "Special Municipal Government" personnel in military uniforms and carrying rifles patrolled the area in several trucks, stopping at various important intersections, but they did not get out of the vehicles when they arrived at the intersections on Yih Ting Pan Road.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Heavy Rain; Puppet Police Embarrassed</p>
<p>The puppet police had previously attempted to seize traffic control rights at the intersection of Yih Ting Pan Road and Yu Yuan Road and the intersection of Yih Ting Pan Road and Da Xi Road. Although the positions at both locations were flooded yesterday, the police station still dispatched additional detectives to guard the areas separately as a precaution. At the intersection of Yu Yuan Road and Di Feng Road, the water was knee-deep. The puppet police stationed there were soaked by the rain and stood barefoot on the window bars beside the shop doors, looking quite embarrassed.</p>
<h3>Branches of the Bank of Communications Expected to Resume Operations Tomorrow; Will Continue to Pay Out at Original Locations; Japanese Occupy Third and Fourth Floors and Have Not Withdrawn</h3>
<p>The inland retreat branches of the Bank of Communications, after the former site of the Bank of Communications headquarters at 10 Hankou Road was forcibly requisitioned by the Japanese Military Police Headquarters, entered the premises yesterday to reorganize and hold meetings with branch managers to prepare for the resumption of payments. In addition, they telegraphed the headquarters to report and request instructions on how to proceed and announced a postponement of the recruitment examination for probationary staff. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Staff Enter to Reorganize Everything</p>
<p>The retreat branches operating at the former site of the Bank of Communications headquarters include: (1) the Provisional Liaison Office for branches in the Zhejiang area, including branches in the occupied areas of Zhejiang, such as Hangzhou, Wuxing, and Jiaxing; (2) the Provisional Liaison Office for branches in the Shanghai area, including branches along the Jinghu Road and Jinpu Road lines, such as Zhenjiang and Xuzhou; (3) the Provisional Liaison Office for branches in the Zhen area, including branches in the Jiangbei area, such as Taixing and Nantong. The establishment of the Provisional Liaison Office at 73 was intended to temporarily handle deposits from people in the occupied areas at various locations. After being forced to suspend operations starting the day before yesterday, the staff of the retreat branches entered the premises yesterday morning to reorganize everything and prepare for the resumption of payments.</p>
<p>Telegraphing the Headquarters to Request Instructions</p>
<p>In addition to telegraphed the headquarters the night before last to report the details of what happened and request instructions on how to proceed, the Shanghai branch of the bank convened an informal meeting of branch managers yesterday afternoon to discuss the aftermath. In order to facilitate payments to depositors in various locations, they plan to resume payments at the retreat branches starting on Monday, October 16. However, whether to do so at the original site or find another location for a temporary office depends on instructions to be telegraphed from headquarters. According to the "Newspaper Society" reporter's inquiries at the bank yesterday, the retreat branches, in light of the fact that the original site was forcibly requisitioned by the Japanese but the situation was not serious, plan to resume payments at the original site starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>Japanese Occupy and Have Not Withdrawn</p>
<p>The doormen and patrolmen at the former headquarters on Hankou Road near the Bund resumed their duties as usual yesterday morning. All staff members enter and exit through the back door on Hankou Road. However, personnel from the Japanese Military Police Headquarters are still occupying the third and fourth floors of the building, reportedly for use as dormitories for the Japanese Military Police Headquarters. As of last night, the occupation had not ended, and the Japanese had not withdrawn. However, the Japanese enter and exit through the main gate at 10 Hankou Road. Inside the gate is a post manned by plainclothes Japanese personnel. The gate, which had been tightly closed for a long time after the war, was forcibly opened by plainclothes Japanese personnel starting the day before yesterday. However, the Japanese do not interfere with the activities of the staff members on the second floor and lower levels.</p>
<p>Recruitment Examination for Staff Postponed</p>
<p>After the Bank of Communications staff training class was forced to suspend classes, the bank announced a postponement of the recruitment examination for probationary staff. A notice issued yesterday stated: "The bank originally scheduled the examination for October 15 and had notified applicants separately at the time of registration. Due to procedural reasons, we are unable to proceed as scheduled. We will announce the date and location at a later time. This is hereby notified." It is also understood that the examination questions and all relevant documents for the recruitment examination for probationary staff could not be taken out in advance. The bank is currently in negotiations to ensure that the examination can continue to be held.</p>
<p>Negotiations Are Still Underway</p>
<p>The "Newspaper Society" reporter learned from sources yesterday that the police department had negotiated with the Japanese regarding the Japanese Military Police Headquarters' forcible occupation of the former site of the Bank of Communications headquarters. The negotiations are still underway. The Bank of Communications is awaiting the outcome of the negotiations by the concession authorities. As of last night, there was no news of a resolution. However, the Bank of Communications hopes that the Japanese will withdraw, as there is no spare room available for rent in the building, so that the staff training class will not be forced to suspend classes and the recruitment examination for probationary staff can be held as usual. In addition, the documents and equipment for the training class are still on the third and fourth floors and have not yet been moved out.</p>
<p>Municipal Council Scheduled to Discuss Next Week</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the Municipal Council had not taken any action regarding this matter. However, Mr. Philippe, the General Manager and President of the Municipal Council, told reporters that the council intends to decide what steps to take regarding the seizure of the Bank of Communications building by the Japanese Military Police on the 13th within the next week. It is believed that the Municipal Council will decide on the attitude to be taken towards this illegal action at the regular board meeting to be held next Wednesday (the 18th) afternoon.</p>

<h3>Foreign Postal Ships to Arrive Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Sailing Schedules of Ships from Allied Nations Difficult to Ascertain</p>
<p>Due to the impact of the European War, the sailing schedules of postal ships from various countries are uncertain. Ships from the Allied nations maintain strict secrecy, so external knowledge of sailing schedules is completely lacking. The latest developments are summarized below:</p>
<p>American President Lines</p>
<p>"President Cleveland"</p>
<p>The "President" was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 11th of this month, but due to a delay in departure from Los Angeles, it will now arrive at 1:15 PM today, berthing at buoys 11 and 12. The passenger tender "Mary Mahler" departed from the Customs Wharf at 1:15 PM today and returned with passengers to the Customs Wharf at 3:00 PM. The ship is scheduled to weigh anchor and depart for Hong Kong at 10:00 AM tomorrow. The final tender "Little Luzon" will depart from the Customs Wharf at 8:30 AM tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Chang Hing Company</p>
<p>"Empress of Russia"</p>
<p>The ship came to Shanghai from Vancouver earlier this month and went to Hong Kong.

<h3>Iron Netting Added at the End of North Jiangxi Road</h3>
<p>To the east of the barbed wire fence erected by the Japanese army at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Bazi Road, there was previously a plainclothes Japanese soldier to prevent scavengers from crossing the area. When the reporter visited the area yesterday afternoon, the plainclothes Japanese soldier had been withdrawn, and the barbed wire fence had been thickened with several layers. Scavengers residing in Zhabei who do not have permits will no longer be able to pass through the area. According to residents in the area, in addition to forcibly injecting vaccinations, the Japanese army notified residents that they must have vaccination certificates to obtain resident permits when they first took over the new defense zone. Although this has not been implemented, many residents have moved out due to the inconvenience of living in the special area of Hongkou. Landlords have posted notices everywhere due to the vacant houses, but there are few inquiries.</p>

<h3>Two Tram Companies Take Back Damaged Tokens</h3>
<p>New Tokens to Be Discontinued Immediately</p>
<p>The token notes of the tram companies in the two concessions were discontinued after the Bank of China issued fractional currency notes. However, because the fractional currency notes did not circulate smoothly, the tokens were reissued after eight days. Recently, because the Bank of China has issued all 500,000 fractional currency notes and the circulation in the market has gradually increased, a second batch of 500,000 is about to be issued. It has been learned that the company has stopped issuing tokens starting today and has instructed all ticket sellers to collect damaged tokens and not to reissue them.</p>
<h3>Rails on Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Damaged; Passenger Train Derails Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>A passenger from Hangzhou who arrived last night said that the early train from Hangzhou to Shanghai derailed shortly after passing Linping at 6:00 AM yesterday morning because the rails had been destroyed by a mobile unit of the Chinese army. Many Japanese soldiers and passengers were killed or injured. After hearing the news, the Japanese army in Hangzhou sent an engineering train to the scene of the accident to repair the damaged rails. The passenger train that departed from Hangzhou at 1:00 PM arrived in Shanghai last night. According to the passenger, a locomotive and several first and second class cars were lying on the side of the road near Linping.</p>
<h3>Centenary Commemoration of Daguerre, Inventor of Photography; Aurora University Opens Photography Exhibition; Display of Lang Jingshan's Works</h3>
<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>In the last decade, the Chinese people's fondness for photography has developed widely. Groups studying photographic techniques exist everywhere, and many world-renowned works have been produced.</p>
<p>The merits of the person who invented photography are no less than those of Edison and Marconi. Yet there may be people who love photography and do not know who invented it. Is this not strange? We respect Edison and Marconi, but we cannot help but express our admiration for Daguerre, who invented photography! As we commemorate the centenary of Daguerre's invention of photography, we should first introduce Daguerre himself.</p>
<p>Daguerre, Louis Jacques Mandé, was French, born on November 18, 1789, in Cormeilles, Seine-et-Oise. He was originally a painter. In 1822, he opened a panorama studio in Paris and also established one in London. In 1826, Daguerre began to study photography with Niépce. Soon after, he studied it on his own. After thirteen years of painstaking effort, he finally succeeded. In 1839, it was made public to the world. This year marks the centenary. Daguerre passed away on July 12, 1851. The film used by Daguerre at that time was a metal plate. Later, through the inventions of countless people, it went from metal plate to glass plate, and even to today's film. However, when we trace the source of the invention, we always attribute it to Mr. Daguerre.</p>
<p>The Aurora University Photography Research Society, in commemoration of the centenary of Daguerre's invention of photography, is holding a Lang Jingshan Photography Exhibition. Lang's works are rich in pictorial and poetic meaning. The compositions he adopts are harmonious and beautiful, making people feel like they are seeing a painting. This is universally admired by Chinese and foreigners alike.</p>
<p>Lang recently returned from a tour of the southwest. He has taken more than a hundred famous photos in various provinces (which have been printed by the China Travel Service in a book called "Scenery of the Southwest," which was sold yesterday at the Aurora University venue). All of them have been enlarged and sent to the Aurora Exhibition. We all yearn for the active appearance of the southwest. Now, after seeing these famous works, it is as if we are in the southwest, and the entire potential of the southwest is revealed to us one by one.</p>
<p>The exhibition opened yesterday afternoon. Although the roads were flooded, the attendance was still very enthusiastic, with more than 300 people. At 2:00 PM, Father Cailmeng, the president of Aurora University, gave a short speech, followed by a speech by Dr. Ferguson. Everyone could understand what Mr. Ferguson said in Chinese. He said: "We should not only admire Daguerre's greatness in inventing photography, but we should also strive to learn Daguerre's spirit of research. Now, only Mr. Lang Jingshan has this spirit, so he can have great success."</p>
<p>These few words aroused enthusiastic applause from the entire audience. Undoubtedly, Mr. Lang can truly accept it without shame! Lang is a member of the Royal Photographic Societies of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Belgium, as well as a member of the Photographic Society of America. He has won 58 awards at photography exhibitions around the world. Lang is the first Chinese person to receive this honor. Now, excerpts from Lang's published commemorative text are listed below:</p>
<p>I have been deeply interested in photography since I was a child. I often think that the images of things in the universe can be transmitted far and wide and preserved for a long time, while still resembling the scenes at the time. There is no way to do this other than photography. This kind of image preservation is more accurate than the description of words and pictures. The wedding photos of my late father seventy years ago still vividly show the scene at that time.</p>
<p>This year's bumper harvest in Sichuan can supply needs for ten years. Although it is due to the endowment of fertile land, the contribution of water conservancy is also great. Its water conservancy project is an ancient method from thousands of years ago. Now, by using photography, it can be easily studied and referenced by people from various countries. Other similar approaches can be assisted by photography and widely disseminated or discussed. From this, we can know that photography has a huge relationship with society and various academic disciplines.</p>
<p>In recent years, fine art photography in various countries around the world has been refined. In addition to the mechanical function of recording images, people seek for artistic interest. It has transformed from mechanical to artistic, and its progress is amazing. The composition and principles adopted are mostly the same as those of Chinese painting. For example, combining several films and printing them into one is like Chinese painters arbitrarily taking and discarding scenery, creating an ideal new realm. This is one method.</p>
<p>Although photography has advanced into the realm of art, it is not only for personal enjoyment, but also returns to culture. Therefore, it makes great efforts to contribute its functions to industry, medicine, and other fields. In short, any invention or promotion of science must aim at human happiness in order to have an indelible value. With this in mind, we are once again reminded of the invention of photography by the pioneer Daguerre. Because of his invention, we have entered today's advanced field, and his achievements are very great. Now, on the centenary commemoration of Daguerre's photography, and the third anniversary of the Aurora Photography Research Society, I am honored to be asked by the president of Aurora University to publicly exhibit my photographic works here for commemoration. Therefore, we have set the opening ceremony for October 14 in the auditorium of the new building of Aurora University. We respectfully hope that all distinguished guests will come to visit and instruct us. Starting the next day, tickets will be sold, and all proceeds will be used by the Aurora Photography Research Society to promote medical research and photography equipment. Starting November 1, there will be another exhibition for five days. The proceeds from the tickets will be used to help the refugees in the mainland. However, a cup of water cannot save a cartload of burning firewood, and the humble intention is thankfully noted by all sectors.</p>
<p>The exhibition is open to the public today, but only for this one day. Everyone, I think, will not miss this opportunity.</p>

<h3>Auspicious Day, Good Time, Bride Refuses to Get Into Sedan Chair; Suddenly Changes Her Mind After Agreeing; Groom's Family Disappointed and Files Case for Negotiation</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 3:00 PM, at the intersection of Route Paul Henry and Avenue Albert in the French Concession, a strange incident occurred in which the bride was hidden away by her father-in-law and the marriage was refused. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Employed as a Postal Worker</p>
<p>Wang Guantao, a native of Ningbo, is 26 years old. He lives at 33 Lane K, Xitaihua Lane, North Jiangxi Road. His parents are still alive. After leaving school at the age of 19, Wang was admitted to the Shanghai Postal Administration and worked as a postal assistant. He was highly regarded by the authorities for his diligence. In June of this year, he was promoted to postal worker.</p>
<p>The Mi Family Has a Daughter</p>
<p>A fellow townsman of Wang's named Mi Qinshu, 44 years old, has been operating a Xinhetai tobacco and sundries shop at 518 West Route Paul Henry for many years. Mi has a beloved daughter named Mi Weiji, 29 years old, who is quite beautiful. She graduated from the Cunde Primary School at 14 Gu Baal Road.</p>
<p>Formal Engagement</p>
<p>Through the matchmakers Wang Yihua (representing the groom's family) and Ye Hongzeng (representing the bride's family) and witnesses Zhu Chengyuan and Sun Wenyuan, the Wang and Mi families formally engaged on the 15th day of the fourth lunar month of this year. The bride's family requested a bride price of 320 yuan, gold jewelry worth 200 yuan, and clothing expenses of 60 yuan, all of which were provided by the groom's family.</p>
<p>Refusal to Marry</p>
<p>Two months ago, the groom's family specially hired the famous Shanghai astrologer Zhen Zuobi to choose an auspicious wedding day. As a result, it was decided that the wedding ceremony would be held on the 14th of this month (yesterday) at the Fuxing Garden Restaurant on Wuma Road. The matchmakers and witnesses notified the bride's family. However, on September 4, the Wang family suddenly received a letter from the Mi family stating that the bride had recently suffered from stomach problems and requesting a postponement. At that time, the groom's family, in view of the fact that an auspicious day had already been chosen, was reluctant to change it rashly. However, the bride's family firmly refused.</p>
<p>Negotiations for the Wedding</p>
<p>The Wang family had no choice but to file a petition with the Second Special District Court requesting mediation to fulfill the marriage. On September 19, the court held a hearing. The bride's family hired lawyer Shen Zongyong to represent them in court. Mediation failed. Then, they went to lawyer Shen's office for negotiations. At that time, the father-in-law, Mi Qinshu, and the bride, Mi Weiji, both attended in person. As a result, both parties agreed to the wedding yesterday. Mi Qinshu wrote a letter promising to do so on the spot.</p>
<p>Suddenly Changes Face Again</p>
<p>The groom's family, believing that this matter had gone through legal procedures, expected that there would be no changes. They sent out wedding invitations to notify relatives and friends. Yesterday, the auspicious day arrived. At 3:00 PM, the groom's family specially hired a decorated sedan chair to go to the bride's house to pick her up. However, when the chair arrived at the Mi residence, the father-in-law suddenly reneged on the previous agreement and refused to go through with the wedding, claiming that the bride's stomach pain had not healed and that she was not suitable to pass through the door.</p>
<p>Photographing as Evidence</p>
<p>At that time, the groom's family knew that the father-in-law was intentionally making things difficult. They temporarily hired Dr. Simon from Guangci Hospital to diagnose the bride to determine whether she really had a disease. However, this was also rejected by the bride's family. At this point, the groom's family had no choice but to take a photo of the decorated sedan chair parked in front of the bride's house and report the incident to the Songshan Road Police Station to file a case, deciding to sue according to law. At that time, the water on Route Paul Henry was knee-deep, and onlookers stood in the water to witness this rare and strange event.</p>
<h3>Sewing Employee Poisoned by Eating Crab</h3>
<p>Stomach Pain in the Middle of the Night; Sent to Hospital for Treatment</p>
<p>Wang Yuangao, a native of Ningbo, 33 years old, is working as a tailor in the clothing department of the Japanese-owned Fuki Company at 222 Qiwupu Road. The night before last, Wang bought three large crabs and happily cooked and ate them. He then went to bed. However, in the middle of the night, he suddenly felt stomach pain, which worsened by dawn. He groaned continuously. When his companions learned of the incident, they summoned an ambulance at approximately 6:00 AM yesterday morning and sent Wang to the Hudong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>World Christian Student Special Public Prayer</h3>
<p>Held Today in Various Parts of the World; Grand Gathering of Students in This City</p>
<p>The World Christian Student Federation has launched a temporary student public prayer, to be held on October 15 in various parts of the world, to pray for truth and peace. The Joint Committee of Christian Student Groups in this city has scheduled a citywide student public prayer to be held at 2:00 PM today at St. Peter's Church at the intersection of Avenue Road and Chengdu Road.

<h3>Jiuru Money Shop Robbery Case; Reward for Arrest; Main Criminal is the Shop's Driver</h3>
<p>The Jiuru Money Shop at 84 West Seward Road in Hongkou was robbed of a total of 190,000 yuan in cash and other valuables the day before yesterday. It was later discovered that Chen Qingtao (also known as Yu A'gen), a driver from Chongming employed by the shop, was the mastermind of the crime. In addition to the police department's strict efforts to arrest and bring him to justice, the shop has offered a reward of 15,000 yuan for the arrest of the criminal.</p>
<h3>Teahouse Owner Shot Dead</h3>
<p>Shen Hanting, a native of Anhui, 49 years old, has a wife, Chen, and a son, Xi Ji, 25 years old. Shen has considerable potential influence in the Hongqiao Road area. People call him the Anhui Boss. Last fall, Shen opened the Wanjiang Tea Garden at 379 East of the Wenshu Academy on Hongqiao Road, also operating a hot water stove. The business was not bad. Shen's whole family lived in the shop. The night before last (the 13th) at 8:30 PM, Shen went out to visit a friend. When he walked to a small alley nearby to the east (60-70 yards from his home), he was suddenly shot by an enemy. He was hit in a vital area and fell to the ground and died on the spot. When the police arrived after hearing the sound, the murderer had already escaped. Shen had already died of his injuries. After the incident, residents in the area went to watch, only to learn that Shen Hanting had been shot and killed. They notified Shen's family. The police station in the refugee area reported to the Lujiawan Police Station. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuantang mortuary for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, the prosecutor assigned by the Second Special Court arrived at the scene for an autopsy. The autopsy determined that the deceased Shen Hanting had indeed been shot and killed. The body was handed over to his son to prepare a coffin and collect the body, and to await the arrest of the murderer.</p>
<h3>Notice of Sudden Suspension of Postal Money Orders to Fenghua</h3>
<p>Postal money order services between Shanghai and Fenghua city have been temporarily suspended by the Shanghai Post Office starting yesterday. However, postal money order services between Shanghai and the two localities of Xikou and Huizheng Bridge, which are under the jurisdiction of Fenghua County, will continue as usual. According to inquiries made by reporters at the Domestic Remittance Management Office of the Shanghai Postal Administration, the reason for the suspension of remittances between Shanghai and Fenghua is due to omissions in the Zhejiang District remittance clearing list recently sent to Shanghai by the Zhejiang Postal Administration. A letter has been sent to the Zhejiang Administration for inquiry. However, until a reply is received, all Shanghai post offices will temporarily suspend the issuance of money orders to Fenghua County.</p>
<h3>Shooting Occurs in a High-Class Brothel on Pingwang Street; Two Japanese Nationals Injured, One Prostitute Killed</h3>
<p>At approximately 9:00 PM last night, in the Meijuan high-class brothel, No. 26 Pingwang Lane, Pingwang Street, Guangdong Road, Li Dingshi, identified as an official from the "Avenue Municipal Government" and "Director of the Public Works Bureau," was treating Meijuan to drinks. Japanese guests were also present, and a lavish banquet was in full swing, with many women in attendance, creating a lively atmosphere. Unexpectedly, at around 10:30 PM, as the guests and hosts were enjoying themselves, two men dressed in blue cotton long gowns and another man dressed in a gray cotton long gown suddenly came up the stairs, barged into the room, and without saying a word, pulled out box-type pistols from their pockets and opened fire.</p>
<p>Bullets Like a String of Pearls</p>
<p>The guests present were greatly alarmed and scattered in all directions. However, two Japanese guests who were in the direct line of fire, and Sanbao (15 years old), a young prostitute from the Xiaoqiaohong high-class brothel in Huile Lane, were unable to dodge in time and were hit by stray bullets. Sanbao, after being hit in the head (temple) by a stray bullet, did not realize it at first and tried to escape, but collapsed and</p>
<p>Died on the Doorstep</p>
<p>of the Meimei Brothel.</p>
<p>As for the two Japanese nationals who were hit by stray bullets, it is reported that one was hit in the chest and the other in the arm. They reportedly tried to fight back after seeing that the assailants had emptied their first round of bullets, and were subsequently struck on the head with the gun butts. The assailants then hastily fled downstairs, leaving the second round of bullets at the entrance of the stairs. After the incident, Chinese Detective Yun Fuxun and Western Detective Zhang Peilin of the Laozha Police Station immediately arrived at the scene.</p>
<p>Immediately Arrived</p>
<p>They urgently transported the injured Japanese to Fumin Hospital. At the same time, Japanese police officers also arrived to conduct an investigation. According to subsequent investigations, one of the injured Japanese nationals was identified as Ikeda, while the other's identity is unknown. Sanbao of Xiaoqiaohong was summoned by a Wang surname guest and was sitting facing the door when the shooting occurred. Next to her was another prostitute named Tanchun, who escaped injury by quickly lying on the ground,</p>
<p>Avoiding Disaster</p>
<p>Which was fortunate. People from the Meijuan brothel and other related persons were all taken to the police station for questioning after the incident. At the same time, nearby establishments such as the Meinengzhen Restaurant were also thoroughly inspected. A row of bullets was also taken to the police station for study, and orders were given to pursue and arrest the criminals.</p>
<h3>Women Brawl, Yang Shen Dies</h3>
<p>Yang Shen, a woman residing at No. 7, Lane 1161, Haining Road, suddenly got into an argument with Zhu Shi, a woman living in the same residence, and her 18-year-old daughter, Zhu Er'nan, over a minor matter yesterday. They engaged in a physical altercation. Shortly thereafter, Yang Shen's face turned pale, and she was rushed to the Refugee Hospital on North Xizang Road for treatment, but it was too late, and she died. Ji Xiuquan, a detective from the Huisi Police Station, was dispatched to transport the body to the mortuary for examination and detained the Zhu mother and daughter at the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the police station, requested a postponement because the coroner's report was not yet available. Judge Jiang ordered a postponement for further review.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Province Asks for Exemption from Foreign Exchange Settlement for Medicinal Materials</h3>
<p>Since the Zhejiang Customs was ordered to announce that "all native goods shipped to Shanghai must be settled in foreign exchange," the volume of goods shipped from Ningbo to Shanghai has decreased sharply. Merchants of native products from Ningbo and Shaoxing have requested modifications. It is reported that the Yin County Pharmaceutical Industry Association believes that native medicinal materials from various counties in Zhejiang Province and those transshipped to Shanghai through the interior all use Ningbo as an export hub. Once foreign exchange settlement is implemented, costs will rise sharply, inevitably affecting exports and pushing pharmaceutical merchants and farmers into a desperate situation. They have petitioned the Ministry of Finance to consider the commercial situation, withdraw the order, and exempt them from foreign exchange settlement.</p>
<h3>Increase in Airmail Rates to Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration announces that from today, the additional airmail surcharge for all airmail letters destined for Indochina, British India, Malaya, Siam, Burma, India, and Iran, carried by British Imperial Airways planes departing from Hong Kong, will be uniformly increased to 65 cents in national currency per five grams. The same increase will apply to airmail letters arriving from various Western locations and carried by the company's Hanoi-Hong Kong leg.</p>
<h3>Nehru's Autobiography Published</h3>
<p>Jawaharlal Nehru, leader of the Indian National Congress, visited China in August and was warmly welcomed by all sectors. Born into a wealthy family, he dedicated himself to the national revolution. His international reputation is comparable to that of Mahatma Gandhi, and he is also highly literary. The famous British writer, Miss Ottoline Morrell, once called him one of the eleven greatest contemporary writers. Several years ago, while in prison, he wrote an "Autobiography," narrating his lifelong struggle. The National Association of Chinese Youth Associations, with the author's consent, entrusted Hu Zhongchi, Mei Yi, Feng Binfu, and Kuai Si to translate it into Chinese. The entire book consists of 300,000 words, is beautifully written, and includes a portrait of Nehru and his personal letter to the Chinese people. It has already been published and is being distributed by the Youth Association Bookstore on Museum Road. The price is two yuan for the paperback and two yuan and fifty cents for the hardcover.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's meteorological forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday states that the Shandong area is clear with southwest to southeast winds. The weather here is cloudy and quite hot, with no fixed wind direction. There was fog in the morning. The East China Sea will change from cloudy to overcast with showers and no fixed wind direction.

<h3>Four Workers Sentenced to Death in the Hengfeng Textile Mill Fire Case</h3>
<p>In the past, fires frequently occurred in the Hongkou area. The Japanese side believed that they were caused by Chinese anti-Japanese arson groups. After the fire at the Hengfeng No. 2 Textile Mill in Hongkou on May 9, four workers were identified by the Japanese side within the factory. The Japanese side subsequently announced that those arrested were members of the arson group, led by a Zhang who was at large. It is now reported that the four workers who were identified by the Japanese side as arsonists were all sentenced to death by the Japanese military tribunal yesterday.</p>
<h3>Kidnapped Elementary School Student: Relatives and Accomplices Involved; Ransom Recovered, All Gang Members Arrested</h3>
<p>Wu Aju, a resident of Wangting, Suzhou, had some savings. Recently, she brought her eleven-year-old son, Wu Guorong, to Shanghai from her hometown and lodged him at No. 5, Wuzhen Road Bridge, XinZha Road, with her relative Xue Guanming. She also enrolled Guorong in Hande Elementary School at No. 345 Park Road. At noon on August 30 of this year, Wu Guorong,</p>
<p>Returning Home from School</p>
<p>When passing the intersection of Park Road and XinZha Road, he was kidnapped by several gangsters. Subsequently, Wu Aju received a threatening letter from the gang demanding a ransom of 5,000 yuan. Wu reported the incident to the XinZha Police Station. Most recently, Chinese Detective Zhai Jiaju and Pang Ruiqing of the Laozha Police Station discovered that the kidnapping of Wu Guorong</p>
<p>Was Masterminded by His Relative</p>
<p>Xue Guanming. After reporting to Chinese Chief Detective You Agen, Xue Guanming and his accomplices Wu Shengwu, Mao Apan, and Wu Ming were apprehended at Room 100 of the Zhejiang Road Garden Hotel.

<p>The authorities managed to rescue the hostage on the 10th of this month. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Ru Baoyi, a lawyer from the police station, filed charges of kidnapping for ransom. Following this, Wu Aju submitted a petition stating that after being kidnapped, he was initially hidden in Zhou Bin's house, then moved to a certain hotel, and later moved to Pudong. After the court questioned the defendants,</p>
<p>After Questioning by the Court</p>
<p>The defendants' defense lawyer, Tao Wuzhi, argued. Judge Feng Shide then announced the end of the debate and scheduled the announcement of the verdict.</p>

<h3>How to Train Your Brain</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>People rely on their hands and brains to do things. The brain is an organ that receives sensations and initiates reactions; it's the commander-in-chief of the entire body. A person's success or failure, intelligence or foolishness, is greatly related to the agility of their thinking. Inventors, politicians, military strategists, and writers – all of them create great achievements through their intelligent brains. For example, a military leader on the front lines, without a smart brain, cannot make decisions from thousands of miles away. Similarly, a great politician who manages internal affairs, if he doesn't have correct thinking, will turn the country into a chaotic mess, causing suffering for the entire nation. The examples above are about major issues concerning the nation and its people. As for personal matters, there are countless instances of people making a single mistake that leads to lifelong regret. Physical disability is certainly unfortunate, but unsound thinking causes even greater pain. Therefore, how should we train our brains?</p>
<p>When a person is born, their brain is pure, without any bad thoughts. So why are there thieves in society? These people's thinking has gone bad, and they are willing to commit crimes. Who wants to be a bad person? I can say that no one does, but to prevent one's thinking from going bad, one must train the brain from an early age.</p>
<p>Children! Your brains are all pure, but why are some smart and others not? Because some are willing to train their brains, while others are not. But children must be asking me, how do we train our brains?</p>
<p>Training the brain isn't difficult. We just need to read more and write more. When we don't understand something, we should think about it more and not just ask the teacher without trying. We must make our thinking correct, not distorted. When something shouldn't be done, no matter how much people try to entice or persuade us, we must show firm resolve and reject them. And when something should be done, even if it means facing danger, we must do it regardless. Since ancient times, there have been loyal ministers and treacherous officials, all differentiated by a single thought. Children are still young, and they will bear great responsibilities for the country in the future. Therefore, how should you train your brains well, to make them sound, correct, and smart? Because your lifelong happiness depends entirely on it. Brain training must start from a young age; it's useless when you're older. Foolish children should train actively, and even smart children should train into exceptional minds, so that they can accomplish great deeds in the future. The country's future and your personal happiness are heavily dependent on the brain.</p>
<h3>The Tiger</h3>
<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>The tiger, pursued by hunters, was shot several times and seriously wounded. Bleeding, it fled, with the hunters hot on its heels. Soon, it reached the edge of a cliff, finding itself with no escape and its life in danger. Suddenly, it glimpsed a pair of adorable cubs frolicking on the grassland below the cliff. Focusing its gaze, it realized they were its sons. It roared loudly, about to jump off the cliff and die beside its sons, when it heard the sound of the hunters' footsteps, growing closer along the trail of blood. If it jumped off the cliff at that moment, it would lead the hunters to discover its sons. But, if it didn't kill the hunters, they would sooner or later find its sons. To protect its offspring, it gave up on suicide and chose to fight.</p>
<p>It quickly lay on its back in the grass, enduring the groans, holding its breath, and conserving its last bit of energy. A moment later, the hunters searched to its side. It leaped up and wrestled with the hunters. After a long struggle, the tiger and the hunters collapsed to the ground, dead.</p>
<p>Its sons continued to frolic lively on the grassland, completely unaware that their mother had fought bravely and died to protect them.</p>

<h3>Entering the City</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>—Ming'er's Refuge Diary, Part 38—</p>
<p>After a night of wind and a day of rain, the temperature in the atmosphere dropped significantly as the wind blew and the rain fell continuously. The sunlight had long been blocked by the rain clouds, unable to penetrate. Sometimes it peeked out from the clouds, but disappeared in an instant. When the wind had passed and the rain had stopped, the sky was as clean as jade, and the tender sunlight shone on the earth, also reducing its temperature. People often felt the stimulation of cold air on their bodies. It was already late December, approaching the Gregorian New Year. No wonder the weather was getting colder. Ming'er had spent more than a month of leisurely and peaceful days in that village. There were no planes, no soldiers, and no news of the outside world. Everyone lived their lives peacefully, truly a haven in the human world, a Shangri-La in a time of chaos. However, the prices of goods from other provinces had soared to exorbitant levels, while the local products of the nearby villages were, in Ming'er's eyes, cheaper than cheap—sweet potatoes for one jiao per ten catties, eggs for one yuan sixty or seventy, and firewood and charcoal for one yuan three or four hundred catties—so Ming'er ate eggs every day, for breakfast and dinner, and was getting tired of them.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they had two clear and warm days, but good times don't last. Next came cloudy weather, with no sunlight all day, and the temperature dropped even further. It was clearly a sign that snow was about to fall. All the heat in the air had been taken away by the snow, which further controlled the distribution of heat, heavily sealing the source of heat with dark clouds. It also unleashed the violence of the wind, roaring in the bare treetops, trying to drive the remaining heat to thousands of miles away. All of these scenes were a prelude to snowfall.</p>
<p>"After it snows, where will we go to buy vegetables?" This question was worrying Ming'er's mother, because for the past month, they had managed to get by thanks to the landlady constantly sending them vegetables and begging the neighbors to sell them some. Now, seeing the impending snowfall, she needed to urgently solve the problem of "food," because this problem was quite important. No wonder the old lady was anxious.</p>
<p>After inquiring around, they found out that the "vegetable" problem could be solved in the county town, which was more than ten li away from the village. So one afternoon, Ming'er and his older brother, carrying baskets and ropes, and their father, carrying a walking stick, set out on the road to the city. In normal times, buying vegetables was always the job of the maids, but during the escape, personally carrying baskets and going to the faraway city to buy vegetables was a first for the three of them.</p>
<p>In front, beside, behind, and on both sides of the legs were green bean fields, with the soybeans filling the ground, arranged in neat rows, and the plots divided clearly. The road was inlaid in the middle of these crisscrossing field banks. This journey of more than ten li was completed by their three pairs of feet in about an hour, and they stepped into the city.</p>
<p>The county town was very dilapidated. The battlements on the low city walls were scattered, and the withered weeds densely covered the walls, as if painting them with a layer of old age. The stone slab road was uneven, and one could easily get their foot caught in the cracks if they weren't careful. Although they had entered the city, pedestrians were scarce, and the people living in the county town seemed to be afraid of them, hiding in their homes and not daring to come out.</p>
<p>After turning two corners, there were more than twenty stone steps. They walked up the stone steps without much effort, and the ground was much lower. It turned out that the city walls were built on a small hill, and the terrain of the entire county town was very low-lying, resembling a basin. Therefore, the city walls only needed to be built so low to be sufficient. However, looking up in the city, they appeared巍然高大。</p>
<h3>The Blue Dwarf (4)</h3>
<p>— Ai Li</p>
<p>The uncle smiled, answering each of A Li's questions. However, A Li stood beside the sofa, looking at the aunt very seriously, and quietly asked, "Aunt, please answer my question seriously, is there really a dwarf country in the world?" It turned out that she thought the aunt's explanation to A Li was just an excuse, afraid that A Li would be afraid of dwarfs in the future, so she deliberately made it sound so bland and ordinary. She had previously read geography and knew that the Laplanders and Finns in Northern Europe were all very short, which could be considered dwarf countries. But she didn't know if there were dwarfs living in the nearby forests, because geography books never mentioned this. The aunt was older and had been here before, so she should know very clearly. Moreover, she had just clearly seen a dwarf walking past the window. Perhaps there were many dwarfs like him living in that forest? And the blue dwarfs made in porcelain might be modeled after them. It would be best to verify it, that would be interesting.</p>
<p>A Li thought to herself, "According to A Li's guess, those blue dwarfs in the porcelain factories might be made according to real dwarfs. Next time I walk through the forest, I must pay attention to see if there are any dwarfs living there."</p>
<p>These thoughts were swirling in A Li's mind. Her eyes were fixed on her aunt's face as she asked very seriously, "Aunt, do you say that dwarfs are really a type of human?" The aunt said solemnly, "Yes, why would I lie to you? We don't need to mention this question again. Hurry up and pack everything up, your uncle has prepared the car."</p>
<p>The uncle chimed in, "Yes, it's prepared. A Li, but I'm sorry, this car is not an ox cart, because we need to hurry on our way and cannot sit in an ox cart and walk slowly through the forest. The car I have prepared is a very good carriage, it drives very fast. But we also have to stop for a while after driving for one or two hours, partly to let the horses rest and feed them something, otherwise we won't be able to continue on our way tonight."</p>
<p>The aunt took the packages and luggage, and walked out the door with A Li and A Li, asking, "You said we should stop for a while on the way, where do you plan to stop?" The uncle said, "There is a small village in the middle of the forest, and there are people there who can take care of the horses. We ourselves also need to sit down for a while and have a cup of coffee. I remember that I had been to this beautiful and lovely little village before, and I also want to linger there for a moment now."</p>
<p>A Li was listening attentively, and couldn't help but mutter to herself, "A beautiful and lovely little village in the forest! That place may be very close to where the dwarfs live, and it's not far from here. Didn't we just see the old dwarf?"</p>
<p>After they all got into the car, the coachman cracked the whip and the car moved forward. Although it was afternoon, the weather was still very hot, and the first part of the road was bland and uninteresting. Later, the road gradually opened up, and they arrived in the wilderness and entered a large pine forest. A Li became happy and quickly asked her uncle, "Uncle, is this a very big forest?" The uncle was a little tired and answered casually, "Yes, very big, very big." Then there were no more words. A Li looked up and saw that he and her aunt had both drooped their heads, as if they were about to fall asleep. But A Li was very excited and had no intention of sleeping. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Monkey and the Spectacles</h3>
<p>—Krylov's Fable—</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a monkey, old and with failing eyesight. He heard people say, "This misfortune is not so serious, as long as you have a pair of spectacles." So he took half a dozen pairs of spectacles and looked at them upside down, glancing at this side and that side. At one moment he put the spectacles on his neck, at another moment he put them on his tail. He sniffed them a few times and licked them a few times, but the spectacles were still of no use to his eyesight.</p>
<p>The monkey cried out, "Alas! Why do those foolish creatures listen to the words of idle people? The spectacles they speak of are nothing but lies!" So he took the spectacles and threw them against a stone, smashing them to pieces.</p>
<p>We say things are bad, but in reality, we ourselves do not understand. (Translated by Zhao Yilin) Helping Effect</p>

<p>Entertainment World Mao Zedong Lan Ping</p>
<h3>Marriage Not a Fact</h3>
<p>— Pei Fei</p>
<p>Last month, Reuters telegraphed that Mao Zedong would marry actress Lan Ping in Chongqing, which caused a sensation in Shanghai. Everyone regarded it as a romantic anecdote in the political world and a fascinating story in the art world.</p>
<p>The news about Lan Ping (real name Li Yunhe) marrying Mao was first spread in Shanghai, but it was not actually by Reuters; as early as two months ago, Qu Shigong, who specializes in writing "Anecdotes from the Drama World," had already revealed this news in the film and drama weekly of the Sino-American Daily. The difference between the news spread by the two was that Qu Shigong said that Lan Ping had already been living with Mao Zedong, while Reuters said that Mao Zedong would marry Lan Ping.</p>
<p>Recently, according to a letter from a friend in northern Shaanxi: the news spread in Shanghai about "already living together" or "about to get married" is all inaccurate.</p>
<p>He said: "It is a fact that Lan Ping and Mao Zedong are quite close, but marriage is out of the question. The reason and justification are: First, Mao Zedong is a so-called 'married man.' The Communist Party strictly enforces monogamy. As the administrative leader here, he would never do such a 'sexually promiscuous' thing; Second, Lan Ping and Mao Zedong are both people with strong will and rationality, and they would not easily play love games like ordinary people.</p>
<p>"Yes, maybe some people think 'there is no smoke without fire'; then, how could the news be misrepresented? The thing is like this: In the past, Lan Ping was a student at the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University of the Red Army in Fushui. Mao Zedong served as a professor of 'Dialectical Materialism' in this school. They met because of their teacher-student relationship. Later, Lan Ping graduated and went to serve as a female student instructor at the Lu Xun Academy of Arts. Because she had a strong desire for knowledge, she often went to Mao Zedong to ask for some knowledge. At this time, by chance, Mao's wife, Ms. He Zizhen, ran to the Soviet Union to study at Moscow University. Ordinary short-sighted people saw them often talking together and, without thinking, released rumors that the two were in love..."</p>
<p>That friend is an art instructor at a school there, and he and Lan Ping are very close friends. It goes without saying that he must know Lan Ping's affairs very clearly, so I firmly believe that what he said in the letter is completely true, so I dare to excerpt it here as a refutation of rumors.</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang's Private Life (3)</h3>
<p>— Li Feishu</p>
<p>— Six of Random Memories by the Plum Blossom</p>
<p>Mr. Mei's gentle personality can be seen from these few examples. When he speaks to people, he sometimes hesitates, as if unable to express himself fully. However, when discussing matters and observing people, he has a clear understanding in his mind. He is approachable and never criticizes others. His ability to accept good advice is a key factor in his success. Whether it's about conduct and self-improvement or artistic matters, he doesn't necessarily listen to flattery, but he certainly embraces constructive criticism. All his friends who are close to him praise him for this!</p>
<p>He is courageous and persevering in his work. Although many things are accomplished with the help of friends, he is the central figure and can be considered the driving force. If his will were not firm, his friends would often give up halfway due to many difficulties. The previous trips to America and Russia involved many setbacks! If it weren't for his unwavering spirit, which sustained everyone's intermittent will, I dare say that Mr. Mei's life's work would have "accomplished nothing."</p>
<p>His thirst for knowledge is stronger than that of ordinary people. No matter what he encounters, he carefully investigates its truth, not stopping until he thoroughly understands its intricacies. Especially in regards to drama, he is not ashamed to ask questions and constantly strives for improvement. His innate inclination to improve is why he has reached this point today, with the encouragement of friends being secondary.</p>
<p>In short, his personality is very much in line with the essence of a poet (gentle and kind). In dealing with people, he is humble and courteous. As for art, drama can be considered his first life, which he maintains and cultivates tirelessly. As for his personal flaws, they are not entirely absent. For example, he is sometimes overly cautious, which can lead to indecisiveness. He is too kind to people, which makes him appear weak and easily deceived. Due to limited space here, I won't elaborate further.</p>
<p>New Film Introduction</p>
<h3>Bloodbath in Black Mountain (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"Each Dawn I Die"</p>
<p>Except for the final prison break scene, the entire film almost entirely depicts the righteous friendship between James and George Rafter, and George Rafter's generosity and uprightness in risking his life to clear James's name. Several scenes are very delicate and stirring. Such as: (1) The "close-ups" of George Rafter's intense gaze when James meets his mother and fiancée twice; (2) James's firm refusal to tell the truth after George Rafter's prison break; and the depiction of the dynamics of various prisoners in the factory, etc. The scene of George Rafter escaping from court is also very moving: first, it shows the Red Cross car and another car parked outside the courthouse; George Rafter's surprise when being photographed; James's surprise when watching from the window; the car horn signal; George Rafter jumping from the high building into the Red Cross car, then into another car... Every shot is stirring.</p>
<p>In the final prison break, amid the dense machine gun fire, George Rafter forces Polyte Kye to confess the process of plotting to harm James. After the warden agrees, George Rafter forcibly drags Polyte Kye out the door and dies together in a hail of bullets. The tense atmosphere is extremely strong.</p>
<p>James Cagney maintains his past performance, acting very well in several scenes such as being wrongly accused and firmly refusing to tell the truth. George Rafter is neither handsome nor skillful when playing the "young leading man," and his stiff movements prevent him from achieving much. In this film, because he is suited to the personality, he acts very calmly and powerfully.</p>

<h3>Turkey in Rapidly Evolving International Situation: The Anglo-French Group Strives to Win It Over; The Soviet Union Also Wishes to Shake Hands and Make Peace</h3>
<p>Hard Work is No Longer the Sick Man of the Far East</p>
<p>The newly emerged Turkey after the European War, due to its hard work and self-improvement over the past decade, has seen gradual progress in domestic politics and increasing prosperity in economic construction. It has become a major stronghold in the Near East. Western European powers such as Britain and France no longer regard it as the sick man of the Near East or treat it as their economic colony. Instead, they look at it with new eyes and strive to win it over, even to the extent of signing mutual assistance agreements with it. If Turkey is threatened by a European aggressor, Britain and France can come to its aid. The meaning of this is not that Western powers such as Britain and France genuinely care about collective security and are willing to risk war to help smaller nations, confronting aggressors to uphold so-called international justice; rather, it means that Turkey straddles Europe and Asia geographically, controlling the passage from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. If such a militarily important area were to be controlled by a powerful, militaristic country such as Germany, Germany's power would extend from Eastern Europe, through the Balkan Peninsula, and reach the Dardanelles Strait, as it did during the last World War. This would not only threaten the security of British and French colonies in the Near East but also pose the danger of controlling the Suez Canal, cutting off the vast British Empire, with colonies all over the world, in the middle. For this reason, the Turkish government was able to invoke the "change of circumstances" clause in 1936 to request the right to fortify the Dardanelles Strait, which was previously restricted from being fortified. After the Montreux Convention, Turkey finally achieved this goal, creating the prelude to cooperation between Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Turkey in the Mediterranean. This year, after Czechoslovakia was destroyed by Germany in March and Italy subsequently occupied Albania, the power of the Axis countries threatened to sweep through the Balkans and head straight for Istanbul (formerly Constantinople). Thus, Britain and Turkey signed a mutual assistance agreement in May, and France and Turkey resolved the Sanjak issue and established a mutual assistance agreement. All of this indicates that Turkey, under the leadership of its current leader, Ismet, has achieved great diplomatic success.</p>
<p>Current President Ismet's Policies</p>
<p>Ismet is the successor to Kemal. His name is Ismet Inonu. He was born in Izmir, and his surname is also related to this place because he defeated the Greek army there in the winter of 1922, so he received this glorious name. Like his predecessor, Kemal, he fought for the Turkish Revolution and the freedom of Turkey, leading the people towards a definite, active, and constructive direction to complete Turkey's cultural construction. His foreign policy is "closely related to collective security." He also said, "The policy of collective security, no matter how it changes, remains the remedy in this turbulent era and the only better foundation for building our ideal world."</p>
<p>Diplomatic Relations between Turkey, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France</p>
<p>Turkey's signing of a mutual assistance agreement with Britain and France can be said to be an expression of this ideal. In recent years, Turkey's signing of mutual assistance agreements with Britain and France naturally means that its relations with Britain and France are extremely close. However, Turkey is a country between the Soviet Union and Britain and France, and in the past, Turkish-Soviet diplomacy was also extremely friendly. We know that Kemal led the National Army from Ankara to resist Britain and France, defeated Greece, and received considerable assistance from the Soviet Union. Currently, Soviet-German relations are becoming closer, while Turkey is approaching Britain and France, which is something that the Soviet Union cannot feel at ease about. Now that Britain and France are at war with Germany, the Soviet Union is deeply concerned that Turkey may allow British and French navies to pass through the Dardanelles Strait, enter the Black Sea, destroy the Baku oil fields, or attack Soviet territory along the Black Sea coast. The Soviet Union naturally needs to require that belligerent warships not be allowed to pass through the aforementioned straits and to maintain good relations with Turkey, concluding a mutual assistance agreement. Turkey, in order to ensure its own security and maintain good relations with Britain and France, also needs to obtain Soviet recognition of the British-French-Turkish mutual assistance agreement and to agree with the Soviet Union to consolidate peace in the Eastern Mediterranean. Therefore, Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu made a trip to Moscow this time. According to reports, the result of the Turkish Foreign Minister's negotiations with the Soviet Union is that a defense agreement between Turkey and the Soviet Union has already been signed. This agreement stipulates that Turkey will close the straits in exchange for the Soviet Union's guarantee of the Balkans. This new diplomatic achievement of Turkey may prevent it from being dragged into the vortex of war and allow it to maintain its mutually benevolent neutrality.</p>
<p>Biographical Sketches</p>
<h3>The British Forward Commander-in-Chief, Viscount Gort, Who Once Served as the Commander-in-Chief of the British Garrison in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Xiuji</p>
<p>Viscount Gort, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army on the front lines on September 4th. General Gort was born in 1886, is currently 53 years old, and is the sixth-generation descendant of the Earl of Gort. During the European War, he was an army captain who led by example and made special achievements. In September 1918, he fought near Borosji and led his team to attack under enemy artillery fire. He was wounded by two bullets, but General Gort ignored them and continued to cooperate with allied mechanized units to complete the mission. In September 4th, he was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the British troops stationed in India as the commander of the army and the principal of the army school. General Gort is good at hunting, enjoys swimming, and is also a speedboat athlete. In 1933, he obtained a pilot's license and became an excellent pilot. Gort is famous for his courage and good fighting skills. In 1927, General Gort led the British Coldstream Guards to Shanghai and served as the commander of the British Army stationed in Shanghai. He once went to Japan. He then served as a general in his home country. He is not only an army talent but also a naval and air force talent. When Gort was the principal of the Kimbalesch Officer School, because of his extraordinary energy and fierce nature, the British Army Minister praised his ability and promoted him to the position of Chief of the Imperial General Staff. Now Gort has been reassigned as the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army on the front lines. As for the position he left behind, it has been taken over by Sir Aincit, the British Overseas Army Commander.</p>
<p>Economic Knowledge</p>
<h3>The Unpredictable and Volatile Cotton Yarn Market</h3>
<p>— Longsheng</p>
<p>Before the Sino-Japanese War, there was no distinction between spot goods and warehouse receipts in the cotton yarn trade. Warehouse receipts were representatives of spot goods. Buying a cotton yarn warehouse receipt meant that you could take the receipt to pick up the goods. Occasionally, if the production and consumption of a certain count of cotton yarn (for example: 6-count, 10-count coarse yarn, or 32-count, 40-count fine yarn, etc.) were not in sync, that is, when "demand exceeded supply," the factory could not deliver all the goods. Therefore, the factory would allocate the yarn according to the order of the warehouse receipt numbers, prioritizing customers with earlier numbers (i.e., those who purchased earlier). If a customer with a later number wanted the factory to expedite the delivery to meet urgent sales needs, they could pay an expedite fee of 10 to 20 yuan per piece to get the requested cotton yarn. This was an occasional and uncommon occurrence.</p>
<p>After the war, the Shanghai Special Zone became an isolated island and also became a haven for the floating capital of wealthy refugees! The rich had no way out for their money? So, in addition to buying gold bars and foreign exchange, they scrambled to hoard yarn, cloth, rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains!</p>
<p>Last year and this spring, 20-count cotton yarn, whether it was from Jincheng, Shuangma, Tiannv, Diqiu, Jinji, or other brands, was around 400 yuan. The difference between the brands was at most 10 or 20 yuan. The price of gold was rising slowly, foreign exchange was gradually tightening, and the source of cotton yarn raw materials, native cotton, was being manipulated and controlled. It seemed that a large supply of foreign cotton was necessary. Speculators who hoarded goods for profit saw the opportunity and desperately hoarded yarn! The price of Shuangma yarn (because it was selling well, everyone thought that Shuangma was the standard yarn) jumped from more than 400 yuan to a peak of 500 yuan! Because the factory issued too many warehouse receipts, it was difficult to cope with the distribution of spot goods. Therefore, the expedite fee was raised to several tens of yuan. At the same time, the market dealers in the market started trading cotton yarn with spot goods and warehouse receipts going their separate ways, each with its own market price. The price of spot goods became higher and higher, while the price of warehouse receipts became lower and lower. Spot goods and warehouse receipts, which were originally one and two, two and one, actually went in opposite directions. This was indeed a miracle in the isolated island cotton yarn market! Later (around the Dragon Boat Festival), the black market for foreign exchange was driven crazy by speculators who, regardless of the country's interests, went long and bought aggressively. In addition, a certain party disrupted the market by buying and selling at the same time. The shrinkage of foreign exchange (British pounds and US dollars) could not be stopped. Banks were facing a very serious situation due to the withdrawal of cash by speculative depositors! Then, like a bolt from the blue, the Ministry of Finance's "Ma" telegram came suddenly! (The Ma telegram limited depositors to withdrawing 500 yuan.) After the banks reopened after the Dragon Boat Festival, speculative depositors switched targets and frantically hoarded cotton yarn, drawing remittances and discounting them. Because of the urgent need for cash, the premiums also soared! (From 60-70 yuan to more than 200 yuan)</p>
<p>After the yarn market broke through the 500-yuan mark, it was like a runaway horse, heading straight for the highest peak. In addition, rumors spread like wildfire in the market, saying that the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee's funds would be exhausted, or that the committee would not maintain the black market, fearing that "inflation" would occur. All kinds of rumors abounded, maliciously slandering the fallacy that the legal tender was worthless, so speculative friends could take advantage of the fire and loot, muddying the waters to fish. 20-count cotton yarn went from more than 600 yuan to more than 700 yuan. In particular, the Shuangma brand yarn produced by Shenxin No. 9 Factory was in high demand (the Hong Kong and Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou gangs had a large appetite), and the production volume was relatively large (because 140-150 bales were produced day and night), so the price was particularly profitable. Tiannv, Diqiu, and Te Jincheng were the next most popular. Only Yong'an's Te Jincheng had higher quality. Sometimes it kept pace with Shuangma, and sometimes it was higher than Shuangma. The price of spot goods and warehouse receipts diverged sharply! For example, if the spot price was 700 yuan, the warehouse receipt price was only about 610-620 yuan. At this time, the 30-yuan deposit per piece for yarn warrants had long been canceled (it was still possible to make exceptions at 500 yuan, and speculative friends gained a lot of convenience. With a 300-yuan deposit for ten pieces of cotton yarn, they could get what they wanted.) Financial institutions also did not allow cotton yarn mortgages (when financial institutions did cotton yarn mortgages, large ones charged 70-75% of the market price). Therefore, friends who did spot yarn business had to show off with real strong financial resources. At a minimum, to do ten pieces, you needed to spend more than 7,000 yuan of capital (when the market price was at its sharpest, you needed to pay entirely in cash. For the most part, it was 3-7 payments, which is short for 70% remittance and 30% cash). Otherwise, don't even think about it. As for speculative traders who had remittance funds but no cash funds, then there was another unpredictable business method, that is, if the original yarn payment required 10,000 yuan in cash, it could be changed to a full remittance payment, which would require an additional 10%, for a total of 11,000 yuan. This way, the transaction could also be completed.</p>
<p>When the European war broke out in early September, although foreign exchange increased, the yarn price remained strong and profitable. This was because speculative friends had learned from the experience of the first European war. Moreover, the raw material of cotton yarn—cotton—native cotton was rigidly controlled, and the source of foreign cotton might have problems due to the European war? (This is excessive sensitivity!) Therefore, everyone scrambled to hoard endlessly. In addition, the British-Japanese confrontation situation in Hong Kong eased down, and the outlet for cotton yarn sales was unusually lively, and the yarn's foothold became stronger. As a result of the scramble for purchases from all parties, the peak of the Shuangma brand reached 880 yuan per piece (spot goods). Novice speculative friends, seeing the market situation, hoped for 1,000 yuan per piece and tried their best to collect cash to drag in. Unexpectedly, the cunning ones who were experienced in this way stopped and let the wild wind go, dangling in the shadows attached to the Japanese puppet peace movement! They spread rumors that Konoe and Chen Cheng had flown to Hong Kong to negotiate Sino-Japanese peace, and that there was a Sino-Japanese-German-Italian-Soviet five-nation alliance, etc.! Sure enough, the Guizhou trick was successful! The yarn price plummeted to the 800-yuan mark. Dazzled novice speculative friends were anxious to sell and sold off cheaply at 730-740 yuan. The cunning ones took the opportunity to buy in again. After two or three days, the atmosphere of peace disappeared without a trace. Novice speculative friends lost tens of thousands of yuan in just one day, which was not uncommon, while the cunning merchants were overjoyed and became rich! Since then, due to Foreign Minister Wang's peace talks, although public bonds rose sharply, foreign exchange was released, and the gold price plummeted, cotton yarn was able to be relatively stable, and the fluctuations were not too intense. Currently, Shuangma spot goods are standing firm at around 750 yuan, while the warehouse receipt price has gradually converged, and the difference from the spot price is only 30-40 yuan. Presumably, novice speculators know that it is difficult and have retreated? However, the above description can also give a glimpse of the general strange and unpredictable dynamics of the cotton yarn market. When will we see the light of day in this gambling-style black market and sweep it clean? "Note" The difference between spot goods and warehouse receipts is that after spot goods are priced high, they can be immediately delivered to the outer warehouse or factory. If you buy warehouse receipt goods at a low price, then this warehouse receipt will only be able to deliver spot yarn in two or three months or even half a year. The "spot yarn" delivery slip has no special credentials and is only a warehouse receipt. However, it is clearly marked with the words "spot goods" or "immediate delivery". Readers must know this.</p>

<h3>The New China Travel Troupe, Active Under Fire</h3>
<p>— Ciyun</p>
<p>This group of militarized young soldiers grew up healthy in the flames of war</p>
<p>The masters of the new China—children, were forged more robustly and strongly in the flames of war. When the roar of the guns of the July 7th Lugouqiao War of National Liberation sounded, the work of our New China Travel Troupe became even more tense and arduous. At this time, they were doing propaganda work in Suiyuan, a remote area in northern Inner Mongolia. The originally planned route was to develop towards the northwest. However, in view of the importance of the work, they went to places closer to the front line to intensify propaganda work. In June of last year, they arrived in Xi'an. At that time, the situation in Hankou was quite tense, so they specially rushed to Wuhan to participate in the defense of Greater Wuhan. Later, they withdrew from Wuhan and carried out propaganda in the southern part of the country, temporarily stationed in Guilin.</p>
<p>When this travel troupe was first established, our core personnel consisted of only a dozen people. However, after traversing such a vast area and for such a long time, we have absorbed many outstanding children from various places and aspects. Now there are a total of more than fifty people: including more than a dozen girls; the ages of these children range from the youngest eight years old to the oldest eighteen years old, and they are divided into two departments according to their age: the children's department and the youth department. In addition, the entire troupe has three instructors who are over twenty years old! These are old troupe members who have exceeded the prescribed age. There is also an advisor, who is already over thirty years old, but he feels very happy living in the children's circle.</p>
<p>This wandering team is divided into four collective departments that are responsible for leadership: the general affairs department is responsible for daily affairs and economic expenditures; the liaison department is responsible for contacting troupe members and members and for all external communication affairs; the self-education department is the characteristic of this wandering children's team, which is responsible for the education work of the entire troupe, and the library group learning group is compiled according to the literacy level of the troupe members; The propaganda department is the most important work of the entire troupe, responsible for all external propaganda affairs, and constantly preparing propaganda materials internally; each of the four departments has one director, and a cadre committee is established, and a general secretary is produced. , an advisor and three instructors are only of an auxiliary nature. In addition, the Southwest Working Team has recently been established, which is mainly responsible for doing propaganda work in the southwestern provinces; there is also the Wounded Soldiers Working Team, which is dedicated to comforting and serving the loyal and brave soldiers who are injured; there is also a department specifically responsible for training cadres, because the scope of work is gradually expanding, so new troupe members must be continuously absorbed.</p>
<p>The current schedule of life stationed in Guilin is arranged as follows: get up at 6:30 in the morning, practice climbing mountains for one hour for the whole group, wash your face for fifteen minutes, which is held by the river, and the children's department learns to dance for thirty minutes; at the same time, the youth department holds a life review meeting to review the life and learning experience of yesterday, and decide on the life and learning of today; singing together for thirty minutes, eat at ten o'clock, one dish and one soup, because only two meals are eaten every day, the younger children's department eats porridge at eleven o'clock, which is specially provided for the children's department; from 1:30 to 4:30, the youth department goes to the mountain to fight guerrillas, and the children's department begins technical learning, technical learning; including singing, drama, live reporting, dance lectures; then transfer to the mountain to fight guerrillas or technical learning, dinner at five o'clock, go out to perform in the evening or do the work that has not been completed during the day, and sleep at ten o'clock.</p>
<p>The propaganda methods of the whole troupe are divided into films, dramas, singing, speeches, dances, live reports, comics, slogans, wall newspapers, photo exhibitions, and military-civilian conferences. All these techniques adopt the small teacher system, and their own people train their own people. The whole troupe of more than 50 people includes all kinds of people, and the film is made with hand lanterns, and the materials for singing, live reporting and dancing are either compiled by themselves or based on the materials published in newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>During the carnival held every Sunday, the group can eat some sweets, and self-criticism must be held in this meeting. Every child wears a gray uniform, like a team of young soldiers, because life is indeed militarized. When Guilin was bombed, we worked in the caves.</p>
<h3>The Most Cruel Weapon in Modern Warfare: Poison Gas</h3>
<p>Eliminating the enemy's combat capability, an invisible killer that is difficult to defend against.</p>
<p>As the Second World War unfolds, the most deadly weapon known to people—poison gas—will once again unleash its power, posing an immense threat and causing great suffering to people, especially soldiers. This can be stated with certainty. Why is poison gas so deadly and terrifying? Because other weapons kill in a visible way, and there are methods to prevent and defend against them. However, poison gas kills invisibly and is almost impossible to defend against. Other weapons can instantly kill vast numbers of people, but once buried, the matter is over. Poison gas, however, attacks the most tender and unprotected parts of the human body, such as the lungs, eyes, nose, throat, and skin. Valiant soldiers, once poisoned, become completely helpless. Some suffer for minutes or hours, while others endure terrible injuries that require long-term medical treatment to heal. Soldiers in this living-dead state not only lose their combat effectiveness but also cause their commanders to expend great effort and be greatly burdened, as the medical care and supplies for wounded soldiers are always the most difficult problems during combat!</p>
<p>During the last World War, a total of twenty-two types of poison gas were used, with sixteen types that could be mixed. However, only a few were truly effective, easy to mass-produce, and suitable for large-scale deployment. Although chemists have devoted their efforts to inventing new poisonous gases, if poison gas is used in this or future wars, it will likely be the same types that were used last time and proven to be effective. According to their properties, they can be categorized as follows:</p>
<p>1. Asphyxiant gases; 2. Lacrimatory gases; 3. Sternutatory gases; 4. Vesicant gases. However, many type A gases also have the effects of type B or type C gases, so their categorization is sometimes difficult to distinguish clearly.</p>
<p>Asphyxiant Gases</p>
<p>This is a type of gas that causes death. It can invade the lungs, causing congestion and respiratory obstruction. Chlorine gas, first used by Germany in 1915, is the most famous of these gases. Later, other deadly gases were invented, and it was no longer used as frequently. However, chlorine gas remains an important raw material for manufacturing other poisonous gases. For example, Phosgene is made from chlorine and carbon monoxide.</p>
<p>Lacrimatory Gases</p>
<p>These gases have a very strong tear-inducing effect but do not contain toxic components. Therefore, using this type of gas against undefended troops is an excellent strategy. Moreover, a small amount is sufficient to cause widespread disruption, making it a very economical and cost-effective gas.</p>
<p>Sternutatory Gases</p>
<p>The use of these gases forces the opponent to sneeze and vomit repeatedly, forcing them to remove their gas masks, after which other poisonous gases are released to inflict serious or fatal damage. Therefore, this type of gas is like a vanguard that removes obstacles, and its use is the precursor to a true poison gas attack.</p>
<p>Vesicant Gases</p>
<p>There are two types: Mustard gas and Lewisite. The former has enjoyed the reputation of the "king of poisonous gases" since it was first used at the end of the Great War, while the latter, although someone proposed naming it "death fog" and using aircraft to deploy it, has not been put into practice. Mustard gas is made from very common daily chemical raw materials such as alcohol, sulfur, and chlorine gas. It is odorless, and even a small amount has a great effect. It can remain on the ground and in low-lying areas for several days. People who are poisoned do not initially feel any discomfort, but in reality, they have suffered deep and painful injuries. Because this gas has extremely potent vesicant properties, whether it is a gas or a liquid, it can penetrate clothing and cause the skin to blister, swell, sting, and be extremely painful. It is also very difficult to treat, and even minor injuries take weeks to heal. Severe cases can take months. Mustard gas not only burns the human body and harms livestock but can also corrode machinery, making it unusable. Its destructive power is truly great and terrible. Mustard gas does not immediately affect the eyes and throat, but after a few hours, the poisoned person can become completely blind, and it may take several weeks to recover. Releasing a small amount of mustard gas is naturally not easy to detect, but unknowingly, this small amount already has the aforementioned destructive power and subsequent latent effects. Therefore, mustard gas is the most effective of all poisonous gases in destroying the morale of the enemy, so it is no wonder that the world calls it the "king of poisonous gases."</p>
<p>Strange News</p>
<h3>The Man-Eating Tree of Africa</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>In the second year of the Republic, there was a news report about the man-eating tree of Africa. I will write it down below, as far as my memory allows:</p>
<p>Japanese people living in Africa always organize a group to take walks or play in the lush forests of Africa every summer to get fresh air and enjoy themselves. One summer, the Japanese people living in Africa, as usual, formed a group and went on a tour. When they set off, they counted the number of people, brought hunting dogs and bread, and proceeded to their destination. When they arrived at a forest with green grass and lush trees, they sang, walked, and rested. However, when they returned and counted the number of people, one person was missing. Although they searched everywhere, they couldn't find him. In the summer of the twelfth year of the Republic, a group of Japanese people went to the same place to tour. As they were sitting on the ground resting, a hunting dog, because it was thirsty and wanted to find some water to quench its thirst, happened to see some water on a huge leaf of a tree. So, it ran up and licked it with its tongue. Immediately, the leaf stirred and wrapped the hunting dog inside. In a moment, the leaf unfolded, and the hunting dog was gone. Then the group of Japanese people sitting on the ground realized that the Japanese person who had disappeared several years ago had been eaten by that huge leaf!</p>
<h3>All-Out Brawl at the World PEN Congress</h3>
<p>— Guanqing</p>
<p>This year's World PEN Congress was held in London. During the meeting, a Belgian representative angered an Italian representative, resulting in an all-out brawl. The Italian representative, Mr. Mannatt, sarcastically said from the Italian perspective: "Italy not only welcomes Fascist writers but also sincerely welcomes those who sympathize with the Fascist system but cannot actively ally with it." The Belgian representative, Mr. Pirade, became enraged upon hearing these words and jumped up, saying: "Yes, we all know that Italy is a land of lambs, and everywhere else in the world except Italy is full of wolves." Mr. Pirade also cited the example of the famous Italian philosopher and writer Croce, saying how the Fascist police searched his house and confiscated his works. Mannatt immediately jumped onto the podium and punched him repeatedly. Finally, the president of the PEN Congress used his highest authority to suppress and resolve the situation, and this scene of a literary brawl came to an end.</p>
<p>After the start of the war, French troops crossed from French territory into German territory. The direction is indicated by the arrow in the picture. This area is the Saar River region, the no-man's-land between the Maginot and Siegfried Lines, which is twenty-five miles wide.</p>
