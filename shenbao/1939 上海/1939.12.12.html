<h3>糾正米市</h3>
<p>上海公共租界工部局與法租界工部局，隔昨會銜出示曉諭，對於界內米糧之囤積投機壟斷者，予以嚴厲警告，謂將不予保護，或驅逐出境、充公其存貨；並希望界內居民，與工部局相合作，凡知此項情事者，據實報告，以憑懲處。溯自上海若干喪心病狂之徒，以米糧爲投機目標，致使米價在漲之後，數百萬居民之生活，直接遭受壓迫，兩租界之安寗秩序，間接蒙其影響；本報自兩星期以來，一再痛切申論；嘗謂「五百萬居民之生活問題，付之投機奸商之手；而放任投機，不加制裁，此則今日之上海而外，古今中外無其偶；」「上海非不組織井然，機關森然，然以市面與民生論之，則在無政府狀態之中；」故主張發動「各組織，各機關之權威，制裁奸商；」在居民福利與界內治安之前提之下，以種種可能之方法，作直接間接之壓迫。」「調查存米數量，與每日到埠數量，及其來價之外，幷應調查其囤積押款操縱等情形，調查其經營之主名；罪惡在所必懲，於法未必能懲者，圭少頻頻拘訉之，更於其營業居住生活有關之種種，予以不方便；發表之，不留其體面」；並於治本之道，則嘗主張疎通來源，集中買賣，定購洋米。今者，兩租界當局毅然採行嚴厲之制裁方法，有如隔昨之所公告；本報初未以此爲文字有靈，輿論奏效；然租界當局近頃凡百政績之中，實以此舉爲最能適應迫切之需要，造福居民，穩定治安，抑亦最見俯察輿情，大快人心者也。</p>
<p>部局公告，除遍張通衢而外，並刋昨日報端；與公告平行者，尙有米業發表限價，據聞秉承租界當局之意旨，限最高白粳爲每石四十五元，秈米每石三十八元。此項限價，非公告所明示，而百姓竊議，皆謂太高。蓋因一經限價，在米商心目中幾以此爲米糧之最低價；試觀歷次限價之結果，往往將次米之價逐漸遞升至限價。靑腰白臍糠稗礫屑之米質，逼迫食用者不得不求較好完整之米粒，以便煮食，免多耗蝕；於是米商又可上下其手，乘機勒索，如要好米，應出何價，此其手段之毒辣，明係無形中之漲價，而爲實質上之破壞，食戶固惟有以無可如何之隱痛，當局亦必苦於「事出有因，查無實據」，而以無可如何了之。故亦有論者，謂上海民食，如果仍採限價辦法，何不寬限於舊限價新破之後，又何不限於投機囤積方於四十元以內逐日躍進之際，而必待米價高漲至此，始加限制；此於囤戶仍不失其獲利之機會，徒苦、一般小民耳。遂有謂此必米商以價高難限制爲理由，又必以「倒拔蛇」不易實行，從中阻撓相嘗試。不但如此而已，限價僅爲治標，僅可暫遏漲風；設無管理之制，以繩其後，則前車匪遙，破壞寗豈難事；届時而果三次限制，米價已不知高至如何地步。何况米商暗中破壞，弊竇百出，防不勝防，制不勝制。凡此云云，居民於稱頌租界當局此次毅然措施之餘，猶不勝其憂疑者也。</p>
<p>民食乃無政中之要政，亦社會之絕大問題也。若期以一紙告示而本末兼治，憂疑盡釋者，原屬逾分之希望；若此事而能如此簡單解決，則不成爲要政，不成爲大問題，抑此項公告亦必不待隔昨矣。要知租界內之組織與機關，雖規模宏備，然關於民食者，夙無專責之機構，亦無儲備之人力財力以及其他必要之物力。而今茲之能嚴厲措施者，固因事實上之迫切需要，亦因若干客觀條件之容許若此嚴厲也。蓋界內存貨充盈，足敷數月消耗，不虞奸商遽以罷運爲要挾，此其一。產米之區，新穀登塲，非比根本靑黃不接之頃，此其二。各地米價亦相當之高，尤使農家樂於此際脫手，此其三。貨運不暢，旣不虞存米外流，且米價已貴亦不利於外流，此其四。米珠薪桂，怨聲載道，蔚爲租界當局最有力量之後勁，及此而發動懲儆，有非奸商所敢舞文弄法以相要挾抗違者，此其五。惟此五者，可信於告示之適應環境，可信於告示之必不終等具文。</p>
<p>此次之一紙告示，必有效騐，顧未極能事也。竊意猶須有以繼告示之後者：一應其體獎勵告發，使囤積投機之輩，不敢肆惡。二應澈查界內大戶囤積，擇尤徵發或沒收。三應逐漸採行管理辦法，按日調查到源，集中市塲，公開評價，分配於各米店，苟有餘糧，則出以公儲之一法。四應亟事疎通來源，另籌接濟之方。五應責成備房，運用其公訴之特權，就有危害公衆生存之虞者，比引刑章，懲一儆百，六應發動幹練廉介之探員，並特約若干工商界正當人士，以種種方法，查考有無奸商，照最高之限價而售較次之米，或以較好之米售較高之價；若有其事，務予嚴懲，七應督促堆棧，催提存米。八應督促金融界，催償米糧棧單之押款，吾則俱予懲戒。總之，必須以劍及屨及之精神，臻雷厲風行之法治。必須壓迫奸商，不作居奇取巧之謀，不作觀望待機之想；若使此輩鑒於租界當局之決心，官民熱烈之合作，但求微利可圖，相率脫手以保正常之本息，則可信市價降至限價之下，固極有其可能者也。</p>
<h3>英法封鎖德貿易　蘇聯提出强硬抗議　認爲有捐中立國之權利　日艦載德軍火展期起椗</h3>
<p>莫斯科　英國政府於十一月二十八日公佈封鎖德國出口貨物命令、其中聲明、英政府禁止一切貨物、從德國海港及德產貨物從中立海港由海道運往他國、裝載上述貨物之船舶、必須駛入英法兩國海港、由英法將所有貨物沒收或强迫出售、中立國船隻凡由直通德國之國家之海港運貨出口者、必須開往英法兩國海港、俾受檢查、關於此令、蘇聯政府頃於十二月十日將節略一件、致送英國駐蘇大使、對英國上述各辦法、提出抗議、認爲違犯中立國權利、節略中首先追述蘇聯政府曾於十月二十五日聲明不同意英國取締戰爭違禁品之辦法、因其違犯國際公法、擾害海上貿易、此次英政府十一月二十八日封鎖德國出口貨之命令、更使中立國之利益、受有損害、英國進行經濟戰之方法、在國際關係歷史上可謂空前、而與國際法之規定、完全相反、按照該法、中立國從交戰國輸入某種貨品、以充自用時、不論貨品係何國製造、任何人均不得加以禁止、英國禁止德貨出口轉運之舉、亦屬違犯國際法、最後、蘇聯政府認英國要求凡由直通德國之各國海港開出之船舶、一律必須開往英法海港受檢查、不問所載貨係何國製造一舉、尤屬武斷專橫舉動、因此、蘇聯茲對英國上述各辦法、提出抗議、而於蘇聯國有船舶被迫開往英法海港、因而受有損失、或蘇聯對外貿易、因英國實施十一月二十八日命令、而受有損失之時、保留要求賠償之權利、（十日塔斯電）</p>

<p>敎育消息</p>
<h3>本屆大學　統一招生考試槪况（二）　敎部黃龍先科長之槪述</h3>
<p>（二）招考的院校</p>
<p>本年統考除國立各院校全部列入招生外、代招者尚有省立大學二校、共計二十八單位、七十七學院、三百零一學系（包括三專修科）事務之繁複、於此可以想見、本年尚有兩特點、即（一）國立各大學及獨立學院全部列入招生範圍、去年上海各院校因環境關係、均自行招生、而其由上海各校院代招後方國立各校院新生、經錄取後、分發後方各大　肄業、今年上海情形雖亦感覺困雖、但仍組織招生委員會進行招考事宜、這一點是値得幸慰的、不過滬上究竟環境特殊、在內地投考的學生、仍不得以上海各校爲志願學校、（二）省立大學今年亦全部加入統考、去年雖亦將廣西及重慶大學列入、而本年則遠在豫西交通不便的河南大學、亦已加入、除省立各獨立學院外、公立各校院已完全加入、從這兩點看來、可見統考的效力、已普遍施之於公立校院、至統考所包括的院系、因校數增加、數量自亦隨之漸多、不過本年所列院系、專修科是除外的、原因是專修科本爲專科性質、且如藝術等類的專修科、考試科目固有不同、錄取標準、亦靴與其他院系合而爲一、體育專修科雖亦情形相似、但中大與國師所設的童子軍與體育專修科及重大的體育專修科、因省時及省事起見、今年仍然列入、可是錄取的標準是與其他各院系不同的、</p>
<p>（三）考試的科目</p>
<p>考試的科目是考試的本質問題、考生程度如何、考試是否有價値、考試科目關係最大、科目太少、看不出學生程度的好壞、科目太多、學生又不勝其負擔、且亦無此必要、統考的科目、無疑的是以中學科目爲基礎的、但過去各校自行招生、所老科目、多寡至不一致因此、入學程度亦極參差不齊、統考的科目是經過長久而縝密的考慮才訂定的、大致分爲兩項、一爲筆試、一爲口試、口試只投考師範學院者用之、筆試分三組、第一組爲文·法•商學院各學系、師範學院敎育·公民訓育·體育•國文·英語·史地·家政等學系·及工學院之鐵道管理系、第二組爲工學院各系、理學院數學·物理•化學•天文•氣象•土木等系、及師範學院之數學·理化等系、第三組爲醫學院，農學院各系、理化院生物·地理·地質等學系、及師範學院之博物系、三組的必試科目、均爲七鬥、有四門是完全相同的、即公民、國文•英文（投考同濟及中山大學醫學院者考試德文）及本國史地、數學也是三組都有、、可是難易深淺不同、第一組數學內包括代數、平面幾何及三角、第二組數學甲包括高　代數、解析幾何及三角、第三組數學乙包括高等代數、平面幾何及三角、三組不同之其他二必試科目、第一組爲外國史地•及物理•化學•生物選考一門、第二組爲物理及化學、第三組爲生物（投考地理系者改試外國史地）及物理化學選考一門、又投考體育系科者、尚須加試術科課目、此外、考試科目與考生志願有重要關係、如以第二組爲第一志願而以第三組爲第二第三志願者、須加試生物或外國史地、兼以同濟或中山大學醫學院爲志願者、須加考德文、以上列二校院爲第一志願而以他校爲第二或第三志願者、須加考英文、但學生的志願、須受組別的限制、以第一組院系爲第一志願者、只能選擇本組之其他院系爲第二第三志願、以第二組院系爲第二志願者得以本組及第三組之院系爲其他志願、但不得以第一組各系爲其他志願、以第三組院系爲第一志願者只能選擇本組其他院系爲其他志願、但不得以第一或第二組各系爲其他志願、惟地理系亦得以第一組院系爲其他志願、</p>
<p>（四）試題的頒發</p>
<p>試題的問題、要算是考試極重要的事情了、今年統考最大的成功、就是統一試題已經辦到、本來在這非常時期、交通如此困難、而統一的試題居然能於考期前圓滿的送達各考區、眞是一件最令人滿意的事、統考的試題是以極周密的方法從好幾套題目內選擇出來的、雖然不免有難易不一的地方、但是爲提高學生程度起見、未可加以厚非、何况從學理方面來講試題是應該有難有易呢、命題的標凖、事先曾由敎育部加以規定、就是（一）命題的範關及程度浪以高中課程標準爲限、命題的內容、應以審定之適用敎科書爲依據、（二）各科試題數目、應以一般考生能於規定時數內完卷者爲準（國文·數學·英文或德文各三小時、其餘各科各二小時）、試題應規定由學生全作、不得採用任擇或選作辦法、但各題次序得由學生變動、（三）國文試作文一篇、（文言語體均可）文言語體互譯各　篇、（四）英文試作文一篇及英譯漢漢譯英各　篇、（德文仿此）、（五）各科命題、不宜空泛或偏重記憶、（六）物理化學生物試題中須各有一題考試實騐之程序、這樣的規定、可算是合理的了、試題擬定後、由敎育部覆核密交統一招生委員會主席嚴密付印、並由敎育部部長次長親臨監視、印就後由敎育部派專員妥送各招生區親交各該區主席委員嚴密印就封存備用、手續的周密、可以想見、今年監送試題因交通及時問的關係、分五路出發、（一）成都•南鄭•鎭平·蘭州四區、（二）貴陽·辰谿二區、（三）昆明·上海二區、（四）桂林·曲江·泰和·永康·延平五區、（五）恩施區、爲求迅速計、大多數均乘飛機出發、送題專員最後達到之區並須負監視責任、敎部對於此事的重視、可見一般、又各區爲頃防考試時遇有空襲或試題洩露起見、得自行預擬各科試題一份、以備發生意外時的應用、</p>

<h3>糧食　當局取締操縱　米糧囤戶稍歛迹　行情下降一二元不等　　洋米價到萬八千餘包</h3>
<p>米　價自一路暴漲後、平民生計痛苦已極、茲者自租界嚴厲取締投機操縱豆米業公會實施嚴厲限價後、一般囤戶及專事投機者、頓見無形絕跡、米價立告平穩、昨雖內地來源仍祇到蘇嘉路一帶之貨六七車、然以操縱無術、業外之人匿跡、僅有一般店舖實胃、稍事添購耳、但銷路旣鮮、故非惟不能再昂、而一般囤戶旣失憑籍、反羣相拋出、現貨回籠貨頓見充斥於市、供過於求、不得不甩價競售、市面即難立足、節節下游、直迄收市、若粳尖及陰變元等行情雖較前市已落一二元不等、常粳已依限價爲四十五元、餘外各粳悉已進限在四十元左右焉、而全市成交猶甚寥寥、觀乎大局趨勢、人心已頽、或有續步下瀉之可能云、</p>
<p>客　秈到存兩稀、市上交易均屬零多躉少、但市面則因受粳米轉跌影響、故人心亦軟、昨市江北尖售價爲三十七元半至三十七元、蕪湖尖售價爲三十七元三角至三十六元八角較前市跌去六七角、</p>
<p>洋　米定價仍高、故行商暫無意續訂、路貨交易因之亦漸轉寂、現貨雖有浮戶求脫、但市面跌風較緩、統市成交西貢一號米共一千餘包、價爲三十八元至三十七元半、比之前市略小五六角、查到貨方面、續有一萬八千包抵埠、</p>
<h3>來源被阻　小麥迭見新價　午後高至十四元　米貴致粉價亦漲</h3>
<p>麥　前昨來源、依然廖落、因車運到貨均被阻碍、不准直接運入租界、致市塲供源益稀、執貨者因粉市廠盤又高、售價更爲望好、即有少數應酬者、其價均非十四元不售、上午市塲成交崑山麥　三車、價十三元七角、午後愈俏、廠家亦放價收買、吃盤至十四元新高價、計由福新辦去五千包、阜豐辦去八千包、</p>
<p>麪　粉廠盤昨又升一角、二號粉批價已改爲八元四角、蓋緣近來實銷頗有起色、皆受米價昂貴影響、平民之搭食麪粉者漸衆、若以四十五元之米價而論、則粉價尚屬便宜、更兼小麥原料一再飛騰、故人心無不向上、回籠貨益見俏利、綠砲車棧單開至八元八九角、其漲風亦可見一斑矣、統市成交約有四萬包、查日廠粉鳳凰牌十二月份交易續見閙熱、因被一般投機者所側重、上午初開八元三角、旋即回至二角四五分、聞一月份亦有開出、價爲八元六角五分云、</p>
<h3>金融　華商不斷出售外滙</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、情况平庸、靜中略形鬆動、中途雖港電暨紗花帮塞出、但被匯豐吃進及一部份華商跟扒所抵銷、故結果所鬆無幾、至當日經過、晨開英稍帶軟、美則告平、開後市况平淡、祇華行略有售出、但亦無何變動、及至十一時許、香港突來電塞、同時紗花帮亦稍跟賣、故遂鬆達四辦士五三一二五、及七元四三七五、其中因匯豐吃進不少、故一部份華商遂稍扒進遠月、致市象略形回平、以四辦士半及七元三四三七五收盤、午後狀態更形沉寂、英金毫無變動、而美匯因華商續扒入遠月、會稍帶軟、惟結果仍告四辦士半及七元三四三七五收盤、（合英美匯兌爲三元九角一分六釐二）、較上週末英鬆〇一五六二五、美硬　六　五、至期貨趨勢、則與現貨相埒、</p>
<p>港方塞出匯豐進</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、及美銀價均無電訊、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美·對滬·對法俱平、美對英未更、對滬降五分、對法小六二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價英金四辦士四六八七五、美匯七元二八一二五、較之週六、英軟〇一五六二五、美則無榮辱、開後狀况呆定、交易亦鮮聞做開、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無升降、此後華行稍來吐予外行現貨美匯七元三一二五、爲狀仍告穩靜、如是者直至十一時許、港電忽來吐出、且紗花帮多頭亦來出籠、雖其時匯豐尚有納胃、但亦乘機扳價、故市面遂形鬆動、計港電售予匯豐有利等外行現貨英金四辦士半與五一五六二五、及現貨美匯七元三七五與四三七五、同時紗花帮亦吐予大通某行等本月份美匯七元三四三七五與四〇六　五、後現貨英金買方曾還過四辦士五三一二五、午刻賣風已息、且有一部份華商鑒匯豐吃進、遂稍來跟扒、致市象頓稍回平、計投機商扒進有利正月份美匯爲七元二五、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士半、美滙七元三四三七五、比晨開英回鬆〇三一二五、美硬〇六二五、</p>
<p>投機稍結一月期</p>
<p>後市情况父告沉悶、交易亦極淸淡、初因華商復來稍扒遠月、致其時美匯曾略形軟化、惟英金則呆定於四辦士半、計華商扒入外行正月份美匯七元一八七五、時現貨價爲七元三一二五、入後因外行頗肯供塞、故市象不久即見回平、迄至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英余四辦士半、美匯七元三四三七五、本月份英金四辦士四八四三七五、美匯七元三一二五、正月份英金四辦士四六八七五、美匯七元二一八七五、結果比上週末現期英均微鬆〇一五六二五、美俱略硬〇六二五、</p>
<p>香港美鬆英不動</p>
<p>香港十一日電、今晨匯市開盤平穩、各匯均無榮辱、十一時三十分市面呆滯、行情不動、午收美匯現貨鬆〇六二五、爲二十四元三七五、申匯現貨降五元、爲三百二十七元、下午二時三十分開盤平穩不動、二時五十分申匯現貨回升四元、爲三百三十一元、</p>
<p>天津滙價昨猛長</p>
<p>天津十一日電、今晨匯市開盤由硬趨堅、英匯現貨鬆一二五爲四便士一八七五美匯現貨猛長三一二五、爲六元八七五、申匯降三元、爲一百零八元、「聯鈔」暗盤回賤二角半、仍爲九十三元、</p>
<h3>金市動盪不定　四千二百元大關出而復入</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市祝、變動稍形擴大、惟結果尚平、大致先漲繼跌而後盤旋、四千二百元大關穿出後、重又鑽入、論當日過程、晨開告平、嗣因港帮本其一貫作風、首來猛扒、證券帮亦有搜入、雖投機商曾有塞出、但一時頭寸仍難相敵、開後未及半小時已昂達四千二百十三元高峯、惟好景不常、外匯倐然告硬、人心一挫、金號證券帮等競相拋賣、加以港帮已束手停進、市象不支、暴落四五十元、而某錢兌業代本帮傾向出籠、降達四千一百四十元低盤、旋以外匯稍回、金號獲利復進、午收回達四千一百六十八元、午後因美滙略軟、港帮重扒、余號及證券帮亦有撈進、又漲達四千二百元邊境、入後另一錢兌業趁高吐售回小至四千一百八十四元收盤、較上週六午收尚軋漲四元、若比上日塲外則反小十餘兀、全天交易約在三千兩之上、銀樓飾金先跌後回、終則未更、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤軋漲四元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開局勢尚靜、價因上日塲外本已做高、首由銀樓帮售予錢兌業十兩、爲四千一百九十元、較週六正式價則軋漲十元、少頃證券帮前來收買、同時港帮亦委某金號撈進、不久即衝出四千二百元關外、證券帮進錢兌業三十兩、爲四千二百〇五元、其時某金號代投機商力塞百餘兩、曾回小至四千一百九十五元、嗣以金號及某錢兌業復代港帮猛扒、且某金號已中止塞出、苒步漲十八元、銀樓帮吐予錢兌業金號共五十兩、爲四千二百十三元、旋以外匯報硬、人心頓挫、港帮停止扒吸、加以某金號復代投機商猛售、且證券帮及錢兌業等亦來復出、未及半小時價已暴落四十八元、錢兌業互做二十兩、爲四千一百六十五元、其時港帮續來吸進二百兩光景、但賣方仍未肯示弱、故一度盤旋於四千一百六七十元之間、迨至十一時一刻、聞匯市續鬆、初代港帮扒入之某金號所跟風浮多、頓來斬結、同時某錢兌業亦代多方出籠二百餘兩、市勢復告不支、續小二十餘元、某錢兌業出某金號及同業共百數十兩、均爲四千一百四十元、後因某金號及散戶等繼續復進、某銀號亦趁低搜人、且匯市已止鬆稍平、故一霎那即回起三十二元、錢兌業進金號四十兩、爲四千一百七十二元、將近收盤時、銀樓帮吐出數十兩、遂撳低四元、爲四千一百六十八元作午收價、午後初開疲落三元、證券帮出金號十兩、爲四千一百六十五元、嗣因某錢兌業重代港帮扒進、同時美匯略形帶軟、且金號及證券帮亦有納胃、故遂漲起三十三元、金號進銀樓帮二十兩、爲四千一百九十八元、後因另一錢兌業突來猛塞、且港帮吃胃已足、再以外匯回平、遂即回落二十八元、現金號售予證券帮二十兩、爲四千一百七十元、時某金號復來撈入、銀樓帮亦有復進、又高十七元、銀樓帮進錢兌業三十兩、爲四千一百八十七元、入後散戶賣出、遂小八元、錢兌業售予金號三十兩、爲四千一百八十元、繼而錢兌業進證券帮二十兩、爲四千一百八十四元作晚收價、結果較週六軋漲四元、若比上日塲外則回小十餘元、全天七十三元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高十元、收進約减小二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金先跌後回</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百二十五元、迨至十一時三刻掛小五元、下午傍晚四時突回起五元、結果大同行仍懸四百二十五元、新同行與上同相、收進約均减小十五元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣微鬆　美余票十三元五角四</h3>
<p>昨日外幣、英美金鎊供給微殷、趨勢鬆動、金票供給暢爽、市價軟弱、美票上午爲十三元五角七分、下午需要呆滯、市價更鬆、晚市爲十三元五角四分、港票與法郞供給較股、市况稍弱、新荷票俱乏需要、市價下降、加票緊隨美票鬆　而下游、日票供給較盛、晚市爲一元二角四分三厘、朝鮮票供給不暢、晚市爲一元一角三分三厘、昨日市價、英美金鎊各降五角、英金票降二角五分、美金票降一角三分、港票降五厘、法郞降二區、新加坡荷蘭票俱降一角、安南票降　分、坎蔡降二角、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>證券　橡皮股票　氣象蓬勃　內債起伏仍小</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、交易依然淸淡、趨勢之失去其彈力性、無彈力性者、即無投機之可言、故咸趨於通貨買賣、惟昨有在香港將召集金融會議之說、此種情形、關係於烚赤及公債者至爲鉅大、故公債前途、不久將來、必尚有一番熱鬧也、昨日上下午交易、以下午略多、買賣雙方、均少興趣、故結果仍祗五分上落、成交數目約計三四十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交亞洲銀行股一百股、價爲二十元正、</p>
<p>衆業公所、股市報告、實業股趨勢穩健、而冷落已久之橡皮股實有熱烈演出、蓬勃至於極點、開盤市况即堅、入後成交激增、價格步高、直至終了、巳有數十萬較廉之股宣告轉手、此時實業股幾乎全被忽視、由於橡皮股本身價値、過去之被估低、昨日激急動態、及時表露、原不足異、惟全日大批交易中、甚多不加區別之購進、蓋橡皮股各有其優劣之點、價得審辨、固不應一視同仁也、茲將昨日成交價格開收盤比較列下、</p>

<h3>紗花　獲利出籠　紗價回挫</h3>
<p>連漲三日之紗市、昨則已引起獲利者乘機出籠而復下挫、同時實銷亦不及上日之旺、因此人心帶平惟海外棉市依然前進、一部份心思仍屬傾向拋進、市態遂呈徘徊之狀、未能積極上騰、就原料而論、市面恐無大跌風也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開承上日一鼓熱烈之人氣續進、二十支雙馬曾到七百四十二元、比上日漲起十五元、詎料價目一高、獲利者乘勢出檔、市價又迅速回挫、直跌至七百二十六元、同時客銷亦不旺、情况仍弱、迨至收盤仍平常、查半日間成交統計一千五百五十七包、行情二十支雙馬升一元、天女跌一元、雙地球跌二元、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>

<h3>棉市活躍　成交以同行居多</h3>
<p>本棉交易、尚稱不弱、仍以同行交易居多數、廠方需要未曾大量發展、僅申新工廠稍有採辦點綴而已、目前有一部份心理持觀望態度、故趨勢遂呈堅挺之象、然海外棉市一味上升、情况仍屬良好、兼之來源有限、棉市基礎甚昂、因看好者尚小乏人、收羅不絕、不過所漲殊巨、獲利者稍有吐出、與紗市同一情形也、故昨日之售價與上日不相上下、蘇北來源、通花二千五百四十八包、常陰沙一百八十二包、北沙來二千七百五十包、成交情形列左、</p>

<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市日來殊見活躍、海外各方深懼尚餘之出口津貼四十磅音、即將取消、因之彼等交易異常踴躍、棉價因而被其拉起、同時同業交易甚夥、空頭抵補甚烈、結果收盤價格較之上日又漲十餘磅音、印度棉市較爲靜寂、市價連同預測漲起三羅比，埃及棉市殊爲挺秀、昨日竟漲起一百餘磅音、利物浦停市、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、各方深悉尚餘之出口津貼四十磅音即將取消、但因目前售價甚高、不願訂購、擬暫抱覜望、交易異常靜寂、但一般預料美棉交易、將於最近期內、仍將有活躍之可能也、兹將昨日棉市以美匯七元三一二五折合送廠價如下、</p>

<h3>雜糧　黃豆漲力堅强　芝蔴市仍平定</h3>
<p>黃豆　昨日黃豆市况、自上週末傳車輛被阻影響、來源不繼、人心突受激變、各豆行市邁步騰漲、市塲中交易祗有日商運來之貨、統計成交九江遲豆一千餘包、便爲十九元五角至二十元、蕪湖豆五六百包、價爲十八元三角、丁家州豆二百包、價爲十九元、崇明沙黃一百五十餘包、價爲十九元三角至十九元、銷塲高品仍由港帮同津、其他本街居多、</p>
<p>芝蔴　昨日市仍定局、洋莊前曾有四十五元開過一批外、近日無交易、昨祗本街辦去明光蔴及管店雪蔴三百餘包云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　府紅棗呌漲</h3>
<p>雜路紅棗、前以到貨較多、客貨開價步軟、高府紅最小曾到二十四五元、昨叫二十七元、普通二十元左右、長紅棗開二十元半、各方去胃尚屬活動、蓋市價較宜、頗合客需也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　春夏貨坯布　成交大批　市盤繼續上騰</h3>
<p>布　市以香港南洋需印旺盛、本街批發號及要染廠吸納大批春夏貨坯布、囤戶亦繼續活躍、致市盤有繼續增高之勢、白貨粗布·細布·細斜漲（每疋）一角至三角、漂染布每疋漲二三角、坯布漲勢更銳、細色丁坯布由上月底三十七元左右、升至現市四十三四元、本街成交各種坯布粗細布斜紋·府綢六百餘件、南洋帮香港帮辦細布·粗布·細斜•印花漂白各布一萬數千疋、浙皖帮辦細布粗布二百餘包、</p>
<p>東　布晨漲午疲、十一磅龍　細布市塲開盤、高峯做出每疋廿一元三角半、至午爲廿一元二角、後市因聞外滙放長、掮客拋售、一度降至廿元零八角、旋以洋行收現、辦龍頭一百數十包、抬價收盤爲廿一元、結果較上週回跌一角半、但一月期貨則頗堅挺、行方索價須廿三元之說、故同業人心依舊隱宅、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球又漲六元　門售每担四元二</h3>
<p>煤球行情、本月中因外匯關係、一週內同業拆價、連漲數盤、昨日（十一日）先令雖尚平穩、但煤球售盤因洋輪水脚增加、每噸又漲六元、計開義泰興·南洋·國華煤球、每噸七十八元、送到外加車力兩元、門莊零售、每担四元二角云）</p>
<h3>糖市　荷糖續緊</h3>
<p>昨荷糖續見緊秀、公會劃盤、與貨二四粗白本棧五十七元、外棧新貨五十八元至五十八元半、老貨五十七元至五十七元八角、轉口貨升至四十九元、荷赤升元許、WA嘜四十三元半、MP嘜四十四元、太古車白上落無幾、東棧B嘜五十六元、西棧五十六元半、CW嘜五十六元二角、CX嘜五十五元九角、DY嘜五十五元半、東棧五十五元、HX嘜五十四元半、H嘜車赤四十二元半、本綿白振記一號五十七元、一號冰六十七元、晶明冰六十八元、俱升半元、國產靑赤糖號盤仍挺、大都堅守少出、呌價略增、</p>
<h3>五金　盤元廠需漸動</h3>
<p>盤元（本釘原料）銷塲、素以本街製釘廠爲最廣、其他客帮當推津烟靑數帮爲最殷、近因本街製釘廠巳恢復工作、昨購去有百餘噸之譜、此外津靑烟諸客帮、亦搜去五六—噸光景、故人心堅强、喊價回好一二元、</p>

<p>大華大戲院開幕特刋</p>
<h3>歡迎嘉賓</h3>
<p>新陳代謝，是天演的公例。在科學上，年有新的重要發明，替代了陳舊的渣滓。大都會的新建築，也就根據上述的理由，不斷地建設起來，新的淘汰了舊的。</p>
<p>在上海，人口的密度集到頂點的現在，需要一座最科學化的新型影院，是不可否認的事實。遠東影院公司就担負起這時代需要的責任，把這座在電影史上有相當功蹟的夏令配克，改造成站在時代最前線的影院。</p>
<p>眼睛是最公正的證人，嘴吧是最忠實的報人；謹在歡迎嘉賓之餘，恭請每位嘉賓的眼睛，作一番詳盡巡禮，每位嘉賓的嘴吧，作一番客觀的報道。</p>
<p>影院最重要的問題是「安全第一」，次之為「便利」與「舒適」。敝院的太平門設備。也許是握着全滬最高的紀錄，樓下有三扇太平門通白克路，四扇通靜安寺路；樓上有三扇通靜安寺路，一扇通白克路，總數是十一扇太平門，調劑擁擠的觀衆是非常充分與安全。</p>
<p>公共汽車與電車的停車站，近在咫尺。停靠自備汽車的四大幹路，靜安寺路斜橋衖同孚路與白克路，够得上「便利」二字的意義。至於「舒適」方面，似乎不必多費筆墨，讓嘉賓下一個正的批判。</p>
<p>在建築工程進展與本刋的編纂中，荷蒙各方面直接或間接給予甚大的助力，這裏敬以十二萬分的誠意，向各方申述肫摯的謝忱。而今天惠然肯來的嘉賓。這裏也好以十二萬分的誠意，向來賓歡迎及道謝！</p>
<h3>聲光座　簇新的姿態　最新的設備</h3>
<p>戲院的機構，需要健全的組織，是無疑的事實，所謂「天時」「地利」「人和」三者，確是必要的條件，除了這天地人三才外，聲光座三美，也有着相輔並行的連鎖關係。一家新戲院的創辦，美麗的外衣，固然値得注意，可是它的心臟—聲光座，也要加倍的重視。大華大戲院今天開幕，對於上述三者，雖不敢自詡是盡善盡美，至少是跟着時代前進，採取最時代化的最新設備，拿事實來做鐵證。</p>
<p>踏進影院來觀影片，是坐着欣賞面前的一切，座位對於觀衆接觸的重要性，比任何一切來得密切，尤其是靜坐兩小時，難保腰背腿股不發生酥麻的異感。大華的座椅，無論樓上樓下，採用同型的構造，座身的直徑橫徑，特別放闊，裝置的地位改低。墊心的彈璜加多，隨着各人的體重，發揮勻衡的彈性，一坐下去，鬆軟舒適，給予身心無上的快慰，更可避免久坐背酸的流弊。為了這一點，全院的座位，犧牲了不少，相反地為觀衆着想，這犧牲是値得犧牲的。</p>
<p>大華大戲院之雄姿</p>
<p>銀幕是觀衆線的集中點，第一要光線白亮而柔和。普通的銀幕，幕上滿佈着小孔眼，光線投射上去，强烈的光亮，全給孔眼透視過去，損害了光線的白亮。大華採用的是：美國最新發明「無孔天視線」銀幕，關於上述的弊病，旣可免除，光亮方面，也絲亳不走原樣，像雪一樣白亮，羢一樣軟和。</p>
<p>聲機是亞爾西愛最新型的正音機，發出來的聲音，和本人原音絲亳無異。密集自動式的燈箱，更加强發光與發音的效果。放映機也是第一家採用的新發明：文齊爾「愛斯」放映機，它的效用，在美洲各大影院中，已有事實的證明，絕無光線濃淡不勻或斷片中止的弊病。四壁牆上的正音紙拍，能够强調音響的行進，减除回音的刺擾，使得每個人的視覺與聽覺上，都感到無上的滿意。</p>
<p>控制冷氣與熱氣的，有最新型的空氣調節器，抽洩汚濁的人氣，輸送新鮮的淸氣。玲瓏的穿堂，幽美的複室，雅靜的茶室，給予每個人以莫大的便利。院內外的色調，美術化的漆色，人造石的晶潔地面，這一種美麗與豪華的氣派，彷彿身入帝皇宮殿所見的鬼斧神工。</p>
<p>每一個角落，都呈露着新的格局，每一方的磗瓦，都運用着新的匠心，把多人的腦筋與心血，來灌溉這一座新型的建築物，希冀每一個觀衆，都獲得滿意的享受與最高的娛樂。</p>
<h3>電影史上的奇蹟　女人　沒有一個男人　揭示女性內心的苦悶　搔着女人心中的癢處</h3>
<p>女人是人世間顚倒一切的原動力，多少帝皇，為了女人的蠱惑而覆亡，多少偉人，為了女人的策勵而成功；男人不可一刻無女人，女人也不可一刻離男人。這部「女人」影片，却另成一種新作風，沒有一個男人參演其中，可是時時刻刻劇情的進展，却脫不了男人的覊絆與範疇。</p>
<p>領銜主演的是：米高梅的當家台柱瑙瑪希拉，還有瓊克勞馥，洛塞琳羅姍寳琳高黛等全體女人一百三十五人。把女人日常的生活——美容，理髮，沐浴，按摩，修指甲，上街買東西；刻劃出一個明朗的輪廊，從吃飽着暖，閒嚼舌頭的挑撥中，逗引出一般啼笑交融的悲喜劇。每一句閒話，都印證着女人平常講過的話談；每一段刺激，都搔着女人心中的癢處，女人看了，也免不了微笑的點頭。</p>
<p>全片演出，充滿寶貴與金銀氣，華麗的新裝有二百三十七套，單單瑙瑪希拉一人，換穿了廿四套新裝，寳琳高黛的皮大衣，瓊克勞馥的髮髻，珍寳的首飾；無疑地將慫動全滬仕女的注視。時裝展覽的一幕，染以天然五彩，又增加說不盡言的美感，瓊克勞馥的下班浴缸洗浴，打破了攝製的最高紀錄，邊疆開拍十一小時，為了這塲戲，瓊克勞馥睡了兩天，才恢復了她的疲乏，重蘇了她的神經。</p>
<p>寳琳高黛和羅珊的一塲打架，是全片精彩表演的一幕，它把女人變態心理，顯明地的暴露出來，攢髮扭打，滿地亂滾，最後牙癢癢地把女褲撕破，狠狠地在羊脂白玉般的粉腿上咬上一口，妬恨的心理，全在這幾個動作上，發洩無遺。</p>
<p>人物個性描寫，有鹿一樣的和善，羊一樣的馴順，猴一樣的狡黠，狐一樣的猜疑，夜鷹一樣的陰詐，馬一樣的爽直，牛一樣的愚笨；「女人」是女人的臨床實驗的手術間，把她們的病態，亳不容情的表現在銀幕上，使您面紅耳赤，也使您心悅意服。</p>
<p>洛塞玲羅姍是全劇最出色的一人，她的作風完全變動，担任反角，一副做腔作調的功架，一嘴絮聒嘮叨的閑話；教人好氣好笑。她是金魚缸裏的黑魚精，鬧得六宅不安，雞犬不寧。</p>
<p>大門穿堂</p>
<p>花樓穿堂</p>
<h3>鉅片剪影　張張都是你要看的影片</h3>
<p>影片是電影院的總血管，它把握着全院的靈魂，它有號召的力量，把偌大一座戲院子擠得十十足足，沒有一些空隙。所以，影院最難解決的重心問題，就是影片的本身，尤其是一家新興的影院，更在難字上加上一個難字。</p>
<p>米高梅公司是影迷大家知道的一家最大影片公司，它擁有男女明星二十五人。最著名的女星：像瑙瑪希拉，葛雷泰嘉寳，珍妮麥唐納，茂娜洛埃，伊麗娜鮑慧兒，瓊克勞馥；最著名的男星，像克拉蓋博爾，威廉鮑惠爾，華雷斯皮萊，勃勞泰勒，詹姆斯史蒂華，奈爾遜埃第，茀雷亞斯坦等，都是米高梅的基本台柱，拍出來的片子，每部有每部値得欣賞的價値，它在電影史上保持最光榮的一頁，它的雄獅商標，也儼然成為衆片之王。</p>
<p>大華在創始的時候，就以疾雷不及掩耳的力量，簽訂了獨家放映米高梅影片的長期合同，這在影迷面前，無疑地是一個重大的喜訊，以全滬最新型第一線的影院，映全球最優秀第一線的影片，可說是美具難幷的盛事。</p>
<p>勞勃杜奈主演的「萬世師表」，是一部値得歌頌的教育鉅片。最大的成就，就是杜奈的演技，達到神化的頂巔。他從少年時代轉入壯年的舉止動作，描摹得淋漓盡致，入木三分。最後進入老年時代，步履也變樣了，說話也格外風趣了，聲音也突轉蒼老了，誰也不相信這樣一個角色，是他一個人扮演到底的。</p>
<p>這部片的內容與意義，它不但宣示畢生忠於教育的老教育家，不倦的訓迪子弟，同時鼓勵每個人要忠於國家。他以一個年老退休的資格，在國難日深的戰亂中，重行担負起教育的全副責任，就是大轟炸之夜，他始終出以鎭靜，選拿幽默的笑話，來消散恐怖的雰圍氣，這一股剛毅的勇氣，値得每個人　法。</p>
<p>要形容「綠野仙踪」的佳妙，一枝生花妙筆會失去它的效果。只有親眼目覩，才能解決這困難，裏面有許許多多事蹟是筆墨無法形容的。</p>
<p>神話中的駕霧騰雲，飛沙走石，霧光萬道，魔火十丈，呼風喚雨，仙　鬥法的種種奇蹟，在這部「綠野仙踪」中，運用科學萬能的力量，整個兒搬上銀幕，活生生地表現出來，登塲人物有稻草人，錫樵夫，懦獅，女巫，在神秘莫測的神話裏，包含着一個切合人生的故事，不畏難，不怕死，不屈服，得到最後勝利，正是本片暗示的一切。</p>
<p>動用的資本，是超過米高梅任何鉅片，要花費到三百萬美金的鉅數，監製人茂文李洛埃，擁有廣大的聲譽，像「風流世家」「熱血雄心」，都是他導演的傑作，導演是製作「小婦人」的喬治柯葛，以手法明朗，佈局緊凑，有名於時。</p>
<p>全片染以美麗天然五彩，演員多至五千人，領銜主演的最近崛起的歌唱童星裘蒂珈綸，她在「金玉滿堂」中，有着非常佳妙的演出，本片更有驚奇的收穫，本年度成本最鉅的五彩鉅片，要算「綠野仙踪」是第一部。</p>
<p>天下男女愛侶，為了誤會，釀成了多少慘史，創傷了多少心靈。「情天歌侶」寫一對秘密結婚的藝人，為了職業問題，雙方隱秘了好了好久，等到女的成名立業，男的誤會出走，悲歎離合，從此開端，甜酸苦辣，籠罩畫面。</p>
<p>珍妮麥唐納的忠於藝術，是任何人不能否認的事實。她扮演本劇的貧苦藝人，有極精妙的演出。從賣藝成名，失戀，離異與重合的過程中，她無時無刻不把愛憐丈夫的寸寸柔腸，從眉目間表現出來，使人憐憫，　欣，悲傷與同情；隨時把電影觀衆的情緒，騷動到一個莫名的境地。全片以表演為主，歌唱為輔，這是電影製作人迎合觀衆心理最好的手法。麥唐納的歌喉，本來有金嗓子的尊稱，加着她表演認眞，使得全片迴腸盪氣，使人心裏有說不出的難受。</p>
<p>男主角劉亞理斯，在「西線無戰事」一片中，建樹了十倍聲價。這次東山再起，跟麥唐納配戲，也有非常高妙的演出，把相親相愛，又妒又恨的心理，曲曲達出，發洩無遺。</p>

<p>自發糾正　昌明廉恥</p>

<h3>供應委員會昨商議　再度壓低米價　俟過相當時間再加平抑　公會建議大量彙購洋米　籌劃二次平糶</h3>
<p>豆米業公會前致函虞洽卿、請一依照前次申請外滙辦理平糶例、再行救濟平民及抑平米價、昨晚據某有力人士語大中社記者、謂此舉將於下星期　、由本埠商界某有力人士、與銀行界協商後、始行辦理、其辦法或係由滬市之重要團體合作、共同負擔經費、而此項經費、將由銀行界先行墊款、至於申請合法外滙、亦將於是日商決後、呈電中央懇予核准、</p>
<p>工部局食物燃料供應委員會於昨日（十一日）下午二時召開會議、出席委員馬希爾爵士（英國商會主席）·艾味萊（達孚洋行經理）·哈頓（太古洋行經理）·等、工部局財務警務衛生處長均列席、據新聲社記者之探悉、席間對於米糧限價後現時市况、曾加以詳盡之檢討，而尤注意於此次限制實行後、各方奉行情形　至現時限價（即最高白粳不得超過四十五元、最高秈米及洋米不得超過三十八元）、經過若干時間、再行抑低問題、亦經會塲縝密研商、各出席人員對於維護本市民食之關懷、頗具熱忱、聞商討結果、決定現時嚴厲執行公告所規定之限價、一面再審察存底及到米情形、以期達到抑低米價惠濟平民之初衷、又據　文人美晚報云、工部局總辦兼總裁費利溥、於今（十一日）晨十時三十分赴央總領署作私人之拜訪、費氏對渠此行，拒不發表任何言論、惟衆信費氏係與吳領署官員討論目下米况之發展、</p>
<p>相當抑平再訂限價</p>
<p>租界當局之取締米糧囤積投機操縱之布告、已於昨日由各該管捕房分別揭貼於各處、告示市民一體知照、該項布告係中英文各　張、各界市民對於是項佈告頗爲注意、咸貯立詳讀細察、表示極度贊同當局之措置、聞租界當局、對於此次嚴訂米價限價後、決定切實執行、如再有操縱囤積情形、必予嚴厲取締、昨日米價已略跌落、預料可望繼續下降、據消息靈通方面稱、目下所訂之限價、當爲臨時救急辦法、俟米價下降至自然水平綫時、則現時限價、將繼續降低、務使米價經相當時間、益趨平定、</p>
<p>米商對當局之反響</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、本市米商對於法租界公董局與公共租界工部局就囤積與操縱米糧事所頒佈告、今日（十一日）已起喧擾、認爲此項佈告乃破壞自己之目的、若輩並欲知佈告何以不述及煤斤或房租等項、據某米商今日告記者稱、工部局有何權力可沒收合法商人之存米歟、若果發生此種情事、則米商受驚、將停止輸入米糧、而米之騰貴、乃因日人沿途收捐稅所致、怖告中何以僅述及米糧、而其他食物以及煤斤與房租等則置不提云、記者今晨以工部局有何權力可沒收存米　節、叩諸工部局某員、據答稱、法律上無此規定、但工部局在自然產生之緊急權力下、當可出此、局方希望不致發生此種必要、</p>
<p>違令米商澈底處置</p>
<p>記者問、沒收存米、給予何種償補、該發言人答稱、此事未曾加以考慮、但如發生此種局面、則此點當然須加考慮、記者又問、工部局何弗遏制他物如煤斤與房租等等價格昂貴、發言人答稱、工部局認米糧爲最顯著之例證、日後局方或不得不遏制他物之騰貴、記者復問、工部局將如何逐米商出公共租界、據答稱、押彼等人駛往越南之船中云、此語表示局方與法當局之密切合作、發言人又稱、工部局雖明瞭米糧在市外、被勒索捐稅、但認爲本國米之售價過高、因投機者乃根據西貢米價、而定本國米之價格也云、</p>
<p>建議商會集團購米</p>
<p>豆米行業同業公會昨除將前報所載議定之治本治標辦法函公共租界工部局法租界公董局察照外、並建議上海市商會集團訂購洋米、原函云「敬啟者、查近日滬地米價、增漲不已、攸關民生與治安者甚巨、自應設法補救、以期平衡、屬會爰於本月九日召集執監會議、議定治標治本各項方策、如治標方面、接受工部局意旨、重行規定限價、治本方面、函請兩租界當局、設法疏通來源等項、茲不備述、而尤須陳請於鈞會者、計有　事、（一）虞洽卿先生前曾發起集團訂購洋米、事未果行、今爲求民食之充足、仍宜訂購洋米、現雖有少數米業行號之訂購、尚覺力薄而效微、擬請鈞會會同兩租界當局暨虞先生、邀集各公團代表商議分別集團訂購辦法、務期各公團各就所屬公司行號工廠以及自由職業者、各計其所需、分別集合、大量訂購、如是則力宏而效巨、民食旣充、米價不患不平矣、（二）目前米價高漲、升斗小民最爲痛苦、前虞先生曾請准法定外滙、訂購洋米、舉辦平糶、雖爲數不多、而貧民受惠已非淺、今擬請鈞會會同虞先生援照前例、再度呈請財政部、准予撥給法定外滙若干、約可訂購洋米五萬包之數、一面轉請銀錢業墊款採購、以便再行舉辦平糶、救濟貧民、（三）目前米價旣貴、採運成本隨之倍增、欲求來貨之增多、端賴資力之充足、故擬請鈞會轉知銀錢業、對於採辦國米或洋米者、儘量放款、以便採運、而增來源、以上三事、實爲目前切要之圖、至祈俯賜採納、迅予照辦、庶足使米價平衡、民生安定、不勝企禱之至、謹致上海市商會、」此外、並致函虞洽卿協助辦理、詞意略同、</p>
<p>市塲穩定洋米續到</p>
<p>米業茶會市塲以昨日爲執行工部局限價之第二日、市塲管委會主席符前耕、曁値日委昌張利忠·鄭升雲·及兩租界委派之監督人員、均到塲監視、同業交易、又因兩租界當局對投機壟斷米糧者、有不予保護或驅逐出境、而將其存貨充公之嚴厲懲罰、故市塲交易、更趨穩定、而賣空買空以圖牟利者、亦爲之匿跡、茲據某米商談、滬米商前所訂購之洋米、除陸續到滬外、昨日復到有西貢米四萬包、由馬勒輪裝運來滬、目下各米商已訂購之洋米、尚未運滬者、計有三十萬包、若該項已訂購之洋米能於週內抵滬、則滬市洋米將更見充足、</p>
<h3>大新糾紛解決　先施昨日怠工　工部局已派員從事調處　勞資雙方當可洽商解決</h3>
<p>自本埠物價騰漲、米貴如珠、平民生計、均感影響、近日工商界職工先後請求資方酌加薪津、以維生計者、所幸勞資雙方、均能互體時艱、故得於協調原則下、覓得適當之公平解決、僅大新公司職工曾於、日因所提請求當時未獲結果、以致發生短時間之怠工、嗣亦即告圓滿解決、昨日已照常營業、此外先施公司職工七百餘人、續於昨晨怠工、公司當局謂已電香港總行請示、大致如資方能相當接受意見、當可望即日解決、茲將各情、分誌如下、</p>

<p>大新怠工全部解決</p>
<p>該公司職工、自前日下午實行怠工後、於十日晚八時、再派代表晋謁公司監督蔡昌、懇請俯念同人終年辛勞、向來動於職守、此次要求改善待遇、全係環境壓迫而同人等更無所苛求、祇求能在此百物昂貴聲中、生活不受過分之恐慌、於願已足、交涉至晚十二時、蔡監督遂將司人所提出之四項要求、全部酌予接受、即（一）加薪問題、准自本月份起、（二）分派紅利、亦由本年舊歷年終實行、惟不限於每月每元提三角五分、而以整個月薪計算、至少每人加發薪金二月、（三）恢復補工、此項當局認爲原則接受、惟須聯合其他公司公議、大新不能單獨應允、（四）職業絕對保障、代表等認爲滿意、立即召集全體同人、報告與蔡監督接洽經過、同人亦認爲交涉圓滿、一致决議於昨晨恢復營業、同人會遂即發出布告、勗勉全體同人、嗣後宜各盡本位、勤奮從公、以副當局囑望之殷、而符勞資雙方精誠團結之旨、渡此非常時期之難關、於是滿天雲霧、一掃而空、實不幸中之大幸也、</p>

<h3>法租界新聞河　鐵門昨已開放　五日之後將續開新北門鐵門　以後人口新北門出口新開河</h3>
<p>法租界開放毘連南市民國路鐵門之說、甚囂塵上、但終以治安問題、遲遲未見諸事實、刻以法租界公董局鑒於市民進出南市、繞道沛東、殊感不便、爲示體恤起見、爰有將新開河鐵門、於本月十日開放之議、後以手續及佈置問題、始改於昨日起、</p>

<p>前往探視</p>
<p>法租界黃浦灘沿新開河一帶、扶老携幼進出南市者、人數殊形擁擠、法租界爲維持秩序計、於新開河入口處、派有華探在塲指揮、進入南市或出租界者、咸沿左邊行人道上行走、中央爲汽車通行道、記者員擊日海軍人員通入租界、悉假</p>

<h3>乘脚踏車販米　被扣四百餘輛</h3>
<p>滬市糧食自被日方統制後、來源稀少、價格飛漲、近復將各家轉運公司裝米派司、一律吊銷、以致米糧不能運往租界、一般操縱之囤戶、乘機抬高價格、漫無限止、而內地米商、因無人購買、市面反而呆滯、鄉民見有利可圖、咸用脚踏車裝運、由滬西中山路·經閘北至虹口·折八租界、每日可獲利十餘元、故近數日來、此項米販、絡繹不絕、現被林肯路滬西班日軍部突然禁止、將車米一併扣留、故前昨兩日被扣者、已有四百餘輛之多云、</p>

<p>三審裁判</p>
<p>房客均遭敗訴、而迄强制執行之期、中間因房客方面値此非常時期、滬埠房屋求過於供、無法遷移、致糾紛迭起、乃最近房客方面、查悉在第二審辯論終結前、女子銀行已與貧兒敎養院成立和解、由貧兒敎養院允許展期三年、再予翻造、並减低租金、爰延袁仰安•蘇景祺•俞承修•律師向高二分院</p>
<p>提起再審</p>
<p>之訴業經高院照准、一度開庭、觀令出外和解在案、昨此案由高二分院民庭長韓祖植·偕沈鴻·章慶瀾•推事開庭續訊、先由袁律師起稱、在改期之內、再審原告方面由敝律師代表致函女子銀行提起和解辦法、（一）展延租賃時期、（二）房客允酌量增加租金、（三）雙方因訴訟而蒙之損失、應核實予以計算互相</p>
<p>賠償辦法</p>
<p>實極公允、乃女子銀行方面根本無和解之意思、且代理人曾與該行姚經理商談、亦無回復云云、而女子銀行代理律師之聲稱、則謂關於和解一點、女子銀行因房客方面之代理權尚有問題、故去函請將代理權一點提證說明、乃未見答復、致無談判之餘地、庭上即詢以房客方面既已提出和解辦法、則女子銀行方面亦應有一種辦法、俾能</p>
<p>互相磋商</p>
<p>成立和解、但該律師則稱、關於房客方面之提出辦法、實難有磋商餘地、故顯難成立云云、旋經庭上向雙方就事實法律上詳予訊問後、即諭令開始辯論、先由袁仰安律師辯稱、查女子銀行起訴之理由、厥爲與貧兒敎養院所訂立之合同、因該合同內載明逾二十八年一月一日期、而不將屋翻建、則女子銀行將蒙受二十萬元以上之損失、今該合同旣已</p>
<p>延期三年</p>
<p>則女子銀行即根本無受損失之虞、且查在現時情形非常、房屋求過於供、覓屋艱難、並非房客之故意爲難、堅不遷讓、今旣獲此新事實之證據、房客方面乃提起本件之訴、請求庭上依照證據、廢棄原審之判决、並令女子銀行負擔全部訴訟費用、繼由俞律師更就所獲證據、予以說明、蘇律師正欲辯論、庭上以時已過午、乃宣告辯論中止、定期再予辯論、</p>

<h3>燈下走筆</h3>
<p>— 秦佬</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>丹麥哲人吉爾刻哥爾雖然以神秘論者出名，但他却總是常用峻烈的筆調把眼前的社會批評得體無完膚。我從杜林格爾（R．Dolinger）所編纂的德文本「吉爾刻哥爾警語集」（「So　Spricht　Soren　Kierkegaard」)中看見了這樣的一段：</p>
<p>所謂時代，從全體看來，便是革新的，完全要從最初開始而捨棄傳統的…但是看罷，在日常生活，在實際生活，形成這時代底當前的人們，却都以呼出援救傳統爲最上的思想，而這個思想又極不容易拋棄。例如商人每日在新聞上登廣吿，希望從重複不斷的事件上，得到非經過幾十年不能得到的傳統力量，便是。</p>
<p>這情形到處皆然。是的！可以說我們時代底商業與貿易，實際正是由巧妙的方法來追隨傳統的。</p>
<p>這樣，人們所想的事是如此：想從已經無用了的那種古式的傳統中離開，而希望盡可能地快一點確立作爲代用物的傳統，即由巧妙的方法來實踐的傳統。</p>
<p>人們以爲自己是革新的，而討厭所稱爲傳習的所有的東西。——但集納主義者盡可能地在短時期之中對於民衆推進一種傳習，却又正是爲的顯示革新的。——注意罷，這種傳習對於這種所謂人類底恩惠者是怎樣的便利呀！</p>
<p>這話說得好像隱晦了一點，但却實在深刻得很。這現象在我們眼前到處都是，用不着再來舉例。照吉爾刻哥爾看來，凡是用巧妙的方法維持傳統的，都是商人底行爲罷了。可是眞正說來，這意思也並不過分。我們且看看目前那般用了許多巧妙的解釋要靑年去讀「古文」的先生們，實際上是不是爲了生意經？</p>
<p>在同一書中又有一條：</p>
<p>我在猶太底巨騙狄萊所寫的東西裏面讀到了傳佈很普遍的那個柏林人的——也就是黎本達爾一族中之一人的——强盜的故事。他是猶太人，先本是當着扒掱，因爲做得極不順利，於是在公正的「天界」之下（在猶太人，所謂「天界」是特別有重大的意義的，至少狄萊是這樣說）發了大誓，對神說：無論如何再不作扒掱那樣的事了。他守着他底信約——但轉瞬間他却去做了强盜。等到他再從牢裏出來了，他便再向神祈願，發誓再不做强盜了。——但這回他却去做了騙子。</p>
<p>這雖然說的是猶太人，但却和我們目前時髦的「排猶」無關，所注重的只是在說明這樣的一種典型。但也不知道是不是我底神經過敏，我總覺得這好像是在我們某一些不斷轉變的名人和作家底身上開刀。</p>
<h3>語文小故事</h3>
<p>— 柷敔</p>
<p>天堂裏的話</p>
<p>亞當曾在天堂裏學會了話，什麽話呢？這是一個大問題，苦煞了許多「學者」。</p>
<p>聖傑洛米（St．Jerome）說：『一切文獻證明了寫成一舊約」的希伯萊語是人類的最早言語。』如果這樣，倒也沒有什麽；但後來各民族語興起，都想把自己的語言歸到天堂裏去，分岐就出來了。</p>
<p>哥洛庇護世（Goropius）說荷蘭語是天堂語。剛柏（Kempe）不贊成，說，在天堂裏，上帝向亞當說瑞典語，亞當則以丹麥語回答，那可惡的蛇向夏娃說話時用法語。愛羅（Erro）在他的大著「原始世界」裏說，巴斯克語是亞當的語言。在東方的敎徒，論調又不同，據波斯人的「意見」，亞當同夏娃的話是波斯語，大天使說土耳其語，蛇則說阿拉伯語。</p>
<p>「多元論」有一個缺點：天堂裏的話這麼不統一，會話起來大概很困難了。不過，據我們的判斷，「多元論」的眞意是在宣揚本國語言的優秀，輕視外國語。</p>
<p>各有所司</p>
<p>中國人相信：蘇州話是女人的，北平話是男人的，寗波話是商人的，揚州話是工人的，各有所司。外國人也這樣：婦人講意大利語，男人講法蘭西語，鳥講英國語，馬講德語，上帝講西班牙語。我想問問諸位，你能用你學來的英語跟鳥談話嗎？如果眞的，公冶長便不能傳美一方了。</p>
<p>語言的各有所司在古代印度尤其明顯，女人說柏拉克利德（Prakrit），有特權的男人說桑斯克利德（Sanskrit）。這樣的語言禁律在今蠻族還盛行。</p>
<p>卡立波（Carib）佔領小安蒂利斯島（Small　Antilles）的時候，把所有的男人都殺光，只剩下女人來作繁殖之用，結果男女兩性的話截然不同，男的話女的也懂，但從來不說，反之也然。因之，兒子講男人話，女兒講女子話。所以，「我的爸爸」一句話，女的呌起來是Noukouchili，男的呌起來是Voumaan，男女一起呌的時候是Baaba。契基托土人（Chiquitos）也這樣：男人講「到家裏去」有三種說法：Yebotu　ti　n-ipoostu（他到他家裏去），Yebotu　ti　ipoos（他到她家裏去），Yebo　ti　n-ipoostu（她到他家裏去）；但女人只有一種說法，就是Yeboti　n-ipoos（她到她家裏去）。在澳州華拉孟加（Warramunga）土人甚至令孀婦用手勞。</p>
<p>救救女人！</p>
<h3>祖國底孩子們</h3>
<p>— 曙晞</p>
<p>在路傍，我遇着了淸，他吿訴我一個消息；欣慰充滿了我底心頭，是的，我應當歡送他們。</p>
<p>踏上了石階，走進一位畫人的畫室。他們伸出了熱誠的手和我緊緊地握着。</p>
<p>「朋友！決定要走了嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，我們要投向祖國的懷抱裏去！」這有力的回答，充溢了無垠的興奮與堅決。我凝視着他們光采煥發的面容；壁上懸着塞尙（P．Cezanne）梵高（V．Gogh）作風的潑辣奔放的幾幀油畫，光·熱·力充滿了我的周圍，我忘却了這正是個嚴寒的黃昏。</p>
<p>沒有富豪們的山珍海饈，醇酒美人，一張小方桌，九個人挨緊地圍坐着，幾碟瓜子，花生，蛋糕，餅乾，幾盅淸茶，這是燕師爲他們備下了的餞別之突，可是，在這些茶點中，大家嘗到了無上的師生的熱情！</p>
<p>王師是當中年齡最長的一位，他說：「你們這次的走，我很高興！是的，靑年人，這時候不替祖國出力，還等待啥辰光呢！說起來，我也够慚愧啊……」你們脫離了這樊籠，你們可以深深地呼吸到自由淸新的空氣了。那兒，無處不是充滿着一幅輻偉大雄壯的畫面……</p>
<p>我說不出甚麽來，我默然地想着自己，在流浪的生涯中，消逝了悠長的幾年光陰，如今又因覊在這樊籠裏，爲了生活嗎？然而生活在這黝灰陰影之中……</p>
<p>燕師股殷地囑咐着他們，勉勵着他們，——這一位慈母啊！</p>
<p>「你這次的走，曾經吿訴過你的家長嗎？」王師很關心地問着少菲，這一位新婚未久，家境寬裕的年靑人。</p>
<p>講過了；他們都說：『孩子！你是屬於祖國的！』……</p>
<p>大家的手掌都拍拍地鼓着，算給他一個光榮興奮的回答</p>
<p>爲了時間的關係，我不能不先走了，在歸途中，尖銳的朔風吹着，但熱情仍蘊繞在我底心坎，我默念着雪萊的詩句：「如果冬大到了，春天還會遠嗎！……」我祝福他們。</p>
<h3>悼葉紫</h3>
<p>— 芷靜</p>
<p>傳來消息：葉紫先生於十月五日在原籍湖南益陽縣逝世了。</p>
<p>葉紫先生年靑得很，但是生活是艱苦的，多方面的，他的經歷，魯迅先生說過：「抵得太平天下順民的一世紀的經歷。」他所見，所遇，所聞，觀感甚多，他運用一枝不十分靈活的筆，寫出了世界的陰陽面，顯示着一個世界的狂妄，卑鄙，齷齪，壓迫……，另一個世界的馴服，忍受，悲慘的命運，奮鬥與掙扎……</p>
<p>魯迅先生編輯奴隸叢書，以他的短篇集「豐收」作最初的獻禮。這三百多頁的篇幅中，充滿了「火樣的熱情，血和淚的現實的堆砌」。在技巧上，作者理智的自己承認：「太缺少藝術成分」，「對於人物的把捉，故事的穿揷，往往都顯得笨拙。」，「有些地方叙述得太多，描寫得太少。」但是，充實的內容使讀者感受悲憤之外，並不覺得有大缺憾之可言；何况，我們的作者年事尙靑，他「能够虛心的接受一切善意的批評」，他「能够刻苦的，辛勤的不斷的學習」，他想在「保持原有的熱情，加强技術的修養和生活的體騐」的努力下，貢獻出「像樣的東西」（自謙辭）來，但是現在是賚志以歿了。</p>
<p>不錯，他曾計劃寫一部反映祖國革命的巨製「太陽從西邊出來」，並且在貧病交迫中埋首工作來使它出現，但是，天不永年，無情地攫走了他的生命，這該爲我們文搜深致遺憾的。</p>
<p>葉紫先生身後蕭條孤寡待助。港地文藝界同仁夏衍、立波、郁風、艾蕪、楊剛、戴望舒、新皮、奚如爲之發起募捐以贍遺族。上海方面，想不乏葉紫先生的友好，爲了紀念，並使這位文化戰士的瞑目，請伸出你們的手來盡一些責任。（酬移葉紫先生遺族贍養金）</p>

<h3>大華巡禮</h3>
<p>— 樂</p>
<p>大華大戲院今日正式開幕，在本年度海上游樂史中該是很光榮的一節。大華的前身原是一家首先開映有聲電影的「夏令匹克」，它爲了種種原因，停閉多年，在這過程中，我們走過門口，不禁望宇興嘆！如今，這靜寂破落的院宇，一變而爲富麗堂皇的藝術之宮，且將以活躍姿態，吸引盈千累萬的影迷，確是一件可喜可賀的事</p>
<p>開幕前夕特往巡禮，在半小時之內，所有一切新型設備，全映眼簾，深佩設計諸君貢獻的偉大。以溫度而言，一般戲院冬天往往水汀過熱，而夏天冷氣過寒，反使人體上受着不良的影響，而大華對控制冷熱氣，裝有新型空氣調節器，抽洩汚濁的空氣，輸送新鮮的淸氣；以光綫而言，大華採用新發明的「無孔天視綫」銀幕，故光綫白亮而柔和，不致損害觀衆的目光；以聲機而言，大華採用新式的文齊爾「愛斯」放映機，絕無光綫濃淡不勻或斷片中止的流弊；「聲光座」三美俱全，眞是難能可貴。</p>
<p>甚願大華當局，能於此種優美設備之外，再與選片精審，服務周到，售價從廉，接受觀衆意見……，相配合，我相信前程是極有希望的。</p>
<h3>搜孤救孤（下）</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>譚鑫培晚年偶演此劇之程嬰，必以賈洪林配公孫杵臼，黃澗甫扮屠岸賈，珠連璧合，膾炙人口，然未聞帶演報仇，證以前述王雨田此段唱白，知老譚必演過，且甚著名其時大約在民國前，光緒末，老譚自組同慶班演於中和園，因王之唱全學譚氏，譚氏若無此塲，王斷無此唱也。（吾藏有王唱此片，譚調風味最足）陂簧班中演潞安洲屬之武老生，多不帶八大鎚之斷臂說書歸宗，而演王佐斷臂者，無不帶觀畫歸宗者，重返本歸宗並大快人心也。今演搜孤救孤獨無連帶報仇者，豈非憾事？吾主張此種佳劇，可排全本，即令不排全本，亦非帶演觀畫報仇不可；不如此，則觀者不知孤兒之活不活，大仇之報不報也。老伶工家，或有此全本，否則向北平伶界求之，求之不得，則可參考史跡，及崑曲之八義圖重編之，此等工作，吾覺非難事也；政府方提倡八德，程嬰公孫二人之救孤，爲德多矣，忠義之氣，堅忍之性，互古稀有其足鼓勵今世者大矣。彼爲救一性之孤耳，能拚死持久而不辭，若引而伸之，吾人爲救社會，爲救國家，此種捨生取義，殺身成仁之精神，其可不追慕思齊哉？况演之戲劇，演之通俗之二簧戲，則感人深矣，則此種好戲，亟宜提倡，故吾不憚詞費而長言之也。</p>
<p>程嬰公孫杵臼之墓在山西絳州太平縣趙村，係宋神宗朝勅河東路各官訪尋得之，詔封程嬰爲成信侯，公孫杵臼爲忠智侯，命絳州立廟，歲時致祭，修廟之將作監爲進士吳處厚，因神宗朝皇嗣屢闕，鄆王多病，處厚上表以爲本朝趙氏，實爲晋國趙武子之裔，（即趙氏孤兒）當時若無程嬰公孫杵臼二人之救護，則趙氏無孑遺，亦無今日宋朝之基業，蓋宋太祖匡胤之先世，皆生於河朔，乃趙武靈王之後，武靈王父趙武之十世孫也。趙武曾爲程嬰服三年之喪，立祠祭奠，今祠墓無跡，祀典久闕，二人之鬼無所歸，恐因是爲厲也，宜求其墓廟，特加封爵，以報其功，則忠義有勸，儲嗣繁衍云。見吳處厚自著之靑箱雜記。程嬰杵臼二人之墓廟皆因吳氏之請而願，且封侯爵，此事社會間知者甚少故表而出之。</p>

<h3>梨園外紀</h3>

<p>貫大元擅演永安宮漢陽院等老戲</p>
<p>自此以下卽係先主養疴永安宮，時距託孤匪遙也。先主夜夢關張顯魂，大哭而覺，遂有哭靈牌一塲，中加悲壯蒼凉之反西皮兩大段，歷叙三人大破黃巾，三戰呂布，以及關張武略等，音調悲哀，能令聞者酸鼻。此乃反西皮之特徵，今人每以爲反西皮自老譚始者實誤。後先主病益加重，武侯自川來白帝城，受先主託孤之重，時馬謖在側，以言忤上，爲先主掌頰，並謂孔明曰「馬謖言過其實，終無大用。」是卽「空城計」孔明說白中「……先帝託孤之時言道……」所由來也。惟劇中飾馬謖者，並非武凈，乃由一小花面扮演，頭帶黑扎巾，穿綠開氅，掛小吊搭，與「空城計」中之裝扮，大相懸殊。聞此劇係叔岩之祖余三勝之老本子，大元因幼年曾從名敎師賈麗川（賈洪林之叔）習劇，而麗川家藏老脚本甚多，故大元乃得此秘傳也。</p>
<p>（二）漢陽院　此劇又名哭劉表，哭時的調子也是反西皮，反西皮這種腔調，在劇中很不多見，有人說這是二六的反調，過門托腔都相類似，二六的句尾多走高音，反西皮每句之尾聲則低而緩，故上說亦頗有理。不過所令人不可解者，何以這種調子都讓劉先主專用在「哭……」哭「……」上面，豈非因爲劉備是善哭的專家，故而特許他享有專用權麽？漢陽院這齣戲，不但大元擅演，並且他還以此劇敎過連良，於比就可見他的爲人是很謙恭和靄，並不像那種自私自利的人把好本子藏起來不肯傳人的呢。（一五八）</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Correcting the Rice Market</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the Municipal Council of the French Concession jointly issued a notice yesterday, severely warning those who hoard, speculate, and monopolize rice in the concessions, saying that they will not be protected, or will be deported and their stocks confiscated; and hoping that residents in the concessions will cooperate with the Municipal Council and report any such incidents truthfully, so that they can be punished. Since some unscrupulous people in Shanghai have used rice as a target for speculation, causing the price of rice to rise, the lives of millions of residents have been directly oppressed, and the peace and order of the two concessions have been indirectly affected. This newspaper has repeatedly and earnestly discussed this matter for the past two weeks, saying, "The livelihood of five million residents is entrusted to the hands of speculative merchants; and allowing speculation to go unchecked without sanctions is unique to Shanghai today, in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad." "Shanghai is not without well-organized and well-functioning institutions, but in terms of the market and the people's livelihood, it is in a state of anarchy." Therefore, we advocate mobilizing "the authority of various organizations and institutions to sanction unscrupulous merchants." "Under the premise of the welfare of the residents and the security of the concessions, take all possible methods to apply direct and indirect pressure." "In addition to investigating the amount of rice in stock and the amount arriving in port each day, as well as its purchase price, we should also investigate its hoarding, pledging, manipulation, etc., and investigate the names of the people in charge of the operation; crimes must be punished, and those that cannot be punished by law should be frequently interrogated, and inconveniences should be imposed on their business, residence, life, and related aspects; publicize them, without leaving them any dignity"; and in terms of fundamental solutions, we have advocated clearing the sources, centralizing buying and selling, and ordering foreign rice. Now, the authorities of the two concessions have resolutely adopted severe sanctions, as announced yesterday. This newspaper did not initially think that words had power and public opinion would work; however, among the recent achievements of the concession authorities, this move is the most capable of meeting the urgent needs, benefiting the residents, stabilizing the security, and also the most capable of observing public opinion and greatly satisfying the people.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's announcement has been posted in thoroughfares and published in yesterday's newspapers; parallel to the announcement, the rice industry has announced price limits. It is reported that, in accordance with the intention of the concession authorities, the maximum price for white japonica rice is limited to 45 yuan per picul, and for indica rice, 38 yuan per picul. This price limit is not explicitly stated in the announcement, but the people secretly discuss that it is too high. Because once the price is limited, rice merchants will regard it as the minimum price of rice; looking at the results of previous price limits, the price of inferior rice has often gradually risen to the limited price. The quality of rice with green waist, white navel, chaff, and gravel forces consumers to seek better and more complete rice grains for cooking, so as to avoid wasting more; then the rice merchants can manipulate and extort by taking the opportunity, saying that if you want good rice, you should pay a higher price, which is a vicious means of indirectly raising prices and causing substantial damage. Consumers can only endure the hidden pain helplessly, and the authorities will also suffer from "there is a reason for the incident, but there is no evidence to investigate," and end up with nothing. Therefore, some commentators say that if Shanghai's food supply still adopts price limits, why not set a wide limit after the old price limit has been newly broken, and why not limit speculation and hoarding to the stage when prices are advancing daily within 40 yuan, but wait until the price of rice has risen to this point before imposing restrictions; this still does not deprive the hoarders of the opportunity to profit, only harms the general public. It is said that this must be because the rice merchants use the reason that high prices are difficult to limit, and must use the "pulling teeth from a tiger" to obstruct the attempt. Not only that, but price limits are only a temporary solution, only able to temporarily curb the rising trend; if there is no management system to regulate it later, then the previous cart will be a lesson, and disrupting the peace will not be difficult; when the third restriction is reached, the price of rice will not know how high it has risen. What's more, rice merchants secretly sabotage, and there are a hundred loopholes, which are difficult to prevent and control. All this, the residents, in addition to praising the concession authorities' resolute measures this time, are still full of worries and doubts.</p>
<p>The people's food supply is an important matter in a government without government, and it is also a huge social problem. If we expect to cure both the symptoms and the root cause with a single notice, and dispel all worries and doubts, that is an excessive hope; if this matter could be solved so simply, then it would not be an important matter, not be a big problem, and this announcement would not have been issued yesterday. It is important to know that although the organizations and institutions in the concessions are large in scale, there is no special agency responsible for the people's food supply, nor is there a reserve of manpower, financial resources, or other necessary material resources. And now, the ability to take strict measures is due to the urgent need in fact, and also because some objective conditions allow for such strictness. Because the inventory in the concessions is sufficient for several months of consumption, there is no worry that unscrupulous merchants will threaten to stop transportation, this is one. The new grain in the rice-producing areas is on the market, which is not comparable to the time when there is a fundamental shortage, this is two. Rice prices in various places are also quite high, which especially makes farmers happy to sell at this time, this is three. The transportation of goods is not smooth, there is no worry that rice will flow out, and the high price of rice is also not conducive to outflow, this is four. Rice is as expensive as pearls and firewood, and complaints are heard everywhere, which has become the most powerful driving force for the concession authorities to punish and warn, and at this time, when punishment is launched, unscrupulous merchants dare not play tricks to resist and disobey, this is five. Only these five points make us believe that the announcement is adapted to the environment, and that the announcement will not ultimately be just a piece of paper.</p>
<p>This single announcement this time will be effective, but it is not the ultimate. I think there must be something to follow the announcement: First, we should reward reports in a timely manner, so that those who hoard and speculate will not dare to act recklessly. Second, we should thoroughly investigate the hoarding of large households in the concessions and selectively levy or confiscate them. Third, we should gradually adopt management measures, investigate the source on a daily basis, centralize the market, publicly evaluate prices, and distribute them to various rice shops. If there is surplus grain, we should use the method of public reserves. Fourth, we should urgently clear the sources and find other ways to provide assistance. Fifth, we should hold the spare house accountable and use its special right to public prosecution to bring those who endanger the public's survival to justice, using criminal law to punish one as a warning to a hundred. Sixth, we should mobilize capable and incorruptible detectives, and specially invite some legitimate people from the industrial and commercial circles, to investigate in various ways whether unscrupulous merchants are selling inferior rice at the highest limited price, or selling better rice at a higher price; if this is the case, we must punish them severely. Seventh, we should urge the warehouses to expedite the withdrawal of stored rice. Eighth, we should urge the financial sector to expedite the repayment of the pledge of rice warehouse receipts, and we will punish them all. In short, we must use the spirit of acting quickly and decisively to achieve the rule of law with thunderous force. We must suppress unscrupulous merchants and not allow them to make plans for speculation, or have any hope of waiting and seeing; if these people see the determination of the concession authorities and the enthusiastic cooperation of officials and people, but seek a small profit and sell out to protect their normal principal and interest, then it is believed that the market price will fall below the limit price, which is very possible.</p>
<h3>Britain and France Block German Trade; Soviet Union Lodges Strong Protest, Believes It Infringes on the Rights of Neutral Countries; Japanese Ship Carrying German Munitions Postpones Departure</h3>
<p>Moscow - The British government announced an order on November 28 to block German exports, stating that the British government prohibits all goods from German ports and German products from being transported by sea to other countries through neutral ports. Ships carrying the above-mentioned goods must enter British and French ports, where Britain and France will confiscate or forcibly sell all the goods. Neutral ships carrying goods exported from the ports of countries directly connected to Germany must sail to British and French ports for inspection. Regarding this order, the Soviet government recently sent a note to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union on December 10, protesting against the above-mentioned measures of Britain, believing that they violated the rights of neutral countries. The note first reviewed that the Soviet government had stated on October 25 that it disagreed with Britain's measures to ban war contraband, because it violated international law and disrupted maritime trade. This time, the British government's November 28 order to block German exports further harmed the interests of neutral countries. Britain's method of conducting economic warfare can be said to be unprecedented in the history of international relations and is completely contrary to the provisions of international law. According to this law, when a neutral country imports certain goods from a belligerent country for its own use, no one may prohibit it, regardless of which country the goods are manufactured in. Britain's ban on the export and transshipment of German goods also violates international law. Finally, the Soviet government believes that Britain's demand that all ships sailing from the ports of countries directly connected to Germany must sail to British and French ports for inspection, regardless of which country the goods on board are manufactured, is an arbitrary and autocratic act. Therefore, the Soviet Union hereby protests against the above-mentioned measures of Britain, and reserves the right to demand compensation when Soviet state-owned ships are forced to sail to British and French ports, resulting in losses, or when Soviet foreign trade suffers losses due to Britain's implementation of the November 28 order.

<p>The Hague, Netherlands - The Japanese cargo ship Sanyou Maru (8,000 tons) carrying a batch of German goods was originally scheduled to depart from the Port of Rotterdam on the 9th of this month, pass through the blockade line of the British and French coasts, and sail back to its home country. Until yesterday, a telegram suddenly came from Tokyo, postponing the departure to the 13th of this month. The reason for this is still unknown, but the German side advocates that all neutral countries deal with Britain and France with a "positive neutral attitude," and urgently hopes that Japan will unite with other neutral countries to form an armed group, and hopes that the Sanyou Maru will set sail quickly and try to break through the blockade line of the British and French navies. (Eleventh dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>London - According to news received here today, what the Japanese steamship Sanyou Maru loaded when it left the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands was entirely German munitions. According to the prediction of the shipping industry here, the Sanyou Maru will probably arrive at Downs, the British inspection base, today. It is unknown whether the British government intends to confiscate these German goods. According to news here, the British Economic Warfare Department has conducted a preliminary investigation of the Sanyou Maru. (Eleventh dispatch from the Associated Press)</p>
<h3>Significant Losses for German Submarines; Construction Can't Keep Up; More British Ships Sunk; Germany Claims Mine Warfare is Legal</h3>
<p>London: According to informed sources in London, the current loss rate of German submarines is two to four per week. Although Germany is rushing to build submarines, it may not be able to quickly replenish them. It is impossible to know the exact number of submarines Germany is currently producing or will produce in the future. However, according to German general reports, one submarine was built per day in 1917, and this could be increased. However, according to statistics obtained by the London authorities, the average entry rate of German submarines in 1917 was seven per month, with a maximum of thirteen per month. It is highly questionable whether this number can be achieved now, due to the lack of raw materials, the scarcity of skilled labor, and the large number of workers serving in the military. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>London: Well-informed sources recently stated that British warships and aircraft destroyed at least five German submarines last week, exceeding the official estimate of two to four per week. According to German newspapers, the number of submarines built in that country actually exceeds the number lost. It was said that one submarine could be built per day in 1917, and even more can be built now. However, according to information obtained by the British naval authorities, the facts are not entirely true. Germany could only build four to twelve submarines per month in 1917, with the highest number built in October of that year being only thirteen. As far as the current situation is concerned, due to the lack of raw materials, its construction capacity is even lower than in 1917. Even in terms of the country's overall naval strength, it is smaller than it was in 1917. As such, the major losses suffered by the country in naval warfare are unlikely to be replenished. In other words, the threat of the country's submarine warfare will inevitably become a spent force. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<p>London: The Belgian ship "Kapinda," with a deadweight of 5,000 tons, which sailed from Pernambuco, Brazil, back to Antwerp, Belgium, ran aground off the southeast coast of England on the 8th of this month. The ship's keel has now broken, and it is considered a total loss. The 40 crew members and 50 dockworkers who were unloading cargo were all rescued and were not injured. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>London: In the week ending December 9th, seven British ships totaling 33,518 tons were sunk. Eight neutral ships totaling 26.61 tons were also sunk. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>London: Sir John Ambrose Fleming, a British radio expert who has made many inventions in broadcasting, has recently invented a new method of radio transmission and reception, which uses electric light to transmit signals. Anyone who purchases a specially made device can send and receive messages at any time. At sea, ships can communicate with each other or with land not far away, without the risk of leakage. This new invention has been submitted to the Admiralty for inspection. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German expert Professor Hats recently published an article in the Berliner Tageblatt discussing Germany's mine warfare against Britain under international law. He stated that Germany's engagement in naval warfare has been criticized for not restricting the scope of the war, especially mine warfare, which does not rely on military targets and does not comply with international law, thus threatening merchant ships. However, in this commercial war, Britain has adopted an escort system, placing ships traveling to and from Britain under military surveillance and military control of port trade, making it impossible to determine which are purely military in nature. Therefore, Germany's engagement in mine warfare cannot distinguish between commercial routes and warship routes. The provisions of the 1907 Hague Convention on mines only require notification of the location of mine obstacles to the extent that it is militarily feasible, and this provision cannot be decided by Britain, but must be deemed appropriate by Germany before the location of mine obstacles can be announced. If British merchant ships continue to fly their national flag at sea according to peacetime practice, Germany is willing to fulfill this provision. Conversely, if the British coast engages in military activities, others can only respond with military countermeasures. Furthermore, the Hague Convention clearly stipulates that belligerents may not place mines on the coast of the enemy country, unless the enemy country engages in obstructing peaceful commercial traffic, in which case it may do so. The military measures taken by Germany are purely to deal with an enemy country that is armed in many ways. (Haitong, 11th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Business Community Urges Negotiations with the U.S.; Hopes to Renew Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma stated today that Japanese business and industry leaders have suggested that the government make its best efforts to conclude a new commercial treaty with the United States, or to extend the treaty expiring in mid-January. Suma, who had just arrived here from Osaka and Kobe, said that his remarks could represent the Japanese business and industry community's anxiety regarding the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty. Suma also stated that Foreign Minister Nomura had inquired of the Soviet Ambassador on November 28 regarding the prompt negotiation of the Japan-Soviet fisheries issue. The Soviet Embassy has not yet replied. Suma said, "I hope this matter can be resolved satisfactorily. I do not wish to express my opinion on this matter, because the reason for the Soviet Union's delay in replying is unknown." (United Press, 11th)</p>
<h3>Chita Conference Determines Work Procedure</h3>
<p>Moscow: The second meeting of the Mongolia-"Manchukuo" Boundary Survey Mixed Committee was held at 11:00 a.m. on December 9 in Chita. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Kubota, the representative from the Japan-"Manchukuo" side. The meeting lasted seven hours. After discussing and determining the work procedure of the committee, it was adjourned at 6:00 p.m. The next meeting is scheduled to be held on the 11th. (Tass, 11th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Among the pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union, the issue of North Pacific fisheries has become urgent because the current temporary treaty revision period expires at the end of this year. Therefore, Foreign Minister Nomura invited Soviet Ambassador to Japan Smetanin to the Foreign Ministry on November 15th (last month) to propose that Japan and the Soviet Union should promptly begin discussing the fisheries issue. He met with Ambassador Smetanin again on the 28th, urging him to begin negotiations. At that time, Ambassador Smetanin replied that he had not received instructions from his government and therefore could not conduct negotiations, but that he was willing to urge his government to send instructions as soon as possible. However, two weeks have passed and the Soviet side has not yet expressed its willingness to negotiate concretely. On the other hand, Ambassador Togo in Moscow has repeatedly proposed to Foreign Minister Molotov that fisheries talks should begin in Tokyo as soon as possible, but has not received a satisfactory reply. Therefore, Japanese public opinion has gradually become stronger, believing that if the Soviet side continues with this insincere attitude, Japan will have no choice but to take decisive measures to ensure its rights and interests in the North Pacific. Relevant government departments are also preparing to begin discussing countermeasures to deal with this issue in the near future. (Domei, 11th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Offensive Obstructed; Fierce Fighting in Northern Finland; Soviet Union Intensifies Attacks on Narrowest Area; Finnish Batteries Return Fire on Soviet Warships</h3>
<p>Helsinki: A communiqué issued here today stated that the Soviet forces continuing their offensive in the Taipale River area have been repelled. Fierce battles are underway in several locations on the eastern border, except for the Petsamo area along the Arctic coast. Several batteries on the islands opposite Koivisto in the Gulf of Finland were bombed by Soviet aircraft. Finnish Air Force bombed a column of advancing Soviet troops, and with the help of field artillery, destroyed a team of tanks and armored vehicles. However, the Soviet communiqué issued in Moscow stated that Soviet forces have advanced three to four miles along all war zones, and have occupied the town of Korojärvi in the Ukhta area and the towns of Poposino and Kirkkomalm in the Karelian Isthmus. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Moscow: The Leningrad Military District Headquarters issued the following war report: On December 10, Soviet forces advanced 5 to 7 kilometers on all fronts. In the Ukhta area, Soviet forces occupied the town of Korojärvi; in the Polosozelo area, they occupied the village of Johonnara; and in the Karelian Isthmus, they occupied the towns of Bebaosino and Koukamoula. The Air Force only conducted reconnaissance activities due to poor weather. (Tass, 11th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: According to recent front-line reports, Finnish troops are still holding positions at key points. Soviet forces are currently intensifying their attacks on Suomussalmi, which is known as the narrowest area of Finland. It is observed that the Soviet goal is to cut off the Gulf of Bothnia and split Finland in two. Finland has adopted various precautionary plans to prevent the Soviet forces from advancing in this direction. The Soviet side is still transferring reinforcements to the Karelian Isthmus. It is reported that the Soviet vanguard is now about thirty miles from Vyborg. It is rumored that Soviet troops there are still using poison gas. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The Finnish General Headquarters recently issued a war report stating that the enemy attacked in the Taipale River area (near the Karelian Isthmus) yesterday, the 9th of this month, and was repelled. Their offensive in the east was also contained, but they have a greater advantage in the northern Petsamo port area. Soviet warships have also shelled military locations along the coast, and our batteries have often returned fire. In addition, Soviet Air Force planes dropped bombs on the fortresses of Hanko Island and  Uukos Island, but with little effect. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: According to Finnish official sources, Soviet troops attempted to advance along the right bank of the Vuoksi River, but were repelled by Finnish troops. The Soviet Air Force took advantage of clear weather on Saturday to bomb the Koivisto defense area, 27 miles southeast of Vyborg, and Hanko, but there were no reports of damage. The Soviet fleet also shelled areas near the islands. According to news from Kagnas, in the northern Finnish front line, Soviet deaths have reached 9,000. It is said that the Soviet troops advanced too quickly, resulting in insufficient supplies. Last weekend, Soviet troops advanced in several places, entering Finnish territory for up to 30 miles. Soviet troops are currently experiencing food shortages in several places, unable to obtain supplies. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Finnish Side Denies Claim that Finnish Defense Line Has Been Breached</p>
<p>Helsinki: A rumor that the Finnish defense line has been breached by Soviet troops has recently been denied by responsible sources here, who stated that Finnish troops are fighting bravely on the front line, especially in the north, where the fighting is exceptionally fierce. In addition, Soviet troops began crossing the Petsamo River the day before yesterday evening, and will launch a fierce offensive after a large number of reinforcements arrive. Finnish troops are now holding positions on the left bank of the Petsamo River. The heavy losses suffered by Soviet troops in repeated attacks have been confirmed by all parties. The number of officers and soldiers killed has reached more than 4,000, and the number of prisoners is even greater. Five of their tanks have been destroyed by Finnish anti-tank guns in the Karelian Isthmus. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<p>Bern: According to news from the Finnish capital, Soviet troops are about to launch a large-scale offensive from the town of Ukhta toward Oulu, a city on the northern side of the Gulf of Bothnia, in an attempt to cut off traffic between Finland and Sweden. Finland has mobilized a batch of reservists in order to strengthen its defenses. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>German Side Claims No Military Supplies Shipped to Finland</p>
<p>Berlin: Responsible authorities here stated that since the start of the Soviet-Finnish conflict, no military supplies have been shipped from Germany or through Germany to Finland. Rumors that German military supplies have been shipped to Finland or that Germany has allowed Italian aircraft to fly to Finland via Germany are not true. (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<p>Soviet Aircraft Bomb Hokilab, Finland</p>
<p>Oslo: Soviet aircraft bombed the town of Hokilab, Finland (near the Norwegian border) today, but most of the bombs fell in the middle of the forest, causing minimal damage. According to Finnish sources, the Soviet Red Army has attacked the ports of Petsamo and Salmi twice, but has not succeeded. They have suffered heavy losses, with as many as 500 officers and soldiers killed and 200 captured. Conversely, Finnish troops have suffered little loss and their morale is high. Because Finnish soldiers are mostly skilled skiers, they have been able to win surprisingly and very successfully. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Finnish Troops Holding Extremely Solid Positions</p>
<p>(Karelian Front Line) Finnish troops in the western Karelian region, 50 kilometers from Vyborg, are currently holding extremely solid positions. The terrain is absolutely favorable to the Finnish troops. Therefore, the Finnish military mostly believes that there is no need to retreat to the Mannerheim Line, and that they can hold off the Soviet Red Army through the winter. If the Soviet Red Army advances further, the Finnish military can at any time and place, at a favorable time and terrain, inflict a major blow on the Soviet Red Army. According to today's war news from northern Finland, the Soviet Red Army has begun a fierce offensive in the Samoyed area. At the same time, in the Petsamo area, from 11:00 this morning to 1:00 this afternoon, Soviet aircraft carried out a large-scale bombing. Even in the Norwegian border area, the sound of bombing could be heard, as well as the sound of machine guns and anti-aircraft guns. Although northern Finland is extremely cold today, the weather has cleared up. According to refugees who have fled from northern Finland, Finnish patrols, although small in number, often inflict major blows on large Soviet units. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Finnish Minister to Soviet Union Discusses Circumstances of Soviet-Finnish Diplomatic Break</p>
<p>Copenhagen: After Finnish Minister to the Soviet Union, Mr. Koskinen, left for home, he told a reporter from the Political News stationed in Helsinki yesterday that the last proposal submitted by our government to the Soviet Union had already made the utmost concessions, even agreeing to withdraw troops from the Karelien Isthmus. However, the Soviet authorities deliberately delayed the transmission of all documents, so that this proposal did not reach the Soviet government, which then declared the severance of diplomatic relations with our country. Since the outbreak of the war, the Soviet people have been greatly shaken, and the Soviet authorities are particularly surprised by the slowness of the Red Army's advance. In fact, this Red Army has been reorganized once, and many of its original excellent officers have been executed, resulting in a significant weakening of its strength. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Government Loan to Finland - U.S. $10 Million</h3>
<p>Washington: Mr. Jones, Director of the Federal Loan Agency, stated that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the Federal Export-Import Bank have been authorized by the President to grant a $10 million line of credit to the "Finnish American Trading Corporation" for the purchase of "surplus agricultural products and non-military supplies" from the United States. The company was formed by Mr. Procope, the Finnish Minister to the United States, and has been registered in the United States with a capital of $1 million, guaranteed by the Finnish National Bank or the Finnish government. In addition, the United States plans to grant a line of credit to Norway. Ambassador Procope also stated that the Finnish American Trading Corporation has now been established and will begin operations within a few days. It is not yet known what goods will be purchased from the United States, but it can be said with certainty that the $10 million loan will be fully used. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<h3>The 20th League of Nations Assembly Opens; Thirteen Member States Absent; Committee Formed to Consider Finnish Appeal</h3>
<p>Geneva – At the opening of today's League of Nations Assembly, thirteen of the fifty-three member states were absent. The Chairman announced plans to expedite all meeting procedures so that representatives could return to their countries early. Norwegian representative Hambro has been elected as Chairman of the Assembly, with British Butler, Belgian Wiaux, Canadian Lang, Egyptian Fakry, French Poncet, Greek Politis, Romanian Ronidetes, Portuguese Motta, and Swiss Rappard as Vice-Chairmen. These individuals will form a committee to first consider Finland's appeal. In his speech, Chairman Hambro stated that our gathering is to prevent acts of war between member nations and to protect threatened civilization. The Assembly then adjourned and reconvened in the afternoon. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Geneva – The 20th League of Nations Assembly opened at 11:30 AM this month. Representatives from forty nations attended, including Poland. The representatives from Afghanistan, Albania, Chile, Panama, and Peru were all absent. The Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Sakolin (Soviet), also occupied a seat on the staff. After the meeting opened, the interim Chairman, Belgian representative Carton de Wiart, delivered a brief speech, stating that the Assembly would discuss a few issues on the agenda, including the application submitted by the Finnish government. However, the shorter the session, the better, and the procedures adopted by the Assembly should be as simple as possible. The Assembly then elected a nine-member committee to review the credentials of the representatives from the participating countries. After the review was completed, the Assembly continued to meet, and the Election Committee proposed the election of Norwegian representative, Hambro, Speaker of the Norwegian Parliament, as the official Chairman of the Assembly, with representatives from Belgium, Britain, Canada, Egypt, France, Greece, Portugal, and Switzerland as Vice-Chairmen. The Assembly immediately approved the proposal. Thereupon, the interim Chairman Carton de Wiart delivered a speech, welcoming the new Chairman, and saying, "The League of Nations has never encountered such dark circumstances as today. But in the future, it may regain its light and strength, and perhaps even be better adapted to all possibilities in international life. As for the present, we can only maintain the League of Nations' activities in technical areas." The newly appointed Chairman Hambro then delivered a speech, stating that a member state, threatened by another member state, had submitted an application to the League of Nations and was bravely defending itself. The Assembly would discuss this application. At this critical juncture, we must take action so that small nations fighting for their independence do not feel disappointed. It is hoped that this Assembly can be the starting point for renewed mutual assistance and solidarity among the peace-loving nations of the world. The Assembly then adjourned at 12:45 PM and decided to reconvene at 4:30 PM. The Presidium was scheduled to meet at 4:00 PM beforehand. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Geneva – According to reliable sources, China will prevent the League of Nations from expelling the Soviet Union. It has notified the British and French delegations that China will not participate in the League of Nations Council meeting scheduled for 11:00 AM today. China's refusal to participate in the League of Nations Council meeting is a mechanical obstruction of Argentina's proposal to expel the Soviet Union from the League of Nations, as such a measure requires unanimous agreement from the Administrative Council. The head of the British delegation, Butler, told a reporter from the Associated Press yesterday that while Britain and France agreed to expel the Soviet Union, "technical difficulties" made a unanimous vote impossible. It is generally assumed that Butler's statement refers to China's refusal to participate in the Administrative Council meeting. The head of the Chinese delegation, Gu Weijun, remained tight-lipped last night about China's attitude towards Argentina's proposal. The Soviet representatives, staying in a hotel, refused to see anyone except German reporters. Italy formally withdrew from the League of Nations yesterday because the two-year notice period for withdrawal had expired. Nevertheless, since the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish War, Italy's interest in observing the League of Nations has increased significantly. German and Japanese activities in Geneva are particularly vigorous. German reporters have requested permission to attend the League of Nations Assembly as observers, and some have been granted permission. Japanese activities in Geneva are being led by the Japan International Conference Bureau. (Associated Press, 11th)</p>
<p>London – British government officials stated that the League of Nations Assembly, meeting today, will be able to decide how to assist Finland, but will not impose any sanctions on the Soviet Union, nor will it declare the Soviet Union expelled from the League. Currently, the League of Nations is focused on whether the Soviet Union will further threaten Sweden. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Buenos Aires – Argentine Foreign Minister Cantilo stated yesterday that the external world regards Argentina's intention to withdraw from the League of Nations as a statement that if the League of Nations does not implement sanctions against the Soviet Union, Argentina will announce its withdrawal from the League. This is a purely inaccurate interpretation. The matter of Argentina's withdrawal from the League of Nations has not yet reached a decision stage. However, if the League of Nations' attitude towards the Soviet Union is not in line with Argentina's sanction stance, then measures to withdraw from the League of Nations will be considered. The rumor that Argentina is requesting to be a member of the League of Nations Administrative Council is not accurate, and the Foreign Ministry has already instructed the Argentine representative in Geneva not to accept it.

<h3>Finnish Parliament Issues Two Declarations; Appeals to All Countries for Active Assistance; Encourages the People to Concentrate Strength and Will</h3>
<p>Helsinki – The Finnish Parliament has issued two declarations, one to the countries of the world and the other to the nation, with the main contents as follows: (1) The declaration to the countries of the world states, "Our people have always wanted to maintain friendly relations with other countries and have been committed to peaceful work. But at this moment, we have been forced to fight for our country's independence, freedom, and honor, which is deeply regrettable. What we want to defend is not limited to our religion and our motherland, but also includes all things considered sacred by civilized countries. Since the enemy invaded our country, we have resisted alone, hoping to preserve the most precious things of mankind. We will go all out, believing that our position is the outpost of Western civilization, and that civilized countries around the world will sympathize with our plight and actively assist us, and will not allow us to fight alone against a much stronger enemy. With this understanding, we appeal to all civilized countries in the world." (2) The declaration to the nation states, "Now a great power is trying to destroy our country and has launched an aggressive war against us. Fortunately, our soldiers throughout the country have risen up to resist and defend the freedom of the motherland. In recent days, their bravery in combat and the strength of their power have been fully demonstrated. All our soldiers are confident that we will win. The Parliament hereby represents the people of the country and expresses its sincere admiration for the spirit shown by the loyal and courageous soldiers on the front line.

<p>London – The Times commented today on the Soviet-Finnish dispute in the League of Nations Assembly, stating that the most reasonable ideal path is for member states to decide to unite and resist with force when any one of them is attacked by the Soviet Union, Germany, or other countries. If this were the case, the current war could be quickly ended. It is a pity that this ideal may not be realized. The newspaper then listed the various difficulties that smaller countries have regarding this matter, and stated that Britain and France have always been extremely concerned about the survival of smaller countries, and have joined the war because of this. The guarantee of the safety of smaller countries should not be the responsibility of others. However, Britain and France have now assumed such a major responsibility. If they want to disperse their concentrated strength, so as to affect major military plans, it is clearly unwise. It would be even more foolish to fight with countries stretching from the Baltic Sea to the White Sea. Therefore, the current way to help Finland, apart from actually joining the war, has many aspects. Finland's bravery in combat has been clearly seen by everyone. If Britain and France provide them with a small portion of resources, they can achieve air superiority, and the result may even be to defeat a strong enemy. If you want to help Finland, now is the time. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<h3>Germany and Romania Conduct Economic Talks</h3>

Once the two sides have reached agreement on various important issues, the chief representative of the delegation, Clodius, will return to Berlin to report everything. The largest demand from the German side is to revise the exchange rate between the Mark and the Romanian currency, that is, to raise it from the current exchange rate of 41.5 lei per Mark to 60 lei. The Romanian government is firmly opposed to this. Whether the two sides have reached a compromise is unknown, but it is generally believed that the exchange rate can be set at around 50 lei per Mark, thereby reaching a compromise. In addition, Germany wants to purchase a large amount of wheat from Romania and pay for the goods with manufactured goods, but these manufactured goods must be delivered six months to a year later. It is said that this has not yet been agreed to by the Romanian government. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle at the Fujian Border Watershed: Wu Qiwai Pacifies Southern Fujian</h3>
<p>Shantou Dispatch, early October: Many puppet troops were transported from Shanghai, Taiwan, and other places to Shantou and stationed in Chenghai, Chao'an, Anbu, and other places. Later, they were assigned by the Japanese army to Huang Dawei and formed into the puppet "Peace and National Salvation Army." In mid-November, Huang led his ugly gang to disturb southern Fujian and renamed it the puppet "Nation-Building Pacification Army," forming the First and Seventh Armies. Huang concurrently served as the puppet First Army Commander, and Wang Tiancai served as the puppet Seventh Army Commander. On the 27th, they concentrated in Chengcheng and advanced towards Zhanglin, Donglong, and Huanggang. On the night of the 28th, Huang's troops camped in Zhanglin. It was reported that they had four or five steel cannons and eight or nine mortars. Platoon leaders and above carried short guns and hand grenades. Soldiers were equipped with six-person, 7.9mm rifles and had red, yellow, blue, white, and black five-color cloth badges wrapped around their arms. Those staying in Lianyang City, Chengcheng, had yellow circular Taiji-shaped symbols. Half of them were unarmed strong laborers, reportedly newly arrested youths from various places. The troops advancing towards the watershed via Huanggang this time numbered no more than three thousand, with seven or eight hundred Japanese soldiers. Wherever they went, they widely distributed leaflets and proclamations specifically targeting the people of southern Fujian and the families of overseas Chinese, talking about how to reorganize Fujian into a "kingdom of righteousness and paradise," with rhetoric just like the Japanese propaganda outline. On the 30th, a fierce battle broke out with the Chinese army at the foot of the watershed. The Japanese and puppet troops, guided by pirates and bandits, advanced from the side of Zhalin Dachen, using two or thirty iron barges and motorboats to land directly at Niuxin Stone in Zhalin. They bypassed the watershed pass from the side of Dajian You. On the 1st of this month, they sneaked into Zhao'an territory and fought with the Shen surname's strong laborers. Six Japanese aircraft covered one thousand Japanese and puppet troops in Huanggang, who attacked the watershed from the front. The Guanyin Temple and ancient artillery fort on the ridge were bombed to the ground. No more than five hundred Japanese and puppet troops entered Zhao'an territory. Wu Qiwai's Chinese army also rushed from Raoping and divided into three routes to intercept them from the seaside. Wang Tiancai's puppet troops in Zhanglin were defeated by Li Shaoru's troops on the 1st and retreated to Lianyang. Japanese troops on the Raoping-Qian road line at Fushan Xiaodong also retreated to Jingzhou at the same time. Huanggang was recaptured by the Chinese army on the night of the 1st. The Japanese and puppet troops retreated again to Zhalin Dachen, which is very close to the coast, and Japanese warships provided artillery cover. Japanese aircraft took turns bombing the mountains on the Fujian-Guangdong border. A great bloody battle is now taking place on the watershed mountain on the Fujian border. The Japanese and puppet troops suffered a rapid waist-cut by the Chinese army this time, with more than one thousand killed or wounded.</p>
<p>Currently, in the mountains of southern Fujian, traitors are active, and rumors are rampant. Wu Qiwai, the Pacification Commissioner of the Guangdong-Jiangxi-Fujian tri-province border area, specially dispatched Chief of Staff Tu Sizong to Longyan, then to Pinghe to set up an office, and posted ten wartime prohibitions in various counties, cities, and towns: 1. Those who illegally organize and impersonate resistance and rescue groups or local self-government will be sentenced to death. 2. Those who cleverly set up names, privately establish checkpoints, and collect transit fees or protection fees for passengers and goods will be sentenced to death. 3. Those who supply bandits with guns and ammunition, harbor smugglers, or secretly organize armed teams will be sentenced to death. 4. Those who harbor bandits, harbor people of unknown origin, or divide the spoils while sitting on the ground will be sentenced to death. 5. Those who provide bandits with rice and salt or secretly hide and sell various stolen goods will be sentenced to death. 6. Those who destroy transportation, communication, or affect anti-Japanese transportation will be sentenced to death. 7. Those who use counterfeit currency or disrupt the financial system will be sentenced to death. 8. Those who abuse their power to detain innocent people or seize property will be sentenced to death. 9. Those who collect reactionary publications and leaflets, spread rumors, or secretly communicate with the enemy as spies will be sentenced to death. The above strict penalties are all aimed at the current situation to suppress reactionaries. The disturbed areas are only within ten miles of the coast, and the power of traitors cannot penetrate the interior.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Jiaxing Once Attacked He City, Japanese Army Forced Civilians to Be Puppet Troops</h3>
<p>Jiaxing Dispatch: The strength of the Chinese army in the Jiaxing area has become quite strong after being reorganized by the military authorities. Fierce battles have repeatedly occurred in Xincheng, Tongxiang, Puyuan, and other places in the suburbs of He over the past half month, and the Japanese army has been defeated in disarray each time. The Chinese army once launched a fierce attack on He City, but failed to capture the city walls due to the fierce Japanese artillery fire. The Japanese army is now not only actively building artillery positions in the Gao surname's foreign-style house in the South Gate and arranging defensive works in the Zha Yan and Baibuting areas in the North Gate, but also forcibly pulling civilians to serve as puppet troops. Therefore, the residents of He are all panicking, and the market is extremely depressed. The puppet chamber of commerce witnessed this situation and held a meeting to discuss solutions. It was decided that each store in the city would hire 300 laborers to be puppet troops, and all expenses would be borne by the stores and residents.</p>
<h3>Japanese Officers Return in Silence, Officers' Wives Hold Corpse Ashes Waiting for the Train: The Tragic Situation is Inhuman</h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: A foreigner who traveled from Jin and Sui back to Ping talked about how, due to the active guerrilla warfare of the Chinese army in Jinzhong, the express train on the Ping-Sui Railway now has a "compartment for the remains of Japanese soldiers" attached every day, carrying the ashes of officers and soldiers killed in battle back to their country. Some officers' wives, dressed in mourning clothes and with tears in their eyes, held the wooden box containing the ashes of their deceased husbands in their hands, standing alone at the station in the desolate desert wind. The tragic situation was truly inhuman.</p>

<h3>Chinese and Japanese Armies in the Xuzhou Area Constantly Engage in Fierce Battles, Chinese Army Achieves Victory in Tongshan, Pei County, and Dangshan Counties</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: The Japanese army in Xuzhou has been repeatedly attacked by the Chinese army, and its railways have been damaged, so it has recently been extremely strict in its defenses. In November, the Japanese army launched a large-scale invasion of eastern Xuzhou, which was repeatedly resisted by Tongshan County Magistrate Guo. It is estimated that on November 17th, County Magistrate Guo led the First and Third Battalions and joined forces with the Budong Liang troops, totaling more than 2,000 people, intending to destroy the Longhai Road and the Tai-Zhao Road. When they arrived at La Fu Mountain on the side of the Tai-Zhao Road, they wanted to join forces with the Picheng Garrison Team to destroy the Tai-Zhao branch road. That night, they ordered the villages to gather laborers to prepare to start work. Unexpectedly, that night, the Japanese in Taierzhuang increased to more than 400, with eight tanks and more than 60 cavalry, and occupied the canal lock in advance. In order to facilitate combat, County Magistrate Guo moved his troops east, with one unit crossing the canal to occupy Yushantou, and the Liang unit stationed west of the canal at Wangmu Mountain to provide support. The next day, the Japanese army indeed moved out in both east and west directions, but did not dare to invade south. County Magistrate Guo then went to Pi County to negotiate with County Magistrate Wang on the matter of thoroughly destroying the Tai-Zhao Road. That night, they also learned that the Japanese army had suddenly increased by more than 100, and the next day, they moved west to coordinate with the Japanese army in Taierzhuang, encircling and attacking the Chinese army. County Magistrate Guo immediately led his troops back to the Heishan area north of Jitang that night and temporarily avoided their advance. At dawn on the 19th, the Japanese army from Taisu and Jisan launched a large-scale attack, searching all the villages. The residences of Guo District Chief, Du Assistant, and Li Battalion Adjutant were all burned and looted. That night, the Japanese army occupied Daxiao Wujia West Village and did not retreat. On the 20th, they continued to attack. Guo then led his troops south across the road that night, temporarily residing in the area and convening a meeting of major battalion commanders to discuss plans to deal with the current large-scale invasion by the Japanese army. The war in eastern Xuzhou has temporarily come to a halt.</p>
<p>Although Pei County City was occupied by the Japanese army, a vast area is still controlled by the Chinese army. The Japanese army has repeatedly tried to mop up, but has failed to succeed. At 8:00 AM on November 19th, more than 80 Japanese soldiers and more than 60 puppet troops in Pei City, along with more than 40 Japanese and puppet troops in Dazhangzhai, took four armored vehicles, two mortars, and several light and heavy machine guns to attack the Menglou area in southern Pei. County Magistrate Feng dispatched the department’s branch captain Zhang Kaiyue and the county general team’s battalion commander Wei Ruizhai to lead the team to resist, encircling and suppressing the enemy on three routes and launching a fierce battle. After four hours, the Japanese and puppet troops suffered heavy losses and all retreated to Menglou Village to resist stubbornly. The Chinese army immediately pressed forward and fiercely encircled and suppressed the enemy. The Japanese and puppet troops were extremely panicked and rushed back to Pei City and Dazhangzhai in cars, carrying more than 80 reinforcements and one heavy artillery to launch another fierce battle. At 4:00 PM, the Japanese and puppet troops were unable to resist and fled in a panic to Zhangzhai. The Chinese army continued to bravely pursue. In this battle, more than ten Japanese and puppet troops were killed and more than thirty were wounded. Three Japanese soldiers’ corpses were left behind, and the Chinese army seized one rifle, one puppet army armband, and many other military supplies. The Chinese army officers and soldiers suffered slight casualties, and company commander Hu Jinlong also suffered glorious injuries.</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Dangshan has been in constant contact with the Chinese army in the past month. County Magistrate Dou Ruishan has engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army five or six times, especially in the three battles of Chenlou, Xiejihu, and Hutun. It is estimated that more than 80 Japanese soldiers were killed, including one captain and three squad leaders, and more than 30 Japanese soldiers were wounded. The Chinese side only had seven killed and more than ten wounded. Wang, the director of the Xuhai Administrative Office, commended the county magistrate for repeatedly inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army and has sent a telegram to commend him.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Overview of This Year's University Unified Entrance Examination (II): Summary by Section Chief Huang Longxian of the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>(2) Participating Institutions</p>
<p>In addition to all national colleges and universities being included in this year's unified examination, there are also two provincial universities that are being recruited on behalf of, totaling 28 units, 77 colleges, and 301 departments (including three vocational courses). The complexity of the work can be imagined. This year also has two characteristics, namely (1) All national universities and independent colleges are included in the scope of recruitment. Last year, due to environmental reasons, Shanghai colleges and universities recruited on their own. After they were recruited by Shanghai colleges and universities on behalf of the national colleges and universities in the rear, they were assigned to major universities in the rear to study. Although the situation in Shanghai is still difficult this year, a recruitment committee has been organized to conduct recruitment work. This is commendable. However, the environment in Shanghai is still special. Students taking the exam in the inland areas are still not allowed to choose Shanghai schools as their preferred schools. (2) Provincial universities have also joined the unified examination this year. Although Guangxi and Chongqing Universities were also included last year, this year even Henan University, which is far away in western Henan and inconvenient to reach, has joined. Except for provincial independent colleges, all public colleges and universities have completely joined. From these two points of view, it can be seen that the effectiveness of the unified examination has been widely applied to public colleges and universities. The number of colleges and departments included in the unified examination has gradually increased due to the increase in the number of schools. However, the colleges and departments listed this year do not include vocational courses. The reason is that vocational courses are inherently vocational in nature, and the examination subjects of vocational courses such as art are inherently different, and the admission standards are not suitable for being combined with other colleges and departments. Although the situation of physical education vocational courses is similar, the Boy Scout and Physical Education Vocational Courses set up by Central China University and National Teachers College and the Physical Education Vocational Courses of National Chongqing University are still included this year for the sake of saving time and effort. However, the admission standards are different from other colleges and departments.</p>
<p>(3) Examination Subjects</p>
<p>The examination subjects are the essence of the examination. How is the student's level? Is the exam valuable? Examination subjects are the most important factor. Too few subjects do not reveal the student's level well, and too many subjects are overwhelming for the student and unnecessary. The subjects of the unified examination are undoubtedly based on secondary school subjects. However, in the past, each school recruited on its own, and the subjects were inconsistent, so the entrance levels were also extremely uneven. The subjects of the unified examination were determined after long and careful consideration. They are roughly divided into two categories: written examination and oral examination. The oral examination is only used for those who apply to teachers colleges. The written examination is divided into three groups: The first group is for departments of liberal arts, law, and commerce, and for education, civics, physical education, Chinese, English, history and geography, and home economics departments of teachers colleges, and the railway management department of engineering colleges. The second group is for departments of engineering colleges, mathematics, physics, chemistry, astronomy, meteorology, and civil engineering departments of science colleges, and mathematics and science departments of teachers colleges. The third group is for departments of medical colleges and agricultural colleges, biology, geography, geology departments of science colleges, and botany departments of teachers colleges. The required subjects for the three groups are all seven. Four of them are completely the same, namely civics, Chinese, English (those applying to Tongji and Sun Yat-sen University Medical College take German), and national history and geography. Mathematics is also included in all three groups, but the difficulty and depth are different. The first group's mathematics includes algebra, plane geometry, and trigonometry. The second group's mathematics A includes higher algebra, analytic geometry, and trigonometry. The third group's mathematics B includes higher algebra, plane geometry, and trigonometry. The other two required subjects that are different for the three groups are foreign history and geography and one of physics, chemistry, or biology for the first group, physics and chemistry for the second group, and biology (those applying for geography take foreign history and geography) and one of physics or chemistry for the third group. In addition, those applying for physical education departments must also take a practical subject test. In addition, the examination subjects are closely related to the candidate's preferences. For example, those who choose Group 2 as their first preference and Group 3 as their second and third preferences must take biology or foreign history and geography, and those who also choose Tongji or Sun Yat-sen University Medical College must take German. Those who choose the above two colleges and universities as their first preference and other schools as their second or third preference must take English. However, the student's preferences are subject to group restrictions. Those who choose the Group 1 colleges and departments as their first preference can only choose other colleges and departments in this group as their second and third preferences. Those who choose the Group 2 colleges and departments as their second preference can choose the colleges and departments in this group and Group 3 as their other preferences, but may not choose any departments in Group 1 as their other preferences. Those who choose the Group 3 colleges and departments as their first preference can only choose other colleges and departments in this group as their other preferences, but may not choose any departments in Group 1 or Group 2 as their other preferences. However, geography departments may also choose the colleges and departments in Group 1 as their other preferences.</p>
<p>(4) Distribution of Test Papers</p>
<p>The problem of test papers is one of the most important things in the examination. The biggest success of this year's unified examination is that the unified test papers have been handled. Originally, in this extraordinary period, when transportation is so difficult, the unified test papers were actually able to be delivered to all test areas before the exam period. It is truly the most satisfying thing. The test papers for the unified examination were selected from several sets of questions in a very meticulous manner. Although there are inevitable places where the difficulty is uneven, it cannot be overstated for the sake of raising the level of students. Moreover, from an academic point of view, the test questions should be difficult and easy. The standards for setting the questions were stipulated by the Ministry of Education in advance, which are (1) The scope and level of the question should be limited to the high school curriculum standards, and the content of the question should be based on the applicable textbooks approved for examination; (2) The number of test questions for each subject should be based on the general candidates' ability to complete the paper within the prescribed time (Chinese, mathematics, English, or German each 3 hours, and the remaining subjects each 2 hours). The test questions should stipulate that students answer all questions and not adopt any optional or selective methods, but the order of the questions can be changed by the students; (3) The Chinese test should include one essay (classical or vernacular), and each translation between classical and vernacular; (4) The English test should include one essay and each translation between English and Chinese (German should be similar); (5) The questions in each subject should not be vague or focus on memory; (6) The physics, chemistry, and biology questions must each have a question testing the experimental procedures. These regulations can be considered reasonable. After the test questions were drafted, they were reviewed by the Ministry of Education, secretly handed over to the chairman of the Unified Enrollment Committee for strict printing, and the Minister and Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education personally supervised the printing. After printing, the Ministry of Education sent a special commissioner to deliver the test papers to each enrollment area and hand them over to the chairman of each area for strict printing, sealing, and storage for use. The meticulousness of the procedures can be imagined. This year, the test papers were sent out in five routes due to traffic and time constraints: (1) Chengdu, Nanzheng, Zhenping, and Lanzhou areas; (2) Guiyang and Chenxi areas; (3) Kunming and Shanghai areas; (4) Guilin, Qujiang, Taihe, Yongkang, and Yanping areas; (5) Enshi area. For the sake of speed, most of them departed by plane. The special commissioner who delivered the questions to the last area must also be responsible for supervision. The Ministry of Education's emphasis on this matter is evident. In addition, in order to prevent air raids or leakage of test questions during the examination, each area may independently prepare a set of test questions for each subject for use in case of emergencies.</p>

<h3>Food: Authorities Crack Down on Manipulation; Rice and Grain Speculators Slightly Subdued; Market Prices Drop by One to Two Yuan; Foreign Rice Prices Arrive at Over 18,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Since rice prices soared, the livelihood of the common people has become extremely painful. Now that the concessions have strictly cracked down on speculative manipulation of the bean and rice industry association and implemented strict price limits, speculators and those engaged in speculation have disappeared, and rice prices have stabilized immediately. Although the inland supply yesterday still only had six or seven cars of goods arriving near the Sujia Road area, because manipulation was impossible, outsiders disappeared, and only general stores actually added a little bit of purchases. However, since sales were low, not only could they not rise again, but the general speculators, having lost their support, threw out their holdings, and the spot goods returned to the market, becoming abundant, supply exceeding demand, so they had to dump prices and compete for sales. The market was difficult to stand firm and went downstream step by step. Until the close of the market, if the prices of Japonica and Yinyuan had fallen by one or two yuan compared with the previous market, the regular Japonica had been limited to 45 yuan, and all other Japonica had entered the limit at around 40 yuan. However, the city's transactions were still very few. Looking at the overall trend, people's hearts have declined, and there may be a possibility of further decline.</p>
<p>Customer Indica rice has arrived in small quantities, and transactions in the market are mostly retail and less wholesale. However, the market is affected by the decline in Japonica rice, so people's hearts are also soft. Yesterday, the selling price of Jiangbei tip was 37.5 yuan to 37 yuan, and the selling price of Wuhu tip was 37.3 yuan to 36.8 yuan, a drop of 60 to 70 cents compared to the previous market.</p>
<p>Foreign rice is still priced high, so merchants have no intention of renewing their orders, and the road goods transactions have gradually turned quiet. Although some floating households are seeking to get rid of their holdings, the market decline is slower. A total of more than 1,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice were traded in the unified market, priced at 38 yuan to 37.5 yuan, slightly smaller than the previous market by 50 to 60 cents. It has been found that 18,000 bags have arrived in port.</p>
<h3>Supply Blocked; Wheat Sees New Prices Repeatedly; Afternoon High at 14 Yuan; Rice Prices High, Leading to Flour Price Increases</h3>
<p>The source of wheat yesterday and the day before was still sparse, because the goods arriving by car were blocked and not allowed to be directly transported into the concession, resulting in a scarce supply in the market. Holders, due to the high price of flour mills, sold at better prices. Even a small number of social engagements were sold at prices no less than 14 yuan. In the morning market, three cars of Kunshan wheat were traded at 13.7 yuan. In the afternoon, the market became more popular, and the manufacturers also released prices to buy, eating the plate to a new high price of 14 yuan. Fuxin handled 5,000 bags, and Fufeng handled 8,000 bags.</p>
<p>The flour mill plate rose another 10 cents yesterday, and the wholesale price of No. 2 flour has been changed to 8.4 yuan. This is because recent sales have improved significantly, all affected by the high price of rice. More common people are eating flour. If the rice price is 45 yuan, the flour price is still cheap. In addition, the price of wheat raw materials has repeatedly soared, so people's hearts are all upward, and the return goods are more popular. The green gun car stack list opened to 8.89 yuan, and its rising wind can also be seen. A total of about 40,000 bags were traded in the unified market. It was found that the trading of the Japanese factory's Phoenix brand flour in December continued to be lively, because it was emphasized by general speculators. The morning initially opened at 8.3 yuan, and soon returned to 20 to 45 cents. It is said that January also opened, priced at 8.65 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn Flowers: Profit-taking, Yarn Prices Fall Back</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had risen for three consecutive days, yesterday triggered profit-takers to take the opportunity to come out and fall back. At the same time, actual sales were not as strong as the previous day. Therefore, people's hearts were flat, but the overseas cotton market continued to advance, and some minds still tended to throw in. The market state was in a state of hesitation and could not actively rise. In terms of raw materials, the market is afraid that there will be no major decline.</p>
<p>The opening of the morning yarn market carried forward the enthusiastic popularity of the previous day and continued to advance. 20-count double horse once reached 742 yuan, rising 15 yuan from the previous day. Unexpectedly, as soon as the price was high, the profit-takers took advantage of the situation to file, and the market price quickly fell back, falling to 726 yuan. At the same time, customer sales were not strong, and the situation was still weak. Until the close, it was still ordinary. It was found that the statistics of transactions in half a day were 1,557 packages, and the market price of 20-count double horse rose by 1 yuan, Tiannv fell by 1 yuan, and Shuang Earth fell by 2 yuan. The amount of each gang purchased is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Active, Transactions Dominated by the Same Trade</h3>
<p>Cotton trading is still not weak, and is still dominated by the same trade transactions. The factory's needs have not been greatly developed, and only Shenxin Factory has made some embellishments. At present, some psychology holds a wait-and-see attitude, so the trend is a strong image, but the overseas cotton market is rising all the way, the situation is still good, and the source is limited, the cotton market base is very expensive, because there are few who are optimistic and continuously collect, but the rise is huge, profit-takers have a slight spit, the same situation as the yarn market. Therefore, yesterday's selling price was not much different from the previous day. The source of Subei, Tonghua 2,548 packages, Changyinsha 182 packages, Beisha Lai 2,750 packages, and the transaction situation is listed on the left.</p>

<p>Another news, the price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market has been particularly active in recent days, and all parties overseas are deeply afraid that the remaining export subsidy of 40 pounds will be cancelled, so their transactions are extremely enthusiastic, and the cotton price has been pulled up by them. At the same time, the same industry transactions are very large, and the shorts are very strong in offsetting. As a result, the closing price has risen by more than ten pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market is relatively quiet, and the market price has risen by three rupees along with the forecast. The Egyptian cotton market is particularly outstanding, and yesterday it rose by more than 100 pounds. Liverpool is closed.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading, all parties are deeply aware that the remaining export subsidy of 40 pounds will be cancelled, but because the current selling price is very high, they are unwilling to order, and intend to temporarily hold on to their views, the transaction is extremely quiet, but the general forecast of American cotton trading, will still be active in the near future, the following is the cotton market yesterday, converted by the American exchange rate of 7 yuan 3125, the factory price is as follows.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans are Strong and Strong; Sesame Market Remains Stable</h3>
<p>Soybeans: Yesterday's soybean market situation, since the rumor that the vehicles were blocked on the weekend, the source was not followed, and people's hearts were suddenly stimulated. Each bean line market stepped up and rose. The market transaction was only the goods transported by Japanese merchants.

<h3>Piece Goods: Spring and Summer Goods Grey Fabrics, Large Batch of Transactions, Market Plate Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Cloth: The cloth market is booming in Hong Kong and Nanyang, and wholesale numbers and dyeing factories in the street absorb large quantities of spring and summer grey fabrics, and speculators continue to be active, resulting in a continued increase in the market plate. White goods, coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill rise (per piece) 10 cents to 30 cents, bleached cloth per piece rises 20 to 30 cents, the rise in grey fabrics is more sharp, the fine colored satin grey fabrics have risen from about 37 yuan at the end of last month to the current market 434 yuan.

<h3>Coal Prices - Coal Balls Rise Another Six Dollars - Door Sales at Four Dollars and Twenty Cents Per Load</h3>
<p>Coal ball market prices, due to foreign exchange issues this month, have seen fellow traders increase prices several times within a week. Although yesterday (the 11th) the exchange rate was still stable, the selling price of coal balls increased by another six dollars per ton due to increased freight charges for foreign ships.

Retail sales at the door are four dollars and twenty cents per load.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market - Dutch Sugar Remains Tight</h3>

<p>Opening Special Edition of the Dahua Grand Theater</p>
<h3>Welcoming Guests</h3>
<p>Metabolism is a universal law of nature. In science, new and important inventions replace old dross. In major cities, new buildings are constantly being constructed for the same reason, with the new replacing the old.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, where population density has reached its peak, the need for a modern, scientifically advanced cinema is undeniable. The Far East Theater Company has taken on the responsibility of meeting this need by transforming the former Summer Theater, which has a considerable history in cinema, into a theater at the forefront of the times.</p>
<p>The eyes are the most impartial witnesses, and the mouth is the most faithful reporter. While welcoming our guests, we respectfully invite each guest to take a thorough tour with their eyes and to provide an objective report with their mouth.</p>
<p>The most important issue for a cinema is "safety first," followed by "convenience" and "comfort." Our theater's emergency exit facilities are perhaps the highest in Shanghai. Downstairs, there are three emergency exits leading to Rue Victor, and four leading to Bubbling Well Road; upstairs, there are three leading to Bubbling Well Road, and one leading to Rue Victor, for a total of eleven emergency exits, which is more than adequate for managing crowded audiences safely.</p>
<p>Public bus and tram stops are close by. There are four major roads for parking private cars: Bubbling Well Road, Xiaoxiao Lane, Route Doumer, and Rue Victor, which meet the meaning of the word "convenience." As for "comfort," it seems unnecessary to say more; let the guests make a fair judgment.</p>
<p>During the progress of the construction project and the compilation of this publication, we have received significant assistance, both directly and indirectly, from various parties. Here, we express our sincere gratitude to all parties with the utmost sincerity. And to the guests who have graciously come today, we extend our welcome and thanks with the utmost sincerity!</p>
<h3>Sound, Light, and Seating - A Brand New Appearance - The Latest Equipment</h3>
<p>The structure of a theater requires a sound organization, which is undoubtedly true. The so-called "heavenly timing," "geographical advantage," and "human harmony" are indeed necessary conditions. In addition to these three elements of heaven, earth, and man, the three beauties of sound, light, and seating are also interconnected. When establishing a new theater, while a beautiful exterior is certainly worth attention, its heart—the sound, light, and seating—must be given even greater importance. The Dahua Grand Theater opens today, and while we dare not boast that we have achieved perfection in the aforementioned three aspects, we have at least kept up with the times by adopting the most modern equipment, using facts as solid proof.</p>
<p>Coming to a cinema to watch a film means sitting and enjoying everything in front of you. The importance of the seating for the audience is closer than anything else, especially when sitting still for two hours, it is difficult to guarantee that your back, legs, and thighs will not experience numbness. The Dahua's seats, whether upstairs or downstairs, use the same type of construction, with the diameter and width of the seat specially widened, and the position of the installation lowered. The number of springs in the cushions has been increased, and they provide balanced elasticity according to each person's weight. Sitting down, they are soft and comfortable, giving the body and mind supreme pleasure, and avoiding the drawbacks of back pain from prolonged sitting. For this reason, the theater has sacrificed a considerable number of seats, but conversely, this sacrifice is worth it for the sake of the audience.</p>
<p>The Magnificent Appearance of the Dahua Grand Theater</p>
<p>The screen is the focal point of the audience's sightline, and the first requirement is that the light be bright and soft. On ordinary screens, the surface is covered with small holes, and when light is projected onto it, the strong light passes through the holes, damaging the brightness of the light. The Dahua uses the latest American-invented "no-hole" screen, which eliminates the above-mentioned drawbacks. The brightness is undiminished, as white as snow and as soft as velvet.</p>
<p>The sound system is the latest type of orthophonic machine from Altec Lansing, which produces sound that is no different from the original sound of the speaker. The dense, automatic light box further enhances the effect of lighting and sound. The projector is also a newly invented one used for the first time: the Ventzel "Ace" projector, whose effectiveness has been proven in major cinemas in the Americas, with no unevenness in light intensity or interruptions. The sound-absorbing paper on the four walls can enhance the sound's progress and reduce the interference of echoes, so that everyone's vision and hearing are completely satisfied.</p>
<p>Controlling the air conditioning and heating is a state-of-the-art air conditioner that extracts dirty air and delivers fresh, clean air. The exquisite foyer, the beautiful dressing rooms, and the quiet tea room provide everyone with great convenience. The color scheme inside and outside the theater, the artistic paint colors, and the crystal-clear artificial stone floor create an atmosphere of beauty and luxury, as if you were entering an imperial palace and witnessing the work of the gods.</p>
<p>Every corner reveals a new pattern, and every brick and tile uses new ingenuity, using the minds and efforts of many people to irrigate this new building, hoping that every audience member will have a satisfactory enjoyment and the highest entertainment.</p>
<h3>A Miracle in Film History - WOMEN - Without a Single Man - Reveals the Inner Suffering of Women - Scratches the Itch in Women's Hearts</h3>
<p>Women are the driving force behind all subversion in the world. How many emperors have been overthrown by the allure of women, and how many great men have succeeded through the encouragement of women. Men cannot live without women for a moment, and women cannot live without men for a moment. This film, "Women," however, forms a new style, without a single man participating in it, but the progress of the plot at every moment cannot escape the constraints and scope of men.</p>
<p>Starring are Norma Shearer, MGM's leading lady, along with Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, and Paulette Goddard, for a total of 135 women. It depicts women's daily lives—beauty treatments, hairdressing, bathing, massage, manicures, shopping—outlining a clear picture, drawing out a general tragicomedy of tears and laughter from the idle gossip over eating well and staying warm. Every bit of idle talk confirms what women usually say; every stimulus scratches the itch in women's hearts, and women cannot help but nod with a smile.</p>
<p>The entire performance is full of preciousness and wealth, with 237 gorgeous new outfits. Norma Shearer alone changes into twenty-four new outfits, Paulette Goddard's fur coat, Joan Crawford's hair bun, and precious jewelry will undoubtedly stir the attention of all Shanghai ladies. The fashion show scene is dyed in natural five colors, adding indescribable beauty. Joan Crawford's bathtub bathing scene broke the record for filming, taking eleven hours to shoot. For this scene, Joan Crawford slept for two days to recover her fatigue and rejuvenate her nerves.</p>
<p>A fight between Paulette Goddard and Rosalind Russell is a brilliant scene in the film, revealing women's abnormal psychology, grabbing hair and wrestling, rolling around on the ground, and finally, with itchy teeth, tearing women's trousers and biting a white and jade-like powder leg, expressing all the psychology of jealousy in these few actions.</p>
<p>Character descriptions include the gentleness of a deer, the docility of a sheep, the cunning of a monkey, the suspicion of a fox, the insidious nature of a night hawk, the straightforwardness of a horse, and the stupidity of an ox. "Women" is the surgeon's operating room for women's clinical experiments, showing their pathological conditions on the screen without mercy, making you blush and also making you willingly submit.</p>
<p>Rosalind Russell is the most outstanding person in the whole drama. Her style has completely changed, playing the role of an antagonist, with a posture of posing and modulating her tone, and a mouth full of garrulous idle talk, making people both angry and amused. She is the black fish spirit in the goldfish bowl, causing unrest in the six houses and disturbing the peace of the chickens and dogs.</p>

<h3>Film Stills - Every One is a Film You Want to See</h3>
<p>Films are the main blood vessels of a cinema, holding the soul of the entire theater. They have the power to draw a large theater full of people, without any gaps. Therefore, the most difficult core problem for a cinema to solve is the film itself, especially for a newly established cinema, which adds another layer of difficulty.</p>
<p>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) is the largest film company known to all film fans, with twenty-five male and female stars. The most famous actresses include Norma Shearer, Greta Garbo, Jeanette MacDonald, Myrna Loy, Ilona Massey, and Joan Crawford; the most famous actors include Clark Gable, William Powell, Wallace Beery, Robert Taylor, James Stewart, Nelson Eddy, and Fred Astaire. They are all the basic pillars of MGM, and each film they make is worth watching. It maintains the most glorious page in film history, and its Leo the Lion logo has become the king of all films.</p>
<p>At the time of its establishment, Dahua signed a long-term contract for the exclusive screening of MGM films with lightning speed, which is undoubtedly a major good news for film fans. To screen the world's best first-line films in Shanghai's newest first-line cinema can be said to be a rare and beautiful event.</p>
<p>Robert Donat's "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is an educational epic worth celebrating. The greatest achievement is Donat's acting skills, which have reached the pinnacle of apotheosis. He portrayed the gestures and actions of transitioning from adolescence to adulthood vividly. Finally, in his old age, his steps changed, his speech became more humorous, and his voice suddenly became old. No one believed that such a role was played by him alone from beginning to end.</p>
<p>The content and significance of this film not only declares that the old educators are loyal to education for life and tirelessly train their disciples, but also encourages everyone to be loyal to the country. He, with the qualifications of an old retiree, re-shoulders the full responsibility of education in the war-torn country, which is deepening the national crisis. Even on the night of the Great Bombardment, he remained calm and chose humorous jokes to dispel the atmosphere of terror. This courage and fortitude is worth everyone learning from.</p>
<p>To describe the excellence of "The Wizard of Oz," a brilliant writing brush would lose its effect. Only by witnessing it with your own eyes can you solve this difficulty. There are many things inside that cannot be described in words.</p>
<p>The various miracles of riding the clouds and driving the fog, flying sand and rocks, ten thousand rays of fog light, ten-foot demon fire, calling the wind and rain, and immortals fighting magic in mythology are all brought to the screen in this "The Wizard of Oz" by using the omnipotent power of science and vividly expressed. The characters appearing include the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion, and the Wicked Witch. In the mysterious myth, there is a story that fits life, not fearing difficulties, not fearing death, not surrendering, and achieving final victory, which is exactly what the film implies.</p>
<p>The capital used exceeds any MGM epic, costing a total of three million U.S. dollars. Producer Mervyn LeRoy has a wide reputation, and his masterpieces include "Little Caesar" and "Anthony Adverse." The director is George Cukor, who made "Little Women," and is famous for his clear methods and tight layout.</p>
<p>The entire film is dyed in beautiful natural five colors, with as many as five thousand actors. Starring Judy Garland, the recently rising singing child star, she had a very wonderful performance in "Pigskin Parade," and this film has even more surprising results. "The Wizard of Oz" can be counted as the first five-color epic with the largest cost this year.</p>
<p>Many tragic histories have been caused by misunderstandings between men and women in the world, wounding many hearts. "Sweethearts" writes about a pair of secretly married artists who hid their marriage for a long time due to professional problems. When the woman becomes famous, the man misunderstands and leaves. Lamenting separation and reunion, it marks the beginning of sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness covering the screen.</p>
<p>Jeanette MacDonald's loyalty to art is a fact that no one can deny. She plays the poor artist in this drama with a very exquisite performance. From making a name for herself through performing, heartbreak, separation, and reunion, she expresses her love and affection for her husband at all times through her eyebrows and eyes, making people pity, rejoice, grieve, and sympathize, constantly stirring the emotions of the movie audience to an unknown state. The entire film focuses on performance and is supplemented by singing, which is the best method for film producers to cater to the audience's psychology. MacDonald's singing voice has always been honored as a golden voice, and with her serious performance, the entire film is touching and makes people feel indescribably uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The male lead, Nelson Eddy, established ten times his reputation in "All Quiet on the Western Front." This time, he made a comeback, paired with MacDonald, and also had a very superb performance, conveying the psychology of loving each other, and being both jealous and hateful, expressing it completely.</p>

<h3>Commemoration of President Chiang's Ordeal - All Circles Advocate the廉恥(liánchǐ) Movement</h3>
<p>All circles in this city, commemorating the third anniversary of President Chiang's Xi'an ordeal today, currently value the period of resistance war and nation-building. Citizens of the isolated island should show something for this significant commemoration, and it has been decided to start promoting the lianchi (廉恥, integrity and honor) movement from today, in order to encourage oneself and others. The tenets of this movement are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Sincere Unity, Sacrifice for the Country</p>
<p>Our China is the earliest country to promote world culture. For five thousand years, it has respected morality, and the deeds of loyalty and dedication have been continuously recorded in history. The non-diminishment of the nation and the independence of the country depend on this great spirit. Since the War of Resistance, the soldiers at the front and the civilians in the rear have been united with sincerity and sacrificing for the country. With justice upheld and the enemy contained, if we can be of one mind and one heart, enduring and unyielding, then not only can we be confident of final victory, but the future of nation-building will also receive boundless prosperity. This is an immutable truth and is also demonstrated by the facts.</p>
<p>Diligent Self-Improvement, Perseverance and Struggle</p>
<p>With the national army withdrawing westward, the citizens of the isolated island, although temporarily losing the protection of the government, still share honor and disgrace, survival and death. How should we diligently improve ourselves, persevere and struggle to recover our land and rescue those in dire straits? Looking around at the current situation, while there are many who are loyal, unwavering, and enterprising, there are also not a few who are declining in will and falling in character. It must be known that freedom and happiness can only be obtained through difficult struggles. Without thorough resistance, we can never win national independence and guarantee the survival of ourselves and our future generations. The eight-year war of the United States and the ten-year plan of the Soviet Union can be used as examples. Historical evidence is clear and undeniable.</p>
<p>Self-Initiated Correction, Promote Integrity and Honor</p>
<p>We, who serve in all circles, are ashamed of our lack of achievements, but our love for the country has not diminished. We believe that the current unfortunate phenomenon, although there are many reasons, is mainly due to the ancient customs and the loss of integrity and honor. If we want to correct ourselves spontaneously, it is best to cultivate integrity and honor. For only by cultivating integrity can we be selfless and devoted to public service, and only by understanding honor can we be inspired to strive for strength. Therefore, respecting morality and promoting integrity and honor are the most urgent plans and fundamental strategies for completing the great cause of resistance and nation-building. Nothing surpasses this. Therefore, we gather like-minded people, based on the meaning of encouraging self-improvement and initiating a movement to promote integrity and honor, in order to save the crisis and revive the nation. Patriotic compatriots, why not come? If we are fortunate enough to be taught by virtuous scholars from home and abroad, it would be even more fortunate.</p>
<h3>Supply Committee Discussed Yesterday Further Lowering Rice Prices, Waiting for a Considerable Time Before Further Stabilization, The Guild Suggests Purchasing Large Quantities of Foreign Rice, Planning a Second Round of Price Stabilization</h3>
<p>The Bean and Rice Industry Association previously sent a letter to Yu Qiaqing, requesting that he handle the price stabilization according to the previous application for foreign exchange, to further relieve the people and stabilize rice prices. According to a well-informed source speaking to a Datong News Agency reporter last night, this action will be taken next week, after a certain influential figure in the local business community consults with the banking community. The method may involve cooperation between important groups in Shanghai to jointly bear the expenses, and the banking community will advance these funds first. As for applying for legal foreign exchange, a decision will also be made on that day and telegraphed to the central government for approval.</p>
<p>The Food and Fuel Supply Committee of the Public Works Department held a meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 11th). Attendees included Sir Maher (Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce), Mr. Aveline (Manager of Daofu Foreign Firm), Mr. Hatton (Manager of Taigu Foreign Firm), and the heads of the PWD's finance, police, and sanitation departments. According to inquiries made by a Xinsheng News Agency reporter, the meeting conducted a detailed review of the current market conditions after the rice price limits were imposed, paying particular attention to how the restrictions have been implemented by various parties. The meeting also thoroughly discussed the issue of further lowering the current price limits (i.e., the highest price for white粳 rice should not exceed 45 yuan, and the highest price for 秈 rice and foreign rice should not exceed 38 yuan) after a certain period. All attendees showed great enthusiasm for safeguarding the food supply for the city's residents. It is reported that the result of the discussions was a decision to strictly enforce the price limits stipulated in the announcement, while also further examining inventory and rice arrivals, in order to achieve the original intention of lowering rice prices and benefiting the people. According to the Wenrenmei Evening News, Mr. Felippucci, Director-General and President of the PWD, paid a private visit to the Central Consulate General at 10:30 AM this morning (the 11th). Mr. Felippucci declined to comment on the purpose of his trip. However, many believe that Mr. Felippucci was discussing the current development of the rice situation with officials from the Wu Consulate General.</p>
<p>Reasonable Price Stabilization and Re-establishment of Price Limits</p>
<p>The announcement by the Concession authorities prohibiting rice hoarding, speculation, and manipulation has been posted by the respective police departments in various locations yesterday, informing all citizens. The announcement consists of two versions, one in Chinese and one in English. Citizens from all walks of life paid close attention to this announcement, standing to read it carefully and expressing strong support for the authorities' measures. It is reported that the Concession authorities are determined to strictly enforce the newly established rice price limits. Any further hoarding or manipulation will be severely punished. Rice prices have already fallen slightly yesterday, and it is expected that they will continue to decline. According to well-informed sources, the current price limits are intended as a temporary emergency measure. When rice prices fall to a natural level, the current price limits will be further lowered, ensuring that rice prices become more stable over time.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants' Reaction to the Authorities</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reports that local rice merchants have been in an uproar today (the 11th) over the announcement issued by the French Concession Municipal Council and the Public Concession Public Works Department regarding hoarding and manipulating rice. They believe this announcement is self-defeating. These people want to know why the announcement does not mention coal or rent, etc. A certain rice merchant told a reporter today that what authority does the PWD have to confiscate the legally stored rice of merchants? If this happens, rice merchants will be alarmed and will stop importing rice, and the increase in rice prices is due to the taxes collected by the Japanese along the way. Why does the announcement only mention rice, while other foods, as well as coal and rent, are not mentioned? This morning, the reporter asked a PWD official about what authority the PWD has to confiscate stored rice. The official replied that there is no such provision in the law, but the PWD can do so under its inherent emergency powers. The Bureau hopes that such a necessity will not arise.</p>
<p>Thoroughly Punish Rice Merchants Who Violate Orders</p>
<p>The reporter asked, what kind of compensation will be given for confiscated rice? The spokesperson replied that this matter has not been considered, but if such a situation occurs, then this point will naturally have to be considered. The reporter also asked, why doesn't the PWD curb the high prices of other items such as coal and rent? The spokesperson replied that the PWD considers rice to be the most obvious example. In the future, the Bureau may have no choice but to curb the high prices of other items. The reporter then asked, how will the PWD expel rice merchants from the Public Concession? The reply was, by putting them on a ship heading to Vietnam. This statement indicates close cooperation between the Bureau and the French authorities. The spokesperson also said that although the PWD understands that rice is being extorted for taxes outside the city, it believes that the selling price of domestic rice is too high, because speculators are setting the price of domestic rice based on the price of Saigon rice.</p>
<p>Suggest Chamber of Commerce Group Purchase Rice</p>
<p>In addition to sending the previously reported, agreed-upon fundamental and short-term solutions to the Public Concession Public Works Department and the French Concession Municipal Council for their consideration, the Bean and Rice Industry Association also suggested that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce organize the group purchase of foreign rice. The original letter states, "Respected Sirs, Recently, the price of rice in Shanghai has been increasing incessantly, which is of great concern to the people's livelihood and public security. We should find ways to remedy this situation in order to achieve balance. The Association convened a meeting of its executive and supervisory committee on the ninth of this month, and decided on various fundamental and short-term solutions. Regarding short-term solutions, we accept the Public Works Department's suggestion to re-establish price limits. Regarding fundamental solutions, we request that the authorities of the two concessions find ways to dredge the sources of supply, etc., which will not be elaborated on here. What must be submitted to your esteemed association is the following: (1) Mr. Yu Qiaqing previously initiated a group purchase of foreign rice, but the matter did not come to fruition. Now, in order to ensure an adequate food supply for the people, it is still advisable to order foreign rice. Although there are a small number of rice businesses ordering, their strength is still weak and their effect is minimal. We propose that your association, together with the authorities of the two concessions and Mr. Yu, invite representatives from various public organizations to discuss and separately organize group purchase methods, ensuring that each public organization aggregates the needs of its affiliated companies, firms, factories, and freelancers, and orders in large quantities. If so, the strength will be great and the effect will be significant. With an adequate food supply for the people, we will not have to worry about rice prices not being stable. (2) Currently, the high price of rice is most painful for the common people. Mr. Yu previously obtained approval for a legal foreign exchange to order foreign rice and conduct price stabilization sales. Although the amount was not large, the poor have benefited not shallowly. Now, we propose that your association, together with Mr. Yu, follow the previous example and submit another request to the Ministry of Finance to approve the allocation of a certain amount of legal foreign exchange, approximately enough to order 50,000 bags of foreign rice. At the same time, we will ask the banking industry to advance funds for procurement, so that we can conduct price stabilization sales again to help the poor. (3) Currently, the price of rice is expensive, and the cost of procurement and transportation has doubled. To increase the supply of goods, it depends on having sufficient financial resources. Therefore, we propose that your association inform the banking industry to provide as much loans as possible to those who purchase domestic or foreign rice in order to increase procurement and transportation and increase supply. The above three matters are indeed the most important plans at the moment. We hope that you will adopt them and implement them quickly, so that rice prices can be balanced and the people's livelihood can be stabilized. We respectfully address the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce." In addition, a letter was sent to Yu Qiaqing to assist in handling the matter, with similar wording.</p>
<p>Market Stabilizes as Foreign Rice Continues to Arrive</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the Public Works Department's price limit implementation in the Rice Industry Tea House Market. Mr. Fu Qian'geng, Chairman of the Market Management Committee, as well as the duty committee members Mr. Zhang Lizhong and Mr. Zheng Shengyun, and the supervisory personnel assigned by the two concession authorities, all arrived at the market to monitor transactions among the traders. Also, because the authorities of the two concessions have severe penalties for those who speculate and monopolize rice, such as not protecting them or expelling them from the country, and confiscating their inventory, market transactions are becoming more stable, and those who sell short and buy long to make profits are also disappearing. According to a certain rice merchant, in addition to the foreign rice previously ordered by Shanghai rice merchants arriving in Shanghai in succession, another 40,000 bags of Saigon rice arrived yesterday, shipped by the Ma Le Wheel to Shanghai. Currently, the foreign rice that has been ordered by various rice merchants but has not yet been shipped to Shanghai totals 300,000 bags. If the ordered foreign rice can arrive in Shanghai within a week, then the Shanghai market will see an even more abundant supply of foreign rice.</p>
<h3>Da Xin Dispute Resolved, Xian Shi Went on Strike Yesterday, The Public Works Department Has Sent Personnel to Mediate, Labor and Management Can Negotiate a Solution</h3>
<p>Since the prices of goods in Shanghai have soared and rice is as expensive as pearls, the people's livelihoods have been affected. Recently, employees in the industrial and commercial sectors have successively requested employers to appropriately increase their salaries in order to maintain their livelihoods. Fortunately, both labor and management have been able to understand the current difficulties, and thus have been able to find appropriate and fair solutions based on the principle of coordination. Only the employees of Da Xin Company briefly went on strike on [date] because their demands were not met at that time. Afterwards, it was resolved satisfactorily and business resumed as usual yesterday. In addition, more than 700 employees of Xian Shi Company continued to go on strike yesterday morning. The company authorities said that they had telegraphed the Hong Kong headquarters for instructions. In general, if the management can accept their opinions, it is expected that a solution can be reached immediately. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Xian Shi Employees on Strike Yesterday</p>
<p>More than 700 middle and low-level employees of the Xian Shi Company on Nanjing Road sent representatives twice on the eighth and ninth to visit the authorities, requesting the restoration of pre-war work compensation and the distribution of year-end profit bonuses, a temporary rice allowance of five yuan, and effective job security, etc., for the sake of stabilizing their lives during this period of skyrocketing prices. Their requests were not adopted by the authorities. During this negotiation period, the commercial center operated as usual. After the company stopped operating at 8 PM the night before, they sent representatives to visit the authorities for the third time, but were still not accepted. All employees officially went on strike yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Branch Staff Respond Enthusiastically</p>
<p>In addition to the Nanjing Road headquarters, Xian Shi Company also has two branches located on Xialfei Road and Jing'an Temple Road. After receiving notice of the headquarters' strike in the morning, they also decided to close and participate. At about 9 AM, they went to the Nanjing Road headquarters one after another to discuss solutions. Upon hearing the news, the police also dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to station there. Except for the side door on Zhejiang Road, which could still be used for entry and exit, the iron gates at all entrances of the commercial center were sealed off. The side door could only be used for exit and not entry. Even employees of the company could not enter or exit freely. Without a special pass from the police, there was no room for compromise. Therefore, dozens of employees who went from the branch stores were rejected outside the door.</p>
<p>Sympathy From All Quarters for Consolation</p>
<p>After Xian Shi Company went on strike yesterday morning, all male and female employees gathered in the commercial center to discuss negotiation methods. Upon hearing this unfortunate news, colleagues from Yong An, Da Xin, Xin Xin, and other companies were very sympathetic and sent representatives to bring food for consolation. At [time] in the afternoon, the Industry Section of the Public Works Department tried to mediate. The company manager also arrived at the time, but negotiations between the two sides still yielded no results.</p>
<p>Xian Shi Authorities Express Attitude</p>
<p>It is also learned that Xian Shi Company authorities replied to the Industry Section of the Public Works Department, represented by Mr. Gu, who went to convene labor-management mediation, as follows: (1) Monthly work compensation [days] days are currently only given by our company. No other company has this, so it is difficult to give an additional three days. In the future, it can only be implemented if all companies in the industry agree. (2) The rice allowance can be guaranteed, but the amount and method must await a reply from the headquarters. (3) Bonuses must be based on the company's established methods. (4) Employees should not be dismissed without reason. The company has never implemented this. The above four items are the personal opinions of the Shanghai branch manager. The exact situation is still subject to the Hong Kong headquarters' reply and handling.</p>
<p>Conditions Proposed by Da Xin Employees</p>
<p>Da Xin Company on [street name] Road was the first to go on strike to request an increase in salaries. More than 600 employees of the company sent four representatives to the company authorities on the morning of the ninth to propose four improved treatment conditions. By noon on the tenth, the management had not yet resolved the matter satisfactorily, which led to a short strike starting at 1:30 PM on the afternoon of the tenth. After much mediation, work resumed at 4:30 PM that afternoon. At that time, the employees' demands included: (1) Salary increase: trainees will receive an additional five yuan, employees with salaries up to twenty-five yuan will receive an additional eight yuan, those below thirty-five yuan will receive an additional ten yuan, and those above thirty-five yuan will receive an additional 10%. Allowances will not be cancelled after the salary increase. (2) According to salary calculation, each yuan should be allocated a bonus of 3.5 jiao, to be settled at the end of the year. (3) Each person will be given a work compensation fee of five days per month. (4) Employees should not be dismissed without reason, and employee life should be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Da Xin Strike Fully Resolved</p>
<p>After the company's employees implemented the strike the day before yesterday afternoon, they sent representatives to visit Supervisor Cai Chang of the company again at 8 PM on the tenth, earnestly requesting that he consider the year-round hard work of the colleagues, who have always been diligent in their duties. The colleagues' request to improve their treatment is entirely due to environmental pressure, and the colleagues have no further demands. They only ask that they can live without excessive panic in this era of expensive goods, which is enough. Negotiations continued until 12 PM. Supervisor Cai then accepted all four demands made by the employees, namely: (1) Regarding the salary increase issue, it was approved to take effect from this month. (2) Bonuses will also be implemented from the end of the old lunar year of this year. However, it is not limited to a deduction of 3.5 cents per yuan per month, but rather the entire monthly salary will be calculated, with at least two months' salary being added for each person. (3) Restoring work compensation. The authorities believe that this principle is acceptable, but it must be jointly discussed by other companies. Da Xin cannot agree to it alone. (4) Job security is absolutely guaranteed. The representatives considered it satisfactory and immediately summoned all colleagues to report the negotiations with Supervisor Cai. The colleagues also believed that the negotiations were satisfactory and unanimously decided to resume business yesterday morning. The colleagues' association then issued a notice, encouraging all colleagues to do their best in their respective positions and work diligently, in order to live up to the high expectations of the authorities and to conform to the spirit of sincere unity between labor and management, in order to overcome the difficulties of this extraordinary period. As a result, the sky cleared and the clouds dispersed, which is a great blessing amidst misfortune.</p>
<h3>Shandong Guild Telegraphed Condolences to the Wu Family</h3>
<p>The Shandong Guild telegraphed condolences to the family of General Wu Peifu, saying, "To the Family of General Wu in Beiping. We previously read in the newspapers that the General suddenly returned to the Taoist mountain due to a tooth ailment. The shocking news was widely reported, and we deeply mourn his passing. We specially send this telegram to express our condolences. We hope that you will restrain your grief and accept the change, so as to assist in major affairs. Respectfully, all members of the Shandong Guild in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Goods on Da Xin Ship Entirely Sunk, Insurance Company to Investigate and then Proceed with Compensation Procedures</h3>
<p>The British Da Xin ship left Wenzhou on the fourth of this month to come to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, when it arrived near Huanghua Pass outside the port of Wenzhou, it suddenly encountered a wind and hit a reef. Fortunately, nearby sailing ships did their best to rescue the crew, and all crew members were rescued. However, all of the goods loaded on board, mostly heavy items, could not be transported and were entirely sunk. The agent of the ship, the American firm Hua Shi Zai Xing, received a telegram the day before yesterday and contacted the insurance company that insured the ship. It is reported that the insurance company has decided to send a ship to investigate and then proceed with compensation.</p>
<h3>Relieving Refugees, Distributing Ginger Tea</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Shen Youyu submitted a letter to this newspaper, saying, "It is reported that the weather has been extremely cold recently, and nearly a hundred refugees have frozen to death. Who can bear to witness this? The severe winter has just begun, and there are many more cold waves. Those homeless people on the streets are like sparrows waiting to die on branches. Although refugees and displaced people have become a societal problem, it is still an urgent matter for philanthropists to treat the symptoms. I have found that ginger tea has the function of warding off the cold. When life is barely clinging on against the wind, it may be possible to survive with its help. I believe there are many people of great compassion in Shanghai. If powerful people can set up stoves to distribute ginger tea in a few locations in the concession boundary, so that the fires of the stoves remain red and the ginger tea remains warm, it may be a way to save lives."</p>
<h3>Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Issued a Letter to All Merchants and Citizens, Sharing the Responsibility of Stabilizing Prices, Do Not Hoard or Monopolize, Lest You Risk the Consequences of the Law</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a letter to all merchants and citizens, saying, "For several months, prices have risen sharply and the people's livelihood has been extremely difficult. White rice has reached as high as forty-five yuan per stone, and fuel has also continued to rise. Rice and coal are essential daily necessities, and life depends on them. One cannot be without them even for a day. The income of employees can barely cover these two expenses, and they already feel exhausted. In addition, rent, clothing, and daily necessities are all expensive, and nothing can be saved. They tell each other with furrowed brows, look up at the sky and sigh, and tremble at the thought of the future. Now, the Public Works Department has imposed a maximum price limit on rice, and the raging fire has been temporarily contained. However, stabilizing the market and maintaining public security requires the joint efforts of all sectors of society to be effective. Therefore, we earnestly advise that all industries should, from now on, share the heart of mutual assistance and common responsibility for stabilizing prices. Do not hoard or manipulate the goods you deal in. You must know that for the past two years, merchants and citizens have endured hardship in this extraordinary period, struggling to overcome difficulties and working hard in their respective positions. This sentiment and this aspiration are deeply understood by this association. Now that the difficulties are increasing, how can we bear to address only the symptoms without addressing the root cause, so as to damage our own reputation and risk the consequences of the law? Maintaining social order is the responsibility of all citizens. Please cherish yourselves and do not disappoint our hopes."</p>

<h3>Financial Situation of the Public Works Department, The Estimated Deficit After Offsetting Revenue and Expenditure for This Year is More Than 6.08 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The Director of Finance of the Public Works Department recently submitted a report to the Board of Directors of the Bureau, containing the Bureau's final accounts of revenue and expenditure as of the end of September of this year, and an overview of the estimated recurrent revenue and expenditure for this year. It is stated that after offsetting revenue and expenditure for this year, the estimated deficit is 6,052,160.61 yuan in national currency. In addition, the deficit in educational funds is 30,150 yuan, totaling 6,082,310.62 yuan, which is 3,758,530.61 yuan more than the deficit stated in the budget. It is found that ordinary expenditures increased by 5,366,442.46 yuan compared with the budget, and education expenses increased by 342,485.37 yuan compared with the budget, totaling 5,708,927.83 yuan. Various revenues increased by 1,950,397.12 yuan compared with the budget, with the difference being 3,758,530.61 yuan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Recurrent Revenue</p>
<p>(Ordinary Category) The various revenues in this category increased by 1,934,307.26 yuan compared with the budget. House tax inside and outside the boundary increased by 590,619.91 yuan and 110,767.48 yuan respectively compared with the budget. The important reasons for this are three: (1) The number of residents in the East District is gradually increasing. (2) Factories in the West District are developing. (3) The construction of new residences. In addition, pier fees, license fees, and revenue from public municipal undertakings increased by 153,996.46 yuan, 349,814.38 yuan, and 649,570.16 yuan respectively.</p>
<p>Recurrent Expenditure</p>
<p>(Ordinary Category) The various expenditures in this category exceeded the budget by 5,366,442.46 yuan. Among them, the main items are ordinary expenditures (including expenditures not belonging to various departments, such as pensions and other retirement benefits, subsidies, and refunded taxes and house rents), which increased by 2,374,308.40 yuan. The Police Department increased by 1,016,026.56 yuan, prisons and reformatories increased by 295,541.92 yuan, the Public Works Department increased by 551,912.08 yuan, and the purchase cost of storage funds in various departments increased by 724,605.83 yuan. The tightening of exchange rates this year is the main reason for the increase in various expenditures in this category.</p>
<p>Police Expenditure</p>
<p>(Ordinary) The expenditures in this category exceeded the budget by 1,016,026.56 yuan. Among them, salaries accounted for 517,641.98 yuan, and other expenditures accounted for 498,384.58 yuan. The salary item includes temporary living allowances of 388,159.01 yuan, exchange rate allowances of 37. 个73.62 yuan, and long-holiday exchange rate allowances of 68,046.08 yuan. Due to the increase in treatment for Japanese police officers, the total basic salary increased by 60,117.67 yuan. Other expenditures include fuel costs of 157,779.39 yuan, vehicle and horse expenses of 96,489.11 yuan, uniform and equipment costs of 67,910.01 yuan, medical expenses of 41,834.47 yuan, electricity bills of 56.70 yuan.30 yuan, water bills of 15,606.42 yuan, printing and stationery expenses of 18,747.62 yuan, and maintenance and repair costs of 31,615.98 yuan, etc. The increase in these expenses is due to the tightening of exchange rates and the soaring cost of labor and materials. Among the increased expenditures for prisons and reformatories, prisoners' food accounted for 219,329.41 yuan. The reasons for this are the skyrocketing prices and the increase in the number of prisoners.</p>
<p>Public Works Expenditure</p>
<p>(Ordinary) The expenditures increased by 551,921.08 yuan. Among them, 263,055.63 yuan was for garbage management. The reason for such a large increase in this expenditure is that the amount of garbage is increasing greatly every day, and the Bureau must pay subsidies to the competent authorities of the garbage dump sites outside the boundary every month. The Shanghai Electric Power Company and the Huxi Electric Power Company were approved to collect surcharges, and the Bureau's burden exceeded the budget by 106,568.78 yuan.</p>
<p>Purchase of Storage Items</p>
<p>Expenditures in this category exceeded the budget by 724,605.83 yuan. The expenses for road-building materials and other supplies required by the Public Works Department, and the various expenses for uniforms made by the Police Department accounted for the majority of this. The reasons are nothing more than the tightening of exchange rates and the soaring prices of goods.</p>
<p>Education Expenses</p>
<p>The educational expenses provided from the recurrent revenue are 2,592,835.41 yuan. This number is the maximum amount that can be provided from the property tax according to the current education policy. The estimated deficit is still 30,150 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Hongqiao Sanatorium in Western Shanghai is Occupied by the Japanese Army, Wooden Houses are Being Built Next to the Hospital with Unknown Uses, The Plan to Relocate the Russian Hospital is Cancelled</h3>
<p>The Hongqiao Sanatorium at 310 Hongqiao Road in Western Shanghai occupies a large area and has magnificent architecture. It has been empty since the "August 13th" incident, with the Italian flag hanging outside for more than two years. Recently, it was suddenly occupied by the Japanese army, and many wooden houses were built on the open space east of the hospital and west of Fales Road. The graves in the area have been levelled, and the area has been fenced off with wire mesh. Many believe that these wooden houses will be used as storage places for military equipment or parking for vehicles. As for what purpose the Japanese army will use the building, there are various theories. Some say it will be used as a Japanese military hospital, while others say it will be used as a dormitory for the puppet police. The truth is still unclear. It is also unknown whether the Japanese army leased or bought the building from the owner, or even occupied it by force. However, according to what we have heard, the Russian Orthodox Church in Shanghai originally had two hospitals, one on Shanzhong Road and the other on Zhao Zhujiao Road. The latter is a mental hospital. Because the address is too small and the equipment is insufficient, it was planned to borrow the Hongqiao Road Sanatorium and relocate there. It was being discussed, but the Japanese army occupied the sanatorium, so the plan of the Orthodox Church was completely obstructed and did not come to fruition.</p>
<h3>French Concession News: River Gate Opened Yesterday; New North Gate to Open in Five Days; New North Gate Entrance and Xin Kai River Exit for Future Population</h3>
<p>There was much talk about the French Concession opening the iron gate on Rue de la République linking to the southern part of the city, but it was repeatedly delayed due to security concerns. However, the French Concession Municipal Council, considering the inconvenience to residents entering and exiting the southern city via a detour through Paitung, decided to show consideration and planned to open the Xin Kai River iron gate on the 10th of this month. However, due to procedural and preparatory issues, the opening was changed to</p>
<p>Trial Opening</p>
<p>Yesterday. This news was first reported by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, Kong Chou. The Xin Kai River iron gate officially opened at 5 AM yesterday under the supervision of French, Russian, and Vietnamese police. Those entering or exiting the area no longer need permits issued by the French Concession. Those entering the southern city from the Concession only need to hold a white "Resident Certificate" from the southern city. To understand the situation, the reporter</p>
<p>Went to Investigate</p>
<p>Yesterday. Along the Xin Kai River area of the Bund in the French Concession, the number of people entering and exiting the southern city with the elderly and children was extremely crowded. To maintain order, the French Concession stationed Chinese detectives at the entrance of Xin Kai River to direct traffic. Those entering the southern city or leaving the Concession walked on the left-hand sidewalk, while the center was a thoroughfare for cars. The reporter saw Japanese naval personnel entering and exiting the Concession, all using</p>
<p>This Road.</p>
<p>The Southern City Resident Certificate Inspection Point is located in front of the Jiangsu Farmers' Bank and the Sheng Sheng Ranch Southern City Office on Rue de la République, Xin Kai River. The inspection procedures are carried out by Japanese military police. Citizens entering and exiting must remove their hats but do not bow. To avoid pedestrian congestion, a sign at the entrance reads "Walk on the Left." Generally, citizens now know that Xin Kai River is passable, and all flock to this gate to enter and exit, leading to</p>
<p>Ferry Sampans</p>
<p>Experiencing a sharp decline in business and crying out in distress. According to Western newspapers, rents in the area of Old North Gate, Fuyou Road, and the Nine Mu Land in the southern city have already increased several times. There are even cases where people are willing to pay an extra fee but still cannot find a place to live. The French Concession authorities are conducting a trial opening for five days this time to see how it goes and then decide whether to continue. Another piece of news received by the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter is that the New North Gate iron gate may also be opened soon. The opening date is approximately five days later, and it has been decided that the New North Gate iron gate will be the entrance, while Xin Kai River will be changed to the exit.</p>
<h3>British Women's Association to Show Film to Raise Funds for Wartime Work</h3>
<p>The British Women's Association is scheduled to screen the film "Qie Lai" at its clubhouse at 9:15 PM on Thursday this week to help make up for the shortfall in wartime work funds. The screening of the film was initiated by Lady Kerr, wife of the British Ambassador to China. In addition to a popular comedic play written by a famous British screenwriter, the film will also feature exotic scenery along the way from Canada, Australia, and South Africa. Those who want to feast their eyes can purchase tickets at the association's general office. Tickets are priced at three yuan each.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forcefully Enclose Civilian Land in Zhabei to Build Vegetable Market</h3>
<p>To control the supply of vegetables and food in the city, the Japanese recently forcefully enclosed over 30 mu of civilian land behind the Four Banks Warehouse and the Continental Bank Warehouse at the eastern end of Guangfu Road in Zhabei, bordering North Xizang Road to the west and Manchuria Road. Construction is currently underway, and it is expected to be completed within the year, with business operations starting next spring.</p>
<h3>Over 400 Bicycles Seized for Transporting Rice</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese took control of grain in Shanghai, the supply has become scarce and prices have soared. Recently, all rice transport licenses for various forwarding companies have been revoked, making it impossible to transport rice to the concessions. Unscrupulous hoarders are taking the opportunity to raise prices limitlessly. However, inland rice merchants are unable to find buyers, causing the market to stagnate. Seeing the potential for profit, villagers are using bicycles to transport rice from the Zongshan Road in west Shanghai, through Zhabei, to Hongkou and the Eight Concessions, earning over ten yuan per day. Therefore, in recent days, these rice vendors have been constantly coming and going. Now, they have been suddenly banned by the Japanese military stationed in the Lin Ken Road, west Shanghai, and both the bicycles and the rice have been confiscated. It is said that over 400 bicycles have been seized in the past two days.</p>
<h3>French Police Seize 150,000 Copper Coins; Public Believes Smuggling Merchants Can Be Investigated</h3>
<p>At around 10 AM yesterday, French police officers discovered a large amount of copper auxiliary coins hidden in a car while searching pedestrians on Songshan Road. Suspecting that they were smuggling copper coins, they took them to the police station together. Upon inspection, the number of copper coins reached as many as 150,000. Strict interrogation is currently underway. It is found that these copper auxiliary coins have recently disappeared, mostly hoarded by unscrupulous merchants for sale at high prices, which has greatly affected the financial situation. After the news of the seizure was revealed, all sectors applauded, because it can enable the authorities to investigate the unscrupulous merchants who manipulated the purchase.</p>
<h3>Housing Dispute in Qing Yu Li: Mediation Fails; Retrial Opens for Debate Yesterday</h3>
<p>The contract between the Shanghai Women's Bank, the contractor of the Qing Yu Li houses on Chongqing Road, and the Poor Children's Education Institute, the owner, stipulated that the houses in the neighborhood must be renovated by January 1, 1939; otherwise, the Women's Bank would forfeit the deposit of 59,000 yuan and compensate for a loss of 150,000 yuan. Therefore, based on the contract, the Women's Bank filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court last year, ordering more than 3,000 tenants in over 60 households in the neighborhood to move out. As a result, after</p>
<p>Three Trials,</p>
<p>The tenants were all defeated. Up until the date of forced execution, the tenants, due to the extraordinary period and the over-demand for housing in Shanghai, were unable to move, leading to repeated disputes. Recently, the tenants discovered that before the conclusion of the second instance debate, the Women's Bank had reached a settlement with the Poor Children's Education Institute, with the Poor Children's Education Institute agreeing to extend the deadline for three years and reduce the rent. Therefore, Yuan Yang'an, Su Jingqi, and Yu Chengxiu, lawyers, filed</p>
<p>A Retrial</p>
<p>With the Second Branch of the High Court. The High Court approved it and held a hearing once. The court ordered mediation. Yesterday, the case was heard by Han Zuzhi, Chief Judge of the Civil Division of the Second Branch of the High Court, along with judges Shen Hong and Zhang Qinglan. First, lawyer Yuan stated that during the extension period, the plaintiffs in the retrial, represented by his firm, sent a letter to the Women's Bank proposing a settlement method: (1) extending the lease period, (2) the tenants agreeing to moderately increase the rent, and (3) the losses suffered by both parties due to the litigation should be verified and mutually</p>
<p>Compensated.</p>
<p>He stated that this was extremely fair, but the Women's Bank had no intention of settling the matter, and that their agent had discussed it with Manager Yao of the bank but received no reply. The lawyer representing the Women's Bank stated that regarding the settlement, the Women's Bank requested evidence to clarify the issue of the tenants' representation because there were still problems with it, but they did not receive a reply, so there was no room for negotiation. The court immediately asked that since the tenants had proposed a settlement method, the Women's Bank should also have a method to</p>
<p>Negotiate</p>
<p>And reach a settlement. However, the lawyer stated that it was difficult to negotiate the method proposed by the tenants, so it was obviously difficult to reach a settlement. The court then questioned both parties in detail on the facts and the law and ordered the debate to begin. First, lawyer Yuan Yang'an argued that the reason for the Women's Bank's lawsuit was the contract signed with the Poor Children's Education Institute, which stated that if the house was not renovated by January 1, 1939, the Women's Bank would suffer a loss of more than 200,000 yuan. Now that the contract has been</p>
<p>Extended for Three Years,</p>
<p>The Women's Bank is no longer at risk of suffering a loss. Moreover, in the current extraordinary circumstances, the demand for housing exceeds the supply, and it is difficult to find a house. It is not the tenants' intention to deliberately make things difficult and refuse to move. Now that there is evidence of this new fact, the tenants have filed this lawsuit, requesting the court to overturn the original judgment based on the evidence and order the Women's Bank to bear all litigation costs. Lawyer Yu then further explained the evidence obtained. Lawyer Su was about to argue, but the court declared the debate suspended because it was past noon, and scheduled the debate to continue at a later date.</p>
<h3>Antique Tycoon Miao Xihua Accused of Embezzling Family Property; Defendant Absent, Hearing Adjourned</h3>
<p>Miao Xihua, a wealthy Ningbo merchant in Shanghai, has been buying antiques in the Beijing-Shanghai area for many years. Through skillful operations, he has accumulated over one million yuan and owns many properties in Shanghai. Recently, his nephews, Miao Zhonghao and Miao Yinghao, filed a complaint through lawyers Zhang Shouchun and Hu Yongde in the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, accusing him of embezzling family property. The complaint stated that the plaintiffs' late father, Mr. Xi Rong, had</p>
<p>Three Brothers.</p>
<p>The eldest brother, Xi Fan, currently resides in Ningbo. The plaintiffs' father was the second brother. The third uncle, Xi Hua, is the defendant in this case. The family's total property is estimated at 1.5 million yuan. The family's wealth began when the plaintiffs' father, Xi Rong, invested 40,000 yuan in the first year of the Republic of China and handed it over to the defendant, his third uncle, to jointly purchase antiques and treasures from the former Qing Palace in Beijing. Within a few months, they made a profit of over one million yuan. Later, they continued to purchase, earning tens of thousands of yuan within a few years. At that time, the plaintiffs' father was doing business in his hometown, while the defendant was</p>
<p>Trading Antiques</p>
<p>In Beijing. Due to the distance and brotherly affection, he did not suspect anything. Later, the defendant returned to his hometown once, and the plaintiffs' father settled accounts with him. Unexpectedly, the defendant embezzled the 40,000 yuan investment and 500,000 yuan in profits, which can be testified to by direct relatives and close relatives. Later, in 1934, the plaintiffs' mother went to the defendant's house to negotiate for a division of property. Unexpectedly, the defendant became angry and assaulted her, leading to a criminal prosecution. However, after repeated mediation by relatives and friends, the criminal case was settled with a 4,000 yuan</p>
<p>Severance</p>
<p>Relationship. At that time, the plaintiffs and their mother were forced to settle the case due to economic pressure. The criminal case was exchanged for a completely unrelated severance relationship as a condition for settling the matter, which clearly shows his embezzlement of family property and bullying of widows and orphans. This kind of forced written evidence is not only invalid according to law, but also sufficient to prove his embezzlement of family property. Therefore, it is undoubtedly a violation of Article 335 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, the lawsuit was filed to summon the defendant to court and punish him with</p>
<p>Due Punishment.</p>
<p>And a civil suit was attached, ordering the defendant to return the 40,000 yuan investment and 500,000 yuan in family property. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce presided over the hearing in the Fourth Criminal Court. The defendant did not appear. The plaintiff was represented by lawyer Zhang Shouchun, who stated the above situation. Since the defendant did not appear, he requested an arrest warrant. The court adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Transportation Company Director Arrested for Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Zhang Difan founded the Haida Long Transportation Company at No. 7, Lane 158, Yunnan Road, and hired Sun Jiaxiang, a native of Ningbo, as the business director. At that time, it was agreed that if the business developed in the future, the profits would be split 40/60. However, from August 1st of this year to the 16th of last month, the company suddenly announced a temporary suspension of business before the fourth month of operation. After Zhang Difan audited the accounts, he discovered that Sun Jiaxiang had embezzled more than 1,000 yuan. He immediately reported to the Lao Zha Police Station and requested an investigation. It was not until 6 AM the day before yesterday that Chinese detective Chen Ruisheng arrested Sun Jiaxiang in Room 453 of the East Asia Hotel on Nanjing Road and took him to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court's First Criminal Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, saying that the defendant had embezzled more than 4,000 yuan, which had not yet been fully investigated, and requested permission for detention. Sun Jiaxiang hired lawyer Liu Suxia to defend him in court. Judge Feng ordered Sun to be detained for seven days for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Robber Armed with Damaged Handgun Captured by Brave Victim</h3>
<p>Wang Yujiu (36 years old), a native of Yancheng, has recently been gambling heavily in west Shanghai and is unable to make a living. At 7:30 PM the day before yesterday, he colluded with a fugitive named Tian Hu and gave him a damaged handgun without bullets to rob pedestrians near the intersection of East Broadway Road and Hua Ji Road. After a while, Shui Chongjiu (44 years old), a native of Ningbo, wearing an overcoat, staggered over. Wang Yujiu stepped forward and stopped him, took out the handgun, told him to be quiet, and ordered him to take off the overcoat. Shui Chongjiu was quite brave and took the opportunity to punch the right hand of the robber holding the gun. The handgun fell to the ground. Shui Chongjiu was about to arrest him, but Wang fled. As a result, Wang was captured with the help of a passerby, Mao Acai, along with the handgun without bullets, and handed over to the patrolling Chinese police, who took him to the Huishan Police Station. The head of the police station ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case and said that the accomplice who was at large could not be arrested and requested an extension. After questioning Wang, Judge Huang Risheng ordered him to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing for seven days.</p>
<h3>Shen Quanyu Extortion Case: Hearing Continues Yesterday; Defendants Deny Charges</h3>
<p>On the 18th of last month, the French police, based on a report from Shen Quanyu (nicknamed "Xiao Diao Li"), a local resident of No. 10, Ren He Li, Hongqiao Road, said that his fellow villagers, Qin Haixiang and Shen Huixin, had extorted 500 yuan from him and agreed to pay the money at the Xu Jia Hui Yi Le Tian Tan Huang Yard at about 5 PM that afternoon. After receiving the report, the head of the police station sent detectives in disguise and arrested Qin and Shen on the spot. The next day, the mediator, Qu Zengyuan, was also arrested. All three were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation. Yesterday, the hearing continued. First, the plaintiff, Shen Quanyu, appeared in court and testified that Qin and others came to his home and threatened his mother, saying that if he did not pay the money to settle the matter, they would take drastic measures against him. Therefore, he asked his uncle-in-law, the third defendant, Qu Zengyuan, to mediate with Qin and others. When questioned, the defendant Qin Haixiang testified that the plaintiff, Shen Quanyu, had been acting as an informant in a certain area. Because he had served as an officer in the National Army, he was reported to a certain area by Shen at Xinzhuang Town in West Shanghai last summer and was arrested. Fortunately, his family found a way to release him, but in the meantime, he had spent more than 1,000 yuan. Therefore, this time he came to Shanghai to ask him to compensate for the loss. The third defendant, Qu Zengyuan, testified that the plaintiff was his nephew and that his mother had asked him to mediate because he had a feud with Qin and others. He did not know anything else and hired lawyer Shen Zongyong to defend him and requested bail. After reviewing the statements, the court adjourned the hearing to a later date and ordered the defendants to be returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Two Women Fight Over a Girl: Biological Mother Wants to Take Her Back</h3>
<p>Sun Wangshi, a local woman living in Xiaotaoyuan, Xujiahui, West Shanghai, gave birth to a girl nine years ago. After raising her for six months, she planned to send her to the Sacred Mother's Convent of the Catholic Church. Later, through an introduction, she was adopted by Huang Heshi (48 years old this year), a woman from Taizhou who was a fresh egg vendor at No. 4, Dyeing Mill Lane, Xujiahui, as her adoptive daughter and named Shuying, who is now ten years old. This matter has been going on for nine and a half years. Six years ago, the girl's biological mother, Sun Wangshi, suddenly reported to the police station that her grandson was missing and then suddenly requested the case to be closed after finding him. Until recently, Sun Wangshi suddenly asked Huang Heshi to take the girl back for upbringing. After Heshi refused, the two sides clashed and quarreled, and both reported to the French police, requesting an investigation. After the head of the police station sent detectives to investigate, he summoned both parties and the girl to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday afternoon, and the police lawyer filed a lawsuit according to law. According to Sun Wangshi, she initially fostered the girl with Shi and now wants to take her back. According to Huang Heshi, she adopted the girl through an introduction, paid ten yuan for breastfeeding fees, and has witnesses to testify to this. She also brought the witness to court. After a detailed interrogation by Judge Zhu Chuzhe, he ruled in court that the girl, Huang Shuying, should be allowed to be taken back by Huang Heshi. If Sun Wangshi wants to take the girl back, she should file a confirmation lawsuit with the Civil Court of this court.</p>
<h3>Trolley Hits Rickshaw Puller; Driver Faints from Fright</h3>
<p>At 10:30 AM yesterday, a No. 188 Route 14 trolleybus ran over a rickshaw puller on Jing'an Temple Road and Seymour Road, injuring him. The driver was probably overly frightened and drove the bus onto the sidewalk at the intersection of Seymour Road and Weihaiwei Road. At the same time, the driver fainted in his seat and lost consciousness. Later, an ambulance was called to take the driver to the hospital for treatment.</p>

The East China Sea is cloudy to partly cloudy with localized rainfall and a fairly strong winter monsoon. Also, in the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in Shanghai was 50.7 and the lowest was 31.1.

<p>Gambling Den "Supervision Department" Orders: Japanese Forbidden from Entering Gambling Dens. All Gambling Dens Posted the Order Yesterday. "Transactions" with Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese Prohibited. Violators Will Have Gambling Den Licenses Revoked</p>
<p>According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, the "Entertainment Venue Supervision Department" in charge of the gambling dens in West Shanghai issued an order yesterday (the 10th) stating that from now on, Japanese, Koreans, and Taiwanese are not allowed to gamble in the gambling dens. Any gambling den that "transacts" with such people will have its license revoked immediately. All gambling dens in West Shanghai have posted this order. Some gambling dens have written the order in large characters on red paper and pasted it on the door. It is believed that the "Supervision Department" issued this order as a direct result of the Zhao Feng General Assembly shooting incident on November 26th. On that day, three Japanese special agents entered the Zhao Feng General Assembly and lost three or four thousand gold, which led to a conflict with the gambling den operators. They pulled out guns and opened fire. Immediately, the Japanese military police arrived at the scene and took the three Japanese away. The Zhao Feng General Assembly was temporarily closed, and the license was returned on Saturday and Sunday. The license fee for the Zhao Feng General Assembly has been increased from 150 yuan to 300 yuan per day.</p>

<h3>Writing Under the Lamp</h3>
<p>— Qin Lao</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Although the Danish philosopher Kierkegaard is famous as a mystic, he always used sharp language to criticize the society before him thoroughly. I saw the following passage in the German "Kierkegaard Aphorism Collection" ("So Spricht Soren Kierkegaard") compiled by R. Dolinger:</p>
<p>The so-called era, as a whole, is revolutionary, completely wanting to start from the beginning and abandon tradition... But look, in daily life, in actual life, the people who form the current era all regard calling for the rescue of tradition as the highest ideal, and this ideal is extremely difficult to abandon. For example, merchants post advertisements in newspapers every day, hoping to gain the traditional power that cannot be obtained without decades from repeated events.</p>
<p>This situation is everywhere. Yes! It can be said that our era's commerce and trade actually follow tradition through ingenious methods.</p>
<p>Thus, what people think is this: to leave that kind of ancient tradition that is already useless, and hope to establish as quickly as possible a tradition that serves as a substitute, that is, a tradition that is put into practice through ingenious methods.</p>
<p>People think they are revolutionary and hate everything called tradition. - But collectivism pushes a kind of tradition to the masses in the shortest possible time, precisely to show revolution. - Note how convenient this tradition is for this so-called benefactor of mankind!</p>
<p>This saying seems a little obscure, but it is really very profound. This phenomenon is everywhere before our eyes, and there is no need to cite examples. According to Kierkegaard, everything that maintains tradition through ingenious methods is the behavior of merchants. But truly speaking, this meaning is not excessive. Let's look at the gentlemen who are currently using many ingenious explanations to get young people to read "Classical Chinese". Is it actually for the sake of business?</p>
<p>In the same book, there is another passage:</p>
<p>In what was written by the Jewish swindler Didler, I read the story of the robber from Berlin that was very widespread - that is, one of the Ribendahl family. He was Jewish and was originally a pickpocket, but because he was not doing very well, he made a great oath to God under the fair "Heavenly Realm" (for the Jews, the so-called "Heavenly Realm" is of particular significance, at least Didler said so), saying: He would never do pickpocketing again no matter what. He kept his covenant - but in an instant he went to be a robber. When he came out of prison again, he prayed to God again, vowing never to be a robber again. - But this time he went to be a swindler.</p>
<p>Although this is said of the Jews, it has nothing to do with our current fashionable "anti-Semitism". The focus is only on explaining this kind of stereotype. But I don't know if it's because I'm nervous, but I always feel like this is operating on the bodies of some of our constantly changing celebrities and writers.</p>
<h3>Language Small Stories</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yu</p>
<p>Words in Heaven</p>
<p>Adam learned to speak in Heaven, but what language did he learn? This is a big question, and one that has tormented many "scholars."</p>
<p>St. Jerome said: "All documents prove that Hebrew, in which the Old Testament was written, is the earliest language of mankind." If that were the case, there wouldn't be much to say; but later, as various national languages arose, everyone wanted to trace their own language back to Heaven, and disagreements emerged.</p>
<p>Goropius said Dutch was the language of Heaven. Kempe disagreed, saying that in Heaven, God spoke Swedish to Adam, and Adam replied in Danish, while the hateful serpent spoke French to Eve. Erro, in his great work "The Primitive World," said Basque was the language of Adam. Eastern Christians have a different view. According to the "opinion" of the Persians, Adam and Eve spoke Persian, the Archangel spoke Turkish, and the serpent spoke Arabic.</p>
<p>The "pluralistic theory" has one drawback: with such disunity in the language of Heaven, conversations would probably be very difficult. However, in our judgment, the true meaning of "pluralism" is to promote the excellence of one's own language and despise foreign languages.</p>
<p>Each Has Its Specialty</p>
<p>The Chinese believe that Suzhou dialect is for women, Beijing dialect is for men, Ningbo dialect is for merchants, and Yangzhou dialect is for laborers, each with its own specialty. Foreigners also have their ideas: women speak Italian, men speak French, birds speak English, horses speak German, and God speaks Spanish. I would like to ask you all, can you use the English you have learned to talk to birds? If so, then Gongye Chang would not be able to spread his fame abroad.</p>
<p>The specialty of languages was particularly evident in ancient India, where women spoke Prakrit and privileged men spoke Sanskrit. Such language prohibitions are still prevalent among today's barbarians.</p>
<p>When the Caribs occupied the Small Antilles, they killed all the men, leaving only women for reproduction. As a result, the languages of men and women became completely different. Women understood the men's language, but never spoke it, and vice versa. Therefore, sons spoke the men's language, and daughters spoke the women's language. So, the phrase "my father" was Noukouchili when a woman said it, Voumaan when a man said it, and Baaba when they said it together. The Chiquitos also do this: men have three ways of saying "go home": Yebotu ti n-ipoostu (he goes to his home), Yebotu ti ipoos (he goes to her home), and Yebo ti n-ipoostu (she goes to his home); but women only have one way of saying it, which is Yeboti n-ipoos (she goes to her home). Among the Warramunga Aborigines of Australia, even widows are forced to use sign language.</p>
<p>Save the Women!</p>
<h3>Children of the Motherland</h3>
<p>— Shu Xi</p>
<p>On the roadside, I met Qing, who told me some news; joy filled my heart, yes, I should see them off.</p>
<p>Stepping onto the stone steps, I walked into an artist's studio. They reached out their warm hands and shook mine tightly.</p>
<p>"Friends! Have you decided to leave?"</p>
<p>"Yes, we are going to throw ourselves into the embrace of the Motherland!" This powerful answer was filled with boundless excitement and determination. I gazed at their radiant faces; hanging on the wall were several bold and unrestrained oil paintings in the style of P. Cezanne and V. Gogh, light, heat, and power filled my surroundings, and I forgot that it was a cold dusk.</p>
<p>There were no rich people's delicacies, fine wine, and beautiful women, just a small square table, nine people sitting close together, a few plates of melon seeds, peanuts, cakes, biscuits, and a few cups of tea. This was the farewell banquet prepared by Teacher Yan for them, but in these refreshments, everyone tasted the supreme teacher-student warmth!</p>
<p>Teacher Wang was the oldest of them, and he said: "I am very happy about your departure! Yes, young people, if you don't contribute to the Motherland at this time, when will you wait! Speaking of which, I am also ashamed..." You have broken away from this cage, and you can breathe deeply the free and fresh air. There, everywhere is filled with a great and magnificent picture...</p>
<p>I couldn't say anything, I silently thought to myself, in the wandering life, long years have passed, and now I am trapped in this cage again, for life? But living in this dark gray shadow...</p>
<p>Teacher Yan earnestly exhorted them, encouraging them—this loving mother!</p>
<p>"Have you told your parents about your departure this time?" Teacher Wang asked Shao Fei with concern, a young man who had been married for a short time and had a wealthy family.</p>
<p>"I have told them; they all said, 'Child! You belong to the Motherland!'..."</p>
<p>Everyone's palms clapped loudly, counting as a glorious and exciting answer to him.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, I had to leave first. On the way back, the sharp north wind was blowing, but enthusiasm still lingered in my heart. I silently recited Shelley's lines: "If winter comes, can spring be far behind!..." I bless them.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Ye Zi</h3>
<p>— Zhi Jing</p>
<p>News came that Mr. Ye Zi passed away on October 5th in his hometown of Yiyang County, Hunan.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Zi was very young, but his life was difficult and multifaceted. Regarding his experience, Mr. Lu Xun said, "It is worth a century of experience for peaceful people in a peaceful world." He saw, encountered, and heard many things, and he used a not-very-flexible pen to write about the yin and yang sides of the world, showing the arrogance, meanness, filth, and oppression of one world..., and the submissiveness, endurance, tragic fate, struggle, and resistance of another world...</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun edited the Slave Series, with his short story collection "Harvest" as the initial offering. These three hundred-plus pages are full of "fire-like enthusiasm, and a pile of blood and tears reality." In terms of technique, the author rationally admitted, "It lacks artistic elements too much," "For the grasp of characters, and the insertion of stories, often appear clumsy," "Some places are described too much, and described too little." However, the substantial content makes readers feel grief and indignation, and does not feel that there are major shortcomings; moreover, our author is still young, he "can humbly accept all well-intentioned criticism," he "can painstakingly, diligently and continuously learn," he wants to "maintain the original enthusiasm, strengthen the cultivation of technology and the experience of life" in the effort to contribute "decent things" (a modest expression), but now he has died with unfulfilled ambitions.</p>
<p>Indeed, he had planned to write a grand work reflecting the revolution of the motherland, "The Sun Rises from the West," and was buried in work in poverty and illness to make it appear, but Heaven did not grant him long life, and ruthlessly took away his life, which should be deeply regretted by us literary searchers.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Zi's death left him destitute and in need of assistance. Colleagues in the literary and art circles in Hong Kong, Xia Yan, Li Bo, Yu Feng, Ai Wu, Yang Gang, Dai Wangshu, Xin Pi, and Xi Ru, launched a fundraising campaign to support his family. In Shanghai, there should be no shortage of Mr. Ye Zi's friends, in order to commemorate him and let this cultural warrior rest in peace, please extend your hands to fulfill some responsibility. (Fundraising to support the family of Mr. Ye Zi)</p>
<h3>By the Chuanchang River</h3>
<p>— Yi Xiang</p>
<p>We spread enthusiasm by the Chuanchang River,</p>
<p>Let the scorching sun burn at noon,</p>
<p>The crystal clear river silently soothes the shadows of the willows,</p>
<p>Let the fiery heat melt away, we are soaked with sweat,</p>
<p>Fervent hearts strive for a truth,</p>
<p>"Should we let the shadows of life stain our hearts?"</p>
<p>We hate the meanness of life,</p>
<p>Grinding our teeth, we won't allow man to eat man!</p>
<p>Joy!</p>
<p>The power of the farmers leaps on the earth,</p>
<p>Children are stars, shining in all directions in the sky;</p>
<p>We sow the seeds of new life,</p>
<p>Listening to a string of living songs behind us.</p>
<p>We marvel at the poetic sunset by the Chuanchang River,</p>
<p>Watching the silver flow of the moon swaying in the heart of the Chuanchang River,</p>
<p>Our hearts fly to the innocence of ancient times,</p>
<p>The singing of the times resounds;</p>
<p>In the distance, the lights of Xichang twinkle.</p>

<h3>A Pilgrimage to Dahua</h3>
<p>— Le</p>
<p>The official opening of the Dahua Grand Theater today is a glorious chapter in the history of maritime entertainment this year. Dahua's predecessor was originally "Summer Pick," one of the first theaters to show sound films. For various reasons, it closed for many years. During this process, we passed by the entrance and couldn't help but sigh! Now, this quiet and desolate courtyard has been transformed into a magnificent palace of art, and it will attract thousands of movie fans in an active posture, which is indeed a gratifying and congratulatory thing.</p>
<p>On the eve of the opening, I made a special pilgrimage. Within half an hour, all the new equipment was in sight, and I deeply admired the greatness of the contributions of the designers. In terms of temperature, general theaters are often overheated in winter and too cold in summer, which has a negative impact on the human body. Dahua is equipped with a new type of air conditioner to control the cold and heat, extracting dirty air and delivering fresh and clean air; in terms of light, Dahua uses a newly invented "hole-free sky view" screen, so the light is bright and soft, and will not damage the audience's eyes; in terms of sound equipment, Dahua uses the new Wenzier "Ace" projector, which has no drawbacks of uneven light intensity or broken film interruptions; "sound, light, and seat" are all three beautiful, which is really rare.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that the Dahua authorities can, in addition to this kind of excellent equipment, also match it with careful selection of films, thoughtful service, low prices, and acceptance of audience opinions...I believe the future is very promising.</p>
<h3>Saving the Orphan of Zhao (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>In his later years, when Tan Xinpei occasionally performed the role of Cheng Ying in this play, he always paired with Jia Honglin as Gongsun Chujiu and Huang Jianfu as Tu Anjia. The combination was seamless and popular. However, I have not heard of him performing the revenge scene. Based on the aforementioned singing by Wang Yutian, I know that Lao Tan must have performed it, and it was very famous at the time. It was probably before the Republic of China, at the end of the Guangxu era. Lao Tan formed his own Tongqing Troupe and performed it at Zhonghe Garden. Because Wang's singing fully imitated Tan's style, Wang would not have had this singing if Tan had not had this scene. (I have a recording of Wang singing this, and it has the most flavor of Tan's style.) In the Pi Huang troupes, the martial old men who perform Lu'an Zhou mostly do not include the broken arm storytelling of the Eight Great Hammers to return to the clan, while those who perform Wang Zuo's broken arm all include the viewing of paintings to return to the clan. Returning to the origin is very popular. Today, performing "Saving the Orphan of Zhao" without including the revenge scene is truly a regret. I advocate that this kind of excellent play can be arranged as a complete play, and even if it is not arranged as a complete play, it must include the viewing of paintings and revenge; otherwise, the audience will not know whether the orphan is alive or not, and whether the great revenge has been avenged or not. Old actors may have this complete script, or else seek it from the Beijing opera circles. If you can't find it, you can refer to historical sites and the Kunqu opera "Eight Heroes" to rewrite it. I feel that this kind of work is not difficult; the government is now promoting the Eight Virtues, and Cheng Ying and Gongsun's rescue of the orphan is a great virtue. The spirit of loyalty and righteousness, and the nature of perseverance, are rare in ancient times and are enough to encourage the present world. They only saved the life of one orphan, and were able to risk their lives and persevere without complaint. If we extend this, we can save society and save the country. Shouldn't we pursue and emulate this spirit of sacrificing life for righteousness and killing oneself for benevolence? Moreover, performing it as a drama, performing it as a popular Erhuang opera, would be deeply moving. Therefore, this kind of good play should be vigorously promoted, so I do not hesitate to spend my words and speak at length about it.</p>
<p>The tombs of Cheng Ying and Gongsun Chujiu are located in Zhao Village, Taiping County, Jiangzhou, Shanxi Province. They were found by officials of the Hedong Road in the Song Shenzong Dynasty, who were ordered to do so. Cheng Ying was posthumously named Marquis of Chengxin, and Gongsun Chujiu was posthumously named Marquis of Zhongzhi. A temple was ordered to be built in Jiangzhou, and sacrifices were made annually. The supervisor of the temple construction was the Jinshi Wu Chuhou. Because the imperial succession in the Shenzong Dynasty was repeatedly vacant, and Prince Yun was often ill, Chuhou submitted a memorial stating that the Zhao clan of this dynasty was actually a descendant of Zhao Wuzi of the Jin State (i.e., the Orphan of Zhao). If it were not for the rescue of Cheng Ying and Gongsun Chujiu at that time, the Zhao clan would have had no survivors, and there would be no foundation for the Song Dynasty today. Because the ancestors of Zhao Kuangyin, the founding emperor of the Song Dynasty, were all born in Hebei and were descendants of Zhao Wuling's father, Zhao Wu, the tenth generation grandson. Zhao Wu once wore mourning clothes for Cheng Ying for three years and built a shrine to worship him. Today, the shrine and tomb are no trace, and the sacrificial rites have been missing for a long time. The ghosts of the two have nowhere to return, and I am afraid that they are causing harm. It is appropriate to seek their tombs and temples, and add a special feudal title to repay their merits, so that loyalty and righteousness will be encouraged, and the succession will be prosperous. See Wu Chuhou's own "Qingxiang Miscellaneous Records." The tombs and temples of Cheng Ying and Chujiu were built because of Wu's request, and feudal titles were also granted. This matter is little known in society, so I hereby explain it.</p>
<h3>Guohua Film News</h3>
<p>— Yixin</p>
<p>"Hero in a Chaotic World" is scheduled to start production within a day. The battle scenes are very grand. The actors have been taught by martial arts experts and have martial arts skills. Every punch, kick, knife, and spear has a solution, which is different from the random fighting of ordinary martial arts films. The prison break scene is extremely tense.</p>
<p>"Dong Xiaowan" is about to start filming immediately. The sets, costumes, and props have been carefully researched and cost more than 30,000 yuan. The lead actress, Zhou Xuan, is reading the script day and night.</p>

<p>Guan Dayuan Excels in Performing Old Plays such as Yong'an Palace and Hanyang Courtyard</p>
<p>From here onwards, it is about the Former Lord recovering in Yong'an Palace, not far from entrusting his son. The Former Lord dreamed of Guan Yu and Zhang Fei appearing as spirits, cried bitterly and woke up, and then there was a scene of crying at the spirit tablet, with two grand sections of tragic and desolate "Fan Xipi" added in the middle, recounting the three men's great defeat of the Yellow Turbans, the three battles with Lu Bu, and Guan Yu and Zhang Fei's martial strategies, etc. The tone was sad and could make listeners feel sorrowful. This is the characteristic of "Fan Xipi." It is a mistake for people to think that "Fan Xipi" started with Lao Tan. Later, the Former Lord's illness worsened, and Zhuge Liang came to Baidi City from Sichuan to accept the Former Lord's entrustment of his son. At that time, Ma Su was at his side, and his words offended the Former Lord, so he slapped Ma Su's face and said to Kongming, "Ma Su's words are exaggerated and ultimately useless." This is the origin of Kongming's line in "Empty City Stratagem," "...When the Late Emperor entrusted his son, he said..." However, the actor who plays Ma Su in the play is not a martial role, but a small clown, wearing a black headscarf, a green open robe, and small pendants, which is very different from the dress in "Empty City Stratagem." It is said that this play is the old script of Yu Sansheng, the grandfather of Shu Yan. Dayuan learned opera from the famous teacher Jia Lichuan (Jia Honglin's uncle) when he was young, and Lichuan's family had many old scripts, so Dayuan obtained this secret transmission.</p>
<p>(2) Hanyang Courtyard This play is also known as Crying for Liu Biao. The tune of crying is also Fan Xipi. This kind of tune is rare in the play. Some people say that this is the reverse tune of Erliu, and the interlude accompaniment is similar. The end of the Erliu sentence often goes to a high note, while the end of each sentence of Fan Xipi is low and slow, so the above statement is quite reasonable. However, what is puzzling is why this kind of tune is only used by Liu, the Former Lord, for crying "..." Crying "...". Is it because Liu Bei is an expert at crying, so he is specially allowed to enjoy the exclusive right? Not only is Dayuan good at performing the play Hanyang Courtyard, but he also taught it to Lian Liang, which shows that he is very humble and amiable, and not like those selfish people who hide good scripts and refuse to pass them on.
