<p>社評</p>
<h3>國際現象與英國</h3>
<p>國際兩大陣綫的搏鬥，跟着時日而演進。由於反侵略陣綫樹立的延滯，侵略集團方面尤其呈現着囂張跋扈的聲勢。在遠東，東京談判於狂熱的反英運動中舉行，要英國不戰而屈服，在中東歐，希特勒一面蓄意攫取但澤，威脅波羅的海諸小國，一面又發動國內的報章雜誌，猛烈攻訐英國；在地中海，西班牙以外援而勝了內訌，本已備受挾制了，最近義大利外長齊亞諾的訪問弗朗哥，目的顯在加緊對它的控制，而在軍略地位上予英國以進一步的威脅；同時，黑衣宰相的代言人蓋達連對那名存實亡的英義協定，也揚言要加以廢棄了。這一切，同時演爲方面不同的三種攻勢、決不是偶然的局部的事情，而是有機的聯合的戰略。東京談判中狂大的討價，希望壓迫英國在波蘭或地中海問題上對德義讓步；而中東歐的危機或地中海的波浪，又無疑可以抬高日本在談判中勒索的條件。這裏最可注意的，是三方面的攻勢都以英國爲共同的直接的對象。這很明白，不因為英國力量最弱，而因爲英國最富妥協性，最易使之屈服啊。</p>
<p>目前國際危機的銳化，當然不是突然發生的，而是歐洲大戰以後，英國與其他民治國虛浮逸樂，畏難茍安的後果；到了「九一八」，英國竟然拒絕了美國的提議，到了一九三七年，英國又手訂了慕尼黑協定，於是侵略氣燄昂進了，國際危機延長擴大了。在遠東，侵略者無所忌憚而南北並進，佔領海南島新南羣島，完成了太平洋上的初步佈局，進而威脅英法美的利益；在歐洲，捷克共和國從地圖上消失，米美爾被併吞，西班牙共和國被染上法西斯的顏色，阿爾巴尼亞被滅亡，希特勒又繼承威廉第二而跨上了東進的野馬（向近東），地中海將因弗朗哥將軍扼守大門而成為黑衣宰相的「內湖」。這種事實的教訓，使張伯倫知道改弦易轍的必要，開始建立反侵略陣綫，會同法國，先後拉攏了波蘭羅馬尼亞和土耳其，並且與蘇聯談判互助。不幸因爲英國放棄綏靖政策的誠信未立，蘇聯往年推行國際政策的恐佈，依稀瀰漫於波羅的海沿海以及歐洲其他各小國之間；而蘇聯對英復用拗執而冷淡的手腕，逐步深入，以試探英國對蘇聯妥協的最大限度；因此種種，英蘇談判至今陷於僵局；國際反侵略陣綫最重要的一環，至今不能建立；而侵略集團尤因此而肆其奔突。</p>
<p>在東西侵略惡浪的猛烈襲擊之下，操舵的張伯倫先生究將何以自處？據路透電傳，張氏前天在下院演說，對於日本「壓迫英國改變遠東政策」的企圖，已加以明白拒絕的答覆；其次，英國重要軍事領袖埃恩賽德氏，已行抵華沙，進行返侵略陣綫國的軍事談話；再次，倫敦當局正與南保兩國代表，進行外交談話，據傳至少亦希望南保兩國不爲侵略集團所利用；同時，倫敦已發出新訓令，由英國駐蘇大使繼續進行那跡近僵凍的英法蘇三國談話。從上述幾點看來，可知國際新危機的襲來，使張伯倫由刺激而前進，這是可喜的現象。我們所不能安心的，英國對於空虛的形式的國際主義，中毒已深，幾乎因此而喪失其國家的獨立政策，與民族的新銳之氣；故刺激以後的前進姿態，仍有等待國際的所謂共同動作與謂平行行動而趦趄徘徊的可能。而蘇聯的冷酷，美國國內政情的不安，尤足使沒有決心者氣餒。其實趦趄徘徊無異獎惡，不但前功盡棄，抑且後患無窮；鼓勇前進則不但以英國的實力所在而足使羣魔遁形，抑且國際以共通利害所在決不坐視英國的始終獨受犧牲。中國獨力抗戰已經兩年，國際同情的援助與日俱增；假使英國能獨力邁進於反侵略的前綫，則不論法土波羅諸國的立即以全力爲之後盾，即其他國家亦和竭誠援助。英國似乎有所期待於美國與蘇聯，但以我們的觀察，惟有英國的積極昂進，纔是策動美國與蘇聯的最有效方法！</p>
<h3>政府維持法幣　政策並無變更　財部發言人之談話</h3>
<p>（重慶）關於近日上海外匯風潮、財政部發言人今日發表下列之談話、</p>
<p>中國政府對於法幣，仍係本其原定之維持、以合乎國家經濟、及能自由供給合法貿易之幣制政策、此點財部已屢有聲明發表、迄今並無變更、自戰事爆發以來、政府曾力予合法貿易、以外匯上之便利、在民國二十七年三月以前、外滙均能根據政府所定之匯兌率自由買賣、但自三月以後、因日本主持下之僞華北準備銀行成立、政府對於外滙之管理上不能不加以限制、但對於必要之外匯、仍設法照撥、其後日本破壞法幣之企圖更層出不窮、除發行大批日幣軍用券、及僞華北聯合準備銀行紙幣外、又發行所謂僞華興銀行紙幣、因之紙幣之流通額驟增、而中國之幣價問題、亦以轉趨複雜、此外日方更以由人民收沒之法幣、與海關之收入、及用其他方法、在日軍佔據區內榨取法幣、換取外匯、同時又以收買或以僞幣購買之方法、吸收大批中國之出口貨物、轉而換取外匯故在平時足敷各方需要之外匯數量、因以轉趨減少、同時又有非必需之物品、大批輸入國內、其中大部均係運至淪陷區內、政府最近雖曾下令禁止此種物品入口、然而輸入者仍源源不絕、其中且有一部份係轉供日軍需用者、按中國之主要貿易、原爲國內商務、其數量遠超過對國外之貿易、敵人侵略行爲、及投機者操縱所造成匯兌價格下降之現象、均屬遺憾、然吾人購進外貨之困難、以及暫時外匯價格下跌之現象、對於中國整個之經濟狀況、並不發生嚴重影響、猶憶十年以前、美元之價值曾一度低於中國銀元、每一英鎊亦僅約折合中國國幣四元、但當時英美二國並不因此而顯×××狀、中國政府爲便利各方向國外購取其最需要之物品起見、仍將繼續准撥大批外匯本月初旬政府所公布之措置及其目的、不但在使人民得購進其最切需之物品、及增加中國之生產力、以應目前之需求、同時且可因而促進本國出口貨物之生產、及鼓勵商人增加輸出貿易、政府所公布之各項措置、現均已逐一實施、其結果亦將增強國家之經濟力、即所以增強其抗戰力也云云、（十九日電）</p>
<p>（東京）據今午此間消息、「華興銀行」副總裁鷲尾、現正在東京、與外務省「中國局」商議、決定不顧一切、將「華興銀行」之紙幣、維持英鎊六辦士之匯價、以期該項紙幣能在華中方面流通、（十九日美聯社電）</p>

<h3>金融最是黃金心可愛　爭將鈔票換黃金　遂以三二〇〇元之高價收盤　若照外匯核算尚撳低四百元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、雖外匯緊勢已漸見緩和、但金市則仍狂漲不已、農間即橫跳九十五元開盤、至晚收竟再造三千二百元驚人空前頂高峰、中途雖呈盤旋之狀態、究屬漲多跌少、蓋上日經本市富商及外行搜購既烈、且捏住不放、今再加碼拖進、故市面籌碼更現實枯竭、結果又猛漲一百四十五元、然以匯劉貼水高漲、鈔票不易多得、進者尚難如願活動、否則漲勢之烈、更難遏止也、故目前根據外匯核算、在三千五百五十元至六百元之間、照本日之金價、尚撳低四百元光景、交易暢旺、全天約二千餘兩、銀樓飾金亦隨之猛漲十五元、創見三百二十五元之空前紀錄、海關金仍平、中英純金等復尚下降、</p>
<p>烚赤籌碼枯竭再漲一百十五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初時因聞外匯匯豐祗肯照掛牌價維持、因之人心更監、賣戶多懷觀望、然買方竟喊三千一百元、時某金號代投機商加碼猛進心切、放高五十元、始由銀樓幫售予五十兩、價三千一百元、較上日竟又猛跳九十五元、幾而又吸收錢兌業五十兩、價一百五十元、後某錢兌業代客幫獲利吐售、價順撳小十餘元、某錢兌業賣予同業五十兩、價一百三十八元為當日低價、時間英金又逼達五便士關口、業匯復破入十元關內、致買風重起、某銀行樓及錢兌業猛進、雖有銀樓幫與現金號等吐售、奈頭寸仍感求過於供、致價逐步高昂、時某金號代投機商亦起吸收、漲屬更厲、錢兌業進銀樓幫五十兩、價竟高達一百七十五元、此後買方因聞外匯轉穩、且有聞匯劉貼水飛漲、已達一百六十餘元、故進意遂稍形淡薄、錢兌業與散戶亦爭先出籠、致即回降二十餘元、金號塞予錢兌業五十兩、價一百五十元、午刻情勢又監、錢兌業進金號五十兩、一百六十元為午收價、午後某金號與某銀號等納胃均佳、放盤吸收、致處於買風籠罩下、再漲起三十元、銀樓幫賣予金號五十兩、價一百九十元、嗣錢兌業代浮多吐出、售予某金號百五十兩、一度低至一百七十八元、但不旋踵某銀樓買意復萌、價一霎那竟跳起十餘元、某銀樓進金號五十兩、價一百九十一元、延至晚收、某錢兌業進金號五十兩、價三千二百元為空前新高峯、結果比上日積猛漲一百四十五元、查已連漲二天、共漲五百八十一元之巨、全日有六十二元高低、至現金號之本牌金隨時照烚赤價約高十元左右、收進須減十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、據詢鮮有成交、</p>
<p>飾金跟漲十五元　進出價相去愈遠</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初均未更、迨至十時許、因烚赤開高九十餘元、故亦猛漲十元、後至三十一刻、又掛高五元、共漲十五元、計大同行改懸三百二十五元、新同行為三百二十三元、為有市以來之空前紀錄、而收進價因烚赤近日漲落、波浪太大，且收進師物、照例須待七天後方可熔化、故同業一致均照兌出價減低十餘元至念元不等</p>
<p>英鎊堅昂純金每盎斯回小半便士</p>
<p>十八日倫敦電、英純金因英鎊堅昂、故沒盎斯回小半便士、計退達七鎊八先令五便士半、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦降低至一千二百元九角、掛牌海關金仍平、計二元三角九分六厘、上海標準標金價亦隨跌四角、計一千二百〇七元二角、</p>
<h3>洋行仍在扒結　外匯繼續緊縮　美匯已進十元關</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、匯豐掛牌揭曉、英平美積縮零二五、又創見九元六八七五之空前紀錄、其餘除印港兩匯勿動外、亦再發現新低價、英美匯暗市、始亂終平、情勢轉定、初開照隔昨晚收價不動、顧匯豐祗允照掛牌價（英金五辦士、美匯九元七五）維持、故此時實為有行無市、迨至九時三十分、才有做開、因油洋行美孚及亞與英美煙公司等、忽願衣掛牌價扒吸、故匯豐頗有塞出、市勢遂平、雖扒者並未間歇、但其時港電突來吐售、且其他外行等賣意亦隨之稍濃、故情勢更見穩定、至午收未變、惟結果繼續見軟、美匯破入十元關內、而七八月期貨、售者鑒於現貨市勢如此、均不敢輕易拋出、故愈遠愈緊、是以掉期相軋越開、現貨與八月英金須差縮半辦士、美金差縮一元、目前七八月掉期月息（除佣）竟達八分二三厘之厚、然經營者仍受現鈔缺乏而束來、故鮮聞成交易、至現貨半天交易、因西商沙遜及某方等大都觀望、故亦甚寥落、港匯銀行賣價、又縮至三十五元、</p>
<p>匯豐掛牌英匯不動</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠均平。紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金縮半辨士、匯兌英對美大二厘二、對滬猛跌九三七五、對法未更、美對英長一二五、對滬暴縮二元五角四分、對法大零六二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金五辨士二五、美匯十元零二五、較隔昨均無榮辱、開後因各大洋行結款繁多、加以英行匯豐、祗肯照隔昨掛牌價（英金計五辦士美匯為九元七五）供給、是以缺乏維持、頓形緊俏、英金立軟至五辦士零六二五、美匯亦緊至九元八七五、但洋行對於上價尚難購結、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉、計英匯勿動、美匯又改縮零六二五、其餘除印港兩匯外、亦積稍掛徽、白銀平衡稅揭曉、依然免徽、此後始開英美煙公司暫其他洋行等相繼購進匯豐、麥加利現貨、金為五辦士、繼而美孚洋行亦結得匯豐某行現貨美匯為九元七五及八一二五、時國外港電突來吐塞、且其他各行賣意亦隨之稍濃、情勢遂轉穩定、計港電與外行華比荷蘭等相繼售予亞細亞與其他洋行現貨英金為五辦士零六二五及零三一二五、時已午刻、至港匯銀行賣價亦軟至三十五元、但鮮聞成交、延年午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金五辦士零三一二五、美匯九元八一二五、本月份英金辦士九零六二五、美匯九元五六二五、八月份英金四辦士五三一二五、美匯八元八一二五、結果較隔昨晚收、現貨英積緊一一一八七五、美亦再縮四三七五、本月份英緊一二八七五、美亦軟四三七五、八月份英約緊三一二五、美約軟六八七五、港　照銀行賣　亦緊二元、午後週三無市、茲將半天做開交易錄後、</p>

<h3>貼現步高</h3>
<p>一度到一六五元　昨匯劉票據貼現率、仍步高不止、每千元初為一百四十元左右、缺少維持、而需求現鈔者殷切、竟飛高二十餘元、午刻達一百六十五元、下午趁高放出者較多、頓見回退至一百五十五元、比前日又高十七元五角、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市均掛一角六分云、</p>
<h3>大條平定　印銀反跌為漲</h3>
<p>十八日倫敦電、銀市印度少數買進、投機家少數賣出、市面平、收盤後仍平、印度照掛牌價續有吸收、大條銀近遠期均無上落、紐約銀電、美現貨仍平、又孟買銀電、印銀堅穩、現貨長九安那、七八月均漲五安那、成交單共計一百五十張云、</p>
<h3>金鎊之聲清脆悅耳　金票之色燦爛奪目　市價暴漲……供應太缺　鮮票獨跌……人心可知</h3>
<p>昨日英純金回跌半辦士、英美匯兌升一二五、本埠外匯、洋行結款甚殷、美孚英美煙公司等均趨吸納、外銀行供給呆鈍、市況甚虛弱、英匯為五辦士〇三一二五、較上日續緊一二八七五、美匯為九元八一二五、續軟四三七五、週三下午無市、烚赤開盤、因匯票續呈緊張、且北幫前次拋出者紛紛補進、市氣堅昂、做三千一百五十元、殷富納胃甚暢、幅多獲利了結頗盛、市況盤旋帶堅、午收為六十元、下午需要復殷、開盤為九十元、終以人心望高、回跌無力、晚收為三千二百元、較上日續漲一百四十五元、外幣英美金榜、供給缺乏、市價狂漲未已、英美金票、多為殷富搜購對藏、無貨應市、市況堅昂、香港票法郎票等、需要俱殷、齊趨堅挺、日金票需要未殷、上升甚微、晚市為一元〇〇五厘、朝鮮票反見慘落、晚市為八角三分八厘、公會交易未做開、昨日市價、英金榜升四元、英金票升二元六角、美金榜升四元五角、美金票升五角七分、香港票升一角二分、法郎票升二分一厘、新加坡票升二角五分、荷蘭票升三角五分、安南票羅比票各升一角五分、坎拿大票升四角、斐律濱票升二角五分、義大利票升八分、德金票升五分、澳金票升三元九角、選擇票升三角、</p>
<h3>糧食　同是風狂雨驟　粉麥赤步亦趨</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日現粉市況、續形堅挺、蓋自外匯猛縮後、風狂雨驟、人心莫不　　、本街內地與客幫零星去化、漸轉活躍、惟整批客腎、則受匯水鈔票貼現種踵之影響、一時尚不易開展、昨日廠盤堅持四元六角半、本客一律均須現鈔、市面形勢由疲而堅、同時行號客囤手中之回籠貨、亦已逐步加緊、比前喊高五六分、大致須售五元以上之價（匯劃）、洋粉因產價合高、價五元一角之匯劃、但買方購買力依然薄弱、可稱有行無市、麵粉今日有二千包、運往天津、又二千包運廈門、</p>
<p>小麥　昨麥市趨勢、亦轉漲風、查來源因颶風淫雨關係、到貨不多、貨方堅於外匯劇變、物價提高、售意一致堅昂、惟日廠未有動辦、僅侍本街與囤戶之垂青、計開蘇州·崑山·丹陽·大橋·等麥共計一千三百餘包、最高價為六元七角三分、又六角八分、至五角八分、比前已回漲一角左右云、</p>
<h3>銷路活躍　米價重見上漲</h3>
<p>國米自隔因金融等問題一度轉機後、昨則人心續昂、本街銷場既屬活躍、而若囤戶更復互相授受、致交易熱鬧異常、同時客販行家特貨都未出樣、中市貨悉乘機推出、喊聲逐步提高、若常錫市粳均開在二十元限錢、高客尖亦依限線、開出十六元、其如常幫宿粳亦開十九元五六角、高薄稻開二十元、河下早晚稻開十九元一二角、較前市皆飛漲半元有奇、杜洋尖埠尖市貨雖屬無多、有限、開價亦升三四角、</p>
<p>客秈　昨日續有內地幫問津外、本街店鋪與囤戶因其價盤比粳低宜、莫不澅先爭辯、雖有洋米新到、而市氣反見活潑、高貨激漲三四角、價低之糙砶與中次機秈、則漲有五六角、全日成交數亦增至五千以上、</p>
<p>洋米　新到之西貢、昨已在市出樣、惟在本客秈飛騰之際、貨主尚圖扳守善價、不願隨市賤脫、因此多未成議、統市祗開西貢二百多包、價二十二元三角及二十二元半連養、</p>
<p>變元　銷場雖仍仍未爽、然各貨俱漲、行情遂被帶高二三角、統計全市成數粳秈有三萬餘包、而各路來源有限、河下無到頭、車輪包子來南帶貨一千二三百包而已、</p>
<h3>證券　處四面楚歌中　公債跌風豈能倖免　統乙慘跌九角　外股買氣幾同消滅</h3>
<p>證券譜盤、昨日市況、突因銀根奇緊、又起跌風、天津事件、英日會議恐無號結果、咸更惴惴於法幣問題、外匯與黃金緊漲不已、涓涓不塞、何異洪流、津鈔運滬、現金之逃避盆烈、公債處於四面楚歌中、一波未平、一波又起、多方愈覺懷然、因此銀根奇緊、某戶因某種原因、被逼而多頭出籍、市價因此忽又趨跌勢、倘本息問題與所傳消息改付匯劃者、猶可維持不墜、甚盼當局中日正式工布也、昨日初開時、永豐買進、聊盆·恒孚略有賣出、市價做小二三月、尚稱平穩、繼以十六號忽有鉅額求售、尤以乙種為多、元大賣出亦步弱、市價乃其跌風、逐步下降、迄無回風、雖盆中·協大尚有需要、而大通順泰仁昌等仍有賣出、故結果比前日忽猛跌一元餘至二元許、成交總數約計七八十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>油市前日受金債暴漲、外匯奇續之影響、致市場價反跌為漲、昨花生油突由香港幫問津、致漲風獨健、比前市暴漲三元、計共成交膠州油五百件、價為三十七元至三十七元五角、又新聽裝油一千七百聽、價為五十元、青皂桶裝油一百二十桶、價自四十七元五角升至四十八元二角、豆油續提六角、計開膠州油四百件、（價詳市價欄）、青歧油三百五十件、煙歧油三百件、天津聽裝油一千餘聽、大連桶油三十桶、神戶來連油五十桶、　二十日出口、豆子運香港一千七百包、生油運香港四百件又一千聽、麻油運香港一百五十聽、運澳門二百聽、豆油運北沙一百十八件、</p>
<h3>紗花　投機集中　紗價頻頻上升　雙馬又創新高價　會達五百念一元</h3>
<p>紗市續升、氣勢依然挺進、蓋以投機商心意購買尤烈、同時華南一帶、香港幫採辦二十支及二一支大發、二三支金鷄·五福·牧羊等紗、胃口仍健、計四百七十包、雲南進十支粗紗一百二十五包、在此人心熱烈之際、市上流言紛紜、皆屬利於多方、買風仍熾、市盤續向高峯推進、二十支雙馬漲力愈強、一般經營者將其作工具、故起伏範圍擴大、最高會達五百二十一元、查六月十九日雙馬最高價為五百十元、茲已漲過十元矣、至於冷門紗交易既缺乏、而售價依舊不起也、</p>
<p>現紗市情、晨初開盤、市場即趨上升、多說匯票仍看縮面、買進者頗不乏人、開價漲三四百元、二十支雙馬栈單價為五百零二元、立刻漲起三元、為零五元、現貨價為五百十元、少頃金子幫及證券幫都來進紗、立刻橫跳、呌價接一連二的上升、二十支雙馬外栈現貨最高價為五百二十一元、栈單價為五百一十元、施以獲利多頭吐出、又復回下三元、迨至收盤稍形回好一二元不等、查半日間成交統計一千四百四十包行情二十支雙馬獨漲十二元、牧羊漲三元半、十支粗紗漲十元、茲將各棉紗九百件運往海防。一百七十件運北海、三百三十五件運廣州灣、二千七百六十件運香港、二十一件運廈門、一百件運天津、八十五件運煙台、三件運青島、惟日紗佔多數、香港　四七〇　汕頭　二五　泉州　三〇　雲南　一二五　溫州　二五　同行　七四五　內地　二〇　統計一、四四〇</p>

<p>中外棉市交易、已見開展、廠房由新裕廠進常隂沙花五百包、價為一百元送廠、比匯票未變動以前漲四五元之講、不過後批同業又成交一百五十包、再加二元、至於外棉同業、亦開始互相賣買、成交四百件、又訊、滬埠外棉交易、自前日匯兌暴縮後、現紗貼率又漲、交易更形靜寂、廠方以調度金融更將困難、前訂購之外棉、一部尚未裝出者、均擬向洋行方面結價、雖印度棉市日來連跌、惟匯兌上之獲得、相抵尚有薄利、每擔約六元左右之數、昨日了結者、已有多起矣、　外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初即呈疲乏之狀、利物浦來電報跌、引起多頭了結、同業茲又以美棉出口津貼問題、遲遲為能解決、對棉市又轉抱觀望態度、續後棉價因棉區氣候轉好、及南方套賣而跌、結果收盤較之上日跌八至十餘磅音、印度棉市平平、連同預測略漲半羅比、埃及及漲八磅音、</p>
<h3>疋頭　匯流交易　布價增加</h3>
<p>布國　外匯再度狂縮、布市即呈緊張狀態、惟現鈔貼現率亦狂抬至空前高價、同業心思雖昂、惟以現鈔頭　缺乏、銀棖奇緊迪、束縛重重、故現鈔售盤各貨均、站住原價、匯劃貨價、都係鈔票栈交價、比前日之價、漲高七·八元之巨、可見人心尚安定、價格過昂、廠方無銷路也、蘇北來源通花又到二百七十三包、今日有棉花九十五件運香港、茲將現棉情形列左、常隂沙一〇二·〇〇同業中進一五〇包匯劃栈交</p>
<p>白　去九七·〇〇同業中進二〇〇件鈔票栈交</p>
<p>普通新特八一·〇〇同業中進二〇〇件鈔票栈交</p>
<p>美種打包一〇一·五〇同業中進一〇〇件匯劃栈交</p>
<p>常隂沙一〇〇·〇〇新裕廠進五〇〇包匯劃送廠</p>
<p>各布售盤一致升漲、色布色斜漲每疋二角半至五角、細布細斜、每疋漲一角至二角半、粗布粗斜漲每疋五分至二角半、惟按貼現率如此高昂、匯劃論價各貨仍較鈔票計價之貨為廉、故昨同業及囤戶擇匯劃七成現鈔三成、各貨採辦較緊、細布細斜粗布各貨二百餘包、粵滇幫辦細斜細布一百包、本街進染丕細斜一百餘包、而現鈔計價各貨成交轉淡、囤戶頗多所存現鈔易得匯劃後囤貨者、色布生意以售盤突昂、暫少成交、本街門市批發、受風雨影響、頗見冷落、</p>
<p>布東　白貨細布細斜、昨以現鈔貼水狂升、客戶進胃轉淡、售盤下降、十二磅龍頭細布一度跌進十四元大關、至午時收盤為十四元一角、本月期十四元二角、蓋聞日商洋行銀根亦緊、為搜羅現鈔計、連續售開青島貨細布價頗緊廉、市上喜鵲牌細布昨十三元六角、花島細布十三元四角、本街同業採納殊黟、秦皇島幫續辦龍頭細布二百包、據同業觀察、如貼水稍能回降、布盤漲勢未足、仍是趨昂耳、</p>
<p>出口　疋頭今日有二十二件運往青島、二十五見運煙台、七十件運天津、二十五件運廈門、一百二十件運香港、三十五件運廣州灣、十五件運北海、五百六十件運海防、</p>
<h3>絲茶　匯率突縮　絲質昂滕　稍帶紊亂之象</h3>
<p>昨日絲市、漲風方與未艾、白廠Ｂ字售開二五六〇元、亦有做為二六八〇元者、但考事實、前者似教可靠、而後者或係較高品級之白廠、絲價紊亂現象、於此可見一般、輯里經上挺亦勁、六個號子麒麟跑馬等級昨做開一四六〇元、計二日來漲起二五〇元、然交易不多、蓋生絲存底已枯、原料前途尚多困難、且法幣未來發展、亦人言人殊、故一般穩健場商、咸觀望對之、國外絲價、美市亦正盤漲、紐約現貨日絲各漲五分、上海絲廣東絲漲三分、近期標準絲漲三分、遠期漲四分、橫濱現貨晨盤跌十五元、收盤漲一元、今次絲價上升、因屬匯儲突縮、故國外無多影響、銷之活躍、則可無疑也、</p>
<h3>綠茶交易清淡</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊綠茶交易、頗形清淡、蓋現市各茶廠家、多因成本太貴、不敢多進、致手中存貨枯薄、品質優良之貨大都有行無市、全是僅祗協和錦隆等行買進中低莊珍眉二百七十餘箱、抽芯珍眉售價自三百零五元至三百二十元、普通珍眉售價自二百五十元至二百六十五元、細針眉售價五十四五元、價仍平定云、</p>

<h3>自杭州灣登陸疾進　新颶風今晨襲滬　風水激盪低處又成澤國　上海與各地航運均停頓　高潮如與颶風相值水患堪憂</h3>
<p>太平洋呂宋島新起之颶風、初時係向正北方向進行、故未足重視、距自前日午後二時、據徐家滙天文台報吿、颶風進行方向、由正北轉於北偏西之趨勢、且風行甚疾、自前日上午六時至當日午後二時之八小時內、疾馳一百二十海哩、始引起注意、昨日上午六時、據徐家滙天文台報吿、颶風已進抵北緯二十六度、東經一百二十五度之處、風力中心、在六十海哩範圍以內、方向突轉向北西疾進、按照上報方位、在琉球羣島之那巴島西面、距滬已祗三百海哩、恰向上海正面襲來、</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、上海於今（十九日）夜及明日（二十日）將在更强烈之風中、並降雨及颶風之例有預兆、蓋颶風正在向滬疾進途中也、自咋（十八日）晨六時至今晨六時、颶風以十八海里之速率前進、若維持此前進率、則預料颶風今夜抵浙江海岸外之杭州灣、聞颶風中心今晨六時進至距北緯二六度東經一二五度、六〇哩以內、風向西北、</p>
<p>懸球警告</p>
<p>江海關　據徐報吿後、於午後二時起即在外灘新關碼頭及威妥瑪路海關碼頭燈塔上、各懸掛黑球一枚、警吿颶風同滬進襲、禁止任何船隻進出浦江、民船帆船、則均駛至浦東陸家嘴江面避風、</p>
<p>迫近上海</p>
<p>昨日午後二時天文台報吿云、颶風已進抵北緯二十七度、東經一百二十四度之處、中心在六十海哩範圍以內、方向仍爲北西、風行甚速、其時颶風距滬巳祗二百八十海哩、繼續向上海疾進、</p>
<p>加懸黑球</p>
<p>比及昨日午後四時天文台報吿、颶風已進抵北緯二十七度、三十、東經一百二十三度四十三處、風力中心仍爲六十海哩範圍以內、向北西或北西偏北方向進行、按照上報方位、颶風距滬已祗、一百六十餘海哩、上海被襲、巳不可免、江海關復於屋頂及咸妥瑪路碼頭、加懸黑球一枚（計各兩枚）、警吿颶風即將襲滬、</p>
<p>八個風力</p>
<p>襲滬颶風、在昨日午後二時時、約有七個至八　個風力、上海自昨日凌晨起、即有旋風陣雨、蓋已受颶風前哨之滋擾、午後風勢益緊、陣雨益密、路上行人稀少、商店營業淸淡、惟交通方面、迄昨晚八時止、尙無顯著之影響、惟浦江情形、頗爲靜止、各種船隻、均停活動矣、</p>
<p>今晨襲滬</p>
<p>颶風如照北西或北　西偏北方、向疾進不變、將於昨日午　夜與今日凌晨間襲滬、又查浦江今日晨前二時至三時間、適有高潮、如與颶風相値、則水位將被掀起、外灘沿江之處、潮水恐將溢岸、而低窪馬路、自必積水成渠也、</p>
<p>航輪停頓</p>
<p>美國　總統輪船公司、柯立芝總統號、自美來滬、因受上决之颶風影響、延遁天抵埠、始於昨日下午二時半進口、停泊十一·十二號浮筒、至滬乘客、巳次第登陸、該輪本擬今晨十時出口、赴香港小呂宋、昨據該公司云、因二决颶風襲滬、爲避免危險起見、如風勢稍殺、改今日下午五時起椗、送客小輪末决下午三時半、由新關碼頭開往、遠東公司哈納輪、首决行駛滬甬綫、已於昨日下午三時許返滬、準於明日（二十一日）晨二决赴甬、故對颶風、不受影饗、海南公司之揚子江輪、昨午由滬開往定海、兼灣岱山三門灣等處、因船小風大、駛至三十一號浮筒停泊、以避颶風、該輪儎有乘客八十餘人、公司乃派小輪至三十一號浮筒、如乘客不願在船等候者、可趁小輪回滬、據聞揚子江輪對乘客伙食、未有充份之準備、諒乘客均須登陸、以待颶風過後、再趁該輪出口、至大英公司蘇旦號郵船、在大沽口遭日軍留難、迄今半月、各情已紀前報、昨日該公司云、現確已解決、該輪已由津來滬、預計今日下午六時可到滬、停泊十三·十四號浮筒、裝儎客貨、定二十一日（星期五）下午三時出口返歐、但昨日颶風襲滬、海面當亦同樣之波及、故是否能準時進口、未可預卜、行駛揚子江下游之各輪、照例須於下午三四時後、始可回滬、但昨日均未進口、今日出口、亦當無輪矣、南北各錢、昨日適無船進口、今日有山東輪從靑島來、澤生輪自香港來、出口有貴生輪赴靑威福津、濟南輪赴厦香港海防、阜生輪赴香港、能吾如期出口、須視今日風勢如何、藍烟囱之晏呑拿（譯音）號、自英國利物浦來滬、今日能吾進口、尙難預料、昨晚海關鐘樓屋頂、仍紅燈二盞高懸、</p>
<p>又成澤國</p>
<p>昨日下午起在風暴雨、又襲本埠、一時風勢驚人、暴雨傾盆、徹夜未停、同時浦江高潮又復上泓、致公共租界法租界內低澤之馬路、均成澤國、廣西路·福州路·浙江路·地豐略·極司斐爾路·霞飛路·薩坡賽路·西門路·馬浪路等地、一片在洋、下午五時四十五分、法大馬路西新橋之電綫一段、突被風吹毀折斷、幸未傷人、旋即經修復、</p>
<p>颶風高潮相值可慮</p>
<p>據上海浚浦局前總工程師查得利博士（英人）之硏究、夏秋季中雖爲颶風襲擊上海機會較多之季候、惟適與浦江發高潮時間相値、則此種巧合之機會並不多、平均十個機會中、祇有一個而已、故明於上項情形、即知上海由颶風激起相當之水患、並不習見、祇數年偶一遘逢而巳、</p>
<p>浦江水流暢利由來</p>
<p>今年浦江水利情形、遠不能與戰時前之情形相侔、浦江之浚浦工作、完全停止、查浦江水流之得暢利、厥由浚浦局終年勤於浚挖工作所致、故漲潮落潮江水能迅速隨潮進退</p>
<p>失浚以後種種不利</p>
<p>茲浦江失浚、已歷兩年之久、水流濡滯、自屬必然，如値颶風掠境、則浦江水位、勢必被風力所激起、地面爲暴雨所凝積之水量、自不克由陰溝迅速吸洩、即吸洩迅速隨潮退瀉、亦必迂緩、此均爲難免之情形、而値得注意也、</p>
<h3>財部再復商會　銅輔幣券在趕印中　分一分五分兩種</h3>
<p>上海市商會、爲本市銅幣奇缺、各界雖用郵票印花替代、終覺不便、經一再電請財部迅籌救濟、並曾奉財都哿電、復以正在趕印輔幣券、茲該會昨又接到財部允電云、支電悉、查滬市銅輔幣奇缺、業經部批准、由中央銀行電飭發行局趕印一分·五分·輔幣券發行、以資救濟在案、仰即知照、</p>
<h3>華北鈔票儘量收兌　外匯昨趨穩定　謠言漸戢市塲人心稍安　惟黃金高漲貼現風又熾</h3>
<p>路透社十九日倫敦電、金融新聞載文評論中國法幣價復見暴落事、謂在短時期後、復容法幣再度落價、足徵中英平準基金今雖未完全吿罄、然巳所餘無多矣、今須視英國是吾準備繼續援助中國之外匯、此間中英金融家對於法幣統跌、至爲疑異、惟法幣之須任令自覓水準、則已爲一般人所認以爲然矣、此項水準、將達何程度、今爲衆所猜測之事、大半須視中國戰事之政治的與經濟的傾向而定、</p>
<p>路透社十九日倫敦電、據路透社消息、目下尙未有英國繼續支持中國穩定法幣基金之問題發生、惟倫敦人士之一般意見、則認爲此項支持、如有必要時、將可照辦、若干觀察家雖承認中國法幣、受入超之影響、惟以爲此外尙有一重大之影響、即日人或以大批聯準鈔票掉換中國法幣、巳獲成功是也</p>
<p>黑市外匯漸趨穩定</p>
<p>外匯平準基金管理委員會、爲防止向黑市鉅量套買外匯起見、於前晨起限制供給上海黑市後、黑市外匯突吿暴縮但英商匯豐銀行允對各業正當需要、儘量供給後、匯價始趨穩定、市塲謠言稍戢、人心漸安、昨晨匯豐銀行掛脾英匯爲五便士、美匯爲九元六八七五、並允照掛牌行市儘量供給、英美烟公司及美孚洋行等、向匯豐及花旗等銀行、購進英美外匯、</p>
<p>正當各業得請法滙</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向關係方面探悉、財政部對於必需品之進口、規定得向外匯審核委員會巾請法定外匯、奢侈品等已飭各地海關查禁、惟因上海關情形特殊、奢侈品得依舊進口、惟是項貨品、旣不得申請法定外匯、於是改向上海黑市購買、此决黑市外匯經限制後、價格暴縮、一般投機份子、及經營奢侈品進口商、確均大受打擊、惟正當商人並未受到任何影響、</p>
<p>津地鈔票儘量兌換</p>
<p>關於天津地名之鈔票、自經中國交通兩銀行、對零星少數儘量收兌後、昨日赴中交兩行請求兌換者、依然擁擠、都係一般小錢莊之學徒夥友、因是項小錢莊專收津地鈔票、每元收費五分至二角不等、收得之後、前往兌換、旨在牟利、惟中交兩行爲安定市面起見、仍予儘量收兌、至於浙江興業·中國實業·等行外埠地名之鈔票、亦得向指定之中交等行兌換、</p>
<p>其他各行十足通用</p>
<p>自中交兩行儘量收兌天津地名之鈔票後、昨日起、各行號商店等雖大都仍拒絕行使、但已有少數收受通融、至於浙興·中實·中南·農工·農商·通商·四明·以及浙江地方等行鈔票、市塲上已十足通用、與法幣同樣、並不歧視、因是項鈔票早已歸發行準備委員會接管、亦有十足之準備、與法幣完全相同、又中交兩行爲收兌津地鈔票事、曾電總行請示、尙未得復電、</p>
<p>套買外匯計劃失敗</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、自上海外匯黑市匯價暴縮、以及中交兩行酌予限制收兌鉅額津地鈔票後、使由華北運鈔來滬套買外匯計劃失敗、市塲上傳說之山津裝專輪駛滬之三四千萬津地鈔票、如果係事實、則抵滬之後、亦無法兌換上海地名法幣、及向黑市套買外滙、因如向匕海購得黑市外滙、與華北天津之行市相差甚微、事實上已雖獲得厚利、</p>
<p>黃金續漲貼水又高</p>
<p>上海黃金暗市、前日起因外滙狂縮、以致現金飛漲後、昨日繼續高漲、父創三千一百六十元之最高半、銀樓掛牌大同行爲三百二十元、新同行爲三百十八元、又滙劃票據之貼水、因係不正當之營業、與財政部金融政策不符、所以中中交三行此後决不再予維持、因此貼水率爲一般小錢莊所操縱、乘此黑市外匯暴縮之際、故意襲斷、昨日竟漲一百六十五元、即每千元貼水一百六十五元、</p>
<p>影響公債價格低落</p>
<p>證券暗市受外滙曁現金市塲巨變之影響、持券人紛紛出售公債、購買外滙黃金、於是市塲竟供過於求、統一公債各種債票一致低跌、咋日之收盤行市、統一甲種五十七元三角、跌一元一角、乙種四十七元四角、跌一元九角、丙種四十六元四角五分、跌一元三角、丁種四十五兀九角、跌一元零五分、戊種四十六元跌一元四角五分</p>
<p>銀行公會今日會議</p>
<p>上海市銀行業同業公會所屬各會員對外匯暴縮、根本上固無若何影響、然對業務方面、則不無關係、除於前日外匯縮風下、力持鎭靜外、並於即日分籌妥善應付辦法、會一度停止供給一切外匯、昨向銀行界探悉、該銀行公會定於今日下午三時、在香港路會所召開執行委員會例會、屆時對於外匯行情劇變及華北地名鈔票拒用善後辦法、均將提出討論、餘將討論會中一切例案、</p>
<h3>美艦隊新司令　赫脫夫婦抵滬　定本月廿五日交替　雅納爾於下月歸國</h3>
<p>在華北海面游弋幾近四旬之美亞洲艦隊司令雅納爾上將、業於前日午後十二時三十分、偕同夫人及總參謀康納爾乘旗艦奧古斯泰號抵滬、此爲雅司令最後一决踐滬、而雅司令此來、確爲專候新任司令赫脫少將、以便交替、至於新司令</p>
<p>赫脫少將夫婦，巳於昨日下午二時三十分乘柯立芝總統愉抵埠、本埠美海軍界均赴碼頭迎候、雅司令派遣海軍小艇前往迎接、赫少將夫婦於大雨滂沱中登岸、據美海軍常當局消息、兩新舊司令</p>
<p>交替儀式決於本月二十五日在奧古斯泰旗艦後部甲板上舉行、現該艦已泊浦江各美艦之首、、兩司令於交替後之行踪、雖尙未可確言、但深信下月第一星期內、或將暫留上海、然後</p>
<p>再赴華北一行、雅司令則在滬有五六日之躭擱、俾與友好輩話別、然後八月一日乘柯立芝總統輪携眷返美、按新司令赫少將今年六十二歲、生於一八七七年美國之歇密根州台維斯地方、卒業於美</p>
<p>海軍學院一九二九年升任海軍少將、於一九三五年任華盛頓海軍部總委員會主席、近始卸職、曾參加西班牙世界大戰兩役、殊建勛蹟、聞赫脫少將夫婦將暫住雅納爾司令所居之法和界亞爾培路十三肝大厦內、</p>
<p>大陸報云美國亞洲艦隊總司令雅納爾海軍大將、盤桓華北海面、已逾六週、昨（十八日）乘其旗艦奧古斯泰號返滬、此爲雅大將任總司令職最後一次來滬之行、其繼任者哈特大將、定今日（十九日）午乘柯立芝總統號</p>
<p>自華盛頓行抵上海、該輪抵此、赫大將立轉乘海軍汽艇一艘登海關碼頭、而赴其陸上寓所、聞赫大將於七月二十五日接代亞洲隊司令職之前、將居陸上、關於其將來計劃、昨夜未能在本埠獲得消息惟衆信渠</p>
<p>將留本市至八月第一週、始啟程赴華北、按赫少將於十五年前、會服務於亞洲艦隊、任當時駐東方海面兩潛艇之一之指揮官載、該艇會載渠遠駛至靑島、兩載前渠任海軍部總委員會主席</p>
<p>今甫卸職赫大將原籍密歇根州之台維森、一八九九年卒業於安那波列斯之海軍學院、雅大將卸任後、將在本市盤桓五六日、與友好話別、預料將於八月一日乘柯立芝總統號啟程返美</p>
<h3>飛機塲附近發現　華正規軍</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、游舉隊戰於上海四週已多月、今聞上海華人曾見虹橋飛機塲不遠處、有戎裝佩靑天白日章之正規軍、日來虹橋區日軍甚少、使人頗爲注意、僅偶見小隊日兵、徒步或乘自由車經過而巳、衆信日軍大半已退往附近「演習」、而搜索有游擊隊嫌疑之人、故該區迭聞槍聲、</p>

<h3>四種維他命</h3>
<p>— 馮宗英</p>
<p>今日世界上的科學，眞是十分的發達，最近又有維他命E的發明，據說是在麥芽及棉子裏能够取得，此種維他命E不但對於婦女界的生育有良好貢獻，且能助長發育，看到了維他命E不由得想起了早經發明的四種維他命，A．B．C．D．故今復再申述，以吿讀者諸君：</p>
<p>維他命A—凡缺少此種維他命的，能發生眼睛病，厲害些的甚至於眼瞎，且能阻碍發育，推其病理，實因缺少黃色紫的營養食物，故缺乏此種維他命A的，應多飲牛奶及牛油，食猪肉和蛋黃，更宜多食黃色素的食料，如羅卜，波菜及各種蔬菜，而猪肝則最佳。</p>
<p>維他命B—孤島人仕近來常有患脚氣病者，即脚腫浮虛，病因有三：（一）新病初愈，（二）不踏地氣，（三）缺少營養，換句話說就是缺乏維他命，B．此病不速治，若腫至胸腹，有危害生命的可能，故宜多食新鮮肉類，蔬菜和綠色植物的葉部，糠及赤豆更宜，因糠中含有維他命B的成份最多。</p>
<p>維他命C—是在新鮮的食料中含有最豐當的成份，像新鮮的蔬菜，水果，牛奶及葡萄汁，豆等，尤其是鮮橘子的汁和蕃茄的汁，都是充分的包含着維他命C．如果一旦缺少此種食料，就會有貧血症的發現，並且有生命上的危險，故患此病而致死的亦爲數不鮮，通常患者以水手最多，因爲在航行的長程時期中，得不到新鮮的食料，致面黃肌瘦萎靡不振，但是現在航行快速，船中衛生設備完全，故現在水手及旅客患此病者日鮮。</p>
<p>維他命D—往往有許多的兄童到了叫五歲甚至於七八歲的時候，還不能行走自如，此種原因便是骨頭不硬，缺乏鹼質及磷質上也就是維他命D．致發生軟骨的病態，患此病者，宜多食牛奶，魚肝油，猪肝以及蔬菜的葉部，以補充維他命D。</p>
<h3>打中覺</h3>
<p>— 陸利時</p>
<p>在夏天，我想十分之七八的人有這樣一個習慣，每到午飯盌剛放下，呵欠就頻頻來了，躺到牀上甜蜜的黃粱夢早巳尋到了。天氣愈熱，「打中覺」的人也愈多，這是什麽原因「對於我們人生的夏令衛生究竟有多少關係？我們就來談談：</p>
<p>這是一個夏天的住的問題，要是在冬天，「打中覺」的人委直少了，夏天，氣候多麼熱，晚上，都市裏的人睡得　遲，房間狹小的家庭非上十一二點鐘纔能安歇，早晨五六點鐘又須起身了，因爲睡眠時間的不足，「打中覺」在夏大好像是一個最合衛生的辦法。</p>
<p>可是一個人剛吃飽東西，就能睡覺嗎？當然，塡飽的肚子最好能散一回步，或者靜坐一刻，一吃好飯就往牀上爬，這是要不得的習慣。有許多人飯後再也熬不住去踱方步，「打中覺」的癮已很深，這是什麽緣故？這是血液充滿胃臟集中的緣故，神經系起膠着作用，沉沉欲睡，於是他也顧不得生胃病的恐怖，要去陲了，誰都有如此的現象。</p>
<p>「打中覺」能發胖嗎？有許多人一定這樣問：這裏，我可以說並不會，我們時常可以看到一輩肥胖的人，笑咪咪而貪睡，這是他腦中代謝作用不足的原因，人愈胖而貪睡，因貪睡而更肥胖，決不是一天到晚多睡而使一個瘦子，變成胖子，並且人肥胖的原因不外乎「大食」——就是閒食頻進吃得多——和物質享受的舒適不思慮，此外人體內分泌腺的均衡關係也能使人肥胖，但有人要想靠「打中覺」而肥胖身體，這是無理由的。</p>
<p>夏天打一個「中覺」，權衡利害和事實兩方面講起來，還是利多害少，一個人的精神有限，晚上少睡，中午稍稍養息未始不是一個彌補方法，只要把「打中覺」的時間有一個規定，半小時至一小時，再也不能多了。</p>
<h3>一星期經濟單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>到了夏天，似乎應當多吃些香的東西，纔覺得合於衛生，說也奇怪，有許多人却偏喜吃臭的東西，最出鋒頭的，要算是臭豆腐乾了。每到傍晚的時光，街頭巷口，臭豆腐乾的担子，絡繹不絕，買的人也趨之若鶩，兩塊油氽的臭豆腐乾，蘸些辣油辣醬，吃兩碗茶淘飯下去，其味無窮。這臭豆腐乾，不但小戶人家愛吃，連洋房裹老爺太太少爺奶奶以及摩登小姐之流，也大半愛吃。據說吾國駐法大使顧維鈞氏也愛吃臭豆腐乾，就足見它倒也是食譜中的俊物了。筆者一家老小也都愛吃此物，最初大孩子絕對不吃，說是有害衛生，不料近來也和姊妹同化，見了臭豆腐乾，也要嘗嘗了。我們並不常吃担子上的油氽臭豆腐乾，而買了生的來，自己氽來吃，除了生油，醬油麻油毛豆，笋末之外，再多加些搪，吃時的確可口。此外更在油氽之後，和着香菌木耳毛豆邊尖等一同紅燒，那就更覺入味了。</p>

<h3>人力車</h3>
<p>— 潑林山司</p>
<p>「有二輪，「一車柄一車箱以人挽之而行」，這就是我國都市上一種極普遍的交通工具——人力車，簡單而準確的描寫。在上海我們大都把它呌作黃包車，至於北平的洋車，廣州的車仔，天津的膠皮車，內地的東洋車，都是指人力車而言。</p>
<p>僑日法商曼拿Menard在一八七四年，從日本給我們帶來了第一部人力車，我們實在應該予以無限的感激。因爲第一輛人力車是從日本運過來的，同時因爲它的原字Jinriksha也完全是日語的發音，所以人力車一向就被人認爲是日人所發明的，其實這是一個在日本小住的美國海員，爲着他的妻子生病，需要呼吸新鮮空氣，因此利用他的腦力發明了一輛類似人力車的車子載了他的妻子在花園中散步，後來給日人發現了，幾經修改，方始成爲今日的人力車。</p>
<p>「文不能擺測字攤，武不能抗黃包車」，這兩句話本來是識笑一般低能兒的；不過黃包車夫的被人輕視由此亦可想見。拉黃包車再苦也沒有了，在表面上看來，似乎每一個黃包車夫，都有一付鋼鐵一般的身體，其實不過是外强中乾」，憑良心講，兩碗薄粥還不够他們出一身臭汗。此外他們時常要給巡捕撬去照會，正如頑皮的學生時常要給嚴格的師長責罰一樣。而且還有甚麼男女不得同坐，不準拉病人，不許載笨重貨物……於是乎他們的生路越見减少；我以爲假使人力車夫的待遇不儘量提高的話，終有一天人力車會被海汰的。</p>
<h3>墨晶眼鏡的話</h3>
<p>— （徐露）</p>
<p>夏已奏起了她的序曲，走在路上，坐在車中，眼前的一片，只是耀炫人目的光亮而巳！</p>
<p>在這熱浪襲人的時節，人們的眼睛上面，便大都多王了一副太陽眼鏡，配上了很深顏色的鏡片，飾上了動人可愛的彩色的框邊</p>
<p>的確；太陽眼鏡自有其存在的價値，夏天的炎熱，本來是够使人煩躁的了，在太陽下奔波的當兒，還要加上這眼前一片炫目的白熱的陽光，人便益發的疲倦了！但是，假使戴上了太陽眼鏡的話，那是的確的，眼前便像整個的調換了一個世界，醒目的淸凉，幽靜的淸凉，雖然熱浪無情地四面侵襲，這是肉體的忍受，然而心窩中却是相當的爽快的，同時，忍受的程度，便也好像减低了許多，這是有經騐的人，不難體騐出來的！</p>
<p>最後，我却要忠吿讀者一句話，就是不戴則已，要戴的話，眼鏡木身的片子，我們應該注意一下，切不要貪便宜貨而無形中害了自已的眼睛，以致吃上無窮的虧，不是說要怎樣好，總要以不傷目力爲是，吾則；爲了一方面，而害了他方面，這究竟不値得的啊！</p>

<h3>粤女赴美被押</h3>
<p>香港有一輪船，名東洋者，開往舊金山埠，船中載有廣東美女二十人。到埠之日，各皆粉白黛綠，翠袖紅衫，嬝娘亭亭，相携上岸。乃土人見之，大爲驚異，以爲此種妖姬來埠何幹，殆將爲倚門賣笑之舉者耶。遂即報吿地方官憲，官憲聞報，登時簽差拘拿，押入捕房，以待審訊。及臨審之時，有人謂之曰：「木埠現禁華娼，凡來此者均宜按律綁赴市曹槍決，行見花容玉貌，轉瞬爲紅粉骷髏矣。」諸女郞大爲慘懼，號哭失聲。官憲乃諭之曰：「並無此說，不過欲常堂一訊質耳。若果係來埠爲娼，即當發交原船戰還故鄕也。」諸女郞始各安心，惟均不願回家，並延狀師爲之伸訴，方得釋放云。</p>
<h3>格致書院</h3>
<p>上海格致書院諸董事，於咋日在英國領事署內聚會，在會者傳蘭雅君、你烈君、雪村徐君、錦堂王君及麥領事也。麥領事宜於衆曰。。「前蒙會審衙門以罰款一百兩撥歸於書院，又兩江總督饋銀一千兩。故捐銀一事大足以慶幸！」繼由傳蘭雜聲明，渠曾允許致書英國，請各製作行捐格致器具，今已得一大行回書，呈上衆覽。其送來之器具及模樣，不日即可到中國矣。衆董事皆仲謝意，並請傳君代達。傳蘭雅於是再宣於衆日：「初謀此舉時，未敢大有所望也。乃以今勢計之，則此舉之後望頗大。故吾儕宜擴大其規，庶幾可爲振興格致各學，以禆益中國也。」此會的三小時始散。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>略談少名士</h3>
<p>— 尙卿</p>
<p>所謂少名士，當然是指年紀尙輕，不到四十歲的人說的。可是爲了他們年紀輕，雖然也一例可以稱之爲名士，派頭却和老的，舊的，有些不同，至少，他們是寫白話文的，所以少名士，也就可稱之爲新名士。</p>
<p>我對於少名士的身份，價値等項，也和我對於老名士一樣，不要有所論到。人人旣以他們爲名士，他們自已也以爲是名士，我就以名士稱他們，而說我耍說的話。</p>
<p>他們多少總有幾分老名士的習氣，爲人所不滿。然而他們不迷信，沒有復古思想，他們的前途，遠在老名士之上，他們是有希望的。可是他們也有他們的致命傷，足以腐蝕他們自己而於國家社會無所貢獻。</p>
<p>他們，自以爲是藝術家，藝術家應有藝術家的風度的，於是他們便處處顯出浪漫的（羅曼的克）氣息來。他們儘管在言論上反對老名士的使酒，吸雅片，討小老婆，而他們在行動上却也不免流連於茶室，跳舞塲，而追求「自由戀愛」。老實說，他們在有些地方，還不如老名士，例如他們大都不講信義，說了話不算數，不負責任，給他們做什麼事，只一味敷衍或竟撒爛汚。在他們說來，他們是有浪漫性的藝術家，不屑拘拘於此。他們是唯情主義者，不願意委屈自已的感情來做在理智上應做的事情。他們天天過着渾淘淘的日子，自己也莫名其所以然，更不知將來要伊於胡底。……</p>
<p>我這樣說他們，一毫沒有看輕他們的意思，假使他們對於人生確有如此不可的信念，我也不來非議他們，因爲人都有選擇自己生活方式的自由的。然而我奇怪，不知他們可曾想想：他們的一生，他們的出生此世，是吾呌他們來這樣消耗他們自己的？可會想想：大範圍說來，他們是全人羣之一，小範圍說來，他們是他們四週接觸的人羣（例如親友）之一，而他們和一切人羣有絕對不可分開的關係，他們的慢性自殺，更將影響到一切人羣前途的不利？他們果然心安麽？耍這樣沉迷不返麼？</p>
<p>我這樣說，更一毫沒有看不起藝術家，或任何唯情生義者的意思。反之，我是極端尊重這樣的人的。然而我以爲眞正的藝術家或唯情主義者裏面，却有着釋迦牟尼，耶穌，諸大敎主，有着孔子，柏拉圖，諸大思想家，甚至有着亞力山大，拿破崙，諸大軍事家，決不會有着一味敷衍或竟撒爛汚的人。因爲眞正的藝術或唯情，決不是自私的，偷懶的，消極的，而是大衆的，努力的，有所成就的。就是以歌德，拜倫，甚至王爾德諸人論，他們當時的地位以及後世的聲名，也決不是藉着藝術的浪漫而是藉着浪漫的藝術而獲得的；換言之，他們在藝術上確有所得，也確要有所發表，所以出之於浪漫的一途，決不是在浪漫的途上要有所得，要發揮他們的藝術；更說得淸楚些：他們的偉大，決不是爲了他們會玩女人，會撒爛汚，而是爲了他們在藝術上的見解與成就；玩女人，撒爛汚，不過是生活上，也就是藝術上未能免去的一些點綴而巳。吾則會玩女人，撒爛汚的人很多，爲什麽不都是藝術家呢？我請他們自已問問看：他們怎樣呢？他們不是在倒因爲果麽？不是在舍本逐末麽？</p>
<p>在平時，一個藝術家就不應該專以浪漫爲事，在現在，大家戮力於抗建的現在，尢其不應該這樣。他們比了老名士，有更多的機會，難道不想就在他們的嗜好，生活和藝術上，作一些眞實不虛的表見麼？至於怎樣的表見才算眞實不虛，他們也和老名士一樣，是很知道的，也用不着我的詞費。</p>
<h3>戚繼光的橫槊稿</h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>新近買到一部戚繼光的止止堂集，其中「橫槊稿」是戚氏的詩集·題名的意思，大的是追慕橫槊賦詩的風韻吧，雖然曹操與戚繼光是絕對相反的人物。戚氏能於戎馬倥惚軍書旁午之際寫詩，眞可說是儒將風流了。方之今日，如馮玉祥的白話詩，張向華羅卓英的絕句，也是同樣的詩人將軍吧？</p>
<p>明嘉靖萬曆間的名將戚繼光生平有兩件大事，一件是嘉靖中在浙閩掃蕩敵寇，一件便是隆慶初在薊門禦邊。他在浙閩是出之以狂風掃落葉的迅疾的，所以作詩的機會較少；但在薊門則好整以暇，只是防守罷了，因此在分量上此時的詩也較多，甚至能產生千餘言的長詩「薊門述」。他的詩和他的駢散文章一樣，並不十分明朗，稍覺拗澀，但也不過於穩晦。</p>
<p>他是將他的全身心獻給他的國家的。這樣的表白，詩中屢可見到。寄書云：「寄書向知己，不解作家音。男兒鐵石志，總是報君心」。馬上作去：「一年三百六十日，多是橫戈馬上行。」望闕台云：「十載驅馳海色寒，孤臣於此望宸鑾。繁霜盡是心頭血，灑向千峯秋葉丹。」辛亥年（卽嘉靖三十年）戍邊有感云：「每經霜露候，報國眼常明。」盟忠樓云：「擊楫前賢志，裁襟國士恩。」關嶺寺有感云：「一片孤臣雨鬢斑。」普寗寺有戚云：「百戰雖能寬束帶，平生自慰有孤忠。」船廠阻雨云：「驅馳還我輩，不惜鬢毛蒼。一</p>
<p>他的傳誦至今的名篇大　要算是凱歌了：「萬人一心兮泰山可撼；惟忠與義兮氣衝斗牛。主將親我兮勝如父母；干犯軍法兮身不自由。號令明兮賞罰信，赴水火兮敢遲留？上報天子兮下救黔首，殺盡××兮覓個封侯。」此歌甚好，惟末句似有自私的成分在內，但也只是爲大衆說法，略帶點引誘而已。他自己的觀念是並非如此的。韜鈐深處所云「封侯非我意，但願海波平，」便是極好的回答；他是只知有國，不知有已的</p>
<p>「歷代名人生卒年表」上不會記有戚繼光的生卒。據丙子除夕署中有戚首句云：「五十春光隔曙暉」，丙子（萬曆四年）時爲五十歲，生年或當爲嘉靖六年（一五二七）。卒年可查明史。他是隆慶二年率兵北上的。「在鈸十六年。居正歿半歲，當國者遽改之廣東，繼光悒悒不得志，强一赴，踰年卽謝病。居三年，奪俸，繼光亦遂卒。」大的從北上到死，在鎭十六年，廣東做小官一年，家居三年，其間約二十年，那末從隆慶二年往下算二十年，他的卒年大的是萬曆七年（一五七九）左右了。丙子一詩當爲在廣東署中所作。他替國家建了許多功勞，結果只落得被劾奪俸，鬱鬱以終。但是，卽使他遭遇逆境，他的一片忠心，仍是爲國的。丙子詩中便有這樣的詩句：「共君莫話當年事，赤膽猶股白髮稀。」像這樣始終犧牲小我獻給國家，允文允武的民族英雄，是多末令人欽佩呵</p>

<h3>紅鬼子瓦西卡</h3>
<p>— 高爾基著　狄周譯</p>
<p>「那末，……離開這裏，去開始新的生活好嗎？」</p>
<p>「到什麼地方去呢？」阿玖斯尼亞問。</p>
<p>「隨便到什麽地方都好，……我這决可以向木馬塲老闆要求一筆賠償金……依照法律他是不能不給的，此外，我自己身邊也還有六百盧布。」</p>
<p>「多少？」她問。</p>
<p>「六百盧布。」</p>
<p>「啊，你有這麽多嗎！」她說着，打了個呵欠。</p>
<p>「是了，……這點錢可以用一部分，來開一家店……而且……如果從木馬塲老闆那里拿到了錢，……那來，到新比利斯克去吧。到沙瑪拉也好……就在那裏開一家店吧，……開一家在鎮上數一數二的堂子吧，……收容一批最漂亮的姑娘吧，……定價每張入塲劵五宣布。」</p>
<p>「你胡謅，」阿玖斯尼亞笑着。</p>
<p>「你看那邊怎樣？一定可以順利進行的呀……」</p>
<p>「怎麽樣……」</p>
<p>「照我說的辦……要是你喜歡，我們可以結婚。」</p>
<p>「你說什麼？」阿玖斯尼亞傻氣的閃着眼呌道。</p>
<p>「結婚啦！」瓦西卡有點兒不安似的重說了一遍。</p>
<p>「你和我嗎？」</p>
<p>「對啦……」</p>
<p>阿玖斯尼亞大聲笑起來。身體在椅子上搖晃着，椅子咯咯作響，她想捧腹呵呵大笑，可是却很不自然的，發出格格的笑聲來。</p>
<p>「你怎麽了？」瓦西卡問，貪心不足的神色，又在他眼中出現，但是她還在笑。</p>
<p>「有什麼好笑呢？」他問她說。</p>
<p>於是，她邊笑邊呌的說道：（十二）</p>

<h3>籬邊偶語（上）</h3>
<p>— 迂堂</p>
<p>我愛菊，可是我愛看那些僅堪點綴疎籬的婆婆野菊，而不是曾經揄揚品題的名種異葩。因爲前者得天趣，後者有匠氣。對於菊朋的戲，我愛好他的唱做富有古趣，即所謂書卷氣，而摒棄他最近那種矯揉做作的咬宇行腔。廿一年冬菊朋跟小樓遏雲來申我天天去「看」，我雖有熟識的案目，可以坐到第五六排，可是他在台上唱些什麽，我還是聽不淸楚，有時眞跟看無聲電影似的。菊朋的琴師會吿訴我說言老闆在台上唱，速他都聽不見，祇可望着他口脣開翁，身手動作，捉摸着絃。道也難怪，實在天蟾的院子太大啦。菊朋北返不久，我也到了北平，滿望在北平那種小院子聽他的戲，可是那决他沒露。後來就膺聘漢皐，在那裏躭擱了很久，在平時我天天到他寓所聽他吊嗓，他一面唱一面很嚴格的訓練他的琴師，使與他的腔，絲絲入扣，從那時起，我發現菊朋已在開始創造他的所謂「言腔」。他先把每一個字安放在一個妥當的音階上，允其對於去聲字和陽平字，處理得格外審愼，然後竭力運用他的巧思，把每一個腔，不論長的短的，一律加以强調，或不即不離的增减和竄改，他把花臉和靑衣的腔，脫胎換骨，取爲己用，有時我甚至疑心他還在採用大鼓的腔，這種苦苦推敵，刻意求工的結果，使他的唱完全走向「纖巧」的二條路上，一開口便是「纖」，一開口便是「巧」，把老生應有的各種音節的佳處，都給掩沒了。幸虧菊朋還算有很深的修養，要換了別人，經過這樣轉變，管敎「貧」得不成話說。假如說從前的菊朋像一只柴窰古瓶，那麽現在的菊朋，像一個縷刻精細的象牙球。假如書法來作醫，那麽從前菊朋的戲，如右軍蘭亭，現在他確是在拿時下流行的「美術體」炫世了。這種蛻變在菊朋許是爲了自知古調獨彈，難以討好，爲了生意眼，不得不另闢蹊徑，出於無奈，或許他對於先輩典型的信仰，發生動搖，所以自作聰明，獨創新聲，另立宗派，兩說都有相當理由。</p>
<p>闊別八戲，此决我料想他一定又携帶了滿腹的「新腔」來，爲滬人一新耳日，因爲菊朋或許比我們更知道些，在上海唱戲，沒有「噱頭」是不行的。</p>
<h3>聲勢浩大的慈善公演</h3>
<p>— 紫燕</p>
<p>七月廿四至卅日大有可觀</p>
<p>上海業餘話劇員慈善公演，經過了二個多月的籌備，最近已決定從本月二十四日起就將在黃金大戲院舉行了。參加這决演出的劇團計有「工華」，「互助」，「交誼社」，「夜鷹」，「保聯」，「精武」，「華聯」，「復旦」，「銀錢」，「益友」等十僩，另外還有「上海劇藝社」，「中國女中」，「雪社」，「樂文」，「職婦」等五個劇團贊助參加銷票及前後臺事務工作，正可以稱得起是「堂堂之陣」，這樣許多著名社會團體的劇團聯合公演，不論是戲目或塲數，在中國戲劇史上都是空前的，即是一九三七年春上海各劇團的春季聯合公演，也沒有這决浩大。何况這决公演又是爲了「慈善」，較之純粹的聯合公演，是更有其社會意義的。</p>
<p>這次公演的日期計達一星期之久（從二十四日起至三十日止），塲數一共是九塲，有一七個多慕劇，三個獨幕劇。</p>
<p>因爲是慈善公演，門票計分五元，二元，一元，五角四種，另外還有一種聯票，是每個戲都可以看得，一元的聯票只售五元，二元的只售十元。</p>
<p>演出的節目和事件，已經決定，現在探錄如下：</p>
<p>七月二十四日下午八時，夜鷹劇社演出「永久的朋友」，康民編劇，予且導演，其中還有一支歌，作曲的是陳歌章。</p>
<p>七月二十五日下午八時，華聯劇團演出「醉生夢死」，是英國S毛罕姆的原著，由徐渠導演。</p>
<p>七月二十六日下午八時，銀聯劇團演出「緩期還債」，是英國戴耳原著，陳棉改編，夏霞導演的。</p>
<p>七月二十七日下午五時一刻，互助劇團演出「花濺淚」，這個戲講的是舞女生活，這决女演員也都是各舞廳的紅舞女，可謂是現身說法，劇本是于伶寫的，由曾演過這個戲的「米米」的藍蘭導演。</p>
<p>七月二十八日下午八時，保聯劇團演出「日出之前」，是由「羣鶯亂飛」改的，編劇者即是替本報春秋寫「女彈詞」的沈宥，導演者是魯思。</p>
<p>七月二十九日下午二時，復旦劇社演出「生死戀」，也是英國毛罕姆的原著，翻譯者是方于，導演吳仞之，「人之初」的導演者就是他。</p>
<p>七月二十九日下午八時，上海業餘戲劇交誼社演出三個獨幕劇，計爲吳天的創作「走」，丫，雅魯納爾的「破舊的別墅」，和柴霍夫（今年是他的逝世三十五年紀念）的「成全好事」，這三個戲在上海都未演過，在中國其他別的地方怕也都沒有演過。</p>
<p>七月三十日下午二時和八時二塲，都由「工華」，「益友」，「精武」三個劇團聯合演出「阿Q正傳」，這個「阿Q正傳」的劇本是田漢導的，和現在中法劇社在演的許幸之的本子不同，田漢的這個戲，據內行批評，是他所有副本中寫作技巧中最好的一個，在內地已演過好多决了，但在上海這還是第一次，導演者是章杰。</p>
<p>這决慈善公演，上海劇藝社本來是也打算參與其盛的，但因爲忙於作接連四個月的長期公演準佛，所以事實上無法參加，不過將來長期公演時，據說是將專演一塲，把收入劃過來作爲參加演出的。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>因言菊朋的紅想起貫大元的潦倒</p>
<p>此决菊朋應聘黃金，居然天天滿堂，雖値疾風暴雨之夕，上座亦不稍衰，豈但打破紀錄，抑且出乎任何意料之外。其實平心而論，不但怪腔並未取銷，恐怕還要較前加甚，余因誤聽友人之言，說他嗓音業已復元，遂於言，侯，馬，合演「進宮」之夕，冒暑往觀，結果很覺失望。是日余座稍遠，然無論如何，決不應一字聽不眞切，只聞每段末尾來一怪腔也。彼自與彥衡分裂後，即獨出心裁，極力以汪笑儂，程硯秋，二人爲法，凡他一收一放，忽寬，忽細，以及尺寸特別拖慢的地方，胥爲任何譚派鬚生所無。歸結一句話，即是纖巧和撤慢的地方是摹倣的旦腔，忽收忽放的尾聲是取法的在調，滿好的譚派老生底子，一變而成爲今日之言派怪調，是無怪北平人軍呼彼曰「法國老生」也。此番南下出演法租界黃金戲院，營業鼎盛，我故以滑稽口吻對之曰「黃金在法租界無怪法國老生大紅也。」</p>
<p>證以月前誤傳叔岩南來之消息會轟動全滬，和此番黃金收穫之異常豐富，可知海上顧曲界渴望聽好戲之心理，着實太普遍而需要亦太積極了。本來，「物極必反」，近十數年來且角太昌盛，鬚生太衰落了。高慶奎雖說太雜，但究竟還有條好嗓子，能給臺下痛之快之的聽兩句，可惜近來又塌中啦。王又宸固然不擅靠把，但他嗓音甜潤，眞有幾句譚味，而他也於久不蒞滬之時，一命歸陰。（六三）</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles Erupt in Changzhi and Jincheng Areas; Japanese Invaders Blocked in Shanxi; Japanese Divide Forces to Eye the Suiyuan Baotou Area with Intense Fighting; Xia Wei and Cai Tingkai Inspect Western Guangdong and Re-deploy Defenses</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The fierce battle in Southern Shanxi continues to unfold intensely. The military focus has now shifted to the Changzhi and Jincheng areas. Since the beginning of the month, the Japanese army has mobilized five divisions and one brigade, totaling over 120,000 troops, and launched a massive encirclement of the Taihang Mountains in five routes. The Chinese army has also risen up to meet the enemy in separate engagements. The recent situation on each front is as follows: The main force of over 20,000 Japanese troops advancing south along the Baijin Highway, after successively capturing Huaqin County, Wuxiang, Yushe, and Liaoxian, was attacked by the Chinese army on both sides of the Baijin Highway. Furthermore, a certain Chinese army unit maneuvered behind the Japanese forces and launched a surprise attack, causing the Japanese to collapse and flee south. In addition to recapturing Liaoxian first on the 7th, the Chinese army successively captured Yushe and Wuxiang on the 10th and 11th. The fleeing Japanese troops then entrenched themselves in Xiangyuan. The Chinese army continued to pursue and bombard them. On the 12th, the Japanese troops fled southwest to Xiadian. The Chinese army then captured Xiangyuan. The 2,000 Japanese troops advancing south from Qin County attempted to move directly towards Xiadian, eventually joining forces with the Japanese troops fleeing south from Wuxiang to launch a southward attack. On the 13th, they captured Changzhi. Japanese traces have also been discovered near Yincheng Town south of Changzhi. As for the Japanese troops advancing east along the Hongtun Avenue, they reached Tunliu on the 11th and moved east towards Changzhi. The Chinese army pursued them along the Baijin Highway, causing the Japanese to flee south desperately. At the same time, another Chinese army unit intercepted the rear of the Japanese troops on the Hongtun Highway, posing a significant threat to the Japanese. Furthermore, the main force of over 10,000 Japanese troops advancing east from Yicheng along the Yiqin Highway had their vanguard reach Qinshui by the 13th. Another force, advancing from Zhongcun, Dongfeng, and Yangcheng, engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army on the Yiqin Highway. Currently, the areas of Qinshui, Dongfeng, and Yangcheng are under daily threat of a combined Japanese attack on Jincheng. As for the Japanese troops advancing west along the Bojin Highway in northern Henan, their momentum has been blunted by Chinese army flanking attacks and they have now become quiet. Moreover, the Japanese troops advancing west from Handan, southern Hebei, to Shexian suffered heavy casualties after fighting the Chinese army at Dongyangguan and are now in a standoff. In summary, the Japanese army is still attempting to advance on the Taihang Mountains with multiple forces converging, with their main force advancing east from the Baijin Highway and Yicheng, planning to attack Jincheng. However, the main Chinese forces are meeting the enemy in separate engagements, repeatedly inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese. Currently, the Japanese army has been cut into multiple segments by the Chinese army, and their offensive has reached the end of its strength. Relying on favorable terrain and employing mobile strike tactics, it will not be difficult for the Chinese to shatter their dream of invading the Taihang Mountains, just as they shattered their invasion of the Zhongtiao Mountains.

<p>(Chongqing) According to news from Chinese sources today, although the great battle in southeastern Shanxi Province has been going on for a week, the intensity has not diminished. After the Chinese army recaptured Wuxiang, they advanced victoriously to the south, and on July 12, they recaptured Qin County. It is reported that the Japanese army occupied Changzhi on July 13 and is now eyeing Yuncheng further south. Fighting is currently underway in that area. The Japanese are clearly attempting to strike at Yincheng and Jincheng near the Shanxi-Henan border. One Japanese column advanced east from Yicheng and reportedly reached Dongfeng Bo, west of Yangcheng, on July 14. Another column advanced south from Qinshui, hoping to join forces with the column west of Yangcheng to attack Yangcheng. (19th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a spokesman for the Chinese High Command at an intelligence conference yesterday, the Japanese troops attacking Shanxi are now completely stalled. In order to halt the Japanese advance, the Chinese army has employed several methods, first driving the Japanese out of the Zhongtiao Mountain area. The Japanese force of 120,000 troops, divided into five routes, concentrated in central Shanxi, but were blocked by the Chinese army on each front. The new strategy currently adopted by the Chinese army is to immediately encircle a city after it falls. This strategy has been remarkably successful in Tengqing (phonetic), east of Fanshi, and Liaoxian and Yushe, east of Dagu. Before the Japanese army arrives, the Chinese army withdraws from the city according to a predetermined plan, and then immediately besieges the city after the Japanese occupy it. (19th Huitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) The Japanese troops entrenched in Xinyang, in addition to actively building roads and strengthening fortifications at various strongholds, have been relatively inactive. On the 14th, a number of Japanese infantry suddenly increased at Changtaiguan. On the 15th, the Chinese army launched a lightning strike on Changtaiguan, successively occupying Liujiazhuang and Zhangjiazhuang (both northwest of Changtaiguan). The Japanese army relied on fortifications to hold firm, and fierce fighting lasted all day. Unable to withstand the assault, the Japanese changed tactics, dividing into two routes to harass the Chinese, one from Hedong Zhangcun (south of Changtaiguan) and one from Shiying (southwest of Changtaiguan) and Da Xiaowangzhuang (northeast of Changtaiguan). Currently, the Chinese and Japanese forces are in a standoff in Yangcun. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a spokesman for the Chinese army, 700 Japanese infantrymen, 400 cavalrymen, and 58 tanks attacked Shatingjiafang (phonetic) near Baotou, western Suiyuan, yesterday. The Chinese army put up the strongest resistance, and the fierce fighting was exceptionally intense. (19th Huitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) After many days of quiet on the upper and lower reaches of the West River, Xia Wei and Cai Tingkai recently inspected the West River and have redeployed defenses. Deng Longguang remains on the front line, in command of military affairs. Fierce fighting continues near Jiangmen and Xinhui. In eastern Guangdong, the Chinese side has dispatched new mechanized troops to reinforce defenses. (19th special dispatch)</p>

<p>Liuhuang After the Chinese army recaptured Chaoan on the evening of the 16th, the Japanese troops in Fengxi, Fuyang, Yinhu, Hecao, and other places also retreated upon hearing the news. On the morning of the 17th, the Japanese dispatched over 200 infantry, artillery, and mules and horses from Shantou to reinforce, but were intercepted by the Chinese army, suffering hundreds of casualties. The Chinese army then decided that it had already achieved a significant victory at this point and had destroyed all the Japanese fortifications. Therefore, on the evening of the 17th, they voluntarily abandoned Chao City. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to military news received here today, a small number of Japanese remnants, including several high-ranking officers, are now holed up in the Yingzhou Hotel in Chaozhou City, stubbornly defending their position. At the same time, the Japanese troops who have been expelled from Chaozhou are now based at Jinshan and Lushan (both phonetic) south of the city. The Japanese have dispatched planes from Shantou to reinforce the besieged Japanese troops in the Chaozhou urban area. Six Japanese warships appeared off Shanwei yesterday morning, and eight Japanese planes were scouting the sky, likely intending to land troops. (19th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Lianghe On the morning of the 15th, the Chinese army launched an attack on the Japanese troops at Changtaiguan with irresistible force. At 7:00 AM, they occupied Fenhui and Yuzhuang, and at 8:00 AM, they recaptured Baozhuang and Weijiazhuang. The Japanese troops relied on the fortifications of Changtaiguan to stubbornly resist. The Chinese army charged and killed many times, killing countless Japanese troops. Around 2:00 PM, the Japanese divided their forces into two units, attempting to attack the flanks of the Chinese army, but were severely beaten and fled back. Currently, they are still in a standoff.

The Japanese troops followed, and when the Japanese troops were far from the city, the main force of the Chinese army stormed into the city, while another portion fiercely attacked the rear of the Japanese army. The Japanese troops were frightened and fled north in disarray, and Qingfeng City was recaptured. (19th dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>International Phenomena and Great Britain</h3>
<p>The struggle between the two major international blocs is evolving with time. Due to the delay in establishing an anti-aggression front, the aggression group is particularly arrogant. In the Far East, negotiations in Tokyo are taking place amidst a heated anti-British movement, demanding that Britain yield without a fight. In Central and Eastern Europe, Hitler is deliberately seizing Danzig and threatening the small countries of the Baltic Sea while simultaneously launching domestic newspapers and magazines to fiercely attack Britain. In the Mediterranean, Spain has won its internal strife with foreign aid and is already heavily constrained. Recently, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Franco is clearly aimed at intensifying control over Spain and further threatening Britain in terms of military strategy. At the same time, Gaeda, the spokesman for the Black Shirt Prime Minister, has also threatened to abolish the Anglo-Italian Agreement, which exists in name only. All of this, simultaneously evolving into three different types of offensives, is by no means accidental or localized, but an organic and coordinated strategy. The exorbitant demands in the Tokyo negotiations hope to pressure Britain to make concessions to Germany and Italy on the Polish or Mediterranean issues. The crisis in Central and Eastern Europe or the waves in the Mediterranean will undoubtedly raise Japan's bargaining power. What is most noteworthy here is that the three offensives all target Britain as a common and direct object. This is very clear, not because Britain is the weakest, but because Britain is the most prone to compromise and the easiest to subdue.</p>
<p>The current sharpening of the international crisis is certainly not a sudden occurrence, but a consequence of the superficial ease and comfort and avoidance of difficulty and seeking only peace of Great Britain and other democracies after the Great War. At the time of the "September 18th Incident," Britain actually rejected the proposal of the United States. In 1937, Britain signed the Munich Agreement, and as a result, the arrogance of aggression surged, and the international crisis was prolonged and expanded. In the Far East, the aggressors, without any scruples, advanced north and south, occupying Hainan Island and the Xinnan Islands, completing the initial layout in the Pacific Ocean, and further threatening the interests of Britain, France, and the United States. In Europe, the Czech Republic disappeared from the map, Memel was annexed, the Spanish Republic was painted with the color of fascism, Albania was destroyed, and Hitler, following in the footsteps of Wilhelm II, mounted the wild horse of eastward expansion (towards the Near East). The Mediterranean will become the "inner lake" of the Black Shirt Prime Minister because General Franco guards the gate. The lessons of these facts have made Chamberlain aware of the need to change course and begin to build an anti-aggression front, uniting with France, and successively wooing Poland, Romania, and Turkey, and negotiating mutual assistance with the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, because Britain's sincerity in abandoning its policy of appeasement has not been established, the horror of the Soviet Union's past international policies vaguely permeates the Baltic coast and other small countries in Europe. Moreover, the Soviet Union is gradually deepening its use of stubborn and cold tactics towards Britain to probe the maximum extent of Britain's concessions to the Soviet Union. Because of all these reasons, the Anglo-Soviet negotiations have reached a stalemate to this day. The most important link in the international anti-aggression front has not been established to this day, and the aggression group is even more rampant.</p>
<p>Under the fierce attack of the eastern and western aggression waves, how will Mr. Chamberlain, the helmsman, deal with it? According to Reuters, Mr. Chamberlain said in the House of Commons the day before yesterday that he had clearly rejected Japan's attempt to "pressure Britain to change its Far Eastern policy." Secondly, Mr. Ironside, an important British military leader, has arrived in Warsaw to conduct military talks with countries on the anti-aggression front. Thirdly, London authorities are conducting diplomatic talks with representatives of South Bulgaria, and it is rumored that they at least hope that South Bulgaria will not be used by the aggression group. At the same time, London has issued new instructions for the British ambassador to the Soviet Union to continue the nearly frozen negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Judging from the above points, it can be seen that the arrival of the new international crisis has spurred Chamberlain to move forward, which is a gratifying phenomenon. What we cannot rest assured about is that Britain has been deeply poisoned by empty and formal internationalism, and has almost lost its independent national policy and the new vigor of its nation as a result. Therefore, after being stimulated, its forward-looking posture may still hesitate to wait for so-called common international actions and parallel actions. The coldness of the Soviet Union and the unrest in American domestic politics are particularly sufficient to discourage those who lack determination. In fact, hesitating and wavering is tantamount to rewarding evil, not only wasting previous efforts, but also causing endless troubles in the future. Courageous advancement will not only cause the demons to disappear due to Britain's strength, but also prevent the world from sitting idly by and allowing Britain to be the only one to suffer sacrifices, because of the common interests of the international community. China has been fighting alone for two years, and international sympathy and assistance are increasing day by day. If Britain can independently move forward on the anti-aggression front, then not only will France, Turkey, Poland, and the Baltic states immediately use their full strength to support it, but other countries will also sincerely assist it. Britain seems to expect something from the United States and the Soviet Union, but in our observation, only Britain's active advancement is the most effective way to motivate the United States and the Soviet Union!</p>
<h3>Government Maintains Legal Tender; Policy Remains Unchanged; Statement from Finance Ministry Spokesperson</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Regarding the recent foreign exchange turmoil in Shanghai, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance issued the following statement today:</p>
<p>The Chinese government's policy for the legal tender remains its original maintenance, in order to be consistent with the national economy and to have a monetary system that can freely supply legitimate trade. The Ministry of Finance has repeatedly made statements and announcements on this point, and there have been no changes to date. Since the outbreak of the war, the government has striven to provide legal trade with foreign exchange convenience. Before March 1938, foreign exchange could be freely bought and sold according to the exchange rate set by the government. However, since the establishment of the puppet North China Preparation Bank under Japanese control in March, the government had to restrict the management of foreign exchange. However, it still tried to allocate necessary foreign exchange. Later, the Japanese attempts to destroy the legal tender became even more numerous. In addition to issuing a large number of Japanese military yen and puppet North China United Preparation Bank banknotes, it also issued the so-called puppet Huaxing Bank banknotes. As a result, the amount of banknotes in circulation suddenly increased, and the issue of China's currency value also became more complicated. In addition, the Japanese side extracted legal tender in the Japanese-occupied areas by collecting legal tender from the people, using customs revenue, and other methods, and exchanged it for foreign exchange. At the same time, it also absorbed a large number of China's export goods by means of purchase or purchase with counterfeit money, and converted them into foreign exchange. Therefore, the amount of foreign exchange that was sufficient for all needs in peacetime has decreased as a result. At the same time, a large number of non-essential goods are imported into the country, most of which are transported to the occupied areas. Although the government has recently issued an order prohibiting the import of such goods, importers are still pouring in, and some of them are even supplied to the Japanese military. China's main trade was originally domestic commerce, the amount of which far exceeds foreign trade. The decline in the exchange rate caused by enemy aggression and speculator manipulation is regrettable. However, the difficulty we have in purchasing foreign goods, as well as the temporary decline in foreign exchange prices, does not have a serious impact on China's overall economic situation. I still remember that ten years ago, the value of the US dollar was once lower than the Chinese silver dollar, and one pound sterling was only worth about four Chinese national currencies. However, the United Kingdom and the United States did not show any signs of this at that time. In order to facilitate all parties to purchase their most needed goods from abroad, the Chinese government will continue to approve the allocation of a large amount of foreign exchange. The measures and purposes announced by the government at the beginning of this month are not only to enable the people to purchase their most needed goods and increase China's productivity to meet current needs, but also to promote the production of domestic export goods and encourage merchants to increase export trade. The various measures announced by the government have now been implemented one by one, and the result will also enhance the country's economic strength, which is why it will enhance its ability to resist Japan.

<p>(Tokyo) According to news from here this afternoon, Washio, the deputy governor of the "Huaxing Bank," is currently in Tokyo, discussing with the "China Bureau" of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and has decided to maintain the exchange rate of the "Huaxing Bank's" banknotes at six pence per pound sterling at all costs, in order to ensure that the banknotes can circulate in the Central China area.

<h3>Unified Gold Bonds; Interest Payments Suspended</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance, it has been decided to suspend interest payments on the Unified Gold Bonds, which are due on July 31. This decision was clarified in the Ministry of Finance's declaration on January 15 of this year. The declaration stated that for all bonds whose principal and interest are guaranteed by customs duties, the principal and interest will be suspended uniformly when the customs duties are withheld by the Japanese. However, the government will not object if bondholders discount interest coupons in banks. (19th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>New China; National Power Strong</h3>

<h3>Qiao Jingzhi; Dies for His Country</h3>
<p>Xi'an Qiao Jingzhi, deputy commander of the Suiyuan People's Anti-Japanese Army, since the beginning of the war, mobilized the people of Suiyuan, organized a strong anti-Japanese force, and coordinated with various units in combat, repeatedly inflicting heavy blows on the Japanese. Many puppet troops in Suiyuan also automatically defected to join. The anti-Japanese momentum of the unit was extremely vast, and it was a powerful vanguard army on the Northwest Front. The Japanese had gathered their main force several times to besiege the unit in the D青山 Mountains, but the Japanese army was miserably defeated. On June 14, in a desperate battle with the Japanese army in Gugutuo'an Village, Qingshuihe County, the Japanese army suffered more than 500 casualties. Subsequently, Japanese reinforcements greatly increased, and tanks also assisted in the battle. Qiao still commanded his troops to charge bravely, but was captured by the Japanese army after injuring both legs. After arguing with the Japanese army for a long time, he died heroically. Qiao was 39 years old and a native of Qingshuihe County, Suiyuan. He fought against Japan many times, and his battle achievements were remarkable. His great ambitions were not fulfilled, and he died for his country. All who heard this were extremely saddened. (17th dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Side Denies Spier Has Been Tried</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The spokesman of the Japanese military here today gave a clearer indication on the current situation of the British military attaché Spier, who is still being detained in Zhangjiakou. The spokesman denied the rumors from Tokyo that Spier had been tried, and said that although the Japanese side admitted that Spier was a military attaché of the embassy and had a certain diplomatic status, the crux of the case at present was whether Spier had exceeded the scope of his diplomatic duties and rights. The spokesman implied that if it was discovered that Spier had done something unfavorable to the Japanese army, it would be difficult to recognize his diplomatic status. The spokesman also said that he did not know whether the trial would be public or secret. When asked whether the Japanese side should invite a British official to attend the trial as an observer, the spokesman replied that he hoped to do so, and said that he approved of foreigners attending Spier's court-martial. (19th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Undersecretary Butler today replied in the House of Commons to questions about the detention of British military attaché Spier by the Japanese authorities in Zhangjiakou, saying that Sir Craigie, the British ambassador to Japan, had inquired about the matter with the Japanese government and was awaiting a reply. The nature of the Japanese reply will inevitably affect any action by the British government. Conservative MP Major General Knox rose to speak, saying that it was unheard of for diplomats stationed in foreign countries to attempt to handle things in this way. Are we unable to take any truly practical economic action to make the Japanese government realize this? Butler replied that all of his previous answers showed the importance that the British government attached to this matter. Knox could conclude that the British government would give serious consideration to the Japanese response. Sinclair, the leader of the Liberal Party, continued to speak, saying that since Spier had been detained for so long, more practical action should be taken. Fletcher of the Labour Party also asked whether the British government had specifically mentioned the issue of Spier's diplomatic privileges to the Japanese government. Butler replied that the government had given full consideration to this point, and that there were various special circumstances to be considered regarding the issue of diplomatic privileges. Major General Knox asked again when the British government first protested about this matter. Butler replied that a protest would be lodged immediately. (19th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Agitation; Anti-British Movement</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) According to the Japanese military newspaper Tianjin Yongbao, the "authorities" are now urging the Chinese in Tianjin to do their best to take various anti-British actions.

Foreigners here believe that the Japanese establishment of a special court to handle Chinese-British affairs is intended to harm the British. (19th Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>13th Dalai Lama's Reincarnation Found. Born in a Tibetan Family Near塔尔寺. Has been escorted by a commissioner to depart back to Tibet</h3>
<p>Lanzhou. The thirteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet has passed away for five years, and the reincarnation and inheritance issue that attracts worldwide attention will soon be resolved. The reincarnation of the thirteenth Dalai Lama (ie, the fourteenth Dalai Lama to be enthroned) has been found in Qinghai and has departed from塔尔寺 in Qinghai on the 13th of this month, escorted by the commissioner Ma Yuanhai and Tibetan search commissioner. The central government has allocated 100,000 yuan for the escort. Beforehand, the Central News Agency reporter inquired about everything from all parties. Around noon one day, the reporter arrived at the temple. The affairs were taken care of by the Mongolian and Tibetan Committee member and the former Panchen Lama’s representative to Beijing, Zhu Haishan, and others. The Dalai Lama’s reincarnation was born in a local family in Hongtu Cliff, near塔尔寺, with the secular name Lama Danzhu, five years old, with a prominent head and calm manner. His eyes are especially piercing and bright. On that day, he wore a purple monk robe, a monk hat, and black long-barreled small leather boots. Because he was not fluent in Mandarin, he only replied to the reporter’s age. Most of the other questions were answered with a shake of his head. After the reporter’s interview, the group went to the courtyard to take a photo. As a five-year-old child, the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation was surrounded by many unfamiliar guests for more than an hour, maintaining a calm and innocent attitude without any signs of nervousness. It shows that he was born with a special gift, so he can be dignified and calm. The Tibetan commissioner happened to enter the city that day to discuss escort matters with the Qinghai Provincial Government and was unable to visit. According to the results of the reporter’s interviews with Commissioner Zhu Haishan and other related parties familiar with the situation in Tibet, the following is a summary: When the thirteenth Dalai Lama passed away, he left a will regarding the direction and characteristics of the reincarnation. His Khenpo disciples followed the will and went to the sea more than 300 miles from Lhasa to observe the characteristics. At that time, the sea showed (1) a complex ethnic group with different costumes; (2) three Tibetan characters, meaning塔尔寺. Because塔尔寺 is the most ethnically complex place in China, it has always been the focus of ethnic [missing character]. The Dalai Lama’s disciples immediately followed the will and sent a commissioner to Qinghai to search for the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation. The commissioner arrived in Gannin the year before last. The Panchen Lama happened to be stationed there and gave instructions on finding the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation. The commissioner followed the instructions and rushed to Qinghai. In a local family in Hongtu Cliff, they found the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation and immediately reported to the central government and Tibet. They invited the reincarnation to塔尔寺, where his brother was a lama and took care of his daily life. The central government ordered the Qinghai Provincial Government to jointly handle the escort back to Tibet, which is now ready. It began on the 13th. Tibetan personnel and search commissioner are very impressed that the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation was found near塔尔寺, which is in line with the Dalai Lama’s will. This return to Tibet will surely be supported by the masses as the fourteenth Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama has reincarnated for thirteen generations. The fifth Dalai Lama had the highest morality and knowledge. The thirteenth Dalai Lama had the most political and religious power. The fifth Dalai Lama was intelligent, upright, and deeply [missing character] understood cause and effect. He once made a prophecy to his disciples, saying that (if the fourteenth Dalai Lama reincarnates in Qinghai, his morality and knowledge will be even higher than the fifth Dalai Lama). Now that the fourteenth Dalai Lama has been found in Qinghai, people have high hopes for the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation, expecting him to arrive in Tibet safely, receive a good education, and have profound knowledge. They also hope that the Tibetan regent authorities and Tibetan compatriots will follow the will of the thirteenth Dalai Lama and let the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation inherit the throne and properly assist him, so that the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation can become an adult and govern, with the country and the nation as the most important. Make Tibet closely linked with the central government, forming a relationship of interdependence, in order to consolidate the border. The future of the country and the nation is deeply beneficial.

<h3>Craigie and Arita Continued Negotiations Yesterday, Each Stating Opinions on the Tianjin Case, Japanese Side Claims Situation Slightly Improved</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie and Foreign Minister Arita met twice at the Foreign Minister's official residence today to discuss the general issues forming the background of the Tianjin Incident. A final decision meeting will be held on Friday to allow both sides sufficient time to consider unresolved issues. Today's two meetings lasted a total of four and a half hours. The first meeting was in the morning. The British Ambassador, accompanied by his wife, arrived at the Foreign Minister's official residence by car at 9 a.m. and left after three and a half hours. The discussion resumed at 4:50 p.m. and ended at 6:10 p.m. According to a statement released by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Bureau at 7:10 p.m., "Foreign Minister Arita and British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie continued to discuss the general issues forming the background of the Tianjin Incident at the Foreign Minister's official residence from 4:50 p.m. The meeting adjourned at 6:10 p.m. and it was decided to meet again on Friday to allow both sides sufficient time for consideration." The British Embassy also issued a similar statement. According to Japanese sources, the atmosphere of this afternoon's meeting was not much different from that of the morning. The British Ambassador still maintained a friendly attitude, but still insisted on the British demands. Compared with the meeting this morning, there was no progress to be made. The outcome of this meeting cannot be guaranteed to be optimistic, but it cannot be said that it is without hope. When the British Ambassador and Foreign Minister Arita met for the first time last Saturday, it was agreed that due to the hot weather, they would wear casual clothes during the meeting, so today's meeting was conducted in the same way. Foreign Minister Arita wore a gray casual suit, and the British Ambassador wore white. It is heard that Arita even suggested to the British Ambassador that he could take off his coat during the discussion. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Bureau issued a communiqué this afternoon stating that the second British-Japanese negotiation was held at the Foreign Minister's official residence at 9 a.m. this morning. British Ambassador Craigie presented the British government's views on the general issues forming the background of the Tianjin Incident. At the same time, Foreign Minister Arita also explained the Japanese side's views in detail. It is reliably learned that although the British domestic opinion is adopting a tough attitude towards the British-Japanese negotiations, the British Ambassador's attitude was very mild during the talks this morning, so the future of the negotiations is not pessimistic. The meeting was adjourned at 12:15 p.m. and resumed at 4 p.m. The British Ambassador took advantage of this break to secretly discuss the progress of the negotiations with the British Consul in Tianjin. (Wire report, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 9 a.m. this morning, British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie went to Foreign Minister Arita's official residence by car to continue the talks. It is expected that the British Ambassador will frankly explain Britain's views on the general principles of the background of the Tianjin Incident held by Arita, and it is expected that the British Ambassador will solemnly declare the neutrality of the British Concession and demand the protection of British interests. (Reuters, 19th) The British government telegraphed new instructions to British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie last night. The British Ambassador plans to continue negotiations with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita on the Tianjin Incident today. The British Cabinet also plans to hold a meeting today to discuss the Tokyo negotiations and the deadlock in the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union on the conclusion of a British-French-Soviet military alliance, etc. The latest news received here indicates that when Arita and the British Ambassador to Japan had their first meeting last week, they cleverly raised the entire issue of British aid to China. The method used was to avoid mentioning various related American disputes so that Britain could not demand that the United States intervene. It is said that Arita's request was to isolate Britain without assistance. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chinese newspapers here are still paying close attention to the progress of the British-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo and pointing out the great disparity in the opinions of the British and Japanese sides. They also attach importance to the British newspapers' advocacy that the scope of the Tokyo negotiations should be limited to local issues in Tianjin. This morning, the Chongqing United Daily News editorial discussed the need to promote a collective security system in the Far East, saying that the actions of the German-Italian-Japanese axis are closely coordinated with each other. Everyone knows that developments in the Far East are shifting with the European situation, and it should also be known that the European situation is being influenced by developments in the Far East. If the Western countries do not know how to promote a collective security system in the Far East, then their future destiny will be even worse than what they are currently encountering. (Reuters, 19th) Japanese newspapers have commented on the talks between Foreign Minister Arita and Ambassador Craigie. It is said that Craigie believes that the preconditions put forward by the Japanese side are two: First, Britain must recognize that the current Sino-Japanese hostile acts are combat operations. In other words, although China and Japan have not declared war, Britain must recognize the existence of a state of war. Second, Britain must adopt strict neutrality. The British Concession must carefully prevent all anti-Japanese actions and all acts that directly or indirectly hinder Japanese military operations must be stopped. Japanese political figures believe that Ambassador Craigie has recently been instructed by Prime Minister Chamberlain to prepare to recognize the state of war. However, although Britain intends to change its anti-Japanese policy, it is unwilling to declare the abandonment of its privileges in the Far East. As for the Japanese side, its attitude towards Britain remains unchanged and it is unwilling to compromise. (Haitong Wire, 19th)</p>
<h3>French Parliamentarian Discusses Far East Situation, Advises Britain and France to Resolutely Resist Japan</h3>
<p>(Paris) French far-right parliamentarian Cléry published an article in Le Temps today entitled "The Time for Counterattack Has Arrived." The article discusses the situation in the Far East and advises Britain and France to take strong steps against Japan. Cléry believes that the British-Japanese negotiations currently being held in Tokyo may not have good results. Britain and France must confront Japan and not give in. In retaliation, Japan may seize the British and French concessions in China. However, if Britain and France do not resist Japan, they will not be able to retain the concessions in the end. To seek complete preservation is unattainable. (Haitong Wire, 19th)</p>
<h3>US Republican Leader Suggests Abolishing US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and Reopening the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to Remove Obstacles to the Pittman Bill</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, Republican leader Vandenberg introduced a resolution in the Senate requiring the government to give Japan six months' notice to abolish the Treaty of Amity and Commerce signed between the US and Japan in 1911. The purpose of this move is obviously to remove obstacles to the resolution proposed by Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Pittman's resolution proposes authorizing the President to restrict the transportation of military supplies to any country that violates the Nine-Power Treaty. Secretary of State Hull has now, at the request of the committee, considered Pittman's resolution, which clashes with several clauses of the 1911 treaty. Vandenberg's resolution further calls for reconvening the 1937 Beijing Conference to determine whether Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty respecting China's integrity. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Michigan Republican Senator Vandenberg recently submitted a bill to the Senate stating that the US-Japan trade agreement is no longer suitable for the current situation and should be declared abolished immediately so that it loses its effect after six months (according to this agreement, signed in 1911, one of the signatory countries may declare its abolition six months in advance), and a new one should be negotiated based on new foundations. In addition, the Nine-Power Treaty signatory countries' meeting held in Brussels in 1937 should be reconvened to review whether Japan has destroyed the Nine-Power Treaty in the past and whether it is continuing to destroy it now. According to Vandenberg, the above-mentioned bill has been sent to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for review. (Havas Agency, 18th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt No Longer Insisting on His Opinion on the US Neutrality Act, Result of Meeting with Senate Leaders</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to news from the United Press, President Roosevelt has now abandoned his efforts to amend the Neutrality Act in this session of Congress. The President made this decision after discussing the situation with the Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate. The President and Secretary of State Hull both stressed the current crisis in Europe and said that the Senate's failure to decide on the Neutrality Act would frustrate the United States' exercise of its potential power to guide peace. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) A Reuters Washington correspondent learned that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull both clearly explained their views on the current war crisis in Europe. This view is based on reliable reports from American diplomatic representatives stationed in Europe. Well-informed sources in Washington believe that President Roosevelt will use this situation to speak to the American people when he travels to the American West this summer. At the same time, the Republican Party seems unwilling to be drawn into a position of embracing isolation, thereby giving the Democratic Party the benefit of the 1940 election campaign, so it is expected that when the next session of Congress convenes, the neutrality issue will be resolved with a free vote unconstrained by party guidelines. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt had a three-hour conversation with the Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate. After the conversation, the Senate leaders issued two statements expressing the views of the majority of Senators, who did not want to make any decisions on neutrality policy during the current session of Congress, but would like to discuss it again during the next session of Congress (ie, next January). The White House also issued a statement afterwards, roughly saying that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull have always believed that if the US Senate does not make a decision at this time, it will weaken the United States' power to influence world peace, at least in the period between today and next January. Also, according to White House Secretary 区莱君, the statement issued by the Senate is intended to ask the President not to discuss the Neutrality Act during the current session of Congress, but to rather sit and watch the European situation become tense. Because the President and Secretary of State both believe that if the US Neutrality Act is not amended, the European situation may become tense, but most Senators believe that it may not be tense before this winter. According to 区莱言, the US President's and Secretary of State's joint appeal on the Neutrality Act issue has received enthusiastic support from all parties, and there has also been an unfavorable reaction to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's delay. Finally, 区莱言 stated that, to my knowledge, the government's Neutrality Act has not only been supported by the entire American diplomatic apparatus, but also by the US Army and Navy. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to Michigan Republican Congressman Crawford, speaking to an Associated Press reporter last night, the Pittman bill to deal with Japan may not be passed by this session of Congress. 克氏 also submitted a bill to ban the shipment of goods to Japan. 克氏 further stated that the decision for Congress to adjourn early and Pittman's proposal must be postponed for discussion at the next session. According to 克氏, the majority of the American people support Roosevelt and Hull's recommendation to abolish the Neutrality Act's arms embargo. 克氏 also said, "In the next Congress, the Neutrality Act may be amended according to the government's urgent request. At that time, the American people will be able to express their beliefs. Currently, the American people feel the need to prohibit the transportation of military supplies to Japan. This sentiment is increasing. In the next Congress, general anti-Japanese public opinion will inevitably force Congress to adopt the Pittman bill." According to 克氏's prediction, unless Japan withdraws from China, the US will definitely take action against Japan. The American people are very dissatisfied with the anti-British movement instigated by the Japanese because they have realized that if the anti-British movement is created, the Japanese will definitely start an anti-American movement. 克氏 concluded by saying that if the Japanese further disrupt the situation in the Far East, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the American people will increase, and Pittman's and his personal anti-Japanese bills will definitely be passed as a result.

<h3>British and French Automotive Giants Initiate Fundraising to Send Personnel to China to Treat Wounded Soldiers and Civilians</h3>
<p>(London) British automotive giant Nuffield recently launched a fundraising campaign to raise funds to send a disability relief team to China to treat wounded soldiers and civilians. He said, "The British Society for the Treatment of Disability has now received a telegram from the Chinese Red Cross stating that it intends to establish a disability hospital in the rear and asking the Society to raise funds and find surgeons to work there. After these surgeons arrive in China, in addition to engaging in treatment, they will also train surgeons locally to teach them disability surgery in order to benefit wounded soldiers and civilians in China. The Society for the Treatment of Disability and other medical societies have already donated £1,200. "As an honorary member of the Society, I have always been enthusiastic about this righteous cause. I am donating £500 and hope that philanthropists from all walks of life will donate generously so that we can see its success as soon as possible." (Havas, 19th)</p>

<h3>Washington's Observations: European War Imminent, Hitler Intends to Seize Danzig, Serious Incidents Could Be Triggered at Any Time</h3>
<p>(New York) According to a report from the New York Times, President Roosevelt issued a warning about the danger of the European situation at a meeting with Republican and Democratic senators at the White House last night, saying that the European situation is more dangerous than generally speculated. Hitler could launch a wave of war on any day, any week, or any month. Congress is currently not considering the Neutrality Act. If a war breaks out in Europe, members of Congress will be recalled to Washington for a special meeting in the summer. After meeting with the President, US Ambassador to Belgium Davis told reporters that he was not optimistic about the situation. If the United States does not use all its spiritual power to support Britain and France, the future situation in Europe will be very sad. Davis issued two warnings to reporters: (1) Hitler will seize Danzig if he is not restrained by the power of the United States; (2) After Danzig is annexed, a new division of Poland will follow. Hitler will be the main figure in the partition of Poland, and Stalin may also be so. (3) If Hitler is encouraged by a victory in the Far East, he will shift his attention to Western European countries, and the bombing of Paris and London, which has long been feared, will shock the world. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Officials here received a report from Germany last night stating that Germany will have one million troops "ready to strike" by August 15th. Military movements throughout Germany are hectic. Thousands of troops are leaving barracks for designated areas. Each regimental number is concealed by various objects. According to official information, the number of armed reserve troops in Germany has reached one million by the end of this month. The German harvest has been accelerated so that farmers can engage in military service. Fortresses along the Rhine are being built urgently and can be completed within the next few days. Germany has ordered the Blackshirts and Stormtroopers to end their holidays before August 10th. Well-informed sources believe that the emergency will begin on August 15th and gradually intensify until the end of September, because Germany hopes that the annual heavy snow will arrive at that time to prevent France from attacking Germany through the Alps. Well-informed sources also believe that Germany is trying to create the impression that force will be used to resolve the European problem. In fact, Germany does not want to cause a war.

<h3>Danzig Takes Military Measures to Turn the Entire City into a Strong Fortress</h3>
<p>Warsaw. According to news received here, the authorities of the Free City of Danzig are now openly taking military measures to turn the city into a strong fortress. All schools in the city are garrisoned by German troops. Artillery exercises were held in the vicinity today. At this time, anti-aircraft guns are installed on the peaks near the city and on public buildings in the city, and heavy artillery is installed at various military points. The purpose of all these measures is nothing more than to resist attacks by Polish troops in the event of a conflict, so that German troops from East Prussia will not be intercepted by Polish troops when they enter the city. (Havas Agency, 18th)</p>
<h3>Poland Reissues Statement: No Changes Allowed to the Status Quo in Danzig</h3>
<p>Warsaw. According to an official communiqué released here today, Polish politicians will regard any attempt by Germany to annex Danzig, regardless of the form it takes, as a violation of the current political and legal status quo and will provoke a corresponding response. Poland's issuance of the above communiqué is due to suggestions from overseas to elect Hitler as chairman of the Danzig Senate. At the same time, German politicians in Berlin deny that Germany's attitude towards the Danzig affair has eased. Anti-Polish propaganda in Berlin newspapers is still extremely intense. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Danzig. Since the Polish authorities carried out various military preparations near Danzig, it has attracted attention from all parties. It is known that Polish engineers are also installing landmines on the highway between Hobe Ndorf and Eggers Gut on the border of Danzig to prevent emergencies. (Haitong Wire, 19th)</p>
<p>Warsaw. The Polish "Western Border Association" held mass rallies in various places yesterday, demanding that East Prussia (now German territory) be incorporated into Poland. Captain Szumielewski gave a speech in the town of Grudziadz, declaring that the Polish flag will soon be raised over Königsberg, the capital of East Prussia, and other towns in East Prussia. At a mass rally in Bydgoszcz, speakers stressed that Danzig must belong to Poland because Poland needs a naval base. They also advocated that all land inhabited by Poles outside the current territory of Poland should be incorporated into the Polish Republic in the future. This proposal was subsequently adopted by the conference as a resolution. (Haitong Wire, 19th)</p>
<h3>The Greater Ukrainian Nation Building Movement; German Conspiracies Emerge One After Another</h3>
<p>Prague - Foreign observers here claim that the Ukrainian issue will soon become a theme of German propaganda. The Slovak intelligence agency frequently issues information mentioning the Ukrainian issue, and newspapers in the Protectorate of Moravia-Bohemia reprint it. Former Prime Minister of Carpathian Ukraine, Voloshyn, and cabinet member Revay have established offices in the Slovak capital and have been active in Berlin, Vienna, and other places. Furthermore, a certain Slovak radio station may be allocated for use by Ukrainians for propaganda purposes. All of these points can prove that Slovakia will become the base for the establishment of the Greater Ukrainian movement, which is not necessarily impossible to predict. (Havas News Agency, 18th)</p>
<h3>The Key to European Peace and War Lies in Germany's Attitude</h3>
<p>(London) Britain is adopting a large-scale peace offensive, forcing Germany to choose between peace and war. Whether this is possible is being discussed privately by Conservative Party members, who hope that German public opinion will eventually influence the country's policies and move towards moderation. Although all sectors in Britain recognize that the war crisis has not yet been eliminated and that Britain's expansion of armaments cannot be neglected, they also advocate finding a way to alleviate this burden. Financial and industrial circles also believe that a large part of the country's resources and income are currently being used to prepare for war, and this situation should not be allowed to continue indefinitely. Therefore, Conservative Party members privately advocate that financial aid could be provided to Germany to (1) transform Germany's wartime industry into a peacetime industry, (2) restore the country's currency to a normal and free basis, and (3) supply the country with various raw materials. After the implementation of these proposals, Germany would no longer be able to portray itself as a "poor country" and should reduce armaments as an exchange condition. As for Germany's refusal to accept, it will be clear to the world that Führer Hitler is unwilling to compromise and only values force. Diplomatic circles do not attach importance to this plan, considering it too simplistic, and say that Führer Hitler is concerned with political issues, not economic issues.

<h3>One Hundred British Bombers Practice Second Flight to France; Fly Over Paris at High Speed; British-Polish Military Talks Began Yesterday</h3>
<p>(London) A number of Wellington bombers and other aircraft, a total of one hundred, flew to France today for a second flight practice. Aviation Undersecretary Balfour was also one of the bomber crew members. Several aircraft flew around French territory and returned to their base in Britain three hours after departure. The rest are expected to return this afternoon. Several aircraft flew over Paris at great speed and altitude. Two teams will fly to Avallon, which is still one hundred and twenty miles from Paris, encountering bad weather along the way. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) News here today is that the French Air Force authorities have drafted a plan to dispatch one hundred bombers to Britain at any time or tonight. This flight is the initial work of an "invasion" training exercise and will be used to test the soundness of the new British air defense organization. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Aircraft belonging to the British Air Force will fly to France again in the next two or three days for non-stop practice flights. The light bombers will turn back after reaching central France, while the heavy bombers will fly to the port of Marseille before flying back. The Air Ministry keeps the flight routes of the aircraft secret and will only disclose them at the last minute before the departure of the aircraft to simulate wartime conditions. The public is very interested in this and is eagerly awaiting the arrival of French aircraft in Britain. In addition, the Air Ministry is also carefully studying the dispatch of aircraft to fly over Polish airspace, as the aircraft must avoid flying over Germany, Switzerland, or Denmark due to diplomatic relations. According to well-informed sources, the Air Ministry may send aircraft to Egypt first, and then detour to Turkey, Romania, and Poland, and land once in each of these countries so that British pilots can make contact with the air force pilots of those countries. This matter requires more complicated preparations, but it can establish contact between British and Allied military personnel, which is crucial for military cooperation.

<p>Warsaw - General Ironside, leader of the British military mission, held a two-hour meeting today with Polish Army Commander-in-Chief Rydz-Śmigły and Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck. Ironside then had lunch with Polish President Mościcki. The Polish Daily commented on the British military mission's decision to come to Poland, saying that Ironside had inspected British and French troops in Paris before coming to Poland. These two events, one after another, can slightly indicate the military alliance and cooperation between Britain, France, and Poland. There is no doubt that Eyre's mission will make a great contribution to the security of the three countries. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

Generally speaking, it is still possible to reach an agreement until the last moment. (Havas News Agency, 18th)</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Eager to Restore Friendship with Romania; New Ambassadorial Candidate Determined</h3>
<p>Romanian Capital - According to reliable sources, the Soviet Union will send an ambassador to Romania again, but who the new ambassador will be has not yet been announced. Since the Soviet ambassador to Romania left office in January 1938, the Soviet Union has never sent an ambassador to Romania. If this news can be confirmed, it can prove that the Soviet Union is again trying to establish friendly relations with Romania. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>

<h3>British Parliament to Adjourn at the Beginning of Next Month; Cabinet Considers Amending Constitution; Can Be Convened at Any Time in Case of Emergency</h3>
<p>(London) The Cabinet will submit the "Summer Vacation Plan" for discussion at the weekly meeting tomorrow, so that the government and Parliament can respond calmly in the event of an emergency during the summer vacation. It is reported that Parliament will adjourn on August 4 and reconvene in mid-September (after the German Nazi Party holds a conference in Nuremberg) until the beginning of October. If no war breaks out by then, a general election will be held for the House of Commons within the year. What the government authorities are concerned about now is that the international situation may experience a crisis during the summer vacation, or while the dissolution and re-election of the House of Commons is not yet completed. Regarding the former, it is only necessary to notify all cabinet members not to leave the capital and to ask the leaders of all political parties to maintain contact with the government authorities, so that Parliament can reconvene quickly even in the event of an emergency. Regarding the latter, according to constitutional provisions, the House of Commons ceases to exist after its dissolution and can only convene an extraordinary meeting in the event of a major event involving the King. For this reason, the government authorities will propose a bill so that the House of Commons can be convened at any time in the event of an emergency after its dissolution.

<h3>Six Million Soviet Youths Ready to Defend the Country at Any Time; Sports Review Parade Held in Red Square; Athletes from All Republics Participate to Show Spirit of Unity</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Today, the Soviet Union celebrated the All-Union Sports Festival with an unprecedentedly grand sports review parade held in Red Square. Participants included 40,000 male and female athletes from all eleven trade unions, collective farms, and Red Army, Navy, and Air Force branches of the country, all of whom were elites in the domestic sports world. Soviet sports have always been known to be developed, and 6 million people have passed the sports test and been awarded the "Labor Defense Pass Badge."</p>

Before the review, a conference was held. Mikhailov, secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, delivered a speech, welcoming all athletes, saying, "Soviet youth are ready to rise up to defend the country at any time, so that those who have failed to understand the lessons of the Changkufeng Incident will have another chance to try," etc. After that, the review ceremony began in front of the party and government leaders.

The neat and solemn lineup impressed the entire audience. After the parade, the athletes of each republic held sports performances separately. The Ukrainian athletes performed the historical events of 1918 when the people of the republic and the Russians jointly drove out the German occupation forces. Afterwards, the republics also performed successively, and their festivals reflected the development of the culture of each nation in the country and their unity and friendship.

<h3>Long Yun Raises 50 Million to Expand and Build the Simao-Pu'er Railway; Provincial Highway Construction Method Determined; All Roads to Be Completed and Open to Traffic by Next Year</h3>
<p>Kunming Special Airmail News: Gejiu is the world's most productive tin-producing area, with more than 100,000 miners relying on it for a living. The annual tin output is 7,000-8,000 tons. For the convenience of transportation, the Gejiu-Bisezhai Railway was built and has been operating for more than ten years. Later, the Mengzi-Jijie to Lin'an-Shiping Railway was added, which has been operating for several years and is very convenient.</p>
<p>Expanding and Building Railways: However, due to the rugged mountain roads, narrow tracks, and many caves, the central section from Huogudu to Zhadian is extremely dangerous, with mountains on one side and cliffs on the other. The scale of its construction is considered the first in the provinces of Yunnan, and its transportation volume and business are also among the top in China's railways in terms of revenue. Unfortunately, too many people are employed and management is poor, and old debts have not yet been paid off. Now, Chairman Long deeply believes that Gejiu is a tin-producing area and Simao-Pu'er is an international route, and that there is a need to build roads in both areas. At the provincial affairs meeting yesterday, he proposed establishing an enterprise company to raise 50 million in capital to build the Pu'er-Simao Railway, planning to connect from Shiping on the Gejiu-Bisezhai Railway, passing through Yuanjiang to Pu'er and Simao. The speed will be three stations from Shiping to Yuanjiang, three stations from Yuanjiang to Mojiang, five stations from Mojiang to Pu'er, and two stations from Pu'er to Simao. In the future, if Simao is connected to Myanmar or Vietnam, it will become an international railway. Currently, Finance Director Lu Zian has personally gone to Gejiu to discuss this matter, and it is expected that there will be progress in the next few days.</p>

<h3>Japanese Blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin Only Provokes Resentment from Various Countries</h3>
<p>It is generally believed that the Japanese army has made another big mistake. Britain is preparing to strengthen its defenses in the area.</p>
<p>The "China Press" London correspondence on June 18th stated that a prominent British resident of Tianjin, who returned to his home country on leave several months ago, told reporters that the time when Britain will have to greatly strengthen its Tianjin defenses is approaching. This is because the Japanese army, beginning to realize the hopelessness of its adventurist actions in China, will engage in extremely aberrant behavior in the area. It is superfluous to revisit the Tianjin incident three weeks after it occurred. However, a few points are worth noting. The Japanese government's response to the protest from the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Clive, stating that the Tianjin dispute is a local incident that must be resolved locally, is of great significance. The Japanese government clearly admits that it has very little control over the Japanese army in China, especially the Kwantung Army, which is most evident. The reporter heard today from two well-informed correspondents of the latest news from North and Central China, that the Japanese soldiers in China are penniless, and their officers are almost the same. The reporter also noted for the first time today that the telegram hinted at the Japanese demand to store 50 million yuan worth of silver belonging to the Chinese government in the British Concession of Tianjin. The uncontrollable nature of the Japanese "young officers" class, and the fact that if Japan is drawn into another war, the "young officers" will disregard the reality of Japan's situation, and their tendency to run rampant are factors that cannot be ignored. Economic retaliation against Japan may be a response to Japan's overall erosion of British interests in China, rather than just to the blockade of Tianjin. Some people oppose this idea, but it is difficult to understand why. However, there is no doubt that the British government is seriously considering economic retaliation. Yesterday, the Tokyo dispatch of the Domei News Agency inadvertently revealed that the Japanese were extremely alarmed by Britain's consideration of economic retaliation. The British Department of Commerce is averse to anything outside of routine matters from 10 am to 4 pm, but now it is doing everything it can to insist on dissent. Certain merchants who are profiting greatly from the current situation in China are also doing the same. This is a disgusting fact, but it seems undeniable. Another common opinion is that the blockade of Tianjin is a confession of weakness by the Japanese army, and another big mistake. This move must have greatly surprised Japanese diplomats, because Tianjin has no trade to speak of, and the blockade has not made things worse than before, and the women and children in the concession have already left. Our (British) approach to the Tianjin case is to hold our ground and take no action, but the Japanese actions make the world's resentment towards Japan grow day by day, especially in the United States. This matter has aroused a feeling of annoyance and represents any issue related to this war. Only God can predict the outcome, but if Japan expects Britain to "act in good faith and cooperation," in other words, to help them subjugate the Chinese who cannot be conquered by illegal means, then it is making a very big mistake.</p>

<h3>The Gold Standard is Most Beloved: Everyone is Rushing to Exchange Banknotes for Gold, Closing at a High Price of $3,200. If Calculated According to the Exchange Rate, it is Still $400 Lower.</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market was fiery. Although the tight exchange situation had gradually eased, the gold market continued to soar wildly. It opened at 95 yuan above the previous price, and by the evening, it had reached an unprecedented peak of 3,200 yuan. Although there were fluctuations along the way, the overall trend was upward. This was because local merchants and outsiders had aggressively purchased gold the previous day and were holding onto it tightly. Today, they further increased their purchases, making the available gold even scarcer. As a result, the price rose sharply by another 145 yuan. However, due to the high exchange premium and the difficulty in obtaining banknotes, those who wanted to buy were finding it difficult to operate as they wished. Otherwise, the rise in price would have been even more difficult to contain. Therefore, according to the current exchange rate, the gold price should be between 3,550 and 3,600 yuan. Today's gold price is still about 400 yuan lower. Trading was brisk, with approximately 2,000 taels traded throughout the day. Jewelry gold also rose sharply by 15 yuan, reaching an unprecedented record of 325 yuan. Customs gold remained stable, while the prices of British and Chinese pure gold decreased slightly.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Becomes Scarcer and Rises Again by 115 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the price per tael (ten taels) initially rose because of news that HSBC would only maintain the listed exchange rate. This made people more cautious, and sellers were mostly hesitant. However, buyers were offering 3,100 yuan. A certain gold firm, eager to increase its purchases for speculators, raised the price by 50 yuan. Only then did silversmiths sell 50 taels at a price of 3,100 yuan, a jump of 95 yuan compared to the previous day. Soon after, 50 taels were bought from money changers at a price of 150 yuan. Later, a money changer, acting on behalf of a client, sold 50 taels for profit, lowering the price slightly by a dozen yuan. A money changer sold 50 taels to another money changer for 138 yuan, which was the low price of the day. At that time, British gold was approaching the 5 pence mark, and the exchange rate had broken through the 10 yuan barrier, causing buying to revive. A certain bank and money changers made aggressive purchases. Although silversmiths and spot gold firms were selling, the supply still could not meet the demand, causing the price to gradually rise. A certain gold firm, acting on behalf of speculators, also began buying, making the increase even more severe. Money changers bought 50 taels from silversmiths at a price as high as 175 yuan. Thereafter, buyers heard that the exchange rate had stabilized and that the exchange premium had soared to over 160 yuan, so their buying interest waned slightly. Money changers and retail investors rushed to sell, causing the price to fall by over 20 yuan. Gold firms sold 50 taels to money changers at a price of 150 yuan. At noon, the situation became tense again. Money changers bought 50 taels from gold firms at 160 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the afternoon, a certain gold firm and a certain silversmith, etc., were keen on buying, causing the market to be dominated by buying. The price rose again by 30 yuan. Silversmiths sold 50 taels to gold firms at a price of 190 yuan. Subsequently, money changers, acting on behalf of speculators, sold 150 taels to a certain gold firm, bringing the price down to 178 yuan at one point. But almost immediately, a certain silversmith's buying interest revived, and the price jumped by over 10 yuan in an instant. A certain silversmith bought 50 taels from gold firms at a price of 191 yuan. Late into the evening, a certain money changer bought 50 taels from gold firms at a price of 3,200 yuan, reaching an unprecedented new high. As a result, the price had increased by 145 yuan compared to the previous day. It has been rising for two consecutive days, for a total increase of 581 yuan. The spot gold price at spot gold firms was about 10 yuan higher than the current price, and buying required a reduction of 15 yuan. The current bid price for gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed price. According to inquiries, there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Follows the Rise by 15 Yuan: The Difference Between Buying and Selling Prices Widens</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael initially did not change. But around 10 o'clock, because the spot gold price opened higher by over 90 yuan, it also rose sharply by 10 yuan. Later, at 31 minutes past the hour, it was raised by another 5 yuan, for a total increase of 15 yuan. Da Tong Hang changed its listed price to 325 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang's price was 323 yuan, an unprecedented record since the market began. However, because the spot gold price has been fluctuating greatly recently, and because the purchase of old gold items must be melted down after seven days, silversmiths uniformly reduced the buying price by a dozen to twenty yuan from the selling price.</p>
<p>British Pound is Strong, Pure Gold Returns a Small Halfpenny per Ounce</p>
<p>London, 18th: Due to the strong British pound, the price of British pure gold fell by half a penny per ounce, reaching seven pounds, eight shillings, five and a half pence. This caused the Central Bank's purchase price for Chinese cash to also decrease to one thousand two hundred yuan and nine jiao. The listed price of Customs gold remained stable at two yuan, three jiao, nine fen, six li. The price of Shanghai standard gold also fell by four jiao, reaching one thousand two hundred and seven yuan and two jiao.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms are Still Making Deals: Exchange Rate Continues to Tighten, US Exchange Rate Enters the 10 Yuan Territory</h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange market: HSBC's listed rates were announced. The British exchange rate was stable, while the US exchange rate tightened by 0.025, reaching an unprecedented record of 9.6875. Except for the Indian and Hong Kong exchange rates, which remained unchanged, new low prices were discovered. The unofficial British and American exchange market started chaotic but ended stable, with the situation turning stable. The initial opening remained unchanged from the previous night's closing price. Because HSBC only allowed the maintenance of the listed price (British gold at 5 pence, US exchange rate at 9.75), the situation was actually a market with quotations but no transactions. Around 9:30, business began. Because oil firms such as Mobil and Asiatic Petroleum, and British American Tobacco, etc., suddenly wanted to absorb at the listed price, HSBC sold a considerable amount, and the market stabilized. Although the absorbing did not stop, a Hong Kong cable suddenly offered to sell, and other foreign firms also showed a slightly stronger intention to sell, so the situation became more stable. The noon closing remained unchanged, but the result continued to soften. The US exchange rate broke into the 10 yuan territory. As for the seven- and eight-month futures, sellers, seeing the current market situation, dared not easily sell off, so the further out the contract, the tighter it became. Therefore, the swap spread widened. The spot and August British gold differed by half a penny, and the US dollar differed by one yuan. Currently, the seven- and eight-month swap interest rate (excluding commissions) has reached a thick 8.23 percent per month. However, operators are still constrained by the lack of cash, so few transactions were heard. As for spot trading, it was very sparse because Western merchants such as Sassoon and a certain Fang were mostly watching. The bank's selling price for the Hong Kong exchange rate also tightened to 35 yuan.</p>
<p>HSBC's Listed British Exchange Rate Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London cable was stable for both near and far terms. The New York silver price remained stable. London gold fell by half a penny. The exchange rate for British to US dollars rose by 2.2 percent, while it fell sharply by 9.375 against Shanghai, and remained unchanged against France. The US dollar rose by 1.25 against the British pound, fell sharply by 2.54 yuan against Shanghai, and rose by 0.0625 against France. The Central Bank's listed rates for various exchanges remained as before. In the morning, the bank's spot selling prices were 5.25 pence for British gold and 10.025 yuan for the US dollar, with no gains or losses compared to the previous day. After the opening, because the major foreign firms had a large number of settlements, and because the British bank, HSBC, was only willing to supply at the previous day's listed price (5 pence for British gold and 9.75 yuan for the US dollar), the supply could not keep up, and the market immediately became tight. British gold immediately softened to 5.0625 pence, and the US dollar also tightened to 9.875 yuan. However, foreign firms still found it difficult to settle at the higher prices. When HSBC's listed rates were announced, the British exchange rate was unchanged, while the US dollar was tightened again by 0.0625. Except for the Indian and Hong Kong exchange rates, the other exchanges also tightened slightly. The White Silver Equalization Tax was announced and remained exempt. After that, British American Tobacco and other foreign firms successively bought HSBC and Chartered Bank spot gold at 5.0 pence. Then, Mobil also settled with HSBC for spot US dollars at 9.75 and 8.125 yuan. At this time, a Hong Kong cable suddenly offered to sell, and other firms also showed a slightly stronger intention to sell, so the situation turned stable. Hong Kong Cable and foreign firms such as Hua Bi Holland successively sold Asiatic Petroleum and other firms spot British gold at 5.0625 and 0.03125. It was noon at this time. The bank's selling price for the Hong Kong exchange rate also softened to 35 yuan, but few transactions were heard. By the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 5.03125 pence for British gold and 9.8125 yuan for the US dollar. The current month's British gold was 9.0625 pence, and the US dollar was 9.5625 yuan. August's British gold was 4.53125 pence, and the US dollar was 8.8125 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous night's closing, the spot British pound tightened by 1.11875, and the US dollar also softened by 4.375. The current month's British pound tightened by 1.2875, and the US dollar also softened by 4.375. August's British pound tightened by approximately 3.125, and the US dollar softened by approximately 6.875. Hong Kong: as sold by the bank, also tightened by 2 yuan. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. The trading record for the half-day is recorded below:</p>

<h3>Discount Rate Steps Up</h3>
<p>Once Reached 165 Yuan. Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts continued to rise. Initially, it was around 140 yuan per thousand yuan, but the supply could not keep up, and the demand for cash was urgent, soaring by more than 20 yuan, reaching 165 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, more people released at the higher price, causing it to fall back to 155 yuan, which was 17.5 yuan higher than the previous day. The Shanghai Money Dealers Association's call loan interest rate was listed as 1.6 jiao in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Major Cables Stabilize: Indian Silver Falls and Rises Again</h3>

<h3>The Sound of Gold Pounds is Clear and Pleasant; The Color of Gold Notes is Bright and Dazzling; Market Prices Soar… Supply is Too Scarce; Rare Notes Fall Alone… People's Minds Can Be Known</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold fell back by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate rose by 1.25. In the local exchange market, foreign firms were making many settlements. Mobil and British American Tobacco were both absorbing. Foreign banks' supply was sluggish. The market situation was very weak. The British exchange rate was 5.03125 pence, which was 1.2875 tighter than the previous day. The US exchange rate was 9.8125 yuan, which was 4.375 softer. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. The spot market opened, and because exchange drafts continued to be tight and because the northern merchants who had previously sold were rushing to replenish their positions, the market sentiment was firm and bullish, making 3,150 yuan. Wealthy people were buying enthusiastically, and many were taking profits. The market situation was hovering with firmness. The noon closing was 60 yuan. Demand was high again in the afternoon, and the opening was 90 yuan. In the end, because people's expectations were high, it was difficult to fall back, and the evening closing was 3,200 yuan, which was 145 yuan higher than the previous day. The supply of foreign currency British and American gold certificates was lacking, and market prices continued to soar. British and American gold notes were mostly purchased and hoarded by wealthy people, and there was no supply in the market. The market situation was firm and bullish. Hong Kong notes, French notes, etc., were all in high demand, and all tended to be firm. The demand for Japanese gold notes was not high, and the increase was very small.

<h3>Grain: Both are Wind and Rain; Flour and Wheat Also Tend to be Active</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's spot flour market continued to be firm. After the exchange rate shrank sharply, winds and rain intensified, and everyone was . Retail sales by local merchants and customers in the street gradually became active. However, wholesale purchases were affected by the exchange rate and the discount rate for banknotes, so they were not easy to develop for a while. Yesterday, factory prices insisted on 4.65 yuan, and local merchants all required cash. The market situation changed from weak to firm. At the same time, the goods held by firms and customers in the hands of those who bought earlier also gradually tightened, with prices 5 to 6 fen higher than before, generally requiring a selling price of over 5 yuan (exchange rate). Foreign flour had a combined high production price, with a price of 5.1 yuan (exchange rate), but the buying power of buyers was still weak, which could be called a market with quotations but no transactions. Today, 2,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Tianjin, and another 2,000 bags are being shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market trend also turned upward. Due to hurricane and rain, not many goods arrived. The sellers insisted on higher prices due to the sharp changes in the exchange rate and the increase in prices, and the selling intentions were uniformly firm. However, Japanese factories did not have any plans, only waiting for the favor of local merchants and hoarders. Approximately 1,300 bags of wheat were opened, including Suzhou, Kunshan, Danyang, and Daqiao wheat, with the highest prices being 6.73 yuan and 6.8 fen, and 5.8 fen, which was about 1 jiao higher than before.</p>
<h3>Sales are Active: Rice Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Since the turning point in financial and other issues the other day, the rice market continued to rise yesterday. Sales in the local street were active, and if hoarders were to transfer goods to each other, the trading would be unusually lively. At the same time, customer traders, wholesalers, and special goods did not show samples, and the goods in the central market took the opportunity to launch, and the asking price gradually increased. Common Jing rice in Changzhou and Wuxi was opened at a limit of 20 yuan, and high-quality tip rice was also opened at 16 yuan according to the limit. Changbang old Jing rice was also opened at 19.56 yuan, and high-quality thin rice was opened at 20 yuan. Early and late rice in Hexia was opened at 19.12 yuan, which was more than half a yuan higher than the previous market. Although there were not many tip rice goods from Duyang and Bujian markets, the limited asking price also increased by three to four jiao.</p>
<p>Customer Xian Rice: In addition to inquiries from local merchants yesterday, shops and hoarders in this street competed to argue because its price was lower than Jing rice. Although there were new foreign rice arrivals, the market was still lively. High-quality goods rose sharply by three to four jiao, while low-priced coarse rice and mid-grade machine Xian rice rose by five to six jiao. The number of transactions throughout the day also increased to over 5,000.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: The new Saigon rice arrived yesterday and was sampled in the market. However, as the local customer Xian rice was soaring, the owners were trying to maintain good prices and were unwilling to sell cheaply with the market. Therefore, many were not agreed upon. Only over 200 bags of Saigon rice were opened in the overall market, with prices of 22.3 yuan and 22.5 yuan, including feed.</p>
<p>Varied Yuan: Although the sales market was still not refreshing, all goods rose, and the market was driven up by two to three jiao. Statistics show that the total number of Jing Xian rice was over 30,000 bags, while the sources from all sides were limited. There were no arrivals in Hexia, and only 1,200 to 1,300 bags of Nan Dai goods arrived from Che Lun Bao Zi.</p>
<h3>Securities: Amidst the Four Sides of Chu's Songs, How Can Government Bonds Be Spared from the Falling Wind? Unified B Falls Miserably by Nine Jiao; Foreign Stocks' Buying Interest Almost Disappears</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities market suddenly started falling due to the strangely tight money supply. The Tianjin incident and the Sino-Japanese conference were feared to have no results, and everyone was even more uneasy about the legal currency issue. Foreign exchange and gold continued to rise tightly. The drip of water that is not stopped becomes a flood. The escape of Tianjin banknotes to Shanghai and cash became even more intense. Government bonds were in the four sides of Chu's songs. One wave was not over, and another wave rose. The multiple parties felt even more worried. Therefore, the money supply was strangely tight. A certain household was forced to leave the multi-headed position for some reason, and the market price suddenly tended to fall. If the issue of principal and interest and the rumored news of paying in exchange rates could be maintained, it is hoped that the authorities will formally announce the Sino-Japanese situation. Yesterday, at the initial opening, Yongfeng bought in, and Liaobin and Hengfu sold slightly. The market price was small in February and March, which was fairly stable. Subsequently, there was a large amount of sales on the 16th, especially in type B. Yuanda sold out and weakened, and the market price fell. Although Bensin and Xieda still had demand, Datong, Shuntai, and Renchang still sold, so the result fell sharply by more than one yuan to two yuan compared to the previous day. The total number of transactions was approximately 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 58.00 57.30 57.30 Down 1.10 Unified B 49.10 47.40 47.40 Another 1.90 Unified C 47.60 46.45 46.45 Another 1.35</p>

<p>Stock transactions: 50 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 8.35 yuan. The Shanghai Public Exchange reported that the buying wave of the previous day had almost disappeared yesterday. There was also a large number of public multi-heads closed out, causing prices to fall. Jardine shares had more selling interest, and the price fell from 19.7 jiao to 19.1 jiao, with the changed price being the closing selling price. Kaiping shares rose to 37 yuan, but returned to 36.5 yuan at the closing. Tram shares had good demand, and closed with buying prices of 42.25 yuan to 42.5 yuan. The rubber market situation was mixed, and the prices of various shares were also different. One or two tickets were traded by those who needed cash, and buyers obtained them at a low price.</p>

<h3>Oil Cakes: Raw Oil Soars by a Huge Three Yuan</h3>
<p>The oil market was affected by the soaring gold bonds and the continued strange exchange rate the other day, causing the market price to turn from falling to rising. Yesterday, peanut oil was suddenly inquired about by Hong Kong merchants, causing the upward trend to be uniquely healthy, soaring by three yuan compared to the previous market. A total of 500 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded, with prices ranging from 37 yuan to 37.5 yuan. Another 1,700 cans of new canned oil were traded at a price of 50 yuan. 120 barrels of Qingzao barrel oil were traded, with the price rising from 47.5 yuan to 48.2 jiao.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Speculation Concentrates, Yarn Prices Rise Frequently; Double Horse Creates a New High Price, Reaching 521 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the momentum remained strong. Speculators were particularly keen on buying. At the same time, in South China, Hong Kong merchants were purchasing a large amount of 20-count and 21-count yarn such as Double Horse, and 23-count yarn such as Golden Rooster, Five Blessings, and Shepherd, and the appetite remained healthy, totaling 470 bales. Yunnan imported 125 bales of 10-count coarse yarn. In this enthusiastic atmosphere, rumors were rife in the market, all favorable to the multiple parties, and the buying wind was still strong. The market continued to advance towards a higher peak. The upward strength of 20-count Double Horse was getting stronger and stronger. General operators were using it as a tool, so the range of fluctuations expanded. The highest reached 521 yuan. The highest price for Double Horse on June 19 was 510 yuan, so it has now risen by more than 10 yuan. As for unpopular yarn, transactions were lacking, and the selling price remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The current yarn market situation: The market trended upward at the start of the morning. It was generally said that exchange drafts were still likely to shrink, and there were many buyers. Asking prices rose by three to four hundred yuan. The list price of 20-count Double Horse stack was 502 yuan, and it immediately rose by three yuan, reaching 505 yuan. The spot price was 510 yuan. Shortly after, gold merchants and securities merchants came to buy yarn, and the price immediately jumped, with calling prices rising one after another. The highest spot price for 20-count Double Horse foreign stack was 521 yuan, and the stack list price was 510 yuan. Some holders sold out to take profits, and it fell back down by three yuan. By the closing, it had recovered slightly by one or two yuan. According to statistics, 1,440 bales were traded in half a day. Among the yarn types, 20-count Double Horse rose by 12 yuan alone, Shepherd rose by 3.5 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn rose by 10 yuan. Currently, 900 pieces of various cotton yarns are being shipped to Haiphong, 170 pieces are being shipped to Beihai, 335 pieces are being shipped to Guangzhou Bay, 2,760 pieces are being shipped to Hong Kong, 21 pieces are being shipped to Xiamen, 100 pieces are being shipped to Tianjin, 85 pieces are being shipped to Yantai, and 3 pieces are being shipped to Qingdao. However, Japanese yarn accounts for the majority. Hong Kong: 470, Shantou: 25, Quanzhou: 30, Yunnan: 125, Wenzhou: 25, Colleagues: 745, Mainland: 20, Total: 1,440</p>
<p>Japanese Yarn Market: Seeing progress is actually for spot sales. In addition, exchange premiums are strangely high, and there is no way out, so the selling price of spot yarn is flat. The current offering price for 20-count Yueqin is 412 yuan, but the price for the next month is smart and all contains speculative characteristics.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Cotton Transactions Move Slightly, Market Rises by Six, Seven, and Eight Yuan; US Cotton Export Subsidies Have Not Yet Been Resolved</h3>
<p>Transactions in the Chinese and foreign cotton market have begun to develop. The factory made an advance purchase of 500 bales of Changyin sand cotton from the Xinyu factory at a price of 100 yuan delivered to the factory, which is 4 to 5 yuan higher than before the exchange rate changed. However, later batches of the same industry also transacted 150 bales, plus 2 yuan. As for foreign cotton companies, they have also begun to buy and sell each other, transacting 400 pieces. It is also reported that foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai have become even quieter since the exchange rate plummeted the other day and the spot yarn premium has risen again. Factory parties are finding it more difficult to allocate funds, and some of the foreign cotton previously ordered that have not yet been shipped are planning to settle prices with foreign firms. Although the Indian cotton market has been falling continuously in recent days, the gains in exchange rates offset any profits by about six yuan per dan. There have been several settlements yesterday. Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was weak from the beginning. A cable from Liverpool reported a decline, causing the multiple heads to settle. The industry is also turning to a wait-and-see attitude towards the cotton market because the issue of US cotton export subsidies has not been resolved. Subsequently, cotton prices fell due to improved weather in the cotton-growing regions and selling short in the south. As a result, the closing price was eight to ten pounds lower than the previous day. The Indian cotton market was flat, with overall predictions slightly rising by half a rupee. Egypt rose by eight pounds.</p>
<h3>Textile Trade: Exchange Rate Fluctuations Increase Cloth Prices</h3>
<p>The cloth market in the nation is in a tense state as foreign exchange shrinks again. However, the current cash discount rate has also soared to unprecedented highs. Although fellow traders have high hopes, they are constrained by a lack of spot cash and tight funds. Therefore, the prices of all goods sold for cash have held steady at their original levels. Prices for goods settled through exchange transfers are based on the price at the money exchange, which is a significant increase of seven to eight yuan compared to the previous day. This indicates that public confidence remains stable, but the excessively high prices may hinder sales for manufacturers. 273 bales of Tonghua cloth from northern Jiangsu have arrived again. Today, 95 bales of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong. The current cotton situation is listed below.</p>
<p>Changyin Sand: 102.00, 150 bales purchased by fellow traders through exchange transfer at the money exchange.</p>
<p>White Cloth: 97.00, 200 bales purchased by fellow traders through cash at the money exchange.</p>
<p>Ordinary New Special: 81.00, 200 bales purchased by fellow traders through cash at the money exchange.</p>
<p>American Packing: 101.50, 100 bales purchased by fellow traders through exchange transfer at the money exchange.</p>
<p>Changyin Sand: 100.00, 500 bales purchased by the Xinyu Factory through exchange transfer for factory use.</p>
<p>The sales prices of all cloths have risen uniformly. Colored cloth and colored twill have increased by 2.5 to 5 jiao per bolt, fine cloth and fine twill have increased by 1 to 2.5 jiao per bolt, and coarse cloth and coarse twill have increased by 0.5 to 2.5 jiao per bolt. However, due to the high discount rate, goods priced in exchange transfers are still cheaper than those priced in cash. Therefore, yesterday, fellow traders and hoarders chose to settle 70% through exchange transfers and 30% in cash, leading to tighter procurement of various goods. Over 200 bales of fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth were traded. Guangdong and Yunnan brokers purchased 100 bales of fine twill and fine cloth. Over 100 bales of dyed fine twill were purchased in this street. Conversely, transactions for goods priced in cash have slowed down. Many hoarders are converting their existing cash into exchange transfers to hoard goods. Due to the sudden rise in sales prices, there have been few transactions in the colored cloth market. Retail sales in this street have been sluggish due to the impact of wind and rain.</p>
<p>In the eastern cloth market, the customer interest in white fine cloth and fine twill waned yesterday due to the surge in cash discounts, leading to a decline in sales prices. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth once fell below the 14 yuan mark, closing at 14.1 yuan at noon. The price for the current month is 14.2 yuan. It is rumored that Japanese firms are also facing tight credit and are continuously selling Qingdao fine cloth at low prices to raise cash. Yesterday, "Magpie Brand" fine cloth was priced at 13.6 yuan and "Flower Island" fine cloth at 13.4 yuan. Local traders were hesitant to purchase. Brokers from Qinhuangdao continue to procure 200 bales of "Dragon Head" fine cloth. According to traders, if the discount can be reduced slightly, the cloth market's upward trend will remain strong.</p>
<p>Exports: Today, 22 bolts of cloth were shipped to Qingdao, 25 bolts to Yantai, 70 bolts to Tianjin, 25 bolts to Xiamen, 120 bolts to Hong Kong, 35 bolts to Guangzhou Bay, 15 bolts to Beihai, and 560 bolts to Haiphong.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Sudden Exchange Rate Fluctuations Cause Silk Prices to Rise; Signs of Disorder</h3>
<p>The silk market continued to rise yesterday. White Factory B was selling at 2560 yuan, and some were even selling at 2680 yuan. However, the former price seems more reliable, while the latter may be for higher-grade white silk. The disordered pricing of silk is evident here. Filature silk is also rising sharply. Yesterday, six grades of Qilin Running Horse were selling at 1460 yuan, an increase of 250 yuan in two days. However, there were few transactions, as the raw silk inventory is depleted and the future of raw materials is uncertain. Furthermore, the future development of the legal tender is a topic of much debate. Therefore, most prudent merchants are taking a wait-and-see approach. International silk prices are also rising. In the American market, New York spot raw silk rose by 5 cents, Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk rose by 3 cents, recent standard silk rose by 3 cents, and forward silk rose by 4 cents. Yokohama spot prices fell by 15 yuan in the morning and rose by 1 yuan at closing. This rise in silk prices is due to the sudden contraction of exchange reserves, so there is little impact abroad. Active sales are beyond doubt.</p>
<h3>Green Tea Transactions Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, transactions for foreign firms' green tea were quite sluggish. Most tea factories are hesitant to purchase due to high costs, resulting in low inventories. High-quality goods are largely unavailable. Only Xiehe, Jinlong, and other firms purchased 270 boxes of medium-to-low grade Zhen Mei tea. Select Zhen Mei was selling for 305 to 320 yuan, ordinary Zhen Mei for 250 to 265 yuan, and Xi Zhen Mei for 545 yuan, with prices remaining stable.</p>

<h3>New Hurricane Lands at Hangzhou Bay and Advances Rapidly; Hits Shanghai This Morning; Storm Surge Turns Low-Lying Areas into Waterlands; Shipping in Shanghai and Other Areas Suspended; High Tide Combined with Hurricane Could Cause Severe Flooding</h3>
<p>A new hurricane that formed in Luzon Island in the Pacific Ocean was initially moving due north, so it was not taken seriously. However, from 2 PM the day before yesterday, the Xujiahui Observatory reported that the hurricane's direction had shifted from due north to a north-northwest trend, and its speed was very fast, traveling 120 nautical miles in the eight hours from 6 AM to 2 PM that day. This began to draw attention. At 6 AM yesterday, the Xujiahui Observatory reported that the hurricane had reached 26 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees east longitude, with the center of the storm within a 60-nautical-mile radius. The direction suddenly shifted to a rapid northwest advance. According to the reported position, it was west of Naha Island in the Ryukyu Islands, only 300 nautical miles from Shanghai, heading directly for the city.</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" stated that Shanghai is predicted to experience stronger winds, rain, and hurricane-force conditions tonight (the 19th) and tomorrow (the 20th), as the hurricane is rapidly approaching Shanghai. From 6 AM yesterday (the 18th) to 6 AM this morning, the hurricane advanced at a rate of 18 nautical miles. If it maintains this speed, it is expected to reach Hangzhou Bay off the coast of Zhejiang tonight. It is reported that the hurricane's center reached 26 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees east longitude within 60 miles at 6 AM this morning, with the wind direction being northwest.</p>
<p>Hanging Ball Warning</p>
<p>After receiving the report from Xujiahui Observatory, the Jianghai Customs immediately hung a black ball on the Bund New Customs Wharf and the Customs Wharf on Weituoma Road at 2 PM to warn of the hurricane approaching Shanghai and to prohibit any ships from entering or leaving the Huangpu River. Civilian ships and sailboats were all ordered to sail to the Lujiazui area of Pudong to seek shelter from the wind.</p>
<p>Approaching Shanghai</p>
<p>The observatory reported at 2 PM yesterday that the hurricane had reached 27 degrees north latitude and 124 degrees east longitude, with the center within a 60-nautical-mile radius. The direction remained northwest, and the wind was very strong. At that time, the hurricane was only 280 nautical miles from Shanghai and was continuing to advance rapidly towards the city.</p>
<p>Adding Black Balls</p>
<p>By 4 PM yesterday, the observatory reported that the hurricane had reached 27 degrees 30 minutes north latitude and 123 degrees 43 minutes east longitude, with the center still within a 60-nautical-mile radius, moving in a northwest or north-northwest direction. According to the reported position, the hurricane was only 160 nautical miles from Shanghai, making it inevitable that the city would be hit. The Jianghai Customs added another black ball (two in total) to the roof and the wharf on Xian Tuoma Road to warn that the hurricane was about to hit Shanghai.</p>
<p>Force Eight Winds</p>
<p>The hurricane hitting Shanghai had a wind force of about seven to eight yesterday afternoon. Shanghai has experienced swirling winds and showers since early yesterday morning, indicating initial disturbances from the hurricane. The wind became stronger and the showers heavier in the afternoon, with few pedestrians on the roads and sluggish business in stores. However, traffic was not significantly affected as of 8 PM last night. The Huangpu River was very quiet, and all kinds of ships had ceased operations.</p>
<p>Hits Shanghai This Morning</p>
<p>If the hurricane continues to advance rapidly in a north-west or north-northwest direction, it will hit Shanghai between midnight last night and early this morning. Furthermore, there will be a high tide in the Huangpu River between 2 AM and 3 AM today. If this coincides with the hurricane, the water level will rise sharply, and the tide may overflow the banks along the Bund, while low-lying roads will inevitably be flooded.</p>
<p>Shipping Suspended</p>
<p>The American President Lines' President Coolidge, which came to Shanghai from the United States, was delayed due to the hurricane and arrived at 2:30 PM yesterday, berthing at buoys 11 and 12. Passengers disembarked in sequence. The ship was originally scheduled to depart at 10 AM this morning for Hong Kong and Luzon. Yesterday, the company stated that to avoid danger due to the hurricane, the ship would depart at 5 PM today if the wind subsided slightly. The small ferry for passengers was scheduled to depart from the New Customs Wharf at 3:30 PM. The Far Eastern Company's Hana, which was originally scheduled to sail the Shanghai-Ningbo route, returned to Shanghai at about 3 PM yesterday and is scheduled to depart for Ningbo tomorrow (the 21st), so it is not affected by the hurricane. The Hainan Company's Yangtze River, which left Shanghai for Dinghai, Wan Dai Shan, and Sanmen Bay yesterday afternoon, was forced to anchor at buoy 31 to avoid the hurricane due to its small size. The ship had more than 80 passengers on board, and the company sent a small ferry to buoy 31 to allow passengers who did not wish to wait on board to return to Shanghai. It is reported that the Yangtze River did not have adequate food supplies for the passengers, so they will likely disembark to wait for the hurricane to pass before re-boarding the ship. The Great Britain Company's Sudan mail ship was detained by the Japanese army at Dagu Kou for half a month. Yesterday, the company said that the issue had been resolved and the ship had left Tianjin for Shanghai, expected to arrive at 6 PM today, berthing at buoys 13 and 14 to load passengers and cargo, and scheduled to depart for Europe on the 21st (Friday) at 3 PM. However, as the hurricane also affected the sea, it is uncertain whether the ship will arrive on time. Ships sailing the lower reaches of the Yangtze River usually return to Shanghai after 3 or 4 PM, but none arrived yesterday, and there will be no ships departing today. There were no ships arriving from the north or south yesterday. Today, the Shandong will arrive from Qingdao and the Zesheng will arrive from Hong Kong. The departing ships include the Guisheng for Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Fuzhou, and Tianjin, the Jinan for Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Haiphong, and the Fusheng for Hong Kong. Whether they can depart as scheduled depends on the wind conditions today. It is still uncertain whether the Blue Funnel Line's Antena (transliteration) will arrive from Liverpool, England today. Last night, two red lights were still hanging high on the roof of the Customs clock tower.</p>
<p>Another Waterland</p>
<p>From yesterday afternoon, storm winds and rain hit the city again. For a time, the wind was terrifying and the rain poured down, not stopping all night. At the same time, the high tide in the Huangpu River rose again, turning low-lying roads in the Public Settlement and the French Concession into waterlands. Roads such as Guangxi Road, Fuzhou Road, Zhejiang Road, Difeng Road, Jishi Ferry Road, Xiafei Road, Saporro Road, Ximen Road, and Malang Road were all flooded. At 5:45 PM, a section of power line on the French Damalu Xixin Bridge was suddenly blown down and broken, but fortunately no one was injured. It was quickly repaired.</p>
<p>Hurricane and High Tide Coincidence Concerning</p>
<p>According to the research of Dr. Chaddleigh (British), the former chief engineer of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, although the summer and autumn seasons are the times when hurricanes are most likely to hit Shanghai, the chance of coinciding with the time of high tide in the Huangpu River is not very high, only one in ten opportunities on average. Therefore, knowing the above situation, it is known that Shanghai's considerable flooding caused by hurricanes is not common, only occurring once every few years.</p>
<p>Huangpu River Water Flow Smooth</p>
<p>This year's Huangpu River water conservancy situation is far from comparable to the situation before the war. The dredging work of the Huangpu River has completely stopped. The smooth flow of the Huangpu River is due to the dredging bureau's year-round hard work in dredging, so the rising and falling tides can quickly advance and retreat with the tide.</p>
<p>Disadvantages After Loss of Dredging</p>
<p>It has been two years since the Huangpu River was dredged. Water flow is stagnant, which is inevitable. In the event of a hurricane, the water level of the Huangpu River will inevitably be raised by the wind force, and the amount of water accumulated on the ground due to heavy rain will not be able to be quickly absorbed and discharged by the drains, even if it is quickly absorbed and discharged with the receding tide, it will be slow. These are all inevitable situations and worth noting.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Replies to Chamber of Commerce Again: Copper Auxiliary Coin Notes Being Rushed to Print; Two Denominations: One Fen and Five Fen</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to quickly arrange relief measures for the severe shortage of copper coins in the city. Although various sectors are using stamps and revenue stamps as substitutes, it is ultimately inconvenient. The Chamber also received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance in response, stating that it was rushing to print auxiliary coin notes. The Chamber received another telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "Your telegram received. The Ministry has approved the urgent shortage of copper auxiliary coins in Shanghai and has ordered the Central Bank to urgently print and issue one-fen and five-fen auxiliary coin notes to provide relief. Please be informed."</p>
<h3>North China Banknotes Being Exchanged as Much as Possible; Foreign Exchange Stabilizes Yesterday; Rumors Subside and Market Confidence Eases; However, Gold Rises and Discount Fever Intensifies</h3>
<p>Reuters London, 19th: The "Financial News" published an article commenting on the renewed sharp decline in the value of Chinese legal tender, stating that the fact that the legal tender was allowed to depreciate again after a short period shows that although the Sino-British equalization fund has not been completely exhausted, there is little left. It is now up to the United Kingdom to decide whether to continue to assist China's foreign exchange. Sino-British financiers here are very puzzled by the overall decline in legal tender. However, it is generally agreed that the legal tender must be allowed to find its own level. The extent to which this level will reach is now a matter of conjecture, and will largely depend on the political and economic trends of the Chinese war.</p>
<p>Reuters London, 19th: According to Reuters, the issue of the United Kingdom continuing to support China's stabilization fund for legal tender has not yet arisen. However, the general opinion in London is that this support will be provided if necessary. Although some observers acknowledge that Chinese legal tender is affected by the trade deficit, they believe that there is another major influence, namely the success of the Japanese in exchanging large quantities of Federal Reserve banknotes for Chinese legal tender.</p>
<p>Black Market Foreign Exchange Gradually Stabilizes</p>
<p>After the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee restricted the supply to the Shanghai black market on the morning of the day before yesterday in order to prevent large-scale arbitrage of foreign exchange in the black market, the black market foreign exchange suddenly shrank sharply. However, after the British HSBC Bank agreed to provide as much as possible to meet the legitimate needs of various industries, the exchange rate began to stabilize, market rumors subsided slightly, and public confidence gradually eased. Yesterday morning, HSBC Bank's listed exchange rate for British pounds was five pence and for US dollars was 9.6875 yuan, and it agreed to provide as much as possible at the listed market price. British-American Tobacco Company and Mobil Oil Company, among others, purchased British and American foreign exchange from HSBC and Citibank.</p>
<p>Legitimate Industries Can Apply for Legal Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>A "New Voice News Agency" reporter learned from relevant sources yesterday that the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that for the import of essential goods, it is permissible to apply to the Foreign Exchange Review Committee for legal foreign exchange. The customs offices in various places have been ordered to investigate and ban luxury goods, but because the situation in Shanghai is special, luxury goods can still be imported as before. However, since foreign exchange can not be applied to these goods legally, they have to be purchased from the Shanghai black market. The prices of black market foreign exchange have shrunk sharply after the restrictions, and speculators and importers of luxury goods have been hit hard, while legitimate merchants have not been affected in any way.</p>
<p>Tianjin Banknotes Exchanged as Much as Possible</p>
<p>Regarding the banknotes with Tianjin place names, after the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications exchanged them as much as possible in small amounts, the number of people going to the two banks yesterday to request exchange was still crowded. They were all apprentices and partners of small money shops, because these small money shops specialized in collecting banknotes from Tianjin, charging a fee of five cents to two jiao per yuan. After collecting them, they went to exchange them, aiming to profit. However, in order to stabilize the market, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications still exchanged them as much as possible. As for the banknotes with place names from other places of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the China Industrial Bank, and other banks, they can also be exchanged at the designated Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and other banks.</p>
<p>Other Banks Fully Usable</p>
<p>After the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications exchanged Tianjin banknotes as much as possible, most banks and stores still refused to use them starting yesterday, but a few have been accepting them with flexibility. As for the banknotes of banks such as the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the China Industrial Bank, the China South Bank, the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, the Commercial Bank, the Siming Bank, and the Zhejiang Local Bank, they are fully usable in the market and are treated the same as legal tender, without discrimination, because these banknotes have long been taken over by the Issuing Reserve Committee and have full reserves, which is exactly the same as legal tender. Furthermore, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have telegraphed their head offices for instructions regarding the exchange of Tianjin banknotes, but have not yet received a reply.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Arbitrage Plan Fails</p>
<p>A "New Voice News Agency" reporter learned from banking circles yesterday that after the black market exchange rate in Shanghai shrank sharply, and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications selectively restricted the exchange of large amounts of Tianjin banknotes, the plan to transport banknotes from North China to Shanghai to arbitrage foreign exchange failed. If the rumor in the market that three to four million Tianjin banknotes were transported to Shanghai on a special ship from Shanhaiguan is true, then after arriving in Shanghai, they will not be able to be exchanged for legal tender with Shanghai place names, nor will they be able to arbitrage foreign exchange in the black market, because the difference between the black market exchange rate in Shanghai and the market price in North China Tianjin is very small. In fact, even if a huge profit is obtained,</p>
<p>Gold Continues to Rise and Discount Rate is High Again</p>
<p>Shanghai's gold gray market continued to rise yesterday after foreign exchange shrank sharply and cash soared the day before yesterday, reaching a high of 3,160 yuan. The listed price of Dalutong Bank was 320 yuan, and the listed price of Xintong Bank was 318 yuan. Furthermore, because the discount on exchange drafts is an improper business and does not comply with the Ministry of Finance's financial policy, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Trust Bureau have decided not to maintain it in the future. Therefore, the discount rate is manipulated by ordinary small money shops, taking advantage of the sharp contraction of the black market foreign exchange to deliberately monopolize it. Yesterday, it rose by 165 yuan, that is, 165 yuan per thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Impact on Public Debt Prices</p>
<p>Affected by the huge changes in the foreign exchange and cash markets, certificate holders sold public bonds to buy foreign exchange gold, so the market was oversupplied. The prices of various unified public debt bonds fell uniformly. Yesterday's closing market prices were: Unified Class A, 57.3 yuan, down 1.1 yuan; Class B, 47.4 yuan, down 1.9 yuan; Class C, 46.445 yuan, down 1.3 yuan; Class D, 45.9 yuan, down 1.05 yuan; Class E, 46 yuan, down 1.445 yuan.</p>
<p>Bank Association Meeting Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Industry Association's member banks are not fundamentally affected by the foreign exchange collapse, but it does have some impact on their business. In addition to maintaining calmness under the foreign exchange collapse the day before yesterday, they have been preparing a proper response, at one point stopping the supply of all foreign exchange. Yesterday, a banking source revealed that the Shanghai Banking Association will hold a routine meeting of the Executive Committee at its Hong Kong Road office at 3 PM today. At that time, the drastic changes in the foreign exchange market and the aftermath of the rejection of banknotes with North China place names will be discussed. Everything else will be brought up in the meeting.</p>
<h3>New Commander of US Fleet, the Herts Arrive in Shanghai; Changeover on the 25th; Yarnell to Return Home Next Month</h3>
<p>Admiral Yarnell, commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, who has been cruising in North China waters for nearly forty years, arrived in Shanghai on the flagship Augusta at 12:30 PM the day before yesterday, accompanied by his wife and Chief of Staff Connor. This is Commander Yarnell's last time in Shanghai, and Commander Yarnell came specifically to wait for the new commander, Rear Admiral Hert, for the changeover. As for the new commander</p>
<p>Rear Admiral and Mrs. Hert arrived in port at 2:30 PM yesterday on the President Coolidge, and the American naval community in the city went to the pier to meet them. Commander Yarnell sent a naval launch to welcome them. Rear Admiral and Mrs. Hert disembarked in the pouring rain. According to sources in the American Navy, the changeover</p>
<p>ceremony will be held on the aft deck of the Augusta flagship on the 25th of this month. The ship is currently docked at the head of the American ships in the Huangpu River. Although the whereabouts of the two commanders after the changeover are not yet certain, it is believed that they will stay in Shanghai temporarily for the first week of next month, then</p>
<p>go to North China for a visit. Commander Yarnell will stay in Shanghai for five or six days to say goodbye to friends before returning to the United States with his family on the President Coolidge on August 1st. The new commander, Rear Admiral Hert, is 62 years old this year, born in 1877 in Davis, Michigan, USA, and graduated from the</p>
<p>Naval Academy. He was promoted to Rear Admiral in 1929 and served as Chairman of the General Board of the Navy Department in Washington in 1935 before recently leaving office. He participated in the Spanish World War and both made special achievements. It is reported that Rear Admiral and Mrs. Hert will temporarily reside in the thirteen-bed mansion on Ya'erbe Road in the French Concession, where Commander Yarnell resides.</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" stated that Admiral Yarnell, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, has been cruising the waters of North China for more than six weeks and returned to Shanghai (the 18th) on his flagship Augusta yesterday. This is Admiral Yarnell's last visit to Shanghai as commander. His successor, Admiral Hart, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the President Coolidge</p>
<p>from Washington today (the 19th). Upon the ship's arrival, Admiral Hart will immediately board a naval launch to the Customs Wharf and go to his residence on land. It is heard that Admiral Hert will reside ashore before taking over as commander of the Asiatic Fleet on July 25th. Information was not available in the city last night regarding his future plans, but it is generally believed that he</p>
<p>will remain in the city until the first week of August before departing for North China. According to records, Rear Admiral Hert served in the Asiatic Fleet fifteen years ago as the commander of one of the two submarines stationed in the Orient. The submarine transported him far to Qingdao. Two decades ago, he served as Chairman of the General Board of the Navy Department</p>
<p>and just left his position. Admiral Hert is originally from Davis, Michigan, and graduated from the Naval Academy in Annapolis in 1899. After leaving office, Admiral Yarnell will remain in the city for five or six days to say goodbye to friends and is expected to depart for the United States on the President Coolidge on August 1st.</p>
<h3>Discovered Near Airport: Regular Chinese Army</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" stated that guerrilla teams have been fighting around Shanghai for many months. Today, it is heard that Shanghai Chinese have seen regular troops in military uniform wearing the Blue Sky White Sun emblem not far from Hongqiao Airport. There have been very few Japanese troops in the Hongqiao area in recent days, which has caused a lot of attention. Only a small team of Japanese soldiers is occasionally seen passing by on foot or in a car. It is generally believed that most of the Japanese troops have retreated to nearby areas for "exercises" and to search for people suspected of being guerrillas, which is why gunshots have been heard repeatedly in the area.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province: Important Meetings</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province recently held two important meetings, one was the Zhejiang West Party and Government Joint Conference, and the other was the Provisional Senate, to discuss promoting wartime military and political party affairs in order to benefit the war of resistance. Both have now closed.</p>
<p>Party and Government Joint Conference</p>
<p>After holding a general meeting for three days, the conference resolved the following cases: (1) Local party departments and military party departments should closely coordinate; (2) Expand the organization of local team party departments; (3) Promote civil movement work in various counties in guerrilla areas, enhance the strength of the war of resistance; (4) Launch wartime education and smash enslavement education; (5) Strengthen wartime mobilization institutions and unify wartime training; (6) Establish farmers' supply offices in various counties in guerrilla areas; (7) Purchase silk cocoons and tea leaves in guerrilla areas; (8) Unify the work pace of various patriotic groups in the war zone; (9) Party, government, and military agencies in the war zone should be effectively linked. All were passed.</p>
<p>Provincial Senate</p>

<h3>Japanese Navy's Attempt to Breach Jiaojiang Fails; Blockade Line Troops Bravely Repulse Attack; Wintai Defense Commander Orders Evacuation</h3>
<p>The Jiaojiang Estuary in Taizhou Bay, Zhejiang Province, has been thoroughly blockaded by military authorities to prevent any ships from sailing. Mines have been laid there, and additional troops have been stationed to strengthen coastal defenses. As a result, the Japanese army has repeatedly attempted to make incursions, but without success. However, on the 15th of this month, two Japanese warships arrived off the Jiaojiang Estuary and launched motorboats carrying dozens of Japanese naval personnel. Under the cover of Japanese aircraft, they attempted to break through the blockade line. The defending naval forces bravely responded with intense machine-gun fire, inflicting heavy damage. The Japanese boats, unable to withstand the attack, retreated. Their attempt to land also failed. The Japanese aircraft then dropped four bombs on the Haimen Fortress, but no damage was sustained by the Chinese side.</p>

<h3>Japan Notifies Consular Body, Plans to Blockade Northern Fujian, Demanding Foreign Merchants, Warships, and Nationals Evacuate from Three Locations: Sandu Ao, Luoyuan, and Shacheng</h3>
<p>Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura, sent a message to the consular body here on the 12th of this month, stating that the Japanese side would begin military operations in Quanzhou, Tongshan, and Zhao'an in Fujian Province from July 15th, requesting all ships of third countries, including warships, to leave the three ports immediately, and asking nationals of third countries in the three locations to evacuate. In response, the British side asserted the right of British people to reside in and travel to these locations. Unexpectedly, the Japanese naval authorities, citing military operations, are now planning to blockade three locations in northern Fujian: Sandu Ao, Luoyuan, and Shacheng. Therefore, on the 18th, the Japanese consul notified the consular body in this port of their intention, requesting again that commercial ships and warships of third countries leave the three ports before 8:00 AM (Japanese time) on July 21st, or they might face danger. The announcement stated: (1) The Japanese navy will initiate military operations against Sandu Ao and Luoyuan at 8:00 AM (Japanese time) on July 21st. Warships and ships of third countries along the two locations must evacuate before the deadline. As for Shacheng in northern Fujian, it will be blockaded from 2:00 PM (Japanese time) on July 22nd. All ships, warships, and residents of third countries must also evacuate on time. After the Japanese navy implements the blockade, no one is</p>
<p>allowed to exit these ports, otherwise they will suffer direct damage for which the Japanese side will not be responsible. (2) Obstacles and dangerous objects will be placed near (A) Zhangjiaozui (Chown Point), which connects Sandu Ao and Luoyuan, (B) the connecting line between Nanguanshan and Pingfengshan in Shacheng. (3) The areas near the above harbors will be combat zones, and nationals of third countries should evacuate as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>National Bonds Accepted for Loan Collateral; Remittance Drafts Will Be Paid; Shanghai Awaits Instructions; Discounting as a Temporary Measure</h3>
<p>The principal and interest of domestic and foreign debts due on July 31st by the National Government include: (1) the 1915 Sino-French-American Gold Loan, (2) the 1928 Sino-Belgian Gold Loan, (3) the 1934 Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Loan, (4) the 1913 Reorganization Loan, (5) five types of the 1936 National Unification Bonds (A, B, C, D, and E). The above are secured by customs revenue. (6) The Tianjin-Pukou Railway Development Company Loan, secured by salt tax. In addition, there are bonds managed by the Ministry of Transportation: (7) the 1905 Daokou-Qinghua Railway Loan, (8) the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Car Purchase Promissory Notes, (9) the 1904 Zhuluo Railway Loan, (10) the 1913 Longhai Railway Loan, (11) the 1924 Longhai Railway 8% Loan, (12) the 1925 Longhai Short-Term Loan, (13) the Longhai Belgian-Dutch Loan.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Prescribes Repayment Methods</p>
<p>In view of the seizure of salt and customs revenues, the Ministry of Finance has successively announced that it will no longer provide overdrafts for debts secured by salt and customs revenues. When tax revenues are allocated and delivered to the Inspector General of Customs as before, the government will simultaneously allocate funds for debt repayments as before to restore the pre-war situation.</p>
<p>Seventh Installment of Principal and Interest of the National Unification Bonds</p>
<p>As of July 1, 1939, the outstanding principal of the 1936 National Unification Bonds is: (1) Type A: 141,750,000 yuan, (2) Type B: 145,500,000 yuan, (3) Type C: 339,500,000 yuan, (4) Type D: 533,500,000 yuan, (5) Type E: 252,200,000 yuan. The seventh installment of principal and interest will be paid by the Central Bank and its entrusted Bank of China and Bank of Communications on July 31st, in accordance with the regulations. However, since customs revenue has been seized and the government no longer provides overdrafts, this debt secured by customs revenue, like foreign debts secured by customs revenue, has been temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Four Banks Offer Discounts and Loans</p>
<p>To stabilize the market, the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank are offering discounts and loans on the seventh installment of principal and interest of the National Unification Bonds and have decided to start issuing "discount certificates" from July 31st. However, although Shanghai has been divided into six installments, the issue of remittance drafts and cash has been referred to the head office for instructions. According to inquiries from the New Voice News Agency to the banking sector, to prevent legal tender from flowing into occupied areas, Shanghai general-purpose remittance drafts will be issued instead.</p>
<h3>Pawnshops Discuss Lowering Interest Rates</h3>
<p>The members of the Shanghai Pawnshop Trade Association are divided into old and new businesses. Old businesses operate in the Chinese-controlled area, while new businesses operate in the concession areas, with separate associations. Government orders are communicated and implemented through the old business association. Considering the soaring prices in the city, which greatly affect the livelihood of ordinary people, the association authorities proposed lowering pawn interest rates at the recent members' meeting to set an example and curb price increases. After discussion, it was decided to temporarily postpone the proposal due to the difficulty of reducing interest rates for both old and new businesses. According to inquiries from the Daguang News Agency to the trade association, the opinions of old and new businesses are generally the same, but the procedures are very complicated and cannot be implemented immediately. The trade association is currently exchanging views on this good deed, and it can be implemented at any time once a concrete decision is made. According to the proposal, the legal interest rate of 1.8% per month would be reduced to 1.6%. However, the number of pawnshops in Shanghai has recently increased dramatically, and interest rates are more than double those of pawnshops. It would be fortunate for the general public if the responsible authorities could compel these pawnshops to reduce their interest rates to the same level as pawnshops.</p>
<h3>British Naval Authorities Send Ships to Strengthen Defense of Chinese Coast, Ships to Temporarily Dock in Hong Kong Waters, Action Intended to Protect Nationals</h3>
<p>To protect nationals in various coastal areas of China, the British naval authorities have sent the warship HMS Delight to Xiamen to relieve HMS Dumnonius. HMS Dumnonius has been transferred to Hong Kong, and the shallow-draught gunboat HMS Bee, gunboat HMS Scarab, and submarine HMS Pandora have been dispatched to temporarily dock in Hong Kong waters. In addition, HMS Duchess has been ordered to proceed to Weihaiwei to protect nationals, while HMS Folkestone and HMS Diana have also been dispatched to Shantou and Fuzhou, respectively.</p>
<h3>Cash vs. Remittance Drafts Cause Legal Dispute; Plaintiff Sues for Land Rent and Requests Payment in Cash</h3>
<p>Since the advent of discounting methods in the financial market, there have been gains and losses between paying in cash and paying in remittance drafts. Therefore, such disputes in the market seem unavoidable. However, there have been no reports of such disputes being brought to court to seek a clear ruling on which form of payment should be the consideration. However, the case of lawyer Zhu Wenming, who also manages rental properties, suing Hengchang Company for arrears in land rent is an exception. According to the plaintiff's complaint to the civil division of the First Special District Court, Hengchang Company owes more than 850 yuan in land rent for one term. Judge Ni Zheng'ao heard the case yesterday afternoon. Zhu Wenming appeared in court and requested a judgment for the defendant to repay the full amount and declared provisional execution. He also requested that the defendant be ordered to pay in cash, stating that Hengchang Company had previously paid rent in remittance drafts, and the plaintiff suffered losses from discounting each time. Therefore, if the court still orders the defendant to pay in national currency, they will inevitably pay in remittance drafts, and the plaintiff will suffer losses again. Therefore, he requested that the judgment be changed to require payment in legal tender, removing the words "national currency" to avoid complications in future enforcement. Part of the dispute in this case is the difference between "national currency" and "legal tender". The verdict has not yet been announced and will be delivered at a later date.</p>
<h3>Gang of Thieves Apprehended in Jiangsu Hotel, Two Handguns Confiscated</h3>
<p>Shao Jingfan, a Chinese detective of the Chengdu Road Police Station, learned that a gang of thieves was hiding and plotting robbery in Room 100 of the Jiangsu Hotel at No. 50, Lane 379, Guangdong Road. Therefore, at around 7:00 AM on the 18th, he led Chinese and foreign detectives to secretly raid the address and arrested Zhu Zhangqing from Haimen, Zhu Juxiang (aka Chenxi) from Shanghai, Cai Futing (aka Cai Hong) from Pudong, Ding Chuanlin, and three others.

Subsequently, Zhang Gen from Pudong was arrested at No. 31, Lane 299, Seymour Road, and Xu Baosheng (aka Zhu Zhongyun) from Shanghai was arrested at No. 88, Lane 636, Xiaoshadu Road. One handgun and four bullets were confiscated. All were taken to the police station for detention and were sent to the Second Division of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, described the situation of the bust and requested permission to detain the suspects for 14 days for further investigation. After Judge Liu Yugui questioned the suspects, he granted permission for detention for two weeks for further verification.</p>
<h3>Husband and Wife Commit Suicide in Yangtze Hotel</h3>
<p>Li Xu, a 29-year-old traveler from Ningbo, and his wife, Xia, 26, checked into Room 319 on the third floor of the Yangtze Hotel on Hankou Road the night before last (the 18th). After paying for the room, they locked themselves in. It was not until around noon yesterday that the tea boy discovered that the couple in the room had both taken poison. He immediately reported it to the hotel manager, who called for an ambulance. They were rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is reported that Xia is beyond medical help, while Li Xu's life is still in danger. It was later learned that Li had no regular job and had incurred heavy gambling debts, leaving him with no way to make amends, leading him to this desperate measure.</p>
<h3>Bomb Explodes in Hollywood Gambling Den, Wounding Toilet Attendant</h3>
<p>At around 8:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 18th), a loud explosion occurred in the Western-style toilet of the famous "Hollywood" gambling den on Yuyuan Road in Western Shanghai. When the gambling den's staff rushed to investigate, they saw that one of the attendants cleaning the toilet had been injured by the explosion and was lying on the ground. The gambling den immediately reported it to the Japanese military police headquarters and the "Police Bureau" in Western Shanghai. The investigation revealed that someone had placed an incendiary bomb there in advance, hoping to cause an explosion and start a fire. However, the toilet had very little wooden structure, making it difficult to ignite. The gambling den is keeping this matter very secret.</p>
<h3>Extortion Case Against Elementary School Principal; Three Defendants Await Sentencing</h3>
<p>Yao Tingsen, a 29-year-old Shanghai native who works as a translator for the Public Concession Police, colluded with Yue Qiuxin, a young Cantonese man living with him, at the instigation of Xu Hao, a teacher at Hengmao Elementary School in Hengmao Lane, Baxianqiao, to impersonate officials from the French Municipal Council's Engineering Department. Accompanied by a Russian named Mr. So-and-So, they approached Yang Guoping, the principal of Hengmao Elementary School, claiming that he had failed to obtain a permit for the mezzanine floor and extorted 1,000 yuan. Yang's wife, Yuan, negotiated with them and agreed to pay 500 yuan, paying 350 yuan in advance, with the remainder to be delivered to the Central Hotel. As Yang was unable to raise the remaining funds by the deadline, Yao went to demand the money, and the impersonation and extortion were discovered. They reported it to the French police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Yao, Yue, and Xu. The police also found 120 yuan of the stolen money in the drawer of Yao's desk and 70 yuan on Yue's person. They were sent to the Second Special District Court for investigation and detention. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Minsheng continued the trial in the First Criminal Division. The defendants hired lawyer Zhu Yisheng for their defense. Yao Juyi, a lawyer from the French Concession administration, presented the case, charging them with impersonating public officials and obtaining money through fraud. The plaintiff, Yang Yuan, then testified about the circumstances of the fraud. Yao confessed that Xu Hao had told him that the principal owed him wages and asked him to collect the money, leading him to be fooled and go there. Yue's testimony was the same. Xu admitted to instigating the crime. After the court ordered the opening of arguments, it announced the conclusion of the trial and scheduled sentencing for the 26th. The defendants were detained in the detention center.</p>
<p>Arts and Entertainment Broadcast Association Member Meeting Postponed</p>
<p>The Arts and Entertainment Broadcast Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizen Group originally scheduled a member meeting at Shanghai High School on Jing'an Temple Road at 10:00 AM yesterday morning, with a group photo session.

<h3>Apprentice Clerk from Money Exchange Loses 3,000 Yuan in Legal Tender in Robbery Outside Bank; Two Robbers Apprehended on the Spot, Stolen Goods Recovered</h3>
<p>Wang Qingpei from Shandong and Yao Zhengjin from Zhenjiang, recently driven to desperation, devised a sinister plan. The two prepared a bag of lime powder and a bag of counterfeit money and waited all day in front of the Guohua Bank on Henan Road. Whenever they saw someone withdrawing money, they planned to throw lime powder into the person's eyes, then seize the money and drop the bag of counterfeit money on the ground. Their intention was that after the victim discovered the robbery, seeing that the stolen money was still on the ground, they would rush to</p>
<p>pick up the money, and would not intend to pursue the robbers. However, the two had no suitable opportunity to strike. At 9:50 AM on the 18th, Gu Fanghua, an apprentice clerk from the Yikang Money Exchange at No. 263 Jiangxi Road, withdrew 3,000 yuan in legal tender from the Guohua Bank. Wang and Yao saw him and followed him. When they reached the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road, Yao threw the bag of lime powder at Gu's eyes, and Wang stepped forward to seize the money. Dropping the bag of counterfeit money on the ground, they planned to</p>
<p>flee in different directions. At that time, Gu shouted "Thief!" Tang Zengxiang, a Chinese detective stationed in the area by the General Police Station, detectives Zhu Xinjin and Wang Hairu, and Chinese police officers No. 2017 and No. 1426 rushed to the scene from all directions and apprehended the two robbers. The original stolen money was recovered from Wang's person. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, prosecuted them under Article 328 of the Criminal Code. As further investigation was required, he requested a postponement. After Judge Qian Hongye questioned them, he ordered them to be detained pending further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Female Fortune Teller Jiang Tianzhen Robbed While Answering a Call; Diamond Ring Worth 600 Yuan Stolen; Two Suspects Arrested and Sent to Court for Trial</h3>
<p>Jiang Tianzhen, a 23-year-old female fortune teller from Hangzhou, studied under the female fortune teller Ling Qing in her early years. She has been advertising her services in Room 511 of the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road for six years. However, she once worked as a dancer. When she goes out to tell fortunes, she wears a diamond ring worth 600 yuan and a gold watch, and her clothes are modern. This attracted the attention of robbers. A robber named Yao Guisheng had previously called Jiang Tianzhen to tell his fortune. He saw the dazzling diamond ring on Jiang's finger and conceived an evil plan. He colluded with Sun Wenzhong from Ningbo and a man named Mapi and rented Room 316 of the Far East Hotel under the name of Liu Shaogen. At 7:40 PM on the 8th of last month, they called Jiang Tianzhen by phone to come and tell their fortunes. After a while, Jiang answered the call and arrived. Sun Wenzhong came forward and asked her to tell their fortunes. After she finished, Sun, on the pretext of paying the 5-yuan fortune-telling fee, took out a handgun to threaten her. Mapi then used a Western-style shirt to tie Jiang to the water pipe. They then robbed her of a diamond ring, a watch, and more than 10 yuan in cash, worth a total of 717 yuan, and fled with the stolen goods. Jiang reported the robbery to the Zhabei Police Station, requesting an investigation. At 10:00 AM on the 18th, Ding Huaguo, a Chinese detective from the Xinzha Police Station, and detective Yin Zhanqing apprehended Sun Wenzhong at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Seymour Road. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, a police lawyer, presented the case, charging him with robbery under Article 330 of the Criminal Code and requesting a postponement. Jiang Tianzhen also filed a complaint about the robbery and identified the defendant as being present at the scene at the time. Sun Wenzhong confessed. The court ordered him to be detained pending further questioning in seven days. It is reported that the main culprit, Yao Guisheng, was arrested at No. 337, Lane 3, Xiaoshadu Road at 7:30 AM yesterday morning. He confessed that he pawned the diamond ring at the Hongxiang Jewelry Store on Xiafei Road for 460 yuan. Yao is being held for transfer to the court this morning.</p>
<h3>Man Falls to Death While Repairing Roof in the Rain</h3>

<h3>Mother and Children Drown in Huangpu River</h3>
<p>At 1:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 18th), a rowing boat from Dongchang Road Wharf in Pudong was about to land at the Yuhang Wharf in the French Concession. A middle-aged woman was holding a child in one arm and leading a six-year-old child with the other. Due to carelessness, the three fell into the Huangpu River together. The six-year-old child was rescued, but the woman and the child she was holding drowned. She was pregnant with another child. It was a tragic scene. The rescued child has been taken back to the police station by a detective from the Customs Water Patrol Police Station, awaiting identification by relatives. At 9:00 AM on the same morning, a modern-looking female corpse suddenly floated up from the Huangpu River at the corner of the Bund Garden. She was wearing a striped silk cheongsam, permed hair, and leather shoes. She was in her twenties. The body was taken away by the Transportation Bureau for burial.</p>

<h3>French Tramway Company Issues Second Batch of Scrip, Valid Until End of September</h3>
<p>The French Tramway Company in Shanghai previously issued scrip due to a shortage of copper coins. The validity period was set to expire at midnight on July 31st of this year. As the deadline is approaching and the new currency notes from the Ministry of Finance have not yet arrived in Shanghai, the company has issued a second batch of scrip, valid until midnight on September 30th of this year.</p>
<p>After the issuance of this scrip, passengers using postage stamps will be refused to reduce disputes. However, as the scrip is specified to be invalid after the expiration date, scrip holders hope that the company authorities can specify a redemption location, as the British Tramway Company did, to avoid undue losses.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at Liang Xinji Toothbrush Factory Resolved</h3>
<p>The Liang Xinji Toothbrush Factory's bristle-inserting department on Xujiahui Road in the French Concession has more than 400 female workers. Wages in the bristle-inserting department have always been better than in other factories. Recently, the price of bristles has risen, increasing fivefold compared to 1926. At the same time, the number of missing bristles discovered in the bristle-inserting department has increased daily. According to the factory's old rules, female workers are fined 3 to 6 cents for each mace of bristles missing. There were concerns that some unscrupulous female workers would rather pay the fine and intentionally cause shortages, thereby profiting from it. To prevent this, the factory has now stipulated that those who are missing more than 2 mace will be fined 6 cents to 30 cents per mace, and wages have been specially increased to show sympathy. However, some female workers prevented other female workers from working, intending to incite a strike. This was discovered by the French Concession Police, who immediately dispatched detectives to disperse the troublemakers. The remaining female workers resumed work, and the strike was resolved.</p>
<h3>Passenger at Ji Sheng Inn Arrested for Selling Opium; Opium Confiscated; Suspects Arrested; Each Will Be Punished According to the Severity of Their Crime</h3>
<p>Ye Yusi, a Chinese detective from the Anti-Narcotics Department of the Public Concession Police, and detectives Liu Zhaonian and Li Shugui, and detectives Guo Shouxin and Zhao Baosheng, learned that someone was secretly selling opium in Room 17 of the Ji Sheng Inn at No. 10, Lane 159, Fujian Road. They rushed to search the premises and arrested He Wenyi from Jiangyin and Zhang Rongbiao from Ningbo.</p>
<p>One hundred taels of opium were confiscated. After interrogation, it was revealed that another 16.5 taels of opium were confiscated at He's home at No. 11, Lane 132, Pike Road. Subsequently, Zhang Yunsheng from Jiangbei was arrested at the doorway of No. 18, Lane 270, Jing'an Temple Road, and 10 taels of opium, 1,590.91 yuan in legal tender, and several seals were confiscated. A 100-yuan check was also found. At the same time, Lu Jiagu, Liu Yongfa, Qian Meimei, and Yu Caoshi, all from Ningbo, who were smoking opium, were also arrested.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To Lawyer Wang Liwu,</p>
<p>Regarding the report in your newspaper about Teng Zijin handing over a property to the Zhenxing Company, the content stating that Zhenyu Company, managed by Liwu, had not obtained land rights and was unwilling to return the deposit is clearly inconsistent with the facts. Zhenxing Company originally had a plan to build a thousand houses in the French Concession. However, after the first batch of twenty-three houses was partially completed, the project was suddenly obstructed by new regulations promulgated by the French Municipal Council, leading to the inability to proceed with the second batch (the sixteen houses contracted by Teng Zijin and others). According to the contract between the two parties, Teng should also bear the losses. Since Zhenxing Company is a shareholder-owned entity, Liwu personally cannot take sole charge, which led to litigation in court. As for the land lease contract, the deposit receipt, the Municipal Council's land measurement receipt, and the fact that the land could not be developed and was subsequently subleased to others, all have been submitted to the court and are on record. However, your newspaper's reporter relied on one-sided statements for publication, which is obviously not an impartial attitude. It is hoped that you will make corrections. Sincerely, Lawyer Zai Liwu, July 19, 28th year.</p>
<p>To the Da Chang Chicken and Duck Store,</p>
<p>Having read the news item in your newspaper's news column on July 19, which reported that a staff member of the Chicken and Duck Store was arrested for selling opium, the content is quite inconsistent with the facts. Chen Xuesong, who has been arrested, was indeed an employee of our store, but before the Dragon Boat Festival this year, due to his violent temperament, his position was terminated. Therefore, regardless of whether the staff member's opium sales are true, they have nothing to do with our store. As for the claim that our store secretly sells opium in addition to selling chickens and ducks, it is truly shocking and unheard of. I don't know what the basis for such a claim is, but I suspect it is the speculation of a reporter. As it concerns the reputation of our store, we urgently request a correction. With best regards to the chief editor of the Shenbao, Da Chang Chicken and Duck Store, July 19, 28th year.</p>

<h3>Case of the Romantic Swindler Jiang Chuangjianqiu, Continued Hearing This Morning, Mao Jianqiu and Others Summoned</h3>
<p>Jiang Jianqiu, a romantic thief from Jiangxi, was arrested by the Public Concession Police and brought to the Special First Court for prosecution for defrauding women, defiling them, and stealing their belongings. After being sentenced to five years in prison, the French Police found that Jiang had committed similar crimes in the French Concession. Therefore, Detective Sui Wenzhi transferred Jiang from the Special First Court to the Special Second Court for interrogation and investigation. Jiang confessed to stealing jewelry from the concubine Zhou Jinxiang, Li Didi, the prostitute Xing Sannu, Liu Jindi, and the guides Chen Qunxia and Chen Lijun, and also implicated the actresses Mao Jianqiu, Yu Guifen, and Yao Yuchan, stating that they were also involved and had received gold jewelry, diamond rings, watches, and cash. The French Concession authorities legally prosecuted the case. Judge Qiu Huan concluded the case and awaited judgment. Subsequently, for the sake of prudence, a detailed investigation and cross-examination were required, so the conclusion of the debate was revoked, and it was scheduled to reopen this morning. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Now it is known that the Special Second Court has issued summonses, instructing the three actresses Mao, Yu, and Yao to appear in court on time for questioning. Since the occurrence of this case, it has aroused much discussion in society. Under today's trial, the truth will be revealed. It is expected that the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special Second Court today will be crowded with ladies attending the hearing. In order to maintain court order, the court will impose restrictions, and the general public may find their efforts to attend in vain. It is also learned that in addition to the Jiang case, the Eighth Criminal Court will also hold a hearing on the Wan Yuan Monk's sex scandal at the same time. It is also heard that Jiang Jianqiu's ingenious technique of using sex to commit theft was taught by his master, and there were two accomplices, Jiang being the last of the three.</p>

<h3>Four Kinds of Vitamins</h3>
<p>— Feng Zongying</p>
<p>Science in today's world is truly highly developed. Recently, vitamin E has been invented. It is said that it can be extracted from wheat germ and cottonseed. This vitamin E not only makes a good contribution to fertility for women, but can also promote development. Seeing vitamin E reminds me of the four kinds of vitamins A, B, C, and D that have been invented earlier. Therefore, I will re-describe them to inform the readers:</p>
<p>Vitamin A—Those who lack this vitamin can develop eye diseases. In severe cases, they may even go blind and their development may be hindered. The pathology is actually due to a lack of yellow and purple nutritional foods. Therefore, those who lack this vitamin A should drink more milk and butter, eat pork and egg yolks, and more importantly, eat more yellow pigment foods such as radishes, spinach, and various vegetables, with pig liver being the best.</p>
<p>Vitamin B—People on isolated islands have recently suffered from beriberi, which is characterized by swelling of the feet. There are three causes: (1) recovery from a new illness, (2) not walking on the ground, and (3) lack of nutrition, which in other words, is a lack of vitamin B. If this disease is not treated promptly, and the swelling reaches the chest and abdomen, it may endanger life. Therefore, one should eat more fresh meat, vegetables, and the leaves of green plants. Bran and red beans are even better, as bran contains the most vitamin B.</p>
<p>Vitamin C—Is most abundant in fresh foods such as fresh vegetables, fruits, milk, grape juice, and beans, especially fresh orange juice and tomato juice, which are full of vitamin C. If these foods are lacking, anemia may develop and there may be a life-threatening situation. Many have died from this disease, especially sailors, because they cannot obtain fresh food during long voyages, resulting in yellow skin, emaciation, and depression. However, nowadays, voyages are fast and ships are fully equipped with sanitary facilities, so fewer sailors and passengers suffer from this disease.</p>
<p>Vitamin D—Often, many children cannot walk freely even when they are five or even seven or eight years old. This is because their bones are not strong and they lack alkali and phosphorus, which is vitamin D, leading to a state of rickets. Those who suffer from this disease should eat more milk, cod liver oil, pig liver, and vegetable leaves to supplement vitamin D.</p>
<h3>Midday Nap</h3>
<p>— Lu Lishi</p>
<p>In summer, I think seven or eight out of ten people have such a habit: as soon as they put down their bowls after lunch, they start yawning frequently, and they soon find their sweet dreams on the bed. The hotter the weather, the more people "take a midday nap." What is the reason for this? And what is the relationship between this and our summer health? Let's talk about it:</p>
<p>This is a summer issue. In winter, fewer people "take a midday nap." In summer, the climate is so hot. In the city, people sleep late at night. Families with small rooms cannot rest until 11 or 12 o'clock, and they have to get up at 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning. Because of the lack of sleep, "taking a midday nap" seems to be the most hygienic way to do it in summer.</p>
<p>But can a person sleep right after eating? Of course, it is best to take a walk after filling one's stomach, or sit quietly for a moment. It is a bad habit to climb into bed immediately after eating. Many people can't resist pacing back and forth after a meal, and their addiction to "taking a midday nap" is already very deep. What is the reason for this? This is because the blood fills the stomach and becomes concentrated, causing the nervous system to become cohesive and causing drowsiness. So, he ignores the fear of stomach problems and goes to sleep. Everyone has this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Can "taking a midday nap" make you fat? Many people must be asking this. Here, I can say it won't. We can often see obese people who are smiling and sleepy. This is due to insufficient metabolism in their brains. The fatter a person is, the sleepier they are, and the sleepier they are, the fatter they become. It is definitely not the case that sleeping all day long will turn a skinny person into a fat person. Moreover, the reasons for obesity are nothing more than "eating a lot"—that is, eating a lot of snacks frequently—and the comfort of material enjoyment without thinking. In addition, the balance of endocrine glands in the human body can also make people obese. But if someone wants to get fat by "taking a midday nap," that is unreasonable.</p>
<p>Taking a "midday nap" in summer, weighing the pros and cons and the facts, is still more beneficial than harmful. A person's energy is limited. Sleeping less at night and resting slightly at noon is not a bad way to make up for it, as long as the time for "taking a midday nap" is limited, half an hour to an hour, no more than that.</p>
<h3>A Week's Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>In the summer, it seems that one should eat more fragrant things to feel healthy. Strangely, many people prefer to eat stinky things. The most prominent is stinky tofu. Every evening, the stalls selling stinky tofu are endless in the streets and alleys, and buyers flock to them. Two pieces of deep-fried stinky tofu, dipped in chili oil and chili sauce, and eaten with two bowls of tea-soaked rice, are infinitely delicious. Stinky tofu is not only popular among ordinary families, but also among gentlemen, ladies, young masters, mistresses, and fashionable ladies living in foreign-style houses. It is said that Mr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to France, also loves to eat stinky tofu, which shows that it is also a fine dish in the cookbook. My whole family loves this dish. At first, the older children absolutely refused to eat it, saying that it was harmful to health. Unexpectedly, recently they have been assimilated by their sisters, and they also want to try it when they see stinky tofu. We don't often eat the deep-fried stinky tofu from the stalls, but buy the raw ones and deep-fry them ourselves. In addition to cooking oil, soy sauce, sesame oil, edamame, and bamboo shoot tips, we also add some sugar, which makes it very delicious when eaten. In addition, after deep-frying, we braise it with fragrant mushrooms, wood ears, edamame tips, etc., which makes it even more flavorful.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw</h3>
<p>— Po Linshan Si</p>
<p>"Having two wheels, 'a cart shaft, and a cart box pulled by a person to walk," this is a very common means of transportation in our cities - rickshaw, a simple and accurate description. In Shanghai, we mostly call it "yellow package car," As for the "foreign car" in Beiping, the "cart boy" in Guangzhou, the "rubber tire car" in Tianjin, and the "Dongyang car" in the mainland, all refer to rickshaws.</p>
<p>Menard, a French businessman in Japan, brought us the first rickshaw from Japan in 1874. We should really be infinitely grateful to him. Because the first rickshaw was transported from Japan, and because its original word Jinriksha is completely a Japanese pronunciation, rickshaws have always been considered to be invented by the Japanese. In fact, it was an American sailor who lived in Japan for a short time, who, for the sake of his sick wife who needed to breathe fresh air, used his brain to invent a car similar to a rickshaw to carry his wife for a walk in the garden. Later, it was discovered by the Japanese, and after several modifications, it became the rickshaw of today.</p>
<p>"Those who are uneducated cannot set up fortune-telling stalls, and those who are unskilled cannot pull rickshaws." These two sentences are originally meant to mock those with low abilities; however, the contempt for rickshaw pullers can be seen from this. There is no harder job than pulling a rickshaw. On the surface, it seems that every rickshaw puller has a body made of steel, but in reality, they are "outwardly strong but inwardly weak." To be honest, two bowls of thin porridge are not enough for them to produce a body of stinking sweat. In addition, they often have their licenses taken away by the police, just like naughty students are often punished by strict teachers. And there are also things like men and women are not allowed to ride together, they are not allowed to carry sick people, and they are not allowed to carry heavy goods... As a result, their livelihoods are increasingly reduced; I believe that if the treatment of rickshaw pullers is not improved as much as possible, one day rickshaws will be eliminated.</p>
<h3>A Word on Dark Crystal Glasses</h3>
<p>— (Xu Lu)</p>
<p>Summer has already played its overture. Walking on the road, sitting in the car, all that can be seen is the dazzling light!</p>
<p>In this hot season, most people have a pair of sunglasses on their eyes, with very dark-colored lenses, decorated with charming and lovely colored frames.</p>
<p>Indeed, sunglasses have their own value. The heat of summer is already enough to make people irritable. While running around in the sun, adding to it the dazzling white heat of the sunlight, people become even more tired! However, if you wear sunglasses, it is true that the world in front of you seems to have completely changed. A refreshing coolness, a quiet coolness. Although the heat waves are ruthlessly invading from all directions, this is a physical endurance, but the heart is quite refreshed. At the same time, the degree of endurance also seems to have been reduced a lot. This is not difficult for experienced people to appreciate!</p>
<p>Finally, I want to give a piece of advice to the readers, which is that if you don't wear them, so be it, but if you do, we should pay attention to the lenses of the glasses themselves. Don't be greedy for cheap goods and unknowingly harm your own eyes, resulting in endless losses. It's not about how good they have to be, but they should not harm eyesight. Otherwise, harming one aspect for the sake of another is ultimately not worth it!</p>

<h3>Guangdong Women Going to America Detained</h3>
<p>A ship in Hong Kong, named Dongyang, was heading to San Francisco. The ship carried twenty beautiful women from Guangdong. On the day of arrival, they were all powdered and rouged, with emerald sleeves and red shirts, gracefully walking ashore together. The locals saw them and were greatly surprised, thinking, "What are these charming women doing in the city? Are they going to engage in prostitution?" They immediately reported it to the local officials. Upon hearing the report, the officials immediately signed an order to arrest them and put them in the police station to await interrogation. When the interrogation came, someone said to them, "This city now prohibits Chinese prostitutes. Anyone who comes here should be bound and executed in the marketplace according to the law. Soon, their beautiful faces will be reduced to red powder skeletons." The women were terrified and cried out in despair. The officials then announced to them, "There is no such thing. We just want to question you briefly. If you have indeed come to this city to prostitute yourselves, you will be sent back to your hometown on the original ship." The women were relieved, but they all did not want to go home and hired lawyers to plead their case, so they were released.</p>
<h3>Gezhi College</h3>
<p>The directors of Gezhi College in Shanghai gathered at the British Consulate yesterday. Those present were Mr. Tranlan Ya, Mr. Ni Lie, Mr. Xu Xiecun, Mr. Wang Jintang, and Consul Max. Consul Max said to the group, "I am grateful that the Mixed Court has allocated a fine of one hundred taels to the college, and the Governor-General of Liangjiang has donated one thousand taels. The donation of silver is a great cause for celebration!" Then, Mr. Tranlan Ya stated that he had promised to write to England, requesting various manufacturers to donate Gezhi equipment. He has now received a reply from a large manufacturer, which he presented to the group. The equipment and models that will be sent will arrive in China soon. The directors all expressed their gratitude and asked Mr. Tran to convey their thanks. Mr. Tranlan Ya then announced to the group again, "When we first planned this initiative, we did not dare to hope for much. But judging by the current situation, the prospects for this initiative are great. Therefore, we should expand its scale so that it can revitalize Gezhi and benefit China." The meeting lasted for three hours before it adjourned.</p>

<h3>Briefly Discussing Young Celebrities</h3>
<p>— Shangqing</p>
<p>The so-called young celebrities, of course, refer to people who are still young, under forty years old. But because of their young age, although they can all be called celebrities, their demeanor is somewhat different from the old and established ones. At least, they write in vernacular Chinese, so young celebrities can also be called new celebrities.</p>
<p>My views on the status and value of young celebrities are the same as my views on old celebrities, and I will not discuss them. Since everyone considers them celebrities, and they themselves think they are celebrities, I will call them celebrities and say what I want to say.</p>
<p>They generally have some of the habits of old celebrities that people dislike. However, they are not superstitious, they do not have retrogressive ideas, and their future is far above that of old celebrities. They are hopeful. But they also have their fatal flaws, which are enough to corrupt them and contribute nothing to the country and society.</p>
<p>They think of themselves as artists, and artists should have the demeanor of artists, so they show a romantic (Romance) air everywhere. Although they oppose the old celebrities' drinking, smoking opium, and keeping concubines in their words, they inevitably frequent tea houses and dance halls in their actions and pursue "free love." To be honest, they are even worse than the old celebrities in some respects. For example, most of them do not keep their promises, do not take responsibility, and when given something to do, they either procrastinate or simply mess it up. In their opinion, they are romantic artists who disdain to be constrained by this. They are emotionalists who are unwilling to compromise their feelings to do what they should do rationally. They live a muddled life every day, not knowing what they are doing, let alone what they will do in the future. ...</p>
<p>I say this about them without the slightest intention of looking down on them. If they truly have such an undeniable belief in life, I will not criticize them, because everyone has the freedom to choose their own way of life. But I wonder if they have ever thought about this: did we call them to this world to consume themselves in this way? Have they ever thought about this: in a broad sense, they are part of the whole human group, and in a narrow sense, they are part of the human group they contact around them (such as relatives and friends), and they have an absolutely inseparable relationship with all human groups, and their slow suicide will have an adverse impact on the future of all human groups? Are they really at ease? Are they going to be so lost and unrepentant?</p>
<p>I say this without the slightest intention of looking down on artists or anyone who is oriented toward emotion. On the contrary, I have the utmost respect for such people. But I believe that true artists or emotionalists have Shakyamuni, Jesus, and the great religious leaders, Confucius, Plato, and the great thinkers, and even Alexander, Napoleon, and the great military strategists, and certainly not those who simply procrastinate or mess things up. Because true art or emotion is definitely not selfish, lazy, or passive, but rather popular, hardworking, and accomplished. Even if we take Goethe, Byron, and even Wilde, their status at the time and their reputation in later generations were not gained through the romance of art, but through the art of romance; in other words, they have indeed gained something in art, and they do want to express it, so it comes from the path of romance, and they are definitely not going to gain something on the path of romance and to express their art; to put it more clearly: their greatness is definitely not because they can play with women or mess things up, but because of their insights and achievements in art; playing with women and messing things up are just some embellishments that cannot be avoided in life, that is, in art. Otherwise, there are many people who can play with women and mess things up, so why are they not all artists? I ask them to ask themselves: How are they? Aren't they reversing the cause and effect? Aren't they abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the superficial?</p>
<p>In ordinary times, an artist should not only focus on romance. Now, when everyone is working hard to resist and build, they especially should not do this. They have more opportunities than the old celebrities. Don't they want to make some real and true expressions in their hobbies, life, and art? As for what kind of expression is considered real and true, they, like the old celebrities, know it very well and do not need my words.</p>
<h3>Qi Jiguang’s Manuscript by the Spear</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>I recently acquired a copy of Qi Jiguang’s “Zhi Zhi Tang Ji,” of which “Manuscript by the Spear” is Qi’s collection of poems. The meaning of the title is likely an admiration for the elegance of composing poetry by the spear, although Cao Cao and Qi Jiguang were absolute opposites. The fact that Qi could write poetry amidst the chaos of military life and a deluge of military dispatches truly demonstrates the refinement of a Confucian general. Comparing it to today, such as Feng Yuxiang’s vernacular poems, and Zhang Xianghua and Luo Zhuoying’s quatrains, are they not also poet generals?</p>
<p>Qi Jiguang, a famous general of the Ming Dynasty during the Jiajing and Wanli reigns, had two major accomplishments in his life. One was quelling the bandits in Zhejiang and Fujian during the Jiajing era, and the other was defending the border at Ji Gate in the early Longqing reign. In Zhejiang and Fujian, he moved with the swiftness of a storm sweeping away leaves, so he had fewer opportunities to write poetry. However, at Ji Gate, he was more leisurely, focused solely on defense, so he produced more poetry at this time, even creating a long poem of over a thousand words, “Account of Ji Gate.” His poetry, like his parallel prose, is not very clear and feels somewhat obscure, but not overly so.</p>
<p>He dedicated his whole being to his country. Such declarations are frequently seen in his poems. In a letter he wrote, "Sending a letter to a confidant, not understanding the sound of writing. A man’s heart is like iron and stone, always devoted to serving the emperor." He wrote on horseback: "Three hundred and sixty days a year, mostly spent wielding a spear on horseback." At the Platform of Gazing at the Imperial Palace, he wrote: "Ten years of driving and rushing, the sea's color is cold, a lonely official here gazes at the imperial palace. The heavy frost is all the blood of my heart, sprinkled on the thousand peaks, turning the autumn leaves red." In the Xin Hai year (i.e., the thirtieth year of Jiajing), feeling moved while guarding the border, he wrote: "Every time I endure frost and dew, my eyes are always bright to serve the country." At the Loyal Oath Tower, he wrote: "Striking the oars, the ambition of former worthies, cutting the hem, the grace of national scholars." Feeling moved at Guanling Temple, he wrote: "A solitary official's temples are streaked with rain." At Puning Temple, Qi wrote: "Though a hundred battles can loosen my belt, in my life, I console myself with my loyalty." Rain obstructing travel at the shipyard, he wrote: "Driving and rushing is our lot, not regretting graying hair.</p>
<p>His most famous poem, still recited today, is likely the Victory Song: "Ten thousand hearts as one, Mount Tai can be shaken; only loyalty and righteousness, their spirit soars to the heavens. The commander cherishes us like parents; violating military law, the body is not free. Orders are clear, rewards and punishments are credible, rushing into water and fire, who dares delay? Reporting to the Emperor above, saving the common people below, kill all the barbarians and seek a title of nobility." This song is very good, but the last line seems to have a selfish element, but it is only a way to persuade the masses, with a slight enticement. His own concept is not like that. In “Deep within Military Strategies” he said, "Becoming a noble is not my intention, I only wish the waves of the sea to be calm," which is an excellent answer; he only knows the country, not himself.</p>
<p>The "Chronological Table of Famous People's Birth and Death Years" will not record Qi Jiguang's birth and death. According to the first line of Qi's poem on New Year's Eve of Bingzi, "Fifty springs are separated from the dawn," Bingzi (the fourth year of Wanli) was when he was fifty years old, so his birth year should have been the sixth year of Jiajing (1527). His year of death can be found in the Ming History. He led troops north in the second year of Longqing. "Sixteen years in the Garrison. Half a year after Juzheng's death, the ruler suddenly changed him to Guangdong. Jiguang was depressed and could not achieve his ambitions, forcing himself to go once, and after a year, he retired due to illness. After three years, his salary was confiscated, and Jiguang died." From going north to his death, he spent sixteen years in the garrison, one year as a minor official in Guangdong, and three years at home, which is about twenty years. So, calculating twenty years from the second year of Longqing, his year of death was probably around the seventh year of Wanli (1579). The Bingzi poem should have been written in his office in Guangdong. He did many meritorious deeds for the country, but in the end, he only got impeached and had his salary confiscated, dying in depression. However, even if he encountered adversity, his loyal heart was still for the country. There are such lines in the Bingzi poem: "Do not talk about the past with you, my loyal heart still beats even as white hairs grow sparse." Such a national hero, who always sacrificed his small self for the country, and was both civil and military, is so admirable.</p>

<h3>Red Devil Vasika</h3>
<p>— by Maxim Gorky, translated by Di Zhou</p>
<p>"Then... is it good to leave here, to start a new life?"</p>
<p>"Where to go?" asked Aksiunia.</p>
<p>"Anywhere is fine,... I can definitely ask the carousel owner for compensation... According to the law, he cannot refuse to give it. Besides, I still have six hundred rubles on me."</p>
<p>"How much?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Six hundred rubles."</p>
<p>"Ah, you have that much!" she said, yawning.</p>
<p>"Yes,... this money can be used to open a store... and... if I get the money from the carousel owner,... then, let's go to New Bilisk. Or to Samara... let's open a store there,... open one of the best establishments in the town,... take in a group of the prettiest girls,... set the admission fee at five rubles."</p>
<p>"You're bluffing," Aksiunia laughed.</p>
<p>"What do you think about that? It will definitely go smoothly..."</p>
<p>"How..."</p>
<p>"Do as I say... if you like, we can get married."</p>

<p>"Get married!" Vasika repeated, looking a bit uneasy.</p>
<p>"You and me?"</p>
<p>"That's right..."</p>
<p>Aksiunia burst out laughing. Her body swayed in the chair, the chair creaking, she wanted to laugh heartily, but instead made an unnatural, grating sound.</p>
<p>"What's wrong with you?" Vasika asked, the look of insatiable greed reappearing in his eyes, but she was still laughing.</p>
<p>"What's so funny?" he asked her.</p>

<h3>Casual Talk by the Fence (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yu Tang</p>
<p>I love chrysanthemums, but I love to see those humble wild chrysanthemums that only embellish a sparse fence, not the famous and exotic varieties that have been praised and commented on. Because the former possesses natural charm, while the latter has artificiality. Regarding Ju Peng's opera, I appreciate his singing and acting that are rich in ancient charm, the so-called scholarly air, and reject his recent affected and pretentious pronunciation and singing style. In the winter of the twenty-first year, Ju Peng and Xiao Lou E Yun came to Shanghai, and I went to "see" them every day. Although I had acquaintances in the audience and could sit in the fifth or sixth row, I still couldn't hear clearly what he was singing on stage. Sometimes, it was like watching a silent movie. Ju Peng's pianist would tell me that even he couldn't hear what Yan Laoban was singing on stage, and he could only watch his lip movements and gestures, trying to figure out the tune. It's no wonder, as the Tianchan Theater is really too big. Not long after Ju Peng returned to Beijing, I also went to Beijing, hoping to hear his opera in that small courtyard in Beijing, but he didn't perform there. Later, he accepted an invitation to Hankou, where he stayed for a long time. Normally, I went to his residence every day to hear him practice his voice. He sang while strictly training his pianist, making him follow his tune seamlessly. From that time on, I discovered that Ju Peng had begun to create his so-called "Yan style." He first placed each word on a proper note, paying particular attention to the handling of falling tones and rising tones. Then, he tried his best to use his ingenuity to emphasize every tune, whether long or short, or subtly adding, subtracting, and altering it. He transformed the tunes of painted faces and Qingyi roles, taking them for his own use. Sometimes, I even suspected that he was adopting the tunes of the big drum narrative. This result of painstakingly pushing and seeking perfection made his singing completely move towards the two paths of "delicacy" and "skill." As soon as he opened his mouth, it was "delicate," as soon as he opened his mouth, it was "skillful," covering up all the good qualities of various notes that an old male role should have. Fortunately, Ju Peng still has a deep cultivation. If it were someone else, after such a transformation, it would be a "poverty" beyond description. If the former Ju Peng was like an ancient Chai kiln vase, then the current Ju Peng is like an intricately carved ivory ball. If calligraphy were used as a metaphor, then the former Ju Peng's opera was like Wang Xizhi's Orchid Pavilion Preface, but now he is indeed using the popular "artistic style" to show off to the world. This transformation may be because Ju Peng knew that it was difficult to please the audience with the ancient tunes alone, so for business reasons, he had to open up a new path out of helplessness. Perhaps his belief in the models of his predecessors had wavered, so he made a clever decision, created a new sound, and established a new school. Both explanations have considerable reasons.</p>
<p>After eight years of separation, this time, I expect that he must have brought a bellyful of "new tunes" to give Shanghai people a new experience, because Ju Peng may know better than us that it is impossible to perform opera in Shanghai without "gimmicks."</p>
<h3>Grand Charity Performance</h3>
<p>— Zi Yan</p>
<p>Spectacular from July 24th to 30th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Amateur Theater Actors' Charity Performance, after more than two months of preparation, has recently decided to be held at the Golden Theater from the 24th of this month. The theater groups participating in this performance include "Gonghua," "Mutual Aid," "Jiaoyi Society," "Nightingale," "Baolian," "Jingwu," "Hualian," "Fudan," "Yinqian," "Yiyou," etc., a total of ten groups. In addition, there are five theater groups, including "Shanghai Theater Arts Society," "China Girls' High School," "Snow Society," "Lewen," and "Professional Women," that support participation in ticket sales and backstage affairs. It can be called a "grand lineup." Such a joint performance by many well-known social theater groups, whether in terms of repertoire or number of performances, is unprecedented in the history of Chinese drama. Even the Spring Joint Performance of Shanghai theater groups in the spring of 1937 was not so grand. Moreover, this performance is for "charity," which has more social significance than a purely joint performance.</p>
<p>The dates of this performance will last for a week (from the 24th to the 30th), with a total of nine performances, including seven multi-act plays and three one-act plays.</p>
<p>Because it is a charity performance, the tickets are divided into four types: five yuan, two yuan, one yuan, and five jiao. There is also a joint ticket, which allows you to watch every show, with the one-yuan joint ticket selling for only five yuan, and the two-yuan one selling for only ten yuan.</p>
<p>The performance programs and events have been decided, and are now listed below:</p>
<p>July 24th, 8:00 PM, Nightingale Theater Society will perform "Permanent Friends," written by Kang Min and directed by Yu Qie, which also includes a song, composed by Chen Gezhang.</p>
<p>July 25th, 8:00 PM, Hualian Theater Group will perform "Living Drunk, Dying Dreaming," which is the original work of British S. Maugham, directed by Xu Qu.</p>
<p>July 26th, 8:00 PM, Yinlian Theater Group will perform "Postponing Debt Repayment," which is the original work of British Dale, adapted by Chen Mian, and directed by Xia Xia.</p>
<p>July 27th, 5:15 PM, Mutual Aid Theater Group will perform "Flowers Weeping Tears," which tells the story of dancing girl life. The actresses in this performance are all popular dancing girls from various dance halls, which can be said to be a real-life performance. The script was written by Yu Ling and directed by Lan Lan, who played "Mimi" in the previous performance of this play.</p>
<p>July 28th, 8:00 PM, Baolian Theater Group will perform "Before Sunrise," which is adapted from "Swarm of Orioles Flying." The playwright is Shen You, who wrote "Female Ballad Singer" for the Spring and Autumn section of this newspaper, and the director is Lu Si.</p>
<p>July 29th, 2:00 PM, Fudan Theater Society will perform "Love of Life and Death," which is also the original work of British Maugham, translated by Fang Yu, and directed by Wu Renzhi, who is also the director of "At the Beginning of Man."</p>
<p>July 29th, 8:00 PM, Shanghai Amateur Theater Jiaoyi Society will perform three one-act plays, including Wu Tian's creation "Go," Yalunaer's "Old Villa," and Chekhov's "Accomplishing Good Deeds" (this year is the 35th anniversary of his death). These three plays have not been performed in Shanghai, and probably have not been performed in other parts of China.</p>
<p>July 30th, 2:00 PM and 8:00 PM, two performances will be jointly presented by "Gonghua," "Yiyou," and "Jingwu" three theater groups, "The True Story of Ah Q." The script of this "The True Story of Ah Q" was directed by Tian Han, which is different from Xu Xingzhi's version being performed by the Sino-French Theater Society. According to insider critiques, Tian Han's version is the best in terms of writing skills among all his scripts, and it has been performed many times in the inland, but this is the first time in Shanghai. The director is Zhang Jie.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Theater Arts Society originally planned to participate in this charity performance, but because it was busy preparing for a four-month long-term performance, it could not participate in fact. However, it is said that it will perform a special performance during the long-term performance in the future, and the income will be allocated to participate in the performance.</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The popularity of Yan Ju Peng reminds me of the downfall of Guan Dayuan</p>
<p>This time, Ju Peng was invited to the Golden Theater, and it was full every day. Even on evenings with strong winds and heavy rain, the attendance did not decrease slightly, which not only broke the record, but also exceeded any expectations. In fact, to be fair, not only has the strange tune not been cancelled, but it is probably even worse than before. Because I mistakenly heard from a friend that his voice had recovered, I went to see the joint performance of Yan, Hou, and Ma, "Entering the Palace," braving the summer heat. As a result, I felt very disappointed. That day, my seat was a bit far, but no matter what, I should not have been unable to hear a word clearly, only hearing a strange tune at the end of each section. After he split with Yan Heng, he acted independently, trying his best to imitate Wang Xiaonong and Cheng Yanqiu. All his contractions and releases, sudden widenings and thinnings, and especially slow places are not found in any Tan school male roles. In conclusion, the delicacy and slowness are imitations of the Dan tunes, and the sudden contraction and release of the endings are taken from the Zai Tiao tunes. A good Tan school male role foundation has been transformed into today's Yan school strange tune. No wonder the people of Beijing call him "French Old Man." This time, he came south to perform at the Golden Theater in the French Concession, and the business was booming. I jokingly said to him, "It's no wonder the French Old Man is so popular in the French Concession."</p>
<p>The news that Uncle Yan was mistakenly reported to have come to the South a month ago caused a sensation in Shanghai, and the extraordinary wealth gained at the Golden Theater this time shows that the psychology of Shanghai's music lovers yearning to hear good operas is indeed too universal and the need is too active. Originally, "things will reverse when they reach the extreme." In the past ten years, the Dan roles have been too prosperous, and the male roles have been too declining. Although Gao Qingkui is said to be too miscellaneous, he still has a good voice and can give the audience a happy listening experience. Unfortunately, he has recently collapsed again. Wang Youchen is not good at relying on, but his voice is sweet and there are really a few Tan flavors. However, he died when he had not visited Shanghai for a long time. (63)</p>
<h3>The Affairs of Female Performers</h3>
<p>— (Hai Sheng)</p>
<p>After Wang Xichun appeared on the screen, she often went to the Grand Light, Cathay, and Nanjing theaters to watch movies when she didn't have day shows or filming, as a way to observe expressions and acting skills. According to the director of the Wen Su Chen film, her performance is not bad.</p>
<p>You Linghong is planning to leave the place where she's based after the "Common Dance Mansion" summer program, and is in negotiations.</p>
<p>There is a very strong atmosphere of Jin Biyu returning to the stage. "Common Dance Mansion" is inviting her to appear. She has been away from the stage for a long time, and her appearance this time will definitely cause a sensation.</p>
<p>Chen Yujun found a house in Bao Lian Li. She goes to the Golden Theater at eight o'clock every morning to practice with her teacher, Sun Yaofang. Recently, her delicate body has been unwell, and she eats very little, only some porridge.</p>
<p>Fen Mudan (also known as Qi Meiqiu) has had a toothache for the past few days and goes to the doctor for treatment every other day.</p>
<p>After Yu Xiuxia got sick, her roles were taken over by Chuan Juying. She has returned to the stage since the night before last.</p>
<p>Li Xuefang's English reading is already capable of simple conversations, and she can write very beautifully, which is indeed the result of her devoted study.</p>
<p>Ma Jinfeng and Biyu Lian read the Fuxing Mandarin textbook every afternoon. The teacher is Li Zheng.</p>
<p>Since her partner Guan Wanyou ran away for the second time, Xue Youqin often said generously: "This idea, people's hearts are even more unpredictable."</p>
<p>The Han Suqiu and Su Lan sisters went to the Grand Theater the night before last to watch the thirty-six episodes of Journey to the West.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Film News</h3>
<p>— Yin Jian</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang decided to go to Shanghai on the Russian Empress ship on the 21st because she received repeated telegrams from the Shanghai China United Film Company urging her to come. Li Dashen will travel with Chen.</p>
<p>After Li Zhuozhuo separated from Zhang Yi, she found a new partner, a young man surnamed Chen. This person is neither as burly as Zhang Yi, nor does he have a suave and unrestrained demeanor. Moreover, he is unkempt and his clothes are ordinary. If Zhang Yi is a lion, then this person is like a docile sheep. Li Zhuozhuo's love for him is probably for this reason.</p>
<p>Li Li from Beijing sometimes claims to go abroad, and sometimes claims to organize a film company, after all, I don't know which is true or false. It is rumored here that Li Li and Zhang Yi have the love of living together; Zhang Yi lost to Li Zhuozhuo and won to Li Li, also does not matter.</p>
<p>Lin Chuchu is in Hong Kong, filming "Daughter's Fragrance" for the Sanyou Company. Little star Li Keng is at his side, watching his mother act.</p>
