<p>社評</p>
<h3>西班牙戰爭與歐洲危局</h3>
<p>自義德法西斯與西班牙國民軍合力攻陷巴薩隆納以後，西班牙抗戰已踏入了更嚴重更艱苦的階段。但西班牙戰事郤並未如墨索里尼輩所期望一樣的「可即吿結束」，不僅並未結束。西班牙政府軍且仍將堅决抗戰到底，已佈成新防綫，跟法西斯侵略軍隊長期相持，使侵略者永遠無法征服西班牙。這樣的說法，有下列三點的根據：</p>
<p>第一，西班牙政府軍仍擁有精銳的主力，而並未因巴薩隆納的失陷而削弱。西班牙政府軍的放棄巴薩隆納，顯然是一種「戰略的撤退」，是並未經過决戰就退出的，因此，西班牙政府至今仍擁有五十萬精銳主力軍。</p>
<p>第二，西班牙政府仍擁有全國三分之一以上的廣大土地，可作爲繼續抗戰的根據。巴薩隆納的失陷，並不會給它以致命的打擊。巴斯克自治政府主席亞基爾說得不錯：「我們根據了三十個月的經騐，知道戰爭的勝負，未可以一城一市的得失爲轉移，我們是爲了各項基本原則而戰，今後仍當繼續抗戰，直至獲得最後勝利爲止！」</p>
<p>第三，西班牙抗戰不僅是它本身的問題、同時也是歐洲乃至世界和平所繫的問題。因此，它有着全世界愛護正義人士的支持。在今天，「援助西班牙」的呼聲已響徹世界的每一個角落。這種全世界人民大衆同情的洪流，必有匯爲巨大援助力量的一天。</p>
<p>從上面的叙述，可見得西班牙抗戰，雖因巴薩隆納的失陷而日臻困難，但却仍具備着取得最後勝利的條件。自然，自另一方面，巴薩隆納的失陷對於歐洲局勢必將發生嚴重的影響，這種影響現在顯已從事實上表現出來：</p>
<p>首先，巴薩隆納的陷落，不僅打擊了西班牙政府，同時也威脅了法國，威脅了英國在地中海的霸權。巴薩隆納在比利牛斯山的南面，密邇法蘭西邊境，對於法國安全的威脅，不消說是很大的。而且，此後義大利必得利用它在西班牙的地位，加緊對法國的壓迫，這在法國是已經痛切地感到了。</p>
<p>其次，巴薩隆納的陷落，必更將助長柏林－羅馬軸心的氣燄，希特勒已决定新的擴展計畫，即將發表演說，據美聯社所傳，他將不僅要求歸還殖民地，並且還將索還二十萬萬鎊的賠欵，當本稿付排時，希特勒的演詞還未收到，但倫敦和巴黎是正迫切地期待着他的演說呢。</p>
<p>總而言之，法西斯在西班牙的勢力愈進展，歐洲的形勢愈危急。目前歐洲的局勢，是正繞着西班牙戰事變化着。我們不必吾認，今天西班牙已臨到了緊急的關頭。但英法當局能夠幡然改圖，放棄不合法的「不干涉」政策，給予西班牙以積極的援助，挽救危局還並不太遲！</p>
<p>可是讀了法外長龐萊和英首相張伯倫的演說，知道這兩個國家至今仍沒有放棄「不干涉」政策的意思。張伯倫並且還表示將一貫的繼續其縱容侵略的綏靖政策，這結果是只有促進戰禍的。</p>
<p>最近，墨索里尼看到西班牙戰爭前途的渺茫，又提議召集新的慕尼黑會議，來解决西班牙問題。慕尼黑會議曾經一舉而犧牲捷克，替納粹打開了東進的道路；現在義大利法西斯看得眼紅，也想來一個新的「慕尼黑」，以滅亡西班牙，打擊法蘭西，不列顚，以至世界民治勢力的集合點。一貫努力「綏靖」的張伯倫，是否又會來導演這一套呢？</p>
<p>新的慕尼黑會議有吾召集的可能，這郤要問西班牙自己。西班牙跟捷克不同，西班牙是在堅决抗戰中，它的回答必將是抗戰，抗戰，抗戰到最後的一人！</p>
<p>全世界的人民已認識西班牙人民的鬥爭，是和平與進步反抗法西斯的鬥爭，歐洲的前途將從比里牛斯山麓下的决鬥結果來决定，全世界愛護和平的人士，必須起來突破「不干涉」的束縛，粉碎縱容侵略的「綏靖」政策予西班牙政府以積極的援助！之心、倡救人救世之議、更於此偉大著作中、對於日本必加緊侵略中國、世界各國必陷於不能自解之困境、反覆說明、雖言之於二十年前、而與現在所暴露之事實、無不一一吻合、我全國國民、人人遵奉總理之遺敎、應人人共信此救國救世之典章，今美總統特舉九國公約號召世界、維護公約、以圖恢復東亞之和平、而國聯會員諸國、亦皆知美總統之主張、爲世界共同幸福前導、惟暴日之瘋狂正烈、各國之行動未彰、欲竟抑止暴日之全功、須更加肯定公約之眞義、査九國公約之重大原則有二、一爲尊重中國主權領土及行政之完整、二爲門戶之開放與機會之均等、詳察公約之精神、熟觀目前之事實、則知非闡揚第一原則之大義、確保其實際之效力、則第二原則必無從實現、證以我總理二十年前建議於全世界之開發中國實業計劃、更足確信吾國民、不獨贊助門戶開放之原則、亦且願以公平互助之原則、與世界各國作互助和平之合作、總理發展中國實業計劃、結論中最警切之語、一曰「日本於每一戰爭之結局、輙獲最厚之報酬、無怪日本軍閥以戰爭爲最有利之事業、今中國旣已醒覺、日本即欲實行其侵略政策、中國人亦必出而拒絕之、即不幸中國爲日本所佔領、不論何時何處、斷非日本所能統治有利、）二曰、（列强之行動、如眞實協力、爲共同之利益計、則彼軍國主義、欲爲物質向中國戰爭者、自無所施共伎倆、）三曰、（爲萬國互助而謀共同開發中國經濟者、自能實現、爲個人或一民族之私利者、自當消滅於無形、）吾人遵奉總理遣敎、熟察國際趨向、抗戰必勝、建國必成之信念、旣已確乎不可移易、當此神聖之犧牲已發揮無上光明之今日、尤望全國軍民益振其奮鬥之精神、勇猛前進、以爭取抗戰之勝利、而樹立建設中華民國之根基、以與世界友邦在互助和平之原則下、作眞誠之合作者、完成建設中華民國之偉業、必如是而後不負吾同胞千百萬人之壯烈犧牲、且使吾全國國民與其子孫以及世界無窮之人類、共受我軍民以生命所造成所保障之和平幸福於無窮、彼日本軍閥狂悖之思想、狡毒之企圖、殘酷之行爲、今日所施於吾國者、還將結成彼所自受更爲悲慘之果、九一八以後、彼國中所不斷發生之悖逆事件、已暴露其端倪、七七事變以後、殘暴行動所造成之惡果、恐較共用以殘殺吿同胞之武器暴力爲尤多也、明乎以上所述、可知堅决抗戰、爲國民革命一貫之使命、亦爲吾人救國救世唯一之眞誠、暴敵狂悖狡毒之行爲、不僅徒勞、充共所極、必自陷於不拔之深阱、全體會議認爲後期抗戰最終勝敗之决定其因素已早種之於前、而吾全國軍民自開戰以至於今、其英勇忠誠一德一心之精神、世界友邦主持正義維護公約之行動、更已確立吾國必勝之基礎、惟其如此、自今以後、吾人之責任、益加艱鉅、欲擊破暴敵最後掙扎之猛烈侵略、更須竭盡吾全國國民所有之心力物力、共同致力於加强團結、積極奮鬥、與努力建設三事、而提高民族精神、以整飭革命紀律、更爲上述三事成功之保障、謹揭要義如左、（一）所謂加强團結者、本會議認爲團結必本於眞誠、而革命精神必求其純一、臨時全國代表大會鄭重申言、期望全國有志之士、集中本黨共同奮鬥、本屆會議茲再懇切致望、國家艱危至此、必盡量增加抗戰建國之實力、以收衆志成城之效、全國同胞、不問其過去政治見解與派別之如何、凡願實行三民主義而參加本黨從事國民革命抗戰建國之神聖事業者、無不誠摯歡迎、惟國民革命之目的、在求得國家之獨立、與民族之生存、故必保持中國民族眞誠純一之精神、而後國家之基礎、始能永固、本會議鄭重聲明、吾人絕不願見領導革命之本黨發生二重黨籍之事實、更不忍中國實行三民主義完成革命建國一貫之志業、因信仰不篤與意志不堅致生頓挫、世界各國、當革命建國之始、無不由於舉國一致上下一心、乃能排除艱難、以底成功、中外古今、絕無二道、自今以後、吾同胞必當精神團結、竭智盡忠、信行三民主義、爲後期抗戰盡最善之努力、爲建國偉業立不拔之基礎、（二）所謂積極奮鬥者、吾同胞當知（行百里者半九十、）最後行程、常最艱苦、吾人檢討過去一切工作、實猶未盡努力、所努力者未盡確實、未盡恊調、亦未能言行一致、始終一貫、貢獻其全力、以適應戰時之要求、今之後期抗戰、實爲吾國與日本軍閥最後成敗之决賽、舉凡前方後方、尤其在被佔領區域、或鄰近戰區之軍民、一切思想行動、苟不能嚴加反省、嚴加檢舉、嚴加改正、以其能力自由生命完全貢獻於國家、增加反攻之力量、則無數先烈犧牲奮鬥之成績、固功虧一簣、而我民族亦將不免於覆亡、故我同志同胞、自今以往、必須共矢忠誠、在最高統帥領導之下、絕無保留、絕無猶豫、勇往邁進、由此生死存亡之大戰中、爭取國家獨立民族生存之成功、（三）關於加緊建設者、吾人須知建國之主力、在於建軍、非具堅如金石之國軍、則民生無所保障、民權無從維持、民族無由生存、而心理建設·政治建設·與經濟建設、實爲建軍之基礎、所謂心理建設者、必當根據總理知難行易之學說、發揮總理軍人精神敎育之主旨、普及國民軍訓、增進敎育效能、推廣戰時服務、使全國同胞、無一不爲三民主義之革命戰士、以不成功即成仁之精神、求得最後之勝利、所謂政治建設者、要在嚴明賞罰、綜覈名實、集中力量、增進效率、加强民衆組織、統一民衆行動、解除人民痛苦、改善人民生活、而在後期抗戰開始生機存亡所繫之關頭、尤宜組成中央黨政軍統一指揮之機構、使令國黨政工作、得與軍事相切合、以收共同行動之效、故特設置國防最高委員會、以統一黨政軍之指揮、關於經濟建設、不僅爲抗戰勝負所繫、亦爲建國成敗所關、必當依於戰時人民生活之需要、分別輕重、斟酌緩急、實行統制經濟調節物質之生產消費、舉凡抗戰必需之重工業礦業、民生日用必需之輕工業、運輪需要之鐵道航空綫公路等、必竭力之所能努力興舉、更以鞏固幣制、流暢金融、促公私產業之發展、他如農林畜牧之改進、全地蘊藏之開發、至於各省生產能力之增加、尤當合政府人民一切資本技術之力、切實加緊推行、此種經濟建設、固爲充實抗戰之實力、亦爲實行民生主義之基礎、至於在抗戰期中、世界各友邦政府人民、或以物力財力相恊助、或爲精神道義之聲援、或救濟傷病饑寒之軍民、或助我興復被敵摧毀之學校、凡此高義、皆所永銘、深信吾國此次抗戰之結果、必能恢復我國家主權領土及行政之完整、必能重振國聯盟約九國公約非戰公約之權威、豈獨門戶開放機會均等之原則得以實行、我總理二十年前建議於世界以國際和平互助之結合共同開發中國實業之你大計劃、亦於是得以實現、以我原料之富市塲之廣、戰後建設需要之切、對於消納外資與技術合作、觀察各工業國現有之能力、亦絕不虞其過量、而我全國國民今日多出一分之力、戰後必多獲十百倍之利、蓋凡眞正之經濟利益、於世界人類絕無所私也、上述三事、爲我全國所應積極努力之目標、而根本要義、尤在提高民族精神、整飭革命紀律、以實現革命建國之三民主義、總理昔日講述軍人精神敎育、痛切說明、「人類有精神之用非專恃物質之體」、「欲任非常之事業、必有賴非常之精神」、特舉智仁勇爲革命救國者必須具備之道德、唯「合於道義」之智、始爲革命所需要之智、唯能「臨事不避一往無前有不奪不饜之决死精」、始爲革命所需要之勇、亦唯「捨生救世、捨生救國、不問利害、竭盡責任」、始爲革命事業所賴以成就之仁、無求生以害仁、有殺生以成仁、始於大智、終於大勇、始能建設國家、完成革命、以保我民族萬世無疆之滋命、我全國同胞、常此生死關頭、惟有以成仁取義之决心、實行三民主義之大道、人人誓死、奮勇效忠、以吾人數十年必死之生命、立國家億萬年永生之根基、則抗戰不患其不勝、建國不患其不成、共在本黨同志與一切任國家軍政之人員尤當人人懍乎自身職責、與革命紀律之嚴重、以身作則、爲民前錄、必須確立森嚴之紀律、樹信賞必罰之正義、而後乃能集衆志爲一心、合衆力爲一體、不因一隅之失、危及國家、一人之誤、禍及公衆、須知抗戰設敵、生死爭於須臾、而建國大業、乃爲永久不磨之工作、若不繼以嚴明之紀律、豈能收成功之實效故革命紀律之嚴格執行、即爲抗戰精神之澈底振作、此實抗戰建國勝利成功之最大保障、必須盡全力以實行者也、本黨本於革命建國之歷史的使命、當國家民族危急存亡之秋、領導全民、毅然負荷、責任愈重、使命愈艱、凡我同志、務以至誠、遵守决議、一心一德、接受總裁提高黨德鞏固黨基之指示、振作精神、集中意志、堅定信仰、充實能力、深入戰地、深入淪陷區域、深入下　鄉村、刻苦堅忍、以身作則、臨難必先先赴之、以此精神、竭盡職責、亦以此精神、感孚中外、至我全國同胞、聞義或有後先、行義絕無二致、此次抗戰之能堅持不移百折不撓者、實爲我全國同胞人人奮發不惜犧牲一切以從事救國建國大業之偉績、今抗戰已入後期、大功只餘一簍、得道多助、世界之同情、已集於吾國、有志竟成、興復之大功、必歸於吾民、行見抗戰勝利之日、即建國吿成之會、願我全黨同志全國同胞、共喻斯意、悉力赴之、（三十日電）</p>

<h3>金融　現金價絕鮮變幻　盤旋於二零二零元之間</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况甚鮮變幻、終日在上週六之晚收價左右盤旋、然全天差度亦僅有二元之微、良因大衆均期待張伯倫與希特勒發表之演說、故而暫懐觀望態度、咸不願輕於進出、雖中途北帮稍有吐售、然銀樓帮則拋塞不殷、故在錢兌業暨證券帮購買力下、因之為狀呆平、陸績跌一元、交易於是亦稍减少、僅有六百餘兩、各方人心較上週末稍佳、銀　飾金暨海關金及中英純金等均無變動、</p>
<p>烚赤僅軋小一元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開喊價為二千零三十三元、但未見做開、延至九時三刻、首見某錢兌業代同業進現金號五十兩、及北帮五十兩、二千零二十元為開盤價、繼之銀樓帮進錢兌業五十兩、價　相同、其間突聞外滙受港電與沙遜拋塞後、稍趨鬆硬、故價亦頓見下挫、某錢兌業進銀樓帮及現金號各五十兩、價均十八元、其時證券帮暨銀樓帮忽來吸購、故即回升、證券帮相同價亦吸購金號及北帮各五十兩、銀樓帮進同業五十兩、價二十元、錢兌業互做五十兩、價十九元五角、最後金號售予錢兌業五十兩、價十九元為午收價、午後仍鮮變幻、交易亦寥落、直至二時四十分、始見錢兌業互做五十兩、價十九元、繼之又見金號進錢兌業五十兩、價十九元五角、此後因聞外滙受洋行扒後逐漸回乎、故而買者稍殷、三時三刻又見錢兌業互做三十兩、價二十元、其時仍有人喊二十元買進、然售者均無意供給、致未做開、晚收價為二千零二十元、較上日軋跌一元、現余號之本牌金售出價二千零三十元、收進二千零十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>節金兌價未更動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出均無更動、大同行老慶雲等仍懸原價二百零五元、新同行懸二百零三元、收進一百九十七元、</p>
<p>關純金亦無動靜</p>
<p>中央銀行之中國現金收買價未更、仍為一千二百十四元、掛牌海關金亦未更動、仍計二元三角九分九厘、上海標準標金慣亦隨之未更、仍屬一千二百零九元三角、乃廿八日倫敦電、英純金每盎斯仍呆定於七鎊八先令八便士半所致云、</p>
<h3>外滙轉賣頗湧　廣幇與錢兌業亦起拋售港匯</h3>
<p>滙市昨以洋行雖扒、但因銀行較有供給、且港電及沙遜與紗花帮等咸起吐出、致潛勢稍硬、唯中途仍少變化、成交殊淸、港匯亦稍鬆動、乃錢兌業與廣帮力塞之故、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠均見回長、紐約銀價仍無更動、倫敦生金亦無上落、匯兌英對美大一厘二、對法小四生丁、對滬平平、美對英長三七五、對法升一二五、對滬降二分、中央掛牌各匯呆定如故、銀行早開現貨賣價英匯八辦士三四三七五、美匯十六元二五、較上週六午收均平、開後洋行雖扒英金八辦士三四三七五、及美滙十六元二八一二五、唯因銀行供意尙殷、故狀况缺乏變化、滙豐掛牌揭曉如舊、白銀平衡稅揭曉升一分半、此後港電及英商沙遜等咸起售出英金八辦士三五九三七五、及美金十六元二八一二五、大多由華比荷蘭美行等收進、加之錢兌業亦跟踪拋出港匯五十六元一二五、且外銀行買胃艱難、致過程漸轉鬆動、午收銀行賣價、較晨開略鬆、英金八辦士三五九三七五、美金十六元二八一二五、</p>
<p>後市紗花帮傾　美匯為十六元三一二五、而洋行則扒英金八辦士三四三七五、外商各銀行亦買賣兼營、故狀態仍鮮變動、入後雖廣帮售出　滙五十五元八七五、但以荷蘭美行等爭收不已、致潛勢稍緊、延至晚收、銀行賣價、英滙八辦士三五九三七五、美匯十六元二八一二五、與午收相同、結果比上週六英　硬〇一五六二五、美賤〇三一二五、港滙亦長二五、茲將一天做開交易錄後、英滙（國幣一元計算）美滙（國幣百元計算）港匯（國幣百元計算）</p>
<h3>貼現止漲</h3>

<h3>外幣趨勢穩定</h3>
<p>上週六英純金未動、英美滙兌升一二五、昨日外滙市况、供求尙平、趨勢穩定、烚赤交易尙旺、市價變動狹小、勢呈盤旋、外幣英美金鎊及金票、稍有交易、市價升降微有參差、多數未更動、公會交易稀少、僅長泰出恒茂進英金票五十鎊、昨日市價、英金鎊降五分、英金票升二分、美金鎊升一角、美金票降二釐、香港票降一釐、義金票降五釐、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>
<h3>證劵　公債行市　驟難回復　北方賣出影響</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、經過兩日停市後、交易比較熱鬧、趨勢仍在高壓力下抬頭不起、賣方之現貨流出、依然源源而來、除十號之繼續賣出外、又有同康號及大豐號等偏於賣出、市上因此謠言又起、雖屬空穴來風、向壁虛構、但在此極度虛弱之人心、已不堪再來襲擊、或謂此後利息方面、行將另有新改革、或謂此後之抽籤其籤支數目方面、或將减少、種種不經之談、按此後第七次抽籤、五種統一公債、均將依照原定辦法增加籤支、尤以甲種為最優、謠言之來、即本於此、其實華北方面執有此項公債者、確有其困難之處、法幣不能暢通、且有抑價之意外不幸、故現貨之到申而賣出者為數不少、加之連日十號賣出仍未中止、是以數度上漲、終遭壓迫而下降、今日起市價當除息三元算、且有發行新公債五萬萬之擬議、前途恐暫時仍不易挽回萎靡之人心也、昨日經過、上午初開、散戶似有進胃、市價緩緩趨堅、中途十號三十一號以及同康號　氣驟湧、市價乃直綫下降、收盤時樂茂及長泰號買進、乃稍回好、但已跌七八角至一元餘、午後交易較稀、趨勢仍係先好後小、初則協大買進市氣甚堅、繼以洽豐號及恒德號以及聯和號紛紛賣出、再走下游、比之上午再小數角、結果一致續跌計小九角至一元七角不等、成交總數共計約七十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票行市、近日因收買者較多、交易較旺、久無人問訊之江南造紙公司股票面二十元、成交五六百股、價為二元三角半、閘北水電股成交五十股、價為六元五角云、</p>
<p>烟煤塊屑、高貨仍見求過於供、各工廠因陰曆歲暮、儲藏較貪、市面暗中已呈堅象、價乃冉冉上升、昨日某號開出澳洲煤數百噸、計篩塊每噸四十二元、統煤四十元、屑子四十一元、棧房出貨、行扛另加、但存貨已不多、即將吿罄云、</p>

<h3>黃金世界</h3>
<p>自世界整軍，積極備戰以來，黃金即為各國官民一致爭藏之對象·黃金雖不能充饑禦寒，貨幣學家又公認為終有一日貶黜其貨幣上之地位·但在目前資本制度世界下，究尙未消失所關「內金萬能」之資格，故國家政府窖藏以備維持其外滙，淸算其輸入軍火之貨價·人民則唯恐戰時紙幣跌値，故紛紛窖藏，以備其財富之保持。故近年各國貨幣用金之保有量，雖已激增，但尙不及世界之金產量增大之速。如近年世界產金量，每年平均皆可增加一千一百公噸；則自一九三三至三八年止，當已增加六千六百公噸之多。然世界各國保有之貨幣用金，在同上時期內所增者不過四千公噸而已，可知最近六年間，民間之藏金量，又增大二千六百公噸之多。</p>
<p>據最近一期之FedcralReserve　Bulletin雜誌所載：一九三三年末，世界貨幣用金總値共一三，八二六百萬舊美元；其後年年激增；至去年九月末已增達二一，三六七百元舊美元。然日本則已自二一二百萬舊美元，激减至九七百萬舊美元（此數尙依日方官報統計，實際現已入於無準備時代矣）；而中國則反自五百萬舊美元，激增至九百萬舊美元（此數當未包括其他存金在內）。允可注意者：日本之貨幣金準備，在一九三六年末為二七三百萬舊美元，三七年末减為一五四百萬，三八年九月又激减為九七百萬舊美元，換言之：去年首九個月內，即激减五千七百萬舊美元，况去秋八一三戰事發生以來，日本已一再輸出國内存金，甚至重估準備金價以予輸出之便，今且將最後之準備金亦公開作部份之外輸，然在同上時期，中國政府保有金，反自五百萬舊美元增至九百萬舊美元，至昨年九月末會維持不動。相形之下，日本實力之弱，顯而易見。况據最近各方估計，我國國內存銀額，即在目前為止，尙有九億至十億圓之多。此尙不在上數之內。茲將該誌估計數。列表如次（單位百萬舊美元X係槪算數）</p>

<p>外棉市價、美現棉市塲、異常狹小、然現棉交易尙屬良好、大部多頭、紛紛掉換遠期、唯一部份空戶、因政府對棉業立法及貸款棉之出售等問題、尙未發表、故大衆均暫抱觀望態度也、昨日美棉漲二磅音、印度連同預測漲半羅比、埃及漲十四餘磅音、昨日滙兌較為堅定、折合法幣、棉價俱漲、計美棉及巴西棉每担二角、印棉漲一角餘、埃及棉漲五角、</p>
<p>本市外棉交易、昨日因紗價較跌、交易較為淸淡、印棉銷數最盛、咸因近日粗紗暢銷故也、申新對於外棉交易、幾每日必有、昨日又進印棉二百包、統益亦進印棉五百包、茲將昨日成交件額及價格分録於後、</p>

<h3>糧食　小麥產價高昂粉銷平淡如前</h3>
<p>粉昨為週初開市之期、現粉市塲交易平常、緣客銷續减、南北帮雖有染指、均屬零星、且華北大戶去化已靜、而廠方以目下生產不多、售意堅挺、結果以原盤成交各牌粉二萬包以上、除本街零批約有八千包外、其餘冀魯帮為多、汕閩帮次之、二號粉廠盤車船牌一律四元八角、綠英雄四元四角半、叉聞洋粉市價現貨每包五元、而定貨約四元六七角、暫無成交、</p>
<p>今日出口麵粉有五千包運天津、四千五百包運烟台、叉麩皮一千包、粉四千包運汕頭、</p>
<p>麥前昨小麥來源、尙不寂寞、到貨約有八九千包、内由新港來三百五十包、新到之貨、仍以產價高昂、貨主堅執、而廠胃亦不甚歡迎、蓋目下各廠目定洋麥以來、對於國麥品質之揀選、更為注意、故市面醞釀多日、始稍回漲、統市售開江北蕪湖滁州浦鎭麥四種、併計七千包、由福新阜豐兩廠各半辦去、市價比上週已見漲數分、最高為六元五角五分云、</p>
<h3>厚粳到貨較多　五千包轉運天津</h3>
<p>昨日國米來源、到六號、車輪包子近八千包、其中以厚粳居多、故在此本街及囤戶去路呆滯之際、遂更難以立足、惟售方心思互異、有願售者、有仍不願售者、是以市面混沌、結果常錫帮貨跌去一角有奇、而蘇同帮心思較堅、祇疲數分、惟薄稻更以來源不夥、貨價認已跌透、均囑扳守、市面勉定、杜洋尖埠尖及變元亦貶一角及角外不等、昨有米五千四百包由港來轉津、</p>
<h3>中次客秈　暴落一二角</h3>
<p>昨客秈到頭絡繹不絕、新交易雖已大部停止續辦、然尙有大量存貨待運、且有一部份客販因該地存款關係、仍擬守小搬運、浮散各販尤多在市貶價求脫、故中次蕪秈跌小至九元半左右、比之前市較小一二角不等、惟高貨尙圖堅擯、故昨市僅小五六分云、</p>
<h3>黃豆高貨奇缺　市價邁步前進　餅豆運往汕港</h3>
<p>黃豆市况續見向上推進、刻下市塲中祇崇明豆、常川有到、但亦日見减少、尤以高品奇缺、故中下貨行情愈見堅昂、昨崇明沙黃最低價、已開至七元四角一分、最高價仍開七元五角半、價雖未動、然在品質言之、則須相差四五分耳、平湖杜豆比較上週足提角外、成交二百餘包、價為九元及九元二角、由本街及小呂宋帮辦去、蕪湖豆做開三百包、價為七元五角、該豆最合本街去路、崇明沙黃由本街厦門興化等三帮、採去七百餘句、</p>
<p>豆子今日運汕頭九百三十包、運香港一百五十包、</p>
<p>又今日有大豆餅二千片及小豆餅二千一百十片運往汕頭、</p>
<p>生仁則有三百八十包運汕頭、一百包運香港、</p>
<p>豆油昨有四千件自大連來、又生油一千一百件自青島來、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷粗白頻跌不已</h3>
<p>昨荷粗白繼續下降、公會劃盤現貨二四荷粗白外棧為二十四元一角、本棧二十四元三角、大余錢嘜二十四元五角、均跌二角、轉口貨降度愈甚、竟跌進十六元大關以十五元九角成交、較最高價降度已近一元、比前日又小四角、其勢似尙難立穩、太古車白仍持原價、但交易寥寥、國糖新貨來源仍缺、査前日雲南輪入口僅到白糖三十五包、並據泉州電訊、地價又升三元、而運貨亦祇四百餘包、號盤開出亦少、汕赤普通貨成交數十包、價為十四元六角、又昨由汕頭來糖一千一百包、</p>
<h3>南北貨　紅芡價廉引起囤積</h3>
<p>普通紅芡因現非銷令、最低價曾到二十四五元、査最高價須四十餘元、降度已達三分之一、可謂低廉已極、頗為人注目、漸有購入囤積者、價乃稍見回振、開至二十七元、昨市高貨須開三十元、然照地價合劃、以輸運困難、外費加昂尙難合算、</p>
<h3>新建菇來源不繼</h3>
<p>福建香菇自新貨登塲以來、因產區猶未盛出、致到貨　斷、乃各帮需要正殷、査本市底存極薄、故行家手貨已一致扳緊、聞近日港帮在辦、如新菇行盤索二百二十五元至二百二十元、陳菇亦復帶高為一百九十元、且均需現鈔、諒即日可望成交、</p>
<h3>進出口　來往貨色頗旺</h3>
<p>厦門又有大批蜜橘、計一千五百餘件、汕頭橘子亦有三百八十件、及窰貨二千五百件、昨日進口、今日有煤油四千箱往汕頭、</p>
<p>自意大利來洋紙四百噸、顏料四十桶、叉有鋼精二百噸轉往大阪、寗波來烟葉一百四十件、香港來茶末五百五十件、香港來轉烟台肥田粉四千包、</p>
<h3>五金　靑鉛鐵銷路突起</h3>
<p>靑鉛鐵近因會司鐵行情昂貴、故用戶方面多改銷之、市塲情形連日忙碌非凡、天津帮熱水瓶廠香烟公司製罐廠等需要頻繁、雖在廢曆歲暮、然成交仍達五六百箱之鉅、行情以供不敷求、步步上升、每箱價售至四十三元五角、比上日又漲五角、雙連行情則要四十五元、亦比前硬起一元光景、調査滬存有限、且新貨尙無裝來、執貨者心思高昂、不肯輕易脫手、所以後市情形諒無回鬆之望、據海外定價、最近要六金元、（每箱二百磅）亦比前好起半元光景、且乏近期路貨、預料後市行情、殊無趨跌之慮也、</p>

<h3>利用世人弱點之醫藥廣吿</h3>
<p>— 汪企張</p>
<p>本刋期，宋恪大概三氏有「民衆對於誇大醫藥廣吿應有之認識」一篇傑作，大有陳琳一檄，足愈阿瞞頭風氣槪；寂寂孤島，不能無空谷足音之感也。以是知天地間正氣，未全消歟！予日閱中外報常六七種，恒覺海上著名各報，於醫藥廣吿，輒占宏篇巨幅，殊不能不引人一瀏覽。然試一考之，醫界廣吿之最占篇幅者，為花柳病，而藥界廣吿之最占篇幅者，為滋補藥。知醫藥生意眼之已臻上乘矣。何以故？曰花柳秘病也，患者多諱莫如深，每不願就素識之醫，而洩其秘，故所謂醫者，卽利共弱點，而詳陳種種症狀，使病者對照其隱患，而吞餌焉，則其計售矣。此花柳病廣吿之所以大，所以多，所以不厭求詳也歟！滋補藥，似藥而非藥者也，無立見效騐之可能，有長期服用之必要，藥之有效與吾，無證也；體之需要與否，不問也。總而言之，統而言之，藥具萬能，人皆可服，久而久之，似有意想不到之效力在。且想及滋補者經濟類多裕如，於是食補之外，繼以藥補，一經嘗試，何妨久服，有錢者大都作如是想。此滋補藥廣吿之所以大，所以多，所以包羅萬象也歟！嗚呼！醫藥廣吿政策之揭破，宋汪之傎，宋汪之願也。</p>

<h3>傷寒雜談之一（續）</h3>
<p>— 張克成</p>
<p>是否傷寒</p>
<p>傷寒這個病，自古已有·所以古醫籍裏面早已載着這個病名，可是不幸之至，據張子鶴醫師著中國醫藥科學討論一書詳細解剖之下，原來傷寒論一書所講的根本不是傷寒，而是流行性感冒，把舊醫的憑藉一筆勾銷；那麽還是待我們內行來談談傷寒吧。</p>
<p>發熱是一種症狀，有好多病都要發熱，傷寒也是發熱病之一，故傷寒也有發然這個症狀，同時因為發熱是一種顯而易見的症狀，很容易為病家所注意，而傷寒這病的可怕又深入人心，故病家逢到發熱，就懐疑到這個病，但是，上面說過，發熱並不限於傷寒，要靠發熱這一點來判定是否傷寒，未免冒味之至，雖然現在大家量學着體溫，可是旣不塡熱型表，又天天用發汗藥，更其弄得糊裏糊塗，漆黑一團。</p>
<p>從新醫學識輸入以後，大家又知道傷寒的脈搏不隨體溫之比例上昇，似乎又多一種把握，但是，傷寒的脈搏徐緩僅見於成人，至於小兒，靑年而神經質的婦女以及有動脈硬化症的老人，其脈搏多不見徐緩，這一點又靠不住了。</p>
<p>Diazo陽性反應也是傷寒早期診斷之一種方法，可是在輕症的傷寒，就很多顯示陰性，並且顯示Diazo陽性反應的疾病也不祗傷寒一種，即使懂得這個方法，也仍舊是茫然。</p>
<p>白血球减少症也是傷寒的一種重要症狀，但是傳染病中見這症狀的也不少，尤其小兒的淋巴球本來比成人多，和成人比較起來，不見得怎樣减少。</p>
<p>血淸反應（Wiedal氏）可說是判定傷寒的重要法門了，但是第一，此種陽性反應須在發病第二週以後，尤以第三週達最高度，不過醫家不能等到這陽性反應出現了以後方下藥，所以雖然是好方法，却是不能應急，第二，此種陽性反應也見於其他疾病，尤其是粟粒結核，如果張冠李戴，那害處可不像那不對頭寸的輕鬆。</p>
<p>細菌的檢出。這是最可靠而又早期可以得到的好方法，因為傷寒的病原菌在早期已出現於血液中，經過時間愈多，則其檢出率愈高，故如欲早期判定其是否傷寒，這方法是再好沒有的了。</p>
<p>至於要靠舌苔，神智，食慾，面貌來判別，不特時間上不許可，並且也實在沒有大價値，從這樣看來，要診斷傷寒，怕不是易事吧！</p>
<p>治療常識</p>
<h3>治療性神經衰弱的最大注意</h3>
<p>— 汪于岡</p>
<p>性神經衰弱在現時代的嚴重性，是可以從就診病類的此例，函詢病類的比例，和藥品廣吿的比例來推斷他到如何猖獗，這不光是一個醫事問題，使得醫界中人發生憂懼，感到將來他的病型愈嬗愈惡，對於國家民族前途的危害非常之大，便是敎育界中人也感悟到他是學生的當前大患，想把這狂瀾抵當，因此漸漸有提倡性敎育的動態。我頻年接到來問這種病情和療法的信太多了，為避免一一作答麻煩計，便發行了一册性神經衰弱自療法。</p>
<p>把他的本態分為二大類，一種是過敏狀態，也就是興奮狀態，一種是遲鈍狀態，也就是麻痺狀態，二者的區別並不是始終劃然不變的，大抵後者為前者的承繼人，所以是時間問題，也就是程度問題，但是這二種症狀的區別是非常明顯的，前者如易於衝動，易於興奮，早泄遺精等等，後者如缺乏快感，常覺疲勞，勃起力减弱或陰萎等等，對於這種種不同的症狀，治療法當然要不同，倘隨意投藥，誤認效能，正如抱薪救火，不但無益，反增疾苦，這是我平時有感而說的，其中錯誤最多最大的，是濫用兩性生殖腺內分泌製劑，據這種病人主訴，是早泄。</p>
<p>失眠，易於衝動等等的過敏性型，問其以前療法，則稱經某某注射「賜保命」若干針，不特無效，勢更加劇，照此病狀，用此療法，豈不是負薪救火？這種診例，不一而足，實在是目前「內分泌治療時代」的誘惑，把「賜保命」當作性神經衰弱萬能藥和「九一四」一般的濫用，不過「九一四」用不得其當，尙無後患，「賜保命」用不得其當，那就有不安穩的結果發生了。</p>
<p>藥物知識</p>
<h3>科學化之中藥</h3>
<p>— 周夢白</p>
<p>中藥雖有寒熱溫凉升降浮沉之說，這都是為着附和陰陽五行等玄理而來，然其有治療疾病之效力，確不能湮沒，如半夏鎭吐，麻黃發汗，杏仁治咳，大黃下瀉等，都是實在成績。如何能鎭吐發汗治咳下瀉，則皆所不知，此是知其然而不知其所以然也。現在要知其所以然，則不得不用一番科學的整理及研究功夫，如用植物學去認識他的類屬，用生藥學去鑑定他的組織，用化學去分析他的性質，用藥物學去試騐他的生理作用及功效，作成有統系的報吿，俾醫家去臨症施用，如此非獨舊有功效，可以證實，新的效力，亦常有發見。然這番整理及研究工夫，非有充足的經費，和素有研究的新醫藥人才，經過相當的長時間不可：並非粗製濫造種種不知所云的溫和藥，附和一點尙在研究討論中的醫藥新學識，用演譯童話樣的廣吿術，卽可吿於衆曰：此某病之特效藥也，此經科學方法改良之新藥也。有如近時市塲上，非醫藥家所出之藥品，自欺欺人，誠為科學界之蟊賊，醫藥界之害馬也。現為製藥者有所遵循計，為用藥者有所標凖計，將中藥曾經人研究者，其性狀已經明悉，其效用已經證實，均由學理而成事實，且有收載在藥典中者，節輯於此，藉可增添一般國民之衛生常識；想亦是提倡中藥科學化之一法也。惟說來或有失檢之處，還幸醫藥同志：能進而敎之耳。（未完）</p>

<h3>傳染病家消毒之簡法（上）</h3>
<p>— 朱仰高</p>
<p>去歲以來，時疫不斷流行，加之孤島人衆，傳染更甚，為預防萬一起見，不得不注意病家之消毒，消毒一事，原屬常識，惟欲施諸實行，方法方面，亦不得不加以考究，方能見功，不然，則非徒託空談，即是草率，對於事實，一無所補。</p>
<p>病家消毒，可分為二部，　臨床消毒，　結束消毒，二者幷行，方期有效。</p>
<p>（一）臨床消毒</p>
<p>臨床消毒，卽隨時消毒之調，不論病者之排泄物日用品以及其他之物件，如與病者受有接觸機會者，槪作染着病菌論，故須隨時施行消毒，阻止病菌之傳佈。</p>
<p>（甲）痰液，鼻涕，鼻沫，口唾，口沫，漱口水，嘔出液，大小便，血液，膿液，瘍瘡腐物，以及皮膚痂蓋及其脫下皮屑等之消毒，其能用紙張包揩者，可即隨手焚燒之，不然則先盛入含有消毒劑之器皿，使其有至少二小時之接觸，同時須注意被消毒物之全部受得消毒劑之浸着與蓋沒，茲將二種便宜而易得之消毒劑，介紹於下，　石灰乳，其製法即以鮮石灰粉一份，徐徐加入淸水量二份，調匀即成，例如一公斗鮮石灰粉加入之水量為三公斗，　百份之三之石炭酸液，由藥房購得之濃石炭酸，惟冬時往往凝凍，可將藥瓶盛入水溶解之，取出三西西，加入一百西西之水量即成。</p>
<p>（乙）茶飯具（杯碗，筷，匙等），洗具（面盆，漱口杯，牙刷，手巾，浴盆，脚盆等），書報，玩具，衣服及床服，窗簾，桌衣等之消毒法，亦甚簡單，碗杯衣服等之可能煮沸者，槪煮沸之，（沸後尙須煮十五分鐘），其不能入水之物件，則除書籍玩具，可行燃燒法外，即用百分之一之福美林液浸入二小時，（福美林濃液藥房中都有且不貴），毛件，皮革，橡皮製物件，亦可用此液噴濕後，用毛刷刷之，再入日光曬乾，病室地板掃聚之雜物，俱可用燃燒之，檯，桌，凳，椅等木器之消毒，都可用百分之三之石灰酸稀釋液沫揩之。</p>
<p>（丙）每間病室中，須備盛有白分之三之石炭酸液面盆，作臨時洗手及其他消毒之用，家屬或他人曾經與病者接觸過者，須將碰着之體部加以消毒，其後再用熱水及肥皂洗濯五分鐘。</p>

<h3>三外輪被挾持駛靑　永貞業經釋放　昨晨離靑駛滬海達哈發未釋英挪兩國領事决再繼續交涉　—開琳駛阜昨被迫原船折回—</h3>
<p>行駛上海阜寗間之海達·永貞·哈發。三外輪、於二十七日晨在洋河口、被日艦挾持、强迫駛赴靑島後、英挪兩國領事、昨均向日方嚴重交涉、永貞輪經英海軍當局交涉後、已獲釋放、於昨晨八時半、離靑來滬、英開琳瑪勒日前駛阜、因遭日艦攔阻、即於昨晨折回、外僑對此、極度憤慨、茲經現代社記者探誌各情如下、</p>
<p>英挪領事電請交涉</p>
<p>日前被日方强迫駛赴靑島之三外輪、永貞係屬英商、海達·哈發、係屬挪威商、自該項事件發生後、即經各該航商分別報請英·挪·兩國駐滬領事、請為嚴重交涉、要求尅日釋放、當經兩國領事於昨晨分電該國駐靑領事就近向日方交涉、昨日下午、據領署接得靑島來電報吿、調該案經向日方抗議後、竟諉稱係靑島海關當局之事、故交涉尙未得要領、聞英挪領署方面、决繼續提出强硬抗議、</p>
<p>永貞先釋離靑駛滬</p>
<p>另據現代社記者昨向永利輪船公司方面探悉、永貞輪自被扣後、除由英領向日方交涉外、並電駐靑英海軍當局、逕向日海軍負責人嚴重交涉、要求尅日發還、旋接據確實報吿、永貞輪業由日方允予釋放、於昨晨八時駛離靑島、逕回上海、將於今日抵埠、至海達哈發兩輪、昨日傍晚、亦有釋放消息、但尙無法證實</p>
<p>開琳駛阜被迫折回</p>
<p>英商開琳馬勒輪向亦行駛阜寗綫、自海達等被扣事件發生後、該輪為確保安全計、故於廿八日由滬開航時、曾請由英總領事轉知英海軍派英艦一艘隨輪保護、迨駛抵洋河口後、英艦始轉赴靑島、但該輪旋即被駐泊該口之日艦四艘攔阻、無法駛入合興鎭靠埠卸貨、延至昨晨十時、迫不得已、仍由洋河口原船折回、逕返上海、今日即將抵埠、依照目前情形、該港口已為日艦非法封鎖、各外輪能否開航、須待交涉後、再行决定、</p>
<p>日方舉動外僑憤慨</p>
<p>本市英美各國外僑對於日方拒絕開放長江、阻止外輪通航、曾經一再交涉、迄無結果、顯係日方有意排擠外僑在華權益、故羣情原極憤慨、自海達等被扣、及開琳被阻卸貨後、外僑方面、以日方行動、更趨横蠻、故為確保權益起見、决再呈請本國政府作進一步有效之措置、</p>

<h3>「裝筍頭」</h3>
<p>— 賡</p>
<p>『裝筍頭』是某一社會的術語，它的含義便是『誣陷』。</p>
<p>東方的木匠，到現在還沿用着古老的技術。譬如大木匠的起造房屋，小木匠的構製用具，都不大願意利用鐵製的螺絲釘，而寗可費去較多的時間，將木頭鋸鑿成凹凸形，以便構製建築。這凸形的便呌做『筍頭』。所以房屋的起造，用具的構製，裝筍頭的工作，是極重要的。換句話說！房屋或用具筍頭不裝起來，是不能成功的。</p>
<p>某一社會的老朋友，為要達到他們敲詐的目的，或攫取對方的持有物，除實施恫嚇外，還得動腦筋，轉念頭，想出歪理十八條，因為單純的恫嚇，是會招致一般社會的痛罵的。於是無中生有，假詞侵凌；有些「哀黨」，更不惜「開天門」，自毀顏容，以逞其陰謀。這種作風，這種手段，在某一社會中便呌做『裝筍頭』</p>
<p>我們曾經說過∶上海人是挺聰明的，不僅吸收力高强，傳佈力也很敏捷。這句術語上海人不僅懂得，也會使用。不過究竟天資欠高明，雖然懂得『裝筍頭』的含義，會得使用『裝筍頭』這一句話，可是要實施『裝筍頭』則還嫌手段拙劣，容易給人家看出破綻。却沒有我們的東鄰「友邦」來得成熟和練達了。</p>
<p>據本報香港二十四日電：據天律來人談：津最近法租界所發生的劉大同，王竹林，金碧東，川島芳子等暗殺案，均係日方自為。蓋日方意欲藉以要挾租界當局，諉為包庇抗日份子。要求檢査或封鎖英法租界。這便是日方施行『裝筍頭』最近的實例。</p>
<p>至於說東鄰『友邦』對中國的外交，則是一貫的採取『裝筍頭』政策的。如君不信，請翻閱中日外交史，記述着的儘是些『裝筍頭』和被『裝筍頭』的故事。也可以說日本對中國的外交史，祇不過是一部『裝筍頭』的成功史。</p>
<p>是的，東鄰『友邦』『裝筍頭』已獲得成功了，但他們却忘記『裝筍頭』的失敗，在遇到對方的『不領盆』『不賣賬』。中國的奮起抗戰，便是『不領盆』『不賣賬』的具體表現。英法美等民主國家在法西巨魔想假題目『裝筍頭』的時候，應該如中國以抗戰來對付這種誣陷的卑污行為的方法，來粉碎法西巨魔『裝筍頭』的陰謀。</p>
<h3>學費急於債</h3>
<p>— 晏然</p>
<p>為了不能實行日本議員的辦法，把唯一的「生殖腺」割去，於是，自家便生出了二個「討債鬼」，旣然生了小孩子，一到入學年齡，又不能不送到學校裏讀書。於是，每學期的一筆學費，眞够使拿腦汁來維持生活的父親大人的我，感到大大的困難和拮据了。</p>
<p>案頭上的日曆，一張張的翻過，啊喲！二月一日的開學日期，一刹那，又快到來了！這幾天，一個九歲孩子，拿了學校裏的那張「四聯單」，交給了我，呌我馬上把學費送到銀行裏去。我拿來一看，眞不得了，一個剛在初小二年級的小學生，所要繳納的費用，是學費十六元，課業用品費二元，雜費一元五角，建築費一元五角，共計大洋二十一元正。我不禁倒抽了一口冷氣，再把那張「四聯單」看下去，在注意欄內，又淸楚的印着：「如開學前未繳學費，扣發入學證：開學後，遲繳一天，罰洋一元，如一星期後尙未繳費者，取消學籍。」唉！學校當局的面孔，扳得鐵靑，一些也不肯通融，一文錢也不能缺少，眞是使做家長的人，一點也沒有辦法。想不到這年頭在「謀生難」之外，更加上了「子女讀書難。」從前人說：「人情大如債」，現在却變成了「學費急於債」，怎不令人感慨系之呢？</p>
<p>不過，話得說回來了。生了子女，書自然是不能不讀的；要入學校讀書，那末，學費自然也不能不付。可是，我却十二分誠懇的請求辦學的校長先生們，收了學生們的學費，却要盡些責任，激發天良，不要以為　錢到袋袋，便算「心滿意足」；要給繳費者以相當的代價才好。否則，未免太對不起一般辛辛苦苦，東拚西凑，繳納兒童學費的家長們了。</p>
<h3>觀「美專畫展」後：</h3>
<p>— 亦頻</p>
<p>前幾决已經在大新公司及寗波同鄕會，舉行過書畫展覽會，參觀者絡繹不斷，然而「古董」貨的書畫佔十之有九，而對於新的畫是「油畫」「水彩」「鉛畫」在一般年紀稍大的人，見了就要戚然歎曰：「此謂畫乎！」。</p>
<p>現在美專以嶄新的姿勢出現在大新公司四樓，倘使你有暇去參觀一下，一定使你很覺得滿意的。</p>
<p>當我興忽忽的在入口處把名簽過，跨進去出現在我的面前是，六大幅的油畫「難民流亡圖」，我逐一的看似乎在腦海裏已經浮上一幕一幕殘酷的流民圖。</p>
<p>這一幅，不是在打起包袱豫備逃難嗎？他們將要離開親愛的家鄕，相依活命的田園的。</p>
<p>又一幅，你看，坐在道旁兩手掩住臉，在那裹抽泣的難婦，前面仆倒在地上的一個死屍，這不是她的兒子嗎？</p>
<p>住在上海的人們，祗曉得收容所裹的難民，其實他們以前所遭遇的處境，在這裏可以一切完全吿訴你。</p>
<p>「光明將臨到」這副畫得好極了，在曠塲的一角一男一女男的指着前面，好似說：「光明將要來了！」不過指着的那個地方顏色有些黯然，太不適宜（這是我個人的意見）作者如何，無從推知。</p>
<p>有一幅「難民」水彩畫，最難堪的，就是那老嫗一雙小脚，見之令人作憤。從前外國人終以小脚來侮辱我們，現在竟是我們自己的作品，在可能的範圍最好改良一下。</p>
<p>這次的「美專」畫展是相當的成功。</p>

<p>遠東的法西斯魔王眞會玩把戲，像不久，他唆使在精衛斡旋和平運動，破壊我們的抗戰旣定國策，但在民族情緒萬分高漲的當兒，艷電成了一顆潮濕的爆竹，汪精衛同時也成為一個光桿的叛徒，第一套把戲失敗了，近衛倒閣，接着來一套小玩意，希望張伯倫首相從聘問德意之後，也來聘問一下東方的三弟日本，但總沒有西方兩位老哥的面子大，張首相終於不賞這個臉，又失敗了，接着來了第三套把戲，請吳佩孚出任開封的綏靖委員會的委員長。想藉此打通南北傀儡的合串。</p>
<p>吳佩孚是出名的硬漢，他過去雖然是一個老軍閥，但常自比關岳，尤其是在他軍事失敗之後，以不托庇外人相標榜，近來以屠殺中國人成名的劊子手土肥原中將一再引誘，吳佩孚一向是嚴詞拒絕，並且以棺材來立誓，旁人看來都覺得土肥原之技窮矣了！</p>
<p>但吳佩孚終於是無價之實的古董似的，「江西人」終於不肯放鬆他，一個越硬，一個誘得越厲害，現在竟以先造成事實計，用開封綏靖委員會的委員長名義，想藉以造成旣成事實，事前先行張揚，在侵略者的心目中，或許可以弄假成眞吧！</p>
<p>但是吳佩孚一生事迹，並沒有怎麽稱道之處，只有他的骨氣是確比那汪精衛之類要自愛一點吧！况且吳佩孚也是一個光桿子，以汪精衛的前車之鑒，犧牲了淸白的晚節！給民族的敵人去强姦他的關岳信仰，並且換來的傀儡宦途也並不遠大，吳佩孚自問如果他不是傻子，不是一時的神經錯亂，决不會糊塗到如此地步的。</p>
<h3>駒影歌聲</h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>派拉蒙公司出品　大光明戲院開映</p>
<p>「駒影歌聲」（Sing　yousinners）又是一張以唱歌跑馬為題材的影片，不過這和一般的以唱歌跑馬為題材的影片又似乎微有不同，不同之處，是在於作者很側重於人情的描寫，因而和那些單以喜弄跑馬歌唱者，便覺得入眼得多，固然，有幾塲歌唱塲面的挿入，還是嫌其突然，但這巳較合乎情理得多了。</p>
<p>因而，與其看那些莫名其妙的歌舞片，我是寗願看像「駒影歌聲」那樣的，沒有偉大塲面的歌唱片的。</p>
<p>關於「駒影歌聲」的故事，那是並不曲折動人的，我所歡喜他的是一些人情味，大衛合家聞得他們的老二佐意在汽油站覓得工作了，那種喜悅的情狀和佐意的失業回家對照起來，是個很好的對比，「在資產階級得了統治的地方，他破壊了一切封建的，家長的，田園的關係。他無情地打破了結合人和他的「天然主宰」的複雜的封建聯繫，使人和人中間，只保存一種聯繫，即明目張膽的自利，刻薄寡情的「現金主義」。「資產階級已將家庭愛情底面帕扯破了，把家庭關係，弄成了單純的金錢關係」。「駒影歌聲」對於這樣的鐵律雖然沒有有意地來寫它，但它却無情地證明了它的正確，而在家庭關係成為「現金主義」的現實中，可憐的大衛們等合家，便在這裏面扮演了悲喜劇的脚色。「駒影歌聲」從表面上來看，是一齣有唱有鬧的喜劇，但我們細細地來回味一下，分析一下，它是在資產社會中小市民們經常在扮演的悲喜劇，也正因為這一點，我們就覺得「駒影歌聲」較之一般歌唱片來得可取。</p>
<p>導演者處理這個片子，是有其可取之點的，特別是在大衛等家庭間關係上，以及他們的或喜或怒中，很能够把握住這「小市民階層的悲喜劇」的喜怒無常來——這是由社會來跟他們决定的。</p>
<p>不過導演者雖有這一點好處，他却不能把這好處强固起來，淺嘗輒止，他還不能使人到過癮的地步。</p>
<p>這個戲的演員大部份我是喜歡的，茀萊麥茂萊，杜南奧康納，以列色白彼德蓀，愛倫堀露，都好，愛倫掘露還是個新人，戲雖不重，但在從小酒店和佐意乘車回來的那塲戲上，却顯示她是會有前途的，她有點甜，作風有點近乎愛琳鄧，不過比愛琳鄧來得天眞一點。</p>
<p>平克勞斯貝却並不見得怎樣好，他的那副傻頭傻腦的樣子，我是有點討厭的。幾支歌也平淡得很。</p>
<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第三回　仰遺容追思老義士　開文盲問字小先生</p>
<p>金澹雲道：「還有的是中國人本來有的，便說到它是落伍，一到由外國傅來時，又以為是時髦的，摩登的，眞是可笑。記得我的老太太曾講過，她在十四五歲的時候，小姑娘們曾流行染紅指甲。她們用鳳仙花搗爛了，加些什麼不褪色的材料，染在指甲上，以為美觀。到後來女孩子都進了學堂，這玩意兒早就不通行了，再有染紅指甲的，便有人笑她落伍了。誰知後來忽然有從歐美流行到中國來的，什麼染指甲用的呌做寇丹。一時年輕的太太們，小姐們，好似發狂一般，人人都把十指染的鮮紅，好像到血裏去抓了一把，這是什麼意思呢？總之中國的婦女們，崇拜歐美的物質，只知道盲從而已。後來經婦女改進會幾度警吿：說手指上塗着寇丹那種東西的，便表示自己是個懶惰的女子。因為天旣賦人以雙手，原是敎你做工的，不是敎你做裝飾品的。你把它塗得這樣紅紅的，顯見得你是一天到晚，束着手，不做什麼咧。這樣，漸漸的改變過來，而加以吾國女子，也人各有業，那種遊惰之風也自然的漸漸消滅了。到了現在，我們對於歐美先進國，自能取其所長，棄其所短，自己知所抉擇。旣不像最先對於外人那樣深惡痛疾，又不似後來對於外人那樣什麼都好的，這纔是對咧。」林建成道：「好了！我們飯也吃飽了，議論也發過了，我們去吧。此刻還是到公園裏去呢？還是到別地方去？」因為林建成和金澹雲是常來的，如今要請問何家兩位小姐。她們願意到公園中去散散步，林金兩人便陪着到公園裏來。原來這個公園，名字也呌做陵村公園，雖然拓地很寬，把個先烈墓環抱在中央，但有許多地方，設備沒有完備。這因為主持的人，取前進主義。與這個公園同時建築的，就是其中有一個博物館。那個博物館，却不是一種普通的博物館，乃是一種先烈紀念的博物館。這裏頭，關於先烈的一器一物，是資紀念的，都保藏在內。此外還有許多戰利品，也陳列了不少，如敵兵身邊的日記簿，小册子，佛印符咒，千人針，以及妻女的照片等等。（二七）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>談「好的報吿文學」</h3>
<p>— 秦佬</p>
<p>幾天前，「自由談」上有飛白先生底一篇談到報吿文學的文字，說因為讀了辛克萊底「不准敵人通過」，便「不免感到一點慚愧一，因為「十八個月來」，我們「簡直很少看到好的報吿文學」。這確是實在的情形，一點也不是「抹煞」的。不過這却引起了我底一點意見。</p>
<p>好幾年以前，有些批評家曾經主張過文學家是可以一手開槍，一手寫小說的。但後來終於　不出那樣的天才，纔證明了只是批評家在說夢話。自然，傳說上曾經有過馬上吟詩的作家，　但吟詩是可能的，寫小說可不行，而且吟出的詩也不會是「偉大」的詩。理由很簡單：小說最需要飛白先生所說的「藝術的描寫」，而作家要眞的去做「描寫」的工作，却多少要有一些事實上的條件。</p>
<p>巴比塞底「火」，不是在大戰的當時寫出來的；雷馬克底「西綫無戰事」，也不是在大戰的當時寫出來的。就以目前西班牙戰爭來說，始終還留在西班牙的作家就沒有見寫出「不准敵人通過」那樣「報吿文學的傑作」。荷蘭底名作家耶夫·拉斯特（Jef　Last）到西班牙去參加了戰爭，却只寫了幾篇通信，——自然，那倒可以說是「好的報吿文學」的，然而也不是「不准敵人涵過」那樣「報吿文學的傑作」。</p>
<p>雖然就是並不「偉大」的報吿文學，却也還得經過一般寫作的兩種過程：首先是要有「報吿」的材料；目前材料自然遍地都是，但跟着却是要有坐下去寫成「文學」的一點時間，用飛白先生底話，便是不「信筆直書」的一點時間。這倒不是好幾年前說夢話的批評家所攻擊的「把文學看成了神秘的東西」，而是實實在在的一個事實。要是文學不要坐下去的一點時間便可以寫出來時，那纔眞是「神秘的東西」了。現在住在上海和香港的作家自然是有一些的，他們也許有安心寫作的時間的罷，但那却畢竟是少數，而且也未必都是一向便專門從事於「文學」寫作的人。在我想來，「十八個月來」老實地在參加戰爭的文學作家，材料固然是用不完，但坐下去的時間却一定是很少的。</p>
<p>我並不是說，目前的報吿文學就應該是「流水賬似的，缺乏藝術的描寫，沒有感人的力量」（請愛加人帽子的批評家且慢點加我「悲觀主義」的帽子，如何？）我只是說，目前對於在鬥爭綫上奔走的作家暫且不必責備得太嚴。有「不准敵人通過」那樣「報吿文學的傑作」自然是最好，倘是沒有，只要有眞實的通信，眞實的紀事，只要是還用着文學的手法，而且還不算是壊的作品，就都不妨權且認為是過得去的報吿文學。那些作品能「有聲有色」，能「精采」，自然也是最好，但是這兒却也有一個事實上的問題：「十八個月來」能老實地參加戰爭的，只怕多半是些靑年作家，他們除了生活上難得到一點坐下去的時間而外，寫作上的技術大槪不免總要差一些。然而老作家又往往不肯像他們那樣去打滾，或者因為要準備將來的「傑作」，不顧意寫那些通信和紀事，這便是沒有法子的事。所以我們只有暫且用那些不算「有聲有色」，也不算「精采」的作品滿足一下自己再說。但這也只是暫且：那些作家會很快地用他們動人的生活把他們「筆尖下」的「故事」化為「有聲有色」，也化為「精采」的。</p>
<p>所以我以為，要是因為「簡直很少看到好的報吿文學」而「不免要感到一點慚愧」，那應該不是籠統地替一般的作家「慚愧」，而應該替幾個老作家「慚愧」纔對。（在這兒預先留下一句回答別個反問的話罷：假如我也是作家，而且假如也可以稱之曰老，我承認我也是逃不掉的一個）</p>
<p>至於飛白先生說到「將領訪問記之類」太多，這我倒認為是切實的忠吿。和將領合拍一張照像，請將領題幾個字或一首詩，接着自己也和一首，再鄭重地用銅版製了出來，結果都是和報吿文學不相干的。「訪問」自然是重要，但我以為最好還是多問一下士兵。從士兵底周圍一定可以得到更重要的村料，那材料一定能够使訪問者寫出「好的報吿文學」——雖然並不一定便是「偉大的報吿文學」。</p>
<h3>渡過了渦河</h3>
<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>——徐州突圍回憶記</p>
<p>天上疏疏的脥着幾點星，一輪殘缺的月亮，由樹林後面升起來了，滿地是一片像水銀似的淸暉，麥苗失去了嫩綠和生氣，平靜的在田野裏躺着。踏着像淡墨水畫的映在路上的樹影，隊伍默默的迅速的前進着，遠近的村落裏，不時有汪汪的狗吠聲，就像有敵人從那裏通過了似的。</p>
<p>懐着時時準備着廝殺的一顆緊張的心，興奮的跟着走着，不知甚麽時候竟安全的通過了？據說是有敵人在埋伏着的那幾個散佈在路旁的小村莊了</p>
<p>到了第二天早晨，當太陽在吐出了金黃的光輝時，隊伍走到了馨亭路上。為防敵人的坦克車衝來，路已被一節一節的挖斷了。這時，有幾個老百姓聽得我們的隊伍要走過這路上，正在自動的挖着土塡平了那挖斷的坑。</p>
<p>為那種難得的熱忱感動了，張師長便掏出三十塊錢來遞到他們的手裹：</p>
<p>「你們辛苦了，隨便拿着這幾文錢去買點東西吃吧。」</p>
<p>「你們帮我們去打××，我們怎麽還能要你們的錢？」那幾個老百姓揑着鋤頭，笑嘻嘻的讓讓着。</p>
<p>「你們不要客氣！」張師長把錢遞到一個老百姓的手裹。「你們就快點挖吧，我們的重砲就在後面要過來了。」</p>
<p>「是，是。」那幾個老百姓一面點着頭，一面便舉起鋤頭來挖着。</p>
<p>離開那幾個老百姓不遠，有一兩個小販在路旁擺着一點紙烟之類的東西在賣着。這時，從魯南撤退出來，沒有見過一個老百姓在賣東西的弟兄們，好像見了什麼寳貝似的，便層層疊疊的圍了起來，爭着購買着，那種希有的熱鬧，恐怕那賣紙烟的小販也要吃驚吧！</p>
<p>爬過了突兀的躺在田野裹的龍山，到了龍山鎮。站在街旁的老百姓，帶着一臉的驚惶望着我們，好像在詢問我們是不是敵人？</p>
<p>「老鄕，你們不要怕！我們是來打××的。」</p>
<p>「呵，你們辛苦了！」一個過了中年的漢子，回過頭去向他的家內呌着：「不要怕，他們是我們的軍隊，替我們來打××的，趕快提茶來！</p>
<p>「茶倒不必，老鄕，送我們一口冷水喝一喝好了！」</p>
<p>「好，提一桶冷水出來！」</p>
<p>兩扇緊閉着的門開脫了，一個小姑娘提着一桶冷水走出來，接着，這家那家也將門開脫，提着水出來慰勞我們了。</p>
<p>正坐在一家門前喝着水，忽然，一隻敵機飛來頭頂上盤旋着，站在街上的人馬忙躱到人家裏去，那隻敵機用機槍掃射試探了一會，無結果的便自己飛開了。</p>
<p>在龍山鎭休息了一會，在火熱的烈日下，隊伍又出發了，一點風也沒有，人熱得不住的流着汗，連衣服也給汗染濕了。</p>
<p>拖着一雙泡爛了淌着黃水的疼痛着的脚，吃力的走在那燙得要命的公路上，滿想到了渦陽總可以滿足十多天來的飢餓了，不想趕到了渦陽，那成千成萬的房子已被敵機轟炸成一片焦土，有的房子還在冒着殘烟，滿目是一片使人哭泣不得的殘坦斷木，一個老百姓也沒有。呵，這偉大的毀滅的功績，我們耍用甚麽來報答我們的敵人呢？</p>
<p>忽然，後面響起了機關槍聲，不用吿訴：我們後面的弟兄一定又同敵人接觸了！</p>
<p>剛才到渦陽的人馬，便一個個的跳進那漫流着的渦河裏，給水淹濕了衣服，涉着水渡過了渦河，忙散開蹲在城外高地上的那一條條戰壕裏……</p>
<p>奇怪，槍聲突然又疏下去了。</p>
<h3>國際危機</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>在德國的集中營裏（上）</h3>
<p>— 頑譯</p>
<p>在一位很知己的朋友面前說了兩句失愼的話，竟使我枉遭七個月納粹的恐怖拘禁。結果使我的重量减輕了四十磅，他們底權力甚至還踐踏到我底故鄕。</p>
<p>我在哥塔雷司拜訪嫂嫂的時候，遇見一位老年婦女，常她聽到我與妻子計劃着從新到美國去生活時，她克刺克刺捲着舌似很同情我們。我在無綫電的播唱上賺些錢；但最近，戈培爾底宣傳機關却禁止我做伶人了，主要的原因就是在七十五年前我底一位祖先因無遠見（？）而與一位猶太人結婚。</p>
<p>「你底失業實在太不幸了，」一位來拜訪嫂嫂的朋友這樣說，「你雖然唱得很好，但是你所能唱的，却祇是德國的歌曲呀！」她斜視着墻壁，接着半笑地指示着希特拉底畫像，那個最在熱的猶太人底侮辱者。</p>
<p>「唉，伶人！」我凄凉地喟嘆着，我伶人底生涯是完了！</p>
<p>六天後的一個黎明的早晨，在我慕尼黑的住宅裏，我與妻子忽然被那緊切的敲門聲所驚醒，我開了門，門前便矗立着兩個穿着那一望而知的制服的人。</p>
<p>「快穿好衣服　跟我們一同跑！」他們狂呌着。</p>
<p>「為什麽？」</p>
<p>「不許你們做事了！」</p>
<p>我安慰着我底妻子，吿訴她大槪在一小時左右我準可以回來的，但誰知道這就是七月前我與妻子最後一次的會面了！在司令部裏，我發現前面曾經說過的那位似乎很替我惋惜的婦人，那知她就是我們所稱為「百分之二百」的納粹黨員呢，她覺得已經成就了一件工作，將我底嘲弄的行動吿訴給秘密警察。</p>
<p>之後十天裏，我在慕尼黑的許多牢獄中，看淸其中四個牢獄底凄慘的內幕，本來祇能容納七個囚犯的單人獄室裹，現在却裝滿了二十個囚犯。有一天，我把常在我心上浮現的一個問題來詢問獄卒：在什麽時候我可以受審呢？</p>
<p>「受審嗎？」一個鬼樣的人憤憤地說着：「我在這裏等待受審已近兩年了，自從我加入了勞工營後便失業了一年，而且硬說在我的勞動的用器裏被他們發現一張共產黨的報紙。其實我可以吿訴你，我從未有過這張報紙！我不曾經過審判而被囚禁在這裏已經兩年了！——」</p>
<p>我們不得不叱責他，因為他說話的聲音太大了。</p>
<p>另外一個囚犯却是那法西斯蒂的最高團體——Scbutzstaffel底穿黑短褲的傢伙。他曾做過慕尼黑區外那可怕的集中營——德州的守衛。凡是彼解到這裹來的朋友，從他們的眼中可以看出恐怖已經恫嚇了他們的一切。為了避免更痛苦的懲罰，沒有一個人敢說出他一切恐怖的經歷。穿黑短褲的孩子為了遞兩枝香烟給那德州的囚犯，已經在慕尼黑的牢獄裏拘留了兩年了。</p>
<h3>冬之歌</h3>

<p>冬天，</p>
<p>我歌頌它。</p>
<p>狂雪，</p>
<p>暴風，</p>
<p>怎能阻滯春天的來臨？</p>
<p>郊原是一片死寂：</p>
<p>白雲垂着低幔，</p>
<p>衰草無盡，</p>
<p>鳥跡獸蹄作踐着大地。</p>
<p>春天是生命的先驅，</p>
<p>冬將是先驅的先鞭。</p>
<p>風霾是空明的渡橋，　　冬將是渡橋的基點。</p>
<p>不馳過艱辛的途程，　　怎到達光榮的岸邊？</p>
<p>冬天，</p>
<p>我歌頌它。</p>
<p>冷怯，顫抖，我沒有份，</p>

<h3>銀壇新訊</h3>
<p>— 晏然</p>
<p>最近，關於電影新聞的報導，有三件事似乎值得一提的：</p>
<p>（一）中宣部徵求暴行劇本：中委會宣傳部，爲明瞭各游擊區內日軍暴行的眞相起見，特登報徵求此項劇本，以便攝片後，分赴內地獻映，使內地民衆深刻地認識日軍在佔領區內的眞相，以及暴行之一斑，進而提高一般民衆的民族觀念，抗戰意識。聞此項劇本，共計錄取三名，第一名給獎三百元，第二名二百元，第三名一百元，截止期爲本年三月三十一日，本市劇作家，已有多人撰稿應徵其應徵稿件，爲避免檢查計，均托人往香港，再由香港付郵云。</p>
<p>（二）電影界拒與日方合作：日本國際映畫新聞社長井彩，現派人積極在本市活動，擬要求各電影公司，將國產影片輪流運往各游擊區內放映；同時，並有攫奪上海電影檢查權之企圖。但本市電影界，均深明大義，無論環境如何艱難，如何困苦，決不與日方合作。故日言雖屢次宴請各電影公司當局，但均無結果。聞日方曾有要求電影當局代拍影片之提議；而各公司當局，則答以：「代拍影片，在公司方面，只要取得相當代價，自無不可；惟戰後各公司之設施，均須先取決於全體工作人員，故第一步手續，尚須硍求全體工作人員之同意」云。此種堅決拒絕合作之表示，實爲上海電影界異常光榮之一頁，在民族抗戰過程中，殊令人欽佩無已。</p>
<p>（三）「卓別靈到上海」將脫稿：劇作家李阿毛氏（即滑稽小說家徐卓呆。）近受明星電影公司之委託，編一「滑稽爲經」「抗戰爲緯」之電影劇本，劇名「卓別靈到上海」，現阿毛博士正趁此學校寒假機會，加緊工作。不日行將脫稿，其收集的材料，都非常滑稽，令人笑痛肚皮，預料今春三四月間，或可公映。屆時定能轟動「孤島」影迷，咸以先覩爲快也。</p>
<h3>兪振庭逝世及其略歷</h3>
<p>— （桂花館主）</p>
<p>今年是梨園界的死人年，當代名伶先後謝世的計有楊小樓王又宸等多人。現在消息傳來，一代名武生俞振庭又於本月二十一日在北平前門外百順胡同本宅謝世，享年正六十歲。按俞伶自民國十七年放棄梨園生活後，至今已十有一年，其日常生活，頗稱安適，日以敎誨子孫爲樂。近數年始患痰症，時愈時發，不圖竟於日前以偶受風寒，竟致不起，茲述其生平各事於後，藉見一般。</p>
<p>俞氏出身　振庭之祖父曰小霞，爲當年崑曲小生中不可多得一代名伶，子菊笙（即振庭之父）藝名潤仙，有子三人，長即振庭，次子贊庭，三子華庭，菊笙之武生，因自成一派，楊小樓與尚和玉兩人均爲其入室弟子外，尚有兩人亦爲其傳人（名偶忘），故振庭之藝，胥得乃父衣缽眞傳。其</p>
<p>第一齣戲　即在北平楊立山家之堂會中，演其拿手傑作「金錢豹」。配猴子之人爲遲月亭，時俞年僅十八，就此名乃大噪。俞曾組雙慶社於故都，每期出演於文明園，所演名劇有艷陽樓，挑華車，鐵籠山，金錢豹等。范寶亭遲月亭，均爲當時班中要角。此後曾迭次應約於上海，南京，奉天，天津及其他各埠，均大獲歡迎，回平後又在華北戲院（即文明園）出演，不久因病輟演，時年五旬尚缺一歲也。</p>
<p>造就人才　其開辦斌慶社時，約在民國十三年（或云十四年），每期出演於廣德樓，社中造就人才甚多。如徐碧雲，趙綺霞，劉春升，朱斌仙，劉斌升，于斌安，耿斌福，小桂花，俞斌庭，王斌芬，李斌仙，毛慶來等，不下數十人，班外人如李萬春，王文源，楊寶森等，亦得益於該社不少。至其辦雙慶社時，則得其提掖之人尚有于連泉（筱悴花），梅蘭芳，高子君（慶奎）尚小雲（綺霞）等。胥受其益處者。</p>
<p>患難知己　俞性豪爽而好友，僅以梨園界言，生平之患難知己亦大有人在，如王瑤卿，蓋呌天，余叔岩，遲子俊，遲月亭，李春來等皆是。此外對同業中人，尤多解囊相助之處。故生平所蓄，近已因此而蕩然無存。</p>
<p>含笑而逝　最近患病甚劇，延至本月二十一日晨，家人已知不起，後事早經辦妥，至正午十二時，俞召家人至床前，因痰已上昇，致語多模糊，大約係言五子當努力上進一語，並手摸四子世龍之頭，直至下午五時三十分乃含笑而逝。</p>
<p>黃柏棺材　壽木係買自前門外大街鶴年長者，質爲黃柏，價八百元。壽衣等事爲瑞蚨祥者，價三百餘元。</p>
<p>伶界中人聞訊前往吊唁者甚多，至俞氏之原配夫人曹氏，現尚健存，已不問家事，聞爲當年某名伶之女，俞生平娶妾多人，已死其三，其第二妾即此刻主持家政者也，人甚精幹。俞氏靈柩已移往名寺三聖庵。將擇地安葬。</p>

<p>卡爾登義劇演溫如玉</p>
<p>卡爾登大戲院移風劇社定二月三號（星期五）日塲演唱救濟難民義務戲，已決定演溫如玉一劇，主角金鐘兒派由金素雯擔任，熙春另演他劇，（戲碼未派定）爲適合演員個性也，于素蓮彙演此劇而名噪一時，以素雯演文素臣劉璇姑之成績觀之則於溫如玉更有相當之收獲也。</p>
<p>顧無爲邀林樹森劇團</p>
<p>香港利舞台標準劇團主人顧無爲君，二度來申，下榻東亞旅館，此來任務，係邀聘名伶林樹森劇團赴港出演，雙方談判後，已告成局，前晚由顧付給定洋一千元，昨日中午，復往天天飯店簽訂合同，已定七號乘俄羅斯皇后輪首途，其餘乘澤生輪於八號動身，顧氏於三日內先行返港，</p>
<p>神秘夫人下嫁金不換</p>
<p>話劇坤旦蓓蕾（原名沈碧雲）加入大世界聯友劇團，抵坤旦范素琴之缺，擔任偵探名劇神秘的夫人之神秘夫人一角，演技純熟，頗受台下觀衆歡迎，現蓓蕾已定二月六號下嫁滑稽家金不換，由大世界遊藝主任閔采章君證婚，禮堂設在五福樓大廳，聯友同人均公份致賀，於是後台頻添神秘夫人下嫁金不換之一段佳話矣。</p>

<h3>蕭劇搬上銀幕的經過（下）</h3>
<p>— 張家鳳</p>
<p>那個朋友，借了一千法郎給他，巴斯噶就跑到路特迍去會那個帳房先生（他是倫敦的一個律師）。經過了十次的談判，他們還沒有商議定當。巴斯噶怎麼辦呢？那位律師索價極大，要先期付款，並且要求一切保證，而巴斯噶口袋裏的錢，卻一天一天少起來。最後他的錢全部用完。沿著路特迍船塢散步，他無意中看見一隻英國運貨船在一小時以內開到倫敦去。</p>
<p>『船長在那裏』？巴斯噶靈機一動的問。</p>
<p>『你問他幹什麽？』在他面前的一個水手回答說。『他大概在大路那邊的酒館裏？』</p>
<p>『船長』，那個匈牙利人請求那位高箇子的豪爽的人說『只有你可以救我的性命，我永遠感激你。』</p>
<p>馬斯噶極簡單的把他現在的處境告訴他他接得蕭伯納的回信，他與蕭伯納的帳房的商議不得要領。</p>
<p>『如果你帶我到倫敦去，我一定能夠會見蕭伯納，只要見到他，一切問題在半小時以內可以全部解決』。</p>

<h3>Future Endeavors Key to Determining Survival and Prosperity: Strengthen Unity, Strive to Implement Strategies for Later Stages of the War of Resistance, Pay Attention to Elevating National Spirit, Rectify Revolutionary Discipline, Japan's Violent Behavior Will Inevitably Lead It Into an Unrecoverable Abyss</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee issued a declaration at its closing ceremony.</p>
<p>The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Since the Provisional National Congress in April of last year, our Party, based on the resolutions of the Congress and the Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction, has led the people of the whole country in continuing to strive for the sacred war of resistance, while simultaneously carrying out the work of national reconstruction amidst the war of resistance. Over the past ten months, the military and the people have been of one heart and mind, and their will has become even stronger. Although the war zones have shifted, the foundation of the nation has become more solid. Since the loss of Guangzhou and the retreat from Wuhan, the situation of the war of resistance has shifted from the early stage to the later stage. The main purpose of the early stage of the war of resistance was to exhaust the enemy's strength, expose the enemy's conspiracy, and complete the strategy and deployment for the later stage of the war of resistance. The task of the later stage of the war of resistance is to inherit the achievements of the early stage of the struggle and to unleash all anti-Japanese forces in the front and rear and in the occupied areas in order to achieve final victory and the success of national reconstruction. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee is appropriately held today at the beginning of the later stage of the war of resistance. Recalling the war record of the past eighteen months, and the glorious sacrifices and contributions of our national soldiers and people, we deeply feel that the struggle that follows is the key to determining the survival and prosperity of our nation. We must conduct a detailed review of internal and external affairs, establish a strategy for the later stage of the war of resistance, and strive to implement it. Here, we present the key points to our comrades in the Party and to our compatriots across the nation, and sincerely report them. In the past ten months of the war of resistance, the enemy's invasion has become deeper, its military strength has been more depleted, and the crisis in its finances, economy, and society has become more serious. From the Battle of Southern Shandong to the battles on both sides of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, enemy casualties have increased by more than 500,000, and war expenses have increased to more than 900 million. Domestic political struggles have arisen repeatedly, and infighting has intensified. In the past few months, the enemy has issued its so-called "establishment of a new order in East Asia" declaration, hoping to use this fallacy to cover up its brutality. However, all countries in the world have seen through this hidden intention. The purpose of our sacred war of resistance is to seek national independence and national survival. Although we have lost a wide territory and suffered many casualties, the spirit of our national soldiers and people to fight the enemy with a common hatred has become more invigorated. Everyone is determined to die in order to build an eternal cause for the nation. Our country has always been a nation that loves peace. The reason why we are enduring a long war with perseverance and not hesitating to make any sacrifices is the result of the Japanese militarists' continuous use of force to invade, their wanton nibbling and swallowing, and their forcing us into a final impasse. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has brazenly disregarded everything, destroyed the Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations, and carried out the occupation of our four northeastern provinces. On July 7th of the previous year, it further displayed its tyranny by attacking Lugouqiao and occupying Beiping and Tianjin. The lifeline and destiny of our nation had reached a point of survival or extinction. The entire nation, from top to bottom, could no longer endure it. Therefore, although we knew that our military equipment and weaponry were inferior to the enemy's, in order to maintain the survival of our nation, we had no choice but to engage in a difficult and tragic war of resistance. If there is still a glimmer of hope for peace, we will never give up on peace. If the sacrifice has reached the final moment, we will certainly sacrifice. This is the determination that our Party's Commander-in-Chief has repeatedly stated, and it is also the national policy that our people unanimously adhere to. The ambition of the Japanese militarists to annex the mainland is, externally, the common enemy of the world, and internally, hated by the people. Looking at the years since the September 18th Incident, three of their prime ministers have been assassinated, two finance ministers have been assassinated, four or five admirals and generals have been assassinated, more than one hundred university professors have been arrested and imprisoned, and countless people have been imprisoned for opposing the war. The unity they maintain today is merely a manifestation of the militarists' tyranny. There is an ancient saying that, "When two armies meet, the one that grieves will win." The grief and indignation of our national compatriots in resisting aggression and the upright spirit of maintaining peace are sufficient to be the main force in overcoming the enemy. At the beginning of this later stage of the war of resistance, the most important thing for our compatriots across the nation is to jointly and consistently adhere to the meaning of the struggle. The declaration of the Provisional National Congress stated, "What we seek is a just peace, not a peace of surrender. Surrender will only encourage the arrogance of the aggressor. If China is frightened by Japan's violence and surrenders, seeking temporary security, then it will be reduced to a Japanese colony. The nation will lose its independent existence, and the freedom and equality of the country will be unattainable." As for the National Provisional Congress after the war of resistance, it even more clearly pointed out that in order to establish the integrity of the national territory and administration, and to realize a country of equality and freedom, we will never stop until our goal is achieved. Our Premier created the Three Principles of the People for revolution and national salvation, led the people to revive China and establish the Republic, to strive for national independence, to strive for national survival, to seek permanent peace in East Asia, and to establish a dignified example of righteousness for the world. The meaning of today's war of resistance is also the same. Japanese civilization initially sought it from Korea, and then learned it from our country. Everything from food, clothing, housing, and transportation to the principles of benevolence, righteousness, and morality, there is nothing that we have not given. Our country has been known for its prosperity and strength in East Asia for thousands of years, while Japan's strength has only been for several decades. Korea was destroyed by it long ago, and now it is further attempting to annex our China. Looking at the words of their militarists, they want to dominate the globe and conquer Europe and America. Their withdrawal from the League of Nations and tearing up the Nine-Power Treaty are only the beginning of their unleashing of violence on the world. The reason why our country is resolutely resisting today is not only to resist the enemy that is invading our country and to restore our sovereignty, territory, and administrative integrity, but also to punish the ringleader who destroys the dignity of treaties and endangers world peace. We earnestly hope that the peace-loving friends in the world will promote the spirit of unity and maintain the jointly beneficial treaties, implement effective methods, and eliminate the spread of war. Only in this way can we achieve peace for the people of the world and increase the happiness of mankind. This is the common understanding and unwavering determination of our 450 million people. Looking at the evolution of the international situation in the past year, it is quite similar to the eve of the European war in the past, and the depth and breadth of the crisis is far from comparable to the European war. Even taking the situation since the start of the war of aggression by Japan against China as an example, it has used its air force to bomb undefended cities, strafe civilians who are not combatants, and burn cultural buildings in cities and villages. The scenes of its cruelty and ferocity are not found in the European war. All countries, governments, and people in the world who love peace and uphold justice feel the same urgent response. In the past few years, those who only wanted to appeal with words and reaffirm the effectiveness of international law to stop the spread of war have now changed their approach and are simultaneously seeking to use their strength to create guarantees for self-defense and joint defense. As of today, no matter who it is, it is clear that Japan's invasion of China is the beginning of threatening the world's largest market between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Last autumn, the enemy forces invaded Wuhan and advanced to Guangzhou, blockading the two major rivers of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers. The League of Nations happened to be meeting at this time. Allied countries such as Britain, France, and Soviet Russia righteously exerted their efforts and unanimously supported the application of sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the Covenant to Japan's aggression. The League of Nations Administrative Council's resolution on January 19th recently invited countries concerned with the Far Eastern situation to consult with each other in order to take effective measures to provide assistance to our country. At the same time, U.S. President Roosevelt firmly upheld the Nine-Power Treaty and issued a firm warning to the brutal Japan. Britain and France followed suit and jointly maintained the treaty. The purpose of this is not only to stop the brutal Japan's aggression but also to eliminate all the tragedies that destroy world peace. Our country, at a time of hardship, deeply appreciates and will never forget this noble friendship of supporting those in danger. We are also confident that our Chinese nation will contribute its utmost sincerity in upholding justice and righteousness to the future of human civilization and world peace, and will certainly live up to the expectations of our friendly countries. We are even more convinced that our Republic of China has the essence to eliminate world wars and promote a peaceful life for humanity. When the European war had just ended, the countries involved in the great war were suffering from a lack of solutions for the aftermath. Our Premier then published his great plan to develop China's industries and believed that only this great plan could fulfill the international peace advocated by President Wilson at that time, eliminate the causes of international wars caused by the post-war countries following the old path of commercial war, and save the country and the people.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Spanish War and the European Crisis</h3>
<p>Since the Italian-German fascists and the Spanish Nationalist forces jointly captured Barcelona, the Spanish resistance has entered a more serious and difficult stage. However, the Spanish war has not ended as Mussolini and his ilk had hoped ("it can be declared over immediately"), not only has it not ended, but the Spanish government forces are still determined to fight to the end, having established a new defense line to hold out against the fascist invading forces for a long time, so that the invaders will never be able to conquer Spain. This assertion is based on the following three points:</p>
<p>First, the Spanish government forces still possess elite main forces and have not been weakened by the fall of Barcelona. The Spanish government forces' abandonment of Barcelona was clearly a "strategic retreat," a withdrawal without a decisive battle. Therefore, Spain still possesses 500,000 elite main force troops.</p>
<p>Second, the Spanish government still controls more than one-third of the country's vast territory, which can serve as a base for continuing the resistance. The fall of Barcelona will not deal it a fatal blow. As Aguirre, the president of the Basque Autonomous Government, rightly said: "Based on our thirty months of experience, we know that the victory or defeat of a war cannot be determined by the gain or loss of a single city. We are fighting for fundamental principles, and we will continue to fight until we achieve final victory!"</p>
<p>Third, the Spanish resistance is not only its own problem but also a matter of European and even world peace. Therefore, it has the support of justice-loving people all over the world. Today, the call to "aid Spain" has resounded in every corner of the world. This torrent of sympathy from the people of the world will inevitably converge into a huge force of assistance one day.</p>
<p>From the above narrative, it can be seen that although the Spanish resistance has become increasingly difficult due to the fall of Barcelona, it still possesses the conditions for achieving final victory. Naturally, on the other hand, the fall of Barcelona will inevitably have a serious impact on the European situation, and this impact is already evident in fact:</p>
<p>First of all, the fall of Barcelona not only struck a blow to the Spanish government but also threatened France and Britain's hegemony in the Mediterranean. Barcelona is located on the south side of the Pyrenees, close to the French border, and the threat to French security is undoubtedly great. Moreover, Italy will inevitably take advantage of its position in Spain to intensify its pressure on France, which France has already keenly felt.</p>
<p>Secondly, the fall of Barcelona will inevitably further fuel the arrogance of the Berlin-Rome axis. Hitler has decided on a new expansion plan and is about to deliver a speech. According to the Associated Press, he will not only demand the return of colonies but also demand 200 billion pounds in reparations. As of the time this manuscript was sent to print, Hitler's speech had not yet been received, but London and Paris are eagerly awaiting his speech.</p>
<p>In short, the more fascist forces advance in Spain, the more precarious the situation in Europe becomes. The current situation in Europe is changing around the Spanish war. We must not deny that Spain has reached a critical juncture today. But it is not too late for the British and French authorities to suddenly change their course, abandon the illegal "non-intervention" policy, and give Spain active assistance to save the critical situation!</p>
<p>However, after reading the speeches of French Foreign Minister Bonnet and British Prime Minister Chamberlain, it is known that these two countries still have no intention of abandoning the "non-intervention" policy. Chamberlain even indicated that he would continue his appeasement policy of condoning aggression, which will only promote war.</p>
<p>Recently, Mussolini, seeing the bleak prospects of the Spanish war, proposed convening a new Munich conference to resolve the Spanish problem. The Munich Conference sacrificed Czechoslovakia in one fell swoop, opening the way for the Nazis to advance eastward. Now, Italian fascists are jealous and want to hold a new "Munich" to destroy Spain, strike at France, Britain, and even the gathering point of world democratic forces. Will Chamberlain, who has consistently worked to "appease," direct this again?</p>
<p>A new Munich conference may or may not be convened; this depends on Spain itself. Spain is different from Czechoslovakia; Spain is firmly resisting. Its answer will be resistance, resistance, resistance to the last person!</p>
<p>The people of the world have recognized that the struggle of the Spanish people is a struggle of peace and progress against fascism. The future of Europe will be determined by the duel at the foot of the Pyrenees. Peace-loving people all over the world must rise up, break through the shackles of "non-intervention," and shatter the "appeasement" policy of condoning aggression, giving the Spanish government active assistance!</p>
<p>Regarding the idea of saving people and the world, this great work repeatedly explains that Japan will inevitably intensify its aggression against China, and countries all over the world will inevitably fall into an inextricable predicament. Although it was said twenty years ago, the facts that have been exposed now are all consistent. Our national citizens, everyone following the teachings of the Premier, should all believe in this classic of saving the country and the world. Now, the US President specially invokes the Nine-Power Treaty to call on the world to uphold the treaty in order to restore peace in East Asia. The member states of the League of Nations also know that the US President's proposition is the forerunner of the common happiness of the world. However, the madness of the violent sun is raging, and the actions of various countries have not yet manifested. If they want to suppress the violent sun's full success, they must further affirm the true meaning of the treaty. The major principles of the Nine-Power Treaty are two: one is to respect China's sovereignty, territory, and administrative integrity, and the other is the open door and equal opportunity. If you examine the spirit of the treaty in detail and observe the current facts, you will know that the second principle cannot be realized unless the righteousness of the first principle is promoted and its practical effect is ensured. To certify the Premier's plan to develop Chinese industries suggested to the world twenty years ago, it is enough to confirm that our citizens not only support the principle of the open door, but also are willing to cooperate with the world's countries in mutual assistance and peace on the principle of fairness and mutual assistance. In the conclusion of the Premier's plan to develop Chinese industries, the most pertinent words are, one, "Japan always obtains the greatest reward at the end of each war. No wonder the Japanese warlords regard war as the most profitable business. Now that China has awakened, Japan wants to implement its policy of aggression, and the Chinese will inevitably come out to reject it. Even if China is unfortunately occupied by Japan, Japan will never be able to rule it favorably at any time and place."; two, "(If the powers act truthfully to cooperate and consider the common interests, then the militarism will not be able to use their tricks to fight China for material things.)"; three, "(Those who seek to develop China's economy jointly for the mutual assistance of all countries can realize it, and those who seek the private interests of individuals or a nation should disappear invisibly.)" We follow the Premier's will and examine the international trends carefully. The belief that the Anti-Japanese War will be victorious and the nation will be built is already firmly immutable. At this time when sacred sacrifices have exerted unparalleled light, we especially hope that the soldiers and civilians of the country will vigorously promote the spirit of struggle, bravely advance to strive for the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and lay the foundation for the construction of the Republic of China, so as to cooperate sincerely with the friendly countries of the world under the principle of mutual assistance and peace, and complete the great cause of building the Republic of China. Only in this way can we not live up to the heroic sacrifices of our millions of compatriots, and let our national citizens and their children and countless people in the world share the peaceful happiness created and guaranteed by our soldiers and civilians with their lives in infinity. The crazy thoughts, cunning attempts, and cruel acts of the Japanese warlords, which are being inflicted on our country today, will also lead to more tragic consequences for them to suffer. Since the September 18th Incident, the rebellious incidents that have been constantly occurring in their country have exposed their beginnings. Since the July 7th Incident, the evil consequences caused by the brutal actions may be even more numerous than the weapons and violence used to kill compatriots. Understanding the above, it can be known that resolutely resisting Japan is a consistent mission of the National Revolution, and it is also our only sincerity to save the country and the world. The crazy and cunning acts of the violent enemy are not only futile, but they will inevitably fall into a deep abyss from which they cannot extricate themselves. The plenary session believes that the determining factors of the final victory or defeat in the later stage of the Anti-Japanese War have already been planted in the past, and the spirit of bravery, loyalty, and unity of purpose of our soldiers and civilians from the beginning of the war to the present, as well as the actions of the world's friendly countries in upholding justice and safeguarding the treaty, have further established the foundation for our country's inevitable victory. Only because of this, from now on, our responsibility is even more arduous. If we want to defeat the violent enemy's last and most ferocious aggression, we must also exert all the heart and strength of our national citizens, and jointly devote ourselves to strengthening unity, actively struggling, and making efforts to build the country, and raising the national spirit to rectify revolutionary discipline, which is the guarantee for the success of the above three things. The main points are hereby revealed as left: (1) The so-called strengthening of unity, the meeting believes that unity must be based on sincerity, and the revolutionary spirit must seek its purity. The Provisional National Congress solemnly declared, hoping that the people of the country with aspirations would focus on the party and fight together. This meeting is now earnestly hoping that the country is in such a critical situation that we must try our best to increase the strength of resisting Japan and building the country, so as to achieve the effect of the people's aspirations becoming a city. Compatriots across the country, regardless of their past political views and factions, all those who are willing to practice the Three People's Principles and participate in the sacred cause of the National Revolution, the Anti-Japanese War, and the building of the country are sincerely welcome. However, the purpose of the National Revolution is to seek the independence of the country and the survival of the nation, so we must maintain the sincere and pure spirit of the Chinese nation, and then the foundation of the country can be permanently solidified. This meeting solemnly declares that we absolutely do not want to see the fact that the party leading the revolution has dual party membership, and we cannot bear to see the consistent ambition of China to practice the Three People's Principles and complete the revolutionary nation-building suffer setbacks due to the lack of firm belief and will. When the countries of the world began the revolution and nation-building, they were able to overcome difficulties and achieve success because the whole country was united and the upper and lower levels were of one mind. There is absolutely no second way in ancient and modern China and abroad. From now on, our compatriots must unite in spirit, do their best to be loyal, believe in and practice the Three People's Principles, make the best efforts for the later stage of the Anti-Japanese War, and lay an unshakable foundation for the great cause of nation-building. (2) The so-called active struggle, our compatriots should know that "walking a hundred miles is half ninety," and the last journey is often the most difficult. When we review all the work in the past, we have not tried our best, and what we have tried has not been completely certain, uncoordinated, or consistent in words and deeds. Contribute its full strength to adapt to the needs of wartime. The later stage of the Anti-Japanese War is actually the final success or failure of our country and the Japanese warlords. If all thoughts and actions in the front and rear, especially in the occupied areas or the soldiers and civilians near the war zone, cannot be strictly reflected, strictly reported, and strictly corrected, and if their abilities, freedom, and lives are completely contributed to the country, increasing the strength of the counterattack, then the achievements of countless martyrs' sacrifices and struggles will be in vain, and our nation will inevitably perish. Therefore, my comrades and compatriots, from now on, must share their loyalty, under the leadership of the Supreme Commander, without reservation, without hesitation, and move forward bravely to win the success of national independence and national survival in this great battle of life and death. (3) Regarding stepping up construction, we must know that the main force of nation-building lies in building an army. Without a national army as strong as gold and stone, people's livelihoods will not be guaranteed, people's rights will not be maintained, and the nation will not survive. Psychological construction, political construction, and economic construction are the foundation of building an army. The so-called psychological construction must be based on the Premier's theory of knowing is difficult and doing is easy, promote the Premier's main purpose of military spirit education, popularize national military training, enhance the effectiveness of education, promote wartime services, so that all compatriots in the country are revolutionary fighters of the Three People's Principles, and seek the final victory with the spirit of success or benevolence. The so-called political construction lies in strict rewards and punishments, comprehensive examination of names and realities, concentration of strength, increased efficiency, strengthened mass organizations, unified mass actions, relief of people's suffering, and improvement of people's lives. At the critical juncture of the beginning of the later stage of the Anti-Japanese War, where the survival of the country is at stake, it is especially appropriate to form a unified command organization of the central party, government, and army, so that the work of the national party and government can be closely integrated with the military, so as to achieve the effect of joint action. Therefore, the Supreme National Defense Committee is specially established to unify the command of the party, government, and army. Regarding economic construction, it is not only related to the victory or defeat of the Anti-Japanese War, but also to the success or failure of nation-building. It must be based on the needs of the people's lives in wartime, distinguish between priorities, consider the urgency, implement controlled economic regulation of the production and consumption of materials, and do our best to vigorously promote heavy industries and mining industries necessary for the Anti-Japanese War, light industries necessary for people's daily use, railways, air lines, and highways needed for transportation. We must consolidate the currency system, facilitate finance, and promote the development of public and private industries. We must also improve agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, develop the country's resources, and increase the production capacity of various provinces. We must make concerted efforts between the government, the people, all capital, and technology to earnestly step up promotion. This economic construction is not only to enrich the strength of the Anti-Japanese War, but also to implement the foundation of people's livelihood. As for the governments and people of friendly countries in the world who provide mutual assistance in material and financial resources during the Anti-Japanese War, or provide spiritual and moral support, or relieve the soldiers and civilians who are wounded, sick, hungry, and cold, or help us to restore schools destroyed by the enemy, all these noble meanings will be eternally remembered. I am convinced that the result of this Anti-Japanese War in our country will be able to restore the integrity of our national sovereignty, territory, and administration, and will be able to revive the authority of the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Pact of Paris. Not only will the principle of the open door and equal opportunity be implemented, but also the great plan proposed by our Premier to the world twenty years ago for the international peace and mutual assistance combination and joint development of Chinese industries will be realized here. With our richness of raw materials and the vastness of the market, and the urgency of construction needs after the war, in terms of absorbing foreign investment and technical cooperation, observing the existing capabilities of various industrial countries, there is absolutely no fear of its excess. Today, if the people of our country put in more effort, they will surely gain ten or a hundred times the benefits after the war. All true economic benefits are never private to the world and mankind. The above three things are the goals that our country should actively strive for, and the fundamental key lies in improving the national spirit and rectifying revolutionary discipline to realize the Three People's Principles of revolutionary nation-building. In the past, when the Premier gave lectures on the military spirit education, he explained in detail that "human beings have the use of spirit and do not rely solely on the physical body," and "if you want to undertake extraordinary undertakings, you must rely on extraordinary spirit." He specially cited wisdom, benevolence, and courage as the morals that revolutionaries and patriots must possess. Only wisdom that "conforms to morality" is the wisdom needed by the revolution. Only those who can "dare to go forward and never retreat in the face of adversity, and have the determination to die without hesitation" are the courage needed by the revolution. Only those who "sacrifice their lives to save the world, sacrifice their lives to save the country, do not ask about interests, and do their best to fulfill their responsibilities" are the benevolence on which the revolutionary cause depends for its success. There is no seeking life to harm benevolence, but there is killing life to achieve benevolence, starting with great wisdom and ending with great courage, before we can build the country, complete the revolution, and protect the endless life of our nation. At this critical juncture of life and death, my compatriots across the country can only be determined to become benevolent and take righteousness, practice the great way of the Three People's Principles, everyone swear to die, bravely be loyal, use our decades of mortal lives to establish the foundation of the country's eternal life for hundreds of millions of years, then there is no fear that the Anti-Japanese War will not be victorious, and there is no fear that the nation will not be built. All party comrades and all personnel in charge of national military and political affairs should especially be aware of their own responsibilities and the seriousness of revolutionary discipline, set an example and be the first to serve the people. We must establish strict discipline, establish the justice of rewarding merits and punishing demerits, and then we can gather the people's will into one mind and combine the people's strength into one body. We must not endanger the country due to the loss of one corner, or harm the public due to the mistake of one person. We must know that in the Anti-Japanese War, the life-and-death struggle with the enemy is in an instant, and the great cause of nation-building is a permanent and indestructible work. If it is not followed by strict discipline, how can we achieve the practical results of success? Therefore, the strict implementation of revolutionary discipline is the thorough revival of the spirit of the Anti-Japanese War. This is the greatest guarantee for the victory and success of the Anti-Japanese War and nation-building, and we must do our best to implement it. Our party, based on the historical mission of revolutionary nation-building, leads the entire people with firm determination at the autumn of national crisis and survival. The heavier the responsibility, the more difficult the mission, all my comrades must sincerely abide by the resolutions, be of one heart and one mind, accept the President's instructions to improve party morals and consolidate the foundation of the party, invigorate the spirit, concentrate the will, strengthen the faith, enrich the ability, go deep into the war zone, go deep into the occupied area, go deep into the countryside, work hard and persevere, set an example, and must go to the front first in the face of difficulties. With this spirit, do our best to fulfill our duties, and with this spirit, impress China and foreign countries. As for my compatriots across the country, hearing righteousness may have a sequence, but there is absolutely no difference in practicing righteousness. The ability of this Anti-Japanese War to persist without wavering and to overcome all difficulties is actually the great achievement of all compatriots across the country who are determined to sacrifice everything to engage in the great cause of saving the country and building the nation. Now the Anti-Japanese War has entered the later stage, and the great success is only one basket away. Those who gain the Tao will get more help, and the sympathy of the world has been gathered in our country. Those who have the will will achieve their goals, and the great achievement of rejuvenation will surely belong to our people. I hope that all party comrades and compatriots across the country will understand this meaning and devote all their efforts to it. (30th telegram)</p>
<h3>Telegraphic Message of Condolences to Anti-Japanese War Soldiers and Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee specially sent telegraphic messages of condolences to all Anti-Japanese War soldiers and commendations to overseas Chinese. The original texts are recorded on the left: (1) Military Commission Chairman Chiang to all Anti-Japanese War soldiers: Since the war of resistance against the enemy, our soldiers in the war zones, under the unified command of the Supreme Commander, have been loyal and courageous, persevering with the enemy for a long time, and have achieved a solid foundation for the Anti-Japanese War and nation-building after a year and a half of struggle, making the people of the country more aware of the Anti-Japanese War and strengthening their confidence. The annihilation of stubborn enemies is just around the corner. This meeting reviews the past and encourages the future, and sincerely commends the meritorious service. I hope that you will continue to work hard and achieve complete success as soon as possible. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. (2) Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission translates to all overseas Chinese: The violent sun is invading China with all its national strength. Our country has risen up to resist Japan in order to defend its sovereignty and strive for independence. After eighteen months of arduous efforts to defend the country, we have been able to consume the enemy's strength, defeat its fierce offensive, and put it in a predicament where it is difficult to advance or retreat and its will to fight is frustrated. This is indeed due to the Supreme Commander's effective supervision and the loyalty and courage of all the soldiers, and the love of the motherland and the enthusiastic donations of our overseas Chinese, and the international justice has also been extended because of this. The concerted efforts of the group are huge and grand, and the distant thoughts and enthusiasm are appreciated and relied on. Now, at the beginning of the second phase of the Anti-Japanese War, it is the most important key to success or failure. I hope that our overseas Chinese will deeply understand this and work harder to achieve complete success. This is our earnest hope. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. (30th telegram)</p>

<h3>British Cabinet Reorganization, Accelerating Armaments Expansion, Currently Completing One Warship Per Week, Monthly Production Reaching 700 Aircraft</h3>
<p>(London) Britain's armaments expansion program is now being actively pursued. The appointment of former First Sea Lord Admiral Chatfield as Minister for Coordination of Defence Affairs indicates that the government's activities in national defence must be accelerated, and their scope will be even more extensive than what has already been achieved. Regarding the naval sector, First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Samuel Hoare recently declared that British shipyards could complete more than one warship per week in a short period. Naval figures attach great importance to this. Moreover, there are seventeen battleships under construction, at least twelve of which will have their tonnage increased from 35,000 tons to around 40,000 tons, so that the British Navy's superiority over other countries can be maintained and enhanced. As for the recruitment of naval personnel, a special reserve force can be established without ordering mobilization. Regarding the army, the government is currently conducting widespread propaganda to recruit new soldiers, but the results are still difficult to predict. Regarding the air force, British aircraft factories can currently produce 400 aircraft per month. Well-informed sources believe that this can be increased to 700 aircraft between June and July of this year. At that time, the difference between the British and German aircraft production rates will be rapidly reduced. However, one thing must be noted: British aircraft industry need not be forced, while German factories, due to accelerated production, have some of their machinery already outdated. (29th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The changes in the British cabinet have attracted great attention here, especially the appointment of Lord Chatfield as Minister for Coordination of Defence Affairs, which is considered the most important. It is said that his mission will be to pave the way for new sacrifices, as the accelerated pace of rearmament in all areas will require the entire nation to make these new sacrifices. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Lord Strathcona, Director-General of Munitions Production at the War Office, recently resigned due to dissatisfaction with the progress of armaments expansion. Recently, Overseas Trade Secretary Hudson also submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Chamberlain for the same reason. The Prime Minister, relying heavily on him, persuaded him to stay, and Hudson withdrew his resignation. (12th Havas dispatch)  Official Trotter. The British government has ordered 200 military aircraft from the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation in the United States. Fourteen of these were shipped from here to Liverpool, England, today on the "Lochavon" ship. These aircraft are monoplanes, equipped with two Wright Cyclone 200 horsepower engines, and their range can reach 3,000 kilometers. (29th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain's Speech, Satisfied Germany and Italy</h3>
<p>Italian Newspapers Still Attacking France</p>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers have published Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in Birmingham on Saturday night in a very prominent position. Although there are several points in Chamberlain's speech that are not welcomed by Berlin, the newspapers' criticisms are generally brief and commendatory, stating that Germany desires peace, but peace must be just and equitable among equal nations. The inaccurate information published in several British and French newspapers has created a bad atmosphere. General Goering's mouthpiece, the National Daily, stated that the Prime Minister does not seem to distinguish between peace-loving people and their governments, and asked whether the Prime Minister was referring to the United States, France, or the Soviet Union. The newspaper believes that there is not much hope for disarmament, as Britain's rearmament will naturally be followed by other countries. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian Daily editor Guido Gayda recently published an article in the Italian People's Voice, a weekly publication of the newspaper, expressing approval of Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech on Saturday, calling it a clear and sincere speech, and listing Chamberlain's proposals for seeking a practical plan for European peace through negotiation, saying that we can unhesitatingly acknowledge its sincerity. Italy wishes to see the cooperation advocated in Chamberlain's proposal put into practice. Gayda also stated that Italy has no demands on Britain, only asking that it understand certain major issues that have no impact on Britain. Therefore, if Britain can stay away from harmful forces within the country and the oppression of other powers that oppose the rights of Italy and Germany, there should be no obstacles between Britain and Italy. However, it is still unknown when the selfishness of those who have too much and the needs of those who have too little can be reconciled. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) The People's Post recently commented on the relations between France and Italy, comparing 20th-century France to ancient Carthage (located in present-day Tunis in North Africa), stating that Italy's intervention in the Spanish Civil War was motivated not only by ideology but also by military strategy. The Carthaginian general Hannibal once invaded Rome via Spain. Now, France can also mobilize Libyan troops from Africa and invade Italy through Spain, which must be prevented in advance. "Prime Minister Mussolini now wants to destroy the path of barbarian attacks on Rome in the Mediterranean, which can be compared to the Roman general Scipio, who defeated Hannibal." (29th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Stampa newspaper recently stated that Italy's desires in the Mediterranean are most concerned with Corsica and Tunisia. "In the minds of Italians, Corsica and Tunisia represent a thing, a soul. This thing and soul have existed for us for centuries, and successive generations have had a definite desire for them. The realization of this desire is not far off. Although we do not know when it will be realized or how it will be realized, one thing is certain: the ideals of an entire nation cannot be overcome by various strategies." (29th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Thousands of residents of Modane in the Savoy region of France recently held demonstrations near the Italian border, led by the mayors of various villages and towns, protesting against Italy's proclaimed desires. In addition to holding French flags, the demonstrators also displayed various slogans, saying "Savoy is one with France" and "The French colonial empire belongs to France." The demonstrators marched for two kilometers, and all the houses along the way responded by hanging flags, even the houses inhabited by Italians. (According to reports, there are many Italians in this area.) The demonstrators then arrived at the war memorial of the city to the sound of the French national anthem, where the chairman of the city council gave a speech, declaring that the people of Savoy are loyal to their motherland.

<h3>German Parliament Opens, Hitler Speaks</h3>
<p>Sixth Anniversary of the Nazi Party's Rule, Goebbels Says Three Difficulties Have Been Overcome</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today is the sixth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule, as well as the opening day of the first parliament of Greater Germany. Führer Hitler will attend and deliver an important speech, which is highly anticipated by the people of the whole country. National flags have been hung everywhere here, and white columns have been built on the major roads leading to the Kroll Opera House (the parliament meeting place), with large flags hanging on them, which is very spectacular. Loudspeakers are installed in various squares for the public to listen to the Führer's speech. Pedestrians give way on the road, as if it were a festival. All schools are closed. According to official announcements, the Governor of Austria, Ingard, and the Commissioner of the Sudetenland, Henlein, will sit together in parliament, symbolizing the completion of the Greater German nation. Führer Hitler was very busy this morning and received the people who won the National Literature and Science Awards last year at noon and awarded them medals. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The troops stationed around Berlin beat drums and played music this morning to participate in the sixth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule. The troops paraded through the main streets, and the formation was neat and moving. The red, black, and white swastika flags were hung in every street. A large number of workers are still very busy repairing the grand theater in order to have the parliament meet tonight. The time when Hitler addresses the parliament is expected to be after 7:30 in the evening (30th Reuters dispatch). Tonight, when Hitler goes to the parliament, additional electric lights will be installed on the streets he passes through, so that it can be seen as daytime, to highlight Hitler's elegance. (30th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a radio speech to the youth of the entire country today on the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule, saying that the Third Germany has no other way out than National Socialism. Goebbels emphasized that six years ago, on January 30, 1933, when Hitler came to power, Germany faced three difficulties: (1) no strong army to defend the borders, (2) a wavering foreign policy, and (3) a huge number of unemployed people. Today, all three difficulties have been broken. "German youth do not need to learn history in schools, but witness the creation of history. The special significance of this year's commemoration is that Germany has become a Greater Germany." He ended by calling for "the youth of the whole country to unanimously support the Führer."

<h3>Spanish Government Troops Defend New Front Line</h3>
<p>Nationalist Troops Also Make Progress</p>
<p>(London) After the Spanish government troops withdrew from Barcelona, they have now established a new line of defence and are fiercely resisting. According to a dispatch from Burgos, the Nationalist troops on all fronts are advancing an average of five miles. According to news from Girona, fierce battles are currently taking place in some areas. The Chief of Staff of the government troops declared that the military news received is all favorable.

<p>Figueres. Yesterday, many refugees in this city, supporting the old and carrying the young, went to the Jonquera area to wait for trains to France. The situation was very chaotic for a time, but today it has gradually returned to normal. The highway from this city to the Jonquera area has also been cleared. The food problem has been resolved. The most pressing problem at present is the housing problem. In addition to requisitioning empty houses to accommodate refugees, the government is also working hard to evacuate the population as a fundamental solution. Nationalist aircraft bombed this city several times this morning. In addition to some material losses, there were few casualties among the residents. After the various departments of the Republican government moved here, they have now resumed normal operations. The cabinet regularly holds meetings to discuss the overall plan for the war of resistance. In addition, most of the members of parliament have also arrived here from various places one after another, and the parliament will be convened for a reconvening within days. As far as the war situation on the front line is concerned, the situation is very optimistic. Government troops launched a counterattack this afternoon in Mataró and Alella, which was very successful. (29th Havas date)</p>
<p>Barcelona After the Nationalist troops won in Catalonia, they have almost completely taken control of all the textile industry in the country. The number of textile factories destroyed in the war is not very large. Seventy percent of them can be restored to work with a little reorganization. The main problem now is the lack of funds. The machinery and raw materials of all factories were originally purchased from London. Now there is no cash, and it is necessary to first obtain credit from the United Kingdom in order to be able to help. In addition, there are also difficulties in transportation. Most of the highway bridges have been destroyed by artillery fire, and the continuous flow of military vehicles has blocked the supply of food to the residents, let alone other things. Taking this port as an example, its transportation with the Balearic Islands can only be carried out after all the mines placed by the government troops have been cleared in order to transport food here.

<h3>British Parliament to Discuss Aid to China Today</h3>
<p>Zhang Pengchun is Popular in London, Indian Alliance Advocates Boycott of Japanese Goods</p>
<p>(London) Although the British House of Commons will focus on the overall European situation in tomorrow's foreign policy debate, members who are paying attention to the situation in China will work hard in the next session to strengthen the government's position so that it can take more active actions in the Far East to help China and protect British interests in China. This week, many newspapers have repeatedly stated that the Far Eastern situation is becoming increasingly serious.

<h3>US Aircraft Sales to France Cause Discord</h3>
<p>(Washington) A new type of aircraft manufactured by a US aircraft factory crashed during a test flight on the 23rd of this month in Los Angeles, killing many people. As a result, the French aviation department representatives Schmidlin and his party are in trouble. It is heard that discord has arisen between the Navy Department and the Army Department. Although no one has criticized the French government's right to order aircraft from US factories, the US Army Headquarters has criticized the Navy Department for allowing foreign military officers to participate in the test flight of new types of aircraft for the Army, which is beyond its authority.

<p>(Washington) The US Congress will reconvene this week. The main issues to be discussed at that time will be related to foreign affairs and national defense. It is generally believed that the most important of these are (1) the sale of aircraft by various aircraft factories to France and other countries, (2) the establishment of a naval base on Guam in the central Pacific and its funding, (3) the internal problems of Spain, and (4) the diplomatic relations between the United States and Mexico, especially the debt problem of the US oil companies whose oil mines were nationalized by the Mexican government.

<h3>Molotov Announces Completion of the Second "Five-Year Plan"</h3>
<p>Industrial Development Rate Ranks First in the World; However, Total Production is Still Deemed Insufficient; The Third "Five-Year Plan" Emphasizes Chemistry</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Eighteenth National Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, scheduled to convene on March 10th, will hear a report from Molotov, Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee, on the state of economic development. The report, to be presented for discussion, states that the Second Five-Year Economic Plan has been completed, all classes engaged in exploitation have been eliminated, and the collectivization of agricultural economic organizations, as well as the sustained cultural revolution, have been successful. Once the Third Five-Year Economic Plan is implemented, its effects will be that all kinds of equipment will be technologically suited to the needs of national defense, and economic independence will be achieved. At that time, industrial production, national income, and the circulation of goods will certainly increase dramatically, work efficiency can be improved by sixty-five percent, and the cost of industrial products can be reduced by eleven percent. After agricultural mechanization, the amount of agricultural produce can be increased, 11,000 kilometers of railway lines can be added, and regular shipping routes can be established between the country and the Far East. All these achievements require the sequential implementation of the planned program. The main conditions are as follows: (1) In 1942, the last year of the Third Five-Year Economic Plan, the value of industrial production should increase to 180,000,000,000 rubles; (2) the output of coal mines should be increased; (3) oil stations should be added in the Volga and Ural river basins; (4) a liquid fuel industry should be established in the east; (5) the chemical industry should be developed; (6) four million specialized workers should be trained, and six hundred thousand workers should be instilled with deeper knowledge; (7) secondary schools should be opened in various cities, and children in all townships should be required to attend school from the age of seven. (Havas Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Local newspapers recently published the main points of Molotov's report to the Eighteenth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party on March 10th regarding the Third Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet National Economy. The article first pointed out that as a result of the successful completion of the Second Five-Year Plan, its main historical tasks have been completed, all exploiting classes have been eliminated, and all factors that could lead to exploitation of people by people and the division of society into exploiters and exploited have been eradicated. The most difficult task of the socialist revolution, the collectivization of agriculture, has been completed, and the collective farm system has taken deep root. The first stage of communist society has been basically established in the country, and the victory of socialism has been legally embodied in the new constitution. By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, socialist industry accounted for 98.7% of the total national production funds, and socialist production had completely controlled the entire national economy, reaching 99.8% of the total industrial production, 98.6% of the total agricultural production, and 100% of the total trade volume. In 1937, workers and staff employed by the socialist economy accounted for 34.7% of the total national population, collective farmers and handicraftsmen united in handicraft cooperatives accounted for 55.5%, and soldiers, students, dependents, and others accounted for an estimated 4.2%. Thus, 94.4% of the national population is directly engaged in the socialist economy or has a close relationship with it. The main and decisive task of the Second Five-Year Plan, the complete technical transformation of the national economy, has been largely resolved. In 1937, more than 80% of the total industrial production came from factories newly built or completely transformed during the First and Second Five-Year Plans. Ninety percent of all tractors and combine harvesters used in agriculture were manufactured domestically during the Second Five-Year Plan period. Industry completed the outline of the Second Five-Year Plan in April 1937, in just four years and three months. The railway transport sector was completed and exceeded within four years. The agricultural sector also exceeded in terms of grain and cotton. Industrial production in 1937 increased by 120% compared to 1932, while the original plan was only 114%. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, average annual industrial production increased by 17.1%, while the plan was 16.5%. Cadres who can grasp new technologies have been trained in all economic sectors. The greatest success is the emergence of important cadres among the Soviet intelligentsia and the bold promotion of new leading workers in all economic departments, whether they are Bolsheviks inside or outside the party. This kind of cadre is essential in all aspects of socialist construction, and the Stakhanovite movement vividly reflects the success of grasping new technologies. During the Second Five-Year Plan, the labor productivity of large-scale industry increased by 82%, while the original plan was only 63%.</p>
<p>The task of raising the material and cultural standards of the working class and increasing the level of consumption more than twofold, as stipulated in this plan, has also been completed. The number of workers and staff in various departments of the national economy increased by 17.6%. The average annual wage of workers and staff increased by 113.5% in 1937 compared to 1932. The state allocated funds for workers' and peasants' culture and material services (education, health, etc.) increasing from 4.4 billion to 14 billion rubles. In the four years from 1933 to 1937, the total income of collective farmers increased by 2.7 times. The production of necessities in 1937 increased more than twofold compared to 1932. The total volume of state and cooperative trade increased more than threefold. Because a cultural revolution actually took place in the country during the plan period, the number of primary and secondary school students increased from 21.6 million to 29.4 million, and the number of university students increased to 550,000. The material and cultural progress of the people of Soviet Central Asia has been rapid. During the Third Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union entered a new stage of development, the construction of a completely classless socialist society, a stage of gradual transition from socialism to communism. In this stage, the communist education of the working people, with the aim of overcoming the remnants of capitalism in the hearts of the builders of communism, has acquired decisive importance.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has already transformed itself into an economically independent country, capable of supplying its own economy and national defense with all necessary technical equipment. The Soviet Union ranks first in the world in terms of industrial development rate, but the inadequacy of the total Soviet industrial production compared with the most advanced capitalist countries in technology and economy must be thoroughly eliminated, so that communism can achieve the final victory in the historical competition with capitalism. We are now able and must take upon ourselves the responsibility of completing the main economic tasks of the Soviet Union, catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in Europe and the United States in the economic field, and thoroughly resolving this issue in the near future. At the same time, during the new plan period, we must promote the increase of national income and trade volume, so that the consumption of the people can be increased by one and a half to two times. Further, in coordination with these main tasks, we must improve the cultural level of all urban and rural working people, and elevate the cultural and technical level of the working class, the most advanced leading force of socialist society, to the level of engineers and technicians.</p>
<p>During the Second Five-Year Plan, industry and the entire national economy have made great progress, and now it is required to grow further and unhindered according to a fixed plan. Under the conditions of the imperialist forces intensifying their aggression and surrounding the Soviet Union, it is necessary to create a large amount of national reserves, first of all regarding the development of fuel, electricity, a part of the national defense industry, and transportation.</p>
<p>In coordination with these tasks, the article proposed the following items: stipulating that in 1942 (the final year of the Third Five-Year Plan), the total industrial production of the Soviet Union should be 1.8 trillion rubles, an increase of 88% compared to 955 billion in 1937, of which the production of means of production should increase by 103%, and the production of consumer goods should increase by 69%. In the same year, the Soviet industry should produce 1.4 million cars, produce 750 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 230 million tons of coal, 54 million tons of oil, 22 million tons of pig iron, 27.5 million tons of steel, 21 million tons of rolled steel, and chemical products worth 13.4 billion rubles. The production of the machinery manufacturing industry should increase by 2.25 times, internal steam turbines by 4.8 times, steam boilers by 4.6 times. The production of coal should be increased, so that it is not only sufficient for domestic needs, but also establishes national reserves. A new oil base "Second Baku" should be established between the Volga and the Ural Mountains. The gasification of various fuels should be developed, especially the underground gasification of coal, making it an independent industry. An artificial liquid fuel industry should be created based on the hydrogenation of hard fuels, first in the east, and gas should be artificially converted into liquid fuel. The total power generation of various power plants should be increased to 2.1 times. The chemical industry should be transformed into one of the main industrial sectors to meet the needs of the national economy and national defense. The Third Five-Year Plan should be a chemical five-year plan, and the production of the chemical industry should increase by 2.3 times. The steel industry should also continue to increase production, so that the plan should also become a five-year plan for special steel. The production of general consumer goods should increase by 1.7 times. The labor productivity of the working industry should increase by 65%, and the production cost should be reduced by 11%.</p>
<p>In agriculture, the total production value should increase from 198 billion rubles in 1937 to 302 billion rubles in 1942, an increase of 53%. At the same time, the average annual grain harvest should increase from 550 million poods during the Second Five-Year Plan to 700 million poods, an increase of 27%. By 1942, the harvest of industrial crops should increase to 39 million quintals of sugar beets, 32.9 million quintals of cotton, and 8.5 million quintals of flax. Among livestock, horses should increase by 35%, cattle by 40%, pigs by 100%, and sheep and goats by 110%. The mechanization of agricultural methods should be thoroughly completed.</p>
<p>In transportation, railway freight should increase from 355 billion ton-kilometers in 1937 to 510 billion ton-kilometers in 1942, river freight from 33 billion ton-kilometers to 58 billion ton-kilometers, and sea freight from 37 billion to 51 billion ton-kilometers. The number of railway locomotives should increase by 7,370, vehicles by 190,000, 11,000 kilometers of new railways should be built, 8,000 kilometers of switches should be laid, and 1,840 kilometers of railways should be electrified. The navigable waterways of inland rivers should be expanded from 101,000 kilometers to 115,000 kilometers. By the end of this plan, the Arctic Ocean route should be turned into a regularly navigable waterway to maintain normal traffic with the Far East. Automobile transportation should increase by 4.6 times, and 210,000 kilometers of highways should be built and renovated.</p>
<p>In terms of talent, the article suggests training 1.4 million various specialized technicians and 600,000 specialized talents with higher education.</p>
<p>During this plan period, the total value of capital construction should be 1.8 trillion rubles (1.15 trillion in the Second Five-Year Plan), of which industry accounts for 1.033 trillion, transportation 358 billion, and agriculture 106 billion. New and renovated factories with a total value of 1.79 trillion rubles should be opened, and the total power generation of various power plants should be increased from 81 billion kilowatts to 172 billion kilowatts. Coal production should be increased by 1.7 times, steel factories to 24 million tons, pig iron to 2.4 times, aluminum to 2.4 times, automobile industry to 2.4 times, and cotton industry to 1.5 times.</p>
<p>The article also stipulates that the capital construction and factory construction in the eastern and far eastern regions should be accelerated in particular, so as to fully develop the metallurgical industry in these regions, establish a large textile industry in the east, use cotton from Central Asia, ensure the further economic and cultural development of the provinces of the national republics, and the large factories to be established in the five-year plan are as follows: several heavy machine tool manufacturing plants, five turbine manufacturing plants, several small automobile manufacturing plants, several new automobile assembly plants and freight automobile plants in Siberia and the Far East, and several spinning and weaving machine manufacturing plants. Start creating the world's largest construction project, the two hydroelectric power plants in Kuibyshev, totaling 3.4 million kilowatts. Start building the Kaluga hydroelectric power plant. Complete the hydroelectric power plants of Uglich, Rybinsk, Cherchik, Kanakiru, Svir (two), Niva (two), Sudomi, etc. Start building three hydroelectric power plants and 91 local thermal power plants. Develop several new coal mines with a total annual output of 150 million tons. Open several new oil refineries with a total capacity of 15 million tons. Several refineries with a total capacity of 4.5 million tons. Complete the construction projects of Magnitogorsk Steel Plant, Novotagil, Petrovsk Chabekari Plant in Heilongjiang, Chaplovan Plant, Azov Steel Plate Plant, Ural and Nikopol Steel Pipe Plant. Start building several new steel plants in South Ural and East Siberia. Build a welded steel pipe plant in Ural, and a steel pipe plant in the central region. Build 20 new pig iron blast furnaces. In terms of non-ferrous industry, complete the Balkhash Copper Smelting Plant and the Central Ural and Buryatia Joint Plants. Start building the Mykagan and Yarmali Copper Smelting Plants, and the Altai Lead-Zinc Smelting Plant. Open the Ural Aluminum Plant, Zhadalasha and Rybinsk Aluminum Plants, South Ural and Northern Nickel Plants. Start building several new aluminum, zinc, tin, nickel, molybdenum, etc. plants. The chemical industry started building several new soda and sulfuric acid plants, 13 artificial rubber plants, 14 tire plants, 7 canvas plants, 46 natural rubber plants, and 2 artificial liquid fuel plants in Moscow and Leningrad. And according to the original plan, further develop and transform, complete the third phase of the Moscow subway, and basically complete the Soviet Palace.</p>
<p>In agriculture, increase the number of machine tractor stations by 1,500 and build several new granaries with a total capacity of more than 10 million tons.</p>
<p>In terms of improving the cultural and material standards of the working people in urban and rural areas, the consumption of the working people should be increased by more than one and a half times. The number of workers and staff should increase by 17% compared to 1937, their average wages should increase by 35%, and total wages should increase by 62%. The state allocates funds for cultural and material service undertakings, that is, social insurance, education, health, children's mother subsidies, etc., which should increase from 30.8 billion in 1937 to 53 billion rubles. The income of collective farmers should also be greatly increased.</p>
<p>In education, universal secondary education should be implemented in cities, and the implementation of universal seven-year education (primary school education) should be completed in rural areas. The number of primary and secondary school students in cities should increase to 12.4 million, and in rural areas to 27.7 million. The number of university students should increase to 650,000. The national health expenditure should increase from 10.3 billion in 1937 to 16.5 billion rubles in 1942. The total volume of national and cooperative trade should increase from 126 billion in 1937 to 206 billion rubles in 1942.</p>
<p>The total national income should increase by 1.8 times in five years.</p>
<p>Finally, the article pointed out that in order to complete the tasks stipulated in the Fifth Year Plan, it is necessary to launch socialist competition and the Stakhanovite movement, resolutely maintain labor discipline, completely liquidate the influence of the Trotskyist and Bukharinite fascist gangs and the counter-revolutionary sabotage activities of foreign capitalists and spies, strengthen Bolshevik vigilance, and stated that the current conditions have made the position of the Soviet intelligentsia increasingly important. They already know how to work and fight in a Bolshevik way, so as to improve the cultural level and communist consciousness of the working people. After the political and economic position of Soviet socialist society has been consolidated, the cadres who have grasped the technology of production have decisive importance. This Soviet cultural force will lead the working masses in a great struggle to win the complete victory of communism. (TASS Dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>Unease in Japan</p>
<h3>Many Professors Dismissed and Forced to Resign from Tokyo Imperial University</h3>
<p>Dr. Kawai's Book Banned from Publication; The Emperor Approves Important Cabinet Resolutions</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A book written by Dr. Kawai, a professor of political economy at the Imperial University, has been banned from publication by the authorities for being deemed disruptive to peace and order. Since the new president, Dr. Hiraga, took office, he has been engaged in purging unstable elements, resulting in the dismissal or resignation of six professors, four assistant professors, one lecturer, and four assistant lecturers in the Department of Political Economy. Only three professors and two assistant professors remain. However, Hiraga, with the help of Minister of Education General Araki, is stubbornly pursuing the purge and will not stop until the existing people are removed. At the same time, he is engaged in appeasing the students, because the students, who had just lost many professors on January 31st when the academic year was about to end, are all very distraught.

<p>(Tokyo) It is heard that the Cabinet held an extraordinary meeting last Thursday, after which a resolution of utmost importance was submitted to the Emperor for approval, but its contents are not yet suitable for announcement. (Reuters Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) During a parliamentary session today, a member of parliament mentioned a news item published in the London Chronicle on January 27th and asked Foreign Minister Arita about the new agreement between Japan and Italy, questioning whether Japan intends to conclude such an agreement, and stating that if such an agreement is under consideration, its meaning would be no less than Italy demanding an agreement that not only opposes the Soviet Union but also resists the United States and Britain. Arita gave a brief answer, saying that the purpose of the Anti-Comintern Pact is purely anti-communist and has no other meaning. (Reuters Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the meeting of Japanese ambassadors and ministers to Europe recently concluded in Paris was intended for the newly appointed Ambassador to Italy, Shiratori, to inform the other ambassadors of news about the Sino-Japanese War. Similar meetings may be held in Berlin and Rome in the future. (Reuters Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When the House of Representatives met this morning to debate the budget bill, it discussed strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, and the special military expenditure for the "China Incident." Seiyukai's Haraguchi advocated strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact between the three countries. Foreign Minister Arita replied that the establishment of the pact was originally intended for the signatory countries to jointly defend against the destructive activities of the Third International and had no other purpose. Various reports were not credible. When the pact was established, the Communist Party was very active in China, and China had opened up many "Soviet areas." At that time, Japan, in view of the need to conclude an anti-communist pact with China, had begun negotiations with the Chiang Kai-shek government, but it ultimately failed. Subsequently, the Third International established close cooperation with the Chiang Kai-shek government, and its destructive activities in Europe, as witnessed in Spain, can serve as clear evidence. Arita refused to disclose the nature of the plan that the Japanese government is currently discussing to curb the Third International from continuing to engage in destructive projects. Next, Finance Minister Ishiwata mentioned the special military expenditure, saying that it is impossible to predict how long this military expenditure for the "China Incident" will continue, but Japan's special military expenditure for the European War had been listed as a special item, starting in 1916 and lasting for ten years. (Reuters Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Japanese officials here recently announced that the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu Aoi, Ambassador to Italy, Shiratori Toshio, Ambassador to Belgium, Kurusu, Minister to the National Government of Spain, Yano, and Minister to Switzerland, Amau, are now gathered here for talks. General Oshima, the Ambassador to Germany, sent a representative due to illness, but this is not called a meeting. According to reliable sources, the nature of this gathering of Japanese diplomats is not entirely the same as the regularly scheduled meetings. It is heard that this time it was initiated by the ambassadors to Germany and Italy to gather various information in order to determine whether the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan has the possibility of expanding its scope. Regarding this level, the views of Japanese envoys to various European countries differ. General Oshima and Shiratori Toshio advocate promoting relations with Germany and Italy, and when necessary, signing a treaty of alliance with them. Other envoys say that a reserved attitude should be adopted towards various European issues. Which faction's view will prevail will depend on how the European situation develops. In addition, the Paris Evening News reported that the meeting of Japanese envoys was intended to draft a military alliance treaty between Germany, Italy, and Japan, and that this treaty could be established in a short period of time. The representative of Ambassador to Italy, Shiratori Toshio, and Ambassador to Germany, General Oshima, told the other envoys at the meeting that the reason why China's resistance is so resolute is due to the support of various democratic countries. For Japan's sake, it is necessary to promote relations with various totalitarian countries in order to strike a blow at various democratic countries. (Havas, 29th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Constructing Fortifications in Wuchang and Yueyang</h3>
<p>Changde According to reports from the front: (1) Because the section of railway from Wuchang to Yueyang is repeatedly destroyed by the Chinese army and cannot be used, the Japanese have recently dispatched troops to be stationed at stations along the line and constructed strong fortifications to defend them. It is estimated that Xianning currently has 500-600 Japanese infantry, over 100 cavalry, and 4 artillery pieces. Tingsiqiao has over 100 Japanese soldiers, Puqi has over 400 Japanese mules and horses, 4 artillery pieces, and a small squad of engineers.

<h3>Ji'an Suffers Tragic Bombing by Japanese Aircraft: Nearly 100 Dead and Wounded, Dozens of Houses Destroyed</h3>
<p>Ji'an Correspondence: At 10:17 AM on the 11th of this month, the Air Defense Command received a report that 18 Japanese aircraft were flying south from Qingjiang and Zhangshu. The command immediately issued an air raid alert, followed by an emergency alert, and ordered all garrison troops to mobilize and maintain strict vigilance. By 11:13 AM, 9 Japanese aircraft were circling several times over the urban area and dropped over 100 bombs in the vicinity of Taiping Bridge in the suburbs and the Longyang Pavilion area of Shanghe Street, including many incendiary bombs. Dozens of civilian houses were destroyed and burned, and nearly 100 civilians were killed and wounded. This was truly an unprecedented catastrophe for Ji'an. After wreaking havoc, the Japanese aircraft fled northwest. The alert was lifted around 12:00 PM. After the incident, an investigation revealed that the Japanese aircraft dropped a total of 188 bombs, 169 of which landed in the suburbs and 19 within the urban area. The locations in the city included 2 at the Huoshen Temple, 3 at Daxingkou, 2 at Houshanghe Street, 3 at Longyang Pavilion, 1 at Zhongshan Pier, 2 under Tianhou Palace by the river, 1 at Rongshu Pier, 1 at Xiahe Street, 3 at Shang Yongshu Road, and 1 at Zhanqian Pier. Moreover, incendiary bombs landed at Longyang Pavilion, burning more than a dozen shops. A total of 43 civilian houses were destroyed elsewhere, along with 7 civilian boats and 1 steamer. 28 citizens died (18 men and 10 women), and 78 were injured. However, there were also many women washing clothes along the river and workers on boats who were bombed into the river. Since the bodies have not surfaced, it is impossible to count them, so the actual number of deaths and injuries is not limited to this.</p>
<p>When Longyang Pavilion was hit and caught fire, the fire brigade rushed to the scene amidst the air raid sirens to put out the fire. The Air Defense Command also ordered officers and soldiers from various teams to assist. Afterwards, Commander Yang Tingya personally led Chief of Staff Chen Zhentang, County Magistrate Hu Yunhong, Police Chief Yang Zhenchang, Chamber of Commerce Chairman Xiao Zongchuan, and others to the bombed sites to supervise firefighting, rescue, and security. As a result, order was restored immediately, but post-disaster work urgently needed to be carried out. Therefore, County Magistrate Hu ordered the police bureau to quickly clear the fire site and rescue the victims, and also sent personnel to the Provincial Hospital and the Catholic Hospital to register the number of injured and handle the burial of the dead.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Chaoshan Areas, Japanese Soldiers Attempt to Land but Fail</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The number of Japanese warships outside Mayu Estuary off Shantou suddenly increased starting on the 18th. Two Japanese gunboats were also anchored in the north and south ports of Chenghai. Three giant Japanese warships were anchored near Nan'ao. Recently, three giant Japanese warships have appeared again on the sea off Chaoyang and Huilai. On the 18th, sailors took motorboats to Nan'ao and landed in two groups. One group entered Houzhai Long'ao, setting fire to the public education center (i.e., the county government administrative office). The other group climbed the mountain to search for guerrilla forces, looting 150 bags of relief rice, burning more than 20 civilian houses, and harassing the area for four hours before leaving. At 8:00 AM on the 19th, the Japanese patrol ship Yubari commanded four destroyers to shell the areas along the coast of Shenquan and Jinghai in Huilai, and Hedutou and Dahao in Chaoyang, and Nangang and Yanzao in Chenghai. The shells landed in the wilderness outside the villages. At night, they used lights to illuminate the coastline, attempting to land under cover of darkness. The ships dispatched three aircraft to drop three bombs on the Haifeng Shanwei Provincial Aquatic Products School, and flew low for fifteen minutes, strafing residents. Seven civilian houses were destroyed, and six people were killed or injured. At 8:00 AM on the 21st, Japanese aircraft again flew to the Shantou Railway Station of the Chaoshan Railway for a fierce attack. Passengers scattered and fled in a panic. The aircraft flew to Chao'an Xiangzi Bridge and dropped bombs, attempting to bomb the Xiangzi Bridge, but the two bombs landed on cargo ships under the bridge, destroying five civilian boats and killing or injuring seven or eight boatmen, with a loss of over 10,000 yuan in cargo. The aircraft then flew to Jieyang and dropped bombs at the Fengjie Station, shooting at pedestrians. Afterwards, it flew over Puning, Huilai, and Lufeng, wreaking havoc everywhere. Scoundrels spread various rumors, causing panic. The newly appointed Mayor of Shantou, Wu Qi, came from Shaoguan to Shantou to maintain order. The commander of the Ninth Guerrilla District, Liu Zhilu, went to Shao for official business. Deputy Commander Chen Shumu led troops to Chenghai Waisha to defend the front line. The commander of the Eighth Guerrilla District, Weng Zhaoyuan, also personally went to Haimen in Chaoyang to prepare for battle. At present, foreign ships are still entering and leaving the port as usual, but all sailboats and fishing boats have stopped going to sea. Traffic between Nan'ao and Chaoshan has therefore been cut off again. It is said that Japanese warships are deliberately creating a diversion on the Fujian border, claiming to attack Chaozhou and Meizhou, in order to contain the units of the East River Chinese army counterattacking Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Shipping Ningbo Local Goods for Export</h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce only cares about the livelihood of workers and farmers and ignores the national war of resistance laws.</p>
<p>Ningbo Correspondence: After the Zhejiang Customs was ordered to designate 55 kinds of goods such as cotton as prohibited from being transported to Japan and its colonies, entrusted ruling areas, and areas occupied by violence, the citizens of various industries in Ningbo have been requesting relief. Chairman Zhou of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce also said that cotton, cotton yarn, tea, paper, and other goods banned for export are the main local products of eastern Zhejiang, which are deeply and significantly related to the rural economy and local finance. Once exports are banned, millions of workers and farmers in eastern Zhejiang will lose their livelihoods. Moreover, the end of the commercial settlement period is approaching. The value of these local products is estimated to be over 20 million yuan. If they cannot be shipped for export before the end of the settlement period, the local finances will immediately collapse. After requesting the Zhejiang Customs Commissioner An Naidi to forward the request to Commissioner-General Mei, he also telegraphed the two ministers of finance and economy, asking them to quickly send a telegram to the Zhejiang Customs to allow local goods such as cotton, tea, and eggs to be exported. Yesterday, he also visited Jin Handing, the director of the First Inspection Team of the Military Discipline of the War Zone of the Military Affairs Commission, who had arrived in Ningbo, and explained everything in detail. Jin agreed to telegraph Chairman Chiang and ask him to order the two ministries of finance and economy to order the Zhejiang Customs to allow the export of local goods such as cotton to maintain livelihoods and strengthen finance.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Guangdong Desperately Seek to Advance Westward: Repeated Bombings of Sanshui, Gaoming, Qinzhou, and Lianzhou; Japanese Warships Move to Xuwen</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The war in Guangdong Province, with the Japanese army focusing on the Xijiang southern route, has gradually been confirmed. Therefore, most of the reinforcements recently sent by the Japanese army from Taiwan to Guangzhou have gone directly to Sanshui and along the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway to Jiujiang, strengthening defensive fortifications in various places southwest of Sanshui to facilitate the advancement of troops. It is estimated that Sanshui has increased to more than 5,000 people in recent days, and the Jiujiang area has about 4,000 people. However, the Japanese army is suffering from attacks behind their lines, so even after increasing troops, they still dare not launch a large-scale westward offensive. Guerrilla forces near Lubao in Sanshui have been extremely active recently, and the Japanese troops stationed there are constantly constrained. The Japanese army, angered by the villagers, dispatched a small mortar team to Genya Village in Nanbian Township, Lubao on the 20th of the month, and carried out large-scale burning and looting. More than 60 shops in Nanbian Township were burned. At the same time, Japanese aircraft flew to Genya Village and dropped bombs, destroying more than 50 houses and killing 60-70 villagers. As for the Japanese troops acting rashly in Sanshui, they once used fir rafts to cross the river and attacked Jinli and old Sanshui. The Chinese army calmly fought back, waiting for the Japanese troops to cross halfway before opening fire. As a result, hundreds of Japanese soldiers were killed, some drowned in the river, and they retreated in a state of great disarray after more than an hour. The Japanese army, unable to carry out their plan to cross the river, sent twelve aircraft on the morning of the 20th to fly to Gaoming County seat in front of Jiujiang and Qianqian, dropping more than forty bombs, destroying more than thirty houses and killing or injuring more than forty people. Before the Japanese infantry advance, they must first send aircraft to bomb the rear of the Chinese army, which is their only common tactic. According to current observations, the total number of Japanese soldiers in Sanshui and Jiujiang is only more than 10,000. At a minimum, the Japanese army must leave half of its forces to defend the area, and the other half to advance. The Japanese troops defending the two places must also be responsible for defending against guerrillas. Therefore, the maximum number of troops that can be advanced from Sanshui and Jiujiang is only six or seven thousand. It is not easy to use this force to try to spy on Zhaoqing and Sihui and invade Guangxi Province. At present, the Xijiang Chinese army is temporarily taking a defensive posture, judging whether the main force of the Japanese army will advance westward or attack southward, and then launch a fierce counterattack, so that the Japanese army cannot take care of both ends and can be defeated individually.</p>
<p>The Japanese army is increasing its troops on the southern route, using Weizhou Island as a base, trying to land in Beihai, to raid Nanning in Guangxi Province, and go to Longzhou to cut off the Sino-Vietnamese international transportation line. This has been planned for a long time and has recently become more active. It is said that Japanese warships have repeatedly shelled the Beihai defense forces. On the 24th, the Chinese army also returned fire. The Japanese army was finally unable to land. It is said that the Chinese army has superior fortifications in the Beihai area, and the Guangdong-Guangxi joint defense has strong forces. The self-defense teams in Hepu, Lingshan, Qinxian, and Fangcheng in Guangdong Province have also increased by five large teams, and the local armed forces are also very strong. As for the sea area around Hainan, Japanese warships are now moving erratically. Nine Japanese warships were found near Qiong Island and then sailed away. In addition to the original Japanese warships, three more Japanese warships have been added to Weizhou Island. Eight Japanese warships have also arrived in the Xuwen sea area of the Leizhou Peninsula, most of which are cruisers and destroyers. The Japanese warships have recently dared not gather all the ships in the Qinzhou and Lianzhou sea area, because the French fleet has concentrated in Vietnam to defend Guangzhou Bay, fearing friction with it, so most of them are docked in Xuwen. As for Weizhou Island, although the area is not large, more than a thousand Japanese soldiers have been stationed there in recent days. Most of the local residents have fled to Beihai, and their situation is extremely miserable. Those who have not escaped are forced by the Japanese army to build trenches and bunkers. As for the women, almost all of them have fled.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Stipulates Measures for the Preservation of Documents: Government Assists with Relocation</h3>
<p>Jinhua Correspondence: The Zhejiang Provincial Wartime Education and Culture Committee, in view of the fact that since the War of Resistance, many public and private collections of books have been lost, including many books related to national culture, academic inventions, and other issues, proposed to the Provincial Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Association to establish the Zhejiang Provincial Collection Committee for Documents of Refugees in the Occupied Areas, as Zhejiang is an important cultural center in the southeast, and the collection and preservation of this type of document is especially important. The Provincial Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Association discussed this issue at its sixth meeting and decided on five points:</p>
<p>The committee does not need to be established.</p>
<p>Issue a notice to all counties to pay close attention to all kinds of historically valuable documents.</p>
<p>If it is inconvenient for private individuals to preserve documents, they can be handed over to the local or provincial library for safekeeping.</p>
<p>In the event of an incident, the government should assist in the relocation of documents held by private individuals.</p>
<p>If the Education and Culture Affairs Committee, after investigation, confirms that there are various valuable documents related to history and culture, it can report to the Association and forward it to the Provincial Government for verification.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Annihilates 300 Japanese Soldiers at the Border of Jiaxing and Haiyan</h3>
<p>Jiaxing Correspondence: On the 26th, six Japanese motorboats suddenly passed through a certain Chinese army base at the border of Jiaxing and Haiyan, carrying more than 300 Japanese soldiers. The Chinese army and soldiers immediately relied on the terrain on both sides to concentrate their firepower and bombard the Japanese boats. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Japanese soldiers stubbornly resisted while desperately opening the throttles to escape. However, due to the Chinese army and soldiers giving their lives, no Japanese soldier survived in this battle. The Japanese army occupying Jiaxing, because the "January 28th" anniversary was approaching again, and there were widespread rumors that the Chinese army would be active on that day, the Japanese headquarters ordered the soldiers stationed in Jiaxing not to go out without reason, and set up sandbags and barbed wire at various key points, prohibiting the passage of vehicles and horses. Inland river ships were also suspended on that day.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Invade Punan, Burning and Killing Terribly</h3>
<p>Punan Correspondence: The Japanese army has repeatedly attacked Punan, but they have failed. This time, they have invaded in large numbers, coming from three routes: Minhang, Songjiang, and Pinghu, forming an encirclement on the 25th of this month. The advance units crossed the Huangpu River from Zhujiahang, Huan'an, and other towns on the border of Songjiang and Fengxian counties to search, knocking on doors house by house, and no one was spared. The Punan Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army had received news early on. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, they disintegrated into smaller units and used mobile warfare to deal with them. On the morning of the 26th, guided by local people, the Japanese army invaded Ruanxiang Town on the border of Songjiang and Fengxian counties, first strafing with machine guns. There were about 200 people, guarding all sides. The townspeople were unable to escape. The National Salvation Army, ambushing outside the town, saw this situation and immediately launched attacks from all sides. The Japanese army retreated in disarray, and the townspeople were able to take the opportunity to escape. The Japanese army then mobilized three units and rushed into the town with machine guns, conducting a large-scale search. It is said that more than 20 men, women, and children who failed to escape were killed. The most tragic case was the Xia family dyeing workshop, where the father, son, and daughter, unable to abandon their family business, hid in the attic. The Japanese army considered them to be a special operations team and tied them up on the spot, poured kerosene on them, and threw them into a woodpile. The flames spread, turning neighboring houses into ruins. It is estimated that more than 30 shops in the market were destroyed. The Japanese army went to Zhuangjiahang Town overnight. Before the townspeople got up in the morning, they used machine guns to attack the town, forcing men, women, and children to stand on the street in rows of two, interrogating them one by one. They then went to Zhu Liangsheng's house and stabbed Zhu Liangsheng's ten-year-old son to death on the spot. Zhu Liangsheng and his eldest son and three others were tied up by the Japanese and dragged out, and thick lead wires were inserted into their bones, making them appear extremely cruel. Before leaving, they set Zhu's house and the neighboring Han's house on fire. The reason why most of the market houses in the town were preserved this time was that after the Japanese army set the fire, the townspeople desperately tried to put it out, thus preventing the fire from spreading. As a result, only dozens of interconnected rooms of the Zhu and Han families in Henan were destroyed. The Japanese army withdrew from Nanqiao on the 26th.</p>

<h3>Finance: Spot Price Rarely Changes, Fluctuating Between 2020 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold dark market saw little fluctuation, hovering around the closing price of last Saturday. However, the range for the whole day was only two yuan, as the public was awaiting speeches from Chamberlain and Hitler, so they were temporarily adopting a wait-and-see attitude and were unwilling to enter or exit lightly. Although the northern merchants sold off slightly midway, the jewelry merchants did not dump much, so under the purchasing power of the money exchange and securities merchants, the price remained stable. Luk Chuk fell by one yuan, and trading also decreased slightly, with only about 600 taels traded. General sentiment was slightly better than last weekend. Gold jewelry, customs gold, and Sino-British pure gold were all unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Only Dropped by One Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial asking price was 2,033 yuan per bar (ten taels), but no deals were made. It wasn't until 9:45 AM that a money exchange, on behalf of a fellow merchant, bought 50 taels of spot gold, and the northern merchants bought 50 taels, at an opening price of 2,020 yuan. Subsequently, the jewelry merchants bought 50 taels from the money exchange, at the same price. In the meantime, news suddenly broke that foreign exchange had weakened slightly after being dumped by Hong Kong Electric and Sassoon, so the price also fell immediately. A money exchange bought 50 taels each from the jewelry merchants and spot gold merchants, both at 18 yuan. At that time, securities and jewelry merchants suddenly came in to buy, so the price rebounded immediately. The securities merchants also bought 50 taels each from the gold and northern merchants at the same price. The jewelry merchants bought 50 taels from a fellow merchant, priced at 20 yuan. Money exchangers traded 50 taels with each other, priced at 19 yuan and 5 jiao. Finally, a gold merchant sold 50 taels to a money exchange, priced at 19 yuan, which was the noon closing price. The afternoon was still uneventful, and trading was sparse. It wasn't until 2:40 PM that money exchangers were seen trading 50 taels with each other, priced at 19 yuan. Subsequently, a gold merchant bought 50 taels from a money exchange, priced at 19 yuan and 5 jiao. After that, because foreign exchange was said to have gradually recovered after being snapped up by foreign firms, buyers were slightly more active. At 3:45 PM, money exchangers were seen trading 30 taels with each other, priced at 20 yuan. At that time, there were still people bidding 20 yuan to buy, but sellers were unwilling to supply, so no deals were made. The evening closing price was 2,020 yuan, a drop of one yuan compared to the previous day. The current selling price of the current number's gold was 2,030 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,015 yuan. The current standard gold was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and no deals were made.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate for Gold Jewelry Unchanged</p>
<p>The exchange rate for gold jewelry remained unchanged, with Da Tong Heng, Lao Qingyun, and others still listing the original price of 205 yuan per tael, and Xin Tong Heng listing 203 yuan, with a purchase price of 197 yuan.</p>
<p>Customs Pure Gold Also Unchanged</p>
<p>The Central Bank's purchase price for Chinese spot gold remained unchanged at 1,214 yuan. The listed customs gold also remained unchanged at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 9 li. Shanghai Standard Gold also remained unchanged at 1,209 yuan, 3 jiao, as a result of London's telegram on the 28th, which stated that British pure gold remained fixed at £7, 8 shillings, and 8.5 pence per ounce.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Reselling Quite Active, Guangzhou Merchants and Money Exchangers Also Start Selling Hong Kong Exchange</h3>
<p>The exchange market yesterday was slightly stronger because although foreign firms were buying, banks were more willing to supply, and Hong Kong Electric, Sassoon, and the cotton yarn merchants were all selling. However, there was still little change midway, and transactions were very light. Hong Kong exchange also loosened slightly because money exchangers and Guangzhou merchants were selling heavily.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London large bills, both near and far, were seen rebounding. The New York silver price remained unchanged. The London gold price also remained unchanged. The exchange rate of British currency to the US dollar was up 1.2 li, to the French franc was up 4 centimes, and to Shanghai was flat. The exchange rate of the US dollar to British currency was up 375, to the French franc was up 125, and to Shanghai was down 2 fen. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Banks opened with a spot selling price of British exchange at 8 shillings, 3 pence, 4 fen, 3 li, and 7 hao, and US exchange at 16.25 yuan, both the same as last Saturday's noon closing price. After opening, foreign firms bought British gold at 8 shillings, 3 pence, 4 fen, 3 li, and 7 hao, and US exchange at 16.28125 yuan. However, because banks were still willing to supply, the situation lacked change. The HSBC listing was revealed as before. The silver balancing tax was revealed to be up 1.5 fen. After that, Hong Kong Electric and the British merchant Sassoon sold British gold at 8 shillings, 3 pence, 5 fen, 9 li, 3 hao, and 7 si, and US exchange at 16.28125 yuan. Most of it was bought by Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, and American Express. In addition, money exchangers also followed suit and sold Hong Kong exchange at 56.125 yuan. Moreover, it was difficult for foreign banks to buy, so the process gradually loosened. The noon closing selling price of banks was slightly looser than the morning opening price, with British gold at 8 shillings, 3 pence, 5 fen, 9 li, 3 hao, and 7 si, and US exchange at 16.28125 yuan.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the cotton yarn merchants dumped US exchange at 16.3125 yuan, while foreign firms bought British gold at 8 shillings, 3 pence, 4 fen, 3 li, and 7 hao. Foreign banks also engaged in both buying and selling, so the situation remained unchanged. Later, although Guangzhou merchants sold Hong Kong exchange at 55.875 yuan, Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, American Express, and others were still eagerly buying, so the underlying trend tightened slightly. By the evening closing, the selling price of banks was British exchange at 8 shillings, 3 pence, 5 fen, 9 li, 3 hao, and 7 si, and US exchange at 16.28125 yuan, the same as the noon closing price. As a result, British currency was 0.015625 harder and US currency was 0.03125 cheaper than last Saturday. Hong Kong exchange was also up 25. The following is a record of the transactions made during the day: British Exchange (Calculated at 1 Yuan National Currency), US Exchange (Calculated at 100 Yuan National Currency), Hong Kong Exchange (Calculated at 100 Yuan National Currency)</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Stops Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for bank drafts stopped rising and retreated slightly. The rate per 1,000 yuan was still generally fluctuating between 36 yuan, 2 jiao, and 5 fen, and 37 yuan. At noon, it was 36 yuan and 5 jiao. In the afternoon, it was 36 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen, 2 jiao and 5 fen lower than last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Trends Stabilize</h3>
<p>Last Saturday, British pure gold was unchanged, and the British-US exchange rate rose by 1.25. Yesterday, the foreign exchange market had a balanced supply and demand, and the trend was stable. Spot gold trading was still strong, and the market price fluctuated narrowly, showing a hovering trend. Foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds and gold notes, were traded slightly, and the market price fluctuated slightly, but most were unchanged. Guild transactions were rare. Only Chang Tai sold Heng Mao 50 pounds of British gold notes. Yesterday's market price: British gold pounds fell by 5 fen, British gold notes rose by 2 fen, US gold pounds rose by 1 jiao, US gold notes fell by 2 li, Hong Kong notes fell by 1 li, Italian gold notes fell by 5 li, and all other currencies were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Securities Public Bond Market Conditions Suddenly Difficult to Recover Northern Sales Impact</h3>
<p>Securities in the after-hours market: Yesterday's market conditions, after a two-day market suspension, were more active. The trend was still unable to rise under high pressure. The outflow of spot goods from the sellers continued to come from various sources. In addition to the continued selling of Tenth Number, Tongkang Number and Dafeng Number also tended to sell. As a result, rumors arose in the market. Although they were groundless and fabricated out of thin air, the extremely fragile sentiment could no longer withstand another attack. Some said that there would be new reforms in interest rates in the future, and some said that the number of winning tickets in the subsequent lottery would be reduced. Such absurd talk was based on the fact that the seventh lottery would increase the number of tickets for the five types of unified public bonds in accordance with the original plan, especially Type A. In fact, those in North China who held these public bonds did have difficulties. Legal tender could not circulate smoothly, and there was the unexpected misfortune of price suppression. Therefore, a large number of spot goods arrived in Shanghai for sale. In addition, the selling of Tenth Number had not stopped for several days, so the several rises were eventually suppressed and fell. Starting today, the market price should be calculated by deducting 3 yuan in interest, and there is a proposal to issue 500 million new public bonds. The future may be difficult to recover the depressed sentiment for the time being. Yesterday, at the beginning of the morning, retail investors seemed to have an appetite, and the market price slowly strengthened. In the middle, Tenth Number, Thirty-first Number, and Tongkang Number suddenly surged, and the market price fell in a straight line. At the close, Lemao and Changtai Number bought in, and it recovered slightly, but it had already fallen by 78 cents to more than 1 yuan. In the afternoon, trading was thinner, and the trend was still good first and then small. At first, Xie Da bought in and the market sentiment was very strong, followed by Qiafeng Number, Hengde Number, and Lianhe Number selling one after another, and then it went downstream, a few cents smaller than in the morning. As a result, the decline continued across the board, ranging from 9 cents to 1 yuan and 7 cents. The total transaction volume was about 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock market conditions: Recently, due to more buyers, trading has been more active. Jiangnan Paper Company stocks with a face value of 20 yuan, which had not been inquired about for a long time, were traded for 500 to 600 shares at a price of 2 yuan and 35 cents. Zhabei Water and Electricity shares were traded for 50 shares at a price of 6 yuan and 50 cents, it is said.</p>
<p>Bituminous coal lumps and fines: High-quality goods are still in demand exceeding supply. Various factories are more eager to store them due to the end of the lunar year. The market has secretly shown a strong trend, and the price is slowly rising. Yesterday, a certain company opened up hundreds of tons of Australian coal, calculated at 42 yuan per ton for screened lumps, 40 yuan for run-of-mine coal, and 41 yuan for fines, delivered from the warehouse, with additional handling fees. However, the inventory is not much and will soon be sold out, it is said.</p>
<p>Economic Data</p>
<h3>Golden World</h3>
<p>Since the world's military buildup and active preparations for war, gold has been the unanimous target of government officials and civilians in various countries. Although gold cannot satisfy hunger or keep out the cold, currency scholars generally believe that its monetary status will eventually be demoted. However, in the current capitalist world, the qualification of "money is omnipotent" has not disappeared, so national governments hoard it to maintain their foreign exchange and clear the price of imported munitions. People are afraid that paper money will depreciate during wartime, so they hoard it to preserve their wealth. Therefore, although the gold reserves used for currency in various countries have increased sharply in recent years, they have not increased as quickly as the world's gold production. For example, the world's gold production has increased by an average of 1,100 metric tons per year in recent years; from 1933 to 1938, it should have increased by as much as 6,600 metric tons. However, the gold used for currency held by various countries in the same period increased by only 4,000 metric tons. It can be seen that the amount of gold hoarded by the public in the past six years has increased by another 2,600 metric tons.</p>
<p>According to the latest issue of the FedcralReserve Bulletin magazine: At the end of 1933, the total value of gold used for world currency was 13,826 million old US dollars; it has increased sharply year by year since then; by the end of September last year, it had increased to 21,367 million old US dollars. However, Japan has sharply reduced from 212 million old US dollars to 97 million old US dollars (this number is still based on Japanese official statistics, and it has actually entered the era of no reserves); while China has increased from 5 million old US dollars to 9 million old US dollars (this number should not include other gold reserves). It is worth noting that Japan's currency gold reserves were 273 million old US dollars at the end of 1936, reduced to 154 million at the end of 1937, and further reduced to 97 million old US dollars in September 1938. In other words, in the first nine months of last year, it sharply reduced by 57 million old US dollars. Since the outbreak of the August 13 war last autumn, Japan has repeatedly exported its domestic gold reserves, and even revalued its reserve prices to facilitate exports. Now it is even openly exporting part of its last gold reserves. However, in the same period, the gold reserves held by the Chinese government increased from 5 million old US dollars to 9 million old US dollars, and remained unchanged until the end of September last year. In contrast, Japan's weakness is obvious. Moreover, according to recent estimates from various parties, China's domestic silver reserves, even at present, still amount to 900 million to 1 billion yuan. This is not included in the above number. The estimated numbers of the magazine are listed below. (Unit: million old US dollars X is an approximate calculation)</p>

<h3>Yarn Flowers Under the Huge Sales of Shenxin, Cotton Yarn Bulls are Disheartened, Each Brand Falls by Six, Seven, or Eight Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been hovering around the peak of 400 yuan for a week, suddenly declined yesterday. The real reason is that the spot yarn sales market is lacking, not as prosperous as it was a few days ago. In the past, the financial circles were relaxed, and there was no transaction to be done at present, so they had a lot of activity in cotton cloth and cotton yarn, and they were very interested in it. Therefore, they searched endlessly in the market. With this impetus, the market rose. Unexpectedly, the actual demand, except for a slight need in the South, other regions were not interested. In addition, Shenxin Factory wholesale opened 5,000 packages, the price was 395 yuan, and the delivery was in February and March. Banks accounted for one-third of the orders, and the rest were taken by counterparts and customers. Although the general opinion is that the opening price is too high, calculated based on the cost of raw materials, the factory's profit is still 60 to 70 yuan per piece. However, with such a large amount of chips to remedy in the market, the bulls were disheartened and closed their positions, and the market suddenly became tired. However, a certain bank still came to eat in small amounts.</p>
<p>Checking the situation of spot yarn in the early morning, the opening price of the customer was not strong, only the Shantou region came to inquire. The market said that the factory had opened a large number of futures. The views of the bulls and bears differed. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma was 2 yuan lower than the previous day, at 398 yuan. The counterpart entered 5 packages. After a while, a crowd of retail sellers gathered, and the market opened and went down. Finally, the price of Shuangma was 394.5 yuan, and the price of stack list was 393 yuan. As a result, the statistics of transactions in the morning were 1,115 packages, and the afternoon transactions on the previous day were 725 packages. The price of 20-count Shuangma was 6 yuan lower than the previous day, Shuangdiqiu was 8 yuan lower, Tejinyu was 6 yuan lower, Tiannv was 6.5 yuan lower, and Baifeiting was 7 yuan lower. Also, today, 60 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Yantai, 30 pieces to Tianjin, 610 pieces to Shantou, and 200 pieces to Hong Kong. The amount of each region purchased is listed on the left: 790 for counterparts, 30 for Wenzhou, 295 for Shantou, and the total is 215.</p>
<p>Previous Day's Transactions</p>
<p>Shantou 40 Hong Kong 240 Tianjin 30 Counterparts 300 Sichuan 75 Total 725 Total transactions for two days 1,840 packages</p>
<p>The yarn market in Japan is extremely short-squeezed, so the market price is very strong. The spot yarn price of 20-count Shuiyue is 335 yuan, and the spot yarn price of 20-count Lanfeng is 328 yuan. Futures prices are still able to be transacted, with the squeeze not yet subsided. The amount of transactions in January Piqiu is said to have been mediated by a broker, and the storm is expected to pass peacefully without any problems.</p>
<p>Shenxin Buys Foreign Cotton Every Day</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The US spot cotton market is extremely narrow, but spot cotton transactions are still good. Most of the bulls are swapping distant months. Only a portion of the shorts are temporarily waiting to see what happens because the government has not yet announced the legislation on the cotton industry and the sale of loan cotton. Yesterday, US cotton rose by 2 pounds, India's forecast rose by half a rupee, and Egypt rose by more than 14 pounds. Yesterday, the exchange rate was firmer, and the cotton prices all rose when converted into legal tender. US cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 20 cents per picul, Indian cotton rose by more than 10 cents, and Egyptian cotton rose by 50 cents.</p>
<p>The local foreign cotton market was quieter yesterday due to the decline in yarn prices. Indian cotton sold the most, because coarse yarn has been selling well recently. Shenxin has been trading in foreign cotton almost every day. Yesterday, it also entered 200 packages of Indian cotton, and Tongyi also entered 500 packages of Indian cotton. The transaction amount and price of yesterday are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Transaction Amount</p>
<h3>Lighter Flower Selling Price Not Loose, Still Opens at 70 Yuan Exchange</h3>
<p>The local cotton business is flat and uninspired, but the market is as stable as ever. The factory has a slight appetite, but large transactions are extremely lacking. Tongyi Factory entered 1,000 packages of lighter flower, and the price is still expensive at 70 yuan. Shenxin Factory entered 400 pieces of Tianjin fine velvet, and the other factories did nothing. The flower companies feel lonely for buying and selling because the lunar New Year is approaching, and they are preparing to close the procedure. However, various factories are still actively purchasing foreign cotton. It is said that Langong cotton, which is equivalent to lighter flower, is priced at only 61.5 yuan, which is much cheaper. The arrival of goods from Subei is still considerable. A total of 5,198 packages of Tonghua arrived on the 28th, 29th, and 30th. 327 packages of Changyinsha flower also arrived. Also, 190 pieces came from Xiaoligang, and 510 pieces came from Beisha. Today, 100 pieces will be exported to Hong Kong. The opening price and transaction amount of spot cotton are listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Eastern White Goods Rise Without End</h3>
<p>A Certain Big Company Clears Piqiu Transactions, Stalled National Cloth, The Rising Wind is Also Sharp, This Street Handles Spring and Summer Goods</p>
<p>National cloth has risen unanimously. Yingchang Factory's various grades of coarse cloth and fine twill have risen by 10 cents per piece. Lunghang Factory's printed satin, floral cloth, serge, tribute satin, and tribute damask have risen by 10 cents. Blue cloth has risen by 20 cents. Huachang Factory's coarse cloth has risen by 10 cents. Fine cloth and fine twill have risen by 12 cents. The prices of colored cloth, printed cloth, and bleached cloth have all risen by 10 to 30 cents. Shenxin Factory opened Fuguifei cloth for March at a price of 12.5 yuan and Fuguifei twill at a price of 11.75 yuan. The total amount is about 500 pieces. Yong'an Dapeng fine cloth is priced at 12.75 yuan and was purchased for more than 20 pieces of spot goods by the Guangdong region. The Shantou and Hong Kong regions added 50 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, Chunniu, Aizi, and other brands. More than 80 boxes of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and bleached twill. The Wenzhou and Ningbo regions added more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth, 84 cloth, fine twill, and fine cloth from factories such as Yihe and Neiyi. More than 190 boxes of blue cloth, factory cloth, colored twill, and printed cloth. The wholesale shops in this street also have a healthy appetite. Lunghang, Central, and Hengfeng printed cloth, blue cloth, Guangxie, woolen cloth, and serge from various factories have been traded for nearly 200 boxes. They are also very careful to search for and purchase various stocks of spring and summer sales products such as foreign yarn, poplin, and ramie yarn. The transaction amount is huge. The Tianjin region in the north purchased 60 to 70 boxes of Tiao Su Fu silk, blue cloth, and woolen cloth. The Yantai region purchased nearly 100 boxes of yarn, serge, colored twill, and Li cloth. The Sichuan-Yunnan region and overseas Siam and Singapore are also constantly purchasing goods.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth white goods are rising in a straight line without end. The bidding for fine cloth and fine twill was inconsistent and chaotic yesterday morning. The market situation has changed greatly. It turns out that a certain big company has been buying long and selling short at ordinary times, and the amount is very large. Now it cannot be compensated and should be cleared. Dozens of counterparts have been indirectly and directly implicated. This has caused the leather ball business in the market to stop invisibly. The spot goods transactions outside the market and the purchase by dyeing factories in this street are only about 1,000 pieces, but the futures orders are very large, and the price is rising step by step. The market price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth in the morning was 12.25 yuan per piece, and 12.35 yuan in the afternoon. The opening price of Rainbow Ball was 12.3 to 4 yuan. Feiyu 11 to 12 yuan, 1 to 3.5 to 50 cents. Five Blessings 12.15 yuan. Trumpet 11.9 to 12 yuan Blue Shuangyu 11.85 to 95 cents. Various foreign firms have ordered more than 2,000 pieces of fine cloth for February, March, and April. The Tianjin region accounts for half of them, and the rest are opened by counterparts. Fine twill is quoted even higher, but it has not been opened. The selling price of spot goods is 25 cents higher per piece than on Saturday, and the fine twill is 25 to 30 cents higher. The hoarders have a strong intention, and the trend is quite tight. On Saturday, the Tianjin region bulked 100 boxes of Four Gentlemen Serge at a price of 39.25 cents per yard.</p>
<p>Today, 140 pieces of piece goods will be exported to Yantai, 50 pieces to Beihai, 150 pieces to Shantou, and 10 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea Silk Path Alone is Good</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was no market in New York, and the rise and fall in Yokohama were minimal, but generally firm. The spot price was 880 yuan, down 3 yuan, and the forward price was 866 yuan, up 1 yuan. Locally, the foreign firms are still lifeless, but the users are as enthusiastic as before. White factory ordinary B word 10-22 strips, silk factory demand is very strong, the silk price has risen to 1440 yuan, the general sentiment is to hope to 1500 yuan, recently the foreign firms into the stomach and the user market price, has been more than 80 yuan apart, the three ports of England, France and the United States silk delivery, the forecast in the coming weeks, or will still be difficult to expand, yesterday the Indian foreign firms into the reeling meridian ten loads, the price of 690 yuan, compared to a week ago has risen 20 yuan, the user to do 40 loads, the market is very brisk said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Green Tea Needs Are Very Strong</h3>
<p>Rough Tea Prices Soar, Costs Are Huge</p>
<p>The local foreign tea market has seen very little trading in the past week, but foreign firms are in great need of high-end goods, so they are buying at high prices. However, the market's stock is scarce, and the supply is not enough to meet the demand. In the past week, only more than 300 boxes of high-end Zhenmei were traded, and the market was quite stable. The other low-end varieties were difficult to choose, resulting in a market without a price. It is heard that the local tea factories Yuanli, Sanyuan Yichengxiang, Dachan, etc., have successively transported large amounts of rough tea, and have recently started to rush to produce tea for the market. It is heard that the price of each load of rough tea must be more than 60 to 70 yuan, and the cost is quite huge. It is expected that the market will see a rising trend.</p>
<h3>Grains Wheat Production Price is High, Flour Sales Are Flat As Before</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the beginning of the week for flour, and the spot flour market was trading normally. The reason is that the retail sales continued to decrease, and although the North and South regions had a finger in the pie, they were scattered. Moreover, the sales of large households in North China were quiet, and the factory was firm in selling because there was not much production at present. As a result, more than 20,000 bags of various brands of flour were traded at the original price. In addition to about 8,000 bags in this street's retail sales, the majority were from the Hebei and Shandong regions, followed by the Shantou and Min regions. The price of No. 2 flour factory's brand car boat brand was 4.8 yuan across the board, and the price of Green Hero was 4.45 yuan. It is also heard that the market price of foreign flour is 5 yuan per bag for spot goods, and the price for booking is about 4.67 yuan, but there is no transaction for the time being.</p>
<p>Today, 5,000 bags of flour will be exported to Tianjin, 4,500 bags to Yantai, 1,000 bags of bran, and 4,000 bags of flour to Shantou.</p>
<p>The source of wheat yesterday was not lonely, and about 8,900 bags arrived. Among them, 350 bags came from Xingang. The newly arrived goods still had high production prices, and the owners were insistent, but the factory's appetite was not very welcome. The reason is that since the current factories have been importing foreign wheat, they pay more attention to the selection of the quality of domestic wheat. Therefore, the market has been brewing for many days, and it has only risen slightly. The unified market sold four kinds of wheat from Jiangbei, Wuhu, Chuzhou, and Puzhen, totaling 7,000 bags, which were handled by Fuxin and Fufeng in half each. The market price has risen by several points compared with last week, with the highest being 6.55 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Thick Japonica Rice Arrives More 5,000 Bags Transferred to Tianjin</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of domestic rice arrived at No. 6, with nearly 8,000 bags of car wheel dumplings, of which thick japonica rice accounted for the majority. Therefore, at this time when the outlets in this street and hoarders are sluggish, it is even more difficult to gain a foothold. However, the selling parties have different ideas, some are willing to sell, and some are still unwilling to sell, so the market is chaotic. As a result, the price of Changxi region goods fell by more than 10 cents, while the intention of Sutong region was firmer, only tired by several points. However, the source of thin rice is even smaller, and the prices are recognized as having fallen through, and they are all instructed to defend. The market is reluctantly stable. Duyang Jian, Pu Jian, and Bianyuan are also devalued by 10 cents and a few cents, respectively. Yesterday, 5,400 bags of rice came from Hong Kong and were transferred to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Middle and Secondary Ke Xian Drops Sharply by 10 to 20 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of Ke Xian was endless. Although new transactions have been mostly stopped, there are still a large number of stocks to be transported, and some Ke vendors still plan to move small amounts due to the deposit relationship in the area. Many scattered vendors are depreciating prices in the market to get rid of them, so the middle and secondary Wu Xian fell to about 9.5 yuan, which is 10 to 20 cents lower than the previous market. However, high-quality goods are still trying to maintain firmness, so the market yesterday was only 5 to 6 cents lower, it is said.</p>
<h3>Yellow Beans High Quality is Extremely Scarce Market Price Moves Forward Step by Step Bean Cakes Transported to Shantou and Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The yellow bean market continued to see upward promotion. At the moment, only Chongming beans are available in the market, and they are constantly arriving, but they are also decreasing day by day, especially high-quality goods are extremely scarce, so the market price of middle and low-quality goods is becoming more firm and expensive. Yesterday, the lowest price of Chongming sand yellow had been opened to 7.41 yuan, and the highest price was still opened to 7.55 yuan. Although the price has not moved, in terms of quality, there must be a difference of 4 to 5 cents. Pinghu Du beans rose by more than 10 cents compared to last week, and more than 200 bags were traded at a price of 9 yuan and 9.2 yuan, which were handled by this street and Xiaoluzong region. 300 bags of Wuhu beans were opened at a price of 7.5 yuan. This bean is most suitable for the outlet of this street. Chongming sand yellow was purchased by this street, Xiamen, Xinghua, and other three regions for more than 700 sentences.</p>
<p>Today, 930 bags of soybeans will be transported to Shantou and 150 bags to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Also, today, 2,000 pieces of large soybean cakes and 2,110 pieces of small soybean cakes will be transported to Shantou.</p>
<p>There will also be 380 bags of raw peanuts transported to Shantou and 100 bags to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 4,000 pieces of bean oil came from Dalian, and 1,100 pieces of raw oil came from Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Dutch Coarse White Falls Frequently</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Dutch coarse white continued to decline. The association's price for spot goods of 24 Dutch coarse white outside the warehouse was 24.1 yuan, 24.3 yuan in this warehouse, and 24.5 yuan for Dayu Qianmai, all down 20 cents. The decline in transit goods was even greater, falling into the 16 yuan range and traded at 15.9 yuan, a drop of nearly 1 yuan compared to the highest price, and 40 cents less than the previous day. The trend seems difficult to stabilize. Taikoo Chebai is still holding the original price, but there are few transactions. The source of new domestic sugar is still lacking. It is found that only 35 bags of white sugar arrived on the Yunnan round the day before yesterday, and according to Quanzhou telegrams, the land price has risen by 3 yuan, and only more than 400 bags of goods were transported. The opening price of the number plate is also small. Dozens of bags of ordinary Shantou red goods were traded at a price of 14.6 yuan. Also, yesterday, 1,100 bags of sugar came from Shantou.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods Red Qiantong Low Price Causes Hoarding</h3>
<p>Ordinary red qiantong, because it is not a sales season, the lowest price has reached 245 yuan. The highest price must be more than 40 yuan, and the decline has reached one-third, which can be said to be extremely low and has attracted much attention. Gradually, there are buyers hoarding, and the price has rebounded slightly, opening to 27 yuan. Yesterday, the market price for high-quality goods had to be 30 yuan, but according to the land price, it is still difficult to calculate with the difficulty of transportation and high external expenses.</p>
<h3>Newly Built Mushrooms Source is Not Sustained</h3>
<p>Since the new goods of Fujian mushrooms have been launched, the arrival of goods has been interrupted due to the fact that the production area has not yet flourished. The needs of various regions are very strong. It is found that the local stock is extremely thin, so the goods in the hands of the industry have been tightened unanimously. It is heard that the Hong Kong region is handling it, such as the new mushroom market asking for 225 yuan to 220 yuan, and the old mushrooms are also brought high to 190 yuan, and both need cash, which is expected to be traded immediately.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports Coming and Going Goods are Quite Strong</h3>
<p>Xiamen also has a large batch of honey tangerines, totaling more than 1,500 pieces, and Shantou tangerines also have 380 pieces, and 2,500 pieces of kiln goods. Yesterday's imports, today, 4,000 boxes of kerosene will go to Shantou.</p>
<p>400 tons of foreign paper and 40 barrels of pigments came from Italy. There were also 200 tons of steel concentrate transferred to Osaka. 140 pieces of tobacco leaves came from Ningbo. 550 pieces of tea powder came from Hong Kong. 4,000 bags of fertilizer powder from Hong Kong were transferred to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Hardware Green Lead Iron Sales Suddenly Rise</h3>
<p>Green lead iron has recently become more expensive due to the high prices of steel from Huisitong, so users have mostly switched to selling it. The market situation has been extraordinarily busy in recent days. Tianjin's thermos bottle factories, cigarette companies, can factories, and other factories need it frequently. Although it is the end of the lunar year, the transaction still reaches a huge 5600 boxes. The market is rising step by step with supply not meeting demand. The price per box is sold to 43.5 yuan, which is another 50 cents higher than the previous day. The double joint market is priced at 45 yuan, which is also 1 yuan higher than before. A survey shows that the stock in Shanghai is limited, and no new goods have been shipped. The holders are highly motivated and unwilling to easily let go, so it is expected that the market situation will not ease in the future. According to overseas pricing, the latest price is 6 gold yuan (200 pounds per box), which is also half a yuan better than before, and there is a lack of recent road goods. It is expected that the market situation in the future will not tend to fall.</p>

<h3>Western Foss Defeated East Selai Yesterday, Coming Back from Behind to Win 4-2</h3>
<p>In the Western Union Football Group A match between Western Foss and East Selai, the game was held at the Racecourse at 3:00 PM on Sunday in the rain.

The East team thought they could secure the victory, but who knew that disaster would arise suddenly, and McClung brought the ball in and tied the score at 2-2. Then, Welson and Fraser each scored a goal, and as a result, Western Foss came back from behind to win 4-2.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Private Shanghai Cup Small Football Match: China Greatly Defeated Huaxing; China Team Forfeited Against Samsung</h3>
<p>There were originally three private Shanghai Cup small football matches yesterday. Then, the game between Paramount A and Jinke was postponed at the request of both sides, with the approval of the competition committee, so only two games remained. In the match between China and Huaxing, due to the disparity in strength, the game became one-sided. In the first half, China's Zhuang Jifang, Wu Kuiyuan, Zhou Kecheng, and Zhang Zhaowen scored successively, taking a 4-0 lead. In the second half, China's Zhang Zhaowen, Liu Xingfa, and Liao Shiyi each scored a goal. As a result, China defeated Huaxing 7-0. In the other game, Samsung was leading 2-0 when the China Team did not have enough players and did not finish the game. There are still three games today, all of which will be tense. Especially the games between Paramount B and Jinke, and Samsung and Shenqu will have more exciting performances.</p>

<h3>Medical and Pharmaceutical Advertisements That Exploit the Weaknesses of the World</h3>
<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>In the latest issue of this publication, Song Ke and his associates have written a masterpiece titled "The Public's Understanding of Exaggerated Medical and Pharmaceutical Advertisements," which is as powerful as Chen Lin's proclamation, enough to cure Cao Cao's headache. In this quiet, isolated island, one cannot but feel a sense of a lone voice in an empty valley. From this, we know that the righteousness of the world has not completely disappeared! I read six or seven kinds of Chinese and foreign newspapers every day, and I always feel that the famous newspapers at sea occupy huge pages for medical and pharmaceutical advertisements, which cannot but attract people to browse. But if we examine it, the medical advertisements that occupy the most space are for venereal diseases, and the pharmaceutical advertisements that occupy the most space are for tonics. We know that the business acumen of the medical and pharmaceutical industry has reached a high level. Why? Because venereal diseases are secret, and patients are often reluctant to seek doctors they know well and reveal their secrets. Therefore, the so-called doctors take advantage of this weakness and elaborate on various symptoms, so that patients can compare their hidden troubles and swallow the bait, and then their plan will succeed. This is why advertisements for venereal diseases are large, numerous, and tirelessly detailed! Tonics are like medicines but not medicines. There is no possibility of immediate effect, and there is a need for long-term use. Whether the medicine is effective or not is not proven; whether the body needs it or not is not asked. In short, to put it all together, the medicine is omnipotent, and everyone can take it. Over time, it seems that there is an unexpected effect. And thinking of those who take tonics, most of them are economically well-off, so in addition to food supplements, they continue with medicinal supplements. Once they try it, why not take it for a long time? The rich mostly think like this. This is why advertisements for tonics are large, numerous, and all-encompassing! Alas! The revelation of the medical and pharmaceutical advertising policy is Song Wang's intention, Song Wang's wish.</p>
<p>Popular Medical Talks</p>
<h3>One of Random Talks on Typhoid Fever (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Kecheng</p>
<p>Is it Typhoid Fever?</p>
<p>The disease Typhoid Fever has existed since ancient times. Therefore, the ancient medical books have long recorded this disease name. However, unfortunately, according to Dr. Zhang Zihe's detailed analysis in his book "Discussion on Chinese Medicine Science," the "Treatise on Typhoid Fever" does not actually discuss typhoid fever at all, but rather influenza. This completely overturns the reliance on old medical knowledge. Therefore, it's better for us experts to talk about typhoid fever.</p>
<p>Fever is a symptom, and many diseases can cause fever. Typhoid fever is one of the fever-causing diseases. Therefore, typhoid fever also has the symptom of fever. At the same time, because fever is an obvious symptom, it is easily noticed by patients. Also, the dread of typhoid fever is deeply rooted in people's minds. Thus, when people experience fever, they suspect this disease. However, as mentioned above, fever is not limited to typhoid fever. It would be very presumptuous to determine whether it is typhoid fever based solely on fever. Although everyone is now measuring body temperature, they are not filling out temperature charts and are constantly using diaphoretic drugs, making the situation even more confusing and unclear.</p>
<p>Since the introduction of new medical knowledge, everyone also knows that the pulse of typhoid fever does not increase in proportion to body temperature. This seems to provide another basis for judgment. However, the slow pulse of typhoid fever is only seen in adults. As for children, young neurotic women, and elderly people with arteriosclerosis, their pulse rates are often not slow. This point is also unreliable.</p>
<p>The Diazo reaction is also a method for early diagnosis of typhoid fever. However, in mild cases of typhoid fever, many show negative results. Furthermore, diseases that show a positive Diazo reaction are not limited to typhoid fever. Even if one understands this method, one is still at a loss.</p>
<p>Leukopenia is also an important symptom of typhoid fever. However, many infectious diseases also show this symptom. Especially in children, lymphocytes are naturally more numerous than in adults. Compared to adults, the reduction may not be significant.</p>
<p>Serum reaction (Widal test) can be said to be an important method for determining typhoid fever. However, first, this positive reaction must occur after the second week of the illness, especially reaching its highest level in the third week. However, doctors cannot wait for this positive reaction to appear before prescribing medication. So, although it is a good method, it cannot be used for emergencies. Second, this positive reaction is also seen in other diseases, especially miliary tuberculosis. If one makes a mistake, the harm is far more serious than a slight error in measurement.</p>
<p>Bacterial detection. This is the most reliable and early method to obtain good results. Because the pathogenic bacteria of typhoid fever appear in the blood in the early stages. The more time that passes, the higher the detection rate. Therefore, if you want to determine whether it is typhoid fever early, this method is excellent.</p>
<p>As for relying on tongue coating, mental state, appetite, and appearance to judge, not only is it not permitted in terms of time, but it also has no great value in reality. From this perspective, diagnosing typhoid fever is probably not an easy task!</p>
<p>Common Knowledge of Treatment</p>
<h3>The Greatest Attention in the Treatment of Nervous Breakdown</h3>
<p>— Wang Yugang</p>
<p>The severity of nervous breakdown in the present era can be inferred from the proportion of outpatient cases, the proportion of inquiry cases, and the proportion of drug advertisements. It is rampant. This is not just a medical problem, which makes people in the medical field feel worried, feel that his disease type will become more and more evil in the future, and the harm to the future of the country and the nation is very great. Even people in the education field are aware that he is a current problem for students, and want to resist this crazy tide. Therefore, there is a gradual trend of advocating sex education. I have received too many letters asking about this disease and treatment methods for many years. To avoid the trouble of answering them one by one, I published a booklet on self-treatment of nervous breakdown.</p>
<p>Its nature is divided into two major categories: one is a state of hypersensitivity, that is, a state of excitement, and the other is a state of sluggishness, that is, a state of paralysis. The distinction between the two is not always clearly and unchangeably. Generally speaking, the latter is the successor of the former, so it is a matter of time, that is, a matter of degree. However, the difference between these two symptoms is very obvious. The former is like being prone to impulsiveness, being prone to excitement, premature ejaculation and spermatorrhea, etc. The latter is like lack of pleasure, often feeling tired, weakened erection, or impotence, etc. For these different symptoms, the treatment methods must be different. If you prescribe medicine at will and mistakenly believe in its efficacy, it is like adding fuel to the fire. It is not only useless, but also increases the suffering. This is what I have felt and said in the past. The most and greatest mistake is the abuse of endocrine preparations of the gonads. According to the patient's complaint, it is premature ejaculation.</p>
<p>Insomnia, irritability, etc., when asked about previous treatments, they said that they had been injected with "Sibao Ming" several times, which was not only ineffective, but even more severe. Using this treatment for this disease, isn't it like adding fuel to the fire? This kind of diagnosis is not uncommon. It is really the temptation of the current "era of endocrine treatment" to abuse "Sibao Ming" as a panacea for nervous breakdown and "914". However, if "914" is not used properly, there will be no future troubles. If "Sibao Ming" is not used properly, then there will be unstable results.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical Knowledge</p>
<h3>Scientific Chinese Medicine</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>Although Chinese medicine has the theory of cold, heat, warm, cool, rising, descending, floating, and sinking, these are all to cater to the mysterious principles of Yin, Yang, and the Five Elements. However, the effectiveness of Chinese medicine in treating diseases cannot be denied. For example, Pinellia ternata relieves vomiting, Ephedra sinica induces sweating, apricot kernels treat coughs, and rhubarb causes diarrhea. These are all real results. How can it relieve vomiting, induce sweating, treat coughs, and cause diarrhea? It is not known at all. This is knowing that it is so, but not knowing why. Now, if we want to know why, we must use some scientific organization and research. For example, use botany to recognize its genus, use pharmacognosy to identify its structure, use chemistry to analyze its properties, and use pharmacology to test its physiological functions and efficacy. Prepare a systematic report for doctors to use in clinical practice. In this way, not only can the existing efficacy be confirmed, but new efficacies are often discovered. However, this organization and research work requires sufficient funding and new medical and pharmaceutical talents with research experience, and a considerable period of time. It is not about roughly manufacturing various mild medicines of unknown nature, catering to a little bit of new medical and pharmaceutical knowledge that is still under research and discussion, and using fairy tale-like advertising techniques, to tell the public: this is a special medicine for a certain disease, this is a new medicine improved by scientific methods. Just like the medicines on the market recently that are not produced by medical professionals, deceiving themselves and others, they are really moths in the scientific community and harmful horses in the medical community. Now, in order to provide pharmaceutical manufacturers with something to follow and drug users with a standard, Chinese medicines that have been studied by people, whose properties have been clearly understood, and whose effects have been confirmed, are all based on academic theory and have become facts, and some have been included in the pharmacopoeia. Excerpted here, it can add to the general public's health knowledge; I think it is also a method of advocating the scientification of Chinese medicine. However, there may be omissions in the saying, I hope that medical and pharmaceutical colleagues can come forward and teach it. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Disease Prevention Knowledge</p>
<h3>Simple Method of Disinfection in Infectious Disease Homes (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yanggao</p>
<p>Since last year, epidemics have been constantly prevalent. In addition, the island is densely populated, and the infection is even worse. In order to prevent any eventuality, we must pay attention to the disinfection of sick homes. Disinfection is originally common sense. However, if you want to implement it, you must also study the method to be effective. Otherwise, it is just empty talk, that is, perfunctory, and there is nothing to add to the facts.</p>
<p>Disinfection of sick homes can be divided into two parts: clinical disinfection and final disinfection. Both are carried out at the same time to be effective.</p>
<p>(1) Clinical disinfection</p>
<p>Clinical disinfection means immediate disinfection. Regardless of the patient's excrement, daily necessities, and other objects, if they have had contact with the patient, they are all considered to be infected with germs. Therefore, disinfection must be carried out at any time to prevent the spread of germs.</p>
<p>(A) Disinfection of sputum, nasal mucus, nasal foam, oral saliva, mouth foam, mouthwash, vomit, feces, blood, pus, ulcerous rot, skin scabs and desquamated skin, etc. Those that can be wiped with paper can be burned immediately. Otherwise, first put them in a container containing disinfectant, so that they have at least two hours of contact. At the same time, pay attention to the entire object to be disinfected being immersed and covered by the disinfectant. Now, two cheap and easy-to-obtain disinfectants are introduced below: lime milk, the preparation method is to slowly add two parts of clear water to one part of fresh lime powder and mix well; for example, add three parts of water to one peck of fresh lime powder, a 3% carbolic acid solution, which can be purchased from a pharmacy. However, it often freezes in winter. You can put the medicine bottle in water to dissolve it, take out three cubic centimeters, and add one hundred cubic centimeters of water.</p>
<p>(B) Disinfection methods for tea and rice utensils (cups, bowls, chopsticks, spoons, etc.), washing utensils (washbasins, mouthwash cups, toothbrushes, towels, bath tubs, foot tubs, etc.), books, newspapers, toys, clothes and bedding, curtains, table cloths, etc. are also very simple. Those that can be boiled, such as bowls, cups, and clothes, should be boiled (boil for another fifteen minutes after boiling). For objects that cannot be put in water, except for books and toys, which can be burned, immerse them in a 1% formalin solution for two hours (formalin concentrated solution is available in pharmacies and is not expensive). For woolen items, leather, and rubber products, you can also spray this solution on them, brush them with a brush, and then dry them in the sun. The debris swept up on the floor of the sick room can be burned. For the disinfection of wooden furniture such as tables, desks, benches, and chairs, you can use a 3% carbolic acid diluted solution to wipe them.</p>
<p>(C) A washbasin containing 3% carbolic acid solution must be prepared in each sick room for temporary hand washing and other disinfection purposes. Family members or others who have been in contact with the patient must disinfect the body parts that have been touched, and then wash them with hot water and soap for five minutes.</p>

<h3>Three Foreign Ships Seized and Sailed to Qingdao, Yongzhen has been Released, Left Qingdao for Shanghai Yesterday Morning, Haida and Hava have not been Released, Consuls of Britain and Norway Decided to Continue Negotiations —Kailin Sailed to Fuyu Yesterday and was Forced to Return on the Same Ship—</h3>
<p>The three foreign ships Haida, Yongzhen, and Hava, which operate between Shanghai and Fuyu, were seized by Japanese warships at Yanghekou on the morning of the 27th and forced to sail to Qingdao. After the consuls of Britain and Norway made serious representations to the Japanese side yesterday, the Yongzhen was released after negotiations with the British naval authorities and left Qingdao for Shanghai at 8:30 yesterday morning. The British Kailin Marler sailed to Fuyu a few days ago, but was blocked by Japanese warships and returned on the same ship yesterday morning. Foreigners are extremely angry about this. The following are the details of the situation investigated by the reporter of the Modern News Agency:</p>
<p>British and Norwegian Consuls Telegraphed for Negotiations</p>
<p>The three foreign ships that were forced to sail to Qingdao by the Japanese side, Yongzhen, belongs to British merchants, and Haida and Hava belong to Norwegian merchants. After the incident occurred, the shipping companies reported to the British and Norwegian consuls in Shanghai respectively, requesting serious negotiations to demand their release as soon as possible. The consuls of the two countries telegraphed their consuls in Qingdao yesterday morning to negotiate with the Japanese side nearby. Yesterday afternoon, according to the report received from the Qingdao Consulate, the case was protested to the Japanese side, but they shirked responsibility to the Qingdao Customs authorities. Therefore, the negotiations have not been successful. It is said that the British and Norwegian consulates will continue to file strong protests.</p>
<p>Yongzhen First Released and Left Qingdao for Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the reporter of the Modern News Agency's inquiry with the Yongli Shipping Company yesterday, in addition to the British Consulate's negotiations with the Japanese side after the Yongzhen was detained, they also telegraphed the British naval authorities stationed in Qingdao to seriously negotiate with the responsible person of the Japanese Navy, demanding its return as soon as possible. Soon after, it was reported that the Yongzhen had been released by the Japanese side and left Qingdao at 8:00 yesterday morning and returned directly to Shanghai. It will arrive in port today. As for the Haida and Hava, there was also news of their release yesterday evening, but it has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>Kailin Sailed to Fuyu and was Forced to Return</p>
<p>The British Kailin Marler also operates on the Fuyu route. After the Haida and other ships were detained, the ship asked the British Consul General to inform the British Navy to send a British ship to protect the ship when it sailed from Shanghai on the 28th to ensure safety. After arriving at Yanghekou, the British ship went to Qingdao, but the ship was immediately blocked by four Japanese warships stationed at the port and could not enter Hexing Town to berth and unload cargo. It was not until 10:00 yesterday morning that it was forced to return to Shanghai from Yanghekou on the same ship. It will arrive in port today. According to the current situation, the port has been illegally blockaded by Japanese warships. Whether foreign ships can sail depends on negotiations.</p>
<p>Foreigners are Outraged by Japanese Actions</p>
<p>The British and American foreigners in this city have repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side for refusing to open the Yangtze River and preventing foreign ships from sailing, but to no avail. It is obvious that the Japanese side intends to squeeze out the rights and interests of foreigners in China. Therefore, the public is extremely angry. Since the Haida and other ships were detained and Kailin was prevented from unloading cargo, the foreign side believes that the Japanese actions are becoming more and more unreasonable. Therefore, in order to protect their rights and interests, they will once again request their respective governments to take further effective measures.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Direct Shipping Vessels Passenger and Cargo Restriction Measures</h3>
<p>Three Companies Will Meet Today to Discuss Unified Water Freight Prices, Passenger Tickets for Each Ship Will Temporarily Follow the Original Price When Direct Shipping</p>
<p>After the resumption of direct shipping on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, the ships Moufu, Xin'anna, and Liangzhou set sail for Ningbo the afternoon before yesterday, and the Deping is scheduled to sail directly to Ningbo today. In addition to loading cargo, passengers are also allowed to board, but there are considerable restrictions. Regarding the issue of water freight prices, Taikoo and other three companies will hold a meeting today to discuss it. As for passenger tickets, they will temporarily follow the original price when direct shipping. The following are the details of the situation investigated by the reporter of the Modern News Agency:</p>
<p>Loading and Passenger Restriction Measures</p>
<p>Since the Headquarters of the 10th Army Group promulgated the revised shipping regulations, allowing direct shipping on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, in accordance with the provisions of the new regulations, the approved</p>
<p>Conclusion of Interrogation of Kaibo Ship Crew</p>
<p>All Crew Members Return to Shanghai Today</p>
<p>The Kaibo struck a reef and sank in the Diaoban Ocean off Haimen, and all crew members were rescued and safely arrived in Taizhou. More than 40 of the crew members returned to Shanghai on the Shantai last Saturday (28th) led by the compradore Zhang Yunquan. The ship owner Olson, the first, second, and third mates, and the foreman and steward were still staying in Taizhou, waiting for the interrogation by the Wen-Tai Garrison Command, as reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday, the company received a telegram from the ship owner, saying that the interrogation had been concluded and they were allowed to return to Shanghai on the Hana, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. Vessels sailing on each route, whether from Ningbo to Shanghai or from Shanghai to Ningbo, are no longer prohibited from carrying passengers, but there are still considerable restrictions to prevent abuse. The measures are as follows: All Chinese men aged 16 to 45 are prohibited from leaving the country. Those who are not within this limit must hold legal documents (identity card or certificate from the local county government or above) before they can be released. Civil servants leaving the country on official business and students leaving the country to take entrance exams must hold legal certification documents from the dispatching agency for civil servants and from the county government or school of origin for students, otherwise they will not be allowed to leave the country. Merchants leaving the country to purchase goods or escort goods must submit an application form, attach a bareheaded photo of themselves two and a half inches in size, and obtain a guarantee from a reputable shop with more than 2,000 yuan in the local area, or a certification document from the local county government or above, before they are allowed to leave the country. Steamboat crew members are not allowed to go up and down the docks without holding the ship's documents. Entering passengers must hold appropriate documents, otherwise those who are considered to have suspicious behavior should be detained, refused to land, or released on bail, depending on the circumstances. All domestic native products are prohibited from being loaded and transported unless they have been approved by a higher authority, or stipulated by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, or approved by the Ministry after a commercial request. Enemy goods are absolutely prohibited from entering. Other foreign goods are allowed to be imported unless there are explicit restrictions from the Central Government or the Zhejiang Provincial Government.</p>
<p>Deping to Continue Sailing to Ningbo Today</p>
<p>The Moufu of Jardine Matheson, the Xin'anna of Butterfield &amp; Swire, and the Liangzhou of Taikoo set sail directly for Ningbo one after another the afternoon before yesterday. Except for the Liangzhou, which is a purely cargo ship and does not carry passengers, the other two ships, Moufu and Xin'anna, carried a small number of passengers, but all passengers prepared guarantee forms, photos, and other certification documents in accordance with the regulations and orders before they were allowed to purchase tickets and disembark. The procedures were very strict. It is learned that the Deping of Zhongyi Company is also scheduled to sail directly to Ningbo from Shanghai at 3:00 this afternoon. Passengers will also be handled in accordance with the regulations to ensure caution.</p>
<p>Shipping Companies Meet to Discuss Unified Water Freight</p>
<p>Regarding the water freight of goods on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, since the war, due to the obstruction of direct shipping, each ship detoured through Wentai, which increased expenses, and the price of coal soared. Therefore, the water freight continued to increase. Zhongyi Company once lowered the price and reduced it to 40% of the actual price, but the other ships have not been unified, resulting in chaotic prices. Now, Butterfield &amp; Swire, the shipping department of Reiss &amp; Co., and Zhongyi Shipping Company, in order to unify water freight prices and avoid price competition among their peers, have scheduled a meeting of representatives from the three companies at Taikoo at 11:00 this morning to discuss and determine a fair water freight price list in accordance with the intentions of the Zhejiang Provincial authorities, so that neither the company nor the passengers will suffer losses, and then report it to the Ningbo authorities for record and common compliance.</p>
<p>Ship Tickets Return to Original Price</p>
<p>The ship ticket prices on the Shanghai-Ningbo line were originally 3 yuan for the third class, 5 yuan for the cabin class, and 7 yuan for the official class when the ships were sailing directly, which was already more than double the price before the war. Later, due to the ban on shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo, passengers transferred to Taizhou, and the third class cost 8 yuan per person. When each ship detoured through Wen and sailed to Ningbo, the fare was also 8 yuan for the third class, 10 yuan for the cabin class, and 14 yuan for the official class, which was almost five or six times higher than before the war. Passengers traveling between Ningbo and Ningbo complained. Now that direct shipping has resumed, the passenger tickets have also been restored to the previously determined original price, which is still 3 yuan for the third class, 5 yuan for the cabin class, and 7 yuan for the official class. However, the Deping sells 1.5 yuan for the third class, 4 yuan for the cabin class, and 6 yuan for the official class when returning from Ningbo to Shanghai. It is said that the prices are still temporary and may be adjusted again within days.</p>
<p>The General Closing Period is Approaching Financial Markets are Stable</p>
<p>The Money Industry is Scheduled to Hold a Regular Meeting the Day After Tomorrow to Discuss Market Interest Rates</p>
<p>Since the Money Industry Association decided that February 18th was the general closing period for the 27th year of the Republic of China, and the four days of the 19th, 20th, 21st, and 22nd were the general settlement period, all stores uniformly took holidays to handle the closing. Each industry decided to handle the general settlement based on the money industry. Now, as the general settlement period is approaching, preparations have been made separately. For the accounts in this city, invoices are distributed and the repayment deadline is limited. Staff are sent to collect the accounts in other cities separately, and the responsible managers allocate funds to smoothly pass this general settlement period. The Money Industry Association has issued a notice to convene a regular meeting of member representatives at 2:00 p.m. on February 2nd to discuss preparations before and after the general settlement, such as market interest rates, the time for each store to collect and return tickets on New Year's Eve, and the listing date after the general settlement. According to the reporter of the New Voice Agency's inquiry with each industry yesterday, Shanghai after the war, due to the increase in population and the destruction of factories in the inland, the production has decreased. Therefore, the factories within the concession have developed abnormally, especially the national goods factories. The newly established factories in the concession are like mushrooms after rain. In terms of silk factories, there are about 25 newly established ones. There are more than 100 newly established cotton spinning, knitting, and silk weaving factories. The factories in the inland have also moved to Shanghai to start work. There are also three newly emerging needle factories in Shanghai. Regarding the financial market on the isolated island, it is still stable as always. Therefore, there will be no unfortunate events during the general settlement period, which is very different from the 26th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>The Pudong Guerrilla Team is Active and the Japanese Side Has Increased Troops</p>
<p>Due to the great strength of the guerrilla teams in Fengxian, Chuansha, and Nanhui counties, the Japanese army recently felt that it was difficult to cope with the original garrison in Pudong. Therefore, 200 or so troops stationed in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Songjiang were transferred to reinforce the defense the day before yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, about 80 dead and wounded Japanese soldiers were transported from Nanhuangpu to Hongkou on small transport ships, waiting to be transported to Japan.</p>
<h3>Farewell Banquet for the Chinese Directors of the Bureau of Public Works for the British Army Commander</h3>
<p>Major General Simmalé Promoted to Governor of the Strait Islands</p>
<p>Major General Simmalé, the commander of the British Army stationed in Shanghai, has been in Shanghai for many years and will soon be transferred to another location (promoted to Governor of the British Strait Islands). All the Chinese directors of the Bureau of Public Works of the Public Concession, after the "August 13th" Songhu Anti-Japanese War, the commander had served as the commander-in-chief of the Allied Forces of Britain, the United States, Italy, and other countries stationed in Shanghai, commanding the defense forces, planning security, and sparing no effort. He was especially sympathetic to the rescue of refugees.

The guests and hosts toasted each other and the banquet ended in joy at about 2:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Last Month's Shanghai Municipal Council Monthly Report</h3>
<p>Satisfactory Sanitary Conditions, Extremely Burdensome Police Work</p>
<p>Health Report</p>
<p>According to the Health Officer's report for December, the sanitary conditions in this port were still unsatisfactory due to the prevalence of smallpox. A large number of Chinese people migrated from other ports without being vaccinated, making it easy for smallpox to spread. The number of recorded Chinese deaths was 5,900, including 4,842 exposed corpses. The main causes of death were smallpox, tuberculosis, and typhoid fever. Various infectious diseases of the digestive system had mostly disappeared, while infectious diseases of the respiratory system had increased due to the gradual cold weather. The Health Department continued to distribute milk to women and children in refugee camps. All infectious disease hospitals established by the Shanghai Municipal Council were overcrowded due to the prevalence of smallpox, but these hospitals had been expanded, so the problem of bed availability was not as serious as before. The work of the school medical department continued as usual. The department inspected private Chinese schools that had received or applied for subsidies from the Shanghai Municipal Council 208 times. Cases of smallpox were found in several schools, so the Health Department had to perform special supervisory duties and take preventive measures. The veterinary department continued to inspect imported pigs. Of the 52,064 live pigs imported last month, 0.87% died during transportation to this port. In November of last year, the mortality rate was only 0.35%. This increase in the mortality rate was entirely due to the cold weather and slow transportation. The business of vegetable markets in the western and central districts of the Settlement was as prosperous as before, and the vegetable markets in the northeastern districts had gradually returned to normal. The vaccination campaign continued, but the results were worse than in November. Huts in various places were inspected as usual in January, and the sanitary conditions had improved significantly. The number of refugee camps and the number of refugees accommodated had decreased. The large refugee camp on Duncin Road will be opened soon, and it is hoped that all the refugees currently occupying private houses in the central and northern districts can be moved there. Personnel were also sent to inspect coffin depositories at any time. All coffins were found to be structurally sound and tightly sealed, so as not to impede hygiene. Cremation of corpses was performed once a day. Personnel responsible for preventing malaria have begun surveying the western district, with the intention of filling in places where stagnant water accumulates to prevent mosquito breeding.</p>
<p>Police Report</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Department handled 1,773 criminal cases in December of last year, an increase of 58 cases compared to November of the same year. A total of 1,672 criminals were arrested by the department. In addition, there were 164 criminals who committed crimes in previous months, and 24 criminals who were arrested on behalf of government offices outside the Settlement. There were 68 people who committed crimes using firearms. Nine firearms, along with a large amount of ammunition, were seized. Among the recorded major criminal cases were seven attempted murder cases, one armed robbery case, and one bombing case. The narcotics division of the Police Department conducted ten searches and arrested 28 opium offenders. The police stations handled 28 opium cases and arrested 81 opium offenders. Many newly established opium dens and gambling houses have appeared on the roads outside the Settlement in the western district, which often leads to disturbances by bandits, endangering public safety. In view of this situation, the Police Department has set up wire mesh frames in several places and searched passers-by to prevent accidents. The number of workers in the Settlement has gradually increased. Last month there were more than 149,000 workers. A portion of the employees of the Commercial Press once went on strike, but soon resumed work. As of the end of last month, there were 68 refugee camps in the Settlement, accommodating a total of 49,844 refugees. In addition, there were 4,770 refugees living in alleys and empty houses. Six Chinese newspapers were warned by the police for publishing inaccurate news or inappropriate text. A total of 34 publication registration certificates were issued. A total of 39,117 public rickshaw pullers have been registered. A total of 924 public rickshaw pullers were punished by the Central and Louza police stations for violating traffic regulations. In addition, the licenses of 50 public rickshaw pullers were withheld for one month for carrying objects on their vehicles that could easily damage or destroy the vehicles. There were 970 accidents that caused injury or property damage. Street vendors, beggars, and vagrants were continuously expelled by the police at any time.</p>
<h3>Muslims Celebrate "Eid" Today</h3>
<p>Muslims from all directions pay homage to the Kaaba, and all believers gather for prayers in the mosque.</p>
<p>Today is one of the major annual gatherings of Islam. Muslims who can go to Mecca to pay homage to the Kaaba gather at the Kaaba Mosque today to hold a major prayer. Muslims in various places will also go to the local mosque to hold prayers, and slaughter livestock to distribute to relatives, friends, and the general public. Islam calls it the "Eid" festival, which means the festival of sacrifice. It has three meanings: 1. unity; 2. sacrifice; 3. charity. Muslims in this city will go to five places for worship: the Zhejiang Road Mosque, the Xujiahui Road Mosque, the Xiaoshadu Road Mosque, the Hongshoufang Mosque, and the Gordon Road Mosque. In addition, the Islamic Association of this city has specially printed and distributed Eid special issues widely. At the same time, the income and expenditure report booklet printed by the Islamic Association's Disaster Relief Association will also be distributed in various halls.</p>
<h3>Senior Municipal Council Officials Received Salary Increase Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Outside World's Protests Did Not Stop It; The Committee Has Not Yet Made a Recommendation</p>
<p>The English-language "Great Evening News" reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council disregarded public protests and paid salaries today (the 30th). Higher and next-highest-level officials all received large salaries. Lower-level officials who needed salary increases received very little, which aroused public dissatisfaction. The Christmas subsidy, which caused public dissatisfaction, was also distributed. The Shanghai Municipal Council, in view of public opposition, organized a committee of business representatives to investigate the matter, but in fact did not change its decision. The public expected that the salary increase plan should at least be postponed until the business representatives submitted a report, but now they are disappointed. According to Committee Chairman Hawkins, who spoke to reporters this morning, the association has not yet reported its findings to the authorities. Municipal Council Secretary-General Philip also said that the authorities must receive a report on the progress of the committee before they can know it. According to today's Japanese-language "Continental New News", the Japanese Residents Association in Hongkou is also troubled by the salary problem. The salaries of some teachers in Japanese schools are too low, so they are looking for other jobs. The salaries of the employees of the Residents Association are all 30% lower than the salary standards of the employees of Japanese commercial firms. The decline in the "efficiency" of school teachers is also due to low salaries. The association is now considering increasing the salaries of employees and teachers.</p>
<h3>Changshu Guerrilla Fights Bravely; Japanese and Puppet Troops Suffer Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Commander Cai Has Submitted the Anti-Japanese War Process to the War Zone Commander to Request Commendation</p>
<p>Modern News Agency reported that, according to people from Changshu, at six o'clock in the morning the day before yesterday, 300 to 400 Japanese and puppet troops advanced on Dongtang Town, more than 20 li away from the city, in three routes. One route went east from Wuta, one route went north from Weijingtang outside Qimen in Suzhou, and one route went south from Chenxiang. When the Japanese and puppet troops advanced to about four or five li away from the town, they came into contact with the sentry post of Zhang Jinlin's unit, the ××th Battalion Commander of Cao Changjin's department, Deputy Commander of the People's Self-Defense Force and Commander of the 11th Ladder Regiment of the Changshu, Jia, Tai, Kun, Qing, and Song Six-County Guerrilla. The gunfire was dense, and the Chinese army stationed in the rear responded to the sound to support them. Battalion Commander Zhang disregarded his personal safety and personally led the team to charge forward. The fierceness of the battle was even greater than the two battles of Jiulijiao and Licun before Changshu was lost. It only eased slightly until one o'clock in the afternoon. In this battle, the Japanese and puppet troops suffered 70 to 80 casualties, and a lot of weapons and ammunition were captured. On the Chinese side, only six or seven people were killed or injured. It is reported that the cause of the incident in the town was that the traitor Gui Zijia (i.e. the puppet county magistrate) wanted to buy over Cao's department and reorganize it into the puppet "Security Team", but because Commander Cao refused to accept it, he instigated the Japanese and puppets to invade, trying to threaten him. Now Commander Cai has reported the battle process of Cao's department to Commander Gu of the Third War Zone and will be awarded.</p>
<h3>Portuguese New Consul General Manuel Succeeds</h3>
<p>The Continental News reported yesterday (29th) that, according to responsible sources, Portuguese Consul General to Shanghai Alves, who once served as Chairman of the Consular Corps in this port, has been transferred to New York as Consul General, but will wait for his successor to arrive in Shanghai before leaving. The successor is Manuel, the current Portuguese Consul General in Hamburg. Mr. Manuel is a Doctor of Law from the University of Lisbon. He entered the diplomatic world in early 1912 and has served as a consul in the United Kingdom and other countries. He has a good reputation.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Explains the Regulations on Cooperative Banks</h3>
<p>In areas where cooperative banks have been established, no cooperative banks of the same level may be established.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs instructed the Agricultural and Commercial Bank to explain that Article 5 of the Cooperative Bank Regulations stipulates that no more than two cooperative banks of the same level may be established in the same area, which means that in areas where cooperative banks have been established, no cooperative banks of the same level may be established again. Please be informed and pass on the information. This order.</p>
<h3>Fifty Scout Groups Hold Memorial for the Four Martyrs and Mourn Citizen Cang Chengquan</h3>

<h3>Taking Shanghai as a Haven, Jewish Refugees Are Coming in an Endless Stream; The Number Will Exceed 4,000 and the Relief Association Cannot Cope</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Daily reported that the Italian mail ship "Conte Verde" arrived in Shanghai yesterday (29th) afternoon, carrying 420 German and Austrian Jews. Therefore, the number of Jewish refugees in Shanghai has reached about 2,000. The group arrived at the Customs Wharf at 7:00 p.m. After their luggage was inspected, they were sent to various residences in Hongkou reserved for them by the various relief committees. In the future, more Jewish refugees will take this port as their destination, because they really cannot obtain visas to enter other countries. Although some of the Jewish refugees who have arrived in Shanghai have found jobs in this port, and a few have brought money with them, most of them are destitute. Moreover, according to news from Rome, 1,000 Jews, mostly from Germany, had already boarded the Italian mail ship "Conte Biancamano" in Naples, Italy, on Friday and set off for Shanghai, which is expected to arrive on February 22nd. In addition, two ships sailing between Germany and the United States have been rented in Hamburg to transport Jewish refugees from Germany to Shanghai, totaling as many as 2,000 people. Most of these refugees will stay in Shanghai, and a few will transfer to Dalian, because about 300 people have been approved by the Dalian authorities to live there. On Friday of last week, ten immigrants landed in Shanghai, and 100 more came to Shanghai yesterday, mostly from Germany, and have been provided with temporary residences by the relief committee. The Shanghai Committee for the Relief of European Jewish Immigrants has encountered an extremely serious situation due to a lack of sufficient funds. Now that 2,000 more people are about to arrive, it will be even more difficult, because Germany implements strict regulations on individuals carrying money out of the country. Therefore, among the refugees who have come to Shanghai, only 20% can support themselves. The various relief committees need 90,000 yuan per month to maintain the refugees' food and accommodation. The Shanghai Municipal Council has asked the Consular Corps to pay attention to this issue and consider a proper way to at least temporarily curb the continued arrival of refugees, but no definite conclusion has been reached so far.</p>
<h3>Fellow Villagers Form a Fundraising Association to Implement Piggy Bank Relief</h3>

If the user does not have time to send it, please notify in advance, and the association will send personnel to collect it, immediately unseal and count the amount of money at the user's residence, and then fill out the receipt, and return the original piggy bank and replace it with a new one for the user to use. F. The piggy bank is sealed by the association. After opening it, it will be sealed again or replaced with a new one for use. G. This campaign is temporarily scheduled for three months, and it may be extended if necessary. H. There are also special relief piggy banks, and the methods for distributing them will be determined separately.</p>
<p>Soliciting Winter Clothing</p>
<p>The Second Shelter of the West Elmhurst Road International Relief Association has been transferred to it by the French Concession Police Department for the past two days, reaching more than 300 beggars, all of whom have no winter clothing, which is deeply sympathetic. I hope all circles will donate winter clothing, whether new or old, please send them directly to the International Relief Association on the third floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA.</p>
<p>Pig Industry Donation</p>
<p>The Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Fresh Pig Industry Association has now decided that in the future, both the traveler and the seller will donate 2 cents of refugee relief funds per pig. The sales will not increase prices additionally. It will be implemented starting on February 1st of this year.</p>
<p>Anhui Fellow Villagers</p>
<p>The Anhui Ning Travel Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association held a meeting of the fundraising team leaders at the association yesterday (29th). Chairman Cao Zhigong discussed and decided: A. In addition to the previously appointed team leaders, several more team leaders will be added to actively promote and strive for practical results.

<h3>U.S., German, and British Trade with China Fell Sharply Last Year</h3>
<p>Affected by the Japanese Seizure of Customs, Imports Decreased Significantly Compared to the Previous Year</p>
<p>After the Japanese seized the customs in the occupied areas, they forcibly reduced the tax rate on Japanese goods, deposited tax revenue in Japanese banks, and hindered the import of foreign goods in order to facilitate the dumping of Japanese goods. The trade between the United States, Germany, Britain, and other countries and China has been greatly affected, and the value of imported and exported goods has decreased sharply. However, the import and export of Japanese goods has suddenly increased, making it the crown of all countries. The trade between the United States, Germany, Britain, and Japan with China in the past two years is recorded as follows (units in thousands of yuan):</p>
<p>The Government Plans to Issue 500 Million Yuan of National Construction Bonds</p>
<p>Exclusively for the Development of Treasures in Various Provinces; the Industrial Cooperation Association Sets Up Four Branches</p>
<p>In order to develop the rich resources of the southwest, the National Government, in addition to planning to complete the southwest and northwest railway networks, is also building highways in various provinces to facilitate transportation. Although the provincial capitals of Guizhou, Sichuan, Kang, Qing, Xinjiang, Gansu, Xia, Shaanxi, Yunnan, and Guangxi have now been opened to traffic in sections, bridges, vehicles, and driving equipment are very lacking. The Ministry of Communications has now established a Highway General Administration Office to handle road construction and driving matters, so as to make them safe, fast, accurate, convenient, and economical. In addition, the Highway Bureaus of the nine provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Qian, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Kang have been established to handle the joint transportation of highways in the nine provinces and are responsible for rectifying the accumulated abuses of highways, so as to maximize the benefits of transportation and cooperate with the Highway General Administration Office in division of labor. The former is responsible for management, and the latter is engaged in engineering design and planning, and various supervision matters. For the unfinished Yunnan-Guangxi, Sichuan-Yunnan, Sichuan-Kang, Sichuan-Gansu, Gansu, Sichuan-Qing, Kang-Yunnan, Shaanxi-Ningxia, Sichuan-Hubei, and other main lines, and other necessary branch lines, plans have been made to complete them selectively in the short term as a supplement to railway transportation.</p>
<h3>Membership of Trade Associations is Limited to Nationals of the Republic of China</h3>
<p>Managers or Agents of Foreign Shipping Companies May of Course Become Members If There is No Foreign Capital</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs explained the nationality doubts of members of trade associations and sent a letter to the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, stating that the application of the Ministry of Communications for clarification of the doubts about the nationality of members of the Commercial Trade Association was approved by the discussion and reply of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the relevant notification was issued, and the original application was copied and sent to the Ministry. It was found that the commercial trade association takes companies and firms in the same area as members, and expressly stipulates that representatives of members are limited to those with the nationality of the Republic of China, then the nationality of members is also limited to the nationality of the Republic of China. For example, as explained by the Judicial Yuan on June 14, 1933, No. 933, if the shareholders of a foreign firm are all citizens of the Republic of China, they are in line with the so-called stores in Article 9 of the Chamber of Commerce Law and the so-called firms in Article 7 of the Industrial and Commercial Association Law, and should be allowed to join the Chamber of Commerce as members. The so-called companies and firms that manage or act as agents for foreign ships and steamers in the original application may of course become members of the commercial trade association if there is no foreign capital and the managers or agents are all citizens of the Republic of China. As for Article 5 of the Commercial Trade Association Law, it stipulates that there is only one commercial trade association in the same area. If Yongjia County already has such a trade association, it does not seem appropriate to approve the establishment again.</p>
<h3>Introducing Refugee Occupations</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan Approved the Formulation of Measures and Organizations to Apply for Subsidies</p>
<p>The Relief Committee has been planning the transport, reception, allocation, and participation in production enterprises for the relief of refugees in the war zone. However, after investigation, the organs, factories, organizations, and shops in the rear often need employees. There are many refugees who have not yet been employed and have expertise, but they suffer from the fact that there is a lack of liaison and introduction agencies, and the supply and demand cannot meet each other. Previously, Wuhan was a concentrated area of refugees, and the 8th Relief Area tried out job introduction, which had considerable results. It is planned to handle it in a unified manner, and the relief branch associations of each relief area and each province and city will be held separately, and the social organizations with reputation will be entrusted to handle it depending on the circumstances, so as to promote relief. The draft of eight articles of the measures for introducing refugees to occupations and five articles of the measures for social organizations to apply for subsidies for introducing refugees to occupations have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>
<p>Introduction Method</p>
<p>The introduction of refugees to occupations shall be handled by the agencies and organizations designated or entrusted by the association: 1. The offices of the association's relief areas; 2. The general and branch stations for transporting and allocating refugees; 3. The relief associations of each province, city, and county; 4. Social organizations with a reputation. Social organizations that are entrusted by the association to handle the introduction of refugees to occupations may apply to the association for subsidies in accordance with the separately formulated rules for applying for subsidies. Refugees who request to be introduced to occupations shall apply for registration with the agencies and organizations that handle the introduction of refugees to occupations. Organs, organizations, schools, factories, shops, or individuals that need employees may request the introduction of employees to the agencies and organizations that handle the introduction of refugees to occupations, but after receiving the letters introducing employees, whether they are hired or not, they shall reply within three days, and those who have been hired shall state their service location, position, and treatment, and if there are any changes, they shall report them for record at any time.</p>
<p>Subsidy Funds</p>
<p>The main points of the rules for social organizations to apply for subsidies for introducing refugees to occupations are as follows: The subsidy shall not exceed 50% of the budget for the group's expenses for introducing refugees to occupations. If the association considers that the group that accepts the association's subsidies is not doing a good job, it may stop the subsidy.</p>
<h3>The Transportation Industry in This Port is Gradually Declining</h3>
<p>More Than 30 Companies Will Be Closed</p>
<p>After the restoration of inland transportation, the transportation industry in Shanghai flourished like bamboo shoots after a rain, especially along the Suzhou River, which was almost lined up one after another. Because of the fierce competition in the same industry, the amount of money released was very small, and the expenses were huge, so they could not be maintained. The shipping companies such as Lixingyuan Feng, Anchang, etc. declared liquidation. Li Weixuan, the manager of the Taihe Water and Land Transportation Company in Pentang Lane Bridge East, also declared liquidation by lawyer Chen Xingmin due to excessive losses and inability to operate. According to people in the industry, there will be more than 30 companies that will be closed after the end of the Lunar New Year.</p>
<h3>Jiading Bank Convenes a Meeting to Discuss Resumption</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Fulfill the Reconciliation Plan After Jiading Bank closed, it applied to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for reconciliation in accordance with the Bankruptcy Law. The proposed reconciliation plan has been approved by the creditors' meeting on November 26, 1938, and the reconciliation contract was signed at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on December 5, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent it to the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special Zone Local Court for record. It is now scheduled to implement the reconciliation plan from February 1, 1939, that is, to pay 15% of the cash to each ordinary creditor, 33% of the stock certificate, and 35% of the debt certificate as full payment, and scheduled to convene a shareholders' meeting at 3:00 p.m. on March 1 at the Bank Association on the fifth floor of 59 Hong Kong Road to discuss amending the articles of association, determine the date of resumption, and re-elect directors and supervisors.</p>
<h3>The Sixth Installment of Unified Principal and Interest Will Be Paid Starting Today; Changed to Be Paid in Full in Chongqing</h3>
<p>In order to maintain credit, the Ministry of Finance approved the payment of the sixth installment of principal and interest of the five types of unified government bonds A, B, C, D, and E, which will be due at the end of this month, by the Central Bank and its entrusted China and Transportation Banks, but changed to be paid in full in Chongqing, and the rest of the places, such as Shanghai, will be repaid in six installments. The three banks in Shanghai, China, China, and Transportation, have been ordered to handle the installment payment procedures starting today. The installment payment forms have been printed. The payment is in legal tender, not remittance.</p>
<h3>Resumption of Postal Service in Anhui Province Must Be Postponed Again</h3>
<p>Currently, Only Wuhu and Bengbu Have Postal Service. The situation of resuming postal service in Anhui Province has now suffered a setback. According to personnel from the Postal Administration Office, the Postal Administration Bureau of Anhui Province withdrew to Shanghai after the fall of Anqing. It has been a long time since then. Although it has been planned to resume it again and again, it has not been realized. Recently, it was planned to leave for Anhui at the beginning of next month to make arrangements for the resumption of postal service. Now, there is another obstacle, so it will probably have to be postponed until mid-March before it can be realized. It has been found that the current postal service areas in Anhui Province are only Wuhu and Bengbu (both first-class post offices), which are temporarily transferred to the Jiangsu Administration Bureau for concurrent management, and the rest have not been posted. The postal pieces in Hankou are also limited to the urban area of Hankou, and the rest are suspended. At the same time, the economic income of the Shanghai Post Office is declining day by day. Among the various businesses, except for the telegraphic transfer, the rest are very deserted.</p>
<h3>工部局上月份　救火會報吿</h3>
<p>More than a hundred fire alarms, four major fires</p>
<p>According to the report of the Chairman of the Fire Brigade of the Public Works Department, during the month of December, the brigade received 114 fire alarms, including one malicious false alarm and six special alarms. The fires occurred within the Public Concession and in the Public Works Department's road areas outside the Concession.

The Fire Brigade's ambulance was dispatched 682 times in December, transporting a total of 720 patients to various hospitals.</p>

<p>Shanghai Special</p>
<h3>一年來之上海戰時物價（上）</h3>
<p>— 尹蘭</p>
<p>Shanghai's wartime prices in the past year (Part 1)</p>
<p>— Yin Lan</p>
<p>It has been more than a year since our army withdrew from Shanghai last November (26th year of the Republic). The price level is about one-third higher than before the war. During the second year of the European War, the price increases in the warring countries compared to before the war were similar, with France and Germany increasing by about 40 percent and Britain by about 27 percent. In terms of the market prices of major commodities, the fluctuations vary, and the reasons are also complex. Taking the period before the war, i.e., from June of last year to February of this year (27th year of the Republic), as the first phase, and from February of this year to the recent November as the second phase, the comparison is made in phases as shown in the table below: Percentage increase or decrease in Shanghai market prices (national currency yuan)</p>

<h3>花會頭目毛阿祥　公然設廠誘賭</h3>
<p>The head of the lottery syndicate, Mao Axiang, openly sets up a factory to lure gambling</p>
<p>Yiji branch factory raided by the police, four criminals arrested and sentenced separately</p>
<p>Guan Huchen, a detective of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, learned that a lottery branch factory, numbered Yongji, had been set up in an unnumbered bungalow bordering the Chinese area on Peace Road in western Shanghai. It was a branch of the Yiji lottery syndicate established by Mao Axiang and others in Caojiadu. Since the Public Concession police authorities had selectively blocked the traffic routes to opium dens in the western district, it had become inconvenient for those with these two habits in the Concession. Therefore, Mao Axiang set up a branch factory to attract more customers. Although the factory was located in a bungalow, the entrance was equipped with a drum-shaped lamp shade with the words "Yongji Lottery Agency Yiji Branch Factory" written in vermilion, which was very eye-catching. However, lottery operations have always been conducted in secret. To openly lure gambling like this was unprecedented. Guan Detective then reported to the police chief the day before yesterday and led Chinese Detective Tang Jian, Wu Chengmo, Western Detective and other officers to raid the factory. They arrested Zhang Zhilong, who was in charge of the branch factory's affairs, Ding Guoliang, who collected gambling money, and Shao Xiaodi and Zhang Lizhi, who kept accounts. They confiscated three glass signs, one with four lines of lottery riddles, one with lottery nicknames, one with winning lottery numbers, and more than 160 lottery slips, account books, and other gambling paraphernalia. They were taken back to the police station and sent to the First Special District Local Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the details of the case and stated that the main factory of the lottery syndicate was still run by Mao Axiang and Cao Hongsheng and was located on Rue Robert. Since the factory raided was a branch of their syndicate, the case was more serious than previous lottery cases, and the perpetrators should be severely punished. Judge Dai then questioned the four criminals one by one and, after clarifying the facts, sentenced Zhang Zhilong to one and a half years of imprisonment for repeated offenses, and Ding Guoliang, Shao Xiaodi, and Zhang Lizhi to eight months of imprisonment each. All confiscated items were also forfeited.</p>
<h3>夾底火油箱三隻　滿裝川土</h3>
<p>Three fuel tanks with false bottoms, filled with Sichuan opium</p>
<p>Motor vehicle transporting opium seized and intercepted</p>
<p>Xiong Youqing, a 31-year-old man from Hubei, was driving a car past the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue de l'Avenir at around 4:00 PM on the 28th of this month when he was stopped and searched by detectives. Xiong was carrying three fuel tanks. Upon inspection, it was discovered that the tanks had false bottoms, with the upper part of the three tanks filled with soybean oil and the lower part filled with opium. He was immediately taken back to the police station. The total weight of the opium was 39 pounds, all of which was Sichuan opium. When asked where the opium came from, he confessed that it was being delivered to the third floor of the Southeast Hotel on Rue de l'Avenir. Yesterday afternoon, he was sent to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Local Court and requested to be detained and investigated before being interrogated again. After Judge Liao Yuan questioned the defendant, he approved a postponement for further investigation and then interrogation. The defendant was taken into custody.</p>
<h3>馬育航被殺後　今日大殮</h3>
<p>Ma Yuhang's funeral held today after being murdered</p>
<p>The body has been claimed by his son, and the Japanese seem very concerned about this case</p>
<p>The details of Ma Yuhang being shot in the New Asia Hotel on the sixth floor the night before last and dying in the hospital were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Ma's body was sent from the hospital to the Jiaozhou Road morgue at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning. The police reported the case to the prosecutor's office of the First Special District Court, which appointed a prosecutor to inspect the scene. It was confirmed that Ma had been shot to death, and the death certificate was completed and handed over to the family for claiming the body. Ma's son, Siqi, immediately surrendered himself and claimed the body. After signing a guarantee, he hired the World Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road to transport the body to be washed and dressed at around 12:00 PM. The funeral was scheduled for 2:00 PM today at the funeral home, and the coffin will be temporarily stored there before being transported back to his hometown for burial at a later date. In addition, it is known that since Ma was killed, Japanese personnel in plain clothes went to the police station to inquire about the truth that night, as if they were very concerned about the case. As for the fugitive murderer, the search is still ongoing.</p>
<h3>公共租界捕房　弋獲土販</h3>
<p>Public Concession police capture opium dealers</p>
<p>One case has been sentenced, one case is awaiting investigation</p>
<p>On the day of January 28th, the Public Concession police authorities dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives in the Concession to check pedestrians in sections. The Central Police Station also stationed Chinese Detectives Tian Changyuan and No. 840 on the Henan Road Bridge, specializing in searching suspicious pedestrians. At 7:00 AM that morning, a taxi numbered 17723 sped from south to north. The detectives ordered the car to stop, but before the car could stop, a man in the car jumped out and fled. Although the detectives gave chase, they were unable to catch him. They arrested Su Aijian, a Guangdong woman left in the car, and after inspecting the car, found 63 taels of opium in a shoe box. They were taken back to the police station together. Under investigation, Su completely denied the accusation. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted her in accordance with Article 5 of the Anti-Opium Law. When questioned, Su still firmly denied that there was opium hidden in the car. After investigation by Judge Xiao, Su was found not guilty. Bail of 500 yuan was required during the appeal period, and the opium was confiscated.</p>
<p>Feng Xiushan and Liu Shaotian, Chinese Detectives of the Louza Police Station, inspected pedestrians at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Shanxi Road at 7:00 PM on the 29th of the month. They saw Wang Youzhang from Jiangyin coming in a rickshaw and went forward to search him. Chen Dalang, the owner of the Tiancheng Shoe Store, also from Jiangyin, suddenly stepped forward to prevent the search, and the detectives arrested him as well. Five and a half taels of heroin were found in a rattan basket on Wang's rickshaw. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted them in accordance with the law. After investigation by Judge Xiao, because further investigation was needed, he ordered a postponement for further questioning in one week.</p>
<h3>混用偽鈔　主夥被拘訊究</h3>
<p>Principal accomplice detained and questioned for using counterfeit money</p>
<p>Jiang Yonglin, an apprentice at the Xieshun Nanhua Store at No. 175 Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession, received a five-yuan counterfeit note from the Farmers Bank of China at the store counter the day before yesterday morning. Zhou Jiamu, the bookkeeper, discovered it. Because Jiang was unable to compensate for the loss, he ordered Jiang to take the counterfeit note to the Datong Nanhua Store on Rue du Marché to buy ten cans of milk that evening. He was discovered, and the police arrested Jiang and the counterfeit note. Because the store manager, Zong Jingsheng, was suspected of collusion, Zong was arrested. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the Second Special District Court and requested to be detained for investigation. Judge Liao Yuan presided over the interrogation in the Criminal Court. The shop assistant of the Datong Nanhua Store testified to the defendant's use of counterfeit money. Jiang and Zong admitted that they had received the counterfeit note in the morning and went to the Datong Store to buy goods. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning on February 3, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>燃燒煤球中毒</h3>
<p>Carbon monoxide poisoning from burning coal briquettes</p>
<p>Wu Zhangshi, a 22-year-old woman from Ningbo, who lived at No. 26 Yinhe Lane, Minquan Road in the French Concession, suffered carbon monoxide poisoning at around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday while burning a coal briquette stove for warmth in her bedroom. Because the doors and windows were tightly closed, she was poisoned by the coal. Her roommates discovered her and rushed her to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>The lawsuit over the Lao Da Fang trademark still requires investigation and is postponed for further questioning</p>
<p>Shen Hongjian, the manager of the Lao Da Fang teahouse and confectionery store at No. 378 Zhejiang Road, has been in business for many years and has flourished. To prevent counterfeiting, he registered the words "Lao Da Fang" with the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and the Bureau of Social Affairs. However, recently, the Lao Da Fang brand has been seen everywhere in the market. Shen hired Lawyer Mao Xianshen to publish warnings in the newspaper twice. Unexpectedly, Chen Jiruo, the manager of the Lao Da Fang Xiji at No. 542 Nanjing Road, the Lao Da Fang Xinhao at No. 290 Nanjing Road, and the Lao Da Fang Xiji at No. 34 Haig Road, saw the reports and believed that Shen Hongjian was deliberately defaming them. They hired Lawyers Wang Weizhen and Yin Shijie to file a criminal lawsuit against Shen in the First Special Court. After the court hearing, because Shen Hongjian had already filed a lawsuit in the civil court, the criminal case was suspended. Shen still hired Lawyer Mao Xianshen to file a civil lawsuit in the civil court against Lao Da Fang Xiji, Xinhao, Xiji (manager Chen Jiruo), Jianji at No. 34 Haig Road (manager Wang Jianzhong), Tianji at No. 9716 Jing'an Temple Road (manager Xia Xinzhi), etc., requesting that the defendants be ordered not to use Lao Da Fang as their business name in accordance with the Commercial Registration Law and its implementing regulations. After one hearing, Wang Weizhen, the lawyer for the defendant Chen Jiruo, argued that Lao Da Fang Xiji was established before the plaintiff and was not subject to commercial registration restrictions, and that the Haig Road branch was a branch of Xiji and was not subject to the relevant laws. The lawyer for the defendant in Jianquan stated that ordinary and similar store names that had been in use for a long time could not be registered unless they were separately marked. He recalled that the Ministry of Justice also had this explanation. The court ordered a postponement. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Tao continued the hearing. The plaintiff's lawyer Mao Xianshen made a statement. The defendant's lawyer Wang Weizhen presented the water and electricity deposit receipt of Lao Da Fang Xiji to prove that the store was indeed a branch of Xiji. However, after reviewing the receipt, Lawyer Mao stated that the receipt could only prove that Lao Da Fang Xiji had paid the deposit with shares from the power company, but it could not prove that the Haig Road branch was a branch of Xiji. Moreover, the plaintiff's business registration had been publicly announced and certified by the Trademark Bureau and the Bureau of Social Affairs, and others should not be allowed to use it. He requested that the court make a judgment in accordance with the law. Judge Tao stated that the case still required investigation and ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<h3>闢室振華旅館　聚賭抽頭</h3>
<p>The Zhenhua Hotel opens a room for gambling and takes a cut</p>
<p>Yuan Fugen sentenced to six months imprisonment, seventeen gamblers fined</p>
<p>Cao Qishan, a Chinese detective of the Louza Police Station, learned that many people were gathering to gamble and taking a cut in room 251 of the Zhenhua Hotel at No. 5, Lane 636, Fuzhou Road. At 12:30 AM the day before yesterday, he secretly went to arrest them with Western and Chinese detectives from the police station. They arrested Yuan Fugen, the boss, and Yang Fugen and other gamblers, a total of 18 people, and brought the gambling paraphernalia and money to the police station, where they were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted them for gambling and explained the case, requesting that they be punished. After Judge Fang Qinghuan questioned each defendant one by one, he sentenced Yuan Fugen to six months of imprisonment for repeated gambling, and the other 17 people, including Yang Fugen, were fined 20 yuan each for gambling. All gambling paraphernalia and money were confiscated.</p>

At 3:15 PM yesterday, her old illness suddenly relapsed. She first spoke incoherently and then used scissors to cut off both of her nipples, causing blood to flow profusely and fainting to the ground. Her family discovered her, immediately called an ambulance, and rushed her to the Shanghai East Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>自殺三起</h3>
<p>Three suicides</p>

He died upon arrival.</p>
<h3>偽「司法處」偽員　得賄放縱罪犯　偽「處長」竟不加深究</h3>
<p>Fake officials of the fake "Judicial Office" accept bribes to release criminals, and the fake "Director" does not investigate further</p>
<p>A scandal recently occurred in the fake "Municipal Government Judicial Office" in which fake officials accepted bribes to release criminals, involving internal fake "officials." After the case was discovered, the fake "Director" Wu Wenzhong protected his henchmen and only detained eight minor fake officials, without pursuing the matter further, showing the corruption of the fake organization. The incident started when Song Wenkui, a rogue from Yangzhou, only in his twenties, extorted money from boatmen and vegetable vendors upstream of the Suzhou River a few days ago. He was arrested by the fake "Police Station" and sent to the fake "Office" on Dongchang Road in Pudong for interrogation. After the "interrogation," he was sentenced to one year and three months of "imprisonment." After being sent to the fake "prison," Song and two other minor "offenders" (one named Chen Dezhou and one named Han) discussed a plan. They agreed that Han would take the opportunity of his early release to lobby the fake "warden" and fake "bailiff" on behalf of Song. Chen Dezhou, who was only sentenced to five days of imprisonment, was about to be released. At that time, Song would replace Chen's name and be released, and Chen would serve Song's sentence. Song would be responsible for Chen's household expenses every month during Chen's imprisonment. After the terms were agreed upon, 300 yuan was paid in bribes in advance, with the understanding that another 200 yuan would be bribed after "prison." When Chen's five-day sentence expired, Song replaced Chen's name and was released. The fake "judge" did not even examine the real and fake "offenders" and was successfully fooled. The so-called golden cicada escape plan was sold. Several days later, Han, acting on Song's orders, took Song's note to the fake "Office" in Pudong to continue negotiations and paid another 200 yuan in bribes. Unexpectedly, the matter was discovered by the fake "judge," who detained Han. Han confessed that the bribe recipients were the fake "warden," the fake "detention center director," the fake "bailiff" Zhang Si, and more than ten fake "bailiffs." Han also revealed Song's address, and Song was arrested. After clarifying the truth, in addition to continuing to detain Song and Han, the fake "Director" Wu Wenzhong abused his personal feelings and only recorded a major demerit for the fake "prison official" and the fake "detention center director" without removing them from their posts for investigation. However, the eight fake "bailiffs" were dismissed and detained because they had no backing to speak for them.</p>
<h3>浪漫女子程瑛　控夫傷害判决</h3>
<p>Romantic woman Cheng Ying sues her husband for assault, verdict</p>
<p>Zhao Liyuan fined twenty yuan</p>
<p>Cheng Ying, a graduate of a midwifery school from Changshu, posted an advertisement in a local newspaper for friends after divorcing Dr. Wei Guangcai in September of the year before last. The advertisement stated that the ability to bear financial burdens was a qualification. Zhao Liyuan, the owner of the Liyuan Well Drilling Company at No. 596 Hai Fang Road, from Jiangyin, saw the advertisement and responded. They hit it off immediately and began living together. But in less than two years, a rift developed. Cheng hired a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit against Zhao Liyuan in the First Special Court for seduction, assault, and obstructing freedom. The Special Court held two hearings, and the defendant also presented evidence and many tabloid reports to prove that Cheng Ying was a romantic woman who had married multiple times. The defendant claimed that he had been deceived this time. After the court debate concluded, the case was adjourned for sentencing. The details were reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Peishen of the Criminal Court announced the verdict, which stated: "Zhao Liyuan is fined twenty yuan for assaulting a person's body. If he is unable to pay, he shall be sentenced to one day of labor for every two yuan. He is not guilty of the remaining charges."</p>

<h3>A Passenger on the Hesheng Wheel - Concealing a Huge Amount of Morphine - Seized by Detectives After Landing</h3>
<p>Yesterday at around 10:00 AM, the Hesheng steamboat sailed from another port to Shanghai, docking at Wharf No. 3 of the Roosevelt Dock on the Bund in the French Concession (formerly the Jinliyuan China Merchants Bureau Dock). Afterwards, a passenger, a man surnamed Jia from Shandong, walked ashore alone. He happened to encounter Chinese and foreign detectives dispatched by the French Concession police to inspect pedestrians. Jia, seeing the detectives from afar, panicked and turned to flee. The detectives caught up and searched him, finding 150 packets of morphine, each weighing about one tael, with a total value of about 30,000 yuan, in the interlayer of the cotton-padded jacket Jia was wearing. When asked where he had brought the drugs from and where he was taking them, Jia was evasive. He was taken back to the police station along with the evidence to await investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Good Coupon Committee Regularly Allocates - The Fifth Term Relief Fund</h3>
<p>Nine-tenths Used for Relief of Chinese Refugees</p>
<p>After the drawing of the fifth term of the French Concession Relief Lottery for Refugees Charity was held in public at Yiyuan last month on the 12th, all large and small winning prizes have been successively cashed. It is learned that the Relief Fund Allocation Committee of the lottery, Father Zhao, Feng Zhenduo, Chassber, Li Guiyong, Palento, Pullen, Yan Huiqing, An Xianjin, Jones, McKnodon, Pide Tuo, etc., in order to quickly conclude the allocation of the fifth term prize money, has scheduled to hold the fifth term relief fund committee meeting this week at the lottery headquarters on Guangdong Road. It is reported that nine-tenths will be used for relief of Chinese refugees and one-tenth will be used for relief of foreign refugees.</p>
<h3>French Concession Water and Electricity Company - Public Banquet for Fu Liangjun</h3>
<p>Mr. Fu Liangjun, manager of the Xinguang Underwear Factory, is young and promising. In addition to managing the affairs of the entire factory, he also works in the Vehicle Department of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company in this port. Recently, because the Xinguang standard shirts produced by the factory have been selling well and the business is becoming increasingly busy, it is difficult for him to handle both. He specifically resigned from the French Concession Water and Electricity Company. Mr. Fu is proficient in mathematics and efficient in handling affairs. The company relies on him heavily, and the colleagues have a particularly harmonious relationship. Therefore, they have repeatedly tried to retain him earnestly. However, Mr. Fu's determination to leave is firm. The colleagues in the Vehicle Department of the company held a public banquet for Mr. Fu at the factory yesterday afternoon to express their feelings of parting.</p>
<h3>Savings Bicycle Service Society - Relocates to New Address for Service</h3>
<p>The Savings Bicycle Service Society was organized by Tu Jianmin and others, former dispatch riders of the International Radio Station and the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau. The society's purpose is to serve the community, work hard, and support themselves. They charge only 1 jiao and 5 fen per hour for purchasing and delivering items for customers. If they are entrusted to deliver gifts and the recipient needs help carrying them, they do not charge extra. The society's original address was No. 1, Lane 210, Kaifeng Road. Due to the inconvenience of transportation there, and to meet the needs of all sectors, they relocated yesterday to No. 4, Yanqingli, Lane 835, North Chengdu Road, Shanhai Pass Road, and have a telephone, No. 36519. If people from all walks of life need to entrust the society to handle matters, simply make a phone call, and they will immediately send someone to provide loyal service.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association, in view of the sharp increase in population and the increasing number of tuberculosis patients in this city since the "August 13th Incident", has raised funds to open a tuberculosis hospital at No. B37 Bailinan Road, providing free treatment to benefit tuberculosis-stricken compatriots, in order to ensure social safety and public health. Recently, in view of the fact that tuberculosis patients from the middle class and above are struggling financially and lack access to treatment, and because the Shanghai International Red Cross Society Second Hospital at No. 172 Qiqi Road was closing down, the association took over and reorganized the hospital, renaming it Shanghai Hospital. In addition to opening a tuberculosis ward, etc., to accommodate tuberculosis patients, it also established general wards and an outpatient department to meet social needs. It is reported that the hospital is well-equipped, with two of the latest X-ray machines, as well as artificial sun lamps, thermal lamps, and various surgical instruments. The environment is quiet and suitable for recuperation, and the fees are low. Preparations have been completed, and the hospital will begin admitting patients and officially open on February 1st.</p>
<h3>"Tears Sprinkled on Flowers" Performance Scheduled</h3>
<p>The long-promoted stage play "Tears Sprinkled on Flowers" is the masterpiece of the Shanghai Drama Society, written by Yu Ling and directed by Wu Yonggang. The play is scheduled to premiere on February 7th at the Carlton Theater. Matinee performances will be added on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<h3>Telegram Code Translation</h3>
<p>Day and Night Service for Convenience and Speed</p>
<p>Currently, telegrams to and from the Telegraph Bureau are not translated by specialists. Each telegram is sent out in its original code without being translated into text. Outgoing telegrams must also be translated into code by the sender before they will be accepted and sent, which is very inconvenient. Now, Mr. Zhang and several others, formerly of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, have established a telephone translation telegram code service to facilitate the rapid receipt, dispatch, and translation of telegrams for all sectors. The fees are low and the service is attentive. The office is currently located at No. 5, Lane 44, Jiangxi Road, telephone number 10157. When you receive a telegram, please dial the above telephone number, and they will explain and inquire about each number in the telegram one by one. The office will immediately reply over the phone. Telegrams to be sent to various places can also be translated into code by the office and sent on your behalf. Then, you can come and collect the above fees based on the receipt from the telegraph bureau. The office has a brochure, which will be sent upon request. This is also one of Shanghai's emerging businesses.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: According to Mr. Zhong Xinfu, the person concerned, the news item in the Shen Bao news column on the 23rd of this month, "Zhong Xinfu Denies Nephew", was inaccurate. After the death of his father, he was heavily in debt. Thanks to the assistance of his father's old friends, he was able to make a dangerous situation into a safe one. This shows how difficult the family's financial situation was at the time. How could the Zhong family have any assets? As for his younger brother Liangfu, when he was 21 years old, his mother, in view of the poor family situation, arranged for her second son to find a way out and allowed him to be adopted into the Shen family as a son-in-law. The Shen family immediately adopted him as their heir. The year after Liangfu was adopted, he had a son named Pinfang, who became the Shen family's grandson. Therefore, his enrollment, employment, and marriage were all as Shen Pinfang. To avoid outsiders misunderstanding the truth, he specifically requested that we send a letter on his behalf to make a correction. We are responding to the situation and sending a letter on his behalf as above. Please publish it in the corrections column. Thank you. Sincerely, Lawyer Zhang Shanle, January 30, 28th year of the Republic.</p>

<h3>"Setting a Bamboo Shoot Head"</h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>"Setting a bamboo shoot head" is a term from a certain society, and its meaning is "framing".</p>
<p>Eastern carpenters still use ancient techniques to this day. For example, master carpenters building houses and small carpenters making utensils are reluctant to use iron screws. Instead, they prefer to spend more time sawing and chiseling the wood into concave and convex shapes in order to construct the buildings. The convex shape is called the "bamboo shoot head". Therefore, the work of setting the bamboo shoot heads is extremely important for building houses and making utensils. In other words, a house or utensil cannot be successfully built without setting the bamboo shoot heads.</p>
<p>Old friends in a certain society, in order to achieve their extortionist goals or seize the possessions of others, in addition to resorting to intimidation, must also use their brains, change their minds, and come up with eighteen twisted arguments, because simple intimidation will incur the condemnation of the general public. Thus, they make something out of nothing, using false accusations; some "mourning parties" even go so far as to "open the heavenly gate" and destroy their own faces in order to achieve their schemes. This style, this method, is called "setting a bamboo shoot head" in a certain society.</p>
<p>We once said that Shanghai people are very clever, not only are they highly receptive, but they are also very quick to spread information. Shanghai people not only understand this term, but also use it. However, because they lack innate talent, although they understand the meaning of "setting a bamboo shoot head" and can use the phrase "setting a bamboo shoot head," they are still clumsy in implementing it, making it easy for others to see the flaws. They are not as mature and skilled as our eastern neighbor, the "friendly nation."</p>
<p>According to a report from Hong Kong on the 24th in this newspaper, a person from Tianjin said that the assassinations of Liu Datong, Wang Zhulin, Jin Bidong, Kawashima Yoshiko, etc., that recently occurred in the French Concession of Tianjin were all committed by the Japanese themselves. The Japanese intended to use this as a way to coerce the Concession authorities, blaming them for harboring anti-Japanese elements, and demanding the inspection or blockade of the British and French Concessions. This is the latest example of the Japanese implementing "setting a bamboo shoot head."</p>
<p>As for the eastern "friendly nation's" diplomacy towards China, it has consistently adopted a "setting a bamboo shoot head" policy. If you don't believe it, please look through the history of Sino-Japanese diplomacy, which is filled with stories of "setting bamboo shoot heads" and being "set with bamboo shoot heads." It can also be said that Japan's diplomatic history with China is nothing more than a success story of "setting bamboo shoot heads."</p>
<p>Yes, the eastern "friendly nation" has succeeded in "setting bamboo shoot heads," but they have forgotten that the failure of "setting bamboo shoot heads" is in encountering the other party's "not picking up the pot" and "not buying the story." China's rise to resist Japan is a concrete manifestation of "not picking up the pot" and "not buying the story." When the fascist ogres try to set a question to "set a bamboo shoot head," the democratic countries such as Britain, France, and the United States should use the method of resisting Japan to deal with this slanderous and vile behavior, and smash the fascist ogres' conspiracy of "setting a bamboo shoot head."</p>
<h3>School Fees More Urgent Than Debt</h3>
<p>— Yanran</p>
<p>Because I cannot implement the method of Japanese congressmen and cut off my only "reproductive glands," I have given birth to two "debt-collecting ghosts." Now that I have children, I cannot help but send them to school when they reach school age. Therefore, the school fee for each semester is truly enough to make me, the father who maintains life by using his brains, feel great difficulty and financial strain.</p>
<p>The calendar on the desk is turned over page by page. Oh no! The start of school on February 1st is coming soon again! These days, a nine-year-old child took the "four-part form" from school and gave it to me, telling me to send the school fees to the bank immediately. I took it and looked at it, and it was terrible. The fees to be paid by a primary school student who is just in the second grade are: tuition 16 yuan, textbooks 2 yuan, miscellaneous fees 1 yuan and 5 jiao, construction fees 1 yuan and 5 jiao, totaling 21 yuan in silver dollars. I couldn't help but gasp, and then looked down at the "four-part form." In the notes column, it was clearly printed: "If school fees are not paid before the start of school, the admission certificate will be withheld: after the start of school, a late payment of one day will be fined one yuan. If the fees are still not paid after one week, the student will be expelled." Alas! The school authorities have a stern face and are unwilling to be accommodating at all. Not a penny can be missing. It really leaves parents with no way out. I never thought that in this year, in addition to the "difficulty of making a living," there is even more "difficulty of children going to school." As people used to say, "Human sentiment is as big as debt," now it has become "school fees are more urgent than debt." How can one not be filled with emotion?</p>
<p>However, having said that, since children are born, they naturally have to study; if they want to go to school, then the school fees naturally have to be paid. However, I sincerely request the principals of the schools to fulfill their responsibilities and inspire their conscience after receiving the students' school fees, and not to think that once the money is in their pockets, they can be "satisfied"; they must give the payers a fair price. Otherwise, it would be too unfair to the parents who work hard and scrape together to pay for their children's school fees.</p>
<h3>After Viewing the "American Art School Painting Exhibition":</h3>
<p>— Yi Pin</p>
<p>Several art exhibitions have already been held at the Da Sun Company and the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, with a continuous stream of visitors. However, antiques account for nine out of ten of the paintings and calligraphy on display. As for new paintings - "oil paintings", "watercolors", "pencil drawings" - people of older age exclaim with a sigh: "Is this what they call painting?!"</p>
<p>Now, the American Art School appears in a brand new posture on the fourth floor of the Da Sun Company. If you have the time to visit, you will definitely find it very satisfying.</p>
<p>As I excitedly signed my name at the entrance and walked in, I was presented with six large oil paintings, "Refugee Exodus". As I looked at them one by one, scenes of cruel refugee life seemed to float into my mind.</p>
<p>Isn't this one preparing to pack up and flee? They are about to leave their beloved hometown and the farmland where they eke out a living.</p>
<p>And in another one, look, a refugee woman is sitting by the roadside, covering her face with her hands and sobbing. Isn't the corpse lying on the ground in front of her her son?</p>
<p>People living in Shanghai only know about the refugees in the shelters, but the situation they encountered before can be completely told to you here.</p>
<p>"Light Will Come" is extremely well painted. In a corner of an open space, a man and a woman, with the man pointing ahead, as if saying, "The light is coming!" However, the color of the place he is pointing to is somewhat dim, which is too inappropriate (this is my personal opinion). The artist cannot be known.</p>
<p>There is a watercolor painting called "Refugees". The most unbearable thing is the pair of small feet of the old woman, which makes people angry. Foreigners used to insult us with small feet, but now it is our own work. It would be best to improve it as much as possible.</p>
<p>This "American Art School" painting exhibition is quite a success.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Wu Peifu's Late-Life Integrity</h3>
<p>— Jin Taipu</p>
<p>The fascist demon of the Far East truly knows how to play tricks. Not long ago, he instigated the peace movement through Wang Jingwei, attempting to undermine our established national policy of resistance. However, with the surge of national sentiment, Wang's telegram became a damp squib, and Wang Jingwei became a traitor stripped bare. The first trick failed. Konoe's cabinet collapsed, followed by a minor ploy, hoping that Prime Minister Chamberlain, after consulting with Germany and Italy, would also consult with Japan, the "third brother" of the East. But the two elder brothers in the West were far more prestigious, and Prime Minister Chamberlain ultimately did not grant this favor. It failed again. Then came the third trick, inviting Wu Peifu to serve as the chairman of the Pacification Committee of Kaifeng, hoping to connect the puppet regimes of the North and South.</p>
<p>Wu Peifu is a famous hardliner. Although he was an old warlord in the past, he often compared himself to Guan Yu and Yue Fei, especially after his military defeat, boasting that he would not seek shelter with foreigners. Recently, Lieutenant General Doihara, a butcher famous for massacring Chinese people, has repeatedly enticed him. Wu Peifu has consistently and sternly refused, even swearing by his coffin. Outsiders believe that Doihara's skills have been exhausted!</p>
<p>But Wu Peifu is ultimately like a priceless antique. The "Jiangxi people" are unwilling to let him go. The harder he resists, the more fiercely they entice him. Now, they are attempting to create a fait accompli by using the title of Chairman of the Pacification Committee of Kaifeng to establish a predetermined reality. They are publicizing it in advance, hoping that in the eyes of the invaders, they can turn falsehood into truth!</p>
<p>However, Wu Peifu's life achievements are not particularly commendable. Only his backbone is indeed more self-respecting than that of Wang Jingwei and his ilk! Moreover, Wu Peifu is also stripped bare. Learning from Wang Jingwei's example, he would be sacrificing his clean reputation in his later years! Allowing the enemies of the nation to violate his Guan Yu and Yue Fei beliefs, and the puppet official career he would gain in return would not be promising. Wu Peifu must ask himself if he is not a fool, not suffering from temporary mental derangement, he would never be so muddled.</p>
<h3>Song of the Colt Shadow</h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>Paramount Pictures Production, Grand Theater Premiere</p>
<p>"Song of the Colt Shadow" (Sing You Sinners) is another film with singing and horse racing as its theme. However, it seems slightly different from other films with the same theme. The difference lies in the author's emphasis on the depiction of human emotions. Therefore, it is much more appealing compared to those films that focus solely on horse racing and singing. Admittedly, the insertion of several singing scenes still feels abrupt, but it is much more reasonable.</p>
<p>Therefore, rather than watching those inexplicable musical films, I would rather watch something like "Song of the Colt Shadow," a musical film without grand spectacles.</p>
<p>The story of "Song of the Colt Shadow" is not particularly convoluted or moving. What I like about it is the human touch. The joy of the Davis family when they hear that their second son, Joey, has found work at a gas station, contrasted with Joey's unemployment and return home, is a good contrast. "Where the bourgeoisie has got the upper hand, it has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his 'natural superiors,' and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous 'cash payment.' The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation." Although "Song of the Colt Shadow" does not intentionally write about this iron law, it ruthlessly proves its correctness. In the reality where family relations become "cash payment," the pitiful Davises and their family play a tragicomic role in it. "Song of the Colt Shadow," on the surface, is a comedy with singing and dancing, but if we carefully savor and analyze it, it is a tragicomedy that small citizens in bourgeois society often play. It is precisely because of this point that we find "Song of the Colt Shadow" more commendable than ordinary musical films.</p>
<p>The director's handling of this film has its merits, especially in the relationships between the Davis family members, and in their joys and angers, he is able to grasp the "capriciousness of the small citizen class's tragicomedy"—which is determined by society for them.</p>
<p>However, although the director has this advantage, he cannot solidify it. He only scratches the surface and does not satisfy the audience.</p>
<p>I like most of the actors in this film. Florine McKinney, Donald O'Connor, Elisabeth Patterson, Ellen Drew are all good. Ellen Drew is still a newcomer, and although her role is not important, she shows promise in the scene where she returns from the small bar with Joey. She is a bit sweet, and her style is somewhat similar to Irene Dunne, but she is more innocent than Irene Dunne.</p>
<p>However, Bing Crosby is not particularly good. I find his silly appearance a bit annoying. The songs are also very bland.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Viewing the Portrait and Remembering the Old Righteous Man, the Little Teacher Opens the Letter for the Illiterate</p>
<p>Jin Danyun said: "What is even more is that things originally possessed by the Chinese are said to be backward, but when they are brought in from foreign countries, they are thought to be fashionable and modern, which is truly ridiculous. I remember my old lady once said that when she was fourteen or fifteen years old, young girls were popular for dyeing their fingernails red. They used balsam flowers mashed up, adding some non-fading materials, and dyed them on their fingernails, thinking it was beautiful. Later, when girls all went to school, this fad was no longer popular, and anyone who dyed their fingernails red would be laughed at as being backward. Who knew that later, something suddenly became popular from Europe and the United States in China, a nail polish called 'Cutex.' For a time, young wives and young ladies seemed to go crazy, everyone dyeing their ten fingers bright red, as if they had grabbed a handful of blood. What does this mean? In short, Chinese women worship Western material things and only know how to blindly follow. Later, after repeated warnings from women's improvement associations, they said that women who painted their fingers with Cutex were indicating that they were lazy women. Because Heaven has endowed people with hands, originally to teach you to work, not to teach you to make decorations. If you paint them so red, it is obvious that you are sitting around all day, doing nothing. In this way, things gradually changed, and with women in our country each having their own careers, that kind of idle wind naturally gradually disappeared. Now, we can take the strengths of advanced European and American countries and discard their weaknesses, knowing what to choose for ourselves. We are neither as deeply resentful of foreigners as we were at first, nor as everything-is-good about foreigners as we were later. This is correct." Lin Jiancheng said, "Alright! We've finished eating and expressed our opinions. Let's go. Are we going to the park now? Or somewhere else?" Because Lin Jiancheng and Jin Danyun were frequent visitors, they now had to ask the two He family ladies where they would like to go. They wanted to take a walk in the park, so Lin and Jin accompanied them to the park. Originally, this park was also called Lingcun Park. Although it was very spacious, with the cemetery of the martyrs in the center, many places were not fully equipped. This is because the person in charge adopted an advanced approach. Built at the same time as this park was a museum. That museum was not an ordinary museum, but a museum commemorating the martyrs. Here, everything related to the martyrs, which is worth commemorating, is preserved inside. In addition, there are many spoils of war on display, such as diaries, booklets, Buddhist amulets, "thousand-stitch belts," and photos of wives and daughters found on enemy soldiers. (27)</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Talking About "Good Reportage Literature"</h3>
<p>— Qin Lao</p>
<p>A few days ago, in "Free Talk," Mr. Fei Bai had an article discussing reportage literature, saying that because he had read Sinclair's "No Pasaran," he "couldn't help but feel a little ashamed," because "in the past eighteen months," we had "hardly seen any good reportage literature." This is indeed the actual situation, not at all "negating" it. However, this aroused a bit of my opinion.</p>
<p>Several years ago, some critics once advocated that writers could fire a gun in one hand and write a novel in the other. But in the end, such a genius did not appear, proving that it was just critics daydreaming. Naturally, there were writers in legends who could compose poetry on horseback, but composing poetry is possible, writing novels is not, and the poems composed would not be "great" poems either. The reason is very simple: novels most need what Mr. Fei Bai calls "artistic description," and for writers to truly do the work of "description," they need some factual conditions.</p>
<p>Barbusse's "Under Fire" was not written during the Great War; Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front" was not written during the Great War. Take the current Spanish War as an example. Writers who have always stayed in Spain have not written a "masterpiece of reportage literature" like "No Pasaran." The famous Dutch writer Jef Last went to Spain to participate in the war, but only wrote a few letters—naturally, that can be said to be "good reportage literature," but it is also not a "masterpiece of reportage literature" like "No Pasaran."</p>
<p>Even if it is not "great" reportage literature, it still has to go through the two processes of general writing: first, there must be "reportage" material. Of course, material is everywhere now, but then there must be some time to sit down and write "literature," in Mr. Fei Bai's words, some time to not "write with a flowing pen." This is not the "treating literature as a mysterious thing" that critics daydreaming several years ago attacked, but a real fact. If literature could be written without a little time to sit down, then it would truly be a "mysterious thing." There are naturally some writers living in Shanghai and Hong Kong now, and they may have time to write in peace, but that is after all a minority, and they may not all be people who have always specialized in "literary" writing. As I see it, literary writers who have honestly participated in the war "for eighteen months" certainly have inexhaustible materials, but the time to sit down must be very short.</p>
<p>I am not saying that current reportage literature should be "like a running account, lacking artistic description, lacking moving power" (please let critics who love to put hats on people not be so quick to put the "pessimism" hat on me, okay?). I am just saying that we should not be too harsh on writers who are running on the battlefront. It is of course best to have a "masterpiece of reportage literature" like "No Pasaran," but if there is none, as long as there are true letters, true chronicles, as long as literary techniques are still used, and as long as it is not a bad work, then it can be tentatively considered passable reportage literature. It is of course best if those works can be "vivid" and "wonderful," but there is also a factual problem here: those who have been able to honestly participate in the war "for eighteen months" are probably mostly young writers. In addition to the difficulty of getting a little time to sit down in life, their writing skills are generally inevitably a little worse. However, old writers are often unwilling to roll around like them, or because they want to prepare for future "masterpieces," they do not care about writing those letters and chronicles. This is something that cannot be helped. Therefore, we can only temporarily satisfy ourselves with those works that are not "vivid" and not "wonderful." But this is only temporary: those writers will soon use their moving lives to turn their "stories" "under the pen" into "vivid" and "wonderful."</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that if one "cannot help but feel a little ashamed" because one has "hardly seen any good reportage literature," then one should not be "ashamed" for general writers in general, but one should be "ashamed" for a few old writers. (Here, I will preemptively leave a sentence to answer another counter-question: if I am also a writer, and if I can also be called old, I admit that I am one that cannot escape)</p>
<p>As for Mr. Fei Bai saying that there are too many "records of visiting generals and the like," I think this is a practical piece of advice. Taking a photo with a general, asking the general to write a few words or a poem, then composing one yourself, and then solemnly producing it in copperplate, the result is all unrelated to reportage literature. "Visits" are naturally important, but I think it is best to ask the soldiers more. More important material can certainly be obtained from the soldiers' surroundings, and that material will certainly enable the visitor to write "good reportage literature"—although it will not necessarily be "great reportage literature."</p>
<h3>Crossing the Wo River</h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>——Memories of the Breakout from Xuzhou</p>
<p>A few stars were scattered sparsely in the sky. A crescent moon rose from behind the woods, and the ground was covered with a mercury-like clear glow. The wheat seedlings had lost their tender greenness and vitality, and lay peacefully in the fields. Treading on the tree shadows that looked like light ink paintings reflected on the road, the team moved silently and quickly forward. In the villages near and far, there were occasional barks of dogs, as if enemies had passed through there.</p>
<p>With a tense heart ready to fight at any moment, I followed excitedly, wondering when we would pass through safely? It was said that there were several small villages scattered along the road where the enemy was lying in ambush.</p>
<p>The next morning, as the sun emitted its golden rays, the team reached the Xin Ting Road. To prevent enemy tanks from rushing in, the road had been dug up section by section. At this time, several civilians who heard that our team was going to pass this road were automatically digging earth to fill in the dug-up pits.</p>
<p>Touched by that rare enthusiasm, Commander Zhang took out thirty yuan and handed it to them:</p>
<p>"You've worked hard. Take this money and buy something to eat."</p>
<p>"You're helping us fight XX, how can we take your money?" The civilians clutched their hoes, smiling and refusing.</p>
<p>"Don't be polite!" Commander Zhang handed the money to a civilian. "Hurry up and dig, our heavy artillery is coming up behind us."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes." The civilians nodded and raised their hoes to dig.</p>
<p>Not far from the civilians, one or two vendors were selling a little paper cigarettes and the like by the roadside. At this time, the brothers who had retreated from southern Shandong and had not seen a civilian selling anything seemed to have seen some treasure, and they surrounded it in layers, vying to buy it. That rare bustle must have surprised the paper cigarette vendors!</p>
<p>After climbing over Long Mountain, which lay abruptly in the fields, we arrived at Longshan Town. The civilians standing by the street looked at us with a face full of fear, as if asking us if we were the enemy?</p>
<p>"Fellow villagers, don't be afraid! We are here to fight XX."</p>
<p>"Ah, you've worked hard!" A middle-aged man turned around and shouted to his family, "Don't be afraid, they are our troops, here to fight XX for us, hurry up and bring tea!"</p>
<p>"No need for tea, fellow villagers, just give us a drink of cold water!"</p>
<p>"Okay, bring out a bucket of cold water!"</p>
<p>Two tightly closed doors opened, and a little girl came out carrying a bucket of cold water. Then, this family and that family also opened their doors, carrying water out to comfort us.</p>
<p>Just sitting in front of a house drinking water, suddenly, an enemy plane flew over our heads and circled. The people and horses standing in the street hurriedly hid in people's homes. The enemy plane strafed with its machine gun for a while, and then flew away on its own without any result.</p>
<p>After resting in Longshan Town for a while, the team set off again under the fiery sun. There was no wind at all, and people were sweating profusely, and even their clothes were soaked with sweat.</p>
<p>Dragging a pair of feet that were soaked and rotten with yellow water, I walked laboriously on the scorching highway, thinking that we could satisfy our hunger for more than ten days when we reached Guoyang. Unexpectedly, when we reached Guoyang, the thousands upon thousands of houses had been bombed into scorched earth by enemy planes. Some of the houses were still emitting residual smoke, and the eyes were full of crying ruins and broken wood. There was not a single civilian. Ah, what shall we use to repay our enemies for this great feat of destruction?</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sound of machine guns rang out from behind. No need to tell: our brothers behind us must have come into contact with the enemy again!</p>
<p>The people and horses who had just arrived in Guoyang jumped into the overflowing Wo River one by one, wetting their clothes with water, wading across the Wo River, and then scattered and squatted in the trenches on the high ground outside the city...</p>
<p>Strangely, the sound of gunfire suddenly subsided.</p>
<h3>International Crisis</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>In German Concentration Camps (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Wan</p>
<p>Saying a few careless words in front of a close friend unexpectedly subjected me to seven months of terrifying detention by the Nazis. As a result, my weight decreased by forty pounds, and their power even trampled on my hometown.</p>
<p>When I was visiting my sister-in-law in Gotha-Reispai, I met an elderly woman who seemed very sympathetic to us when she heard that my wife and I were planning to move to the United States again to live. I earned some money by broadcasting on the radio, but recently, Goebbels' propaganda machine forbade me from being a performer, mainly because one of my ancestors seventy-five years ago married a Jew because of lack of foresight (?).</p>
<p>"Your unemployment is really unfortunate," a friend who came to visit my sister-in-law said. "Although you sing very well, you can only sing German songs!" She glanced at the wall, then half-smilingly pointed to Hitler's portrait, the most ardent insulter of the Jews.</p>
<p>"Alas, a performer!" I sighed sadly. My career as a performer is over!</p>
<p>Early one morning six days later, in my Munich residence, my wife and I were suddenly awakened by urgent knocking on the door. I opened the door, and two men in the well-known uniform stood in front of the door.</p>
<p>"Get dressed quickly and come with us!" they shouted wildly.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"You are not allowed to do anything anymore!"</p>
<p>I comforted my wife, telling her that I would probably be back in about an hour, but who knew that this was the last time I would see my wife for seven months! At the headquarters, I found that the woman who seemed to sympathize with me earlier was actually a Nazi Party member, and she felt that she had accomplished a task by reporting my mocking actions to the secret police.</p>
<p>In the next ten days, I saw the miserable inside story of four of the many prisons in Munich. The single-person cell that could only accommodate seven prisoners was now filled with twenty prisoners. One day, I asked the jailer about a question that often came to my mind: when can I be tried?</p>
<p>"Tried?" A ghostly person said angrily: "I have been waiting here for trial for nearly two years. I have been unemployed for a year since I joined the labor camp, and they insisted that they found a Communist newspaper in my labor utensils. In fact, I can tell you that I have never had this newspaper! I have been imprisoned here for two years without being tried!"</p>
<p>We had to scold him because he was speaking too loudly.</p>
<p>Another prisoner was a black-short-trousered guy from the fascist organization—the Schutzstaffel. He had been a guard at that terrible concentration camp outside Munich—Texas. All the friends he released to come here could see the terror that had intimidated everything in their eyes. To avoid more painful punishment, no one dared to tell his every horrible experience. The black-short-trousered kid had been detained in a Munich prison for two years for passing two cigarettes to the prisoner from Texas.</p>
<h3>Song of Winter</h3>
<p>— Keting</p>
<p>Winter,</p>
<p>I sing of it.</p>
<p>Mad snow,</p>
<p>Storms,</p>
<p>How can they hinder the coming of spring?</p>
<p>The suburbs are a scene of desolation:</p>
<p>White clouds hang low,</p>
<p>Endless withered grass,</p>
<p>Bird tracks and beast footprints trample the earth.</p>
<p>Spring is the herald of life,</p>
<p>Winter will be the advance whip of the herald.</p>
<p>The haze is the bridge to clarity,</p>
<p>Winter will be the base point of the bridge.</p>
<p>If you do not traverse the arduous journey,</p>
<p>How can you reach the glorious shore?</p>
<p>Winter,</p>
<p>I sing of it.</p>
<p>Coldness, trembling, I have no share in them,</p>
<p>My heart is full of warmth.</p>

<p>Entertainment World</p>
<h3>Silver Screen News</h3>
<p>— An Ran</p>
<p>Recently, among reports about movie news, three things seem worth mentioning:</p>
<p>(1) Central Propaganda Department Seeks Scripts on Atrocities: The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee, in order to understand the truth about the atrocities of the Japanese army in various guerrilla areas, is specifically advertising for such scripts to be filmed and shown in the interior, so that the people in the interior can deeply understand the truth of the Japanese army in the occupied areas, as well as a glimpse of their atrocities, thereby enhancing the national consciousness and anti-Japanese awareness of the general public. It is said that a total of three scripts will be selected, with a prize of 300 yuan for the first place, 200 yuan for the second place, and 100 yuan for the third place. The deadline is March 31st of this year. Many playwrights in this city have already written manuscripts to apply. To avoid censorship, they are all entrusted to people to send them to Hong Kong and then mailed from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>(2) Film Industry Refuses to Cooperate with the Japanese: Iwai Aya, the president of the Japanese International Film News, is actively operating in this city, intending to ask various film companies to transport domestic films to various guerrilla areas for screening; at the same time, he also has the intention of seizing the Shanghai film censorship rights. However, the film industry in this city is deeply aware of the righteousness, and no matter how difficult or hard the environment is, they will never cooperate with the Japanese. Therefore, although the Japanese have repeatedly entertained the authorities of various film companies, there have been no results. It is said that the Japanese side once proposed that the film authorities produce films on their behalf; and the authorities of various companies replied: "As far as the company is concerned, it is acceptable to produce films on behalf of others, as long as a considerable price is obtained; however, the facilities of each company after the war must first be decided by all the staff, so the first step is to seek the consent of all the staff." This firm expression of refusal to cooperate is a particularly glorious page in the Shanghai film industry, and it is admirable in the process of national resistance.</p>
<p>(3) "Charlie Chaplin Arrives in Shanghai" Nearing Completion: Playwright Li Amao (also known as the humorous novelist Xu Zhuodai) has recently been commissioned by the Star Film Company to write a film script with "humor as the warp" and "anti-Japanese war as the weft," titled "Charlie Chaplin Arrives in Shanghai." Now, Dr. Amao is taking advantage of this school winter vacation opportunity to step up his work. The manuscript will be completed soon. The materials he collected are very humorous, making people laugh until their stomachs hurt. It is expected that it may be released in the spring of March or April. At that time, it will surely cause a sensation among the movie fans in the "isolated island," who will be eager to see it first.</p>
<h3>Yu Zhenting's Death and Brief Biography</h3>
<p>— (Master of Guihua Hall)</p>
<p>This year is the year of death in the Peking opera world. Many contemporary famous actors have passed away one after another, including Yang Xiaolou and Wang Youchen. Now, news has come that Yu Zhenting, a famous martial artist of a generation, passed away at his home in Baishun Hutong, Qianmenwai, Beijing, on the 21st of this month, at the age of 60. According to Yu, he has given up Peking opera life since the 17th year of the Republic of China, and it has been eleven years now. His daily life is quite comfortable, and he enjoys teaching his children and grandchildren. In recent years, he has suffered from phlegm, which sometimes heals and sometimes flares up. Unexpectedly, he suffered from a cold a few days ago, which led to his death. Now, I will describe his life events below, so that everyone can see a glimpse of it.</p>
<p>Yu's Origins: Zhenting's grandfather was named Xiaoxia, who was a rare famous actor of Kunqu opera in his time. His son Jiusheng (i.e., Zhenting's father), also known as Runxian, had three sons: the eldest was Zhenting, the second was Zanting, and the third was Huating. Jiusheng's martial arts style formed its own school. Yang Xiaolou and Shang Heyu were both his disciples. There were also two others who were his successors (names are forgotten). Therefore, Zhenting's art was inherited from his father's true teachings. His</p>
<p>First Play: That is, in the hall of Yang Lishan's house in Beiping, he performed his masterpiece "The Leopard." The person who played the monkey was Chi Yueting. At that time, Yu was only eighteen years old, and his name became very popular. Yu once formed the Shuangqing Society in the old capital, and performed in the Civilization Garden every period. The famous plays he performed included Yanyang Tower, Picking Huache, Iron Cage Mountain, and The Leopard. Fan Baoting and Chi Yueting were both important roles in the troupe at that time. Since then, he has been invited to Shanghai, Nanjing, Fengtian, Tianjin and other ports many times, and all have been well received. After returning to Ping, he performed in the North China Theater (i.e., Civilization Garden). Soon after, he stopped performing due to illness, when he was one year short of fifty years old.</p>
<p>Cultivating Talents: He opened the Binqing Society around the 13th year of the Republic of China (or the 14th year). He performed in the Guangde Tower every period. The society cultivated many talents. Such as Xu Biyun, Zhao Qixia, Liu Chunsheng, Zhu Binxian, Liu Binsheng, Yu Bin'an, Geng Binfu, Xiao Guihua, Yu Binting, Wang Binfen, Li Binxian, Mao Qinglai, etc., no less than dozens of people. People outside the troupe, such as Li Wanchun, Wang Wenyuan, Yang Baosen, etc., also benefited a lot from the society. When he ran the Shuangqing Society, the people he promoted included Yu Lianquan (Xiao Cuihua), Mei Lanfang, Gao Zijun (Qingkui), Shang Xiaoyun (Qixia), etc. All benefited from him.</p>
<p>Friends in Need: Yu was bold and made friends. In the Peking opera world, there were many friends in need, such as Wang Yaoqing, Gai Jiaotian, Yu Shuyan, Chi Zijun, Chi Yueting, Li Chunlai, etc. In addition, he often helped people in the same industry financially. Therefore, his lifelong savings have been exhausted because of this.</p>
<p>Passed Away with a Smile: Recently, he suffered a severe illness. On the morning of the 21st of this month, his family knew that he would not recover. The funeral arrangements had already been made. At 12:00 noon, Yu summoned his family to his bedside. Because phlegm had risen, his words were mostly blurred. He probably said that his five sons should work hard to make progress, and he touched the head of his fourth son Shilong. He passed away with a smile at 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Huangbai Coffin: The coffin was bought from Henian Changzhe on Qianmenwai Street. The material was Huangbai, and the price was 800 yuan. The shroud and other things were from Ruifuxiang, and the price was more than 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Many people in the Peking opera world went to pay their respects after hearing the news. Yu's original wife, Cao, is still alive, but she no longer cares about family affairs. It is said that she was the daughter of a famous actor in those years. Yu married many concubines in his life, and three of them have died. His second concubine is the one who is in charge of the family affairs now, and she is very capable. Yu's coffin has been moved to the famous temple Sansheng Temple. The burial site will be chosen.</p>

<h3>Good News in the Singing World Singer Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Singing Tonight at the Lyceum Theatre</p>
<p>In order to communicate European and Asian drama, the Eurasia Song and Dance Drama Company has specially spent a lot of money to hire the world-renowned singers Alexander Valentine and Miguel Spranski. The former is good at high notes, and the beams and dust fall when he sings a song. The latter is famous for his bass, and his resentment and weeping are touching. The two stars have arrived in Shanghai as scheduled and will sing at the Lyceum Theatre on Meyer Road, Bubbling Well Road at 9:00 tonight (31st). Those who love music and songs can book a seat at the theatre or Moude Piano Company.</p>
<h3>The Process of Xiao's Play Being Adapted into a Movie (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jiafeng</p>
<p>That friend lent him a thousand francs, and Pascal ran to Lute to meet the accountant (he was a lawyer in London). After ten negotiations, they still hadn't agreed. What should Pascal do? The lawyer charged a high price, requiring prepayment and requiring all guarantees, while the money in Pascal's pocket was getting less and less every day. Finally, all his money ran out. Walking along the Lute shipyard, he unintentionally saw a British cargo ship leaving for London within an hour.</p>
<p>"Where is the captain?" Pascal asked with a flash of inspiration.</p>
<p>"What are you asking him for?" A sailor in front of him replied. "He's probably in the tavern across the road?"</p>
<p>"Captain," the Hungarian begged the tall, generous man, "Only you can save my life, I will always be grateful to you."</p>
<p>Maska briefly told him his current situation. He received Bernard Shaw's reply, and his consultation with Bernard Shaw's accountant was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>"If you take me to London, I will be able to meet Bernard Shaw. As long as I see him, all the problems can be solved in half an hour."</p>
<p>Thirty hours later, Pascal arrived in London and went to Bernard Shaw's home.</p>
<p>"I'm Gottfried Pascal," he said. "I'm here to ask you to sign this contract yourself, because your accountant, although very good at doing business, I can't get along with him. You think, he dragged our negotiations on for more than ten days, and I can't get a penny out of my pocket. In fact, I'm now asking the captain of a cargo ship to bring me to London to see you."</p>
<p>Bernard Shaw laughed out loud when he heard these words. The two then talked for a while and drank a glass or two of whiskey. Bernard Shaw signed the filming rights of "Pygmalion" to Habasga on the back of the envelope of that letter.</p>
<p>This film is being made in London - a new producer is moving towards success. (Translated from Magazine Digest)</p>

<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Peking Opera in the Old Capital (91)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Singing of Sending a Son on Stage, Crying for Brothers Under the Stage</p>
<p>Later, when I saw Deng Bodao tying his own son to a tree and carrying his nephew away, I couldn't hold back my tears anymore and started crying loudly. Moreover, when I heard the clapper board writing the blood letter, it seemed that every word was cursing me, giving me an excellent lesson and making me feel guilty; so I wanted to go home immediately, find my brother back, not only to apologize to him, but also to open a list of ancestral inheritance and let him choose whatever he wanted, and the rest would belong to me. Only in this way can I be worthy of my dead parents and my own conscience. After saying this, the man left in a hurry. According to his neighbors (neighbors in Beiping are called street neighbors), this kind gentleman really did what he said. From this, we can know how great the power of dramatic influence is; at the same time, how profound Tan Xinpei's acting skills are. So I say that Lao Tan is a great social educator, and perhaps no one will object to this statement.</p>
<p>Lao Yu's Bronze Fan and Iron Crutch Weigh About Thirty Pounds</p>
<p>Many older people in the Peking opera business like to get up early. When they walk out of their homes, they are either carrying birdcages, holding crutches, or holding long-stemmed pipes, and there are gourds in their arms, (gourd is called brother) spinning two purple and bright round walnuts in their palms, and more than a dozen singing without stopping, and the walnuts in their hands are clacking, as if they are playing the board. These colorful predecessors of the Peking opera world all go to Nancheng Gen, Yaotai, Xian Nongtan, and Tianqiao to breathe some fresh air, hang their birdcages on big pine trees, and compete to see whose bird sings the loudest and longest. People who carry gourds also take them out of their arms and put them in the sun, feed them some food, and everyone sits on the very clean sandy ground, talking about the grand events of the Tianbao years; on the other hand, they sigh about their own life experience and the lack of talents in the Peking opera world in recent years. There are also those who are too old and have received the grace of the Empress Dowager Cixi, who always repeat the benefits of the old Buddha. After a short while, more pedestrians come, and their morning lessons are over. This kind of daily exercise is just like morning exercises for young people. It is really an excellent way to keep healthy, so there are really many people who enjoy high age.</p>
