<p>汪兆銘承本黨付託之重、値抗戰緊急之際、擅離職守、匿踪異地、傳播違背國策之主張、二十九日來電、竟謬論以敵相近衛根本滅亡我國之在悖的聲明為根據、而向敵求和、一面騰之報章、廣為散發、以建議中央為名、逞搖惑人心之技、而其電文內容、允處處為敵人要求、曲意文飾、不惜顚倒是非、為敵張目、更復變本加厲、助其欺蒙、就其行為而言、實為通敵求降、充其影響所及、直欲感動國本、我國為救亡圖存、發動抗戰、百餘萬將士之死傷、數百萬同胞之犧牲、慘痛深切、無非欲根本消滅敵人侵略毒計、以永保我國家民族世代永久之生命、年餘以來、國民則精神團結、將士則踴躍用命、萬衆一心、咸集中於本黨總裁委員長領導之下、堅毅不屈、有必達勝利之自信、今敵人謀我之野心益彰、技倆益毒、即吾全國之敵愾愈切、决心愈堅、汪之所言、不但為中央所痛絕、實亦為全國民衆所不容、查戰爭期間、任何國民、絕對不得違反戰時國策之决定而自作主張，本黨紀律、更絕對不許逾越黨的正式决議、違反黨的規則、而以個人發表其意見、在兆銘此種行動、其為違反紀律、危害黨國、實已昭然若揭、大義所在、斷難姑息、即予永遠開除其黨籍、並撒除一切職務、藉肅黨紀、以正吏治、我國民須知抗戰决勝之最要關鍵、唯在意志統一、精神不貳、我民族在昔迭遭外侮、如宋·如明·固僅為一姓一家朝代之潰滅、而非為我民族之覆亡、然其致敗之原則、皆由當時朝廷少數奸邪、天良喪盡以致滅亡、决非民氣與國力之不能抗敵也、故今日抗戰、非整肅綱紀、不足以振作精神、非祛除携貳、不足以戰勝强寇、綜觀敵人最近之毒計、實欲威脅我精神、而導我於分裂覆亡、本黨深知我全國同胞民、民族意識普遍發揚、春秋大義、深入人心、只靠堅定不移奮鬥不屈之精神、嚴守國策、統一意志、最後勝利、自必實現、今後抗戰國策、一以本黨總裁上月二十六日在中央紀念週所發表之演詞為唯一標準、願我全國同志及將士同胞、本此意志、悉力以赴、其有背越斯旨之一切言論與行動、皆為國家利益與法紀所不容、與國人共同擯棄、以保持戰時意旨、而完成我三民主義革命救國之使命、（一日電）</p>
<p>（重慶）官方對於汪電、未下評論、政府方面謂迄未收到此電、故無從得諗該電是吾確出在氏、或其他方面、故擬待查明此節後、始能發表正式意見、消息靈通各界對於在氏欲努力覓取中日戰爭之和平解决、固皆意料及之、但對於在氏在此時作此舉動、實不勝詫異、聞自蘆溝橋發生後、至南京陷落前、並漢口陷落後、在氏輒提出和平談判之建議、惟每决皆為蔣委員長與政界其他領袖抗戰之決心所打銷、華人各界現皆相信今日中國之地位、甚形堅固、自中日戰事發生以還從未有如今日之美滿、彼等提出四種因素如下、（一）華軍已完全改編作長期抗戰之分配、（二）因英美貸款之故、中國金融地位更見穩固、（三）因英美疑及日本所發保護第三國在華利益之保證、中國國際地位乃愈強固、（四）中國現較前更較團結、西南西北各省皆一致結實為蔣委員長之後盾、以拒日軍深入內地、而日軍之深入、使華軍抗戰愈佔優勢、華人各界又謂汪氏如在漢口陷落後卽提出和平談判之主張、則當時局勢至不利於中國、其影響實不堪設想、今日局勢已大見好轉、而汪氏乃倡此謬論、實屬令人不解、彼等相信汪氏此舉不特為政府所反對、舉國人民亦將加以痛斥、惟此電是否確出汪氏、現仍為一疑問、（一日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）日本首相近衛文暦發表對華政策之後，中國國民黨要人在精衛卽繼之發出主和通電、此間各報類多加以評論、極右派小日報載稱、「汪精衛發出議和主張時、美國政府又向日本提出照會、對於片面廢止門戶開放政策之舉、拒不予以接受、兩事巧合如此、未便加以忽略、日本政府逆料美國憚於直接行動、美國天然的同盟國卽無暇旁務、乃以投機手段出之、吾人在在精衛主和通電之後、所亟欲知悉者、厥乃中國面是否相當加以響應、俾日本得以中國一大部份民衆意志為口實、而有以間執美國之口、反之中國方面並無人響應和議、日本是吾認仍為美國政府信守故總統華盛頓「勿引起糾紛」之遺訓、而置美國政府之責言於不顧」、溫和派秩序報載稱「在精衛出走之後、中國北部各省民眾在十餘年前、類皆資助直系者、亦未必加以響應、華南方面雖有某將官擬在廣州組織政府之說、特此一政府卽使宣吿成立、其力亦不足以鞏固日本在華南之勢力、準此而論、日本雖以煽動爭議為口實、硬謂蔣介石上將所領導之政府有瓦解之勢、實行國民政府仍能在抵抗侵略國之意志中保持統一、日本所提出之條件、苟非與中國民族生存權利相融洽、卽無和議之可言、急進社會黨共和報載稱、「在精衛主和通電發表之後、重慶方面雖為之震動、但日本方面所謂蔣介石上將實與在精衛同意進行和議、未見其有何根據」、（三十一日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）路透社今日探悉、倫敦華人各界對於所傳在精衛致蔣委員長之「和平」通電、均感遺憾、恐使外界將因此抱中國政府人員已相分裂之不正確現象也、據彼等切實聲稱、今姑置注氏一派不樂政府之聯共而不談、其他各方面中國人民、竭誠擁護蔣委員長、實佔絕大之多數、蔣委員長之痛斥日本和平提議、且態度已得舉國贊助、此點殊可注意、故今實無與日本議和之可能、日本欲中國加入日「滿」經濟集團之意、亦為華人各界所駁斥、因此舉無異置中國於日本完全統制之下也評論在氏者對於其左右之力量習具疑間、惟衆對於汪氏將加入日本卵翼下的南京或北平兩政府之一之謠言、均嗤之以鼻、並以在氏此次一舉之失敗、或將試向日本取得更溫和之條件、而呈諸蔣委員長、（一日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）昨日侵晨、東京接汪精衛致蔣委員長之主和電文、該文已載見各晨報、惟因日本全國皆從事新年慶祝、故未加以批評、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本官塲對於在精衛致蔣委員長之「和平」通電、現時拒不加以批評、日本報紙雖以顯著之地位登載汪氏之電文、但迄今仍守緘默、殆因認汪氏對於近衛之建議、誤解其數要點、而待官方先作評論而後繼之也（一日路透電）</p>
<h3>抗戰局面大為好轉　今後政治應重於軍事　國府昨舉行中華民國成立紀念典禮　林主席致詞最勉全國同胞刻苦奮鬥</h3>
<p>（重慶）國府於元旦上午八時、舉行中華民國成立紀念典禮、由林主席主席、領導行禮、並卽席致詞、詞畢禮成、（一日電）</p>
<p>林主席之演詞</p>
<p>諸位、今天是中華民國二十八年元旦、也就是二十七年前我們中華民國成立的紀念日、也就是我們中國國民黨總理孫中山先生、在民國元年、就任中華民國第一任大總統的紀念日、因為有總理的倡導革命、才有中華民國的成立、又因為有總理的就任大總統、才有共和政府和民主政治的產生、所以我們在今天舉行這個紀念典禮、除了通常的慶祝這一年的元旦日以外、還要很虔誠的向我們總理歡致革命的敬禮、更要很切實的檢查我們過去的工作成績、和决定我們將來的努力方針、一方面改正我們已往的缺點、一方面增進我們此後的效能、繼續我們總理的革命遺志、完成我們總理的未竟事業、才不致於辜負我們國父手創中華民國一番艱難奮鬥的苦心、才不致於辜負我們今天這個光榮偉大的紀念、談到過去一年的工作、在軍事方面、自從全面抗戰發動以來、由於我們軍事統帥蔣委員長的指揮有方、和全體將士的忠勇效命、以及全國民衆的共同奮鬥、在第一期抗戰期間、已經將敵人的「不戰而屈服中國」、和「速戰速决」的戰略、打成了粉碎、在這一年零六個月的作戰期間、我們雖然是失去了許多的土地和城市、但由戰略上說、不但使敵人的計劃成了一個泡影、完全不能實現、並且我們是充分的收到了「持久戰」和「消耗戰」的有利效果、這不能不算是我們在軍事上的偉大成功、現在的軍事已經轉入第二期抗戰的新階段了、我們的戰略也有新的决定、今後的戰事重心、將為力爭主動和着重攻擊敵人的後方、使敵人處於被動的地位、疲於奔命、愈陷愈深、再無深入的可能、而我們軍隊的主力、不但仍然健在、而且逐漸的加强、以後的作戰地大半都在山岳地帶、敵人愈深入將愈威困難、形勢於我將更為有利、我們必定能够達到「持久」戰、「全面戰」、和「爭取主動」的目的、整個的抗戰局勢、必定大為好轉、我們可以深信敵人絕對不能征服中國、我們必定能够始終堅持抗戰到底、爭取最後的勝利、</p>
<p>實施抗戰建國綱領</p>
<p>至於政治方面為了適應抗戰的需要起見、在過去一年的中間、也有相當的改進、例如政治機構的調整、民意機關的設立、外交運用的成就、財政基礎的鞏固、經濟建設的積極、和敎育文化事業的維護與推進等等、都是頗有顯著的成績以外、其他的各項行政、和立法·司法·考試·監察·各部份的事務、由於各主管長官的認眞督率、和其所屬人員的盡職、也大都能够完成他們在戰時的特殊任務、在民衆方面、更能够同心協力、精誠團結、無論在戰區游擊區、以及其他各方面的、都是忍受一切痛苦、堅定抗戰的决心、必勝的信念、擁護政府、服從領袖、貢獻人力物力、不避犧牲、一致奮鬥、盡到每個人應盡的責任、這是値得我們吿慰於全國國民的、但是在這第二期抗戰的時侯、應該是政治重於軍事、後方重於前方、人民重於軍隊、我們不但對於過去這點些小的成績、不能作有自滿的意識、尤其要知道來日大難、我們的困苦、將要一天加深一天、也就是我們的責任、將要一天加重一天、我們要百尺竿頭更進一步·繼續不斷的加培奮鬥·從今年元旦起、就要决定我們今後的努力方針、以實施抗戰建國綱領、為唯一的目的、我們要深切認識、惟有這個抗戰建國綱領、才是我們的旣定國策、也才是我們今後努力的指導原則、和明確方針、惟有實施抗戰建國綱領、使這個綱領中的各種條理和需要、都能够一件一件的完全做到、才是完成國民革命、實施三民主義的切實工作和光明大道、</p>
<p>大家負起非常責任</p>
<p>我們尤其要知道、抗戰的目的是在維護國際的和平、促進世界的大同、並且於我國特殊歷史的演進、和時局的逼迫、已使這抗戰建國兩伴事情、具有一種不可分離的關係、非抗戰不能建國、非建國不能抗戰、兩者之間是要相輔相成、同時並進、一面抗戰、一面建國、才能希望達到我們的目的、這種在抗戰中建國、在建國時抗戰的工作、其艱苦困難的程度、自然非尋常可比、　我們在這非常的時代、担負起這種非常的責任、倘若沒有非常時的努力、是不能完成我們的非常的任務的、古人說得好、「一年之計在於春、一日之計在於晨、」希望我們全體同志、全國同胞、都要從今天起、立下從新做起的決心、抱定自強不息的精神、刻苦奮鬥、加培努力、完成我們抗戰建國的偉大使命、才不負今天的這個光榮經念、最後我們要敬祝中華民國萬歲、和諸位的健康、（一日電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>抗戰第二期的勝利形勢</h3>
<p>從整個抗戰形勢的質的轉變上說，在華軍放棄武漢以後，是已由退守防禦的第一期而進入了游擊反攻的第二期。在這第二期開始的抗戰中，中國佔有了第一期中所造成的消耗敵方，强固自己的優勢，而使得勝利的前途，益發顯現。</p>
<p>在軍事上，日方五十餘萬軍士的傷亡和無量數火器的耗費，已使他們喪失了一等强國的虛威。同時華軍從各點綫上取得相當代價後而逐步退守，到現在己經誘敵深入山林區域。那不但延長了戰綫，分散和削弱了敵方的軍力；並且又把陣地轉入平面，使得敵軍的水陸兩路不能呼應，重兵器失其威力，而更便於華軍改陣地戰爲流動戰和游擊戰，改被動的防守戰爲進襲戰。最近來在日軍前後方各區域中，中國游擊隊的普遍建立，加强和擴大，而紛起反攻襲擊，將使日軍更陷於疲憊。在以後的戰鬥中，日方的火器和軍士的消耗，與華軍的對比是在遞增起來，這是他們失敗的致命傷，也是中國取勝的關鍵。</p>
<p>在政治上，從抗戰開始到現在，中華全國上下同抱持久抗戰的决心，這把日方「以華制華」「速戰速决」等陰謀，打得粉碎。最近雖有在精衛突發其個人怪誕的主張，然自政府而至人民，齊起申討，却足反證他們抗戰意志的萬分堅决，無法搖撼。同時，中國政治機構的漸决革新，軍隊中的政治工作日益增强，民衆政治認識的提高和蜂起參加戰役，是加高發揮了抗戰的全面性。而日方呢，雖也在佔領區內收買傀儡和僞軍，可是這些爲羣衆所共棄的醜類，不能發生多大作用；並且有許多並不心服，而常有叛變反正的危機。再則，那拖久了的侵略戰爭，所給予日方士兵和民衆的損害，痛苦，一天顯著一天，因而那厭戰，反戰的暗潮，是在潛流高漲；國內人民陣綫的反戰活動，僞軍和朝鮮台灣人民的反叛和變亂，都是已見的事實，而且今後定將蔓延擴大。這不但是動搖着日方的軍心和民心，而且也是逗起日本國內革命的星火。</p>
<p>在經濟上，日方的財力在這决戰爭中的消耗，比中國要多上三四倍，以致各準備有匱乏之勢。而他們在中國所奪佔到的點綫，又在華方游擊隊的困擾下，不但無法利用來開發資源，倒須多費錢財去供養駐軍。他們爲謀挽救財政的崩潰，因而破壞九國公的，在佔領區內攫奪海關，和排斥第三國的商業利益；但因此引起了英美各國的抵貨運動。却反增加了他們的困窘。至於中國呢，金融既始終穩定，而內地的寳藏又在進行開發：可以說，抗戰是促進了中國經濟的進步。最近英美借欽的成功，更增加了中國很大的經濟力量。</p>
<p>在外交上，各民治國家的人民，果然一向同情和聲援着中國的抗戰，而最近英美政府援華的積極和借欵的成立，更是對於日本的一大威脅，他的影響，果使中國抗戰力量更强，使日本侵略：更感棘手；並且還使蘇聯敢對日本出以更加强硬的態度，來牽制日軍，最近漁業爭案談判，便是一個明證。所以，在抗戰第二期開始中，在國際上的反日反侵略的統一戰綫，是已開了端緒。這是中國攻勢外交的勝利，他所給予敵人的打擊，無論在物質上，在精神上，都是很大的。</p>
<p>在這抗戰第二期中，我們看見那三個足以戰勝並且消滅日本帝國主義者的條件，是正在成熟起來了：中國的抗日統一戰綫是已經完成了，並且加强着，國際上的抗日統一戰綫是正在胎育着，而日本人民的革命也是在暗中醞釀，加以交戰陣地的轉移和華軍戰略的改變所佔軍事上的優勢，是爲第三期大規模收復失土的殲滅戰，展開了勝利的前奏！</p>
<p>不過，中國要眞眞地爭取最後的勝利，還需要國民在主觀上加倍努力，更進一步地强固全國團結，堅持搞戰到底，和大家出錢出力，以粉碎日方所可能發出的挑撥離間，鼓吹和平的空氣，以及在淪陷區內所施行的欺詐麻醉的政策，那才行。吾則，鬆懈了一分力量，那就會把已經造成的有利條件錯過了！</p>
<h3>美政府公布對日強硬照會　不承認違約創造新局面　任何建議祇可由關係各國會議討論　英當局與美意見一致亦已通告日方</h3>

<p>薩拉曼加　西班牙國民軍司令部宣稱、巴塞羅納之報吿、謂共和軍在勒利達迤南反攻頗爲順利、並不與事實相符、實際上在卡塔蘭戰綫之共和軍祇有後退、何嘗反攻、國民軍進展奇速、在克刺拿帶拉方面之共和軍措手不及、祇有乞降而已（一日海通電）</p>

<h3>英德海軍現狀　德國建造小型潛艇　威力超過英國一倍</h3>
<p>（倫敦）星期泰晤士報海軍訪員著文論英德之海軍談話云、此項談判、有一種情形頗堪注意、卽德國建造小型潛艇、則其潛艇力量、或將超過英國一倍以上、德國目下潛水艇之數、已多於英、計爲七十二艘、與六十九艘之比、不過噸位則僅及英國潛艇百分之四十五、因德國潛艇純供沿海之用、皆屬小型、英國潛艇因須開往世界任何地方、故以較大者爲適宜云、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）英德海軍談話昨已完畢、據稱、德國將建造大戰時同樣驚人之潛艇、據觀察家稱、德國大的將建造新潛艇一百三十艘、大戰時德國所有潛艇共一百四十艘、（一日美聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據路透外交訪員消息、關於德國要求建造與英國同量潛艇事、英德代表在柏林會商後之情形、此間雖尙無官方消息可得、惟似無任何理由、可以揣測德國將變更意向、英國赴德代表團領袖克寗漢海軍中將、已於昨日乘飛機返抵倫敦、對於柏林會商經過、將繕具報吿、提交英外部、聞此决報吿將分致現在紐克夏休假之首相張伯倫及外相哈里法克斯二人、聞英政府曾於開會商議時、質詢德國欲多造潛艇之理由云、（一日路透電）</p>

<p>（柏林）德國政府自本月十九日向英國提出照會、主張依據一九三五年六月十八日英德兩國海軍恊定、而將德國潛水艇噸位予以提高、俾與英國潛水艇劃位相等之後、英國政府卽已派遣海軍代表團由海軍中將克銀漢領導、前來此間、進行磋商、半官機關德意志通信社頃發出消息稱、「英國海軍部代表團、本月二十九日到達此間之後、昨日曾與德國海軍代表、在極友好精神之下、進行談話、雙方曾就一九三五年英德海軍協定（關於量的限制者）與一九三七年七月十三日英德海軍協定（關於質的限制者）所引起各項問題、分別說明見解、德國政府卽當依據此項談話結果、向英國政府提出書面照會、英國海軍部代表團業於本日遄返倫敦」云、據消息靈通人士所知、德國代表除表示欲將潛水艇噸位提高至與英國潛水艇噸位相等而外、日將甲級巡洋艦備砲口徑問題提付討論、至以德國現有之潛水艇隊實力而論、按之海軍年鑑所載、自一九三五年起至一九三七年止、各級潛水艇之已下水者、計有五〇〇〇噸者十艘、七一二噸者二艘、二五〇噸者二十四艘、現在建造中者、計有二五〇噸者六艘、五四七噸者十一艘、七四〇噸八艘、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>最近日軍以華軍業抽調雄厚兵力、擇要據守、自知不易得逞、乃又改取守勢、故連日在馬口·河口·思貢·滘口·大路墟·等處、趕築防禦工事、並在馬房附近之木棉崗·貓兒崗·各處、架有小鋼砲數門、以防華軍反攻、數日來、不時以小鋼砲向東猛轟、企圖阻止華軍渡河、十六日、在馬口自晨至暮、隔河向華軍方面砲轟、十八日至二十一日、更竟日砲轟金利華軍陣地、該兩處華軍、均沈着應戰、迭决發砲回擊、同時日機亦連日溯江西上、大施轟炸、査高要縣屬之永安·廣利·金利·貝水·祿步·新橋·守隆·白土·四會縣城外新隆村一帶、及倉岡·白沙·大沙·上羅·四堡·鄉沙尾、高明之中下兩區、以及廣寗與各方之交通綫、均被慘炸、日軍是舉、固係騷擾華軍後方、但亦企圖破壞華方軍運、惟華方整個反攻廣州計劃、早經軍事當局决定、除由西江東下而外、主力則由北江沿粤漢錢挺進、是以西江北岸之日軍、仍不無顧忌、恐將爲華軍四面夾擊、故進犯蘆苞之日軍、二十四日已有向木棉崗逃竄模樣、日軍旣進退失據、北岸戰事、亦因而稍趨沈寂、日軍在南岸爲求達到攻取三洲·金利·進犯高要之目的，一方面首先圖襲擊九江附近之游擊隊、謀穩定九江、別方面則出犯鶴山縣之谷埠沙坪、藉以掩護前進、故近日九江沙口之東南方及甘竹灘方面之華方游擊隊、不時與日軍發生激戰、二十一二十二兩日、九江日軍、發砲六十餘、向谷埠猛烈轟擊、掩護日軍橡皮艇載兵登陸、卒以當地自衛團·游擊隊·奮起迎擊、毁橡皮艇兩艘、斃日兵數十、日軍乃狼狽而退、因此、目前鶴山海口、又呈緊張之象、</p>
<p>進犯西江之日軍、兵力原甚單薄、在此期間、日軍遂大量抽調東江之部隊、開返廣州、轉道增援九江、而東江華軍、卽得乘虛收復惠州、博羅、二十三日、華軍續向前錢增援、其先頭部隊、已抵增·博·兩縣交界之九仔潭附近、俟與增屬部隊取得聯絡、卽行加入反攻、而增援東莞方面之大軍、亦已决第越過河源·惠州·博羅·而到東莞縣境、刻分兩路挺進中、一循惠州之淡水、二十三日下午三時、已達龍崗、二十四日、開抵平湖、此路任務、爲聯絡寳安縣守備軍之張瑞貴部及握守廣九路沿錢之譚邃部、會攻東莞縣城、一由東江溯流而下、逕攻石龍、伺機進行向太平虎門將殘餘日軍掃蕩、觀此、則廣九路全綫、日內亦不免發生大戰、</p>
<p>南路方面、自日前北海·圍洲島·海南島·一帶日艦雲集百餘艘、來往逡巡、意圖沿海騷擾、於是南路各屬形勢、緊張異常、迨至二十四日、北海方面大沙·白龍尾·石龜頭·冠頭嶺等處、已艦確已盡行他駛、情勢復呈弛緩、但軍事當局、爲應付非常事變、已分別加派軍隊嚴防、現陽江·電白·兩屬、由×旅及×團與×游擊司令部陳修爵等率領部隊駐守、而第××游擊司令、亦率領高州各屬團隊與新編×師及××團、分頭扼守高州沿海之錢、北海方面、除駐有挂軍莫樹杰·黃固·等師部隊外、現桂省仍源源開到步隊若干師駐紮、目前南路佈置、已稱就緒、抗戰力量、亦甚雄厚、</p>
<h3>華軍克復宜興　一度衝至日軍大本營之漕橋</h3>
<p>宜興通信、據確實報吿、駐紥宜興張渚山中之華軍，於十二月下旬開始向宜興駐城日軍總攻、城中日軍二百餘名、雖挾有小鋼砲及輕重機關槍等利器、倉惶應戰、無如華軍人多勢壯、猛力攻城、經一畫夜之激戰、日軍死傷過半、餘衆向四鄉狼狽潰敗、華軍當於二十四日將宜城克復、一部份日軍數十名由公路竄逃至日軍大本營駐守地之漕橋鎭、華軍乘勝推進、追踪向漕橋進攻、據傳並曾將漕橋佔領、但未能證實、現華軍在距宜城十餘里之和橋、與日軍激戰中、査和橋爲宜邑之重鎮、商業繁盛、爲水陸交通之孔道、又悉、當華軍進駐宜城後、卽搜索偽「縣長」臧荔臣等、但臧等已於事前逃走、當將僞「縣府」搗毁、並將宜城「維持會會長」徐開山緝獲、本擬執行槍决、經宜城父老之請求、免其一死、現在監禁中、</p>

<h3>眼鏡考</h3>
<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>一　眼之爲用大矣哉</p>
<p>世稱人之智慧者爲聰明；聰者，耳聞之審也；明者，目見之切也。蓋智識經騐之成就，之能深造，無一不從見聞中得來，故以聰明稱人之智慧，亦即見耳目器官之重要也。自來一切事物之形態優劣，莫不以目接之，而後思辨，之作用以起。無所見即失所明，失所明，即不知何者爲優，何者爲劣。優劣之不分，即是非之不明；是非之不明，即公道之不仲；大而至於社會國家，小而至於公司家庭，苟其所見之不明，未有不小人道長，君子道消，釀成亂亡失敗之階也。惟其明，乃能辨賢奸，知好惡，明是非，張公道，察順逆，嚴從違，雖有敵國外患，不足以奪其氣，貧苦艱難，不足以搖其志；則國未有不洽，民未有不興者也。此皋陶所謂「天聰明，自吾民聰明，」正爲結集民衆之智慧，而爲社會國家之智慧也。</p>
<p>不但此也，人之善惡，智愚，未嘗不可於其雙目中見之。吾人不言相，可以孟子之言證之：</p>
<p>「存乎人者，莫良於眸子；眸子不能掩其惡。胸中正，則眸子瞭焉；胸中不正，則眸子眊焉。聽其言也，觀其眸子，人焉厦哉！」</p>
<p>聽其言也之爲聰，觀其眸子之爲明。人不能明察是非，不識好歹，是無目者也。若「明足以察秋毫之末，而不見輿薪，」或管窺而蠡測，又豈得謂之有目者乎！</p>
<p>人以生理上之關係，不能保其目力之平準；正視者可一變而爲遠視，昧於近物；短視者則又不能辨物於咫尺之外，欲彌此缺陷，則眼鏡尙矣。眼鏡所以使目之不明者明之，目力所不能及者及之。自有眼鏡，近者能遠，遠者能近，而無不便矣。且文化愈發達，用目之機會愈多，目力之消耗焉亦愈甚，而需用眼鏡者亦愈衆，此固必然之趨勢也。</p>
<p>惟戴眼鏡者，原以求其明，但戴有色眼鏡者宜須愼。有色眼鏡，所以殺光綫之刺戟，若誤以爲鏡之色，即爲物之色；己所見亦如人所見，則將如墨子所謂「染於蒼則蒼，染於黃則黃，一無往而非失其眞矣。</p>
<p>獻歲伊始，例有祝頌之詞，興趣之作，但在經濟專刊之文字中，實難其選。夫欲不脫經濟性質，並可以見中西貿易之發　者，因思前人之說康健者，常曰耳目聰明，手足淸健。又謂人之建大業者，必曰，目光遠大，識見高超。用是作眼鏡考，以祝諸君目益明，眼光愈遠大，母拘拘於目前之事實，母斤斤於一己之利益，立定脚跟，放大眼光，明年此日，當與諸君共祝勝利之新年。並以見眼鏡雖小，而爲中西互市之始，是爲考。</p>
<p>二　眼鏡究從何處來</p>
<p>眼鏡爲中國所自有，抑爲外國所輸入，此在稍作常識之研究，即知其爲科學之產物，必非中國所自有。然則自何處來，何時始入中國，則以載籍缺略，難得有準確之考證。各書所載眼鏡之始源，多根據明張靖之所著方州雜錄，謂來目番舶滿刺加，其父方伯公嘗得宣廟所賜予，官廟稱明宣宗也，則宣德年間，已有眼鏡矣。但滿刺加爲何等國家而有此眼鏡，此則須先明當時海外交通之情形。</p>
<p>按成祖自奪帝位，惠文帝出走，不知所終，成祖疑其尙在人間，遍索國內不得，乃欲求之域外。（一）永樂三年六月命三保太監鄭和率王景弘等，通使西洋，自蘇州劉家河泛海，（即今瀏河）由瀏河至寗波，轉福建，由福建而出南洋，此行也，以五年九月返國。（二）六年九月再往錫蘭山諸國，九年六月返國。（三）十年十一月復命和至蘇門答刺等處，以十三年七月還朝。（四）十四年滿刺加古里等十九國，咸遣使朝貢，後命和等偕往賜其君長，十七年七月還。（五）十九年春復往，明年八月還。（六）二十二年正月舊港酋長施濟孫請襲宣　使職，好齎敕印往賜之，比還，而成祖已晏駕。（七）宣德五年六月帝以踐祚歲久，而諸番國遠者猶未朝貢，於是鄭和王景弘復奉命歷忽魯謨斯等十七國而返。和出國凡七决，自南洋羣島遠歷至今印度（榜葛萊錫蘭）等凡三十餘國，所取無名寳物不可勝計，無名者，必其中多有爲中國人所不經見，故不能道其名耳。如眼鏡亦即包括於此「無名寳物」之中，則宣德　宜有此物；反之，若必以爲出於滿刺加，則滿刺加在明初尙服屬於暹邏，僅爲草昧初闢之部落耳。永樂元年，明中官尹慶使其地，以金帛誘其酋長人朝，三年九月，酋即隨慶入京，成祖封之爲滿刺加國王，滿刺加之稱王，自此始。六年鄭和使其國，自是朝貢常通，直至成化十七年而止，計有二十三次。</p>
<p>雖入貢甚頻，但觀其物產中，並不見有玻璃一類之產物，即按其民智亦島能有眼鏡一類之製品。故以產品言，可與其隔衣帶水之蘇門答刺出產相比絞，以見滿刺加之產品中，容有工藝品，亦疑其非自產，藍史稱蘇門答刺氣候風俗人情正相同，則其所產宜無不同也。</p>
<p>（一）滿刺加出品</p>
<p>瑪瑙　珍珠　珊瑚樹　鶴頂　金母鶴頂　犀角　象牙　黑熊　黑猿　白麂　火雞　鵡鸚　瑣服　白苾布　西　布　撒哈刺　片腦　薔薇露　蘇合油　梔千花　烏爹泥　沉香　速香　金銀香　阿魏　斗錫</p>
<p>（二）蘇門答刺出品</p>
<p>瑪瑙　寳石　水晶　石靑　回回靑　善馬　犀牛　沉香　速香　丁香　龍涎香　降　眞香　刀麵　錫　瑣服　胡椒　蘇木　硫黃</p>
<p>然則滿刺加產物中何以有蘇門答刺所無之產物，此則可證滿刺加之物產中，有爲歐洲之產物，即明人謂眼鏡自番舶滿刺加來者，亦是此種原因耳。</p>
<p>在明正德年間（西曆一五一一年即正德六年）佛郞機强舉兵侵奪其地，王蘇端媽末出奔，遣使吿難，時世宗嗣位，敕責佛郞機令還其故土，論還羅諸國王以救災卹鄰之義，迄無應者，滿刺加竟爲所滅。先是以交通不便，佛郞機已滅滿刺加，明猶未知之，故正德十三年戊寅（西曆一五一六年）遣使加必丹末等貢方物，請封，始知其名，（按葡人刺斐原比斯特多由瑪拉加至廣東，爲西曆一五一六年即正德十一年丙子）詔給方物之直遣還。其人久留不去，剽刦行旅，至掠小兒爲食。已而夤緣鎭守中貴許入京武宗南巡，（正德十四年八月）其使火者亞三因江彬侍帝左右，帝時學其語以爲戲。正於十五年始許入貢。十六年武宗崩，是年七月携土物求市，遂拒絕之。其將別都盧旣以巨礮利兵肆掠滿刺加諸國，橫行海上，復率其屬疎世利駕五舟擊巴喇西國。嘉靖二年（西曆一五二三年）遂寇新會之西草灣，明指揮柯榮等拒之，生擒別都盧疎世利等，得其礮，即名爲法郞機，並絕其通市。但當時粤吏公私計費皆取諸番舶，番舶不至無所得，爲請於朝仍許其互市，於是法郞機得入香山澳爲市。至嘉靖十四年佛郎機在香山澳壕鏡築室建城，雄踞海畔，若一國然；高棟飛甍，櫛比相望，閩粤商人趨之若鶩。久之，其來益衆，諸國人畏而避之，遂專爲所據。嘉靖四十四年猶託言滿刺加人貢，朝臣知其爲法郞機偽託也，拒之，但其後大西洋人（意大利）等來中國，亦居於此。</p>
<p>滿刺加俗本淳厚，市道頗平，自爲佛郞機所破，其風頓殊，商舶稀至，多直詣蘇門答刺，然必取道其國，率被邀刦，海路幾斷，其自販於中國者，則直達廣東香山澳，接跡不絕。</p>
<p>由此一段史實，滿刺加在正德年間已爲佛郞機所占有，而至嘉靖四十四年法郞機之在中國往來，猶託言爲滿刺加，蓋中國人但知爲滿刺加，法郞機即以滿刺加自居。不知所謂佛郞機者，遠在歐陸西隅，滿刺加者，近在暹羅之南端，史家尙謂佛郞機與滿刺加相近，其他又安能辨其地程之遠近。佛滿不分，此眼鏡由滿刺加來誤之所生也。</p>
<p>且明人眼鏡亦有自西域來，吳寬匏翁集有謝人送西域眼鏡詩去：</p>
<p>世傳離婁明　雙眼不能沒　千年黃壞間　化生直百鎰</p>
<p>吳寬爲明成化八年狀元；長洲人（至今人猶樂道之吳中四才子，「唐祝文徐」，皆爲吳之後進。）歷仕成化弘治正德三朝，卒於官，以行履高潔，詩文有典則稱於時。而於人贈以西域眼鏡，稱揚如此，比之爲離婁之明（離婁，古之明目者），千年化生，價直百鎰，（每鎰爲二十四兩，此言百鎰，極言其珍貴耳，）抑何其珍視乃爾。故七修總稿之記述眼鏡，在今日視之，竟類於神話矣。其言曰：</p>
<p>「聞貴人有眼鏡，老年觀書，小字畢見，誠世寳也。此以活大車渠之珠囊製之，常須養之懷中，勿令乾死，然後可照字。」</p>
<p>何以有此怪誕不經之談，又何以價値如是之貴，按通俗編有云：明之中葉，眼鏡自西域傳行中國，賈胡誇誕其言，故當時人受其愚罔若此。案歐亞之陸路交通，自漢已開其端，至元深入中歐，往來更繁，及明凡西城各國雖遠至天方，亦多從陸道入嘉峪關。至宜德五年，鄭和使西洋，遣使至古里，古里有船至天方，因使人附其舟以往，天方亦遣使隨之入貢，宜宗大悅。其後天方諸國自海程來者，往往附爪哇滿刺加之舟以行，自陸道來者，仍從西城入嘉峪關。</p>
<p>由此觀之，眼鏡流入中國，早則在宜德年間，遲則爲弘治正德年間。其輸入之路徑，一謂來自番舶滿刺加，一謂來自西域，要之皆自西洋輾轉流入也。</p>
<p>三　眼鏡之得名及形態</p>
<p>眼鏡之始稱爲僾逮，亦作　　。　　本爲雲貌，與眼鏡不相涉，疑詞人以璦逮二字欠雅馴，故改用之耳。但眼鏡何以名爲懓逮，此在前人未之解。有以爲即仿佛之意。用仿佛之意稱眼鏡，亦難索解。余以是疑爲譯音兼取與眼睛相仿佛之意，名之爲僾逮。如爲譯音，當係從葡萄牙語滿刺加語或阿拉伯語中迻譯而來，此三者余均未之諳。惟明史所記各方貢物中，已不少採用譯音，如撤哈刺，哆囉嗹，烏爹尼，白苾布，即其一證。然在英語中（雖其時英語尙未流行東土）之稱眼鏡，如Spectacle如Eye-glass均無僾逮之香可尋。惟Eyed庶幾近之，但爲形容詞，其義亦不甚洽。後人亦以爲係當時閩粤人之土語，輾轉作此書也。總之，僾逮二字，用於眼鏡，不能顯其物之用途，殊不妥貼，故正德閒吳寬詩中，已見用眼鏡字樣矣。蓋鏡之爲義，有照視之意，用之於目，故名之曰眼鏡，則功用形態畢顯，較之僾逮之曖昧不明，遠勝多矣，遂沿用迄今。</p>
<p>明人寫眼鏡之形狀，據張靖之方洲雜錄中云：</p>
<p>「如錢大者二，形色絕似雲母石，而質甚薄，以金相輪廓而紐之，合則爲一，歧開則爲二，老人目昏，張此物於雙目上則大明，來自番舶滿刺加國，名曰靉靆，皆玻璃所製，後粤東人仿其式，以水晶石製之」。</p>
<p>故鷗北詩鈔中，初用眼鏡詩云：</p>
<p>相傳宣德間　來自番船駕</p>
<p>初本嵌玻璃　薄若紙新砑</p>
<p>中土遞仿造　水晶亦流亞</p>
<p>眼鏡之自玻璃改爲水晶，正爲中國無玻璃出品之故。至描寫眼鏡，尙有流傳的七字吟眼鏡（寳塔體）詩，亦堪發噱。</p>
<p>前人咏眼鏡，尙有數聯，其立意大約相同，如云：</p>
<p>長繩雙耳繫　橫橋一鼻跨</p>
<p>另云：</p>
<p>從道幾首的詩中，可見前代的眼鏡，大都以繩作鏡脚，帶於兩耳之上了。</p>
<p>四　老花眼鏡與近視鏡</p>
<p>自萬曆九年（西曆一五八一年）意大利亞人利瑪寳抵廣州之香山澳，二十九年入京師，分遣王豐陽肅瑪諾等於南京，同來者尙有意人龍華民·畢方濟·艾如略·熊三拔，日耳曼人鄧玉函，西班牙人龐迪我，葡萄牙人陽瑪諾，均以傳布大主敎爲事。士大夫如徐光啟李之藻輩均好其說，於是西洋之文化出品，隨傳敎之士，流入內地，眼鏡亦當其一也。</p>
<p>惟當時之眼鏡，尙屬稀少，至淸初猶如此，故蔣廷錫在內廷見康熙有眼鏡，爲其母乞得一副。又如紅樓夢一書，係寫康雍間事，以賈氏如此人家，惟賈母一人有眼鏡，全書中亦止三見。如五十三卷云：</p>
<p>「又有一個鏡匣子，，賈母歪在　上，與衆人說笑一回，又取眼鏡向戲臺上照一回。又說：恕我老了，骨　疼，容我放肆些，歪着相陪罷！」</p>
<p>又第六十九卷云：</p>
<p>「二姐兒（尤二姐）垂頭站在旁邊，賈母上下瞧了一遍，因又笑問你姓什麼，今年十幾歲了，鳳姐忙又笑道，老祖宗且別問，只說比我俊不俊。賈母又帶上了眼鏡，命鴛鴦琥珀把那孩子拉過來我瞧瞧肉皮兒。衆人都抿着嘴兒笑着，推他上去。賈母細瞧了一通，叉命琥珀拿出他的手來我瞧瞧，賈母瞧舉，摘下眼鏡來，笑說道，竟是個齊全孩子，我看比你（稱鳳姐）還俊些。」</p>
<p>第三次用眼鏡見第九十五卷有云：</p>
<p>「賈母打開看時，只見那玉比先前昏暗了好些，一面用手擦摸，鴛鴦拿上眼鏡兒來戴着一瞧，說：奇怪，道塊玉倒是的，怎麼把頭裏的顏色都沒了呢！」</p>
<p>要知道赦政王夫人等都是五十內外之年，該帶眼鏡，雖說父母在，不言老，尊長前，不帶眼鏡，但是燕居之時亦並不說及有帶眼鏡。叉如劉老老以七十餘歲年齡，未聞有眼鏡，正以當時之眼鏡尙少，祇達官貴人家有之，民間尙不多覯</p>
<p>且眼鏡之不易多得，尙有事實作證明，如（一）中國書本，雖爲木刻之故，字跡不能十分纖細，亦爲便老年人之閱讀，故字體常大。（二）家有眼鏡，甚爲珍貴，往往由父母傳之子孫，鏡脚已斷，縛以布繩，繫於兩耳，如得之甚易，何致有此情景耶。故在當時，老年人尙少戴眼鏡，若有眼鏡可帶而不用帶者，則爲之稱奇矣。</p>
<p>相傳翁方綱（覃溪）學士六七十歲時，尙能於燈下作細書，不假靉靆。每歲元旦於西瓜子仁書四楷字；五十後寫「萬壽無疆」，六十後寫「天子萬年」，七十後猶能寫「天下太平」，雖筆書逐漸减少，然於耄　之年，能在西瓜子仁上作此叫字，宜爲任何人所不能及。（使翁覃溪生在今日，昨日元旦，必寫中華萬歲）。叉聞翁早年能在一粒胡麻仁上，寫「一片冰心在玉壺」七字，目力之勝，固稱異稟，其技亦神矣</p>
<p>以上所云，多見其爲老化眼鏡，近視眼鏡則未之有見。以近視眼無眼鏡，故患近視者之視物，常須緊凑其兩眼，接近其事物，時呼之爲瞇啾眼，前人有嘲近視眼詩云：</p>
<p>笑君兩眼忒希奇　子立身邊問是誰</p>
<p>滿屋日光拿蛋子　月移花影拾柴枝</p>
<p>因看壁畫磨穿鼻　爲鎖書橱夾住眉</p>
<p>更是一般堪笑處　吹燈燒了嘴唇皮</p>
<p>以見患近視者如有眼鏡，必不吃此虧矣。余憶近視眼鏡之盛行，尙在光宣之間，其時之息近視眼者始多用眼鏡。在淸乾隆年間，猶無近視眼鏡，於何證之，證之於乾隆。</p>
<p>相傳乾隆亦患短視，南巡至蘇，抵滸墅關，未及覩見其旁之三點水，遽呼爲許　關，人以出於帝皇，遂相沿稱。（其後梁章鉅曾爲乾隆作辯護，以爲可讀許言，但字典上皆讀「虎」音也。）故當時若有近視眼鏡，乾隆决不會看不見水帝也。</p>
<p>乾隆之短視，尚有一證明。蓋近視之所以爲近視，則爲眼球突出，視綫落於焦點之前，故年愈高，以眼球之自然收縮而漸平，視綫與焦點相接近，反可不御眼鏡而視物。故乾隆晚年不用眼鏡，正爲近視之一證。相傳阮文達公元（芸臺）入史館後，適和珅掌院事，元執弟子禮甚恭。未幾大試翰詹，高宗以眼鏡命題，和知乾隆高年不用眼鏡，先洩信於元，故元詩中有云。</p>
<p>四目何須此　重瞳不用他</p>
<p>高宗以押「他一字晚空議論，又暗合己意，置高等開坊。會紀文達公昀（曉嵐）入見，乾隆亦命之作眼鏡詩，以他字限韻，紀立吟一聯云：</p>
<p>聖明安用此　臣昧必須他</p>
<p>都是以乾隆高年不帶眼鏡入詩，可見其患近視也明甚。</p>
<p>至於臣工患近視眼者亦多，雍正時某公短視甚，一日入朝，雍正詢之曰，汝看得見朕吾？對曰，「天威不違顏咫尺」，應對可謂敏捷矣</p>
<p>金匱孫文淸公爾準（平叔）素短親。某年道錢塘江，正遇秋汛，大喜，欲觀潮，放舟江心以俟，比潮至，聞萬馬奔騰聲，急出至鷁首之，舟人諫不聽，立未定，巳爲潮頭捲入江，倉卒之間，但覺浪壓肩背而過，有千萬斤之重，三四翻騰，遂掀於江岸，一無所苦，孫自言素來短視，受此大驚，卒未識潮爲何狀也。</p>
<p>所作眼鏡考止於此。至近來眼鏡之盛行，式樣之改進，鏡片之種類，以不在考之列，故從略。余之友朋中有見此文者，又必莞爾笑曰，柳　專用其精神於此等處，小題大做，甚無謂也。然爲此言者未嘗不知余之用心，是豈好爲之哉！無可消閒，聊爲諸君新年作談助而已</p>

<h3>語文的新年</h3>
<p>— 鄭融</p>
<p>我們中國的語文，源遠流長，無論語體文言，都擁有深厚廣大的文化背景，的確是我們的文化貴重財產之一。但有四難，常在惱人：一是查難，二是學難，三是讀難，四是寫難。這四大難，多少年來已經有無數的通人志士設法降伏，而還未能十分降伏。</p>
<p>爲了查難，就有所謂檢字考案。檢字考案，不知有多少種，如今最流行的有王雲五先生的四角號碼案。除商務印書館的書一律採用外，別處也已經有人採用。但別的方案也還在同時推行，未能算是惟一的。</p>
<p>二爲了學難，又有所謂基本字考案，我們也見過許多基本字方案，比較流行的前有「千字文」，近有「平民千字課」。「千字課」以外，叉有洪深先生的「一千二百字」。如今也都各自在推行。</p>
<p>三，爲了讀難，又有所謂讀音統一或注音考案。我們也見過無數的方案，有的特創，有的採用現成的。特創之中，種類繁多，有偏旁體，速記體，篆文體，草書體等各種，如今都已消滅。最流行的是三種採用現成的字體的，一種採用現成的古漢字的，名呌注音符號，兩種採用現成的國際字母的，一種呌做國語羅馬字，一種呌做拉丁化中國字。就中採用古漢字的一種，單止用來注普通漢字的讀音，所以呌做注音符號；採用國際字母的兩種，都不止用來注音，並且企圖單行做自足的文字。就是企圖連帶解决讀難以外的三難。如今道三種，也都各別在推行中。</p>
<p>四，爲了寫難，又有所謂文法，修辭，和其他各種規律的探求，以及各種語文敎學方法的試騐。企圖脫出馬建忠先生所謂「以文學有不可授受者在，併其可授受者而不一講焉」的舊習。</p>
<p>以上四路的努力都是希望大家對於語文不致永遠費時費力，而語文本身又不致始終停在「可以意會不可以言傳」的神秘境域，不受科學的照明。工作雖多，實際可以節的精進四個字了之。如今一切有志者之間對於各式方案的意見雖然未能十分一致，對於語文需耍有這節的精進的革新可說沒有異議。只還缺欠聯絡，缺欠呼應。倘能更進一步，使彼此的意見更爲接近，或彼此的工作更相呼應，則語文革新的努力一定更爲有效。或者不出三年，就可造成」個四難全除的語文的新年。而敎育的普及和文化的進展，一定可以比現在容易幾倍。深願大家將這一事擺在心頭，作爲新年的行事之一。</p>
<h3>鳳凰鎭過年</h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>夜幕漸漸地垂下來了以後，半空裏就佈滿了爆竹聲音，每一間茅屋和草舍都透露着輝煌的燭光，凛冽的寒風裏還飄送着年夜飯的氣味；整個的鳳凰鎭似乎就在除夕的歡樂情緒中，消褪了它的衰落與貧瘠。</p>
<p>駐紥在一所古寺裹的我們，望到鎭上的過年景象，不禁又把忘懷了的過年趣味重復尋求起來，一個伙伴打起他的南京官話說：「離前錢還有一百八十里，橫直要到明年才能砍幾個××，我們也在這裏度一個快樂除夕罷！」</p>
<p>他的話剛說完，一個傳令兵突然跑進來報吿：「明天一早就要開拔，團長特准在這裏過年，把明天元旦應吃的猪肉提早一晚發下來了。」</p>
<p>「好呀！過年，過年！」聽到這話的一羣伙伴立刻興奮得同呼起來，快樂得眼光中像會爆出火花來似的，就在天井中架起鐵片爐，開始煮飯燒肉；異樣的寒冷都被火燄與肉香所驅逐，各人的內心也在豐厚物質的享受中陶醉了。</p>
<p>然而，隊伍裏過年畢竟不如老百姓那麼安閒，自在；當我們正預備要吃肉的時候，一個哨兵來報吿鳳凰河邊有人在偷波，接着外面又傳進來一連串的喝問口令聲，一聲緊似一聲，我們於是立刻跑出古寺，分兩路包抄到河岸，圍住了四個偷越警戒綫的奸細。這時，古寺後面父突然起火，東面那個村落中也傳來幾響槍聲，這情形的確是嚴重極了，我們立時分開四路，用急行軍的跑步向四週警戒，搜索。一霎那間，十六個放火的漢奸和四個便衣敵兵都屈服在我們的蔴繩中，像牧童牽牛似的押送到團部去。</p>
<p>在路上，那四個便衣鬼，用幾句不純熟的中國話向我們哀求一陣，又互相『以得立司……亨得拿打……」說一陣，同時，還在袋內撈出了一捲鈔票，意思是買我們放他走。這是一個多可惡的舉動呵！侮辱我們新中國的軍人人格。被我們飛起腿，「卜篤」一聲，從他屁股上打停了他嘴巴裹的談話，使他縮回了那隻拿鈔票的手，一連串俘虜與漢奸的行列，就在沉默的步行中押進團部。</p>
<p>坐在一盞豆油燈下檢閱地圖的團長，聽過我們的報吿，似乎很得意的望一望，就微笑地命令釋放他們，然後才對着我們訓話：「我利用時間，一方面試騐你們新兵的防禦力和急中的智謀，一方面叉考察你們奉公守法的程度。現在我派去二十個人一個也沒有遺漏，用錢行賄也不接受，你們雖然是新兵，但我很滿意……。」團長結束了訓話之後，目光炯炯的似乎把一個期望寄託在我們身上。</p>
<p>我們望到那二十個化裝的弟兄，都換上了原來的軍服，覺得心頭的喜悅有點兒空虛；廢然地踱出團部時，心裏都浮起一個將來擒住眞鬼的憧憬。</p>
<p>歸隊後，叉得到團長特賞二十斤肉，—打毛巾。在狼呑虎嚥似的大嚼中，除夕已悄悄地逝去了，時間之神又把元旦帶到了人間，凛冽的朔風雖然在太空裏呼嘯，但村鎭七的動態畢竟顯露着新春的氣象了。</p>
<h3>新的降臨</h3>
<p>— 柳收</p>
<p>僅隔了不多的時辰，以前的一切都被埋葬了，被驅逐了！祇有「新」，充滿了這個世界，帶來了新鮮光明！</p>
<p>誰都等待着，祈求着：這新的降臨。「新」主持着這世界，主持着一切的人們！</p>
<p>人間，大地上，到處有着活潑美麗的胚，在「新」裏滋長着，忘去了過去的罪惡，過去的羞恥，過去的煩惱，過去的……</p>
<p>「新」賜給我們無限的愉快，極大的樂趣，使我們奮發，光揚；猶如溫柔的和風，吹醒了花朶，瑩瑩的露珠，滋長了草木，一切都在「新」的降臨中蘇醒，在蓬勃地生長着，</p>
<p>宇宙間，或者黑暗已消散了吧！能見到的祗有光明，能存在的也祗有光明！</p>
<p>是英雄用武之地，偉大的人們作戰的時候，這如大海中的孤舟，遙見到燈塔的光亮，如上山的旅人，到了高出的頂巓。</p>
<p>就是「新」，牠將使我們凱旋，替我們唱讚美的歌，祝頌的詞。「新」指示了我們美滿的命運，誰都戀着「新」愛着「新」！</p>
<p>這是新的降臨的時候，但是我們却不知道牠去的時候。我們祇有在現在，開始建造我們的新事業。</p>
<p>新來了，降臨了！頹唐的人，給他們注射了淸血針，消極的人，飲到了對症的藥劑。惟有「新」，牠能逐走了大羣的鬼怪，殺死了億萬的病菌。</p>
<p>新降臨了，人們都踏上征途吧！</p>
<h3>船</h3>
<p>— 楊彥岐</p>
<p>因爲自已住在「島」上，所以便想起了船。</p>
<p>在交通工具之中，我最喜歡的是船；因爲船是航行在大海裏的，我愛廣闊無垠的大海；而欣賞海景却非坐船不可，所以我愛船，沒有別的理由。</p>
<p>夏天，想像中的夏天，坐在甲板上望海面反映出的夕陽，多够味！可是現在是冬天。冬天，冷的風，重的風，刺臉的風，發在的風，在海面上，吹起波濤，讓波濤跳起來，跳在空中，像乒乓球落在大理石上似的。這也是海的景色，活的海景，並且，躺在一葉扁舟上，才能領略其中情趣。</p>
<p>船，輪船，汽船，帆船，救生船都是水上的東西。而水呢，捉不住，抓不緊，飄着，流着，永遠沒有停留的一天。地球轉着，太陽照着，月亮映着太陽的亮光，星點閃着，人類永遠在地面蠕動，船也永遠在水面游着，游着，游着，直到來日。</p>
<p>人生不就是一葉船嗎？從這邊渡到對岸，就算一生。如果船在半途覆沒，那祇好永遠滅亡；如果有血肉，有生命，那就掙扎，克服風浪，扯緊高帆，把住船舵，讓和平跟安靜從困難中擠出來。</p>
<p>海上靜了，水面平了，等待着對岸的光明。</p>
<p>天堂？地獄？沒有船來擺渡，那天能够把脚站穩？東幌幌，西幌幌，兩眼呆瞪着對岸的燈光，空待着，一輩子的空待着。</p>
<p>槳划起來，船才會動，才會在水面浮動，也才會往前面的海港進行。</p>
<p>法國的波特蘭爾（C．Bandclaire說：『海港是給一個倦於人生的艱苦者的渝快住處。遼遠的天，變幻的雲，不定的海色，和燈塔的光亮，組成一幅美景，足以使眼睛樂此不倦。織長的船，帶着隨波搖動的一些錯粽的帆索，足以使心靈保持着喜愛韻律的美的趣味。而對沒有野心和好奇心的人們，那裹有一種神秘，尊貴的樂趣。安坐樓頭，或靠在岸邊攔杆上，靜觀那些人的活動：有些是開船出發，有些是駛回來，有些還有着意欲之力，想去旅行，或想去發財。』</p>
<p>這『一幅美景』，這『神秘尊貴的樂趣』，在海上，在船中，也在我們眼前，更在我們腦中。</p>
<p>我們也有『欲之力』呢，不是去旅行，不是想發財，是想撑起大船，克服波浪，打平一切害人的魔濤，毀滅一切沒公理的惡鬼；讓一葉小舟，靜靜的浮在太平洋上，看太陽消沉在西邊的美景裹。</p>
<h3>進城（上）</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>我們一夥，四個人。</p>
<p>一條長的田岸，漸漸丟到我們背後去了。前面，是一連片赭色的原野，乾枯的，無邊無際的。</p>
<p>頭上的雲，輕飄飄的，很薄，薄得有些透明，藍在在，像湖水，也像一顆藍寳石。</p>
<p>我們打「時疫病院」門口經過，我們的心打着顫，一條仇恨的結，糾纏着，像蛇，也像一枚釘釘在我們底胸瞠上。</p>
<p>那一座黑色的大屋子，眞是個吃人的大魔鬼吧！好大的傢伙！牠那黑粉牆，一排邊，陰慘慘的；長得可怕，老是走不完。</p>
<p>我們給昨天疲勞得沒有一點氣力，譙也不同誰　話。沉默了好久，老王把頭掉回去，望望那黑傢伙，嚥了一口吐沫，帶着蠻勁兒說：</p>
<p>「媽的！時疫醫院呢！騙鬼！燒死了多少活生生的人！」</p>
<p>走在我後而的，老林也搭話了：</p>
<p>一我的鄰舍才慘呢！一個拉黃包車的，害瘧疾，看看快好了，不知道怎的給他媽的什麼憲兵踹着錯兒啦，就這麼把他拖走了。眞虧好心呢！哈哈！一條命兒就完啦！送到這院裹，醫生搖搖頭，搖搖頭，給送到火葬塲上去；不由他堂客分說，幾個火把，預備現成的，幾陣烟，幾團火，一個活人便死了。活該！誰呌他害病呢！你跟他們講理去！」</p>
<p>我和老張都不曾答話。我們的心充滿着掛念和煩躁。</p>
<p>我們一夥給昨天疲倦折磨够了。</p>
<p>鬥士的烽火終於給我們舉起了。我們不相信自已的力量，但正義鼓勵着我們，安慰着我們。我們走上艱難的路途，每人手裏挺着一枝烽火，一枝光明的烽火呵，我們終於看見到光明了。烽火呢！我們現在還在手裏；砍斷了右手，還有左手；砍斷左手，我們依然還有心，依然有不死的靈魂。</p>
<p>那黑而且醜的醫院丟到老遠老遠的了，一抹大城橫在我們面前，我們的心活躍起來。</p>
<p>老王提醒着我們！</p>
<p>「我們走太快啦！你們誰也不想一想，慢慢兒走好哇！你們看，那小車兒呢？不曉得落到　兒去了。離近不是，離太遠也不行。」</p>
<p>眞的，那小車兒落後落太遠了。眞虧老王想起，不然我們就道麼老老實實的，大搖大擺進城，車兒呢，進了城，找不着我們，那可眞呌麻煩了。</p>
<p>「等那小車兒！」我們坐在一株紅葉樹底下，眼睛望着那密業叢的松樹林子，一片天，天下面—樹，茅草棚，偶而有幾頭荒寒的鳥兒。我們的眼睛跟着鳥兒溜，東邊來，西邊去，眼睛溜酸了。</p>
<p>我們焦急地互相問，怎麼還不來？</p>
<p>接着問兩决，三次……誰都在問，但誰也沒回答。</p>
<p>我沉默好久，才顫抖地問道：</p>
<p>「是出了岔兒嗎？」</p>
<p>「許是出了岔兒了。」</p>
<p>「不會！裝得滿好的麻袋，米，揑揑是米，搗破一個洞看，也還是米，他媽的××！知道裏面秘密！我發誓也不信！」</p>
<p>「嚇！這幾天路上××巡查的多呢！馬隊，汽車，坦克車，……戳破秘密，唉！那可糟啦！糟啦！」</p>
<p>老林儘歎氣。</p>
<p>我們頭低着，默默懷想。忽然從松樹林裏走出兩個人來了，樹叢給撥開，刷刷地想，由田岸轉上大路。一個瘦黃老頭兒和一個精壯小夥子，迎着我們跟前走來了。小夥兒停了停，「啊喲」呌了一聲，我們的夢境給他打破。</p>
<p>年靑小夥子說：</p>
<p>「糊塗！糊塗！唉！我那塊膏藥（通行證）忘記帶了，不好上城啦！」</p>
<p>老頭子臉上急得靑筋暴脹起來：</p>
<p>「你眞糊塗！嚇！別想進城啦！」</p>

<h3>上海公共租界納稅華人會</h3>
<p>— 陶樂勤</p>
<p>租界內　　理繼續</p>
<p>上海公共租界納稅華人會，成立於民國九年十月十四日。其於民國二十四年以前之史略，載在申報年鑑及上海市年鑑，恕不重叙，以簡篇幅。茲所應言若，爲該會於民國二十五年以後之狀况，及其在公共租界之地位，與其在政治上組織之特點。</p>
<p>該會於民國二十五年四月，以會員之增加與求選舉之經濟，由其代表大會，决議修改會章。其八十一代表之任期，由一年改爲二年；執行委員由二十二人增至三十五人：常務委員由三人增至五人；出席工部局之董事五人，先選留任五分之三，委員七人，先選留任七分之四，以期駕輕就熟，而深資望；任期仍均爲一年。</p>
<p>至該會在公共租界之地位，如以政治家眼光觀之，自然與納稅西人會相等；如以政治原則言之，應更無被歧視之餘地。惟中外人士中，似有發生以下之錯誤認識：</p>
<p>一，以爲該會尙未取得法律上承認：</p>
<p>二，以爲該會所選出席工部局之董事委員，爲代表納稅華人與工部局交涉事務之代表。</p>
<p>此種錯誤之認識，以歷史的與形式的原因，自屬容易發生。惟「不出代議士不納稅」之原則，爲政治意識最爲豐富之盎格羅薩克遜偉大民族所奉爲金科玉律，而寗死不肯放棄之第二生命。苟納稅人有參與政治之要求，則雖具任何大力，終難阻止。所以該會之成立大會，得於當時在南京路南首工部局所有之市政應內舉行。以英國不成文憲法爲例，該會已成爲在公共租界內與納稅西人會有同等效力之法律根據，而爲中國與有關係國所承認之團體矣。去年關於工部局中國董事委員之出處，更被依照中國政府與有關係國駐華代表之換文，具體的明文載入於公共租界之憲章。所尙足被認爲憾事者，卽該會對於工部局之報吿與預算决算，尙無形式上之通過與批准等手續，致此種錯誤認識之根源，尙有未盡剷除者。是所望於賢明之有關係者，努力予以糾正之。</p>
<p>關於第二點之錯誤認識，其原因則爲以公共租界爲外人治理之區。實則乃係容許外人在該指定區域內租地建築經商而已。所以凡屬在該區域之居民，如以股份公司爲例，同屬股東；工部局之董事會，相當於股份公司之董事會；工部局之董事會行爲，係整個的，不可分的，聯帶負責的，而不以國籍之不同，對外得取不一致之行爲。正如股份公司之董事會，共同對於全體股東負責。此旨旣明，自能認識公共租界納稅華人會所選出席工部局之董事委員，並非代表納稅華人與工部局交涉事務之代表，而係工部局之一員，至於向工部局，代表納稅華人有所申訴或要求，自應由該會負其責任，而絕無且絕不能有所旁貸者。</p>
<p>政治團體之組織，最要之特點，爲儘量容納各方面之份子，俾得儘量代表各方面之意見與願望。倘其組織，能具有此種特點，政治人羣之間，可以收融洽合作，和衷共濟之效。反之，卽有一方面或數方面之被歧異待遇，則必致軋轢不安。政治之終極目的，爲謀全體入羣之幸福，而非僅謀少數或某部人羣之幸福。以此緣由，世界上有權威之思想家，政治家，法學家，均在著書立說，紛紛提出改進政治團體組織之種種建議。</p>
<p>世界上現行之政治組織，在歐戰以前之代表制度，爲代表人口與代表地方者兩種，而分立爲上下兩院，以形成國會。歐戰以後，受英儒數理哲學家羅素氏行會代表制度之影饗，漸有撥用職業代表制度者。蓋戰前之代表制度，僅爲橫面的，，而無縱面的：戰後則兼及縱面的。但於歐戰後，受美國大總統威爾遜氏出之「民族自决」口號所致之影響，兼有代表民族之度之設置者，祇有蘇聯。</p>
<p>上述之縱橫代表制度，武育幹氏在東方雜誌著論文，備極贊揚。而上海公共租界納稅華人會之組，恰先二年已實行之；具見事屬眞理，實際理論，必能一致。</p>
<p>考該會會員，分團體的個人的兩種。團體的會員，內含商業團體，同鄉團體，與市民團體三種。選舉分三組：個人會員組，同鄉團體組，（市民團體屬之），及商業團體組。所有代表八十一人，分由三組各選三分之一，卽每組選二十七人。個人會員，可謂代表執有七百元以上之地產，或納滿地捐或房捐十四元以上者；市民團體，可謂代表市民之全體：商業團體，可謂代表事業的集團；同鄉團體，可謂代表類乎民族之各帮。如是則八十一代表所成之代表大會，可謂包含公共租界內全體華人之代表矣。</p>
<p>關於該會之組織系統，爲（一）納稅華人，（二）代表大會，（三）執行委員，（四）常務委員，（五）主席。其活動方式，則例行公事，由主席批准卽行；重大者，由常務委員會議决定；更重大者，由執行委員會議决定；特別重大者，由代表大會决定。凡非例行公事而以有時間性關係，不得不撥用緊急處分者，則由主席逕行批行後，分別提請各會議追認。</p>
<p>迄今該會已有十八年之歷史，其間所遇盤根錯節，不知凡幾。而能得有現狀者，論人，則王儒堂，虞洽卿，林康侯，袁履登，李馥蓀，貝淞孫，錢新之，吳蘊齋，史量才，徐新六，胡孟嘉，王曉籟，徐寄廎，江一平，奚玉書，（恕不全叙），諸先生之急公好義，不斷努力；論事，則本正義公道，權義相等之理，採坦白之行動，於不妨害主權之下，力求中外納稅人之合作，以期界內市民，在工部局法治之下，獲得日新月異，人類應有之幸福。該會以十八年之經騐，深感平等合作，不特市政，一切問題，均可迎刃而解。且爲必要也。　民國二十七年十二月二十日</p>

<p>農業</p>
<p>六省總面積計二十六萬萬畝、已耕地面積計三萬一千七百萬畝、佔總面積百分之十五、各省狀况以廣西爲最高佔百分之二十五、雪南爲最低佔百分之四、其他如廣東佔百分之十二、湖南佔百分之十三、貴州佔百分之八、四川佔百分之十五、農產以稻類爲主秈粳稻合計佔全國產量百分之四十七、其中以廣東省居第一位、四川省次之、湖南省又决之、絲茶二物雖爲江浙皖等省之特產、西南各省自遠不逮、然川粤之絲、湘滇之茶、亦頗有名、此外重要農產尙可一述者、厥爲桐油、四川一省每年產量增達六十萬擔、至於棉花產量均甚微、四川的七十五萬擔、湖南的四十萬擔、廣東則僅六千擔、</p>

<p>交通</p>
<p>六省鐵路錢旣不敷用叉缺乏連絡、而其他運輸工具亦未達完善之境、故欲開發西南富源、首宜從事建設、（一）鐵路最近政府動工之鐵路爲四川叙府至雲南昆明之川滇路、雲南昆明至英屬緬甸之滇緬路、湖南株州至貴州貴陽之湘黔路、貴州貴陽至雲南昆明之滇黔路、在計劃中者有川康·桂越·桂黔·粤桂·寳成·等路、（二）公路、西南公路較他省發達、六省共有可以通車之路綫的二萬七千公里，佔全國四分之一、如贛滇路·川桂路·桂閩路·湘桂路·川湘路·川滇路·粤贛路·鄂港路·湘鄂路·挂滇路·陝康路·桂越路·川鄂路·等、新近完成者爲滇緬路、</p>

<h3>一年來的事業</h3>
<p>— 淞咸</p>
<p>從全面抗戰以來，中國的出版事業，受到非常嚴重的打擊。就幾家最大的出版公司而言，像商務，中華，世界，開明等，因戰事所受的損失，大可驚人。如開明，虹口的總廠，完全被砲火所燬；世界的總廠，也至今被佔。商務中華等總公司的損失，雖沒有這樣的大，但各地的分支店，因了許多城市的淪陷，幾乎有五分之三以上，都做了戰神的犧牲品。其直接的損失，像貨品，建築物等，合計起來，固然已經相當的巨大；其間接的損失却還要加倍。大家都知道書業的同行放帳，向來很多，平時因爲新舊銜接的關係，不會有怎樣的大出入。但經這决的戰爭，所有的販賣書店，也全數被燬，此等帳款幾乎永遠沒有收回的希望。把此等損失統計在一起，我們不妨說，所有此等出版公司的全部股本，大概都被這决的戰事侵蝕盡凈了！</p>
<p>一般的文化人，對於戰興以來各大出版家的沈寂狀態，頗多表示不滿，甚至以爲他們未能充分認識抗戰前途，在工作上缺乏膽識與信心的。然而，倘使能够明瞭他們這種驚人的損失，恐怕也不會有如此過嚴的責備吧。</p>
<p>從直接抗戰中心的一方面看，各大出版家似乎都缺少熱烈：然而實際上，他們工作的緊張，不但不减於戰前，甚至比戰前更甚。我們知道抗戰以來敎育的摧毁之大，然政府始終努力維持，不使停頓。各處戰区內的學校，都紛紛遷移到比較安全的內地，繼續開學。畢校所用的敎本，至今還仍然能够供給，不能不說是他們的努力所致。</p>
<p>八一三的前一星期，敎育部曾經召集上海各大出版家，在京開會。在會中，通知戰事卽將發生，應速將機械貨物趕緊運往內地。但這時局面已經十分緊張，各種交通運輸的工具，感到非常缺乏，事實上早已無法移動、到了戰事勃發發以後，敎育部又派員到滬，勸令各出版機關隨同遷廠委員會遷往武漢，當時商務中華開明生活各家，都隨同遷移。其結果，也有安全到達的，也有中途被炸沈沒的，也有被刦而去，不知下落的。統計起來，仍然損失的居多。到了戰區擴大，各地印成的敎本，大量的被燬，就不能不在滬港兩地加緊添造。一方面，造成的書，又因交通困難的緣故，無法輸往需要的區域，也不得不多方的盡力，從這種種方面看，此等出版家的艱困，是不能不寄與相當的同情的了。</p>
<p>除了幾家大出版公司以外，其他各出版家，也都在種種方面盡着各樣的努力。如生活書店和上海雜誌公司等，在川漢粤各地，努力於抗戰小冊和定期刋的出版。戰後新興的，如上海的復社，珠林書店，風雨書屋，漢口的大路書店等，也頗做了不少的工作。在這一年中所出的大部書籍，如「魯迅全集」，「列寗選集」，「資本論」等，大抵成於此等資本並不十分雄厚的出版家，這不能不說是空前的收穫。</p>
<p>就定期刋物而言，戰興以後，各大出版家的雜誌，多數停頓，這一點也頗受各方的責難。這和各地風起雲湧的新定期刋相對照，似乎不能不看做奇怪的現象。倘使定期刋的出版，是一種營利事業，爲什麼停刋的各家肯坐視利益的損失？吾則倘使是賠本的事情，爲什麼新期刊反會特別的增多？據我們所知道，此等停刋的雜誌，其基本的定閱者，多的往往到兩三萬，少的也大抵不下四五千，在營業的立塲上說，當然比沒有基礎的新刋物有利的多。然而他們的不能不停刋，也就在這一點上。爲了定閱者的衆多，爲了營業區域的廣泛，他們刋物的前行便不能限於一地。一方面又因爲內地印刷機關的缺乏，不能各地分印；，一方面又因爲交通的阻滯，郵遞的困難，使甲地出版的雜誌不容易到達乙地的讀者之手，而又不免受到讀者的責難。這實在是他們停刋的主因。</p>
<p>這許多話，好像是替幾家大出版公司辯護。我們承認，他們目前那種沈寂的情形，是應該受到責難的。但他們在戰爭中所受的損失，和他們爲國家，爲民族的努力，似乎也有使一般人瞭解的必要。</p>
<p>也許有人說，照這樣的情形，中國的出版事業，不是將完全毁滅了麼？這却不然。據我們的觀察，不但不會毁滅，反而因此得了新生的途徑，。在從前，各出版家的營業目光，大都專注在江浙皖鄂閩廣等文化比較發達的區域，而忽略了偏僻的內地。此等畸形的發展狀態，實在是很不合理。因了這决的戰事，文化重心內移，出版事業也跟着向從來不曾注意的偏僻區域發展。所以戰事結束之後，出版業營業的發展，一定可以比較前增加數倍，各地的文化將從畸形的變到合理的發達，這實在是很可樂觀的。</p>

<h3>上海之圖書館</h3>
<p>— 博生</p>
<p>我國人素喜藏書，然常爲私人之積蓄，而不公諸大衆。圖書館之制，起自西歐，而上海以開關商埠之故，圖書館制度卽隨歐人而至。淸道光二十七年耶蘇會傳敎士定居於徐家灣時，卽開始搜集圖書以供參考，九十年後之今日，已成爲著名之徐匯藏書樓矣。樓中藏有我國各省志書，一千六百十餘部；著名報紙，如申報。新聞報，東方雜誌等亦均保存全份：西書則有八萬冊。道光二十九年英租界中西僑組織一書會，至咸豐元年，卽擴張而成爲「上海圖書館」。民國元年該館名譽秘書塞斯麻理士（Sausmares）與工部局總董葛萊（Gray）一度磋商之後，决定將上海圖書館所有書籍，贈與工部局，卽成爲今日工部公衆圖書館。該館初俗名爲洋文書院。光緒三年二月八日申報紀載該館云：「本埠西人，設有洋文書院，計藏書的有萬卷，每年又添購新書五六百部。閱者止須每年費銀十兩可隨時取出披閱，閱畢繳換，此眞至妙之法也。」</p>
<p>不僅介紹該館，且復大有鼓勵圖書館制度之意。今該館藏書，中西合計，已有二萬三千餘冊；至其歷年閱覽人數及借出書冊數目，可檢閱工部報吿冊。</p>
<p>同治十年亞洲文會北中國支會會所落成，所中劃一部爲圖書館，專藏東方之圖書，至民國二十年止，計其所藏，西文者一萬五千冊，中文者一千冊</p>
<p>以其所述爲上海最早之圖書館，且至今並存者。至於國人熱心於圖書館事業，當入民國以後之事。民國四年敎育部頒布通俗圖書館規程十一條，頗引起世人之注意。同年學校方面，卽有南洋中學圖書館，東吳法律學院圖書館之成立，商業機關方面，則有中華書局圖書館。民國七年，有交通大學圖書館，松坡圖書館。八年有靑年協會圖書館。九年有靑年會圖書館。圖書館事業，已漸上發展之途矣</p>
<p>民國十三年爲上海圖書館恊會組織之年，在恊會組織前後數年間，圖書館事業，頗似旭日東昇，極現蓬勃之象，聊舉數端，以作證據：（一）公開圖書館之迭起。民國十一年上海市商會之商業圖書館成立，且公諸大衆。民國十五年商務印書館之東方圖書館實行開放。（二）機關圖書館之成立。民國十八年有第一區黨部圖書館，民國二十年有海關圖書館相繼成立、（三）學校圖書館之盛行。民國十年大同大學圖書館，民國十一年復旦大學圖書館，民國十二年淸心。民立兩中學圖書館，民國十三年持志大學圖書館，民國十五年光華。大夏兩大學圖書館，民國十六年暨南大學圖書館，民國十七年震旦大學圖書館等相繼成立。以上所述，只爲有名學校之圖書館耳。蓋圖書館事業旣風行，中小學校亦類多成立圖書館，然考其內容；亦有僅一圖書室而已。</p>
<p>當圖書館事業發展之時，遇一極不幸之事，卽民國二十一年一二八之役，東方圖書館完全化爲刧灰也。東方圖書館之前身，爲涵芬樓。涵芬樓者，商務印書館所設，以供其館中編輯者參考之用，於光緒三十年該館成立時已啟其端：主其事者爲張元濟氏，經二十年張氏之蒐集藏書達數十萬冊。民國十三年商務印書館特於其工廠之對面，建立、一大厦，名之曰東方圖書館，以所藏三十四萬冊書籍，公諸社會，乃爲上海圖書館中第一，卽以志書言，達二十二省之多，計的二千六百四十一種，在全中國圖書館中佔藏志書數之第三位。豈知倭寇侵入，該館無數珍貴圖書悉遭焚燬。民國二十一年八月一日該館復業，二十二年四月五日，該館董事會，卽議决凖備復興東方圖書館，</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>惜蘆溝橋事變突起，中日戰爭至今未已，東方圖書館未能早日恢復也。</p>
<p>敎育部雖於民國四年卽已頒佈各省治縣治應設通俗圖書館，然上海市立圖書館直遲至民國十九年始有名爲市立流通圖書館之成立，規模甚小。翌年春，市政府撥款二萬五千元，命市敎育局建立市圖書館於文廟，是年十二月該館館所落成，二十二年一月開放。民國二十二年秋，吳鐵城市長發起籌建一大市立圖書館於市中心，設籌備委員會積極從事。至民國二十四年七月中，該館館所落成，位於市中心區域行政區，在府前右路與府南右路之間，府西路之南，坐西朝東，與博物館相對。平面作「工」字形而於前部兩端橫展向前後突出，成廂屋然。南北兩端極大距額的六十六公尺，建築面積的一千六百二十平方公尺，各層面積合計的三千四百七十平方公尺，容積的一萬六千立方公尺。館屋之外觀取現代建築與中國建築之混合式樣。館內布置均極考究。書庫亦均裝鋼製新式書架，其書籍排列之總長，的一萬五千公尺，可容圖書的四十萬卷。民國二十五年五月一日該館正式成立，六月一日吳市長邀本市藏書家。敎育界。新聞界及籌備期間協助該館之各界人士前往該館參觀，並舉行茶會。六月八日開放兒童閱覽室，至九月一日起，全部開放。是館本可爲上海市立之最大圖書館，且最有前途者，豈料八一三倭寇突起，至今淪陷於敵人之手，成狐窟鬼穴矣。</p>
<p>自日閥對華侵略戰起後，上海文化事業一落千丈。各大學校非遷移內地，卽搬至租界，侷促於住家之房屋中，圖書館設備毫無，莘莘學生，每苦無書可供參考。無錫丁福保氏特公開其所藏書於白克路之醫學書局，嘉惠士林不少：惜丁氏之書，大多爲國學書籍，近代科學以及西文書報未能是備。鴻英圖書館剪報工作甚久，惜仍在籌備期中，未能公開。目前可供學者參考利用者，爲：</p>
<p>海關圖書館</p>
<p>工部局公共圖書館</p>
<p>震旦圖書館</p>
<p>徐家匯藏書樓</p>
<p>亞洲文會圖書館</p>
<p>法文協會圖書館</p>
<p>中國國際圖書館</p>
<p>靑年協會圖書館</p>
<p>靑年會圖書館</p>
<p>基督敎大學聯合圖書館</p>
<p>明復圖書館</p>
<p>丁氏圖書館</p>
<p>中國流通圖書館</p>
<p>丁香圖書館</p>
<p>上列各圖書館，徐匯藏書樓，須有介紹，方可入覽。海關圖書館以英文之經濟商業書籍爲多。明復圖書館，設於中國科學社內，所藏之二百餘種科學雜誌，共計三萬餘冊，最爲珍貴，研究科學者，可向是館進行。中國國際圖書館係由世界社原有圖書館改組而成，今仍在福開森路世界社原址，所藏書偏於國際關係一方面者。震旦圖書館以法文書籍爲多，靑年協會圖書館與靑年會圖書館則以基督敎書籍爲多。讀者可就本文所述各圖書館之性質，分別利用之也。</p>
<h3>上海之博物院</h3>
<p>— 致遠</p>
<p>書籍所紀載之事事物物，車載斗量，設無實物以資證明，則人類之活動痕跡，只成爲紙上之空文，因是而有博物館之制度，所以輔圖書之缺也。上海博物館之創始，當推天主敎法國神甫韓德（PereHeude）於淸同治六年杪所創立之徐家匯博物院，其决爲皇家亞洲文會北中國支會於同治十三年所創設之上海博物院。上海市政府鑒於博物館之重要，於民國二十二年秋，動議建設一博物館於市中心，二十六年正式開幕，上海始有國人市立之博物館焉。茲將上海之三大博物館分別述其經過如决。</p>
<p>（一）韓德博物院（震旦博物院）</p>
<p>韓德神甫爲一生物學家，於同治六年十二月至滬，見徐家匯天主堂中已略略收藏生物標本，决定加以擴充而成立一博物館。韓神甫蒞滬未久，卽赴中國內地考察，而於長江流域，允加注意。每决返滬必有大量奇異標本携歸。爲搜集麋鹿，特往西北各地，所得成績，極爲巨大，其「說鹿」一書，已成爲世界生物學名著之一矣。光緒九年，始建院舍於徐家匯耶穌會總院之南，貯藏標本，每日午後，准人參觀不取遊資。當時樓下貯獸類及魚鳥骨骼，樓上貯甲蟲。貝介。獸類之剝製。禽鳥及蛇類。韓神甫主持此院凡三十年，嗣後由柏永年神甫（PereConrtois）主任後爲松梁材神甫（Pere　Savio）主任今爲鄭璧爾神甫（PerePiel）所主持，惟松神甫仍在院中任硏究員。</p>
<p>日積月累，標本愈集愈多，舊舍不敷應用，乃於民國十九年興工建築大規模之院舍於震旦大學地址內。院凡三層，每層總長度的爲八十公尺，內分陳列室三，以及硏究室，試騐室，圖書室，攝影室等。院舍之南，另闢植物園一所，培植花木，以供硏究。民國二十二年冬開放，規定每星期日。一·三·四·五·六各日之下午二時至五時爲參觀時間，門券二角。今所公開展覽者，爲第一第二陳列室。第一陳列室中所陳列者爲中國古物。此種古物係士山灣育嬰堂葛修士所蒐集。古物分金屬類。玉器類。陶瓦類，及刺繡等物。室之北端陳列崇明謝家鎭黃泉口之遣形，最爲引人注意。泉口係淸順治舉人，卒於康熙十六年。民國六年時，其後裔掘其墳，屍未朽，衣衾如新，夫人林氏亦然。柩爲葛修士所得，以木塑泉口像，穿以原有之殮衣，旁置柩中各物。所陳列之刺繡一伴，爲上海名物顧繡之一種，所謂空繡是也。第二陳列室爲生物，如犀熊　鹿之哺乳類·鳥類·爬蟲類·兩棲類·魚類·軟體動物類·昆蟲。均具備。鳥類標本，裝置精美，栩栩欲活，昆蟲標本亦極考究，蓋該館近正注意昆蟲之工作也。植物標本另闢植物專室，共有標本五萬件。又該館所出之各種書籍，極其充實，頗得世界專門學者所欽佩。</p>
<p>（二）上海博物院</p>
<p>上海博物院在公共租界博物院路二十號亞洲文會北中國支會四樓及五樓。該院創立於同治十三年，迄今已六十餘年。歷任名譽監院，多係博物學家與生物學家，現任名譽監院沙韋佩（Sowerby）尤爲巨擘。故院中陳列品多爲生物標本，雖美術品與古物亦屬不少。物品來源及地域、，多係屬中國，蓋該院係以硏究中國爲對象者也。該院第一任名譽監院爲朴來阿（W．B.Pryre）光緒元年十月初七日申報曾有新聞紀述該院云：</p>
<p>「泰西各大城池夙有成例，凡在該地方人，必公建一院，將飛禽走獸以及各動物並列於內，以便博物者隨時賞玩。如在府城，則將闔郡之物實之；如在都城，則將天下之物實之，名日博物院。現在旅居上海之西商亦倣效泰西規模，在本埠設立一院，將中國與東洋各物齊集院中，事雖創始，而所羅列者已不少。計屬毛蟲者，有震澤湖旁之野猪；羽族者，有鷹鵲麻雀等；又有水族中名物，不能殫述。餘如螳螂。蚱蜢。蝴蝶之類亦各分其種，各標其名。每一物伴係從何處得來，何人相贈，必書明懸貼於上。中外人有往觀者，俱不取値也。珍藏羽毛各類，西國向有妙法，雖皮已乾枯，而毛可不落。現在此法，華人已得之；且又從外國購到玻璃眼睛，故無論是何異獸珍禽，一經裝點，便栩栩然大有生氣。凡院內一切，俱係博物之西人所供給。其總理斯事者，卽元芳洋行朴來阿君也。」</p>
<p>博物院路，原名係園明園路，租界市政當局以重視該院之故，乃卽改今名。自光緒三年起，工部局幷按年捐款補助該院。</p>
<p>（三）上海市博物館</p>
<p>上海市博物館之建議，時在民國二十二年之秋。其經費係出自市公債中，劃定該館建築費爲三十萬元。其建築外觀與市圖書館相倣，位於圖書館之對面。兩館遙遙相對，適成市政府之左右兩翼。二十四年春，該館籌備會推定一臨時董事會董理之。董事長爲葉恭綽氏。葉氏素愛好藝術，且善於治理</p>

<p>事務，故主持該館，遊刃有餘。董事會中决定該館性質，以藝術歷史爲主，而歷史允須以上海爲中心</p>
<p>該館建築工程於二十四年雙十節吿竣。其內部佈置，大略如决。（一）地面層，中央入口處爲門廳，寬約十七公尺半，長的十四公尺登樓之梯級及衣帽售品等室附焉。由此向內爲大廳，寬的十一公尺半，長的十八公尺。廳中陳列鄕賢陸深石刻四大方，壁間懸上海名物顧繡掛幅十二幅，復置二鐘，鐘能指示上海時間與世界各國時間之對照。大廳內爲第一陳列室。廳兩旁爲廊。兩廊均陳列上海各種之文獻。廊通前部左右兩翼之辦公室。左翼突出處爲圖書館；右翼突出處爲演講廳。（二）第二層，中央分兩部前爲藝術部置一大傀儡戲台，後部爲歷史部陳列服飾·用具·音樂·剌繡，而歷代髮結模形，尤引人注意，兩廊亦爲歷史部陳列物。兩翼光綫最好，則陳列書畫磁器銅器陶器，爲藝術部集中點。（三）中央二層前面陳列廳之上有夾層，地面與後半部平屋頂相齊，由此循露天梯級達第四層之門樓。門樓四週亦設平臺，以便遠眺。大廳之下有地室，爲設置鍋爐等之用。民國二十五年四月間，該館以中國建築展覽會揭幕，參觀者人山人海，咸極佩嘆。二十六年一月，該館正式公開，滬上中外人士前往參觀者日數千，市中心區車馬不絕於途。七月七日爲上海市紀念竸賽，市政府所屬機關協力舉行各種展覽會，以爲慶祝。該館所舉行者，爲上海文獻展覽會，出品極精良，且有系統，最爲各界所讚美，不圖是</p>
<h3>一年來上海樂壇</h3>
<p>— 種樂</p>
<p>隨着「八，三」的砲聲，許多上海的藝人們紛紛離滬，又由於環境的關係，一九三八年中上海的音樂工作無論從那方面說都是頗爲寂寞的。</p>
<p>我們姑從國人的學校，電影，會堂，和出版界各方面作一個鳥瞰。</p>
<p>學院方面，國立音專已爲環境關係而停辦，另外改設了一個私立的音專，敎員一仍其舊，但最良好的敎授黃自先生不幸與世長逝，又有許多優秀的靑年至戰地服務，音專於是重招大批的新生；新生的音樂程度當然差些，音專的敎授們不得不加倍努力。在蕭友梅先生的領導之下，全體師生頗能合作，儘量使虛空了的後方的樂擅早日能得到新的兵丁。</p>
<p>較小的音樂館則有陳又新了善德的上海音樂館，章彥寳立動黃貽均黃廷貴的光明音樂館，都曾開過一决演奏會。私人執行昔樂敎育業務者鋼琴有夏國瓊，提琴有陳中，潘伯岩，聲樂有陳歌辛，斯義桂，長笛有葉懷德，大提琴有張貞黻，各方面的有張昊，裘夢痕，瞿立中等。</p>
<p>電影方面作揷曲的人很多，但大半是一業餘」的作曲家。嚴工上，是一貫其崑曲情調的，「人魚公主」比較易唱；吳村做了一首在各舞塲很流行的「四季花開」，有民謠的風味；陳鳴皐爲「女人」作的一些曲雖有畢究氣，始終不失爲較爲純正的作品，雖然演奏者很不能歷任；陳歌辛的「桃色新聞」和「春風野草」是兩首絕佳的情歌，當然離開戲的時候是會因時代關係而失去牠們的意義的；黎錦暉脫離了他舊的生活之後，到重慶去致力於他新的生活，上海却留着他的令弟黎景光在電影　作曲中繼續他哥哥的舊路。</p>
<p>演奏會開得很少。我們能記得的有上海音樂館，光明音樂館的混合的音樂會，譚小麟爲紀念黃自先生開的浪悼音樂會；實騐管絃樂隊奏了好些國人的作品，僅僅說技巧上的成就，也只有譚小麟的幻想曲可以記取。光明，中華，聯合，上海四個口琴會都開過一决音樂會，節目大半是所謂「流行曲」或是「純藝術」的東西，除了中華和上海有過陳歌辛的「春天」即「渡過這冷的冬天」，及中華較多進行曲外，其餘的連進行曲也太少了。但由於演奏所得救濟難民，我們可以說他們是盡一部分責任的。</p>
<p>在趙梅伯的指揮下的二百五十人的合唱「聖城」也是值得一提的。雖然有不能使人十分滿意的地方，趙先生和道許多聖樂同志爲難民請命的企圖是無論如何不可抹煞的。</p>
<p>出版方面，也不多見。抗戰歌曲，只見翻印，電音歌曲之類的刊物倒有·徐遲出過三期「純文藝」，有陳歌辛的「煩憂」和「水風車」；自學」上有許多組慰的比較上內容前進的歌曲；音專出過三期「音樂月刋」，有李維寗敎授等譜的曲和一些音樂雜文；音樂世界也介紹些美術詩歌，比較上只有「風雨中搖籃歌」是有時代感些。</p>
<p>雖然，由於藝人們認識的逐漸淸楚，各演奏家，作曲家和各團體已在進行團結，到來　有更積極的工作可做。各歌詠團和口琴會將在同一的使命下像藝人們一樣排除意見，而且合作起來。出版者將發行大批的配合時代的詩歌新作。華美晨報上一度傳說的音樂週刋也會出版。許多專家已允放棄其學究的著作而爲這大時代的民衆寫作。樂人們儘量在戲劇中，電影中，學校中爭取他們的地位和應盡的工作。讓我們在這里預祝這「孤島」的藝術之「春花的開放」！</p>
<p>聖約翰大學</p>
<h3>新聞學系略史</h3>
<p>— 陶啟湘</p>
<p>全國首先創始新聞學職業敎育者，即爲上海聖約翰大學。該校長卜舫　博士，於一九二一年（民國十年）　請上海每週評論報（Weekly　Review）（按即現在之密勒氏評論報）China　Weekly　Review）營業主任唐派德森先生（Mr.Donpatterson）在校中祖任新聞學講師，敎授新聞採訪及撰寫；即爲中國新聞學課程之最早者。並爲該課程學生實習起見，由校方創辦小型英文週報一種，記戲與聖的翰有關係之各項消息，定名爲的翰日規（The　St.　John's　Dial），亦稱</p>
<p>次年（民國十一年），武道先生（Mr.　Maurlee　E.　Yotaw）由美來華，加入的翰大學爲新聞學正式敎師。唐派德森及武道兩君，均爲美國密蘇里大學（University　of　Missouri」新聞學院畢業生，而密蘇里大學之新聞學院，即爲全世界所首創者。</p>
<p>由一極簡陋之開端以至於今日，在此十八年中，我國靑年對於新聞學之興趣，日見增加。約翰畢業生中曾讀新聞課程者，今日多服務於吾國各地報館及通訊社，成續素爲各界所稱道。此决申報出版新年特刋，其中一部稿件卽爲現在在校習新聞課程者所採集撰述，此輩學生，亦即爲日後中國新聞界之先進也。</p>
<p>聖的翰天學之新聞學系，在華東現仍爲唯一者，其他大學如滬江，復旦等，雖亦曾有新聞系之設立，但未能連續辦理；現在滬江只有商學院尙有數新聞學科。自去年華東基督敎聯合大學成立，約翰之新聞課程除該校大三大四二級學生可以選修外，滬江，東吳，之江學生亦得選讀。</p>
<p>約大新聞系，每年有數科專門課程開班，由武道先生長該系一切。課程的爲「新聞採訪與撰寫」，「新聞編輯」，「世界新聞學簡史」，「廣吿學」，「廣告設計」，及「推銷術」等。各班人數由十餘人以至數上人不等。的翰週報即爲該系學生實習工具</p>
<p>本學年之的翰週報，雖然學校現址在慈淑大樓，學生皆爲通學，以致關於學校之新聞大爲减少，仍能繼續出版。內容則仍爲對於該校學生，敎職員及校友有興趣之稿件。現在該報編輯爲陶啟湘君。週報經濟完全獨立，報費由每學生所交出版費項下開支，另由聖約翰大學校友會訂購每期數百份，故該報雖無廣吿費之收入，仍能收支相抵也。出版期爲每星期三。</p>
<p>約翰大學當局，希望能於短時期內，設立一新聞學院，專門訓練靑年之有志於服務報界者，敎以歐美及中國最優良之有關新聞事業之學職，以擴充此悠久之學系工作範圍，並爲中國新聞及出版界，中英文報館，通訊社等造就出衆之人才。提高中國新聞界之水準，亦爲該學院之宗旨，以冀將來吾國之新聞界中人，能於國際競爭中，與各界領袖，同求吾國之國際地位及國家之復與也。創立新聞學院之建議，除華東各大學當局能極力合作外，如能得上海中西報界先進，加以贊助提倡，則其成功也可以預卜，而其成効亦可最大，蓋上海爲我國新聞及出版事業之軸心，自新聞界立塲而言，以後亦將繼續爲中國文化事業最重要地之一，故若能有新聞學院得報界相助，則前途定能無限也。</p>
<p>北平燕京大學之新聞系，爲全國規模最大者，聲譽久著於國內外，其最先草創時亦爲小規模者，後得賴華北及各地報界贊助，熱心謀其事務上之改革，由報界全組委員會籌募基金等，至今日成績良佳。約翰新聞學院之建議，如能得上海報界先進輔助，則其成立當可不生問題。</p>
<h3>上海出版界槪况</h3>
<p>— 華堃</p>
<p>開明書店</p>
<p>一　過去的歷史</p>
<p>一·創立的經過</p>
<p>開明書店的創辦人爲章錫琛先生，自民國十五年，在寳山路寳山里的家裏發行新女性雜誌，隨後又陸續刊布了許多新書。爲了要革除當時出版界的惡習，所以對於出版物的內容旣嚴加別擇，形式又講究美觀，定價也力求低廉，因此便得到了許多讀者的信仰。到了家庭中的出版組織不足以供社會需要時，童先生便聯合夏丐尊先生豐子愷先生等文化界有名之士合組書店。</p>
<p>二·業務上的擴大和出版的傾向</p>
<p>開明創辦以後，力求出版事業的改進，更得到了廣大讀者羣的信仰。到了民國十九年，私人組織的書店已不足以供社會的需要，於是開始擴展，改組爲股份有限公司。各地分支店也相繼設立。計有南京，杭州，廣州，漢口，武昌，長沙，北平，瀋陽，八處。總廠也因業務的擴展經過了數度遷移，後來定居於梧州路，資本額也由數百元逐漸加至三十萬元。</p>
<p>就出版的傾向說，最初是以中學生爲對象，「中學生」雜誌最足以代表這種傾向。</p>
<p>後來他們的業務擴展，出版方面也從中學生的對象擴展到小學生，新編的小學敎科書旣有獨創的精神，接着刊行的「新少年」雜誌更是介於小學和中學的中間讀物。同時又把出版的範圍擴展到各方面，和大學叢書同性質的專門著作，也陸續刊布了，有價値的古籍也相繼印行。如「二十五史」的縮印，「二十五史補編」的編刋，及「淸名家詞」的結集，允爲學術界所稱誦。那時因了人事的紛繁，世變的亟劇，報章雜誌便呈着雲蒸霞蔚現象，於是社會上人士很感到不能够周覽的缺憾，他們因此發行了　月報。」除了分立各種門類來容納各方面的重要材料外，又有特稿來分析研討各種重要的問題。這樣他們的出版傾向更加擴展了。</p>
<p>三·出版物的統計</p>
<p>他們究竟出版過了多少書籍呢？我們姑且做一個統計來看。下表是從民國十五年八月開始營業起，至二十七年十二月三十一日止的分類統計：種冊</p>
<p>總類　一六　六</p>
<p>哲學類　四二　四六</p>
<p>宗敎類　七　七</p>
<p>社會科學類　一七二　二七</p>
<p>語文學類　七六　一四七</p>
<p>自然科學類　九〇　一〇二</p>
<p>應用技術類　二〇　二〇</p>
<p>藝術類　九一　一一二</p>
<p>文學類　三〇〇　三九三</p>
<p>史地類　一〇三　一三三</p>
<p>總計　九一七一　二四二</p>
<p>（附註）各種雜誌及活葉文選均不計在內</p>
<p>二　現在和將來</p>
<p>二十穴年夏間，國民政府决心抗戰，上海書業界從敎育部得到了指示，要在最短的期間內，儘量的趕造成足够一二年應用的中小學敎本，並且要立刻運到內地去儲存。自然，開明書店不能例外，他們也正在虹口的廠內這樣工作着。雖則。那時抗戰的情緒一天天高漲，虹口的民衆每天像潮湧這樣的往虹口區外疏散。然而開明書店郤爲了工作的緊張，實在無暇顧及遷徙的問題。</p>
<p>八月十三日上午，神聖的全面抗戰展開了，尙在虹口廠內工作着的開明書店職工，直到聽見了砲聲方才不得不離開工作處所往外逃避。大的一星期以後，這許多已造成的和未造成的貨物，以及機器原稿等統被砲火所燬。後來戰事深入，凡是開明有分店地方，先後都成爲戰區，南京，杭州，廣州，漢口，武昌，長沙等分店於是不得不跟着撤退，（瀋陽和北平是早在六年前和一年前撤退了，）有的地方來不及撤退，便遭焚燬。僅就他們的有形的損失論，迸數目已經是不很小的了！</p>
<p>開明在出版界旣有十年以上的歷史和相當的地位，假使一旦被燬，即無以自立，不特表現自己的脆弱，並且無以對國家。他們雖沒有大資本家做靠山，然而他們還是在竭力的掙扎，圖過此艱苦的難關。他們仍舊在出版新書和重印已前出版各書，又在重慶，桂林，昆明，貴陽，萬縣等處設立新的分店。燦爛的將來必定在他們的前面，這是可以相信的。</p>
<h3>世界書局</h3>
<p>無論在歷史上，在規校上，以及對於文化的貢獻上，無疑的，世界商務中華三家，爲中國最大的出版家。八一三戰事開始，商務中華就先後運往香港，只有世界仍留在上海。</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>世界在福州路的發行所旣發生炸彈慘案於前，在虹口的總廠又一再發生大批存書被日方運走於後，經過情形，迭載中外各報，於是更引起了中央與各界對於世界熱烈的同情和關心。本報因出文化版新年增刊，所以特去訪問世界的當局，承他答話如下：</p>
<p>何以事前沒有計劃遷廠？</p>
<p>據他所答，世界和商務中華等同業，曾於民國二十五年春間，即向中央條陳遷廠的計劃，希望中央能予以相當的便利。其時世界擬遷於武昌，商務擬遷於長沙，中華擬遷於南昌，目的即在於各家分散各地，萬一國際戰事發生，可以避免出版界感受重大的脅威。但後來因中央與地方的種種問題，頗費周折，以致未有迅速的進行。至二十六夏間，中央難有意思要三大公司遷移，但不久蘆溝橋的事件就發生，時間已晚，不及遷移。後來商務中華就在香港就原有的分廠擴充範圍，而世界以爲如果在香港能有辦法，在上海亦必有辦法；換言之，一旦在上海無辦法，在香港亦必無辦法，所以就决定不再往香港另去設廠。這一點，根據他們一年餘來的經騐，已證明了他們當時的判斷，倒是很有見地的。現在他們在上海出版，與商務中華在香港出版，並無兩樣。而且在滬的開支，據說還可比在港的省儉一些；成本較輕，書籍的定價也就可以便宜一點。</p>
<p>現在如何出版？</p>
<p>他說，於八一三戰事開始，他們就在租界中區另覔相當的出版塲所。現在的生產能力，並不亞於戰前，只要有需要，他們仍能大量的供給。他們最近統計，戰事以來所出的各種新書，共計一百八十九種，平均仍是每三天出版新書一種，但這還是爲了戰區擴大，營業關係，特別限制的結果。所有各種再版書，無論敎科書，參考書，都照常十足準備，源源供給；對於內地各省用書，亦盡力設法運輸。現在倒是運輸最成問題，費用之大，往往十倍於前，而且時間遙遙無期，路上損失不包。這原不是他們一家如此，但聽他的話，眞是困難極了。</p>
<p>總廠何以有如許存書？</p>
<p>他說，因爲他們旣不及遷廠，便計割在內地各省存足數年的用書，不意事起倉卒，未及全數運出。報載被日方運走者已達六百餘萬冊，其實還不止此數，按總廠內實際存書共有三千餘萬冊，聞陸續被日方焚燬者，亦有千餘萬冊，廠前空地，積灰達尺餘之厚，眞是中國文化界空前的浩刦也。有何新的出版計劃？</p>
<p>他欣然的說，爲適應讀者需要，並謀自身復興，新的出版計劃很多。這裹可以報吿的，即從本年起，在可能範圍內，仍常恢復戰前大規模的出版新書。不久的將來，就有較多的新書可以發表；同時並歡迎各界投稿，或建議編輯計劃。他們要在刦灰中謀生長呢。</p>
<p>對於出版界的意見</p>
<p>他說，出版事業很雞辦，尤其在這種時期。第一點，就管理而論。中國的出版家，因種種關係，都採用編輯所，印刷所，發行所的三位一體制；因此，管理上非常複雜。例如，編輯和著作人都是文人，印刷和裝釘人都是武人，介乎其間不文不武的又有一批生意人；因此，常經理的要周旋於這樣的一個塲合中，眞是不甚容易，說句笑話，眞要「文武雙全」，吾則，就難免不顧此失彼。第二點，就資本而論。出版事業需要極大的資本，例如工廠設備，原料，未成品，總局存書，路上未達品，分局存書，客戶放帳等，共要六七批資本。爲了營業所及，遍於全國，上述各項，都耍極大的數量，才能應付，而且書籍不比花紗布疋等日常用品，可以隨時隨地抵押或變賣；因此，上述各項，又都要自己充分的資本，方能週轉、第三電。為了中國敎育的不發達，人民每年在書籍上的消費極少；因此，出版事業在中國，可說還在萌芽時期。</p>
<p>他雖說了出版界目前的種種困難，但仍時時表示着出版界前途的大可樂觀。唱世界雖遭遇着空前的浩刦，但他已在積極的計劃復興。像道樣的一翻談話，實在不但爲關心世界的人士所樂聞，而且很可以給各界遭着同樣境遇者一種極大的</p>
<h3>光明書局</h3>
<p>在動盪不安的新出版業中，像蝸牛般慢步前進着十數年如一日的要推光明書局了；光明的創立早在民十七大革命時代，它永遠走在時代的前面，出版過不少的新刊物。其中如中學各科參考書，文藝理論叢書，世界文學叢刊，社會科學叢刋，傳記叢書，單行本如中國近代史，政洽經濟學基礎敎程，現代語辭典，雜誌時代論壇，文學界，都曾得文化界好評。八一三全面抗戰發動後，它爲着推動後方戰時文化，在漢口支店出版了一套平心主編民族的解放叢書，廣州支店計劃的自由中國叢書和光明文庫，則因廣州的陷落，沒有完成。現在它在重慶柳州金華的三個支店，也都致力於戰時文化的推動工作，在上海則致力於出版國際問題和社會科學理論書，據聞即將出版的有幾部書頗値得向讀者報吿：（一）胡明譯的資本主義世界經濟地理，這是一部五十萬言的鉅著，有圖表一百五十幅，譯者化了十八個月苦心完成的。（二）汪耀三譯貨幣信用論敎程，這是G加茲羅夫編纂的集體寫作，長三十萬言。（三）平心著的各國革命史講話，這是一部以各國革命史實爲骨幹而以一氣呵成的筆法寫成的近二十萬空的著作，這三部書不但觀點非常正確，就是寫法也都十分新銳，誠爲目前出版界中不可多得的作品。</p>
<p>關於發行方面，它們因爲歷史較久，故發行網也比較廣遠，現在有許多新出版業和私人的出版物，都委託他們發行，而收到良好的効果的如遠東書報社出版的畫報，日本在中國的賭博，抗戰與革命，風雨書屋的海角遺編，建社的新智識叢書，和公論社的公論叢書，文獻社的文獻月刊等等。對於內地讀者和各地翻實家委辦或代定書報，它更能忠實地辦到「快」「廉」兩個字。在孤島上，它可說是文化事業的辛勤的播種者了。</p>
<h3>正中書局</h3>
<p>正中書局爲國內關心文化事業之名流學者集資所創設，成立於民國二十二年，其目的在以編印各種圖書，介紹國內外學術，發揚我國文化，促進我國科學敎育，而允以灌輸靑年學識，以期思想漸趨統一之途爲其指歸。開業後，已有大量圖書及雜誌出版，迄今前者已達千餘冊，後者亦有十餘種；且均風行宇內，博得全國學者好評，其間復以新頴材料，一貫中心，精當體別，整個計劃，遵照部定標準編成初高中師範，簡易師範等敎科書各一套。問世以來，大受敎界人士贊許，認爲敎育靑年之良好工具。去年蔣委員長西安半月記之發行，銷數達百萬冊，該局聲名遂遠播海外。該局初設總局於南京，各省市均已决第成立分局。去年戰事爆發，首都淪陷，該局即遷總局於武漢，雖受損綦重，但猶在困苦中奮力經營，仍有巨量新書出版，以應非常時期之需要。現該總局已由漢移至重慶，以爲西北西南營業中心，並在該地及香港二處，各設印刷廠一，所，繼續出書，港廠規模較大，業於呈准港政府後，積極工作產量之巨，足供東南各省之需，而有餘，此亦嘉惠士林之福音也。此外該局對川，甘，陝，桂，滇，　，等省分局亦已力謀充實，以利各該地圖書之流傳，滬，粤，浙，蘇，閩各處，亦均出分局或代售處，積極供應，期於戰事時期，盡其文化上之責任。</p>
<h3>長城書局</h3>
<p>長城書局成立於民國十九年，爲滬上敎育界及金融界人士所創辦。迄今已歷九載，專出版靑年修養書及實用參考書。選稿甚爲嚴格，故所出各書極受敎育界及社會人士歡迎。如「怎樣訓練你自己一，「怎樣修學一，「怎樣訓練思想」，「自我創造」，「蘇俄的生活」等書，均風行一時，各學校採用爲參考書及課外必修讀物者甚多。</p>
<h3>亞東圖書館</h3>
<p>— 汪孟</p>
<p>亞東圖書館創立於民國二年，迄今已有二十六年的歷史。在這時期中，我同業之由草創而旺盛，由旺盛而衰落，更由衰落而消滅者，正不知凡幾；亞東圖書館竟能歷千磨萬折而猶存，這是不能不引以自慰的事。</p>
<p>亞東圖書館最初的基礎，奠定於蕪湖，即所謂『科學圖書社」的就是。當時正値前淸光緒二、九年，維新空氣，至爲蓬勃，憂國之士，競以提倡科學爲救國之不二法鬥，而科學圖書社之創設，即是此種思潮的具體衣現。這一皖南文化重鎮，蕪湖人俗呼爲「科學圖」之亞東分館，一直到去年蕪湖陷落後，方吿消滅。</p>
<p>亞東並非富商投資專以牟利的企業，而是有志於文化事業者努力的結果：所以在出版方面，就從不以圖利爲第一與唯一的標準，因此，在過去二十餘年的中國文化與思想史上，亞東圖書館是有其相當的地位的。茲舉其較爲重嬰的史實數端於後：　孫中山先生於民國八年護法失敗之後，鑒於思想宣傳的重要，來滬創辦建睽雜誌，當時因環境關係，各書局都不代發行，唯我亞東毅然担任，承辦有兩年之久。</p>
<p>五四運動的文學革命，亞東會盡了牠最大的力量。新文學大師陳獨秀，胡適之等先生的主要著作，都是由亞東出版的。</p>
<p>民十四後中國社會科學的勃興，亞東也是一個有力的促成者。所出李季，高語罕，林超眞等先生的創作與介紹，於我國社會科學的影響，亦屬巨大。</p>
<p>他如激動過整個中國思想界的名著：科學與人生觀的論戰：在中國小說史上具有劃期意義的各種標點小說，以及關於考古，自然科學與文學的二百餘種譯著（許多被國內大中畢校採爲敎本），無一不出自海內名家的手筆，且具有相當永久的價値者。亞東圖書館過去的努力是無人能加以抹煞的</p>
<p>不過，亞東决不以過去的歷史自限，也决以旣得的成績自滿，如今我們「取村唯有超越時代之嫌，立論決無倒轉歷史之弊」的一貫方針，希望能切切實實地，出幾本關於自然科學，社會科學以及文哲方面的好書。</p>
<h3>中西書局</h3>

<h3>飲料水化消毒法序</h3>
<p>— 程慕願</p>
<p>噫！氯之功用大矣哉！能殺人，亦能利人，其能殺人者，姑置不論，其能利人者，可得而言焉。夫吾人處此大地之上，日用恒常所必需者，水即其一也。苟無水，即無生，曩昔游牧民族必逐水草以居，從可知矣。顧水之爲吾人類之所需要旣若此，對於水質之是吾優良。是吾適宜於吾人，誠有深切注意之必要，不然，其危害於羣衆，豈淺尠哉。證諸事實，如上海市歷次釀成之疫癘，莫不與水有嚴重之關係，每値猖獗之際，死亡枕藉遭遇之慘烈至今思之，猶有餘悸。然自自來水廠普用氯素消毒以來，水之衛生狀况，頓入正軌，遠非使用氯素前所能企及。是以疫癘雖常發生，而其勢已視嚮日大爲戢减，此不得不歸功於氯素。與防漸有方，能抑制水中病菌之滋蔓，有以致之。其裨益吾人類者，僅此一端，已何如耶！關於氯素淸毒水料專書，在外國予嘗見之，我國則尙無撰述發行者，茲煉君可培，不憚辛勞，深思力究，能人之所不能爲者，毅然寫成此書，展閱之餘，覺豐贍確切，適於實用，其中材料，允多新創，故內容與體制之完美，殆罕有其儔，甚佩用心之苦及意義之遠。今行將付梓，徵序於予，爰拉雜作此以應，然予於此重有感焉，國人素不注意水之衛生，竊願讀是書者，能應用於實際，面努力於水之消毒，俾殘暴之病菌，潛消於無形，酷虐之疫癘，得免於猖獗，此不第作奢之所深願，抑亦羣衆之大幸也已。</p>

<h3>發刊辭</h3>
<p>— 鵑</p>
<p>人間世凡是有靈性的人，天賦與一雙亮晶晶的眸子，那决計沒有不愛美的東西的。抬起頭來，見了天半朱霞，不由得要喊起來道：「呀，這是多麼美的霞啊！」見了陸離光怪的雲片，又不由得要喊起來道：呀，這是多麼美的雲啊！」夏雨之後，見了那橫互天際的虹影，更要手舞足蹈的驚呼着道：「咦，快看快看，這彩虹眞好像一條五色的羅帶，是多麼的美啊！」此外夕陽夜月，綠水靑山，也無一不是使人讚美的材料，一到了詩人們美化的筆下，那更要描寫得有聲有色了。</p>
<p>人們因爲天性是愛美的，所以無論男女老幼，莫不知道美的修飾。天然之美，也許有不甚滿足的地方，少不得要假借一些人爲之美；於是聰明的科學家，發明了種種的化妝品，以應他們的需要。</p>
<p>女子們的愛好天然，自古已然，於今爲烈，這是不可吾認的事實。雖然古人有「冶容誨淫」的警吿，但終不能使女子不愛美；所以化妝品的月異日新，有加無已，也是當然的了。憂時之士，以爲女子處於這大時代中，應與男子們共同擔荷救國的重任，不該再在美的修飾上用功夫；然而愛美是伊們的天性，無法糾正，在可能範圍之中，也不妨讓伊們修飾一下，只不要窮奢極欲就是了。</p>
<p>我們出這美容專刋，並不是提倡奢侈，想借此來啟示女子們，大家以美容爲第一步，進而注意於「精神之美」。怎麼呌做「精神之美」呢？便是人格的保持，道德的修養，須於愛好天然之外，做到「潔身自好」的一步。</p>
<h3>女性美的　「九四」標準</h3>
<p>— KS</p>
<p>女性的美，是很難求其十全的。縱使藉着美容與化妝的力量可以補救一部分，然而，這祗是一部分而已，欲求一個『美的典型』，似乎是古今中外，歷幾十世紀而尙未發現。</p>
<p>『美的典型』的構合，是包含許多要素的，那要素便是：</p>
<p>A、先天的。</p>
<p>B、後天的。</p>
<p>C、營養的。</p>
<p>D、運動的。</p>
<p>E、敎育的。</p>
<p>F、修飾的。</p>
<p>G、化妝的。</p>
<p>H、其他——</p>
<p>今之女性們，美的條件，都是屬於某一要素的，她們限於環境，或限於敎育，不能平均地使美的條件完全健全起來。這是事實，儘管召集大量的女性來選擇，其結果仍然是顧此失彼，或顧彼失此的。</p>
<p>然而典型的女性之美，她的外觀，應該是怎樣的呢。終於被具有科學興趣的阿拉伯的詩人提出答案來，答案上開列的是九四標準。</p>
<p>這裏再寫出九個什麼四的內容：</p>
<p>A、四黑：（一）頭髮，（二）睫毛，（三）眉毛，（四）瞳子。</p>
<p>B、四白：（一）皮膚，（二）眼白，（三）牙齒，（四）腿。</p>
<p>C、四紅：（一）舌頭，（二）嘴唇，（三）齒齦，（四）兩頰。</p>
<p>D、四圓：（一）頭，（二）頸，（三）手臂，（四）足踝。</p>
<p>E、四長；（一）背，（二）指，（三）臂，（四）腿。</p>
<p>F、四寬：（一）額，（二）眼，（三）肩，（四）臀。</p>
<p>G、四窄：（一）眉毛，（二）鼻，（三）唇，（四）腰。</p>
<p>H、四小：（一）耳，（二）口，（三）手，（四）脚。</p>
<p>I、四豐滿：（一）頰，（二）腿，（三）臀，（四）乳。</p>
<p>不過，阿拉伯的詩人定下了這樣的九四標準，祗是一種大體上的理想中的美點：所以，如果以合乎這種九四標準的『模特兒』是現在一個畫家的面前，當然是使畫家感覺不够的，因爲還有許多更神秘的美的條件，是被阿拉伯的詩人遺忘了。</p>
<p>根本的美容術</p>
<h3>美容與飲食衛生</h3>
<p>— 頴工</p>
<p>欲求面容美嫩，應在飲食一爲這一點是根本的方法，根本衛生和環境上注意，因一上不發生問題，再加以科學方法，面容自然美嫩。例如：飲食不可過鹹，食前飲開水一杯，食後略進水菓。不多動肝火淫慾，不多勞精神，居處掃酒淸潔，這樣，對於根本方法，可以說已完全做到。</p>
<p>不過話雖如此，但事實上極難做到，因普通一般人對於淫慾，多勞精神二點，更難做到。所以年紀未老，而額上的皺紋，已條條像鷄皮一樣，若不設法治療，便足以爲美觀障礙，治療的方法，可於每夜用磨擦膏擦入皺紋內，然後再用指頭橫擦，直至皮色發紅而止。不過在擦的時候，宜輕而不宜重，軍則必受傷。至於皺紋在口畔，眼梢的，亦當用此法治之，不過縱紋須橫擦，橫紋須縱擦。不論何處皺紋，治法都租同。惟在撫摩之前，須先行顏面熱蒸法，方法可先用開水一盆，放入硼酸末一小匙，放在火爐上，以折疊整齊的毛巾浸濕，再按於顏面，逐次更換，使肌膚發熱，的經十分鐘之久，皮膚旣經淸潔，毛孔亦逐漸舒展，而後再用摩擦膏，即能浸入毛孔，使皮膚柔軟，縐紋亦即容易平矣！</p>
<p>此外皮膚更可使之終年潔白，方法即使日光風寒，不直接接觸於面部。所以在冬天時候，欲保護膚色，當在出外時，應略塗面膏爲首要，如近時通行之雪花膏，即係面膏之一，惟品質須選擇優良者爲佳，此外又忌出汗，因汗中多合鹽分，若再經接觸日光，易使皮膚發黑色。若自遠道或烈日中回來，應用檸檬汁細擦，然後再用淸水洗淸，亦可退去一切黑色。</p>
<h3>美容須勤浴</h3>
<p>— 新華</p>
<p>人的容貌，除了天生尤物之外，不免有多有缺點，要修正這種缺點，應當硏究美容方法，</p>
<p>美容法，不外乎用一種紅黃黑白等色彩，在面部施行特殊技巧，使錢條明顯，陰影模糊，改易人的視綫，變爲美觀，還有用藥物手術來改變本來面目的，這是一種治療，並非美容法了，不過，無論用色彩或用藥物，都不是根本的美容法。</p>
<p>根本的美容法，簡便而易行，就是勤於洗浴。這個方法，本來是很普通的，自經美國鼎鼎大名的美容師華克脫氏提倡鼓吹以後，誰都承認這方法具有最大的效果。</p>
<p>的確，溫水洗浴的生理作用；對於皮膚有重大的意義。吾人當知皮膚裏有無數血管，像細網般的分佈着，我們全身的血液總量，大的有一半藏在皮膚裏，洗浴以後，皮膚受溫熱的刺激，皮膚裏的血管，勢必擴張，這樣，足以增高皮膚活動的機能，增强皮膚的抵抗力與內分泌，因此皮膚的氣孔，不會閉塞，皮膚面的汗垢與脂肪，容易除去，如能天天洗浴，那末面容豈有不美之理。</p>
<p>我國婦女，但知濫施脂粉，不解洗浴能美容的常識，每使全身皮膚，蒙蔽積垢，實爲極大錯誤。要知皮膚不受刺激，血管斷不會擴張，同時腦的血管，也要收縮，頭部血液循環一滯鈍，老廢的東西，積留不動，就是雀斑叢生，臉反衰老，雖善化妝，亦難爲力了。如能勤於洗浴，一月之內，就能發揮自然之美。這種根本美容法，不但節省脂粉消耗，而且達到身體健康，亦何樂而不爲呢。</p>

<h3>怎樣　使臉兒紅潤</h3>
<p>— 駿</p>
<p>愛美本來是人類的天性，尤其是婦女們，她們每日要費去不少的時間在塗脂抹粉上，共實這脂粉能用得適當，果然可以增加美麗，但不得其當，反而醜陋。</p>
<p>面貌的美麗與吾，常以紅潤爲上，至於什麼鵝蛋臉呀，瓜子臉呀，盆臉呀，我以爲是沒有甚麼關係的，只要你能把頭髮的式樣梳得適當，衣服的裁製和顏色配得勻稱，未嘗不令人愛慕。</p>
<p>不過話又要說回來了，我們靠人工去美容還是有效力的，普通的美容術不外乎先以水粉或雪花膏打底，外撲香粉，然後塗胭脂，再撲香粉，加口紅，這樣可說是一個粉裝的美人兒了，却還沒有玉琢，還沒有紅裹泛白，白裏透紅的動人美麗，</p>
<p>你要你的臉兒白嫩紅潤，可用下述的方法；</p>
<p>（一）每晨醒來，用雙手擦面部五六十下。</p>
<p>（二）洗臉後面部塗以人乳，五分鐘後洗去。</p>
<p>（三）每晚塗以鷄子靑（即鷄蛋白），十五分鐘後洗去。</p>
<p>（四）臨睡時擦面部五六十下，再塗以純蜜水和上等宮粉。</p>
<p>（五）所用面粉須上等和不含鉛　的香粉。</p>
<p>若依照上述的方法，按日不斷的去實行，一年年半載後就能見效。</p>
<h3>肥與瘦</h3>
<p>— 顧春旭</p>
<p>—應注意食物攝養—</p>
<p>誰都知道太瘦或太肥對於美容上都是很大的缺憾，所以要求美容，第一步基本工作便是怎樣設法使自已達到不肥不瘦，合乎健美的標準，據醫學家吿訴我們說，人的肥瘦和日常吃的東西有很大的關係，所以若是自己覺得太肥或太瘦的人，只須在吃東西時峪加注意，便可帮助治肥或療瘦</p>
<p>（一）療瘦法　瘦的人應多吃肥肉，炙肉，（略帶生）猪油鷄油，橄欖州，奶油，白塔，鷄蛋　湯，麵包皮，麵　，糖果，　等食物，關於水菓方面宜多吃含脂肪性的如杏仁，核桃椰子，栗子，棗子，橄欖　，有若干種蔬菜如白菜波榮　羅蔔番茄等不　多吃，抽　切忌。</p>
<p>（二）療肥法　惟一療肥方法便是少吃東西。父其是　列幾種含脂肪性的食物，更須忌食，如肥肉，牛油，和一切肉舖出售的食物魚類中如沙丁魚，疣魚等海水魚也忌食，其他如醬油，含小粉的食品，糕餅巧，克力糖，果汁，啤酒，燒酒，黃酒等也忌食。</p>
<p>療肥和治瘦都並不十分困難，只要能忍耐和肯下决心，每隔一星期秤體重一决，效騐便自見。</p>
<h3>美的三部由</h3>
<p>— 卿</p>
<p>「愛美」是人類的天性尤其是年靑時少女，雖然「女爲悅己者容一這種陳腐的封建思想，早已受着時代淘汰，可是在任何不同的環境裏，每一個女子，似乎都需保持她的女性美吧；現在把時代女性美的三部曲（一）面部（二）手與足（三）身體略述於後：</p>
<p>（一）面部　面部的美容術，比較任何部份來得重要些，所以千萬不要使汚垢油膩之類的東西，浸入毛孔裹去，盥洗的時候，應該用適於毛孔大小的粗細毛巾，揩擦淸楚，再塗上些美容露，或潤膚劑，對於口紅，及胭脂的使用，亦應該特別注意，假使在臉上塗些深紅色彩的胭脂，那非但不覺得美觀，反而　猢猻腎部似的，使人厭惡，所以胭脂要塗得匀，用得淡，其决畫眉不應該太挺直，致露兇相，亦不應該太下垂，則成愁容，最好能塗上一些眼彩油更佳。</p>
<p>（二）手與足　手上往往有不知不覺分泌出的油汗，因此隨時須用細軟毛巾，把它擦去，再塗上些杏仁蜜，或潤膚　。手指的裝飾，應　保持自然美，眞正漂亮大方的女子，是不喜搽指甲油的，「足」的部份美容術，大概與「手」差不多，不過在足趾上，染匕紅紅綠綠的色彩，那是很不雅觀的，因爲這很容易被人認爲是墮落女性的。</p>
<p>（三）身體　身體的肥瘦，與「女性美」很有關係，太肥，太瘦都是要不得的，所以發現身體過肥時，這是爲了飽食終日，缺少運動的緣故，因此健身操是必需的，假使發現身體過瘦的話，那未營養應充足，操勞勿過度，這是使身體轉弱爲强的秘訣；還有時常入浴，亦是保持女性美的耍素，入浴的時候，甘油皂，洗澡鹽，都是不可缺少的，再以海棉，或絲瓜絡，仔細擦洗，最後用美容液輕輕抹上，這樣一定會使全身的飢膚光滑細膩的。</p>
<p>美容與妝</p>
<h3>美的經騐</h3>
<p>— 佳人</p>
<p>中外人士的見解，各不相同，外人以頭髮呈黃色爲美觀，所謂「金髮美人」是也。但我國人則以髮黑爲美觀，因髮黑且有光澤，愈足以襯托皮膚之淸白。但我國人犯黃髮者甚多，若欲其變黑，可於每日用野菜葉數張，泡水洗之，二三决後，即能漸使變黑。</p>
<p>若臉上的毛孔太大，可於每晨洗臉後，可用收縮皮膚的美容水，倒在小棉中周擦面部，使之皮毛孔收緊。美容水的製法可用「鉀明礬」五克，一科隆酒精」八百西西，「橙花水」一百九十五西西。</p>
<p>瘦削面龐的人，敷胭脂於貼近鼻部與顴骨之間。臉龐圓形的人，須敷胭脂於於觀骨上，不可敷近鼻部。</p>
<p>凡額部突出的男女，若欲掩蓋其形，則惟賴於化妝，化妝的時候，他處可均塗以粉，獨額部則可勿塗，如此便覺平貼許多，吾則在粉中稍混以靑色，亦能掩蓋其形，此完全是光學上的原理，確有實效。</p>
<h3>嘴唇的化妝</h3>
<p>— 琳</p>
<p>在社交公開的現在，少女們的向部化妝的確是一件不可忽略的事；尤其是嘴唇上的化妝，更爲　要。因爲面部的一切動作都靠着嘴與眼表示出來。在盛行男　接吻禮。西歐各國，嘴唇父比較更重要了。</p>
<p>一般的女子對於搽口紅似乎很少修養，很少有懂得搽口紅的藝術，只是把搽了滿嘴，像血似的使人望之生厭，所以筆者特寫嘴唇化妝法，供獻讀者參考。面部的脂粉搽畢了之後，先用一塊香蜜在唇部上下磨擦幾次，然後把口紅搽在上唇，上唇搽了之後，就緊閉起雙唇，將上唇的口紅摸印蓋在下唇上面，再用一枝畫筆照着所搽的口紅地位，漸漸地使他抹得均匀，再用一塊富於吸收水份的綢布，覆在唇上，讓他吸收那過於濃紅的顏色，使他成爲紅而不艷，淡而不濃的顏色，就成功了。</p>
<p>每一個人的嘴唇必定有一種寬狹厚薄的不同，上面的口紅搽法是指一般合於標準美的嘴唇。假使你的嘴唇患了厚薄　狹的毛病，那就不得不再施以化妝上的改造手術了。</p>
<p>假使你的嘴唇過厚，就可把口紅搽在嘴唇邊治以內，同時又用一種深色的口紅搽在唇的內部，就不會顯得太厚。</p>
<p>假使你的嘴唇太薄，就可用口紅把唇皮劃長，用淡紅色搽內假使。你的嘴唇太大，就要用暗色口紅搽唇的內部，同時縮短嘴角上的口紅長度，把淡色口紅搽成一個適當大小的嘴唇，就不致會覺得太大了。</p>
<p>有了這幾種方法，其他畸形嘴唇上的化裝，就不難得到一個心領神會的技巧，只要仔細考量着長短和角度，愼重用暗淡等色的唇膏，無論怎樣畸形的嘴唇都可改造成標準美的嘴唇了。</p>
<h3>眼的化妝</h3>
<p>— 新華與</p>
<p>—睫毛之關係—</p>
<p>美目盼兮，」「一笑傾城，」足見美目是美容中最要的條件；「要美容，必先美目，」也是美容中天經地義的格言。茲將美目的化裝術，簡潔地寫在下面。</p>
<p>欲目的美麗，須以睫毛來襯托，襯扦睫毛，須用一種强調的色彩。這種色彩，呌做睫墨，塗抹的當兒，以嬌小的刷帚，輕擦睫墨少許，慢慢地掃上睫毛，上睫毛濃些，下睫毛淡些。不過，施行道種技巧的時候，嘴吧務須張開，吾則眼皮閃閉不停，睫墨塗上眼皮，揩拭費時，太不經濟了。</p>
<p>睫毛畫好以後，在下眼臉的下側，描一纖細的綫條，這綫條是很費工夫的，要使這綫條在眼臉的中央部稍淡，近耳的地方稍濃，而接近鼻樑的兩側，比較中央部還要淡些。描好以後，再用小指把綫條累累擦和，使頰脂的輪廓，和綫條融成一片。如此，便能發揮美目盼兮的艷麗了。</p>
<p>這種化裝的技巧，要專靠自己的手術，設使去請敎　脚美容院，那末就要像某女郎光臉變成麻皮，涉訟法庭，末免自尋麻煩了。</p>
<h3>牙齒與美容</h3>
<p>— 陸德紘</p>
<p>保護牙齒也是美容之，因爲不但能直接增加你面部的美麗，而且由於能間接促進身體健康的緣故，使你面部血色紅潤，皮膚淸潔細緻，有了這兩項基本條件，再加上你容貌端正的一項，那麼你的美客問題，不用怎樣硏究討論，你已是宋玉潘安的冉生，即是西施也比不上你那樣美麗呢。所以這一種事半功倍收効極宏的美容方法，想讀者們都應該注意　嗎。</p>
<p>在未說到怎樣保護牙齒方法之前，先來介紹幾個影星們的牙齒。洛麗泰楊每星期必到牙醫院去一决，她是請求醫師檢騐她有沒有不合牙齒標準的錯度，瑪嬌麗微佛有一私人牙醫師，兩星期檢查一决，她也並不曾患牙病，她是請求牙醫師怎樣維持她潔白的程度。狄安娜竇萍的母親說：常竇萍三歲的時候，我就竭力注意她的牙齒，使她將來長成一付健全而美麗的牙齒，這裹只隨意介紹幾位而已。好萊塢銀壇上的紅星，差不多大都楚至少一個月一决去檢騐他們的牙齒，由此可知，他們對於牙齒的重視，是不言而喻了，當我們在銀幕上看見她們啟口而笑，露出了一付白晳整潔的牙齒，我們總覺得不免有點羨慕吧，但是不必羨慕，這裏可以介紹你一種有效護齒的方法。</p>
<p>除了幾條普通的保護牙齒衛生基本條件外，最好能把下列各條都能實行，那末你的牙齒不難達到水準的標度。</p>
<p>（一）日常應注意者：</p>
<p>一，起身及每食後必漱口刷牙，刷時務必以上下爲要則，不可左右亂刷，使殘餘垢殘不能完全拭去，因垢質常帶酸性，可破壞牙齒表面磁質，而起各種牙疾。</p>
<p>二，勿食過硬過甜過酸過冷過熱諸刺激性食物，因過硬食物易硬傷牙齒，危險殊甚，過甜過酸食物易起酸性，過冷過熱食物易使牙齒受剌激而伸縮。因而有高低前後刺壞牙神經之病症。</p>
<p>三，勿用各械品質惡劣牙膏，牙粉或各種代用品（如漱口水等）。因惡劣去垢，每含過多酸質，牙膏果易，損齒亦易，故應竭力避用之，最好用菓汁如蘋菓汁等最佳</p>
<p>四，勿用硬毛牙刷，須以柔軟適度爲宜。除刷牙用牙刷之外，再備一小刷（西藥房有售），專刷齒與齒間凹縫及大刷所不能刷到之處。</p>
<p>五，勿食過飽，過飽每易夢中礱牙（俗語云囈牙）；因食過飽，即不易消化，消化不良，乃起上症，而損牙齒。</p>
<p>六，校整牙齒高低前後凹凸的方法，唯有請敎牙醫，因爲他們有特殊精巧儀器，但成年的人，不如年幼的孩子容易校整，所以爲父母者，應隨時注意他子女的牙齒總之牙齒的影響於美觀，不用如上說明已很可明白。記得不久以前，上海風行着鑲金齒和印度式綠寳心齒，現在差不多已完全淘汰，但是仔細體味起來，他們也是以齒來美他們的容呢。</p>
<h3>如何免除皮膚皺裂</h3>
<p>— 菁華</p>
<p>到了冬天，西北風一起，皮膚便會起皺裂狀態。這是什麽緣故呢？原來皮膚的所以能富彈性而柔嫩，是賴皮膚下的脂肪時時在向皮膚供給營養分。皮膚得到這脂肪的供養，自然在表皮上顯示出豐潤而富彈性。一到冬天，經西北風吹括後，皮下的脂肪就不能如溫暖氣候時的旺盛使行它的作用。因了皮卜的脂肪不能完滿使用它的作用，皮膚的新陳代謝作用也受到影響而起阻碍。因此，皮膚一到冬天，便現出皺裂的狀態。</p>
<p>皮膚的富潤而富彈性是遺成美容的必要條件；而皮膚的皺裂足以破壞這美容。要免除皮膚起皺裂，方法很簡便，用不着花多大錢去買很講究的甘油和粉膏一類的化妝品去塗抹。我所要介紹的，是蜂蜜或乳酷。</p>
<p>蜂蜜花幾分錢，就可在中國藥材店買到；乳酷包括牛乳或人乳，但牛乳比較好而易得到，只要將吃餘下來的已够使用道兩種東西能供給皮膚以極良佳的營養，能够使皮膚新陳代謝的作用興旺起來，眞是免除皮膚皺裂最好的化妝品。使用的方法，一星期施行三，四决已够，過多不相宜。塗抹的時間，當以晚上就寢前較爲方便，在塗抹之前，須將顏面洗滌淸潔，然後將稀薄蜂蜜或牛乳液，薄薄地塗敷一層，如此經過好幾次，一定能得到相當的奏效。</p>
<p>此外，而部多運動，也可减少皮膚起皺裂的狀態；但面部如何運動呢？這也是很簡便的，當談笑時，做些面部表情，如歪臉……就是面部運動的方法。</p>

<h3>標準美容術</h3>
<p>— 志同</p>
<p>甚麼是標準美容術呢？我以爲，第一要用國貨。假使用舶來品化裝，雖美也不能算美！其次，是選擇品料，國貨界當中，五洲藥房以其製藥的經騐，附製化裝品數種，一般人都認爲是很精美，下列的化裝程序，可以作爲仕女們美容的參照：</p>
<p>（一）洗面：用「固本香皂」，洗去面上污垢，皮膚立感舒快。</p>
<p>（二）刷牙：洗面後用「五洲一三一牙膏」刷牙，牙齒潔白，口腔爽快。</p>
<p>（三）敷蜜：敷抹少許星球牌「滋肌純蜜」，於手臉各部，激發血行，滋潤皮膚。</p>
<p>（四）塗霜：再於面部塗「一品香雪花霜」，使面色白嫩，光澤滑膩。</p>
<p>（五）整髮：最後用「一三一香髮水」，洒於髮際，用梳梳整，香氣馥郁。</p>
<p>照以上的辦法，不但達到了美容的目的，又盡了愛用國貨的責任，稱爲標準美容術，誰曰不宜。</p>
<h3>從美容說到强身</h3>
<p>— 新生</p>
<p>美容祇是說容貌的方面，强身是指整個的軀身，這似乎不能混爲一談。</p>
<p>但是現在的時代，已經不是祇重面貌不重身體的時代了，在一般人的眼目中，無疑的要能是健而又美的女性和男性，纔能算是典型的女性和男性。</p>
<p>從前小說書中：面如敷粉的賣寳玉，弱不禁風的林黛玉，這些代表男性美女性美的人物，已經變成歷史的陳迹，而成爲落伍者了！</p>
<p>所以健身和美容，實在有相提並論的必要，換句話說：就是要容貌美同時也要注意身體的健全。而且身體强健，自然面容豐潤，美麗可愛。</p>
<p>健身唯一要道，是耍充實體內的營養，要充實體內的營養，就須調服有效的補劑，現代最負盛名的大補劑，是有下列的幾種：</p>
<p>（一）人造自來血，它已風行數十年，始終爲服者信服稱道，它的效能是專補人體內寳貴的血液，故如有人面色蒼白，息貧血虧弱的病症，服自來血一月後，面色就轉紅潤，因貧血各起的各症也漸霍然痊愈。</p>
<p>（二）五洲乳白魚肝油，是用最新的製造機械，經過嚴密檢定，裏面所含的滋補人身的維他命，凖確豐富，達於頂點，飲服肺體擴張，肌肉發達。</p>
<p>（三）地球牌麥精魚肝油，香甜適口，毫無腥味，人人都可以調服，它能補虛療肺，功效非常確實，久已膾炙人口，因爲魚肝油和麥芽膏，都是最富於生活素的品料。</p>
<p>上述的三種補劑，選擇服用，身體强健，精神飽滿，要想健美自能如願以償。</p>
<h3>一三一牙膏之優點</h3>
<p>— 民</p>
<p>五洲一三一牙膏，爲含有袪穢除垢殺菌消毒特別成分配製而成，質料純凈，氣味芬芳，潔齒固爲其使用目的，而口腔消毒亦具主耍功能，實爲保護牙齒及淸潔口腔之衛生必需品也，茲舉其成分與配合上之特點略述如次：</p>
<p>（一）「炭酸鈣」爲一般牙膏主要原料，本品自無例外，唯其選用之炭酸鈣，爲結晶性粉末，能通過一百四十眼篩，且於五百倍顯微鏡下能察共粒狀之透明體。</p>
<p>（二）「鎂乳」係用氧化鎂，經消化後而成極細之膠狀乳劑，輕度歸性適足，中和齒縫內遺留食物渣滓發酵所起之酸性，爲一三一牙膏中潔齒又一主要成分。</p>
<p>（三）「基礎劑」西黃蓍膠，爲極爲溫柔，絕無刺戟，與中華藥典澱粉甘油並用，成稠軟透明之膠樣物，其稠度經年不變，磨擦齒牙，無藉皂質，亦能起滑潤之作用，故一三一牙膏採用此式之基礎劑也</p>
<p>（四）「消毒劑」麝香草酚，水楊酸甲酯，丁香油酚，水楊酸笨酯，茲配以簿荷腦等，而成芳香性殺菌消毒劑，一三一矛膏香料中含有此種藥品，用後含嗽，爲口腔消毒之主要目的，而其氣味芬芳尙其餘事耳。</p>
<p>（五）「成劑特點」一三一牙膏中所用之實質性充塡料，如上述鈣鎂等，藉應擦之功而起之潔齒作用，一如去垢粉之擦磁器，而此等物質選擇偶一不愼，有損牙磁，今採用一百四十眼篩之結晶性炭酸鈣，及膠質狀鎂乳，論其硬度，恒在三與三。五之間，較之牙磁硬度四至四。五相差一度之遙，故絕無損害牙磁之弊，用時磨擦無聲，而能迅速去垢者，唯一三一牙膏足以常之，是共特點中之特點耳。</p>

<h3>皮膚美與牙齒美</h3>
<p>— 愛</p>
<p>現代的仕女，認爲用皂是一件很重要的事，因爲每日早晚，皮膚都要和香皂接觸，如果用了劣等的香皂，皮膚就會受到不良的損害！</p>
<p>「固本香皂」是名貴的香皂，它的質地和香味，都在舶來品之上，盥面洗澡，都很適宜。它可使皮膚起一種新陳代謝的作用，毫無刺激之弊，所以可以晚用「固本香皂」，就是給皮膚保險。</p>
<p>再人的牙齒不但司咀嚼的作用，並且它在容貌上也佔着很重要的位置，談話喜笑，牙齒都要顯露出來的，所以我們對於牙齒，也要和共他的部分一深的注意美化。</p>

<h3>固本香皂製造程序談</h3>
<p>— 記者</p>
<p>五洲固本皂出品的「固本洗衣皂」，是風行全國遠近聞名的，叉出品的「固本香皂」，質料精良，香氣淸幽，是大衆化的國產香皂。現在把它製造的程序談述如下：「固木香皂一所用的油類，和「固本家用皂」所用的油類稍有不同，大抵是以牛油，椰子油，芘蔴油爲主，製法也和製造洗衣皂相同，是先將油脂混合而碱化之，使成石灰肥皂，惟另用一鍋爐燒煮，等到肥皂旣成之後，就注入軋皂冷却機，使凝結成塊，然後切成長條形，分條擱置玻璃眞空房漂白之，經過幾個月的長久，俟其淨白，臨用時移人盤旋裝置之乾燥室，室之上部有　片機，取淨白的長條皂放進　片機裹面，鐔成鱗片，再由盤旋裝置，撒布在室內數層的銅絲網上烘　之，的一二小時，移入一定量的肥皂攪拌機，和入香料和顏料，啟輪攪作之，的一小時，移進硏磨機，照　樣反復數回，等到香料顏料非常混和以後，乃移入盤旋推出機，它的內部像是一個螺旋的軸，肥皂山螺旋捲出，其出品可以更換各式模型，則欲製圓形方形等都可以從推出機推出之，長條用分隔器切成小塊，然後移入打印車打印，放在淺水木格子裹面移入另一眞空乾燥室內，乾燥後，的一星期的長久，乃送到包裝室包裝成箱，就可以發售了。</p>
<p>五洲固本家用皂能够品質優良，受人歡迎，乃是因爲採用格來別次氏間接方法製造，而非他廠僅用油與苛性碱混合而成之直接法可比；「固本香皂」的製造程序也是用一樣超特的方法，母怪它的出品是不同凡響了。</p>

<h3>美容風波</h3>
<p>— 巧明</p>
<p>牆角許多落葉，自枯綠漸褪成焦黃，潑在地上的水，片時就結成冰，這是象徵着嚴冬在伸張着它的權力。</p>
<p>這是陳先生的家裏，忽然發生了一個小小的風波，原因是—陳先生買回來一瓶護膚品，他很得意的交到他夫人的手裏。</p>
<p>「買回來了嗎，多少錢一瓶」？賢明的陳夫人問。</p>
<p>「一塊二角錢一瓶」。陳先生答。</p>
<p>「小小的一瓶東西，就要一元二角的代價嗎。太貴了！太貴了！」</p>
<p>「是老牌的外國貨呢？質料非常好。」</p>
<p>「你是洋貨崇拜者嗎？」陳夫人立刻把臉沉下來，她嚴厲的說：「現在的時代，誰都知道提倡國貨，而你却是要做洋貨的推銷員。你知道洋貨是好的，但你知道國貨年來進步是很速嗎？况且洋貨搽在臉上，就是美也算是醜。你能舍本求末，我却不能出醜！」</p>
<p>陳先生被陳夫人說得啞口無言了。</p>
<p>過了幾天，陳夫人到五洲藥房去買了一磅裝的大罐美容霜回來。</p>
<p>「你看！這是國貨，只費七角五分的代價，就可以供我們全家人一冬的用呢。」陳夫人得意的說着。</p>
<p>陳先生沒有言語，這塲風波他顯然是失敗了！</p>

<h3>香髮的一幕</h3>
<p>— 屏侯</p>
<p>愛好是人們的天性，何况一般靑春的少女們，她們當然更是愛好中之愛好</p>
<p>小　也是愛好的少女中的一個，她把她的性情培養得那樣活潑，她把她的體驅鍛煉得那樣美健，她把她的姿容修整得那樣秀麗！她是一朶鮮花，一朶純潔可愛的鮮花。</p>
<p>一天，曼娜—小蕾的朋友—走進小蕾的臥室，小蕾剛剛預備出門了，他手裏正拿着一瓶香髮水向頭上洒。</p>
<p>「蕾妹」！</p>
<p>「是曼姊嗎?你從那裏來的？」</p>
<p>「我剛才去參觀了國貨市塲回來的，你眞香呀！」曼娜握着小蕾的手笑着說。「是的，是很香的，這是我前天從百貨商店買來的一瓶上等香髮水。」小蕾說時把她手裏拿的一瓶「紅衣人香髮水」拿給曼娜看。</p>
<p>「這香髮水眞是上等的嗎？但洒在頭上却不見得是榮耀的香呢！因爲已經做了一個不愛國的人了」。</p>
<p>「我也知道用洋貨是要使利權外溢的。不過香髮這一種東西，好像衹有洋貨才好，……」</p>
<p>「蕾妹：你錯了！你知道近年以來國貨的進步也很快嗎，就是香髮水一種化裝品，在國貨中也儘有好的，不過你沒有去找罷了，你爲什麼總要迷信洋貨呢？……」</p>
<p>曼娜這樣正色的說著，小蕾受了大大的感動了，她把她手裏的瓶子很重的摔在地上，表示她從今以後再不迷信洋貨。</p>
<p>幾天後，小蕾是很新興的找到了一種使她滿意的國貨香髮水了，她找到的這一種，源來就是五洲大藥房精製出品「一三一香髮水」。</p>

<h3>美容新訣</h3>
<p>— 治熙</p>
<p>肌膚變嫩　每天在未修飾以前，先用紙浸冷水，不可過濕，輕輕絞過，搽在面部，使肌膚遇冷收縮，再塗上胡瓜的汁或絲瓜的汁，（植物性的化裝水製法，用鮮胡瓜或絲瓜切碎，裹在綢布內絞出，等到澄淸，滴在手心（裏擦面），這樣，不但皮膚不會粗糙，而且皮膚也能變爲細嫩柔滑的。</p>
<p>油臉紅潤大凡臉帶油光的人，因爲面部脂肪的分泌過多所致，每日可用無脂肪質的化裝水摩擦使肌膚漸漸伸張，皮膚的組織得到柔軟的刺激，那油光就會退去，其法，先用毛巾浸熱水潤面，再蘋菓露加蜂蜜數滴，滴在掌心搭擦，等其乾燥，再用白礬石（藥房均有）浸水，輕輕在面部摩擦一决，那皮膚就會紅潤了。</p>
<p>多汗性臉　多汗性的臉，先用蘋菓酸洗滌，再用明　二分，天花粉一分，滑石五分，每早用水調和，搽擦一次，自然會收汗的。</p>
<p>消滅皺紋年輕婦女的皮膚組織，都是結實堅密的，假使面上發現皺紋，先用冷水洗面，刺激皮膚，再用粗布摩擦，到了面部紅熱爲止，或用牛奶和蜂蜜摩擦，也同樣的能够消滅皺紋的。</p>
<p>顏容紫黑顏色紫黑，因血液循環不暢，要發生顏面紫黑的現象，可常服亞砒霜丸，會使變白且嫩，但服亞砒霜丸前後，不可飲茶，切宜注意。</p>
<p>嘴唇粗糙嘴唇粗糙，最不雅觀，若用滑石一分，雷沙爾丁二分，阿刺比亞戈姆五分，蒸溜五分配合起來，每决洗臉後搽一决，嘴唇就會細而紅潤了。</p>
<p>以上所述各法，全是由實騐得來的，時代夫人小姐們，不妨一試，一定可以收得效果的。</p>
<p>化妝漫談</p>
<p>— 頌光</p>
<p>現代一般婦女們對於化妝的認識；僅僅乎知道些撲粉，或則胭脂，至多再加上一項口紅；另有別的女子以爲化妝是須戲劇化俳優式的濃妝豔抹起來，這二種都是謬誤的見解。</p>
<p>當婦女們在化妝部的時候，大概都係受了化妝品的裝潢璜和香味觸鼻的引誘，忘記了去鑒別面粉胭脂唇膏等得品質，同時也忘記了去考慮牠的色彩是否適合本人容顏膏色，因為陋劣的品質，敷在面部常有不良現象。——粉中缺少吸水性，遇汗液時面粉會變成糊狀的薄層。含有澱粉質的面粉，經汗濕使會膨脹起來，面部呈花斑狀，又有不能附牢面膚，易於脫落。故不時要重復撲粉，重復之後，粉層堆積又不勻，所以用這種劣粉非但得不到化妝的效果，反而使面部不美，粉色不合自已的膚色，也是毀損了面部的自然美。</p>
<p>諸位太太小姐們！你們旣知女子應用面粉，胭脂，等來化妝，但是化妝的意義是什麼呢？狹義的說。化妝是一種技術的，藝術的致美方法。廣義的說。化妝是迎合本人膚色的條件，運用化妝品之色彩的調和，以增加天然之美麗。</p>
<p>我們旣認識了化妝的意義，當然耍着手化妝——且讓我一步步地看下去吧：</p>
<p>撲粉的步驟，應先從面頰的下部起，漸及面部的中心，最後撲到鼻部，其中最當注意的爲鼻頰二部之間，要是撲得不牢，很容易露出原本的膚色來。但撲粉太厚，叉犯了太顯明的毛病。所以鼻頰二部之間的粉，應較其他部份濃些；决宜注意的爲面部的大小關係，面型過大的人，面輪廊應以深色的粉敷上。面孔太窄的人，鼻眼相接處應以淡色的粉敷上。</p>
<p>敷粉的手續完畢，應加以整理一下。用粉刷把各處不宜多厚的粉輕輕地刷去，這樣看去就勻稱柔潤，更顯得美麗了。</p>
<p>塗胭脂時最忌的爲「擦」。因爲把胭脂擦上去之後，似乎太呆板了。所以塗胭脂時應慢慢地拍上，由深而展至淡，形似弧形，看去似天然之點綴。</p>
<p>拍的决序，應先從臉頰的上尖起，順着頰骨的曲綫而移，漸向近鼻頰的眼，近觀骨的地方，也應拍上一些，使顯明的邊痕消失。這樣看上去，眞好似天生的紅暈一般可愛。</p>
<p>「唇爲言語的窗戶」。所以唇是慈祥的，溫柔的，熱情的，又是榮憶無限的甜蜜的，常含有强烈的情感衝動的特徵，更是怪有味兒會引人遐思及神秘的誘惑力。</p>
<p>點唇時應先用柔軟毛巾把嘴唇揩乾，因爲唇膏在乾的唇上才會有黏貼力；才後依向唇形的輪廓點上，接着第二步，嘴唇閉緊，把上唇已點的唇膏印在下唇，再用唇膏上下點抹一下，如此不是上下對稱了嗎？</p>
<p>點唇膏的工作完畢，應顧全到嘿角或嘴唇邊的地方，使之消失綫痕，同時用食指把上下唇膏句稱一下，最後再把嘴唇濕潤，那末才演着鮮明而奪目的光澤。</p>
<p>要使眼睛弄得好看一點的話，那就不得不把眉毛修飾一下。眉毛應不長不短，不宜用美眼機來把牠捲去，吾則不特不能討好，反而弄得麻煩了；但即使捲去了，那倒不能不把牠修飾了。</p>
<p>至於畫眉時，應先用眼影膏輕輕地塗在上眼皮，從眼睫到眉毛間，使牠有一層脆嫩的光潤演着，畫眉時眉筆必須趁了天然曲綫移走，眉到畫稍時些微的，應加以延長，那眞是使人無限的愛慕了。</p>
<p>假使還歡喜畫眼圈的話，那可沿着眼睫輕輕地擦上一點較深的眼黛，畫時須四週淡化出來，要自然，不要太生硬，像中國電影明星談瑛女士那樣的一對漫畫式的黑圈子。</p>

<h3>美容奇術</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>你曾看見過有的女人，面孔下垂嗎？她們的嘴巴傾側在邊角，她們的面頰柔曲，她們的眼睛疲倦，事實上，她們的面孔表露出了一種完全疲勞德樣子，甚至年靑的，面上的肌肉會很瘦而很是懦弱。有時這種瘦弱，限於一處，像嘴巴或下眼臉等處。美容的醫師，會用外科的方法，使面部皮膏更緊，而校正美容上的怪態。他們呌做「面孔抬起」，但不幸得很，醫治的結果，不一定有效，結果把好多女人嚇走了。我們不能責備膽怯的婦人，恐怕爲了要矯正很小的缺點而去冒危險。在好萊塢，最近發明了一種新的方法，使疲倦和下垂的面孔，能得高起來—這方法旣然沒有害處，而且來得容易，是一種新的美容奇術。</p>
<p>嘴巴下垂譬如一種普通的嘴巴下垂，可使外貌固執而帶有怒容。你祇要想到一種怒容，需牽動肌肉，三倍於大笑一决，便會知道有怒容的女人，爲什麼表現出疲倦。嘴的角上，很深的凹痕，是一種推下去的表示。許多女人用面粉來制止，缺點就因此發生，凹進的部分，每是缺少了粉。結果形成了黝黑和看不大見窩窟，留在嘴角的旁邊。另外有一件事情，尤其是婦女在忽急之中，時常會發生，便是把口紅塗在凹痕之中，這樣看起來是多麽不整潔和沉鬱啊！</p>
<p>嘴巴做高　然而讓我們注意到醫治的方法，什麼是矯正嘴巴下垂最適切的方法。第一，當這種女人敷粉的時候，嘴巴要張開，嘴角就拉緊了，這樣就是用面粉，那些凹進的地方也可敷粉。然後冉用口紅，下唇的角上，要塗得長些，超過上唇的角上。這種理由，是很明顯的。爲了所以下垂，是爲上唇的嘴角超過下唇的嘴角的長度。因此，我們如果减短上唇的長度，便可消除嘴巴的掛出。然而當你用口紅之時，要把過多的面粉揩去。這是很重要的，把所有向下推的條綫，在嘴巴周圍的，都要塗粉，然後用粉刷刷去。可用手指使這些條錢仲展，這樣面粉就可撲下去。而使人看不出來。塗口紅的時候，應常用得極少，避免在嘴的部分使人可以顯著的看得出來。</p>
<p>面部肌肉　面頰柔曲的，不幸得很，成了一個困難的問題。不容易單獨使其高起來。這完全是爲了肌肉的瘦弱。比較厲害的，竟無法矯正。普通的方法，是調和肌肉和皮膚。譬如用冰去磨擦，可使肌肉堅强。時常用冷手巾，也是一個好方法。這種手續，應當完成於塗抹上等潤膚膏以前的五分鐘。用潤膚膏的時候，面孔的肌肉不必去拉動。潤膚膏應當要輕輕的拍進皮膚。任何面部的推動，不拘向上或向下，可使肌肉伸展和减弱。面孔向上牽拉之後，這種方法是不會再有效果了。然而時常用潤澤皮膚的膏劑，也可使面部的肌肉加强起來。用好的潤膚膏，更可掩蔽面部肌肉柔曲的缺點。假如潤膚膏和胭脂，採取藝術的方法來應用，甚至可把缺陷完全除去。因爲胭脂，好像</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>一種遮蔽物，可以很巧妙的征服全個面頰。綿軟和聰明相混合起來，可以創造你所欲望的幻像眼睛做高　現在，我們</p>
<p>要說到所謂「靈魂的門窗」。疲倦的，憂鬱的眼睛，通常是爲了下眼殮好像有蟲在爬動而成功的。眼睛下的黑眼圈，每是同時發現。假如多睡幾小時，是不會使這種眼圈去掉，但會退淡一些。眼睛四周的肌肉，也耍時常用潤膚的膏劑，使得眼睛張得高些。這裏有一個很滑稽的方法，可以用眉毛鉛筆，沿眼臉的四周，描一條淡的外綫。這根綫然後冉慢慢的仲展，越過眼睛的外角，略爲向上一些。眉毛也是如此，向上一些。條綫細小和眼睛四周的縐紋，也可表現出疲倦的樣子，這通常可於敷面粉時使其展長，而隱蔽去，結果被粉面脫去。面粉的刷子，可以刷去任何地方塗得過多的粉屑。</p>
<h3>莉莉</h3>
<p>— 麗君</p>
<p>是大淸早，太陽剛閃到克羅咪銀白床桿時，S敎會學校的皇后莉莉姑娘早已起身了。她正披了件粉紅色的晨衣站在梳妝檯前，背後拖着那條修長而富有曲綫的背影。</p>
<p>洗過臉，她並不立刻美容，只對放在面前的一大堆大小不同的瓶子發出一個淺笑，那笑使她自己在鏡子的反射裹看到了也感到太美。眞的，她是太美了，只講二瓣嘴唇就比小孫送的西洋胭脂膏還紅，無怪男同學們耍舉她做皇后。在這年節裏，她就收到了這許多禮物，什麼去國香水呀！好萊塢雪花粉呀！紅紅綠綠就是這們一大堆，到呌她不知用了那樣好呢？</p>
<p>大哥是嫂嫂的「脂粉買辦」，昨兒替她估估這些禮物的價格，據說香水每瓶至少在二十元以上，雪花膏也都是五六元以上的西洋來路貨。不過當大哥找起林送的那瓶子時，却向桌上一拋說：「什麼東西，幾只角子買的中國貨也配送人。」這使莉莉紅了好一會子臉，何况嫂嫂又有意找起瓶子笑着。</p>
<p>不過莉莉却記着林附來的那張紙條，上面寫道：「不耍小看這不値錢的東四，牠是國貨，牠代表了一個眞誠的心之獻。」</p>
<p>憑良心說：莉莉常常感到林可愛的，他總覺得林比別人好。她聽了大哥對林送的東西的奚落，不禁提出抗議道：</p>
<p>「我們要美容，耍保護皮膚，難道一定要用外國貨麼？外國貨又沒比中國貨好，不過外匯貴，外國貨也就貴些罷了，這時候還把錢白白送給洋人，憑什麼心？」</p>
<p>大哥却說：「你有種不用外國貨，不必嘴硬。」</p>
<p>「有種的不用外國貨」！莉莉默唸着大哥昨天的話。她想，中國貨的美容品一樣好，她又何苦做沒有種的人，替國家造漏卮呢？</p>
<p>想釗這裏，她毫無疑慮地揀出林送的那管國貨雪花膏來開始修飾着她嬌嫩光潔的面部，待美容的工作完畢了，他寫了幾張相似的紙條分包在各種化妝品裏，一起呌車夫阿富送出去，那些紙條上大概寫道：「承惠物甚感，不過我不敢再用洋貨，作二重浪費，請轉送他人爲宜。」</p>
<p>嫂嫂看到了她，却拉着她說道：「莉妹，新年裹打扮得格外美麗了，來路香品畢竟勿推扳呀！」</p>
<p>莉莉不回答，肚子裏却藏着個暗笑，她想：「阿林的國貨才不曾比來路貨美容品推扳呀！「</p>
<h3>美容法一束</h3>

<h3>人生之眞美善</h3>
<p>— 醫師丁惠康</p>
<p>申報新年有美容專刋之印行，陸子以銘索言於余。曰善哉！美容者人人之所欲也。但人生之眞美善夥矣，初不獨美容已也；惟人生之眞美善，實與美容有密切之關係，而世人不之注意，爲特表而出之，世之欲達美容之目的，與夫求人生之眞美善者，幸注意焉。</p>
<p>（一）光明之家庭</p>
<p>光明之家庭，非必高廳大厦之謂也，但求光綫充足，空氣暢通，有明窗凈几，可以讀書，庭前有綠圃數弓，可以蒔花種竹，鳥語蝶舞悅我耳目，壁間懸繪事二三，以當臥遊，妻孥笑傲其間，絕無詬喧之聲，家庭之幸福旣具，主人之容光煥發，乃自然之結果，此人生眞美善之一也。</p>
<p>（二）健康之生活</p>
<p>人體如機械，故生活必須有一定之規律。曰工作遵守時刻，不可漫無節制，使身心過於疲勞，此乃健康法之第一步。曰早起早寢，俾身心得有充分之休息。曰適宜之運動，如日光浴深呼克步行藍球誷球游泳等，吾人每日必須抽出少許之時間，用於身體之銀鍊，有健康之生活，則因然之美麗，自然流露，此人生眞美善之二也</p>
<p>（三）自然之享受</p>
<p>吾人旣生存於大自然中，則大自然之享受，實爲吾人天賦之權利，又何可自行放棄。吾人若於每星期，能作旅行一次，登山臨水，選勝尋幽，望雲飛而悟蒼狗之幻，觀魚游而獲濠梁之樂，俗塵盡條，與世暫忘，則不特於吾人之肉體，獲益匪淺，即吾人之心靈，亦得無上之愉快，此乃美容之要素。亦人生眞美善之三也。</p>
<p>（四）超脫之心靈</p>
<p>婆婆世界，無非苦難，何况即忘，心中不有一毫沾滯，每日心中一團太和元氣，自然萬象回春。蘇子瞻曰：人生悲樂，過眼如夢幻，不足追惟，以時自娛爲上策也。白樂天詩云：蝸牛角上爭何事，石火光中寄此身，隨富隨貧且隨喜，不開口笑是痴人。石天基曰：人之心思，一存和悅，其顏色現於外者，自然藹美，胸懷存於內者，何等快樂。故內有超脫之心靈，即外有藹美之容顏，此人生眞美善之四也。</p>
<p>（五）適當之娛樂</p>
<p>藏修息遊，古有明訓。且際茲文明日進之社會，心神過勞，殆爲現代人之通病，允須有適當之娛樂，以爲調劑。此可就各人之所好而行之。如將天地山川之秀美，繪之以丹靑，或納之於攝影，不但自怡心神，抑亦衆目共賞，。或披襟當風，高歌一曲。或雅樂迭奏，婆娑起舞。皆調節生活過分之緊張，亦即使容顏不致受生活過勞之影響，乃人生眞美善之五也。</p>
<p>（六）科學之利用</p>
<p>近世科學進步，欲求人生之眞美善者，亦可利用科學以得之。如摧殘人生者，莫如疾病，今有人焉，因素患咳而容顏憔悴，苟利用科學，如X光之診斷，氣胸之治肺，期所謂預防之方，早治之法，俱可及時得之，此不特關於個人之健康與美容，即於家庭社會間，亦胥蒙其福利。夫造福人羣，本爲科學最高之目的，同時亦爲科學權威之所及，小之爲吾人之欲求美容，大之爲吾人欲求體力之增進，與健康之早復，俱可利用科學，此爲造成人生眞美善之要素也。</p>

<p>假使有人見到過梅畹華或程禦霜的尊容，或是他們最近的便裝照片的話，再往戲院裏去看土一齣他們的化裝表演之後，就要覺得奇怪了，爲什麼他們那樣胖胖的尊容，一上裏，就變得那麼俊俏？所謂中國古型美人臉—爪子臉了，難道他們眞有什麼變「相」術的秘訣嗎？並不，這所以能使他們的胖臉變瘦，就應該歸功「貼片子」了。</p>
<p>這「片子」貼在旦角的頭上，粗看起來，好像是聯在頭髮一起的，其實不然，「片子」乃是單獨的幾張，在旦角化裝初步—擦粉，塗胭脂，打眉毛，打眼窪等等—工作完成後。就把這額上及兩鬢的片子貼上去，然後再進一步的化裝工作，假如你的臉是胖的，可以把兩鬢的片子往後貼一些，這樣一來，在强烈的燈光反射之下，胖的臉變瘦了，而瘦的臉却好像胖了一些了，再如長的臉，也可以把額上片子往下貼一些，短的臉，那末將額上的片子移上一些，除了你是胖得或瘦得不成樣的臉，都可以使她變得比較更漂亮一些的，因爲這「貼片子」是平劇化裝裏的極重要的步驟，所以特地把她很簡略地向各位介紹一下。</p>

<h3>簡易美容術</h3>
<p>— 秋萍</p>
<p>愛美爲人之天性，但求美之術多端，欲求簡單易行，確切有益之方，厥惟容顏之保養，使容顏不易蒼老，卽能永駐靑春；以及口腔之衛生。使牙齒不易脫落，則瓠犀皓潔，宜笑宜嗔。凡此兩端，必須日常注意，自能駐顏有術，美麗動人。茲將容顏應如何保養，牙齒應如何衛生兩點，分述如下，以供愛美仕女之參考</p>
<p>天時之寒暖，以及在風暴雨，烈日霜雪，面部一無保護，經過長時期之攻擊，當然極易變老。蓋就生理上講，皮膚內容細脆，無時無刻，不在新陳代謝之中，假使推陳出新的機能薄弱，陳的推不出去，新的就生不出來，於是乎皮膚的表面層，起了硬化，隨之而生的，便是皺紋，這便是美人老去，鷄皮鶴髮的預兆，我們明白了這一層，治本的辦法；應該及時保養皮膚，第一個條件，便應該選擇富於滋養性的雪花，日常搽敷容顏，一方面用以抵抗風日的侵襲，一方面能吸出毛孔中的分泌，增進生物學上的活動機能，使那新的細胞，活潑健全，那些已經死的細胞，就被他推擠出來；這樣一來，保養容顏的能事已盡了。所以說穿了便狠簡單。可是雪花膏充斥上，究竟何種雪花，滋養成分，最為充足呢？就華者個人的經騐所得，當推人人共知。確能嫩面除斑的無敵牌蝶霜，這是大衆周知的美容珍品。筆者用之旣久，確是合乎理想的美容雪花，用敢為讀者介紹的。</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>「有美一人兮齒燦燦兮，」我們從這一句詩句上，可以看出與美容不可分離的便是牙齒，並且牙齒影響於身體的健康，至大且巨，現在注重健康美，欲謀健康，第一重門戶，須從清潔口腔始，據許多牙醫生的經騐告訴吾，有許多患齒病的人，前來求治，雖然經過合理的治療，給他們治愈，然已痛苦備嘗，即使醫好，然終沒有天然的牙齒來得健全；試一研究其致病之由，十九是並沒有合理的口腔衛生，「水死而後虫生，」牙齒永不潔淨，齒病因之業生，同時齒磁黃膩，使人望而卻步，此實最足妨礙美容，和健康之關鍵。欲矯此弊，惟有即日使用無敵牌著名出品無敵牙膏，因無敵牙膏，即鈣晶牙膏，筆者從前所用慣的是外國貨牙膏，後經友人介紹，試用無敵牙膏之後，便有發生「相見恨晚」的感覺；因為無敵牙膏，另有一種風格，另有一種口味，在漱口時，便感覺到另有一種快感，求諸國貨中！實在無與匹敵，即求之外國貨中，亦無多讓。此為筆者的實騐，用敢刊之報章，謹請愛用外國貨高貴牙膏的人們，不妨一試無敵牙膏，定能證明筆者之感想，實非過譽。同時提倡國貨，把入超逐年減少，亦是吾人應盡之天職。</p>

<h3>談翡翠</h3>
<p>— 妙人兒</p>
<p>上海翡翠公司，為珠玉業巨　陸鈞仁·陳惠泉·吳瑞生·三公所經營，一昨道過靜安寺路，乘便往訪，得晤程馥森君，暢談良久，承告翡翠種種，　就記憶所及，略述於下：</p>
<p>翡翠為玉石之一種，產於吾國雲南與英屬緬甸邊境深山中，以透明而鮮綠者為最貴。質堅實，刀斫不入；火炙不溶；種類甚多，優劣互異，非老於此道者，不能辨別。吾國流傳已久，而盛行於遜清乾隆年間，自後風行相沿，王室貴胃，無此不足以炫耀。洎乎今日，其首飾品得霸世界各國，不可謂非遜清提倡之力也。</p>
<p>翡翠之琢磨，全賴人工，非機械所能及，是以數百年來之技術，仍能稱雄於藝術界而令中外人士讚嘆者，非偶然也。嘗憶去春大新公司舉行玉藝預展會，門票雖高至一元，參觀者仍如潮湧，致場地不能容納，一日聞拉鐵門者凡數次，大新公司且破例於星期日上午照常營業時。陳列品中，有九獅圓爐一，琢磨工細，栩栩如生，吳鐵城氏蒞會參觀，為之咋舌，且云有此藝術，始能挽回國光，其言如是，足證珍貴，良以色澤光彩，非盡師所能描摹，即近代美術帶色攝影，亦難神似，蓋翡翠自有寶光，燦爛奪目，非人力能所逮也。</p>
<p>翡翠之高貴，既如上述，是以　鼎紛起，其市上吾人能常見者，有燒料·煎色·及××國翡翠三種：燒料。則以類似玻璃之原料，混入綠色，燒煉而成，惟中含有細料泡，且光彩絕不若真者而閃閃煥豔也，故真偽極易辨識。煎色·則以翡翠之白色者，（俗稱地張）煎以翠綠色料故名，惟因質料相同，較難　別，然置於火上燻炙，色即褪去矣。至ＸＸ國翡翠，質色均能朦蔽外家，僅其中多黑點，色亦帶黃，驟視之，頗類碧玉，如於燈光中映觀，色澤即大減矣。</p>
<p>業翡翠者，本守墨陳法，閉關自固，年來始謀對外發展，一方更整頓業規，力求革新，遂有與外界接觸之機會，故繼大新公司玉藝預展會之後者，乃於市政府十周紀念展覽會，特　手工藝珠玉業陳列館，琳琅滿目，空前未有。惜以七七盧溝橋事變發生，風聲突緊，未及終會而宣告結束，致未廣及大眾，良深惋歎。</p>
<p>翡翠之參加國外競賽者，計有二次：一為一九二六年巴拿馬運河費城賽會，一為一九三三年美國芝加哥賽會，均獲佳獎美譽，為國增光。</p>
<p>戰事西移，上海以特殊關係，各業畸形發展，該業新張者，可達數十家之多，祗以原料缺乏，以致價格飛漲，而購者仍然紛至沓來，幾有供不應求之勢，誠該業黃金時代也。</p>
<h3>製造化妝品之新動向</h3>
<p>中法大藥房之創製化妝品，遠在　清光緒十六年間，其時國內採用化學方法製煉化妝品者，如鳳毛麟角，物稀為貴，一時製售之立人牌，生髪水，紫羅蘭生髪油，羅威香粉及三美牌花露水等品，風行全國，大獲佳譽，推為化妝品業之祭酒，甚有誤以中法大藥房為專售化妝品者，而外商側目，幾經訟累，出品之信譽亦更著，迨民國十四年，大西路製藥廠成立，對於製造化妝品之器械設備更為完美，絡續行世這著名化妝品，有孩兒面雪花，雙獅牌花露水，白玫瑰生髪油，仙女香粉等，先後達六十餘種，選料謹嚴，煉製精究，較之舶來出品並無遜色，而售價低廉，經濟實用，尤為社會所稱道。惟該藥房猶以為未足，力圖改進，製造化妝品，不僅欲以美容，且求兼顧治病作用。最近出品即本此原則維他命Ｅ，即其著例，對於消除斑痣，果獲著效，今後出品製造，悉依此新動向推進，嶄新貢獻，當不在遠。因假以為預告，其已發行之化妝品，酌舉如後：——</p>
<p>潤面劑類：孩兒面，白玉精，三美牌雪花，藍瓶香雪花等</p>
<p>生髪水類：明星生髪水，立人牌生髪水，天鵝生髪水等八種</p>

<h3>二十五年來化粧品業與雅霜</h3>
<p>— 葉俊</p>
<p>人類有美觀之嗜好，一若飲食之與味。孟子有曰：食色性也，昔深山有一道者，其子生平未嘗近女色，一旦引其入市，見彼姝之麗秀妙美，心竊羡慕，歸而懨然若重病，父知而誑之曰，此人而虎也，能噬人。子曰，寗為所食無怨。他日又入市，過一褸襤無鹽，面不修飾之女，則廢然覺悟，修其父之道而終其業，故美觀雅顏，能令人愛慕，醜姿不妝，可使人厭惡，雖頑童而知之。中國之有化妝品，考之於史，如褒似，妲己，西施，昭君，潘安，宋玉，以及於今，凡稱美貌，莫不具化妝之妙術，化妝之妙術，尤賴於化妝之工具，故鉛白朱紅，麝濃蘭幽，脂膩皂潔（此皂係植物之實），此千年前之化妝品，吾人於讀史之時，字裏行間得之。時至今日，科學昌明，化妝工具，二十五年來，因雅霜之發明，遂開國貨美顏品之新紀錄，既換舶來之漏　，復為今日化妝品業之導河，當時舶來之某某雪花某某霜等，盛極一時，自雅霜出世之後，亦為遜色一　，漸覺相形見拙也。</p>
<p>雅霜者，一化學的配合物也，脫胎於脂肪，而無脂肪之膩，取材於皂　，而無皂　之苛；副以蜜，和以藥，其香味之獨具一功，東亞一隅，不能有同一之物質，知者類能言之·故其效能潔膚白肌，滋潤皮膚之細胞，營養局部之組織，信非虛語，今試以化學公式表明之：</p>
<p>凡一製品，求其在社會上有立足點，自當有獨特之長點，雅霜之長點，不在乎公式配合之佳，尤在選料之嚴，世人皆以為脂肪酸（即士替林）和以　性，即成一糊狀之潤膚劑；不知脂肪酸分類牌號有十餘種之多，最普遍一百二十七度至一百二十九度，又為一百二十九度至一百三十一度，最佳者為一百三十一度至一百三十三度，雅霜用之脂肪酸，其強度常在一百三十三度以上，故價亦倍之。其次為　性物質，　性物質，如炭酸鈉，炭酸鉀，苛性鉀，苛性鈉，錏氣水，與錏之化合物，皆能與脂肪酸發生親和力，而製成雪花膏；然多置則苛刺覺痛，不足則變成油離，此配合上必須輾轉研究，俾得成一完善之美容品，洋蜜之能潤膚，硼酸可以殺菌，在雅霜製品中皆適量利用之；酒精能刺激肌膚，久之使局部組織變老；故雅霜已盡量不用。辨此有一法，雪花膏製劑中，發見有結晶形之彩光者，乃多含酒精之明證。</p>
<p>今雅霜發行適為二十五週紀念，而申報乃以化妝品專刊徴文於陳君，陳君謙遜，囑余為之，余謂雅霜之老友，實為申報，發行之初，申報全幅廣告，予雅霜發展極大之助力。茲者申報復刊未數月，而銷數廣告，兩相並進，將來之希望，當與英倫之泰晤士報東西媲美，則企予望之矣。</p>
<h3>科學化裝術</h3>
<p>— 鏡</p>
<p>在過去許多年數之中，化粧品一項，舶來品充斥全國，售價頗高；但是外國化粧品，無非是適合外國人的皮膚而已，要知道中國人的皮膚，顯而易見，與外國人截然不同。所以儘你用高貴的化粧品來化粧，結果總覺得不大滿意。可是每年的漏　，幾百萬元就因此流出，醫界名宿，孫玉成先生有鑒於此，特地下一番深刻的研究的功夫，運用他醫藥上的經騐和實騐，發明一種一鳴驚人，超出舶來品的化粧品，就是名聞全球的「鏡面霜」。這鏡面霜是用最上等雪花霜的原料作基本，又加上去除雀斑面皰縐紋等特效名藥，合在一起，用科學複製方法，製成雪一般的霜膏，敷在面上，光滑潤膩，白嫩嬌艷，並且因為藥力的作用，能夠使得皮膚細胞，個個活潑，沉着的黑色素，（即雀斑）漸次褪隱，的確可以把面部的缺點，在不知不覺之中，無形消滅。所以發明以來，博得各界十二分的美譽，推為化裝品中無上極品，最近聞得又發明一種「美容鏡面霜」，這是比較普通化裝品，來得質細味香，令人可愛。含有藥劑的名呌「特製鏡面霜」，可以治療上述的種種面部雀斑面皰等症，真是首屈一指的靈藥。凡欲得真正的超等的化裝品者，請三注意焉！</p>
<h3>夜來香</h3>
<p>— 來</p>
<p>先蒙廠專製高等化粧香品，創辦於民國二十年，資本國幣五萬元，完全國人經營，國人技師，原料大都採用法國貨，間有德國及本國，其已出品者有「夜來香香水」「固本霜」「先蒙美髪酸」等。正在計劃出品者，有「夜來香花露香水」「夜來香香粉」唇膏，胭脂等。該廠出品向歸上海華德行獨家經理，向來專銷外埠，每年營業總額達十萬餘元，近年來復向本埠謀發展，其中「夜來香香水」，尤為本埠各界士女所樂用，前途正方興未艾，僅為國貨中之佼佼者。</p>

<h3>影星克萊拉實的美容術</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>在過去十餘年前，克萊拉寳在銀幕上，曾經淘醉過無數的公子與姐兒，她現在雖然已似乎銷聲匿跡了，可是她的美容術，至今還是深印在每個影星們的腦際。</p>
<p>克萊拉寳，她集中了近代女性所有底媚的誘惑力與麻醉性，强烈的發揮着在熾和眞摯的熱情在銀幕上做男子們普通的戀人，因此，她在電影圈裏，便成功了一朶奇艷之花，她的香與熱底魅力，深刻地刺戟在男子甚至於女子們的心坎裏，在那時候，便舉世譽之爲「熱女郞」，以及「近代女性之皇」。</p>
<p>然而她第一决爲電影演員的時候，她的失敗異常凄慘，她雖生於都市，長於都市，喜歡運動，游泳，騎馬，打網球，可是她的生性很是放浪不覊，因此她的年齡，雖還是一個如花的少女，可是她的面部蒼老與寬弛，終於使導演的不得不向她說了幾句含其譏刺性的話，使她竟嚶嚶哭泣起來，珠淚瑩瑩，收入了鏡頭，結果是將她所表演的影片全部剪去。經過了這一個嘗試的失敗，這才使她感到自己委實太忽視了美容與夫少女實貴的丰姿，於是她在每天除了運動以外，大淸早起，便裸向着加里福尼亞的太陽；作半小時以上的日光浴，當臨睡前，她便把用蘋果與蕎麥，在烈性酒裏浸出的汁，在臉部用力的擦抹，這樣，使她的面部日漸豐潤，而且衰老寬弛的皮膚，不久也顯示出柔滑細嫩的光彩來，當她第二决應邀愛爾馬克夫頓所導演的戲，試映的結果，竟異常美滿，自此她在電影圈裏，便一步步向上走，一九二六年主演了美國女作家伊麗娜葛玲所寫的熱」，她的美麗與熱情的名兒，使她幾乎飛上天去。</p>
<p>現在，好萊塢有一大半影星，還是很忠實地使用着克萊拉寳的美容術，以掩飾那快將逝去的靑春，因此，「熱女郞的名詞，似乎已成過去，而熱女郞當時常和一般影迷們所說的：「我底美麗，不是化裝，我的成功，自然也不是導演，而我所感謝的，祗有太陽蘋果與酒。」就差不多成了美容的至理名言。</p>
<h3>美容法四種</h3>
<p>— 陸文表</p>
<p>美麗的容顏常然一半是靠天然，不過人工的修飾也能帮助不少。古代的美人西施王嬸，若能生在今日，用現代美容術化妝一番，那不知她們將更加美麗到如何地步了。作者現將幾項基本的美容法介紹給愛美的女士們：</p>
<p>一，除去汗毛法</p>
<p>美容的第一步工作便是除去面部的汗毛，因爲汗毛對於容貌上有極大的妨礙。普面部，塗畢後，若此時蠟已不大熱，便可用刀片將蠟搽面部，（原的十分之一公分。）然後拿冷手巾一塊，遮在面部帮助蠟凝結，隔了若干時候，便可用很快的手術將凝結的蠟皮撕去，汗毛便跟着一同揭去，並無多大苦楚。</p>
<p>還有一個別的方法，除去汗毛，就是用電術，但是這工作不能在自己家裹作所費也較用蠟的方法貴多了。</p>
<p>通女子都用鉗子將汗毛一一拔去，這方法非常不好，因爲一則費時，二則有傷皮膚，最好的方法是往藥房購買一種專爲除汗毛的蠟，（須購可靠的牌子白蠟亦可。）將蠟放在一隻凈潔的小鍋內，用文火薰使蠟漸漸溶解，溶時應用刀片攪拌，至蠟全部溶解時，便將鍋予離火，讓蠟漸漸冷郤，然後取藥水棉一塊，浸濕蘸雲母粉塗</p>
<p>二，面部光潔法</p>
<p>欲使面部美麗，單恃脂粉是不够的，治本的方法是滋養皮膚，使皮膚光滑細嫩；最科學化滋養皮膚的方法，是取一些山芋粉，放在茶杯內，再加兩湯匙香料水，拌成水槳，然後　臥床上，將山芋粉槳遍塗面部，頸部，塗畢後，靜待半小時至小一時後，再用開水將粉洗去，面部容光便很煥發了，若是覺得自己的皮膚非常乾燥，缺乏脂肪，那麼應用蛋白代替山芋粉，塗面部，方法完全一樣，效果也很好，美國好萊塢的影星們都愛用這種美容法。</p>
<p>三，搽粉法</p>
<p>在未撲粉前，得先搽面霜，然後再搽面粉，面粉的種類顏色很多，須擇好的用，吾則有傷皮膚，晚上臨睡時，須將脂粉完全洗凈，最好用藥水棉蘸水細擦面部，因爲塗了脂粉睡眠，猶如穿了鞋襪外衣睡覺一樣，當然是不舒服的。</p>
<p>四，點唇法</p>
<p>嘴唇的美麗和容貌有極大的關係，所以點唇並不是單將類色塗到嘴唇上去便寫料事，必須先行研究自己的嘴唇，生得如何而定點法，譬如唇角向下沉的，應將顏色塗上些，切不可將顏色塗到唇角上去，嘴唇生得較大的，只須在兩唇間加一點顏色便够，點唇用的顏色極多，有深紅色，有淺紅色，珊瑚色等，深紅色看去像血，只宜天生本很美的嘴唇纔能用，普通人還是用淺紅色珊瑚色較妥，逢到若是參加晚上宴會時，因燈光緣故，嘴唇所塗顏色便覺不顯明，在顏色上另敷一層印度樹膠，便覺鮮艷光彩了。</p>
<p>五，美眼法</p>
<p>眼的美是在眼珠靈活有神，要達到這目的，只須在每日淸晨起身後在較空廣的地方將眼珠往上下四方旋轉動，同時以兩食指輕擊兩額，使活血，如此練習數分鐘，對於眼部美麗有極大的帮助。</p>
<h3>關於香水</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>許多女孩子在聖誕節或新年的時候，準會從男朋友或丈夫那裏得到一二瓶香水吧！但你們知道這種製造香水的實業，去年單在美國一地，其貿易總額超過了美金二萬萬元嗎？美國五萬家美容院共賺了一萬萬餘錢！在世界聞名的法國香水業中心，格勒薩每年要供給七千五百噸鮮花。</p>
<p>一個本已嬌豔的女子，再洒上幾滴香水精，當然伊將更顯得可愛了。下面讓吾來談談關於香水的一切。</p>
<p>十二年前，一羣科學家在埃及尼羅河流域的多坦哈門王古墳里，發見了無數美麗的，彫花的方解石瓶；瓶蓋一經揭開，頓時有一種希奇的香味由瓶中冲出。埃及原是一個不可思讓的國度，賜給吾們今日以香水的正是她。</p>
<p>人類的歷史上雖沒有關於香水及化妝品的記載，但吾們確信，它們的故事也與人類的一樣、是古老的。從中國，埃及，巴比倫，希臘，羅馬等等國家的最老的文化上看來，製造香水還是一種精緻的藝術呢</p>
<p>耶穌降生前五十年，在埃及地方有一個名呌克麗芙柏德拉的女皇，關於她一生香水與化妝的材料、實在是書不勝書據傳她在招待安東尼的一决宴會裏，　曾在宮中的地板上，鋪起兩尺厚的玫瑰花毯來。她死後的輓歌寫道：一讓你的鼻孔裏永遠有着芳香，啊！尊貴的女皇！讓你的喉嚨間水遠有着蓮花。」</p>
<p>從前，中國女人都用『刨花水』來刷亮她們的頭髮，傳聞她們的『蓮花鞋』裹也放上什麼香粉的。遠在幾世紀前，中國婦女的手指上，已有花彩畫起了。</p>
<p>古羅馬帝國在舉行宴會的時候，也在酒中加入香料。伊利薩伯女皇更設有一間專門的房間來製造伊個人用的香水哩！</p>
<p>但自古及今，反對這項化妝品的人也不知有多少。在佛勞倫斯全盛的時期，有一個名呌薩伏那拉的僧人有一决對許多婦女說道：『佛勞倫斯的姊妹呀—罪惡，懶惰，虛渺—吾要呌你們把東方的香料統統毀了。』</p>
<p>當時，有一個婦女立刻站了起來，跑往街中；其餘的也跟着跑，接着街中心滿堆了香粉，香水及其他化妝品之類的東西。別城市的人亦感染着了這種瘋在，一把火將大宗美容的物品都燒了起來；說也奇怪，這决火燒經過了好幾天才熄滅。</p>
<p>後來情形愛了，道個僧人終因暢談無忌的言論被燒死了</p>
<p>維多利亞女皇時代，也有人反對搽施香粉與唇膏。後至十字軍遠征的時候，許多貴族及武士叉將無數珍奇的香水自東方帶至歐洲；而就此奠定了此後東西方貿易的基礎，更影響了文藝復興及一四九二年哥倫布的發現新大陸。</p>
<p>法國亨利二世時的凱塞琳女皇也是一個酷愛香水的女人。她有一個專門替伊製造香水的人名呌處納。</p>
<p>處納能將香水製成一種毒液，使穿上一變洒有這種毒液的手套的人，就會默默地死去—這個秘方郤沒有傳了下來。</p>
<p>這位女皇更將巴黎的一切泉水都捲入了香料。法國香水業的中心格勒薩，據說也是她創建的。</p>
<p>在那裏，你將看到無數的玫瑰花，紫蘿蘭及橘樹種植着。格勒薩每年要供給世界以七千五百噸鮮花，來製造婦女們噴洒的香水！</p>
<p>從花里提出的香料還需與別種香料化合起來，好的與惡的味過產生了番水的芬芳與馥郁。一種流行的香水據說是混合了十七種不同的香氣的。共中允以麝香爲最名貴。最後，香水更需用酒精攙淡，旣濃了，就要觸鼻；假使太淡了，其香味又不能持久。</p>
<p>在從前，吾們只有二百種香料，到了現在；則至少已有了一千種了。其中有許多是以各種成分配合而成的。</p>
<p>香水在現代已不是一種奢侈品。製造皮革，殺蟲藥粉，漆布，油漆，各種織物，墨水，與藥品的時候，都要依靠它來除去那種令人厭惡的味道的。現在更有些科學家製造了一種香水汽油，用來打在空氣中，以除去其內的混濁哩！</p>
<p>由此，吾們當可知道香水的重要了吧！</p>

<h3>談談化妝品</h3>
<p>— 恨石</p>
<p>審美觀念，基於人類的天性，尤其是女子，縱使醜如無監，有人譽之，則衷心喜悅，認為無上樂幸，設或加以貶詞，未有不忿然作色，銜恨刺骨者。所以凡是人類，沒有一個不愛美容。然而美之一字，無一定界說，必如何而可稱為美，因各個的目標不同，時代之修飾又各異，故面部的美麗，自難一定。在過去的時代中，人工的美容術，非常幼稚，且乏醫學常識，對於化妝用品，不外乎脂粉一項，但脂粉中富含鉛質，不但無益於皮膚，且毛孔吸收過久，皮膚的細泡組織，發生了變化，新陳代謝的作用，亦逐漸衰退，一旦脂粉洗去，皮膚色素，晦黯無光。所以昔時的人工美容術，非但不能發揮其美容效力，更有碍於健康。自科學昌明，醫藥進步，對於一切美容方法，日新月異，不分男女，如果面部上發生缺點，或障碍，在翳藥方面，不能治療；更可用藝術的方法來解决。即以化妝品中之雪花膏而論，其施用手續及包含成分，比較過去時代的脂粉，共優良程度，何啻霄壤。考雪花膏之配合成分，大部是一種脂粉，及各種芳香物混合而成。其主要原料，為硬脂酸（Stearie　Acid）石蠟·橄欖油·甘油·以及雙養水·硼酸等防腐劑，可以久藏不變；其他各種芳香劑，隨製者，或時代之需要，而各異其品。市上化妝品，其採用香料最昂貴者，據記者所知，首推大陸藥房出品的雅霜，其主要香品，每磅需國幣二百四十餘元，且訂有專的，祗該號獨家享受，不能分訂他家，故二十年來，在化妝品業中得獨佔一席。</p>
<p>雪花膏在中國市塲首先發行者，當推夏士蓮，其時交通未便，報紙廣告，亦鮮揄揚；僅通商口岸，得見此體質銀色的美容品，內地閨閣，固絕無僅有也。厥後白玉霜繼起，推廣不遺餘力，風行幾遍全國，而國貨化妝品的雅霜，亦乘機崛起，與舶品分庭抗禮。考雅霜之質料與香氣，固不失為國貨中佼俊者，惟因香料關係，久藏變色，實為美中不足；其醫學上的功效，能防止面部起皺，祛除一切斑點，因為空氣中塵埃飛揚，如果粘在皮膚組織之間，與皮下分泌的脂肪和汗合在一處，即變成黑色，或強烈的日光。嚴冷的朔風，曬傷或凍傷，如敷以雅霜，均有保護之功。其用法先以雅霜塗在指尖，用二拇指。擱在顴骨之上，再用二食指·在兩眼眼皮上，輕輕摩擦，如此反覆至數十次，叉可照同樣方法摩擦面部或手部臂部，使各部肌肉作用，非常發達，即能預防起皺；但必須耐久行之，方有成效。藍解剖學上筋肉纖維，非經摩擦，不能鬯行新陳代謝，又非用雅霜，不能刺激毛孔之吸收力也。至於曬傷或凍傷，在每决洗面時。先用雅霜塗之，再罨以熱手巾，約三分鐘，復用溫水以洗去雅霜，經過洗面之後，再行敷上，如此必可恢復原狀。</p>
<p>雅霜在醫學上之功效，既如上述，所以逐年銷行，由南而北，頗為社會信仰舶來品之能消聲匿跡，雅霜與有功焉。</p>
<p>與大陸雅霜同時發行者，尙有廣生行之雪花，質香亦臻上乘，惟容積較小，暢行於南方一帶，江浙皖三省，未見旺盛。近數年來，為雪花膏之勃興時代，如家庭工業社之蝶霜，東方工業社之愛的霜，五洲美容霜，大陸美女霜，中法孩兒面，百昌面友，試一披報紙，滿目皆是，其中瑜瑕互見，各有所長。本年新出品，更如雨後春筍，如永和之容友，同仁之面麗，太平之統治霜，百佳之荳蔻，美花之珠光霜，其他未見報紙，向各洋雜貨號寄售者，更不知凡幾。良以製造簡便，且無須大資本，現貨瓶料，又到處可購，但其中配台，是吾確能合乎醫理，非經試過者，不能知也。</p>
<h3>面麗的過去與現在</h3>
<p>— 藥師朱秋元</p>
<p>時代之輪，高速度地向前邁進着，一切的物質享受，當然也跟着時代而日新月異。就拿化妝品來談談吧，從前只知塗脂抹粉，是圖一時的潔白，一時的美觀；至於這粉搽用以後，是否能從美的方面改進，却沒有人去注意到。這樣看來，這脂粉終究是一種裝飾品，對於我們面部的皮膚，並沒有什麼益處，簡實是塗墙壁一樣，弄得那粗白而靑灰的面貌，竟沒有一天可以離得開他，這是一般劣質脂粉的罪惡吧。不過，在道科學發達的今日，醫學界對於道耗用廣大的美容，也已感覺到非常的缺點在起而改良了。「面麗」就是近年來新興的一種科學美容劑，並且是近年來僅有的含有醫療性質的化妝品。我們知道婦女們不能不抹粉，更知道婦女們所深惡痛疾的，是雀斑面皰等害容惡症，所以根據這兩點，「面麗」就從雪花粉方面改進，完全用醫藥的原理來處方。「面麗」不但能够滋養皮膚，保持靑春的美，而且還能消滅美容最大的障碍物——雀斑和面皰，雪花粉是硬脂酸和鹹性的化合物，裏面還有一些甘油，牠的能力，至多限於潤膚，做粉底子用，搽了以後，仍是要撲乾粉。在搽用的是覺得非常麻煩，而且還是非常不經濟。「面麗」就把這香粉和雪花膏融合於一爐，經過化學上幾度的考慮，方才把各種美容除斑的藥粉，加入在裹面，搽在面上，有薄施脂粉丯姿嫣然的妙處。不過有一點要聲明的，「面麗」所含的粉質，絕對不是鉛質香粉的一類，却是與皮膚絕對有益的藥粉，因此，結果成續，很是滿意，在這忽忽的四五年中，絡續收到各界仕女治好省斑面皰以後的謝信，竟有好幾百封的多。這種光榮的收獲，我們深覺苦心研究的値得，同時在化妝品中，別開生面的獨樹一幟，佔有了一席地位「面麗」經中央衛生署發給了一二力八號的成藥許可證，化妝品而得到此項證書的，似乎還沒有吧。「面麗」從前已有ABC三種香味，最近，我們更特製D種香味，這是價値極高貴的一種香料，確然要比衆芬芳，幽靜可愛，我們深信一定可以得到各界仕女普遍的同情的，完了，祝各界新年納福。</p>
<h3>美容品之責任</h3>
<p>— 凌乃萍</p>
<p>愛美乃爲人類天性，據歷史所載，如張敞之有畫眉樂事，何郎之擅敷粉風流，叉如北地個脂佳人似玉，南朝金粉美女如花，故美容品之由來，我國自古即尙，惜其時物質的享受，不能與現時科學時代的享用並論，際此美容品彌漫一時，充斥於市，形形色色，多不勝計的今日，愛美士女，不可不注意美容品之選探，以為裝臺良伴，修飾佳品，而美容品之製造者，更不可忘却製造美容品所應負的責任，切不可專事利用整天價響的新奇宣傳方式，而以劣質混世圖利，須着重配製與功效，方不負製造美容品之責任，這樣，愛美者有所愛，物得實用，出品者受人歡迎，相得益彰。</p>
<p>我人因天賦的形相姿態，各有不同，有嬌嫩艷麗者，有具健康美之色相者，欲保持其美顏永駐，不因氣候風塵年事之侵襲而衰老，甚至化醜陋為妍美，變粗黑為白嫩，非應用時代性的美容品不為功，庶幾增進麗質，永駐靑春。據筆者所知，富貝康化裝品無限公司，歷史悠久，向為思想前進科學化的時代美容品生產的代表，其最著名最珍貴之出品——白嫩除斑特效劑一好友」，確能改造皮膚裏老組織，屏除美容上一切障碍，久已爲數千萬士女所愛用，該公司其他著名出品，如百雀香粉，百雀胭脂，富貝康花露香水，富貝康美髮霜，美髮漿，甜心香水等等不下數十種，莫不精美絕倫，到處風行，誠乃久負盛名之美麗天使，非同凡響。</p>

<p>敎育槪况</p>
<h3>難童中學</h3>
<p>神聖的「八一三」抗戰的砲火爆發以後、上海市許多男女童軍、他們為了要維護祖國而瘋狂地發動了、無論在戰塲、在後方、他們都呈獻過自己的力量、這是國民應盡的責任、因此他們都抱了為祖國而犧牲的决心、所以在淞滬的抗戰中、他們是有過不少可歌可泣的故事、這、當然至今仍深印在社會人士的腦海中的、</p>
<p>自從國軍西移後、這廣大的青年童軍、有的從軍馳騁疆塲、有的為了家鄉在殘暴的敵人蹂躪下、而流離失所在這死寂的孤島上、本市童子軍理事會、因此便有難童中學的創辦、給他們以給養、給他們以敎育、為祖國培植英才、同時深得本市慈善團體聯合救災會、以及難民救濟分會的經濟上的援助、所以許多流離失所的男女童軍、乃繼續獲得敎育的機會、</p>
<p>該校創辦至今快一學年了、校　為趙慰祖、為了校舍的關係、上學期在天津路太平銀行上課、暑期又暫遷於智仁勇女校、這學期遷定在康腦脫路徐園內了、徐園本來是滬上的一個有名私人花園、可是現在是一片荒蕪了、他們在頹垣瓦礫中建築了一座大的蘆蓆棚、來作他們以敎以養的所在、而百數難單便在其中埋頭發　了、在如此情况之下、該校的敎導方面、當然是極端採取嚴格了、本學期的敎員、有孫移新·夏煥新·徐正誼·徐禧·楊綠村·蕭子傑等十幾位、都是本市敎育界知名之士、他們都願在純盡義務下來給以精神上的帮助、至於職員、也是如此的、</p>
<p>該校上學期本來設有高中部的、這學期為了經費上的困難、所以僅有初中三級、共學生百數十人、女生也有近一十人、他們日常的生活是在嚴格童軍管理中、一律穿着國貨藍布工裝、上半天學課、下半天術課、每星期六輪流露營一次、課外尚有歌詠隊·平劇·話劇·書法等研究會的組織、近來該校為着顧及到學生的出路問題、擬趨向於職業敎育方面去、授以學生生產技能、現在已成立一個廣告書社、最近擬設備印刷部及其他的小型工塲、現正請由專家在計劃中、但經濟方面當然是困難的、聞尚希社會慈善人士、能給以帮助才好、</p>
<p>這學期來、該校對於社會人士給以他們的同情與援助、是深切地感到愉悅和奮勉、他們堅决地要在經濟的窘迫之中苦幹下去、</p>

<h3>人狼惡鬭</h3>
<p>— 力士</p>
<p>據各方消息：這幾天整個世界已為寒浪所襲，不論在美洲，在歐洲，在遠東，都呈着嚴寒；而在上海，也因為西比利亞高氣壓的侵擾，朔風凜冽，極感冷酷。</p>
<p>已經消失對抗大自然力量的現代人，怎堪嚴寒的突擊和侵迫？所以到了冬季，便有許多貧苦朋友凍斃事件的發生，今年當然不能例外；在美國已有所聞，中國想必更多，而在羅馬尼亞，却更發生一件『人狼惡心鬥』的慘劇：</p>
<p>『山中餓狼因天氣嚴寒，無處　食，昨乃成羣侵入勃魯斯吐里村。村人各執刀斧鋤鏟，與之惡鬥，歷兩小時之久。結果，村人死四名，狼死十四頭』。（路透社十二月二十九日羅京電。）</p>
<p>狼是最殘忍的動物，個性旣貪戾凶惡，行為更狡詐險毒，牠不但會吞噬弱小的禽獸，如兔，如鹿，如鳥，也會戕害人類；然而却跳躍不出大自然的支配圈。勃魯斯吐里村山區的狼為要生存，牠們便不得不走開那『無處　食』的所在，而闖入人村，企圖挽救牠們的饑餓；但也知道這行動的危險，因此『成羣』結隊，這也許可以說是牠們的『聰明』，可是究竟敵不過人類的智慧；勃魯斯吐里村人知道以『團結』來對付『成羣』的狼，以『刀斧鋤鏟』的工具來對付『毒齒利爪』的武器。終於克服了當前的困難，粉碎了狼的企圖。</p>
<p>這一幕『人狼惡鬥』劇，歷時竟有二小時之久，我們可以推想到當時情形的緊張和爭鬥的激烈；同時依照人與狼的死亡數來推想、也可以知道當時參加惡鬥的人數和狼數的衆多。雖說這塲惡鬥，勃魯斯吐里村人未獲全勝，也有相當的犧牲，但這犧牲的代價却是偉大的，它不獨鬥勝了食狼的侵襲，而且說明了唯有視死如歸的犧牲精神，纔能保全　村的安全，纔能免除貪狼的蹂躪；換句話說：勃魯斯吐里村人如果大難當前，不知忍痛犧牲，祇圖掩門自安，那麼，便無法逃避貪狼的吞嚙，它的結果，將超過這時慘痛的程度。</p>
<p>這一則花邊新聞，本身的價值，也許不高，但給正在苦鬥中的中國同胞讀了，却可以作為他山之助。</p>
<h3>國歷新年在上海</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>新年總多少有些新年的氣象，然而國歷雖已頒佈了多年，國歷新年的氣象，還是敵不過陰歷的新年，祇是使有閒階級，享福的人們，多一個狂歡的機會，一年要過兩度新年，國歷新年過去不久，還有一個陰歷的新年。這種習俗，不知到了何年何月，才會破除？</p>
<p>單就上海說來，國歷元旦，除了幾條繁華的馬路上，一部分商店鐵門拉緊了，寫着新年休假一天或三天的字條，青天白日旗拉到旗桿頂上，隨風飄展以外，什麼都和平時一樣。如果你碰見了一個知識程度較低的人或是普通的工人，問他今天是什麼日子，他準會不加猶豫的回答你：「是外國年初一—」這個年初一是外國的，和中國人不相干。關於這，我們可以看出廢除習俗的不容易。</p>
<p>然而吃過中飯，你在元旦那天，走到街上，立刻可以看出電影院，京戲館，生意特別好。「客滿」的牌子掛在門口，鐵門也拉緊着，有了錢看不到戲，會使你有些嘔氣。但如果看電影，不在乎了，買下一塲的票子，在鐵門口老等着，雖是飽嘗西北風的味道，却準會看到。游戲塲也每家客滿：夜晚，跳舞塲的熱鬧，自不必說，這豈不是充滿了新年的氣象嗎？可是祇限於有閒的，享福的人們，勞動界還不是和平常一樣，在奔走，在工作嗎？孩子們也不像陰歷元旦，換上新衣，娘兒姐兒也家常衣服，新裝是留待陰歷新年出下子風頭的。</p>
<p>在街市上特別使你感到滑稽的，是賣日曆和曆書的人，「要哇老法新暦本，六個銅板買一本。」旣然是新暦本，為何要冠上「老法」兩字，矛盾得使你可笑。前幾年不是日曆上不准加印陰曆嗎？然而現在五顏六色的日曆，又那一種不是陰陽合璧，否則就不會有主顧。事實告訴我們，陰曆的完全廢除，至少要隔相當的時日。</p>
<p>然而話得說回來，在我們的記憶上，自國民政府成立而後，三令五申，曾着令民間一體奉行國曆。有過一個年頭，在上海市當局嚴令之下，南市，閘北，自國曆元旦起，不拘大小商店，一律休業三天，大敲其年鑼鼓，春聯對也貼滿在店門上，爆竹更放去不少。同一年頭，上海各學校，陰曆新年照常上課，敎育局派員調查，如果查到私自放假的，從嚴處罰。但是現在，又回復到陰盛陽衰之路。總之，自頒行國曆以後，那次的新年最過得有聲有色了！</p>
<p>新年的結徵　桑子</p>
<p>新是舊的對稱，所以新的成立，必須要有其舊的對象，要是新而沒有舊來做對象，舊而沒有新來作比較，那麼為新為舊，就根本失去了它的理論的基礎。同時新舊的分野，也不能以歷史的眼光來觀察，而只有時間性和空間性的關係。例如「新年」之於「舊年」，祇是歲年的不同，社會形態並無多大差別；而且我們往往可以看到：在這裏以為新的，在那邊恰以為是舊；在過去時候以為舊的，而現在未始不可以謂之新。所以新之為新，完全以適應時代環境為唯一條件。</p>
<p>「推陳出新」是社會上的自然現象，也是社會的自然趨勢。大學上說：「湯之盤銘曰：茍日新，日日新，又日新。」便是社會進化的原則。一般現象或形態的演變，倘然缺乏客觀的條件，不合社會進化的原則，縱是標新，亦僅徒見立異而已，結果，必致自趨幻滅，自招覆敗。譬如：一般「傀儡」標榜的「新政府」，日本的唱導「新秩序」，它的成因，它的內涵，我們姑且暫置不論，卽以它的形態而言，亦違反一般政治的，或者國際的常理。它的命運，它的結局，是可以預知的了。</p>
<p>我們深深的相信：一切偽裝的新，將在焦土中成長起來的新中國的精神，新中國的建設，新中國的武力之前，而粉碎，而崩潰。新年並已告訴我們：「將為利於中國之潮流轉嚮的結徵。」</p>
<h3>浮生若夢</h3>
<p>— 燕華</p>
<p>“You　Can't　Take　it　with　you”</p>
<p>哥倫比亞出品　國泰大戲院映</p>
<p>佛蘭克開潑拉最初的作品受到世界銀壇矚目的，該是「一夜風流，」以後他陸續製作了「富貴浮雲」「桃源艷跡」等片。「浮生若夢」是開潑拉繼「桃源艷跡」以後的新作，原劇舞台台本曾經得過潑力士獎金，電影編劇人羅勃脫雷司金更是哥倫比亞公司著名的編劇人。</p>
<p>全片著名演員，一共有十餘人，其中比較著名的為愛德華特愛勞特，飾銀行界的大企業家；里昂巴里摩亞飾一個年已古稀退居家園的老人；琪恩惡瑟飾里昂巴里摩亞的孫女，同時是大銀行家兒子的戀人；詹姆士史都華飾愛德華特愛勞特的兒子，同時又是琪恩的戀人；一向飾喜劇丑角的密夏奧飾一個俄國跳舞敎師。</p>
<p>全片故事很簡單，說老人孫女和銀行家之子熱戀，但因階級懸殊，以致老人孫女羞恨交迸而出走，結果老人所住住宅區域亦被迫出售，另一銀行家因此破產殞命，最後此擁有極大經濟權威之銀行家，因愛子離家，另一銀行家之死，都使他感觸事業之不可靠，乃擺脫一切，赴老人之家與衆狂歡作樂。</p>
<p>這影片，當我個人坐在戲院裏，當影片放映的一百廿分鐘，（全片有十四本），它的確使我激動得利害。看完全片，計有三種感想；</p>
<p>第一，這劇本的劇作人，和「富貴浮雲」差不多，他們都是否定現在這個金元社會的制度的，他們對於那些摩天大樓，以及一切奢華的物質，表示憤　與不平。「富貴浮雲」中把自己的田地家產分給所有窮苦的農民，「浮生若夢」中，銀行企業家擺脫一切事業而退休。</p>
<p>第二，我們認為劇作者的出發點是對的，就是他否定現在金元社會，但是他的行動是錯誤的，他把「富貴浮雲」及「浮生若夢」的主角，都寫成一個個人主義，這便是這兩個劇本最大的錯誤。</p>
<p>第三，我們絕對否定「浮生若夢」的主旨，以為「金錢是身外之物，你死了又不能把牠帶走」，於是像銀行家一樣把事業丟開。我們以為，為大衆謀利的一切公共事業，當然是應當去做的，假如為了個人的福利而剝削大衆，這是應該被大衆唾棄的。像「浮生若夢」那樣看法，那只是代表消極的個人主義罷了。</p>
<p>不過整個戲，的確異常成功，尤其是情感豐滿的地方，它能使人感動得不能自己的流下熱涙來，比如在寫人情可愛的地方，導演的手腕，深入淺出，卓越，潑刺，的確不愧為優越的導演人。全片空氣的對照非常强烈，我們在以下數塲，尤可窺見一斑：　銀行家叩裴戰勝了另一銀行家，握住了經濟界的權威，這時用三種手法，寫叩裴孤獨與感喟，第一是叩裴的職員催他開會；第二，是另一破產的銀行界進來大罵叩裴，說他將來會和他一樣（說後昏厥）；第三，是叩裴的兒子進來對他父親告別。叩裴含了熱涙由會塲奔出來……。　法庭審問那塲，法官判老人罰金一百元，大家拒絕叩裴的錢，在法庭上一呼而募捐出來，以及最後琪恩的高聲狂罵，叩裴夫人昏厥，攝影記者衝入，庭上大亂……。　最後在老人家中，叩裴參加他們的口琴演奏，羣衆歡呼狂舞……。這三個塲面都太興奮，太有力量了。</p>
<p>愛德華愛勞及里昂巴里摩亞戲最多，演得也極成功，琪恩，史都華都很好。</p>

<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第一回　獨臂翁組織自由村　雙胞女禮膽先烈墓</p>
<p>說起那位校長來，他今年也六十多歲了。他本來也是這裏一個鄉下人，因為他曾經讀過幾年書，二十年以前，在一個鄉鎮上，開過一家私塾，招收了二三十個學生。那學生中，大的十五六歲，小的七八歲，年歲不齊，程度也不一。好在他是有敎無類，無論那一家兒童要來念書，他是來者不拒。雖然是個村塾，倒也並非是「天地元黃喊一年」，他也用新式的敎科書，也倣照了城裏那種學校的課堂式，先生的背後，也有一塊黑板，他常常用粉筆，把生字講解給學生們聽。不過地方是簡陋得很的，他原是借了一家土地廟，擺了幾張板桌，幾條長凳，就算數了。他每半年，收人家每人一塊錢的學費，書籍紙張，不在其內，大概半年工夫，也不過兩三角錢。那地方的農村人家，也還勤懇，田地上出產也還豐富，讀得起書的兒童也多。所以那一個村鎮上的孩子，差不多都是他的學生。不過他有一個脾氣，早晨一起身，就到鎮上的小茶館裏來，便是洗臉漱口，也是在小茶館裏。一把紫沙茶壺，自己帶點茶葉，每日破費三個銅圓的開水，直要喝到上午九點鐘的辰光，他便去上課了。一到下午四點鐘，他放了學後，又到小茶館裏來，因此人家喚他做「茶館　頭」。但是鄉下人以農為本，一到了農忙的時候，便是兒童們，也要帮助着到田裏工作。就是做不動的孩子們，也要送送飯，看看牛，所以在這個時候，那位村塾先生是空閑了，一天到晚，就在小茶館裏。後來他想出了個主意來了：城裏的學校，一年放兩次假。一次呌做暑假，是在熱天放的；一次呌做寒假，是在冷天放的。他那裏的學塾，一年也放兩次假。一次呌做播種假，是在初夏時候放的。而且這個鄉村裏，還有不少養　人家，也在那時最忙。一次呌做收割假，是在秋天放的。這幾天也是最忙的時候，兒童們也要帮着他們的大人，做田間工作，到收割完畢以後，也要休息幾天，娛樂一塲，所以在此時間放假，他也以為最合宜的。　（二）</p>

<p>遊藝界新年號</p>
<h3>去年電影界的悲歡離合</h3>
<p>— 銀鴿</p>
<p>一年來的孤島電影界，大體上是在向着復與之途邁進，新華。華新的積極撬片，藝華的復活，以及夭聲。國華暨甫各公司的創立，都足以顯示電影事業是有了新的生機。而在人事方面，却也有不少悲歡離合之事，足供吾人回憶，現在且分門別類，記述於后：</p>
<p>（一）悲</p>
<p>一幕悲劇的演出，一顆巨星的殞落，尙冠武的「嗚呼哀哉」，是一年來電影界最重大的損失，許多人因為尙冠武在銀幕上有相當的成就，所以為他之死而隕淚，而扼腕太息，道但為他和靄與誠懇，也是賺取人們同情的主耍原因。最不幸的是尙冠武之死，距離他與殷秀岑的外甥女兒結婚不上幾個月，使殷秀岑的外甥女兒做了「新嫁娘」不久就遽作「未亡人」，當債冠武逝世以後，陳屍殯儀館的時候，尙夫人一面揮淚，一面對人說：「我不信他眞的死了！這是一慕戲呀！」這話多麼凄凉！</p>
<p>（二）歡</p>
<p>陳燕燕誕生了一頭雛燕，那是去年十一月二十二日的事，三朝那天，陳燕燕大發紅蛋，諸親好友每位一律十二顆，童叟無欺；到了彌月之期，且在蜀腴川菜館大開湯餅之宴，電影界男女明星，多數應邀而到，不啻舉行了一决影人大會串。陳燕燕與他的「外子」黃紹芬，殷勤招待，見了人，陳燕燕是眉歡眼笑，黃紹芬也是眉歡眼笑。</p>
<p>（三）離</p>
<p>一年來影人鬧着離異的有兩起，一起是余光與梅琳，余光原名余福康，梅琳原名錢兆琳，結婚之前，錢兆琳的父親會向余福康提出條件，就是不許再拍影戲，婚後余福康會一度以岳父的推薦，進一家礦產公司做事，因為混得不甚得法，後來纔改名余光，重上銀幕，不久他的妻子錢兆琳，也改名梅琳加入了電影圈，兩人婚後，數年間已養了兩個孩子，不幸去年的春天，梅琳突然受了物力的引誘，與一位嚴醫生發生了曖昧關係，余光與梅琳，終於因此離了婚。</p>
<p>第二起是陸露明與許幸之，戰後，許幸之離滬赴港，久久不歸，而陸露明在上海接連主演了「日出」「桃色新聞」數片，在電影界裏突然紅了起來，待到許幸之重回上海，陸露明已成為一位汽車階級的懷抱中的愛人，與許幸之的同居關係，就此無形中止了。</p>
<p>（四）合</p>
<p>去年的電影界裏，成就了兩對因緣，一對是陳燕燕與黃紹芬，他倆的訂婚與結婚都是公開的。另一對是袁美雲與王引，道一雙情侶的結合，往時採取一半合開一半秘密的形式，戰後纔正式成為夫婦。一年來影侶仳離的有兩對，而結合的同樣有兩對，恰好「收支兩訖」。</p>
<h3>風流自負的卓別麟　六位美人……曇花一現！　不知寳華女士有何感想？</h3>
<p>— 方爾牧</p>
<p>滑稽宗匠卓別麟，在好萊塢電影史上保持着十五年的地位，迄今仍受着世人的歡迎，擁護着，這位資麗女士是他第七位的主要人物，她和卓氏合演的「摩登時代」開映後，轟動了全球，不過該片到德國的當兒，為了排斥猶太人的關係，（卓氏是猶人）受了一點的小波動。</p>
<p>回憶卓氏十五年前是一九二三年，那時好萊塢在默片的時代，他同傑克柯根合演的「尋子遇仙」，片中的女主角是愛黛娜，是他目光中注意的人物她帮助卓氏攝了好幾張滑稽短片，得着了相當的地位，繼續演着那卓氏自編自導的「巴黎一婦人」。到後她放棄了銀幕的工作，住在好萊塢過她快樂的生活。第二位是哈立師，卓氏看上了她，拍了幾部影戲，他們就結婚了，不久有了個兒子，可是在落地時就夭亡了；因此雙方發生了衝突，各自分離。列泰是西班牙的舞女，她生着一變黑閃如流電般的眼子和柳條似的腰身，抓住了卓氏的歡心，立刻實行同居，生了兩個兒子，同時呢，卓氏預攝淘金記」，用她來充女主角，但是她善演舞台劇的，所以無可如何的問題內把她離開了，賠償了好多的津貼費。海爾是第四位不幸的女子，她呢，繼續攝着「淘金記」未完的一部份，不久投入福期公司，現在她隱退了。再講第五位凱乃第，卓氏和她演的取馬戲團作背景的，中國的譯名是「馬戲」，費了十五個月把牠攝竣，這位凱女士就離開了卓氏。第六位是邱吉爾，她是芝加哥的交際花，他把她介紹到好萊塢攝張一城市之光」，扮演個盲目的賣花女子，拍了十三個月就完了，聽說她現在嫁給一位倫敦的紳士。末了提起寳麗高黛，她出身是演舞台劇的，得了卓氏的靑睞，合演了「摩登時代」，他們表面上沒有結婚，可是曙地裹實行同居了。最近電影雜誌上載着他們分居的消息了，這不過是捕風捉影之談，付之一笑，將來的結果，我也未便預測了。</p>
<h3>伶人動態　顧無爲從香港抵申</h3>
<p>香港利舞台標準劇團領袖人顧無爲，前日乘意大利輪抵申，昨與記者相晤，據稱此來任務，係解决家務及其他雜事，現標準團在港，支持局面，差堪敷衍，至人馬方面，歷在湘桂各地，收羅甚衆，在申如有相當角色，亦擬邀聘數人。下午顧君命其女顧寳蓮到卡爾登大戲院後台訪王熙春，詢問坤旦陳玉君之住址，藍陳在港，會客串於利舞台三天，甚受港人歡迎，殆顧氏欲聘之重返彼土也。顧氏又對記者表示，林樹森醞釀赴港，已非一日，迄未實現，如彼願往，則有談判合作之可能。</p>
<p>筱三麻子談判蟬聯</p>
<p>名伶筱三廠子自隸天蟾舞台以來，甚受觀衆歡迎，演至前日（除夕）止，已告期滿，前台正與筱伶談判蟬聯條件，要求每月取半數包銀，筱伶則堅持須三分之二，致未能妥協。惟雙方尙在折衡中，如一且决裂，筱伶演至三日止。（帮忙三天）即告晚離，或能挽回，演到年底封箱，明春如何，再行談判。</p>
<p>李仲林將應聘南下</p>
<p>董兆斌君組纖之中國舞台，自進行更新舞台未果後，現仍積極找尋地盤，一方面邀聘角色，由郭春圃君羅致之文武老生李仲林，已覆函允於大局穩妥後南下，包銀三千元，目前仲林在天津演出，頗受顧曲界之擁護。</p>
<h3>所謂眞美善</h3>
<p>— 嚴幼祥</p>
<p>拍影戲有三大耍素，即「眞美善是。眞為現實，美為藝術，至於善，就是不背人類的正義。這三個條件，為任何一種影片的焦點！也有人把「眞美善」不作此解，但是在目前的環境中，我却認為非如此說法不可。</p>
<p>我會經聽到朋友說過，現在中國電影漸遠於眞實，他的話也相當對，影片公司近來確乎有些轉變，不過在我個人有一個不移的主張，便是一部片子既離開「眞」而重於「美」，無論如何不能脫離「善」！要曉得人世間的一切，惟「善」足以永垂不朽，你要想一部影片有骨幹，使人有深切的感動，甚至受人擁戴，要點就是有「善」的存在！秦始皇建阿房宮，美則美矣，但善已盡失」到底被人唾罵！現在是什麼辰光，諸君合睫一思，當不以我言為河漢了。</p>
<p>去舊迎新，又是一年開始，除掉檢討過去之外，不能不考慮未來，我係電影從業員，三句不離本行，爰以區區感想，記之於上，有待於識者指正。</p>

<h3>賀楊情殺案上演</h3>
<p>— 缺水生</p>
<p>轟動全滬的賀蝶與楊懷椿情殺案發生後，各遊藝塲爭相採訪有關此案的情節，編爲劇本　演。大世界聯友話劇團，已編排就緒，定本月六日夜戲公演。該案主角楊懷椿姐夫徐君及范剛大律師之公子，特爲此事，走訪大世界經理丁永昌，和黃金榮先生公子元　，詢問劇情，並與聯友劇團務主任朱炎一度談話，深恐劇情與事實不符，淆亂聽聞，詳加指示，以便社會人士得以明瞭眞相。賀蝶由該團臺柱徐紉秋粉演，楊懷椿則爲風流小生尹夢石飾，兩人演技素博觀衆稱頌，屆時上演，定能將劇情發揮無遺，使觀衆對這雙一爲情犧牲一的有情人表同情，而爲之失聲痛哭也。悲哉！</p>
<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（六）（二）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>又　的譚派戲多是夫人所授</p>
<p>這位姑娘常好心打了套子讓老頭兒因爲心愛的是她，當然處處都不願稍拂其意。如此若干年來，老姑娘聽會的戲，至少也有個三五十齣，唱起來腔兒味兒都很神似老譚。又宸本來也常看老譚的戲，家裏又備了一架留聲機，所有老譚的七張半唱片，全都買來，一天到晚開着話匣子摹仿譚調；加以他天賦甚佳，很有一種脆亮的音兒。那時學譚的人原沒有幾個，賈洪林不久嗓子壞掉，王雨田又已早死，貴俊卿偏學譚的作派，同後來的賣狗兒是一個路子。又宸娶了老姑娘到家，閨房中「夫唱婦改，」不久竟把老泰山的幾齣偏重唱工的戲，都由他夫人傳授會啦。至於靠把戲同稍微帶點武工的，他就得擱把。（即拿不動意）記得有一回在大舞台，曾勉強貼了一齣定軍山，」海報上登出去准帶嶄淵，誰知這齣戲已唱了一半，他才說；「我底下來不了啦。後台管事明知他是不會，要是不唱斬淵，又恐台下看客起鬨，趕緊用汽車把張榮奎接到後台，（時榮奎已戲畢回家）同他好商量，才算把夏侯淵給斬啦。那時海報上常把「捉放」帶宿店「烏盆」帶行路等的帶字，寫成「代，似這齣「定軍山」當然也不能例外。不過別的「代一字全都不合講，獨然又宸這齣「定軍山代斬淵，」的確倒是用得適常；因為那是臨時煩張榮奎老板替他「代」勞的呢。</p>
<p>又宸首决蒞滬，是在民國初年，出演的地點是黃楚九主持的新新舞台，隨帶的琴師是孫老元，打鼓老是劉順，並且還替孫老懸了一塊「中國第一琴師一的牌子。孫劉二位都是他老岳的舊人，再加以一譚大王快壻的頭銜，當時也足以號召一氣。後來出演亦舞臺的時候，又用了徐蘭沅，杭子和，仍是老譚晚年用過的塲面，雖是這樣，還不敢保險能凖不出錯。有「回不佞聽他的捉放，」居然連唱兩句「馬行在夾道內難以回馬，」直把徐杭兩人急得滿頭大汗，連忙小聲告訴他下邊的一這才是花隨水水不能戀花，」他這才接了下去。可見跟着師娘學的能耐，甚不道地，何况他是師妹師太太所教的呢。話雖如此，可是在現在鬚生人才極度缺乏的時候，平良心說又宸的一進宮」「探母」「碰碑」「連營寨哭靈牌，」的確還有餘音繞樑的味兒，不幸他又短命死矣。我想倘有學譚腔而得不到叔岩的指示的，何妨去請教這位王夫人（老姑娘）呢。</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei Violates Discipline, Harms the Party and the Country; Central Standing Committee Resolves to Expel Him from the Party; He Leaves His Post Without Permission, Hides in Another Location, and Spreads Absurd Claims; Not Only is He Despised by the Central Government, But Also by the People of the Entire Nation; The Central Supervisory Committee Also Passes the Above Resolution in a Meeting</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee held a temporary meeting at 3:30 PM today. The Standing Committee members present were Feng Yuxiang, Wen Yuan, Juzheng, Ding Weifen, Zou Lu, Kong Xiangxi, Sun Ke, Chen Guofu, Yu Youren, Ye Chucang, He Yingqin, and Dai Chuanxian. The Executive Committee members attending as observers were Jiao Yitang, Chen Shuren, Jiang Bocheng, Wen Lanyou, Hong Ludong, Gan Naiguang, Xiao Tongzi, Wang Luyi, Qian Dajun, Wu Zhongxin, He Jian, Fang Jue, He Chengrong, Lin Yizhong, Xia Douyin, Xiao Jishan, Xu Kan, Liang Hancao, Chuan Bingchang, Chen Shaokuan, Liu Jiwen, Chen Cheng, Zhang Daofan, Wang Faqin, Zhu Jiahua, Zhang Qun, Chen Bulei, Zhou Qigang, and Dai Kuisheng. The Alternate Executive Committee members were Zhao Dihua, Zhu Qing, Wang Yongbin, Wang Gong, Chen Fangxian, Zhao Yunyi, Luo Jialun, and Zhang Zhen. The Supervisory Committee members were Jiang Zuobin, Lin Sen, Qin Zhen, Wang Zizhuang, He Yaozu, Yang Hu, Wu Jingheng, Lin Yunhai, Zhang Ji, Shao Lizi, and Wang Chonghui. The Alternate Supervisory Committee members were also present, including Di Ying and Wang Shijie. The meeting was chaired by the President, discussing the case of Wang Zhaoming violating discipline and harming the Party and the country. It was resolved that Wang Zhaoming be permanently expelled from the Party and removed from all positions. At the same time, the Central Supervisory Committee also held a temporary standing committee meeting and passed the above resolution. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Zhaoming, entrusted with important responsibilities by our Party, and at a time of urgent war, has left his post without permission, hidden in another location, and spread claims contrary to national policy. In a telegram sent on the 29th, he even based his absurd arguments on the enemy's Prime Minister Konoe's declaration to fundamentally destroy our country, seeking peace with the enemy. He published this in newspapers and widely distributed it, under the guise of advising the Central Government, using deceptive tricks to mislead the people. The content of his telegram is entirely in line with the enemy's demands, deliberately embellished, and unscrupulously reverses right and wrong, speaking on behalf of the enemy, and even goes further, assisting their deception. In terms of his actions, it is actually colluding with the enemy to seek surrender. In terms of its impact, it directly attempts to shake the foundation of the nation. Our country launched the War of Resistance for national salvation, with the deaths and injuries of over a million soldiers and the sacrifices of millions of compatriots. The deep and painful purpose is to fundamentally eliminate the enemy's aggressive schemes, so as to permanently protect the life of our nation and people for generations to come. For more than a year, the people have been spiritually united, and the soldiers have bravely given their lives, with everyone united in one heart, all concentrated under the leadership of the President of our Party, determined and unyielding, with the confidence to achieve victory. Now, the enemy's ambition to plot against us is becoming more obvious, and their tricks are becoming more vicious. This only makes our nation's indignation against the enemy more intense and our determination more firm. What Wang has said is not only despised by the Central Government, but also by the people of the entire nation. During the war, no citizen is absolutely allowed to violate the decisions of wartime national policy and act on their own initiative. Party discipline absolutely does not allow exceeding the Party's formal resolutions, violating Party rules, and expressing personal opinions. Wang Zhaoming's actions are a clear violation of discipline and harm to the Party and the country. With righteousness at stake, there is no room for leniency. He is hereby permanently expelled from the Party and removed from all positions, in order to rectify Party discipline and correct officialdom. Our people must know that the most important key to winning the War of Resistance lies in unified will and unwavering spirit. In the past, our nation suffered repeated foreign insults, such as the Song and Ming dynasties, which were merely the collapse of a dynasty of one surname and one family, not the destruction of our nation. However, the principle that led to defeat was that a small number of treacherous and evil officials in the court at that time lost all conscience, leading to destruction. It was definitely not that the people's morale and national strength were unable to resist the enemy. Therefore, today's War of Resistance requires rectifying discipline in order to boost morale, and eliminating discord in order to defeat the strong enemy. Looking at the enemy's recent poisonous schemes, they are actually trying to threaten our spirit and lead us to division and destruction. Our Party deeply knows that the national consciousness of our compatriots throughout the country has been universally promoted, and the great righteousness of the Spring and Autumn period has deeply penetrated people's hearts. Only by relying on a firm and unwavering spirit of struggle, strictly abiding by national policy, and unifying will, will final victory surely be achieved. From now on, the national policy of the War of Resistance will take the speech delivered by the President of our Party at the Central Memorial Week on the 26th of last month as the only standard. May all comrades and soldiers throughout the country follow this will and do their best. All speeches and actions that violate this spirit are not tolerated by national interests and laws, and are jointly rejected by the people of the country, in order to maintain the will of wartime and complete the mission of our Three People's Principles' revolution to save the country.

<p>(Chongqing) The government has not commented on Wang's telegram. Government officials state that they have not yet received the telegram, so there is no way to know whether the telegram was actually sent by Wang or by other parties. Therefore, they intend to wait until this matter is clarified before issuing a formal opinion. Well-informed sources have long expected Wang's efforts to seek a peaceful resolution to the Sino-Japanese War, but they are very surprised that Wang is taking this action at this time. It is reported that after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and before the fall of Nanjing and Hankou, Wang repeatedly proposed peace negotiations. However, each decision was rejected by Chairman Chiang and other political leaders due to their determination to resist the war. Various Chinese circles now believe that China's position is very solid, and that it has never been as good as it is today since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. They put forward the following four factors: (1) The Chinese army has been completely reorganized for long-term war; (2) Due to British and American loans, China's financial position has become more stable; (3) Because the British and Americans are suspicious of Japan's guarantee to protect the interests of third countries in China, China's international position has become stronger; (4) China is now more united than before. The southwestern and northwestern provinces are all united and solid as Chairman Chiang's backing to resist the Japanese army's deep invasion into the interior. The deeper the Japanese army invades, the more advantageous the Chinese army's resistance becomes. Chinese circles also say that if Wang had proposed peace negotiations after the fall of Hankou, the situation at that time would have been very unfavorable to China, and the impact would have been unimaginable. Today, the situation has greatly improved, but Wang is advocating this fallacy, which is really incomprehensible. They believe that Wang's move will not only be opposed by the government, but also strongly condemned by the people of the country. However, whether this telegram was actually sent by Wang is still a question. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) After Japanese Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro announced his policy towards China, Wang Jingwei immediately sent a telegram advocating peace. Most newspapers here have commented on this. The far-right newspaper "Little Daily News" stated, "At the time when Wang Jingwei issued a peace proposal, the US government also issued a note to Japan, refusing to accept the unilateral abolition of the Open Door Policy. The coincidence of these two events should not be ignored. The Japanese government anticipated that the United States was afraid of taking direct action, and that the United States' natural ally would not have time to attend to other matters, so it resorted to speculative means. What we urgently want to know after Wang Jingwei's telegram is whether the Chinese side will respond accordingly, so that Japan can use the will of a large part of the Chinese people as an excuse to silence the United States. On the contrary, no one on the Chinese side responded to the peace proposal. Japan still believes that the US government will abide by the legacy of former President Washington, 'Do not provoke disputes,' and disregard the US government's condemnation." The moderate newspaper "Order" stated, "After Wang Jingwei defected, the people in the northern provinces of China, who mostly supported the Zhili clique more than ten years ago, may not respond to him. Although there is talk that a certain general in southern China intends to organize a government in Guangzhou, even if this government is established, its power will not be enough to consolidate Japan's power in southern China. Based on this, even though Japan uses the excuse of inciting disputes, falsely claiming that the government led by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is disintegrating, the National Government can still maintain unity in its will to resist the aggressor. Unless the conditions proposed by Japan are compatible with the right of the Chinese nation to survive, there can be no peace talks." The radical socialist newspaper "Republican" stated, "Although Chongqing was shaken after Wang Jingwei's telegram advocating peace was published, there is no evidence for Japan's claim that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek actually agreed with Wang Jingwei to conduct peace talks." (31st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Reuters learned today that Chinese circles in London are regretful about the "peace" telegram that Wang Jingwei allegedly sent to Chairman Chiang, fearing that it would give the outside world the incorrect impression that members of the Chinese government have split. They firmly stated that, leaving aside the fact that Wang's faction is unhappy with the government's alliance with the Communists, the vast majority of other Chinese people sincerely support Chairman Chiang. It is worth noting that Chairman Chiang's condemnation of Japan's peace proposals has been supported by the entire country. Therefore, there is no possibility of negotiating peace with Japan at this time. The Chinese circles also rejected Japan's intention to have China join the Japanese "Manchukuo" economic group, because this move would be tantamount to placing China under Japan's complete control. Commentators on Wang's actions are generally suspicious of the forces around him, but everyone scoffs at the rumors that Wang will join one of the two governments in Nanjing or Peiping under Japan's protection. They also believe that Wang's failure in this move may try to obtain more moderate conditions from Japan and present them to Chairman Chiang. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday morning, Tokyo received Wang Jingwei's telegram to Chairman Chiang advocating peace. The telegram has been published in various morning newspapers, but because the entire country of Japan is engaged in New Year celebrations, it has not been criticized. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese officials are currently refusing to criticize Wang Jingwei's "peace" telegram to Chairman Chiang. Although Japanese newspapers have published Wang's telegram in a prominent position, they are still keeping silent. This is probably because they believe that Wang has misunderstood several key points of Konoe's proposals, and they are waiting for the government to comment first before following up.

<h3>The Situation of the War of Resistance Has Greatly Improved; Politics Should Be More Important Than Military Affairs in the Future; The National Government Held a Memorial Ceremony for the Founding of the Republic of China Yesterday; Chairman Lin's Speech Most Strongly Urged Compatriots Throughout the Country to Endure Hardships and Struggle</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The National Government held a memorial ceremony for the founding of the Republic of China at 8:00 AM on New Year's Day, presided over by Chairman Lin, who led the ceremony and delivered a speech on the spot. The ceremony was then concluded. (1st dispatch)</p>
<p>Chairman Lin's Speech</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, today is New Year's Day of the 28th year of the Republic of China, which is also the anniversary of the founding of our Republic of China twenty-seven years ago, and also the anniversary of the inauguration of our Chinese Kuomintang's Premier Sun Yat-sen as the first President of the Republic of China in the first year of the Republic. Because of the Premier's advocacy of revolution, the Republic of China was founded. And because of the Premier's inauguration as President, the republican government and democratic politics were produced. Therefore, in holding this memorial ceremony today, in addition to the usual celebration of this year's New Year's Day, we must also very piously pay our respects to our Premier for his revolutionary spirit, and more practically examine our past work achievements and determine our future efforts. On the one hand, we must correct our past shortcomings, and on the other hand, we must improve our future effectiveness, continue our Premier's revolutionary legacy, and complete our Premier's unfinished business, so as not to fail the hard work of our Founding Father in creating the Republic of China, and not to fail this glorious and great anniversary today. Speaking of the work of the past year, in the military aspect, since the launch of the all-out war of resistance, thanks to the capable command of our military commander Chairman Chiang, the loyal and brave service of all the officers and soldiers, and the joint struggle of the people of the whole country, during the first phase of the war of resistance, the enemy's strategies of "subjugating China without a fight" and "quick victory" have been shattered. During this year and six months of combat, although we have lost many lands and cities, strategically speaking, not only has the enemy's plan become a bubble and completely failed to materialize, but we have also fully reaped the beneficial effects of "protracted war" and "war of attrition." This cannot but be regarded as our great success in the military. Now the military has entered a new stage in the second phase of the war of resistance, and our strategy has also undergone a new determination. The focus of future warfare will be to strive for the initiative and focus on attacking the enemy's rear, so that the enemy will be in a passive position, exhausted, and sink deeper and deeper, with no possibility of further incursion. And the main force of our army is not only still intact, but also gradually strengthened. Most of the future combat will be in mountainous areas, and the deeper the enemy goes, the more difficult it will be, and the situation will be more favorable to us. We will surely be able to achieve the goals of "protracted war," "total war," and "striving for the initiative." The overall situation of the war of resistance will definitely improve greatly. We can deeply believe that the enemy will absolutely not be able to conquer China, and we will definitely be able to persist in resisting the war to the end and strive for the final victory.</p>
<p>Implementing the Program of Resistance and National Reconstruction</p>
<p>As for the political aspect, in order to adapt to the needs of the war of resistance, there have also been considerable improvements in the middle of the past year. For example, the adjustment of political institutions, the establishment of public opinion organs, the achievements of diplomatic operations, the consolidation of the financial foundation, the active economic construction, and the maintenance and promotion of education and culture are all quite significant achievements. In addition, other administrative, legislative, judicial, examination, and supervisory affairs have been able to complete their special wartime tasks thanks to the serious supervision of the responsible officials and the diligence of their staff. The people have also been able to work together with one heart and one mind, whether in the war zone, the guerrilla zone, or in other areas, enduring all suffering, firmly determined to resist the war, with the belief in victory, supporting the government, obeying the leader, contributing manpower and material resources, not shunning sacrifice, and fighting in unison, fulfilling the responsibilities that everyone should fulfill. This is something that we can be proud to tell the people of the country. However, in this second phase of the war of resistance, politics should be more important than military affairs, the rear should be more important than the front, and the people should be more important than the army. We not only cannot be complacent about these small achievements in the past, but we must especially know that the great difficulties ahead will deepen day by day, and that our responsibilities will increase day by day. We must go further and continue to cultivate and struggle. From this New Year's Day, we must determine our future efforts, with the sole purpose of implementing the Program of Resistance and National Reconstruction. We must deeply understand that only this Program of Resistance and National Reconstruction is our established national policy, and only it is our guiding principle and clear direction for future efforts. Only by implementing the Program of Resistance and National Reconstruction, so that the various clauses and needs in this program can be completely fulfilled one by one, can we complete the National Revolution and implement the Three People's Principles in a practical and bright way.</p>
<p>Everyone Takes on Extraordinary Responsibilities</p>
<p>We must especially know that the purpose of the war of resistance is to maintain international peace and promote the great harmony of the world. And because of the evolution of our country's special history and the urgency of the situation, the two matters of war of resistance and national reconstruction have a kind of inseparable relationship. Without war of resistance, there can be no national reconstruction, and without national reconstruction, there can be no war of resistance. The two are to complement each other and advance simultaneously. We must both resist the war and build the nation in order to achieve our goal. The degree of hardship and difficulty in this work of building the nation in the war of resistance and resisting the war in national reconstruction is naturally not comparable to ordinary times. In this extraordinary era, we must take on this extraordinary responsibility. If we do not make extraordinary efforts in extraordinary times, we will not be able to complete our extraordinary tasks. As the ancients said, "The plan for the year lies in spring, and the plan for the day lies in morning." I hope that all our comrades and compatriots throughout the country will start from today, make the determination to start anew, embrace the spirit of self-improvement, endure hardships and struggle, redouble our efforts, and complete our great mission of resisting the war and building the nation, so as not to fail this glorious memorial today. Finally, we must respectfully wish the Republic of China long live, and the health of everyone. (1st dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Victorious Situation in the Second Phase of the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>In terms of the qualitative transformation of the overall situation of the War of Resistance, after the Chinese army abandoned Wuhan, it has shifted from the first phase of retreat and defense to the second phase of guerrilla warfare and counter-offensive. In this second phase of the War of Resistance, China has gained the advantage of exhausting the enemy and strengthening itself, which was created in the first phase, and the prospect of victory is becoming more apparent.</p>
<p>In the military aspect, the casualties of more than 500,000 Japanese soldiers and the consumption of countless firearms have made them lose the false prestige of a first-class power. At the same time, the Chinese army has gradually retreated after obtaining considerable gains from various points and lines, and has now lured the enemy deep into the mountainous areas. This has not only extended the battle line, dispersed and weakened the enemy's military strength, but also turned the battlefield into a plane, so that the enemy's land and water routes cannot echo each other, and heavy weapons lose their power. It is also easier for the Chinese army to change the positional warfare into mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare, and change the passive defensive warfare into offensive warfare. Recently, the widespread establishment, strengthening, and expansion of Chinese guerrilla teams in various areas in front of and behind the Japanese army will make the Japanese army even more exhausted. In future battles, the contrast between the Japanese side's consumption of firearms and soldiers and the Chinese army's will increase. This is the fatal wound of their failure and the key to China's victory.</p>
<p>Politically, from the beginning of the War of Resistance to the present, the entire Chinese nation has embraced the determination to resist the war for a long time. This has shattered the Japanese side's conspiracies such as "using Chinese to control Chinese" and "quick victory." Recently, although Wang Jingwei suddenly issued his personal bizarre views, the government and the people have risen up to denounce them, which is enough to prove that their will to resist the war is extremely firm and cannot be shaken. At the same time, the gradual reform of China's political institutions, the increasing strengthening of political work in the army, and the increasing political awareness of the people and their participation in the war have enhanced the comprehensiveness of the War of Resistance. On the other hand, although the Japanese side has also bought puppets and puppet troops in the occupied areas, these ugly people, who are abandoned by the masses, cannot play a significant role. Moreover, many of them are not convinced and often have the crisis of rebellion and returning to the right path. Furthermore, the protracted war of aggression has given the Japanese soldiers and people more and more damage and pain every day. Therefore, the undercurrent of war-weariness and anti-war sentiment is rising. The anti-war activities of the People's Front in the country, and the rebellions and disturbances of the puppet troops and the people of Korea and Taiwan are all seen facts, and they will definitely spread and expand in the future. This is not only shaking the Japanese army's morale and the people's hearts, but also igniting the sparks of the Japanese domestic revolution.</p>
<p>Economically, the Japanese side's financial resources are being consumed three or four times more in this war than China's, resulting in a tendency for all preparations to be scarce. Moreover, the points and lines that they have seized in China are being harassed by the Chinese guerrillas. Not only can they not be used to develop resources, but they have to spend more money to support the garrison troops. In order to save the collapse of finance, they destroyed the Nine-Power Treaty and seized customs duties in the occupied areas, and excluded the commercial interests of third countries. However, this has caused a boycott movement from Britain and the United States, which has increased their predicament. As for China, the financial situation has always been stable, and the treasures of the inland are being developed. It can be said that the War of Resistance has promoted China's economic progress. Recently, the success of British and American loans has greatly increased China's economic power.</p>
<p>Diplomatically, the people of all democratic countries have always sympathized with and supported China's War of Resistance. The recent active support of the British and American governments and the establishment of loans are a major threat to Japan. His influence has indeed made China's war of resistance stronger, and Japan's aggression has become more tricky. It has also allowed the Soviet Union to dare to take a tougher stance towards Japan to contain the Japanese army. The recent negotiations on the fishing dispute are a clear proof. Therefore, at the beginning of the second phase of the War of Resistance, the united front against Japan and against aggression in the international community has begun. This is a victory for China's offensive diplomacy, and the blow it has given to the enemy, whether materially or spiritually, is very great.</p>
<p>In this second phase of the War of Resistance, we see that the three conditions sufficient to defeat and destroy Japanese imperialism are maturing: China's anti-Japanese united front has been completed and is being strengthened, the international anti-Japanese united front is being conceived, and the Japanese people's revolution is also brewing in secret. In addition, the military advantage gained by the transfer of the battleground and the change of the Chinese army's strategy is the victorious prelude to the large-scale annihilation war to recover lost territory in the third phase!</p>
<p>However, if China is to truly win the final victory, it is also necessary for the people to redouble their efforts subjectively, further strengthen national unity, and persist in fighting the war to the end. And everyone must contribute money and effort to shatter the divisive and provocative, peace-promoting atmosphere that the Japanese side may send out, as well as the deceptive and anesthetizing policies implemented in the occupied areas. Otherwise, if we slacken our efforts even a little, we will miss the favorable conditions that have already been created!</p>
<h3>US Government Announces Strong Note to Japan: Does Not Recognize Breach of Treaty, Creates New Situation; Any Proposals Can Only Be Discussed by a Conference of All Concerned Nations; British Authorities Agree with US Opinion and Have Also Notified Japan</h3>
<p>(Washington) The US response to Japan's declaration of a "New Order in East Asia" has now been published, stating that the United States absolutely cannot recognize any country unilaterally establishing a so-called new order within another country's territory, acting as sovereign, and controlling the destiny of others. The American people and government absolutely cannot recognize any unilateral abandonment of American rights. The US government deeply believes that Japan's various restrictive measures against Americans are not only unfair and unreasonable but also fundamentally violate various international treaties to which the US and Japan are both parties, and to which many other countries are also parties. The note also states that the United States is prepared to discuss the China issue with Japan, but only on the basis of negotiations in which all countries holding treaty rights in China participate jointly. If Japan can make any proposals based on justice, fairness, and regard for the rights and obligations of all parties concerned, and if all relevant parties are free to discuss new aspects together, then the United States is prepared to give appropriate and full consideration. The note then attacks the puppet organizations established by the Japanese military in China, stating that exchange controls, the forced use of counterfeit currency, unauthorized revision of tariffs, and monopolistic market practices are all implemented in the name of puppet organizations, but at the behest of the Japanese government. Furthermore, these so-called authorities treat the interests of foreigners (including Americans) as nothing. The American people and government will never recognize the actions of any puppet organization that unilaterally deprives third countries of their rights, because fundamental principles of international relations, such as equal opportunity, cannot be unilaterally eliminated by one party. Considering the existing facts, Japan's actions, such as establishing a new order in the Far East, have clearly undermined sacred and solemn international treaties. (US Associated Press dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the maintenance of the Open Door Policy in China, the US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, recently submitted a note to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. (Note: After the United States submitted a note to Japan on October 6, Japan submitted a reply on November 18. This US note is a response to Japan's reply.) The note stated in essence that the conduct and activities of American citizens in China have been restricted by the Japanese authorities, and Japan's own interests have thus been placed in a superior position. This is a discriminatory measure and is truly unfair. It should be known that the legal status of all related countries is already stipulated in treaties. If Japan wishes to amend these, it could have achieved its goals through normal procedures of international negotiations. Japan now claims the right to violate treaties with its talk of a "new order, new situation," which is absolutely unacceptable to the US government, as the new reality in China has been created by Japan. The conclusion is that "If Japan can present any proposals to all other related countries, including China, the US government is prepared to discuss them. The venue can be designated jointly by all related countries, and from now until then, the US government will reserve all existing rights, which cannot be changed."</p>
<p>The most important point of this US note is that the legal status of all countries in China can be modified based on proposals made by Japan. US diplomatic circles commented that this is not an indirect proposal to convene an international conference, but rather an attempt to tell Japan that it agreed to conduct negotiations in a difficult situation in 1921, and the Nine-Power Treaty was born. Today, this procedure still needs to be adopted. However, based on the information received here, Japan absolutely does not want to hold an international conference. Therefore, this US note is not so much a new initiative on the Far East issue as it is a reaffirmation of key principles. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government's note to Japan has been commented on by political observers. Although this note does not urge the establishment of a strong alliance by the countries concerned, it does advocate discussing the so-called new order in the Far East through an international conference. The intention seems to be to have other countries, such as Britain and France, adopt the same stance as the United States. The tone of this note is firm, but without intimidation. The US government refuses to recognize the new order created by Japan, but it does not explain how the US will respond if Japan persists in its views. In fact, Japan's actions are similar to Germany's attitude in Eastern and Central Europe. Germany enjoys hegemony east of the Rhine, which has been confirmed by the Munich Agreement. Japan wants to enjoy hegemony in China, and have other countries recognize its so-called "rights." Although Germany and Italy may recognize these "rights," the US government will continue to promote the policy advocated by former Secretary of State Stimson, refusing to recognize accomplished facts. The US government authorities are aware that there are two ways to prevent Japan's attempt to establish hegemony in all of China: (1) China's vast territory will cause Japan major difficulties; (2) The major Western powers can cooperate to provide more active assistance to China and cut off Japan's supplies, which is almost equivalent to economic sanctions, a serious measure that could lead to war. World countries and US public opinion may not easily agree to take this risk. (Havas, 31st) Regarding the preservation of the Nine-Power Treaty, the US government has sent a note to Japan. Local newspapers have commented that the note is firm in tone. The New York Times stated, "US policy toward Japan is based on the theory of non-recognition of accomplished facts. This theory was advocated by former Secretary of State Stimson during the Manchurian Incident and was also applied to the Abyssinian question." The New York World-Telegram stated, "If the world bargains with these people (referring to the Japanese) and makes concessions to them, hoping for a reasonable response, it will only invite contempt and insults. To preserve our dignity, the only negotiation we should have with Japan is a solemn warning, stating that we will wait for an appropriate opportunity to demand compensation for damages." (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(London) According to Reuters diplomatic sources, the United States' recent note to Japan, which clearly refuses to recognize Japan's creation of a new order in China, has attracted great attention in London. The issue of British interests in China has been discussed informally by the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, and the Japanese Foreign Minister, Arita. Therefore, Britain is currently unlikely to send a note to Japan. Although there has been no official criticism of this US note, observers generally believe that Washington's approach and the US's arguments closely match London's views and feelings. Responsible sources in Washington have indicated that this will be the last US note on the China issue. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Soviet Newspaper Comments on Konoe Declaration: Aims to Test the Attitude of Wavering Elements in China; China's Determined Resistance Foils Konoe's Plan</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government's official newspaper, Izvestia, recently commented on the declaration issued by Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe on the 22nd of this month, stating that this declaration is primarily intended to conceal Japan's imperialist annexation plan. Undoubtedly, it also reveals the country's fear of the future of the war. The intention of this move is to test the attitude of wavering elements in China and whether peace is possible. However, after General Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission of China, delivered a speech on the 26th of this month, stating that the country has decided to continue the war of resistance until final victory, this strategy has already failed. Japan's war against China was originally intended to exclude the interests of all countries in China. The Konoe Declaration is also aimed at all countries, brazenly expressing the desire to abolish the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by all countries in China, so that Japan will become the sole master after conquering China. Its request to station troops in China under the pretext of opposing the Comintern is ill-intentioned and inconsistent, and its true nature is already clearly revealed. Perhaps it is because Japan's offensive power has been weakened to this point that the country's warlords are forced to resort to deceptive tactics, saying that they want to reach a mutual "understanding" with China based on the lowest possible conditions, in order to weaken China's anti-Japanese front. The insidious nature of this scheme is evident. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief of Japanese Forces in Central China, Shiroku Hata, Severely Wounded: Shot by Chinese Air Force Near Yueyang; Sent to Nanjing for Treatment, Doihara Visits Him</h3>

<h3>National Government Orders: Reiterate Strict Handling of Traitors; Those Truly Forced Are Allowed to Reform; Those Who Remain Obstinate Will Be Severely Punished According to Law</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The National Government issued a clear order on the 1st to strictly handle traitors. The telegram read: Since the start of the full-scale war of resistance, the military and civilians of the entire country have been united in their hatred of the enemy, taking the nation and the people as their priority, firmly resisting, and determined not to change. However, there are a few deranged individuals who are willing to be used by the enemy, to be servile and to act as accomplices, which is truly hateful. The government has previously ordered the Military Affairs Commission to investigate and arrest those who participated in puppet organizations in various regions, and to punish them severely according to law, and has also promulgated the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, clearly defining the penal provisions for various acts of collusion with the enemy, ordering its implementation to eliminate traitors. Now that the war situation is turning in our favor, the enemy's plots are emerging endlessly. If we do not eliminate and root out such elements, how can we encourage the masses? Therefore, we reiterate the laws and regulations and make them known to all. All those who have participated in illegal organizations in the northern and southern provinces, except for those who were truly forced and are willing to reform and repent, will be allowed to rehabilitate themselves and be exempted from punishment. However, if there are national traitors who are still obstinate, either holding positions in puppet regimes or secretly acting as traitors, daring to defy the world, and being abandoned by all Chinese people, then they are outside the pale and their crimes are unforgivable. The Military Affairs Commission shall be responsible for conducting a thorough investigation, strictly arresting and punishing them in accordance with the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, in order to uphold the law and satisfy the people's hearts. This order. (Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Chairman's Speech (Continued from Yesterday): Delivered at the Chongqing New Life Movement Advancement Association on New Year's Eve</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Our year and a half of resistance war has been able to become more courageous after each setback, unyielding and indomitable. We have been able to continue to persevere and deal with the enemy. The effectiveness of the New Life Movement has undoubtedly had a very important influence. However, some people who do not fully understand the entire content of the New Life Movement often mistakenly believe that the New Life Movement does not have clear instructions for entertainment, thinking that a person's life, if tense all day long without any adjustment, will inevitably be dull and uninteresting, and believing that this is a major shortcoming. Little do they know that the New Life Movement fundamentally does not prohibit proper entertainment, and its so-called artistic meaning inherently includes entertainment. However, this interpretation of entertainment is limited to what is beneficial to the body and mind and beneficial to society, and it seeks to incorporate the role of education and cultivate moral behavior from entertainment. It is naturally absolutely different from the general social entertainment that is dedicated to gambling, wandering, dancing, drinking, and so on. It is important to know that these behaviors are completely degenerate behaviors of indulgence and dissipation, which not only damage the individual's physical and mental health but will also affect the cause of the country and society. For example, if an official is obsessed with prostitution and gambling, he will inevitably neglect his duties, will inevitably be extravagant, waste precious time, and wear down his personal ambitions. Therefore, corruption, incompetence, and various abuses will all arise in connection with each other. Also, if a person is obsessed with prostitution and gambling, he will inevitably abandon production, suffer losses, and even commit crimes and disrupt discipline, becoming a scourge of society. Everyone can understand this principle, but there are many people who deliberately ignore it, indulging and refusing to turn back, and even forcibly try to explain that this is personal private morality, an occasional pastime that does not harm the overall situation. May I ask, how can we call this kind of behavior harmless private entertainment? The words "occasional pastime" are the root cause of bad habits in individuals and bad customs in society. The Book of Rites has a few words: "If likes and dislikes have no moderation within, and knowledge is induced from without, and one cannot reflect on oneself, then the principles of Heaven are destroyed. If the principles of Heaven are destroyed and human desires are exhausted, then there will be rebellious feelings and licentious acts of disorder. This is the way to great chaos." The current kind of bad entertainment is precisely the origin of destroying the principles of Heaven, exhausting human desires, and not being able to reflect on oneself. The invasion of our national culture is due to our people mistakenly regarding this kind of degenerate behavior as entertainment life, so that they indulge in depravity and do whatever they want. Is this not one of the root causes of our illness? Moreover, to take a step back, these entertainments, apart from being confused and chaotic and losing reason at the time, will inevitably cause mental pain and unbearable remorse once things change. There is no slightest pleasure and it is fundamentally contrary to the original meaning of happiness. Therefore, in the New Life Movement, these behaviors are identified as not entertainment, not personal private morality, and must be fundamentally eradicated and cleared away. I have recently issued an order to party, government, military, and public servants, banning it strictly. We want national rejuvenation. On the one hand, we must thoroughly implement the prohibition of opium; at the same time, we must thoroughly eliminate the evil habit of gambling. We sincerely hope that comrades and compatriots across the country will unite in reflection, self-awareness and others, and self-encouragement and encouragement of others, and jointly shoulder the responsibility of changing customs. Our nation has hope for continued revival. Comrades in Chongqing are particularly encouraged because their examples are emulated by the entire country, to do excellent job and be a model for all parts of the country. But that being said, what exactly is the entertainment of the New Life Movement? It should be known that the essence of entertainment, the essential condition, is that after doing it, it can regulate the fatigue of our day's work, promote our positive spirit, and create a happy mind. Confucius once said a phrase, "Play in the arts." Although the meaning is simple, it is the most reasonable entertainment life. This word "art" refers to the six things that the ancients called the great arts: rites, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and arithmetic. The ancients used this to educate the people, and at the same time, they used it as people's entertainment life. You see how meaningful this entertainment method of our ancestors is! Therefore, in the conclusion of the New Life Movement Outline, there are two sentences: "The six arts of ancient China: rites, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and arithmetic are now precisely the main arts for building a nation in the Eastern and Western powers." It can be seen that the entertainment that the New Life Movement wants to promote has long been proposed. Just talking about music, the music that anyone can do is now music radio, gramophone, collective singing meetings, and various concerts. As long as the content is proper, it is enough to cultivate the body and mind. Archery and horsemanship are equivalent to various sports now. Young people can participate in various ball games, races, skating, and swimming. Older people can also practice various gymnastics and national arts. As for travel and picnics, they can also be held appropriately. Writing and arithmetic are naturally academic research, and there is no difference between ancient and modern times. Things like chess, calligraphy, and painting are naturally also within the scope of writing and arithmetic entertainment. And the modern and foreign books are enough to cultivate the temperament, increase knowledge, and the benefits are endless. You can choose what you like and you can always gather colleagues or friends to read, study, exchange ideas, and discuss with each other to increase mutual interest. These entertainment methods can be held anytime, anywhere by individuals and families, either to please the eyes and ears, strengthen the body, or increase knowledge. At the time, it is of course physically and mentally pleasant, and afterwards, it can cultivate the foundation of a career. There are a hundred benefits and no harm. Why don't we do it? There is a most popular saying in society now, "Entertainment does not forget to save the country." It must be this kind of entertainment to be considered not contrary to the true meaning of saving the country. Our current national unanimous hope is concentrated on the two goals of winning the war of resistance and building the country. However, our current situation is still very dangerous. The great disaster of national subjugation and extinction is still pressing on our eyes. To break through this disaster, crush the enemy's oppression, and complete the mission of resisting the war and building the country, in addition to our 450 million compatriots across the country being of one heart and one mind, strengthening human and material resources through a difficult and arduous life, there is no other way. We must be consistent across the country, to achieve a state of no useless people, no wasted time, no wasted land, no wasted materials, so that we can fully strengthen human and material resources to compare with the enemy, to have hope for long-term control of the enemy and strive for final victory. At the same time, we must also know that after our victory in the war of resistance, the country will have undergone an unprecedented destruction after this great calamity, and all civil construction will have been destroyed as never before. At that time, the difficulties will inevitably be more serious than during the war. We should make up our minds early and be particularly frugal so that the future construction of the country can be successful. Therefore, our entertainment must recognize this serious meaning, not only to resolutely reject the entertainment that consumes time, energy, and materials, but also to actively pay attention to all proper entertainment for men, women, old, and young, on the one hand to inspire everyone's spirit, but also to increase the total power of creation and production, and must make it closely related to the future of the war of resistance and national construction, and must not allow any wasteful influence. Tomorrow is the New Year's Day of the 28th year, I warmly hope that our compatriots will cheer up, innovate their lives, and make all past bad habits fundamentally erased with this year's New Year's Eve, and a neat, lively, active, and forward-looking rational life will flourish from tomorrow's New Year's Day, achieving the consolidation of the national foundation and the enrichment of people's lives through changing customs, realizing the Three Principles of the People and completing the National Revolution. I take this opportunity to wish the comrades present and the compatriots across the country a happy new year. (Dispatch, 31st)</p>

<h3>The Degree of Cooperation Between Britain and the United States is Astonishing</h3>

<h3>Weather Forecast for 1939: The Far East and the Mediterranean Still the Two Major World Problems, Central European Problem Already Resolved by Germany, German and Italian Newspapers Use Alarming Language Again</h3>
<p>(Berlin) On New Year's Eve, German newspapers commented on the strength of the German military and the confusion of Britain. The Berlin Borsen Zeitung published a threatening article, stating that by the end of 1939, the Central European problem had been resolved according to German methods. Germany has occupied an initiating position in world politics. Britain values the friendship of world Jews more than the friendship of Germany, which is very regrettable. The colonial issue could have been resolved through British-German compromise, but it was shelved due to pro-Jewish sentiments. The eight or ninety million people of Germany now stand at the entrance of a great future, and are the largest group among the white race. The Mediterranean and the Far East are still the two major problems in world politics in the new year. Domination of the Mediterranean will undoubtedly be a major event in 1939. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian Popolo d'Italia recently stated that recognizing the dominance of the German-Italian axis in Central and Eastern Europe, and at the same time recognizing its dominance in the Mediterranean, is one of the conditions for maintaining European peace. "At this point, the future of Europe depends on the actions of the German-Italian axis and the resistance of other countries. This situation is more certain than in the past. The future development of the situation will take one of two paths: Resistance will eventually turn into understanding. If so, we can use peaceful means to transform the current situation in Central Europe and the Mediterranean, with Germany and Italy taking the dominant position. If this resistance is unreasonable, then the future of Europe will definitely face extremely serious difficulties." (1st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The entire diplomatic corps paid a New Year's visit to President Lebrun this morning. The Papal Nuncio, Archbishop Valerio Valeri, as the leader of the diplomatic corps, delivered a speech, briefly stating that 1938 was extremely important in history. "At one point, the catastrophe of war was about to descend. Fortunately, people of noble will cooperated and rescued us, preventing the bankruptcy of our millennia-old culture, and preserving the glory and beauty of the continent we inhabit. As we bid farewell to the old and welcome the new, we deeply hope that peace will continue to be maintained in the coming year, and that all countries can move forward on the path of understanding and cooperation." As for France, it has made many efforts for the ideals of justice and peace, which is admirable. President Lebrun immediately replied, "I hope that in the coming year, all places where peace can be preserved will remain peaceful, and that other places that have suffered the devastation of war for several months will also be able to restore peace." France will work enthusiastically for the rapprochement of all nations, and deeply hopes that all governments will also show the same sincerity. (31st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Budapest) Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky is scheduled to publish a New Year's message in the semi-official Hungarian newspaper, Pester Lloyd, tomorrow. He said, "We have a full understanding of the signs of the times, and we know that to maintain confidence, we must constantly issue public statements. Everyone knows the meaning of the Anti-Comintern Pact very well. We also felt the decline of the League of Nations more than a decade ago. World public opinion is now divided into two camps centered on two different ideologies. No one can support both ideologies with the same confidence. This is also something we deeply understand." In terms of diplomacy, we acknowledge Germany's rights in Central Europe. Our friendship with Poland has a solid foundation, and our long-standing friendship with Yugoslavia was further strengthened during the tense situation in September this year. As for our two neighboring countries, Romania and Czechoslovakia, the evolution of our relations with them will depend on the treatment of the Hungarian minorities within their borders. Our rapprochement with Germany and Italy is not intended to oppose the major powers of Western Europe. "All veterans oppose a new war. This is undoubtedly true." Some quarters have commented on the Foreign Minister's article, generally asking whether Hungary is preparing to withdraw from the League of Nations. (31st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Barcelona) Republican Prime Minister Negrín took the opportunity of New Year's Day to deliver a radio speech to all countries in the world, especially the countries of South America, briefly stating that the civil war that has occurred within Spain is related to the future of all countries. Its significance lies in proving whether countries will be governed by violence or international law in the future, and whether the world will be controlled by omnipotent countries or democratic countries. It is still possible to reverse the situation, but the crisis is widespread and cannot be delayed any longer. At this point, countries can face each other in battle without declaring war. In the case of Spain, although the civil war was initially caused by a military rebellion, in reality there was an attempt by Germany and Italy to expand their influence. These acts of aggression have caused us great suffering, but the ignorance of right and wrong on the part of our friendly and neutral countries has been even more harmful. The enemy will use this situation to slander us. They falsely accuse us of being influenced by the Bolsheviks. In fact, on the day the civil war broke out in our country in July 1936, Spain was the only country in Europe that had not established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The claim of being influenced by them can be refuted without argument. In short, although we have suffered greatly, we are still fully confident that we will achieve a final victory for the independence of our country, the freedom of mankind, and the principles of democracy."

<h3>Daladier Goes to Dependencies, Declares No Surrender of an Inch of Land</h3>

The Prime Minister was originally scheduled to depart this morning with Navy Minister Campinchi, Army Chief of Staff General Georges, and Air Force Chief of Staff General Vuillemin. However, due to the debate in the Chamber of Deputies on the 1939 budget, the Prime Minister had to attend in person, thus delaying the trip. The train is expected to arrive at Toulon at 10:15 p.m., and then board the cruiser "Foch" at 11:00 p.m. to go to the capital of Corsica. (1st Havas dispatch)</p>

When inspecting Corsica and the Tunisian Protectorate in North Africa in the coming days, he will also deliver a speech explaining France's firm policy. According to Foreign Minister Bonnet, who stated in a speech to the Chamber of Deputies on the 19th of this month, "France will never cede an inch of land to Italy. Any attempt to seize French territory will definitely lead to war. The Tunisian Protectorate, Corsica, Savoy, and French Somaliland in East Africa are all French territories without distinction."

<h3>Spain: Intense Fighting, Conflicting News from Both Sides</h3>
<p>Barcelona: Last night, the Spanish Republican Army's war report stated that the Nationalist Army, advancing along Seros, was exerting strong pressure and continuing to advance. The fighting in and around Seras was particularly fierce. The Nationalist Army received assistance from aircraft, artillery, and tanks. The Republican Army could only resist bravely. In Corcubión, they repelled two attacks by strong enemies. After heavy casualties, the Nationalist Army captured Hill 429. The Republican Army immediately launched a counterattack and recaptured the hill. The attacking enemy forces at other locations also suffered heavy casualties. Republican aircraft dropped bombs on enemy concentration areas, which were quite accurate. One enemy plane was shot down. On the 30th night, Republican fighter planes shot down attacking enemy planes over the coastal city of Southern Catalonia, with no survivors among the four on board. Yesterday morning, enemy planes bombed the port of Valencia, and Barcelona was subjected to four air raids yesterday. (1st Reuter dispatch)</p>
<p>Salamanca: The headquarters of the Spanish Nationalist Army declared that Barcelona's report that the Republican Army's counterattack south of Lérida was quite successful did not correspond to the facts. In fact, the Republican Army on the Catalan front was only retreating, not counterattacking. The Nationalist Army advanced with amazing speed, and the Republican Army in Cervera was caught off guard and could only surrender. (1st Reuter dispatch)</p>
<p>Barcelona: Yesterday, as Nationalist planes were flying overhead and anti-aircraft guns were firing below, a detachment of the Spanish Presidential Guard protected the newly appointed French Ambassador to Barcelona, Henri, to attend an official banquet.

<h3>Current State of British and German Navies: Germany Builds Small Submarines, Power Exceeds Britain's by Double</h3>
<p>(London) The Times naval correspondent wrote an article on the British-German naval talks, saying that one situation is particularly noteworthy, that is, if Germany builds small submarines, its submarine power may exceed Britain's by more than double. The number of German submarines is currently greater than that of Britain, with 72 compared to 69. However, their tonnage is only 45% of that of British submarines, because German submarines are purely for coastal use and are all small. British submarines need to go to any part of the world, so larger ones are more suitable. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The British-German naval talks have ended yesterday. It is said that Germany will build submarines as amazing as those during the Great War. According to observers, Germany will build 130 new submarines. During the Great War, Germany had a total of 140 submarines. (1st AP dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, regarding Germany's request to build submarines of the same tonnage as Britain, although no official news is available here after the British and German representatives met in Berlin, it seems that there is no reason to speculate that Germany will change its intentions. Vice Admiral Cunningham, the leader of the British delegation to Germany, returned to London by plane yesterday and will prepare a report on the Berlin talks and submit it to the British Foreign Office. It is reported that this report will be sent to Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax, who are currently on vacation in Nairnshire. It is heard that the British government questioned Germany's reasons for wanting to build more submarines during the meeting. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding Germany's request, based on the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement, to increase its submarine tonnage to be equal to that of British submarines, after the British Admiralty delegation went to Berlin to hold talks with German naval representatives, well-informed sources here recently declared that the British delegation's trip failed to persuade Germany to change its original intention. However, based on unconfirmed news, it is possible that the country has made concessions in terms of construction deadlines and styles. In addition, the German government, in accordance with the guarantee clauses contained in the 1937 Anglo-German Naval Agreement, requested to increase the number of 10,000-ton cruisers (with 8-inch guns) allowed to be built from five to seven. This request was made on the pretext that the Soviet government had added first-class cruisers, but failed to provide concrete evidence. According to the 1936 Anglo-French-American naval treaty, it is not allowed to build 10,000-ton cruisers. However, because certain countries have already built many such cruisers, other countries are allowed to build them in moderation. For example, Germany and the Soviet Union can each build five. (31st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After the German government submitted a note to Britain on the 19th of this month, advocating that the tonnage of German submarines be increased to be equal to that of British submarines in accordance with the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of June 18, 1935, the British government immediately dispatched a naval delegation led by Vice Admiral Cunningham to come here for consultations. The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating, "After the British Admiralty delegation arrived here on the 29th of this month, it held talks with German naval representatives yesterday in a very friendly spirit. The two sides explained their views separately on various issues arising from the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement (regarding quantitative restrictions) and the 1937 Anglo-German Naval Agreement (regarding qualitative restrictions). The German government will then submit a written note to the British government based on the results of this talk. The British Admiralty delegation returned to London today." According to well-informed sources, in addition to expressing its desire to increase the tonnage of submarines to be equal to that of British submarines, the German representative brought up the issue of the caliber of the guns on first-class cruisers for discussion. As for the strength of Germany's existing submarine fleet, according to the Naval Yearbook, from 1935 to 1937, the various classes of submarines that have been launched include ten of 5,000 tons, two of 712 tons, and twenty-four of 250 tons. Those currently under construction include six of 250 tons, eleven of 547 tons, and eight of 740 tons. (31st Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Orders: Fixed Domestic Silver Price, 64.6 Cents Per Ounce; Foreign Silver Price to Be Determined at Any Time</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt ordered today that the Treasury Department will continue to purchase newly mined silver at a price of 64.64 cents per ounce for the next six months. This is the method recommended by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. At the same time, the silver group in Congress is also opposed to lowering the price of silver and intends to introduce a new bill in Congress within six months. As for the purchase of silver from abroad, the current market price of 43 cents per ounce will still be maintained. (31st AP dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt issued an order today stipulating that the government can still purchase domestically produced silver at a price of 64 cents per ounce until June 30, 1939. The actual price of American silver is slightly more than $1.28 per ounce. The amount of silver in storage as of November 30, 1938, was 2,524,000,000 ounces, worth a total of $3,236,000,000. The method of purchasing silver from foreign countries was not specified and will be determined at any time by the financial authorities 24 hours in advance. Regarding monetary and financial issues, Congress granted President Roosevelt special powers in 1933, allowing him to devalue the dollar to a certain extent and establish an exchange equalization fund. This power is scheduled to expire on June 30, 1939. (31st Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Syria Warns France: Must Allow Independence; Syrian Prime Minister Expresses Firm Stance; All Members of Parliament Express Approval</h3>
<p>Damascus: The treaty signed between France and the Syrian Republic on September 9, 1936, stipulated that France should relinquish its rule and allow Syria to become an independent country after three years. Since the Foreign Affairs Committees of the French Senate and Chamber of Deputies refused to ratify this treaty, the Chamber of Deputies of the Syrian Republic discussed it this afternoon. Shukri al-Quwatli, the leader of the Nationalist Party, immediately demanded that the Syrian government immediately announce that the transitional period stipulated in the French-Syrian treaty had expired, and that it would reclaim its political power and declare independence. Prime Minister Mardam followed with a speech, saying that the treaty had been rejected by France. There is nothing to report in detail about my trip to France. This approach of the French government is quite inappropriate. I warned the authorities of the French Foreign Ministry that if this treaty is not ratified, serious consequences will follow. The French government will then send another investigation team to Syria. At that time, the Chamber of Deputies and the government will not be willing to negotiate with them. "It is true that Syria must maintain friendship with France. However, if France breaks its promise, we will use all means to defend ourselves, even sacrificing our lives and property to seek independence." The Chamber of Deputies then unanimously passed a motion expressing its approval of the policies pursued by Mardam. The discussion was very heated. (31st Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Technician Convicted by Russian Authorities: Flying into the Country Without a License</h3>
<p>(Moscow) After the Moscow Civil Court opened a trial the other day on the case of British technician Galloway, who flew into Soviet territory without the permission of the Soviet authorities, it was announced today that the defendant Galloway was convicted of sneaking into the country and fined 1,500 rubles. If he is unable to pay, he will be sentenced to one month of detention and his plane will be confiscated. Galloway had worked in a Soviet oil mine for many years and married a Soviet woman. Since he left alone in 1934, he has been eager to return to the Soviet Union to visit his wife, but he was unable to obtain a permit at the Soviet Consulate. Therefore, he bought a single-engine plane in the Swedish capital and flew through the capital of Finland, landing in Leningrad, Soviet Union, on the 13th of last month. Local police immediately arrested him because he did not have an entry permit. He was then brought here. The Soviet judicial authorities, on the grounds that Galloway sneaked into the country, should have been severely punished in accordance with the law under the charges of "espionage" or "counter-revolutionary activities." In view of his true motive, which is the love of his family, and there is no other intention, the sentence has been mitigated. (31st Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>This Year's Guizhou Province's Policy Guidelines Under the Leadership and Supervision of the Central Government, the War of Resistance and National Construction Proceed Simultaneously</h3>
<p>Guiyang. Guizhou Province is the center of the rear area of the War of Resistance and the hub of the southwestern provinces. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, a province with a shortage of financial resources has been burdened with arduous tasks. Fortunately, thanks to the efforts of the authorities in the past year, both politics and construction have made considerable progress. As the end of the year is approaching, a reporter specially visited Chairman Wu Dingchang to inquire about the work and policy guidelines for the year. Mr. Wu first humbly declined and then made the following statement: Since I came to Guizhou for a year, I have no significant performance to report and feel very guilty. Fortunately, with the guidance, support, and efforts of all sectors, various facilities have gradually been established. In terms of politics, the training of Baojia cadres has been completed and is being carried out for compilation and investigation, and more than ten cases of punishing corruption have been handled, banditry cleared up, and the ban on opium planting and smoking since the 26th year has been strictly enforced. Important political affairs such as conscription and corvée labor have also been completed on schedule. In terms of education, in addition to strictly militarizing it, popular education will be given priority to the public. Official governance is gradually entering a clear track. In terms of construction, cotton trials and silkworm improvements have been quite successful in agriculture. The plan to replace opium cultivation with wheat and rapeseed has also been implemented. The plan to afforest one million mu of land every year has also been put into practice. The number of county cooperative treasuries that have been decided to be established has reached more than thirty counties, and the rest are being planned. The provincial cooperative treasury will also be held soon. The rural financial institutions in the province have been completed, and production will surely increase year by year. This province has had good harvests in various places this year, and has legally handled the storage to make up for the amount that should have been stored in the 25th and 26th years. Provincial granaries have been established in five counties including Guiyang, and regulating offices have been established in nine counties including Qianxi. In addition, the Farmland Irrigation Loan Committee and the Agricultural Production Loan Committee are tasked with subsidizing people's production. As for transportation and sales, there are also special committees such as the Industry and Commerce Adjustment Committee and the Tung Oil Transportation and Sales Cooperative Committee to take charge of it, and actively transport and sell local special products to supplement national income. In total, 3.8 million yuan has been allocated for agricultural funds, and this will increase every year in the future. The development of agriculture should not be a problem. In terms of mining, coal mines and other mines have already raised sufficient funds and established companies, bureaus and offices to actively develop them. Cement plants are being planned. In terms of industry, in addition to local handicrafts, oil factories have been established, and flour factories, food factories, sugar factories, and the manufacture of chemical daily necessities are all being planned. In terms of transportation, it is urgently needed to be developed. In addition to the five major trunk roads in this province, ten trunk roads will be built one after another: (1) Sichuan-Yunnan Highway, Chiwei Section; (2) Xingjiang Highway from Xingren and Xingyi to Kunming; (3) Andu Highway (from Anmen via Baise, Guangxi to Longzhou); (4) Yusong Highway (from Yuping to Songtao); (5) Dingluo Highway (from Dingbian to Luodian Hongshui River); (6) Dusan Highway (from Duyun via Sanyue to Rongjiang); (7) Zunping Highway (from Zunyi to Pingyue Tongmachangping); (8) Zunsong Highway (from Zunyi via Sinan to Songtao); (9) Suirong Highway (from Sansui to Rongjiang); (10) Tongchi Highway (from Tongzi to Chishui or to Hejiang, Sichuan). In terms of railways, the Weizhu section is connected to the Sichuan-Yunnan trunk line, and the Ministry of Transportation has agreed to hold it first. The waterways are currently being surveyed and dredged by personnel sent by the central government. As for health construction, no less than 20 health institutes have been established, and epidemic prevention work has also been universally implemented. The rapid eradication of cholera this year has shown results. After Guangzhou and Wuhan successively retreated, the leader's letter to the people of the country clearly showed the people of the country that "the southwestern provinces will be the source of our War of Resistance." Therefore, in the future, under the leadership and supervision of the central government, the War of Resistance and national construction will proceed simultaneously. In the 28th year, because of expelling the enemy and recovering the lost land, the work is even more urgent, and the supply of manpower and materials is more important to the overall situation. This province is poor, and the material contributions are less than in other provinces. In the future, we should only make up for the lack of material resources with human resources. Therefore, we have decided to take "the first priority of military service in this year's work" as the slogan to handle military service with all our strength. Moreover, in order to ensure that the conscription is not lacking and not missed, Baojia must be sound, transportation must be convenient, soldiers must be strong, health administration must be universally promoted, and opium must be completely banned. Raising national awareness is an important part of military training. The way to improve shortcomings and cut out malpractices is to rectify the governance of the province, clear out remote bandits, and develop local resources. This is the outline of the policy guidelines for the 28th year of this province, which should be worked hard to carry out. (30th telegram)</p>
<h3>Huang Xuchu Published the Administration of Guangxi in the Past Year, Adhering to the Principle of Resistance and Construction, Striving to Achieve Anything Conducive to the Resistance</h3>
<p>Guilin. Huang Xuchu published the administration of Guangxi in the past year, with more than 10,000 words. First, he stated that in the past year of the 27th year, this province has always adhered to the principle of resisting the war on the one hand and building on the other hand during this extraordinary period, bravely forging ahead, and concentrating all efforts and sacrificing everything to achieve anything that can enhance the strength of the war of resistance and meet the needs of the war of resistance, hoping to make up for the country. Although it is in the period of resistance, political expenses are stretched, but various regular political affairs and important constructions are still carried out step by step and in an orderly manner, without being stagnated due to the resistance. The progress of various constructions in the past year is unprecedented in any previous year. The reason why it can achieve such satisfactory results is partly due to the financial assistance of the central government and the cooperation of technical agencies, and partly due to the efforts of various experts and financial circles from outside. Secondly, a detailed explanation is given on personnel, administration, organization, local autonomy, local public security, health administration, rural political affairs, finance, accounting, auditing, agriculture, industry and commerce, mining, transportation, higher education, secondary education, national basic education, social education, and relief undertakings in the past year. Finally, statistics show that the province has been bombed more than 40 times in the past year. The bombed areas include Guilin, Cangwu, Liujiang, Guiping, Yongning, Wuming, Longjin, Baibao Huaiji, Hexian, Pingle, Yulin, Quanxian, Zhaoping and other 14 counties. Guilin and Cangwu counties were the worst bombed. The victims have been given relief in accordance with the regulations. It is expected that the enemy planes will attack this province more fiercely than in the past. However, the enemy planes can only destroy our property, but cannot eliminate our will to resist the war. On the contrary, their madness in bombing will make our people recognize the cruel face of the Communist Party and strengthen their determination to sacrifice and resist the war. Therefore, we are absolutely not afraid of their bombing, and we are always prepared for their bombing. However, our will will become stronger and stronger, and our determination to resist the war will become more and more firm. The enemy's use of such despicable means is only to show off their brutality and strengthen our resistance. Now, on the occasion of the New Year's Day, which coincides with the beginning of the second phase of the War of Resistance, the enemy has already devoted its forces to attack our southwest. In the future, the position of this province will become more and more important militarily, and the tasks we shoulder will be even more difficult. On this day of serious national crisis, it is the time for us to sacrifice for the country. In the future, we should work harder, endure hardship, concentrate the manpower and financial resources of the province, and contribute to the country and the nation. With the greatest sacrifice, we will strive for the final victory. This is what we should work together with our fellow countrymen in the province. All sectors of the Party, government, military and police in Guangxi and various people's organizations will hold a New Year's Day military parade and group worship ceremony one day, and extensively comfort the wounded soldiers. The authorities have allocated 50,000 Gui coins to the consolation group to distribute to various counties. (1st telegram)</p>

<h3>The Yellow River Breach Has Not Been Blocked, and the Disaster Situation in Nine Counties in Northern Jiangsu Has Been Formed. Public and Private Groups Re-Telegram the Central Government for Help. The Provincial Government Hired Han Guojun to Form an Estuary Engineering Committee</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence. The counties in the lower reaches of Jiangsu Province have been flooded by the Yellow River, which has seized the Huai River and flowed south, passing through Hongze, Gaobao, and Zhu Lakes, breaking through the eastern embankment of the Grand Canal, and flooding the nine counties of Gaoyou, Xinghua, Taixian, Yancheng, Dongtai, Funing, Huaian, Baoying, and Jiangdu, entering the sea. The fertile land of the east of the Grand Canal has suddenly become a country of swamps. After the frost, the Yellow River has continued to rise again and again. Without waiting for next spring, the lowest counties will continue to stage the tragedy of the water flooding Sizhou. Public and private groups in various counties have telegraphed the central government and the provincial government to appeal for help and try to salvage the situation. The latest situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Planning of the Estuary Waterway Engineering Project</p>
<p>The southward breach of the Yellow River extends to several provinces, with eastern Henan and northern Anhui bearing the brunt, and northern Jiangsu being the last. To save this situation, we must first block the two breaches of Huayuankou and Zhaokou to restore the Yellow River to its original course. This is the best policy. Consolidate the Honghu Dam, block and build the Sanhe Caoba and the two dams of Chexin on the Grand Canal, and deepen the Zhangfu Diversion River to force the water to wash the Zhongshan River (ie, the new river of the Guai River) into the sea through the Yangzhuang Activity Dam. This is the middle policy. If the upper and middle policies are not implemented, only the shallow waters downstream of the ports entering the sea will be dredged to increase the drainage capacity, and the continued rise of the Yellow River next spring will not be asked. This is the lower policy. However, the central government must design and construct the blockage of the Yellow River breach. The Sanhe Caoba has a mouth of 800 zhang (Chinese feet), and it is not easy to block. The two dams of Chexin must also wait until the water level drops to within one zhang before construction can be carried out. The only project that can be implemented at present is the ports entering the sea. According to the investigation, the six ports entering the sea (1) Sheyang Port in the east of Funing County, (2) Xinyang Port in the east of Yancheng County, (3) Doulong Port, (4) Wangjia Port, (5) Zhu Port, (6) Dongchuan Port (the above four ports belong to Dongtai) are mostly silted and have many bends, so the drainage is not smooth. The reporter once traveled to the lower reaches of Sheyang Port. The land journey is only six li apart, but the water journey is more than thirty li. Its winding can be known. As far as dredging the ports entering the sea is concerned, there are several things that should be constructed: (1) To the south of Sheyang Port, there is Huangsha Port, which was initiated and built by Ma Yuren. The completed section is more than 70 li long, indirectly connecting to Sheyang Port. Extending it by another 20 li can enter the sea independently. (2) The Xinyang Port dredging project. (3) To the east of Wuyou Port, there is the Xicao River that can lead to the sea, which needs to be opened and dredged. (4) The second Mao You River needs to be extended eastward to connect Wangjia Port and enter the sea. (5) The mouths of Doulong Port, Wangjia Port, Zhu Port, and Dongchuan Port have been building sluice gates since the 20th year of the Republic of China, which can be opened and closed freely. They were originally built to drain freshwater and prevent tidal brine. Each gate has nine holes, each hole is about 2.65 feet. The project cost about 300,000 yuan for each. However, due to poor management and insufficient gate maintenance costs, they have gradually lost their effectiveness in less than ten years. The gate is rusted in the water and cannot be raised. The gate holes on both sides of the gate below Ming (Doulong Port) are particularly bad and must be repaired. Chuanzhen River runs through the north and south, and is a major canal in eastern Jiangsu. Its east is the famous Fan Gong Dam, which used to prevent sea tides, but now it hinders the water from flowing east. More culverts should be opened to facilitate drainage. According to experts, this project requires at least one million yuan to be held.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government Organized an Estuary Engineering Committee</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government recently telegraphed Han Guojun to organize an Estuary Engineering Committee. The telegram read (omitted above) Investigation this year's festival is approaching heavy snow, lake and river water does not disappear, fertile fields are still in swamp, wheat has already been hopeless, if there is another error in spring plowing, then how will the people live, have telegraphed the central government to quickly seek a way to block the mouth, and ordered the Transportation Engineering Bureau to vigorously seek a way to return to the Yangtze River, now intend to organize the Lixiahe Estuary Waterway Engineering Committee, and hire Mr. Wu Xiafeng, Director Shen Baozhen, as deputy directors, respectfully invite you to serve as the director, in addition to sending separate telegrams, corresponding telegrams reached, immediately hope to find a location together, organize the establishment, plan and proceed, so as to early 淡沉 the disaster, is what is expected, and hope to reply the handling situation by telegram, Acting Chairman Han Deqin Yang Jianyin,</p>
<p>Gentry from Various Counties Re-Telegrammed the Central Government for Help</p>
<p>After receiving the telegram, Han Guojun regarded the organization of the Estuary Engineering Committee as important and replied in a telegram hoping to establish and construct early. However, in the telegram of resigning from the position of director, there were words such as "Jun is in declining health and the position of director is really difficult to overcome this complexity." However, the provincial government believes that Han hosted the canal embankment restoration project during the 20th year of the flood, and the achievements were remarkable. Han is the only one who can be the director. Another telegram urged him to take office. On December 17th, Han invited Wu Tongju, Shen Baozhen, Wang Yuanyi, Wang Youshan, Hu Xianbo, Bao Mingshu, etc., to exchange opinions at the Han residence in Hai'an. For the overall engineering, a brief study was conducted, thinking that the waterway into the sea is only a lower policy to reduce the Yellow River disaster. Tracing back to the root, it is still necessary to block the Yellow River breach in the upper reaches. Special telegrams were sent to the central government and to fellow villagers in Sichuan, Huang Renzhi, Leng Yuqiu, Jiang Wenyu, and the former Jiangsu Provincial authorities, Chen Guofu, Niu Tisheng, Ye Chucang, Yu Jingtang, etc., requesting the government to quickly plan to block the breach. The telegrams were roughly the same. Here is a copy of the telegram sent to Huang, Leng and Jiang: (omitted above) Recently, a telegram was sent to the National Government and the Executive Yuan saying, "Since the Yellow River breached from Huayuankou and Zhaokou, it has seized the Huai River and entered Jiangsu. Its water goes straight to Hongze, east irrigates Gaobao, and then passes through the Grand Canal to the east, injecting into the lower reaches of the river. The source is extremely strong and the drainage is not timely. The nine counties of Huaiyang have suddenly become a country of swamps, with a water area of tens of thousands of square miles, and the water depth on the flat ground is several feet. Since the frost, the water has spread and not only does not recede, but also increases. This has never happened before. If the winter is like this, what can we imagine if there are three floods next year? The ports returning to the sea were originally the outlet of the Huai River, but now they are combined with the water of the Yellow River of thousands of miles, which is difficult to bear. In addition, the sea tide is supporting the top, and the amount of discharge is less and less. According to this situation, the wheat has been delayed, and rice will be hopeless. The fundamental plan is to cut off the source of water, which is not enough to stop the catastrophe and 淡沉 the disaster. Please send a senior official to quickly plan to block the breach. Because of the situation at that time, there may be obstacles. Please also refer to the previous telegram and ask the International Engineering Corps to borrow chopsticks to plan and start construction as soon as possible to comfort the people of northern Jiangsu. Urgent telegrams are waiting for orders, etc. Previously, Mr. Zheng Boquan was not telegraphed, and no reply has been received yet. Please call 一致 to save northern Jiangsu, and hope to reply by telegram, Han Guojun, Wang Baohuai, Ma Shijie, Xia Yinguan, Shi Mingyong, Chen Bomeng, Zhang Yanshou, Bao Youke, Bao Sui, Tian Yufan bowed.</p>
<h3>The Focus of the Guangdong War Remains on the West River: Japanese Troops Actively Reinforcing the West River; Chinese Troops on the East River Open the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Line; The Impetus of Japanese Naval Vessels on the Southern Route Subsides</h3>
<p>A telegram from Zhaoqing: The Japanese troops on the West River have been actively carrying out their plan to covet Cangwu. From the 14th, Japanese troops stationed in Guangzhou have been continuously dispatched to Hekou as reinforcements. On the evening of the 15th, two Japanese military vehicles departed from Shiwetang, carrying four to five hundred soldiers and twenty artillery pieces, arriving in Hekou in the early morning of the 16th. On the same day, over two thousand Japanese soldiers also arrived. It is estimated that in the past few days, several thousand troops have been added, stationed in Makou, Mafang, and other locations. At the same time, Japanese troops between Foshan and Jiujiang have also been increasing, apparently redeploying on both the north and south banks of the West River. The focus of future battles will likely remain in the West River area. After the Japanese troops on the Yuehan Railway line were severely defeated by the Chinese army, it was difficult to advance north along the railway. Therefore, they changed their strategy to defend the north and attack the west, using Conghua, Sanshui, and Jiujiang as three important strongholds: (1) From Conghua, they attempted to attack Juntian westward and seize Yinzhanao; (2) From Sanshui, they concentrated their main force to attack Zhaoqing, but because the Chinese side had already stationed heavy troops upstream and was defended in conjunction with the river defense fleet, and the Lingyang Gorge and Zhaoqing Gorge near Zhaoqing were strategically important and the water flow was rapid in this cold winter, which was more conducive to defense, the Japanese army avoided the main points and chose to advance along the Xiaobei River to occupy Lubao, attacking Zhaoqing from the rear, and divided their troops into two routes: one crossed Guanyao and advanced towards Juntian, in order to establish close contact with the Japanese troops in northern Guangdong, and at the same time actively engaged in attacking the guerrillas scattered in the triangular area between Juntian, Lubao, and Sanshui, in order to wait for an opportunity to attack, and also to launch attacks from Lubao to cut off the Chinese army's military communication between Qingyuan and Sihui; the other went south along the south bank of the river from Dongmakou to reach the border of Gaoyao County; (3) The Japanese troops in Jiujiang attacked Heshan, suppressing the guerrillas in that area. Their main purpose was to advance westward along Gulao and Sanzhou, employing a roundabout strategy with the Japanese troops going south from Dongmakou to jointly attack Zhaoqing, and then attack Wu to enter Guangxi. This is the general situation of the Japanese army's invasion of the West River.</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese army, realizing that the Chinese army has transferred strong forces to defend key points and that it is not easy to succeed, has changed its strategy to defensive. Therefore, they have been rushing to build defensive works in Makou, Hekou, Sigong, Jiaokou, Dalu Market, and other places, and have erected several small steel cannons at Mumian Gang and Maoer Gang near Mafang to prevent Chinese counterattacks. In the past few days, they have been bombarding the east side frequently with small steel cannons, attempting to prevent the Chinese army from crossing the river. On the 16th, from morning to night, they bombarded the Chinese army across the river at Makou. From the 18th to the 21st, they bombarded the Chinese army positions in Jinli all day long. The Chinese troops in both places calmly responded and repeatedly fired back. At the same time, Japanese aircraft also flew upstream along the West River for days, carrying out large-scale bombing. It is reported that Yongan, Guangli, Jinli, Beishui, Lubu, Xinqiao, Shoulong, Baituo in Gaoyao County, Xinlong Village outside Sihui County, and Canggang, Baisha, Dasha, Shangluo, Sibao, Xiangshawei, the lower and middle districts of Gaoming, and the communication lines between Guangning and various places have all been tragically bombed. The Japanese army's actions are aimed at harassing the rear of the Chinese army, but also at attempting to disrupt the Chinese military transport. However, the entire plan of the Chinese army to counterattack Guangzhou has already been decided by the military authorities. In addition to going east along the West River, the main force will advance along the Yuehan Railway from the North River. Therefore, the Japanese troops on the north bank of the West River still have concerns, fearing that they will be attacked from all sides by the Chinese army. Therefore, the Japanese troops invading Lubao already showed signs of fleeing towards Mumian Gang on the 24th. With the Japanese army at a loss of whether to advance or retreat, the war on the north bank has also become slightly calmer. In order to achieve the goals of capturing Sanzhou and Jinli and invading Gaoyao, the Japanese army on the south bank first attempted to attack the guerrillas near Jiujiang to stabilize Jiujiang. On the other hand, they attacked Gubusha Ping in Heshan County, in order to cover their advance. Therefore, the Chinese guerrillas in the southeast of Jiujiang Shakou and in the Ganzhutan area have been fighting fiercely with the Japanese army from time to time. On the 21st and 22nd, the Japanese army in Jiujiang fired over sixty shells, fiercely bombarding Gubusha Ping, covering the landing of Japanese troops in rubber boats. However, the local self-defense forces and guerrillas rose up to resist, destroying two rubber boats and killing dozens of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army retreated in disarray. Therefore, the port of Heshan is currently tense again.</p>
<p>The Japanese troops invading the West River originally had very few troops. During this period, the Japanese army transferred a large number of troops from the East River to Guangzhou and then reinforced Jiujiang. The Chinese army on the East River took the opportunity to recover Huizhou and Boluo. On the 23rd, the Chinese army continued to send reinforcements to the front line. Their vanguard troops had reached the vicinity of Jiuzitan at the junction of Zeng and Boluo counties. After establishing contact with the troops in Zeng, they would join the counterattack. The large army reinforcing Dongguan has also decided to cross Heyuan, Huizhou, and Boluo to reach Dongguan County, and is currently advancing in two routes: one follows the Danshui River in Huizhou, reaching Longgang at 3 pm on the 23rd, and arriving at Pinghu on the 24th. The mission of this route is to contact Zhang Ruigui's troops guarding Baoan County and Tan Sui's troops holding the line along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, and jointly attack Dongguan County; the other follows the East River upstream, directly attacking Shilong, and taking the opportunity to sweep away the remaining Japanese troops in Taiping and Humen. From this, it is inevitable that a major war will break out on the entire Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line within days.</p>
<p>On the southern front, since over a hundred Japanese warships gathered and patrolled in the Beihai, Weizhou Island, and Hainan Island areas, intending to harass the coast, the situation in various areas of the southern front was extremely tense. By the 24th, the Japanese warships in Dasha, Bailongwei, Shigui Tou, and Guantouling in Beihai had all sailed away, and the situation had eased again. However, the military authorities have dispatched additional troops to strictly guard against emergencies. Currently, Yangjiang and Dianbai are guarded by troops led by × Brigade and × Regiment and × Guerrilla Headquarters Chen Xiujue. The ×× Guerrilla Commander also leads the local forces of Gaozhou and the newly formed × Division and ×× Regiment, guarding the coastal line of Gaozhou. In Beihai, in addition to the troops of the Guajun Mo Shujie and Huang Gu divisions, several divisions of infantry have been continuously arriving from Guangxi Province and stationed there. Currently, the deployment on the southern front is in place, and the strength of the resistance is very strong.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Recapture Yixing, Once Reaching Caoqiao, the Japanese Army's Headquarters</h3>
<p>A telegram from Yixing: According to reliable reports, the Chinese army stationed in the Zhangzhu Mountains of Yixing launched a general attack on the Japanese troops stationed in Yixing City in late December. The two hundred or so Japanese troops in the city, although armed with small steel cannons and light and heavy machine guns, hastily resisted. However, the Chinese army was large and strong, and fiercely attacked the city. After a day and night of fierce fighting, more than half of the Japanese troops were killed or wounded, and the remaining troops fled in disarray to the surrounding villages. The Chinese army recaptured Yicheng on the 24th. A portion of the Japanese troops, numbering several dozen, fled along the highway to Caoqiao Town, where the Japanese army headquarters was located. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to advance and pursued Caoqiao. It is rumored that they even occupied Caoqiao, but this has not been confirmed. Currently, the Chinese army is engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army in Heqiao, more than ten miles away from Yicheng. It is reported that Heqiao is an important town in Yixing, with prosperous commerce and a hub for water and land transportation. It is also learned that after the Chinese army entered Yicheng, they searched for the puppet "County Magistrate" Zang Lichen, but Zang and others had fled beforehand. They destroyed the puppet "County Government" and arrested Xu Kaishan, the "Chairman of the Maintenance Association" of Yicheng. They originally intended to execute him by shooting, but after the elders of Yicheng pleaded for his life, he was spared death and is now imprisoned.</p>

<h3>On Eyeglasses</h3>
<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>1. The Use of Eyes is Great Indeed</p>
<p>The world refers to a person's wisdom as intelligence; "Cong" (聰, listening) refers to the carefulness of hearing; "Ming" (明, seeing) refers to the clarity of sight. The achievement of knowledge and experience, the ability to delve deeply, all come from seeing and hearing, so using "Congming" (聰明, intelligent) to describe a person's wisdom also emphasizes the importance of the ear and eye organs. Since ancient times, the merits and demerits of all things have been perceived by the eyes, and then contemplation and action arise. Without seeing, one loses clarity; losing clarity means not knowing what is superior and what is inferior. The inability to distinguish between superior and inferior leads to a lack of understanding of right and wrong; a lack of understanding of right and wrong leads to a lack of impartiality in justice. Whether it be a large matter concerning society and the nation, or a small matter concerning companies and families, if what is seen is unclear, there will inevitably be a rise in the way of petty people and a decline in the way of gentlemen, leading to the steps of chaos, destruction, and failure. Only with clarity can one distinguish between the virtuous and the treacherous, know good and evil, understand right and wrong, uphold justice, discern obedience and defiance, and strictly follow or reject. Even with enemy countries and foreign troubles, one's spirit will not be taken away; even with poverty and hardship, one's will will not be shaken. Then the country will inevitably be harmonious, and the people will inevitably prosper. This is what Gao Yao meant by "Heaven's intelligence comes from the intelligence of our people," which is precisely to gather the wisdom of the masses and make it the wisdom of society and the nation.</p>
<p>Not only that, but a person's goodness, evil, wisdom, and foolishness can always be seen in their eyes. We do not need physiognomy; we can use Mencius' words to prove it:</p>
<p>"Of all things that exist in a person, nothing is better than the pupils. The pupils cannot hide their evil. If the chest is upright, the pupils are clear; if the chest is not upright, the pupils are dim. Listen to their words, observe their pupils, and how can a person conceal themselves!"</p>
<p>Listening to their words is "Cong" (聰, listening), observing their pupils is "Ming" (明, seeing). A person who cannot clearly discern right and wrong and does not know good from bad is one without eyes. But those who "have sight enough to see the tip of an autumn hair, but cannot see a cartload of firewood," or those who view things through a pipe or measure with a gourd, how can they be called people with eyes!</p>
<p>Due to physiological reasons, people cannot guarantee the uniformity of their eyesight. Those with normal vision can change to farsightedness, becoming unclear about nearby objects; those with nearsightedness cannot distinguish objects beyond a foot away. To compensate for these defects, eyeglasses are used. Eyeglasses allow those with unclear vision to see clearly and enable eyesight to reach where it cannot reach. With eyeglasses, the near can see far, the far can see near, and everything becomes convenient. Moreover, as culture becomes more developed, there are more opportunities to use the eyes, the consumption of eyesight becomes greater, and the need for eyeglasses becomes more widespread. This is a natural trend.</p>
<p>However, those who wear eyeglasses do so originally to seek clarity, but those who wear colored eyeglasses should be careful. Colored eyeglasses are for reducing the irritation of light rays. If one mistakenly believes that the color of the lens is the color of the object, and that what one sees is what others see, then it will be like what Mozi said, "Dyed in blue, it becomes blue; dyed in yellow, it becomes yellow; there is nowhere it does not lose its true nature."</p>
<p>At the beginning of the New Year, there are usually words of celebration and works of interest, but it is difficult to choose such texts within the pages of an economic journal. Desiring to avoid straying from the nature of economics and to see the development of Sino-Western trade, I thought of the ancient saying about health, which often speaks of "acute hearing and clear eyesight, nimble hands and feet." It is also said that those who build great careers must have "broad vision and keen insights." Therefore, I wrote "On Eyeglasses" to wish you all brighter eyes and broader vision, not to be confined to current facts, nor to haggle over one's own interests. Stand firm, broaden your vision, and next year on this day, I will celebrate the victorious New Year with you all. And to show that eyeglasses, though small, are the beginning of Sino-Western trade, this is the study.</p>
<p>2. Where Do Eyeglasses Ultimately Come From?</p>
<p>Did eyeglasses originate in China, or were they imported from foreign countries? A little common-sense research will reveal that they are a product of science and certainly did not originate in China. But then, where did they come from, and when did they first enter China? Due to a lack of records, it is difficult to have accurate verification. The origins of eyeglasses recorded in various books are mostly based on Zhang Jing's "Miscellaneous Records of Fangzhou" from the Ming Dynasty, which states that they came from the Malacca on foreign ships. His father, Lord Fangbo, once received them as a gift from Emperor Xuanmiao, referring to Emperor Xuanzong of the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, eyeglasses already existed during the Xuande reign (1426-1435). But what kind of country was Malacca to have these eyeglasses? This requires first understanding the state of overseas transportation at that time.</p>
<p>According to records, Emperor Chengzu (Yongle Emperor) seized the throne, and Emperor Huiwen fled, whereabouts unknown. Emperor Chengzu suspected that he was still alive and searched for him throughout the country without success, so he wanted to seek him abroad. (1) In June of the third year of Yongle (1405), he ordered the Three Treasures Eunuch Zheng He to lead Wang Jinghong and others to communicate with the Western Oceans. They sailed from Liujia River in Suzhou (now Liuhe), from Liuhe to Ningbo, then transferred to Fujian, and from Fujian went to the South Seas. This journey lasted until September of the fifth year, when they returned to the country. (2) In September of the sixth year, they went to Ceylon and other countries again, and returned to the country in June of the ninth year. (3) In November of the tenth year, he again ordered He to go to Sumatra and other places, and returned to court in July of the thirteenth year. (4) In the fourteenth year, nineteen countries including Malacca and Calicut all sent envoys to pay tribute. Later, he ordered He and others to accompany them to bestow gifts upon their rulers, and they returned in July of the seventeenth year. (5) In the spring of the nineteenth year, they went again, and returned in August of the following year. (6) In January of the twenty-second year, Shi Jisun, the chief of Old Harbor, requested to inherit the position of commissioner, and he was ordered to bring the imperial edict and seal to bestow upon him. By the time he returned, Emperor Chengzu had already passed away. (7) In June of the fifth year of Xuande, the Emperor, seeing that many foreign countries were still far from paying tribute after a long reign, Zheng He and Wang Jinghong were again ordered to visit seventeen countries including Hormuz and return. He went abroad a total of seven times, traveling from the islands of the South Seas to India (Bengal and Ceylon) and more than thirty other countries. The number of unnamed treasures he obtained was countless. "Unnamed" meant that many of them were never seen by the Chinese, so they could not be named. If eyeglasses are also included in these "unnamed treasures," then the Xuande reign should have had this item. Conversely, if it must be said that they came from Malacca, then Malacca in the early Ming Dynasty was still subject to Siam, merely a newly developed tribe. In the first year of Yongle, the Ming eunuch Yin Qing sent envoys to its territory, using gold and silk to entice its chieftain to come to court. In September of the third year, the chieftain followed Qing to Beijing, and Emperor Chengzu enfeoffed him as the King of Malacca. The title of King of Malacca began from this point. Zheng He sent envoys to their country in the sixth year, and tribute was regularly paid from then until the seventeenth year of Chenghua, a total of twenty-three times.</p>
<p>Although tribute was paid frequently, one does not see any glass-like products among its goods. Even judging by their intelligence, it seems unlikely that they could produce eyeglasses. Therefore, in terms of products, it can be compared with the products of Sumatra, which is separated by a narrow strip of water, to see that although there may be handicrafts among Malacca's products, it is doubtful that they were self-produced. The "Blue History" states that Sumatra's climate, customs, and human nature are exactly the same, so its products should be no different.</p>
<p>(1) Malacca's Products:</p>
<p>Agate, pearls, coral trees, helmeted hornbill, golden helmeted hornbill, rhinoceros horn, ivory, black bear, black ape, white muntjac, turkey, parrot, sarong, white cotton cloth, Western cloth, Sahara cloth, borneol camphor, rose water, storax oil, gardenia, Oudh, agarwood, benzoin, gold and silver incense, asafoetida, tin.</p>
<p>(2) Sumatra's Products:</p>
<p>Agate, precious stones, crystal, azurite, Huihui blue, fine horses, rhinoceros, agarwood, benzoin, cloves, ambergris, frankincense, true incense, knife noodles, tin, sarong, pepper, sappanwood, sulfur.</p>
<p>Then how could Malacca have products that Sumatra does not? This can prove that some of Malacca's products were European products. That is why the Ming people said that eyeglasses came from Malacca on foreign ships.</p>
<p>During the Zhengde period of the Ming Dynasty (1511 AD, the sixth year of Zhengde), the Frankish (Portuguese) forcibly invaded and seized their territory. King Su Duan Ma Mo fled and sent envoys to report the difficulty. Emperor Shizong succeeded to the throne and ordered the Frankish to return their former territory, citing the righteousness of helping neighbors in distress. However, there was no response, and Malacca was eventually destroyed. Previously, due to inconvenient transportation, the Ming Dynasty still did not know that the Frankish had destroyed Malacca, so in the thirteenth year of Zhengde (1516 AD), envoys led by Captain Mo and others were sent to offer local products and request enfeoffment. Only then did they learn the name. (According to Portuguese writer Tomé Pires, they arrived in Guangzhou from Malacca in 1516 AD). An edict was issued to give them the value of their local products and send them back. These people stayed for a long time and robbed travelers, even abducting children to eat. Later, they colluded with the eunuch guarding the town to enter Beijing, while Emperor Wuzong made a southern tour (August of the fourteenth year of Zhengde). Their envoy, the eunuch Ya San, served Emperor Jiang Bin, and the Emperor learned their language as a joke. It was not until the fifteenth year that they were allowed to pay tribute. In the sixteenth year, Emperor Wuzong died, and in July of that year, they brought local products to seek trade, but were refused. Their general, Bidulu, with his powerful cannons and sharp weapons, plundered Malacca and other countries, rampaging on the sea. He also led his subordinates to attack the Balaxi country with five ships. In the second year of Jiajing (1523 AD), they invaded Xicao Bay in Xinhui. The Ming commander Ke Rong and others resisted them, captured Bidulu and others alive, and obtained their cannons, which were named "Frankish cannons," and cut off their trade. However, at that time, the officials of Guangdong all collected fees from foreign ships for public and private expenses. If foreign ships did not arrive, they would have nothing to gain, so they requested the court to allow them to trade again. Thus, the Frankish were able to enter Xiangshan'ao (Macau) to trade. By the fourteenth year of Jiajing, the Portuguese had built houses and cities in Xiangshan'ao, dominating the seaside like a country. The tall buildings and flying eaves stood in rows, and merchants from Fujian and Guangdong flocked to them. Over time, more and more of them came, and people from other countries feared and avoided them, so they were occupied exclusively by them. In the forty-fourth year of Jiajing, they still claimed to be paying tribute from Malacca. The court officials knew that it was a false pretense by the Frankish and refused them. But later, people from the Atlantic Ocean (Italians) and others came to China and also lived there.</p>
<p>The customs of Malacca were originally simple and honest, and trade was fair. But since it was broken by the Frankish, its customs have changed greatly, and merchant ships rarely arrive, mostly going directly to Sumatra. However, they must pass through its country, and are often robbed, almost cutting off the sea route. Those who sell directly to China arrive directly at Xiangshan'ao in Guangdong, and the arrivals are endless.</p>
<p>From this historical fact, Malacca was already occupied by the Frankish during the Zhengde period, and until the forty-fourth year of Jiajing, the Frankish still claimed to be from Malacca when traveling to and from China. This is because the Chinese only knew of Malacca, so the Frankish claimed to be Malacca. They did not know that the so-called Frankish were far in the western corner of Europe, while Malacca was near the southern end of Siam. Historians still said that the Frankish and Malacca were close to each other, how could others distinguish the distance of their lands? The confusion between the Frankish and Malacca is the origin of the misconception that eyeglasses came from Malacca.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Ming people also obtained eyeglasses from the Western Regions. Wu Kuan's "Pao Weng Collection" has a poem thanking someone for sending him eyeglasses from the Western Regions:</p>
<p>"The world says that Li Lou had keen eyes,</p>
<p>His eyes could not be obscured.</p>
<p>After a thousand years of decay,</p>
<p>They transform and are worth a hundred yi."</p>
<p>Wu Kuan was the champion of the Ming Dynasty's Chenghua eight-year imperial examination. He was from Changzhou (even today, people still enjoy talking about the Four Talents of Wu: Tang, Zhu, Wen, and Xu, all of whom were Wu's later generations). He served through the Chenghua, Hongzhi, and Zhengde reigns, and died in office. He was known for his high moral character, and his poems and essays were considered classic for his time. He praised the eyeglasses from the Western Regions so highly, comparing them to the sight of Li Lou (a famous ancient person with keen eyesight), saying that they transformed after a thousand years and were worth a hundred yi (each yi is twenty-four taels, this phrase emphasizes how valuable it was). How much he cherished them! Therefore, the description of eyeglasses in the "General Draft of Seven Revisions" seems like mythology today. It says:</p>
<p>"I heard that noblemen have eyeglasses. When old men read books, they can see even the smallest characters. They are truly worldly treasures. These are made with living giant clam shells as the lens. They must always be kept warm in the bosom, lest they dry out and die, and then they can illuminate the characters."</p>
<p>Why are there such bizarre and absurd stories, and why are they so valuable? According to the "General Encyclopedia," eyeglasses from the Western Regions became popular in China during the middle of the Ming Dynasty. Merchants exaggerated their claims, so people at that time were fooled like this. According to records, land transportation between Europe and Asia began in the Han Dynasty, and became even more frequent during the Yuan Dynasty, reaching deep into Central Europe. By the Ming Dynasty, although various countries west of the city were as far as Arabia, many entered Jiayu Pass by land. In the fifth year of Yide, Zheng He sent envoys to the Western Oceans, sending envoys to Calicut. Calicut had ships to Arabia, so he sent people to attach to their boats to go there. Arabia also sent envoys to pay tribute, and Emperor Yizong was greatly pleased. After that, countries from Arabia often traveled by sea via Java and Malacca, while those traveling by land still entered Jiayu Pass from the western city.</p>
<p>From this perspective, eyeglasses flowed into China as early as the Yide period, and as late as the Hongzhi and Zhengde periods. One route of import was from Malacca on foreign ships, and the other was from the Western Regions. In short, they both flowed in indirectly from the West.</p>
<p>3. The Naming and Form of Eyeglasses</p>
<p>Eyeglasses were originally called "Aihdai" (僾逮), also written as (　　). "Aihdai" (僾逮) originally meant the appearance of clouds, which is unrelated to eyeglasses. It is suspected that word-makers thought the two characters "Aihdai" (璦逮) were not elegant enough, so they changed them. But why are eyeglasses called "Aihdai" (僾逮)? This has not been explained by previous people. Some think it means "as if." But using "as if" to describe eyeglasses is also difficult to interpret. I suspect that it is a transliteration that also captures the idea of resembling the eyes, hence the name "Aihdai" (僾逮). If it is a transliteration, it should have been transliterated from Portuguese, Malay, or Arabic. I am not familiar with these three languages. However, many of the tribute items recorded in the "History of the Ming Dynasty" already used transliterations, such as "Saha La," "Duo Luo Lian," "Wu Die Ni," and "Bai Bi Bu," which are evidence of this. However, in English (although English was not popular in the East at that time), the terms for eyeglasses, such as "Spectacle" and "Eye-glass," have no scent of "Aihdai" (僾逮) to be found. Only "Eyed" is somewhat similar, but it is an adjective, and its meaning is not very appropriate. Later people also thought that it was the local language of the Fujian and Guangdong people at that time, which was passed down and written in this book. In short, the two characters "Aihdai" (僾逮), when used for eyeglasses, cannot clearly show the use of the object, which is very inappropriate. Therefore, in Wu Kuan's poems from the Zhengde era, the term "eyeglasses" (眼鏡) was already used. Because the meaning of "Jing" (鏡, mirror) has the meaning of illuminating and viewing, using it for the eyes, hence the name "Yanjing" (眼鏡, eyeglasses), fully shows the function and form, which is much better than the ambiguous and unclear "Aihdai" (僾逮), so it has been used until now.</p>
<p>The Ming people described the shape of eyeglasses in Zhang Jing's "Miscellaneous Records of Fangzhou":</p>
<p>"Like two large coins, their shape and color are very similar to mica, but their texture is very thin. They are outlined and buttoned with gold, so that when closed, they become one, and when opened, they become two. When the eyes of old people are dim, placing this object on both eyes makes them very clear. They come from the country of Malacca on foreign ships, and are called 'Aihdai' (靉靆). They are all made of glass, and later, the people of Guangdong imitated their style and made them with crystal stones."</p>
<p>Therefore, in the "Poetry Collection of Ou Bei," the first poem using eyeglasses says:</p>
<p>"It is said that during the Xuande reign,</p>
<p>They came from foreign ships.</p>
<p>Originally inlaid with glass,</p>
<p>Thin as freshly polished paper.</p>
<p>The Central Kingdom imitated and made them,</p>
<p>Crystal also became a cheap imitation."</p>
<p>The change from glass to crystal for eyeglasses was precisely because China had no glass production. There is also a popular seven-character poem about eyeglasses (pagoda style), which is also laughable.</p>
<p>Previous people have also written several couplets about eyeglasses, with roughly the same ideas, such as:</p>
<p>"A long string is tied to both ears,</p>
<p>A horizontal bridge straddles the nose."</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>From Daoyi's poems, it can be seen that the eyeglasses of the previous generations mostly used strings as earpieces, worn on both ears.</p>
<p>4. Reading Glasses and Nearsighted Glasses</p>
<p>In the ninth year of Wanli (1581 AD), the Italian Matteo Ricci arrived at Xiangshan'ao in Guangzhou. In the twenty-ninth year, he entered Beijing, sending Wang Fengyang, Su Mano, and others to Nanjing. Those who came with them also included the Italian Long Huamin, Bi Fangji, Ai Rueluo, and Xiong Sanba, the German Deng Yuhan, the Spaniard Pang Diwo, and the Portuguese Yang Manuo, all of whom were engaged in spreading the Catholic faith. Scholars such as Xu Guangqi and Li Zhizao were fond of their teachings, so Western culture and products flowed into the mainland with the missionaries. Eyeglasses were also among them.</p>
<p>However, eyeglasses were still rare at that time, and it was still the case in the early Qing Dynasty. Therefore, when Jiang Tingxi saw that Emperor Kangxi had eyeglasses in the inner court, he begged for one for his mother. Also, in the book "Dream of the Red Chamber," which was written about the Kangxi and Yongzheng periods, even in a family like the Jia family, only the Jia mother had eyeglasses, and they were only mentioned three times in the whole book. As in volume 53, it says:</p>
<p>"There was also a mirror box. The Jia mother leaned on the pillow, chatting and laughing with everyone, and then took out her eyeglasses to look at the stage. She also said, 'Forgive me for being old and my bones hurting. Allow me to be presumptuous and accompany you leaning down!'"</p>
<p>And in volume 69, it says:</p>
<p>"Second Sister (You Erjie) stood beside her with her head down. The Jia mother looked her up and down, and then smiled and asked, 'What is your name? How old are you this year?' Feng Jie quickly smiled and said, 'Old ancestor, don't ask yet, just say whether she is prettier than me or not.' The Jia mother put on her eyeglasses again and ordered Mandarin Duck and Amber to pull the child over for me to see her skin.' Everyone smiled with their mouths pursed and pushed her forward. The Jia mother looked carefully and ordered Amber to take out her hand for me to see. The Jia mother looked up and down, took off her eyeglasses, smiled and said, 'She is indeed a complete child. I think she is even prettier than you (referring to Feng Jie).'"</p>
<p>The third time eyeglasses are mentioned is in volume 95, which says:</p>
<p>"When the Jia mother opened it, she saw that the jade was much dimmer than before. She rubbed it with her hand, and Mandarin Duck put on her eyeglasses and took a look, saying, 'Strange, the piece of jade is indeed the same, but why has the color disappeared inside!'"</p>
<p>It should be known that Shezheng, Lady Wang, and others are all in their fifties. They should be wearing eyeglasses. Although it is said that when parents are alive, one does not speak of being old, and one does not wear eyeglasses in front of elders, but even when in casual settings, there is no mention of wearing eyeglasses. Also, like Granny Liu, who is over seventy years old, there is no mention of eyeglasses, precisely because eyeglasses were still rare at that time, and only high-ranking officials and noble families had them. They were not commonly seen among the people.</p>
<p>Moreover, the difficulty in obtaining eyeglasses is further proven by the following facts: (1) Chinese books, due to the use of woodblock printing, could not have very fine characters, which was also for the convenience of elderly people to read, so the font was usually large. (2) If a family had eyeglasses, they were very precious, and often passed down from parents to children. The earpieces would be broken, and they would be tied with cloth strings and worn on both ears. If they were easily obtained, why would there be such a situation? Therefore, at that time, elderly people rarely wore eyeglasses. If there were eyeglasses available to wear but not worn, it was considered amazing.</p>
<p>It is said that when the scholar Weng Fanggang (Tanxi) was in his sixties or seventies, he could still write fine characters under the lamp without using "Aihdai" (eyeglasses). Every year on New Year's Day, he wrote four regular script characters on watermelon seeds. After fifty, he wrote "Wan Shou Wu Jiang" (Long Live); after sixty, he wrote "Tian Zi Wan Nian" (Emperor Live Ten Thousand Years); after seventy, he could still write "Tian Xia Tai Ping" (Peace Under Heaven). Although his writing gradually decreased, being able to write these characters on a watermelon seed at an old age is something that no one can achieve. (If Weng Tanxi were alive today, he would definitely write "Zhonghua Wansui" (Long Live China) yesterday on New Year's Day). It is also said that Weng was able to write the seven characters "A Piece of Ice Heart in a Jade Pot" on a sesame seed in his early years. The superiority of his eyesight was truly an unusual gift, and his skill was also miraculous.</p>
<p>What is mentioned above mostly refers to reading glasses. Nearsighted glasses have not been seen. Because there were no eyeglasses for nearsightedness, those who suffered from nearsightedness had to squint their eyes and get close to things to see them, which was often called "squinting eyes." Previous people had a poem mocking nearsighted eyes:</p>
<p>"Laughing at your eyes, so strange,</p>
<p>Standing next to you, I ask who you are.</p>
<p>In the sunlight, I grab at eggs,</p>
<p>As the moon moves, I gather firewood.</p>
<p>From looking at wall paintings, I wear through my nose,</p>
<p>From locking the bookcase, I pinched my eyebrows.</p>
<p>Even more ridiculous is this:</p>
<p>Blowing out the lamp, I burned my lips."</p>
<p>It can be seen that if those suffering from nearsightedness had eyeglasses, they would not suffer this loss. I recall that the prevalence of nearsighted glasses was still between the Guangxu and Xuantong periods. At that time, those who suffered from nearsightedness began to use eyeglasses. There were no nearsighted glasses during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. How can this be proven? It can be proven by Qianlong.</p>
<p>It is said that Qianlong also suffered from nearsightedness. When he made a southern tour to Suzhou and arrived at Hushu Pass, he did not see the three dots of water next to it and mistakenly called it "Xu 　Pass." People thought it came from the emperor, so they followed suit. (Later, Liang Zhangju defended Qianlong, saying that it could be read as "Xu," but dictionaries all read it as "Hu.") Therefore, if there were nearsighted glasses at that time, Qianlong would definitely not have failed to see the water.</p>
<p>There is another proof of Qianlong's nearsightedness. The reason for nearsightedness is that the eyeball protrudes, and the line of sight falls in front of the focal point. Therefore, as one gets older, the eyeball naturally contracts and gradually flattens, the line of sight approaches the focal point, and one can see objects without eyeglasses. Therefore, Qianlong's not using eyeglasses in his later years is proof of his nearsightedness. It is said that after Ruan Yuan (Yuntai) entered the History Office, He Shen happened to be in charge of the academy, and Yuan treated him with great respect as a disciple. Shortly thereafter, there was a major examination of the Hanlin Academy, and Emperor Gaozong (Qianlong) used eyeglasses as the topic. He Shen knew that Qianlong did not use eyeglasses in his old age, so he leaked the information to Yuan in advance. Therefore, Yuan's poem says:</p>
<p>"Why does the four-eyed need this?</p>
<p>The double-pupiled does not need another."</p>
<p>Emperor Gaozong used "another" as the rhyme, and praised the poem, placing it in the first rank. When Ji Xiaolan (Yun) was summoned to see him, Qianlong also ordered him to write a poem about eyeglasses, using "another" as the rhyme. Ji immediately recited a couplet:</p>
<p>"How can the wise and bright one need this?</p>
<p>Your humble servant must have another."</p>
<p>They both used the fact that Qianlong did not wear eyeglasses in his old age in their poems, which clearly shows that he suffered from nearsightedness.</p>
<p>As for the officials who suffered from nearsightedness, there were many. During the Yongzheng period, a certain lord was very nearsighted. One day when he entered the court, Yongzheng asked him, "Can you see me?" He replied, "The Emperor's majesty does not violate the face within a foot." His response can be said to be quick.</p>
<p>Sun Erzhun (Pingshu), the Duke of Jin Gui and Wen Qing, was originally nearsighted. One year, he traveled to the Qiantang River and encountered the autumn tide. He was very happy and wanted to watch the tide, so he set out a boat in the middle of the river to wait. When the tide arrived, he heard the sound of ten thousand horses galloping and rushed to the bow of the boat. The boatman advised him against it, but he did not listen. Before he could stand still, he was swept into the river by the tide. In a hurry, he only felt the waves pressing over his shoulders and back, with the weight of ten million pounds, tossing and turning three or four times, and then he was thrown onto the riverbank, unharmed. Sun himself said that he had always been nearsighted, and although he was greatly frightened, he did not recognize the shape of the tide.</p>
<p>My study on eyeglasses ends here. The recent prevalence of eyeglasses, the improvement of styles, and the types of lenses are not included in this study, so they are omitted. Some of my friends who see this article will definitely smile and say, "Liu is using his energy on such things, making a mountain out of a molehill, which is very meaningless." But those who say this have never known my intention. Is it really that I like to do this? There is nothing to do to pass the time, so I am just writing this as a conversation starter for the New Year for you all.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>The New Year of Language and Writing</h3>
<p>— Zheng Rong</p>
<p>Our Chinese language and writing, with its long history and deep, broad cultural background in both modern vernacular and classical forms, is indeed one of our most valuable cultural assets. However, there are four difficulties that often plague people: first, it is difficult to look up words; second, it is difficult to learn; third, it is difficult to read; and fourth, it is difficult to write. For many years, countless knowledgeable and ambitious people have tried to overcome these four major difficulties, but they have not yet fully succeeded.</p>
<p>To address the difficulty of looking up words, there have been various indexing schemes. I don't know how many types of indexing schemes there are, but the most popular one now is Mr. Wang Yunwu's Four-Corner Method. In addition to being used universally for books published by the Commercial Press, it has also been adopted elsewhere. However, other schemes are still being promoted simultaneously, so it cannot be considered the only one.</p>
<p>Second, to address the difficulty of learning, there have been various schemes for basic characters. We have also seen many basic character schemes, with the "Thousand Character Classic" being popular in the past and the "Common People's Thousand Character Course" being popular recently. In addition to the "Thousand Character Course," there is also Mr. Hong Shen's "Twelve Hundred Characters." Currently, these are all being promoted separately.</p>
<p>Third, to address the difficulty of reading, there have been schemes for unifying pronunciation or phonetic notation. We have also seen countless schemes, some original and some adopted from existing systems. Among the original ones, there are many types, including radical-based systems, shorthand systems, seal script systems, cursive script systems, and others, all of which have now disappeared. The most popular are three types that adopt existing scripts: one adopts existing ancient Chinese characters, called Zhuyin Fuhao (Phonetic Symbols); and two adopt existing international alphabets, one called Gwoyeu Romatzyh (National Romanization), and one called Latinxua Sin Wenz (Latinized Chinese Characters). Among these, the one that adopts ancient Chinese characters is only used to annotate the pronunciation of ordinary Chinese characters, so it is called Zhuyin Fuhao. The two that adopt international alphabets are not only used for phonetic notation, but also attempt to function as self-sufficient writing systems, thus attempting to solve the three difficulties beyond just reading. Currently, all three are being promoted separately.</p>
<p>Fourth, to address the difficulty of writing, there have been explorations of grammar, rhetoric, and various other rules, as well as experiments with various language teaching methods, in an attempt to break away from the old habit that Mr. Ma Jianzhong described as "because there are aspects of literature that cannot be taught, even those that can be taught are not discussed."</p>
<p>The efforts in all four areas are aimed at preventing everyone from spending too much time and effort on language and writing, and at preventing language and writing themselves from remaining forever in the mysterious realm of "can be understood but not expressed," untouched by scientific illumination. Although there is a lot of work, it can actually be summarized as "progress through simplification." Although opinions on various schemes are not entirely consistent among all those who are dedicated to this cause, there is no disagreement on the need for this simplified progress in language and writing reform. What is lacking is coordination and communication. If we can go a step further and bring our opinions closer together or coordinate our work, the efforts in language and writing reform will surely be more effective. Perhaps in as little as three years, we can create a new year for language and writing that eliminates all four difficulties, and the popularization of education and the advancement of culture will surely be several times easier than they are now. I sincerely hope that everyone will keep this matter in mind and make it one of their New Year's resolutions.</p>
<h3>New Year's in Phoenix Town</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>As the night gradually fell, the sky filled with the sound of firecrackers, and every thatched cottage and hut radiated the glow of candles. The aroma of New Year's Eve dinner wafted in the biting cold wind. The entire Phoenix Town seemed to shed its decline and poverty in the joyful atmosphere of New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>Stationed in an ancient temple, we looked at the New Year's scene in the town and couldn't help but seek out the forgotten joys of the New Year. One of our comrades, speaking in his Nanjing Mandarin, said, "It's still one hundred and eighty li to Qianqian. We won't be able to chop those xx until next year anyway, so let's have a happy New Year's Eve here!"</p>
<p>Just as he finished speaking, a messenger suddenly ran in to report, "We're setting off early tomorrow morning. The battalion commander has given special permission to celebrate the New Year here. The pork that was supposed to be eaten on New Year's Day tomorrow will be distributed tonight."</p>
<p>"Great! New Year's, New Year's!" A group of comrades immediately cheered excitedly upon hearing this news, their eyes sparkling with joy. They set up iron stoves in the courtyard and began cooking rice and roasting meat. The unusual cold was dispelled by the flames and the aroma of meat, and everyone was intoxicated by the enjoyment of abundant material goods.</p>
<p>However, celebrating the New Year in the military is not as leisurely and carefree as it is for the common people. Just as we were about to eat the meat, a sentry came to report that someone was sneaking across the Phoenix River. Then, a series of challenge passwords were heard from outside, each one more urgent than the last. We immediately ran out of the ancient temple, divided into two groups, and surrounded the riverbank, trapping four spies who had crossed the警戒line. At this moment, a fire suddenly broke out behind the ancient temple, and several gunshots were heard from the village to the east. The situation was indeed extremely serious. We immediately split into four groups and, using rapid marching, patrolled and searched the surroundings. In an instant, sixteen arsonist traitors and four enemy soldiers in plainclothes were subdued with our hemp ropes and escorted to the battalion headquarters like cowherds leading cattle.</p>
<p>On the way, the four enemy soldiers in plainclothes pleaded with us in broken Chinese, and then spoke among themselves in some foreign language "...is...亨得拿打...." At the same time, they took out a roll of banknotes from their pockets, meaning to bribe us to let them go. What a despicable act! An insult to the personality of the soldiers of our new China. We kicked them, "Budu" a sound, stopping their talk, causing them to retract their hands that held the banknotes, and a row of prisoners and traitors were escorted to the regiment headquarters in silent walking.</p>
<p>The battalion commander, who was reviewing the map under the dim light of a bean oil lamp, listened to our report and seemed to look pleased. Smiling, he ordered them to be released, and then addressed us: "I used this time to test the defensive capabilities and quick wits of you new recruits, and also to examine your adherence to duty. Now I sent twenty people out, not a single one had been missed, and money was not accepted as bribes. Although you are new recruits, I am very satisfied..." After the battalion commander concluded his remarks, his gaze was bright, as if entrusting an expectation to us.</p>
<p>We saw that the twenty disguised brothers had all changed back into their original military uniforms and felt a bit empty with the joy in our hearts; dejectedly walked out of the headquarters, our hearts filled with the yearning to catch real enemies in the future.</p>
<p>After returning to the team, they also received a special reward of twenty pounds of meat from the battalion commander—a towel. While gobbling up the food, New Year's Eve quietly passed away, and the god of time brought New Year's Day to the world. Although the biting north wind was howling in the sky, the dynamics of the villages and towns revealed the atmosphere of the New Spring after all.</p>
<h3>The Arrival of the New</h3>
<p>— Liu Shou</p>
<p>With just a few hours separating us, everything from the past was buried, expelled! Only "New" fills this world, bringing fresh light!</p>
<p>Everyone is waiting, praying: for the arrival of this "New." "New" presides over this world, presides over all people!</p>
<p>In the human world, on the earth, everywhere there are lively and beautiful embryos, growing in the "New," forgetting the sins of the past, the shames of the past, the worries of the past, the past of…</p>
<p>"New" bestows upon us infinite pleasure, extreme joy, inspiring us to advance, to glorify; like a gentle breeze, awakening the flowers, glistening dew drops, nourishing the grass and trees, everything is awakening in the arrival of the "New," growing vigorously,</p>
<p>In the universe, perhaps darkness has already dissipated! All that can be seen is light, all that can exist is light!</p>
<p>This is where heroes put their skills to use, when great people go to war, like a lone boat on the sea, seeing the light of a lighthouse from afar, like a traveler climbing a mountain, reaching the top.</p>
<p>It is the "New" that will make us triumphant, that will sing songs of praise for us, words of blessing. "New" indicates our fulfilling fate, everyone loves the "New," cherishes the "New"!</p>
<p>This is the time of the arrival of the new, but we do not know when it will leave. We can only start building our new careers now.</p>
<p>The new has come, has arrived! For the decadent, it has injected clean blood; for the passive, it has provided the right medicine. Only the "New" can drive away the large group of ghosts and kill billions of germs.</p>
<p>The new has arrived, let the people embark on their journeys!</p>
<h3>Boat</h3>
<p>— Yang Yanqi</p>
<p>Because I live on an "island," I think of boats.</p>
<p>Among all means of transportation, the boat is what I like best; because the boat sails on the sea, I love the vast and boundless sea; and appreciating the sea view is impossible without sitting on a boat, so I love boats, for no other reason.</p>
<p>In summer, the summer in my imagination, sitting on the deck looking at the sunset reflected on the sea surface, how wonderful! But now it is winter. In winter, the cold wind, the heavy wind, the face-stinging wind, the angry wind, on the sea, blows up waves, lets the waves jump up, jump in the air, like a ping-pong ball falling on marble. This is also the sea scenery, the lively sea scenery, and only lying on a small boat can one appreciate the fun.</p>
<p>Boats, steamers, steamboats, sailboats, lifeboats are all things on the water. And the water, you can't catch it, you can't hold it tight, it floats, it flows, and it never stops. The earth is turning, the sun is shining, the moon reflects the light of the sun, the stars are twinkling, mankind is forever squirming on the ground, and the boat is forever swimming on the water, swimming, swimming, swimming, until the future.</p>
<p>Isn't life a boat? Crossing from this shore to the other shore is a lifetime. If the boat capsizes halfway, then it can only perish forever; if there is flesh and blood, there is life, then struggle, overcome the wind and waves, tighten the high sail, hold the rudder, and let peace and quiet squeeze out of the difficulties.</p>
<p>The sea is quiet, the water is smooth, waiting for the light on the other shore.</p>
<p>Heaven? Hell? Without a boat to ferry, how can you stand firm that day? Swaying east, swaying west, two eyes staring blankly at the lights on the other shore, waiting in vain, waiting in vain for a lifetime.</p>
<p>When the paddle is rowed, the boat will move, will float on the water, and will also proceed to the harbor in front.</p>
<p>The French poet Baudelaire (C. Baudelaire) said: "The harbor is a pleasant dwelling for someone tired of the hardships of life. The distant sky, the changing clouds, the uncertain sea colors, and the light of the lighthouse, form a beautiful view, enough to make the eyes enjoy it tirelessly. The long boat, with some tangled rigging that sways with the waves, is enough to keep the soul with the beautiful taste of loving rhythm. And for people without ambition and curiosity, there is a mystery, a noble pleasure. Sitting quietly in a building, or leaning on the railing on the shore, quietly watching the activities of those people: some are setting sail, some are sailing back, and some still have the desire to travel or want to make a fortune."</p>
<p>This "beautiful view," this "mysterious and noble pleasure," is on the sea, in the boat, in front of our eyes, and even more in our minds.</p>
<p>We also have the "desire power," not to travel, not to make a fortune, but to prop up a big ship, overcome the waves, flatten all the harmful magic waves, and destroy all the unrighteous demons; let a small boat quietly float on the Pacific Ocean, watching the sun sink in the beautiful scenery of the west.</p>
<h3>Entering the City (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ding Ti</p>
<p>There were four of us in the group.</p>
<p>A long ridge of fields gradually disappeared behind us. Ahead was a continuous expanse of ochre fields, dry, boundless.</p>
<p>The clouds overhead were light and飘飘, very thin, thin enough to be somewhat transparent, azure, like lake water, like a sapphire.</p>
<p>We passed by the entrance of the "Epidemic Hospital," our hearts trembling, a knot of hatred entangled, like a snake, like a nail hammered into our chests.</p>
<p>That black, big house, it really is a man-eating devil! What a big thing! Its black and white walls, row by row, are gloomy; long and terrifying, it never ends.</p>
<p>We were so exhausted from yesterday that we had no strength at all, and we didn't speak to anyone. After a long silence, Lao Wang turned his head back, looked at that black thing, swallowed, and said with a lot of energy:</p>
<p>"Damn it! Epidemic hospital! Fooling ghosts! How many living people have been burned to death!"</p>
<p>Lao Lin, who was walking behind me, also chimed in:</p>
<p>"My neighbor was even more miserable! A rickshaw puller, suffering from malaria, was getting better. But, I don't know how, he was kicked by some damned military police, and they dragged him away. What a good thing! His life was over! Sent to this hospital, the doctor shook his head, shook his head, and sent him to the crematorium; without letting his wife say anything, a few torches, ready-made, a few puffs of smoke, a few balls of fire, and a living person died. Serves him right! Who told him to get sick! You go and reason with them!"</p>
<p>Neither Lao Zhang nor I answered. Our hearts were full of concern and restlessness.</p>
<p>We were tired and tortured enough by yesterday.</p>
<p>The beacon fire of the fighters was finally raised for us. We don't believe in our own strength, but justice encourages us, comforts us. We are walking on a difficult road, each holding a beacon in our hands, a beacon of light, and we finally see the light. The beacon fire! We still have it in our hands; if the right hand is cut off, there is still the left hand; if the left hand is cut off, we still have a heart, we still have an immortal soul.</p>
<p>That black and ugly hospital was thrown far, far away, and a large city lay across in front of us, our hearts coming alive.</p>
<p>Lao Wang reminded us!</p>
<p>"We're walking too fast! None of you are thinking, it's better to walk slowly! Look, where did that little cart go? I don't know where it went. Not too close, not too far."</p>
<p>Really, that little cart had fallen too far behind. It was a good thing Lao Wang thought of it, otherwise we would have honestly, swaggeringly entered the city, and if the cart couldn't find us after entering the city, that would have been really troublesome.</p>
<p>"Wait for that little cart!" We sat under a red-leaved tree, our eyes looking at the dense pine forest, a piece of sky, under the sky—a tree, a thatched shed, occasionally a few desolate birds. Our eyes followed the birds, coming from the east, going to the west, our eyes aching.</p>
<p>We anxiously asked each other, why hasn't it come yet?</p>
<p>Then ask two times, three times… everyone is asking, but no one is answering.</p>
<p>After a long silence, I asked tremblingly:</p>
<p>"Did something go wrong?"</p>
<p>"Maybe something went wrong."</p>
<p>"Impossible! The sacks are packed well, rice, squeeze it and it's rice, break a hole and look, and it's still rice, damn it ××! Knowing the secrets inside! I swear I don't believe it!"</p>
<p>"Ah! These days there are so many ×× inspectors on the road! Cavalry, cars, tanks, …If the secret is broken, alas! That's terrible! Terrible!"</p>
<p>Lao Lin kept sighing.</p>
<p>We lowered our heads and silently thought. Suddenly, two people came out of the pine forest, the trees were parted, brushing sound, turning from the field embankment onto the main road. A thin, yellow old man and a vigorous young man came towards us. The young man stopped and exclaimed, "Ah!" Our dream was broken by him.</p>
<p>The young man said:</p>
<p>"Confused! Confused! Alas! I forgot to bring that plaster (pass), it's not good to go to the city!"</p>
<p>The old man's face was so anxious that the veins on his forehead bulged out:</p>
<p>"You are so confused! Ah! Don't even think about entering the city!"</p>

<h3>Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association</h3>
<p>— Tao Leqin</p>
<p>Continued Management Within the Concession</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association was established on October 14th of the ninth year of the Republic of China. Its historical outline before the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China is recorded in the Shen Bao Yearbook and the Shanghai Municipal Yearbook, so I will not repeat it here to save space. What should be said here is the status of the Association after the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, its position in the Public Concession, and the characteristics of its political organization.</p>
<p>In April of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, due to the increase in members and the need for economic elections, its representative assembly resolved to amend the constitution. The term of office of its eighty-one representatives was changed from one year to two years; the executive committee was increased from twenty-two members to thirty-five members; the standing committee was increased from three members to five members; of the five directors attending the Municipal Council, three-fifths were selected to remain in office; and of the seven committee members, four-sevenths were selected to remain in office, in order to be familiar with the work and to have deep qualifications; the term of office remained one year.</p>
<p>As for the Association's position in the Public Concession, if viewed from the perspective of a politician, it is naturally equal to that of the Western Ratepayers' Association; if viewed from the principle of politics, there should be no room for discrimination. However, among Chinese and foreigners, there seem to be the following misunderstandings:</p>
<p>1.  That the Association has not yet obtained legal recognition.</p>
<p>2.  That the directors and committee members elected by the Association to attend the Municipal Council are representatives of the Chinese ratepayers who negotiate with the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Such misunderstandings are naturally easy to occur due to historical and formal reasons. However, the principle of "no taxation without representation" is regarded as the golden rule by the great Anglo-Saxon nation, which is most abundant in political consciousness, and they would rather die than give up this second life. If taxpayers have the demand to participate in politics, then even with any great force, it is difficult to stop them. Therefore, the inaugural meeting of the Association was held at the Municipal Hall owned by the Municipal Council at the south end of Nanjing Road. Taking the unwritten constitution of England as an example, the Association has become a legal basis in the Public Concession with the same effect as the Western Ratepayers' Association, and it is an organization recognized by China and the countries concerned. Last year, the origin of the Chinese directors and committee members of the Municipal Council was specifically and clearly written into the charter of the Public Concession in accordance with the exchange of notes between the Chinese government and the representatives of the countries concerned. What is still considered regrettable is that the Association has not yet formally gone through the procedures of passing and approving the reports and budgets of the Municipal Council, so the root of this misunderstanding has not been completely eradicated. This is what is hoped that wise people concerned will strive to correct.</p>
<p>Regarding the second misunderstanding, the reason is that the Public Concession is regarded as an area governed by foreigners. In fact, it only allows foreigners to rent land in the designated area to build and do business. Therefore, all residents in the area, such as joint-stock companies, are all shareholders; the board of directors of the Municipal Council is equivalent to the board of directors of a joint-stock company; the actions of the board of directors of the Municipal Council are whole, inseparable, and jointly responsible, and they should not take inconsistent actions towards the outside world due to different nationalities. Just like the board of directors of a joint-stock company, they are jointly responsible to all shareholders. Once this purpose is clear, one can recognize that the directors and committee members elected by the Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association to attend the Municipal Council are not representatives of the Chinese ratepayers who negotiate with the Municipal Council, but members of the Municipal Council. As for making appeals or requests to the Municipal Council on behalf of the Chinese ratepayers, the Association should bear its responsibility, and there should be absolutely no evasion.</p>
<p>The most important characteristic of the organization of a political group is to accommodate members from all aspects as much as possible, so that it can represent the opinions and wishes of all aspects as much as possible. If its organization can have this characteristic, it can achieve the effect of harmony, cooperation, and mutual assistance among political groups. On the contrary, if one or several aspects are treated differently, it will inevitably lead to uneasiness. The ultimate goal of politics is to seek the happiness of all members of the group, not just the happiness of a few or a certain group of people. For this reason, authoritative thinkers, politicians, and jurists in the world are writing books and expressing opinions, and they are proposing various suggestions for improving the organization of political groups.</p>
<p>Before the European War, the existing political organization in the world was the representative system, which had two types: representing population and representing locality, and they were divided into upper and lower houses to form a parliament. After the European War, influenced by the guild representative system of the British Confucian, mathematical philosopher Russell, the vocational representative system was gradually adopted. The representative system before the war was only horizontal, and there was no vertical aspect; after the war, it also covered the vertical aspect. However, after the European War, influenced by the slogan of "national self-determination" put forward by the US President Wilson, only the Soviet Union had the setting of representing the degree of the nation.</p>
<p>Wu Yugan praised the above-mentioned vertical and horizontal representative system in his essay in the Oriental Magazine. The organization of the Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association had been implemented two years earlier; it shows that the matter belongs to the truth, and the actual theory must be consistent.</p>
<p>The members of the Association are divided into two types: group members and individual members. Group members include three types: commercial groups, hometown groups, and civic groups. Elections are divided into three groups: individual member group, hometown group (civic groups belong to it), and commercial group. All eighty-one representatives are elected by three groups, each electing one-third, that is, each group elects twenty-seven people. Individual members can be said to represent those who hold real estate worth more than seven hundred yuan, or who pay full land tax or house tax of more than fourteen yuan; civic groups can be said to represent the entire body of citizens; commercial groups can be said to represent business groups; hometown groups can be said to represent various gangs similar to nationalities. In this way, the representative assembly formed by the eighty-one representatives can be said to include the representatives of all Chinese in the Public Concession.</p>
<p>The organizational system of the Association is (1) Chinese ratepayers, (2) representative assembly, (3) executive committee, (4) standing committee, (5) chairman. Its activities are carried out in the following way: routine matters are handled with the approval of the chairman; important matters are decided by the standing committee meeting; more important matters are decided by the executive committee meeting; particularly important matters are decided by the representative assembly. All non-routine matters that have a time-sensitive relationship and must be handled urgently are approved and implemented directly by the chairman, and then submitted to the respective meetings for ratification.</p>
<p>So far, the Association has had a history of eighteen years, and it has encountered countless intertwined problems. The current situation is due to the fact that, in terms of people, Mr. Wang Rutang, Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Li Fusun, Bei Songsun, Qian Xinzhi, Wu Yunzhai, Shi Liangcai, Xu Xinliu, Hu Mengjia, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jiqing, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, (not all of them are listed), are keen on public welfare and have made continuous efforts; in terms of things, they have adopted the principle of justice and fairness, equal rights and obligations, and taken honest actions, seeking cooperation between Chinese and foreign taxpayers without prejudice to sovereignty, in order to enable the citizens within the boundary to obtain the happiness that human beings should have under the rule of law of the Municipal Council. With eighteen years of experience, the Association deeply feels that equal cooperation is not only a matter of municipal administration, but that all problems can be solved easily and that it is necessary.

<h3>Yesterday was New Year's Day, the Whole City Celebrated Vigorously with Flags; Commemoration of the Founding of the Republic of China; Citizens' Enthusiasm was Extremely High; Actively Promoting "One Dollar to Repay the Debt"</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, New Year's Day. All sectors of the city celebrated with flags. Banks, customs, post offices, public organizations, schools, etc., all followed the custom of taking a holiday. Shops posted signs that read "National Calendar New Year's Day, Closed for One Day." The citizens' enthusiasm was extremely high. All sectors continued the "Economize to Rescue" movement to help refugees and support the government to achieve victory in the war of resistance and complete national reconstruction. The "One Dollar to Repay the Debt" movement also began yesterday, aiming to fulfill the citizens' duty, strengthen the belief of international friendly nations in our aid, and so on. Some school staff and students, as well as public organization members, took advantage of the New Year's holiday to visit various refugee shelters and express their condolences to the refugees who were displaced by the war.</p>
<h3>Banks Have Been on Vacation for Four Days Since Yesterday; Catching Up on Closing Accounts; Because the Market is Lively and Developing Abnormally; All Loans Issued After the War Can Be Recovered</h3>
<p>After the member banks of the Shanghai Banking Association completed the annual closing accounts for the 27th year, they have been on vacation since yesterday, a total of four days. Internally, they are still working as usual, and extending the time to catch up on the closing accounts for the past year. It is expected to open for business on the 5th. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency met a financial leader yesterday. According to the talk, after the war in Shanghai, factories and companies operating national goods businesses in the concessions were forced to stop work due to factories in the inland, while order was restored in the concessions, and the people avoiding Shanghai increased sharply. And the traffic in the inland gradually restored, so that the goods produced tend to be more than supply. The original stocks have been sold out, and increase production day and night. This abnormal development is really beyond the expectations of the general public. Because the market is lively, the loans issued by various banks can be recovered as scheduled. There are absolutely no bad debts in the new loans issued after the war. Therefore, all banks can obtain considerable surplus after the closing accounts.</p>
<h3>Customs Brokerage Firms and Companies Registration Procedures; Customs Notice Regulations</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs has re-handled the registration of customs brokerage firms and companies. The Customs Commissioner Luo Fude had issued the No. 1636 notice. According to the Jianghai Customs, Qiu Weiqi, the deputy commissioner of the General Affairs Department of the Customs, has issued the No. 95 notice, saying that all customs brokerage firms and companies registered with the Customs should re-register at the registration office of the Department from January 1 to January 31, 28th year of the Republic of China.

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Approved by the Ministry of Finance; The Guizhou Province's Salaries and Donations are Only Collected Once</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance stated that according to the telegram from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the procedures for collecting provincial taxes in Guizhou Province are cumbersome, and merchants and the people do not know what to do, please find a way, etc. The Ministry immediately forwarded a letter to the Guangxi Provincial Government to check and reply that the Guizhou Province Salaries and Donations Bureau is located in Wuzhou, and the branch bureau is located in the whole county. All goods entering from Wuzhou are collected by the General Bureau, and those entering from the whole county are collected by the branch bureau. Only one collection is levied, which is implemented throughout the province without any hindrance. Since the implementation, merchants and the people have found it convenient, etc. The Ministry has approved and instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to be informed.</p>
<h3>The Export of Chinese Tea is Quite Good; According to the Report of Mr. Duo Chun; The Sales of Japanese Tea Have Decreased Sharply</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance's Trade Adjustment Council implemented the control over the foreign trade of national black and green tea, it has achieved quite good results. According to the report of Mr. Wei Chun, the tea expert and consultant of the China Tea Company, according to the statistics of the World Tea Committee in London on the tea of various countries in the world, the data on China and Japan are as follows: From January to September of this year (last year), the sales of Chinese tea in various countries in the world reached 65,620,000 pounds, a decrease of only more than one million pounds compared with 66,676,600 pounds in the same period last year (the year before last). The sales of Japanese tea in the world market from January to September this year were only 21,643,000 pounds, a decrease of almost half compared with 38,852,000 pounds in the same period last year.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Issued a Circular; Strictly Prohibiting the Use of Coins; The Handling Fee for Collection and Exchange Increased to 15%; The Provincial Governments Should Declare the Government's Virtuous Intentions</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance telegraphed to the provincial governments, saying that since the implementation of the legal currency, all payments and receipts of grain taxes and all public and private funds are limited to the legal currency, and cash is not allowed to be used. The Ministry issued a notice in November 24th year, and telegraphed to the municipal governments to follow it. At the same time, the Measures for Exchanging Legal Currency was promulgated, so that those who hold silver coins can exchange them for legal currency nearby, in order to unify. Our country is vast, and transportation is often inconvenient. There are still a few remote areas that use coins. Now, the Executive Yuan issued the proposal of the members of the National Political Council's first conference, Xu Baiyuan, etc., and clearly prohibited the use of coins in the second item of the third clause. If there are still people using coins as a medium of exchange in the inland, it should be expressly prohibited and ordered to be implemented. In order to collect silver coins and silver, and enrich the preparations, the Ministry has sent a letter to the joint office of the four banks of China, China, Communication, and Agriculture, and transferred it to the four banks. In the future, the handling fee for collecting and exchanging silver coins and silver will be increased to 15% (that is, for every 100 yuan collected and exchanged, a handling fee of 15 yuan will be given as an incentive. It is intended to promote the collection and exchange, and still benefit the people. It should be declared by the provincial and municipal governments the virtuous intentions of the government, and announce to the people that the use of coins is strictly prohibited. Those who hold silver coins and silver should quickly hand them over to the branches of the four banks of China, China, Communication, and Agriculture, or their entrusted agencies, to exchange them for legal currency for use, in order to purify the currency policy.</p>
<h3>Establishing a Southwest Economic Construction Committee; Engaging in the Development of Rich Resources; The Mineral Reserves in the Six Provinces are Very Rich; Inconvenient Transportation and Backward Industry are the Main Reasons</h3>
<p>The Chinese government established the Southwest Economic Construction Committee to develop and construct the southwest and enhance the strength of the war of resistance. The relevant ministers and the chairmen of the southwest provinces were appointed as members. The preparations have been completed and the committee will be established in Chongqing on New Year's Day of the 28th year. In addition to the government's allocation of huge funds as capital, Hu Wenhu invested 50 million yuan, and the banks decided to assist in the completion. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Agriculture</p>
<p>The total area of the six provinces is 260 million mu, and the cultivated area is 31.7 million mu, accounting for 15% of the total area. The situation in each province is the highest in Guangxi, accounting for 25%, and the lowest in Xuenan, accounting for 4%. Other provinces such as Guangdong account for 12%, Hunan accounts for 13%, Guizhou accounts for 8%, and Sichuan accounts for 15%. The main agricultural product is rice, with indica and japonica rice accounting for 47% of the national output. Among them, Guangdong Province ranks first, Sichuan Province ranks second, and Hunan Province ranks third. Although silk and tea are specialties of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, the southwest provinces are far behind. However, the silk of Sichuan and Guangdong, and the tea of Hunan and Yunnan are also quite famous. In addition, an important agricultural product that can be mentioned is tung oil. The annual output of Sichuan Province alone has increased to 600,000 dan. The cotton production is very small. Sichuan has 750,000 dan, Hunan has 400,000 dan, and Guangdong has only 6,000 dan.</p>
<p>Industry</p>
<p>Due to the competition from foreign goods and foreign factories, the industrial foundation is extremely weak. This situation is even more true in the southwest provinces. Although there are few foreigners who set up factories in these six provinces, the competition from imported foreign goods is very fierce. The main reason for the industrial backwardness in the southwest provinces is the backwardness of transportation. The supply of raw materials and the circulation of products are inconvenient, so it is difficult for industry to gain a foothold. The largest modern industry is the yarn factory. There are only two in the southwest, namely the Guangdong Textile Factory and the Hunan First Textile Factory. The newly established ones are the Hunan Hengzhong Textile Company, the Sichuan Jiabin Textile Factory, and the Yunnan Textile Factory. The flour mills are the Hunan First Factory in Changsha and the Changde Xinxin Flour Mill. However, sugar mills are more developed, but they are also limited to Sichuan and Guangdong provinces. Alcohol factories are mainly in Guangdong and Guangxi, and Hunan and Sichuan are also planning. Sichuan has the most match factories, with a total of 46 factories, Hunan and Guangxi each have one factory, Guangdong has 15 factories, and Yunnan has 18 factories. In addition, there are a total of 200 factories for papermaking, leather making, silk reeling, sulfuric acid, salt making, rubber, cement, and machinery.</p>
<p>Mining Industry</p>
<p>The southwest provinces have all kinds of mineral deposits, and the reserves are very rich, including gold, silver, steel, iron, tin, tungsten, manganese, antimony, zinc, lead, coal, petroleum, and salt. In particular, tin, tungsten, manganese, and antimony mines occupy a very high position in the world. However, coal and iron are not as prosperous as the northern provinces. (1) Iron ore reserves of 39,616,000 tons, (2) Coal reserves of 1,553,500,000 tons, (3) Manganese annual output of 31,200 tons, (4) Tungsten annual output of 1,825 tons, (5) Gold annual output of 31,206 taels, (6) Silver annual output of 121,504 taels, (7) Zinc annual output of 11,410 tons, (8) Tin annual output of 7,398 tons, (9) Antimony annual output of about 13,260 tons, (10) Lead annual output of 6,670 tons, (11) Bismuth annual output of 1,305 tons, (12) Petroleum annual output of 400 barrels.</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>The railway money in the six provinces is not enough and lacks connections, and other means of transportation have not reached perfection. Therefore, if you want to develop the rich resources of the southwest, you should first engage in construction. (1) Railways: The railways that the government has recently started to construct are the Sichuan Xufu to Yunnan Kunming Sichuan-Yunnan Railway, the Yunnan Kunming to British Burma Yunnan-Burma Railway, the Hunan Zhuzhou to Guizhou Guiyang Hunan-Guizhou Railway, and the Guizhou Guiyang to Yunnan Kunming Yunnan-Guizhou Railway. Those in the plan include the Sichuan-Kang, Gui-Yue, Gui-Qian, Guangdong-Gui, Baoji-Chengdu, etc. (2) Highways: The southwest highways are more developed than other provinces. The six provinces have a total of 27,000 kilometers of roads that can be used for traffic, accounting for a quarter of the country, such as the Gan-Dian Road, Chuan-Gui Road, Gui-Min Road, Xiang-Gui Road, Chuan-Xiang Road, Chuan-Dian Road, Yue-Gan Road, E-Xiang Road, Xiang-E Road, Gua-Dian Road, Shaan-Kang Road, Gui-Yue Road, Chuan-E Road, etc. The recently completed one is the Dian-Mian Road.</p>
<h3>The Banking Industry Received a Telegram from the Ministry; The Contract for Receiving Vouchers is Approved for Extension; If the Situation is Stable, a Notice Can Be Given to End Early; 50% of the Principal and Interest of the Central China Loan Can Be Used to Offset the Amount Received</h3>
<p>The banks and money houses have received the vouchers from the four banks of China, China, Communication, and Agriculture. After the Ministry of Finance ordered to end them after the expiration of the period, they were changed to the method of pledging funds and redeeming them in installments. The Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Association, after consultation, believed that due to the actual difficulties, the Ministry was telegraphed to request maintenance of finance and further extension. The reporter learned from the banking industry yesterday that the two industry associations have received a telegram from the Ministry, saying that the difficulties stated in the telegram are still true. The Ministry has approved the four banks of China, China, Communication, and Agriculture to reluctantly extend the period for another year according to the original amount. The period will not be extended again after the expiration. However, if the situation is stable and the bond market is stable during this one-year period, the issuing bank can notify the voucher receiving bank to end early two months in advance. The voucher receiving bank can also send a letter to the issuing bank two months in advance to agree to end early. The principal of the guaranteed preparation bond, which is drawn, will still be collected by the issuing bank in full according to the extension method of the previous year to offset the same amount of receipts. The interest on the bond will be collected by the issuing bank to offset the same amount of receipts, and the remaining half will still be received by the voucher receiving bank, so as to take both into account. In addition to the letter to the branches of the four joint headquarters, the relevant parties are requested to be informed and transferred to negotiate.</p>

<h3>China's Foreign Trade; The Import Surplus Has Sharply Decreased in Recent Years; Gradually Improved After the Adjustment of the Trade Council; Promoting Exports to Make the Foreign Exchange Base Solid</h3>

<h3>Municipal Group Fundraising Committee, Broadcasting Conference Closed Last Night, The Seven-Day Conference Achieved Good Results, Fundraising Teams Continue Fundraising Work</h3>
<p>The broadcasting fundraising conference organized by the Municipal Group Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has ended as scheduled and was declared closed last night. Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Liu Zhongying, and others delivered closing speeches, expressing gratitude to all sectors. The seven-day conference achieved very good fundraising results. Each fundraising team will continue fundraising work from today. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>End of Broadcasting, Continued Fundraising</p>
<p>Yesterday was the last day of the association's broadcasting fundraising. Due to the damage to the Xinxin Radio Station's equipment, the event was temporarily moved to the China-West Radio Station and broadcast jointly by major radio stations. The program included Suzhou Tanci, storytelling, and flower-world schoolgirls. All famous flowers from the city's northern district were mobilized to participate, displaying their beautiful voices and doing their utmost to raise funds. Leaders who gave speeches on the radio yesterday included Wang Wanbai, Zhou Bangjun, Jiang Yiping, and Zhu Qizhen. At 12 o'clock last night, association chairman Yu Qiaqing, municipal group chairman Lin Kanghou, and general manager Liu Zhongying delivered closing speeches and immediately declared the conference closed. During the seven-day conference, the enthusiasm of all sectors in adopting refugees was consistently high, resulting in very good adoption results. Accurate and detailed figures are still awaiting statistics from the association for publication. It is vaguely heard that the adoption funds from all sectors have indeed exceeded 100,000 yuan. Furthermore, the association has established 50 fundraising teams, and the second step is to promote these fundraising teams. It is heard that work will begin soon.</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing and Others Deliver Closing Speeches</p>
<p>At 12 o'clock last night, association chairman Yu Qiaqing delivered a closing speech, expressing deep gratitude to all sectors for supporting the relief work. Municipal group chairman Lin Kanghou delivered a closing speech, stating that this association held a broadcasting fundraising conference to promote the refugee adoption movement. It was fortunate to have all major radio stations in the city generously provide their facilities, and the stations' staff generously allowed programs, as well as all the city's opera stars, celebrities, members of the film industry, performing arts circles, and famous flowers from the northern district, to participate in broadcasting special programs. Leaders of the performing arts circles took turns giving reports daily, joining in the good cause and benefiting the disaster victims. This is greatly admired. All the philanthropists generously donated and enthusiastically participated in the adoption movement. After the donation statistics are completed, a separate notice will be published in the newspaper to express thanks. For now, on behalf of the refugees, I extend my deepest gratitude. General Manager Liu Zhongying's speech focused on the following points: (1) A total thank you for the continuous generous donations from philanthropists from all sectors and the enthusiastic support for the broadcasting conference during the seven days of the broadcasting conference. (2) The refugee adoption donations are extremely complex. Some adopt for one year, some for half a year, some for three months, and some until the shelter closes. As for the donations, some have been paid in full at once, and some are paid in installments. Statistics are currently being compiled separately. Once the statistics are completed, the association will publish them in the newspaper. If there are any errors, please notify us for correction. (3) The commemorative badges for philanthropists who adopt refugees, as well as the names and origins of the adopted refugees, are now also being compiled. Once the procedures are completed, they will be sent or notified for collection. (4) Adopting refugees is a more widespread and long-lasting relief method because saving two yuan per month can save one refugee. Most people have the ability to participate in adoption, and the terms are divided into three months, half a year, and one year, so that the adopted refugees can also receive more lasting benefits. Although our association's broadcasting fundraising has come to an end, the fundraising adoption movement will not stop here. We still have 50 fundraising teams to continue working to ensure that all 100,000 refugees in this city have the opportunity to be adopted. Therefore, I sincerely hope that philanthropists from all sectors who have not yet adopted will continue to adopt, and those who have already adopted will persuade their relatives and friends to adopt, and jointly complete this refugee adoption movement. (5) For any inquiries, the association's address is Room 414, Xingye Building, Beijing Road, Jiangxi Road Intersection, telephone number 18533. Furthermore, Zhu Qizhen, a member of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Group, delivered a speech, hoping that all sectors would continue to work hard and complete the adoption movement.</p>
<p>Summary of Previous Speeches</p>
<p>The day before yesterday was the sixth day of the Refugee Relief Association Municipal Group Fundraising Committee. Leaders from all sectors gathered at the Xinxin Radio Station to give speeches. Due to space limitations yesterday, it was not possible to publish all of them. The summary is recorded as follows: Guo Shun's speech stated that wealthy families should slightly reduce their enjoyment consumption, and middle-class people should make appropriate adoptions according to their financial capacity, which will surely have a significant effect, directly saving the suffering compatriots and indirectly cultivating the country's strength. Le Gengbao's speech stated that according to the current situation at sea, places such as bars, hotels, dance halls, and entertainment venues are even more lively than before, but I am not here to oppose them. What I hope is that you will save unnecessary and unwarranted expenses and adopt more refugees, which is truly immeasurable merit. Key points of the speech by Li Ze, General Manager of Xinxin Company: (1) As the war zone expands, funds are being transferred inland to relieve Shanghai refugees, which should be the responsibility of Shanghai citizens. (2) Refugees are victims of disasters for the country. Foreigners are self-rescuing, and Chinese people should work harder. (3) Helping refugees is of great importance and profound significance to the national and social mission. (4) I hope that all sectors, especially fellow villagers, will adopt refugees for the long term. (5) While living and working in peace and contentment, we should also help others. Otherwise, social problems will arise. (Omitted)</p>
<h3>Meida and Tangsai, Two Ships, Permitted to Combine with Wan and Dinghai</h3>
<p>The Hana, Haifu, Shantai, Gaodeng, and Tangbei, five ships operating between Shanghai and Taiwan, Wan, and Dinghai, have been temporarily prohibited from docking due to the handling of ship registration for a long time, and have not been able to resume operations, resulting in the interruption of passenger and cargo transportation. The Meida and Tangsai, two ships operating between Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, and Qian, have been permitted by the authorities to combine with Wan and Dinghai. Therefore, passengers and cargo from Shanghai to Dinghai can now be loaded onto ships operating on the Shanghai-Taiwan route to Haimen and transferred to Meida and Tangsai to Dinghai.

<h3>After the Shanghai Customs Was Seized, Remittances to the Government Were Suspended, No Remittances Have Been Made Since July of Last Year, Tax Rates Were Reduced, and Savings Were Changed to Japanese Banks Under Duress</h3>
<p>Shanghai, with its superior location, convenient transportation, and thriving industry, is the center of trade and the hub of economy in the country, the only major port in the Far East. The import of foreign goods and the export of domestic goods are the best in the country's customs. When the war first broke out, due to the impact of the war, inland transportation was interrupted, resulting in an unusual decline in trade. Now that order has been restored within the concession, trade has also improved. In November of last year, the total value of imports and exports increased to 62,830,407 yuan, while the total value of imports and exports in the country in the same month was 141,400,614 yuan, with Shanghai Customs accounting for nearly one-half. However, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs has been seized by the Japanese since July 1st of last year. Tax rates have been reduced for the import of Japanese goods, and customs revenue has been changed to be deposited in the Japanese Shokin Bank. It was also forced to change the flag to the "Five Colors" pseudo-flag. As for the taxes that Jianghai Customs should remit to the government, apart from the remittance in June of the 27th year of the Republic of China, totaling 1,180,171.65 yuan, no remittances have been made since July, which proves that the Shanghai Jianghai Customs has undoubtedly been seized by the Japanese.</p>

<h3>Norwegian Minister Returns to Shanghai, Will Soon Go to Japan to Resume His Post</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Norwegian Minister Colin, who has served in China and Japan, left Tokyo for Bangkok two months ago at the invitation of the Siamese government to attend the ceremony for the young king's return to the capital. He has recently arrived in Shanghai from Bangkok and is expected to stay in Shanghai for a week and meet with Norwegian expatriates in this port. According to those who met with Colin yesterday (31st), he jokingly said that he represents Norway in China and Japan, and some people make fun of him for this, but he always has a prepared answer for this, that is, Norway is completely neutral. Colin is returning to Tokyo to resume his post, but he is quite happy to have an opportunity to meet old friends in Shanghai again. According to Colin, his first decision to come to the Far East was during the Russo-Japanese War, the second was during World War I, and this decision came shortly before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, Colin told people that he has come to the Far East twice, and each time there has been a war.</p>
<h3>Former Russian Customs Commissioner in Beiping Released After Arrest, Will Come to Shanghai on Japanese Ship on the 4th</h3>
<p>Mr. Yanuofanlev, a Russian expatriate who has held important positions in the Chinese Customs and served as an advisor to the Ministry of Finance, and is now promoted to Customs Commissioner of Beiping Customs, still lives in Beiping after resigning. He was suddenly detained by the puppet organization of North China on December 22. The reason for his arrest, initially rumored, was resistance to the order of the North China White Russian Anti-Communist Alliance, as he was unwilling to pay the taxes forcibly levied by the North China White Russian Anti-Communist Alliance. According to the nephew of Canovanlev (his nephew works for the Shanghai Far East Export Company), he received a telegram from his uncle in Tianjin yesterday stating that he has fortunately been released and will take the Tangshan Maru ship of the Nisshin Company to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 29th. The ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 4th or 5th of this month. In the near future, he may travel to Europe. It is heard that Canovanlev's release was due to his nephew writing to the North China Customs authorities in Shanghai requesting special negotiations.</p>
<h3>British Rear Admiral Holt Visits the Commander of the Merchant Corps</h3>
<p>The Chinese-English newspaper reported that British Rear Admiral Holt of the Yangtze River Fleet formally visited Colonel Hang Pei, Commander of the Shanghai International Merchant Corps, before 11:00 yesterday (31st). A squad of the White Russian team of the International Merchant Corps formed a guard of honor and lined up at the Public Works Department. According to reports, Rear Admiral Holt has been stationed on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River for more than 16 months and returned to Shanghai from Hankou on the HMS Mantis on December 24.</p>
<h3>Wangdian Post Office in Zhejiang Resumes Business Yesterday, Limited to Ordinary Express Letters and Registration for the Time Being</h3>
<p>The Wangdian Third-Class B-Level Post Office along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has been prepared since the Zhejiang Postal Administration and the Shanghai Postal Administration jointly handled the resumption of business. It was decided to resume business yesterday, limited to ordinary, express, and registered mail. Small parcels are also accepted up to 6 kilograms. As for remittances and large parcels, they are still being prepared. Once negotiations are completed, they can be accepted.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Protects Slave Girls, Principles Passed, Does Not Recognize Slave Girl Status, and Pays Attention to Buying and Selling Transfers</h3>
<p>Keeping slave girls is opposed by the international community. Due to long-standing habits in China, many middle and upper-class families still keep maids. The Public Works Department of the Public Concession believes that this matter is related to humanity, so it has established a Child Protection Section, and hired Ms. Xinder, Director of the Factory Affairs Section, to serve concurrently as the section chief and also as the protector of slave girls, in order to rescue servants and respect humanity. After repeated research, and with the approval of the Board of Directors, two principles of protection have been formulated: (1) The Bureau should, in accordance with the increasingly developed concept in other places, not recognize the status of slave girls, or any status similar to slavery. (This principle implies that slave girls should not be registered separately.) (2) The Bureau should also, as in other places, pay serious attention to children and young people who are transferred, and use all possible means to ensure that the transfer is reported to the Bureau's responsible personnel, and try to protect the transferred person, in order to show the Bureau's sense of responsibility.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Pudong Patrol at Night, Suddenly Ambushed by Chinese Troops, Fierce Battle for Two Hours, Chinese Troops Retreat to the Southeast</h3>
<p>On the evening of the lunar New Year's Eve (i.e., the night before), at 8:00 p.m., a fierce guerrilla warfare occurred near Nanyangjing Bridge, south of Yangjing Town, Pudong. The Japanese troops were ambushed and suffered heavy casualties. At that time, a platoon of the Third Battalion of the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in Yangjing, numbering about 20 or 30 people, patrolled near Nanyangjing Bridge at night and was suddenly ambushed and surrounded by 70 or 80 Chinese guerrillas. A fierce battle raged in the dark for an hour. The villagers there were extremely panicked. The number of Japanese casualties is unknown, but it is known that very few escaped. Subsequently, the Third Battalion headquarters near the Fujia Catholic Church urgently dispatched 70 or 80 reinforcements in four trucks to Nanyangjing Bridge for retaliation. The two sides fought fiercely again for a while, and the Chinese troops retreated to the southeast. The Japanese troops were furious and arrested the villagers who were walking at night, interrogating them one by one. Those with fake "citizen certificates" were detained until midnight before being released. More than ten civilians without "certificates" were identified as guerrillas and taken back to the battalion headquarters together for severe beatings and interrogations. The outcome is unknown.</p>
<h3>Japanese Puppets Closed the Traffic on the Huangpu River Yesterday</h3>
<p>Recently, Chinese guerrilla troops in the suburbs of Shanghai have been exceptionally active and have launched attacks from time to time, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese troops. Because yesterday was the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, the Japanese puppets were afraid that the brave Chinese guerrillas would take the opportunity to attack, so they temporarily closed the traffic on the Huangpu River yesterday. All ships to and from Nanmatou, Damatou, Pudong, the Concession, Wusong, Gaoqiao, and other areas were suspended. It has not yet been decided whether they will be able to sail today.</p>

<h3>The Concession Authorities Strictly Prevent Gambling and Opium; Long-Term Blockade of the Western Shanghai Area; Traffic Around Gambling Dens is Completely Blocked; Smuggling of Drugs Gradually Disappears</h3>
<p>The authorities of the Public Concession, seeing that opium dens and gambling tables were rampant in western Shanghai, and robberies were rampant, specially constructed barbed wire obstacles at various entrances and exits to cut off traffic and maintain law and order. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Blocking Gambling Dens</p>
<p>In the extra-settlement road area of western Shanghai, there are no fewer than dozens of large and small gambling tables. Hooligans and gangsters frequently enter and exit, resulting in a loss of discipline and unrest. Robberies and extortion with bombs are also endless. Nearby residents often suffer. Now, during the Lunar New Year, merchants routinely collect debts, and traffic is frequent, making this place a dreaded route. In view of this, the police authorities, in order to cut off the traffic to the gambling dens, specially erected barbed wire and other obstacles at the entrances of various roads and lanes in the adjacent extra-settlement areas, blocking the surroundings of the gambling dens so that they could not directly reach the concession. Only narrow passages were left at important entrances and exits, allowing pedestrians to pass sideways. Armed detectives are dispatched daily to patrol in shifts. Anyone with suspicious behavior is searched. Strict enforcement in recent days has been quite effective. The gambling dens have become desolate, and many are in a state of having few visitors.</p>
<p>Eliminating Drug Trafficking</p>
<p>After the opium public sale was implemented in the suburbs of Shanghai, the Japanese puppet regime often secretly transported drugs through the concession for convenience of transportation, with the extra-settlement road area of western Shanghai as a necessary route. The matter was discovered by the concession authorities, who strictly blocked the area and cut off important traffic, adding barbed wire and the like to prevent cars from passing. Drug trafficking cases have indeed disappeared. Now, the concession authorities have resolved to block the western Shanghai area for a long time to prevent the spread of drug flames and affect the concession.</p>
<h3>Le Jia Old Shop, Beijing Shuren Hall, Grand Opening</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of Beijing Tongrentang Le Jia Old Shop Shuren Hall Pharmacy, located at 751 Nanjing Road, officially opened yesterday. Hundreds of guests from all walks of life arrived and were warmly greeted and given a tour by the hall. On display were acupuncture bronze figures, a full set of monkey bones, precious yellow-haired deer antlers, high-quality ginseng, top-grade donkey-hide gelatin, and other items transported from the Beijing headquarters, a dazzling array. The hall also announced to the guests that it adheres to the consistent principle of Beijing Tongrentang, selling various pills, powders, plasters, and elixirs, all from secret recipes, carefully prepared and refined, with genuine goods at fair prices, being realistic and pragmatic, and never being false. It is also heard that Mr. Le Shusun, the manager of the hall, also serves as the manager of Beijing Tongrentang, presiding over all important matters. Due to inconvenient transportation, he could not come to thank the guests in person, expressing his apologies. Afterwards, all the guests were invited to the second floor for tea and refreshments, crowded and lively, a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Opening of Hongkou, Negotiations Continue; Japanese Side Agrees to Restore Part First; Implemented from March 1st This Year</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of opening the northeast area of Hongkou, which has been under negotiation for more than a year, representatives of the Public Works Department met with the Japanese military on Wednesday of last week to discuss everything. The Japanese side has agreed to tentatively open the area within the scope of Broadway Road to Tilanqiao from March 1st this year, with the Public Works Department handling registration procedures and issuing residence permits. The police force under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department will also be responsible for security. If the situation after the opening is good, further discussions will be held on the method of restoring full police powers. The area of the pilot opening is not large, and the Yangshupu, Hansbury Road, Wusong Road, and North Sichuan Road areas are not included. However, the negotiations that have been deadlocked for several months have been opened up by this change. Representatives from both sides have also scheduled to continue negotiations from the 5th of this month.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Race Club to Hold Three Consecutive Days of Races Starting Today; New Year Grand Champion Tickets to be Drawn the Day After Tomorrow; Ticket Sales Outlets Added During Races; No Admission Tickets Required to Purchase</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Race Club's New Year Grand Prix will begin today and will be held for three days. There will be eight races today, and nine races each tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. The program is wonderful and rare in previous sessions. The most anticipated is the seventh Grand Champion race on the day after tomorrow. The New Year Grand Champion tickets, since their release, have been selling very well due to their simple procedures and excellent methods. Each full ticket has eleven strips and costs ten yuan in national currency. Retail price is one yuan per strip. The club, considering that those who want to buy Grand Champion tickets during the races are often inconvenienced by the restriction that "admission tickets are required to enter the venue," has specially set up a ticket sales office at the archway of the club at 304A Mahe Road (opposite the gate on Route Mandalane) during the races for convenience, which also sells the Grand Champion tickets to benefit all sectors of society. The time is from 11:30 am to 4:30 pm today and tomorrow, and from 11:30 am to 2:00 pm the day after tomorrow. At other times, the lottery ticket department of the club at 304 Mahe Road will continue to sell them as usual.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Supply is Abundant and Prices are Slightly Lower than Before</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of vegetables at the 16th Pier, Laozha Bridge, and other places in Shanghai was abundant, so prices were slightly lower than in the previous few days. Chinese cabbage (commonly known as bok choy) was 1.40 yuan per 100 jin (market weight), Taihu radish was 1.70 yuan per 100 jin, spinach was 3.50 yuan per 100 jin, collapse vegetables were 4 yuan per 100 jin, and yellow sprouts (also known as gelatinous vegetables) were 5 yuan per 100 jin. However, Chinese cabbage and radish still sell for four or five cents per jin in the small vegetable market.</p>

<h3>Citizens' Group Standing Committee Suggests: Requesting Real Estate Owners to Contribute to Disaster Relief; Standard: 1% of Monthly Rent; Term: Please Limit to Three Months</h3>
<p>Li Jinzhang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Citizens' Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, suggested yesterday: "Respected Sir, there is no better way to raise funds for refugee relief than through real estate. It is estimated that there are at least 500,000 houses in the two special districts of Shanghai. The current development of the real estate industry is unprecedented since Shanghai became a commercial port. It is proposed that landlords deduct 1% of the monthly rent, for a period of three months, that is, deducting one yuan for every 100 yuan of rent, as expenses for refugee relief. This is like a hair from an ox for the landlords, but accumulating sand into a tower. The standing committee of this association can notify all tenants, that is, second landlords, to pay in advance on a monthly basis, and the association will issue receipts (it is best to pay in one lump sum) to be deducted when the rent is paid each month. The collection method will be to have the association specially dispatch several collectors with photo identification and badges, and use two-part receipts with stamps as receipts, and report to the court and police department for record, to avoid misunderstandings. At the same time, in the current state, eight out of ten are second landlords, so whether we are subletting the remaining house, please each tenant donate one yuan when paying rent to the second landlord, but only for one month. This small amount is not a significant burden for the payer, and the refugees will benefit greatly. This is my humble opinion, please make a public decision."</p>
<p>Shipping Companies Pay for Refugees</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal for the shipping industry in this city to contribute to refugee relief, the shipping industry association invited various shipping companies to a meeting and decided to pay a 1% donation from salaries, and then allocate 5/1000 from business (ie, income from passenger and freight fares) to be used for this purpose. This method was decided to be implemented from November, with a limit of one year. Currently, the shipping companies that have successively arrived in November to pay this business contribution donation include: Zhengde Company's Shantai Wheel, Hualun Foreign Company's Glen, Batula, Enji, Haida, Carrie, Dapu, Pina, Liwuduo, Oleve Wheel, Lihe Foreign Company's Moufu, Haifu Wheel, Yihua Foreign Company's Baoli Wheel, Meili Company's Meifa, Meida Wheel, Far East Company's Hana Wheel, Huamei Company's Tang Wheel Department, Sino-Italian Company's Deping, Ende, Kangshayi Wheel, and Taichang Foreign Company, Shanghai Company, Dongli Company, Changyun Company, Far East Shipping Company, etc. The association has reported to the Refugee Relief Association to publish a thank you notice. Others who have not yet paid include Lulin Foreign Company's Gaodeng, Feikang Wheel, Atlantic Company's Hailong Wheel, Haibi Foreign Company's Lisha, Kaisideng Wheel, Wanguo Shipping Company's Xinde, Minhe, Lude, Wanguo, Baode Wheel, Ke Company, Haikang, Luan Wheel, Qierli Foreign Company's Lima, Paide Wheel, etc. The shipping industry association is currently sending separate letters to urge payment.</p>
<p>Hardware Association Sends Donations</p>
<p>The Hardware and Parts Industry Association of this city sent a letter to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association yesterday, saying: "Respected Sir, the association has collected refugee donations from the industry for December, which have been collected in full, including salary 1/100 contribution from 25 households totaling 81 yuan and 4 cents, and monthly donations from 35 households totaling 300 yuan, totaling 381 yuan and 4 cents. It was paid to the Nanjing Road branch of Siming Bank on December 27, and a receipt number 1219 was obtained and stored in the association.

(Another message) Hua Fengtai Hardware Store raised 120 yuan in national currency from Mr. Lu Donghou, which has been notified to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association by Mr. Wang Yuanzhang, executive committee member of the Hardware Industry Association, asking them to collect it from Mr. Lu with a formal receipt as soon as possible."</p>

Mr. Mao and others expressed great sympathy for the relief of refugees and have agreed to work hard to raise funds from the industry and have properly determined the fundraising methods, which will be implemented soon.</p>
<p>A Certain Lady Photographs with Refugees</p>
<p>A certain lady, in view of the suffering of the refugees and the seriousness of the relief association's work, volunteered to sponsor 50 refugees, at two yuan per person, totaling 100 yuan per month, temporarily for a period of one year, totaling 1,200 yuan. However, she requested to take a photo with the 50 refugees she sponsored. It is heard that the association is deeply impressed by the enthusiasm of the lady and can arrange the photography. Once the photography is completed, the lady's name and address will be announced to arouse social sympathy.</p>
<p>Chen Jilin's Birthday Celebrations Aid Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Jilin, former director and acting consul of the Overseas Chinese Association in Hamburg, Germany, has been engaged in charitable activities since returning to China after resigning from his position, sparing no effort in his support. On the 27th of last month, on the occasion of his sixty-second birthday, his relatives and friends Yu Qiaqing, Huang Jinrong, Jin Tingsun, Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Jiguang, Kuai Yanfang, Zhu Meixian, Fang Jiaobo, and others specially initiated birthday celebrations. However, Mr. Chen, considering the severity of the national crisis, did not dare to make a show and, seeing the pitiful situation of the refugees in Shanghai, added all the birthday gifts sent by his relatives and friends to the banquet expenses, and transferred them all to charitable causes, totaling 5,500 yuan, which has been handed over to Mr. Jin Tingsun in full, asking him to forward it to the Refugee Relief Association and various charitable organizations.</p>

<h3>A Japanese Military Officer Burned to Death; Military Motorcycle Caught Fire</h3>
<p>The English-language North China Daily News reported that a Japanese military officer was burned to death in the sidecar of a military motorcycle in the Huishan district this morning (1st). This is the first fatal tragedy of the New Year. The Huishan police station is currently investigating, but the Japanese military authorities have obtained all the details. The vehicle suddenly caught fire on Dongxi Huade Road, Yuanfang Road, immediately spreading to the sidecar, and a Japanese military officer sitting in the sidecar was unable to escape and was burned. As of press time, the results of the police investigation were still unknown. The vehicle has been identified as number 16.</p>
<h3>A Car Crushes a Merchant to Death; A Dung Cart Driver</h3>
<p>Wang Azeng, a native of Suzhou, who was over fifty years old, made a living pulling a dung cart. At about 5:00 am yesterday morning, Wang was pulling his cart near Suzhou Road and Zhejiang Road when a black-plated car, number 12231, suddenly sped over. Wang was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked to the ground, suffering severe head injuries and on the verge of death. The patrol officer number 1709 from the Laozha police station rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, recorded the license plate number of the car that caused the accident, and urgently took the injured person to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died at noon.</p>
<h3>Sale of Broadway Mansion Fails</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that, according to information obtained yesterday (31st), the rumors that the British business Guangye Company has sold the Broadway Mansion to the Japanese are not true. It is said that the negotiations for the sale of the mansion were based on 5.5 million yuan in cash, or 3 million yuan in cash, with the remainder to be paid within a time limit. However, the transaction was not successfully negotiated, and there is reason to believe that the negotiations have failed.</p>
<h3>Avenue Joffre Renovation; Shops Must All Install Show Windows; New Licenses Valid for the First Half of the Year</h3>
<p>The French Concession authorities, in order to enhance the appearance of Avenue Joffre, have specially stipulated that, from January 1, 1939, all shops on the section from Route Ghisi to Route Hogue must be renovated with Western-style show window facades. The procedures to be adopted are: (1) For newly established stores, the store owner must install Western-style show windows on the facade of each store before being allowed to obtain a business license. (2) For existing stores, the business license they should obtain for 1939 will be valid for only six months (ie, from January 1, 1939, to June 30). During these six months, each store must find a way to renovate appropriate and beautiful show windows. If the facade is not renovated after June 30, the business license will not be renewed from July 1. After the implementation of this method, it is expected that the beautiful appearance of Avenue Joffre will be realized in half a year.</p>

<h3>Coal Gas Pipe Explodes; Worker Poisoned to Death; Wu Guixiang Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>Wu Linxiang, a young worker aged 19, who lived at 28 Gaoshou Lane, Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession, was a coppersmith at the Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory at 20 Route Masnan in the French Concession. From 17:00 on December 30th of last year, while working in the factory workshop, the installed natural gas pipe, due to years of corrosion, exploded, causing the coal gas to spill out, filling the room with a foul smell. Wu happened to be nearby and was poisoned by the coal gas, fainting and falling to the ground, unconscious. Chen Shouan, a Shaoxing native and colleague, discovered this and told the accounting room of the pharmaceutical factory, who sent Wu to Guangci Hospital. Due to severe poisoning, treatment was ineffective, and he died at 2:00 pm the next afternoon. The hospital reported to the police, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was sent to the Tongren Fugai branch for examination. Due to the New Year's holiday, a report will be made to the court on the 4th for inspection before coffin burial.</p>
<h3>Two Opium Dens Raided on Ningxing Street</h3>
<p>The French Concession police authorities, at about 10:00 am yesterday, ordered Chinese and French detectives to raid an opium den at the entrance of Baoyu Lane, 104 Ningxing Street, on the second floor of the Lin Juxing Rice Cake Shop. The den owner, Little Suzhou, had already escaped, and only four opium smokers, two opium dealers, two opium pipes, seventy or eighty opium bubbles, and opium ash were seized. They then went to the front building and raided another house, arresting the deaf monk couple who owned the house, four opium smokers, and opium lamps and pipes, and brought the people and evidence to the police station to be sent to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Mutton Dealers Raise Prices</h3>
<p>The mutton dealers in this city have seen transportation difficulties and transportation difficulties recently, resulting in a shortage of sources and increased prices. In order to maintain their capital, the association convened the industry and unanimously decided to increase prices by three cities from New Year's Day yesterday. Long-term contract customers should understand the difficulties of the business and add accordingly to avoid losses. The retail department also sold all mutton at 5 jiao per jin in national currency from yesterday. Dealers must not lower prices, and those who violate the regulations will be punished accordingly.</p>
<h3>Five Sons, Only Wants the Fourth Son to Support; Father, Brothers, Mother, and Son in Court; Persuasion Ineffective, Continued Hearing Scheduled</h3>
<p>Cao Wenyu, a local residing at 5 Sanchengfang, Maibaige Road, who works at Taichang Company, whose father Cao Yuxiang is seventy years old and has five sons, Wenyu is the fourth, and has a young son Jin Gen, who was born to his stepmother Shen, the parents abandoned the elder two, three, and other three sons, and did not ask for support, but filed a lawsuit against Wenyu alone, requesting a ruling to pay 2,550 yuan in legal tender for support fees before November 27, and 50 yuan per month for support fees after November, and requested litigation assistance and exemption from litigation fees. After being sued, Wenyu, based on the fact that his old father and stepmother's claims about his economic situation were greatly exaggerated and not true, hired lawyer Jiang Chiping to submit a defense, stating that the plaintiff's claim that he lived extravagantly and possessed huge assets was not true. He once suffered the pain of unemployment, and then worked at Taichang Company, with a monthly salary of 50 yuan, which was only enough to barely maintain his daily life, and he has no savings to this day. As for the claim that he profited from transporting food, it is even more unfounded. Although he once jointly invested with a friend to purchase wheat, the result was a loss of several hundred yuan. The living expenses of his father have always been shared by his brothers. He initially paid 5 yuan per month, and from January of this year, increased it to 10 yuan, without interruption. Now his father listens to the slander of his stepmother Shen and others, and is fooled by others, resulting in a family dispute caused by instigation and alienation, which is deeply regrettable. Since he has never interrupted his father's living expenses, how can there be any abandonment? As for Shen, she is actually his father's mistress, and Jin Gen is Shen's illegitimate child, so they have always rented a house outside and lived separately and have never lived with him. According to Article 1114 of the Civil Code, Shen and Jin Gen have no right to claim alimony. These people know that they cannot file a lawsuit for alimony because they do not have family status, so they do not hesitate to instigate the old father to file a lawsuit, trying to deceive, but they do not know that this claim is obviously unfounded in law and should be immediately rejected. He also requested that his elder brothers Cao Wensheng and Cao Wusheng be summoned to court to prove the monthly living expenses given to their father by the two. Peng Shi, judge of the First Special District Court, summoned the father and sons to a hearing and felt that it was contrary to ethics for family members to confront each other in court. He advised both parties to resolve the dispute peacefully and end the litigation as soon as possible. Because the plaintiff Cao Yuxiang and his wife Shen were unwilling to compromise, the peaceful negotiations did not make progress. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Judge Peng continued the hearing and summoned the plaintiff Qi Yuxiang's eldest son Wensheng, who had complied with the summons. According to his testimony, Shen and his father lived together and had children without being married. Cao was old and deaf, and Shen translated Wensheng's testimony to Cao, who angrily scolded Wensheng in a loud voice. Later, the defendant presented a newspaper, claiming that the report on the case in the newspaper was quite different from the previous hearing. The plaintiff deliberately sent the newspaper to the company where he worked, almost causing him to lose his job. He now wishes to increase the monthly alimony by five yuan, totaling fifteen yuan. The court then advised the defendant to pay twenty yuan per month and reach a settlement in court. However, the plaintiff Cao Yuxiang, after being informed by Shen, protested again, saying that this amount could not maintain the lives of the three of them. Shen also added that they had been living on debt for years and owed another two or three thousand yuan, which also needed to be repaid. Judge Peng verified the statements and felt that the claims of the two parties were far apart and the advice was not followed. Therefore, he ordered that the case be rescheduled for a continued hearing on January 16.</p>
<h3>Wang Yuying, a Worshiper of Money, After Obtaining 50,000 Gold from Her Husband, Sues for Her Daughter's Educational Expenses and Seeks Litigation Relief</h3>
<p>The family of Sun Zhizhai, the owner of Huizhong Hotel and a native of Wuxi, has been involved in lawsuits in recent years. This one subsided and another arose, with few peaceful days. Not long ago, Sun's concubine Wang Yuying filed a lawsuit against him over living expenses. After some mediation, Sun gave her 50,000 yuan and the concubine dropped the case. Since the settlement of that case, the concubine, in her capacity as the guardian of her daughter Fengyin, hired lawyer Li Mian and filed a lawsuit against Sun Zhizhai, Sun Bosheng, Sun Guangyuan, and others in the First Special District Court, seeking 70,000 yuan in legal tender for Fengyin's educational expenses, claiming that Fengyin is now thirteen years old and the defendants should be responsible for her future education and upbringing expenses. She requested a ruling to pay the sued amount and, because she has no financial resources to pay the litigation fees, begged for the favor of litigation relief and exemption from the litigation fees. The court, based on the pleading, held that it was necessary to conduct a detailed investigation of the plaintiff's request for litigation relief. Judge Peng Shi opened the hearing on the afternoon of yesterday and summoned Wang Yuying, mother of the plaintiff Sun Fengyin, to court for investigation. Judge Peng asked why, since the previous lawsuit resulted in her obtaining 50,000 yuan not long ago, and the huge sum should still exist, she was requesting litigation assistance. Since she is not truly without resources, her request is difficult to approve. The woman confessed that although she had received 50,000 yuan before, it was used to repay debts and there was nothing left. She was truly unable to pay the litigation fees, so she applied according to law. The court then examined the woman's clothing and ornaments and found that her clothes and shoes were gorgeous, with no sign of poverty. It was estimated that she had the ability to pay the litigation fee of 799 yuan and 5 jiao in legal tender. Her request for temporary exemption should not be granted. Therefore, she was ordered to comply and pay within a time limit of seven days and await the summons of the defendants to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Commander of French Troops in Shanghai, Pu Lati, Promoted to Colonel</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that, according to information obtained in Shanghai yesterday (30th), Lieutenant Colonel Pu Lati, commander of the French troops in Shanghai, has been promoted to the rank of colonel. Several other French officers stationed in Shanghai have also been promoted. Pu first came to Shanghai in April 1936 and was soon appointed commander of the French troops stationed in Shanghai. He will be relieved of his duties and return to his country at the end of March 1939. During the Shanghai war last year, Pu personally supervised the implementation of various military plans to protect the French Concession, which was praised by all parties.</p>
<h3>Hongkou Concentration Camp to Accommodate Jewish Refugees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports: Yesterday (the 30th), local news indicated that the Shanghai Committee for Assistance to European Jewish Refugees and its local affiliated associations are preparing to accommodate over 1,500 Jewish immigrants within the Hongkou concentration camp. The camp is planned to be established in the school building rented by the Public Works Department at 138 Ward Road and will be slightly modified. The conversion is expected to be completed in about a month. According to several responsible persons of the committee, the school can accommodate 2,000 refugees, but the number of refugees will not exceed 1,500 for the time being. This morning (the 31st), about 330 refugees arrived in Shanghai by ship. The committee was engaged in the final arrangements for receiving these refugees yesterday. However, the relief committee personnel are unaware of how many Jewish refugees will arrive in Shanghai in the coming weeks. It was stated yesterday that a German newspaper for the Jewish refugees already in Shanghai has been published, but few of them speak English, which greatly hinders their job seeking and self-establishment of shops. The Public Works Department has also considered the Jewish refugee problem and believes that the number of immigrants to Shanghai should be limited. It was learned yesterday that the Public Works Department has sent a letter to the consuls of the consular body regarding the limitation of the number of immigrants and will take restrictive actions soon.</p>
<p>The English-language North China Daily Mail reports: The "Bredenstein" arrived in Shanghai this morning (the 31st), carrying about 70 refugees from Central Europe, with considerable luggage and neatly dressed. The "Conte Rosso" also brought 250 refugees. The number of German Jews in Shanghai will reach 1,400 in the New Year. It is heard that many people have booked tickets to Shanghai. All tickets have been pre-booked by Jews leaving Germany and Austria months in advance. It is said that it is expected that about 5,000 Jews will pack up and come to Shanghai when the persecution of Jews in Europe ends.</p>
<h3>Youth Neglects Studies, Commits Suicide After Father's Reprimand - Self-Inflicted</h3>
<p>Li Xiong, a 19-year-old youth from Ningbo, residing at No. 9 Daode Lane, Belles Road, French Concession, spent his days wandering and neglecting his studies. At 8:30 yesterday morning, after being reprimanded by his father, he felt depressed and secretly swallowed a large amount of opium to commit suicide. After being discovered by his family, he was rushed to the hospital for treatment. It is said that the poisoning is quite deep and his life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Accusation for Failing to Support Concubine</h3>
<p>The late Shan Hongqing, former president of the Hangzhou General Chamber of Commerce, took a Shaoxing woman, Ms. Shen, as his concubine during his lifetime. After the fall of Hangzhou, Shan Zuoquan took his family to Shanghai for refuge and lived on Xujiahui Road in the French Concession. He neglected his father's concubine, Ms. Shan Shen, and did not provide for her living expenses. Ms. Shan Shen, through lawyers Xu Jianjie and Ling Xiancai, filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Shan Zuoquan of abandonment and requesting legal investigation. The court, based on the complaint, repeatedly summoned the defendant by Judge Miao Qingbang. The defendant never appeared, only his defense lawyer Chen Ying appeared to argue that the plaintiff was a former maid who falsely claimed to be the defendant's father's concubine. The court stated that the defendant must appear in court in person for the case to be clarified and instructed to postpone the date and summon the defendant for further interrogation. However, since the case was filed, it has been more than two months, and the court has repeatedly opened hearings, but the defendant has never appeared. The day before yesterday, another hearing was held, but the defendant still did not appear. According to his defense lawyer, the defendant is currently ill in Hangzhou and unable to come to Shanghai, presenting a prescription and letter as evidence. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that the defendant had repeatedly refused to appear and requested that the trial be suspended and the defendant be wanted to appear in court for further trial. The court, after reviewing the arguments, instructed both lawyers to report to the court after the defendant recovers and set another date for summons. If the defendant still does not appear after recovery, permission is granted to detain him for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Brothel Owner Buys Young Girl, Appeals Against Verdict</h3>
<p>Zang Wangshi, a 56-year-old old woman from Suzhou, used to be a brothel owner in the Eight Great Alleys in Beiping. She came to Shanghai in October last year to find and buy girls to become prostitutes. Zhao Yangshi, a 49-year-old Cantonese woman living at 207 Muir Road, due to poverty, sold her 15-year-old daughter, Miaozhen, for 310 yuan to a pleasure house. Because she was not fully developed and unable to receive guests, the girl was resold to Zang Wangshi, with Chen Afeng and Yuan Chunsheng as intermediaries, for a total of 630 yuan. On October 18, Zang Wangshi, along with her nephew's wife Zhang Aqiao and nephew's daughter Wang Shuzhen, took the girl Miaozhen on the Taikoo Company's Henan ship to Tianjin and then to Beiping. When the ship was setting sail, investigators Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongtang from the China Women and Children Relief Association boarded the ship and found them in the steerage cabin. They reported to the water patrol police, who dispatched detective Wang Songshan to arrest Zang Wangshi, Zhang Aqiao, and Wang Shuzhen. The girl was transferred to the French police station, and the two intermediary women Chen and Yuan were also arrested and sent to the Special No. 2 Court for investigation. After investigation, Zang Wangshi, Chen Afeng, and Yuan Chunsheng were prosecuted under Article 298 of the Criminal Law for obstructing freedom, while Zhang Aqiao and Wang Shuzhen were not prosecuted and were released. The initial trial sentenced Zang Wangshi to two years in prison, and Chen and Yuan to one year each. The girl was returned to her mother. Because Zang Wangshi disagreed with the verdict, she hired lawyers Wang Heng and Gu to appeal to the High Third Branch Court. The Criminal Division Chief Wu Tingqi, along with judges Gu and He, and a prosecutor, opened a collegial panel for trial the day before yesterday. According to Zang Wangshi's appeal, her daughter died last year and Miaozhen was adopted as her daughter through an introduction. She planned to take her to Beiping to learn to dance and rely on her in the future. Now she has been sentenced to two years in prison, and there is still an old mother at home, with no one to support and serve. She requested a reduction in sentence. After the court interrogated the appellant and the intermediary women Chen and Yuan, it was decided that there were problems with the case and the date was changed to summon the victim for further interrogation. The appellants were still remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>A Year of Enterprise</h3>
<p>— Song Xian</p>
<p>Since the full-scale war of resistance against Japan, China's publishing industry has suffered extremely serious blows. As far as the largest publishing companies are concerned, such as Commercial Press, China Book Company, World Book Company, and Kaiming Bookstore, the losses suffered due to the war are alarming. For example, Kaiming's general factory in Hongkou was completely destroyed by artillery fire; the World Book Company's general factory is still occupied. Although the losses of the Commercial Press and China Book Company's general companies are not so great, more than three-fifths of their branches in various places have become victims of the god of war due to the fall of many cities. The direct losses, such as goods and buildings, when added up, are certainly considerable; the indirect losses are even more significant. Everyone knows that book industry colleagues have always granted a lot of credit, and there would not be much discrepancy in normal times due to the connection between old and new debts. However, after this decisive war, all the selling bookstores were also destroyed, and there is almost no hope of recovering these debts. When these losses are added together, we may as well say that all the capital of these publishing companies has probably been completely eroded by this decisive war!</p>
<p>The general cultural circles have expressed much dissatisfaction with the silence of major publishers since the outbreak of the war, and even believe that they have failed to fully recognize the future of the war of resistance and lack courage and confidence in their work. However, if they can understand their alarming losses, they probably would not have such overly severe reproaches.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the direct center of the war of resistance, major publishers seem to be lacking in enthusiasm: however, in reality, the intensity of their work has not only not decreased compared to before the war, but is even greater than before the war. We know that the destruction of education since the war of resistance has been great, but the government has always strived to maintain it and prevent it from stopping. Schools in various war zones have moved to safer inland areas to continue classes. The textbooks used by the schools are still able to be supplied to this day, which must be said to be due to their efforts.</p>
<p>A week before August 13th, the Ministry of Education gathered major publishers in Shanghai for a meeting in Nanjing. At the meeting, they were notified that the war was about to break out and that they should quickly transport machinery and goods to the inland areas. However, the situation was already very tense at this time, and various means of transportation were in short supply, making it impossible to move in reality. After the outbreak of the war, the Ministry of Education sent personnel to Shanghai to persuade the publishing agencies to move to Wuhan with the factory relocation committee. At that time, Commercial Press, China Book Company, Kaiming Bookstore, and Life Bookstore all moved along. As a result, some arrived safely, some were bombed and sunk on the way, and some were robbed and their whereabouts are unknown. Statistically speaking, there were still more losses. When the war zone expanded and a large number of textbooks printed in various places were destroyed, they had no choice but to step up production in Shanghai and Hong Kong. On the one hand, the books that were produced could not be transported to the areas that needed them due to transportation difficulties, so they had to do their best in many ways. From these aspects, the difficulties of these publishers cannot but be given considerable sympathy.</p>
<p>In addition to the few major publishing companies, other publishers have also been making various efforts in various ways. For example, Life Bookstore and Shanghai Magazine Company have been working hard to publish small pamphlets and periodicals on the war of resistance in Sichuan, Han, and Guangdong. The newly emerging publishers after the war, such as Fuxing Press in Shanghai, Zhulin Bookstore, Fengyu Bookstore, and Dalu Bookstore in Hankou, have also done a lot of work. Most of the major books published in this year, such as "The Complete Works of Lu Xun," "Selected Works of Lenin," and "Capital," were completed by these publishers who did not have very strong capital, which cannot but be said to be an unprecedented harvest.</p>
<p>As far as periodicals are concerned, since the outbreak of the war, most of the magazines of major publishers have been suspended, and this point has also been criticized by various parties. This seems to be a strange phenomenon compared to the new periodicals that have sprung up everywhere. If the publication of periodicals is a profitable business, why are the companies that have stopped publication willing to sit back and watch the loss of profits? If it is a losing business, why are there so many new periodicals? According to what we know, the basic subscribers of these suspended magazines often number two or three thousand for the more popular ones, and generally no less than four or five thousand for the less popular ones. From a business standpoint, they are of course much more profitable than new publications without a foundation. However, the reason why they cannot but stop publication lies in this point. For the sake of the large number of subscribers and the broad business area, the circulation of their publications cannot be limited to one place. On the one hand, due to the lack of printing facilities in the inland areas, they cannot be printed in various places; on the other hand, due to the obstruction of transportation and the difficulty of mail delivery, magazines published in area A cannot easily reach readers in area B and are inevitably subject to criticism from readers. This is really the main reason for their suspension of publication.</p>
<p>These many words seem to be defending the few major publishing companies. We acknowledge that their current state of silence should be criticized. However, their losses suffered in the war and their efforts for the country and the nation seem to need to be understood by the general public.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will say, according to this situation, will China's publishing industry not be completely destroyed? This is not the case. According to our observation, it will not only not be destroyed, but will instead gain a new path for rebirth. In the past, the business vision of various publishers was mostly focused on areas with relatively developed culture such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Fujian, and Guangdong, while neglecting the remote inland areas. This state of abnormal development is really unreasonable. Due to this decisive war, the cultural center has moved inland, and the publishing industry has also followed suit and developed in remote areas that have never been paid attention to before. Therefore, after the end of the war, the business development of the publishing industry will definitely increase several times compared to before, and the culture in various places will develop from abnormal to reasonable, which is really very optimistic.</p>
<p>Wu Mu's Inscription</p>
<p>The spirit of vowing to die for the country and resist the enemy leaps out of the paper. It is not only the strength of the brushstroke that is admirable. If there were no traitors at that time, the Jin people would certainly not have achieved their goals in the Central Plains. (Bai Yue)</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Libraries</h3>
<p>— Bosheng</p>
<p>Our countrymen have always been fond of collecting books, but they are usually accumulated by individuals and not made available to the public. The library system originated in Western Europe, and due to Shanghai's status as a treaty port, the library system arrived with Europeans. When Jesuit missionaries settled in Xujiawan in the twenty-seventh year of the Daoguang reign (1847), they began collecting books for reference, and ninety years later, it has become the famous Xuhui Library. The library houses over 1,610 local chronicles from various provinces of our country; well-known newspapers such as Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, and The Eastern Miscellany are also preserved in their entirety; and there are 80,000 Western books. In the twenty-ninth year of the Daoguang reign (1849), Westerners in the British Concession organized a book club, which expanded into the "Shanghai Library" by the first year of the Xianfeng reign (1851). In the first year of the Republic of China (1912), the honorary secretary of the library, Sausmares, and the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Gray, after some discussions, decided to donate all the books of the Shanghai Library to the Municipal Council, which became the present-day Shanghai Municipal Council Public Library. The library was initially commonly known as the Foreign Language Academy. On February 8th of the third year of the Guangxu reign (1877), Shen Bao reported on the library, saying: "Westerners in this port have established a Foreign Language Academy, which contains ten thousand volumes of books. Every year, five or six hundred new books are added. Readers only need to pay ten taels of silver annually to borrow and read them at any time, and return them after reading. This is truly an excellent method."</p>
<p>It not only introduced the library but also greatly encouraged the library system. Today, the library's collection, both Chinese and Western, totals more than 23,000 volumes; the number of visitors and books borrowed over the years can be found in the Municipal Council's reports.</p>
<p>In the tenth year of the Tongzhi reign (1871), the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society completed its meeting hall, and a part of it was designated as a library, specializing in Eastern books. By the twentieth year of the Republic of China (1931), it had 15,000 Western books and 1,000 Chinese books.</p>
<p>It is described as the earliest library in Shanghai and still exists today. As for the enthusiasm of our countrymen for the library cause, it began after the founding of the Republic of China. In the fourth year of the Republic of China (1915), the Ministry of Education promulgated eleven articles of the Regulations for Popular Libraries, which attracted much attention. In the same year, schools established the Nanyang Middle School Library and the Soochow University Law School Library, while commercial institutions established the Chung Hwa Book Company Library. In the seventh year of the Republic of China (1918), the Jiaotong University Library and the Songpo Library were established. In the eighth year (1919), the Young Men's Christian Association Library was established. In the ninth year (1920), the YMCA Library was established. The library cause was gradually developing.</p>
<p>The thirteenth year of the Republic of China (1924) was the year the Shanghai Library Association was organized. In the years surrounding the association's organization, the library cause seemed like a rising sun in the east, showing a vigorous image. Here are a few examples as evidence: (1) The rise of public libraries. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China (1922), the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce established a commercial library, open to the public. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China (1926), the Oriental Library of the Commercial Press was opened. (2) The establishment of institutional libraries. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China (1929), the First District Party Department Library was established, and in the twentieth year of the Republic of China (1931), the Customs Library was established. (3) The popularity of school libraries. In the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921), the Datong University Library was established; in the eleventh year (1922), the Fudan University Library; in the twelfth year (1923), the Qingxin and Minli Middle School Libraries; in the thirteenth year (1924), the Chih Chih University Library; in the fifteenth year (1926), the Guanghua and Daxia University Libraries; in the sixteenth year (1927), the Jinan University Library; and in the seventeenth year (1928), the Aurora University Library were established. The above are only the libraries of famous schools. Since the library cause was popular, many primary and secondary schools also established libraries, but upon examination, some were merely reading rooms.</p>
<p>During the development of the library cause, a very unfortunate event occurred: the January 28th Incident in the twenty-first year of the Republic of China (1932), when the Oriental Library was completely reduced to ashes. The predecessor of the Oriental Library was Hanfenlou. Hanfenlou was established by the Commercial Press for the reference of its editors. It began in the thirtieth year of the Guangxu reign (1904) when the Commercial Press was established. Zhang Yuanji was in charge, and after twenty years of Zhang's collection, the library reached hundreds of thousands of volumes. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China (1924), the Commercial Press built a large building opposite its factory, named it the Oriental Library, and opened its collection of 340,000 books to the public, making it the first library in Shanghai. Even in terms of local chronicles, it had 2,641 types from as many as 22 provinces, ranking third in the number of local chronicles among all libraries in China. Who knew that when the Japanese invaders attacked, countless precious books in the library would be burned? The library reopened on August 1st of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China (1932), and on April 5th of the twenty-second year (1933), the library's board of directors decided to prepare for the restoration of the Oriental Library.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the Lugouqiao Incident suddenly occurred, and the Sino-Japanese War has not yet ended. The Oriental Library has not been able to recover soon.</p>
<p>Although the Ministry of Education had promulgated regulations in the fourth year of the Republic of China (1915) requiring all provinces, counties, and districts to establish popular libraries, the Shanghai Municipal Library was not established until the nineteenth year of the Republic of China (1930), nominally as the Municipal Circulating Library, on a very small scale. The following spring, the municipal government allocated 25,000 yuan and ordered the Municipal Bureau of Education to establish the Municipal Library in the Confucius Temple. In December of that year, the library building was completed, and it opened in January of the twenty-second year (1933). In the autumn of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China (1933), Mayor Wu Tiecheng initiated the construction of a large municipal library in the city center and established a preparatory committee to actively pursue it. By mid-July of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China (1935), the library building was completed. It was located in the administrative district of the city center, between Youlu Road in front of the government and Youlu Road in the south of the government, south of Xilu Road to the west of the government, facing east. The layout was in the shape of the Chinese character "工", with horizontal extensions at both ends of the front part, protruding forward and backward to form wing rooms. The maximum distance between the north and south ends was 66 meters, with a building area of 1,620 square meters, a total floor area of 3,470 square meters, and a volume of 16,000 cubic meters. The exterior of the library building adopted a hybrid style of modern and Chinese architecture. The interior layout was very elaborate. The stacks were all equipped with new steel bookshelves. The total length of the book arrangement was 15,000 meters, which could accommodate 400,000 volumes. On May 1st of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China (1936), the library was officially established. On June 1st, Mayor Wu invited book collectors, educators, journalists, and people from all walks of life who had assisted the library during the preparatory period to visit the library and hold a tea party. The children's reading room opened on June 8th, and the entire library opened on September 1st. This library could have been the largest and most promising municipal library in Shanghai, but who knew that the August 13th Incident would suddenly occur, and it would fall into the hands of the enemy and become a den of foxes and ghosts.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese warlords launched their war of aggression against China, Shanghai's cultural undertakings have plummeted. Universities either moved inland or to the concessions, confined to residential buildings with no library facilities. Students often suffered from a lack of books for reference. Ding Fubao of Wuxi specially opened his collection of books at the Medical Book Bureau on Baker Road, greatly benefiting scholars. However, Ding's books were mostly works on Sinology, and modern science and Western books and newspapers were not well-stocked. The Hongying Library had been working on clippings for a long time, but it was still in the preparatory stage and had not been opened to the public. Currently, the following are available for scholars to consult and use:</p>
<p>Customs Library</p>
<p>Municipal Council Public Library</p>
<p>Aurora Library</p>
<p>Xujiahui Library</p>
<p>Royal Asiatic Society Library</p>
<p>French Association Library</p>
<p>China International Library</p>
<p>Young Men's Christian Association Library</p>
<p>YMCA Library</p>
<p>United Library of Christian Universities</p>
<p>Mingfu Library</p>
<p>Ding's Library</p>
<p>China Circulation Library</p>
<p>Dingxiang Library</p>
<p>For the above libraries, an introduction is required to enter the Xuhui Library. The Customs Library has many books on economics and commerce in English. The Mingfu Library, located in the China Science Society, has more than 200 kinds of scientific journals, totaling more than 30,000 volumes, which are the most precious. Those who study science can go to this library. The China International Library was reorganized from the original library of the World Society and is still located at the original site of the World Society on Furguson Road. Its collection focuses on international relations. The Aurora Library has many French books, while the Young Men's Christian Association Library and the YMCA Library have many Christian books. Readers can make use of the various libraries according to their nature as described in this article.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Museums</h3>
<p>— Zhiyuan</p>
<p>The events and objects recorded in books are numerous, but without physical objects to prove them, the traces of human activity become mere words on paper. Therefore, the museum system exists to supplement the deficiencies of books. The establishment of museums in Shanghai should be attributed to Father Heude, a French Catholic priest, who founded the Xujiahui Museum at the end of the sixth year of the Tongzhi reign (1867). It was decided by the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society to establish the Shanghai Museum in the thirteenth year of the Tongzhi reign (1874). The Shanghai Municipal Government, recognizing the importance of museums, moved in the autumn of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China (1933) to build a museum in the city center, which officially opened in the twenty-sixth year (1937), giving Shanghai its first municipal museum established by Chinese. The following is a description of the three major museums in Shanghai and their development.</p>
<p>(1) Heude Museum (Aurora Museum)</p>
<p>Father Heude was a biologist who arrived in Shanghai in December of the sixth year of the Tongzhi reign (1867). Seeing that the Xujiahui Cathedral had a small collection of biological specimens, he decided to expand it and establish a museum. Father Heude soon went to the interior of China to investigate, paying close attention to the Yangtze River basin. Each time he returned to Shanghai, he brought back a large number of strange specimens. To collect Père David's Deer, he went to various parts of the Northwest, and his achievements were enormous. His book "The Père David's Deer" has become one of the world's famous works on biology. In the ninth year of the Guangxu reign (1883), he began to build a museum south of the Xujiahui Jesuit General Hospital to store specimens. It was open to the public every afternoon without charge. At that time, the lower floor stored mammals and fish and bird skeletons, and the upper floor stored beetles, shells, mammal taxidermy, birds, and reptiles. Father Heude presided over this museum for thirty years. Afterwards, it was headed by Father Conrtois, then Father Savio, and now by Father Piel, although Father Savio is still in the museum as a researcher.</p>
<p>As time went by, more and more specimens were collected, and the old building was no longer sufficient. Therefore, in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China (1930), construction of a large-scale museum building began on the site of Aurora University. The museum has three floors, each 80 meters long, divided into three exhibition rooms, as well as research rooms, laboratories, libraries, photography rooms, etc. To the south of the museum, a botanical garden was opened to cultivate flowers and trees for research. It opened in the winter of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China (1933), with visiting hours set at 2:00 to 5:00 pm on Sundays, Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, with a ticket price of two jiao. Currently, the first and second exhibition rooms are open to the public. The first exhibition room displays Chinese antiques. These antiques were collected by Brother Ge of the Tushanwan Orphanage. The antiques are divided into metal, jade, pottery, and embroidery. At the northern end of the room is a display of the remains of Xie Jiazhen of Chongming, which is most eye-catching. Xie Jiazhen was a Juren (successful candidate in the imperial examination) during the Shunzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty and died in the Kangxi reign. In the sixth year of the Republic of China (1917), his descendants dug up his tomb. The body was not decayed, and the clothes and bedding were as new, as was his wife, Madam Lin. The coffin was obtained by Brother Ge, who made a wooden statue of Xie Jiazhen, dressed it in the original burial clothes, and placed the objects from the coffin beside it. The embroidery on display is a type of Gu Embroidery, a famous product of Shanghai, known as Kong Embroidery. The second exhibition room contains biology specimens, such as mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and mollusks. Bird specimens are beautifully arranged and lifelike, and insect specimens are also very elaborate, as the museum is currently focusing on entomology. Plant specimens have a dedicated room, with a total of 50,000 specimens. In addition, the various books published by the museum are very comprehensive and highly admired by specialized scholars around the world.</p>
<p>(2) Shanghai Museum</p>
<p>The Shanghai Museum is located on the fourth and fifth floors of the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society at No. 20 Museum Road in the Public Concession. The museum was founded in the thirteenth year of the Tongzhi reign (1874) and has been around for more than sixty years. The honorary curators have mostly been naturalists and biologists, and the current honorary curator, Sowerby, is a giant in the field. Therefore, the museum's exhibits are mostly biological specimens, although there are also many works of art and antiques. The sources and regions of the items are mostly from China, as the museum is aimed at studying China. The first honorary curator of the museum was W. B. Pryre. Shen Bao reported on the museum on October 7th of the first year of the Guangxu reign (1875):</p>
<p>"In major cities of the West, it is customary for the people of the area to build a museum to display birds, beasts, and various animals for naturalists to enjoy at any time. In a prefecture city, the museum will be filled with the products of the entire prefecture; in the capital city, the museum will be filled with the products of the entire country, and it is called a museum. Now, Western merchants living in Shanghai are imitating the Western model and establishing a museum in this port, gathering various objects from China and the East. Although the enterprise is just beginning, the items on display are already numerous. Among the furry creatures, there are wild boars from the side of Lake Tai; among the birds, there are hawks, magpies, sparrows, etc.; there are also aquatic creatures, which cannot be fully described. Other insects such as mantises, grasshoppers, and butterflies are also classified and labeled. Each item is labeled with where it came from and who donated it. Visitors, both Chinese and foreign, are not charged. Western countries have wonderful methods for preserving feathers of all kinds, so that even when the skin is dry, the feathers will not fall out. Now, the Chinese have obtained this method; and they have also purchased glass eyes from abroad, so that no matter what strange beast or rare bird it is, once decorated, it will be lifelike and full of vitality. All the items in the museum are provided by Western naturalists. The person in charge of this is Mr. Pryre of Yuanfang Trading Company."</p>
<p>Museum Road was originally named Yuanmingyuan Road. The municipal authorities of the concession changed the name out of respect for the museum. Since the third year of the Guangxu reign (1877), the Municipal Council has been donating funds to support the museum annually.</p>
<p>(3) Shanghai Municipal Museum</p>
<p>The proposal for the Shanghai Municipal Museum was made in the autumn of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China (1933). The funds came from municipal public bonds, with the construction cost of the museum set at 300,000 yuan. The architectural appearance was similar to that of the Municipal Library, located opposite the library. The two museums faced each other from afar, forming the left and right wings of the municipal government. In the spring of the twenty-fourth year (1935), the preparatory committee of the museum appointed a temporary board of directors to manage it. The chairman of the board was Mr. Ye Gongchuo. Mr. Ye was a lover of art and was good at managing</p>
<p>(Continued on page 15)</p>
<h2>Page 15</h2>
<p>affairs, so he was able to manage the museum with ease. The board of directors decided that the nature of the museum would be primarily art and history, with history focusing on Shanghai.</p>
<p>The construction of the museum building was completed on the Double Tenth Festival of the twenty-fourth year (1935). The internal layout was roughly as follows: (1) Ground floor: The central entrance is the lobby, about 17.5 meters wide and 14 meters long, with stairs to the upper floors and rooms for coats, hats, and souvenirs. From here, one enters the main hall, 11.5 meters wide and 18 meters long. The hall displays the four large stone carvings of the local worthy Lu Shen, and the walls are hung with twelve Gu Embroidery tapestries, a specialty of Shanghai. There are also two clocks that indicate the time in Shanghai and the corresponding time in various countries around the world. Inside the main hall is the first exhibition room. The two sides of the hall are corridors. Both corridors display various documents from Shanghai. The corridors connect to the offices in the left and right wings of the front part. The protruding part of the left wing is the library; the protruding part of the right wing is the lecture hall. (2) Second floor: The central part is divided into two sections. The front section is the art section, with a large puppet show stage. The rear section is the history section, displaying clothing, utensils, music, embroidery, and models of hairstyles from various dynasties, which are particularly eye-catching. The two corridors also display historical exhibits. The two wings have the best lighting and display paintings, calligraphy, porcelain, bronzes, and pottery, which are the focus of the art section. (3) Above the front exhibition hall on the central second floor is a mezzanine, with the ground level with the flat roof of the rear half. From here, one can reach the gatehouse on the fourth floor via an open-air staircase. The gatehouse also has a platform around it for distant views. There is a basement under the main hall for boilers and other equipment. In April of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China (1936), the museum opened with an exhibition of Chinese architecture, and visitors were crowded and full of praise. In January of the twenty-sixth year (1937), the museum officially opened to the public, and thousands of Chinese and foreign visitors came to visit every day, with traffic in the city center constantly congested. July 7th was Shanghai City Memorial Race Day, and the municipal government's affiliated agencies jointly held various exhibitions to celebrate. The museum held the Shanghai Literature Exhibition, with extremely fine and systematic exhibits, which were praised by all sectors. Unexpectedly, it</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Music Scene in the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Zhongyue</p>
<p>Following the sound of cannons on "August 13th," many Shanghai artists left Shanghai. Due to the environment, Shanghai's musical activities in 1938 were quite lonely in all respects.</p>
<p>Let us take a bird's-eye view of the Chinese schools, movies, halls, and publishing industries.</p>
<p>In the academy, the National Conservatory of Music was shut down due to environmental reasons and was replaced by a private conservatory. The faculty remained the same, but the best professor, Mr. Huang Zi, unfortunately passed away, and many excellent young people went to serve on the front lines. The conservatory then re-enrolled a large number of new students; the new students' musical level was naturally lower, and the conservatory's professors had to work doubly hard. Under the leadership of Mr. Xiao Youmei, the entire faculty and students were able to cooperate and try their best to ensure that the vacant rear could quickly obtain new recruits for the musical scene.</p>
<p>Smaller music schools included Chen Youxin's Shandeshanghai Conservatory of Music, and Zhang Yanbao, Li Dong, Huang Yijun, and Huang Tinggui's Guangming Conservatory of Music, both of which held concerts. Private music educators included Xia Guoqiong (piano), Chen Zhong and Pan Boyan (violin), Chen Gexin and Si Yigui (vocal music), Ye Huaide (flute), Zhang Zhenfu (cello), and Zhang Hao, Qiu Menghen, and Qu Lizhong (various fields).</p>
<p>Many people wrote insert songs for movies, but most were "amateur" composers. Yan Gongshang consistently used his Kunqu opera style; "The Mermaid Princess" was relatively easy to sing. Wu Cun wrote a song called "The Four Seasons Bloom," which was very popular in dance halls and had a folk song flavor. Although the music that Chen Minggao wrote for "Woman" had some quirks, it was ultimately a more pure work, although the performers were not always up to par. Chen Gexin's "Scandal" and "Spring Breeze and Wild Grass" were two excellent love songs, but of course, they would lose their meaning due to the times when they were removed from the play. After breaking away from his old life, Li Jinhui went to Chongqing to devote himself to his new life, while Shanghai retained his younger brother Li Jingguang to continue his older brother's old path in film music composition.</p>
<p>Very few concerts were held. We can remember the combined concerts of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music and the Guangming Conservatory of Music, and Tan Xiaolin's memorial concert for Mr. Huang Zi. The Experimental Orchestra played many works by Chinese composers, and only Tan Xiaolin's Fantasy can be remembered for its technical achievement. The Guangming, Zhonghua, Lianhe, and Shanghai Harmonica Societies all held concerts, with programs that were mostly so-called "popular songs" or "pure art" pieces. Except for the Zhonghua and Shanghai societies, which played Chen Gexin's "Spring" (also known as "Survive This Cold Winter"), and the Zhonghua society, which played more marches, the others had too few marches. However, since the proceeds from the performances went to refugee relief, we can say that they fulfilled a part of their responsibility.</p>
<p>The 250-person chorus "The Holy City" under the direction of Zhao Meibo is also worth mentioning. Although there were unsatisfactory aspects, Zhao and his many sacred music colleagues' attempt to plead for refugees should not be erased.</p>
<p>There were also few publications. Anti-Japanese war songs were only reprinted, while publications such as electric music songs were available. Xu Chi published three issues of "Pure Literature," which included Chen Gexin's "Worries" and "Water Wheel." "Self-Study" had many relatively progressive songs. The Conservatory of Music published three issues of "Music Monthly," which included songs composed by Professor Li Weining and some musical essays. Music World also introduced some art and poetry, and only "Lullaby in the Wind and Rain" had a sense of the times.</p>
<p>Although, due to the gradual clarity of the artists' understanding, various performers, composers, and organizations are uniting, and there is more active work to be done. Various singing groups and harmonica societies will, under the same mission as the artists, set aside their opinions and cooperate. Publishers will release a large number of new poems and songs that are relevant to the times. The music weekly that was once rumored in the Huamei Morning Post will also be published. Many experts have agreed to abandon their academic works and write for the masses in this great era. Musicians are striving for their position and due work in drama, film, and schools. Let us wish in advance the "opening of spring flowers" for the art of this "isolated island"!</p>
<p>St. John's University</p>
<h3>Brief History of the Department of Journalism</h3>
<p>— Tao Qixiang</p>
<p>The first to establish vocational education in journalism nationwide was St. John's University in Shanghai. In 1921 (Year 10 of the Republic of China), the President of the university, Dr. F. L. Hawks Pott, invited Mr. Don Patterson, the business manager of the Shanghai Weekly Review (later known as the China Weekly Review of Millard's Review), to serve as a journalism lecturer at the university, teaching journalism interviewing and writing. This marked the earliest journalism course in China. For practical experience, the university founded a small English weekly newspaper covering news related to St. John's, named The St. John's Dial, also known as</p>
<p>In the following year (Year 11 of the Republic of China), Mr. Maurlee E. Yotaw came to China from the United States and joined St. John's University as a formal journalism teacher. Both Don Patterson and Maurlee E. Yotaw were graduates of the School of Journalism at the University of Missouri in the United States, which was the first of its kind in the world.</p>
<p>From a very humble beginning to the present day, the interest of Chinese youth in journalism has steadily increased over these eighteen years. Many St. John's graduates who studied journalism are now serving in newspapers and news agencies throughout the country, and their achievements are highly praised by all sectors of society. For example, the New Year special issue of the Shen Bao will include articles collected and written by current journalism students at the school. These students will be the pioneers of the Chinese journalism field in the future.</p>
<p>The journalism department at St. John's University is currently the only one in East China. Although other universities, such as Shanghai University and Fudan University, have also established journalism departments, they were unable to maintain continuous operations. Currently, Shanghai University only has a few journalism courses within its business school. Since the establishment of the Associated Christian Colleges of East China last year, in addition to the junior and senior students of St. John's being able to select journalism courses, students from Shanghai University, Soochow University, and Hangzhou University can also enroll.</p>
<p>The St. John's University journalism department offers several specialized courses each year, with Mr. Maurlee E. Yotaw in charge of the entire department. The courses include "Journalism Interviewing and Writing," "News Editing," "Brief History of World Journalism," "Advertising," "Advertising Design," and "Salesmanship," among others. The number of students in each class ranges from a dozen to several dozen. The St. John's Dial serves as a practical tool for the department's students.</p>
<p>Although the current campus of The St. John's Dial is located in the Cishu Building, and the students are all commuting students, resulting in a significant reduction in news about the school, the publication continues. The content still consists of articles of interest to students, faculty, and alumni of the school. The current editor of the weekly newspaper is Mr. Tao Qixiang. The weekly newspaper is financially independent, with expenses covered by student publication fees and hundreds of copies ordered each issue by the St. John's University Alumni Association. Therefore, although the newspaper does not have advertising revenue, it can still balance its income and expenses. It is published every Wednesday.</p>
<p>The authorities at St. John's University hope to establish a journalism college in the near future, specifically training young people aspiring to serve in the newspaper industry, teaching them the best European, American, and Chinese knowledge and skills related to journalism, to expand the scope of this long-standing department's work, and to cultivate outstanding talent for the Chinese news and publishing industry, Chinese and English newspapers, news agencies, etc. Raising the standards of the Chinese journalism industry is also the college's goal, in the hope that in the future, people in the Chinese journalism industry can compete internationally with leaders from all fields, jointly seeking China's international status and national revival. The suggestion to establish a journalism college, in addition to the strong cooperation of the authorities of East China universities, would greatly benefit if it could receive the support and promotion of advanced figures in the Chinese and Western press in Shanghai. Its success can be predicted, and its effectiveness can be maximized. Shanghai is the axis of China's news and publishing industry, and from the perspective of journalism, it will continue to be one of the most important places for Chinese cultural undertakings. Therefore, if a journalism college can obtain the assistance of the press, its future will be limitless.</p>
<p>The Department of Journalism at Yenching University in Beiping is the largest in the country and has long enjoyed a reputation at home and abroad. Its initial establishment was also on a small scale, but it later relied on the support of the press in North China and other regions, enthusiastically seeking reforms in its affairs. The fundraising by a committee composed entirely of people from the press, has led to excellent results today. If the suggestion for a journalism college at St. John's can be assisted by advanced figures in the Shanghai press, then its establishment should not be a problem.</p>
<h3>General Situation of the Shanghai Publishing Industry</h3>
<p>— Hua Kun</p>
<p>Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>I. Past History</p>
<p>1.  The Process of Establishment</p>
<p>The founder of Kaiming Bookstore was Mr. Zhang Xichen. Since 1926, he had been publishing the New Woman magazine from his home in Baoshan Lane, Baoshan Road, and subsequently published many new books. In order to eliminate the bad habits of the publishing industry at the time, he strictly selected the content of publications, paid attention to the beauty of the format, and strived for low prices. Therefore, he gained the trust of many readers. When the publishing organization in the home was no longer able to meet the needs of society, Mr. Zhang joined forces with Mr. Xia Gaizun, Mr. Feng Zikai, and other famous figures in the cultural world to form a bookstore.</p>
<p>2.  Expansion of Business and Publishing Trends</p>
<p>Since its establishment, Kaiming has strived to improve the publishing business and has gained the trust of a large readership. By 1930, the privately organized bookstore was no longer able to meet the needs of society, so it began to expand and was reorganized into a limited liability company. Branch stores were also established in various places, including Nanjing, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Hankou, Wuchang, Changsha, Beiping, and Shenyang. The main factory also underwent several relocations due to the expansion of business, and later settled in Wuzhou Road. The capital was gradually increased from several hundred yuan to 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In terms of publishing trends, the initial target audience was middle school students, and the "Middle School Student" magazine best represents this trend.</p>
<p>Later, their business expanded, and the target audience for publishing also expanded from middle school students to elementary school students. The newly compiled elementary school textbooks had an original spirit, and the "New Youth" magazine, which was published next, was an intermediate reading material between elementary school and middle school. At the same time, the scope of publishing was expanded to all aspects, and specialized works of the same nature as the university series were also published one after another. Valuable ancient books were also printed one after another. For example, the reduced-size printing of the "Twenty-Five Histories," the compilation of the "Supplements to the Twenty-Five Histories," and the collection of "Famous Ci Poets of the Qing Dynasty" were praised by the academic community. At that time, due to the complexity of personnel affairs and the urgency of world changes, newspapers and magazines presented a phenomenon of clouds steaming and rosy clouds. Therefore, people in society felt the regret of not being able to browse them all. Therefore, they published the "Monthly Magazine." In addition to establishing various categories to accommodate important materials from all aspects, there were also special articles to analyze and discuss various important issues. In this way, their publishing trends expanded even further.</p>
<p>3.  Statistics of Publications</p>
<p>How many books have they actually published? Let us make a statistic to see. The following table is a classification statistic from the beginning of business in August 1926 to December 31, 1938:</p>
<p>Category Volumes</p>
<p>General 16 6</p>
<p>Philosophy 42 46</p>
<p>Religion 7 7</p>
<p>Social Sciences 172 27</p>
<p>Linguistics 76 147</p>
<p>Natural Sciences 90 102</p>
<p>Applied Technology 20 20</p>
<p>Arts 91 112</p>
<p>Literature 300 393</p>
<p>History and Geography 103 133</p>
<p>Total 917 1242</p>
<p>(Note) Various magazines and loose-leaf selections are not included</p>
<p>II. Present and Future</p>
<p>In the summer of 1931, the National Government was determined to resist the war. The Shanghai book industry received instructions from the Ministry of Education to rush to produce enough primary and secondary school textbooks for one or two years of use in the shortest possible time and to transport them to the interior for storage immediately. Naturally, Kaiming Bookstore was no exception. They were also working on this in the factory in Hongkou. However, at that time, the sentiment of resisting the war was rising day by day, and the people of Hongkou were evacuating from the Hongkou district like a tide. However, Kaiming Bookstore was too busy with work to take care of the issue of relocation.</p>
<p>On the morning of August 13, the sacred all-out war of resistance began. The employees of Kaiming Bookstore, who were still working in the Hongkou factory, did not leave their workplaces to escape until they heard the sound of artillery fire. A week later, the many finished and unfinished goods, as well as machines and original manuscripts, were all destroyed by artillery fire. Later, as the war deepened, all the places where Kaiming had branches became war zones one after another. Therefore, the branches in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Hankou, Wuchang, and Changsha had to retreat. (Shenyang and Beiping had retreated as early as six and one years ago, respectively.) Some places did not have time to retreat and were burned down. Judging from their tangible losses alone, the numbers are already very small!</p>
<p>Kaiming has more than ten years of history and a considerable position in the publishing industry. If it is destroyed once, it will not be able to stand on its own. It will not only show its fragility, but also will not be able to face the country. Although they do not have big capitalists as backers, they are still struggling to overcome this difficult situation. They are still publishing new books and reprinting previously published books, and have established new branches in Chongqing, Guilin, Kunming, Guiyang, and Wanxian. A bright future must be ahead of them, and this is believable.</p>
<h3>The World Book Company</h3>
<p>Undoubtedly, World Book Company, Commercial Press, and China Book Company are the three largest publishers in China, in terms of history, scale, and contribution to culture. After the start of the August 13th Incident, Commercial Press and China Book Company successively moved to Hong Kong, while only World Book Company remained in Shanghai.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The World Book Company's distribution center on Fuzhou Road had previously suffered a bombing tragedy. Subsequently, the main factory in Hongkou repeatedly experienced the removal of large quantities of stored books by the Japanese. The situation was reported in various Chinese and foreign newspapers, which further aroused the central government and all sectors of society's enthusiastic sympathy and concern for the World Book Company. Because this newspaper is publishing a cultural edition for the New Year supplement, we specifically visited the authorities of the World Book Company, and they answered as follows:</p>
<p>Why was there no plan to relocate the factory beforehand?</p>
<p>According to his answer, the World Book Company and other peers, such as Commercial Press and China Book Company, had submitted a plan to the central government in the spring of 1936 to relocate the factory, hoping that the central government could provide appropriate convenience. At that time, the World Book Company planned to move to Wuchang, the Commercial Press planned to move to Changsha, and the China Book Company planned to move to Nanchang. The purpose was to disperse each company in various places, so that if international warfare occurred, the publishing industry could avoid major threats. However, later, due to various problems between the central government and local governments, it was quite difficult, so there was no rapid progress. In the summer of 1937, the central government intended to have the three major companies relocate, but soon the Lugouqiao Incident occurred. It was too late and there was no time to relocate. Later, Commercial Press and China Book Company expanded their existing factories in Hong Kong, while the World Book Company believed that if there was a solution in Hong Kong, there must also be a solution in Shanghai. In other words, if there was no solution in Shanghai, there would be no solution in Hong Kong either. Therefore, it was decided not to set up another factory in Hong Kong. This point, according to their experience of more than a year, has proven that their judgment at that time was very insightful. Now they are publishing in Shanghai, which is no different from Commercial Press and China Book Company publishing in Hong Kong. Moreover, the expenses in Shanghai are said to be more economical than those in Hong Kong; the cost is lower, and the price of books can be cheaper.</p>
<p>How are you publishing now?</p>
<p>He said that after the start of the August 13th Incident, they looked for a suitable publishing place in the concession area. The current production capacity is no less than before the war. As long as there is a need, they can still supply in large quantities. They recently counted that a total of 189 kinds of new books have been published since the war, an average of one new book every three days. However, this is still the result of special restrictions due to the expansion of the war zone and business relations. All kinds of reprinted books, whether textbooks or reference books, are prepared as usual and supplied continuously. They also try their best to transport books to various provinces in the interior. Now, transportation is the most problematic, the cost is often ten times higher than before, and the time is indefinitely long, not including losses on the road. This is not just their situation, but listening to his words, it is really extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Why are there so many stored books in the main factory?</p>
<p>He said that because they did not have time to relocate the factory, they planned to store enough books for several years of use in various provinces in the interior. Unexpectedly, the incident happened suddenly, and they did not have time to transport them all out. Reports have stated that more than 6 million volumes have been transported away by the Japanese. In fact, it is more than this number. According to the actual storage of books in the main factory, there were more than 30 million volumes. It is heard that more than 10 million volumes have been successively burned by the Japanese. The open space in front of the factory is covered with ashes that are more than a foot thick. It is truly an unprecedented disaster for the Chinese cultural world. What new publishing plans do you have?</p>
<p>He said happily that in order to meet the needs of readers and seek their own revival, there are many new publishing plans. What can be reported here is that from this year, within the possible range, they will still often restore the large-scale publication of new books before the war. In the near future, there will be more new books that can be published; at the same time, they welcome submissions from all walks of life, or suggestions for editorial plans. They want to seek growth from the ashes.</p>
<p>Opinions on the publishing industry</p>
<p>He said that the publishing business is very difficult, especially in this period. The first point is in terms of management. Chinese publishers, due to various reasons, all adopt a three-in-one system of editorial office, printing office, and distribution office; therefore, management is very complex. For example, editors and authors are all literati, printers and binders are all warriors, and there is a group of businessmen who are neither literati nor warriors in between; therefore, it is really not easy for the general manager to deal with such a situation. To tell a joke, you really need to be "proficient in both literature and martial arts," otherwise, it is inevitable that you will lose sight of one thing while attending to another. The second point is in terms of capital. The publishing business requires extremely large capital, such as factory equipment, raw materials, semi-finished products, total office stock, goods in transit, branch office stock, accounts receivable, etc., which require six or seven batches of capital. In order to have a business location and spread throughout the country, the above items all require a very large quantity to cope with, and books are not like daily necessities such as cotton yarn and cloth, which can be mortgaged or sold at any time and place; therefore, the above items all require sufficient capital to be turned around. The third point is. Because of the underdevelopment of Chinese education, the people's annual consumption on books is very small; therefore, the publishing industry in China can be said to be still in its infancy.</p>
<p>Although he said all the current difficulties of the publishing industry, he still constantly expressed great optimism for the future of the publishing industry. Although the World Book Company has encountered an unprecedented disaster, it is already actively planning for revival. Such a conversation is really not only welcome to those who care about the World Book Company, but also can give great encouragement to those who are encountering the same situation.</p>
<h3>Guangming Bookstore</h3>
<p>In the turbulent new publishing industry, Guangming Bookstore is the one that has been moving forward slowly like a snail for more than ten years. The establishment of Guangming was as early as the Great Revolution of 1928. It has always been at the forefront of the times and has published many new publications. Among them, reference books for various subjects in middle school, literary theory series, world literature series, social science series, biography series, single editions such as A Modern History of China, A Basic Course in Political and Economic Science, A Dictionary of Modern Language, magazine Era Forum, Literary World, have all been praised by the cultural world. After the outbreak of the August 13th all-out war of resistance, in order to promote wartime culture in the rear, the Hankou branch published a series of National Liberation series edited by Pingxin, and the Guangzhou branch planned the Free China series and Guangming Library, but they were not completed due to the fall of Guangzhou. Now, the three branches in Chongqing, Liuzhou, and Jinhua are also dedicated to promoting wartime culture. In Shanghai, they are dedicated to publishing international issues and social science theory books. It is heard that there are several books that will be published soon that are worth reporting to readers: (1) Hu Ming's translation of The Economic Geography of the Capitalist World, which is a monumental work of 500,000 words with 150 charts, which the translator completed with 18 months of painstaking effort. (2) Wang Yaosan's translation of A Course in Monetary Credit, which is a collective writing compiled by G. Katzrov, 300,000 words long. (3) Pingxin's Talks on the History of Revolutions in Various Countries, which is a nearly 200,000-word work written in one breath with the historical facts of revolutions in various countries as the backbone. These three books are not only very correct in their viewpoints, but also very novel in their writing style. They are truly rare works in the current publishing industry.</p>
<p>In terms of distribution, because of their longer history, their distribution network is also relatively broad. Now, many new publishing companies and private publications entrust them to distribute, and they have achieved good results, such as the pictorial published by the Far East Bookstore, Gambling in China by Japan, Resistance War and Revolution, the Seashore Relics edited by Fengyu Bookstore, the New Knowledge series of Jianshe, and the Public Opinion series of Gonglun Society, the Literature Monthly of Wenxian Society, etc. They can more faithfully provide the words "fast" and "cheap" to readers in the interior and to real estate agents in various places who entrust them to handle or subscribe to newspapers and books on their behalf. On the isolated island, it can be said that it is a diligent sower of cultural undertakings.</p>
<h3>Zhengzhong Bookstore</h3>
<p>Zhengzhong Bookstore was founded by famous scholars and scholars who care about cultural undertakings in China. It was established in 1933. Its purpose is to compile and print various books, introduce domestic and foreign academic studies, promote Chinese culture, and promote Chinese science and education. It aims to instill knowledge in young people so that their thoughts gradually tend to be unified. Since its opening, a large number of books and magazines have been published. To date, the former has reached more than a thousand volumes, and the latter has more than ten kinds. They are all popular in the world and have won praise from scholars across the country. In the meantime, new materials, consistent centers, precise differences, and entire plans were compiled in accordance with the standards set by the ministry, including a set of textbooks for junior high schools, senior high schools, normal schools, and simple normal schools. Since its publication, it has been praised by educators, who believe that it is a good tool for educating young people. Last year, the publication of General Chiang Kai-shek's Half-Month Record in Xi'an sold millions of copies, and the bookstore's reputation spread overseas. The bookstore initially established its headquarters in Nanjing, and branches have been established in various provinces and cities. Last year, when the war broke out and the capital fell, the bookstore moved its headquarters to Wuhan. Although it suffered heavy losses, it still worked hard to operate in hardship and continued to publish a large number of new books to meet the needs of the extraordinary period. Now, the headquarters has been moved from Wuhan to Chongqing, as the business center for the northwest and southwest. Printing factories have been set up in Chongqing and Hong Kong, each one producing books continuously. The Hong Kong factory is larger in scale, and after submitting it to the Hong Kong government for approval, it is actively working with huge production capacity, which is enough to supply the needs of the southeastern provinces and has a surplus. This is also good news for the scholars. In addition, the bookstore has also strived to enrich the branch offices in Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, etc., in order to facilitate the circulation of books in each of these places. Branch offices or sales offices have also been set up in Shanghai, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Fujian to actively supply them, hoping to fulfill their cultural responsibility during the war.</p>
<h3>Great Wall Bookstore</h3>
<p>Great Wall Bookstore was established in 1930 and was founded by people from the education and financial circles in Shanghai. It has been in existence for nine years and specializes in publishing books on youth cultivation and practical reference books. The selection of manuscripts is very strict, so the books published are very popular among educators and people from all walks of life. Such as "How to Train Yourself," "How to Study," "How to Train Your Thoughts," "Self-Creation," "Life in Soviet Russia," and other books were popular for a time, and many schools adopted them as reference books and compulsory extracurricular reading materials.</p>
<h3>Yadong Library</h3>
<p>— Wang Meng</p>
<p>Yadong Library was founded in 1913 and has a history of twenty-six years. During this period, I have no idea how many of our peers have gone from initial creation to prosperity, from prosperity to decline, and from decline to extinction; Yadong Library can still survive thousands of trials and tribulations, which is something that cannot but be gratifying.</p>
<p>The initial foundation of Yadong Library was laid in Wuhu, which is what is called the "Scientific Books Society". At that time, it was the 29th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty, and the atmosphere of reform was very vigorous. Those who were worried about the country competed to promote science as the only magic weapon for saving the country, and the establishment of the Scientific Books Society was a concrete manifestation of this trend of thought. This important cultural town in southern Anhui, the Wuhu people commonly called the "Science Map" Yadong branch, was destroyed until Wuhu fell last year.</p>
<p>Yadong is not an enterprise invested by rich merchants solely for profit, but the result of the efforts of those who are interested in cultural undertakings: therefore, in terms of publishing, it has never taken profit as the first and only standard. Therefore, in the past twenty years of Chinese culture and ideology history, Yadong Library has its own considerable position. The following are a few of the more important historical facts: After Mr. Sun Yat-sen's failure to protect the law in 1919, in view of the importance of ideological propaganda, he came to Shanghai to found the Jianshe magazine. At that time, due to environmental reasons, no bookstores would distribute it on their behalf, but only my Yadong resolutely took on the task and undertook it for two years.</p>
<p>In the literary revolution of the May Fourth Movement, Yadong did its best. The main works of new literary masters such as Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi were all published by Yadong.</p>
<p>Yadong was also a strong promoter of the rise of Chinese social sciences after 1925. The creations and introductions of Mr. Li Ji, Gao Yuhan, Lin Chaozhen, etc., also had a huge impact on social sciences in our country.</p>
<p>For example, the famous works that agitated the entire Chinese ideological world: the debate on science and outlook on life: various punctuated novels that have epoch-making significance in the history of Chinese novels, as well as more than 200 kinds of translations on archeology, natural science, and literature (many of which have been adopted as textbooks by major and medium-sized schools in China), without exception, came from the hands of famous scholars at home and abroad, and have considerable permanent value. The past efforts of Yadong Library cannot be erased by anyone.</p>
<p>However, Yadong will never limit itself to the past history, nor will it be satisfied with the achievements it has already made. Now we have a consistent policy of "only suspecting of transcending the times, and never having the disadvantage of reversing history", and hope to publish a few good books on natural science, social science, and literature and philosophy in a practical and practical way.</p>
<h3>Zhongxi Bookstore</h3>
<p>Zhongxi Bookstore was established in 1923, and the general distribution office is located between Sanma and Wangping Street. Over the years, it has published more than 500 kinds of books for various applications, such as books on crafts, books on martial arts, readers and reference books, various kinds of letters for various applications, books on Chinese and Western medicine, books on physiology and hygiene, translations of world famous books, and newly written various popular novels. Each category is compiled, printed, and published by experts. The business policy is to wholesale to the industry at a small profit, with the aim of popularizing culture, so bookstores of all sizes across the country and in various ports of Southeast Asia directly purchase and sell from the bookstore.</p>
<h3>Zhongwai Book Company</h3>
<p>Zhongwai Book Company was founded many years ago. The original site was inside the Chinese Art and Crafts Society on Avenue Édouard VII. Its main business is to photocopy Western books for schools and to handle original Western books and magazines on behalf of others. Because of the development of business, the original site was insufficient for use. Therefore, on September 18, 1937, it moved to 376 Avenue Albert and added a retail department. In order to promote the cultural undertaking, the shareholders specially increased the capital to more than 60,000 yuan, and the shareholders' meeting decided to specially hire Mr. Sheng Jitang as the general manager. Mr. Sheng was originally the manager of Lianyin Bookstore, so he has considerable experience in photocopying Western books and is enthusiastic about education and cultural undertakings. He has published and photocopied hundreds of kinds of Western books, including physics and chemistry, medicine, machinery, and many other kinds. Among them, there are more translations of reference books. Various schools have adopted them as textbooks. Detailed catalogs are available, and written or personal requests can be obtained immediately. For the convenience of people from all walks of life and school groups, the store has specially appointed dealers in Chengdu, Kunming, Chongqing, Hong Kong, Guangxi, etc. The prices are low. The retail department consigns publications from major bookstores such as Commercial Press, China Book Company, World Book Company, Kaiming, Zhengzhong, Beixin, and Niuhuo.</p>
<h3>Advice for German Language Students</h3>
<p>— Wan Chang Bookstore</p>
<p>Learning is the foundation for contributing to society, and books are the key. In this era of flourishing science, knowledge is vast and boundless, categorized and specialized. However, the publication of German books in Shanghai is quite limited, leaving readers with a sense of regret. Recognizing this, our bookstore specializes in distributing and reprinting German books to meet the needs of readers and alleviate their burden.</p>
<p>Our bookstore, originally located in Wusong, sells German books on engineering, medicine, science, chemistry, literature, and other subjects. The German textbooks used at National Tongji University are all published by our bookstore. We are grateful for the high praise from all sectors of society, who have referred to us as the "Grand Repository of German Books." However, we dare not be complacent and strive for continuous improvement to serve society and repay the kindness of all.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13th Resistance War, our bookstore has suffered heavy losses. When the National Revolutionary Army retreated westward and Tongji University relocated to Jinhua, although our bookstore suffered significant losses, we maintained our original commitment to service. We urgently bound a portion of the books stored in Shanghai and moved them with Tongji University to meet the university's needs. Subsequently, we moved with the university to Jiangxi and then to Babu in He County, Guangxi. Now, our bookstore, recognizing the urgent needs of those studying German in Shanghai, has established a branch office at 9 Fudeli Lane, 7 Chengdu Road, at the intersection of Route Foch, in addition to the Babu headquarters. We also sell textbooks and reference books for major bookstores, universities, and schools of all levels. Furthermore, we have added a printing department to provide printing services for various documents, with novel designs and prompt delivery. To further develop our business, we plan to begin this year by: (1) publishing at least one new book each month to cater to enthusiasts; (2) publishing as many recommended German classics as possible, within our capabilities; (3) printing new German textbooks for schools upon request; and (4) publishing or co-publishing outstanding works or translations related to Chinese and German by authors, which are most welcome. These few words are intended to solicit your guidance. Wishing you progress.</p>
<h3>Preface to "Disinfection of Drinking Water with Chlorine"</h3>
<p>— Cheng Muyuan</p>
<p>Alas! The function of chlorine is great indeed! It can kill people, and it can also benefit them. Its ability to kill people will not be discussed here, but its ability to benefit people can be described. We humans live on this earth, and water is one of the necessities of our daily lives. Without water, there would be no life. In the past, nomadic peoples had to live by water and grass, which shows how important water is. Given that water is so necessary for us humans, it is essential to pay close attention to the quality of the water and whether it is suitable for us. Otherwise, the harm to the public would be considerable. As evidenced by the epidemics that have occurred in Shanghai, all are closely related to water. Every time an epidemic raged, the deaths were numerous, and the terrible experiences still send shivers down our spines. However, since water plants have widely adopted chlorine disinfection, the sanitary condition of the water has greatly improved, far beyond what was possible before the use of chlorine. Therefore, although epidemics still occur, their severity has been greatly reduced, which must be attributed to chlorine. With effective prevention, the spread of bacteria in the water can be suppressed, which greatly benefits mankind. Regarding specialized books on chlorine for water disinfection, I have seen them abroad, but there have been no such publications in our country. Now, Lian Jun Kepei has spared no effort, thought deeply, and studied diligently, accomplishing what others could not, and has resolutely written this book. After reviewing it, I find it rich, accurate, and practical, with many original materials. Its content and structure are nearly unparalleled, and I greatly admire his hard work and the far-reaching significance of the book. As it is about to be published, he asked me to write a preface. Therefore, I have hastily written this to comply with his request. However, I have a strong feeling about this. The Chinese people have traditionally not paid attention to water hygiene. I sincerely hope that those who read this book can apply it in practice and make efforts to disinfect water, so that the cruel bacteria can be eliminated invisibly, and the severe epidemics can be prevented from raging. This is not only what the author deeply desires, but also a great blessing for the public.</p>

<h3>Inaugural Address</h3>
<p>— Juan</p>
<p>In this human world, every sentient being is endowed with a pair of bright, sparkling eyes. It is impossible for them not to love beautiful things. Looking up, when they see the rosy clouds in the sky, they cannot help but exclaim, "Ah, what beautiful clouds!" Seeing the mottled and bizarre cloud formations, they cannot help but exclaim, "Ah, what beautiful clouds!" After a summer rain, seeing the rainbow spanning the sky, they will dance and shout, "Look, look! This rainbow is just like a five-colored silk ribbon, how beautiful it is!" In addition, the evening sun and the moonlit night, the green waters and the verdant hills, are all materials for praise. Once they are beautified by the pens of poets, they are described even more vividly.</p>
<p>Because people are naturally fond of beauty, everyone, regardless of gender or age, knows how to decorate themselves. Natural beauty may have some unsatisfactory aspects, so they have to borrow some artificial beauty. As a result, clever scientists have invented various cosmetics to meet their needs.</p>
<p>Women's love of beauty is natural and has been so since ancient times, and it is even more intense today. This is an undeniable fact. Although the ancients had the warning of "ostentatious appearance leads to immorality," it ultimately cannot stop women from loving beauty. Therefore, the continuous innovation of cosmetics is inevitable. Worried individuals believe that women in this great era should share the responsibility of saving the nation with men and should no longer spend effort on beautification. However, loving beauty is their nature and cannot be corrected. Within possible limits, it is permissible to let them decorate themselves, as long as they do not indulge in extravagance.</p>
<p>Our publication of this beauty magazine is not to promote extravagance, but to inspire women to take beauty as the first step and then pay attention to "spiritual beauty." What is "spiritual beauty?" It is the maintenance of personality and the cultivation of morality, and it requires achieving the step of "self-respect and integrity" in addition to loving natural beauty.</p>
<h3>The "94" Standards of Feminine Beauty</h3>
<p>— KS</p>
<p>Feminine beauty is very difficult to achieve in its entirety. Even with the power of beauty and makeup, only a portion can be improved. The quest for a 'perfect beauty' seems to have been pursued for decades across ancient and modern times, yet it remains undiscovered.</p>
<p>The composition of 'perfect beauty' includes many elements, namely:</p>
<p>A. Innate</p>
<p>B. Acquired</p>
<p>C. Nutritional</p>
<p>D. Exercise-related</p>
<p>E. Educational</p>
<p>F. Decorative</p>
<p>G. Cosmetic</p>
<p>H. Other...</p>
<p>The conditions for beauty in women today belong to one of these elements. They are limited by their environment or education, preventing them from fully developing the conditions for beauty in a balanced way. This is a fact. No matter how many women you gather to choose from, the result will always be attending to one thing while neglecting another.</p>
<p>However, what should the appearance of a typical beautiful woman be like? An Arabian poet with scientific interests finally provided an answer, listing the '94' standard.</p>
<p>Here are the contents of the nine categories with four elements each:</p>
<p>A. Four Blacks: (1) Hair, (2) Eyelashes, (3) Eyebrows, (4) Pupils.</p>
<p>B. Four Whites: (1) Skin, (2) Sclera (Whites of the eyes), (3) Teeth, (4) Legs.</p>
<p>C. Four Reds: (1) Tongue, (2) Lips, (3) Gums, (4) Cheeks.</p>
<p>D. Four Round: (1) Head, (2) Neck, (3) Arms, (4) Ankles.</p>
<p>E. Four Long: (1) Back, (2) Fingers, (3) Arms, (4) Legs.</p>
<p>F. Four Wide: (1) Forehead, (2) Eyes, (3) Shoulders, (4) Hips.</p>
<p>G. Four Narrow: (1) Eyebrows, (2) Nose, (3) Lips, (4) Waist.</p>
<p>H. Four Small: (1) Ears, (2) Mouth, (3) Hands, (4) Feet.</p>
<p>I. Four Full: (1) Cheeks, (2) Legs, (3) Hips, (4) Breasts.</p>
<p>However, the nine-four standard set by the Arabian poet is only a general ideal of beauty. If a 'model' that meets this nine-four standard were placed before a painter today, the painter would certainly find it lacking, because there are many more mysterious conditions of beauty that the Arabian poet forgot.</p>
<p>Fundamental Beauty Techniques</p>
<h3>Beauty and Dietary Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Ying Gong</p>
<p>To achieve a beautiful and delicate complexion, one should focus on diet. This is the fundamental method. Pay attention to basic hygiene and the environment. Once these issues are resolved, and with the addition of scientific methods, the complexion will naturally become beautiful and delicate. For example, the diet should not be too salty. Drink a glass of boiled water before meals and eat some fruit after meals. Avoid excessive liver fire and lust, and avoid overworking the mind. Keep the residence clean. By doing so, you can be said to have fully achieved the basic methods.</p>
<p>However, although this is said, it is very difficult to achieve in reality, because most people find it difficult to control lust and overwork the mind. As a result, even before old age, the wrinkles on the forehead are like chicken skin. If not treated, it will be a significant obstacle to beauty. The treatment method is to rub a cream into the wrinkles every night, then rub horizontally with your fingers until the skin turns red. However, when rubbing, it should be gentle rather than heavy, otherwise, it will be injured. As for wrinkles around the mouth and corners of the eyes, this method should also be used, but vertical wrinkles should be rubbed horizontally, and horizontal wrinkles should be rubbed vertically. The treatment is the same for wrinkles everywhere. However, before massaging, it is necessary to steam the face with heat first. The method is to prepare a basin of boiling water, add a small spoonful of borax powder, place it on the stove, soak a neatly folded towel in it, and then press it on the face, replacing it several times to make the skin hot, lasting for ten minutes. After the skin is cleaned, the pores will gradually expand, and then use the rubbing cream, which can penetrate the pores and make the skin soft, and the wrinkles will be easily smoothed out!</p>
<p>In addition, the skin can be kept white all year round by preventing sunlight and cold wind from directly contacting the face. Therefore, in winter, to protect the complexion, it is essential to apply face cream before going out. Snow cream, which is popular recently, is one of the face creams, but it is best to choose a high-quality one. Also, avoid sweating, because sweat contains a lot of salt, which easily turns the skin black when exposed to sunlight. If you return from a long journey or under the scorching sun, use lemon juice to rub gently, then wash with clean water to remove any blackness.</p>
<h3>Beauty Requires Frequent Bathing</h3>
<p>— Xinhua</p>
<p>A person's appearance, apart from natural beauty, inevitably has many shortcomings. To correct these shortcomings, one should study beauty methods.</p>
<p>Beauty methods involve using colors such as red, yellow, black, and white to apply special techniques to the face, making the lines obvious, blurring the shadows, changing the viewer's line of sight, and making it more beautiful. There are also treatments that use drugs or surgery to change the original appearance. This is a treatment, not a beauty method. However, neither the use of colors nor drugs is a fundamental beauty method.</p>
<p>The fundamental beauty method is simple and easy to implement: frequent bathing. This method is very common, but after the famous American beautician Walker promoted it, everyone recognized that this method has the greatest effect.</p>
<p>Indeed, the physiological effect of warm water bathing has a significant meaning for the skin. We should know that there are countless blood vessels in the skin, distributed like a fine network. A large portion of our total blood volume, almost half of it, is stored in the skin. After bathing, the skin is stimulated by warmth, and the blood vessels in the skin are bound to dilate. This is enough to increase the function of skin activity, enhance the skin's resistance and endocrine function. Therefore, the pores of the skin will not be blocked, and the sweat and fat on the skin surface are easily removed. If one can bathe every day, how can the face not be beautiful?</p>
<p>Chinese women only know how to use rouge and powder excessively, but do not understand the common sense that bathing can beautify the skin, which causes the skin to be covered with dirt, which is a great mistake. It should be known that if the skin is not stimulated, the blood vessels will never dilate. At the same time, the blood vessels in the brain will also contract, and the blood circulation in the head will become stagnant. Old and waste products will accumulate and not move, which causes freckles to grow and the face to age. Even with good makeup, it is difficult to help. If one can bathe frequently, one can bring out natural beauty within a month. This fundamental beauty method not only saves the consumption of rouge and powder but also achieves physical health. Why not do it?</p>

<h3>How to Make Your Face Rosy</h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>Loving beauty is human nature, especially for women. They spend a lot of time on applying makeup every day. In fact, if makeup is used properly, it can indeed enhance beauty, but if it is not used properly, it can become ugly.</p>
<p>A beautiful face is often considered to be rosy, as for what kind of face shape, such as oval, melon seed, or round, I don't think it matters much. As long as you can style your hair properly, and the tailoring and colors of your clothes are well-matched, you will be admired.</p>
<p>But then again, we still rely on artificial means to beautify ourselves effectively. The usual beauty techniques involve applying foundation with powder or snow cream, then applying fragrant powder, then applying rouge, and then applying fragrant powder again, and adding lipstick. This can be said to be a powdered beauty, but it is not yet a jade carving, and it does not have the moving beauty of being red-wrapped and white, or white with a reddish glow.</p>
<p>If you want your face to be white, delicate, and rosy, you can use the following methods:</p>
<p>(1) Every morning when you wake up, rub your face with both hands fifty or sixty times.</p>
<p>(2) After washing your face, apply human milk to your face and wash it off after five minutes.</p>
<p>(3) Every night, apply egg white (that is, egg white) and wash it off after fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>(4) Before going to bed, rub your face fifty or sixty times, and then apply pure honey water and high-quality palace powder.</p>
<p>(5) The face powder used must be high-quality and lead-free fragrant powder.</p>
<p>If you follow the above methods and implement them continuously every day, you will see results in a year and a half.</p>
<h3>Fat and Thin</h3>
<p>— Gu Chunxu</p>
<p>—Pay attention to food intake—</p>
<p>Everyone knows that being too thin or too fat is a great disadvantage to beauty. Therefore, the first basic step in seeking beauty is to figure out how to make yourself neither fat nor thin, and meet the standards of health and beauty. According to medical experts, a person's weight has a lot to do with what they eat every day. Therefore, if you feel that you are too fat or too thin, you only need to pay attention to what you eat to help treat obesity or thinness.</p>
<p>(1) Thinning method: Thin people should eat more fatty meat, grilled meat (slightly raw), lard, chicken oil, olive oil, cream, white tower, eggs, soup, bread crusts, noodles, sweets, etc. In terms of fruits, you should eat more fatty ones such as almonds, walnuts, coconuts, chestnuts, dates, and olives. Certain vegetables such as cabbage, spinach, radishes, and tomatoes should not be eaten too much. Smoking is strictly forbidden.</p>
<p>(2) Obesity treatment method: The only method to treat obesity is to eat less. In particular, you must avoid the following types of fatty foods: fatty meat, butter, and all foods sold in butcher shops. Among fish, you should also avoid eating seawater fish such as sardines and squid. Other foods to avoid include soy sauce, foods containing starch, pastries, chocolates, candies, juices, beer, spirits, and yellow wine.</p>
<p>Treating obesity and thinness is not very difficult. As long as you can be patient and determined, and weigh yourself every week, the effectiveness will be seen.</p>
<h3>The Three Movements of Beauty</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>"Loving beauty" is human nature, especially for young girls. Although the old feudal idea of "a woman dresses for the one who pleases her" has long been eliminated by the times, in any different environment, every woman seems to need to maintain her feminine beauty. Now, the three movements of beauty for women of the era (1) face (2) hands and feet (3) body are briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) Face: Facial beauty is more important than any other part, so never let dirt or grease get into the pores. When washing, you should use a towel with a texture suitable for the size of the pores to wipe it clean, and then apply some beauty lotion or moisturizer. Special attention should also be paid to the use of lipstick and rouge. If you apply some deep red color of rouge on your face, it will not only not feel beautiful, but will instead be like a monkey's kidney, making people disgusted. Therefore, the rouge should be applied evenly and lightly. It is decided that the eyebrows should not be too straight, causing a fierce look, nor should they be too drooping, which will make you look sad. It is best to apply some eye shadow for a better look.</p>
<p>(2) Hands and feet: The hands often secrete oil and sweat without being noticed, so they should be wiped off with a soft towel at any time, and then apply some almond honey or moisturizer. The decoration of the fingers should maintain natural beauty. Truly beautiful and generous women do not like to apply nail polish. The beauty of the "feet" is roughly the same as that of the "hands," but it is very unsightly to dye the toes with red and green colors, because this can easily be mistaken for a fallen woman.</p>
<p>(3) Body: The fat and thinness of the body is very related to "feminine beauty." Being too fat or too thin is unacceptable. Therefore, if you find that your body is too fat, it is because you are eating too much all day long and lacking exercise. Therefore, fitness exercises are necessary. If you find that your body is too thin, then nutrition should be sufficient and labor should not be excessive. This is the secret to turning a weak body into a strong one. Also, taking a bath often is also an important element in maintaining feminine beauty. When bathing, glycerin soap and bath salts are indispensable. Then, scrub carefully with a sponge or loofah, and finally gently apply beauty lotion. This will definitely make the skin smooth and delicate.</p>

<h3>Beauty Experiences</h3>
<p>— Jiaren</p>
<p>People's views vary from Chinese to foreign people. Foreigners consider yellow hair to be beautiful, so-called "blonde beauties." However, the Chinese consider black hair to be beautiful, because black hair is shiny, which is more than enough to set off the whiteness of the skin. However, many Chinese people have yellow hair. If you want to turn it black, you can wash it daily with water soaked in several sheets of wild vegetable leaves. After two or three times, it can gradually turn black.</p>
<p>If the pores on the face are too large, after washing your face every morning, you can use skin-tightening beauty water, pour it into a small cotton pad, and wipe the face around to tighten the skin's pores. The preparation method of beauty water can use "potassium alum" five grams, "Cologne alcohol" eight hundred cc, and "orange blossom water" one hundred and ninety-five cc.</p>
<p>People with thin faces should apply rouge between the nose and cheekbones. People with round faces should apply rouge on the cheekbones, and should not apply it near the nose.</p>
<p>For men and women with protruding foreheads, if you want to cover up their shape, you can only rely on makeup. When applying makeup, you can apply powder evenly elsewhere, but you can choose not to apply it on the forehead. This will make it feel much flatter. If you mix a little blue into the powder, you can also cover up the shape. This is completely based on optical principles and is indeed effective.</p>
<h3>Lip Makeup</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>In today's society with open communication, the makeup of girls' faces is indeed a matter that cannot be ignored; especially the makeup on the lips, which is even more important. Because all facial movements are expressed through the mouth and eyes. In Western European countries, where the custom of kissing men and women prevails, the lips are even more important.</p>
<p>Most women seem to have very little cultivation in applying lipstick, and very few understand the art of applying lipstick. They simply apply it all over their mouths, making it look like blood, which makes people disgusted. Therefore, I specifically wrote the method of lip makeup for readers to refer to. After applying the powder on the face, first rub the upper and lower lips with a piece of scented honey several times, then apply the lipstick on the upper lip. After applying the lipstick on the upper lip, close your lips tightly and touch the lipstick on the upper lip to cover the lower lip. Then, use a brush to gradually smooth it evenly according to the position of the lipstick applied, and then cover the lips with a piece of silk cloth rich in water absorption to let it absorb the color that is too bright red, making it a color that is red but not bright, and light but not strong. This is success.</p>
<p>Everyone's lips must have different widths and thicknesses. The above lipstick application method refers to lips that generally meet the standard of beauty. If your lips are suffering from the problem of thickness or narrowness, then you have to perform a cosmetic surgery.</p>
<p>If your lips are too thick, you can apply lipstick on the inside of the edge of the lips, and at the same time apply a dark-colored lipstick on the inside of the lips, so that it will not appear too thick.</p>
<p>If your lips are too thin, you can use lipstick to lengthen the lip skin and apply light red inside. If your lips are too big, you should apply dark lipstick on the inside of the lips, and at the same time shorten the length of the lipstick on the corners of the mouth. Apply light-colored lipstick to form a properly sized lip, so that it will not feel too large.</p>
<p>With these methods, it is not difficult to get a skillful skill on the makeup of other deformed lips. As long as you carefully consider the length and angle, and carefully use lipsticks in dark colors, no matter how deformed the lips are, they can be transformed into standard beautiful lips.</p>
<h3>Eye Makeup</h3>
<p>— Xinhua Yu</p>
<p>—The Relationship of Eyelashes—</p>
<p>"Beautiful eyes and a charming smile," "A smile that can overthrow cities," which shows that beautiful eyes are the most important condition for beauty; "If you want beauty, you must first have beautiful eyes," is also a self-evident motto in beauty. The makeup of beautiful eyes is concisely written below.</p>
<p>If you want your eyes to be beautiful, you must use eyelashes to set them off. To set off the eyelashes, you must use a kind of emphasis color. This color is called mascara. When applying it, use a small brush, lightly dip a little mascara, and slowly brush it on the eyelashes, thicker on the upper eyelashes and lighter on the lower eyelashes. However, when performing this technique, the mouth must be opened, otherwise the eyelids will flash and close constantly, and the mascara will be applied to the eyelids, which will take time to wipe off and is too uneconomical.</p>
<p>After drawing the eyelashes, draw a fine line on the lower side of the lower eyelid. This line is very laborious. The line should be slightly lighter in the center of the eyelid, slightly thicker near the ear, and lighter on both sides near the bridge of the nose than in the center. After drawing, use your little finger to rub the lines and lines together, so that the outline of the cheek fat and the lines blend together. In this way, the beauty of beautiful eyes and a charming smile can be brought into play.</p>
<p>This kind of makeup technique must rely on your own surgery. If you go to consult a beauty salon, then you will be like a certain girl whose face turned into hemp skin, and you will be involved in a lawsuit, which is unnecessary.</p>
<h3>Teeth and Beauty</h3>
<p>— Lu Dehong</p>
<p>Protecting your teeth is also a part of beauty, because it not only directly enhances the beauty of your face, but also indirectly promotes your physical health, making your complexion rosy and your skin clean and delicate. With these two basic conditions, plus your regular features, then your beauty problem, without much research or discussion, you are already the reincarnation of Song Yu or Pan An, even Xi Shi can't compare to your beauty. Therefore, this kind of beauty method that achieves twice the result with half the effort and has extremely significant effects, I think readers should all pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Before talking about how to protect your teeth, let's first introduce the teeth of a few movie stars. Loretta Young goes to the dentist every week to have a check-up. She asks the doctor to check if she has any misalignments that don't meet dental standards. Marjorie Weaver has a private dentist who checks her every two weeks. She doesn't suffer from dental diseases either, she asks the dentist how to maintain her pearly white teeth. Diana Durbin's mother said: When Durbin was three years old, I tried my best to pay attention to her teeth, so that she would grow up with a healthy and beautiful set of teeth. This is just a casual introduction of a few examples. Almost all the red stars on the Hollywood silver screen have their teeth checked at least once a month. From this, it can be seen that their emphasis on teeth is self-evident. When we see them smile on the screen, revealing a set of white and neat teeth, we can't help but feel a little envious, but there is no need to be envious, here I can introduce you to an effective method of protecting teeth.</p>
<p>In addition to a few common basic conditions for protecting dental hygiene, it is best to implement all of the following, then it is not difficult for your teeth to reach the standard.</p>
<p>(1) Daily precautions:</p>
<p>1.  Be sure to rinse your mouth and brush your teeth after getting up and after each meal. When brushing, be sure to brush up and down, not left and right randomly, so that residual dirt and grime cannot be completely wiped away, because the grime often contains acidity, which can destroy the enamel of the teeth and cause various dental diseases.</p>
<p>2.  Do not eat excessively hard, sweet, sour, cold, or hot irritating foods, because excessively hard foods easily injure teeth, which is very dangerous. Excessively sweet and sour foods easily produce acidity, and excessively cold and hot foods easily irritate and contract the teeth, resulting in symptoms that damage the dental nerves at different heights, front and back.</p>
<p>3.  Do not use toothpaste, tooth powder, or various substitutes (such as mouthwash, etc.) of poor quality, because poor quality stain removers often contain too much acid. Toothpaste is easy to use, but it is also easy to damage teeth, so you should try to avoid using it. It is best to use fruit juice, such as apple juice.</p>
<p>4.  Do not use hard-bristled toothbrushes, but use soft and moderate ones. In addition to the toothbrush used for brushing teeth, prepare a small brush (available at Western pharmacies) to brush the concave seams between the teeth and places that cannot be reached by the large brush.</p>
<p>5.  Do not eat too much, because overeating often leads to teeth grinding in dreams (commonly known as teeth chattering); because overeating is not easy to digest, and indigestion causes the above symptoms and damages the teeth.</p>
<p>6.  The only way to correct the height, front and back, and unevenness of teeth is to consult a dentist, because they have special and sophisticated instruments, but adults are not as easy to correct as young children, so parents should always pay attention to their children's teeth. In short, the impact of teeth on appearance, there is no need to explain as above, it is already very clear. I remember not long ago, it was fashionable in Shanghai to inlay gold teeth and Indian-style emerald heart teeth, but now they have been almost completely eliminated, but thinking about it carefully, they also used teeth to beautify their appearance.</p>
<h3>How to Avoid Skin Wrinkles</h3>
<p>— Jinghua</p>
<p>In winter, when the northwest wind rises, the skin will wrinkle and crack. What is the reason for this? It turns out that the reason why the skin is elastic and soft is that the fat under the skin constantly supplies nutrients to the skin. When the skin is nourished by this fat, it naturally shows fullness and elasticity on the epidermis. In winter, after the subcutaneous fat is blown by the northwest wind, it cannot function as vigorously as in warm weather. Because the subcutaneous fat cannot fully perform its function, the metabolism of the skin is also affected and hindered. Therefore, the skin wrinkles and cracks in winter.</p>
<p>The richness and elasticity of the skin is a necessary condition for beauty, and wrinkles and cracks in the skin are enough to destroy this beauty. To avoid wrinkles and cracks in the skin, the method is very simple, and there is no need to spend a lot of money to buy elaborate glycerin and powder creams to apply. What I want to introduce is honey or milk curd.</p>
<p>Honey can be bought for a few cents at Chinese herbal medicine stores; milk curd includes cow's milk or human milk, but cow's milk is better and easier to obtain. Just leave the leftovers, which is enough to use. These two things can provide the skin with extremely good nutrition and can make the skin's metabolism flourish. It is really the best cosmetic to avoid skin wrinkles. The method of use is enough to apply three or four times a week, too much is not suitable. The time of application should be more convenient before going to bed at night. Before applying, wash your face clean, and then apply a thin layer of diluted honey or milk liquid. After doing this several times, you will definitely get considerable results.</p>
<p>In addition, more exercise of the face can also reduce the state of skin wrinkling; but how to exercise the face? This is also very simple. When talking and laughing, make some facial expressions, such as making a face... which is the method of facial exercise.</p>

<h3>Standard Beauty Technique</h3>
<p>— Zhitong</p>
<p>What is the standard beauty technique? In my opinion, the first thing is to use domestic products. Even if you use imported cosmetics, it can't be considered beautiful! Secondly, is the selection of materials. Among domestic products, the Wuzhou Pharmacy, with its pharmaceutical experience, produces several kinds of cosmetics, which are generally considered to be very exquisite. The following cosmetic procedures can be used as a reference for ladies:</p>
<p>(1) Washing the face: Use "Guben Soap" to wash away the dirt on the face, and the skin will immediately feel comfortable.</p>
<p>(2) Brushing teeth: After washing the face, brush your teeth with "Wuzhou 131 Toothpaste". The teeth are white and the mouth is refreshed.</p>
<p>(3) Applying honey: Apply a little bit of Planet Brand "Skin Nourishing Pure Honey" on various parts of the hands and face to stimulate blood circulation and moisturize the skin.</p>
<p>(4) Applying cream: Then apply "Yipin Xiang Xuehua Cream" on the face to make the complexion fair, shiny and smooth.</p>
<p>(5) Arranging the hair: Finally, sprinkle "131 Fragrant Hair Water" on the hairline and comb it with a comb. The fragrance is rich.</p>
<p>According to the above method, not only is the purpose of beauty achieved, but also the responsibility of using domestic products is fulfilled, which is called the standard beauty technique. Who says it is not suitable?</p>
<h3>From Beauty to Strengthening the Body</h3>
<p>— Xinsheng</p>
<p>Beauty only refers to the appearance, while strengthening the body refers to the entire body, which seems not to be confused.</p>
<p>However, the current era is no longer an era that only values ​​appearance and does not value the body. In the eyes of most people, undoubtedly, only healthy and beautiful women and men can be regarded as typical women and men.</p>
<p>In the novels of the past: Jia Baoyu, with a face like powder, and Lin Daiyu, who was weak and frail, these characters representing male and female beauty have become historical relics and have become outdated!</p>
<p>Therefore, fitness and beauty really need to be discussed side by side. In other words, it is necessary to have a beautiful appearance and also pay attention to the health of the body. Moreover, a strong body naturally leads to a plump, beautiful and lovely face.</p>
<p>The only way to fitness is to replenish the body with nutrients. To replenish the body with nutrients, you must take effective tonics. The most famous tonics in modern times are the following:</p>
<p>(1) Artificial Automatic Blood, it has been popular for decades and has always been trusted and praised by users. Its efficacy is to specifically replenish the body's precious blood. Therefore, if someone has a pale complexion and suffers from anemia and weakness, their complexion will turn rosy after taking Automatic Blood for a month, and the various symptoms caused by anemia will gradually heal.</p>
<p>(2) Wuzhou Milk White Cod Liver Oil is made with the latest manufacturing machinery and has been rigorously tested. The vitamins it contains to nourish the human body are accurate and abundant, reaching the top. Drinking it will expand the lungs and develop muscles.</p>
<p>(3) Earth Brand Malt Cod Liver Oil is sweet and palatable, with no fishy smell at all. Everyone can take it. It can replenish deficiency and treat the lungs. Its efficacy is very certain and has long been well-known, because cod liver oil and malt paste are both ingredients that are rich in vital elements.</p>
<p>Select and take the above three tonics, and you will be strong, energetic, and able to achieve your wish for fitness and beauty.</p>
<h3>Advantages of 131 Toothpaste</h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>Wuzhou 131 Toothpaste is made with special ingredients containing dirt removal, stain removal, sterilization and disinfection. The material is pure and the smell is fragrant. Cleaning teeth is the purpose of using it, and oral disinfection also has a main function. It is really a necessary hygiene product for protecting teeth and cleaning the mouth. Now, let me briefly describe the characteristics of its ingredients and combination:</p>
<p>(1) "Calcium carbonate" is the main raw material of general toothpaste. This product is no exception, but the calcium carbonate selected is crystalline powder that can pass through a 140-eye sieve, and transparent particles can be observed under a 500x microscope.</p>
<p>(2) "Magnesium Milk" is an extremely fine colloidal emulsion made by digesting magnesium oxide. The light return is sufficient to neutralize the acidity caused by the fermentation of food residues left in the tooth gaps. It is another major ingredient in 131 toothpaste for cleaning teeth.</p>
<p>(3) "Base Agent" Astragalus gum is extremely gentle and non-irritating. It is used together with the Chinese Pharmacopoeia starch glycerin to form a thick, soft and transparent gelatinous substance. Its thickness does not change over the years. When rubbing the teeth, it can also play a lubricating role without the use of soap. Therefore, 131 toothpaste uses this type of base agent.</p>
<p>(4) "Disinfectant" Thymol, methyl salicylate, eugenol, phenyl salicylate are mixed with menthol, etc., to form an aromatic bactericidal disinfectant. 131 Spearhead toothpaste contains this kind of medicine in its fragrance. The main purpose of gargling after use is for oral disinfection, and its fragrance is only secondary.</p>
<p>(5) "Features of Preparation" The substantive filling materials used in 131 toothpaste, such as the above-mentioned calcium and magnesium, exert the effect of cleaning teeth by means of wiping, just like stain removal powder wiping porcelain. If these substances are selected carelessly, they will damage the tooth enamel. Now, we use crystalline calcium carbonate with a 140-eye sieve and colloidal magnesium milk. The hardness is always between 3 and 3.5, which is a degree of distance from the tooth enamel hardness of 4 to 4.5. Therefore, there is absolutely no disadvantage of damaging the tooth enamel. It is the only 131 toothpaste that can quickly remove stains without making noise when used. It is the most special of its characteristics.</p>

<h3>Skin Beauty and Tooth Beauty</h3>
<p>— Ai</p>
<p>Modern ladies believe that using soap is a very important thing, because the skin has to come into contact with soap every morning and evening. If inferior soap is used, the skin will suffer adverse damage!</p>
<p>"Guben Soap" is a valuable soap. Its quality and fragrance are above those of imported products. It is suitable for washing the face and bathing. It can make the skin undergo a kind of metabolism, and there is no harm of irritation. Therefore, using "Guben Soap" at night is to give the skin insurance.</p>
<p>The teeth of a person not only have the function of chewing, but also occupy a very important position in the appearance. When talking and smiling, the teeth must be revealed, so we must pay attention to beautifying the teeth as deeply as the other parts.</p>
<p>Brushing your teeth with "Wuzhou 131 Toothpaste" fills your mouth with foam, which is fragrant and palatable. After use, your teeth are clean, white, shiny and lovely.</p>
<h3>Talking about the Manufacturing Process of Guben Soap</h3>
<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>The "Guben Laundry Soap" produced by Wuzhou Guben Soap is famous throughout the country. The "Guben Soap" produced is of excellent quality and has a clear and elegant fragrance. It is a popular domestic soap. Now, let me talk about the process of manufacturing it: "The oils used by Guben Soap are slightly different from those used by Guben Household Soap. Generally, it is mainly composed of tallow, coconut oil, and castor oil. The manufacturing method is the same as that of making laundry soap. It is to first mix the oils and alkalize them to make lime soap, but another boiler is used for cooking. After the soap is made, it is injected into a soap rolling and cooling machine to condense it into blocks, then cut into long strips, and the strips are placed in a glass vacuum room for bleaching. After several months of long time, wait for it to be clean and white. When it is about to be used, move it to a drying room with a rotating device. There is a slicing machine on the upper part of the room. Take the clean and white long strips of soap and put them into the slicing machine, slice them into flakes, and then spread them on several layers of copper wire mesh in the room by the rotating device and bake them. After one or two hours, move a certain amount of soap into the mixing machine, add spices and pigments, and turn on the wheels to stir it for one hour. Move it into the grinder and repeat it several times. After the spices and pigments are very mixed, move it into the rotating pushing machine. Its interior is like a spiral shaft, and the soap is rolled out by the spiral. Its products can replace various models, so you can make round or square shapes from the pushing machine. The long strips are cut into small pieces with a separator, and then moved to a printing car for printing and placed in a shallow wooden grid and moved to another vacuum drying room. After drying, after a week of a long time, it is sent to the packaging room to be packaged into boxes and can be sold.</p>
<p>The reason why Wuzhou Guben Household Soap can be of good quality and popular is because it is manufactured using the Gerlach-Beetz indirect method, which cannot be compared with the direct method in which other factories only mix oil and caustic soda; the manufacturing process of "Guben Soap" also uses the same super-special method, and it is no wonder that its products are extraordinary.</p>

<h3>Beauty Storm</h3>
<p>— Qiaoming</p>
<p>Many leaves fall in the corners, gradually fading from withered green to scorched yellow, and the water splashed on the ground freezes into ice in a moment. This symbolizes that the severe winter is extending its power.</p>
<p>This is Mr. Chen's home, and a small storm suddenly broke out. The reason is - Mr. Chen bought back a bottle of skin care products, and he handed it to his wife with great pride.</p>
<p>"Did you buy it back? How much does a bottle cost?" the wise Mrs. Chen asked.</p>
<p>"One dollar and twenty cents a bottle," Mr. Chen replied.</p>
<p>"A small bottle of something costs one dollar and twenty cents? Too expensive! Too expensive!"</p>
<p>"It's a time-honored foreign brand. The quality is very good."</p>
<p>"Are you a foreign goods worshiper?" Mrs. Chen immediately darkened her face. She said sternly: "In this era, everyone knows to promote domestic goods, but you want to be a salesperson for foreign goods. You know that foreign goods are good, but do you know that domestic goods have been improving very quickly over the years? Besides, putting foreign goods on your face, even if it's beautiful, it's still ugly. You can abandon the root and pursue the tip, but I can't make a fool of myself!"</p>
<p>Mr. Chen was speechless by Mrs. Chen.</p>
<p>A few days later, Mrs. Chen went to the Wuzhou Pharmacy and bought a one-pound can of beauty cream back.</p>
<p>"Look! This is a domestic product. It only costs 75 cents and can be used by our whole family for a winter," Mrs. Chen said proudly.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen did not speak. He was obviously defeated in this storm!</p>

<h3>A Scene of Fragrant Hair</h3>
<p>— Pinghou</p>
<p>Love is human nature, especially for young girls in general, they are of course the love of love.</p>
<p>Xiao Lei is also one of the loving girls. She has cultivated her temperament to be so lively, she has exercised her body to be so beautiful and healthy, and she has repaired her appearance to be so beautiful! She is a flower, a pure and lovely flower.</p>
<p>One day, Manna - Xiao Lei's friend - walked into Xiao Lei's bedroom. Xiao Lei was just preparing to go out. He was holding a bottle of fragrant hair water and sprinkling it on his head.</p>
<p>"Sister Lei"!</p>
<p>"Is that Sister Manna? Where did you come from?"</p>
<p>"I just came back from visiting the domestic goods market. You smell really good!" Manna said with a smile while holding Xiao Lei's hand. "Yes, it smells very good. This is a bottle of high-quality fragrant hair water that I bought from a department store the day before yesterday," Xiao Lei said as he showed Manna the bottle of "Red-Clad Man Fragrant Hair Water" in her hand.</p>
<p>"Is this fragrant hair water really high-quality? But sprinkling it on your head doesn't necessarily mean it's a glorious fragrance! Because you've already become an unpatriotic person."</p>
<p>"I also know that using foreign goods will cause the outflow of rights and interests. However, it seems that only foreign goods are good for things like fragrant hair..."</p>
<p>"Sister Lei: You're wrong! Do you know that domestic goods have been improving very quickly in recent years? Even for cosmetics like fragrant hair water, there are good ones among domestic goods, but you just haven't looked for them. Why do you always have to be superstitious about foreign goods?…"</p>
<p>Manna said so solemnly, and Xiao Lei was greatly moved. She smashed the bottle in her hand heavily on the ground, indicating that she would never be superstitious about foreign goods from now on.</p>
<p>A few days later, Xiao Lei was very newly emerging in finding a domestic fragrant hair water that satisfied her. The one she found was the "131 Fragrant Hair Water" exquisitely produced by Wuzhou Pharmacy.</p>

<h3>Beauty New Secrets</h3>
<p>— Zhi Xi</p>
<p>To Make Skin Tender: Before applying any makeup each day, first soak paper in cold water, wring it out gently so it is not too wet, and apply it to the face. This causes the skin to contract in the cold. Then, apply cucumber juice or loofah juice (a plant-based makeup water can be made by chopping fresh cucumber or loofah, wrapping it in silk cloth, and squeezing out the juice. After it settles, drip some into your palm and rub it on your face). This will not only prevent the skin from becoming rough, but will also make it fine, tender, and smooth.</p>
<p>For Oily and Rosy Cheeks: Generally, people with oily faces have excessive sebum secretion. Rub your face daily with a fat-free makeup water to gradually stretch the skin and gently stimulate the skin tissues, which will reduce the oiliness. The method is as follows: First, soak a towel in hot water and moisten the face. Then, add a few drops of apple dew and honey to your palm, rub them together, and pat onto your face. Wait for it to dry, then soak alum (available in pharmacies) in water and gently rub it on your face once. This will make the skin rosy.</p>
<p>For Sweaty Faces: For sweaty faces, first wash with apple cider vinegar, then mix two parts of alum, one part of Tian Hua powder, and five parts of talc. Mix with water each morning and apply once to naturally reduce sweating.</p>
<p>Eliminating Wrinkles: Young women's skin tissues are firm and dense. If wrinkles appear on the face, first wash your face with cold water to stimulate the skin, then rub it with a rough cloth until the face becomes red and hot. Alternatively, rubbing with milk and honey can also eliminate wrinkles.</p>
<p>Purple-Black Complexion: A purple-black complexion is caused by poor blood circulation. Taking arsenic pills regularly can make the skin whiter and more tender. However, avoid drinking tea before and after taking arsenic pills, and pay close attention.</p>
<p>Rough Lips: Rough lips are unsightly. Mix one part talc, two parts Resorcinol, and five parts gum arabic with five parts distilled water. Apply once after washing your face each time to make the lips fine and rosy.</p>
<p>The above methods are all derived from experimentation. Ladies and misses of the era, feel free to try them; they are sure to be effective.</p>
<p>A Casual Talk on Makeup</p>
<p>— Song Guang</p>
<p>Modern women's understanding of makeup is limited to knowing how to apply powder, rouge, or at most, lipstick. Some other women think that makeup must be dramatic and exaggerated, like a theatrical actor's heavy makeup, but both of these are erroneous views.</p>
<p>When women are in the makeup section, they are often tempted by the decoration and fragrance of the cosmetics, forgetting to distinguish the quality of the powder, rouge, and lipstick. At the same time, they forget to consider whether the colors suit their own complexion, because inferior quality products often cause adverse reactions when applied to the face. - Powder lacking water absorption will turn into a pasty film when exposed to sweat. Powder containing starch will swell when wet with sweat, causing blotches on the face. It may also fail to adhere firmly to the skin and easily fall off, so it must be repeatedly applied. After repeated application, the powder layer accumulates unevenly. Therefore, using this kind of inferior powder not only fails to achieve the effect of makeup, but also makes the face unattractive. A powder color that does not match one's skin tone also ruins the natural beauty of the face.</p>
<p>Ladies and misses! You already know that women should use powder, rouge, etc. to apply makeup, but what is the meaning of makeup? In a narrow sense, makeup is a technical and artistic method of achieving beauty. In a broad sense, makeup is to cater to one's skin tone conditions, using the harmony of cosmetic colors to enhance natural beauty.</p>
<p>Now that we understand the meaning of makeup, of course we should start applying makeup - let me show you step by step:</p>
<p>The steps for applying powder should start from the lower part of the cheeks, gradually reaching the center of the face, and finally applying to the nose. The most important thing to pay attention to is the area between the nose and cheeks. If the powder is not applied firmly, it is easy to reveal the original skin tone. However, applying too much powder is also a problem. Therefore, the powder in the area between the nose and cheeks should be thicker than other parts. It is important to pay attention to the size relationship of the face. For people with large face shapes, the contours of the face should be applied with dark powder. For people with narrow faces, the area where the nose and eyes meet should be applied with light powder.</p>
<p>After completing the powdering process, you should tidy up a bit. Use a powder brush to gently brush away the powder that is too thick in various places. This will make it look even, soft, and more beautiful.</p>
<p>The most taboo thing when applying rouge is "smearing." Because smearing rouge on seems too stiff. Therefore, when applying rouge, it should be patted on slowly, from dark to light, in an arc shape, looking like a natural embellishment.</p>
<p>The patting sequence should start from the upper tip of the cheeks, move along the curve of the cheekbones, and gradually towards the eye near the nose and cheeks. Some should also be patted on the orbital bone to make the obvious edges disappear. This looks just like a natural blush, very lovely.</p>
<p>"Lips are the windows of speech." Therefore, lips are kind, gentle, passionate, and full of infinitely sweet memories. They often contain the characteristics of strong emotional impulses and are even strangely flavorful, evoking reverie and mysterious allure.</p>
<p>When applying lipstick, you should first wipe your lips dry with a soft towel, because lipstick will only adhere to dry lips. Then, apply it according to the contour of the lip shape. Next, close your lips tightly and imprint the lipstick already applied on the upper lip onto the lower lip. Then, dab and smear the lipstick up and down. Isn't it symmetrical this way?</p>
<p>After finishing the lipstick work, you should take care of the corners of the mouth or the edges of the lips to make the lines disappear. At the same time, use your index finger to even out the lipstick on the upper and lower lips. Finally, moisten your lips, then showing a bright and dazzling luster.</p>
<p>If you want to make your eyes look a little better, you have to trim your eyebrows. Eyebrows should be neither too long nor too short. It is not advisable to use an eyebrow machine to curl them, otherwise you will not only fail to please but also cause trouble. But even if they are curled, you cannot help but trim them.</p>
<p>As for drawing eyebrows, you should first gently apply eyeshadow cream to the upper eyelid, from the eyelashes to the eyebrows, so that it has a layer of crisp and tender radiance. When drawing eyebrows, the eyebrow pencil must move along the natural curve. When the eyebrows are slightly drawn, they should be extended slightly, which is truly endearing.</p>
<p>If you also like to draw eyeliner, you can gently apply a little darker eyeshadow along the eyelashes. When drawing, you must fade it out around to be natural, not too stiff, like the cartoonish black circles of Chinese movie star Tan Ying.</p>

<h3>Beauty Magic</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Have you ever seen women whose faces sag? Their mouths tilt at the corners, their cheeks are flabby, their eyes are tired. In fact, their faces show a completely tired appearance. Even young faces can have thin and weak muscles. Sometimes this weakness is limited to one area, such as the mouth or lower eyelids. Cosmetic surgeons can use surgical methods to tighten the facial skin and correct cosmetic abnormalities. They call it a "face lift," but unfortunately, the treatment is not always effective and scares many women away. We cannot blame timid women for being afraid to take risks to correct very small flaws. In Hollywood, a new method has recently been invented to lift tired and sagging faces - this method is harmless and easy, a new beauty magic.</p>
<p>Sagging Mouth, for example, a common sagging mouth can make the appearance stubborn and angry. You only need to think that an angry expression requires three times more muscle movement than a smile to know why women with angry expressions look tired. Deep grooves at the corners of the mouth are a sign of being pushed down. Many women use powder to stop it, and the defect occurs because the recessed part always lacks powder. The result is a dark and invisible dimple that remains next to the corners of the mouth. Another thing that often happens, especially when women are in a hurry, is to apply lipstick in the recesses, which looks so untidy and depressed!</p>
<p>Raising the Mouth: But let's pay attention to the treatment method. What is the most appropriate way to correct a sagging mouth? First, when this kind of woman applies powder, she has to open her mouth, and the corners of her mouth will be tightened. In this way, even those recessed places can be powdered. Then use lipstick, and the corner of the lower lip should be painted longer, exceeding the corner of the upper lip. The reason for this is obvious. The reason for sagging is that the corner of the upper lip exceeds the length of the corner of the lower lip. Therefore, if we shorten the length of the upper lip, we can eliminate the hanging of the mouth. However, when you use lipstick, you must wipe away the excess powder. It is very important to apply powder to all downward-pushing lines around the mouth, and then brush away with a powder brush. You can use your fingers to stretch these lines so that the powder can be applied and made invisible. When applying lipstick, you should often use very little to avoid making it noticeably visible in the mouth area.</p>
<p>Facial Muscles: Unfortunately, flabby cheeks have become a difficult problem. It is not easy to raise them alone. This is entirely due to the weakness of the muscles. The more serious ones cannot be corrected. The usual method is to harmonize the muscles and skin. For example, rubbing with ice can strengthen the muscles. Regularly using cold towels is also a good method. This procedure should be completed five minutes before applying high-quality moisturizing cream. When using moisturizing cream, the muscles of the face do not need to be pulled. Moisturizing cream should be gently patted into the skin. Any facial movement, whether up or down, can stretch and weaken the muscles. After the face is pulled upward, this method will no longer be effective. However, regularly using skin-moisturizing creams can also strengthen the facial muscles. Using good moisturizing cream can also cover up the defect of flabby facial muscles. If moisturizing cream and rouge are applied in an artistic way, the defects can even be completely removed. Because rouge seems like</p>

<p>a covering, it can cleverly conquer the entire cheek. Softness and intelligence mixed together can create the illusion you desire.</p>
<p>Raising the Eyes: Now, we</p>
<p>are going to talk about the so-called "windows of the soul." Tired, depressed eyes are usually caused by the lower eyelids seeming to have bugs crawling on them. Dark circles under the eyes are often discovered at the same time. If you sleep a few more hours, these dark circles will not be removed, but they will fade a little. The muscles around the eyes should also be often treated with moisturizing cream to make the eyes look higher. Here is a very funny method: use an eyebrow pencil to draw a light outer line along the circumference of the eyelids. This line is then slowly stretched, crossing the outer corner of the eye and slightly upward. The eyebrows are also the same, slightly upward. Small lines and wrinkles around the eyes can also show a tired appearance. This can usually be stretched and hidden when applying powder, but the result is that the powder falls off. The powder brush can brush away any excess powder that is applied in any place.</p>
<h3>Lily</h3>
<p>— Li Jun</p>
<p>It was early in the morning when the sun had just flashed onto the silver-white bed frame of Chloe, Miss Lily, the queen of the S Church School, had already gotten up. She was wearing a pink morning gown and standing in front of the dressing table, with her slender and curvaceous back in tow.</p>
<p>After washing her face, she did not immediately do her beauty routine, but only smiled faintly at the large pile of bottles of different sizes placed in front of her. The smile made her see herself in the reflection of the mirror and feel that she was too beautiful. Really, she was too beautiful. Just her two lips were redder than the Western rouge cream that Little Sun sent. No wonder the male students wanted to elect her as queen. During this festive season, she had received so many gifts: imported perfumes! Hollywood snowflake powder! Red and green, it was such a big pile that she didn't know which one to use.</p>
<p>Her eldest brother was her sister-in-law's "cosmetics buyer." Yesterday, he estimated the price of these gifts for her. It was said that each bottle of perfume was at least 20 yuan or more, and the snowflake creams were also Western imports worth 5 or 6 yuan or more. However, when her eldest brother picked up the bottle that Lin had sent, he threw it on the table and said, "What is this thing? It's a Chinese product bought for a few coppers, and you're giving it as a gift." This made Lily blush for a while, especially when her sister-in-law deliberately picked up the bottle and smiled.</p>
<p>However, Lily remembered the note that Lin had attached, which read, "Don't underestimate this worthless thing. It is a domestic product, and it represents a sincere heart's offering."</p>
<p>In good conscience, Lily often found Lin to be cute. She always felt that Lin was better than others. When she heard her eldest brother's ridicule of the things that Lin sent, she couldn't help but protest:</p>
<p>"We want to be beautiful and protect our skin. Do we have to use foreign products? Foreign products are not better than Chinese products. It's just that foreign exchange is expensive, so foreign products are more expensive. At this time, we are still giving money to foreigners for nothing. What is the point?"</p>
<p>Her eldest brother said, "You have the guts not to use foreign products, don't be stubborn."</p>
<p>"Have the guts not to use foreign products"! Lily silently recited what her eldest brother had said yesterday. She thought that Chinese beauty products were just as good, so why should she be someone without guts and create a loophole for the country?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she unhesitatingly picked out the tube of domestic snowflake cream that Lin had sent and started to beautify her delicate and smooth face. After the beauty work was completed, she wrote a few similar notes and wrapped them in various cosmetics, and asked the driver, A Fu, to send them out. Those notes probably read, "Thank you very much for your gifts, but I dare not use foreign goods again, creating a double waste. Please forward them to others as appropriate."</p>
<p>When her sister-in-law saw her, she pulled her and said, "Sister Lily, you are dressed up especially beautifully for the New Year. After all, imported perfumes are not to be underestimated!"</p>
<p>Lily did not answer, but hid a secret smile in her belly. She thought, "Lin's domestic goods are not to be underestimated compared to imported beauty products!"</p>
<h3>A Collection of Beauty Methods</h3>
<p>— Di Si</p>
<p>1. Freckle Removal Method: Use 0.2 grams of potassium cyanide, 25 grams of salicylic acid, 4 grams of freckle wine, and 12 grams of glycerin. Place them all in a glass, stir with a stick until well mixed. Then fill with alcohol to 50-60 grams. This is a kind of freckle removal lotion. Apply it in the morning and before going to bed. Or drop it into a towel and apply it to the face. After one bottle is used up, miraculous effects can be seen.</p>
<p>2. Black Mole Removal Method: First place 30 grams of acetic acid in a bottle. Then mix in 3 grams of dilute sulfuric acid and about 1 gram of salicylic acid. This is ready. Dip a pen in this water and dot it on the moles every morning and evening. The moles will fall off in a few days.</p>
<p>3. Wrinkle Treatment Method: Wrinkles are a sign of aging, so wrinkles on young people are very unsightly. The treatment method is to use warm soap flake solution to wipe the face every night, then wash it clean with water. Do not use hot water to wash your face in the morning, because hot water can stretch the skin and increase wrinkles, so you should gradually switch to cold water, because cold water can increase the skin's resistance.</p>
<p>4. White Hair Prevention Method: Dissolve 3-4 grams of salt (about half a spoon) in a cup of strong black tea, and often wash your hair with it. This will not only prevent the growth of white hair, but also help hair growth.</p>
<p>5. Hair Loss Prevention Method: Pour 15 grams of camphor powder and 2 tablespoons of ginger wine into a bottle, then add a little water. Use cotton to dip and wipe it every day, and then brush it with a soft brush to help hair growth.</p>
<p>6. Baldness Treatment Method: Take one egg, take the yolk, then add half a spoon of cod liver oil and a few drops of onion juice, and stir it evenly. Then seal it in a bottle and wait for a month (the older the better) before opening it for use.</p>
<h3>The True Beauty and Goodness of Life</h3>
<p>— Physician Ding Hui Kang</p>
<p>Shen Bao's New Year edition has a special publication on beauty, and Lu Ziyiming asked me for a few words. I say, good! Beauty is what everyone desires. But there are many true beauties and goodnesses in life, not just beauty alone. However, the true beauties and goodnesses of life are closely related to beauty, but the world does not pay attention to them. I will especially point them out. Those who want to achieve the goal of beauty, and those who seek the true beauty and goodness of life, please pay attention.</p>
<p>(1) A Bright Home</p>
<p>A bright home is not necessarily a tall building, but one that seeks sufficient light, smooth air, bright windows and clean tables for reading, a few acres of green garden in front of the courtyard for planting flowers and bamboo, the sounds of birds and butterflies pleasing to the ears and eyes, and two or three paintings hanging on the wall as a substitute for travel. Wife and children laugh and play in it, with absolutely no sound of quarrels. The happiness of the family is complete, and the radiance of the owner is a natural result. This is one of the true beauties and goodnesses of life.</p>
<p>(2) A Healthy Life</p>
<p>The human body is like a machine, so life must have a certain rhythm. Work should adhere to the time, and not be uncontrolled, causing the body and mind to be too tired. This is the first step in a healthy life. Go to bed early and get up early, so that the body and mind can have sufficient rest. Appropriate exercise, such as sunbathing, deep breathing, walking, basketball, volleyball, swimming, etc., we must take out a little time every day to exercise the body. With a healthy life, natural beauty will naturally flow out. This is the second true beauty and goodness of life.</p>
<p>(3) Natural Enjoyment</p>
<p>Since we live in nature, the enjoyment of nature is our innate right, so why should we give it up ourselves. If we can travel once a week, climb mountains and approach water, choose scenic spots and seek out secluded places, looking at the clouds flying and understanding the illusion of the white clouds, watching the fish swimming and obtaining the pleasure of Hao Liang, the vulgar dust is exhausted, and the world is temporarily forgotten, then not only will our bodies benefit greatly, but also our souls will obtain supreme pleasure. This is an element of beauty and the third true beauty and goodness of life.</p>
<p>(4) A Detached Soul</p>
<p>The mundane world is nothing but suffering, let alone forgetting. There is not a trace of attachment in the heart, and every day the heart is full of harmony and vitality, and naturally all things revive. Su Zizhan said: The joys and sorrows of life pass by like dreams, and it is not worth pursuing. It is best to enjoy oneself from time to time. Bai Letian's poem says: What are you fighting for on the horns of snails? This body is placed in the light of flint, follow wealth and poverty and be happy, and not opening your mouth to laugh is a fool. Shi Tianji said: If a person's mind is always in harmony and joy, the color that appears on the outside will naturally be beautiful, and the inner peace in the heart will be so happy. Therefore, inner detachment has a beautiful appearance, which is the fourth true beauty and goodness of life.</p>
<p>(5) Appropriate Entertainment</p>
<p>Rest and play are important, as the ancients taught. In this modern and progressive society, mental stress is almost a common disease of modern people, and it is necessary to have appropriate entertainment to regulate it. This can be done according to each person's preferences. For example, painting the beauty of the heavens and earth, mountains and rivers, or capturing it in photography, not only pleases the mind, but also is enjoyed by the public. Or loosen your clothes in the wind and sing a song. Or play elegant music alternately and dance gracefully. All of these regulate the excessive tension of life and prevent the appearance from being affected by the excessive labor of life, which is the fifth true beauty and goodness of life.</p>
<p>(6) The Utilization of Science</p>
<p>In recent times, science has advanced, and those who seek the true beauty and goodness of life can also use science to obtain it. If anything destroys life, it is disease. Now, if someone suffers from a cough and their appearance is haggard, they can use science, such as X-ray diagnosis, pneumothorax for treating the lungs, so that the methods of prevention and early treatment can be obtained in time. This not only concerns the individual's health and beauty, but also benefits the family and society. Benefiting humanity is the highest goal of science, and it is also within the authority of science. Whether it is our desire for beauty or our desire for increased physical strength and early recovery of health, we can all use science. This is an element of creating the true beauty and goodness of life.</p>
<h3>"Applying the Pieces" in Peking Opera Makeup</h3>
<p>— Xue Hong Zhaizhu</p>
<p>If anyone has seen the appearance of Mei Wanhua or Cheng Yushuang, or their recent casual photos, and then goes to the theater to see one of their makeup performances, they will feel strange. Why did their plump appearance become so handsome once they were on stage? So-called ancient Chinese beauty face - a pointed face. Do they really have any secrets to change their "appearance"? No, the reason why they can make their fat faces thin should be attributed to "applying the pieces."</p>
<p>These "pieces" are attached to the head of the Dan roles. At first glance, they seem to be connected to the hair, but they are not. The "pieces" are several separate pieces. After the initial makeup work of the Dan roles - applying powder, rouge, drawing eyebrows, drawing eye sockets, etc. - these pieces on the forehead and temples are attached, and then further makeup work is carried out. If your face is fat, you can attach the pieces on both temples a little further back. In this way, under the reflection of strong light, the fat face becomes thin, and the thin face seems a little fatter. Also, for long faces, you can attach the forehead piece a little lower. For short faces, then move the forehead piece up a little. Unless your face is so fat or thin that it is out of shape, it can be made more beautiful, because this "applying the pieces" is a very important step in Peking Opera makeup, so I will briefly introduce it to you.</p>
<p>Recommendations for Cosmetics and Accessories</p>
<h3>Simple Beauty Techniques</h3>
<p>— Qiu Ping</p>
<p>Loving beauty is human nature, and there are many ways to achieve beauty. If you seek simple, easy-to-do, and truly beneficial methods, then it's all about maintaining the complexion to prevent premature aging, thus preserving youthfulness, and maintaining oral hygiene to prevent tooth loss, ensuring bright, clean teeth perfect for smiles and frowns. Both of these require daily attention to effectively preserve your looks and make you beautifully charming. Here, I will discuss how to maintain your complexion and how to practice oral hygiene, providing these tips for beauty-conscious ladies to consider.</p>
<p>The complexion, without protection from the weather, wind, rain, sun, and frost for extended periods, will naturally age easily. Physiologically speaking, the skin's inner layers are delicate and constantly undergoing metabolism. If the function of expelling the old and generating the new is weak, the old cannot be pushed out, and the new cannot be generated. Thus, the surface layer of the skin hardens, leading to wrinkles. This is a sign of aging and the appearance of "chicken skin" and "crane hair." Understanding this, the fundamental solution is to take care of the skin in time. The first condition is to choose a nourishing cream to apply to the face daily. This protects against the elements and absorbs secretions from pores, boosting biological activity, making new cells lively and healthy, and pushing out dead cells. In this way, the work of maintaining the complexion is complete. So, the truth is, it is very simple. However, with so many creams on the market, which one has the most nourishing ingredients? From my personal experience, I would recommend the well-known and popular Wudi Brand Butterfly Cream, which effectively softens the skin and removes blemishes. I have been using it for a long time, and it truly meets my ideal requirements for a beauty cream. Therefore, I dare to introduce it to the readers.</p>

<p>"A beautiful woman, her teeth are bright and white," we can see from this line of poetry that teeth are inseparable from beauty, and teeth greatly impact the health of the body. Now, valuing healthy beauty, if one wants to pursue health, the first step is to start with cleaning the mouth. According to the experience of many dentists, many people with dental problems come for treatment. Although they are cured with reasonable treatment, they have already suffered greatly. Even if cured, nothing is better than natural teeth. Investigating the cause of the disease, it is often due to a lack of proper oral hygiene. "In stagnant water, insects breed," if teeth are never clean, dental diseases arise. At the same time, yellow and greasy teeth repel others, which is a key obstacle to beauty and health. To correct this problem, one must immediately use the renowned Wudi Brand Wudi Toothpaste, also known as Calcium Crystal Toothpaste. I used to be accustomed to foreign toothpaste. After a friend introduced me to Wudi Toothpaste, I felt as though I had discovered it too late. Because Wudi Toothpaste has a different style and taste, you feel a different kind of pleasure when rinsing. Seeking among domestic products, there is truly nothing comparable. Even among foreign products, it is not much inferior. This is my personal experience, and I dare to publish it in the newspaper. I urge those who love using expensive foreign toothpaste to try Wudi Toothpaste. You will definitely prove that my sentiments are not exaggerated. At the same time, promoting domestic goods and reducing trade deficits year by year is also our inherent duty.</p>

<h3>Talking About Jadeite</h3>
<p>— Miaoren'er</p>
<p>Shanghai Jadeite Company is run by three giants in the jewelry industry: Lu Junren, Chen Huiquan, and Wu Ruisheng. Yesterday, while passing by Jing'an Temple Road, I took the opportunity to visit and had a long chat with Mr. Cheng Fusen. He told me about various aspects of jadeite, and I will briefly describe them below, according to my memory:</p>
<p>Jadeite is a type of jade that is produced in the deep mountains on the border of Yunnan in our country and British Burma. The most valuable is the transparent and bright green variety. It is hard and solid, impervious to knives, and does not melt in fire. There are many types, with varying degrees of quality, and only those experienced in this field can distinguish them. It has been circulating in our country for a long time but became popular during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. Since then, it has been fashionable, and royal nobles felt inadequate without it. Now, its jewelry dominates countries around the world, which can be attributed to the promotion of the Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>The polishing of jadeite relies entirely on manual labor, which cannot be achieved by machinery. Therefore, the techniques of the past centuries still reign supreme in the art world, and it is no coincidence that people both in China and abroad admire it. I recall last spring when the Da Xin Company held a jade art exhibition. Although the ticket price was as high as one yuan, visitors still flocked to it, and the venue could not accommodate them. I heard that the iron gate was pulled down several times a day, and Da Xin Company even made an exception to remain open on Sunday mornings as usual. Among the exhibits, there was a nine-lion round furnace, exquisitely carved and lifelike. Mr. Wu Tiecheng visited the exhibition and was amazed, saying that with this art, the national glory could be restored. His words were like that, enough to prove the preciousness, because the color and brilliance cannot be fully depicted by artists. Even modern color photography struggles to capture its likeness. Jadeite has its own precious light, dazzling and captivating, beyond human reach.</p>
<p>The preciousness of jadeite is as described above. Therefore, counterfeiting is rampant. Those commonly seen in the market include "burned materials," "fried colors," and "XX country jadeite." "Burned materials" use raw materials similar to glass, mixed with green color, and fired. However, they contain small bubbles, and the luster is by no means as bright and dazzling as genuine jadeite, making it easy to distinguish genuine from fake. "Fried colors" use white jadeite (commonly called "ground base") fried with emerald green material, hence the name. Because the materials are the same, it is more difficult to distinguish. However, when placed on fire and smoked, the color fades. As for "XX country jadeite," both its quality and color can deceive outsiders. However, it often has many black spots, and the color is yellowish. At first glance, it looks quite like jasper. When viewed under lamplight, the color is greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Jadeite businesses originally adhered to established practices, closing themselves off. In recent years, they have begun to seek external development. On one hand, they are rectifying industry regulations and striving for innovation, thus having the opportunity to come into contact with the outside world. Therefore, following the Da Xin Company jade art exhibition, there was a special handicrafts jewelry exhibition hall at the Municipal Government's Tenth Anniversary Exhibition. The exhibits were dazzling and unprecedented. Unfortunately, the July 7th Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, and the situation suddenly became tense. The exhibition was announced to be over before it could conclude, and the public missed out on seeing it, which is deeply regrettable.</p>
<p>Jadeite has participated in foreign competitions twice: once at the 1926 Panama Canal Philadelphia Expo and once at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair. Both times, it won awards and accolades, bringing honor to the country.</p>
<p>With the war shifting west, Shanghai's special circumstances have led to the abnormal development of various industries. The number of newly opened businesses in this industry can reach dozens. However, due to the lack of raw materials, prices have soared, yet buyers still flock to them, almost creating a situation of supply falling short of demand, truly the golden age of this industry.</p>
<h3>New Trends in the Manufacture of Cosmetics</h3>
<p>The creation of cosmetics by the Sino-French Pharmacy dates back to the sixteenth year of the Guangxu reign in the Qing Dynasty. At that time, there were very few domestic manufacturers using chemical methods to produce cosmetics, making them rare and valuable. For a time, the produced Liren Brand Hair Tonic, Violet Hair Oil, Luo Wei Fragrant Powder, and Sanmei Brand Cologne, and other products were popular throughout the country, earning great praise and being hailed as the leading company in the cosmetics industry. Some even mistakenly thought that the Sino-French Pharmacy specialized in selling cosmetics, and foreign merchants took notice, leading to several lawsuits. The reputation of the products became even more well-known. In 1925, the Da Xi Road Pharmaceutical Factory was established, making the equipment for manufacturing cosmetics even more perfect. Successive famous cosmetics that have been in circulation include Baby Face Cream, Double Lion Brand Cologne, White Rose Hair Oil, Fairy Fragrant Powder, etc., totaling more than sixty varieties. The selection of materials is rigorous, and the refining is exquisite, no less than imported products, and the prices are low and economical, especially praised by society. However, the pharmacy still feels that it is not enough and strives to improve. The goal of manufacturing cosmetics is not only for beauty but also to consider the function of treating diseases. The latest product, Vitamin E, exemplifies this principle. It has been shown to be effective in eliminating spots and moles. Future products will be manufactured following this new trend, and groundbreaking contributions will be made soon. I will make a preliminary announcement and list some of the cosmetics that have already been released: ——</p>
<p>Moisturizers: Baby Face, White Jade Essence, Sanmei Brand Cream, Blue Bottle Fragrant Cream, etc.</p>
<p>Hair Tonics: Star Hair Tonic, Liren Brand Hair Tonic, Swan Hair Tonic, etc. (eight types)</p>
<p>Hair Oils: Sanmei Brand Hair Oil, White Rose Hair Oil, Purple Orchid Hair Oil, etc. (five types)</p>

<h3>Cosmetics Industry and Ya Shuang in the Past Twenty-Five Years</h3>
<p>— Ye Jun</p>
<p>Humans have a fondness for beauty, just like their taste for food. Mencius said, "Eating and sex are human nature." In the past, there was a Taoist in the deep mountains whose son had never been close to women in his life. Once, he took him to the market, where he saw a beautiful woman, and his heart secretly yearned for her. When he returned, he was languid as if seriously ill. The father knew and tricked him, saying, "This is a man-eating tiger." The son said, "I would rather be eaten by her without complaint." Another day, he went to the market again and passed a ragged, plain woman with an unadorned face, then he suddenly realized and continued his father's path and finished his career. Therefore, beautiful and elegant appearances can make people admire, and ugly and unadorned appearances can make people disgusted, even children know this. China has had cosmetics since historical figures such as Bao Si, Da Ji, Xi Shi, Zhaojun, Pan An, and Song Yu. To this day, all beautiful people rely on the magic of makeup. The magic of makeup relies especially on the tools of makeup. Therefore, lead white and vermilion red, musk dense and orchid subtle, oily fat and cleansing soap (this soap is the fruit of a plant), are the cosmetics of thousands of years ago, which we can learn from between the lines when reading history. Today, with the development of science, the tools of makeup, in the past twenty-five years, due to the invention of Ya Shuang, have opened a new record of domestic beauty products, not only replacing foreign goods, but also becoming a guide for today's cosmetics industry. At that time, foreign XX creams and XX lotions were extremely popular. After Ya Shuang came out, they also paled in comparison, gradually appearing clumsy.</p>
<p>Ya Shuang is a chemical compound that is derived from fat, but without the greasiness of fat, and takes from soap, but without the harshness of soap. Added with honey and mixed with medicine, its unique fragrance has a unique effect. No identical substance can be found in the corner of East Asia, those who know can say it. Therefore, its effectiveness in cleansing the skin, whitening the skin, moisturizing the skin's cells, and nourishing the local tissues is not an empty word. Now try to express it with a chemical formula:</p>
<p>For a product to gain a foothold in society, it must have its own unique strengths. The strength of Ya Shuang lies not only in the good formula combination but also in the strict selection of materials. People generally think that fatty acids (ie, stearin) combined with alkalinity form a paste-like moisturizer. Little do they know that there are more than ten types of fatty acids, the most common being 127 to 129 degrees, then 129 to 131 degrees, and the best being 131 to 133 degrees. The fatty acids used in Ya Shuang have a strength of over 133 degrees, so the price is also doubled. The second is alkaline substances. Alkaline substances, such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, ammonia water, and ammonia compounds, can all have affinity with fatty acids and make snow creams. However, too much will cause harsh pain, and too little will cause oil separation. This combination must be carefully studied to make a perfect beauty product. Foreign honey can moisturize the skin, and boric acid can kill bacteria, all used in appropriate amounts in Ya Shuang products. Alcohol can stimulate the skin and cause local tissues to age over time, so Ya Shuang has tried its best not to use it. There is a way to distinguish this: if crystalline iridescent light is found in snow cream preparations, it is clear evidence that it contains a lot of alcohol.</p>
<p>Now is the 25th anniversary of Ya Shuang's release, and Shen Bao is soliciting articles for a special cosmetics issue from Mr. Chen. Mr. Chen modestly asked me to do it for him. I said that Ya Shuang's old friend is actually Shen Bao. In the early days of its release, Shen Bao's full-page advertisements gave great help to Ya Shuang's development. Now Shen Bao has been re-published for only a few months, and the number of advertisements and subscriptions are advancing in tandem. The future hope is to be comparable to the Times of London, which is what I look forward to.</p>
<h3>Scientific Makeup Art</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>In the past many years, cosmetics were dominated by foreign products across the country, and the prices were quite high. However, foreign cosmetics are only suitable for the skin of foreigners. It is important to know that the skin of Chinese people is clearly different from that of foreigners. Therefore, even if you use expensive cosmetics to make up, the result always feels unsatisfactory. However, every year millions of dollars were spent. In view of this, Mr. Sun Yucheng, a well-known figure in the medical community, made a special effort to conduct in-depth research, using his medical experience and experiments to invent a cosmetics that was sensational and surpassed foreign products, namely the world-renowned "Mirror Cream". This Mirror Cream uses the best snow cream raw materials as a base, and adds special effects medicines for removing freckles, acne, wrinkles, etc., all together, using scientific replication methods, to make a snow-like cream that is smooth, moist, white, tender, and delicate when applied to the face. And because of the action of the medicine, it can make the skin cells lively, and the stubborn melanin (ie, freckles) gradually fades away. It can indeed eliminate the shortcomings of the face unconsciously and invisibly. Therefore, since its invention, it has won twelve points of praise from all walks of life, and is regarded as the supreme product in cosmetics. Recently, I heard that a "Beauty Mirror Cream" has been invented, which is more delicate in quality and fragrant in taste than ordinary cosmetics, making it lovable. The medicine-containing name is called "Special Mirror Cream", which can treat the above-mentioned facial freckles, acne and other symptoms. It is truly the leading panacea. Those who want to get real super cosmetics, please pay attention to three points!</p>
<h3>Night Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Lai</p>
<p>Xian Meng Factory specializes in the production of high-end cosmetics, founded in 1931, with a capital of 50,000 national currency, completely operated by Chinese people, Chinese technicians, and most of the raw materials are French goods, and some are German and domestic. The products that have been produced include "Night Fragrance Perfume", "Gu Ben Cream", and "Xian Meng Mei Hair Acid". The products that are being planned include "Night Fragrance Cologne", "Night Fragrance Powder", lipstick, rouge, etc. The factory's products have always been exclusively managed by Shanghai Hua De Hang, and have always been sold to foreign countries. The total annual sales amount reaches more than 100,000 yuan. In recent years, it has also been seeking development in this city. Among them, "Night Fragrance Perfume" is especially popular with women from all walks of life in this city. The future is booming and is only a leader in domestic products.</p>

<h3>The Real Beauty Techniques of Film Star Clara Bow</h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, Clara Bow used to enchant countless young men and women on the silver screen. Although she now seems to have disappeared, her beauty techniques are still deeply imprinted in the minds of every film star.</p>
<p>Clara Bow concentrated all the modern woman's seductive powers and hypnotic qualities, strongly expressing her ardent and sincere passion as the common lover of men on the screen. Therefore, she succeeded in becoming a wonderfully beautiful flower in the film circle. Her fragrant and passionate charm deeply stimulated the hearts of men and even women. At that time, she was praised around the world as the "Hot Girl" and the "Empress of Modern Women".</p>
<p>However, when she first decided to become a film actress, her failure was extremely tragic. Although she was born in the city, grew up in the city, liked sports, swimming, riding, and playing tennis, her nature was very unrestrained and uninhibited. Therefore, although her age was still that of a blossoming girl, her face was old and loose, and the director finally had to say a few sarcastic words to her, causing her to sob, tears sparkling, which was captured in the lens. As a result, all the films she performed were cut. After this attempt at failure, it made her realize that she had really neglected beauty and the truly valuable youthful appearance of a girl. Therefore, in addition to exercise every day, she went out early in the morning, naked, facing the California sun; took a sunbath for more than half an hour, and before going to bed, she vigorously rubbed her face with juice soaked in apples and buckwheat in strong wine. In this way, her face gradually became plump, and the aging and loose skin soon showed a smooth and delicate luster. When she was invited to direct a play by Alma McAvoy for the second time, the result of the test screening was surprisingly satisfactory. Since then, she has been moving step by step in the film circle. In 1926, she starred in "Hot" written by American female writer Elina Glyn. Her beauty and enthusiastic name almost made her fly to the sky.</p>
<p>Now, more than half of the Hollywood stars are still faithfully using Clara Bow's beauty techniques to conceal their fleeting youth. Therefore, the term "Hot Girl" seems to have become a thing of the past, and what Hot Girl often said to fans at the time: "My beauty is not makeup, and my success is naturally not the director, but what I am grateful for is only the sun, apples, and wine." It has almost become the supreme truth of beauty.</p>
<h3>Four Beauty Methods</h3>
<p>— Lu Wenbiao</p>
<p>A beautiful face is often half natural, but artificial modifications can also help a lot. If the ancient beauties Xi Shi and Wang Zhaojun could be born today and use modern beauty techniques to make up, then I don’t know how much more beautiful they would be. The author will now introduce several basic beauty methods to beauty-loving ladies:</p>
<p>1. Hair Removal Method</p>
<p>The first step in beauty is to remove the hair on the face, because hair has a great hindrance to the appearance. Spread on the face, after the application, if the wax is not very hot at this time, you can use a blade to apply the wax to the face (one-tenth of a centimeter of the original). Then take a cold towel and cover it on the face to help the wax solidify. After a while, you can use a very quick operation to tear off the solidified wax skin, and the hair will be pulled off together without much pain.</p>
<p>There is another separate method to remove hair, which is to use electrology, but this work cannot be done at home and is much more expensive than using wax.</p>
<p>Many women use tweezers to pull out the hair one by one. This method is very bad, because it is time-consuming and harmful to the skin. The best method is to buy a special wax for hair removal at the pharmacy (you must buy a reliable brand, white wax is also acceptable). Put the wax in a clean small pot and simmer it over a low heat to make the wax gradually dissolve. When dissolving, use a blade to stir it until the wax is completely dissolved, then remove the pot from the fire and let the wax gradually cool down. Then take a piece of medical cotton, soak it in mica powder and apply it.</p>
<p>2. Facial Cleansing Method</p>
<p>If you want to make your face beautiful, relying solely on grease is not enough. The fundamental method is to nourish the skin and make it smooth and delicate. The most scientific method to nourish the skin is to take some yam flour, put it in a teacup, add two tablespoons of fragrant water, and mix it into a slurry. Then lie down on the bed and apply the yam flour slurry all over the face and neck. After application, wait quietly for half an hour to an hour, and then wash off the powder with boiling water. The face will be very radiant. If you feel that your skin is very dry and lacks fat, then you should use egg white instead of yam flour and apply it to the face. The method is exactly the same, and the effect is also very good. Hollywood stars in the United States love to use this beauty method.</p>
<p>3. Powdering Method</p>
<p>Before applying powder, you must first apply face cream, and then apply face powder. There are many types and colors of face powder. You must choose good ones to use, otherwise it will hurt the skin. When going to bed at night, you must wash off the grease completely. It is best to use medical cotton dipped in water to gently wipe the face, because sleeping with grease on is like sleeping in shoes, socks and outerwear, which is certainly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>4. Lip Tinting Method</p>
<p>The beauty of the lips has a great relationship with the appearance, so lip tinting is not just about applying a similar color to the lips. You must first study your own lips and determine the application method based on how they look. For example, if the corners of the lips are sinking downwards, you should apply some color upwards, but never apply the color to the corners of the lips. If the lips are larger, you only need to add a little color between the two lips. There are many colors used for lip tinting, including dark red, light red, coral color, etc. Dark red looks like blood and is only suitable for naturally beautiful lips. Ordinary people should use light red or coral color, which is more appropriate. If you are attending an evening banquet, because of the lighting, the color applied to the lips will not be obvious. Apply another layer of Indian gum on the color to make it more bright and radiant.</p>
<p>5. Eye Beauty Method</p>
<p>The beauty of the eyes lies in the agility and vitality of the eyeballs. To achieve this goal, you only need to get up every morning and rotate your eyeballs up, down, left, and right in a relatively open area. At the same time, gently tap your forehead with both index fingers to activate the blood. Practicing this for a few minutes will greatly help the beauty of the eyes.</p>
<h3>Concerning Perfume</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Many girls will probably receive one or two bottles of perfume from their boyfriends or husbands during Christmas or New Year's! But did you know that this perfume manufacturing industry, in the United States alone last year, had a total trade value exceeding 200 million US dollars? Beauty salons in America, numbering 50,000, earned more than 100 million dollars! In Grasse, the world-renowned center of the French perfume industry, 7,500 tons of fresh flowers are supplied annually.</p>
<p>A woman who is already beautiful will naturally become even more charming with a few drops of perfume essence. Next, let me talk about everything about perfume.</p>
<p>Twelve years ago, a group of scientists discovered countless beautiful, engraved calcite bottles in the tomb of King Tutankhamun in the Nile River valley of Egypt. Once the bottle caps were opened, a strange fragrance immediately rushed out from the bottles. Egypt was originally a nation that could not be conceded, and it is she who has given us perfume today.</p>
<p>Although there are no records of perfume and cosmetics in human history, we are certain that their stories, like those of humans, are ancient. From the oldest cultures of China, Egypt, Babylon, Greece, Rome, etc., it seems that making perfume was also a refined art.</p>
<p>Fifty years before the birth of Jesus, there was a queen named Cleopatra in Egypt. It would be impossible to fully record the materials she used for perfume and makeup throughout her life. It is said that at a grand banquet she held for Antony, she covered the floor of the palace with a two-foot-thick carpet of roses. Her eulogy after death read: "Let your nostrils always have fragrance, oh, noble queen! Let lotus flowers always be in your throat."</p>
<p>In the past, Chinese women used "wood shaving water" to brighten their hair, and it is rumored that they also put some fragrant powder inside their "lotus shoes." Centuries ago, Chinese women already had colorful paintings on their fingers.</p>
<p>During banquets in the ancient Roman Empire, spices were also added to the wine. Queen Elizabeth even had a special room dedicated to making perfume for her personal use!</p>
<p>But from ancient times to the present, there have been countless people who opposed this cosmetic. During the heyday of Florence, a monk named Savonarola once said to many women, "Sisters of Florence—sin, laziness, vanity—I will call you to destroy all the spices of the East."</p>
<p>At that time, one woman immediately stood up and ran into the street; the others followed, and soon the center of the street was piled high with powders, perfumes, and other cosmetic items. People in other cities were also infected by this madness, and a fire was set to burn a large number of beauty items; strangely, this fire burned for several days before it was extinguished.</p>
<p>Later, things changed, and that monk was eventually burned to death for his unrestrained words.</p>
<p>During the Victorian era, there were also people who opposed the use of powder and lipstick. Later, during the Crusades, many nobles and knights brought countless precious perfumes from the East to Europe; this laid the foundation for subsequent East-West trade and further influenced the Renaissance and Columbus's discovery of the New World in 1492.</p>
<p>Queen Catherine of France during the reign of Henry II was also a woman who loved perfume. She had a person named Chanat who was specially dedicated to making perfume for her.</p>
<p>Chanat was able to make perfume into a kind of poison, so that anyone who put on gloves sprinkled with this poison would die silently—this secret recipe was not passed down.</p>
<p>This queen also mixed all the spring water in Paris with perfume. Grasse, the center of the French perfume industry, is said to have been founded by her as well.</p>
<p>There, you will see countless roses, violets, and orange trees planted. Grasse supplies the world with 7,500 tons of fresh flowers every year to make perfume for women to spray!</p>
<p>The fragrance extracted from the flowers still needs to be combined with other fragrances. Good and bad scents blend together to produce the fragrance and richness of perfume. A popular perfume is said to be a mixture of seventeen different scents. Among them, musk is the most precious. Finally, the perfume must be diluted with alcohol; if it is too strong, it will be pungent; if it is too weak, its fragrance will not last.</p>
<p>In the past, we only had two hundred kinds of fragrances, but now there are at least a thousand. Many of them are made by combining various ingredients.</p>
<p>Perfume is no longer a luxury in modern times. The manufacture of leather, insecticide powder, oilcloth, paint, various fabrics, ink, and medicine relies on it to remove unpleasant odors. Now, some scientists have even created a fragrant gasoline, which is used to spray into the air to remove the turbidity within!</p>
<p>From this, we should know the importance of perfume!</p>

<h3>Talking about Cosmetics</h3>
<p>— Hen Shi</p>
<p>Aesthetic concepts are based on human nature, especially among women. Even if someone is as ugly as Wu Yan, if praised, they will be sincerely happy, considering it the greatest fortune. However, if criticized, they will invariably bristle with anger, harboring resentment to the bone. Therefore, all humans love beauty. However, the word "beauty" has no fixed definition. What constitutes beauty must depend on individual goals, and the fashions of different eras also vary. Therefore, beauty of the face is difficult to define definitively. In past eras, artificial beautification techniques were very primitive and lacked medical knowledge. Cosmetics were limited to face powder, but face powder was rich in lead, which not only did not benefit the skin, but also, after prolonged absorption by the pores, caused changes in the fine cell structure of the skin, and the metabolic function gradually declined. Once the face powder was washed off, the skin's pigmentation became dull and lifeless. Therefore, artificial beautification techniques in the past not only failed to exert their beautifying effects but also hindered health. Since the enlightenment of science, the advancement of medicine, all beautification methods have been changing with each passing day. Regardless of gender, if there are defects or obstacles on the face that cannot be treated medically, artistic methods can be used to solve them. Taking vanishing cream as an example of cosmetics, its application procedures and contained ingredients are vastly superior to the face powder of past eras. The composition of vanishing cream mostly consists of a type of face powder and various aromatic substances mixed together. Its main raw materials are stearic acid, paraffin wax, olive oil, glycerin, and preservatives such as hydrogen peroxide and boric acid, which allow it to be stored for a long time without changing. The various other aromatic agents vary depending on the manufacturer or the needs of the times. Among the cosmetics on the market, the most expensive fragrance used, as far as the reporter knows, is Yashuang, produced by the Continental Pharmacy. Its main fragrance costs more than 240 yuan per pound in national currency, and it has an exclusive contract, enjoyed solely by that company, preventing others from ordering it. Therefore, for twenty years, it has held a unique position in the cosmetics industry.</p>
<p>The first vanishing cream to be launched on the Chinese market was Hazeline Snow. At that time, transportation was inconvenient, and newspaper advertisements were rarely used to promote it. Only commercial ports could see this silvery-white beauty product. Inner chambers in the mainland had virtually none. Later, Baiyushuang rose to prominence, sparing no effort in its promotion, becoming popular almost nationwide, while the domestic cosmetic Yashuang took the opportunity to rise up and contend with foreign goods. Yashuang's quality and fragrance are indeed among the best of domestic products, but its fragrance, after prolonged storage, changes color, which is its only flaw. Its medical efficacy can prevent wrinkles and remove all spots because dust flies in the air and, if it sticks between the skin tissues, combines with the fat and sweat secreted under the skin, it turns black, or from strong sunlight. Sunburn or frostbite, if treated with Yashuang, can all be protected. To use it, first apply Yashuang to the fingertips, use two thumbs, place it on the cheekbones, then use two index fingers, lightly rubbing the eyelids of both eyes. Repeat this several times, and you can also rub the face or arms in the same way, so that the muscles in each part are highly developed, which can prevent wrinkles; but you must persevere for a long time to be effective. Muscular fibers in anatomical science, unless rubbed, cannot promote metabolism, and unless you use Yashuang, you cannot stimulate the absorption power of pores. As for sunburn or frostbite, apply Yashuang before each face wash, then cover with a hot towel for about three minutes, and then wash off the Yashuang with warm water. After washing your face, apply it again, and you will surely be able to restore your original condition.</p>
<p>Yashuang's medical efficacy is as described above, so its sales have increased year by year, from south to north, and it is highly trusted by society. Yashuang has contributed to the disappearance of the belief in the ability of foreign goods.</p>
<p>Simultaneously launched with Continental Yashuang was Xuehua from Guang Sheng Hang. Its quality and fragrance are also of the highest quality, but its volume is smaller, and it is popular in the southern region. It is not as prevalent in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. In recent years, it has been the era of the rise of vanishing creams. Products such as Die Shuang from the Home Industry Cooperative, Ai de Shuang from the Oriental Industry Cooperative, Wuzhou Beauty Cream, Continental Beauty Cream, Zhongfa Haier Mian, and Baichang Mian You can be seen everywhere in newspapers. Among them, both good and bad can be seen, and each has its own strengths. New products this year are emerging like bamboo shoots after rain, such as Yonghe's Rongyou, Tongren's Mianli, Taiping's Tongzhi Cream, Baijia's Doukou, and Meihua's Zhuguang Cream. There are countless others that have not been seen in newspapers and are sold on consignment to various foreign goods stores. This is because manufacturing is simple, requires no large capital, and bottles of materials can be purchased everywhere, but whether the combination meets medical principles can only be known after testing.</p>
<h3>The Past and Present of Mianli</h3>
<p>— Pharmacist Zhu Qiuyuan</p>
<p>The wheel of time is rapidly advancing, and all material enjoyment is naturally changing with the times. Let's talk about cosmetics. In the past, people only knew how to apply rouge and powder, seeking temporary whiteness and temporary beauty. However, no one paid attention to whether this powder could improve beauty after use. From this perspective, rouge and powder are ultimately decorative items, which offer no benefit to the skin. It's simply like painting a wall, resulting in a rough, white, and gray face that cannot be without it for a single day. This is the evil of inferior rouge and powder. However, in today's age of scientific development, the medical community has also felt the great shortcomings in the extensive use of beauty products and is beginning to improve them. "Mianli" is a newly emerging scientific beauty product in recent years and is also a cosmetic with medical properties. We know that women cannot avoid applying powder, and we also know what women deeply hate and resent: blemishes, acne, and other disfiguring conditions. Therefore, based on these two points, "Mianli" improved vanishing powder, using purely medical principles to formulate it. "Mianli" not only nourishes the skin, preserving the beauty of youth, but also eliminates the biggest obstacles to beauty: blemishes and acne. Vanishing powder is a compound of stearic acid and alkali, with some glycerin inside. Its ability is limited to moisturizing at most, to be used as a powder base. After applying it, you still have to apply dry powder. Using it is very troublesome and also very uneconomical. "Mianli" combines this fragrant powder and vanishing cream into one, considering the chemical aspects several times before adding various medicinal powders for beautifying and removing blemishes inside. When applied to the face, it has the wonderful effect of lightly applying powder with a graceful appearance. However, one thing needs to be clarified: the powder contained in "Mianli" is absolutely not a type of lead-based fragrant powder but is a medicinal powder that is absolutely beneficial to the skin. Therefore, the results have been very satisfactory. In these fleeting four or five years, we have continuously received hundreds of thank-you letters from ladies from all walks of life after curing blemishes and acne. We deeply feel that this glorious harvest makes our painstaking research worthwhile. At the same time, it has uniquely opened a new chapter in cosmetics, occupying a position of its own. "Mianli" has been issued a drug permit No. 128 by the Central Health Administration. It seems that no cosmetic has yet obtained such a certificate. "Mianli" previously had three types of fragrances: A, B, and C. Recently, we have specially created fragrance D. This is a very valuable type of fragrance, indeed more fragrant than others, quiet and lovely. We firmly believe that it will definitely win the universal sympathy of ladies from all walks of life. Done, I wish everyone a Happy New Year.</p>
<h3>The Responsibility of Beauty Products</h3>
<p>— Ling Naiping</p>
<p>The love of beauty is inherent in human nature. According to historical records, Zhang Chang had the joy of painting eyebrows, and He Yan excelled at applying powder. Just like the jade-like beauties of the North and the flowery beauties of the South, the origins of beauty products have been respected in our country since ancient times. It is a pity that the material enjoyment of that time cannot be compared with the enjoyment of the current scientific era. At this time, when beauty products permeate the times and flood the market, with countless shapes and colors, beauty-loving ladies must pay attention to the selection of beauty products as good companions for their dressing tables and fine products for modification. The manufacturers of beauty products must not forget the responsibility they should bear when manufacturing beauty products. Do not specialize in using the novel publicity methods that resonate all day long, and use inferior products to deceive the world for profit. You must focus on formulation and efficacy to not betray the responsibility of manufacturing beauty products. In this way, beauty lovers have something to love, things are put to practical use, and producers are welcomed, complementing each other.</p>
<p>People are born with different shapes and postures. Some are delicate and beautiful, and some have a healthy and beautiful appearance. To maintain their beautiful faces forever and not age due to the invasion of climate, dust, and years, or even to transform ugliness into beauty and change roughness and darkness into fairness, the application of era-specific beauty products is essential for success, so as to enhance beauty and preserve youth forever. As far as the author knows, Fubeikang Cosmetics Unlimited Company has a long history and has always been a representative of the production of era beauty products with forward-thinking and scientific approaches. Its most famous and precious product—"Haoyou," a special effect whitening and blemish-removing agent—can indeed transform old tissues in the skin and eliminate all obstacles to beauty. It has long been loved by tens of millions of ladies. The company's other famous products, such as Baique Xiangfen, Baique Rouge, Fubeikang Flower Dew Perfume, Fubeikang Hair Cream, Hair Gel, Tianxin Perfume, etc., number no less than dozens of types, all exquisitely beautiful and popular everywhere, truly a long-established Angel of Beauty, extraordinary.</p>
<p>"Shenbao Beauty Edition" is a special publication for studying and solving beauty problems. I hope that all beauty-loving ladies in the world will have the beauty of Pan An and the loveliness of Xi Shi.</p>
<h3>Ai De Shuang</h3>
<p>— Ai</p>
<p>Ai De Shuang, produced by Oriental Chemical Industry Cooperative, is made according to beauty principles and using scientific methods, in three grades: first, second, and third. It has the functions of cleaning the skin and nourishing cells, with the richest beauty effects. Therefore, since its sale, it has been welcomed by beauty-loving ladies.</p>
<h3>Tongzhi Cream</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>People who have freckles on their faces are often troubled by the lack of products to cure them. Although there are many methods for treating freckles on the market, they are all promotional in nature. It is now heard that Tongzhi Cream and Yangmian Ye, two kinds of beauty products produced by the Taiping Pharmacy on Weihaiwei Road, are specialized in treating freckles, rosacea, oily skin, etc., and have a proven effect, with sales reaching more than twenty years. They can be called wonderful products.</p>

<h3>Zhong Lingxiu Talks About the Nationwide Implementation of Remedial Education for Out-of-School People, Achieving Results Twice as Good as the Total of the Previous Eight Years; The Lack of Teachers Should be Addressed by Quickly Establishing Teacher Training Institutions; It is Hoped that Everyone Will Work Together to Promote Remedial Education for the War of Resistance and National Construction</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) Zhong Lingxiu, the section chief in charge of people's education at the Social Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education, recently discussed the main points of the Ministry of Education's handling of remedial education for out-of-school people and improvements in great detail, as follows:</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Education promulgated the Outline of Measures for People's Schools in the 17th year of the Republic of China, up to the 24th year, the total number of people who have received education in people's schools in various provinces and cities during these eight years is only over 8 million, averaging about 1 million people per year. Since the promulgation and implementation of the Outline of Measures for Remedial Education for Out-of-School People in the 25th year, aiming to eliminate illiteracy nationwide within six years, it was planned that 12 million people would receive education in the 25th year. However, the plans set by various provinces and cities have exceeded this number. The results of one year of effort in the 25th year have surpassed twice the total number of the previous eight years, with significant results. What is the reason for this? Tracing back to the source, it is due to the government's planned and targeted strict supervision, and the use of political power to implement a mandatory system is also an important key to achieving great results. However, since the implementation in various provinces and cities, there are still many difficulties. To summarize, there are approximately: 1. Difficulty in raising funds; 2. Lack of talent. The education funds of various provinces and cities are not very sufficient to begin with. Free education is being promoted, and people's education must also be planned and considered. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to raise additional funds. The Ministry of Education has provided substantial subsidies for free education funds, so requesting subsidies for people's education funds is also a matter of course. However, the central people's education funds are actually limited, which leads to requests from various provinces and cities that often amount to tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands. Although the Ministry of Education provides slight subsidies, the amount is ultimately limited. Dissatisfaction with the failure to obtain funds inevitably affects the progress of the work. However, various provinces and cities must pay special attention to the fact that the funds for out-of-school people should be based on local fundraising as a principle. In municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan, the municipal government should coordinate the funds. In various provinces, regions, counties, and cities, the provincial and county governments should share the costs as a principle. On the central level, the Ministry of Education should consider the situation and provide separate subsidies, but various provinces and cities cannot completely or largely rely on the central government's subsidies without devising ways to raise funds themselves. Therefore, how to plan the sources of funds and stipulate the steps for gradual annual increases to meet urgent needs should be regarded as an important issue of the present by various provinces and cities, and effective solutions should be devised. It is found that since the large-scale implementation of remedial education for out-of-school people began in the 15th year, the required number of teachers could barely be met. However, since more than 40,000 teachers must be added annually thereafter, there will inevitably be a shortage of teachers. The difficulties are even greater in remote provinces. As a remedy, it is urgently necessary to establish teacher training institutions for people's schools extensively. Each administrative supervisory district should establish at least one institution for rapid training to avoid a shortage of teachers. In addition, there are two things that are closely related to remedial education for out-of-school people and can be mutually linked to handle: 1. Social military training (or militia training, people's training); 2. All levels of schools, agencies, and organizations should uniformly set up affiliated people's schools. According to the provisions of Article 2 of the Outline of Measures for Remedial Education for Out-of-School People, attention must be paid to self-defense training in addition to civic education and literacy education. Self-defense training is currently being actively carried out in all provinces across the country, with strict organization and rigorous discipline. In addition to military training, literacy education and civic education are also taught. The time is very economical, and teaching is easy to implement. There is no difficulty in retaining students, which is really convenient with half the effort and twice the result. It is hoped that the education authorities of various provinces will pay close attention to this. As for the measures for schools at all levels to concurrently handle social education, the Ministry of Education has already promulgated and implemented them. Remedial education for out-of-school people is the most essential education in the process of the War of Resistance and National Construction. School education should be socialized and should be quickly carried out concurrently in order to be universal. It is found that there are a total of 30,000 large, medium, and small schools across the country. Each school should concurrently run at least two classes, with 50 people in each class, and hold two sessions per year. Each school can teach at least 200 people per year. The total number of people who can receive education annually in schools at all levels across the country is 6 million. If the wartime people's school measures are followed, with each session lasting two months, each school can hold four additional sessions per year, and the number of people receiving education can be increased by another 6 million, totaling 12 million per year. Various agencies and organizations can also be set up in the same way, and the number of people receiving education can be increased by at least 2 million to 4 million annually. Combining items 1 and 2, the number of people receiving education can be increased by at least 8 million to 16 million annually. The effort required by schools at all levels, agencies, and organizations is minimal, but the benefits for the people are substantial. It is especially hoped that all aspects of society will work together and provide assistance to vigorously promote this. Now, at this critical moment of national crisis, this people's remedial education is an essential plan for the War of Resistance and National Construction. It is hoped that the education authorities of various provinces and cities will pay special attention to this, provide ample funds, train teachers, and work together with military training agencies. Schools at all levels, agencies, and organizations should uniformly set up affiliated schools and promote them annually to complete the great task of eradicating illiteracy nationwide and raising the cultural level of society within six years. It is also hoped that compatriots across the country will attach importance to this, directly and indirectly provide assistance, and promote its success.</p>
<h3>Senior Educationist Shen Jiyi Passes Away</h3>
<p>Educator Shen Jiyi was one of the founders of private school reform. In the late years of the Qing Dynasty, during the Guangxu period, schools were not yet widespread. Mr. Shen, in view of the urgent need to improve the private school system, resolutely changed private schools to the school system. During the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Shen founded the National Education Advancement Association and established Anding Primary School, with the aim of improving normal school talent. Primary school education is the foundation of national education. Mr. Shen traveled extensively to various provinces across the country to investigate the achievements of education in various places and the state of normal schools. He devoted his life to education for nearly forty years. In his later years, his energy gradually declined, but he still worked with Mr. Zhu Tingqi and others to establish rural primary schools in more than 30 townships in Pudong, and received the support of local gentry and merchants, with remarkable achievements. Although Mr. Shen was in his seventies, he still walked in the countryside, inspecting the conditions of various schools and lecturing on the meaning of the New Life Movement. His enthusiasm for education was like this. Recently, due to worrying about national affairs, he contracted heart failure and passed away on December 29th, at the age of seventy-one. The funeral was held yesterday at the Shanghai Funeral Home. The education community has lost a mentor, and everyone who heard the news mourned him.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Women's University Holds Anniversary Commemoration</h3>
<p>Shanghai Women's University Women's Middle School and Women's Primary School on Xin Dagu Road in this city jointly held the 18th, 8th, and 6th anniversary commemorations yesterday. The ceremony was held in the morning, chaired by Chairman Lin Kanghou, who reported on the purpose of the meeting. Subsequently, school directors Qian Jianqiu, Lu Xirong, Huang Jingwan, guest Tang Guoli, Chen Jicheng, teacher representative Zhao Yi, etc., gave speeches. Student representatives from the large, medium, and small departments and student representatives from the street children's class sponsored by the school's student union delivered congratulatory speeches and presented gifts. Finally, Principal Dr. Wu Zhi delivered a speech and dismissed the meeting. In the afternoon, there was a performance of recreational activities.</p>
<p>Overview of Education</p>
<h3>Difficult Children's School</h3>
<p>After the sacred "August 13th" War of Resistance broke out, many boy and girl scouts in Shanghai went crazy to defend their motherland. Whether on the battlefield or in the rear, they presented their strength. This is the responsibility of every citizen, so they all embraced the determination to sacrifice for the motherland. Therefore, during the Songhu War of Resistance, they had many touching stories, which are of course still deeply imprinted in the minds of people in society.</p>
<p>Since the westward movement of the national army, these vast numbers of young scouts have either joined the army to gallop on the battlefield, or been displaced and lost on this desolate isolated island because their hometowns were ravaged by the brutal enemy. Therefore, the Shanghai Boy Scout Council established the Difficult Children's School to provide them with sustenance and education, and to cultivate talents for the motherland. At the same time, it has received economic assistance from the Joint Disaster Relief Association of Charity Organizations in this city and the Refugee Relief Branch, so many displaced boy and girl scouts have continued to obtain educational opportunities.</p>
<p>The school has been established for almost a year. The principal is Zhao Weizu. Due to the school building, classes were held at the Taiping Bank on Tianjin Road last semester, and temporarily moved to the Zhirenyong Girls' School during the summer vacation. This semester, it has been relocated to Xu Garden on Connaught Road. Xu Garden was originally a famous private garden in Shanghai, but now it is a desolate place. They built a large reed shed in the ruins to serve as a place for teaching and raising them, and hundreds of orphans are buried in it to study hard. Under such circumstances, the school's teaching is, of course, extremely strict. The teachers of this semester include more than a dozen people such as Sun Yixin, Xia Huanxin, Xu Zhengyi, Xu Xi, Yang Lucun, and Xiao Zijie, all of whom are well-known figures in the education circles of this city. They are all willing to give spiritual help in a purely voluntary manner. The same is true for the staff.</p>
<p>The school originally had a high school department last semester. This semester, due to financial difficulties, there are only three junior high school grades, with a total of hundreds of students. There are also nearly ten girls. Their daily life is under strict scout management. They all wear national product blue cloth work clothes, with classes in the morning and skills in the afternoon. They take turns camping once a week. Extracurricular activities include organizations such as a singing team, Peking opera, drama, and calligraphy research society. Recently, in order to consider the students' future, the school plans to move towards vocational education, teaching students production skills. It has now established an advertising agency and plans to equip a printing department and other small workshops. It is currently being planned by experts, but the economic aspect is of course difficult. It is heard that social charities are hoped to provide assistance.</p>
<p>This semester, the school has deeply felt the joy and encouragement given to them by people in society with their sympathy and assistance. They are determined to work hard in the midst of economic hardship.</p>

<h3>Lincoln Cup Cross-Country Race: Lidu Wins Team Championship, Clemens Wins Individual First Place, Wang Zhenglin Second Place 30 Yards Behind</h3>
<p>The Lincoln Cup six-mile Sino-Western cross-country race, sponsored by US Tongxing, was held at 9:00 AM yesterday in front of the Minli Middle School on Difeng Road. More than 20 people deserted before the battle. The actual number of participants was 102, and the total number of finishers was 16. As a result, Lidu Jia Lai was evenly matched with 15 points and won the team championship. Dongsele was second with 29 points. The individual first place was Dongsele Clemens, who defeated veteran Wang Zhenglin with a score of 31 minutes and 10 seconds. Wang Zhenglin was about 30 meters behind and won the runner-up with 31 minutes and 21 seconds. The third place was Guan Youwen with 31 minutes and 58 seconds. Mrs. Zhu Baohong presented the awards on the spot. The top six teams each received a silver cup, and the top ten individuals also received awards. Each finisher received a medal. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Competition Along the Way</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM, Zhang Yuansheng ordered the mobilization of thousands of horses. At Yidingpan Road, Clemens of Dongsele, No. 7, took advantage of his long legs and stood out from the crowd, leading the way. Five meters later, French Army Xie Qierji, Lidu Jia Zhang Liang, and Ling Xuewen followed closely behind. Wang Zhenglin, Guan Youwen, and Cao Shizhang were sworn brothers and strode forward. On Daxi Road, Guan Youwen rose to third place, and Wang Zhenglin followed closely behind. At Columbia Road, French Army Xie Qierji retreated again, and Zhenglin strode up and jumped to second place. However, Clemens still took the lead all the way to Dunxin Road. Lidu Zhang Liang and Ling Xuewen rose up and tied for third place, followed by Guan Youwen, Dongsele's Er Maojiang, and Indian Gao Sheng. The French Army Xie Qierji, Chen of Hongkou, Zixiang, and Zhou Ruquan competed fiercely. The rest went up and down, unpredictable. When Kaixuan Road turned into Yuyuan Road, Wang Zhenglin once rose up, originally planning to come from behind, but Clemens was tall and strong, and had enough stamina. He led the way all the way and rushed to the finish line to win first place. Zhenglin was about 30 yards behind and won second place.</p>
<p>Team Total Score</p>
<p>Lidu A 15 points, Dongsele 29 points, Hongkou Team 39 points, French Army 59 points, Youlian Team 88 points, Lidu B 97 points, Sangao Team 112 points, Youqiang Team 121 points, Xusheng Team 135 points.</p>

<h3>Man-Wolf Fierce Battle</h3>
<p>— Hercules</p>
<p>According to various sources: The entire world has been hit by a cold wave in the past few days. Whether in America, Europe, or the Far East, it is extremely cold. In Shanghai, due to the invasion of the Siberian high pressure, the north wind is biting and extremely cold.</p>
<p>Modern people, who have already lost the ability to resist the forces of nature, how can they withstand the sudden attack and invasion of the severe cold? Therefore, in winter, many poor people are frozen to death. This year is of course no exception. It has been heard in the United States, and there must be more in China. However, in Romania, a more tragic "man-wolf fierce battle" occurred:</p>
<p>"Due to the severe cold weather, mountain wolves had nowhere to eat, and yesterday they invaded the village of Brusturi in groups. The villagers each held knives, axes, hoes, and shovels, and fought fiercely with them for two hours. As a result, four villagers and fourteen wolves died." (Reuters, Rome, December 29)</p>
<p>Wolves are the most cruel animals. Their personality is greedy, fierce, and evil, and their behavior is cunning and dangerous. They not only devour small animals such as rabbits, deer, and birds, but also harm humans. However, they cannot jump out of the control circle of nature. The wolves in the mountainous area of Brusturi Village had to leave the place where they had "nowhere to eat" in order to survive, and broke into the village in an attempt to save their hunger. But they also knew the danger of this action, so they formed "groups." This may be said to be their "intelligence," but after all, they cannot defeat human wisdom. The people of Brusturi Village knew to use "unity" to deal with the "groups" of wolves, and to use "knives, axes, hoes, and shovels" to deal with the "poisonous teeth and sharp claws." Finally, they overcame the current difficulties and shattered the wolves' attempts.</p>
<p>This scene of "man-wolf fierce battle" lasted for as long as two hours. We can imagine the tension and fierceness of the struggle at that time. At the same time, based on the number of deaths of humans and wolves, we can also know the large number of people and wolves who participated in the fierce battle. Although the people of Brusturi Village did not win a complete victory in this fierce battle and also suffered considerable sacrifices, the price of this sacrifice was great. It not only defeated the invasion of man-eating wolves, but also showed that only the spirit of sacrifice as if facing death can protect the safety of the village and avoid the ravages of greedy wolves. In other words: If the people of Brusturi Village do not know how to endure pain and sacrifice when disaster is imminent, and only seek to close their doors for safety, then they will not be able to escape the devouring of greedy wolves, and its result will exceed the degree of pain at this time.</p>
<p>The value of this piece of gossip news may not be high in itself, but it can be used as a help from other mountains when Chinese compatriots who are struggling hard read it.</p>
<h3>National Calendar New Year in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— New Dream</p>
<p>The New Year always has some New Year atmosphere, but although the National Calendar has been promulgated for many years, the atmosphere of the National Calendar New Year cannot match the Lunar New Year. It only gives the leisure class and the people who enjoy happiness one more opportunity to revel. There are two New Years in a year. The National Calendar New Year has not been long past, and there is also a Lunar New Year. I wonder when this custom will be broken?</p>
<p>Just talking about Shanghai, on the National Calendar New Year's Day, except for a few prosperous roads, some shops have their iron doors closed, with notes saying "New Year's Day Holiday for One Day" or "Three Days," and the blue sky and white sun flag is pulled to the top of the flagpole, fluttering in the wind. Everything else is the same as usual. If you meet a person with a lower level of knowledge or an ordinary worker and ask him what day it is today, he will definitely answer you without hesitation: "It is the foreign New Year's Day—" This New Year's Day is foreign and has nothing to do with the Chinese. Regarding this, we can see the difficulty of abolishing customs.</p>
<p>However, after eating lunch, if you walk on the street on New Year's Day, you can immediately see that movie theaters and Peking opera houses are doing particularly well. The "Full" sign is hung on the door, and the iron door is also closed tightly. Not being able to see a play with money will make you a little annoyed. But if you watch a movie, it doesn't matter. Buy a ticket for the next show and wait patiently at the iron gate. Although you will fully experience the taste of the northwest wind, you will definitely see it. Every amusement park is also full. Needless to say, the dance halls are lively at night. Isn't this full of the New Year's atmosphere? But it is only limited to the leisure class and the people who enjoy happiness. Isn't the labor sector still the same as usual, running around and working? The children are not like Lunar New Year's Day, putting on new clothes, and the mothers and sisters are also wearing everyday clothes. New clothes are reserved for showing off during the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>What makes you feel particularly funny on the street is the people selling calendars and almanacs: "Want an old French new calendar book? Buy one for six coppers." Since it is a new calendar book, why add the words "old French"? It is contradictory and makes you laugh. Wasn't it forbidden to print the lunar calendar on the calendar a few years ago? However, now, which of the colorful calendars is not a combination of the lunar and solar calendars? Otherwise, there would be no customers. The facts tell us that the complete abolition of the lunar calendar will take a considerable amount of time.</p>
<p>However, to be fair, in our memory, since the establishment of the National Government, repeated orders have been issued, ordering the people to follow the National Calendar uniformly. There was a year when, under the strict orders of the Shanghai Municipal Government, all shops, large and small, in Nanshi and Zhabei were closed for three days starting from the National Calendar New Year's Day, and drums were beaten loudly, and spring couplets were pasted on the shop doors, and many firecrackers were set off. In the same year, all schools in Shanghai had classes as usual during the Lunar New Year. The Education Bureau sent people to investigate. If anyone was found to have taken a holiday without permission, they would be severely punished. But now, it has returned to the path of the waning of the yang and the waxing of the yin. In short, since the promulgation of the National Calendar, that New Year was the most celebrated!</p>
<p>New Year's Conclusion Sangzi</p>
<p>New is the opposite of old, so the establishment of the new must have its old object. If there is new without old as the object, and old without new for comparison, then the theory of being new or being old fundamentally loses its foundation. At the same time, the division between new and old cannot be observed from a historical perspective, but only has temporal and spatial relationships. For example, "New Year" in relation to "Old Year" is only a difference in years, and there is not much difference in social form. Moreover, we can often see that what is considered new here is exactly considered old there; what was considered old in the past may not necessarily be called new now. Therefore, being new as new depends entirely on adapting to the times and environment as the only condition.</p>
<p>"Pushing the old and bringing forth the new" is a natural phenomenon in society and also a natural trend in society. The Great Learning says: "Tang's inscription on his bath tub says: If you can make it new one day, renew it day after day, day after day." This is the principle of social evolution. If the evolution of general phenomena or forms lacks objective conditions and does not conform to the principles of social evolution, even if it is innovative, it only sees a difference, and as a result, it will inevitably lead to self-destruction and self-defeat. For example: the "new government" advertised by general "puppets" and Japan's advocacy of a "new order," let us put aside its causes and its content for the time being, even in terms of its form, it violates general political or international common sense. Its fate and its ending can be foreseen.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that all disguised newness will be shattered and collapsed before the spirit of the new China, the construction of the new China, and the military force of the new China that will grow in the scorched earth. The New Year has already told us: "It will be the conclusion that the trend will turn in favor of China."</p>
<h3>Fleeting Life Like a Dream</h3>
<p>— Yan Hua</p>
<p>“You Can't Take it with You”</p>
<p>Columbia Pictures presents, Cathay Theatre screens</p>
<p>Frank Capra's initial work to garner global attention in the film industry was "It Happened One Night." Subsequently, he consistently produced films like "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" and "Lost Horizon." "Fleeting Life Like a Dream" is Capra's latest work following "Lost Horizon." The original stage script won the Pulitzer Prize, and the screenwriter Robert Riskin is a well-known screenwriter at Columbia Pictures.</p>
<p>The entire film features over ten famous actors, including Edward Arnold, who plays a major entrepreneur in the banking world; Lionel Barrymore, who plays an elderly man in his twilight years enjoying retirement; Jean Arthur, who plays Lionel Barrymore's granddaughter and the lover of the banker's son; James Stewart, who plays Edward Arnold's son and Jean's lover; and Mischa Auer, who always plays comedic roles, as a Russian dance instructor.</p>
<p>The story is simple: an old man's granddaughter and a banker's son are deeply in love, but due to class differences, the old man's granddaughter leaves in shame and anger. As a result, the area where the old man lives is forced to be sold, causing another banker to go bankrupt and die. In the end, this banker, who possesses immense economic power, is moved by his son's departure and the death of the other banker, realizing the unreliability of his career. He abandons everything and goes to the old man's house to revel and make merry with everyone.</p>
<p>While sitting in the theater, the 120 minutes of the film (14 reels in total) deeply moved me. After watching the entire film, I have three thoughts:</p>
<p>First, the playwright's intentions are similar to those of "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town." They both reject the current system of a money-driven society. They express anger and discontent towards skyscrapers and all luxurious material possessions. In "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," the protagonist gives his land and property to all the poor farmers; in "Fleeting Life Like a Dream," the banking entrepreneur abandons all his business and retires.</p>
<p>Second, we believe that the playwright's starting point is correct: he rejects the current money-driven society. However, his actions are flawed. He portrays the protagonists of both "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" and "Fleeting Life Like a Dream" as individualists, which is the biggest mistake in both scripts.</p>
<p>Third, we absolutely reject the main theme of "Fleeting Life Like a Dream," which believes that "money is an external possession; you can't take it with you when you die," and then, like the banker, abandons his career. We believe that all public services that benefit the public should be done. If one exploits the public for personal gain, that should be condemned by the public. Such a view as in "Fleeting Life Like a Dream" only represents passive individualism.</p>
<p>However, the entire play is indeed exceptionally successful, especially in emotionally rich scenes. It can move people to tears. For example, in depicting the loveliness of human relationships, the director's skills are profound and easy to understand, outstanding and lively, truly worthy of being called a superior director. The contrast in the overall atmosphere of the film is very strong, which can be seen in the following scenes: When Banker Koppe defeats another banker and grasps the authority of the economic world, three methods are used to depict Koppe's loneliness and emotion: first, Koppe's staff urges him to attend a meeting; second, another bankrupt banker comes in and scolds Koppe, saying that he will become like him in the future (and then faints); third, Koppe's son comes in to say goodbye to his father. Koppe, with tears in his eyes, rushes out of the meeting... In the courtroom scene, the judge fines the old man 100 yuan. Everyone refuses Koppe's money and raises the money on the spot in the courtroom. Finally, Jean shouts loudly, Mrs. Koppe faints, and photographers rush in, creating chaos in the court... Finally, in the old man's house, Koppe joins their harmonica performance, and the crowd cheers and dances wildly... These three scenes are too exciting and powerful.</p>
<p>Edward Arnold and Lionel Barrymore have the most scenes and perform extremely successfully. Jean and Stewart are also very good.</p>

<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 1: One-Armed Elder Organizes a Free Village; Twin Daughters Pay Respects at the Martyrs' Grave</p>
<p>Speaking of that school principal, he is already over sixty years old this year. He was originally a local villager. Because he had studied for several years, he opened a private school in a small town twenty years ago, enrolling twenty or thirty students. Among the students, some were fifteen or sixteen years old, and some were seven or eight years old. The ages were uneven, and the levels were also different. Fortunately, he taught everyone without discrimination. No matter which family's children wanted to study, he welcomed them all. Although it was a village school, it wasn't just "reciting 'Heaven, Earth, Xuan, Huang' for a year." He also used modern textbooks and imitated the classroom style of schools in the city. Behind the teacher, there was also a blackboard, and he often used chalk to explain new words to the students. However, the place was very simple. He borrowed a local temple and set up a few plank tables and benches, and that was it. He charged each person one dollar for tuition every six months, not including books and paper, which probably cost only twenty or thirty cents every six months. The rural families in that area were still diligent, and the land was fertile, so many children could afford to study. Therefore, almost all the children in that village were his students. However, he had a habit: every morning when he got up, he would go to the small teahouse in the town, where he would wash his face and brush his teeth. He would bring his own teapot and tea leaves, spending three copper coins for hot water every day, and he would drink until nine o'clock in the morning, when he would go to teach. At four o'clock in the afternoon, after school, he would go to the small teahouse again. Therefore, people called him "Teahouse Head." However, villagers relied on farming, and when it was time for the busy farming season, even the children had to help work in the fields. Even the children who couldn't do much work had to deliver meals and watch the cows. So, during this time, the village school teacher was free and spent all day in the small teahouse. Later, he came up with an idea: schools in the city had two vacations a year. One was called summer vacation, which was during the hot season; the other was called winter vacation, which was during the cold season. His school also had two vacations a year. One was called planting vacation, which was during the early summer. Moreover, many silk farmers in this village were also busiest at that time. The other was called harvest vacation, which was during the autumn. These days were also the busiest time, and the children had to help their adults with farm work. After the harvest was over, they also needed to rest for a few days and enjoy themselves, so he thought it was most appropriate to have vacation during this time. (2)</p>

<h3>The Joys and Sorrows of the Film Industry Last Year</h3>
<p>— Yin Ge</p>
<p>Generally, the film industry in the isolated island over the past year has been moving towards recovery. The active productions of Xinhua and Huaxin, the revival of Yihua, and the establishment of companies like Yaosheng and Guohua/Jifu all indicate that the film industry has new vitality. However, in terms of personnel, there have also been many joys and sorrows that are worth recalling. Now, let's categorize and record them below:</p>
<p>(1) Sorrow</p>
<p>The performance of a tragedy, the fall of a superstar, Shang Guanwu's "Alas, alas," is the most significant loss in the film industry over the past year. Many people shed tears and lamented his death because Shang Guanwu had considerable achievements on the screen. However, his amiability and sincerity were also the main reasons for earning people's sympathy. The most unfortunate thing is that Shang Guanwu's death was only a few months after his marriage to Yin Xiucen's niece, making Yin Xiucen's niece a "new bride" who soon became a "widow." When Shang Guanwu's body was lying in state at the funeral home, Mrs. Shang, while shedding tears, said to people, "I don't believe he's really dead! This is a play!" How desolate this is!</p>
<p>(2) Joy</p>
<p>Chen Yanyan gave birth to a baby bird. That was on November 22nd last year. On the third day after the birth, Chen Yanyan distributed red eggs generously, twelve for each relative and friend, without discrimination. On the full-month celebration, she held a grand "Tangbing" banquet at the Shuyu Sichuan Restaurant. Most of the male and female stars in the film industry were invited, which was like a grand gathering of filmmakers. Chen Yanyan and her "husband" Huang Shaofen greeted everyone warmly. Chen Yanyan was all smiles, and Huang Shaofen was also all smiles.</p>
<p>(3) Separation</p>
<p>There were two cases of film actors divorcing in the past year. One was Yu Guang and Mei Lin. Yu Guang's original name was Yu Fukang, and Mei Lin's original name was Qian Zhaolin. Before their marriage, Qian Zhaolin's father had proposed a condition to Yu Fukang, which was that he was not allowed to film any more movies. After their marriage, Yu Fukang once worked in a mining company recommended by his father-in-law. Because he didn't do very well, he later changed his name to Yu Guang and returned to the screen. Soon, his wife Qian Zhaolin also changed her name to Mei Lin and joined the film industry. After their marriage, they had two children in a few years. Unfortunately, in the spring of last year, Mei Lin was suddenly attracted by material things and had an affair with a Dr. Yan. Yu Guang and Mei Lin finally divorced because of this.</p>
<p>The second case was Lu Luming and Xu Xingzhi. After the war, Xu Xingzhi left Shanghai for Hong Kong and did not return for a long time. Lu Luming successively starred in several films in Shanghai, such as "Sunrise" and "Scandal," and suddenly became popular in the film industry. When Xu Xingzhi returned to Shanghai, Lu Luming had become a lover in the arms of a car-owning class, and the cohabitation relationship with Xu Xingzhi ended invisibly.</p>
<p>(4) Union</p>
<p>Two marriages were consummated in the film industry last year. One was Chen Yanyan and Huang Shaofen, and their engagement and marriage were both public. The other was Yuan Meiyun and Wang Yin. The union of these two lovers was initially half public and half secret, and they only officially became husband and wife after the war. There were two divorces of film couples and two unions in the past year, which was exactly "balanced."</p>
<h3>The Self-Admiring Charlie Chaplin - Six Beauties... A Fleeting Moment! - I wonder what Ms. Baohua thinks?</h3>
<p>— Fang Ermu</p>
<p>Slapstick master Charlie Chaplin has maintained his position in Hollywood film history for fifteen years, and is still welcomed and supported by the world. This Ms. 資丽 is his seventh leading lady. After "Modern Times," which she starred in with Chaplin, was released, it caused a global sensation. However, when the film arrived in Germany, it was subject to some minor disturbances due to the exclusion of Jews (Chaplin is Jewish).</p>
<p>Recalling that Chaplin fifteen years ago was 1923, when Hollywood was in the era of silent films, the female lead in "The Kid," which he co-starred in with Jackie Coogan, was Edna Purviance, a figure he noticed. She helped Chaplin shoot several slapstick short films, gaining a considerable position. She continued to star in Chaplin's self-written and directed "A Woman of Paris." Later, she gave up screen work and lived her happy life in Hollywood. The second was Lita Grey. Chaplin fell for her, filmed a few movies, and they got married. Soon, they had a son, but he died at birth. As a result, there were conflicts between the two sides, and they separated. Paulette Goddard was a Spanish dancer. She had eyes that flashed like lightning and a willow-like waist. She captured Chaplin's heart, and they immediately cohabited, giving birth to two sons. At the same time, Chaplin was preparing to film "The Gold Rush," using her as the female lead, but she was good at stage plays, so he had to leave her due to some unavoidable problems, and compensated her with a lot of alimony. Georgia Hale was the fourth unfortunate woman. She continued filming the unfinished part of "The Gold Rush." She soon joined Fox Studios and is now retired. The next one is Kane 乃第. Chaplin and she filmed a movie set against the background of a circus, which was translated into Chinese as "The Circus." It took fifteen months to complete the filming, and this Ms. Kane left Chaplin. The sixth was Churchill. She was a Chicago socialite. He introduced her to Hollywood to film "City Lights," playing a blind flower girl. It took thirteen months to film, and it is said that she is now married to a gentleman in London. Finally, let's mention Paulette Goddard. She came from stage plays and was favored by Chaplin, starring in "Modern Times." They did not marry on the surface, but they cohabited in secret. Recently, film magazines have reported news of their separation. This is just a rumor, and we can laugh it off. I am not in a position to predict the future outcome.</p>
<h3>Actor News - Gu Wuwei Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Gu Wuwei, the leader of the Hong Kong Lee Theatre Standard Drama Troupe, arrived in Shanghai on an Italian ship the other day. Yesterday, he met with reporters. According to him, his mission here is to resolve family matters and other miscellaneous affairs. Currently, the Standard Troupe is supporting the situation in Hong Kong and is barely managing. As for the personnel, he has recruited many people in Hunan and Guangxi. If there are suitable roles in Shanghai, he also plans to invite a few people. In the afternoon, Mr. Gu ordered his daughter Gu Baolian to visit Wang Xichun backstage at the Carlton Grand Theatre to inquire about the address of Kun Dan Chen Yujun. Lan Chen in Hong Kong once made a guest appearance at the Lee Theatre for three days and was very popular with the Hong Kong people. It is likely that Mr. Gu wants to hire her to return to Hong Kong. Mr. Gu also told reporters that Lin Shusen has been brewing to go to Hong Kong for more than a day, but it has not been realized. If he is willing to go, there is a possibility of negotiating cooperation.</p>
<p>Xiao Sanmazi Negotiates Renewal</p>
<p>Since the famous actor Xiao Sanmazi joined the Tianchan Stage, he has been very popular with the audience. As of the day before yesterday (New Year's Eve), his contract has expired. The front desk is negotiating with Xiao Ling about the conditions for renewal, requesting half of the monthly salary, while Xiao Ling insists on two-thirds, so no agreement has been reached. However, the two sides are still negotiating. If a break occurs, Xiao Ling will leave after performing for three days (helping out for three days), or it may be possible to salvage the situation and perform until the end of the year. How things will be next spring will be negotiated again.</p>
<p>Li Zhonglin Will Accept a Southern Invitation</p>
<p>Since Mr. Dong Zhaobin's China Stage, which he organized, failed to update the stage, he is still actively looking for a site. On the one hand, he is inviting roles. Li Zhonglin, a Wenwu Laosheng recruited by Mr. Guo Chunpu, has replied, agreeing to go south after the overall situation is stable, with a salary of 3,000 yuan. Currently, Zhonglin is performing in Tianjin and is very popular with the music lovers.</p>
<h3>The So-Called Truth, Beauty, and Goodness</h3>
<p>— Yan Youxiang</p>
<p>There are three major elements in making movies: namely, "Truth, Beauty, and Goodness." Truth is reality, beauty is art, and as for goodness, it is not betraying the justice of mankind. These three conditions are the focus of any film! Some people do not interpret "Truth, Beauty, and Goodness" this way, but in the current environment, I think it is necessary to say so.</p>
<p>I once heard a friend say that Chinese films are now gradually moving away from reality. His words are quite right. Film companies have indeed undergone some changes recently, but I personally have an unwavering view: that a film that deviates from "Truth" and emphasizes "Beauty," no matter what, cannot deviate from "Goodness"! You must know that of all things in the world, only "Goodness" is enough to be immortal. If you want a film to have a backbone, to deeply move people, and even to be embraced by people, the key is to have the existence of "Goodness"! Qin Shi Huang built the Epang Palace, which was beautiful, but goodness was completely lost, and in the end, he was scolded by people! What time is it now? If you think about it, you will not think my words are nonsensical.</p>
<p>Leaving the old and welcoming the new, another year has begun. In addition to reviewing the past, we must consider the future. I am a film worker, and I always talk about my own profession. Therefore, I record my humble thoughts above, awaiting the correction of those who know better.</p>

<h3>Congratulations on the Staging of the Yang HuaiChun Love Homicide Case</h3>
<p>— Que Shuisheng</p>
<p>After the sensational He Die and Yang Huaichun love homicide case in Shanghai, various entertainment venues competed to collect information about the details of the case and adapt them into scripts for performance. The Lianyou Drama Troupe of the Great World has completed the arrangement and is scheduled to premiere the evening show on the sixth of this month. Mr. Xu, the brother-in-law of Yang Huaichun, the protagonist of the case, and the son of barrister Fan Gang, visited Ding Yongchang, the manager of the Great World, and Yuan, the son of Mr. Huang Jinrong, to inquire about the plot. They also talked with Zhu Yan, the director of the Lianyou Drama Troupe, fearing that the plot would be inconsistent with the facts and confuse the audience. They gave detailed instructions so that the public could understand the truth. He Die is played by Xu Renqiu, the pillar of the troupe, and Yang Huaichun is played by the romantic young man Yin Mengshi. The two are known for their acting skills and are praised by the audience. When it is staged, they will definitely be able to bring out the plot completely, so that the audience can sympathize with these two lovers who sacrificed for love and cry out in pain for them. Alas!</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (6) (2)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Again, Most of Tan Pai's Plays Were Taught by His Wife</p>
<p>This girl often kindly made a set so that the old man would favor her, and of course, he didn't want to go against her wishes in any way. In this way, over the years, the old girl has heard at least thirty or fifty operas, and she can sing with a similar tone and flavor to Old Tan. Youchen also often watched Old Tan's operas, and he had a phonograph at home. All seven and a half records of Old Tan were bought, and he imitated Tan's tunes all day long. In addition, he had a good talent and had a clear voice. At that time, there were not many people learning Tan's style. Jia Honglin's voice soon broke, Wang Yutian had died early, and Gui Junqing learned Tan's style, which was the same as the later dog seller. Youchen married the old girl home, and in the boudoir, "husband and wife sang in harmony," and soon she taught him all the plays that Old Tan emphasized singing. As for plays that relied on props and those with a little martial arts, he had to put them aside. (meaning he couldn't handle them) I remember once at the Grand Stage, he reluctantly posted a "Dingjun Mountain," and the poster said it would be with 崭渊. Who knew that he said halfway through the play, "I can't do the rest." The stage manager knew that he couldn't do it, but if he didn't sing 斩渊, he was afraid that the audience would riot. He quickly took Zhang Rongkui to the backstage by car (Rongkui had already finished his play and gone home) and discussed it with him, and finally, Xia Houyuan was beheaded. At that time, the "with" character on the poster, such as "Release" with Inn" and "Black Basin" with Road," was written as "代". This "Dingjun Mountain" was no exception. However, all the other "代" characters were inappropriate, only Youchen's "Dingjun Mountain 代斩渊" was indeed appropriate; because he had temporarily asked Zhang Rongkui to "代" for him.</p>
<p>Youchen first came to Shanghai in the early years of the Republic of China, and performed at the New New Stage hosted by Huang Chu Jiu. The accompanying qin player was Sun Laoyuan, and the drummer was Liu Shun. He also hung a sign for Sun Lao with the words "China's No. 1 Qin Player." Both Sun and Liu were old people of his father-in-law, and with the title of son-in-law of a great Tan king, he was enough to call for attention at that time. Later, when he performed at Yiwu Stage, he also used Xu Lanyuan and Hang Zihe, who were still the scenes used by Old Tan in his later years. Even so, he still couldn't guarantee that there would be no mistakes. Once, I heard him play "Release," and he actually sang two sentences, "The horse is in the narrow road and it is difficult to turn the horse," which made Xu and Hang so anxious that they were sweating profusely. They quickly whispered to him the next line, "This is the flower following the water, and the water cannot love the flower," and he continued. It can be seen that the ability he learned from his teacher's wife was not authentic, let alone what he was taught by his master's sister-in-law. That being said, but at a time when there is an extreme shortage of talents for Sheng, to be honest, Youchen's "Entering the Palace," "Visiting Mother," "Bumping the Tablet," and "Crying for the Spirit Tablet at the Linked Camp" do have a lingering sound. Unfortunately, he died young. I think if there is anyone who learns Tan's tune but cannot get instructions from Shuyan, why not ask this Mrs. Wang (the old girl)?</p>
