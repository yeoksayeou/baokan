<p>社評</p>
<h3>擴大援華運動</h3>
<p>英美自去年底實行經濟援華以來，曾對中國成立巨額信用放欵。據日昨報載，英政府又已决定對華再作大借欵兩批，第一批借欵爲三百萬鎊，專用以鞏固中國的法幣制度；第二批借欵則爲擴大對華輸出信用担保的限制，已經擬定的數額爲五百萬鎊，其用途爲購買英國交通器材，開發中國的西南國際交通。同時又傳美國對華的新借欵，也將簽訂成立，此外還有歐洲的某友邦，亦準備對華作大規模的經濟援助。從這些消息看來，國際的援華運動，最近是愈趨積極了。</p>
<p>遠東的局勢，現在已經到達很嚴重的階段，國際間加緊對華的援助，這也是一個很適當的機會。我們看日本在中國的占領區域內，封鎖中國的水陸交通，統制中國的商業與金融，破壞外人在華的一切公私產業，威脅外人在華僅存的勢力範圍租界，這已經是盡人皆知。可是日本侵略的野心，並不以控制在華佔領區域和排斥外人在華勢力爲滿足。最近於對華戰爭毫無辦法的時候，竟又發動她的所謂南進政策，預備把她的侵略魔手，伸展到中國以外的遠東其他各地。上月白軍在海南島登陸，乃是直接向法國的屬地越南示威，而對英國九龍租借地邊境從事轟炸，更是彰明較著的對英國挑釁。同時日本在遠東其他各地，也進行着種種威迫利誘的擾亂工作。例如對緬甸，日本則派遣大批和尙女尼商人學生去作反英宣傳，竭力煽動緬甸人民叛變；對於葡屬的澳門，因爲不能得到葡政府供給日軍利用的允諾，竟對漢口葡領加以毆辱逮捕；對於菲律濱爲鞏固國防而預備封鎖台孚港的計劃，日本也以對日不利而提出無理的抗議；對於荷屬豐富的煤油區，更無時不在垂涎攫取之中。總之，日本已視整個遠東爲她掌握中之物，她决不許任何歐美國家在遠東留下一絲一毫的勢力。這就是日本時常所喊的「亞洲爲亞洲人之亞洲」的口號的實踐。我們相信，在最近的將來，也許就是她的歐洲同志再作殖民地要求的時候，日本會藉口斷絕中國國際交通而在亞洲發動一個大規模的戰爭。現在一般和遠東有關係的歐美國家，都感覺到急於需要設法防禦。英國已在新加坡和香港修築堅强防禦工事，荷蘭也在東印度羣島增强軍事設備，法國更是積極加强越南的陸空軍事力量，以謀阻止暴力的侵入。不過這些方法，都不能阻止侵略勢力不來攻擊，能夠阻止侵略勢力不來攻擊的，却祗有積極援華的一個辦法。</p>
<p>月初英國工黨議員斯特拉波奇勛爵在上議院發表演說，他說：「蓋吾人倘以遠大眼光觀察時局，當能見及中國乃爲吾人而作戰」這是多麼胆大心細而一針見血的話！的確，中國這次的抗戰，不僅是爲維護本國國權而戰，也就是爲着英美等國所同様重視的民治主義而戰，也就是爲着保全歐美各國在遠東的政治經濟權益而戰。並且，在遠東的現勢中，祇有中國抗戰的勝利，才能保全歐美各國在遠東權益的安定。現在中國的抗戰，快要接近到最後的勝利，、在軍事經濟方面，也急需友邦的援助。凡是和遠東有關係的國家，在這中日戰爭即將進入决定階段的時候，爲正義，固然應該積極援華，爲保全自身在遠東的權益，更應積極援華。英國沙遜爵士量近回國公開演說，主張英國應當積極援助中國，這最足以表明久處中國深知中國國情者的眞正見解。</p>
<p>國際的援華運動，確然已有漸趨一致的傾向，不過，僅以經濟援助中國，固能加强中國抗戰的力量，却未必能因此而迫使日本改變其獨霸太平祥的企圖。民治國家倘欲堅1决遏止日本侵略野心的發展，必須更進一步，擴大援華的範圍，而從相對方面拿出經濟制裁日本的辦法來，那才易於在最短期內終止她的侵略戰爭。</p>
<h3>重慶婦女八日爲三八　寮美齡發表演講　努力增進民族地位　自認為民眾的奴僕　擔負抗戰建國責任</h3>

<p>（重慶）蔣夫人宋美齡女士在三八節紀念會致詞、原文錄次、各位同胞、今天我們開會紀念三八節、這個三八節决定爲國際婦女節是一九〇九年在丹麥京城開會時所决定的、到今天恰恰三十年了、所以今天是三八節的三十週年紀念日、我們中華民國的婦女們在敵寇侵略、國家艱苦的今天、在一面抗戰、一面建國的今天、來舉行這一個重要的紀念、我們每一個人的心中、必然有一種特殊的感想、三八節的意義、正如各位所周知、是在求得女子的解放、但是所謂女子解放、不僅是解放了就算了、是要由我們女界同胞的努力、增進我們民族的地位、要使民族生活受到女子的影饗、因而提高它的精神物質兩方面的標準、使大多數乃至全體的同胞都得　獨立自由平等的幸福、我們要認識女子解放、不能單單當作一種權利看、應該當作一種責任看、我們爲什麼要求女子解放、爲的是要負起我們女子的責任、換一句話說、我們要眞正求得女子的解放、首先就要我們先能負起責任、我們總理孫先生在民國十三年演講、有幾句很重要的話、他說「革命不能成功的原因、就是個人爭自由、忘記了國家的自由、要曉得國家沒有自由、個人就不能自由」、這是十分眞確的道理、我們今天來談女子解放、也要院得國家沒有解放、我們全國的女子就得不到眞正的解放、我們國家今天受敵人這様的欺侮侵略、整個民族處在暴力的重壓之下、全國同胞流離痛苦、我們不先把這個危難的國家扶救起來、我們四萬五千萬人都要做亡國的奴隸、更從何處談女子的解放、更向何人去要　求女子的解放、我常常說女子解放要看我們女子本身的努力、如果我們女子的知識能力有不斷的進步、我們女子對民族和世界人類有確實的貢獻、女子的地位就自然而然的提高、現在或者有人以爲女子參與政治是求得女子解放的第一步、這句話也許是對的、現代的國家都不能否認女子要有參政權、可是女子解放眞正的意義並不是祗求得女界少數人得到政治上和經濟上的地位、乃是要解放大多數婦女的痛苦、改善大多數女同　胞的生活、從教育和組織着手、來增進婦女的能力、提高婦女的地位、而且實際說來、只講婦女解放還不够、還要用我們婦女的力量來達到全民族同胞的解放、纔算盡了我們的責任、</p>
<p>今天到會的有許多婦女團體的代表、有知識界的婦女、有職業界的婦女、也有勞動界的婦女、我們這些人在二萬幾千萬女同胞中、算是比較有能力有地位的、雖不能說是先知先覺、至少是在水平以上、我們得想想我們該怎麼様纔不辜　負我們自身的知識與能力呢、我們該怎麼樣纔不辜負我們所受的教育和訓練呢、該怎樣纔對得起我們的　國家民族和我們　所處一的時代呢、尤其重要的我們這許多婦女團體、該拿怎麼樣的態度來對一般同胞有所貢　獻呢、我舉一個故事來告訴大家、記得荷　蘭女皇維廉海娜幼　小的時候、她的父親已經去世了、有一天過十歲的生日、她的母親爲她舉行慶賀、就有成千成萬的男　女民眾到皇宮外　來賀她、幼年的女皇看見這種熱烈的景象、高興極了、感動　極了、就問她的母親說、「這些民眾是不是屬於我的呢、」她的母親說、「不是的、不是他們屬於你的、而是你屬於他們的、」我願今天到會的女同胞們、也要認識我們是屬於民眾的、不是民眾屬於我們的、我們做一切活動的時候、切不可自認爲我　們可支配民眾、而要自認爲民眾的僕役、我們要接近民眾、深入民眾中間、誠心誠意的爲同胞服務、去教育他們、扶助他們、解救他們的痛苦、創造他們的幸福、在現在這個非常時期、國家和國民的禍福利害　是一致的、我們若不能求得抗戰勝利、我們民族就不能生存、我們建國若不成功、我們任何人　就沒有一些幸福、</p>
<p>今天我們的女界同胞各人都要衛量自已知識能力的大小、定責任的輕重、誰的知識能力越大、責任就越重、我們要有熱情，有毅力、有辦法、更要有組織去擔任種種有關抗戰的工作、我們要提倡節約、勸導生產、推進社會教育、主持救濟事業、鼓勵從軍殺敵、協助抗戰宜傳、凡是有益於抗戰建國的工作、男子能擔當的、我們也要當仁不讓的擔當起來、尤其重要的、而且是多數女子都能做的我以爲無過於安慰出征軍人家屬和協助出征軍人家屬、我們要經常慰問前線將士和陣亡將士的家族、使他們精神上得到安慰、我們還要扶助他們能够自立、譬如舉辦工藝、組織手工業、傳授農業生產技術、帮助組織合作社等等、使他們經濟和生活不發生困難、並且帮助他們解决子女教育的問題、這様出征軍人們沒有後顧之憂、一般同胞們就可以踴躍應微上前棧、我們兵役問題有了順利推行的辦法、抗戰就一定勝利、國家就得到保障、我相信以我們女界的精神、對於抗戰一定能貢獸很大的助力的、祗要看星期日女界獻金的成績、就可以使我們有確實的自信、女界獻金爲什慶能有這様的成績呢、完全由於我們有組織、能團結、也有堅忍克苦的精神、我們女界能够一致動員、不分彼此、把或多或少或大或小的力量、一齊貢獻出來、纔有這樣的成績、但我以爲我們的工作多得很、不一定件件都要有表面顯著的成績、我們的工作、祇是發動於我們愛國的天良和責任、我們應該不希望誇耀、不希望贊揚、也不需要鼓勵、而埋頭努力於更刻實的工作、越是不求人知的工作、功效越是大、我們從艱苦踏實的工作中夫做無名的英雄、不求個人的榮譽、而以羣策羣力求得國家民族的榮譽、這様我們必定能够實際H作中、提高我們女子的地位、達到我們更崇高的目的、</p>
<p>各位同胞、我們這一次抗戰、是正義和暴力的戰爭、是民族存亡的關頭、又是國家復與的序幕、我們現在應該一切不問、一切不顧、專心一致的求得抗戰的勝利、我們要知道正義公理是屬於我們的、世界上全人類的同情是屬於我們的、我舉幾個例子來證明、第一件我提出給各位看一件寶貴的贈品、這是一位印度女子從他的身上解下來的、她說「她對日本强盜的殘暴、懷着極深的痛恨、對我們中國抗戰起無限的同情、對我們中國女同胞努力抗戰工作、是萬分的感動、她沒有什麼可以表示、就把他僅有的財產也是她身上一刻不離的飾物、解了下來捐贈給中國、」我請各位看看、在這一串環練上是寄託着多少的深情、第二件是我們接到一位美國盲目女童的來信、還附贈金圓一枚、她信上談是一個不幸的女子、但她聽到中國受敵人蹂躪如此殘酷、中國男女孩童的痛苦是這様的深、她對於敵人對中國殘酷的行爲、都能了解、並不盲目、她覺得她再不應該自怨不幸、她表示慚愧、她又表示對中國女同胞從事抗戰的勇敢、感到無限的興奮、這一封信和來月萬里以外的一枚金圓、眞足使我們感動、第三件是我接到另外一位外國女子的來信、她說她的未婚夫和朋友出游、不宰死了、她自己患着半身不遂的病症、但爲了正義人道觀念的驅使、對中日戰爭十分的關念、天天要看報、天天祝禱中國勝利、醫生怕她多受刺激、甚至不許她看報、她自己不能寫信、只好託她的朋友代寫、這封信希望我們中國同胞能持久努力、求得最後勝利、各位要知道我近來所接到國外的來信、一天總有好幾封、上面不過隨便舉幾個例子、我們看萬里以外的異國友人、尙且如此、我們都是中華民族的女兒、更應該如何勉勵、自己鞭策自己、來救起我們的國家、求得我們國家民族的解放呢、以我們自身的犧牲奮鬥、求得國家的解放、和二萬幾千萬女同胞眞正的解放、我十分確信是一定能達到我們的志願的、我願今天到會的女同胞們、立定决心、向前奪鬥、爲世界婦女運動史上寫上最光榮的一頁、（八日電）</p>

<p>日本有赤化危險　决不能征服中共國　英國僅致力遠東貿易　日不能蔑視各國權益　沙遜爵士返滬之談話　　大陸報云，上海重要金融家沙遜爵士，近週遊世界頃巳返滬，七日抵埠未幾，記者即走訪，據沙氏談其觀察稱：余近在東京接見日本記者時所談，與日本報紙之紀載，必多誤會。第一點，余信日本决不能征服中國，日軍或能在戰事上獲勝，但不能以武力壓制如中國之國家，縱或能以武力壓制矣，余亦不信日本之經濟富源，力能擔任開發其侵佔土地之任務。其二，余不信可對任何國家實施裁制，蓋實施裁制，巳證明其無效也。如各國對意裁制之無效，即其一例，即對共他任何國家出此，亦必無效。（此言可爲前傳沙遜曾以商業理由反對裁制之佐證）關於此點，近聞英政府頗贊同余之見解，日方消息傳稱，余曾言英國乃唯利是圖之國家，余未作此言，然余不欲與彼等爭論之。英國在中國無政治與領土野心，英人來此，僅與遠東人民貿易而巳。英國在此所作任何投資，乃爲發展貿易計，英國將對日作金融上之援助乎？决不，日人休想吾人資助之，蓋日人曾用以威脅將外人悉數逐出中國也。英國絕無對日貸款之可能，日本又何能盼吾人予以金融上之援助乎？日本並未考慮對開發中國負任何責任，亦未保證將尊重並保護以往外國之投資，英國人民自然同情華人，如日本遭蘇聯進攻而被征服，吾人或亦表同情於日人也。　　援助中國自屬應當　　沙遜對日方所傳渠在東京曾謂中國勝利將危及英國利益之說，予以否認，並稱：余在日本時，曾有以此問題叩諸余者，余祖白告之曰：日本不僅未使中國脫離其將成之「赤化」，抑且迫使中國投入「赤化者」之懷抱矣。記者詢英美民意是否贊成對華貸予現款或信用放款，沙遜答稱：吾人何以不應援助中國歟？日本新聞記者曾詢余緣何援助中國，余不知何以不應出此，事實上英國前僅以少數軍火供給中國，而中國之大部份軍火，均來自歐洲，日人應知爲自身之利益計，而未對中國宣戰，則休想盡得未宣戰之利益。日本希望他國對渠供給軍火，而不供給中國，但何故僅日本應得軍火歟？國際公法亦無是項要求。余在東京曾語日本記者曰：日本之同盟國者德國，在西班牙戰事中之行動，遠逾其所應爲者，不僅以軍火供給國民軍，抑且供給「赤色者一德國在西班牙且對雙方供給軍火，則日人在遠東焉能獨倡異議歟？苟英國對華予以信用放款之便利，殊無不應出此之理，亦無不應對華貸予現款之理，英國對華予以信用放款之便利，大都擬用以購買卡車，余確信中國尙未利用此款，因中國對此無迫切之需要也。余意美國之信用放款，刻正首先動用•　　日本頗有赤化危險　　記者詢渠信英·美·法·諸國之金融界均贊成對華貸予現款乎？沙遜以簡單之語答曰，中國擁有資產，且有大量白銀存於國外·復稱：余不信英國將援助日本開發其侵佔區域，如「滿洲國」與華北均在其列，苟他日日本請英美予以金融上之援助以開發此等區域，則余信非待日本保證將保護所有外國利益，以爲報答，則英美决不出此，余在日本時，有以英國是否將承認「滿洲國」相詢者，余答：英政府在此動盪之時，將有何種舉動，非余所知，但認爲任何外人均無權向何國陳述與該國願望相反之意見。日本之有赤化危險，遠較中國爲甚，余感覺日本確處於進退維谷之地位，蓋如㣘從一般意見，而退出中國，則必召回其軍隊而對所冒之危險所嘗之困難將絕無成就，可昭示國人也。日本士兵於戰後，旣一無所獲，頗有轉向共產主義之可能，此即日本處境，何以若是窘困之故。日軍退出中國，必引起國內騷動，日政府處此情勢，將何以對付其民眾歟？故日本旣不能征服中國，亦不能退出中國，吾人希望對解决遠東大局作具體建議者，均信日本須先使其人民逐漸明瞭其地位，日人務須瞭解彼等不能壓服憎惡日人之民族，余仍曰，日軍在戰事上可獲勝利，但此非中國爲日軍佔有之謂。余雖以爲可與日本合作以開發亞洲者，必爲無外國武力協助而組成之中國獨立的政府，但非附庸之中國所能出此也。每一國家必須選擇其自己之政府，而不能籍外團武力爲助而决據之，此即余所以相信非日本明瞭此，則遠東大局不能獲有解决之故。　　中国决非臣服國家　　沙遜復涉及中英兩國之友誼云，中國决非臣服之國家，英國從未在其帝國內榨取任何民族之膏血，日本無對待中國如對待叛亂國家之權，亦無能置外國在華利益於不顧之權。苟日軍欲使各國對其目的稍寄同情者，則應知不能攫奪一國之資產，而不負該國債務也。日軍不特置外國利益於不顧，甚且持有股票之外人，亦不能視察其財產，如鐵路即其一例，股票持有人並不要求，亦不希望獲得逕赴戰綫視察之權，但後方有廣大之區域，今應開放，而任彼等往來也。英國投資者在華並無領土野心，若有新中國者以中國爲後援，而非藉外國武力爲後援，欲購買外國在華之投資，則余斷然確信投資者與任何外國政府均不致起而反對也。余留日時，曾晤許多商人，余覺較年長之商人，甚或較年少者之軍事領袖，均無與余之見解相牴牾者，但未明白告余耳。余信彼等衷心均欲戰事即此終止，勿再延長也。　　沙遜地位左右外交　　關於猶太移民問題，沙遜云：余曾數度訪問各國志在爲移民作佈置一切，余信移民不能成羣結隊前往任何國家，而必須以漸進之方法行之也。按沙遜於去年三月杪離滬，此次渠希望留滬參加春季跑馬會，但未能確言將留滬若干時日，預定在短期內將赴香港盤桓兩週。又日本右傾極端主義者中野正剛，星期一日曾向上海日人演說稱；去年六月初，日機轟炸廣州時，最受驚惶者莫過於沙遜爵士，蓋長江流域全區與華南，均有其根深蒂固之權益，廣州被佔，其權益乃受威脅，渠之使英國外交部有所行動，乃輕而易舉之事，蓋就東亞而言，英外部不啻爲沙遜之代理機關耳。駐東京英大使克萊琪爵士，與當時日本外相宇垣會談關於保護英國在華利益事，實因沙遜而起。茲者，沙遜返滬，道出大阪，竟圖以甘言蜜語，誘惑日本之金融家與商人云。忠義軍第三中隊襲擊新龍華站　衝進月臺搗毀站房　秒獲子彈一千餘發　區隊長張才根殉國　　前晚十時許、駐紮滬西之忠義救國軍金大隊長、特派第三中隊長沈嗣、帶同健兒百餘人、沿滬杭路、向新龍華車站日軍警備隊襲擊、該隊田邊部下日軍、連護路隊三十餘人、均從夢中驚醒、不敢應戰、紛紛向東逃竄、各健兒遂衝進月台、將站房搗毀、並抄獲步槍二支、子彈千餘發、及軍用物品甚多、沈隊長見任務已舉即整隊返防繳令、詎行至滬閔路惠靈學校相近、突遇上海中學日軍大隊救兵趕到、雙方即發生遭遇戰、一時槍聲大作、子彈橫飛、區隊長張才根（新龍華人年二十八議）身先士卒、勇義奮發、不幸被流彈擊傷、當場殉難、沈隊長爲避免無謂犧牲起見、即下令退却、咋已呈報上峯、請爲嘉獎、以示鼓勵、日在大連　印鉅額偽鈔票　二千餘萬運滬轉甯混用　　財部通令各地嚴密注意政部近據密報、謂日方陰謀破壞中國幣制、擾亂金融、故經在大連僞造鉅額僞鈔、已有二千二百萬元、運滬轉寗、企圖在各淪陷區混用、特於刪日電令各省政府轉飭所屬及商會一體嚴密注意、原電云（上略）據報（一）敵「滿」軍在江浙佔領區、購辦米糧、用僞造之中國銀行新十元紙幣付米價、（二）敵在大連、設廠僞造中中交鈔票、已有二千二百萬元、到滬轉京、委漢奸推銷混用等語、除分電外、特電請查照、飭屬嚴密注意、查究主使暨帮助行使之人犯、依照懲治漢奸條例、從嚴究辦等由、准此、除分行外、合行電仰查照、迅即轉飭所屬、一體嚴密注意爲要等因、奉此、自應運辦、除分函外、相應函達、迅即轉知所屬會員、一體嚴密注意爲荷、長江上游日傷兵　分批運注　分裝各艦　載送回國　　長江上游戰事再起後、因由平原戰爭易爲山地戰爭、情勢轉變、日軍重兵器均失效用、故日兵傷亡之數、亦較前激增、最近有大批傷兵四千名左右、分裝運輸艦當陽丸·陪陵丸·宜陽丸·三艘、當陽丸於四日到滬、陪陵丸於五日抵滬、宜陽丸於六日抵滬、均泊滬東日商大阪碼頭、而虹口遼陽路之中國亞浦耳燈泡廠、則被臨時闢作傷兵站、上項傷兵、分批進廠暫駐、前日由萬噸巨型紅卜字艦朝日丸、停靠黃浦碼頭、通夜　將此項傷兵、轉舁上艦、昨日白畫、繼續裝運傷兵、已於傍晚、將三四千名傷兵裝完、定今日清晨、啟椗運回日本、大量日磁器　運滬傾銷　　　磁器爲吾國著名土產、每年出口額奇鉅、惟戰後因運輪困難、出口數量激减、而日磁進口、反大形增加、不斷運滬傾銷、其售價低廉、一般奸商力予推銷、致進口額與日俱增、據海關統計、一份日磁運滬、計四十五萬九千七百九十九元、而去年同期、則祇二十三萬一千八百十七元、幾增加一倍之鉅、昨日婦女界紀念三八節　　界昨日爲「三八」婦女節、是婦女界爭求解放、抵抗壓迫的紀念日、本市各婦女團體、各女學校、均分別舉行紀念式、或舉行聚餐會聯歡、或赴收容所慰問難胞、婦女界以民族解放、爲婦女解放之前提、當此神聖抗戰、着着推進、最後勝利不遠之日、彌感責任之重大、深資警惕、益加奮勉、今後决繼續努力、實踐節約救難、及教育事業等工作、以擁護政府、完成抗戰、並加惠難胞、工部局議董　選舉競急　美僑推定候選人　他國將無甚更動　　大陸報云、每年一度之工部局選舉競爭、巳在進行中、蓋美僑聯合會昨日（六日）宜佈、該會之工部局選舉委員會、已推工部局現任總董樊克令、與美孚油公司助理總經理康尼煦兩人爲工部局議董候選人也、委員會不接其他推舉之候選人、則不必舉行預選、因美人在工部局議董中僅佔兩席也、如復有候選人之姓名、於三月十八日正午以前送交委員會、則其姓名將加入候選人名表、而在預選中推選之、工部局選舉、定四月十二及十三日兩日舉行、距今僅月餘、本埠盛謠、刻正企圖將美國無綫電公司總經理美人史蒂華及愛理思律師事務所之英籍律師瓊斯列入候選人內、據咋夜所悉、所傳推舉史蒂華一舉、與史氏近在工部局加薪爭論中活動有關、他國僑民團體均尙禾宜佈其候選人、惟聞將無甚更動、至美僑聯合會候選人之更動、乃因美國鋼產公司經理普蘭特已於去歲返美、致缺一席故也、天津停業　冬令檢疫　大沽口春融水解　　江海關接津海關港務長谷利思通告、對駛往天津及塘沽中外船隻、停止冬令檢疫、業巳轉告各航商知照、茲探錄津海關港務長谷利思通告如下、查關於由傳染病區域駛來天津及塘沽之中外船只、冬令檢疫辦法、會於上年第二十三號港務布告公布在案、現已春融冰解、上項冬令檢疫辦法、應自本年三月一日起、予以撤消、惟凡由傳染病區域駛來船隻、仍須在大沽口或深水處停泊候騐、俟領得交通許可證後、方准進口、除呈明稅務司核准備案外、合行布告中外航商、一體周知、浙東　鮮蛋柴炭運滬　浙海甌海兩關　業已遵令放行　　本市各商行、在浙東採辦之鮮蛋柴炭、前因經濟部禁運來滬、積存甬溫兩處者甚多、現經濟一部已核定通融辦法、憑商會證一明、由關騐放、連日浙海甌海兩關、遵令辦理鮮蛋柴炭兩種土貨、運抵本市租界者、陸續不絕、供給日常需要、巳不虞缺乏、楊樹浦堆棧　日軍械庫火警　焚燒達閘小時原因損失未詳　　據八日法文上海日報載稱、昨日下午五時、楊樹浦DKK第二號棧房、忽然發生火警、聞該棧房原爲堆存製帽之草類、但自日軍佔據虹口以後、即被其攫爲軍械庫之用、是以火警發生甚爲猛烈、其起火原因及損失詳情、則日軍不許外人進棧、以至無從探悉、但聞焚燒達兩小時之久、方始稍煞、偽警　忙於調遣　組「憲捕隊」防滬西　日軍令調僞警協助　　最近僞「維新政府」藉口恐怖事件、「再宣傳遺派僞綏靖部隊」五百名、來滬增防西郊、但因僞「軍」份子複雜、上海日兵、又極單薄、深恐彼等乘機譁變反正、故此說迄未辦到、惟虹口日憲兵總隊、則迫令僞「市府」强抽僞「警」二百名、組織僞「憲捕隊」冒充日憲兵、發給槍械、將還往滬西增防、連日在僞「市府」廣場、施行軍事訓練、一待制服製成、即常派出、且工作時因扮裝日兵、故不許開口、以免露出馬脚、聞此輩僞「警」、膽小如鼠、恐發槍後、反被游擊朦認作目標、招致殺身之禍、故抽訓以來逃亡已有二三十名之多、又聞偽警三千六在餘名奉日華中總司令山田令、不日將調防、協助日軍、警備四郊、偽「地方法院」長　另委江某繼任　江某怕死當不敢出醜　　自僞南市「地方法院院長」屠振鵠被殺、因與浦東僞「司法處」權利上之衝突、寗滬兩偽方爭執過烈、以致合併問題、又陷於僵局、茲聞僞「司法行政部長」胡礽泰、新近另委一江某繼任僞「院長」職、仍於僞法院與浦東偽「司法處」取對峙性質、惟江某胆小如鼠、鑒於屠復之可怖遭遇、未敢登台出醜、徘徊南京、尙未來滬接事、余哲文律師　開始執行律務　　余哲文律師、別署空我、服務於新聞界垂二十年、對於社會人情動態、具有極深切之體念、與法理互相印證、闡發獨多、近已加入上海律師公會爲會員、

<p>衣食住行周刋　住的專頁蔣委員長的住  水鳥　　在一般充滿着封建思想的人們，總以為蔣委員長住的地方，一定富麗堂皇，有如王宮似的。其實，他生學好這個時代，負着巨大艱苦的責任，難得一地，停住較久，所以也就沒有如人們想像中的這般有安逸的清福。在平時，他不時巡視各地，在戰時，他更親赴前綫，像這樣不定的生活中，自不能深藏在象牙之宮裹，以求居室之美，而且常時借住他人的住宅以為臨時起居之所。如前年在漢口時，即借住漢口郊外怡和村楊森的駐漢公館；在成都的時候，則借住劉文輝之公館；至其昔日在南京，在其本鄕的住宅，也都利用舊時建築，略加修改而已。在江西臨川（撫州）時，曾因為預備長期圍勦紅軍的便利起見，特在臨川中學的一塊空塲的西端，建造一正方形的大平屋。這一房屋的形式，比普通略有不同，四角方方，又很高朗；窗戶很多，各間皆可相通，據說是蔣委員長親自設計的。他言定在那次戰事平後，即可指撥作該中學之用，不知現在可仍無恙否？裹面的陳設也很簡單的。寢室中兩張床並靠着，四旁壁上懸掛着蔣委員長夫婦的幾張紀念照相及對聯。寢室地位略高，接下一間就是浴室。他自已的辦公室內，寫字抬很是寬大，後面放着的公文櫃箱，每一抽屜都分別標明事項類別，這是很適宜於思考的地方。房屋中間，就是會客廳，二壁掛着精密詳細的軍用地圖，這些陳設，是蔣委員長在各地住處的相同情形。惟在其本鄕溪口由文昌閣改建的住處裹，更多着許多可資紀念的照相，一進大門，就能看到蔣委員長侍立於王太夫人側旁的放大照相，在南京的住處，尙有一幅繡繪着中華民國大地圖的地氈，鋪置在大客廳中，旣極新奇名貴，而且更有深長的意義呢！村居記樂  哀離　　辛亥革命成功，予隨外子劉三由杭返滬，隱居鄕村，閉門種菜，有時藝蘭蒔菊。時先翁愛菊，外子嗜蘭，予獨好月季，每晨餐而後，同入小園，撫視各花。蕙蘭較喜陽光，若風日晴和，日光不烈，乃移盆景，置向陽處片時，土須潤而不燥則花易繁。花瓣似梅似荷者為七品，緣瓣白而包心為異種，素心次之，四者之外，其餘不足論矣。花時領其馨逸之氣，如空山久寂，忽逢幽人，雖相對無言，而已兩忘形跡矣。外子謂酒能令人遠，於此花亦然。月季為維揚名產，予以重金購得，色有淡紅嫩黃白色三種，愛其色艷香濃。長日相對，怡然自得，是花香氣頗厚，故滬人名之香水花也。唯壽命不長，雖加意護持，三稔而後，漸漸枯萎，予甚惜之，殆土性不佳使然。菊則種類甚多，不能枚舉，亦有綠荷金帶玉帶等為上品，三春時摘取嫩頭種成菊畦，俟其生根再移置盆中，至秋時須摘去旁枝花蕊，則花大而美觀矣。憶彼時一門怡然，度清閒之歲月，幾不知人世間，尙有憂患。是歲適先翁古稀之年，九月生辰，予等奉觴無量上壽，諸貞壯先生，有賀壽詩二律，中有奉親遂作逃名計，結客曾聞戒飮詞，白髪進觴無量　，黃花環屋盛開時之句，當時朋舊投贈詩畫甚多，今則悉遭刦掠矣。外子酒友，若鍾海航，陸更存，黃賽虹，姚鵷雛諸先生均下過寒舍，作長夜之飮，狂歡達旦。予盡主婦之職，招待溫酒，以深宵僕役均眠，有時助興，亦飮數觥，鷄鳴主客皆醉，及今思之，眞所謂勝會不常，盛筵難再矣。孤島二房東塑像旅館種種  沈錫身　　上海的旅館業向來是很發達的，而在八一三以後的今日，更覺生意鼎盛，這當然是各地避難人紛至齊來的緣故。因為在這尺土寸金，人多屋少的孤島上，找房子實在是一件很困難的事，於是有許多中上階級的避難人，就以旅館作為暫時的棲身之所，也有開了房間長期居住的。因此每一家旅館的每一間房問，幾乎天天有人寄宿，旅館的大門口常常掛着客滿的牌子，眞是門庭若市，盛况空前。　　其他還有許多藉開房間以作消遣的特殊旅客，他們不但有閒，而且有錢，所以也最為旅館中的茶房們所歡迎；搭子齊了不妨打幾圈麻將，高典起來再呌幾位嚮導女來談談心，他們的生活眞是優閒得很！　　住旅館確是很舒適的，尤其是住在上等旅館裏，像飯店，公寓之類，設備是多麼完善；夏備風扇，冬有水汀，一年四季，溫暖如春，電鈴一捺，侍者趨迎；處身其中，大有樂不思蜀之概！但有一個先决條件，那就是法幣必須充足，否則，假使一旦床頭金盡，旅館老闆下起逐客令來，這才要使你啼笑皆非呢！　　每夜九時以後，是旅館中最熱鬧的時間，各色旅客，都在這時活動，牌聲劈拍，京調悠揚，一直鬧到午夜，眞是良宵苦短！一到早晨，則　靜寂得鴉雀無聲，因為旅客們在這時好夢方酣呢！房東房客的畸形發展  乙之　　孤島上擠滿了人，住的問題就嚴重起來。同時，做二房東的就大交其運。誰都希望做個二房東，可以乘此機會發一票財。於是，一幢小小的房屋，由甲租給乙，乙轉租給丙，丙轉租給丁……，互相利用，彼此賺錢。所以，甲是二房東，乙也是二房東，丙丁也是二房東。因此，「二房東」就成了「孤島土產」之一。　　但是，除去二房東之外，還有一種「三房東」，「四房東」之類，信不信由你。　　我家對門是一爿米店。米店的二房東是隔壁麵館。米店的後客堂，前樓，後樓，亭子樓，二層擱，三層擱都是出租的。但是其中後樓和三層擱的三房客却分租出一部分給兩個獨身漢，這二個米店的三房客豈不是一搖而為「三房東」了嗎？而那兩位獨身漠却做了米店裏的「四房客」了。尤其有趣的，那位住在二層擱裏的，「四房客」還把自己的床，出租一半給一個擺測字攤的。這樣，那位住在二層擱裹的「四房客」就變成了「四房東」，而那位擺測字攤的豈非是做了「五房客」？假使那位「四房東」的床很大的話，那末，我想那位擺測字攤的，可以分出四分之一來租給另外一個人，而自己就可以做「五房東」了。　　本來道件事是局外人所不知道的，因為有一天早晨為了「對房錢」的糾紛，就把這件「秘密」拆穿了。　　那末，我們可以猜想，假使住的問題不澈底解决的話，以後將有更麻煩更複雜的糾紛出現。因為不久的將來——也許就在眼前，關於房租的糾紛，已不單是大房東與二房東的事，也不單是二房東與三房客的事，而且還得加上三房東與四房客的事，四房東與五房客的事，甚至於是五房東與六房客，六房東與七房客的事了。　　這是好現象嗎？覓屋難  秋郎　　我友虞君，他是一個公司中的小職員，每月的收入也很有限，平時敷衍生活已是勉强，何况在這非常時期的今日，各公司商舖，厲行緊縮政策，裁員减薪，算不得一回事，虞君雖幸未被裁，但折减薪資，當然難逃其例！他家本住閘北，戰事發生後，倉猝避入公共租界戚家，那戚家不久，又來一武邑鄕人，性情至為暴戾，甚至互鬨，喧賓奪主，對他竟下逐客令！日前承他吿我，最近為覓屋困苦備嘗，仍難找到他能够負担租金的房子，首下大有啼笑皆非之概！我雖為他深表同情，可是愛莫能助，徒呼奈何，因作歌為記，我想孤島上與我友感同等痛苦者，當不在少數吧，歌曰：　　何處去覓屋，橋南與浜北，日日苦奔波，處處盡角逐，「衣食」與「住行」，「住」字推其獨，縮食儘節衣，如何可露宿，君從閘北來，狼狽奔戚族，情讓一椽棲，何期遇荼蝮，竟下逐客令！中心頓栗六，托人兼自覓，居宅終難卜，相處似針氈，妻憤孥啼哭，孤島寸金地，自昔傳滬凟，况在今日下，災黎滿坑谷，傷哉房產主，叵測何心腹，不解救同胞，任意强要索，天寒歲又暮，誰憐此窮蹙，慢道食無肉，先感居無屋，老杜仁者言，垂今共銘讀，安得廣厦千萬間，天下寒士盡叨福。怎樣避免火災  新亮　　每一年無數次的失火，幾乎都是由於某些人的不小心。所以，全個美國曾在去年的十月九日至十五日之間，大規模地舉行了一次防火週。其目的，就是呌每個人，無論是男女老幼，都要注意。當時，每個家庭裹，有一個專家派來視察一周，幷且將種種的防火方法講述給人們聽。更有伊德納公司者，發表了下列一組問題，以作一般家庭避免火災的預防策。　　在寢室裹：（一）有人在床榻上吸烟嗎？（二）有火柴放着嗎？假使有的，就請你看看它們是否是放在安全的地方。（三）倘若在夜間突然起火，有門可以從寢室很便利地走往屋外去嗎？這種通路，切不要呌其他東西阻礙住了。　　在浴室裹：（一）可移動的電爐與氣爐之類，是放在衣服，毛巾，及其餘易燃物的旁邊嗎？　　在厨房裏：（一）火柴必須要放在最安全的匣子裹，否則它們是極容易引起火災的。（二）把火爐放在靠緊牆壁的地方嗎？（三）火爐的烟囱有誘洞嗎？一切接合的地方是否是不漏氣的？（四）曾用爐灶來烘乾濕柴嗎？（五）灰燼是否是很小心的除去，而不使熱的煤屑掉落在地板上的？（六）抹布，帳幔之類是否是放在遠離火爐及烟囱的地方？（七）燒小菜的時候，有熱油濺開來嗎？你知道它是很容易釀起火災的嗎？（八）用電灶的人家，常常在對它施行檢視嗎？　　在客廳裹：（一）備有專門置放雪茄烟與香烟灰的盤嗎？（二）假使室內也設有火爐的話，就請注意在厨房項下的各條問題。（三）就寢之前，曾將火爐熄滅嗎？（四）使用的燃料是否是最安全的？（五）把字紙簍放在易燃物的旁邊嗎？　　在地層裹：（一）燒　的熱燼，油布與其他慶物，是放在有蓋的金屬桶裹嗎？（二）角落裹，階沿下，木架上有舊報紙，破布絮等等東西堆積着嗎？你要記住，它們都是容易引起自然焚燒的。（三）爐灶的底部周圍有磚石，或水門汀保護着嗎？（四）最近有專家來視察過你的爐灶嗎？（五）你使用煤氣嗎？你要不時的查察煤氣管子有無漏洞。幷且更需切記，在自已進行視察的時候，除了用電筒之外，絕不可用火柴或火把來照光。　　在便所裹：（一）衣服與紙張之類堆放得齊整嗎？（二）便所通風嗎？（三）肴人帶了火柴或洋燭入便所嗎？（未完）　　愛國學生應佩樂善章</p>

<p>自由談徹底抗戰有的效果  茂烈　　二十個月堅决的抗戰，巳經收得了不少的效果。舉最近的事實來說，則有英美繼續對我貸款，和平沼「準備與蔣將軍所領導之政府，作中止敵對行為之談判。」　　我們總還記得吧：當初英美對於我們的吿貨，不是多所顧忌，不肯答應，便是暗中接濟，略予點綴。最大的原因，當然是怕我們失敗了，他們將一無所得。我們總還記得吧：當初我們的敵人不但高唱速戰速决，並且還悍然宣言，不與蔣委員長所領導的政府談判，氣勢之盛，似乎不可一世。　　可是我們在這種情况之下，並沒有失望，更沒有氣餒，只堅决地抗戰着。變了，逐漸變了，現在英美居然肯為我們的將伯，而平沼也不惜代其前任近衛，收回那狂妄的宣言「不與蔣政權談判」了。　　當然，只要我們徹底抗戰下去，將來的情勢，還是要大變特變的。英美與我完全合作，而平沼或其後繼者再收回慶「重慶政府不能為中央政府」的謬言，就將迅速地次第實現。我們瞧着吧。　　所謂徹底抗戰，便是：不向敵人求和；在敵人沒有退出國土之前，尤其沒有退出東北之前，更不理敵人的求和。換言之，徹底抗戰，便是：不以抗戰為隨時談判的手段，而以抗戰來達到我們最後的目的：保全我們的領土——東北當然在內——與主權。　　這不能說是我們的高調，更不能說是我們的奢望。事實吿訴我們：敵人正在威逼利誘，無所不用其極，要我們上他們的鈎，我們只有以此徹底主張來作答覆；而「有志竟成」，「事在人為」，「天助自助者」，更為人人所熟知的原則，這些原則在最近的已往，已著其成效，那末在最近的將來，牠們的成效當然會使我們如願以償的。　　什麼「反共協定」！什麼「東亞新秩序」！在我們徹底抗戰之下，不過一陣烟霧而已！跛和尙  雁朋　　你瞧！一跛一拐的穿過疏林，那個跛和尙又走進村落裹來啦。　　跛和尙的禿頭在陽光下閃閃發亮，掃帚眉，兩顆鴿子蛋樣的眼珠子亂轉，一臉橫肉沾滿油泥，　着靑色的破衲兒，脚穿黃僧鞋，扶着拐杖；望着茅簷下晒太陽的莊稼漢：　　「你們都吃過飯了啊？哈哈：今天倒怪暖和！」　　張大着四方口，露出兩排黃了根的牙齒。　　你若看他面貌兇惡就疑惑他是個輕狂的惡僧，那算是你錯了！——他是個勇士，有着一段光榮的經歷，不信你聽：　　「你們猜猜看，我是怎麼跛的？」　　和尙放下拐杖，倚着木樁搬着跛了的右腿。　　「大師傅：我們怎麼會猜得着呢？還沒人知道你是那處寶剎的和尙咧！」　　莊稼漢中的胡七這樣回答。　　「對呀！我也太糊塗囉，昨天和諸位談有半天，直沒說出自己的來歷，今天可得說啦！」跛和尙咧着嘴笑道：「我是安徽靈瑩縣漁溝廟裏的和尙，出來七八個月啦！」　　「可是大師傅，你到底怎麼跛的？」　　胡七遞過板橙，跛和尙坐下，沉默片刻。　　「這說起來算是我的刦數。去年四月間，×軍到了漁溝，許多婦女聽說×軍信佛，便跑進廟中躲避，本想借着佛光掩護免遭奸污，誰知那一天，七八個×軍進得廟裹，向泥菩蔭磕頭的時候，突地望見幾個婦女影子，就大發淫慾，跳起來去拖拉她們，强行非禮。當時我怒火中燒，舉起禪杖開了殺戒，一個×軍，被我打開了腦袋！」　　莊稼漢聽得熱鬧起來，齊聲：　　「咦！大師傅，其餘的×軍能和你甘休嗎？」　　「其餘的×軍多嚇跑了，只有拿着雪亮亮的鬼頭刀的兩個東西，却一齊的向我亂殺亂打起來，」跛和尙咳嗽兩聲接蓿說：「結果都被我打得頭青眼腫逃跑了！我恐怕×軍拿槍來復仇，便咬牙切齒的跑出廟來。——可是，我的膝蓋骨便在這次被斫傷了！」　　跛和尙說到這裹，把右腿的褲角捲上去，果然膝蓋骨上有一條疤痕。　　「大師傅倒有勇氣。現在住什麼地方」？　　莊稼漢們關心的問。　　「我是個　脚的和尙，沒有一定的住處。」跛和尙接着說：「不過，我無論什麼地方，總會說出這些話。」　　「對你說吧，大師傅，」胡七噴了口烟說：「我們這莊上人多是些壞蛋。那時×軍來了，一個人也沒有敢害牠們的，任牠們搶掠婦女。後來我看大家實在忍不住了，我才要約起來，成立保鄕團，結果也做去了不少×軍。」　　「×軍沒有人性，到處殺燒淫掠，罪惡深重，肚量寬宏的佛爺也不會饒恕牠們的。咱們中國人只要齊心，我想不遠時日便會打光×軍的」！　　踱和尙說了，又掇起拐杖吿：　　「明天再談啊」！　　一跛一拐的，跛和尙的背影被蒼茫的暮色迷糊了。死之舞蹈  戴蒼奇黃昏的留惜  忽栔　　早晨是最美麗不過的，它代表一切新的氣象；然而和早晨一樣美麗的，還有黃昏。　　黑暗可怕，假如沒有燈光的點綴，徒有慘白的月兒和微亮的小星，那也只有癖性的詩人雅士愛好它了。况且黑暗裹有惡魔，也有鬼怪。　　當太陽已經落下了山，晚霞漲紅了天的臉，參鑲蓿橙黃靑紫的雲，襯托出它底溫和，白天的光還彌漫着天地，雖是有些糢糊，和早晨差不多，可是它旣不像黑暗的森怖，也不如白畫的强烈，它是適中，我覺得它非常可愛。　　但是黃昏太可憐了，它只承受白畫的一點餘渣，不久黑暗就來侵蝕它，呑沒它，它立刻消了。　　黃昏是美麗，可愛，値得頌揚的，却很快會得消失，我們感到如何的惋惜啊！少辜負一點時光，少把黃昏當作無用的時光，免得萬分的惘悵。　　黃昏與早晨是相同的，但是它比早晨來得更有深刻的意義。要留惜它啊！必到  耿之　　所謂「到」，不是作文章的「眼到手到」，也不是作畫時「筆隨」的「意到」，乃是「脚到」。　　到什麼地方？不是「有事」必到的「三寶殿」，乃是的確「無事」要到的「×寶殿」，其例甚多　　某處開會，必到。某處有演講，必到。某公司，某銀行，某娛樂場所，甚至某蠟燭店，某棺村店（殯儀館等於棺材店）開幕，必到。某公某名流發表談話，必到；即不發表談話，某公某名流的公館，不時必到。國內外要人抵滬，在碼頭歡迎，必到；同樣，離滬，在碼頭歡送，必到。某菩薩開光，必到。某少年男女百年偕老，必到。某老翁某老媼慶壽，必到。某死人出棺材，必到。……　　這樣的人，原不能說是壞人，假使他們做的事情，不過到東到西，兩脚走如飛而巳。然而，也不能說他便一定是好人，因為他到這裹，到那裹，除了幫幫場子，點綴點綴，使別人成個局面以外，其他便一無用處。　　但他這種必到的目的是什麼呢？別人看他無事忙，他自己總有個目的吧。據我猜想，假使他還是個安份守己者，那他的目的，不過要別人認得他的面孔，作着自我宣傳，充其量也只想附庸風雅，或者攀龍附鳳，自躋於要人，大亨，名流，學者之列，高其聲價而已。一言以蔽之，還只是貪圖一些虛榮。所保不定的，「虛榮」之外，往往還要緊接着「實利」，那他們的存心，就不可究詰了。　　不過社會上對他們很歡迎。因為他們旣已因着他們的無處不到，有了相當的整價，正可以利用着他們，以為某種某種號召。他們大都不搭架子，往往一請就到；　不搭架子，往往與電影明星，坤伶，舞女等為伍，欣欣然面有喜色。他們的口碑是：某先生很熱心；某先生很和氣。　　然而他們雖無處不到，却也有他們的「不到之處」的。否則他們分身乏術，假使人人要請他們，他們又將何以應付呢？而他們的不到之處，不是別的，還是他們的常到之處。這或者要使你稱奇了吧？　　原來同樣是「×寶殿」，例如某處，某公館某店，或某等人來去的碼頭，或某人的某種場合，只要那裏人不多，聲勢不浩大，沒有大好老，或者那大好老已失勢，更或者那裹並無「油水」或其他利益可沾，他們立刻可以不到，憑你磕頭也不到。這當然不能怪他們，「人有不為也，而後可以有為，」於是乎「脚有不到也，而後可以有到。」　　這樣一說，「到」上之「必」，似乎已經成了問題。但是這到底不能怪他們，他們是準備着「必」的，誰呌你們不足以引動他們「必」的心呢！他們原是「白鴿子」，只「望旺邊飛」，也只「添花」於「錦上」；不妨再舉例以明之：　　同是必到的菜館，而眞正必到的乃是「大菜館」，或××飯店之流。同是必到的跳舞場，而眞正必到的乃是一元三跳或者什麼紅星舞后的宮或廳。同時必到的賭場，那眞正必到乃是輸盤，跑馬，跑狗，諸塲。……　　「人望高，水望下」。大地方必到，小地方不到，實在是必到的精意。我們對於精通此意者，只有點頭稱善。中篇小說烽火中  周燕　　這時，在儀門口左右耳房裏埋伏着的兵士，也都衝出來了，恰好獨眼李的黨徒，在對面茶館裹聽到了槍聲，也紛紛衝進鄕公所來接應，於是，兩下便展開了一塲混戰，槍聲砰砰的響着，流彈嗤嗤的四處亂飛。　　梁團附拼命吹着哨子：　　『咮——咮咮！』　　『合字，風緊，快跑！』獨眼李向黨徒們打了個暗號，盧放了一槍，便在黨徒的簇擁中，逃出了鄕公所的大門。　　『咮咮——』梁團附一面吹着哨子，一面指揮埋伏的兵士向外追趕，　　『誰捉住獨眼李的有重賞！』葉團長高聲命令着。　　獨眼李和黨徒們衝出了鄕公所的大門，便向東南方奔逃。外面雖也嚴密佈置好了，但因事先沒有準備巷戰，兼之一般民衆驟然聽得槍聲四起，警哨亂嗚，不明眞相，個個驚慌失措，有的關門閉戶，有的在街心裏亂竄，妨礙了軍隊的動作，所以雖然格斃了幾個黨徙，畢竟被獨眼李脫逃了。　　葉團長和梁團附督率手下兵士一直追到市梢頭，眼見獨眼李和他的黨徒們逃進一片樹林裹去，並且藉樹林作掩蔽，向外射擊，只得廢然地停止了追趕。葉團長嘆了一口氣說：　　『眞想不到，我們佈置得這樣周密，還會給他脫逃！』　　『早知這様，我們應該事先通知民衆才是。』　　『通知民衆又有什麼用處，要是他們事先驚慌起來，只有更加壞事。我也不知怎樣，剛纔那三槍，明明都打中在他身上，他却絲毫沒有受傷，，眞正奇怪！』　　『也許他穿着避彈馬甲。他旣是鹽梟土匪，手下黨羽衆多，不會沒有這東西的。』　　『現在沒有別法，你趕快去召集民衆，呌他們趁早防備，我想獨眼李逃了回去，一定不肯死心，說不定會勾結敵人，到這裏來搗亂。』　　『這當然是很要緊的。不過民衆剛受了驚嚇，不見得就敢出來，稍待一兩天再呌他們準備也不妨。現在更要緊的趁獨眼李驚魂未定的時候，以迅雷不及掩耳之勢，率部到苕溪鎭去，剿滅他們，這呌做先下手為强。』　　『我看還是不要把他們逼得太急，諒他們一時也不敢來進犯這裹，要是他們竟彰明較著的去投降敵人，那時再剿滅他們也還不遲。』　　葉團長這樣說了，便和梁團附回到鄕公所裏，一面辦理復員，一面呌兵士們把格斃的　麻子和其餘的幾個士匪，抬到野外荒地上去掩埋。（二八）</p>

<p>游藝界上海的白俄歌舞團  幻想　　白俄歌舞團的歌，雖然不是每一個人能聽得匯，白俄歌舞團的舞，雖然不是每一個人看得明白，但是，在上海它却能够吸引大量的觀衆。每屆演出，不論是在第幾輸的戲院裏總是賣一個滿座。這種現象，顯然的一般人並不是意嚮着歌舞藝術而共趨，却是抱着一個「醉翁之意」欣賞「肉」的希望；演者祇迎合了觀者的心理總給予一種肉的透露，於是在互相利用的情形下，一般流浪的白俄都有着以肉的歌舞來維持他們的生活的機會了。因此，在某一時期白俄歌舞團的確蓬勃了一陣。　　他們的組織，雖然簡單，但頗健全。樂師舞女之中也有不少沙皇的高貴後裔，現在為了生活的艱難，卻不計什麼出演的代價，所以最受一般次級戲院及遊藝場所歡迎，尤其是兩年以前低級戲院不景氣的時期，他們因為要用一種刺激的方式去調劑色情狂的觀衆，來挽救營業上的頹衰，都紛紛聘請，在電影映畢之後加演，以致使幾個歌舞團應接不暇了。　　代價最高的，每天大約二百元以上，最低的只有五十元；論次數計算的，每次十元的都有。這種代價若以全團人平攤起來，一個人演出一次的代價，也只够飽裝一次肚皮而已。　　他們的演出，一般人眞無從批評，除對於俄語有相當程度的人以外，聽蓿那種似歌非歌的音調，看着那似舞非舞的動作，亦無從領略羅松風味的歌舞藝術。她們唱的什麼歌，跳的什麼舞，恐怕只有她們自已曉得；好在觀衆也不在乎此，祇要看那兩條肥白的大腿，兩隻麵包似的乳房，就足够償付兩角或四角錢的門票代價，何况還有等於赤裸的什麼舞演出，—目前中國女子的歌舞中風行一時的草裙舞，就是從這裹脫胎而來的。　　現在「孤島」因為人口集中，一切事業都相當繁榮，電影院也用不清以「肉」來號召，因此，白俄歌舞團除了遊藝場裹尙有點綴外，各戰院的演出可說是極稀少的了；而同時，有一部份舞女和琴師也有比較好的出路：有些舞女已在虹口的酒排間內伴舞，有些琴師也在作代搬物件或代某種人駕駛汽庫的職務，這在物質的收入上，自然比載歌載舞好得多了。所以上海的白俄歌舞團現在巳减少了許多，也許會逐漸歸於淘汰吧？醇酒廬劇話（中）  屮屮　　珠簾後，為得意緣，自訪壻起，至惡餞止，實八本中之前四本也。花旦章遏雲，小生葉盛蘭，老旦馬富祿，正旦芙蓉草，花臉劉連榮，皆一時之選，戲中精采處頗多，本戲脚色，搭配如此完全，捨荀慧生外，尙不多見，此戲原共八本，慧生去蕪留菁，一日演完，實陳墨香與王瑤卿二人潤色之功，瑤卿昔年飾二娘，可以喧賓奪主，視狄雲鸞如配角，美蓉草得其餘緒，巳足使章遏雲生色不少，瑤卿眞人傑也。老旦一席，昔推羅福山專擅，在民十二以前，除羅福山外，無人敢任此席，富祿不知學自何人，唱較羅氏悅耳，做派則尙不及，惟在今日，巳不多見矣。葉盛蘭乃今日小生中傑出人才，唱做固佳，扮相尤美，袍帶戲及靠把戲，如羣英會九龍山等，南北歌台，堪稱獨步，共演巾生，少蘊藉意，得意緣偏重風月，實屬巾生之正工戲，若俞振飛演之，必能合拍，盛蘭是日，大致完美，惟要好太過，嫌做作氣太重，以至頭上所戴武生巾上之雙繐，脫落五次之多，凡藝術皆貴自然，不尙做作，獅子搏兔，何必用全力，割鷄亦何必牛刀。愚昔見程　仙與荀慧生合演此戲，以吳彩霞飾二娘，亦有異趣，盛蘭用力過猛，不特頭巾上雙總脫落已也，其抬腿撩衣時，將腿直舉甚高，然後樞衣，其腿工誠足驚人，但在風月戲中，祇要風流瀟洒，妙趣橫生，并不貴乎有此腿工。記得昔年奎派唱坐宮時，楊延輝入場，先跨右脚，再踢左脚，然後再跨脚轉身，鑼鼓用四記頭，亦以表顯腿工為能事，譚鑫培議其非老生所宜有，刪除不用，誠有卓見，今南北老生均奉為圭臬，與愚意正合。銀海一勺  玉繩　　陳燕燕在銀幕上，與觀衆暌違已久，頃楊小仲將導演「琵琶記」古裝片，决定由陳燕燕任女主角，不久開攝　　吳永剛之新作，以「水滸一人物林冲魯智深之故事為題材，原定名曰「雪夜復仇記」，茲已改為「雪夜殲仇記」，由金燄飾林冲，李紅飾林冲妻，章志直飾魯智深，服裝由盧世侯設計，巳拍過呆照，日內即開始攝製。　　將在金城大戲院公映之「化身人猿」，亦為一恐怖片，王引飾人猿，有攀登二十層高樓之危險鏡頭，此片作風，與西片「倫敦人狼」頗有相似處。　　王元龍在藝華公司，將導演「燕子李三」一片，李三為北平劇賊，數年前報端屢有關於李三入獄出獄之記載，王元龍將於片中自飾李三一角，乃弟王次龍亦參加演出．王元龍於此片完成後，將徇新華之請，主演一片。　　文逸民導演之「神秘夫人」，原定由黎明暉主演，因黎不願演老太婆角色，遂改派路明飾妙年時代之神秘夫人，徐琴芳飾老年時代之神秘夫人；女票友汪戀姑，亦將在片中客串演出。游藝珍聞　　名旦黃桂秋於天蟾舞台演唱期滿後，將移至史新舞台接蓋呌天父子之後隊。　　卡爾登大戲院移風劇社原定今晚起重演頭本文素臣，因觀衆要求多演舊劇，故决定展延一星期至下星期四，（十六號）演出，前晚周信芳與綵頭主任羅增祺會商偉大佈景數塲　　大中華劇場戴步祥邀聘鼓王劉實全南下演唱，劉已覆函同意，並開來名單，將偕梅花大鼓鞏小霞，河南墜子喬清秀，相聲張麻子，謝瑞芝等於農歷三月間來申，包銀德數為三千至五千元米定，座價擬一律售洋一元。　　蘇州蘇州大戲院委音樂師吳炳福在申邀聘歌舞團赴蘇演出，吳定今日到蘇向該院當局接洽一切。　　影星陳雲裳，陳燕燕，童月娟，黃紹芬等前晚在卡爾登戲院觀周信芳，王熙春等演唱全本趙五娘。　　中南害塲自衛鳴岐·石筱英·演唱申曲以來，無日不吿客滿，後石因病請假，迄今已有數日，茲聞病已痊愈，靜養數天，即行登台。戲劇消息　　春蟬劇社　重振旗鼓後之「春蟬劇社」，已决定本月十二日假座仙樂大戲院星期劇塲作首度公演，演員計有俞昂霄劉影帆周進甘露粱儀等，彼等均係新進人材，後起之秀。此次登台獻藝，尙屬創舉，屆時諒必車水馬龍，盛極一時，節目有「冷飯」「好兒子」，現日夜排演中。　　雅集平劇　復旦同學所主辦之雅集平劇社，定於三月十一日屋期六晚假座寗波同鄕會二樓為難民籌款演劇一天，戲目誌後，全班演天官賜福，張承炯錢榮中合演文昭關，胡元明姚仁泉合演武家坡，畢可宗毛家麟合演賀后駡殿，龔元愷定軍山代斬淵，陶增棠鴻鸞禧，葉萃英女士何家驥胡馨庵合演坐宮盜令，周振岑龔元愷毛家麟錢榮中合演全本空城計，張錢二君合演之文昭關，因戒嚴時間關係，準於六時半登塲，各界士女，凡持有該社入場券者，務請早臨。　　藝林劇塲　藝林星期劇場每逢星期日上午十時正假座派克路卡爾登上演話劇，歷來次次擁擠，聞本月十二日又屆星期日，劇目挑選最精彩之三本，　前走後奔，　冷飯，　求婚，聞些二本皆出於文學家之手，凡酷愛話劇諸位，此機會幸勿失之。各國禁映片的種類  （陸文表）　　除了若干內容有傷風化，或有辱國體的影片外，還有許多很好的片子，因為含有政治性或其他緣故，每會遭到不准放映的危險，例如：　　在德國，不久前英國所製的偉大名片「垂簾二十年」便遭禁映，原因是為那時英國宮廷中有個大臣是猶太人，不但影片如此，其他如猶太音樂家所作的歌曲，戲劇等，也都在禁止演奏之列。　　加拿大嚴禁放映有關離婚的影片，意大利也是如此。　　新加坡禁映有損白種人威嚴的片子。　　丹麥，挪威和瑞典不准放映含有酷刑的片子，雖小至學校教師責罰兒童的鏡頭，也列入禁片之中。　　墨西哥禁映描寫墨國牧人和美洲紅人故事的影片。棋苑  鮑子波編　陸承鑄校　　第二十二局　殘局摘要　　車砲士勝車雙象　　紅先　　着法　　車四退一　車五退一　車四進七　將五進一　帥四進一　車五退一　車四退四　象三退一　變車四退一　車五進一　車四平七　將五退一　車七進三　象一進三　車七進二　將五進一　車七退四　車五進二　車七進三　將五退一　士六退五　　變一　　車四退四　將五退一　帥四退一　象三退一　車四平九　象一退三　帥四進一　車五進一　車九平四　象三進一　車四進四　將五進一　車四退六　車五退一　車四平七　將五平四　車七進五　將四退一　車七平五　車五平六　帥四平五　車六進三　車五退一　　附啟　今日應刋登開局法因漏登殘局第二十二局特此聲明補登故都宫闈梨園秘史（一二四）  徐慕雲　　孫老元拉胡琴時能吸鼻煙　　民國九年叔岩第一次南來，出演於四馬路丹桂第一憂，同來的琴師就是胡琴聖手孫佐臣，打鼓老大槪是杭子和，這兩位都是譚老板用過的人，當然予叔岩帮助的地方不少。可惜所帶來的配角，只有王長林鮑吉祥二位老伶工，所以有許多好戲，全難見到精彩，有幾齣戲簡直弄得亂七八糟，笑話百出，足見「牡丹雖好。還得綠葉扶持，」這句話眞是一定不易的名言了。有一次余演「打棍出箱」等到「鬧府」一塲，是班底裹的增長勝去葛登雲一角，那時上海唱大花臉的，只有天蟾舞臺的董峻峯同第一臺的增長勝。還算有嗓子，有身個，平心而論，他們兩人都是塊美材，也還能對付着聽聽。却不知增老板那天是甚麼緣故，竟會把「太師府擺酒宴」這段原板二簧的詞兒忘得乾乾凈凈，一個字都紀不起啦，幸虧孫老元的胡琴，手頭靈活，及至瞧他到了過門時，還不張嘴，馬上又接着拉下去，叔岩正坐在對面，連忙低聲提他一提，他這才想了起來。不過原板的過鬥太短，一剎那間又該張口，所以他頭三個字究竟唱的甚麼，恐怕連他自己也莫明其妙。那次臺下雖沒喊倒好，可是叔岩總覺得不順利，幾乎沒把嗓子給　回去，好角正要用嗓子的常見，最怕臺上出岔子，心內一着急，肝火上升，准得把嗓子急壞。幸而觀衆們都能原諒增長勝或因矜待過度，以致有此忘詞黃腔的毛病，才沒報以倒彩，並且未使主角間接受到他的影響，這也足以證明大家愛護叔岩的至意了，</p>

<h3>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon Announces the Establishment of Sino-British Financial Loan, Equalization Fund of £10 Million, British Assistance Half, Praises Chinese Government Stability and Legal Tender Success</h3>
<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon announced in the House of Commons this afternoon that the plan to assist China's currency with a loan has been established, totaling £10 million. British bankers will underwrite half of the amount, guaranteed by the British government to prevent losses. The remaining half will be underwritten by two Chinese banks. It is said that the interest rate is extremely low, and various sectors related to the Far East have responded favorably to this plan. It is claimed that this loan plan is unrelated to any provisions regarding interest and repayment of China's various debts. Responsible individuals state that no actual defaults have occurred on debts secured by Chinese customs revenue thus far, and China has been paying other debts on schedule. Therefore, it is generally believed that China's ability to gain such great trust is due to its ability to maintain its credit despite the significant burden of war and the loss of much valuable territory, while some other countries, without the aforementioned difficulties, have defaulted on their maturing debts. Although this loan plan is now established, it cannot directly affect the monetary crisis in North China. Responsible parties indicate that the intention of this loan is undoubtedly to warn the Japanese that Britain will not allow its interests in China to disappear due to a lack of practical assistance. At the same time, it is also heard that various stringent measures are currently under careful consideration. Some parties are now pressuring the government to impose effective retaliation against Japan immediately if Japan does not abolish its current regulations restricting British interests and freedom in China. Many people who previously supported a moderate policy have now changed their opinions and believe that retaliation is the only hope for obtaining satisfaction. Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon announced that the Treasury has agreed to provide a guarantee against losses to two British banks and is drafting a bill to submit to Parliament for approval. The Chancellor's remarks were in response to a question from Labour MP Lawrence, who asked the Chancellor to comment on suggestions for helping China maintain the stability of the true value of its legal tender. The Chancellor rose and said, "The stability of China's legal tender is of utmost importance to Britain, given our financial and economic relationship with China. The Chinese government has been working for many months to maintain the legal tender, facilitate commercial transactions, and ensure reasonable stability in its exchange rate. This has been a great success. The Chinese government has informed the British government that it intends to continue its current monetary policy and is willing to establish a fund of £10 million in addition to reserves to stabilize the legal tender as part of this policy. It has asked two Chinese government banks to undertake £5 million, and the remaining £5 million has been offered to two British banks, namely HSBC and Mercantile Bank. These two banks have agreed to undertake this amount, but any losses incurred at the end of this fund must be compensated by the Treasury. The Treasury will provide this guarantee. The tentative arrangement is that the operation of this fund will be limited to twelve months, but at the end of the period, it can be extended for a period of time by mutual agreement. However, if necessary, this fund can be terminated at any earlier time. The British government welcomes the establishment of this fund, which, if used properly, will greatly contribute to British trade and enterprise in China. The Treasury has been awaiting parliamentary approval before granting the requested guarantee to the two British banks." The Chancellor concluded, "I hope to introduce the bill early next week." The Chancellor also stated in response to various supplementary questions that the British government's primary responsibility for any outcome will be to appropriately compensate the two British banks, but any profits made by the British banks as a result will be transferred to the British Treasury. Labour MP Bellenger then asked whether Britain had consulted with the United States beforehand. The Chancellor replied that he believed this action would be widely welcomed and that other countries had contributed in various ways. He hoped that when the case was submitted to the House of Commons, the House would also consider it an appropriate contribution. Another MP asked whether the British government had the right to speak on the management of this fund. The Chancellor replied that the stabilization fund will be managed by a committee that will include a representative responsible to the British government. (8th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Hubei Recover Several Key Points, Situation on Leizhou Peninsula Extremely Tense, Japanese Troops on Jingzhong Road Retreat Southeast After Being Attacked, Japanese Troops Attacking Langang in Sanshui Repelled by Chinese Artillery Fire, Elite Guangxi Troops Arrive in Southern Route for Reinforcements</h3>
<p>Yicheng: Most of the Japanese troops on Jingzhong Road are now retreating southeast. Because some Chinese troops took advantage of the Japanese troops' northern advance yesterday and today to launch a fierce attack on the Japanese rear, the Japanese troops, fearing that their return route would be cut off by the Chinese troops, retreated one after another. Some Chinese troops have recovered Yonglong River, Yanmenkou, Wamiaoji, and other key points, killing more than 300 Japanese soldiers and destroying eight Japanese tanks. In the Zhongxiang area, only five or six hundred Japanese soldiers frequently fired artillery at the Chinese side today to create a show of force. The Japanese troops north of Zhongxiang, surrounded by the Chinese on both wings, are in a difficult situation. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Shashi: The war in central Hubei is extremely fierce. Chinese troops from all directions are actively counterattacking and have made many gains. Chinese troops on the Hanyi Road are approaching Wamiaoji. Five or six hundred Japanese soldiers and more than twenty tanks in Sanyangdian have been attacked by Chinese troops many times, and the Japanese have suffered heavy casualties. The Japanese troops in Xiantao Town were annihilated, and Xiantao Town has been recovered. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Sihui: On the morning of the 7th, more than one hundred Japanese soldiers, accompanied by three cannons, advanced from Sanshui to harass Langang. Chinese troops bravely launched an attack, occupied the area north of Langang, and engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese troops. At that time, Chinese artillery at Mafang provided artillery support across the river, and several shells hit the Japanese positions, killing dozens of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated towards Mianyang in Sanshui. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Yicheng: More than a thousand Japanese infantry and cavalry went north this morning from Zhuangwangmiao between Zhongxiang and Daokou. Among them, more than a hundred people took three boats and tried to forcibly cross the Huangcheng Temple at the estuary of the Zhongxiang River. The Chinese defenders waited for their boats to reach the middle of the river and launched a fierce attack, sinking one boat immediately. The remaining two boats, seeing the situation was bad, fled back. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guangzhou Bay News: The situation on the Leizhou Peninsula is extremely tense. On the 4th and 5th, Leizhou City was bombed by Japanese aircraft, and Kangren Hospital and the library were bombed. Commerce has ceased, and most refugees have gone to Suixi. Japanese warships are gathered on the sea off Xuwen, planning to send troops to land. (8th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) After the Chinese troops withdrew from Zhongxiang, a part of the guerrillas remained in the city to engage in street fighting. It is said that after the Japanese troops entered the city, they were repeatedly attacked by Chinese troops and hit many landmines, causing a large number of casualties. The cost they paid was very high. The majority of the Chinese military strength west of the Pinghan Railway is about seventy divisions, totaling about 300,000 men, which is sufficient to prevent the Japanese army from advancing westward. It is also learned that a team of B troops, which had sneaked near Suixian County, was annihilated by the Chinese army. As a result, the threat to the left flank of the Chinese army has now been lifted. (8th news agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources in Guilin, three elite divisions of the Guangxi army have successively arrived in the southern part of Guangdong Province to reinforce. General Bai Chongxi, director of the Southwest Military Affairs Office, has appointed General Wei Yunsong to be responsible for commanding the southern route army and has sent more than ten senior staff officers to inspect the defenses in various parts of the southern route.

<p>(Hankou) According to news received here, due to continuous heavy rains in central Hubei, the river has flooded, and the inside and outside of Zhongxiang city have been completely flooded. The residents have already scattered. When the Japanese troops entered the city, it had almost become a dead city with no one in sight. (8th news agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a well-informed foreigner in Yichang, the Associated Press reported that the Japanese army has occupied Anlu, so the situation in Yichang is quite tense. It is impossible to speculate whether the Japanese army will cross the Hanshui River to attack or advance north to Xi'an. According to the Chinese military authorities, the Associated Press reported that the Chinese army is prepared to deal with the Japanese army's attack along the Pinghan Railway in Henan Province and the Longhai Railway in Henan Province. After occupying Anlu, the Japanese army's next target may be Xiangyang, and then advance from Xiangyang to Laohekou, because Laohekou is an important point for shipping on the Hanshui River.

<h3>More Than Forty Japanese Aircraft Bomb Yichang Madly All Day Long, More Than One Hundred Bombs Dropped, One-Third of the City's Houses Destroyed</h3>
<p>(Yichang) Today, from more than 8:00 in the morning to about 4:00 in the afternoon, more than forty Japanese aircraft dropped about one hundred bombs on the city. The bombed area accounted for about seven-tenths of the city, and more than one-third of the houses were destroyed. The number of casualties is under investigation. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Certain location: Japanese aircraft flew to Yichang three times on the 8th to bomb it. The first time was at 10:00 in the morning with eighteen planes, the second time was at 3:00 in the afternoon with nine planes, and the third time was at 4:00 in the afternoon with eighteen planes. Japanese aircraft indiscriminately bombed the urban area and fled. Many civilian houses in the city were destroyed, and many civilians were killed and injured. Details have not yet been reported.

<p>Changde: Six Japanese aircraft invaded the airspace over this city at 11:20 a.m. on the 8th and dropped more than twenty bombs in the Mamiao Bridge and Yinyang Bridge area outside the north gate. They went north through Anxiang and Huarong and fled. After investigation, the bombs dropped by the Japanese aircraft all landed in deserted suburbs and ponds. There was no major damage to residential houses. Only four farmers were killed and twelve men and women were injured. (8th dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army's Invasion and Plunder is Not a Fact</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to the official report obtained here, the rumor that the Japanese army has occupied Baoying is not a fact. Baoying is located in the northeast of Jiangsu Province and is easy to defend due to the dangers of Baoying Lake and the Grand Canal. It is also the seat of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Here yesterday, we also received a telegram from Han Deming, chairman of Jiangsu Province, reporting on the situation of the war against Japan. (8th news agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Purpose of Trade Control by the Puppet Organization is to Promote "United Notes", Foreign Interests Will Be Excluded, Britain Must Retaliate Against Japan</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A major businessman here met with a Reuters reporter and said that the hidden purpose of the new regulations on trade and foreign exchange control seems to be to force foreign banks to accept "United Reserve Notes" and to give the notes an exchange value that they do not currently have. The businessman added, "Although the Provisional Government claims that the legal tender is worthless from March 10, most of the legal tender is still circulating in the interior, so it is doubtful whether it will be greatly affected by this order. If foreign governments allow their nationals to agree to this new regulation, it is tantamount to allowing the 'Provisional Government' that they do not recognize to have the power to control North China's trade. The result will inevitably be that the foreign interests established over the years will be excluded. Manchuria can be taken as an example. Although the new regulations are issued in an attitude of seeking foreign cooperation, their ultimate goal is undoubtedly to benefit Japan and exclude foreign interests. The only way to remedy this now is for the British government to take appropriate retaliatory measures against Japanese trade." (8th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Expanding the Aid China Movement</h3>
<p>Since the United Kingdom and the United States implemented economic aid to China at the end of last year, they have established huge lines of credit for China. According to yesterday's report, the British government has decided to provide China with two more large loans. The first loan is £3 million, which will be used exclusively to consolidate China's legal tender system; the second loan is to expand the limits on export credit guarantees to China. The amount that has been drafted is £5 million, and its purpose is to purchase British transportation equipment and develop China's southwestern international transportation. At the same time, it is also reported that the new loan from the United States to China will also be signed and established. In addition, a friendly European country is also preparing to provide large-scale economic assistance to China. Judging from these news, the international aid China movement has become more and more active recently.</p>
<p>The situation in the Far East has now reached a very serious stage. It is also a very appropriate opportunity for the international community to step up its assistance to China. We see that Japan is blockading China's land and water transportation in the occupied areas of China, controlling China's commerce and finance, destroying all public and private industries of foreigners in China, and threatening the remaining spheres of influence of foreigners in China, the concessions. This is already well known. However, Japan's ambition of aggression is not satisfied with controlling the occupied areas in China and excluding foreign forces in China. Recently, when there was no way to deal with the war against China, it launched its so-called southward policy, preparing to extend its aggressive claws to other parts of the Far East outside of China. The White Army's landing on Hainan Island last month was a direct demonstration to French Indochina, and the bombing of the British Kowloon leased territory border was an even more obvious provocation to Britain. At the same time, Japan is also carrying out various coercive and tempting disruptive activities in other parts of the Far East. For example, in Burma, Japan sends a large number of monks, nuns, merchants, and students to carry out anti-British propaganda, trying to incite the Burmese people to rebel; for Portuguese Macau, because it could not obtain the Portuguese government's promise to supply the Japanese army, it even insulted and arrested the Portuguese consul in Hankou; for the Philippines' plan to block Taifu Port in order to consolidate national defense, Japan also made unreasonable protests on the grounds that it was detrimental to Japan; for the oil-rich Dutch East Indies, it is always coveting and seizing it. In short, Japan has regarded the entire Far East as something in her grasp, and she will never allow any European or American country to leave a trace of power in the Far East. This is the practice of the slogan "Asia for Asians" that Japan often shouts. We believe that in the near future, perhaps when her European comrades make colonial demands again, Japan will launch a large-scale war in Asia on the pretext of cutting off China's international transportation. Now, European and American countries that have relations with the Far East generally feel that it is urgent to find a way to defend themselves. Britain has built strong defensive fortifications in Singapore and Hong Kong, the Netherlands is also strengthening military equipment in the East Indies, and France is actively strengthening the army and air force in Vietnam to prevent violent invasion. However, these methods cannot prevent the aggressive forces from attacking. The only way to prevent the aggressive forces from attacking is to actively aid China.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the month, British Labour Party MP Lord Strabolgi gave a speech in the House of Lords, saying, "If we observe the situation with a long-term perspective, we will see that China is fighting for us." What a bold and insightful remark! Indeed, this war of resistance by China is not only fighting to safeguard its own national rights, but also fighting for the democratic system that the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries value in the same way, and also fighting to preserve the political and economic rights and interests of European and American countries in the Far East. Moreover, in the current situation in the Far East, only the victory of China's war of resistance can preserve the stability of the rights and interests of European and American countries in the Far East. Now, China's war of resistance is approaching its final victory, and friendly countries are urgently needed to provide assistance in military and economic aspects. All countries that have relations with the Far East should actively aid China for justice when this Sino-Japanese war is about to enter a decisive stage, and even more actively aid China to protect their own rights and interests in the Far East. British Sir Victor Sassoon recently returned to China and gave a public speech, advocating that Britain should actively aid China, which best shows the true views of those who have been in China for a long time and know the national conditions of China.</p>
<p>The international aid China movement does have a tendency to become more and more consistent. However, merely providing economic assistance to China can strengthen China's strength in the war of resistance, but it may not be able to force Japan to change its attempt to dominate the Pacific. If democratic countries want to resolutely curb the development of Japan's aggressive ambitions, they must go a step further, expand the scope of aid to China, and take economic sanctions against Japan from the opposite side, which will make it easier to end its war of aggression in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Women Commemorate March 8th; Soong Mei-ling Delivers a Speech; Striving to Enhance National Status; Considering Herself a Servant of the People; Bearing the Responsibility of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The 8th was the March 8th International Women's Day. The Women's Guidance Committee of the New Life Movement General Association called on all women's organizations in Chongqing, all girls' schools, and women from all walks of life to solemnly and enthusiastically commemorate the day. In the morning, anti-Japanese war films were shown free of charge in various cinemas, welcoming women to visit. In the afternoon, a Chongqing Women's Commemoration of March 8th Conference was held in the City Chamber of Commerce. Over 20,000 women attended. Chairman Zhang Ai-zhen briefly described the history and significance of International Women's Day. Afterwards, Ma Chao-jun, representative of the Central Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, followed by instructions from Madame Chiang. Amidst warm applause, Madame Chiang stood up and delivered her instructions. After her speech, the applause continued for several minutes. Subsequently, Ms. Powell from the International Women's Association in America, a representative from the Korean Women's Association, and Old Madam Zhang, a representative of the families of soldiers fighting the war, delivered speeches in succession. Representatives from various women's organizations, including Li Lan, Deng Yingchao, and Liu Hengjing, then delivered speeches on behalf of their respective organizations. Following this, they passed telegrams of greetings to women worldwide and to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and the soldiers at the front, as well as telegrams of condolences to the families of soldiers who had gone to war. Finally, they passed a declaration from the conference, shouted slogans, and adjourned the meeting. The atmosphere at the venue was enthusiastic. After the meeting, they formed a procession with torches, shouting slogans and singing anti-Japanese war songs along the way, with high spirits. The meeting dispersed around 9 o'clock. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The full text of Madame Chiang Soong Mei-ling's speech at the March 8th Commemoration Meeting is as follows: Fellow compatriots, today we are holding this meeting to commemorate March 8th. The decision to designate March 8th as International Women's Day was made at a meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1909. Today marks exactly 30 years since that decision, making it the 30th anniversary of March 8th. Today, when our Republic of China is facing enemy invasion and national hardship, as we simultaneously resist the war and build the nation, holding this important commemoration will undoubtedly bring special feelings to each of us. As you all know, the significance of March 8th lies in seeking women's liberation. However, so-called women's liberation is not just about achieving liberation; it requires the efforts of our female compatriots to enhance the status of our nation, allowing national life to be influenced by women, thereby raising its spiritual and material standards, and enabling the majority, or even all, of our compatriots to enjoy independence, freedom, equality, and happiness. We must recognize that women's liberation should not be seen merely as a right but as a responsibility. Why do we seek women's liberation? It is to fulfill our responsibilities as women. In other words, if we truly seek women's liberation, we must first be able to shoulder our responsibilities. Our Founding Father, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, gave a speech in 1924 with some very important words. He said, "The reason why the revolution has not succeeded is that individuals fight for freedom and forget the freedom of the nation. We must understand that if the nation has no freedom, individuals cannot have freedom." This is an absolutely true principle. When we talk about women's liberation today, we must also realize that if the nation is not liberated, women throughout the country cannot achieve true liberation. Today, our country is being bullied and invaded by the enemy, and the entire nation is under the heavy weight of violence, with compatriots displaced and suffering. If we do not first rescue this endangered nation, all 450 million of us will become slaves of a conquered nation. Where can we talk about women's liberation then? Who can we demand women's liberation from? I often say that women's liberation depends on our own efforts as women. If our knowledge and abilities as women continue to improve, and if we make tangible contributions to the nation and to humanity, women's status will naturally rise. Some people may think that women's participation in politics is the first step towards achieving women's liberation. This may be true. Modern countries cannot deny women the right to participate in politics. However, the true meaning of women's liberation is not merely about a few women gaining political and economic status; it is about alleviating the suffering of the majority of women and improving the lives of most of our female compatriots, starting with education and organization, to enhance women's abilities and raise their status. Moreover, practically speaking, it is not enough to talk only about women's liberation. We must also use the power of our women to achieve the liberation of the entire nation, only then will we have fulfilled our responsibility.</p>
<p>Many representatives of women's organizations are present today, including women from the intellectual sphere, women from the professional sphere, and women from the laboring sphere. Among the tens of thousands of female compatriots, we are considered relatively capable and have a certain status. Even if we cannot be called visionaries, we are at least above average. We must think about how we can live up to our own knowledge and abilities, how we can live up to the education and training we have received, and how we can be worthy of our nation and the era in which we live. Especially important, how should our many women's organizations contribute to the general public? Let me tell you a story. I remember when Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands was young, her father had already passed away. One day, on her tenth birthday, her mother held a celebration for her, and tens of thousands of men and women came to the palace to congratulate her. The young queen was overjoyed and deeply moved by this enthusiastic scene. She asked her mother, "Do these people belong to me?" Her mother said, "No, they do not belong to you, but you belong to them." I hope that the female compatriots present today will also recognize that we belong to the people, not the people to us. When we engage in any activity, we must not think that we can control the people, but rather consider ourselves servants of the people. We must approach the people, immerse ourselves among them, sincerely serve our compatriots, educate them, help them, relieve their suffering, and create their happiness. In this extraordinary period, the welfare of the nation and the people are united. If we cannot achieve victory in the War of Resistance, our nation will not survive. If our national reconstruction is not successful, none of us will have any happiness.</p>
<p>Today, our female compatriots must all assess the extent of their knowledge and abilities and determine the weight of their responsibilities. The greater one's knowledge and abilities, the heavier one's responsibilities. We must have passion, perseverance, methods, and, more importantly, organization to undertake various tasks related to the War of Resistance. We must promote thrift, encourage production, advance social education, preside over relief efforts, encourage joining the military to kill the enemy, and assist in the propaganda of the War of Resistance. Anything that benefits the War of Resistance and national reconstruction that men can undertake, we must also take on without hesitation. Especially important, and something that most women can do, I believe nothing surpasses comforting and assisting the families of soldiers who have gone to war. We must regularly comfort the families of soldiers at the front and the families of fallen soldiers, to give them spiritual comfort. We must also help them become self-reliant, such as by organizing handicrafts, organizing manual labor, teaching agricultural production techniques, and helping organize cooperatives, so that they do not experience economic and living difficulties. We must also help them solve the problem of their children's education. In this way, soldiers who have gone to war will have no worries about the home front, and the general public will enthusiastically respond to the call to join the army. If we have a smooth way to promote the conscription system, the War of Resistance will surely be victorious, and the nation will be guaranteed. I believe that with the spirit of our women, we will certainly be able to contribute greatly to the War of Resistance. Just look at the achievements of the women's donation day on Sunday, which can give us real confidence. Why can women's donations achieve such results? It is entirely because we are organized, united, and have a spirit of perseverance and hard work. Our women can mobilize uniformly, without distinguishing between each other, and contribute all of our strengths, whether large or small, to achieve such results. However, I believe that we have many tasks, and not every task needs to have obvious achievements on the surface. Our work is only initiated by our patriotic conscience and responsibility. We should not hope for boasting, praise, or encouragement, but bury ourselves in more realistic work. The more work that is not sought to be known, the greater the effect. We work hard and practically to be unsung heroes, not seeking personal honor, but seeking the honor of the nation and the people through collective efforts. In this way, we will surely be able to improve the status of our women and achieve our more lofty goals in practical work.</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots, this war of resistance is a war between justice and violence, a critical moment for the survival of the nation, and the prelude to the nation's revival. We should now ask nothing, care for nothing, and concentrate on winning the War of Resistance. We must know that justice and righteousness belong to us, and the sympathy of all mankind in the world belongs to us. Let me give a few examples to prove this. First, let me present to you a precious gift. It was taken from the body of an Indian woman. She said, "She has deep hatred for the brutality of the Japanese bandits, infinite sympathy for our Chinese War of Resistance, and is deeply moved by the efforts of our Chinese female compatriots in the War of Resistance. She has nothing to express, so she took off her only property, the ornament she always wears, and donated it to China." Please take a look, how much deep affection is entrusted in this string of loops. The second is that we received a letter from an American blind girl, with an attached gold yuan. She said in the letter that she was an unfortunate woman, but when she heard that China was being ravaged by the enemy so cruelly, and the suffering of Chinese boys and girls was so deep, she could understand the enemy's cruel behavior towards China and was not blind. She felt she should no longer complain about her misfortune, and expressed shame. She also expressed infinite excitement at the courage of Chinese female compatriots engaged in the War of Resistance. This letter and a gold yuan from thousands of miles away are truly moving. The third is that I received a letter from another foreign woman. She said that her fiancé and friends were killed while traveling, and she herself suffered from hemiplegia. However, driven by the concept of justice and humanity, she was very concerned about the Sino-Japanese War, reading newspapers every day and praying for China's victory. The doctor was afraid that she would be too stimulated and even forbade her to read the newspaper. She could not write letters herself, so she had to ask her friends to write them for her. This letter hoped that our Chinese compatriots could persevere and strive for final victory. You must know that I have received several letters from abroad every day recently. The above are just a few examples. We see that foreign friends thousands of miles away are still like this, how should we, daughters of the Chinese nation, encourage ourselves and spur ourselves to save our country and seek the liberation of our nation? With our own sacrifices and struggles, we can seek the liberation of the country and the true liberation of tens of thousands of female compatriots. I am very confident that we will be able to achieve our aspirations. I hope that the female compatriots present today will be determined, fight forward, and write the most glorious page in the history of the world women's movement. (8th dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Trial Flight Between Chongqing and Hami is Completed; Total Distance is 2,700 Kilometers; Flight Takes Two Days</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese officials today, the trial flight between Chongqing and Hami in Xinjiang has been completed. The distance between Chongqing and Hami is 2,700 kilometers, and the total flight time is set at two days. The aircraft used for this trial flight was a German three-engine Junkers "Ju 1" type. It is said that the Ministry of Communications has decided to use this type of aircraft for flights between Chongqing and Hami. The pilot for this trial flight was a Chinese pilot. It has also been decided to employ Chinese pilots in regular flights. Most of these pilots are graduates of the Chinese Army Aviation School. During their time at the school, they received rigorous training in the operation of various types of aircraft, so they are more than capable of being used as civil aviation pilots. According to the spokesperson, the reason why this Northwest airline had previously failed was purely due to the poor management of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications has decided to operate the route itself, with one round trip per week. It is expected to officially open within this month. If necessary, this route will be extended to Alma-Ata on the Turkestan-Siberia Railway in the Soviet Union, in order to establish direct contact with the Soviet Union. (7th United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Military Spokesman Discusses the Week's War Situation</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission discussed the week's war situation, stating that the situation in central Hubei and northern Jiangsu was relatively intense, while the various fronts in the north and south were also more active than last week. However, under the loyal and courageous resistance of all our officers and soldiers, the enemy's conspiracies and insidious plans have not succeeded. Their final struggles and inevitable destruction are enough to encourage us to continue our efforts and unleash an increasingly strong force. The week's war situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Guangdong Area: There have been no intense battles in the Guangzhou area and other regions this week. In addition to continuing to build fortifications and engage in stubborn defense at various key points, the enemy has also strengthened air defense facilities in various locations to guard against our air raids. They have also distributed leaflets, pictorials, cakes, and other items everywhere, attempting to deceive the public. However, they have been constantly resisted and attacked by our people. The enemy's plans have not succeeded. On the other hand, our troops in Huaxian launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops entrenched in Xinminpu on the morning of the 3rd. The Japanese troops fought in panic, and more than 200 were killed and scattered to Daling. The Chinese side captured Xinminpu. Another unit encountered a fierce battle with the Japanese troops in Lizhi'ao, between Huaxian and Conghua, on the 4th. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated, with more than 100 Japanese soldiers killed. On Hainan Island, in the south, Japanese troops in Haikou, Qiongshan, Chengmai, Ding'an, and Wenchang have been repeatedly attacked by various guerrilla units of the Chinese army, resulting in fierce battles and the deaths of more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers. At present, important strongholds such as a certain place between Chengmai are still in the hands of the Chinese army. The Japanese troops are only confined to the county towns and their vicinity and have become unable to move.</p>
<p>(2) Central Hubei Area: Since invading Yuekou last week, the Japanese troops entrenched in Tianmen have repeatedly attempted to cross the Xiang River with a large number of troops this week to invade Qianjiang. They were flanked by the defending troops on both sides of the Chinese side, and many Japanese soldiers were killed. They are currently still confronting the Japanese troops near Wamiaoji on the north bank of the river. The Japanese forces are exhausted and unable to attack again. The Japanese troops who invaded Zhongxiang along Pingba, Guanqiao, and Yanmenkou have seen the fighting intensify since the 2nd. The Chinese troops resisted step by step, and the Japanese suffered extremely heavy losses. By the morning of the 5th, the Japanese troops divided into three routes to launch a fierce attack. One route of 3,000-4,000 troops advanced along the Jingzhong Highway to the east of the county seat; another route of 3,000-4,000 troops advanced to the north of the county seat from Dongqiaozhen on the right side of the highway; and a third route of 2,000-3,000 troops advanced to the south of the county seat from Jiukou in the north, adopting a pincer formation. They fought a bloody battle with the Chinese troops in the Hangjiaji, Yangjiamiao, and Longjiadian areas. The Chinese officers and soldiers responded calmly, killing over 1,000 Japanese soldiers. By noon, the Japanese forces were greatly frustrated and suddenly released a large amount of highly toxic gas on the Chinese positions. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented in recent months. Although many Chinese officers and soldiers were poisoned, they were able to continue fighting after bandaging their wounds, killing countless more Japanese soldiers. The area has now entered a state of mixed warfare. More than 4,000 Japanese troops in the northwestern region of Hubei Province, after harassing Yujiadian last week, have engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese troops at Jiehe and Xindian this week. The Japanese troops have suffered hundreds of casualties, and their fierce offensive has been curbed. They are currently still in a stalemate with the Chinese troops near Yujiadian. To the east of Suixian, the war situation is currently stabilizing. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Spanish Civil War Nearing End, Britain Pays More Attention to the Far East, Cabinet to Discuss Economic Boycott Today, Japan Exhausted and Increasingly Anxious</h3>
<p>(Paris) The right-wing Parisian newspaper Le Figaro recently published a dispatch from its London correspondent stating: "With the Spanish problem nearing its end, British political figures are gradually finding relief and are therefore able to pay increasing attention to the Far East problem. When the cabinet meets tomorrow, it will discuss the Far East situation. Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax are expected to make great efforts in the short term to end the Sino-Japanese War. Regardless of the impact on humanitarian and political considerations, the continuation of the Sino-Japanese War poses a risk of bankruptcy to British commercial interests in the Far East, which cannot be ignored. Furthermore, British naval bases in the Far East are under threat from Japan, and this development cannot be tolerated. Therefore, it is inevitable that the British government will adopt a firm attitude toward Japan."</p>
<p>The right-wing newspaper Le Figaro also published a dispatch from its London correspondent stating: "After the improvement of the situation in the Mediterranean, the British government can shift its focus to the Far East problem. It will soon lend China three to five million pounds and, at the same time, take economic measures in conjunction with the U.S. government to deal with Japan. Economic means, when used at the appropriate time, are the most effective weapon. Japan has been at war for nearly two years and is exhausted. Therefore, its fear of economic pressure from Britain and the United States is even greater than it was two years ago. Its territorial ambitions may therefore be somewhat restrained, which is not impossible." (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry ordered that the prices of thirteen types of goods should not exceed the market prices before March 4th, friction between the Japanese government and merchants has become even more tense. The commodities affected by this price restriction order include cotton, sugar, nails, coffee, and zinc. Regarding the price of silk fabrics, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry stipulates that it should not exceed the market price on January 10th. Japanese silk merchants are extremely dissatisfied with this government restriction, and in fact, the price of silk fabrics has increased by 40% to 50% since January 10th. The Japanese government believes that such soaring prices are excessive. Since the government intervened, the price of raw silk weighing one hundred pounds has increased by 1,000 yen per bale, hovering around 975 yen per bale after the government's restriction order.

<p>(Tokyo) During the discussion of the budget案 in the Lower House this morning, a member of parliament questioned the supply of arms and ammunition to the Chinese government by foreign countries after Japan occupied Hainan Island. Minister of War Itagaki replied that most of the military supplies entering China via French Vietnam were transported by rail, while those passing through Burma were transported along the river by French ships. The transportation of heavy armaments did not pass through Burma or Vietnam. Aircraft and other war materials were currently being supplied to China by the Soviet Union. When asked whether the special military expenditure budget for the "China Incident" meant that the combat area would not expand, Itagaki replied that Japan had already established a policy for the "China Incident" and would not disclose future war plans. Subsequently, when asked about the necessity of using diplomatic methods, Itagaki replied that it was regrettable that foreign countries did not understand the "New Situation in East Asia."

<h3>Madrid: Communist Uprising Fails, Overnight Street Fighting Has Ended, Peace Agreement May Be Concluded in Two Weeks</h3>
<p>Madrid: The Communist Party launched an uprising last night against the National Defense Committee, leading to street fighting in the city that lasted all night until this afternoon when it was quelled. The National Defense Committee mobilized a large army, using tanks and aircraft to assist in suppressing the rebellion. The situation was serious, as can be seen. Communist Party members in the suburbs continued to exchange fire with government troops this morning for three hours, until they were defeated by the government troops' tanks. Some party members in the city refused to surrender, hiding in civilian houses and firing on the streets. At 2:30 PM, an air raid alert was heard. Aircraft dispatched by the National Defense Committee bombed civilian houses where the Communists were resisting. Soon after, the Communist Party members surrendered, and the gunfire ceased. Order was restored, but soldiers remained stationed in major buildings, and the army patrolled the streets. Premier Miaja personally inspected the city on foot in the afternoon, and the people cheered for him. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>Establishing a Guerrilla Command Post on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Line, Recruiting Unreformed Units, Japanese Troops Repeatedly Defeated in Qingpu</h3>
<p>In order to coordinate with the second phase of the War of Resistance and support the front lines, Gu Zhutong, commander of the 3rd War Area, has strengthened the organization of civilian armed forces in the guerrilla areas of southern Jiangsu and established the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Guerrilla Command Post in the area along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Line. From now on, the guerrilla units in the above-mentioned area will be under the command of this command post to facilitate unified command. It is expected that there will be new developments soon.</p>
<h3>Recruiting Various Units</h3>
<p>In the guerrilla areas, young people who automatically pledge allegiance to the country are very enthusiastic. Therefore, there are still many units that have not been reorganized by the National Government. The National Government has specially telegraphed various provinces and cities to extensively recruit and dispatch a certain Zhan to organize the unreformed units in the guerrilla areas. It is reported that after receiving the order from the Central Government, Zhan has dispatched certain Zhou and certain Xu to Caohe, Beixinjing, Zhenru, Kunshan, Suzhou, Changzhou, and the area along Taihu Lake to reorganize the unreformed units. Zhan has already appointed Xu as the deputy detachment commander of the 9th Detachment of the Mobile Corps in the Zhenru area. It is expected that there will soon be a well-organized and sound unit organization in the guerrilla area.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle in Zhangyan</h3>
<p>According to people from Qingpu, since the Japanese troops stationed in the city, instigated by the puppet "Magistrate" Yao Miaoling, launched a large-scale attack on the guerrilla unit of Yuan in Tianma Mountain on the 1st of this month and failed, they have retreated to the city and tightly closed the city gates, only opening a north gate for passage, and preventing the guerrillas from attacking the city. The situation is extremely tense. Recently, in order to open up the transportation line to Huangdu, which is 30 li away, and obtain assistance from the Japanese troops in Huangzhen, they dispatched 40 to 50 Japanese soldiers on several motorboats at noon on the 4th to probe northward along the river. However, the guerrilla unit of Wei, stationed in Zhangyan Town, 17 to 18 li away from the north city, learned of this and believed that the opportunity had arrived. They quickly dispatched hundreds of soldiers to intercept and surround them outside the town. The Japanese soldiers abandoned their boats and landed to resist. The Chinese army used its dual advantage in numbers and geography to inflict heavy blows on the 50 Japanese soldiers, killing or wounding more than half of them. They hurriedly returned to their boats and fled back to Qingcheng. Two hours later, the Japanese army launched a new attack on Zhangyan from Qingpu, Huangdu, Xujing, Baihegang, and other four routes. The Wei unit was unwilling to show weakness and immediately opened fire. The sound of gunfire and artillery fire intertwined. After two hours of fierce fighting, they completed their attrition strategy and temporarily withdrew to prepare for another attack in the evening. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army completely retreated when the sky was about to darken. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered many more casualties, and several guerrillas also sacrificed their lives.</p>
<h3>Jieyang Investigates and Eradicates Opium Seedlings, County Magistrate Strictly Prohibits Extortion</h3>
<p>A correspondent from Shantou reports that Jieyang County is the most prosperous area in eastern Guangdong in terms of agricultural products, with more than 1.5 million mu of arable land, producing enough rice and cane sugar annually to feed its 700,000+ residents with a surplus. In previous years, local sugar sales in the north were valued at over one million silver dollars, representing the largest export of local products in the Chaoshan region. Last year, the new-style sugar factory in Qu River was bombed, and the villages continued to use the old method of producing local sugar, transporting it by land to inland areas in Fujian and Jiangxi. However, due to excessive transportation costs, prices fell, making sugar cane farmers unprofitable. They switched to planting peculiar flowers. These flowers are shaped like inverted bells, currently blooming in abundance in the fields, with red, white, and purple colors interspersed, stretching as far as the eye can see. Farmers dare not plant them openly along roadsides and in areas with high pedestrian traffic. They are particularly lush in the remote mountainous areas of the second and fifth districts. Successive county governments have issued announcements prohibiting opium seedlings, but these peculiar flowers seem to have no connection with the announcements, having become a well-known open secret. In February of last year, a certain Xie in Tatou Township clashed with the county government's guards over tax collection, resulting in several deaths. The matter was eventually resolved through an ambiguous method. Chen, the county magistrate of Jieyang, took office in February and heard that opium seedlings were blooming and bearing fruit in villages from Mianhu to Hepo. He issued an official document ordering the police chiefs of the relevant districts to convene meetings of the heads of villages and baojia, demanding that each village chief clear the seedlings within five days and not wait and see. However, the villages did not comply. On February 26th, he dispatched a squadron of administrative police, along with the second squadron of the standing volunteer corps, to the villages of Mianhu and Hepo to supervise the villagers in eradicating the opium. Before the team departed, Magistrate Chen personally instructed all officers and soldiers not to use the name of opium eradication to extort a single cent from the villages or accept petty bribes such as tea or wine money. Once discovered, they would be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Guangdong's Northwest River Front Consolidated, Japanese Army Attempts to Control the East River, Chinese Side's New Deployment Completed</h3>
<p>A correspondent from Guangzhou reports that since the invading Japanese army shifted its direction and devoted all its efforts to attacking Hainan Island, the military situation in the various war zones near Guangzhou has been fluctuating. Most of the Japanese troops in the West River seemed to have been transferred to attack Hainan. Therefore, the situation above Jiujiang and Sanshui was gradually easing last month. Only 2,000 Japanese troops remained in the Sanshui River Estuary and the Southwest area. Their outposts advanced to Muxianlanggang, actively setting up defensive fortifications during the day and retreating to the Sanshui River Estuary to camp at night, knowing that their forces were weak and preventing night attacks by the Chinese guerrillas. On the Jiujiang side, the Japanese army also retreated one after another, and a part was transferred to the East River. After the Japanese infantry retreated on the 26th and 27th of last month, newly arrived Taiwanese reserve troops were transferred to fill the defense, with a strength of only 400 to 500 people. However, the defensive fortifications were more consolidated than before, with trenches dug near the defense area and machine guns and small steel cannons erected. As for the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Longshan and Longjiang in Shunde, it was purely to avoid attacks by the Chinese air force, and they have now retreated to the Foshan area, relying on the air defense infantry to cover them.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Jiangxi in a Dilemma</h3>
<p>The Chinese army in the West River believes that the Japanese army is paying attention to the military affairs of the East River, considering it an opportunity to launch a counterattack. Recently, the troops of Guangdong and Guangxi in the West River have been redeployed, and the direction of the attack has been divided. The Deng Longguang troops in Guangdong Province have already arrived in the vicinity of Gaoyao. All of the original tax police corps of the Japanese will be under the command of Deng. The Guangxi army on the southwest bank will be led by Xia Wei. Both sides have made full preparations for the counterattack, and Deng and Xia have also met to decide on various liaison matters. Deng personally went to the front lines of Heshan, Heqing, and Haikou a few days ago to inspect the defense. Before the counterattack, the Chinese army repeatedly dispatched aircraft to bomb the rear of the Japanese army in the West River, destroying their defensive fortifications. At the end of last month, it once flew to Jiujiang and dropped seven or eight bombs on the Japanese military camp at Dagang and the Japanese military base at Bo'ai Station. The Japanese military camp and the Japanese artillery positions at Heqing were all hit by bombs, resulting in heavy losses. The position of the Japanese army in the West River has recently changed from active to passive, and they are in a dilemma.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Boluo Consolidates Defense Line</h3>
<p>Judging from the overall war situation of the Japanese army, its movements seem to be to launch a surprise attack on the Chinese army in the East River, containing the Chinese army in the northwest river, so that the Japanese army in Hainan can find an opportunity to take advantage of the situation and invade Leizhou or Qinlian. Therefore, the military situation in Longmen and Heyuan in the East River and the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong has become slightly tense recently. Over the past week, the Japanese army in Zengcheng has invaded in two routes. One route advanced along Zhengguo Wutu to Longmen. The Japanese army in Shiqiao, Zhucun, and other places below Zengcheng has increased to more than 2,000 people, with one squadron of cavalry and one platoon of artillery. They invaded the Chinese army in Shangxia Nanhua. After suffering a setback once, they did not dare to advance further, because if they went deeper, they would be intercepted by the Chinese army in the North River. Therefore, most of the Japanese army traveled along the Zengcheng Shitan Road to spy on Boluo and Heyuan. On the 26th of last month, they advanced to Shima and fought fiercely with the Wu Qiwu troops of the Chinese army for a day and night, and used aircraft and artillery to bombard the positions of the Chinese army. The Wu troops then moved to a new position and firmly defended Sucun to defend Boluo. The Japanese army is currently blocked in Sucun and has not been able to leave Futian, because the Chinese army near Boluo has strong fortifications, and the Wu troops are also a long-fought army. It is not easy for the Japanese army to advance further without paying a heavy price.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Attempts to Protect Sea Outlets</h3>
<p>In the past ten days, the Guangzhou Japanese army has abandoned the west and moved east. There are two reasons for this. From an active perspective, the Japanese army has increased its troops to the East River, bombing Boluo, Heyuan, Longchuan, and Laolong, with the purpose of capturing Yunling, leaving Lianping, controlling the upper reaches of the East River, and further attempting to cut off the transportation routes between Fujian and Guangdong and Jiangxi and Guangdong. Therefore, Japanese warships have been hovering on the sea off Shantou and Chenghai, seemingly remotely supporting the land army invading the east. However, in reality, the East River is still easy for the Japanese army to operate along the coastline. As for the Heyuan and Xingning areas, the mountains are stacked, and it is difficult to march. Except for the air force, it is difficult for the mechanized units of the Japanese army to exert their power. Moreover, the elite troops of the Chinese side are stationed in the upper reaches of the East River, waiting for work at ease. If the Japanese army advances rashly, it will commit a great danger. From a passive perspective, the Japanese army's sudden invasion of the east is actually taking an offensive defense, because the new deployment of the Chinese army in the East River has been completed in the past month. The Japanese army in the East District is confined to Dongguan and Zengcheng, preventing the East River from being attacked by the Chinese army. Therefore, before the Chinese army launched a large-scale counterattack, it took the initiative to strike first and wanted to defeat the main force of the Chinese army, Wu Qiwu's troops, in the East River. Therefore, there was a fierce battle in Shijiao. Secondly, the Japanese army has been withdrawing from the West River from all sources, fearing that the Chinese army in the East River would intercept and encircle them. Therefore, they expanded their forward line in the East River to protect their sea outlet, Humen. If the Japanese army that recently attacked Boluo does not advance further, then the battle of Shijiao was purely for the latter.</p>
<h3>Jian Dao Bible Institute Relocates, Shot at During the Process, Mrs. Lin Unfortunate Victim</h3>
<p>A correspondent from Guangxi's "New Voice" reports that the Jian Dao Bible Institute in Wuzhou, Guangxi, was founded by the Western Missionary Alliance to train young men and women preachers. Since hiring Mr. Lin Daoliang, a preacher from the Shanghai Jubilee Church, as the director of the institute, the institute's work has developed, and the number of students has also increased day by day. Recently, Wuzhou is the throat of Guangxi, located in a dangerous place. On the 15th of last month, the institute received an order from the government to relocate the institute to Longzhou. Unexpectedly, on the morning of January 16th, the teachers and students of the Jian Dao Institute were relocating when they saw Japanese planes flying in from the southwest. Although the English flag was hung high on the small steamship, the Japanese airmen still flew low and fired at the small steamship. Many students were injured, fortunately, the injuries were still light. Unfortunately, Ms. Jin Jufang, the wife of Lin Daoliang, was wounded in the abdomen by bullets, and also injured the four-month-old baby she was carrying, bleeding non-stop. After arriving at the hospital, she immediately died of exhaustion. It can be said to be tragic.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices Soar in Zhejiang Province, Provincial Government Encourages Procurement of Jiangxi Rice</h3>
<p>A correspondent from Jinhua reports that eastern Zhejiang has many mountains and few fields, and has always been a rice-deficient area. This year, due to a sharp increase in population, the supply of food cannot meet the demand, resulting in soaring rice prices in various counties. The provincial government has encouraged merchants to obtain licenses and go to Jiangxi to purchase food rice in order to provide a continuous supply and avoid a shortage of food. According to an investigation by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the railway transported 17,188 tons of rice to Zhejiang in January and 11,014 tons of rice to Zhejiang from February 1st to 23rd. It is estimated that there are about 15,000 tons of rice waiting to be transported in Jiangxi. In total, the amount of rice transported from Jiangxi to Zhejiang in January and February is about 30,000 tons, equivalent to about 60 million catties, a total of 600,000 dan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Automobile Attacked in Baimao Estuary</h3>
<p>A correspondent from Taicang reports that Baimao Estuary in northern Taicang, bordering Changshu, is located on the riverside and is a strategic location. A few days ago, two trucks of the Datong Automobile Company, loaded with military supplies, were learned of by the Wu Guorong unit of the Liuh River Guerrilla Force, who led their team to launch a surprise attack. The truck bodies were damaged by bullets, and the two Japanese escorts were captured alive. The military supplies used were also detained. Subsequently, a large truck full of tinfoil, driven by a Russian, was ordered to stop by the guerrillas. The Russian did not understand Chinese and drove forward, and was hit by a volley of gunfire. The cylinder was hit by a bullet and caught fire. All the tinfoil in the car was completely burned, with losses amounting to 30,000 yuan. The Russian driver was also wounded by bullets.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Attacking Cangshu, Suffered a Crushing Defeat</h3>
<p>A correspondent from Banhu reports that the Shen and Luo units of the Chinese army, together with the people's self-defense force, led by County Magistrate Zhang Gefei, besieged the Pinghu County City. After eight days of stalemate, the Japanese troops besieged in Niuhu tightly closed the city, and steel cannons were densely arranged on the city walls, blindly bombarding outside the city. The Chinese army was not damaged, but the civilian houses outside the city were destroyed by Japanese artillery fire. The headquarters of the Chinese army was located in Xincang Town. A grand memorial service was held there on the 3rd to mourn the four patriots who bravely sacrificed their lives in the siege. Jin, the Japanese army, planned to take advantage of the Chinese army's unpreparedness and set off in a large team, detouring Xindai in an attempt to directly attack Xincang. Unexpectedly, they got lost. In Fangtu Town, north of Xindai, there were more than 300 guerrillas of the Jin unit, who suddenly surrounded the Japanese army. After three hours of fierce fighting, about 300 shops in Fangtu Town were set on fire by the Japanese army in the east and west markets. All the houses were turned into ashes, and dozens of innocent people were also surrounded by the flames and buried in the fire pit. Seeing that the guerrillas were numerous and loud, the Japanese army did not dare to love the war and fled to Jinshan.</p>

<h3>Education News: Guangxi Province Vigorously Implements General People's Education, Adopts the Anti-Japanese Three-Character Classic as a Teaching Material, Prints Three Million Copies to Promote Propaganda</h3>
<p>Wang Xiangchen, deputy director of the Popular Reading Materials Group of the Teaching Materials Editing Committee of the Ministry of Education, has been working hard on the production of popular literature and art for many years. The Anti-Japanese Three-Character Classic he wrote has been very effective in arousing the anti-Japanese sentiments of the people. In addition to Wang printing 200,000 copies at his own expense to promote propaganda, the book has also been listed as one of the wartime popular series of the Ministry of Education. Wang recently received a telegram from the Guangxi Provincial Government stating that the province is vigorously implementing general wartime adult education and plans to adopt the Anti-Japanese Three-Character Classic as a teaching material, printing 3 million copies, and soliciting his consent. Wang immediately replied by telegram, willing to sacrifice his copyright and hoping to print as many copies as possible.</p>
<h3>Proposal from Shanghai Education Professors at the National Education Conference (3)</h3>
<p>Please set up an education design agency and extensively solicit the entire strategy for education and nation-building, select experts, carefully study, and report to the central government within a time limit for adoption and implementation.</p>
<p>(Reason) During the period when the imperial examination was abolished in our country, during the Xinhai Revolution, and during the establishment of the National Government, society has undergone drastic changes, but the overall education seems to lack a planned transformation.</p>
<p>Education is a sharp weapon for resisting Japan and building the country. Resisting Japan and building the country requires all the people of the country to have a clear awareness, a determination to persevere, consistent action, and lasting strength. All of these cannot be achieved without education, so education must be rapidly transformed.</p>
<p>However, the transformation of education must start from the root. Such as emphasizing practice over theory, such as reducing vacations and shortening hands, such as revising curriculum standards, such as increasing or decreasing the duration of schools at all levels, such as teaching focusing on practice, such as training using mentors, it seems that these are still branch problems. The transformation must also have a comprehensive plan, such as restricting studying abroad, such as making good use of the Geng funds, such as ensuring education funds, such as increasing teachers' salaries, such as implementing joint examinations, such as centrally awarding degrees, such as central appointment of professors, such as improving the university course selection system, such as banning one or two bad private schools, such as expanding vocational schools, paying attention to technical training, it seems that these are still partial solutions, but to thoroughly transform education, on the one hand, we should cut off corruption, which is indeed not a means of transformation, on the other hand, we should be based on the latest education theory, the recent national conditions and the world education trends, earnestly study, and formulate an entire strategy, in order to build a new education for the country, lead the whole people, resist Japan and build the country. For example, how to establish a new Chinese education ideological system, how to determine the education goals of each stage according to our country's education goals, and then according to the education goals of each stage, further implement the minimum curriculum standards, so that education can be thoroughly Three People's Principles, how to control national education, whether in the distribution and supervision of education fees, the establishment of private schools, and the adjustment of other social or cultural institutions, so that education can fully exert its national function and penetrate into the lives of the whole people, how to establish a central normal college, specializing in research and experimentation, concentrating on teacher training, and cooperating with normal colleges in various regions, so that education theory can be further developed, and teachers can be more professional, how to concentrate the power of appointment of teachers and education administrators, and ensure their minimum living standards, how to unify and simplify the national education administration, reform the inspection system, how to organize national children and youth, not only to combine teaching and training, but also to completely integrate education with the party and government, how to add national institutions, specializing in editing and reviewing textbooks, scripts, and broadcasting scripts, and coordinating school building construction, supplying education materials, and trial-producing teaching aids, how to create simple characters, unify the national language within a time limit, and eliminate illiteracy, etc., all require comprehensive deliberation and implementation step by step, so that the general education colleagues can follow and complete the great cause of nation-building.</p>
<p>(Methods) Designate funds, hire education experts, and organize an education design agency attached to the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Solicit the entire strategy for education and nation-building. Organize and sort out the solicited plans within a time limit, and report to the central government for adoption.</p>
<p>Examine the implementation results and continue to research, investigate, design, and improve.</p>
<p>In particular, for the relief of out-of-school children and unemployed teachers, please the central government allocate a portion of the compulsory education, social education, or wartime relief funds, and issue an order to all schools and education institutions in the country to jointly promote street children education.</p>
<p>(Reason) Since the August 13th Incident, children have dropped out of school everywhere, and teachers have been unemployed. Especially in large cities such as the Shanghai Concession, there are no less than 100,000 street children. There are also many elementary school teachers who are entrusted to refugee shelters. For the country and for humanity, we cannot stand by and ignore them.</p>
<p>Whether in the economic, administrative, school building, or teaching aspects, the general elementary schools are not suitable for resisting Japan. It is not only increasing social waste to force children to decorate Taigu with education that is not suitable for resisting Japan, but it is actually reducing the national power to resist Japan.</p>
<p>Since the war of resistance, the education community has neither sought fundamental transformation nor concentrated its efforts on cooperative relief, contradicting and hesitating. There should be a rapid and positive setting up to promote the war of resistance and education at the same time.</p>

<p>Young Woman Sues for Alimony  After Living with Wang Muliang for Several Years  Abandoned After Bearing a Daughter  Wang Muliang, age 33, a shareholder of the Tongxing Steamship Company and a native of Huizhou, Anhui Province, resides at No. 28, Yiyeli, Galle Road, Rue Laguénée, in the French Concession.  He originally had a wife, Ms. Xu, but in 1933, he met Tao Guixian, a woman from Changshu (age 22 this year), and lived together, bearing a daughter.  Recently, Wang's feelings for Ms. Tao cooled, and he abandoned her.  Therefore, Tao Guixian retained lawyer Xiao Baichuan to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Wang Muliang of abandonment and attaching a civil suit.  According to the complaint, the plaintiff met the defendant in 1933 and was seduced.  They began living together in 1934, renting residences at No. 39, Yinyuli, Baxianqiao, and No. 6, Yonganli, Rue Wagner.  On December 20, 1936, a daughter was born.  The defendant asked Dr. Xi from Zhongde Hospital to deliver the baby. The girl was named Genling and is now three years old.  Initially, the defendant concealed the fact that he already had a wife, Ms. Xu.  After the plaintiff found out, it was too late.  She had to endure it.  However, the defendant treated the plaintiff fairly well until Ms. Xu came to make trouble starting in February of last year.  Afterward, the defendant gradually became distant from the plaintiff.  Starting in July, he stopped paying living expenses.  On December 13 of last year, the defendant's wife, Ms. Xu, brought a group of men and women who beat and insulted the plaintiff and took away all her clothes and belongings.  Having no choice, the plaintiff temporarily stayed with a friend.  Since then, the defendant has abandoned the plaintiff.  Now, the plaintiff is pregnant and about to give birth.  Without sufficient funds and a place to live, the situation is precarious.  She has no choice but to sue for an investigation and request an order to pay 3,000 yuan in living expenses.  Based on the complaint, the court once held a hearing to summon the defendant.  Because the defendant did not appear, the hearing was postponed.  Yesterday, Magistrate Zhang Minsheng held a hearing.  The plaintiff and her lawyer appeared.  The defendant's defense lawyer, Mao Xianshen, appeared.  After questioning both parties, the court decided to postpone the hearing for further investigation.  The defendant provided a guarantor to ensure his appearance when summoned.</p>
<p>Dismissed Chauffeur Steals Car Out of Resentment and Vents Spite  Sentenced to Forty Days of Detention</p>
<p>Mr. Aeliaas, a Westerner residing at No. 400, Haig Road in West Shanghai, owns a car worth 3,000 yuan, license plate number 10101.  On the 5th of this month, at 5 p.m., after finishing work in his office, he drove home and parked the car in the garage.  An hour later, his chauffeur suddenly discovered that the car was missing.  Initially, he thought the owner had driven it out.  However, upon going to the upper floor and seeing the owner in the room, he knew the car must have been stolen.  He immediately inquired with the gatekeeper, who said he had seen someone driving the car rapidly south on Rue Say Zoong.  Mr. Aeliaas immediately telegraphed the Jing'an Temple Police Station to notify all police stations to investigate.  On the night of the 7th, at 8 p.m., the car was found near the intersection of Avenue Road and Rue de Warend.  The French police station, upon receiving the report, notified the Jing'an Temple Police Station to send a detective and the owner to identify the car.  It was confirmed to be the original car.  However, upon inspecting the entire car, the gasoline tank cap and another part were missing.  The rest was intact.  The motive of the thief is unknown and is subject to conjecture.  After careful investigation by Chinese and Western detectives, Zhao Miaogen, a local, a recently dismissed chauffeur of a German friend of the owner, was suspected.  He was immediately arrested and confessed under interrogation.  Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court.  Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted Zhao according to the law, stating the facts of the case and requesting a trial.  Magistrate Dai Rongduo conducted the interrogation.  Zhao confessed that he stole the car purely to vent his anger.  He had been dismissed by his employer for lending the employer's car to the plaintiff for three days, which led to his dismissal.  He was filled with resentment and stole the car and abandoned it.  He also admitted to damaging the gasoline tank cap and discarding it, but denied damaging anything else.  After hearing the case, the court immediately announced the verdict: Zhao Miaogen was sentenced to 40 days of detention.  If he converts it to a fine, it would be two yuan per day.  The defendant expressed his acceptance of the sentence in court and was immediately taken into custody.</p>
<p>Woman Dies from Abortion  Female Doctor Zhu Wenfang Sent to Court for Trial</p>
<p>Ms. Liu Xu, a married woman from Wuxi (age 33), residing at No. 94, Dagu Road, whose husband, Liu Qingxiang, works in a certain place and does not earn much.  She has five children, boys and girls.  Ms. Liu recently became pregnant again, about two months along.  She felt burdened by having too many children and secretly went to the Wenfang Obstetrics Hospital at No. 18, Lane 713, Rue Gordon, founded by Zhu Wenfang (age 40), a woman from Hubei, on the 2nd of this month. She wanted to have an abortion.  Zhu Wenfang asked for 15 yuan, which Ms. Liu agreed to pay.  Zhu provided her with a bottle of pills, twelve in total, and a piece of gauze soaked in medicine, instructing Ms. Liu to take the pills and insert the gauze into her vagina to induce an abortion.  Ms. Liu took the pills and gauze home and followed the instructions.  However, after two days and nights, the fetus did not abort.  She went to Zhu Wenfang's place again and took four more pills, which were still ineffective.  On the evening of the 6th, at 10:30 p.m., Ms. Liu's face turned pale, and her condition deteriorated significantly.  Her husband, Liu Qingxiang, hired a car to take her to Zhongde Hospital on Avenue Foch.  She died at the hospital at 10:40 a.m. the next morning.  Liu Qingxiang reported the incident to the Gordon Road Police Station.  Detectives Zhu Mengqi and Xia Shutang rushed to arrest Zhu Wenfang and brought her and the pills and gauze back to the police station. Zhu Wenfang was transferred to the women's prison.  Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Criminal Division 3 of the First Special Court.  Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and requested that Zhu be detained, stating that Liu Xu's body had been sent to the morgue for an autopsy and requesting a postponement.  He presented the pills and gauze as evidence.  Liu Qingxiang stated that his wife had gone to the obstetrics hospital for an abortion, but he was unaware of it at the time and only found out the next day.  Zhu Wenfang's testimony was evasive.  Magistrate Jiang Shuzi ordered that she be remanded in custody and the hearing postponed for seven days.</p>

<p>A certain Vietnamese police officer, No. 142, from the Avenue Joffre Police Station in the French Concession, who had been working for many years, lived with his family in Room 2, Company Housing, behind the Avenue Joffre Police Station.  Recently, for some unknown reason, he had a sudden impulse and took his own life.  At 7:30 p.m. on the 7th, in his room, he pointed his duty rifle at his throat, pressed the trigger with his right big toe, and fired.  The bullet entered through his throat, pierced his brain, and exited through the top of his head.  Brain matter and blood splattered everywhere.  His family heard the noise and immediately sent him to the hospital, but it was too late to save him.  After the authorities of the French Concession sent personnel to the scene to examine the body yesterday, the family prepared the body for burial.</p>

<p>Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation Weekly  Housing Special Page  Chairman Chiang's Residence  Water Bird</p>
<p>People filled with feudal ideas generally believe that Chairman Chiang's residence must be magnificent and like a palace. In fact, he lives in this era, bearing enormous and arduous responsibilities. He is rarely in one place for long, so he does not have the leisurely enjoyment that people imagine. He constantly inspects various places and goes to the front lines during wartime. In such an unstable life, he cannot hide in an ivory tower to pursue the beauty of his residence. He often borrows other people's residences as temporary quarters. For example, when he was in Hankou, he borrowed Yang Sen's mansion in Yihua Village outside Hankou; when he was in Chengdu, he borrowed Liu Wenhui's mansion; and in Nanjing, his residence in his hometown also used old buildings with slight modifications. In Linchuan (Fuzhou), Jiangxi, for the convenience of long-term encirclement and suppression of the Red Army, he built a square, large flat house on the west end of an empty field in Linchuan Middle School. The form of this house is slightly different from ordinary houses, with square corners and very high. There are many windows, and each room is connected. It is said that Chairman Chiang designed it himself. He said that after the war, it could be assigned to the middle school for use. I don't know if it is still intact now. The furnishings inside are also very simple. In the bedroom, two beds are placed side by side, and several commemorative photos and couplets of Chairman Chiang and his wife are hung on the surrounding walls. The bedroom is slightly elevated, and the next room is the bathroom. In his office, the writing desk is very large, and the file cabinets behind it have each drawer marked with the type of item. This is a good place for thinking. The middle of the house is the reception room, and detailed military maps are hung on the two walls. These furnishings are the same in Chairman Chiang's residences everywhere. Only in his hometown of Xikou, in the residence converted from Wenchang Pavilion, there are many more commemorative photos. Upon entering the gate, you can see an enlarged photo of Chairman Chiang standing beside Madam Wang. In the Nanjing residence, there is also a carpet embroidered with a map of the Republic of China, which is placed in the large living room. It is very novel and precious and has a profound meaning!</p>
<p>Records of Village Life  Sorrowful Departure  Ai Li</p>
<p>After the success of the Xinhai Revolution, I returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou with my husband, Liu San, and lived in seclusion in the countryside, growing vegetables behind closed doors. Sometimes I grew orchids and planted chrysanthemums. My late father loved chrysanthemums, my husband loved orchids, and I loved monthly roses. Every morning after breakfast, we would enter the small garden together to tend to the flowers. Cymbidium orchids prefer sunlight. If the weather is sunny and the sunlight is not strong, we would move the potted plants to a sunny place for a while. The soil must be moist but not dry for the flowers to flourish. The seven-petal variety, with petals resembling plums and lotus flowers, is the best. The variety with white petals and a wrapped heart is a special variety, followed by the pure-hearted variety. Others are not worth mentioning. When the flowers bloom, I inhale their fragrance, as if encountering a recluse in a long-deserted empty mountain. Although we are speechless, we forget ourselves. My husband said that wine can make people distant, and so can this flower. Monthly roses are a famous product of Yangzhou. I bought them at a high price. There are three colors: light red, tender yellow, and white. I love their bright colors and strong fragrance. I am content to be with them all day long. The fragrance of this flower is quite strong, so Shanghai people call it the "perfume flower." However, it does not live long. Although I take great care of it, it gradually withered after three years. I regret it very much, probably because the soil is not good. There are many types of chrysanthemums, too numerous to list. The green lotus, golden belt, and jade belt are also top-grade. In the spring, we pick the tender shoots and plant them in chrysanthemum beds. After they take root, we transplant them into pots. In the autumn, we must remove the side branches and flower buds to make the flowers large and beautiful. I remember at that time, the whole family was content, spending idle years, hardly knowing that there were still worries in the world. That year happened to be my late father's seventieth birthday. In September, we offered him countless toasts for his birthday. Mr. Zhu Zhenzhuang wrote two poems for his birthday, which included the lines "Serving parents, I made a plan to escape fame, I heard of a ban on drinking with guests, White hair offers countless toasts, Yellow flowers bloom around the house." At that time, many friends gave poems and paintings, but now they have all been looted. My husband's drinking friends, such as Zhong Haihang, Lu Gengcun, Huang Saihong, and Yao Yuanchu, all came to my humble house to drink for a long night, reveling until dawn. I fulfilled the duties of a hostess, serving warm wine. Because the servants were asleep late at night, I sometimes joined in the fun and drank a few cups. When the rooster crowed, the host and guests were all drunk. Thinking about it now, it is truly a case of "a good gathering is not always, and a grand banquet is hard to have again."</p>
<p>Various Aspects of Boarding Houses and the Sculpting of Isolated Island Landlords  Shen Xishen</p>
<p>The hotel industry in Shanghai has always been very developed, and it feels even more prosperous today, after August 13th. This, of course, is the reason that people from various places come to seek refuge. Because finding a house is very difficult on this isolated island, where land is expensive and houses are scarce, many middle- and upper-class refugees take hotels as temporary shelters, and some open rooms for long-term residence. Therefore, almost every room in every hotel is occupied by lodgers every day. The hotel door often hangs a sign saying "full," which is really a busy and unprecedented scene.</p>
<p>There are also many special travelers who open rooms for recreation. They are not only free but also rich, so they are most welcome by the waiters in the hotel. If the partners are complete, they may as well play a few rounds of mahjong, and when they are in high spirits, they may call a few female guides to talk. Their lives are really leisurely!</p>
<p>Living in a hotel is indeed very comfortable, especially in a high-end hotel, such as a restaurant or apartment, where the equipment is so complete. There are fans in summer and water heaters in winter. It is warm as spring all year round. When the electric bell is pressed, the waiter rushes to meet you. Being in it, there is a sense of joy that one does not want to go home! But there is a prerequisite, that is, there must be enough legal currency. Otherwise, if the money is exhausted, and the hotel owner issues an eviction order, it will make you laugh or cry!</p>
<p>After 9 p.m. every night, it is the most lively time in the hotel. All kinds of travelers are active at this time. The sound of cards is loud, and the Beijing tune is melodious. It is really a short good night! In the morning, it is quiet enough to hear a pin drop, because the travelers are having a good dream at this time!</p>
<p>The Deformed Development of Landlords and Tenants  Yi Zhi</p>
<p>The isolated island is crowded with people, and the problem of housing becomes serious. At the same time, those who are second landlords are very lucky. Everyone hopes to be a second landlord and make a fortune in this opportunity. So, a small house is rented from A to B, B sublets it to C, C sublets it to D..., making use of each other and making money from each other. So, A is a second landlord, B is also a second landlord, and C and D are also second landlords. Therefore, "second landlord" has become one of the "isolated island local products".</p>
<p>However, in addition to the second landlord, there are also "third landlord", "fourth landlord" and so on. Believe it or not.</p>
<p>My neighbor is a rice shop. The second landlord of the rice shop is the noodle shop next door. The back hall, front building, back building, pavilion building, second floor and third floor of the rice shop are all for rent. However, the third lodger on the back building and the third floor sublet a part to two single men. Are these two third tenants of the rice shop not turning into "third landlords"? And those two single men have become the "fourth tenants" in the rice shop. What is especially interesting is that the "fourth tenant" who lives on the second floor sublets half of his bed to a fortune teller. In this way, the "fourth tenant" who lives on the second floor has become the "fourth landlord", and isn't the fortune teller a "fifth tenant"? If the bed of that "fourth landlord" is very big, then, I think that fortune teller can sublet a quarter to another person, and he can be the "fifth landlord".</p>
<p>Originally, the Taoist thing was not known to outsiders, because the dispute over the "room rent" one morning exposed the "secret".</p>
<p>Then, we can guess that if the housing problem is not completely solved, there will be more troublesome and complicated disputes in the future. Because in the near future - maybe in front of you, the dispute about rent is not only about the landlord and the second landlord, but also about the second landlord and the third tenant, but also the third landlord and the fourth tenant, the fourth landlord and the fifth tenant, and even the fifth landlord and the sixth tenant, the sixth landlord and the seventh tenant.</p>
<p>Is this a good phenomenon?</p>
<p>Difficult to Find a House  Qiu Lang</p>
<p>My friend Yu, he is a small clerk in a company, and his monthly income is also very limited. It is already difficult to make ends meet, let alone in today's extraordinary period. Various companies and shops are implementing austerity policies, and laying off employees and reducing salaries is nothing. Although Yu is lucky enough not to be laid off, it is naturally difficult to escape the reduction of salary! His family originally lived in Zhabei. After the war broke out, he hurriedly took refuge in the Qi family in the Public Concession. Not long after, a Wuyi fellow villager came to the Qi family. His temperament was very violent, and they even quarreled, overwhelming the host, and issued an eviction order to him! He told me the other day that he has been working hard to find a house recently, but it is still difficult to find a house that he can afford the rent. He first had a feeling of laughter and tears! Although I deeply sympathize with him, I can't help him, and I just shout helplessly. I wrote a song to record it. I think there are not a few people on the isolated island who feel the same pain as my friend. The song says:</p>
<p>Where to find a house? South of the bridge and north of the creek, running around hard every day, competing everywhere, "clothing and food" and "housing and transportation", the word "housing" is the most important, reducing food and saving clothes, how can you sleep in the open? You came from Zhabei, and ran to the Qi family in a mess, you let a house, but you met a vicious snake, and you were actually evicted! The center suddenly trembled, entrusting people and searching for yourself, it is always difficult to predict the residence, getting along is like pins and needles, the wife is angry and the children cry, the isolated island is an expensive place, and the city of Shanghai has been known for its extravagance since ancient times. Moreover, today, the victims are full of pits and valleys. Alas, the owners of real estate, unpredictable, don’t understand to save compatriots, and arbitrarily demand, the weather is cold and the year is coming to an end, who sympathizes with this poor situation? Not to mention no meat to eat, first feel no house to live in, Du Ren's words are worth reading, how can we get thousands of wide houses, and all the poor scholars in the world will be blessed.</p>
<p>How to Avoid Fire Disasters  Xin Liang</p>
<p>Every year, countless fires are caused by the carelessness of some people. Therefore, the entire United States held a large-scale Fire Prevention Week between October 9 and 15 last year. The purpose is to call on everyone, regardless of men, women, old and young, to pay attention. At that time, a specialist was sent to each family to inspect for a week and explain various fire prevention methods to the people. The Idna Company also published the following set of questions as a general fire prevention policy for families.</p>
<p>In the bedroom: (1) Does anyone smoke in bed? (2) Are there matches? If so, please see if they are in a safe place. (3) If a fire suddenly breaks out at night, is there a door that can be used to easily go outside from the bedroom? This passage should not be blocked by other things.</p>
<p>In the bathroom: (1) Are portable electric stoves and gas stoves placed next to clothes, towels, and other flammable materials?</p>
<p>In the kitchen: (1) Matches must be placed in the safest box, otherwise, they are very easy to cause a fire. (2) Is the stove placed close to</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Declares Neutrality Law Does Not Aid Peace; Stimson Advocates Aiding Britain and France to Curb Aggressive Ambitions of Dictatorial Nations</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt stated to journalists today that the Neutrality Law does not contribute to peace and, in fact, encourages certain countries to threaten war. When asked if he favored repealing the Neutrality Law, the President declined to elaborate, stating that the issue was not currently under discussion. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt officially stated today, "I believe that under the Neutrality Law, the United States' influence on peace is less strong than it would be without this law." When asked about the impact of the Neutrality Law on the Sino-Japanese War and the Spanish Civil War, the President replied that he could not comment on specific situations. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>(New York) Former Secretary of State Stimson sent a letter to the New York Times, advocating that the United States Navy should take action if fascist countries invade Britain and France. He stated that fascist countries could attack Britain and France with force at any time. Based on current impressions, such an attack would be a joint effort by the three fascist powers. To defend against this joint action in Europe and Asia, it is necessary for the navies of the three major democratic countries – Britain, France, and the United States – to act together. If any of these three countries attempts to remain aloof, the result will be mutual devastation. Conversely, if the fascist powers realize that the three major democratic countries have such a joint action plan, they will not dare to initiate hostilities lightly. Today, the aggressive bloc is stronger than Britain and France in terms of air and land forces. Furthermore, their substantial navy restrains the British and French fleets in European waters, while threatening the entire Western Pacific, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Singapore, the linchpin for protecting these areas, with the powerful Japanese navy. If France, Britain, or the Netherlands are threatened or destroyed, they would inevitably cede some territories in the Western Hemisphere or the East to the fascist powers, or make concessions to the fascist powers that would further endanger the security of the United States. Is this not something to be expected? Can we stand idly by and watch such a situation develop, while vainly hoping to improve our own position? Today, the iron fist of Germany is even more evident than it was in the years before the European War. Is today the time for the United States to forget the lessons of the past? The New York Times editorial supported Stimson's proposal, stating that this policy of the United States does not require overseas alliances, but only requires prudent consultation with other law-abiding nations on self-defense strategies. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Times published a letter from former Secretary of State Stimson yesterday, and the New York People's Forum newspaper has now responded with alarm. To what extent do the democratic countries share the same views? What is the relationship between the United States and the dictatorial countries? All Europeans only need to read Stimson's letter to understand. Stimson's proposal that the United States should declare in advance that it will assist the democratic countries with military force once they are attacked is logical and understands reality. It is fortunate that President Roosevelt's national defense build-up plan is sufficient to prevent war. If the United States backs the democratic countries with its strength, the totalitarian countries will have no hope of winning and will inevitably retreat in the face of difficulty. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Former Secretary of State Stimson's letter, published in the New York Times yesterday, has been commented on by diplomatic circles here, stating that this letter, if effective, can clarify the conflicting opinions of the two factions in the United States regarding foreign policy, namely the isolationists and those who support President Roosevelt's current policies, so its significance is extremely important. U.S. government officials said that the reason why the European situation is tending towards relaxation is partly because President Roosevelt has adopted a firm attitude, and partly because the United States has sold aircraft to Britain and France. It is hoped that the United States will maintain these two measures and, when necessary, intensify its efforts in accordance with the guidelines suggested by Stimson. U.S. business leaders said that British Prime Minister Chamberlain's policy of appeasement is sufficient to avoid war, and the United States should not interfere in European affairs. However, the majority of American public opinion wants the government to continue to be vigilant and not be taken advantage of by events. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Sends Envoy to Celebrate Papal Coronation; Creates New Diplomatic Precedent</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's decision to send U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Kennedy, to Rome to celebrate the coronation of Pope Pius XII has surprised political circles here. In the past, the United States had no diplomatic relations with the Vatican and had never sent a special envoy to celebrate a papal coronation. It is widely believed that Roosevelt's resolute decision to create a new precedent is intended to strengthen his anti-fascist policy and strength, and to indicate that times have changed, and American diplomacy does not need to adhere to old conventions and can explore new paths. (Haitong, 8th)</p>
<p>Dublin: De Valera, President of the Executive Council of the Irish Republic (who is Catholic), went to Rome this evening to celebrate the coronation of Pope Pius XII. The Republic's Foreign Minister, Walsh, accompanied him. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Expansion Bill Passed by Senate; Most of President's Defense Plan Can Be Implemented</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Senate today passed the government's proposed $360,000,000 army expansion bill by a large majority. The bill is now referred to a joint conference of the Senate and House of Representatives to resolve some differences, such as the Senate approving 6,000 army aircraft, while the House of Representatives limited it to 5,500, and the air force budget was limited to $300,000,000. It has now been agreed that the profits of aircraft manufacturers, etc., are limited to 10%. Once this bill is enacted, most of President Roosevelt's $550,000,000 defense plan will be implemented. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the air force expansion bill, after the Senate yesterday passed an amendment to increase the total number of U.S. Army aircraft to 6,000 (the original bill passed by the House of Representatives proposed to increase the total number of Army aircraft to 5,500), today it passed the entire bill by a vote of 77 to 8, with a total cost of $358,000,000. Prior to this, an additional clause was passed, proposing to use $300,000,000 for the air force, with the allocation as follows: (1) $170,000,000 for ordering aircraft; (2) $130,000,000 for purchasing bombs, increasing the number of air force personnel, paying salaries, and researching aviation technology. The remaining $58,000,000 will be used to adjust the existing equipment of various factories to meet military needs, and to strengthen the defenses of the Panama Canal Zone, especially air defense and coastal defense. As the bill passed by the Senate is broader in scope than the one passed by the House of Representatives, a joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives will be formed to discuss and find a compromise solution. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Shift in American Public Opinion</h3>
<p>(New York) Indiana Democratic Congressman Louis Ludlow introduced a constitutional amendment to the House of Representatives in 1936, advocating abolishing the President's power to declare war and changing it to a decision by public referendum. The House of Representatives then decided that this bill did not need to be discussed. Now, twelve senators have also introduced similar bills, which have not yet been submitted for discussion. The American Institute of Public Opinion, in order to gauge the direction of public opinion, conducted a public opinion survey. The results have now been announced. Here is a comparison with the results of the four surveys conducted in 1936, 1937, 1938 and 1939:</p>
<p>The rise and fall of support for abolishing the President's power to declare war can be seen from this. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Chief of Naval Operations States: Not Worried About Japanese Competition; Will Maintain 5-5-3 Ratio; Naval and Army Forces to Conduct Exercises Next Month</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Leahy, speaking to reporters today, if Japan implements its plan to compete with the British and American fleets, the United States will also build more warships to maintain the 5-5-3 ratio. The Philippines may become independent in 1946, and the United States will then have no obligation to defend the island. After visiting the New York World's Fair, the U.S. fleet will return to the Pacific in early July. The U.S. Navy's review in the Caribbean and South Atlantic was quite successful. The U.S. fleet is sufficient to compete with any country's fleet. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Chief of Naval Operations Leahy roughly disclosed the results of the U.S. Navy's exercises in the Caribbean, stating that several of the attacking force's destroyers and submarines had penetrated deep into San Juan, Puerto Rico, and a certain location northeast of Haiti, but the attacking force's transport ships did not enter within range of U.S. fire. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Army and Navy personnel stated today that the Army and Navy will conduct joint exercises in mid-April, with the aim of repelling enemy invasions of the Atlantic coast. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Canadian Prime Minister Expresses Relief at Calmer European Situation</h3>
<p>Ottawa: Canadian Prime Minister King stated in the House of Commons today that the news from Europe six weeks ago was extremely serious, so he invited Conservative Party leader Manion for a talk, informing him of events that could not be announced to Parliament. Since then, although the seriousness of the information has diminished slightly, it was still enough to worry the government. Until recently, in the past day or two, he could happily say that the prospects seemed to have become much clearer. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>British Trade Minister to Visit the United States After Visiting Germany and Russia</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Overseas Trade Minister Hudson is scheduled to visit Berlin and Moscow this month. After returning home, he will represent the British government and travel to the United States to attend the opening ceremony of the New York World's Fair (on the 30th of next month). He may take the opportunity to meet with U.S. authorities and exchange views on the implementation of the Anglo-American trade agreement (concluded in November last year), and then return home via Canada. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) During the House of Commons meeting this afternoon, Business Secretary Stanley stated that when he visits Germany this month, he will conduct negotiations with German government authorities on various issues related to Anglo-German trade, but he does not intend to involve political issues, nor does he intend to grant Germany short-term credit loans. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Great Mathematician Passes Away</h3>
<p>Munich: World-renowned mathematician Professor Lindemann of Germany passed away at his private residence in Munich on the 6th of this month, at the age of 87. Lindemann initiated the debate on squaring the circle in 1882. Lindemann was the first person to prove that squaring the circle is impossible. During his lifetime, the Prussian Academy of Sciences awarded him the prestigious Steele Prize. (Haitong, 8th)</p>
<h3>Britain Reveals Propaganda Policy; Subsidizes Reuters for Telegrams During Tense European Situation</h3>
<p>(London) The House of Commons discussed the Foreign Office's budget proposal today, totaling £259,087. Deputy Foreign Secretary Butler gave a speech to explain, stating, "After the outbreak of war in Shanghai on August 13, 1937, the British naval authorities there, together with the British Consul-General and the local relief committee, handled the evacuation of British women and children. From August 17th to 24th, a total of 3,800 women and children were sent to Hong Kong on six chartered transport ships, at a total cost of £8,000. In addition, 2,300 women and children left Shanghai at their own expense. Furthermore, during the tense Czech situation in September last year, the government allocated a large sum of money to Reuters News Agency, entrusting it to broadcast news to the world daily through radio stations in Leafield and Rugby. If the House of Commons knew that a certain Austrian news agency was sending out about 20,000 words of news every day, it would understand the value of this subsidy." The members then passed the original bill by a show of hands. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha presented the Army budget proposal for the next fiscal year (1939-1940) to the House of Commons, totaling £161,133,000, and explained that Prime Minister Chamberlain issued a statement on the 6th of last month stating that Britain and France maintain a joint relationship, and if France is attacked without provocation, Britain will support it with all its forces. Therefore, the British Army must prepare everything to be able to travel to the European continent and participate in the war when necessary. As for the goal of talks between the British and French general staffs, it is limited to formulating a joint defense plan and has no aggressive intent. But since the general trend is such, we must rectify our military equipment so that all troops receive sufficient supplies, and we must especially pay attention to our own defense to ensure the safety of our people.
