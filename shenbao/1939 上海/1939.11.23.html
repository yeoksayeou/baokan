<h3 id="c11">歐洲的經濟戰 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>歐洲各交戰國間在軍事方面成爲初步膠着的形態，而經濟戰爭則漸入劇烈的階段。在過去幾天以內，大批船隻在英海岸觸及水雷沉沒；損失極巨大。據一般觀察，或係德國所置一種新發明的磁性水雷：果眞這樣，德國在經濟方面顯已開始採取新攻勢。過去德國以潛艇政策報復英法的經濟封鎖，終因英法實行商船護送制，而减低其作戰的效能；現在以水雷置諸航路之中，任經過的船隻自動觸發，則不僅輕而易舉，且可避免自身遭受損失，實是一種運用新武器的新戰術。</p>
<p>濫放水雷於航路中，是否違背國際公法，是否合乎人道主義，自有公道的判斷，我們姑置不論；至於這種戰術在國際的反響怎樣，當　各受損失國家對於德國的關係和政策而決定。德國之所以敢出此舉：一因美國自修改中立法案後。其船隻不能航行各戰事區域，當不致像第一次歐戰時引起直接的衝突；二因德國明知歐洲各中立國家決不願意輕易對德宣戰。至於德國的眞正企圖，要在破壞英法兩國的海外商務往來；並威脅環繞德國四週的各中立國家，望也門自動的停止對英法貿易，加强對德國的經濟連</p>
<p>在這次歐戰中，德國的經濟情勢，和第一次大戰時。略有不同：對蘇聯修好，解除了陸上封鎖：地中海方面則有義大利爲門戶，還可維持；其貿易路徑；此外又和羅馬尼亞，南斯拉夫·保加利亞等國，先後訂立商約；和愛沙尼亞·丹麥·匈牙利等國進行商務談判；和荷·比·瑞士等國繼續維持平常時期的商務。故英法對德國號稱經濟封鎖，而實際上德國仍得經營國外貿易。尤如比利時的煤鐵鋼和銅鉛，荷蘭的肉類食品和煤，瑞典的鐵礦，羅馬尼亞的石油穀物與魚類，保加利亞的小麥與皮革，南斯拉夫的各種礦砂，都是德國所缺乏的；這些商品如不大量輸入德國，就將爲英法所收買。因此德國曾經警告國各中立國，要求她們斷絕對英法的商業往來；又與羅馬尼亞及瑞典進行商務談判，擬以物物交換的方式，擴大彼此商務關係；最近又傳德國已邀請東南歐各國，召開一種經濟會議；這數天德國在經濟戰爭中所採取的新攻勢，這是對英法的威脅，亦是對各中立國的一種實際警告。</p>
<p>英法的戰時經濟，本來是依賴各殖民地支持；現在德國這種「新戰術」的攻擊之下，其所需的各種原料及食品，無論來自何地，都將有遭受襲擊的危險。據傳羅馬尼亞與南斯拉夫，或將因此而停止對英海上交通。這當然給英法以相當的不利。不過在戰爭中一種新戰術的運用，必然會有另一種新戰術來應付：英法爲報復德國水雷戰術起見，兩國政府決定即將封鎖德國出口貿易。凡是德國的出口貨物，均可在海上加以扣留。而德國也宣稱將採取反報復行動。此後英法德三國的經濟戰爭，勢必隨着戰爭時期的延續而愈益緊張尖銳。</p>
<p>尤其値得注意的，德國對於英法的經濟攻擊，現在還祗限於英國海面；將來就難免不轉移其目標於英法所屬的各處殖民地。世界經濟原是息息相關，僅歐洲一隅的經濟戰爭，已使全世界受得很大的影響；假如不幸而擴張到歐洲以外，將有使全世界經濟機構陷於混亂的可能。過去的中日戰爭，雖還沒有掀起整個太平洋中的風波；但德國收買蘇聯海參崴的潛艇倘使成爲事實，而橫濱等處所謂神秘的軍艦巡邏行動，也日益顯著的話，一般在遠東方面經營海上貿易的各國商民，恐怕也就難免要感覺切膚之痛了！</p>

<p>本棉交易尙稱不弱、中外各廠之納胃漸形開展、此因海外棉市無鬆落之望、還是採辦本棉較爲合算、同時紗綫市價比較疇昔提高一步　所以廠方雖無大量搜羅、然以改變作風、不及以前之沉悶矣、售價因之徐徐上進、久遠停滯之日廠內外廠、亦買一千包、目前因蘇北來源尙不絕、人心抑平、不過照外棉狀况論之、棉市基礎、不致搖動也、碼頭上到通花一千四百十五包、常陰沙四百六十九包、北沙來一千六百九十包、茲將現棉情形列左、（廠家之價係送廠包烘水、同業成交係棧交）、</p>

<p>上日大漲之紗市、昨則父入於平穩寗靜之途、此因客銷未見躉批發展、且手中執貨之大戶、市價在上升時極願脫貨求現、勢鬆動、然海外棉市依然挺昂、印棉漲風允劇、廠方成本提高、故有一部份採取逢低收進之意、就此而論紗市基礎、暫時或不致於大落、不過實需尙屬太滯、</p>
<p>現紗晨開承上日之餘威續進、再漲四五元、二十支雙馬外棧現貨價爲六百四十六七元、但均係同行成交、港帮仍少精彩、而無大量採辦、至於客帮吃幾包粗紗、對於細紗仍寥寥無幾、同行吃飽束手不進、忽見回挫幾元、二十支雙馬收盤價爲六百四十三元、與上日無甚軒輊、其他牌子尙堅、粗紗允昂、廠方無舉動、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>

<p>昨日米糧各帮來源、因天雨連綿、略形轉稀、共到蘇嘉崑太楓靑等貨三千餘包、因前日午市曾一度回緊、晨間猶有餘氣、續有喊高、無如本鄉銷塲不暢、兼之囤戶見勢不佳、方謀脫手、供過於求、結果無論粳尖價、現定中帶軟、繼有貶短四五角者、總之市面在大跌之後、已呈徘徊之局、統計全市成交六千餘包、</p>
<p>客秈昨日零星到頭尙見蟬聯、雖乏大戶整批來滬、而途中零批小票則可絡繹抵埠、晨市因舖作客囤之趁低貪辦、市面一度提高、然客秈價至卅二元半已比中决厚米爲昂、實銷終不敢暢辦、因此後市又復轉平、結果與前市無大出、全日到銷的有近三千包、</p>
<p>洋米昨因星期三外匯未結、談妥之兩批未有正式成交、華洋商仍在兜售中、售價不一、一說產價報漲、西貢一號須卅五元四角方可續定、則已較大二角、一說期貨祇須卅四元六角可以續訂、惟目下訂辦通劃、後市尙可繼續採運云、</p>
<h3 id="c86">粉麥不改堅挺 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>麺粉</p>
<p>昨日現粉交易活潑、監經北洋帮烟台青島及南洋帮港厦等處均有辦意、惟各廠以目下原料價貴、生產减少、故售意日緊、對於整批交易　悉加限制、聞砲車粉客盤、已由七元三角升至四角、兵船牌本盤雖仍爲七元二角、而客盤已不願供給、回籠貨供求兩少、因受米價回跌影響、行囤已並不十分貧取、統市成交的近五寓包、市面明定暗挺、</p>
<p>小麥</p>
<p>昨市亦屬步挺、蓋緣目下存到兩少、執貨者均思貯棧待價而沽、廠胃及行囤需求、亦不亟亟、市經前日一度擯持後、昨已開始正式成交、常州麥開過十一元三角、其他各貨、悉漲一二角、聞目下洋麥漸有接近之可能、一旦來源通達、則本麥前途、必受相常影響、</p>
<h3 id="c87">雜糧　黃豆腳地堅穩 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>邇來黃豆市况、在謠傳產區有實施統制之下、到頭因之不暢、人心看好、行市比較上週漲起半元有奇、刻下到存不旺、故脚地依然堅穩、昨由香港帮辦去崇明沙黃三百餘包、價爲十四元五角至五角半、其他本街成交蕪湖豆五六百包、價爲十三元七角半至九角、丁家州豆三百包、價爲十三元九角、南京豆二百包、價爲十三元六角、豆子昨由北沙運來一百二十包、</p>
<h3 id="c88">糖市　晉江糖價　高昂未有 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>國糖昨市依然活潑、建帮續開刁靑二百五十包、三十三元半、决之二百餘包、三十三元二角、潮帮開出高黃崗靑三百餘包、三十六元、據晋江訊、糖價高昂、爲前所未有、白糖高至九十餘元、赤糖亦達七十餘元、決無來申可能、公會劃盤趨勢平定、現貨二四粗白外棧老貨五十一元半、新貨五十二元、太古車白B嘜東棧五十五元、西棧五十五元半、餘照退、荷赤四十一元至四十一元半、本綿白及一號冰均呌原價、無甚更動、</p>

<p>蜜棗近以來源時有續到、去化反稀、頗呈供過於求之象、價乃回降、昨市徽工禿禿一百十元、蘭谿秃秃一百元、普通九十元、比前小去近十元云、</p>

<p>日來滬埠市况、隨日美絲價之昂漲、而步形穩定、白廠經美商買氣、續而不褻、至昨日因海外市價一致下降、本埠市氣亦轉沉悶、美莊進胃淡薄、廠經售盤、仍告穩定、藝滬埠勻度絲存底究屬不多、昨達昌進一二十担、價四一五〇元、久乏起色之菲銷、昨對於黃土絲、驟起吸購、計採辦沔陽黃州等貨三十担、價一〇二〇元、際此土絲交寂之時、開價尙屬不惡、</p>
<h3 id="c91">疋頭　東疋北銷活躍　國布廠盤提高 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>國布廠盤提高、本街同業及國戶心思向昂、買風稍盛、本月份及下月份細布·細斜。色丁·坯布·細紗錢府綢坯布成交數額甚巨、市盤轉堅、色布·色斜·細布·細斜每疋漲一二角、怡和粗布輕重磅每疋漲五分至一角、甬溫帮辦各檔粗布一百餘包粵港帮辦細布。細斜·粗布七八十包、綫呢·色布·色斜」百餘箱、閩帮辦色斜。士林竹布四千餘疋、蘇北及蕪湖各地辦色布等貨三千數百疋、</p>
<p>東疋細布·細斜漲後回跌、晨市形勢頗軟、十二磅龍頭細布低盤降至每疋十八元二角、嗣以北帮及本街採銷仍旺、成交白貨七百餘件、後市售盤復昂、龍頭現貨喊十八元四角、細斜十七元六角、然較前日高峯尙差落每疋二角至二角半、行方無開貨、故據同業觀察、市氣頗穩、</p>
<h3 id="c92">五金　鐵坯本釘見疲 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>黑鐵坯子廠銷如鏡子廠熱水瓶廠印鐵廠印刷廠等均有採辦、市塲存貨爲數眾多、且海外定貨源源裝來、如怡和·寳隆·聯益·冠華·禮和·喊利等數洋行不絕供給、因現貨擁擠，如二百磅裝貨每箱售七十五六元、二千磅裝貨則每件售八百元光景、較往日跌落十分之一左右、</p>
<p>本釘以本街建築帮爲大主顧、近因所辦不旺、故開價一落再落、由五十元至四十七元、後再至四十五元、昨市僅售四十二三元矣、</p>

<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>我們聽幾個人奏一闋相同的樂歌，在有一定規則的韻律和文字下，說明各人情緒的不同。不止音樂如此，無論一種什麼藝術，內容都必須寄託於形式之上，而形式多少要受牠的潛移。外表的形式儘管相同，但你不能忽略牠內在的動力。當激蕩於內的動力發生各自的波瀾時，那是隱藏蘊蓄在內部的歧異，即使你不能從外表上分別，然而你仍舊可以從事物的核心抉擇牠的靈魂。情緒和音樂並沒有差別。同是一種情緒，你憤怒，他也憤怒，你贊歎，他也贊歎；然而這其間大有差別；這不僅是程度的深淺，重要的還在於情緒的發源。</p>
<p>情緒的存在，在於人心，是不免主觀的。然而你再一追究：人把一種心理的變動，由生理心理的因緣巧合，無中生有地構成一種境界，這在一刹那問是一幅縹緲不成形的心的網膜，在構成前，一個很短而神秘的時間中，像蜘蛛抽絲一樣，拉開一根根灰白輕微的長錢。牽絲的方式，在構成一面網前，確實會影響到未來的那一面網的，通常因爲這一幅網構成得太快了，你不能分別出牠的「經營」和「存在」，以爲除去主觀，別無客體。這種見解是錯誤了。我以爲刹那間情緒的湧現，不妨看作一個客觀的境界，你怎樣織那些蜘蛛的長絲，一幅網便算是你的製作物。每一個「情感之網」的織工，織出不同的網，這網便是他們的寄託。</p>
<p>以「金河王童話著名的作者羅斯金（Ruskin）在「近代畫家論」中把情緒的各方面分析得仔細。他的主要觀點是認爲情緒有高尙卑下之分，而高尙與卑下則又全看其「根據」的原因如何。原因高尙則情緒也跟着高尙。卑下亦復如是。例如贊歎和憤恨，雖不一定是他認爲高尙的情緒，但受到異常的傷害而憤恨和看到蓓蕾將開而贊歎時，這情緒便是高尙的情緒；和被人拿去少數金錢叩憤恨，或是看到烟火及商品時而贊　，截然不同。這所謂情緒的根據」實在便是一種動力，蜘蛛織成網幅時牽絲的方向。</p>
<p>情緒是文學作品中的要素，這很顯而易見。却不知道情緒以外還有一種動力。情緒以外另有隱藏的情緒。情緒相同的一面包含着名不相同的價値。羅斯金的話誰能否認呢？同樣的憤恨和贊歎價値是大有高卑之分的。牠們的價値不在外物（情緒）而在本體（情緒以外的情緒）。情緒的動力左右情緒，正可以用蒙田（Montaigne）的話來說明；—「外物因本體而有色味」。這與其說是情緒的分別，還不如老實說是本體的分別更爲適宜，等於弦聲表面相同而存於心者實異。光武中興時人民夾迫的歡呼，「不圖今日重見漢官儀」！是贊歎，「何姍姍其來遲」一樣是贊歎，「時日曷喪予及汝偕亡！」憤怒，「果有是，吾從若耶！」吳三桂的馬上之語又何嘗不是憤怒。但是這二者之間的情緒，崇高與凡俗都各各不同了。</p>
<p>情緒的動力偉大與吾，無疑的會左右文學作品的偉大。這時代中，我們總算是得天獨厚了，有憤恨有贊歎，這些情緒後面都隱蓄着偉大崇高的動力。切膚的重大傷害，引起憤恨，而光明和愛撫的熱情，又引起我們的贊歎，也都是崇高的情緒以外的情緒，決不比那些貪婪的贊歎和對正義的仇恨，那種無聊的動力推演出來的情緒，是再也不會產生出偉大的文學作品的。葉棻</p>

<p>延安也有專售雜誌的商店和兼售雜誌的書局，如果你一踏進它們的裏面，就會有五光十色的一大堆雜誌書報，把你的視綫迷住，其間除了一大部份來自外埠各處外，就在本地出版的可也不少，並且都能够立出在大時代的前哨上，替大衆打着先鋒，作進展者的響導。不會錯吧：你瞧它排列的陣容，顯示得都是這麼堅强，健全，在這一羣裏是找小出有退後，鬆懈，盲動，消沈的一個來，活潑而又嚴肅的文字，眞能令人一卷在手，又愛又敬，要是讀者們願意知道它一些「履歷」，就讓我在下面一個個來給以介紹吧！</p>
<p>「解放」延安書報出版界中最早的一個，它是跟着國共合作而誕生的，最先原是周刊，後來因爲紙張缺乏，纔改了不定期刊，主辦人是中共黨報委員會，內容大都是黨員的修養，黨的理論和報吿。爲毛澤東，陳紹禹（王明），張聞天（洛甫），成仿吾等經常寫作的處所，曾經一度想遷武漢出版，未果。因着發行的問題曾在西安遭過幾决大難。</p>
<p>「新中華報」由油印而改革到鉛印的一張小型四開報，主辦人是廖忡愷先生的公子承志先生，是給延安大衆傳達新聞的地方報，每逢星期二星期五出版，附刋沒有名字，是報吿文學的延安駐足地，曾經爲着城市和鄕邨的問題各作者在這裏開過筆戰，毛澤東同志出馬調解纔各自收兵。</p>
<p>「團結」是十六開單行本式的一種半月刊，主辦人是邊區政府，內容大部份和「解放報」差不多，不過這裏的稿件，多數是從陝北公學講台上記下來，因此陝北公學同學們買的頗多。此外便是些地方黨政的消息等稿。</p>
<p>「中國靑年」這是十六開單行本式的一種半月刋，因爲執筆者都是一般年靑伙伴們，所以其內容是絕對活潑。熱辣辣地，雄赳赳地，有不可一世的趨勢。如國際靑年運動的歷史介紹，世界靑年人物誌，以及活躍於淪陷區域各地的靑年戰士特寫，都是些難能可貴的稿子，主辦人是中國靑年社。</p>
<p>「中國婦女」沒有穿高跟鞋兒的「中國婦女」，在爭鬥的生活中她們抽得了一些空間工夫在今年六月底把它產生了。是按月出版的刋物，稿子的動向是緊踏在抗戰中的婦女生活問題上，和各地婦女工作動態的介紹方面。主辦人是中國婦女社。</p>
<p>除了這幾種還有「壁報」，「壁報」在陝北多如上海之香烟廣吿，每個街頭隨處都可以見到，就是跑到每個機關，工廠，合作社，也可以在牆頭上覓得他們的大作所在，這裏是他們工作檢討和他們的生活報吿的地方，雖然像陝北公學，抗日大學，中國女大等，以及較大的機關團體都把它用鉛印的，但延安的紙張，運輸是困難的，價又高貴，單就白報紙一項來說：當上海還只另售二分一張的時候，那裏已要賣到一毛錢一張，現在更不必說了，連「解放報」「新中華報」等也改用一種紙質决些的毛邊印行，那裏的紙料缺乏，就可想而知了。</p>
<h3 id="c105">消息 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 公孫僧</p>
<p>當燕子南去，雁羣北來，黃葉滿地的秋天，我開始在一個湖旁安居着，不斷地回憶着，在遼遠的邊地所經歷到的苦痛的記憶。而且常常瞭望着，實在說，我是渴望着春的降臨</p>
<p>可是，春遲遲地躱藏着，而秋却漸漸地深沉了，從我的陋居的窗口，我看見了連天的衰草，和沒有了翠鳥聲如鏡的湖面，即使是樹的投影，也漸漸地在瘦弱了。然而一切的嘆息和憂傷都是徒然，秋不會因被人厭惡而悄悄地溜走。</p>
<p>這時候，有一個朋友却常常從遼遠的異國寄給我書信和安慰，正如我曾爲了求春而受過苦難一樣，那個友人也是爲了求春才被人們迫離開自己的國土的，在我如秋一樣的日子中，由於他，竟也每每能得到一些關於春的消息；假使，我曾向寂寞的河面或靜止的星空微笑過，那末這笑聲該是他所賜與的。</p>
<p>可是，在秋天，連風，連雨也都是悶沉的細微的，湖水是每夜呆滯在湖床裏，祗有微波，沒有浪，星子是每晚釘在天幕上，祗有微光，沒有流動，我看不到春將行來的先兆，也尋不到春的逝去的踪跡。一</p>
<p>然而，有一天，也是那一個朋友吿訴了我一個消息，說是某一晚將有流星的出現，那時候，我是可以看見呆滯的星的跳躍，與平靜的湖的翻動。</p>
<p>那一個晚上，靠着臨水的窗口，我望着平靜的天幕與湖面，我有了一顆喜悅的心了，我彷彿覺得流星和湖水是會給我以春的消息的。</p>
<p>但除了聆着一夜的蟲聲，一夜的風聲，到天明，牠們依舊沒有改換這呆滯的景像。我在窗前徘徊的時問中，曾怨恨着那一個友人。</p>
<p>可是就在那一個晚上，砲聲在一個不遠的都市裏響起來了，早上，當街市匕的人們把那個消息吿訴我的時候，是有着興奮的笑的，於是，我遂恍然知道，流星和湖水眞的在那一個晚上發動了，春也確切已經沒有消息地，突然在蕭瑟的秋氣中來臨了。我慚愧着曾怨恨過的那事，友人並沒有欺騙我，祇是用了另一種的方法來報吿我那個「春」的消息。</p>
<p>過後，我就匆匆地離開了這一個寂寥的湖地，我旣已知道了春的踪跡，旣已看見了春的來臨，那末，我又何必再停留於那一個永遠是秋的環境之中呢？正如南去的求暖的燕子，和北下的避寒的雁兒一樣，我使自己成爲一個走向春去的求「春」的人了。</p>
<p>我就這樣匆匆地走了。</p>
<h3 id="c106">朝氣 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 秉權</p>
<p>明潔，爽朗的秋之晨。</p>
<p>我跳在新鮮的空氣中；用勇健的寬大的步子踏在含着夜露的泥地上；……淸凉的碧綠的氣息使我非常的愉悅。</p>
<p>對面是一叢蒼虬的大樹。太陽把光洒在這邊，那邊，也洒在綠葉組成的圓頂上；露珠在它上面亮着……凝成了一個金色的閃爍的光之海。我被自然織起來的美驚訝住了。錯綜的枝條上有幾片黃葉疲弱的掛着，這該是秋留下的足跡吧。</p>
<p>一種纖細的蟲鳴從遼遠的那方飄過來，是疲倦了吧，懶洋洋的躺進我的耳中，慢慢的寂滅了去。雖說是這樣的微弱，但這是生命的吶喊呵！死亡的嚴冬正躺在前面，殘酷得述一根細草也不讓生存的季節將會到來，這些生命將在死神的魔手下受着威迫；但我相信，它們將在鬬爭中成長起來。有這末一天，它們會强健起來，會把高吭的雄偉的歌聲，驕傲地散佈在大地上。</p>
<p>我有着一種生命的歡喜和慰安；我受到一種新的啟示，對一切都存着一種新生的希望</p>
<p>我凝視着深遠的穹天；深深的吸了一口氣；彷彿我是一個向鬬爭中走去的勇士。</p>
<p>春會緊跟冬來的，我想。</p>

<p>— 華志</p>
<p>梅蘭芳博士有一俄國籍女弟子，芳名雪蓮維娜·布朗（Siavina　Brown），據聞係梅氏於數年前游歷蘇俄後所認識。布朗女士係俄國畫家布朗之妻，年事甚輕，天才亦富，其母係帝俄沙皇時代著名女伶，家學淵源。布朗自幼硏究戲劇舞蹈，粽合東方各國如中國朝鮮印度的古典舞踊，加以演化。她自稱在數年前第一次見到「中國藝壇祭酒」梅先生的舞劍，就表示醉心，投其門下，她開始學習技藝，覺得平劇整套歌舞的趣味，遠非普通分幕的歌劇可比。她學得了訣竅之後，就自立門戶，自我創造，把單調的東方色彩滲以濃厚的西洋趣味。頻年週游各處，頗負聲譽。布朗最近和她的妹子妮娜都南，赴美國鬻藝，表演話劇歌劇舞踊。道出橫濱時，也在該地國際婦女俱樂部公開演出，據談。。「近來已將中國，西藏，蒙古，朝鮮，日本諸種舞藝熔於一爐，能够迎合任何觀衆的口味。至於舞劍技術，完全宗法梅師。」按外籍女子愛好平劇的，前有德國雍竹君，今又有布朗，如所言非虛，倒又是梅派一位健將哩。</p>
<h3 id="c108">瘋狂的紐約女性　克拉克·蓋勃爾對於女人的魔力 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 林公譯美國電影情報影星趣談集</p>
<p>拉克蓋勃爾某决在暖和的春天，好容易得到公司的允許，而給了他二個月的假期。於是他利用這大好的機會，同着他的夫人到各地去旅行，而爲了他的魔力對於女人太大了，所以他每到一處，女人們便像蜂蝶般川流不息的跟着他，使他厭煩極了，結果終於遊玩還不到三個星期，就偷偷的從紐的取道回到好萊塢了。</p>
<p>當他被邀在蘭特爾大劇塲登台的時候當使女人們聽見了這消息後，喜歡得個個像瘋子一般的跳躍着，像打架般往劇塲裏擠，每一塲表演完竣後，她們還戀戀不捨的等着，結果被劇塲裏的職員用强迫手段趕了出來，當克拉克·蓋勃爾在離開戲院和回到戲院的時候，戲院門口無數的女人，包圍着他，歡呼在呌大家拉着他外服，襯衫，領帶，搶他的帽子，奪他的手套，個個想奮勇地擠得和他接近一點，得到他的一撮頭髮或衣衫上的一絲一縷紀念品，因此克拉克的衣服常常被她們撕碎得殘缺不全，他惱恨得幾乎哭了出來。</p>
<p>第二天，克拉克蓋勃爾嚇慌了，他躱在劇塲後台的更衣室裏，從中午直到晚上，但在門口却擁着五千多個女人等着看他，甚至她們衝破警察的警戒綫，在幾千條玉臂用力撞擊之下，終於把劇塲的後台門撞開了，結果却我不到他們理想中的情人，後來風聲傳出來，是躱在鎖着的更衣室裏，這才漸漸的散了一部份。</p>
<p>第三天，克拉克蓋勃爾因爲關在房裏太悶，到窗口去透透空氣，馬上被一個姑娘看見，她就從人叢中衝出，冒着險，從火爐間的小室中爬了出來，她們情願拿性命來換他的簽名，其情雖愚，但他的魔力之大，已可見一斑。</p>
<p>戲院儘是客滿，把老闆快活得連嘴都合不攏來，甚至請求他登台的决數由每天二次而加到每天六决，結果克拉克終於吃不消了，於是帶了夫人秘密地在一個夜深更靜的時候，搭着火車偷偷地逃回來了。</p>
<p>「紐的是這個樣子，我夢也想不到，在三天中就减去了體重五磅，在好萊塢街道上走路一點沒有什麼驚奇，而在紐的却這樣的轟動。」克拉克。蓋勃爾常常對着他的友人說。</p>
<p>據一般批評家說，「克拉克蓋勃爾所以有這樣吸引女人的魔力，是由於他富於男的性感，而可以配稱爲一個「熱男子」</p>
<p>眞的，克拉克·蓋勃爾是女人的活寳貝！</p>

<p>Chongqing: A Chinese source announced today that the war in South China has shifted from the Beihai area to the mountainous regions on the Guangdong-Guangxi border. Intense fighting has occurred there in the past 24 hours. Chinese troops concentrated in the mountainous areas have blocked the Japanese advance into Guangxi Province. Japanese troops in the Fangcheng and Qinzhou areas have been unable to advance due to the Chinese resistance. The central column of Japanese troops that reached Datang was intercepted by Chinese reinforcements in the area. The Central News Agency reported that Japanese planes bombed Bague in Nanning, Guangxi Province, yesterday, with air raid sirens sounding throughout the day. In addition to scattering a large number of political leaflets, the Japanese planes dropped several tons of bombs. Nanning is one of the targets of the Japanese invasion of Guangxi Province. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Nanning: Japanese troops advancing north from Qinxian were severely attacked by Chinese troops near Dabu, suffering heavy losses. A unit of cavalry was intercepted by Chinese troops near Datangxu on the 19th and scattered in retreat. The Japanese troops were also intercepted by Chinese troops at Renziping and Dagangxu, suffering heavy losses. The Japanese troops repeatedly reinforced and advanced directly to Xiaotan, where fierce fighting is currently underway. (Dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to a telegram from Chinese sources in Guangxi Province, more than 30 Japanese planes bombed Nanning yesterday. It is reported that Japanese planes bombed Bague in Nanning and scattered leaflets. It is also reported that other cities in Guangxi Province, including Wuming and Guixian, were also bombed. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Location Unknown: Director Bai recently commented on the Japanese landing on the coast of Qinzhou and Fangcheng, saying, "For more than two years of the War of Resistance, the Japanese have known that military offensives cannot conquer China, but they still take adventurous actions from time to time, attempting to advance deeply and satisfy their ambitions. This time, the Japanese army, navy, and air force jointly landed in the Qinzhou and Fangcheng coastal areas. The military significance of this is to strengthen the blockade of China's seaports and attempt to cut off our southwestern international transportation lines, in order to cut off China's external resources for the War of Resistance. The Chinese army has long been prepared for this and will definitely give the Japanese army a heavy blow. I hope that the people of the country, both military and civilian, will remain calm and persevering, work together with one heart, and fight and sacrifice, so that we will surely crush the enemy's attempt and create an even greater victory." (Dispatch of the 20th)</p>

The other route of Japanese troops was blocked by the Chinese troops 20 kilometers north of Qinxian. The Japanese troops advancing along the Qinnan Highway, with lightly equipped cavalry as the vanguard, had advanced to Datangxu, 55 kilometers from Nanning. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>London: According to well-informed sources here, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the total amount of credit loans repeatedly granted to China by the Soviet Union has reached US$150 million. As a result of the recent visit of Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan of China, to Moscow, this loan has been increased by another US$10 million.

<h3 id="e11">The Economic War in Europe <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>While the military situation in Europe has reached a preliminary stalemate among the belligerent nations, the economic war is gradually entering an intense phase. In the past few days, a large number of ships have sunk off the British coast after striking mines, resulting in enormous losses. According to general observations, this may be due to a newly invented magnetic mine laid by Germany. If this is indeed the case, it indicates that Germany has begun to adopt a new offensive in the economic sphere. In the past, Germany retaliated against the economic blockade by Britain and France with a submarine policy, but this was reduced in effectiveness as Britain and France implemented a merchant ship escort system. Now, by placing mines in the shipping lanes, any passing ships will automatically trigger them. This is not only easy to do but also avoids losses for Germany, making it a new tactic employing new weapons.</p>
<p>Whether indiscriminate laying of mines in shipping lanes violates international law or is in line with humanitarianism is a matter for fair judgment, which we will set aside for now. As for how this tactic will resonate internationally, it will depend on the relationships and policies of the countries that suffer losses towards Germany. Germany dares to take this action for two reasons: firstly, after the United States amended the Neutrality Act, its ships cannot navigate to war zones, so it is unlikely to cause a direct conflict as it did during the First World War; secondly, Germany knows that the neutral countries of Europe are definitely unwilling to easily declare war on Germany. Germany's real intention is to disrupt the overseas commercial exchanges of Britain and France, and to threaten the neutral countries surrounding Germany, hoping that they will automatically stop trading with Britain and France and strengthen economic ties with Germany.</p>
<p>In this European war, Germany's economic situation is slightly different from that during the First World War. Reconciliation with the Soviet Union has lifted the land blockade. The Mediterranean Sea has Italy as a gateway, which can still be maintained for its trade routes. In addition, it has signed commercial agreements with Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and other countries, and is conducting commercial negotiations with Estonia, Denmark, Hungary, and other countries. It continues to maintain normal-period commerce with the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and other countries. Therefore, Britain and France claim to have economically blockaded Germany, but in reality, Germany is still able to engage in foreign trade. The coal, iron, steel, copper, and lead of Belgium, meat and coal from the Netherlands, iron ore from Sweden, petroleum, grains, and fish from Romania, and wheat and leather from Bulgaria, various mineral sands from Yugoslavia, are all lacking in Germany. If these commodities are not imported into Germany in large quantities, they will be bought up by Britain and France. Therefore, Germany has warned the neutral countries, demanding that they sever commercial exchanges with Britain and France. It has also conducted commercial negotiations with Romania and Sweden, intending to expand mutual commercial relations through barter trade. Recently, it was reported that Germany has invited countries in Eastern Europe to convene an economic conference. This new offensive that Germany has taken in the economic war in recent days is a threat to Britain and France and an actual warning to the neutral countries.</p>
<p>The wartime economy of Britain and France relies on the support of various colonies. Under the attack of this "new tactic" by Germany, the various raw materials and food products it needs, no matter where they come from, will be in danger of being attacked. It is rumored that Romania and Yugoslavia may therefore stop maritime traffic with Britain. This will certainly be quite unfavorable to Britain and France. However, in war, the use of a new tactic will inevitably be met with another new tactic. In retaliation for Germany's mine warfare tactics, the governments of Britain and France have decided to blockade German export trade. All German export goods can be detained at sea. Germany has also announced that it will take counter-retaliatory actions. In the future, the economic war between Britain, France, and Germany will inevitably become increasingly tense and acute as the war continues.</p>
<p>It is especially worth noting that Germany's economic attacks on Britain and France are currently limited to British waters. In the future, it will inevitably shift its target to the various colonies belonging to Britain and France. The world economy is inherently interconnected. The economic war in just one corner of Europe has already had a great impact on the world. If it unfortunately expands beyond Europe, there is a possibility that it will throw the world's economic structure into chaos. Although the past Sino-Japanese War has not yet stirred up a storm in the entire Pacific Ocean, if the purchase of submarines from the Soviet Union's Vladivostok by Germany becomes a reality, and the so-called mysterious warship patrol actions in Yokohama and other places become increasingly apparent, merchants from various countries engaged in maritime trade in the Far East will probably feel the pain firsthand!</p>
<h3 id="e12">US Senators Consider Banning Arms Exports to Japan; Hope the State Department Will Issue an Opinion; Japan Says It's Preparing for Treaty Negotiations <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Washington: Democratic Senator Harrison and Republican Senator Carper, members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, hope that the State Department will issue an opinion on Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's draft bill to implement a ban on arms exports to Japan. Carper claimed that after Deputy Secretary of State Welles criticized Japan yesterday for increasing interference in American commerce in North China, they were inclined to support the Pittman bill. Pittman intends to submit his bill to Congress, which will convene in January next year, after the already abolished US-Japan Commercial Treaty expires. The bill authorizes the government and Congress to declare a ban on the export of major raw materials and arms to Japan. Carper claimed, "I would like to hear Secretary of State Hull's opinion on the Pittman bill. I think serious consideration of the bill is valuable." He said that Pittman claimed that if the bill is passed, it would not be implemented, which would also be beneficial to the situation in the Far East. Harrison also said that if the State Department supports the Pittman resolution, then "Congress will seriously consider the bill." He declined to express the merits of the bill, but said that he doubted that the bill could be made into law without "research." Pittman believes that his bill will be passed by Congress, but some people predict that isolationists who are trying to prevent the repeal of the arms embargo clause of the Neutrality Act will obstruct it again at that time, because the Republican isolationists Borah and Johnson will be opponents of the Pittman bill.

<p>Washington: Japanese Ambassador to the United States Kensuke Horinouchi announced here yesterday that Japan is prepared to discuss with the United States some way to continue US-Japan commercial relations after the US-Japan Commercial Treaty of January 26, 1911 expires. Horinouchi claimed that US-Japan issues will continue to be negotiated in Tokyo. US Ambassador to Japan Grew and Japanese Foreign Minister Admiral Nomura Kichisaburo have held preparatory meetings several times. He declined to predict what actions the Japanese government will take when the US declares the expiration of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty and the two sides have not negotiated any agreement to continue commercial relations. Horinouchi denied that he had recently issued a statement saying that Japan was prepared to make concessions to the United States in the Far East as a condition for continuing commercial relations. Horinouchi continued that the US-Soviet commercial treaty negotiations will be held at the same time as the US-Japan commercial treaty negotiations. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington: According to news here today, the procurement of wartime supplies by Britain and France in the United States will be detrimental to Japan's procurement volume in the United States. The longer the time goes on, the more obvious this unfavorable impact will be. As for the current situation, because there is no large-scale war in Europe, the consumption of various materials such as cotton, copper, and oil shortages is not very large, so a panic situation has not yet been created here. As for Japan, because the expiration date of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty is approaching, it has greatly increased its purchases of various wartime supplies here, such as machinery, steel, scrap iron, and fertilizer. However, Britain and France buy with cash, while Japan mostly does not settle the accounts, so in the future, American sellers will inevitably give priority to Britain and France. At present, the United States has mostly sold aircraft and their parts to Britain and France. If Britain and France need a large number of cars and trucks, Japan will get nothing.

<p>Hong Kong: Tokyo Foreign Telegram, Japanese Prime Minister Abe talked about the Sino-Japanese War at a reception for reporters yesterday. He finally said that it is difficult for all parties to be optimistic about the handling of the Sino-Japanese incident. Japan has spent 10 billion yen on the "China Incident." This huge sum of money will not only be borne by the Japanese people of this era, but also by the Japanese people of future generations. Therefore, the entire country should not simply hope that the problem can be easily solved. Even if a "pro-Japanese regime" is established, the "China Incident" cannot be resolved in the near future, and it is too early to talk about withdrawing troops. There are special circumstances in North China and Inner Mongolia, and Japan should not gain nothing because of the establishment of a "pro-Japanese regime." In short, Japan has the mission of enjoying special rights in East Asia in order to build a "New Order in East Asia." The ultimate goal is to establish a cooperative body between Japan, "Manchukuo," and China. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Washington: According to an article on Chinese agriculture published today by the Foreign Agricultural Relations Bureau of the US Department of Agriculture, agricultural production in the Japanese-occupied areas of China has decreased significantly. As for the areas controlled by the Chinese government, there is no damage. It is expected that China will be able to restore its position in international agricultural trade after the war stops. The reason why the agricultural situation in the areas controlled by the Chinese government is still good is that the difficulty of external transportation lines in these areas makes it necessary to turn to a state of self-sufficiency. The article was written by American economist Laussat. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Moscow - Admiral Tributz, commander of the Soviet Baltic Fleet, published an article in yesterday's Pravda, stating that the Soviet Baltic Fleet is awaiting orders from the Soviet government and is ready to attack Finland at any time. According to General Tributz, "The Soviet government deeply cherishes peace, and its proposals to Finland stem from goodwill and mutual benefit, which is universally known. Unfortunately, Finland's response to the Soviet Union is to heed the calls of its politicians, brandishing weapons and preparing for war against the Soviet Union. The tricks currently being played by the Finnish rulers are merely serving as tools for war-makers, using Finland as a battlefield. However, the Soviet Union's determination to establish peace in Finland, eliminate aggressors, and consolidate the Soviet borders of Leningrad and the borders of friendly nations will not be destroyed by any obstacles." General Tributz concluded by saying that the Soviet Baltic Fleet has made great progress in the past few years, with significant increases in the number of battleships, cruisers, mine-laying ships, submarines, and air force.

<p>London - Semi-official sources here refuted German propaganda regarding India, stating that British policy towards India has always aimed at granting it dominion status with complete autonomy through gradual progress. The German claim that the laws promulgated in India are intended for the benefit of the British rather than the Indians is patently absurd. The most important point is that legislative power in India now rests with autonomous provincial councils responsible to Indian electoral districts. Although the central government still retains ultimate British jurisdiction, many important laws in recent years, such as tariff protection laws, have been passed, even if they are detrimental to specific British interests. The German radio station in Zeesen mentioned last week that 90,000 workers in Mumbai were on strike, but in reality, there have been no strikes in Mumbai recently. The German statement clearly refers to a one-day strike at the beginning of October. The Zeesen radio station also mentioned a strike by jute workers in Kolkata, but this matter has long been resolved, wages have been increased by eleven percent, and most workers have now returned to work. This labor dispute is purely industrial and has no political nature. The German report that 100 members of the All-India Congress have been arrested is completely fabricated.

<h3 id="e21">British Prime Minister Chamberlain Announces Decision to Expand Economic Blockade Against Germany; German Naval Warfare Methods Violate the Hague Convention; British and French Navies Cooperate Closely to Seek Retaliation <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>London - In response to a question from Labor Party leader Attlee in the House of Commons yesterday, British Prime Minister Chamberlain announced that, in retaliation for Germany's mine warfare, Britain will confiscate German exports on the high seas, stating that more than ten ships have been sunk by German mines in the past three days, six of which belong to neutral countries, and many lives have been lost as a result. Germany is a signatory to the Hague Convention and declared on September 17 that it was willing to abide by it. According to this convention, when using moored mines, all possible precautionary measures must be taken to ensure the safety of peaceful shipping. This is the most essential point of the convention because mines cannot distinguish between warships and merchant ships, nor can they distinguish between the ships of belligerent countries and the ships of neutral countries. Prime Minister Chamberlain then detailed the articles of the Hague Convention regarding mine-laying, stating that the German government had not complied with any of these articles. Germany's violation of the treaty has reached its extreme. British, Allied, and neutral ships have repeatedly been sunk by German mines, torpedoes, and artillery fire, often without warning, even disregarding the conventions it has signed and showing no regard for humanity. The British government cannot allow such actions to continue without retaliation. During the last Great War, Britain confiscated exports originating from Germany or owned by Germans on the high seas in retaliation for German submarine attacks on merchant ships. Now, in view of Germany's repeated violations of international conventions and its inhumane methods, the government has decided to adopt this measure in the future and will soon issue an Order in Council to implement it. The House of Commons cheered at this announcement. At the same time, regardless of the fact that Cabinet Minister Hankey read Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement in the House of Lords, the House of Lords also expressed its welcome. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Paris - The announcement by British Prime Minister Chamberlain that Britain will confiscate German-made exports on the high seas in retaliation for German mine warfare has been unanimously approved here.

<p>Paris - The British government has decided to blockade German export trade in retaliation for Germany's adoption of naval warfare tactics that violate international law. Official sources here have also announced that the French government will fully participate in this action. Once detailed measures have been agreed upon, the British and French navies will continue to cooperate closely to implement them strictly. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>London - Following Prime Minister Chamberlain's announcement in the House of Commons today of the decision to blockade German export trade, diplomatic circles commented that the British government's action was decided after obtaining the full agreement of the French government and carefully weighing the pros and cons. Germany's export trade is a major source of foreign exchange, and striking at it will have a significant impact. According to international law, this type of blockade can only be used as a means of retaliation. Therefore, although Germany has repeatedly violated international law and infringed upon the rights of neutral countries, the British government has hesitated and has not immediately retaliated. Until recently, British and neutral ships, on the usual routes in British waters, were sunk after hitting German mines. Within three days, a total of ten ships were sunk. The British government's legal advisors all stated that there were sufficient grounds for taking retaliatory measures, and the government resolutely decided to do so. It is expected that certain neutral countries will lodge representations with Britain on this matter, and countries such as Italy and the Soviet Union, which have expressed sympathy for Germany's claims verbally and through diplomatic channels, may lodge protests. The British government is aware of this and will provide various explanations and do its best to alleviate the difficulties for neutral countries. Political figures said that Germany's violation of international law and taking advantage of it has become a habit and cannot be allowed to continue. However, there are also various practical difficulties to overcome in implementing the blockade of German export trade, especially the issue of German goods being transported by land to neutral countries and then re-exported overseas.

"The New York Herald Tribune" vigorously criticized Germany's recent methods of warfare, stating that neutral public opinion has unanimously opposed it because of its six years of military build-up and breaking of promises.

<p>London - Germany's violent naval warfare has intensified in recent days. In addition to the Japanese mail ship "Terukuni Maru" sinking after hitting a German mine today, three British fishing boats were sunk by German submarines. One was the "Telford" (250 tons) with a crew of thirteen, and the other two were the "Sweepstake" and the "Doma Hamkes," each with a crew of twelve. All the crew members have been rescued. The crew of the "Doma Hamkes" drifted at sea in a lifeboat for twelve hours before reaching the coast of Northern Ireland. According to one sailor, "We were fishing at sea when we suddenly saw a German submarine appear on the surface two miles away. It immediately opened fire on our ship, and we all boarded the lifeboat to escape. Soon after, the submarine approached and sank our ship." (Havas dispatch, 21st) The Italian ship "Fianona" sank last night after hitting a mine in British waters. All 33 sailors were unharmed.

<p>Tokyo - The Japanese mail ship "Terukuni Maru," which sank near the east coast of England yesterday after hitting a mine, is the 37th neutral ship sunk by German submarines or after hitting mines since the outbreak of the European war, including eight Norwegian ships, seven Swedish ships, five Dutch and Greek ships each, three Finnish ships, two Danish and Soviet ships each, and one Romanian, Belgian, Italian, and Latvian ship each. The sinking of the "Terukuni Maru" was mentioned at the daily press conference held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A British journalist drew attention to the fact that the official Hamburg Nazi Party radio station declared on November 21 that Germany's purpose in laying mines in British territorial waters was to strike at maritime traffic, saying that Britain could no longer provide for the safe passage of British or neutral ships in its territorial waters. It also stated that Germany deeply regretted the impact of this development on neutral ships, but was unable to do anything about it. The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the Japanese government is awaiting a detailed report on this unfortunate incident. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>London - The Japanese mail ship "Terukuni Maru" of Nippon Yusen Kaisha, with a tonnage of 11,930 tons (yesterday's report erroneously stated 2,930 tons), en route from Japan to England, sank off the east coast of England yesterday, definitely due to hitting a mine. Thirteen British passengers on board were injured, and 180 crew members and 28 passengers, a total of 208 people, were rescued. After the explosion, the ship floated on the surface for quite some time. The explosion sent seawater flying into the sky, which was clearly visible from the shore. Rescue boats immediately rushed to the scene to provide assistance. Officials from the Japanese Embassy rushed to the scene after hearing the news. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>London - Regarding the sinking of the Japanese ship "Terukuni Maru" after hitting a mine, well-informed sources here said that there were 180 crew members on board, making it the second large ship to be innocently lost since the British liner "Athenia" was sunk at the beginning of September. It sank only a few miles off the east coast of England. According to eyewitnesses on the shore, they personally witnessed the ship explode, sending seawater high into the air, and then completely sink forty minutes later. Okamoto, a counselor at the Japanese Embassy, went to the scene to inspect the sea area after hearing the news. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London - Captain Matsukura of the Japanese mail ship "Terukuni Maru" told a Reuters reporter today about the sinking of the ship, expressing his opinion that the ship was not sunk by a mine on the surface of the sea. He said, "There were five specialized lookouts on duty on the 'Terukuni Maru.' After arriving at Downs Port on Sunday for inspection of contraband, the ship received a sailing permit on Sunday afternoon and was given a special signal flag to hoist on the mast. The British naval authorities also notified the ship that 'the northbound route has now been cleared.' The captain waited until 8:30 the next morning to leave Downs. While proceeding forward according to normal navigation practices, the ship struck a mine, the ship shook, and jumped upward, injuring several passengers and some crew members in the head. Eight lifeboats were immediately lowered into the sea, carrying the 208 people on board, and were towed to the shore by several British minesweepers rushing to the scene." (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>London - After the Japanese mail ship "Terukuni Maru" sank in the eastern waters of England today, the ship's deputy engineer, Kawashima, spoke about what happened, stating, "When the ship hit the mine and exploded, I was in the engine room. The violent explosion almost threw me into the air. All the lights on the ship went out. The chief engineer and I immediately stopped the engines, but the gasoline tank had already ruptured, and gasoline was flowing out, covering the floor of the engine room. All the workers in the engine room then went to the deck to prepare to escape. At that time, the bow of the ship had already sunk into the sea, and the stern was exposed on the surface. I quickly went to the cabin to fetch some belongings, and I and other crew members and passengers divided ourselves into eight lifeboats. The captain left the ship half an hour after the explosion. Shortly after, the ship sank." Mrs. Tafel, a passenger, said that the explosion occurred around 1:00 PM while she was in the second-class smoking room. "The passengers, on the orders of the captain, returned to their cabins to find life jackets. I suddenly lost my key. Fortunately, someone gave me another key, and I was able to open the cabin and take out a life jacket. Thinking back now, I am still terrified." (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London - All 225 passengers and crew members of the Japanese mail ship "Terukuni Maru," which recently hit a German mine in the eastern waters of England and sank, were taken ashore by a British ship in the afternoon and transferred to a train to reach here.

Only four of them were seriously injured and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment. One of the passengers, the wife of a British naval officer who had lived in China, told a Havas reporter, "When the 'Terukuni Maru' hit the mine, the entire ship shook. The captain immediately ordered all passengers and crew members to board the lifeboats and then lowered all the lifeboats into the sea one by one. We drifted at sea for a short time and were rescued by a British ship and taken to shore." (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e27">Japanese Side Attaches Importance; Will Adopt Appropriate Measures After Ascertaining the Truth <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo - After the "Terukuni Maru" sank after hitting a mine while sailing off the east coast of England, various circles were greatly shocked. Therefore, the Japanese government is currently studying countermeasures. Once the detailed situation is clarified, effective measures will be taken immediately. The issue of laying mines at sea during wartime was formally signed during the Second Hague Peace Conference held on October 10, Showa 14 (1939). The treaty stipulates that the use of drifting mines is prohibited in both territorial waters and the high seas, and that the governments of all countries should be notified of the areas where mines are laid. Therefore, from a purely international legal point of view, the sinking of the "Terukuni Maru" can only be due to one of the following reasons: (1) It was hit by a drifting mine or a moored mine; (2) In the case of a moored mine, it sank within the area notified by the belligerent country; (3) It sank after hitting a mine belonging to which country. Therefore, the Japanese government will, once the investigation is clear, lodge a protest and take appropriate measures, such as demanding compensation for losses. Furthermore, the Imperial authorities are concerned that such incidents will occur again in the future, so they have decided to consult with the belligerent countries to call their attention. (Domei dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The "Terukuni Maru," which sank in British waters, was completed in May 1930 (Showa 5), with a gross tonnage of 11,930 tons, a length of 154.7 meters, a width of 19.56 feet, a top speed of 17 knots, and a capacity of 235 passengers. It was an excellent passenger ship of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha. The ship departed from Yokohama on September 24 for England, intending to carry Japanese expatriates back to their home country to avoid the war. (Domei dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>London - Among the 28 passengers on the "Terukuni Maru," there were three Japanese passengers: Kin'ichiro Mase, First Secretary of the Japanese Legation in Switzerland; Kenmi Iwasaki, Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in England; and Hayato Nakajima of Mitsui &amp; Co.'s London branch. Secretary Iwasaki was seriously injured. (Domei dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London - The cargo on the "Terukuni Maru" included 800 tons of raw silk, 2,100 tons of textiles, canned food, and wood destined for England, 300 tons destined for Belgium, and 1,000 tons destined for the Netherlands. (Domei dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The hull insurance for the "Terukuni Maru" was 3,283,600 yuan, and the cargo insurance was 1,800,000 yuan. After a meeting of the insurance companies on the 22nd, it was decided to pay the total insurance claim of more than 5 million yuan immediately in accordance with the insurance contract. (Domei dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese ship "Terukuni Maru," which sank yesterday, was not reinsured with any foreign insurance companies. Therefore, the loss of the ship will be fully compensated by domestic shipping insurance companies. The ship was also not reinsured with the government-guaranteed war risk insurance association. The ship was insured with the Tokyo Marine Insurance Company in early spring and then reinsured with several other marine insurance companies. The ship, built in May 1929, cost a total of 7 million Japanese yen. The initial insurance amount was 6.5 million Japanese yen, and the shipping company later increased the insurance amount by approximately 3 million Japanese yen, reaching a total of 10 years. The cargo carried by the ship when it left Kobe this time was valued at approximately 4 million Japanese yen, but about half of it was unloaded along the way in France and other places. When it went to England, it was said to be about 2 million Japanese yen. In addition to being insured with the Tokyo Marine Insurance Company, this cargo was reinsured with foreign insurance companies and war risk insurance associations. Domestic companies concerned convened a meeting this morning and decided to immediately compensate the insured amount. (Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>London – German planes flew over England, Scotland, the Orkney Islands, and the French coast yesterday. Allied forces claimed that three German planes were shot down, and the Royal Air Force also shot down two German planes, one of which crashed in the English Channel. French sources claimed that a German plane was shot down by French forces while reconnoitering the Saint-Nazaire shipyard. Including that plane, the French have shot down a total of twenty-two German planes in the past seven weeks. Last night, there was an air raid warning on the northeast coast of England, and anti-aircraft guns immediately fired into the sky. Details are unknown. Three German planes flew in the sky over the Orkney Islands, where frequent alarms were sounded, urging people to take shelter, but the anti-aircraft gun teams were not very active, and the German planes did not drop any bombs. A German bomber flew over Shetland, flying so low that the German national emblem painted on the wings of the plane was clearly visible. The plane did not stop and flew north. Yesterday was the second day of increased German reconnaissance activity over England, and the fear that German planes would soon bomb major cities has also increased. News from Scotland claimed that the air force was very active on the east coast, and Royal Air Force planes quickly flew to the Firth of Forth in the morning, but no German planes were found there. However, some people heard the sound of planes in the sky. The Royal Air Force was active all morning, but there were no air raid warnings. A fighter plane, believed to belong to the German side, was discovered in the northeast of England yesterday morning, flying very high. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Berlin – According to an official announcement here, the assassin who attempted to assassinate Hitler in Munich on November 8 has now been confirmed as Elser. He was arrested while attempting to illegally cross the Swiss border on the night of the incident. According to an official communiqué, "After the assassination attempt on November 8, the head of the political police, Himmler, immediately took various measures to apprehend the culprit, closing the borders of various countries and strictly investigating suspicious individuals. Among them, a person named Elser, 36 years old, a resident of Munich, was detained. According to the results of the investigation and interrogation by the expert committee, it was determined that Elser was involved in the assassination plan. Although he initially denied it, he fully confessed on the 14th, admitting it without hesitation. It is said that this plan had been in preparation for a long time and was originally intended to be installed in September 1938, but it failed. In August 1939, an explosion chamber was created. A week before the meeting, Elser repeatedly tried to install a timer, but he was not successful until October 4. Elser then left Munich and wanted to report to his instigator in Switzerland, but for some reason, he returned to Munich on the afternoon of the 7th and entered the cellar to check whether the mechanism he had installed was perfect. He tested it many times that night, and the next morning (October 8), Elser took a car to the Swiss border after breakfast, trying to cross the border that night, but he was arrested. According to Elser's confession, the instigator was a British intelligence agency contact named Strasser. Several people have been arrested in connection with this matter. Details are yet to be announced." (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin – The news that the culprit in the Munich bombing case on November 8 was arrested was described this morning by German newspapers in extremely vivid language and published with large headlines to draw readers' attention to the fact that the arrested culprit was employed by British intelligence and that Otto Strasser was the mastermind. The front pages of all newspapers published photos of the culprit "Elser Georg" and the head of the British intelligence agency's Western European Bureau, "Best," and Captain "Stevens," to attract readers' attention and interest. The German people unanimously praised the police for their swift cracking of the case, and street talk showed relief. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Stockholm – After the German official communiqué announced the news that the conspirator in the Munich bombing case had been arrested, Swedish people were very excited when they heard about it. This morning, newspapers published the news in a prominent position, praising the German police for their swift handling of the matter, as the case was solved only two weeks after the incident occurred. Newspapers paid special attention to the background of the conspiracy, involving people outside Germany (such as Otto Strasser). (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Brussels – The news that the conspirator in the Munich bombing case had been arrested was broadcast to France by radio last night, followed by the news that the mastermind had confessed, giving the French public the opportunity to hear the news. Political circles in Paris were surprised and unhappy when they heard the news, believing that the German secret agents released this news with the intention of attacking British intelligence. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>London – The British Foreign Office issued a statement last night, saying that the German government's statement claiming that two British people were among the culprits in the Munich hotel bombing case was "incomprehensible." The German government's statement first mentioned that a German person planted a bomb under a pillar of the hotel, and then said that this person was arrested while trying to escape into Switzerland, and then mentioned that two British people were arrested on the German-Dutch border. These two events are not related. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin – The National Socialist Party's special forces announced last night that the culprit in the Munich hotel bombing case was arrested on November 8 and has confessed. It is said that the person who carried out this unsuccessful assassination was named Elser, 36 years old, and lived in Munich. It is said that there were a total of three accomplices in this case, two of whom were members of the British intelligence agency. Elser was arrested on the day of the bombing attempt while trying to cross the German border to Switzerland. Elser confessed on November 14. It is said that Elser had been preparing for the implementation of this plan for several weeks, starting with burying a bomb under a pillar of the Bürgerbräukeller, causing it to explode after one hundred and forty-four hours (six days), but Hitler left earlier than originally planned, causing the plan to fail. When the German special forces officially announced the arrest of these three people, they also slandered the British intelligence agency as the mastermind of this matter, and the illegal anti-National Socialist Party organization "Black Front" as the organization in charge of this conspiracy. A large number of other suspects have also been arrested. A leader of the British intelligence agency in Western Europe named "Best" and a person named "Stevens" were arrested while trying to cross the German border into the Netherlands. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin – The German official news agency stated that a person named Elser, 36 years old, has now admitted to being involved in the Munich bombing case. This person was about to cross the border into Switzerland on the night of the bombing, but was detained. Initially, he tried his best to deny everything, but then he admitted that he had this plan a year ago. He worked in a Munich cellar for a short time for several weeks. During this time, he secretly placed a time bomb that would explode in six days in the pillar of the cellar wall. The person who funded the hiring was the British secret agency, and the initiator of this plan was Strasser, the leader of the anti-Nazi Black Shirt Front, who was known for his fierce opposition to Hitler. According to Strasser, he recently told people in Paris that after the Munich bombing, he was ordered by the Swiss authorities to leave the country within four hours because Germany accused him of being the mastermind of the bombing and demanded his extradition. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>London – The British Foreign Office claimed that Berlin's statement yesterday that Elser, the key criminal in the Munich cellar bombing case, had been arrested and that he admitted that he was funded by the British secret agency was incomprehensible. The British government and any of its agencies did not know this arrested German. According to news from the Berlin News Agency, the German police had arrested this person the day after the bombing and interrogated him for a long time. It was only now that they released the news that he was funded by the British. Even this point should allow discerning people to assess its truthfulness. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin – Officials here announced last night that British intelligence activities in Western Europe, with its intelligence department based in The Hague, were attempting to carry out conspiracy work in Germany. The British intelligence department believed that there must be revolutionary figures in Germany who opposed the party, government, and military, and wanted to contact them to organize them and attack the interior of Germany. It is understood that the British intelligence department provided them with radio transmitters and receivers to maintain contact with them. On November 9, two key members of the British Western European intelligence department, Stevens and Best, attempted to cross into Germany near Venlo, Netherlands, and were caught by German police and have been taken to a police station prison.

<p>Budapest – At the afternoon session of the House of Representatives, Foreign Minister Csáky attended and delivered an important speech explaining Hungary's current foreign policy, stating, "The independence and sovereignty that our country should enjoy in military, economic, and diplomatic terms must be maintained. We have sufficient patience to quietly await the arrival of the opportunity. Where the national interest lies, we often remain silent for the time being. However, we are always prepared to fight to complete our historical mission, even if it means fighting to the last person. German Chancellor Hitler once said, "Germany has no definite borders." For us, we only need to maintain a firm attitude and be prepared to act at any time, and we do not need to fear anyone or anything." Furthermore, our country has good relations with Italy and is also willing to improve relations with Yugoslavia. We welcome the increasing strength of Yugoslavia. We are watching the development of the situation in Bulgaria with great sympathy. As for Romania, our country has already taken action to clarify relations between the two countries. In the future, it will only be up to the Romanian government to make more efforts, and it will not be difficult to promote friendly relations. Although the Romanian authorities' recent statements have not been entirely satisfactory, for the sake of peace, our country is still prepared to cooperate with all countries to promote the establishment of a neutral group of countries in the Balkan Peninsula.

<p>London – According to news received today from neutral sources, a Franco-Italian agreement will be signed soon. After the agreement is signed, the hope of Italy maintaining neutrality will greatly increase. It is reported that in order to take into account the current Italian-German alliance, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will not sign a formal treaty with France, including the current Franco-Italian reconciliation. However, he is finding ways to implement the agreement. It is widely believed that the agreement will grant Italy full facilities in the port of Djibouti (French Somaliland in Africa), or lease the port to Italy for 99 years. France plans to transfer a large portion of the shares of the railway from the Ethiopian capital to Djibouti to Italy. Italy will also obtain one-third of the shares of the Suez Canal Company and a portion of the company's board of directors. The disposal of the port of Tunis in French West Africa will be the biggest obstacle to negotiations between the two countries. It is widely believed that Italy and France should enjoy cultural opportunities in Tunis, such as using both languages and establishing schools. France may allow Italy to participate in a portion of the political power in Tunis, but the Tunis naval base will still be completely under French control and remain for French military use.

<p>A letter from the "North China Daily News" in Beiping, dated November 13, stated that in recent days, anti-British posters and flags have reappeared on the streets of Beiping, which is somewhat surprising, as less than two weeks ago, the anti-British posters on public buildings had been removed. Even the large Chinese characters "Down with Britain" written on Tiananmen Square in the Forbidden City, equipped with electric lights that shone brightly at night, had also been removed. This move was either due to instructions from Tokyo or due to</p>
<p>Internal Disagreements Among Japanese Authorities</p>
<p>As a result, the anti-British movement here seemed to have subsided, and the Chinese who supported the anti-British movement had lost interest. However, there may be a third reason: the "Anti-British Association" is severely lacking in funds, which is an open secret. The association constantly wastes large sums of money, holding banquets and "discussing the necessary measures to be taken." It is also rumored that the amount of funds embezzled is quite large, so that even the Japanese who control this movement, although they have "Federal Reserve" banknotes that are inexhaustible, are ultimately furious and have reduced the association's monthly subsidy for anti-British activities from 20,000 yuan to a meager 500 yuan. It is no surprise that a "spontaneous anti-British movement" no longer arouses the interest of the Chinese. Some observers believe that the sudden reappearance of anti-British posters is because the association printed a large number of posters when funds were sufficient, and now that they have been printed, they decided to use them rather than discard them. Whether this is the real reason or whether Japanese policy has changed again will become clear in the coming weeks. However, the</p>
<p>Anti-British Movement in Tianjin Has Not Relaxed</p>
<p>The world is already well aware of the "blockade" of the British Concession in Tianjin. However, there has been little news of the "blockade" in recent days. In fact, it is rare to hear of stripping and slapping, but the difficulties and other minor troubles imposed on those passing through the obstacles are as bad as ever. There seems to be a localized reason for this, as the restrictions imposed on entering and exiting the British and French Concessions in Tianjin have now become a "illegal trade" with great profits. It is heard that the police in front of the obstacles extort tolls from Chinese people and vehicles entering and exiting the concessions, and it is heard that</p>
<p>Up to 10,000 Yuan Can Be Obtained Daily</p>
<p>And some estimates reach 50,000 yuan. Chinese people passing through the obstacles are charged a few cents per person, and those carrying vegetables or other food into the concession are charged one yuan per trip, and the more you are willing to pay, the faster you will be allowed to pass. When a certain Chinese was searched in the "inspection shed," a certain policeman frankly asked him how much he would pay before being allowed to pass, and said, "We have to calculate the amount of money we have collected." Also, a certain Chinese drove an empty truck and waited quietly to pass through the obstacles. The police ordered him to pay 50 yuan in total. The driver refused, and the police ordered the car to turn around and drive behind a line of vehicles waiting to pass. When the driver was about to drive backwards, another policeman lowered the price, demanding four yuan, and allowed the car to pass. This is clearly not a "uniform" business. It can be seen that trucks loaded with goods were extorted as much as 300 yuan before they were allowed to pass through the obstacles.</p>
<p>River Traffic Is Also Extorted</p>
<p>A certain British company had to pay Japanese military police 250 yuan before it was allowed to load some goods onto a barge to be carried downstream. With profits to be made in front of the obstacles, anyone who believes that the obstacles will be removed soon is too optimistic. A spokesman for the Japanese army in Tianjin replied to questions from foreign reporters about when the obstacles would be removed, saying that there was no sign of it. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising to hear this. When foreign reporters questioned him about illegal charges, the spokesman replied, "I am not aware of these situations, but I will investigate and take necessary steps if they are true." If such an investigation is conducted, Chinese witnesses will undoubtedly be eager to testify. As a result of this practically open extortion, the prices of food in the two concessions are naturally much higher than outside the concessions. Although there is a large amount of coal stored on the left bank, it is not allowed to be transported across the river, resulting in a</p>

<p>If the Japanese side were to issue a responsible statement clarifying why the blockade continues, its statement would be of interest. However, if the Japanese do not provide a satisfactory explanation, the unanimous opinion of foreigners in Tianjin seems to be quite reasonable, that is, the reason why this absurd blockade is allowed to continue is that it can make great profits.</p>

<p>A dispatch from Dongtai stated that after the Japanese troops in northern Jiangsu captured Huai'an, Baoying, and other counties, they were repeatedly attacked by Chinese troops ×××. The Japanese troops in Huai'an and Baoying have shown signs of fatigue. On the night of the 27th of last month, two Japanese speedboats in Baoying were destroyed by Chinese troops. Since then, they have not dared to travel casually. On the night of the 2nd of this month, Chinese troops attacked Huai'an again, killing many puppet troops and capturing eight puppet troops, eight broadswords, and several puppet flags. The Japanese and puppet troops did not dare to leave the city to harass. However, on the 9th, two small Japanese warships and more than ten speedboats, carrying more than 100 Japanese soldiers with two cannons, sailed north from Gaoyou, with three planes as cover to reinforce Baoying. They were ambushed and severely attacked by Chinese troops at Liujiabao. In this battle, three speedboats were sunk, one small warship was damaged, 30 to 40 Japanese soldiers were killed, and two were captured, along with two rifles and a large amount of ammunition and documents. The remaining Japanese troops fled. Several Chinese soldiers were killed and wounded. Chinese troops immediately attacked Baoying City. Many Japanese and puppet agencies in the city were burned down. After four hours of street fighting, 40 to 50 Japanese and puppet troops were killed and a number of troops were captured. At dawn on the 10th, the Chinese troops safely withdrew, with more than a dozen soldiers wounded.</p>

<p>A dispatch from Ningbo stated that mobile warfare occurs from time to time on Daishan Island in the Zhoushan Islands of eastern Zhejiang. On October 28, a certain unit of the Chinese guerrilla force stationed in Dinghai, led by Wang Xiaonan, staff officer of the Dinghai County Anti-Japanese Command (former chief of the Daishan Police Department), took sailboats and crossed the sea to launch a surprise attack on Daishan at night. The Japanese Third Fleet's Marine Corps Hehe unit, consisting of more than 100 people stationed there, upon hearing the news, divided into two routes and set off towards Dabeifeng Mountain. At 3:00 a.m. on the 31st, the two sides encountered each other in Changkengchang, and a contact battle ensued. After six hours of fighting, with a distance of only 600 to 700 meters, the results were eight Japanese soldiers killed, fifteen wounded, and seven guerrilla fighters sacrificed and three wounded. Wang Xiaonan was injured due to being at the forefront and has been sent to a certain place for medical treatment. The Japanese army was extremely panicked after being attacked. Rear Admiral Hehe, commander of the Third Destroyer Fleet, took a ship to Daishan to reinforce.</p>

<p>A dispatch from Jiangyin stated that at 7:00 a.m. on the 16th, Japanese troops searched Yangshe in the eastern countryside of Jiangyin from Langgan Bridge and Beigua in Changshu. They encountered Chinese troops at the boundary of Jieqiao in Yangshe Shuli Xu, and fought for two hours. The Chinese troops then shifted their position to Yanghui, and a fierce battle broke out again. Then, Japanese planes flew in and dropped more than a dozen bombs, destroying more than a dozen houses and killing and wounding one child each. In order to avoid sacrifice, the Chinese troops shifted to Huashi. It is now reported that after the Japanese planes bombed Yangshe, they flew to Huashi, Zhutang, and Houcheng to bomb indiscriminately. It is reported that a bomb hit Huashi Elementary School, killing more than 40 elementary school students.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Kato Visits and Meets; American Ambassador Travels North Last Night; Kato's Visit Was Merely of a Routine Nature; Preliminary Talks Seem to Be Proceeding in Peiping <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, Japanese Special Envoy Kato visited the office of the American Ambassador to China on Jiangxi Road. The two sides met for about half an hour, after which the Japanese Special Envoy left. Afterwards, according to inquiries made by a "New Voice News Agency" reporter with the American Embassy, Special Envoy Kato's meeting with the Ambassador was only of a routine nature, as this was the first time the two men had met. However, according to news from Tokyo, the meeting between the American Ambassador and the Japanese Special Envoy yesterday touched upon various issues between the United States and Japan in China, and further discussions will continue in the future.</p>
<p>Will Continue Talks in Peiping</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" stated that Japanese Special Envoy Kato visited the American Consulate this morning (22nd) to meet with American Ambassador to China, Johnson, for a courtesy visit. It is said that these two diplomats are old friends, having both served in Peiping a few years ago. This morning's meeting lasted about 20 minutes. It is not certain whether they discussed issues related to China during that time. However, it is generally believed that the two men had preliminary talks and that subsequent talks will continue in Peiping.</p>
<p>American Alumni Luncheon</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai from Chongqing, American Ambassador to China, Dr. Johnson, at noon yesterday, accepted an invitation from the American Alumni Association to attend its "Monthly Luncheon." Acting Consul Lockhart, who had just arrived in Shanghai from Peiping, was present to accompany him. Others in attendance included Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol, Colonel Fegen, Commander of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment, and former president of the association, Hamel. The current chairman, Major Betts, delivered a welcoming speech. After the meeting, the Ambassador returned to the Cathay Hotel to rest.</p>
<p>Kato Reveals China's Determination to Resist</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, Kato visited British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr to inquire about his impressions of his trip to Chongqing. In a conversation with Japanese reporters, he stated, "Regarding the current situation in Chongqing, it is said to be quite resilient and there is no consideration of peace..." This proves that China is determined to resist until victory is achieved.</p>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," Kato may continue talks with the British and Italian Ambassadors in Shanghai before heading north in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Took Ship Last Night to Qinhuangdao</p>
<p>Johnson was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 24th, but he has now changed his plans and took another ship, the Josephine Justsen, belonging to the Kailan Mining Administration, to Qinhuangdao last night. After arriving, Johnson will stay briefly and is expected to arrive in Peiping before Christmas to reunite with his family.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Japan Sends Kenji Kodama to Shanghai to Intensify Economic Aggression, Attempting to Encompass China's Wealth to Reverse Domestic Economic Decline <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Since Japan launched its war of aggression against China, its economic panic has become increasingly acute. In order to rescue its collapsing situation, it is actively carrying out aggressive activities in China and excluding the interests of various countries in China. Recently, in order to strengthen control over the economy of Central China, the Japanese government has sent Kenji Kodama to Shanghai to discuss "economic cooperation" with the "new government." Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japan's Economy at the End of Its Rope</p>
<p>Japan is a country with scarce resources and its economic strength was originally very fragile. Since the warlords launched the war of aggression against China, due to the huge war expenditures, the country has been issuing public bonds and levying heavy taxes, exhausting all means of exploitation. This has caused industry and commerce to slump and the people to complain. Recently, with the expansion of the war zone and the deeper involvement, the economic situation has become increasingly desperate. At this moment, before the total collapse arrives, in order to make a final struggle to reverse the crisis, it has no choice but to carry out a further aggressive effort in the occupied areas of China.</p>
<p>Kodama Returns to Shanghai for Further Activities</p>
<p>Kenji Kodama is a Japanese business tycoon and a well-known economic aggressor. Before the August 13th Incident, he came to China under the guise of "Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation" to organize the "Sino-Japanese Economic Association." After the outbreak of the war, the association became virtually defunct, and Kodama then proceeded to organize the "Central China Development Corporation" to carry out aggressive activities. In December of last year, he was sent to China by the Japanese government to conspire to undermine Chinese finances, but because China's financial foundation was solid, the attempt ultimately failed, and he returned to Japan. It is now learned that Kenji Kodama was dispatched again for the second time and arrived in Shanghai on the "Taiyo Maru" at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday (21st), landing at the Huishan Wharf in Hongkou and staying at the Broadway Mansions near the Garden Bridge.</p>
<p>Attempting to Intensify Economic Aggression</p>
<p>According to inquiries made by a Da Guang News Agency reporter with foreigners, Kenji Kodama's main purpose this time is to discuss a concrete plan for "Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation" with the "new central government" that is being planned and established. At the same time, he will strengthen the "Central China Development Corporation" and actively carry out further aggressive activities, attempting to encompass China's wealth to supplement its domestic poverty and reverse the trend of economic collapse. It is said that after a brief stay in Shanghai, he will also go to Nanjing and various parts of Central China to inspect and arrange his new plundering plan.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Exports of National Cotton Fabrics Gradually Decline; Inconvenient Transportation and Increased Freight Costs; Decreased by One-Third Compared to Last Year <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, Chinese industrial and commercial circles have been constantly working hard to research and develop various domestically produced daily necessities, and the quality and designs are all above standard, comparable to imported goods. Therefore, the import trade figures of the customs have also gradually declined, while exports have increased year by year, with the largest sales volume to the Nanyang area, where overseas Chinese account for the vast majority. Cotton fabrics are also a major commodity sold to South China and the Nanyang Islands. Before the war, due to smooth transportation, sales increased daily. After the war, transportation was obstructed, resulting in fewer South China merchants coming to Shanghai to purchase goods. Various manufacturers have been trying to find ways to maintain the transportation to prevent the market from being interrupted. Since the outbreak of the European war, transportation has become historically difficult, and freight costs have increased several times. Overseas Chinese also respect frugality and are eager to raise donations to contribute to their motherland. Therefore, everything related to daily necessities is simplified. According to a survey of the industry, the export of cotton fabrics to Nanyang this year is less than two-thirds of the previous year.</p>

<p>Today is the American Thanksgiving holiday, and Americans around the world will celebrate it warmly. More than 800 Americans in this city are scheduled to hold a commemoration at the British Church on Jiujiang Road from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM today, led by Mrs. Macdonald, chairwoman of the Thanksgiving Society. American Judge Hamid, and American Consul Lockhart, acting in place of Gauss, will read President Roosevelt's Thanksgiving Proclamation in public. Other women's groups will also hold separate ceremonies. The content of the Thanksgiving Proclamation is said to be a blessing for the health and happiness of Americans, and a hope for the arrival of peace in 1940. The American Thanksgiving holiday is the last Thursday of November each year, commemorating the winter of 1620 when a group of British immigrants first landed in Plymouth Bay in America, creating a British colonial territory on the North American continent.</p>

<p>According to the "North-China Daily News," it was learned yesterday (21st) that Colonel Fegen, commander of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai, has received orders from the U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters in Washington to return home after serving for a little over a year. He will depart for the United States on the President Grant on December 6th with his wife. It is expected that after Colonel Fegen leaves Shanghai, Lieutenant Colonel Murray, the executive officer of the Fourth Marine Regiment, will temporarily serve as commander until Colonel Baker arrives. Colonel Baker has been ordered to come to Shanghai in January next year to take over as commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment. Colonel Fegen is well-known among foreigners and in the sports community in this city.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Puppet Police Dissatisfied with Treatment; Many Have Recently Deserted and Fled; At Least Eight Cases This Week; Foreigners Reported the Matter Yesterday Morning <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Since the puppet municipal government decided to infringe on the police power of the Shanghai Western Roads Extra-Settlement Area, it has dispatched a large number of puppet police to patrol the roads, forcibly occupying positions and managing traffic. According to puppet propaganda, there are already 3,000 puppet police in Western Shanghai. Although this is actually an exaggeration, the number is not small. However, the "remuneration" received by these puppet police is extremely meager, only 16 yuan per month per person. At this time of high prices and high cost of living, it is difficult to maintain life. Moreover, the puppet police who have intruded into the roads outside the settlement are standing side by side with the Chinese police of the concession, and their uniforms and equipment are very different. Therefore, most of the puppet police are tired of this "job", and no less than hundreds of them have "deserted" and fled. According to foreign sources, at least eight puppet police on the roads outside the settlement have fled this week, and one of them occurred yesterday morning, witnessed by a foreigner, Mr. Kern. Mr. Kern lives at No. 3, Lane 310, Yanping Road. When he got up at 7:30 yesterday morning, he suddenly saw a rifle and a police cap in the garden, and was very surprised. He put on his clothes and went into the garden to investigate carefully, and saw three bullets in the barrel of the rifle, and a puppet police mark on the cap. He then realized that another puppet police officer had abandoned his gun and fled.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Rice Prices May Return to Normal; Management Committee Reorders Merchants to Register; Large Quantities of National Rice and Tribute Rice to Arrive Soon <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The previous surge in rice prices in this city was entirely caused by speculators manipulating for profit. Therefore, once the various groups strictly suppressed them, and the rice industry vigorously prevented short selling and buying, the price of rice plummeted. According to statistics, the price of rice has fallen by more than five yuan in the past three days, and it fell by about half a yuan yesterday. Powerful groups and influential people in this city are discussing a proper method to prevent rice prices from going off track again and promote their continued decline. It is expected that a new method will be implemented within a few days. After that, rice prices in this city should be able to eliminate unreasonable conditions and eliminate social hidden worries.</p>
<p>Management Committee Orders Merchants to Register</p>
<p>The Rice Market Management Committee had previously stipulated that all merchants who trade in the market must register in advance. This method, once implemented, has two effective points: (1) There is statistics to check, which can prevent short selling and buying. (2) When disputes occur in transactions, this registration can be used as a basis for mediation. However, some merchants are deliberately unwilling to register and trade in the market. Therefore, the Management Committee yesterday reordered all merchants to register in advance before they can sell or buy in the market. Otherwise, if there is a dispute during the transaction, in addition to not mediating, they will also be severely punished.</p>
<p>Suichang National Rice Has Already Been Shipped</p>
<p>Recently, 7,000 to 8,000 bags of national rice are transported to the rice market every day. The transfer certificates for various japonica and indica rice from Wuhu, Changshu, Jiaxing, Changzhou, Songjiang and other rice-producing areas to Shanghai by trucks have also been arranged for the second time. It is reported that a large batch of indica rice will be transported to Shanghai in the near future, transported from North and South ports such as Kunshan. Currently, the price of rice in Wuxi is 17 yuan per stone, and 19 yuan in Changshu. The first batch of 20,000 stones has been shipped out by Sino-Japanese merchants in half for sales.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Tribute Rice to Arrive Soon</p>
<p>The various rice firms in this city have jointly entrusted the French company, Dufaure, to telegraph Saigon to order a huge amount of foreign rice, a total of 24,000 bags, which is 2,400 tons. All transactions have been telegraphed and completed, loaded and shipped. It is scheduled to arrive in early next month (December). The selling price is 30 yuan and 6 jiao, calculated at 198 catties, which is 5 or 6 yuan lower than the current highest price of white rice (national rice). Once this batch of tribute rice arrives and participates in market transactions, rice prices in Shanghai will continue to fall. It is reported that various rice firms are currently in contact to make a second order to increase the stock of rice in Shanghai.</p>

<p>According to the English-language "China Press," Chief Inspector Bowen of the Public Concession Police stated to reporters this morning (22nd) that the two Chinese detectives of the Police Department currently detained by the Japanese authorities are expected to be released soon.</p>
<p>Bureau's Negotiations Have Not Been Replied</p>
<p>According to "Yu Lin Bao," Inspector Aggerborg of the Public Concession Police Department, along with two Chinese detectives and one female inspector, conducted an inspection on Rue Robert last Sunday and were arrested by Japanese military police. Aggerborg and the female inspector were released on the same day, but the two Chinese detectives were still detained. Chief Inspector Bowen of the Police Department has sent a letter to Major General Miura, commander of the Japanese Military Police in Shanghai, requesting the release of the two Chinese detectives, and the Municipal Council also negotiated with the Japanese Consulate General yesterday. The nature of the negotiations has not been disclosed, and it has not been possible to find out whether a formal protest has been sent out. The "Shanghai Times" also stated that the protests made by Chief Inspector Bowen of the Police Department and the Municipal Council to Major General Miura, commander of the Japanese Military Police, and the Japanese Consulate General, respectively, had not been replied to yesterday (21st).</p>
<p>Puppet "Mayor" Forbids Arrest of Foreigners</p>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," "Mayor of Shanghai" Fu Xiaoan has issued an order instructing the police of the "Municipal Government" not to arrest foreigners. In the event of a serious accident, the nationality of the foreigner should be determined and handed over to the authorities of their own country for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Restrictions on Remittances from British Malaya Have Been Changed <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Since the governments of various regions in British Malaya implemented restrictions on remittances and imports, the remittances of overseas Chinese in Nanyang to their home country and the export of domestic agricultural and industrial goods have been greatly affected. The Chinese Consulate General in Singapore has repeatedly negotiated with the British Straits Settlements government. It is now learned that the British government has changed its approach to the remittances of overseas Chinese and adopted a more lenient approach. The maximum amount of remittance allowed for each overseas Chinese per time has been extended to 500 Straits dollars. According to the current rate, 15 Straits dollars and 7 jiao and 5 fen can be converted into 100 legal tender, and 54 Straits dollars can be converted into 100 Hong Kong dollars. In addition, the remittance of various disaster relief funds raised by overseas Chinese groups and individuals to their home country is not restricted and is given generous accommodation. As for the cancellation of restrictions on the import of goods, it is still being negotiated. After the war, overseas Chinese in Nanyang are enthusiastically promoting the use of domestic goods. If restricted, it will have a significant impact on the domestic goods industry.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Most of the Exchange Equalization Fund's Foreign Exchange Has Been Recovered; The Market's Demand for Foreign Exchange Has Decreased Sharply; Japanese Merchants' Buying and Selling Steps Are Not Consistent <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The black market foreign exchange in Shanghai has gone from tight to loose. This change was largely initiated by Hong Kong, which helped legal tender. Due to the exchange restrictions in the British territory, they sold off English currency on the Shanghai market on a large scale. In addition, remittances from the Straits Settlements were also substantial, with the same motivation. Indochina and Manila also made considerable contributions, which was due to commercial needs. Local merchants, in view of the changing financial market environment, gradually recalled their initial trust in legal tender, believing that the time to recover legal tender had matured. If they did not do so now, they would regret it too late.</p>
<p>The Exchange Equalization Committee Replenishes the Fund</p>
<p>After the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee tried its best to stabilize foreign exchange in various parts of the country, although it did not maintain the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai on the surface, it actually valued it and made use of the opportunity to recover most of the previously consumed foreign exchange in order to replenish the foreign exchange fund. When it was supplied in the past, the price was around eight and a half pence. Now on the Shanghai market, the association is in the position of buyer. It is heard that this month, it has been constantly absorbing foreign exchange at 5 pence 4375, 46875, and 5 and a half pence.</p>
<p>Trade Improves, Demand Decreases</p>
<p>Since the ban on the import and re-export of luxury goods and non-essential goods to non-occupied areas, foreign trade has improved, and Shanghai Customs has turned into a surplus. Importers in the Shanghai black market foreign exchange have to reduce their demand for foreign exchange. Speculators, in view of the increasingly loose trend of foreign exchange, and the fact that the Equalization Committee's absorption of foreign exchange cannot be explored, the steps of Japanese merchants' banks are also inconsistent. There are both buyers and sellers. The Yokohama Specie Bank is in the position of buyer, while other Japanese banks are mostly sellers. Therefore, those who purchase foreign exchange are cautious. The loose market situation is not accidental.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Gangsters Hide in Western Shanghai; Robberies Double <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Last month, the Police Department of the Municipal Council handled a total of 2,673 criminal cases, an increase of 202 cases compared to September. At the same time, 2,439 criminals were arrested. In addition, there were 176 criminals who committed crimes in the previous months, and 29 criminals arrested on behalf of the authorities outside the border were also quickly arrested. A total of 49 people committed crimes using firearms, and 15 firearms, along with a large number of ammunition, were seized. Among the major crimes recorded, there were eight murders, seven attempted murders, two homicides, and 87 armed robberies. The number of robberies occurring in "B" police district more than doubled compared to September, which was obviously caused by gangs of gangsters hiding in the roads outside the Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Area. The police reserve team has been dispatched twice in succession. The cause of the incident was gunfire fighting.</p>

<p>According to people from Ningbo, the Ningbo market has become very prosperous due to the smooth navigation and frequent passenger traffic. The hotel industry is ten times more prosperous than in the past. Shops are also open for business as usual during the day. Banks, which were originally scheduled to start operating at 6:00 PM, have now opened earlier at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. Most residents still live in rural areas because of the convenient transportation between the city and the countryside, so they go out early and return late on weekdays. Air raid warnings are posted everywhere.</p>

<p>German goods purchased by Chinese merchants in Haiphong before September 3rd. Since the Haiphong Chinese Chamber of Commerce sent people to Shanghai to negotiate a visa plan with the French Consul General in Shanghai, the Vietnamese government can still transport goods purchased before the war in October. However, the relevant parties are urged to complete the visa procedures at the French Consulate and send them to Haiphong for picking up and shipping. A reporter from "New Voice News Agency" learned from the Sino-French Express Transportation Company that the French Consulate General in Shanghai has set the deadline for handling visas at 5 PM on the 24th of this month. The owners are urged to complete the visa before this date. Regarding the joint transport of goods on the Shanghai-Kunming line, transporting from Shanghai to Saigon and transferring to Kunming takes only 20 days. Last month, several sections of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway were destroyed by mountain floods, and the train service was suspended, causing cargo transportation to be blocked.

<h3 id="e58">Sixteen German Ships on the Far East Sea; Thirteen in Shanghai and Kobe, Three in Dalian; More Than a Thousand Crew Members Have Nothing to Do <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>According to the "Continental News," after the outbreak of the European war on September 3, German ships on the Far East sea ventured to avoid British and French warships and sailed to neutral ports for shelter. No German ships in the Pacific were captured by the Allied countries. Today, there are a total of thirteen German ships in Shanghai, Kobe, and Dalian, with approximately 910 crew members. They only clean the ships, keep them clean, and listen to radio messages from their home country. Among these thirteen German ships</p>
<p>Anchored in Shanghai</p>
<p>Only the cargo ship Ramses of the Henningsen &amp; Co. According to Henningsen &amp; Co. personnel, the Ramses is a relatively new ship, weighing 7,983 tons, built in Flensburg, Germany, in 1926. The 57 crew members of the ship are still getting paid, but most of them are paid by the relatives of the crew members at the Henningsen &amp; Co. domestic office.</p>
<p>Currently Docked in Kobe</p>
<p>There are three ships each from Henningsen &amp; Co. and North German Lloyd, and one from Rickmers Line. Among them, North German Lloyd's Scharnhorst is the largest German ship that has taken shelter in neutral ports in the Far East. The ship weighs 18,184 tons, was built in 1935, and has a crew of 270. Also docked in Kobe is</p>
<p>North German Lloyd's</p>
<p>Albert, with a crew of fifty, and Leichtenfels, with a crew of sixty. Henningsen &amp; Co.'s three ships are Cormoran, Markenfels, and Burgenland, each with a crew of 50 or 60. The three ships of the North German Lloyd that are taking shelter in Dalian are the cargo ships Fulda (7,744 tons), Augsburg (6,512 tons), and Bremenhaven (5,355 tons).</p>
<p>Henningsen &amp; Co.'s</p>
<p>Two ships, the cargo ships Saarland (6,725 tons) and Hohenfels (7,974 tons). The crew members of these German ships are receiving assistance from local German expatriates in Shanghai, Kobe, and Dalian, and their lives are quite comfortable. They all want to return home to serve, but the shipping companies need them to take care of the ships so that they can resume trade immediately when the war ends. The cargo carried by these thirteen ships has almost all been returned to the shippers.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Songkou Dredging Lost, Huangpu River Navigation Difficult, Swire and Jinliyuan Wharf Shoals Extend, Large Vessels Unable to Enter and Exit at Low Tide at Songkou <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Since November 13th of the year before last, when the Chinese army moved from western Shanghai, the northern and southern urban areas have been occupied by the Japanese army. All public and private property has been seized at will, and more than ten large and small dredgers of the Customs River Dredging Bureau have also been seized by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>As a result, dredging work within the Huangpu River cannot be carried out. It has been two and a half years now, causing the riverbank shoals to gradually extend into the river. Therefore, at the Swire Wharf, Jinliyuan Wharf, and other places, larger ocean-going vessels cannot easily dock at low tide, and those that have docked are also at risk of</p>
<p>being stranded.</p>
<p>It was previously heard that the River Dredging Bureau had repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese authorities, but to no avail. The bureau had ordered a new type of large dredger in the United States before the outbreak of the war, specializing in dredging the Shentan and shallow sands outside the Wusongkou. The large dredger was also among those seized. Therefore, in the Yangtze River area outside Wusongkou, there are also many places where sand and mud have risen on the riverbed. According to the shipping industry,</p>
<p>Outside Wusongkou,</p>
<p>at Black Pouet, the water depth was more than forty feet at low tide. Due to years of neglect in dredging, it is now only more than twenty-nine feet at low tide. Therefore, mail ships with a draft of more than thirty feet must wait until high tide to pass through this area. If the shallow sand in this area is not dredged again, navigation may become more difficult.</p>

<p>Regarding the climate in this port, it was very hot the day before yesterday because a low pressure system passed through north of Shanghai. According to news from the Observatory yesterday, the low pressure system has passed Shanghai and entered the sea between Korea and Japan, at a location of 34 degrees north latitude and 127 degrees east longitude. It is continuing to advance northeast. Because the low pressure system passed through Shanghai, the climate was disturbed. The temperature at 9:00 AM yesterday was 55 degrees, while it was 65 degrees the day before yesterday. The lowest temperature before 3:00 PM was only 52 degrees. It is also learned that the high pressure system in Siberia, Russia, has a tendency to advance towards northern China, so the weather in Pingjin and other places is extremely cold. This port will also be affected.</p>

<p>Since the Jiaojiang River in Haimen, Zhejiang, was blockaded by the authorities, shipping has long been suspended. However, the Zhejiang Provincial Government recently reported that dozens of sailing ships are operating on the Shanghai-Taiwan route along the coast of Taizhou, eastern Zhejiang. They secretly transport tung oil and other goods from Taizhou for export, falsely claiming to be "sailing to Ningbo," but actually sailing to Shanghai. The goods they transport back are all prohibited by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, such as kerosene, white sugar, and cloth, which are secretly sold in the inland areas. This kind of illegal trafficking should be investigated and prohibited as soon as possible. Telegrams have been sent to the Wenzhou-Taizhou Garrison Headquarters to instruct all counties to quickly and strictly investigate and secretly prohibit it.</p>

<p>The German national, Hai Maina Lanya, 44 years old, residing at No. 36, Lane 225, Fair Road, used to run a cloth shop in Berlin. Two years ago, he fell in love with a female employee of the shop, Ya Benhai Meisi (also German). In February of this year, Ya also fell in love with a compatriot, Fa Senhua Tuo, and got married. In March, they traveled together from Germany to Italy and took a ship to Shanghai. However, when Ya boarded the ship, she had an argument with Fa and used a long-distance telephone to notify Hai Maina Lanya, saying that she still loved Hai. Hai rushed to Shanghai by ship. Ya followed Fa to Shanghai and rented a house at No. 2, Lane 915, Avenue Joffre. Unexpectedly, the feelings between the two sexes suddenly broke down again, and Fa rented another house in Hongkou. Ya then fell in love with another man. In May, Hai Maina Lanya arrived in Shanghai. Ya entertained him on the first night and they stayed together. Later, Hai repeatedly asked Ya if she was willing to marry him, but did not receive a satisfactory answer. Hai, heartbroken, wrote a letter of "dying together" and hid it in his pocket. On the morning of June 12, he carried a razor and broke into Ya's bedroom, cutting her throat and killing her on the spot. At the same time, he stabbed his own wrist with a knife, hoping to commit suicide, but failed. He was arrested and prosecuted by the Second Special Court for murder. Judge Liao sentenced him to twelve years in prison. Hai refused to accept the sentence and hired lawyers Lu Dingxiong, etc., to appeal to the High Third Branch Court, arguing that he admitted the murder but had realized his past mistakes and requested a lighter sentence. Judge Wu, together with Assessors Chen and Gu, opened a court to hear the case. The judgment was made yesterday afternoon, overturning the original sentence in the case of Hai Maina Lanya's murder and changing the sentence to eight years of imprisonment.</p>

Han reported to the nearby Chinese police and telegraphed the General Patrol Room. Detective Yang Peisheng and Detective Yan Rui immediately rushed to intercept them. At that time, a thief was fleeing towards Jiujiang Road. Seeing that the detectives had arrived, he avoided entering the corpse inside No. 69 Jiujiang Road, but was eventually searched and captured by the detectives. A pistol was found and taken back to the police station. He confessed that his name was Chen Qunhe, from Wuxi, 20 years old. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao-yi explained the process, stating that this case still needs to investigate accomplices and investigate the stolen money, so he requested permission to postpone the date.

<p>Liu Rongfu, a shareholder of Xie Xing Dyeing Workshop at No. 44, Ji Jia Lane, Dapuqiao, and his wife, Liu Zhao, have recently been sued for joint injury in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court by Liu Gu, Liu's concubine (30 years old and from the same village as Liu), who hired lawyer Yu Xiufang, requesting legal investigation. According to the statement, in 1934, the first defendant learned that the plaintiff had some savings, and seduced her in every possible way, saying that his wife was still vacant and that he was willing to marry the plaintiff as his wife, which led to adultery. After living together, he deceived all of the plaintiff's savings under the pretext of jointly opening a shop. In April of last year, the first defendant's wife, the second defendant, came to Shanghai, and the plaintiff realized that she had been deceived. The first defendant repeatedly and earnestly persuaded her, and the plaintiff had no choice but to endure it and retreat to the position of concubine. Unexpectedly, the second defendant was fierce and shrewish, and repeatedly instigated the first defendant to abuse the plaintiff jointly. On the 1st and 3rd of last month, they repeatedly beat the plaintiff, causing injuries. In addition to requesting an injury examination, she sued for legal investigation. According to the statement, the court opened a court yesterday morning to summon them for questioning by Judge Huang Yan. The defendants refused to accept the summons because the plaintiff had made a mistake in the original statement, claiming that their last name was Li, so only the plaintiff and her lawyer were present. After a brief interrogation in court, the plaintiff's agent lawyer was ordered to correct the defendant's surname in court, and then a date was set to summon the defendants to court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Han Jinhua, 48 years old, from Ningbo, the legal representative of Taichangxiang Shipping Company at No. 6, Jiqing Lane, Sanyang Jingqiao, recently entrusted lawyers Jiang Yiping, Li Gengxiang, Yang Yunshi, and Ge Bang to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against Zeng Bingsen (also manager), Zeng Yiping, Huang Ruhao, Dai Wenlin, Chen Shaoji, Yao Rongyuan (also assistant manager), Zeng Nianci, Liu Nianhua, Zeng Jizhi (also chief accountant), Chen Wenzeng, Liu Zirong, and Yao Shumin, twelve shareholders of Tong Sheng Company, for breaching the</p>
<p>ship lease contract,</p>
<p>requesting a judgment for compensation for damages. According to the general meaning of the complaint, Tong Sheng Company, jointly established by the first to eleventh defendants, previously sub-leased the Norwegian merchant ship Randi to the plaintiff through the twelfth defendant as an intermediary, with a fixed monthly rent of 887 pounds and 10 shillings, for a period of twelve months from the date of delivery. The lease was signed on March 17 of this year, and the above-mentioned ship was delivered in accordance with the lease at 6:00 AM on April 11. However, not long after, Tong Sheng Company suddenly sent letters on June 10, 23, and 29, claiming that because the company shareholders</p>
<p>had lost all their money,</p>
<p>they requested to terminate the lease and refused to pay the rent. The plaintiff, considering the matter to be a breach of the lease, immediately entrusted a lawyer to negotiate repeatedly. The company suddenly declared bankruptcy, and the manager and responsible persons disappeared. The plaintiff was forced to plead with the Norwegian shipowner repeatedly before being understood, and the plaintiff paid the shipowner 1,250 pounds in damages and a commission of 5,000 national currency as a settlement. It was found that the above-mentioned damages and expenses incurred due to the termination of the contract, together with the plaintiff's profits for ten months at 87 pounds and 10 shillings per month,</p>
<p>totaled</p>
<p>943 pounds, 12 shillings, and 6 pence, and 75,365 yuan and 0.01 yuan in national currency, which should be jointly and severally liable for by the shareholders of the company according to law. It was also found that the twelfth defendant, as the contract intermediary, received a huge reward of more than 1,000 yuan per month, and should bear full responsibility for this. It should be ordered that the defendants jointly and severally compensate the plaintiff 943 pounds, 12 shillings, and 6 pence, and 75,365 yuan and 0.01 yuan in national currency, and a 5% per annum</p>
<p>statutory interest</p>
<p>from the date of the lawsuit until the date of execution, and bear the litigation costs. According to the statement, the court opened the fourth court yesterday afternoon by Judge Chen Can to hear the case. The plaintiff was represented by lawyer Jiang Yiping and stated the facts and reasons for the lawsuit, as well as the object of the judgment. Some of the defendants were represented by lawyers Ma Shouhua, Su Fuchou, and Cai Rudong, who appeared in court and presented their defenses. The court also summoned a witness for questioning. The two lawyers debated fiercely for an hour. As a result, because the whereabouts of Liu Zirong, one of the defendants, were unknown, he had to be served by public announcement. There were also those who did not appear in court. The court then adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Finance, Frequent Rumors of Good News, Gold Prices Soar, Tianjin and Hong Kong Gangs Still Have Strong Appetite, Gradually Creating the Highest Closing Price <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's dark market situation for spot gold followed the foreign exchange market closely. Therefore, the overall situation was first flat and then rose. The buying momentum gradually expanded. Since it was reported that the Soviets and Japanese had started commercial negotiations, speculators had another opportunity to profit. All kinds of empty rumors spread, foreign exchange was tight, and the Tianjin and Hong Kong gangs still had a strong appetite. Market prices rose and it was difficult to fall back. People's hearts in all parties were unanimously upward. Although the securities gang, Defu, sold out in one go halfway, it was ultimately because Baokang's recent appetite was particularly strong. By the afternoon, the highest price even broke through the 3,700 yuan mark. Yesterday's process was as follows: the opening price in the morning was 3,650 yuan, which was no different from the previous day. Later, a certain money exchange industry sold out, and the securities gang, Defu, frequently came to dump goods, so it fell slightly at this time, twice falling to a low of 3,648 yuan. However, soon after, it was heard that the foreign exchange market was reporting soft, and people's hearts were stirred up. The money exchange industry, Baokang, and Tiancheng took the lead in purchasing, and the money exchange industry that had previously sold out also came back in force. The trend was unusually stable, rising by as much as 20 yuan. However, the securities gang came up with a new trick and continued to sell, and another money exchange industry turned to hedging, pressing down a small ten yuan. However, at noon, the buying momentum rose again. A certain silver shop, on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, and a certain silver firm and a certain gold firm, on behalf of the local gang, joined forces to absorb goods. Moreover, because the foreign exchange market also continued to report soft, the closing price was raised to 3,675 yuan. In the afternoon, it suddenly became tense. The opening price was 3,680 yuan. Then, rumors confused the public, and the buying momentum expanded. A certain money exchange industry and Baokang actually entered another 700 taels of goods in force, surprisingly raising the price to 3,704 yuan. It was the highest closing price of the day. As a result, it soared 54 yuan compared to the previous day. The trading volume for the whole day was quite strong, with 2,500 to 2,600 taels. The price of gold ornaments in silver shops increased by 5 yuan, while the price of customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>The price of spot gold exceeds the 700 yuan mark. From the beginning of the day, the situation for each bar (ten taels) was stable. Initially, the money exchange industry, Qiantai, sold ten taels to a gold firm for 3,650 yuan, which was the same as the previous day. After a while, it was pressed down by two yuan. A certain money exchange industry sold another twenty taels to the same industry for 3,648 yuan. Later, the money exchange industry raised the price by seven yuan by receiving goods on behalf of customers. The money exchange industry entered ten taels for the silver shop gang and thirty taels for the securities gang, all for 3,655 yuan. At that time, the securities gang continued to sell more than one hundred taels, pressing it down to a low of 3,648 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange market reported soft, and people's hearts were slightly encouraged. A certain money exchange industry turned from selling to buying, soaring seven yuan in an instant. Later, because a certain gold firm also followed suit, and sellers were scarce for a while, it rose by another thirteen yuan. A certain money exchange industry entered thirty taels for the cash firm for 3,668 yuan. Then, because the securities gang revived the selling momentum, and a certain money exchange industry and a certain firm also came to sell, it fell back by ten yuan. The securities gang sold twenty taels to the money exchange industry for 3,658 yuan. Near noon, the buying momentum resumed. A certain silver shop absorbed goods in the front, and a certain silver firm and a certain gold firm followed suit, and the buying momentum was boosted by the continued softness of the foreign exchange market, so it rose by another seventeen yuan. A certain gold firm entered thirty taels for the securities gang for 3,675 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, due to frequent rumors of good news, people's hearts were optimistic, and the opening price was five yuan higher. The silver shop gang entered ten taels for the gold firm for 3,680 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange industry aggressively entered more than two hundred taels, continuing to rise. Soon after, it rose another sixteen yuan. A certain money exchange industry entered thirty taels for the securities gang for 3,696 yuan. After that, a certain gold firm made a profit and sold, so it fell back by a small eight yuan. A certain gold firm sold thirty taels to the money exchange industry for 3,688 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange industry suddenly came to enter several hundred taels again. Although the silver shop gang and retail investors took the opportunity to sell, the positions were still insufficient, and the sellers' asking prices were quite high, so it broke through the 3,700 yuan mark. The gold firm entered twenty taels for the money exchange industry for 3,704 yuan. After that, a certain money exchange industry stopped buying for a while, so it fell back by four yuan. The money exchange industry did ten taels mutually for 3,700 yuan. Near the evening closing time, a certain money exchange industry purchased dozens of taels again, rising by four yuan. A certain money exchange industry entered twenty taels for the silver shop gang for 3,704 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it soared 54 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by 56 yuan for the whole day. The selling price of the cash firm's own brand of gold was 10 yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the purchase price was reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current standard gold price was 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed gold price, but there were few transactions.</p>
<p>The price of gold ornaments increased in the afternoon. The initial exchange price of silver shop gold per tael was still 370 yuan at Datonghang. At 2:05 PM, it increased by five yuan. As a result, Datonghang changed to 375 yuan. The new counterparts had the same price as above, and the purchase prices were reduced by 15 to 20 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, demand for foreign currencies, including British and American gold pounds, recovered strongly, and market prices were firm. British and American gold notes were expensive. The price of US dollar notes rose to $11.72 in the morning and continued to be strong in the afternoon, closing at $11.78 in the evening. Hong Kong dollar notes were slightly firm due to the tightening of the Hong Kong exchange rate. French franc notes and Annam dollar notes were in strong demand, and market prices rose steadily.

<h3 id="e79">Sassoon and Company Profitably Settle Foreign Exchange <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: the HSBC exchange rate listing was announced and remained unchanged. The unofficial British and American exchange market was only open for half a day, and the situation became increasingly quiet. Most operators were taking a wait-and-see approach, but those who expected a decline were also not determined to enter the market to buy, so the fluctuations remained narrow. At the opening, because the American and British exchange rate returned to 75 points higher, the opening market showed a sign of British tightness and American stability. The British gold rate was 5 pence 296875, and the American exchange rate was $8.6875, with a very stable trend. Until after 9:30, Sassoon, a Western merchant, suddenly came to the market to buy in, and Company Profitably also had an appetite for purchases. Moreover, it was reported that the Soviet Union and Japan had begun negotiations on a commercial treaty, so the trend suddenly became tighter. In addition, importers also successively settled their foreign exchange purchases, and HSBC's appetite for absorption was not lagging behind others, so the exchange rate gradually decreased without turning back until the midday close. The British gold rate was only 5 pence 25, and the American exchange rate was only $8.59375, which was 0.0625 tighter for British gold and 0.09375 softer for American currency compared to the previous day. It was reported that the futures market situation was completely similar to the spot market.</p>
<p>The results all showed tightening.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, London's large bars were flat for both near and far terms. New York silver prices also remained stable. London's raw gold remained unchanged. The exchange rates of British currency against American currency and against French currency were both flat, rising by 0.0625 against Shanghai currency. The American currency rose by 75 points against British currency, remained unchanged against Shanghai currency, and rose by 0.0625 against French currency. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling prices in the morning were 5 pence 296875 for British gold and $8.6875 for the American exchange rate, which was slightly 0.015625 tighter for British gold compared to the previous day, while the American currency did not change. This was due to the increase in HSBC's listed exchange rate. After the opening, the market situation was quiet and flat, and transactions were also rare. When HSBC's listed exchange rate was announced without change, and the silver balance tax was also announced without any increase or decrease, Sassoon suddenly came to absorb purchases, and Company Profitably also had a slight appetite, so the situation slightly softened. Sassoon and Company Profitably bought spot American exchange rate at $8.65625 and $8.625 from a certain bank. Later, Sassoon also purchased spot British gold at 5 pence 28125 from a foreign bank. Subsequently, importers also followed suit to settle foreign exchange, and HSBC also absorbed a little, leading to a continued tightening and softening of the trend. A foreign firm settled spot American exchange rate at $8.59375 with a certain bank, and HSBC absorbed spot British gold at 5 pence 26525 from Wah Bi. By noon, the bank's spot selling prices at midday close were only 5 pence 25 for British gold and $8.59375 for the American exchange rate. The December British gold rate was 5 pence 1875, and the American exchange rate was $8.46875. As a result, the current and forward British gold rates were 0.0625 tighter, and the American exchange rates were 0.09375 softer compared to the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Unstable</p>

<h3 id="e82">Securities: Rumors Abound; Public Bonds Weak; Foreign Stocks Firm and Rise on the Other Hand <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The securities grey market situation yesterday: After hovering in a weak state several times, the market gradually rose and fell. This trend may not be stopped for a while. This has been repeatedly stated in this newspaper. Because the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union is getting closer, Britain and France are making concessions to Japan, and the North Sea war is becoming more and more intense, making the future more difficult to deal with. Empty words come from nowhere, and market rumors take the opportunity to rise up. Fortunately, many parties were still able to exert their remaining strength to pull up the market, otherwise the fall would have been more than this. Most of the players on the surface were shorting, but some bulls emerged, so the Class A and Class C bonds suddenly broke through $7. Although there are some fluctuations in the future, it is difficult to be optimistic about the trend. At the beginning of the morning yesterday, No. 41 bought in, and Song Mao followed suit, which can be called the mainstay of the moment. Unfortunately, few people sympathized. Dasheng suddenly released a large number of bulls, and the trend relaxed, and people's hearts were suddenly scattered. Lianhe and Yongkang both sold off considerable amounts, and the market price suddenly broke through the $7 level. Retail investors were still buying in small amounts. In the afternoon, No. 41 still had the power to buy in. Tiansheng, Datong, and Hongkang also had to buy, while Shengda Lianhe continued to sell. No. 38 and Yizhong also sold off, and the market price continued to weaken. The bulls pulled up the market again at the close, but the effect was minimal. The market price uniformly fell by a small amount of 3.5 cents to 7 cents. The turnover was about one million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Qingfeng Yarn Factory were traded at a price of $46 each.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market of the Public Industry Association was extremely firm and lively. Jardine Matheson shares and Steel shares all reached peaks of $70, $23.50, and $15.20 respectively. The transaction price of China Business Corporation bonds was $88, which was slightly firmer than before, while the stock transaction price was only 58 cents, which was 10 cents lower than before. This is evidence that the public has paid attention to and distinguished the truth, which is gratifying. In terms of rubber stocks, the Langezhi stock was the most pleasing, with a price of $22.75 at the close, and there was no shortage of purchases. (Note: The delivery date of the Public Industry Association will be changed. For details, please refer to the announcement on the cover of the association today.)</p>
<p>London, 21st telegram. The London Stock Exchange was closed today.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Yarn and Cotton: Foreign Cotton Difficult to Ease; Japanese Factories Plan to Use Fire Machines <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The cotton trade is still not weak. The appetite of Chinese and foreign factories is gradually expanding. This is because there is no hope for a decline in the overseas cotton market, and it is more cost-effective to purchase local cotton. At the same time, the market price of yarn and thread has increased a step compared to the past. Therefore, although the factories are not searching for large quantities, they have changed their style and are not as dull as before. The selling price is therefore slowly increasing. Japanese factories, both domestic and foreign, which have been stagnant for a long time, have also purchased 1,000 bales. At present, because the source of cotton from northern Jiangsu has not been cut off, people's hearts are still calm. However, judging from the situation of foreign cotton, the foundation of the cotton market will not be shaken. 1,415 bales of Tonghua cotton, 469 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 1,690 bales of Beisha cotton arrived at the dock. The current cotton situation is listed on the left. (The price of the factory is the price delivered to the factory including baking water. The transaction price of the industry is the dock delivery price.)</p>
<p>Tonghua Cotton</p>
<p>$135.00 $135.50 $136.00</p>
<p>Industry Purchases</p>
<p>600 bales</p>

<p>$147.35</p>
<p>Anhui Purchases</p>
<p>500 bales</p>
<p>Another report on foreign cotton market prices: when New York cotton cloth opened in the morning, cotton prices continued to rise due to purchases by the industry. Telegrams from Liverpool and Bombay skyrocketed. Later, prices fell due to profit-taking by some bulls. As a result, the closing price fell by 1 to 7 pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market was like a raging fire. Yesterday, including forecasts, it rose another 11 rupees. Egyptian cotton fell by more than 10 pounds, and Liverpool rose by more than 20 pence.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton trade, all parties have stated in recent days that overseas cotton markets have risen for many days and prices are too high, so the desire to purchase is very weak. Factories are very quiet. The industry has also seen few spot transactions, so some have switched to trading in New York American cotton futures, and transactions are very busy. At the beginning of next month, a large amount of American cotton will arrive at the port. The factory delivered price including tax, converted at an exchange rate of $8.625 for the US dollar, is as follows:</p>
<p>20s American Middling: $166.60</p>
<p>20s American Middling, Lower Grade: $160.60</p>
<p>32s American Middling: $172.80</p>
<p>32s American Middling, Lower Grade: $165.10</p>
<p>42s American Middling: $175.90</p>
<p>42s American Middling, Lower Grade: $166.60</p>
<h3 id="e84">Large Yarn Market Holders Eager to Sell <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which rose sharply the previous day, entered a stable and quiet path yesterday. This is because wholesale sales have not developed in retail sales, and large holders of goods are very willing to sell goods for cash when market prices rise, resulting in a loose trend. However, overseas cotton markets are still firm and rising, and the rise in Indian cotton is very dramatic, increasing factory costs. Therefore, some are taking the intention of buying in at low prices. From this point of view, the foundation of the yarn market may not fall greatly for the time being, but the actual demand is still too sluggish.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened in the morning, continuing the momentum of the previous day, rising another 4 or 5 yuan. The spot price of 20s Shuangma yarn in foreign warehouses was $646-7, but all were transactions within the same industry. Hong Kong merchants still lacked excitement and did not purchase in large quantities. As for retail merchants eating a few bales of coarse yarn, there were still very few fine yarns. After the industry ate their fill, they stopped buying, and suddenly there was a decline of several yuan. The closing price of 20s Shuangma was $643, which was not much different from the previous day. Other brands were still firm, and coarse yarn was rising. Factories did not take action. The amount purchased by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 135 Industry: 600</p>
<p>Fuzhou: 80 Ningbo: 30</p>
<p>Jiangxi: 120 Xiamen: 10</p>
<p>Inland: 15 Tianjin: 50</p>
<p>Previous Day's Transactions: 865 Total: 1905</p>
<h3 id="e85">Food: Retailers Are Likely to Bring Rice Prices on Par with Superior Rice <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of rice and grain for each group was slightly scarce due to continuous rain. More than 3,000 bags of goods from Suzhou, Jiaxing, Kunshan, Taicang, and Fengxian arrived. Because the midday market had tightened once the previous day, there was still residual energy in the morning, and there were continued calls for higher prices. However, the sales market in the local area was not smooth, and the hoarding households saw that the situation was not good and sought to sell their goods. Supply exceeded demand. As a result, whether it was superior rice or retail rice, prices were stable and soft, with a decrease of 40 to 50 cents. In short, the market has shown a state of hovering after a major decline. Statistics show that the city's total transactions were more than 6,000 bags.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the retail glutinous rice arrivals were still continuous. Although there were no large batches coming to Shanghai, small batches in transit arrived continuously. In the morning market, the market price increased once due to the low prices and eagerness of the shopkeepers and hoarders to purchase. However, the price of retail glutinous rice was more expensive than the thick rice at $32.50, and actual sales finally did not dare to purchase smoothly, so the market turned flat again in the later market. The total number of arrivals and sales throughout the day was nearly 3,000 bags.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice was not formally traded in two batches that had been agreed upon because foreign exchange was not settled on Wednesday. Chinese and foreign merchants were still peddling. The selling prices varied. One said that the production price had risen, and Saigon No. 1 had to be continuously priced at $35.40, which was more than $0.20 more expensive. Another said that futures could be reordered for only $34.60, but at present, the booking and handling were unified, and the later market could continue to be transported.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Flour and Wheat Remain Firm <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot flour transactions were active. Merchants from Beiyang (Yantai, Qingdao) and Nanyang (Hong Kong, Xiamen) all had intentions to purchase. However, because raw material prices are currently expensive and production has decreased, all factories are becoming increasingly tight in their sales intentions. All wholesale transactions were restricted. It was reported that the price of the Paoche brand flour had risen from $7.30 to $7.40. Although the book price of the Bingshuan brand was still $7.20, the merchant price was no longer supplied. There were few returned goods supplied and demanded. Affected by the decline in rice prices, the warehouse and merchant prices were not very poor. The total market traded nearly 5,000 bags. The market was clearly stable and secretly firm.</p>
<p>Wheat</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market was also trending upward. This was because there were currently few arrivals and few stored goods, and those holding goods were thinking of storing them in warehouses to wait for prices to rise. The demand from factories and warehouses was also not urgent. After the market was once squeezed the day before yesterday, formal transactions began yesterday. Changzhou wheat opened at more than $11.30, and all other goods rose by 10 to 20 cents. It was reported that foreign wheat may gradually become accessible. Once the source is open, the future of domestic wheat will be significantly affected.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Soybeans Solid and Stable <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the yellow soybean market situation has been such that arrivals have not been smooth under rumors that there will be control in the production area. People's hearts are optimistic. The market price has risen by more than 50 cents compared to last week. At present, arrivals and storage are not strong, so the standing price is still solid and stable. Yesterday, the Hong Kong merchants purchased more than 300 bags of Chongmingsha yellow soybeans, priced at $14.50 to $14.55. Other transactions on the street included 500 to 600 bags of Wuhu soybeans, priced at $13.75 to $13.90, 300 bags of Dingjiazhou soybeans, priced at $13.90, and 200 bags of Nanjing soybeans, priced at $13.60. 120 bags of soybeans were shipped from Beisha yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Sugar Market: Jinjiang Sugar Prices High and Unprecedented <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The national sugar market was still active yesterday. Jian merchants continued to open 250 bags of diaoqing at $33.50, and the merchants of Jue opened more than 200 bags at $33.20. Chao merchants opened more than 300 bags of high-quality huanggangqing at $36. According to Jinjiang, sugar prices are high and unprecedented. White sugar is as high as more than $90, and brown sugar has also reached more than $70. It is impossible for it to come to Shanghai. The trend of the association's cleared dishes is stable. The old goods of No. 24 coarse white sugar in foreign warehouses are $51.50, and the new goods are $52. Taikoo Che Bai B-Mark Dong Warehouse is $55, and the West Warehouse is $55.50. The rest is according to the refund. Dutch red sugar is $41 to $41.50. The local cotton white and No. 1 ice are all priced at the original price, with not much change.</p>
<h3 id="e89">North and South Goods: Honey Dates Decline <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Recently, honey dates have continued to arrive from time to time, and destocking has been rare, showing a situation of supply exceeding demand. Prices have declined. Yesterday's market price was $110 for Huigong bald heads, $100 for Lanxi bald heads, and $90 for ordinary ones, which was nearly $10 lower than before.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Silk and Tea: Local Silk Exports Suddenly Rise <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, the Shanghai market situation has been stable following the rise in Japanese and American silk prices. White factories have continued to receive purchase orders from American merchants. Yesterday, because overseas market prices uniformly declined, the atmosphere in this port also turned dull. The appetite for American Zhuang purchases was weak. Factory selling prices remained stable. The Shanghai silk inventory was not very large. Yesterday, Dachang imported 10 to 20 dan, priced at $4,150. The Philippine exports, which have been lacking in improvement for a long time, suddenly started buying yellow local silk yesterday, purchasing 30 dan of goods from Mianyang and Huangzhou, priced at $1,020. At this time of quiet local silk trading, the offered price was still not bad.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Piece Goods: East Piece Goods and North Sales Active; National Cloth Factory Prices Increased <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>National cloth factory prices increased. Merchants in the local area and national households are thinking about rising prices, and the buying style is slightly stronger. The turnover of fine cloth, fine twill, satin, grey cloth, fine yarn Qianfu silk grey cloth in this month and next month is very large. The market price has turned firm. Colored cloth, colored twill, fine cloth, and fine twill have each risen by 10 to 20 cents per piece. Yihuo coarse cloth of light and heavy pounds has each risen by 5 cents to 10 cents per piece. Yongwen merchants handle more than 100 bags of various grades of coarse cloth. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants handle 70 to 80 bags of fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth. More than 100 cases of flannel, colored cloth, and colored twill. Fujian merchants handle more than 4,000 pieces of colored twill and Shilin bamboo cloth. Merchants from northern Jiangsu and Wuhu handle several thousand pieces of colored cloth and other goods.</p>
<p>East piece fine cloth and fine twill fell back after rising. The morning market situation was quite soft. The low price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth fell to $18.20 per piece. Later, because the northern merchants and the local street purchases were still strong, more than 700 pieces of white goods were traded. The selling price in the later market recovered, and the spot price of Longtou was $18.40, and the fine twill was $17.60, but it was still 20 to 25 cents per piece lower than the previous day's high point. Merchants did not open goods, so according to industry observations, the market atmosphere was quite stable.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Hardware: Iron Billets and Local Nails Weak <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Black iron billets are purchased by mirror factories, thermos factories, iron printing factories, printing factories, etc. There is a large number of stocks on the market, and overseas orders are continuously loaded, such as Yihuo, Baolong, Lianyi, Guanhua, Lihe, Hanli, and other foreign firms continue to supply. Due to the congestion of spot goods, the price of 200-pound goods is $75-76 per box, and the price of 2,000-pound goods is about $800 per piece, which is about one-tenth lower than in the past.</p>
<p>Local nails are mainly purchased by the local construction industry. Recently, because the work done is not prosperous, the price has fallen again and again, from $50 to $47, and then to $45. Yesterday, the market only sold $42-43.</p>

<p>(Special dispatch from Chongqing) Jiangsu Provincial Commercial College was formerly known as Jiangsu Provincial Bank College. The school site was originally in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the school moved to Hunan to resume classes and was approved by the Ministry of Education to be renamed "Jiangsu Provincial Commercial College." Now, the Ministry of Education, in order to cultivate accounting and commercial talents to meet the needs of the country, has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for approval to change it to national status in the 28th year. The school has also established a Cooperative Finance Department and plans to continue recruiting new students once in Chongqing.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Secretary of Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Mr. Gao Bozhen Dies <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Gao Bozhen was a native of Wujin, Jiangsu. He graduated from Jiangsu Public Law and Politics University. He passed the trial of undertaking review and was appointed to Taixing. After arriving at his post for nine months, he made clear and fair judgments, and the scholars and people praised him. He then returned to teach at Wujin County Women's Normal School and served as a standing member of the county party headquarters for many years, and also held local public office. In the 20th year, the central government convened a national conference and was elected as a representative of Jiangsu. During the Anti-Japanese War, he presided over the salvation work in Changzhou. Everything from the supply of military needs to the organization and training of the masses was properly deployed. In the autumn of the 27th year, Ma Yuanfang was appointed as the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, and Mr. Gao was appointed as the secretary. Over the past year, Jiangsu's education, in this extraordinary period, has progressed in an orderly manner and has been painstakingly managed. Mr. Gao's contribution to governance cannot be erased. On October 16th of this year, he was ordered to go to Shanghai to participate in a certain meeting. Unfortunately, the Xin Taikoo Maru he was on sank off the mouth of Wusong due to wind and he died in the disaster. He was only thirty-six years old when he died. He left behind an elderly mother, a widowed wife, and four children. Because he had always been honest and self-disciplined throughout his life, his funeral was unusually bleak. All matters related to the aftermath are being handled by various friends in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e97">The Western Youth Basketball Tournament of This Year: Twenty Chinese and Western Teams Participate in the Competition; Chinese Teams Account for Three-Fourths of All Teams <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The registration for the 12th Western Youth Invitational Basketball Tournament closed the day before yesterday. That evening, the committee convened and approved all twelve Group A teams and eight Group B teams that had registered. Yesterday, Mr. Bratou, the sports director of the association, officially announced the list. Group A was originally set to have eleven teams, but now has one more. The Paramount team, a strong Chinese team and the runner-up of the previous tournament, surprisingly gave up joining. The Aurora College team, which finished fourth last year, has moved down to Group B. The Ponpei team was excluded due to late registration. This year, the McKlings will participate with three teams. In addition to the McKling Red, the champion of the previous tournament, the McKling Military will also regroup. The McKling Gold will be replaced by the McKling White. New teams include the emerging strong Chinese team, the Shanghai Youth, and the China One, the overall champion of the Central Youth Group B in the previous tournament. In addition, there are a total of eight Chinese teams, including the China Union, Friendship Union, Tianxing, Moore, Xu Fang, and Blue Black, accounting for two-thirds of the total. They are determined to compete with the McKlings. The Western Youth Little Bear team is considered to have mediocre skills and not worthy of much attention. In Group B, Chinese teams account for seven of the eight teams, with only the Giant team being Western. Except for the Aurora College team, all are new to this year's tournament. Teams such as the Shangxing Cloud and Guangshi are very strong and will surely dominate. The tournament is scheduled to open on the 5th of next month. Both Group A and Group B will adopt a single round-robin system. Group A will have a total of sixty-six matches, and Group B will have twenty-eight matches. For Group A, three matches will be held every Monday and Friday starting at 7:15 pm, and two matches will be held every Wednesday starting at 8:15 pm. For Group B, one match will be held every Wednesday starting at 7:15 pm, and three matches will be held every Saturday starting at 3:15 pm.

<h3 id="e100">Third Act of the Central Youth Basketball Tournament: Ponpei vs. Xu Fang Tonight; Friendship Union Meets Blue Black in Another Match <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The third act of the Central Youth Basketball Tournament features two Group A matches tonight. In the Central Division, Friendship Union will face Blue Black. Friendship Union boasts strong players such as Lu Gusui, Zhou Yaokang, Shen Ji'en, and Lu Shungen, making them a very strong team. Although Blue Black's Ma Fangcui and Tao Zunan were once prominent players, they are now old. And Zhuang Youren, a famous soccer player, is better with his feet than with his hands. Therefore, Friendship Union can confidently win. In the Youth Division, Ponpei will meet Xu Fang. Ponpei is more of an exhibition team and does not count for points. Many of its players are veterans of the basketball scene, such as Zhang Wenyuan, Wang Shoufang, and Li Feiyun, who are still strong. Team captain Qian Xucang is also intelligent and brave, so they should not be underestimated. Xu Fang, under the leadership of Dong Xiaopei, has players such as Lu Dazhen, Tao Shaosheng, and Zhang Jinxiang, who are all top choices of their time. Tan Dahua is making a comeback, which is noteworthy. Ponpei will likely have a hard time winning, but may be able to outsmart their opponents. Considering the strength of both teams, Xu Fang is more likely to win. In Group B, Qianghua and Jizhong are expected to win. Also, the Aurora College team has officially withdrawn from Group A, and in Group B, Nanguang has changed its name to Pangdui, and Xiaoguang has changed its name to Guangming. Tickets for tonight's games are still sold at 30 cents (non-members) and 20 cents (members).</p>

<h3 id="e103">The Motive Power of Emotion <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>When we listen to several people play the same piece of music, with fixed rhythms and words, it illustrates the different emotions of each person. It's not just music; in any art form, the content must be entrusted to the form, and the form will inevitably be influenced by it. The external form may be the same, but you cannot ignore its internal motive power. When the surging internal motive power generates its own waves, it is the hidden difference accumulated inside. Even if you cannot distinguish it from the outside, you can still choose its soul from the core of things. Emotion and music are no different. It's the same emotion; you are angry, and so is he; you admire, and so does he. However, there is a big difference between them. It's not just the depth of the degree, but more importantly, the origin of the emotion.</p>
<p>The existence of emotion lies in the human heart, and it is inevitably subjective. However, when you investigate further, you find that people construct a psychological change, through the coincidence of physiological and psychological factors, from nothing to create a state. In that instant, it is a vague and amorphous mental retina. Before it is formed, in a very short and mysterious time, like a spider spinning silk, it pulls out thin, grayish-white strands. The way of spinning the silk, before forming a web, will indeed affect the future web. Usually, because this web is formed too quickly, you cannot distinguish its "management" and "existence," thinking that there is nothing but subjectivity. This view is wrong. I believe that the emergence of emotion in an instant can be regarded as an objective state. How you weave those spider's threads, the web is considered your creation. Every "emotional web" weaver weaves different webs, and these webs are their sustenance.</p>
<p>Ruskin, the author famous for "The King of the Golden River," analyzes the various aspects of emotion in detail in "Modern Painters." His main point is that emotions are divided into noble and base, and the nobility and baseness depend entirely on the cause of their "basis." If the cause is noble, then the emotion is also noble. The same is true for baseness. For example, admiration and resentment are not necessarily emotions he considers noble, but when one is resentful of being harmed exceptionally or admires the budding flower, these emotions are noble emotions. They are completely different from being resentful of having a small amount of money taken away or admiring fireworks and commodities. The so-called "basis of emotion" is actually a kind of motive power, the direction in which the spider spins the silk when weaving the web.</p>
<p>Emotion is an element in literary works, which is very obvious. But I don't know that there is another kind of motive power besides emotion. There are hidden emotions besides emotions. The same emotion contains different values. Who can deny Ruskin's words? The value of the same resentment and admiration is very different. Their value is not in external things (emotions) but in the essence (emotions other than emotions). The motive power of emotion controls emotion, which can be explained by Montaigne's words: "External things have color and taste because of the essence." This is not so much a distinction of emotions as it is honestly a distinction of essences. It's like the surface sound of the strings being the same, but what exists in the heart is different. When Guangwu Zhongxing, the people cheered with the same sentiment, "I never thought I would see the Han official ceremony again today!" is admiration. "Why are you so late?" is also admiration. "When will the sun perish? I will perish with you!" is anger. "If there is such a thing, I will follow you!" Wu Sangui's words on horseback were also anger. But the emotions between the two are very different in terms of sublimity and vulgarity.</p>
<p>The greatness or insignificance of the motive power of emotion will undoubtedly control the greatness of literary works. In this era, we can be considered uniquely blessed, with resentment and admiration, and these emotions hide great and sublime motive power behind them. Deep and serious injuries cause resentment, and the passion of light and caress causes our admiration, and these are also sublime emotions beyond emotions, definitely not the kind of emotions derived from the boring motive power of those greedy admirations and hatred of justice, which will never produce great literary works.

<h3 id="e104">Newspapers and Magazines in Yan'an <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Fen</p>
<p>Yan'an also has shops that specialize in selling magazines and bookstores that also sell magazines. If you step inside, you will be dazzled by a pile of colorful magazines and newspapers. In addition to a large portion coming from various places outside the area, there are quite a few that are published locally. And they are all able to stand on the front lines of the great era, leading the public and guiding those who are progressing. That's right: the lineup they display shows them to be so strong and healthy. In this group, it's hard to find anyone who is backward, loose, blind, or depressed. The lively but serious writing can really make people love and respect it when they have it in their hands. If readers want to know some of its "resume," let me introduce them one by one below!</p>
<p>"Liberation" is one of the earliest in the publishing world of Yan'an newspapers and magazines. It was born with the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. At first, it was a weekly, but later, due to the lack of paper, it was changed to an irregular publication. The organizer is the CPC Party Newspaper Committee. The content is mostly about the cultivation of party members, party theories, and reports. Mao Zedong, Chen Shaoyu (Wang Ming), Zhang Wentian (Lofu), Cheng Fangwu, and others often wrote here. It once wanted to move to Wuhan for publication, but it did not succeed. Due to distribution issues, it suffered several major disasters in Xi'an.</p>
<p>"New China Daily" is a small four-page newspaper that has been transformed from mimeograph to letterpress. The organizer is Mr. Chengzhi, the son of Mr. Liao Zhongkai. It is a local newspaper for conveying news to the Yan'an public. It is published every Tuesday and Friday. The supplement has no name and is the base for reporting literature in Yan'an. Writers once engaged in a pen war here over the issues of cities and villages. Comrade Mao Zedong came forward to mediate before they each stopped fighting.</p>
<p>"Unity" is a semi-monthly publication in the form of a single 16-page book. The organizer is the Border Region Government. The content is mostly similar to "Liberation Daily," but most of the manuscripts here are recorded from the lectures of the Shaanxi Northern Public School. Therefore, many students of the Shaanxi Northern Public School buy it. In addition, there are some local party and government news and other manuscripts.</p>
<p>"Chinese Youth" This is a semi-monthly publication in the form of a single 16-page book. Because the writers are all young partners, its content is absolutely lively. It's hot and energetic, with an invincible trend. Such as the history introduction of the International Youth Movement, the world youth character records, and the feature articles of young warriors active in the occupied areas are all valuable manuscripts. The organizer is the Chinese Youth Society.</p>
<p>"Chinese Women" The "Chinese Women" who do not wear high heels gave birth to it at the end of June this year, after taking some space and effort in the struggle of life. It is a monthly publication. The movement of the manuscripts is closely following the life problems of women in the War of Resistance and the introduction of women's work dynamics in various places. The organizer is the Chinese Women's Society.</p>
<p>In addition to these, there are also "wall newspapers." "Wall newspapers" in northern Shaanxi are as numerous as Shanghai's cigarette advertisements. They can be seen everywhere on every street. Even if you run to every institution, factory, and cooperative, you can also find their masterpieces on the walls. This is where they review their work and report their lives. Although schools such as Shaanxi Northern Public School, Anti-Japanese University, and Chinese Women's University, as well as larger institutions and organizations, print them in letterpress, the paper and transportation in Yan'an are difficult, and the price is expensive. Just take newsprint as an example: when Shanghai only sold two cents a sheet, it already sold for ten cents a sheet there. Now there's no need to mention it anymore. Even "Liberation Daily" and "New China Daily" have switched to printing on a kind of rougher Maobian paper. The lack of paper materials there can be imagined.</p>
<h3 id="e105">News <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Gongsun Seng</p>
<p>When the swallows fly south, the geese fly north, and the yellow leaves fill the ground in autumn, I began to settle down by a lake, constantly recalling the painful memories experienced in the distant borderlands. And I often looked out, in fact, I was yearning for the arrival of spring.</p>
<p>However, spring was hiding slowly, while autumn was gradually deepening. From the window of my humble residence, I saw the endless declining grass and the mirror-like lake without the sound of kingfishers. Even the shadows of the trees were gradually thinning. However, all sighs and sorrows are in vain, and autumn will not quietly slip away because it is hated.</p>
<p>At this time, a friend often sent me letters and comfort from a distant foreign country. Just as I had suffered for seeking spring, that friend was also forced to leave his own country for seeking spring. In my autumn-like days, thanks to him, I could often get some news about spring. If I had ever smiled at the lonely river or the still starry sky, then that laughter should have been given by him.</p>
<p>However, in autumn, even the wind and rain are dull and subtle. The lake water stagnates in the lake bed every night, with only ripples and no waves. The stars are nailed to the sky every night, with only faint light and no movement. I cannot see the harbinger of spring coming, nor can I find the traces of spring passing away.</p>
<p>However, one day, that friend told me a message, saying that there would be a meteor shower one night. At that time, I could see the jump of the stagnant stars and the churning of the calm lake.</p>
<p>That night, leaning against the window facing the water, I looked at the calm sky and lake, and I had a joyful heart. I seemed to feel that the meteor and the lake would give me news of spring.</p>
<p>But other than listening to the sound of insects and the sound of wind all night, until dawn, they still did not change this stagnant scene. In the time I wandered in front of the window, I had resented that friend.</p>
<p>But on that very night, gunfire rang out in a city not far away. In the morning, when the people in the streets told me the news, they had excited smiles. Then, I suddenly realized that the meteor and the lake had really moved that night, and spring had definitely come suddenly in the bleak autumn air without any news. I was ashamed of the resentment I had had, and my friend had not deceived me, but had used another way to report to me the news of that "spring."</p>
<p>After that, I hurriedly left this lonely lake. Now that I knew the whereabouts of spring and had seen the coming of spring, then why should I stay in that environment that is forever autumn? Just like the swallows flying south to seek warmth and the geese flying north to avoid the cold, I made myself a person seeking "spring" who is heading towards spring.</p>
<p>I left in such a hurry.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Vitality <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Bingquan</p>
<p>A bright and clear autumn morning.</p>
<p>I jumped into the fresh air; I stepped on the dew-covered mud with brave and broad steps;... The cool and emerald-green breath made me very happy.</p>
<p>Opposite me was a cluster of ancient and twisted trees. The sun shone its light on this side and that side, and also on the green-leafed dome; dewdrops glistened on it... forming a golden, shimmering sea of light. I was amazed by the beauty woven by nature. Several yellow leaves hung weakly on the intricate branches, which must be the footprints left by autumn.</p>
<p>A subtle insect sound drifted from the distant side, perhaps tired, lazily lying into my ear and slowly dying away. Although it is so weak, it is the cry of life! The severe winter of death is lying in front, and the season that is so cruel that it will not allow even a single blade of grass to survive will come. These lives will be threatened by the devil's hand of death; but I believe that they will grow up in the struggle. One day, they will be strong and spread their high-pitched and majestic songs proudly across the earth.</p>
<p>I have a joy and comfort in life; I have received a new inspiration, and I have a newborn hope for everything.</p>
<p>I gazed at the distant sky; I took a deep breath; as if I were a warrior going to the struggle.</p>
<p>Spring will follow winter, I thought.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Mei Lanfang's Russian Female Disciple <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Huazhi</p>
<p>Dr. Mei Lanfang has a Russian female disciple named Siavina Brown. It is said that Mei met her during his visit to the Soviet Union several years ago. Ms. Brown is the wife of a Russian painter named Brown. She is very young and talented, and her mother was a famous actress during the Tsarist era of Russia. She has a family tradition of learning. Brown has studied drama and dance since she was a child, integrating the classical dances of various Eastern countries such as China, Korea, and India, and evolving them. She claims that when she first saw Mr. Mei, "the chief priest of the Chinese art world," perform sword dance several years ago, she expressed her fascination and joined his school. She began to learn skills and felt that the fun of the whole set of singing and dancing in Peking opera was far more comparable to ordinary multi-scene operas. After learning the secret, she set up her own school and created her own style, permeating the monotonous oriental colors with a strong Western taste. She has traveled around for many years and has gained a good reputation. Brown and her sister Nina Du Nan recently went to the United States to sell their art, performing dramas, operas, and dances. When they passed through Yokohama, they also gave a public performance at the local International Women's Club. According to the talk, "Recently, she has melted various dance arts of China, Tibet, Mongolia, Korea, and Japan into one furnace, and can cater to the taste of any audience. As for the sword dance technique, it completely follows the Mei style." According to foreign women who love Peking opera, there was once a German named Jung-chu, and now there is Brown. If what she said is true, she is another strong general of the Mei school.</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Madness of New York Women: Clark Gable's Magic for Women <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Lin Gong, from "American Film Intelligence: Anecdotes of Movie Stars"</p>
<p>Clark Gable, after much difficulty, finally obtained permission from his company for a two-month vacation in the warm spring. He seized this excellent opportunity to travel around with his wife, but because his charm was too great for women, women flocked to him like bees and butterflies wherever he went, which annoyed him greatly. As a result, he secretly took a detour from New York back to Hollywood before even three weeks of vacation had passed.</p>
<p>When he was invited to perform on stage at the Randle Grand Theater, the women, upon hearing the news, were so excited that they jumped around like madwomen, pushing and shoving into the theater as if fighting. After each performance, they lingered reluctantly, and had to be forcibly driven out by theater staff. When Clark Gable was leaving or returning to the theater, countless women surrounded him at the theater entrance, cheering and shouting, pulling at his coat, shirt, and tie, snatching his hat, and grabbing his gloves. Each wanted to bravely squeeze closer to him, hoping to get a lock of his hair or a shred of his clothing as a souvenir. As a result, Clark's clothes were often torn to shreds, and he was so annoyed that he almost cried.</p>
<p>The next day, Clark Gable was terrified. He hid in the dressing room backstage at the theater, from noon until evening, but more than five thousand women crowded at the door waiting to see him. They even broke through the police cordon, and with the force of thousands of jade arms crashing against it, they finally broke down the backstage door of the theater. However, they did not find their ideal lover. Later, word spread that he was hiding in the locked dressing room, and only then did some of them gradually disperse.</p>
<p>On the third day, Clark Gable, feeling too stuffy from being cooped up in the room, went to the window for some air. He was immediately spotted by a girl, who rushed out from the crowd, risking danger, and climbed out from a small room near the furnace. They were willing to exchange their lives for his autograph, which, though foolish, showed the extent of his charm.</p>
<p>The theater was always packed, making the owner so happy that he couldn't close his mouth. He even requested that the number of performances be increased from twice a day to six times a day. Clark finally couldn't take it anymore, so he took his wife secretly on a late, quiet night, took the train and sneaked back.</p>
<p>"New York is like this, I never imagined. I lost five pounds in weight in three days. Walking on the streets of Hollywood is not surprising at all, but New York was such a sensation," Clark Gable often said to his friends.</p>
<p>According to general critics, "The reason Clark Gable has such a magical power to attract women is because he is full of male sensuality, and can be called a 'hot man'."</p>
<p>Truly, Clark Gable is a living treasure to women!</p>

<p>The contract between the Shanghai Drama Society and the Xuan Palace Theater will expire on the sixth of next month. Both the front and back stages are considering whether to renew it after it expires. If it is not renewed, then "Taking Oneself as an Example" following "A Regret from the Late Ming Dynasty" will be the last play performed by the Shanghai Drama Society in this period.</p>
<p>On New Year's Day of the 29th year, a new spoken drama theater will be established in Shanghai, and the person in charge is actively preparing for it. If time permits, it may open as early as Christmas. The address is in the most central area of ​​the "isolated island."</p>
<p>After Chen Kengran completed "Women's Apartment," it was once rumored that he would direct "Du Shiniang" for Guohua. According to recent news, there is a possibility of renewing the contract with Yihua, but it is still a "per-film" deal, with a director's fee of 1,500 yuan per film.</p>
<p>Luo Ping's "Chen Yuanyuan" has recently been written, and the first act was submitted the day before yesterday. It will probably be performed in the spring of next year. The performance rights belong to the Shanghai Drama Society.</p>
<p>Yihua Company's "Wang Baochuan," which was produced with all its strength, will be screened at the Greater Shanghai Theater starting tomorrow. According to friends who have seen the test screening, there are several shots of Zhang Cuihong that are very beautiful and quite in line with the demeanor of "Eastern beauty."</p>
<p>Li Ying left Yihua and joined Hezong. Some people said: It is exactly "A horse has left the boundary of Xiliang..." because he played Xue Pinggui in "Wang Baochuan."</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held a chrysanthemum exhibition on the seventh floor of the New New Company, displaying more than 6,000 pots of precious chrysanthemums, in a riot of colors, which was quite spectacular. It is now scheduled to hold a charity sale of movie stars this Saturday, and there will definitely be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e110">New Stage Information <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Zhang Eyun will succeed Wang Yurong on the golden stage. The supporting roles include the young male actor Ye Sheng Lan, the old male actors An Shuyuan and Guan Shengxi, the martial actor Zhang Yunxi, the painted face Liu Lianrong, and the clown Ma Fulu. The lineup is neat, which can be seen at a glance, until the end of the season.</p>
<p>— Man</p>
<p>Wu Suqiu decided to perform until the expiration date of the 26th and will no longer continue. Starting on the 27th, there will be four days of charity performances for the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. The newly invited second phase of equal-status actors has been confirmed to take the Shengjing ship south on the 27th. The entire cast includes Kun Dan Zheng Bingru, Xu Sheng Guan Dayuan, civil and military old male actors Li Hongchun, Jing actor Liu Yanting, young male actor Zhang Lianchang, old male actor Song Yuchun, clown Li Qingshan, Chen Zhihua, Jing actor Jin Shaochen, martial clown Yin Jinzhen, etc. Among the old team of the first phase, several people were also retained, and official matters are being negotiated. Guan Dayuan once traveled east to Japan with Dr. Mei Lanfang and performed in Japan. He has been away from the Shanghai music scene for a long time. He has now been recruited by Xin Xin, and we are very happy to have obtained him. With these three pillars, Xin Xin's future is promising.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>North and South Each Have an Honoree</p>
<p>Even with the vast and profound skills of Wang and Yang, old Tan saw them as merely the best among the ordinary, which shows how high his standards were. Unexpectedly, after his death, Yang and Wang each enjoyed great fame. One became a leader among the martial actors, with a reputation for being unprecedented and unsurpassed; the other was revered as the Lord of All Knowledge, the Great Dharma Master, not only serving as the chief among the female actors, but also able to create new styles, arrange old plays that had been lost for a long time, impart them to his students, and make them public to the world. His contribution to promoting Peking opera is rarely seen among actors in ancient and modern times. He and Xiao Lou not only lived up to Old Tan's earnest expectations, but also each achieved a lofty reputation as the leading figure in their respective fields. If Tan knew this in the afterlife, he could rejoice that his old eyes were not mistaken. Yao Qing, because he had never left Beijing, was able to interact with scholars and celebrities from time to time. He had deeply studied bronze inscriptions, calligraphy, and painting, and was especially good at painting chrysanthemums, hence the nickname "Chrysanthemum Obsessed." He had a large collection of Han jade, and his keen eye was admired by antique dealers in Beijing. I often went to his residence in the evening to chat. He was gentle and refined, and his conversation was lively. His extensive knowledge of opera was astonishing, and his appreciation of antiques made him one of the leading artists in the pear garden.</p>
<p>In terms of learning, although Debao was not as good as Yaoqing, Ruiling's extensive knowledge of opera, being able to do both civil and military roles, Kunqu opera and various other genres, was almost comparable to Wang's. Rui was humble and amiable. Because his family had many old scripts from the Sanqing Troupe, he often selected and read them in his spare time. Whenever he encountered something difficult to understand, he always consulted with learned scholars. He would not stop until he fully understood it. However, he was ultimately old-fashioned and superstitious. Two things he said were quite laughable. (147)</p>
