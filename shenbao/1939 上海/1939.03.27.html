<p>社評</p>
<h3>德日與青島</h3>
<p>昨日忽傳日本德意志國間，忽爾觸及膠州灣島問題此國際演變萬狀，舉軼常軌之時，此類傳說，未可僅以其不合常情常理而漠視之。爰請申述觀感</p>
<p>消息來源，自英京敦，德京柏林。傳之者，有英國之路透社，法國之哈斯，社德國之海通社。所傳性質，或稱日本此餽贈，主動在日；德國提出此要求，主動在德。據聞日人意在結好德國，以各國將殖民地交還德國之倡；更聞日人擬於英法交還德國舊屬後，仍由德國將膠州灣交日本。據聞德人所顧慮者，惟恐此舉之與中德友誼不相應。或論其事，謂此在軍上之意義較諸經濟上之意義為允重云。</p>
<p>青島在五千年之中國歷史中，始終屬於中國版圖，純屬華民族生息地之一隅也；顧與德日二國，確亦曾各有其一度之短期故事。一九七年，德國以德籍敎士二人在華遇害，遂佔青島。一八九八年，清廷與德國訂的以斷送之；此為德國據有膠澳，經營島，窺伺山東之始。閱十載，至九一四年，日本對德宣戰，圍攻匝月而取之；於是德國不僅在島之心血悉付東流，資產盡日佔，即在遠東之唯一根據地亦自此剷滅。九二一年，中德復交，德國聲明放棄此項權益。一九二二年，中國收回之。一九三七年底，即八一三後四月餘，中國自毀青島而退，迄今年餘，在日軍控制中。往事若斯，史實如鐵，故其根本上主權屬於中國，絕無疑義；而軍事佔領僅為一時變態而不足動搖主權，尤為國際法之通則；故昨日外電或稱日本將以青島交還德國，或稱日本將以青島餽贈德國云云，謂「交還」，謂「餽贈」，皆文字上之錯誤；若果出此舉措，則其本質為盜送，為慷他人之而私相授受，是法理上之錯誤，是不足以對抗第三國者之無效行為也。</p>
<p>德國政府吾認此說，指為中傷之辭，意在激動反德情緒；德國不但未與日本談及此事，抑且未作此想云。如此表示，賢明之極；而所予世人以良好之印象，尤遠逾於膠澳島問題之範疇。蓋以德國在歐洲大陸之行動，一似德國乃悍然不顧一切，惟利是圖，無孔不入之國家，其客觀反應之嚴重如彼；而對此曾有淵源之軍事經濟根據地，能平心靜氣，顧及反德情緒，而聲明之鄭重若此；兩相比較，意義深長。且更可確鑿證明者，中德之間無論近年以德國方面對華之若干不友好行為，而使國交友誼漸見退，然兩國究為歷史悠遠交誼篤厚之友邦；在中國固不欲以德之袒日而遽敵視德國，在德國亦不以對日有所袒護而對華遂加欺壓侵損。由此分析，但須德國不再增進其日分量而使中國難堪，則中國抗議勝利之中德關係，必歸圓滿；是則見微知著，在此次德國之否認傳說而透露其端倪矣。</p>
<p>雖然，昨傳之青島問題，初不以德國之否認而便可目子虛。良以德國雖「未談此事，未作此想」，然本問題固別有其發動之可能。若彼外人之議論，以為「此在軍略上之意義，較諸經濟上之意義為允重」，此誠隔靴搔癢之談；蓋以「重在軍略」言之，德國之復興與擴展，迄今未嘗用，是豈有遠圖軍略於彈丸之青島之理？豈有用兵為日本門之理？豈有助日戰華之理豈有延長國防自分兵力之理？藉日對俄，又豈有繞道遠東之理？德國自知然，日本亦知其然；然則固與軍略無關，重在軍略云何哉？要知本問題之傳說而確有所本，則其意義百分之一百在於外交。惟在外交，故德國之所否認，儘可發動之於日本片面之痴願。</p>
<p>原來日本發動武力侵略後之國際政策，外因孤而陷於極端苦悶，內因意見紛雜而盲目掙扎。於是動之以小聰明出之以小手藝，到處試探求出路，詎知到處逢絕路，例如所謂新秩序也，新政權也，容許友好國家與日合作開發中國之宣示也，乃至如此次之青島問題也；是皆小聰蝗，小手藝也。及不能速戰速决，限於實力，而獨霸之新秩序無由樹立；傀儡祗是寄生而不夠號召，於是為之工具之新政權重失本意；英美法抗議之不已，於是假合作云云仍不能自掩其面目，德國否認青島問題之傳說，於是詭謀不效；是皆徵象絕路者也。云何青島問題包藏詭謀？慷他人之慨以媚德，謀得德國助力，如賒軍火之類，一也。以此答復關於關閉門戶獨吞中國之抗議，以表示其不關閉不獨吞，二也。示人以分贓之雅量，以減少侵略行為在國際所遭之磨阻，三也。誘致侵略之伙伴，四也。為侵略求分謗，五也。逐漸擴大戰爭漩渦，進謀死裏求生，退為獨敗解嘲，六也。惟此六者，故曰有其片面發動之可能。若德國所聲明之從未談論及此我人當然信任此項聲明；此則殆以日本惟恐此舉不足以餌德，顧又不甘埋沒此，小聰明小手藝，始先透露之於海外報界，以試探德國意嚮而自留進退虛實之餘地；此種試探方式固國際所慣見者也。</p>
<p>外交上之小聰明與小手藝，初未能欺罔國際政治家，徒以自暴其心勞日拙而已；顧有時而亦有其妙用焉。蓋钩心鬥角，爾詐我虞，有時明知其為一時之欺罔，然或利用其欺罔，而假作痴聾；或接受其欺而將錯就錯。例如日本於壟斷華北之外匯與貿易，已經布置就緒，不虞他國之入矣，於是宣告開放青島外港；於是故作暗示，其意謂此外諸地將漸次開放也。此種偷天換日。取珠還櫝之小手藝，雖三尺童子亦得覷破其欺罔。然安知無他國當局取為藉口，欺其國會議員，欺其工商各界，以表示其對日外交之成功，以諉棄其對華援助之義務？是以國際一切現象，無論其不合常情常理，甚至不合常識；苟有其十一百一或萬一之可能者，皆非吾人所可漠視者也</p>

<h3>墨索里尼演說　願維持長期和平　中歐變化乃無可避免之事德義樂與反獨裁陣綫周旋</h3>
<p>（羅馬）本日乃係法西斯黨廿週年紀念、墨索里尼首相頃在體育塲主持慶祝典禮、並向老黨員六萬人發表演說、各國使節均被邀參加、首相之言有曰、「本日盛會、適在歐洲時局緊張時舉行之、吾人所信守之原則、至爲明顯、在吾人視之職業的和平主義者誠屬可鄙、永久的和平誠足以釀成禍息、但吾人仍以爲保持歐洲文明、發揚而光大之、實有維持長時期和平之必要、惟有一層必須聲明者、即吾人所應享有之神聖的權利、一日不爲人所承認、則吾人即一日不能有所建樹、任何企圖、凡明削暗弱或毀滅羅馬柏林軸心爲目的者、終必歸於失敗、（聽衆均鼓掌、並高呼希特勒萬歲）、要知此項軸心、旣爲德義兩國睦誼所在、實爲兩種革命之結晶、吾人可明白聲明、中歐洲近日所發生之事變、乃係無可避免之事變、有一國焉、旣擁有强大之兵力、又有多數軍械與兵工廠、但外患之來、竟不知抵抗、余敢斷言、此一國家更換命運之時機、即已成熱、亦唯有聽其自然而已、另一方面言之、世人若果組成集團、以反抗各獨裁國、則各獨裁國不但樂與周旋、且當在各方面進行反攻</p>
<h3>對法僅提三項要求</h3>
<p>去歲余在熱諾亞港發表演說時、賞謂、法義兩國之間、有一障碍物、（指西班牙國而言、）時至今日、此項障碍物即將消滅、西班牙國國民軍部隊當在數日之內、甚或數小時之內、開入瑪德里城、共地一度被視爲法西斯主義之墳墓、孰知時異境遷、即將成爲鮑爾希維克主義之墳墓、舉凡吾人所為、幷不要求世界加以裁判、僅欲以所具見解、告知世界而已、吾國政府曾於去歲十二月十七日照會法國、而將各項懸案、坦白予以說明、其中涉及都尼西亞地方。直布底港。與蘇彝士運河者、均屬殖民地問題、法國政府對於此項問題、是吾應允加以討論、彼有充分之自由、固非吾人所得置喙、截至目下爲止、該國政府始終堅決表示反對、亦屬實情、但有一事予以注意者、即法義兩國間之鴻溝、若竟日益加深、馴致不易甚或不能填補、則法國政府不應怨及他人、法義兩國均係拉丁民族、保有血統關係、固矣、但吾人已不願再聞此言、綠國與國之間、一切當以武力爲根本、其所推行之政策、亦視武力之消長、以爲轉移故也、</p>
<h3>地中海與義國　生存攸關</h3>
<p>地中海無論在地理上在歷史上在政治上、在軍事上、實乃義國生存攸關之空間、吾人所謂地中海，當將亞德里亞海包括在內、斯拉夫族在亞德里亞海方面所保有之利益、吾人雖不必予以排斥、但義國所保有之利益、宜處於優越地位、此則世人所不可不知耳、</p>
<p>最後尚有一點、亦即最主要之一點、厥爲吾人必須擴充軍備、吾人之口號、厥乃用盡一切方法、不惜任何代價、必置有更多之大砲、更多之軍艦、更多之飛機、即使將文明生活之享受完全予以捐棄、亦所不計、凡人必須强有力、乃爲友人所敬愛、敵人所畏　、「弱者無告一、自古巳然、今亦猶昔、同志乎、吾人過去會戮力同心、從事奮鬬、今後尚當如是、義大利之利益與法西斯主義之利益、若果遭受妨害、吾人即當準備流血、加以保衛」、</p>
<p>至是、首相乃向聽衆發問曰、「汝等欲得榮譽·報酬·與舒適生活、寗有所不能乎」、聽衆大呼曰、「吾吾」、首相乃謂、「吾人之信條有三、（一）信仰、（二）服從、（三）奮鬬、一切勝利之關鍵、盡在於此」、本黨自秉政以還、凡所成就、雖已不勝屈指、但尚未全部完成、吾人在社會問題上、今方開始工作而已、各民洽國輒謂法西斯的義大利業已破產、業因對阿比西尼亞用兵而喪失力量、必須向英國舉債、始可圖存、凡此誣衊之詞、今已證明其不確、要之、吾人過去之成就、其性質固甚重要、但今後所應進行之工作、尤爲重耍、深信吾人必能完成之、余之歲志、百折不撓、汝等精神、亦甚活躍故也云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法方觀察　局勢未變</h3>
<p>（巴黎）義國首相墨索里尼本日晨間所發表之演說、頃由此間政界人士加以評論云、此公並未發出無可救藥之表示、法義兩國相互關係所遭過之困難、亦不因而愈益加重、此公旣以去歲渠在熱諾亞港所作演詞爲言、足見法義兩國各項懸案、在西班牙國內戰結束之前、實無解決之可能、關於此層、法國原有立塲、亦無所變更、質言之、蘇彝士運河之管理權與東菲洲法屬直布底港關係事項、均可提付討淪、但以法屬都尼西亞境內義國僑民所處地位而言　、法國除依照一九三五年法義兩國協定而外、殊無接受他項辦法之理由、此外、墨索里尼首相幷指出義國在地中海所當解決之問題、不以法義兩國懸案爲限、且謂義國當在亞德里亞海上處於優越地位、此言雖屬委婉究係警告德國、勿得對於特里哀斯脫港、（歐戰後曾由前奧國割讓義國、現已國爲自由港）、有所舉動、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英在兩年內　艦隊全部革新　主力艦共二十四艘</h3>
<p>（倫敦）路透海軍記者研究現有海軍造艦計畫及向消息靈通方面採訪後、獲知英國在兩年內將有全新海軍、內有大戰艦九艘、乃英國所造之最快主力艦、其中五艘、名喬治五世號·威爾斯親王號·的克公爵號·傑里柯海軍上將號·與裴蒂海軍上將號、各三萬五千噸、裝置十四吋口徑大砲、兩艘名獅號與勇號、各四萬噸、裝置十六吋口徑大砲、餘兩艘、名號未定、其噸位及砲口徑亦未悉、以意度之將與獅號相同、喬治五世號明年底可完成、威爾斯親王號將於五月三日在白根海下水、明年底亦可入隊、迨一九四一年春初、的克公爵號傑里柯號與裴蒂號（皆於一九三七年夏間動工、）亦可完工、上述五艘、大的各可載飛機四架、且置有防禦空變之設備、除此新戰艦九艘（其造價各約八百萬鎊）外、英海軍尚有現役大戰艦十二艘、巡洋戰艦三艘、故英國主力艦共有二十四艘之多、現役主力艦隸屬本部艦隊者、計有大戰艦五艘、巡洋戰艦三艘、其隸屬地中海艦隊者、共有七艘、現役主力艦若干艘、業已經過改造與刷新之工程、故等於最新式而具有强大戰鬥力之新艦（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<h3>希特勒再聲明　願為義國後盾</h3>
<p>（柏林）希特勒兀首頃因法西斯黨二十週年紀念、電達義相墨索里尼云、「義大利民族對於充滿惡意缺乏諒解者之陰謀、曾努力加以反抗、德國民族旣與貴國具有同樣理想、自願爲之後盾、」任何企圖、意在妨礙貴我兩國正當願望之正當發展者、德國民族均願協同貴國加以反抗、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）官方頃發表公報稱、德國元首希特勒拍致墨索里尼首相電、業田駙馬赫斯親王轉達云、接一年前德國兼併奧地利國後、希特勒元首會以一函經由赫斯親王送達首相、用以說明兼併理由、幷保障義國北部邊境勃倫納山隘不受侵犯、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>省府積極規劃　改良閩省特產</h3>
<p>機製茶葉已辦有成效</p>
<p>製糖事業正切實改良</p>
<p>福州通訊、閩省的主要農產輸出品、有茶葉．菸草．甘蔗．及水菓、茶葉在過去的輸出、每年多至以千萬元計、菸草富其極盛時、僅永定皮絲一項、每年有三四百萬元的產額、甘蔗為製糖的原料、在洋糖水入口以前，每年產銷國內達二百萬担以上、水菓中的桔．柚．荔枝．龍眼．橄欖，及花中的水仙．首利、每年運銷外地者、常達數百萬元、後來因外貨的競銷或代替、出口均見低减、年来閩省當局積極提倡生產、對於這些農產輸出品盡力改良、以謀復與茲將各項改進的經過情況、分述如下、該進茶葉　甲、茶葉、閩省政府為謀茶葉復興起見、除設置茶倉管理運銷，及舉辦茶葉檢騐割一品貨外，並於民國廿四年特在福安設立茶葉改良場，中置茶園、分平地山地兩部分，平地三十六畝、為各種試验區、舉行茶樹的各種栽培試騐，山地二百餘畝、為普通栽培茶園、此外附設有製茶工場、備置新式機械，計有發動機、揉捻機．解塊機、篩分機、及乾燥機等設備、於廿六年開始製茶、為閩省新式機械製茶的首創、是年出品八十一箱、得價最高者每百斤七十五兩、超出福安一般茶價二十兩、廿七年原擬製造八十箱，聞以種種原因、僅製成二十八箱、然其品實如條索香味等項、都比以前進步，由省茶葉管理處運銷香港、每百市斤得價港幣一百三十元、破福安壽甯諸縣茶價的最高紀綠、製茶改良、可謂已獲初步的效果、至於茶葉技術底推廣、茶業改良場設有示範茶園及特約茶園、以資茶農的觀摩懦染、並派員赴茶場附近各茶莊、指導製茶、及箱裝改良方法、以期改良工作推廣、</p>

<p>選擇蔗種　閩省原有的竹蔗、莖細如竹、其耐旱力雖强、而蔗莖的收量過少、所含糖分不多閩省政府認為欲發展糖業必先改良蔗種、特於二十四年春，貸款與仙遊縣栽植台灣蔗種的蔗農、同時、派員前往閩南各縣調查甘蔗品種．及栽培狀况、認為近年民間輸入的爪哇大莖蔗種、品質優良、適於閩省的栽培、惟數量太少、難於普及、乃委託漳浦幫祥農場、專培爪哇蔗種五百萬株、於二十五年春以無價或廉價推廣於閩南各縣、當時以運輸不便、僅在龍溪等九縣，試植一百三十餘萬株、凡農民栽培爪哇種蔗苗、每畝由政府貸以蔗種及肥料费十元、雖一時未能遍及、但農民對爪哇蔗種頗為歡迎、經一再繁殖後、現閩南一帶的爪哇優良的蔗種已較以前大增了、關於甘蔗的試種事業、閩省政府已創設漳浦農場、新闢場地四百餘畝、從事甘蔗的試種　良、經試騐結果、認為爪哇蔗種遠比本地蔗種為優、甘蔗栽植時期應改春植為秋植、此外並舉行甘蔗肥料試騐、从耐旱栽培試騐等、結果均甚完滿、</p>
<p>貸款接濟　閩省政府對於蔗糖事業、除改良甘蔗外、一方面計劃籌設大規模工廠、另一方面盡力扶助民間蔗糖企業的發展、如漳浦豐祥農場、特於二十六年起、由建設廳派員整理、投資三萬元、改為官商合辦以為閩南農村小規模機械製糖的示範、此外龍溪的宅內農場，永春的大鶴農場、南安的溫陵蔗糖公司、同安的角坂農場等、皆會由省府撥款扶助战貸資接濟、　其發展、</p>

<h3>怎樣的戀愛纔算　懂得戀愛的真諦？</h3>
<p>在社會上，常因婚姻得不到美滿的配合，惹出無窮的痛苦，這實在由於不正確的錯誤的婚姻親念所造成，所以你要認清婚姻的根本觀念，是男女問「自己」互得一個終生的關係最密切的侣伴，而不是「父母們」的「擇婿」　　「娶媳」；所以婚姻是決不能由父母作主的。所以青年應當由自己去選擇好的配耦，好的丈夫。</p>
<p>雖然，是應由青年自己去選擇配耦，邢應究竟該怎樣才能得到好的配耦呢？這須要經過一個歷程，這歷程便是「戀愛」！本間久雄說：「婚姻以戀爱為基礎；假使沒有戀愛，就是具備了什麼條件，那婚姻就成為因襲的買賣的勾當。」爱倫凱也說：「嫵諭怎樣的婚姻，有戀愛，便是道德的，即使怎樣經過了法律的手續，沒有戀愛，是不道德的了。」所以我們知道戀愛是婚姻的第一條件事婚姻的核心和要素；要雙方經過了真的戀愛而結合的婚姻，才是合理的。</p>
<p>在這裹，你先要認識戀愛的真諦！戀爱是以健康為根源而發生的異性間的特殊愛情，然而你不能以為是單純的生殖衝動；生殖達於健康化的境界，才能成立戀爱！</p>
<p>有許多青年，他們不備戀愛的真諦，每漠視生殖機能的健康，所以婚後會感情不睦。</p>
<p>講到生植機能失健的原因，以婚前自瀆荒淫，及婚後縱慾過度為最多，因此體力和精神能力的發達都受阻碍，便促成遺精，早洩，陰瘘，神經衰弱，婚後不妊，未老先衰的一大原因，生殖力既頹然無力，則夫婦之爱祇及於表面，簡言之，即缺少性愛是也。</p>
<p>今之罹患上述各症的人，何不從早求醫，以免愛情長此受損，據余多年來治療的經騐所知，德國睾丸精質製劑男用「補體康」最為對症，自問世以來，世界名醫，咸一致推崇，余常試用以腦弱，腎虧早洩病人，無不應手而愈，其女用「補體康」尤為調經種子聖藥！</p>
<h3>自凟引起遺精滑精的原因</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學士鄭霆</p>
<p>為什麼自凟會致遺精滑精呢？其理甚為明顯，蓋自凟能使勃起神經，射精中樞過敏，故在熟睡時及不知不覺間會無意識地流精，其次數逐漸增密，使精血枯竭，所以新陳代謝的機會逐漸遲鈍。結果腦神經，性神經，及脊髓部分大受損傷，致一切虛弱症象，隨之　起！</p>
<p>由於自瀆成習之故，雖已爆發了遺精，如能及早知害戒絕，則可免一切弊害，而現在流行之療法殊多，如睡前用冷水摩撿局部，電氣療法，攝護腺按摩，及藥劑內服等等，余以臨診十餘年的經驗，深悉未有審慎攝生，睡前服以「耐而斯遺精片」，較有功效，其他之辦法，祇可作為輔助而已，蓋冷水按摩電療等，其效故不出於按摩範圍之外，而「耐而斯遺精片」藥力深達精關，尚具鎮靜大腦神經之功，如已受遺精過頻而未有神經衰弱等症者，兼服「補體康」頗有卓效</p>

<h3>什麼是：淋病的死對頭？</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士　黃仲昌</p>
<p>什麼是淋病的死對頭？這句話表面上覺得是兀突。而實際上淋病這一種毛病，確也使人頭痛，而不知現在這種跳梁無忌的淋病，確已到了末日了。因為淋病是花柳病中最難治的病患，牠有强頑的抵抗力，及有狡猾的逃避法，凡是一經染上淋病，如不作徹底的根治。牠將永遠不能根治。因之遂有淋病無藥醫的口號。</p>
<p>可是科學進步，醫學亦一日千里，此向視為不可根治的淋病，現已有淋病特效槳「克淋儂」一藥之發明，此劑係用特種蛋白體黄色素混合，以科學方法製成之，所以絕無粗雜不純粹之成分，而無不良之副作用，因之用於一般淋毒症狀，呈特有功效。請讀者觀於下述一點，即可明白：</p>
<p>第一：「克淋儂」的殺菌功效，異常迅速，凡服此劑後短期中，即發生抗淋噬菌作用，此種作用，能直接達於病灶，將所有的淋菌，包圍而殲滅之，凡淋菌所在之地，「克淋儂」殺菌的效力，即追蹤而至。故一服「克淋儂」，淋病無不立愈也。凡不論急慢性淋中之攝護腺炎，睾丸炎，前後尿道炎，關節炎等，及婦女淋毒性自带，陰道炎，子宫炎，卵巢炎等，皆可服「克淋儂」根治之。惟男子可外用「抗淋水」女子可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥，皆可在家按圖與說明書自行使用自療，尤為簡便實用。有此言之，「克淋儂」既是征服各期淋病的死對頭。所以能風行全地球，專家一致稱贊使用。非有實效，那能有此成績！</p>
<h3>咳嗽的將來</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>咳嗽一症，似乎人人都有這個經騐，但有許多原因的咳嗽，却並不容易治好。嗽聲不絕，或乾咳無痰，或咯痰不爽，或痰多如絮，或痰中混血，總之咳嗽不治，將來甚為危險，中國人十九有肺病潛伏，平時因抵抗力强大，所以四面包圍結核菌，但抵抗力往往為咳嗽而消失，此結核菌即突圍而出，如虎出柙。肆行無忌，故咳嗽之後，繼之以癆病，尤為恒見之事。為防咳嗽趨於惡化超見，不得不迅速根治咳嗽，「補肺拿爾」一藥，昨為鎮咳除痰的唯一特效藥，不論一二三期肺病，無不應手而愈，久為中外肺病專家所稱許。</p>

<h3>淋毒膀胱炎能致人死</h3>
<p>因淋毒而致命者，於吾人臨床數見不鮮。而業為一般人所忽視之淋毒性膀胱炎，亦每有惹起垂危之險境。原來淋毒性膀胱炎，為淋菌侵入膀胱而起，因膀胱是儲尿之府。故其症狀，尿意頗為頻數，小便每日在三四十次之多，往往於敷分鐘，又起欲小便者。若在夜間，尤為頻數，以致不能安枕而失眠。及神經衰弱者，他如排尿之後，自少腹以至尿道，皆發生疼痛，排出尿液，其尿細甚細，遠不及健康時之粗大，劇時因此種痛楚過甚。故排尿時益感困難，又據吾人平日實地之經驗，因尿液中間，混有膿液，故呈溷濁之乳白色，有時且排出血尿。而尤為可怖者，如一旦成為慢性，及排尿不暢，膀胱内所積之宿尿日多，致脹滿不堪，如不急救，由尿中毒而致命。</p>
<p>本症之治療，切勿作迂緩而無當之療法，因為此種療法，對於此種急如星火之膀胱炎，決無濟於事。故必須急使敏捷手術，排去宿尿，始可解块。否則難免變症蜂起，治療更為躊躇矣。余年來對於淋毒性膀胱炎之將成尿中毒症象者，即用手術排除之。其對於一般的淋毒性膀胱炎，下腹部施行溫罨療法，及德國靜電療法，一方内服淋病聖藥「克淋膿」，俾其在病灶上，直接起噬菌抗淋消炎利尿作用，則附着於膀胱與其他部分之附菌，皆一鼓剷除肅消，決難漏網，惟是許多患者溺於延宕之总習，不肯將此如洪水猛獸之淋病，速行有效之補救。而致尿中毒致死者，豈不可嘆！診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日起每天送診二十號每號僅取號金五角。</p>

<h3>英遠東艦隊司令　諾貝爾過暹交驩　對中國抗戰前途表示樂觀</h3>
<p>盤谷通訊、暹政府近頒行新令、對華人進口、每名須繳納居留稅金二百銖、（約值國幣六百元）又增加華貨進口稅、比去年增五份之一、並常有壓迫華橋愛國運動之行為，英遠東艦隊司令諾貝爾中將、今春訪問菲律濱，海防等處、三月一日訪澳門總、四日在香港與廣州日軍參謀田中、商洽羅湖被炸案、六日飛肯特旗艦、花摩夫座艦往</p>

<p>酬酢極歡　意義重大、異乎尋常、直至十四下午、英司令始乘艦離暹往星、參加十六日的星洲防守大操演、試騐遠東防務是否　固、記者會登花摩夫艦拜訪之、適暹國防部長在旁、兩人正欲登岸遊覽、不能暢談、據英司令言、彼往遊覽各地的觀感、覺得遠東和平有更好的開展、進入佳境、彼對</p>
<p>中日戰事　、不願有所表示祇言中國抗戰前途已入於良好有利之階段、彼說話時態度嚴謹，語氣肯定有力、吾人可以预測英司令此行、必有良好的收穫、又美國甲級一萬噸以上的巡艦『阿膠士打』『馬爾濱海特』兩艘、繼英司令之後、拜訪暹羅、該艦係由菲律濱方面開往者、順道星洲觀操，最近一月之內、法英美海軍皆往訪暹羅、南洋前途之安危、與暹羅今後的動向、確值得世人之重視、</p>
<h3>鼓浪嶼　恐怖加深</h3>
<p>鼓浪嶼通訊、厦門淪陷後、相距咫尺的鼓浪嶼、在日軍威脅之下、已經成了陰森恐怖的世界了、最近日領在鼓，大施淫威、派遣大批　戰隊、荷槍實彈、如臨大敵一般的到處衝來闖去、搜捕青年、給果把鼓嶼湖人董事會委員李家骥从國際就機會糧食股長英着盔牧師、先後抓去諸如此類的殘暴行為、不勝枚擧、幸而鼓嶼的外僑很多、目睹日軍這般瘋狂、為了維持鼓浪嶼的治安、以保全他們的利益，才由法領出頭交涉、日方自己也覺得天天這樣派隊衝闖、　屬無謂．便趁勢暂時暖和下来、改派偵探、結隊成　、在街頭巷尾，明偵暗緝、共抓去二十多人、聽說一月十三那天、已有十三各爱國同胞，慘被殺害、同時又派遣　探、巡察難民收容所、凡是稍為使他注目的青年、就被　詰扣留、在晚間、每借名逮捕不穩分子、攀牆潛入、做盡姦淫搶刦的强盗勾當、可憐這一　無辜的難民、遭受蹂躪、只好吞聲飲泣、鼓浪嶼本是有「世外桃源』的美號的、而今變成丁陰森恐怖的世界、</p>
<h3>飛機濫施轟炸　日艦圖擾閩海不逞　各艦均已轉駛厦门</h3>
<p>福州通訊閩省沿海自本年一月初旬、日艦在晉江縣之秀塗、與惠安縣之下垵騷擾後、迄今兩月、鮮見飛機軍艦踪跡、地方甚為平靖、乃日方最近又有侵犯閩省沿海之企圖、本月六日、閩南海澄、同安．晋江．惠安四縣沿海地方、忽由厦門開到日艦九艘、分泊於海滄、集美．秀塗．下按等處海面、放下汽艇、截刦過往民船（計刦去三艘損失四萬餘元）並檢查外國商船、七日先由停泊同安日艦由清晨三時起、至九時止、向集美開砲三次、計十八響、毀民房一間、斃耕牛一尾、停泊海澄日艦、向海滄開砲一次、計九響、均落海灘或荒地、未有損失、八日下午又由停泊惠安日艦、起飛飛機四架、向悔澄．龍溪．南靖．同安.晉江．惠安各縣偵察、並在同安縣屬之集美、晋江縣屬之　埔，惠安縣屬之秀塗三處投彈、計在集美投彈三次、共十九枚、集美碼頭及集美小學均詖燬、　埔投彈六枚、並開機槍數十響、燬民船一八艘、房屋一間、斃平民十二人、受傷十二入、秀塗投彈五枚、炸沉民船三艘、至九日該日艦以肆擾目的已達、全部九艘、均</p>
<p>開回厦門</p>
<p>及小型航空母艦一艘、分泊於福州閩江口，連江縣屬之南竿塘、馬祖澳東沙島、及長樂縣屬之梅花港四處海面、即放下汽艇游飞、先後刦去漁船四艘、貨舱二艘、船身均被放火焚燒、船員則被掳去、生死不明、十日上午十一時、至下午四時、由航空母艦起飛飛　四次、在閩江口岸一帶偵探、福州當發出空製警報四次、該機並在長門投彈二次、共六枚、均落山地、未有損失、十一日上午、又由航空母艦起飛八架分往連江、長祟、沿海偵探、並在連江縣屬之琯頭、投下四彈、炸沉駁船一艘、死一人傷三人、又莆州縣屬之平海、亦於十日由厦門開到日艦二艘、上午各載飛機一架、於十一日下午、飛往福州，莆田、仙遊、惠安各縣沿海地方偵察、該兩艦即開往惠安縣屬之崇武、傍晚向岸上開砲十万響、均落海灘、至十二日晨停泊閩江口外之三軍艦、及航空母艦、均開出白犬洋面、在憂門已遙望不見、停泊崇武之兩軍艦，則向厦門開去、騷擾數日之海疆、至此</p>
<p>始告平靖</p>
<p>但據一般觀察、日方在華作戰兵力巳日趨削弱、以甯滬蘇杭之平原地帶、無一險可守、遊擊隊描來去自如、使日軍疲於奔命、無法應付、閩省東南雖屬沿海、但稍進數十里或百餘里、即　　起伏、林深菁密、為天然之遊擊區、且民性好勇善鬥、存槍極多、更為絕好遊擊隊、日方欲圖佔據、絕非易事也</p>

<h3>常州近郊激戰　華軍迭獲勝利</h3>
<p>武進通訊、常州至蠡河橋、前日有華軍游擊隊百餘名、衝至該處包圍偽警所，當場擊斃偽警兩名、活擒六名、槍械全數繳去、詎為常州城中日軍所悉、派隊出城、抵達蠡河橋、游擊隊即化整為零、將日軍分頭擊破、日軍陣亡十三名、傷者更多、步槍遺棄十四枝、小鋼砲二尊、又南鄉二十公里戴溪橋鎮．東壇墅．以及西山島後面、望亭鎮．青暘鎮．九軒璜塘鎮．連日華軍葉部與日軍發生激戰、先後均為華軍克復、最近日軍强迫華人趕築之丹常公路、亦被華軍別動隊破壞、二十五日坂上鎮到有新四軍數百人、將盤踞鎮上之日警備隊、悉予擊潰、坂上鎮即經克復常州城中日軍非常恐慌、日以大砲向城外盲射、墟外為房、披燬尢多、</p>

<h3>莊澤宣談　高等教育改革問題（下）</h3>
<p>養成整理內地建設人才</p>
<p>養成移民殖邊專門人才</p>
<p>以前注意整理内地工作的高教機關、不幸均在戰區内、以致大都被迫停止工作、僅剩江蘇省立教育學院、已遷至廣西、而五大學合辦的鄉政實習所、則遷至貴州定番、改稱鄉政學院，鄙人認為此種機關、最好每省籌設一所，或就已有的高教機關改辦、當然整理內地的工作、必須由此種機關與當地政府密切合作、此種機關所需之教授、應以社會科學各方面的專家為主體、在第一年予學生以基本訓練後、應以內地急　的問題為中心、而不以　　的學系來分組訓練、訓練的對象、多側重於處事待人接物方面、一從做裏學從做裏教　　共同解決、問題的探討、各地的經驗．應設法互相交換以資參考、</p>
<p>以前注意邊疆開發的高教機關、本　太少而在抗戰以來、此種機關需要更迫，我認為至少須在西北西南及沿海擇三四中心、集中人力與时力、設立三四所高教機關、協助邊疆舆海外事業的發展、在西北與西南方面、應以自然科學的應用為課程主體、在第一年予學生以基本訓練後、就　殖.水利．交通．重工業．輕工業．冶鑛．醫藥衛生等部門、分組訓練、社會科學方面、應注重漢族以外各民族文化的探討、沿海方面的、應以社會科學的應用為課程主體、在第一年予學生以基本訓練後、就教育.金融.工商企業．工廠經營．運輸等部門在海外之發展為訓練對象、而以海外各地文化之研究為共同必修科、移民工作、本非易事，應先作小規模的試殖、逐漸擴大、所遇問題、由師生與移民共同研究解决途徑、</p>
<p>從戰區移出、或原在非戰區、比較未受大損失的高教機關、仍宜繼續原有工作、養成各學術與專門人才、如何分工合作、以冀附款省而收效大、也值得通盤籌劃、如此整個重新支配、或原有的教授太多，應由政府資助赴海外講學或服務、據鄙人所知、海外僑胞、極願担任一部分旅費，歡迎熟習祖國情况的學者前往作有系統的學術演講、同時或可帮助研究海外事業的發展方法、中央不妨仿照中小學教師服務團、組織大學教授服務團、至海外服務、凡此種種、如能辦到、不獨有助於目前之抗戰工作、且有利於將来的民族復興、（完）</p>

<h3>「華北」禁用法幣之今後</h3>
<p>（本刊第一次座談會紀錄）</p>
<p>日期　本年三月十八日中午十二時起</p>
<p>地點　報五樓會議廳</p>
<p>問題的出發</p>
<p>張一凡：</p>
<p>今天承蒙各位先生，從百忙中抽出時間來，參加敝刊的座談會；敝刊萬分覺到榮幸。各位先生，對於貨幣金融問題，非特在學理方面，都有精深的研究：而且對於實際方面，以及對於我國和日本的經濟實情方面，也都有精深的研究。敝刊現在想請敎各位的：就是國內外當前一致注意的法幣問題。即就是日本日夜所想破壞，而且已經長期破壞，直到現在，還是硬硼硼不動搖的法幣問題。法幣的基礎，本來就很鞏固；這决中英又成立滙兌平準基金的借款，那更硬到像水泥鋼筋的牆壁一般，雖則如此，但我們還是應該討論討論日本方面，對於法幣的態度究兌怎樣？並且想研究研究他們的破壞工作，何以運續失敗？不妨冉推想推想他以後還會做些什麼戲來？請各位先生不吝指敎！</p>
<p>唐慶增：</p>
<p>關於本問題，可以有二種不同的看法。從整僩的局面看，日本在華北禁用法幣，恐怕沒有多大効果。因爲：（一）聯銀券不能在我方游擊隊控制的地區內通行：（二）金融重心有從都市移向內地的趨努，因此日木所指定的行使聯銀券幾個地區不能發生顯著的作用；（三）民衆的愛國心使他們對偽券存着一種歧視。有了以上三點，可以想見日本要在目前立刻摧毀法幣的根基，恐怕有些不可能。所以我們所常注意的，也許倒是局部的問題。例如投機問題或黑市問題等，而解决的關鍵，也不能忽視外商銀行所具的作用。治本辦法須使進出口外滙等完全集中政府指定之銀行，則黑市勢力，自然日就减削。</p>
<p>張一凡：</p>
<p>發生黑市塲的原因，中要的恐怕在心理方面，因爲法幣本身是一種管理幣制，除了金準傭等經濟條件之外，便是國家的政治條件，就是金本位幣制，在戰時尚且要動搖，何况對方又在力謀破壞法幣，假使大家對於法幣本身，和日本對於法幣的企圖，能多明白一些，那末心理條件，自然而然地更圓滿起來了。</p>
<p>日方的計謀姚慶三：</p>
<p>日本這次在華北推廣聯銀券，禁用法幣，主要的目的，雖在於經濟；但也未始不含有政治的目的。因爲貨幣的變更，可以影響人民對於政府的態度。換言之：某地流通法幣，那末該地的人民，就希望法幣不要跌價；因此他們又希望支持法幣的國民政府，能够得到勝利。如果聯銀券取得了流通的地位，那末人民手裹有的只是聯銀券了；道也許會變更他們對於政府的心理；他們或者會希望華北臨時政府的永久存在了。這就是日本政府之所以要拼命破壞法幣，拼命推行偽券的理由。此外，日本在華北想推行偽聯鈔，目的想使華北的金融加入——日團集團，就可以在貿易方面佔得很多便宜。就是發軍餉等，也都可以應用聯銀券了。用了聯銀券，當然是日本欠了聯合準備銀行的錢，說得漂亮些，也可算是聯合準備銀行把錢存在日本人那裏。於是日本在華北的一切開支，就可以不化自己的錢了。但事實上，日本的這種希望，幾乎全部失敗了，現在聯券的使用情形，大概可分三種：在游擊區域內，它是絕對不通用的；在租界內，它尚不能和法幣相競爭，法幣的價值，一般地還在聯銀券之上；至於在日本所指定的那幾個所謂聯鈔通行區內，也許可以勉强說是它的勢力範圍·因爲在指定的區域內，使用法幣是犯法的；而且規定將來的銀錢契約，須註明聯銀券的數目；如果載明法幣，債務人就得以六折還債，在這種種壓迫之下的人，固然都不能不使用聯銀券了；但這是被迫使用，並非是自然的流通。所以根本沒有貨幣信用可言，人心依然在　幣的一邊、</p>
<p>朱　　：</p>
<p>中國人擁護國民政府，決不祇是法幣，日方對於這個關係，故意煊染得萬分密切，這是故意抹然中國抗戰上的民族意識，日本破壞法幣，具有政治上的陰謀，我們當然不能吾認，但我們決不可相信這是他們唯一的理由的。</p>
<p>劉鐵孫：</p>
<p>日本在輩北禁用法幣，經濟。政治兩個目的是兼有的。在經濟方面，因爲禁用法幣，日本可以封鎖華北資源：華北出口土產，換得外滙，供給日本向歐美購買原料：另一面免得華北土產運入中央勢力範團內，增加法幣的外匯頭寸。政治方面：華北禁用法幣之後，華北同中央在經濟上的關係，無形隔斷了，對於人民心理上日本希望牠能發生若干作用。所以我以爲對付此項問題的方法，應採用政洽方面的對策，比較來得切實。</p>
<p>張一凡：</p>
<p>日本在淪陷區域內，絕對禁用法幣，在經濟上將使佔領區和未佔領區形成二種完全不同的現象，偽券的流通地域狹小，日本想集中淪陷區的出口外滙自然也减少，這豈不是他攫奪出口外滙的一種自殺政策</p>
<p>吳承禧：</p>
<p>把淪陷區和非淪陷區斷絕起來，這也許不是日本人的主意；不過他們現在旣無法將聯銀券打進游擊區域，就只好先造成這種隔離的現象。李權時：</p>
<p>所以日本方面也分成二派主張，有的主張不要摧毀法幣的價值，有的中張絕對破壞。因此現在的分成聯鈔區和法幣區，也許以是爲了保持面子罷孫禮榆：</p>
<p>日本最初唆使臨時政府設立「聯合準備銀行」的時候，大概含有二個目的·其一是在華北創設一種新的幣制，與日圓等價連繫，使華北加入日圓集團，成爲他們的經濟領土；其二是想把「聯銀券」充作軍費，就是徵發物資，减輕其他國內的戰費負担。但是實際上這二個目的是彼此衝突的，因爲要使華北加入日本的經濟集團，先得維持「聯銀券」的價值；要張羅軍費，搜刮華北物資，又非濫發「聯銀券」不可。所以即使日本如何設法抬高「聯銀券」的價值，終於無法挽回牠的信用。現在「聯銀券」的發行額已經超過二萬萬圓，並不是聯銀券的流通力增加，那不過是濫發其國銀行鈔票來掠奪物資的結果，目前華北物價的飛漲，正是說明了當地通貨膨脹的嚴重；總之經濟的事情完全是實力問題，日本經濟脆弱，無力援助華北樹立新幣制；華北本身又無法獲得大量外滙，失敗當然是意中事。此後，隨着日本經濟的枯竭，對於華北的搜刮也更加緊，「聯銀券」的信用必更失隋，他們的計盡終成爲夢想，這是亳無疑義的。所可恨的是他們借了中國人的名義，掠奪華北中國人的物資，使華北的人民遭受極大的荼毒，將來在整理上，是個大問題。</p>
<p>史亦聞：</p>
<p>目前華北日當局禁用法幣，我以爲也是不必擔憂的，他們無論如何是禁用不了。這次禁用法幣！在去年三月十日偽聯銀成立時已經決定了的，現在他們要這樣的來一下，無疑的是爲貫澈其所謂政令，保持他的體面。同時確也眞的希望能由此來推廣偽聯鈔的流通，但是，一種貨幣的流通，必要有其經濟的基礎，單靠政洽力量，是不能勉强的。華北的日偽當局，原想抄襲在偽滿的老文章；先成立一個中央銀行，由該行發鈔來收回舊幣。但是當時偽滿的情形，與目前華北的情形不同。偽滿中央銀行能在二年內將境內雜鈔完全收回，是因（一）偽滿鈔以日圓爲後盾，而當時的日圓，並未跌價，且可自由購買外匯；（二）偽滿的對外貿易是出超；（三）當時在偽滿流通的雜鈔，質用不甚佳。所以各種雜鈔，容易被打倒。但華北的情形，與此相反；不但（一）偽聯鈔的後盾——日圆——自身的信用是很動搖，又不可自由購買外滙；而且（二）日偽所宜傳的日本銀行團貸款一萬萬給偽聯銀，也完全是騙人的話；（三）華北對外貿易是入超；（四）法幣價值穩定，可以購買外匯，中外商人都樂用。這樣，偽聯鈔的流通力自然很弱，不能與法幣相競爭，所以日偽當局，要效法偽滿，是辦不到。</p>
<p>不過，有一件值得注意的事：華北的日偽當局，盡力想把存在天津租界內的五千萬元白銀，攫爲己有，去年日偽當局，曾再三向英法租界要求把白銀交出，但是被英法租界當局拒絕了。其後日偽所以幾决三番要封鎖英法租界，一部份的原因，也就在此。但是日偽當局，並不因此斷念，其後目一度指使天津市商會會長王竹林，要他出面運動銀錢業公會及商會等團體，用所謂「民間」的力量，要求英法租界把白銀交出，但是王氏在去年十二月被刺殞命了，因此這件事就延擱下來。不過華北日偽當局對此猶未心死？尚在暗中進行，所以我們應該隨時加以提防，並時時督請友邦，嚴守向來的態度。</p>
<p>天津租界方面</p>
<p>張一凡：</p>
<p>天津租界一裏的華商銀行，已經收用偽鈔，眞相究屬怎樣？和這件事有沒有關係？</p>
<p>吳承禧：</p>
<p>天津華商銀行的收受偽鈔，在去年就已見諸事實，不是最近才開始的。這有一段歷史因緣。原來過去天津各銀行所吸收的存就，數量很大，但由於華北的局勢的不安，南方資金出路較廣，大都運到上海來運用。七七事變後，國家銀行的鈔票又陸續向南方輸來了不少。戰後要想運送回去，也不可能，因此在市塲缺乏籌碼的時候，便只好收受偽鈔，以濟燃眉。去年十月的時候，偽政府曾向天津各銀行作過一番威脅，說是要取銷國民政府財政部所規定的每星期只准提取存款百分之五的限制。這大概也是促使各銀行和偽鈔發生關係的一個因素。現在華北各行存款均較以前增加，對於價務的應付，比以前已有辦法一點了。</p>
<p>姚慶三：</p>
<p>我記得向各銀行施行威脅的是天津「市長」潘毓桂，而不是臨時政府本身。但現在華北人民的智識水準是高得多了，因此他的威脅並沒有多大效果。後來天津銀行公會和潘毓桂商議的結果，仍舊維持限制提存的原來的規定，但將每星期的最多的提存額，酌量從一百五十元增加到三百元而已。</p>
<p>上海並無影響姚慶三：</p>
<p>自華北實行統制外滙後七海所受到的影響相當重大的。華北出口外滙的百分之六十，現在已被聯合準備銀行拿去了·只有其餘的百分之四十，可以自由出賣；因此華北進口貨所需要的外匯，與華北自由市塲上所能供給的外匯，差額一定很大。這不足的數額，勢必到上海來購求。換一句話說，法幣除了供給華中華南的外滙需要以外，連華北的外匯需要也要負祖一部份。近來天津滙到上海來的款項非常擁擠，這局勢是很嚴重的。聽說天津的中交三行，爲了補救這局勢，除了提高申滙的匯水外，並巳限制每人每日的滙款的額度了。目前申匯的價格大概是每千元六十元，這匯率也許還有增高的可能。</p>
<p>李權時：</p>
<p>這種現象也就是說明聯銀券的跌價。但講求實利的日本人，是不會介意的。進一步說，只要聯銀劵輾轉的換到外滙，它就根本不必推行到南方來了。</p>
<p>吳承禧：</p>
<p>關於偽鈔勾通申滙的問題，我冉補充一點意見。聯銀券不必到華中來，現在就和來了的一樣。這對上海有兩種不利，第一是使上海國家銀行的發行感受壓迫，並且上海的游資本來已很充斥，如今再增添許多滙入款自更加重運用游資的困難，與促進投機的活躍，第二，匯款南來以後，外匯市塲當然要受到很大的影響，就是聽任匯率自然高漲上去，漸漸减少申滙的數量，但到了那時，我們已吃了很大的虧了。因此我覺得最近天津中交二行的限制滙款的額度，與抬高匯水確是一個切要的舉動。</p>
<p>王宗培：</p>
<p>外匯統制的結果，加甚了上海市塲的投機，一年以來，上海的投機家，老是在外滙，外幣，烚赤，公價，洋商股票，棉紗等等各方面，週而復始地掀風作浪，一命兒抬高，一會兒壓低，倒霉的散戶，時常是到處碰壁，所以發「國難財一的，固然大有其人，外行吃虧的也是不少咧！</p>
<p>朱爾嘉：</p>
<p>從本人這次桂·湘·鄂·川·黔·滇等省旅行的見聞所及，覺得法幣外滙的價值，內地比較上海高出很大，而且農礦工商各種企業可供發展的，所在都是；所以關於上海各銀行充斥的游資，和資金運用上的困難問題，本人以爲只要各銀行能降低上海對內地的滙率，他方面再收縮市面上海劃頭頭襯，那末一方面可使資金內移，减少運用上的困難，他方面也可以遏制外滙黑市塲及其他投機市塲上的波動。</p>
<p>魏友裴：</p>
<p>當借款成立的前後，消息傳出了以後，許多從前購有外滙的人都把外滙賣出來，連日方銀行也是如此，雖經部份銀行吸收，但市價還是繼續放畏。所以外匯基余成立了以後，外滙暗市的放長，我以爲倒不是在外滙基金的本身發生作用，乃是因此種空氣的鼓動下，使外滙市塲中的人心更堅定起來所致。</p>
<p>孫禮榆：</p>
<p>常日本聲言將於三月十日以後在華北禁用法幣的時候，有一小部分人惟恐華北的法幣發生問題，都相率在暗市裹購進外匯，因此喑市受到相當的壓迫；但是正在這時候，英國政府在議會發表中英外滙基金成立的消息，大家都知道法幣基礎鞏固，反有大量外匯的拋出，暗市匯價就放長到八便士半。華北人民知道法幣絕對不會成問題，大量退藏起來了，外匯市塲就鬆了許多；，日本當局本來以爲禁止法幣流通，可以威脅人民，以法幣調換「聯銀券」，多套取些外滙，但是這詭計現在又失敗了。</p>
<p>不敢到「華中」</p>
<p>姚慶三：</p>
<p>不單如此，日本對於上海，所以暫時不想摧毀法幣，還有一個經濟上的原因。因爲他可以拿在華北所搜刮的法幣到上海來購買外滙，如果上海的法幣不值錢，他更蒙受損失了</p>
<p>史亦聞：</p>
<p>華北日偽當局，現在向他勢力支配下的地方，實行挨戶搜查，把抄獲的法幣，加以沒收。這種作風，非但於法幣的流通力無損，而且是加强人民對牠的信用。就日偽方面的立塲講，在經濟上固然毫無所獲，而在政治上的損失，則允不能以任何代價買回來。因爲一般人民從此留下更深刻的印象，知道失去自己國家保護後的人民，應該走那條路。</p>
<p>至於華中方面連日本人自己，也主張應該讓法幣繼續存在；至少他們是認爲一時無法破壞的。譬如上海的日僑商會會長吉田政治，他對於法幣的見解，認爲切不可急進。而且日前日本國內一般商人團體，如東京大阪等地的商會——都主張將華中與所謂「日圓集團」分離開來，仍以法幣，為華中貿易的通貨。如果硬把華中劃入「日圓集團」，則日本對於華中的輸出必須加以限制；華中一帶市塲，勢必盡爲第三國所奪。所以，日本國內的商人以及在上海的日僑，都主張利用法幣，不贊成把牠打倒。這種見解，目前在日本頗佔優勢；而且日本政府，已經照他們的意見在執行；例如近來緩和對華中輸出限制，許法幣結算貨價，以及華北日偽當局的貿易統制，以華中爲第三國；皆是明顯的例證。</p>
<p>魏友棐：</p>
<p>日方非特無法對付法幣，而且遝無法維持日圓，無論他國內統制資木如何嚴厲，但是逃避的資本，還是很鉅，據說虹口某大廈，這决被日商以五百幾十萬的代價收買去後，日本當局會出來十涉，呵責他們爲什麼不拿這許多寶貴的金錢放到國內去應用，却來購進這麼一注不動產。如果這個傳說可靠的話，便足以說明日本民衆資金逃避的一般了。</p>
<p>史亦聞：</p>
<p>最近，日本的著名中國通——土屋計左右——又提出一個所謂「貿易通貨」方案，用以破壞華中方面的法幣。去年夏季，土屋氏已提過一個澈底打倒法幣的「恢復銀本位」案，因無法實施而擱淺。但這次是主張暫時保留華中的法幣，僅建議由南京偽府組織一個銀行，由該銀行以十足的現金準備，發行可以自由購買外滙的紙幣，這種紙幣名之日「貿易通貨」，用以爲貿易的結算手段，（例如廢兩改元前的兩，及在廣東方面貿易上所用的港幣）俟其信用確立後，才逐漸推廣到全中國代替法幣的地位。這種方案，顯然是空中樓閣，當然無法實行的。但由於土屋氏方案的朝三暮四，也可以看出日本的陰謀徒然心勞日拙，同時也正是反證中國國力的堅强，法幣基礎的鞏固。</p>
<p>控制貿易之真相</p>
<p>姚慶三：</p>
<p>這次華北統制出口，並不及預料的嚴厲。這次只有十二類貨物受到統制。據民國二十六年的統計，進些貨物的出口數爲八千八百萬，轉口數爲六千六百萬，共計一萬五千四百萬，的佔華北出口轉口總數的百分之四十。但實際上，除了這十二種外，關於羊毛皮革棉花等，在去年就巳實行統制了。這幾種的出口數是七千一百萬，轉口數是一千三百萬，合共爲八千四百萬。述上述的十二種併計起來，共爲二萬四千萬光景。的佔華北各關出口轉口總數的百分之六十以上。他們的統制辦法是這樣：出口商如欲將被統制的十二類貨物運輸出口，必需先將可收的外滙，按一先令二便士的官價買給滙兌銀行，再由滙兌銀行轉賣給聯合準備銀行，滙兌銀行，並可向聯合準備銀行補進，其所出售的進口匯　，但其數額則以其售於後者的出口滙票爲限度，又關於出口的統制在項目上規定得很詳細，而進口統制却只作原則上的規定。不過將來在實行上，我想一定也不會使商人獲得怎樣自由的。</p>
<p>孫禮榆：</p>
<p>對於進口貨的統制，實際上也是非常嚴厲的；「中國聯合準備銀行」所發表的公告裹，雖然沒有規定商品的種類，但是進口商人在請求撥給外滙之際，却有提出報告的義務，「聯銀」當局考查商品的性質，然後撥給外滙，所以他們很有選擇商品的餘地。最近「聯銀」向各外滙銀行通告，規定農業器具及機械類等四十餘種商品，有優先輸入權，由此史可以證明所謂「聯銀」當局有統制進口貨的意思。他們在公告裹，雖然說明各外滙銀行可在其購得的外匯數額範圍以內，出售外滙，但是依照他們統制外匯的木意——就是要想增加「聯銀」的外滙頭寸的意思來說，「聯銀」是絕對不會把全體收得的外匯出售的。因此我們可以預想，進口的商品除了日本貨以外，一定有大量的减少。</p>
<p>姚慶三：</p>
<p>在津海關的公布上，對於進口貨的項目，並無任何的規定：即在聯合準備銀行的公布上，對於進口貨也只作抽欽的規定。但無論如何，即使文字上限制得不很嚴格，實際上將來仍會予人種種留雜的。</p>
<p>產業統制失敗之例</p>
<p>張一凡：</p>
<p>他想從統制貿易上攫取外匯，記過必然使當地的商業與生產愈高手壓迫：政治權利運用到經濟上去，要不發生阻碍：必需取得民意擁護的政治權力才可以。現在華北的情形完全相反，所以統制愈嚴密，成功的希望便愈渺小。</p>

<p>本人以爲「聯銀券」與法幣的對立，性質上經濟的作用和政治的作用，兩者並重：不過初時似乎偏重經濟；他們希望靠著「聯銀券」的流通，逐出法幣於其佔領區域勞力範圍之外，故推廣「聯銀券」流通的第一步手段，是從統制華北所產貨物着手的，如棉·煤·鐵·農產品等，皆在統制之列。擄說：初時日本對於華北的棉煤兩項統制，極爲嚴厲；但結果均歸失敗，就煤礦說：截至現在，在其佔領區內，除沿鐵路綫的煤礦，尚能產煤以外，其他各地，即非其權力所及。像山西各地，因經過堅壁淸野的游擊戰後，當地人工缺乏，所以生產都停頓起來。至於棉花產地大都在游擊隊控制範圍以內。，據聞各該地棉產以供應當地需要數量爲限，此外不得種植逾額棉　：並禁止私運。由於上述原因，日方所以有解除華北棉花統制的命令，恢復自由買賣；日方鑒於經濟性的方法，旣告失敗；所以今後必將出以偏重政治性的手段，殆可預言。</p>
<p>王宗培：</p>
<p>關於華北的棉花統制，最初不過在通商口岸限制出口，內地各處，中國商人還可自由版運。那個時候，華北游擊區的棉產，雖經游擊隊封鎖很嚴密，商販的走私偷運，也還是有的。後來日本人在鐵路綫一帶，加强統制，禁止中國人販運棉花，查到了便都給沒收，這末一來，走私的商販，也都不幹了，棉花的來源，也就絕跡，日本人根本就無花可收，沒有法子，才停止了內地統制的辦法。</p>

<p>張一凡：</p>
<p>日本計劃中的「法幣對策」愈多，愈足以反證他對於破壞法幣的無辦法。今天經各位先生多方面把日本對於法幣的態度，對於破壞法幣的計謀，以及法幣所處的環境，與其本身的基礎，以至於華北方面的變動，給與江南及上海谷地的影響等等，都給予深刻而且簡明的解剖和展望。敝刊十分感謝。允其因此座談而化去了各位業務時間，耽誤了各位的工作，更覺抱歉之至。謹代表敝報謝謝。</p>

<p>— 虞冷卿題</p>
<p>談話</p>
<h3>反吐痰運動</h3>
<p>— 琴</p>
<p>癆病的病菌，是肉眼看不見的小東西，但是癆病的兇猛，比老虎還厲害。以我國　說，每年每十萬居民中，死於癆病的，有三百餘人！如拿四萬萬五千萬人來計算，每年死於癆病的，約有一百六十萬人，這是多麼可怕的數字！</p>
<p>癆病的病菌，叫做結核菌，常和痰混在一起，所以患癆病的人，如果有隨地吐痰，便可隨地傅染癆病。</p>
<p>我們要預防癆病的傅染，先要實行勿隨地吐痰，隨地吐痰，不但容易傳染疾病，而且不清潔，不雅觀，這是一種很不好的習慣，一定要革除的！</p>
<p>現在上海婦女團聯合會，得到兩租界及華人教育處的贊助合作，特發起反吐痰運動．並定自三月廿六日起至四月一日止，舉行反吐痰運動宣傳週，到各學校及公眾場所演講宣傳吐痰的害處，和處置吐痰的適當方法。喜歡隨地吐痰的人，從此可以不再亂吐了。</p>
<p>該會編印一種反吐痰教材，是供給小學生閱讀用的。希望全市小學生，人各一冊，從小就養成不吐痰的習慣，大眾便不會再有隨地吐痰的惡習了。</p>
<p>該會並特製「健康為寶」徽章一種，以供參加運動的人佩带。這種徽章，含有兩個意義，第一，凡佩帶徽章的人，要立誓以後不隨地吐痰；如果要吐痰，必須吐在痰盂裏或手帕裹。第二，凡佩帶徽章的人，要隨時勸告人家，勿隨地吐痰。</p>
<h3>反吐痰運動與防癆方法</h3>
<p>— 賴斗岩</p>
<p>外人常譏笑我國為「東亞病夫」，其原因是我們的體格，遠不如他們，尤其是我國患癆病的人，此任何國的人都多。據最近的統計，每年每十萬居民中，死於癆病者，我國有三百餘人之多，日本祇有一百八十六人，法國一百六十四人，意國一百五十四人，德國九十八人，英國九十七人，美國最少，僅有八十人。</p>
<p>以全國人口四萬五千萬計算起來，我國人民每年死於癆病者，約有一百六十萬人，患者比此尤多三十倍（即四千八百萬人。）這種數目，實是驚人，假使死一個人，社會上的所受損失，約國幣二千元，則我國每年因癆病死亡的損失，至少有國幣三十二萬萬！倘把這筆巨款，來建小學（每一小學約計國幣一萬元），則每年可建三十二萬所，造福小朋友，真不少了。</p>
<p>癆病的經濟損失，既如上講，牠的病原是一種細菌，叫做結核菌。此菌最喜和痰混在一塊。所以患癆病的人，倘無公德心，隨地吐痰，則桔核菌可藉這個機會傅染别人。有一位醫師，近在上海把馬路上和其他公共場所的痰，拿來檢查，發現四分之一，帶着結核菌。這些細菌等到痰乾以後，可以隨處飛揚，而入人體，使人害病。你想吐痰是何等危險呢</p>
<p>我們要免去癆病的危險，最有效的方法，就是推行「反吐痰運動」。這種運動，從消極方面看來，就是我們每人頂好不要吐痰，如果絕對不能自制，則要将痰吐在痰盂裏，或手帕中，以免遺害他人。若從積極方面言之，我們就要注意日常衛生，如多運動，多吸新鮮空氣，多洗澡等等，這樣可便身體强健，痰自减少。</p>
<p>最後我們要想到對於別人的責任，我們不要僅僅獨善己身，也要勸勉他人如家族，鄰居，同學等，使他們亦知吐痰之害並明白保健之方。苟各位小朋友都如此做去，國家何患不強呢？</p>
<p>生活常識</p>
<h3>請勿吐痰！</h3>
<p>— 疾風</p>
<p>吐痰，這件事，在我們中國人看來，是一件很小的事情，正用不着來一個「反吐痰運動」，有痰就吐，吐了就算了，也用不着問吐在什麼地方．好在你咳嗽一聲，我喉嚨內也發癢，順便勿咯一聲，痰就出來，你吐一口，我吐一口，我們大家皆吐幾口，事情也算自由平等，並不含有不公的作用。所以你吐在電車上也好，吐在馬路上也好，甚而至於你不高興吐，一口嚥下去也好，完全自由，這有什麼要不起的事</p>
<p>偏是向一般講衛生的先生們，講吐痰的害處，講得頭頭是道，真使我又要信又不信；現在我把反吐痰運動的文件，節錄在下面，讓大家研究研究</p>
<p>痰，是人肺裏低級的黏液，從喉頭，氣管裏面黏膜分泌出來的，當我們傷凰咳嗽的時候，痰就跟着從嘴巴裹吐了出來。牠是身體內排洩出東西，據懂得醫學的人說，身體衰弱的人，抵抗力不足，常因寒暖失調，而成傷風感冒，以致喉頭和氣管部分發炎，分泌物特別增多，所以傷風咳嗽的人痰便特別增多．而患有肺病的人，肺内也有許多黏液分泌出来，也成功換，所以患肺病的人，常常要吐痰，此外吸烟的人，或住在不清潔不通氣的房屋的人，痰也特別多．總之無論什麼痰。在未吐時，牠能吸收空氣中的灰塵雜質，使之黏在鼻孔的懺毛舆黏液上（痰）與人的健康，很有好處．但痰一吐出之後，則成為排洩物，其中不僅含有灰塵雜質，且因各人身體的病弱，多含有結核菌或桿菌在内。此種病菌得黏液之助，易於依附。若黏液為日光曬乾之後。更可以隨風飄揚，再度侵入人們的氣管。因而傳染疾病，非常危險。許多人以為吐痰，有耗精神，所以不主張吐痰，而把痰吃下肚子裹去，唉呀！现在我們既然知道痰的內容物，只是些　埃和黏液，有的更雜有病菌，實是一種非常不潔和有害的東西，那麼痰怎麼可以吃下肚，但是痰既不能吃下肚，就應該吐，我國人多不講衛生隨地叶痰，已成習慣，室內沒有痰盂，就吐在地上，就是有了痰盂，有時也懶得走幾步，隨便就吐，至於外面道路上，更是大眾的痰盂了，以致濃艇薄痰，到虑都是，使人看到討厭．須知隨地吐痰，不但不清潔，不雅觀，並且極不衛生，據顯微镜檢查的結果，一口痰內所含的病菌，有時竟有幾千萬個之多，真是可怕，所以吐痰雖是小事．但關係却非常重大。為了處置吐痰起見，最好使人們不吐痰，若有痰，至非吐不可時，便須有吐痰的處　，大概在室內，如果有痰盂的话，應該吐在痰盂內，（能在痰盂內放些石炭酸等消毒藥品，以殺死痰內病菌則更佳）如果沒有痰盂的話，便須吐在紙內或手巾内，以便燒去或洗滌，若是在路上行走時，當然不合有痰盂，那只有吐在紙內手巾內，或陰溝內，切不可吐在馬路上。</p>
<p>不過，有一點，還須注意，就是現在有許多受過教育的人，已知道隨地吐痰的不合衛生，所以身邊都帶一塊手巾，逢到要吐痰時，便取出手巾來，吐在裏面，吐過仍放在衣袋裏，過了一會，再吐痰時，便又拿出來，吐在裏面，整天或一兩天不去洗滌，以致先時吐的痰，經過身體的溫度蒸發，早巳乾了，等下次取出再吐時，一去抖動，原來痰内的病菌，便會脫離手巾，飛揚空中，有傳染危險。所以吐痰人手巾，不快去洗，仍然足不衛生的．比較起來，這是吐痰入紙．隔一會放在火內燒去，才是合理．要不然，備二塊手巾，以便一次吐後，不再拿出，再要吐時，調用第二塊手巾。互相替換，然後洗净，亦無不可。</p>
<p>上面所說，還是處置有痰時非吐不可的辦法，至於防止不吐的辦法，必須從根本上着想，我們研究痰的成因，大致不外空氣與煤烟。以及身體上的貧弱，有以使然，據此，我們的住處能多闢窗戶，流通空氣，常常　掃，注意清潔，則痰亦可相對的减少。</p>
<p>此外我們還須多洗浴，少吃烟，除去身上的積垢，使皮膚排洩通暢，一方面鍛煉身體，則痰的成因，亦可相對的减少。願大家時時留意為要。</p>

<h3>文天祥</h3>
<p>— 張夢飛</p>
<p>（文天祥引）風雲带幻恨無窮。宋宝山河命巳終，一點丹心昭日月，平生浩氣貫長虹，</p>
<p>（文白）本閣文天祥，字宋瑞，乃是江西吉水人氏，此番鎮守潮陽，祇因贼將張弘範，聲勢汹湧，本閣誤中牢籠，被他生擒活捉了來，唉！本閣到此地位，無非拚此一命盡忠便了。</p>
<p>（文唱）想本閣平生正直無私曲，一點丹心報宋朝，都只為邊外蒙人侵犯我，山河淪陷恨難消，此番誤入牢籠計，竟披他們活捉牢，我只得拼擲頭顱何足惜，待他年青史把名標，他心頭正在自思想，那知道裏邊弘範請年高。</p>
<p>（表白）張弘範此時身坐营中，相請天祥入內意欲說　，故而見天祥被縛上來，他急忙笑臉相迎，說道——</p>
<p>（張白）文相國在上，弘範多多冒犯虎駕，望老相國恕一個罪罷。</p>
<p>（表白）張弘範一邊說一邊便想向文項相國恭作揖，來解繩案，做出非常誠摯的態度，但是文天祥只是閉目不言．弘範硬又打着哈哈道</p>
<p>（張白）文相國，在下有禮了，哈哈哈，終要請你恕罪的。</p>
<p>（文白）你問我如此恭敬，你叫我做什麼呀？</p>
<p>（張白）哈哈，弘範非為别事，祇因現有你的好友　山張世傑的十分厲害，在下意欲請相國修下一封書信，招他歸降我們元朝，以免本将軍與他交戰了。</p>
<p>（文冷笑介）哈哈哈，你弄錯了？</p>
<p>（文唱）想我是堂堂宋代一忠臣，須要是食君之祿報君恩，我只曉宋朝為父母，父母有時我亦存，今日裹自慚宋室難相保，我身豈肯再偷生，你還要叫我修書友好去，陷人不義是何心，想人生自古誰無死，留取丹青照汗青　，這是我舊時詩句平生志各人有志莫相侵。</p>
<p>（文白）人各有志，你不必多言了，快快與我滾開去吧。</p>
<p>（表白）張弘範見他凜不可犯，只得将他幽禁起來，過了幾天，元朝將　山打破，南宋!元兵營裹大排慶賀筵席，弘範便又請出天祥来，向他說道，</p>
<p>（張白）文先生，你是一個英雄，现在聽我直言諫勸。</p>
<p>（張唱）如今南宋已淪亡，赫赫元朝立大邦，常道逆天難作事，順天行事自能昌，你是個堂堂宋室為丞相，一代英雄名姓揚，倒不如另創一番新事業，投降我主儘無妨，仍可以封官開爵立朝堂，識時势者為俊傑，勸君計議要從長。</p>
<p>（文曰）呀呀呀！呸！你一派胡言亂語，想我文某，豈是朝三暮四之人。</p>
<p>（文唱）忠臣不貳自來言，立志猶如銅鐵堅，想我是既在宋家為宰閣，豈能元代再為官，常言道覆巢之下無完卵，國破安能命苟全，况且是從古中華稱大國，四夷臣服數千年，而今夷狄為天子，我活在人間有何面顏，倒不如一死為乾淨，免得那被人唾罵臭　邊，所以是我們各自為君主，不必胡言像發顛，你要斬時憑你斬，忠臣不怕死黄泉。</p>
<p>（文白）你不必多言，要殺便殺，要剐便剐，想我文天祥非是一般貪生之輩，好利之徒，國不存時生亦無用的了。</p>
<p>（表白）張弘範見他不屈不撓，也沒奈何他，祇得將他解往燕京!元相孛羅也要勸天祥歸降，但是天祥抱着決心。豈肯從順，所以到底被殺在燕京，不過名譽是永遠不會磨滅了。</p>
<p>（表唱）孛羅也要勸歸降，豈料天祥氣昂昂，不屈不撓並不跪，願求速死盡忠亡。孛落明隢難相勸，祇得是幽禁監牢三　長．到後來都城柴市臨刑日，從容就義姓名香。</p>

<h3>讀報門檻（續一）</h3>
<p>— 談天</p>
<p>如何可以教人呢？然而解决小老漢這樣的人的看報門檻，到並不在乎如何精　。只要粗枝大葉的能告訴他鑑別新聞利用新聞和選擇新聞的方法，就够了。又何必一定要有深博學術呢，對了，我就這樣打算和小老漢談看報的門檻。</p>
<p>報紙與新聞　小老漢，你聽我說，你應該每天看報是不是？看報可以曉得國家大事，可以知道未來的禍福，可以作為自己行動的參考。常言道「秀才不出門，能知天下事」。難道你就不想做秀才嗎，你不懂，不要緊，我們每天抽出些工夫，約會幾個人，在你家擱樓上，我們大家來研究研究，不是我吹牛，報上有一個白蝨，我知道牠有條腿，隨便什麼通訊社怎樣，大吹大擂，我可以找出它的狐狸尾巴來，你聽我說，每天晚上。我們來研究，現在我先來講一些山海經給你們聽聽。</p>
<p>什麼叫做新聞</p>
<p>新聞這兩個宇，在一般人看來，是非常熟悉的字，可是問一問新聞的義意，究竟是什麼，恐怕知道的人很少，據說十年前美國國會懸賞徽求過關於新聞的定義，常選的第一名，對新聞的定義，說得頗為詳盡，他說「新聞是一種商品，由報紙分配出去，供給認識文字的人們消費，這種說法，自然是資本家社會的說法，可是召換一個社會，說法又不同了。就眼前的蘇聯來說吧，他們的定義是「新聞是煽動，宣傳組織的武器，像真理報，勞慟者新聞報都以固守自身的階級，摘發社會的不當為宗旨，不是什麼商品，」由此看來，我們可以很清楚的明白「新聞的義意」，牠是跟着時代環境和社會制度的轉換而變動的，老實說，在某種條件之下，新聞就是一國政府領導民眾．鼓舞民眾，教育民眾，結合民眾，以進攻對方的唯一武器。</p>
<p>報紙的功用現在最時髦的說法，是「報紙是人民的喉舌，是社會的公論」。這種說法，我們認為在某種時代裹才可以這樣說，現在我們只能概要的說「報紙是傅達新聞的工具，報紙和新聞都是跟着時代和社會政治制度的變動而變動的，世界上沒有固定的死板不變的事情，這一層，我們必須時時刻刻的認識清楚．這兒不妨再順便說一下報紙的功用，比方說吧，天氣的變化，人事的動靜，報紙每天都有記載，要是不看報的人，去運貸做生意，既不知道天時，又不知道市面，假是某地有匪亂，報上早巳登出。你不看報，貿然前往，豈不是交關危險麼？又，現在上海難民很多，他們有的是上海戰事造成的，有的是內地戰事造成的，假是沒有報紙首先倡導，各界救濟災難，難民豈不是都要餓死麼？此外如國際間事件，也往拄會影響到我們的生活，知道世界大勢的人就有準備應付的方法，一個不看報的人，無論如何，他是要吃虧的，人不看報，便糊塗了一生，凡事都不順利。</p>
<p>新聞的政策</p>
<p>據說從前羅馬皇帝亞力山大第四，為了要防止和羅馬教不同的宗教侵入起見，發下一個取締不法的印刷品法令，當時他認不同宗教的言論為不法，後来這方法流傅到各國，越發擴大的適用於壓制其他一切反對國家外交軍事政治經濟等言論出版物了，到現在已成為政府阻制言論出版的一般法令了。牠限定報紙的新聞，只能登與政府有利的新聞，一切反對的，或含有不法成分的新聞，皆在限制之列，此之謂新聞的政策．牠的限制方法，即是檢查新聞，平常我們看到報上忽然空了一大段（俗名開天窗）即是其例，但言至此處，或許有人問，既然如此，「報紙還有什麼意思呢」不是這麼說的，在一定的範圍內，報紙仍有傳達新聞的價值的，不過不能有聞必錄罷了，但是有鑑別新聞能力的人，仍舊可以看出新聞以外的字句。</p>
<p>新聞的號外</p>
<p>號外兩個宇，一看就可以知道牠不是正常的報紙．牠是一種小型的新聞紙，在時局緊張的時候，忽有特殊變化，而此種新聞，報館又不及等到第二天早晨排出，所以便發行號外，比方說中國軍隊克復廣州，電報一到上海，馬上印有號外出版，但這祇限於報紙所在地的周圍，遠一點市鎮，仍須在第二天報上第一條新聞内才可以看到，不過遲一點罷了。報紙的副刊獨佔報紙半版或一版的副刊，上面登載的完全不是新聞，是一些與歷史地理文藝常識等文字。這是給讀者調劑口胃，並满足知識的所在，所以有人說，報紙是人類知識的寶庫的，即此之謂，此外更有增刊名目。但其內容與副刊差亦有限，不過带些臨時性質就是。</p>
<p>專載與評論</p>
<p>報紙上常有一種單篇文字，或者是名人的文章，或者專家的論著，登載時，大都標明「特載」二字，以示區別，這種文字是供讀者研究參考用的，牠的地位多是在新聞的一角，並不按期登載。至於評論，則每天登載，牠的言論，必然是代表報紙立場，牠的題材，必然與當時的重要新聞有關，所以評論文字，比較為讀者所注意。因為牠不僅能指出事實的變化與因果，還可以指出事實解决的途徑，牠能造成輿論的基礎。</p>
<h3>發明種痘的迦　南</h3>
<p>— Jenner　　之懿</p>
<p>一提起痘瘡（俗名天花），誰都知道是一種極可怕的傳染病。在種痘法沒有發明以前，人類每年死在這種病症中的或變成麻臉的，不知有多少。自然種痘發明後，人類才有了預防和免染痘瘡的方法。</p>
<p>種痘的方法，最早發明要推我們中國了。我國在宋朝就發明，種痘的方法，藉此預防天花，但因方法太麻煩，同時反應太厲害，所以自西洋的，</p>
<p>牛痘術傅入中國後，我國固有的方法就不被醫學界所採用了。</p>
<p>我想我們的讀者，大概都種過牛痘，種過牛痘以後那麼我們對於天花就有免疫性，如果每隔三年種一次，那就不會被染了。今天我們就要来談淡這位發明種痘的救世家！</p>
<p>在沒有發明種痘以前，英國各地也常常有天花的流行，當時有一位英國人迦南先生，看見格蘭斯泰香亞地方的牛，也常患痘瘡，但牠們的痘瘡和我們人類不同，僅限於身體一部分，不擴至全身。母牛的痘瘡大都發生在牠乳部，所以有許多擠牛乳的婦人，常常因手上的皮膚有了創傷，那創口染到牛體所發痘的膿漿，埂發生了少數的痘瘡，但症狀極輕，也不擴至全身，而且，那些會染牛痘的婦女，據說以後都不大會發天花了。</p>
<p>迦南一邊痛恨痘瘡對人類的禍害，一邊又親自見到和聽到這種奇怪的事實，他就想：這真是一個驚人的發見，我為什麼不從這奇特的現象中，去研究出一個預防天花的方法來呢？</p>
<p>迦南最後决意將自己的愛子作試騐品，從患天花的牛乳（乳頭上）採取濃汁移植到他愛子身體上去，當他把針尖刺破他兒子皮膚的時候，他的心如刀切，雙眼含着眼淚他想：萬一我的兒子經種痘後而得痘瘡的免疫性．那麼全世界的人都能得救了，這是多麼偉大的事，若不幸而遭失敗那末我們為世界人類而犧牲，也應毫無後悔，最後他决定把濃汁栘植在他兒子刚破的創口中。他的兒子經過了一天的痛苦，結果祇有那移植的一部份生了膿，形成了一颗痘瘡，並不擴至全身，你想迦南是多麼高興啊。</p>
<p>這次試騐的結果，迦南又繼續地研究了好多年，才證明人類種了牛痘。確能獲得免疫性，不致再感染人痘，他就把這苦心的研究，公佈出來，起初世人尚不深信種牛痘，後來因效果顯著，才被世人所重視。</p>
<p>現在種牛痘巳遍及全世界，各國差不多都有强制人民種痘的法律．我們種了牛痘就可預防天花的傳染。</p>
<p>此時真是佈種牛痘之時，若是没有種過痘的朋友，希望快快去佈種！</p>

<h3>一週戰事</h3>
<p>本週南北各綫，均無大規模戰事，大約日軍在整理。調遣，也未可知，但華軍乘虛蹈隙，處處作消耗之接觸，雖未樹立大功，亦有相當價值，比如</p>
<p>贛北方面</p>
<p>在廬山一带活動之日軍，業已多日，經華軍幾度接觸後，似已失勢，日前又有日軍一部，藉飛機掩護，復向好漢坡方面進發，企圖進據牯嶺．華軍猛力迎擊，於是雙方激戰展開，華砲兵此次發射準確出乎日軍意外，結果日軍只得谈退。都昌戰事，本未平息，華軍乃續圖振作，絕將火　山克復，並與城南湖面之日罩遭遇，雙方皆有損傷，又一部之日軍，在修水北岸，向華軍發砲。該砲多係催淚彈，逼華軍後退，入夜，更有日步兵四五百，分别向山下杜馬村觀音閣附近。搜索前進，有　據涂家埠趨勢，華軍迎頭痛擊，正在　着狀態中。</p>
<p>山西方面</p>
<p>晉柬盤據浮山之日軍，共有千餘人，上餘日來，經華軍不斷襲擊．蒙受相當損失，大部已向西遷。而殘留城內之日軍，仍傅五百餘，前日華軍復分道乘勢圍攻，戰數小時之久，日軍不支，乃向臨汾而去，華軍見日軍已去，遂将縣城克復。晋南安邑．霍縣．臨晋.各地，華日雙方常有接戰，而臨晋之役，有皇協軍蘇超某部千名，槍械本已齊備，伹在華軍追近時，該都忽乘機内應反正，以致日軍前後受擊，損失至為奇重，至於　縣一處，自經華軍克復役，日軍復大舉来犯，此次日方砲火之烈，始巳結成火網，華軍以決死之心，猛力應戰，雙方陣地，出入數次、正僵持之下，另一部華軍乘機反攻靜樂，日軍頗感應付之難。</p>
<p>廣東方面</p>
<p>日軍在粤，近日來調勘频繁，一面加聚構防禦工事，一面更於海南島海口各處，趕修砲台，刻文昌．定安。嵐縣．皆先後　築機場倉庫，打算為空軍根據，似有久違計劃。至於零星戰鬥，華日中軍，曾於順德．神岡．定安．文昌。環山．各地激戰，日機大肆轟炸，早巳引起當地人足憤恨，故有多數民眾，加入軍隊奮勇作戰，頗奏功績，現在日軍全綫，在華軍監視之下，一有活動，即遭襲擊。</p>
<p>鄂中方</p>
<p>鄂中戰事，自鐘祥失陷以後，日軍即積極修築漢宜京鍾兩公路，並趕築洋清（鐘祥東十公里）普門冲（洋梓西北十二公里）一帶工事，從事固守，故週來該方面戰况沉寂，２多　灣日軍，連日不斷向對岸沙洋砲擊，圖施試採，但華軍亦予發砲還擊，且砲竟中日軍火藥庫，一時火焰冲天，不能遏止。此外多實鴻東南港渡口之敵，會在襄河西岸活動，經華軍數度包圍，迄未得逞，　在雙方仍隔河砲戰。日軍　　　河，恐難實現。</p>

<h3>我是難民</h3>
<p>— 難記者</p>
<p>我是難民！</p>
<p>我沒做難民之前，是一個良民，是一個「安分守已」的良民。</p>
<p>然而，現在做了難民了！現在我很覺悟：做一個國民，僅僅安分守已是不够的。</p>
<p>安分守己，彷彿是沒力量的草，又彷彿是散在地上的沙。</p>
<p>大風吹來，草不能不倒，沙也个能不飛走。</p>
<p>所以我做了雖尺，我很幸運，幸運我經過一次的鍛煉，我以後不僅僅是個「安分守己」的良民了。</p>
<p>我希望：我以後要把自己種成有根的樹，風吹不倒；要把自己凝成黏性的土，風吹不散。這，才不枉費同胞們来救我！</p>

<h3>保衛南昌</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>五個月來若斷若被的戰爭，現在又因為敵人的進攻南昌，展開了激烈的局面·當然，敵人的企圖是想中斷浙桂路，將我們的第三戰區和第九戰區隔離開來；此外則與其同盟者及其國人以一種刺激，表示他們還在幹下去，維持他們正在迅速地跌落去的威望。</p>
<p>他們的金圖能吾達到目的，我們暫且不論，可是，即使他們果然中斷了浙桂路，果然使其同盟者及其國人奮興一下，他們究竟將有些什麽可得呢？還不是和以前一樣，多所消耗，正合了我們的願望！我們的佈置，早就到了各自能戰而又在任何環境下都能聯絡的地步，他們要想使我們在軍事上受到打擊，完全妄想。至於他們的同盟者，早就看出他們的無能了，這樣的表示，根本不會有效，否則他們為什麼還要甘詞厚禮，以靑島和加羅林羣島為餌，來相拉攏呢！</p>
<p>不過我們總不能為了這些理由，而减輕我們在南昌的防禦力。反之，我們更應該乘他們的强弩之末，與以嚴重的打擊，使之一蹶不振。他們這决的進攻，差不多國內已無兵可調，而由各地雜湊而來的，這最後的攻勢一過，我可以說，正如迴光返照一樣，亮一下，就要墮入黑暗了，我們就應該把握住這個時機。</p>
<p>他們的進攻，還是老方法：看準了一個地方，調各地方的兵力以赴之；看中了一點，不顧一切地向前突進。現在他們看準的地方是南昌，看中的點是修河、馮水與繚水之間的各要隘·那末我們正可以乘此時機，向他們兵力空處的地方反攻，同時，和台兒莊一樣，與以個別的包圍與消滅。</p>
<p>據今天的消息，我們「分頭反攻，局勢已經穩定」了，我們保衛南昌的目的，不久就可以達到了。我盼望我們的南昌，在各大城市間，一直會和長沙東西並峙着，為粤漢和浙桂兩路上的中流砥往。</p>
<h3>答覆一個日本詩人</h3>
<p>— Rabindranath　Tagor作　哲非譯</p>
<p>（譯者按：本文題名雖然是『答覆一僩日本詩人』，但究其內容，實無異是對日本的全體知識階級的一個總批判。）</p>
<p>你的那封信，眞使我喫　異常。這封信的內容，和我所曉得的日本精神大不相同，而我對你作品的推重，以及我和你的私人關係，本來都是根據此種精神的。</p>
<p>我們想想眞够痛心，法西斯軍事主義的氣焰，竟已侵入到創造藝術家的領域，眞正的知識力量，在戰爭的黑暗之神前面，竟肯犧牲其尊嚴與眞理。</p>
<p>對於斥貴法西斯的意大利屠殺阿比西尼亞，你似乎和我意見一致；但對於數百萬中國人民的虐殺，你就從不同的角度判斷了。你抗議說日本處在一種特殊的地位，可是你忘掉了在每一次戰爭中都有同樣的藉口。熱心的戰爭製造者，常常相信他們的殘暴行為，都是有特別正當的理由的。</p>
<p>你在說起這種方法時，說是『雖恐怖而不可避免』，乃係在亞洲建立一新世界所必要（換句話說，就是濫肆轟炸中國的婦孺，燬滅他們的廟堂和大學，這些就是保持中國之亞洲中國的唯一方法）。</p>
<p>你在信中所稱揚不止的『亞洲人之亞洲』的原理，充滿了歐洲最壞的性質，却全然缺少人類性質中最好的德性——即不顧政治分野的鴻溝，而能把人民統一起來的德性。</p>
<p>當我讀到東京政治家的最近的演詞時，我不禁好笑，他們說：『日本和德意的軍事同盟，是建築在精神和道義的基礎上，並不隱藏有外表的物哲的條件。』藝術家和思想家們居然也採取此種掩飾軍事在暴為精神威武的感淸，眞是荒謬</p>
<p>即使是在戰爭氣狂透頂的時候，也有許多西方的大思想家，揚聲吶喊過羣衆的呼聲，以人道的名義，向戰爭獲利者挑戰；這輩人雖受迫害，但他們決不去賣他們所代表人民的良知。我相信日本也有此種偉大精神的人物存在，但日本的報紙不敢提起他們，因為如果他們不跟從軍事領袖的意旨，他們的命定要歸於消減。</p>
<p>知識階級的叛愛，是我們時代的最大危險象徵之一。</p>
<p>你講起日木窮苦人民的節的，他們的受苦和沉默犧牲，因此你頗驕傲得意，但這一種傷心的犧牲，只是為的侵略鄰國並轟炸敵國人民的家室。我曉得宜傳現在已經成為一種藝術，非民主主義的國家，殆不可能抵抗此種日益侵蝕他們的毒素的誘惑：不過希望『知識階級』還能够保持他們　獨立。不幸實際情形大大不然：在許多虛偽的論爭後面，隱藏着一種頑固的國家主義，强迫今日的『知識階級』去誇張他們的『意識形態』，以强暴的方法，逼迫羣衆向死種進行。</p>
<p>我很深知你們的人民，所以我不相信他們會故意參加此種有祖織的毒害，即將中國的男女牽入鴉片烟和海洛因的苦海中。你們的百姓並沒有曉得這事，可是日本在中國的殖民者却在大規模從事此種燬滅人類的事業。已有許多不可批駁的種種證據證明這種事實，而在日本並沒有發見一聲抗議，就是連詩人也沒有。</p>
<p>在估量你們的知識階級的思維形熊之後，我對於你們政府的許可他們『自由』發表意見，也就不覺得驚異了。我希望他們能秉受他們的自由！</p>
<p>另一種知識階級的叛變象徵，就是他們附和政府破壞鄰國人民的一切生活基礎，而享得政府的優渥待遇。</p>
<p>我曉得有一天你們人民的幻滅感終將到來。那時他們會得明白此决的對華侵略，就是日本武士精神的毀滅，這種毀滅，現在正以殘酷的兇暴進行着。</p>
<p>中國是不可克服的！她的文化，在勇敢的蔣介石將軍保護之下，正在表現着其驚人的豐富性。由於她的人民的忠心，現在已見前所未有的統一，一個新的時期正在中國開始。暫時的戰敗，決不能摧毀她業已醒來的靈魂。</p>
<p>因種種的糾紛，中國常時並沒有準備應付强迫到身上來的戰爭的巨大陷阱，可是現在她確保了她的地位。和日本的軍事科學——在性質上是野蠻的西方式的——相見之下，中國的態度表示了道德的優秀性。</p>
<p>你並沒有認識你們正在自行提高你們鄰國的地位。但這里還有別的考慮，蔣介石夫人在『觀察報」上曾說日本正在創造許多『鬼怪』，破壞中國可紀念的藝術品，毀滅　多無法補救的中國學術機關，虐害和平的社會。</p>
<p>蔣介石夫人會問：『誰會消除道些鬼怪呢？』</p>
<p>我們希望在不久的將來，中日兩國人民能重行携手，將一切過去痛苦的記憶忘掉。那時才能復興眞正的亞洲。</p>
<p>日本的詩人們應該發出他們的呼聲，應該毫不畏縮的確認他們對於人類將來的信心，自相殘殺的科學產物，在這將來不再有其地位。（譯自歐羅巴雜誌）</p>
<h3>亡羊補牢</h3>
<h3>讀書看報心得（上）</h3>
<p>— 吐老</p>
<p>奧國哲學家阿多·魏寗格爾（Otto　Weininger）一生拚命地攻擊女子，他在他底大著「Geschlechtund　Charakter　」裏面用了種種的方法去證明女子不能和男子平等，眞是厲害得很。然而奇怪，據說他著了這部書以後，却煩悶得不得了，而且不久便用手槍自殺了。</p>
<p>中國梁ＸＸ敎授曾經說過：「近代所謂的男女平等運動，其起源即由於不承認男女的差別。」這眞好像是抄襲了那位奧國哲學家底話似的。敎授還主張過：「正當的女子敎育應該是使女子成為完全的女子。」這更加和那位哲學家底主張徹底的一致。</p>
<p>誰說外國有的中國沒有呢？</p>
<p>但兩位底發展各有不同，不過希奇古怪却又一樣：那位奧國學者看不起女子，只看得起男子，可是結果却又看不起實實在在是一個男子的他自己。這位中國敎授大喊着男女要有差別，可是在國難期間，一參議了國政，却又主張趕快「和平一，顯然是要全國底男子，連他自己在內（女子不用說），都無差別」地變成他理想中的女子。——眞是玄妙得沒有辦法解釋，呌人頭昏得很！</p>
<p>前淸能够見皇帝的大官，滿人總自稱為「奴才」，漢人却只能稱臣」。在表面看來，「臣」比「奴才」好像是高尙些，但其實又恰恰相反。「奴才」是皇帝親信的人，「臣却還得看「奴才」底眼色。就是說，「奴才」比「臣」是要高着一等的。</p>
<p>但是不是當時身為漢人的大官覺得有點不舒服呢？我想是會有的。終於也找到透漏這個消息的材料了。</p>
<p>乾隆三十八年十一月戊申上論：「…向來奏摺，滿官率稱奴才，漢官率稱臣，此不過相沿舊例，…初非稱奴才即為親近而盡敬，稱臣即為自疏而失禮也。…嗣後凡內外滿漢諸會奏公事，均著一體稱臣，以昭畫一。著為令」。</p>
<p>這分明是向漢官解釋，呌你們不要吃醋。不過「奴才」依然是不能做，還只好臣下去。</p>
<p>但這條「上諭事實上還是騙騙人的。我們只要查一下後來滿漢大臣底奏摺，便可以明白。中間一個時期，或者眞的也大家都臣」了一下，可是以後，直到淸未，滿大臣還是「奴才」，而漢大臣始終是臣。</p>
<p>自已，兒子，孫子，重孫，玄孫…給一我大清一跪拜了兩百多年，結果却還是一個「欲作奴才而不得」。嗚呼！</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>約定的日子到了，陳鎭長的心頭像有十七八個小鹿在亂撞。結婚的時間定在下午叫時，但狂歡大會在中午便巳舉行。鄕公所裏，筵席從禮堂起，直擺到最後一進，所有Ｘ偽軍，都被招待赴宴，每個人都容許無限制的喝酒。禮堂正中的一桌筵席特別豐盛，是陳鎭長專為款待Ｘ軍官以及宣撫班長和獨眼李而設的，他沒有邀請別的陪客，因為道席酒無異催命酒，他不忍去害無辜的人。</p>
<p>筵　還沒有開始以前，陳鎭長便已把身邊的砒霜交代給一個心腹的打雜老王，呌他把來淘和在酒壼裏，又呌他送酒上來時，在酒壺上做一個暗記，表明那一壺有毒，那一壺無毒。這因為他還存有「瓦全」的心思，想用有毒的酒來毒死那班巨憝大惡，而用無毒的酒來保全自己。</p>
<p>正午時候，鄉公所裹已經坐滿了人，笑語聲，喧譁聲，膨脹得使屋裏容納不下。宜撫班長因為今天是他的喜期，分外快樂，差不多到了得意忘形的地步，不住用手摸着他人中上那一攝小鬍鬚。席上只有陳鎭長一個人是例外，他的心裏沒有快樂，只有麥苦和忙亂，不過為了避免被看出破綻起見，不得不勉强裝出笑容來。到底心裏有事，即使强為歡笑，從外表上看出來，也總覺得有些不大自然。</p>
<p>大家在席上坐定以後，打雜的老王便把兩壺酒送到陳鎭長面前，他受了陳鎮長的囑咐，早在酒壺上做了暗記，那沒有毒的酒壼蓋上，黏有一片小小的紅紙，除了陳鎭長，沒有一個人覺察。陳鎮長忙中有細，他知道純銀的杯箸染了毒會變黑色，所以早就收拾過了，一律換上了玻璃杯和烏木筷。他站起身來，正待代各人斟酒，獨眼李忽然伸手來搶他的酒壺說：</p>
<p>『今天你做丈人，應該安坐，這敬酒的差使，還是讓我代勞了罷。』</p>
<p>『說那里話來，今天你們是客，我是主，豈有反客為主的道理？』陳鎭長執實不肯的說。</p>
<p>其實陳鎭長要是讓獨眼李代為敬酒，或者倒可保自身的安全，因為獨眼李並不知酒裏有作用，即使他先把無毒的酒敬客，輪到敬有毒的酒時，陳鎮長也可以託故不喝；惟其他恐獨眼李識破機關，要自已來敬酒，而又急於圖功，一開始就把有毒的酒敬客，同時因為從未幹過這種事，不免有些膽怯，在敬酒時兩手執着酒壺抖個不住，道就引起了獨眼李的疑心。獨眼李見陳鎭長敬過了各人的酒，壼裹存酒還多，便換了把酒壺來給自己斟，道疑心就更加大了；因此，正當陳鎮長舉杯勸大家喝酒的當兒，他突然喝了聲：『且慢！』把他自己面前的一杯酒，送到陳鎮長面前來說：（四三）</p>

<p>上海特輯</p>
<h3>上海之電訊事業</h3>
<p>— 方子衛</p>
<p>概言</p>
<p>上海為我國最大城市，電訊事業，亦最稱發達。所謂電訊事業，包括範圍甚廣。大別之，可分有綫電和無綫電。凡利用電波遙文字，訊號，言語，音聲，以及傅像，顯影，統稱為無綫電。按我國設置無綫電，創始於光緒三十一年，海軍部設馬可尼式無綫電機於軍艦海容，海琛，海圻，海籌，陆軍都設天津，保定，南苑三處軍用電台。我國無綫電交通，由十八年八月所頒布電信條例之規定，除海陸空軍應用者外，概受交通部管理。本文因限於篇幅，衹述無綫電方面。上海於光緒三十四年，即有無綫電台之設立，卅餘年來長足進步。至八一三前，國內通訊，已可及邊陲各省，城市，國際方面，已遠達歐美，非洲等各國；直通無綫電話者，有日，英，美，德，法，意諸國，業務非常發達，其他供海陸空通訊之用，各有個別不同性質之電台。茲擬就下列各項，分別說明之。</p>
<p>（一）電局電台　我國設置無綫電，垂三十三年。長波時代，電台寥寥，成效不縣。自民國十五年後，短波勃興，成效大著，雖期間會有無綫電二方，為營業上之關係，及交通部與建設委員會之交涉，會引起種種糾紛。為一國電政上不應有之現象；惟彼此競爭，因而各謀改進。廿三年四月一日交通部飭令全國有無綫電合併，上海即成立無綫電總古於老北門民國路，發報機有一五，一〇〇，一〇〇，二五〇，五〇〇華脫等電力，採用波長自二五公尺至一〇五公尺，共有綫路十七條舆全國各地重要城市通報，遠及新疆迪化，及西藏拉薩，且已與漢口廣州互通無綫電話。電報種類，除平常及急電外，　凡新開，氣象，祝賀性質，莫不分門規定價目辦法，社會稱便。</p>
<p>（二）國際電台　上海所設電台，最初之具有國際性質者，當推吳淞無綫電報局之XSG電台，及上海無綫電綫台XSH，因該二台最先與海上各國輪船通報。民國十七年十月國民政府建設委員會，先後向德國德律風根無綫電公司，購買國際支台機器，美國合租無綫電公司，訂購中美電台機器，及法商長途電話公司購買中法電台機器，並勘定上海市真如地方為發報台地點，寶山縣屬劉行鎮為收報台地點，及仁記路沙遜大廈為中央收發室，建國際支台於楓林橋，先與菲列濱，香港，爪哇，正式通報。十八年八月交通部接管後，積極進行，歷年先後（見另表）與世界各洲各國通電報電話，計有綫路十三條，（見另表）通報種類有（一）平常（二）急電（三）新聞（四）公務（五）祝賀（六）函電（七）氣象等。十九年後，營業蒸蒸日上；廿一年每月平均收入十五萬，廿三年每月平均三十三萬，廿四年全年收入六百四十九萬，廿五年全年竟達七百九十六萬。國際無綫電通報，對於二國感情上諒解之增加，及商業之發展，均有密切關係。觀於上述數字，亦可見其一斑。</p>
<p>（三）海岸電台　海岸電台為專供與海上船舶通訊之用。上海之有海岸電台，實起源於吳淞無綫電報局之XSG電台，及上海之XH電台，吳淞電台，肆於的清光緒三十四年，初設於寶由縣風之獅子嶺舆崇明海島無　電台同時成立。其設立原因，實為　時上海崇明間海綫毁斷，用以傳　官商電報。宣統元年，英商匯　旅館，有英人設立無綫電台與海面船隻通報，時郵傳部　　　司長蔣尊　與英公使愛特交涉，收歸我國政府自辦，附設於四馬路，即今之上海電報局內。民國三年，歐戰初期，法人在顧家宅法國軍營內建設電台　FZ，並在伯諾公會註冊，公然收發商電及船舶電報，每月收入有五千元之譜。民國四年，交通部向德商西門子洋行購五啟羅華脫火花閒隙式發報機，開始與中外船舶通報。十八年以業務發達，加裝德律風根新式　啟羅華脫真空管發報機及新式收報機。其間除上海電台XSH經拆除外，該台直至二一八毁於戰役，後經交通部與美商大來洋行訂約在虹橋建設新台；至此始成為純粹海岸電台，專供船舶通報只用．八一三後，遷廣東路，該台關係海上生命財產之安全，商旅之便捷。廿二年世界無綫電發明家馬可尼氏來華後，返國途中，在意輸康脫盧棱號上，拍作者轉上海十四科學團體謝電，即傅遞由該台而來者。</p>
<p>（四）船舶電台　我國上船之建設無綫電太者，以華甲華乙為最早。自交通部令飭船舶儎重逾五百噸者，應裝無綫電後，上年来華商輪船均先後遵令設置．上海商業發達，進出海港船噸為數　鉅，船舶電台屬移動性質，交通部飾令電局管理之。</p>
<p>（五）專用電台　專用電台，為各特殊機關，及大企業，經政府認可自設之電台，專為本身業務通報。上海之有專用電台。除海陆軍外，當以民國十七年之輪船招商局及中央銀行二機關為最早：招商局總台設四馬路外灘局址内，與南京分局電台及江海各輪船電台通報；中央銀行總台設九江路行址內，與各地中央銀行通報．十八年後，相繼成立者有財部駐滬電台，設中央銀行内；中國航空公司歐亞航空公司電台，先後設於虹橋飛機場及龍華航空港，與南京．北平．西安．漢口．重慶．成都．昆明．廣州．香港．等航空站。及二公司所有三十餘隻飛機通報。又江海關設電台於虹口，與沿海各地海關及所屬巡艦通報：濬浦局設電台於定海州，與揚子江口，挖泥船電台通報；京滬滬杭甬鐵路局亦自設電台與沿綫各大站通報。</p>
<p>（六）廣播電台　上海之有廣播電台，遠在民國十三年。當時永安公司在南京路公司屋頂花園設台，經交通部飾令制止。嗣美商開洛公司在福開森路設二五〇華脫電力窗台。民十九年後，中外私人及團體設立者甚多，竞達五十餘處。惜地方當局缺乏相當管理，以致設備簡陋，質量不佳，而尤以電波干擾為最嚴重。民國廿年十一月經交通部審查取締，分配週率，加以限制，存在者計二十餘台。廿三年交通部建上海廣播電古，以資率领。廿五年市政府亦自設廣播電台於市中心區，自此上海即有公私設立廣播電台三十三處，電力自一五華脫起，有三〇、五〇，一〇〇、二〇〇、二五〇、及五〇〇華脫，採用週率目五七〇至一四八〇千週，為全國廣播電台最多之城市。</p>
<p>（七）氣象電台　上海徐家匯天文台法神父，於民元時，即備有收報機，專為接收歐美大電古報告時間電訊。民國三年法台FFZ成立，天文台氣象所之每日氣象報告，助由該台播送。時間為上午十一時五十五十五分，下午四時五十五分，數十年如一日，航行船舶，實利賴之。十三年，吳淞海岸電台XSG亦開始廣播氣象，十七年後輪船招商局電台及海軍部海岸巡防處電台，亦相繼規定時間廣播氣象．廿二年四月，江海關為便利航輪起見，特在六戢山．花鳥島．佘山三處燈塔，設無綫電台導電台，定時播發氣候并發暴風濃霧警告，俾航輪有所準備，波長為一〇〇〇公尺。</p>
<p>（八）業餘電台　業餘電台為業餘研究無綫電者所設．上海之最早業餘研究者，為民初時，南洋大學生某君，嗣後國人研宄者漸眾，民國十八年有中國中華業餘無綫電社之組織，各有社員達三百餘人，有業餘電台三十餘處；同時上海外人方面，亦有萬國業餘無綫電會之組織，有會員數十人，業餘電台二十餘處。該業餘電台等均時時與世界各國業餘家通報。一二八、八一三戰役，以上海新聞供給世界，頗著時譽。</p>
<p>（九）電信教育　電信教育實為電訊事業之推動原力。我國之有公　電信教育機關，當以前郵傳部之電報練習所為最早．入民國後，經改為電信學校，校址即在南市王家碼頭。惜廿三年停辦，前後有五十餘年歷史，過去電信人才，多出身於該校。其他有民十八年建設委員會之無綫電訓練所，亦造就人才不少。私立者當推中國無綫電工程學铰為最早，該校成立於民國十三年，在交通部立案：十餘年來，畢業學生，千數百人，現皆在海陸空軍政公私機關服務。十八年後，私立者有中華.交通．南洋．三國，建華等，惜均經中輟或停辦，出身其間者，亦復不少，成績卓著。</p>
<p>（十）電信機械　電訊事業所需之機械，我國最初皆購自外國，所費茜鉅。後交通部在上海設電報機器修理所，嗣故霹電信機械製造廠。十七年建設委目會，在交通大學内設無綫電櫗製造廠，後改為電機製造廠設南市。惜不久先後停辦。此外民營者，有大華科學　器公司，大華無綫電公司，利達公司，亞洲公司等。十飲年來，製造出品亦不少。上海電信機械製造事業，以過去情形觀察之，将來實為一甚有發展希望之實業。</p>
<p>上海地方情形特殊，電信事業，因而複難。民廿年來，漸趨正軌．惜八一三後，呈混亂现象，變遷異常。本文所述，僅以戰事以前情形為止；并對於外人以及各國海陸軍所設電台，亦未述及，讀者幸在意之。</p>

<h3>上海出租汽車業概況</h3>
<p>— 沛棠</p>
<p>上海居東亞首埠，人烟稠密，商業繁盛，足與世界各大都市相伯仲，非惟國人中冠盡雲集，即歐美人仕為經商而僑居者亦紛至沓來，因與歐美人仕交往既多，相處一隅，風俗習惯亦漸染歐化，而西方之代步利器－汽車，於是時出现，滬上乃有創辦出租汽車之開始，迨至民國成立，滬埠商業益盛，所需求於交通益繁，出租汽車應時而興，遂成為供應社會之四大要素之一。茲筆者爰就記憶所及，草此「上海出租汽車業概況」一文，以供諸君於茶餘酒後聊佐談資。</p>
<p>創始時期　本埠之有出租汽車者，實肇始於民國兀年（公歷一九一一年）其時應用之車輛，皆為皮篷車（即後稱為篷車者），前後俱用油燈而無保險楨，水箱頭尚包以銅皮，呈方形，手煞車則裝置於車身外踏腳板上，若遇天兩猶無拭水器之設備，祇塗少許肥皂於風窗玻璃上（其時尚無保險玻璃發明），以免雨沾而己。即車胎之状亦與今迥異，其輪檑概以木製，橡皮胎之叫週光滑而無齒紋。至引擎之發動猶須賴人手搖之。車身亦無如今之寬敞舒適，至於如車內之小座位。拉手攀等設備　論有之，一切惟覺簡陋而已。於此可見當時車輛之一般情形也。而最早經營俱業者，推為南京路，勞合路附近之平洽門汽車行及泥城橋畔之事茂汽車行，可謂滬地有出租汽車之嚆矢。訂定之車價以五元為一小時，二元為半小時計算．然經營伊始，殊無獲利可言，蓋社會人仕均不識此為交通利器，反多眾口交貶，成認此種為譎麗之奢侈品。多不敢問津者，偶遇年節假期，即或有人使用，亦均為富室子弟及北里中人。然大半社會人仕尚不敢試用也。緣至民國二三年間復有飛隆，億太出租汽車公司出現；其後尚有東方．中央，飛星，怡昌等數家均以經售汽車而　營出租。富時之汽油價格每介侖約八九角，而風行之車以奥佛蘭，道奇，福特，司蒂蓓克等牌子為最。惟當時車租，並未劃一，有者根據時間計算（如每一小時五元，半小時二元）然亦有根據次数而計算者，如至北新涇，龍華，江灣等處，車租非大洋五元不可，故當時出租汽車之未能為各界普遍服務，最貴實其致因也。</p>
<p>全盛時期　民國八年，出租汽車業驟呈蓬勃氣象，如雲飛，環球，探勒，利利等各大車行相機崛起，局面為之一新。而僅擁車數輛之小車行尤如雨後春筍，紛紛創辦。至同時各大車行以應各界人仕需求起見，雖擇住宅區从商業區添設分站，並將約各大公司商號及娛樂場所另設代叫處以廣營業，至車租亦趨統一，改為每小時三元，每二十分鐘為一元，而當時肥埠四週馬路之舆築成功車行範圍之廣拓，賞有助於出租汽車業之發展也，至此社會人仕已轉變其住昔之眼光，始知出租汽車為唯一代步之利器矣。</p>
<p>至民國十六年間，市政當局，因鑒市上出租汽車往來頻繁，與社會關係日見密切，遂予注意，特訂定新章以便管理。如在舊城廂區內行車須另捐車照，並將出租汽車之車照一律改為白牌黑字，以資識別，為免除每一捐領之車照有任意頂替之弊更於車內門另裝一小照會以為防範，在每单捐領車照時又須將車称衡重量，以定車捐之多寡。又命每車裝傭不同音之喇叭兩種，以作警告路人安全之需，並於司機人座前添置式車鏡以便倒車時窺視後方有無障碍之用，凡此數端皆為當時市政當局所欲各車行改進車務之措施也。其時各車行因社會需求之故，加以汽油價格跌至每介侖為五角七分，莫不營業鼎盛，又有月宫，南方，祥生，黄汽車，華北等新車行乘機創立，此時可謂滬上自有出租汽車業以來之全盛時代。</p>
<p>衰落時期　迨至「一二八」事變後，出租汽車業遂一落千丈，汽油價格又漲至一元左右，一般較小之車行因虧蝕甚鉅無法維持而相機休業者實不在少數。即規模較大之車行亦莫不呈顯動搖之象，此殆可謂本埠出租汽車之衰落時期歟？</p>
<p>最近時期　最近數年來，因法幣制度　固，百業漸趨繁榮，出租汽車業又重見轉機，而允推雲飛，祥生，泰來三車行規模最大，組織完備。於民國二十四年間復有戰後規模最大之銀色汽車公司創辦，至此遂有滬上四大出租汽車行著稱。近年來各車行設備管理較前史為週密，為保障顧客安全起見，除將所有車輛每週舉行檢驗外。並保有車險，以策意外。</p>
<p>二十六年夏一度有法人主辦之小型出租汽車出現於本埠第二特區內，始創以行駛路碼之多寡而計車租，旋因鑒於未能適應顧客之需要，故不久自動停辦。</p>
<p>「八一三」後，滬地四週交通斷絕，路綫為縮短不少，又因外匯高漲，汽油價格竟騰貴至每介侖一元四角。其他如車胎及汽車零性價格亦莫不上漲數倍，至於新車售價亦增倍　，如民國十四五年間每輛約二三千元，現非六七千元以上不辦，職是之故各出租汽車業為維持成本計，遂於二十七年八月一日起公議一致漲價二成。故目前之車租已定為每二十分鐘為一元一角，每小時為三元六角。</p>

<h3>張伯倫舞</h3>
<p>— 戈兒</p>
<p>張伯倫是英國的首相，而「張伯倫舞」者，乃法國舞界最近流行的一種「舞術」也。據說這種「張伯倫舞」正如目前上海的舞場所流行的「倫勃斯華克」一樣，轟動一時，而又競相傚尤。</p>
<p>法國舞界之所以有「張伯倫舞」的「發明」者，因為這位身為英國首相的張伯倫老先生，出門喜帶雨傘，而又更加酷爱「世界和平」的緣故，因此頗受一般「反對戰爭」的人們所擁護。</p>
<p>以上所說的「反對戰爭」的「人們」，是和英美法等國反法西斯華眾舉行游行示威運動的人們的「反對戰爭」，是完全不相同的，前者的「反對戰爭」，因為可以保持他們的「享樂縱慾」的生活，「舞場」當然是他们「享樂縱慾」的最好場所之一，張伯倫老先生的「酷爱和平」，保持「世界和平」，而得以使「戰爭」不敌「爆發」，舞場闊少的發明「張伯倫舞」以為酬答，這真是所謂「理所當然」，也是「義不容辭」的了。</p>
<p>這些都是「鐵的事實」：前些時候，希特勒元首把奥地利在舉行「公民投票」之下「收歸」德國之後、接着便是把蘇台德區也來了一套「老公式」而「收歸」了去，法蘭西小姐的眼睛中，的確發出嬌怒的光輝，大有脫下一跳舞絲　要和希特勒元首講一講斤頭的樣子，要不是酷爱和平的張伯倫老先生「東奔西走」，盡了「和平之鸽」的「偉大使命」，那末，法蘭西小姐的「跳舞絲　」是早已脫下了，然而這樣可不是不能「跳舞」了麽？</p>
<p>现在，希特勒元首居然把不是日耳壘族的捷克也收在他的「保護」之下了，張伯倫老人雖然酷愛气和平」，然而「是可忍孰不可忍」呢？因此，竞連蘇聯提議的召集六國會議，也認為「緩不濟急」，「為時尚早」等等，而不加贊同，却認為很「濟急」的要算是廣泛的發一通「宣言」了。而今天呢，連「濟急」的「宣言」也不必要發了，當然，依照目前情势看來，希特勒元元首既已和羅馬尼亞訂定「蠻公平」的「商約」，欧陸的「戰雲，是又因希特勒元首的「適可而止」而「消滅」了，「宣言」的發表「為時尚早，，豈不然乎？」</p>
<p>「世界和平」又得以「保持」，法國舞界的「張伯倫舞」應該跳得更為「瘋狂」，這才足以表示出「承平氣象呢。</p>
<p>現正把「張伯倫舞」的「方式」紹介於後，供給一股「愛好和平」的「跳舞朋友」作一麥考：「當男女對對起舞之後，由一男賓右膀上掛一雨傘，則此男賓得向同舞的任何一對中選擇一位最中意的女賓，趨前邀她垂青，並隨手將雨傘鉤於此女之男伴右膀上，即可不顧該男伴之樂意與否，狂舞一番了，但得傘之男賓，亦可依法行之，故循環不已，頗僥倖趣」。</p>
<p>「張伯偷舞」的「頗饒興趣」是一定的，讓我們看這「張伯倫舞」的流行吧！當然，這是要閉起眼睛不看希特勒元首才好。</p>
<h3>上海劇藝社的新動向</h3>
<p>— 宗怡</p>
<p>上海劇藝社自從成立到現在只有過三次公演，而每一次公演總要相隔三四個月。這原因很多。不過這些原因中間，以外來的理由為多，１如戲院的不容易租到，真是話劇運動前途最大的障礙。去年年底不是乘卡爾登封箱期間趕演了「花濺淚」，在公共租界简直沒有一個比較適當的場所給我們演出，法工部局禮堂雖然可以商借，但只能演法國戲還能得到租費上的優待，演中國戲或英美的劇本就須付全租，而坐位有限，在那裏演出實在太不上算。但從此為了没有場所就停止演出麼？這怎麼可以！當然我們要竭力繼續爭取演出的埸所，我們繼續的排練大戲；正在預備中的有「生財有道」和「祖國」兩戲，好在牠們都是法國戲，萬一找不到適富的大戲院，仍舊叮以在法工部局禮堂演出。但是我們決不能再讓劇社工作再作三四個月的耽擱下去，我們必須迅速地繼續演出，於是我們決定作星期日早場的公演。並且決定了十多個小戲，接續的排下去，眼新光大戲院出訂了四侗月的合同，每星期日得和上海的爱好話劇的觀眾見一次面。這是我們星期日小公演的第一個意義</p>
<p>星期小公演在上海已有一年多歷史了，觀眾都覺得利用這假日的短短的時間，非常經濟，非常適當，不過以前的小公演，一般的批評大多是草率從事，成績不甚好。我們想来提倡一下，提高演出的水準。我們選擇劇本非常嚴格，我們挑選演員和導演，都跟大戲一樣的慎重。我們最先兩次演出的節目，導演，和演員的支配，你們看過之後，一定會明白我們這次小公演的第二個意義了。</p>
<p>不断地有許多新人加入劇藝社，我們很想給他們一點訓練，但為了時間和經濟的限制，無法實行出来。我們就決定拿星期小公演作為新人訓練的模標．我們頭幾次的演出角色導演都是本社的先進人材，在舞台上現身說法，作新進人員的訓練的教材，以後漸漸在新人中選拔出來，充實我們演員的陣容。這是我們星期小公演第三個意義。</p>
<h3>「天涯情侶」觀後</h3>
<p>— 如華</p>
<p>“Trade　Winds”</p>
<p>聯美公司出品</p>
<p>「天涯情侣」是一支溶戀愛與偵探於一爐的喜劇，和瑪琳黛德麗的「欲望」是差不多。一個探員怎樣跟踪在一個兇手的後面，而那兇手是一位年輕漂亮的金髮女郎，因為是喜劇，當然是「締結良緣」的，於是在END之前再找出另外一位兇手來使他們「一舉兩得」。但是在看完了「天涯情侣」，即使降到最低的希望，它是不及「欲望」，果然「欲望」也並不有一些什麼給我們。這裏，劇作者是顯示了两個缺點：</p>
<p>第一，他是儘量想把故事熱鬧，所以，案子發生之後，他就把這位當作兇手的金發女郎凱（瓊裴納）從舊金山帶到火奴魯魯，大阪，上　，西貢，新加坡……等地，而讓奉命緝兇的探員沙　（蒴德立馬區）也跟踪着團團轉。這樣寫法，熱鬧異然是熱鬧了，而且介紹了各地風光，使觀眾有新奇的感覺，然而回時發生的難問题也就在這裏，使許多戲都　做了過場戲問题也就在這裏，使許多戲都　做了過場戲，使演員的情緒不能統一發展。</p>
<p>第二，介紹沙姆出場的時候，他不是一個以戀愛作鉤饵而做職務上的手段的探員，而確是一個「調情聖手」，所以和凱發生情感是可能的，但是在他請求賞金，和得了賞金以後的得意之狀的中間，缺乏他成竹在胸」的過程，這不但沙姆本身的性格有些飄忽不定，同時最後的破案也是兀突得很。這或許是一般偵探片的「故弄玄虛」，但這「故弄玄虛」是「弄巧成拙」的。</p>
<p>在演出上講，沙姆和凱秘密至孟買結婚，另一探員追踪而来，凱被　，這裏戲的開展已達到了最高潮，最後的破案也同樣勉強的。</p>
<p>導演者Tay　Garnett是相當努力的，如沙姆追踪凱趵時候，各個表示地方性的畫面是接繼得非常簡明的，兩個滑稽人物的安插一個沙姆的女書記琪恩——安蘇緩，一個是助手博羅格特—（賴甫白萊梅）也很自然。瓊裴納的演技是進步的，有好多場戲她都能演得非常動人。　德立馬區從　倩女還魂」，「情　飛繞」及這部「天涯情侶」中，他是多少改變了以前的作風的，但這改變作風一是並沒有成功，反而是失敗的。</p>
<h3>中華慈幼協會</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>在抗戰中救濟了無數的難童</p>
<p>不但收養着並使他們受教育</p>
<p>兒童是國家的未来的主人翁，尤其是中國，正需要着新人的才力，來負起從事戰後建設工作的使命。因此，我們對於兒童是應得隨時隨地注意着他們的健康，不要斷丧了他們的小生命，做父母的更得謹慎的管教他們。在我們的记憶上，關於慈幼問題，過去上海有一個中華慈幼協會，對這方面是相當努力，會有不少兒童受到中華慈幼協會的恩施。</p>
<p>中華慈幼戲會的會所，在博物院路一三一號，是由熱心慈幼問題的中外人士所組織而成。行政院長孔祥熙，就是該會的會長，副會長是羅運炎和赫滿克夫人．此外牛惠生夫人，王孝英女士，李廷安，李登輝，法籣克霖夫人，陳鶴琴，　永建夫人，趙晋卿，劉王立明等，都是中華慈幼協會的委員。這樣的一個慈善機關，有那麼多名流碩彦贊助，會務的發展，造福幼童，是可以推想的。</p>
<p>「八一三」之前，中華慈幼協會工作範圍很廣：在辣麥德路没有上海慈幼教養院，收容無依靠的弧兒孤女，與以相當的教育，俾長大而後，得能自立，成為健全的國民．在閘北設有一所贫兒醫院，貧苦的兒童，害了病都可免費施診，施藥。為促進兒童的健康起見，每年聯合各團體，各衛生機關舉行兒童健康比賽。關於出版方面，有定期刊物「現代父母」月刊，專戰關於育兒問題的文章，灌輸父母教育使一般的父母，都能注意到育兒問題的重要，而有充分的育兒新知識，其他的各種工作還多，祇是筆者一時記不起，祗得從略了。</p>
<p>上海發生了戰事之浚，為了日本飛機的到處轟炸，戰區之中，天真活潑的兒童，失去了家，離散了父母的，不知有多少。更有一部分難重，羅在難民之中，逃亡到租界上面。於是中華慈幼協會的工作，也就格外的緊張。在極司非而路聖約翰青年會中學，設一難童收容所，不但把難童收養着，同时更使他們受到教育。設立許多難童學校，闸北貧兒醫院的醫生，更輪流到各收容所為病兒診治。在慕爾鳴路，更設一難童醫院。所設的貧兒教養院，也由閘北撤到租界，在卡德路王家沙花園繼續工作。工作的範圍既這樣廣，在戰事期間，工作又這樣的緊張，自然需要相當的經費。而該會所有的經費，完全由會員中熱心的人士所捐助的。戰事離開上海之後，中華慈幼協會在租界上面，大部分的工作，還是在繼續下去。不久之前，更會製就大批寒衣，分發流这兒童。環境雖是如此，他們對於慈幼事業還是如此熱心，是值得我們欽佩的。不過最近中華慈幼協會的會所，已遷往重慶。在上海，祗是設一分辦事處而已。</p>
<p>中華慈幼協會的工作，在這一回的戰事中，更本限於上海，凡是在戰區之中，或是後方的要地，該會都派員實地工作，救濟一般無家可歸的難童。遠至蘭州，西安，鄭州，洛陽等地都成立分會，積極的從事慈幼工作。戰區兒童獲得該會的救濟，因而免於死亡者，真不可勝數呢！</p>

<p>因為這個育嬰院內的孩子，大都是人家寄養的多，難得有幾個沒有父母，沒人受領的。有的是母親已死，父親別有職業，不能撫養孩子，就寄託到這個育嬰院來了。有的是父親已死，母親要謀職業　口，不能撫養孩子，也寄託到這兒來了。也有的父母俱存，但家中小孩子太多，不能撫育，像這位方警官的一胎三兒，只好送到此地。也有的父母雙亡，或父母都「失踪，另有第三者，送到這裏來的。形形色色，各種各樣的孩子都有。但寄養在育嬰院的，照例應收報酬，不然這三百多嬰兒，前年這筆經費着實可觀，誰出這筆經費呢？况且父母生了兒女，父母應得担任教養的責任，無論那一種制度的國家，都是一樣。不過另有一種沒有父母，或是父母雖有，而不能撫育孩子的，國加或是地方上，設立了一種兒童公育院。在戰後，我們中國却也設立了不少，名目也至不一：有的叫做孤兒院，有的叫做難民兒童教養院。這些機關，大概一班慈善家，瞧着孩子們可憐，公共捐助設立的．後來通統改為兒童公育院，歸國家指派地方上設立。不問他們的父母是何人，籍貫在那裏，他是中國人，便是中國的國民一份子。這些兒童公育院，與此間安樂鎮章文綺醫師等所辦的育嬰院不涉。因章女醫師等所辦的育嬰院，雖不能說是貴族化。却是設備較後，待遇較佳，本不是慈善性質，他不是個公育機關咧。朱愛人引導了她們兩人道：「我們第一步，先去看看幼稚園。」那時便到幼稚園來，夠得上入幼稚園的，約有六十餘人。她們分為四組，每組是十六七人，大的是六歲，小的是四歲。像葉初青醫師的兩個小孩子，都在其內，那小弟弟是六歲，小妹妹是四歲。不過到了明年，那位小弟弟，就到了初小年齡，要另外想法子了。幼稚園既名為國，却是是一方園地，也有些樹木。這些樹木上，都褂上了一塊木牌，木牌上，寫着某年某月某日種的什麼樹，再生明是何人種的。據說是一個幼稚生，臨到離開了幼稚園，去進初小的時候，都要種一棵樹，以為紀念。</p>

<p>Entire Regiment of Chinese Troops Defending Wucheng Dies Heroically from Poisoning</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guilin Telegram: Northern Jiangxi is now the center of a major battle. The invading Japanese troops are mostly elites drawn from various locations, with fresh troops as reinforcements. Therefore, the fighting is fierce, unprecedented since the second phase of the War of Resistance. The Japanese army launched a large-scale offensive starting on the 20th. After crossing the Xiu River, the main force suffered a severe blow from the Chinese army in the area of Zaijia Mountain, Mantou Mountain, and Fozu Mountain, with more than a thousand casualties. Fierce fighting also broke out on both sides of Wanjiafu on the 24th, and a stalemate continued until the 25th. Japanese troops landing on the west bank of Poyang Lake in the east were annihilated by the Chinese army at Shizi Mountain, with more than two hundred killed, three Japanese warships sunk in the lake, and eight destroyed. Wucheng was bombed by Japanese aircraft and turned into scorched earth. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chongqing Telegram: The war situation in Northern Jiangxi is improving. The Chinese army launched a counter-offensive in the northeast of Wuning, engaging in fierce fighting for two days and nights, annihilating nearly a thousand Japanese troops. The Japanese troops attacking Wanjiafu and Anyi have been repelled. The Japanese troops attacking Wucheng eventually invaded. In this campaign, the Japanese army suffered more than two thousand casualties in seven days. Japanese troops harassed Fengxin between Anyi and Jing'an and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. A fierce battle broke out between Chinese and Japanese troops at the Feng'an Railway Station on the Nanchang-Xunyang Road. The highway between Gao'an and Shanggao was heavily bombed by a large number of Japanese aircraft yesterday. The Japanese army declared that it aims to advance on Nanning in the south, Xi'an in the north, and Nanchang and Yichang in the center. The Chinese army is preparing to fight and is taking strict precautions. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Dongxiang: This morning, the Chinese army launched a large-scale counter-offensive against the Japanese troops in Anyi. The Japanese troops are stubbornly resisting in the city, and the fighting is extremely fierce. (26th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese reports, the entire regiment of Chinese troops in the Battle of Wucheng was sacrificed, and the Japanese army also suffered more than two thousand casualties. It is reported that the Japanese army fiercely attacked Wucheng for a week, but ultimately failed to take it. Early Friday morning, the Japanese army released poison gas. The defenders of Wucheng, about a regiment of men, continued to fight bravely in the poison gas. By 4:00 PM, the Chinese army's defenses were breached, and the Japanese army stormed into the city. A fierce street battle ensued, resulting in the sacrifice of the entire Chinese regiment, none of whom abandoned the city to escape. (26th Associated Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Tu Jiabu on the front line of the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway is still being held by the Chinese army. The situation remains the same. This morning, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on Laoyazui, but was met with a head-on blow from the Chinese army and routed. (26th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The Chinese defending forces east of the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway launched a large-scale counter-offensive against the Japanese troops near Anyi yesterday afternoon, gaining overwhelming momentum. Important strongholds such as Hushan and Fenghuang Mountain, five miles northwest of Anyi County, were successively recovered. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to continue advancing towards the county seat. (26th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The Japanese troops on the left flank of the Nanchang-Xunyang line, in Anyi and Jing'an, are advancing south along the highway and are currently engaged in fierce fighting in the Wannian Palace and Wushanpu area. (26th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to news received here, the Chinese army is now engaged in a desperate battle to stop the Japanese army from advancing on Nanchang, and admits that the Japanese troops advancing along the Nanchang-Xunyang highway have reached Wangjiapu. The area has many small hills and is now the last line of defense for the Chinese army north of Nanchang. The Chinese side considers this location to be the throat of Nanchang. Although the Japanese army's offensive is fierce, the Chinese high command has ordered the Chinese army to defend Wangjiapu at all costs to protect Nanchang. As of noon yesterday, Wangjiapu was still in the hands of the Chinese army. It is reported that the Japanese army has advanced to Feng'an Station on the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway, where battles are currently underway. The Japanese troops encircling the left flank of the Chinese army have reached Anyi and Fengxin and are still advancing south along the main highway connecting Nanchang and Changsha, heading towards Gao'an. Gao'an was heavily bombed by 48 Japanese aircraft yesterday. Another team of Japanese aircraft bombed Zhangshu and Qingjiang. The former is on the highway from Nanchang to Ji'an, and the latter is on the railway from Nanchang to Hunan. The Japanese aircraft are clearly trying to cut off traffic between various places and Nanchang. It is reported that Wucheng on the west bank of Duyang Lake fell on the 24th of this month. The Xinhua Daily today published an article commenting on the Battle of Nanchang, stating that the Japanese army's invasion of Nanchang aims to cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and block traffic between the provinces of Jiangxi and Zhejiang and the Chinese interior. At the same time, after the Japanese army occupies Nanchang, it can carry out a large-scale suppression of the Chinese guerrillas active in the Nanjing, Wuhu, and Shanghai areas, as they will no longer be able to communicate with the rear. After the Japanese army occupies Nanchang, it can also threaten Changsha, as occupying Changsha is part of the Japanese strategy to open the Yuehan Railway. The newspaper predicts that the Chinese army in the Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhu areas will launch a large-scale offensive in the coming days to put pressure on the Japanese army's rear and will organize the people of Jiangxi Province to carry out guerrilla warfare. (26th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to reports from the Chinese side, the Japanese authorities are currently using three divisions to launch a fierce attack on Nanchang. These three divisions are the 6th, 101st, and 106th divisions. (26th Associated Press Telegram)</p>
<p>Xiushui: The 6th Division of the Japanese army, which invaded Wuning from Xijingkou (i.e., Jinkou), has suffered heavy casualties in recent days due to the brave resistance of the Chinese army in the Guancaishan area northeast of Wuning. The Japanese army's attempt to invade Wuning seems to have realized the difficulty and temporarily retreated. The majority are now invading Dongkou from Dengxi to the south, and another part is still invading Luoping from Zhelin, appearing to be coordinating with Jing'an. Fierce fighting broke out in Dongkou and Luoping on the 26th. (26th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The Japanese troops invading Wuning from Jin Kou because the mountain roads are rugged, in a dilemma of advance and retreat, and are currently entrenched in the Tong Kou Luo Ping area three or four from the south bank of the Xiu River, in fierce battles with the Chinese army.

<h3>The Japanese Army's Use of Poison Gas to Force a Crossing of the Xiu River</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) The Chinese army on the Xiu River front occupied several strongholds on the north bank southeast of Yongxiu and east of Qiujin, posing a threat to the Japanese army. At about 10:00 PM on the 17th, the Japanese army suddenly gathered four to five hundred men and launched four attacks on the Chinese-held north bank of Xia Shan under Tu Jiabu, all of which were bravely repelled by the Chinese defenders. The Japanese army then released a large amount of poison gas from near Guanyinge and Chencun on the north bank to cover their crossing of the river. Although some of the Chinese defenders were poisoned, they still held the river bank. From 12:00 AM on the night of the 17th to the morning of the 18th, the Japanese army made three attempts to cross the river by force, but were all repelled. The Japanese army then used artillery fire and poison gas to cover the construction of pontoon bridges near the railway line, and more than a thousand men crossed the river one after another and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese side. By the 19th, the Japanese army had invaded Dawangmiao, Weicun, and Dalu * six or seven miles north of Tu Jiabu. On the night of the 19th, the Chinese army launched a counter-offensive against Dalu *, with the area being lost and regained five or six times. The area has become scorched earth, but it is still being held by the Chinese army. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered two to three hundred casualties, and dozens of Japanese soldiers were captured alive. On the Chencun side northwest of Tu Jiabu, the battle between the Japanese and Chinese armies on the night of the 19th was even fiercer than before. Chencun is still being firmly defended by the Chinese army. Unable to succeed, the Japanese army turned from Tu Jiabu to launch a forced crossing between Yongxiu and Qiujin. On the night of the 20th, the Japanese army divided into four routes to launch a forced crossing to the south bank, one route crossing the river near Gouziling in Yongxiu, another route crossing the river in Liuzhuang, another route crossing the river in Liaojia, and another route crossing the river in Huaguowei. When crossing the river, the Japanese army used intense artillery fire and released a large amount of poison gas to cover their movements, causing more than a thousand Japanese troops to cross to the south bank of the Xiu River. The Japanese troops who forced the crossing in Liuzhuang and Liaojia continued to invade west to the Shizi Mountain and Taiziling area. Forced to do so, the Chinese army transferred the defenders of the Zhanggongdu south of the salient. By the morning of the 21st, another two hundred or more Japanese troops crossed the river from Outang City on the north bank, and then hundreds more crossed the river. The Chinese army resisted step by step in Fengqishan, Yanjielong, Zhu Zhuang, and other areas, annihilating many Japanese troops. By the afternoon of the 21st, the Japanese army continued to add a regiment of troops and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese Tan Xi direction. On the morning of the 22nd, the Chinese and Japanese armies engaged in fierce fighting in the Dazhun Bridge area north of Tan Xi for half a day. By the afternoon of the 22nd, the Japanese army continued to reinforce and released a large amount of poison gas to launch a fierce attack on the Chinese army. The defenders of the Chinese position sacrificed heroically and transferred to the high ground south of Tan Xi to hold their positions. (25th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chongqing Telegram: There were still major battles in northern Jiangxi on the 26th. Due to heavy casualties, the Japanese army continued to transfer troops from Jiujiang to reinforce various routes. The Japanese troops near Fengxin and Anyi attempted to attack Gao'an, but were intercepted by the Chinese army and failed to advance. The Chinese and Japanese armies are still engaged in fierce fighting north of Lehua Street and Qiandian near Wanjiafu. Currently, the area north of Nanchang and Gao'an to Tai Xin and Anyi is under Chinese control. The Chinese counter-offensive troops are advancing rapidly, and some units have reached the De'an Ruichang area, where they are engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The Chinese army obtained a large number of Japanese military documents at the front line of the Xiu River. The following is an excerpt from the translated orders of the Japanese army to slaughter civilians: "(1) Local residents are not allowed to approach the Japanese military's stationed area. Violators, regardless of gender, age, or child, will be executed without exception. (2) Food and utensils will be requisitioned locally. (3) Villages near Tan Xi must be completely burned. (4) Residents with suspicious behavior must be thoroughly slaughtered." The Japanese army's brutal behavior towards Chinese civilians is infuriating to both gods and men. (26th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese troops invading from the Xiu River are still being blocked by the Chinese army on the Anyi-Fengxin line. Some units of the Chinese army launched a counter-offensive from Jing'an yesterday morning. After eight hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army was forced to retreat towards Wanjiafu. The Japanese troops in Fengxin, whose rear lines were cut off, also fled to the northeast. In the Wuning area, both sides are still engaged in fierce fighting in the mountainous area from the northern bank of the Xiu River to Zhanggonglin Wangnaoshan. The intensity of the fighting exceeds that of the battles of Shanghai Guangjitian and Jiaozhen. Because this line is the main position for the Chinese army to defend Wuning, the Chinese army is sparing no sacrifice to defend this line. Since the 23rd of this month, the Japanese army has repeatedly charged under the cover of intense artillery fire and large formations of aircraft, but they have all been bravely repelled by the Chinese army. (26th Express News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hankou) According to sources here, the Japanese troops on the Nanchang-Xunyang Road front are still trapped between Yongxiu and Tu Jiabu. Despite their fierce offensive in recent days, they have made no progress. It is reported that the Japanese authorities in Jiujiang have expressed anxiety and disappointment. According to a statement by the Japanese military spokesperson in Wuhan last night, a portion of the Japanese army had infiltrated Leizi Gang, fifteen kilometers south of Yongxiu, and Cixi, twenty kilometers south of Yongxiu, in an attempt to disrupt the Chinese army's rear defense positions. However, according to neutral sources here, these small teams of Japanese troops that had scattered were all annihilated by the Chinese army. (26th Express News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese military personnel, the Japanese army's ambition to cut off the transportation lines between Nanchang and Xiushui Wuning has been individually defeated by the Chinese army. On the 24th of this month, the Chinese army, led by mechanized units, launched a fierce counter-offensive against the Japanese troops that had infiltrated between Anyi and Fengxin. After a bloody battle day and night, the Japanese army was forced to retreat to the Long'an Bridge Wanjiafu Qian. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than 5,000 casualties. The Chinese army is now continuing to encircle and annihilate the Japanese troops in Anyi and Wuning. Both sides are engaged in bayonet fighting in the mountainous area northwest of Chen Zhuang. Since yesterday morning, the Japanese army has repeatedly launched a fierce attack on the Chinese army's positions on the Wanshoushan Songshan line under the cover of intense artillery fire and large formations of aircraft, but has not yet succeeded. In general, although the situation in Wuning and Nanchang is very tense, it will still be quite difficult for the Japanese army to achieve its goal of occupying the above two places, and the losses it suffers will far exceed those of the Battle of Taierzhuang. (26th Express News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hankou) According to a statement by a spokesperson at the Japanese military press conference here, the Chinese army in the Wuning area is resisting very strongly. Although it has been bombed by Japanese heavy artillery and aircraft, it has not retreated slightly. Therefore, the Japanese army is still unable to approach Wuning. Currently, Wanshoushan, Shengzishan, and Songshan, two kilometers northwest of Wuning, are still under siege by the Japanese army. (26th Express News Agency Telegram)</p>

They have repeatedly tried to replenish and reorganize, but the Chinese army's continuous attacks day and night have made it impossible for the Japanese army to fight back. The Japanese army is now trapped in its strongholds and is extremely panicked. (26th Telegram)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Germany, Japan, and Qingdao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was suddenly reported that Germany and Japan were touching on the issue of Jiaozhou Bay Island. In this time of ever-changing international developments, such rumors cannot be dismissed merely because they do not conform to common sense and reason. Therefore, we would like to express our views.</p>
<p>The source of the news is London and Berlin. The reporters are Reuters of the United Kingdom, Havas of France, and Tongxun Agency of Germany. The nature of the reports is either that Japan took the initiative in this gift, or that Germany took the initiative in making this request. It is said that the Japanese intend to befriend Germany in advocating that all countries return their colonies to Germany. It is also said that the Japanese intend that Germany will hand over Jiaozhou Bay to Japan after the United Kingdom and France return Germany's former possessions. It is said that what the Germans are concerned about is that this move is not in line with the friendship between China and Germany. Others argue that the military significance of this matter is more important than the economic significance.</p>
<p>Qingdao has always belonged to Chinese territory throughout China's five thousand years of history and is purely a corner of the land where the Chinese people live. However, it is true that it has had a short period of history with both Germany and Japan. In 1897, Germany occupied Qingdao on the pretext of the murder of two German missionaries in China. In 1898, the Qing government signed a treaty with Germany to cede it; this was the beginning of Germany's occupation of Jiaozhou Bay, its management of Qingdao, and its eyeing of Shandong. Ten years later, in 1914, Japan declared war on Germany and captured it after a month-long siege; as a result, Germany's efforts in Qingdao not only went to waste, but its assets were also occupied by Japan, and its only base in the Far East was wiped out. In 1921, China and Germany resumed diplomatic relations, and Germany declared that it would abandon this right. In 1922, China recovered it. At the end of 1937, that is, four months after August 13th, China destroyed Qingdao and retreated. For more than a year until this year, it has been under the control of the Japanese army. The past is like this, and the historical facts are as solid as iron, so there is no doubt that its fundamental sovereignty belongs to China. Moreover, military occupation is only a temporary aberration and is not enough to shake sovereignty, which is a general principle of international law. Therefore, yesterday's foreign telegrams either said that Japan would return Qingdao to Germany, or that Japan would gift Qingdao to Germany. The words "return" and "gift" are all linguistic errors. If such measures are taken, then their essence is theft and private transfer of other people's property. It is a legal error and an invalid act that is not enough to confront a third country.</p>
<p>The German government recognizes this statement as slanderous, intended to stir up anti-German sentiment. Germany has not only not discussed this matter with Japan, but has not even considered it. This expression is extremely wise, and the good impression it gives to the world far exceeds the scope of the Jiaozhou Bay Island issue. Because Germany's actions on the European continent seem to be that Germany is a country that recklessly disregards everything, only seeks profit, and penetrates everywhere, the objective reaction is so serious. But for this military and economic base that once had its origins, it can be calm and tranquil, taking into account anti-German sentiment, and declaring it so solemnly. The two comparisons are of profound significance. Furthermore, what can be conclusively proven is that, despite some unfriendly actions towards China by Germany in recent years, which have gradually diminished the friendship between the two countries, the two countries are still long-standing and friendly nations with deep friendship. China, of course, does not want to immediately become hostile to Germany because of Germany's protection of Japan, and Germany will not oppress or infringe upon China because it has protected Japan to some extent. From this analysis, as long as Germany does not increase its share of Japan any further and make it difficult for China, the Sino-German relationship in the victory of the Chinese resistance will inevitably return to harmony. This is to see the subtle and know the obvious, and the clue is revealed in Germany's denial of the rumor this time.</p>
<p>However, the Qingdao issue that was reported yesterday cannot be regarded as pure fiction simply because Germany denies it. Because although Germany "has not discussed this matter and has not even considered it," this issue still has the possibility of being initiated separately. If the foreign remarks believe that "the military significance of this is more important than the economic significance," this is indeed a talk that misses the point. Because in terms of "emphasizing military strategy," Germany's revival and expansion has never been used to it so far. Is there any reason to have a far-reaching military strategy in the small island of Qingdao? Is there any reason to use troops as a doorman for Japan? Is there any reason to help Japan fight China? Is there any reason to extend national defense by dividing forces? Is there any reason to take a detour through the Far East by using Japan against Russia? Germany knows this, and Japan also knows it. Therefore, it has nothing to do with military strategy, so why emphasize military strategy? It is important to know that if the rumor of this issue is indeed based on something, then its significance is 100% in diplomacy. Only in diplomacy, so Germany's denial can be initiated by Japan's one-sided infatuation.</p>
<p>Originally, Japan's international policy after launching military aggression was extremely distressed due to external isolation and blindly struggling due to internal disagreements. Therefore, it uses small cleverness and small skills to explore for a way out everywhere, but it turns out that it encounters dead ends everywhere. For example, the so-called new order, the new regime, the declaration of allowing friendly countries to cooperate with Japan in developing China, and even this Qingdao issue are all small cleverness and small skills. And it cannot be resolved quickly, limited by its strength, and the new order of monopoly cannot be established; the puppet is only parasitic and not enough to call for, so the new regime, which is its tool, loses its original intention; the protests of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France continue, so the false cooperation cannot cover up its face, and Germany denies the rumors of the Qingdao issue, so the conspiracy is ineffective; these are all signs of dead ends. How does the Qingdao issue contain a conspiracy? To please Germany with other people's generosity and seek German assistance, such as purchasing military supplies on credit, is one. To respond to the protest about closing the door and swallowing China alone, and to show that it does not close the door and does not swallow it alone, is two. To show people the magnanimity of sharing spoils to reduce the friction caused by aggressive behavior internationally, is three. To induce aggressive partners, is four. To seek apportionment of blame for aggression, is five. To gradually expand the vortex of war, to seek survival in desperation, and to ridicule the retreat as a single defeat, is six. Only these six reasons can be the reasons for its one-sided initiation. If Germany has declared that it has never discussed this, we naturally trust this statement. This is probably because Japan is afraid that this move will not be enough to lure Germany, but it is unwilling to bury this small cleverness and small skill, so it first reveals it to the overseas press to test Germany's intentions and reserve room for advance and retreat. This kind of probing method is common in the international community.</p>
<p>Small cleverness and small skills in diplomacy initially fail to deceive international politicians, and only expose their mental labor and become increasingly clumsy. However, sometimes it also has its wonderful uses. Because intrigues and deceits sometimes know that it is a temporary deception, but they use its deception and pretend to be deaf and blind; or accept its deception and let the error continue. For example, Japan has already arranged the monopoly of foreign exchange and trade in North China, and is not worried about the entry of other countries, so it announced the opening of the outer port of Qingdao. So it deliberately implies that other places will be gradually opened. This kind of stealing the sky and changing the sun and returning the pearl for the casket's small skills can be seen through by even a three-foot-tall child. But who knows that there are no authorities of other countries who take it as an excuse to deceive their members of parliament and their industrial and commercial sectors to show their diplomatic success with Japan and to shirk their obligations to aid China? Therefore, all international phenomena, no matter how unreasonable or even contrary to common sense, if there is a one in ten, one in a hundred, one in a thousand, or one in ten thousand possibility, we cannot ignore them.</p>

<p>Guangde: About three hundred Japanese troops from Xuebu, Jintan, attacked Hua Biqiao (15 kilometers north of Liyang) in three routes on the night of the 22nd but were repelled by the Chinese army. At 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 24th, the Japanese troops attacked the area again. One route by land was crushed by the Chinese army, killing and wounding over ten Japanese soldiers. The water route [troops] are currently being encircled and annihilated by the Chinese army. (26th Day Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Shantou</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Four Japanese planes bombed Shantou at Chaoan Che, about 9:00 AM on the 26th, dropping many bombs in the prosperous areas of Yongtai and Shengping roads and the seaside, causing heavy losses. (26th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) When Japanese planes bombed Youjiang a few days ago, one of the bombers experienced mechanical failure and was forced to land. The Japanese pilot swam to the shore and was captured by the Chinese garrison. He has now been escorted to Rong and is awaiting orders. (26th Day Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Officer Returns to Country, Propagandizes Against the War</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to military sources, a Japanese officer recently returned to Japan from China and suddenly "went mad" at Yokohama train station. He stabbed one passenger to death and wounded six others in a second-class carriage. The officer has been detained and is being interrogated. However, according to reliable sources, the officer's rank is Lieutenant Colonel in the army, recently transferred from "Manchuria" back to Japan to be sent to China to fight. Unexpectedly, the officer publicly propagandized against the war upon landing at Yokohama train station, and after several passengers tried to stop him, he became enraged and started killing. To avoid shaking public morale, the military authorities are claiming that he killed because he "went mad." (26th Day Express News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Advisor to Chairman Chiang Discusses</p>
<h3>China's War Will Extend at Least Three More Years; Japan Has Made a Major Mistake, Resulting in China's Victory; Failure and Chaos Belong to Japan</h3>
<p>(London) American missionary Mr. Shepherd, who has served as an advisor to Chairman Chiang and his wife for the past five years, specializing in providing the Chairman with consultation on matters of people's welfare and construction, recently told a Reuters reporter that the war in China will last at least another three years, and China will ultimately win. There are two reasons for the recent lull in the fighting: first, the Japanese suffered heavy losses in terms of soldiers and equipment during the attack on Hankou; second, the Japanese harbored a hope that Chinese leaders would sue for peace after occupying Hankou. In reality, none of the important Chinese leaders lean towards the Japanese side. Since the beginning of the war, Japan has consistently made a major mistake, namely, failing to account for the new spirit of China. China is subjected to air raids everywhere, averaging five air raids per day, but residents have been given sufficient warning to evacuate the cities and take refuge elsewhere. These air raids have not only failed to discourage the Chinese, but have also increased their hatred of the enemy. Today, China's greatest need is medicine, and this need will be particularly urgent in the next three years. Chinese women are greatly assisting the nation, and Madame Chiang is to China today what Queen Victoria was to England in the past. (26th Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) According to yesterday's New York Times editorial, the Sino-Japanese War has evolved to the point where it is not only a victory of no benefit to Japan but also a complete failure and chaos. "Although the Japanese have been victorious militarily so far, it is really unknown what these victories are ultimately good for. On the contrary, although China has no military victories to speak of so far, its national spirit has been greatly developed and strengthened in the midst of failure, and at the same time, the stagnation and corruption in the political sphere have been greatly cleared away as a result. Although the Japanese have caused foreign trade to stagnate, with most trade being controlled by the Japanese, many of the original plans in Tokyo have been unable to be implemented. In short, this war is not only of no glory or benefit to the Japanese, but will also increasingly plunge them into poverty." (26th Day Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Chinese Government Strives to Maintain Credit; Current Measures Are Temporary; The Government Does Not Want This to Continue in the Long Term</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Finance Minister Kong officially issued a statement today, saying that the government has begun to contact the parties involved regarding debts secured by customs tax. Before the contact is completed, public bonds secured by tax should be handled in the same way as public bonds secured by customs duties, which have been implemented since January 15. (Note: On January 15 of this year, the Ministry of Finance announced that the Chinese government would not be able to fully repay maturing debts secured by customs duties from January 15 due to the arbitrary detention of customs duties by the Japanese army. However, for long-term loans, the government has designated special funds in the Central Bank for the repayment of principal and interest, and these special funds have already been allocated.) However, British and French loans will still be paid on time for the portion due on April 15, as the funds have already been allocated by the finance department to the paying agent. As for the Crisp Loan, the government has designated funds from the tax revenue to be used to pay the interest due to bondholders on March 30. The Chinese government is deeply concerned about maintaining its credit and safeguarding the interests of bondholders, despite encountering unprecedented difficulties due to the Japanese invasion. The current measures taken for various public bonds secured by tariffs are actually measures that had to be adopted due to environmental factors. The government absolutely does not want this to continue in the long term and will find a practical and appropriate method that is in line with the current long-term war of resistance and the principle of stabilizing China's financial and economic situation, in order to maintain China's credit.

<h3>Yunnan Province's Railway Line Abounds in Coal Production</h3>
<p>Kunming: In order to understand the geology and mineral resources along the entire line of the Kunming Railway, the Kunming Railway Bureau specially dispatched geologist Lin Wenying to conduct an investigation.

It is reported that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has learned of this and intends to send personnel to conduct a detailed survey for the purpose of exploitation. (26th Day Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Anqing Resumes Transshipment Mail; Japanese-Called Positions Largely Determined</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Postal Administration resumed postal service between Shanghai and Anqing, communication with various inland bureaus in Anqing has also been restored. The following is a record:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Anhui Postal Service</p>
<p>The Anqing Post Office, after withdrawing to Shanghai, has resumed operations at the beginning of the month after nearly a year. Xu Lansheng, the Director of the Anqing Postal Administration, has entered the original site of the previous Postal Administration to work. In addition to mail from Shanghai to Anqing, mail from various inland bureaus can also be transshipped through Anqing. However, the transportation of mail is handed over to Japanese ships for loading.</p>
<p>Japanese-Called Positions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration has recently employed four Japanese postal workers. One of them is to be sent to the Anqing Bureau, and the others will be sent to Nanjing, Hankou, Guangdong, and other places. However, whether further changes will be necessary in the future is not convenient to speculate before the Bureau has issued a clear order.</p>
<p>Examination Questions</p>
<p>There has been considerable criticism regarding the examination of the four Japanese employees. The Postal Bureau has always required strict examinations for the employment of employees. The examination for senior postal workers must be entrusted by the Ministry of Communications and designated by the Postal Bureau. At the same time, the practice of holding examinations for foreign postal workers in London in the past decade has long been abolished, so no one has been added.</p>
<p>A Little Clarification</p>
<p>This reason has led to criticism. However, those who understand the Bureau's environment allow it to be appropriate. To say that the four Japanese employees took the exam in Tokyo is disrespectful to the highest postal authorities, because under the current circumstances, Chinese postal workers are definitely not allowed to take exams in belligerent countries.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Attacking Muyang Suffer Losses; Chinese Army Captures Zhaoguan Dam, Killing Over One Hundred Japanese Soldiers</h3>
<p>Shuyang Communication: At dawn on the 23rd, the Japanese troops under Yanagida and Rokuno, along with 20 tanks, under the cover of five aircraft, attacked Shuyang and Donghai, attempting to cut off the Zhenghai Highway. Under the leadership of Shuyang County Chief Zhu Aizhou, the Chinese army bravely resisted, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army. As a result, the Japanese troops in southern Shandong attacked from Huandun, Heilin, and Tuohuang in three routes in order to attack Shuhai from both sides. At the same time, fierce battles also occurred in Hanjiaji, Shijiaji, Yanghe, Yanghua, Daxing, and other places. Yangzhou Communication: Ogawa, the commander of the Japanese troops in Yangzhou, and Guiban, the commander of the Japanese troops in Xiannvmiao, transferred thousands of Japanese and puppet troops to Zhaoguan Dam from Zhenjiang and other places in the past week. The Chinese Command transferred the Zhang Regiment of the provincial security forces to the west to assist the Yu Regiment of the Wang Brigade of the Chinese Army to defend it. On the morning of the 12th, seven or eight hundred Japanese and puppet troops, carrying four mortars and more than 20 light and heavy machine guns, launched a surprise attack on Zhaoguan Dam and Zhibei Ferry by land and water. The Yu and Zhang Regiments fought back separately. The Japanese advanced step by step with the most fierce artillery fire. The Chinese army fought bravely, one falling as another charged forward. After five or six hours, both sides suffered casualties. The Chinese side moved its stronghold backward for strategic reasons. The next morning, reinforcements arrived and launched a large-scale counterattack. The Japanese, with their extended battle line and limited troops, resisted stubbornly for several hours. Finally, due to the Chinese army's hundredfold courage, they were unable to withstand the attack and collapsed toward Shaobo. Zhaoguan Dam was recaptured by the Chinese army. In this battle, more than 150 Japanese soldiers were killed, six Japanese motorboats and sixteen civilian boats were destroyed, and more than 20 horses scattered.</p>

<h3>Mussolini's Speech: Willing to Maintain Long-Term Peace; Changes in Central Europe Are Inevitable; Germany and Italy are Happy to Deal with the Anti-Dictatorial Front</h3>
<p>(Rome) Today marks the 20th anniversary of the Fascist Party. Prime Minister Mussolini hosted a celebration ceremony at the stadium and delivered a speech to 60,000 veteran party members. Diplomats from various countries were invited to attend. The Prime Minister said, "Today's grand event is held at a time when the situation in Europe is tense. The principles we adhere to are very clear. In our view, professional pacifists are truly despicable. Permanent peace is enough to brew disaster, but we still believe that it is necessary to maintain a long period of peace in order to preserve European civilization and promote it. However, one thing must be stated, that is, unless the sacred rights that we should enjoy are recognized, we will not be able to achieve anything. Any attempt aimed at weakening, undermining, or destroying the Rome-Berlin axis will inevitably fail. (The audience applauded and shouted, "Long live Hitler.") It should be known that this axis is not only the foundation of friendship between Germany and Italy but also the crystallization of two revolutions. We can clearly state that the changes that have occurred in Central Europe recently are inevitable. There is a country that possesses a strong military force and many weapons and factories, but when faced with foreign invasion, it does not know how to resist. I dare to say that the time for this country to change its destiny has already matured and can only be allowed to take its course. On the other hand, if the world forms a group to oppose the dictatorial countries, the dictatorial countries will not only be happy to deal with them but will also counterattack in all aspects."</p>
<h3>Only Three Demands Made to France</h3>
<p>Last year, when I gave a speech in the port of Genoa, I said that there was an obstacle between France and Italy (referring to Spain). Today, this obstacle is about to disappear. The national army of Spain will enter the city of Madrid within a few days, or even a few hours. Once seen as the tomb of Fascism, it will soon become the tomb of Bolshevism. Everything we do does not require the world to judge it, we just want to inform the world of our views. Our government sent a note to France on December 17 last year and frankly explained the outstanding issues, which involved Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal, all of which are colonial issues. The French government has agreed to discuss these issues. It has full freedom, and we cannot intervene. Up to now, it is true that the French government has always firmly opposed it. But one thing should be noted, that is, if the gap between France and Italy continues to widen, eventually becoming difficult or even impossible to bridge, the French government should not blame others. France and Italy are both Latin nations and share blood ties, but we no longer want to hear this. Between countries, everything should be based on military strength, and the policies pursued should be shifted according to the growth and decline of military strength.</p>
<h3>The Mediterranean and Italy's Survival are Crucially Related</h3>
<p>The Mediterranean, whether geographically, historically, politically, or militarily, is a space that is crucial to Italy's survival. When we say the Mediterranean, we should include the Adriatic Sea. Although we do not need to exclude the interests that the Slavic peoples have in the Adriatic Sea, the interests that Italy has should be in a superior position. This is something that the world cannot but know.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more point, which is also the most important, and that is that we must expand our military. Our slogan is to use all methods and spare no expense to have more cannons, more warships, and more airplanes, even if it means completely abandoning the enjoyment of civilized life. All people must be strong in order to be loved by friends and feared by enemies. "The weak have no one to turn to," has always been the case, and it is still the same today. Comrades, we have worked together in the past and engaged in fierce battles, and we should do so in the future. If the interests of Italy and the interests of Fascism are harmed, we should be prepared to shed blood and defend them.</p>
<p>At this point, the Prime Minister asked the audience, "Do you want honor, rewards, and a comfortable life? Is there anything you cannot get?" The audience shouted, "We want it!" The Prime Minister then said, "Our creed has three parts: (1) faith, (2) obedience, (3) struggle. The key to all victory lies in this." Since the Party took power, the achievements that have been made are innumerable, but they have not all been completed. We are only beginning to work on social issues. Various democratic countries often say that Fascist Italy is bankrupt, has lost its strength due to the war against Abyssinia, and must borrow from the UK to survive. These slanders have now been proven to be false. In short, the achievements we have made in the past are very important in nature, but the work that should be carried out in the future is even more important. I am confident that we will be able to complete it, because my ambitions are unyielding and your spirits are also very active." (26th Day Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>French Observation: Situation Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Mussolini's speech this morning has been commented on by political figures here. They say that he did not express anything hopeless, and the difficulties encountered in the relationship between France and Italy have not been exacerbated as a result. The fact that he referred to his speech in Genoa last year shows that the various outstanding issues between France and Italy cannot be resolved before the end of the Spanish Civil War. Regarding this, France's original position has not changed. In other words, the management rights of the Suez Canal and matters related to the French Djibouti port in East Africa can be submitted for discussion, but as far as the status of Italian residents in French Tunisia is concerned, France has no reason to accept other methods other than those in accordance with the 1935 Franco-Italian agreement. In addition, Prime Minister Mussolini pointed out that the problems that Italy should solve in the Mediterranean are not limited to the outstanding issues between France and Italy, and said that Italy should be in a superior position in the Adriatic Sea. Although these words are euphemistic, they are ultimately a warning to Germany not to take any action on the Port of Trieste (which was ceded to Italy by the former Austria after the European War and is now a free port).

<h3>Britain Will Completely Innovate its Fleet Within Two Years; A Total of Twenty-Four Battleships</h3>
<p>(London) After studying the existing naval shipbuilding plan and interviewing informed sources, a Reuters naval reporter learned that Britain will have a completely new navy within two years, including nine battleships, which are the fastest battleships ever built by Britain. Among them, five are named HMS King George V, HMS Prince of Wales, HMS Duke of York, HMS Admiral Jellicoe, and HMS Admiral Beatty, each 35,000 tons, equipped with 14-inch caliber guns. Two are named HMS Lion and HMS Temeraire, each 40,000 tons, equipped with 16-inch caliber guns. The names of the remaining two are undecided, and their tonnage and gun caliber are also unknown, but it is assumed that they will be the same as the Lion. HMS King George V will be completed by the end of next year. HMS Prince of Wales will be launched on May 3 in Whitsun Bay and will also be ready for service by the end of next year. By early spring 1941, HMS Duke of York, HMS Jellicoe, and HMS Beatty (all of which began construction in the summer of 1937) will also be completed. Each of the above five larger ships can carry four aircraft and is equipped with equipment to defend against air attacks. In addition to these nine new battleships (each costing approximately 8 million pounds), the British Navy also has twelve active battleships and three battlecruisers, so Britain has a total of twenty-four battleships. Of the active battleships, five battleships and three battlecruisers belong to the Home Fleet, and a total of seven belong to the Mediterranean Fleet. Some of the active battleships have already undergone modernization and refurbishment, so they are equal to the latest type of new ships with strong combat power. (26th Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hitler's Reassertion: Willing to Support Italy</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler, in a letter to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Fascist Party, stated: "The Italian nation has striven to resist the conspiracies of those filled with malice and a lack of understanding. The German nation, sharing the same ideals as your country, is willing to be its backing." Any attempt to obstruct the legitimate development of the just aspirations of our two countries will be jointly resisted by the German nation, (Havas, 25th).</p>
<p>(Rome) An official communiqué was recently released, stating that German leader Hitler sent a telegram to Prime Minister Mussolini, delivered by Prince Regent Hess, saying that a year ago, after Germany annexed Austria, leader Hitler sent a letter to the Prime Minister through Prince Hess, explaining the reasons for the annexation and guaranteeing the inviolability of Italy's northern border, the Brenner Pass (Havas, 25th).</p>
<p>(Rome) A certain French newspaper reported that Italy's northern border, the Brenner Pass, was under threat from Germany. Prime Minister's spokesperson Gayda recently wrote in the Italian People's Voice to correct this, stating: "Since no one is threatening the Brenner Pass, Italy has no need to fortify it. Even if threatened, Italy's existing forces are sufficient to cope with it. Instead of worrying about us, the French should shift their gaze to the Rhine, where 3.5 million true Germans reside, ruled by France, but actually belonging to the German Empire. Isn't that more worrisome?" (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Political figures here recently stated that, regarding the relationship between Germany and Italy, Germany's main desire is that its expansion of power towards Eastern and Southeastern Europe should not be hindered, so as to expand its "living space." Germany, having achieved success in recent events, repeatedly speaks of the interconnected relationship between Germany and Italy. Moreover, when Germany annexed the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, Italy took a reserved attitude. Grateful for this, Germany wants to promote the Rome-Berlin Axis, plainly stating that Germany still needs to rely on Italy to make Britain and France pay attention to the Mediterranean, just as it relies on Japan to make the Soviet Union devote all its energy to watching the Far East. However, Germany is no longer willing to accept greater constraints from Italy, and it has also declined suggestions to conclude a military alliance. Furthermore, after Italy's recent activities towards Yugoslavia and Poland, Germany has felt obvious displeasure. This is also why Germany is unwilling to make further overtures to Italy. In short, what Germany is concerned about is expanding its power towards Southeastern Europe, while on the one hand making colonial demands, and on the other hand promoting the interconnected relationship between Germany and Italy, thereby diverting and restraining the attention of Britain and France, so as to do as it pleases in Southeastern Europe. That is all, (Havas, 26th).</p>
<p>(Berlin) A speech recently delivered by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has been commented on by political figures here, saying that Prime Minister Mussolini may have had a phone call with leader Hitler beforehand, and that the speech's propositions were completely endorsed by Germany. As for the relationship between France and Italy, Prime Minister Mussolini did not burn all bridges, and Germany would be very willing to hear about future re-engagements, (Agence Havas, 26th).</p>
<h3>Soviet Population: Over 170 Million</h3>
<p>(Moscow) According to the Soviet National Planning Committee, based on a nationwide survey conducted on January 17th, the total population of the Soviet Union is 170,126,000. This is a preliminary statistical figure, and the final accurate figure will be announced in mid-April, (TASS, 26th).</p>
<h3>Explanation of Italy's Three Demands</h3>
<p>(London) Italian national journalist Gayda, known as the spokesperson for Prime Minister Mussolini, recently published a lengthy article in the Star Evening News here, explaining Italy's demands on France. He said, "France has neither fulfilled the 1915 London Treaty between Britain, France, and Italy, nor has it kept the 1935 Franco-Italian agreement. According to Article 13 of the 1915 amendment, Britain and France should have given Italy a certain place as an exchange condition for Italy's assistance to the Allied nations in the war. However, France has not fulfilled this condition. Former French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval, in order to fulfill his promise, signed an agreement with the Italian authorities on January 7, 1935, attached with a secret letter, declaring that the French government was willing to relinquish its interests in Abyssinia. In other words, Italy should have France's tacit approval for any actions in Abyssinia. Subsequently, France imposed economic sanctions on Italy, destroying the political basis of the Franco-Italian cooperation agreement. Now, Italy has no other request, but hopes to wait for France to provide territorial compensation in the colonies based on treaty rights. Some may ask what new demands Italy will make on France. Regarding this, the Italian government has not yet made any decision. What the newspapers have reported in the past are merely speculations by the newspapers and reporters. It should be known that the Italian government has not yet made any decision on this matter. However, there are several obvious points that Italy should raise with France. Among them, there are three important items: (1) The Tunisia issue: The number of Italian residents in that place actually exceeds that of the French. It is only because hundreds of thousands of Italian residents have acquired French nationality that French official statistics do not distinguish them, so outsiders do not understand and believe that there are more French than Italians. In addition, incidents of abuse of Italian residents are also frequently seen. It should be known that the reason why Italy recognized France's exercise of protectorate in Tunisia in the past was on the condition that the French government guarantee the national rights of Italian residents. Now, there are obvious circumstances that violate this condition, and it must be stopped. (2) The Suez Canal issue: What Italy demands is that the management methods of the Suez Canal must be revised to adapt to the new era and the new needs of various countries. (3) The French Djibouti Port issue in East Africa: The hinterland of that port has common interests with the Italian Empire, and France should cooperate with Italy. However, it does not do so, allowing the last batch of Abyssinian rebels to gather in the port and protecting them, and levying huge freight fees on Italian goods passing through the port and from the port via the Addis Ababa railway line, which is very wrong. If all these issues are not resolved, there will never be a day for reconciliation between France and Italy. On the Italian side, there has long been a determination to clarify the current situation. However, the French authorities stubbornly adhere to their opinions and cannot devise a good solution. If the current situation can be quickly and safely clarified in this way, it will be extremely difficult," (Havas, 26th).</p>
<h3>Roman Observation: Situation Eases</h3>
<p>(Rome) Political figures here recently stated that Prime Minister Mussolini's speech today may ease the situation in the Mediterranean. Even if this prospect is very weak, it should not be ignored. A close examination of the Prime Minister's speech reveals that the section on Franco-Italian relations is the most important, as it has clearly indicated that the Spanish issue will no longer become an obstacle to bilateral relations. The only thing that remains to be resolved is the colonial issue, but the Prime Minister only spoke of it as a "problem" and did not use the word "demand." As for the so-called colonial issue, although the Prime Minister did not specifically explain it, according to well-informed sources, Italy's minimum "desires" are no more than the following: (1) The de jure status of Italian residents in French Tunisia in North Africa should be revised. (2) France should cede the railway from Djibouti Port to Addis Ababa to Italy. (3) A portion of French Djibouti Port should be designated as a free port for Italy's use. (4) Reduce Suez Canal transit fees. (5) Allow Italy to participate in the management rights of the Suez Canal. It seems that these so-called "natural desires of Italy" are now officially targeting Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal. Diplomatic figures say that observing the speeches made successively by King Emmanuel III and Prime Minister Mussolini, it is known that Italy is now waiting for France to take the first step in order to reopen negotiations. As for the reason why the Prime Minister mentioned the Adriatic Sea in his speech, it was probably to indicate that no third country is allowed to interfere in the Adriatic coast, (Havas, 26th).</p>
<h3>German-Dutch Trade Agreement: Already Signed</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Economic negotiations conducted by representatives of the German government and the Dutch government have been completed, and an economic agreement was signed today, increasing the volume of bilateral trade, (Havas, 25th).</p>
<p>(Berlin) The current trade agreement between Germany and the Netherlands will expire on the 31st of this month. The two sides have recently renewed the agreement, expanding the scope of the current agreement. The content has not yet been made public. It is reported that trade between Germany and the Netherlands declined significantly in 1938. German exports to the Netherlands decreased by 18%, and imports from the Netherlands also decreased by 12%. It is said that the current trade agreement lists 120 kinds of German goods and stipulates import quotas, but in reality, only ten have reached the quota over the years, (Agence Havas, 26th).</p>
<h3>Setback in Spanish Peace Talks: Conditions Difficult to Fulfill</h3>
<p>Burgos: Last night, it was believed here that it would not be easy to occupy Madrid without bloodshed. Therefore, the atmosphere of peaceful resolution is not as strong as it was a few hours ago, because a certain negotiating representative of the government army said that General Miaja and Colonel Casado felt that the agreed-upon surrender conditions were difficult to implement. People on the government side stated that if the Republican army cannot fulfill the conditions of surrender, the National Army will engage in siege warfare, and it is expected that the Republican army will not be able to resist for long, (Haitong, 26th).</p>
<p>Lisbon: According to a radio broadcast report from Madrid last night, the government army will continue to hold peace talks with General Franco, and will never make a shameful surrender. The news circulating outside that representatives of the Madrid Defense Council have gone to Burgos for negotiations is not accurate. According to the information revealed in the report, the peace talks between Madrid and Burgos are exchanging opinions in code on the radio, (Associated Press, 26th).</p>
<p>Burgos: It is said that Madrid sent representatives again yesterday to consult with General Franco on the final peace conditions. It is heard that the content is about the surrender of the government army's air force. It is learned that the government army's aircraft are now being transferred, (Haitong, 26th).</p>
<p>(Rome) According to a telegram from Madrid yesterday afternoon, the government army's aircraft, including 30 fighter jets and 15 bombers, have been handed over to the National Army. It is heard that after this matter is completed, the National Army will enter the city of Madrid. It is estimated that the vanguard of the National Army can enter the city this morning, and its main force will continue to arrive, (Haitong, 26th).</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian Daily reports that, according to news from Madrid, the Republican government authorities have now "completely succumbed" according to the conditions proposed by the National Army government. The first step is to hand over all military aircraft in the city, including 30 fighter jets and 15 bombers, to the National Army authorities. According to a certain other newspaper, representatives sent by the Republican government arrived in the city of Burgos on the 23rd of this month and proposed peace conditions, but General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the National Army, refused to consider them and only demanded that the Republican government authorities surrender within 48 hours, (Havas, 25th).</p>
<p>Burgos: Eleven warships belonging to the Republican government fled from the southern port of Cartagena to the French port of Bizerte in North Africa, and were detained by the French authorities. According to official news here, the French government has decided to hand them over to the National Army government. It is reported that the Republican government's destroyer "José Luis Díaz," after being detained in the British port of Gibraltar, was handed over to the National Army government by the British authorities yesterday, (Havas, 25th).</p>
<p>(Paris) The first ambassador to France from the Spanish National Army government, Lequerica, arrived here in the afternoon today and immediately made a statement to the press, saying, "I am very happy to be ordered to come to France and do my best for the work of pacification. I hope that the agreement signed between the French representative Pétain in the city of Burgos and our government will be implemented quickly, so that bilateral relations can become closer in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding," (Havas, 25th).</p>
<p>(London) According to today's London Times, representatives of the Spanish National Army government will sign a concordat in the near future. It also reports that General Franco intends to reciprocate with visits to Rome to meet with Mussolini and General Göring, (Haitong, 26th).</p>

<h3>Failure of European Collective Security Plan: Disappointment Among Majority of US Legislators</h3>
<p>British Newspapers Also Express Discontent</p>
<p>Massive Anti-German Demonstration in New York with 100,000 Participants</p>
<p>The diplomatic correspondent of the London Observer claims that the anti-aggression declaration of the four powers – Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland – has now been abandoned. The Polish government has shown no interest in participating in this demonstration, believing that its only practical purpose is to create the possibility of international consultation if Poland is subjected to German aggression. On the other hand, the Soviet Union's proposal to provide substantial military assistance, agreeing to take immediate action in the event of German aggression or the threat of aggression, is also not valued by Warsaw, as the Poles still adhere to their long-standing principle of maintaining complete neutrality in the disputes between Germany and the Soviet Union. In the current situation, the Polish opinion is that they do not welcome Soviet troops entering their territory, regardless of their purpose, and they do not attempt to conceal this. The French government is not particularly regretting the failure of the four-power declaration plan, and believes that the obligations borne by the British and French governments will be limited to dealing with German aggression in Western Europe. Although the Soviet government did not include the Far East in the scope of negotiations, it insists that only complete restraint by Britain and the Soviet Union, taking military action against Germany, can curb its aggression. This restraint should be equally applied to German aggression in both East and West. The Soviet Union's intention is that Britain and the Soviet Union should have military restraint in both Eastern and Western Europe. The minimum requirement on the British side should be to immediately declare war on Germany and immediately send a fleet to blockade Germany, (Reuters, 26th).</p>
<p>(London) This Sunday, British newspapers discussed the events of the past week, frankly admitting the failure of Britain's planned policy of resisting aggression. At the same time, they also criticized Britain's attempt to join hands with the Soviet Union to jointly oppose it, and Britain's failure to persuade Poland to unreservedly support Britain. The Observer commented that the four-power declaration proposal has clearly become a pie in the sky. Even the London Times implies a warning, saying that Britain's plan to hope for complete support from the Soviet Union, Poland, and Romania may not be as desired, (Haitong, 26th).</p>
<p>(Washington) US political figures recently stated that the attempt by European countries threatened by German imperialism to form a united front has failed. As a result, US congressmen who support the government's current policy are also disappointed. The purpose of President Roosevelt's policy is to adjust all the forces of the world's anti-totalitarianists, so as to restore the principle of collective security. In his view, the only effective way to establish lasting peace is to establish a collective security organization. Although many in Congress have expressed support for this proposition, if people's efforts in this regard are frustrated, the psychology of Congressmen will inevitably be affected. Judging from the fact that the majority of non-isolationist senators clearly stated yesterday that it is inappropriate to amend the Neutrality Act at this time, it can be seen that these senators hold no more than three arguments: (1) The United States has condemned Germany's actions in the Czech Republic and imposed additional taxes on the country's imported goods to show "punishment." It has already done its part. If European countries directly threatened by Germany cannot further cooperate, then the United States has no reason to take a more serious stance. (2) President Roosevelt knows that totalitarianism is enough to threaten the principles of democracy, so he is unwilling to make any concessions to totalitarian countries. However, British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons the other day stated that ideological differences are not enough to hinder peace. This view is completely contrary to President Roosevelt's original position. (3) If the current Neutrality Act is amended at this time, general public opinion will believe that the United States is accepting new constraints to support Britain and France. On the contrary, Britain and France have failed to unite the related countries to resist Germany, and US public opinion is already somewhat disgusted. The Chicago Daily News recently stated that the recent events are the natural result of the Munich Agreement. "If the world wants to stop Germany from advancing, it should have done so before the Munich Agreement." Other newspapers said that after Germany annexed the Czech Republic and recovered the Memel region, its power has greatly increased, and the threatened countries still cannot find a constructive way to restore order and curb the advancement of the aggressor countries. In this situation, the US Congress and general public opinion believe that the attitude adopted by the government in the future should be to observe the situation quietly. If there are new actions, it is already felt that it is not very appropriate and useless, (Havas, 25th).</p>
<p>(New York) Republican Senator Borah recently made a speech attacking Britain, with very harsh words, saying that Germany's annexation of Austria and the split of the Czech Republic were actually encouraged by Britain. Britain can be called Hitler's ally. "In short, the democratic countries of Europe only want to pursue imperialism and destroy national socialism. The United States should not help them. When war breaks out in Europe in the future, I will neither agree to supply any participating country with cash or military supplies, nor do I want to see Americans sacrifice for the conspiracies of European imperialism," Senator Borah said. It is reported that some aspects of the US political circle are quite distressed because the democratic countries of Europe have failed to form a group to deal with national socialist Germany effectively. This can be seen from the remarks of Borah and certain members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, (Havas, 26th).</p>
<p>(New York) An anti-German demonstration was held here this afternoon, with no less than 100,000 participants. Among them, there were many overseas Chinese from Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, and Poland, all wearing their national costumes, which was quite eye-catching. The demonstrators held banners with various anti-German and anti-fascist slogans, and shouted, "European countries should resist German aggression." Although the number of participants was large, the order was well-maintained. When they arrived at Columbus Circle, Mayor LaGuardia gave a speech to them, fiercely criticizing Germany. At that time, former Czech President Beneš and former ambassador to Britain Masaryk were both silently sitting on the podium. LaGuardia's words said that Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic was an international atrocity. A certain country is acting recklessly, arbitrarily destroying the independence of other countries, infringing on the borders of other countries, and occupying the cities of other countries. The world will have no peace and happiness. I now express my deep sympathy to the Czech nation in the name of the citizens of New York, (Havas, 25th).</p>
<p>San Francisco: Many people recently held a demonstration near the German consulate, protesting against Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic. They also sent four representatives to the German consulate to deliver a letter of protest. Consul General Wiedemann immediately met them, but refused to accept the letter of protest and declared to the representatives, "The consulate has no right to interfere in political events. If the representatives have any opinions, they should submit them to the German Embassy in Washington." The representatives had no choice but to retreat without success, (Havas, 25th).</p>
<h3>US Legislative Amendment Issue</h3>
<p>Attacks by Thomas</p>
<p>Proposal by Pittman</p>
<p>(Washington) Democratic Congressman Thomas criticized the new Neutrality Act amendment proposed by Pittman last night, regarding the "cash and carry" clause as unethical because this clause is obviously unfavorable to the invaded country. Thomas stated in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Pittman's proposal would favor the aggressor countries, because when comparing the aggressor countries with the invaded countries, the aggressor countries often have larger wallets than the invaded countries. In addition, it will give the world a bad impression, regarding the United States as a purely cash-and-carry shop, believing that the United States' policy is completely based on commercialism and is no different from the gold-dollar diplomacy of the 19th century, and repeating the mistake of the neutral commercial rights that were involved in the European war. According to Thomas, the United States' hope for peace cannot be limited to the unity of the Western Hemisphere, and at the same time, its neutrality law must be "ethical, fair, selfless, and worthy of conscience," (Associated Press, 26th).</p>
<p>(New York) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to discuss the issue of amending the current Neutrality Act on the 29th of this month. According to the New York Times, the members of the committee have conflicting opinions and can be divided into six factions: 1. Supporters of the Pittman bill, advocating allowing belligerent countries to purchase military equipment and various raw materials from the United States, but they must purchase with cash and transport them on their own. 2. Those who advocate authorizing the president to prohibit aggressor countries from purchasing military equipment and raw materials in the United States. 3. Those who advocate directly abolishing the current Neutrality Act. 4. Those who advocate deleting the provision in the current Neutrality Act that prohibits the export of military supplies. 5. Those who oppose the Pittman bill. 6. Those who intend to consider the situation and decide their attitude when the discussion begins, (Havas, 26th).</p>
<h3>Armistice Reached Between Hungarian and Slovakian Armies</h3>
<p>Joint Committee Formed</p>
<p>To Handle Border Disputes</p>
<p>Mr. Plessinger, Commander of the Slovakian National Army, recently stated in an interview with a Havas News Agency reporter that his country and the Hungarian National Army have agreed on an armistice. However, the Hungarian army is still constructing defensive fortifications in the occupied areas and expelling residents. (Havas News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Hungarian City: Regarding the border dispute between Hungary and Slovakia, the Hungarian government requested that Slovakia send representatives for negotiations. The Slovakian authorities recently responded, agreeing and expressing their willingness to demarcate the border according to the division between Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia in the former Czechoslovak Republic. It is understood that both sides will begin negotiations here on the 27th of this month. The Hungarian government will then declare that it intends to base its claims on various principles, insisting that certain areas of Slovakia inhabited by Hungarians should belong to Hungary and be temporarily occupied by the Hungarian army. (Havas News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Prague: The Hungarian-Slovakian Joint Committee is scheduled to meet on March 27th to address the armed conflict situation. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin: News of contact between Hungarian and Slovakian troops has been banned from publication by local authorities. So far, official circles seem to support Hungary's expansion. It is argued that the border between Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia in the former Czechoslovakia was merely an administrative division and not based on ethnic principles. Therefore, Hungary's actions cannot be considered an invasion of the Slovakian border. However, as Slovakia is under German protection, Germany does not want to disappoint it. This is why Germany is maintaining silence. (Havas News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Foreign Minister Ciano received British Chargé d'Affaires Sir Noel Charles this afternoon. According to reliable sources, Charles told Ciano that the British government is concerned about the situation in Hungary and Slovakia, as well as Romania. Ciano replied that the Italian government believes there is no need for concern. In addition, Charles explained the British government's response to Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. Ciano then met with Hungarian Ambassador Mr. Rolanyi to discuss the current situation in Hungary and Slovakia, as well as Romania. (Havas News Agency, 25th)</p>
<h3>Provincial Government Actively Planning to Improve Fujian's Specialty Products</h3>
<p>Mechanized Tea Production Already Showing Success</p>
<p>Sugar Industry Undergoing Concrete Improvements</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Fujian Province's main agricultural exports include tea, tobacco, sugarcane, and fruits. Tea exports in the past amounted to tens of millions of yuan annually. At its peak, Yongding shredded tobacco alone had an annual output of three to four million yuan. Sugarcane, as the raw material for sugar production, had annual domestic sales of over two million dan (a unit of weight) before the import of foreign sugar. Fruits such as tangerines, pomelos, lychees, longans, olives, and flowers like daffodils and gladioli were regularly shipped to other regions, often reaching several million yuan annually. Later, due to competition from foreign goods and substitutions, exports declined. In recent years, the Fujian provincial authorities have been actively promoting production and making every effort to improve these agricultural exports in order to restore their former glory. The progress of each improvement is described below: Improvement of Tea: A. Tea: To revitalize the tea industry, the Fujian provincial government, in addition to establishing tea warehouses to manage transportation and sales, and conducting tea inspections, specifically established the Tea Improvement Farm in Fuan in 1935. The farm includes a tea plantation, divided into flatland and mountainous areas. The flatland area of thirty-six mu (a unit of area) serves as a various experimental zone, conducting various cultivation experiments on tea trees. The mountainous area of over two hundred mu is used for ordinary tea cultivation. In addition, there is an attached tea processing factory equipped with modern machinery, including engines, rolling machines, lump-breaking machines, screening machines, and drying machines. Tea production began in 1937, marking the first mechanized tea production in Fujian Province. In that year, eighty-one boxes were produced, with the highest price reaching seventy-five taels (a unit of weight) per hundred jin (another unit of weight), exceeding the general tea price in Fuan by twenty taels. In 1938, the original plan was to produce eighty boxes, but due to various reasons, only twenty-eight boxes were produced. However, the quality, such as the strip shape and aroma, was more advanced than before. The Provincial Tea Management Office shipped them to Hong Kong, where they fetched a price of one hundred and thirty Hong Kong dollars per hundred market catties (a unit of weight), breaking the highest price record for tea in Fuan and Shouning counties. Tea processing improvement can be said to have achieved initial success. As for the promotion of tea technology, the Tea Improvement Farm has demonstration tea gardens and specially contracted tea gardens for tea farmers to observe and learn from. Staff are also sent to tea estates near the tea farm to guide tea processing and box packaging improvement methods, with the aim of promoting improvement work.</p>
<p>Planning to Establish a Tobacco Factory: B. Tobacco: Regarding the improvement of tobacco, the Fujian provincial government originally planned to establish a tobacco experiment station in Yongding, but it did not materialize. In the autumn of 1938, the Agricultural Improvement Bureau specifically purchased a large batch of tobacco seeds from Sichuan, totaling more than two hundred varieties, some of which were American varieties suitable for manufacturing cigarettes. They were trial-planted in Liancheng, Yongding, and other places. In Liancheng, the Agricultural Improvement Bureau conducted the trial planting itself. In Yongding, the bureau jointly established a farm with the county government and specially contracted farmers for trial planting. In other places, the planting was handed over to the Provincial Cooperative Affairs Management Office, which distributed the seeds to rural cooperatives in fragrant areas for trial planting and experimentation. If the results are excellent, the government will establish a cigarette factory to produce its own cigarettes, then it will not be difficult to plug the leakage of several million yuan per year, and Fujian's tobacco industry can also restore its former prosperity!</p>
<p>Sugar Industry: C. Sugarcane: Sugarcane in Fujian Province is mostly produced in southern Fujian, where the land is fertile and the climate is mild, and is used as a raw material for sugar production. In recent years, due to China's increase in foreign sugar tariffs, the sales of Fujian sugar have recovered, and the number of people engaged in sugarcane cultivation has gradually increased. Excellent varieties and new machinery have also been imported from foreign countries, resulting in a significant increase in production. Taking Putian and Xianyou counties as examples, the sugar produced in 1936 was statistically worth more than five million yuan. Later, the Japanese broke through our customs barriers through smuggling, and after the start of the war, the port was blockaded by the Japanese, resulting in poor sales and difficulties in the lives of sugarcane farmers. The sugar industry in Fujian Province is unlikely to revive during the war. However, the promotion and encouragement of the sugarcane sugar industry by the Fujian provincial authorities in recent years are worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Selecting Sugarcane Varieties: The original bamboo sugarcane in Fujian Province has stems as thin as bamboo. Although its drought resistance is strong, the yield of sugarcane stems is too small, and the sugar content is not high. The Fujian provincial government believes that if sugar industry is to be developed, sugarcane varieties must be improved first. In the spring of 1935, loans were provided to sugarcane farmers in Xianyou County who were planting Taiwanese sugarcane varieties. At the same time, staff were sent to various counties in southern Fujian to investigate sugarcane varieties and cultivation conditions. It was believed that the Javanese large-stem sugarcane varieties imported by the people in recent years were of excellent quality and suitable for cultivation in Fujian Province. However, the quantity was too small to be popularized, so the Zhangpu Bangxiang Farm was entrusted to specifically cultivate five million Javanese sugarcane seedlings, which were promoted to various counties in southern Fujian at no cost or low cost in the spring of 1936. At that time, due to inconvenient transportation, only over one million three hundred thousand plants were trial-planted in nine counties including Longxi. Farmers were provided with loans of ten yuan per mu by the government for sugarcane seeds and fertilizer expenses when cultivating Javanese sugarcane seedlings. Although it could not be fully popularized for a while, farmers welcomed the Javanese sugarcane varieties. After repeated propagation, the number of excellent Javanese sugarcane varieties in southern Fujian has greatly increased compared to before. Regarding the sugarcane trial planting project, the Fujian provincial government has established the Zhangpu Farm, newly opening up over four hundred mu of land for sugarcane trial planting and improvement. After testing, it was believed that Javanese sugarcane varieties were far superior to local sugarcane varieties. The sugarcane planting season should be changed from spring planting to autumn planting. In addition, sugarcane fertilizer experiments and drought-resistant cultivation experiments were conducted, and the results were very satisfactory.</p>
<p>Providing Loans and Assistance: In addition to improving sugarcane, the Fujian provincial government is planning to establish large-scale factories on one hand and is making every effort to support the development of private sugarcane sugar enterprises on the other. For example, the Zhangpu Fengxiang Farm was specifically reorganized by the Construction Department from 1937, with an investment of thirty thousand yuan, and was transformed into a joint public-private venture to serve as a demonstration of small-scale mechanized sugar production in rural southern Fujian. In addition, the Zainei Farm in Longxi, the Dahe Farm in Yongchun, the Wenling Sugarcane Company in Nan'an, and the Jiaosaka Farm in Tongan have all received funds from the provincial government to provide assistance and loans for their development.</p>

<h3>Germany Declares No Intention to Invade Poland</h3>
<p>(Berlin) An article authorized by the German government's foreign intelligence agency stated that Germany has absolutely no intention of invading Poland. Germany recognizes the existence of a strong Poland as a political necessity and an indispensable factor in maintaining order in Eastern Europe. Now that Poland and Hungary have established a common border, various rumors about Germany's plan to expand eastward will be dispelled without argument. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The Polish-Military Relations Newspaper today published an editorial stating that no matter how strong the enemy is, we are prepared to fight them. Poles are not weak and are not intimidated by the enemy's superior forces and equipment, nor are they intimidated by the enemy's exaggerated rhetoric. Poland's own large number of soldiers, high morale, sophisticated equipment, and the courage and unyielding spirit of the people are sufficient to win. We firmly believe that our bayonets will defeat the enemy. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>British-Russian Talks Approaching; Russia Does Not Request British Assistance in the Far East; Japanese Concern Over Vladivostok Fleet Strength</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese side is greatly concerned about the potential strength of the Soviet Navy in Vladivostok. According to recent Japanese sources, Vladivostok has seven refurbished cruisers (two of 5,000 to 6,000 tons and four of 3,000 to 4,000 tons), seven destroyers, eighty submarines, one hundred and forty high-speed motor vessels, totaling two hundred and forty-one vessels, six hundred aircraft, and two thousand pilots. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The Observer stated that rumors that the Soviet Union would propose to Britain that Britain must support the Soviet Union in the Far East to contain Japan as an exchange condition for Soviet assistance to Britain in Europe are completely unfounded. The Soviet Union has never included this condition in its communications to Britain and France. The Soviet Union has also stated that it is capable of handling Japan on its own. (Reuters, 25th)</p>

<h3>What Kind of Love Can Be Considered Understanding the True Meaning of Love?</h3>
<p>In society, unsatisfactory marital matches often lead to endless suffering. This is truly caused by incorrect and flawed marital concepts. Therefore, you must recognize that the fundamental concept of marriage is that a man and a woman obtain a lifelong and closest relationship with each other as "themselves," not that "parents" are "choosing a son-in-law" or "taking a daughter-in-law." Therefore, marriage can never be decided by parents. So young people should choose good spouses and good husbands for themselves.</p>
<p>Although young people should choose their own spouses, how should they go about getting good spouses? This requires a process, and this process is "love"! Homa Hisao said: "Marriage is based on love; if there is no love, no matter what conditions are met, marriage becomes an inherited and commercial transaction." Ellen Key also said: "No matter what kind of marriage, if there is love, it is moral; even if it has gone through legal procedures, if there is no love, it is immoral." So we know that love is the first requirement, the core and element of marriage; only a marriage that is based on genuine love between both parties is reasonable.</p>
<p>Here, you must first understand the true meaning of love! Love is a special affection between opposite sexes that originates from health. However, you cannot think of it as a simple reproductive impulse; reproductive activity that reaches a healthy state can establish love!</p>
<p>Many young people do not have the true meaning of love and often disregard the health of their reproductive functions, so they will have marital discord after marriage.</p>
<p>Speaking of the reasons for reproductive dysfunction, premarital masturbation and debauchery, and excessive indulgence after marriage are the most common. Therefore, the development of physical and mental abilities is hindered, which promotes spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, vaginal discharge, neurasthenia, infertility after marriage, and premature aging, which is a major reason. Since reproductive power is decadent and weak, the love between husband and wife only extends to the surface. In short, it lacks sexual love.</p>
<p>Those who are now suffering from the above-mentioned diseases, why not seek medical treatment early, so as not to damage love for a long time? According to my years of treatment experience, the German testicular essence preparation "Bu Ti Kang" for men is the most effective remedy! Since its introduction, it has been unanimously praised by world-renowned doctors. I often try it on patients with brain weakness, kidney deficiency, and premature ejaculation, and it is always effective. The female "Bu Ti Kang" is especially a sacred medicine for regulating menstruation and promoting conception!</p>
<h3>Causes of Spermatorrhea and Seminal Emission Caused by Masturbation</h3>
<p>— Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Why does masturbation cause spermatorrhea and seminal emission? The reason is very clear. Masturbation can make the erection nerves and ejaculation center oversensitive, so unconscious emission of semen will occur during deep sleep and unconsciously. The number of times gradually increases, causing sperm and blood to deplete, so the opportunity for metabolism gradually slows down. As a result, the brain nerves, sexual nerves, and spinal cord are greatly damaged, leading to all kinds of weakness symptoms!</p>
<p>Due to the habit of masturbation, even if spermatorrhea has broken out, if one can recognize the harm and quit it as soon as possible, all harms can be avoided. However, there are many popular treatments now, such as using cold water to rub the local area before going to bed, electrical therapy, prostate massage, and internal medicine, etc. Based on my experience of more than ten years of clinical practice, I deeply understand that there is no careful health regimen, and taking "Nai Er Si Spermatorrhea Tablets" before going to bed is more effective. Other methods can only be used as aids. The effect of cold water massage and electrotherapy does not go beyond the scope of massage, while the "Nai Er Si Spermatorrhea Tablets" have the power to reach the sperm barrier and also have the effect of calming the brain nerves. If you have suffered from frequent spermatorrhea and do not have neurasthenia and other symptoms, taking "Bu Ti Kang" at the same time is very effective.</p>

<h3>What is: Gonorrhea's Deadly Enemy?</h3>
<p>— Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>What is gonorrhea's deadly enemy? This sentence seems abrupt on the surface. But in fact, this disease of gonorrhea really makes people have a headache, but I don't know that this kind of gonorrhea, which is unrestrained and unscrupulous, has indeed reached its end. Because gonorrhea is the most difficult venereal disease to treat, it has strong resistance and cunning escape methods. Once infected with gonorrhea, if it is not completely cured, it will never be cured. Therefore, there is the slogan that there is no cure for gonorrhea.</p>
<p>However, science is progressing, and medicine is also advancing rapidly. This gonorrhea, which was once regarded as incurable, now has the invention of a special drug for gonorrhea, "Ke Lin Nong." This drug is made of a special protein color mixture using scientific methods, so it has absolutely no crude and impure ingredients, and has no adverse side effects. Therefore, it has special effects when used for general gonorrhea symptoms. Please read the following points, and you can understand:</p>
<p>First: The bactericidal effect of "Ke Lin Nong" is extremely rapid. After taking this drug in a short period of time, an anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect occurs. This effect can directly reach the lesion and surround and annihilate all gonococci. Wherever gonococci are located, the bactericidal effect of "Ke Lin Nong" will track and reach them. Therefore, once "Ke Lin Nong" is taken, gonorrhea will be cured. Regardless of prostatitis, orchitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, arthritis, etc. in acute and chronic gonorrhea, and women's gonorrheal leucorrhea, vaginitis, cervicitis, ovaritis, etc., can all be cured by taking "Ke Lin Nong." However, men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally, and women can use "Ka Er Xue Di Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories. They can all use self-treatment at home according to the diagrams and instructions, which is especially simple and practical. Having said this, "Ke Lin Nong" is the deadly enemy of conquering all stages of gonorrhea. Therefore, it can be popular all over the world, and experts unanimously praise its use. Without actual results, how could there be such achievements!</p>
<h3>The Future of Cough</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Coughing seems to be an experience that everyone has, but many causes of cough are not easy to cure. Coughing incessantly, or dry cough without phlegm, or coughing up phlegm unsatisfactorily, or coughing up a lot of phlegm like fluff, or coughing up blood in the phlegm, in short, if the cough is not cured, the future is very dangerous. Nineteen out of ten Chinese people have latent lung disease. Usually, because the resistance is strong, it surrounds the tuberculosis bacteria on all sides, but the resistance often disappears due to coughing. This tuberculosis bacteria breaks through and comes out, like a tiger out of its cage. It acts recklessly, so after coughing, it is followed by tuberculosis, which is especially common. In order to prevent cough from worsening and overtaking the situation, it is necessary to quickly cure the cough. "Bu Fei Na Er" is the only special medicine for relieving cough and eliminating phlegm. Regardless of the first, second, or third stage of lung disease, it is always effective and has long been praised by Chinese and foreign lung disease experts.</p>
<p>New Words on Gonorrhea</p>
<p>— Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<h3>Gonorrheal Cystitis Can Cause Death</h3>
<p>It is not uncommon for us to see clinically patients die from gonorrhea. Gonorrheal cystitis, which is often overlooked by the general public, also poses a dangerous risk of causing critical conditions. Originally, gonorrheal cystitis is caused by gonococci invading the bladder. Because the bladder is the storage place for urine, its symptoms are frequent urination, often thirty or forty times a day. Often, after only a few minutes, one wants to urinate again. Especially at night, it is even more frequent, leading to insomnia and neurasthenia. In addition, after urination, pain occurs from the lower abdomen to the urethra. The urine discharged is very thin, far less thick than when healthy. Severely, this kind of pain is too much. Therefore, urination is more difficult. Also, according to our daily practical experience, because there is pus in the urine, it appears turbid milky white, and sometimes blood urine is discharged. What is even more terrifying is that once it becomes chronic and urination is not smooth, the amount of residual urine accumulated in the bladder increases day by day, causing it to be too full. If not rescued urgently, death will result from uremia.</p>
<p>The treatment of this disease must not be done with slow and inappropriate methods, because this kind of treatment is of no help to this kind of cystitis, which is as urgent as a shooting star. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly perform a surgical operation to remove the residual urine in order to alleviate the condition. Otherwise, complications will inevitably arise, making treatment even more hesitant. In recent years, for patients with gonorrheal cystitis who have become uremic, I have used surgical removal. For general gonorrheal cystitis, warm compress therapy is performed on the lower abdomen, as well as German electrostatic therapy. At the same time, the gonorrhea holy medicine "Ke Lin Nong" is taken internally, so that it can directly produce bactericidal, anti-gonorrheal, anti-inflammatory, and diuretic effects on the lesions. Then, the attached bacteria attached to the bladder and other parts will be eliminated and cleared in one fell swoop, and it will be difficult to leak out.

<h3>British Far East Fleet Commander, Nobel, Visits Siam and Expresses Optimism About China's Prospects in the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>Bangkok Correspondence: The Siamese government recently promulgated a new regulation requiring Chinese immigrants to pay a residence tax of 200 baht per person (approximately equivalent to 600 yuan in national currency). It also increased import duties on Chinese goods by one-fifth compared to last year and frequently engaged in actions that suppressed the patriotic movements of overseas Chinese. Vice Admiral Nobel, commander of the British Far East Fleet, visited the Philippines and its coastal defenses this spring. On March 1st, he visited Macau and on the 4th, in Hong Kong, he consulted with Tanaka, a staff officer of the Japanese army in Guangzhou, regarding the Luohu bombing incident. On the 6th, he flew to the flagship Kent, the flagship of Flower Moff, to</p>
<p>Singapore for a Review</p>
<p>Passing through the Gulf of Siam, he arrived in Bangkok on the 10th. The British Minister to Siam arranged a welcoming ceremony. At 5:30 AM on the 10th, the Siamese Minister of Defense, Minister of the Navy, and others sent representatives, along with personnel from the British Legation, to welcome him at Paknam. The flagship Kent had too deep a draft to navigate upstream on the Chao Phraya River, so he transferred to the Siamese shallow-draft warship Pra Rong to reach Bangkok. The Flower Moff docked at the British oil company wharf. The British commander first laid a wreath at the monument to the fallen soldiers of the European War and then visited the Regency Council, the State Council, the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and others. In the afternoon at 4 PM, Siamese military and political figures paid a return visit to the Flower Moff. The Minister of Defense hosted a banquet that evening, lasting for four days.</p>
<p>The Entertainment Was Extremely Cordial, the Significance Great, and Unprecedented. It was not until the afternoon of the 14th that the British commander boarded his ship and departed Siam for Singapore to participate in the Singapore defense exercises on the 16th to test whether Far Eastern defenses were secure. A reporter boarded the Flower Moff to interview him. The Siamese Minister of Defense happened to be present, and as both men were about to disembark to sightsee, they could not speak freely. According to the British commander, his impressions from visiting various places were that peace in the Far East had better prospects for development and was entering a better phase. Regarding</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese War, he did not want to express any opinion but only said that China's prospects in the war of resistance had entered a favorable stage. His demeanor was serious and his tone was assertive and forceful when he spoke. We can anticipate that this trip by the British commander will have good results. Furthermore, two US Class A cruisers of over 10,000 tons, the "Augusta" and the "Marblehead," followed the British commander in visiting Siam. These ships came from the Philippines and stopped at Singapore to observe the exercises. Recently, within a month, the navies of France, Britain, and the United States have all visited Siam. The safety of the Nanyang region and Siam's future direction are indeed worthy of the world's attention.</p>
<h3>Gulangyu's Terror Deepens</h3>
<p>Gulangyu Correspondence: After the fall of Xiamen, Gulangyu, just a short distance away, has become a dark and terrifying world under the threat of the Japanese army. Recently, the Japanese consulate in Gulangyu has been exerting its power wantonly, dispatching large numbers of combat troops, fully armed, acting as if facing a major enemy, rushing around everywhere searching for young people. As a result, Li Jiaji, a member of the Gulangyu Board of Trustees, and Reverend Ying, the head of the International Relief Food Division, were arrested one after the other. Such brutal acts are too numerous to mention. Fortunately, there are many foreigners in Gulangyu who, witnessing the Japanese army's frenzy and in order to maintain the peace and order of Gulangyu and protect their own interests, the French Consul came forward to negotiate. The Japanese side also realized that sending troops to rush around every day was meaningless, so they took the opportunity to temporarily soften their approach and instead dispatched detectives in groups to openly and secretly investigate on the streets and alleys. More than 20 people have been arrested. It is said that on January 13th, 13 patriotic compatriots were brutally murdered. At the same time, detectives were dispatched to patrol refugee shelters. Any young person who caught their attention was interrogated and detained. At night, under the pretext of arresting unstable elements, they scaled walls and sneaked in, engaging in rape, robbery, and other bandit-like activities. The innocent refugees suffered terribly and could only swallow their anger and weep silently. Gulangyu was originally known as a "Shangri-La," but now it has become a dark and terrifying world.</p>
<h3>Indiscriminate Bombing by Aircraft, Japanese Warships Attempt to Harass the Fujian Coast Without Success, All Warships Have Turned and Sailed to Xiamen</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the beginning of January this year, when Japanese warships harassed Xiutu in Jinjiang County and Xia'an in Hui'an County on the Fujian coast, no aircraft or warships have been seen for two months, and the area has been very peaceful. However, the Japanese side recently had another attempt to invade the Fujian coast. On the 6th of this month, nine Japanese warships suddenly arrived from Xiamen and anchored off the coasts of Haicheng, Tong'an, Jinjiang, and Hui'an counties, dividing and stationing themselves in the waters of Haicang, Jimei, Xiutu, and Xia'an. They launched speedboats to intercept passing civilian ships (a total of three ships were seized, resulting in losses of more than 40,000 yuan) and inspected foreign merchant ships. On the 7th, Japanese warships anchored in Tong'an opened fire on Jimei three times from 3:00 AM to 9:00 AM, totaling 18 shots, destroying one civilian house and killing one water buffalo. Japanese warships anchored in Haicheng opened fire on Haicang once, totaling nine shots, all of which landed on the beach or in wasteland, causing no losses. On the afternoon of the 8th, four aircraft took off from Japanese warships anchored in Hui'an, scouting the counties of Haicheng, Longxi, Nan'an, Tong'an, Jinjiang, and Hui'an. They dropped bombs in three locations in Tong'an County (Jimei), Jinjiang County (Anbu), and Hui'an County (Xiutu). A total of 19 bombs were dropped in Jimei, damaging the Jimei Wharf and Jimei Elementary School. Six bombs were dropped in Anbu, and dozens of machine gun rounds were fired, destroying 18 civilian ships and one house, killing 12 civilians and wounding 12. Five bombs were dropped in Xiutu, sinking three civilian ships. By the 9th, the Japanese warships, having achieved their disruptive purposes, all</p>
<p>Sailed Back to Xiamen</p>
<p>And a small aircraft carrier, anchored off the mouth of the Min River in Fuzhou, the waters of Nan Gantang in Lianjiang County, the East Sha Island of Mazu, and the Meihua Port of Changle County, launched speedboats to raid and seize four fishing boats and two cargo ships, all of which were set on fire. The fate of the crew members is unknown. From 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM on the 10th, aircraft took off from the aircraft carrier four times, scouting the Min River estuary. Fuzhou issued air raid alerts four times. The aircraft also dropped bombs at Changmen twice, totaling six bombs, all of which landed in the mountains without causing any damage. On the morning of the 11th, eight aircraft again took off from the aircraft carrier and went to Lianjiang and Changchong to scout the coast, dropping four bombs in Guantou, Lianjiang County, sinking one barge, killing one person and injuring three. Two Japanese warships also arrived in Pinghai, Putian County, on the 10th from Xiamen. Each carried one aircraft, and on the afternoon of the 11th, they flew to the coastlines of Fuzhou, Putian, Xianyou, and Hui'an counties for reconnaissance. The two warships then sailed to Chongwu in Hui'an County and fired tens of thousands of shells at the shore in the evening, all of which landed on the beach. By the morning of the 12th, the three warships and aircraft carrier anchored outside the Min River estuary had all sailed to the Baiquan waters and could no longer be seen from Worry Gate. The two warships anchored in Chongwu sailed towards Xiamen. The harassment of the coastal areas for several days has now</p>
<p>Finally Ended Peacefully</p>
<p>However, according to general observations, the Japanese side's combat power in China is weakening daily. In the plains of Ningbo, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, there is no defense to hold. Guerrilla forces come and go freely, exhausting the Japanese army and making it impossible to cope. Although the southeast of Fujian Province is coastal, a few dozen or a hundred or so miles inland, there are undulating mountains and dense forests, making it a natural guerrilla area. Moreover, the people are brave and good at fighting, and there are many hidden guns, making it an excellent place for guerrilla forces. It will definitely not be easy for the Japanese side to occupy it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Harass Jiangyin, Puppet Detective Chief Killed</h3>
<p>Changyinsha Correspondence: The situation in southeast Jiangyin has been tense recently. Although the Japanese troops entrenched in the city are carrying out unusually tight defense measures, a Japanese soldier in plain clothes was wounded at Puxie Bridge, a small market about a mile outside the east gate, the day before yesterday. The Japanese army, claiming it was a guerrilla base, set it on fire, and more than 60 houses were burned to the ground. On the morning of the 21st, Yang Hanqing, a detective chief of the Japanese special forces, was shot and killed. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese side closed the city gates and launched a major search, only apprehending dozens of suspects, all of whom were taken to the Kempeitai headquarters at the Zhang family's mansion on West Street and subjected to torture. However, no clues have been found so far.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Self-Defense Force Headquarters Ordered to Be Abolished</h3>
<p>Qin County Correspondence: In accordance with the provisions of the wartime national military training program, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has ordered the abolition of the Provincial People's Self-Defense Force Headquarters and transferred its affairs to the National Military Training Department. Yesterday, special notices were distributed to all counties to comply and report on the handling of handover procedures. It is reported that all matters concerning the Provincial People's Self-Defense Force Headquarters will henceforth be handled by the National Military Training Department.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in the Suburbs of Changzhou, Chinese Forces Score Repeated Victories</h3>
<p>Wujin Correspondence: A Chinese guerrilla force of more than 100 men rushed to the section from Changzhou to Lihe Bridge the day before yesterday, surrounding the puppet police station and killing two puppet police on the spot, capturing six alive, and confiscating all their weapons. However, the Japanese troops in Changzhou City learned of this and sent troops out of the city to reach Lihe Bridge. The guerrilla forces immediately dispersed and broke up the Japanese troops in separate attacks. Thirteen Japanese soldiers were killed, and many more were wounded. Fourteen rifles and two small mortars were abandoned. In addition, in Daixi Bridge Town, Dongtan Village, and behind Xishan Island in the 20-kilometer southern district, Wangting Town, Qingyang Town, and Jiuxuan Huangtang Town, fierce battles have broken out between the Chinese army's Ye Detachment and the Japanese army in recent days, and all have been recovered by the Chinese army. Recently, the Dan-Chang Highway, which the Japanese army forced the Chinese to build, was also destroyed by the Chinese army's commando unit. On the 25th, several hundred New Fourth Army troops arrived in Banshang Town and annihilated the Japanese garrison stationed in the town, and Banshang Town was immediately recovered. The Japanese army in Changzhou City was very panicked and blindly fired artillery shells outside the city day and night, destroying many houses outside the city.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Yangzhou Suffer Setbacks</h3>
<p>Part Surrounded and Disarmed</p>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: As the battle in northern Jiangsu is proceeding fiercely, the Japanese troops in the Yangzhou area are also stirring uneasily. At dawn on the 21st, about 80 Japanese troops from Fairy Maiden Town encountered a special operations commando unit of the Chinese guerrilla force in Shao Gou Village, attached to the town. Commander Hu immediately divided his troops into three routes to surround the Japanese troops, killing 13 Japanese soldiers and seizing more than 10 Type 38 rifles. At about 9:00 AM the next morning, more than 100 Japanese troops, along with several light and heavy machine guns and mortars, advanced from Li Dian Town towards Touqiao. Zhong, the leader of a detachment of the guerrilla force's Fang Detachment, immediately led his troops to meet the enemy and fired machine guns, causing the Japanese troops to flee in panic. It is reported that the Japanese army, failing in their two attempts, may continue to launch large-scale attacks. The Fang Detachment has ordered its subordinates to be on strict alert.</p>

<h3>Detailed Record of the Third National Education Conference (Continued 5)</h3>
<p>Various Education Reform Programs Adopted</p>
<p>Motions on Special Considerations for Anti-Japanese War and National Reconstruction Education</p>
<p>Closing Ceremony Held and Declaration Issued</p>
<p>Special Correspondent Yi De of Shen Bao, Sent by Air from Chongqing</p>
<p>President Dai Speaks on the Problem of Social Education in China</p>
<p>(Special Correspondence from Chongqing) On the morning of March 8th, the Third National Education Conference held a memorial week, chaired by Chairman Chen, who invited President Dai Jitao to speak on the topic of "The Problem of Social Education in China," which has been recorded in this newspaper. President Dai delivered a speech, stating that social education is related to the survival of the nation, the life and death of the country, and the order and disorder of society. He hoped that educators across the country would rise up and lead its implementation. The individual's life is inextricably linked to society; even a simple piece of clothing is often connected to the entire world. The most important aspects of social education are four: (1) Newspapers. As a journalist, I know deeply that newspapers have great and far-reaching power in education. For the past 30 years, many orders and commands in China have been issued on Wangping Street in Shanghai. Good newspapers have a good impact on the country. (2) Next is the cinema. Following science, it becomes increasingly sophisticated day by day, entering schools at every moment, and fashionable clothes can be imitated from movies. (3) Showing the face of a country, the splendor of architecture can be called theaters. China has always used drama as an educational tool to change customs. Sichuan opera is based on dialogue, so it is no different from vernacular drama. Guangdong has seven major guilds, which perform for three days each year. The City God Temple is the largest among these seven temples, and the stage is built to be magnificent, costing more than one million yuan. Singing opera in the city connects the villagers in the surrounding countryside who come to watch the play. The depth of its penetration into the hearts of the people can be seen from this. (4) The fourth is entertainment venues, such as magic shows, martial arts performances, storytelling, big drum, money board, and storytelling performers, who have greater power than even the greatest orators. From this perspective, school education must be coordinated with social education; otherwise, ten days of exposure to the sun is not as effective as one day of frost in destroying things. Dai spoke on these four matters for an hour and a half, and his outstanding eloquence was admirable.</p>
<h3>Morning of the Ninth Day, Tenth General Assembly</h3>
<p>The Third National Education Conference was originally scheduled to close on March 7th, but due to the large number of cases, it was extended for two days. On the morning of the ninth day, the ninth general assembly was held, and various education improvement programs submitted by the Ministry of Education were revised and adopted by the whole body.</p>
<p>Special Considerations for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction</p>
<p>An ad hoc motion was also passed on the "special considerations that should be given to education in the great era of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction," which was divided into (A) education institutions and (B) education administrative institutions. The considerations were: (1) The principles of education should not be changed due to wartime. (2) Strive for normal educational facilities. (3) Spiritual mobilization. (4) Establish wartime lectures. (5) Wartime service. (6) Special training in knowledge and skills. (7) Increase supplemental teaching materials at noon. (8) Strictly implement military training. (9) Special education for the masses during wartime. (10) Wartime compulsory education. (11) Accelerate the cultivation of talents needed in the present era. (12) There should be specially formed organizations. (13) Increase the salaries of education workers in the war zone. (14) When providing relief to primary and secondary school teachers in the war zone, relevant work related to the War of Resistance should be assigned.</p>
<p>Afternoon of the Ninth Day</p>
<p>Held Closing Ceremony</p>
<p>Chairman Chen Lifu Delivered Closing Remarks. The closing ceremony was held at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the ninth day. First, the declaration was discussed and passed, followed by Chairman Chen delivering closing remarks. In addition to thanking and accepting the proposals, he earnestly emphasized: (1) Society must understand education, and then the implementation of education will have resistance removed and dynamism increased. (2) The Three Principles of the People in practice are the spirit of creation, which is production, and this is called wisdom. Nationalism is the spirit of sacrifice, which is self-improvement, and this is called courage. Democracy is the spirit of self-government, which is unity, and this is called benevolence. (3) Advocate Chinese language, history, geography, mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Chinese history and geography create patriotic nations from the root up. Mathematics, physics, and chemistry create modern nations to catch up head-on. Educators should promote the spirit of the nation. Educators not only bear the mission of the modern age but must also see the future. In this way, one can speak of "education as a century-long plan." Common standards are essential for national construction. It is permissible to use different methods to achieve the common standards decided this time.</p>
<p>Jiang Menglin and Kong Xiangxi Delivered Speeches One After Another</p>
<p>Vice Chairman Jiang Menglin delivered a speech, which was very brief. He believed that the difference between this meeting and the previous one was that the second meeting was rich in ideals, while this one focused on facts, all of which came from the hardships of experience. Chairman Chen has high aspirations, a broad vision, and a humble heart. We should work hard to advance based on the proposals and the Ministry's intentions. Now that President Kong has been sitting here for so long, like a primary school student listening to a lecture, I would like to offer a few words and wish everyone success.</p>
<p>President Kong delivered a speech, which lasted about an hour, mostly to encourage people, emphasizing the need to implement moral, intellectual, and physical education. He also elaborated on the various educational discussions, earning a lot of applause.</p>
<p>Military Committee and Others Host Banquet for Delegates</p>
<p>On the evening of the ninth day, the Military Committee, the Control Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Central Party Headquarters hosted a banquet for the delegates at the old site of the military headquarters. The hosts, Chen Guofu, He Yingqin, Zhu Jiahua, and Ding Weifen, were present. Chairman Yu Youren delivered a speech during the banquet. Then, Wang Longhui reported on diplomacy, and He Yingqin reported on military affairs, lasting three hours. He reported on the current military situation and various military statistics one by one. The listeners were all invigorated.</p>
<h3>Zhuang Zexuan Discusses Problems in Higher Education Reform (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Cultivate Talents for Reorganizing and Building the Interior</p>
<p>Cultivate Specialized Talents for Immigration and Colonizing the Border Regions</p>
<p>Higher education institutions that previously focused on reorganizing the interior were unfortunately located in the war zone, which forced most of them to suspend operations. Only the Jiangsu Provincial College of Education was left, having been relocated to Guangxi, while the Rural Administration Training Institute, jointly run by five universities, was relocated to Guizhou Dingfan and renamed the Rural Administration College. I believe that each province should establish such an institution, or reorganize an existing higher education institution. Of course, the work of reorganizing the interior must be carried out in close cooperation with the local government. The faculty required by such institutions should consist mainly of experts in various fields of social science. After providing students with basic training in the first year, training should focus on the urgent problems of the interior, rather than grouping students by academic departments. Training should focus on how to deal with people and things, learning from practice and teaching from practice, and jointly solving problems. The discussion of problems and the experience of various places should be exchanged for reference.</p>
<p>Higher education institutions that previously focused on border region development were too few, and since the War of Resistance, the need for such institutions has become even more urgent. I believe that at least three or four centers should be selected in the Northwest, Southwest, and coastal areas to concentrate human and financial resources and establish three or four higher education institutions to assist the development of border region and overseas enterprises. In the Northwest and Southwest, the application of natural sciences should be the main body of the curriculum. After providing students with basic training in the first year, training should be divided into groups in the fields of colonization, water conservancy, transportation, heavy industry, light industry, metallurgy, mining, medicine, and health. In the social sciences, emphasis should be placed on the study of cultures other than the Han Chinese. In the coastal areas, the application of social sciences should be the main body of the curriculum. After providing students with basic training in the first year, the focus of training should be on the development of education, finance, industrial and commercial enterprises, factory management, and transportation in overseas regions, with the study of cultures in various overseas regions as a common compulsory subject. Immigration work is not easy and should first be carried out on a small scale, gradually expanding. Problems encountered should be jointly studied by teachers, students, and immigrants to find solutions.</p>
<p>Higher education institutions that have been moved out of the war zone or were originally located in non-war zones and have not suffered great losses should continue their original work and cultivate academic and specialized talents. How to divide labor and cooperate in order to save money and achieve greater results is also worth planning comprehensively. If the entire reallocation is carried out in this way or there are too many original professors, the government should subsidize them to go abroad to teach or serve. As far as I know, overseas Chinese are very willing to pay part of the travel expenses and welcome scholars who are familiar with the situation in the motherland to give systematic academic lectures. At the same time, they can help study the methods for developing overseas enterprises. The central government may wish to follow the example of the primary and secondary school teacher service corps and organize a university professor service corps to serve overseas. If all of this can be done, it will not only help the current War of Resistance but also benefit the national rejuvenation in the future. (End)</p>

<h3>"North China"'s Ban on Legal Tender and Its Future</h3>
<p>(Record of the First Symposium of This Publication)</p>
<p>Date: March 18th of this year, starting at 12:00 noon</p>
<p>Location: Conference Hall on the Fifth Floor of the Newspaper Building</p>
<p>Starting Point of the Discussion</p>
<p>Zhang Yifan:</p>
<p>Today, I am honored that you all have taken time out of your busy schedules to participate in this publication's symposium. This publication feels extremely honored. Each of you has profound research not only in the academic aspects of currency and finance but also in the practical aspects and the economic realities of China and Japan. What this publication would like to ask you today is about the legal tender (fabi) issue, which is currently attracting unanimous attention both domestically and internationally. That is, the legal tender issue that Japan has been trying to undermine day and night, and has been undermining for a long time, but which remains stubbornly unshaken to this day. The foundation of legal tender was originally very solid. Furthermore, the loan for the Exchange Equalization Fund established by China and the United Kingdom is even stronger, like a wall of reinforced concrete. Nevertheless, we should still discuss Japan's attitude towards legal tender and study why their sabotage efforts have continuously failed. We might as well speculate on what tricks they will play in the future. Please, gentlemen, do not hesitate to give your guidance!</p>
<p>Tang Qingzeng:</p>
<p>Regarding this issue, there can be two different views. From the perspective of the overall situation, Japan's ban on legal tender in North China may not have much effect. This is because: (1) the banknotes of the United Reserve Bank cannot circulate in areas controlled by our guerrillas; (2) the center of finance has a tendency to shift from urban areas to the interior, so the areas designated by Japan for the use of United Reserve Bank banknotes cannot have a significant effect; (3) the patriotism of the people makes them harbor a kind of discrimination against counterfeit currency. With the above three points, one can imagine that it may be somewhat impossible for Japan to immediately destroy the foundation of legal tender at present. Therefore, what we often pay attention to may be local issues, such as speculation or the black market. The key to solving these problems cannot ignore the role played by foreign banks. The fundamental solution is to concentrate all import and export foreign exchange in government-designated banks, then the power of the black market will naturally diminish day by day.</p>
<p>Zhang Yifan:</p>
<p>The main reason for the occurrence of black market venues is probably psychological. Because legal tender itself is a managed currency system, in addition to economic conditions such as gold reserves, there are also the political conditions of the country. Even the gold standard currency system will waver during wartime, let alone when the other party is trying to undermine the legal tender. If everyone can understand more about the legal tender itself and Japan's intentions towards it, then the psychological conditions will naturally become more complete.</p>
<p>Japanese Conspiracy Yao Qingsan:</p>
<p>Japan's promotion of the United Reserve Bank banknotes and the ban on legal tender in North China this time, although mainly for economic purposes, may also contain political purposes. Because changes in currency can affect people's attitudes towards the government. In other words, if legal tender is circulating in a certain place, then the people of that place hope that the legal tender will not depreciate. Therefore, they also hope that the National Government supporting the legal tender can achieve victory. If the United Reserve Bank banknotes have achieved a circulating position, then the people only have the United Reserve Bank banknotes in their hands. This may change their psychology towards the government. They may hope for the permanent existence of the North China Provisional Government. This is the reason why the Japanese government desperately wants to destroy the legal tender and desperately promote counterfeit currency. In addition, Japan wants to promote counterfeit United Reserve banknotes in North China, aiming to make North China's finance join the "Japan Group", so that it can gain many advantages in trade. Even the payment of military salaries can be done with United Reserve Bank banknotes. Using United Reserve Bank banknotes, of course, means that Japan owes money to the United Reserve Bank. To put it nicely, it can be regarded as the United Reserve Bank depositing money with the Japanese. Thus, all of Japan's expenses in North China can be paid without spending its own money. But in fact, this hope of Japan has almost completely failed. The current situation of the use of United Reserve Bank banknotes can probably be divided into three types: in the guerrilla areas, it is absolutely not used; in the concessions, it still cannot compete with legal tender. The value of legal tender is generally higher than that of United Reserve Bank banknotes; as for the so-called United Reserve Bank banknote circulation areas designated by Japan, it may be barely said to be its sphere of influence. Because in the designated areas, it is illegal to use legal tender; and it is stipulated that future money contracts must specify the number of United Reserve Bank banknotes; if legal tender is stated, the debtor can repay the debt at a 60% discount. People under this kind of pressure, of course, have to use United Reserve Bank banknotes; but this is forced use, not natural circulation. Therefore, there is no monetary credit at all, and people's hearts are still on the side of legal tender.</p>
<p>Zhu XX:</p>
<p>Chinese people support the National Government, not just for legal tender. The Japanese deliberately exaggerate this relationship to be extremely close. This is deliberately obscuring the national consciousness of China's resistance war. Japan's sabotage of legal tender has political conspiracies. Of course, we cannot deny this, but we must not believe that this is their only reason.</p>
<p>Liu Tiesun:</p>
<p>Japan's ban on legal tender in North China has both economic and political purposes. In the economic aspect, because of the ban on legal tender, Japan can block North China's resources: North China exports local products, exchanges for foreign exchange, and supplies Japan to purchase raw materials from Europe and the United States. On the other hand, it prevents North China's local products from being transported into the Central Government's sphere of influence, increasing the foreign exchange reserves of legal tender. In the political aspect, after the ban on legal tender in North China, the economic relationship between North China and the Central Government is virtually cut off. Japan hopes that it can have some effect on the people's psychology. Therefore, I believe that the method to deal with this issue should be to adopt political strategies, which is more practical.</p>
<p>Zhang Yifan:</p>
<p>Japan's absolute ban on legal tender in the occupied areas will economically create two completely different phenomena in the occupied and unoccupied areas. The circulation area of counterfeit currency is small, and Japan's attempt to concentrate the export foreign exchange of the occupied areas will naturally decrease. Isn't this a suicidal policy for them to seize export foreign exchange?</p>
<p>Wu Chengxi:</p>
<p>Cutting off the occupied areas from the non-occupied areas may not be the idea of the Japanese; however, since they now have no way to get the United Reserve Bank banknotes into the guerrilla areas, they have no choice but to create this kind of isolation first. Li Quanshi:</p>
<p>Therefore, the Japanese side is also divided into two factions, some advocating not to destroy the value of legal tender, and some advocating absolute destruction. Therefore, the current division into United Reserve Bank banknote areas and legal tender areas may be to save face. Sun Liyu:</p>
<p>When Japan initially instigated the Provisional Government to establish the "United Reserve Bank," it probably had two purposes: one was to create a new currency system in North China, linked to the Japanese yen at par, making North China join the Japanese yen group and become their economic territory; the other was to use "United Reserve Bank banknotes" as military expenses, that is, to requisition materials and reduce the burden of war expenses in other domestic regions. However, in reality, these two purposes are conflicting with each other, because to make North China join the Japanese economic group, it is necessary to maintain the value of the "United Reserve Bank banknotes" first; to raise military expenses and plunder materials from North China, it is necessary to issue "United Reserve Bank banknotes" excessively. Therefore, no matter how Japan tries to raise the value of the "United Reserve Bank banknotes," it will eventually be unable to recover its credit. The current amount of "United Reserve Bank banknotes" issued has exceeded 200 million yuan. This is not because the circulation of United Reserve Bank banknotes has increased, but it is just the result of excessively issuing its national bank notes to plunder materials. The soaring prices in North China at present precisely illustrate the severity of the local currency inflation. In short, economic matters are entirely a matter of strength. Japan's economy is weak and unable to help North China establish a new currency system; North China itself cannot obtain a large amount of foreign exchange. Failure is, of course, expected. In the future, with the depletion of the Japanese economy, the plundering of North China will become even tighter, and the credit of "United Reserve Bank banknotes" will inevitably be lost further. Their plans will eventually become dreams. This is undoubtedly true. What is hateful is that they borrowed the name of the Chinese people to plunder the materials of the Chinese people in North China, causing the people of North China to suffer extremely. This will be a major problem in the future reorganization.</p>
<p>Shi Yiweng:</p>
<p>I think there is no need to worry about the current ban on legal tender by the Japanese authorities in North China. They will not be able to ban it no matter what. This ban on legal tender was already decided when the pseudo-United Reserve Bank was established on March 10th last year. Now they want to do this, undoubtedly to implement their so-called political decrees and maintain their face. At the same time, they really hope to promote the circulation of pseudo-United Reserve Bank banknotes through this. However, the circulation of a currency must have its economic foundation. Relying solely on political power cannot be forced. The Japanese and puppet authorities in North China originally wanted to copy the old tricks in pseudo-Manchukuo: first establish a central bank, and then issue banknotes to recover the old currency. However, the situation in pseudo-Manchukuo at that time was different from the current situation in North China. The Central Bank of pseudo-Manchukuo was able to completely recover the miscellaneous banknotes within its territory within two years because (1) the pseudo-Manchukuo banknotes were backed by the Japanese yen, and the Japanese yen at that time did not depreciate and could freely purchase foreign exchange; (2) pseudo-Manchukuo's foreign trade had a surplus; (3) the quality of the miscellaneous banknotes circulating in pseudo-Manchukuo at that time was not very good. Therefore, various miscellaneous banknotes were easily defeated. However, the situation in North China is the opposite. Not only (1) the credibility of the Japanese yen—the backing of the pseudo-United Reserve Bank banknotes—is very shaky, and it is not possible to freely purchase foreign exchange; but also (2) the so-called loan of 100 million from the Japanese banking group to the pseudo-United Reserve Bank publicized by the Japanese and puppet authorities is completely a lie; (3) North China's foreign trade has a deficit; (4) Legal tender has a stable value and can purchase foreign exchange, and Chinese and foreign merchants are happy to use it. In this way, the circulation of pseudo-United Reserve Bank banknotes is naturally very weak and cannot compete with legal tender. Therefore, it is impossible for the Japanese and puppet authorities to imitate pseudo-Manchukuo.</p>
<p>However, one thing is worth noting: the Japanese and puppet authorities in North China are trying their best to seize the 50 million yuan of silver stored in the Tianjin concessions for themselves. Last year, the Japanese and puppet authorities repeatedly demanded that the British and French concessions hand over the silver, but this was rejected by the authorities of the British and French concessions. Later, the reason why the Japanese and puppet authorities repeatedly decided to block the British and French concessions was partly for this reason. However, the Japanese and puppet authorities did not give up because of this. Later, they once instructed Wang Zhulin, the president of the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, to come forward and use the so-called "civilian" power of the silver and money industry association and the chamber of commerce to demand that the British and French concessions hand over the silver. However, Wang was assassinated and killed in December last year, so this matter was delayed. However, the Japanese and puppet authorities in North China have not given up on this matter and are still secretly proceeding. Therefore, we should always be vigilant and constantly urge friendly countries to adhere to their consistent attitude.</p>
<p>Tianjin Concession Side</p>
<p>Zhang Yifan:</p>
<p>Chinese banks in the Tianjin concession have accepted counterfeit currency. What is the truth? And is this related to this matter?</p>
<p>Wu Chengxi:</p>
<p>The acceptance of counterfeit currency by Chinese banks in Tianjin was already a fact last year, not just recently. There is a historical reason for this. Originally, the deposits absorbed by various banks in Tianjin were very large, but due to the unstable situation in North China and the wider outlets for funds in the south, most of them were transported to Shanghai for use. After the July 7th Incident, the banknotes of the National Bank were continuously transported to the south. It was impossible to transport them back after the war, so when there was a shortage of chips in the market, they had to accept counterfeit currency to solve the urgent need. In October last year, the pseudo-government once threatened the banks in Tianjin, saying that it would abolish the restriction stipulated by the Ministry of Finance of the National Government that only 5% of deposits could be withdrawn per week. This was probably also a factor that prompted various banks to be involved with counterfeit currency. Now the deposits of various banks in North China have increased compared to before, and they have a slightly better way to deal with debts than before.</p>
<p>Yao Qingsan:</p>
<p>I remember that it was Pan Yugui, the "Mayor" of Tianjin, who threatened the banks, not the Provisional Government itself. But now the intellectual level of the people in North China is much higher, so his threat did not have much effect. Later, the Tianjin Bankers' Association and Pan Yugui negotiated and still maintained the original regulations restricting withdrawals, but appropriately increased the maximum withdrawal amount per week from 150 yuan to 300 yuan.</p>
<p>No Impact on Shanghai Yao Qingsan:</p>
<p>Since North China implemented foreign exchange control, Shanghai has been significantly affected. Sixty percent of North China's export foreign exchange is now taken by the United Reserve Bank. Only the remaining 40% can be freely sold; therefore, the foreign exchange required for North China's imports and the foreign exchange that can be supplied in North China's free market must have a large difference. This insufficient amount will inevitably come to Shanghai to purchase. In other words, legal tender, in addition to supplying the foreign exchange needs of Central and South China, also has to bear part of the foreign exchange needs of North China. Recently, the funds remitted from Tianjin to Shanghai have been very congested, and this situation is very serious. It is said that in order to remedy this situation, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China in Tianjin, in addition to increasing the Shanghai exchange rate, have also limited the amount of remittances per person per day. Currently, the Shanghai exchange rate is probably 60 yuan per thousand yuan, and this exchange rate may still increase.</p>
<p>Li Quanshi:</p>
<p>This phenomenon also illustrates the depreciation of United Reserve Bank banknotes. But the Japanese, who value practical benefits, will not mind. Furthermore, as long as United Reserve Bank banknotes are converted into foreign exchange, it is not necessary to promote them to the south.</p>
<p>Wu Chengxi:</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of counterfeit currency colluding with the Shanghai exchange rate, I would like to add one point. United Reserve Bank banknotes do not need to come to Central China, they are already here in effect. This has two disadvantages for Shanghai. First, it puts pressure on the issuance of national bank notes in Shanghai, and Shanghai's hot money is already very abundant. Now, adding more remittance funds will further increase the difficulty of using hot money and promote speculation. Second, after the remittance funds come to the south, the foreign exchange market will of course be greatly affected. Even if we allow the exchange rate to rise naturally and gradually reduce the amount of Shanghai exchange, we will have suffered a great loss by then. Therefore, I feel that the recent restriction on the amount of remittances and the increase in the exchange rate by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in Tianjin is indeed a crucial move.</p>
<p>Wang Zongpei:</p>
<p>The result of foreign exchange control has intensified speculation in the Shanghai market. For the past year, speculators in Shanghai have been constantly stirring up trouble in various aspects such as foreign exchange, foreign currency, shark fin, public debt, foreign merchant stocks, cotton yarn, etc., raising prices at one moment and lowering them at another. Unlucky retail investors often run into walls everywhere. Therefore, there are indeed many people who make "national disaster money," but there are also many outsiders who suffer losses!</p>
<p>Zhu Erjia:</p>
<p>From what I have seen during my travels to the provinces of Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, the value of legal tender foreign exchange is much higher in the interior than in Shanghai, and there are various enterprises such as agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce that can be developed everywhere. Therefore, regarding the problem of abundant hot money and difficulties in using funds in various banks in Shanghai, I believe that as long as the banks can lower the exchange rate between Shanghai and the interior, and further contract the Shanghai market, then on the one hand, it can enable funds to move inward and reduce the difficulty in using them, and on the other hand, it can curb fluctuations in the foreign exchange black market and other speculative markets.</p>
<p>Wei Youpei:</p>
<p>When the loan was established, after the news spread, many people who had previously purchased foreign exchange sold their foreign exchange, even Japanese banks did so. Although it was absorbed by some banks, the market price continued to rise. Therefore, after the establishment of the foreign exchange fund, the growth of the foreign exchange black market, I believe, is not because the foreign exchange fund itself is playing a role, but because under the agitation of this kind of atmosphere, the people's hearts in the foreign exchange market have become more firm.</p>
<p>Sun Liyu:</p>
<p>When Japan declared that it would ban the use of legal tender in North China after March 10th, a small number of people were afraid that there would be problems with legal tender in North China, and they all purchased foreign exchange in the black market, so the black market was under considerable pressure. However, just at this time, the British government announced the establishment of the Sino-British Foreign Exchange Fund in parliament. Everyone knew that the foundation of legal tender was solid, and there was a large amount of foreign exchange being sold off, so the black market exchange rate rose to eight and a half pence. The people of North China knew that legal tender would definitely not be a problem, and a large amount of it was hoarded, so the foreign exchange market relaxed a lot. The Japanese authorities originally thought that banning the circulation of legal tender could threaten the people to exchange legal tender for "United Reserve Bank banknotes" and obtain more foreign exchange, but this trick has now failed again.</p>
<p>Dare Not Go to "Central China"</p>
<p>Yao Qingsan:</p>
<p>Not only that, but Japan does not want to destroy legal tender in Shanghai for a temporary economic reason. Because it can take the legal tender it has plundered in North China to Shanghai to purchase foreign exchange. If legal tender in Shanghai is worthless, it will suffer even greater losses.</p>
<p>Shi Yiweng:</p>
<p>The Japanese and puppet authorities in North China are now conducting door-to-door searches in areas under their control and confiscating any legal tender they find. This kind of behavior not only does not harm the circulation of legal tender, but also strengthens the people's trust in it. From the perspective of the Japanese and puppet authorities, they have gained nothing economically, and their political losses cannot be bought back at any price. Because the general public will leave a deeper impression from this, knowing which path people who have lost the protection of their own country should take.</p>
<p>As for Central China, even the Japanese themselves advocate that legal tender should continue to exist; at least they believe that it cannot be destroyed for the time being. For example, Yoshida Seiji, the president of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, believes that it is absolutely impossible to be hasty in his view of legal tender. Moreover, recently, general business groups in Japan, such as chambers of commerce in Tokyo and Osaka, have advocated separating Central China from the so-called "Yen Group" and still using legal tender as the currency for trade in Central China. If Central China is forcibly included in the "Yen Group," then Japan's exports to Central China must be restricted; the market in the Central China area will inevitably be completely taken over by third countries. Therefore, Japanese merchants in Japan and Japanese residents in Shanghai advocate using legal tender and do not agree with overthrowing it. This view currently occupies a dominant position in Japan; and the Japanese government has already implemented their opinions. For example, the recent relaxation of export restrictions on Central China, allowing legal tender to settle the price of goods, and the trade control of the Japanese and puppet authorities in North China, treating Central China as a third country, are all obvious examples.</p>
<p>Wei Youpei:</p>
<p>The Japanese not only have no way to deal with legal tender, but also have no way to maintain the Japanese yen. No matter how strict they control capital domestically, there is still a lot of capital escaping. It is said that a certain building in Hongkou was recently bought by a Japanese merchant for a price of more than 5 million. The Japanese authorities came out and scolded them for why they did not take so much precious money back to the country to use, but instead bought such a large amount of real estate. If this rumor is reliable, it is enough to illustrate the general public's escape of funds in Japan.</p>
<p>Shi Yiweng:</p>
<p>Recently, Tsuchiya Keishiro, a famous Japanese expert on China, has also proposed a so-called "trade currency" plan to destroy legal tender in Central China. In the summer of last year, Mr. Tsuchiya had proposed a "restoring silver standard" plan to completely overthrow legal tender, but it was shelved because it could not be implemented. But this time, he advocates temporarily retaining legal tender in Central China, only suggesting that the Nanjing puppet government organize a bank, which would issue paper money that can freely purchase foreign exchange with full cash reserves. This kind of paper money is called "trade currency" and is used as a means of trade settlement (such as taels before the abolition of taels and the reform of the yuan, and the Hong Kong dollars used in trade in Guangdong). After its credit is established, it will gradually be promoted to the entire country to replace the position of legal tender. This plan is obviously a castle in the air and will certainly not be implemented. However, due to Mr. Tsuchiya's inconsistency, it can also be seen that Japan's conspiracy is only in vain, and at the same time, it is a counter-proof of China's strong national power and the consolidation of the foundation of legal tender.</p>
<p>Truth About Controlling Trade</p>
<p>Yao Qingsan:</p>
<p>This time, North China's control of exports is not as strict as expected. Only twelve categories of goods are subject to control this time. According to the statistics of 1937, the export amount of these goods was 88 million, and the re-export amount was 66 million, totaling 154 million, accounting for 40% of the total export and re-export of North China. But in reality, in addition to these twelve types, cotton, wool, leather, etc. were already under control last year. The export amount of these types was 71 million, and the re-export amount was 13 million, totaling 84 million. Combining the above-mentioned twelve types, the total is about 240 million, accounting for more than 60% of the total export and re-export of various customs offices in North China. Their control method is this: if exporters want to transport and export the twelve categories of goods under control, they must first sell the foreign exchange they can receive to the exchange bank at the official price of one shilling and two pence, and then the exchange bank will resell it to the United Reserve Bank. The exchange bank can also replenish its stock from the United Reserve Bank, and the amount of import foreign exchange it sells is limited to the amount of export bills it sells to the latter. Also, the control of exports is specified in great detail in terms of items, while the control of imports only makes regulations in principle. However, in the future implementation, I think merchants will definitely not get much freedom.</p>
<p>Sun Liyu:</p>
<p>The control of imported goods is actually also very strict. Although the announcement issued by the "China United Reserve Bank" does not specify the types of goods, importers have the obligation to submit reports when requesting foreign exchange allocation. The "United Reserve Bank" authorities examine the nature of the goods and then allocate foreign exchange, so they have a lot of room for selecting goods. Recently, the "United Reserve Bank" notified various foreign exchange banks, stipulating that more than forty types of goods such as agricultural implements and machinery have priority import rights, which can also prove that the so-called "United Reserve Bank" authorities have the intention to control imported goods. Although they stated in the announcement that various foreign exchange banks can sell foreign exchange within the scope of the amount of foreign exchange they have purchased, according to their intention to control foreign exchange - that is, to increase the foreign exchange reserves of the "United Reserve Bank" - the "United Reserve Bank" will definitely not sell all the foreign exchange it receives. Therefore, we can predict that the import of goods, except for Japanese goods, will definitely be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Yao Qingsan:</p>
<p>In the announcement of the Tianjin Customs, there are no regulations on the items of imported goods; even in the announcement of the United Reserve Bank, only random regulations are made for imported goods. But no matter what, even if the restrictions are not very strict in writing, in practice, they will still give people all kinds of obstacles in the future.</p>
<p>Example of Failure of Industrial Control</p>
<p>Zhang Yifan:</p>
<p>He wants to seize foreign exchange from the control of trade, which will inevitably make the local commerce and production more and more pressured. The use of political power in the economy requires the support of public opinion to obtain political power. The situation in North China is completely the opposite, so the stricter the control, the smaller the hope of success.</p>
<p>Wang Yutong:</p>
<p>I believe that the opposition between "United Reserve Bank banknotes" and legal tender has both economic and political effects in nature. However, it seems to focus on economics at first. They hope that by relying on the circulation of "United Reserve Bank banknotes," they can expel legal tender from the labor force scope of their occupied areas. Therefore, the first step in promoting the circulation of "United Reserve Bank banknotes" is to start from controlling the goods produced in North China, such as cotton, coal, iron, agricultural products, etc., which are all under control. It is said that at first, Japan's control of cotton and coal in North China was extremely strict; but the results were all failures. As far as coal mines are concerned, up to now, within its occupied areas, only the coal mines along the railway lines can produce coal. Other places are beyond its power. Like various places in Shanxi, due to the guerrilla warfare after clearing the fields and the lack of local labor, production has stopped. As for the cotton-producing areas, most of them are within the control of the guerrillas. It is heard that the cotton production in each area is limited to the amount needed to supply the local needs, and no excess cotton is allowed to be planted. Private transportation is also prohibited. Due to the above reasons, the Japanese side has issued an order to lift the control of cotton in North China and restore free trade. The Japanese side, in view of the failure of economic methods, will inevitably use more political methods in the future, which can be predicted.</p>
<p>Wang Zongpei:</p>
<p>Regarding the cotton control in North China, it was initially only restricted from export in the treaty ports. In the interior, Chinese merchants could still transport it freely. At that time, although the cotton production in the guerrilla areas of North China was strictly blocked by the guerrillas, the smuggling and transportation of merchants still existed. Later, the Japanese strengthened the control along the railway lines and prohibited Chinese people from transporting cotton. If found, they would all be confiscated. As a result, the smuggling merchants stopped doing it, and the source of cotton disappeared. The Japanese had no cotton to collect at all, and had no choice but to stop the control measures in the interior.</p>
<p>End of Meeting</p>
<p>Zhang Yifan:</p>
<p>The more "legal tender countermeasures" Japan plans, the more it proves that he has no way to destroy legal tender. Today, thanks to all of you, the attitude of Japan towards legal tender, the conspiracy to destroy legal tender, the environment in which legal tender is located, and its own foundation, as well as the changes in North China, and the impact on Jiangnan and the Shanghai Valley, have been deeply and clearly analyzed and prospected. This publication is very grateful. I am even more sorry that this symposium has consumed your business time and delayed your work. On behalf of this newspaper, thank you.</p>

<h3>Lido Victorious Over Rowing Club Yesterday, Crowned West Union Group C Champion</h3>

<h3>Securities: A Week of Stock Market Review: Jardine Matheson Shares Trade Briskly</h3>
<p>During the past week, trading in various stocks on the exchange was initially cautious due to tensions in Europe, resulting in a sharp decline in trading volume. However, by the weekend, the signing of a commercial agreement between Germany and Italy temporarily eased the European situation, and market sentiment revived.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson was the most actively traded stock during the week, reaching around 100,000 shares. On Monday morning, the price fell to $17.80. On Wednesday, the initial price was $18.70. At 11:30 AM, news broke that the board of directors had decided to distribute a final dividend of $2.75, which was higher than expected, boosting investor confidence and causing the price to surge to $19.50. There was no trading in the afternoon, but the curb market price had already reached $20.00. On Thursday, there was potential for further gains, but Germany's reoccupation of Memel raised concerns about further disputes, causing New York securities to fluctuate by a significant four pounds sterling. Market sentiment weakened, and the price struggled to rise, hovering around $19.50. The same was true on Friday morning. However, in the afternoon, foreign news reported that Germany and Italy had concluded a commercial agreement, and that Britain and France had abandoned the collective security plan, indicating that the European situation had temporarily stabilized. As a result, investors rushed to buy Jardine Matheson shares, causing the price to jump by half a dollar to $20.00. On Saturday, the price continued to rise, reaching a peak of $20.50. However, many investors sold to realize profits, causing the price to drop by 20-30 cents, with the closing selling price at $20.20 and the buying price one dime lower.</p>
<p>Shanghai Silver Company also saw significant trading volume, reaching 10,000 shares on the weekend alone, with prices ranging from $5.75 to $6.15. Kiangnan Dock &amp; Engineering Works also saw active trading, with the price rising to $7.00. Public Bus fluctuated between $23.75 and $24.25. Wheelock Marden initially fell to $33.00 but rebounded to $39.50 on the weekend, with sellers willing to sell at this price but buyers offering $35.00.</p>
<p>Six months ago, 100 shares of Chongsin Cotton Mill were traded at $29.75. At the end of last week, 100 shares were offered at $42.00, a significant increase.</p>
<p>Various bonds saw some activity, but price fluctuations were limited, and trading volumes were low. Rubber shares remained sluggish, with only Chan Shih Ying Trading actively traded. 20,000 shares of Lao Fo were traded during the week at $1.26. The total trading volume on the exchange from March 17 to March 23 is listed on the left: Ordinary shares $2,452,600, Rubber shares $89,200, Bonds $225,000, Total $2,766,800.</p>
<p>The Chinese stocks traded on the Chinese Merchants Securities Market last week included over 100 shares of Chinese Merchants Securities, with the price rising from $28.00 to $28.35. Shanghai Cloth Exchange shares traded at $38.00, a few cents higher than last week. Chinese Electric traded at $5.40 on Monday and $5.425 at the weekend. In addition, 30 shares of Zhejiang Industrial Bank were traded at $65.50.</p>
<h3>Grains: Limited Supply of Du Rice, Rumors of "County Government" Sealing Borders in Changshu and Wuxi</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the total supply from various sources to Hexia No. 16 was only 1-2 thousand packages of steamed buns. It is rumored that the pseudo "county government" of Changshu and Wuxi posted a notice in the local rice market the day before yesterday, implementing border closures, resulting in a very limited daily supply. This situation has a real impact on the food supply in Shanghai. It is unknown whether there will be any remedies. Market sentiment was initially subdued in the early morning, but rebounded after hearing the news. As hoarders increased their purchases, the market became active, leading to a tightening of market conditions, presenting a pattern of initial weakness followed by resilience. The prices of Northern Japonica and Bo Da Hexia rice, which were slightly reduced the day before yesterday, all returned to their previous levels. Supplies from Suzhou and Tongxiang remained stable. Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian followed suit, increasing by several cents. The supply and demand were similar, with no significant differences.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Stable Sugar Market</h3>
<p>The sugar market trend remained stable yesterday. The association's clearing price for 24 coarse white foreign wharf was $24.65, local wharf $24.45, transit goods $16.55, Dutch red $16.60, transit goods $11.00, local wharf No. 1 white $24.50, local wharf No. 1 ice $31.50, No. 2, 3, 4 local white $24.20, Tai B Dong Wharf $24.525, West Wharf $14.65, Tai H red $16.60, Tai XA $20.60, Big Golden Coin was up 30 cents from the previous market, but was not offered. Dutch coarse product was priced at $5.20. Domestic sugar was offered at a normal high-branch red of 200 units, priced at $15.20 to $14.60, down 30 to 40 cents from the previous market.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods Affected by Yongou, Hunan Lotus Suddenly Rises</h3>
<p>Hunan Lotus is suddenly rising due to a certain party invading Zhenhai and Wenzhou being bombed, hindering supplies. The market price yesterday was Hunan Xiangtan Lotus $110, Local Lake Lotus $100, Jiuxi Lotus $95. Local shops and inland sources were all purchasing, and the market appeared very strong.</p>
<h3>Seafood: New Jiangxi Mushrooms Already on Sale</h3>
<p>The first batch of new Jiangxi fragrant mushrooms, 20 pieces, have arrived and are already on sale. The price is $238.90 for general goods and $268 for thick mushrooms.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Dried Shrimp Steadies Upward</h3>
<p>The sales of Wenzhou dried shrimp have remained active recently, so the market price has been steadily rising. For example, yesterday's price was $62, which is 50 cents higher than before.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: The Season for Sea Agastache is Approaching, Suddenly Rises by Ten Dollars</h3>
<p>The previous market price for Sea Agastache was $20 per dan, with 30-40 pieces offered. Recently, with the summer season approaching and sales expanding, the price has suddenly risen. The day before yesterday, it was already selling for $30. This product is produced in Qiongya, which has been occupied, resulting in a break in supply. Furthermore, the inventory here is also scarce, so there is potential for continued price increases.</p>
<h3>The Production Price of Star Anise is Increasing</h3>
<p>The arrival and sales of star anise are balanced. The current market price is $105 per dan (bank transfer). However, according to a Hong Kong telegram yesterday, the production price has already reached (HKD) $41.50, compared to over $39 in the previous market, a real increase of $2.</p>
<h3>Metals: Thin Tinplate, Factory Demand Gradually Moving</h3>
<p>The long-silent thin tinplate has seen factories starting to purchase in recent days, but sales to customer shops remain sluggish, so trading is rare. It is reported that only 20-30 dan were offered in the past two days. The market price for 35-pound American goods is $125, British goods are selling for $120, 50-pound goods are selling for $75, and 60-pound goods are priced at $65 (all American goods). Other goods, such as Wild Chicken brand goods are selling for $105, and Juehao is priced at $85, both up one or two dollars from before. Furthermore, because there are no new arrivals, the market is quite active. And because the market's inventory is thin, market sentiment is optimistic.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops on Dongsha Island Cleared Out; Elite Chinese Troops Have Crossed the River; Authorities Implementing Decisive Strategy; Daytime Spy Organization Uncovered</h3>
<p>Two divisions of the Central government's most elite mechanized units, after crossing the Qiantang River, advanced rapidly, along the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, actively moving towards Nanjing. They have now completely controlled the outskirts of Nanjing, forming a large encirclement of the city.</p>
<p>Coastal Defenses Increasingly Enhanced</p>
<p>According to a gentleman who arrived in Shanghai from Jinhua yesterday morning, the coastal defenses of eastern Zhejiang are under the command of General Commander Liu of the ×th Army Group and Chairman Huang of Zhejiang Province. Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Taizhou are the responsibility of their respective garrison commanders. The implementation of traffic control, ship inspections, and anti-espionage work is extremely strict. All important ports have defensive fortifications and some underwater installations. The defenses are generally considered solid. Therefore, although Japanese warships have repeatedly harassed the area in the past month, their attempts have been unsuccessful. Now, the Military Commission, due to the tense situation, is strengthening the defenses. In addition to deploying five divisions of elite Central Army troops, Deputy Director of the Political Department Zhou Enlai has been sent to eastern Zhejiang to consult with Chairman Huang, Commander Liu, and others on all matters, and the decided measures will be implemented immediately. Therefore, the defenses of eastern Zhejiang are increasingly enhanced. If the Japanese invade, they will be met with a fierce counterattack.</p>
<p>All Japanese Troops Attempting to Land Eliminated</p>
<p>Japanese troops, attempting to gain access to eastern Zhejiang, have been shelling and harassing the coastal areas of Zhenhai, Haimen, Dinghai, and Xiangshan from time to time. However, due to the strict defenses of the Chinese army, they have not succeeded. Starting on the 19th of this month, they turned to attack the Fuchun River, landing stealthily on Wenjia Weir, Dongsha Island. The garrison troops bravely engaged in a fierce battle. After the arrival of five divisions of Chinese reinforcements, they began to encircle and attack. According to a telegram received yesterday from relevant sources, the landed Japanese troops have been completely eliminated. Currently, both sides are facing each other across the Qiantang River.</p>
<p>Authorities Launch Major Crackdown on Traitors</p>
<p>According to sources in the shipping industry, after the tense situation in eastern Zhejiang, the authorities began a major crackdown on lurking bandits in Yin County, Wenzhou, Haimen, and other places on the 23rd to clear out traitors in the rear. They have uncovered three Japanese-established spy organizations in eastern Zhejiang, and over seventy people involved in conspiracies to respond to the riots have been arrested and are being interrogated by the Tenth Army Group's legal department, where they will be severely punished. Most of these rioters are Zhejiang pirates, plotting to disrupt the rear, and their leader is Korean. They have a large number of firearms supplied by the Japanese. The crackdown is continuing in various parts of eastern Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Wenzhou and Ningbo Peaceful, Shipping Continues as Usual</p>
<p>The American company China America's Tang Sai Wheel arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo at 7:00 AM yesterday. According to the ship's crew, the situation in Ningbo has been as peaceful as ever for several days, and the people are particularly calm. There are no Japanese warships anchored outside Zhenhai Port. The situation in Wenzhou and Taizhou is also normal. As for the reports in Shanghai newspapers that coastal residents were being evacuated, the Ningbo authorities have denied it. Therefore, the Oujiang and Yongjiang ports are currently unobstructed, and foreign ships are operating as usual. The German merchant ship Hanna departed directly from Shanghai to Ningbo at 4:00 PM on the 25th. The company has received a telegram from the ship, confirming that it safely entered the port around 9:00 AM on the 26th. The old Taiping Wheel, which was supposed to be blockading Zhenhai Port, is still parked in its original location and has not moved. It can be seen that the authorities do not consider it necessary to completely blockade Zhenhai Port. Vigilance at all ports has not been relaxed, and inspections of passengers and cargo are thorough. Unless there is a new development in the situation, shipping between Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Wenzhou will not be interrupted.</p>
<h3>Urge Rapid Closure of Breaches in the Upper Yellow River; Representatives from Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui Issue Telegram Request; Hope Charitable Organizations Will Provide Assistance as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>Zhang Tao and others, representatives of the Yellow River flood closure petitioners from Henan, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu and Anhui, issued a telegraph requesting funds from various charitable groups to rapidly close the breaches in the upper Yellow River: To the Shanghai Shenbao, transferring to the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee, the British Famine Relief in China Committee, the International Relief Committee, and various Chinese and foreign charitable organizations, the Yellow River flood disaster last autumn affected several provinces, causing widespread devastation, and immense loss of life and property. The calamity inflicted on all living beings leaves us weeping without tears. With the war still raging, all breaches in the riverbank have not yet been closed, fertile land remains submerged, and houses are flooded. Millions of orphans and widows have no home to return to, dying of hunger and cold, with no chance of survival. Faced with the imminent threat of bullets, it is as if we are in hell. The old and weak are dying, the young and strong are displaced, and the wails of women and children sadden even heaven and the gods. We and others, surviving from the brink of death, are ashamed to still be breathing. Thinking of this, our hearts are breaking. Looking back at our homeland, we weep tears of blood. Fortunately, we have repeatedly received the benevolent kindness of Chinese and foreign people, generously extending a helping hand to those in distress, and providing a compassionate rescue. With gratitude, we are deeply moved, and although the disaster is severe and funds are scarce, the ability to extend our lives by even one day is akin to recreating and nurturing us. We have heard that benevolence knows no bounds, and this kindness and virtue will be unforgettable for generations to come. Now, we respectfully represent the millions of dying victims in Henan, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu and Anhui, kneeling and weeping to beg all the great benefactors of China and foreign countries to rapidly close the breaches in the upper Yellow River, so that the water in the lower reaches will have a route to discharge, allowing the sea to be restored to land, and emerging from fire and water to find refuge. We have heard that international and British organizations are deeply concerned about the disaster areas in China, and are eagerly donating funds. However, the closure of the Yellow River breaches is hindered by its proximity to the war zone, causing some concerns. We believe that compassion knows no boundaries, and all sentient beings share compassion. We implore the philanthropists of the international charitable organizations, taking a third-party stance, and with the benevolence and courage of God, to consult with military and diplomatic experts. If they could designate the breach closure and construction areas as outside the war zone, the displaced people would be able to return home and work diligently, without the need for supervision, quickly restoring their former livelihoods. Chinese agricultural production is the source of raw materials for the world's industrial and commercial nations. The principle of mutual assistance in life is closely related. Taking advantage of this spring famine, work can be used to replace relief, achieving twice the result with half the effort. If delayed until the arrival of the flood season, there will be no salvation, and even if the great Yu were reborn, he would be helpless. Rescuing people from life and death is critical at this moment, for a moment's delay will bring eternal regret. We implore you, benefactors, to have great compassion and provide assistance as soon as possible, turning negative relief funds into positive results, and utilizing resources to improve people's lives. The millions of survivors in our disaster areas, generation after generation, will forever be grateful for the merits and virtues of your organization. God have mercy, our distress is urgent. We, representatives of the Yellow River flood closure petitioners from Henan, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu and Anhui, Zhang Tao, Dong Baoqian, Jiang Wei, Chang Hengfang, Lü Yin Nan, Sha Yi, Sheng Zhi Ren, Dong Yunsheng, Shangguan Yongming, Zhang Zhen, Tian Xinshan, Xie Yuhua, Hu Fuhua, Hu Peiru, Xu Yangwo, Chen Yinnan, Xing Yaopu, Wang Tongchou, Mei Shaochun, kowtow and weep.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Exported to Siam to be Prohibited</h3>
<p>The artificial silk industry in various countries has developed rapidly in recent years, with most of its sales going to China and Siam. Therefore, the Chinese silk industry has been greatly affected, with a situation that is difficult to reverse. According to sources in the silk industry, the Siamese government plans to implement a ban on the import of artificial silk from various countries in the near future. The purpose is to protect the domestic silk weaving industry, and it is also due to Article 12 of the new treaty completed with various countries, which clearly stipulates that the Siamese government has the right to promulgate new regulations prohibiting the import of all fake (artificial) products manufactured by science. After the implementation of this regulation, the sales of Japanese artificial silk in Siam will be most severely affected, as Japan accounts for the largest share of artificial silk exports to Siam.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Actually Regards the North Bank of Suzhou Creek as an Area Under Military Occupation; Says It Does Not Exceed the Scope of International Law; Employing Puppet Police is a Matter Within its Authority</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that when the Japanese spokesman received reporters yesterday (25th), he said that the Japanese side considers the entire area north of Suzhou Creek to be an area under military occupation. When asked if this attitude of the Japanese side is based on international law, the spokesman replied that the Japanese military's military occupation of some parts of the public concession does not exceed the scope of international law. Regarding the recent implementation of traffic regulations on the north bank of Suzhou Creek, the spokesman said that since the area where these regulations are implemented is within the area occupied by the Japanese military, there is no need to submit them to the Municipal Council for approval. Furthermore, the implementation has greatly improved the traffic situation in some parts of Hongkou and Yangshupu. When asked how the Japanese authorities defend the use of Chinese people wearing "Great Way" uniforms to assist Japanese sentries at the Garden Bridge, the spokesman replied that the Japanese side believes that the implementation of this method is within its authority. In addition, policing rights and patrol rights are also within the authority of the invading troops.</p>
<h3>Japanese Command Headquarters in Hongqiao Attacked: Detailed Information - A Collaboration Between the 4th Security Regiment and the 1st Loyal and Righteous Army</h3>
<p>Further details regarding the previously reported attack on the Japanese command headquarters in Hongqiao by the Shanghai West Guerrilla Unit have come to light. According to detailed reports, the attack on Hongqiao, which took place on March 16th of this year, was a collaborative effort between Zhao Lian, a lieutenant colonel under the command of Xu Leisheng, the regimental commander of the 4th Regiment of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Command, and the 1st Battalion of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army. The operation was commanded by Commander ×. Initially, there was an encounter battle, which then escalated into a siege. Over thirty enemy troops were killed, and our forces suffered over ten casualties. The battle lasted until dawn. However, the claim that enemy aircraft were destroyed has not been confirmed. The regiment plans to reward and commend the officers and soldiers who distinguished themselves in this battle. In addition, the regiment will submit a detailed report to higher authorities, requesting compensation for the fallen officers, soldiers, and martyrs, in order to encourage future actions. As for the so-called guerrilla leader, Hou Junren, after the fall of the Shanghai suburbs, he had been entrusted with establishing the Southeast National Salvation Self-Defense Corps Headquarters, organizing district self-defense corps, and serving alongside Xu Bainian, the current head of the pseudo-Qingpu Finance Bureau, as district corps commanders. However, Hou treated the matter as child's play and disregarded human life. He abused his authority by openly establishing an opium and heroin company, engaging in rampant drug trafficking. Even more abhorrently, he colluded with the enemy, accepting appointments as the township head of the 12th township of the pseudo-Jiading organization and as the commander of the pseudo-Qingxiang (Clearance) Command. This matter was reported to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Third War Area Headquarters for review. Instructions were issued jointly to immediately disband the unit, execute the leader Hou Junren on the spot, and order Company Commander Zhao Jiayou to lead his troops to carry out the order. The unit was purged of undesirable elements, the best elements were selected and incorporated, and they were placed under the command of Company Commander Zhao. The traitor Hou, upon hearing the news, fled into hiding. A reward is currently being offered for his arrest and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Gan Rice Transported to Zhejiang for Regulation - 200,000 Dan per Month - Effective from April</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government has established a Food Management Committee to make every effort to unblock sources, assess prices, and maintain food supplies. It has now reached an agreement with the Jiangxi Provincial Government on measures for transporting Gan rice to Zhejiang for regulation. The original text is as follows: (1) The Zhejiang and Jiangxi Provincial Governments will respectively telegraph the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau to allow rice arriving at stations before March 11 to be loaded and transported. The quantities stored at each station and the daily amount transported will be reported separately to the Zhejiang and Jiangxi Provincial Governments. (2) From now on, rice at stations in Jiangxi that is not handled by the Wartime Trade Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Industrial and Commercial Management Office will be prohibited from being transported. (3) Under the current circumstances (such as when Jiangxi Province needs to purchase a large amount of military rice, both sides may negotiate a different amount), Jiangxi Province will transport 100,000 bags per month, each bag containing 200 "shi jin" (approximately 264 pounds), which is 200,000 "dan," to Zhejiang starting from April. (4) The price of rice transported to Zhejiang by the Jiangxi Wartime Trade Department should be the local market price in Zhejiang, including all transportation costs, with no additional charges. In consideration of the interests of Zhejiang rice merchants, a discount may be given. However, this does not apply when the price of Jiangxi rice, plus all expenses, is higher than the price of Zhejiang rice. In addition, the Zhejiang and Jiangxi Provincial Governments agreed on the transportation of Gan rice to Zhejiang, initially at 80,000 bags per month, i.e., 160,000 "dan," and then changed to 100,000 bags per month, i.e., 200,000 "dan," for a period of five months. The contract was signed on the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Reinforcing Hangzhou - Attacked on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Line - Over 200 Japanese Soldiers Killed or Wounded - Japanese Troops Conduct Large-Scale Searches in the Suburbs</h3>
<p>At around 9:00 AM on the 24th, 2,000 Japanese soldiers boarded trains from Hongkou to the North Railway Station to reinforce Hangzhou. When the train reached the border between Shanghai County and Songjiang on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, it was ambushed by Chinese guerrilla forces. The train's locomotive was immediately destroyed, and machine-gun fire and grenades were unleashed. The Japanese soldiers on board were thrown into chaos and jumped off to resist. The guerrillas immediately retreated and disappeared without a trace. An inspection revealed that a total of over 200 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. Apart from the remaining troops continuing towards Hangzhou, the Japanese troops cleaned up the battlefield the day before yesterday (the 25th), loaded the bodies onto covered trucks, and transported them to Hongkou for cremation. The wounded were sent to hospitals in Nanshi and Hongkou for treatment. Therefore, the Japanese forces have been conducting large-scale searches in the suburbs since the day before yesterday, causing extreme panic.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Driven Out of Mishidu</p>
<p>Over a hundred Japanese troops from the Yamano Unit stationed in Mishidu were attacked by the Gong Unit of the guerrilla forces the night before last (the 24th). The two sides engaged in fierce combat. The Japanese troops, unable to withstand the attack, were forced to retreat. Mishidu was then recaptured by the Ding Unit. The villagers who had been ravaged by the Japanese troops once again saw the light of day.</p>
<p>Pseudo-Police in Nanhui Stage a Mutiny</p>
<p>The Japanese troops began a "general offensive" against the guerrilla forces in the Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha counties. Due to the limited number of troops, a unit of puppet troops was mobilized as reinforcements. Some time ago, the Japanese ordered the police from the puppet "Police Bureau" in Nanhui to engage in combat. The leaders of the "puppet police" pretended to agree, and when the unit was transferred to the suburbs, they suddenly staged a mutiny last night (the 25th), killing four Japanese soldiers who were monitoring them. All sixty-odd members of the unit defected to the guerrilla forces and were placed under the command of a unit to attack the Japanese troops.</p>
<h3>Additional Docks to Be Constructed at the Sichuan Road Bridge - Decision Made by the Works Committee - Approved by the Board of Directors</h3>
<p>Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the docks in Nanshi and Guangfu Road have been closed, making it very inconvenient for ships traveling to and from the interior. To address this, the Public Works Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement has decided to extend the docks westwards along Suzhou Road from the Zhapu Road Bridge. Additional docks will also be built in the Chinese Park at the base of the Sichuan Road Bridge to facilitate berthing. This matter has now been approved by the board of directors and can be implemented immediately.</p>
<h3>Obvious Markings Should Be Used When Promoting Goods - Factory Names, Trademarks, and Brands Should Be Clear to Avoid Suspicion</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Cloth Industry Association yesterday announced to its members that they must carefully identify whether goods are domestic products when promoting goods, so as to avoid being detained along the way during inspections. At this time of resistance against Japan, goods from certain countries are being boycotted. Recently, there have been reports of goods being detained in various places. Although the goods may not be from a certain country, they lack clear markings, making it difficult to identify them and leading to them being suspected and detained. To avoid similar incidents from happening to members, the association hereby requests all stores to pay attention to the following when adding goods in the future: do not send goods that do not have factory names and goods whose trademarks and brands are blurred and incomplete, making them unidentifiable, in order to avoid misunderstandings and disputes during inspections along the way.</p>
<h3>Bus Stop at the Nissho Building Discussed for Dispersal - Request to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association for Consultation - To Facilitate Traffic and Ensure Safety</h3>

It has been learned that the Citizens' Federation, after learning of the situation, has forwarded a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association in the Public Concession, requesting them to consult with the Shanghai Municipal Council, the bus company, the tram company, and other relevant authorities to discuss dispersal.</p>
<h3>Concession Authorities Support Limiting Rice Prices - Soy Bean and Rice Market Area Too Small - Announcement of Temporary Suspension of New Members Joining</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Soy Bean and Rice Market Management Committee has temporarily suspended new members joining due to the limited area of the market. The concession authorities have expressed their satisfaction with the efforts of the Rice Price Evaluation Committee to stabilize rice prices and maintain food supplies and have pledged their full cooperation. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Temporary Suspension of New Members Joining</p>
<p>The Shanghai Soy Bean and Rice Market Management Committee has temporarily suspended new members joining due to the limited area of the market. Yesterday, Announcement No. 64 was issued, stating that the market has seen an increasing number of new members joining recently, but the limited area of the market makes it difficult to accommodate seats. From today, new members wishing to join the market will be temporarily suspended. The public will be notified when a suitable venue is found to expand the market. A copy of this announcement has been sent to the Soy Bean and Rice Industry Association for their information.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Express Satisfaction</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee previously sent letters to the authorities of the two concessions to inform them of the establishment and rice price evaluation. Yesterday, the committee received replies from the French Municipal Council and the Shanghai Municipal Council. (1) The letter from the French Municipal Council stated that they had received letters dated the 8th and 17th of this month and understood that the committee had agreed on rice prices in the city for the convenience of the people. They were pleased to learn that the price limit of 14 yuan per "shi" for the best white rice was set to benefit the public in the current difficult situation. The French Municipal Council would follow the committee's agreement and fully cooperate in every possible way. (2) The letter from the Shanghai Municipal Council stated that they had received the letter dated the 17th of this month and were fully aware of everything, and they had noted the information regarding the organization and address of the Evaluation Committee for record.</p>
<h3>Various War Zones Actively Preparing to Establish Wartime Party and Government Work Committees - Establishing Party and Government Foundations in Guerrilla Areas - Mobilizing the People to Meet the Needs of the Second Phase of the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>Since the Central Government issued a directive to the commanders of various war zones to establish Wartime Party and Government Work Committees to promote wartime Party and government work, various war zones have begun preparations to establish these committees. Some war zones have already announced their establishment. The personnel of these committees consist of representatives from the provincial government and provincial party headquarters, as well as commanders of various war zone commands and detachments. They are responsible for promoting Party affairs and politics in the war zones and establishing Party and government foundations in guerrilla areas, organizing people's organizations, and mobilizing the people. At the same time, they will maintain close contact with Party, government, and military organs at the provincial level to facilitate the advancement of war zone work. They will also carry out various tasks such as providing relief and comfort to displaced people. Therefore, the Central Relief Commission has also sent representatives to participate. This organization is purely to meet the needs of the second phase of the War of Resistance.</p>

<h3>Large Fire at the Nissho Shipping Company Warehouse - Losses Reach 2 Million - Cause of Fire Under Investigation by the Japanese - Japanese Consulate Police Section Moves to the New Asia Hotel</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the warehouse of the Japanese Nissho Shipping Company on Huangpu Road, which caught fire at 11:15 PM on Friday, presented a desolate scene yesterday afternoon (the 25th). Tongues of flame still emerged from the pile of charred rubble, accompanied by thick smoke. Only four scorched walls remained of the massive building, their upper portions tilted precariously. The interior was a chaotic jumble of rubble.</p>
<p>The fire's intensity was evident in the damage to the adjoining shipping office of the Nissho Shipping Company, which served as the headquarters for the Japanese Consulate Police Section. The roof and upper floors were completely destroyed. Several fire trucks continued to spray water into the ruins. Japanese Consul General Miura, Japanese Army Colonel Hirota, Shanghai Municipal Police Department Chief Akagi, along with representatives from the Japanese Navy, the Japanese Consulate, and the police department, gathered at the consulate yesterday to begin investigating the cause of the fire. Japanese sources were widely suspecting</p>
<p>Arson</p>
<p>A Japanese spokesperson told reporters last night that there had been five fires at the warehouse and other properties owned by the Nissho Shipping Company. The most recent fire occurred on December 26, when a factory belonging to the Shanghai Textile Company was destroyed. According to investigations, the fire was caused by arson using chemicals. The spokesperson said that the Japanese authorities believe that Friday night's fire was also an act of arson. The spokesperson added that</p>
<p>Guards</p>
<p>Nine Chinese and Indian guards reported that everything was normal at 6:00 PM on Friday evening, and again at 10:00 PM. However, a few minutes before 11:00 PM, a fire was discovered on the ground floor, which quickly spread and destroyed the entire building. The rooms on the third and fourth floors of the Japanese Consulate Police Section were completely destroyed, and the rooms on the first and second floors were filled with rubble. Therefore, the Police Section has temporarily moved to the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road. Also, according to the China Press,</p>
<p>Preliminary Estimates</p>
<p>The fire at the Japanese Nissho Shipping Company has caused property losses amounting to a staggering 2 million yuan. Although there is no precise calculation yet, the final figure may even exceed 2 million yuan. The property losses include a large warehouse filled with flammable materials, the Japanese Consulate Police Section building, and office buildings of the Japanese Consulate and the Nissho Shipping Company in the same row. The destroyed goods include</p>
<p>A Quantity of Cotton</p>
<p>And other merchandise detained by various merchants. The most recent shipment into the warehouse consisted of 3,000 bales of Indian cotton belonging to the Dongyang Cotton Company, an affiliate of Mitsui &amp; Co., valued at 625,000 yuan alone. Some of the cotton belonged to the Swiss merchant Fojia Foreign Company of this port. It is also reported that the warehouse contained a quantity of cotton cloth, a large amount of timber, and beer. Considering the loss of goods and buildings, the estimate of 2 million yuan seems likely. This fire is the worst</p>
<p>Since the Shift of War</p>
<p>In 1937. Twelve fire trucks and fireboats from the Public Concession arrived at the scene around 11:20 PM on Friday evening and continued to fight the fire until nearly dawn.

The results have not been disclosed. At 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the French Concession Fire Department, acting on orders from French Consul General Baodizhi, also dispatched three fire trucks to the scene. However, the fire was already under control at that time, so they returned.</p>

<h3>Entire Shipping Industry Declining Since January This Year - Japanese Shipping Ranks First in China - Great Attention Paid by British and American Governments to the Shipping Industry in China</h3>
<p>After the war, state-owned and private ships were forced to completely cease operations due to the Japanese army's blockade of the coast. Foreign merchants took the opportunity to seize shipping rights. Now, due to Japanese obstruction of navigation and refusal to open the Yangtze River, the shipping industries of Britain, the United States, France, Portugal, and Germany in China have declined, while Japanese ships have risen to the top spot. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Entire Shipping Industry Suddenly Declines</p>
<p>In August of the 27th year, imports were 9,631,130 tons, and exports were 9,420,946 tons. In September, imports were 11,026,528 tons, and exports were 10,813,654 tons. In October, imports were 12,251,224 tons, and exports were 12,001,080 tons. In November, imports were 13,516,662 tons, and exports were 13,268,765 tons. In December, imports were 14,812,920 tons, and exports were 14,616,918 tons. In January of the 28th year, imports were 1,238,182 tons, and exports were 1,148,178 tons. In February, imports were 2,405,418 tons, and exports were 2,330,195 tons.</p>
<p>Japan Monopolizes China's Shipping Industry</p>
<p>In the past, foreign shipping to China was dominated by England. Now, due to Japanese obstruction and refusal to open the Yangtze River, the tonnage of British shipping in China has decreased from 1,128,037 tons in August of last year to 713,408 tons in February of this year. Meanwhile, the tonnage of Japanese shipping has increased to 832,149 tons in February of this year, ranking first among all countries shipping to China. The coastal areas of North China and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have been monopolized by Japanese merchants. In addition to operating the Shanghai-Xiamen route, Japanese companies such as Nisshin Steamship Company are planning to open the Shanghai-Hong Kong route.</p>
<p>British and American Governments Attach Importance</p>
<p>The British and American governments have paid great attention to the Japanese obstruction of foreign ships carrying goods at Hangzhe, Haimen, and Funing in northern Jiangsu. In order to maintain their shipping routes in China, British companies such as Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson have decided not to suspend operations on their existing routes, such as the Shanghai-Qingdao-Yantai-Weihai-Tianjin route, despite the sharp decline in passengers and cargo. They are also making every effort to restore the shipping industry in China and plan to open new routes to avoid being monopolized by Japanese merchants. At the same time, they are building new ships in their home countries to be added to the various shipping routes in China.</p>
<p>Customs Statistics on Merchant Ships Traveling to and from Foreign Countries</p>
<p>Also, the customs released statistics on merchant ships traveling to and from foreign countries in February. Shanghai: 1,189,903 tons; Jiaozhou: 230,379 tons; Shantou: 221,681 tons; Tianjin: 192,684 tons; Xiamen: 119,923 tons; Qinhuangdao: 101,695 tons; Yantai: 64,748 tons; Hainan: 58,474 tons; Leizhou: 44,369 tons; Gongbei: 31,186 tons; Beihai: 22,295 tons; Wenzhou: 16,561 tons; Weihaiwei: 13,824 tons; Kowloon: 12,573 tons.</p>
<h3>Expand the Anti-Spitting Campaign - Increase Publicity - Print Pictures and Slogans to Raise Public Awareness</h3>
<p>The Cleanliness and Hygiene Anti-Spitting Campaign, initiated by the Shanghai Women's Movement Federation and the Chinese Education Bureaus of the two concessions, was launched yesterday. In addition to advising the public to promote the prohibition of spitting in public places and on the radio, pictures and slogans have also been printed and posted everywhere to increase publicity, raise public awareness throughout the city, and ensure public health. (1) Spitting everywhere will spread tuberculosis. (2) Exercise more often, bathe regularly, be healthy, and you will spit less. (3) Where do you spit? (4) Spitting everywhere can easily spread disease. (5) Spitting everywhere is a bad habit, we must correct it.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Organizations Initiate a Memorial Service for Shen Lianbi</h3>
<p>Shen Lianbi, courtesy name Mingjun, graduated from National Peking University in his early years. He devoted himself to cultural and charitable causes, making significant contributions. He served as a member of the National Economic Council Transportation Committee, secretary of the International Radio Station, director of the Charity Association of the Seven Counties of Songjiang, director of the Songjiang County Education Bureau, principal of Songjiang County Girls' Middle School, and founder of the New Songjiang Society. When Songjiang fell two years ago, Shen moved to Shanghai. Unfortunately, he developed tuberculosis and died at noon on March 16 of this year at the Chinese Red Cross Hospital. Shen's relatives and friends in Shanghai, as well as various organizations in Songjiang, plan to hold a memorial service. The first preparatory meeting was held at Songjiang Middle School, Lane 384, Fuzhou Road on the afternoon of March 25.

<h3>Traffic Safety Campaign: Pedestrian Violations Should Be Fined; The Biggest Difficulty Is Guiding Pedestrians, and Detailed Rules Are Being Drafted</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that a major proposal related to the upcoming "Safety First" campaign has been put forward, stating that pedestrians and drivers who disregard traffic lights or cross roads outside designated areas will be fined. It is said that the biggest difficulty is guiding pedestrians, as statistics show that most traffic accidents are not the fault of drivers, but are caused by pedestrians' own carelessness. The arrival in Shanghai of millions of farmers and people from small towns, who are not accustomed to crowded traffic, has made this problem even more difficult. It is now proposed to first launch a large-scale campaign to warn pedestrians to cross crowded roads only within designated lines, to pay attention to traffic regulations even when they have to proceed against a red light, and to strictly abide by traffic regulations. In the past few years, the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council has attempted to guide pedestrians in this way. Yellow lines have been drawn on crowded streets, and notices saying "Cross Here" have been posted. However, due to a lack of publicity, the significance of this method has been reduced and it has been ineffective. It is now proposed that after a large-scale campaign, pedestrians who violate the regulations should be fined. Some also suggest imposing small fines on violators and giving the fines to the patrol officers who catch the violators at the scene. Police officers should also be required to carry receipts. The detailed rules for "Safety First" week are currently being drafted by a nine-person committee.</p>
<h3>Customs Wusong Sub-Station: News of Restoration; Whether Smuggling Can Be Effectively Suppressed Is Still in Doubt</h3>
<p>The news that the Jianghai Customs is restoring police powers at Wusong was reported yesterday. According to the Modern News Agency, the Jianghai Customs Wusong sub-station has been in negotiations with the Japanese side through the British Customs Commissioner Mr. [Luo Fu De] for nearly half a year. The issue was not resolved due to repeated excuses from the Japanese side, and the Japanese side repeatedly demanded that when the Jianghai Customs restores the Wusong sub-station, it should increase the number of Japanese ordinary customs officers as a condition. The negotiations on this matter have now come to an end. Mr. [Luo] agreed to increase the number of Japanese ordinary customs officers, and the Wusong sub-station is scheduled to resume operations on the first of next month. However, the Japanese side has not yet agreed to return the original customs sub-station building at Wusong. Therefore, the customs will use ships as mobile offices, with Western customs officers as directors, accompanied by Chinese customs officers and newly added Japanese customs officers. As for whether a large number of smuggled goods entering the Yangtze River line through the Wusong port can be effectively suppressed after the Wusong sub-station is restored, foreigners are observing that it is still in doubt. It is also reported that the original customs Wusong search team will also be restored at the same time, exercising the power to inspect prohibited items and tax-evading goods on incoming and outgoing ships. Chinese, Western, and Japanese customs officers of the entire team will be stationed on the lower level of the [Yasheng] transport ship returned by the Japanese side. Therefore, the customs power in the Wusong area has ostensibly returned to its pre-war normal state.</p>

<h3>Public Concession Police Authorities: Strict Search Operations; No Slackening in the Past Two Weeks, From Temples to Curtains, Uninterrupted Rotation; Armed Patrols by Military Squads</h3>
<p>The Public Concession police authorities are strictly carrying out search operations to prevent terrorist incidents. The campaign has been vigorous and has continued for two weeks without any slackening. Armed Chinese and foreign police officers from various police stations are dispatched daily and are quite serious. Vehicle inspections have become busier recently. Armed detectives are stationed at important border areas to search private, taxi, public buses, and trams. During curfew hours, there are many cars traveling back and forth. Cars that are usually not inspected are often stopped for searches of passengers inside. A large number of police officers are dispatched after 5:00 AM, and the patrols continue until late at night. The strictness of the precautions is unprecedented recently. Search operations in the Shanghai West area are even more intense, paying more attention to areas along the Suzhou River, such as the Fujian Road Bridge, Old Garbage Bridge, North Mud City Bridge, the Tenth Road bus stop at the Xinzha Road intersection, the Wuzhen Road, the two bridges of Xinzha, the intersection of Meibai Ge Road and Xinzha Road, the areas in Shanghai West and the areas where roads are built beyond the boundary such as the intersection of Labor Sheng Road, Pinlang Road, Singapore Road, Kangnao Tuo Road, Xinzha Road, Aiwen Yi Road, Yu Garden Road, Jing'an Temple Road on Jiaozhou Road. Western and Indian police officers in groups of three, leading four or five Chinese police officers, take turns guarding these areas all day, checking trams, public buses, taxis, rickshaws, and pedestrians. Inspection teams on the roads and sidewalks are also constantly moving. Red security vehicles are dispatched from time to time to carry out inspections anytime and anywhere. Small squads of soldiers from the garrisons of various countries also carry out armed patrols. During inspections, thirty or forty Chinese, Western, and Indian police officers work in shifts. Western officers and Chinese police officers search vehicles and pedestrians, while Indian police officers carry long guns and stand guard, creating a very strict atmosphere.</p>
<h3>The Case of the Dazhong Funeral Home: Manager Found Not Guilty</h3>
<p>The British-owned Dazhong Funeral Home on Changping Road in Shanghai West is a joint-stock company. [Hu Zhenhua], an employee of the Chinese Weixin Office, serves as the Chinese manager. [Zheng Bosheng], a major shareholder of the funeral home, introduced [Qian Weichen] and [Qian Yuansheng] to serve as general affairs staff members for the business. On September 11 of last year, [Wang Hongxiang], a bill collector at the funeral home, embezzled 14.6 yuan when collecting payment from customer [Chen Honglai]. [Hu] discovered this and, believing the opportunity had arrived, colluded with [Wang], instructing [Wang] to say that the embezzled money was split with the two [Qians]. [Hu] then reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, and [Wang] and the two [Qians] were detained and brought to the First Special Court. During the court hearing, [Wang] suddenly had a change of heart and confessed that the false accusations against [Qian Weichen] and [Qian Yuansheng] were instigated by [Hu Zhenhua]. As a result, [Wang] was sentenced to eight months in prison, and the two [Qians] were declared not guilty. However, [Hu] was still unwilling to give up and hired former Municipal Council lawyer [Mei Shuo Lan] to appeal to the Municipal Council Legal Department against the not-guilty verdict for the [Qians]. However, after review by the Second Branch of the High Court, it was also determined that [Wang Hongxiang]'s testimony in the first trial, pointing to [Hu] instigating the false accusations, was true. Therefore, the Municipal Council's appeal was rejected. Before the case was finalized, [Hu] suddenly published advertisements in newspapers, still claiming that the two [Qians] had colluded with [Wang Hongxiang] to embezzle funds and fired them. [Qian Weichen] and [Qian Yuansheng], after reading the newspaper, felt that [Hu] had first falsely accused them of a crime and then published false advertisements defaming their reputations, making it difficult for them to live in society. The depth of his malice was truly unforgivable. Therefore, based on [Wang Hongxiang]'s confession, the Second Branch of the High Court's determination, and the advertisements published by [Hu Zhenhua], they hired lawyers [Fan Gang] and [Yu Enliang] to file a lawsuit against [Hu Zhenhua] and [Wang Hongxiang] in the criminal division of the First Special Court, accusing them of false accusation and defamation, requesting that they be punished according to Articles 169, 309, and 310 of the Criminal Law, and also filed a civil suit, requesting that [Hu Zhenhua] be ordered to publish the verdict in various newspapers for three days each, as well as restore their reputations. Yesterday, Judge [Fu Lin] opened the Second Criminal Court to hear the case. [Hu Zhenhua] hired lawyer [Gu Hanli], and [Wang Hongxiang] hired lawyer [Chen Chengyin] for their defense. First, lawyer [Yu] stated the process and presented evidence, stating that the plaintiffs would not have filed this lawsuit if the defendant had not published advertisements destroying the plaintiffs' reputations and making it difficult for them to gain a foothold in society. It was only because [Hu] repeatedly acted with malicious intent that they had to file this lawsuit. When questioned, both defendants denied having colluded to falsely accuse the plaintiffs, claiming that the plaintiffs' actions were retaliatory. After arguments by both lawyers, the judge ruled in court that both [Hu Zhenhua] and [Wang Hongxiang] were not guilty. It is said that [Qian Weichen] and others were dissatisfied with the verdict and decided to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court.</p>
<h3>Owner of Huahua Milk Factory Kidnapped by Bandits; Japanese Puppets Ignore It</h3>
<p>Bandits in the [Yanpu] area of Pudong are rampant, robbing and kidnapping without restraint. [Chen Yinyin], a 50+ year old man from Nanhui, opened the Huahua Milk Factory next to the Changchang [Zhanzhen] on the west side of Pudong Avenue, possessing modest assets. He was coveted by bandits. Around 9:00 PM the night before, more than a dozen men, each wielding weapons, broke into the factory and kidnapped [Chen]. As of last night, he was still in danger. The Japanese puppet authorities are ignoring the kidnappers.</p>
<h3>Young Master of Lanhe [Jinglong] Rice Shop Kidnapped</h3>
<p>[Zhang Yougen]'s third son, [Xiuyu] (currently 18 years old and a practitioner of geomancy), was kidnapped by seven or eight strong men while having dinner at home around 7:00 PM the night before. Afterward, [Yougen], out of paternal affection, asked people to inquire and find ways to rescue him, but there has been no concrete news for many days, causing extreme anxiety to the family.</p>
<h3>Illegal Gambling Spreads in the Concession; Public Police Break Up Two Locations, Punish Separately; 41 Gamblers Arrested for Gambling on Pai Gow</h3>
<p>Various gambling dens in Shanghai West have sprung up one after another, and the current period is the most prosperous. There are all kinds of gambling activities. After the [Hua Jun Biedong Dui] repeatedly cracked down on major gambling dens and issued warnings, the gamblers were all alarmed. Recently, there has been talk of moving the dens to Hongkou. It is said that this plan is still under consideration by their protectors, and its implementation is pending. However, the protectors will control the gambling dens, and soon all existing large and small gambling dens, as well as flower club headquarters and branches, will be ordered to stop, re-register, and the number of gambling dens will be limited to five. Gamblers, in order to prolong their lives, are competing to curry favor with their "masters." According to speculation, Hollywood, [Rongsheng], [Guangsheng], [Dasheng], and [Daxin] have been pre-selected as the controlled gambling dens after the reorganization. The relocation of the dens will be subject to the approval of the protectors at that time. As for the flower clubs, their situation is very different from other types of gambling and cannot be touched by outsiders. Therefore, those advocating control believe that the flower clubs should still be operated by experienced hands such as [Mao A Xiang], [Yu Ru Seng] (i.e., [Yu Shi Sheng]), and [Li Xiao Bao] under the names of [Yi Ji] Headquarters and [Ji Ji] Branch, without major changes. [Mao], [Yu], and [Li] were especially motivated by this exceptional arrangement, and vigorously recruited the unemployed, luring them with benefits to serve as lookouts. A local youth, who claimed not to be a traitor, was lured by profit to close the secret room inside his bungalow behind No. 1254 Jing'an Temple Road to accommodate men and women who came to gamble on flower clubs. The house, including the shop in front, belonged to the Teng family and was managed by Teng's grandmother, who rented the shop to [Liu Changyu]. [Teng Ying], who used to work in the Finance Bureau of the Municipal Government, has been unemployed since the National Army withdrew westward. Recently, he was lured by [Mao]'s henchmen, allowing him to work for a gold salary per day, and sold himself as a lookout. Detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station investigated and learned of this, and went to arrest him the other day. [Liu] was also present and was arrested as well. 150-160 flower club slips and more than 60 yuan in gambling money were confiscated. On the 25th, they were sent to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer [Qian Xunjiu] prosecuted them according to law, requesting punishment. Judge Meng questioned [Teng]'s confession that after becoming unemployed, the "Dadao" Municipal Government had summoned him, but he had not gone because he did not want to be a traitor, and that he was now working as a lookout and was not a traitor. [Liu], on the other hand, firmly denied that he had induced people to gamble on flower clubs, saying that he was mistakenly arrested. As a result, [Teng Ying] was sentenced to six months in prison, which could be commuted to a fine of two yuan per day of the sentence, and the gambling money and gambling tools were confiscated. [Liu Changyu] was acquitted and released. There was also [Liu Yulin], a native of Tianjin who used to be a smoker and became a lookout because of his addiction to opium, unemployment, and poverty, joined the flower club organization, and served as a lookout. He rented a room from [Mao Afu], a resident of No. 1, Lane 332, Seymour Road, as a place to sell opium and induce gambling. The other day, detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station rushed there and arrested [Liu], his landlord [Mao Afu], his accomplice [Shen Jinquan], and [Wang Alin] and other men and women who had been gambling on flower clubs, a total of seven people. Together with the confiscated evidence, they were sent to the court the other day. After questioning by Judge Meng, [Liu] was sentenced to one year in prison for gambling and eight months in prison for opium offenses, to be served concurrently for a total of one year and two months, with public rights deprived for three years. [Shen] was sentenced to five months in prison, which could be commuted to a fine of two yuan per day. [Mao] was sentenced to two months in prison, which could be commuted to a fine of one yuan per day. The other several people, including [Wang], were fined 15 yuan each, and the gambling money and gambling tools for opium and gambling were confiscated. In addition, the gambling den at the Mainland Hotel at No. 69 Yuchaqing Road was also verified by detective [Zhou Yushan] of the Chengdu Road Police Station. The other day, he rushed to arrest them with Chinese and Western detectives. As soon as they reached the fourth floor, the hotel waiter [Su Jinyuan] dared to alert them. He was arrested, together with [Gu Liangyu], who was the ringleader of the Pai Gow gambling in Room 〇四, and nineteen other male and female gamblers. Someone else opened a gambling den for Pai Gow at No. 9, Lane 139, Dagu Road. The other day, detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station secretly went there and arrested twenty male and female gamblers, including [Yang Li Shi]. Because the boss had not yet been arrested, the twenty people were each allowed to deposit 30 yuan in the police station as bail. Yesterday morning, the eleven people involved in the above two cases were brought to the First Special Court for separate trials by Judge Meng. The police lawyer stated that the gambling den at the Mainland Hotel had been separately sued in the police court. After questioning each defendant one by one in court, Judge Gu was sentenced to five months in prison and [Su] was sentenced to two months in prison, both of which could be commuted to a fine of three yuan per day. The nineteen people caught in the Mainland Hotel were each fined 50 yuan, and the twenty people, including [Yang Li Shi], were each fined 40 yuan. The gambling tools were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Husband is a Drifter by Nature; Young Woman Sues for Divorce</h3>
<p>[Zhang Chai Miaodi], a young woman from Ningbo, 23 years old this year, was married to [Zhang Jintang] on March 26th of the 25th year of the Republic with a matchmaker. Now, [Zhang Rong Miaodi] has hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the civil court of the Second Special Court against her husband, [Zhang Jintang], seeking a divorce. It is said that since the marriage, the two parties have not had any children, but the defendant is a drifter by nature and has repeatedly refused to change despite repeated persuasion. Last year, the defendant took advantage of the plaintiff's absence to move all the clothes and furniture in the house. When the plaintiff returned home and discovered this, she could not find them. Therefore, she hired a lawyer to post a notice in the newspaper, but there was no news. The defendant has indeed abandoned the plaintiff maliciously for more than a year. Therefore, in accordance with Article 1052, Paragraph 5 of the Civil Code, she is suing for a divorce. After receiving the complaint, the court summoned the plaintiff's lawyer to the Civil Court 7 on the other day by Judge [Wu Xiaoke]. The defendant did not appear. The court stated that according to what was written on the complaint, the defendant lived at No. 11 [Deshengli], [Baier] Road, and the bailiff was sent to deliver the summons, but no one accepted it. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant actually lived there and requested another summons. The court agreed to reschedule the hearing to the 28th to summon the defendant for questioning.</p>

<p>[Gan Zhenqing], a native of [Yinxianggang], 63 years old this year, moved to No. 27 [Shuziwan], [Xuhong] Road, Xujiahui, Shanghai West, to avoid the war. He made a living by selling vegetables. On the morning of the 13th of this month, [Gan] went out to sell vegetables. When he was walking through the intersection of [Haige] Road, Xujiahui, a garbage truck No. 28 of the French Public Works Department, driven by driver [Zhou Fengyu] (11 years old, from Jiangbei), was coming from east to west and was turning north. [Gan] did not have time to dodge and was knocked to the ground. His left foot was crushed by the rear wheels of the truck. A patrol officer saw this and sent the injured person to Guangci Hospital for treatment. He also reported to the police station. [Gan] died from his injuries on the other day due to his age and the severity of the injuries. The hospital notified the police station, who took the body to the autopsy station. Yesterday, Prosecutor [Wang Ren] of the Second Special Court arrived at the station and confirmed that the deceased died from being crushed by the truck. The deceased's son, [Gan Jinzhou], signed a statement to claim the body. The family requested that the police station negotiate with the defendant to compensate for the losses.</p>
<h3>Rental Disputes in [Wenlan Fang], [Julai Da] Road</h3>
<p>The houses in [Wenlan Fang] on [Julai Da] Road in the French Concession are owned by [Wu Wenjing], [Jiang Lansun], etc., and are named "[Wenlan Fang]". There are more than twenty tenants in total. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War two years ago, the population living in these houses suddenly increased, and the cost of tap water also increased significantly. From January 1st of this year, the landlord suddenly stopped supplying tap water to the tenants, asking the tenants to install their own water meters. The tenants discussed how to deal with this, all saying that this measure was equivalent to a disguised rent increase. They repeatedly decided to negotiate with the landlord, but there was no satisfactory resolution. Recently, the landlord has refused to accept the rent paid by the tenants, causing panic among the tenants. Yesterday afternoon, they invited all the tenants to discuss and decided to hire a lawyer to negotiate with the landlord. If the landlord continues to refuse to accept the rent, they will deposit it with the court and seek relief.</p>

<p>[Xu Xiao Er Zi] (33 years old), a native of Jiangbei residing at No. 16 [Huixi] Street, [Xujiahui] Town, was a gambler. He was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for robbery. Recently, he was released after serving his term and is now working as a ticket checker at the [Tongxing Yangzhou] Theater at the entrance of [Fahua Dongzhen] (i.e., along [Haige] Road). He is also one of the shareholders of the theater, so his life is still not difficult. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, seven or eight men in different outfits were loitering and peeping near the theater. At that time, [Xu] went out of the theater. After walking a few steps, he was caught up by a man wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants, who pulled out a pistol and fired at [Xu]. He was shot three times, once in the head and twice in the body, and fell to the ground and died instantly. The murderer, seeing that his goal had been achieved, calmly escaped. After the incident, the [Zhengshi] Middle School Japanese Constable Team learned of it and immediately went to inspect the scene and searched the town. The deceased was wearing a suit and black leather shoes, and died at the entrance of the theater. Later, his family was notified to come and claim the body. The deceased left behind a wife and three children, and his wife is still pregnant. According to those familiar with the matter, the cause of the case seems to be a vendetta.</p>

<h3>Internal Conflict Between Fake "Army" and Fake "Police": Japanese Side Protects Fake "Army," Chuan Xiao'an Uses Two-Faced Tactics</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the fake "army" in the Shangnan Railway area of Pudong, a recent internal conflict has erupted with the local fake "police bureau" over matters of interest. The Japanese army is protecting the fake "army," causing the turmoil to escalate and spread to the fake "city government." The incident began a week ago when Wang Jia'san, the fake "police chief" of Yangsi Bridge, harbored resentment against the fake "army." At that time, three members of the fake "army" were extorting civilians, and he arrested them. The fake "leader" requested the Japanese army to intercede for their release, but was unsuccessful. He slapped Wang in the face several times. Wang, feeling humiliated, complained to Lu Ying. Lu reported the situation to the fake "city government" and sought help from the Japanese special service agency to punish the offending Japanese officer. However, not only was this goal not achieved, but the local Japanese army instead forced the dismissal of Wang Jia'san, the insulted fake "police chief." Lu and Chuan found themselves in a difficult situation, so they devised a hasty plan to release the three arrested members of the fake "army" as a gesture of appeasement. They also promoted Wang, the fake "chief," to become the fake "branch bureau chief" of Beiqiao, both to show respect for the Japanese army's face and to avoid Wang's suffering. The conflict between the Japanese and the puppets was thus resolved. Wang's vacancy was filled by Cheng Yunkun, a fake police officer from Minhang. Yin Zhongli, the former fake "branch bureau chief" of Beiqiao, was taken by surprise, unfairly replaced, and forced to ask the "bureau" to reassign him, effectively losing his job. It is said that Yin was originally protected by Zhao Guangdi, the former head of the fake "police bureau's inspection department" and head of the fake "public utilities bureau." Zhao has fallen from power, so Yin had no support and was forced to leave his position.</p>

<h3>Anti-Spitting Campaign</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>Tuberculosis germs are tiny things invisible to the naked eye, but tuberculosis is fiercer than a tiger. In our country, more than 300 out of every 100,000 residents die of tuberculosis each year! Taking 450 million people as a calculation, about 1.6 million people die of tuberculosis every year. This is such a terrifying number!</p>
<p>Tuberculosis germs are called tubercle bacilli, and they are often mixed with sputum. Therefore, people with tuberculosis can spread tuberculosis anywhere if they spit indiscriminately.</p>
<p>If we want to prevent the spread of tuberculosis, we must first practice not spitting indiscriminately. Spitting indiscriminately is not only easy to spread diseases, but also unclean and unsightly. This is a very bad habit that must be eradicated!</p>
<p>Now the Shanghai Women's Federation, with the support and cooperation of the two concessions and the Chinese Education Bureau, has launched an anti-spitting campaign and has scheduled an anti-spitting campaign promotion week from March 26 to April 1. During this week, they will go to various schools and public places to give speeches to promote the harm of spitting and the appropriate methods for disposing of sputum. People who like to spit indiscriminately will no longer spit randomly.</p>
<p>The Federation has compiled and printed an anti-spitting teaching material for primary school students to read. I hope that every primary school student in the city will have a copy, so that they can develop the habit of not spitting from an early age, and the public will no longer have the bad habit of spitting indiscriminately.</p>
<p>The Federation has also specially made a "Health is Treasure" badge for people participating in the campaign to wear. This badge has two meanings: first, everyone who wears the badge must swear not to spit indiscriminately in the future; if they have to spit, they must spit in a spittoon or handkerchief. Second, everyone who wears the badge must always advise others not to spit indiscriminately.</p>
<h3>Anti-Spitting Campaign and Tuberculosis Prevention Methods</h3>
<p>— Lai Douyan</p>
<p>Foreigners often ridicule our country as the "Sick Man of East Asia," because our physique is far inferior to theirs, especially because there are more people in our country with tuberculosis than in any other country. According to recent statistics, more than 300 out of every 100,000 residents die of tuberculosis each year in our country, while Japan has only 186, France 164, Italy 154, Germany 98, Britain 97, and the United States has the least, only 80.</p>
<p>Calculating based on the national population of 450 million, approximately 1.6 million people die of tuberculosis in our country each year, and there are 30 times more patients than this (i.e., 48 million people). This number is truly alarming. Assuming that the social loss from the death of one person is about 2,000 national currency units, then the loss from tuberculosis deaths in our country each year is at least 320 million national currency units! If this huge sum were used to build primary schools (each primary school costs about 10,000 national currency units), then 320,000 schools could be built each year, benefiting many children.</p>
<p>The economic loss of tuberculosis is as mentioned above, and its pathogen is a bacterium called the tubercle bacillus. This bacterium likes to be mixed with sputum the most. Therefore, if people with tuberculosis have no public morality and spit indiscriminately, the tubercle bacillus can take this opportunity to infect others. A doctor recently checked the sputum on the streets and other public places in Shanghai and found that a quarter of it contained tubercle bacilli. After this bacteria dries, it can fly everywhere and enter the human body, causing illness. What a dangerous thing to think about spitting is.</p>
<p>The most effective way to avoid the dangers of tuberculosis is to promote the "anti-spitting campaign." From a negative point of view, it is best for each of us not to spit, and if we absolutely cannot control ourselves, we should spit the sputum into a spittoon or handkerchief to avoid harming others. From a positive point of view, we must pay attention to daily hygiene, such as exercising more, breathing more fresh air, and taking more baths, so that our bodies can become stronger and sputum will naturally decrease.</p>
<p>Finally, we must think about our responsibility to others. We should not only take care of ourselves, but also persuade others, such as family members, neighbors, and classmates, to make them aware of the harm of spitting and understand the way to maintain health. If all the children do this, what should the country worry about being strong?</p>
<p>Common Sense of Life</p>
<h3>Please Don't Spit!</h3>
<p>— Jifeng</p>
<p>Spitting, this thing, in the eyes of us Chinese, is a very small thing. It doesn't require an "anti-spitting campaign." If there is phlegm, just spit it out, and that's it. There is no need to ask where to spit. Fortunately, when you cough, my throat also itches, so I spit it out as well. You spit, I spit, we all spit a few times, and things are considered free and equal, and don't contain unfair effects. So whether you spit on the tram, spit on the road, or even if you don't like spitting, it's completely free. What's the big deal?</p>
<p>However, generally speaking, the gentlemen who talk about hygiene talk about the harm of spitting, and it's so logical that I don't know whether to believe it or not. Now I have excerpted the documents of the anti-spitting campaign below for everyone to study.</p>
<p>Sputum is a low-level mucus in the human lungs, secreted from the mucous membranes of the throat and trachea. When we catch a cold and cough, the sputum follows and is spat out from the mouth. It is something excreted from the body. According to people who understand medicine, people with weak bodies and insufficient resistance often catch colds due to cold and warm imbalances, which causes inflammation in the throat and trachea, and the secretions increase particularly. Therefore, people with colds and coughs have particularly increased sputum. In addition, people who smoke, or people who live in unclean and unventilated houses, also have particularly increased sputum. In short, no matter what kind of sputum, before it is spit out, it can absorb dust and impurities in the air, and make it stick to the cilia and mucus on the nostrils (sputum). And human health, is very good. But after the sputum is spit out, it becomes an excretion, which not only contains dust and impurities, but also contains tubercle bacilli or bacilli due to the weakness of each person's body. This kind of bacteria is easy to adhere with the help of mucus. If the mucus is dried by sunlight, it can float in the wind again and invade people's trachea, thus spreading the disease, which is very dangerous. Many people think that spitting consumes energy, so they do not advocate spitting, but swallow the sputum into their stomachs. Alas! Now that we know that the contents of the sputum are just some dust and mucus, and some are even mixed with bacteria, it is a very unclean and harmful thing, so how can the sputum be swallowed, but since the sputum cannot be swallowed, it should be spat out. Most Chinese people do not pay attention to hygiene and spit indiscriminately, which has become a habit. There is no spittoon in the room, so they spit on the ground. Even if there is a spittoon, they are sometimes too lazy to walk a few steps and spit casually. As for the roads outside, they are even spittoons for everyone, so that there are thick and thin sputum everywhere, which makes people disgusted when they see it. It must be known that spitting indiscriminately is not only unclean and unsightly, but also extremely unhygienic. According to microscopic examination, the bacteria contained in a mouthful of sputum can sometimes be as many as tens of millions, which is really terrible, so spitting is a small matter, but the relationship is very important. In order to deal with spitting, it is best to make people not spit. If there is sputum, it is necessary to spit, then there must be a place to spit. Generally, in the room, if there is a spittoon, it should be spat into the spittoon (it is better to put some disinfectant chemicals such as carbolic acid in the spittoon to kill the bacteria in the sputum). If there is no spittoon, then it must be spat into paper or a towel for burning or washing. If you are walking on the road, of course, it is not suitable to have a spittoon, so you can only spit it into paper, a towel, or a ditch, and never spit it on the road.</p>
<p>However, one thing must be noted, that is, now there are many educated people who know that spitting indiscriminately is unhygienic, so they carry a handkerchief with them. When they have to spit, they take out the handkerchief and spit into it. After spitting, they still put it in their pocket. After a while, when they have to spit again, they take it out again and spit into it. They do not wash it all day or two, so that the sputum that was spat out earlier evaporates through the temperature of the body and dries early. When they take it out again for the next spit, with a shake, the bacteria in the original sputum will detach from the handkerchief and fly into the air, which has the danger of spreading the disease. Therefore, the handkerchief of a spitting person is still unsanitary if it is not washed quickly. Compared to this, it is more reasonable to spit the sputum into paper and burn it in the fire after a while. Otherwise, prepare two handkerchiefs, so that after one spit, you will not take it out again, and if you want to spit again, you can use the second handkerchief. Exchange each other, and then wash them clean, which is also not impossible.</p>
<p>The above said, or the method of dealing with when there is sputum and it is necessary to spit. As for the method of preventing not spitting, it must be considered from the root. We study the causes of sputum, which are generally caused by air and coal smoke, and physical weakness. According to this, we can open more windows in our residences to circulate air, and often sweep to pay attention to cleanliness, then sputum can also be relatively reduced.</p>
<p>In addition, we must also take more baths, smoke less, remove the accumulation of dirt on the body, and make the skin excrete smoothly. On the one hand, we must exercise, and then the causes of sputum can also be relatively reduced. May everyone pay attention to it at all times.</p>
<p>Public Lyrics</p>
<h3>Wen Tianxiang</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengfei</p>
<p>(Wen Tianxiang's aria) The winds and clouds bring illusions, regret is boundless. The Song Dynasty's mountains and rivers are destined to end, but a speck of loyal heart shines like the sun and moon, a lifetime of heroic spirit pierces through the long rainbow.</p>
<p>(Spoken) I, Wen Tianxiang, courtesy name Songrui, am from Jishui, Jiangxi. This time, defending Chaozhou, just because the rebel general Zhang Hongfan's forces are fierce and mighty, I was trapped and captured alive by him. Alas! Having come to this point, I can only sacrifice this life to the fullest to be loyal.</p>
<p>(Singing) I think of my lifelong integrity and impartiality, a speck of loyal heart to repay the Song Dynasty. It's all because the Mongol barbarians invaded, and the mountains and rivers were lost, a regret that is hard to dispel. This time, I mistakenly fell into a trap, and they captured me alive. I can only throw away my head, which is not a pity. Wait for the future historians to record my name. While he was deep in thought, how could he know that Hongfan was inviting him from inside with great respect?</p>
<p>(Narration) Zhang Hongfan was sitting in his camp at this time, inviting Tianxiang inside, wanting to persuade him. Therefore, seeing Tianxiang being brought up bound, he hurriedly greeted him with a smiling face, saying—</p>
<p>(Zhang's spoken words) Prime Minister Wen, I, Hongfan, have greatly offended your esteemed presence. I hope the old Prime Minister will forgive my offense.</p>
<p>(Narration) As Zhang Hongfan spoke, he intended to respectfully salute Prime Minister Wen, untie the ropes, and make a very sincere gesture, but Wen Tianxiang simply closed his eyes and said nothing. Hongfan forced a laugh and said—</p>
<p>(Zhang's spoken words) Prime Minister Wen, I am being polite. Hahaha, I must ask for your forgiveness.</p>
<p>(Wen's spoken words) You are so respectful to me, what do you want me to do?</p>
<p>(Zhang's spoken words) Haha, Hongfan has nothing else in mind, only that your good friend Zhang Shijie of Mount Wuyi is very powerful. I intend to ask the Prime Minister to write a letter, inviting him to surrender to our Yuan Dynasty, to avoid my general having to fight him.</p>
<p>(Wen sneers) Hahaha, are you mistaken?</p>
<p>(Wen's singing) I am a loyal minister of the Song Dynasty. I must repay the emperor's favor. I only know the Song Dynasty as my parents. If my parents are there, I will live. Today, I am ashamed that the Song Dynasty is hard to protect. How can I steal another life? You still want me to write a friendly letter, what kind of heart is it to trap people in injustice? I think, since ancient times, who can avoid death? Leave a loyal heart shining in history. This is my old poem, a lifelong ambition. Everyone has their own ambitions, do not encroach on each other.</p>
<p>(Wen's spoken words) Everyone has their own ambitions, you don't need to say more, quickly get out of my sight.</p>
<p>(Narration) Seeing that he was dignified and unyielding, Zhang Hongfan had no choice but to imprison him. After a few days, the Yuan Dynasty conquered Mount Wuyi, and the Yuan soldiers held a grand celebration feast in the camp. Hongfan then invited Tianxiang out again and said to him,</p>
<p>(Zhang's spoken words) Mr. Wen, you are a hero. Now listen to my candid advice.</p>
<p>(Zhang's singing) Now the Southern Song has fallen, and the mighty Yuan Dynasty has been established. It is often said that going against heaven is difficult, but following heaven's will is naturally prosperous. You are a dignified Prime Minister of the Song Dynasty, a generation of hero with a famous name. Why not create a new career, surrender to my lord without worry, and you can still be granted official rank and establish a court. Those who understand the times are heroes, advise you to consider it carefully.</p>
<p>(Wen says) Bah! You are talking nonsense. Do you think that I, Wen, am a fickle person?</p>
<p>(Wen's singing) Loyal ministers do not serve two masters, their determination is as firm as copper and iron. I am already a prime minister of the Song Dynasty, how can I be an official of the Yuan Dynasty again? As the saying goes, no eggs are left unbroken under an overturned nest, how can one survive when the country is destroyed? Moreover, since ancient times, China has been called a great nation, and the barbarians have been subservient for thousands of years. Now that barbarians are emperors, what face do I have to live in this world? I might as well die a clean death, to avoid being scolded by others. Therefore, we each have our own lord, do not talk nonsense like a madman. You can cut me down if you want, a loyal minister is not afraid of death in the Yellow Springs.</p>
<p>(Wen's spoken words) You don't need to say more, kill me if you want, slice me if you want. I, Wen Tianxiang, am not a greedy or profit-seeking person. If the country is gone, it is useless to live.</p>
<p>(Narration) Seeing that he was unyielding, Zhang Hongfan had no choice but to send him to Yanjing. The Yuan Prime Minister Boluo also wanted to persuade Tianxiang to surrender, but Tianxiang was determined and refused to comply. Therefore, he was finally killed in Yanjing, but his reputation will never fade away.</p>
<p>(Wen's singing) Boluo also wanted to persuade him to surrender, but Tianxiang was full of pride, unyielding and unbowed, willing to die quickly and exhaust his loyalty. Boluo knew it was difficult to persuade him, so he had to imprison him in a jail for three long years. Later, on the day of his execution at the Caishi execution ground in the capital, he calmly met his death, and his name became fragrant.</p>

<h3>Newspaper Reading Threshold (Continued 1)</h3>
<p>— Tan Tian</p>
<p>How can one teach people? However, solving the newspaper reading threshold for people like the little old man does not depend on how refined one is. As long as one can roughly tell him how to identify news, utilize news, and choose news, that is enough. Why must one have deep and broad knowledge? Right, that's how I plan to talk to the little old man about the newspaper reading threshold.</p>
<p>Newspapers and News Little old man, listen to me. You should read the newspaper every day, right? Reading the newspaper can let you know about national affairs, can let you know about future fortunes and misfortunes, and can serve as a reference for your own actions. As the saying goes, "Scholars don't go out, but can know about the world." Don't you want to be a scholar? If you don't understand, it doesn't matter. We will take some time every day, meet a few people, in your attic, and we will all study it together. It's not me bragging, there is a white louse on the newspaper, I know it has a leg. No matter what news agency, no matter how much they brag, I can find out its fox tail. Listen to me, every night, we will study. Now I will first tell you some Shanhaijing [Classic of Mountains and Seas] for you to listen to.</p>
<p>What is News</p>
<p>The two characters "news," in the eyes of the average person, are very familiar characters, but if you ask what the meaning of news actually is, I am afraid that few people know. It is said that ten years ago, the United States Congress offered a reward to solicit a definition of news. The first place winner's definition of news was quite detailed. He said, "News is a commodity, distributed by newspapers, for people who can read to consume." This statement is naturally the statement of a capitalist society, but in a socialist society, the statement is different. Take the current Soviet Union, for example. Their definition is, "News is a weapon of agitation, propaganda, and organization. Newspapers like Pravda and Trud newspaper uphold their own class, and expose the improprieties of society, not a commodity." From this, we can clearly understand the "meaning of news." It changes with the transformation of the times, environment, and social system. To be honest, under certain conditions, news is the only weapon of a country's government to lead the people, inspire the people, educate the people, and unite the people to attack the other side.</p>
<p>The Function of Newspapers The most fashionable saying now is, "Newspapers are the mouthpiece of the people, the public opinion of society." We believe that this statement can only be said in certain eras. Now we can only say in general, "Newspapers are a tool for transmitting news. Newspapers and news both change with the changes of the times and social and political systems. There is nothing fixed and unchanging in the world." We must be clearly aware of this point at all times. Here, we might as well mention the function of newspapers in passing. For example, changes in the weather, movements of personnel, newspapers record these things every day. If people who don't read the newspaper go to transport goods and do business, they will not know the weather, nor the market. If there is banditry in a certain place, it will be published in the newspaper early. If you don't read the newspaper and go there rashly, wouldn't it be extremely dangerous? Also, there are many refugees in Shanghai now. Some of them are caused by the war in Shanghai, and some are caused by the war in the interior. If newspapers had not first advocated for disaster relief, wouldn't the refugees have starved to death? In addition, international events also often affect our lives. People who know the world situation have methods to prepare and cope. A person who doesn't read the newspaper, no matter what, will suffer. People who don't read the newspaper live a muddled life, and everything goes wrong.</p>
<p>Newspaper Policy</p>
<p>It is said that in the past, the Roman Emperor Alexander IV, in order to prevent religions different from the Roman Church from invading, issued a decree banning illegal printed matter. At that time, he regarded the speech of different religions as illegal. Later, this method spread to various countries, and was increasingly expanded to suppress all other anti-state, diplomatic, military, political, and economic speeches and publications. Now it has become a general law for governments to block speech and publication. It limits the news of newspapers, allowing only news that is beneficial to the government. All opposing news, or news containing illegal elements, are restricted. This is called newspaper policy. Its method of restriction is to censor news. Usually, when we see a large section suddenly empty in the newspaper (commonly known as "opening a window"), that is an example of it. But speaking to this point, some people may ask, "Since this is the case, what is the point of newspapers?" It is not said that way. Within a certain range, newspapers still have the value of transmitting news, but they cannot record everything that is heard. However, people who have the ability to distinguish news can still see the words beyond the news.</p>
<p>Newspaper Extras</p>
<p>The two characters "extra," at a glance, you can know that it is not a normal newspaper. It is a small newspaper, issued when the situation is tense, and there is a special change, and the newspaper office does not have time to wait until the next morning to publish it. For example, when the Chinese army recaptured Guangzhou, as soon as the telegram arrived in Shanghai, an extra was immediately printed and published. But this is only limited to the surrounding area where the newspaper is located. More distant towns and cities still have to wait until the next day's first news to see it, but it is a little later. Newspaper Supplements A newspaper supplement occupies half a page or a full page of the newspaper. The content published on it is not news at all, but some texts related to history, geography, literature, common sense, etc. This is to adjust the readers' appetite, and satisfy the location of knowledge. Therefore, some people say that newspapers are a treasure trove of human knowledge. That's what it means. In addition, there are more special supplements. But the content is similar to the supplement, but with some temporary nature.</p>
<p>Special Articles and Commentaries</p>
<p>Newspapers often have a single article, either by a famous person or by an expert, which is marked with the words "special article" to show the difference. This kind of text is for readers to study and refer to. Its position is mostly in a corner of the news, and it is not published on a regular basis. As for commentaries, they are published every day. Its remarks must represent the newspaper's position, and its subject matter must be related to the important news of the time. Therefore, commentaries are more noticed by readers. Because it can not only point out the changes and causes of facts, but also point out the ways to solve the facts. It can create the foundation of public opinion.</p>
<h3>Jenner, the Inventor of Vaccination</h3>
<p>— Yi of Jenner</p>
<p>Whenever smallpox (commonly known as Tianhua) is mentioned, everyone knows that it is a very terrible infectious disease. Before the invention of vaccination, how many people died of this disease or became pockmarked every year is unknown. Naturally, after the invention of vaccination, mankind had a way to prevent and avoid contracting smallpox.</p>
<p>The earliest invention of vaccination should be attributed to our China. Our country invented vaccination in the Song Dynasty to prevent smallpox. However, because the method was too troublesome and the reaction was too severe, after the Western cowpox technique was introduced into China, our country's inherent method was no longer adopted by the medical community.</p>
<p>I think our readers have probably all been vaccinated with cowpox. After being vaccinated with cowpox, we are immune to smallpox. If we get vaccinated once every three years, then we will not be infected. Today we are going to talk about this savior who invented vaccination!</p>
<p>Before the invention of vaccination, smallpox was also common in various parts of England. At that time, an Englishman, Mr. Jenner, saw that the cows in the Glancestershire area also often suffered from cowpox, but their cowpox was different from that of us humans, limited only to a part of the body and not spreading to the whole body. Cowpox in cows mostly occurs in their udders, so many women who milk cows often get a few cowpoxes because the skin on their hands is injured, and the wounds are infected with the pus from the cow's pox, but the symptoms are very mild and do not spread to the whole body, and it is said that those women who have contracted cowpox will not get smallpox much in the future.</p>
<p>While hating the harm of smallpox to humans, Jenner personally saw and heard these strange facts. He thought: This is a truly amazing discovery. Why don't I study a method to prevent smallpox from this strange phenomenon?</p>
<p>Jenner finally decided to use his own beloved son as a test product, taking the concentrated juice from the cow's milk (nipple) that had smallpox and transplanting it into his beloved son's body. When he pierced his son's skin with a needle tip, his heart was cut like a knife, and his eyes were full of tears. He thought: If my son gets immunity from smallpox after vaccination, then people all over the world can be saved. This is such a great thing. If unfortunately it fails, then we should sacrifice for the sake of the world's people without regret. Finally, he decided to transplant the concentrated juice into the newly broken wound of his son. His son went through a day of pain, and as a result, only the transplanted part produced pus, forming a smallpox, which did not spread to the whole body. You can imagine how happy Jenner was.</p>
<p>After the results of this experiment, Jenner continued to study for many years before proving that humans who are vaccinated with cowpox can indeed gain immunity and will not be infected with human smallpox again. He published this painstaking research, but at first, the world did not deeply believe in cowpox vaccination. Later, because of the remarkable effect, it was valued by the world.</p>
<p>Now cowpox vaccination has spread all over the world, and almost all countries have laws that force people to be vaccinated. We can prevent the spread of smallpox by being vaccinated with cowpox.</p>
<p>Now is really the time to plant cowpox. If you have friends who have not been vaccinated, I hope you will go to get vaccinated quickly!</p>

<h3>Weekly War Report</h3>
<p>In the past week, there have been no large-scale battles on the northern and southern fronts. It is unknown whether the Japanese army is reorganizing and dispatching troops, but the Chinese army is taking advantage of the situation and making attrition contacts everywhere. Although no great achievements have been established, it also has considerable value, for example</p>
<p>North Jiangxi Front</p>
<p>The Japanese army operating in the Lushan area has been there for many days. After several contacts with the Chinese army, it seems to have lost its momentum. A unit of the Japanese army, under the cover of aircraft, advanced towards the Good Man Slope area again, attempting to seize Guling. The Chinese army fiercely countered, and the two sides launched a fierce battle. The accuracy of the Chinese artillery this time was beyond the Japanese army's expectations. As a result, the Japanese army had to retreat. The war in Duchang has not subsided. The Chinese army continued to make efforts to recover Jianghuo Mountain and encountered the Japanese troops on the lake surface south of the city. Both sides suffered damage. Another unit of the Japanese army fired artillery at the Chinese army on the north bank of the Xiushui River. The artillery was mostly tear gas, forcing the Chinese army to retreat. At night, more than four or five hundred Japanese infantrymen searched and advanced separately towards the vicinity of the Guanyin Pavilion in Shansha Duma Village, and were about to move towards Tujiapu. The Chinese army gave a head-on blow, and is now in a stalemate.</p>
<p>Shanxi Front</p>
<p>The Japanese army stationed in Fushan, Jinxi, has more than a thousand people. In the past few days, after continuous attacks by the Chinese army, they have suffered considerable losses, and most of them have moved westward. There are still more than 500 Japanese troops remaining in the city. The Chinese army divided its forces and besieged the city again the day before yesterday. After several hours of fighting, the Japanese army was unable to hold on and went to Linfen. Seeing that the Japanese army had left, the Chinese army recovered the county seat. In Anyi, Huoxian, Linjin and other places in southern Jin, there are frequent battles between the Chinese and Japanese sides, and in the battle of Linjin, a unit of the puppet army led by Su Chao, with a thousand men and complete weapons, suddenly took the opportunity to respond and rebel when the Chinese army was approaching, causing the Japanese army to be attacked from both sides and suffering extremely heavy losses. As for Huoxian, since it was recovered by the Chinese army, the Japanese army has launched a large-scale attack again. This time, the Japanese artillery fire was so fierce that it formed a fire net. The Chinese army fought back fiercely with a determination to die. The two sides' positions were in and out several times, and a stalemate was reached. Another unit of the Chinese army took the opportunity to counterattack Jingle, and the Japanese army felt it difficult to cope.</p>
<p>Guangdong Front</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Guangdong has been frequently deploying troops recently. On the one hand, it is stepping up the construction of defensive works, and on the other hand, it is rushing to build gun emplacements in various places on Hainan Island and Haikou. Now Wenchang, Ding'an, and Lishan have successively built airfields and warehouses, planning to use them as air force bases, which seems to have a long-term plan. As for sporadic battles, the Chinese and Japanese armies have fought fiercely in Shunde, Shengang, Ding'an, Wenchang, Huanshan and other places. The Japanese planes have carried out indiscriminate bombing, which has long aroused the resentment of the local people. Therefore, a large number of people have joined the army to fight bravely, which has been quite successful. Now the entire Japanese army is under the surveillance of the Chinese army, and any activity will be attacked.</p>
<p>Central Hubei Front</p>
<p>Since the fall of Zhongxiang in the war in central Hubei, the Japanese army has been actively repairing the Hanyi and Jingzhong highways, and rushing to build fortifications in Yangqing (ten kilometers east of Zhongxiang) and Pumenchong (twelve kilometers northwest of Yangzi) to consolidate its defense. Therefore, the war situation in that area has been quiet for the past week. The Japanese army in Duoerwan has been constantly shelling the opposite shore of Shayang, trying to test the Chinese army. However, the Chinese army also fired back, and the artillery hit the Japanese army's powder magazine, and the fire soared into the sky for a while, which could not be contained. In addition, the enemy at the Hongdongnan Port Ferry has been active on the west bank of the Xiang River, and has been surrounded by the Chinese army several times without success. The two sides are still fighting each other with artillery across the river. It is feared that it will be difficult for the Japanese army to cross the Xiang River.</p>

<h3>I am a Refugee</h3>
<p>— Refugee Reporter</p>
<p>I am a refugee!</p>
<p>Before I was a refugee, I was a good citizen, a "law-abiding" good citizen.</p>
<p>However, now I am a refugee! Now I am very aware: to be a citizen, it is not enough to just be law-abiding.</p>
<p>Being law-abiding is like powerless grass, and like sand scattered on the ground.</p>
<p>When the wind blows, the grass cannot but fall, and the sand cannot but be blown away.</p>
<p>So I have become a refugee, and I am very fortunate. Fortunately, I have gone through an ordeal. In the future, I will not only be a "law-abiding" good citizen.</p>
<p>I hope: in the future, I will plant myself into a tree with roots that cannot be blown down by the wind; I will condense myself into cohesive soil that cannot be blown away by the wind. Only in this way will I not have wasted the efforts of my compatriots who came to save me!</p>

<h3>Defend Nanchang</h3>
<p>— Maolie</p>
<p>The intermittent war of the past five months has now entered a fierce stage due to the enemy's attack on Nanchang. Of course, the enemy's intention is to interrupt the Zhejiang-Guangxi Railway, and to separate our Third War Zone and Ninth War Zone. In addition, it is to give its allies and its own people a kind of stimulation, indicating that they are still working hard to maintain their prestige, which is rapidly declining.</p>
<p>We will not discuss for the time being whether their Golden Plan can achieve its goal, but even if they really interrupt the Zhejiang-Guangxi Railway, and really excite their allies and their own people, what will they ultimately gain? Isn't it the same as before, with more consumption, which is exactly what we want! Our arrangements have long reached the point where we can fight each other and contact each other under any circumstances. They want to strike us militarily, which is completely wishful thinking. As for their allies, they have long seen their incompetence, and this kind of expression will not be effective at all, otherwise why would they use Qingdao and the Caroline Islands as bait to win them over with sweet words and generous gifts!</p>
<p>However, we must not reduce our defense of Nanchang for these reasons. On the contrary, we should take advantage of their exhausted strength and give them a severe blow to make them unable to recover. They have almost no troops left to be transferred domestically for this decisive attack, and they are pieced together from various places. After this final offensive is over, I can say that it is like a flash in the pan, shining for a moment, and then falling into darkness. We should seize this opportunity.</p>
<p>Their attack is still the old method: aiming at one place, transferring troops from various places to go there; aiming at one point, and rushing forward regardless of everything. Now the place they are aiming at is Nanchang, and the point they are aiming at is the key points between the Xiu River, Feng River, and Liao River. Then we can take this opportunity to counterattack the places where their troops are empty, and at the same time, like in Taierzhuang, give them individual encirclement and annihilation.</p>
<p>According to today's news, our "counterattack is in separate ways, and the situation has stabilized." Our goal of defending Nanchang can be achieved soon. I hope that our Nanchang, among the major cities, will always stand side by side with Changsha, as a mainstay on the Guangdong-Han and Zhejiang-Guangxi railways.</p>
<h3>Reply to a Japanese Poet</h3>
<p>— Written by Rabindranath Tagore, Translated by Zhefei</p>
<p>(Translator's Note: Although the title of this article is "Reply to a Japanese Poet," its content is essentially a general critique of the entire Japanese intellectual class.)</p>
<p>Your letter truly astonished me. Its content is so different from the Japanese spirit I understand, and my high regard for your work, as well as my personal relationship with you, were originally based on that spirit.</p>
<p>It is heartbreaking to think that the arrogance of Fascist militarism has even encroached upon the realm of creative artists, and that true intellectual power is willing to sacrifice its dignity and truth before the dark god of war.</p>
<p>Regarding Italy's Fascist massacre of Abyssinia, you seem to agree with me; but regarding the massacre of millions of Chinese people, you judge it from a different perspective. You protest that Japan is in a special position, but you forget that the same excuse is used in every war. Ardent warmongers always believe that their brutal acts are justified for a special reason.</p>
<p>You say that this method, "though terrible, is inevitable" and necessary for building a new world in Asia (in other words, indiscriminately bombing Chinese women and children, destroying their temples and universities—these are the only ways to preserve Asia's Chinese people).</p>
<p>The principle of "Asia for Asians," which you repeatedly praised in your letter, is filled with the worst characteristics of Europe, yet completely lacks the best virtues of human nature—the virtue of uniting people regardless of political divides.</p>
<p>When I read the recent speeches of Tokyo politicians, I couldn't help but laugh when they said, "The military alliance between Japan and Germany is built on spiritual and moral foundations and does not conceal external materialistic conditions." It is absurd that artists and thinkers also adopt this kind of sentimentalism that disguises military violence as spiritual might.</p>
<p>Even at the height of wartime frenzy, many great Western thinkers have shouted above the voices of the masses, challenging war profiteers in the name of humanity. Although persecuted, they would never sell the conscience of the people they represent. I believe there are also figures of this great spirit in Japan, but Japanese newspapers dare not mention them, because if they do not follow the will of the military leaders, their fate is destined to be diminished.</p>
<p>The betrayal of the intellectual class is one of the greatest dangerous symbols of our time.</p>
<p>You speak of the frugality of the poor people of Japan, their suffering and silent sacrifice, which makes you proud, but this kind of sad sacrifice is only for the sake of invading neighboring countries and bombing the homes of enemy people. I know that propaganda has now become an art, and non-democratic countries can hardly resist the temptation of this poison that increasingly corrodes them; however, I hope that the "intellectual class" can still maintain their independence. Unfortunately, the actual situation is far from it: behind many false arguments lies a stubborn nationalism, forcing today's "intellectual class" to exaggerate their "ideology" and use violent methods to force the masses toward death.</p>
<p>I know your people very well, so I don't believe they would deliberately participate in this kind of organized poisoning, dragging Chinese men and women into the sea of opium and heroin. Your people don't know about this, but Japanese colonists in China are engaged in this destructive undertaking on a large scale. There is already a lot of irrefutable evidence proving this fact, and no protest has been heard in Japan, not even from poets.</p>
<p>After assessing the thinking patterns of your intellectual class, I am no longer surprised by your government's permission for them to express their opinions "freely." I hope they can cherish their freedom!</p>
<p>Another symbol of the intellectual class's betrayal is their endorsement of the government's destruction of the foundations of the lives of neighboring peoples while enjoying preferential treatment from the government.</p>
<p>I know that one day the disillusionment of your people will come. At that time, they will understand that this reckless aggression against China is the destruction of the spirit of Japanese samurai, a destruction that is now proceeding with cruel brutality.</p>
<p>China is invincible! Her culture, under the protection of the brave General Chiang Kai-shek, is demonstrating its astonishing richness. Thanks to the loyalty of her people, an unprecedented unity is now seen, and a new era is beginning in China. Temporary defeats will never destroy her awakened soul.</p>
<p>Due to various disputes, China was often unprepared to cope with the huge trap of forced war, but now she has secured her position. Compared with Japan's military science—which is barbaric in nature and Western in style—China's attitude shows moral superiority.</p>
<p>You have not recognized that you are raising the status of your neighbor yourselves. But there are other considerations here. Madame Chiang Kai-shek said in "The Observer" that Japan is creating many "ghosts," destroying China's memorable works of art, destroying many irreplaceable Chinese academic institutions, and abusing peaceful societies.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang Kai-shek asked, "Who will eliminate those ghosts?"</p>
<p>We hope that in the near future, the people of China and Japan can join hands again and forget all the painful memories of the past. Only then can the true Asia be revived.</p>
<p>Japanese poets should raise their voices and unflinchingly affirm their faith in the future of mankind, in which the products of mutually destructive science will no longer have a place. (Translated from Europa Magazine)</p>
<h3>Repairing the Sheepfold After the Loss</h3>
<h3>Reading and Newspaper Insights (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Tu Lao</p>
<p>The Austrian philosopher Otto Weininger spent his life desperately attacking women. In his great work "Geschlecht und Charakter," he used various methods to prove that women cannot be equal to men, which was truly formidable. However, strangely, it is said that after writing this book, he became extremely depressed and soon committed suicide with a pistol.</p>
<p>Chinese Professor Liang XX once said: "The modern so-called movement for equality between men and women originated from the denial of the differences between men and women." This seems to be copied from the words of that Austrian philosopher. The professor also advocated: "Proper female education should be to make women complete women." This is even more thoroughly consistent with the philosopher's point of view.</p>
<p>Who says that what exists in foreign countries does not exist in China?</p>
<p>But the development of the two is different, but they are equally strange: that Austrian scholar looked down on women and only looked up to men, but in the end, he looked down on himself, who was indeed a man. This Chinese professor shouted that there should be differences between men and women, but during the national crisis, when he participated in the deliberation of national affairs, he advocated quickly "peace," obviously wanting all the men in the country, including himself (not to mention women), to become the women he idealized "without difference." ——It's really mysterious and inexplicable, making people dizzy!</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty, high-ranking officials who could meet the emperor, Manchus always called themselves "slaves," while Han Chinese could only call themselves "subjects." On the surface, "subject" seems to be more noble than "slave," but in fact, the opposite is true. "Slaves" were the emperor's confidants, while "subjects" still had to look at the "slaves." That is to say, "slaves" were one level higher than "subjects."</p>
<p>But did high-ranking officials who were Han Chinese at the time feel a little uncomfortable? I think there would be. Finally, I found materials that revealed this information.</p>
<p>In the eleventh month of the thirty-eighth year of Qianlong, the emperor commented: "...In the past, memorials were written by Manchu officials who always called themselves 'slaves,' while Han officials always called themselves 'subjects.' This is just an old example passed down,... It is not the case that calling oneself a 'slave' means being close and respectful, and calling oneself a 'subject' means being estranged and rude... In the future, all Manchu and Han officials, whether internal or external, should all call themselves 'subjects' to show uniformity. This is hereby ordered."</p>
<p>This is clearly an explanation to the Han officials, telling you not to be jealous. However, being a "slave" is still not possible, and you can only be a subject.</p>
<p>But this imperial edict is still just deceiving people. We only need to check the memorials of Manchu and Han ministers later to understand. For a period of time in the middle, perhaps everyone was really a "subject," but later, until the end of the Qing Dynasty, Manchu ministers were still "slaves," while Han ministers were always subjects.</p>
<p>Myself, son, grandson, great-grandson, great-great-grandson...kneeling down to my great Qing Dynasty for more than two hundred years, but in the end, I am still "wanting to be a slave but unable to be." Alas!</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>The agreed day arrived, and Chen, the town chief, felt as if seventeen or eighteen little deer were jumping around in his heart. The wedding time was set for 2 p.m., but the carnival began at noon. In the township office, the banquet stretched from the auditorium to the innermost courtyard. All the puppet soldiers of the X army were invited to the banquet, and everyone was allowed to drink without limit. The table in the center of the auditorium was particularly sumptuous, and it was set up by Town Chief Chen specifically to entertain the X army officers, the leader of the pacification team, and One-Eyed Li. He did not invite other guests to accompany them, because this table of wine was no different from death-summoning wine, and he could not bear to harm innocent people.</p>
<p>Before the banquet even began, Town Chief Chen had already entrusted the arsenic he had to Old Wang, a trusted handyman, instructing him to dissolve it in the wine jugs. He told him to make a secret mark on the wine jugs to indicate which one contained poison and which one did not. This was because he still harbored the idea of "preserving the whole," wanting to use the poisoned wine to poison those heinous villains while preserving himself with the non-poisoned wine.</p>
<p>At noon, the township office was already filled with people, and the sounds of laughter and chatter swelled until the room could no longer contain them. The pacification team leader was particularly happy because today was his wedding day, almost to the point of losing himself in delight. He kept stroking the little mustache above his philtrum with his hand. Only Town Chief Chen was an exception at the banquet. There was no joy in his heart, only bitterness and confusion. However, in order to avoid being seen through, he had to force a smile. After all, when something is on one's mind, even a forced smile will always seem unnatural from the outside.</p>
<p>After everyone was seated, Old Wang, the handyman, brought two jugs of wine to Town Chief Chen. Having received instructions from Town Chief Chen, he had already made secret marks on the wine jugs. The lid of the non-poisonous jug had a small piece of red paper glued to it. No one but Town Chief Chen noticed it. Town Chief Chen was meticulous in his haste. He knew that pure silver cups and chopsticks would turn black if they came into contact with poison, so he had already put them away and replaced them with glass cups and ebony chopsticks. He stood up, ready to pour wine for everyone, when One-Eyed Li suddenly reached out to snatch his wine jug and said:</p>
<p>"Today you are the father-in-law, you should sit comfortably. Let me do the job of toasting."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? Today you are the guests, and I am the host. How can there be a reason to reverse the roles of guest and host?" Town Chief Chen said stubbornly, refusing.</p>
<p>In fact, if Town Chief Chen had let One-Eyed Li do the toasting, he might have been able to protect himself, because One-Eyed Li did not know that there was poison in the wine. Even if he toasted the guests with the non-poisonous wine first, Town Chief Chen could have made an excuse not to drink when it was time to toast with the poisonous wine. However, he feared that One-Eyed Li would see through the plot, so he insisted on toasting the wine himself. He was also eager to succeed. He started by toasting the guests with the poisonous wine. At the same time, because he had never done this kind of thing before, he was inevitably a little timid. When toasting, he held the wine jug and shook uncontrollably, which aroused One-Eyed Li's suspicion. One-Eyed Li saw that Town Chief Chen had toasted everyone's wine, and there was still a lot of wine left in the jug, so he switched the wine jug to pour wine for himself. This made his suspicion even greater. Therefore, just as Town Chief Chen raised his glass to encourage everyone to drink, he suddenly shouted: "Wait!" and took a glass of wine from in front of him and gave it to Town Chief Chen, saying: (43)</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Telecommunications Industry</h3>
<p>— Fang Ziwei</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>Shanghai, being China's largest city, also boasts the most developed telecommunications industry. The scope of what is considered "telecommunications" is quite broad. Generally, it can be divided into wired and wireless telecommunications. Any use of radio waves to transmit text, signals, speech, sounds, images, and projections is collectively termed "wireless telecommunications." In China, the establishment of wireless telecommunications began in the 31st year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign when the Navy Ministry installed Marconi-type wireless telegraphs on the warships Hai Rong, Hai Chen, Hai Qi, and Hai Chou. The Army also set up military radio stations in Tianjin, Baoding, and Nanyuan. According to the Telecommunications Regulations promulgated in August of the 18th year of the Republic, China's wireless communications, except for those used by the Army, Navy, and Air Force, are managed by the Ministry of Communications. Due to space limitations, this article will only discuss wireless telecommunications. Shanghai established its first radio station in the 34th year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign, and it has made significant progress over the past thirty-odd years. Before August 13th, domestic communications could reach the border provinces and cities, and international communications extended to Europe, America, Africa, and other countries. Direct wireless telephone connections existed with Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, France, Italy, and other countries, with a very developed business. Various other radio stations served specific purposes for sea, land, and air communications. The following aspects will be discussed separately.</p>
<p>(1) Telegraph Bureau Radio Stations: China has been establishing wireless communications for thirty-three years. In the era of long waves, there were few radio stations, and the results were not significant. After the 15th year of the Republic, short waves flourished, and the results were greatly improved. However, there were times when there were two sides in wireless communications, which, due to business relationships and the negotiations between the Ministry of Communications and the Construction Commission, caused various disputes. This was a phenomenon that should not have existed in a country's telecommunications administration; however, the competition between them led them to seek improvements. On April 1st of the 23rd year of the Republic, the Ministry of Communications ordered the merger of all wireless communications in the country. Shanghai established the Wireless Communications Headquarters on Min Guo Road at the Lao Bei Men (Old North Gate). The transmitters had power levels of 15, 100, 100, 250, and 500 watts, using wavelengths from 25 meters to 105 meters. There were a total of seventeen lines communicating with important cities across the country, reaching as far as Dihua in Xinjiang and Lhasa in Tibet. Wireless telephone connections were also established with Hankou and Guangzhou. The telegraph types included ordinary and urgent telegrams, as well as newly opened services, meteorological information, and congratulatory messages, all with categorized pricing methods for the convenience of the public.</p>
<p>(2) International Radio Stations: Among the radio stations established in Shanghai, the earliest with international characteristics were the XSG radio station of the Wusong Wireless Telegraph Bureau and the XSH radio station of the Shanghai Wireless Line Station, as these two stations were the first to communicate with ships from various countries at sea. In October of the 17th year of the Republic, the National Government's Construction Commission purchased international main station equipment from the German Telefunken Wireless Company, ordered Sino-American radio station equipment from the American RCA, and purchased Sino-French radio station equipment from the French Long Distance Telephone Company. The transmitting station was located in Zhenru, Shanghai, the receiving station in Liuhang Town in Baoshan County, and the central receiving and transmitting office in the Sassoon House on Renji Road. An international branch station was built at Fenglin Bridge, initially communicating with the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Java. After the Ministry of Communications took over in August of the 18th year, it actively proceeded. Over the years, it successively (see separate table) communicated telegrams and telephones with countries on all continents, with a total of thirteen lines (see separate table). The types of communications included (1) ordinary, (2) urgent, (3) news, (4) official, (5) congratulatory, (6) letters, and (7) meteorological information. After the 19th year, business flourished. The average monthly income was 150,000 in the 21st year, 330,000 in the 23rd year, and the annual income was 6.49 million in the 24th year, reaching 7.96 million in the 25th year. International wireless communication has a close relationship with increasing mutual understanding and developing commerce between countries. This can be seen from the aforementioned figures.</p>
<p>(3) Coastal Radio Stations: Coastal radio stations are dedicated to communicating with ships at sea. The existence of coastal radio stations in Shanghai originated from the XSG radio station of the Wusong Wireless Telegraph Bureau and the XH radio station of Shanghai. The Wusong radio station was established in the 34th year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign, initially located at the Lion Ridge of Fengxian County, simultaneously with the radio station on Chongming Island. The reason for its establishment was that the sea line between Shanghai and Chongming was broken, and it was used to transmit official and commercial telegrams. In the first year of the Xuantong Emperor's reign, a British businessman set up a radio station in the Astor House hotel to communicate with ships at sea. Jiang Zunqi, the Director of the Postal Department at the time, negotiated with the British Minister Aitken and recovered it for the Chinese government to operate independently, attached to the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau on Simalu (now Central China Road). In the early years of the Republic, during the early stages of the European War in the third year of the Republic, the French built a radio station FZ in the French military camp in Gujiazhai and registered it with the Benoist Society, openly receiving and sending commercial telegrams and ship telegrams, with a monthly income of about 5,000 yuan. In the fourth year of the Republic, the Ministry of Communications purchased a 5-kilowatt spark gap transmitter from the German Siemens Company and began communicating with Chinese and foreign ships. In the 18th year, due to the development of business, a new 5-kilowatt vacuum tube transmitter and new receiver from Telefunken were added. Except for the Shanghai radio station XSH, which was dismantled, the station was destroyed in the battle on January 28th. Later, the Ministry of Communications contracted with the American Dahlberg Corporation to build a new station in Hongqiao. From then on, it became a purely coastal radio station, dedicated to ship communications. After August 13th, it moved to Guangdong Road. The station is related to the safety of life and property at sea, and the convenience of merchants. After the world wireless inventor Marconi came to China in the 22nd year, he sent a telegram to fourteen scientific organizations in Shanghai via the Italian Conte Rosso on his way back to his country, which was transmitted by this station.</p>
<p>(4) Ship Radio Stations: The earliest Chinese ships to install wireless telegraphs were the Hua Jia and Hua Yi. After the Ministry of Communications ordered that ships exceeding 500 tons should be equipped with wireless telegraphs, Chinese merchant ships have successively complied with the order. Shanghai's commerce is developed, and the number of ships entering and leaving the port is large. Ship radio stations are mobile in nature and are managed by the Telegraph Bureau under the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>(5) Dedicated Radio Stations: Dedicated radio stations are those set up by various special agencies and large enterprises with government approval, solely for their own business communications. Among the dedicated radio stations in Shanghai, apart from the Army and Navy, the earliest were the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Central Bank in the 17th year of the Republic. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's main station was located within the company's address on the Bund on Simalu, communicating with the Nanjing branch station and the radio stations on various ships of the company. The Central Bank's main station was located in its office on Jiujiang Road, communicating with Central Banks in various locations. After the 18th year, the Ministry of Finance's station in Shanghai, located within the Central Bank, was established, followed by the China National Aviation Corporation and Eurasia Aviation Corporation radio stations, which were established at Hongqiao Airport and Longhua Airport, communicating with Nanjing, Beiping, Xi'an, Hankou, Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and other airport stations, as well as with all thirty-plus aircraft of the two companies. The Jianghai Customs set up a radio station in Hongkou, communicating with customs offices along the coast and their patrol ships. The Dredging Bureau set up a radio station in Dinghaizhou, communicating with dredging ships at the mouth of the Yangtze River. The Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Bureau also set up its own radio station to communicate with major stations along the line.</p>
<p>(6) Broadcasting Stations: Shanghai had broadcasting stations as early as the 13th year of the Republic. At that time, the Wing On Company set up a station on the rooftop garden of its company on Nanjing Road, but it was ordered to stop by the Ministry of Communications. Subsequently, the American Carlow Company set up a 250-watt window station on Fuxing Road. After the 19th year of the Republic, many private individuals and groups in China and abroad established stations, reaching more than fifty. Unfortunately, the local authorities lacked adequate management, resulting in simple equipment and poor quality, and interference was the most serious problem. In November of the 20th year of the Republic, the Ministry of Communications reviewed and cracked down, allocated frequencies, and imposed restrictions, leaving only about twenty stations. In the 23rd year, the Ministry of Communications built the Shanghai Broadcasting Station to lead the way. In the 25th year, the municipal government also set up a broadcasting station in the city center. From then on, Shanghai had thirty-three public and private broadcasting stations, with power ranging from 15 watts to 30, 50, 100, 200, 250, and 500 watts, using frequencies from 570 to 1480 kilocycles, making it the city with the most broadcasting stations in the country.</p>
<p>(7) Meteorological Radio Stations: Father Froc, of the Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory, had receiving equipment as early as the first year of the Republic, specifically for receiving time signals reported by major European and American radio stations. In the third year of the Republic, the French station FFZ was established, and the daily weather reports from the observatory's meteorological station were broadcast by the station. The times were 11:55 am and 4:55 pm, day after day, benefiting sailing ships. In the 13th year, the Wusong coastal radio station XSG also began broadcasting weather information. After the 17th year, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company radio station and the Navy's Coastal Patrol Department radio station also successively broadcast weather information at set times. In April of the 22nd year, for the convenience of ships, the Jianghai Customs set up radio beacon stations at the Liujiaoshan, Huaniaodao, and Sheshan lighthouses, broadcasting weather conditions and issuing storm and fog warnings at set times to allow ships to prepare, with a wavelength of 1000 meters.</p>
<p>(8) Amateur Radio Stations: Amateur radio stations are established by those who study wireless communications as a hobby. The earliest amateur researcher in Shanghai was a student from Nanyang University in the early years of the Republic. Later, more and more Chinese people studied it. In the 18th year of the Republic, there was an organization called the China Amateur Wireless Radio Society, with more than 300 members and more than 30 amateur radio stations. At the same time, foreigners in Shanghai also had an organization called the International Amateur Wireless Radio Association, with dozens of members and more than 20 amateur radio stations. These amateur radio stations communicated with amateur enthusiasts around the world from time to time. During the January 28th and August 13th battles, they provided Shanghai news to the world and were well-known.</p>
<p>(9) Telecommunications Education: Telecommunications education is the driving force behind the telecommunications industry. The earliest public telecommunications education institution in China was the Telegraph Training Institute of the Ministry of Posts and Communications. After the Republic, it was renamed the Telecommunications School, located at Wangjia Wharf in Nanshi. Unfortunately, it was closed in the 23rd year, with a history of more than fifty years. Most of the past telecommunications talents came from the school. Other notable institutions included the Wireless Radio Training Institute of the Construction Committee in the 18th year of the Republic, which also produced many talents. Among the private institutions, the earliest was the China Wireless Radio Engineering School, which was established in the 13th year of the Republic and registered with the Ministry of Communications. Over the past ten years, it has graduated thousands of students, who are now serving in public and private organizations in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and government. After the 18th year, there were private institutions such as Zhonghua, Jiaotong, Nanyang, Sanguo, and Jianhua, but they were all interrupted or closed down. Many people also came from these institutions, and their achievements were remarkable.</p>
<p>(10) Telecommunications Machinery: The machinery required for the telecommunications industry was initially purchased from foreign countries, which was very expensive. Later, the Ministry of Communications established a telegraph machine repair shop in Shanghai, and later the Postal and Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Plant. In the 17th year, the Construction Committee established a wireless radio mold manufacturing plant within Jiaotong University, which was later renamed the Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Plant and located in Nanshi. Unfortunately, they were closed down one after another. In addition, there were private companies such as Dahua Scientific Instrument Company, Dahua Wireless Radio Company, Lida Company, and Asia Company. Over the past ten years, they have also produced a lot of products. Judging from the past situation of Shanghai's telecommunications machinery manufacturing industry, it is a very promising industry in the future.</p>
<p>The situation in Shanghai is special, and the telecommunications industry is therefore complex and difficult. In the past twenty years, it has gradually moved towards the right track. Unfortunately, after August 13th, it became chaotic and changed abnormally. This article only describes the situation before the war; and it does not mention the radio stations set up by foreigners and the navies and armies of various countries. Readers should pay attention to this.</p>

<h3>Overview of the Taxi Industry in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Pei Tang</p>
<p>Shanghai is the leading port in East Asia, with a dense population and thriving commerce, comparable to major cities worldwide. Not only do Chinese people gather here, but also Europeans and Americans come to reside for business. Because of the frequent interaction with Europeans and Americans, and living in close proximity, customs and habits have gradually become Westernized. The Western mode of transportation – the automobile – appeared at this time, and Shanghai began to establish a taxi industry. By the time the Republic of China was established, Shanghai's commerce had become even more prosperous, and the demand for transportation increased. Taxis emerged in response to the times, becoming one of the four essential elements supplying society. I, therefore, based on what I can recall, draft this article, "Overview of the Taxi Industry in Shanghai," to provide the public with some light reading after tea and wine.</p>
<p>The Founding Period: The existence of taxis in Shanghai actually began in the first year of the Republic (1911). The vehicles used at that time were all "covered carriages" (later called "carriages with hoods"). They had oil lamps in the front and rear and no bumpers. The water tank was covered with copper, in a rectangular shape. The handbrake was installed on the running board outside the car body. If it rained, there was no windshield wiper; only a little soap was applied to the windshield glass (insurance glass had not yet been invented) to prevent rain from sticking. Even the tires were very different from today's. The wheels were generally made of wood, and the rubber tires were smooth and without treads. The engine had to be started by hand. The car body was not as spacious and comfortable as it is today. As for small seats, handles, and other equipment inside the car, they were not worth mentioning. Everything felt simple and crude. From this, we can see the general situation of the vehicles at that time. The earliest operators were the Pingqia Men Automobile Company near Nanjing Road and Lloyd Road, and the Shimao Automobile Company near Nicheng Bridge, which can be said to be the pioneers of taxis in Shanghai. The fixed fare was five yuan for one hour and two yuan for half an hour. However, at the beginning of operations, there was little profit. Because the public did not recognize it as a convenient means of transportation, many people criticized it, considering it a gaudy luxury. Most people did not dare to ask about it. Only during holidays, some wealthy children and people in the entertainment industry would use it. However, most members of society still did not dare to try it. Around the second and third years of the Republic, the Feilong and Yitai Taxi Companies appeared. Afterwards, several companies such as Dongfang, Zhongyang, Feixing, and Yichang all operated taxis while selling cars. At that time, the price of gasoline was about eight or nine cents per gallon, and the most popular cars were Overland, Dodge, Ford, Studebaker, and other brands. However, the car rental was not uniform at the time. Some were calculated based on time (such as five yuan per hour, two yuan per half hour), while others were calculated based on the number of trips. For example, to Beixinjing, Longhua, Jiangwan, and other places, the car rental was no less than five silver dollars. Therefore, the failure of taxis to serve all sectors of society was mainly due to its high cost.</p>
<p>The Golden Age: In the eighth year of the Republic, the taxi industry suddenly boomed. Major car companies such as Yunfei, Huanqiu, Tanle, and Lili rose one after another, renewing the situation. Small car companies with only a few cars sprang up like bamboo shoots after rain. At the same time, in order to meet the needs of various sectors of society, major car companies added branch stations in residential and commercial areas and set up calling points in major companies, shops, and entertainment venues to expand business. The car rental also became unified, changing to three yuan per hour and one yuan per twenty minutes. The successful construction of roads around Shanghai and the expansion of the car companies' scope helped the development of the taxi industry. By this time, members of society had changed their past views and began to recognize taxis as the only convenient means of transportation.</p>
<p>Around the 16th year of the Republic, the municipal authorities, in view of the frequent traffic of taxis in the city and their close relationship with society, paid attention to it and specially formulated new regulations for management. For example, vehicles operating in the old city area were required to donate an additional vehicle license fee, and the vehicle licenses of all taxis were uniformly changed to white plates with black characters for identification. In order to eliminate the abuse of arbitrary substitution of vehicle licenses donated each time, a small photo was installed on the car door for prevention. The weight of the vehicle was also measured when each vehicle license was donated, to determine the amount of the vehicle donation. It was also ordered that each car be equipped with two horns with different sounds, to warn pedestrians for safety, and a rear-view mirror was added in front of the driver's seat to check for obstacles behind the car when reversing. All these measures were taken by the municipal authorities at the time to improve the vehicle operations of various car companies. At that time, due to social demand and the drop in gasoline prices to fifty-seven cents per gallon, the business of all car companies was booming. New car companies such as Yuegong, Nanfang, Xiangsheng, Huangqiche, and Huabei took the opportunity to establish themselves. This can be said to be the golden age of the taxi industry in Shanghai since its inception.</p>
<p>The Period of Decline: After the "January 28th" incident, the taxi industry fell sharply. Gasoline prices rose to about one yuan. Many of the smaller car companies could not maintain their operations due to heavy losses and closed down. Even the larger car companies showed signs of shaking. This can be said to be the period of decline of the taxi industry in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Recent Period: In recent years, due to the consolidation of the legal tender system, all industries have gradually prospered, and the taxi industry has seen a revival. Yunfei, Xiangsheng, and Tailai are the largest and most well-organized car companies. In the 24th year of the Republic, the largest post-war car company, Silver Car Company, was established, making it the four major taxi companies in Shanghai. In recent years, the equipment and management of various car companies have been more thorough than in the past. To ensure customer safety, in addition to inspecting all vehicles every week, they also have car insurance to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>In the summer of the 26th year, a small taxi run by French businessmen appeared in the Second Special District of Shanghai, which initially charged car rentals based on the distance traveled. However, due to the failure to meet customer needs, it was voluntarily closed down soon after.</p>
<p>After "August 13th," traffic around Shanghai was cut off, and the routes were shortened considerably. Due to the high exchange rate, the price of gasoline soared to one yuan and four cents per gallon. The prices of tires and car parts also rose several times. The price of new cars also doubled, from about two or three thousand yuan each in the 14th and 15th years of the Republic to no less than six or seven thousand yuan now. For this reason, in order to maintain costs, various taxi companies unanimously agreed to raise prices by 20% on August 1st of the 27th year. Therefore, the current car rental has been set at one yuan and one cent per twenty minutes, and three yuan and six cents per hour.</p>

<h3>Chamberlain Dance</h3>
<p>— Ge Er</p>
<p>Chamberlain is the Prime Minister of England, and the "Chamberlain Dance" is a kind of "dance art" that has recently become popular in the French dance scene. It is said that this "Chamberlain Dance" is as sensational as the "Lambeth Walk" currently popular in Shanghai's dance halls, and people are vying to imitate it.</p>
<p>The reason why the French dance scene has the "invention" of the "Chamberlain Dance" is because this Mr. Chamberlain, who is the Prime Minister of England, likes to carry an umbrella when he goes out, and he is also very fond of "world peace," so he is supported by the general public who "oppose war."</p>
<p>The "people" who "oppose war" mentioned above are completely different from the "opposition to war" of the people who hold parades and demonstrations in anti-fascist China, the United States, France, and other countries. The former's "opposition to war" is because it can maintain their life of "enjoyment and indulgence." "Dance halls" are of course one of the best places for them to "enjoy and indulge." Mr. Chamberlain's "love of peace" and maintaining "world peace" allow "war" not to "break out." The rich young men in the dance halls invented the "Chamberlain Dance" as a reward. This is truly the so-called "matter of course" and "unavoidable duty."</p>
<p>These are all "iron facts": Some time ago, after Head of State Hitler "reclaimed" Austria under a "referendum," he then used a set of "old formulas" to "reclaim" the Sudetenland. Miss France's eyes did emit a charmingly angry glow, as if she wanted to take off a dancing silk stocking and talk about a confrontation with Head of State Hitler. If it were not for the peace-loving Mr. Chamberlain "running around" and fulfilling the "great mission" of the "peace dove," then Miss France's "dancing silk stockings" would have already been taken off. However, wouldn't that make it impossible to "dance"?</p>
<p>Now, Head of State Hitler has even put Czech, which is not a Germanic race, under his "protection." Although the old Chamberlain loves "peace," "which is tolerable, and which is not tolerable?" Therefore, even the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a six-nation conference was considered "too slow to help" and "premature," and he did not agree with it. However, he thought that a widespread issuance of a "declaration" would be very "helpful." And today, even the "helpful" "declaration" does not need to be issued. Of course, according to the current situation, Head of State Hitler has already signed a "fair" "commercial agreement" with Romania. The "clouds of war" in Europe have "disappeared" again because Head of State Hitler has "known when to stop." Isn't the publication of the "declaration" "premature"?</p>
<p>"World peace" can be "maintained" again, and the "Chamberlain Dance" in the French dance scene should be danced even more "madly." This is enough to show a "peaceful atmosphere."</p>
<p>Now, I am introducing the "method" of the "Chamberlain Dance" below, providing a Macao for "dance friends" who "love peace": "After men and women start dancing in pairs, a male guest hangs an umbrella on his right arm. This male guest can choose any female guest he likes most from any pair dancing together, step forward to invite her to dance, and casually hook the umbrella on the right arm of the female guest's male partner. He can then dance wildly, regardless of whether the male partner is willing or not. However, the male guest who gets the umbrella can also act according to the law, so the cycle is endless, which is quite fortunate and interesting."</p>
<p>The "considerable interest" of the "Chamberlain Dance" is certain. Let us watch the popularity of this "Chamberlain Dance"! Of course, this requires closing your eyes and not looking at Head of State Hitler.</p>
<h3>New Trends at the Shanghai Drama Society</h3>
<p>— Zong Yi</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Drama Society has only held three public performances, each separated by three or four months. There are many reasons for this. However, among these reasons, external factors are the most significant. For example, the difficulty in renting theaters is a major obstacle to the future of the spoken drama movement. Last year, we rushed to perform "Tears on Flowers" during the closing of the Carlton Theatre. There simply isn't a suitable venue in the Public Concession for us to perform. Although the French Municipal Council Hall can be borrowed, preferential rental rates are only given for French plays. For Chinese or Anglo-American plays, the full rent must be paid, and the limited seating makes performing there uneconomical. But should we stop performing altogether due to the lack of a venue? Of course not! We must strive to continue securing performance venues, and we will continue rehearsing major plays. Currently in preparation are "The Way to Make a Fortune" and "Motherland," both of which are French plays. If we can't find a suitable major theater, we can still perform at the French Municipal Council Hall. However, we cannot allow the Drama Society's work to be delayed by three or four months again. We must continue performing swiftly, so we have decided to do Sunday morning public performances. We have also decided on more than a dozen short plays to be rehearsed consecutively. We have signed a four-month contract with the Xinguang Grand Theatre, where we will meet with Shanghai's spoken drama enthusiasts every Sunday. This is the first significance of our Sunday short play performances.</p>
<p>Sunday short play performances have had a history of over a year in Shanghai. Audiences find it very economical and appropriate to use the short time on this holiday. However, the general criticism of previous short play performances has been that they were hastily done and the results were not very good. We want to promote and improve the standard of performance. We are very strict in selecting plays, and we are as careful in selecting actors and directors as we are for major plays. After you have seen the programs, directors, and actor allocations for our first two performances, you will understand the second significance of our short play performances.</p>
<p>Many new people are constantly joining the Drama Society. We would like to give them some training, but we cannot do so due to time and economic constraints. We have decided to use the Sunday short play performances as a training model for new people. For our first few performances, the roles of director and actors will be filled by the senior talents of our society, who will demonstrate on stage as teaching materials for the newcomers. Later, we will gradually select from the new people to enrich our cast of actors. This is the third significance of our Sunday short play performances.</p>
<h3>After Watching "Trade Winds"</h3>
<p>— Ru Hua</p>
<p>"Trade Winds"</p>
<p>Produced by United Artists</p>
<p>"Trade Winds" is a comedy that combines romance and detective work, similar to Marlene Dietrich's "Desire." It depicts how a detective tracks a young, beautiful blonde woman who is a murderer. Because it is a comedy, of course, they "live happily ever after," and before the end, another murderer is found to make it "kill two birds with one stone." But after watching "Trade Winds," even with the lowest expectations, it falls short of "Desire." Indeed, "Desire" doesn't offer us much either. Here, the playwright reveals two shortcomings:</p>
<p>First, he tries his best to make the story lively. So, after the case occurs, he takes the blonde woman Kay (Joan Bennett), who is considered the murderer, from San Francisco to Honolulu, Osaka, Shanghai, Saigon, Singapore... and lets the detective Sam (Fredric March), who is ordered to catch her, follow her around in circles. This way of writing is lively, and it introduces the scenery of various places, giving the audience a novel feeling. However, the problem that arises at the same time is that many scenes become mere transitions, preventing the actors' emotions from developing uniformly.</p>
<p>Second, when introducing Sam, he is not a detective who uses love as bait for his professional duties, but rather a "master of flirting." So, it is possible for him to develop feelings for Kay. However, in the process between his request for a reward and his smugness after receiving it, he lacks a sense of being confident. This not only makes Sam's character somewhat erratic, but also makes the final solving of the case very abrupt. This may be the "deliberate mystification" of general detective films, but this "deliberate mystification" is "overreaching."</p>
<p>In terms of performance, Sam and Kay secretly get married in Bombay, and another detective comes to track them down. Kay is arrested. Here, the development of the play has reached its climax, and the final solving of the case is equally forced.</p>
<p>Director Tay Garnett is quite diligent. For example, when Sam is tracking Kay, the various scenes that represent local characteristics are connected very clearly. The arrangement of two comedic characters—Sam's female secretary Jean (Ann Sothern) and assistant Boloug (Ralph Bellamy)—is also very natural. Joan Bennett's acting has improved, and she is able to perform very movingly in many scenes. Fredric March has changed his previous style somewhat in "Smilin' Through," "There Goes My Heart," and this "Trade Winds." However, this change in style is not successful but rather a failure.</p>
<h3>China National Child Welfare Association</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Rescuing Countless Refugee Children During the War of Resistance</p>
<p>Not Only Sheltering Them But Also Educating Them</p>
<p>Children are the future masters of the country, especially China, which needs the talents of new people to shoulder the mission of post-war reconstruction work. Therefore, we should always pay attention to their health and not let their small lives be lost. Parents should be more careful in disciplining them. In our memory, regarding child welfare issues, there used to be a China National Child Welfare Association in Shanghai, which made considerable efforts in this regard, and many children received the benefits of the China National Child Welfare Association.</p>
<p>The China National Child Welfare Association's office, located at 131 Museum Road, was organized by Chinese and foreign individuals enthusiastic about child welfare issues. Kong Xiangxi, the President of the Executive Yuan, was the president of the association, and the vice presidents were Luo Yunyan and Mrs. Herman Krekeler. In addition, Mrs. Niu Huisheng, Ms. Wang Xiaoying, Li Ting'an, Li Denghui, Mrs. Franklin, Chen Heqin, Mrs. Yu Yongjian, Zhao Jinqing, Liu Wang Liming, and others were members of the China National Child Welfare Association. Such a charitable organization, with so many renowned figures supporting it, its development and benefiting children, can be imagined.</p>
<p>Before "August 13th," the China National Child Welfare Association had a wide range of activities: The Shanghai Child Welfare Training Institute on McCandless Road housed orphaned children without support and provided them with adequate education so that they could become independent and healthy citizens when they grew up. A children's hospital for the poor was established in Zhabei, where poor children could receive free medical treatment and medicine when they fell ill. To promote children's health, it organized children's health competitions every year in conjunction with various groups and health organizations. In terms of publications, there was a regular publication, the "Modern Parents" monthly magazine, which specialized in articles on parenting issues, instilling parental education so that general parents could pay attention to the importance of parenting and have sufficient new knowledge of parenting. There were many other tasks, but the author cannot remember them all at the moment and has to omit them.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, due to the bombing by Japanese aircraft everywhere, countless innocent children in the war zone lost their homes and were separated from their parents. Even more refugee children were scattered among the refugees and fled to the concessions. Therefore, the work of the China National Child Welfare Association became even more urgent. A refugee children's shelter was set up in the St. John's YMCA Middle School on Jessfield Road, not only sheltering refugee children but also educating them. Many refugee children's schools were established, and doctors from the Zhabei Poor Children's Hospital took turns to treat sick children in various shelters. A refugee children's hospital was also established on Rue Molière. The established Poor Children's Training Institute was also evacuated from Zhabei to the concessions and continued to work in the Wangjia Sha Garden on Carter Road. With such a wide range of work and such intensive work during the war, considerable funding was naturally required. All the association's funding was donated by enthusiastic members. After the war left Shanghai, most of the work of the China National Child Welfare Association in the concessions continued. Not long ago, they even made a large number of winter clothes and distributed them to refugee children. Even though the environment is like this, they are still so enthusiastic about child welfare, which is worthy of our admiration. However, the China National Child Welfare Association's office has recently moved to Chongqing. Only a branch office is set up in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The work of the China National Child Welfare Association in this war is not limited to Shanghai. Wherever there is a war zone or an important rear area, the association sends personnel to work on the ground, rescuing general homeless refugee children. Branches have been established as far as Lanzhou, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and other places, actively engaging in child welfare work. The number of children in the war zone who were rescued by the association and thus avoided death is countless!</p>

<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Praising an Old Man with Three Outstanding Offspring, Narrating Friendship with Two Heroes Meeting Elites</p>
<p>Because most of the children in this nursery are fostered by others, it is rare to have some who have no parents and are not claimed. Some have mothers who have died, and fathers who have other occupations and cannot raise children, so they entrust them to this nursery. Some have fathers who have died, and mothers who need to seek employment and cannot raise children, so they also entrust them here. There are also parents who are still alive, but there are too many children in the family to raise, like Officer Fang's triplets, who have to be sent here. There are also those who have lost both parents, or whose parents have "disappeared," and another third party sends them here. There are all kinds of children in various forms. However, those fostered in the nursery should usually be paid, otherwise, with these more than 300 infants, the expenses last year were really considerable. Who would pay these expenses? Moreover, parents who give birth to children should be responsible for their upbringing, which is the same in any system of country. However, there is another kind of children who have no parents, or whose parents have, but cannot raise them, and the country or local area establishes a kind of public children's home. After the war, we China also established a lot of them, with various names: some are called orphanages, some are called refugee children's training homes. These institutions are probably established by a group of philanthropists who see that the children are pitiful and make public donations. Later, they were all changed to public children's homes, which are assigned by the state to be established locally. Regardless of who their parents are, or where they are from, if they are Chinese, they are a part of the Chinese nation. These public children's homes are not related to the nursery run by Dr. Zhang Wenqi in Anle Town and others. Because the nursery run by Dr. Zhang and others, although it cannot be said to be aristocratic, has better equipment and better treatment. It is not a charitable nature, it is not a public institution. Zhu Airen led the two of them to say, "Our first step is to go and see the kindergarten." Then they came to the kindergarten. There were about 60 people who were eligible to enter the kindergarten. They were divided into four groups, each group with sixteen or seventeen people, the oldest being six years old and the youngest being four years old. Like Dr. Ye Chuqing's two children, they are all in it, the little brother is six years old, and the little sister is four years old. However, by next year, the little brother will be of primary school age, and another way has to be found. The kindergarten is named as a country, but it is a garden, and there are some trees. These trees are all hung with a wooden sign, on which is written what tree was planted on what day of what month of what year, and it is clearly stated who planted it. It is said that a kindergarten student, when they are about to leave the kindergarten to enter primary school, must plant a tree as a souvenir.</p>
