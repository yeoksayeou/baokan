<p>社評</p>
<h3>世界和平繫於德國</h3>
<p>德意志元首希特勒氏旣亡捷克，隔昨凱旋柏林；黨徒人民歡迎之者，舉國若在，上將戈林氏代表獻辭，有語云：「元首不特恢復日耳曼族歷史之尊榮，且措德國於磐石之安」。戈林氏者，德國四年經濟計劃之獨裁者，衆議院議長，航空部長，普魯士邦總督，蓋希特勒氏之唯一股肱，亦世人心頭眼底之希特勒繼承人也。以此人，對此事，作此頌，必句斟字酌，恰合分際，宜非無聊之諛詞；雖然，何以竟與舉世對德對希特勒氏之觀感，舉世對大局前途之戒懼，絕然相反？夫豈「子爲漢臣，安得不云爾乎」所可解釋？洵解釋而若是，則亦便佞之流，詎足以稱國士哉？</p>
<p>德之吞捷，舉世痛斥之日野蠻，曰暴行，日罪惡，曰食言背信；英美法俄吾認爲合法，以彰其非；英法更召回使節，以示不齒；此則日耳曼國族曠古未有之羞，夫尊榮之謂何？</p>
<p>當世民治之四强，旣發動制裁，競事備戰；合此英美俄法之軍事經濟力量，誰復足與抗衡？况彼波蘭希臘土耳其羅馬尼亞保加利亞南斯拉夫等東南六國，利害攸共，倡議合縱，衆志成城，多助自昌；蔚爲集體力量，儘足周旋於疆塲。此應爲德意志憂國之士所寢饋難安者也。更若美國副國務卿威爾斯氏，秉承總統，所發譴責德國之辭，以捷克之不幸爲暫時屈服；謂暫時，是謂倒挽在瀾之有道，暗示重整河山之前途。又若英國首相張伯倫氏，夙稱袒德，並世無兩之和平老人也；坦然自承爲被給，憤不可遏；在伯明罕城演說之際，斷言於德國多行不義，必自食其報；又斷言於他日德國人民，必集矢於其當局今日所播之惡果；此豈老人效村嫗而詛咒？宜有灼見眞知，宜必言之有物，蓋必有老謀勝算以繼其後者也。凡此所舉，具見德國樹敵已多，結怨已深，一朝發難，便陷重圍；是危如纍卵矣，夫安如磐石之謂何？</p>
<p>德國朝野其審知之乎：今日世界洶洶，輿情沸騰；憾德國者，幸災樂禍，忻然於德國卒遭衆棄，末運臨頭；愛德國者，疾首痛心，怛然於德國竟犯衆怒，刧運將至。吾人誠不知希特勒元首如何盤算？亦不知戈林上將究何所感而猶以尊榮自許？究何所恃而猶以磐安自豪？吾人殊未信德國獨智，舉世皆愚，智愚殊絕而致舉世莫測德國高深。然則德國固將何以善此洶洶之後乎？謂有恃無恐，是欺人自欺；德人誠有無恐之氣概，但氣概何足以却敵緩禍？吾人固深佩日耳曼民族者也，聰明强毅，洵爲寰宇優秀民族之一；歷來對於人文科學，貢獻尤多。我人亦深知德國有光榮之歷史，威廉一世之威風，依稀猶在目前，然自大戰失敗，國力疲敝，歷盡千辛萬苦，艱難締造而有近頃之復興；顧乃蔑視歷史之敎訓，蔑視人羣之信義，蔑視其他族類之生存，至今日而復成衆矢之的。二十年前之悲劇，行且復演於今茲；二十年來之心血，行且毀棄於一日；謂不可哀可惜耶！</p>
<p>大戰爆發之日，無論德國打一仗勝一仗，當者披靡，所向無敵，然絕無絲毫可得最後勝利之希望；蓋各個擊破之策略已經失效，而衆怒難犯，德國必無幸也。抑大勢所示，無論絕無一國一人，樂於世界大戰之竟爆發，然各國對德，屢謂隱忍有其限度，今以德之亡捷而衆口一辭於突破限度，不復能隱忍矣；懼德無饜之心理，制德自全之意念，普遍而深入矣；慕尼黑之和平騙局，不復容再度搬演，以求所謂苟且和平矣；和平老人怒矣，國際之反德陣綫幾乎繞德數匝矣；今日固已絕難發見一綫和平之希望矣。有之，其惟德國朝野，能瞻前顧後，審時度勢；以大智大勇，繫鈴解鈴。夫明知肇禍，何以不悔？悔禍於大禍將發未發之頃，是悔禍之最後機會。今日德國而能幡然改圖；而能於不復可以取信於世界之語言文字之外，本諸英雄本色，發揮運動家精神，收歛鋒芒，務尙謙抑，以光明之行動，修正事實，坦然轉變政策，限制擴展；與世界以共見共聞，則必爲世界所共信共諒而共慰；時至今日，德國固猶有此機會焉。抑維繫尊榮，蘄求磐安，殆亦僅此機會；機會不常，稍縱即逝，惟德國朝野圖之而已。</p>

<p>財相西門動議該議案二讀時宣稱、英國對華貿易之總額、在英國對世界貿易之總額中雖不佔高成效、但殊値得予以維持並援助、尤其因中國人口至衆、祇須每人稍增其購買、卽有至大之出入、目前之戰事發生後、中國於一九三五年開行之幣制、乃受嚴重之試騐、中國曾採行計劃周密之技術的方法、海外華僑亦紛以滙款捐款債款援助法幣去年法幣始終穩定、絕寡紛擾、或削弱信任、如下院贊助本議案、則敢保中國對於此事、决能保持其信譽與傳統也、</p>
<p>工黨議員勞倫斯即起稱、渠願贊助此案、因其中所規定者、足以促進英國貿易、尤其因此舉對中國奮鬥以抗日本可予以切實之援助、時機今或已到臨、政府當考慮能取其他行動、以增强華人之抗戰、及遏止日人企圖制人死命至何地步而後已、反對政府之目由黨議員曼德亦贊助議案、據稱、政府遵行此事所具之精神、太覺狹小、渠殊爲扼腕、渠意政府當擴大行動、以保英國貿易得自由入至世界該部分、政府今不過爲實行國聯之决議案而已、保守黨議員布特比起稱、渠所抱憾者、此種援助不早實現、且欠充厚、</p>
<p>工黨議員史密斯動議否决該案、謂苟非政府在遠東進行另一政治經濟政策、則絕難遏止法幣之漲落、政府因不開罪日本、而未倡首以人道之援助給予中國人民、實屬溺責、已往八年中、政府之政策輒以與侵略者有所勾結、以犧牲被害者爲務、工黨議員丁克贊助修正文、並謂政府今所爲者、爲當日本侵略中國時吾人未堅定立塲之結果、</p>

<p>工黨議員布爾克稱、保持棉業之任何讓步、縱屬微小、並輔助工方維持所已得之市塲、則工方將甚感謝、渠信日本之奮鬥、將於戰事終了後眞正開始、修正文如遭進迫、而至下院須分贊拒之點、則渠願投票以贊助政府之主張、工黨議員貝倫傑起稱、如此案之目的、乃在鼓勵中英貿易、則渠願予以贊同、至是財相西門揷言、此確爲本案之目的、於是貝氏詢問此項基金、日否將與美法兩國合作運用、如三國貨幣恊定之狀態、財相答稱、他國政府已以不同之方式、予中國以金融上之援助、例如美政府現正購入中國大批白銀是、惟就本建議而論、渠須請求下院予以接受、作爲吾人對中國之貢獻、</p>
<p>財政部財政司華萊斯答覆辯論、略謂反對黨發言人曾承認一千萬鎊已足敷此用、在辯論中並承認中國之法幣、目前並未搖動、且安穩已閱多時、而獲有內部甚佳之援助、華氏否認此項建議乃爲支持私人銀行而發之說、謂其所以與四家銀行聯合以管理此項基金者、實因如是則政府對於此事能運用大量之能力與經騐、而四家銀行亦以參與此舉爲大榮、政府在往日能否援助中國一節、姑置不問、然本案爲給予中國之顯明甚大之援助、則實毫無疑義也、渠希望下院一致通過本案、蓋此舉將於中國發生甚大之心理上的效果也、華氏次述及日本在華北實行之貨幣計劃、及英政府對於此項計劃之抗議、謂事之更可慰人者、爲最有資格之評論家皆認日本之計劃、實際必歸失敗、今如圖將法幣價格一先令六便士半、改爲一先令二便士、則立即發生之結果、似將爲出口貿易之停止、中國法幣除在若干城鎮及鐵路一帶日軍所控制者外、將照常繼續流通、至基金運用之地將爲香港、一千萬鎊即將募足、該基金所得之利金、將用以輔助中國銀行所應付英國銀行之利息、利率現商定爲二厘七五、如一年之後賡續恊定、利率或增或减、將視當時情形定之、至於案中未詳載向上之利率者、則因該恊定或將賡續若干年、及因吾人殊不欲時時返至下院請求核准也、（二十日路透電）</p>

<h3>日本南進政策中　太平洋之新形勢　民主集團受實促省已注力應付未來大戰　德日密約謀稱覇歐亞</h3>
<p>香港特約通訊，太平洋的風波，不是從今天開始的。在過去七八年間，中國首先充分做了遠東侵略者的羔羊，在抗戰中由羔羊而變爲猛虎，但是大國如英美法荷却始終苟安退讓，因之侵略國的勢力一天比一天膨大，太平洋的危機也一天比一天增進。現在侵略者的刀鋒，不單是對着中國，而且直同着太平洋一切和平國家了，英美法荷各國要苟安已無從苟安，要再向侵略者讓步，就是等於自殺。這是很容易明白的，日本在今日的唯一出路，就是只有南進，南進可以刺激國內民心掩護在中國作戰的失敗，可以威脅英美法荷攫取白種國家在遠東的殖民地，可以配合德意的嚇詐政策，貫徹反共集團的共同目的，除開南進之外，還有什麼路走呢？他因爲對中國作戰已到山窮水盡的僵局，所以不能不轉變政略戰略，由南守北攻而愛爲北守南攻，由親英反蘇，而變爲同時反英法蘇，換句話說：就是要由大陸進攻，變爲大陸與海軍雙方並進，這一新的政策，在决定之前，曾經過數度的試探，去年五月的厦門登陸，十月的廣州佔領，目的都在於試探英法方面起何種反嚮，結果剛和張鼓峯相反，英法方面熊度軟化，試探是僥倖成功了，於是到了去年十一月三日，近衛發表了建立「東亞新秩序」的宣言，接着海軍就陸續向華南集中，到了最近海南島的登陸，南進政策積極化，巳得到事實的證明。海南島登陸以後，日本立即進行在瓊崖建立海空軍根據地，並且由國內派遣專家赴海南視察，證明日本有永久佔領的企圖，同時日本又以空軍轟炸九龍新界的英國領土，日本海相米內，宣佈除前年開始的八萬萬日元造艦計劃繼續執行外，特於二月底向議會要求海軍造艦追加預算，以與英美競爭。</p>
<p>法報洩露德日密約</p>
<p>和這南進政策有密切有密切關係的，是德日兩國最近數月來秘密進行着的軍　談判。這是很明顯的，希特勒需要日本在遠東拖住英法的脚，也就像需要法西斯意大利在地中海捧住英法的頭一樣。只有這樣·德國才可以再向英法大大敲一筆竹槓，比在慕尼黑所敲更大的竹槓。不過德日兩個法西斯國家，幹的是什麼把戲，在目前是諱莫如深的。只有法國的週刋在一月二十五日透露上一點消息，據稱，德日兩國於去年十一月二十日，在東京簽訂了一個密的，其中規定：（一）日本倘因中國事件而牽入新的戰爭時，德國當以陸海空軍全力援助日本。（二）中國領土內，凡日木享有經濟特權時，德國亦享受同樣權利。德國並有權對於「新中國一政府派遣技術及軍事顧問。（三）庫頁烏及蘇聯遠東領土倘受日本管轄時，德國應獲得讓與權。（四）德國得恢復戰前在太平洋殖民地，但以不損害日本戰略安全爲條件，這是密的的第一部份。還有第二部份是規定瓜分馬來殖民地的，德國得佔有荷　新幾內亞，馬都拉島西部，西里伯島南部，荷屬西印度的蘇里南，還有英屬婆羅洲。但英屬馬來亞半島到新加坡爲止，暹羅及其餘荷屬東印度，都作爲日本的勢力範圍。這一個密的中間，並沒有說到菲律賓，夏威夷，越南，印度，緬甸的分割，據說是因爲要留着等待意國參加總日密的的時候好　新分配。送雖然是一個未經證實的報告，但是從七十四屆議會日外相有田再三主張强化反共恊定這一點，從德國準備於三月間向英法來一次要求殖民地的新威脅這一點，從英美法荷積極擴張遠東的軍備這一點，都可以看出德日瓜分太平洋殖民地道一消息，這不是完全沒有根據的。自然法西斯國家這一些挑釁行爲，在目前是出於恫嚇的動機居多，因爲德國在沒有戰勝的把握以前，是决不願輕易發動戰爭的，日本目前的主要企圖，還是在於征服中國，並無立即向英美進攻的决心，但是一個强盜遇到用實彈手槍相對的時候，誰能担保不發生危險，今天是恫嚇，明天也許就是戰爭，總之，太平洋的滔天巨浪，是已經掀起來了。</p>
<p>遠東風雲波及歐美自然太平洋上一切和平國家，一致團結起來，向侵略國實施軍事的經濟的道德的制裁，這樣遠東和平也許還有挽救的一錢希望。可是在太平洋大戰爆發以前，這樣的制裁到底很少可能，現在太平洋各國的統治者，天天打算着的，已經不是如何促成太平洋集體安全和和平的問題，而是如何發動或如何應付未來太平洋大戰的問題。上面已經說過，參加反共恊定的德日意三國，正在計劃分割太平洋上的白種國家殖民地，其中日本自然是遠東侵略勢力的先鋒，海南島登陸以後，表面受最大威贊的是法屬越南，但道不過是爲了政略上戰略上的需要，日本才向法國挑釁，法國是遠柬殖民地國中較弱的一國，越南和中國西南抗戰根據地接壤，直接威脅越南就等於加緊封鎖中國，和間接威脅英國。可是日本侵略的眞正目的，却不在法屬而在英屬馬來聯邦，荷屬東印度，和菲律賓澳洲。日本工業所需要的橡皮右油與其理想的人口移居地都在南洋，而菲律賓的鐵，澳洲的豐富的礦產和羊毛，尤共是日本侵略的主要目的物。除此以外法西斯侵略者，還打算暹羅作爲進攻英法　地的一個重要據點。　羅的國務總理　比布去年在廣播演說中公開宣布崇拜希德勒和墨索里尼，最近德國國防軍機關報也說：「　羅倘和日本訂結同盟，法屬越南的安全，就完全破壞了」。暹羅假如成爲亞洲的匈牙利，不但越南不保，而且緬甸和新加坡，也隨時有被侵略的危險了。在日本南進政策和法西斯集團侵略陰謀圍攻之下，英法荷蘭的殖民地已在刀鋒之下，英法荷蘭將取什麽方針保障在太平洋的領土安全呢？</p>
<p>英美法蘇切實合作</p>
<p>雖然張伯倫的外交，只知道向侵略者退讓，在西方和東方都一樣，但是在最近也開始覺悟非用武裝來維持和平不可了。英帝國要是用武裝維持和平，不用犧牲小國的方法維持和平，和平還是可以維持的。爲了共同對付國際的暴徒，英國一定能得到美國和蘇聯的合作，尤其是抗戰中的中國，是遠東和平最大的支柱。英國政府遲早一定要明白這一點：只有用一切力量支持中國抗戰，制裁日本侵略，才能保全在遠東的廣大殖民地，即使目前還不明白，事實會敎張伯倫明白的。至於法國的遠東政策，和它的西班牙政策，犯同樣的錯誤，想在「中立」這一柄破傘下，躱避風雨，結果只便宜了侵略者。現在越南在侵略者的三面包圍中，法國巳在積極增强遠東的陸海空防務，海南島對面的岡朗海灣，正在建築一等軍港。無疑的，法國的遠東政策，是要跟着英國而强化的，至於荷蘭在軍事上也不能不倚賴着英國，直到最近海牙才通過了大規模造艦案，這是遲了些，但還不算是太遲啊。羅斯福的遠東政策是完全正確的，在最近數月中間，發表了多次反侵略的演說，在利馬建立了汎美反侵略陣錢的基礎。向議會提出了關島設防案，和四年擴軍新預算案，羅斯福已經看到了法西斯侵略者的劍鋒，還沒有觸及美國，所以財閥所控制的孤立主義者，還保有一部份力量，可是美國的太平洋政策，終於要放棄孤立主義，而採取更遠大的反侵略路線，是可以斷定的。在日本侵略由北進轉爲南進的今日，蘇聯的遠東地位，一天比一天增强，但在目前，太平洋問題的槓捍，乃是中國，正因中國是爲民主和平而抗戰，所以太平洋各民族，將因中國的抗戰勝利，而享受民主與和平，太平洋問題是因日本破壞中國領土完整而直接引起的，必然要在中國收復失地之後，才得到持久的合理的解决。（愈之）</p>

<h3>萬物的應變</h3>
<p>— 臣動</p>
<p>世界上一切的變化，都可以說是爲了適應環境。一個人若感到飢餓就要吃食物，爲了寒冷就要穿衣服，若被病菌侵襲，或者身體就發熱，或者白血球增加。動物常具有保護色，以防敵人發現。駱駝因爲生長在乾燥的地方，胃裏就有水囊。植物常生硬殼的菓，或生有刺的枝，以保衛自身。這些都是天賦給生物界一種適應環境的能力。</p>
<p>可是奇怪得很，就是非生物也賦有一種應變的能力。一個人若把橡皮用手扭轉，牠就發生一種抵抗力，待手放鬆，橡皮就恢復原狀。這就是我們普通所謂的彈性。拉長與壓縮都有同樣的結果。我們若把雪塊緊壓，雪塊爲了要減少所受的壓力起見，就縮小自身的體積，所以一部份的雪就溶成了水，因爲水的體積較小。但壓力若突然放鬆，這水就立刻結成體積更大的冰塊了。一根槓棒負重物時受了壓力，槓棒爲適應環境起見，就自身彎曲。因爲彎曲的結果，棒的上部延長，發揮其張力，下部則縮短發揮其壓力，造成一對內部力偶來平衡外壓的力矩。</p>
<p>以上的幾個例子，說明萬物都能適應環境而發生應變。那末人類收到外來的侵略而羣起抗戰，也不過是一種自然的應變而已。</p>
<h3>替科學家呼冤</h3>
<p>— 水厂</p>
<p>自從世界大戰以後，我們常聽到社會一般批評：說是科學家造孽，發明了種種殺人利器，供野心家的利用，弄成一將功成萬古枯的局勢。到得近年來，眼看東亞西歐，許多人民遭受了絕大的犧牲，供飛機大砲炸彈機槍的殘殺，這種責備科學家的聲浪，更是一年高似一年。但是這都是一時的感情作用，才將理智弄糊塗了。許多人以爲科學家對於發明一種新的東西，應當負一種責任；凡是遇到對於殺人有可能性的智識和方法，須要事前預防；或是在發明以後當嚴守秘密，絕對不供人利用。照這樣說，我們上古的聖人燧人氏發明了鑽木取火，就犯了許多罪惡。他應該早見到後來的人會借火殺人，還有後世戰術裏會有火攻的方法就不鑚什麽木了。</p>
<p>黃帝造車，最初用牛引，後來用馬拉。到得兩國相爭，兵車占很重要的地位。古人又說：戎之大用在於馬，故漢高祖有馬上得天下的豪語。可見車和馬都是二十世紀以前戰爭所必需的東西。當初車就不應當發明，馬就不應當馴養了。古時鑄金爲刃。刃是指刀劍矛戟矢，可說是殺人的兇器，金是金屬，最初用銅，後來用鐵，最後用鋼。這些金屬也都不應當發明了。</p>
<p>在石器時代人類用石頭當兇器。等得大家會用了，於是爲抵抗爭存起見，就發明了弓矢的用處。後來覺得弓矢還不夠利害，就發明了火器，像火箭火銃之類。再進一步，就是近代的槍砲。誰能說禦外侮的時候，不應當費盡心血，想種種自衛的方法呢？假使有人說：我們有了傘，所以使天下雨，都一定要指他有神經病了。然則責備科學家批評物質文明的人，不是犯了同樣的毛病嗎</p>
<p>批評科學的人還要強辯，一定指近代的飛機大砲，確是科學的結晶品。試問造成飛機爲運輸上交通上的便利，和黃帝造車，有什麽分別呢。發明炸藥爲開闢山礦制服猛獸，和燧人氏取火，有什麽分別呢？科學上的發明，還是有益于人類的地方多呢？有害于人類的地方多呢？即使科學家代人受過，屈打成招了種種莫須有殺人放火的罪名，恐怕將功折罪起來，已經是功多罪少哩。</p>
<p>兵器決不能強分做兩種，一種自衛和一種攻人的。單講自衛，不講攻人，是消極的抵抗。但是絕對消極的抵抗，是沒有這回事。要求抵抗侵略的工作，必須尋求相當有效的還擊的方法和力量，方才能有把握呀。</p>
<p>總之，科學家決不能預料一種發明，有沒有不正當的應用，亦決不能防止一種發明，給不講道義的人利用着爲非作惡。並且有時明知一種發明，於人類不見得有什麽好處，爲了環境的特殊關係，也不能不努力進行，批評的人總須放棄主觀的態度，才能公允哩。</p>
<h3>科學聊齋</h3>
<p>— 驥千</p>
<p>大王</p>
<p>蛇係涼血動物，屬於爬蟲類，在動物界中，其位置居鳥類之下，兩棲類（蛙蟾蜍蠑螈等皆屬於此類）之上，稍具生物學知識者，類能言之。乃吾國以科學落後，不獨無知鄉民指爲神物，即士大夫亦信奉之，可哂亦可憐已。例如黃河中有水蛇數種，身皆細小，居民信爲河神，稱之爲大王。蛇之外部搆造彼此不同，遂有各種大王之名號，有所謂黃大王者，栗大王者，金龍四大王者，時時出現。蓋蛇亦有兩棲之習性，時居水中，時居陸地。偶由河中遷居岸上，爲居民所見，則以爲大王出現，必報告於地方長官，派員恭迎，盛以玉盤，覆以黃緞，香花供養於專祠之中，爲之演劇做了，士女頂禮膜拜，絡繹不絕，數日後蛇遯匿無蹤，以爲大王飛昇矣，官吏士庶惴惴焉唯恐虔誠稍有不至，大王怒而黃河必有潰決之禍。一次大王出現，迎至廟中，獻戲方酣，香火鼎盛之際，竟在盤中枯斃，官吏皆驚愕不知所出，乃召河上船戶專司迎候大王者詢之，船戶卽向官吏鞠躬致賀曰，此大吉也，一大王脫袍　，長官當有陞遷之喜，於是皆額手相慶，將大王遺殼，仍恭送至黃河中云。</p>
<p>將軍</p>
<p>黃河中之蛇旣爲大王矣，而該處之蜥蜴，亦拔茅連茹，稱爲將軍。案蜥蜴亦爬蟲類之一，係涼血動物，與鱷魚，龜等動物較爲相近。黃河水中及岸上時時有蜥蜴之出現，居民奉事亦虔，特未能如供大王之典禮隆重耳。</p>
<p>咬狐</p>
<p>狐仙之說，爲一班無識者所深信。狐係一哺乳類，在動物學中屬於食肉目之犬科。有所謂紅狐者，藍狐者，銀狐者，灰狐者，種類不一，其皮皆有價值。狐性最黠，小說中輙言其能仙，吾國人民缺乏科學常識，竟信以爲眞。某處有一養馬之圈，圉人某居其中。夜間有狐出入其室，圉人大懼，疑爲所祟，遂發生心疾，狐又喜近其身，於是妖夢屢作，其病日篤，竟至不起。主任憐其家貧，以其弟繼之，其弟亦死。於是此馬圈遂爲凶宅，無人敢入焉。後有一叟任牧芻之職，叟性戇，不信鬼狐之說，以狐皮可以製裘，狐肉何嘗不可充食，當捉而烹之，以饜吾腹。一日叟　眠，狐來其側，適近口邊，叟遽咬之，狐痛　而竄，皮毛脫落，墨於齒際，鮮血淋漓，殷濡枕席，而其患遂絕焉。</p>
<h3>無綫電　將被太陽災變擾亂</h3>
<p>意大利地震學者之預言　本月廿五廿六兩日</p>
<p>太陽黑子之出現，大約每十一年爲一循環，此一二年內似乎正在達其最強度，所謂太陽災變即指此而言。</p>
<p>近據羅馬斯丹范尼通訊社云：地震學者朋丹第（Benddani）宣稱「一種劇烈的太陽災變，其強度一如去年九月所有者，已不可避免。我們的地球將遭遇可怕的反響，尤其在擾亂電磁的平衡和無綫電交通。此項擾亂將普及於全世界。短波無綫電將受嚴重影響，在三月廿五和廿六兩日收　將爲不可能。」他又說「任何人有一具短波收音機者，如調整在十五米至二十五米之間，很容易測出這種現象。除了無綫電被擾亂外，還要起磁暴現象和北極光。」</p>
<h3>重！</h3>
<p>— （金五）</p>
<p>世界上無論什麽東西都沒有星球的核心那樣重。假使你的錶成比例地重到那種程度，那末稱起來差不多就有一噸的重量，而不能隨身携带了。假使你把它放在桌上，必把桌子壓毀。</p>
<p>科學家說，有些星球的核心所以有這樣大的重量，是因為造成星球核心的物質比我們地球上的物質密實得多，換句話說，即是那種物質裏的空隙極小。假使把造成一個一百八十磅之人體的物質團結密實，裏面完全沒有空隙，那末，這個人就小得只有針頭大了！但是，這個針頭大的人，却有一百八十磅的體重。</p>
<h3>水底藏軍需品</h3>
<p>— 玉尚</p>
<p>軍需品藏在此種巨櫃內，沉於水中，可免敵之飛機轟炸</p>
<p>汽油和食料等等，在戰時極關重要，可貯藏於巨大櫃內，沈在湖或河底一百呎或更深，使敵轟炸機無從窺見。這是瑞士當局在吞湖做了若干試騐所得的結論。試騐時用一只一二·〇〇〇加侖容量的櫃沉下一百呎深；據偵察者說，飛機在三千呎高度以上偵查時，完全看不到什麽形跡。現在工程師正籌畫用特質的筏來迅速把櫃升降云。</p>
<p>用來起落巨櫃的筏</p>
<h3>世界科學消息</h3>
<p>飛機之母</p>
<p>昔人謂蜻蜓六足四翼，翱翔乎天地之間，今日之飛機，其形蓋有取於此乎？半世紀以前，美國郎雷（Langley）教授，物理學之耆宿也，曾留意於此，竭平生之力，研究飛行之術，欲創一機，遨遊雲表。當氏研究此術，聞者嗤之，以爲絕不可能。迨其機造成，試騐再四，居然可以昇空駕禦，乃於廣衆中表演之。時日觀者如堵，皆欲見所未見。不幸其所創之機，較爲笨重，駕駛者亦一時不愼，飛騰甫起，竟撞河上之船桅，機身破碎，機師墜於河上。觀衆大噱，各報紙載爲笑話。氏時已年近七十，經此失敗，心中抑鬱，未幾病歿。其門人故舊咸悼憫之。然其所發表之原理，實精確不磨，特其機初造，未能如近世之靈便精巧耳。其後有來特氏（Wright）兄弟二人潛心此學，悉本郎氏之學理，改良建造，遂有新式飛機之出世；繼之者精益求精，美國創造飛機之事業。日新而月盛焉。當歐洲大戰之末期，美國加入戰事，大舉訓練空軍，其國內閣無數之飛機塲，而其最大之總機塲，即以郎雷名之（LangleyField）以紀念其創始之功。然則氏生前不幸，身後卒享大名，是足爲苦心孤詣，命運蹭蹬之士告慰矣。</p>
<p>地磁研究用的船</p>
<p>地球是一大磁石，地球表面是一大磁塲，各處的磁力強度和方向各異，所以必須時時加以測定，繪成地磁圖，以供航海者應用。英國現正在建造一艘測量地磁用的船，造價十萬金鎊，命名曰「研究」號，不日即可完工。這船完全用非磁性的材料建造。船殼用麻栗木，構架和樑柱用青銅或其他非磁性合金。錨，纜和一切螺釘均用青銅製，即廚房器具也不用鐵。任何船員均不許携带鋼質裁紙刀。船上雖裝着一具重油發動機，但行船大部份靠風帆。排水量爲六百五十噸，帶足燃料後，可以每小時六海里的速度行二千英里。船上可容船員和研究人員三十一人。</p>
<p>這「研究」號是世界上第二隻非磁性船。第一隻是美國的「長南奇」號，於一九二九年在薩摩亞羣島炸毀；她曾做了二十五年地磁測量工作，對於全世界各國有莫大之貢獻。</p>
<p>— （英國物理學評論，雛）</p>
<p>番茄製橡皮</p>
<p>據說意大利化學家毛里博士（Dr.Manri）發表他已完成一種秘密方法，可從番茄（tomato）的皮製成天然橡皮的代替品。用這方法，需用四百噸番茄製成一噸人造橡皮。惟意大利年產番茄僅四十萬噸，故只能製出一千噸「橡皮」，其量甚少，只及全世界天然橡皮年產總量約八百份之一。</p>

<h3>文殊普賢</h3>
<p>— 橋下客</p>
<p>文殊菩薩，普賢菩薩，是兩位菩薩。菩薩與人生發生關係是現在還不能否認的事實。要使菩薩與科學發生關係，恐怕科學老闆要金剛怒目，智識份子不由得呪上一聲阿彌陀佛，只有方丈長老雙手合十曰，善哉善哉，坐飛機去也。然而文殊普賢非但至今還與我們的人生發生關係，而且正因到了今日才與科學發生關係。同科學的那一門發生關係呢？遺傳學，婦科，產科。難道菩薩會包養兒子嗎？哦！這是絕大的誤會。</p>
<p>文殊普賢到了人家結婚的時候，比主婚人證婚人介紹人還要受人尊敬，老早的供在禮堂正中，來賓都得向他們倆跪拜或鞠躬。現在諸位明白了，原來就是所謂和合一。當然，數典忘祖是很平常的事，歷史老據又有所待於胡博士，現在我們但知供和合的意義，也許取其和與合而已。可是問題就從這裏發生。究竟他們倆——文殊與普賢——還是一夫一妻或一僧一尼呢，還是一兄一弟或一姊一妹呢？於是運用科學法寶與修辭手段，不妨武斷爲非姊妹即兄弟，此外無其他可能。這種武斷的來歷是這樣來的：我們先假定和與合是由傳說得來的所稱他們倆的特徵，其次眼見供軸上的繡　彼此面貌身材一般無二。那麼，就醫學研究所得，他們倆顯然是雙生子，而且是一個胞胎裏邊的雙生子。原來一個胞胎裏邊的雙生子，非但面貌身材一樣，就是性別也一樣，性情也一樣，和得來一塌糊塗，合得來一塌糊塗。難怪一個出家，另一個也出家。至於各有一個胞胎的雙生子，就是兩個胞胎的雙生子，性別不必一樣，性情更不必一樣，往往　有互相仇視嫉妬的。根據產科的統計，平均每八十個生產之中，就有一次是雙生子，雖然不必一來就是同一胞胎的雙生子，但可決定自古至今必不止一對文殊普賢了。然而只有文殊普賢以和合之名參加婚禮，其故安在。我想，孟夫子的話可以借用一下：紂之不善，不如是之甚也；紂可以代表一切壞事，也可以代表一切壞人，這是皇帝的地位作成了他。文殊普賢做了菩薩，地位不見得在皇帝之下，他們倆就代表了一切同胞雙生子，事有可能。那麼，我們何以要捧雙生子作偶像呢？因爲雙生子究屬不多，稀罕的東西每被人們認作特殊的魔力所寄，於是敬畏之而偶像之，這是中外一例的。和合是崇拜雙生子的遺跡，這一點大槪不會錯到那裏。</p>
<p>今日遺傳學向前進取，以雙生子的研究爲重要根據點之一，而受孕與生產又屬產婦科的範圍，弄得文殊普賢外披袈裟，內穿燕尾，都爲時代所驅，倒也別致可喜。</p>
<h3>陸上行舟</h3>
<p>— 大興</p>
<p>即使閣下是個初出茅廬的騎腳踏車者，總該領略過逆風的淫威。如果風勢稍大，則閣下必費九牛二虎之力，始可踏進。如果風勢更大，就有行不得也哥哥之慨。那時際，只得翻身下馬，拉着馬兒前進，連聲喚道：「累我！累我！」</p>
<p>但是，如果是順風的話，那就不必有勞足下，風會推着尊背，浩浩蕩蕩，投奔孫家莊去，而閣下又必連聲喚道：「快哉此風！」</p>
<p>現在，一背之微，已足使你乘風破浪；假使在車上高　一帆，豈不更可風馳電掣？美國佛羅里達省有二位少年，即本此方針做去，結果居然實現了陸上行舟的奇蹟。這張照片，是當他們經過邁安邁地方某街道時所拍得的。</p>

<p>造成學生人人有衛國自衛與自治治國意識與本能、我人須實行學記上所說之『爲之師然後爲之長』、而與政治社會貫通、負組訓民衆責任、古人謂、『相觀而善爲之摩』、敎育家豈可忍心社會一般同胞之愚昧痛苦乎、我尤須根　國家經濟建設之需要、敎授國民重勞動能生產、尤其鼓勵創造能力、一切敎育計劃在在與經濟計劃相配合、而後我敎育始能成爲現代國家生命力所由造成之一個因素、旋復勗以三事、第一件事、認淸尊師重道意義、表率靑年風動民衆、第二件事、陶冶國民人格標準、以禮義廉恥爲各級學校共同校調、第三件事齊一趨向集中目標、努力實現三民主義、最後希望敎界同仁、自立自重、專心一致、終身貢獻於敎育敎國之大事業、（編者按、蔣委員長訓詞原文、已登三月五日本報、）</p>

<h3>出差汽車往虹口　被暗殺原因</h3>
<p>日人欲專利營業</p>
<p>特出此恐怖手段</p>
<p>據二十一日法文上海日報載、據可靠方面消息、在最近兩星期中、蘇州河北岸、迭發現有出差汽車夫被害事件、現聞此等事件發生之理由、蓋因日方在虹口方面、創有若干交通公司、企圖專利蘇州河北之運輸等事業、然而在租界方面之居民、雅欲僱用雲飛及大陸兩外商公司之汽車、以往虹口、是以在日人方面、乃欲以恐怖手段、以使各外商之出差汽車、不敢再駛入虹口營業、而冀遂其專利之企圖、現聞雲飛及大陸兩公司之出差汽車夫、果已大感恐慌、相率不敢應虹口方面僱客之僱用矣但依捕房方面之調查、則對於上述日人恐怖手段之傳說、仍未能證實之、藎以迄至今止、尙未破獲有關於此案之罪犯與綫索也、然而在實際上、則罪案旣發生於虹口、故此案之偵查、殊甚為難、</p>
<h3>義泰興煤棧經理　被控敎唆誣告</h3>
<p>誣指林嘉賓為刦案盜黨　使林備受痛楚幾至殘廢</p>
<p>新閘路義泰興煤棧於本年一月十五日晚被盜多名侵入刦去法幣的三萬數千元、報告新閘捕房、飭探於翌晨帶同該棧夥胡廷詳孟振家、至各公共塲所兜祭盜黨、當經過靜安寺路赫德路口時、胡孟二人、向探稱七路公共汽車上有一乘客、其</p>
<p>面貌極似</p>
<p>隔晚持槍監視之盜匪、探遂上前將該人拘捕、帶回捕房、據此人供名林嘉賓、二十九歲、台州人、住麥高包綠路安樂坊六號、開設福華櫗廠、乃屬正常商人、並未為盜、但胡孟二人及其同棧夥友五人、則堅指林確與執槍盜面貌相同、致棘遭受八日之覊押、備受痛苦、</p>
<p>幾成殘廢</p>
<p>後經捕房查明林確無關係、始得回復自由、林於出獄之後、以本人此决橫遭寃獄、全由胡孟二人之誣指、而該義泰興煤棧經理沈錦洲、應負敎唆之責、且以此决之被誣、在身體上旣遭受重大痛苦、而名譽上亦蒙受損害、故特委許武芳律師致函與沈錦洲</p>
<p>要求登報</p>
<p>道歉以回復名譽、乃沈竟復函拒絕、林不得已、乃延范剛·兪恩良·陸起·律師、具狀特一法院、對沈錦洲·胡廷祥·孟振家·提起偽證及誣告之訴、請求治以刑法一百六十八條一百六十丸條之罪、昨晨此案由馮世德推事開刑一庭訊理、以偽證部份不能提起自訴、故僅就</p>
<p>誣告部份進行、據被告方面之抗辯、則謂指認之事、沈錦洲根本不知、而林之面貌確與盜匪中之一相似、故有此誤會、但原告律師以一决之誤會、尙有可說、乃被告等在捕房第二次指認時、仍堅决指林似為盜黨者之一、致原告飽受痛苦云云、庭上以事實明瞭、遂論令兩造律師辯論後、宣告終結定期宜判、</p>

<p>貨幣問題</p>
<h3>破壞法幣的頓挫</h3>
<p>— 孝慧</p>
<p>早半月前，上海有一部分商人與北方貨物有往來的，都抱着「日偽」於本年三月十一日起華北不行使法幣的疑慮，允其是生油豆油生仁等以山東運來居多，因是投機之風在燉，生油漲度銳不可遏。但是頭腦冷靜的人們，對此早抱着一個（？）在腦筋中，以為法幣的基礎，深入民間，難道就這樣容易摧毀麽？稍有常識的，都知道這是「日偽」的如意算盤，何况用有準備的法幣，去換無準備的偽鈔及軍用票，無論愚笨拙劣到如何程度，以及處於淫威虐政之下，這利害輕重，人人都會判別的，亦人人會趨吉避凶的。果然，到了這時候，日偽有例外之聲明，近如北平政聞報（法文）所載，更可證實了。其言云：</p>
<p>『此間「臨時政府」前曾發「令」自三月十一日起，在華北境內禁止法幣之行使，但此「令」顯已失效，而用變相之方法撤回之矣。此方式維何？蓋即規定「匪區」之內，尙可通用法幣，而其所謂「匪區」者，即中國軍勢力所在之游擊區也』</p>
<p>這一段記載，巳證明日人之銀樣蠟槍頭，其所以如此，茲為使一般讀者多能明瞭這種事實起見，不妨另作一番陳述：</p>
<p>自民國二十四年，實施新貨幣政策以後，法幣已很合原理地建築在國家信用的基礎之上，不若以前純以銀行信用為轉變了。因此，法幣在根深蒂固和有堅强的政府信用為後盾，「日偽」方面的陰謀，豈能倖致。在日偽所控制的區域，表面雖不得不被迫暫時行使，但在人民心理，何曾甘心承受。現在再分別說明這種有利法幣抗戰的原因：</p>
<p>（一）華北表面上雖是淪陷區，但日軍佔據的，僅是寥寥可數的幾個城市；大部分土地，仍在我軍游擊隊手中。在該游擊區內，一切均依照中央政府制定的取締日偽鈔票辦法，如使用偽鈔，處以極刑。故向該區採購貨物，均用法幣，於灶法幣仍建立在廣大的游擊區中。</p>
<p>（二）偽鈔本身毫無準備，不能購買外滙。日方在成立偽銀行的時候，原擬在　得留存在華北的白銀六千萬元，作為購買外滙之準備金，惟結果，此項白銀均存於天津租界各銀行，不能掠奪到手。</p>
<p>（三）天津租界，北平使館區，歡迎法幣。</p>
<p>（四）外商銀行拒絕以偽鈔出售外滙。</p>
<p>根據以上幾點，證明法幣是建築在合理的經濟原則，中外人民的樂於使用，和國際方面的信用的堡壘之上，地位堅强鞏固，决非「日偽」方面隨便可以摧毀的。</p>
<p>因之法幣在華北，不但沒有被偽鈔所驅逐，並且反在照比例數字增加，茲將偽銀行一尙未成立，「偽鈔」尙未發行之前，和在「偽鈔」發行近一年，並且聲稱將要停止使用的現在，在華北的法幣流通額如下：根據中央銀行發表，（單位元）</p>
<p>二十七年三月五日止</p>
<p>中央銀行　三五、八七四、六五五</p>
<p>中國銀行　一四八九〇二、五〇〇</p>
<p>交通銀行　七〇、二一〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>四行　一、五〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>中國實業　銀行一、七五〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>中國農工銀行　一、五〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>墾業銀行　九〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>浙江興業銀行　二〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>大中銀行　五六〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>河北省銀行　五〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>邊業銀行　五〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>北洋保商銀行　三、〇〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>共計　三一三、四五七、一五五</p>
<p>二十八年一月二十八日止</p>
<p>中央銀行　三六、四九一、七〇五</p>
<p>中國銀行　一六二、二三三、一〇〇</p>
<p>交通銀行　七八、五〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>四行　一、五〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>中國實業銀行　一、七五〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>中國農工銀行　一、五〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>墾業銀行　九〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>浙江興業銀行　二〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>大中銀行　五六〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>河北省銀行　五〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>共計　三三二、一四〇、八〇五</p>
<p>依上列數字比較，則知法幣在偽鈔壓迫的過去十偭月中，華北法幣增加計一八，六八三，六五〇元，其中尙有因北洋保商，及邊業兩銀行被偽銀行改組，兩行鈔票三，〇五〇，〇〇〇元，被偽銀行攫去，故第二數字中少三，〇五〇，〇〇〇元，實際上中中交三行法幣，十月中，增加計達二千一百七十三萬三千六百五十元，可見並不被「偽鈔」壓迫而减少了。</p>
<p>「偽鈔」是變相的日鈔，日鈔本身的準備，已極度减創釗將要分文不值的了。試看日本存金僅有二萬萬元，而日本鈔票原本限於一億二千萬日元，自向中國實施侵略之後，增至十億日元，最近已達二十二億日元，日本軍閥還要求增發五億日元，而為二十七億日元，這種情形，以及日本物價的暴騰，其結果不但他們財政上無辦法，日本人民生活痛苦，行將不堪言狀了。</p>
<p>因之，他在中國淪陷區的掠奪，必將變本加厲了。不過，他要在華中華南推行「偽鈔」，不但為歐美列强更加痛惡，即日本人民亦將感覺不快，其結果勢必做到以物易物，無所謂現金收入，阻礙他們對外的貿易，所以日軍在華的侵略，以後</p>
<p>（一）利用武力，覇占中國戰區內一切生利的產業；</p>
<p>（二）利用武力，來統制中國各地的產物；</p>
<p>（三）用橫徵暴歛的手段搜刮中國的資財；</p>
<p>（四）發掘掠奪中國民間的儲藏財物；</p>
<p>（五）發「軍用票」換取中國的貨物和法幣；</p>
<p>近來上海市塲的日鈔買賣，異常旺盛，此現象之為何如，目前無從討論。即對於中國法幣的前途，以及應付「日偽」的破壞法幣，在這非常時期，亦無從談起。因為談得切實些，或者討論得有辦法，在報章發表，為人家見了，無異做了「張松默地圖」，不知不覺間替他們準備抵制破壞的方略。假如所說所論的，不是「歌功頌德」，即是「高頭講章」，那亦何貴乎有此等論文，眩惑視聽，增長虛驕之氣，適足以僨事。何况捫壁（不是捫蝨）而談，要能「夫人不言，言必有中，」不亦「戞戞乎其難哉！」不過，如有眞知灼見，何不向有責者去獻替，尙不失為辦法。</p>
<p>可是最膚淺的幾句話，可以觀察法幣的前途：</p>
<p>（一）法幣信用巳深入民間；</p>
<p>（二）得着友邦的信任支持；</p>
<p>（三）使「日偽」鈔無停留機會；</p>
<p>（四）允實游擊區的政洽組織；</p>
<p>但是滬上黑匯的買賣，怎樣加以統制，如何使外匯不為人所利用，而仍不妨礙對歐美的貿易；不過，處心積慮破壞法幣的人們，心沒有死，未來的變化正多着呢；不是文字所能收效的呀！</p>
<h3>紗花　國棉幾將斷絕　紗廠改向外棉追求</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市因歐洲政局絞為緩和及華盛頓方面又有議員在國會中、對美棉之在海外傾銷、表示反對、要求政府令美棉之在海外銷售、需照普通在美之市價不得有意傾跌、因之棉市略受反應、上漲十餘磅音、印度連同預測漲三羅比餘、埃及亦漲廿餘磅音、昨日匯兌無甚軒輊、折合法幣、棉價俱漲、計美棉及巴西棉每担漲一元二角半、印棉漲一元二角、埃及棉漲三元、</p>
<p>滬市外棉交易、連日紗銷轉佳、紗廠亦有巨額開出、昨日申新開出廿支天女雙馬共的二千餘件、對於棉額將欲補進、然二十支原棉、以印棉最為合算、唯印棉之水脚困難、本年度印棉之輸華數額特多、印度碼頭候運來滬之印棉堆積甚擠、雖印棉船時有來滬聞、然運來之數尙係小額也、目前國棉幾將斷絕、購買美棉價尙稍貴、購辦印棉、又未能尅期抵達、各廠均深感難以購棉之苦、昨日祇有新裕進巴西棉現貨二百包、餘廠均無交易聞、茲將昨日棉價分列於後、</p>
<p>本棉生意依然沉悶、但售價堅穩如恒，蓋以紗市疲憊不振、廠胃不健、且外棉換算價較華棉仍廉、然各廠尙未大量拖進、昨日申新進五百件、據一部份消息、中外各廠正在談判中、不過近來已到一萬件左右、業巳解廠、日廠需用充足、目前無亟亟辦棉之舉、故對於本棉絕無嘗試之念、然底貨殊枯、來源蘇北一路、雖未斷絕、然包脚微乎其微、據云浦東有六船火機花運滬被阻、目前正在交涉中、是吾放運、尙無把握、處此環境之下、棉價頗難鬆懈也、碼頭上到通州細絨花三百八十九包、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<h3>客帮嫌價貴　三二支　單紗回跌十元</h3>
<p>申新開出二十支紗二千七百包</p>
<p>紗市轉趨疲途、蓋以連朝猛抬狂騰之三二去單紗價、客帶旣嫌昂貴、且又不近情理之上升、故竟停辦、加之浙東日艦擾攘不休、甬申滙水緊縮、貨價暗中抬高、於是人心受其打擊、多方雖欲做作、鑒於事實所不許、有一部份浮多吐出、市價乃驟然下跌十元至三元、三二支天女價為五百六十元、然查其實際情形、仍在高峰、至於二十支紗市、本因存貨增、消費缺、氣勢平庸、單紗價一軟、跌風又起、兼之廠方復來開出、籌碼一鬆、揑手之貨、照市甩出矣、午後仍　平淡無勁、市象允、疲云、</p>
<p>現紗情形、當初開盤三二支單紗計價喊五百八十元、然客方因逐步飛騰、無怠購買、由此反映驟起、客帮不辦、且廠家迅速改紡矣、氣勢一平、即跌十元外、二十支雙馬開價勿動、仍做三百九十六元半、繼以廠方開出人心陡懈、同時實需不莊、步開步弱、最後價為三百九十三元七角、棧單價為三百九十二元、午後市况仍屬閑散、客方交易、因天雨允稀、結果查全日各帮買去統計一千四百四十包、行情二十支雙馬價比上日跌三元二角半、天女跌二元、單紗價跌十元、惟十支十六支尙堅定如恒、申新廠開出二十支雙馬紗一千七百包、二十支天女一千包、價均為三百九十五元、每包付定洋四十元、昨由天津遝來棉紗五百件、茲將各帮成交之額量錄左、</p>
<p>日紗市塲異常蕭索、各帮需要殊淸、故人心平平、惟北方近來布疋交易旺盛、日紗價尙能帶昂一步、二十支水月現紗價為三百三十九元、二十支藍鳳現紗價為三百二十八元、比上日疲一元光景、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆需要清淡</h3>
<p>邇來黃豆需要頗冷淡、蓋杜豆沙黃、在時令上已落伍、但其潛勢仍無一不在上漲中、且到頭將絕、存貨日枯（大連豆除外（、故脚地鞏固、昨崇明沙黃做開五十包、價為八元五角、小分許、浦東杜豆成交五十包、價為十元零三角、中粒豆成妥百餘包、價九元一角、現大連豆成二車、價為八元二角半至三角、跌去一角半、四月份亦小一角五分妥開四車、價為八元二角二至八元二角半、刻下連豆趨勢、全在大連市控制中、</p>
<h3>油市　豆油人心略虛　花生油回升五角</h3>
<p>昨日花生油市况、前日猛挫之下、回升五角、蓋以醞釀多日之到頭、依然渺茫故囤戶手貨不願賤脫、結果祇成交膠州油三十件、價為二十九元五角、豆油已成為大連油之世界、昨大連休市、本埠人心因前日大連收盤市報跌、故潛勢疲乏、上午不論期現一致挫三角外、午後交易見增、市氣轉緊、結果比上日市小去一二角不等、統市做開、現大連油一百桶、價為三十二元至三十二元一角、三月下三百餘桶、價為三十一元六角至三十一元九角、四月份千餘桶、價為三十一元六角至三十一元八角、五月份百餘桶、價為三十一元五角半云、</p>
<h3>海味　螟蜅去路開展</h3>
<p>螟蜅前市頗見挺　一致需求者徘徊不前、銷路頓减、乃近日巳漸回低、而建汕兩帮亦陸續動辦、刻市寗波外山蜅為三十元至三十一元、山東蜅四十八元、查正舟山蜅、此間存貨已乏、僅有　　七十元而已、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲市頗受　歐局影響</h3>
<p>昨橫濱絲市停業、紐約續疲、惟里昂一埠、絲價略向上回、紐約八三·七五日絲及七八分上海各跌八分，廣東絲未開、交易所近期遠期各跌三分、故紐的華絲市價扯算起來、已進一七〇〇元關、的在一六五〇元左右矣、里昂絲市、略好上半法郞至一法郞、但歐洲絲銷、則因時局不靖、人心惶惶之故、更無交易、</p>
<p>本埠絲市、內外絲交同寂、買賣雙方均觀望歐局變化、印度洋行略進粗土絲五担、價亦疲軟、總之、日來絲市強形呆滯云、</p>
<p>意國人造絲又到一批、計一千八百五十一箱、由意輪維多利亞號裝來、於前日二十日抵滬、停靠虹口順泰碼頭起卸、</p>
<h3>疋頭　廠布又將重施審查　閩帮趕裝倍形忙碌</h3>
<p>國布本色染色疋頭、川粵帮現需、續見擴展、浙東聞溫州帮接當地來電、遭日機轟炸、鎭海口中亦遭砲轟、人心不安、辦貨即露猶豫之態、各貨售盤、仍維持平衡狀態、獨永安大鵬細布廠盤索價四月份期貨十三元五角、手貨亦趨緊昂、小額賣開十三元三角半、較前日加起一角、粵帮採辦色斜一百餘箱、大鵬富貴等牌細布一百二十包、富貴愛字等牌細斜一百包、川帮採辦深淺色藍布三千餘疋、均由越南經滇貴輸往、閩帮為辦理登記事、現暫准裝貨二批、以濟市面需要、此後又須停止輸往、再經嚴密審查後施行、該第二批昨日趕運、故該帮購辦各貨倍形忙碌、</p>
<p>東布昨因客銷寥落、本街需胃亦淡、同業放空頭者、又乘機拋售、細布細斜如龍頭·飛魚兩牌每疋驟降五分至七分半、下檔喇叭細布寳貝細斜染銷去勢仍盛、成交六百餘包、喇叭售開每疋十二元〇五分、寶貝十一元五角、後市聞東棉洋行收進細布一二百件、人心復堅、故中下檔各牌售盤結果與前日相彷、印花貨嗶嘰色丁花布之類、仍極佾俐、</p>
<p>毛織品於二十日由意國運來七十五箱、</p>
<h3>客秈趁低又有收買　洋元米昨已抵埠　粳米去路仍呆滯</h3>
<p>客秈昨晨有行囤回出、市價立見抑低四五分至近角不等、惟介小後、引起新囤及本街零化之趁機收買、市面又轉站勢、而成交數乃增至三千餘包、蕪秈開十二元九角、南京高喊十三元二三角未妥、僅有中决成議、</p>
<p>洋元米昨已到埠、隨市售開元米　百餘包、價十六元八角、作一百六十市斤計算、為茶食磨粉去化、洋元米未經售開、洋米西貢開出二百多包、價仍在十七元一二角云、</p>
<p>杜米來源河下祇到三號、車運包子一千餘包、囤戶及本街銷塲依然呆滯、故形勢頗軟、不過天雨到稀、售方心思殊堅、結果各貨雖做開有限、而市面勉呈定局、厚薄粳包子貨價無甚上落、僅河下貨垂軟數分至一角、杜洋埠尖及變元仍守原盤、</p>
<h3>糧食　廠盤抑低後　麵粉客銷活躍</h3>
<p>麵粉日昨市况漸趨平定、查廠盤經前日一度抑低五分後、本客進胃遂見活躍、天津烟台威海等處整批交易頗有開展之望、南洋帮去化亦絞前日為貪、兼之洋粉產價稍昂、四月份期貨額滿、五月份花旗粉每桶價美金二元五角八分至六角、與前價相仿、因無船位、暫乏成交、昨有某洋行打出澳洲粉獅子牌電報、每噸的六金鎊、每包合價須四元三四角、尙無回電、在歐洲風雲瀰漫、洋麥報漲之際、人心似覺好轉、故廠盤恐難再小矣、統市成二號粉及三四號粉各有二三萬包、二號粉價四元六角半、三號粉四元五角牛、四號粉四元三角、市面或可站定一時云、</p>
<p>小麥來源殊見寥落、長江一帶、因產價高昂、及某方統制之卜、到貨幾告絕跡、附近滬寗路偶有零星抵埠、執貨者認為奇貨可居、喊價特昂、故廠胃亦不貪取、聞廠方收價的在六元八角至七元、而客帮售價可到七元二三角、正式市面、仍無做開云、</p>

<h3>歐局與中國抗戰</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>我對於中國的抗戰，徹底是個樂觀派，以為不論在任何不利的環境下，只要我們始終團結一致，不屈不撓，抗戰到底，最後的勝利總是我們的。所以現在歐洲風雲陡起，地圖變色，我還是抱着這個樂觀。</p>
<p>不過我不是盲目的自信，我有我的理由，允其歐局的變幻，甚至引起大戰，我認為對於我們，只是利多而害少</p>
<p>當然，我們的敵人，耍乘這英法諸國無暇東顧的機會，來加緊他們的侵略，更要乘他們的同謀者法西斯黨徒，在歐洲作威作福的時期，隨在後面搖旗吶喊，並且格外努力，來壓逼我們，表示他們的忠於同謀，忠於法西斯主義。然而，第一，我們的抗戰，本來是用的自已的人力，並沒有借用別國的一兵一卒；第二，我們的物力，也因得天獨厚，永不會枯竭；第三，由歐洲運入的軍火，以及一切需要的物件，本來並不很多，將來即使斷絕，還有美國和蘇聯作我們的後盾。從這三點看來，消極地說，歐洲的變局，不論現在或將來，都於我們無害。</p>
<p>積極方面呢？就是於我們有利的呢？則第一，促進民洽國家聯合的决心，一致起來粉碎法西斯國家的迷夢，假使他們還有餘力的，就一定格外會援助我們；第二，民治國家的實力，究竟遠在法西斯國家之上，一旦實行聯合，法西期國家就非受挫折不可，影響所及，我們的敵人，在國際間更其勢孤力弱，乃是必然的結果；第三，萬一因歐洲大戰而引起世界大戰，則我們的抗戰，就確實成為民治國對法西斯國全部抗戰的一環，民治國勝利之日，就是我們勝利之日，猶如當初比利時的被蹂躪，終得恢復起來一樣，而民治國的勝利，則是不容懷疑的。將來事實。歸納這三點，歐洲的變局，不論現在或將來，還只是於我們有利。</p>
<p>因此，我對於我國的抗戰，本來是樂觀的，在現在就更其樂觀了。</p>
<p>不過，我再說，我的樂觀是根據着我們的團結一致，抗戰到底的，所以我們還該這樣努力下去。</p>
<h3>迎着晨曦</h3>
<p>— 星火</p>
<p>——游擊區的報人生活</p>
<p>急忙地跳出床去，鬧鐘的鈴聲還沒停止；睜開惺忪的睡眼，點起燭火來。接上電流的收音機，開始發出『刺·刺·揷·揷…』的音響來；不多一會，『長沙廣播電台……』一遍一遍重複地報告着，這聲音裏夾雜着『咩。咩……』，原來驚醒了熟睡着的羊。</p>
<p>莊嚴的國歌奏了出來，接着是高唱，我們肅然地起立，低着頭，沉痛地憶念着過去集合數千羣衆在廣塲上高唱着國歌，向着竿頭直上的國旗敬禮的光景。現在，在刺刀炸彈的黑影下，我們還能聽到遙遠地從我們的大後方傳來的歌聲。這歌聲能使我們落淚，更能使我們奮起。</p>
<p>『現在，開始報告新聞！……』我們各人擒住鉛筆，把耳朶儘可能地凑近揚聲器。這時，時鐘報着四點，板窗外的天空，還綴着疏落的晨星。</p>
<p>手裏的筆追蹤着從揚聲器裏躍出的音波，一張張白紙被畫滿了不整齊的綫條和圈兒，從我們的筆底送出來。</p>
<p>這時，我們的喜樂全給那抑揚的音波所支配：我們時而擔憂，時而又忍不住發出在笑，雖然我們知道錄音是怎樣需要着冷靜的頭腦。</p>
<p>雞啼着，灶間裏也發出『刮·刮…』的劈柴聲。一位老伯伯照例地踱出來，咳了幾聲之後，對我們慇懃地說着：『先生們好早呵，比我們還早啦！』『唔，』我們一面寫一面漫應着。『先生，今天聽出來的「市面」怎樣啦』？他好意地問着，可是不知道我們實在沒工夫回答。</p>
<p>『啵·啵……』老伯伯拿起裝足了烟的旱烟管，向着我們的燭火上伸過來，燭火跟着他的一吸，低了下去。我們眼前一片黑，一串音波就溜了過去，再也捉不住；但是我們不會埋怨他，因為他是為了省一根寳貴的火柴啊！</p>
<p>晨曦逐走了黑夜，湔洗着天幕上的　痕；一輪朝陽正升起來，拂曉的風帶着淡淡的凉</p>
<p>時間在工作的進行中顯得格外的短促，當揚聲器裹發出的音波因氣壓的驟變而漸漸地低下去時，晨光從屋頂的天窗上透進來，鐘面的時針正移到「6字上面。</p>
<p>迎着晨曦，我們走到野外，踏着含滿露水的靑草與野花。我們舒展着胸，飽吸着朝氣，握緊了拳，向着我們的前方打去。</p>
<h3>所謂「和平」</h3>
<h3>論「書生」的「白面」</h3>
<p>— 楊彥岐</p>
<p>提起「書生」，總覺得是一個「白面孔」。所以，我恨「書生」這兩個字！並不是覺得「白面孔」侮辱人類，而覺得「白面孔」實在可恥。</p>
<p>我一向看不起「小白臉」者之流，不但看不起，我還恨透了「白面」。但是不幸自已是搖筆桿子的圈中人，似乎與「書生」略有牽涉，因此又有自身的關係，不由得更憎惡「白面」。</p>
<p>書生是最沒有用的一種人，巳經被某一部分愛下斷論的人所公認了，而我呢，還略存倔强的壞脾氣，不肯低頭受刑，還要掙扎出一兩句口號來。我覺得天下事沒有如此容易斷定的，就是「書生」也會有用。幸虧，憾謝上帝，有人立下論調，證明筆桿有槍桿同樣的力量。這樣，我才破涕為笑，睡得着覺。</p>
<p>不過因此我史恨「白面」。</p>
<p>我們試把筆桿槍桿比較一下看，拿槍桿的人不是「白面」，為什麽提筆桿的人該與「白面」有緣？如果天下書生都是白面，那末文章就永遠在後花園私訂終身這個圈子上繞來繞去。我們耍提筆代槍，也嬰鬥爭，也要有堡壘的功能；不能躱在後花園里踱着方步。</p>
<p>所謂「文人」，好像不是指「寫文章的人」，而是指手舞縛鷄之力的斯文一人。所以，幾千年流傳下來的觀念，使「寫文章的人」手無縛鷄之力，至於筆重千鈞，也不過文人吹牛的形容句子而巳。</p>
<p>「書生」應該趕快避開「白面」，不能冉受這種奇恥大辱了。要雪恥，耍翻身，要把筆桿奪到與槍桿同等高低的地位。</p>
<p>實在憑良心說，「白面書生」也不是無理的辭句。不是嗎，多少搖筆桿的人，永遠躱在房間里，面孔不遇到太陽光，皮膚也接觸不到戶外空氣。只是伏在書桌上，埋在書堆里，搖筆，哼吟；那里再會有生氣呢？難怪「白面」「彎背」都成了書生的特徵。而書生的產品却也、永遠脫不了醫桌，書堆。偶爾有一點幻想，也不過是書桌上，書堆里的白日夢。</p>
<p>我們應該「自知」，「人豈不自知」？旣自知就該向要走的那條路邁步前進。有人說「欲速則不達」，是的，可是欲達則要走，不走又何嘗能達呢？大家守着一條窄路，大家擠在同一個模型中；其實祇是老鼠躦牛角，死路一條。所以，試走出家門，離開書齋，跑到廣大的世界里去開開眼界吧！</p>
<p>「白面書生」的護身符：「為文藝而文藝」，已經被人認為不健全而有矛盾性的了；允其現在，更不能再墨守這句莫名其妙的話，而作為自已不睜眼的辯護辭。</p>
<p>雖然不敢希望馬上能怎樣「狂飈突進」，但是至少希望「書生」與「白面」能脫離關係。</p>
<p>願中國文人，都是身强力壯，飽經磨折的戰士！</p>
<h3>南宋陳亮的恢復失地論</h3>
<p>— 杰</p>
<p>——讀史隨筆——</p>
<p>歷史上的文獻，可算是前人遺給後人的一份最貴重的遺產。這些文獻，並不是徒供後人欣賞嗟嘆的古董，而是前人經騐的結晶，給予後人極深刻的敎訓。醫如說；抗戰以後，蔣委員長所歷次發表的言論，不但在目前有極重大的意義，即在百年千年之後，在歷史上仍有其不可磨滅的價值。這裹我預備介紹一篇歷史上的重要文獻，就是南宋時陳亮所呈獻給宋孝宗的「恢復之議」。</p>
<p>陳　是南宋初年的婺州人，他所生的時候，正當宋朝遭受金人的侵略。大江以北，大部份淪陷在敵人手中；南宋的皇帝，又聽信幾個佞臣的主和論，只知道苟安因循，全沒有收復失地的志向。於是陳亮在宋孝宗時，四决上疏，請求勵精圖治，以復興民族；並請討伐金人，以收復失地。文長數萬言，洋洋灑灑，的確是千古以來少有的奇文！</p>
<p>全文的要旨，大概有三層。第一層說明抗戰的有和，議和的有弊。為什麽要抗戰呢？因為要拯救淪陷區內受苦的民衆，要洗雪國家所遭受的恥辱，要迎還徽欽二帝的棺柩，要收回失去的國土。陳亮的原文是：「赤子嗷嗷無告，不可以不拯；國家憑陵之恥，不可以不雪；陵寢不可以不還；與地不可以不復。」因為有這四個「不可不」的理由，所以一定要抗戰！陳亮又以為不趁早收回失地，則日子一久，恐怕沒有收回的希望了！他說：「南渡已久，中原父老，日以殂謝，生長於戎，豈知有我？」這就是說。，「現在淪陷區裏的同胞，還知道懷念祖國；將來小輩長大，恐怕受敵人的奴化敎育，决不會再想起祖國了！」這話說得多麼有理！只消看看目前，不是有許多台灣士兵，在攻打他們的祖國麼？陳亮又舉出一個絕妙的譬喻，他說：「以俚俗論之，父祖質產於人，子孫不能繼贖，更數十年，時事一變，皆自陳於官，認為故產。我安得言質而復取之？則今日之事，（即收復失地之事）可得而更緩乎？」這譬喩何等確切，試看朝鮮台灣本是我國領土，現在失陷了數十年，在國際上也沒有一國再承認這是中國的領土；中國的地理敎科醫，也不再把朝鮮台灣列入本國版圖之內。這樣看來，我們的東四省，應該趁早收回，不容再緩了！</p>
<p>第二層是論攻守的地勢，他以為東南一隅不足恃，必須爭取荊襄之地。第三層是論一般專講「性理」的學者，不切實用不合時宜。他說：「今世之儒士自以為得正心誠意之學者，皆瘋痺不知痛癢之人也！舉一世安於君父之仇，而方低頭拱手，以談性命，不知何者謂之性命乎？」這一駡駡得多末爽快！所以當時朱熹也認為陳亮的言論是「在悖之談」。不過平心而論，理學雖無補於抗戰，但尙不失為個人修身的規範。目前抗戰時間內，尙有人拿「色情文章」賞錢，那纔夠罵一聲「瘋痺不知痛癢之人也」了。</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>『我看陳鎭長不是這種人，他的出任「維持會」會長，也許別有隱情，我們倒不可寃枉了他。現在我想回去看看我那邊的木行，順使想探探他的口風，看他是吾出自本心。』</p>
<p>葉團長覺得道話倒也不錯，不過他很怕蔡和贊昧於大義，去了不再回來，便剴切地對他說了一番在游擊區裏和敵人不合作運動的重要性。蔡和豐笑着說：</p>
<p>『這個我知道，我雖然是生意人，却也懂得國家民族的大道理，决不會昧着良心，去和敵人合作的。並且要是陳鎭長的出仟「維持會」會長不是木心，我還想和他商量，怎樣裏應外合的來收復合浦鎭呢。』</p>
<p>葉團長非常歡喜，他又可囑蔡和豐，呌他小心，勿上敵人的圈套，一有機會就趕快回來。</p>
<p>果然不出蔡和豐所料，陳鎭長的出面担任偽「維持會」會長並非本心，而是被强迫出來的。原來在×軍進攻合浦鎭的時候，陳鎭長本來也想帶着全家逃避，誰知他的女兒秀月，却是個葉團長的崇拜者，一口咬定合浦鎭决不會被×軍攻下。陳鎭長是個忠厚老實人，沒有主意，也就「一動不如一靜」的，沒有走避。想不到合浦鎮在當天就陷落了，滿街都是×軍，要逃避已來不及，只好杜門不出，表示從此不預外事。可是人的名兒，樹的影兒，×方早已看中了他這負全鎮車望的人，最適合他們理想中的傀儡資格，所以他儘管要杜門，×方却偏要登門。</p>
<p>陳鎭長起初倒也大節凜然，不肯答應做一維持會」會長，無奈×方的宣撫班長威迫的手段非常厲害，他看穿了陳鎭長是個無用的老實人，便施出他們一貫的作風，不斷的對他恫嚇說，要是他不肯答應，便要問他通「匪」的罪名，不但沒收他財產，還要殺戮他全家。在這樣的威迫之下，凍鎭長為保自己身家性命的安全起見，不得不違反本心而勉强答應了。</p>
<p>誰知他雖答應出任「維持會」偽職，却仍不能保身家的安全。獨眼李又看中了他的女兒秀月，居然派人來向他提親。陳鎮長怎肯把自己花朶似的女兒下嫁匪人，自然一口拒絕。獨眼李懷恨在心，便在×方的宣撫班長面前，誇說秀月怎樣的美麗，×方的宜撫班長原是個好色之徒，便親來向陳鎮長求婚。陳鎭長暗暗驚訝，只好用「齊大非偶」的話來拒絕，可是×方的宣撫班長却另有一套新名詞，他口口聲聲說這是「東亞恊同體」，是「×支結合」的先聲，終於片面地委下聘禮走了，並且聲明兩天後就要迎娶。</p>
<p>這消息傳到了秀月耳裏，不禁又氣又苦，哀哀地哭泣了一夜。她雖然沒有見過葉團長，可是她父親常常在她面前提起，她的一顆心早放在葉團長身上了，後來說親沒有成功，她心裏暗暗有些失望，及至打聽得葉團長拒婚的原因，是抱着「匈奴未滅何以家為」的宗旨，便不但不怨他寡情，反而更對他增加了敬愛的情緒。她日夜禱祝漪抗戰早日勝利地結束，好遂她百年偕老的私願。誰知大變之來，出於意料，眼見得置身在這鬼魅橫行的環境裏，總無法避免狼虎的蹂躪，倒不如趁早結束了自已的生命，才可以保全淸白的身體。於是，便趁夜裹大家熟睡的時候，她悄悄把一條索子繫在橫樑上，上弔死了。（三九）</p>

<h3>「五族共和」</h3>
<p>— 慕傑</p>
<p>廢棄的五色旗又被搬出了，並且順帶牽出一個名詞是「五族共和」。這又是同「親善」「提携」差不多，聽來很動人的好名詞。據說內容是：「中國」人有五個大族，大家和和氣氣，聯合一起，為東亞和平努力，不要受人煽惑，誤入歧途。</p>
<p>「五族共和」自是好名詞；不過這內容是據說的，眞相如何，却是全世界人士所共睹。威脅，利誘，挑撥，離間，促使五族不和，內鬨閱牆，這眞是侵略者的慣技，明明使五族不和，偏說五族共和，何則？欲以一手掩盡天下目也。然則偽「滿洲國」，偽「內蒙政府」，偽「臨時政府」，偽「維新政府」，名目如此繁多，欲說不是使五族分裂，而是使五族共和，誰相信？</p>
<p>相反的，欲使五族不和的手段，適足促使五族在砲火洗禮下，走上融融洩洩，萬衆一心之路：蒙族王公曾南下請纓抗戰，回族領袖亦表示擁護政府，卽使苗族也同仇敵愾，願為抗戰前驅。最近又有川靑接壞處夷民，二百餘年未來省謁，特推舉代表，進謁川省當局，請纓抗戰。這是鐵一般的事實：告訴侵略者說，中國已無所謂五族之分，凡中國人民，都已團結起來，彼此一家，同心戮力，共禦外侮。毒辣的手段，决不會再攪亂五族間感情，五族是眞正的融結了，這正是抗戰洪爐中的寳貴收護。</p>
<p>在侵略者本意，原想藉「五族共和」的美名，冀圖實現其野心迷夢；不料五族竟眞的共和了，不但共和，而且變成一家，不分彼此，這正給予侵略者一個有力的反手巴掌！</p>
<h3>保管箱</h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>在資本中義最發展的上海，銀行裏附設的保管箱，似乎已成了一種極重要的必需品；它在富豪的階級中，價值的確高於衣，食，住，三項，祇要是稍有一點私產的人，必然的就要向銀行裏租用一隻保管箱，以資儲藏。所以，上海各大小銀行，幾乎都有這一個部門的組設，有高大行屋建築的是更無論矣。</p>
<p>在「八一三」之前，向銀行裏租用一隻保管箱，非但手續簡便，而且租費又低廉，租用全年也僅數元代價而巳。可是現在呢？在上海欲找一隻保管箱，其困難和在找房屋的困難是相等了，即使託人輾轉設法，也難租得。道原因，是很明顯的，因為戰後各地的富豪，甚至小康，都把共私產寄托於上海那些鋼質的保管箱中，藉避竄外；以致上海這麼多的銀行，這麼多的保管箱，還是供不敷求。道種畸形的發展，就是各游擊區的一切私人所有的動產的物力（金銀錢幣鑽寳有價證劵等等）都已集中於「孤島」的表示。旣可保存自已的財力，復可避免資敵，擴大點說，上海的保管箱，在抗戰和國民經濟上也有些許助力。</p>
<p>它因為有堅厚的鋼質和水泥建築的庫為總衛，有製造精巧的箱鎖為內衛，對於盜竊，火燒等遭遇，可處之泰然；並且，每一箱的租用人和行方各執鑰匙一柄，須共同會開，始能應用（內部物件　方不加顧問）。因此，旣可免錯誤，又可保守私產的秘密，它有這樣的效用，以之儲藏私產自然是萬無一失了。</p>
<p>但是，上海的保管箱，現在却有一大半是被一般投機者和對於幣制缺乏認識與信仰的自私份子利用着；它裏面所儲藏的東西，大多係金銀硬「貨」，非但於國家無益，而且，在金融上和幣制的機構上却有相當的影響。投機者的買進賣出，固不自　日始，姑勿置論。然而一般少數富豪們收藏金條，銀塊，英美等國的金磅票，香港票，法郞票，新加坡票，外滙，國外有價證券等等，總是戰後的現象，允其是上海被加上了「孤島」的雅號，市塲失去了統制，產生了所謂黑「市塲」以後，一般富翁們都在自私的觀念下儲藏着這些「硬貨」。今天買幾條黃金，若干外幣，偷偷摸摸往保管箱中一藏，明天再收買若干又往保管箱中一藏，這樣日積月累，那些保管箱中就不知道儲藏了多少「黃白物」。目前金價在漲的原因，也禾始沒有一部份是因為收藏過量吧？</p>
<p>這些「硬貨」及「外幣一，在抗戰時期是有關民族經濟命脈的東西，穩定幣制和外匯都要仗它的力量，現在竟然使它纍纍的藏在保管箱中，不出來為國發揮其效能，他們存着覆巢下的完卵的想念固然耍不得，而保管箱正是做了促進他們這種想念的工具。</p>
<p>不過，保管箱被人作種種利用，却也不獨是上海而巳。近日閱報載：香港中西各銀行的保管箱也被租用一空，匯豐銀行並且從今年起增加保管箱千隻，租用費也酌增了若干，還是供不應求。這種盛况，雖有不少富豪儲藏財寳，但是，恐怕也有不少是和上海一樣的，被一般人租作畸形的利用吧</p>

<h3>時間服務報告</h3>
<p>— 糊塗</p>
<p>她迅速地報告不同的　　秒　同時警告你生命是　　　消逝</p>
<p>在我們一天中，那個問題問得最多，而且那個問題的回答須隨時間的轉移而不同？</p>
<p>「現在是什麼時候？」「哈辰光？」</p>
<p>用電話去問時間，在這個時代也是一件新奇而便利的事。數世紀前，我們有日晷儀—希臘的發明物，今日我們有電話時計，只須手指一撥，上海與其他大都市一樣，有時間服務處，「九五六七八」是牠的電話號碼。他能告訴你這個麻煩的問題：「什麼時候？」在上海這時間報告服務，要較其他都市要麻煩些，因為他至少須用二種言語－中語與英語來報告。</p>
<p>假使我們撥了「九五六七八」，那就接到時間服務間－牠就設在福建路四六〇號電話公司要一間特別播音室，一個中國女郞坐在播音器面前，目不轉睛地注視着時鐘，每間五秒鐘，她就機械式地用中英語報告準確的時間。</p>
<p>讓我們來注意她一下，她很舒服而安逸的坐在靠椅上，雖然須有嚴肅的姿勢及敏捷的頭腦。她凝視着時鐘，卽使我們進去，也不能吸引她的注意，她簡直什麼東西都忘記了，只凝視着時針在鐘面上兜圈子。看上去她是多麼安靜；但她不像藝術家的「模特兒」，她是一個活潑的呆子，也是一個笨呆的演戲者。</p>
<p>她的聲音是低緩，平穩，淸晰，同一語調，一遍又一遍地，送入播音器，她迅速地報告不同的時，分，秒，但她同時也重複地警告你可怖的事實－生命是無情地消逝。</p>
<p>每報告十五分鐘掉換一人，這個換班是必需的，因為欲避免細微的錯誤。在長期集中注意下，錯報是不可免的，因為這種工作是單調而乏味。</p>
<p>可是這個電話，只能由發音者給受話者，因此她不能聽到你的話，你也不能說聲：「謝謝」，這原因的特點是因為一發聲其他的人就能同時聽到。</p>
<p>還有一件有趣的事，是一盞紅燈是始終亮着，只要有一人在聽。在沒有人問的時候，就熄滅了，因此她們可以免去不必要的報告，得有幾秒鐘休息</p>
<p>無疑的，時間服務，在每個電話用戶心目中認為非常便利而感激，因為不分畫夜的服務，據最近的調查，在二十四小時，就有六千三百八十决去問時間的。摘譯字林西報</p>
<h3>民族英雄開篇</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>（二）王知縣</p>
<p>無錫縣，本來是個士城，隔了年代久遠，就大半坍塌了。明朝嘉靖三十三年的時候，日本兵騷擾江浙各省，王知縣曉得了，立刻打算改築石頭城，呌他兒子克寳去監工，畫夜不停的工作。有一般工人，要求休息，王公子哀憐他，允許暫時休息，恰巧王知縣來巡查，大加震怒，察出情形，就把他兒子斬首。那築城工匠和許多將士，沒有一個不胆戰心驚，後來六十多天，就造成一座堅城。等到日本兵來，圍困了一個月，敵兵解散，百姓安全，無錫人感謝王知縣，在惠山上建立生祠，並且造一座長橋，紀念王公子，就呌他克寳橋哩。抗日英雄著盛名，王知縣血戰保孤城。記得那，明朝嘉靖年間事，騷擾江南有倭×兵，無錫縣舊屬蘇州府，城郭原來是堆圭成。日本大兵來迫壓，無錫人個個胆心驚。當年有個賢知縣，王其動三字記分明。建築石城防大敵，尅日興工賴衆擎。晝夜不停工作苦，筋疲力盡喊連聲。王家公子名克寳，監工辛苦到三更。衆工人哀求王公子，偸閒片刻要鑒愚誠。由來公子心慈善，允許工人暫息停。縣長巡查到城下，見工人鼾睡像雷轟。衝冠發怒心如火，究出眞情更怒不平。可憐那，鐵面無私的王知縣，愛兒犧牲竟正典刑。守城將士魂飛散，工匠人入胆戰兢。漏夜加工纔兩月，石頭一座眼前呈。×兵無法攻城入，保境安民雞犬寗。至今克寳橋長在，無限傷心思古情，忠魂長共惠泉淸。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第六回　誇人瑞一功挺三秀　敘友情二士會羣英</p>
<p>何家兩位小姐，也知道這位章醫師，是個守貞不字的老處女，也是朱愛人的義母。朱愛人所以得有今天這一日，全是那位老章醫師把她栽培起來的。而這個醫院的發達，育嬰院的創辦，以及這個安樂鎭的繁盛，也全是這位老章醫師之功。因此對於她，也非常敬佩。那天朱愛人便引領她們去看為她們兩人預備的房間。房間雖小，却收拾得很為精潔，好在就在朱愛人房間隔壁，隨時可以晤談。到了吃夜飯時候，連老章醫師在內，一桌也有七八人，她們吃得也很儉的。其中有幾位女醫師，也是住在老章醫師一宅的。有一位劉問秋女醫師，是婦科的主仟醫師，今年四十多歲了，也是從前在美國畢業的。這位劉醫師，却是老章醫師的表妹，也沒有嫁過人的。有一位葉初靑女醫師，是兒科的主任醫師，年的三十歲光景，她在英國畢業的。這位葉醫師，她的丈夫，也是一位名醫師，而且巳經一男一女，生了兩個小孩子。這兩個小孩子，全在此間育嬰院裏。他們夫婦兩人，各從事於醫業。每年只有暑假休息時間，他們要在水木明瑟之區，山林空曠之間，休憇兩個月，過他們的雙棲生活。老章醫師給他們兩人說笑話，說「你們好像是牛郞織女，到那個時候，要鵲橋相會了。不過天上雙星，鵲橋相會，只有一晌，你們却要兩個月，未免敎牛郞織女妒羨了。而且人家新婚以後，度一次蜜月，像你們那樣，好似年年要　兩個月蜜月咧一。的確，葉初靑女醫師所生的一男一女兩個孩子，都在這個暑假蜜月中得胎的。生了這兩個孩子以後，還有小姊妹們問她道：『葉醫師！你們每年暑假裏，可以有一位公子，或是一位小姐，那未每年一度，就可以得到不少的男女公子咧。』葉初靑醫師微笑道：『够了！我巳有一男一女，便足够了。倘然我們要有四個小孩子，由四個而生八個，由八個而生十六個，這樣的倍數加上去，那一傳幾代，可就不得了呢。所以我們的牛殖進行，到此戞然而止了。』果然她的男孩子是六歲，女孩子是四歲，以後便沒有生育過。（六七）</p>

<h3>抗戰與游藝</h3>
<p>— 金丁</p>
<p>抗戰到達了第二階段，離開「最後勝利」的路程，是越走越近了。在這「最後勝利」行將來臨的緊要關頭，除了忠勇衛國，浴血抗戰的全體將士，應該加緊他們的鬥爭外，全國各界，也應該在最高領袖指導之下，一致的努力。當然，站在時代前面的游藝界，無疑的，更加要負荷起較大的責任了。</p>
<p>就筆者的眼光看來，在抗戰過程中的游藝界，除了全體從業員，應該努力奉行中央最近頒佈的精神總動員中，十二條「國民公約」外，更應該在從事工作的時候，儘可能的穿揷些關於抗戰建國的材料，以刺激一般觀衆的心靈，提高觀衆的情緒，增加觀衆對於「最後勝利」必能達到的信心。使每個觀衆，都有「抗戰必勝」「建國必成」的信念。這種精神上的建設，和抗戰的前途，是有着極重大的關係和影響的。</p>
<p>除此之外，如電影界對於抗戰電影的攝製，應加倍努力。上海的環境，固然艱苦，誠然不容許含有抗戰性的電影的開映；然而，我們却可以把這種影片，送到內地去公映。因為電影在抗戰文化運動中，是一個最通俗最有力的武器。內地的民衆，是多麼的需要這種電影，來增加他們的抗戰情緒呀。至於戲劇界，話劇界，今後除了努力於本身的公演工作外，對於含有抗戰性的新劇本的製作，也應加倍努力；其他如平劇，說書等等的改良運動，也是迫不容緩的事。希望就本身可能範圍內，對抗戰工作，多多盡些責任。</p>
<p>總之，抗戰需要游藝，游藝也不忘抗戰，要有不可分離的關係的。游藝界同人，其勉之哉。</p>
<h3>談幾位京派的名琴師（上）</h3>
<p>— 秋君</p>
<p>京劇的胡琴，是一種與歌唱不可須臾離的主要音樂。因為演員的歌唱，除去崑曲或吹腔以外，都需要胡琴的襯托。一般名伶莫不各據私房琴師以資輔助自己，這裹先介紹幾位京派的有名琴師，想亦琴迷讀者所願聞焉。</p>
<p>徐蘭沅是梅博士的琴師，手音異常圓潤，能崑曲極多，隨畹華多年，不但精於襯托旦角，對於老生亦有相當的研究。曾憶十年前北平梨園公會演窩窩頭賑災戲有余叔岩與畹華之遊龍戲鳳及打漁殺家，彼時即由蘭沅代余操琴，「昨夜晚吃酒醉……」一段西皮快三眼，蘭沅之襯托可謂美不勝收，是誠天衣無縫，嘆聽止矣。生平除操琴外，並於故都琉璃廠創設竹蘭軒」出售南方斑竹，並亦自製胡琴出售，其待人接物，尤謙恭和藹無梨園氣，復工書，有求必應，人恒稱之曰「徐大爺」。</p>
<p>王少卿是老伶工王鳳卿的令郎，隨畹華奏二胡倚之如左右臂，幼習老生後改業琴，指峰剛脆，腕力過人，自創一格鳴於世，人稱為「王派」今之操二胡者，莫不追從之。試一聆畹華之唱片或舞台戲劇，即可領略其玄妙，畹華之腔調，多出其與姜妙香研究所得者。梅劇團塲面人員無不受其指揮，更為其父及弟（王幼卿）操胡琴，如文昭關，戰長沙，硃砂痣等劇，弓法之快慢，托腔之幽揚，可稱一絕。又與其弟操琴時，不用二胡，在塲上隨意抖弄，再加以喬三之鼓，使人聆之心曠神怡，大江南北，無不知其名者，以排行居二，又呼之曰「二片兒」。</p>
<p>楊寶忠先唱老生，為人掛刀充二牌，後改業琴，拜錫子剛先生為師，隨馬連良將近七年，其指法乾凈俐落，腕力亦有過人處，台下人緣極佳，上塲常得碰頭好，對連良之腔調，襯托極嚴，唱工托工，唱合托台，雖氣口之微，其弓法亦隨之頓挫有方，可稱為一把科學化的胡琴，較連良以前之琴師趙桂元善用裹腔法適成反比，現亦製琴出售，又對於西樂亦有研究。尙小雲曩演摩登伽女時，常倩其操「梵亞鈴」更以擊鼓駡曹之「漁陽三撾」鼓法稱於世，寳忠可謂多材多藝矣。</p>
<h3>書塲情報</h3>
<p>— 聿脩</p>
<p>怡苑書塲塲東，前因塲址過窄，影響營業非小。近已租定福建路廣東路口萬商茶樓之三層樓全部，闢為書塲新址，地方寬大，座位遂得大加擴充。除「日夜面」全做外，（在怡苑時只做「夜面」）並擬增開「早擋」書，以與匯泉，大中角逐。所「扳」先生，類多「響擋」，陣容極為「紮硬」，佈置就緒，即可開書。</p>
<p>普餘社今年因社員在滬者不多，所以「塲子」極少。近有向蘇錫方面，招呼社員，增闢上海書塲同邑廟市塲之百花廳茶室為新地盤之說。</p>
<p>雅廬「夜面」楊筱亭父子擋之白蛇，珠聯璧合，極受聽客歡迎，號召力量極大。張鳳翔父子擋因新書（戰地鶯花錄）聽客不一受」，遂又重新改唱「玉蜻蜓」。</p>
<p>新閘路之鳳嗚台書塲，「日面」「扳」張鴻聲做「一擋頭」，時間賣鈿，均極經濟，上座不壞，因而張鴻聲之「飛機英烈」遂又得大走紅運云。</p>
<p>吳小松小石弟兄，久已不在上海書塲漏臉，聞巳去平津鬻技，周玉泉蔣月庭近亦得瀋陽某某函邀做「長堂差」，報酬除供給膳宿外，月俸二百元，臨時短堂差同其他零星「外快」生意，並可隨意接受，不加限止。滙泉樓「剪刀書」後，周蔣擋頗有北上可能。</p>
<p>富春目「夜面」「扳」得描王夏荷生後，營業果然大有轉機，近日每天都好賣「三百碗」；惟「日面」仍只七八十。</p>
<p>南市偽組織，近為繁榮市面起見，督促城隍廟各書塲復業。雖有一二不肖塲東，接受此種提議，但來租界「扳」先生時，均遭碰壁，無一成局云。</p>
<p>在好萊塢，似眞似幻的玩意可不少呢。這裏是“Wuthering　Heights”中的一個鏡頭：兒奧蓓朗（Merle　Oberon）和亞力山大科達（Alexander　Korda）結婚了。在曼兒奧蓓朗未婚夫底苦惱的監視之下，來賓們都向他們擲灑花綵，眞要不得！攝好了這個「結婚照」之後，曼兒和科達便溜進了演員更衣室。科達笑了，曼兒底神情郤非常嚴肅。</p>
<h3>貢格廷</h3>
<p>— 其</p>
<p>詩人吉百齡的名著「貢格廷」，雖然已有了四十七年的歷史；然而他那一股壯盛的氣概，到現在還是深深地印在人們的腦間，所以這部書的銷路始終也沒有减少過，這正是文學上的巨製！雷電華公司見到了這一點，就把他改編成電影。耗資巨萬，以極度的財力人力把這片成功了電影上的巨製！</p>
<p>單講佈景，這塲面占了一塊極廣的區域，正是浩浩乎平原無垠！那裏有峻惡的山路，奇險的峰嶺。再講演員，那是一張戰爭的片子，有幾幕不用槍，不用刀：赤手空拳，於是善鬥的三位演員，卡雷葛倫，維多麥克勞倫，小范朋克三個生龍活虎的明星就施出他們全身的解數來演了。</p>
<p>我似乎不相信有這樣好的文章能把那首史詩的故事很簡短地叙述出來。所以只能把一個故事的輪廓講一講。這是說在印度有一種非常令人恐怖的民族。非常悍勇善鬥，他們相信一種慘酷的宗敎。被殺戮的人數很多很多。於是英國駐印軍隊連同印度本地軍隊協力把這一個民族消滅了。裏面告訴三個生死同心的同曹的冒險故事，和一個印度孩子的殺身成仁的壯舉。在這裏有民族與民族間生存的惡戰，有為印度階級制度喊不平的呼聲。還有印度地理的險隘，駐軍生活的狀况。更有許多幽默的笑料在極度緊張的空氣裏調和着。</p>
<p>此片巳定今日起在本埠南京大戲院公映，是足以掩蔽好萊塢一九二八年全年出品光芒　作品</p>
<h3>游藝新聞</h3>
<p>影城記攝竣</p>
<p>宣傳多時的「影城記」巳全部結束，以攝影塲為題材的影片，這可算是第一部，路明在該片中由剪片生而躍登紅星寳座，後來跳二十四層樓自殺，頗見緊張熱烈。「神秘夫人」工作得相當起勁，文逸民在這部片中，預料一定「出摜頭」，同時更值得一提的，女名票在慧姑所飾女刺客一角，巳經開拍，成績十分驚人。傻大姐倉隱秋近常保護其外子小王至藝華，緣小王在「神秘夫人」中有重要演出也。貂斑華去冬一度臥病，經靜養月餘，巳告復原，其新作為王决龍導演之四魔土」。「燕子李三」女主角，業已確定為汪洋余琳嚴月閒，又王元龍小姨陸美小姐，也將在這片中一穿一穿一，實在電影界很需要新人。據方沛霖報告，暫休片刻，然後動手「二集化身姑娘「袁美雲雌婆雄的演技，又要拿出來了。</p>

<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（一二六）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>按探母的出關說到西太後與安得海的關係</p>
<p>按照「探母」的戲詞講起，如「淚在在哭出了雁門關」等句，總是說楊四郞所過的這個關是雁門關，多少年唱下來，都是如此的。其實那眞與戲情不合，而且時間上，地理上，全弄擰啦。據「辭源」上解釋「遼。朝代名，姓耶律氏，初名契丹，後改為遼，居熱河」。又云「雁門，郡名，本戰國趙地，秦晉郡，今山西舊代州，寗武之北部，及朔平南部，大同東部北部，皆其境」。山海經云：「雁門，飛雁出其問，亦曰陘嶺，自雁門以南，謂之陘南。以北謂之陘北，東西山巖峭拔，中有路，盤旋崎嶇，絕頂置關，謂之西陘關，亦曰雁門關，自古為戍守重地，與寗武，偏頭。為山西三關，所謂外三關也。關城傍山就險，屹為巨防」。再如辭源解釋古北口云：「古北口，地名，在京兆密雲縣東北，兩崖壁立，僅通一車，為內地往蒙古之要道，淸時直隸提督駐此」。</p>
<p>我們先把「雁門關」「古北口」及熱河　省城「承德」這幾個地方的步位弄淸楚啦，（並繪圖說明）這個關的問題就容易解决了。</p>
<p>四郞坐宮的時候，他和公主無論在唱詞及唸白中，都表現出他們是同居皇宮內院的；復證以「芍藥開牡丹放花紅一片」的劇詞，及上朝盜令的塲子，又可知蕭太后與駙馬公主等，統統是身在遼京承德，並未像「宋王御駕到北塞（佘太君唱詞）」似的，離開京城，到前綫來啦。從這兩點上看來，再證以「快馬加鞭一夜還」的唱詞，我們就可斷定四郞所過的這個關，必定離承德的距離很近，所以他才敢毅然向公主說道：「五鼓天明即刻還」。倘要是有個一兩千里的路程，恐怕四郞所騎的馬就是像　雨墩盜的御馬那樣的快，（白走一千見日，夜走八百不明），那也是來不及飛回遼京，趕在五鼓上朝時交令的。但是我們照上面的地圖上對照研究一下，雁門關旣是隸屬代州境內，與寗武偏頭同為晋省三關，那麼，承德距離雁門，中間除去隔開一個察省外，還得加上由察邊到承德中間的這一段路途。</p>

The Chinese army, with its fortified positions and effective concealment, suffered minimal casualties. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wànjiābù: Fierce fighting has raged along the Xiū River for four days and nights. The Japanese army's offensive north of Tūjiābù has been particularly fierce.

Currently, the Chinese army has entered its most fortified positions, and the Japanese army is unlikely to succeed. (21st Dispatch)</p>

The fiercest battles are taking place on the front, north of Tūjiābù, in the Guānyīngé Mountains, Xiàcūn, and Chéncūn areas. Japanese soldiers have suffered heavy casualties, and the situation has reached a stalemate. Chéncūn has been lost and regained four or five times and is currently still under the control of the Chinese army. A small detachment of Japanese soldiers from Liúzhuāng, southeast of Qiújīn, raided Liàojiā on the south bank on the morning of the 21st.

<p>Yuánqū: Over a thousand Japanese soldiers entrenched in Fúshān have been under constant attack by the Chinese army in recent days. On the afternoon of the 17th, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack from Tiāntánlǐ, Yáomìao, the southwest slopes of Yìtǎ, and Zhūgě Village in Chāngyìtǎ, converging on the Japanese army in Fúshān. After three hours of intense fighting, the Japanese army was unable to withstand the pressure and fled towards Línfén.

<p>(Yíchāng) The Japanese army in central Húběi feels threatened by the large Chinese army defending the Hán River. They have recently constructed fortifications along the Xiāng River, appearing to be preparing for a long-term defense. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yuánqū: The Japanese army in Ānzé once launched an eastward offensive but was repelled by the Chinese army and has since disappeared without a trace. Currently, the Chinese army has begun a counterattack against this Japanese army. There have been continuous engagements near Ānzé in recent days. The Chinese army has already advanced to the outskirts of Ānzé and is currently encircling and suppressing them. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chóngqìng) According to Chinese sources, Japanese troops near Luóhàn Temple on the east bank of the Xiāng River in Húběi Province crossed the river at two points on the night of the 18th of this month, attempting to invade Shāyáng, east of Shāshì. Fierce fighting is currently underway in this area. Fighting has also broken out on the northern front of Jiāngxī Province. The Japanese army crossed the Xiū River at two points on the night of the 17th of this month, intending to invade Nánchāng from the south. (Reuters, 21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Xīngjí: The two detachments of the Japanese Yamaguchi command stationed in Dàwǔzhèn, totaling 400 infantry and artillerymen, are hastily building bunkers to the west and north of the village. According to refugees who escaped from the mountains west of the village, the Japanese plan to launch a three-pronged offensive northwards towards Línxiàn within days. On the evening of the 19th, the Chinese army destroyed over ten li of roads connecting Dàwǔ to the mountains east and west of the village and demolished dozens of telephone poles. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Xīngjí: A small detachment of Japanese troops from Jìnglè, along with over a thousand Japanese reinforcements from Kāngjiāhuì, under the cover of three planes and three artillery pieces, harassed Yàntān and Wǔmǎsì from the Fànjiāgōu and Hénglín Pícūn areas, starting at 8:00 AM on the morning of the 17th. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, Yàntān and Wǔmǎsì were invaded by the Japanese army. The Chinese army is still conducting separate attacks. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Xīngjí: Three to four hundred Japanese troops from Líshí launched a three-pronged offensive on the 17th. One force circled around the right flank of the Chinese army from Zhāngjiāshān, another advanced towards Zǎolín Village from Shílǐ Village, and the third circled around the left flank of the Chinese army from Chénjiāzhuāng. By noon, they had raided Zǎo Village and were engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army near Zhuāngzishàng. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Xīngjí: On the 17th, a squadron of Chinese aircraft, numbering [blank] planes, flew over Línfén, circling for a long time without dropping any bombs. The Japanese army in the city was greatly alarmed and moved to villages in the northeast suburbs. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Xīngjí: In order to facilitate the invasion of Yúmén, the Japanese army has decided to extend the Tóngpú railroad to Hétīn County. Construction has already begun from Hóumǎ, heading west. A certain unit of the Chinese army has dispatched a certain detachment, crossing west of the railroad to cooperate with local armed civilians in active resistance, preventing the completion of the Japanese plan. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Attempt to Spy on Eastern Zhèjiāng; Continuous Discussions in Hongkǒu, Repeated Bombardment Outside the Town of Zhènhǎi</h3>
<p>(Níngbō) Four Japanese warships docked in the town bombarded fiercely again at 1:00 PM on the 20th. Until 3:00 PM, they fired 116 shells. Four warships also arrived from Yáo Línsān at 11:00 AM and fired over ten shells towards the shore. (Special Dispatch, 20th) The French-language Shanghai Journal reported that it has recently been heard that the Japanese side has been holding continuous discussions in Hongkǒu. It is said that what they are discussing is clearly a plan unfavorable to Níngbō. According to news revealed by the Japanese side, Níngbō is an important town south of the Hangzhou Bay, communicating with Jīnhuá, the current capital of Zhèjiāng Province. Politically and economically, it has become an important hub for transportation between the Chinese interior and Shanghai. It is also claimed that there are currently 200,000 Chinese soldiers gathered near Níngbō, conducting guerrilla warfare against the Japanese defense lines and threatening to encircle Hangzhou. According to the Japanese understanding of the deployment of the Chinese army, there are currently six divisions deployed in Shàoxīng and Tónglú, pressing towards Hangzhou.

<h3>Japanese Army Lands Near Dōngzhōu</h3>
<p>A certain location in Western Zhèjiāng: Approximately one hundred Japanese soldiers from the area of Língjiāqiáo south of Zhōujiāpǔ (12 kilometers east of Fúyáng), using forty rubber boats, landed near Dōngzhōu (a sandbar south of Zhōujiāpǔ) in the Fùchūn River at dawn today.

<h3>Chinese Army Attacks Yánglóusī, People Assist Greatly</h3>
<p>(Chángshā) During the Chinese army's attack on Yánglóusī last month, the area was once occupied. According to a certain commander who led the attack on Yánglóusī, when his troops approached Yánglóusī, they still had to cross a small river ten meters wide. Although engineers had built a temporary bridge in advance, the muddy conditions after the rain made it difficult for the large army to pass. Fortunately, while the engineers were working, someone passing by the bridge noticed this shortcoming. Under the leadership of a person surnamed Rèn, everyone gathered rice straw and tied it together, placing it horizontally on the slopes above and below the nail bridge, creating several steps. When the main force passed, even though it was during the continuous spring rain, there was no danger of slipping. Moreover, because the mountain roads in Yánglóusī were winding and difficult to navigate, many elderly mountain dwellers volunteered to act as guides. After reaching the designated location, the attack began. These elderly men remained steadfast and fearless. Furthermore, the assistance provided by the people along the way to the troops in terms of drinking water, food, transportation, and stretchers was deeply appreciated by the officers and soldiers. The courage of the attacking soldiers was thereby doubled, leading to this victory. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Mìluó: Recently, the Japanese side has transported over a thousand infantrymen, an artillery regiment, and a thousand horses to Yánglóusī from the Yuèyáng area. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Local News) Former Kuomintang Vice President Wāng Jīngwèi, since being expelled from the party, has been residing in Hanoi and has repeatedly published pro-peace absurdities, stirring trouble. This has long been despised by the people of the country. Yesterday, according to foreign sources, four young people went to his residence on the morning of the 20th to carry out an assassination. At that time, Wāng and his wife Chén Bìjūn, as well as Zēng Zhòngmíng and Fāng Jūnbì, were together. Except for Wāng, who escaped unscathed, Chén, Zēng, and Fāng were all shot and wounded.

<p>(Hong Kong) Mr. [blank] of the University of Hong Kong recently gave a speech at an educational gathering, praising Chairman Jiǎng extensively.

He said, "Mr. Jiǎng, with his noble personality, unwavering will, and steadfast belief in great principles, has united the people of the whole country. Therefore, he is the hero produced in this war. The other hero is the poor Chinese peasant. They come from the fields, equipped with simple clothing and weapons, and defend the trenches to the death. Countless numbers have endured hardship and died. Therefore, we should pay the highest respect to General Jiǎng and the general soldiers." (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Foreigners' Residences in Xiāngyáng Bombed</h3>

<h3>Qióngyá Guerrilla Force Active; Once Recaptured Wénchāng City; Hundreds of Japanese Soldiers Killed, Retreat to Tánniú Market; Chinese Army's Counterattack on Dìng'ān Three Gains and Three Losses</h3>
<p>Guìlín: A person from Qióngyá reported that since the Japanese army landed in Qióngyá, they have committed rape, arson, and murder, a terrible tragedy. Compatriots, unable to endure the trampling, have risked sailing to Guǎngzhōu Bay, reaching over 2,000 people. Recently, the guerrilla force in Qióngyá has been very active. In the latter half of last month, over a hundred people, disguised as villagers, infiltrated Wénchāng City, killing hundreds of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army retreated to Tánniú Market, 15 li from the city. Wénchāng was thus recaptured once. Later, in order to retaliate, the Japanese army carried out indiscriminate bombing of all the villages and towns in Wénchāng County, causing even greater casualties to the people. Currently, the Chinese army's counterattack on Dìng'ān County has resulted in three gains and three losses, becoming a tug-of-war, and is currently fighting to the death with the Japanese army. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Czechs Express Opposition to Germany</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) After Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, the Czech community in Hong Kong has reportedly received instructions to switch to German passports.

After a long and fierce battle, the Chinese aircraft, using their outnumbered strength and agile shooting, shot down two Japanese planes into the sea. The remaining Japanese planes scattered in all directions. The Chinese aircraft, seeing that their objective had been achieved, did not pursue them further and returned to their base. (Express News Agency, 21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) A dispatch from Guǎngzhōu Bay reports that the Japanese soldiers in the Hǎikǒu area of Wéizhōu Island have been returning to their ships in recent days, raising fires and preparing to depart, seemingly urgently.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>World Peace Hinges on Germany</h3>
<p>The German leader, Hitler, having subjugated Czechoslovakia, triumphantly returned to Berlin yesterday. Party members and people welcomed him throughout the country. General Göring, representing the country, made a dedicatory speech, saying, "The leader has not only restored the historical glory of the German nation, but also placed Germany on the security of a rock." Göring is the dictator of Germany's four-year economic plan, the speaker of the Reichstag, the Minister of Aviation, and the Governor of Prussia. He is Hitler's only right-hand man and the heir apparent to Hitler in the eyes of the world. For this man to make such a eulogy on this occasion, he must have carefully considered his words, making them perfectly appropriate and not merely idle flattery. However, how can this be so diametrically opposed to the world's perception of Germany and Hitler, and the world's fear for the future of the overall situation? Can this really be explained by "Being a minister of the Hàn dynasty, how can I not say so?" If that is the explanation, then he is merely a flattering sycophant and not worthy to be called a national hero.</p>
<p>Germany's swallowing of Czechoslovakia has been universally condemned as barbaric, violent, sinful, and a breach of faith. Britain, America, France, and Russia do not recognize its legitimacy, in order to highlight its illegality. Britain and France have even recalled their ambassadors to show their disdain. This is an unprecedented shame for the German nation. What glory is there to speak of?</p>
<p>The world's four democratic powers have launched sanctions and are competing to prepare for war. Combining the military and economic power of Britain, America, Russia, and France, who can compete with them? Moreover, the six southeastern countries of Poland, Greece, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia share common interests and have advocated for a united front. With their collective strength and the support of many, they can certainly cope on the battlefield. This should be a cause for sleepless nights for those in Germany who are concerned about their country. Furthermore, U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles, following the President's lead, condemned Germany's actions, saying that Czechoslovakia's misfortune was only temporary. Saying temporary means that there is a way to reverse the situation and implies the prospect of restoring the country. Also, British Prime Minister Chamberlain, known for appeasing Germany and being an unparalleled peacemaker, frankly admitted to being deceived and was overcome with anger. During his speech in Birmingham, he asserted that Germany's unjust actions would inevitably bring retribution upon itself. He also asserted that the German people would one day turn their anger towards the current authorities for the evil they have sown. Is this just an old man cursing like a village woman? He must have profound insight and knowledge, and he must be speaking with substance, with a well-thought-out plan to follow. All of this shows that Germany has made many enemies and built up deep resentment. Once it starts trouble, it will be besieged. It is as dangerous as a pile of eggs. What security on a rock is there to speak of?</p>
<p>Do the German government and people understand this? Today, the world is turbulent and public opinion is seething. Those who hate Germany are gloating, happy that Germany has been abandoned by all and is facing its doom. Those who love Germany are deeply saddened and alarmed that Germany has angered everyone and is facing a calamity. We truly do not know how Hitler is calculating, nor do we know what Göring feels that he still considers himself honored, nor what he relies on that he still boasts of security. We do not believe that Germany alone is intelligent and the rest of the world is foolish, that the difference in intelligence is so great that the world cannot fathom Germany's depth. Then, how will Germany manage this turbulent situation? To say that they have nothing to fear is self-deception. The Germans do indeed have a fearless spirit, but how can spirit alone repel enemies and avert disaster? We deeply admire the German nation. They are intelligent and strong, truly one of the world's outstanding nations. Throughout history, they have made many contributions to the humanities and sciences. We also know that Germany has a glorious history. The power of Wilhelm I is still vivid in our minds. However, since the defeat in the Great War, its national strength has been exhausted. After enduring countless hardships and difficult construction, it has achieved the recent revival. Yet, it has disregarded the lessons of history, disregarded the trust of humanity, and disregarded the survival of other races, and has once again become the target of public criticism. The tragedy of twenty years ago is about to be re-enacted today. The efforts of the past twenty years are about to be destroyed in a single day. Is this not lamentable and regrettable?</p>
<p>On the day the Great War breaks out, no matter how many battles Germany wins, how invincible it is, there is absolutely no hope of achieving final victory. The strategy of defeating them one by one has already failed, and the anger of the masses is insurmountable. Germany will not be spared. Moreover, as the general trend shows, no country or individual is happy about the outbreak of a world war. However, countries have repeatedly said that their tolerance for Germany has its limits. Now, with Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, they have unanimously said that it has broken the limits and they can no longer tolerate it. The fear of Germany's insatiability and the desire to restrain Germany for their own security are widespread and deeply rooted. The peace hoax of Munich will no longer be allowed to be re-enacted in order to seek so-called temporary peace. The old peacemaker is angry, and the international anti-German front is almost encircling Germany several times over. Today, it is difficult to find a glimmer of hope for peace. If there is one, it is that the German government and people can look ahead and behind, assess the situation, and with great wisdom and courage, take the initiative to resolve the problem. If they know that they are causing trouble, why not repent? Repenting for the trouble when the catastrophe is about to break out is the last chance to repent. Today, if Germany can suddenly change its course, and, in addition to words that can no longer be trusted by the world, base its actions on heroic character, display the spirit of sportsmanship, restrain its aggressiveness, strive for humility, and correct the facts with bright actions, transforming its policies frankly, and restricting its expansion, sharing it with the world to see and hear, then it will surely be trusted, understood, and comforted by the world. Even today, Germany still has this opportunity. Moreover, maintaining glory and seeking security depend solely on this opportunity. Opportunities do not come often and are fleeting. It is up to the German government and people to consider it.</p>

(3) The Shandong Provincial Government telegraphed that Yu Ren-zhi, acting commander of the First District Security Forces of the province, had died heroically resisting the enemy, requesting preferential treatment and commendation. Resolution: Request the National Government to issue a clear commendation, record his life achievements in the History Museum for propaganda, and provide generous compensation. The education of his children will be handled by the Ministry of Education with tuition waivers. The following is an excerpt from the original telegram from the Shandong Provincial Government: [Titles omitted] "According to a telegram from the First District Security Command, Acting Security Commander Yu Ren-zhi led his troops to attack the enemy under orders, engaging the enemy and puppets in fierce battle all day long. Unexpectedly, the enemy greatly reinforced their forces. Commander Yu, with exhausted troops, suddenly faced a formidable enemy, attacked from both sides, and was heavily surrounded. He was seriously wounded but continued to fight bravely, annihilating dozens of enemy soldiers before breaking through the encirclement, ultimately succumbing to his injuries. Only half of the troops he led survived, the rest making heroic sacrifices. Troops have been urgently dispatched to engage the enemy. Acting Commander Yu Ren-zhi was exceptionally loyal and courageous, venturing deep behind enemy lines to carry out his duties. The environment was harsh, facing enemies on all sides, and he engaged in melee combat with the enemy on numerous occasions. Now he has given his life for his country. Reflecting on his great achievements keeps us awake at night, and contemplating his loyalty tears our hearts apart. In addition to supervising subordinates to handle the aftermath, we respectfully request preferential treatment and commendation to comfort his loyal soul."

<h3>Fate of Chairman of the Tianjin British Chamber of Commerce Still Unknown</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, Mr. T.O.T. O'Neill, 52 years old, was kidnapped by three Chinese individuals from his residence at No. 1 Niuzhuang Road in the former German concession on the 17th of this month. Four days have passed, and there is still no trace of him. The British authorities here are making every effort to find Mr. O'Neill's whereabouts and rescue him. The investigation relies heavily on the assistance of the Japanese authorities. Today, the authorities have agreed to cooperate fully. The kidnapped victim is the manager of Wilson &amp; Co. and one of the most prominent British residents. Outside concerns for Mr. O'Neill's safety are deepening. According to detailed information obtained from a reliable eyewitness, Mr. O'Neill might have been released within minutes of being kidnapped if not for a Chinese policeman and several Chinese bystanders doing nothing. After the kidnappers forced Mr. O'Neill out of the back door of his residence and into a car waiting there, the car engine broke down less than 200 yards away. Curious onlookers gathered around the car. Although Mr. O'Neill had blood on his forehead, indicating his distress, no one came forward to help. A policeman on duty less than 20 yards away also turned a blind eye and did not leave his post. Mr. O'Neill sat in the car with his hands tied behind his back. After half an hour, the kidnappers hijacked a rental car from a car shop not far from the broken-down car on Dagu Road, forced Mr. O'Neill into the car, and immediately sped off towards Dagu. Subsequent investigation revealed that the license plate on the broken-down car was counterfeit. When the kidnappers appeared at Mr. O'Neill's residence, he was on the phone. The kidnappers' actions were no different from those of gangsters in American movies, first cutting the phone line. Mr. O'Neill's wife ran down from upstairs to try to stop her husband from being kidnapped but was struck by the kidnappers and pushed aside. The kidnappers threatened the Chinese cook and servants with weapons before entering the house. After the kidnappers fled, the cook followed them. Although he saw Mr. O'Neill sitting in the broken-down car, he was frightened and didn't know what to do. The general consensus among foreigners here is that the kidnappers are pro-Japanese terrorists. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Comforting the Troops Association: Work Divided</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) After the National Committee for Comforting the Troops Fighting the War of Resistance held a Spring Festival comfort meeting in Chongqing, it dispatched trucks carrying a large quantity of Sichuan-produced pickled mustard and other items to Guangxi due to the large number of wounded soldiers there. Together with the Guangxi Friends of Wounded Soldiers Association, they prepared over 15,000 comfort bags and expanded their comfort efforts within Guangxi Province in the early part of this month. Recently, they delivered over 10,000 catties of pickled turnip and mustard sprouts to the front lines in central Hubei via representatives of the 26th Army and 32nd Division, and they will dispatch tens of thousands more catties to the Xiangfan front lines. Moreover, a sudden influx of over 10,000 new recruits are currently undergoing concentrated training and will be dispatched to the front lines soon. The Association has dispatched personnel to investigate and plans to send a delegation to organize a comfort team, bringing a large number of comfort items to comfort them. The Association, recognizing the tense situation on the northern front lines and in Xiangfan, has decided to send separate delegations to comfort them. (Telegraphed on the 21st)</p>
<p>Guilin: The Women's Guidance Committee of the New Transportation Association specially transported 154 boxes of milk, 19 packages of gauze, and 29 packages of cotton to Guilin to comfort the wounded soldiers from Guangdong, requesting Mrs. Li and Mrs. Bai to receive and forward them.

<h3>Military-Civilian Cooperation on the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Front Lines</h3>
<p>(Changsha) This reporter met a guerrilla commander in the border area of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi in a certain location. According to him, the anti-Japanese sentiment among the people at the front is high, and the military and civilians are able to cooperate well. The belief in final victory is deeply rooted in people's hearts, and they have been able to genuinely and voluntarily assist the army in tasks such as protecting stretcher bearers. Counting only the combat results of his unit in March, they have killed over a thousand Japanese soldiers, destroyed two Japanese warehouses, seized over 800 rifles and two light machine guns, and captured eight Japanese soldiers.

<h3>Excavation of Zhang Xianzhong's Sunken Silver in Chengdu; Authorized by the Ministry of Finance, but Still No Results</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Currently, the Jianghe Qingjun Company is excavating 100 million taels of silver sunken by Zhang Xianzhong at the bottom of the Dong River outside Chengdu. The reason for the firm belief that Zhang Xianzhong indeed sank 100 million taels of silver at the bottom of the Dong River is based on three points: (1) Zhang collected a large amount of wealth from the wealthy people of Sichuan; (2) when Zhang passed through Shanxi on his way to attack Beiping, he engaged in large-scale looting; (3) after Zhang was defeated in Beiping, he returned to Sichuan through Shanxi. It is believed that he transported all the spoils of war back to Chengdu and buried them at the bottom of the Dong River outside Chengdu. The excavation of Zhang Xianzhong's sunken silver by the Jianghe Qingjun Company is authorized by the Ministry of Finance. As of now, there have been no results. All the excavation workers are prisoners and are not allowed to go outside, being guarded by military police. At the same time, foreigners are not allowed to enter. The company promises that if anything is found, they will donate 80% to the state, and the other 20% will be used for relief. (Associated Press dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Warfare Occurring Frequently in Rehe</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to travelers who have just arrived here from Zhangjiakou, the Japanese army has been moving troops frequently between Chahar and Rehe in the past week. Japanese troops moving westward from Chahar Province are incessant. Whether these Japanese troops are being transferred to Suiyuan to prepare for an invasion of the Northwest or to defend against a southward advance by the Mongolian army is currently unknown. What is known is that in the past two weeks, "mutiny" incidents have occurred from time to time among the "Manchukuo" army and the "Inner Mongolian" army stationed in the Suiyuan area. These Japanese troops may have been transferred to Suiyuan Province to prevent the puppet army from "mutinying" again, which is also unknown. The traveler continued, stating that the power of the Chinese guerrillas in Inner Mongolia is growing daily, and their area of activity has gradually expanded eastward. This can be seen in the frequent occurrence of guerrilla warfare in Rehe Province in recent days. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Construction Department Plans to Develop Mineral Resources</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Before the war, most of Jiangxi Province's trade was exported via the Nanxun Railway. After northern Jiangxi became a guerrilla zone, the wartime trade department of the province was established, with transportation via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway highway being relatively convenient. According to estimates by the Construction Department, the total export value for the 27th year of the Republic was approximately 120 million yuan, with rice, tea, tungsten ore, and paper accounting for the majority, representing over 70% of the total value. Looking at the tea and rice items from last year alone, rice exports and sales to Zhejiang, Guangdong, Fujian, and other provinces reached approximately 1.1 million bags (200 catties per bag), with a total value of 10 million yuan. Exports of Anhui-Jiangxi green tea leaves had a total value of over 3 million yuan, accounting for half. The Construction Department is now actively planning to develop mineral resources and actively export them, and it has established a tin ore smelting plant to extract pure tin for sale outside the province in order to enrich Jiangxi's economic power.

<h3>UK House of Commons Passes Second Reading of Bill to Help China Stabilize Currency; Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon Attends and Explains That This Move Benefits Both China and the UK</h3>
<p>(London) The China Bill (stabilizing legal tender) passed its second reading in the House of Commons today, and the attached financial resolution was also approved. The bill provides for the establishment of a fund of £10 million to curb fluctuations in the exchange rate of legal tender against the pound. No objections to the bill were voiced in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>When Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon moved the second reading of the bill, he declared that although the total volume of British trade with China did not account for a high percentage of Britain's total trade with the world, it was worth maintaining and assisting, especially because of China's large population, where even a slight increase in per capita purchases would make a big difference. Since the outbreak of the current war, China's currency system, which was launched in 1935, has been severely tested. China has adopted technically sophisticated methods with careful planning, and overseas Chinese have also provided assistance to legal tender through remittances, donations, and loans. Last year, the legal tender remained stable throughout, with very little disturbance or erosion of confidence. If the House of Commons approves this bill, it can be guaranteed that China will be able to maintain its credibility and tradition in this matter.</p>
<p>Labour MP Lawrence immediately stated that he would support this bill because what is stipulated in it is sufficient to promote British trade, especially because this move can provide practical assistance to China's struggle against Japan. The time may have come when the government should consider taking other actions to strengthen the Chinese people's resistance and curb the extent to which the Japanese attempt to control people's lives. Independent Labour MP Mander also supported the bill, stating that the spirit in which the government is pursuing this matter is too narrow. He deeply regretted that the government should expand its actions to ensure that British trade has free access to this part of the world. The government is now only implementing the resolutions of the League of Nations. Conservative MP Boothby stated that he regretted that this assistance was not realized earlier and that it was insufficient.</p>
<p>Labour MP Smith moved to reject the bill, saying that it would be difficult to curb the fluctuations in legal tender unless the government pursued another political and economic policy in the Far East. The government is derelict in its duty for not taking the lead in providing humanitarian assistance to the Chinese people in order to avoid offending Japan. In the past eight years, the government's policies have always been about colluding with aggressors at the expense of victims. Labour MP Tinker supported the amendment, saying that what the government is doing now is the result of our failure to take a firm stand when Japan invaded China.</p>
<p>National Conservative MP Astor stated that he hoped that no insistence would be made on the amendment. Nothing could inspire the Chinese government and people more than the unanimous passage of this bill by the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Labour MP Burke said that any concessions to maintain the cotton industry, however small, and to help workers maintain the markets they have gained, would be greatly appreciated by the workers. He believed that Japan's struggle would truly begin after the war ended. If the amendment were pushed and the House of Commons had to divide on it, he would vote in favor of the government's proposal. Labour MP Bellenger stated that if the purpose of this bill was to encourage trade between China and the UK, he would support it. At this point, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon interjected, saying that this was indeed the purpose of the bill. Then Bellenger asked whether this fund would be used in cooperation with the United States and France, as in the state of a trilateral currency agreement. The Chancellor replied that other governments had already provided financial assistance to China in different ways, such as the US government currently purchasing large quantities of silver from China. However, with regard to this proposal, he must ask the House of Commons to accept it as our contribution to China.</p>
<p>Treasury Financial Secretary Wallace replied to the debate, saying that the opposition spokesman had acknowledged that £10 million was sufficient for this purpose, and it was also acknowledged in the debate that China's legal tender was not shaken at the moment and that it had been stable for many years, receiving excellent internal assistance. Wallace denied the claim that this proposal was issued to support private banks, saying that the reason for uniting with four banks to manage this fund was that the government could utilize a large amount of ability and experience in this matter, and the four banks also considered it a great honor to participate in this action. Regardless of whether the government could have assisted China in the past, there is no doubt that this bill is a clear and significant assistance to China. He hoped that the House of Commons would pass this bill unanimously, as this action would have a great psychological effect on China. Wallace then mentioned Japan's currency plan in North China and the British government's protest against this plan, saying that what was even more gratifying was that the most qualified commentators all believed that Japan's plan was bound to fail in reality. If the price of legal tender were to be changed from one shilling and six and a half pence to one shilling and two pence, the immediate result would seem to be a halt to export trade. China's legal tender would continue to circulate as usual, except in some towns and railway areas controlled by the Japanese army. As for the place where the fund will be used, it will be in Hong Kong. The £10 million will soon be raised, and the interest income from the fund will be used to subsidize the interest payable by Chinese banks to British banks. The interest rate is currently agreed at 2.75%. If the agreement is continued after one year, the interest rate may increase or decrease depending on the situation at the time. As for the reason why the upward interest rate is not detailed in the proposal, it is because the agreement may continue for several years, and because we do not want to return to the House of Commons from time to time to request approval.

<h3>Japanese Poisoning Weihaiwei with Opium; British MP Questions Government</h3>
<p>(London) Conservative MP Haslam asked in the House of Commons today whether the Prime Minister knew that when Britain leased Weihaiwei, there was no opium poisoning in the port and surrounding areas, and that this was also the case afterward, until after the Japanese army occupied it, many opium dens had been opened. Whether the Prime Minister would call the Japanese government's attention to the serious consequences of allowing opium dens to exist and even increase in the Chinese territories occupied by the Japanese army. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied that, yes, this issue is currently under consideration. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<h3>Joint Declaration Drafted by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union: Collective Deterrence of German Aggression; Soviet Union Advocates Security System Not Limited to Eastern Europe; Britain Principally Agrees to Convene Six-Nation Conference; French Foreign Minister Bonnet Begins Exchanging Views with Britain</h3>
<p>(London) A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated today that London and other European capitals are currently engaged in rapid negotiations to draft a joint declaration by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. This declaration will explicitly state that should further acts of aggression occur, the collective powers will certainly resist them. This matter has now been initiated by Britain and France, feeling that this is a preliminary measure to prevent any sudden new acts of aggression in the most rapid and effective manner. Since the Soviet Union suggested that relevant democratic countries should immediately hold a conference to decide their attitude towards the new situation created by Germany, Britain felt that the situation was extremely urgent and that issuing the aforementioned declaration would be better than convening a conference, as negotiations to draft a declaration would take less time than holding a conference. The Soviet Union seems to have no objection to the British proposal, but the Soviet Union wants to be sure that Britain and France are truly prepared to act in the event of an emergency. It is estimated that the Soviet Union will make the convening of a conference after the declaration is issued, according to the Soviet Union's proposed method, a condition for joining the declaration. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the British government's plan for a collective security system organization in Eastern Europe, after exchanging views with the governments of the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Bulgaria, well-informed sources here recently stated that Foreign Secretary Halifax will hold important talks with French Foreign Minister Bonnet today, and Foreign Minister Bonnet will inform him of the French government's views. As for the content of the British plan, the outside world is still unaware. It is reported that it will include a restraint, stating that if Romania and other small countries join and are then subjected to aggression by other countries, other signatory countries will provide assistance. However, whether military assistance is included depends on the attitudes of the Soviet Union and Poland, which are still unclear. It must be determined after British and French authorities hold talks and begin consultations with the Soviet Union and Poland. As of now, only Turkey has stated that it is willing to accept the British plan and is prepared to send troops to assist Romania in dealing with all contingencies. In addition, the British government is also in close contact with the United States and has also inquired about the opinions of South American countries. The reports submitted by British envoys to various South American countries regarding this matter arrived at the Foreign Office last night. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) A diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Telegraph claims that people in London are now afraid that the situation will suddenly become tense and catch them off guard, causing the major power conference suggested by Moscow to fail to be held in time. Currently, Britain and France believe that a clear declaration signed by relevant major powers and joined by other countries is the most practical first step in creating a new security system in Europe based on mutual interests. The Soviet Union is prepared to join this effort, but must be certain that Western European powers truly intend to take action. The Soviet Union does not necessarily want to limit the significance of this declaration to Eastern Europe. Yesterday, diplomatic circles believed that Germany's eastward advance had somewhat stalled, but the direction of Germany's future steps may be towards Lithuania. Many believe that Germany will soon annex Memel. Lithuania is not prepared to offer effective resistance, but if Germany's ambitions extend to the mainland of Lithuania, Poland will not stand idly by. According to general speculation, the next major development will be Italy's presentation of demands to France. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Soviet government's proposal to convene an international peace conference, the British government has recently responded that, in principle, the British government completely agrees with the Soviet Union's proposal. A correspondent for the Hai Tong News Agency recently learned from well-informed sources that the Soviet Union proposed convening a six-nation conference, namely Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Romania, Poland, and Turkey. The British government has notified Moscow, informing them that Britain has no special opinion regarding the location of the meeting, but believes that holding it in the capital of Romania is most appropriate. British political figures have paid close attention to the fact that Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Greece have not been invited to participate. (Hai Tong, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) The reports submitted by the ambassadors of various countries stationed in Britain to their respective governments all unanimously recognize that the situation is very dangerous, but express that a major war will not necessarily break out immediately. They all believe that Britain's attempt to reach an understanding with the Soviet Union is the most important aspect of British policy. Foreign Secretary Halifax is scheduled to meet with the Polish Ambassador to Britain, Raczynski, tomorrow to hear Poland's attitude towards participating in the proposed "alliance to deter aggressors." At the same time, Britain will also inquire about the opinions of Yugoslavia, Turkey, Greece, and Bulgaria on forming a common front to prevent Germany from extending its influence beyond the borders of Czechoslovakia. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet held a meeting this morning. According to responsible sources, Foreign Secretary Halifax presented a report on the international situation. The Cabinet immediately decided in principle to support Romania and establish a collective security system in Eastern Europe to curb Germany's expansion of influence towards the Black Sea coast. It is reported that the British government is fully organizing a group, the nature of which should be similar to the alliance group used to combat Napoleon I's hegemony more than a century ago. It is generally expected that British and French authorities will jointly issue a declaration after French President Lebrun's visit to Britain (March 21), stating that both sides are determined to prevent new German aggression. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to reports in various newspapers here this morning, the purpose of the recent active and frequent diplomatic activities in Paris and London is to unite Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Soviet Russia to establish a defensive group in Eastern Europe to prevent Germany from advancing eastward. Le Petit Journal reported, "France is directly interested in this effort and is actively building its own cornerstone." (Hai Tong, 21st)</p>
<h3>U.S. Note to Germany Protests Armed Invasion of Czechoslovakia: Considered a Threat to World Security, Unprecedented Sharp Language</h3>
<p>(Washington) The United States government formally protested to Germany last night against Germany's armed invasion of Czechoslovakia. According to official sources, this note is the sharpest note sent by the United States to another country in peacetime. Some quarters indicate that this protest may cause a rupture in relations between Berlin and Washington. It is reported that the note used direct and fierce language to recognize that Germany's invasion of Czechoslovakia violated international law and posed a threat to world security. (Associated Press, 21st)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Did Not Provide Promises of Assistance to Romania and Poland</h3>
<p>(Moscow) TASS is instructed to deny the rumors that the Soviet government recently provided Poland and Romania with promises of assistance in the event that they were subjected to foreign aggression. The two countries did not appeal to the Soviet Union for assistance, nor did they notify the Soviet government of the danger they are currently threatened with. However, the British government notified the Soviet government on March 18 that there were significant reasons to fear that violent action would be taken against Romania, and inquired about what stance the Soviet Union intended to take to deal with this change. In its reply, the Soviet government proposed convening a conference of countries with close ties, namely Britain, France, Poland, Romania, Turkey, and the Soviet Union, but the British government felt that this suggestion was still premature.

<h3>American Economic Weaponry Can Suffocate Germany</h3>
<p>(Washington) People here do not believe that the American authorities can agree to actively participate in the democratic countries' congress. What the American authorities can offer is in the economic and spiritual aspects. As for sending troops overseas to participate in foreign wars, it is not something that the American authorities can agree to. However, the guarantee that American economic weaponry can be used by democratic countries is also sufficient to consolidate the European peace front. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Experts from the Department of Commerce held a meeting today to discuss a report on Germany's economic situation. Secretary of Commerce Hopkins personally presided over the meeting. According to this report, Germany's financial burden has increased significantly after annexing Austria and the Sudetenland. The occupation of Czechoslovakia may not bring significant commercial benefits. The country's cash reserves, including those of Czechoslovakia, amount to approximately $250 million to $300 million. As such, if the country adopts a blitzkrieg policy, it will be in an "advantageous position" due to its preemptive strike. Even in long-term warfare, it can barely support itself financially, but the people's living standards will definitely decline. As far as the country's economy is concerned, it does not have the strength to resist for a long time. ) Havas, 20th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The Italian Ambassador to Germany hurriedly returned to Rome today to report on the situation to Mussolini. His departure from Berlin was quite secretive. German newspapers have not yet published news of his return. It is reported that the Italian Ambassador to Germany met with Hitler on Monday evening, at which time Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and General Göring were also present. According to well-informed sources, the Italian Ambassador carried a letter from Hitler to Mussolini on this return trip and should return to Berlin no later than Friday morning. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<h3>French President Lebrun and Foreign Minister Arrive in London; Warmly Welcomed by Government and Public</h3>
<p>(London) French President Lebrun and his wife arrived in London today for a formal return visit and will remain until Friday before returning to their country. The closeness of the relationship between Britain and France can be seen in the warm welcome from the British government and public. London residents were packed on the streets that the French President and others would pass through, hoping to catch a glimpse of his appearance. Each street was decorated with French flags and coats of arms. The ship carrying the French President, under the protection of British warships and Royal Air Force bombers, passed through a line of warships adorned with flags and sailed into Dover Harbor. Each warship fired a 21-gun salute to express its welcome. The Duke of Gloucester, brother of the King of England, personally waited there to greet them. He and the French President and others transferred to a train to London, arriving at Victoria Station at 3:00 PM. The King and Queen of England, other members of the royal family, the British Prime Minister, and cabinet members were all at the station to welcome them. The King and Queen and the French President and his wife then drove to Buckingham Palace. A formal welcoming banquet will be held at the palace in the evening. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary's Speech Condemns German Crimes: Who Can Believe that the Czech Republic's Submission Under Violent Oppression Represents the Will of the People? Foreign Secretary Expresses Sympathy for the Czech People</h3>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Halifax today condemned Germany's actions in Czechoslovakia in clear terms in the House of Lords, stating that the various events that occurred in Czechoslovakia before the German military invasion were clearly intentionally created by the German side, and the impact of these events was also clearly intentionally exaggerated by the German side. Although the German side said that Germany was harmed by Czechoslovakia, no one lightly believes it. It seems that differences of opinion between British parties no longer exist when serious issues are at stake. Recent European events have indeed shocked thoughtful people at home and abroad. When the Czech President and Foreign Minister were on their way to meet with Hitler on March 3 and had not yet held discussions, German troops had already occupied two Czech towns. How could this be a meaningless action? The Foreign Secretary mentioned Hitler's announcement that Czech territory was under German protection, saying that there were points to note in the announcement. Although the leader of the new Czech administrative organs was called the head of the Czech Protectorate, and this Protectorate was called self-governing, in administration, Germany stationed an official in Prague who had the right to veto resolutions. In military affairs, Germany stationed troops in Czech territory. In diplomatic affairs, Germany was responsible for Czech diplomatic matters and protecting its people abroad. In customs, the Czech Republic joined the German customs union. In addition, the German government could issue orders and take any measures to maintain peace and order. As a result of these actions, Czechoslovakia can now be said to be completely dismembered. He absolutely did not believe that some leaders in Slovakia could have suddenly made the decision to break away from relations with Czechoslovakia without prior external assistance. The German claim that the Czech President voluntarily surrendered the country is even more unnecessary to refute. Looking at the circumstances when the Czech President went to Berlin and German troops occupied the Czech border, anyone with a little knowledge knows that there was no so-called negotiation at the time. It was just a matter of placing an ultimatum before the Czech leaders under the threat of force. The reason why the Czech leaders succumbed was to protect the people from the tragedy of being rapidly destroyed by aerial bombardment. In this environment, the British government believed that it was appropriate to take some action immediately. Therefore, it canceled the commercial negotiations with Germany and decided to recall the Ambassador to Germany to make the German government aware of the British government's attitude. The Germans cited the past history of the British Empire to defend Germany's actions. However, it should be known that the principle followed by the British Empire is self-government. Wherever the British went, they left a legacy of freedom and self-government, unlike those who destroy freedom. Britain certainly recognizes that Germany has a greater interest in southeastern Europe than Britain, but after forcibly destroying a sovereign country and violating the simplest rules of international conduct, its position has completely changed. The British opposition party accused Chamberlain's Munich policy of being a personal policy. If this means that it was a policy that Chamberlain used all his energy, imagination, and determination for, he should not deny it. But if it means that Chamberlain pursued this policy without the full cooperation of the Foreign Secretary and other cabinet members, then he cannot but emphatically deny it. The purpose of the Munich settlement was twofold. First, in the then extremely difficult environment, to seek a possible fair solution to the real problems that had to be dealt with, in order to preserve European peace. Judging from the information obtained on that day, the government's adoption of this path was certainly correct. Second, to promote greater security for the people of Europe on the basis of mutually agreed consultations, as a way to adjust various disputes in the future. Unexpectedly, this purpose was erased by recent events. On that day, Hitler had used the principle of self-determination as a request, but soon after, Germany had destroyed this principle with its various actions and denied the right to self-determination on which its attitude was based. Regardless of whether the ill-treatment suffered by the 250,000 Germans is true or not, no one can believe that this ill-treatment can only be compensated for by the subjugation of 8 million Czechs. Is German policy about to enter a new stage of attempting to rule non-Germanic peoples? The world is now asking this question. Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia, the means it used were different from before. The world has now seen a new trick in international negotiations. Germany encourages separatist trends in other countries, not only for the benefit of the separatists, but also for the benefit of the German Empire. This method is quite simple, and in experience, it has been repeatedly verified. Does the world now have a guarantee that this method will not be applied to other countries? All those who border Germany do not know their fate tomorrow. All countries that cherish their national survival and sovereignty are terrified of the danger of being instigated from the outside to cause internal strife. Now, the Romanian government has denied the claim that Germany presented an ultimatum, but is there anything strange about it? The Romanian government and other governments, in light of the events that have occurred in the past few days, all have great hidden concerns. The Foreign Secretary then spoke in detail about the measures to relieve refugees, saying that the British government should do what it can to alleviate the adverse effects of recent events, but its success will depend on the attitude of the German government. The British people have been willing to promote friendship with the German people for the past several years. The British are not unaware of the mistakes of the Treaty of Versailles, but in the past few years, whenever there has been an opportunity to seek understanding, the German government has always taken actions that prevent this understanding from proceeding, such as the events of recent months, which are even more so. The ink on the Munich Agreement was not yet dry, and Germany had already taken actions that shocked the world. Britain's initiation of British-German economic cooperation has been cancelled by Germany's actions last week. When can Britain's attempt be resumed? It is still difficult to predict now. The British government has been taught by recent events, so it has immediately engaged in close and practical consultations with the autonomous territories and other relevant governments on obvious issues. History is full of records of attempts to dominate Europe, but they have all ended in tragic failure. If history can be a lesson, then the German people will eventually regret their actions against Czechoslovakia. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) When Foreign Secretary Halifax spoke in the House of Lords today, he expressed sympathy for the Czech people, saying that twenty years ago, the Czech people, with the support and encouragement of the majority of the world, regained their freedom, and now this freedom has been exploited by violence. The Czech people are known for their patience, courage, and diligence. In their long history, they have lost their independence more than once, but they have never lost their love for freedom. This is the foundation of independence. Therefore, those who saw the establishment of the Czech state after the Great War will today watch it maintain its entire culture and spiritual freedom under this last and most cruel blow.

<h3>Germany Covets Memel; Lithuanian Foreign Minister Returns from Germany, Says Peaceful Resolution Can Be Expected</h3>
<p>Memel, the capital of Lithuania: The attitude of the National Socialist Party in Memel is firm, leading to a serious situation. The Lithuanian Parliament convened an emergency meeting this morning, at which time the government will issue its opinion. Since Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys met with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Berlin yesterday, political figures in Lithuania have believed that Germany will assist the German Independent Party in Memel. Lithuanian President Smetona and Prime Minister Mironas have both called on Lithuanian youth to strengthen resistance. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Political figures here are gradually believing that the return of Memel to Germany has been resolved in yesterday's meeting between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys. The Lithuanian Foreign Minister's visit is said to be a ceremonial visit, but he only left after 45 minutes. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Lithuanian Foreign Minister Ubšys will leave here today to return to his country. He refused to disclose the content of his discussion with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop regarding the issue of national self-determination in Memel. According to well-informed sources, the Memel issue can be "peacefully resolved" in general this week. According to reports from East Prussia, Germany has not made any unusual troop movements on the Lithuanian border. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Memel: It is widely rumored here that the Germans in Memel are now planning to make major demands on Lithuania. Although both sides now deny that any conditions have been put forward, it is expected that the Germans will make the following demands: (1) Lithuania should hand over the management rights of transportation facilities such as the Memel post office, telegraph, and railway, as well as the income from Memel port taxes. (2) German officials in Memel who have previously been dismissed should be reinstated and paid back wages. (3) The Lithuanian garrison and border police stationed in the country should be withdrawn.

<h3>Britain and Poland Seek Political and Economic Cooperation; Talks Underway in Warsaw</h3>
<p>Warsaw: British Overseas Trade Secretary Hudson, after arriving here yesterday, immediately held talks with Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, Commerce Minister Roman, Finance Minister Kierzkowski, and Deputy Minister of Commerce Lutosławski. Polish officials recently stated that the main issues discussed by both sides were two: (1) Providing Poland with credit loans so that it can purchase industrial machinery from Britain for use in industrial zones. (2) Providing Poland with credit loans so that it can purchase cotton and zinc and copper minerals from India. In addition, Hudson is said to have presented the Polish authorities with a concrete plan for close cooperation between Poland and Britain and France. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>German Newspapers Launch Fierce Attacks on Britain</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The rumors of Britain's planned international collective action have recently aroused criticism from German newspapers. The German press said that if one believes that collective threats can deprive Germany of its desire to extend its national power, then one is making a big mistake. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, German newspapers are all engaged in a fierce campaign against democratic countries, especially against Britain, while other news is placed in a secondary position. The lines between the lines in each newspaper are filled with humiliation, injustice, and arguments. In addition to being full of criticism and condemnation, it is also said that democratic countries are currently gathering to form a "terrified alliance" to surround Germany. The amount of space occupied by each newspaper's campaign is rare even in Germany. Almost no space on the front page of each newspaper is devoted to news of Hitler's triumphant return to Berlin.

<h3>Promulgation of Substitute Legal Orders: France Begins Partial Mobilization; Calling Up Reserves, Increasing Officer Ranks, Boosting Arms Production, and Forming Indigenous Troop Units</h3>
<p>(Paris) After French Premier Daladier obtained dictatorial powers, he began a partial mobilization last night. There are sixteen types of orders for this partial mobilization, all of which were first approved by the cabinet and then signed by President Lebrun last night. Thus, France has, in fact, embarked on the path of industrial and military mobilization. Regarding military orders, there are three types, stipulating that the government has the right to mobilize any number of reserve troops in the event of an emergency. Furthermore, according to an army official today, the government will soon mobilize a large number of reserve troops. It is also said that the government's proposed mobilization plan is far more extensive than the one implemented during the Czech crisis last September. Another order is for the recall of reserve officers, with the aim of establishing an officer corps to expand at any time. Another order is to increase the combatants in the Sixth Military Region of the Maginot Line. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) Substitute legal orders of a military nature were passed by the Council of State yesterday and have now been published by the Official Gazette. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) 2,500 army officers are added, bringing the total to 31,600. All generals, military police, officers, and officers in charge of arms manufacturing are not included in this calculation. (2) Formation of Moroccan indigenous troops. (3) Some of the conscripts whose active service is expiring may be ordered to remain in service. In addition, reserve soldiers who have retired for less than two years, and reserve soldiers of all ranks, may also be temporarily called into service by the government. (4) When factory owners receive government orders, they should give priority to manufacturing them, and orders from other private individuals may be suspended in whole or in part. (5) The working hours per week for workers in national defense industries are temporarily increased from 40 hours to 60 hours. When necessary, the government may order further increases. (6) A production bureau is established under the Secretariat of the Ministry of National Defense, with the task of (A) increasing the production of various raw materials related to national defense, and (B) supervising the equipment of national defense industry factories and the allocation of required credit loans. (7) All technical and administrative personnel in arms manufacturing factories who have retired may be recalled to service at any time, without any time limit. After being recalled, these personnel should arrive at their posts within eight days. (8) Regarding military intelligence, the disclosure of any information related to the manufacturing and replenishment of domestic ordnance, air defense, and armaments that has not been announced by the government is strictly prohibited. (9) Regarding air defense matters, the procedures for requisitioning property should be simplified. (10) National defense-related industries may obtain advances of up to 650,000,000 francs in case of special needs. (11) The government may prohibit foreigners from residing in fortress areas and near national defense-related locations. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The British government claimed last night that the French army is maintaining extreme secrecy regarding the mobilization of military experts. However, it is believed that this French mobilization is a preliminary step towards mobilizing 20 to 40 divisions of troops in the future. According to British estimates, 60,000 French military experts will be mobilized in accordance with the decree passed by the Daladier cabinet yesterday, along with reserve officers and all sergeants. It is expected that once the new 20 divisions of troops are armed, they will return to their units to await deployment. The total number mobilized by France in September was approximately 120,000. If the European crisis continues to be tense, the total number mobilized by France will have to exceed this by far. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<h3>French Government Holds Military Conference to Discuss North African Defense</h3>
<p>(Paris) After the Council of State passed various substitute legal orders, Premier Daladier convened an important meeting at the Ministry of War, attended by Tunisian Resident-General Labonne, Moroccan Resident-General General Noguès, Algerian Governor-General Le Beau, and Army Chief of Staff General Gamelin. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is reported that the meeting discussed plans for transporting soldiers and military equipment across the Mediterranean in the event of war in Europe, and methods for protecting Morocco. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Earthquake in Japan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At 12:23 PM yesterday, strong earthquakes occurred on the two major islands of Kyushu and Shikoku in Japan. It is reported that the areas where the earthquake was most severe were Miyazaki, Kumamoto, Oita, and Tokushima. Most of the houses in the aforementioned areas collapsed, and many power lines were broken. In particular, almost all the glass windows of shops in Miyazaki and other places were shattered. However, the situation regarding casualties is currently unknown. (Express News Agency, 21st)</p>

<h3>Japanese Emperor Opposes Military Alliance with Germany and Italy; Unwilling to Stake the Nation's Fate on a Single Venture; Supervising National Affairs Breaks Royal Precedent</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The 38-year-old Japanese Emperor Hirohito is now disregarding the precedents of the Japanese Imperial Family and is quite active in directing state affairs. In recent weeks, the Emperor has reversed the behavior of his predecessors and his refined character, and has adopted a posture of supervising national affairs. The Emperor is now unwilling to follow the advice of his advisors and is taking responsibility for making various decisions on his own, guiding the progress of the country with a firm hand. The development of this situation is extremely important for the following reasons: (1) This move is sufficient to prevent the stubborn military from dragging Japan into international difficulties. (2) This move prevents Japan from joining a military alliance with Germany and Italy. (3) This move allows Japan to continue its original political system, without becoming a European-style dictatorship. (4) This move shows that the tense relations between Japan and the democratic countries may improve. According to people close to the Imperial Family, the fact that Japan has not yet concluded a military alliance with Germany and Italy is actually due to the personal decision of the Emperor. It is reported that Japanese Ambassador to Germany Hiroshi Oshima wanted to consider resigning because the government refused to accept his alliance plan. However, it was later learned that the opponent was the Emperor himself, so he had to obey. According to the Japanese political system, the Emperor is the nation, and the nation is the Emperor. Today's Japanese parliament is merely a vent for public opinion, and its role is not important. In practice, the Emperor is a monarch with absolute power. The usual method is for the Emperor to adopt the opinions of the ministers to rule the country. The power of the government has not yet been grasped by the group with the greatest influence on the Emperor. This power is rotated among various oligarchic politicians. Since the start of the war with China, the military has had the greatest power. However, in recent months, the military has lost its power due to not knowing how to properly handle the China Incident, and internal infighting has also occurred. The Emperor is diligent and has an international perspective. From the beginning, he has taken his duties seriously. Before taking the throne, he traveled the world, which was an unprecedented event among Japanese crown princes. Previously, after the rebellion of young officers in February 1936, when the situation deteriorated, he personally came forward to resolve the dispute. He clearly believes that strict and unified leadership is extremely important during this period, so he has grasped even greater power than his grandfather, Emperor Meiji. The Emperor's daring to take such tradition-breaking actions has encountered many difficulties. He cannot directly obtain information and must rely on the reports of various ministers. Although he can summon anyone at any time, he may not be able to fully understand the opinions of all parties. For example, recently, when Army Minister Itagaki met with the Emperor, he originally said that Wu Peifu had agreed to serve as the chairman of the North China Pacification Government. At the time, Itagaki confirmed this as true news, but the subsequent development of the situation proved that Wu did not make this promise. It is reported that Grand Chamberlain Yuasa Kurahei currently holds considerable power. Although he has not received a formal appointment, he has in fact become a senior statesman. The only senior statesman in Japan, Saionji, is too old to fully participate in national affairs. It is reported that Kurahei advocates improving relations with Britain and the United States and opposes concluding a military agreement with Germany and Italy. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<h3>British Government Replies to Japanese Protest Regarding the Treatment of Japanese Residents in Singapore</h3>
<p>(London) The Japanese government protested to the British government regarding the alleged mistreatment of Japanese residents in Singapore on January 25. According to the British government's reply, the search of Japanese residents' homes at that time was carried out in accordance with the law. The police have testified that the Japanese residents intended to carry out actions that would damage Singapore and lead to a disruption of peace. Japanese residents in Singapore have not been subjected to any restrictions other than those imposed on residents of other countries. The dispatch asked the Japanese government to compare the defense plans implemented by Singapore's base with the plans implemented by Japan in its own fortified areas, and it will be known that Singapore's plans are more lenient than Japan's. The article also cites several cases of Japanese police monitoring foreigners and rampant espionage as examples. It concluded by saying that the British government hopes that Japanese residents will pay attention to their obligations of residing in British territory, so as to avoid the need for the British authorities to take any further measures.

<h3>Hungarian-Romanian Relations Tense, Both Sides on Alert at the Border; German Troops Enter Slovak Territory, Motives Unknown, Rumors Abound in the Romanian Capital, People are Panicked</h3>
<p>(Budapest) Relations between Hungary and Romania are not very friendly. Both sides are on alert on the border. However, future developments will largely depend on the overall international situation. It is widely believed that Germany may encourage Hungary in its aim in Outer Transylvania, but everything is currently quiet on the eastern border. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The issue of the Slovak State remains extremely chaotic. According to news from the State, German troops have entered the country and occupied various places, but the German side has denied this in order to appease Poland. In addition, after Hungary occupied Carpathian Ruthenia, it bordered Poland, but due to the winding mountains along the border, transportation is inconvenient, and trade between the two countries is unlikely to develop, let alone military cooperation. It would be more convenient to go through the Slovak State. Although Germany has recognized the border between Poland and Hungary, it is unwilling to allow the Slovak State to become a sphere of influence for these countries. As for the relationship between the Slovak State and Germany, diplomatic circles here are unwilling to disclose anything, but well-informed sources say that the State will establish an alliance relationship with Germany in terms of military affairs and tariffs, and will become an omnipotent state. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(Bucharest) When Romanian King Carol, the Prime Minister, and the General Staff were meeting in the palace today, rumors spread rapidly in the city, and the people were extremely panicked. They hoarded food and other necessities, and those with deposits in banks rushed to withdraw their deposits, fearing any international conflict. A report regarding Hungary massing troops near the Romanian border has not yet been confirmed. According to rumors, German troops crossed Slovakia in four routes and advanced rapidly towards Ruthenia. The reserves of the Second Romanian Army stationed in the Romanian capital may be called into service at any time. It is also reported that the Hungarian radio station broadcasted to the Hungarian minority in Romania that they (referring to the Hungarian minority in Romania) would soon be liberated. It is reported that the Hungarian minority held demonstrations at various points on the Romanian border, but these demonstrations were dispersed by the police. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<h3>Hungary Prepares for War; Mobilization Can Be Completed by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>(Budapest) According to reliable sources, the Hungarian military authorities are implementing mobilization in a systematic manner. It is expected that it will be fully completed by around the 28th of this month. At that time, all young men in the country who have not yet served in the military will be called into service, and vacancies in the regular army will be filled one after another. The newly recruited soldiers should be immediately sent to the border and the Carpathian Ruthenia defense zone to serve. So far, the number of Hungarian troops has doubled. The garrisons in the southeastern regions, especially the garrisons in Debrecen (near Romania) and Szeged (near Romania and Yugoslavia), have been strengthened. However, the garrisons in various places are not in wartime formations, presumably to prevent foreign countries from saying that Hungary intends to invade. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Bucharest) After the Hungarian government took various military measures, responsible officials here expressed surprise and said that our country has done its best to avoid any actions that could be seen as a threat. The recent slight increase in the number of troops stationed in certain border areas and the conscription of certain types of technical personnel were for two reasons: one is that the international situation is becoming increasingly tense, and the other is that there is war taking place a few miles outside our border (referring to the Hungarian troops entering Carpathian Ruthenia). Previously, some people urged our government to send troops to Carpathian Ruthenia to participate in the war, but the government refused. This shows that we are truly peaceful. It is rather strange that Hungary is now preparing for war near our border. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>German-Romanian Trade Agreement May Be Concluded Soon; German Goods for Crude Oil</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Official sources recently published in the official gazette that the German-Romanian economic negotiations taking place in the Romanian capital have yielded concrete results. Business people believe that the economic agreement must stipulate that Romania will increase its crude oil exports to Germany in exchange for German machinery. (Haitong, 21st)</p>
<p>(Bucharest) It is reported that Romania and Germany have almost finalized a limited trade agreement to be signed on Wednesday. It is also reported that this agreement contains more provisions of the nature of a protocol, and will expand the existing treaty. According to the agreement, Romania will only supply Germany with a small amount of kerosene, which has little to do with what was originally requested. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Bucharest) From the statement made by the official circle that the Romanian and German delegations are expected to conclude a treaty within this week, it can be inferred that Romania will soon hold important commercial negotiations with Germany. It is expected that the trade agreement concluded last November will be completed by the conclusion of this treaty. It is reported that according to the new treaty, the two countries will increase the direct exchange of goods, because Germany is unable to pay in currency, so there is this saying. In general, Germany will obtain more kerosene from Romania's oil wells to be opened or existing oil sources. Well-informed sources say that the only welcomed purpose of the negotiations is to expand trade between the two friendly countries. Romania's relationship with Hungary remains friendly, and orders have been issued to border troops to avoid any unfortunate incidents. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Pittman's New Neutrality Legislation; Senate Foreign Relations Committee to Begin Review Today</h3>
<p>(Washington) Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman submitted a new neutrality bill to Congress yesterday, advocating authorizing the president to take measures to retaliate against aggressor nations. After this bill was introduced, it was opposed by Senator Clark, a Democrat from Missouri, who said that the Pittman bill could easily involve the United States in war. Pittman also admitted this, but said that if this bill were passed during a major war, it would allow democratic countries to gain an advantage. He believes that the "cash and carry" provision would benefit countries that control the seas and provide assistance to Britain and France. The new bill also stipulates that within 30 days after the outbreak of a war, whether declared or undeclared, the US president has the right to declare the countries involved. After this declaration is issued, if US ships transport passengers or goods to any declared country, regardless of whether the transportation method is direct or indirect, it will be considered illegal. Pittman went on to say that he believes that once this bill is passed, it will often be implemented in the Sino-Japanese war. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) Assistant Secretary of State Welles today endorsed the introduction of Senator Pittman's neutrality bill, calling it a step towards legality. The Civil Aeronautics Board is now asking Congress to appropriate $7.3 million to train civilian aviation pilots. At the same time, a bill was also introduced in the House today, advocating the implementation of the War Department's request for $272,000,000 to strengthen the defenses of the Panama Canal.

<h3>Amidst Japan's Southward Advance Policy: The New Situation in the Pacific - The Democratic Bloc Intensifies Efforts to Address Future Wars - German-Japanese Secret Agreement Seeks Hegemony in Eurasia</h3>
<p>Special Correspondence from Hong Kong: The turmoil in the Pacific did not begin today. Over the past seven or eight years, China has been the first to fully play the role of a lamb to the aggressors in the Far East, transforming from a lamb into a fierce tiger during the War of Resistance. However, major powers such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands have consistently sought temporary ease through appeasement and retreat, causing the aggressors' power to expand day by day, and the crisis in the Pacific to deepen day by day. Now, the aggressors' blades are not only directed at China, but also directly threaten all peaceful nations in the Pacific. Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands can no longer seek temporary ease through appeasement, and any further concessions to the aggressors would be tantamount to suicide. This is easily understood. Japan's only way out today is southward expansion. Southward expansion can stimulate domestic morale and cover up the failures of its operations in China; it can threaten Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands to seize the colonial territories of white nations in the Far East; it can coordinate with Germany and Italy's intimidation policies to carry out the common goals of the anti-communist bloc. Apart from southward expansion, what other path is there? Because the war against China has reached an impasse, it has no choice but to shift its political and military strategies, from defending in the south and attacking in the north to defending in the north and attacking in the south, from being pro-British and anti-Soviet to being simultaneously anti-British, anti-French, and anti-Soviet. In other words, it is shifting from a continental offensive to a two-pronged approach of both continental and naval offensives. Before this new policy was decided, it underwent several tests. The landing in Xiamen in May of last year and the occupation of Guangzhou in October were both aimed at testing the reactions of Britain and France. The result was the opposite of the Zhanggufeng Incident; Britain and France softened their stance, and the test was fortunately successful. Thus, on November 3rd of last year, Konoe announced the establishment of a "New Order in East Asia," followed by the continuous concentration of the navy in South China. The recent landing on Hainan Island proves that the southward advance policy has become actively realized. After landing on Hainan Island, Japan immediately proceeded to establish naval and air force bases in Qiongyai, and dispatched experts from Japan to inspect Hainan, demonstrating Japan's intention to permanently occupy it. At the same time, Japan also used its air force to bomb British territory in Kowloon and the New Territories. Japanese Naval Minister Yonai announced that in addition to continuing the 800 million yen naval construction plan that began the previous year, he would specifically request an additional naval construction budget from the parliament at the end of February to compete with Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>French Newspaper Reveals German-Japanese Secret Agreement</p>
<p>Closely related to this southward advance policy are the secret military negotiations that Germany and Japan have been conducting in recent months. It is very clear that Hitler needs Japan to hold back Britain and France in the Far East, just as he needs Fascist Italy to hold back Britain and France in the Mediterranean. Only in this way can Germany greatly extort Britain and France, even more than it did in Munich. However, what tricks the two Fascist countries are playing is currently shrouded in secrecy. Only the French weekly magazine revealed a little information on January 25th, claiming that Germany and Japan signed a secret agreement in Tokyo on November 20th of last year, which stipulated: (1) If Japan is drawn into a new war due to the China Incident, Germany will provide full assistance to Japan with its army, navy, and air force. (2) Within Chinese territory, wherever Japan enjoys economic privileges, Germany will also enjoy the same rights. Germany will also have the right to dispatch technical and military advisors to the "New China" government. (3) If Sakhalin Island and the Soviet Far East territory are placed under Japanese jurisdiction, Germany should be granted concession rights. (4) Germany may restore its pre-war colonies in the Pacific, but only if it does not harm Japan's strategic security. This is the first part of the secret agreement. The second part stipulates the partition of the Malay colonies, with Germany occupying Dutch New Guinea, the western part of Madura Island, the southern part of Celebes Island, Dutch West Indies Suriname, and British Borneo. However, the British Malay Peninsula up to Singapore, Siam, and the rest of the Dutch East Indies are all designated as Japan's sphere of influence. The secret agreement does not mention the division of the Philippines, Hawaii, Vietnam, India, or Burma, supposedly because they are being reserved for Italy to join the German-Japanese secret agreement and redistribute them. Although this is an unconfirmed report, the fact that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita repeatedly advocated strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact at the 74th Diet session, the fact that Germany is preparing to make a new threat to Britain and France regarding colonies in March, and the fact that Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands are actively expanding their military preparations in the Far East all indicate that the news of Germany and Japan partitioning the Pacific colonies is not entirely groundless. Naturally, these provocative acts by Fascist countries are mostly motivated by intimidation at present, because Germany is unwilling to easily launch a war without the certainty of victory. Japan's main intention at present is still to conquer China and has no immediate determination to attack Britain and the United States. However, when a robber encounters someone pointing a loaded gun at him, who can guarantee that danger will not arise? Today it is intimidation, tomorrow it may be war. In short, the towering waves in the Pacific have already been stirred up.</p>
<p>The Far East Situation Affects Europe and America Naturally, all peaceful countries in the Pacific must unite to impose military, economic, and moral sanctions on the aggressors. In this way, there may still be a glimmer of hope for saving peace in the Far East. However, before a major war breaks out in the Pacific, such sanctions are hardly possible. The rulers of the Pacific countries are now thinking about how to launch or how to cope with a future major war in the Pacific, rather than how to promote collective security and peace in the Pacific. As mentioned above, the three countries participating in the Anti-Comintern Pact—Germany, Japan, and Italy—are planning to divide the colonies of white nations in the Pacific, among which Japan is naturally the vanguard of aggression in the Far East. After the landing on Hainan Island, the country ostensibly most threatened is French Vietnam, but this is only for political and strategic needs. Japan only provokes France, as France is the weaker colonial power in the Far East. Vietnam borders China's southwest anti-Japanese base area, and directly threatening Vietnam is equivalent to tightening the blockade of China and indirectly threatening Britain. However, the real target of Japanese aggression is not French Vietnam, but the British Malay Federation, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Australia. The rubber and oil needed by Japanese industry and its ideal population resettlement areas are all in Southeast Asia, while the iron in the Philippines and the abundant minerals and wool in Australia are the main objects of Japanese aggression. In addition, Fascist aggressors also intend to use Siam as an important base for attacking British and French territories. Siamese Prime Minister Pibul publicly announced his admiration for Hitler and Mussolini in a radio speech last year. Recently, the German Wehrmacht's official newspaper also said, "If Siam forms an alliance with Japan, the security of French Vietnam will be completely destroyed." If Siam becomes the Hungary of Asia, not only will Vietnam be lost, but Burma and Singapore will also be in danger of being invaded at any time. Under the encirclement of Japan's southward advance policy and the Fascist bloc's aggression plot, the colonies of Britain, France, and the Netherlands are already under the blade. What policies will Britain, France, and the Netherlands take to protect the security of their territories in the Pacific?</p>
<p>Sincere Cooperation Between Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Although Chamberlain's diplomacy only knew how to make concessions to aggressors, both in the West and in the East, he has recently begun to realize that peace must be maintained by force. If the British Empire uses force to maintain peace, and does not maintain peace by sacrificing small countries, peace can still be maintained. In order to jointly deal with international thugs, Britain will certainly be able to obtain the cooperation of the United States and the Soviet Union, especially China in the War of Resistance, which is the largest pillar of peace in the Far East. The British government will sooner or later understand this point: only by supporting China's War of Resistance with all its strength and sanctioning Japanese aggression can it preserve its vast colonies in the Far East. Even if it does not understand it now, reality will teach Chamberlain to understand. As for France's Far East policy, it is making the same mistake as its Spanish policy, trying to avoid the storm under the broken umbrella of "neutrality," resulting in only benefiting the aggressors. Now that Vietnam is surrounded on three sides by aggressors, France is actively strengthening its land, sea, and air defenses in the Far East. Cam Ranh Bay, opposite Hainan Island, is being built into a first-class naval port. Undoubtedly, France's Far East policy will be strengthened following Britain's. As for the Netherlands, it cannot but rely on Britain militarily. Only recently has The Hague passed a large-scale naval construction plan, which is a bit late, but not too late. Roosevelt's Far East policy is completely correct. In recent months, he has delivered many anti-aggression speeches and established the foundation for a Pan-American anti-aggression front in Lima. He submitted a plan to Congress for the defense of Guam and a new four-year military expansion budget. Roosevelt has already seen that the sword of the Fascist aggressors has not yet touched the United States, so the isolationists controlled by the plutocrats still retain some power. However, it can be determined that the United States' Pacific policy will eventually abandon isolationism and adopt a more ambitious anti-aggression line. As Japan's aggression shifts from northward to southward, the Soviet Union's position in the Far East is strengthening day by day. But at present, the lever of the Pacific problem is China. Precisely because China is fighting for democracy and peace, the various ethnic groups in the Pacific will enjoy democracy and peace because of China's victory in the War of Resistance. The Pacific problem was directly caused by Japan's destruction of China's territorial integrity, and it will only be resolved lastingly and reasonably after China recovers its lost territories.

<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Decides to Establish a Shipping Administration Bureau, Branch Offices to Be Set Up in Various Locations</h3>
<p>Correspondence from Jinhua: The Zhejiang Provincial Government, considering that the province is located in a coastal area with crisscrossing rivers, numerous ports, and a total of 44,000 ships of various types of water transport, but with no established management agency, proposed a resolution at the Provincial Government Committee meeting to establish the Zhejiang Provincial Shipping Administration Bureau. Wei Sicheng, Director of the Highway Administration Bureau, was transferred to be the Director of the Shipping Administration Bureau, and Wang Wenhan was appointed to fill the vacancy left by Wei as Director of the Highway Administration Bureau. Wei is scheduled to hand over his duties on the 15th of this month and then begin preparing for the organization. For the convenience of centralized management, the bureau's location will be set in Jinhua. Under the Director, there will be three sections: General Affairs, Management, and Engineering, as well as an Accounting Office. Five branch offices will be established under these sections, located in Oujiang, Jiaojiang, Yongjiang, Cao'ejiang, and Fuchunjiang, with locations in Yongjia, Linhai, Yin County, Baiguan, and Lanxi, respectively. Wei plans to depart and inspect along the various rivers to formulate a strict management plan.</p>
<h3>Puppet Principal in Qingpu Assassinated and Injured</h3>
<p>Correspondence from Qingpu: On the 15th, Jin Honggao of the First Brigade of the Qingpu Puppet Police held his wedding at his residence on Beimenwai Street. Big and small traitors all went to congratulate him. The puppet police, in order to prevent any incidents, were concentrated in the area of ​​Haimen Bridge and Xu Jing Road, tightening security. At about 4:00 PM, Xu Zhengquan, the puppet county middle school principal and principal of the Qingpu Model Elementary School in the city, was shot and injured outside the school gate. The school gatekeeper heard the noise and went outside, but the shooter had already disappeared. Although the puppet police immediately searched the vicinity, they found no clues. Xu came to Shanghai the morning before yesterday for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Huaihai Lose Contact, Chinese Army Recovers Shuyang, Han Deqin Convenes Military Conference, Fierce Battles in Zhaoguan Dam and Lianshui</h3>
<p>Correspondence from Taixian: After the Japanese troops in Yanshao, northern Jiangsu, suffered a disastrous defeat in their previous attack on Haguan Dam, they attempted to attack again on the 14th, engaging in fierce battles with the Chinese army in the area of ​​Zhaoguan Dam and Qiuyu Ditch. The fighting continued until the morning of the 15th, and the Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties. On the 15th, five civilian boats were sealed off, loaded with Japanese corpses and dead horses, and sent back to Yangzhou City. An elite unit of a certain department of the Chinese army on the northern route went straight to Shuyang County, heavily surrounding the Japanese troops in the city. The Japanese stubbornly resisted with superior weapons, but the Chinese army bravely charged and killed, with one soldier being as good as a hundred. The Japanese troops were unable to hold on and were charged into the city by the Chinese army on the evening of the 13th, taking advantage of the victory to sweep the area, killing more than 200 Japanese soldiers, with corpses strewn everywhere. Few escaped. The county town was recovered, which was enough to cut off the contact line of the Japanese troops in Huaihai, which is of great military significance. The Chinese army is still actively advancing forward, and there will be new developments in the coming days.</p>
<p>Another Dispatch: Since the fall of Huaiyin, Provincial Chairman Han Deqin convened a military conference the day before yesterday. In addition to the officers of the Yu and Miao departments and the Tax Police Corps, the attendees also included Zhu Aizhou, Magistrate of Siyang County, Hong Jiazou, Magistrate of Liuhe County, and Dai Zhiqiang, Magistrate of Yizheng County. They discussed the equipping of troops and the planning of military provisions in detail, and decided that in the shortest possible time, all units would launch a counterattack simultaneously. After the Japanese troops retreated from Huaiyin County, they arrived at Chenjiaji along the Grand Canal, where they were drenched in heavy rain and were in a very embarrassed state. Military vehicles were trapped in the mud. A Chinese army detachment took a shortcut and suddenly surrounded and attacked the embarrassed Japanese troops, causing many casualties. After Funing was captured by the Chinese army, 2,000 Japanese troops engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army in Fangshan Town, north of Lianshui. Japanese planes bombed the areas of Huaiyin, Funing, Yangzhai Town, Goudun, Wuxin Port, and along the Guanhe and Sheyanghe Rivers for days, causing them to become mostly scorched earth, and many innocent civilians were killed and injured.</p>

<h3>The Adaptability of All Things</h3>
<p>— Chen Dong</p>
<p>All changes in the world can be said to be for adapting to the environment. If a person feels hungry, they eat food; if they feel cold, they wear clothes; if they are invaded by germs, their body either develops a fever or their white blood cell count increases. Animals often have camouflage colors to prevent enemies from discovering them. Camels have water sacs in their stomachs because they live in dry places. Plants often have hard-shelled fruits or thorny branches to defend themselves. These are all abilities endowed by nature to the biological world to adapt to the environment.</p>
<p>But strangely enough, even non-living things are endowed with a kind of adaptability. If a person twists a rubber band with their hand, it generates a resistance force. When the hand is released, the rubber band returns to its original shape. This is what we commonly call elasticity. Lengthening and compression have the same result. If we tightly compress a snowball, the snowball shrinks its volume in order to reduce the pressure it receives, so part of the snow melts into water because water has a smaller volume. But if the pressure is suddenly released, the water immediately freezes into a larger volume of ice. When a lever bears a heavy object, it is subjected to pressure. In order to adapt to the environment, the lever bends. Because of the bending, the upper part of the lever lengthens, exerting its tensile force, while the lower part shortens, exerting its compressive force, creating a pair of internal force couples to balance the moment of the external pressure.</p>
<p>The above examples illustrate that all things can adapt to the environment and undergo change. Therefore, when humans are subjected to external aggression and rise up in resistance, it is nothing more than a natural response.</p>
<h3>In Defense of Scientists</h3>
<p>— Shuichang</p>
<p>Since the World War, we have often heard general criticism from society: saying that scientists have committed sins by inventing various lethal weapons for the use of ambitious people, resulting in a situation where "one general succeeds and ten thousand bones are left to rot." In recent years, with many people in East Asia and Western Europe suffering great sacrifices, subjected to the carnage of airplanes, artillery, bombs, and machine guns, the voices blaming scientists have become louder year by year. But these are all temporary emotional reactions that have clouded reason. Many people believe that scientists should bear a kind of responsibility for inventing something new; that they need to prevent knowledge and methods that may be used for killing beforehand; or that they should keep secrets strictly after invention and absolutely not allow others to use them. According to this, our ancient sage Suiren, who invented drilling wood to make fire, committed many sins. He should have foreseen that later people would use fire to kill, and that there would be fire attacks in later tactics, so he shouldn't have drilled any wood.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor invented the chariot, initially pulled by oxen, and later pulled by horses. When two countries fought each other, chariots occupied a very important position. The ancients also said: "The great use of the Rong (barbarians) lies in horses," so Emperor Gaozu of Han had the heroic words "I obtained the world on horseback." It can be seen that chariots and horses were both necessary things for warfare before the 20th century. Chariots should not have been invented in the first place, and horses should not have been domesticated. In ancient times, metal was cast into blades. Blades refer to swords, spears, halberds, and arrows, which can be said to be murderous weapons. Gold is a metal, initially copper, later iron, and finally steel. These metals should not have been invented either.</p>
<p>In the Stone Age, humans used stones as weapons. When everyone learned to use them, in order to resist and survive, they invented the use of bows and arrows. Later, they felt that bows and arrows were not lethal enough, so they invented firearms, such as rockets and fire guns. One step further is the modern gun. Who can say that in the defense against foreign insults, we should not exhaust our efforts to think of various methods of self-defense? If someone said, "We have umbrellas, so it rains in the world," everyone would definitely call him crazy. Then, aren't those who blame scientists and criticize material civilization committing the same mistake?</p>
<p>People who criticize science also insist that modern airplanes and artillery are indeed the crystallization of science. May I ask, what is the difference between creating airplanes for transportation and traffic convenience and the Yellow Emperor making chariots? What is the difference between inventing explosives for opening up mountain mines and subduing fierce beasts and Suiren making fire? Are scientific inventions more beneficial to mankind or more harmful to mankind? Even if scientists are scapegoats, confessing to various unfounded crimes of murder and arson under duress, I'm afraid that when merits and demerits are weighed together, the merits already outweigh the demerits.</p>
<p>Weapons can never be forcibly divided into two types: one for self-defense and one for attacking. Only talking about self-defense without talking about attacking is passive resistance. But absolute passive resistance does not exist. The work of resisting aggression must seek relatively effective methods and strengths of retaliation in order to be sure of success.</p>
<p>In short, scientists can never foresee whether an invention will have improper applications, nor can they prevent an invention from being used by unscrupulous people to do evil. And sometimes, even knowing that an invention may not be beneficial to mankind, because of the special circumstances of the environment, they cannot but strive to proceed. Critics must abandon their subjective attitudes in order to be fair.</p>
<h3>Scientific Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Ji Qian</p>
<p>Great King</p>
<p>Snakes are cold-blooded animals, belonging to reptiles. In the animal kingdom, they are located below birds and above amphibians (frogs, toads, salamanders, etc. all belong to this category). Anyone with a little biological knowledge can say this. However, because our country's science is backward, not only ignorant villagers regard them as divine objects, but even scholar-officials worship them, which is both ridiculous and pitiful. For example, there are several kinds of water snakes in the Yellow River, all of which are small in size. The residents believe they are river gods and call them Great Kings. The external structures of snakes differ from each other, so there are various names for the Great Kings, such as the Yellow Great King, the Chestnut Great King, and the Golden Dragon Great King, which appear from time to time. Snakes also have amphibious habits, sometimes living in water and sometimes on land. Occasionally, they move from the river to the shore, where they are seen by residents, who believe that the Great King has appeared. They must report it to the local officials, who send people to respectfully greet it, place it on a jade plate, cover it with yellow silk, and offer incense and flowers for worship in a special shrine, performing operas and praying for it. Men and women prostrate themselves and worship it in an endless stream. After a few days, the snake disappears without a trace, believing that the Great King has ascended. Officials and commoners are apprehensive, fearing that if their piety is not complete, the Great King will be angry and the Yellow River will burst its banks. Once, a Great King appeared and was welcomed into the temple. The offering of opera was in full swing, and the incense was at its peak when it withered and died in the plate. The officials were all shocked and didn't know what to do, so they summoned the boatmen on the river who specialized in welcoming the Great Kings to inquire. The boatman bowed to the officials and congratulated them, saying, "This is very auspicious. When a Great King sheds its robe, the magistrate will have the joy of promotion." So everyone rejoiced and sent the Great King's remains back to the Yellow River.</p>
<p>General</p>
<p>If the snakes in the Yellow River are Great Kings, then the lizards there are also raised up to be called Generals. Lizards are also one of the reptiles, cold-blooded animals, and are more closely related to crocodiles and turtles. Lizards appear in the Yellow River water and on the shore from time to time, and the residents are also devout in their worship, but not as grand as the ceremonies for offering to the Great King.</p>
<p>Biting a Fox</p>
<p>The theory of fox spirits is deeply believed by a group of ignorant people. Foxes are mammals, belonging to the canidae family in zoology. There are various types, such as the red fox, the blue fox, the silver fox, and the gray fox. Their skins are all valuable. Foxes are the most cunning in nature. Novels often say that they can become immortals. The people of our country lack scientific knowledge and actually believe it is true. In a certain place, there was a horse pen where a groom lived. At night, a fox entered and exited his room. The groom was greatly frightened, suspecting that he was being haunted, and developed a heart disease. The fox also liked to be close to him, so he had many nightmarish dreams, and his illness became more serious day by day, eventually leading to death. The master pitied his poverty and let his younger brother succeed him, but his younger brother also died. So this horse pen became a haunted house, and no one dared to enter it. Later, an old man took the job of grazing the horses. The old man was honest and didn't believe in ghosts or foxes, thinking that fox skins could be used to make fur coats and fox meat could be eaten, so he should catch and cook it to satisfy his stomach. One day, the old man fell asleep, and the fox came to his side, close to his mouth. The old man suddenly bit it, and the fox screamed and fled, with its fur falling off, ink on its teeth, and fresh blood dripping, staining the pillow, and his illness was cured.</p>
<h3>Radio Waves to Be Disrupted by Solar Cataclysm</h3>
<p>Prediction by Italian Seismologist - 25th and 26th of This Month</p>
<p>The appearance of sunspots occurs in a cycle of approximately every eleven years, and it seems that it is reaching its peak intensity within these one or two years, which is what is meant by the so-called solar cataclysm.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Rome Stefani News Agency, seismologist Benddani claims that "a violent solar cataclysm, with an intensity similar to that of last September, is unavoidable. Our Earth will encounter terrible repercussions, especially in disrupting the balance of electromagnetism and radio communications. This disruption will be widespread throughout the world. Shortwave radio will be severely affected, and reception will be impossible on March 25th and 26th." He also said, "Anyone with a shortwave radio can easily detect this phenomenon by tuning between 15 meters and 25 meters. In addition to radio interference, there will also be magnetic storm phenomena and auroras."</p>
<h3>Heavy!</h3>
<p>— (Jin Wu)</p>
<p>Nothing in the world is as heavy as the core of a planet. If your watch were proportionally as heavy to that degree, it would weigh almost a ton and could not be carried. If you put it on the table, it would break the table.</p>
<p>Scientists say that the cores of some planets are so heavy because the material that makes up the core of the planet is much denser than the material on our Earth. In other words, the gaps in that material are extremely small. If you compacted the material that makes up a 180-pound human body so that there were absolutely no gaps inside, then that person would be as small as a pinhead! But this pinhead-sized person would weigh 180 pounds.</p>
<h3>Storing Military Supplies Underwater</h3>
<p>— Yu Shang</p>
<p>Military supplies stored in these giant containers, submerged in water, can avoid enemy aircraft bombing.</p>
<p>Gasoline and food, etc., are extremely important during wartime. They can be stored in giant containers, sunk in lakes or riverbeds one hundred feet or deeper, making them invisible to enemy bombers. This is the conclusion reached by the Swiss authorities after conducting several experiments in Lake Thun. During the experiment, a container with a capacity of 12,000 gallons was sunk to a depth of one hundred feet; according to scouts, when aircraft searched from an altitude of over three thousand feet, they could not see any trace of it. Engineers are now planning to use specially designed rafts to quickly raise and lower the containers.</p>

<h3>World Science News</h3>
<p>The Mother of Airplanes</p>
<p>The ancients said that dragonflies have six legs and four wings, soaring between heaven and earth. Is it possible that today's airplanes took their shape from this? Half a century ago, Professor Langley of the United States, a venerable figure in physics, paid attention to this and devoted his life to studying the art of flying, wanting to create a machine to travel through the clouds. When he studied this art, those who heard of it ridiculed him, thinking it was absolutely impossible. By the time his machine was built, after repeated trials, it was actually able to take off and be controlled, so he demonstrated it to the public. At that time, the viewers were as crowded as walls, all wanting to see what they had never seen before. Unfortunately, the machine he created was relatively heavy, and the pilot was also careless for a moment. As soon as it took off, it crashed into a ship's mast on the river, the fuselage was shattered, and the pilot fell into the river. The audience burst into laughter, and newspapers reported it as a joke. He was nearly seventy years old at the time, and after this failure, he was depressed and soon died of illness. His disciples and old friends all mourned him. However, the principles he published were accurate and indelible, except that his machine was initially made and not as convenient and sophisticated as those of modern times. Later, the Wright brothers devoted themselves to this study, based entirely on Langley's theories, improved and built, and then a new type of aircraft was born; those who followed continued to improve, and the American aircraft manufacturing industry grew stronger day by day. At the end of the European War, the United States joined the war and launched a large-scale training of the air force, with countless airfields in the country, and its largest general airfield was named after Langley (Langley Field) to commemorate his pioneering work. Therefore, although he was unfortunate in his lifetime, he enjoyed great fame after his death, which is enough to comfort those who have worked hard and whose fates have been frustrated.</p>
<p>Ship for Geomagnetic Research</p>
<p>The Earth is a large magnet, and the Earth's surface is a large magnetic field. The magnetic field strength and direction vary from place to place, so it is necessary to measure it from time to time and draw a geomagnetic map for navigators to use. Britain is currently building a ship for measuring geomagnetism, costing 100,000 pounds, named "Research," which will be completed soon. This ship is built entirely of non-magnetic materials. The hull is made of chestnut wood, and the framework and beams are made of bronze or other non-magnetic alloys. Anchors, cables, and all screws are made of bronze, and even kitchen utensils are not made of iron. No crew member is allowed to carry a steel paper cutter. Although the ship is equipped with a heavy oil engine, most of the sailing relies on sails. The displacement is 650 tons, and with enough fuel, it can travel 2,000 miles at a speed of 6 nautical miles per hour. The ship can accommodate 31 crew members and researchers.</p>
<p>This "Research" is the second non-magnetic ship in the world. The first was the American "Carnegie," which was bombed and destroyed in the Samoan Islands in 1929; she had done 25 years of geomagnetic survey work and made a great contribution to countries all over the world.</p>

<p>Rubber Made from Tomatoes</p>
<p>It is said that Italian chemist Dr. Manri has announced that he has completed a secret method to make a natural rubber substitute from tomato skins. Using this method, 400 tons of tomatoes are needed to make one ton of artificial rubber. However, Italy's annual tomato production is only 400,000 tons, so it can only produce 1,000 tons of "rubber," which is very little, only about one-eighth hundredth of the world's total annual natural rubber production.</p>

<h3>Manjusri and Samantabhadra</h3>
<p>— Passerby under the Bridge</p>
<p>Manjusri Bodhisattva and Samantabhadra Bodhisattva are two bodhisattvas. The relationship between bodhisattvas and human life is a fact that cannot be denied now. If you want to relate bodhisattvas to science, I am afraid that the science bosses will be fiercely angry, and the intellectuals will have to curse Amitabha Buddha. Only the abbot will put his hands together and say, good, good, and take the plane. However, Manjusri and Samantabhadra not only still have a relationship with our lives today, but also have a relationship with science precisely because it has come to this day. Which branch of science is related? Genetics, gynecology, obstetrics. Could it be that bodhisattvas keep sons? Oh! This is a great misunderstanding.</p>
<p>When people get married, Manjusri and Samantabhadra are more respected than the officiant, witness, and introducer. They are placed in the center of the hall early, and the guests have to kneel or bow to them. Now you understand, it turns out that this is the so-called harmony. Of course, it is very common to forget one's ancestors, and the old historical basis is waiting for Dr. Hu. Now we only know the meaning of offering harmony, perhaps taking its harmony and union. But the problem arises from here. Are they—Manjusri and Samantabhadra—still husband and wife or monk and nun, or brother and sister? So, using scientific magic weapons and rhetorical means, it may be asserted that they are either sisters or brothers, and there is no other possibility. The origin of this assertion is like this: we first assume that harmony and union are the characteristics of the two people from legends, and secondly, we see that the embroidered portraits on the offering axis have exactly the same appearance and figure. So, according to medical research, they are obviously twins, and they are twins from the same womb. It turns out that twins in the same womb not only have the same appearance and figure, but also the same gender and the same temperament, getting along with each other in perfect harmony. No wonder one becomes a monk and the other also becomes a monk. As for twins with different wombs, that is, twins with two wombs, their gender does not have to be the same, and their temperament does not have to be the same. They often hate and envy each other. According to obstetrical statistics, on average, there is one case of twins out of every eighty births, although it does not have to be twins from the same womb, but it can be determined that there must have been more than one pair of Manjusri and Samantabhadra from ancient times to the present. However, only Manjusri and Samantabhadra participate in weddings in the name of harmony. Why is this so? I think Mencius' words can be borrowed: Zhou's wickedness is not so great; Zhou can represent all bad things and all bad people. This is the emperor's position that made him so. Manjusri and Samantabhadra became bodhisattvas, and their position is not necessarily below the emperor. They represent all fraternal twins. It is possible. So, why do we worship twins as idols? Because twins are relatively rare, rare things are often regarded by people as special magic power, so they are revered and idolized. This is the same at home and abroad. Harmony is a relic of the worship of twins, and this point is probably not wrong.</p>
<p>Today, genetics is advancing and taking the study of twins as one of the important bases, and conception and childbirth belong to the scope of obstetrics and gynecology, making Manjusri and Samantabhadra wear cassocks on the outside and swallowtails on the inside, which are all driven by the times, which is also unique and gratifying.</p>
<h3>Land Sailing</h3>
<p>— Da Xing</p>
<p>Even if you are a novice cyclist, you should have experienced the power of headwinds. If the wind is a little strong, you must spend a lot of effort to step forward. If the wind is even stronger, you will feel like you cannot move forward. At that time, you have to dismount, pull the horse forward, and shout repeatedly: "Tiring me! Tiring me!"</p>
<p>However, if it is a tailwind, then you don't have to work hard. The wind will push your back and head straight for Sunjia Village, and you will shout repeatedly: "How pleasant this wind is!"</p>
<p>Now, a slight push on the back is enough for you to ride the wind and waves; if you raise a sail on the car, wouldn't it be even faster? Two teenagers in Florida, USA, did just that, and as a result, they actually realized the miracle of land sailing. This photo was taken when they passed through a street in Miami.</p>

<p>Third Plenary Session on the Fourth Day General Assembly Continues to Report</p>
<p>March 4th was the fourth day of the Third National Education Conference. The third plenary session was held at 8:00 AM, and group meetings were held in the afternoon. The chairman of the general meeting was Vice Chairman Chiang Menglin. The agenda was as follows: (1) Performing rituals as usual, (2) Reading the minutes of the preparatory meeting and the first and second meetings, (3) The chairman reported that President Kong of the Executive Yuan and President of the Supervisory Yuan attended the meeting to participate in the guidance, and everyone applauded to welcome them, (4) The secretary-general reported three documents, (5) The chairman reported that in accordance with the education report schedule issued at the first meeting, the persons in charge or representatives of each education agency and college would continue to report on the education status of each college. The report then began. The first was the National Zhongzheng Medical College, the second was the Guizhou Provincial Department of Education, the third was the National Jiaotong University Tangshan Engineering College, the fourth was the National Pharmaceutical College, the fifth was the Xikang Department of Education, the sixth was the National Shanghai Business College, the seventh was the National Guiyang Medical College, the eighth was the Qingdao Municipal Education Bureau, the ninth was the National Shanghai Medical College, the tenth was the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, the eleventh was the Ningxia Department of Education, the twelfth was the National Central Library Preparatory Office, the thirteenth was the Qinghai Provincial Department of Education, the fourteenth was the National Central Museum Preparatory Office, the fifteenth was the Liaoning Provincial Department of Education, the sixteenth was the Jilin Provincial Department of Education, the seventeenth was the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Education, and the eighteenth was the Rehe Provincial Department of Education.

<p>Chairman Chiang Attends the Meeting and Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>The reports on this day were limited to six minutes each. At five minutes, a bell rang to indicate a preview, so the reports ended quickly. After a ten-minute break, it was already 11:00 AM. President Chiang, wearing a grass-green military uniform, arrived with a smile on his face. Everyone stood up to show their respect. The President nodded to the crowd and said, "Please sit down." He then began his speech, first describing the history of the education conference. This meeting has been eight years since the second meeting. Its mission is great, and it is responsible for saving the country and building the country. This means that we must identify a clear goal in education. We should take the Three People's Principles of revolutionary national salvation as the highest standard of education in our country and create a new life for a modern country. The vitality of a modern country is composed of three elements: education, economy, and military force. Education is the foundation of all undertakings, and it can also be said that education is the hub connecting the economy and military force. Therefore, we must take developing the economy and strengthening the military force as the direction of our education. Currently, the most heatedly debated issue in education is the issue of wartime education and peacetime education. I often say, "Peacetime should be regarded as wartime, and wartime should be regarded as peacetime." I also often say, "Wartime life is modern life. In the present era, whether it is an individual or a society, if it does not practice wartime life, it cannot exist and will be eliminated and destroyed." If we understand this meaning, then there is no need for the so-called debate between peacetime education and wartime education.</p>
<p>In order to adapt to the needs of today and conform to the environment of today, we should use the methods of extraordinary times to achieve the original purpose of education, use extraordinary spirit to expand the effect of education, such as our schools at all levels at this time should strive for equipment economy, simple and hard living, and the example of the ancients drawing reeds to teach their children, and catching fireflies to reflect the snow, can be used to inspire and encourage us. In short, do not forget that wartime should be regarded as peacetime, and do not abandon the basics for the sake of emergency. Regarding all specific programs in education, I will not discuss them one by one, but I hope that you will focus on the most basic point, that is, to strengthen the will of our people nationwide and establish our spirit of actively building the country, especially to improve the inherent morality of our nation at all times. We all know that our country is a country lacking in material conditions. In this dangerous and difficult autumn, we should shoulder this extraordinary and huge responsibility. If we do not overcome material goods with spirit, it will not be easy to survive. If we do not use the inherent morality and revolutionary spirit of our nation, if we do not generate this power and create materials through this spirit, it will not be easy to achieve the success of building the country. I believe that as of today, the life of all educators should no longer be like the past, teaching behind closed doors and enjoying a leisurely life. Educators should not only transmit knowledge according to the curriculum and regard it as a basis for personal life or a private career. Today's educators should recognize themselves as soldiers who break through the enemy's defenses, as social mentors who change customs, as pioneers who overcome difficulties, and as sages and heroes who continue the lost and preserve the extinct. We can no longer agree with the past misunderstanding of the independence of education and become an isolated group. Today, when we talk about education, we should integrate education with military, political, social, and economic undertakings.</p>
<p>We should create students who have the awareness and ability to defend the country, defend themselves, and govern the country themselves. We must implement what is said in the Book of Rites, "To be a teacher and then to be a leader", and integrate with politics and society to take responsibility for organizing the people. The ancients said, "Observe each other and do good." How can educators bear to see the ignorance and suffering of the general public in society? I especially need to root in the needs of national economic construction, teach the people to value labor and be able to produce, and especially encourage creativity. All education plans should be coordinated with economic plans, and then our education can become a factor in creating the vitality of a modern country. He then encouraged three things. The first thing is to recognize the meaning of respecting teachers and valuing education, and set an example for young people to influence the people. The second thing is to cultivate national personality standards, and take propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor as the common school motto for schools at all levels. The third thing is to unify the trend, concentrate the goals, and strive to realize the Three People's Principles. Finally, I hope that my colleagues in the education sector will be self-reliant, respect themselves, be focused and consistent, and contribute their lives to the great cause of educating the country. (Editor's note: The original text of Chairman Chiang's speech has been published in this newspaper on March 5th.)</p>
<p>Chairman Lin and Others Entertain Members</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM, the review meetings of each group continued. At 4:30 PM, they went to Chairman Lin of the National Government's tea party. Chairman Lin had high hopes for the education conference. "Creating human villages" was the central meaning of his speech. Vice Chairman Chiang took education as a part of politics, and in the future, he should follow the training and handle education as a response. The tea party was elegantly decorated and was all made in China. The most notable thing was the colorful porcelain bowls and dishes. Chongqing has this, which can be said to be a valuable item. In the evening, Minister Ye Chucang of the Propaganda Department hosted a banquet at the Guotai Restaurant. Many of those invited were directors of education.</p>

<h3>British Businesses Lodge Strong Protest Against Japanese Puppet Regime's Currency Control, Believing That Japanese Puppets Discriminate Against British Interests, Favoring Japanese Financial Monopoly, Protest Letter Issued by British Chamber of Commerce in the Form of a Announcement</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that the Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce lodged a strong protest against the "Provisional Government's" implementation of the new currency regulations in North China. The protest was issued in the form of an announcement by the Chairman of the Chamber, Sir Marshal, expressing the Chamber's views, stating that this new method was indeed discriminatory against British interests and the most heinous attack on the "Open Door" policy. According to the announcement, on the 11th of this month, the "North China Provisional Government" promulgated currency control regulations, which have been implemented in all important cities and ports controlled by the Japanese army in North China, including Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and Weihaiwei. These regulations intend to force the use of "United Reserve" banknotes, which are linked to the Japanese yen, have no adequate reserve as backing, and have no value in foreign exchange. In order to establish the circulation of "United Reserve" currency, the customs prohibits the export of certain goods, including the main export products of North China, must be processed by the Yokohama Specie Bank at the "United Reserve Bank's" exchange rate of fourteen pence before they can be transported out. This regulation automatically establishes a financial monopoly that favors Japanese banks. If commerce can continue on this basis, it will be providing foreign exchange backed by the "United Reserve Bank" currency, which is insufficient to guarantee. The only result of this attempt to stabilize the "United Reserve" currency will be to halt general trade, and may even cause many foreign commercial firms to close down, because foreign merchants cannot operate with currencies that cannot be freely exchanged for foreign exchange. As for the Japanese, their position is slightly different, because they trade with "United Reserve Bank" banknotes, accepting this kind of banknote can purchase supplementary goods from Japan. These regulations will first affect the exporters of Chinese products, but importers of foreign goods (excluding Japanese goods) will soon be affected as well. It is not guaranteed that even if foreign exchange is obtained through exports, it can be used to pay for import prices. As a result, the amount of all imported goods other than Japanese goods will be reduced immediately. Furthermore, even if importers can obtain some foreign exchange, it is difficult to allocate it due to insufficient exchange, and they will be manipulated by the "United Reserve Bank's" unified control and restrictions on foreign imports. This method is in conflict with existing treaties. Therefore, the attempt to enforce unbacked currency in North China will inevitably have a dangerous impact on British merchants' replenishment and sales procedures. If the Japanese succeed in promoting the circulation of a currency linked to the Japanese yen in China, they will place foreign merchants in an unfavorable position, similar to foreign merchants in the Three Eastern Provinces. Therefore, these regulations are indeed discriminatory against British interests and the most heinous attack on the Open Door policy and the principle of equal opportunity, and all efforts should be made to ensure that it fails completely. The British Chamber of Commerce lodges a strong protest against this reckless plan, because this plan will not only damage British interests in North China, but also damage all other non-Japanese interests, and may eventually be affected by its damage in a wider territory.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Local Memorial: Flags Hung to Celebrate, Promoting the Spirit of Restoration and Supporting the Government's War of Resistance</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the "March 21st" local memorial day in this city, which was the 12th anniversary of the National Revolutionary Army's arrival in Shanghai.

On this glorious memorial, looking back on the past and thinking about the present, I felt even more excited and painful. At this time when the soldiers on the front line were fighting bloody battles and continuing their efforts, the whole people decided to fully support the government and complete the war of resistance, and continue to promote the "March 21st" spirit of restoration, so as to dispel the haze and re-gamble on the light.</p>

Yesterday (the 21st), it was rumored that Japanese troops were again attempting to land on the south bank of the Qiantang River, in a certain area of Xiaoshan County. Japanese planes flew to Wenzhou and indiscriminately bombed the area. The military authorities in eastern Zhejiang have deployed heavy troops along the river and coastal areas, standing ready for battle. The Yong and Ou Rivers will be completely blockaded if necessary. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Concentrate in Eastern Zhejiang</p>
<p>Starting on the 18th of last month, Japanese warships concentrated in Jiaojiang, attempting to land at Haimen. After being repelled by the stationed troops, they dispatched more than ten Japanese warships to patrol the waters of eastern Zhejiang, constantly probing Zhenhai, Xiangshan, Shipu, Chuanshan, Sanmenhong, Haimen, and other places, arbitrarily firing artillery and bombing various locations. They sent planes to reconnoiter and bomb Haimen, Linpu, Jinhua, Lanxi, Zhuji, and other places. Since the 19th, when Japanese warships fired over 400 shells at Zhenhai, the number of Japanese warships patrolling the waters of eastern Zhejiang has increased to several.</p>
<p>Attempted Sneak Crossing of the Qiantang River</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 21st), it was widely rumored that Japanese troops had already attempted to land in a certain area of Xiaoshan County via a sneak crossing of the Qiantang River from Hangzhou yesterday morning. The landing attempt was met with a fierce counterattack by the stationed troops. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency specifically inquired with the Shaoxing Seven County Fellow Villagers Association and various shipping companies yesterday, but received no detailed telegrams. They have already telegraphed Ningbo from various locations to inquire about the truth. However, the south bank of the Qiantang River, including Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, Yuyao, Ningbo, Cixi, and other counties, is within the war zone. Under the command of General Commander Liu of the Tenth Army Group, defensive works have been built along the river, with heavy troops stationed, standing ready for battle.</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Bomb Wenzhou</p>
<p>Jinhua, Lanxi, Quzhou, and other places in eastern Zhejiang are frequently bombed by Japanese planes. Japanese planes fly to various locations in eastern Zhejiang for reconnaissance almost every day. On the 19th of this month, Haimen and Linpu were bombed by Japanese planes, but fortunately, the bombs fell on barren land, causing minimal damage. Yesterday (the 20th) at 9:00 AM, it was reported that four Japanese planes flew to Wenzhou and indiscriminately bombed the urban area, resulting in over twenty civilian casualties. The Xiadong Street suffered heavy losses. However, detailed information has not yet been received by telegram. Shipping to and from Wenzhou remains open. The Baoli Wheel of the Italian merchant firm Yihua has already sailed to Wenzhou at 3:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Evacuation of City Residents Completed</p>
<p>The Chinese military authorities have long had concrete plans for the defense of eastern Zhejiang. The south bank of the Qiantang River and various coastal ports are under the strict guard of the defense commanders of Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo. After Haimen and Zhenhai were bombed by Japanese warships, the populations within the cities had already been completely evacuated. Now, major coastal and riverside cities such as Ningbo and Wenzhou have also been ordered to evacuate, and special martial law has been issued, stipulating that from 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM the following morning, no one is allowed to pass without a special permit and password.</p>
<p>Preparation for Blocking Rivers</p>
<p>Although the Yong River in Ningbo, the Jiao River in Haimen, and the Ou River in Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang have already been blockaded, gaps have been left in the blockade lines of the Yong and Ou Rivers to maintain navigation and transportation. Now, due to the tense situation in eastern Zhejiang, the Ningbo and Wenzhou defense commanders have received orders to prepare everything. When necessary, the Yong and Ou Rivers will be completely blockaded. At the Zhenhai blockade line of the Yong River, the old Taiping Wheel has been anchored beside the blockade line, serving to close the gaps in the blockade line. Mines have already been laid in the Ou River.</p>
<p>Moving Stockpiled Goods in Ningbo and Wenzhou</p>
<p>The chambers of commerce in Ningbo and Wenzhou have received orders to notify various industries to quickly move stockpiled goods in Ningbo and Wenzhou to safer areas. Therefore, the Wenzhou and Ningbo communities in Shanghai have temporarily suspended purchasing goods starting yesterday. However, essential goods are still being purchased. It is heard that the Wenzhou Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of various industries a few days ago to move goods from the Wenzhou docks and urban areas. The number of goods shipped from Shanghai to Wenzhou and Ningbo has decreased significantly in recent days, while the number of passengers traveling from Wenzhou and Ningbo to Shanghai has surged, mostly women and young children.</p>
<p>Shipping Routes Remain Open</p>
<p>Although there is talk of completely blockading the Yong River and Ou River, it has not yet been implemented as of last night. The Deping Wheel of the Sino-Italian Company and the Hana Wheel of the Far East Company both reported to Shanghai by telegram yesterday that they had safely arrived in Ningbo yesterday morning. However, the Ender Wheel of the Sino-Italian Company is scheduled to sail from Ningbo to Shanghai today (the 22nd), but there has been no telegram report. The Tangsai Wheel of the Huamei Company will sail from Shanghai to Ningbo today (the 22nd), and the Shantait Wheel of the Zhengde Company will sail from Shanghai to Ningbo tomorrow (the 23rd). As for the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, the Baoli Wheel of the Yihua Company, the Meida Wheel of the Meili Company, and the Tangbei Wheel of the Huamei Company sailed to Wenzhou yesterday (the 21st). Those sailing to Wenzhou today (the 22nd) are the Feikang Wheel of the Lulin Company, the Meifa Wheel of the Meili Company, and the Tangqiao Wheel of the Huamei Company.</p>
<h3>American Books Shipped to Shanghai Again Torn and Confiscated; Five Volumes of "World Propaganda" Confiscated; Lin Yutang's Work Torn Out; Sino-American Book Company Asks US Consulate to Intervene</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, Mortimer, the owner of the Sino-American Book Company at 160 Nanjing Road, has lodged a second protest within five months with the American authorities in Shanghai regarding the illegal confiscation and tearing of American books and magazines sent here by Japanese inspectors. This protest was filed with the US Consul General Gauss on Saturday morning and has not yet received a response. It is said that the authorities have no time to handle it. The incident involves the confiscation of five volumes of "World Propaganda" by Rice and Huell sent here. Sixteen pages of an article by Lin Yutang entitled "The Birth of New China" published in the supplementary pages of the March issue of "Asia" magazine were torn out. The most recent shipment of American books and magazines arrived in Shanghai on Thursday morning aboard the President Pierce. A package addressed to the Sino-American Book Company was delivered to the company the following day. It was immediately discovered that five books were missing, and the supplementary pages originally in the center of "Asia" magazine had been torn out. Judging from the wrinkles in the ropes wrapping the books and the package's ropes, it is evident that five books were missing. The five volumes of "World Propaganda" were divided into five packages, each containing a novel. Although the novels were delivered to their destination, the books by Rice and Huell did not arrive. The Sino-American Company only received nine copies out of the ten copies of "Asia" magazine originally sent. Magazines sent from the United States are usually rolled up in paper. However, when the Sino-American Company received them, the paper was torn. The post office never unwraps and sends rolled magazines because their ends are not sealed. Therefore, the opening of the magazines immediately aroused suspicion. It was then discovered that an article by Lin Yutang occupying sixteen supplementary pages had been torn out. Yesterday, it was learned that the Dahua Magazine Company at 714 Sichuan Road had also been treated similarly. However, the British firm Biefa Company at 66 Nanjing Road claimed that their mail had not been tampered with. According to the Sino-American Company, this is the second time in five months that they have complained to the American authorities. Last autumn, Mortimer protested the confiscation of Carl Crow's "I Speak for the Chinese" and the tearing out of Pearl S. Buck's article in "Reader's Digest."</p>
<h3>Overview of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Department Annual Report; Foreign Field Staff Make Steady Progress in Learning Chinese</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Department report for 1938 states that the mission of the Chinese language instruction section is to teach every foreign field staff member (including Japanese and Indian personnel) of the Bureau, as much as possible, in the local dialect of Shanghai and the national language of China. Each student is given a three-year tuition fee by the Bureau and an hour's leave each day to study Chinese. Last year there were 25 instructors. To save time, effort, and expense, the Bureau is now using an accelerated and direct approach, ensuring that each student's Chinese language learning is limited to matters related to their duties, with the rest left to them to choose on their own. Students who have studied for three years but fail the highest-level examination may continue to study for an additional year at most. After that, if they still fail, their Chinese language subsidy will be cancelled, and they must pay their own tuition and continue to study in their own time until they pass. Although the situation was not stable last year, the Bureau's staff made steady progress in learning Chinese, which is very satisfactory. The translation section of the Department is divided into two parts: one part translates Chinese documents into English, and the other translates English documents into Chinese. The purpose of dividing into two parts is to make the best use of everyone's strengths in order to translate as quickly as possible, and the results are still excellent.</p>

<h3>The Huanghuagang Memorial Day is Approaching; All Circles Prepare to Commemorate with Grief; Will Automatically Lower Flags, Suspend Entertainment, and Implement National Spiritual Mobilization</h3>
<p>The 29th of this month is the Huanghuagang Seventy-Two Martyrs' Revolution Memorial Day. All circles in Shanghai are preparing to commemorate with grief to pay tribute to the martyrs, strive for the final victory, complete the great task of nation-building, continue to promote frugality, contribute to disaster relief, and implement spiritual mobilization. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>All Circles Prepare to Commemorate with Grief</p>
<p>All circles in Shanghai will observe the Huanghuagang Revolution Memorial Day on the 29th of this month. As the war of resistance enters its second phase, the invaders have not been eliminated, the rivers and mountains have not been recovered, and millions of compatriots have suffered from trampling. Recalling the heroic sacrifice of the revolutionary martyrs and their great spirit of martyrdom inspires infinite admiration and worship. Therefore, to express grief, it has been decided to automatically commemorate with grief on this day. All agencies, organizations, schools, shops, and households in the city will lower their flags and suspend banquets and entertainment for one day. Amusement venues are also said to be planning to voluntarily close to express their condolences.</p>
<p>Implement National Spiritual Mobilization</p>
<p>At the same time, all circles are determined to express their support for the national policy of resistance by taking action to commemorate the revolutionary martyrs. Therefore, in addition to continuing to promote various movements such as frugality for disaster relief and contributing funds, in order to concentrate material resources, contribute to the country, and strengthen the power of resistance, they will also implement national spiritual mobilization. Every citizen must deeply understand the supreme importance of the nation, the supreme importance of the race, military first, victory first, concentration of power, and concentration of will, and unanimously exert great spiritual power to strive for the final victory and complete the great task of nation-building. Regarding the implementation methods, various organizations such as agriculture, industry, commerce, and education are currently discussing and preparing to form a National Spiritual Mobilization Association to supervise the progress.</p>
<h3>British Fleet Commander Holt Goes to Nanjing</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, Rear Admiral Holt, commander of the British Yangtze River Fleet, arrived in Nanjing yesterday (the 20th) aboard his flagship HMS Scorpion. He plans to stay there for four days before returning to Shanghai, probably arriving around the 26th of this month.</p>
<h3>Dr. Baker's Impressions of Inspecting North China: Severe Flooding Makes Relief Extremely Difficult; The Japanese-Puppet Regime's Prohibition of Legal Tender Has Been a Miserable Failure; There Are No Smiles on the Faces of People in North China</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, Dr. Baker, General Manager of the China International Famine Relief Commission, returned to Shanghai yesterday (the 20th) after a three-week inspection of North China. He told reporters that although the flood situation in North China this year is not as serious as in previous years, most of the people in the area still need to be rescued. The winter harvest is abundant, but farmers' incomes have decreased because only the Japanese army buys cotton, and the Japanese army only pays one-third of the price of cotton. At present, the Japanese army and bandits in North China are spread all over the place, so rescuing farmers is a difficult task. It is no longer safe for those who carry money into the countryside, and valuable items are almost certain to be robbed by bandits. The sluggishness of commerce in small counties is also one of the reasons why this task is difficult. Since money cannot be taken into each county, and there is a lack of banking facilities in these areas, remittances are also impossible. As for the flood situation, a vast area in the shape of a crescent moon to the west, south, and north of Tianjin is still a swamp. Due to the lack of good maps and the inability to reach the countryside, it is difficult to determine the exact extent of the flooding. At present, most of the relief work in North China is handled by missionaries. The organization responsible for handling this work is the North China Adjustment Committee, which is headquartered in Beiping. Foreign churches are all participating in the relief work, and branches of the committee have been established in all major cities. Dr. Baker also said that while he was in North China, the Japanese implemented a new currency method, the purpose of which was to harm the value of China's legal tender. However, the implementation of this measure to date has been a miserable failure. Not only has it failed to stop the circulation of legal tender, but it has also helped to raise the premium of legal tender, which has already risen. The purpose of this method promoted by the Japanese side is to prohibit the public from circulating legal tender. In name, anyone found carrying a single piece of legal tender worth one dime will be fined 10,000 yuan. However, if someone is found by guerrillas to be carrying "joint notes," they will be executed. Foreign businesses are indeed at a standstill. Foreigners now clearly understand that all businesses will eventually be completely controlled by the Japanese. Foreign businesses are now waiting for development. Regarding the Japanese monopoly on wool, Dr. Baker believes that this move will be difficult to achieve. Shops that weave blankets can no longer buy wool on the market. Transportation methods have improved slightly recently, but trains only run during the day and stop running at night. Attacks by guerrillas on stations still occur. Strong fortifications can be seen along the railway, and important locations along the transportation lines are now guarded by the Japanese army and members of the Red Spear Society. Dr. Baker also criticized the morale of the people, saying that very few people show smiles, and no one is seen riding horses on the streets. This shows that they are not forgetting their worries. Many houses are being built in Beiping, mostly owned by Japanese people. Rents have increased sharply, but salaries have also increased. Military trucks in Beiping often drive by in columns, causing severe traffic congestion. A number of Japanese geishas now live in Beiping, and Japanese-owned shops are also increasing rapidly.</p>
<h3>French Ambassador Cosme Arrives in Shanghai from Chongqing</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, Cosme, the newly appointed French Ambassador to China who recently presented his credentials to the National Government, is scheduled to leave Chongqing tomorrow (the 22nd) and come to Shanghai via Kunming and Hanoi.</p>
<h3>Another Four Hundred Jewish Refugees Arrive</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, another four hundred German and Austrian refugees arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 20th) aboard the Victoria, bringing the number of Jewish refugees in Shanghai to almost six thousand four hundred. Members of the committee in charge of taking care of these refugees went to the customs pier as usual to receive them and send them to prepared housing to live in.</p>
<h3>Commander of the British East Surrey Regiment, Ackden, Returns Home</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, Lieutenant Colonel Ackden, commander of the 2nd Battalion of the British East Surrey Regiment, which is stationed in Shanghai, has completed his four-year term of office and has been relieved of his duties. He will take the Taikang to Hong Kong at 11:00 AM today (the 21st), stay for three days, and then take the troopship Lancashire back to England. After Ackden leaves Shanghai, his vacancy will be filled by Major Swinton. When the 2nd Battalion arrived in Shanghai last November, Ackden stayed in England due to illness and was temporarily replaced by Swinton as commander. During Ackden's trip to Hong Kong, Major General Grasset, commander of the British forces in China, will host a banquet for him. The command of the British forces in Shanghai will now be temporarily held by Lieutenant Colonel Murray, commander of the 1st Battalion and the West Yorkshire Regiment. The new commander, Colonel Simmons, will come to Shanghai in June.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Formally Replies Refusing to Purchase Rice from Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the Soybean and Rice Industry Association, Ningbo is experiencing a shortage of rice, and the Ningbo Rice Industry Association sent a letter to the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai requesting assistance in obtaining supplies in Shanghai. This matter has been rejected by the Soybean and Rice Industry Association. It is reported that the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai has formally replied to the Ningbo Rice Industry Association yesterday to inform them.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Institute of Engineers Establishes a Hong Kong Branch; Wu Yunzhu Elected President</h3>
<p>Since the Chinese Institute of Engineers moved its headquarters from Shanghai to Chongqing, it has also prepared to establish branches in Kunming, Guilin, Guizhou, Xi'an, Lanzhou, and other places. The Hong Kong branch was officially established on March 1st. On that day, the inaugural meeting was held on the second floor of the Winslow Hotel on Avenue Central. Huang Boqiao stood up and nominated Dr. Hu Ruixiang as the temporary chairman. Shen Yi reported on the preparations, passed the articles of association, and elected Wu Yunzhu as the president of the Hong Kong branch, Bao Shushu as the vice president, Wu Damu as the treasurer, and Zhang Tingxiang as the secretary.</p>
<h3>The Huzhou Express Boat is Scheduled to Sail Tomorrow; There is No Certainty Whether It Will Proceed</h3>
<p>For the past three days, the Pinghu class ships of the Dazhong and Pinghe companies have been suspended because the stationed troops in Songjiang, Taolaimiao, Jinshan, Xinjin, and other ports along the route have prohibited ships from sailing. The Huzhou express boat of the Shanghai Inland River Steamship Company is scheduled to sail from the Suzhou River to Wujiang, Pingwang, Zhenze, Nanxun, and Wuxing tomorrow (the 23rd). It is unknown whether it will depart as scheduled. However, goods bound for Huzhou are piled up at the wharf.</p>
<h3>You Jusun, Tao Xiaojie, and Others Form "Cotton Production and Sales Market"; Buy Cotton to Supply the Japanese Side; Business Circles Pay Close Attention</h3>
<p>According to Modern News, since the War of Resistance, our government and people, in order to prevent the invaders from using the means of using Chinese to control the Chinese, have stopped exporting industrial and military materials to avoid them being used by the enemy. However, shameless traitors are willing to recognize thieves as fathers. Recently, Yun Jusun, Tao Xiaojie, and others, under "orders," organized the "China Cotton Production and Sales Market" in Shanghai, with a capital of 15 million yuan. It was established this month to buy our cotton products to supply the Japanese. Business circles in Shanghai are paying close attention and are discussing effective countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Various Provinces Establish Food Agencies to Be Responsible for Transportation and Sales to Maintain People's Food Supply; Agricultural Warehouses Established Everywhere to Store Grain; Overseas Chinese in Siam Transport Rice Back to the Country to Handle Price Stabilization</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Economic Affairs stipulated food regulation measures, provincial governments established food transportation and sales agencies, assessed prices to maintain the people's food supply, cracked down on hoarding and speculative manipulation, and encouraged morning people to grow rice. A rice shortage occurred in South China, and overseas Chinese in Siam transported rice to handle price stabilization. There will be no shortage of food in the future. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Various Provinces Establish Transportation and Sales Agencies</p>
<p>All provincial governments have established food transportation and sales agencies in the provincial capital and in larger counties or important grain distribution areas under their jurisdiction. They are responsible for regulating food surpluses and shortages within the territory, assessing rice prices, ordering firms to transport according to regulations, cracking down on rice merchants hoarding and speculating, and registering grain merchants, warehouses, stacks, and factories. They order them to report purchase, sales, and inventory quantities at any time, stipulating that various firms, etc., may not close down, suspend business, or stop work without the approval of the food regulation agency. They determine the amount of food required for several months according to the population ratio and are responsible for storing it.</p>
<p>Agricultural Warehouses Established Everywhere to Store Grain</p>
<p>Zhejiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, and other provinces are actively advocating and urging the widespread establishment of agricultural warehouses to store and mortgage grain. The agricultural warehouses in various places are divided into (1) warehouses operated by the Agricultural Bank itself, (2) agricultural warehouses established by various provincial governments, (3) warehouses established by various banks and money shops, and (4) simple morning warehouses established by various local groups and people. Starting this year, various provinces will do their best to encourage farmers to grow rice, limit cotton fields and winemaking, prohibit other improper consumption, advocate that people voluntarily save food, and promote changes in food types or ingredients, so that there will be no shortage of military and civilian food in the future.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Siam Transport Rice to Handle Price Stabilization</p>
<p>The government has prohibited the export and transshipment of grain to occupied areas, and ordered the South China Rice Industry Company to be responsible for regulating the food supply for the people in South China. This year, a rice shortage occurred in Shantou and other places. Overseas Chinese in Siam organized the Siam Price Stabilization Rice Industry Company and set up offices in Shantou and other places to purchase Siamese rice and transport it to South China for price stabilization. All transportation costs, etc., are subsidized by the company. The first batch of 15,000 bags and the second batch of 10,000 bags have all arrived in Shantou and are being implemented for price stabilization in various counties of Chaoshan, distributed according to the population ratio of each county. It is stipulated that the price per Sima scale is 8 yuan and 40 cents in national currency.</p>
<p>Grain Funds Bank Loans</p>
<p>The food transportation and sales agencies established by various provinces and the agricultural warehouses established by themselves are stipulated not to aim at making profits. As for the funds for grain warehouses, in addition to a part being raised by the governments themselves, the rest has been loaned by the Ministry to various local or provincial banks. At the same time, various commercial banks are making every effort to expand their grain mortgage business. Special accommodation and interest rate reductions will be given to requests for mortgage loans for grain. In the future, most of the agricultural products and grains stored in the banks and agricultural warehouses in various provinces, including wheat, rice, beans, etc., will be mortgaged.</p>
<h3>The Post Office Stops Accepting Heavyweight Mail to Hankou; Printing Samples Are Rejected; Aviation Stationery and Envelopes are Sold</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration received a report from the Hankou Post Office stating that due to traffic congestion and transportation difficulties, it has been decided that from now on, the post office will temporarily stop accepting and sending all heavyweight items to Hankou, except for letters and postcards, such as printed matter and commodity samples. Regarding aviation envelopes and stationery, the Bureau previously sold them at various post offices. Recently, in view of the fact that these stationery and envelopes are too heavy and hinder delivery, they have been revised and are now completed and on sale. One envelope and two sheets of stationery are sold as a set for 2 cents in national currency. The Bureau will issue a notice within a few days.</p>
<h3>The YMCA Holds Life Guidance and Promotes Art Education</h3>

<h3>Traveler Wang Jieren Assassinated at Huizhong Hostel</h3>
<p>Shot in the Head, Died Instantly</p>
<p>Rumor Has It That the Deceased Was the Puppet "Director of Shipping"</p>
<p>At approximately 9:20 AM yesterday morning, a shooting occurred on the second floor of the New Huizhong Hostel at 515 Hankou Road. The victim was Wang Jieren, a puppet in the puppet organization. On the afternoon of the 17th of this month, a male guest arrived at the hostel and was accompanied by the clerk to room 241 on the second floor for lodging. The guest himself wrote "Wang Jieren, 40 years old, local, businessman" in the registration book. Over the past few days, many visitors came and went, seemingly discussing business transactions. The night before last, he had played cards with several friends until late at night. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Wang got up and was washing when a male guest named Huang Lucai came to visit. After the tea attendant reported it, Wang Jieren, who had just finished washing and was only wearing a coffee-colored knitted jacket and pants, invited the guest in. Because the guest was an acquaintance, they sat down and chatted. Unexpectedly, another man wearing a blue cloth gown suddenly barged into the room and asked, "Is Mr. Wang here?" Wang replied, "That's me." Before he could finish speaking, the man pulled out a pistol and fired at Wang, hitting him in the head. Wang fell to the ground. The man then turned and fled the room. Huang was terrified and screamed for help. By the time the hostel's tea attendants and clerks arrived to investigate, the assailant had long since disappeared. They immediately reported to the Lao Zha Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. Wang Jieren was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment but died upon arrival due to the severity of his injuries. Huang and the tea attendant on duty were taken to the police station for questioning, and Huang was temporarily detained for investigation. As for Wang's profession, it is said that he used to run a lime kiln in Huzhou and served as the manager of the Zhenxin Stone Powder Company. He was a native of Chuansha, Pudong, and was only 31 years old. Recently, he had colluded with a certain party and served as the "Director of Shipping Management Office" of the puppet "Transportation Bureau" in this city. Therefore, the reason for his assassination is still subject to various rumors.</p>
<h3>The Truth About Chen Tingsheng's Murder: An Adulterer Killed His Lover Out of Jealousy</h3>
<p>Several Suspects Have Been Arrested, Tao Boqing is Highly Suspected</p>
<p>Chen Tingsheng, also known as Chen Sanzi, a famous gangster in the former Ma Li Shi area and currently a foreman at the Huaxing Paperboard Factory on Gordon Road, was suddenly assassinated at approximately 7:00 AM on the 20th. Four thugs, one guarding the back door and the other three rushing upstairs into Chen's room, killed him. The assailants fled the scene. Later, the French police were notified and took the body to the Tongren Funeral Home for examination. They also brought the deceased's mistress, Wang Guizhen, and concubine, Cao Ali, to the police station for questioning and to investigate the assailants. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that, based on the testimony of the deceased's concubine, Cao Ali, the police dispatched detectives to the Letian Teahouse in Xujiahui Town at 10:00 PM that night and arrested Tao Boqing, a key suspect, for questioning. It is said that Tao is the lover of Chen's mistress, Wang Guizhen, and the assailants are Tao's disciples. Chen's murder was indeed due to an affair. Yesterday, the police reported to Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special Court, who, accompanied by a forensic doctor, arrived at the funeral home to examine the body. After examining the body, they began the inquiry. The investigating officers reported the results of the investigation after the incident. Then, Chen Tingfu, the deceased's brother, filed a case, requesting redress and claiming the body for burial. When questioned, the concubine Cao Ali stated that Wang had an affair with Tao Boqing and that she recognized Tao's disciples among the assailants. When questioned, Wang initially denied it but then remained silent. Prosecutor Wang then ruled that Chen Tingsheng had indeed died from gunshot wounds, and the body was handed over to Chen Tingfu for burial. The assailants were apprehended by the police and handed over to the court for handling. After the examination, Wang was taken back to the police station for further questioning. It is reported that after the incident, the police found the murder weapon in a trash can in Haige Lane on Haig Road and a shell casing in the room. Detectives have been dispatched to search for the fleeing assailants. Wang and Tao Boqing will be transferred to the Second Special Court for interrogation today after the investigation is completed. It is also rumored that the deceased was a Shanghai soil baron, a disciple of Xiao Hubei, Fan Mouzhicheng said.</p>
<p>(Further News) It was found that the mastermind behind the crime, Tao Baiqing (33 years old), a local, lived in a bungalow in the Triangle area of Xujiahui. He was a local bully who had defrauded Fan Gencai of the Pudong Guerrilla Force out of 300 yuan last year and has not dared to cross to Pudong since. Recently, he became acquainted with Wang Guizhen and often visited her. However, the affair was discovered by Chen's concubine, Cao Ali, who revealed the secret history of Tao and Wang. Chen then investigated secretly without making a sound. Soon, Chen uncovered the affair, and Tao became enraged and quarreled with Chen. Chen returned home in anger and beat Wang Guizhen severely. Chen then discussed the matter with Wang Xinda, planning to break off the relationship with Wang Guizhen. However, Wang Xinda did not express any opinion at the time. Therefore, it was not until recently, when Chen heard unfavorable news, that he prepared to move elsewhere. Wang Guizhen immediately informed Tao Boqing, who quickly devised a plan to kill Chen. Therefore, when Chen was killed, Cao Ali witnessed two of Tao's disciples committing the crime. It is said that the French police arrested more than ten suspects, including Xing Ali, Gen Xiang (nickname Xiaobailian), Wang Liansheng, and Shan Qiuyu, at the Caishi Street Traffic Hotel at around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday and brought them to the police station for investigation.</p>
<p>It is said that Wang Guizhen was first married to a tailor surnamed Li, and later married a carpenter foreman, Mr. Jia. After divorcing, she became acquainted with Chen Tingsheng and has been with him for fourteen years. However, Wang has always been romantic and unrestrained, and has had many lovers. Tao Baiqing is her latest lover. It is found that Tao also has a wife and a concubine, who are also said to have been arrested. Tao's father, named Lai Li Tou Bo Qing, is also an unemployed rogue. The arrested suspects will be transferred to the court by the police today for handling.</p>
<p>Wang Xinda's Letter Further, according to a letter from Wang Xinda, the brother of the deceased's mistress, he says: Dear Editor, I read in yesterday's newspaper in the local news column that Chen Tingsheng (aka Chen Sanzi), a gangster in Ma Li Shi, was assassinated at his residence at No. 39 Haige Lane, and that Chen's wife, Wang Guizhen, is the younger sister of Wang Xinda, the former rumored puppet "Chairman of the Maintenance Association" of Fa Hua Town, etc. I was shocked to read this. I, Wang Xinda, have been peacefully operating a sauce business and have never offended anyone. However, without considering the facts, and based on rumors, last summer, I was labeled as the puppet "Chairman of the Maintenance Association" of Fa Hua Town and published in the newspaper, causing a commotion among the neighbors. I, Wang Xinda, asked myself and felt no guilt, and dared not lag behind others in loving the country. In addition to publishing a statement, I moved to No. 27 Haige Lane last winter to clarify my intentions by not involving myself in Fa Hua Town. As for my younger sister, Guizhen, she first married a Mr. Qian in the same town. After her husband died, she remarried Mr. Chen. I, Wang Xinda, broke off the sibling relationship with Guizhen because she did not uphold the virtues of a woman, and I have no contact with the Chen family. The details in your newspaper are completely inconsistent with the facts. I am deeply afraid that the rumors will be inaccurate and confuse the public. I am writing to request a correction. This is my sincere prayer. Respectfully yours, Wang Xinda, No. 27 Haige Lane, Haige Road. March 21st.</p>
<h3>Reason for Assassination of Shuttle Car to Hongkou</h3>
<p>Japanese Want Monopoly of Business</p>
<p>Special Use of This Terror Tactic</p>
<p>According to the French Shanghai Daily on the 21st, according to reliable sources, in the past two weeks, there have been repeated incidents of shuttle car drivers being killed on the north bank of the Suzhou River. It is now heard that the reason for these incidents is that the Japanese side has established several transportation companies in Hongkou, attempting to monopolize the transportation business north of the Suzhou River. However, residents in the concession prefer to hire cars from Yunfei and Dalu, two foreign companies, to go to Hongkou. Therefore, the Japanese side intends to use terror tactics to prevent the shuttle cars of various foreign companies from entering Hongkou for business again, in order to achieve their monopolistic ambitions. It is now heard that the shuttle car drivers of Yunfei and Dalu are already greatly alarmed and dare not accept the employment of customers in Hongkou. However, according to the police investigation, the rumors of the aforementioned Japanese terror tactics have not yet been confirmed. Until now, no criminals or clues related to this case have been found. However, in reality, since the crime occurred in Hongkou, the investigation of this case is very difficult.</p>
<h3>Manager of Yitaixing Coal Store Accused of Inciting False Accusation</h3>
<p>Falsely Accused Lin Jiabin of Being a Robbery Gang Member, Causing Lin Great Pain and Almost Disability</p>
<p>The Yitaixing Coal Store on Xinzha Road was robbed by multiple intruders on the night of January 15th of this year, who made off with tens of thousands of dollars in French currency. The New Zha Police Station was notified and ordered detectives to bring Hu Tingxiang and Meng Zhenjia, employees of the store, to various public places the next morning to identify the robbery gang. While passing the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hardoon Road, Hu and Meng told the detectives that a passenger on the No. 7 bus had a face very similar to the robber who had been watching them with a gun the night before. The detectives then stepped forward and arrested the man, bringing him back to the police station. According to the man, his name was Lin Jiabin, 29 years old, from Taizhou, and he lived at No. 6 Anle Lane, McGillivray Road, where he ran the Fuhua Coffin Factory. He was a legitimate businessman and not a thief. However, Hu and Meng, as well as five other employees of the store, insisted that Lin's face was indeed the same as the armed robber, causing Lin to be detained for eight days and suffer greatly, almost becoming disabled.</p>
<p>After the police confirmed that Lin was indeed not involved, he was released. After being released from prison, Lin believed that he had been wrongly imprisoned because of the false accusations of Hu and Meng, and that Shen Jinzhou, the manager of the Yitaixing Coal Store, should be held responsible for inciting the false accusation. Moreover, because of the wrongful accusation, he had suffered great physical pain and damage to his reputation. Therefore, he specially commissioned lawyer Xu Wufang to send a letter to Shen Jinzhou requesting that he publish an apology to restore his reputation. However, Shen refused to reply to the letter. Lin, left with no choice, hired lawyers Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, and Lu Qi to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court against Shen Jinzhou, Hu Tingxiang, and Meng Zhenjia for perjury and false accusation, requesting that they be punished according to Articles 168 and 169 of the criminal law. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened a criminal court to hear the case. Since the perjury part could not be filed as a private prosecution, only the false accusation part was proceeded with. According to the defendant's defense, Shen Jinzhou knew nothing about the identification, and Lin's face was indeed similar to one of the robbers, so there was a misunderstanding. However, the plaintiff's lawyer argued that a mistake in identification was still plausible, but the defendants still firmly insisted that Lin looked like one of the robbers when they identified him at the police station for the second time, causing the plaintiff to suffer greatly. The court, believing that the facts were clear, ordered the lawyers of both parties to debate and then announced the conclusion, setting a date for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Assaulting Mother-in-Law, Sentenced to Five Years</h3>
<p>Ye A'wu, who lived in Maggie Lane, Maggie Road, in the French Concession, had an argument with his wife, Cao, on March 4th over a trivial matter. His mother-in-law, Cao Xiao, stepped forward to mediate, but A'wu turned his anger on her, shattering her left eyeball and causing her to lose her sight. Cao Xiao sued Ye A'wu for injuring a close relative in the Second Special Court. After repeated court hearings by Judge Li Weishan, yesterday's sentencing was as follows: Ye A'wu was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for causing serious injury to another person.</p>
<h3>Loss of Wooden Boards at the Workplace, Reported to the Japanese Military Police</h3>
<p>Failure to Report to the Police Station Infringes on the Police Authority of the Concession, Foreman and Workers Alike Detained and Sent to Court</p>
<p>The Japanese-Chinese Cotton Mill is located near Robison Road, Rue Bourgeat, in western Shanghai. The contractor for the construction of the dormitory for the factory's employees is the Japanese Daixin Construction Company at No. 16, Lane 1345, Gordon Road. Ye Linji, a carpenter foreman from Jiangbei, subcontracts part of the construction project from Daixin. The foundation-filling project is contracted by Wang Jinji, also from Jiangbei, and subcontracted to Tongli Transportation Company at No. 613, McGillivray Road. Currently, earthworks are being carried out on a large scale, with masons, carpenters, and earth-moving workers all working separately. However, it was discovered the day before yesterday (19th) that more than 200 wooden boards were missing from Ye Linji's carpentry site, valued at 1,253 yuan in French currency. Because Tongli sent workers to the site every day to dig and move earth, it was suspected that the missing timber was stolen by these earthworkers. Ye did not report the case to the Gordon Road Police Station in charge of the area, but instead, on his own initiative, requested the head of Daixin Construction Company, two Japanese men named Nishitori Kiyoshi and Hamahigashi Fumio, to go to the Tongli Transportation Company and demand that the workers suspected of stealing the boards be handed over so that they could be taken to the Japanese military police detachment stationed at the Japanese-Chinese Cotton Mill for interrogation. Tongli initially refused to comply. Therefore, Nishitori Kiyoshi returned alone and then brought two uniformed Japanese military police officers and Wang Jinji, who originally contracted the project, to Tongli.</p>
<p>Without listening to their explanations, they took four Tongli workers from Jiangbei, Wang A'er, Shao Lixiu, Shao Guanfa, Wang Er, and Dai Zi, away. The incident was learned by the Gordon Road Police Station in charge of the area. After the Chinese and foreign detectives thoroughly investigated the matter with all parties involved, they determined that since the theft and the location of the arrest were both within the Public Concession, no third party was allowed to take such unilateral action, infringing on the police authority of the Concession. After the police authorities reasoned with the other party, they brought the arrested Wang A'er and the other three back to the Gordon Road Police Station for temporary detention. Ye Linji and Wang Jinji were also detained for improperly accusing them and were sent to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Judge Meng Tingke opened a court to hear the case. The police representative, lawyer Qian Xunjiu, stated that the police suspected that Wang A'er and the other four had stolen the wooden boards and requested permission to detain them for further investigation before making a decision. For Ye Linji and Wang Jinji's actions of assisting in the detention of the workers, a detailed investigation was also needed. Since they claimed to have been stolen from, they should not have failed to report to the police station. Therefore, they requested permission to detain them for investigation to ascertain the truth. It was also testified by witness Zhao Feng that the wooden boards were transported away by truck No. 17132. In court, Ye Linji testified that he contracted the project and that wooden boards were indeed stolen from the site. Wang Jinji testified that the arrest of the workers at that time was due to a misunderstanding of each other's language. The other four, Wang A'er and the others, all denied stealing the timber. Judge Meng, after examining the testimony, ordered Ye Linji and the other six to be detained for a retrial on Saturday.</p>
<h3>Already Dismissed Male and Female Servants Attempted to Kidnap Young Master, Foiled</h3>
<p>Surnamed Sheng Student from Western District Elementary School Almost Kidnapped</p>
<p>Male Servant Escaped, Female Servant and Driver Detained at Police Station</p>
<p>A foiled kidnapping case occurred near the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Great West Road at around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. The details are as follows: The victim was a nine-year-old Sheng student from the Western District Elementary School of the Public Works Department, whose family lived in Jing'an Temple Alley. The student usually had a private car to pick him up from school. At around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, just as the Western District Elementary School was about to dismiss classes, two people dressed as a male and female servant drove a shuttle car to the school gate and spoke to the doorman, claiming to have been ordered to pick up the Sheng student to return home. After school was dismissed, the elementary school student left the school and saw that the people who came to pick him up were not the current family members, but rather the male and female servants who had been dismissed a long time ago. Moreover, the car was also different. Therefore, the student refused to get in the car and turned back into the school. Upon seeing this, the male and female servants immediately stepped forward to pull him. In a moment of desperation, the student cried out. Fortunately, the school's watchman was alert and immediately ran out to see what was happening. After learning the details, he quickly detained the male and female servants along with the driver and reported to the principal, who in turn reported to the police station. Unexpectedly, due to a slight oversight, the male escaped. Therefore, by the time the detectives arrived, only the female suspect and the driver were taken to the police station for questioning. The Sheng student was then notified by the principal to his family members, who, under the protection of two bodyguards and six servants, rode in two cars and returned home safely. As for the escaped male suspect, the police are currently conducting a strict search.</p>
<h3>Lao Yuchang Earth Company Used Children to Transport Soil</h3>
<p>Caught on Public Bus</p>
<p>Continued to Obtain Four More Suspects at Distribution Point</p>
<p>Lao Yuchang Earth Company, located at the end of Connaught Road, Xinkang Lane, a road built across the border in western Shanghai, is jointly opened by several shareholders, including Zheng Chongye, Yao Qisheng, and Chen Xizhang from Chaozhou. It is usually very prosperous in business and has established a distribution point for selling opium soil at No. 641 Hankou Road in the Public Concession, sending people to sell it everywhere. To transport opium soil, they use children under the age of 16 to smuggle it into the Concession from outside the border. Zheng Chongda, the younger brother of Zheng Chongye, and Lin Qiaosheng from Guangdong, both 14 years old, are usually responsible for transporting opium soil. At 10:10 AM the day before yesterday, Lin Qiaosheng was carrying four pounds, three ounces, and one-quarter of an ounce of opium soil from Lao Yuchang Earth Company and riding on the No. 2 public bus when it passed the intersection of Foch Road and Chengdu Road. He was suddenly encountered by Western Sergeant No. 278 and a Chinese police officer who boarded the bus to search. They arrested Lin Qiaosheng and seized the aforementioned opium soil, taking him to the Chengdu Road Police Station. After investigating, Chinese Detective Ma Wenda and Lang Chengpei learned that there was a sales agency located at No. 641 Hankou Road. They went to the agency and arrested four Cantonese, Xiao Jingcheng, Zheng Chongda, Yao Xinli, the younger brother of Yao Qisheng, and Wang Zhou. They then went to No. 344 Guangxi Road to arrest Yao Qisheng, but he was not found. They were all taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case and requested a postponement. After Judge Chuan Lin questioned each defendant, he ordered them to be detained and postponed the retrial to the 28th.</p>

Recently, the Export-Import Bank of Washington, D.C., in the United States, has also allowed Poland a credit loan of six million US dollars, designated for the purchase of US cotton and copper. Two million US dollars of this amount can be used this year.

<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>To the Editor: According to Mrs. Lou Wu, wife of the late Lou Ziyun, she was astonished to read a news report about the seizure of opium at Julai Da Road, which stated that the car at No. 245 belonged to the late Lou Ziyun, former detective captain of the Shanghai Police Department, who resided at No. 11, Xichengli, Ximen Road. After Lou's death, his wife instructed the driver to take the car out to pick up business on the streets. Upon investigation, the car at No. 245 was purchased by her late husband during his lifetime. Recently, she has been bedridden and rarely goes out. She is unaware of how the driver could have taken the car out to pick up business without her knowledge. This matter has been investigated and confirmed by the police. The driver, Zhai Linqing, also testified that it did not involve her. Although she is a woman, she would never engage in illegal business. The report in your newspaper is inaccurate and concerns her reputation. She has commissioned a representative to send letters to various newspapers for correction to ensure public understanding. Therefore, we request that you publish this letter to correct the record.

After the war, local bullies led by Jin Zhengde organized the 'Sijiao Sand and Gravel Maintenance Association' and forcibly seized it, limiting 60 sailing vessels for transportation. The Shanghai side organized the Wan Tai Company to supply one-third of the sand and gravel loaded to the Japanese side, monopolizing the market using special forces, raising prices, and cutting off the livelihoods of porters and fellow traders. Therefore, the industry has been arguing based on reason," I have never issued the above statement because it is inconsistent with the facts.

<h3>Finance: Gold Shops and Northern Banks Resume Purchasing, Cash Prices Rise Instead of Fall</h3>
<p>Minimal Fluctuations on the Day, Transactions Over 700 Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cash "Xiachi" (raw gold) unofficial market suddenly stopped falling and turned upward. It opened at over 2,060 yuan. Securities firms absorbed purchases earlier, followed by gold shops and a certain jewelry store. As a result, the market price once reached 2,069 yuan. Later, due to the sell-off of foreign exchange and Hong Kong telegraphic transfers, the underlying trend was slightly firm, which led to a sell-off by general retail bulls. This caused the price to fall back slightly. In the end, the price rose by seven yuan, but there were many fluctuations in the middle. However, there were no major disturbances, and the overall sentiment was stable. Transactions were average, around 700 taels. Jewelry gold also rose by one yuan. Customs gold remained stable, while British pure gold, etc., fell slightly.</p>
<p>"Xiachi" Unofficial Market Rises by Seven Yuan</p>
<p>Starting in the morning, each bar of ten taels initially rose by several yuan due to the strong buying interest from securities firms. Securities firms first bought 50 taels at 2,064 yuan, the opening price, which was six yuan higher than the previous day. Afterwards, gold shops bought 50 taels at 66 yuan, followed by jewelry stores buying 50 taels at 64 yuan. Then, money changers bought 20 taels from jewelry stores and another money changer bought 10 taels from gold shops, both at 64.5 yuan. Subsequently, Yuhao and a certain jewelry store competed to buy, causing the price to continue to rise. Gold shops bought 100 taels from jewelry stores at 65 yuan. Money changers did 50 taels among themselves at 67 yuan. Later, a certain jewelry store bought 100 taels from gold shops, all at 69 yuan. At that time, the securities firms suddenly wanted to close out their positions at a high price, but buyers had stopped buying and were watching from the sidelines, so the price fell back slightly. Securities firms sold 50 taels to money changers at 66 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning. It was heard that the price rose to 68-69 yuan after the close, but no transactions were seen. In the afternoon, money changers first bought 50 taels from jewelry stores at 68 yuan, followed by money changers doing 50 taels among themselves at 69 yuan. At that time, it was suddenly heard that foreign exchange was slightly firm, so retail investors again entrusted money changers to sell, causing the price to fall again. Gold shops did 50 taels among themselves at 67 yuan. Afterwards, gold shops bought 50 taels from money changers at 66 yuan. Finally, they bought another 50 taels from money changers at 2,065 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening. As a result, the price rose by seven yuan compared to the previous close, with only a five-yuan difference throughout the day. Cash gold shops sold at 2,075 yuan and bought back at 2,060 yuan. The current bid price is 50 yuan lower than the previous day's price.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Rises by One Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange rate for silver jewelry was initially unchanged, but at 11:00 AM, due to the extremely stable "Xiachi" underlying trend, it was increased by one yuan. Da Tong Hang, Lao Qingyun, and others revised their rates to 210 yuan, while new firms set their rates at 208 yuan and bought back at 202 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Shrinks by Half a Penny</p>
<p>London, 20th - British pure gold shrank by half a penny per ounce, falling to £7, 8 shillings, and 6 pence. As a result, the Central Bank's purchase price for Chinese cash also fell to 1,212.3 yuan. The listed customs gold remained flat at 2.396 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price also fell by 0.3 yuan to 1,207.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Most Foreign Currencies Slightly Decrease</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold fell by half a penny, and the exchange rates between the British and American currencies were unchanged. In this city, the foreign exchange market was initially stable, with little change in prices. However, the sudden sell-off of Hong Kong telegraphic transfers caused the banks to have difficulty absorbing them, and the US exchange rate was relatively stagnant. As a result, the market price loosened, but the US exchange rate became firmer. The "Xiachi" market immediately showed strength as the Tianjin banks actively started absorbing, followed by retail investors and gold shops. The market price rose slowly, which was encouraging and swept away the sluggishness of the past few days. However, the Tianjin banks and a certain gold shop took advantage of the high prices to sell, and the upward trend was once again frustrated. In the end, the price rose slightly, and the trend was sideways to firm. Due to the easing of exchange bills, most foreign currencies decreased slightly. Wealthy investors absorbed a large amount of British gold pounds and US dollar bills, and foreign banks also had strong demand. There were very few transactions among associations. Only Ying Feng issued US dollar bills for 400 yuan, which were purchased by Xiang Tai for 200 yuan and Bao Kang for 200 yuan. Yesterday's market prices were: British gold notes decreased by 5 cents, British dollar pounds decreased by 1 dime, US dollar notes decreased by 1 cent, French francs decreased by 1 li, Dutch guilders increased by 2 cents, Canadian notes decreased by 2 cents, Italian lire decreased by half a cent, and other currencies were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Slightly Softens</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for bank drafts and bills of exchange was slightly softer. The discount rate per thousand yuan fluctuated between 50 yuan and 50.05 yuan throughout the day, with the final price being 50.025 yuan, which was 0.29 yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Shanghai Exchange Rate Continues to Fall Slightly</h3>
<p>Tianjin, 21st - Compared with yesterday, exchange rates are as follows: British exchange increased by 0.09375, US exchange increased by 0.1875, and Shanghai exchange continued to fall by 1 yuan. The opening market prices for the morning are listed below:</p>
<p>British Exchange: 7 pence 8125</p>
<p>US Exchange: 15.25 yuan</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Continues to Sell US Exchange, The Trend is British Flat, American Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange market saw some buying from foreign firms, but the banks continued to supply abundantly, and there were continuous sell-offs from Hong Kong via telegraphic transfer, especially for US exchange. Therefore, the underlying trend was flat for British exchange and softer for American exchange. However, there were still few changes in the middle, and the volume of transactions was very low. Although there were some sell-offs of Hong Kong exchange by foreign firms and money changers, there were also many purchases by foreign firms and overseas Chinese, so the situation continued to soften.</p>
<p>Initially in the morning, London silver for near and distant dates rose by 0.0625, New York silver prices remained flat, London raw gold shrank by half a penny, and the exchange rates for British exchange versus US exchange were down by 7 mils, and unchanged against French and Shanghai exchange.

The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks opened at 8 pence 25 for British exchange and 16.09375 yuan for US exchange, unchanged for British exchange and up by 0.03125 for US exchange compared to the previous close.

The announcement of the balanced tax on silver was raised by 2 li, calculated at 5.25%. Afterwards, foreign electric telegrams from Hong Kong and HSBC continued to sell US exchange to Hua Bi and a certain bank at 16.09375 yuan. The situation remained flat. Near noon, transactions became even quieter, while the activity of Hong Kong exchange in and out was quite lively. Foreign firms settled purchases with foreign firms, Anda, Hong Kong exchange at 55.125 yuan. Subsequently, overseas Chinese absorbed Hong Kong exchange from money changers at 55.25 yuan, so the situation was also flat.

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Rebound Slightly</h3>
<p>Far East Stocks Continue to Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday's securities unofficial market saw a slight rebound after falling for four consecutive days. Because Britain has united with six countries against Germany, the democratic front is very strong, the market price rebounded slightly after bearing fatigue. The prospects are expected to turn around because people's hearts have already changed. Yesterday, Lemao No. 5 had many short-covering trades after the opening, while No. 4 and Tiansheng tried hard to call for purchases. Tianzi and Songmao were both short-covering. The price rebounded by 5-6 jiao in half a day. The afternoon market suddenly cleared, and customer gatherings were extremely rare. Retail bulls slightly sold, and the market price was slightly tired. Types A and B were still quite strong. The sellers were Lemao and No. 5, while Dafeng and Lianhe were still absorbing. As a result, they were slightly better by 0.25 to 0.4 jiao. The total number of transactions was only over 400,000 yuan. The following is a brief table:</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 50 shares of the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange were traded at a price of 28 yuan, which was more than 0.7 jiao higher than before.</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Currency Bonds (20th of this month) (Monday) Listed market prices are trending lower. The Hukuang Railway Bond with German Debenture Bonds fell sharply by £3 to £18.

<p>Currency Issues</p>
<h3>The Setback of Undermining Legal Tender</h3>
<p>— Xiao Hui</p>
<p>About half a month ago, some Shanghai merchants who traded with the North were harboring suspicions that the "Japanese puppets" would prohibit the use of legal tender in North China from March 11th of this year. Especially commodities like raw oil, soybean oil, and raw kernels, mostly transported from Shandong, fueled speculative fervor, and the price of raw oil rose uncontrollably. However, those with a clear mind had already considered one question: Could the foundation of legal tender, deeply rooted among the people, be so easily destroyed? Anyone with common sense knew this was the "Japanese puppets'" wishful thinking. Moreover, using well-prepared legal tender to exchange for unprepared counterfeit currency and military scrip, no matter how foolish or clumsy, and even under oppressive and tyrannical rule, everyone could discern the relative advantages and disadvantages and would seek good fortune and avoid disaster. As expected, the Japanese puppets issued an exceptional statement, which was further confirmed by publications like the "Peiping Political News" (French version). It stated:</p>
<p>"The 'Provisional Government' here previously issued an 'order' to prohibit the use of legal tender within North China from March 11th, but this 'order' has obviously become invalid and has been withdrawn through disguised means. What is this method? It is stipulated that legal tender can still be used within 'bandit areas,' and the so-called 'bandit areas' are the guerrilla zones where Chinese military forces are located."</p>
<p>This passage proves that the Japanese are like silver-plated spearheads, all show and no substance. To help readers better understand this fact, it is worthwhile to make another statement:</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new currency policy in 1935, legal tender has been fundamentally built on the basis of national credit, unlike before when it relied solely on bank credit. Therefore, legal tender is deeply rooted and backed by strong government credit. How could the "Japanese puppets'" conspiracy succeed? Although they are forced to temporarily use legal tender in the areas controlled by the Japanese puppets, the people are not willing to accept it. Now, let's explain the reasons that favor legal tender's resistance:</p>
<p>(1) Although North China is superficially an occupied area, the Japanese army only occupies a handful of cities. Most of the land is still in the hands of our guerrilla forces. In the guerrilla zones, everything is done in accordance with the central government's regulations for cracking down on Japanese puppet banknotes. The use of counterfeit currency is punishable by death. Therefore, purchasing goods in these areas uses legal tender, and the legal tender system is still established in the vast guerrilla zones.</p>
<p>(2) Counterfeit currency itself has no preparation and cannot purchase foreign exchange. When the Japanese established the puppet bank, they originally planned to use 60 million yuan of silver left in North China as a reserve for purchasing foreign exchange. However, this silver was all stored in banks in the Tianjin concessions and could not be looted.</p>
<p>(3) The Tianjin concessions and the Peiping embassy district welcome legal tender.</p>
<p>(4) Foreign banks refuse to sell foreign exchange with counterfeit currency.</p>
<p>Based on the above points, it proves that legal tender is built on rational economic principles, the willingness of Chinese and foreign people to use it, and the fortress of international credit. Its position is strong and consolidated, and it cannot be easily destroyed by the "Japanese puppets."</p>
<p>Therefore, in North China, legal tender has not only not been driven out by counterfeit currency, but has also increased in proportion. The following is the amount of legal tender circulating in North China before the puppet bank was established and the "counterfeit currency" was issued, and now, nearly a year after the "counterfeit currency" was issued and claimed to be discontinued, according to the Central Bank (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>As of March 5, 1938:</p>
<p>Central Bank 35,874,655</p>
<p>Bank of China 148,902,500</p>
<p>Bank of Communications 70,210,000</p>
<p>Four Banks 1,500,000</p>
<p>China Industrial Bank 1,750,000</p>
<p>China Agricultural and Industrial Bank 1,500,000</p>
<p>Kenting Bank 90,000</p>
<p>Zhejiang Industrial Bank 20,000</p>
<p>Dazhong Bank 560,000</p>
<p>Hebei Provincial Bank 50,000,000</p>
<p>Frontier Bank 50,000</p>
<p>Beiyang Baoshang Bank 3,000,000</p>
<p>Total 313,457,155</p>
<p>As of January 28, 1939:</p>
<p>Central Bank 36,491,705</p>
<p>Bank of China 162,233,100</p>
<p>Bank of Communications 78,500,000</p>
<p>Four Banks 1,500,000</p>
<p>China Industrial Bank 1,750,000</p>
<p>China Agricultural and Industrial Bank 1,500,000</p>
<p>Kenting Bank 90,000</p>
<p>Zhejiang Industrial Bank 20,000</p>
<p>Dazhong Bank 560,000</p>
<p>Hebei Provincial Bank 50,000,000</p>
<p>Total 332,140,805</p>
<p>Comparing the above figures, it can be seen that the amount of legal tender in North China increased by 18,683,650 yuan in the past ten months under the pressure of counterfeit currency. Among them, the 3,050,000 yuan of banknotes from the Beiyang Baoshang Bank and the Frontier Bank were seized by the puppet bank due to the reorganization of the two banks by the puppet bank, so the second figure is 3,050,000 yuan less. In fact, the legal tender of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank increased by 21,733,650 yuan in the past ten months, which shows that it was not reduced by the pressure of "counterfeit currency."</p>
<p>"Counterfeit currency" is a disguised form of Japanese currency. The preparation of Japanese currency itself has been severely damaged and will soon be worthless. Japan's gold reserves are only 200 million yuan, and the original limit of Japanese banknotes was 120 million Japanese yen. Since the invasion of China, it has increased to 1 billion Japanese yen, and recently it has reached 2.2 billion Japanese yen. The Japanese warlords are still demanding an additional issuance of 500 million Japanese yen, making it 2.7 billion Japanese yen. This situation, as well as the skyrocketing prices in Japan, will not only leave them with no financial solutions, but also make the lives of the Japanese people unbearably painful.</p>
<p>Therefore, their plunder in the occupied areas of China will inevitably intensify. However, their promotion of "counterfeit currency" in Central and South China will not only be more abhorred by European and American powers, but also make the Japanese people feel unhappy. The result will inevitably lead to barter trade, with no cash income, hindering their foreign trade. Therefore, the Japanese military's invasion of China will later involve:</p>
<p>(1) Using force to seize all profitable industries in the Chinese war zone;</p>
<p>(2) Using force to control the products of various parts of China;</p>
<p>(3) Using exorbitant taxes and levies to plunder Chinese assets;</p>
<p>(4) Excavating and looting the stored wealth of the Chinese people;</p>
<p>(5) Issuing "military scrip" in exchange for Chinese goods and legal tender.</p>
<p>Recently, the trading of Japanese currency in the Shanghai market has been unusually active. It is currently impossible to discuss the reasons for this phenomenon. It is also impossible to discuss the future of Chinese legal tender and how to deal with the "Japanese puppets'" destruction of legal tender in this extraordinary period. Because if the discussion is too specific or the methods are discussed, publishing it in the newspaper for others to see is tantamount to creating a "Zhang Song's silent map," inadvertently preparing strategies for them to resist and destroy. If what is said and discussed is not "praising achievements and virtues" or "lofty lectures," then what is the value of such essays, dazzling the eyes and ears, increasing arrogance, and only being enough to ruin things? Moreover, talking about things blindly (not looking for lice) and being able to "speak only when necessary, and hit the mark with every word," is it not "exceedingly difficult"? However, if you have real knowledge and insight, why not offer it to those responsible, which is still a good way.</p>
<p>However, here are a few superficial words to observe the future of legal tender:</p>
<p>(1) Legal tender credit has penetrated deeply into the people;</p>
<p>(2) It has gained the trust and support of friendly nations;</p>
<p>(3) It leaves no opportunity for "Japanese puppet" currency to stay;</p>
<p>(4) It allows for the solid political organization of the guerrilla zones;</p>
<p>However, how to control the black market exchange in Shanghai, how to prevent foreign exchange from being used by others while still not hindering trade with Europe and the United States? However, those who are determined to destroy legal tender have not given up, and there will be many changes in the future; words cannot achieve the desired effect!</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Domestic Cotton Supply Almost Exhausted; Mills Turn to Foreign Cotton</h3>
<p>Due to the easing of the European political situation and some congressmen in Washington expressing opposition to the dumping of American cotton overseas and demanding that the government order the sale of American cotton overseas to be at the same market price as in the United States, without intentional price drops, the cotton market reacted slightly, rising by more than ten pounds. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by more than three rupees, and Egyptian cotton also rose by more than twenty pounds. Yesterday, the exchange rate did not fluctuate much. When converted into legal tender, cotton prices all rose. American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 1.25 yuan per dan, Indian cotton rose by 1.2 yuan, and Egyptian cotton rose by 3 yuan.</p>
<p>The transaction of foreign cotton in the Shanghai market has been good for several days, and the sale of yarn has improved. Mills have also made large orders. Yesterday, Shenxin made an order for more than 2,000 pieces of 20-count "Flying Woman" and "Double Horse" yarn, intending to replenish their cotton stock. However, Indian cotton is the most cost-effective for 20-count raw cotton. However, the cost of shipping Indian cotton is high. The amount of Indian cotton shipped to China this year is particularly large. The Indian docks are crowded with Indian cotton waiting to be shipped to Shanghai. Although Indian cotton ships occasionally arrive in Shanghai, the number of shipments is still small. Currently, the supply of domestic cotton is almost exhausted. Buying American cotton is still slightly more expensive. Buying Indian cotton cannot arrive on schedule. Each factory deeply feels the difficulty of buying cotton. Yesterday, only Xinyu had 200 bales of Brazilian cotton spot goods. The remaining factories had no transactions. The cotton prices of yesterday are listed below:</p>
<p>The domestic cotton business is still sluggish, but the selling price is as stable as ever. This is because the yarn market is tired and depressed, the factories are unhealthy, and the foreign cotton exchange price is still cheaper than domestic cotton. However, each factory has not yet pulled in a large amount. Yesterday, Shenxin entered 500 pieces. According to some news, Chinese and foreign factories are negotiating, but nearly 10,000 pieces have already arrived at the factory. Japanese factories have sufficient demand and there is no urgent need to buy cotton, so they have no intention of trying domestic cotton. However, the bottom goods are particularly scarce. Although the source from Subei has not been cut off, the amount is minimal. It is said that six boats of fire-powered cotton from Pudong were blocked from being transported to Shanghai and are currently under negotiation. There is no certainty whether we can release them for transport. Under this environment, the cotton price is quite difficult to loosen. 389 bales of Tongzhou fine velvet cotton arrived at the pier. The situation of the current cotton is recorded on the left.</p>
<h3>Customers Complain of High Prices; 32-Count Single Yarn Falls Back 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>Shenxin Opens 2,700 Bales of 20-Count Yarn</p>
<p>The yarn market turned weak because the price of 32-count single yarn, which had been soaring wildly for several days, was deemed too expensive and unreasonably high by customers, so they stopped buying. In addition, the Japanese warships in eastern Zhejiang were constantly harassing, and the exchange rate between Ningbo and Shanghai was tight, secretly raising the price of goods. As a result, people's hearts were hit hard. Although they wanted to do business in many ways, they saw that the facts did not allow it. Some of the floating inventory was spit out, and the market price suddenly fell by 10 to 3 yuan. The price of 32-count "Flying Woman" yarn was 560 yuan. However, when the actual situation is checked, it is still at a peak. As for the 20-count yarn market, the momentum is mediocre because of the increase in inventory and the lack of consumption. As soon as the single yarn price softened, the falling wind started again. In addition, the factory came to open up again. As soon as the籌碼鬆, the goods in hand were sold at the market price. The afternoon was still dull and weak, and the market was tired.</p>
<p>The current yarn situation: At the beginning, the quoted price for 32-count single yarn was 580 yuan, but customers did not buy it due to the gradual increase. As a result, the reaction suddenly rose, customers stopped buying, and the factory quickly changed spinning. As soon as the momentum leveled off, it fell by 10 yuan. The opening price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn did not move and was still 396.5 yuan. Subsequently, the opening of the factory caused people's hearts to relax, and at the same time, the actual demand was not strong, so it weakened step by step. The final price was 393.7 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 392 yuan. The market in the afternoon was still leisurely. Due to the rain, customers were scarce. As a result, it was found that each help bought a total of 1,440 bales throughout the day. The market price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn fell by 3.25 yuan compared with the previous day, "Flying Woman" yarn fell by 2 yuan, and the price of single yarn fell by 10 yuan. Only 10-count and 16-count yarn were still as firm as ever. Shenxin Factory opened 1,700 bales of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn and 1,000 bales of 20-count "Flying Woman" yarn. The price was 395 yuan each, and the fixed payment was 40 yuan. Yesterday, 500 pieces of cotton yarn were delivered from Tianjin. The amount of transactions for each help is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market is unusually bleak. Each help's needs are very clear, so people's hearts are calm. Only the recent brisk trade in cloth in the north has enabled the Japanese yarn price to rise one step. The current price of 20-count "Water Moon" yarn is 339 yuan, and the current price of 20-count "Blue Phoenix" yarn is 328 yuan, which is 1 yuan weaker than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Bean Demand is Weak</h3>
<p>Recently, the demand for yellow beans has been quite cold. Sha Huang and Du beans are out of season in terms of the season, but their potential is still on the rise, and the supply will eventually be exhausted. The inventory is drying up (except for Dalian beans), so the price is solid. Yesterday, Chongming Sha Huang made an opening of 50 bales, and the price was 8.5 yuan, a small amount. 50 bales of Pudong Du beans were traded, and the price was 10.3 yuan. More than 100 bags of medium-sized beans were successfully made, and the price was 9.1 yuan. Two cars of Dalian beans were made, and the price was 8.25 to 8.3 yuan, down 0.15 yuan. The April price was also a small 0.15 yuan lower, with four cars successfully opened, and the price was 8.22 to 8.25 yuan. At the moment, the trend of Dalian beans is entirely controlled by Dalian City.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Sentiment is Slightly Weak; Peanut Oil Rises Back 0.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the peanut oil market rose back 0.5 yuan after the sharp decline the day before. This is because the long-awaited arrival is still slim, so囤戶 are reluctant to sell their goods cheaply. As a result, only 30 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded, and the price was 29.5 yuan. Soybean oil has become the world of Dalian oil. Yesterday, the Dalian market was closed. The sentiment in this port was weak because the Dalian closing market report fell the day before. In the morning, the potential was weak. No matter the spot, the price fell 0.3 yuan. The transaction increased in the afternoon, and the market atmosphere turned tight. As a result, the market was slightly lower than the previous day, ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The market was opened as a whole. 100 barrels of Dalian oil were traded, and the price was 32 to 32.1 yuan. More than 300 barrels were made in March, and the price was 31.6 to 31.9 yuan. More than 1,000 barrels were made in April, and the price was 31.6 to 31.8 yuan. More than 100 barrels were made in May, and the price was 31.55 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Sea Worms have Expanding Sales Channels</h3>
<p>The previous market for sea worms was quite挺, and those who wanted to buy them were hesitant to move forward, so the sales channels were reduced. However, recently, the price has gradually returned to low, and Jian and Shantou helps have also begun to mobilize one after another. At present, the market price of Ningbo outer mountain worms is 30 to 31 yuan, and Shandong worms are 48 yuan. It is found that the stock of Zhoushan worms here is lacking, and there are only 70 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Market is Affected by the European Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Yokohama silk market was closed, and New York continued to be weak. Only Lyon was slightly better, and the silk price went up. New York 83.75 daily silk and 7/8 Shanghai each fell 0.08 yuan. The Guangdong silk market was not open, and both the near and far terms on the exchange fell 0.03 yuan. Therefore, the Shanghai market price in New York, when calculated, has entered the 1,700 yuan mark, at around 1,650 yuan. The Lyon silk market was slightly better, up 0.5 to 1 French francs. However, due to the unrest in the European situation and people's panic, there were no transactions.</p>
<p>The internal and external silk exchanges in this port were both deserted. Both buyers and sellers were watching the changes in the European situation. An Indian foreign firm entered 5担 of rough local silk, and the price was also weak. In short, the silk market has been strong and stagnant these days.</p>
<p>Another batch of Italian artificial silk has arrived, totaling 1,851 boxes, loaded by the Italian ship Victoria, and arrived in Shanghai on the 20th of the previous day, docking at the Hongkou Shuntai Wharf for unloading.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Factory Cloth is About to Undergo Re-examination; Min Help is Rushing to Load</h3>
<p>The demand for domestic cloth plain and dyed piece goods from the Chuan and Yue helps continues to expand. It is heard that the Wenzhou help in eastern Zhejiang received a telegram from the local area stating that it was bombed by Japanese aircraft, and the mouth of Zhenhai was also bombarded, causing unrest among the people. They hesitated to buy goods, and the sales of each goods remained in a balanced state. Only Yong'an Dapeng fine cloth factory索价 13.5 yuan for April futures, and spot goods are also trending tight. Small amounts are sold for 13.35 yuan, an increase of 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day. The Yue help purchased more than 100 boxes of colored twill, 120 packages of fine cloth such as Dapeng Fugui brand, and 100 packages of fine twill such as Fugui Ai brand. The Chuan help purchased more than 3,000匹 of light and dark blue cloth, all transported to Vietnam via Yunnan and Guizhou. The Min help is currently allowed to load goods in two batches for registration purposes, in order to meet market needs. After this, transportation must be stopped and implemented after strict review. The second batch was rushed yesterday, so the help was busy purchasing each goods.</p>
<p>Yesterday, East cloth was due to the lack of customer sales, the local demand was also weak, and those who were short were selling it by opportunity. Fine cloth and fine twill, such as Longtou and Feiyu brands, suddenly dropped by 0.05 to 0.075 yuan per piece. The momentum of sales of lower-grade trumpet fine cloth and寶貝细斜 has been strong, and more than 600 packages have been transacted. Trumpet is sold for 12.05 yuan per piece, and寶貝 is 11.5 yuan. It is heard that Dongmian Foreign Firm 收进 one or two hundred pieces of fine cloth, and people's hearts have recovered, so the sales results of each middle and lower-grade brand are similar to the previous day. Printed goods, such as哔叽色丁花布, are still very easy.</p>
<p>75 boxes of wool fabrics were shipped from Italy on the 20th.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Cashes in on Low Prices and Buys Again; Foreign Yuan Rice Arrived Yesterday; Japonica Rice Sales are Still Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, some of the ke xian 回出, and the market price immediately fell by 0.04 or 0.05 yuan, even close to one 角. However, after a small moment, the new 回 and local零 化 took the opportunity to buy, and the market turned stronger again. The number of transactions increased to more than 3,000 packages. Wu xian opened at 12.9 yuan, and Nanjing's high喊 of 13.2 or 13.3 yuan was not settled. Only 中决成议.</p>
<p>Foreign yuan rice arrived yesterday, and more than 100 packages of rice were sold with the market, and the price was 16.8 yuan, calculated at 160市斤, for consumption of tea snacks and milling powder. Foreign yuan rice has not been sold, and more than 200包 of foreign rice from Saigon opened, and the price is still 17.1 or 17.2 yuan.</p>
<p>The source of杜米 on the river only arrived at number 3, and more than 1,000 packages of car-transported baozi. The囤戶 and local sales markets are still sluggish, so the situation is quite soft. However, due to the rain, the sellers' thoughts are particularly firm. As a result, although the transactions of each goods are limited, the market is barely steady. The prices of thick and thin粳包子货 are not much up or down, only the goods from the river are slightly soft by a few cents to one 角. 杜洋埠尖 and 变元 are still守原盘.</p>
<h3>Grain: After the Factory盤 is Lowered, Flour Sales are Active</h3>
<p>The flour market gradually stabilized yesterday. It was found that after the factory盤 was lowered by 0.05 yuan the day before, the customer intake became active. Whole batches of transactions in Tianjin, Yantai, Weihai, and other places are expected to expand. The South Seas幫 went化也绞比前日为贪, and the foreign flour production price was slightly higher. The April futures are full, and the price of May Citibank flour is 2.58 to 2.6美金 per barrel, similar to the previous price. Due to the lack of船位, there are temporarily no transactions. Yesterday, a foreign firm telegraphed the Australian flour Lion brand, priced at 6金镑 per ton, and the price per package must be 4.3 or 4.4 yuan, but there is no reply yet. At a time when the European situation is弥漫 and the price of foreign wheat is soaring, people's hearts seem to be improving, so the factory盤 may be difficult to lower again. The unified market sold 二号粉 and 三四号粉 with 230,000 packages each. The price of 二号粉 is 4.65 yuan, 三号粉 is 4.5 yuan, and 四号粉 is 4.3 yuan. The market may be able to stabilize for a while.</p>
<p>The source of wheat is very rare. The goods on the Yangtze River一带 are almost extinct due to the high production price and the control of a certain party. Occasionally, there are sporadic arrivals near the沪宁路, and the执货者 think that奇货可居, and the shouted price is particularly high, so the factory stomach is not greedy for it. It is heard that the factory 收价 is 6.8 to 7 yuan, while the customer 售价 can reach 7.2 or 7.3 yuan. The formal market still has no 做的开云.</p>

<h3>The European Situation and China's Resistance War</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>I am a thoroughly optimistic person about China's War of Resistance. I believe that no matter how unfavorable the circumstances, as long as we remain united, unyielding, and fight to the end, the final victory will always be ours. So now that the European situation is suddenly rising and the map is changing color, I still hold this optimism.</p>
<p>However, I am not blindly confident. I have my reasons, especially the changes in the European situation, and even the outbreak of war, I think this is more beneficial than harmful to us.</p>
<p>Of course, our enemies will take advantage of the opportunity of the British and French nations being unable to look east to intensify their aggression, and even take advantage of the period when their accomplices, the fascist party members, are being威作福 in Europe, following behind to wave the flag and shouting, and making extra efforts to suppress us, showing their loyalty to their accomplices and to fascism. However, first, our war of resistance was originally using our own manpower and did not borrow a soldier from other countries; second, our material resources will never be exhausted because of the blessed environment; third, the military火, as well as all the needed objects, imported from Europe, were not very many, and even if they are cut off in the future, there are the United States and the Soviet Union as our backing. From these three points of view, to put it negatively, the changes in Europe, whether now or in the future, will not harm us.</p>
<p>What about the positive side? That is, is it beneficial to us? First, to promote the resolution of democracies to unite and crush the dreams of fascist countries, if they still have the strength, they will definitely give us extra help; second, the strength of democracies is ultimately far above that of fascist countries. Once a union is implemented, fascist countries will inevitably suffer setbacks. As a result, our enemies will inevitably become more isolated and weak in the international community; third, in the event of a world war caused by a European war, our resistance war will indeed become a part of the total resistance war of the democracies against the fascist countries. The day the democracies win is the day we win, just as the initial devastation of Belgium will eventually be restored, and the victory of the democracies is beyond doubt. Summarizing these three points, the changes in Europe, whether now or in the future, are only beneficial to us.</p>
<p>Therefore, I was originally optimistic about my country's war of resistance, and I am even more optimistic now.</p>
<p>However, I say again, my optimism is based on our unity and fighting to the end, so we should continue to work hard.</p>
<h3>Welcoming the Morning Sun</h3>
<p>— Starfire</p>
<p>——Life of a Newspaper Worker in the Guerrilla Zone</p>
<p>I jump out of bed in a hurry, before the alarm clock has even stopped ringing; I open my sleepy eyes and light a candle. I turn on the radio, and it starts to emit crackling sounds 'tss... tss... cha... cha...'; after a short while, 'Changsha Broadcasting Station...' is reported repeatedly, and this sound is mixed with 'baa... baa...', it turns out that the sleeping sheep have been awakened.</p>
<p>The solemn national anthem plays, followed by singing. We stand solemnly, lower our heads, and recall with deep sorrow the past scenes of thousands of people gathering in the square, singing the national anthem loudly, and saluting the national flag rising straight up the pole. Now, under the shadows of bayonets and bombs, we can still hear the songs coming from our far-away rear. This song can make us shed tears, and even more so, it can inspire us to rise up.</p>
<p>'Now, we begin the news report!...' Each of us grabs a pencil, and brings our ears as close to the speaker as possible. At this time, the clock strikes four, and the sky outside the shuttered window is still dotted with sparse morning stars.</p>
<p>The pen in my hand chases the sound waves leaping out of the speaker, and sheets of white paper are filled with uneven lines and circles, sent out from under our pens.</p>
<p>At this time, all our joy is controlled by the rising and falling sound waves: we are sometimes worried, and sometimes can't help but burst into laughter, even though we know that recording requires a calm mind.</p>
<p>The rooster crows, and the sound of chopping firewood 'gua... gua...' comes from the kitchen. An old man walks out as usual, coughs a few times, and says to us kindly: 'Gentlemen, you're up so early, even earlier than us!' 'Hmm,' we respond absentmindedly as we write. 'Sir, what's the "market situation" that you heard today?' he asks kindly, but he doesn't know that we really don't have time to answer.</p>
<p>'Po... po...' The old man picks up his long-stemmed pipe, filled with tobacco, and extends it towards our candle flame. With his puff, the candle flame lowers. Everything in front of us goes black, and a string of sound waves slips past, never to be caught again; but we won't complain about him, because he's saving a precious match!</p>
<p>The morning light chases away the darkness, washing away the stains on the sky; a round of morning sun is rising, and the dawn wind carries a faint coolness.</p>
<p>Time seems extraordinarily short in the course of work. When the sound waves emitted from the loudspeaker gradually decrease due to the sudden change in air pressure, the morning light penetrates from the skylight on the roof, and the hour hand on the clock face moves to the '6' mark.</p>
<p>Welcoming the morning sun, we walk into the wilderness, stepping on the green grass and wildflowers full of dew. We stretch our chests, inhale the morning air, clench our fists, and strike towards our front.</p>
<h3>The So-called "Peace"</h3>
<h3>On the "Pale Face" of "Scholars"</h3>
<p>— Yang Yanqi</p>
<p>Whenever "scholar" is mentioned, the idea of a "pale face" always comes to mind. Therefore, I hate the words "scholar"! It's not that I think a "pale face" insults humanity, but that I think a "pale face" is really shameful.</p>
<p>I have always looked down on "pretty boys", not only looking down on them, but also hating "pale faces" to the core. But unfortunately, I myself am in the circle of people who wield pens, which seems to have some connection with "scholars", so there is also a personal relationship, and I can't help but hate "pale faces" even more.</p>
<p>Scholars are the most useless kind of people, which has already been recognized by some people who like to draw conclusions. As for me, I still have a slightly stubborn bad temper, and I am unwilling to bow my head and accept punishment, and I still want to struggle out with a slogan or two. I feel that nothing in the world can be so easily judged, and that even "scholars" can be useful. Fortunately, thank God, someone has made a statement, proving that the pen has the same power as the gun. Only then did I smile through my tears and fall asleep.</p>
<p>But because of this, I hate "pale faces" even more.</p>
<p>Let's try to compare the pen and the gun. The person who wields the gun is not a "pale face", so why should the person who wields the pen be related to a "pale face"? If all the scholars in the world are pale faces, then articles will forever revolve around the circle of private appointments in the back garden. We have to use the pen instead of the gun, we also have to fight, and we also have to have the function of a fortress; we can't hide in the back garden and pace around.</p>
<p>The so-called "literati" doesn't seem to refer to "people who write articles", but to civilized people who have the strength to bind a chicken. Therefore, the concept passed down for thousands of years has made "people who write articles" unable to bind a chicken. As for the pen weighing a thousand pounds, it is just a descriptive sentence for literati to brag.</p>
<p>"Scholars" should quickly avoid "pale faces" and can no longer suffer this strange humiliation. To avenge the shame, to turn over, to seize the pen and raise it to the same height as the gun.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, the phrase "pale-faced scholar" is not unreasonable. Isn't it true that many people who wield pens are always hiding in their rooms, their faces never seeing the sunlight, and their skin never touching the outdoor air? They just lie on their desks, buried in piles of books, wielding pens, humming; where can there be any vitality? No wonder "pale faces" and "hunched backs" have become the characteristics of scholars. And the products of scholars are always inseparable from desks and piles of books. Occasionally there is a little fantasy, but it is just a daydream on the desk, in the pile of books.</p>
<p>We should "know ourselves", "does man not know himself"? Since we know ourselves, we should move forward on the path we want to take. Some people say "haste makes waste", yes, but if you want to achieve something, you have to walk, if you don't walk, how can you achieve anything? Everyone is guarding a narrow road, everyone is crowded into the same model; in fact, it is just a rat drilling into an ox's horn, a dead end. So, try to walk out of your house, leave your study, and run to the vast world to open your eyes!</p>
<p>The talisman of "pale-faced scholars": "art for art's sake", has already been considered unsound and contradictory; even more so now, we can no longer stick to this inexplicable sentence and use it as a defense for not opening our eyes.</p>
<p>Although I dare not hope to "advance rapidly" immediately, I at least hope that "scholars" and "pale faces" can break away from each other.</p>
<p>May Chinese literati all be strong, well-trained warriors!</p>
<h3>Chen Liang of the Southern Song Dynasty's Theory on Recovering Lost Territory</h3>
<p>— Jie</p>
<p>——Random Notes on Reading History——</p>
<p>Historical documents can be regarded as the most valuable legacy left by our predecessors to future generations. These documents are not merely antiques for future generations to admire and sigh over, but the crystallization of the experience of our predecessors, giving future generations extremely profound lessons. For example, the speeches made by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek after the War of Resistance Against Japan are not only of great significance at present, but also have indelible value in history even after hundreds or thousands of years. Here, I am going to introduce an important historical document, namely Chen Liang's "Proposal for Recovery" presented to Emperor Xiaozong of the Southern Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>Chen Liang was a native of Wuzhou in the early Southern Song Dynasty. He was born at a time when the Song Dynasty was suffering from the invasion of the Jin people. Most of the area north of the Yangtze River was lost to the enemy; the emperors of the Southern Song Dynasty also listened to the appeasement theories of several treacherous officials, only knowing how to maintain a temporary peace and following old customs, with no ambition to recover the lost territory. Therefore, during the reign of Emperor Xiaozong of the Song Dynasty, Chen Liang submitted memorials four times, requesting to govern with diligence and to rejuvenate the nation; and requesting to crusade against the Jin people in order to recover the lost territory. The article was tens of thousands of words long, and it was indeed a rare and remarkable piece of writing since ancient times!</p>
<p>The gist of the full text can be roughly divided into three layers. The first layer explains the advantages of resisting the war and the disadvantages of negotiating peace. Why should we resist the war? Because we want to save the suffering people in the occupied areas, to wash away the shame suffered by the country, to welcome back the coffins of Emperors Huizong and Qinzong, and to recover the lost territory. Chen Liang's original text is: "The innocent people are crying and have no one to turn to, so we cannot but save them; the humiliation of the country being invaded cannot but be washed away; the imperial tombs cannot but be returned; and the lost territory cannot but be recovered." Because of these four "cannot but" reasons, we must resist the war! Chen Liang also believed that if we don't recover the lost territory as soon as possible, then after a long time, I am afraid there will be no hope of recovery! He said: "It has been a long time since the southward crossing, and the elders in the Central Plains are dying one by one. Those who grow up in the enemy's land, how can they know that we exist?" This means that "the compatriots in the occupied areas still know how to miss their motherland; in the future, the younger generation will grow up, and I am afraid that they will be subjected to the enemy's enslavement education, and they will never think of their motherland again!" How reasonable is this statement! Just look at the present, aren't there many Taiwanese soldiers attacking their motherland? Chen Liang also gave a wonderful analogy, he said: "In vulgar terms, if parents and ancestors mortgage their property to others, and the children and grandchildren cannot redeem it, then after decades, when things change, they will all petition the government, claiming it as their former property. How can I say that I will mortgage it and then take it back? Then can today's matter (i.e., the recovery of lost territory) be further delayed?" This analogy is so accurate. Just look at Korea and Taiwan, which were originally our country's territory, but have been lost for decades. No country in the international community recognizes that this is Chinese territory anymore; Chinese geography textbooks no longer include Korea and Taiwan in the national territory. In this view, our Northeast Four Provinces should be recovered as soon as possible, and no further delay is allowed!</p>
<p>The second layer discusses the terrain for offense and defense. He believes that the southeast corner is not reliable, and we must fight for the land of Jingxiang. The third layer discusses the scholars who specialize in "theories of human nature", which are impractical and out of touch with the times. He said: "The scholars of today who think they have obtained the study of rectifying the heart and being sincere are all numb people who do not know pain! The whole world is content with the hatred of the ruler and father, and they bow their heads and talk about human nature and destiny, not knowing what is meant by human nature and destiny!" This scolding is so refreshing! Therefore, Zhu Xi at that time also believed that Chen Liang's remarks were "perverse talk." However, in all fairness, although Neo-Confucianism does not help the war of resistance, it is still a norm for personal cultivation. During the current War of Resistance, there are still people who take "pornographic articles" for money, and that is enough to scold them as "numb people who do not know pain."</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>"I don't think Mayor Chen is that kind of person. Perhaps there's a hidden reason for his taking the position of chairman of the 'Maintenance Society.' We shouldn't wrong him. Now, I want to go back and take a look at my lumber business over there, and I also want to sound him out to see if he's acting from his own heart."</p>
<p>Commander Ye felt that Dao's words were not bad, but he was very afraid that Cai Hefeng would be ignorant of the great cause and would not return after going, so he earnestly told him about the importance of the anti-enemy cooperation movement in the guerrilla area. Cai Hefeng said with a smile:</p>
<p>"I know this. Although I am a businessman, I also understand the great principles of the nation and the country, and I will never go against my conscience to cooperate with the enemy. And if Mayor Chen's acceptance of the chairmanship of the 'Maintenance Society' is not voluntary, I also want to discuss with him how to cooperate internally and externally to recover Hepu Town."</p>
<p>Commander Ye was very happy, and he repeatedly instructed Cai Hefeng to be careful not to fall into the enemy's trap, and to come back as soon as he had a chance.</p>
<p>As Cai Hefeng expected, Mayor Chen's taking the position of puppet "Maintenance Society" chairman was not voluntary, but was forced upon him. Originally, when the × army attacked Hepu Town, Mayor Chen also wanted to escape with his whole family, but his daughter, Xiuyue, was an admirer of Commander Ye, and insisted that Hepu Town would never be captured by the × army. Mayor Chen was an honest and kind person, without any ideas of his own, so he thought "it's better to stay put" and didn't run away. Unexpectedly, Hepu Town fell on the same day, and the streets were full of × troops. It was too late to escape, so he had to close his doors and stay at home, indicating that he would not be involved in external affairs from now on. But a person's name is like the shadow of a tree, and the × side had already taken a fancy to him as the person with the best reputation in the town, who was most suitable for their ideal puppet qualification, so even though he wanted to close his doors, the × side insisted on visiting him.</p>
<p>At first, Mayor Chen was also awe-inspiring in his integrity, and refused to agree to be the chairman of the "Maintenance Society", but the means of coercion by the × side's Pacification Squad Leader were very severe. He saw through that Mayor Chen was a useless honest person, so he used their consistent style, constantly threatening him that if he refused to agree, he would be accused of colluding with "bandits", not only would his property be confiscated, but his whole family would be slaughtered. Under such coercion, Mayor Dong had to violate his own heart and reluctantly agreed in order to protect the safety of his family.</p>
<p>Who knew that even though he had agreed to take up the puppet post of "Maintenance Society", he still could not guarantee the safety of his family. One-Eyed Li also took a fancy to his daughter, Xiuyue, and actually sent someone to propose marriage to him. How could Mayor Chen be willing to marry his flower-like daughter to a bandit, so he naturally refused outright. One-Eyed Li held a grudge in his heart, so he boasted to the × side's Pacification Squad Leader about how beautiful Xiuyue was. The × side's Pacification Squad Leader was originally a lustful person, so he personally came to Mayor Chen to propose marriage. Mayor Chen was secretly surprised, and had to use the words "unequal matches" to refuse, but the × side's Pacification Squad Leader had another set of new terms. He repeatedly said that this was "East Asia Co-prosperity," and the harbinger of "×-China integration," and finally unilaterally presented a betrothal gift and left, declaring that he would come to marry her in two days.</p>
<p>When this news reached Xiuyue's ears, she couldn't help but feel angry and bitter, and wept sadly all night. Although she had never met Commander Ye, her father often mentioned him in front of her, and her heart had long been set on Commander Ye. Later, when the marriage proposal failed, she was secretly disappointed in her heart, and when she heard that Commander Ye's reason for refusing the marriage was to hold the principle of "how can I make a home before the Xiongnu are destroyed," she not only did not resent his coldness, but increased her respect and love for him. She prayed day and night that the War of Resistance would end victoriously soon, so that she could fulfill her private wish of growing old together. Who knew that the great change would come unexpectedly, and seeing that she was in this environment where ghosts and monsters were rampant, there was no way to avoid the ravages of wolves and tigers. It would be better to end her own life as soon as possible, so that she could preserve her pure body. So, while everyone was sleeping soundly at night, she quietly tied a rope to the beam and hanged herself. (39)</p>

<h3>"Five Races United"</h3>
<p>— Mu Jie</p>
<p>The abandoned Five-Colored Flag has been brought out again, and along with it, a term "Five Races United" has been introduced. This is similar to "friendship" and "cooperation," good terms that sound very moving. It is said that the content is: There are five major races in "China." Everyone gets along harmoniously, unites together, and strives for East Asian peace, without being incited by others to go astray.</p>
<p>"Five Races United" is of course a good term; however, this content is said to be the case, and the truth is what people all over the world have witnessed. Threatening, enticing, provoking, and alienating, causing the five races to be discordant and engage in internal strife—this is truly the usual trick of invaders. Clearly causing the five races to be discordant, but insisting on saying that the five races are united, why? It is an attempt to cover up the eyes of the world with one hand. However, there are so many puppet "Manchukuo," puppet "Inner Mongolia Government," puppet "Provisional Government," and puppet "Renovation Government." If you want to say that they are not causing the five races to split, but are making the five races united, who would believe it?</p>
<p>On the contrary, the means of causing the five races to be discordant are enough to promote the five races to embark on a path of harmony and unity in the baptism of gunfire: Mongol princes once went south to request participation in the War of Resistance, and Hui leaders also expressed support for the government. Even the Miao people share the same hatred for the enemy and are willing to be the vanguard of the War of Resistance. Recently, there have also been Yi people from the border areas of Sichuan and Qinghai who have not visited the province for more than two hundred years, and they have specially elected representatives to visit the Sichuan provincial authorities and request participation in the War of Resistance. This is an ironclad fact: Tell the invaders that there is no longer such a thing as a division of five races in China. All Chinese people have united, are one family, and are working together to resist foreign aggression. Vicious means will never disrupt the feelings between the five races again. The five races are truly united. This is a valuable harvest in the furnace of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>In the original intention of the invaders, they wanted to realize their wild dreams through the beautiful name of "Five Races United"; unexpectedly, the five races actually became united. Not only united, but also became one family, without distinction, which is giving the invaders a powerful slap in the face!</p>
<h3>Safe Deposit Box</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>In Shanghai, where capitalism is most developed, the safe deposit boxes attached to banks seem to have become an extremely important necessity; in the wealthy class, their value is indeed higher than clothing, food, and housing. As long as a person has a little private property, they will inevitably rent a safe deposit box in the bank for storage. Therefore, almost all large and small banks in Shanghai have a department for this purpose, not to mention those with tall bank buildings.</p>
<p>Before "August 13th," renting a safe deposit box in a bank was not only simple, but also cheap, costing only a few yuan for a whole year. But what about now? In Shanghai, finding a safe deposit box is as difficult as finding a house, and it is difficult to rent one even with the help of others. The reason is very obvious, because after the war, the wealthy from all over the country, and even those with a small fortune, deposited their private property in those steel safe deposit boxes in Shanghai to avoid fleeing abroad; as a result, there are so many banks and so many safe deposit boxes in Shanghai, but they still cannot meet the demand. This kind of abnormal development is an indication that all private movable property (gold, silver coins, diamonds, valuable securities, etc.) in the guerrilla areas has been concentrated on the "isolated island." It can not only preserve one's own wealth, but also avoid aiding the enemy. To expand on this, safe deposit boxes in Shanghai also have some assistance in the War of Resistance and the national economy.</p>
<p>Because it has a strong steel and concrete building as the main defense, and a finely made box lock as the internal defense, it can be calm in the face of theft, fire, and other encounters; moreover, the renter of each box and the bank each hold a key, and it must be opened together to be used (the bank does not inquire about the contents inside). Therefore, it can avoid errors and protect the privacy of private property. With such an effect, it is naturally foolproof to store private property in it.</p>
<p>However, a large part of the safe deposit boxes in Shanghai are now being used by speculators and selfish people who lack understanding and faith in the currency system; what they store inside is mostly gold and silver "hard currency," which is not only useless to the country, but also has a considerable impact on the financial and currency system. Speculators buying and selling are not new, so let's not discuss them for now. However, the phenomenon of wealthy people hoarding gold bars, silver ingots, gold pound notes from the UK and the US, Hong Kong dollars, French francs, Singapore dollars, foreign exchange, foreign securities, etc., is always a phenomenon after the war, especially after Shanghai was given the nickname "isolated island" and the market lost control, resulting in the so-called black "market," and wealthy people stored these "hard currencies" under selfish considerations. Today, they buy a few gold bars and some foreign currency, secretly hide them in the safe deposit box, and tomorrow, they buy some more and hide them in the safe deposit box. Over time, they don't know how much "yellow and white stuff" is stored in those safe deposit boxes. Could it be that one of the reasons why gold prices are rising today is because of excessive hoarding?</p>
<p>These "hard currencies" and "foreign currencies" are things related to the economic lifeline of the nation during the War of Resistance. Stabilizing the currency system and foreign exchange requires their strength, but now they are being stored in safe deposit boxes, unable to come out and exert their effectiveness for the country. They have the idea of ​​protecting whole eggs under a toppled nest, which is of course not desirable, and the safe deposit box is precisely the tool that promotes this idea.</p>
<p>However, the fact that safe deposit boxes are being used for various purposes is not unique to Shanghai. Recently, I read in the newspaper that the safe deposit boxes of various Chinese and Western banks in Hong Kong have also been rented out, and HSBC Bank has even increased the number of safe deposit boxes by a thousand this year, and the rental fee has also been slightly increased, but it still cannot meet the demand. Although many wealthy people store treasures in this prosperity, I am afraid that many are being used abnormally by the general public, just like in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Time Service Report</h3>
<p>— Confused</p>
<p>She quickly reports the different seconds while warning you that life is passing away.</p>
<p>What is the question asked the most in our day, and the answer to that question must vary with the passage of time?</p>
<p>"What time is it now?" "How late is it?"</p>
<p>Using the telephone to ask for the time is also a novel and convenient thing in this era. Centuries ago, we had sundials—a Greek invention. Today, we have telephone clocks. With just the flick of a finger, Shanghai, like other major cities, has a time service. "95678" is its telephone number. It can tell you this troublesome question: "What time is it?" This time reporting service in Shanghai is more troublesome than in other cities because it must report in at least two languages—Chinese and English.</p>
<p>If we dial "95678," then we are connected to the time service room—it is located in a special broadcasting room at the Telephone Company at 460 Fujian Road. A Chinese girl sits in front of the broadcaster, staring intently at the clock. Every five seconds, she mechanically reports the exact time in Chinese and English.</p>
<p>Let's pay attention to her. She sits comfortably and comfortably in an armchair, although she must maintain a serious posture and a quick mind. She stares at the clock. Even if we go in, we cannot attract her attention. She simply forgets everything and only stares at the hands circling on the clock face. She looks so quiet; but she is not like an artist's "model." She is a lively fool, and also a stupid actor.</p>
<p>Her voice is low, steady, clear, and in the same tone, over and over again, sent into the broadcaster. She quickly reports the different hours, minutes, and seconds, but she also repeatedly warns you of the terrible fact—life is relentlessly passing away.</p>
<p>Every fifteen minutes, one person is replaced. This shift change is necessary in order to avoid subtle errors. Under long-term concentration, misreporting is unavoidable, because this work is monotonous and boring.</p>
<p>But this telephone can only be given by the speaker to the listener, so she cannot hear your words, and you cannot say "thank you." The reason for this feature is because one voice can be heard by others at the same time.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing is that a red light is always on as long as someone is listening. When no one asks, it goes out, so they can avoid unnecessary reporting and get a few seconds of rest.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the time service is considered very convenient and appreciated in the minds of every telephone user, because it provides service day and night. According to a recent survey, 6,380 people call to ask for the time in 24 hours. Translated from the North China Daily News.</p>
<h3>National Hero Series Opener</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>(II) Magistrate Wang</p>
<p>Wuxi County was originally a walled city, but over time, most of it had collapsed. In the thirty-third year of the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty, Japanese pirates harassed the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Magistrate Wang, upon learning of this, immediately planned to rebuild the city with stone walls, ordering his son, Ke Bao, to oversee the construction, working day and night without rest. Some workers requested a break, and Prince Wang, feeling compassion for them, allowed them a temporary rest. Coincidentally, Magistrate Wang came to inspect the work and was greatly enraged. Discovering the situation, he had his own son beheaded. None of the city's construction workers and many soldiers were not terrified. Afterwards, in just over sixty days, a sturdy city was built. When the Japanese pirates came, they besieged the city for a month before eventually dispersing. The people were safe, and the people of Wuxi, grateful to Magistrate Wang, built a living shrine to him on Mount Hui, and also built a long bridge to commemorate Prince Wang, calling it Ke Bao Bridge. The anti-Japanese hero is renowned, and Magistrate Wang fought bloodily to defend the isolated city. Remember, it was during the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty, when Japanese pirate troops harassed Jiangnan. Wuxi County originally belonged to Suzhou Prefecture, and its city walls were formed by mounds of earth. When the Japanese troops came to oppress them, the people of Wuxi were terrified. In those days, there was a virtuous magistrate, whose name was Wang Qidong, clearly remembered. He built a stone city to defend against the great enemy, and the work was quickly started, relying on the strength of the masses. Day and night, the work was hard, and people were exhausted, crying out repeatedly. Prince Wang's name was Ke Bao, and he supervised the work, toiling until the third watch of the night. The workers pleaded with Prince Wang, asking for a moment of leisure, hoping their sincerity would be appreciated. The prince was kind-hearted, and allowed the workers a temporary rest. The magistrate inspected the city walls and saw the workers snoring like thunder. He was so angry, his rage burned like fire. Discovering the truth, he was even more indignant. Alas, the iron-faced and selfless Magistrate Wang sacrificed his beloved son, executing justice by punishing his own offspring. The soldiers guarding the city were terrified, and the workers trembled with fear. Working through the night for just two months, a stone city appeared before their eyes. The [Japanese] troops could not breach the city, and the region was protected, the people and animals living in peace. To this day, Ke Bao Bridge still stands, filled with endless sorrow and contemplation of the past, the loyal soul forever associated with the clear springs of Hui.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, Blue Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Praising Renrui, a Deed Supporting Three Talents; Recounting Friendship, Two Scholars Meet Heroes</p>
<p>The two Miss He's also knew that this Doctor Zhang was an old maid who kept her chastity and never married, and also was Zhu Airen's adoptive mother. Zhu Airen was able to have this day entirely because of the training and nurturing of the old Doctor Zhang. And the prosperity of this hospital, the establishment of the orphanage, and the flourishing of this Anle Town, were all due to the efforts of this old Doctor Zhang. Therefore, they also respected her very much. That day, Zhu Airen led them to see the rooms prepared for the two of them. Although the rooms were small, they were very clean and tidy. Fortunately, they were next door to Zhu Airen's room, and they could talk at any time. When it was time for supper, including the old Doctor Zhang, there were seven or eight people at the table, and they ate very frugally. Among them were several female doctors who also lived in the old Doctor Zhang's residence. One of the female doctors, Liu Wenqiu, was the chief physician of the obstetrics and gynecology department, and she was in her forties this year, and had also graduated from the United States. This Doctor Liu was the old Doctor Zhang's cousin, and had never married either. Another female doctor, Ye Chuqing, was the chief physician of the pediatrics department, and she was about thirty years old, and had graduated from the United Kingdom. This Doctor Ye, her husband, was also a famous doctor, and already had a son and a daughter, two children. These two children were all in this orphanage. The two of them, husband and wife, were both engaged in medicine. Every year, only during the summer vacation, they would rest in a secluded place with water and trees, in the open mountains and forests, for two months, living their conjugal life. The old Doctor Zhang joked with the two of them, saying, "You two are like the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl, meeting on the magpie bridge at that time. However, the celestial stars, the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl, only meet for a short time, but you have two months, which inevitably makes the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl jealous. Moreover, after people get married, they have a honeymoon once, but you seem to have two months of honeymoon every year." Indeed, the son and daughter of Doctor Ye Chuqing were conceived during this summer honeymoon. After giving birth to these two children, there were still young ladies who asked her, "Doctor Ye! You can have a son or a daughter every summer vacation, so you can get a lot of sons and daughters every year." Doctor Ye Chuqing smiled and said, "Enough! I already have a son and a daughter, which is enough. If we were to have four children, and then eight from four, and then sixteen from eight, such a multiple increase would be terrible after a few generations. So our cattle breeding will stop here." Sure enough, her son was six years old, and her daughter was four years old, and she had no more children afterwards. (67)</p>

<h3>The War of Resistance and the Arts</h3>
<p>— Jin Ding</p>
<p>The War of Resistance has reached its second stage, and the road leading away from “final victory” is getting closer and closer. At this critical moment when the “final victory” is about to come, in addition to all the loyal and brave soldiers who defend the country and fight in bloody battles, all sectors of the country should also work together under the guidance of the supreme leader. Of course, the arts world, standing in front of the times, undoubtedly has to shoulder greater responsibilities.</p>
<p>From my point of view, in the arts world during the War of Resistance, in addition to all practitioners striving to implement the twelve “National Covenants” in the recent spiritual mobilization promulgated by the Central Government, they should also, when engaged in their work, insert as much material about the War of Resistance and national construction as possible to stimulate the minds of the general public, raise the emotions of the audience, and increase the audience's confidence that the “final victory” will be achieved. Make every audience member have the belief that "the War of Resistance will be victorious" and "national construction will be successful." This kind of spiritual construction has a very important relationship and influence on the future of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the film industry should redouble its efforts in the production of war-resistance films. The environment in Shanghai is certainly difficult and does not allow the opening of films with anti-war content; however, we can send these films to the inland for public screening. Because film is the most popular and powerful weapon in the anti-war cultural movement. The people in the inland need these films so much to increase their anti-war sentiments. As for the drama world and the spoken drama world, in the future, in addition to working hard on their own performances, they should also redouble their efforts in the production of new anti-war scripts; other reform movements, such as Peking opera and storytelling, are also matters of urgent importance. It is hoped that within their own possible scope, they will do more to fulfill their responsibilities for the anti-war work.</p>
<p>In short, the War of Resistance needs the arts, and the arts should not forget the War of Resistance, and there must be an inseparable relationship. Fellow artists, be encouraged.</p>
<h3>Talking about Some Famous Jingpai Qin Masters (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Qiu Jun</p>
<p>The Huqin in Peking Opera is a main musical instrument which cannot be separated for a moment from singing. Because the singing of the actors, except for Kunqu or Chuichang, requires the accompaniment of the Huqin. Generally, famous actors all have their own private Qin masters to help them. Here, I will first introduce several famous Qin masters of the Jing School, which I think the readers who are fans of the Qin would like to hear about.</p>
<p>Xu Lanyuan is Dr. Mei's Qin master. His hand tone is exceptionally round and smooth. He is very proficient in Kunqu. He has been with Wan Hua for many years. He is not only proficient in accompanying female roles, but also has a considerable understanding of male roles. I remember ten years ago, at the Peking Liyuan Association's performance of Wo Wo Tou Disaster Relief Opera, Yu Shuyan and Wan Hua performed You Long Xi Feng and Da Yu Sha Jia. At that time, Lanyuan played the Qin for Yu. The accompaniment of Lanyuan in the Xipi Kuai Sanyan section "Last night I drank too much..." can be described as perfect and seamless, which is amazing to listen to. In addition to playing the Qin, he also founded "Zhu Lan Xuan" in Liulichang, the old capital, to sell southern bamboo and also made and sold Huqin himself. He was especially humble and amiable in his dealings with people, without any airs of the Liyuan circle. He was also a skilled calligrapher and responded to all requests. People always called him "Master Xu."</p>
<p>Wang Shaoqing is the son of the old actor Wang Fengqing. He plays the Erhu with Wan Hua, relying on him as his right and left arm. He first learned Lao Sheng and then changed to Qin. His fingers are firm and crisp, and his wrist strength is extraordinary. He created his own style and became famous in the world. People call it the "Wang School." Today, those who play the Erhu all follow him. Try to listen to Wan Hua's records or stage plays to appreciate its mystery. Wan Hua's tunes are mostly the result of his research with Jiang Miaoxiang. The scene personnel of the Mei Opera Troupe are all under his command. He also plays the Huqin for his father and younger brother (Wang Youqing), such as in the plays Wen Zhao Guan, Zhan Changsha, and Zhusha Zhi. The speed of the bowing, the melodiousness of the support of the melody, can be called a masterpiece. When playing the Qin with his younger brother, he does not use the Erhu, but shakes it casually on the stage, and then adds Qiao San's drums, which makes people feel relaxed and happy. There is no one in the north and south of the Yangtze River who does not know his name. Because he is the second in the ranking, he is also called "Er Pian'er."</p>
<p>Yang Baozhong first sang Lao Sheng, hanging his sword for others as a second-rate actor. Later, he changed to Qin and became a student of Mr. Xi Zigang. He followed Ma Lianliang for nearly seven years. His fingering is clean and neat, and his wrist strength is also extraordinary. He has excellent relations with people offstage and often gets a good head start on stage. He is very strict in supporting Lianliang's tunes, singing support, singing harmony, and supporting the stage. Even the slightest breath, his bowing also pauses and turns in a methodical manner. It can be called a scientific Huqin. It is the opposite of Zhao Guiyuan, Lianliang's former Qin master, who was good at using the wrapping tune method. He also makes and sells Qin now and also has research on Western music. When Shang Xiaoyun performed Modern Girl, he often asked him to play the "violin" and was even more famous in the world for his drumming method of "Yuyang Three Strokes" in Ji Gu Ma Cao. Baozhong can be said to be versatile.</p>
<h3>Storytelling Arena News</h3>
<p>— Yuxiu</p>
<p>The owner of the Yi Yuan storytelling arena felt that the arena site was too narrow, which greatly affected business. Recently, he has rented the entire third floor of the Wanshang Tea House at the intersection of Fujian Road and Guangdong Road as the new site for the storytelling arena. The place is spacious, and the seats have been greatly expanded. In addition to doing the "Day and Night Sessions" completely (only the "Night Session" was done at Yi Yuan), he also plans to open "Early Morning" storytelling sessions to compete with Huiquan and Dazhong. The performers are mostly "Loud Performers," and the lineup is very "Strong," and it will be ready to open as soon as the arrangements are made.</p>
<p>This year, the Puyu Society has very few venues because there are not many members in Shanghai. Recently, there has been talk of greeting members from the Suxi area and opening up the Baihuating Tea Room in the City God Temple market as a new base in the Shanghai storytelling arena.</p>
<p>Ya Lu's "Night Session," the story of the White Snake by Yang Xiaoting and his son, is a perfect combination and is very popular with listeners, with a very strong appeal. The Zhang Fengxiang and his son's show was changed due to the fact that the new book (Record of War Zone Flowers) has failed to gain listeners, so they have reorganized to sing "Yu Qing Ting."</p>
<p>Zhang Hongsheng, who performs "One Show," at the Fengmingtai storytelling arena on Xinzha Road, is very economical in terms of time and pricing, and the attendance is not bad. As a result, Zhang Hongsheng's "Aircraft Heroes" has become a big hit again.</p>
<p>The Wu Xiaosong and Xiaoshi brothers have not shown their faces in the Shanghai storytelling arena for a long time. It is said that they have gone to Pingjin to sell their skills. Zhou Yuquan and Jiang Yueting have also recently received a letter from a certain person in Shenyang inviting them to do "Long-Term Shows." In addition to providing food and accommodation, the monthly salary is 200 yuan. Temporary short-term shows and other piecemeal "extracurricular" business can also be accepted at will without restrictions. After the "Scissors Book" at Huiquan Lou, Zhou Jiang may go north.</p>
<p>Since Fu Chunmu's "Night Session" won the King of Description, Xia Hesheng, the business has indeed improved a lot. Recently, it has been selling "300 bowls" every day, but the "Day Session" is still only 70 or 80.</p>
<p>The puppet organization in the South City, recently, in order to prosper the market, urged the storytelling arenas in the City God Temple to resume business. Although one or two unvirtuous venue owners accepted this proposal, they were all met with rejection when they went to the concession to invite performers, and none of them succeeded.</p>
<p>In Hollywood, there are many things that seem real and seem fake. Here is a shot from "Wuthering Heights": Merle Oberon and Alexander Korda are married. Under the distressed gaze of Merle Oberon's fiance, the guests throw flowers at them. It's really terrible! After the "wedding photo" was taken, Merle and Korda slipped into the actors' dressing room. Korda laughed, but Merle's expression was very serious.</p>
<h3>Gunga Din</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>Although the famous poet Rudyard Kipling's work "Gunga Din" has been around for forty-seven years; however, his vigorous spirit is still deeply imprinted in people's minds, so the sales of this book have never decreased, and it is truly a great work of literature! RKO Pictures saw this point and adapted it into a film. It cost a lot of money to make this film a great work with extreme financial and human resources!</p>
<p>Just talking about the scenery, this scene occupies a very wide area, which is vast and boundless! There are steep mountain roads and strangely dangerous peaks. Speaking of the actors, this is a war movie, with several scenes that do not use guns or knives: barehanded, so the three fighting actors, Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Junior Van Dyke, three lively stars, used all their skills to perform.</p>
<p>I don't seem to believe that such good writing can briefly narrate the story of that epic. So I can only tell the outline of a story. It is said that in India there is a very terrifying nation. They are very brave and good at fighting, and they believe in a cruel religion. The number of people killed is very, very high. So the British Indian Army, together with the local Indian Army, worked together to eliminate this nation. It tells the adventure story of three comrades who share life and death, and the heroic act of an Indian child who sacrifices his life for righteousness. Here there is a fierce battle for survival between nations, a voice of injustice for the Indian caste system. There are also the dangerous passes of Indian geography, the situation of garrison life. There are also many humorous jokes that are mixed in the extremely tense atmosphere.</p>
<p>This film is scheduled to be publicly screened at the Nanking Theater in this city today, and it is a work that can eclipse the brilliance of all the works produced by Hollywood in 1928.</p>
<h3>Arts News</h3>
<p>The Filming of "Movie City Chronicle" is Completed</p>
<p>"Movie City Chronicle," which has been publicized for a long time, has been completely completed. This is the first film with the theme of a photography studio. Lu Ming jumped to the throne of a red star in the film as a film editor, and later committed suicide by jumping from the twenty-fourth floor, which is quite intense and enthusiastic. "Mysterious Lady" is working quite vigorously. Wen Yimin is expected to "come out on top" in this film. At the same time, it is even more worth mentioning that the female celebrity Zai Huigu plays the role of a female assassin, which has already started filming and the results are very amazing. Sister Da, Cang Yinqiu, often protects her husband, Xiao Wang, to Yihua, because Xiao Wang has an important role in "Mysterious Lady." Diao Banhua was ill for a while last winter.

<p>Sino-French Drama School</p>
<p>The Sino-French Drama School held its first practical performance at the Great Auditorium of the French Municipal Council on Huanlong Road last Saturday and Sunday. The three plays performed, "Little Hero," had an accurate awareness; "Posing" was sharply satirical; and "Poppy" had profound implications. Therefore, it was warmly supported by people from all walks of life. However, because there were not many seats in the theater, hundreds of people were turned away. It is now specifically scheduled to be restaged on Saturday and Sunday of this week (25th and 26th) in four day and night performances, in order to thank the public for their kindness. The tickets for admission sold by the school in the previous performance are still valid. The location is still the same.</p>
<p>Leshan Association Righteous School</p>
<p>The first obligatory primary school run by the Shanghai Leshan Association is located at No. 3, Santai Lane, North Shansi Road. The houses are small and not enough to accommodate the students.

It was also decided to hold an entertainment conference to raise funds for the righteous school at the Lake Society Auditorium on Guizhou Road on the 25th and 26th of this month. The Oriental Troupe, Deng Guoqing Technical Troupe, and Yi Fangshuo Spiritual Troupe have agreed to participate in the performance voluntarily. In addition, it is planned to hire the Xianni Society to perform Kunqu Opera to entertain the audience. The association also has preferential measures. Anyone who sells ten theater tickets will be given a preferential ticket and a commemorative badge. The seat price is uniformly one yuan. The management offices are: (1) No. 20, Lane 392, Edouya Road, the association, and five other places, such as the Dakang Bank on Ningbo Road.</p>

<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (126)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Discussing the relationship between the Empress Dowager Cixi and An Dehai based on the story of "Visiting Mother"</p>
<p>According to the lyrics of the play "Visiting Mother," such as the sentence "Tears flow out of Yanmen Pass," it is always said that the pass that Yang Silang passed was Yanmen Pass, and it has been sung like this for many years. In fact, that is really inconsistent with the plot of the play, and the time and geography are all messed up. According to the explanation in the "Ciyuan," "Liao, the name of the dynasty, the surname is Yelv, initially named Qidan, later changed to Liao, lived in Rehe." It also says "Yanmen, the name of the prefecture, originally the Zhao territory of the Warring States period, the Qin and Jin prefecture, now the northern part of the old Daizhou in Shanxi, Ningwu, and the southern part of Shuoping, and the eastern and northern parts of Datong are all within its territory." The Classic of Mountains and Seas says: "Yanmen, wild geese fly out of it, also called Xingling. The area south of Yanmen is called Xingnan, and the area north of Yanmen is called Xingbei. The mountains on the east and west sides are steep and precipitous, and there is a road in the middle, winding and rugged. A pass is set at the top of the mountain, called the West Xing Pass, also known as Yanmen Pass, which has been an important place for garrisoning since ancient times, and is the so-called outer three passes with Ningwu and Piantou in Shanxi. The city of the pass leans against the mountain and follows the danger, standing as a huge defense." For example, the Ciyuan also explains Gubeikou as: "Gubeikou, a place name, is located in the northeast of Miyun County, Jingzhao. The cliffs on both sides are standing, and only one car can pass through, which is the main road from the inland to Mongolia. During the Qing Dynasty, the governor of Zhili was stationed here."</p>
<p>First, let's clarify the locations of "Yanmen Pass," "Gubeikou," and "Chengde," the provincial capital of Rehe Province (with a map for illustration). Then, the problem of the pass will be easily solved.</p>
<p>When Silang was sitting in the palace, he and the princess both showed that they were living in the inner courtyard of the palace in the lyrics and lines; it can also be proven by the lyrics "Peonies bloom, peonies release, flowers are red," and the scene of stealing the order on the court, and it can also be known that Empress Dowager Xiao and the princess and others were all in Chengde, the capital of Liao, and did not leave the capital and go to the front line like "King Song's imperial carriage to the northern frontier (lyrics sung by She Taijun)." From these two points of view, and then based on the lyrics "Ride fast and return overnight," we can determine that the pass that Silang passed must be very close to Chengde, so he dared to say to the princess resolutely: "Return immediately at the fifth watch." If there is a journey of one or two thousand miles, I am afraid that even if the horse that Silang is riding is as fast as the imperial horse stolen by Yu Dun (traveling a thousand miles in the day and eight hundred miles at night), it will not be possible to fly back to the Liao capital in time to hand over the order at the fifth watch. But if we compare the above map and study it, Yanmen Pass belongs to the territory of Daizhou and is the same as Ningwu and Piantou, being the three passes of Jin Province. Then, the distance between Chengde and Yanmen, in addition to separating a Chahar province, also has to add the distance from the border of Chahar to Chengde.</p>
