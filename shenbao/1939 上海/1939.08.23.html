<h3>國際局勢大轉變　蘇聯與德訂不侵犯條約　德外長今日飛莫斯科簽字　反共協定破產日本何處去</h3>
<p>莫斯科　蘇德締結商務信用協定後、繼有改進蘇德政治關係問題、關於此事、兩國政府交換意見之結果、已確定雙方均願緩和政治關係上之緊張局勢、從而消滅戰爭危機、並締結互不侵犯條約，因此、德國外交部長李賓特羅甫將於日內抵達莫斯科、從事應有之談判、（二十一日塔斯社電）</p>
<p>柏林　海通社自權威方面探悉、德國與蘇聯已同意簽訂互不侵犯條約、德國外交部長里賓特洛甫訂於八月二十三日乘飛機往莫斯科、外交部法制司司長戈斯傅士、參事胡威爾情報司司長史密特及著名譯員施密特白魯克美爾等多人隨行（二十二日每通社電）</p>
<p>拍林　里賓特洛浦外長率同隨員三十二人頃于木日午後乘飛機前往東普魯士省阿尼斯堡、當于明日午前轉往莫斯科、此間政界人士宣稱、一切問題均已經由外交途徑解決、一俟里賓特洛浦外長到達莫斯科、此項條約必可迅即完成云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　德蘇將簽訂互不侵犯協定之消息突如共來、此間日人各界萬不料兩國有此一舉、聞悉之下、似極沮喪、均稱反共公的今已毫無價値可言矣、（二十二路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　此間日木人士聞悉德蘇兩國商訂互不侵犯條的消息之後、甚爲驚異、日本大使大島將軍平日主張加入德義盟約甚力、頃於昨日午夜召集各重要館員舉行會議並於事後以長電拍寄東京大使館方面對於反共產國際公約前途命運甚爲焦念、（二十二日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>東京　今晨日內閣舉行例會時、會討論德蘇互不侵犯條的及英日會議兩事、外相有田謂、英日會談在實際上業已破裂、但日政府將於偵知英國眞正意旨後、決定其態度、有田叉以關於德蘇互不侵犯條的之情報、吿知各　員、並謂、此項情報、尙未完全云、閣員至此乃對於歐洲新局勢、交換意見、但未有何決定、陸軍省囚未接官方情報、亦不願發表意見、惟陸軍各界現對德蘇此種新舉動、予以嚴重注意、今晨陸軍省行政人員已舉行會議、大的陸軍省俟接到官塲情報後、將發表文吿、說明陸軍對於德蘇互不侵犯條的之態度、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　日本駐德大使大島與駐義大使白鳥、關於德蘇簽訂互不侵犯條的事之正式報吿、於今日午後三時送達外務省、外相有　即於午後三時三刻訪首相平沼於相邸、互談至四時二十分而散、開會討論日本所應採以應付此種新局勢之計畫，（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　據此間一般批評家之意、日本無論如何、業已受到一種痛苦敎訓、即防共公的之精神的約束、在希特勒之現實政策上、已無力量之可言矣、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　德國與蘇聯行將締結互不侵犯條的事、此出官塲方面聞悉之餘、極爲驚訝、均謂此後蘇聯西陲受有保障、其在達束行動、即可自由、於以見日本殆已被其歐洲各友邦所犧牲、至以英法蘇三國現行談判而論、自必感受深刻的影響、英法兩國所締造之安全系統、雖因此而受窒碍、但德義軸心思想上之觀點、却亦爲所推翻、德國佔據波希米亞暨摩拉維亞兩省之舉、旣已違反國社主義之種族學說、自今厥後、反共產主義十字軍一項原則、亦不復存在矣云、（二十二日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>英法當局　驚異恐慌殊甚　認爲和平陣線一大打擊　英國會聞將於明日復會</h3>
<p>倫敦　此間要津今日對於德蘇將訂互不侵犯條約之訉、不獨表示驚異、且表示恐慌、指此爲英國和平陣綫之大打擊、一般人以爲蘇聯政府因與英法商討數月迄無效果、未免厭倦、乃出其最後一着、如西方諸强仍不接受其條件、則蘇聯準備捨之、而聽令德國逞志於波蘭、如屬必要、德國且可對於謝絕蘇聯軍事援助之巴爾幹諸國伸其勢力、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　此間官塲，對於德蘇將締結互不侵犯條的事、尙未發表意見、各農報及非官塲方面對此消息皆表示驚異、每日郵報稱、如此說果確、則法蘇互助條的以及軸心國反共公的皆歸無效云、每日民聲報稱、今日而有此的、適直接鼓勵德國繼續其對波蘭之行動、換言之、即蘇聯方面邀請德國爲其所欲爲耳、英國此時宜立即召開國會、數日內和戰關键、即將決定云、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　經上下兩院反對黨之强硬申請後、兩院極有於星期四日復會之可能、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　非官場各界聞德蘇同意締結互不侵犯條的之宣布、大爲震驚、官塲對此現尙未作何批許、衆信此約幕後、王要人物之一必爲駐土德大使巴本、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　關于德蘇兩國商訂互不侵犯條的事、此問外交部方面人士咸皆含蓄其詞、僅謂、各該國前于一九二二年四月十六日訂有拉巴羅條的、迄今並未予以廢止、其現行關係仍以此項條的之議而有顯著的變更、德國各報現正大坎大擂、足見該國當局在心理上甚重視此事、各觀察家分析現行局勢、則謂蘇聯與英法兩國進行談判、進展甚緩、爰乃誘令德國提供保證、以視英法兩國所能提供者更進一步云、（二十二日哈瓦斯）</p>
<h3>英內閣　舉行會議</h3>
<p>倫敦　國際局勢繼續惡化、故今日之國務會議已改爲內閣全體會議、其結果如何、現極爲英國民衆所注意、倫敦官塲、以爲英政府之態度完全未變、鎭定堅强、依然如故、今日閣員所將考慮之事件中、有「英政府應再發宣言、重申其對於任何侵略行爲之熊度、」惟一般意見以爲英政府近來關於此事所發宜言、已極明白、似無熏新發言之必要、且以非必要之言論、激動情感、亦非所宜、惟閣員將就其所見、加以檢討、並採取其所認爲需要之步驟、內閣會議定今日午後舉行、故午前首相張伯倫有接見各閣員互相商榷之機會、路透社外交訪員聞諸官塲、軸心國是吾確知英法抱有決心、如波蘭因其獨立受威脅而與德國衝突、則英法必爲波蘭後盾此非倫敦所能予以答覆、惟民治國之熊度、其應爲軸心國所了解、可無待言、此間一般人咸承認、英政府已就其權力所及、以正確明白之詞句、說明其熊度與義務、藉以保障和平、英外相哈立法克斯曾於六月二十七日聲明、「萬一續有侵略行動發生、吾人决計立即運用吾人所有之全部力量、以履行吾人所發抵禦侵略之諾言、」首相張伯倫後亦切實聲明、外相所發之言論、可代表英政府經過考慮之政策、今日閣員在會議時、定將研究在政府所已行者之外、是否尙有其他方法、可使任何方面對於上述諾言之意義、不作絲毫疑念、以衆所知、曲解英國態度之任何努力、乃一種尋常技倆、其目的在動搖對於民治國之信任、而使中立國發生不良影響耳、英國國會之召集、或亦爲今日閣員所須考量之一問題、常國會休會以前、張伯倫會向下院保證、如覺有須召開國會之時局上發展、政府必在十月三日國會復開日期以前、召開國會、但張伯倫當時亦拒絕主張於八月二十二日召集國會臨時會議、故在今日首相與其他閣員、或尙以爲國會之召集、目前猶非必要、或尙非其時、下院反對派領袖格林武昨會至唐寗街訪晤張伯倫、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>日本三重打擊</h3>
<p>倫敦　此間中國官方及非官方人士、對於德蘇互不侵犯協定、均表示滿意、因此舉句使蘇聯無西顧之憂、而得在遠東自由應付一切也、據華方人士之意見、自美國宣佈廢止對日商的、英國拒絕討論中國法幣與天津存銀問題後、今復有該協定之締結、此使日本遭遇三重失敗、而不得不改變其全部政策矣、此間日官方則皆守緘默、日商界對於日本極端份子鼓吹加入軸心、本已不喜、今稱、德國在日之宣傳、迄今已完全成功、其始指導衆情反抗蘇聯、繼乃於最近數月來轉移其目標、使衆情集中反抗英國、今德蘇締結互不侵犯協定矣、日本當可了然於德國之言行不符、或將回復其往日之情緒、而與英國更相親善、亦屬可能云、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　關於德蘇兩國商訂互不侵犯條的事、此間各觀察家咸謂、德國曾在事前通告羲國、對於日本則吾、關於反共產國際公的命運如何、主管人士不願發表意見、僅請此項公的係以思想爲根據、互不侵犯協定則屬於政治性質、其對於德蘇兩國向第三國所接受之的束、並無何項妨害云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>化敵爲友　德報大書特書　並自鳴爲極大成功　德人則墜五里霧中</h3>
<p>柏林　柏林人士、見各晨報特戰德國與蘇聯行將締結互不侵犯條的之消息、咸大訝異、蓋國社主義之日耳曼與布爾希維克主義之俄羅斯兩個主義逈異之國家、竟一旦倐然改變其相互關係、此誠爲始料所不及、德國各報皆以極大標題、登載此項消息、國社黨機關報且於全面正張上印八吋長之紅字標題兩道、惟各報未著一字評論、讀者如墜五里霧中、蓋不知德國究將採何種途徑也、德蘇談判進行時極守秘密、除少數最高級官員外、殆無人知之、即政府發言人亦未有不表示極大驚異者、柏林外國政界中人認此爲德國極大之成功、將使歐洲政局爲之全變、並認此爲更重要的發展之起點、德國此舉、在德國對西班牙與日本關係上之影響、究將如何、世人現以甚大之與趣注視之、衆料日本對於德蘇之接近、殆極感失望、因日本無疑的向來依頓其對德之更密切關係、以期不利於蘇聯也、德國政界對此條的、甚爲欣悅、謂此事倐出包國國之不意而爲之云、（二十二日路透電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>蘇德商訂互不侵犯條約</h3>
<p>蘇聯德意志兩國即將簽訂互不侵犯條的，此在報章爲意外消息，在國際爲意外變局，在政治家爲意外敎訓。</p>
<p>申論其事，應先明辨事之輪廓。據德意志國家通信社海通社昨日即八月二十二日柏林電稱：德國與蘇聯已同意簽訂互不侵犯協定，外交部長里賓特洛浦定於二十三日飛赴莫斯科；隨行者其僚屬法制司宣傳司二司長等。據蘇聯國家通信社塔斯社昨日莫斯科電稱：蘇聯與德意志兩國政府交換意見之結果，已確定雙方均願緩和政治關係上之緊張局勢，以冀消滅戰爭危機，締結互不侵犯協定；德國外交部長數日內即抵莫斯科，從事應有之談判。二國二社各自其首都發佈電訉，各有所詳，要旨則一；總之，雙方皆表示簽訂互不侵犯條的之殷願，但有待談判，尙未確立。</p>
<p>在此尙未確立之際，理應視爲成敗兩可。以迄於談判之結束。蓋所謂互不侵犯條的，所具內容儘可不拘一格，亦即條款儘可發生問題；問題所在，安見其必諧。姑舉疑竇：侵犯與吾，爲狹義乎，爲廣義乎？侵犯未及於訂的國之本土，顧本上而外，非有所謂生存攸關之鄰邦，亦得侵犯之乎？攫彼生存攸關之鄰邦而未以武力，得不謂侵犯乎？蘇聯與英法之談判，以波羅的海三國安全之保障問題爲一折，以間接侵略之界說爲又一折，蓋蘇聯視三國爲蘇聯生存攸關者也；蘇聯力爭之於英法者如彼，妥協之於德國者如何？本報嘗稱「蘇聯應付一切問題，絲毫不苟；」苟之德國，事所必無；是以蘇德談判之前途，不應視爲絕無問題</p>
<p>雖然，我人甯願以種種觀點而論斷於蘇德兩國談判締結互不侵犯條的之即告成立。換言之：兩國談判之問，縱有種種內在外鑠之疑難，但雙方殷願之互不侵犯條的，不惟不以疑難而流產，抑且不致難產，迅速完成。茲不遑申論我人如此論斷之所根據，姑假定諭斷之未謬，取爲根據而申論之。</p>
<p>蘇德兩國締結互不侵犯條的正式簽字成立之後，至少自最近一年（？）以來，凡關國際之一切：各國之外交政策，軍備標準，友敵分野，主義論衡：無論已經公開之事實形態，埋頭猛幹之計畫方案，鈎心鬭角之進退趨避，宣傳鼓動之雷雨風雲；無一而不須另行估價，另行考慮；甚至於必須重起爐灶，澈底更張。縷析言之，言不勝言。誠以互不侵犯條的之本質，似屬消極防止而非有積極作爲；今之主角，似僅蘇德兩方，而無與於其他各國；然其影響之大，將爲最矜持者所不復能故示鎭靜。</p>
<p>是何影響？以訂的之主角而論：蘇聯方面對於國社主義之德意志，旣以立國之先天素質，彼此水火，復以德國爲反共國際公的之中心，遂致兩國對峙極尖銳之致；今以互不侵犯條的之吿成，乃如水火異器，各有千秋；此其意義。雖視爲彼此對於對方之主義，相承認相尊重，素質上相諒相安：此一也。兩國對峙，德國對蘇聯夙昔表示不妥協，而德國之侵略政策，允隨時隨地示人以將及鋒而試，此爲蘇聯所深感不安；緣是而與法國先有互助之的，與英法續談互助之方，要之，蘇聯自覺不能無友好，不能孤立於歐局漩渦之外；今以互不侵犯條的之告成，蘇聯在歐洲非惟無仇敵，且已越其惟一之戰壕而與所敵握手言歡；此二也。蘇聯疆域跨歐亞兩洲，而德意志與日本夙相結納，儼然扼其東西首尾；今以互不侵犯條的之告成，蘇聯無復西顧之憂；爾後蘇聯是吾將在遠東有所作爲，乃另一問題，然自此具有自由作爲之可能，具有全力作爲之可能；此三也。</p>
<p>德國方面，自希特勒爲元首，整軍經武，雄心勃勃，對於東歐中歐目無全牛；即對於西歐，亦蔑如也。惟獨蘇聯，不僅立國主義之不相容，亦爲軍備軍略上之唯一勁敵，觀於希特勒元首之言論，氣燄萬丈，而久已不復攻訐共產，可知顧忌之甚。及亡捷克，英法發奮爲雄，於是有莫斯科遂爲英法所趨蹌；誠使蘇聯慨然接受英法之所願望而沆瀣一氣，形成强毅有爲之集團，德國雖欲飛躍，終無以突破「包圍」者之掌握；至侵略政策之致命傷，亦國社政權之催命符，希特勒所大恚也。茲乃與蘇聯締結互不侵犯條的，此其意義，雖非德國獲至友，侵略獲帮兇，然直接則蘇聯非復爲德國之敵人，間接則蘇聯不復助英法爲敵人。自希特勒主宰德政，此乃外交上空前之絕大成功。</p>
<p>此所影響及於國際大局者，重要關鍵凡二：（一）互不侵犯條的之內容，關於條的存廢殆必有所規定；若規定訂的國之一方，對於第三國有何侵略行爲時，訂的國之他一方得宣告廢的；若是則國際大局將因此而間接獲得相當之穩定力量。（二）德國於簽訂此條的之後，如何意念？如何氣槪？如何作爲？在蘇聯默契之下，求所以貫澈其願望者，將取如何途徑？如何方式？舉未可卜也。此二關鍵者，要皆繫於德方。二者之外，個別研求其影響；德國對但澤，士心在必得，當然不以捐棄其對於但澤之願望，作爲取得蘇聯簽訂互不侵犯條的之代價；且以但澤之地理與歷史言之，以其經濟與血統言之，波蘭自亦勢難久於持有但澤；抑允不惟但澤成爲問題而已。是以蘇德互不侵犯條的成立之影響所及，苦悶徬徨，甚至悲哀，當以波蘭爲最近而最著。德義日本號稱盟好，德義實，德日虛；外交上交相呼應是眞，信仰上共同反共是僞；日本對歐局不願力助德義，德義在遠東豈甘斷送市塲：日本對中國想獨吞，德義對中國無宿怨；然日本以爲德義樂爲所用，以爲反共可資號召，於是國際大局旣醖釀演進至於別一境界，而日本則刻舟求劍，猶以爲反共公的有充實之必要，猶有充實之妙用焉；詎知德國已拔反共之幟，徵義國同意而與蘇聯商訂互不侵犯條的，日本猶在鼓中，猶在門外！是以此後日本將如何自處，爲別一問題，然在國際因此而愈證明其爲孤立，則爲不爭之事實。至於英法，獲此絕大之敎訓，必有深刻之心得；彼半年來追求蘇聯，期以爲政治軍事之與國，當蘇聯之不安於德國侵略氣燄爲，非不動心，及今而蘇德各得其所，英法功敗垂成，是誠無殊由相戀而單戀而失戀。以外交論英法，失敗之甚；然英法與蘇聯之談判旣不因此半途而廢，他日所得成就者亦至少等於德國與蘇聯之關係：况英法之國力國威，惟有自侮，而爲他人所不敢輕侮；是以英法雖遭可憫之頓折，而實際仍無所削弱也。</p>

<h3>史丹林　外交政策的動向</h3>
<p>本年三月十五日德國併吞捷克後、英首相張伯倫即向蘇聯建議締結英法蘇三國反侵略同盟、以抗德義軸心、蘇聯立刻接受、雙方開始談判、迄今已逾五月、還在談判之中、國際大局危急達於極度、却如此從容不迫、好整以暇、這眞是外交史上罕見之舉、這全由張伯倫懐着鬼胎、生怕同盟成功後、英法蘇三國將德國打倒、蘇聯的勢力達到中歐、將來極難對付、但同時又因爲德國的侵略、形勢凶險、所以相借着和蘇聯談判同盟、繼續推動他的綏靖政策、希望德國因此就範、以成苟安之局、希特勒是何等角色、怎會被人嚇倒、史丹林又是何等角等、怎甘彼人利用、結果德國的侵略、步步加緊、蘇聯的同盟、也成了泡影、據圾近電傳、蘇德　簽定信用放款協定、接着又將締結互不侵狂協定、不知張伯倫對此、將有何神通可施、下文載見美國出版的「現代史科一、對於史丹林的外交政策、闡述很明、讀之可以知道英蘇談判遲遲不能成功的原因、至於文末希望史丹林加入民治國方面、勿加入軸心國方面、那是美人的立塲、當然作此主張、總之、蘇德互不侵犯協定如果成立、或者再有更進一步的舉動、那全是張伯倫的「不誠意」的果報啊、　譯者</p>
<p>「使蘇德兩國相互戰圖、這是英國之福、因爲這兩國打得頭破血流、英國便能更見强盛」、當蘇聯人民委員會主席莫洛托夫五月三十一日演說外交政策的當兒、大可發生動的語句、這番演說、雖仍開啟英蘇繼續談判的門戶、但他認英法兩國所提出拉攏莫斯科成立反侵略協定的建議、實不充分、故已予以拒絕、</p>
<p>當本年三月間蘇維埃共產黨太會舉行時、史丹林本人演說中也大可發此一言、史氏當時會抨擊西歐民治國希圖增高蘇聯對德的敵愾、毒化空氣、激動蘇聯無明白的理由和德國啟　、其實這句話在世界大戰爆發前兩個月、即一九一四年五月二十三日帝俄國會開會時、早就發過、表示對英國的不信任、那是極端筏古帝制派議員馬哥夫所發、這位堅决擁護羅曼諾夫皇室獨裁的議員當時曾發値得紀念的演說、表示俄國對英國所供獻的禮品、永永懐疑、馬哥夫說道、「英國的友誼、僅在沒有積極援助俄國的需要時、才能存在、……吾人倘若和德國締結小小的聯盟、那比和英國成立偉大大的友交、還好多哩、今日在二十五歲後第二次世界大戰似乎又將發作的前夕、史丹林又見英國以和前同樣的震顫、勉强把手伸出了、前番伸出時、沙皇尼古拉二世左右的拉斯浦丁（即帝俄之妖僧）的朋黨、曾因此起煩擾、這番伸手，蘇聯的民眾自也不免紛加猜疑、至於蘇聯輿情對於本國外交政策、完全處於黑暗之中、那是因爲十年來的布爾希維克主義的革命宣傳、已把「蘇聯是俄羅斯」的明白事實、大大地抹煞去了、</p>
<p>蘇聯今須抉擇政策、地的去取、至有關係、這在决定蘇聯和世界的前途上、確將佔一有果斷性的部份、這個决斷、操於一個人、即史丹林之手、若以爲他已完全破壊他往日任革命的布爾希維克黨時所成的遺績、那是一種錯解、他的全部政治訓練、是在列寗指導下得到的、在列寗的心目中、、俄羅斯絕不是一個國家、</p>
<p>列寗的學理、大牛在亡命於國外、住在倫敦·斯托克賀姆、（瑞典京城）日內瓦·慕尼黑·克拉哥·蘇利克的陋室中制定的、他是一位國際主義者、不但因爲他曾讀過馬克思的著作、並且囚爲他成年之後、大部分的生活是以一個無國之人度着的、他趁着一般社會大變動、和歐洲戰時戰後混亂的時期、攫得大權、他見世界的各國都將臨到終局、一種國際勞工的獨裁制、將應運誕生、起而代之、他抱着這種信仰、親手簽定白萊斯特列托夫斯克和的、把歐洲的俄國土地斷送三分之一、原來他誠挚相信只要俄國布爾希維克黨能够保留短時期的權力、到了「審判的紅日」歐洲全部各國的界綫、都會消滅無餘的、直到他臨終之日、他　免出席國家權力政冶的會議、</p>
<p>史丹林却和列寗大不相同、雖然他生在喬治亞省、他比早年流亡在歐洲、常從此一　奔至那一都的列寗信徒、較爲俄羅斯化、他在俄國革命以前、罕居帝國境外、他加入布爾希維克黨後、仍住在俄國各城村、有時住在西比利亞僻遠的地方、在他看來、「國際勞工制」永遠不外乎是列寗信仰的一種抽象物、他的經騐、全從和俄國農工以及警察結交得來的、</p>
<p>列寗死後小久、史丹林便打破布爾希維克主耍的信條、而布爾希維克需國際運動塲達其目的是、托洛資基和齊諾維夫繼統擾攘於國除勞工運動、和世界革命、史丹林却日漸轉其目光、注於俄羅斯帝國、和她的人民及無限的資源上、史丹林竟獲勝了、</p>
<p>十二年來、史丹林在往日沙皇理政的宮中隻手指揮蘇維埃聯邦的政策、最近數年十、却盡共權力內所能爲一切、使俄羅斯全民愛國主義重行蘇生、他鼓勵人民讀那往日視爲中等社會和復古派而禁讀的名家著作、蘇聯電影院現已開映早年俄維斯各親王和沙皇的戰績、視爲國家的光榮、這在列寗時代是萬萬不許的、蘇聯報紙現復積極以「母國」二字爲宣傳題目、這二字在往年是認爲最和革命及國際主義相反對的、他又訓導人民爲了俄國的土地、値得奮鬥、縱犧牲生命、也在所不惜、史丹林的外交政策、便在這種氛圍之中展開、這又是使他的外交政策受人了解的背景、蘇聯最近的外交行動、全以國家自己的利益爲支配、這可用蘇聯亡命客在國外所辦的報紙作一最佳的證據、這些報紙對於史丹林很爲寡情、而對於布爾希第克的外交政策、更爲不喜、一種是在一九一七年短命的俄國民治共和政體下任外長的米留哥夫敎授在巴黎所辦的日刋、另一種是在那業政府任總理的克倫斯基所辦的兩月期刋、這兩種出版物都由住在蘇聯有權威的秘密訪員隨時供給消息、它們在世界得到蘇聯外交政策將有變動的絕微影子好久以前、早已料到這點、米留哥夫的報紙指明在一九三八年九月慕尼黑會議至本年三月捷京普拉格被佔之間、蘇聯必曾以大批貨物售與德國、</p>
<p>慕尼黑會議以後、希特勒即制定以捷克東郊建立自治的卡巴阡烏克蘭邦方案、而用巨余鼓勵烏克蘭的分立運動、西歐列强對此並不作重大憂慮、以爲德軍攻入蘇聯的烏克蘭、便在眼前了、但在三月間這一片土地却讓給匈牙利、於是希特勒的計畫便擱起不提、柏林和莫斯科間的關係融洽、却使倫教唐寗街上號的神經大爲不寗、蘇聯已明白無疑地回至國家權力政治、共產黨對於史丹林向德國賣弄風情、頗爲惶惑、但這是志在對待最近希圖犧牲蘇聯以慰希特勒者的一種策略運動、所以這種運動的本旨、是要保存蘇聯爲一歐洲强國的地位、已往百年中、俄國和英國交往的經騐、實使莫斯科對待英國、「舉一動、都須謹愼、帝俄往日曾見英國在亞細亞洲、在遠東、在博斯波魯斯、在巴爾幹、獨佔優勢、以制敵方、</p>
<p>僅僅蘇德親善的可能性、使大不列顚爲勢所迫、不得不依平等的條件、或全無條件、和蘇聯相交往、因爲能使英國着急的、只有這套把戲、</p>
<p>就國際共產運動而論、蘇聯和德國諒解、實爲一致命打擊、因爲第三國際機關歷　來的宣傳、是以反法西斯爲主旨、但就蘇聯國家安全立塲而論、這種計謀、並非沒有正當理由的、史丹林在共產黨大會中曾說道、「吾人的憲法、是世界中最民治化的、這個事實、無人敢發疑問、」</p>
<p>這在紙上、的確近乎眞誠、處於中途的補救　句、却寥寥無幾、或已被消滅、或仍存在着、把它當作現存的權利和自由的一種特許證、固爲其文、但它却有宣傳的作用、這種憲法的創立、是培植愛國主義和國家良知、以應付戰爭危險的在熱努力的一部分它像鬼影一般、飄蕩在克里姆寗宮的上空、</p>
<p>在西歐民治國方而作戰的最後任務、和因此可博得自由的渺茫託辭、大足爲一種刺激物、那是蘇聯人民冀獲政治自山被抑未仲的志願所正需的、一個蘇聯國家執戈和英法駢肩作戰、以抗一九三九年全能國的原則、甚至如一九一四年的國聯、那已搖動了專制主義、</p>
<p>史丹林對於要求明白加入西歐民治國、而舍棄專制的德國一點、不能盲目無覩、然而他對於蘇聯站在被侵略者的一方面、已造成了她是一個注軍和平的國家的景象、已用若干計劃反　叮嚀愛謢國家、已明悉世界輿情的大部分、而不論它是正確、或錯誤、所以他在決議中却不能有所選擇了、</p>
<p>蘇聯現享着很大的國際威望、而超過最近歷史中的任何時代、即最頑固的握權者也不能輕輕把這種威望拋棄不顧、他無諭取那條途徑、都有着危險、不過他若和希特勒沆瀣一氣、那在蘇聯人民和世界輿情眼光中、蘇聯便要立刻喪失道德的身分、</p>
<p>蘇聯現在和一九一四年相同、不得不決定去取、這種去取、須超出她的獨裁者個人的好惡、史丹林旣被有歷史性的動蕩所迫、不得不以蘇聯的利益、代替世界革命的怪物、現必須注意時局的變化、而取悲壯英勇的途徑、</p>

<p>本局對於此次之不幸事件、不獨認爲不負責任、且認爲應就上海特別市政府警察之行動、向貴市政府提起抗議、爲維持治安秩序起見、貴市政府顯然有採取措置之必要、俾預防將來有同樣情事、在本局之馬路上發生、本局警務處之人員、在本局之馬路上巡邏、自屬合法、</p>
<p>有何爭執願付仲裁</p>
<p>就調査結果所得之證據而論、本局深信上述之結論、完全基於事實、倘上海特別市政府對於本局所査明之事實、有何爭執、本局願將該事件交與雙方可表同意之人士、請其實行公正之調查、</p>
<p>日本領事亦提抗議</p>
<p>關於上述之事件、日本總領事亦有抗議提出、已於昨日送達工部局、該局已將所致上海特別市政府覆文之意旨、通知日本總領事、並向該總領事表示、願提出全部證據、以便實行公正之調查、</p>

<h3>虹橋路中山路口　攔刦運滬菜蔬　强曳菜販登車押往虹口出售　浦東菜蔬已被虹口市塲統制</h3>
<p>關於日方企圖統制浦東蔬菜、以有所顧忌而作罷後、滬西虹橋路中山路口、又復發生日人攔截菜販、車運虹口之事、緣自本月廿日起、虹橋路中山路口、於淸晨四五時至七八時、及下午二時至六時、每有四五日人、伺立該處、其旁且停有卡車一輛、凡見有經中出路而入租界之菜販、即强取其所担負之蔬菜瓜果、裝入卡軍、並將</p>
<p>菜販四人</p>
<p>（最多只限四人）强曳入車、風馳電掣而入虹口、惟有一點堪注意者、即駐守該處之日軍、並不加以干涉、兼且有知照菜販、覓他途趨避者、至於隨同卡車入虹口之菜販、是吾取得代價、運至何處、現尙未悉、詢之地貨業中人、則謂確有人目諸此事、並預料此事或尙</p>
<p>未爲日軍</p>
<p>當局所知、與日前統制浦東蔬菜事如出一轍云、叉悉閘北大場八字橋一帶、去年春間、日方會遣移台民三千餘、佔據該處民房、從事種植瓜果菜蔬、產量甚豐、惟專供日軍各部隊所需、設有剩餘、再送虹口市塲發賣、華人欲返家理其舊業者、台人反向其征收租費</p>
<p>鵲巢鳩佔</p>
<p>事亦無可奈何、又昨據消息、浦東方面已開始强迫菜販將担菜運入虹口市塲、轉批租界菜販、從中收取佣金、另一辦法則爲將菜担經虹口市塲過磅抽捐、仍許其人租界售賣、</p>
<h3>虹橋區徵收　買路錢　昨由日兵阻車　每車索洋五角</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今日（二十二日）午前、駕汽車駛於虹橋區者、見日兵兩名在虹橋路華倫路口、攔阻汽車、而向每軍素洋五角、頗爲驚奇、昨日千後、係「大道警察駐守該地、惟每車索洋一元、此事實屬疑團、蓋此等道路係工部局所有而維持者、今竟索取「修路費、」工部局與領事署當局刻正</p>
<p>研究此事</p>
<p>尙無行動、昨晚至今晨九時、驚汽車經該地者、未見收稅員、若輩似於已所願時、始往「辦公」、據卜居虹橋區某君稱、收稅員昨日所得或不出二十元、因彼等對經過之汽軍並不設法盡行欄阻之也、今晨有詢日籟收稅員、何以僅收五角而非一元者、據答、昨有人在上海對所徵此稅、大發不平之言、謂該路係工部局所有、日人因此感覺不宜徵收一元、故今日</p>
<p>僅收半數</p>
<p>其餘半數、留任工部局徵收之、又據字林報云、某英僑昨日（二十一日）午後不久駕軍沿華倫路前駛至虹橋路附近、因拒不繳「費」一元、遭「大道」警察一名出盒子砲威脅、該英僑知不繳「費」而圖繼續西駛、將冒生命之險、乃駛返公共租界、據該英僑聲稱、虹橋路華倫路交又處、駐有「大道」</p>
<p>警察三名</p>
<p>攔阻西行汽車、汽車甫停、即有便衣服者一人、出印就之英文通吿書交汽車夫、謂自昨日午刻起、汽車經過、均須繳「費」一元、收得之款、充修路之用云、其他駕車經過者、亦遭攔阻、繳付所索之數後、即得一收據、准許繼續前駛、不受留難、收據於一天內有效、當日可</p>
<p>任意駛過</p>
<p>若干决、不須復付、昨據工部局某員答覆關於此事之詢問云、該兩路係界外馬路、今由工部局工務處不時加以修理、而昨日傍晚前赴該兩路一行、見路面在優良狀態中、按「大道」當局對使用工部局所築而維持之馬路者、作收「費」企圖、</p>
<p>此非初次</p>
<p>惟此前數次、工部局着手對付此事時、「大道」當局恒中止其企圖、外僑被「大道」警察確實出槍威脅者、昨日猶屬首决、自日軍侵佔虹橋區以還、警務處即不在該區行使職務、</p>

<p>商會將請　政府收回</p>
<p>又據上海市商會消息、該會業已接到上海郵政管理局答復該會向郵局提出三項建議之正式復函，第悉該會以執在小販手中之汚損郵票、不能由郵局收回、認爲攸關貧民生計甚鉅、故尙將逕向政府機關繼續請求、惟請求機關之對象及方式、須取决於委員會、</p>
<p>平民小販　昨晨請願</p>

<h3>金融　德蘇將締互不侵犯條約　外滙愈益鬆動</h3>

<p>九月美滙已出六元</p>
<p>後市因香港復來電塞且華行亦有賣意、致市勢穩中帶硬、計華行與港電相繼塞予匯豐等外行現貨英金三辦士半及五三一二五、並現貨美匯六元八一二五、入後華商紗花帮亦賣予外行有利等九月份美匯六元一八七五及二五、時某美行九月份美匯六元三一二五、尙無納胃、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金三辦士半、美匯六元八二五、本月份三辦士四八四三七五、美匯六元七八一二五、九月份英金三辦士一八七五、美匯六元一八七五、結果比上日、現貨英略鬆〇三一二五、美微硬〇六二五、本月份英賤〇一五六二五、美長〇三一二五、九月份英鬆一二五、美硬二五、</p>

<h3>港幫見低即進　黃金不易下跌</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、當日尙無劇變、但起伏仍不定、大致先漲繼跌而後盤旋、初因香港帮納胃甚健、且外滙趨勢頗平、售者不力、一度盤高至四千五百八十五元、嗣以突聞路透社消息、德蘇同意簽訂互不侵犯協定、是以外雁趨鬆、致塲中亦賣風四起、且一時缺乏維持、價遂直瀉至四千五百元低盤、但轉瞬間證券帮趁低猛吸、延至午收即回高至四千五百六十元、午後外滙略帶硬勢、故買者多覜望不前、加以某錢兌業等相繼吐塞、價遂重跌至四千五百三十元、結果以四千五百三十五元收盤、較上日又續降十元、但經營者仍視歐洲與國內政局之趨勢爲目標、交易尙旺、的千兩光景、銀樓飾金終日無變、海關金與中英純金等仍一致呆定、</p>
<p>烚赤再小十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開頗平、首由錢兌業進銀樓帮十兩、價爲四千五百四十元、較之前收做低五元、開後某銀樓代客吸收、兼錢兌業亦有買意、致價不久抬高三十元、錢兌業互做三十兩、四千五百七十元、時銀樓帮與現金號頻來塞出、價遂向下立撳二十元、銀樓帮售予金號三十兩、爲四千五百五十元、此後某銀樓復來吸購、加以某金號及錢兌業等亦先購買、故重轉向上、未幾抬高三十五元、錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩、爲四千五百八十五元、十時半後突聞路透社消息、德蘇將簽定互相不侵犯條的、同時又因外匯報硬、人心頓挫、一時進者觀望、錢兌業與散戶等改進爲出、且現金號賣意頗切、價竟傾瀉八十五元、錢兌業互做二十兩價爲四千五百元、此後因聞外滙轉平、證券帮等趁低力吸不久回起六十元、證券帮進銀樓帮十兩、爲四千五百六十元作午收價、午後開市即做小五元、錢兌業賣予金號十兩、四千五百五十五元、嗣聞外匯穩中帶硬、雖某銀號稍來吸納、但某錢兌業賣意頗濃、價續挫二十五元、錢兌業互做十兩、爲四千五百三十元、入後某銀號又進錢兌業二十兩、爲四千五百三十五元、作晚收價、結果比上日又續跌十元、全天八十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價照烚赤較高千元、現標金照掛牌金低六十五元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金仍懸原價</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、始終無變、計大同行仍顯原價四百六十元、新同行為四百五十八元、收進的减低二十元光景、</p>
<p>中英純金不動</p>
<p>二十一日倫敦電、英純金每盎斯仍呆定於七鎊八先令七便士、致中央銀行之各行市價、亦悉與上日相同、</p>
<h3>貼現轉低</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、轉高為低、每千元初會做高近二百元關口、但不久即漸回下　午刻一百九十五元、下午甚平、最後爲一百九十五元、較之前日回低二元半、錢業公會拆息未更、早午兩市均開一角七分云、</p>
<h3>英鎊獨漲</h3>
<p>昨日外幣英美金鎊、供給稀少、英金鎊獨漲、美金鎊穩定、英美金票則以外滙轉鬆、烚赤盤旋疲軟關係、下降有力、香港票先升後降、結果未更、法郞安南票未見需要、市况軟弱、澳金蔡因夾令票軟弱、追隨下降、日金票需要頗盛、市况緊昂、晚市錢兌業售出爲一元二角、朝鮮票甚穩定、晚市售出爲一元零一分、其他各稱穩定、昨日市價、英令鎊升五角、英金票降一元五角、美金票降二角、法郞票降一分二厘、安南票降一角五分、澳金票降一元、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>海外銀價暴漲</h3>
<p>倫敦二十一日大條銀市電、　起劇烈長風、印度及投機家貿進、缺少供給、致近遠期均猛長四三七五、收市後市况堅挺、印度照掛牌價高〇六二五買進、出者保留、又紐的電、美銀脚地亦堅俏、現貨飛長一分一二五、達三角六分半、又孟買電、印銀飛長允勁、現期貨均狂長三十九安那、（二羅比七安那）、一致躍至四十八羅比之上、市况後趨平靜、成交單僅五十張、交易仍稀云、</p>
<h3>糧食　高粳做開三十九元　各路新貨源源來　午後市勢已回平</h3>
<p>杜米　各區新貨來源漸多、昨河下共到松汀帮早晚稻十四號、車輪包子除有林涇貨一千餘包外、更到嘉善嘉興新尖八車、計一千餘包、蕪湖與南京新陳各尖一萬餘包、故人心稍懈、早市承隔昨餘波、喊聲仍高、續漲一二元、惟終以本街店胃觀望、晚市即趨下降、結果適成定局、而覜後市趨勢、似有難以立足之象、計做開高錫粳三十九元、中三十八元、常州鮮粳三十九元、蘇同崑梗三十八元半至三十八元、松江及南港河下早晚稻開三十五元至三十四元、原包三十七元半至三十六元三角、高陳陳蕪尖三十六元至三十五元、新蕪尖三十四元至三十三元、糯米未聞做開、統計全市成交七千餘包、</p>
<p>客秈　昨晨買氣仍旺、高檔京蕪秈竟有三十五六元之喊價、旋因各路新秈已經見樣、而江北新到之一千五百包亦已駁到、且京蕪江北一帶秈米、均由輸車轉輾運申、數雖不多、人心已稍安定、且聞米業正向日方耍求蕪米護照十萬包、故後市售價已見回平、</p>
<p>洋米　昨無正式交易，行囤存貨扳俏擯守、惟聞本市各工廠團體已有多起小票購定、共數目自三五十噸至三五百噸不一，定價二三號西貢在四十元左右、一號高西貢四十四五元、</p>
<h3>米貴風潮中　粉銷激增　小麥到貨續旺　售價逼近十元</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨現粉交易、續呈活躍、蓋緣米貴風潮中、粉銷與日俱增、各粉號門市零售者、頗有應接不暇之勢、所以本街實銷突旺、各廠爲維持民食計、不得不照常供給、惟大票交易與客帮整銷仍爲拒絕、統市成交由二萬餘包增至三萬餘包、聞回籠貨有客囤之垂青、交易頗佳、價仍超過廠盤二角以上云、</p>
<p>小麥　來源仍多、各路到貨的有六七千包、各廠以本街粉銷活動、原料需要頗殷、囤戶拉進者亦屬不少、且產價高昂、及米貴風潮中貨方一味居奇、不願輕脫、統市售開蘇州·直塘。無錫·安亭·揚州·崑山·南京。常州·奔牛·丹腸·烏衣·戚墅堰等麥共五十車、除由福新阜豐兩廠辦去二十二車外、其餘均由囤戶購進、價較前日又升二三角、最高價達九元九角八分、</p>
<h3>油餅　投機大量　囤進油豆</h3>
<p>雜糧油豆餅承上日餘風、繼續直綫上騰、業外不惜貴價搜羅、允以金融界爲最烈、業中國稍益覺殷切、市價一日三變上午豆油續漲一元外、成交各油一千餘件又一千五百聽、花生油做開五百聽、猛升一元半、黃豆再升一元至元半、開出七八百包、其他各種雜糧跳漲四五角不等、（行情均詳市價欄）、午後市上有利本謠風、人心浮動、潛勢稍挫、大局不脫大漲小回之格、</p>
<p>二十二日豆子三千包自北沙來、</p>
<h3>紗花　客銷轉滯　紗市反映驟起　雙地球猛跌念元外</h3>
<p>紗市開高收低、趨勢徬徨、此種狀態、已經四五天、但連日購辦熱鬧之港帮、今則亦轉沉悶、實則該處環境欠佳、對於購買商品暫行休息、市價乃傾向下降有一部份意識、因共價値已臻高境、客銷一滯、反映驟起、但原棉未見鬆動、不過價昂、廠方不辦、二十支雙地球價爲六百三十五元、比上日猛跌一十元零五角云、</p>
<p>現紗晨開氣勢尙緊、因廣帮對於雙馬仍有小額子喫胃、開價漲三四兀、二十支雙馬外棧貨價爲七百七十七元、棧單價爲六百九十三元、少頃聞外滙放長、實需轉滯，籌碼一鬆、跌風陡起、浮多乘虚急於了結、二十支雙馬直落至七百六十四元、棧單價跌至六百七十七元、一霎間跌去十四五兀之譜、査半日間成交統計僅八百二十六包、行情二十支雙馬跌十一元、雙地球跌二十元零五角、惟收羊因根子緊迫而跌二元、又棉紗今日出口、有四十五件運往香港、二十件運往海防、另有布疋六件、亦運海防、十六件運往香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量如左、</p>
<p>午後消息、紗市仍趨衰弱、因浮多了結之念殊濃、二十支雙馬現出價爲七百六十元、比收盤價再跌四元光景、</p>
<h3>滙票鬆動　外棉交易活躍</h3>
<p>中外現棉交易　尙稱不弱、廠方進意平淡、蓋以紗市不振而下挫、惟同業心思異常俏利、因本埠存貨日見减削、且洋行定價仍昂、故有一部份手貨扳緊不售、目光看好、而外</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、昨日因歐局消息之傅來、滙兌轉鬆、因之同業又轉活躍、昨日成交者、計美棉五百件、價一百五十六元、巴西棉三百件、價一百七十元、</p>
<p>外棉布價、紐約棉布、昨日未見起色、晨初尙因利物浦來電良好、而略見上昇、乃因歐洲政局之突變、蘇德的定之訂立、人心惶惶、交易頗爲淸淡、惟南方套賣頗烈、空頭者因政局之變化莫測、故大部了結、因之市價下跌五六磅音、印度連同預測跌一羅比半、埃及跌數磅音、</p>
<p>印棉源源而來、慶誌前報、昨有大英公司鴨家船Jilawa號、由喀爾喀搭、裝來棉花八百件、於前日（二十一日）傍晚抵滬、停靠浦東其昌棧、業已起卸完竣、該輪運往日本之貨甚多、定今晨赴椗赴日、又聞英商保和洋行之Elmbank號、由日商山下公司承租、赴印度裝棉花、現已啟程來滬、的本月二十七日可到、所裝之棉花確數未悉、大的在五千噸之譜、屆時抵滬後、停靠浦東鴻興碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<h3>證劵　內債盤旋　外股有人脫售</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市况趨勢初無起色、依然盤旋狀况、市塲人氣仍屬疲軟、市價上落於一二角之間、故午前高低差額仍極微細、收盤後忽有謠傳德蘇於商的協定簽定之後、更將有互不侵犯協定之擬議、匯轉長、廠方心思稍定、訂價尙挺、仍屬劃算不通、華廠隻包未進、至於日廠僅大康廠進來實花一百件、且係九月份送廠交貨價、棉市前途、仍不脫徬徨之途也、蘇北來源父見增多、到通州花六百七十七包、茲將售盤情形錄左、人心驟遭刺激、國際間鈎心鬬角、愈演愈奇、但與中國儘屬有利、故僓市於暗盤後突又略起漲風、丙種又穿出四十一元、因大戶仍在觀望、故漲風仍未能有力、前途或許有好轉也、昨於初開時、同康永康相繼賣出、十五號求售允多、後經大豐聯益及十四號等買進、價乃稍堅、故結果祇有五分一角上落、且係高低互見、收市後人心受傳言之激動、補空突起、驟好六七角、後以臨時多頭稍有出籠、丙種衝出四十一元、後復又進關、人心尙未能一致也、市價結果高低互見、成交總數的計有八十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、類別最高最低收盤比前日</p>
<p>股票交易、成交閘北水電股一百股、價爲六元三角云、</p>
<p>又上海衆業公所報吿云、戰爭恐懼、籠罩市塲、有若干種股票、顯係在驚惶失措下售脫、如「可太把路」橡皮股、成交價竟低達三元、買方一度幾能有權命令買價、取捨自如、蓋無論何項低度買價、喊出後便有賣戶售予也、入後壓力稍止、市况略有回頭、際茲不安狀態下、市塲雖有利多因子、如倫敦橡皮存底、最近銳减三千五百噸、亦難免全被忽視矣、後此數日內之市塲行徑、仍須視政局發展趨勢而定、</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠東各公司股票、本月二十一日（週一）掛牌行市、一致下跌、麥加利銀行股跌五先令、價爲六鎊牛、匯豐銀行英倫註冊股跌三鎊半、價爲六十八鎊半、香港註冊股跌四鎊、價爲七十一鎊、開平煤礦股跌一先令、價爲十二先令六便士、古拉客林傍橡皮股跌三便士、價爲十七先令三便士、餘吿平穩不動、</p>
<p>倫敦中國外債、本月二十一日（週一）掛牌行市、仍吿平穩、行情均無變動、</p>
<h3>絲茶　生絲出口　首次遭遇阻礙</h3>
<p>昨日絲市、紐約近期跌三分半、遠期原盤、現貨日絲跌七分、上海絲跌六分、橫濱現貨跌三元、遠期跌二元，</p>
<p>本埠絲銷呆滯、大部原因、當係出口困難、進戶觀望、昨聞某洋行出口絲、已首次遭遇阻礙、絲業中人已深知今後危機、故咸衣示决不理睬、是以所謂「生絲檢驗所」者之辦法、勢將碰壁云、</p>
<h3>糖市洋糖略鬆</h3>
<p>昨糖市據外電略有回好、九月份收盤價爲荷盾七·〇〇、倫教電十二月份六先令、明年三月份六先令〇二五、六月份六先令一辦士、公會划盤二四粗白小三角、本棧貨四十元半、外棧四十元二角、轉口貨三十二元二角、太古車白稍有微鬆、東棧B嘜小二角、爲四十四元三角、西棧升一角、爲四十四元八角、其餘小一二角不一、H嘜車赤升五角、爲二十八元半、荷赤現貨初升半元、爲三十六元半、後又升三角爲三十六元八角、轉口貨前後升一元、初爲三十元、後達三元半、本一號白及本冰均乏更動、國糖僅開出冲提青數十包、價爲三十九元、</p>

<h3>上海一日　石庫門裏</h3>
<p>— 柳浪</p>
<p>晨起，讀報：</p>
<p>「……米店遭搶……滬西發生衝突……分幣券到滬……」</p>
<p>房門外有嘈雜的人聲。視綫被打擾着離開了報紙，耳膜里又印上了聽熟了的二房東的南北混合的口音：</p>
<p>「隨便你到那兒去找，也找不到像這里那樣便宜的房子。先生！十五元，在如今祇能算是十五個小錢，你說是不是？哈哈哈……眞的，要不是貪圖你們人少，我可眞不願意借哩！」</p>
<p>我們腦海里又交織起十五元和黑暗得沒有陽光沒有空氣的擱樓的影子，心里又盪溢起憎和恨來。</p>
<p>正想收集起紊亂的心緒，在報上去找剩餘的新聞時，步梯咚咚的響起來，那人在很急地跑，很耑氣的說：</p>
<p>「早筒開十六號！」</p>
<p>一聽這聲音，我早就知道他是後樓的房客。他，整天在鷄棚似的後樓上拿着一管鉛筆在手摺上寫，也時常有人跑到他的身邊，咕膿幾句，塞了一些東西給他，那些人又多半是年老的和年青的女人。他呢，祇是在淸晨，中飯時，晚飯時出去一决。起初，我不知他在幹些什麼？後來也就弄明白了，是一隻『航船』。</p>
<p>我的平靜給擾亂了。索性從床上爬起來，我也沒有打算過爬起來要做一些什麽？呆瞪瞪地坐着，祇讓後弄的種種小販的呌喊聲蕪亂地收集在耳朶里。</p>
<p>「苦——啊——」</p>
<p>是壓緊了喉嚨拖長了尾音的女人呌聲，從二層樓前樓傳過來。一個面目淸秀的女孩子映現在我的眼前了。她早晨起來吊嗓子，到了傍晚有一個滿面擦了脂粉的男不男女不女的戲敎師來敎她的戲。爲什麽要讓她學那些陳腐的戲呢？我也曾間過二房東——她的父親，回答是：</p>
<p>「女人家能够做些什麽呢？拾她大學讀畢了業，還不是沒有事情做。倒不如給她學戲，回頭有點小名氣，二三百元，六七百元，却並不是件難事。」</p>
<p>「又給不良的家敎毀了一個女孩子的生命！」我祇有道樣無助的喟嘆着。</p>
<p>一樓亭子間的京胡又饗啦！上午一次，下午一次，晚上一次，像做功課那麽似的拉着。這人在我看來，他是這石庫門里的天之驕子，除了拉胡琴，天天換了燙得畢挺的四裝，出去玩兒之外，我沒有看見過他有生活上的憂慮。我沒有招呼過他，不知道他是什麽樣的一個人，然而，我無理由地憎懨着他。</p>
<p>母親帶着不高興的神色從菜市回來了，她咕噥着：</p>
<p>「眞是豈有此理，我給他們郵票，他們嫌這樣那樣的不用。給了他們角票呢，找出來的還不是郵票！眞是，要不爲了吃，誰高興受這氣來？還有，還有那些黑良心的米店，把米價抬高到三十八元，照這樣下去，眞要活不成啦！」</p>
<p>母親把郵票擲到我的面前，我發現這裏面還有香烟贈券混在裏面，她史氣了。</p>
<p>這以後，就讓風爐裏的烟自霧籠罩在我的週身，一直到午飯吃過。</p>
<p>下午，三樓前樓開始熱鬧起來，那裹住着一個舞女，天天打扮得妖形怪狀的，天天下午有西裝少年來探望她，狎褻的笑聲，呌人聽了難受。</p>
<p>我也常常把這倘舞女和客堂裹　綫廠的女工，和後客堂的「野鷄」放在一起聯想着。女工，一天到晚的做，頂好的也祇有五毛錢一天，她們說：「每天一人的伙食倒要四毛錢哩！」而後客堂的「野鷄」，早七起來洗衣服，午飯後出去趕早市，深夜的低聲的哭泣又是常常可以聽到的。比起來，那個舞女是舒服些了。其實這是外形的比較，那舞女有着一個抽大燜的媽，也時常因爲缺少錢而被痛駡的。她們，是一樣苦難的女人啊！</p>
<p>我討厭這一幢石庫門，但，我沒有力量沒有勇氣搬家。於是。我整天的悶在這幢石庫門裹，從早上起來，一直到晚上十二點二房東關熄電火的總門。</p>
<h3>分幣券發行的前夜</h3>
<p>— 素臣</p>
<p>自從銅幣被奸商收買，以致市面上利用郵票來代替通行以來，煩麻果不必細說，而因之發生的糾紛，可以說得無日無之。於是，每一個市民都盼望着分幣券的早日發行。</p>
<p>前天的報上告訴了我們這個喜訉了：分幣券定二十二日發行，有的報上還印出了銅圖。可是在這喜訊到來之前，又不幸發生了混亂的現象，待筆者把前咋二天所見到的情形報吿於後：</p>
<p>關於四十萬元郵票的處置間題，市商會所建議的三點，除第一條沒有問題外，據昨天報上的消息，第二·三兩條，是「越出郵局業務範圍，無考慮之餘地，」換句話說，要郵局收回是不可能了。但是現在的商店，住戶，小販等手中的郵票，都積存不少，作爲寄信用，事實上是用不了這許多；而小販商人的少數資金更爲了郵票的不易脫手，影響了他們的賣買，不，生計問題！現在聽到分幣券即將發行，自然是如大旱之望雲霓，但是跟着血來的是在將發行前夜的過渡時期，又形成了混亂的現象。</p>
<p>大家知道分幣券發行以後，存在手中的郵票要擱淺了，然而生意是要做的，於是一切買賣整數交易，如南貨店，小菜塲，什麽東西都要一毛錢起賣，實在沒有辦法而有零數的時候，他們倒願意收受電車公司發行的代價券，因爲這代價劵是可以兌換現金的。至於每條街上的豆腐攤，大餅攤等，然不能也掛着零數不售的牌子，他們電車公司的代價劵是要的，關於尾數都以臨時蓋一個本店圖章的紙張為憑，等分幣券發行後負責收回。這樣一來，手續上的麻煩不必說，無形中又提高了生活程度。</p>
<p>本來，這是過波時期應有的現象，一二天的損失總能忍受的，可是分幣劵因手續不及，又展期發行了。這展期的時日是長是短，報上語焉不詳。一方面郵票已不能通用，分幣券又展期，在這延長的過渡時期中，如這兩天的混亂情形擴展下去，確是可憂的！</p>
<p>所以，我們向郵政當局再作一個最後的請求，就是完整的，淸潔的，應特別體恤一般市民，准允收回，或者更限定一個每人兌換的數目，因爲使小販商人安定生活是目前最重要的一件事呀！</p>
<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十五回　海外豓聞忽迎桃葉　火中奇景竟粲蓮花</p>
<p>但是白種人從前對於有色人種的痼見甚深，他們以爲東方人的文化，無論如何，終不及西方人。譬如像成功那樣的一位青年，學校中的敎師們，也都稱贊他。考試起來，也許成績是比白種的子弟爲優。然而他們的成見，却只是可惜成功不是歐美人而却是個中國人。所以愛鹿絲雖與成功日漸親熱，她的家長與親戚中，到底不願愛麗絲嫁一個中國人。愛鹿絲有位姑母，是篤信天主敎而守貞不嫁的老處女，她是有些守舊而頑固的。她竟敎愛麗絲的母親，强制執行，不許再與成功往來。這時愛鹿絲與成功的愛情，已漸漸地生了根，好像兩人有幾大不見，便要懐念，愛麗絲覺得眞是弄假成眞了。有一天，她的姑母，用了說敎的態度，要來說服愛麗絲，勸她不要去嫁中國人。她把中國人的壊處，都搜集攏來，作爲她的材料了。他說：「中國人是要纏小脚的，即使你自己，他們總不至於再敎你纏脚。你將來生下個女孩子來，他們要强迫給她纏脚，你就捨得將個可愛的嬌娃，生生地把她兩脚成了這個肢體傷殘的畸形嗎？」她說：「中國人的家長是十分尊嚴的，一個做兒媳婦的，對於翁姑是要叩頭的。現在那位姓成的中國孩子，聽說父親沒有了，母親却還在，中國人是大家族制度，尊長是很多的，你將來跟他到中國去，見了他們的尊長，一個一個，都要向他們叩頭嗎？」她說：「中國人是多妻制度，三妻四妾，不足爲奇，你到了中國去，是孤立無援，又入了中國籍，祖國也不能再保護你。到了那個常兒，你的男人，戀新棄舊，把你丢在腦後，你有什麼方法想？一生的幸福，不是白白地犧牲了嗎？」她說：「中國人的婚姻制度，男人死了，女子不能再嫁人，要給他守節，一直守到死。倘然女人死了，男子在一個月裏，便可以和別個女人結婚，沒有人說他是薄情。這是中國的法律人情，都規定了的，你覺能忍受這樣的男女不平等嗎？』此外她又嘮嘮叨叨，說了許多使人難堪的話。總結一句話，緣了一個中國人，一個女子的幸福完了。天下愚蠢之事，莫有過於此者！（一七二）</p>
<p>生活報吿</p>
<h3>鎖眼</h3>
<p>— 許由</p>
<p>在普通的西裝成衣舖裏，他們租了一間狹小的店面以後，就把炷間劃開來做鎖鈕間，裹面須擁有十個到二十個的鎖鈕眼的女工。</p>
<p>這裏是永遠見不到陽光的，一天到晚點着一盞五枝光的電燈。這班鎖鈕眼的女工就在這微弱的燈光下，鎖着那種藏青色的小鈕眼。潮濕，黑暗，難聞的臭氣，再加上震耳的機聲，初去的人，一踏進這裏，便會感覺到暈船一般的難過。</p>
<p>公司承接的多半是大衣，橡雨衣，最多是學校的制服，她們天天都是一針一綫的拉着縫着。</p>
<p>一套中山裝共有三十一顆鈕子，每天最多鎖四套，每套的工資是一角。一套雨衣有八顆鈕子，而工資只有五分。工裝有十顆鈕子，工資却仍楚五分。你就死力的做，每天頂多不過賺四角大洋，還要目己出綫錢。</p>
<p>別人也許以為這種拈針的生活，輕便不吃力，然而當你做上了三個鐘頭以後，就要頭昏眼花。</p>
<p>鎖得稍為不好，檢查出來，就要拆掉再鎖，鈕眼一經拆過，紗頭都要鬆散了，軍做的工夫，比第一决要吃力一倍呢。</p>
<p>成衣店的工作，是有季候的，忙的時候累得連氣都不能透，一天要做十四五個鐘頭，做得頭昏眼花，腦袋好像重了幾十斤斤計較　空的時候呢，一禮拜只有一二天好做，甚至七天都要在家裏吃白飯。</p>

<p>藝人漫記</p>
<h3>演劇經驗之一端（上）</h3>
<p>— 孫敏</p>
<p>談反派戲與正派戲難易問題</p>
<p>編者介紹：孫敬致力影業極早，也記影壇上資格很老，演片特多，當於演劇經驗的一員健將。往時雅譽廣擴，競稱爲「風流小生」：近年自改演反派角已以後，則又變作一位眾口唾罵的銀幕惡徒了。像他這樣正反派戲，兼擅並妙，可說是其過人之長；而本文此立論，全屬經驗之談，亦復極饒情味。</p>
<p>國片事業當在開然萌芽時期，我就投進了這荒蕪的藝園，當起一位忠實的勞工。最先，從肄業於中華電影學校，而加入神州公司，拍戲近三年起，歷轉「大中華」年，「長城」兩年，「天一」四五年，「明星」四年多，以至今春應邀「新華」爲止，拍過的片子，計已不下百部之多，就經驗說來，似亦不弱於人，但在成績方面，自己總覺徒擁虛名，並沒怎樣較滿意的作品。</p>
<p>以前，專演正派角色，向來是被稱爲「風流小生」的。國片作派在前五六年，未經轉變到注魚意識之前，除了所謂武俠戲外，演小生戲全部生在所謂「　度翩翩」的形式，根本上便沒有硬派般與軟派戲的差別。後來這上面有了新的覺悟，自已亦即跟著時代轉變了。</p>
<p>我從慣演正派戲而突然改演反派角色，是起端於六年前加入「明星」的時候：常時，多半也爲屬於新人物之類的反派小生極感缺乏，幾位導演人都認爲我在演戲經驗上，夠得應付而才由我來承乏的。經此改變作派，承他們多多　讚之下，也就不再容我重演正派戲了。一直到現在，我竟純被動的就此成爲了專演反派戲的角色</p>
<p>反派與正派看似同樣演戲，我在經驗上却有很多不同的感覺：實在，反派戲比較正派戲難做得多，而事實上的情形，不但吃力不易討好，一般的目光，且又多將反派角色的地位，看得反較正派爲低。就此衡量一下，演反派戲是確屬吃虧太多了。</p>
<h3>譚李德彬</h3>
<p>— 正宇</p>
<p>宋德珠劇團之小生</p>
<p>黃金大戲院秋涼後首批　角，已邀妥宋德珠及楊　森二人，宋楊二人，余嘗爲文記之本報，關於德珠之配角，未曾言及，德珠配角，已邀妥不致有所變動者，有小生李德彬，武淨簫德寅，小丑艾世菊，武戲下把佟德新等，此中徐世菊巳爲滬人熟知，毋庸介紹，德寅另文誌之外，茲所謂者，即小生李德彬是也。</p>
<p>德彬原名志斌，父早歿，故與母寄居於外祖家，賴舅父撫養，得以成人，幼時曾於小學中攻讀，到民國三十年始考入戲曲學校，校方因其丰姿都美，性情溫雅，令其從老伶工馮惠林習小生劇，開蒙戲爲「轅鬥射戟」，後復經名票包丹庭指導，能　不不百餘　，而尤以雉尼爲最佳，如「八大鎚」，「雅觀樓」「翠英會」，「黃鶴樓」等皆爲傑作也，最近即將隨德珠南來，獻其藝術於吾人之前，值此小生人材缺乏之際，以德彬之文武全材，來滬走紅，意中事也。</p>
<h3>訪問舞聯社</h3>
<p>— 木子</p>
<p>（一）動機</p>
<p>今年的六月尾，舞聯社像孩子離開母親的懷抱，開始學步。初秋，他更活潑了。我要去訪問一次「舞聯社」，想替時代浪潮泛濫下的苦姊妹們記些歡笑或苦味。</p>
<p>（二）可怕又可愛的姑娘？未進舞聯的大門，首先憶念起一句話來，這是二年前個會說俏皮話的朋友告訴我的：「這是一　可怕又可愛的姑娘呢！」……淮門後只見天藍色的一片，未待細看，裏面已走出一位僕素含笑的姑娘了，她向我我深深地一鞠蛤，以一種鈴聳般清脆的　柔口氣間詢我：「先生找那一位？」</p>
<p>經過說明來意之後，她表示歡迎，就引導我入內室去參觀：裏面坐著閱書的幾位小姐站起來對我呆看，那位領導參觀的小姐，就一一替我介紹，她們却都穿著土布</p>
<p>（三）踏上了光明的大道</p>
<p>內室的璧間，除正中按置著一座鋼琴外，最能引起人注目的，該是許多名流先生們的題詞吧，袁老先生題的龍「自力更生」康侯先生則以蒼老的字體寫著「行有餘力則以學問」。在這裹，還設置閱報處和借書部；音樂處和會客處是連系的。內室與外室僅隔了座月洞門，這種設計是夠巧妙與美親的，拿一片天藍色來陪襯，就更易使人起著一陣幽靜的愉快。在辦公處的正中，是一塊很大的通告牌，所有通告上的字句，都以白話或更俗的字句來寫成。從外室望到內室，在月洞里父可清楚的看見一副很長的對聯：「踏上了光明的大道，捧出那純潔底良心」，這字句多末深遠啊。</p>
<p>（四）從今後決不用自殺的手段來結束有用的生命。</p>
<p>在參觀中曾跟那樸素含笑的姑娘談了許多話，但我終不敢請教她的姓名，因爲在我的理解中，我是來訪問「社」決不是來認識「人」的，然而「人」也終於認識了，這是那姑娘最後的幾句話，也是我對這一　第一次真正的感動，她說到激動時我怕她會流下眼淚來了，她是在以打戰的聲音一字一字的吐著：「先生，我們是人，我們同樣是有靈魂且願意向上的女性，我們要更努力去喚醒自己的姊珠，從今後決不用自殺的手段來結束自己有用的生命！」</p>

<p>最近倫敦有一所著名電影院——溫赫戲院採用了一種新發明，可以使聲子聽得到有要影片發出的聲音。</p>
<p>這種新發明的裝置，係用放大器連接一傳聲器，裝於銀幕後的發音機上，然後用地下電線（置於地毯下）接在特設的座位上，當影片開映時，因感應電流之關係，將聲音傳達給聲子的耳鼓專，異常消晰，使聾子們聽到幕上直接發音的對白和歌唱。這種新發明的裝置，使溫赫戲院的生意好了不少。</p>

<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>剃頭與拔毛爲伶人兩大苦事</p>
<p>西人常以冷水洗頭，意示術生，然國人剃頭之習慣，必先用開水燙洗，而後剃之，偶一爲之，猶無大害，若淨行竟每日非如此不可，其痛苦與不合乎衛生殆莫甚於此焉。以前戲班的後　裏，常好偏用著一兩位剃頭師務，忙著替淨行人作洗剃的工作，現在有了保險剃刀，並且大角兒都　用著夥計跟包，這些日常應有的差事，多由此聾人代勞了。不過有些戲館子裹，還照舊用著理發匠人。</p>
<p>以男扮女，這是中國舞臺上特有的情形，不過男子一到二十歲以外，　鬚就自然而然的生長出來。況且這樣東西越是討厭它，越是長得快，愈是剃得勤，愈是硬而黑，一到三十以外，那簡直就無法制止了。試想唱旦角的全憑臉子嬌嫩，皮膚白哲，始能受人歡迎，倘是鬍鬚長得太密太旺，縱令天天可以用刀剃光一次，但是烏黑的鬚雜子上面擦起粉來，變成深青的顏色，正合俗語所謂「茄子上面抹石灰，」實在是太減色了。倘使年紀大的正工青衣，偶爾串演－次，如陳德霖、吳彩霞、等，臺下倒遝可以特別原諒，因爲專在他們的唱、作、工夫上深切注意，早把色的問題拋在一邊。要像梅、程、荀、尚四大名旦及其他的男旦方面，似乎觀眾的心理還離不開個色的問題，於始「扮相」的漂亮與否，大家就不得不常在口頸上討論一番了。（八六）</p>

<h3>Major Shift in the International Landscape: Soviet Union and Germany Sign Non-Aggression Pact; German Foreign Minister to Fly to Moscow Today for Signing; Anti-Comintern Pact Bankrupt, Where Does Japan Go?</h3>
<p>Moscow – Following the conclusion of a commercial credit agreement between the Soviet Union and Germany, the issue of improving Soviet-German political relations has arisen. As a result of the exchange of views between the two governments on this matter, it has been determined that both sides are willing to ease tensions in political relations, thereby eliminating the crisis of war and concluding a non-aggression pact. Therefore, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will arrive in Moscow within days to conduct the necessary negotiations. (TASS dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin – Huitong News Agency has learned from authoritative sources that Germany and the Soviet Union have agreed to sign a non-aggression pact. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is scheduled to fly to Moscow on August 23, accompanied by Gaus, Director of the Legal Department of the Foreign Ministry, Counselor Wiehe, Director of the Intelligence Department Schmidt, and the famous translator Schmidt-Bellemer, among others. (Meitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin – Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, accompanied by 32 staff members, took a plane to Anisburg in East Prussia at noon today and will transfer to Moscow tomorrow morning. Political figures here claim that all issues have been resolved through diplomatic channels, and once Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrives in Moscow, the treaty will be completed quickly. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin – The news that Germany and the Soviet Union will sign a non-aggression pact came suddenly. All sectors of the Japanese community here were completely unprepared for this move by the two countries. Upon learning of it, they seemed extremely dismayed, all saying that the anti-communist public purpose is now of no value. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin – Japanese people here are very surprised to hear that Germany and the Soviet Union have agreed to a non-aggression pact. Japanese Ambassador Oshima has strongly advocated joining the German-Italian alliance. He convened a meeting of key embassy staff at midnight yesterday and afterwards sent a long telegram to the Tokyo embassy expressing great concern about the future fate of the Anti-Comintern Pact. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo – At this morning's cabinet meeting, the Soviet-German non-aggression pact and the Anglo-Japanese talks were discussed. Foreign Minister Arita said that the Anglo-Japanese talks had effectively broken down, but the Japanese government would decide its attitude after ascertaining Britain's true intentions. Arita also informed the cabinet members of the information regarding the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, saying that the information was not yet complete. The cabinet members then exchanged views on the new situation in Europe, but made no decision. The Ministry of the Army had not received official information and did not wish to express an opinion. However, all sectors of the army are now paying serious attention to this new move by Germany and the Soviet Union. This morning, administrative personnel of the Ministry of the Army held a meeting. The Ministry of the Army will issue a statement after receiving official information, explaining the army's attitude towards the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The official reports on the Soviet-German non-aggression pact from Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima and Ambassador to Italy Shiratori were delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 3:00 PM today. Foreign Minister Arita immediately visited Prime Minister Hiranuma at his residence at 3:30 PM, and they talked until 4:20 PM, holding a meeting to discuss Japan's plan to deal with this new situation. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo – According to critics here, Japan has received a painful lesson in any case: the spiritual constraint of the anti-communist public purpose has no force in Hitler's realistic policy. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Paris – The officialdom here was very surprised to learn that Germany and the Soviet Union were about to conclude a non-aggression pact. They all said that after the Soviet Union's western border was guaranteed, it would be free to act in the Far East, indicating that Japan had been sacrificed by its European allies. As for the ongoing negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, they would inevitably be profoundly affected. Although the security system created by Britain and France would be hindered as a result, the ideological viewpoint of the German-Italian axis was also overturned. Germany's occupation of Bohemia and Moravia violated the racial doctrines of National Socialism. From now on, the principle of the anti-communist crusade no longer exists. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>British and French Authorities Extremely Surprised and Panicked; Consider It a Major Blow to the Peace Front; British Parliament to Reconvene Tomorrow</h3>
<p>London – Key figures here today not only expressed surprise but also panic at the news that Germany and the Soviet Union would sign a non-aggression pact, calling it a major blow to the British peace front. It is generally believed that the Soviet government, having negotiated with Britain and France for months without effect, has become impatient and is taking its final move. If the Western powers still do not accept its conditions, the Soviet Union is prepared to abandon them and allow Germany to achieve its ambitions in Poland. If necessary, Germany could extend its influence over the Balkan countries that have rejected Soviet military aid. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>London – Officialdom here has not yet commented on the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. All newspapers and non-officialdom have expressed surprise at the news. The Daily Mail said that if this is true, then the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact and the Axis anti-Comintern Pact are both invalid. The Daily Herald said that today's event directly encourages Germany to continue its actions against Poland. In other words, the Soviet Union is inviting Germany to do what it wants. Britain should convene Parliament immediately. The key to war and peace will be decided within days. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>London – After strong requests from the opposition parties in both the House of Lords and the House of Commons, both houses are very likely to reconvene on Thursday. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Paris – Unofficial circles were greatly shocked by the announcement that Germany and the Soviet Union had agreed to conclude a non-aggression pact. Officialdom has not yet commented on this. It is widely believed that one of the key figures behind this agreement must be the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Paris – Regarding the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, people in the Foreign Ministry here are all taciturn, saying only that the two countries concluded the Treaty of Rapallo on April 16, 1922, which has not yet been repealed. Their current relationship still has significant changes due to this treaty. German newspapers are currently making a big deal of it, indicating that the authorities there attach great importance to this matter psychologically. Observers analyzing the current situation said that the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Britain and France were progressing slowly, so they induced Germany to provide guarantees that were even more advanced than what Britain and France could provide. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Holds Meeting</h3>
<p>London – The international situation continues to deteriorate, so today's cabinet meeting has been changed to a full cabinet meeting. The outcome is now of great concern to the British public. London officialdom believes that the British government's attitude remains completely unchanged, calm and strong, as before. Among the events to be considered by cabinet members today is a "declaration should be reissued by the British government, reiterating its attitude towards any act of aggression." However, the general opinion is that the British government's previous declarations on this matter have been extremely clear, and there seems to be no need for a new statement. Furthermore, it is not appropriate to stir up emotions with unnecessary remarks. However, cabinet members will review what they have seen and take the steps they deem necessary. The cabinet meeting is scheduled to be held this afternoon, so Prime Minister Chamberlain has the opportunity to meet with cabinet members in the morning to discuss matters with each other. Reuters diplomatic reporters have heard from officialdom that the Axis powers are certain that Britain and France are determined that if Poland conflicts with Germany because its independence is threatened, then Britain and France will back Poland. This cannot be answered by London, but the attitude of a democratic country, which should be understood by the Axis powers, goes without saying. It is generally acknowledged here that the British government has used correct and clear words to the best of its ability to explain its attitude and obligations, in order to safeguard peace. British Foreign Secretary Halifax stated on June 27, "In the event that further acts of aggression occur, we are determined to immediately use all our strength to fulfill our promise to resist aggression." Prime Minister Chamberlain later firmly stated that the Foreign Secretary's remarks represent the British government's considered policy. At today's meeting, cabinet members will study whether there are other ways, in addition to what the government has already done, to ensure that no one has any doubts about the meaning of the above promise. As everyone knows, any effort to distort Britain's attitude is a common trick, aimed at undermining trust in democratic countries and having a negative impact on neutral countries. Whether to convene the British Parliament may also be a question that cabinet members need to consider today. Before the regular session of Parliament adjourned, Chamberlain assured the House of Commons that if there were developments in the situation that warranted the convening of Parliament, the government would convene Parliament before the date of the resumption of Parliament on October 3. But Chamberlain also refused to advocate convening a special session of Parliament on August 22 at that time, so today the Prime Minister and other cabinet members may still believe that the convening of Parliament is not yet necessary or is not yet the time. The leader of the opposition party in the House of Commons, Greenwood, visited Chamberlain at Downing Street yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japan Suffers Triple Blow</h3>
<p>London – Chinese officials and non-officials here have expressed satisfaction with the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, as this move allows the Soviet Union to have no worries about its western border and is free to deal with everything in the Far East. According to Chinese sources, since the United States announced the abolition of trade with Japan, and Britain refused to discuss the issue of Chinese legal tender and silver deposits in Tianjin, now there is the conclusion of this agreement, which has caused Japan to suffer a triple failure and has to change its entire policy. Japanese officials here are all keeping silent. The Japanese business community was already unhappy with the advocacy of joining the Axis by Japanese extremists, now saying that German propaganda in Japan has been completely successful so far. It began by guiding public sentiment to resist the Soviet Union, and then in recent months shifted its target to concentrate public sentiment against Britain. Now that Germany and the Soviet Union have concluded a non-aggression pact, Japan should understand that Germany's words and actions do not match, or it may return to its former mood and become more friendly with Britain, which is also possible. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin – Regarding the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, observers here said that Germany had notified Italy in advance, but not Japan. Officials did not want to comment on the fate of the Anti-Comintern Pact, only stating that the pact was based on ideology, while the non-aggression pact was political in nature, and that it did not interfere with the obligations that Germany and the Soviet Union had accepted towards third countries.

<h3>Turning Enemies into Friends: German Newspapers Report Extensively; Hailing It as a Great Success; Germans Bewildered</h3>
<p>Berlin – People in Berlin were greatly surprised to see the news in the morning newspapers that Germany and the Soviet Union were about to conclude a non-aggression pact. The two countries, National Socialist Germany and Bolshevik Russia, with their vastly different ideologies, suddenly changed their relationship overnight, which was truly unexpected. German newspapers all published the news with extremely large headlines. The National Socialist Party's organ newspaper printed two eight-inch long red-letter headlines on the entire front page. However, the newspapers did not write a single word of commentary. Readers were bewildered, not knowing what path Germany would take. The negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union were conducted in great secrecy, and almost no one knew about them except for a few top officials. Even government spokesmen expressed great surprise. People in foreign political circles in Berlin regarded this as a great success for Germany, which would completely change the European political situation, and regarded it as the starting point for more important developments. The world is now watching with great interest how this move by Germany will affect Germany's relations with Spain and Japan. It is expected that Japan will be very disappointed with the rapprochement between Germany and the Soviet Union, as Japan has undoubtedly relied on its closer relationship with Germany in order to be detrimental to the Soviet Union. German political circles are very pleased with this agreement, saying that this matter was unexpected by the Allied countries. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact</h3>
<p>The imminent signing of a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany is an unexpected piece of news in the newspapers, an unexpected change in the international situation, and an unexpected lesson for politicians.</p>
<p>To elaborate on this matter, we must first clearly understand the outline of the event. According to a Berlin dispatch from the German National News Agency Huitong News Agency yesterday, August 22: Germany and the Soviet Union have agreed to sign a non-aggression agreement, and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is scheduled to fly to Moscow on the 23rd, accompanied by his subordinates, the directors of the Legal Department and the Propaganda Department. According to a Moscow dispatch from the Soviet National News Agency TASS yesterday: As a result of the exchange of views between the Soviet Union and Germany, it has been determined that both sides are willing to ease the tense situation in political relations in order to eliminate the war crisis and conclude a non-aggression agreement. The German Foreign Minister will arrive in Moscow within days to conduct the necessary negotiations. The two countries and the two news agencies each issued dispatches from their respective capitals, each with its own details, but the main points were the same. In short, both sides expressed a strong desire to sign a non-aggression pact, but it remains to be negotiated and has not yet been established.</p>
<p>At this point before it has been established, it should be regarded as a matter of both success and failure, until the end of the negotiations. The so-called non-aggression pact can have any content, that is, problems can arise in the clauses. The location of the problem is not necessarily harmonious. Let's raise a doubt: Is aggression towards us narrowly defined, or broadly defined? If the aggression does not extend to the homeland of the signatory country, but in addition to the homeland, there are so-called neighboring countries that are vital to survival, can they also be aggressed against? If a neighbor vital to survival is seized without force, can it not be called aggression? The negotiations between the Soviet Union and Britain and France took the issue of guaranteeing the security of the three Baltic states as one setback, and the definition of indirect aggression as another setback, because the Soviet Union regards the three countries as vital to the Soviet Union's survival. How is the Soviet Union striving for it with Britain and France, and how is it compromising with Germany? This newspaper once said, "The Soviet Union handles all issues meticulously." Compromising with Germany is impossible. Therefore, the future of the Soviet-German negotiations should not be regarded as without problems.</p>
<p>However, we would rather judge from various perspectives that the Soviet and German negotiations to conclude a non-aggression pact will be concluded. In other words: Although there are various internal and external difficulties in the negotiations between the two countries, the non-aggression pact that both sides are eager to conclude will not only not be aborted due to difficulties, but also will not be a difficult birth, but will be completed quickly. Now there is no time to elaborate on the basis of our judgment, so let's assume that the judgment is not wrong, take it as a basis and elaborate on it.</p>
<p>After the Soviet Union and Germany formally sign the non-aggression pact, at least since the last year (?), everything related to the international community: the foreign policies of various countries, military standards, the division of friends and enemies, the debate on doctrines: whether it is a public fact form, a plan to work hard with one's head buried, a contest of strategy and retreat, or a thunderstorm of propaganda and agitation; none of them do not need to be re-evaluated, re-considered; and even must start anew and be thoroughly changed. To analyze it in detail, words cannot express it. Indeed, the nature of the non-aggression pact seems to be passive prevention rather than active action. The protagonists now seem to be only the Soviet Union and Germany, and have nothing to do with other countries, but the impact will be so great that even the most restrained will no longer be able to pretend to be calm.</p>
<p>What is the impact? Taking the protagonist of the signing as an example: On the Soviet side, with National Socialist Germany, their very nature as founding nations makes them like water and fire, and Germany is the center of the Anti-Comintern Pact, which has led to a very sharp confrontation between the two countries. Now that the non-aggression pact has been concluded, it is like water and fire in different vessels, each with its own merits. This is its meaning. Although it is regarded as mutual recognition and respect for each other's doctrines, and mutual understanding and security in essence: this is one point. The two countries are in confrontation. Germany has always expressed no compromise with the Soviet Union, and Germany's aggressive policy is allowed to show people at any time and place that it will try its edge, which is deeply unsettling for the Soviet Union. Therefore, there is first a mutual assistance pact with France, and then discussions with Britain and France on mutual assistance methods. In short, the Soviet Union feels that it cannot be without friends and cannot be isolated from the whirlpool of the European situation. Now that the non-aggression pact has been concluded, the Soviet Union has not only no enemies in Europe, but has also crossed its only trench and shook hands with the enemy: this is the second point. The Soviet Union spans both Europe and Asia, and Germany and Japan have long been allied, appearing to strangle its eastern and western ends. Now that the non-aggression pact has been concluded, the Soviet Union no longer has to worry about its western border. Whether the Soviet Union will then take action in the Far East is another question, but from now on it has the possibility of acting freely and the possibility of acting with full force: this is the third point.</p>
<p>On the German side, since Hitler became the leader, he has been strengthening the military and preparing for war, and has no regard for Eastern and Central Europe. Even for Western Europe, it is dismissed. Only the Soviet Union is not only incompatible in terms of national ideology, but also the only strong enemy in terms of military strength and strategy. Judging from the speeches of the leader Hitler, his arrogance is boundless, but he has long ceased to attack communism, which shows his great concern. When Czechoslovakia was conquered, Britain and France became determined to show their strength, and Moscow was sought after by Britain and France. If the Soviet Union readily accepted the wishes of Britain and France and formed a strong and capable group, even if Germany wanted to leap forward, it would not be able to break through the grasp of those who "surrounded" it. The fatal wound of the aggressive policy is also the death knell of the National Socialist regime, which Hitler was very angry about. Now it has concluded a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, the meaning of which is not that Germany has gained a close friend or that aggression has gained an accomplice, but directly that the Soviet Union is no longer Germany's enemy, and indirectly that the Soviet Union no longer helps Britain and France to be enemies. Since Hitler took control of German politics, this is an unprecedented diplomatic success.</p>
<p>The important key points of this influence on the international situation are two: (1) The content of the non-aggression pact will almost certainly stipulate something about the survival and abolition of the treaty. If it is stipulated that one party to the signing country has any aggressive behavior towards a third country, the other party to the signing country may declare the abolition of the treaty. If so, the international situation will indirectly gain considerable stabilizing force. (2) After signing this treaty, how does Germany intend to think? What is its spirit? How will it act? Under the tacit understanding of the Soviet Union, what path and method will it take to implement its wishes? Everything is unpredictable. These two key points all depend on the German side. In addition to these two, study its impact individually. Germany has its heart set on Danzig, and will certainly not abandon its desire for Danzig as the price for obtaining the Soviet Union's signing of a non-aggression pact. Moreover, in terms of Danzig's geography and history, and in terms of its economy and bloodline, Poland will inevitably find it difficult to hold Danzig for long. But it is not only Danzig that has become a problem. Therefore, the impact of the establishment of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact will be closest and most significant to Poland, which will be in distress, confusion, and even sorrow. Germany, Italy, and Japan are known as allies, Germany and Italy are real, and Germany and Japan are false. It is true that they echo each other in diplomacy, and it is false that they jointly oppose communism in belief. Japan is unwilling to vigorously assist Germany and Italy in the European situation, and Germany and Italy are unwilling to sacrifice the market in the Far East. Japan wants to swallow China alone, and Germany and Italy have no old grievances against China. However, Japan believes that Germany and Italy are happy to be used, and that anti-communism can be used as a slogan. Therefore, the international situation has been brewing and evolving to another level, and Japan is still clinging to the past, still believing that the anti-communist public purpose is necessary and has a wonderful use. How could it know that Germany has removed the anti-communist banner, asked Italy for its consent, and is negotiating a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. Japan is still in the drum, still outside the door! Therefore, how Japan will deal with itself in the future is another question, but the fact that the international community proves that it is isolated is undeniable. As for Britain and France, after gaining this great lesson, they must have a profound understanding. They have been pursuing the Soviet Union for half a year, hoping to make it their ally in politics and military affairs. When the Soviet Union was uneasy about Germany's aggressive arrogance, they were not unmoved. Now that the Soviet Union and Germany have each gotten what they wanted, the efforts of Britain and France have failed. It is truly no different from being in love, then unrequited love, and then broken-hearted. Diplomatically speaking, Britain and France have failed greatly, but the negotiations between Britain and France and the Soviet Union have not been abandoned halfway because of this, and the achievements obtained in the future will be at least equal to the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union. Moreover, Britain and France's national strength and prestige can only be insulted by themselves, and cannot be easily insulted by others. Therefore, although Britain and France have suffered a regrettable setback, they have actually not been weakened at all.</p>
<h3>German Side Expects Important Negotiations Among Nations, Seeking a Comprehensive Solution to the Eastern European Problem, Germany and Poland Still Engaging in Military Preparations</h3>
<p>Berlin: It is generally said here that major countries' governments and politicians will conduct extremely important negotiations in the near future, and international affairs will therefore have decisive developments. The people, upon hearing the news, feel a sense of relief, believing that the current crisis can be peacefully resolved. Those in charge also predict that the Danzig issue can be quickly advanced. It is also said that what Germany is demanding includes not only the city of Danzig, but also any place within Poland where a majority of Germans reside, such as the Polish Corridor, Poznan Province, and Upper Silesia. Some say that the Germans in these areas can be exchanged for Poles within Germany. It is understood that Germany's hope is to greatly transform Eastern Europe politically, not just to resolve outstanding issues with Poland. However, some say that Germany's prestige and destiny are in a dangerous stalemate, and that the non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet Union provides a glorious way out. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Well-informed sources here claim that the situation is increasingly tense, and there may be shocking developments by the end of this week. Polish newspapers are more cautious in their pronouncements compared to Germany's intense propaganda. The "Polska" newspaper's Berlin dispatch states that Hitler's speech in Tannenberg on August 27th will be astonishing. However, it is not yet known whether his words are an excessive response to Poland's memorandum of May 5th, or whether they will destroy all channels of communication, causing the situation to reach extreme tension. However, judging from Hitler's psychology, the latter is more likely. The "Wieczór Warszawy" newspaper said that Hitler previously made very unpopular moves on the issue of Italian immigrants in Tyrol. He could now take some action to win back people's hearts, namely, to abandon the idea of war. However, in any case, Poland must prepare for all eventualities. For this reason, Poland and its allies are prepared. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: The tense atmosphere here seems to be increasing. People generally believe that new developments will occur soon. General Göring, the Air Force Minister's mouthpiece, "National-Zeitung," commenting on the Anglo-Polish treaty, said that this matter, like other important issues, will be decided this week. Political circles also believe this, saying that Polish atrocities cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely. At the same time, according to reliable sources, Germany's trial mobilization is progressing rapidly. The gathering of nurses, the organization of propaganda teams, the inoculation of soldiers, and the requisitioning of vehicles are actively underway. However, the shortage of automobiles is worse than before. Cologne and other towns in the Rhine region have begun three-night blackouts. Berlin officials are extremely secretive about everything and offer no opinions. However, German political circles still claim to be optimistic, but cannot explain the reasons for their optimism. Many people believe that Britain will not go to war over the Danzig issue. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to news received here last night, the tense situation on the German-Polish border is becoming increasingly dangerous. Germans fleeing from Poland are forming large groups. In the past two days, more than two thousand Germans have fled. Poland is increasingly engaged in military construction in various locations. Machine-gun positions and trenches have been set up in the Tczew area. Roads near Świecie have been reinforced with steel-reinforced concrete military obstacles. Reinforcements have been sent to the border areas, from Debrzno to Szczytno. The highway bridge from Poland to Moravia has been completely destroyed. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: The long-distance telephone line between Berlin and Warsaw was suddenly cut off last night. According to the Berlin telephone bureau, this was because the Polish side cut the cables. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Danzig: The authorities in this city are actively making military preparations and are rushing to build defensive fortifications along the Polish border. Even on Sundays, work continues as usual. Anti-aircraft guns have been installed along the coast, and barbed wire has been placed around the city. The city authorities have also requisitioned civilian trucks. The situation is tense, and rumors are rampant. It is said that this city will soon be incorporated into Germany. The general population is extremely anxious. The Nazi Party has repeatedly stated that Poland will encounter decisive setbacks in the next few days, and that Germany's goals will be achieved as predicted. However, there are conflicting rumors about what steps Germany will take. Some say that all Polish customs officials at the city's customs office will be expelled. Others say that the city authorities will take over the city's railway lines, which are the property of the Polish government. However, Polish people here remain calm, saying that all the rumors are just intimidation. (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<h3>Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Exceptionally Busy, Newspapers Still Mocking Poland, Advocating Direct Negotiations with Germany</h3>
<p>Rome: Rumors say that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano returned to Rome from Albania to convene a meeting of Germany, Britain, France, and Poland to seek a peaceful resolution to the current problem. Well-informed sources in Rome seriously deny this, saying that Ciano did not meet with any diplomatic representatives all day yesterday, which shows that the rumors are not credible. Semi-official Italian newspapers continue to maintain a consistent tone, strongly urging Poland to negotiate directly with Germany, and at the same time advising Britain and France not to interfere. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Rome: Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here is exceptionally active, it has revealed no signs of what it is doing. It is believed that the Italian ambassador to Germany, Attolico, met with Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano last night. It is heard that Attolico met with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Munich, but did not meet with Hitler. The "Il Popolo d'Italia" newspaper today published an editorial, first commenting on the critical situation, and then asking Britain and France to consider their responsibilities to the world and the future of their peoples and empires at this most important moment. It also said that France's last-minute appeal for Italy to mediate in order to save peace is truly remarkable. The French must reread their words against Italy during the Munich Conference and recall everything France has done to Italy's interests. Italy's policy is the Axis policy. Italy has advised Poland to conduct direct negotiations with Germany. If this, a timely mediation, is not understood and followed, it is not Italy's fault. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>The Pope's Anxious Gaze Upon Difficult Times</h3>
<p>Vatican City: Rumors that the Pope has sent a special envoy to Warsaw have been denied here today. It is heard that the Vatican's envoy to Poland, Renzivo, is in Warsaw handling the Vatican's diplomatic affairs. According to Vatican sources, the Pope cannot and does not want to make any specific suggestions for resolving the crisis, because he still wants to remain outside the disputes that are not within his mission. However, the Pope earnestly hopes that everyone will pay attention to their duty to save mankind from the scourge of war. The Pope also asks those who can influence major changes to always have a sense of responsibility. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Polish Ambassador to Germany Suddenly Returns Home, Newspapers Give Little Coverage to News of German-Soviet Understanding</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Following the decision by Germany and the Soviet Union to conclude a non-aggression treaty, the Polish ambassador to Germany, Lipski, returned here from Berlin yesterday at midnight on a special plane. He was immediately received by Foreign Minister Beck. The French ambassador to Poland, Noël, also visited the Foreign Minister for talks shortly afterwards. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Regarding the agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union to negotiate a non-aggression treaty, the semi-official Polish Press Agency has issued a statement saying, "This action by Germany and the Soviet Union has not caused a deep impression in our political circles. The balance of power in Europe has not undergone any major changes as a result. What we can say is that the Soviet Union has now openly withdrawn from the European political stage. This can already be seen from the protracted indecision of the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations. Our attitude remains the same."</p>
<h3>Anglo-French-Soviet Mutual Assistance Negotiations Can Still Continue</h3>
<p>Moscow: Responsible officials here have stated that the non-aggression treaty to be signed between Germany and the Soviet Union is not a treaty of assistance to aggression. All previous non-aggression treaties concluded by the Soviet Union with other countries contained an extreme clause stipulating that if one of the signatory countries commits aggression against a third country, the other country can automatically invalidate the treaty. This will also be the case this time. In addition, the Soviet Union and Britain and France can still conclude an agreement, and will not be affected by this decision in any way. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: According to news received here, talks between Britain and France in Moscow will continue. However, according to a Reuters correspondent in Moscow, the military representatives of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union did not hold a meeting this morning. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Delegation to Arrive in Italy, Led by Terauchi Daisuke</h3>
<p>Rome: The Japanese delegation, led by former Minister of War Terauchi Juichi and Admiral Rokkaku Shigenari, will arrive at the port of Naples on August 28. The delegation will stay in Italy for a long time. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd). The newspapers have not given this prominent coverage. Most newspapers only mention it on the second page in a few lines, which shows that the government does not want to overemphasize this matter or cause the public to have a bad impression. As for the comments made by the newspapers, they only state that the Soviet Union has effectively withdrawn from the European political stage and is fully dealing with the Far Eastern problem. Political figures here say that this is Germany's strategy to deal with Poland and the Western European democracies. The future attitude of Poland must wait until the reaction of Britain and France is determined. In addition, the question of what impact this action by Germany and the Soviet Union will have on the Anti-Comintern Pact and the Far Eastern situation is of great concern to the general public here. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>American Observations</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to observations by senior government officials and those familiar with current affairs here, if Germany and the Soviet Union conclude a non-aggression treaty, the position of Germany and Italy will be greatly strengthened, making it possible for Germany to forcefully resolve the Danzig and Polish Corridor issues. However, some political circles still harbor doubts about the conclusion of the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty. They believe that this stance by the Soviet Union is either to pressure Britain and France to accept the Soviet Union's demand for a military alliance. (Associated Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>New York: News that Germany and the Soviet Union will sign a non-aggression treaty has drawn great attention here. This morning, newspapers here carried the headline in large letters: Hitler's "Diplomatic Masterstroke". However, officials are still taking a cautious and silent attitude towards this matter. The New York Times said that the motive for this news may be false propaganda. If it is true, the impact will be great. It seems that Stalin is attempting to avoid Soviet participation in the European war. In other words, the Soviet Union's main interests are in the Far East. Furthermore, if this treaty is concluded, the balance of power in Europe will immediately change, dealing a severe blow to Poland. The newspaper's London correspondent said that if this treaty is concluded, Britain will suffer a great disgrace, and Germany will win another diplomatic victory. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Los Angeles: Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said today that in recent months, there has been no greater crisis or possibility of war in Europe than today. He said that although he advocates American neutrality, "the United States cannot be completely indifferent to changes in the situation in Europe." (Associated Press, 21st)</p>
<h3>British Nationals in Poland Ordered to Evacuate, German Embassy Staff Also Returning Home One After Another</h3>
<p>Warsaw: The British Consul General here has issued a notice stating that the situation in Europe is critical. British nationals residing in Poland should leave the country as soon as possible unless they have special reasons to stay. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Reporters from German newspapers and news agencies have left here. Jahnke, a reporter from the semi-official German News Agency, although Polish, has also left. Also, several members of the German Embassy left at the end of last week. It is not known whether they will return to their posts. (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<h3>Slapping Case of American Woman in Tianjin, US Considers Closed</h3>
<p>(Washington) US Undersecretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the State Department has closed the case of the slapping of Mrs. Li Que-te, an American, in Tianjin by Japanese soldiers. Welles continued that, according to reports received by the State Department from the American consuls in Peiping-Tianjin and Tokyo, Japanese officials have expressed their apologies for the case and have guaranteed that attacks on American citizens will not occur again in the future.

<h3>Poland Uses French Loan</h3>
<p>Warsaw: France and Poland signed an agreement on the 18th of this month to provide Poland with a commercial credit loan of 430 million francs. President Mościcki has issued an order to allow the Ministry of Finance to use this loan and has decided on the repayment period and interest rate. (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>

<p>Zhaoqing: After the Japanese troops, numbering over a thousand, occupied Du Ruan on the afternoon of the 20th, they immediately launched fierce attacks on Pingdiling and Jinggen, using smoke screens to cover the advance of infantry and cavalry. The Chinese troops defending the mountainous area around Bijia Mountain took advantage of the superior terrain to repeatedly engage the Japanese in close combat. The fighting continued until evening. Most of the Japanese troops were annihilated by the Chinese. The remnants fled back to Jiangmen along their original route. In this battle, over 300 Japanese soldiers were killed, a great victory on the Western Front. (Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Luoyang: After the Chinese troops' bloody battle lasting several days, Jincheng, the main stronghold south of Jin, was completely recovered at dawn on the 20th. The remaining Japanese troops collapsed northward. The Chinese troops entered the city, on the one hand, comforting the civilians, and on the other hand, pursuing the Japanese. The momentum was like a broken bamboo, and they were about to advance into Gaoping. On the southern route, the Chinese troops also took the opportunity to attack, and on the evening of the 20th, they captured Tianjingguan Jinmiaoguan (south of Jincheng). The Japanese troops fled in disarray. The Chinese troops have now pursued to the Shantou River (southeast of Jinmiaoguan) and continue to clear out the Japanese troops. (Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

The French government has protested to the Japanese. (Associated Press, 21st)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Chinese officials here are extremely excited about the news of the recovery of Jincheng, an important military town in southeastern Shanxi. This morning, all Chinese-language newspapers published this news in large characters, saying that the recovery of Jincheng is the total collapse of the Japanese offensive in the Taihang Mountains. According to Chinese military sources in Shanxi Province, the Chinese troops completely recovered Jincheng on the morning of August 20 after ten days of fierce fighting. The Japanese troops retreated northward. Earlier, the Chinese troops advanced towards Jincheng from the east on August 10. After two days of fierce fighting, they finally reached the western suburbs of the city. At the same time, another Chinese mobile unit also arrived in the bushes north of Jincheng. The Japanese troops then launched an offensive against the main force of the Chinese troops west of the city under the cover of heavy artillery. The Chinese troops immediately withdrew, luring the Japanese troops out of the city, giving the Chinese troops on the east side of the city an opportunity to launch a surprise attack, and entered Jincheng at noon on August 13. The two armies fought in the streets for three days. Japanese planes also participated in the bombing. On the 16th, the Chinese troops in the city retreated to outside the city. The Chinese commander ordered a general counterattack on the evening of the 19th. After a night of fierce fighting, the Chinese troops recovered Jincheng the next morning. The Japanese troops retreated to the northwest. Later, the Japanese troops obtained reinforcements and immediately launched a counterattack from the northwest, but were repulsed by the Chinese troops and suffered heavy casualties. Jincheng has fallen to the Japanese troops three times, but each time it has been quickly recovered by the Chinese troops. (Reuters, 22nd).</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Sincerely Concerned About People's Livelihood, Bumper Harvest in Sichuan Province This Year, Deeply Concerned About Low Grain Prices Harming Farmers, Telegraphically Instructed President Kong of the Executive Yuan to Instruct Practical Relief Measures</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in view of the bumper harvest in Sichuan this year, and deeply concerned that low grain prices would harm farmers and affect people's livelihood, telegraphed to President Kong of the Executive Yuan today, instructing relief measures. Kong, President of the Executive Yuan, is informed that according to reports from various sources, Sichuan has seen a bumper harvest this year, which is beneficial to the people's food and military supplies. This is a gratifying thing during the War of Resistance and is truly comforting. However, observing the situation among the people, there are two phenomena: one is that as a result of the bumper harvest, grain prices in various places have uniformly fallen, which has caused low grain prices to harm farmers; the other is that due to the high prices of other commodities, wages have increased accordingly, so that some poor farmers are watching the abundant harvest of crops, but are unable to afford to hire workers to harvest them. Upon learning of this, I am deeply concerned. In addition to my telegraphic order to the troops and security teams stationed in various places to earnestly assist farmers in speeding up the harvest to protect grain production, the issue of low rice prices should be handled jointly by the central government and the Sichuan Provincial Government. They should quickly plan practical and effective measures to actively maintain reasonable prices. On the part of the central government, a fund should be allocated from the national treasury, instructing the Agricultural Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Farmers Bank to ascertain the total rice production in the province, conduct practical planning, formulate the quantity to be purchased, determine appropriate prices, and plan for large-scale purchases. On the other hand, the Ministry of Finance should instruct public and private banks to do their best to assist in this matter. Applications for loans from institutions that purchase agricultural products for non-profit purposes should be reviewed based on the actual situation to facilitate them. Tangible collateral should be regarded as the most secure, and should not be rejected because it is cumbersome. On the part of the provincial government, in addition to the provincial local banks being responsible for providing as much funding as possible at the local level in each county, they should also order cooperative organizations, food management organizations, and county governments throughout the province to assist in the purchase, so that the central and local governments can work together and closely link up. It must be ensured that each county in the province, to the best of its ability, can ensure that genuine farmers obtain the actual benefits of this year's bumper harvest, so that they can stabilize their livelihoods. My concern for people's livelihood is extremely sincere. Please have the Executive Yuan preside over and supervise the immediate dispatch to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Sichuan Provincial Government to swiftly follow the above-mentioned guidelines and proceed immediately, informing all subordinate competent authorities to expedite the work without delay. The specific implementation methods should be submitted as a basis for assessment, and the competent authorities should also report the implementation methods at any time. All the handling situation should be reported. Chiang Chungcheng, the 22nd in Chongqing. (Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Fenggang County Organizes Volunteer Corps</h3>
<p>Guiyang: Chen []tao, the county head of Qian Fenggang, is working hard on conscription propaganda in the county, so the awareness of the War of Resistance is deeply rooted in people's hearts. Currently, there are more than 1,500 people in the county who are willing to serve as volunteers. All of the county's social training instructors, conscription section chiefs, secretaries, district chiefs, etc., have voluntarily participated. Principals, teachers, and students have also strongly requested to participate, reaching more than 300 people. This has set a new record for voluntary military service in various places since the War of Resistance. Chen has now organized the Fenggang Volunteer Corps and has resigned from his post as county head. He intends to request to be transferred to serve as the commander of the corps, leading these more than 1,000 able-bodied men to the front lines. Once approved, they will go to Chongqing for training and then transfer to the front. (Dispatch, 21st)</p>

<h3>Train Service West of Changzhou Interrupted</h3>
<p>According to outside sources in Hong Kong, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, which was forcibly controlled by the Japanese, has been interrupted again due to an obstacle between Changzhou and Nanjing. Therefore, although the northbound train from Shanghai to Nanjing still ran on the 21st, the sale of tickets for stations west of Changzhou was suspended. As for the reason, it is believed to be related to the guerrilla attacks by the Chinese on trains and the destruction of railways. (Dispatch, 21st)</p>

<h3>The Result of the Tianjin Flood: North China Trade Completely Stagnates; Vast Expanse of Water on Both Sides of the Pingjin Railway</h3>
<p>As a result of the floods in Beijing and Tianjin, trade in North China has come to a complete standstill, and the exchange rate of the legal tender in Tianjin has fallen from four pence to below three pence. Railway operations have become chaotic. Trains arriving here from Tianjin are filled with Chinese people fleeing the floods. Many of them spent last night at the Tianjin railway station platform waiting for the train to depart. According to travelers, both sides of the Pingjin railway are a vast expanse of water. If the rain continues, traffic on the Pingjin railway may be cut off. Beijing has not yet been flooded, and crops are being harvested as usual. However, it is reported that other parts of Hebei Province are mostly in a state of flooding. (Reuter's telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Beijing: According to the latest news from Tianjin, the flood situation there has slightly improved. The water in the British concession rose to six and a half feet last night, but receded two or three feet this morning. However, business is still impossible to conduct, there is still no electricity, and telephone lines have not been repaired. (Reuter's telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>The National Government Decides to Plan the Establishment of Reclamation Zones to Settle Refugees</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The National Government has now decided to establish "National Reclamation Zones" to settle wartime refugees, so that they can obtain living space and occupations. The detailed plan has been passed by the National Assembly. The Ministries of Finance and Economics and the National Relief Commission will jointly handle it. The method is to establish ten reclamation zones in the seven provinces of Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guangxi, Hunan, Gansu, and Shaanxi, two in each of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Shaanxi, and one in each of the other four provinces. In the future, a central administrative organ will be established to be responsible for promoting this work, and experts will be hired to assist in the work. Regarding this matter, according to reports received here, there are 20,000 refugees and 3,000 refugee children who have fled from the occupied areas to the border of Hunan, preparing to flee to Sichuan. It is hoped that they will be settled in these reclamation zones in the future. (Haitong telegram on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Anti-British Tide in South China Has Not Yet Been Launched</h3>
<p>Guangzhou: According to observations by foreigners here, the Japanese army in South China currently has no intention of launching an anti-British movement. It is heard that the Japanese army in North China had asked the Japanese army in South China to also launch an anti-British movement, but the Japanese army in South China did not agree. They only slightly searched the Chinese people entering and leaving the concessions, but it only lasted for a few days, and then it was stopped. At the same time, it was once forbidden for Chinese people to be employed as foreign employees, and Chinese servants who brought food for foreigners were deliberately harassed, but after diplomatic protests, it was stopped again. The treatment of British people arriving in Guangzhou by sentries is no different from that of people of other nationalities. According to a Japanese military spokesman, the Japanese side is now paying attention to the effect of Wang Jingwei's activities to determine future actions.

<h3>A Man Shot Dead in Front of the Hong Kong Nanhua Daily, Rumored to be Wang's Nephew or Cousin, Three Assassins Acted Swiftly</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: At around 9 a.m. this morning, a middle-aged man was walking out of a club on Wyndham Street when he was shot dead by three people near the Nanhua Daily. The deceased was named Shen Song and was said to be Wang's nephew. He was shot three times in the head. The shooters all escaped, leaving behind two axes, which have been sent to the police station.

The three assassins acted extremely swiftly, completing the matter in just a few seconds and calmly leaving. (Associated Press telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Economic Situation in the Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to a government official who has returned from inspecting various provinces in Central China, the economic problem in the occupied areas is more important than the political one. Taking Anhui as an example, Japanese goods are everywhere. The large ones are transported in from Shanghai, and they all have counterfeit Chinese trademarks, so it is extremely difficult to identify them. The Chinese side has now hired experts to identify them. Another serious problem is the Japanese side's use of economic resources in the occupied areas. The method is to have the Japanese side exclusively buy and sell the main products. For example, the rice in Wuhu has been purchased in large quantities by the Japanese side, and the price has risen to 20 yuan per dan (unit of weight), but on the opposite bank of the river, it is only sold for 6 yuan per dan. It is also said that although Anhui's finances are difficult, income and expenditure can still offset each other. The difficult thing is actually the currency system problem.

<h3>The Tianjin Four Chinese Case: The British Supreme Court Heard the Case Yesterday; The Foreign Secretary's Representative Attended and Stated the Government's Opinion</h3>
<p>London: This morning, when Supreme Court Judge Caisells heard the case of the habeas corpus writ for the four suspects in Tianjin again, the applicant was represented by Sir Cornwall, the Public Prosecutor, and civil representatives. Sir Listowell, in the affidavit submitted in the name of the Aid China Movement Committee, strongly stated that the American side's intention to extradite the four people to the Japanese side was completely illegal and unjust. According to the provisions of the Tianjin Treaty, the British authorities can hand over these four people to the Chinese authorities, but there is no reason to extradite them to the Japanese side. Mr. Monckton strongly stated that because there is currently no legally organized Chinese government in Tianjin, it would be inappropriate to hand over these four people to a court of an usurper. "There is undoubtedly a legally organized Chinese court in Shanghai. The Shanghai court has requested in the past few days that these four people be handed over to that court for trial." Mr. Monckton also said that there is currently no fact that can indicate that the Chinese authorities in Tianjin have inherited the treaty rights that the Chinese side there should enjoy. Mr. O'Connor, who represented Foreign Secretary Halifax, argued that the Tianjin court still exists and performs its duties. It is absurd to request that these four suspects be sent to London. He really could not say how many warships of the domestic fleet would be needed to achieve this goal. The lawyer representing the applicant did not indicate who entrusted him to issue this request for these four people. He deeply suspected whether these four people themselves were willing to make this request. Mr. O'Connor also said that the habeas corpus writ could not be issued to the Foreign Secretary, because the Foreign Secretary had no jurisdiction over these four people, just as he did not. All the Foreign Secretary can do at present is to convey the advice he received in London to the British Ambassador to China. Furthermore, this kind of habeas corpus writ does not and has never had anything to do with foreigners abroad. It was announced at the beginning of the case that it would be heard publicly in court.

<h3>After Returning Home, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Issues a Statement, Still Emphasizing National Honor, Acknowledging Pressure from Germany and Italy</h3>
<p>Budapest: Foreign Minister Csáky recently gave an interview to a reporter from the semi-official Hungarian News Agency, stating, "All the rumors caused by my visit to Germany and Italy are not true. In fact, no one has expressed any wishes to me, nor has any demands been made on the Hungarian government. We have always emphasized national honor, but we also do not want to have any estrangement with friendly countries." (Havas telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>Budapest: After returning from Germany, Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky claimed that no one in Germany or Italy had made any demands on the Hungarian government or its Foreign Minister. It is reported that Csáky met with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Germany, and then visited Hitler at Berchtesgaden. Although Csáky declared to a Hungarian newspaper reporter that he was temporarily residing in Germany in a purely private capacity and was not conducting negotiations with anyone, it is generally believed that Germany wants Hungary to join the Axis military alliance, so that Hungary will be bound by military, political, and financial restrictions.

<h3>Stalin: The Trend of Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>After Germany annexed Czechoslovakia on March 15th of this year, British Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately suggested to the Soviet Union that they form a tripartite alliance against aggression between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, to resist the Axis powers of Germany and Italy. The Soviet Union immediately accepted, and negotiations began. It has now been more than five months, and they are still negotiating. The international situation is critically dangerous, yet they proceed with such composure and ease. This is truly a rare event in diplomatic history. It is all because Chamberlain harbors ulterior motives, fearing that if the alliance succeeds and the three nations of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union defeat Germany, the Soviet Union's power will reach Central Europe, making it extremely difficult to deal with in the future. At the same time, because of Germany's aggression, the situation is perilous, so he is using negotiations for an alliance with the Soviet Union to continue promoting his appeasement policy, hoping that Germany will therefore comply and achieve a temporary peace. What kind of person is Hitler? How could he be intimidated? And what kind of person is Stalin? How could he willingly be used? As a result, Germany's aggression has intensified step by step, and the Soviet alliance has become a pipe dream. According to recent telegraphic reports, Germany and the Soviet Union have signed a credit loan agreement and will soon conclude a non-aggression pact. It is unknown what magical powers Chamberlain will have to deal with this. The following is an excerpt from the American publication "Modern History," which explains Stalin's foreign policy very clearly. Reading it can reveal the reasons why the Anglo-Soviet negotiations have been so slow to succeed. As for the end of the article, which hopes that Stalin will join the democratic countries rather than the Axis powers, that is the American standpoint, and of course, they would make such a suggestion. In short, if the Soviet-German non-aggression pact is established, or if there are further actions, it will all be the consequence of Chamberlain's "insincerity." Translator</p>
<p>"To make Germany and the Soviet Union fight each other is a blessing for Britain because if these two countries fight until they are bloody and bruised, Britain will become even stronger." This was a striking statement made by Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov during his May 31st speech on foreign policy. Although this speech still left the door open for continued negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union, he believed that the proposals made by Britain and France to enlist Moscow's support for an anti-aggression agreement were insufficient and therefore rejected them.</p>
<p>When the Soviet Communist Party held a major meeting in March of this year, Stalin himself could have made such a statement in his speech. At that time, Stalin criticized Western European democracies for trying to increase the Soviet Union's hostility towards Germany, poisoning the atmosphere, and inciting the Soviet Union to start a war with Germany without clear justification. In fact, this statement had already been made on May 23, 1914, two months before the outbreak of World War I, when the Imperial Russian Duma convened, expressing distrust of Britain. It was made by Markov, an extremely conservative monarchist deputy. This deputy, a staunch supporter of the Romanov dynasty's autocracy, made a memorable speech at the time, expressing perpetual suspicion about the gifts offered by Russia to Britain. Markov said, "British friendship can only exist when there is no need for active assistance to Russia…If we were to conclude a small alliance with Germany, that would be much better than forming a great friendship with Britain." Today, on the eve of the second world war, which seems about to break out again in twenty-five years, Stalin sees Britain reluctantly extending its hand with the same trepidation as before. The previous time it was extended, the Rasputin (the "mad monk" of Imperial Russia) clique around Tsar Nicholas II was disturbed. This time, the Soviet people cannot avoid becoming suspicious. As for Soviet public opinion regarding its own foreign policy, it is completely in the dark because ten years of Bolshevik revolutionary propaganda have greatly obscured the obvious fact that "the Soviet Union is Russia."</p>
<p>The Soviet Union must now choose a policy. The decision it makes is of great importance. In determining the future of the Soviet Union and the world, it will indeed play a decisive role. This decision rests in the hands of one person, Stalin. It would be a misunderstanding to think that he has completely destroyed the legacy he created when he was a revolutionary Bolshevik. All of his political training was under the guidance of Lenin. In Lenin's mind, Russia was never just a country.</p>
<p>Lenin's theories were largely formulated during his exile abroad, living in humble dwellings in London, Stockholm, Geneva, Munich, Krakow, and Zurich. He was an internationalist, not only because he had read Marx's works, but also because he had spent most of his adult life as a stateless person. He seized power during a period of general social upheaval and wartime and post-war chaos in Europe. He saw that all the countries of the world were coming to an end, and that an international labor dictatorship would be born in response, rising to replace them. With this belief, he personally signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, forfeiting one-third of European Russian territory. Originally, he sincerely believed that as long as the Russian Bolshevik Party could retain power for a short period, by the "red day of judgment," all the boundaries of all the countries in Europe would disappear without a trace. Until the day he died, he did not attend meetings on national power politics.</p>
<p>Stalin, however, was very different from Lenin. Although he was born in Georgia, he was more Russian than Lenin's disciples, who were exiled in Europe in their early years and constantly flitted from one capital to another. Before the Russian Revolution, he rarely lived outside the Empire. After joining the Bolshevik Party, he still lived in various cities and villages in Russia, sometimes in remote parts of Siberia. In his view, the "International Labor System" was nothing more than an abstraction of Lenin's beliefs. His experience came entirely from associating with Russian farmers, workers, and police.</p>
<p>Soon after Lenin's death, Stalin broke with the main tenets of Bolshevism, which required the international movement to achieve its goals. Trotsky and Zinoviev continued to stir up trouble in the international labor movement and the world revolution. Stalin gradually turned his gaze to the Russian Empire, its people, and its unlimited resources. Stalin won.</p>
<p>For twelve years, Stalin has been directing the policies of the Soviet Union with a single finger in the palaces where the Tsars used to govern. In recent years, he has done everything within his power to revive Russian national patriotism. He encouraged people to read the works of famous figures who were previously considered middle-class and restorationist and were banned. Soviet cinemas now show the battle achievements of early Russian princes and tsars, regarding them as national glory. This was absolutely forbidden in Lenin's time. Soviet newspapers have now actively resumed using the phrase "motherland" as a propaganda topic. This phrase was considered the most opposed to revolution and internationalism in the past. He also instructed people that for the sake of Russian territory, it is worthwhile to fight, even sacrificing their lives. Stalin's foreign policy unfolds in this atmosphere. This is also the background that makes his foreign policy understandable. The recent foreign actions of the Soviet Union are all dominated by its own national interests. This can be best evidenced by the newspapers run abroad by Soviet exiles. These newspapers are very unkind to Stalin, and even more disliked by Bolshevik foreign policy. One is the daily newspaper published in Paris by Professor Milyukov, who was foreign minister in the short-lived Russian democratic republic in 1917. The other is the bi-monthly magazine published by Kerensky, who was prime minister in that government. Both publications are supplied with news at any time by authoritative secret visitors living in the Soviet Union. They foresaw that the Soviet Union's foreign policy would change long before the world saw even the slightest hint of it. Milyukov's newspaper pointed out that between the Munich Conference in September 1938 and the occupation of Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, in March of this year, the Soviet Union must have sold a large amount of goods to Germany.</p>
<p>After the Munich Conference, Hitler formulated a plan to establish an autonomous Carpathian Ukraine state in the eastern suburbs of Czechoslovakia and used huge sums to encourage the Ukrainian separatist movement. The Western European powers did not regard this as a major concern, thinking that German troops would soon attack Soviet Ukraine. However, in March, this piece of land was given to Hungary, so Hitler's plan was shelved. The harmonious relationship between Berlin and Moscow greatly unsettled the nerves of Downing Street in London. The Soviet Union has undoubtedly returned to national power politics. The Communist Party is quite perplexed by Stalin's flirting with Germany, but this is a strategic movement aimed at dealing with those who recently attempted to sacrifice the Soviet Union to appease Hitler. Therefore, the essence of this movement is to preserve the Soviet Union as a European power. Russia's experience in dealing with Britain over the past hundred years has made Moscow deal with Britain "with caution in every move." Imperial Russia once saw Britain monopolize advantages in Asia, the Far East, the Bosphorus, and the Balkans to control its enemies.</p>
<p>Only the possibility of Soviet-German amity has forced Great Britain to interact with the Soviet Union on equal terms, or without any conditions, because only this trick can make Britain anxious.</p>
<p>As far as the international communist movement is concerned, Soviet-German understanding is a fatal blow because the propaganda of the Third International has always focused on anti-fascism. But from the standpoint of Soviet national security, this scheme is not without legitimate reasons. Stalin said at the Communist Party Congress, "Our constitution is the most democratic in the world. No one dares to question this fact."</p>
<p>This is indeed close to sincerity on paper. There are very few remedial clauses in the middle, or they have been eliminated, or they still exist. It is appropriate to regard it as a privilege for existing rights and freedoms, but it has a propaganda effect. The creation of this constitution is part of a fervent effort to cultivate patriotism and national conscience to cope with the danger of war. It floats like a ghost over the Kremlin.</p>
<p>The final task of fighting on the side of the Western European democratic countries, and the vague excuse for gaining freedom as a result, is sufficient as a stimulus. That is exactly what the Soviet people need for their suppressed aspirations for political freedom. A Soviet state taking up arms and fighting alongside Britain and France to resist the principles of totalitarian states in 1939, even like the League of Nations in 1914, has already shaken autocracy.</p>
<p>Stalin cannot blindly ignore the demand to clearly join the Western European democratic countries and abandon autocratic Germany. However, the fact that the Soviet Union is on the side of the invaded has created the image of her as a country dedicated to peace, and has repeatedly warned and cared for the country with several plans, and has clearly understood most of world opinion, whether it is correct or wrong, so he cannot make a choice in his decision.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union now enjoys great international prestige, exceeding any era in recent history. Even the most stubborn power-holders cannot lightly abandon this prestige. No matter which path he takes, there are dangers. However, if he colludes with Hitler, the Soviet Union will immediately lose its moral standing in the eyes of the Soviet people and world opinion.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union now, like in 1914, has to decide what to take and what to leave. This decision must go beyond the personal likes and dislikes of her dictator. Stalin, forced by historical turmoil, must replace the monster of world revolution with the interests of the Soviet Union, must pay attention to changes in the situation, and take a tragic and heroic path.</p>
<h3>Portuguese President Returns Home from South Africa</h3>
<p>Cape Town: Portuguese President General Carmona has completed his visit to the Union of South Africa and today boarded the "Colonial" ship here to begin his journey. A large crowd gathered at the pier to warmly see him off. A British warship and the shore fired a 21-gun salute. According to reports, General Carmona is the first foreign head of state to set foot on South African territory. The purpose of this trip was to inspect the Portuguese African colonies. After completing the inspection, he came here for a visit. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Reoccupy Shenzhen, British Troops Urgently Move to Border for Alert</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Shenzhen, close to Hong Kong Kowloon, was once occupied by Japanese troops last year. After a counterattack by Chinese troops, the Japanese troops withdrew north along the Kowloon-Canton Railway line. On the evening of the 15th of this month, Japanese troops invaded Shenzhen again. On the morning of the 16th, they arrived at the Sino-British border. The British troops stationed in Hong Kong immediately dispatched a company of the Middlesex Regiment and a company of Indian soldiers to guard the border. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Land</p>
<p>On the evening of the 15th, a thousand Japanese troops, with several light artillery pieces and more than ten machine guns, departed from Taiping, Dongguan County, on a Japanese merchant ship and two transport ships. They arrived in the waters off Bin'an County in the evening. At that time, there was a strong storm. The Japanese troops then boarded dozens of speedboats and landed in Chiwan, infiltrating Nantou (i.e., Bao'an County seat). Chinese troops joined forces with the local militia to bravely resist, but due to the disparity in numbers, they retreated to a certain high ground north of the city, and Nantou was lost. On the morning of the 16th, small ferries traveling between Hong Kong and Nantou departed as usual. When they arrived at Shekou, they could not dock and returned to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Shenzhen Falls</p>
<p>After occupying Nantou, the Japanese troops, with a force of more than five hundred, turned to the highway towards Shenzhen. Among them were a cavalry unit and a bicycle unit. Fearing an ambush by the Chinese along the way, the Japanese troops dispatched four aircraft to provide cover. These Japanese aircraft flew to Shenzhen at around 5 a.m. on the 16th for low-altitude reconnaissance and then flew towards Buji. It was reported that three bombs were dropped in Buji. At around 8 a.m., they returned to Shenzhen and conducted low-altitude strafing. After discovering the vanguard of the Japanese troops, the Chinese militia immediately coordinated with the local police force and calmly fired at the Japanese troops. Later, as the main force of the Japanese troops arrived, they gradually retreated to a certain place, preparing for a counterattack. At this point, Shenzhen fell again. Customs and radio stations received the news, and all staff members safely retreated into British territory and are now gathered in Sheung Shui in the New Territories. A farmer wounded in Shenzhen entered British territory and said that Shenzhen farmers found to have weapons are all slaughtered by the Japanese troops. After the Japanese troops entered Shenzhen City, they began searching house by house. If firearms were found, the able-bodied men in the house were dragged out and executed on the spot. The farmer saw several people carrying rifles surrender to the Japanese troops, but that did not guarantee their lives. The farmer (as he called himself) killed two Japanese soldiers and was then pursued by a Japanese squad and fired upon more than a hundred times. He was finally able to enter British territory. Although he was hit by a bullet in the arm, it was not fatal, and he considered himself fortunate.</p>
<p>British Troops on Alert</p>
<p>After receiving news of the Japanese troops' invasion of Shenzhen, the Hong Kong authorities ordered the local garrison to be on strict alert and dispatched a company of British Middlesex Regiment and a company of Indian Riflemen to the border. Both teams arrived at the border at noon on the 16th. About 50 people were stationed in Lo Wu, and more than 100 were stationed in Man Kam To. The defenses were stricter in Lo Wu because Japanese troops were stationed in the Shenzhen Hotel, facing them from a distance. The crossing was closed with barbed wire. Four British soldiers patrolled with loaded guns, not allowing pedestrians to pass. However, the Man Kam To section was not closed because no Japanese troops had been found, and pedestrians could enter and exit as usual. However, there were many British and Indian soldiers and police. A small portion of the refugees who fled from the Lo Wu military entrance also returned to Chinese territory from that location in the afternoon. The majority flocked to the Sheung Shui and Fanling areas, looking particularly miserable and indignant at the devastation of their hometown and fields.</p>
<p>Refugees Retreat</p>
<p>After the Japanese troops invaded last year, the Shenzhen Hotel was converted into a refugee shelter and temporary hospital. The Red Cross rescue team and the World Red Cross Society both sent personnel to serve there, housing more than a thousand refugees. After receiving news on the morning of the 16th that Japanese troops were infiltrating Shenzhen, the shelter evacuated all the refugees towards British territory. The sick were transported by ambulance, and the refugees moved to Yikeng in Fanling. The sick were transported to Kwong Wah Hospital in Kowloon. According to news from the rescue team, the staff was exceptionally diligent. Those who could not retreat in time due to the suddenness of the event included four rescue team members and more than fifty wounded soldiers. Also, according to reports, the refugees who fled from Bao'an to British territory on the 16th mostly crossed the Shenzhen railway bridge in the morning, but completely disappeared in the afternoon. However, those who fled into the old territory from Man Kam To and Sha Tau Kok were endless throughout the day. A refugee map was presented again between Lo Wu, Sheung Shui, and Fanling, with a tragic situation. The Central Relief Committee immediately sent personnel to Sheung Shui, Fanling, Lo Wu, Cha Keng, and Kam Tin to express condolences and inspect, and immediately handled emergency relief. Often, the refugees in that area, originally located at the old site of the Shenzhen Yau Sang Theatre, were the responsibility of the Hong Kong Red Swastika Society. When the incident occurred, the staff of the society rescued all the men, women, and children and evacuated them to the New Territories. They then asked Tsai Pin-tin, a New Territories Councilor and Vice President of the Red Swastika Society, appointed by the Hong Kong government, to temporarily house all 900-plus refugees in the Cha Keng temporary shelter, while rushing to prepare dry food for relief.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Drop in Wuxi and Wujin Counties</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: Rice prices in Wuxi and Wujin counties have soared to 20 yuan per stone, making it difficult for ordinary people to obtain food. Recently, because the Wuhu rice in Anhui Province has been decontrolled, various rice merchants have gone to purchase it one after another. Thirty to forty vehicles of newly harvested rice have been transported, and forty more vehicles are scheduled to be transported to Su, Xi, and Wu counties for sale. Rice prices have fallen. High-quality new rice now only costs 15 yuan per stone, and white glutinous rice costs 17.5 yuan. This year, Anhui Province has had timely rainfall, and the autumn harvest is very abundant. The rice is of good quality and color. However, when transporting it to Shanghai, exorbitant taxes are levied, and there are various obstacles, making it difficult to reduce costs. The authorities must make every effort to mediate so that the rice can be transported steadily.</p>

<h3>Shanghai West Incident: Municipal Council Lodges Protest, Responsibility Lies with Puppet Police Based on Evidence, Willing to Arbitrate Disputes Fairly, Japanese Side Also Lodges Protest with Council</h3>
<p>Regarding the incident that occurred on Rue de Gascogne on the 19th of this month (Saturday), the Shanghai "Special Municipality" has lodged a protest with the Municipal Council. Yesterday (22nd), in the late evening, the Council sent out its reply. The reply is translated as follows:</p>
<p>Regret Over the Accident</p>
<p>"We regret the occurrence of an accident on Rue de Gascogne on the 19th of this month (Saturday). The letter from the Shanghai Special Municipality regarding the incident, issued on August 21st of this year, has been received by the Council.</p>
<p>Responsibility Lies with the Police Based on Evidence</p>
<p>Regarding the evidence concerning this incident, the Council has carefully reviewed it. Based on all the evidence, the incident should clearly be the responsibility of the police of Your Municipality and cannot be attributed to Patrol Leader Jin Loke, who was leading the Council's police officers at the time. Patrol Leader Jin, in the course of his duties, questioned the police of the Shanghai Special Municipality as to why they were marching in formation with weapons on the Council's roads and what their destination was. While he was questioning them, a member of the police squad of the Shanghai Special Municipality, without reason, became angry and shot and wounded Patrol Leader Jin. The other members of the squad also aimed their weapons at Patrol Leader Jin. Patrol Leader Jin then loaded bullets into his pistol and, for self-defense, fired his weapon in an attempt to disperse the police who were aiming their weapons at him.</p>
<p>Protest Against This Action Should Be Lodged</p>
<p>The Council not only believes that it is not responsible for this unfortunate incident but also believes that a protest should be lodged with Your Municipality regarding the actions of the police of the Shanghai Special Municipality. To maintain law and order, Your Municipality clearly needs to take measures to prevent the same situation from occurring on the Council's roads in the future. It is legal for the personnel of the Council's Police Department to patrol the Council's roads.</p>
<p>Willing to Submit Any Disputes to Arbitration</p>
<p>Based on the evidence obtained from the investigation, the Council firmly believes that the above conclusion is entirely based on facts. If the Shanghai Special Municipality disputes any of the facts ascertained by the Council, the Council is willing to submit the incident to individuals agreed upon by both parties for a fair investigation.</p>
<p>Japanese Consul Also Lodges Protest</p>
<p>Regarding the above incident, the Japanese Consul General has also lodged a protest, which was delivered to the Municipal Council yesterday. The Council has informed the Japanese Consul General of the gist of the reply to the Shanghai Special Municipality and has expressed to the Consul General its willingness to present all the evidence for a fair investigation.</p>
<p>The Council Does Not Recognize the Puppet Regime</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that the Municipal Council has decided to submit a written protest regarding the shooting incident in which Probationary Western Patrol Leader Jin Loke was shot and wounded by armed "Great Road" police on Rue de Gascogne. The nature of this diplomatic procedure by the Council is to protest the letter sent to the Council by Chu Minyi, the "Mayor" of the city under Japanese patronage. It was heard last night that the Council's reply will be sent directly to Mr. Chu. Previously, the Municipal Council had no formal interactions with Mr. Chu. However, according to news received last night, this reply to the puppet "Mayor" will not constitute formal recognition of the municipal authority. "Mayor" Chu visited Franklin, Chairman of the Municipal Council, yesterday. The Municipal Council received Mr. Chu's note before evening. At the same time, it was seen that large reinforcements of Japanese troops outside the Zhao Feng Garden British Defense Zone were patrolling back and forth on the railway controlled by the former group, traveling by truck. The shooting incident was still under investigation yesterday. The Police Department and the "Great Road" side both claim that the other side fired first. The Police Department's firearms expert will determine today (22nd) the firearm from which the bullets fired by the "Great Road" personnel came. Western Patrol Leader Jin Loke is in the Hong Si Hospital, and his injuries have improved well yesterday. Mr. Jin has received many praises for his courageous response.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Uses Excuse to Refuse to Return Authority</p>
<p>According to Japanese sources last night, Consul General Miura sent a letter to Council Chairman Franklin on [date] informing him that the Japanese side had been actively working to restore the Municipal Council's police authority north of the Suzhou Creek. However, because of the unlawful killing of a "Municipal" police officer by a Council police officer, the Japanese side deeply feels that the Municipal Council poses a great danger to maintaining law and order. Therefore, the return of police authority north of the Suzhou Creek has been postponed.</p>
<p>"Reformed Government" Attempts to Recapture Concessions</p>
<p>According to Japanese sources from Nanjing, the "Reformed Government" Ministry of Foreign Affairs has drafted a plan to recover the Shanghai International Settlement as a fundamental solution to the issue of the International Settlement and foreign concessions in China. This move was decided upon because of the shooting incident in Shanghai on the 19th of this month, which involved Jin Loke, a Western patrol leader of the International Settlement, and several police officers of the "Shanghai Municipal Government" under Japanese patronage. This plan will be submitted to the "Reformed Government Executive Yuan for approval.</p>
<h3>Issuance of Fractional Currency Notes: Great Expectations from All Sectors; Many Visited the Central Bank Last Month to Exchange Notes; Postponement of Issuance Purely Due to Unfinished Procedures</h3>
<p>Following the order of the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank commissioned the American firm, Yong Ning Company, to print one-cent and five-cent fractional currency notes. The initial batch of 500,000 yuan was originally scheduled for issuance yesterday. However, due to temporary printing issues, it was decided to postpone the issuance. A public announcement will be made once the printing is completed. As for the handling of postage stamps after the issuance of the fractional currency notes, the Postal Administration has already inquired with the Kunming General Administration yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reason for Postponement: Printing Issues</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned yesterday from the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank that the first batch of 500,000 yuan of fractional currency notes, including 300,000 yuan in one-cent notes and 200,000 yuan in five-cent notes, was commissioned to be printed by the American firm, Yong Ning Company. According to the contract, the goods were to be delivered within 20 days from the date of signing. It was originally scheduled for issuance starting yesterday (i.e., the 22nd). However, due to the fact that the fractional currency notes were not printed as scheduled, the issuance date had to be postponed. A public announcement will be made once the printing is completed and delivered to the bank. Furthermore, a responsible person from the bank firmly stated that the rumors circulating that the issuance would take place on the 23rd were not true.</p>
<p>Thousands Gathered to Exchange Notes Yesterday</p>
<p>People from various industries in this city were delighted to hear that the bank's new fractional currency was officially to be issued at the Shanghai branch starting yesterday morning. Based on reports in yesterday's newspapers, each person would be allowed to exchange up to one yuan. As a result, without prior arrangement, citizens from both settlements carried legal tender worth one yuan each and gathered outside the bank's door on Albert Road, Yiyuan, at dawn yesterday (around 6:00 AM). By nearly 8:00 AM, the road outside the bank's door was blocked, with a crowd of five to six thousand people wanting to exchange notes. Upon receiving the news, the general police station of the French Concession, Lujiawan, dispatched a large number of detectives to maintain order. Subsequently, the bank posted a notice stating that the issuance of fractional currency notes had been temporarily suspended due to incomplete procedures. Only then did the people seeking to exchange notes disperse. Fortunately, no incidents occurred. It was heard that some people came from afar to exchange notes yesterday. Unable to exchange fractional currency notes, they changed to new subsidiary currency notes of one or two dimes. Various responsible persons from the bank stated that the bank's internal procedures had not been completed and that the issuance date would have to be determined by instructions from the head office. No mention was made of the counterfeit notes found on the market.</p>
<p>Tobacco Exchange Notice: Refusal to Accept Counterfeit Notes</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Weiting, chairman of the Tobacco Exchange Association, recently sent a letter to the Central Bank requesting permission to receive the new notes, but has not yet received a reply. He went to the bank at 8:00 AM yesterday to meet with the person in charge and inquire about the situation. He was told that the issuance of the notes would be postponed and that there would be no problem with various industries receiving the notes in the future. However, according to reliable reports, counterfeit notes had already been found circulating on the market. The bank will promptly develop necessary measures. For now, it is hoped that various industries will refuse to use the counterfeit notes before the bank's new notes are issued. After the meeting, Mr. Shen immediately returned to the association and ordered the section to issue a temporary notice, which read: "Regarding the issuance of fractional currency notes by the Central Bank, this association has sent a letter to the bank for collection. Before these fractional currency notes are received, members are requested not to accept or use them temporarily. This is a notice."</p>
<p>No Decision Yet on Minting Aluminum Coins</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the usage, the Central Bank previously planned to issue one-cent and five-cent aluminum coins. After research by the bank and the Ministry of Finance, it was found that the cost of an aluminum one-cent coin would be more than one cent, not including the minting costs. Therefore, after minting, issuance, and circulation, there was great concern that unscrupulous merchants would buy and melt them. Therefore, the plan to mint aluminum coins has not yet been decided. It is believed that issuing fractional currency notes is the most appropriate method. No decision has been made on when the second batch of fractional currency notes will be printed.</p>
<h3>Pay Raise for Postal Workers Settled</h3>
<p>Employees of the Shanghai Postal Administration, finding living difficult due to high prices, previously requested a pay raise from the authorities. It is now known that the temporary measures set by the postal authorities began in July. Those with monthly salaries below 150 yuan received a uniform increase of 7.50 yuan. In the current month, it has been changed to a uniform raise of 7.50 yuan for all those with monthly salaries below 190 yuan. This pay raise will increase the post office's monthly expenses by 25,000 yuan. It is heard that post office gatekeepers have also requested a similar raise, but the postal authorities believe that since they are not postal workers, the request for a pay raise can only be made to the police department. However, it has not been completely rejected, and the general affairs section of the post office is currently considering the matter. Regarding the issue of refusing to hire married female employees, the postal savings and remittance bureau and the Jianghai Customs have already implemented it. The Shanghai Postal Administration, however, has not considered this matter. It is heard that the Shanghai Administration, including female postal workers and postal assistants who were withdrawn from Nanjing to Shanghai, totals seventy to eighty people. Their treatment is the same as that of male employees, except that their vacation time is slightly longer. Their hiring began ten years ago.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Compete to Purchase Scrap Metal to Offer to the Motherland; Competing with a Certain Party at the Same Price; Losses Compensated by Donations from Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war of resistance in the motherland, overseas Chinese in the Philippines have been most enthusiastic about donating funds, offering gold, and purchasing national salvation public bonds, ranking first among overseas Chinese in various regions. Now, the overseas Chinese in the Philippines, seeing that a certain party is searching for old iron to replenish military supplies and gradually extending to the Philippines, have initiated a movement to compete to purchase scrap metal to donate to the motherland as a way to resist this. At present, anti-Japanese associations in Xili Province and other places in the Philippines have established organizations for this purpose, competing with a certain party at the same price. The losses are compensated by donations from overseas Chinese. The situation is very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association Requests Price Controls on Flour; Vagrants in the Western District Attempt to Rob Rice Without Success; It is Heard that Rice Transported to the Huangpu River Has Been Detained</h3>
<p>The Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Regarding the skyrocketing price of flour, we request that you forward the request for price controls to the authorities. Flour is the primary element in supplementing the people's food supply. With the price of rice skyrocketing on the black market to over 30 yuan and the price of flour soaring to 6.20 yuan per bag, the price of food for the people has reached an extreme. The poor cannot make a living. Noodles are a blessing for the working class. If the price increases again, the poor will have no way to make a living. We earnestly request that your chamber approve and immediately forward the request to the authorities that price controls should be imposed on flour. This would be a great benefit. Representatives of the Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association, Chu Shaokun and Wang Jinwen, jointly."</p>
<p>Advising Rice Merchants Not to Hoard</p>
<p>The Municipal High Council sent a letter to the Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Rice Shop Industry Association, stating, "In reply to your previous letter regarding the relief of rice shortages, we are fully aware. Currently, the stock of rice is lacking. The key to relief is to dredge the sources. We have discussed the matter with the Public Concession Works Department to make proper arrangements as soon as possible. Your association should also do its best to negotiate with the Works Department to handle the matter carefully in order to take care of the people's food supply. It is most important to advise members not to hoard rice and secretly sell it in order to achieve their own profit."</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Asks to Dredge Sources</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Public Concession Works Department yesterday, stating, "The price of rice in this city is high, reaching the highest record since the opening of the port. The general residents and commercial employees feel extremely uneasy. Over the past two years, the area under your administration has gradually returned to its original state, and new small-scale industries have also shown signs of recovery. If the rice price crisis causes unrest in all sectors, then the efforts of the Goods Bureau over the past two years will be in vain. The key to this matter need not be elaborated upon by this chamber. Last year's autumn harvest was considered good. The current situation must be due to obstructed sources. If the issue of dredging the sources can be addressed, then the supply of rice will surge, and prices will naturally fall. It is hoped that your bureau will use its authority to break through this difficult situation so that the trend of rice shortages and market shutdowns can be alleviated, and the price of rice will gradually fall, which would be fortunate for both Chinese and foreign citizens. We urge you to strictly investigate and order the sale of rice at fair prices for those who hoard and raise prices in order to prevent the results of dredging rice sources from being exploited by such individuals."</p>
<p>Rice Merchants in the Western District Temporarily Suspend Door-to-Door Sales</p>
<p>At 7:30 PM the night before last, dozens of poorly dressed male and female poor people suddenly came to a rice shop in Xujiahui to buy rice. In the chaos, the poor people took the opportunity to enter and carry out a robbery. Fortunately, the shop clerk was alert and reported to the nearby police station, who came to the scene to suppress the incident, preventing it from happening. As a result, starting yesterday, Yang Baokang, Yisheng, Yida, Shenji in the old street of Xujiahui Town, Maoshun, Yuanyuan in Tongren Street, and Quansheng, Gonghe, Wanxing, Shundetai, Wanshun, Chengda, Yongheng, Daxing, Xinji, and Santai, Cihongshun, and other rice shops, had no rice for sale. Even if there was a small amount of rice in stock, they were afraid of accidents during sales and temporarily suspended door-to-door sales.</p>
<p>Rice Transported to Shanghai Intercepted in the Huangpu River</p>
<p>According to news from the Miscellaneous Grains Industry, a large quantity of rice, more than 10,000 bags, was purchased and loaded onto the Japanese merchant ship Lun Xijiu Maru for convenience in order to sell it at a good price in Shanghai. However, it was intercepted by the Japanese naval authorities in the Huangpu River, and a satisfactory arrangement has not yet been reached.</p>
<h3>Borrowing Rice Issues: Attempt to Take Over the Court; The Puppet "Municipal Government" Sends Letters to the Consular Corps and the Public Concession Bureau Again; Hoping for an Early Reply on This Matter</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reports, "'Mayor' Fu Xiao'an sent a letter to the Consular Corps and the Public Concession Bureau yesterday (the 21st), urging cooperation with the 'Shanghai Municipal Government' in order to prohibit wartime merchants from manipulating rice. The letter stated that the most effective way to curb the activities of merchants is to transfer the jurisdiction of the First and Second Special District Courts to the 'Great Way' authorities, which will severely punish the merchants. Regarding the matter of the court, he has repeatedly negotiated with the Consular Corps and the Public Concession Bureau, but has not yet received a reply or expressed an opinion, which is regrettable. Please give the most serious consideration to this issue and reply as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>Efforts to Rescue Four Chinese in Tianjin: Continuing Efforts; British Lawyers Appeal Directly to the Full Court to Issue a Writ of Habeas Corpus</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that Mr. Jones, from the British law firm of Ellis &amp; Hays, told reporters yesterday (the 20th) that there will be important developments today (the 22nd) regarding the case of the writ of habeas corpus for the four persons detained in Tianjin. The result of the petition submitted last week by Aird &amp; Birbeck (the legal representatives of Ellis &amp; Hays in England) is that it has been decided to apply to the court in London today for a writ of habeas corpus. It is understood that Ellis &amp; Hays has already applied for a writ of habeas corpus in Shanghai regarding the extradition of the four Chinese suspects in Tianjin, but it was rejected by Magistrate Jones. However, Jones and Leeks, representing Ellis &amp; Hays, are prepared to appeal directly to the Full Court to issue a writ of habeas corpus if the petition by the London representatives fails today. In this case, Magistrate Moss will convene an appeal court. This court may be composed of only two magistrates, namely Magistrate Jones and Moss himself, or it may be composed of three magistrates. The third magistrate may be the clerk Haynes or someone else well-versed in the law appointed by Magistrate Moss. British law recognizes the importance of personal freedom and should allow applications to be made to any number of magistrates. Therefore, if the petition by Aird &amp; Birbeck fails today, Jones will first appeal to Magistrate Moss, and Magistrate Moss will hear the case alone. At the same time, Jones stated that he is currently waiting for letters from the four Chinese detainees in Tianjin authorizing him to represent them in this legal matter. When Magistrate Jones rejected the petition for the writ at the British Consulate General here, he stated that the petition for a writ of habeas corpus must be made by the prisoner and supported by an affidavit authorizing someone to act as their representative. This affidavit is expected to arrive immediately. The merits of this petition will be debated in the London Court Office today, and then a decision will be made as to whether a writ should be issued. Judge Cassel may be listening. Action will be taken here only after the decision made in London is known.</p>
<h3>Yan Huiqing Went to Hong Kong Three Months Ago to Attend the Pacific Institute</h3>
<p>Former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Yan Huiqing came to Shanghai from Hong Kong last month to recuperate. According to diplomatic sources, Mr. Yan and his daughter traveled from Shanghai to Hong Kong by ship three months ago. His task was to attend the Canadian session of the Pacific Institute. The Pacific Institute is a joint organization of countries related to the Pacific, and has branches in various countries. The discussions in previous sessions have all been about important issues related to the politics and economics of the Pacific countries. Although it is an academic organization, countries around the world pay close attention to this conference. Governments of various countries also attach great importance to it.</p>
<h3>Commemoration of League of Youth Members Surviving an Accident: Banquet to Be Held at the East Asia Restaurant Tonight</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, a bombing tragedy occurred at the East Asia Restaurant of Sincere Company on Nanjing Road. At that time, eight former members of the League of Youth were dining at the restaurant, discussing ways to assist refugees. They were seriously injured by the bombing. Fortunately, they were treated properly and all recovered. Now, the League is commemorating the second anniversary of the accident, and has set tonight at 7:00 PM to hold a dinner at the original location of the East Asia Restaurant to commemorate the event. In addition to the eight members who survived the accident, many other members, relatives, and friends will participate.</p>

<h3>The Isolated Army Incident in Shanghai: Previously Agreed to by the Japanese; Food and Expenses to Be Borne by the Chinese Government; Japanese Accuse Ignorance of the Intended Purpose</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reports that a reporter inquired with officials yesterday (the 21st) about the Isolated Army incident. It was stated that on November 1, 1937, the day after the Isolated Army was detained by the Public Concession Bureau, the Bureau sent identical letters to the Consular Corps and the Japanese Consulate, informing them of the Bureau's decision to detain these soldiers and that the Chinese government would bear the cost of their upkeep until the end of the Sino-Japanese War. In a surprisingly short period of time, a reply was received notifying the Public Concession Bureau that they fully agreed to the detention. In this regard, the Japanese Consul General, as a member of the Consular Corps, not only replied on behalf of his own consulate, but also did not object to the Consular Corps' reply to the Public Concession Bureau. It is noted that taxpaying Japanese have recently accused the Public Concession Bureau of assisting in the maintenance of the Isolated Army, threatening them with non-payment of taxes. Regarding this point, officials also stated that the Chinese government is fully responsible for all expenses.</p>
<h3>Foreigners Receive Private Notice: Do Not Go to Tianjin for the Time Being; Shortage of Supplies; Danger Not Yet Abated</h3>
<p>According to private sources among foreigners, they have received notification from Tianjin that since the lockdown, there has been a shortage of food and various supplies, and the danger has not abated. They are urged not to rashly go to Tianjin at this time.</p>
<h3>Automatic Subsidies in the North-South Groceries Industry: Stabilizing the Lives of Employees; Increasing Efficiency</h3>
<p>Since the sudden devaluation of the black market exchange rate, the prices of all goods have soared, especially oil, rice, and food. The general salaried class has been hit the hardest and is constantly complaining. Therefore, there have been requests for pay raises to seek relief. Understanding employers, in order to stabilize the lives of their employees, are mostly happy to accept. Some have also voluntarily provided subsidies without waiting for requests from the labor side. The following is a record of what has been seen and heard, as a reference for various industries:</p>
<p>Xin Yuan Feng Incense Shop</p>
<p>The owner of the Xin Yuan Feng Incense Shop on East Xin Bridge, Avenue Edward VII, recognizing that the price of rice has soared and the lives of all employees are difficult, has decided that starting from August, regardless of rank, each person will receive a rice subsidy of 5 yuan per month in addition to their original salary. Apprentices will continue to receive an additional subsidy of one yuan until the price of rice returns to normal.</p>
<p>North Goods Industry Association</p>
<p>Qiu Yangzhi, chairman of the Shanghai North Goods Industry Association, Zheng Changgeng, and Lu Wenbin, members of the Standing Committee, recognizing the difficult lives of the association's employees, have voluntarily increased their salaries by 20% starting this month to stabilize their lives and increase their efficiency in handling matters. This move sets an example for others and deserves attention.</p>
<p>Sugar and Sea United Market</p>
<p>The salaries of all employees of the Shanghai North-South Groceries Industry United Market on Tongyun Street, Xiaodongmen, will also be subsidized appropriately starting this month to maintain the status quo.</p>
<h3>Sand and Gravel Detained in Wusong: Have Been Transported to Shanghai Through Circuitous Routes; Panic in the Construction Industry Has Been Roughly Resolved; But the Soaring Prices of Materials Make Construction Extremely Difficult</h3>
<p>More than 30 sand transport ships in this city, loaded with yellow sand and gravel from the islands of Si Jiao and Sheng Shan, were transported to Shanghai for sale. However, when they passed through Wusong, they were forcibly detained by steamships sent by the puppet "Jiangnan Sand and Gravel Company," forcing them to dock in the Zhanghuabang and Yunzaobang area, resulting in the interruption of the source of sand and gravel in the Shanghai concession, soaring market prices, and the construction industry being severely affected. It is now known that various gangs, due to the urgent need for sand in Shanghai, transported the sand to Shanghai through circuitous routes at night to supply the needs of various construction industries. Currently, with the gradual increase in the supply of sand and gravel, market prices have also fallen slightly, and the panic in the construction industry regarding sand and gravel has been roughly resolved.</p>
<p>Contract Quotations Have Been Affected</p>
<p>The Shanghai Construction Industry Association has stated that with the recent devaluation of foreign exchange rates and the soaring prices of building materials, the prices for contracted house construction previously agreed upon are now twice as high compared to the current prices of materials, making it impossible to fulfill the contracts. Yesterday, a public announcement was made to various industry leaders to request ways to remedy the situation. The original text read: "We hereby inform you that members of our association have reported that recently, foreign exchange rates have plummeted, prices of all goods have skyrocketed, and financial panic has reached its peak, which can be described as an unprecedented catastrophe. Most of the raw materials required by our industry come from overseas, and the impact has been greater than in other industries. Even domestic raw materials, in addition to being affected by foreign exchange rates, have also doubled in price due to special circumstances. Labor costs will also increase in the near future. Withdrawals from banks are limited by the restrictions set by the Ministry of Finance code, and the contraction has reached its extreme.</p>
<p>Unable to Stop and Unable to Advance</p>
<p>My colleagues and others calculate all contracted projects based on the financial situation and the price of goods at that time. This sudden and extraordinary change makes it impossible to stop and unable to advance. We are anxious and frightened. Therefore, we have no choice but to appeal to the public officials of the association to find ways to remedy the situation, study the matter carefully, and find a solution that takes into account both legal and emotional considerations and benefits both the public and private sectors, so that our colleagues can have something to follow, which would be a blessing for the industry and a blessing for society, etc. After reviewing the above-mentioned claims of the members, the situation is indeed real. This financial crisis cannot be attributed to any party and is actually an unavoidable event.</p>
<p>Hoping That Owners Will Understand</p>
<p>The only solution is to hope that the owners can understand the special circumstances of the environment, understand the hardships of their colleagues, take into account the facts, and find an appropriate solution so that there is no conflict with both law and emotion, and that both the public and private sectors can get their due. Although our association is an industry association, we are concerned about the general financial security, so we dare not be presumptuous and express the real situation and appeal to the owners on behalf of our colleagues, and we dare to hope for understanding."</p>
<p>Construction Bamboo and Wood Are Still Prohibited Items</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government approved Commander Gu's telegram on behalf of the Military Commission, citing a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, stating that although bamboo was originally designated as a prohibited item, the Executive Yuan later revised the original method, and bamboo and wood were only restricted to those suitable for construction. Those not suitable for construction will be released. Informing subordinates to take note, etc. The provincial government has transferred and instructed all counties and relevant agencies to take note.</p>
<h3>Robbing Vegetables Transported to Shanghai at the Intersection of Hongqiao Road and Zhongshan Road; Forcibly Dragging Vegetable Vendors Onto Cars and Escorting Them to Hongkou for Sale; Vegetables from Pudong Have Been Controlled by the Hongkou Market</h3>
<p>Regarding the abandonment of the Japanese attempt to control vegetables from Pudong due to concerns, incidents of Japanese intercepting vegetable vendors and transporting them to Hongkou have reoccurred at the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai. Since the 20th of this month, four or five Japanese people have been standing guard at the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Zhongshan Road from 4-5 am to 7-8 am and from 2 pm to 6 pm. Next to them is a truck. Whenever they see a vegetable vendor entering the concession from China, they forcibly take the vegetables and fruits they are carrying and load them into the truck, and</p>
<p>Four Vegetable Vendors</p>
<p>(limited to four people) are forcibly dragged into the car and whisked into Hongkou. One thing worth noting is that the Japanese soldiers stationed there do not interfere and even inform the vegetable vendors to seek other routes. As for the vegetable vendors who accompany the trucks into Hongkou, it is not yet known what they get for their wares and where they are taken. Inquiries with people in the ground cargo industry reveal that this has indeed been witnessed and is expected to be</p>
<p>unknown to the Japanese Military</p>
<p>authorities, similar to the recent incident of controlling vegetables in Pudong. It is also understood that around the Baziqiao area of ​​Zhabei Dachang, the Japanese sent 3,000 Taiwanese migrants last spring to occupy the homes of the people in the area to plant fruits and vegetables. The yield is very abundant, but it is exclusively for the needs of the Japanese troops and various units. If there is a surplus, they are sent to the Hongkou market for sale. Chinese people who want to return home to manage their old businesses are charged rent by the Taiwanese.</p>
<p>Cuckoo Occupies Magpie's Nest</p>
<p>It is also reported that Pudong has begun to force vegetable vendors to transport their vegetable loads to the Hongkou market, transfer them to concession vegetable vendors, and collect commissions from them. Another method is to weigh the vegetable loads passing through the Hongkou market and extract donations, but they are still allowed to sell in the concession.</p>
<h3>Collecting Tolls in the Hongqiao District; Japanese Soldiers Stop Cars Yesterday; Demanding Five Dimes per Car</h3>
<p>The English Da Mei Evening News reports that this morning (the 22nd), drivers of cars in the Hongqiao district were surprised to see two Japanese soldiers at the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Warren Road stopping cars and asking for five dimes per car. The day before yesterday, "Great Way" police officers were stationed in the area, but they were asking for one yuan per car. This fact is a mystery, as these roads are owned and maintained by the Public Concession Bureau. Now they are asking for "road repair fees." The Public Concession Bureau and the consular authorities are</p>
<p>studying this matter</p>
<p>and have taken no action. From last night until 9:00 am this morning, no tax collectors were seen by those surprised drivers passing through the area. They seem to go to "work" whenever they want. According to someone living in the Hongqiao district, the tax collectors earned no more than twenty yuan yesterday, because they did not try to stop all passing cars. This morning, a Japanese tax collector was asked why he only collected five dimes instead of one yuan. He replied that someone in Shanghai had strongly protested the collection of this tax, saying that the road belonged to the Public Concession Bureau. The Japanese felt it was inappropriate to collect one yuan, so today</p>
<p>only half the amount is collected</p>
<p>and the other half is left for the Public Concession Bureau to collect. According to the Zi Lin Bao, a British expatriate was driving along Warren Road near Hongqiao Road not long after noon yesterday (the 21st). Because he refused to pay the "fee" of one yuan, he was threatened by a "Great Way" policeman with a box cannon. The British expatriate knew that if he did not pay the "fee" and continued to drive west, he would risk his life, so he drove back to the Public Concession. According to the British expatriate, there were</p>
<p>three "Great Way" police officers</p>
<p>stationed at the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Warren Road, stopping cars going west. As soon as the car stopped, a person in plain clothes handed the driver a printed English notice stating that starting from noon yesterday, cars passing by must pay a "fee" of one yuan. The money collected will be used for road repairs. Others who drove by were also stopped and, after paying the amount demanded, received a receipt allowing them to continue driving without being harassed. The receipt is valid for one day and can be used to</p>
<p>drive arbitrarily</p>
<p>any number of times on that day without having to pay again. Yesterday, an official from the Public Concession Bureau, in answering an inquiry about the matter, said that the two roads are outside the boundary and are now occasionally repaired by the Works Department of the Public Concession Bureau. He went to the two roads yesterday evening and saw that the road surface was in excellent condition.</p>
<p>It is not the first time</p>
<p>that the "Great Way" authorities have attempted to collect "fees" from those who use the roads built and maintained by the Public Concession Bureau. However, on several previous occasions, the "Great Way" authorities have stopped their attempts when the Public Concession Bureau has taken action. It was the first time yesterday that a foreign expatriate was actually threatened with a gun by a "Great Way" policeman. Since the Japanese army occupied the Hongqiao district, the police station has not exercised its duties in the area.</p>
<h3>Circulating Stamps: Post Office Decides on Measures; Slightly Damaged Stamps May Be Accepted for Use; No Consideration Will Be Given to Recall</h3>
<p>Since the news was released that the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank would issue 1-cent, 5-cent, and fraction-of-a-cent banknotes starting from the 23rd, the use of stamps in the market was thought to be coming to an end. Yesterday, it was learned that the issuance of these fractional banknotes has been postponed, and stamps will continue to be used as usual. Regarding the already circulating stamps, the postal bureau has specific measures for their handling. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Post Office Decisions on Stamp Disposal</p>
<p>Although the post office has received letters of recommendation from various organizations in this city, it places greater emphasis on the three recommendations from the Chamber of Commerce. After deliberation and decision by Mr. Tharpelin, the Shanghai Postmaster, the post office will accept and implement one point: that slightly damaged stamps, within a possible range, will be accepted for use and no penalties will be imposed. However, regarding the issue of recall, it was stated that there would be no consideration whatsoever. Mr. Tharpelin has officially replied to the Chamber of Commerce regarding the above decision. Furthermore, according to the person in charge of the bureau, the post office has no intention of submitting further requests to the Directorate General of Posts, as it is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce to Request Government Recall</p>
<p>According to news from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber has received a formal reply from the Shanghai Postal Administration regarding the three recommendations it made to the postal bureau. The Chamber believes that the inability of the post office to recall damaged stamps held by peddlers is of great concern to the livelihoods of the poor. Therefore, it will continue to make requests to government agencies. However, the target and method of the request will be decided by the committee.</p>
<p>Commoners and Peddlers Petition Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Regarding the stamp issue in this city, no definitive solution has been reached. The commercial community, on the one hand, believes that the Central Bank is about to issue fractional banknotes. On the other hand, cigarette and exchange shops and residents returned much of their collection of one-cent copper coins yesterday. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, thirty to forty commoners and peddlers gathered in front of the Directorate General of Posts, claiming that they demanded to be received by the authorities in order to exchange stamps for cash. Fortunately, after gentle persuasion by the postal authorities and the dispatch of detectives by the police, no incidents occurred, and they dispersed.</p>
<h3>Krogh's Remains to Be Cremated Today; Developments in the Case; A Conclusion May Have Been Reached</h3>
<p>H.P. Krogh, the Danish head of the business department of the Great Northern Telegraph Company on Avenue Edward VII and captain of Company A of the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteer Corps, was suddenly shot dead by two thugs in Western suits on the morning of last Friday (the 18th) at around 8:20 AM as he drove his car out of the carport at his residence on Anhe Temple Road. The Public Security Bureau of the Public Concession is closely monitoring this matter but remains silent. They have only requested ballistics experts to conduct a thorough analysis of the two bullets. It is heard that the authorities have made some discoveries, and it is generally believed that a definite conclusion may have been reached. Mr. Krogh's wife and one-year-old son were vacationing in Beidaihe. After hearing the bad news, they took a special trip back to Shanghai on Jardine Matheson's ship "Taishan" and arrived here yesterday afternoon. However, Mr. Krogh's funeral was completed the day before yesterday (the 21st) at 4:30 PM, presided over by the International Settlement Volunteer Corps. It is heard that the cremation ceremony for Mr. Krogh's remains is scheduled for 5:30 PM this afternoon at the Western Cemetery on Jing'an Temple Road. In addition to his wife presiding over the ceremony, all members of Company A of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps and other officers will participate. Mr. Krogh was 39 years old and was born in Jutland, Denmark, in 1900. He was transferred to Shanghai by the headquarters of the Great Northern Telegraph Company in 1928. His wife is British. Mr. Krogh was a member of the Shanghai Club and the French Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3>Adulterous Monk; Woman Absconds with Money and is Arrested; Tearfully Confesses to Being Deceived by Lascivious Monk; Public Prosecution for Embezzlement of 10,000 Yuan Will Be Filed Separately</h3>
<p>Yang Yunwu, a native of Gaoyou who once served as a county magistrate during the warlord era, is 50 years old. Because he accumulated hundreds of thousands of yuan during his time in office, he extensively acquired concubines and lived as a rentier in Shanghai. After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, Yang moved his family to No. 9 Shengde Lane on Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession, neighboring the Leshan Temple. Yang has a concubine named Sun Lanzhen, 35 years old this year, also a native of Gaoyou, who has been married to Yang for 16 years. Because she has lost her beauty and favor, the monk Wanyuan of Leshan Temple, because he and Sun Lanzhen</p>
<p>Saw Each Other Morning and Night</p>
<p>Did not disdain her as a broken branch or remaining leaf. The two unexpectedly formed an inseparable bond. This spring, Yang again moved his family to No. 3, Lane 44, Rue Raoul-Follereau. Sun Lanzhen and the monk Wanyuan still frequently visited each other, but feeling inconvenienced, on the tenth day of the fourth lunar month, Sun Lanzhen took more than 6,000 yuan in cash and gold jewelry and fled without a trace. After his concubine fled, Yang reported it to the French Concession police for investigation. Last month, Wang Changchun, a detective of the French police, arrested the monk Wanyuan and confiscated embroidered pillowcases and other stolen goods. He was sent to the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court and has already been tried and sentenced to</p>
<p>Six Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Sun Lanzhen had been hiding at No. 2, Lane 2, Roberts Road, until she was arrested by the French Concession police the day before yesterday. Yesterday, she was brought to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, requesting detention for investigation. Judge Qiu Huanying took the bench to interrogate her. The defendant, Sun Lanzhen, stood before the court in tears, claiming to be 35 years old, from Gaoyou, and that her husband, Yang Yunwu, was a government official. She has been in the Yang family for 16 years, and the relationship between husband and concubine has always been good. This was because of the move to Leshan Temple due to the war, neighboring the old monk. Because of a moment of confusion, she had an infamous affair with the monk Wanyuan of Leshan Temple. Later,</p>
<p>Wanyuan Incited</p>
<p>Her to run away, so she took 2,500 yuan in cash, three jade bracelets, six gold rings, and several leather suitcases. She first stayed with Monk Wanyuan at the Baxian Hotel. After five days, they went to Hangzhou Temple to stay for ten days, then returned to Shanghai and stayed at the Oriental Hotel. The gold bracelets and gold rings were all taken by Wanyuan. As for the 2,500 yuan in cash, 2,000 yuan was taken by Wanyuan, supposedly to lend to his master, Monk Qinliang, to mortgage the Leshan Temple property. Unexpectedly, Monk Wanyuan has already been arrested and imprisoned, causing me to have</p>
<p>Nowhere to Live</p>
<p>I was completely deceived by the old monk. At this point, Sun Lanzhen pulled her own daughter and cried bitterly, asking for mother and daughter reunion. Yang Yunwu also requested leniency from the court. Judge Qiu reviewed the testimony and ordered that the defendant, Sun Lanzhen, be detained and re-examined on the 29th of this month. As for the monk Wanyuan, the French police will file additional charges of instigating theft.</p>
<h3>Chen Maochang of Shaodian Was Chopped Six Times with an Ax</h3>
<p>Chen Maochang, 30 years old, from Shaodian, lived at No. 557 Xinzha Road. At around 7 PM last night, Chen was walking past the entrance of the Quan'an Teahouse on Xinzha Bridge Road when suddenly a dozen people swarmed forward and stopped him. One of them pulled out a sharp ax and, without asking any questions, chopped him six times: twice on the back, twice on the left thigh, and twice on the right calf. He fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Afterwards, Chinese constable No. 1651 stepped forward and arrested one of the perpetrators. An ambulance was called to take Chen to Shilong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>A Careless Fire at a Tung Oil Factory on Jessfield Road Spreads to More Than Ten Neighboring Factories</h3>
<p>A careless fire suddenly broke out at the Fuxing Tung Oil Factory at No. 1486, Lane Jessfield Road. Because tung oil is extremely flammable, it quickly became uncontrollable. After vigorous firefighting efforts, it was extinguished after two hours. As a result, in addition to the complete destruction of the factory, the fire spread to as many as sixteen or seventeen neighboring factory buildings. Even two flower sheds at the back door of the Zhaofeng Huakai in front of the factory were affected.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Falsely Reports Robbery; Arrested After Exposure</h3>
<p>It was reported that Yongheng Money Exchange at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Shandong Road sent an apprentice to deliver funds at around 10 AM yesterday. A total of more than 2,800 yuan was wrapped in cloth and carried out. Unexpectedly, it had already been coveted by bandits waiting outside the door. As soon as the person came out, one bandit wearing a suit and holding a pistol and another bandit wearing short clothes grabbed him, ordered him to keep quiet, and forced him to get into a car parked on the side of the road, speeding south and turning into the French Concession. When the car reached Rue de Consulat, the bandit with the gun took out a handkerchief and blindfolded the man, pushing him out of the car. The bandits drove away in the original car. The victim could not recall the car number or any other details. He immediately reported the incident to the French police, who transferred it to the Public Concession police for investigation. However, after investigation, it was learned that the case was purely fabricated by the apprentice, who had intentionally made a false report. The apprentice has been detained and will be sent to court for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Resolution of Dispute Over Dumping Excrement</h3>
<p>The disposal of garbage in the entire French Concession had been delayed due to threats from the puppet authorities to increase subsidies, requiring 80,000 yuan per year. Before the war, all garbage in the French Concession was transported by barge to Punan and Xinlonghua for disposal, with the contractor subsidizing the former municipal authorities 20,000 yuan per year for sanitation fees. It is now learned that the negotiations between the two parties have been resolved and a contract has been signed. The annual subsidy to the puppet authorities is still written as 80,000 yuan in legal tender, but in reality, it only costs 60,000 yuan. Garbage dumping has resumed to its original state since noon on the 22nd.</p>
<p>In addition, the excrement from the two concessions was also innocently obstructed due to the Japanese puppet authorities' prohibition of garbage dumping, claiming it to be related to sanitation. All ships from farmers in the suburbs coming to Shanghai to purchase excrement fertilizer were cut off, causing a stench and chaos. Fortunately, the excrement contractor managed to sell it at the manure factory. Now that the garbage dumping subsidy issue has been signed and resolved, restoring the original state, farmers in the four surrounding villages can also freely come to Shanghai to purchase artificial fertilizer. However, the excrement contractor secretly suffered considerable losses.</p>
<h3>Fire at North Railway Station Warehouse; Japanese Claim Arson Again</h3>
<p>The Huazhong Railway Warehouse established by the Japanese at the North Railway Station in Zhabei suddenly caught fire on the morning of the day before yesterday (the 20th). The fire was extinguished after being fought. It is estimated that 18 bales of stored silk cocoons were burned. Afterwards, the Japanese claimed that the fire must have been caused by arsonists and strictly prohibited all coolies from entering or leaving, questioning them one by one. However, there were no clues, so the investigation is still ongoing.</p>
<h3>Owner of Sanguantang Excrement Wharf Shot Yesterday; Yao Xinwei Shot in the Waist</h3>
<p>Yao Xinwei, 46 years old, from Gaoyou, who runs the Sanguantang excrement wharf in western Shanghai, was shot in the waist at around 10:30 AM yesterday. Yao, along with his three assistants, Sun Rongqing, Li Deqing, and Zhou Wanyou, were drinking tea at the Xinle Teahouse at No. 426 Rue Robert-Follereau. At that time, a young man approached Yao's table and opened fire on Yao. Afterwards, Sun Li and others took Yao by car to the Red Cross Hospital. The reason for the shooting is currently unknown.</p>
<h3>Swallow Stomach Pain Powder; Unexpectedly Dies</h3>
<p>Li Zhanfeng (30 years old), from Shandong, was a cook at the Race Club at No. 30, Lane 629, Racecourse Road. Chen suffered from stomach pain and bought a box of liver and stomach pain powder from a Chinese pharmacy the day before yesterday and brought it home. After taking it at home yesterday afternoon, he immediately experienced abdominal pain, vomited white foam, and fainted. His family urgently hired a car to take him to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Before reaching the hospital, he had already died. The remaining liver and stomach pain powder was also taken to the hospital by his family for a doctor to examine.</p>
<h3>Father Imprisoned for Secretly Hiding Military Firepower; Adopted Son Arrested for Theft</h3>
<p>Wang Ronggen, an 18-year-old from Tongzhou, residing at No. 216 Gansu Road, worked at Yihua Packing Factory. Recently, he associated with bad friends, whoring and gambling, squandering money. Between July 28th and the 19th of this month, he stole 180 yuan in legal tender and a bicycle worth 85 yuan from his mother, Wang Yan's, home, pawning them for cash. When she discovered this, she twisted her son Wang Ronggen over to the Chinese constable on duty, who took him to the Huishi police station and detained him. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted him for theft, stating that the defendant's father, Wang Shichang, had been sentenced to eight months in prison for carrying military firepower and was serving his sentence, and that the defendant was Wang Yan's adopted son, not her biological son. Judge Huang interrogated Wang Ronggen briefly and ordered him to be detained and the case re-examined at a later date.</p>
<h3>Further Suspect Arrested in the Case of the Murder of the Owner of the Yilun Silk Factory; Remanded for Trial Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Xue A'ren (also known as Wenlong), the owner of the Yilun Silk Factory in Butterfly Bridge, Wuxi, was kidnapped by bandits in the factory on March 25th of this year. Because no one negotiated a ransom, he was bound with hemp rope and shot dead by the bandits next to a tomb in the wilderness on the afternoon of the 28th of the same month. His wife, Xue Dai, heard the news and went to identify the body at the location. She was also shot in the left temple of her head, but fortunately the bullet did not injure the skull, so she escaped death. On the morning of the 6th of this month, Xue Dai came to Shanghai and happened to encounter the murderer of her husband, Hou Genxiang, hiding in the Liangxi Hotel in Hubei Road. She reported it to the Laoza Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest Hou and send him to the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, where he was prosecuted for murder under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The defendant also admitted the crime. The court ordered him to be detained for further trial after submitting it to the Supreme Court to designate jurisdiction. In this case, the police, based on the confession of an accomplice, went to No. 1, Lane 788, Marlborough Road yesterday (the 21st) morning with personnel from the Legal Police Department and arrested another suspect, Yuan Keqing (30 years old, unemployed) from Wuxi. He was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Special First Court yesterday morning, requesting detention. Judge Feng presided over the trial and interrogated him briefly before ordering him to be detained for review.</p>
<h3>Claim for Compensation by Victims in the Case of Eight Deaths in Fire on Rue Cardinal Mercier; Arsonist Zhang Bingsheng Makes Excuses</h3>
<p>The Kuailelin Film Company at No. 6 Renchang Lane, Rue Cardinal Mercier, was destroyed by fire due to carelessness at around 4:00 PM on the 5th of this month, burning eight tenants to death. After the case occurred, Zhang Bingsheng, the owner of the Kuailelin Film Company, was sued by the French Concession administrative authorities in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court for causing death by negligence. The family members of the victims, Zhang Baotang's lawyer, also commissioned Huang Jiyuan's lawyer to appear in court, filing an incidental private prosecution requesting that the defendant Zhang Bingsheng be ordered to pay damages of more than 7,400 yuan. After Judge Miao Aibang summoned and ordered the defendant Zhang Bingsheng several times to pay 8,000 yuan in bail to be released and await trial, etc., it has been repeatedly recorded in previous reports. Judge Miao opened the First Criminal Division again yesterday to continue the trial. The defendant Zhang Bingsheng insisted on claiming that he was away on business when the fire broke out and requested leniency. However, the family members of the victims, Zhang Baotang and others, insisted that the defendant Zhang Bingsheng was guilty of negligence in his business and disregard for public safety by not properly storing flammable films, resulting in this fire that killed eight people, requesting that he be punished according to law. The court reviewed the testimony and ordered a debate, announcing the conclusion of the trial and setting the sentence for the 26th of this month. The defendant remained on his original bail.</p>
<h3>Shen A'biao Posted Bail in the Assault Case at Yuanshang Lane; Trial Set for Sentencing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Morphine king Shen A'biao (i.e., "Pockmarked" A'biao), at the instigation of Zhang Xiaomao, a driver currently working for the Hu Mansion, led dozens of hooligans, including female hooligan Yang Ye and the fugitive robber Lao San, etc., each holding wooden sticks and knives, to the home of Xie Dejun, the owner of the Lao Zhengxing Restaurant on Yunnan Road, at No. 1 Yuanshang Lane, Dongzilaihuo Street, at around 4:00 PM on the 5th of this month, assaulting Xie without asking any questions, seriously injuring Xie's partner, Li Binghuan, and destroying all the furniture in Xie's room, opening the boxes and leaving with a whoop. Afterwards, the French Police Department dispatched detectives and captured six perpetrators, including Shen A'biao, at the Qunleju Teahouse and other places. However, the principal offender, Zhang Xiaomao, had already fled upon hearing the news. Only his wife, Zhang Chen, was arrested and brought to the police station for interrogation in the Second Special District Court. Yesterday, Judge Qiu reopened the trial in this case and, after summoning and interrogating each of them, the defense lawyer Yue Junwei, hired by the defendants, and the private prosecution lawyer Zhang Fukang debated each other. The court, finding the case clear, announced that sentencing would be set for the 29th of this month and that the defendants would be released on their original bail.</p>
<h3>Epidemic Shows Signs of Spreading Rampantly; Citizens Urged to Pay Close Attention</h3>
<p>Within the three days of the 18th, 19th, and 20th of this month, the Hongkou Epidemic Hospital at the intersection of Singapore Road and Jiaozhou Road successively discovered three cases of true cholera: Wen A'yu, a 20-year-old from Zhenjiang, who lived at No. 600 Haifang Road, Singapore Road and worked as a telephone repairman; Zhang Jiangquan, a 37-year-old from Huzhou, who lived at No. 20, Lane 1121, Xinzha Road and worked as a silk merchant; and Ji Yinsheng, an 8-year-old from Nantong, who lived in the first lane west of the bus company on Connaught Road. The excrement of each of these patients was sent to the Public Works Department's Health Department for examination and confirmed to be true cholera. It can be seen that the epidemic in this city is showing a trend of becoming more rampant. It is essential to find ways to eradicate it as soon as possible. It is hoped that residents of this city will regulate their diet and not indulge in their appetites in order to maintain their health.</p>
<h3>Rising Prices at Boiled Water Stalls; One Copper Coin Buys Only One Ladle of Boiling Water</h3>
<p>The trend of rising prices in all industries in Shanghai is sweeping through the city, and the lives of residents are severely threatened. The soaring prices of essential foods and daily necessities have had a significant impact. Starting today, the boiling water stalls in all concessions of Shanghai are also raising prices due to rising fuel costs. Previously, one copper coin could buy three ladles of boiling water, or two ladles. This has now been reduced to one ladle. At the same time, fellow traders are warned not to lower prices privately.</p>

<h3>Zhongnan Hotel: Destroying Prostitution Dens</h3>
<p>The Public Concession police have been making unremitting efforts to search for prostitution and gambling dens in major hotels in the district recently. After searching the Central Hotel at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Zhejiang Road the night before last, yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 PM, a large number of Chinese and Western detectives rushed to the Zhongnan Hotel at the intersection of East Xinjiao Bridge, Avenue Edward VII, to search. As a result, three large prostitution dens were uncovered in rooms such as No. 210 on the second floor, No. 421 and No. 510 on the fourth floor. At that time, the rooms were filled with opium smokers and mahjong gamblers. Only the den owner, the opium den helpers, and more than a dozen opium smokers who were lying in bed eating opium were taken to the Laoza Police Station along with the opium lamps, opium pipes, and opium dross, where they are being detained for further investigation.</p>

Afterwards, Ma was arrested and also detained Cao Hanqing and Cao Tan, suspected of receiving stolen goods. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Feng Shide concluded the trial and sentenced Ma Qingyuan to nine years of imprisonment for being a habitual offender of armed robbery. The stolen foreign currency of 773 yuan was returned to the owner, and Cao Hanqing and Cao Tan were found not guilty.</p>
<h3>Female Worker Sues Chauffeur for Assault; He Liying Files Lawsuit</h3>
<p>He Liying, a woman who works in a cigarette factory in Hongkou, was walking home from work on the 27th of last month when she was stopped and harassed by several workers from a motorcar company on North Jiangxi Road. She retorted and cursed, and they became enraged, assaulting her. She managed to grab one of them, but because there were no visible injuries, passersby mediated and the situation dispersed. Later, when she returned home, she felt a dull pain in her chest that worsened day by day. After consulting a doctor, she learned that the ribs on her chest were seriously bruised and would require long-term treatment to recover. Unable to afford the long-term treatment fees, she told her father, who investigated and learned that the assailants were Zhang Arong and others. She filed a lawsuit against Zhang in the First Special District Court, seeking more than 400 yuan in compensation for medical expenses and other costs. The trial opened yesterday afternoon, but Zhang did not attend. The court ordered a retrial at a later date.</p>
<h3>Autumn Tiger Shows Its Power</h3>
<p>The weather in Shanghai has turned hot in the past few days. The Fahrenheit thermometer has often risen above 90 degrees, especially yesterday, when the maximum temperature rose to around 93 degrees from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM, resembling the climate of the dog days.

<h3>Haimen Middle School to Relocate Back to the Mainland</h3>
<p>Recently, prices in Shanghai have been soaring, and students from various places who come to Shanghai to study and reside are experiencing increasing difficulties in their lives.

<h3>Finance: Germany and the Soviet Union to Sign Non-Aggression Pact; Foreign Exchange Increasingly Loosening.</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's listed prices showed no increase or decrease. In the black market for British and American exchange rates, spot and current month conditions were mediocre, but market sentiment was still affected by the tense European situation. Hong Kong banks such as Hua Bank and Huashang continued to sell, and Western merchant Sassoon also came to sell, but HSBC's appetite was still good, so the initial momentum was only slightly firm and stable. After 10:30 AM, news suddenly broke from Reuters that Germany and the Soviet Union had agreed to sign a non-aggression pact. Everyone believed that this was beneficial to China, so the selling trend became even stronger. However, because HSBC was still buying spot at lower prices, the loosening trend was blocked. The highest British gold price was 3/8 d., to 31.25, and the lowest US dollar price was 6.875. The market closed at 3/8 d. and 6.8125. September futures, in general, the bulls were increasingly panicked and competed to sell. Some banks, which had opened with buying prices in the morning, had become firm again at British gold 3/8 d. 1875 and US dollars 6.1875. Later, due to news that Germany and the Soviet Union would sign an agreement, the loosening trend became even sharper. One bank once bought US dollars at the extremely low price of 6.375, but the appetite of foreign banks such as Yuli was not weak, so the situation softened slightly. In the end, it was slightly looser than the previous day, at 1/8, and the US dollar also hardened by 25. Therefore, the swap for August and September saw a squeeze. According to the evening closing price, the British gold difference was 2.96875, and the US dollar difference was 5.9375. However, one bank was only willing to post half a yuan for the US dollar, which is equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commissions) of about 8%. Trading was still active throughout the day. It was also reported that due to the chaotic European situation, Chinese and Western merchants mostly conducted transactions through neutral country banks.</p>
<p>Bulls Panicked and Sold</p>
<p>The morning opening saw London gold close to four and a quarter higher for both near and far. New York silver prices rose sharply by 1.25. London raw gold remained flat. Exchange rates: British against US shrank by 1 hao, against French a slight increase of 1 centime, against Shanghai a significant increase of 0.0625. US against British/Shanghai remained flat, against French a rise of 0.0625. Central government listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Bank opening prices for spot exchange in the morning: British gold 3/8 d. 46875, US dollars 6.75, with no rise or fall compared to the previous closing. After the opening, market conditions were calm and trading was quiet. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, there were no increases or decreases, and the silver balance tax was still exempted. After this, Hong Kong telegraphed to sell, estimated to sell spot British gold to foreign banks like HSBC for 3/8 d. and spot US dollars for 8.125. Then Huashang and Western merchant Sassoon successively sold to foreign banks such as Yuli and a certain American bank this month's British gold for 3/8 d. 46875 and half d., and this month's US dollars for 75 and 8.125. The process was extremely stable. Around 10:30 AM, Reuters reported that Germany and the Soviet Union had agreed to sign a non-aggression treaty. In addition, Chinese merchants were inclined to sell, causing the market to be firm, with the March futures even looser. Foreign merchants sold to foreign banks like HSBC spot British gold at 3/8 d. 53125 at different times and spot US dollars also hardened to 6.875. Later, Huashang bought from foreign banks September US dollars originally at 6.25, eventually soaring to 375. Approaching noon, the situation turned flat. Bank spot selling prices at noon close: British gold 3/8 d. and US dollars 6.8125. It was heard that it was difficult to settle at this price after closing.</p>
<p>September US Dollars Sold at 6 Yuan</p>
<p>In the afternoon, because Hong Kong telegraphed to sell again and Chinese banks also had intentions to sell, the market was stable and firm. It is estimated that Chinese banks and Hong Kong telegrams successively sold to foreign banks such as HSBC spot British gold at 3/8 d. and 53125, and spot US dollars at 6.8125. Later, Huashang yarn and cloth dealers also sold September US dollars to foreign banks such as Yuli for 6.1875 and 25. At that time, a certain American bank was selling September US dollars at 6.3125, without interest in buying. Extending to the evening close, bank spot selling prices: British gold 3/8 d., US dollars 6.825, this month 3/8 d. 484375, US dollars 6.78125, September British gold 3/8 d. 1875, US dollars 6.1875. As a result, compared to the previous day, spot British was slightly looser at 0.03125, US was slightly harder at 0.0625, this month's British was cheaper at 0.015625, US was more expensive at 0.03125, September British was looser at 1/8, US was harder at 25.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Investors Buy on Dips; Gold Prices Unlikely to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold spot market was lackluster, with no significant changes on the day, but volatility remained. Prices generally rose first, then fell, and then fluctuated. Initially, Hong Kong investors were strong buyers, and with a relatively stable foreign exchange trend, sellers were weak. The price briefly rose to 4,585 yuan. Subsequently, news broke from Reuters that Germany and the Soviet Union had agreed to sign a non-aggression pact, causing external demand to ease. This led to a wave of selling in the market, and with a temporary lack of support, the price plunged to a low of 4,500 yuan. However, securities firms quickly bought aggressively on the dip, and by noon, the price had rebounded to 4,560 yuan. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange market showed some strength, causing many buyers to hesitate. Additionally, some money exchange houses successively offered to sell, causing the price to fall again to 4,530 yuan. Ultimately, the market closed at 4,535 yuan, a further decrease of 10 yuan from the previous day. However, operators continued to focus on the trends in European and domestic political situations, and trading remained active, at around 1,000 taels. Silver jewelry prices remained unchanged throughout the day, and customs gold and Sino-British pure gold prices remained consistent.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Down Another 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The price per bar (ten taels) at the start of the morning was relatively stable. Money exchange houses initially sold ten taels to silver firms at a price of 4,540 yuan, which was 5 yuan lower than the previous closing price. After the opening, some silver firms bought on behalf of customers, and money exchange houses also showed buying interest, causing the price to rise by 30 yuan in a short time. Money exchange houses traded 30 taels among themselves at 4,570 yuan. At that time, silver firms and cash dealers frequently offered to sell, causing the price to fall by 20 yuan. Silver firms sold 30 taels to gold dealers at 4,550 yuan. Subsequently, some silver firms resumed buying, and some gold dealers and money exchange houses also bought first, causing the price to rebound. Before long, the price rose by 35 yuan. Money exchange houses sold 50 taels to silver firms at 4,585 yuan. After 10:30 am, news broke from Reuters that Germany and the Soviet Union would sign a non-aggression pact. At the same time, due to strong foreign exchange rates, market sentiment deteriorated. Buyers temporarily hesitated, and money exchange houses and retail investors turned from buying to selling. Cash dealers were particularly eager to sell, causing the price to plunge by 85 yuan. Money exchange houses traded 20 taels among themselves at a price of 4,500 yuan. Subsequently, after hearing that the foreign exchange market had stabilized, securities firms aggressively bought on the dip and quickly recovered 60 yuan. Securities firms sold 10 taels to silver firms at 4,560 yuan, the closing price for the morning session. The market opened 5 yuan lower in the afternoon. Money exchange houses sold 10 taels to gold dealers at 4,555 yuan. Later, after hearing that the foreign exchange market was stable with a slight upward trend, although some silver firms bought slightly, some money exchange houses were still eager to sell, causing the price to fall another 25 yuan. Money exchange houses traded 10 taels among themselves at 4,530 yuan. Afterwards, some silver firms bought another 20 taels from money exchange houses at 4,535 yuan, the closing price for the evening session. As a result, the price fell another 10 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 85 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash dealers' gold was 1,000 yuan higher than the spot gold price. The current bid price for gold was 65 yuan lower than the listed price, with few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Prices Remain Unchanged</p>
<p>The price of silver jewelry remained unchanged throughout the day. Da Tong Hang still quoted the original price of 460 yuan per tael, while Xin Tong Hang quoted 458 yuan. The purchasing price was reduced by about 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Sino-British Pure Gold Stable</p>
<p>London, August 21st, Reuters: The price of British pure gold remained stable at £7 8s 7d per ounce, causing the market prices of central banks to remain the same as the previous day.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts and bills decreased from high to low. The initial rate for each 1,000 yuan was close to the 200 yuan mark, but soon gradually fell. At noon, the rate was 195 yuan, and it remained stable in the afternoon, closing at 195 yuan, 2.5 yuan lower than the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Exchange Association remained unchanged, opening at 1.7 cents in both the morning and afternoon sessions.</p>
<h3>Pound Sterling Rises Alone</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of foreign currencies, including British, American, and gold pounds, was scarce. The British gold pound rose alone, while the American gold pound remained stable. However, British and American gold drafts decreased significantly due to the easing of foreign exchange rates and the fluctuating weakness of spot gold prices. Hong Kong drafts rose first and then fell, with no change in the final result. There was no demand for French francs and Annam piasters, and the market was weak. Australian gold and consignment drafts were weak, following the downward trend. There was strong demand for Japanese gold drafts, and the market was tight and expensive. Money exchange houses sold them at 1.20 yuan in the evening session. Korean piasters were very stable, selling for 1.01 yuan in the evening session. Other currencies remained stable. Yesterday's market prices were: British pound up 5 jiao, British gold drafts down 1.5 yuan, American gold drafts down 2 jiao, French franc drafts down 1.2 li, Annam piasters down 1.5 jiao, Australian gold drafts down 1 yuan, and other currencies unchanged.</p>
<h3>Overseas Silver Prices Soar</h3>
<p>London, August 21st, Reuters: A sharp upward trend occurred in the silver market. Increased trading by India and speculators, coupled with a lack of supply, caused both near-term and long-term prices to rise sharply by 4.375. The market was firm after the close. India bought at 0.0625 above the listed price, and sellers held back. Also, New York: The American silver market was also firm. Spot prices soared by 1.125 to 3.625. Also, Bombay: Indian silver prices soared. Near-term and long-term futures prices rose sharply by 39 annas (2 rupees 7 annas), reaching above 48 rupees. The market later calmed down, with only 50 contracts traded and trading still thin.</p>
<h3>Food Prices: Early Season High-Quality Rice Opens at 39 Yuan; New Supplies Arrive Steadily; Market Returns to Normal in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Rice: New supplies from various regions are gradually increasing. Yesterday, a total of 14 cars of Songting brand early and late indica rice and Wheel Brand rice cakes arrived from downriver. In addition to over 1,000 packages of Linjing goods, over 1,000 packages of new Jiashan and Jiaxing pointed rice arrived in eight cars. Over 10,000 packages of new and old pointed rice from Wuhu and Nanjing arrived, so market sentiment eased slightly. The morning market continued the momentum from the previous day, and prices remained high, rising by another 1-2 yuan. However, local shops and stores remained cautious. The market trended downward in the evening, ultimately stabilizing. The subsequent market trend seems difficult to sustain. High-quality glutinous rice opened at 39 yuan, medium-quality at 38 yuan, fresh Changzhou glutinous rice at 39 yuan, and Su Tong Kun glutinous rice at 38.5 to 38 yuan. Early and late indica rice from Songjiang and Nanhai downriver opened at 35-34 yuan, original packages at 37.5-36.3 yuan, high-quality old Wuhu pointed rice at 36-35 yuan, and new Wuhu pointed rice at 34-33 yuan. No transactions of glutinous rice were reported. Total transactions in the city were estimated at over 7,000 packages.</p>
<p>Indica Rice: Buying interest remained strong yesterday morning, with high-quality Jingwu indica rice quoted at 35-36 yuan. However, as new indica rice from various regions has already been sampled, and 1,500 packages of new indica rice from Jiangbei have arrived, and as indica rice from the Jingwu and Jiangbei areas is transported to Shanghai by truck, although the quantity is not large, market sentiment has stabilized somewhat. It is also reported that rice merchants are requesting 100,000 packages of Wuhu rice permits from the Japanese side, so the selling price in the subsequent market has returned to normal.</p>
<p>Imported Rice: There were no formal transactions yesterday. Merchants held firm on their stockpiled goods. However, it was reported that various factories and groups in the city have purchased small quantities, ranging from 30-50 tons to 300-500 tons. Prices for No. 2 and No. 3 Saigon rice were around 40 yuan, and No. 1 high-quality Saigon rice was 44-45 yuan.</p>
<h3>Amidst Rising Rice Prices, Flour Sales Surge; Wheat Arrivals Continue Strongly; Selling Price Nears 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's flour trading continued to be active. As flour sales increase daily amidst rising rice prices, retail sales at various flour shops have been overwhelming. Therefore, actual sales in the local area have surged. To maintain food supplies for the people, various factories have had to continue supplying flour as usual. However, large-volume transactions and wholesale sales to merchants are still being rejected. Total city transactions increased from over 20,000 packages to over 30,000 packages. It is reported that returned goods are favored by merchants, and trading is good, with prices still exceeding factory prices by more than 2 jiao.</p>
<p>Wheat: Supplies remain plentiful, with 6,000-7,000 packages arriving from various regions. Due to the activity of flour sales in the local area, factories have a strong need for raw materials, and many merchants are also buying. However, production costs are high, and merchants are hoarding goods amidst rising rice prices, unwilling to sell easily. Total city sales opened for wheat from Suzhou, Zhitang, Wuxi, Anting, Yangzhou, Kunshan, Nanjing, Changzhou, Benniu, Dan Yang, Wuyi, and Qishuyan, totaling 50 cars. Besides the 22 cars purchased by the Fuxin and Fufeng factories, the remaining were purchased by merchants. Prices rose by another 2-3 jiao compared to the previous day, with the highest price reaching 9.98 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oilseed Cake: Large-Scale Speculation; Oilseed Hoarding</h3>
<p>Following the momentum from the previous day, prices for various oilseed cakes continued to rise sharply. Outsiders were willing to pay high prices to collect them, with the financial sector being the most active. Domestic industry became increasingly eager. Market prices changed three times a day. In the morning, soybean oil continued to rise by 1 yuan, with over 1,000 pieces of various oils and 1,500 cans transacted. Peanut oil opened with 500 cans, soaring by 1.5 yuan. Soybeans rose again by 1-1.5 yuan, with 700-800 packages opened. Other various grains jumped by 4-5 jiao (detailed market prices are listed in the market price section). In the afternoon, rumors unfavorable to the market spread, and market sentiment fluctuated, with the underlying trend remaining a large rise with small declines.</p>
<p>3,000 packages of soybeans arrived from Beisha on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Sales to Merchants Stagnate; Yarn Market Reflects Sudden Increase; Double Globe Plummets by Over 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market opened high and closed low, with a hesitant trend. This situation has persisted for four to five days. However, the Hong Kong merchants, who had been actively buying for days, have now turned sluggish. In fact, the environment there is unfavorable, and they are temporarily pausing their purchases. Market prices are trending downward, and there is some awareness that prices have reached high levels. Stagnant sales to merchants have led to a sudden increase in supply, but raw cotton has not eased. However, prices are high, and factories are not buying. The price of 20-count Double Globe yarn was 635 yuan, a sharp decrease of 10.05 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>The market opened tight this morning due to small amounts of Double Horse yarn still being purchased by Guangzhou merchants, with opening prices up 3-4 yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 777 yuan for goods in external warehouses and 693 yuan for warehouse receipts. Shortly after, news of easing foreign exchange rates and stagnant actual demand caused the market to loosen, and a downward trend began. Speculators rushed to close their positions, and the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell sharply to 764 yuan, and warehouse receipts fell to 677 yuan, a drop of 14-15 yuan in an instant. The total volume traded in half a day was only 826 packages. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell 11 yuan, and Double Globe fell 20.05 yuan. However, the price of wool fell only 2 yuan due to tight supply. Furthermore, today's cotton yarn exports included 45 pieces shipped to Hong Kong, 20 pieces shipped to Haiphong, and 6 pieces of cloth also shipped to Haiphong and 16 pieces shipped to Hong Kong. The amounts purchased by various merchants are listed below:</p>
<p>Afternoon News: The yarn market continues to weaken as speculators are eager to close their positions. The current price for 20-count Double Horse yarn is 760 yuan, a further decrease of about 4 yuan from the closing price.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rates Ease; Foreign Cotton Trading Active</h3>
<p>Trading in domestic and foreign spot cotton is still relatively weak. Factories' buying interest is flat due to the slump in the yarn market. However, traders' sentiment is exceptionally shrewd because local inventories are decreasing daily and foreign companies' prices remain high. Therefore, some are holding tight to their goods, optimistic about the future.</p>
<p>Another report from Shanghai states that foreign cotton trading became active again yesterday due to news from Europe and easing exchange rates. The total volume traded yesterday was 500 bales of American cotton at 156 yuan and 300 bales of Brazilian cotton at 170 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of foreign cotton cloth in New York did not improve yesterday. In the morning, it rose slightly due to positive news from Liverpool, but the sudden changes in the European political situation and the signing of the Soviet-German pact caused anxiety, and trading was quiet. However, hedging sales were strong in the South, and short sellers mostly closed their positions due to the unpredictable political situation. As a result, market prices fell by 5-6 pounds. Indian cotton futures fell by 1.5 rupees, and Egyptian cotton fell by several pounds.</p>
<p>Indian cotton continues to arrive. According to previous reports, the British company Jardine Matheson's ship "Jilawa," which departed from Calcutta with 800 bales of cotton, arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 21st and docked at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong, where unloading has been completed. The ship is carrying a large amount of goods to Japan and is scheduled to depart for Japan this morning. It is also reported that the British company Butterfield &amp; Swire's "Elmbank," chartered by the Japanese company Yamashita, has departed for India to load cotton and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 27th of this month. The exact amount of cotton loaded is unknown, but it is estimated to be around 5,000 tons. Upon arrival in Shanghai, it will dock at Hongxing Wharf in Pudong for unloading. (Zuo)</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Fluctuate; Foreign Stocks See Some Selling</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities spot market showed no improvement, remaining in a fluctuating state. Market sentiment remained weak, with prices fluctuating within 1-2 jiao. Therefore, the high-low difference in the morning session was minimal. After the close, rumors suddenly spread that after the signing of the trade agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, there would be a non-aggression pact. Exchange rates lengthened. Factory sentiment stabilized slightly, and pricing was still strong, making it difficult to calculate profits. Chinese factories did not buy a single bale, and Japanese factories only purchased 100 bales of real cotton from Da Kang Factory, with delivery scheduled for September. The future of the cotton market remains uncertain. Supplies from northern Jiangsu are increasing, with 677 packages of Tongzhou cotton arriving. The sales situation is recorded below. Market sentiment was suddenly stimulated. International intrigue became increasingly bizarre, but it was beneficial to China. Therefore, the securities market suddenly rose slightly after the spot market. Class C stocks rose above 41 yuan. Since large investors are still watching, the rally has not been strong. The future may improve. At the opening, Tong Kang and Yong Kang sold successively, and there were many offers to sell No. 15 stocks. Later, Dafeng, Lianyi, and No. 14 stocks bought in, and prices strengthened slightly. Therefore, the result was only a fluctuation of 5 jiao, with high and low prices mixed. After the close, market sentiment was stimulated by rumors, and short covering suddenly increased, with a sudden rise of 6-7 jiao. Temporarily, some bulls sold off, and Class C stocks broke through 41 yuan, then retreated again. Market sentiment remains inconsistent. The total transaction volume was estimated to be over 800,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below: Category, Highest, Lowest, Closing Price, Change from Previous Day.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity stock were traded at a price of 6.3 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reported that war fears enveloped the market, and some stocks were sold off in a panic. For example, "Katoob Road" rubber stock traded as low as 3 yuan, and buyers once had the right to command the buying price. No matter how low the bid price was, there were sellers willing to sell. Later, the pressure eased slightly, and the market rebounded slightly. Despite favorable factors in the current uncertain state, such as the recent sharp decrease of 3,500 tons in London rubber reserves, they were ignored. The market behavior in the next few days will depend on the development of the political situation.</p>
<p>London British Far East Companies Stocks: The listed prices on August 21st (Monday) uniformly fell. Mercantile Bank shares fell 5 shillings, priced at £6.5. HSBC Bank London-registered shares fell £3.5, priced at £68.5. Hong Kong-registered shares fell £4, priced at £71. Kaiping Coal Mine shares fell 1 shilling, priced at 12 shillings 6 pence. Kuala Klang Rubber shares fell 3 pence, priced at 17 shillings 3 pence. The rest remained stable.</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Bonds: The listed prices on August 21st (Monday) remained stable, with no changes in prices.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Raw Silk Exports Encounter Obstacles for the First Time</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market: New York near-term contracts fell 3.5 points, and far-term contracts remained unchanged. Japanese silk spot prices fell 7 points, Shanghai silk fell 6 points, Yokohama spot prices fell 3 yuan, and far-term contracts fell 2 yuan.</p>
<p>Local silk sales were sluggish, mainly due to export difficulties, and importers were watching. It was reported that a certain foreign company's silk exports had encountered obstacles for the first time. People in the silk industry are deeply aware of the impending crisis, so they have decided to ignore the so-called "Raw Silk Inspection Institute," and its methods will likely face difficulties.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Slightly Eases</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market reported slight improvement from overseas. The closing price for September was 7.00 Dutch guilders, London reported 6 shillings for December, 6 shillings 0.25 for March of next year, and 6 shillings 1 penny for June. The association's listed price for 24 coarse white small triangle sugar was 40.5 yuan for goods in local warehouses and 40.2 yuan for external warehouses, and 32.2 yuan for transshipment goods. Taikoo granulated white sugar eased slightly. Eastern warehouse B mark was down 2 jiao to 44.3 yuan, and Western warehouse rose 1 jiao to 44.8 yuan. The rest varied slightly by 1-2 jiao. H mark granulated red sugar rose 5 jiao to 28.5 yuan. Spot Dutch red sugar initially rose 0.5 yuan to 36.5 yuan, then rose another 0.3 yuan to 36.8 yuan. Transshipment goods rose 1 yuan before and after, initially to 30 yuan, then reaching 3 yuan. No changes were made to local No. 1 white sugar and local rock sugar. Only a few dozen packages of domestic sugar extract were opened, priced at 39 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: New Hunan Lotus Seeds Appear; Shipped from a Certain Party to Shanghai</h3>
<p>New Hunan lotus seeds cannot be freely purchased in Hankou, and domestic merchants have not dared to try. It is reported that a certain party has shipped them to Shanghai, totaling 40 bags, which have already been sold. The merchant's listed price is 168 yuan, all for local lotus seeds. The market trend is firm, and the quality and selling price of old goods kept in cold storage are similar. There is not much stock in the market.</p>

<h3>Shanghai One Day: Inside the Shikumen</h3>
<p>— Liu Lang</p>
<p>Woke up in the morning and read the newspaper:</p>
<p>"...Rice store robbed...Conflict in western Shanghai...Subsidiary currency arrives in Shanghai..."</p>
<p>There was a noisy sound of people outside the door. My line of sight was disturbed and left the newspaper. My eardrums were again imprinted with the familiar mixed northern and southern accent of the landlady:</p>
<p>"You can't find a cheaper house than this anywhere you look. Sir! Fifteen yuan, in this day and age, can only be considered fifteen small coins, don't you think? Hahaha... Really, if it wasn't because there were so few of you, I really wouldn't want to rent it out!"</p>
<p>Images of fifteen yuan and a dark attic without sunlight or air were again intertwined in our minds, and feelings of hatred and resentment flooded our hearts again.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to gather my scattered thoughts and find the remaining news in the newspaper, the stairs thumped. Someone was running very anxiously, saying breathlessly:</p>
<p>"Early show opened, number sixteen!"</p>
<p>As soon as I heard this voice, I knew it was the tenant from the back building. He spends all day in the back building, which is like a chicken coop, holding a pencil in his hand, writing on a hand-folded book. People often run up to him, mutter a few words, and stuff something into his hand. Most of these people are old and young women. As for him, he only goes out in the morning, at lunchtime, and at dinner time. At first, I didn't know what he was doing. Later, I figured it out: he was running a "shipping boat."</p>
<p>My peace was disrupted. I simply got out of bed, though I didn't plan on doing anything after getting up. I sat there blankly, letting the various cries of street vendors in the alley chaotically collect in my ears.</p>
<p>"Bitter--ah--"</p>
<p>It was a woman's cry, pressing down on her throat and dragging out the final sound, coming from the front building on the second floor. A beautiful girl appeared before my eyes. She starts her day by practicing her vocalizations, and in the evening, a painted, effeminate drama teacher comes to teach her opera. Why should she learn such antiquated operas? I once asked the landlady – her father – and the reply was:</p>
<p>"What can a woman do? Even if she graduates from university, she still won't have anything to do. It's better to have her learn opera. In the future, if she has a little fame, two or three hundred yuan, six or seven hundred yuan, wouldn't be a difficult thing to earn."</p>
<p>"Another girl's life ruined by a bad family education!" I could only sigh helplessly.</p>
<p>The Beijing fiddle on the first-floor alcove rang again! Once in the morning, once in the afternoon, once in the evening, as if he was doing his homework. In my view, this person is the darling of this shikumen, and besides playing the huqin, he changes into a freshly ironed suit every day and goes out to play. I have never seen him have any worries about his life. I have never greeted him, and I don't know what kind of person he is, but I hate him for no reason.</p>
<p>My mother came back from the vegetable market with an unhappy expression. She muttered:</p>
<p>"It's really outrageous. I gave them stamps, and they嫌嫌 this and that, saying they wouldn't take them. I gave them fractional currency, and what they gave back wasn't even stamps! Really, if it wasn't for the sake of eating, who would be happy to put up with this? And, and those black-hearted rice shops, raising the price of rice to thirty-eight yuan. At this rate, we really won't be able to live!"</p>
<p>My mother threw the stamps in front of me, and I found that there were even cigarette coupons mixed in. She was very angry.</p>
<p>After this, the smoke from the stove enveloped me until after lunch.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the front building on the third floor began to get lively. A dancer lived there, dressed up in bizarre and strange ways every day. Every afternoon, young men in suits came to visit her, and their lewd laughter was unbearable to hear.</p>
<p>I often associated this dancer with the female workers in the thread factory in the main room and the "wild chickens" in the back room. The female workers work all day long, and even the best of them only earn five mao a day. They say, "One person's food costs four mao a day!" And the "wild chickens" in the back room get up early to wash clothes, go out to the early market after lunch, and low sobbing can often be heard late at night. Compared to them, that dancer is more comfortable. In fact, this is just a superficial comparison. That dancer has a mother who smokes opium and is often scolded severely for lacking money. They are all women suffering from the same hardships!</p>
<p>I hate this shikumen, but I don't have the power or courage to move. So, I stay cooped up in this shikumen all day long, from the time I get up in the morning until the landlady closes the main gate at twelve o'clock at night.</p>
<h3>The Eve of the Issuance of Fractional Currency Notes</h3>
<p>— Su Chen</p>
<p>Since copper coins were bought up by unscrupulous merchants, leading to the use of stamps as currency in the market, the troubles are needless to say, and the disputes arising therefrom are countless. Thus, every citizen looks forward to the early issuance of fractional currency notes.</p>
<p>The newspaper the day before yesterday told us the good news: the fractional currency notes are scheduled to be issued on the 22nd, and some newspapers even printed copperplate images. However, before this good news arrived, unfortunately, confusion arose again. Let me report what I saw in the past two days:</p>
<p>Regarding the disposal of the 400,000 yuan worth of stamps, the three suggestions made by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, except for the first one which is no problem, according to the news in yesterday's newspaper, the second and third points are "beyond the scope of postal services and there is no room for consideration." In other words, it is impossible for the post office to take them back. However, many shops, households, and vendors now have a considerable amount of stamps in their hands. They are kept for mailing letters, but in reality, they cannot use so many. Moreover, the small amount of capital of vendors and merchants is affected by the difficulty in selling stamps, which affects their business, no, their livelihood! Now that they hear that fractional currency notes are about to be issued, they naturally hope for it like a great drought hoping for rain clouds. But what follows is the transitional period on the eve of the issuance, which has created a chaotic phenomenon.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that after the issuance of fractional currency notes, the stamps in hand will be stranded. However, business must be done, so all whole-number transactions in places like dry goods stores and small vegetable markets require a minimum purchase of one mao (dime). When there is really no other way and there are odd amounts, they are willing to accept the fare coupons issued by the tram company because these fare coupons can be exchanged for cash. As for tofu stalls, pancake stalls, etc. on every street, although they cannot hang signs saying that they do not sell for odd amounts, they accept the fare coupons of the tram company. For the remainder, they temporarily stamp a paper with the store's seal as proof, and they are responsible for taking it back after the fractional currency notes are issued. In this way, the trouble of the procedures is needless to say, and the cost of living has increased invisibly.</p>
<p>Originally, this is a phenomenon that should exist during the transitional period. The loss of one or two days can always be tolerated, but the issuance of fractional currency notes has been postponed again due to insufficient procedures. The newspapers did not specify how long this postponement would be. On the one hand, stamps can no longer be used, and on the other hand, the issuance of fractional currency notes is postponed. If the chaotic situation of these two days continues to expand during this extended transitional period, it is indeed worrying!</p>
<p>Therefore, we make one last request to the postal authorities, that is, to be complete and clean, and to especially consider the general public, and allow them to be taken back, or even limit the amount each person can exchange, because it is most important to stabilize the lives of vendors and merchants at present!</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen: Overseas Scandal Suddenly Welcomes Peach Leaves, Miraculous Scene in the Fire Actually Blooms Lotus Flowers</p>
<p>However, white people have always held deep-seated prejudices against people of color. They believe that Eastern culture, no matter what, is ultimately inferior to Western culture. For example, a young man like Chenggong is praised by the teachers in the school. In exams, his grades may even be better than those of white children. However, their prejudice is simply that it is a pity that Chenggong is not a European or American, but a Chinese. Therefore, although Alice is getting closer to Chenggong, her parents and relatives ultimately do not want Alice to marry a Chinese. Alice has an aunt, a devout Catholic who is a spinster and has never married. She is somewhat conservative and stubborn. She even taught Alice's mother to enforce the rule and not allow her to associate with Chenggong anymore. At this time, the love between Alice and Chenggong had gradually taken root. It seemed that if they did not see each other for a few days, they would miss each other. Alice felt that it was really turning a game into reality. One day, her aunt, using a preaching tone, wanted to persuade Alice not to marry a Chinese. She collected all the bad things about the Chinese as her material. She said: "Chinese people want to bind their feet. Even if they don't bind your feet, they won't teach you to bind your feet. If you have a daughter in the future, they will force her to bind her feet. Are you willing to turn your lovely baby into a deformed cripple with her two feet?" She said: "Chinese parents are very dignified. A daughter-in-law has to kowtow to her parents-in-law. I heard that the Chinese boy surnamed Cheng has lost his father, but his mother is still alive. The Chinese have a large family system, and there are many elders. When you go to China with him in the future, will you have to kowtow to each of them?" She said: "The Chinese have a polygamous system. It is not surprising to have three wives and four concubines. When you go to China, you will be isolated and helpless, and you will become a Chinese citizen. Your motherland will no longer be able to protect you. When that happens, your man will fall in love with someone new and abandon you. What can you do? Will your lifelong happiness be sacrificed in vain?" She said: "In the Chinese marriage system, if a man dies, a woman cannot remarry. She has to observe chastity for him until she dies. If a woman dies, a man can marry another woman within a month, and no one will say he is unfeeling. This is stipulated by Chinese law and customs. Do you think you can endure such gender inequality?" In addition, she nagged and said many embarrassing things. In conclusion, marrying a Chinese man would ruin a woman's happiness. There is nothing more foolish than this! (172)</p>
<p>Life Reports</p>
<h3>Buttonholes</h3>
<p>— Xu You</p>
<p>In ordinary tailor shops selling ready-made Western suits, after they rent a small shop, they divide the shop to make a buttonholing room, which must have ten to twenty female workers who make buttonholes.</p>
<p>Here, you can never see the sunlight, and a five-candlepower electric light is lit all day long. This group of buttonholing female workers makes those small navy blue buttonholes under this dim light. Humid, dark, foul odor, coupled with deafening machine noise, people who come here for the first time will feel seasick.</p>
<p>The company undertakes mostly overcoats, raincoats, and most of all school uniforms. They pull and sew stitch by stitch every day.</p>
<p>A Zhongshan suit has a total of thirty-one buttons, and at most four sets can be sewn every day. The wage for each set is one dime. A raincoat has eight buttons, but the wage is only five cents. Work clothes have ten buttons, but the wage is still five cents. Even if you work hard, you can earn at most forty cents a day, and you have to pay for the thread yourself.</p>
<p>Others may think that this needlework life is easy and effortless, but when you have worked for three hours, you will feel dizzy and blurred.</p>
<p>If the sewing is not done well and is found out during inspection, it must be taken apart and resewn. Once the buttonhole has been taken apart, the threads will loosen, and the work done will be twice as laborious as the first time.</p>
<p>The work in tailor shops is seasonal. When it is busy, you are so tired that you cannot breathe. You have to work fourteen or fifteen hours a day, so dizzy and blurred that your head feels like it weighs dozens of pounds. When it is idle, there are only one or two days a week to work, or even seven days of eating white rice at home.</p>

<h3>Concentrating Manpower, Materials and Financial Resources: RKO's New Film Plan</h3>
<p>— A Yun</p>
<p>——Completing Fifty-Eight Feature Films</p>
<p>July of each year is the period when all film companies in Hollywood are mobilized, and there is a comprehensive review of the production policy for the second half of the year and the next year, personnel transfers, budget estimates, and signing of sales contracts. RKO Pictures announced a shocking new film plan during this period, which is to produce fifty-eight feature films and one hundred and ninety-eight short films from the second half of 1939 to the first half of 1940. The magnitude of this number can be said to be a brand new record in the history of RKO production.</p>
<p>Comedic stars Laurel and Hardy will also star in "The Flying Deuces" under the banner of RKO. There is also a comedic giant, Luo Ke, who also has his own new work distributed by RKO. The star lineup is quite large, including Qin Shu Lao Ji Si, Que Er Si Lao Dun, Li Si Kang Huo Hua, Ka Luo Lang Bai, Ka Lai Ge Lun, Anna Ni Ge Er, Fan Peng Ke Jr., Lei Meng Ma Sai, An Xiu Lan, Wei Duo Mai Ke Luo Lun, Li Que Di Ke Si, Shi Bei Zi Ling, Ke Lan Qu Le Fo, etc., all have excellent starring works.</p>
<p>What is most worthy of special mention is that the artistic master Hua Er De Di Si Nai, who gave the princess a special white, will put all his efforts in 1939-1940 to produce another five-color feature cartoon, named "Pinocchio". The capital and technical personnel used in the film are twice as much as "Snow White". When it is completed in the future, it will surely cause a sensation around the world.</p>
<p>The great French writer 俄氏's "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" is once again made into a sound film, starring the most outstanding film actor Que Er Si Lao Dun. His superb acting skills and calm demeanor in playing this role will undoubtedly overwhelm the past Lang Que Nai.</p>
<p>There is also a historical epic film about Lincoln, "Abe Lincoln in Illinois", starring the New York actor Lei Meng Ma Sai. In addition, there is a Broadway hit "The American Way", which has been a sensation for two years. Ka Lai Ge Lun stars in "Passport to Life", and Li Si Lian Huo Hua plays three roles at the same time, starring in, producing, and directing "The Man Who Lost Himself".</p>
<p>This time, RKO Pictures will concentrate manpower, materials, and financial resources to complete the above-mentioned plan in twelve full months.</p>
<p>Notes from the Entertainment Industry</p>
<h3>One Aspect of Acting Experience (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Sun Min</p>
<p>Talking about the Difficulty of Villainous Roles and Virtuous Roles</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Sun Jing has been dedicated to the film industry very early, and he is also a veteran in the film industry with a lot of acting experience. In the past, he had a wide reputation and was known as the "Romantic Young Man". In recent years, since he changed to playing villainous roles, he has become a screen villain denounced by everyone. It can be said that his ability to play both virtuous and villainous roles is his strength, and the arguments in this article are all based on experience and are very interesting.</p>
<p>When the domestic film industry was just budding, I joined this barren art garden and became a loyal laborer. First, I studied at the China Film School, and then joined the Shenzhou Company. I filmed for nearly three years, and then transferred to "Great China" for two years, "Great Wall" for two years, "Tianyi" for four or five years, "Mingxing" for more than four years, and until this spring when I was invited to "Xinhua". I have filmed no less than a hundred films. In terms of experience, I seem to be no weaker than others, but in terms of results, I always feel that I only have a false reputation and there are no satisfactory works.</p>
<p>In the past, I only played virtuous roles and was always called the "Romantic Young Man". In the domestic film style five or six years ago, before it was transformed into focusing on consciousness, except for so-called martial arts films, all the young male roles were based on the so-called "handsome and elegant" form, and there was no fundamental difference between tough and soft roles. Later, there was a new realization on this, and I also followed the changes of the times.</p>
<p>The reason why I suddenly changed from playing virtuous roles to playing villainous roles was when I joined "Mingxing" six years ago. At that time, most people felt that there was a lack of villainous young male roles of the new type. Several directors thought that I had enough acting experience to cope with it, so they asked me to take on the role. After this change of style, and with their praise, I was no longer allowed to play virtuous roles again. Until now, I have passively become a role specializing in playing villainous roles.</p>
<p>Although villainous and virtuous roles seem to be the same as acting, I have many different feelings in my experience. In fact, villainous roles are much more difficult to play than virtuous roles. In reality, it is not only difficult and not easy to please, but the general public also tends to view the position of villainous roles as lower than virtuous roles. Judging from this, playing villainous roles is indeed too much of a disadvantage.</p>
<h3>Tan Li Debin</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yu</p>
<p>Young Male Actor of Song Dezhus Troupe</p>
<p>The first batch of actors after the autumn cool season at the Golden Grand Theater have invited Song Dezhu and Yang 森. I have written about Song and Yang in this newspaper. I have not mentioned the supporting actors of Dezhu. The supporting actors of Dezhu have been invited and will not be changed. There are young male actor Li Debin, martial arts actor Xiao Deyin, clown Ai Shiju, martial arts assistant Tong Dexin, etc. Among them, Xu Shiju is already well-known to the people of Shanghai and does not need to be introduced. Deyin will be recorded in another article. Here, the so-called is the young male actor Li Debin.</p>
<p>Debin was originally named Zhibin. His father died early, so he and his mother lived in his maternal grandfather's house and were raised by his uncle, so he was able to become an adult. He studied in elementary school in his childhood. In the 30th year of the Republic of China, he was admitted to the opera school. The school thought that he was beautiful and gentle, so he asked the old actor Feng Huilin to teach him young male dramas. His opening play was "Yuan Dou Shooting Halberd". Later, he was guided by the famous ticket holder Bao Dan Ting. He can perform more than a hundred plays, and he is best at performing hero roles, such as "Eight Great Hammers", "Ya Guan Lou", "Cui Ying Hui", and "Yellow Crane Tower". He is also a masterpiece. Recently, he will come to the south with Dezhu to dedicate his art to us. At this time when there is a lack of young male talents, it is expected that Debin, who is both civil and military, will become popular in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Dance League</h3>
<p>— Mu Zi</p>
<p>(1) Motivation</p>
<p>At the end of June this year, the Dance League, like a child leaving its mother's arms, began to learn to walk. In early autumn, it became more lively. I want to visit the "Dance League" to record some laughter or bitterness for the suffering sisters under the flooding tide of the times.</p>
<p>(2) A Terrible and Lovely Girl? Before entering the gate of the Dance League, I first remembered a sentence. This was told to me by a friend who could tell witty words two years ago: "This is a terrible and lovely girl!" After entering the gate, I only saw a piece of sky blue. Before I could see clearly, a plain-dressed and smiling girl walked out of it. She bowed deeply to me and asked me in a bell-like clear and soft tone: "Which one are you looking for, sir?"</p>
<p>After explaining the purpose, she expressed welcome and led me to visit the inner room: several ladies sitting and reading books stood up and stared at me. The lady who led the visit introduced them to me one by one. They all wore homespun clothes.</p>
<p>(3) Embarking on the Bright Road</p>
<p>In the inner room, in addition to a piano placed in the center, what can attract people's attention most should be the inscriptions of many celebrities. Mr. Yuan's dragon "Self-Reliance" and Mr. Kanghou's old-fashioned handwriting "If you have surplus energy, use it to learn." Here, there is also a newspaper reading area and a book lending department. The music room and the reception room are connected. The inner room and the outer room are only separated by a moon gate. This design is clever and beautiful enough. It is easier to make people feel a quiet pleasure when accompanied by a piece of sky blue. In the center of the office is a large notice board. All the words on the notices are written in vernacular or even more vulgar words. Looking from the outer room to the inner room, you can clearly see a long couplet in the moon gate: "Embarking on the bright road, offering that pure conscience." How profound are these words.</p>
<p>(4) From now on, I will never use suicide to end a useful life.</p>
<p>During the visit, I had many conversations with the plain-dressed and smiling girl, but I never dared to ask her name, because in my understanding, I came to visit the "League" and not to know the "people", but the "people" were finally known. This is the last few words of that girl, and it is also my first real emotion for this. When she spoke excitedly, I was afraid that she would shed tears. She was spitting out word by word in a fighting voice: "Sir, we are human beings, we are also women who have souls and are willing to move forward. We must work harder to awaken our sisters. From now on, we will never use suicide to end our useful lives!"</p>

<h3>New Inventions in the Film Industry</h3>
<p>— (Jing Yuan)</p>
<p>Recently, a famous cinema in London—the Wen He Cinema—has adopted a new invention that allows deaf people to hear the sounds emitted by the film.</p>
<p>The device of this new invention is to connect an amplifier to a microphone, which is installed on the sound machine behind the screen, and then connect it to the specially set seats with underground wires (placed under the carpet). When the film is screened, due to the relationship of the induced current, the sound is transmitted to the eardrums of the deaf people, which is extremely clear, so that the deaf people can hear the dialogues and songs directly emitted from the screen. This new invention has made the business of Wen He Cinema much better.</p>
<p>Currently, major cinemas are installing them one after another.</p>
<h3>Outside Records of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Shaving and Plucking Hairs are the Two Great Sufferings of Actors</p>
<p>Westerners often wash their hair with cold water, intending to show skill, but the Chinese habit of shaving must first use boiling water to scald and wash, and then shave it. If done occasionally, it will not cause much harm. If a Jing Xing (painted-face actor) has to do this every day, his pain and unsanitary condition are probably the worst. In the past, in the backstage of opera troupes, there were often one or two barbers who were good at doing the washing and shaving work for the Jing Xing. Now that there are safety razors, and the big actors are using porters to carry their bags, these daily chores are mostly done by these deaf people. However, some theaters still use barbers as before.</p>
<p>It is a unique situation on the Chinese stage to have men dress up as women, but after a man reaches the age of twenty, his beard will naturally grow out. Moreover, the more you hate this thing, the faster it grows. The more often you shave it, the harder and blacker it becomes. Once you reach the age of thirty, it is simply impossible to stop it. Imagine that a Dan Jue (female role) relies entirely on a delicate face and fair skin to be welcomed. If the beard is too dense and too strong, even if you can shave it off with a knife once a day, the black stubble turns a dark green color when you apply powder, which is exactly as the saying goes, "smearing lime on an eggplant," which really reduces the beauty. If an old Zheng Gong Qing Yi (leading female role), such as Chen Delin and Wu Caixia, occasionally plays a role, the audience can especially forgive them, because they pay close attention to their singing, acting, and skills, and have long put the question of beauty aside. For the four famous Dan (female roles) such as Mei, Cheng, Xun, and Shang, and other male Dans, it seems that the audience's psychology cannot be separated from the question of beauty. Therefore, everyone has to discuss the beauty of the "appearance" at the mouth and neck. (86)</p>
