<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本對華經濟策略的檢討</h3>
<p>現代國家的侵略，以經濟爲唯一目標；而日本對於中國，却同時包涵政治軍事經濟三項目標；在他最初意識之中，經濟雖屬重要成分，而其違反理智的事實發展，却變爲政治軍事爲主，而經濟爲賓；這不是現代的侵略了，十足是原始的掠奪，這不僅分析他的政策性質，可作如此辨別，更證以他在中國淪陷區域的種種小動作，允見所謂原始掠奪的準確。當然，這是日本方面所不願承認的，但問題在事實形態，而不在願或不願；即使日本根本吾認侵略，吾認經濟侵略，也祇要今後有新的事實形態，足資反證，即無待乎日本方面的吾認。</p>
<p>日本無意識的偏重了政治軍事，政治陰謀與軍事進攻固然沒有成功，而他的經濟策動亦跟着失敗了。所謂政治陰謀，以「以華制華」爲基調。所謂軍事進攻，以速戰速決爲戰略。所謂經濟策動，倒不是掠奪的小動作，而是「華北開發會社」「華中振興會社」的成立。(華南方面，暫託「臺灣拓殖會社」經營，規模不大，茲不具論)</p>
<p>華北華中兩會社，同於去年十一月七日「正式成立」，其所負使命則一如「滿鐵」之於東四省，即日人所謂「國策會社」者是。前者資本金定爲日金三億五千萬元：事業計、畫分爲（一）交通運輸及港灣（二）郵電通信（三）發電事業（四）鑛產（五）鹽之製造販賣與利用等。後者資本金定爲日金一億元；事業計畫分爲（一）鐵道（二）水運（三）通信（四）無綫電播音（五）電氣與自來水（六）鑛產（七）上海公用事業（八）水產等。(至於華北主要富源的植棉事業，另由一「華北棉花公司」加以控制。)從兩會社的事業計畫看來，似乎包羅萬象，可將華北華中的資源一綱打盡，無奈在事實上郤大謬不然。</p>
<p>事實使他失敗的：第一，軍事佔領區域不但在國際公法上是暫時佔領的性質，並非兵力所至，便可據爲己有；且在種種客觀條件上，亦祗佔領了點與綫，並未能穩定的佔領「面」。證以滬寗滬杭兩路的屢屢被切斷，可見所謂綫，絕非穩定；更證以湘贛晋鄂各省，一經華軍反攻，便己收復若干河山城鎮，亦可見所謂點。絕非穩定，日本偏重軍事，而軍事所佔領的點綫猶且把握不住，則附麗於軍事的經濟策略，安得施展。</p>
<p>第二，在中國講求經濟設施，以能得中國人的合作爲事實上的必要條件。日本在軍事佔領區域內，威足以懾手無寸鐵而囊無餘資的淪陷華人；而兩年來日本方面的大屠殺與小動作，別說淪陷華人如何悲憤怨毒，至少亦是敬而遠之，豈能辦到所謂合作。跟了日本人跑的傀儡，無論其意識，能力，乃至於「身分」，根本上不配做雙方合作中的一方。再想像日本人方面的意念，亦決不視淪陷華人爲可以推心置腹，同謀共濟的朋友；相交如主從，相防如防賊，試問如何投資？如何建立經濟關係？又豈能推行其經濟策略？</p>
<p>第三，日本方面，本身無辦法。華北華中兩會社的資本金，號稱三億五千萬圓與一億圓；驟視之，似不可謂少，然以之担當如其所計畫中的各項事業，則實屬異常薄弱。且事實上，日本政府所出的資本，除所謂「實物股」外，極爲微細：大部分皆待日本之民間投資，而民間對此項投資既不放心，又無興趣。(華北會社的民股分爲三百五十萬股，其問公開募得的僅有十萬股。華中會社的民股分爲十萬股，股束却有九千七百七十人！)成績如此悽慘，乃不得不採用發行公司偵券的方式；天曉得，誰來消納了債券？事事碰壁，於是乎由東京政府與各關係方面歷經討論後，認爲對於華北華中以及「滿洲五年開發計畫」日本政府皆無從資助。於是乎其預定方針，不得不改紋更張。華北會社的董事會在北平集會，決定修改組織法，以後凡所設施應以滿足當地需要者爲限，而不再以束京所預定的方案爲基礎。換言之，今後東京方面對於在中國本部的經濟開發計畫，只有取袖手旁觀態度，一切事業須兩會社自行支持；萬一有東京資助的必要，則以直接產生利潤足資彌補者爲限。事實證明日本侵略之下的對華經濟策略失敗了！金石書畫，紅木檯櫈，雖經有效的小動作滿載而歸；這在原始掠奪，未始不可謂爲相常成功；但在現代經濟侵略之中，爲估價之所不及。</p>
<h3>英法聯軍　嚴陣以待德軍進攻　法軍砲隊轟德軍集中點大批德軍星夜開赴前綫</h3>

<h3>培養童子軍軍師資議（上）  楊克敬</h3>
<p>詳陳培養童軍師資之必要</p>
<p>（重慶航訊）中國童子軍總會組織科長楊克敬、以及我國童子軍師資極形缺乏、撰著培養童子軍師資　議一文、對今後如何培養大量的童子軍師資、有具體建議、可供參考、茲錄其原文如下、</p>
<p>自教部通令全國初級中學、一律實施童子軍訓練以來·各省市初中未有組織童子軍者、大都遵照部令紛紛辦理童子軍、全中小學　喝無一律實施幼童軍訓練之明令、而自動辦理幼童軍或童子軍者·亦復不少、據教部二十五年之統計、全國中學共三二所、其中有高中三六所、高級職業學校一九一所、師範八一四所、高實踐混合五三〇所、高初級職業學校混合四九四所、實踐一三九〇所、除高中及高職而外、其餘三〇三七所、依照部令、均應辦理童子軍、至少每校必須童子軍教練員一人、若學生人數過多之學校、必須增加至二三人、全國小學共計三二〇〇八〇所、倘小學一律辦理幼童軍、至少亦必須每校有教練員一人、像這樣大的數字、即在平時、童子軍教練員實有人數、已感不敷、況在抗戰期間、童子軍教練人員多改業軍政各界、其有撤退後方、繼續擔任童子軍工作者、爲數有限、更感受童子軍師資缺乏之苦、今年春季、重慶各中小學、及兒童保育院、函請中國童子軍部民會及重慶市理事會介紹童子軍教練員、計有十餘處、每苦無人可介紹、重慶如此、四川全省可知，推而至於後方各省、何莫不然、此童子軍師資之所以宜急於培養也、</p>
<p>童子軍訓練、原爲教育之一種、誰也不能否認、童子軍教師、由師範學校造就、此亦爲天經地義、中國童子軍總會曾於今年春季、函請教部令全國師範學院及師範學校增加童子軍課程、以便學生畢業後、可以充當中小學童子軍教師、一是爲師範學生多開一條出路、再則爲童子軍增加大批優良之教師、用意誠至善也、計全國師範學院共有六所、師範學校共八一四所、每年畢業學生至少有十分之一、可以充當中小學童子軍專任教師、而全體畢業學生、都可以爲童子軍兼任教師、幾年以後、全中中小學校、均有優良之童子軍教師矣、由此言之童子軍師資、培養之機關、最相宜者、莫師範學校若也、</p>
<p>青年會籌備　學生服務社</p>
<p>上海男女青年會學生部、因　於書籍文具日常服務等價格飛漲、爲謀減同學負擔起見、發起組織學生服務社、收集各校同學舊收文具日常用品等、陳列女青年會附設之家庭物品交易社內、　價代售、在物主以不合則之舊物、可得經濟上之收入、而購者以低廉之價格、獲得需用之物品、實屬一舉兩得、該社已於九月二十八日、開第一次全體大會、現正籌備、擬定於十一月一日正式開幕、</p>
<p>失學救濟所　舉行集中查考</p>
<p>本市貧兒　失學救濟所　創設之義務小學十所、及中心義務實驗小學一所、業經完全開學、學生總數約計一千名左右、學級編製係根據教部規定、將修業年限縮短、小學六年課程合併於四年內完成、並爲節省經費計、採用原級復式制、茲因各校開學已有月餘、爲考查各生成績起見、即日起舉辦集中查考、由該所命題交各校教員分發學生應試、優良者由所發給獎品、以資鼓勵云、</p>

<h3>金融　美匯轉鬆英金緊　美英匯兌回長影</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、匯豐掛牌、仍無上落、英美匯暗市、潛勢平靜、略趨鬆動、晨初因海外美英匯兌、突回長一分一二五、致開時局勢英微緊〇三一二五、美則無分榮辱、開後市面異常淸淡、交易極少、首由日商洋行忽來扒結、但華商於同時適來拋出、且外行除匯豐外、供意茶殷、是故反見帶硬、惟匯豐頓乘機吸收現貨先令、繼之有利接踪買進、故市勢無形轉平、延至午刻、扒風已息、遂又稍硬、迨至午後、雖有利有少數吃胃但絕無絲毫影響、市况寂寞、收盤時亦未稍變、結果英緊○一五六二五、美則反長〇三一二五、至期貨情勢、全與現貨相同、市上做開、聞有利中途會吸進十一月份美匯而掉出同月英九角六分六厘七、交易上午尙旺、下午甚淸、</p>
<p>華商賣出日商進</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條及美銀價均無來電、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美·對滬·對法均平、美對英長一分一二五、對滬小一角五分、對法大半分、中央掛脾各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士五三一二五、美匯七元半、較之上週末、英緊〇三一二五、美則未更動、乃匯兌回漲之故、開後華商稍有賣胃、兼外銀行華比某行等亦有供意、是以爲狀略帶硬化、計華商與外行相繼賣予日洋行現貨英金四辦士五三一二五及五六二五、並現貨美匯七元五三一二五及五六二五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無升降、此後匯豐突來吸進某行現貨英金四辦士五六二五、時有利亦吃進華商十一月份美匯七元四三七五、少頃有利忽吐予同行十一月份英金四辦士半、(合套十一月份英美匯兌爲三元九角六分六厘七光景)、後有利突代某方吸進同行現貨英金四辦士五三一二五、及現貨美匯七元半、是以過程回平、午刻扒風稍戢、市勢重稍鬆硬、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士五四六八七五、美匯七元五三一二五、比晨開英鬆〇一五六二五、美硬〇三一二五、</p>
<p>午後市況殊清淡</p>
<p>後市狀態更形沉寂、聞有利仍有少許吃胃、但價則毫無變動、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價英金四辦士五四六八七五、美匯七元五三一二五、本月份英金四辦士五一五六二五、美匯七元四六八七五、十一月份英金四辦士四五三一二五、美匯七元三四三七五、結果比上週末現期英均微緊〇一五六二五、美則俱反軋鬆〇三一二五、</p>

<h3>金市徘徊</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、雖外滙報鬆、以及我軍勝利等利空消息、充斥於市、但終因扒者猛烈可驚、致結果能以較上日提高一元之差、作當日收盤價格、初開滙票略鬆、價爲四千〇十二元、當小十一元之譜、繼而港帮搜購於先、致會拉高、但未幾其他各帮咸來賣出、寡不敵衆、而慘落至四千〇〇六元當日低盤、惟港帮仍未肯示弱、扒進不少、終被抬高至四千〇二十八元當日高舉、延至午收爲四千〇十六元、午後有金號售出、價又撳小數元、自此時起以迄收盤止、中途港帮吸胃之濃、較上午並未遜色、故爲四千〇二十四元收盤、全夭交易暢旺、約一千三百餘兩、銀樓飾金始終未變、海關金等仍平定如、故</p>
<p>烚赤無大上落</p>
<p>自晨每條(十兩、)初開聞外匯帶硬、人氣較虛、開市即做小十一元、錢兌業互做三十兩、爲四千〇十二元、開後錢兌業又互做十兩、爲四千〇十元、時香港帮突來活動、一時售者觀望、一跳七元、某銀樓進同業三十兩、價爲四千〇十七元後、又抬高三元、錢兌業進金號二十兩、爲四千〇二十元、嗣因錢兌業與金號及銀樓帮等賣意轉濃、互相供塞不息、，雖其時港帮尙有納胃、但已不若初時之健、不久盤小十元、銀樓帮賣予金號十兩、價爲四千〇十元、此後證券帮前來吸進、致抬起六元、證券帮進金號二十兩、爲四千〇十六元、旋以現金號又興賣風、加之進者不力、立撳十元、現金號售予證券帮二十兩、爲四千〇〇六元、後聞外匯由鬆回平、買者漸多、少頃即回出四千〇十元關、其時香港帮復來猛進五百餘兩、遂再步高十餘元、某銀樓進錢兌業二十兩、爲四千〇二十八元、午刻港帮又止進觀望、且聞外滙復稍帶硬、不支回跌十三元、錢兌業互做十兩、爲四千〇十五元、繼之錢兌業進金號二十兩、爲四千〇十六元作午收價、午後初開平靜首由錢兌業互做十兩、爲四千〇十七元、後某金號前來吐塞、做低五元、某金號售予錢兌業三十兩、爲四千〇十二元、入後港帮忽叉委某金號與某銀樓力吸、即拉高十二元某銀樓進錢兌業三十兩、及某金號進錢兌業十兩、均爲四千〇二十四元、作晚收價、結果比上週末軋漲一元、現金號之本牌金售出價照烚赤較高十元收進均須减低三十元光景、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金仍懸原價</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、因烚赤無大上落、致終日未聞變動、大同行仍懸四百〇五元原價、新同行與上價相同、收進均須减低二十元之譜、</p>
<h3>證券　債市恬靜　會得豐股創新高價</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市況、經上週六一度劇漲後、昨日趨勢、仍見繼續前進之恒力、所謂和平空氣者、又屬曇花一現、市上更有續發公債之流言、故債市又趨於盤旋之狀、以待新消息之協助、昨日經過、買賣雙方數量雖不鉅、而作風則始終一貫、如天生聯和大豐等號、則上下午始終買進、鴻大大通等號、則上下午始終賣出、餘則鴻康茂泰重於進、德孚聯益及同裕則偏於出、因均無大量出入、故市價亦盤旋沉悶、計其一日結果、大都續好五分至二角半、惟丁種因上週六下午未曾做開、故而獨漲九角半、成交總數四五十萬元、茲列簡表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易南洋兄弟烟草公司股、因行將發息、市價已抬至九元外，但市面缺貨、未有成交、又衆業公所報吿、昨日股市、雖祇下午忽促一小時之交易、但仍活潑非凡、會得豐股上漲至六十六元空前高價、允堪注目、國際信託公司股亦升達七元、其他股票少變化、橡皮股興趣叉吿閑散、美國橡皮九月份消費額爲五寓零一百噸、保持前月高度水凖、同月存底爲十五萬零二百噸、計跌一萬一千噸、是項存底現祇敷三個月供給之需、實已低落至危險階段、故必須速謀補足、以免弘起嚴重情勢、紐的市塲生橡皮現貨價之超越期貨價、乃此種情勢所產生之直接後果、</p>
<h3>瑞鎔鐵廠</h3>
<p>定期召集股東會</p>
<p>橡皮信託將派息</p>
<p>本埠滙通洋行經理之橡皮信託有限公司、茲經董事會議決、定於十月廿五日起開派截至一九三九年九月底止之一年度第二决中期股息、每股國幣一角五分、第一决亦派一角五分、合計已派國幣三角、本埠安利洋行經理之英商瑞鎔鐵廠有限公司定於十一月十日召開臨時股東大會、討論公司結束淸算事宜、並決定辦理淸算會計師暨淸理員、</p>
<h3>紗花　買戶意興闌珊　棉紗不易振作</h3>
<p>紗市仍屬平定之局、但趨勢稍見參差、市價升降五異、市塲依然沉寂，故交易尤爲减色、至於一般經營者、微露心灰之象、對於目下做多觀念、殊覺冷澹、於是氣勢遂呈徬徨無定之狀態也、就大勢觀測、因消化不良、前途恐難振作、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、依舊不離散漫氣象、延遲多時開盤、但買戶寥寥、二十支雙馬外棧現貨價爲七百十元、跌九元、棧單呌喊者雖衆、然吃戶殊乏、旋開爲六百九十二元、少頃搶帽子買風忽起、又復回升至七百二十元、卒以實需不振、重趨下降、收盤價二十支雙馬爲七百十三元、查半日成交、統計八百四十二包、行情雙馬跌九元半、雙地球跌六元半、天女跌八元、惟二十支牧羊漲七元、廠方由鴻章廠開出十支新賣彝二百包、價爲五百六十五元、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、同行〇八五　香港二〇五內地一四五　厦門七二江西一一五　寗波二〇統計八四二</p>
<h3>棉花廠需減色　通花到四千餘包</h3>
<p>本棉生意尚堪維持、但廠方納胃奇　、良以紗市不振、而銷路狹隘、故對於添辦原料之意、甚爲澹泊、因此交易大减色、至於同業、鑒於以上情况、買賣亦不及昔日之熱鬧、日一廠亦沉悶如恒、所以棉市無甚榮辱可分、不過氣勢穩定、蘇北來源尙不斷絕、兩日間又到四千四百十九包、茲將現棉售盤情形列左、通州　一三五·〇〇　一三六·〇〇　同業　五〇〇包常陰沙　一三四　同業　二〇〇包火機　一三〇·七五　同業　一二〇包太倉花一三九·〇〇新生　五〇〇包巴西　一七三·〇〇　萬昌　二〇件</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、因匯兌之呆定、交易毫無起色、各方均有所期待、廠方進意殊爲淡薄、同業間亦暫時不願售、况日來通州到貨甚爲擁擠、故外棉交易、頗爲靜寂也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初殊爲靜寂？各業均以週末之故、俱抱觀望態度、孟買來電俱吿下落、後又因南方套賣及多頭了結、結果收盤價格較之上日跌去一二磅音、印度連同預測跌三羅比、埃及漲三五磅音、</p>
<h3>糧食　客秈回漲　破新粳兩無榮辱</h3>
<p>杜來市場已施行整頓買賣規則、故各地作客蒞市者、異常擁擠、且天時轉陰、人心向榮、客尖昨有本鄕作客相繼問津、初市開手各客販即先後一律喊高半元至一元左右、昨江北尖開十九元一角、南京一號南關尖十九元、二號十九元三角、中十九元、蕪湖尖自十九元半、至十八元二角半、羊蘆尖亦好二三角不等、蘇崑楓嘉羊尖二十三元二角至二十一元半、蘆尖特二十三元六七角、至二十二元、各破粳價與新貨相距太遠、且又特貨缺乏均屬中决者、因之交易不暢、價無榮辱、計常帮特破開三十二元、市三十元、中二十八元三角、無錫高破三十元决至二十七元、蘇同帮破二十六五元、新粳以到貨絡繹、亦無甚上落、做開常州新粳二十八元、崑山新粳二十七元至二十六元、蘇同帮粳二十六元至二十四元、百哥到貨不多、作客又都揀選佳品、因决貨身骨軟劣、易起變化、致賣買雙方心思各異、結果成提高殺决之局面、特別貨升一元有奇、若楓嘉特百哥開十九元二角、市十七元四角、次至十六元半、靑角窰種則日來祇到一二百包、亦屬緊俏異常、初喊三十一元、後實售三十元零五角及三十元、並見升起一元有奇、變元平平、陳三十一元至三十元、新二十五六元、統計全市到貨四千餘包、成交數一萬四五千包、</p>
<p>客秈昨日到頭較減、除蕪湖南京等存米續有裝到外、江北秈米則產價不鬆、低價之中决貨已須虧本、因此行販一方停辦外、對於新到及前存各米均不肯隨市輕脫、又値本客趁低吸收、內地與囤戶各去一千多包、本街鄉莊亦頗活潑、價乃回漲半元至六七角不一、高客秈已至二十元、中决不等、</p>
<h3>麵粉廠盤　改昂至七元二角小麥亦跟漲四角</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨市場盤已實行提升塲方面、南北洋帮及內地等處、進胃堪稱聯蟬、惟廠方售意甚堅、回籠貨更鮮供給、聞紅藍車新棧單價開七元二角七分、兵船牌轉棧貨價七元一角三分、十月期鳳凰牌亦到六元九角之價、均比上週提漲二三角、又聞洋粉以來源吿絕、及歐戰和平失望、人心良好、雙鷹牌成交一千包、價已漲至七元八角、蝙蝠牌進戶不貪、暫乏妥交、小麥　昨市亦趨好轉、來源並不湧旺、兩天中到貨約計萬餘包、連日粉市步挺、原料隨之帶起、昨日廠胃頗殷、囤戶去化亦不寂寞、統市由福阜兩廠辦去管店·蘇州·常州·無錫·六合·安慶等貨六千餘包、囤戶進辦管店·崑山·丹陽等麥六車、市面較上週末見昂四角左右、</p>
<h3>油市　豆油先跌後回</h3>
<p>昨日豆油起伏頗巨、一日間相差一元二三角、晨初承上週疲憊餘勢、一般浮囤亟謀出籠、神戶油首先跌去六角、其他各油紛紛跟跌四五角不等、入後內地錫常帮忽來拖進、市氣立見振作、大戶趁機扳佾、結果各油行情復至上週五之原盤、且神戶油反漲六角、其最高價爲六十六元、統市共計做開膠州油二百件、(價詳市價欄)烟歧油八十件、靑岐油五十件、神戶油三十六桶、連油一百十五桶、白絞聽裝油一百五十聽、花生油本街成交七百件、價開五十七元五角、比前市跌去三角云、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷糖產價續升</h3>
<p>—粗車白跟漲—</p>
<p>昨洋糖據荷蘭電訊、又漲六角、粗白已升至荷盾一〇·四〇、公會劃盤趨勢甚緊、現貨二四粗白續升二元左右、本棧貨爲五十三元半、外棧貨初爲五十四元一角、旋升至五十四元半、後以某號趁高、稍有脫售、乃回至五十四兀、轉口貨四十二元、太古車白漲一元半、東棧B嘜五十八元六角、西棧五十九元、餘照退、H嘜車赤升七角、爲四十元二角、荷赤升一元爲四十二元、本綿白升二元、振記一號五十四元半、二號五十四元、三號五十三元半、四號五十三元，本冰升度相同、一號冰六十四六元、晶明冰六十七元半、國糖依然擯持、絕無成交、又昨由北海運來糖一百四十包、</p>
<h3>南北貨　江北花生獻新　價開市擔廿三元</h3>
<p>江北新花生、昨由無錫轉到二批一爲七十八包、一爲九十包、當即開出、價為每市擔二十三元、復據青島函訊、新花生到一百二十包、由洋莊辦去、價爲十六元、生仁辦價見鬆、陳貨降一元、以二十六元爲該處油坊辦五十八包、存數已稀、新生仁到二百餘包、降去二元、以二十四元由洋莊及申帮等辦入、價爲二十四元、</p>
<h3>疋頭　同業存貨充斥棉布交易清淡　東疋疲莫能興</h3>
<p>布市以客銷不暢、本街同業存貨充斥、囤戶觀望不動、散戶微有轉售、故交易淸淡、市價迂迥下跌、白貨粗布·粗斜跌一角左右、細布·細斜跌一角至二角半、漂染印花布疋一部份亦續降(每疋)二三角、當令各種絨布、以存底淺薄、價雖平定、惟已不如以前俏俐、客銷以南路及國外稍有點綴、滇帮辦色布·色斜·錢呢·條漂布三四十箱、粤帮辦絨布·色布·色斜·粗布近五十件、甬帮辦色斜·色布·粗布七八十件、閩帮辦色布·色斜二十餘箱、國外暹羅孟買新加坡等地採購色布·色斜·漂布·印花貨近二千疋、</p>
<p>東疋細布·細斜跌風續厲、十二磅龍頭細布現貨昨巳降至每疋二十元〇一角至二角、細斜高中擋牌子亦已降落二十元以內、龍頭售開十九兀二角半、市氣銷沉、其原因由於實際交易冷落、業外囤戶急求脫卸、遂致直綫下墜、疲莫能興、色貨四君子嗶嘰咋開每碼六角五分、直貢六角六分、較高峯市盤亦已瀉跌七八分一碼、</p>
<h3>市况誌</h3>
<p>外幣一致回疲昨日匯市及金價雖無甚軒輊、然外幣則又呈疲勢、美金票初則曾高至十三元五角二三分、繼而步降至十三元四角、午後忽傳贛北大勝、同業心思大都看小、卒乃退至十三元三角八分、結果軋小四分、英金鎊票各跌五角、美元亦小五角、香港票低二分、法郞票小五厘、新加坡票·荷蘭票·羅比票·菲列濱票等均跌二角、日金票小七厘、朝鮮票趨勢允軟、卒以一元一角四分五厘爲同業成交價、結果軋小一分二厘、餘俱不動、</p>
<p>滬絲無新發展·昨日紐的星期無市、橫濱市况略疲、現貨一六六一元、近期一六〇五兀、遠期一六七五元、計各下跌五元、本埠絲市、無新發展、白廠四千二百元、輯里二千零九十元、昨達昌仁記有小額成交、輯里經市價巳漲起九十元、現趨勢較白廠爲堅、計做開一百五十包云、</p>
<p>開平統煤新到　開平烟煤前因航運受阻、來貨稀少、祗敷售品處應銷、故門莊店久已絕跡、日前義泰興多方疏通、辦來開平統煤三千二百噸、在洋涇浜過駁上棧、計做篩塊每噸八十元、統貨七十元，一號屑七十四元、二號屑六十七元、同　現鈔交易、送到客家、行扛另加云、鴻基煤亦有到滬　昨日太古公司綏陽輪、運來鴻基煤二千二百八十四噸、停靠法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸、</p>

<h3>越界築路諸問題　工部局申訴領團　偽方志在攫稅用意甚明領團卽將集會討論應付</h3>
<p>僞市府在滬西越界築路區域、一再派僞警侵佔捕房崗位、並在工部局所建人行道上、堆置沙袋、派僞警駐守、最近復企圖在越界築路區域、攫奪稅收、對此種種不法行爲、工部局極爲不滿，聞已向領事團提出報吿、向公共租界有關之各國總領事提出申訴、經考慮後、巳決定於最近期間、召集領團會議、商討今後應付方針、</p>
<p>偽方覬覦百萬捐稅</p>
<p>據聞僞市府之最大目的、爲攫奪該區之捐稅、今年上半年中、工部局所實收越界築路區域之房捐地稅、共爲五十二萬八千六百四十二元、而預算表中所列之全年收入、爲九十三萬一千元、此數殆將近百萬元、故日方卵翼下僞「市府」、遂思覬覦、蓋維新政府」對於偽市府」之補助費、已被停止供給也、</p>
<p>當局表示決不放棄</p>
<p>至工部局對越界築路問　所抱之態度、則爲該項馬路係工部局按照地皮章程規定之權限而購地建造者、故寓居是項馬路兩旁之住戶、應向工部局付房租及地稅、而寓居越界築路里弄之住戶、如其應用工部局所築溝管·電燈·自來水·等公用事業者、亦須　例繳付捐稅、最近僞「市府亦圖在該區收取捐稅、惟結果如何、則不得而知、</p>
<p>干涉警權捕房不理</p>
<p>工部局對於越界築路、如衛生工作。消防工作。等等、每年支用金錢甚多、截至現在、偽「市府」干擾之方式、乃爲企圖干涉工部局捕房行使其職務、僞「市府」前雖有諾言、謂祇在越界築路馬路之外行使職樣、現顯已違反其所言、最近之發展、範圍且已擴大、而圖奪取億定盤路兩紅綠燈交通崗位(一在大西路只一在愚園路口、)矣、其致捕房最後通牒、謂該處兩紅綠燈、自即日起、禁止使用、惟捕房置之不理、此乃於向居戶送捐票以外之一新不法事件</p>
<h3>菲副總統談　菲島政治</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、菲列賓羣島副總統奥斯曼那自美國返菲、道出上海、盤桓數日、今(十六日)晨接見記者時、對於新任美國駐菲辦事專員賽亞熱烈贊揚、據稱、非島人民將予賽亞以盛大歡迎、賽亞爲人賢能、渠頗欽佩、菲政府派渠赴美國、進行若干種經濟上之修正、並謀更變稅率、渠留美國時、獲與賽亞共同工作之機緣、而賽亞則予以全力襄助</p>
<p>泰定斯議案之確立</p>
<p>關於態定斯議案批準之菲島完全獨立事、奧斯曼那副總統稱、渠認爲菲島問題在政治方面已由美國會通過之法律正確解决、故渠確信除一九四六年七月四日成立完全之菲政府外、不致有其他發展矣、</p>
<p>此行僅負經濟使命</p>
<p>奧氏對於遠東與歐洲之政局、拒不加以批評惟再度聲明渠此行赴美、純係負經濟使命之性質、渠原擬自舊金山搭克利扶蘭總統號輪啟程、俾與賽亞等故友同行而未果、但渠在日本時復與賽亞相晤、同赴美駐日大使格魯之宴云、按奥斯曼那副總統在滬將勾留至星期叫日買棹赴香港、渠希望在港盤桓數日、然後乘維多利亞號輪返馬尼拉、</p>
<p>觀光滬市興趣甚濃</p>
<p>大陸報云、菲列賓羣島副總統奥斯曼那昨日(十五日)搭法輪菲力羅素號抵滬、惟昨日難悉其所在地、蓋此著名菲島政治領袖得中國友好若干人之歡迎後、大半日均耗於觀光與訪友也、奥氏下榻國際飯店、據昨夜所得消息、渠於本週中旬之前、不致啟程赴馬尼拉、此行係自日本來滬、又訊本市關係團體、將於本月十八日公宴奥氏、</p>
<h3>英在遠東設　情報分部</h3>

<h3>交通銀行撤滬各行　昨晨已告復業　改走黃浦灘路出入外傳租賃完全無稽</h3>
<p>漢口路外灘交通銀行總行舊址、被日本憲兵司令部强借後、交通銀行之撤滬各行昨起復業恢復收支、招考試用行員俟覓定地址後、即繼續辦理、惟行員補習班被迫暫停、茲誌詳情如下、</p>

<p>絕未租賃</p>
<p>交通總行舊址三四層樓、爲日方强借後、充作日憲兵司令部人員宿舍之用、均走漢口路上號之邊門出入、有電梯直達三四層樓、但曾經捕房之交涉、今日方依然盤踞未撤，外傳將提交工部局董事會議討論之說、記者昨晤某華董、知下次之董事會議議程內並未提出所以討論之說不能證實、至昨報所載交通銀行租賃消息、茲據調查、並無其事、</p>

<p>本市工商敎育慈善各團體中堅份子、嚴省三·王志誠·葉封弟·朱成甫等、鑒於近來士風日下、廉恥道喪、甚至社會上素有地位聲望之士、亦竟不顧廉恥、而爲權利所熱中、靦顏事仇、當此國難嚴重之秋、</p>

<h3>「新太古丸」駛新港　在淞口外沉沒　違背規定裝載客貨過多船身竟致破裂遽爾失事</h3>
<p>乘客四百餘人僅百餘人獲救</p>
<p>自本年三月起、行駛長江下游通·崇·啟·海·靖·各口岸之洋商輪船、不時遭遇日海軍之阻撓、以致營業一落千丈、紛紛停閉、首先行駛上述各綫之船隻、有三四十艘之多、今則祇江定·潞安·洛康·凱司登·利沙·等、不滿十艘、至靖江縣屬之口岸(即龍窩口)航運、完全被日商覇持、洋商船一概不准行駛、欲行駛口岸者、必須有日商背景、及懸掛日旗、方可航行、現下日商日淸公司所有南北洋綫長江綫等、已併人東亞海運公司、惟行駛口岸·崇明·綫之各小輪、仍由日淸公司管理、計新太古丸·大華丸·　行駛口岸綫·浙江丸·慶寗丸·行駛崇明綫、</p>
<p>昨晨出口中午沉沒</p>
<p>新太古丸儎重一百零八噸、船身長一十八呎、昨晨在外灘二號碼頭、裝儎滿船貨物及乘客四百餘人、出口赴口岸·新港·等處、不料離吳淞口十一浬處、的中午十二時四十五分、儎重既已過重、而乘客照規例祇能趁一百五十人、該輪又俄越倍、共有四百餘人、(公司承認有二百餘人)船身遂破裂下沉、失事時、</p>
<p>怡和鐵駁途遇施救</p>
<p>適有怡和洋行漢和輪（係鐵駁）由北沙滸通裝儎棉花返滬、行經該處、見新太古丸下沉、乃即駛往船邊施救、並代發電電報吿滬行、日淸公司接電後、旋即調派淸山丸小輪、於昨日下午二時許、急往施救、附近日驅逐艦一艘、亦至出事處帮同撈救、</p>
<p>出事原因至堪注意</p>
<p>聞漢和輪救起六十餘人、該輪原定昨日下午四時半抵滬、因上述關係、延至六時許、尙未到碼頭、的昨晚定能到埠、該輪出事原因、全係貨物裝儎過量、乘客過多、以致發生此不幸事件、帮助撈救之日驅逐艦、亦救起乘客四十九人、已於昨晚七時許進口、直駛南黃浦、聞有受傷旅客、由該艦分送醫院治療、</p>
<h3>氣候倐變原因　華北氣壓昇高　颶風掠過滬東海面高潮綿續水勢未退</h3>
<p>本埠天氣、因中國北部有小高氣壓影響、天氣劇變、溫度下降、風勢緊拂、而雨絲時作時輟、查昨晨十時之最高溫度降至七十一度一、前日十時則有七十五度也、</p>
<p>猛烈颶風向北疾進</p>
<p>據天文台報吿、太平洋上又起颶風、目風勢頗爲猛烈、昨晨六時已進抵北緯二十七度、東經一百二十七度之處、風力中心在六十海呷範國以內、向北北東方向疾進、查上報方位颶風已推進琉球羣島附近、咋日午後五時、天文台繼續報吿、颶風已進抵北緯二十九度、東經一百二十八度之處、中心在六十海哩範圍以內、方向仍循北北東進行、查上報方位颶風已抵日本九洲島之西南、顯將在上海以東距離四百餘海里處掠過、因之本埠氣候亦受其攪擾、終日有疾風暴雨、當風勢緊拂時共有五個風力、</p>
<p>氣候倐忽高潮綿續</p>
<p>當昨日午後四時二十分鐘、陰霾四合、天色昏暈、形成畫晦狀態、歷數分鐘之久、始稍開朗、又昨日午後三時前最高溫度祇七十二度一、而前日同時淤高溫度則有八十二度四、突降在十度以上、一日閒氣候炎凉、相去可謂懸絕、浦江昨日午後二時十分仍有高潮、數量計十一英尺以上、因之低　馬路陰溝一致　水、如南京路·浙江路·廣西路·貴州路·甘肅路·福煦路·霞飛路·薩坡賽路·極司非而路·等處、又復泛溢、</p>
<h3>凄風苦雨中　傀儡狼狽演劇　游行隊被阻中途黯然他去偽府招待來賓到者極廖落</h3>
<p>昨日爲僞「市府」成立一週紀念、爲舖張揚厲起見、昨日在各僞組織門前、大事點綴、惟天不作美、連日風雨大作、偽市府前所建之彩脾樓、已爲大風吹倒、白渡橋下本擬建一牌樓、但爲工部局所阻止、虬江路北四川路口之錐形牌樓、經凄風苦雨之吹打、亦已黯然無色、白渡橋堍及四川路橋堍所紮上書慶祝字句之紅布、已爲大風吹裂昨午十二時至七時、僞市警察局將「八一三」前之廣東大戲院、現被改爲福民大戲院者、作爲舉行游藝會之塲所、鬥前站有僞警六名、所演之節目、除武術外、多爲落伍不堪之舊劇、觀衆寥寥無幾、</p>
<p>游行被阻</p>
<p>下午三時、僞方復派卡車廿餘輛、每車載二三上身穿短褐及不整齊西裝之輩、車旁懸有白竹布橫幅慶祝字樣、車中人均手執小五色旗、太極圖旗、及五色繽紛之三角旗、行抵北四川路、欲通過四川路橋、向滬西方面駛去、待車抵四川路橋頂時、即爲南堍之守軍所阻禁止通過、一方電駐軍當局報吿、雙方磋商結果、英駐軍方面認爲如能將車上標語旗幟完全卸下、始准放行、相持至三時廿分、僞方照辦、將標語旗幟收藏、始許每次二輛、徐徐駛過四川路橋、計放行三次、共為卡車六輛</p>
<p>情態狼狽</p>
<p>不料此六輛卡車、過橋未及百武、即將標語旗幟扯起、並高呼口號、捕房方面、認爲有碍治安、即將最後之二輛扣留、押駛而去、斯時車輛亦斷絕交通、單身行人、則仍可通過、而停在橋頂之卡車、此時已駛至南堍亦爲捕探阻止、一方即電捕房、於三時三刻、開到紅色警備車兩輛、與停在南橋堍之卡車遙遙相對、情形驟見緊張、而卡車上人衆見捕房方面駛至紅色警備車，亦不甘示弱、即將丈餘之大五色旗扯起、時風狂雨急、更覺黯然無色、而一般卡車上之無知工人、更無處遷避、一種狼狽情形、殊為可憐、同時四川路六百卅號英海軍青年俱樂部門首、即開到全副武裝之英軍兩卡車、荷槍實彈、駐在門內、以防事態擴大、</p>
<p>黯然他去</p>
<p>據從北堍方面來人談、停在彼方之卡車、尙有十五輛、而武裝日軍、亦有數卡軍駛到、形勢更見緊張、此時有一日軍官、從橋北來、行至二輛紅色警備車前、前後瞻顧、並向車內探望、探捕亦不之禁、在此局面下、相峙兩小時、於五時五十分、紅色警備車始他往、移時而停在橋南堍之卡車、亦即掩旗息鼓、以决駛過、繞蘇州路而去、交通亦即恢復、</p>
<p>草草終場</p>
<p>又據外人方面消息、昨晨十時、僞「市府」在「市中心」大厦舉行成立週年紀念、偽「市長」預定招待來賓」一千五百人、但應邀而往者甚少、西人到者、有工部局總董樊克令·工部局總辦兼總裁費利溥·法捕房總巡喬貝司·工部局捕房總巡鮑恩·名律師瓊斯·德總領事費許等、英美領事、並無人前往、該處懸旗頗多、時屆十時、傳致詞後、其他僞員暨日本海陸軍官員相繼演說、入後檢閱僞警八隊、攝影而散、參加之「來賓」、除招宴外、每人均贈特製采花朶、及繫有絲帶或纓繼之銀質徽章一枚、沿途所派守衛僞警、均未携帶槍械、「松井路」即通「市中心」之主要道路、所站僞警、雖彬彬有禮、但對來賓汽車、一一須加檢查、然後放行、最後據外人方面消息、此僞方所化「慶祝」費用、竟達四十萬元之鉅、</p>
<h3>挪領尚未代理　蘇聯事務</h3>
<p>正候莫斯科來電</p>
<p>關於上海·天津·北平·張家口·等四淪陷區域之蘇聯領事館、奉令封閉、其所遺事務、則已委託上述各地之挪威領事館代理、記者昨晨復向外交界方面探悉、挪威領館迄今猶未能辦理其所代理之事務、如領事簽證。核發護照·等、聞駐滬蘇領館已電哈爾濱蘇聯領事館詢問、據哈方復電、尙須向莫斯科請示、但外交界認何時起由挪領代管、其問題並不重要、所可重視者、爲蘇聯當局採取此種措置耳、故咸信蘇日邦交、未必能因最近簽訂停戰協定而和緩、</p>
<h3>書寓內槍殺案　日竟擬提抗議　指開槍者為游擊隊</h3>
<p>大陸報云、昨（十五日)晚據日人方面傳稱、日領署當局對於星期六日夜擊傷兩日人之書寓槍擊案、擬向工部局警務處提出抗議、據日方消息、日領署官員對此罪案、調查已畢、擬在其抗議中指警務處「遏止重慶份子之活動、依然不力云、」查槍擊案發生於平望路二十六號某書寓、據警務報吿、時該書寓內有中日人數名飲酒作樂、突有華人入內開槍轟擊、東道主「特別市府公川局長」李鼎士逃出未傷、「市府」「顧問」兩日人各受槍傷、中日合辦汽車公司之董事華人一名、自二樓窗櫺躍出跌傷、妓女死傷各一、傷者計有喜多莊决、年四十、彈自左脇入腹部、池田决郞、年四十一、臉部被槍柄擊傷、華中都市汽車株式會社董事董明自樓躍下、臀部與左腿跌傷、另一日人顧問佐佐木、「市府參事」王長春、與「公用局長」李鼎士、則未傷、據若輩吿日領署警察部稱、行刺者三四人、衝入設宴之房內、高呼彼等係游擊隊、旋開槍的八發、槍彈夾住、不能放射時、即以槍柄擊池田面部云、喜多受傷後、舁入福民醫院、腹中槍彈已於星期六日夜施手術取出、的兩月後可痊愈云、</p>
<h3>美國朝野　關切遠東事件　美與遠東諸國商約延續多視中國戰爭結果而定　美駐菲專員離滬前之談話</h3>
<p>美新任駐菲最高專員賽亞氏、於十五日下午二時偕同夫人及二子乘大來公司之克利扶總統輪來滬、本埠總領事高斯。及美亞洲艦隊總司令赫德上將·等三百餘人、於是晚六時、假靜安寺路斜橋總會、爲賽氏洗塵、賽氏以接任在邇未便多事勾留、忽忽於昨晨十時携眷仍乘原輪離滬、過港赴菲履新、賽氏於輪决關於美國之一般情形、接見記者時、略作談話、茲覓得其談活辭如下、</p>
<p>美國希望保守中立</p>
<p>文明有賴於貿易、已往之偉大文化、已因其商業之被壓制而死亡、美國與遠東貿易、對於有關者、唯有有利之效果、記者叩以美國對目前歐洲之態度、賽亞答稱、美國民眾希望保守中立、惟對於民治之保持、至為關切、美國人民不欲國際混亂與以武力統治世界、美國對於戰事、能否處身局外、尚未可知、</p>
<p>美日商約類多陳舊</p>
<p>關於美日商約廢止問題、賽亞作簡略之答語稱、舊時條的、頗多不能保護美國利益者、廢約旣須相當時間、故乃通知日政府、美國已决定更換陳舊之條的、而使之適合近代之用、以期調整國際貿易與利益、</p>
<p>締約各國待遇均等</p>
<p>約一年前、美國已與英法兩國締結極好之商的、並與瑞士·挪威·及拉丁美利堅諸國締結商的、此等商的乃以貿易待遇均等爲基礎、而規定反對歧視之貿易障碍、此種新制度、業已表明其結果、即貿易增多、與保護美國對各國之輸出是也、對於保護美國與有利於他國之商的、作最誠摯之接近事、刻正盡全力推進中、</p>
<p>遠東航運應予維持</p>
<p>或以今交參院討論之畢德門中立法修正案所規定限制美國航運事爲叩者、賽亞除稱、渠希望美國在遠東之航運能予維持、而不受阻碍以外、拒不討論此事、惟表示其確切之見解、卽美國一般貿易有維持之必要是、關於此點、賽亞指出世界文明、有賴於貿易、並舉出已往與目下因貿易而佔優勢地位之大貿易國、而檢討度强盛的國家之衰落、乃因失其貿易所致、故美國與遠東貿易有維持之必要、</p>
<p>遠東事件</p>
<p>極端關切</p>
<p>或問金氏所提對畢德門議案之修正案、將吾得參院之贊同、賽亞對此並未發言、查金氏修正案若經通過、則將撤銷提議中對遠東美國航運之限制、賽亞賡續對遠東事件發表言論稱、美國民衆對中國深爲關懷、縱歐戰爆發、此種關切、並未稍减、美國與遠東諸國商的之延續、多視中國戰爭之結果而定、中國戰爭未解決、則對於商的、卽無詳　接近之間題、</p>
<p>菲島問題未作批評</p>
<p>或問渠對菲島事務、與目前之獨立議案經修正後、美國有續握菲島主權的司能性、見解如何、賽亞未發確切之言、惟承認此項問題、刻正在硏究中、渠今不能發表言論、至渠對於菲島事務確定發言論時、當在馬尼刺而不在上海發表之、渠所將注意之許多問題中、其一即重行硏究菲島之獨立問題、此刻渠尙無特殊硏究此項問題之計劃、渠對於所傳菲島盼獲獨立、而保持經濟優先權、如古巴然、亦不願加以批評、</p>
<p>賽亞夫婦在滬小游</p>
<p>按賽亞昨日抵滬、前往歡迎者有美國亞洲艦隊總司令赫德海軍大將、與美總領事高斯、賽亞於接見新聞記者後、乘赫德大將之座艇登岸、然後偕其夫人在本市作觀光之行、高斯旋在哥侖比亞總會設宴款待賽亞與其夫人、該招待會係非正式性質、曾公開請本市美僑參加、與會者的三百人、賽亞原任國務卿帮辦、此决偕其夫人與兩孩來遠束、同行者尙有其法律顧問裴爾夫婦、行政助理員惠魯佩夫婦、暨私人秘書格雷、與紐康女士、</p>

<h3>大學生爲非作歹　嚇詐同學被捕　供認結黨恐嚇庭諭收押</h3>
<p>常州青年過家容（今年二十一歲）、及巢慰祖（今年十九歲）、與本地人陸暁風（今年十九歲）、寗波人顔文奎（今年十九歲）等、向在某某雨大學肄業、因爲時常涉足舞塲、致家長所供給之金錢、不敷揮霍之用、過家容與現在卡德路中國職業學校肄業之本地人朱兆根、從</p>
<p>前係學友</p>
<p>朱係小康之家、因此過家容乃與陸暁風·巢慰祖·顔文奎·等串通、於本月十二日至法租界潘聲路七十七號朱家、將朱兆根喚出、在馬路上散步談天、過家容謂從前有一個同學名張勇、現因參加游擊隊工作、被日方捕去、而陸暁風口操日語、其裝扮亦似日人、顔文奎隊</p>
<p>自充繙譯</p>
<p>謂該日人（指墮暁風）係在日軍中供職、據稱張勇被捕後、供詞中指朱兆根爲同黨、現在日方亦要緝拿朱光根、當時過家容即表示驚駭、問朱兆根如何對付、朱亦深感不安、顔文奎等遂績稱、請這位日本朋友（指陸暁風）帮忙、不致擴大、陸暁風仍操日語表示意見、過家容等向朱兆根日、</p>
<p>此事非小</p>
<p>至少需要五百元、方可了事、朱兆要當時苦苦哀求、結果決定三百二十元了案、但朱一時無此鉅款、僅會給過家容等三十元、其餘約定本月十五日晚間付清、過家容等携款三十元、共同吃飯用去十元、尚餘二十元各分五元、而朱兆根付款之後、報告家長、</p>
<p>始知受騙</p>
<p>乃據情報告法租界捕房、請求查究、法捕房據報、乃筋大批中西探於約定繼　付款之時間內、前往守候、居時過家容等四人、果按時前往取款、當被探捕一併逮捕、帶入捕房、昨日午後二時許由斡探徐金龍等押解第二特院刑一庭、聲請　押偵查、當由張民生推事</p>
<p>升座提訉</p>
<p>被告家容供稱、本月十二日因爲同學顔文奎來借款、當時被告亦無錢、後來一同找朱兆根同學遊玩、適有朋友陸暁風、貌似東洋人、且與朱兆根同學不相識、井且知道張勇係朱之要好朋友、張已被捕、故被告等臨時想出向朱兆根同學借錢之方法、</p>
<p>井非預謀</p>
<p>繼據陸暁風供、我祇說幾句日本話、別樣工作我不管、又據顔文奎巢慰祖等供、均承認參與恐嚇詐財、庭上又向告訴人略訉一過、即諭知被告均收押、改期十月二十五日再訊、</p>

<h3>詩與克服自然　—讀書隨—  霜長</h3>
<p>人類的進化是由於勞動，勞動之後才會產生文化。「哎唷杭唷」原是工作太辛苦了才呼喊出來的；聲音的是單純的，但由此，就產出了詩歌之類的東西。很久以前，那種勞動的呼聲早衍化而爲樸實的詩歌了。我閃哼「擊壤歌」就可想見那時人們生活在大自然裏，祇爲生活需要而自由勞動。</p>
<p>尭舜的社會變動了，到「慶雲歌」時代，氏族社會組織逐漸完密，生產工具改良着，生活方式也因之進步，且進一步地反抗自然，禹等治水「隨山刋木，決九川，距四海」，造成了人類的奇蹟。而「阜陶謨」正是一種上下勉惕的勞動的呼聲。然而那時人類雖然初步戰勝了自然，終還未脫它底羈絆，詠「帝戰歌」就可見到對於自然的觀念。</p>
<p>人類對於自然的關係，在以後詩歌的發展上有着大影響。禹以後，生產經濟的興盛揚來了採集經濟，這個關係越發加强了。人類在種榷上更發覺了自然的神秘，便以爲隱隱中有神的存在在主宰一切。他們在勞動之餘便產生着一種祀神的諂媚舉動，（連帶地諂媚統治者）這正和古希臘時代賽會　演四弦琴詩一樣。後來楚辭中稱爲屈原所作的「九歌」，原是相同於那時的祭祀歌，終究還不免於神秘。詩經「頌」的謳歌自然騅在表面上說是爲自己所熟知的祖宗用的，但還是孔子爲了不夠理解自然之道，因之諱歌自然怪力亂神的一種諱　的作用。</p>
<p>無疑地，某種詩歌發展到現在還尗擺脫這類的因素，中間給惡勢力便利不少，雖然原先是由勞動的呼聲出發的。時代發展着，對於自然的熊度逐漸變更了，但這裏也有着質量的差異。「時日曷衷，予及汝偕亡！」的呼喊終嫌太少，在過程中很多讓「我不知道風向什麼方向吹！」塡塞了。人類的憤恨在歷史上有很多的表現：「赤日炎炎似火焼，田中禾苗半枯焦」一直到「被壓迫者一起揮動拳頭」，他們要反抗自然，克服惡勢力。而這路程是艱苦的。</p>
<p>克服惡勢力，已有好些詩人提到；關於自然呢，人們多未能獨往。時代的歌唱者高爾基在「詩的主題」中會舉一例：</p>
<p>……但是你喲，忘懹了神，</p>
<p>生呑壓抑者兩足的建築者喲，</p>
<p>你要選擇……螞蟻或市民？</p>
<p>你溶合着罷，螞蟻和市民，</p>
<p>那末勞動的大衆，</p>
<p>…我們學習自然，</p>
<p>一面學習，一面敎導自然。</p>
<p>高氏以爲：這詩雖很拙劣地還表現詩人有着革命哲學者底最有價値的觀念，但人類不單是學習和敎導自然，而是要愈加勇敢地使自然底原素的力，跟從我們底理性和意志底力，我們一躍而爲自然底支配者，造成自己底「第二自然」。</p>
<p>自然也應該克服的啊！</p>
<p>我們握着這個觀點來理解詩歌，我們便能理解歷史；而對於某種傳統的單純地崇拜，讚嘆自然更有正確嚴格的評價了。</p>

<h3>都魯河畔的淘金者  朱章</h3>
<p>榠櫨樹钩住了都魯河上的夕陽，欹斜在不平的山路上迎着蕭寥西风的碎響。從蘿北的原野里，飄傳來幾聲轆轆的驢車聲。</p>
<p>河從衆疊的風屏中流來，下面的黃沙在紆紆地漾動。每天的早晨露霧還未退盡，在河上就有許多儔侶，來俯着首默默地搜尋他們的生活，直到夜晚，他們綫撑了樺子回去。</p>
<p>又是黎明了，一陣掠過白石搭頂的　風，把河吹醒，牠把輕紗般的衣裙浮動了。一羣活潑的孩子挾着　袋奔來，在河面上親了個吻，他們把手　於河的懹抱裏，牠有時便把一掌沙質而蘊有夢般富貴的東西塞在孩子們的手裏，孩子們雀躍地，連眼涙都流了，感謝河啊。</p>
<p>「沒有爸爸的小雜種走開！」河上突然有一個流着眼涙的孩子，在這一旬威脅中漸漸地退後，河的芳息全沾在一個怒目的孩子的　裏。</p>
<p>一個紅衣女孩子拉着滿面苦愁的婦人，慢慢地向這里來，走到在嗚咽的孩子邊，提起紫着布條的手顦顇地說：「孩子誰又欺侮你了！」</p>
<p>孩子的嗚咽放大而至號淘了：「他　罵……我媽媽，」孩子投在婦人的懹里了。</p>
<p>「沒有爸爸的小雜種，沒有丈夫的寡婦，直開！」剛才的兇孩子，又高聲地嚷起來。</p>
<p>「唉，沒有爸爸的孩子？」婦人對着被厚雲蓋住的太陽，流着二滴豆顆大的眼涙疑　了一句。</p>
<p>嗤嗤的淘沙聲，仍在四周響着，誰在望了幾眼不發一聲，—她感到眞理委實太可憐了</p>
<p>「孩子—」婦人拭乾了涙。把哭着的男孩與女孩擺後一些</p>
<p>“一代之　，百世之遇。”—秋</p>
<h3>希望  品品</h3>
<p>希望像什麼？旅途的宿店，沙漠裏的綠洲，還是浩海中的燈塔？我說不出，但我知道世界上總有這麼一個希望—你大槪暁得潘獨娜的故事的。</p>
<p>討厭的是，潘獨娜的箱子藏在那兒？痛苦，災難，失敗，疾病，逃了出來，散佈人間，人人看得見（也許牠們會來看你，驟然地。）希望，慶幸地沒有逃走，關在箱子裏，這個箱子爲什麼找不到？到底給潘獨娜藏在什麼秘密的地方！</p>
<p>人家因爲找不到希望而悲哀了，甚至咒罵了：</p>
<p>希望是什麼？是娼妓：</p>
<p>她對誰都疊惑，將一切都獻給；</p>
<p>待你犧牲了極多的實貝—</p>
<p>你的青春—她就葉掉你。</p>
<p>—Petofi　Sandor</p>
<p>別這樣，好人！試想：假使希望眞給罵走，我們將變成怎樣？失了宿店，我們將　泊以終；乾了綠洲，我們將枯竭而死；沒有燈塔，我們將像盲人一樣空自摸案。希望給我閃歸宿，安慰，光明。人希望飛，發展了：人希望吃，麦大了。靠了希望，我們進步我們生存。全自然界如果沒有希望，太陽落了也不想再昇，花草枯了也不想再生，自然就此死亡。</p>
<p>懶惰是希望的敵人，勤奮是希望的朋友。懶惰不要希望（也許有一些夢，夢可不是希望，）希望不去就他。勤奮要希望，他用力量去找—鋤破地面，剷平太石—於是汗水中，在鮮血下，希望與他相會。</p>
<p>我們不必失望，當今只有一個希望，希望祖國勝利，前面已現曙光，伸臂去取呀，不過你先得揮汗流血！去吧，希望來了，去迎接！</p>
<p>，對着還在咕噥的孩子說：「他的爸爸確是沒有了，沒有了七八年了，他的爸爸死在這塲主的一方的牙齦里，是的他是死的那麼的悽慘；然而你的爸爸—還活着啊？有爸爸的孩子是幸福的，哦，爲咱們的仇人作事的爸爸是比不幸的爸爸更快活麼？」婦人的聲浪提高了，而且把四周的淘沙聲都弄得停止了。—</p>
<p>「唉，苦了沒有爸爸的孩子了。不過咱們的孩子們，你們幾個眞是有爸爸的？孩子們你們說，」</p>
<p>幾十百行的熱涙，都從眼角里滾出來了，—這是幾百隻滿生着一縷縷創痕的眼啊，「……」連她亦哭了，哭得興奮。兇孩子面孔更紅了，他的鞋也給沾濕了。</p>
<p>「對的，你們都是沒有爸爸而祇有沒用的媽媽的孩子，但是你們要你爸麼？喜歡你們和藹的爸爸麼？！唉孩子們，你們的爸爸都不會回來的囉。但是，你們長大了，便可知道爸爸……爸爸是常存在你們聰明明腦子里！……」</p>
<p>「對啊，爸爸？沒有爸爸的孩子—」一陣激烈的吼聲像要把對面皚皚的白雪壓溶似的。</p>
<p>一個武裝的黃衣兵荷着槍奔過來：「襲些什麼？」</p>
<p>這時一隻隻的手漸漸的放下了，高潮退了，唯見晶瑩的流沙上面浮着　袋。</p>
<p>「哦，孩子們，想爸爸麼，」黃衣兵見空氣靜了，便說：「作完了工，讀完下書，去見爸爸去，乖一些。哦！老婆子你莫妨碍工作，爲了他們要早此見爸爸……哈哈……嘿嘿……哈哈，」</p>
<p>孩子們滿眶眼涙走了，慢慢地離開河的懹抱，他們在遠處去領十個銅子的酬勞。一個孩子不一會冷靜地走回來，呆立在河邊。他似在咒念。「摸……」一連串在夕陽里發亮的圓片子驟然落在河身上：「尋爸爸用不到這臭銅子，—」</p>
<p>夜色朦朧的都魯河上，撞着的樺子都走盡了，河猛力地送個巨浪：漰漰漰……</p>
<p>明天，在太陽下，一個黃衣兵，偏促在河的身邊。焦急啊。河微微地發了聲苦哭！</p>
<p>「多謝我們的都魯河，把我們呌醒，我們將永不淘你的流沙了，珍重罷！」黃衣兵彷彿聽到一陣孩子底歌聲，他已不能重溫繁華的舊夢了啊。</p>
<p>（註）都魯河位於黑省蘿北之西南，產鎏砂。</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>改編“情海疑雲”的經過　  于伶</h3>
<p>本劇係根據John　Galsworthy的“The　show”改編。匆匆執筆，能有較長的時間，坐在自己的書桌邊，翻翻字典的機會苦於太少，得方光　先生譯文的方便，甚至借用的地方頗多，還是該聲明，並　謝的。－方先生譯名“一場熱鬧”，為開明英漢對譯本。</p>
<p>原劇三幕，第一幕雨景。在目前中國舞臺上，換景困難，我就乾脆地把它換為四幕劇了。改編是為“上海劇藝社”今年春天在“新光戲院”作星期早場實驗公演用的。因為演出時間與舞台裝置的限制，我把原劇第二幕的第一景－報館場面取消了。現在“上海劇藝社”將作為長期公演中劇目之一，重讀第二　的油印本後，特為補上付梓，以求完整。</p>
<p>關於內容的所以要改動，完全是為了“此時此地”的演出，但求較為更可能地接觸與關聯些“那個”。尚祈高明的John　Galsworthy研究者恕我！</p>
<p>關於他，中國已有很早很多的介紹，今春“上海劇藝社”還演過他的“最先與最後”。關於“The　show”方先生在“一場熱鬧”序中已有祥確的說明，這兒從略了。</p>
<p>以上是把本劇本題為“滿城風雨”出版時的後記。</p>
<p>現在“上海劇藝社”把它改編為“情海疑雲”，　“武則天”之後，在“　宮劇院”公演了。講到題名，這確是一件頗受斟酌的事兒，方先生曾想把　做“吠影吠聲”，“　　”，“騷援”，“賣野人頭”，“XXXX的自殺案”等等，終於譯作“一場熱鬧”。我在改編之初，依據鬧得滿城風雨這意思，改為“滿城風雨”，“上海劇藝社”因故未能演出之後，就改為“柳暗花明”預告到現在，意思是劇中案件鬧來鬧去，終於大白，如柳暗花明後之又一邨，就因為這第三幕結束時“又一邨”的劇情不能通過，不能不把被殺又改回來，改成自殺。於是連帶把題名第三段改為“情海疑雲。”顧名思義，這次演出似將偏重於偵探活動方面吧。想着這，我又重感着“鉛樣的心情”了。對於此時此地的演劇活動，對於原作者偉大的高爾斯　　！</p>
<h3>沒有男星的影片  靜遠</h3>
<p>自縱有電影以來，完全由女明星主演的影片只有一張，那就是米高梅最近攝製完竣的“女人”（“The　Women”），這張影片由好萊塢一百三十位女星合作，瑙瑪希拉，瓊克勞馥，羅撒玲洛塞兒，高蓮賓黛和瓊芳泰妮領銜，導演是鼎鼎大名的喬治考克。全片的特色就是沒有一個男角，只有在末了的鏡頭里　出一個男人的背景而已。</p>
<h3>酒店話滄桑無限感謂　一代武生楊瑞亭  天馬</h3>
<p>－卅年粉墨生涯將年華消逝了</p>
<p>三十年前，平劇界中的長　武生，北京楊小樓，天津尚和玉，是曾一代馳名。那時，在後起的雛鳳裹，李吉瑞和楊瑞亭也是佼佼著名的藝人。</p>
<p>可是，三十年來，粉墨的生涯把它的年華像流水樣的輕輕消逝，死的死了，老的老了，即是閃燦一代的楊瑞亭也已經鶴髮童顏年紀五十開外了。最近瑞亭自天津來滬，記者晤之於市樓，他的精神還留有當年的剛健，他爽然大笑。</p>
<p>“十七層樓的永安公司巨　，十餘年前，正是我在上海夠勁兒的舊地　！”</p>
<p>他似乎不勝滄桑，順便告訴我那是天　的原址，同時今日“　　中”旅舍是從前的“亦舞亭”，據知音者談及那時楊瑞亭的聲譽真是不可一世，其“鐵　山”，“長板坡”，“拿高登”，“　安州”等名劇，可稱古今絕唱，至今猶在戲迷們的腦　中呢！</p>
<p>八一三以前，楊瑞亭曾在黃金一度登臺，以一個文武全材的老生姿態出演，他的聲譽，他的技藝，自然是轟動一時，但，這　年來，爲了上海的烽火，他北上天津，這次　　來滬，據說是受了新　劇場的電邀方聯合譚派老生與荀慧生在亦　　合配過的王清麗一同來滬了。</p>
<h3>第一部佛教片　“觀世音”上銀幕  無量</h3>
<p>近藝　公司又傾其全力籌攝一佛教鉅片“觀世音”，三四年前，王一亭先生健在時，曾對藝華主人數度言之，謂西片甚多宣揚宗教者，獨中國電影對佛教上貢獻尚付缺如，並提出“觀世音”攝成電影，其對於佛學界當有極大貢獻云。蓋中國以文盲眾多，佛教雖普及於鄉村僻壤，然均知其然不知其所以然，殊不知佛學中含有極深奧之精神意識，即如“觀世音”，就道言之，佛徒有六和五德，非僅修道而已。故藝華對此片攝製，當處以極謹慎，極嚴緊態度，並聞聘請佛學上極有修養之名人共同研究，冀解剖佛教之真諦，使國人對佛教有深切的認識也。</p>
<h3>王玉蓉來滬先聲  唯唯</h3>
<p>金仲仁　朱斌仙　孫甫亭　貫盛習同來</p>
<p>黃金新角王玉蓉，安舒元，將於下月初旬登臺，除安舒元早已來滬外。王玉蓉將搭下班盛京輪南下，與王同來者，尚有配角金仲仁，朱斌仙，貫盛習，裘盛戎，孫甫亭，等人。</p>
<p>貫盛習　裘盛戎離滬未久，滬人對此二人，已有相當認識，金仲仁則久未來滬矣，此次玉蓉南來，因本戲中之小生，非仲仁不可，仲仁乃隨王同來。仲仁之小生，在今日故都　圈中，與程　仙　姜妙香，同稱小生三老，其藝已臻爐火純青之境，演方巾戲，更有獨到，十三妹之安公子，堪稱為一絕，固一典型人物也。朱斌仙坐科斌慶社，當隨李萬春來滬，惟予滬人印象不深，斌仙長於演玩笑丑戲，雖稍有大舌之弊，但能響堂，晚近丑角人才輩出，但能響堂者，並不多得。斌仙年來頗多進步，馬富祿離慶生社後，荀慧生視之如左右手，孫甫亭工老旦，久隨梅蘭芳　荀慧生，去歲嘗一度隨程硯秋來滬，金朱孫三人，皆慧生之班底。此次金等隨王玉蓉來滬，影響慧生演戲頗大，惟慧生亦與黃金有約，將接王玉蓉之後　，是故慧生毅然肯放金等南來，蓋金等演畢後，將暫不北返，　慧生來滬後，再一同登臺也。</p>
<p>現在黃金出演之武生吳彥衡，亦玉蓉之老搭檔，玉蓉既將來滬，黃金當局乃對吳加以挽留。此外裘盛戎來滬與否，尚有問題，黃金方面，已商得袁世海之同意，吳袁二人已定蟬聯。</p>
<p>至於老伶工王瑤卿偕玉蓉同來之說，是否能成事實，尚成問題，瑤卿確有南來之意，惟恐各界要求串演，蓋今日之瑤卿，已不願再粉墨登臺也。黃金當局，亦極盼瑤卿能來，並聲明決不堅邀客串，此事已由趙桐珊（芙蓉草）代表演黃金致函瑤卿，容有確息，再告讀者</p>
<p>依洛娜曼仙試唱着半高音的歌，下面舉杯的是納爾遜　第。</p>
<p>梨園外紀</p>
<h3>員外貝勒候補道</h3>
<p>我從前說過，凡吃戲飯的，只要能把自己的孺名（北人謂之奶諱）及外號創開咧，呌響啦，那就不怕不紅的。同時京城　一般老於　曲的人們，偏又極樂意把名角兒的真名字隱起而　提他們的奶諱綽號，以示其熟知伶人家世，譬如人家說“余世琴的十三妹”不錯，他必定要接着說道：“莊兒這　戲簡直沒有對；”再有人說：“俞菊生的長板坡工架真老練；”他遂又接着說道：“當然　，這是毛包的看家戲呀。”此外還有那些好充老資格的，其實他自個才不過狗大的年紀，每於　到蘭芳叔岩諸人時，總是小梅小余的不離口，一言以蔽之，這都是北平那　崇尚封建思想的人們所樂意擺的“　　罷了。擺譜”就是自高身分，端架子，　　滬語中“神氣活現”的意思。</p>
<p>從前社會上既是風行着　　喊孺名呼外號的習慣，所以伶人們不但不以此為恥。反而覺得這是光榮體面的事兒。當孫佐臣在世的時候，有一天他拿着大紅的名片給我拜年，我一　上面印着孫光通三個大字，旁邊尚有佐臣兩個小字，我很詫異的問他道：“孫光　這個名字　很少見呀。他即很高興的答道：“可不是麼，我自個的意思，倒不如把我的小名兒“老元這兩個字印在名片上，那真是通國皆知，省得人家　猜疑。”他說這話時的確是一副正經面孔而且帶着很得意的神情，於此就可見他們是如何　視其已被社會上呌響的孺名兒了。後來尚有那位先生硬要把老元的老字改成“　”字，以自炫淵博，那真是笑話奇譚了，同時善繪鼻煙壺的　　　也不願把他的名字隨便給別人的。（一二O）</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Delivers Instructions to Students; Resolutely Fulfilling the Responsibility of Saving the Country and Assisting in the Realization of the Three Principles of the People</h3>
<p>Chongqing: This morning, in the brilliant sunshine of the Central Military Academy, Chairman Chiang delivered an inspiring and impassioned speech to student delegations representing various universities in China and student delegations from the Central Military Academy and other schools to encourage Chinese youth. He briefly stated that the strength of our country now depends on noble youth and upright citizens. Every student must resolutely fulfill his responsibility of saving the country against Japanese aggression and assist in the implementation of the Three Principles of the People so that China can achieve independence and freedom. Today, the troops at the front are sacrificing their lives to free China from brutal oppression. Therefore, every citizen must resolutely express the same spirit of sacrifice to avenge the nation's shame. Thereupon, the entire assembly loudly recited the Party Members' and Soldiers' Twelve Commitments and Ten Admonitions to Chairman Chiang. Chairman Chiang then spoke earnestly about the need for mutual assistance, saying that old and young, rich and poor, if everyone helps others within their scope, then China will never become a disunited mess, but will be closely interwoven to achieve strength. One of China's past weaknesses was that many people selfishly sought their own happiness and put the happiness of their compatriots behind them. Chairman Chiang concluded his instructions to the students of the military academy by saying that when practicing, they should treat the people courteously and not damage their property. The representatives of the various universities who attended all carried the flags of their respective schools, and the number of people was very large, making it a grand occasion.

(3) The methods of governance will first emphasize political education and resolutely emphasize defense. (4) Actively prepare for local autonomy, vigorously implement the baojia system, and limit the implementation to begin from the third blade of next year. (5) In addition to the Party, government, military, and academia, local gentry should also be jointly responsible for abstaining from opium and gambling and suppressing bandits, and should be allowed to guide society and reform bad habits to take the construction of Sichuan and the rejuvenation of the nation as their own responsibility. (6) In terms of organization, in addition to the baojia system, people's groups in various industries should be organized as soon as possible, and all training and propaganda should be centered on educational institutions, supervising educational personnel and students to take responsibility for promotion. (7) The National Association should focus on implementation. Teachers and students of various schools should lead the people to implement the general mobilization program of the spirit, and should pay attention to hygiene and etiquette. (8) Regulate finance and develop the economy, share burdens, share labor and leisure, teach the people to be rich through labor, and teach the people to be strong through strictness.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Review of Japan's Economic Strategy Towards China</h3>
<p>The aggression of modern countries takes economics as the sole goal. However, Japan's aggression towards China simultaneously encompasses political, military, and economic objectives. Although economics was an important component in its initial consciousness, the irrational development of facts has transformed it into politics and military as the primary focus, with economics as secondary. This is no longer modern aggression, but a complete, primitive plunder. This can be distinguished not only by analyzing the nature of its policies, but also by verifying its accuracy with various small actions in the occupied areas of China. Of course, this is what Japan is unwilling to admit, but the problem lies in the form of facts, not in willingness or unwillingness. Even if Japan does not recognize aggression at all, even economic aggression, it only needs new factual forms in the future to provide counter-evidence, without waiting for Japan's denial.</p>
<p>Japan unconsciously placed excessive emphasis on politics and the military. Political conspiracies and military offensives have not succeeded, and its economic strategies have also failed. The so-called political conspiracy is based on the tone of "using Chinese to control Chinese." The so-called military offensive takes quick battles and quick decisions as the strategy. The so-called economic strategy is not the looting of small actions, but the establishment of the "North China Development Corporation" and the "Central China Revitalization Corporation." (In South China, operations are temporarily entrusted to the "Taiwan Colonization Corporation," which is small in scale and will not be discussed here.)</p>
<p>The North China and Central China companies were "formally established" on November 7 last year, with the same mission as the "South Manchuria Railway Company" in the four eastern provinces, that is, what the Japanese call "national policy companies." The former has a capital of 350 million Japanese yen: the business plan is divided into (1) transportation and ports (2) postal and telecommunications (3) power generation (4) minerals (5) salt manufacturing, sales and utilization, etc. The latter has a capital of 100 million Japanese yen: the business plan is divided into (1) railways (2) water transport (3) communications (4) radio broadcasting (5) electricity and tap water (6) minerals (7) Shanghai public utilities (8) aquatic products, etc. (As for the cotton planting industry, which is the main resource in North China, it is controlled by another "North China Cotton Company.") Judging from the business plans of the two companies, it seems that everything is included, and the resources of North and Central China can be grasped at once. Unfortunately, the fact is quite different.</p>
<p>Facts led to his failure: First, the military occupation area is not only temporarily occupied in international law, but it is not that the area can be occupied as one's own property when the force is reached; and in various objective conditions, only points and lines are occupied, and the "surface" cannot be occupied stably. As evidence of the repeated cutting of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, it can be seen that the so-called line is by no means stable; furthermore, as evidence that Hunan, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Hubei, and other provinces, once counterattacked by the Chinese army, have recovered several rivers, mountains, towns, and cities, it can also be seen that the so-called point is by no means stable. Japan placed excessive emphasis on the military, and the points and lines occupied by the military could not be grasped, so how could the economic strategy attached to the military be implemented?</p>
<p>Second, in China, economic facilities require the cooperation of the Chinese people as a factual necessity. In the military-occupied areas, Japan's power is enough to deter the Chinese in the occupied areas who have no weapons and no money. However, in the past two years, Japan's massacres and small actions, not to mention the sadness, anger, resentment, and poison of the Chinese in the occupied areas, are at least respected and kept at a distance. How can we achieve the so-called cooperation? The puppets who follow the Japanese, regardless of their consciousness, ability, or even "status," are fundamentally unworthy to be one party in the cooperation between the two parties. Furthermore, imagining the Japanese side's idea, they will never regard the Chinese in the occupied areas as friends who can confide in each other and conspire to achieve mutual benefit; they treat each other like masters and servants, and defend against each other like thieves. How can they invest? How to establish economic relations? How can they promote their economic strategy?</p>
<p>Third, the Japanese side has no way. The capital of the North China and Central China companies is said to be 350 million yen and 100 million yen respectively; at first glance, it seems that it is not too little, but it is actually very weak to undertake the various projects in its plan. And in fact, the capital contributed by the Japanese government, except for the so-called "in-kind shares," is extremely small: most of it is waiting for Japanese private investment, but private investors are neither reassured nor interested in this investment. (The North China Company's private shares are divided into 3.5 million shares, and only 100,000 shares are publicly raised. The Central China Company's private shares are divided into 100,000 shares, but there are 9,770 shareholders!) The results are so miserable that it has to adopt the method of issuing company debentures; who knows who will buy the bonds? Everything is hitting a wall, so after discussions between the Tokyo government and various related parties, it is believed that the Japanese government has no way to assist North China, Central China, and the "Manchuria Five-Year Development Plan." As a result, its planned policy had to be changed. The board of directors of the North China Company met in Beiping and decided to amend the organizational law, and in the future, all facilities should be limited to satisfying local needs, and no longer based on the plan preset by Tokyo. In other words, in the future, the Tokyo side will only take a hands-off attitude towards economic development plans in mainland China, and all projects must be supported by the two companies themselves; if Tokyo's assistance is necessary, it will be limited to those that directly generate profits that can be compensated. Facts have proved that Japan's economic strategy towards China under aggression has failed! Gold and stone calligraphy and painting, mahogany tables and chairs, although they have been effectively carried back full of small actions; this can be said to be quite successful in primitive looting; but in modern economic aggression, it is not as valuable.</p>
<h3>British and French Allied Forces Stand Ready to Defend Against German Attack; French Artillery Bombards German Concentration Points; Large Numbers of German Troops Head to the Front Lines Overnight</h3>
<p>Paris: Anticipating a large-scale German attack on the British and French Allied Forces within the week, it is reported that the British and French Allied Forces have completed their preparations to meet the enemy. It is rumored that Hitler's headquarters have moved to the western front today. It is expected that the German side will use large numbers of tanks, bombers, and fighter jets as its main force in the offensive. According to observers here, if the German side attacks, it will inevitably be on the Saar front, while the Rhine front, where the river is very rapid, and the main railway bridges have been bombed and destroyed by the French army, making it very difficult for the German side to advance. As for the front east of Luxembourg, the mountainous terrain is rugged and the forests are dense, making it even more difficult for the tanks that Hitler relies on as his weapons to be used. The western front was cloudy and foggy on Sunday, with not much activity. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters has just issued War Bulletin No. 84, stating, "There are frequent movements in the enemy's positions between the Moselle and Saar Rivers. Patrols of both enemy and our forces are active near the city of Weissenburg." (16th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris: German troops have been concentrating along the Moselle River and in the Hardt Forest for days, appearing ready for a large-scale offensive. French artillery has been shelling the enemy's concentration points and rear areas along the entire 100-kilometer front since late last night, with great force. Yesterday, the front was very quiet, and the German artillery was also silent. This is no different from the situation before the previous attacks. The French headquarters sent out reconnaissance teams to scout around and ambushed at the end of the Hardt Forest, often capturing several enemy soldiers. In the evening, French army and air force observers discovered that the enemy's rear was extremely active, and transportation on the roads leading to the front was also very frequent. Listening quietly with sound detection machines from the French positions, the sound was clear and distinguishable. The French authorities then took preemptive action and bombarded it with fierce artillery fire. (16th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris: According to reports from French observation posts and front-line guards, the German front and rear were unusually active last night. The ten-mile road from the front to the rear was illuminated by searchlights, indicating that road transportation was very busy. Cars used their headlights to give light to advancing troops or vehicles without lights. Torches flashed all night along the front lines, indicating that troops were arriving and being distributed to various positions, and officers were examining maps to find the assigned defensive points. The sound of engines was very loud in various rear areas, indicating that heavy tanks and heavy trucks were densely moving forward. According to custom, troops are transferred to the front-line positions 24 hours before they intend to take the offensive, so there seems to be no doubt that the German army will take the offensive, or it can be said that it has already begun. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Although the German National Socialists are unwilling to tell the truth to the residents of the Rhineland, the people of the Rhineland have been greatly shaken by the French army pressing on the border. It is rumored that more than two million residents have been evacuated, which is truly an experience that the Germans have not had in more than a hundred years. The French army's occupation of German territory also has a huge economic impact. The French air force and artillery have caused various industries in the Saar region to come to a standstill, and Germany has not been able to obtain a large amount of coal and iron from this area. According to observers in London, German propaganda often says that the progress of the French army on the western front is minimal, and towns such as Saarbrücken, within two miles of the border, are still in German hands. The Siegfried Line is also far from the front line, and this line is intact except for being shelled. Germany obviously wants the British and French Allied forces to make a frontal attack and suffer many casualties. However, in the initial stage of the current war situation, it is not important for the army to go deep. The British and French Allied forces have learned from the bitter experience of the European war, and are currently fighting steadily and steadily, making a systematic encirclement. This tactic has achieved very valuable results at a very small price. Saarbrücken is an important intersection of roads and railways, and is now surrounded on three sides by the French army. All roads and railways are within the range of French artillery fire stably positioned on the high ground. The French army is not eagerly occupying this town, because the occupation of this town may not increase the French army's advantage, but only make the army ambushed or hand-to-hand combat, resulting in unnecessary casualties. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin: This afternoon, the German military headquarters announced that once the German army has completely occupied all areas within the scope of German interests in the former Polish territory, the German military headquarters will stop publishing reports on the eastern front. As for the western front, there is only a small-scale war with little artillery fire. On the Rhine River, the French army, which has built strong fortresses southwest of Stahstad, has been forced to withdraw due to rising river water. (16th Haitong Dispatch)</p>

The crew numbers between one thousand and fifteen hundred. (Haitong, 16th)</p>
<p>London – German radio has broadcast news claiming that the British battleship HMS Repulse (displacing 22,000 tons) has been sunk by German submarines using torpedoes. British naval officials have denied this claim. This, along with the German claim that the British battleship HMS Hood was sunk last night, is also fabricated. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>London – The French mail steamer "Brazza" (10,000 tons) and the steamer "Louisiane" (7,000 tons) were sunk by German submarines on the 14th of this month in the Atlantic Ocean. British warships immediately sailed to rescue the passengers and crew, totaling 400 people, including many women and children. Only fifteen people are missing. Survivors who landed in a British port this afternoon said that the "Louisiane" was intercepted by a German submarine that demanded supplies. The captain refused, and the submarine opened fire, killing the first mate. Several women and children were also injured. Seven passengers on the "Brazza" died, and many lifeboats were damaged by gunfire and rendered unusable. Many passengers had to swim in the water until rescued by British warships after swimming for over an hour and a half. (Havas, 15th)</p>

<p>London – The British ship "Arvondale," carrying six passengers and sixty-two crew members from the United States to Britain, was sunk by a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean on the 14th of this month. Passengers and crew floated on small boats for over eight hours before being rescued by a British warship. They arrived safely in the country today. The "Arvondale," displacing 9,205 tons, was completed just last year and was well-equipped. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam – According to news received here, the British 9,200-ton ship "North Haven" was sunk by a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean yesterday. All passengers and sailors were rescued by British warships. (Haitong, 16th)</p>
<p>London – Germany has repeatedly issued news claiming that a British 10,000-ton cruiser was sunk off the southwest coast of Scotland. In addition, two British aircraft carriers were sunk one after another, and a destroyer and the battleship HMS Hood were severely damaged and will be out of service for several months. Several cruisers and destroyers were either sunk or damaged during the battle off the coast of Norway last week. British officials have corrected this information, stating that the so-called 10,000-ton cruiser was merely an ordinary patrol vessel, which was damaged but not sunk. The battleship HMS Hood was never hit. Of the aircraft carriers, only the HMS Courageous was sunk; the HMS Ark Royal was hit by water. The naval attaché of the U.S. Embassy in England boarded the HMS Ark Royal a few days after Germany broadcast this news, proving that the claims were completely inaccurate. In short, no British destroyers or cruisers have been hit since the outbreak of the war. Although German aircraft bombed the Norwegian coast for a long time during the battle, none of the bombs hit their targets. (Havas, 15th)</p>

Someone standing in front of his shop picked up a piece a few yards away, still feeling hot. The air raid siren did not sound. There was also a lot of aerial activity in the northern part of Edinburgh. According to eyewitnesses, three fighter planes were seen flying low in the sky. Subsequently, an enemy aircraft flew low towards the city, disappearing behind a hill. Soon after, the sound of machine guns roared, and the aircraft turned northeast. Anti-aircraft shells exploded behind it. As the aircraft circled in the sky towards Pentland Hills, the shells continued to pursue it. According to reports from Edinburgh, three German aircraft were seen flying over the Firth of Forth. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden – Today, Swedish newspapers published the names of the personnel who will accompany the heads of state of the Nordic countries to Stockholm, but the name of a director from the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs was not included, drawing attention here. It is generally believed that Finland's Director Niko Poes, currently staying in Moscow with Paasikivi, will also attend. It is reported that the heads of state of the Nordic countries will arrive here on the 18th and begin the meeting at the Royal Palace on the same day. A grand banquet will be held that evening, inviting all attendees. (Haitong, 16th)</p>
<p>Brussels – Belgian public opinion advocates that Belgium and the Netherlands should act in unison with the four Nordic countries at the Stockholm Conference. Political circles here believe that close cooperation among neutral countries is essential. Belgian newspapers state the historical mission of the Nordic countries, hoping that the Stockholm Conference will take steps to stop the "terrible catastrophe." "L'Indépendance Belge" believes that only the heads of state of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland formally proposing a peace appeal can persuade President Roosevelt to take new steps to mediate the current European war. (Haitong, 16th)</p>

<h3>Finland Temporarily Refrains from Announcing Soviet Demands, Hope Remains for an Agreement</h3>
<p>Helsinki, Finland – The Finnish delegation, led by Minister to Sweden Paasikivi, returned from Moscow on the 14th of this month and is expected to return home tomorrow to submit a report to the government. They are scheduled to return to Moscow on the 17th to continue negotiations. Regarding the nature of the demands made by the Soviet Union, officials here are remaining silent. Political circles say that the fact that Paasikivi was allowed to return home to report suggests that the demands are not of an ultimatum nature, and that there is hope for a friendly resolution of the talks between Finland and the Soviet Union. However, the Finnish government is still taking various security measures for precautionary reasons and continuing to conscript reserves into service. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – The Finnish government and the Finnish Presidential Palace refuse to disclose details of the demands made by the Soviet Union to Finland, but claim that the news published in overseas newspapers regarding these demands is completely untrue. According to information obtained from reliable sources by a Moscow correspondent for a Danish newspaper, the Soviet Union has made four demands on Finland, three of which are: (1) Cession of the islands of Tytärsaari, Lavansaari, and Säiskari in the Gulf of Finland, and control of the island of Sursaari, which controls Kronshtadt Bay, may also be included in the cession. (2) Finland must not fortify the Åland Islands and must allow the Soviet Union the right to inspect the islands. (3) Finland must conclude a military treaty with the Soviet Union. The fourth demand is unknown, but it is believed that this is the reason why the Finnish delegation returned home. The Soviet Union agreed to cede territory in East Karelia to compensate for the cession of the islands in the first demand. It is reported that representatives of the Finnish National Socialist Party recently went to Berlin but returned empty-handed because the delegation was only received by low-level officials who told them that Finland's interests were not within Germany's sphere of influence. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – According to news received here today, Finland will actively participate in the four-nation conference convened by the Nordic countries in Stockholm.

<p>Copenhagen – According to a Helsinki correspondent for a Danish newspaper, Finland is still continuing to prepare for contingencies. All valuables in Helsinki are being moved elsewhere, and shops are also transporting all their inventory to the countryside. It is expected that Finland will soon have an army of 500,000 men. According to rumors in Helsinki, when German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was in Moscow, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov told him that the German residents of Finland must be evacuated completely. It is reported that Ribbentrop has agreed. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

In addition, a certain newspaper reported that the Soviet government intended to sovietize the Baltic Sea coastal countries. Soviet newspapers have firmly denied this. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Zurich, Switzerland – The Neue Zürcher Zeitung recently reported that each Soviet army unit entering Polish territory is a propaganda unit. They carry large amounts of communist propaganda materials to distribute to residents, and propaganda agencies and printing presses have been set up everywhere to spread the ideology in various languages and pictures to residents of cities and towns and villagers in rural areas, house by house. The names of those who refuse to accept portraits of Stalin and other propaganda materials are registered.

<h3>Molotov Receives the Turkish Foreign Minister. The Signing of the Soviet-Turkish Agreement is Postponed Due to New Demands from the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Berlin - The German News Agency released a special dispatch from Moscow stating that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met with Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu at the Kremlin this afternoon. Prior to this meeting, Soviet-Turkish negotiations had resumed. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>London - According to a dispatch from the Istanbul correspondent of the News Chronicle today, the reason for the breakdown of Soviet-Turkish negotiations is that the Soviet Union is demanding that Turkey terminate its mutual assistance agreement with Britain and France. Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu is now awaiting new instructions from the Turkish government. (Associated Press, 16th)</p>
<p>Rome - According to informed sources, the Soviet Union intends to provide guarantees for the Romanian border in exchange for Romania's recognition of Soviet interests in the Balkans. It is also said that in view of the compromise already reached between Turkey and Romania, the two countries may request the Soviet Union to provide full guarantees for the Turkish-Romanian border as compensation for blocking the Dardanelles Strait. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Danzig - According to the Berlin correspondent of the National Daily here, the new demands made by the Soviet Union to Turkey have made the nearly concluded Soviet-Turkish talks in Moscow difficult.

<p>Ankara - Regarding the negotiations between Turkey and the Soviet Union, the cabinet convened a State Council meeting last night to discuss the matter until late at night. Officials are unwilling to express anything about the details of the meeting. The semi-official Ulus newspaper also made no mention of it. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>London - Political figures here have recently commented on the negotiations between Turkey and the Soviet Union, saying that the reports that the two countries would sign an agreement at the end of last week have not materialized, indicating that the current negotiations must have encountered difficulties. Although German sources have reported that the conditions put forward by the Soviet Union have been rejected by Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu and that the negotiations have almost broken down, there is no evidence to prove this. The claim that the Soviet Union is demanding the abolition of the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey is also not necessarily reliable. It is believed that the difficulty in the negotiations lies in the issue of the invasion of Romania or Greece, as Turkey has an obligation to assist these countries. As for the current negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland, according to what is known here, the Soviet Union has indeed demanded several small islands in the Gulf of Finland and has demanded that Finland agree not to build defensive fortifications on the Åland Islands, allowing the Soviet Union to monitor them. At the same time, it also signed military clauses with the Soviet Union. Although all these matters have caused difficulties, there is still a possibility of reaching an understanding.

<h3>The Soviet Red Star Newspaper Comments on the Positions of Britain and France</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Red Star newspaper recently published an article titled "Chamberlain's Warmongering," stating, "Chamberlain and Daladier recently delivered speeches in response to Hitler's proposal to convene a conference of major powers to peacefully resolve the dispute, declaring that Britain and France will continue to fight. The positions of these two prime ministers have completely exposed the true imperialist aims of the Allied forces to the public. Britain and France have rejected Germany's peace proposals and must bear full responsibility for the continuation of the war and the endless disasters that will follow. The rapid development of the situation in recent days has made the working masses increasingly aware of the truth. No matter how hard the Labour Party tries, it cannot conceal the following fact: the purpose of launching and continuing this war is purely to intensify the exploitation of the laboring masses by capitalist aggressors. The anti-war movement is growing in Britain, and various workers' organizations have recently passed numerous resolutions demanding an immediate return to peace." (TASS, 15th)</p>
<h3>The Peace Movement Continues, with the Pope and the King of Belgium Both Expected to Make Statements</h3>
<p>Brussels - King Leopold III of Belgium, at the request of U.S. President Roosevelt, is scheduled to deliver a radio address on the 26th of this month, which will be broadcast across the United States by the New York Broadcasting Station. The 20th Century newspaper here commented on this matter, saying, "The American intellectual community launched an initiative last year, inviting celebrities from around the world to deliver radio addresses. The first person to do so was Mrs. Roosevelt. Now, Leopold III will address international affairs and neutrality, expressing Belgium's views on the issue of neutrality. This move is of great significance in the current situation." (Havas, 16th)</p>

<p>New York - Former British Prime Minister Lloyd George published another article in the New York American today, discussing the issue of war and peace in Europe. He said that if U.S. President Roosevelt could come forward to convene a peace conference, then this conference would definitely succeed. The hesitation of the current belligerent countries to launch large-scale warfare is a great opportunity for mediating peace. If "three courageous countries" cannot avoid large-scale military confrontation, then in addition to the terror of bloodshed and sacrifice, the consequences are unpredictable. (Haitong, 16th)</p>
<h3>Germany Plans to Use Submarines and Aircraft to Attack Britain's Maritime Control</h3>

<h3>Germany Plans to Exchange "Colonial" Rights for Soviet Gold: Reason for the Withdrawal of Germans from the Baltic Coast</h3>
<p>Riga - According to information obtained here, Germany and the Soviet Union have recently agreed on a plan that is very beneficial to the Soviet Union. The main point is that Germany will exchange its "colonial rights" in Europe for Soviet gold. Germany needs gold very urgently, and the Soviet Union will only agree to provide gold after Germany relinquishes its rights in the Baltic Sea region. Hitler was forced to decide to withdraw the Germans from the Baltic states. After all these people have been evacuated, the Soviet Union will have to pay the first batch of gold. The property left behind by these Germans will be received by the government of the country where they are located and paid to Germany in gold, and then the government will pay it to the Germans in Marks, as compensation. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Danzig - The Swedish correspondent of the National Daily here reported that the evacuation of Germans from the Baltic states is the greatest tragedy in German history. They have lost everything without suffering any blows. The evacuating German residents are only allowed to take one bicycle, five Marks, and a day's worth of food. As for all their furniture, it must be sealed up. Money is deposited in the bank, and it is unknown whether it will be returned to its original owner in the future. All German businesses have been placed under local management. German banks have closed. The German newspaper in Riga will cease publication on November 10th. In Riga alone, 35,000 Germans have left the country, and their future is uncertain. They do not know where they will go. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Personnel Changes in the U.S. Navy</h3>
<p>London - According to a dispatch from the New York correspondent of the Daily Mail, after major defects were discovered in the design and construction of some new U.S. ships, major changes have occurred in the U.S. Navy, resulting in the transfer of three admirals and the reassignment of many junior officers. Rear Admiral Bowen, the former head of the Bureau of Engineering, has been transferred to be the head of the Naval Research Laboratory in Bellevue. Rear Admiral Dubois, the head of the Bureau of Construction and Repair, has been transferred to be the director of the new model ship canal in Carderock. His former position will be succeeded by Rear Admiral Kling, the head of the Washington Navy Yard. The correspondent also stated that the stability of two newly built 1,600-ton destroyers is questionable because their weight has exceeded several tons and they lack operational efficiency. In addition, there are ten similar destroyers that could have joined the fleet soon, but currently, urgent changes will need to be made to the construction of each ship.

<h3>U.S. Neutrality Act Amendment Will Be Amended Again to Remove Restrictions on Pacific Navigation</h3>
<p>Washington - According to sources here last night, Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a secret meeting to further amend the Neutrality Act Amendment to remove restrictions on Pacific navigation for American merchant ships. Except for the European war zone, the President will be given the power to designate other prohibited areas so that American merchants can continue to trade with nominal belligerents, such as New Zealand and the South African Federation. The administration believes that this amendment can be passed in the Senate because there are now several senators from Pacific coastal states who are participants in isolationist debates and who all feel this way. It is understood that Majority Leader Barkley will propose to start one hour earlier each day and delay adjournment by several hours. Unless the isolationists can agree to limit the debate, Barkley predicts that the Neutrality Act Amendment will be put to a vote by the end of next week. At the same time, the isolationists are also preparing for a final push. Johnson and Holt will speak tomorrow and Wednesday, respectively. They will attack the government, saying that the government had promised Britain and France that the United States could amend the Neutrality Act if Britain and France fought Hitler.

<h3>A Chinese Aircraft Manufacturing Plant Has Been Established in the Southwest, with 2,500 Technicians and Modern Equipment</h3>
<p>New York - China now has an aircraft manufacturing plant worth US$2 million, employing 2,500 Chinese technicians supervised and trained by 15 American technicians. The plant is located in a remote town in the interior of China with a population of 3,500. All equipment is modern. The plant was designed in 1933, and new products were launched the following year. To avoid Japanese aircraft attacks, the plant has been relocated four times. The current location is named Paulville (named after Paul, the chairman of the Continental Corporation). The place has become a town. The town's base was selected on December 10th last year and resumed production of new aircraft in May of this year. Paul has been involved in the export of aircraft and raw materials for many years. He began his relationship with the Chinese Air Force in 1933. He sold a private aircraft to China and helped China reorganize its air force. Later, he developed a friendship with senior Chinese officials and sold Curtis aircraft worth US$1 million to the Chinese government. Soon, he became China's informal aircraft supplier. The Chinese government and he planned to establish China's first aircraft manufacturing plant. In the summer of 1934, the aircraft factory started manufacturing, but it was bombed within three days of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War and immediately moved to another location. The Chinese government supplied trucks to transport the machinery to Nanjing, and then by ferry to Hankou. Amid constant Japanese air raids, it took five days of arduous work to reach the destination. When the Chinese army withdrew from Hankou, the Chinese government and Paul once again moved the factory, with a total of 181 trucks, traveling more than a thousand miles without any loss along the way. The new factory is located in southwest China, with only a narrow-gauge railroad from French Indochina to reach the location. The location is very hidden, but transportation is extremely inconvenient. So, it was moved again. With the cooperation of all parties and the use of a large number of Chinese workers, the personnel of this Sino-American cooperative aircraft factory, including architects from Myanmar and China, worked hard for a long time to complete this new factory. All equipment is state-of-the-art and comparable to any American factory. There are 3,500 residents in this new factory city, with all modern facilities, including a club for foreigners and 21 villas. The hospital has 81 beds and cost a total of 700,000 yuan. This kind of construction would cost at least 2.5 million yuan in the United States. Paul resides in Hong Kong and has traveled to the interior 27 times in the last eight months, all by plane. However, Paul is currently in New York. (Associated Press, 16th)</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu Has Not Left Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Japanese broadcast on the 9th of this month that Chen Mingshu had left Chongqing for Hong Kong. According to Xie Renzhao, the person in charge of the National Diplomacy Association, the Japanese have spread rumors about Chen Mingshu's actions more than once. This kind of divisive trick is not worth laughing at. Mr. Chen is the chairman of this association, and I am most familiar with his actions. I will not elaborate on other matters. Taking the Wang Lixi Memorial Service on the 8th of this month as an example, Mr. Chen personally attended the meeting and served as the chairman, which proves that the Japanese rumors are futile.

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Issues a Statement: Japan Intends to Subjugate the United States, and the United States Cannot Ignore It</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Today, a reporter asked Dr. Kong Xiangxi, the President of the Executive Yuan of China, whether China has any intention of seeking peace with Japan. Kong replied, "Today's question is not about China seeking peace with Japan, but about whether Japan can abandon its aggression against China. All countries in the world know that China is a peace-loving country. We only know how to fight for national survival and to maintain a peaceful order, until Japan abandons its ambition to conquer and control China, peace can be realized. Furthermore, peace must be based on honor and justice and must be a lasting peace. The peace between China and Japan is not only related to China and Japan but also to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. Furthermore, Japan's aggressive aim is not only to conquer China but also to subjugate the United States. At present, it is certainly a difficult goal to make Japan conquer the United States, but if Japan can control China's manpower and resources, its plan will be greatly expanded. Therefore, the United States cannot ignore the outcome of the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, we cannot help but hope for direct American assistance and spiritual sympathy. However, if the United States wants to restore peace in the Far East and maintain its interests in the Far East, it does not need to resort to force. The United States only needs to adopt an attitude of using force to maintain its interests to achieve its goal. But if the Japanese know that the Americans are not prepared to defend their main interests in the East with force, then Japan will actively carry out its plan to destroy these interests. If Japan's position in the East becomes stronger and more solid, then Japan will attack the United States itself. Fifteen years ago, some people thought it was a joke that Japan would never attack China, but now it is a fact. Today, some people think that Japan will never attack the United States. Who knows if they will fall into a lack of awareness again? The most obvious thing is that if Japan does not want to attack other countries besides China, then why did Japan abolish the Washington Naval Treaty? Why build a powerful navy? It must be known that Japan's military operations against China are mainly based on the army and air force and do not need to use the main force of the navy. Furthermore, if Japan has no ambition towards the United States, then why has Japan established a spy network in the United States, Panama, and other parts of the Americas? And the discovery of these spies is mostly due to the American government. If Japan has no ambition towards the United States, then why do Japan's large fishing fleets gather on the American Pacific coast and enter and exit the Hawaiian Islands? If we search for the motives and answers to these questions one by one, we will have thought about half of them. In short, Japan not only harbors the ambition to dominate the world, but also resents the United States because of the American immigration law that excludes Japanese people, the California legislature that does not allow Japanese people to purchase land, and other treatments that the Japanese regard as humiliating. Your President has advocated resolving the dispute between China and Japan and restoring peace in the Far East through an international conference, which shows that your country's politicians have excellent insights into restoring peace in the Far East. The United States will certainly not sign a new treaty with Japan until Japan expresses its respect for the rights of third countries. But since Japan is trying to subjugate China and eliminate the power of Western countries in China, it is certainly impossible for it to respect the rights of third countries. And Japan's attempt to eliminate Western power in China is not an empty theory but a fact. Recently, Japan has demanded that Britain and France withdraw their troops stationed in China, which is one example. As for Japan's spending all its resources to buy scrap iron from the United States, it is nothing more than wanting to use it to conquer the world. Therefore, China's current resistance is fighting for the world, and it is fighting for the United States, Japan's neighbor across the Pacific. Therefore, my current appeal to the United States is not for American sympathy (because we have fully appreciated and are grateful for American sympathy), but for American cooperation so that this international rogue will not act recklessly."

<h3>Fierce Battles in the Suburbs of Chaozhou City: Chinese Troops Brave Rain to Capture Bijia Mountain; Traitorous Chao'an Rely on Opium and Gambling for a Living</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: For days, the Chinese guerilla forces have been entering and exiting Chenghai City, their footprints reaching deep into Ouding and even outside Shantou City. The Japanese troops have divided their forces to harass Raoping's Lin and Chaoyang's Haimen Shalung, attempting to contain the outer lines of the Chinese army. The Chaoshan Railway and the levee highway have been cut off by the Chinese army in multiple sections, effectively encircling Chao'an City on three sides, preventing Japanese reinforcements from Shantou. Simultaneously, the Chinese army is heavily deployed in areas like Anjie Road, and Sangpu, Yixi, and Zhutong Mountain, with guerillas providing cover for artillery positions on various high grounds outside the city. On the morning of the 3rd, amidst heavy rain, Commander Tan's troops, crossing the Han River upstream, braved the rain to charge and seize the Japanese positions on Bijia Mountain. Upon reaching the mountainside, Japanese artillery on the summit opened fire, but to no effect. A bayonet charge ensued for an hour, culminating in the Chinese troops capturing the Japanese artillery positions and seizing twelve cannons. A post-battle inspection of the mountain revealed over 130 Japanese corpses left behind, with many more wounded escaping. The Japanese suffered approximately 200 casualties in this battle. On the 5th, under clear skies, Chinese aircraft appeared over Chaoshan at 7 AM, dropping bombs on the Yixi area north of the city, preventing Japanese forces from massing. The Chinese ××× Group Army, having reorganized in Fengshun and Jieyang, advanced to the outskirts of the city. Their new artillery accurately fired, engaging in artillery duels with the Japanese artillery on Hulu Mountain. From 8 AM, cannon fire resounded every minute, shaking the mountains. The area outside the city was deserted for dozens of miles, as villagers had received leaflets dropped by aircraft beforehand, warning them of the impending Chinese offensive, and voluntarily evacuated beyond the range of the artillery fire. The artillery battle continued until 10 AM when two Japanese planes arrived, circling the Han River levee multiple times for reconnaissance before dropping four bombs on the mountainous area near Yixi Station. However, the Chinese artillery positions were well-concealed and remained undetected. After the Japanese planes left, the Chinese artillery resumed firing, destroying almost all Japanese positions on Hulu Mountain and Jin Mountain. Two shells hit the Japanese barracks within the Han Mountain Normal School, causing thirty to forty Japanese casualties. The Chinese army did not hold Bijia Mountain after capturing it because the summit was exposed and offered no cover, making it vulnerable to aerial bombardment. The Japanese, on the other hand, would defend it at all costs, aiming to use it as a shield for the eastern part of Chaozhou City.</p>
<p>Due to the Fierce Fighting in Chao'an and Shantou, the Local Puppet Organizations have been Unable to Officially Appear for Three Months Since the End of June; However, Self-Serving Individuals, Frightened by the Cannon Fire, Dare Not Take Office; Individuals such as Chen Juemin, the puppet Hui Chao Jia Garrison Commander, Zhang Weichen, of the puppet Chaozhou Security Maintenance Association, and Zhou Zhizhen of the Shantou Local Security Committee, merely possess a wooden signboard and obtain some expenses from the Japanese army. In reality, they have no influence or function. Zheng Yunxiang, a Taiwanese resident of Chao'an for many years, ostensibly operates a pharmacy but is primarily engaged in smuggling. Recently, he enticed certain youth elements to hold a so-called Revival Assembly. On the 7th, the puppet Revival Association produced a puppet Chao'an Maintenance Committee, selecting Yu Xurunshi, Wu Peiyu, Hong Runbo, Fang Guoxing, and Lu Zhenzhi as puppet committee members. Amidst the cannon fire, they recruited fifty local thugs as puppet police, who are dedicated to collecting fees from gambling dens and brothels. Each evening, the committee members divide the proceeds, each receiving twenty to thirty yuan per day. However, upon hearing of guerilla forces entering the city, they all scatter and flee. After things settle down, they reappear to collect fees. Besides this, they have nothing to do. The puppet self-governance associations in various villages are similar. When twenty to thirty Japanese soldiers arrive in a village, the puppet committee members emerge from the opium dens to express their welcome. Flanking the soldiers with shiny bayonets, they strut around, declaring that the Imperial Army has arrived and demanding that everyone quickly pay the owed household taxes. They also demand that opium dens and gambling houses pay their back taxes and donate twenty yuan each to the Japanese army as a reward. They also ask the heads of various family clans for pigs, chickens, and ducks to buy wine and cook meals for the Japanese soldiers, keeping themselves busy with flattery. Their behavior is extremely despicable.</p>
<p>Japanese in Suzhou Establish a Materials Exchange</p>
<p>Compiling a List of Import and Export Goods</p>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: This county, being the first city on the Beijing-Shanghai line, enjoys smooth water and land transportation and abundant resources. Although it suffered from the Japanese invasion, the losses were lighter compared to other counties. Consequently, the post-invasion cityscape appears bustling. Goods from neighboring counties are imported and exported, and due to transportation reasons, many are transshipped through this county, turning it into a commercial hub for the guerrilla areas south of the Yangtze River. The puppet county magistrate, driven by greed, re-established former checkpoints as merchandise inspection offices, levying heavy taxes. It is said that the monthly revenue is quite substantial, but it has also attracted the attention of the Japanese. They entrusted Lu 　 Bian (former Deputy Consul stationed in Keijo, Korea), a local resident, to establish a "Materials Exchange." The site has been determined to be a certain building on Guanqian Street in the city. It is reported that its business scope is very broad, controlling and monopolizing daily necessities such as rice, tea, silk, cloth, and cigarettes. In the future, the commercial interests of this county will be seized by this exchange, allowing it to raise prices at will. Although various shops have repeatedly requested the Japanese to prohibit this, they have been unsuccessful and can only lament their helplessness.</p>
<p>Furthermore, copper coins and fractional currency in this city were not lacking until two months ago. However, after the Japanese began purchasing them, they are now disappearing. Although the puppet police have repeatedly cracked down on the illegal sale of copper, they have been unable to stop it due to their limited authority. Currently, substitute currency notes are overflowing everywhere. Even very small shops are issuing large amounts of currency notes before the shopkeepers close down and flee. Petty criminals are using the names of old shops to print fake currency notes, creating chaos in the market, which is beyond imagination. It is rumored that the puppet Suzhou People's Bank (established by puppet Shanghai mayor Fu Zongyao and others) is taking advantage of this opportunity to print large numbers of fake fractional currency notes in order to absorb legal tender from the people.</p>
<p>Local Bullies Rampant in Dinghai</p>
<p>Two Teachers Murdered; County Government Sends Troops to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence: Since the fall of this county, local bullies and vagrants have frequently taken the opportunity to rob in the countryside, falsely claiming to be guerrillas and forcibly collecting military supplies, causing great suffering to the people. Recently, some local bullies, again impersonating guerrillas, kidnapped Yu Zefang, the former headmaster of Gan Da Zhao Elementary School from Yixing, and Mei Xin, the former headmaster of Wu Xie Xin Family Temple Elementary School. They were shot dead in a certain village. County Magistrate Su was very saddened and indignant upon hearing the news. He immediately led his subordinates to a certain village to encircle and suppress the bandits, capturing the bandit leader's wife and several bandits. However, the bandit leader himself had disguised himself as a bride, escaped in a sedan chair to another location.</p>

<h3>Recent Developments at the Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute: Plant and Animal Departments Continue Collecting</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The board of directors of the China Education and Culture Foundation and the Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute jointly administer the work of the plant and animal departments. The general situation of the work of the two departments is as follows:</p>
<p>The laboratory research of the institute mostly continues previous work. In terms of collecting, the animal department mainly focused on collecting in Shandong in July and August of the 26th year, collecting more than 5,000 specimens. In the winter of the 26th year, Mr. Jin Shaoji, a member of the committee of the institute, donated more than 20,000 specimens of mollusks, all of which were personally collected by Mr. Jin over the years and are highly valuable. The collecting work of the plant department is still concentrated in Yunnan, and the Royal Horticultural Society of Great Britain and the Arnold Arboretum of the United States have joined in cooperation, responsible for part of the funding. It is estimated that approximately 9,000 plant specimens and 1,500 seed numbers have been collected. The Lushan Forest Botanical Garden collected approximately 900 plant specimens and more than 500 species of seeds from Mount Emei in Sichuan, Mount Huangshan and Jiuhua Mountain in Anhui, and Mount Hengshan in Hunan this year. The papers published by the researchers of the institute in one year are as follows: (1) Zhang Zongbao, "A New Species of Floating Dust in Beiping", (2) Chen Fenghuai, "Research on Chinese Mud Mustard IV", (3) 　 Renchang, "Flora of East Asian Scale Ferns" (4) Hu Xian　, "Notes on Chinese Plants VIII", "A New Genus of Plum Vine from Guowei Yuke", "Notes on Chinese Plants IX", (5) Hu Xian　 Xie Nai, "Paleoflora of Shandong Cenozoic", (6) Hu Xian　, Wang Qiwu, Xia Weikun, "New Distribution of Plants in Southwest China II", (7) Li Liangqing, "Flora of Algae in Anhui, Jiangxi and Hubei", "Notes on Freshwater Algae in Jiangxi", (8) Pan Cinong, "Preliminary Study on Insecticidal Plants", (9) Shou Zhenhuang, "Research on Ostrich Leg Bones", "Miscellaneous Notes on Chinese Birds I to V", "Observation on the Life History of a Marine 　 Retaining Soil Gastropod", "Body Length and Weight of Bell Frogs", "A Small Account of Qingdao Fish", "(10) Shen Jiarui, "Overview of Crabs in North China", (11) Zhang Chunlin, "Research on the Genus", (12) Yang Weiyi, "A New Genus of Anomura", "Research on the Abdominal Segments of Anomura", "The Best Classification Method for Anomura", "Eleven New Species of the Anomura Family", "Evaluation of Three Old Records of Anomura", "New Species of Chinese Anomura", "A New Genus of the 　　 Family", (13) Yu Zhaoqi, "Description of New Harmonies in Tanggu Two-Ended Jump Category", "Several Harmonies of Chinese Freshwater Parasitic 　 Foot Category", (14) Wang Zongqing, "Research on the Nuclear Division of the Tree-of-Heaven".</p>
<h3>Discussion on Cultivating Scout Instructors (Part 1) Yang Kejing</h3>
<p>Detailed Explanation of the Necessity of Cultivating Scout Instructors</p>
<p>(Chongqing Dispatch) Yang Kejing, head of the organization section of the General Association of Boy Scouts of China, wrote an article on the cultivation of Scout instructors due to the extreme lack of Scout instructors in our country. The article offers concrete suggestions on how to cultivate a large number of Scout instructors in the future and is worth considering. The original text is recorded below.</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Education issued an order requiring all junior high schools across the country to implement Scout training, most of the provinces and cities that had not yet organized Scouts have followed the order and set up Scouts. Although there is no clear order from all primary and secondary schools to uniformly implement Cub Scout training, many have voluntarily set up Cub Scouts or Scouts. According to the Ministry of Education's statistics for the 25th year, there are a total of 3,2　 schools in the country, including 36 high schools, 191 senior vocational schools, 814 normal schools, 530 senior vocational mixed schools, 494 senior and junior vocational mixed schools, and 1,390 practical schools. Except for high schools and senior vocational schools, the remaining 3,037 schools should all set up Scouts according to the order. At least one Scout instructor is required per school. If the number of students in a school is too large, it must be increased to two or three. There are a total of 320,080 elementary schools in the country. If all elementary schools were to implement Cub Scouts, at least one instructor would be required per school. With such a large number, even in peacetime, the number of Scout instructors is insufficient. Moreover, during the War of Resistance, many Scout instructors switched to military and political circles. The number who retreated to the rear and continued to work in Scouting is limited, further exacerbating the shortage of Scout instructors. This spring, various primary and secondary schools and children's welfare institutions in Chongqing sent letters to the China Boy Scouts Association and the Chongqing Municipal Council requesting the introduction of Scout instructors, totaling more than ten places, but it was always difficult to find someone to introduce. If this is the case in Chongqing, the situation in the entire province of Sichuan can be imagined. Extending this to the rear provinces, wouldn't it be the same? This is why the cultivation of Scout instructors is so urgently needed.</p>
<p>Scout training is originally a type of education, and no one can deny this. Scout teachers are trained by normal schools, which is also a matter of course. This spring, the General Association of Boy Scouts of China sent a letter to the Ministry of Education ordering all normal colleges and normal schools to increase Scout courses, so that students can serve as primary and secondary school Scout teachers after graduation. One is to open up another path for normal school students, and the other is to add a large number of excellent teachers to the Scouts. The intention is sincere and good. There are a total of six normal colleges and 814 normal schools in the country. At least one-tenth of the graduates each year can serve as full-time primary and secondary school Scout teachers, and all graduates can serve as part-time Scout teachers. After a few years, all primary and secondary schools will have excellent Scout teachers. From this point of view, normal schools are the most suitable institutions for cultivating Scout instructors.</p>
<p>YMCA Prepares to Establish Student Service Society</p>
<p>The student department of the Shanghai YMCA and YWCA, due to the soaring prices of books, stationery, and daily necessities, has initiated the organization of a student service society to reduce the burden on students. It will collect old stationery and daily necessities from students in various schools and display them in the Household Goods Trading Society affiliated with the YWCA for consignment sales. The owners of old items that are no longer suitable can obtain economic income, while buyers can obtain needed items at low prices, which is truly a win-win situation. The society held its first general meeting on September 28th and is currently preparing to officially open on November 1st.</p>
<p>Relief Center for Out-of-School Children Holds Centralized Examination</p>
<p>The ten voluntary elementary schools and one central voluntary experimental elementary school established by the Relief Center for Poor and Out-of-School Children in this city have been fully opened, with a total of approximately one thousand students. The grade system is based on the regulations of the Ministry of Education, shortening the length of study, with the six-year primary school curriculum combined into four years. In order to save expenses, the original-grade complex system is adopted. Because each school has been open for more than a month, in order to examine the performance of the students, a centralized examination will be held starting today. The questions will be set by the center and distributed to the teachers of each school for the students to take. Those who perform well will be awarded prizes by the center to encourage them.</p>
<p>School News</p>
<p>The Correspondence School of Library Science of China The Correspondence School of Library Science of China, located at 486 Nanjing Road, has received many applicants since advertising for enrollment. The school announced that classes would begin on the 16th of this month and, in order to help young people from poor families who have difficulty paying tuition, has set up 20 half-fee places.</p>
<p>Fuhua Supplementary School All classes at Fuhua Supplementary School, located at 270 Yaozhu Road, have started. Due to the large number of students selecting the English class, it has been decided to expand the number of places to meet the demand. Those who wish to study English can still register. In addition, the school's specially established shop staff support class is temporarily offering courses in English, French, Japanese, and commerce. Classes started on the 11th. Group learning is eligible for special treatment.</p>

<h3>West League Football Rescheduled for This Week: Group A Ludo vs. French-Chinese Chamber of Commerce; Saturday Afternoon - 1:30 PM at Yiyuan; Tung Wah Lun Kong to Compete at Six Events</h3>
<p>The 1939-40 West League football season, due to the rain delay last week, is scheduled to begin this week with the simultaneous opening of battles in Groups A, B, C, and Reserve. This week's schedule has a total of eight major battles on Saturday and Sunday, with four in Group A. However, the schedule differs from the one announced yesterday due to the location of the injuries. Within this month, Group A can only play four games per week (originally scheduled for five). The two games between Ludo vs. North-West and Tung Wah vs. French-Chinese Chamber of Commerce were postponed because there is a date specifically for makeup games, so they are not included in the schedule for this week. As a result, Tung Wah has a bye in Group A this week, while Ludo will move up the schedule from next week and instead play French-Chinese Chamber of Commerce at Yiyuan at 2:30 PM on Saturday. There is another Group A game on Saturday, between Portugal and West Fords. Both Group A games on Sunday belong to the West team, while in the Reserve Group, the two strong Chinese teams, Tung Wah and Ludo, will both compete at Jiaozhouyuan. Tung Wah is against Fu, while Ludo is against North-West. The Chinese team with the most games this week is Saturday's Group C Zhendan vs. Peide, and Youyou vs. Hertzberg, and Sunday's Group B Grolink vs. Survey. The schedule for the West League opening week is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Women's Basketball Team Forms to Conquer the Philippines</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Chinese Sports Advancement Association held a special executive committee meeting at the China Restaurant on the 6th floor at 1:15 PM on the 30th to discuss whether to send a women's basketball team to the Philippines to compete. Attendees included Chairman Xie Yuchuan, Li Huitang, Guo Mukai, He Shaoan, Lu Zhiqiang, Chen Zhiqing, Ye Guan　, Zhang Rensheng, and others. Zhong Zhiqiang stated that the organization of a women's basketball team to compete in the Philippines is currently underway. This time is different from when the women's basketball team went to the Philippines in 1933. Last time, it was a trip, but this time, the trip to the Philippines is because local people in the Philippines invited them to compete. The attendees were divided, and it was decided that it could not be done in the name of the Hong Kong Women's Basketball Team. Then Zhong Zhiqiang said that if that name could not be used, could he use a private organization to go to the Philippines to compete. It was then passed. Zhong then introduced Chen Rongtang, Li Chunyu, Yan Xiurong, Deng Yanhao, Lin Shaoping, Chen Huiqing, Huang Maizhen, Wu Ruixin, Nai Shangying, Chen Qizhen, and Ye Muzhen as eleven players to compete in the Philippines. However, the director of the basketball department must prove that they are amateurs, and then the basketball department will submit it to the Joint Association Committee for approval, and then a certificate will be issued.</p>

<h3>Finance   US Dollar Exchange Rate Turns Loose, British Gold Tight; US-British Exchange Rate Returns with Rising Shadow</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. In the gray market, the US-British exchange rate was generally calm and slightly loosened. In the early morning, due to overseas US-British exchange rate fluctuations, it suddenly rose by 1.125, causing the opening situation to be slightly tight at 0.03125 for the British pound, while the US dollar remained unaffected. After the opening, the market was unusually quiet, with very few transactions. Initially, a Japanese firm suddenly began buying, but Chinese merchants simultaneously sold. Moreover, apart from HSBC, foreign banks showed little interest, so the market appeared to harden slightly. However, HSBC seized the opportunity to absorb spot sterling, followed by opportunistic buying, so the market subtly leveled out. By noon, the buying spree had subsided, and the market hardened slightly again. In the afternoon, although there were some small-scale purchases, they had no impact. The market was quiet, and the closing price remained unchanged. In the end, the British pound tightened by 0.015625, while the US dollar rose by 0.03125. The futures situation was identical to the spot market. Trading occurred, with reports that some firms absorbed November US dollars and sold November British pounds at 9.667%. Trading was brisk in the morning but quiet in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Sell, Japanese Firms Buy</p>
<p>In the early morning, there were no cables from London regarding large denomination transactions or Bank of America prices. London spot gold remained unchanged. Exchange rates: British pound versus US dollar, Shanghai dollar, and French franc were all flat. US dollar rose against British pound by 1.125, fell against Shanghai dollar by 0.15, and rose against French franc by 0.5. Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices: British gold at 4/5.53125, US dollar at 7.5, compared to last weekend, British pound was tighter by 0.03125, while the US dollar was unchanged, due to the exchange rate rebounding. After the opening, Chinese merchants showed some willingness to sell, and some foreign banks like Banque Belge pour l'Étranger also showed interest, so the market slightly hardened. It was estimated that Chinese merchants and foreign banks successively sold spot British gold at 4/5.53125 and 5625, and spot US dollar at 7.53125 and 5625 to Japanese firms. HSBC's listed prices were announced as unchanged, and the silver equalization tax also remained unchanged. Subsequently, HSBC suddenly absorbed spot British gold at 4/5.5625 from a certain bank. Simultaneously, a certain firm bought November US dollars at 7.4375 from Chinese merchants. Shortly after, a certain firm suddenly sold November British gold at 4/5 to a peer (the combined November US-British exchange rate was approximately 3.9667). Later, a certain firm suddenly absorbed spot British gold at 4/5.53125 and spot US dollar at 7.5 on behalf of a certain party from a peer, thus the process leveled out. By noon, the buying spree had subsided slightly, and the market trend slightly loosened again. At the noon close, banks' spot selling prices were: British gold at 4/5.546875, US dollar at 7.53125, compared to the morning open, British pound loosened by 0.015625, US dollar hardened by 0.03125.</p>
<p>Afternoon Market Was Extremely Quiet</p>
<p>The afternoon market was even quieter. It was reported that some firms still made small purchases, but prices remained unchanged. At the evening close, banks' spot selling prices were: British gold at 4/5.546875, US dollar at 7.53125. British gold for this month at 4/5.515625, US dollar at 7.46875. British gold for November at 4/5.453125, US dollar at 7.34375. As a result, compared to last weekend, both spot and forward British pounds were slightly tighter by 0.015625, while the US dollars were all slightly looser by 0.03125.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises Six Yuan</p>

<h3>Gold Market Lingers</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold gray market situation: Although foreign exchange rates reported loosening, and negative news such as our army's victories filled the market, ultimately, due to fierce and astonishing buying, the closing price was one yuan higher than the previous day. At the initial opening, exchange bills were slightly looser, priced at 4012 yuan, about 11 yuan lower. Subsequently, the Hong Kong gang started buying, causing the price to rise. However, soon other gangs sold, and overwhelmed by the sellers, the price plummeted to the day's low of 4006 yuan. But the Hong Kong gang refused to show weakness and bought a lot, finally pushing the price up to the day's high of 4028 yuan. The noon close was at 4016 yuan. In the afternoon, a gold firm sold, pushing the price down a few yuan. From then until the close, the Hong Kong gang's buying interest remained strong, no less than in the morning, so the closing price was 4024 yuan. Trading was brisk throughout the day, approximately 1300 taels. Jewelers' ornamental gold remained unchanged. Customs gold, etc., remained stable.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Without Major Fluctuations</p>
<p>Since the early morning, each bar (10 taels) initially opened with reports of firmer foreign exchange rates, and market sentiment was relatively weak. The opening price immediately traded down 11 yuan, with money changers trading 30 taels at 4012 yuan. After the opening, money changers again traded 10 taels at 4010 yuan. At that time, the Hong Kong gang suddenly became active. For a moment, sellers were watching. The price jumped 7 yuan. A certain jeweler bought 30 taels from a peer at 4017 yuan, then raised the price by 3 yuan. Money changers bought 20 taels from a gold firm at 4020 yuan. Subsequently, because money changers, gold firms, and jeweler gangs showed a strong willingness to sell, they supplied endlessly to each other. Although the Hong Kong gang was still buying at that time, it was not as strong as in the beginning. Soon, the price dropped 10 yuan. A jeweler gang sold 10 taels to a gold firm at 4010 yuan. After that, the securities gang came to buy, causing the price to rise by 6 yuan. The securities gang bought 20 taels from a gold firm at 4016 yuan. Then, because a cash gold firm started selling again, and buyers were weak, the price immediately dropped 10 yuan. A cash gold firm sold 20 taels to the securities gang at 4006 yuan. Later, it was reported that foreign exchange rates had rebounded from loose to flat, and buyers gradually increased. Shortly after, the price returned above the 4010 yuan mark. At that time, the Hong Kong gang came to buy vigorously again, more than 500 taels, and then rose again by more than 10 yuan. A certain jeweler bought 20 taels from money changers at 4028 yuan. At noon, the Hong Kong gang stopped buying and watched, and it was reported that foreign exchange rates had slightly firmed again. The price could not sustain and fell back 13 yuan. Money changers traded 10 taels at 4015 yuan, then money changers bought 20 taels from a gold firm at 4016 yuan as the noon closing price. The afternoon opened calmly. Initially, money changers traded 10 taels at 4017 yuan, then a certain gold firm came to sell, pushing the price down 5 yuan. A certain gold firm sold 30 taels to money changers at 4012 yuan. After entering, the Hong Kong gang suddenly commissioned a certain gold firm and a certain jeweler to buy strongly, immediately raising the price by 12 yuan. A certain jeweler bought 30 taels from money changers, and a certain gold firm bought 10 taels from money changers, both at 4024 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, compared to last weekend, the price rose by 1 yuan. The selling price of cash gold firms' own brand gold was 10 yuan higher than smelted gold, and purchases had to be reduced by about 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Remains at Original Price</p>
<p>Jewelers' ornamental gold per tael remained unchanged throughout the day because smelted gold had no major fluctuations. Datonghang still suspended the original price of 405 yuan. New peers are same with higher price, and purchases had to be reduced by about 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities Market Quiet; Jardine Matheson Shares Hit New High</h3>
<p>Securities gray market: Yesterday's market situation, after the sharp rise on Saturday, yesterday's trend still showed a continuous upward momentum. The so-called peaceful atmosphere was just a flash in the pan. There were also rumors of continued issuance of public bonds in the market, so the bond market trended sideways, waiting for new news to help. Throughout yesterday, although the volume of buying and selling was not large, the style remained consistent. Companies such as Tiansheng, Lianhe, and Dafeng consistently bought throughout the morning and afternoon, while companies such as Hongda and Datong consistently sold throughout the morning and afternoon. The rest, such as Hongkang and Maotai, favored buying, while Defu, Lianyi, and Tongyu favored selling. Because there were no large inflows or outflows, the market price trended sideways and was dull. According to the results of the day, most stocks continued to perform well, rising 0.05 to 0.25. However, Class D bonds, because they did not trade on Saturday afternoon, rose by 0.95 alone. The total number of transactions was 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: Shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, because dividends are about to be issued, the market price has been raised to above 9 yuan, but there is a shortage of goods in the market and there have been no transactions. In addition, the Public Industry Association reported that although the stock market only had an hour of trading in the afternoon, it was still exceptionally active. Jardine Matheson shares rose to an unprecedented high of 66 yuan, which is noteworthy. Shares of International Trust Company also rose to 7 yuan. Other stocks had little change. Interest in rubber stocks was also idle. The consumption of American rubber in September was 55,100 tons, maintaining the high level of the previous month. The inventory for the same month was 150,200 tons, a decrease of 11,000 tons. This inventory is now only sufficient for three months of supply, which has fallen to a dangerous level, so it must be replenished quickly to avoid serious situations. The excess of the spot price of raw rubber over the futures price in the New York market is a direct consequence of this situation.</p>
<h3>Swedish Rong Iron Factory</h3>
<p>Regular Shareholders Meeting Convened</p>
<p>Rubber Trust to Pay Dividends</p>
<p>The Rubber Trust Co., Ltd., managed by Huitong Yanghang in this city, has now been resolved by the board of directors to pay the second interim dividend for the one-year period ending September 1939, starting from October 25, at 0.15 per share in national currency. The first dividend was also 0.15, for a total of 0.30 in national currency. The British-owned Swedish Rong Iron Factory Co., Ltd., managed by Anli Yanghang in this city, will convene an extraordinary shareholders meeting on November 10 to discuss the liquidation of the company and to determine the liquidation accountant and liquidator.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Buyers' Enthusiasm Wanes; Cotton Yarn Difficult to Rebound</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still in a stable situation, but the trend is slightly uneven. Market prices rise and fall differently, and the market is still quiet, so transactions are even less. As for general operators, they slightly reveal a feeling of discouragement, and they are very cold to the current concept of going long, so the momentum presents a state of hesitation and uncertainty. From the perspective of the general situation, due to poor digestion, the future may be difficult to rebound.</p>
<p>The opening of the current yarn market in the morning is still a scattered atmosphere as usual. The opening is delayed for a long time, but there are few buyers. The spot price of 20 count Double Horse Foreign Warehouse is 710 yuan, down 9 yuan. Although there are many people calling out on the warehouse receipts, there is a lack of buyers. The opening price is 692 yuan, and after a while, a snatching buying spree suddenly rises, and it returns to 720 yuan. Finally, due to the lack of real demand, it trends downward again. The closing price of 20 count Double Horse is 713 yuan. After checking the transaction in half a day, the statistics are 842 bales. The market price of Double Horse fell 9.5 yuan, Double Earth fell 6.5 yuan, and Tiannv fell 8 yuan, but 20 count Shepherd rose 7 yuan. The factory opened 200 bales of 10 count new Yi yarn from Hongzhang Factory, priced at 565 yuan. The amount of each gang buying is listed below: Peers 085 Hong Kong 205 Mainland 145 Xiamen 72 Jiangxi 115 Ningbo 20 Total 842</p>
<h3>Cotton Factory Demand Reduced; More Than 4,000 Bales of General Cotton Arrive</h3>
<p>The cotton business is still sustainable, but the factory's buying interest is strange. The yarn market is not good, and the sales channels are narrow, so the intention to add raw materials is very weak, so transactions are greatly reduced. As for the peers, in view of the above situation, buying and selling is not as lively as in the past. The daily factory is also dull as always, so the cotton market has nothing to be proud of, but the momentum is stable. The source of cotton from northern Jiangsu is still uninterrupted. In the past two days, another 4,419 bales have arrived. The current cotton sales situation is listed below: Tongzhou 135.00 136.00 Peers 500 bales Changyinsha 134 Peers 200 bales Huoji 130.75 Peers 120 bales Taicang Cotton 139.00 Xinsheng 500 bales Brazil 173.00 Wanchang 20 pieces</p>
<p>Another message: The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is due to the stability of the exchange rate, and there is no improvement in the transaction. All parties are looking forward to it. The factory's intention to buy is very weak, and the peers are temporarily unwilling to sell. Moreover, the arrival of Tongzhou goods in recent days is very crowded, so the trading of foreign cotton is quite quiet.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market was very quiet in the morning? All industries are waiting and watching because of the weekend. The telegrams from Mumbai all reported a fall, and later, due to southern hedging sales and long positions closing, the closing price fell 12 pounds compared to the previous day. India, including the forecast, fell 3 rupees, and Egypt rose 35 pounds.</p>
<h3>Grains: Guest Indica Rice Rebounds; Broken New Japonica Rice Without Changes</h3>
<p>Since the Du Lai market has implemented the rectification of trading rules, there are an unusually large number of customers from various places visiting the market, and the weather is turning cloudy, and people's hearts are towards prosperity, and guests have successively inquired about the local customers yesterday, and at the beginning of the market, the various guest traders shouted up half a yuan to one yuan or so, The Jiangbei Jian opened at 19.1 yuan yesterday, Nanjing No. 1 Nanguan Jian opened at 19 yuan, No. 2 at 19.3 yuan, Zhong at 19 yuan, Wuhu Jian from 19.5 yuan to 18.25 yuan, and Yanglu Jian also improved by two or three corners. The price of Suzhou Kunfeng Jia Yang Jian was 23.2 yuan to 21.5 yuan, and the price of Lu Jian was 23.67 yuan to 22 yuan. The prices of various broken japonica rice were too far apart from the new goods, and there was a lack of special goods, which were all medium grades, so transactions were not smooth and prices did not change. It is estimated that the regular help special break opened at 32 yuan, the city at 30 yuan, and the middle at 28.3 yuan. Wuxi High Break 30 yuan to 27 yuan, Suzhou Tong Help Break 26.5 yuan. As new japonica rice arrived one after another, there was not much fluctuation. The opening price of Changzhou new japonica rice was 28 yuan, Kunshan new japonica rice was 27 yuan to 26 yuan, and Suzhou Tong Help Japonica rice was 26 yuan to 24 yuan. There were not many shipments of Baige rice, and the guests selected good quality, because the quality of the broken goods was soft and easy to change, resulting in different thoughts between buyers and sellers, resulting in a situation of increasing the price of special goods, which rose by more than one yuan. If the special Baige rice of Fengjia opened at 19.2 yuan, the city was 17.4 yuan, and the next was 16.5 yuan. Only one or two hundred bags of Qingjiao kiln species arrived these days, which are also unusually tight, initially shouting 31 yuan, and later actually selling 30.05 yuan and 30 yuan, and also rose by more than one yuan. Change Yuan is average, old is 31 yuan to 30 yuan, and new is 25 to 26 yuan. The total number of goods arriving in the city was more than 4,000 bags, and the number of transactions was 14,000 to 15,000 bags.</p>
<p>The arrival of guest indica rice decreased yesterday. Except for the continuous arrival of stored rice in Wuhu, Nanjing, etc., the production price of indica rice in Jiangbei was not loose, and the medium-grade goods with low prices had to lose money. Therefore, apart from the suspension of business by brokers, they were unwilling to lightly sell new arrivals and previous deposits with the market. Benke took advantage of the low price to absorb, and each of the inland and hoarders took more than 1,000 bags, and the village of Benjie was also quite lively, so the price rebounded by 0.5 yuan to 0.6 or 0.7 yuan. The price of high-quality guest indica rice has reached 20 yuan, regardless of medium-grade.</p>
<h3>Flour Factory Market: Raised to 7.2 Yuan, Wheat Also Follows Up by 0.4 Yuan</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's market has implemented the upgrading of the field, and the buying interest from the north and south foreign gangs and the mainland is commendable, but the factory's willingness to sell is very firm, and the return of goods is even less supplied. It is heard that the new warehouse receipt price of the Red and Blue Car is 7.27 yuan, the price of the warship brand transit goods is 7.13 yuan, and the price of the Phoenix brand in October is also 6.9 yuan, which is 0.2 or 0.3 yuan higher than last week. It is also heard that the foreign powder is out of stock, and the European war peace is disappointing, people's hearts are good, and 1,000 bags of Double Eagle brand have been traded, and the price has risen to 7.8 yuan. The bat brand buyers are not greedy, and there is no proper transaction for the time being. Wheat: Yesterday's market also tended to improve, and the source was not strong. More than 10,000 bags arrived in two days. The powder market has been on the rise for several days, and the raw materials have followed suit. Yesterday, the factory's buying interest was quite strong, and the hoarders' sales were also lively. Fufu and other factories took more than 6,000 bags of goods from Guandian, Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, Luhe, and Anqing, and the hoarders took six cars of wheat from Guandian, Kunshan, and Danyang. The market was about 0.4 yuan higher than last weekend.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Falls First and Then Returns</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of soybean oil fluctuated greatly, with a difference of 1.2 or 1.3 yuan during the day. In the early morning, the general floating hoards were eager to come out of the market, carrying on the exhausted momentum of last week. Kobe oil first fell by 0.6 yuan, and other oils followed suit by 0.4 or 0.5 yuan. After entering the market, the inland Xichang gang suddenly came to drag in, and the market was immediately invigorated. Large households took the opportunity to reverse the trend, and as a result, the market prices of various oils returned to the original prices of last Friday, and Kobe oil rose by 0.6 yuan. The highest price was 66 yuan. A total of 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded in the market (the price is detailed in the market price column), 80 pieces of Yanqi oil, 50 pieces of Qingqi oil, 36 barrels of Kobe oil, 115 barrels of Lian oil, 150 cans of Baijiao canned oil, 700 pieces of peanut oil were traded in this street, and the opening price was 57.5 yuan, which was 0.3 yuan lower than the previous market.</p>

<h3>North-South Goods: Jiangbei Peanuts Offer New Products; The Price Opens at 23 Yuan Per Load</h3>
<p>Jiangbei's new peanuts were transferred from Wuxi to two batches yesterday, one with 78 bags and the other with 90 bags, and they were immediately opened. The price was 23 yuan per market load. According to the Qingdao letter, 120 bags of new peanuts arrived, and they were taken away by the foreign stores, and the price was 16 yuan. The price of raw peanuts was looser, and the price of old goods was reduced by 1 yuan. 58 bags were taken away by the oil mill at that place at 26 yuan. The number of stocks has been scarce. More than 200 bags of new raw peanuts arrived, and they were reduced by 2 yuan. The price of 24 yuan was taken into by foreign stores and Shenbang, etc., and the price was 24 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Peers' Stocks Are Full, Cotton Cloth Transactions Are Light, and Dongpi Is Tired and Cannot Be Revived</h3>
<p>The cloth market has been sluggish due to poor sales to customers, the stocks of peers in this street are full, the hoarders are watching and not moving, and the retail households have little resale, so the transactions are light, and the market price has fallen down and down. The price of white goods, coarse cloth, and coarse twill has fallen by about 0.1 yuan, and the price of fine cloth and fine twill has fallen by 0.1 to 0.25 yuan. The price of some dyed and printed cloth has also continued to fall (per piece) by 0.2 or 0.3 yuan. The price of various flannels that are currently in season is stable due to the shallow stock, but it is not as brisk as before. Customer sales in South Road and abroad are slightly decorated. The Yunnan gang handles 30 or 40 boxes of color cloth, color twill, cheongsam, and strip bleached cloth, the Guangdong gang handles nearly 50 pieces of flannel, color cloth, color twill, and coarse cloth, the Yong gang handles 70 or 80 pieces of color twill, color cloth, and coarse cloth, and the Min gang handles more than 20 boxes of color cloth and color twill.

The Longtou sales opened at 19.25 yuan, and the market atmosphere was sluggish. The reason is that the actual transaction is deserted, and non-industry hoarders are eager to get rid of the goods, which leads to a straight-line decline and fatigue cannot be revived. The price of color goods, Four Gentlemen Serge, opened at 0.65 yuan per yard, and the price of Zhigong was 0.66 yuan, which was also 0.7 or 0.8 cents per yard lower than the peak market price.</p>
<h3>Market Conditions Record</h3>
<p>The foreign currency weakened uniformly yesterday. Although the exchange market and gold prices were not very different, the foreign currency showed a tired trend. The initial US dollar note was as high as 13.523 yuan, and then gradually dropped to 13.4 yuan. In the afternoon, it was suddenly reported that there was a great victory in northern Jiangxi, and most of the colleagues thought it was small, and finally retreated to 13.38 yuan, and the result was a reduction of 0.04 yuan. The British gold pound notes fell 0.5 yuan, and the US dollar also fell 0.5 yuan. The Hong Kong ticket was lower by 0.02 yuan, the French franc ticket was lower by 0.005 yuan, and the Singapore ticket, the Dutch ticket, the Rupee ticket, and the Philippine ticket all fell 0.2 yuan.

<p>Kaiping General Coal Arrives New. Kaiping Anthracite Coal has been obstructed by shipping in the past, and there are few incoming goods, which is only enough for the sales offices to sell, so the door shops have long since disappeared. A few days ago, Yitaixing made various efforts to bring in 3,200 tons of Kaiping general coal, which was transshipped on the Yangjingbang to the upper warehouse, and the estimated price of each ton of screened blocks was 80 yuan, the general cargo was 70 yuan, the No. 1 chips was 74 yuan, and the No. 2 chips was 67 yuan, both in current cash transactions, and the delivery to the customers' homes was to be added separately.

<h3>Problems of Road Construction Beyond the Boundary; The Bureau of Works Appeals to the Diplomatic Body; The Tax-grabbing Intention of the Puppet Side Is Very Obvious, and the Diplomatic Body Will Hold a Meeting to Discuss the Response</h3>
<p>The puppet government in the road construction area beyond the boundary in western Shanghai has repeatedly sent puppet police to occupy the guard posts of the patrol room, and piled sandbags on the sidewalks built by the Bureau of Works and sent puppet police to guard them. Recently, it has tried to seize taxes in the road construction area beyond the boundary. The Bureau of Works is extremely dissatisfied with these illegal acts. It is reported that it has submitted a report to the consular corps, and made an appeal to the consuls general of various countries related to the Public Concession. After consideration, it has been decided to convene a meeting of the consular corps in the near future to discuss the future response policy.</p>
<p>The Puppet Side Covets Millions of Donation Taxes</p>
<p>It is reported that the biggest purpose of the puppet government is to seize the donation taxes in the area. In the first half of this year, the house donation land tax actually collected by the Bureau of Works in the road construction area beyond the boundary totaled 528,642 yuan, and the estimated annual income listed in the budget is 931,000 yuan. This number is almost one million yuan, so the puppet "municipal government" under the wing of the Japanese is thinking of coveting it, because the subsidies of the "Renovation Government" to the puppet municipal government have been stopped.</p>
<p>The Authorities Said That They Would Never Give Up</p>
<p>As for the attitude of the Bureau of Works towards the road construction question beyond the boundary, the roads are purchased and built by the Bureau of Works in accordance with the authority stipulated in the land regulations, so the residents living on both sides of the roads should pay rent and land tax to the Bureau of Works, and the residents living in the alleys beyond the road construction, if they use the public facilities such as ditches, pipes, lights, and tap water built by the Bureau of Works, they must also pay donations and taxes according to regulations. Recently, the puppet "municipal government" has also tried to collect donations and taxes in the area, but the result is unknown.</p>
<p>Interference With Police Power, The Patrol Room Does Not Pay Attention</p>
<p>The Bureau of Works spends a lot of money every year on road construction beyond the boundary, such as hygiene work and fire fighting work. Up to now, the way the puppet "municipal government" interferes is to try to interfere with the patrol room of the Bureau of Works in exercising its duties. Although the puppet "municipal government" had previously promised that it would only exercise its duties outside the road construction road beyond the boundary, it has now clearly violated what it said. The recent development has also expanded the scope, and it is trying to seize the traffic guard posts of the two red and green lights on Yidingpan Road (one is on Daxilu, only one is at the intersection of Yuyuan Road). It sent a final notice to the patrol room, saying that the two red and green lights there would be prohibited from being used from now on, but the patrol room ignored it. This is a new illegal incident in addition to sending donation tickets to the residents.</p>

It is said that the people of the Philippines will give McNutt a grand welcome, as he is a virtuous and capable man whom Osmeña greatly admires. The Philippine government sent him to the United States to pursue certain economic revisions and seek changes in tax rates.

Packard also mentioned the situation in London, saying that there are air raid alerts in London, but no enemy planes have yet arrived.</p>

<h3>Operations Resumed Yesterday</h3>
<p>The various branches of the Bank of Communications that had evacuated from Shanghai resumed operations at their original locations yesterday morning and are handling the temporary joint communications office for the various branches of the Bank of Communications that had evacuated from Shanghai, including the three regions of Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Zhenjiang: (1) The Zhejiang region includes Hangzhou, Wuxing, Jiaxing; (2) The Zhenjiang region includes Zhenjiang, Taixing, Taizhou, Nantong, Rugao, Dongtai, Yancheng, Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Huaicheng, Qingjiangpu, Suqian, Huangqiao, Jiangyan, and Qintong; (3) The Shanghai region includes Changzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, Xuzhou, Danyang, Liyang, Bengbu, Wuhu, Xuancheng, Xinpu, Banpu, etc., totaling more than thirty branches.</p>
<h3>Use Main Entrance</h3>
<p>The temporary joint office of the various evacuated branches of the Bank of Communications opened the main entrance at No. 14 Huangpu Road yesterday morning. Anyone making payments, recieving, or inquiring for the evacuated branches should use the main entrance from now on. The alley entrance on Hankou Road, which was previously used for entry and exit, has been changed to a back door, and the door to the staircase leading to the third and fourth floors has been completely locked. Regarding the recruitment examination for probationary employees, the examination questions and application documents have been moved out and it has been decided to continue processing in the short term. The bank will publish an announcement in the newspaper regarding the location and date. However, the training class for bank employees has been temporarily suspended due to the forced requisition of the location.</p>
<h3>No Leasing</h3>
<p>After the third and fourth floors of the old Bank of Communications headquarters were forcibly requisitioned by the Japanese side for use as dormitories for the personnel of the Japanese military police headquarters, they all used the side door at the street number on Hankou Road for entry and exit, with an elevator directly to the third and fourth floors. However, after negotiations with the police, the Japanese side still occupies the site and has not withdrawn. As for rumors that the matter will be submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council for discussion, the reporter met with a certain Chinese director yesterday and learned that the matter has not been proposed on the agenda for the next board meeting, so the rumor about the discussion cannot be confirmed. As for the leasing news reported yesterday regarding the Bank of Communications, according to investigations, it is not true.</p>
<h3>Local Groups Launch "Respecting Integrity and Shame" Campaign Promote Moral Values and Uphold National Righteousness; Immediate Discussion of Campaign Advancement Measures</h3>
<p>In view of the recent decline in moral values and the loss of integrity and shame, even among those with status and prestige in society, who disregard shame and are obsessed with power and serve the enemy, at this time of serious national crisis, leading figures from local industrial, commercial, educational, and charitable organizations, such as Yan Shengsan, Wang Zhicheng, Ye Fengdi, and Zhu Chengfu, could not bear to stand idly by.</p>
<h3>Unwilling to Stand Idly By</h3>
<p>The spread of this trend will affect the war of resistance and shake the foundations of the country. Therefore, at 4:00 p.m. yesterday (the 16th), they held a dinner party at the YMCA in Baixianqiao to launch a "Respecting Integrity and Shame" campaign. More than 130 people attended. Luo Ziqiang was elected as chairman to report on the significance of launching the integrity and shame campaign and stated that this campaign is purely motivated by</p>
<h3>Patriotic Zeal</h3>
<p>and has no background whatsoever. In addition to encouraging everyone present to set an example for society, we should also mobilize in schools, agencies, organizations, neighborhoods, factories, shops, and even households to organize (1) to pledge not to participate in shameless undertakings and not to accept shameless money; (2) to jointly condemn and criticize shameless people without showing any leniency, so that the atmosphere can be changed, and</p>
<h3>National Righteousness</h3>
<p>can stand tall in the world. After the speech, there was thunderous applause. Subsequently, the participants discussed ways to promote the integrity and shame campaign and resolved: (1) to establish the Shanghai Citizens' Integrity and Shame Campaign Committee; (2) to elect Luo Ziqiang, Yan Shengsan, Wang Zhicheng, Wang Daonan, Ye Fengdi, Zhu Chengfu, Huang Yuanhao, Zhang Qianli, Zhang Haishan, He Jiabao, Wang Gengyang, and one other person as committee members; (3) the</p>
<h3>Campaign Rules</h3>
<p>and the location of the committee's office will be determined by the committee; (4) to invite Mr. Lin Kanghou, Chu Qiaqing, Yuan Lidun, Xi Yushu, Jiang Yiping, Xu Jiqing, Huang Hanzhi, and Kui Yanfang to serve as consultants and to lead the citizens to vigorously promote the campaign; (5) to issue official statements. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Repayment of Principal and Interest on National Defense Bonds and Gold Bonds</h3>
<p>After the National Defense Bonds of the 27th Year of the Republic of China (1938) and the Gold Bonds of the 27th Year of the Republic of China (1938) were issued at face value on May 1 of last year, the Ministry of Finance sent letters to various agencies and organizations to encourage people across the country and overseas Chinese to subscribe. Subscriptions were very enthusiastic. October 31 of this year is the first date for repayment of principal and payment of interest on these two bonds. The ministry has already allocated funds from the designated fund and handed them over to the National Debt Fund Management Committee of the Central Bank. The accounts for these two bonds are specifically stored for payment. The Central Bank and its authorized banks will begin making payments at the end of this month. Subscription methods: (1) The National Defense Bonds were issued for 500 million yuan in national currency and subscribed at face value; (2) The Gold Bonds were issued for 100 million Customs Gold Units, 10 million pounds sterling, and 50 million U.S. dollars. Those who paid with Customs Gold Notes would be issued Customs Gold Bonds; those who paid with raw gold and its manufactured products or gold coins would be converted into Customs Gold Units based on the pure gold content, with each Customs Gold Unit equivalent to 6.1866 milligrams of pure gold; those who paid with foreign currency or foreign exchange would be issued Sterling Bonds if they paid with pounds sterling, and U.S. Dollar Bonds if they paid with U.S. dollars. The same applies to those who paid with foreign securities at the selling price at the time. Those who paid with foreign currencies, foreign exchange, or foreign securities other than Customs Gold, pounds sterling, or U.S. dollars could choose to convert them into Customs Gold, pounds sterling, or U.S. dollars at the market price at the time, according to their preference, and would be issued bonds of the chosen type(s).</p>
<h3>Sanmin Youth League Sends Telegram to Chiang Kai-shek to Congratulate Victory</h3>
<p>With the decisive battle between the Chinese and Japanese armies outside Changsha, and with the Chinese army repeatedly capturing important towns in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces within a period of ten days, local civil groups sent telegrams to Chongqing and the front-line soldiers to congratulate the victory and express their condolences. The members of the Sanmin Youth League are spread throughout the provinces. It is now known that the General Headquarters of the Military Celebrations received a telegram from the Shanghai Branch of the League to General Chiang Kai-shek, forwarding condolences to the commanders of various war zones and all the soldiers, which stated, in brief: "With the repeated capture of important towns in Hunan and Jiangxi and the joyous news being reported, the people are delighted and encouraged, and we send our condolences and express our respects."</p>
<h3>"New Taikoo Maru" Sinks Outside Xingang Violated Regulations by Carrying Too Many Passengers and Cargo; Hull Ruptured, Leading to Sudden Accident</h3>
<p>More Than Four Hundred Passengers, Only Over One Hundred Rescued</p>
<p>Since March of this year, foreign merchant ships sailing the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, passing through the ports of Tongzhou, Chongming, Qidong, Haimen, and Jingjiang, have frequently encountered obstruction by the Japanese navy, resulting in a sharp decline in business and many closures. Initially, there were thirty to forty ships operating on the above-mentioned routes, but now there are fewer than ten, including *Jiangding*, *Luan*, *Luokang*, *Keisden*, and *Lisha*. Shipping to ports under the jurisdiction of Jingjiang County (i.e., Longwokou) is completely dominated by Japanese merchants. Foreign merchant ships are not allowed to operate. To operate a port, it is necessary to have a Japanese merchant background and fly the Japanese flag. Currently, the North and South Ocean Lines and Yangtze River Lines owned by the Japanese Nisshin Kisen Kaisha have been merged into the East Asia Shipping Company. However, the small steamers operating on the Chongming Line are still managed by Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, including *New Taikoo Maru* and *Dahua Maru*, which operate on the port line, and *Zhejiang Maru* and *Qingning Maru*, which operate on the Chongming line.</p>
<h3>Departure Yesterday Morning, Sank at Noon</h3>
<p>The *New Taikoo Maru* has a displacement of 108 tons and a hull length of 118 feet. Yesterday morning, at Pier 2 on the Bund, it loaded a full cargo of goods and more than 400 passengers, departing for ports such as Kou’an and Xingang. Unexpectedly, 11 nautical miles from the mouth of the Wusong River, at 12:45 p.m., the ship sank due to being overloaded and having more passengers than the allowed number of 150 (the company admitted to over 200). The hull ruptured and sank. When the accident occurred,</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson Iron Barge Encountered and Rescued</h3>
<p>The Jardine Matheson Company's *Hanhe* (an iron barge) happened to be returning to Shanghai from Beishahu, carrying cotton. Seeing the *New Taikoo Maru* sinking, it immediately sailed to the side of the ship to rescue and sent a telegram to Shanghai. Nisshin Kisen Kaisha received the telegram and immediately dispatched the small steamer *Qingshan Maru*, which rushed to the rescue at around 2:00 p.m. yesterday. A nearby Japanese destroyer also arrived at the scene to assist in the rescue.</p>
<h3>Cause of Accident Worthy of Attention</h3>
<p>It is said that the *Hanhe* rescued more than 60 people. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 4:30 p.m. yesterday, but due to the above-mentioned circumstances, it was delayed until around 6:00 p.m. It was expected to arrive last night. The cause of the accident was entirely due to excessive cargo and too many passengers, resulting in this unfortunate incident. The Japanese destroyer that helped with the rescue also rescued 49 passengers and entered the port at around 7:00 p.m. last night, sailing directly to the South Huangpu. It is said that injured passengers were sent to the hospital by the ship for treatment.</p>
<h3>Sudden Change in Climate Northern China's Atmospheric Pressure Rises Hurricane Sweeps Over Shanghai's Eastern Waters; High Tides Continue, Water Level Has Not Receded</h3>
<p>The weather in this city has changed dramatically due to the influence of a small high-pressure system in northern China. The temperature has dropped, the wind has picked up, and rain has been intermittent. The highest temperature at 10:00 a.m. yesterday dropped to 71.1 degrees, compared to 75 degrees at 10:00 a.m. the day before.</p>
<h3>Severe Hurricane Advances Rapidly Northward</h3>
<p>According to the Observatory, another hurricane has formed in the Pacific Ocean, and the wind force is quite strong. At 6:00 a.m. yesterday, it had advanced to 27 degrees north latitude and 127 degrees east longitude, with the center of the wind force within 60 nautical miles, advancing rapidly in a north-northeast direction. According to the reported position, the hurricane has moved near the Ryukyu Islands. At 5:00 p.m. yesterday afternoon, the Observatory continued to report that the hurricane had advanced to 29 degrees north latitude and 128 degrees east longitude, with the center within 60 nautical miles, still moving in a north-northeast direction. According to the reported position, the hurricane has reached southwest of Kyushu Island in Japan and will pass approximately 400 nautical miles east of Shanghai. As a result, the climate in this city is also disturbed by it, with strong winds and heavy rain throughout the day. When the wind picked up, there were a total of five wind forces.</p>
<h3>Sudden Climate Change; High Tides Continue</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:20 p.m., dark clouds gathered, the sky darkened, forming a dim state, lasting for several minutes before it cleared slightly. Also, before 3:00 p.m. yesterday afternoon, the highest temperature was only 72.1 degrees, while the highest temperature at the same time the day before was 82.4 degrees, a sudden drop of more than ten degrees. The difference between the hot and cold weather in one day can be said to be significant. The Huangpu River still had a high tide at 2:10 p.m. yesterday, measuring more than 11 feet. As a result, the low-lying streets and sewers were inundated with water, such as Nanjing Road, Zhejiang Road, Guangxi Road, Guizhou Road, Gansu Road, Avenue Foch, Avenue Joffre, Avenue Haig, and Avenue du Roi Albert, etc.</p>
<h3>In the Cold Wind and Bitter Rain Puppets Perform Dramatically The Parade Was Blocked Midway and Departed Sadly; Very Few Guests Attended the Puppet Government's Reception</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the establishment of the puppet "Municipal Government." To make a grand show of it, the various puppet organizations decorated their doors in a big way yesterday. However, the weather was unfavorable, with heavy wind and rain for several days. The color arches built in front of the puppet municipal government were blown down by the strong wind. It was originally planned to build an arch under the Baidu Bridge, but it was prevented by the Shanghai Municipal Council. The conical arch at the intersection of Qijiang Road and North Sichuan Road also lost its color after being blown by the cold wind and bitter rain. The red cloths with congratulatory words written on them, which were tied on the piers of Baidu Bridge and Sichuan Road Bridge, were torn by the strong wind. From 12:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. yesterday, the puppet municipal police局 used the Guangdong Grand Theater before "August 13th," now renamed the Fumin Grand Theater, as the venue for a recreational event. There were six puppet police officers standing in front of the theater. The programs performed, in addition to martial arts, were mostly outdated old dramas, and there were very few spectators.</p>
<h3>Parade Blocked</h3>
<p>At 3:00 p.m., the puppet side sent more than 20 trucks, each carrying two or three people wearing short jackets and untidy suits. White bamboo cloth banners with congratulatory words were hung on the sides of the trucks. The people in the trucks all held small five-color flags, Taijitu flags, and colorful triangular flags. They arrived at North Sichuan Road, intending to pass through Sichuan Road Bridge and drive towards western Shanghai. When the trucks reached the top of Sichuan Road Bridge, they were stopped by the guards at the southern pier and prohibited from passing. One side reported to the military authorities stationed there. After consultation between the two sides, the British troops believed that if the slogans and flags on the trucks could be completely removed, they would be allowed to pass. After a standoff until 3:20 p.m., the puppet side complied, collected the slogans and flags, and was allowed to slowly drive across Sichuan Road Bridge, two trucks at a time. A total of six trucks were allowed to pass in three batches.</p>
<h3>Pathetic Situation</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, less than a hundred steps after crossing the bridge, these six trucks raised the slogans and flags and shouted slogans. The police believed that this would disrupt public order and detained the last two trucks, escorting them away. At this time, traffic was also cut off, but single pedestrians could still pass. The trucks that stopped on the bridge had now driven to the southern pier and were also stopped by the police. One side immediately called the police, and at 3:30 p.m., two red police vehicles arrived, facing the trucks parked at the southern pier from a distance, and the situation suddenly became tense. Seeing the police vehicles arriving, the people on the trucks were unwilling to be outdone and raised a large five-color flag of more than ten feet. The strong wind and heavy rain made the flag even more colorless, and the ignorant workers on the trucks had nowhere to hide. The situation was quite pathetic. At the same time, two trucks of fully armed British soldiers arrived at the entrance of the British Navy Youth Club at No. 630 Sichuan Road, carrying guns and ammunition, stationed inside to prevent the situation from escalating.</p>
<h3>Departs Sadly</h3>
<p>According to people coming from the northern pier, there were still fifteen trucks parked on that side, and several trucks of armed Japanese soldiers also arrived, making the situation even more tense. At this time, a Japanese officer came from the north side of the bridge, walked to the front of the two red police vehicles, looked around, and peered into the vehicles. The police did not stop him. In this situation, after a standoff for two hours, the red police vehicles finally left at 5:50 p.m. After a while, the trucks parked at the southern pier also lowered their flags and drums, decided to drive over, and drove around Suzhou Road. Traffic was also restored.</p>
<h3>End Hastily</h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, the puppet "Municipal Government" held an anniversary of its establishment in the "City Center" Building. The puppet "Mayor" was scheduled to host 1,500 guests, but very few people accepted the invitation. Westerners who attended included Frankling, Chairman of the Municipal Council; Philip, Director-General and Director of the Municipal Council; Jobert, Chief of the French Concession Police; Bowen, Chief of the Municipal Council Police; Jones, a famous lawyer; and Fischer, the German Consul-General. No British or American consuls attended. There were many flags hung there. When 10:00 a.m. arrived, after the transmission of the speech, other puppet members and Japanese naval and army officers gave speeches in succession. After entering, they inspected eight teams of puppet police, took photos, and dispersed. In addition to the banquet, each participating "guest" was given a specially made flower bouquet and a silver badge tied with a silk ribbon or tassel. The puppet police stationed along the way were not carrying guns. "Matsui Road," the main road leading to the "City Center," had puppet police stationed, who were polite, but each guest's car had to be checked before being allowed to pass. Finally, according to foreign sources, the puppet side spent as much as 400,000 yuan on this "celebration."</p>
<h3>Still Not Acting on Behalf of Soviet Affairs Awaiting Moscow Telegram</h3>
<p>Regarding the Soviet consulates in the four occupied areas of Shanghai, Tianjin, Beiping, and Zhangjiakou, which have been ordered to close, the affairs they left behind have been entrusted to the Norwegian consulates in the above-mentioned areas to handle. The reporter inquired with diplomatic circles again yesterday morning and learned that the Norwegian consulates have not yet been able to handle the affairs they are acting on behalf of, such as consular visas and issuing passports. It is heard that the Soviet consulate in Shanghai has telegraphed the Soviet consulate in Harbin to inquire. According to a reply telegram from the Harbin side, it is still necessary to request instructions from Moscow. However, diplomatic circles believe that the question of when the Norwegian consulates will take over on behalf of the Soviet consulates is not important. What is important is the fact that the Soviet authorities have taken this measure. Therefore, it is generally believed that Soviet-Japanese relations may not be able to ease as a result of the recent signing of a ceasefire agreement.</p>
<h3>Shooting in a Brothel Japan Plans to Protest Claiming Shooters Were Guerrillas</h3>
<p>According to *The China Press*, it was reported by the Japanese side last night (the 15th) that the Japanese consulate authorities plan to protest to the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department regarding the shooting in a brothel on Saturday night that injured two Japanese people. According to Japanese sources, the Japanese consulate officials have completed the investigation of this crime and plan to accuse the Police Department in their protest of "still failing to effectively curb the activities of Chongqing elements." It is reported that the shooting occurred at a brothel at No. 26 Pingwang Road. According to the police report, several Chinese and Japanese people were drinking and having fun in the brothel at the time. Suddenly, a Chinese person entered and opened fire. Li Dingshi, the "Director of the Public Works Bureau of the Special City Government," escaped unharmed. Two Japanese "advisors" to the "City Government" were each shot and wounded. A Chinese director of a Chinese-Japanese joint venture automobile company jumped out of the second-floor window and was injured. One prostitute was killed and one was injured. Those injured include Kitasho Ketsu, 40 years old, who was shot in the abdomen from the left side; Ikeda Ketsuro, 41 years old, who was hit in the face with a gun butt; and Dong Ming, director of the Huazhong Urban Automobile Co., Ltd., who jumped from the building and injured his buttocks and left leg. Another Japanese advisor, Sasaki, Wang Changchun, a "Councillor of the City Government," and Li Dingshi, "Director of the Public Works Bureau," were unharmed. According to the witnesses, three or four assassins rushed into the room where the banquet was being held, shouting that they were guerrillas, and then fired eight shots. When the bullets jammed and could not be fired, they hit Ikeda in the face with the gun butt. After Kitasho was injured, he was taken to Fumin Hospital, and the bullet in his abdomen was removed by surgery on Saturday night and he is expected to recover in two months.</p>
<h3>American Government and Public Opinion Concerned About Far Eastern Events. Whether the Treaty Between the US and Far Eastern Nations is Renewed Largely Depends on the Outcome of the War in China. Remarks by the US High Commissioner to the Philippines Before Departing from Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Sayre, the newly appointed US High Commissioner to the Philippines, accompanied by his wife and two children, arrived in Shanghai on the President Coolidge of the Dollar Steamship Lines at 2:00 PM on the 15th. Mr. Gauss, the Consul General of this port, Admiral Hord, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, and over 300 others, held a welcoming reception for Mr. Sayre at the Shanghai Race Club, located at Xieqiao on Jing'an Temple Road, at 6:00 PM that evening. As Mr. Sayre was about to take office, he did not wish to linger and hastily departed from Shanghai with his family on the original ship at 10:00 AM yesterday morning, heading to the Philippines to assume his new post via Hong Kong. During his voyage, Mr. Sayre briefly spoke to reporters about the general situation in the United States. The following is the transcript of his remarks:</p>
<p>The United States Hopes to Maintain Neutrality</p>
<p>Civilization depends on trade. Past great cultures have died because their commerce was suppressed. Trade between the United States and the Far East only has beneficial effects for those involved. When asked about the US's attitude towards the current situation in Europe, Mr. Sayre replied that the American people hope to maintain neutrality but are deeply concerned about preserving democracy. The American people do not want international chaos and rule the world with force. Whether the United States can remain neutral in the war is still unknown.</p>
<p>Many US-Japan Treaties are Outdated</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the abrogation of the US-Japan commercial treaty, Mr. Sayre gave a brief reply, stating that many of the old clauses could not protect US interests. As the abrogation of the treaty would take a considerable amount of time, the Japanese government was notified that the United States had decided to replace the outdated clauses to make them suitable for modern use to adjust international trade and interests.</p>
<p>Equal Treatment for All Treaty Nations</p>
<p>About a year ago, the United States concluded excellent commercial treaties with Britain and France, as well as with Switzerland, Norway, and various Latin American countries. These commercial treaties are based on the principle of equal trade treatment and stipulate opposition to discriminatory trade barriers. This new system has already shown its results, namely increased trade and the protection of US exports to various countries. The most sincere approach is being taken to protect US interests and commercial treaties that benefit other countries, and every effort is being made to advance this.</p>
<p>Far East Shipping Should Be Maintained</p>
<p>When asked about the restrictions on American shipping stipulated in the Pittman Neutrality Act amendment currently under discussion in the Senate, Mr. Sayre declined to discuss the matter, except to say that he hoped that American shipping in the Far East could be maintained and not hindered. However, he expressed his firm view that the general trade of the United States needs to be maintained. On this point, Mr. Sayre pointed out that world civilization depends on trade, and he cited major trading nations that have been dominant in the past and present due to trade, and reviewed the decline of powerful nations due to the loss of their trade. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain trade between the United States and the Far East.</p>
<p>Far East Events</p>
<p>Of Utmost Concern</p>
<p>When asked whether Senator King's proposed amendment to the Pittman Bill would gain the approval of the Senate, Mr. Sayre did not comment on this. If Senator King's amendment is passed, it will repeal the proposed restrictions on American shipping to the Far East. Mr. Sayre continued to comment on the events in the Far East, stating that the American people are deeply concerned about China, and even with the outbreak of the European war, this concern has not diminished. Whether the commercial treaty between the United States and Far Eastern countries is renewed depends largely on the outcome of the war in China. If the war in China is not resolved, there will be no detailed discussion of the commercial treaty.</p>
<p>No Criticism of Philippine Issues</p>
<p>When asked about his views on Philippine affairs and the possibility of the United States continuing to hold sovereignty over the Philippines after the current independence bill is amended, Mr. Sayre did not give a definite answer but acknowledged that this issue is currently under study. He cannot make any comments at this time. When he does make a definite statement on Philippine affairs, it will be in Manila, not Shanghai. Among the many issues he will be paying attention to, one is the re-examination of the issue of Philippine independence. At this time, he has no specific plan to study this issue. He also declined to comment on reports that the Philippines hopes to gain independence while maintaining economic priority, like Cuba.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Sayre's Short Stay in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to reports, those who welcomed Mr. Sayre upon his arrival in Shanghai yesterday included Admiral Hord, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, and Mr. Gauss, the US Consul General. After meeting with reporters, Mr. Sayre boarded Admiral Hord's barge to go ashore, and then toured the city with his wife. Mr. Gauss then hosted a banquet for Mr. and Mrs. Sayre at the Columbia Country Club. The reception was informal, and American expatriates in the city were invited to attend. About 300 people attended. Mr. Sayre was formerly the Assistant Secretary of State. He decided to bring his wife and two children to the Far East. Those traveling with him also included his legal advisor, Mr. and Mrs. Pell, administrative assistant, Mr. and Mrs. Wheelock, and private secretary, Miss Gray, and Miss Newcomb.</p>

<h3>College Students Commit Crimes; Extorting Classmates Leads to Arrest; Confession of Gang Membership and Intimidation Results in Court Order for Detention</h3>
<p>Guo Jiarong (21 years old), Chao Weizu (19 years old), both from Changzhou, and Lu Xiaofeng (19 years old), a local, and Yan Wenkuai (19 years old), from Ningbo, all students at a certain university, frequently frequented dance halls, causing the money provided by their parents to be insufficient for their expenses. Guo Jiarong, together with Zhu Zhaogen, a local student currently studying at the Kader Road Chinese Vocational School, had</p>
<p>Previously Been Classmates</p>
<p>Zhu came from a well-to-do family. Therefore, Guo Jiarong colluded with Lu Xiaofeng, Chao Weizu, Yan Wenkuai, and others to summon Zhu Zhaogen from his home at 77 Pan Sheng Road in the French Concession on the 12th of this month. While strolling and chatting on the road, Guo Jiarong claimed that a former classmate named Zhang Yong had been arrested by the Japanese for participating in guerrilla activities. Lu Xiaofeng spoke in Japanese and dressed like a Japanese person. Yan Wenkuai</p>
<p>Played the Role of Translator</p>
<p>claiming that the Japanese person (referring to Lu Xiaofeng) worked for the Japanese army. According to the claim, after Zhang Yong was arrested, his confession implicated Zhu Zhaogen as an accomplice. The Japanese were now also seeking to arrest Zhu Zhaogen. At the time, Guo Jiarong expressed shock and asked Zhu Zhaogen how he would deal with it. Zhu also felt deeply uneasy. Yan Wenkuai and others then said that they should ask this Japanese friend (referring to Lu Xiaofeng) for help to prevent the matter from escalating. Lu Xiaofeng continued to express his opinion in Japanese. Guo Jiarong and others said to Zhu Zhaogen,</p>
<p>This Matter is Not Small</p>
<p>At least 500 yuan is needed to settle the matter. Zhu begged bitterly at the time, and it was eventually decided that 320 yuan would settle the case. However, Zhu did not have such a large sum of money at the time and only gave Guo Jiarong and others 30 yuan. The rest was agreed to be paid in full on the evening of the 15th of this month. Guo Jiarong and others took the 30 yuan and spent 10 yuan on a meal, leaving 20 yuan to be divided, with each receiving 5 yuan. After Zhu Zhaogen made the payment, he reported it to his parents,</p>
<p>Who Then Realized He Had Been Deceived</p>
<p>They reported the information to the French Concession Police Station and requested an investigation. Upon receiving the report, the French police dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to wait at the agreed-upon time for the remaining payment to be made. As expected, Guo Jiarong and the other three arrived on time to collect the money and were arrested together by the detectives and taken to the police station. Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, Detective Xu Jinlong and others escorted them to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, requesting detention for investigation. Judge Zhang Minsheng</p>
<p>Took the Stand for Interrogation</p>
<p>The defendant Guo Jiarong confessed that on the 12th of this month, his classmate Yan Wenkuai came to borrow money. The defendant did not have any money at the time. Later, they went to visit their classmate Zhu Zhaogen together. It happened that a friend, Lu Xiaofeng, looked like a Japanese person, and did not know Zhu Zhaogen. Moreover, they knew that Zhang Yong was Zhu's good friend and had been arrested. Therefore, the defendants temporarily came up with the idea of borrowing money from their classmate Zhu Zhaogen.</p>
<p>It Was Not Premeditated</p>
<p>Lu Xiaofeng confessed, "I only said a few words in Japanese, I didn't take care of other work." Yan Wenkuai, Chao Weizu, and others also confessed to participating in extortion and fraud. The court briefly questioned the plaintiff, and then ordered that the defendants be detained, and rescheduled the hearing for October 25th.</p>
<p>Garden Owner Kidnapped</p>
<p>Ransom Demanded</p>
<p>Chen A'dong, a local resident of Chenjiazhai on Baisezhong Road, Haig Road, in the French Concession, went to plant trees in the garden of Linjia Lane on Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai around 8:00 AM on September 28th. He was suddenly kidnapped by more than ten bandits and has been held for half a month.</p>
<h3>Bizarre Murder Occurs in Hongqiao Town, Western Shanghai; Female Homeowner Shot and Killed After Midnight Knock; Perpetrator Flees; Motive for Assassination Unknown</h3>
<p>Wang Jiying, a 30-year-old local woman from Xinqiao Village, the westernmost part of Hongqiao Town, western Shanghai, had never married and lived with a 10-year-old adopted daughter and her father, Mr. Wang, in Shanghai. Her father ran a carriage business, which was doing well. After August 13th, Mr. Wang became ill and disabled. Jiying took over her father's business, but she was naturally romantic and not good at managing it, leading to its decline and eventual closure. A few months ago, feeling that it was difficult to live in Shanghai, she thought that life in the countryside would be easier to maintain. She immediately moved back to her old home in Hongqiao. Suspicious figures often entered and exited her door. At midnight the day before yesterday, a very urgent knock was suddenly heard. Jiying immediately ordered her adopted daughter, who was lying in the next room, to open the door. She saw a stranger who seemed familiar. The man told the girl to go back to her room. Then,</p>
<p>He Arrived at Jiying's Bedroom</p>
<p>The girl heard the two talking in very low voices in the next room, which were not very clear. She only felt a murmuring sound. About an hour later, the two seemed to walk out of the bedroom. Suddenly, a loud bang was heard. The girl rushed to see Jiying lying in a pool of blood, unconscious and barely breathing. The man was already gone. Neighbors rushed over upon hearing the news and placed her on the bed. She had already died. They saw that she was only wearing a cheongsam, and her lower garments were missing. They felt surprised. Why was she assassinated? It was difficult to understand at the time. There was no news. The family of Chen is extremely worried and concerned. However, due to the remote environment, there is no way to rescue him. Suddenly, yesterday, they received a letter from the bandits, claiming that the hostage is currently ill, but not seriously. They are being treated by a doctor. They also said that if 200,000 yuan can be used for ransom, the hostage will be safely returned, etc. According to Chen's neighbors, Chen has four brothers, all of whom are engaged in gardening. They are usually hardworking, simple, and frugal, so they have some savings. However, Chen only received a quarter of it.</p>
<h3>Fake Diamond Ring Discovered; Owner Hu Shanqing Arrested; Confession Indicates Exchange by Pawnshop</h3>
<p>Hu Shanqing (34 years old), a native of Ningbo who worked as a chief steward on French warships, currently resides at No. 2 Hongyuli, Zhengjia Muqiao Street. On the first of this month, due to urgent need, he took a diamond ring that he had purchased in Saigon, French Indochina, to Hengde Pawnshop at No. 277 Aidoa Road for</p>
<p>Pawning</p>
<p>He received 500 yuan in national currency. Afterwards, the store discovered that the diamond ring was fake, but there was nothing they could do. The day before yesterday afternoon, Hu went to Baili Jewelry Store at No. 252 North Hai Road, which specializes in redeeming pawned items for customers, intending to sell the pawn ticket</p>
<p>for a Price of 400 Yuan</p>
<p>to the store. The store owner, Chuan Bingyang, said that the price could only be determined after redeeming the item and assessing the quality of the diamond ring. Hu agreed and</p>
<p>Left the Pawn Ticket</p>
<p>with Chuan. Chuan then prepared the funds and took the ticket to Hengde Pawnshop to redeem the item. He was stopped by the pawnshop clerk, Pan Huasheng, who withheld the redemption money of 514 yuan and 10 cents, and took Chuan to the police station, revealing the truth. The police then dispatched officers to arrest Hu at his address and confiscated another pawn ticket, also for a diamond ring, pawned at Yuantong Pawnshop on West Zilaihuo Street for 200 yuan. The officer then went to the pawnshop to investigate and learned that the diamond ring was also a</p>
<p>Fake Pawn</p>
<p>He took them all to the police station for questioning. The police chief did not detain Hu because he had a legitimate occupation. Yesterday, Hu was transferred to the Second Special District Court and prosecuted for fraud under Article 339. Judge Qiu of the Eighth Criminal Court interrogated him. The defendant, Hu Shanqing, confessed that the diamond ring was indeed purchased by himself in France. However, the diamond ring currently produced was not his, but had been</p>
<p>Exchanged</p>
<p>by the pawnshop. The other ring was purchased from a friend named Li Maohe for 300 yuan. Li was also present in court today and could prove it. Li Maohe was then interrogated, and he confessed that the diamond ring pawned at Yuantong Pawnshop was indeed sold to Hu by himself. After reviewing the situation, the court decided to reschedule the hearing for the 23rd of this month. The defendant was released on bail with a 600 yuan surety from the store.</p>
<p>Chinese Compradors on Yangtze River Steamers</p>
<p>Completely Withdrawn</p>
<p>According to sources from Hankou, after the bombing by Chinese air force ten days ago, the situation became tense. Residents evacuated to safe areas, fearing that tanks would soon approach after the air raids. In addition to stepping up defenses, the Japanese army also paid attention to defending all kinds of temporary "local organizations" there. Important new dignitaries rarely go to the organs to handle affairs. The shipping route from Shanghai to Hankou is now dominated by the Japanese "Toa Kaiun Kabushiki Kaisha." Because Japanese ships fear being attacked by Chinese aircraft, all Chinese compradores have been completely withdrawn (Chinese compradores originally traveled back and forth between Shanghai and Hankou with the ships). Passengers are also greatly reduced due to fear of accidents en route. Because there is no war risk insurance, there are even fewer reported shipments. Both passenger and freight business have plummeted.</p>
<p>At the Intersection of Bazilu Road</p>
<p>Japanese Erect Boundary Markers</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Japanese army nailed a wooden sign reading "British and Japanese Defensive Area Boundary Line" on the wall of Delong Straw Company at the intersection of North Henan Road and Bazilu Road. It was found that the Japanese had already erected a boundary line marker next to the electric pole at the south entrance of Bazilu Road. Now, it is being re-erected. The intention is truly puzzling. Japanese soldiers stationed at the intersection of Bazilu Road and Fusheng Road have been withdrawn. However, two armed Japanese soldiers patrol North Jiangxi Road from south to north, carrying guns on their shoulders.</p>
<p>Female Jin Xiaomei</p>
<p>Sentenced for Using Counterfeit Money</p>
<p>Jin Xiaomei, a woman from Jiangyin, was instigated by Ah Ming, who is still at large, to carry three one-yuan counterfeit banknotes and fifteen double-corner notes from the Central Bank and use them at 107 Guangdong Road. She was discovered by Shu Pinfang, a noodle stall vendor, who reported it to the Chinese police and took her to the police station. Based on her confession, the police went to the home of Ah Ming, who is still at large, at No. 68 Jialu Road and confiscated 53 one-yuan counterfeit banknotes. Yesterday morning, she was brought to the First Criminal Court and prosecuted for using counterfeit national currency. Judge Feng De presided over the hearing and sentenced Jin Xiaomei to three years of imprisonment for attempted use of counterfeit money, and confiscated the evidence.</p>

<h3>Poetry and Overcoming Nature - Reading Notes - Shuang Chang</h3>
<p>Human evolution is due to labor, and culture only arises after labor. "Aiyo Hangyo" was originally shouted out because the work was too hard; the sound is simple, but from this, things like poetry are produced. Long ago, that labor cry evolved into simple poetry. When I hum "The Song of Striking the Earth", I can imagine people living in nature at that time, working freely only for the needs of life.</p>
<p>The society of Yao and Shun changed. By the time of "The Song of Auspicious Clouds", the clan social organization gradually became complete, production tools were improved, and the way of life also progressed, and further resisted nature. Yu and others controlled the waters, "cutting wood along the mountains, opening up the nine rivers, and reaching the four seas", creating a human miracle. And "Futaomo" is a kind of labor cry that encourages each other up and down. However, although humans initially conquered nature at that time, they still had not escaped its shackles. The "Song of the Emperor's War" shows the concept of nature.</p>
<p>The relationship between humans and nature had a great influence on the development of poetry later. After Yu, the rise of the production economy brought about the collection economy, and this relationship was further strengthened. Humans discovered the mystery of nature in planting and believed that there was a hidden god in charge of everything. After work, they produced a kind of flattering act of worshiping gods (together with flattering the rulers). This is the same as the four-stringed lyre poems performed in the ancient Greek games. Later, the "Nine Songs" attributed to Qu Yuan in Chu Ci was originally a sacrificial song similar to that time, but it still could not avoid mystery. The hymn of the Book of Songs "Ode" is ostensibly said to be for one's own familiar ancestors, but it is still a kind of tabooing role of Confucius who did not understand the way of nature, so he shunned singing about natural monsters and gods.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, some poetry still has not gotten rid of these kinds of factors up to now, which has made it easier for evil forces to take advantage, although it originally started from the cry of labor. As the times develop, the attitude towards nature has gradually changed, but there are also differences in quality and quantity. The cry of "When will the sun perish, I will die with you!" is ultimately too little. In the process, many let "I don't know which direction the wind is blowing!" fill it up. Human resentment has many manifestations in history: "The red sun is scorching like fire, and half of the rice seedlings in the fields are withered" all the way to "The oppressed raise their fists together", they want to resist nature and overcome evil forces. And this road is arduous.</p>
<p>Quite a few poets have mentioned overcoming evil forces; what about nature? Many people have failed to go alone. The singer of the times, Gorky, gave an example in "The Theme of Poetry":</p>
<p>...But you, forget the gods,</p>
<p>Builder who swallows the feet of the oppressor,</p>
<p>You have to choose...ants or citizens?</p>
<p>You are fused together, ants and citizens,</p>
<p>Then the working masses,</p>
<p>...we learn from nature,</p>
<p>While learning, we teach nature.</p>
<p>Gorky believes that although this poem is very clumsy, it still shows that the poet has the most valuable concept of a revolutionary philosopher, but humans are not only learning and teaching nature, but also more bravely making the power of the elements of nature follow the power of our reason and will, we leap to become the masters of nature, creating our own "second nature".</p>
<p>Nature should also be overcome!</p>
<p>When we understand poetry with this point of view, we can understand history; and we can have a more correct and strict evaluation of a certain traditional simple worship and praise of nature.</p>
<p>(Addendum: Some of the ancient poems cited in the article are suspected of being forged in their times, but their "ancient" seems quite credible, so they are discussed.)</p>
<h3>Gold Prospectors on the Banks of the Dulu River Zhu Zhang</h3>
<p>The leaves of the Chinese flowering crabapple tree snag the sunset over the Dulu River, leaning askew on the uneven mountain path, facing the desolate sound of the west wind. From the wilderness of Luobei, several sounds of rumbling donkey carts float.</p>
<p>The river flows from a screen of overlapping winds, the yellow sand beneath gently undulating. Every morning, before the mist has fully dissipated, many companions come to the river, heads bowed, silently searching for their livelihood, until night when they return with their birch bark containers full.</p>
<p>Another dawn arrives, a gust of wind sweeping over the white stone tents, awakening the river, ruffling its light紗-like skirts. A group of lively children rush over with their bags, kissing the surface of the river, dipping their hands into its embrace. At times, it will stuff a handful of sandy substance containing dreamlike riches into the hands of the children, who leap for joy, even tears flowing, thanking the river.</p>
<p>"Little bastard without a father, get out!" Suddenly a child with tears streaming down their face retreats gradually from the river under this stern threat. The river's fragrance entirely covers the body of a child with angry eyes.</p>
<p>A red-clothed girl slowly approaches with a woman whose face is full of sorrow, walking to the side of the sobbing child, raising a thin hand with a purple strip of cloth, she says wearily, "Child, who is bullying you again!"</p>
<p>The child's sobs intensify into loud wails: "He scolds... my mother," the child throws themselves into the woman's embrace.</p>
<p>"Little bastard without a father, widow without a husband, get out!" The fierce child from before shouts again loudly.</p>
<p>"Alas, a child without a father?" The woman looks towards the sun covered by thick clouds, letting out two bean-sized tears, questioning a sentence.</p>
<p>The whirring sound of panning sand continues to echo around, no one looked up a few times and made a sound—she felt that the truth was indeed too pitiful.</p>
<p>"Child—" The woman wipes away her tears, placing the crying boy and girl a little behind her.</p>
<p>"One generation's grudge will be encountered for a hundred generations." —Autumn</p>
<h3>Hope Pinpin</h3>
<p>What is hope like? An inn on a journey, an oasis in the desert, or a lighthouse in the vast sea? I cannot say, but I know that there is always such a thing as hope in the world—you probably know the story of Pandora.</p>
<p>What is annoying is, where is Pandora's box hidden? Pain, disaster, failure, disease, escaped and spread among people, everyone can see it (maybe they will come to see you, suddenly). Hope, fortunately, did not escape, locked in the box, why can't this box be found? Where exactly did Pandora hide it in a secret place!</p>
<p>People are sad because they can't find hope, and even curse it:</p>
<p>What is hope? It's a prostitute:</p>
<p>She confuses everyone, offering everything to all;</p>
<p>Waiting for you to sacrifice a great deal of shells—</p>
<p>Your youth—she will abandon you.</p>
<p>—Petofi Sandor</p>
<p>Don't be like this, good people! Just imagine: If hope is really scolded away, what will we become? Losing the inn, we will drift aimlessly to the end; the oasis dries up, we will wither and die; without a lighthouse, we will grope blindly like a blind man. Hope gives me refuge, comfort, light. People hope to fly, develop: People hope to eat, grow bigger. Relying on hope, we progress, we survive. If the whole natural world had no hope, the sun would not want to rise again after it sets, the flowers and plants would not want to be reborn after they wither, and nature would die.</p>
<p>Laziness is the enemy of hope, diligence is the friend of hope. Laziness does not want hope (maybe there are some dreams, but dreams are not hope), hope does not go to him. Diligence wants hope, he uses strength to find it—breaking through the ground, leveling the boulders—so in the sweat, under the blood, hope meets him.</p>
<p>We don't have to be disappointed, there is only one hope today, hope for the victory of the motherland, the dawn has already appeared, reach out and take it, but you must first sweat and bleed! Go, hope is coming, go meet it!</p>
<p>, said to the children who were still grumbling, "Their father is indeed gone, gone for seven or eight years, their father died in the gums of one side of the master of this field, yes, he died so tragically; but your father—is still alive? Children with fathers are happy, oh, is a father who works for our enemies happier than an unfortunate father?" The woman's voice rose, and even made the surrounding sounds of panning for sand stop. —</p>
<p>"Alas, poor children without fathers. But our children, how many of you really have fathers? Children, tell me,"</p>
<p>Dozens and hundreds of lines of hot tears rolled out from the corners of her eyes—these were hundreds of eyes full of scars, "..." Even she cried, cried excitedly. The fierce child's face became even redder, and his shoes were also wet.</p>
<p>"That's right, you are all children without fathers and only useless mothers, but do you want your fathers? Do you like your kind fathers?! Alas, children, your fathers will not come back. But, when you grow up, you will know father... Father is always present in your smart brains! ..."</p>
<p>"Yes, father? Children without fathers—" A series of fierce roars seemed to melt the opposite white snow.</p>
<p>An armed yellow-clad soldier rushed over with a gun: "What are you stirring up?"</p>
<p>At this time, one hand after another gradually lowered, the climax subsided, only to see sandbags floating on the sparkling quicksand.</p>
<p>"Oh, children, do you miss your fathers," the yellow-clad soldier said when the air was quiet, "When you finish your work, finish reading your books, go to see your fathers, be good. Oh! Old woman, don't hinder work, so they can see their fathers earlier... Haha... Hehe... Haha,"</p>
<p>The children walked away with tears in their eyes, slowly leaving the embrace of the river, they went far away to receive ten copper coins of reward. A child calmly walked back after a while, standing blankly by the river. He seemed to be cursing. "Touch..." A series of shining discs in the sunset suddenly fell on the river: "Finding a father doesn't need these stinky copper coins,—"</p>
<p>On the dusky Dulu River, all the colliding birch bark containers were gone, the river violently sent a huge wave: Crash crash crash...</p>
<p>Tomorrow, under the sun, a yellow-clad soldier will be leaning next to the river. Anxious. The river slightly let out a bitter cry!</p>
<p>"Thank you to our Dulu River for waking us up, we will never pan your quicksand again, goodbye!" The yellow-clad soldier seemed to hear a children's song, he could no longer relive the old dream of prosperity.</p>
<p>(Note) The Dulu River is located in the southwest of Luobei in Heilongjiang Province and produces gold sand.</p>

<p>The Arts</p>
<h3>The Process of Adapting "Love Sea Doubts" Yu Ling</h3>
<p>This play is adapted from John Galsworthy's "The Show". I wrote it hastily, I suffer from having little time to sit at my desk and flip through dictionaries, I owe the convenience of Mr. Fang Guang-pu's translation, and even borrowed a lot from it, which should be stated, and thanked. - Mr. Fang's translation is named "A Fuss", which is an English-Chinese translation version published by Kaiming.</p>
<p>The original play is in three acts, the first act being a rain scene. In the current Chinese stage, changing scenes is difficult, so I simply changed it to a four-act play. The adaptation was for the "Shanghai Drama Society" to use for an experimental public performance on a Sunday morning at the "Xinguang Theatre" this spring. Due to the limitations of performance time and stage equipment, I cancelled the first scene of the second act of the original play - the newspaper office scene. Now the "Shanghai Drama Society" will use it as one of the repertoire in long-term public performances. After re-reading the mimeographed version of the second act, I specially added it for publication to make it complete.</p>
<p>The reason for changing the content is entirely for the performance of "this time and this place", hoping to contact and relate to "that" thing more possibly. I hope that insightful John Galsworthy researchers will forgive me!</p>
<p>Regarding him, there have been many early introductions in China. This spring, the "Shanghai Drama Society" also performed his "First and Last". Regarding "The Show", Mr. Fang has already given a detailed explanation in the preface of "A Fuss", so I will omit it here.</p>
<p>The above is the postscript when this script was titled "Full City Storm" for publication.</p>
<p>Now the "Shanghai Drama Society" has adapted it into "Love Sea Doubts", after "Wu Zetian", and publicly performed it at the "Huangong Theatre". Speaking of the title, this is indeed a matter that has been carefully considered. Mr. Fang once wanted to change it to "Barking at Shadows", "Quarreling", "Sao Yuan", "Selling Savage Heads", "XXXX's Suicide Case", etc., and finally translated it as "A Fuss". At the beginning of the adaptation, based on the meaning of making a fuss all over the city, I changed it to "Full City Storm". After the "Shanghai Drama Society" failed to perform it for some reason, it was changed to "The Light at the End of the Tunnel" in the preview, meaning that the case in the play was constantly making a fuss, and finally the truth was revealed, like another village after the light at the end of the tunnel. Because the plot of "Another Village" at the end of the third act could not be approved, it was necessary to change the killing back to suicide. So the title of the third section was changed to "Love Sea Doubts". As the name suggests, this performance seems to focus on detective activities. Thinking of this, I once again feel the "lead-like mood". For the theater activities at this time and place, for the great Galsworthy of the original author!</p>
<h3>Films Without Male Stars Jingyuan</h3>
<p>Since there has been cinema, there has only been one film starring entirely female stars, that is, MGM's recently completed "The Women". This film is a collaboration of 130 Hollywood female stars, led by Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard and Joan Fontaine. The director is the famous George Cukor. The feature of the whole film is that there is not a single male character, only the background of a man appears in the last shot.</p>
<h3>Hotels Talk About the Infinite Emotion of the World's Changes - A Generation of Martial Artist Yang Ruiting Tianma</h3>
<p>- Thirty Years of Opera Career Vanishes</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, the Changhua Wusheng in the Peking Opera world, Yang Xiaolou of Beijing, Shang Heyu of Tianjin, were once famous. At that time, among the rising Phoenixes, Li Jirui and Yang Ruiting were also well-known artists.</p>
<p>However, over the past thirty years, the opera career has vanished his youth like flowing water, the dead are dead, the old are old, and even the sparkling generation of Yang Ruiting is already an old man with white hair and childlike face in his fifties. Recently, Ruiting came to Shanghai from Tianjin, and the reporter met him at the city building. His spirit still retains the robustness of the past. He laughed heartily.</p>
<p>"The huge Yongan Company on the seventeenth floor, more than ten years ago, was exactly my old place where I performed vigorously in Shanghai!"</p>
<p>He seemed overwhelmed by the vicissitudes of life and told me that it was the original site of Tianchan, and the "Hongzhong" hostel today was the former "Yiwuting". According to confidants, Yang Ruiting's reputation was truly invincible at that time. His famous plays such as "Iron Bow Mountain", "Changban Slope", "Taking Gordon", "Zinan Prefecture", etc., can be called the best of ancient and modern times, and they are still in the minds of opera fans today!</p>
<p>Before August 13th, Yang Ruiting once performed on the Golden Stage, performing as an old man with both literary and martial talents. His reputation and his skills were naturally a sensation. However, in the past few years, due to the war in Shanghai, he went north to Tianjin. This time, he came to Shanghai at the invitation of the New Stage to unite with the Tan School old man and Xun Huisheng. Wang Qingli, who has been paired together in Yi, also came to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The First Buddhist Film "Guan Shi Yin" on the Silver Screen Wuliang</h3>
<p>Recently, Yihua Company has also devoted all its efforts to prepare for the shooting of a Buddhist epic "Guan Shi Yin". Three or four years ago, when Mr. Wang Yiting was still alive, he repeatedly told the owner of Yihua that there were many Western films that promoted religion, but Chinese films had not yet made contributions to Buddhism, and proposed that "Guan Shi Yin" be made into a film, which would make a great contribution to the Buddhist community. Because China has a large illiterate population, although Buddhism is popular in rural areas, they all know what it is but do not know why it is. However, they do not know that Buddhist studies contain extremely profound spiritual consciousness, such as "Guan Shi Yin". In terms of Taoism, Buddhists have six harmonies and five virtues, not just cultivating Taoism. Therefore, Yihua should treat the shooting of this film with extreme caution and strict attitude, and it is heard that it will hire famous people with great accomplishments in Buddhist studies to study together, hoping to dissect the true meaning of Buddhism and give Chinese people a deep understanding of Buddhism.</p>
<h3>Wang Yurong Comes to Shanghai First Weiwei</h3>
<p>Jin Zhongren, Zhu Binxian, Sun Futing, Guan Shengxi Come Together</p>
<p>The new golden corners Wang Yurong and An Shuyuan will take the stage in early next month. Except for An Shuyuan who has already come to Shanghai, Wang Yurong will take the next Shengjing round to the south. Those who come with Wang also include supporting roles Jin Zhongren, Zhu Binxian, Guan Shengxi, Qiu Shengrong, and Sun Futing.</p>
<p>Guan Shengxi and Qiu Shengrong have not been away from Shanghai for long, and Shanghainese already have a good understanding of these two. Jin Zhongren has not been to Shanghai for a long time. This time, Yurong is coming south because the young man in this play must be Zhongren. Zhongren then came with Wang. Zhongren's Xiaosheng, in today's capital opera circle, is called the "Three Old Xiaosheng" together with Cheng Yanqiu and Jiang Miaoxiang. His art has reached the pinnacle of perfection. He has a unique understanding of Fangjin opera. An Gongzi of Thirteen Sisters can be called a unique figure, a solid typical figure. Zhu Binxian sat in Binqing Society. He came to Shanghai with Li Wanchun, but the impression he left on Shanghainese was not deep. Binxian is good at performing funny clown operas. Although he has a slight problem with his tongue, he can resonate in the hall. There are many talented clowns in recent years, but there are not many who can resonate in the hall. Binxian has made a lot of progress in recent years. After Ma Fulu left Qingsheng Society, Xun Huisheng regarded him as his right-hand man. Sun Futing is an expert in old dan roles and has been with Mei Lanfang and Xun Huisheng for a long time. He once came to Shanghai with Cheng Yanqiu last year. Jin, Zhu, and Sun are all members of Huisheng's team. This time, Jin and others came to Shanghai with Wang Yurong, which has a great impact on Huisheng's performances. However, Huisheng also has an agreement with Golden and will take over after Wang Yurong. Therefore, Huisheng resolutely agreed to let Jin and others come south. It is expected that Jin and others will not return north temporarily after the performance. After Huisheng comes to Shanghai, they will take the stage together again.</p>
<p>Wu Yanheng, the martial artist who is currently performing at Golden, is also Yurong's old partner. Since Yurong is coming to Shanghai, the Golden authorities are retaining Wu. In addition, whether Qiu Shengrong will come to Shanghai is still a question. Golden has agreed with Yuan Shihai, and Wu and Yuan have been scheduled to perform in succession.</p>
<p>As for whether the old actor Wang Yaoqing will come with Yurong, it is still questionable. Yaoqing does have the intention to come south, but I am afraid that all parties will ask for guest performances. Today's Yaoqing is no longer willing to perform on stage. The Golden authorities also very much hope that Yaoqing can come and declare that they will never insist on inviting guest performances. Zhao Tongshan (Furong Cao) has sent a letter to Yaoqing on behalf of Golden's performance. If there is any definite news, I will inform the readers again.</p>

<p>Offstage Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Member of the Board, Beile, Candidate for Taoist</h3>
<p>I have said before that as long as those who make a living by performing opera can create their own childhood name (which the northerners call milk name) and nickname and make it famous, they don't have to worry about not becoming popular. At the same time, those in Beijing who are old hands at appreciating opera are particularly happy to hide the real names of famous actors and mention their childhood names and nicknames to show that they know the actors' family history. For example, if someone says "Yu Shiqin's Thirteen Sisters" is good, he will definitely continue to say: "Zhuang Er's play is simply unparalleled;" If someone says: "Yu Jusheng's Changban Slope is very experienced;" He then continued: "Of course, this is Mao Bao's signature play." In addition, there are those who like to pretend to be old-timers, but they are only children themselves. Whenever they talk about Lanfang and Shuyan, they always say Xiao Mei and Xiao Yu, which can be summed up in one sentence, which is what those people in Beijing who advocate feudal ideology like to put on the air of "Bailing". "Putting on airs" means praising one's own status and putting on airs, which is the meaning of "showing off" in Shanghai dialect.</p>
<p>In the past, it was popular in society to shout childhood names and nicknames, so the actors not only did not regard this as a shame, but also felt that it was a glorious and decent thing. When Sun Zuochen was alive, one day he took a red business card to pay me a New Year's visit. I saw three large characters "Sun Guangtong" printed on it, with two small characters "Zuochen" next to it. I was very surprised and asked him: "The name Sun Guangtong is very rare." He replied happily: "Isn't it, according to my own opinion, it is better to print my nickname "Lao Yuan" on the business card, then the whole country will know it, so as not to cause people to guess." He did have a serious face when he said this, and he was very proud. From this, it can be seen how they value their childhood names that have been shouted by the society. Later, there was a gentleman who insisted on changing the "Lao" character in Lao Yuan into the character "Lai" to show off his knowledge, which was really a ridiculous joke. At the same time, those who are good at drawing snuff bottles are also reluctant to give their names to others casually. (120)</p>
