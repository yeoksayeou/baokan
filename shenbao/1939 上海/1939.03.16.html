<h3 id="c10">捷克的悲劇 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>今年是世界的悲劇年，在歐洲西班牙的悲劇還未閉幕，而捷克的悲劇又已重行出演。據日來各地電訊，捷克國內的斯洛伐克省和喀什巴阡烏克蘭省，業已宣佈獨立，捷克本部又有多處發生騷動；哈嘉總統已偕主張對德國無條件屈服的外長契伐哥斯基往柏林會晤希特勒；同時德匈波三國各陳重兵於捷克邊境，而德國的軍隊，且已强佔捷克摩拉維亞省的幾個要鎮，磨刀霍霍，就要實施宰割工作．捷克共和國的命運，在這內外夾攻的嚴重形势下，恐眞不免要受到極悲慘的結果了。</p>
<p>造成這次捷克不幸的原因，一方面當然是由於過去捷克忍辱退讓，自取其咎；在去年的蘇台德問題中，捷克倘能抱着「寗爲玉碎」的決心，結果未必會發生戰禍；繼熱發生戰爭，也未必會遭受到像今日的命運。同時英法等民主國家，實在也要負担一部分的責任；蓋英法既爲綏靖歐洲而壓迫捷克向德國屈服，並於慕尼黑協定中載明捷克的國境應由英法兩國加以保障；現在捷克國境遭受德匈波三國的侵略，英法等國爲什麼又不出而加以干涉呢？英法若謂慕尼黑協定中有某某條文尚未實施，故這一條也不能發生效力，這顯然是別有用意的一種推諉之辭。</p>
<p>英法不願干涉捷克問题的眞意，或許就是爲若德義最近所醞釀的要求殖民地問題和地中海問題，英法擬利用德國東進的機會，希望暫時把這兩個問題緩和下去；並以不干涉捷克問題的好意，希望德義減低對這二個問題的要求。可是事實上英法這種企圖，實不免等於一種幻想。這只看喀什巴阡烏克蘭宣佈獨立的時候，還曾致電希特勒和墨索里尼，要求德義予以保護，不過據一般人的觀察，德國政府或將循匈波兩國的要求，以喀什巴阡烏克蘭割讓給匈國，使匈波兩國的領土可以接壤。德國這種慷他人之慨的行爲，並不是對匈波表示眞正的親善，因爲她的目的，是在取得匈波兩國對德義軸心的殖民地和地中海兩大問題的同情。英法本擬犧牲捷克以減少本身利權的損失,結果却被德國利用以作向英法壓迫的力量，這又豈是她們意料所及！</p>
<p>並且捷克的問題還不是中歐問題的鎖鑰，捷克問题在最近時期內，或可告一段落；但整個的中歐，却决不會因此而不再發生其他的問题。就以烏克蘭而論，烏克藺的土地大部分在蘇聯統制之下，捷克的喀什巴阡烏克蘭，祇是其中的一部。烏克蘭是農產礦藏極豐富的地方，德國視烏克蘭爲蘇台德第二，久想藉喀什巴阡烏克蘭爲根據地，而侵入大烏克蘭。假如這次德國眞肯把喀什巴阡烏克蘭讓給匈國，實際上恐怕也祇是一種「暫時的好意」，在德國認爲需要的時候，怕不難再從匈國的手中取了回來。</p>
<p>况且法西斯的侵略野心，是决無滿足的一日。德國的東進，也决不祇限於捷克一個國家。現在助桀爲虐的匈波等國，都是她的目的物，若是在侵略者認爲有適當機會的時候，他會利用所謂大日爾曼民族的自由，和鼓動少数民族的獨立，隨時向中歐各國進攻。像不久以前波蘭國內所發生的反德運動，如德國需要發動對波侵略的話，早就拿牠當作藉口了。波蘭爲了阻止法西斯势力的東侵，曾企圖聯絡中歐各國，建立一中立集團的「第三軸心」，現在中歐各國竟一背此旨，不但不團結一致共同合作，反而對鄰國施行侵略，若捷克不幸而瓦解，唇亡齒寒的匈波，能各以單獨的力量而與法西斯相抗衡嗎？從此中歐各小國的地位，也就更加危險了。</p>
<p>所以這次捷克的悲劇，又是給英法民主國家一個深刻的教訓，要她們認讖法西斯國家的氣焰高張難以阻遏，差不多成爲鐵的事實，在歐洲是這樣，在遠東恐怕也是這樣。國際的信義破產到這樣的程度，英法等民主國家，其將坐視不顧而聽令强權势力的横行呢？或再設法訂立什麼協定，犧牲弱小，以謀暫時的妥協呢？還是根本用武力來維持世界的正義公道，並保障民治國家殘存的利益呢？現在已到了最後的關頭，若不定下積極保障的計劃，恐怕終有追悔莫及的一日啊！</p>

<p>會議宣言　此次第二期抗戰工作開始之際、各地交通、比较困難、同人負有地方經濟金融責任、在接奉財政部召集命令之後、不分遠近、不避艱險、來渝集會、共同討論、增加生產、促進輸出、平衡物價、接濟民食、開發富源等等方案、更進而研究戰時金融上·經濟上彼此聯繫相互合作、藉以策動我全國金融總動員、運用我全民經濟的整個力量、粉碎敵人封鎖經濟、破壞金融的陰謀、以達到抗戰必勝、建國必成的鹄的、同人深感覺使命的重大、肩負的艱鉅、所有議定方案、除回到本省城頭、努力切實奉行外、更爲下列宣言、以昭告於我全國海內外同胞之前、第一同人深信經濟動員、係近代戰爭取决勝負的要件、而金融機關之健全組織、業務之調整推進、又實爲加强經濟、爭取必勝的初基、過去各省地方金融機關、在我財政當局歷年指導維護之下、巳獲樹立穩固的基礎、漸進的發展、但是在此全面抗戰大時代之下、同人互相嚴密檢討、感覺還有許多尚待改善或尚待助力的地方、譬如在戰區內、如何抵制敵偽鈔券之行使、如何防止物資之被敵利用、戰區以外的地方、如何可以平穩物價、如何可以發展生產事業、如何可使民間分散窖藏之金銀、悉數掉換法幣、僅僅這幾個問題、尚未能獲得圓滿的解决、都足證明我們金融界經濟界的人還有未盡的責任、所以同人深願於此次會議後、回去迅速地於第二期抗戰階段中、儘量的發揮各地金融之力量、以推動各地經濟之進展、使其能於站在各種不同的崗位、而邁向中央共同的目標努力、即集中各地分散的經濟力量、蔚成一種偉大充實的整個威力、以促進中央財政金融經濟種種政策之成功、而無愧於大時代中各業應負之使命、第二、同人深知金融事業的盛衰、其利害係整個的、過去各地金融業容有專顧一省一行之利害、而未留意於全盤的情勢、以致國家金融經濟的政策、還不能十分貫徹地實行、此次會議之後、同人在我財政當局統一指導之下、深知國如不存、省於何有、省如不存、行於何有、所以大家應一致遵照國家整個的政策邁進、向民族整個的經濟推動、而省與中央、省與省間、省興縣鄉間、更當爲加緊一步的連擊、精誠無間的合作、排除一切艱阻、通力進行、第三同人以爲兵法有攻心爲上的格言、我們要向敵人的後方爭取經濟上的勝利、其要旨當在控制戰區內經濟中心、鞏固戰區經濟壁壘、所以我們要使敵人在戰區以內建樹不起經濟基礎、統制不了金融、其基本條件、必先要使戰區内同胞經營各業、能向我们得到經濟上或金融上便利、而使戰區內的物資、得以儘量吸收、供我輸出、人民需要得到充分供應、務便國計民生兼受其益、以後同人們必當就此方面、用一切可能的方法、同時並進、一致努力、以使敵人封鎖我方經濟之夢想、整個的失其效用、第四同人一致信仰最高領袖所指示的「敵人鎖我經濟、便是我經濟復興的機會」、這實是國家復興經濟的基本原則、並且應為我們努力服膺的正鵠、過去我國因工業生產落後、有許多的需要不能不仰賴於進口外貨、以資供給、因求供之便利、乃浸假視為固然、成為惟一供給之來源、不僅漏扈甚鉅、即國內工業生產發展、亦因之大受影響、揆之近代立國之自給自足原則、實為一種重大缺點、此次抗戰發生之後、我國海口既被敵人封鎖、經濟關係瀕於斷絕、我們經此刺激、可以覺悟到依賴進口、原非持久之道、我們自己的需要、必须由自己設法解决、進口雖然被封鎖、但仍得於無辦法之中、想出辦法、譬如歐戰時德國因海口被封鎖、硝石不能入口、以致製造火藥所必需用之淡氣、無法獲得、經苦心研究、終於發明由空氣中提取淡氣辦法、我們相信以我國土地之大、富源之廣、如能集中全國心思毅力、苦心研究發明、似不難自給自足、樹立足族工業之基礎、再就交通方面說、我國接近戰區之鐵路公路、雖被敵人破壞侵佔、但是我西北西南交通、正在極力發展、並以我國人力畜力之富、如舊式車船駚馬、加以新的整理配備、輝助運輸、也可發生相當效力、所以敵人封鎖政策、是給我們改造經濟、復興經濟的機會、是刺激我們生產建設、力謀自給自足的興奮劑、同人當更以集合的力量、不斷地努力、要使內地經濟、在最短時期之內、分工合作、迅速復興、庶使農礦工商各業、得有充裕資金之供給、以改善其業務、藉使各部分生產事業、能于最適合我現在經濟條件、經濟環境之下、得到最大之繁榮、及最速之增進、以共達多難異邦之結果、關於地方金融、財政部在抗戰開始的時候、已特加注意、去年夏天、在漢口所召集之第一次地方金融會議、宣示了改善地方金融機構辦法網要、其後又在五中全會中、通過了調劑地方金融辦法以及戰區財政金融及經濟處理辦法等種種方案、第三屆參政會中、各參政員關於經濟財政提案、亦有種種决議、同人等均願實心遵奉、一致努力力、本屆金融會議中所議定之方案、數量雖不甚多、但其所含實質、均與民生國計以及復興經濟之基礎有莫大之關係、並於前述各届議案所指示之途徑中更求進一步具體的實施、其每個議案之製成、固皆經同人最大之努力、而財政當局的剴切啟導、體大忠精之精神、使同人欽佩無既、加以最高領袖於軍書旁午之際、蒞臨賜訓、懇切詔示、使同人肅然感動、傾心悅服、凡我最高領袖所詔示之要旨、以及我行政院長財政當局所啟導之原則、將水為各個同人所努力苦幹共同之蘄向、同人深願舉將來成效之多寡、為圓報國家之測騐、更有一事使同人興奮者、即於參加會議之際、欣聞英國已與我國更進一步合作、設立外匯基金一千萬鎊、此舉對於我國金融之奠定固有相當之裨益、但同人所尤當深自努力者、友邦的合作、一方面固出於友邦之善意、一方面視乎我國之能否自强、過去種植經我院長之指導暨財政當局之努力、已使我國在國際間之地位信譽為之增高、在友邦對於我國財政金融發生信仰、樂於援助、此後我各省地方金融機關、如能各盡其所能、各秉其天職、在中央訓示之下、恊謀邁進、則友邦之合作、當必更多、而我經濟之復興、亦當更迅速、用是大會謹掬至誠、對院長暨財政當局之成功、表示崇高之欽仰、並以勉勵我同人今後不斷的努力、以期共同完成大時代之使命、而上副我最高領袖殷切之期望、謹此宣言（十一五日電）</p>

<p>「五年以來、紅陸海軍在組織上、武裝上、技術設備上、及軍事訓練上、均已有大量的、一部份甚至根本的變革、其主要各點如下、過去吾人共知、紅軍步兵在主要上、其他部隊在較小程度上、均係根據混成原則、即所謂區域制及常備制兩者編制、此區域制使吾步兵師於動員時、不得不就原有名額少而力量弱之幹部擴充、此制在資本主義各國軍隊比較亦小、而戰時亦係就原有弱小幹部擴充時、猶可勉用、但至各主要帝國主義國開始增加兵力、於平時隨時即可行動之際、即與國防需要不合、</p>
<p>「諸君均知吾人過去在邊界最易受攻之地帶、已建有要塞區域、本期內、吾人已設法更增强此種要塞、並增築其他要塞帶、使整個邊防組織根本改逆、同時要塞地帶之特別部隊兵力亦有增加、</p>
<p>「因軍隊名額增加、製配改進、軍人文化及政治要求日長、吾人乃認為必須採用政委利、</p>
<p>此外、一年前黨中委會及政府設立了十一人之最高軍事參議會、共中一人為史丹林、此會職責包括建立紅軍之一切基本的及最重要的問題之審查與解决、各軍區亦巳設立軍事參議會、最後、本期內海軍經劃出工農紅軍之外、由特設人民海軍委員會管轄、</p>
<p>「紅軍本期內名額之增加如下、苟十七屆大會時名額為百分之百、則吾人可云十八屆大會時已增百分之一〇三、此種增加非各種部隊相同、而係按照其各自的重要性分配、吾人現有常備步兵平數、較採用區域制時巳增十倍、同時每師戰時名額巳自一萬三千名增至一萬八千名、此兵力增加主要係在砲隊、由所謂迫擊砲隊至砲兵師、及機關槍隊之增加、而每連兵數亦增、現在紅軍步兵軍團的六萬人、附有適常數目之大砲、坦克車及其他軍器、</p>
<p>「法國步兵一軍團三師全體砲隊火力一發重量為六·三七三公斤、德國同等軍團為六·〇七八公斤、吾國則為七·一三六公斤、法國軍團每分鐘可放砲彈五一·四六二公斤、德國四八·七六九公斤、而吾國則達六六·六〇五公斤、（鼓掌）、苟每分鐘可發砲彈重量加地雷、步槍溜彈及槍彈之重量、則法國每軍團每分鐘火力為六〇·九八一、德國五九·五〇九、而吾國則為七八·九三二公斤、此等數字證明吾步兵軍團工農紅軍之火力、不但不下於資本主義及法西斯國、且有過之、余今不舉日本波蘭及他國軍隊之數字、雖余亦有之、緣此吾國師及軍團之組織與配備、遠在德法兩國之上、</p>
<p>「黨中央委員會、政府·史丹林·全黨及全體民衆、要求吾人國防力母落隣邦之後、諸君今親見吾人並不落後、亦無權落後、吾騎兵力已增百分之五十二、其技術配備增强如下、輕機關槍百分之三十、重機關槍百分之二十一、高射機關槍百分之三十一、大砲百分之四十三、吾人之坦克車及鐵甲車隊伍之人員、巳增百份之一五二·五〇、坦克車總數、增加百份之一九一、而鐵印車總數亦已增加七倍半、關於坦克車隊伍中之器具、已有極重要之調整、（尤其是該隊伍之大砲）、假若一九三四年、所有裝甲車及坦克車上之大砲每一發等於一百、則一九三九年巳增至三九三、又假若一九三四年坦克車上之火力係每一分鐘等於一百、則一九三九年巳增至三三四〇、</p>
<p>至於吾人砲隊之器具、吾人異常注重、在此一方面之工作、巳獲得滿意之結果、在該時期中、輕砲已增加百份之三十四、中量砲增加百份之廿六、重砲增加百份之八十五、高射砲增百份之一六九、至於吾人所感缺乏之坦克砲、防坦克砲、其增加之數量、竟超出其他各種大砲、而在質的方面、則確為第一等、以前、吾人絕無所謂迫擊砲、目前、吾人已造有此項重要大砲（迫擊砲及擲彈筒）、無論在質與量方面、已有良好之成績、大砲數量旣有增加、而在質與種類方面、亦有極大之長進、大砲之射程亦巳增强、例如各種重砲之射程已增强百份之五十至七十五、至於火力速度、亦已增强、而尤以坦克砲為甚（增强一倍）、砲彈重量及炸力、均巳增重、紅軍之防毒部隊、其工作係防禦敵軍之毒氣攻襲、並以同樣之毒氣還諸敵人之身、此項部隊已經過組織上之調整、而其力量、則倍於前、至於吾人之信號兵、亦已增强百份之三十七，彼等在技術上、及器械上、均已有良好之進步、關於防空方面、吾人巳予以極大之注意、但吾人必須承認、防空設備、尙未臻盡善盡美之境、雖然、在目前、吾人巳可目覩國內各主要城市防空設備之神速進步、高射砲總數已增加百份之二八八·三、高射砲之射程高度、亦已增百份之六十（歡呼）、在高射砲與驅逐機合作之下、國內最重要之城市、已組成嚴密之防空網、同時、驅逐機之總數巳增百份之一四二·三、至於飛行人員方面、目前總數與一九三四年相較、已增百份之一三八、以馬力言、目前之數量已較一九三四年增加百份之二一三、或七百九十萬馬力、飛機總數、增加百份之一三〇、</p>
<p>吾人之空軍、在數量方面、旣已增加、而在質的方面、亦有重要之進步、例如、驅逐機之速度、已增加百份之五六五、其高度則增百份之二一·五、近距離轟炸機之速度增百份之八十八、其高度增百份之八十三、其遠航程則增百份之五十、至於遠距雕轟炸機、其速度增百份之七十、高度增百份之七十七、其遠航程則增百份之六十一、又關於偵察機、與戰鬥機、其速度增百份之六十七、其高度增百份之二十三、其遠航程、則增百份之四十五、</p>
<p>在比例方面、亦有更動、例如重轟炸機之比例、巳自百份之十·六增至二十·六、驅遂機之比例、則自百份之十二·三增至百份之三十、換言之、即吾人空軍巳更為强盛、而其攻擊力量亦因之而增强、</p>
<p>一九三四年、吾人空軍之全部、可在一次飛行中、携帶二千噸之炸彈、但目前之容量、則已增百份之二〇八、苟敵人膽敢侵人蘇聯領土、則此項炸彈、可作為阻止「此輩瘋漢之緊身衣、」約制彼等之瘋在行為、假定一九三四年吾人空軍之機關槍火力一秒鐘為一百、則一九三九巳增至三百、</p>
<p>目前、在吾人之軍事機塲中、驅逐機及轟炸機、比比皆是、其速率已超出每小時五百公里、高度則為一萬四千尺至一萬五千尺之間、至於吾人飛機之遠航程、則已有事實表現於全世界、例如蘇聯英雄赤苛落夫·古魯莫夫·巴道可夫·大馬石夫·巴立埃可夫·達尼寗·可基那基·已故白蘭定斯基、及婦女飛行家格利斯杜白英等等、均為傑出之人材、</p>
<p>余對於海軍、尙未提及、此並非因其係屬於另一人民委員會、事實上、係由於黨及政府已决定建立强大之海軍、此項建造工作、已在噸利進行中、自一九三四以來、各軍隊所引用機械曳引巳增百份之二六〇、一九三四年、每一位紅軍人員、具有此項機械曳引計七·七四匹馬力、一九三九巳增加百份之一六七、即增至十三匹馬力、同時紅軍兵力、已增兩倍、幹部决定一切事項、關於此點、絕無問題、此亦黨及政府之中央委員會之所以如此努力覓尋眞正蘇聯軍事幹部、此等幹部、必須具有高超之軍事責任性、為國家及列寗史太林之偉大主義而奮鬥、</p>
<p>無論在質或量方面、五口人之幹部、均極優良、當紅軍進行肅淸卑鄙份子之際、法西斯及帝國主義侵略國高呼紅軍之幹部及軍力業已削弱、除法西斯侵略者之外、絕無其他人物注意此項謠言、某某國因失去其在紅軍活動之間諜、竟輕信此種謠傳、於是為「利用」此種「絕好機會」起見、該國即實行進襲卡山湖、　　卡山湖戰役之結果、盡人皆知、在紅軍恊助下、第一特別紅旗軍之長官、政治工作人員、巳將蘇聯軍隊之眞實作戰力量、以及軍長政治人員辦事之效率、明白吿示此參加海盜式冒險行動之侵略者、</p>
<p>吾人熱誠希望、凡對蘇聯有所企圖者、及所有認為紅軍實力已减弱者、均能因此而有所警惕、苟彼等以為所受敎訓尙嫌不足、則吾人之紅軍準備隨時予彼等以更慘痛的敎訓、</p>
<p>下列數字證明五年來吾幹部人數之增加、步兵軍官（包括砲隊）增百分之一一八、騎兵增百分之六六、砲車·裝甲車及坦克隊增百分之一五四、砲兵增百分之一二四·五、空車包括工程技術及服務人員共增百分之一四八、飛行員增百分之一八四、航空工程師增百分之八〇一、紅軍在平時不但為數十萬蘇聯公民學習戰術、打擊敵人之學校、亦為全體官兵學習政治知識及馬克司列寗主義之學校吾人擁有訓練軍官及軍事專門人才之學校網、陸軍學校達六十三所、求學靑年數萬人、每年畢業尉官數千人、均有良好軍事及政治訓練、忠於列寗斯達林的黨、航空學校共三十二所、其學生共二萬餘名、均由黨與共產靑年團遣送、</p>
<p>五年內、各校學生增多如下、陸軍學校增百分之一一七·八、軍政學校增百分之二七三·三、空軍增百分之一八七、紅軍有軍事學院十四所、大學特別軍事研究班六個、訓練司令·政訓人員·工程師·及醫師等、入學者共二萬餘名、此外尙有軍官約一萬五千名、求深造於夜問研究班及通訊班、又有半年及二年之初級軍學校及訓練班官、每年紅軍選派數萬戰士入學、戰時供給充分軍官人才為一切資本主義國最困難問題之一、吾人則無之、吾人在大體上已解决了戰時補充軍官之問題、吾戰士之物質生活程度甚高、軍官生活五年內亦大有改變、一切軍官及訓人員薪資、平均已增百分之二八六、</p>
<p>紅軍文化事業經費增加甚多、使全體官兵之文化水準提高不少、例如一九三叫年吾軍有列寗「角」一五、〇九一個、一九三九年增至二六、四三五個、一九三四年有俱樂部一、三三六所、現在一、九〇〇所、一九三四年有紅軍宮一四二所、現在二六七所、</p>

<p>伏氏繼論航空化學國防會及其他團體加强國防之工作、及紅軍政委及政訓人員之任務、稱紅軍生活及訓練基礎與全體人民相同、係馬克斯恩格斯列寗斯達林之學說、紅軍設有特別政治機關、除黨及共產靑年團外、此政治機關之職責為不斷提高全體戰士及軍官之政府意識、紅軍政委在此點上之作用極大、渠為軍中最負責人物、司令及政委成一共同單位、指導該軍之軍事政治敎育訓練、在軍事·政治·道德·經濟·軍需·及其他方面、兩人均共同負責、十七至十八屆大會期間、軍隊政治機關大有進步、一九三四年一月一日、政治工作人員共一五、六〇〇名、現在達三四、〇〇〇名、增百分之一二六、在淸滌軍中及政治機關本身中間諜奸細份子工作方面、各政治機關及政委之職員地位亦增加不少、近年來紅軍政治人員頗有更換、數千靑年忠實優秀黨員經從下級擢昇至負責地位步兵之戰術及射擊訓練、在水平綫上、雖此種兵種之組織各方面現均更加複雜、騎兵亦能使本身訓練與其機械化裝配之訓練配合、戰時紅軍騎兵將能表演高度之軍事藝術、砲兵亦然、在軍事及戰術訓練上、均有進步、各種砲隊·砲兵·軍官·政委·均能担當任何軍事任務、坦克兵在射擊上亦良好、能勝任一切、空軍因有優秀幹部、其特殊的及戰術的訓練亦佳、</p>
<p>上述一切已經多次實際測騐證明、紅軍訓練之良好、即敵人亦承認、彼等如吾所述、曾錯估吾人力數、妄冀奪吾領土、（十五日塔斯電）</p>

<p>並非事實、南匯城迄今仍由游擊隊于部固守、屹然無恙、是日交戰情形、頗爲激烈、日軍於十日晨間、帶同偽「軍」徐鸿發部、迫令前導、日偽混合軍約三百餘人、水陸南進、由祝橋越四　倉、乃於四　倉鎭與南城</p>
<p>十里距離間、與游擊隊開火、華軍爲于部下李嚴兩大隊、佈成弧形散兵綫、以機槍手溜彈肉搏前迫、越兩小時後、城南大團鎮特務大隊　部、又趕程北進增援、於北鬥郊外數里</p>
<p>展開激戰、顧部原爲海濱泥城之人民自衛團、均爲有訓練之壯丁編成、身穿灰色軍服、頭戴鋼帽、與正規軍無異、去冬會在泥城擊退日軍、建有奇勳、勇敢善戰、日跟雖向南城遙放小鋼砲轟擊、但不能越抵城郊一步、激戰至中午、上川路以東之川沙游擊隊張部、</p>
<p>及時趕到、抄襲川祝段鐵路、進擊祝橋日軍後背、於是犯城日軍、陣綫動搖、於午後全部潰退祝橋、是役日軍傷亡有四五十名之衆、游擊隊乘勝推進、迫近祝橋、四團倉遂亦加以克復、故南城固若金湯、絕無失守事實、川祝段張部連日每晚仍向祝橋進聾、槍斃澈夜不絕、</p>

<p>局方容認日方行動之感覺、已趨强硬、工部局昨日雖發表關於妥協事之公報、極言警務處在公共租界內之完整、惟確知日方便衣憲兵已數度在公共租界內搜查、未得公共租界警務處之許可、擅自綁架華人、至少已達十二人之多、</p>

<p>— 慤厂</p>
<p>十四日一早，別離了這愛不可言的綦江，僅走了三小時的公路，就達到重慶對岸的海棠溪公共汽車的末姑。由海棠溪渡江到重慶，不過十分鐮的時間，渡船每一小時裹，往返三四次，却很便利。</p>
<p>重慶巿依山而立，道路異乎尋常的傾斜，碼頭要比江面高出幾十尺，循着石級上去，所以建築房屋，是相當的困難。此處的房屋，都是用木板蓋迭的，外面看看，雖然也還可觀，但是內容，就簡陋不堪了。同行有人說：「一人登樓，全屋震動」，這並非過甚其詞。氣候是壞極了，成天的是雲霧迷漫，我們在重慶住了十四天，祗有兩天是晴天，而看見太陽，也不過半天罷了，聽說要到明年春後，才可以久晴呢。重慶的生活程度，高得不得了，尤其是買外國貨或是上海去的貨物，價錢更貴，五洲藥房的固本皂，要賣到五毛錢一塊，由此就可以想見其他了。</p>
<p>由貴陽到重慶，中間要以桐梓到松坎間的一段最危險，沿途崇山峻嶺，峭壁千仞，汽車繞着山道，盤旋行走，我們在車上簡直的不敢往下看，覆車的慘禍，時有所聞，今天談到此處，還是不寒而慄呢！</p>
<p>二十六日又回到貴陽，住了十天，乃又出發前往昆明。中間在安順午飯，經過有名的黃菓樹大瀑布，到實在偉麗可觀，晚間在安南住宿，此處的盤江旅社，雖不至於像　江旅館那們的惡劣，但是辦的也很壞，聽說中國旅行社要收回自辦，如果能够成功，到也是旅行者的一個福音。自安南出發，不過半里路，經過一段山路，崎嶇不堪，名字呌作「二十四之拐」，土人簡稱作二十四灣，路基全是碎石所堆，車身由上而下，那危險的程度，就不言可知了。可是沿途風景之佳，也是少見的，這天是在盤江用的午膳，晚上又到了平彝·平彝的住處，經過旅行社的改良，到還相當的舒適。</p>
<p>出發的第三天，由平彝上道，午間在曲靖吃飯，下午三點半就到昆明。昆明的地面，高出海面有一千九百多公尺，所以早晚比較的凉，可是中午就溫暖如春。昆明的風景區很多，不是三言兩語可以說得盡的。昆明的市面上，確也相當的繁盛，生活程度，雖然比不上重慶，可也是很高。此地的幣制，分新滇幣（就是富滇新銀行所發者）和舊滇幣兩種，新滇幣每元合國幣五角，舊滇幣每元，不過値國幣一角而已。談到幣制，我可要附帶着說幾句話，就是西南沿途各地，對於使用法幣，要算中央銀行的鈔票頂好，五元和十元的大票，不容易調換，也要少帶為妙。還有鎳鑄的輔幣，他們也不很歡迎，頂好還是新角票。昆明因為接連着法屬安南，所以越幣在昆明也有市面，昆明人的語言，到很好懂，他們發音，不過較北京話略為沉重一點。</p>
<p>十二月十五日，又從昆明啟程到海防，滇越鐵路，是法國人費了十年的經營築成的，工程的偉大，的確不是國有鐵路所能比較。沿路有一百六十多個大的山洞，一路上的風景，好得不得了。普通客車，每天由昆明開出，四天的功夫，就可以到達海防，這種車是白天開行，到了晚上，旅客們要下車找地方投宿的。還有一種米許林（Meschijin）車彷佛像公共汽車，前後共有十二只橡皮輪，也是用汽油發動，沿着鐵軌行駛，速度極大，山昆明到河內，不過二十二小時。這種車每個禮拜開行兩次，　等車全是皮沙發，非常舒服，三等車是木杉，並沒有二等。假如旅客們乘的是三等，到老街想換乘臥車的時候，可以在車上向查票員要求補買二等臥鋪，因為三等沒有臥車，不能安睡。米許林車祗准隨身帶行李十五公晉，還有免費的三十公斤，可以在出發的前兩天，送到車站，呌他們預先替運到老街去。旅客們的行李，到了河口，要受到很嚴厲的檢査，並且情形是非常混亂，這要自己特別的當心，而且以少帶行李為妙。旅客們所拿着的護照，應當先在河口督辦公署檢査，然後再過橋到老街將護照留給警察局，目己就可以到車站去上車，河口督辦公署和中國的海關，對於出境的旅客携帶銀錢，是要加以限制的，大概至多不能過國幣二百元，要是超出限額，就要全數充公，入境呢，可就沒有限制了。</p>
<p>在這條路上，最好是自備膳食，因為一路上很少有可口和衛生的食品，而且氣候極其惡劣，假如是飲食不愼，那就很容易生病，最好多備些金鷄納霜，每天吃個一兩粒，預防發生病苦。</p>
<p>越南人民的姓氏，是以名號的末一個字，作為稱呼的，所以往往父子兄弟不能够同姓。越南人在四十五歲以上的，多半還懂得國文，可是不會說國語，要是與他們筆談，還可以勉强。　　最後我總結的說兩句，就是往西南的旅客，第一要能够吃苦耐勞，其次要機警靈敏，行李是能少就少，可是應用的東西，就萬萬的不能少。要是由海防進雲南，那麽新一點的東西也不要帶，帶了准要上當，因為海防抽稅抽得太可怕了</p>

<p>今日爲上海特別市黨部領導各界舉行抗戰宣傳週之第五日、本市各文化團體於昨日舉行聯席會議、决定發表告本市文化界同人書、並通電全國文化界同人、一致動員全民、擁護國策、戳力抗戰建阈之大業、茲服錄如次、</p>
<p>告本市文化界　全上海文化界的同志們、自從「九一八」的血鐘響徹全世界後、我們全上海以及全中國的文化界同志、一致深信日本帝國主義者的野心、决不是外交政治等方法所可以解决、粉碎敵人侵略的迷夢、唯有拿整個國家民族的力量、予侵略者以迎頭的打擊、因此我們一致唤起全國同胞抗敵的意識、在沒有正式發動抗戰之前、全國民衆、應充份地培養自己的人力財力和物力、「七七」蘆溝橋事變發動後、我最高領袖蔣委員長大聲疾呼地號召着全國民衆、「最後關頭已到了、抗戰一經發動、就要傾舉國之力、抗戰到底、犧牲到底、爭取我們的最後勝利、」這時全國文化界首先把領袖的訓示、剴切地解釋、詳盡地分析、使全國民衆的抗戰意識、明確堅定、全國民衆的抗戰情緒、發揚蹈厲、等到「八一三」淞滬一役正式開始、全上海的文化人不僅繼續以筆桿作種種抗戰文化的工作、而且有許多文化人實際地參加了各種抗敵後援的工作、自國軍西移後、上海樅成孤島、環境萬分險惡、但我們文化人始終站在自己的崗位上、不屈不撓、艱苦奮鬥、盡了我們文化人應盡的責任過去的種種、縱不足自滿、但本以往的經騐、更可改進我們今後的工作、而且後期抗戰業已開始、有待於我們文化界同人之努力者、更見迫切、現在就文化界各部門今後應特別努力的幾點、列舉如次、以資共勉、</p>
<p>第一·新聞界　應將後期抗戰的形勢、敵我雙方實力的比較、敵寇漢奸的暴行、我國軍民壯烈的事蹟、隨時詳明地報導於讀者大衆、文字力求通俗、內容務求翔實、使全國婦孺老弱、均深明今日抗戰之大勢、共堅同仇敵愾之心、</p>
<p>第二·出版界　關於抗戰理論的書籍、應予以系統地出版、內容務求精純、定價力　低廉、對於工業羣衆的讀物、尢當加以注意、務使佔全國人口百份之九十以上的工发和農友、都有源源不絕的精神食糧的供給、</p>
<p>第三·文藝界關於抗戰文學的寫作、文藝通訊網的建立、這兩項工農界同人固曾致力於此、但其收穫、仍不足　我人之期望、我們希望文藝界同人今後特別努力、應有惊大的作品表現、</p>
<p>第四·電影界　在目前這孤島上、電影界的環境．是相當艱苦的、我們希望電影界的同志們、不屈不撓、繼續奮鬥、對於抗戰電影的攝製、應加倍努力、上海縱不能開映、我們可以送到內地去、因爲電影在抗戰文化運動中、是一個最通俗最有力的武器、</p>
<p>第五·戲劇界　話劇界在此次抗戰期中、是很有工作表現的一個部門、自國軍西移後、話劇界始終在繼續工作之中、我們希望今後、除努力於公演外、對於新劇本的製作、更應加以努力、其他若平劇游藝各界的改良運動、也是迫不容緩的事、文化的領域非常廣大、現在僅指出上述的五個部門、望我全市文化界同人、秉其「抗戰必勝」「建國必成」的信心、動員全市民衆、擁護抗戰國策、與日本帝國主義者奮鬥到底、上海市文化團體聯席會議、</p>
<p>電全國文化界　全國文化界同人鈞鑒、今日爲上海抗戰宣傳週之文化界宣傳日、本市文化界同人滦信在此抗戰建國期中、我文化界之責任、至大至急、自應在最高領袖指導之下、戮力奮鬥、唤起同胞、共堅同仇敵愾之心、動員民衆、以成雪恥復仇之功、爲民先鋒、義不容辭、謹電馳聞、切祈共勉、上海市文化團體聯席會議叩刪印、</p>

<p>— 水鳥</p>
<p>隨着長期的戎馬生活，蔣委員長年年是在行動中。早些時候，當他還捲在內戰漩渦中，就常常以鐵路綫上的火車一節或二節為臨時司令部，及起居之所。那時對敵方面，大概是缺少飛機的，而火車隨時可以沿鐵路綫開動，所以這樣的司令部是最機動的；同樣，他也曾以兵艦為來往指揮之用。及至最近幾年，他的束南西北的行踪，主要的是以飛機來去了。他用汽車的時候，慣常是前後三輛汽車同時出入的。不過他並不是處處如此，在抗戰前，每在傍晚時，常與夫人並肩出行，散步片刻。有一次，有幾個飛行員於晚飯後同到某郊野，在幾塊石頭上，踞坐着高談闊論的時候，忽見前面一男一女，並肩緩步過來，在暮色蒼茫中，瞧不淸楚是誰，繼續大聲笑談：及至走近面前，方知是委員長夫婦也來此散步，那時候，幾個飛行員，非常狼狽，把話匣子立刻關了，把烟蒂急忙扔熄了，大家一起立正行禮。可是蔣委員長並不如平時那麽嚴厲，他呌他們不妨隨便一些，並且說大家在休息中，不比執行職守的時候，不必過於拘禮。他又請大家照舊談天吸烟，雖然他自己是不吸烟的。同時，他倆自己也坐下來，垂詢他們的生活情形。這一件事可以說明他在某一種行動中，很為隨便，並不是如一般偉人的顧忌而鋪張的。不過在某一種緊急的期間，他常能以迅雷不及掩耳的快速，走向他要去的目的地，在暴風大雨中，他倐然而行，甚至其侍衛人員，一時也有措手不及之勢。</p>
<h3 id="c105">林主席之行路談 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 淸那</p>
<p>黨國元老中，年歲最長者，當推國府主席林森，氏向以儉樸著稱，對於行的問題，尤為儉約。一般人心目中，以為身為一國元首，理宜舉止闊綽，出入概以最富麗高貴之流綫型汽車代步，實則林氏除公務需要，曁特殊情形外，恒喜徒步而行，且不喜大批衛隊，或便衣隊隨之而行。猶憶二年前，筆者供職南京國府文官處時，某日曾在朱雀路遇及此聞名全國之首領，緣渠正在某書肆中，購置綫裝古書，目光炯炯，神釆煥發，身服藍抱馬褂，外罩大氅一襲，足下所登者，不過粗布鞋一雙而已！身旁僅隨員二人，出書肆後，循朱雀路徒步而至秦淮小公園，市人聞主席光臨，無不傾巷前往，一覘風采，林氏略作片刻巡禮後，即點頭含笑而去，市人對主席如此儉的，無不為之肅然起敬。國府為氏築主席官邸於中山陵園，一切陳飾，亦頗樸素，至其所備汽車，僅中等之福特式而巳。惟每逢謁中山陵時，則另備呢轎一頂，良以由陵麓至中山堂時，須歷數百級高階，如果由人扶持上下，不便良多，反不如乘轎為得計，故每歲元旦，雙十節，總理誕辰，暨逝世紀念日，中央要人，多徒步上下中山墓，林主席則獨乘轎而往，市民一見此轎，即知其中必係林主席。又春秋兩季出外遊歷時，主席更菩徒步旅行，嘗語人曰：「美麗之景色，惟步行時始能領略得之，本人雖精神欠佳，但能步行時，必多多步行，良以安步當車，其樂固無涯也！」抗戰以還，氏赴重慶後，據聞該頂常用之呢轎，早已棄置不用，甚至汽車亦不常應用，具見其公忠為國之一斑，或有在重慶遇及主席者，均謂氏之精神更矍爍，步履亦健，且常語人曰：「不久我將重回京華，為中山先生掃墓矣！」</p>

<h3 id="c107">奇特的道路 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— 企舜</p>
<p>我們在上海所看到的馬路，大多是石子路和柏油路居多，我們在內地所看到的馬路，大多是泥路和木塊路居多。當然，關於用金鋼鑽，鋼鐵，橡皮，玻璃瓶，糖漿棉花等鋪成的路，還沒有見到過，非但沒有見到過，也許連聽都沒有聽到過。</p>
<p>但奇怪的，這倒不是神話，而是千眞萬確的事實。——世界上偏偏有這許多使人不容易相信的事實。</p>
<p>這裏，我來拉雜的說一點。</p>
<p>在南菲洲金巴里的一條路，値價達五〇〇·〇〇〇元美金。他的建築，非常奇怪，在泥土上都嵌滿了光彩奪目的金鋼鑽，其中最大的一顆，大概有小的葡萄那麽大。據說那條路上，日夜都有警察看守，以防宵小盜竊。</p>
<p>在英國倫敦，有許多路，都是用鋼鐵製成的。這種路的優點，就是「堅固」，無論怎樣重的載貨汽車，也不能在路上面擦起一點傷痕來。</p>
<p>用橡皮造路，有許多好處，不過造價太貴了一點。蘇格蘭，意大利，奧大利亞這些地方，都曾試騐過，其中以奧大利亞成績最佳。</p>
<p>玻璃瓶是一種廢物，但是却可以作為造路的材料。英國有位科學家，他曾把玻璃瓶和其他各種碎玻璃，混合在一起，等它溶化後，澆入模型，製成一個個方塊，用以作鋪路的磚頭，這些玻璃磚塊，較之石子，更為堅固。</p>
<p>糖漿也是一種廢物，這在熱帶製蔗區域，眞多得可以俯拾皆是。現在在印度地方，有很多「冲柏油馬路」的「糖漿路」。這些路的造法很是簡便，代價也不能算貴。在製造時，先將糖漿用水調和，加熱後鋪在潔凈的馬路上，再用組沙蓋住，等冷了後，就與「柏油路」完全相同。</p>
<p>在南卡羅來那，他們把棉花也列入築路材料中不可缺少的一項。棉花的質地很軟，當然不能單獨應用，不過如把它夾在二層柏油之間，那就可成為網形的一個堅固物，這堅固物，與鋼骨有同樣的效用。</p>
<p>還有許多奇特的路。譬如美國有一條很別緻的道路，是用樟腦樹木塊鋪成的，外表眞美麗極了。</p>
<p>在蘇俄士答拉魯里士地方，有一條用碎玉黃寳石，孔雀綠，碧玉等珍貴品鋪成的道路，路面的華麗，和造價的昂貴，當然是不言可喻。</p>
<p>有一位科學家，他正在硏究用人造絲廠所產的膠狀廢物，和石子沙泥混合後，成為水門汀的代用品，據說這項計劃，巳屢試屢騐，我們將來對於道路上的帮助，力量一定是很偉大的。</p>
<h3 id="c108">談自行車（上） <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 騎士</p>
<p>自行車俗名脚踏車，因所佔地位不大，隨處可放，且每年納照會費四元數角外，並無共他費用，（修理費又當別論）在一切車輛中，為最輕便最經濟之交通利器。自十九世紀迄今，歐美各國，盛行斯物，丹麥國人幾每人置備一輛，沿途觸目皆是，停放之時，不必加鎖，無被竊之虞。法國每年舉行環國境三千英里長途比賽，轟動全球。聞德國將籌備五千英里比賽，盛况空前，可以預下。英國近郊則有斜坡狀賽道之設，專為一般自行車運動家使用。自行車會在該邦最為發達，每逢假日，輒見男女老幼，結隊遊行。吾國於四十年前由西僑及留美學生一度提倡，終以無良好道路，不克發展，上海張園曾建賽塲一處，不久拆毀。嗣後有人建衛樂園於海格路，提倡職業比賽，遂使業餘運動，受有阻梗，故不久亦歸消滅。該處賽塲，因斜度不合標準，賽員受傷者頗多，此亦失敗之一因也。此外尙舉行道路比賽數次，（一次為國際比賽在貝當路一帶舉行一次為道路恊會主辦在巿中心舉行成績平平，最近上海車會（該會為中國唯一自行車會中西男女會員甚多會長唐觀翼君提倡駕駛自行車作消遣或運動不遺餘力）舉行二屆自行車比賽於膠州公園，聘工部局副總董麥克諾登將軍為贊助人，觀衆甚多，對女會員自行車遊行表演，尤為讚許，足徵國人愛好期道者之衆矣。</p>
<p>自行車除男式女式外，又分跑車與平車兩種，我國巿塲稱英國貨為頭號，德貨為二號，日貨為三號，每輛價格自三十餘元起，至二百餘元止不等。銷數以平車雙飛為多，乘跑車者都為靑年學生，若輩對牌子之選擇，獨具隻眼，是以德貨絕跡市上，價値六七十元之日貨，亦寥寥無幾，英貨乃得獨霸。同昌軍行之三槍牌，安輪車行之翼牌，得利車行之來令，稱跑車三傑。平軍則因使用範圍較廣，行役遞信，店夥送貨，靡不以之代步，故價廉之雜牌日貨，銷路第一。德貨以另件為多，如鋼絲踏脚鍊條等，銷塲允佳，至於完全德貨之車，每輛售價最低亦須七八十元，故購者寗願多付十數元代價，買一堅固耐用之英國車，以免日後修理麻煩也。全巿約十二萬輛自行車，裝鄧祿普及强步車胎者，佔十之八九，近來大中華出品雙錢牌胎，營業亦佳，深願該廠推銷得法，為國貨爭光。此外書包架翼子板撑脚等，吾國亦能自製，銷路不惡，至於雙飛鍊條及鋼圈因成本關係，不克與舶來品爭一日之短長，良可嘆也。</p>
<p>自行車之購造，驟視之，似頗簡單，實則另件多至百數十種，若欲一一舉出，非一朝一夕可以畢事。跑車與平車最顯著之分別，為把手，（俗稱龍頭）車輪亦不同。大抵跑軍車輪直徑為二十六寸，胎闊一寸二分，平車車輪自二十四寸起至二十八寸止，車胎闊一寸半。跑車車架以後身焊牢者為佳，圓形之前車脚，下端實心，似璧式者，為精品，扁形與平車車脚相同者，非上品也。鍊條以英國之考文脫來最為著名，德尤字牌次之，星牌愛皮西等又次之。（未完）</p>

<p>— 頴工</p>
<p>我們不要依照美國軍隊四人一排的制度，也不要依照二人一列的制度。若以全世界的中國人，每三人一排，一齊向一定的目標地前進，那末任由他們如何走法，可是結果總是不能走到目的地。</p>
<p>這並不是虛話，我們中國人口共有四萬萬七千餘萬，現在以四萬萬五千萬為標準，每三個人成一列。倘假若每小時的速度為三英里，每日平均的速度為十五英里，那麽要走完一個地方，便需要二十二年又三百天的光景，幾乎是二十三年的時間了。至於每年每地所經過的人數，計算下來是一千九百五十六萬人有另，差不多是二千萬人了。再假若中國人的生殖率是百分之十，那麽每年又得加上四千五百萬人，若其間二千五百萬人算是兒童夭折的人數，則每年純加的人數是二千萬。所以當前列在一年之中在某地經過二千萬人，在表面上雖然是少了二千萬人，可是實際上在排尾又添加了二千萬的新國民，與一年前未通過二千萬人一般。因此之故，這長長的隊伍，便永沒有走完的一天了。</p>

<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、起落範圍仍形狹隘、全日僅七元差度、價則始終盤旋於二千零九十元左右、情勢則先疲後堅、初因上日午後之疲風未息、且某錢兌業代客幫力塞百餘兩、後以外滙略帶軟化、加以金號與某銀樓相繼吸購、故價頓由低步高、結果較上日午收軋跌一元、各方人心平穩、交易頗清、銀樓飾金依然呆定、海關金亦仍未更、中英純金均見略升、</p>

<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠期均長〇六二五、紐約銀價依然呆定、倫敦生金回漲半辦士、滙兌英對美小三厘一、對法跌一二五、對滬未更、美對英降三一二五、對法縮六生丁、對滬勿動、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開賣價、英匯八辦士二八一二五、美匯十六元一八七五、較之前收英美兩滙、均無榮辱、開後洋行雖稍來扒結、但以其時外銀行賣意尚濃、故爲狀頗平、洋行結進荷蘭·華比·麥加利某行英滙八辦士二六五六二五、兼美匯十六元一五六二五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉大五厘、計徵百分之八·五〇、此後現貨交易、供求轉稀、然日商銀行則頻吸期貨英美兩滙、照其時外銀行賣意轉呆、故爲狀略軟、近午洋行購結華僑華義港匯五十五元三七五、狀況亦稍趨緊、迨午收銀行賣價、英滙八辦十二六五六二五、美滙十六元一五六二五、結果較之前收英緊〇一五六二五、美軟〇三一二五、港滙亦貴一二五、午後週三無市、</p>

<p>終嫌皮球交易居多爲美中不足</p>
<p>連疲多日之紗市、昨則稍見上升之象、蓋以棉價高貴、廠方潤利較薄、一部份對於紗價要看好、所以吸收做心思性質之生意、仍然熱鬧非凡、一低則來拖進、但實際交易仍滯鈍不動、故雖一般做作劇烈、然基礎尚未堅定、一高稍有人來賣、則回風亦速也、總之根本解決、非有實需來扶植、市面難以大漲、專靠人力、忽進忽出、猶如皮球、伊踢彼接、互相買賣、深恐不能維持久長也、午後因實銷不旺、市象復疲、回挫五角、</p>
<p>現紗情形、最初開盤、承上日好面、微漲五角、二十支雙馬棧單價爲三百九十一元半、同行成交十包、少頃又回挫、做到三百九十一元、旋以某公司無賣出之口約、人氣驟然緊張、二十支雙馬現貨價爲三百九十四元半、跌至三元半、即刻漲起二元、爲三百九十五元半、但客銷不暢盛、午後交易仍屬平常、呌價反鬆、雙馬現貨及棧單價均跌五角惟同業買來賣去仍熱鬧、大家都屬搶帽子交易也、查全日成交統計一千四百三十八包、行情平均漲一元左右、惟綫價漲二·三元之譜、廠家未曾舉動、今日出口棉紗有七十件運香港、三百五十五件運廈門、七十九件運福州、又昨由天津來紗一千六百六十件、茲將各幫口成交之額量錄左、</p>

<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、前數日因受施密斯棉業提案有執行之可能、國內外廠商深恐新花登塲前、原棉難於購辦、故連日在市搜購頗烈、因之棉價上漲已有多日、唯近因施密斯之提案發生枝節、各業對棉市興趣大減、轉抱觀望態度、故日來棉價頗呈呆滯之狀、結果跌四五磅音、印度停市、預測跌一羅比、埃及平平、漲跌互見、昨日匯兌轉鬆、折合法幣、棉價計美棉及巴西棉每担跌七角、印棉跌六角、埃及棉跌一元餘、</p>
<p>滬市外棉交易、日來殊爲靜寂、申新頗有意購買下級美棉、唯因貸款棉關係、美國市塲此項存棉奇少、雖去電美國已有多日、結果未能搜得、昨日衹有合豐一筆交易、進美棉四百包、合送廠價爲七十八元半、其他各廠均無交易聞、茲將昨日外棉價格列後、</p>

<p>麵粉昨市續告平穩、自內地幫動辦以來、交易漸形熱烈、惟北洋幫去化依然零星、皆因當地洋粉充斥、對於申粉需要、難期開展、南洋幫亦以船位關係、日衹數千包交易、本街去化、亦無特殊開展、昨據洋行消息、最近滬上糧商、先後訂購花旗粉及澳洲粉併計達一百五六十萬包、除陸續運到四五十萬包外、尚有一百萬餘包未到、故近日洋粉售價步鬆、中次貨各疲數分、而本粉廠盤仍站四元七角原價、三號粉四元六角、四號粉四元三角、五號白袋粉供求兩少、概無成議、昨有粉三百包運寗波、今日尚有粉四千包、麩皮三千包運福州、又三百五十包麩皮運香港、</p>

<p>客秈連日到頭甚旺、行販紛求脫手、而囤戶亦不敢久儲、昨市在各方競出之下、市乃再削二三角、價落後又引起本街各戶與轉口之問津、故昨日成交數又開至四千包之譜、高貨到存較少、貨主尚不肯過份賤脫、而中次各檔則頗平軟、</p>
<p>洋米定價仍須十七元半至十八元間、新定尚難接近、故存貨頗形活動、一號西貢隨有十七元一角與十七元之價售開、小絞米前週衹十二元半、昨亦開至十三元、惟在本客逐步回跌之際、成交數仍衹數百包耳、</p>

<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南著</p>
<p>神經衰弱一症。患之者非常眾多，其症狀不下十數種，但大別之可分爲腦神經衰弱症。性神經衰弱症，及脊髓神經衰弱症三種。例如頭腦脹痛。記憶不良，失眠，心悸，頭目暈眩等，均屬於前者。遺精，滑精，久婚不育，腎水不足。精枯而薄，面色蒼白等，均屬於次者。他若腰酸背痛，骨節酸軟，則屬於後者。</p>
<p>大概神經衰弱爲症。都是由淺而深，故稍一覺察，應馬上治療，即可恢復康健，但本症並無顯明的界限，有時患神經衰弱者，亦兼罹腦弱，失眠，健忘等患，同時也患腰酸背痛症，蓋病源都因精血虧損而起。</p>
<p>人事過繁，或操勞過度。或受失業刺激及經濟壓迫，每能罹患神經衰弱症，但此若能剷除其病因，即可自然恢復健康，故有時不經過延醫服藥。而能在不知不覺間全愈，醫職一個失業過久的人，一旦獲得職業，精神感覺快慰，其神經衰弱症就可減輕，此外青年之自凟過度，荒淫縱慾，及婚後貪色斵傷，實屬促成神精衰弱症的主要原因，蓋自凟荒淫之後，遺精亦隨而出現，精血大爲減退，不論腦髓，脊髓，性機能均受影響，而陷身心於極度衰弱之中。</p>
<p>神經衰弱症的特效療法，厥爲內分泌療法，即用動物睪丸中的精質以補入人體之內，此爲最進步的新發明，而且非常簡效，患者可購服真正的睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」。日服三次，確具補腦，補腎，補血的三大功效。該劑一小時藥力開始，廿四小時即生精補腎，此外之攝養療法，電氣療法，亦屬必要，但效果總不及積極服「補體康」爲佳，惟在治療時應戒絕手淫。有遺精者，可服「耐而斯遺精片」以止之。而女子之婚後不妊，月經不調，乳　失健者，服以女用「補體康」即得回春效果，此余在臨床實騐上已多方證明，蓋市上之同樣制劑，佳者不多，且戟刺腸胃副作用甚大。惟「補體康」確有名符其實之效，常服之確有返老還童之妙。</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士　黃仲昌</p>
<p>淋病一症，其來勢甚爲兇猛而治癒復不容易。以致患者焦苦萬分。雜藥妄投。冀其早日奏功。結果，未有不使人失望者。原來淋病治療，實一艱難之事。不能隨便作爲處置。此種責任，惟富有經騐之醫師所措施的治療法，始克有濟。無如一般淋病患者，不知本身之利害，私自濫服市上劣藥，使本來可以速愈之淋病，變成難愈，蓋要求淋病之根本解決，貴於選醫擇藥是否得當，庶幾可以將淋病治癒之秘訣也。而淋病內服藥方面，尤當注重，因許多經濟不裕之病家亦能得根治之機會。</p>
<p>惟市上成藥，幾如雨後春笋，病家選擇，恒覺爲難。而據余之經騐，惟德國彼德博士所發明之「克淋儂」一藥，足可打倒一切不合理之市上成藥。因「克淋儂」爲世界各國最具權威之淋病專家所親自試騐。證明對淋病上有獨特之成功。因爲「克淋儂」服後於數小時內，即發生抗淋噬菌作用，所以實際上於數小即發生實效。其二爲「克淋儂」殺菌功效之徹底，普通一般淋病內服藥，功效既鈍，而且僅及於表面的局部，如淋菌已逃入深部而廣泛處，則一般成藥，即毫無功效。其三藥性王道，故服之保證無不良之副作用。由於以上之眾長，故服「克淋儂」無往而不利。舉凡淋毒性攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，尿道炎，膀胱炎，關節炎等，服之無不短期內奏功。外用藥則男子可用「抗淋水」女子可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，則奏功更速。</p>

<p>遺精，是荒淫縱慾後所顯的病徵，差不多每個自凟患者的人，時有夢遺現象，如若縱慾不已，則體虛愈甚，遺精頻繁，且無夢也遺，有時甚至在白畫間爆發滑精症，病象至此，自當無疑喪失了身體的健康，故宜及時治療。此外，每有年未過四十的人若覺稍一操作，即覺頭暈目眩，腰酸背痛，其原因由於多妻斵傷，荒淫縱慾，或生活艱苦，操勞過度所致，雖其年齡，而其內體與精神，就顯出異常枯萎的樣子，因此而喪失畢生幸福，且壽命也難登古稀。此時對於以上兩症唯一的挽救，第一得生戒絕手淫，避免身心的過度操勞，調節性生活，然後積極服以雄壯動物的睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」以補足人體精血的不足，經過相當時期，腦力振作，性力日健，確有俄延衰老的功效，同時應兼以「耐而斯遺精片」服之，以鞏固精關，而止遺精。</p>

<p>肺癆是一種可怕的疾病，而是一種最慢性的疾患，治時既費長久的時日，而又需大量的金錢，故有人說肺癆病乃富貴病，就是說此病有錢人才夠生此病的資格，無錢的人只有死路一條，那其實不然，不論任何肺病，以余歷年經騐所得，「補肺拿爾」一藥，確爲統治初二三期肺病之特效劑，因該劑有滅除肺病酸素之功，而使肺病菌失去其活動力，故癆症喀血，胸痛盜汗及潮熱，服之無不霍然，而對鎮咳去痰，不必假外科之手術，而能彌補肺部空洞，歐美各大肺病療養院與專家，無不以此劑指示病家自宅服用。</p>

<p>淋毒性本一極爲酷烈之一種毒素，一經侵入吾人生殖器內，一切組織，被此淋菌恣行破壞，而生殖本能，不免被受其影響。是萬不可免之事。吾人舉最要之例而言，如淋病患者一旦轉成淋毒性睪丸炎，生殖力即大受影響。查此症之生成，多於淋毒感染後之第二三星期，即由後尿道炎之轉移而來者。或因在慢性期間，怠於攝生，及誤服一般劣藥，使抵抗力減少，病勢挺進。成爲是患。惟此症初起時多發於右側，故名爲副睪丸炎。其初症候爲全身倦怠，惡寒，食機不振，鼠蹊部有牽痛之痛，及尿意頻數爲其前驅期。繼又突發睪丸劇痛，發熱睪丸下垂，大便秘結。此時必須作適當治療，否則往往有陰囊水腫，膿傷破潰等危險，不幸而變成此症，則其生育必發生關係。</p>
<p>原來睪丸爲製造子之重要器官，若失去此等器官，則生殖原素已絕，不能更望有何生育之事。即不然，生殖力亦減少，夫妻愛情亦不能長此維持矣。余曾治一朱姓病人，亦患急性睪丸炎，其右側睪丸腫大下垂，大有侵入左側睪丸之勢，形勢險惡，急來我處治療，乃爲之用特製提睪帶，以支持其下垂外，更用淋病聖藥「克淋儂」及靜電療法，約三星期後，痛止腫消，前後約治四星期而完全根治。按朱君之病，如再遲延二三天，即侵入左睪丸，治療更棘手矣！</p>

<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>現代的歐洲，已經成了沸水鍋，眞所謂一波未平，一波又起。西班牙內戰似乎可吿一段落的時候，捷克的第二次分割，又吿成熟了。將來的結果是否熱汽高漲，鍋爐爆裂，現在還不能預斷，但是這種趨勢，却的確已經形成，說不定竟會有這樣的一日。</p>
<p>昨天，斯洛伐克與烏克蘭兩族同時宣吿獨立了，這樣改造世界史的大問題，關於其前後及經過，當然會有專著或大文章，來加以論列的，現在，我只好略識一些感想於此，以貢一得之愚。</p>
<p>我覺得歐洲的局面，德義完全立於主動方面，而英法處於被動方面，其他各國，則更處於被動的被動方面。不但如此，德義彼此有通盤計劃，各自也有整個計劃：對於某國，某事，應抱何種態度，應何時發動，何時收塲，目的為何，如何進行，……無不條分縷析，詳盡無遺。眞所謂知己知彼；進可以戰，退可以守。不像英法那樣，平時泄泄沓沓，　預糊塗，一聞警報則慌張惶急，不知所措，至多也只能頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，受人侮弄。</p>
<p>這種情形，在前是如此，在現在也還是如此。在前，只好倉卒之間，移尊就敎，簽定了慕尼黑恊定，在現在，該恊定的墨瀋還未乾，出了這樣的大變局，一時無法可想，只好自為解嘲說，「因某某種條件尙未實施之故，……英法兩國自無出而干涉之理，」如聞其聲，眞是可憐！</p>
<p>其次我覺得，法西斯的惡勢力，如果不早予撲滅，將來還要大見伸張。因為法西斯的生存條件，是對外侵略，將來弱者被併呑，强者起而效尤，乃是必然的結果。然而要撲滅牠，似又非所言於英法。</p>
<p>也許張伯倫和達拉第，弄得焦頭爛額，從此再也不敢管他國的閒事了吧，那末我們只有等到要求分割殖民地時，看他們的顏色了。</p>
<p>水是沸了，鍋是燙了，也許要求殖民地這件事，就是最後的一把柴！</p>

<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>戰地生活　　不知那裏來的那末多蚤，睡在地上也好，睡在桌子上也好，每夜總是咬得我一刻也不能安寗。白天工作了一天，夜裹應該靜靜的休息休息了，然而，我只是搔這裏，搔那裏的忙碌着，渾身腫起了一個個又癢文痛的疙瘩。這太使我痛苦了，我嘆息着，我忿恨着，我恨這蚤有帮助敵人的漢奸嫌疑！對付敵人是容易的，但對付這蚤，我弄得簡直沒有辦法了。</p>
<p>一連熬過了幾夜，大概太疲倦了吧，這夜，我蜷屈着脚才躺在那張短短的桌子上，便　呼呼的睡着了。但當我正甜蜜的熟睡着時，忽然，一個聲音在向我呌着：</p>
<p>「李喬！李喬！」</p>
<p>我被這討厭的聲音呌醒了。但我仍用灰毡蒙着頭，一動也不動的躺在那裏。我還希望睡一睡，我沒有答應那呌我的聲音　　「喬喬！李喬！——着你巡邏了！」　　聽了那最後一句話，我再也不能還假裝睡着了，便一骨碌爬了起來：</p>
<p>「什麽，又着我巡邏了？」</p>
<p>「第一班的巡邏回來，當然，着你們第二班的了。」</p>
<p>沒有什麽話說了，雖然兩隻充血的眼睛是那末　睜得開，雖然我極希望能再睡一睡，但我不能丟開了這任務，我便趕忙穿着衣服……</p>
<p>門外正下着大雨，那聲音嘩啦嘩啦的，强烈的綠色的電光，不時從門縫裏透進來，使人有些目眩。</p>
<p>槍砲聲在那嘩啦嘩啦的雨聲裏猛烈的響着，尤其是那機關槍聲響得那末緊密，那末淸脆，就好像敵人已打來門外似的。</p>
<p>「趕快掮着槍出去，你們聽聽這槍聲！……」</p>
<p>在這一個催促聲裏，我們三個人掮着槍，冒着雨，走出房外去了。</p>
<p>地上滿是一塘一塘的泥水，望着就好像一塊塊白淼淼的石頭似的，把脚步向着那裏踏去，磞——泥水飛濺了起來，一隻脚已濕淋淋了。</p>
<p>沒有一會，頭上身上已濕透了。雨滴像汗似的在臉上流着，我們端平了上着刺刀的槍，凖備着把刺刀戳進突然來襲的敵人的胸口裏去！但大地上什麽也看不清，只有荘外的那幾顆柳樹，像一個個巨人似的在矗立着。由野裏的那一片麥苗變成汪洋的一片黑海了。</p>
<p>混亂的響着槍砲聲的禹王山脚下，和白天顯得那末秀麗的禹王山，被黑海吞噬去了，就只有那鳴鳴的呌着的子彈在黑暗中密密麻麻的在交織着……！</p>
<p>我們拖着一雙糊滿了泥巴的笨重的大脚，艱難的在泥濘的土路上滑着。忽然，一個聲音從寂無一人的前面擲了過來：</p>
<p>「什麽人？」</p>
<p>「巡察隊！」</p>
<p>「口號？」</p>
<p>「前進！」</p>
<p>「不是？——」那聲音變得非常嚴厲，接着是裝子彈的聲音：「你們究竟是什麽人？」</p>
<p>看着對方好像就要把槍打過來的樣子，我們也把槍彈裝進瞠裏去，用食指緊扳着槍機，——但我們知道那帶着雲南腔的對方不是敵人，他一定是同我們發生誤會了。可是，這怎麽辦解除這誤會呢？世間許多悲慘的事都發生在誤會上，難道我們……</p>
<p>「我們是一八四師的巡察隊，怎麽你……？」</p>
<p>「我也是一八四師的！」對方突然變得緩和一點了：「可是你們的口號不對！」</p>
<p>「你的口號是什麽？」</p>
<p>「努力！」</p>
<p>「呵，那是上半夜的了，怎麽你——！」</p>
<p>「那是上半夜的嗎？他們怎麽不來換班？——呵，對不起，差點自己打起來了！」</p>
<p>我們的哨兵，似乎感到一種無比的羞愧。但我們並不責備他。我們默默的從他的身旁經過時，我們偷眼望了一望他，他也同我們一樣的，一點防雨的東西也沒有，一個身子全濕透了。但他却那麽雄糾糾的站立着。</p>
<p>「同志，不冷嗎？」</p>
<p>「你們也不冷嗎？」</p>
<p>「我們——哈哈哈……」我們笑起來了。</p>
<p>「哈哈……」他也笑起來了。</p>
<p>我們走開了，討厭的雨，忽然又下大了起來，槍砲聲也跟着熱鬧了。我們睜大着兩隻疲倦的眼睛，默默的只是走着，走着……等候着天明！</p>

<h3 id="c149">救亡並不是復古 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— 晋伯</p>
<p>好像有人指摘過抗戰文學中也有「抗戰八股」，那意思究竟是怎麽一回事，我却還沒有弄明白，不過我覺得這名詞根本便用得不大高明。然而我們救亡文學中的某一方面有些復古的傾向，却是實在的。</p>
<p>要是這傾向不能算好的傾向，我以為倒眞有指摘一下的必要。</p>
<p>不要說得太遠，從前我們有過宋末底國難，又有過明末底國難，那些痛史正値得我們回顧和發掘。但是我們現在的國難，畢竟不是宋末底國難和明末底國難。宋末當前的敵人是蒙古人，明末當前的敵人是滿洲人，而現在當前的敵人却是有飛機大砲的日本。現實旣然不同，應付這現實的文學自然也就不同。宋末抗敵英雄底作品和明末抗敵英雄底作品，我們自然應該誦讀的，然而若是現在我們也要寫那種形式的作品，却就未免有點不大對勁。固然救亡文學是全面的，不過這全面應該是現代的全面，也就是眼前現實的全面，而不是一定要拖住些舊的花樣，這纔算是全面。——自然，我並不是說要丟開歷史。</p>
<p>要具體地舉出事實來也可以的。醫如就是寫詩罷，好像自從抗戰以來，舊詩忽然走了紅運。不錯，有些不能寫新詩的人，只要站在抗戰方面，能寫出一些好的舊詩，也是値得我們表揚的，不過那作用却畢竟有限得很。但是若果一向是寫新詩的人，竟然放下新詩不寫，而不斷地掉起了舊詩，就是眞的表現了抗戰的精神而且也眞的寫得好，那却終究不能不算是倒退的現象。那結果不但不是全面，而且怕連半面也佔不到。再醫如翻印民族思想的古書罷，不用說，那是一項最重要的工作，然而儘管是為了救急，却也應該費一點整理的手續。要是不標點，不分段，不加必要的註解，只是照原樣印了出來，雖然比較不印總要好些，但是，意義却要减少許多。</p>
<p>這說的似乎只在形式方面，然而實在並不簡單是形式上的問題。倘是不信，假使現在有一篇宣言，雖然內容是抗戰的，而用的却是饒漢祥式的「四六」文，你且讀起來試試看。問題是：救亡文學或抗戰文學並不是主觀上只說一點救亡或抗戰的話便算數，實際上還要有宣傳的效果和敎育的效果的。而恰是為了要有這兩重效果，所以就得要用活的形式纔行，——現代一般能瞭解的形式纔行。</p>
<p>好像什麽報上曾經介紹過一本新出版的「玉庵恨傳奇」，據說所叙的是陳圓圓的故事，而是用救亡的觀點寫出來的大著。自然，要說那是救亡文學，誰也不能吾認。不過我雖然沒有見過那部書，但據我想來，就作為那藝術是在「桃花扇」以上罷，那意義，却遠不及胡山源底「江陰義民別傳」和「嘉定義民別傳」一類的著作。理由是很簡單的，我們需要向大衆宣傳的活的歷史故事，而不需要只有少數人瞭解的「古雅」的傳奇。</p>
<p>做「古雅」的作品，內容還是不離救亡，這種「個人的事情」似乎該有存在的權利。——要這樣說，自然也沒有甚麽不可以。不過現在這種「個人的事情」似乎還是愈少愈好。滿臉雪花膏，固然與救亡無關；但是戴起了相公帽，穿起了粉底靴，却只能復古，也很難救亡。</p>
<p>不過我得聲明一句：我指摘的只是復古的傾向，却絕對不是反對大衆化的舊形式的採用。舊詩無論如何不是「五更調」一類的大衆歌，傳奇也無論如何不是「蹦蹦戰」一類的六衆劇。而且就是採用大衆化的舊形式時，也還應該費一點整理手續的。</p>

<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>『我……我那里有……有這許多錢！』楊岳梁嚇得連說話都有些期期艾艾了。</p>
<p>『哼！眞人面前何必說假話！誰不知道你家裏有藏銀！』獨眼李冷笑地說，隨即便借翻譯的口，吿訴那軍官楊岳梁家裏有藏銀的事，軍官京呌手下到屋裹上上下下的去搜。</p>
<p>楊岳梁的一顆心只是在腔子裹亂跳，他這時才知道沒有國家軍隊的保護，私人的財產也是保不住的，可惜到他覺悟已嫌太遲了。他眼睜睜的望着裏面，直到去搜査的那幾名X軍，仍舊空手出來，纔算放下了心。</p>
<p>可是X軍官却不肯放過他，一定要他說出藏銀的地方來。楊岳梁那里肯說，X軍官一怒之下，便呌手下把他弔起來。廳堂的左樑上，本來套着粗蔴繩，是收租時繫司馬秤的秤紐作稱稻用的，這時却把他左手大拇指權代秤紐，高高的弔起。他的身體原本肥胖，要用一枚大拇指來維繫全身的重量，怎麽忍受得住，痛得他殺猪也似的大呌起來，可是仍舊一字都不肯吐露。X軍官又呌人用火焚炙他的腋下，楊岳梁忍痛不過，只好實說銀子都藏在牀底下的地窖裏面，這纔被放了下來。</p>
<p>不多一會，窖藏都被起發出來了，在大廳上堆成了一座白花花的小山。以前葉團長也知道楊岳梁有藏銀，曾勸他默出來，或者照市價賣給政府，因為生金銀對國家的用處是很大的，楊岳梁却誤會他是看想他的藏銀，一口回說沒有，誰知現在却被魔手攫了去。楊岳梁眼看着他多少年心血積聚起來的財產，都變成了流水，不禁一陳急痛攻心，竟變成了失心瘋，在廳堂上亂呌亂跳，而且伸手向X軍官抓來。X官拔出了手槍，砰的一聲，便結果了他的性命。</p>
<p>像楊岳粱這樣卑屈地死去的人固然還有，但更多的却是壯烈的死。自從X軍佔領了合浦鎭以後，鎭上平添了不少貞婦烈女，其中有拒姦不從，被X軍刺死的，有恐懼被姦，投河跳井自殺的，也有被姦後羞憤自縊的，但死得最壯烈的却要算醫生余楚南的夫人。就在合浦鎭失陷的當夜，有一個喝醉了酒的X軍，闖進門來，要想犯她，她自度不能避免，便假意答應，引他走到後窗口，突然抱住了他，跳到窗下的河裏去。那X軍落下了河，還掙扎着想爬起來，却被她牢牢抱住了不放，終於雙雙溺死在河裏。</p>
<p>這件事，合浦鎭上的人都在暗中當做美談。第二天一早，金楚南便從合浦鎭逃了出來，去投奔葉團長，他對自己發着誓，一定要代他的夫人報仇。（三四）</p>

<p>此外好萊塢製片界亦對於中國日生好感，各製片商紛把中國抗戰故事作為脚本，對於華籍演員所貢獻的意見，無不儘量採納，製片商過去以為中國人非醉生夢死，即蠢頭蠢腦，目下此種觀念，已完全剷除，而華籍演員的地位也顯得昨日今朝大不相同矣。</p>

<p>南人學皮黃，咬字不易凖確，如前錢等字，蘇州人必唱如齊音；尤其是旦角說京白，每每以為不稍放鬆，認眞着勁吐唸，乃致鬧出笑談。曾聆一南邊票串探母公主，唸到「……禀明母后要你的腦袋」句，將「要」字使力為「咬」字，聽者誤聽以為公主咬叫郞之腦袋矣。又有一戲敎習某言曰：嘗遇一蘇人學唱賣馬。一個馬字，總與駡字相近；以就其方言字音，令其直唱買字，果能强同。</p>
<p>二進宮一劇，為生旦凈各重於唱之正工戲，似無分正配，必工力悉敵，始見緊凑，苟一稍弱，乃整個鬆懈矣。有人說後來之聯彈對唱，不無脫胎於此。然所謂聯彈，又何嘗如彼之精采耶！即以此劇三人對唱一節言，自以不讓板而頂接者為有完美氣，否則减色。又旦角之第二段唱，必須仍唱慢板，唱原板者則為偷工减料。曾聆王熙春在電台播音，不唱慢板，聞者非之，最近觀天蟾管紹華演此，旦角雪又琴頗能守範循矩，不得不認為勝王一籌也。</p>
<p>伶人於台上，最畏鼓手，蓋成敗必系之也，然亦有徒使鼓手窘於伶者，吾友于景枚君言，旦角趙芝香與鼓手有嫌，某日演蒲關。趙於上香祝禱一塲，在唸「神聖哪」之後，續連又唸「神聖」二字，鼓手在哪字之後，以為起呌唱，乃下一哆囉點子，不料與趙之第二個神聖白口相碰，致受奇窘，鼓手卒服膺之。</p>
<p>黃桂秋演茍慧生劇本元宵謎，通體相同，僅於旦角唱句中，自改一二，並易二黃為西皮，而刪去四平調，劇館宣傳，所謂與普通所演有異者，殆即此耳。該劇為予與張冥飛君所編，總本會公開於民國十六年出版之張振宇君為慧生編集中，嘗商於陳墨香修改不洽意之塲子。今黃一仍原本，未足慰所望也，黃演此劇，於其身分與摹個性處，不盡配稱，可見何類戲，亦有宜於何人，或不宜何人者。慧生在四名旦中，雖短於嗓音，然為切合劇情計，遇合於悲怨情緖者，且用二黃。今桂秋獨否，似覺未能增進聽衆情感興味，黃嗓固富且裕，不知摒棄二黃之意何在也。</p>

<p>電影界天字第一號的胖子就是殷秀岑，看他走起路來遙搖擢擢的神氣，大有「天下無匹」「惟我獨胖」的光榮，。據他自己說他幼年的時候，身體輕小得可憐，想不到有一年竟突然地胖了起來，而且胖得有點奇特，弄得全家的大小老少，求神問卜，有疑心他是患了水臌脹的毛病。而今殷秀岑是胖定了，為了胖，不免時常惱恨，原因是：吃包飯要付二客飯錢：做西裝要六碼料作；買硬領要定製三十寸的；乘黃包車要給二倍的車資。當年他在天津的電影學校裏讀書，同學之間，全體見面的機會很少，也許因為他的姓名「殷秀岑」三字像個女性，竟接二連三的收到許多情書，情書都是男同學寄給他的，信上左一句「秀岑女士，」右一句「秀岑妹妹」，而且下面又寫了一大堆「我愛你」這一類的肉麻信，簡直把殷秀岑笑得像　阿彌陀佛。</p>
<p>沈西苓的綽號是「怪物」，他的怪，是怪在生活的沒有定律。他不歡喜上理髮店理髮；他不歡喜修鬍髭；他不歡喜洗臉；他不歡喜洗換襯衫；他不歡喜洗脚，而且吃飯睡覺他不歡喜要有一定的時間；為了這一切，別人就替他取了怪物這綽號。不過，他為什　對於生活竟如此浪漫呢？理由十分簡單，因為他愛好藝術，因為他忠於藝術，他巳把整個時間與精神花費在他從事的工作上，於是就不得不將自身的一切遺忘了！</p>
<p>現在大家都知道實業界裏面有一個任矜蘋，可是這位老任却是若干年前電影界裹的健將。這位先生可謂趁中國惟一的理想家，他常年挾了一隻公事皮包跑東跑西，那公事皮包裏不是什麽巳辦或待辦的公事，而是一件一件的計劃書，但是命運不濟，他的計劃是很少有實現的。他時常吿訴人：「你看我老了許多吧？是的，這一次的計劃又耗費了我的心血腦汁不少」。</p>
<p>若干年來爬在電台上播音的徐哲身，本是舊文壇的一位老將，章回小說寫得好，而詩詞更寫得不差。他因年輕時看書太多，把兩眼弄得近視，如今巳達二千度，戴了眼鏡看報紙，鼻頭還是時常跟報紙磨擦。他的天資十分聰明，但是不會打電話，不會搭電車，弄不清上海的馬路。</p>

<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>李吉瑞以七齣半戲享名一時</p>
<p>俗諺有句話「矮子語聲高，」在梨園行裏的確有不少的人，可以證實這句話是很對的。像汪桂芬，李吉瑞，郝壽臣，老雙處，小達子，這些人，都是身量短小而嗓鬥很高很響的。在上述這幾人中，尤以李吉瑞的身個更矮而嗓音更為宏亮，當他立在合上的時候，雖是靴底襯得很高，身體挺得筆直，但是在一般看客的眼光中，總以為他像一個小孩子似的在台上跑來跑去。吉瑞一來因為自知不宜於長靠戲，二則他對於武工也沒下過硏究和鍜鍊的工夫，所以他一生　演的戲，總是以穿箭衣馬褂，英雄衣一類的服裝時為多。論起他會經享過盛名的幾齣武生戲來，也實在覺得可憐的很，據一般老於顧曲的人們替他估計一下，統共也不過七齣半戲，就造成他個黃派傳人的頭銜，這未免太便官他了。他這七齣半戲的戲名兒就是「獨木關」「銅網陣」「刺巴杰」「連環套」「落馬湖」「請宋靈」「風波亭」這七齣整戲，此外還有半齣戲就是「翠屛山」了。這齣戲所以祇算是半齣的，就因為這位李老板不會「殺山」的耍刀，他每貼此劇，不是不帶「段山」就是與別的武生合演，由這位武生接演「殺山」一塲，因此就只能算他的半齣傑作了。</p>
<p>從前平津各戲館演戲，生，旦，凈，丑，都是好角，戲價又賣的特別便宜，並且各大角至多一連出演十天八天，就更換別的角兒接替下去。所以像劉鴻聲，李吉瑞，這般人，能有個七八齣拿手的戲，就很够對付着吃一輩子的啦。後來上海各戲院派人北上邀角，一下來就是幾十號人，旅費佔了很大的數目不算，來到上海還得預備寬適的住處，豐盛的飲食，這樣一合算，非得唱個一月兩月，不能在唱角身上獲到利益，故而只要平角南來，就得定下一月合同，再加上每月中四個星期日的白天戲及臨別紀念幫個十天半月的忙，如此一來唱角就得會四五十齣戲，才能不燙剩飯。</p>

<p>Fuliang:  Fighting within Duchang is developing. On the 14th, at 5 PM, Japanese troops advanced in two directions: one from Xiabao (5 kilometers north of Duchang) and the other landing outside Xiaonanmen, attempting to attack Duchang County. They were repelled by the defending Chinese troops (Telegraph of the 15th).</p>
<p>Fuliang: At 1 PM on the 13th, over a thousand Japanese troops, under the cover of eight Japanese aircraft, landed from the east bank of Poyang Lake from the directions of Huishan, Luosishan, Qingshan, Pingfengshan, and Ma'anshan (belonging to Duchang).  They engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army for about three hours. A portion of the Japanese troops, about 300 or so, at Pingfengshan, fled to Xuhongqiao (18 kilometers north of Duchang), showing signs of attempting to invade Duchang from the south (Telegraph of the 14th).  Fuliang:  At 12 AM on the 14th, two Japanese warships and ten motorboats, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, landed in the eastern territory near Daji Mountain, and are currently engaged in fierce battles with the defending Chinese troops (Telegraph of the 15th).</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) East bank of the Xiang River in Central Hubei: In recent days, Japanese troops have repeatedly attempted to secretly cross the river to spy on Shayang. They have been shelled by the Chinese army across the river, suffering hundreds of casualties. Fierce artillery battles are still ongoing across the river. Chinese defenses on the Xiang River are consolidated, and a certain Chinese unit on the east bank is advancing towards a certain location to attack the Japanese rear (Special dispatch, 1 AM on the 16th).  Guilin:  At 2 AM on the morning of the 13th, three Japanese boats and four motorboats on Poyang Lake shelled Huiqing, You Tao, and Mozhu. Three to four hundred men landed at Pingfengshan from the Japanese boats at 5 AM.  The defending Chinese troops suffered heavy casualties and withdrew from Pingfengshan at 9 AM. In the afternoon, Ma'anshan also fell. At the same time, Japanese troops landed at Diesishan and Huishan. It is estimated that only about a thousand Japanese troops landed, and it should not be difficult to repel them (Telegraph of the 15th).  Wanjiabu:  The front line of the Xiu River has been quite quiet recently, but due to continuous spring rains, the waters of Poyang Lake have risen, so Japanese troops have become active within Poyang Lake.  On the evening of the 13th, two Japanese warships and five or six motorboats landed about two to three hundred Japanese soldiers at Laoyemiao, belonging to Duchang on the opposite shore.  A fierce battle ensued with the defending Chinese troops for a long time, with heavy casualties on both sides. Chinese fortifications were completely destroyed.  As of 7 AM on the morning of the 14th, the Chinese army had shifted to a new defensive position at Wangjiaxiang to hold the line. At 9 AM, over ten Japanese aircraft heavily bombed Duchang and Xujiapu.  Until 3 PM in the afternoon, two more Japanese warships and over ten motorboats landed at Xiabao, several miles east of Duchang. The Chinese side has dispatched teams to strictly block and strike at them, and fierce fighting is currently underway (Telegraph of the 14th).  Shashi: Military news: (1) The Chinese and Japanese armies are engaged in fierce artillery battles across the river from Shayang; (2) In the area from Jiukou to Zhengjiaji, there are over two hundred Japanese infantrymen, two heavy cannons, and over thirty guns.  Japanese cavalry units of one to two hundred frequently travel back and forth to Zhongxiang, but there is no garrison.  The main force of the Japanese army is between Fenghuang River, ninety miles north of Zhongxiang; (3) Over three thousand Japanese infantrymen, over six hundred cavalrymen, and four heavy cannons have moved south from Zhongxiang to places like Shagang and Jiukou. According to those who escaped from the Japanese side, the Japanese army claims they will attack Shayang; (4) The Japanese on the opposite bank of Shayang transported four bundles of cloth boats, and two bundles of military canvas boats to Jiukou, and are preparing bridge-building materials, seemingly attempting to cross the river by taking advantage of the opportunity (Telegraph of the 14th).  Fuliang:  At 12 AM on the night of the 13th, three Japanese warships and four motorboats patrolled the lake surface in the Laoyemiao and Daji Mountain area (about three kilometers west of Duchang), and shelled the shore. At 5 AM on the morning of the 14th, three Japanese warships and nine motorboats, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, landed near Daji Mountain. The defending Chinese troops calmly responded to the battle, and eventually repelled the landing Japanese soldiers (Telegraph of the 14th).</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese military sources, the Chinese army in Hubei, since the counterattack, has recovered several important villages and towns, including Yangjiaze and Yangzi Town. Its vanguard has reached the vicinity of Zhongxiang and is currently continuing to advance (Quick News Agency, 15th).</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army is currently exerting all its efforts to operate Hainan Island as a base. The Yulin and Sanya naval ports, and the Haikou airfield, are still under active construction. Japanese troops from Humen and Guangzhou are continuously being sent to reinforce the various lines in eastern and western Guangdong Province, and fierce battles will soon unfold again (Quick News Agency, 15th).</p>
<h3 id="e2">Great Victory for Chinese Army in Northwestern Shanxi; Over a Thousand Japanese Soldiers Killed at Limin Fort; Chinese Army Attacks Suburbs of Shenchi City <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Xingji: After the arrival of a fresh force of a certain Chinese army to Shuoning, Northwestern Shanxi has immediately achieved an unprecedented victory this year. On the evening of the 11th, Japanese troops advancing south from Shuo County invaded Limin Fort. The Chinese army, taking advantage of the Japanese army's unstable foothold, preemptively launched a major raid, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers. On the morning of the 12th, the fort was recovered, and the remaining Japanese troops retreated to Xinzhuang. That night, the Chinese army attacked Shenchi and occupied the villages in the northwestern suburbs. The Japanese troops fled into the city and to the Southern Mountains. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory and crossed the city, fighting fiercely until dawn. The Japanese army then sent reinforcements to fight in distress, and the Chinese army withdrew voluntarily, obtaining guns, banners, food, and other items. Furthermore, on the 13th, Japanese troops were defeated by the Chinese army in Jiangjiagou and the mountains northwest of Heilongguan, suffering numerous casualties. The remaining Japanese troops fled back to Heilongguan (Telegraph of the 15th).</p>
<h3 id="e3">Lancheng Recovered <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Xingji: (1) The Chinese army launched a counteroffensive against Lan County starting on the 10th. At 3 AM on the morning of the 11th, they approached the suburbs. Some soldiers voluntarily requested to form a Dare-to-Die Squad and charged into the city, leading to fierce street fighting. A certain Chinese regiment followed up and advanced, confirming the recapture of Lancheng at 4 AM. The remaining Japanese soldiers scattered and fled to Jingle. The Chinese army is currently pursuing them. In this battle, over fifty Japanese soldiers were captured, along with one light machine gun and over two thousand rounds of ammunition; (2) According to reports, the Chinese army recaptured Dawu again on the 11th; (3) In recent days, the Chinese Air Force has continued to bomb Anyi, Yuncheng, and Jiexian (Telegraph of the 14th).</p>
<h3 id="e4">Chinese Armies in Northern Jiangsu Establish Contact; Retreat Route of Japanese Troops in Huai'an and Huaiyin Cut Off; Fighting Continues in Huaihai, Funing, Yancheng, and Shaobo; Japanese Troops Pinned Down, Prospects for the Battle Situation to Develop <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>A Certain Location: The vanguard of a certain Chinese army has reached the border of Koukou, and the main force is continuing to advance, simultaneously launching a counteroffensive with the troops remaining in Huai. The retreat route of the Japanese troops in Huai'an and Huaiyin has now been cut off. The Chinese armies of Funing and Bin also launched a counteroffensive. The battle situation in Northern Jiangsu can improve (Telegraph of the 15th).</p>
<p>A Certain Location: The main force of the Chinese army in Northern Jiangsu is launching attacks on Huaiyin and Shuyang, and has established contact with a certain unit advancing south from Koukou. Fighting continues in Huaihai, Funing, Yancheng, and Shaobo. Japanese troops are entrenched in Huaihai County, but are controlled by the main force of the Chinese army and have lost their ability to operate (Telegraph of the 15th).</p>
<p>A Certain Location: Anti-Japanese military affairs in Northern Jiangsu have recently entered a new stage. This is because the Kou army entered Suqian and the Kou army still occupies the area between Huaiyin and Shuyang, establishing contact. At the same time, the Kou Kou Kou army attacked the Japanese troops entrenched in Huai'an and Huaiyin. The Japanese troops, fearing their retreat route would be cut off, appeared panicked and urgently reinforced Yangshao. In addition, several dozen Japanese motorboats and three hundred Japanese soldiers were added to Shaobo. They attacked the flanks of the Chinese army from Shaobo Lake, causing the Chinese army to be attacked from both front and back. They were still able to divide their forces and fight a bloody battle with the Japanese army for a day and a night, fighting hard in the rain. The positions were destroyed by artillery fire and could not be defended. That night, they transferred their positions again to defend the Kou Kou Kou Kou Kou to Kou line. On the morning of the 11th, fierce fighting continued. In the Funing area, the Chinese and Japanese armies are still in stalemate in the Huangyang River, Zhongxin, and Gan areas. Although there has been fierce fighting for days, there have been no major changes. The Chinese army's position there has stabilized. After Bin was recovered, the Chinese army continued to advance. Currently, the Kou army, in order to strengthen its command, has divided Northern Jiangsu into several guerrilla war zones, dispersing its troops. In the future, they will establish war records with each other, restrain the Japanese army, and cooperate closely with the Kou Kou armies. The future of the war situation will inevitably have new developments (Telegraph of the 15th).</p>

<h3 id="e10">The Tragedy of Czechoslovakia <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>This year is a year of tragedies for the world. In Europe, the tragedy of Spain has not yet ended, and the tragedy of Czechoslovakia has replayed. According to dispatches from various locations in recent days, the Slovak province and Carpathian Ruthenia province within Czechoslovakia have already declared independence. Many disturbances have also occurred in the Czech heartland. President Hácha has already gone to Berlin with Foreign Minister Chvalkovský, who advocates unconditional surrender to Germany, to meet with Hitler. At the same time, Germany, Hungary, and Poland have each deployed heavy troops on the Czechoslovak border, and German troops have already forcibly occupied several important towns in the Moravian province of Czechoslovakia, sharpening their knives to carry out the work of dismemberment. Under these grave circumstances of internal and external attacks, the fate of the Czechoslovak Republic is likely to suffer a truly tragic outcome.</p>
<p>The reasons for this misfortune of Czechoslovakia are, on the one hand, of course, due to Czechoslovakia's past tolerance and retreat, bringing it upon itself. In last year's Sudetenland issue, if Czechoslovakia had held the determination to "prefer jade to be broken," the result might not have been the outbreak of war. Even if war had occurred, it might not have suffered a fate like today. At the same time, democratic countries such as Britain and France must also bear a portion of the responsibility. Britain and France, in order to appease Europe, pressured Czechoslovakia to succumb to Germany, and stated in the Munich Agreement that Czechoslovakia's borders should be guaranteed by Britain and France. Now that Czechoslovakia's borders are being invaded by Germany, Hungary, and Poland, why haven't Britain and France come out to intervene? If Britain and France claim that certain clauses in the Munich Agreement have not yet been implemented, so this clause cannot take effect, this is clearly an evasive argument with ulterior motives.</p>
<p>The true intention of Britain and France's unwillingness to interfere in the Czechoslovak question may be that in relation to the colonial and Mediterranean questions recently brewing between Germany and Italy, Britain and France intend to take advantage of Germany's eastward advance to temporarily alleviate these two problems, and hope that by showing good intentions by not interfering in the Czechoslovak question, Germany and Italy will reduce their demands on these two problems. However, in fact, this attempt by Britain and France is inevitably equivalent to a fantasy. This is clear from the fact that when Carpathian Ruthenia declared independence, it even telegraphed Hitler and Mussolini, requesting protection from Germany and Italy. However, according to general observations, the German government may follow the requests of Hungary and Poland and cede Carpathian Ruthenia to Hungary, so that the territories of Hungary and Poland can be contiguous. This act of Germany's being generous at others' expense does not represent genuine goodwill towards Hungary and Poland, because its purpose is to gain the sympathy of Hungary and Poland for the colonial and Mediterranean questions of the German-Italian axis. Britain and France originally intended to sacrifice Czechoslovakia to reduce the loss of their own interests, but the result was that they were used by Germany as a force to pressure Britain and France. How could this have been within their expectations?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Czechoslovak question is not the key to the Central European question. The Czechoslovak question may be brought to a close in the near future, but the whole of Central Europe will definitely not stop other questions from arising as a result. Take Ukraine as an example. The majority of Ukraine's land is under the control of the Soviet Union. Carpathian Ruthenia in Czechoslovakia is only a part of it. Ukraine is a place extremely rich in agricultural products and minerals. Germany regards Ukraine as the second Sudetenland, and has long wanted to use Carpathian Ruthenia as a base to invade Greater Ukraine. If this time Germany is really willing to give Carpathian Ruthenia to Hungary, in reality it is probably only a "temporary goodwill." When Germany deems it necessary, it will probably not be difficult to take it back from Hungary's hands.</p>
<p>Moreover, the fascist ambitions of aggression will never be satisfied. Germany's eastward advance is by no means limited to Czechoslovakia alone. The countries currently aiding and abetting its actions, such as Hungary and Poland, are all its targets. If the aggressor considers there to be an appropriate opportunity, it will use the so-called freedom of the Greater Germanic nation and incite the independence of minority nationalities to launch attacks on Central European countries at any time. Like the anti-German movement that occurred in Poland not long ago, if Germany needed to launch an aggression against Poland, it would have taken that as an excuse long ago. In order to prevent the eastward expansion of fascist forces, Poland once attempted to unite Central European countries to establish a neutral group, a "third axis." Now, the countries of Central Europe have gone against this aim. Not only are they not uniting and cooperating together, but they are instead carrying out aggression against their neighbors. If Czechoslovakia unfortunately collapses, will Hungary and Poland, with the loss of lips protecting the teeth, be able to resist fascism with their individual strength? From then on, the position of the small countries of Central Europe will become even more dangerous.</p>
<p>Therefore, this tragedy of Czechoslovakia is another profound lesson for the democratic countries of Britain and France, to make them recognize that the arrogance of fascist countries is high and difficult to stop, and has almost become an ironclad fact, both in Europe and, I'm afraid, in the Far East. With international credibility having gone bankrupt to this extent, will democratic countries such as Britain and France sit idly by and allow the forces of power to run rampant? Or will they find a way to conclude some agreement, sacrificing the weak to seek temporary compromise? Or will they fundamentally use force to maintain the justice and fairness of the world and protect the remaining interests of democratic countries? Now is the last juncture. If a plan for active protection is not set down, I'm afraid there will come a day when they will regret it!</p>
<h3 id="e11">Ministry of Finance Second Local Financial Conference Declaration <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Economic mobilization is a necessary condition for winning victory. Control of economic centers in war zones and consolidation of economic barriers are the goals of our efforts, as instructed by the supreme leader.</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Ministry of Finance's second local financial conference concluded on the 10th. It is understood that the conference formulated a comprehensive plan for strengthening the organization of local financial institutions, expanding their business, and assisting in production, in order to adapt to the current situation of the war of resistance and seek close cooperation between the central and local governments. After detailed discussions, the results were satisfactory. The conference declaration is recorded below:</p>
<p>Conference Declaration: At the beginning of the second phase of the War of Resistance, transportation in various places is relatively difficult. We bear the responsibility for local economic and financial affairs. After receiving the call-up order from the Ministry of Finance, we have come to Chongqing from far and near, braving dangers, to gather and discuss plans to increase production, promote exports, balance prices, provide food, and develop resources. Furthermore, we have studied how to link and cooperate with each other in wartime finance and economy, in order to mobilize the overall financial strength of our country and use the entire economic power of our people to smash the enemy's conspiracy to blockade our economy and destroy our finances, so as to achieve the goal of winning the War of Resistance and building the nation. We deeply feel the importance of the mission and the arduousness of the responsibility. In addition to returning to our respective provinces and cities to earnestly implement all the agreed-upon plans, we also make the following declaration to announce to our compatriots at home and abroad: First, we firmly believe that economic mobilization is a key element in determining the outcome of modern warfare, and the sound organization and adjusted promotion of financial institutions are the foundation for strengthening the economy and striving for victory. In the past, under the guidance and maintenance of our financial authorities over the years, local financial institutions in various provinces have established a solid foundation and gradual development. However, in this era of total War of Resistance, we have carefully examined each other and feel that there are still many areas that need to be improved or assisted. For example, in the war zone, how to resist the use of enemy and puppet banknotes, how to prevent materials from being used by the enemy, and in areas outside the war zone, how to stabilize prices, how to develop production, and how to make the gold and silver scattered and hidden by the people all exchanged for legal tender. Only these few problems have not yet been satisfactorily resolved, which proves that those of us in the financial and economic circles still have unfulfilled responsibilities. Therefore, we sincerely hope that after this conference, we will return to our respective positions and in the second stage of the War of Resistance, we will make full use of the financial strength of various places to promote the economic development of various places, so that they can stand on different positions and strive towards the common goal of the central government, that is, to concentrate the scattered economic forces of various places and create a great and substantial overall power to promote the success of the central government's various financial, economic, and economic policies, and not to be ashamed of the mission that all industries should bear in the great era. Second, we deeply know that the prosperity and decline of financial undertakings are entirely related. In the past, local financial industries may have only considered the interests of one province and one bank, and did not pay attention to the overall situation, so that the national financial and economic policies have not been fully implemented. After this conference, under the unified guidance of our financial authorities, we deeply know that if the country does not exist, where can the province exist? If the province does not exist, where can the bank exist? Therefore, everyone should unanimously follow the entire policy of the country and promote the entire economy of the nation, and there should be closer cooperation between the province and the central government, between provinces, and between the province and the county and township, sincere and seamless cooperation, to overcome all difficulties and work together. Third, we believe that there is a saying in the art of war that attacking the mind is the best strategy. If we want to win an economic victory in the enemy's rear, the key lies in controlling the economic centers in the war zone and consolidating the economic barriers in the war zone. Therefore, we must prevent the enemy from establishing an economic foundation and controlling finance within the war zone. The basic condition is that we must enable our compatriots in the war zone to obtain economic or financial convenience from us in their respective industries, so that the materials in the war zone can be absorbed as much as possible and supplied for our exports, and the needs of the people can be fully supplied, so that the national economy and people's livelihood can benefit at the same time. In the future, we must use all possible methods in this regard, and work together to make the enemy's dream of blockading our economy completely ineffective. Fourth, we unanimously believe that the supreme leader's instruction that "the enemy's blockade of our economy is an opportunity for our economic recovery" is the basic principle of national economic revival and should be the goal we strive to adhere to. In the past, due to the backwardness of industrial production in our country, many needs had to rely on imports of foreign goods for supply. In order to seek the convenience of supply, it was gradually regarded as a matter of course and became the only source of supply, which not only resulted in huge leakages but also greatly affected the development of domestic industrial production. Considering the principle of national self-sufficiency in modern nation-building, this is a major shortcoming. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, our country's seaports were blockaded by the enemy, and economic relations were on the verge of being severed. Through this stimulation, we can realize that relying on imports is not a long-term solution. We must find ways to solve our own needs. Although imports are blockaded, we can still find ways out of no way. For example, during the European War, Germany was unable to import saltpeter due to the blockade of its seaports, so it could not obtain the dilute gas necessary for manufacturing gunpowder. After painstaking research, it finally invented a method of extracting dilute gas from the air. We believe that with the vastness of our country's land and the breadth of its resources, if we can concentrate the minds and willpower of the whole country and painstakingly research and invent, it should not be difficult to achieve self-sufficiency and establish the foundation of ethnic industry. As for transportation, although the railways and highways near the war zone in our country have been destroyed and occupied by the enemy, the transportation in our northwest and southwest is developing rapidly, and with the richness of our country's manpower and animal power, such as old-fashioned carts and boats, horses, and other transportation methods, with new reorganization and equipment, can also produce considerable effects in assisting transportation. Therefore, the enemy's blockade policy is giving us an opportunity to transform the economy and revive the economy, and is a stimulant for us to promote production and construction and strive for self-sufficiency. We should further gather our strength and work tirelessly to make the inland economy divide and cooperate in the shortest possible time and revive rapidly, so that agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce can have a sufficient supply of funds to improve their operations, so that each part of the production can achieve the greatest prosperity and the fastest increase under the economic conditions and economic environment that are most suitable for our current situation, so as to achieve the result of many difficulties and different countries. Regarding local finance, the Ministry of Finance paid special attention to it at the beginning of the War of Resistance. The first local financial conference held in Hankou last summer announced a summary of methods to improve local financial institutions. Later, at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, various plans were passed, such as measures to regulate local finance and measures to deal with finance and economy in the war zone. At the Third National Political Council, the proposals of the councilors on economy and finance also had various resolutions. We are willing to sincerely follow and work together. Although the number of programs agreed upon at this financial conference is not very large, the substance contained in them is greatly related to the people's livelihood and national economy and the foundation of economic recovery, and we will seek further concrete implementation in the paths indicated by the aforementioned programs. The creation of each program has been the result of our greatest efforts, and the earnest guidance and great loyalty of the financial authorities have made us admire them infinitely. In addition, the supreme leader came to give instructions amidst the busy military affairs, and his earnest instructions moved us deeply and convinced us wholeheartedly. All the main points instructed by our supreme leader and the principles guided by our Executive Yuan President and financial authorities will be the common goal of our individual efforts. We sincerely hope that the amount of future results will be the measure of our repayment to the country. One more thing that excites us is that when participating in the conference, we were pleased to hear that the United Kingdom has further cooperated with our country and established a foreign exchange fund of 10 million pounds. This move is of considerable benefit to the establishment of our country's finance, but what we should especially strive for is that the cooperation of friendly countries is based on the goodwill of friendly countries on the one hand, and on the other hand depends on whether our country can become self-reliant. In the past, the cultivation and planting under the guidance of our Executive Yuan President and the efforts of the financial authorities have increased our country's status and reputation in the international community, and friendly countries have faith in our country's finance and are happy to provide assistance. In the future, if the local financial institutions in our provinces can do their best and uphold their responsibilities, and work together under the instructions of the central government, then the cooperation of friendly countries will surely be more, and our economic recovery will be faster. Therefore, the conference sincerely expresses its lofty admiration for the success of the Executive Yuan President and the financial authorities, and encourages our colleagues to continue their efforts in the future, in order to jointly complete the mission of the great era, and to live up to the earnest expectations of our supreme leader. This is the declaration. (Reported on the 15th)</p>

<p>(London) Regarding the "Provisional Government" in North China implementing exchange management measures, it is learned that the British, French, and American ambassadors to Japan lodged a protest with the Japanese government on the 3rd of this month. (Havas telegram on the 15th)</p>
<p>(London) British Under-Secretary Butler stated in a written reply in the Lower House that the British Consul-General in Tianjin questioned the Japanese authorities about the unfavorable plans adopted by the Japanese side for the British Concession, but has not yet received a reply. However, the Acting British Consul-General met with the Japanese commander on March 6 to review the entire situation. The Japanese commander agreed to discuss the matter with the Japanese Consul-General so that the Japanese Consul-General could reply. Butler also said that he knew that the American and French ambassadors had also negotiated with the Japanese government. A member asked what action the British government had taken regarding the implementation of the new currency regulations by the Japanese in North China. The Under-Secretary replied that appropriate negotiations were being conducted with the Japanese government, but he was unable to give details at this time. Reuter's learned that the dispatches submitted by the United Kingdom, France, and the United States to Japan regarding the currency and other commercial restrictions in North China were all very strongly worded. Since the first day of the implementation of the new regulations, trade has been completely suspended, and many Japanese merchants have also admitted the inconvenience of this situation. Official reports on the impact of this matter have not yet arrived, but it is generally believed that the Japanese military authorities who strongly enforced these new regulations will have to abandon their claims sooner or later.

<p>(Moscow) The 18th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party concluded its discussions on Stalin's report on the work of the Central Committee, Vladimirsky's report on the work of the Supervisory Committee, and Manuilsky's report on the work of the Soviet Communist Party delegation to the Executive Committee of the Communist International on the morning of the 14th. Thirty-seven representatives from major party departments spoke, all advocating for the approval of the Central Committee's political direction and practical work under Stalin's leadership, and supporting the cleansing movement against Trotskyist and Bukharinist saboteurs, spies, and fifth columnists within the Party and government organs. When discussing Stalin's report, the representatives especially enthusiastically supported the Party and government's foreign policy. After the discussion of Stalin's analysis of the international situation and the principles of Soviet foreign policy he put forward, representative Shcherbakov moved that the congress pass the following resolution: "The 18th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, after listening to and discussing Stalin's report on the work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, resolves: First, to approve the political direction and practical work of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party; Second, to approve Stalin's report and instruct all party departments to implement their work in accordance with the principles and tasks put forward in Stalin's report." After Shcherbakov's motion, the congress immediately responded with prolonged and enthusiastic applause, expressing support for Stalin and the Central Committee, the united solidarity of the entire party in supporting the leader, and the victory of Stalinist policies. Shcherbakov's resolution was unanimously passed by the congress. At the same time, the work of the Supervisory Committee and the Soviet Communist Party delegation to the Executive Committee of the Communist International was also approved by the congress. (TASS dispatch on the 14th) (Moscow) People's Commissar of Defense Voroshilov delivered a speech at the 18th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"In the past five years, the Red Army and Navy have undergone massive, and in some cases fundamental, transformations in terms of organization, armament, technical equipment, and military training. The main points are as follows: In the past, we all knew that the Red Army infantry, mainly, and other units, to a lesser extent, were based on the mixed principle of both regional and standing forces. This regional system meant that our infantry divisions had to expand from a small and weak cadre at the time of mobilization. This system was also small compared to the armies of capitalist countries, and it could barely be used in wartime when expanding from the original weak cadre. However, as the major imperialist countries began to increase their military strength and could take action at any time in peacetime, it no longer met the needs of national defense.</p>
<p>"As you all know, we have built fortified areas in the zones most vulnerable to attack on the border in the past. During this period, we have tried to further strengthen these fortresses and build other fortress belts to fundamentally reverse the entire border defense organization. At the same time, the strength of the special troops in the fortified areas has also increased.</p>
<p>"Due to the increase in the number of troops, the improvement of equipment, and the growing cultural and political demands of the soldiers, we believe that it is necessary to adopt the political commissar system.</p>
<p>In addition, a year ago, the Party Central Committee and the government established a Supreme Military Council of eleven people, one of whom was Stalin. The responsibilities of this council include the review and resolution of all basic and most important issues in the establishment of the Red Army. Military councils have also been established in each military district. Finally, during this period, the Navy was separated from the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and is under the jurisdiction of a specially established People's Commissariat for the Navy.</p>
<p>"The increase in the number of Red Army personnel during this period is as follows: If the number at the 17th Congress was 100%, then we can say that it has increased by 103% at the 18th Congress. This increase is not the same for all types of troops, but is distributed according to their respective importance. We now have ten times more standing infantry units than when we adopted the regional system. At the same time, the number of personnel per division in wartime has increased from 13,000 to 18,000. This increase in strength is mainly in the artillery units, from the so-called mortar units to the artillery divisions, and the increase in machine gun units. The number of soldiers per company has also increased. Now the Red Army infantry corps of 60,000 men is equipped with an appropriate number of cannons, tanks, and other weapons.</p>
<p>"The firepower of a French infantry corps of three divisions, with all artillery, is 6.373 kilograms per volley. The German equivalent is 6.078 kilograms. Our country's is 7.136 kilograms. The French corps can fire 51.462 kilograms of shells per minute, the German 48.769 kilograms, while our country reaches 66.605 kilograms (applause). If we add the weight of landmines, rifle grenades, and bullets to the weight of shells fired per minute, the firepower per minute for each French corps is 60.981 kilograms, the German 59.509, and our country's is 78.932 kilograms. These figures prove that the firepower of our infantry corps, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, is not only no less than that of capitalist and fascist countries, but exceeds it. I will not cite the figures for the Japanese, Polish, and other countries' armies, although I also have them, because the organization and equipment of our divisions and corps are far superior to those of Germany and France.</p>
<p>"The Party Central Committee, the government, Stalin, the entire Party, and the entire people demand that our national defense capabilities not lag behind those of neighboring countries. You can now see that we are not lagging behind, and we have no right to lag behind. Our cavalry strength has increased by 52%, and its technical equipment has been strengthened as follows: light machine guns by 30%, heavy machine guns by 21%, anti-aircraft machine guns by 31%, and artillery by 43%. The personnel of our tank and armored vehicle units have increased by 152.50%, the total number of tanks has increased by 191%, and the total number of armored vehicles has also increased by 7.5 times. There have been extremely important adjustments in the equipment of the tank units (especially the artillery of these units). If in 1934, each shell of all artillery on armored vehicles and tanks was equal to 100, then in 1939 it had increased to 393. Also, if in 1934 the firepower on the tanks was equal to 100 per minute, then in 1939 it had increased to 3340.</p>
<p>As for our artillery equipment, we pay special attention to it. The work in this area has achieved satisfactory results. During this period, light artillery has increased by 34%, medium artillery by 26%, heavy artillery by 85%, and anti-aircraft artillery by 169%. As for the tank guns and anti-tank guns that we felt were lacking, the increase in their numbers even exceeded that of other types of artillery, and in terms of quality, they are indeed first-class. Previously, we had no so-called mortars. At present, we have manufactured this important artillery (mortars and grenade launchers), and have achieved good results in both quality and quantity. The quantity of artillery has increased, and there has been great progress in terms of quality and types. The range of artillery has also been enhanced. For example, the range of various heavy artillery has been enhanced by 50% to 75%. As for the rate of fire, it has also been enhanced, especially for tank guns (enhanced by 100%). The weight and explosive power of shells have also been increased. The Red Army's chemical defense troops, whose job is to defend against enemy poison gas attacks and return the same poison gas to the enemy, have undergone organizational adjustments, and their strength is twice as strong as before. As for our signal corps, it has also been enhanced by 37%, and they have made good progress in technology and equipment. We have paid great attention to air defense, but we must admit that air defense equipment is not yet perfect. However, at present, we can see the rapid progress of air defense equipment in the major cities of the country. The total number of anti-aircraft artillery has increased by 288.3%, and the firing range height of anti-aircraft artillery has also increased by 60% (cheers). With the cooperation of anti-aircraft artillery and fighter planes, a tight air defense network has been formed in the most important cities of the country. At the same time, the total number of fighter planes has increased by 142.3%. As for flight personnel, the current total number has increased by 138% compared to 1934. In terms of horsepower, the current number has increased by 213% compared to 1934, or 7.9 million horsepower. The total number of aircraft has increased by 130%.</p>
<p>Our air force has increased in quantity and made significant progress in quality. For example, the speed of fighter planes has increased by 565%, and their altitude has increased by 21.5%. The speed of short-range bombers has increased by 88%, their altitude has increased by 83%, and their long-range has increased by 50%. As for long-range heavy bombers, their speed has increased by 70%, their altitude has increased by 77%, and their long-range has increased by 61%. Also, for reconnaissance planes and fighter planes, their speed has increased by 67%, their altitude has increased by 23%, and their long-range has increased by 45%.</p>
<p>There have also been changes in proportions. For example, the proportion of heavy bombers has increased from 10.6% to 20.6%, and the proportion of fighter planes has increased from 12.3% to 30%. In other words, our air force is even stronger, and its attack power has also been enhanced.</p>
<p>In 1934, the entire air force of our country could carry 2,000 tons of bombs in one flight, but the current capacity has increased by 208%. If the enemy dares to invade Soviet territory, these bombs can be used as a "straitjacket for these lunatics" to restrain their mad behavior. Assuming that in 1934 the machine gun firepower of our air force was 100 per second, then in 1939 it had increased to 300.</p>
<p>Currently, in our military airfields, fighter planes and bombers are everywhere. Their speed has exceeded 500 kilometers per hour, and their altitude is between 14,000 feet and 15,000 feet. As for the long-range of our aircraft, there are facts that have been demonstrated to the world. For example, the Soviet heroes Chkalov, Gromov, Baidukov, Tomashev, Belyakov, Danilin, Kokkinaki, the late Brandys, and the female aviator Grizodubova, etc., are all outstanding talents.</p>
<p>I have not mentioned the Navy. This is not because it belongs to another People's Commissariat. In fact, it is because the Party and the government have decided to build a strong navy. This construction work is proceeding at full speed. Since 1934, the mechanical traction used by the troops has increased by 260%. In 1934, each Red Army personnel had 7.74 horsepower of this mechanical traction. In 1939, it had increased by 167%, that is, increased to 13 horsepower. At the same time, the strength of the Red Army has doubled. Cadres decide everything. There is absolutely no question about this. This is also why the Central Committee of the Party and the government are working so hard to find true Soviet military cadres. These cadres must have high military responsibility and fight for the great ideals of the country and Lenin-Stalin.</p>
<p>Whether in terms of quality or quantity, the cadres of five people are excellent. When the Red Army was carrying out the cleansing of despicable elements, the fascist and imperialist aggressors shouted that the cadres and military strength of the Red Army had been weakened. No one except the fascist aggressors paid attention to this rumor. A certain country, because it lost its spies active in the Red Army, actually believed this rumor. Therefore, in order to "take advantage" of this "excellent opportunity," the country launched an attack on Lake Khasan. The results of the Battle of Lake Khasan are well known. With the help of the Red Army, the officers and political workers of the First Special Red Banner Army have clearly informed the aggressors who participated in this piratical adventure of the true combat power of the Soviet army and the efficiency of the military commanders and political personnel.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that all those who have designs on the Soviet Union and all those who believe that the strength of the Red Army has been reduced can take warning from this. If they think that the lessons they have learned are not enough, then our Red Army is ready to give them even more painful lessons at any time.</p>
<p>The following figures demonstrate the increase in the number of our cadres in the past five years: infantry officers (including artillery) increased by 118%, cavalry increased by 66%, artillery vehicles, armored vehicles, and tank teams increased by 154%, artillery increased by 124.5%, air vehicles including engineering technology and service personnel increased by 148%, pilots increased by 184%, and aviation engineers increased by 801%. The Red Army is not only a school for hundreds of thousands of Soviet citizens to learn tactics and fight the enemy in peacetime, but also a school for all officers and soldiers to learn political knowledge and Marxism-Leninism. We have a network of schools for training officers and military specialists. There are 63 army schools, with tens of thousands of young people studying. Thousands of lieutenants graduate every year, all with good military and political training, loyal to the Party of Lenin-Stalin. There are 32 aviation schools, with more than 20,000 students, all sent by the Party and the Communist Youth League.</p>
<p>The number of students in various schools has increased in the past five years as follows: army schools increased by 117.8%, military and political schools increased by 273.3%, and air force increased by 187%. The Red Army has 14 military academies and six special military research classes at universities, training commanders, political instructors, engineers, and doctors, etc. There are more than 20,000 students enrolled. In addition, there are about 15,000 officers who are studying in evening research classes and correspondence classes. There are also six-month and two-year junior military schools and training class officers. Every year, the Red Army selects tens of thousands of soldiers to enroll. Providing sufficient officer talent in wartime is one of the most difficult problems for all capitalist countries. We do not have this problem. We have largely solved the problem of replenishing officers in wartime. The material living standards of our soldiers are very high, and the lives of officers have also changed greatly in the past five years. The salaries of all officers and instructors have increased by an average of 286%.</p>
<p>The funding for cultural undertakings in the Red Army has increased greatly, which has greatly improved the cultural level of all officers and soldiers. For example, in 1934, our army had 15,009 Lenin "corners," and in 1939 it increased to 26,435. In 1934, there were 1,336 clubs, and now there are 1,900. In 1934, there were 142 Red Army palaces, and now there are 267.</p>
<p>The Red Army library now has a collection of 25 million books. Red Army members subscribe to 1,725,000 newspapers and read 471,000 magazines every day. In 1934, the funding for cultural education was 72 million rubles, and now it is 230 million.</p>
<p>Voroshilov continued to discuss the work of the Aviation Chemical Defense Association and other organizations in strengthening national defense, and the tasks of the Red Army's political commissars and political instructors, saying that the foundation of the Red Army's life and training is the same as that of the entire people, and it is the doctrine of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The Red Army has special political organs. In addition to the Party and the Communist Youth League, the responsibility of this political organ is to constantly improve the government awareness of all soldiers and officers. The role of the Red Army political commissar is very important in this regard. He is the most responsible person in the army. The commander and the political commissar form a common unit, guiding the military and political education and training of the army. The two are jointly responsible in military, political, moral, economic, logistical, and other aspects. During the 17th and 18th Congresses, the army's political organs made great progress. On January 1, 1934, there were 15,600 political workers, and now there are 34,000, an increase of 126%. In the work of cleansing spies and traitors in the army and the political organs themselves, the status of the staff of various political organs and political commissars has also increased a lot. In recent years, the Red Army's political personnel have been greatly replaced, and thousands of young, loyal, and outstanding party members have been promoted from lower levels to responsible positions. The tactical and shooting training of the infantry, on the horizontal line, although the organization of this type of troop is now more complicated in all aspects, the cavalry can also coordinate its own training with the training of its mechanization equipment. In wartime, the Red Army cavalry will be able to perform a high level of military art. The same is true for the artillery. There has been progress in military and tactical training. All kinds of artillery teams, artillery officers, and political commissars can undertake any military task. The tank soldiers are also good at shooting and can handle everything. The air force has excellent cadres, and its special and tactical training is also good.</p>
<p>Everything mentioned above has been proven by actual testing many times. The enemy also admits the good training of the Red Army. As I said, they have miscalculated our strength and vainly hoped to seize our territory. (TASS dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia: The city is currently still stable, but filled with a tragic atmosphere. Mechanized German troops are now entering the city from all directions. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia: This morning, the first batch of German troops entered Prague and paraded for an hour. Mechanized units entered one after another. The main administrative organs in the city, such as the Ministry of Defense and the General Post Office, were immediately occupied. Czechs and Germans gathered to watch the German troops enter the city, with occasional instances of disobedience to police commands, but no serious disturbances. Two people were knocked down by German military vehicles. The shouts of Czechs cursing were mixed with the cheers of Germans. When German armored vehicles passed by, some Czechs sang the Czech national anthem. The entire territory of Bohemia and Moravia is now under the control of German troops, but the number of occupying troops is not large. The relationship between the Czech military police and the German army has not yet resulted in conflict. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German troops have occupied Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia. The city is no longer the capital of the Czechoslovak Republic, but the capital of a German protectorate. German troops are still allowing Czech officers to carry weapons. German police are also entering the city with the army to take over the city's police affairs in the occupied areas. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia: German troops' guns and cannons were unloaded at the Prague railway station this morning at 8:00 AM. Their armored vehicles have also arrived there. German troops are about to occupy the city hall. When German troops stepped out of the station, the platform was crowded with German civilians. (Haitong dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German army has begun occupying Czech territory since last night. Most cities were taken over by German motorized units this morning. Another eight battalions of infantry were transported by a large number of planes over the capital of Czechoslovakia, and then landed on the ground by parachute. Czech army units have been ordered by the German army authorities to concentrate in designated locations, waiting to be disarmed. All junior and middle-ranking officers are not allowed to wear uniforms from today. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The President of Czechoslovakia, Hácha, held talks with Führer Hitler at the Prime Minister's Office at 1:10 AM this morning, lasting 45 minutes. After consultations with Foreign Minister Chvalkovsky and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in his office, he held a second round of talks with Führer Hitler. He finally signed a final agreement at 3:55 AM this morning, agreeing to entrust the fate of the Czech people to Führer Hitler. According to general interpretation, the areas where the Czech people live, namely the two provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, will become German dependencies. Although they will enjoy considerable autonomy in administration, it is difficult to expect them to retain a national army, let alone pursue an independent foreign policy. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The President of Czechoslovakia, Hácha, and Foreign Minister Chvalkovsky, held talks with Führer Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop from 1:10 AM until 3:55 AM, when they ended. An official communique was then issued, stating that "both sides declared that they were willing to ensure peace in Central Europe. President Hácha then declared that, for the sake of thoroughly pacifying the situation, he has decided, with full confidence, to entrust the fate of the Czech people and their country to Führer Hitler, which has been accepted by the Führer, who declared his decision to place the Czech nation under German protection, allowing it to maintain its autonomous system so that it can fully develop its personality." (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia: The Prime Minister of the Central Government, Beran, recently declared that Führer Hitler had told President Hácha that, for the sake of Germany's security, it was necessary to occupy the two provinces of Bohemia and Moravia. Therefore, the German army will enter our country at 6:00 AM this morning. "Our country has no choice but to accept German orders, so we have no choice but to announce to the people of the whole country that President Hácha has entrusted the fate of the Czech nation to Führer Hitler. According to the results of the cabinet meeting, it was generally believed that since Czechoslovakia had no possibility of resistance, it had no choice but to submit. The action of President Hácha was immediately approved unanimously. Regarding this issue, well-informed sources here said that Führer Hitler decided to demand the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia after meeting with Aviation Minister General Göring. General Göring is said to have advised the Führer that if a war were to break out in Europe in the future, Germany would find it difficult to spare a large number of troops to monitor Czechoslovakia, so it would be better to strike first. In this way, the Czech army will be disarmed one after another as the German army advances." (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain explained the British government's attitude towards the Central European situation in the House of Commons today, saying that the British government had recently tried to reach a compromise with other signatories to the Munich Agreement, but had not succeeded. Therefore, Britain's guarantee obligations no longer have the effect of binding the signatory countries. He cannot believe that what Germany is doing now is what any signatory to the Munich Agreement intended. Germany's occupation of a country with which it has no racial ties is a first, and this move will certainly be a cause of disruption in the international situation. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

French Foreign Minister Bonnet will also meet with German Ambassador Welczeck this afternoon, when the ambassador will present a note stating that Germany's actions in Czechoslovakia were fully agreed to by the Czech government. In addition, Foreign Minister Bonnet will also attend the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies to explain that Britain and France were originally supposed to protect the borders of Czechoslovakia in accordance with the Munich Agreement, but because certain conditions were not met, this guarantee could not take effect. In this instance, the Czech government did not appeal to the British and French governments. (Havas, 15th)</p>

According to well-informed sources, if the Czechoslovakian province of Carpathian Ruthenia is incorporated into Hungary, then the Romanian minority-populated areas of the province should be ceded to Romania in exchange for that country's understanding. As for the Polish government's attitude, apart from strengthening its defenses in the areas bordering Czechoslovakian Carpathian Ruthenia, it has taken no other action. Reports that Polish troops have entered Carpathian Ruthenia are denied by officials here. This country has no territorial ambitions towards Czechoslovakia. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>Berlin: According to reliable sources here, after the German army occupied Bohemia and Moravia, they will be incorporated into Germany and the Nazi swastika flag will be adopted. Jews in the area will be treated the same as Jews in Germany proper. While administrative and cultural affairs in the area may enjoy autonomy within the scope of National Socialism, the establishment of an independent state is no longer under consideration because Czechoslovakia no longer exists. In addition, Slovakia has already formed an independent state, and it should be recognized and diplomatic envoys should be sent to Bratislava, the capital of the state. There are many Germans in the state (Germans account for 30% of the population of Bratislava). This issue "should be resolved with reference to the state's interests." Although the authorities in Carpathian Ruthenia have requested assistance, the German authorities did not consider it, because the issue of Carpathian Ruthenia should be resolved by Hungary and Germany is not interested. Now that Czechoslovakia has ceased to exist, the Vienna Arbitration Award on the demarcation of the borders between Hungary and Czechoslovakia has become a dead letter. Hungary is naturally no longer bound by it and has the freedom to act. (Havas, 15th)</p>

(Havas News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>Czech Capital: The central government has decided to accept the ultimatum presented by the Hungarian government, withdraw Czech troops from Carpathian Ruthenia, and has instructed General Prchala, Minister of Interior and Finance of the autonomous province, to take all necessary measures to handle the withdrawal. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital: The ultimatum presented by the government to the Czech central government includes four demands: (1) all Hungarians previously arrested by the Czech authorities should be released immediately; (2) Hungarians should no longer be mistreated; (3) Hungarian self-defense groups should have the right to be armed; and (4) Czech troops should withdraw from Carpathian Ruthenia. According to well-informed sources, the Czech government's response did not satisfy the third demand.

<p>(Berlin) An official announcement this afternoon stated that Hitler took a special train to Bohemia and Moravia at 8:00 this morning to meet with the German army. (Haitong, 15th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Führer Hitler issued a proclamation to the nation (broadcast to the entire country by Propaganda Minister Goebbels): "Germany, months ago, seeing that the German minority in Czechoslovakia was suffering intolerable mistreatment, had no choice but to provide protection. However, in recent weeks, similar incidents have repeatedly occurred in Czechoslovakia, causing the various nationalities of the country to declare independence. Czechoslovakia can no longer survive. Especially since the 12th of this month, the various minorities in Czechoslovakia, unable to bear the oppression, have appealed to Germany for help, with letters and telegrams pouring in. At the same time, German refugees, carrying boxes and suitcases, have been fleeing into Germany in a continuous stream, suffering displacement and misery. The fate of Czechoslovakia has a close relationship with the survival of Germany, and it has been under German rule for over a thousand years. Now, the country is in a state of terror and turmoil, and if this continues to spread, order will inevitably collapse. In order to avert the crisis and create a new order, I have decided to send troops to Bohemia and Moravia to eliminate the terrorists and disarm the Czech troops who are protecting terrorist activities, and to protect the lives and property of those who have been threatened. In the future, we will create the necessary environment with reference to the historical scale and the actual needs of the German and Czech peoples in order to find a fundamental solution." (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Führer Hitler issued a proclamation to the army, stating, "Czechoslovakia has collapsed. The German residents of Bohemia and Moravia have suffered intolerable mistreatment. I have ordered our troops to enter these provinces today in order to protect the lives and property of the people. I hope that all officers and soldiers will not treat the residents of the occupied areas with hostility, but will be mindful that their mission is to represent Germany and be responsible for establishing a new order. If anyone in the area offers resistance, all officers and soldiers must give them a head-on blow. In short, all officers and soldiers entering Czechoslovakia must not disgrace the mission of Greater Germany." (Havas, 15th)</p>

<p>(Vienna) After the Slovakian Province Assembly of Czechoslovakia declared the province an independent state today, Prime Minister Tiso immediately sent a telegram to German Führer Hitler requesting assistance, stating, "The Slovak people have now broken away from Czech shackles and declared independence, constituting a new factor for the pacification of Central Europe. I am honored to inform Your Excellency in the name of the Slovak people. The independent state of Slovakia is willing to live in peace with all neighboring countries and promote mutual relations. Your Excellency, as the leader of the new Germany, has always been sympathetic to the struggle for freedom and the right to national self-determination of minorities. I, as the Prime Minister of the independent state of Slovakia, hereby request Your Excellency to provide immediate assistance to our country." (Havas, 14th)</p>

Although the authorities have ordered flags to be flown to celebrate, most shops have not complied. Armed soldiers patrol all the thoroughfares, and the atmosphere is tense. The cabinet of the new independent state held its first cabinet meeting at 4:00 PM today, which ended at 7:00 PM. While the meeting was in progress, 800 students marched to the Prime Minister's Office to swear allegiance to Prime Minister Tiso. Prime Minister Tiso immediately left the meeting for a moment, personally met with them, and delivered a speech. In addition, the cadres of the Slovak Autonomous Party appointed Sano Mach (the current Propaganda Director of the independent state government) as the leader of the party's defense force today. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Khust: The Carpathian Ruthenian Parliament formally declared independence at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon and immediately formed a new cabinet. The list of cabinet members is as follows: Prime Minister Voloshyn (the original prime minister), Foreign Minister Levytsky (the original secretary), Finance Minister Palasko-Gugol (newly appointed), Defense Minister Klugulak (newly appointed), Public Health Minister Dulinna (newly appointed), Interior Minister Perevnyk (newly appointed).

<p>(Washington) The Star reports that the collapse of Czechoslovakia has caused a painful impression here. This new crisis is a prelude to an even more serious crisis that will occur before the end of this month. According to intelligence from American diplomats in Central Europe, the German and Italian governments are now preparing to make a real show of force. Many people have warned the US government that turmoil will break out within ten days. Officials in Washington believe that today's developments in Europe are clear evidence that the various dictatorships want all other small democratic countries to obey their command in the future war against Britain and France. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The political circles here are deeply impressed by the sudden turn for the worse in the Central European situation. Diplomatic sources have declared that Führer Hitler's proclamation to the nation said that Czechoslovakia's existence was essential to Germany and that it had been under German rule for over a thousand years. On this basis, the racial principles espoused by Führer Hitler in his book "Mein Kampf" have now been discarded, and his statement after the Munich Agreement last year that National Socialism did not want to annex foreign people to Germany was merely empty words.

<h3 id="e30">Japanese Army Actively Building Defenses on Hainan Island, Attempting to Occupy It Permanently; Japanese Generals Hold Meeting on Ship to Discuss Measures to Deal with Chinese Guerrillas <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Guangxi Correspondence: The Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island is a blow to Britain and France in the Far East and a warning to the United States to pay attention to the Far Eastern issue. The Japanese side has determined that the loans from Britain and the United States to China are a manifestation of intentional economic oppression, so it is expanding its southward policy at all costs, arming Hainan, and establishing a naval combat base on the Pacific coast in preparation for triggering a world war. Five days ago, Japanese commanders such as Okawa and Ando gathered on a warship anchored in Haikou and convened a meeting of senior generals to discuss the southward invasion plan. After this meeting, the Japanese command released information that it had assembled a large number of ground troops, moving southward from Taiwan and coordinating with the naval and air forces, preparing to invade Guangxi along the West River route, and for a time, the military situation on the West River on the southern route was shrouded in a tense atmosphere. In fact, the meeting in Haikou mainly discussed two issues: (1) to hold the existing strongholds in the East, West, and North Rivers and Hainan, organize "mopping-up teams" to deal with Chinese guerrillas, attempt to eliminate them, and strictly seal off the coastal ports; (2) to transfer more troops to penetrate the Guilin-Liuzhou area of Guangxi, cut off the southwest international transportation line, break the southwest anti-Japanese war center of gravity of the Chinese side, and promote the realization of peace. According to the latter point of view, if the Japanese army wants to occupy the southern route, it must extend its forces to Guizhou Province. Otherwise, the southward invasion plan will inevitably be shattered. However, if the Japanese army wants to advance westward to Guizhou, the wider the battle line, the greater the force it must use, and it will not be successful without increasing its force by hundreds of thousands of troops. However, in the current international environment, can the Japanese army try to devote its national strength to compete with the southwest of the Chinese side? This is indeed a big question. After the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, in view of the fact that the deeper it goes, the more difficult it becomes, it has decided not to make excessive sacrifices and consumption in its southern invasion strategy in order to damage its national strength. Since it is unwilling to sacrifice and consume, it will undoubtedly not dare to go deep into Guilin. Therefore, the results of the meeting only determined the first step of its progress. The entire invasion of the southwest still needs to be decided by the highest military command of the Japanese army. According to news from the highest military intelligence agency in southwest China, after the Japanese army occupied Hainan Island, as of March 10, a total of two brigades of ground troops, numbering about 15,000 men, had been transported to the island and stationed in the five strongholds of Haikou, Qiongshan, Wenchang, Chengmai, and Ding'an. There may be subsequent dispatches, and Yulin, Sanya, Qinglan, Pupu, and ports around the island are occupied by naval landing forces, completely blockading all the ports of the island, restricting the free entry and exit of large and small boats in the ports, and preventing fishing boats from going to sea for fishing. The traffic on the whole island is completely cut off. Recently, more than 20 engineers and technicians from a certain country and a large number of machines were transported to Haikou to be unloaded. It is said that they are preparing to build a large-scale naval port and carry out a five-year warship construction plan at the same time. Such active actions are actually attempts to occupy Hainan for a long time to deal with the democratic countries of Britain, the United States, and France. Chairman Chiang said that the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan is no less than the September 18 Incident in the Pacific, which is not wrong. At present, the Japanese army is taking active military action in Hainan. Regardless of its intentions and the results of future evolution, the Chinese side has also been actively planning to deal with it recently. It is said that the central government has recently increased the dispatch of many divisions of the latest mechanized troops to the territory of Guizhou, and distributed them to the rear defense lines of Guilin, Liuzhou, and Yongzhou to strengthen the anti-Japanese war forces. The troops originally stationed in various parts of Guizhou Province are all transferred to eastern or southern Guizhou, and are stationed on the border between Guizhou and Guangdong, forming a unified whole with the front-line troops on the Southern Road and West River, setting up defenses at every turn, and being extremely strict. The defense affairs of the Guizhou-Guangdong border are as solid as a golden soup.</p>
<h3 id="e31">The Japanese Puppet Army Hold Different Dreams: Guangzhou is Already a Dead City, Japanese Forces Seize Silver and Gold, Counterfeit Currency Abounds, and the People Have No Means of Livelihood <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Dispatch: Since Guangzhou fell, although the Japanese army has worked hard to use a policy of appeasement to restore prosperity to the urban area, after all, contradictions abound. On the one hand, they hypocritically lure citizens to return to the city, but soon after, they credulously believe reports that citizens are guerrillas and arbitrarily arrest and kill them. On the one hand, they use the puppet municipal chamber of commerce to summon merchants to resume business, and on the other hand, they allow vagrants to occupy shops, like a cuckoo laying eggs in a magpie's nest. All kinds of deceitful facts are difficult to hide from citizens with reason. Therefore, citizens who were deceived and rushed back to the city, without exception, flee the urban area again. According to a friend who escaped from Guangzhou again, the current Guangzhou puppet authorities are helpless in terms of finance. After Guangzhou was ravaged by the Japanese, the entire social economy went bankrupt. None of the formal large stores in the city have resumed business, only food stores and vendors have opened. In order to raise funds, the puppet authorities have so-called "collar fee," "flag fee," "protection fee," and other names, exhausting all the resources. Unfortunately, the survivors after the catastrophe have exhausted their wealth, and their daily rations are insufficient, so how can they supply it? The young and strong have no choice but to take risks, while the old and weak die in ditches. Since the puppet authorities cannot extract money, they are increasingly worried. Therefore, they resorted to using counterfeit currency policies. Since the military tickets issued previously could not be used, they forged five-yuan banknotes of the Central Bank and transported them to Guangdong for use. The paper of these counterfeit banknotes is loose and fragile, the paper texture is blurred, the watermark is not as clear as genuine banknotes, the Zhongshan portrait is crudely colored, and the characters on the left and right lack water ripples. When this kind of counterfeit currency was first issued, some citizens misused it by mistake, but later the flaws gradually became apparent, and citizens warned each other to resist counterfeit money. The Japanese army found it difficult to sell with deception, so they changed their plan to seize silver in the countryside. Gradually, the gold and silver existing in Guangzhou were also looted, and transported back to the three islands by merchant ships for the purpose of casting machinery. In Guangzhou, the Japanese army's government came from multiple sources. The urban area is invisibly divided into naval defense areas, army defense areas, and gendarmerie defense areas. The central area of Guangzhou is the sphere of influence of the Japanese gendarmerie and the puppet police. The northeastern suburbs are the forbidden area of the Japanese army. The Haizhu Bridge and the important passes along the river are the exclusive area of the Japanese navy. Citizens who vainly seek protection, having obtained the navy flag, find it ineffective once they enter the army's defense area. If there are items approved by the army, they are again obstructed when they arrive at the navy's defense area. Within the Japanese army, there are also several factions. The puppet Northeast Army and the Korean Army under the Japanese army's banner often secretly express sympathy for the Chinese people. Although the Taiwanese puppet army are in cahoots with the Japanese navy, they only know how to plunder and have no intention of dying for the Japanese army. Their combat effectiveness is very weak. The Japanese military officers know this, but they intend to use them and dare not strictly control them, to prevent any rebellion from affecting the whole situation. Therefore, the Japanese military officers feign deafness to the rape and killing committed by their subordinates. The decay of their military discipline increases the people's hatred. For this reason, the Japanese army has recently found that the guerrillas in various districts of Guangzhou are unusually active and difficult to defend against. Therefore, they have established so-called "mopping-up teams" in an attempt to use guerrillas to control guerrillas, but in reality, they have not achieved any results. Wherever the mopping-up teams go, only civilians suffer, creating opportunities for the Japanese and puppet troops to plunder and rape. Therefore, only guerrillas attack the mopping-up teams, and the mopping-up teams have never encountered guerrillas in ten operations. What the mopping-up teams have wiped out are all good people who are unable to escape, which is fundamentally contrary to the original purpose of using guerrillas to control guerrillas. Their military efficiency is actually equal to zero.</p>

<p>Guiyang Special Dispatch: In order to develop transportation in the southwest, the Ministry of Communications, in addition to having started construction on the Sichuan-Yunnan and Yunnan-Burma railways, is also preparing to build the Yunnan-Guizhou railway. It will start from Kunming, pass through Songming, Malong, Qujing, Luliang, Shizong, and Luoping to the Guizhou border, pass through Xingyi, Anlong, Zhenfeng, Guanling, Anshun, and Qingzhen, and reach Guiyang. The surveying work started in May of the year before last and was completed by the end of January of this year. The surveying method was divided into two teams. The first team started from Kunming, worked for 462 days, and surveyed a total of 685 kilometers of main line, comparison line, and guide line, averaging 1.480 kilometers per day. The second team started from Guiyang, worked for 210 days, and surveyed a total of 242 kilometers of main line, comparison line, and guide line, averaging 1.150 kilometers per day. The slope in Yunnan is below 1.5%, and the slope in Guizhou is below 2.5%. The total cost of surveying the entire line is 110,000 national currency. The start date will be implemented after the Sichuan-Yunnan railway is completed.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Notes on Inspecting the Western Border: Climbing Mountains and Crossing Ridges to Arrive at Kangding, Passing Lengzhuguan, the Situation is Dangerous, Transportation Needs to Be Developed Urgently, and Opium Use on the Border Needs to Be Eradicated <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Kangding Correspondence: Pengba used to be the Hualin Camp of the Jianchang Circuit. Before Luding County was established, it was under the jurisdiction of the local chieftain. In the first year of the Republic of China, Luding County was established, and the chieftain obeyed the Han officials, no different from ordinary people. The Pengba Town has a joint security director's office. The streets in the town are narrow, and the market is deserted. There are only hotels and small inns, most of which are dirty and unbearable. The reporter and a group of more than 20 people traveling with him stayed in various small inns. At 7:00 am on the 25th, we set off westward. Along the way, the cliffs were towering and the strange peaks were towering. Walking on the steep rocks, my heart swayed and I dared not look down. Short walls are built on the side of the rocks to protect against pedestrians from slipping and falling. It can be seen that the road builders in those years put in a lot of effort.</p>
<p>Deep into the Wilderness: After walking ten miles, we arrived at Lengzhuguan. The mountains are stacked upon mountains, the smog is hazy, the strange rocks are jagged, and the mountain road is even more dangerous. It has already penetrated deep into the wilderness. The pass is uniquely steep, and the mountains are sandwiched together. The natural danger is extremely steep, giving the impression that one man can hold the pass, and ten thousand men cannot pass. In the valleys, there are many cacti, the large ones are old trees, reaching a height of ten feet. Below the mountain gorge is the lower reaches of the Dadu River. The steep banks are secluded and gully, and a stream of water flows through it. The thunder rumbles like galloping horses. The turbulent waves surge, and the chaotic rocks lie on the dangerous beach. The snow waves pour straight down, and the waterfalls are like cloth, wailing endlessly day and night. Behind the pass is a black pool, which is unfathomable. The locals say that there is a demon in the pool. Every noon, people from Kangding or Wasigou hire Yutong lamas to chant scriptures. After chanting, they throw dough figures into the pool to worship it, saying that if they don't do this, the demon will cause trouble and there will be a drought or strong wind. In recent years, Yutong has often suffered from drought and wind disasters, and people blame the lamas for not throwing the dough figures. Further ahead, the mountains are covered with snow. There are many evergreen trees under the mountains. After passing Wasigou, the beach is dangerous and the water is rapid, like thunder. Sometimes waterfalls pour down the mountains, like white silk hanging in the air. Smoke rises from the mountain recesses, and the houses are sparse and countable.</p>
<p>Arriving at Kangding: After walking fifteen miles west from Wasigou, passing the first water source on the Dahe River, we arrived at Rishi, where there are more than 30 residents. The place produces medicinal materials such as Qianghuo, musk, and rhubarb. There are scenic spots such as Tianshan Bridge and Lama Spring. Nearby Huashan is covered with snow all year round, and stone bamboo shoots pierce the clouds, making it a spectacular sight. From here westward, many Chinese and Tibetan slogans can be seen along the way. The announcements issued by the government are also a combination of Chinese and Tibetan. In the Yutong area, girls carrying rice are often seen on the mountain roads. Most of them are between the ages of fifteen and sixteen. Their hard work and endurance are beyond comparison with the modern women in inland cities. Fifteen miles west, we arrived at Liuyang, which has only seven residents and produces cordyceps and fritillaria. When we reached Shenghang, we had entered Kangding County. There is a Lion Rock across the river, shaped like a strange lion. Behind the mountain is a hot spring, which is warm in winter and cool in summer. The most famous local products are deer antler, snow ganoderma, and snow lotus. From here westward, the stone path is rugged, and the sedan bearers are more and more tired. The reporter got off and walked on foot. At this time, the evening mist was low and the twilight smoke was rising. On the way, I saw a woodcutter crossing the river on a single-rope bridge, which was frightening. Along the hillside, there are many ruins, which shows the cold and hardship of the ancient post. After passing Caiyuanzi, it was almost dusk. Before long, I saw electric lights flashing in the distance, and Luchang was in sight. At 5 o'clock, I entered the East Gate, which was already lit up with thousands of lights. That evening, I stayed at a friend's house, and the seven-day journey from Ya'an to Kangding came to an end.</p>
<p>Thoughts on This Trip: From Chengdu to Kangding, the journey is more than 800 Chinese miles. Except for taking a car from Chengdu to Ya'an on the same day, Ya'an to Kangding is 540 Chinese miles. In the middle are towering mountains, undulating ridges, rugged mountain roads, and the great rivers are separated. When crossing the Xiangling and Flying Leap Ridge, it takes almost two days to walk in the ice and snow, because the mountains are high and the slopes are steep, and sedan chairs cannot be carried up. Traveling to this point is also called hard work. This time, the reporter entered Kangding, climbing mountains and crossing ridges all the way, walking dangerously and enduring the cold. Although it was a long journey and I experienced hardships, I went deep into the wilderness and saw the scenery of the border, which was also gratifying. The mountain journey was originally eight stations, but because I continued on my way after passing Hualinping, I shortened the journey by one day. During the Ya'an-Kangding journey, I traveled for seven days, and what I saw and heard was not without feelings. (1) The roads I passed were all high mountains and ridges, sheep intestines and crow paths, and the dangers were extraordinary. With such difficult transportation, no matter from the perspective of national defense or economy, accelerating the completion of the transportation line plan is a fundamental and urgent task. The Sichuan-Kang highway should also be actively rushed to be completed and opened to traffic as soon as possible to facilitate travel. (2) Kangdong is all mountains, sparsely populated, and the land that has been reclaimed is less than one percent. However, the climate is not particularly cold, and ordinary grains can be grown. If the geographical advantages are not developed, it is no wonder that the people are poor. In the future, the authorities should make efforts to promote the reclamation of wasteland and increase production. (3) Everyone knows the harm of opium. In the stations I passed, opium dens were lined up, and the poisonous atmosphere permeated. As soon as I got off the horse, I smelled the fragrance, and I could enjoy myself everywhere. The people are ignorant and addicted to opium. They are stubborn and pitiful to fall. The reporter saw a man named Qiu raising a monkey that was also addicted to opium. The owner fed it three or four bubbles of opium every day, otherwise it would cry and sneeze non-stop. Monkeys are like this, so how can people bear it? I deeply hope that the authorities will completely ban the opium disaster and prevent it from poisoning the border. (4) Border education has always been backward. There are many illiterate people in each county, so there is really no culture to speak of. There are few schools, and the sound of strings and songs is rarely heard. All foreign ideas, academics, and modern culture cannot be instilled. In the future, it is even more urgent to popularize education, enlighten the people, strengthen the spirit of resistance against Japan, and save the country. If the above can be realized one by one in the shortest possible time, it will not only contribute to construction, but also greatly help national defense. Kangdong's development may have a chance.

<h3 id="e34">Fujian Province Plans to Organize Immigration and Reclamation, Demarcating Ten Counties in the Northwest, Such as Chong'an, with Central and Provincial Governments Jointly Allocating Large Sums of Money for Management <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Fujian Province is bordered by the sea in the southeast, and most of the people are engaged in fishing. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War the year before last, the sea has been blockaded by Japanese warships. Every time they go to sea, they are repeatedly killed, resulting in complete unemployment and running out of food. Fishermen in various places such as Otter Cave and Chongwu in Huian County, and Puxi and Pinghai in Putian County are all in a state of starvation. The disaster is extremely serious. Although the government has sent personnel to provide relief, it is not a fundamental solution. Since the reorganization of the Provincial Relief Association, it has been working hard to find relief methods for the livelihood of coastal fishermen. A Refugee Production Undertakings Management Office was specially established, with Standing Committee member Zhou Yi'e concurrently serving as the director. It is divided into two parts: agricultural reclamation and handicrafts. The agricultural reclamation part is responsible for planning by Wang Naijie, and the handicraft part is responsible for planning by Bao Kehong. It is planned to move the people who have been harassed in the coastal areas to various counties in northwestern Fujian on a large scale. Young and strong people with working ability will be ordered to engage in cultivation. Women will be ordered to enter factories to spin and weave. Old and weak people who are unable to work will be ordered to enter relief homes or sent to charitable organizations for adoption. Children will be sent to reformatories. The resettlement locations have been determined as Qingliu, Chong'an, Ningyang, Taining, Dehua, Yong'an, Jianyang, Shaowu, Jiangle, Shunchang, Mingxi, Datian, and other counties, and Chong'an is designated as the center of reclamation in northern Fujian, and Dehua is designated as the center of reclamation in western Fujian. Each county will set up a reclamation office. The director of the office will be concurrently held by the county magistrate, and the deputy director will be dispatched by the Provincial Relief Association. When the settlers depart, they will be issued travel expenses, food expenses, and accommodation expenses, all of which will be supplied by the government. After arriving, each person will be issued 18 yuan for six months of food expenses, 15 yuan for house repair expenses per household, 12 yuan for fertilizer expenses, 10 yuan for seed expenses, and 10 yuan for pocket money. One head of cattle will be issued for every three households, and 10 yuan will be issued for the purchase of plows and harrows. The estimated total cost is 1.5 million yuan. The Central Relief Committee will allocate 1.1 million yuan of relief bonds, and the Provincial Relief Association will use 400,000 yuan of additional land reclamation funds from the two tax bureaus in Zhuqi and Shuikou in the province. The Provincial Relief Association has recently appointed committee member Zhang Naiwu to go to various counties in southern Fujian, such as Fuqing, Putian, Huian, Jinjiang, Tong'an, and Haicheng, to inspect the living conditions of fishermen and discuss immigration methods with the local county governments in order to begin work.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Foreign Ships Sailing to Fujian: Japan Actually Plans to Conduct Registration, Quanzhou is Repeatedly Bombed <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency, Gulangyu, 9th Dispatch: It is recently reported that the Japanese Navy has become more active in the Xiamen area and has been deliberately provoking trouble since Friday and Saturday of last week, causing communication between Gulangyu and the inland of Fujian to be cut off again. The beginning of this matter is due to the Japanese Navy's proposal that all foreign merchant ships transporting goods to the inland of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou must register with the Japanese Navy in Xiamen in advance. This news was conveyed by foreign sailors who came from Zhangzhou. Some refugees who came to Gulangyu from Quanzhou for refuge said that Japanese planes bombed the city on Friday and Saturday of last week, dropping heavy bombs. One bomb fell in Zhongshan Park, where the Youth Volunteer Army was training, and several people were killed. Another bomb hit the Chinese government office. Japanese planes circled and inspected the skies over Quanzhou for days, seemingly taking some action. Also, foreign ships sailing to Quanzhou telegraphed to Gulangyu on the 8th of this month, saying that Japanese planes were bombing everywhere in Quanzhou and could not enter the port to unload goods. In the future, trade between Gulangyu and the inland of Fujian may become a dead market due to the activity of Japanese planes and the insistence of the Japanese army in Xiamen on registration.</p>
<h3 id="e36">In the Miserable Wind and Rain of Ganpu and Huangwan: The Japanese Army Rapes and Abuses Everywhere <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Yuanhua Correspondence: Since the Japanese army launched a large-scale attack from Jiaxing, Xiashi, and Haining on the seventh day of the Lunar New Year in Ganpu, Huangwan, and other places, the guerrillas fought and retreated. The Japanese army immediately attacked Yuanhua and Haiyan, and went straight to Ganpu, Huangwan, and other places, where they stationed troops to block the Chinese army from crossing the sea from Ningbo and Shaoxing to form a pincer movement with the Japanese army in Pudong, attempting to wipe out the guerrillas. They set up electric wires on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway and sent troops to search various villages and towns every day. Wherever they went, it was truly a scene of chaos. Farmers were not allowed to work in the fields. Those who were found working were shot to death, fearing that they were guerrillas. Women were robbed and raped. Those who refused were killed. They extorted women from the villagers. When they could not get women, they threatened the men with guns, knives, or burning their houses, forcing them to hand over the women before stopping. Those who were strong resisted, while those who were timid gave up their women for them to trample on. Even eighty-year-old women and twelve-year-old girls were not spared. There are many wealthy merchants in Ganpu. Redwood furniture and other furniture in the houses were mostly transported to Shanghai and Hangzhou by the Japanese army via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. Women in the city who did not have time to escape were mostly raped by the Japanese army. Under the pretext of checking the population, they frequently broke into people's homes to search for women and plunder property. They took off their leather shoes, put on straw sandals, so that people were not prepared. At night, they often knocked on doors, shouting and entering, or several soldiers climbed in with their shoulders, knocking on the door to lead other soldiers in to commit adultery. In the rural farmhouses, one soldier was stationed in each house, and two soldiers were stationed in the more well-off houses, much like the method of the Mongols occupying China in the Yuan Dynasty. After entering, they did whatever they wanted, and their suffering is unspeakable. Once, a Japanese soldier broke into a civilian's house in Yuanhua, and a woman was so shocked that she died. Because the Japanese army did not allow farmers to work and shops were closed, the price of rice was only about ten yuan per dan, but now it is seventeen or eight yuan. The people in Yuanhua, Huangwan, and Ganpu are suffering unspeakable misery. Furthermore, there are traitors who act as accomplices, which is truly intolerable. The Japanese army forced the local people to repair the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway and the roads in the surrounding areas to facilitate the movement of troops. Men and women were not spared, and they were forced to work. If they did not do as they were told, knives and guns were used, and blood was spilled. Women were also insulted from time to time. Furthermore, because people in various places were scattered and fleeing, they issued notices ordering them to return home to report. If they did not return by the deadline, their houses and property would be confiscated or burned. As a result, there are more and more refugees.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Central and Provincial Governments Allocate Funds to Manage Linhai Water Conservancy <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Can Increase 200,000 Mu of Paddy Fields, Settle Refugees, and Increase Production: Jinhua Correspondence: Since Zhejiang Province became a war zone, food is scarce and the number of refugees has increased sharply. The provincial government believes that the most urgent task at present is to find ways to settle refugees and develop production. Recently, the proposals from various parties are to reclaim barren mountains and manage inland farmland water conservancy, but the work is difficult and costly, and the results are limited. The original emergency measures are far less effective than carrying out the water conservancy project in the Taozhu area of Linhai. The total area of farmland to be managed in the area reaches 200,000 mu. The soil is fertile and was originally good farmland for planting rice. However, due to the lack of water conservancy, the waterways are circuitous and silted up. When it rains, it becomes a swamp, and when it is slightly dry, it becomes a disaster. Disaster-stricken land accounts for almost three-quarters of the total area, and refugees are everywhere. Most of them become pirates, disturbing the local area, which is not a small matter. In the spring of the 26th year, the Construction Department sent technician Yang Jian to investigate. In the 27th year, an design surveying team was organized to conduct surveying and design, and a project plan was drafted, which was considered to be detailed. Compared with other land reclamation undertakings, it has the following advantages: (1) Most of the land in the area was originally fertile farmland. Once it is managed, it can be cultivated. It is not like the sea mud in other places, which must be desalinated for six or seven years before it can be used. (2) The cost of the project in the area is not very high when allocated per mu. After the management, the benefited farmland reaches 200,000 mu, which is the only way to increase production and settle refugees. (3) The area has been suffering from disasters for many years. The original farmers have either changed their careers to fishing or become bandits. In order to stabilize people's hearts and turn bandits into farmers, it is necessary to carry out the water conservancy and land reclamation project. (4) Similar water conservancy and land reclamation projects in the vicinity, such as Xianyan, Sanmen Bay, and the coastal tidal flats in Huangyan, Wenling, Ninghai, and other counties, have yet to be managed, and the area cannot be counted. The 400,000 yuan of project funds allocated by the central and provincial governments this time will be used as a permanent fund. After the project in the area is completed, it can be recovered from the benefited farmland and transferred to the above-mentioned places for water conservancy loans. If this is done gradually and managed properly, it is possible to increase the cultivated area by millions of mu. Its contribution to relieving disaster victims and increasing production is immeasurable. In this long-term war of resistance, the water conservancy project is not only sufficient to benefit the local area, but also an important task to settle refugees and stabilize the rear. It should be implemented in time to promote relief.</p>

<p>Taixian Correspondence: The war situation in northern Jiangsu has been improving in recent days. The Japanese army, which retreated from near Baoying to Pingqiao, forty li away from Huai'an, has been retreating towards the vicinity of Huai'an and Qingjiangpu after the New Fourth Army continued to bravely counterattack. Although the Japanese army has tried to harass Fuyang and Yancheng again, the New Fourth Army is prepared, and it is difficult for the Japanese army to succeed.</p>
<p>Xinghua Correspondence: Shanggang Town, which belongs to Yancheng County, was attacked by two gray Japanese bombers at about 3 pm on the 7th. They flew from the northwest to the skies over the town and dropped several bombs, all of which fell in the river embankment fields and did not explode. Also, at about 10 am on the 6th, four Japanese planes flew to Yancheng and dropped five bombs, all of which fell outside the city, destroying several reed sheds, killing one person, and causing no other losses.</p>

<p>—Rice Price Has Tended to Fall in Recent Days—</p>
<p>Seven groups, including the Bean and Rice Industry Association, organized the Grain Evaluation Committee to stabilize rice prices. It was formally announced yesterday, and the first committee meeting was held. As goods gradually arrived in the market, the rice price has tended to fall. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Declaration of Establishment: The Grain Evaluation Committee, jointly organized by seven groups, including the Amaranth Rice Industry, Rice Shop Industry, Rice Milling Industry, Dealer Industry, Changshu Guild Hall, Nanbang Guild Hall, and Yunmi Merchants Lianyi Association, held an establishment meeting at 3 pm yesterday on the fourth floor of the Shanghai Business Building, Silk Industry Building, Hankou Road. Representatives from the seven groups, including Zhang Nianxuan, Chen Ziyi, Fu Qiangeng, Jiang Shizhi, Zhou Zhizhen, Shi Hongxun, Pan Jibin, Huang Ruyuan, Zhu Zhaoqi, Cai Yukun, Zhu Zixiang, Lu Wenshao, and Yan Jiyun, were present. Cai Yukun was elected as the temporary chairman, and he reported on the purpose of the meeting and the necessity of establishing the Evaluation Committee. Then, the regulations were revised and formally announced.</p>
<p>Important Cases Discussed and Decided: Then, the first committee meeting was held. (1) Regarding the evaluation of the recent rice price, it was decided that high-quality white japonica rice would be 14 yuan per dan, and the price of medium-quality and inferior rice would be determined separately. (2) Regarding the investigation of rice reserves, it was decided that members would be sent to investigate the total amount of grain stored in various warehouses in the two concessions, starting today, for reference. (3) Regarding the internal affairs of the committee, it was proposed that the Bean and Rice Industry Association handle the matter, and it was decided to pass it. The administrative expenses will be borne by the participating committee members at 10 yuan per month.</p>
<p>Regulations Passed: Regulations of the Shanghai Rice Industry Group Evaluation Committee: (1) This committee is jointly organized by various rice industry groups in Shanghai and is named the Shanghai Rice Industry Group Evaluation Committee. (2) The purpose of this committee is to distinguish rice varieties and evaluate rice prices in order to stabilize them. (3) The committee will have 15 members. The Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Rice Shop Industry Association will each nominate five members. The Grain Dealer Industry Association, the Shanghai Northern Yunmi Merchants Lianyi Association, the Rice Milling Industry Association, the Changshu Guild Hall, and the Nanbang Guild Hall will each nominate one member. (4) This committee will not hold regular meetings. When deemed necessary, the Bean and Rice Industry Association may convene a meeting at any time. (5) The address of this committee will be temporarily set at No. 15 Aiduya Road. The meeting place will be determined temporarily. (6) This committee will evaluate prices at any time based on the price limits set by the Bean and Rice Industry Association. The price of medium-quality and inferior rice will be determined separately. (7) The rice prices evaluated by this committee should be reported to the authorities of the two concessions at any time and submitted to the Market Management Committee for announcement. (8) Once the rice price falls and is deemed unnecessary, this committee may dissolve itself. (9) The organizational reasons, regulations, and list of committee members of this committee should be reported to the City Chamber of Commerce and the authorities of the two concessions. (10) If there are any matters not covered in these regulations, they may be amended at any time with the consent of a majority of the members of this committee.</p>
<p>Market Announcement: According to the regulations of the Evaluation Committee, the rice price evaluated by the Evaluation Committee will be announced to the market in addition to reporting to the authorities of the two concessions. According to the Xinsheng News Agency reporter, the Market Management Committee has learned that in order to make all the firms and merchants in the city understand the establishment process of the Evaluation Committee and announce the rice price evaluated yesterday, Fu Qiangeng and others will convene a temporary committee meeting of the Market Management Committee this morning to report everything in detail and continue to persuade vendors to actively purchase in order to dredge the source.</p>
<p>Rice Price Stabilizes: Since the Bean and Rice Industry Association and others successively decided to implement price limits and persuaded vendors to resume transportation, the weather has turned sunny in recent days, the number of rice boats arriving in Shanghai has increased, and the rice supply has been balanced. Large households have also stopped absorbing, and hoarders are selling off one after another. The rice price in the market has tended to stabilize. Yesterday's market price has fallen by six or seven corners to two or three corners, so the food problem in this city can be considered solved.</p>
<h3 id="e40">The Puppet Regime Controls Foreign Exchange and Prohibits Legal Tender; Britain and America Both Protest <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Domestic remittances in North China and Shanghai are limited to legal tender, but legal tender is still fully usable in all areas.</p>
<p>Following the puppet "North China Provisional Government's" control of foreign exchange, prohibition of legal tender, and forced implementation of the "Lianquan" [United Reserve Bank notes], affecting the commerce of various countries in North China, Britain, the United States, France, and other countries have lodged protests. Legal tender is still fully usable in various parts of North China, and domestic remittances between Shanghai and North China are limited to legal tender. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Legal Tender Fully Circulating in North China After the puppet "North China United Reserve Bank" issued banknotes, it forced the devaluation of legal tender in North China and prohibited its use in Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, Yantai, Taiyuan, Shanhaiguan, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Linfen, Xinxiang, and other places. However, in reality, legal tender continues to circulate as usual in all of the above places, and its value is even higher than that of the "Lianquan." The people's faith in legal tender is growing stronger, and more and more people are hoarding it. Although they dare not refuse to use "Lianquan" due to the forced environment, they accept and pay with it as needed. The amount of "Lianquan" in circulation is 185 million yuan, while the amount of legal tender in circulation is 335 million yuan.</p>
<p>Legal Tender Exchange between Shanghai and North China Shanghai banks are well prepared for the ban on legal tender in North China, so they are absolutely unaffected. The Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and various commercial banks continue to handle domestic remittances to various parts of North China, exchanging legal tender with each other. For example, remittances from Shanghai to Peiping can be collected in legal tender in Peiping. Shanghai banks uniformly refuse to accept "Lianquan," so remittances from North China to Shanghai are limited to legal tender. Although banks in North China are in a harsh environment, they continue to use legal tender as usual, as do foreign banks. If deposits are in legal tender, withdrawals are also paid in legal tender.</p>
<p>Various Countries Protest to Japan</p>
<p>In addition to prohibiting the use of legitimate legal tender, the puppet "North China Government" is also implementing foreign exchange controls. Britain, the United States, and France believe that this plan harms the interests of various countries and affects commerce in North China. Therefore, Britain, the United States, and France have protested to Japan one after another. After the war, shipping in North China has been monopolized by Japanese merchants. The import of Japanese goods and the export of local goods to Japan through North China's Tianjin, Jiaozhou, Yantai, Weihaiwei, Longkou, Qinhuangdao, and other ports are dominated by Japan. The trade of Britain, the United States, and other countries in North China has declined unprecedentedly. Local products such as cotton, soybeans, and leather are all controlled by Japan.</p>

<p>The Shanghai youth community has initiated the organization of the Shanghai Youth Spiritual Mobilization Association, which held its founding meeting the day before yesterday and established branches in major middle schools and vocational groups.

<h3 id="e42">Unsuccessful Attack on Nanhui; Japanese Troops Flee Zhuhqiao <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Nancheng is as solid as a rock and has not fallen; Japanese casualties are estimated at forty to fifty.</p>
<p>The Japanese troops from Chuansha who once invaded Nanhui County in Pudong were bravely repelled by the guerrillas and retreated to Zhuqiao. According to yesterday's report, the Japanese spokesperson's claim that the Japanese army had occupied Nancheng last Friday (the 10th) after a fierce battle with 1,000 Chinese irregular troops is not true. Nanhui city is still firmly defended by the guerrillas and remains intact. The fighting on that day was quite fierce. On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese army, along with the puppet "army" of Xu Hongfa, forced them to lead the way. About 300 Japanese-puppet mixed troops advanced south by land and water, crossing Si [character unclear] Cang. They opened fire with the guerrillas between Si [character unclear] Cangzhen and Nancheng, a distance of ten *li*. The Chinese army consisted of two battalions under Li and Yan, forming an arc-shaped skirmish line, using machine guns, grenades, and melee combat to press forward. After two hours, the special task force headquarters of Datuanzhen in southern Nancheng also rushed north to reinforce, engaging in fierce fighting several *li* outside Beidou. The Gu unit was originally a people's self-defense force from the coastal Nicheng, composed of trained young men, wearing gray uniforms and steel helmets, no different from regular troops. Last winter, they repelled the Japanese army in Nicheng and achieved remarkable feats. Although the Japanese troops fired small steel cannons at Nancheng from a distance, they could not reach the outskirts of the city. In the middle of the day, Zhang's guerrillas from Chuansha, east of Shangchuan Road, arrived in time to attack the rear of the Japanese troops in Zhuqiao, flanking the Chuansha-Zhuqiao railway line. As a result, the Japanese troops attacking the city wavered and completely retreated to Zhuqiao in the afternoon. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered about forty to fifty casualties. The guerrillas took advantage of the victory to advance, approaching Zhuqiao, and also recovered Sicang. Therefore, Nancheng is as solid as a rock and has absolutely not fallen. Zhang's troops on the Chuansha-Zhuqiao line continue to attack Zhuqiao every night, and the gunfire never ceases throughout the night.</p>
<h3 id="e43">"Dadao Police" Invade the Concession, Immediately Driven Out by British Troops <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Tolerates Japanese Actions; the U.S. Command's Attitude Turns Tough</p>
<p>According to the *Continental Daily*, at 8:15 PM yesterday (the 14th), an armed patrol team composed of "Dadao Police" was driven out of the boundary by British troops and Public Concession police near Bailinan Road and Yidingpan Road. The reason was that several "Dadao Police" were patrolling Bailinan Road when a British truck and a police car suddenly arrived near the "Dadao Police." British soldiers and Western police got out of the vehicles and lined up along the roadside. A senior British military officer spoke to the puppet police, ordering them to leave. After a brief conversation, the "Dadao Police" left Bailinan Road, passed through a nearby alley, and entered the Japanese-occupied area. According to sources, the "Dadao Police" did not linger after hearing the British officer's words and left immediately, and their attitude during the conversation was good. U.S. Marine Corps Commander Colonel Fagan recently protested the intrusion of plainclothes Japanese military police into the U.S. defense zone, making the actions of the British authorities yesterday even more significant. Although the Municipal Council claimed yesterday that Colonel Fagan had not formally protested the violation of the agreement between the Council and the Japanese authorities by the Japanese military police entering the Public Concession area, it is reported that the U.S. Marine Corps Command's feeling that the Council tolerates Japanese actions has become tougher. Although the Municipal Council issued a communiqué yesterday regarding the compromise, emphasizing the integrity of the police department in the Public Concession, it is known that plainclothes Japanese military police have repeatedly searched in the Public Concession without the permission of the Public Concession Police Department and have abducted at least twelve Chinese people.</p>

<p>According to the French-language *Shanghai Journal* on the 15th, the Dutch Minister to China, Mr. de Decker, left yesterday on the French mail ship *Aramis* to return to his country to report on his duties.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Bomb Explosion in Nanshi; Three Japanese Soldiers Killed <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese army actually used bombs as a ball game; a transport truck was destroyed and a driver was injured.</p>
<p>A bomb explosion occurred in Nanshi the day before yesterday, and yesterday's report differed slightly from the actual situation. The *She Wen She* [News Agency] has learned the truth as follows: On the morning of the day before yesterday (the 14th) at about 9:00 AM, a black bomb was suddenly found on the side of the road at the corner of Daji Road and Fangxie Road in Nanshi. At that time, three Japanese soldiers were patrolling and passed by. One of the Japanese soldiers saw the bomb and thought it was the remnants of a previously exploded shell, so he kicked the bomb into the center of the street and played a kicking game with the other two Japanese soldiers. At that moment, a transport truck sped west from the east of Fangxie Road. When it passed the intersection of Fangxie Road, the wheel rolled over the bomb, which exploded immediately with a loud bang that shook the surrounding area. The three patrolling Japanese soldiers were the first to bear the brunt and died instantly. The truck was also almost completely destroyed, and the Chinese driver's head and face were injured by shrapnel. Afterwards, the Japanese-puppet police in Nanshi were panicked because they did not know the truth. The Japanese immediately sent a team of Japanese soldiers to guard the surrounding area and conducted a large-scale search of residents, but found nothing. As a result, rumors spread yesterday that a landmine had exploded in the Public Sports Ground, which was actually a misinterpretation of this incident. As for the source of the bomb, it is said that it was placed in the corner of the wall by the Chinese guerrillas.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Eurasia Plane Missing; Tan Guang Safe <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Tan is currently in Hong Kong and was not on the plane.</p>
<p>After Eurasia Aviation's Junkers No. 23 large aircraft, flying from Chongqing to Kunming, went missing on the 12th of this month, the company has dispatched aircraft to search along the route. It is difficult to determine whether it crashed or landed midway. It was rumored that Tan Guang (Tan Zhonghui), the manager of the Hong Kong branch of the Central Bank, was also on board. Yesterday, a reporter from the *New Voice News Agency* obtained confirmation from the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank that Manager Tan is currently in Hong Kong and was not on the plane. The rumors are inaccurate.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Coins Prohibited in Occupied Areas <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Efforts to Collect Silver Dollars, Ornaments, and Valuables</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, since the implementation of the legal tender policy, has repeatedly issued orders to prohibit the use of coins. Recently, it has been found that in various occupied areas, a small number of people still have silver coins, which they were unable to take out at the beginning. As a result, they are even using these coins in the occupied areas. This not only violates government laws but also directly helps to undermine the national currency policy, affecting the promotion of legal tender and the future of the war of resistance. In order to effectively correct this, the Ministry of Finance has issued a circular to the finance departments of each province, ordering the commissioner's offices in each district to find ways to persuade the people in the occupied areas to follow government laws, prohibit the use of coins, and if they have any savings, the district offices should collect them in full legal tender, which will then be deposited in the bank. Other gold and silver ornaments can also be exchanged for legal tender at market prices, in order to comply with the law.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Outgoing Postal Workers' Departure Postponed <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The labor union made a request, and the headquarters is expected to accept it.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration recently received a telegram order from the headquarters to transfer 65 postal workers to serve in Guizhou, Guangxi, and Hunan provinces to sort out accumulated mail and improve work efficiency. After receiving the order, the Bureau selected 65 capable postal workers for external transfer and decided to depart on the 16th of this month (today). Some of the postal workers objected due to the meager treatment and difficult living conditions, and the departure date was rushed, so the issue of settling families in Shanghai could not be resolved. Therefore, the Postal Workers' Union repeatedly negotiated with the Bureau, requesting a postponement of the departure date and proposing five ways to improve treatment. According to union sources, the Bureau has expressed its sincere acceptance of the request and has telegraphed the headquarters for approval. As for the departure date, it has also agreed to postpone it for ten days. At the same time, the postal workers have decided to obey government orders and are willing to be transferred externally. Therefore, the transfer issue can be largely concluded.</p>

<p>The U.S. gunboat *Panay*, which was bombed and sunk by Japanese aircraft on the Yangtze River near Wuhu on December 12, 1937, resulting in deaths and injuries to U.S. Navy personnel, was the subject of negotiations between the U.S. and Japanese authorities, which resulted in compensation for the losses. It is now learned that the U.S. Navy authorities have submitted a proposal to the U.S. Congress in Washington, requesting that 21 Navy personnel on the *Panay* be commended. After discussion by Congress, it has been agreed to award medals or pay compensation. Other personnel from the U.S. Embassy who were on the *Panay* at the time of the bombing and sinking, such as Edgerton Backus and Stone Giss, as well as prominent U.S. journalists from New York, James [blank], and a reporter from the *Continental Daily*, will each receive compensation from Congress.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Japanese Warships Bomb Zhenhai; Only Two Innocent Civilians Injured; Three Japanese Warships Immediately Retreat <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Ningbo Correspondence: Three Japanese warships sailed to Zhenhai, moored outside the port at around 8:00 AM on the 14th, and then opened fire on the Jiangbei area of Zhenhai, firing a total of 63 shots. The outer customs house and civilian houses in the city were slightly damaged, and two innocent civilians were injured. The Japanese warships retreated immediately after firing, and our defending troops calmly prepared to pay, without retaliating. Damage from Zhenhai Bombardment Extremely Light Ningbo Zhenhai Port has been harassed by Japanese warships several times before, but because the local fortress is strong and the defenses are solid, the Japanese attempt has not been successful. According to shipping industry sources, the day before yesterday (the 14th) at around 8:25 AM, three more Japanese warships sailed to Zhenhai Port, moored off Likang, and then opened fire on Zhaobao Mountain and the Zhenhai urban area, firing a total of more than 50 shots. The Chinese garrison calmly responded and did not retaliate. The Japanese warships did not dare to go deeper and sailed away at around 9:00 AM. After investigation, only one shot hit the top of Zhaobao Mountain, some civilian houses were destroyed, a corner of the Zhenhai Port Customs House was destroyed, and several shots fell in the urban area, but they did not explode, so the damage was extremely light.</p>
<p>Dinghai Also Bombed by Japanese Warships A visitor from Dinghai said that at 3:30 PM on the 11th, two Japanese gunboats sailed from Zhushanmen outside the county's Dajietou River and, after circling around Wukuihou for a week, opened fire on the Dongyue Temple area, firing five shots in total. One shot each landed on the right side of the main hall, the east end of the rear hall's gallery, the open space outside the temple, and next to the wall on the right side. Only the eaves of the hall and a small portion of the foundation of the wall were damaged, and there was no other loss. It seems that the Japanese warships intended to harass the rear, but the people of Dinghai are quite calm, and the Japanese attempt is difficult to succeed.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Ships Sail as Usual It is also learned from a reporter from the *Modern News Agency* that since Zhenhai was harassed by Japanese warships again, the damage was minimal because most of the shots landed in desolate areas. Currently, order in Ningbo and Zhenhai remains as peaceful as usual. The general public has become accustomed to the indiscriminate firing of Japanese warships and does not pay attention to it, so the public is very stable. The Yi Shang Deping, De Shang Hana, Pu Shang Santai, Mei Shang Tangsai, Ying Shang New Beijing, and other ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo line are all sailing as usual, and shipping has not been hindered in any way. However, because most of the local products of Ningbo have recently been purchased by the Trade Commission and the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau and are being transferred inland, freight transport is quite light. Except for the Mei Shang Meta, which has been rerouted to Wenzhou, the Mei Shang New Anner has been rerouted to Zizhu Lin in Tianjin since the 14th because there is no cargo to load.</p>
<p>Moufu to Enter Dock for Repairs Today The Moufu, owned by the German firm Lihe, was originally scheduled to enter the dock for repairs on New Year's Eve last year, but was postponed due to the accumulation of Ningbo goods waiting to be transported. Now that the Ningbo goods have been largely cleared, the ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Ningbo and suspended sailing. It is scheduled to enter the British firm Rui Rong Shipyard in Yangshupu this morning for repairs and painting, and is expected to be completed in two weeks and resume sailing on the 1st of next month.</p>

<p>Many Companies and Factories Have Lost Licenses and Certificates Due to Relocation.</p>
<p>Due to the outbreak of war, many companies and factories have lost various licenses and certificates due to relocation. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has stipulated the following measures for submitting applications for reissuing licenses and certificates: (1) Those who have lost certificates, licenses, or registration certificates issued by the Ministry may apply to the Ministry for reissue in accordance with these measures, unless otherwise stipulated by law; (2) Applicants for reissue of licenses and certificates must publish a statement in the newspaper declaring the original license and certificate invalid, and submit the newspaper to the Ministry for verification; (3) Applicants for reissue of licenses and certificates must pay a handling fee of two yuan per item and attach the legal stamp tax fee.</p>

<p>Disguised as Civilians Infiltrating Qingpu</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, five men in plain clothes who had been shot dead were suddenly discovered outside Tailai Town, five *li* south of Qingpu City. After investigation by the Japanese-puppet authorities, they were identified as puppet "Pacification Soldiers," one of whom, surnamed Wang, was even a "squad leader" in the puppet "army." It is believed that they were disguised to go outside the city to inquire about the whereabouts of the guerrillas, were arrested, and executed. Afterwards, the Japanese-puppet brigade went to nearby villages to search, but found nothing. It is also reported that Huang Keming, a "patrol officer" in the puppet "police station" of the county, was also killed in the suburbs of Qingcheng a few days ago. Therefore, Yao Mingren, the puppet "magistrate," and all the other puppets, large and small, are in a state of panic.</p>

Having completed their business, they left Shanghai by ship for Hong Kong yesterday morning. It is heard that Lin and others also plan to go to the Southwest from Hong Kong to continue their inspection, and then return to Siam from Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The Indian revolutionary leader Nehru deeply sympathizes with our country's war of resistance to defend the nation. Therefore, he sent a letter to the National Association of Christian Young Men's Associations to convey his encouragement to Chinese students, urging them to fight to the end and strive for final victory. The translated text reads: "I represent the people of India in paying tribute to all the students of China. At the same time, I firmly believe that after the training of this great war of resistance, all the students of China will gain the greatest experience and strive for the final victory of the Chinese nation. After a nation has been tempered, it will forge a nobler character and accomplish the greatest mission. If your country's war of resistance can fight to the end, final victory is without doubt. I hope that the Chinese and Indian people, especially the young students, will always cooperate closely and jointly promote world peace."</p>
<h3 id="e57">Poisonous Atmosphere Permeates Nanjing; 50,000 Drug Addicts; Young People and Children Also Addicted; Opium Shipped from Dalian to Shanghai and Then to Nanjing <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>According to the *Chinese Mail*, a friend of a reporter from the *Menchster Guardian*, an American expatriate who has lived in Nanjing for a long time, wrote to the reporter based on direct observation and research, describing the increasing prevalence of drug dealing in Nanjing. While the details may contain minor errors, the general situation is undoubtedly true. According to his friend, the consumption of opium in Nanjing has been very low in recent decades, with only a few elderly businessmen secretly using it, especially in the last five years, because the government has been putting increasing pressure on this trade, thanks to the past thirty years of education and labor. Heroin was unheard of and quite expensive, costing 800 to 1,200 yuan per ounce. But today, heroin and opium are supplied in large quantities by the authorities or those with their support and protection, and the number of people addicted to them is enormous, and many children and young men and women are also addicted, which is destroying people's bodies and minds. Now anyone can obtain drugs easily at low prices. Even more seriously, licensed opium dens are openly advertising on the streets, claiming that consuming their drugs can improve health. 6,000 ounces of opium are sold daily, most of which is shipped from Dalian to Shanghai and then to Nanjing. Recently, 400 boxes of Iranian opium have also been shipped there. Hotels and brothels with special licenses all supply opium. However, the harm of opium is not as great as that of heroin. Not only adult men and women use heroin, but even children are addicted to it, which is lamentable. Once addicted, the addiction increases daily and is impossible to quit. And because it is cheap, its danger is even greater, because the cost of using heroin is less than half that of opium. According to private estimates, one-eighth of Nanjing's 400,000 people, or 50,000 people, are addicted to heroin. Others estimate the number even higher. Retailers of heroin are everywhere. This trade is mostly handled by Japanese shops that sell other goods but secretly sell heroin. There is general evidence to prove this. The names and locations of some Japanese shops that sell drugs are well known to many. He knows of at least one Japanese shop that does no other business except to ship heroin from Shanghai for distribution and retail. Those who travel by train or ship from Shanghai to Ningbo to sell goods also smuggle a small amount of heroin. If necessary, they bribe the military police to facilitate their passage. Of course, this is not new. Several years ago, it was heard that the Japanese had falsely established a tuberculosis sanatorium in a certain village in China, but in reality, they were selling heroin. He believes that these drugs are closely related to the troops that are poisoning Nanjing. Last year, when he returned to the United States and passed through Shanghai, he received information from coolie merchants and doctors that the situation in Shanghai and its surroundings was similar to that in Nanjing. Because the Japanese control and inspect the mail, this situation can only be reported to foreign countries through other channels.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Shantytown Residents on Rue Robert Call for Assistance <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Request Landlord Withdraw Order to Avoid Renewed Destitute Life: Liu Xiangzhou, Yu Jinsheng, Wang Shaoqing, and others, representatives of the shantytown residents at the intersection of Rue Robert and Jiaozhou Road, state that the landlord has issued a notice to reclaim the land for personal use, ordering them to demolish and relocate, causing widespread panic. Yesterday, they jointly submitted a petition to the First Special District Citizens' United Association and various public organizations, requesting assistance. The petition stated: "After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, our hometowns were devastated, and we came to Shanghai to seek refuge. Through the mediation of Jin Youfa, the manager of the Huxi Grand Theater, we rented a vacant lot at the intersection of Rue Robert and Jiaozhou Road from the landlord Ma Shankui, and built our own shacks as temporary shelters. We paid monthly rent, which has been increased several times. The current monthly rent payment is 120 yuan, yet this still does not satisfy the landlord's greed. Recently, a notice was posted, stating that the land was being reclaimed for personal use and ordering us to demolish and relocate within a specified period. This is like a bolt from the blue. At this critical time, we barely manage to support our families through hard work. Finding housing is simply a dream. If this order is enforced, it would condemn 500 men, women, and children to a life of renewed destitution, which would have a significant impact on social order. Therefore, we have specially submitted this petition, appealing to your sense of morality and human compassion to send a letter of persuasion to the landlord Ma Shankui, urging him to withdraw his order so that we may have peace of mind. We await your urgent response."</p>

However, it is a cargo ship and lacks passenger accommodations. The vessel was loaded with coal in Gdynia, Poland, and sailed to Shanghai via Sanang. It is expected to arrive today and dock at the Hongxing Wharf in Pudong to unload the coal. Future shipping affairs will still be managed by Wah Lun Shipping Company.</p>

<p>Japanese Armed Sentries Prevented Passage Without Explanation: The English-language "Great Evening News" reported that this morning (the 15th) from 8:25 AM to 8:45 AM, traffic on the three bridges over Suzhou Creek was blocked by the Japanese. There was also an increase in the number of Japanese armed sentries stationed on the bridges. The Japanese side has not issued an explanation for this action. The Public Concession Police Department is also unaware of the reason for this sudden traffic ban.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Daughter-in-Law Treats Mother-in-Law Like a Stranger: Elderly Woman Sues for Support. Daughter-in-Law is Wealthy but Never Provides Assistance: Court Orders Reconciliation; Hierarchy Cannot be Subject to Litigation <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Song Jingzhao, a widow residing at 16 Yanqing Lane, Xiamen Road, is the daughter-in-law of the late Zheng Shunnian from Songjiang. Shunnian had no sons and adopted his nephew, Gongwu (Zi Xiyong), as his son. After Gongwu married Song, they had three sons: Ruqiang, Ruzhen, and Ruding, who are all of school age. Shunnian and Gongwu died in 1925 and 1929, respectively. The hundreds of dan of rice rent from their estate, except for a portion inherited by</p>
<p>Shunnian's wife, Cheng Yulian, the remaining rent, as well as the incense shop, restaurant, and silk store jointly operated in Songjiang and Suzhou, are all managed by Song. Song has always had disagreements with her mother-in-law, Cheng, so Cheng, now over seventy years old, rents a residence at 74 Hengmao Lane, Baxianqiao. Not only do the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law treat each other like strangers, but also the three grandsons, following their mother's instructions, are unaware of the joy of filial piety. In recent years, due to the chaos of military unrest, rice rent is difficult to collect, causing the elderly woman's</p>
<p>livelihood to become difficult. Although her daughter-in-law is wealthy, she never provides any assistance. Cheng has hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against her daughter-in-law Song Jingzhao and grandsons Zheng Ruqiang, Ruzhen, and Ruding in the First Special District Court, requesting that 120 yuan per month for living expenses be paid for five years, totaling 7,200 yuan, from the public funds managed by Song, and pleading that, considering her poverty, she be temporarily exempted from paying court fees. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Gui Yu opened the court to summon the defendants. Only the eldest son, Ruqiang, the second son, Ruzhen, and their appointed lawyer appeared. The plaintiff, due to old age and illness, was unable to appear in person and was represented by her lawyer. After the lawyer presented the grounds for the lawsuit, Judge Gui questioned Zheng Ruqiang, who stated that he was eighteen years old, a student, that his mother was forty-nine years old, and that the plaintiff was his grandmother, now seventy-one years old and currently ill, etc. The court then instructed that</p>
<p>the hierarchy between grandparents, grandchildren, mother-in-law, and daughter-in-law is obvious and should not be subject to litigation. Moreover, your grandfather and father left behind so much property; how can you bear to ignore this elderly grandmother? You should return home and persuade your mother to quickly visit her and resolve her living difficulties, settling the matter peacefully out of court. You should also ask your grandmother not to be misled by slander and to avoid internal strife. If a settlement cannot be reached, the hearing will be adjourned to the morning of March 29th, at which time your mother must appear in person for review.</p>

<p>Chen Shuwen, a Jiangbei native and owner of the Wuzhou Massage Parlor at 3 Yuren Lane, Yuqiaqing Road, and Yan Yizhong, owner of the Samsung Massage Parlor at 5 Wenyuan Lane, 83 of the same road, were extremely friendly. During the Lunar New Year, Yan was invited by Chen to gamble on pai gow at Chen's place. As a result, Yan lost over 300 yuan. After paying some cash, Yan still owed Chen 90 yuan. However, Yan later discovered that the</p>
<p>pai gow tiles and dice used by Chen were rigged, so gamblers had no chance of winning. Yan refused to pay the remaining 90 yuan, causing animosity between Chen and Yan. On the 13th of the month, Chen Shuwen reported to the Old Gate Police Station that he had received an anonymous threatening letter on the 8th. The wording was extreme, demanding 3,000 yuan, or else he would face dangerous consequences. He ignored it. On the 12th, he received</p>
<p>another letter, criticizing him for breaking his promise and ordering him to make contact at the entrance of Wenyuan Lane, Yuqiaqing Road, on the 14th, or else his head would be taken. Therefore, he had no choice but to report it. He presented the two letters. The Chinese detective Wang Shanqing, detectives Song Wenqing, Gao Yongan, and Ding Yizhong, together with Chen Shuwen, went to the entrance of Wenyuan Lane on the afternoon of the 14th</p>
<p>to wait. Soon, Yan arrived and chatted with Chen. The detectives then stepped forward and arrested him, taking him back to the police station. Yan confessed to writing the threatening letter and stated that the letter was written by Shen Jinrong (also known as Xiao Piaojiang), a Jiangbei native. The detectives then went to 698 Edward Road and arrested Shen, taking him back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court Criminal Division 1. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, prosecuted them for attempted</p>
<p>extortion using intimidation under Article 346, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code. Under questioning by Qian Hongye, the chief judge of the criminal division, the two defendants vehemently denied the charges, claiming they were being framed and requesting justice. The court, finding the case to be doubtful, Ru Baoyi requested a postponement for further investigation. If the court did not deem it necessary to detain the defendants, he requested permission for bail. Judge Qian then ordered the case to be adjourned for another hearing. Yan and Shen were each granted bail to appear when summoned and released to await summons.</p>

<p>At approximately 10:30 PM last night, at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Tenant de la Tour, a black-plated car was parked on the side of the road. Two Russian patrol officers on bicycles passed by and noticed many people in the car, acting suspiciously. They stepped forward to search. Upon opening the car door, they found a total of four people inside. It was claimed that one of them had been kidnapped from elsewhere. Two handguns were found on the other three. They were immediately arrested and taken to the police station and were to be sent to the Second Special Court this morning for investigation. However, the true details of the kidnapping case will be reported after further investigation.</p>

<p>The Longhua Shanghai Cement Factory, managed by the German firm Arnhold, Karberg &amp; Co., was forcibly occupied by the Japanese. All the stock was transported and sold, and the raw materials were used to continue production. The cement produced was still marketed under the name of the domestic "Elephant Brand." Arnhold, Karberg &amp; Co. published a statement in the newspapers and warned the public not to purchase the stolen goods.

<p>Zou Chunfang, the manager of the Wan Tai Company, located in the Kenye Building on Beijing Road, recently hired lawyer Jin Ximin to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the First Special District against the chairman and executive committee members of the Shanghai Sand and Stone Industry Association, Lu Andan (also known as Xiaozuo), Cao Genggui, Fang Changgen, and Zhou Yongde, for the crimes of joint defamation and incitement to obstruct freedom. He requested that they be punished according to Article 304, Paragraph 1 and Article 310, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, and filed a civil lawsuit, requesting that the court order the defendants to publish the entire judgment as a cover advertisement in the "Xinwen," "Shen Bao," "Shi Bao," and "Wenhui" newspapers for three days each. After the war, the construction industry in this city boomed, and the sand and stone necessary for building were scarce due to transportation and procurement difficulties, causing prices to skyrocket. Therefore, Zou Chunfang and others formed the Wan Tai Company to specialize in purchasing sand and stone from Sijiao and bidding for contracts. When the goods arrived, the unloading work was contracted to Xia Zhiji at a bid price of 1.45 cents per ton. Because the company had not joined the Sand and Stone Industry Association, it was maliciously promoted as an organization established by traitors, colluding with certain parties and using special forces to monopolize the sand and stone industry. In addition to suffering damage to its business, the damage to its reputation was even more difficult to calculate. Therefore, they had no choice but to file a lawsuit. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce of the First Special Court opened the Criminal Court No. 8 to summon the defendants. The plaintiff's agent, lawyer Jin Ximin, presented various documents and letters to prove the defendants' criminal conduct and requested an appropriate judgment. After Judge Zhan's investigation, he ordered that the hearing be adjourned for further summons.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Trivial Notes on a Southwestern Journey (Part Two) <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Quechang</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the fourteenth, we bid farewell to the indescribably lovely Qijiang. After only three hours on the road, we arrived at Haitangxi, the final bus stop on the opposite bank of Chongqing. It took just ten minutes to cross the river from Haitangxi to Chongqing. The ferry ran three or four times an hour, making it very convenient.</p>
<p>Chongqing is built against the mountains, and the roads are extraordinarily steep. The docks are dozens of feet above the river surface, accessible by stone steps, making construction quite difficult. The houses here are all made of wooden planks, and although they look decent from the outside, the interiors are incredibly simple. Someone in our group said, "One person goes upstairs, and the whole house shakes," which is no exaggeration. The weather is terrible, with constant clouds and fog. We stayed in Chongqing for fourteen days, and only two days were sunny, and even then, we only saw the sun for half a day. I heard that it won't be consistently sunny until next spring. The cost of living in Chongqing is incredibly high, especially for foreign goods or items from Shanghai, which are even more expensive. A bar of Guben soap from the Wuzhou Pharmacy costs fifty cents, which gives you an idea of everything else.</p>
<p>From Guiyang to Chongqing, the stretch between Tongzi and Songkan is the most dangerous. Along the way, there are towering mountains and cliffs thousands of feet high. The car winds its way along the mountain roads, and we hardly dared to look down. Tragic accidents of cars overturning are often heard of. Even now, talking about it, I still feel a chill.</p>
<p>On the twenty-sixth, we returned to Guiyang. After a ten-day stay, we set off again for Kunming. We had lunch in Anshun along the way, passing the famous Huangguoshu Waterfall, which was truly magnificent. We stayed overnight in An'nan. The Panjiang Hotel here wasn't as bad as the Jianjiang Hotel, but it was still poorly managed. I heard that the China Travel Service is going to take it back and run it themselves, which would be a blessing for travelers if it succeeds. Just half a mile from An'nan, we encountered a rugged mountain road called "Twenty-Four Turns," which the locals simply call Twenty-Four Bends. The roadbed is entirely made of crushed stone. The degree of danger as the car descends is self-evident. However, the scenery along the way is also rarely beautiful. We had lunch that day in Panjiang, and in the evening, we arrived in Pingyi. The accommodation in Pingyi was quite comfortable after being improved by the travel agency.</p>
<p>On the third day of departure, we set off from Pingyi, had lunch in Qujing at noon, and arrived in Kunming at 3:30 in the afternoon. Kunming's elevation is more than 1,900 meters above sea level, so it's relatively cool in the morning and evening, but warm as spring at midday. Kunming has many scenic spots, which cannot be described in just a few words. The market in Kunming is indeed quite prosperous, and the cost of living is very high, although not as high as in Chongqing. The currency here is divided into two types: new Yunnan currency (issued by the Fudian New Bank) and old Yunnan currency. Each yuan of new Yunnan currency is worth fifty cents in national currency, while each yuan of old Yunnan currency is only worth ten cents. Speaking of currency, I must add a few words: When using legal tender in various places along the southwest, the banknotes of the Central Bank are the best. It's not easy to exchange five-yuan and ten-yuan bills, so it's best to bring fewer of them. Also, nickel coins are not very welcome; new corner notes are best. Because Kunming is connected to French Annam, Vietnamese currency is also circulating in Kunming. The language of the people of Kunming is easy to understand. Their pronunciation is only slightly heavier than Mandarin.</p>
<p>On December 15th, we set off from Kunming to Haiphong. The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was built by the French over ten years of operation. The greatness of the engineering is indeed not comparable to the national railways. There are more than 160 large tunnels along the way, and the scenery along the way is extremely beautiful. Ordinary passenger trains depart from Kunming every day, and it takes four days to reach Haiphong. These trains run during the day, and at night, passengers have to get off the train to find accommodation. There is also a type of Michelin (Meschijin) car that resembles a bus. It has twelve rubber wheels in the front and rear and is powered by gasoline, running along the tracks at high speed. It takes only twenty-two hours from Kunming to Hanoi. This car runs twice a week. The first-class seats are all leather sofas, which are very comfortable. The third-class seats are wooden and there is no second class. If passengers are traveling third class and want to change to a sleeping car in Lao Cai, they can ask the ticket inspector on the train to buy a second-class sleeper, as there are no sleeping cars in third class, and it is impossible to sleep comfortably. Michelin cars are only allowed to carry 15 kilograms of luggage with them, and there is also 30 kilograms of free luggage that can be sent to the station two days before departure and ask them to transport it to Lao Cai in advance. Passengers' luggage is subject to very strict inspection at Hekou, and the situation is very chaotic. You must be especially careful and bring as little luggage as possible. Passengers' passports should first be inspected at the Commissioner's Office in Hekou, then taken across the bridge to Lao Cai and left with the police station. Then, you can go to the station to board the train. The Hekou Commissioner's Office and the Chinese Customs impose restrictions on the amount of money that outbound passengers can carry, generally no more than 200 yuan in national currency. If the limit is exceeded, all the money will be confiscated. There are no restrictions on entry.</p>
<p>On this route, it's best to bring your own meals, as there is very little palatable and hygienic food along the way, and the climate is extremely harsh. If you are careless with your diet, it is easy to get sick. It's best to bring more quinine and take one or two pills every day to prevent illness.</p>
<p>Vietnamese people's surnames are based on the last character of their given name, so fathers and sons or brothers often do not share the same surname. Most Vietnamese people over the age of forty-five still understand Chinese characters but cannot speak Mandarin. If you communicate with them in writing, you can barely manage. Finally, let me summarize in two sentences: Travelers to the southwest must be able to endure hardship and be resourceful. Bring as little luggage as possible, but don't skimp on essential items. If you are entering Yunnan from Haiphong, don't bring anything new, as you are sure to be cheated, because Haiphong taxes are terrible.</p>

<p>The Zhenfeng Copper Factory, owned by Guo Xuexiang, was previously located on Jixiang Road in Zhabei. Since the outbreak of the war, the factory moved to No. 105 Binlang Road, and the warehouse was located at No. 4, Lane 318, Avenue Edward VII. Due to debt issues, the factory owed money to the Bank of China, so the Bank of China appointed an employee, Kong Shangang, to be stationed permanently at the Zhenfeng Copper Factory to supervise everything.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, since February 13th of this year, several threatening letters were delivered to Manager Kong of the factory, signed as the Second Regiment of the Central People's Self-Defense Army Political Training Office. The words inside were fierce, intending to extort 2,000 yuan. Upon receiving the report, the Xinzha Police Station ordered Detective Yang Peizhang and Detective Gong Youwei to investigate. It was not until 7:00 p.m. last night that the suspects in this case, Zhang Guozhen and Wan Xiaozhang, both from Yangzhou, were arrested at the intersection of Hardoon Road and Singapore Road. An unmailed threatening letter was found on Zhang, containing a bullet. The letter stated that the factory had not negotiated in good faith and should be fined 10,000 yuan. It also accused the factory of dealing with Japanese merchants and being traitors. They were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case, requesting a postponement. Factory owner Guo Xuexiang also filed a complaint, proving that the two defendants were former workers in the factory who had been dismissed. Questioned, the two defendants confessed that the matter was initiated by Rong Abing, who is still at large. All the threatening letters were written by a fortune-telling stall. Judge Xiao ordered the two defendants to be detained for a retrial in seven days.</p>

<p>Xi Lanqing, a local resident of Hongkou, became wealthy through business. After his death, he left behind a considerable estate of over two million yuan. His descendants are now in dispute over the division of the estate and have filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court. The plaintiff is a woman, Xi Zhou, along with her children Xi Leshan, Xi Shuqin, Xi Shuyan, and Xi Shuying. The defendants are Xi Lang, Xi Deshen, Xi Furen, Xi Fukang, Xi Fuquan, and Xi Fengyun, requesting the court to order the defendants to divide the property according to their shares. However, the defendants then filed a counterclaim against Xi Zhou et al., requesting the court to approve the revocation of the contract and to distribute the estate into thirteen shares instead of the original eleven shares. Although the court has summoned and examined the case several times, ordering out-of-court settlements, no agreement has been reached. Therefore, Judge Gui held a hearing again yesterday afternoon. However, neither of the parties was present, and the litigation fees paid were also insufficient. Therefore, the court adjourned the hearing for further review.</p>

<p>Liu Biao, also known as Wang Jinlian and Xiaogouzi, a 23-year-old man from Jiangbei, was sentenced to eight years in prison and eight years of deprivation of civil rights for shooting and attempting to assassinate Li Hongxing, the owner of the Lixingji Transportation Company from Shandong, on December 12th of last year at around 3:00 p.m. Liu appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, arguing that his original trial confession was overturned, claiming that someone else had fired the gun and then stuffed the gun into his pocket while fleeing. The Third Branch of the High Court deliberated and concluded the case, scheduling a sentencing hearing. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., Presiding Judge Wu Tingqi, accompanied by Judges Chen and Wang, attended the Third Criminal Court and ruled that Liu Biao's appeal was rejected.</p>

<p>Zhang Lankun, a 37-year-old man from Yangzhou, is currently unemployed and resides in a cubicle at No. 13 Xiandel Lane, Yuchiaqing Road. His wife, Wang, is the same age. A few days ago, they introduced a fellow villager, Cao Dayi (20 years old), to work as a prostitute at Xiaoxizi's house at No. 17 in the same lane. Later, the police detected this and detained Zhang, Wang, and Cao. As a result, Zhang was fined six yuan and released, and Cao was sent to a relief society. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon at 1:00 p.m., Cao took the opportunity to escape and returned to Zhang's place, asking Wang to smooth things over with Xiaoxizi and expressing her willingness to continue her life as a prostitute. Lankun was furious upon hearing this and severely rebuked his wife, ordering her to escort Cao back to the relief society. She had no choice but to obey. However, Xiaoxizi lived nearby and learned about this later. Considering that Zhang was delivering a cash cow, he came to Zhang's residence to demand justice, leading to an argument. Xiaoxizi then took out a sharp blade and stabbed Zhang twice in the right leg, causing blood to gush out like a spring. The assailant took the opportunity to flee. The injured man was reported to the patrol by his family and taken to the Tung Jen Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>More than 8,000 Work-Relief Refugees Reached Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Society’s Relief of War Zone Refugees Committee, in order to be seriously concerned with the affairs of the association, specially appointed standing committee member Guan Jiongzhi as vice chairman. After being appointed, Guan visited the association yesterday to take up his duties. In addition, in order to actively relieve refugees, the association has been working hard to open up refugee outlets. Last month, a survey of refugees who obtained work reached more than 8,000 people, some of whom are already able to support themselves. The association has set up five self-sufficiency stations for self-sufficient refugees to live in. Another part of the production income is not enough to support themselves, so 20% of their income is taken and stored as a refugee production fund, which is used to support the refugee production business. This approach is enough to break the selfish concept of refugees and promote the spirit of self-help and helping others, so it is not only limited to economic significance, but also contains educational significance.</p>

<p>The North-China Daily News said that yesterday (14th) at 1:50 p.m., a car driven by a Japanese person caused an accident at the intersection of Jiaxing Road and Dixiwei Road, hitting five Chinese pedestrians, all of whom were seriously injured. A public concession patrolman on duty nearby summoned an ambulance, but it was blocked by the Japanese, who did not allow the injured to be taken to the hospital, insisting on using a military truck to send them to the Japanese Marine Corps Hospital on Jiangwan Road. It is said that there were five or six Japanese people in the car, trying to overtake a truck. The driver saw an obstacle ahead and braked suddenly, causing the car to swerve onto the east side of the sidewalk and hit five Chinese people who were walking on the road at the time. The Jiaxing Road Police Station is currently investigating the matter. Although it is heard that the injuries of the injured are quite serious, it was not until late last night that they were able to find out the extent of their injuries.</p>

<p>The North-China Daily News reported that Mrs. Gant, a Western woman, rode alone in a car driven by a rickshaw puller from her residence on Taopeng Road into the city at 12:30 p.m. yesterday (14th). On the way, they overtook a car carrying six Japanese people. Unexpectedly, the Japanese were dissatisfied with this and, in order to vent their anger, forced Mrs. Gant's car to stop near Broadway and Maoming Road, and forcibly dragged the rickshaw puller out of the car and treated him badly, causing the rickshaw puller to suffer minor injuries to his head. Mrs. Gant tried to intervene, but it was ineffective. It is said that the incident occurred because the Japanese car was driving very slowly, and Mrs. Gant's car overtook it, which angered the Japanese, who drove after Mrs. Gant's car, forced it to stop, dragged out the rickshaw puller, and beat him severely. It is also heard that these Japanese said that the rickshaw puller was driving too fast, so they were giving him "punishment". According to the news obtained last night, although the incident has been reported to the Public Concession Police Department, no other news has been received until late at night.</p>

<p>However, Registration Fees Must Be Borne By Rickshaw Pullers The Public Concession Municipal Council's replacement of public rickshaw pullers' licenses expired on the 14th. The Special District Rickshaw Association, because there were still many who had not yet replaced their licenses, sent Yin Zhiling, Hou Shaoan, Gu Songmao, and Wang Kunyi to the Municipal Council yesterday morning to request an extension from General Manager Philip. As a result, an extension of ten days was granted. The association specially notified all car owners, rickshaw pullers, and lessors yesterday, saying, "For the purpose of notification, the Public Concession Municipal Council Rickshaw Management Office's regulations for rickshaw pullers to replace their 1939 new licenses have been announced and expired on March 14. After investigation, the deadline has expired, and some rickshaw pullers have not completed the procedures for replacing their new licenses within the deadline. In order to take care of the rickshaw pullers and avoid losses, with the consent of the Municipal Council Rickshaw Management Office, the deadline for rickshaw pullers to replace their new licenses will be extended to March 25. All rickshaw pullers who hold old licenses and pull cars for at least fifteen shifts per month and have not yet replaced their 1939 new licenses are requested to replace their new licenses at the Rickshaw Puller Licensing Office on Gordon Road before March 25, but rickshaw pullers must bear the registration fees themselves. If the number of rickshaw pullers replacing their new licenses is insufficient after the deadline, new rickshaw puller registration will begin on March 27, and the registration fee will be borne by the rickshaw pullers themselves. I am afraid that it has not been fully informed, so this special notification is given."</p>

<h3 id="e92">Second Anti-War Propaganda Week - Today is Cultural Circle Propaganda Day - Publication of Letter to Colleagues in Cultural Circles - And Telegram to the Country Uniting Efforts <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Today is the fifth day of the Anti-War Propaganda Week held by the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters leading all sectors. The city's cultural groups held a joint meeting yesterday, deciding to publish a letter to colleagues in the city's cultural circles, and telegram to the country's cultural circles, unanimously mobilizing the people, supporting national policy, and working hard on the great task of resisting war and building the country. The text is as follows:</p>
<p>To Colleagues in the City's Cultural Circles: Comrades in Shanghai's cultural circles, since the "September 18th" incident's bloody bell resounded throughout the world, we, all Shanghai and all China's cultural circles comrades, have unanimously deeply believed that the ambition of Japanese imperialists cannot be solved by diplomatic politics and other methods. To shatter the enemy's delusional dreams of invasion, the only way is to use the power of the entire nation to give the aggressor a head-on blow. Therefore, we unanimously awakened the nation's compatriots' awareness of resisting the enemy. Before the formal launch of the war, the entire nation should fully cultivate its human, financial, and material resources. After the "July 7th" Lugou Bridge Incident, our supreme leader Chiang Kai-shek loudly called on the nation's people, "The final moment has arrived, once the war is launched, we must exert the power of the whole country, resist the war to the end, sacrifice to the end, and strive for our final victory." At this time, the nation's cultural circles first explained the leader's instructions carefully and analyzed them in detail, so that the national people's anti-war consciousness was clear and firm, and the national people's anti-war emotions were promoted. After the "August 13th" Battle of Shanghai officially began, all Shanghai cultural people not only continued to use their pens to do all kinds of anti-war cultural work, but also many cultural people actually participated in various anti-enemy support work. Since the National Army moved west, Shanghai has become an isolated island, and the environment is extremely dangerous, but our cultural people have always stood in their posts, unyielding, struggling hard, and fulfilled our cultural people's responsibilities. The past is not enough to be complacent, but based on past experience, we can improve our future work, and the later stage of the war has already begun, and what remains for the efforts of our colleagues in the cultural circles is even more urgent. Now, the following points are listed for mutual encouragement regarding the areas in which the various departments of the cultural circles should make special efforts in the future.</p>
<p>First, the news media should report the situation of the later stage of the war, the comparison of the strengths of the enemy and us, the atrocities of the enemy and the traitors, and the heroic deeds of our soldiers and civilians, to the readers at any time in detail. The writing should be as popular as possible, and the content should be as detailed as possible, so that women, children, and the elderly throughout the country can deeply understand the general trend of the current war and jointly strengthen their hatred of the enemy.</p>
<p>Second, the publishing industry should systematically publish books on anti-war theory, and the content should be pure and the pricing should be kept low. Special attention should be paid to the reading materials for industrial groups, so that more than 90% of the country's population of workers and farmers have a constant supply of spiritual food.</p>
<p>Third, the literary and art circles have devoted themselves to the writing of anti-war literature and the establishment of literary and art communication networks, but the harvest is still not up to our expectations. We hope that the colleagues in the literary and art circles will make special efforts in the future and should have greater works.</p>
<p>Fourth, the film industry, the environment of the film industry on this isolated island is quite difficult. We hope that our comrades in the film industry will continue to struggle unyieldingly. We should double our efforts in the production of anti-war films. Even if we cannot show them in Shanghai, we can send them to the mainland, because film is the most popular and powerful weapon in the anti-war cultural movement.</p>
<p>Fifth, the drama industry has been a department with very good work performance during this war of resistance. Since the National Army moved west, the drama industry has continued to work. We hope that in the future, in addition to working hard on performances, we should also make more efforts in the production of new scripts. Other reforms in Peking opera and entertainment circles are also imminent. The field of culture is very broad. Now, only the above five departments are pointed out. I hope that my colleagues in the cultural circles of the whole city will uphold the "war of resistance will be victorious" and "nation-building will be successful" confidence, mobilize all citizens, support the national policy of resistance to the war, and fight to the end with Japanese imperialists. Shanghai City Cultural Groups Joint Conference.</p>
<p>To the National Cultural Circles: To all colleagues in the national cultural circles, today is the cultural circle propaganda day of Shanghai's Anti-War Propaganda Week. The colleagues in the cultural circles of this city believe that during this period of resisting the war and building the country, the responsibility of our cultural circles is of utmost importance and urgency. Under the guidance of the supreme leader, we should strive hard to awaken our compatriots and strengthen our hatred of the enemy. Mobilizing the people to achieve the merit of avenging shame is our inescapable duty as pioneers of the people. This telegram is sent to be heard. Please encourage each other. Shanghai City Cultural Groups Joint Conference.</p>

<p>— 水鳥</p>
<p>隨著長期的軍旅生活，蔣委員長年年都在行動中。早些時候，當他還身陷內戰漩渦時，就常常以鐵路線上的一節或兩節火車車廂作為臨時司令部和起居之所。那時對敵方面，大概是缺少飛機的，而火車可以隨時沿鐵路線開動，所以這樣的司令部是最機動的；同樣，他也曾以兵艦作為來往指揮之用。到了最近幾年，他東南西北的行蹤，主要依靠飛機來往。他用汽車的時候，通常是前後三輛汽車同時出入。不過他並不是處處如此，在抗戰前，常常在傍晚時與夫人並肩出行，散步片刻。有一次，有幾個飛行員晚飯後一同到某郊外，在幾塊石頭上，坐著高談闊論的時候，忽然看見前面一男一女，並肩緩步走來，在暮色蒼茫中，看不清楚是誰，繼續大聲說笑；直到走近面前，才知道是委員長夫婦也來此散步，那時候，幾個飛行員非常狼狽，立刻停止說話，急忙把煙頭扔掉熄滅，大家一起立正行禮。可是蔣委員長並不似平時那麼嚴厲，他讓他們隨便一些，並且說大家在休息中，不比執行職守的時候，不必過於拘禮。他又請大家照舊談天吸煙，雖然他自己是不吸煙的。同時，他們倆自己也坐下來，詢問他們的生活情況。這件事可以說明他在某種行動中，很為隨便，不像一般偉人那樣顧忌而鋪張。不過在某種緊急的期間，他常常能以迅雷不及掩耳的速度，走向他要去的地方，在暴風大雨中，他突然而行，甚至他的侍衛人員，一時也有措手不及之勢。</p>
<h3 id="e106">林主席的走路談 <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 清那</p>
<p>黨國元老中，年歲最長者，當推國府主席林森，他向來以儉樸著稱，對於行動的問題，尤其儉約。一般人心目中，以為身為一國元首，理應舉止闊綽，出入都以最富麗高貴的流線型汽車代步，實際上林森除了公務需要，以及特殊情形外，總是喜歡徒步而行，而且不喜歡大批衛隊，或便衣隊跟隨。還記得兩年前，筆者在南京國府文官處工作時，某日在朱雀路遇到這位聞名全國的首領，因為他正在某書店中，購買線裝古書，目光炯炯，神采煥發，身穿藍布馬褂，外面罩著一件大氅，腳上穿的，不過是一雙粗布鞋而已！身旁僅有隨從兩人，出書店後，沿朱雀路徒步走到秦淮小公園，市民聽說主席光臨，無不蜂擁前往，一睹風采，林森略作片刻巡視後，就點頭含笑而去，市民對主席如此儉樸，無不為之肅然起敬。國府為他建造的主席官邸在中山陵園，一切陳設，也頗為樸素，至於他所備的汽車，僅僅是中等的福特式而已。只有每逢謁見中山陵時，則另備一頂呢轎，因為由陵麓到中山堂時，必須經過數百級高階，如果由人攙扶上下，有很多不便，反而不如乘轎來得方便，所以每年元旦，雙十節，總理誕辰，以及逝世紀念日，中央要人，大多徒步上下中山墓，林主席則獨自乘轎前往，市民一見此轎，就知道其中一定是林主席。又春秋兩季出外遊歷時，主席更喜歡徒步旅行，曾經對人說：「美麗的景色，只有步行時才能領略得到，我雖然精神欠佳，但能步行時，必定多多步行，因為安步當車，其樂無窮啊！」抗戰以來，他赴重慶後，據說那頂常用的呢轎，早已棄置不用，甚至汽車也不常使用，可見他公忠為國的一斑，或許有在重慶遇到主席的人，都說他的精神更加矍鑠，步履也更為矯健，而且常對人說：「不久我將重回京華，為中山先生掃墓了！」</p>

<p>我們在上海所看到的馬路，大多是石子路和柏油路居多，我們在內地所看到的馬路，大多是泥路和木塊路居多。當然，關於用金剛鑽，鋼鐵，橡皮，玻璃瓶，糖漿棉花等鋪成的路，還沒有見到過，非但沒有見到過，也許連聽都沒有聽到過。</p>
<p>但奇怪的是，這倒不是神話，而是千真萬確的事實。——世界上偏偏有這許多使人不容易相信的事實。</p>
<p>這裡，我來粗略的說一點。</p>
<p>在南非洲金巴里的一條路，價值高達五〇〇·〇〇〇元美金。它的建築，非常奇怪，在泥土上都鑲滿了光彩奪目的金剛鑽，其中最大的一顆，大概有小的葡萄那麼大。據說那條路上，日夜都有警察看守，以防宵小盜竊。</p>
<p>在英國倫敦，有許多路，都是用鋼鐵製成的。這種路的優點，就是「堅固」，無論怎樣重的載貨汽車，也不能在路面上擦起一點傷痕來。</p>
<p>用橡皮造路，有很多好處，不過造價太貴了一點。蘇格蘭，意大利，澳大利亞這些地方，都曾試驗過，其中以澳大利亞成績最佳。</p>
<p>玻璃瓶是一種廢物，但是卻可以作為造路的材料。英國有位科學家，他曾把玻璃瓶和其他各種碎玻璃，混合在一起，等它溶化後，澆入模型，製成一個個方塊，用以作為鋪路的磚頭，這些玻璃磚塊，較之石子，更為堅固。</p>
<p>糖漿也是一種廢物，這在熱帶製蔗區域，真多得可以俯拾皆是。現在在印度地方，有很多「衝柏油馬路」的「糖漿路」。這些路的造法很是簡便，代價也不能算貴。在製造時，先將糖漿用水調和，加熱後鋪在潔淨的馬路上，再用粗沙蓋住，等冷了後，就與「柏油路」完全相同。</p>
<p>在南卡羅來納，他們把棉花也列入築路材料中不可缺少的一項。棉花的質地很軟，當然不能單獨應用，不過如把它夾在二層柏油之間，那就可成為網形的一個堅固物，這堅固物，與鋼骨有同樣的效用。</p>
<p>還有許多奇特的道路。譬如美國有一條很別緻的道路，是用樟腦樹木塊鋪成的，外表真美麗極了。</p>
<p>在蘇俄士答拉魯里士地方，有一條用碎玉黃寶石，孔雀綠，碧玉等珍貴品鋪成的道路，路面的華麗，和造價的昂貴，當然是不言而喻。</p>
<p>有一位科學家，他正在研究用人造絲廠所產的膠狀廢物，和石子沙泥混合後，成為水泥的代用品，據說這項計劃，已屢試屢驗，我們將來對於道路上的幫助，力量一定是很偉大的。</p>
<h3 id="e109">談自行車（上） <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— 騎士</p>
<p>自行車俗名腳踏車，因為所佔地位不大，隨處可放，且每年繳納執照費四元幾角之外，並沒有其他費用，（修理費又當另論）在一切車輛中，是最輕便最經濟的交通利器。自十九世紀迄今，歐美各國，盛行此物，丹麥國人幾乎每人置備一輛，沿途觸目皆是，停放之時，不必加鎖，沒有被竊之虞。法國每年舉行環繞全國境三千英里長途比賽，轟動全球。聽說德國將籌備五千英里比賽，盛況空前，可以預料。英國近郊則有斜坡狀賽道的設置，專為一般自行車運動家使用。自行車會在該地最為發達，每逢假日，常常看見男女老幼，結隊遊行。我國於四十年前由西洋僑民及留美學生一度提倡，終因沒有良好道路，不能發展，上海張園曾建賽場一處，不久拆毀。後來有人在海格路建造衛樂園，提倡職業比賽，於是使業餘運動，受到阻礙，所以不久也歸於消滅。該處賽場，因為斜度不合標準，賽員受傷的頗多，這也是失敗的原因之一。此外尚舉行道路比賽數次，（一次為國際比賽在貝當路一帶舉行，一次為道路協會主辦在市中心舉行）成績平平，最近上海車會（該會為中國唯一自行車會，中西男女會員甚多，會長唐觀翼先生提倡駕駛自行車作消遣或運動不遺餘力）在膠州公園舉行第二屆自行車比賽，聘請工部局副總董麥克諾登將軍為贊助人，觀眾甚多，對女會員自行車遊行表演，尤其讚許，可見國人愛好此道者之眾了。</p>
<p>自行車除男式女式外，又分跑車與平車兩種，我國市場稱英國貨為頭號，德國貨為二號，日本貨為三號，每輛價格自三十餘元起，至二百餘元止不等。銷路以平車雙飛為多，乘跑車者都為青年學生，這些人對牌子的選擇，獨具慧眼，因此德國貨絕跡市上，價值六七十元的日本貨，也寥寥無幾，英國貨乃能獨霸。同昌車行的三槍牌，安輪車行的翼牌，得利車行的來令，稱為跑車三傑。平車則因為使用範圍較廣，差役送信，店夥送貨，沒有不用它代步的，所以價廉的雜牌日本貨，銷路第一。德國貨以另件為多，如鋼絲踏腳鏈條等，銷路很好，至於完全德國貨的車，每輛售價最低也要七八十元，所以購買者寧願多付十數元代價，買一堅固耐用的英國車，以免日後修理麻煩。全市約十二萬輛自行車，裝鄧祿普及強步車胎的，佔十分之八九，近來大中華出品雙錢牌輪胎，營業也不錯，深願該廠推銷得法，為國貨爭光。此外書包架翼子板撐腳等，我國也能自製，銷路不惡，至於雙飛鏈條及鋼圈因為成本關係，不能與舶來品爭一日之長短，實在可嘆。</p>
<p>自行車的構造，乍看之下，似乎頗為簡單，其實另件多達百數十種，如果想要一一舉出，不是一朝一夕可以完成的事。跑車與平車最顯著的分別，為把手，（俗稱龍頭）車輪也不同。大抵跑車車輪直徑為二十六寸，輪胎寬一寸二分，平車車輪自二十四寸起至二十八寸止，輪胎寬一寸半。跑車車架以後身焊牢的為佳，圓形的前車腳，下端實心，似璧式者，為精品，扁形與平車車腳相同的，不是上品。（未完）</p>

<p>— 穎工</p>
<p>我們不要依照美國軍隊四人一排的制度，也不要依照二人一列的制度。若以全世界的中國人，每三人一排，一齊向一定的目標地前進，那麼任由他們如何走法，可是結果總是不能走到目的地。</p>
<p>這並不是虛話，我們中國人口共有四萬萬七千餘萬，現在以四萬萬五千萬為標準，每三個人成一列。倘若每小時的速度為三英里，每日平均的速度為十五英里，那麼要走完一個地方，便需要二十二年又三百天的光景，幾乎是二十三年的時間了。至於每年每地所經過的人數，計算下來是一千九百五十六萬人有餘，差不多是二千萬人了。再假如中國人的生育率是百分之十，那麼每年又得加上四千五百萬人，若其中二千五百萬人算是兒童夭折的人數，則每年純增加的人數是二千萬。所以當前列在一年之中在某地經過二千萬人，在表面上雖然是少了二千萬人，可是實際上在排尾又添加了二千萬的新國民，與一年前未通過二千萬人一般。因此之故，這長長的隊伍，便永遠沒有走完的一天了。</p>

<p>證券暗盤，昨日市況繼續上漲甚猛，已將三月十日之最近高價突破，丙種並突破五十二元關卡，已接近一月十日之高價，市場人氣高昂，實為最近興奮的良好現象，環境上沒什麼新發展，市價猛漲一元多，出間稍有人為不盡自然，難免因漲風過暴，引起回跌，但其趨勢終仍為曲線上漲，看下午收盤時價已略略回軟，只以天生號忽來抬價，並有樂茂號為之臂助，丙丁戊種復行突破二元及一元關卡，此種欣榮，乃稍微嫌其略覺勉強而已。</p>
<p>昨日經過，開盤，天生號首先買進，繼之者有四十一及四十九號，吸收也頗有力，恆孚號亦有相當收進，市價直線上漲，丙種衝出本月十日之五十一元四角高價後，竟上達兩元，後因大豐號仍有出籠，同康號也有賣出，散戶也出多進少，德孚號賣乙種買丙戊種，市價乃稍稍壓小，但午前已好起三角至七角，獨甲種稍形不振，午後形勢更佳，永康同康天生樂茂均有買進，丙種再到二元，戊種再到一元，繼以大豐協大潤利及散戶均有賣出，市價再行回鬆，將及收盤時，天生號奮勇抬價，繼之者有樂茂號的協助，丙種乃衝出二元，丁戊種也均衡出一元，表面形勢極為良好，漲風是否一貫有持續性，或仍走曲線，應於今日卜之，總計市價結果，繼續狂漲六角至一元三角，獨甲種較為遜色，蓋其市價，比之其他高六七元，已不為投機家所注意，成交總數共計一百二三十萬元之譜，茲列簡明表如下：</p>

<p>昨日現金金條暗盤市況，起落範圍仍形狹隘，全日僅七元差度，價則始終盤旋於二千零九十元左右，情勢則先疲後堅，初因上日午後的疲風未息，且某錢兌業代客幫忙賣出百餘兩，後以外匯略帶軟化，加以金號與某銀樓相繼吸購，故價頓時由低步走高，結果較上日午收下跌一元，各方人心平穩，交易頗清，銀樓飾金依然呆滯，海關金亦仍未變更，中英純金均見略升。</p>

<h3 id="e124">Bank of Japan Frequently Absorbing Forward Foreign Exchange <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market initially appeared calm yesterday, with foreign firms engaging in some hedging, but foreign banks were generally willing to supply. However, the Bank of Japan suddenly began frequently settling forward contracts for both British and American currency, gradually softening the market. There was little change throughout the morning, and trading was light. The Hong Kong exchange rate was relatively robust due to significant hedging by foreign firms.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the London long-term rate was up 0.0625 for both near and forward dates, and the New York silver price remained unchanged. The London gold price rose half a point, with the exchange rate at 3.125 for pound against dollar, down 1.25 against French Franc, and unchanged against Shanghai. The rate for dollar against pound was down 3.125, the rate against French Franc was down 6 centimes, and unchanged against Shanghai. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening selling prices in the morning were 8.28125 shillings for British pounds and 16.1875 yuan for US dollars, with no change from the previous day's closing rates. After the opening, foreign firms engaged in some hedging, but foreign banks were generally willing to sell, keeping the market calm. Some foreign firms settled British pounds at 8.265625 shillings and US dollars at 16.15625 yuan with Dutch, Chinese, and Chartered Bank. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listed prices remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax was announced at 5%, calculated at 8.50%. Subsequently, spot trading was scarce due to changes in supply and demand. However, Japanese banks frequently absorbed forward contracts for both British and American currency, causing the market to soften slightly as foreign banks' willingness to sell diminished. Near noon, foreign firms purchased Hong Kong dollars at 55.375 yuan from Overseas Chinese and Chinese-Italian firms, tightening the situation slightly. By the afternoon closing, the bank's selling prices were 8.1265625 shillings for British pounds and 16.15625 yuan for US dollars, resulting in a 0.015625 shilling strengthening of the pound and a 0.03125 yuan softening of the dollar, with the Hong Kong dollar also up 0.125 yuan. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>According to reports from the production area, the inventory of Jinshan squid is exhausted, and the stock in Hong Kong is also nearly sold out, resulting in a severe shortage of spot goods here. Consequently, Jiangxi and Ningbo merchants are continuously purchasing, driving up the trend. Red plate sales opened at 100 yuan per dan, but the current market price for transshipped goods has already reached 110 yuan, and imported goods are being quoted as high as 120 to 125 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Yarn and Cotton: High Cotton Prices, Some Still Bullish on the Yarn Market <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Flawed by too Many "Football" Trades</p>
<p>The yarn market, which had been weak for several days, showed signs of rising yesterday. Due to high cotton prices and thin profit margins for manufacturers, some are bullish on yarn prices, leading to active trading for speculative purposes. As soon as prices dip, buyers rush in, but actual trading remains sluggish. Although there is much artificial activity, the foundation is not solid. As soon as prices rise slightly, sellers appear, and the rebound is quickly reversed. In short, without actual demand to support it, the market is unlikely to rise significantly. Relying solely on human manipulation, with sudden inflows and outflows, is like a football game, with players kicking and catching, buying and selling from each other, which is unlikely to last long. In the afternoon, due to weak actual sales, the market weakened again, falling by 5 jiao.</p>
<p>The current yarn market situation is as follows: The market initially opened with a slightly upward trend, rising by 5 jiao, carrying over from the good performance of the previous day. The single-price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 391.5 yuan, with 10 bales traded among peers. Soon after, the price fell back to 391 yuan. Then, due to a rumor that a certain company had no sell orders, the market suddenly became nervous. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 394.5 yuan, and after a fall of 3.5 yuan, it immediately rose by 2 yuan to 395.5 yuan. However, customer sales were not strong, and trading in the afternoon was normal. Asking prices loosened, with both spot and warehouse receipt prices for Double Horse yarn falling by 5 jiao. Nonetheless, buying and selling among peers remained active, with everyone engaging in "scalping" trades. According to statistics, a total of 1,438 bales were traded throughout the day, with the average price rising by about 1 yuan. The price of thread rose by 2.3 yuan. Manufacturers did not take action. Today, 70 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Hong Kong, 355 pieces to Xiamen, and 79 pieces to Fuzhou. Furthermore, 1,660 pieces of yarn arrived from Tianjin yesterday. The transaction volumes for each origin are recorded below:</p>
<p>Peers: 975, Wenzhou: 25</p>
<p>Ningbo: 35, Hong Kong: 63</p>
<p>(Fuzhou): 25, Inland: 120</p>
<p>Shantou: 30, Xiamen: 5</p>
<p>(Tianjin): 40, Tianjin: 20</p>
<p>Hunan: 10, Total: 1,438</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market remained sluggish, with no significant activity. However, northern trading continued uninterrupted, while demand from other areas was flat. The spot price for 20-count Water Moon yarn was 335-6 yuan, and it remained firm. Demand for 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn was lower, with prices as low as 325 yuan, more than 10 yuan lower than Water Moon.</p>

<p>The domestic cotton business was slightly more active, but Japanese factories took no action. However, Chinese factories were interested in purchasing raw materials for coarse yarn. Xin Yu and Hong Zhang factories purchased 4,000 bales of Yao cotton, and prices reached new highs. Transactions for graded cotton also increased, but asking prices continued to rise. Supplies at the wharves increased slightly, but the volume was negligible, totaling 259 bales on wooden frames and 450 bales of white-wrapped cotton. Furthermore, 900 pieces of Yao cotton arrived from Ningbo. The quantity and market prices of current cotton transactions are listed below:</p>
<p>Sea-raised Tip: 71.00, Traded among peers: 100 bales, Cash warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Yao Cotton: 66.00, Xin Yu factory purchase: 2,000 bales, Wire transfer warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Yao Cotton: 67.00, Xin Yu factory purchase: 1,000 bales, Wire transfer warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Yao Cotton: 66.00, Hong Zhang factory purchase: 1,000 bales, Wire transfer warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Tollies: 95.00, Traded among peers: 150 pieces, Wire transfer warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton: 71.00, Traded among peers: 100 bales, Cash warehouse delivery</p>

<p>Fire Machine Cotton: 70.00, Yuan Xingde purchase: 500 bales, Cash warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market had seen prices rise for several days due to the possibility of the Smith cotton proposal being implemented, with domestic and foreign manufacturers fearing it would be difficult to purchase raw cotton before the new cotton season. However, due to complications with the Smith proposal, various industries have lost interest in the cotton market and are taking a wait-and-see approach, resulting in a rather stagnant cotton market. As a result, prices fell by 4-5 points. The Indian market was closed, with predictions of a 1 rupee drop. The Egyptian market was flat, with mixed gains and losses. Yesterday, exchange rates loosened, translating to a drop of 7 jiao per dan for American and Brazilian cotton, 6 jiao for Indian cotton, and over 1 yuan for Egyptian cotton when converted to legal tender.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading has been very quiet lately. Shen Xin is interested in purchasing lower-grade American cotton, but due to loan cotton issues, there is a very small supply of this cotton in the American market. Despite sending telegrams to the United States several days ago, they have been unable to find any. Yesterday, there was only one transaction by He Feng, purchasing 400 bales of American cotton at a delivered-to-factory price of 78.5 yuan. No transactions were reported by other factories. Yesterday's foreign cotton prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Raw Material, Category, Delivered to Factory Including Tax</p>
<p>60-count Egyptian Cotton, Superior, 110.25</p>
<p>Also, Middle, 107.35</p>

<h3 id="e128">Grain: Flour Floods In, Prices Gradually Loosen <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The flour market continued to be stable yesterday. Since the mainland suppliers have been active, trading has gradually become more lively, but the North China suppliers have remained sporadic. This is because of the abundance of imported flour in the region, making it difficult to expand the need for Shanghai flour. The South China suppliers are also limited by shipping space, with only a few thousand bags traded per day. There has been no special activity in sales within the city. According to news from foreign firms, Shanghai grain merchants have recently ordered a total of 1.5 to 1.6 million bags of US and Australian flour. Of this, 400,000 to 500,000 bags have been shipped, with over 1 million bags yet to arrive. As a result, the prices of imported flour have been gradually loosening recently, with medium and lower grades falling by several points. However, the prices of local flour mills remain at the original price of 4.7 yuan for first-grade flour, 4.6 yuan for third-grade flour, and 4.3 yuan for fourth-grade flour. There is little supply or demand for fifth-grade white bag flour, and no agreements have been reached. Yesterday, 300 bags of flour were shipped to Ningbo, and today another 4,000 bags of flour and 3,000 bags of bran will be shipped to Fuzhou, and 350 bags of bran to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The wheat market has been consistently quiet, with no formal transactions taking place. Mills are focusing on ordering foreign wheat and do not rely on local wheat, effectively turning the market into a world of foreign flour. It is also reported that the price of wheat delivered to factories from Jiangbei is 7 yuan, while a certain party is buying the same wheat at a high price of 7.45 yuan, which is not considered a formal market price.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Du Geng Rice Stable, Medium and Lower Grades of Ke Xian Rice Gradually Softening <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of 3,000 to 4,000 bags of He Xia Third Grade rice arrived from various sources, transported by truck. Since the market fell back two days ago, sellers' sentiment has strengthened again. However, sales within the city have been sluggish, resulting in mixed price movements for thick and thin geng rice. Some medium grades fell by a few points to 0.1 yuan. Du Jian rice softened slightly, while foreign superior grades remained stable, and Bian Yuan rice was similar.</p>
<p>The supply of Ke Xian rice has been very strong for several days, and merchants are eager to sell, while hoarders dare not store for long. Yesterday, due to competition among various parties, the market fell another 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The price drop attracted inquiries from local merchants and re-exporters, resulting in a total of 4,000 bags being traded yesterday. The supply of high-grade rice is relatively small, and owners are unwilling to sell too cheaply, while medium and lower grades are relatively flat and soft.</p>
<p>The price of imported rice is still between 17.5 and 18 yuan, making it difficult to approach new orders. As a result, existing stock is relatively active. Saigon Number One rice was sold at 17.1 yuan to 17 yuan. Small-grained rice, which was only 12.5 yuan last week, also rose to 13 yuan yesterday. However, with the gradual fall of local rice, only a few hundred bags were traded.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the oil market rose due to consecutive increases, a shrinking exchange rate, and reports of insufficient shipping space, which led to concerns that the oil sold by commercial transporters could not be delivered on time. This boosted confidence, but the increase was not as sharp as in the past. Prices consistently rose by another 0.5 to 0.6 yuan. In the spot sales market, suppliers from the Yangtze River region were quite strong, and demand from the inland rivers was also not weak. As a result, futures prices continued to climb under the promotion of both insiders and outsiders. The total market saw 200 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil and 50 pieces of warehouse-interlocked raw oil traded (priced at 32 yuan new regulation), 200 dan of spot soybean oil from factory oil, 100 pieces of Yantai oil, small and large 200 baskets of Lianqi oil, 300 plus barrels of spot Dalian oil, 100 barrels for March delivery, 600 barrels for April, and 400 barrels for May.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 100 pieces of soybean oil arrived from Yantai, and 1,000 pieces of skin oil arrived from Ningbo. Today, 100 pieces of soybean oil will be exported to Xiamen.</p>

<p>Yesterday's yellow bean market was good due to continued high oil prices and improved sentiment. Export activity for Chongming sand yellow beans also increased. Market prices saw gains, with 2 truckloads of spot Dalian beans traded at 8.42 yuan, a slight increase of 0.02 yuan from the previous day. Over 1,000 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans were traded at 8.45 to 8.5 yuan, 80 bags of Zhangyan Du beans at 8.4 yuan, and 6 truckloads of Dalian beans were contracted for April delivery at 8.33 to 8.35 yuan.</p>
<p>Today, 1,870 bags of beans will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Silk and Tea: A Word of Advice as Silk Prices Rise Again; Do Not Sacrifice the Silk Industry Through Speculation <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market clearly moved from stability back towards firmness. This publication has repeatedly pointed out that the current silk season's objective and subjective conditions are indeed favorable for rising silk prices. However, the price should not be excessively high or diverge from the actual sales market; otherwise, silk prices will inevitably fall. The sharp decline in the past two weeks was precisely due to the market situation at that time contradicting the above principle. It was not that silk prices themselves (the phenomenon promoted by supply and demand) could rise indefinitely at times of high prices or plummet at times of low prices. The reason why the reporter is reiterating this reason today is because, in light of the previous rise and fall of domestic and foreign silk prices, the speculative fever in Shanghai's silk industry not only prevailed in the past but also continues in the present. This kind of speculation not only brought domestic and foreign silk sales to a standstill but also sacrificed a lot of capital for expanding silk reproduction due to participating in short-selling and long-buying on the New York and Yokohama exchanges. It is hoped that they can turn back as soon as possible so that the silk market can return to the right track.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Yokohama silk market rose by 20 yuan in the morning session, and closed up 15 yuan in the afternoon session, with forward prices up 22 yuan. The afternoon session closed up 5 yuan. New York's near-term prices rose 0.04 points, and forward prices rose 0.035 points. Japanese silk prices for 83.75 points rose 0.02 points each, and Shanghai and Guangdong silk prices each rose 0.01 points. The local market had already stabilized in the previous session, and yesterday's sentiment also turned bullish. After the B-mark White Factory Silk was sold at 1,720 yuan, the asking price rose back to 1,800 yuan. However, silk transactions were even quieter. No transactions were made by local or foreign White Factories. Only White Top Foreign Firm bought over 10 dan of Ji Li Xia Gan and other grades.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Sugar Market: Both Domestic and Foreign Sugar See Slight Declines <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend for Dutch sugar was flat and soft. The association's marked prices were 0.1 yuan lower for spot No. 24 coarse sugar at the external warehouse, at 24.6 yuan, and 0.8 yuan at the local warehouse, with Big Money Mark at 25.1 yuan. Transshipped No. 24 coarse sugar was at 16.5 yuan. Taikoo refined sugar remained stable, with B-mark Eastern Warehouse delivery at 24.625 yuan, with a previous transaction, slightly lower by 0.025 yuan. The Western Warehouse was still asking for 24.7 yuan. Local factory cotton sugar was 0.2 yuan lower, with Zhenji No. 1 at 24.6 yuan, and the rest remained the same. No. 1 local ice sugar was 0.1 yuan lower, at 33.2 yuan. Transactions for graded prices remained quiet. The Chaozhou suppliers offered over 100 bags of superior white powder at prices of 24.2 to 24.3 yuan, and 50 bags of Tie Qing at 15.5 yuan. The Jian suppliers offered over 200 bags of Diao Qing at 14.6 yuan, slightly lower by 0.02 yuan from the previous day.</p>

<p>Market Prices Drop 10-20 Yuan</p>
<p>Recently, the supply of Xiang lotus root from Hengzhou has increased, while demand from Guangdong and Hong Kong suppliers is extremely low, relying only on local trading. As a result, the market price has been difficult to maintain, falling by about 20 yuan compared to the red plate price. The superior grades are relatively poor. Yesterday, top-grade Xiangtan lotus root was asking for 100 yuan, followed by local Hunan lotus root at 92 yuan, Jiuxi lotus root at 85 yuan, and Hengzhou lotus root at 70 yuan to 65 yuan.</p>

<p>Watermelon Seeds in Short Supply</p>
<p>Recently, watermelon seeds have been in short supply, leading to repeated price increases. For example, the higher-priced Dalian seeds once reached 30 yuan, and the trend has since stabilized. Beiwang seeds opened at 43 yuan, and yesterday another batch of Tushan seeds was offered, totaling 70 bags, priced at 41 yuan, an increase of 1 to 2 yuan from the previous day.</p>

<p>Since the war, the supply of domestically produced coal has been cut off. Most of the coal used by factories in the city comes from Hongji in French Indochina, Karkata in British territory, and Australia. Japanese coal also accounts for about 40%. Yesterday, a foreign firm had a new shipment of Songpu bituminous coal loaded, with a total of over 10,000 tons, including previous inventory. It was entrusted to a certain merchant for sale, with the overall coal priced at 39 yuan per ton, screened coal at 41 yuan, and briquette fines at 37 yuan, ex-warehouse, with handling fees extra.</p>

<p>The inventory of new galvanized wire on the market is insufficient, so the market price is excellent. Recently, there has not been much production from Japanese factories, and no new goods have arrived, resulting in an unusually thin supply of circulating goods on the market. The market trend has rebounded again. For example, coarse patterns are being offered at around 21 yuan per dan, medium-grade patterns are also being offered at around 19 yuan, and fine patterns cannot be purchased for less than 22-23 yuan. According to inquiries, over 300-400 dan were offered on the market yesterday by the guild, purchased by Fuzhou, Tianjin, and Yantai suppliers.</p>

<p>Shantou reported that galangal is in short supply, with local prices rising to 17 yuan per dan. Recently, the appetite of various local suppliers has been strong, so dealers have been uniformly holding firm. Yesterday's sales rose by 2 yuan and are expected to continue rising.</p>

<p>National cloth suppliers from Zhejiang and Jiangxi continue to be strong in fine cloth, and sentiment remains firm. The factories' forward prices are 0.1-0.2 yuan higher than the market price, and the amount of goods on the market is in short supply. Suppliers from Wenzhou, Shaoxing and Ningbo purchased over 100 bales, and asking prices continue to rise by 0.05-0.1 yuan per bolt. Fine materials from Shen Xin and Xin Yu factories are relatively firm, while the coarse cloth market is stable. Zhejiang buyers purchased over 200 bales of Yihua 14-pound cloth. Spot goods of coarse twill cloth are lacking, and market prices are gradually increasing. Min Yu factory's 16-pound Farming and Fishing brand cloth has increased factory prices to 15.5 yuan. Guangdong suppliers purchased over 100 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, poplin, colored cloth, and colored twill. Zhejiang and Jiangxi suppliers purchased about 200 boxes of bleached cloth, bleached twill, poplin, and other light-colored fabrics. The Fujian suppliers' registration of manufacturers has passed, and cloth shipments have been suspended for over a month, causing fear of shortages in the area. After the authorities temporarily allowed the products of over 30 factories to be transported and sold, and after further review, purchases have been particularly strong recently. Yesterday, over 500 boxes of bleached cloth, poplin, colored cloth, colored twill, and printed goods were shipped.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Dong cloth white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill remained soft. The lowest price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 11.725 yuan per bolt. Later, due to the dyeing factory's strong interest and a shortage of spot fine twill, prices rose by 0.05 yuan per bolt. Although asking prices for fine cloth were still mixed, about 1,000 pieces of spot and forward contracts were traded, and prices rose sharply. The highest price for Dragon Head fine cloth was 11.85 yuan. The dealers did not offer goods, and the northern suppliers only added sporadic amounts. Compared to the previous day, the high-grade brands of fine cloth and fine twill rose by 0.05 yuan per bolt.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 200 pieces of textiles were shipped to Ningbo, and today 410 pieces will be shipped to Fuzhou, 380 pieces to Xiamen, and 55 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Easily Treated Neurasthenia vs. Difficult-to-Treat Neurasthenia <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Yang Daonan, a graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Neurasthenia is a very common condition with numerous symptoms, which can be broadly divided into three types: brain neurasthenia, sexual neurasthenia, and spinal neurasthenia. For example, headache, poor memory, insomnia, palpitations, dizziness, etc., all belong to the former. Nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, infertility, kidney deficiency, thin and weak sperm, pale complexion, etc., all belong to the latter. Other symptoms such as back pain and sore bones belong to the latter.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, neurasthenia progresses from shallow to deep, so if you become aware of it, you should treat it immediately to restore your health. However, this condition has no clear boundaries. Sometimes, those suffering from neurasthenia also suffer from brain weakness, insomnia, forgetfulness, etc., and also suffer from back pain. The source of the disease is due to the deficiency of essence and blood.</p>
<p>Excessive busyness, overwork, or being subjected to job loss and economic pressure can lead to neurasthenia. However, if the cause of the disease can be eliminated, health can be naturally restored. Therefore, sometimes the disease can be cured completely without medical treatment or medication. For example, if a person who has been unemployed for too long obtains a job, they will feel mentally comfortable, and their neurasthenia can be reduced. In addition, excessive self-gratification, debauchery, and sexual injury after marriage are the main causes of neurasthenia. After self-gratification, seminal emission appears, and essence and blood are greatly reduced. The brain, spinal cord, and sexual function are all affected, leading to extreme physical and mental weakness.</p>
<p>The most effective treatment for neurasthenia is endocrine therapy, which uses the essence from animal testicles to supplement the human body. This is the most advanced new invention, and it is very simple and effective. Patients can purchase and take the genuine testicular essence preparation for men, "Bu Ti Kang", three times a day, which has the three major effects of nourishing the brain, kidneys, and blood. The effect of the drug starts in one hour, and it generates essence and nourishes the kidneys in 24 hours. In addition, dietary therapy and electrical therapy are also necessary, but the effect is not as good as actively taking "Bu Ti Kang". However, during treatment, masturbation should be abstained from. For those with nocturnal emission, "Nai Er Si Nocturnal Emission Tablets" can be taken to stop it. For women with infertility, irregular menstruation, and unhealthy breasts after marriage, taking "Bu Ti Kang" for women can have a rejuvenating effect. This has been proven in my clinical experiments. Most of the similar preparations on the market are not good, and they have large side effects on the gastrointestinal tract. Only "Bu Ti Kang" truly has its purported effect, and taking it regularly can truly have a rejuvenating effect.</p>

<h3 id="e143">The Most Standard Leukorrhea Medicine <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is a disease that comes on very violently but is not easy to cure, causing patients to suffer greatly. They recklessly try all kinds of medicines, hoping for a quick recovery, but the results are always disappointing. The treatment of gonorrhea is indeed a difficult matter and cannot be treated casually. This responsibility can only be undertaken by treatment methods prescribed by experienced doctors. Unfortunately, most gonorrhea patients do not know the harm, and abuse inferior medicines on the market, turning what could have been a quickly cured gonorrhea into a difficult one to cure. The key to the fundamental solution of gonorrhea lies in whether the choice of doctor and medicine is appropriate, which is the secret to curing gonorrhea. Particular attention should be paid to internal medicine for gonorrhea, as it can give many economically disadvantaged families the opportunity to be completely cured.</p>
<p>However, finished medicines on the market are springing up like mushrooms after rain, making it difficult for patients to choose. According to my experience, only "Kelinnong", invented by Dr. Peter of Germany, can defeat all the unreasonable finished medicines on the market. "Kelinnong" has been personally tested by the most authoritative gonorrhea experts in the world, proving that it has unique success in gonorrhea. This is because "Kelinnong" has an anti-gonococcal bacteriophage effect within a few hours after taking it, so it actually has a practical effect within a few hours. Secondly, the bactericidal effect of "Kelinnong" is thorough. Ordinary internal medicine for gonorrhea has a blunt effect and only reaches the superficial part. If the gonococcus has escaped into the deep and widespread areas, then ordinary finished medicines will have no effect. Thirdly, the drug is the kingly way, so taking it guarantees no adverse side effects. Due to the above advantages, taking "Kelinnong" is always beneficial. For all gonococcal prostatitis, orchitis, urethritis, cystitis, arthritis, etc., it is effective in a short time. For external use, men can use "Anti-Lin Water" and women can use "Ka Er Xue Di Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories, which will have a faster effect.</p>
<h3 id="e144">The Darkness and Rescue from Seminal Emission and Premature Aging <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Ting, German Doctor of Medicine</p>
<p>Seminal emission is a symptom of excessive indulgence. Almost every masturbation sufferer experiences nocturnal emission from time to time. If indulgence continues, the body becomes even weaker, seminal emissions become frequent, and emissions occur even without dreams. Sometimes, even diurnal spermatorrhea erupts. When the condition reaches this point, there is no doubt that the body's health has been lost, so timely treatment is advisable. In addition, some people under the age of forty feel dizzy and experience back pain after slight exertion. This is due to excessive sexual activity, or hardship and overwork. Although they are young, their bodies and spirits appear unusually withered, leading to the loss of lifelong happiness, and they are unlikely to live to old age. The only way to save the above two symptoms is to first abstain from masturbation, avoid excessive physical and mental exertion, and regulate sexual life. Then, actively take "Buti Kang," a preparation of testicular essence from strong animals for men, to replenish the body's insufficient essence and blood. After a considerable period, the brainpower will be invigorated, and the sexual power will become stronger day by day, which indeed has the effect of delaying aging. At the same time, "Nai Er Si Seminal Emission Tablets" should also be taken to strengthen the seminal gate and stop seminal emissions.</p>
<h3 id="e145">How to Subdue Tuberculosis <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Doctor of Medicine Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is a terrible and chronic disease. Treatment takes a long time and requires a lot of money. Therefore, some people say that tuberculosis is a disease of the rich, meaning that only the rich are qualified to have this disease, and the poor have no way out but death. But that's not actually the case. Regardless of any lung disease, based on my years of experience, "Bu Fei Na Er" is indeed an effective agent for controlling early and mid-stage lung diseases. This agent has the effect of eliminating the oxygen in lung disease, causing the lung disease bacteria to lose their activity. Therefore, hemoptysis, chest pain, night sweats, and tidal fever caused by tuberculosis all disappear quickly after taking it. It can also relieve cough and resolve phlegm without surgery, and can repair lung cavities. Major European and American sanatoriums and experts all instruct patients to take this agent at home.</p>

<p>Gonococcal toxin is an extremely virulent toxin. Once it invades our reproductive organs, all tissues are wantonly destroyed by the gonococci, and the reproductive function is inevitably affected. This is unavoidable. To give the most important example, once a gonorrhea patient develops gonococcal orchitis, reproductive power is greatly affected. This disease usually develops two or three weeks after gonorrhea infection and is caused by the transfer of posterior urethritis. Or, it may be caused by neglect of health care during the chronic period and the misuse of inferior drugs, which reduces resistance and advances the disease. The disease often starts on the right side, hence the name epididymitis. The initial symptoms are general fatigue, aversion to cold, poor appetite, pain in the groin, and frequent urination. Then, there is a sudden onset of severe testicular pain, fever, testicular prolapse, and constipation. At this time, appropriate treatment must be given, otherwise there is often a risk of hydrocele, purulent wounds, and rupture. Unfortunately, if this disease occurs, fertility will definitely be affected.</p>
<p>Originally, the testicles are important organs for producing sperm. If these organs are lost, the reproductive element is exhausted, and there is no hope of fertility. Even if not, reproductive power will be reduced, and marital love cannot be maintained for long. I once treated a patient named Zhu who also suffered from acute orchitis. His right testicle was swollen and prolapsed, and there was a tendency to invade the left testicle. The situation was dangerous. He came to me for treatment in a hurry. I used a specially made testicular support belt to support his prolapse. I also used the gonorrhea medicine "Ke Lin Nong" and static electricity therapy. After about three weeks, the pain stopped and the swelling subsided. He was completely cured in about four weeks. According to Mr. Zhu's illness, if he had delayed for another two or three days, the infection would have invaded the left testicle, and the treatment would have been more difficult!</p>

<h3 id="e147">A Small Understanding of the Czech Problem <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>Modern Europe has become a boiling pot, truly "one wave has not subsided, another has risen." Just as the Spanish Civil War seemed to be coming to an end, the second division of Czechoslovakia has matured again. Whether the future result will be high heat and a boiler explosion cannot be predicted at present, but this trend has indeed taken shape, and perhaps there will be such a day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Slovak and Ukrainian peoples simultaneously declared independence. Such a major issue that transforms world history will of course have special works or major articles to discuss its background and process. Now, I can only briefly record some feelings here to contribute my humble opinion.</p>
<p>I feel that in the European situation, Germany and Italy are completely on the initiative, while Britain and France are in a passive position, and other countries are even more in a passively passive position. Not only that, Germany and Italy have comprehensive plans with each other, and each also has entire plans: what attitude should be taken towards a certain country or matter, when to launch, when to end, what is the purpose, how to proceed, ... everything is analyzed in detail and without omission. Truly "knowing yourself and your enemy; advance can attack, retreat can defend." Unlike Britain and France, which are usually lax and confused, and panic when they hear an alarm, at most they can only treat the head when it hurts, treat the foot when it hurts, and be humiliated by others.</p>
<p>This situation was the case in the past, and it is still the case now. In the past, they had to hastily move to be taught, and signed the Munich Agreement. Now, the ink of that agreement has not yet dried, and such a major change has occurred, and there is no way to think for a while, so they can only comfort themselves and say, "Because certain conditions have not yet been implemented, ... Britain and France have no reason to interfere." Hearing their voices is truly pitiful!</p>
<p>Secondly, I feel that if the evil forces of fascism are not extinguished early, they will become more stretched in the future. Because the conditions for the survival of fascism are external aggression. In the future, the weak will be annexed, and the strong will rise up to emulate. This is an inevitable result. However, it seems that it is not possible to rely on Britain and France to extinguish it.</p>
<p>Perhaps Chamberlain and Daladier are burnt out and will never dare to meddle in other countries' affairs again. Then we can only wait until they demand the division of colonies to see their colors.</p>
<p>The water is boiling, the pot is hot, and perhaps demanding colonies is the final straw!</p>

<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>Life on the battlefield. I don't know where so many fleas come from. Whether I sleep on the ground or on the table, I am always bitten so that I can't rest for a moment every night. I have worked all day, and at night I should rest quietly, but I am just busy scratching here and there, and my whole body is swollen with itchy and painful bumps. This makes me suffer so much. I sigh, I resent, I hate these fleas for having the suspicion of being traitors who help the enemy! It is easy to deal with the enemy, but I simply have no way to deal with these fleas.</p>
<p>I have endured several nights in a row, probably because I am too tired. This night, I curled up my feet and lay down on that short table, and fell asleep snoring. But just as I was sleeping sweetly, suddenly, a voice was calling me:</p>
<p>"Li Qiao! Li Qiao!"</p>
<p>I was awakened by this annoying voice. But I still covered my head with a gray felt and lay there without moving. I still hoped to sleep a little longer. I did not answer the voice calling me. "Qiao Qiao! Li Qiao! - It's your turn to patrol!" Hearing that last sentence, I could no longer pretend to be asleep, so I jumped up:</p>
<p>"What, it's my turn to patrol again?"</p>
<p>"The first shift patrol has returned, of course, it's the turn of your second shift."</p>
<p>There was nothing to say. Although the two bloodshot eyes were not so open, although I really hoped to sleep a little longer, I could not abandon this task, so I hurried to put on my clothes ...</p>
<p>It was raining heavily outside the door. The sound was loud, and strong green electric light shone in from the crack in the door from time to time, making people a little dizzy.</p>
<p>The sound of guns and cannons was ringing fiercely in the sound of the rain, especially the sound of the machine gun was so tight and clear, as if the enemy had already hit outside the door.</p>
<p>"Hurry up and go out with your guns, listen to the sound of the guns! ..."</p>
<p>In this urging sound, the three of us shouldered our guns, braved the rain, and walked out of the room.</p>
<p>The ground was full of puddles of mud, looking like pieces of white stones. Stepping towards there, boom - the mud splashed up, and one foot was already soaking wet.</p>
<p>In a short while, my head and body were soaked. Raindrops flowed down my face like sweat. We leveled our guns with bayonets fixed, preparing to stab the bayonets into the chest of the enemy who suddenly attacked! But nothing could be seen clearly on the earth. Only the willow trees outside the village stood like giants. The wheat seedlings in the field turned into a vast black sea.</p>
<p>The foot of Yushan Mountain, which was chaotically ringing with the sound of guns and cannons, and the Yushan Mountain, which looked so beautiful during the day, was swallowed by the Black Sea. Only the buzzing bullets were densely intertwined in the darkness ...!</p>
<p>We dragged our clumsy big feet covered with mud and struggled to slide on the muddy dirt road. Suddenly, a voice was thrown from the front where no one was:</p>
<p>"Who is it?"</p>
<p>"Patrol team!"</p>
<p>"Password?"</p>
<p>"Advance!"</p>
<p>"No? -" The voice became very stern, followed by the sound of loading bullets: "Who are you after all?"</p>
<p>Seeing that the other party seemed about to shoot, we also loaded bullets into the chamber and pressed the trigger tightly with our index fingers - but we knew that the other party with the Yunnan accent was not the enemy, he must have misunderstood us. But how to resolve this misunderstanding? Many tragic things in the world happen on misunderstandings, could it be that we ...</p>
<p>"We are the patrol team of the 184th Division, how are you ...?"</p>
<p>"I am also from the 184th Division!" The other party suddenly became a little more gentle: "But your password is wrong!"</p>
<p>"What is your password?"</p>
<p>"Effort!"</p>
<p>"Oh, that was for the first half of the night, how come you -!"</p>
<p>"Was that for the first half of the night? Why didn't they come to change shifts? - Oh, sorry, I almost fought myself!"</p>
<p>Our sentry seemed to feel an incomparable shame. But we did not blame him. When we silently passed by him, we glanced at him. He was also like us, without any rain protection, his whole body was soaked. But he stood there so valiantly.</p>
<p>"Comrade, aren't you cold?"</p>
<p>"Aren't you cold either?"</p>
<p>"We - hahaha ..." We laughed.</p>
<p>"Haha ..." He also laughed.</p>
<p>We walked away. The annoying rain suddenly became heavier, and the sound of guns and cannons also became lively. We opened our tired eyes and silently walked, walked ... waiting for dawn!</p>

<h3 id="e150">Saving the Nation Is Not Reviving the Past <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Bo</p>
<p>It seems that someone has criticized that there is also "anti-Japanese eight-legged essay" in the anti-Japanese literature. I have not yet understood what that means, but I think this term is not used very well at all. However, there is indeed a tendency to revive the past in some aspects of our national salvation literature.</p>
<p>If this tendency cannot be considered a good tendency, I think it is really necessary to criticize it.</p>
<p>Not to say too far, we had the national crisis at the end of the Song Dynasty, and the national crisis at the end of the Ming Dynasty. Those painful histories are worth reviewing and excavating. But our current national crisis is not the national crisis at the end of the Song Dynasty or the national crisis at the end of the Ming Dynasty after all. The enemy in front of the Song Dynasty was the Mongols, the enemy in front of the Ming Dynasty was the Manchus, and the enemy in front of us now is Japan with airplanes and cannons. Since the reality is different, the literature that should respond to this reality is naturally different. We should naturally recite the works of anti-enemy heroes at the end of the Song Dynasty and the works of anti-enemy heroes at the end of the Ming Dynasty. However, if we also want to write that kind of work now, it is a bit inappropriate. Of course, national salvation literature is comprehensive, but this comprehensive should be a modern comprehensive, that is, the comprehensive of the immediate reality, and not necessarily drag some old patterns to be considered comprehensive. - Of course, I am not saying to abandon history.</p>
<p>It is also possible to give concrete facts. For example, when writing poetry, it seems that old poetry has suddenly become popular since the Anti-Japanese War. It is true that some people who cannot write new poetry, as long as they stand on the anti-Japanese side and can write some good old poetry, it is also worth our praise, but that effect is limited after all. But if people who have always written new poetry actually put down new poetry and keep turning to old poetry, even if they really express the spirit of the Anti-Japanese War and really write well, it still cannot but be considered a phenomenon of regression. The result is not only not comprehensive, but I am afraid that it does not even occupy half of it. Furthermore, for example, reprinting ancient books of national thought, needless to say, that is the most important task, but even if it is for emergency, some finishing procedures should be spent. If it is not punctuated, not divided into paragraphs, and no necessary annotations are added, but just printed as it is, although it is better than not printing at all, the meaning will be reduced a lot.</p>
<p>This seems to be only in terms of form, but it is not simply a problem of form. If you don't believe it, suppose there is a declaration now, although the content is anti-Japanese, but it is written in Rao Hanxiang's "four-six" style, try reading it. The problem is: national salvation literature or anti-Japanese literature does not only count if it says something about national salvation or anti-Japanese War in a subjective way, but it must also have the effect of propaganda and the effect of education in practice. And precisely in order to have these two effects, it is necessary to use a lively form, - a form that modern people can generally understand.</p>
<p>It seems that a certain newspaper once introduced a newly published "Yu An Hate Biography," which is said to tell the story of Chen Yuanyuan, and is a masterpiece written from the perspective of saving the nation. Naturally, to say that it is national salvation literature, no one can deny it. However, although I have not seen that book, but as far as I think, even if that art is above "The Peach Blossom Fan," the meaning is far less than the works of Hu Shanyuan's "Biography of Righteous People of Jiangyin" and "Biography of Righteous People of Jiading." The reason is very simple. We need living historical stories to propagate to the public, and we do not need "refined" legends that only a few people understand.</p>
<p>Making "refined" works, the content is still inseparable from saving the nation, this kind of "personal matter" seems to have the right to exist. - If you want to say that, there is naturally nothing wrong with it. But now this kind of "personal matter" seems to be less and less. A face full of snow cream has nothing to do with saving the nation; but wearing a ceremonial cap and wearing pink-soled boots can only revive the past, and it is difficult to save the nation.</p>
<p>But I must declare one thing: I am criticizing only the tendency to revive the past, but I am absolutely not opposed to the adoption of popular old forms. Old poetry is by no means popular songs like "Five Watches Tune," and legends are by no means popular dramas like "Bouncing War." And even when using popular old forms, some finishing procedures should still be spent.</p>

<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>"I ... I don't have ... have that much money!" Yang Yueliang was so frightened that he stammered.</p>
<p>"Humph! Why tell lies in front of real people! Who doesn't know that you have hidden silver at home!" The one-eyed Li sneered and immediately told the officer through the translator that Yang Yueliang had hidden silver at home. The officer immediately ordered his subordinates to search the house up and down.</p>
<p>Yang Yueliang's heart was just jumping wildly in his chest. He only knew at this time that without the protection of the national army, private property could not be protected, but it was too late for him to realize it. He stared blankly inside, and it was only when the X army soldiers who went to search came out empty-handed that he felt relieved.</p>
<p>However, the X military officer refused to let him go and insisted that he tell the location of the hidden silver. Yang Yueliang was unwilling to say it. The X military officer was furious and ordered his subordinates to hang him up. On the left beam of the hall, there was originally a thick hemp rope, which was used to tie the scale pivot of the Sima scale for weighing rice when collecting rent. At this time, his left thumb was used as the scale pivot and hung up high. His body was originally fat, and it was unbearable to use a thumb to maintain the weight of the whole body. He screamed like a pig being slaughtered, but he still refused to reveal a word. The X military officer ordered someone to burn his armpits with fire. Yang Yueliang could not bear the pain and had to tell the truth that the silver was hidden in the cellar under the bed. Only then was he let down.</p>
<p>Not long after, the hidden treasures were unearthed and piled up into a small white mountain in the hall. Before, Regiment Commander Ye also knew that Yang Yueliang had hidden silver and had advised him to take it out voluntarily or sell it to the government at the market price, because raw gold and silver were very useful to the country. However, Yang Yueliang mistakenly thought that he was coveting his hidden silver and refused with one word, saying that he had none. Who knew that it would be seized by the magic hand now. Yang Yueliang watched his property, which had been accumulated by many years of hard work, turn into flowing water. He could not help but suffer a sudden attack of pain in his heart and became insane. He screamed and jumped around in the hall and reached out to grab the X military officer. The X officer pulled out his pistol and, with a bang, ended his life.</p>
<p>Of course, there were still people who died as humbly as Yang Yueliang, but more people died heroically. Since the X army occupied Hepu Town, the town has added many chaste women and martyrs, including those who refused to be raped and were stabbed to death by the X army, those who were afraid of being raped and committed suicide by throwing themselves into the river or well, and those who hanged themselves in shame after being raped. But the most heroic death was that of the wife of doctor Yu Chunan. On the night Hepu Town fell, an X army soldier who was drunk broke into the door, wanting to rape her. She knew that she could not avoid it, so she pretended to agree, led him to the back window, suddenly hugged him, and jumped into the river under the window. The X army soldier fell into the river and struggled to climb up, but she held him firmly and did not let go. Finally, both drowned in the river.</p>
<p>The people in Hepu Town secretly regarded this incident as a good story. The next morning, Jin Chunan fled from Hepu Town and went to join Regiment Commander Ye. He vowed to avenge his wife. (Three or four)</p>

<h3 id="e152">The Change in China's Status in Hollywood <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday and Today Are Very Different; Humiliating Chinese Films Have Been Swept Away</p>
<p>Since the Anti-Japanese War, China's international status has increased a lot. This point can be seen from the fact that the American film censorship authorities absolutely prohibit scenes with insulting Chinese nature. In the recently produced film (Red Barry), a Russian slapped a Chinese man on the head. The film censorship authorities cut out the entire scene because it had insulting Chinese connotations. Also, in the film (Wells Fargo), Chinese coolies no longer have ugly braids and are equal in status to white people. In American films, whenever Chinese servants are filmed, a white servant must be included as a foil. If this regulation is violated, the film company will be severely punished with "suspension of filming for one year."</p>
<p>In addition, the Hollywood film industry also has a good impression of China day by day. Various film producers have taken the story of China's Anti-Japanese War as a script, and they have fully adopted the opinions contributed by Chinese actors. Film producers used to think that Chinese people were either living a life of drunken debauchery or were stupid. Now this concept has been completely eliminated, and the status of Chinese actors has also become very different from yesterday.</p>

<p>— She Weng</p>
<p>It is not easy for Southerners who learn Peking Opera to pronounce accurately. For example, the words "qian" (front) and "qian" (money), people in Suzhou must sing like Qi's pronunciation; especially when female roles speak Peking dialect, they often think that they will make jokes if they don't relax a little and take it seriously. I once heard a Southern amateur sing the Princess in Visiting Mother, and when she read the sentence "... report to the Empress Dowager to get your head," she made the word "yao" (want) into the word "yao" (bite). The listener mistakenly thought that the princess was biting the head of Lang. Another opera teacher said: I once met a Suzhou person learning to sing Selling Horse. The word "ma" (horse) is always close to the word "ma" (scold); in order to match the pronunciation of his dialect, I ordered him to sing the word "mai" (buy) directly, and it was indeed able to be forced to be the same.</p>
<p>The play Entering the Palace Twice is a Zheng Gong opera that emphasizes singing for male, female, and Jing roles. It seems that there is no distinction between the original and the supporting roles. Only when the skills are equal can it be tight. If one is slightly weaker, the whole thing will be loose. Someone said that the later duet singing is not without taking off from this. However, how can the so-called duet be as wonderful as it is! Even with the singing section of the three people in this play, it is considered perfect to not give way to the board and take over. Otherwise, it will be inferior. Also, the second section of singing by the female role must still sing the slow board. Those who sing the original board are cutting corners. I once heard Wang Xichun broadcast on the radio without singing the slow board, and the listeners criticized it. Recently, I watched Guan Shaohua perform this in Tianchan. The female role Xue Youqin was able to abide by the rules, and I had to admit that she was better than Wang.</p>
<p>On the stage, actors are most afraid of drummers, because success or failure must be tied to them. However, there are also those who embarrass the drummers. My friend Yu Jingmei said that the female role Zhao Zhixiang had a grudge against the drummer. One day, she performed Puguan. In the scene of offering incense and praying, after reading "Holy," she continued to read the word "Holy" twice in a row. After which word the drummer thought he would start singing, he played a duo point, but unexpectedly it collided with Zhao's second Holy, which made him extremely embarrassed, and the drummer finally succumbed to it.</p>
<p>Huang Guiqiu played Gou Huisheng's script Lantern Festival Riddles, the whole body is the same, only changed one or two in the singing sentence of the female role, and changed Erhuang to Xipi, and deleted the Sipindiao. The theater propaganda, the so-called difference from the ordinary performance, is probably this. This play was compiled by me and Mr. Zhang Mingfei. The general copy was published publicly in the Compilation of Huisheng by Mr. Zhang Zhenyu, which was published by the General Assembly in 1927. I once discussed with Chen Moxian to revise the unsatisfactory scene. Now Huang is still the original, which is not enough to satisfy my hope. Huang's performance in this play is not fully matched to her identity and imitation of personality, it can be seen that what kind of play is suitable for whom, or not suitable for whom. Huisheng, among the four famous female roles, is short in voice, but for the sake of fitting the plot, when encountering sad emotions, she uses Erhuang. Now Guiqiu alone denies it, it seems that she has failed to increase the audience's emotional interest. Huang's voice is rich and abundant, I don't know what is the intention of abandoning Erhuang.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Theatrical Community Joint Association is soliciting members to sponsor refugees. The donation books from all troupes were submitted to the association the night before last. Yesterday, the association sent committee member Lu Wenyi as a representative to attend the team leader meeting of the citizens' fundraising group at the Atlantic European Restaurant. He reported on the fundraising results. The amounts pledged by each troupe over 100 yuan were the Great Stage Theater and the Co-Stage Theater. Over 90 yuan was the Shou Ju Society. Over 50 yuan were the Wing On Company's Tian Yun Lou Peking Opera Troupe and the Tianchan Stage Theater. Over 40 yuan were the Carlton Grand Theater, Xu Pinji, and Shuang Yu Tang. Over 30 yuan were the Great World Peking Opera Troupe, Xiang Xing Society, and the Queen's Theater. Under 30 yuan were the Yin Yun Department, Chang Le Theater, Huxi New Stage, the Great New Company's Peking Opera Troupe, the Sincere Company's Children's Peking Opera Troupe, Zhou Xinfang, the New World Peking Opera Troupe, the New New Company's Peking Opera Troupe, and the Carter Grand Theater. It is said that the Xin Ji Great Stage Theater sisters, Han Suqiu and Han Suolan, are about to leave the troupe. The association invited female impersonator Jin Mudan, but her younger sister had already accepted an engagement with the Gengxin Stage, so it did not work out.</p>
<p>Co-Stage Theater's female impersonator Xiao Linghong suffered from a severe throat ailment but has now recovered. It is said that she will return to the stage last night.</p>

<p>The number one fat man in the movie industry is Yin Xiucen. Watching him walk with his swaying demeanor, one can sense the glory of "unrivaled in the world" and "I am the only fat one." According to him, he was pitifully small in his childhood. Unexpectedly, he suddenly became fat one year, and became fat in a rather strange way, causing all the family members, young and old, to seek divine help and divination, suspecting that he was suffering from dropsy. Now Yin Xiucen is definitely fat. Because of his fatness, he often feels annoyed. The reasons are: eating a boxed lunch requires paying for two meals; making a Western suit requires six yards of material; buying a stiff collar requires ordering a thirty-inch one; and riding a rickshaw requires paying double the fare. When he was studying at the Tianjin Film School, the students rarely had the opportunity to meet as a whole. Perhaps because his name "Yin Xiucen" sounded like a woman, he received many love letters one after another. The love letters were all sent by male classmates. The letters started with "Dear Ms. Xiucen" and ended with "Dear Sister Xiucen," and then went on to write a lot of nauseating lines like "I love you," which simply made Yin Xiucen laugh like an Amitabha Buddha.</p>
<p>Shen Xiling's nickname is "Monster." His strangeness lies in the lack of rules in his life. He doesn't like going to the barber shop for a haircut; he doesn't like shaving; he doesn't like washing his face; he doesn't like washing and changing shirts; he doesn't like washing his feet; and he doesn't like having a fixed time for eating and sleeping. Because of all this, others gave him the nickname "Monster." However, why is he so romantic about life? The reason is very simple: because he loves art, because he is loyal to art, he has spent all his time and energy on the work he is engaged in, so he has to forget everything about himself!</p>
<p>Now everyone knows that there is a Ren Jinping in the business world, but this old Ren was a strongman in the film industry many years ago. This gentleman can be said to be China's only idealist. He always carries a briefcase around, and that briefcase does not contain any business that has been done or needs to be done, but plan after plan. However, his fate is not good, and his plans are rarely realized. He often tells people: "You see, I'm much older, right? Yes, this plan has cost me a lot of effort and brainpower again."</p>
<p>Xu Zheshen, who has been broadcasting on the radio for many years, was originally a veteran of the old literary world. He wrote good chapter novels, and his poetry is not bad either. Because he read too many books when he was young, his eyes became nearsighted, and now it has reached two thousand degrees. When he wears glasses to read the newspaper, his nose still often rubs against the newspaper. He is very intelligent, but he doesn't know how to make phone calls, doesn't know how to take streetcars, and can't figure out the roads in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Wang Manjun, one of the three main characters of the Emerald actor Chen Xian, is called "Old Brother" by everyone, because of his innocence, just like a child. He doesn't distinguish between good and bad in everything. Sometimes, when people say a few words to him honestly, he thinks he has been criticized, and he immediately pulls a face and says angrily: "Bad luck, bad luck, I've been criticized again."</p>

<p>Lu Ming had previously acted in several films in which "she herself never died in the ending." But in "Fallen Women," she performed "death" for the first time, and died very tragically, not of old age or illness, but by taking sleeping pills. This shows that this play is quite miserable.</p>
<p>"Six-Way Tram" is Gong Jianong's first work to appear on the screen after returning to Shanghai. He has many small movements and expressions, making people laugh and cry. According to him, he recently learned this from other places.</p>
<p>Bai Yun, this big kid, has a beautiful face and a suave demeanor. He partnered with Lu Ming as soon as he appeared on the screen, jointly acting in "Fallen Women." His expressive skills have formed a unique style. This man has a lot of hope for the future.</p>
<p>Lu Ming was raped for the first time in "A Romantic Ghost." This time she suffered the same fate again, and it was also after getting drunk, just like the first time. In this way, alcohol can be said to be the enemy of Lu Ming and a group of young ladies.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Li Jirui became famous for seven and a half plays</p>
<p>There is a saying, "A short person speaks loudly." In the theatrical profession, there are indeed many people who can prove that this saying is very correct. Like Wang Guifen, Li Jirui, Hao Shouchang, Lao Shuangchu, and Xiao Dazi, these people are all short in stature but have very loud voices. Among the above-mentioned people, Li Jirui's height is even shorter and his voice is even louder. When he stands on the stage, even though the soles of his boots are very high and his body is straight, in the eyes of ordinary audiences, they always think that he is like a child running around on the stage. Jirui knew that he was not suitable for long-bearded roles, and he had not put in the effort to study and hone his martial arts skills, so the plays he performed throughout his life were mostly wearing arrow-sleeved jackets, mandarin jackets, and hero costumes. When it comes to the several martial arts plays that he has enjoyed great fame for, it really feels pathetic. According to people who are experienced in opera, they estimate that he has only seven and a half plays in total, which created his title as a successor of the Huang school. This is too much of an official for him. The names of his seven and a half plays are "Dumu Pass," "Copper Net Formation," "Assassinating Bajie," "Chain Set," "Luoma Lake," "Inviting Song Ling," and "Wind and Waves Pavilion." The other half of the play is "Cui Ping Mountain." The reason why this play is only considered half a play is because this boss Li does not know how to wield the knife in "Killing the Mountain." Every time he posts this play, he either does not bring "Duan Shan" or he co-performs with another martial arts actor, and this martial arts actor takes over the "Killing the Mountain" scene. Therefore, it can only be considered half of his masterpiece.</p>
<p>In the past, the theaters in Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin) used to have good actors for all roles: sheng (male), dan (female), jing (painted-face male), and chou (clown). The ticket prices were also especially cheap, and the top actors would only perform for a maximum of ten or eight days in a row before being replaced by other actors. Therefore, people like Liu Hongsheng and Li Jirui were able to make a living with just seven or eight good plays. Later, Shanghai theaters sent people to the north to invite actors, and dozens of people would come at once. The travel expenses were a large sum, and when they arrived in Shanghai, they had to prepare comfortable accommodations and sumptuous meals. After adding it all up, they had to perform for a month or two in order to make a profit from the actors. Therefore, as long as ordinary actors came to the south, they had to sign a one-month contract, plus help out with the four Sunday daytime performances and the farewell commemorative performances for ten or half a month. In this way, the actor would have to know forty or fifty plays in order to avoid leftovers.</p>
