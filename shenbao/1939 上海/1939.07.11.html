<h3 id="c4">觀測東京談判 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>英日兩國爲了天津日軍封鎖英租界問題，半月前即經決定在東京談判；當初我們評論，以爲此項談判，必然「曠日持久，遷延不決；」到現在，時隔半月，談判尙未開始，完成更不知將在何月何日；我們不以談言微中而沾沾自喜，却以前途黯澹而惴惴不安。</p>
<p>英國要把天津問題的範圍，確定爲地方事件；不但英國朝野直接間接一體如此表示，并且透露了些微妙的外交法術。其意蓋謂日本若同意於本問題是地方事件，則英國當然樂於圖謀解決；不然，牽涉美法兩國的利益，英國無權單獨與日本作何決定；換一句話說：日本若要擴大天津問題的範圍，則英美法三國便得合力與日本周旋。</p>
<p>在日本方面，則曾說過，必須英國接受日本所提廣泛的原則，即是英國必須變更其態度，放棄其援華政策，不然，東京談判決無結果；但是解決糾紛的具體條件，當然以天津問題爲主。假定我們不算神經過敏，則體味所謂必須如何如何，是陪襯，是反面文章，而所謂具體條件以天津問題爲主，隱然接受英國主張的「地方事件」原則了。</p>
<p>英日兩國的外交素質，歷來均以陰柔著稱；祗有去年日本對蘇聯解決張鼓峯事件，英國對德國簽訂慕尼黑協定，比較的十分乾脆，這是例外。惟其陰柔相尙，加以歐洲的國際形勢，遠東的政治醖釀，在在有使雙方多具幻想的資料，故英國所提地方事件原則無論終究如何貫澈，亦不夠遽稱東京談判的前途爲樂觀。但看日本當局一面悄悄地說解決條件以天津問題爲主；一面却又在日本國內及在中國的軍事佔領區域內，製造了好多齊整的，機械的反英運動大會，大吹大擂，轟轟烈烈，儼然民衆一心，氣燄萬丈，夠使政治的鄉愿聞之氣餒，望而却步。可見日本政治家雖不以爲東京談判乃有何種意外收穫的希望，但仍不管有效無效，儘所可能的搬演法術。到了昨天，還用非正式而不負責任的方式宣傳，所謂對於東京談判的基本政策八項：（一）要求英國改變其關於政治及經濟各方面之政策；（二）要求英國承認東亞新政局；（三）將天津英租界中之反日恐怖份子與共黨份子悉數引渡；（四）接受日警與日憲兵之合作，以維持和平與秩序；（五）英租界禁止法幣流通；（六）移交租界中屬諸華人銀行之五千萬元白銀，（七）承認日方有檢查華人銀行及兌換店之權利，（八）禁止並遏阻反日宣傳。這眞是集討價之大成，是開始談判前數夕的重要姿勢啊！</p>
<p>我勿正像一部份如英國政治家的感想一樣：例如英國前首相勞合喬治氏，前日在英國衛康爾地方演說，他說英國關於天津事件，已成爲歐美間的一大笑柄，又說英國內閣已失去其頭腦；諸如此類的表示不滿意與不安心，甚多甚多，決不祗勞合喬治氏一人而已；有時候，我們覺得同樣不滿意與不安心。但是根據一般道德，根據一般理智，我們又以爲張伯倫內閣必不致於一再失信，使人一再失望。張伯倫內閣曾經用强毅的口吻，聲明英國外交政策決不接受默書式的命令；這當然不是說僅僅不接受德國命令，却例外的願意默日本書。但是日本要英國默書八項之多！</p>
<p>我們深信英國對於東京談判，決不視爲練習默書的機會；同時又希望英國深深體認，日本或以開放長江日英合作等等爲餌，使英國姑且默書，則全部中國人對英國的心理怎樣？由反動而促成的惡感比較他種惡感又怎樣？至於超過地方事件範圍的談判，英國不得不邀的美法兩國共同周旋；這在英國或以爲日本所不願冒此不韙，於是爲了顧念日本而代爲設法避免共同周旋的實現；其實戰事經過了兩年，英法美三國出而對日共同周旋，安知不即是解救了日本欲罷不能之局；至少以遠柬大局爲觀點，允必有安定遠東的功能。英國若能對此深深體認，我人允深信東京談判更有意義。更有貢獻了。</p>

<h3 id="c30">英法海陸空將星　雲集星洲會商聯防　對應付遠東方策有重要決定　官方僅稱所有協定均屬一致　美荷對大會密切注視 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>新嘉坡通訊，爲保護遠東權益而召集的英法遠東聯防會議，雖然國際關係使美，荷兩方沒有正式派遺代表參加，但實際上，兩國與英法完全採取同一的步驟。所以，這會議，說是英法遠東防務聯席會議固可，說是民主國遠東聯防也無不可的。</p>
<p>會議於六月二十三日起在新嘉坡舉行。參加的代表，會前宜佈爲六十名，英法遠東海陸空軍重要戰將都參加，但會議舉行時，正式出席者僅四十四名，相信其餘十幾名是參謀部秘書職員等等，會期本來是一星期，但事實上只舉行五天便宣吿結束。縮短會議時間的原因，固然由於（一）法國參謀部及其代表團準備工作完善。（二）大會未舉行前會舉行預備會，使會議順利進行，迅速無阻，而天津英租界被嚴密封鎖，日軍於會議期中進佔汕頭，予英法權益更大的威脅，時局益形緊張，不得不早爲準備，也爲會議提早結束的重大原因。</p>
<p>此决會議純屬秘密性質，在陸軍軍營內之體育館中舉行　，由兵士站崗把守，非代表概不能進入。但，因其具有特別重要性，不但日本，德國表示注目，全球人士均莫不注目，故英文報記者仍然多方設法採訪。會中主席爲英國駐遠東海軍總司令諾貝爾上將，彼以指揮得法，應付裕如，予各代表以良好印象，允其是軍略上的高超學識，對遠東寄特問題有奇特把握，更令代表欽敬。自二十二日晨開始後，直至二十六日宜吿結束，這五天當中，每日上午開全體大會，下午分海陸空三小祖委員會進行，至傍晚六時方才完結。星期日也舉行數小時會議，那緊張的情形，是不難想像出來的。</p>
<p>日軍侵佔汕頭消息，由路透社記者傳達與會中各將領後，曾引起重大注意，衆信關於英法如何應付日軍在華橫行問題，必有重要討論與决定。如何防止日本南進，會議的第三夭，曾熱烈討論，認爲日本佔領瓊崖與斯巴特萊，和在馬來亞西面各小島成立漁塲或共他方式之根據地均不可忽略，最後有重大决定，特別是北婆羅洲的油塲的保護方法。</p>
<p>暹羅的態度如何，會議中也予以最大的注意。暹羅在馬來亞，緬甸與安南等地之間，握有遠東决戰的鎖鑰的地位，自然是不能不注意的。會中曾由緬甸政府空防部顧問比施奧報吿暹方眞正的態度。比兼任暹羅之空軍參贊，情形較爲　悉、大的暹方與英國傳統的友善關係，直至今日還未動搖，雖日方曾極力勸誘，要暹羅投進法西斯陣營中，但事實上，暹羅仍然被目爲如歐洲的比利時，一般預料還羅在大戰時，必然站在英法這一邊的。</p>
<p>總括來說、從有關方面探悉，會山曾有下列的八項重要議决：（一）英法兩國駐遠東海陸軍統一指揮問題，總司令由英駐遠東海軍總司令諾貝爾上將担任，總司令部設在新嘉坡。（二）英法兩國軍械與資源，在戰時合併。（三）起草作戰計劃，並先硏究日本海軍優點，以便開戰時應付裕如。（四）安南金蘭灣海軍根據地，山英法兩國合力積極改建爲「法國之新嘉坡」軍港。（五）保衛英法在華各租界辦法。（六）保衛遠東英法商輪辦法。（七）保衛遠東交通綫辦法。（八）英法兩國與暹羅美國荷印之相互關係。上述八項，有位記者詢之當地防務情報處處長賓登少將，彼不能應允負責證實。</p>
<p>不過，大會在臨閉幕時，曾發表佈吿，內容是會議於二十六日終結，閉幕後，諾貝爾氏即乘旗艦趕回駐紮華北海面，報上所載一切關於會議情形，俱不外揣測之詞，概非負責常局正式供給者，惟本會議關於一切問題的應付方策，所達到之恊定，均屬一致云云。這公佈令，是官樣文章，但爲供讀者參考，合併報導於此。</p>
<p>會議與美荷的關係，公開部份有將會議結果，隨時通知該兩國當局，據當地英文報所得電訊，美國報章對是决會議，皆以極大篇幅登載，美國在菲創辦的馬尼拉報更於會議開幕日發表社論貢獻意見，荷印方面，吧城某荷文報特派記者來新嘉坡採訪大會新聞，吧城人士且主張選派要員與大會聯絡。另又有一種傳說，謂荷方重要將領曾利用假期到新嘉坡，與各將領會晤，交談防務問題。其實，荷與美對大會的密切關係，可於「會議决議案通知美荷」一語窺見之。</p>
<p>諾貝爾上將，原定二十六日離星，終延至二十七晨始動身。原因：在等候前往英國向海軍部報吿太平洋防務工作的澳洲海軍總司令晤談。新嘉坡中英文報均這樣預測，英國對日採取彈性態度，將於諾貝爾到中國海後得到證明。（逸生）汕頭特的通訊，英法駐遠東之海陸空高級長官，在星洲軍港開會，應付遠東危急之局勢，事前開會地點，絕對保守秘密，在星洲康寧山總司令部舉行，外傳在肯特旗艦，或在東陵兵營，皆係推測之詞，當廿二午開會之時，路透社消息，關於日軍進佔汕頭，日軍限英美艦，下午一時退出汕頭之耗，已送達會議席上，各代表極爲重視，鑒於中國沿岸形勢嚴重，曾討論日海軍封鎖大陸問題，及應付之辦法，會塲附近，派出陸軍一營，戒備森嚴，直至廿六日該會始圓滿閉幕，遠東艦隊總司令諾貝爾，駐華陸軍總司令賈乃錫，廿七日乘肯特艦離星，七月一日午前十時抵港，因此决會議關係甚爲重大，特從某方所得消息錄下。</p>
<p>到會代表</p>
<p>茲將兩方代表團名單列下，海軍代表，英國方面，英國遠東海軍總司令諾貝爾上將英國遠東海軍總司令部參謀長麥格里俄副少將，英國遠東海軍總司令旗官馬特生上尉，英國遠東海軍總司令秘書兼司庫麥布里上校，英國遠東海軍作戰部參謀長齊菲里士少校，英國遠東海軍情報部長波特少校，英國遠東海軍總司令部參謀長秘書德里多中尉，英國駐華艦隊官威廉士中校，英國駐華艦隊空陸部長塞里多上尉，東印度陸軍總司令代表錫蘭軍事專員巴敦上校，馬來亞，海軍提基德魯副少將，法國遠東海軍總司令德古斯中將，法國遠東海軍總司令部參謀長在安上校，法國遠東海軍司令旗官巫蘭農上尉及巫羅英上尉，馬來亞陸軍總司令魯比少將，馬來亞軍事指揮部斯達特旅長，馬來亞陸軍參謀長美爾士上校，馬來亞陸軍情報部長文寧少校，馬來亞陸軍部海軍副組委員會代表菲生士少校，馬來亞陸軍部空軍副組委員會代表巴馬，英國駐華軍隊總司令格拉塞特少將，英國駐華陸軍參謀長威伊少將，緬甸陸軍總司令密洛里少將，及其副官華力華上尉，印度陸軍部作戰兼情報部副部長亨達生上校，安南陸軍總司令馬丁中將，及其參謀長拉加里上校，副官郭民安上尉，安南陸軍參謀弗蘭雷上校與德特爾上校，空軍代表，英國方面，印度空軍司令菲特上將，英國遠東空軍司令巴民頓上將，英國遠東空軍高級參謀安德魯隊長，緬甸空軍顧問兼英國駐暹羅空軍參謀比索隊長，英國遠東空軍情報部長瓦里指揮官，及其參謀特寧拉指揮，英國遠東空軍部海軍副紙委員代表馬蘭曼隊長新嘉坡空軍副委會代表亞爾剛候補少校，法國遠東空軍高級參謀畏德維斯上校，及其參謀南波里上尉，右列官員皆係英法駐紥遠東之軍事要員，極爲熟悉遠東之戰略形勢與戰爭據點者。</p>
<p>會議程序</p>
<p>英法速東軍事聯防會議，散佈四圍保護之武裝部隊的一營有奇，情形至極嚴肅緊張，會議之初步程序已完畢，原則上决定要英法二國在遠東之軍事合作，據稱此决會議將不涉及他國政治問題，常局曾作正式宣佈稱，此决會議程序的如下數端，（一）英法在遠東戰爭時之最高司令問題，最高司令經决定由英國遠東海軍司令諾貝爾上將擔任。（二）英法遠東軍事力量之合作問題。（三）海空軍之互助保護彼此領海與領空。（四）飛機塲與軍港之互助借用。（五）聯合保護二國，在遠東之商業運輸，該會議確與遠東及太平洋上之美，荷，澳，有密切關係，雖均未派有正式代表參加，但會議之進展情形，皆用非正式方報吿各該國當局，該會議主要題，爲分配各小組委員會，及其人選問題，但在原則上則已達到英法遠東軍事之絕對合作，惟會議之內容常局絕對保守秘密，在大隊武裝部隊保護之下，任何人均不得接近會議地點，故外間鮮有知者，並謂此會最大任務，使英法在遠東與敵國發生戰爭時，將發揮最大之效能，最低限度，亦須完成下列計劃，（1）應付日本乘歐洲多事之時，單獨壓迫遠東列强，（2）考慮歐戰一起，遠東必定激起戰爭之可能形態。</p>
<p>基此會議，必須考慮如何利用各地方之人力物力，輔以現代軍事設備，配合適宜，增强列國自保之力，减輕歐洲東顧之憂云。</p>

<p>— 周</p>
<p>「不圖私利，不會夫敗，個人始此，事業如此。」這是一訪問秦潤卿先生以後，深印在我的腦海裏幾句警世名言。這裹我把這幾句話首先提出，爲的是希望靑年們加以格外的注意，接受事業成功者的處世良言，奉爲圭臬。雖然我是流着汗跑上幾層大理石樓梯，我覺得道個代價是很可寳貴的。</p>
<p>在南風微拂的一間純中式的客室裏，見到紅木的器具和秦先生辦公桌上的水烟袋，不中得使我油然而生「予生也晚」之感；可是同時叉想到像這樣整潔而富有古意的幽美環境，自也弼覺其可愛</p>
<p>秦先生很謙和的說：予幼年在蒙館入學，家境淸寒，十六歲即離原籍慈谿而來滬就業，後來於學間之道，雖加研練，但仍常感求學的重要，因此十幾年前，就在慈谿創辦普迪小學，冀使一般無力求學者得有讀書機會。近年復摟購古今典籍，在慈谿籌設抹雲樓圖書館，現在已有書籍，計古本的一萬二千冊，近代書籍亦萬餘册，即可公開閱覽。現決定將這部份藏書歸諸社會。於此可見秦先生關心文化敎育之熱切。他說：他生平無特殊嗜好，如果要說嗜好，也祗有訪求書籍一端而已。</p>
<p>他回憶着童年來滬習業的一切，說是到現在忽忽已四十八年了，對於生活程度的高漲，繁華市面的發達，他雖不加可否，可是語氣之間，對於一切的現狀，是含有無限的感慨，祇有他「敬業與樂業」的情緒，表現出他的樂觀和興奮。他在談話中彷彿把蒼蒼白髮遺忘了，而回憶到天眞的靑春的童年時代。他是始終在昔年的協源即現在的福源錢莊執業，不但毫不厭倦，而且對於本業的服務，久而彌篤。我想，這是秦先生成功之道，同時也是目下靑年們見異思遷的當頭一棒。</p>
<p>他生平爲錢業興革致其全力，民國十一二年聶雲台先生和他，祖任上海總商會正副會長，他竭力主張要成立圖書館和商品陳列館，終以由他們兩位手創觀成。他在錢業是唯一的元老，同時對於錢業的公益，也是無役不與，這是大家都知道的，在這裏，是無庸贅述了。</p>
<p>銀行事業勃興以來，錢莊業似乎因爲業務大致相同，不免遭受了業務發展的限制，這點感想，我是在未訪問秦先生以前希望提出來和秦先生硏討的。見了秦先生以後，覺得福源的組織保管庫等等的設備，或者資本較淺的銀行，還沒有他的規模，於是錢莊自有存在的理由。這個思想，在我的腦海中，勃然長大起來，繼續的我就拿錢莊的前途，希望秦先生加以闡述。（未完）</p>

<p>有人說：「人生就是苦惱！所以嬰兒由母胎中出世時，首先就是呱呱地哭聲！」這雖是宗敎家的說法。但世間男女確有許多，把好事弄成壊事，尋歡變爲不歡，於是怨天允人，不勝其悽慘者！男女相悅，夫婦之愛，照理當是人生最快樂的事，可是因爲生殖腺內分泌的虧損。男子常有滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，發育不全，神經衰弱等症。則雖有花容月貌的美眷，在此香艷肉感的夏季，雖逢塲作戲，亦每使幸福像輕煙似的幻滅着，或竟完全無能爲力，頃刻間所殘餘的不過是憎恨與憂傷而已！</p>
<p>據醫學上的論斷，男子生殖腺的所以虧損，大都由於早年犯有自凟遺精或荒淫縱慾，把生殖腺液耗費太多，則上述各症，即難倖免。在前醫學不甚昌明之時，許多醫生對此種症象，旣鮮知其癥結所在，治療上亦每束手無策。惟自十九世紀生殖腺內分泌學大放光明之後，知道生殖腺內分泌在我人各期生活中均有着獨特的功能，在幼年時，凡狀貌重量的發育，差不多完全爲所操縱。在春情發動期後，除營生殖作用之外，其內泌素隨血液灌漑全身，功能促進發育，調整新陳代謝，幷滋養腦，脊髓，一性各部神經，所以影響於我人一發育，健康，壽命，品格，愛一情，優生者實至重且巨。</p>
<p>近頃關於生殖腺內分泌療法，已獲得驚人的成功。奧國醫聖歷經三十餘年之艱辛實騐，由雄壯動物如猿猴，猩猩，熊鹿等體中提取其生殖腺素，用科學方法複製成劑，即名「生殖素」屢經試騐，無不其效如神，所謂藥對如開鑰，誠然是也。幷經世界千萬名醫證明、此藥於服後二十四小時內，即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，繼續服用半月可助長發育，調整新陳代謝，上述各症無不根本痊愈。長服更可延年益壽，中老年人可收返老還童之功。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精」（永安先施西藥部及中法中西五洲等各大藥房均售）以固精關，制止遺洩，則標本兼治，收效允速！</p>

<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>照生理發痛的常態，靑年人應當有豐富的頭腦充沛的精力，因此思考力辦別力決斷力，日新月異，進步不已！這種靑年才是社會的瑰寳，民族國家未來的主人翁。不過，當今的青年殊有出於我們意料之外者，十之八九面黃肌瘦，思想遲鈍，讀書桌地鴻鵠將至，做事時沒精打采，似不勝其疲備者！在性機能上每有滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，發育不全，神經衰弱等症，性慾最易衝動，終日惟尋花問柳，為時代女郎識破了，失戀痛苦層出不窮！即在夫婦生活上，因腎虧衰弱，亦常為威憎恨，家庭陷於悲慘境地！</p>
<p>好好的靑年何爲而弄到這步田地，據醫學上的論斷，大都為早年犯有自瀆縱慾，招致遺精，而復遺精失治，使生殖腺內分泌液枯竭，則上述各症即勢難避免。此外如先天衰弱，病後失調，以及用腦用力過度而有上述症象者，則比較的少。我人旣明瞭其致病的原因。在治療上即較易為。據世界名醫及余經驗均以服「希米脫氏固情片」以固精關，制止遺洩為治標之唯一對症特效療法。同時服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補其腦腎精血，神經幷助長其發育，作爲治本之唯一對症特效療法，能標本兼治，必可於短期恢復美滿健康。</p>
<p>患者唐榮華君，靑浦人，二十六歲在學生時代會犯自凟，繼起遺精。半年以後，腦力極度衰弱，夜晚有失眠盜汗現象。中學勉強卒業，未能升入大學，一年前結婚，因有早洩陽萎，房事殊覺困難，興起索然，而腦弱益劇，乃求治於余。即囑其服「希米脫氏固精片」「生殖素」並同時施行電療注射，經一月之悉心治療，已完全康復，頃者唐君聞在某小學任敎，夫婦愛情彌篤，生活殊爲幸福云。</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>『二分容貌七分裝』，這句話我根本不大贊成，而且也有些不近情理，試問：一個面容枯搞，顴骨高聳，眼眶深陷，身軀瘦弱，臀部尖削，胸口平坦而毫無峯狀隆起者。此種女性，即使呌她穿上最高貴的累絲紗等旗袍，抹粉塗脂，走在路上，我知道不但沒有人會說她漂亮，甚至要當她活妖怪看哩！反之。如果這個女性，面目秀麗，骨肉停勻，臀部豐腴，胸前高聳着一對彈性豐富的乳峯，在行動時，微微地現着一起一伏，那她就是亂頭粗服，不施脂粉，自然而然也會有一種至高無上的健美姿態，從她的上下四週襯托出來。並不因爲她的沒有打扮，而稍形遜色，所以「裝」我認爲僅是牡丹上的一些綠葉，美的主要點，還在自己本身。如本身上有了缺陷，如乳峯萎癟，臀部瘦削，面容枯槁，健美喪失者。唯一的挽救方法，祇有立即以馳名全球的生殖腺卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』爲培補。蓋此劑係由前奧國聖醫斯丹那博士積三十餘年之艱辛實騐發明。服後一日夜間即可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，消滅子宮障害。如繼續服用，必可使萎　的乳峯，逐漸高聳，瘦削的臀部，日見豐腴，那時面頰嬌艷，曲線明顯，雖不穿華貴的衣服，担保妳出入交際塲中，自會似衆星之捧月，有人來尊敬妳，愛護妳，熱烈的追求妳，妳眞可以左顧右盼，享盡幸福。</p>

<p>淋病療法，至最近而有新的進展，面目爲之一新。考淋病之纒綿難愈，其傳染力又異常强大而迅速。故流行極爲廣泛，尤其在繁盛之通都大邑中更爲流行，其勢力猛烈，均有逾於洪水之汜濫。且其受害，不僅限於本人，而且傳染其妻子，遺傳其子孫，誠所謂毒流三代也。今因淋菌療法上有新的進展，此種猖獗之淋病，已有遇止之勢。蓋科學未昌明時代，以爲淋病係尿道間之病，故其治法，亦不外於洗滌尿道之局部手術。內服之市上雜牌成藥，亦不過利尿爲目的，且大多有副作用，要知淋病在急性時期，固然可以一鼓蕩平之。但是淋毒已侵入內部，生理上之組織漸趨繁複，淋菌隨處可以逃竄，則局部手術治療與一般成藥，欲求殺菌驅淋，仍不免撲空，毫無實際上之效用。故此等療法，早已成歷史上之陳蹟。而最進歩之療法，以德國最新發明之濾淋平流電療法，確爲理學上療法之一大進展，亦爲淋病療法進展中之代表，歐洲各國醫院之最進歩者，莫不有此電療之設備，他如德國希氏血淸，自家菌苗，斐氏攝護腺按摩法等，均爲現代科學進歩後，在淋病療法上具有高貴而最權威之特殊療法，較之一般市醫與劣藥，真有天地之判。　診時　上午九時至六時止星期下午停診。</p>

<h3 id="c115">果哉所謂「中國醫學藝術論」（上） <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 宋大仁</p>
<p>幾年之前，中醫氣化論和中醫哲學論，也曾哄動一時；但不久即遭新醫界科學界的嚴重駁斥，揭發謬誤，遂消滅於無形。自經戰亂，醫事論壇，沉寂已久；社會人士，亦不暇注意及之。近見張鳳先生著有「中國醫學藝術論」一文，發表本刋，因丁濟南君的演辭，（一九三八年十月二十日華北明星報）繼起響應，不啻給予醫界以新的刺　，尤其在中醫設校標準公布實施的今日，更堪重視。張先生歷任大學教職，學問淵博，久負盛名，處於領導青年的地位，其論文思想，自足以影響社會視聽；茲觀其全文立論，頗涉模糊恍惚，殊無明確的界說，似非治學者應取之態度。用敢不揣謭陋，就兩君原文認識錯誤之處，提出詳述，願與吾道同仁及關心人士一商確之。</p>
<p>何謂中醫藝術？</p>
<p>要講「中醫藝術」，就要先講藝術的定義；藝術有廣義的，狹義的，從廣義的而言：凡是含有技巧與思慮之活動及其製作，——如機械工匠建築房屋之類，都呌做藝術，——就是技術的意思。至於狹藝的藝術，是指美的價值之活動，或其活動產物而言，義與美術（Fineart）同，藝術的定義旣經明白，那末「藝術論」之是否成立，就可得而批評了！</p>
<p>張先生說：「中醫是藝術」這個問題，並不是丁濟南先生的創解，在渠漱溟氏所著「東西文化及其哲學」一書裹面，也曾有論及；現在先將梁氏的見解，轉録於下。</p>
<p>「……我們雖然也會打鐵，鍊鋼，做火藥，……以及種種的製作工程都專靠那工匠心心傳授的「手藝」，西方却一切要根據科學，——用一種方法，把許多零碎的經騐，不全的知識經營成學問，往前探討，與「手藝」，工業如此，農業也如此，……絕不僅憑個人的智慧去做，……其實還是手藝，西醫處方，一定的病，有一定的藥，無大出入；而中醫的高手，他那運才施巧的地方都在開單用藥上了。十個醫生有十樣不同的藥方，並且可以十分懸殊。因為所治的病，同能治的藥。都是沒有客觀的憑準的。究竟病是什麼？「病　」在那裹？並不定要考定，只憑空觀的病情觀測罷了。（在中國醫書裹始終沒有講到「病」這樣東西）某藥是如何成分？起如何作用？並不追問，只拿溫凉等字樣去品定，究竟為溫為凉，意見也參差的很。他那看病用藥，那能不十人十樣呢？這種一定要求一個客觀共認的確實知識的便是科學的精神，這種全然蔑視客觀準繩規矩，而專要崇尚天才的，便是藝術的精神。……」——東西文化及其哲學第二章第二六頁。</p>
<p>「……科學求公例原則，要大家共認證實的；所以前人所有的，今人都有得，其所貴便在新發明，而一步一步脚踏實地，逐步前進，當然今勝於古·藝術在乎天才秘巧，是個人獨得的，前人的造詣，後人每覺趕不上，其所貴便在祖傳秘訣，而自然要嘆今不如古。旣由師弟心傳，結果必分立門戶，學術上總不得建個共認的準則。第一步旣沒踏實，第二步何從前進，况且即這點師弟心傳的東西，有時還要失傳，今不如古，也是必至的實情了。……」</p>
<p>——東西文化及其哲學第二章第二六——二七頁</p>
<p>其實梁先生之所謂藝術，即是技術手腕的意思，並沒有十分優美的含義與價值，非指狹義的「美術」而言，况且又是一種混統的說法，又不特指中醫。梁先生已經明說中醫之不是「學」，現在看丁濟南君的原文，確是脫胎於梁氏，但原文後段忽然說「中國醫學即是藝術」，大約以為這樣一來，就很可以動人聽聞了。然醫學當然不是「美術」而是「科學」，丁先生也是曉得的，而偏要說是藝術。我真不懂，說中醫是藝術——技巧手腕——有什麼光榮之處？實在脫不了一般分不清「學」「術」殊途的毛病；要之「中醫」與「中國醫學」絕然兩樣，「中醫」是「人」，「中國醫學」是滿紙荒唐言，所以「中醫藝術」不就等於「中國醫學藝術」，決不可混為一談。張先生更把牠看做「趣味橫生，情感發越，引人欣賞的」狹義藝術，——美術——而要把「中國醫學」與「藝術」兩個名詞聯合起來，就創造了一個什麼「中國醫學藝術論」，想「使絕對的醫學科學論者徬徨趦趄起來，」，非但是笑話，簡直有點跡近胡鬧。立論已謬，自然推闡引證，也無一是處了。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c116">魚肝油之中「維他命」略說 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭鏡人</p>
<p>魚肝油為　科　Gadidae　大口魚　Gadus　Murrhua　Linne，及　G.　Macrocephalus　Tilesins，POlloachius　brandi，Jordan　et　Snylea　等魚之新魚肝臟中脂肪油，再經化學方法除去雜質後所得之金黃色澄清油液，本品向均視之為一種藥劑，但晚近均視之為一般之大衆衆營養物矣，本品所含之主要成分為維他命甲及丁，（Vitamin　A.　C10H30O，Vitamin　D.　C28H44O　）維他命甲為魚肝油中含量最多者，維他命丁次之，依照美國藥典（U.S.P.）規定每公分魚肝油中最少應含維他命甲六百國際單位，維他命丁最少應含八十五國際單位，維他命對於醫療上功用頗大茲分述於次</p>
<p>（甲）維他命甲有治療角膜軟化症，兒童幼年發育障碍，瘠瘦，肝病，胃酸過少等症并可兼外治創傷之用。</p>
<p>（乙）維他命丁有治小兒之佝僂，軟骨，嬰孩痙攣及手足搐搦等症之功用，并可兼補助石灰質之治療。</p>
<p>觀乎上述之功用，可知魚肝油誠為吾人尤其小孩日常保健上不可缺乏之物質，含有魚肝油之　科魚類歐洲及美洲沿海岸均產之，腦威國及丹麥國出產最多。我國沿海各省均無此種魚類出產，故我國醫療上所用之魚肝油，均須仰給舶來。</p>
<p>魚肝油雖對於吾人有莫大功用，惟因其具有一種特殊之臭味，毫不可口易服，且有反胃之虞。但現代科學進步，藥化學家已能利用化學方法，將魚肝油中之維他命甲及丁抽出，或濃縮，製成其他製劑，味美易服，而効力較之原油，尤有過之。因之市上所售清魚肝油，（Cod　Liver　Oil）每每其中所含之有効成分維他命甲及丁，為已經抽出者，吾人若服此種魚肝油，則無絲毫之効果可言，徒白耗金錢及貽誤健康而已。故魚肝油由外洋進口時，應由發賣之藥房，先行檢騐之後，視其結果如何，方能再行出售。否則如不加檢騐即行出售，則有失商人之道德及信用，茲特將魚肝油之檢騐法分別　録之於後；至於魚肝油中維他命之生物力價試騐（Biological　Potency　Test）因非短期間內所能告畢及非一般試騐室中所能施行者，故從略，當另文詳述之。</p>
<p>魚肝油之一般簡明試騐法如次：</p>
<p>（一）本品之比重Specific　Gravity　在25oC時應為O，918-O，927.</p>
<p>（二）本品之酸價Acid　Value　不得過2.5.</p>
<p>（三）本品之所含不　化物質　Unsoponicification　Value　不得過1.5％</p>
<p>（四）本品之　化價　Saponification　Value　應為163-190</p>
<p>本品之碘價　Iodine　Value　為140.180</p>
<p>（六）以本品一滴溶解二十滴之氯仿　Chloroform　中，再加硫酸　Sulphuricacid　一滴振搖後，即呈紅紫色，迅速變為玫瑰紅色，終成為棕黃色。</p>
<p>（七）以本品十滴至十五滴置表面玻璃　Watchglass　上，再加發烟硫酸　Fuming　Sulphurie　acid　二三滴，放置後，即成紅色，以玻璃棒攪拌後，即呈玫瑰紅色，終成為檸檬黃色，（設為他種油類則無此種色素變化，或先成為黃色或藍色不等。）</p>
<p>（八）在一九二五年時羅氏　Rosenhein　及杜氏　Drummond　發現試騐維他命甲之色素反應，魚肝油中加以三氯化砷　Arsenic　Trichloride　test　Solution　後，即呈光耀之青色，但後卡氏　Carr　及派氏　Price　再經研究結果，認為以三氯化銻　Antimony　Trichloride　溶解於氯仿中為試液，其反應生成較之用三氯化砷試液者，尤為靈敏。</p>

<h3 id="c117">治療肺炎之觀察（續廿三期） <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 顧不問</p>
<p>經過血清治療後</p>
<p>死亡率减少百分之五十</p>
<p>最初之肺炎血清（Antipneumonia　Serum）創見於一八九七年，但在一九〇九年之前，尚未充分奏效。後由鈕飛爾（Neufeld）韓德爾（Handel）　氏，配合一種多價血清（Polyvaleut　Serum），從此方臻美滿之效果，而始騐知一種雙球菌（Diplococcus），即為構造肺炎之主體，飽藏禍心，深蓄病毒，潛伏於多型種簇（有如花園中羽扇豆（Lupine）之叢簇）之內。</p>
<p>抗毒血清，由於各型種簇混合而成者，謂之：「多價血清」，但在一九二四年，即多價血清尚未發現之前，曾由斐爾登（Felton）製造一種成份濃密之血清，惜以使用不得法，屢告失敗，以致其名不揚。</p>
<p>惟是抗毒血清之效力，僅及於同種簇之肺炎球菌，故在其他種簇，抗力不多。例如最普通之Type　1與Type　2而言，若以　Type　2之血清，使用於　Type　1之傳染病型，則將完全失效。若以多價血清，不擇種簇，而籠統使用之，殊不知其效力，僅及一部分，卒使效力，不能遍達，宜其結果之惡劣也。</p>
<p>抗毒血清，因有此種特性，故僅適宜於肺炎球菌之確定種簇，始能遏止傳染，效力可靠，因此，務須使用正確之血清，方為合法也。同時，每在病人送入醫院之初，對於痰之細菌，務須加以檢騐，更為不可或缺之事也。</p>
<p>使用血清，愈早愈佳，否則，診斷較遲，易使治療時機之坐失也。若為避免遲延起見，對於病菌之種簇，不加檢騐，而即貿然注射多價製劑，妄冀速達速效者，雖用多量之血清，而所得效力，至為稀薄，結果，莫不失敗。若非特效種簇之要點發現後，勢難挽回血清治療已受損失之價值也。</p>
<p>在大多數肺炎所具者，都屬Type　1　Type　2　Type　3等種簇，各簇血清，各依其Type，而能迅速見效。惟在事實上，並不如是簡單，因為肺炎球菌，竟有三十　Types之多，而其分簇特效之血清，今亦分簇可供利用。不過欲求區別種簇之判明，現已成為考慮之問題，所幸百分之六十，乃為Type　1　Type　2，或其混合種簇。但在一旦遇有其他Type時，必須加以認清確斷，方期血清治療之完成也</p>
<p>近代自從鈕飛爾（Neufeld　沙賓（Sabin）二氏，創作之後，對於迅捷簡單之分簇法，業已進展順利。此種分簇法之化騐，即使經騐較淺之化騐者，亦能在數分鐘內，測知肺炎之種簇，因此，完成早期診斷，穩妥可靠，而得迅捷之特效，更不待言。故其治療良機，由此大增特增，而能達到成功之途徑，洵屬醫學上最為顯著之進步也。</p>
<p>肺炎之雙球菌，平常隱藏於一種密緻之膠囊內，即使顯微鏡，亦不易測見。對於含有肺炎球菌之痰一滴，加上一種特殊種簇之抗毒血清，則在此種膠囊內，發生定型之變化，頓使菌體膨脹發育，而成曲光之現象，其形類似一種毛玻璃</p>
<p>此種膨脹現象（Quelluug　phenomena）在醫學上，甚具特彩，且其化騐，亦甚精細，故其所得結果之正確，萬無一失。因此，特效血清之療法，亦基於此種病菌之Type，而得美滿之佳果焉。（未完）</p>

<p>東洋興師征伐台灣之生番，其遣將之初，駐札東洋之各西國欽使，因知我中國未有准令，碍及萬國公法，均經通諭商民，不得租與東洋船隻及承充軍務。乃令雖下，而美民竟不克以從。於是東人所延之美國人名李珍大，於過厦門時爲美國領事官所擒獲，便即拘押。按李珍大本在美國爲將軍，繼在厦門任領事職，乘暇徧游台灣各島，故於該島形勢，瞭如指掌。及退職回國，取道於東洋，適値東國朝廷正議琉球難民被合灣生番戮殺一事，聞李珍大詳知島內虛實，爰即就之訪問，李珍大即將所畫成之地圖呈上，且詳述台灣利弊，於是東朝延爲參贊大臣。台灣一役，諸事多出其指使。被拘翌日，美領事坐堂審訊，問李珍大曰：「汝曾慫恿東人，使與中國失和，且爲之出謀來伐台灣，此事除中官照會，另有憑可據。台灣生番之地，係屬中國，故此事有碍於中美二國和好盟的。茲將汝押候駐京之美國欽差批文，再行定奪。押候時則當從優相待也。」云云。李珍大辯曰：「吾被東朝舉擇任用，以和意來台灣司事，乃被貴領事所執，大屬寃枉！且又殊慢東洋和睦之國也。」越數日，厦門領事將李珍大押送至上海。李延狀師辯訴，並稱被執之不合法。上海美總領以一千八百六十年美國議院立制，准暹羅中國東洋諸國公使，見有屬民與美國和好之國，或與其國之內民相助爲戰，公使俱可執拿。惟念李氏係受僱於戰前，從輕保釋云。</p>

<p>丁諦</p>
<p>打動那心弦的鍵子，使一個讀者跟著作詛咒，歡樂，微笑，流淚，你往往佈置了一個情感的項圈，給許多的人套上頸項，讓他們體騐你筆下的氛圍，你的靈魂，你的心境，你把那氛圍塗得濃而又濃，比你自己的更濃，更歡樂，更悲哀，正像說謊的誇張一樣，你不正確地把情緒變形，專寫給讀者。爲要激起憤怒的火燄，與光明正義的愛撫，情緒的誇張動機自然是好的，但效果無益的卻是顯然。</p>
<p>描寫一個意念，一組情緒，一團直覺，在紙上變成文字時，無疑都有一個氛圍。「紅豆」「碧梧」是絢爛的氛圍；「時日曷喪，予及汝偕亡！」詛咒的氛圍；「玉露凋傷楓樹林」是簫瑟的氛圍。你寫下所感受的一切，自然也有你特種的氛圍。這種氛圍不管是濃厚，是淡薄，你都應該照實寫，寫下你的詛咒，你的歡快，但不必更詛咒，更歡快，使文字溢過你的情緒。（與其在文字符號上加工，母寧培養情緒本質。）</p>
<p>自然，誇張的苦衷也有。允其是現在，一個文藝工作者，爲要完成神聖的任務，激起仇恨的心情，鼓勵光明的追逐，因此會過分顧慮到效果。不僅寫下自己感受的情緒，更寫下感受以上的情緒。於是問題發生了。自已不會感受的傳給人家，文字過分的渲染，與虛構的氛圍，是否能喬裝實感的情緒？這問題我可以乾脆的回答：不能！託爾斯泰在藝術論裏面告訴過我們：「藝術是人類的活動，其中所包括的是一個人用了某種外的記號，將他體騐過的種種感情，意識地傳給別人，而且別人被這些感情所動，也來體騐他們。」理由很顯明，要感染別人，先要自己有相當的情緒，正如你有貨品然後纔能販賣給人家。超過感受以上的，這是文字，不是眞實的情緒。你自己還不曾感動，人家如何能感動。</p>
<p>眞正動人的作品，是决定於作者的感情的。作者環境切身的體騐，歡快或悲哀，流淚或含笑，豐富的情緒構成濃厚的氛圍，即使寫成文字，但這還不是文字，這是眞實的感情。沒有一點誇張的感情，這感情纔能打動那心弦的鍵子。</p>
<p>尼采說：「最高尙的美，是非突然襲來的，不作强烈的麻醉的刺激。」所謂麻醉的刺激」便是一種强迫的感染，而不是作者潛移默化的能力。只有生活經騐少和粗心浮氣的人纔缺少感情。也只有這種人專冰店　倚重文字作浮淺，呌囂，不切實際的咆哮與呻吟，咆哮與呻吟原都不免，但那種有意誇張的「文字的吶喊」，我却是反對的。</p>
<p>誇張的原因，常是加厚情緒的氛圍，然而這氛圍幷不是眞正的情緒，牠是一堆方字的組合。聰明的辦法還是先鍛鍊你自己的情緒，使感情奔放，意識正確，生活經騐豐富，到後你情緒自然會有紀律。你不必誇張，寫下你所感受的，冷靜，老實，已經足够。不必强迫，人家自然會感受。也毋須「突襲」，而結果却如磁石的吸引。這吶喊是情緒的」而非「文字的」。</p>
<p>文章中充滿濃厚愛憎的氣氛，我不反對。但這種氣氛須先被作者體騐過。假使不曾，那麼還須先鍛鍊你自己的感情。否則你心雖可原，而事殊無益。</p>

<p>—壯丁生活的片段</p>
<p>抽過籤，大家就陸續退出廣塲。四週是安閒的，肅靜的，像停止了呼吸；太陽爬上天頂一絲風也不動，祇有偶爾幾陣蟬聲，拖着深長的調子，橫寧傳過來，劃閒了深沉的寂寞</p>
<p>重陰下，圍坐着八百個中籤的壯丁，靜靜地等待入營時問的到來。</p>
<p>「還祇有十二點一刻？時光可多麽作弄人呀？」一個人揚起手錶這樣說。他不耐煩地站起身，望望天空，又望望遼遠的山谷。</p>
<p>「我恨不得立刻飛上前綫，飛到山外，痛快地砍一陣！從鮮血的急流中，發洩我心胸的積恨；然後，掮着光耀的戰利品，　慢慢地走回來。」</p>
<p>「急什麼？時間已不遠了！總有實現的一天。」</p>
<p>「是啊，土地上所有的污點，總有洗刷乾凈的一天！」</p>
<p>「你是藝術家，我相信，你將來運用藝術的手法，必定高於我們的硬砍……」</p>
<p>還有幾個人又站了起來，昂然走了幾步，揑緊着拳頭。</p>
<p>望望手錶，入營祗差半小時了。</p>
<p>小路上，遠遠地浮動着人影，三三兩兩，連續地由山脚邊走過來。</p>
<p>他們是些老頭子，老婆婆，年輕的婦人，還有小孩子。可多末熱鬧，一陣陣歡笑聲跟着飛揚過來。他們是中籤壯丁的家屬，特地趕來送別的。幾個壯丁奔上前去，握着手高興地說：「我中籖了，下半天二點鐘入營。」</p>
<p>他們便互相擁合着聚成一大堆：狂笑着，呌噪着，高談着，歡呼着……</p>
<p>一個龍鍾的老先生，掀一掀銀絲似的長鬚對着一個笑着說：「孩子：你中了籤，眞是幸運，得到了報國的機會，我也替你高興！盼望你努力前進。」</p>
<p>一位美麗的少婦，站在她丈夫身旁，低聲細語：「先有國，而後才有家。你去罷，不必留戀！等到勝利之日，我在凱旋之門下歡迎你，唱支你愛聽的歌。」</p>
<p>「萬一我受了傷，我就希望做你看護下的傷兵。」那位壯丁也向妻這樣打趣。</p>
<p>又有一個小孩子，揮起手，伸長　子：「爸爸：你別忘記帶匹矮馬回來。」</p>
<p>噠噠底噠……遠遠的司令台的號音忽然滑上長空；噪雜的廣塲上，頓時又靜了下來。口哨緊張地響着，一陣又一陣，壯丁們就很迅速地集中在一起，一刹那就排列成爲一條長蛇。</p>
<p>敎練官跑來，開始檢閱，接着是訓話，他說：「你們現在要開始工作了。希望千你門努力負責，用智和力去尋求收穫！你們的成就，不但是你們本身的功績，並且，也是地方上的極大的榮光。所以，在臨別的今天起，我天天希望…。」</p>
<p>繼若，就是×長來檢閱：溶成一條鐵流在展開着。</p>
<p>當繞過了塲子一週時，開動的號音又劃破長空，營附吹起口哨，在隊旁整步，向着指定駐紥的破廟行進。</p>
<h3 id="c121">高僧 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— 冰夫</p>
<p>在一所破落的古廟裏，住着一位高僧：他似乎爲着沉重的木魚撞擊聲而甜蜜地生活着，靜穆閑雅，無淚無笑地踱着人生的大道：萬事如過眼烟雲，一切都不能攪擾他的方寸！</p>
<p>誰理解他？誰羨慕他？然而他無待於人家的理解，更不要人家羨慕。光陰飛過去，樹木增加着年輸，高價平添了白髮！</p>
<p>白髮是他的功行的籌碼，從木魚的每一撞擊聲中逐漸滋長着。他的企圖，無非在生命的活的一端斜着傾注到寂滅的另一端，中間不致被突然的割裂，却流泉似地緩緩的穿越了嶙峋的山石使合流於四無涯岸的大海，在過程中他不希望成爲飛躍萬丈的瀑布，也不希望成爲奔騰澎湃的激湍。這樣，他會不着痕跡地由生而至死。死了便是他的歸宿！</p>
<p>我理解他，我也羨慕他，但我更希望他能理解我，像我——以及恒河沙數像我樣的世界上的人，是不會被他功行勸化的！這並不是說我「無緣」，「綠」本可以隨着主觀而被吾定的。其顯著的差異點是我們好生而惡死！而且卽或我們在樂於「引刀成一快」的時候，至少的條件是「不負少年頭」！</p>
<p>從他迄未曾嘮叨而惹厭地强人皈依一點立論，他顯然不是企圖十方佈施的庸俗緇流，但，你如果一檢騐他所累積的功行，則自始至終都表明他是絕端的利己主義者，因之其與庸俗緇流相差的距離，也不過一黍之隔！所以他祇能獨善自己，却不能普度衆生。這不是他不能發「大宏願」，祇是心餘力絀，怕多麻煩而已！</p>
<p>我理解他，他是些微痛苦都不能忍受的懦夫！我也羨慕他，他能巧妙地引木魚爲知己！</p>

<p>— 高爾基著　狄周譯</p>
<p>她的四圍喧鬧着一班醉鬼。——而且一切，從鴇母，姊妹們到天花板的裂縫，她都是熟悉不過的。</p>
<p>她以粗濁的聲音說話，只有當客人們捻弄她的時候，她才發出强健的農夫一樣高聲大笑；笑得全身震勁。在姊妹們中，算最蠢笨，最健康的她倒不是比她們更幸福些，因爲她比起她們來，她是更類似一隻母獸啊！</p>
<p>不消說，在瓦西卡比什麽地方都管束得更緊的這一家裏，姑娘們對他的恐怖和憎惡是愈積愈深了。她們吃醉酒時，便隱不住這種感情大聲地對嫖客們數說瓦西卡，可是因爲嫖客們總不曾在瓦西卡面前保護她們，所以這種訴苦一點效果也沒有。又當她們激奪得歇斯特里的呼號起來的時候，給瓦西卡聽見了——他那火一般的臉孔便在客廳門口出現，以冷然的硬生生的聲昔說：</p>
<p>『您別胡縐！……』</p>
<p>『劊子手！充軍的！』女的呌了，『你幹麽要把我打成廢人呢？看，老爺，那傢伙拿鞭子把我打得這麽厲害，……』呌着的妓女便要撕開自己的衣服來給別人看。</p>
<p>這時候瓦西卡走過去，抓住她的手，用不變調子的聲音說話——這是特別可怕的——但是他饒了她。</p>
<p>『別吵！……你可不肯安靜點嗎？嘩啦嘩啦的鬧些什麼呀？——你醉了……將來看！』</p>
<p>平常大槪就這麽算了，只有很少的幾次，瓦西卡把女的帶出客廳裏。不管妓女中有許多是他的意中人，她們誰也博得過他一句溫存話。他只不過把她當女人來受用，愛那個就選上那個　，他便對她這樣說：</p>
<p>「今晚到你房裏過夜，……』於是他走進那女的房子去幽會一下，對那女的不說一句話，幹完就走。</p>
<p>『呀，是惡魔呀！』關於他姑娘們總這麽傳說着。</p>
<p>他住居的那窑子裏的姑娘，差不多全都挨决接觸過，阿玖斯尼亞也不能免：實際上在和她發生關係時，每决總非常殘酷的蹂躪她。</p>
<p>强健，懶惰的她，非常貪睡。不管客廳裏鬧得怎樣兇，她常常當衆睡去。一坐到哪個角落上，她就一會兒便停了丟弄媚眼，兩眼突然粘在什麼對象上面，靜靜放下眼皮閉上眼睛了。而大粒的白牙露在外面，下唇掛下無憂無慮的打鼾引得客人和姊妹們都閧笑起來。但是笑聲還是喚不醒阿玖斯尼亞。</p>
<p>在她是常有那樣的事。鴇母嚴厲的駡她，批她的頰，可是總趕不掉她身上的陲魔。她稍爲哭泣一會，便又睡着了。</p>
<p>於是瓦西卡有戲唱了。</p>
<p>有一次，她和一個沉醉的客人同靠在椅子上睡着了，瓦西卡走近去，偷偷的抓住她的手，拖着她出來。（五）</p>
<h3 id="c125">（二）論做事的方法（續昨） <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— 謝</p>
<p>（五）往往有一般人，起初立意很好，把榮耀歸於上帝，可是後來因爲要滿足一已的私欲，改變了最初的的宗旨，以致前功盡棄，非常可惜。我們要抱定宗旨，始終把榮耀歸於上帝，而不可歸之於自己。（六）別人的惡事，我們不可加以宣揚。以下是立意純正的證據（一）一個立意純正的人，常常把宗敎的事務放在俗務之前。重視養心修道，而輕視養身求名。寗願犧牲，而不願獲利。（二）一個人在家中，敬重上帝，好像在大衆之前一般，就可知他的立意純正。（三）一個人自己常常努力爲善，而對於別人的善行也極力的稱讚，這是立意純正的憑證。古聖摩西希望人人都做先知，是見他的大公無私的精神。（四）輕視世間富貴榮華而自私的人。（五）在貧窮時有舊一樣的敬重上帝。總之，同是宗敎事情，有的做得有意義，有的做得無意義，其分別全在於立意純正與否。譬如施捨本爲調濟貧苦，齋戒本爲節慾養心，禱吿本爲求道，恭敬本爲謙虛，克已本爲忍耐，可是，如果不是出於眞意的。那末，施捨就像法利賽人，等於虛擲，齋戒就像耶洗別，你徒受勞苦，禱吿就像猶大，口是心非恭敬就像亞哈，一味虛僞，克己就像邪敎徒的殉敎，白白受罪。希圖外表的美名，而無內心的眞意，百體雖全，靈魂已去，簡直是行尸走肉，有何足貴？上海基督敎文字佈道會，郵箱一二二七號</p>

<p>— 圓</p>
<p>兩個高級學生一學期費用共一百五十元　各項費用可省則省使學生多得求學機會</p>
<p>整個的家鄕都在砲火下犧牲了！上無片瓦遮身，下無粒米果腹，不得已只好逃到這暫時的避難所來。</p>
<p>預定所有小小的儲蓄，除了一間小亭子間的房租外，其他省吃儉用，的略還可敷衍九十個月，略放下一條心。</p>
<p>大問題來了，孩子們的前途是不能躭擱的，無論如何，總要送他們上學。</p>
<p>拿了附近幾個小學的章程來看，高級小學的學費是二十元至三十元，還有雜費書籍費。甲校較近，學費二十五元，雜費三元，圖書費一元，體育費一元，共要三十元，書籍費在外。好在路近可省車錢，硬了頭皮，且去試一試看。</p>
<p>帶了兩個孩子去報名，付了報名費四元，考費二元，收條上聲明，這費是不在學費內扣除的。</p>
<p>考取了，須先去註册留額，新生須繳入學金五元，學校基金五元，這也是不在學費內扣除的。怎樣辦呢？要讀書就要錢，當然不付是不行的啊！</p>
<p>開學了，除付去學雜圖書體育等費之外，書籍簿子文具由校代辦，預付五元，多還少補。當然要「照章繳淸各費始得上課」的。</p>
<p>送他們去上課了，才鬆了一口氣，統計前後共付去九十六元。這是兩個學生讀高級小學一學期的代價！</p>
<p>靑天一霹靂！第二天學生回來報告老師說的，每人要補繳制服費三元，徽章費五角，校刊費三角，級會費兩角，兩人叉是八元。沒奈何，只得繳！繳！</p>
<p>好容易平安過了一個月。</p>
<p>第二月的第一天，孩子們帶回了一張通告：略謂本校係借他校上課，多所不便，現已覓定新址，於××路即日起遷該處上課云云。好！又加上一筆車費飯費！</p>
<p>學期結束了，叉要付留額費五元，統計兩個高小學生一學期，共用去一百五十元。</p>
<p>經濟破產的我，又沒有收人，那能負担這樣大的敎育費，沒奈何，只好讓他們暫時輟學。</p>
<p>想起來，總有不少人和我同病相憐的，所以我懇切的希望各學校當局儘量節省閒支，减低收費，以减輕家長負担，多送子弟上舉，而達到國家救育的本旨。譬如簿籍雖然由學校定製的整齊美觀，然這樣一來不免成本加重，一本卅二員的簿子，校外不過五六分，校內要一爲，就相差多了，又如校刋，雖然有許多好處，然而沒有也不見得有損書，在這百物昂貴的時候，是不甚適宜的。其他如體育制服手工等費，也應可省則省。叉如重重疊疊的入學金基本金等費，倒好似苛捐雜稅，這一點，希望敎育當局加以切念的考慮而加以改進的。更希望不要以少數獎勵優良學子的免費額來招徠學生，而能切實的减低全體學生的費用。須知優良學生固應加以獎勵，而佔國民中更多數平凡的學生，更需要敎育。</p>
<p>假使每個學校都能顧到社會的各方面而斟酌所收的費用，所敎的課程，那麼我相信敎育是一定能够普及的，國家的前送是一定有希望的。</p>

<p>— 沈宥</p>
<p>馬如飛與女彈詞（本節應補排在三）（日本文第一段後）</p>
<p>是可見一直到嘉慶末年，女彈詞還是個人獨立，隨地彈唱，沒有固定處所。道光以後，纔漸被重視，而有彈唱的塲子。不過在初期，彈唱的還不是所謂「書寓」，依舊是一班「盲女」。馬如飛未刋的開篇「世間何事」，彈唱的就是對她們生活的諷刺：</p>
<p>世間何事最傷心　美女可憐瞎眼睛描龍繡鳳難串綫　燒茶煮飯欠分明　遊山玩景全無分　演戲單聽的鑼鼓聲　光天化日如陰雨　不分晝夜亂昏昏　任憑貌比西施美　那怕男子貪歡亦不同情　長成少幼成婚配　只好南詞學唱做女先生　登塲小曲油腔調　弦子琵琶就把雙擋餅　面上搽粉鑽花朶　身上的衣衫盡綢綾　當面看來眞可怕　然而風流只看得背後行　路逢知己將他呌但聽聲音不見人與他陽臺不認識襄王面　必故幾度巫山迷雨雲　只呌無鬚就是佾郞君</p>
<p>這里所說的「女先生」，實際上就是初期的「書寓」，其與後來「書寓」不同的，祇是「瞎眼」與「不瞎眼」而已。馬如飛那時在蘇州，他對漸漸興起的「女彈詞」，特殊是女彈詞的生活，表示非常不滿意。爲着說書事業的尊嚴，他曾不惜加以强力的抨擊。「世間何事」即其一例。不過他的反對，實質上是不止於此，可以再看他朱刊的另一開篇陰盛陽衰」：</p>
<p>陰盛陽衰自古云　衙門坍場廟廊新蘇州花樣年年換　書塲都用女先生　嚴織雲三字無人問　老娘娘年邁不時新　可惜出粗出現忒離經　姚家姐妹姑和嫂　以姚爲姓以蘭名　周袁變擋小聲名　李翠雲景翠雲　還有姑蘇居翠雲　三朶翠雲一氣升　艷容宮粉三分厚　面上麻潭要嵌平踏遍容顏徐淑貞　九寸頭大脚眞難看　走路依稀木屐聲　有才有貌兼有技　到處皆知陸綉卿　紳衿富戶常來往　出入常州吳縣兩衙門　鬼話運篇未必眞　方秋蟾會打徽州白　還帶三分常熟音　親家翁與親家母　兒女親關兒女情　王瑞雲　馬秀英無才無貌逐出門　我門幸賴衣冠客　苦這苦瞎彈瞎唱瞎先生　無處伸寃閉眼睛</p>
<p>在「世間何事」里，祇表白了馬如飛對女彈詞的增惡，是並沒有多少價值的。這「陰盛陽衰」偏却不同，不僅指出了女彈詞在蘇州開始繁榮的情况，也使我們得知初期蘇州女彈詞人物。這些人物，如果沒有如飛這一開篇，我們是許將永久無法得知。與「陰盛陽衰」可作參證的，還有如飛未刋的嵌名開篇「方秋蟾魄」：</p>
<p>方秋螠魄照愁人　雙淚紛紛落纑衾牙床舖疊張玉鳳　閑弄瑤琴欄外聽　兩鴻徐月娥眉瑣　僵瘦芳容病未輕　和衣橫睡雲盡亂　舉止風情雨意生　想天生拈織雲中景　不見牛郞乘綵雲　料理彩雲烏省事乞巧相傳訂月鐵　望天河張宿奎星現玉凈香烟一縷生　瑤心蘭質愁成病　何鎖蛾眉何捧心　別郞周數眞長久　害得我减精神　龍馬瘦婷婷　易散歡塲竟彩雲（本篇未完）（六）</p>
<h3 id="c128">自新運動 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— 張鎮山</p>
<p>關於儉約能做到十四條規定嗎　摒絕嗜好能做到以下的五條嗎</p>
<p>在全國各省市，甚至窮鄉僻壤都在度着簡單的戰時生活，以節省物力，俾作正用的時期，獨有上海一隅好像是例外的，到處充滿了極蓬勃的歌舞昇平的氣象，一般人沉湎於奢侈，頹廢，懶惰的享樂生活，迄至今日，尙不稍衰。這些有用的人力物力浪費在那漩渦裹，是多麽可惜？過去的，有：「節的運動」「十不運動」等，都收得了相當的成效，現在基督敎學生團體聯合會又發起一個「自新運動」。</p>
<p>按眞正的基督敎徒，對於敎規及其他規的，本來是具有絕對信仰，服從的堅决精神。例如：不吸烟，不飲酒之類的小寥，他們也始終奉行不懈，所以宗敎團體個別發起的運動，較之一般對象太廣泛，太普遍，社會性的糾正不良生活的組織或宣傳，收效必多。</p>
<p>現在這個「自新運動」，雖以學生爲對象，但其所訂立的「更生公的」，較以前各項運動的規的更爲積極，充實。關於儉的方面，有十四條：（一）我建立並嚴格執行個人預算制，養成逐日記賬的習慣；（二）我不做新衣，有做的必耍時，不做高貴奢侈的；（三）對於日常用品，不存厭舊喜新的思想；（四）少用化妝品，不穿絲襪，不燙髮；（五）寫信不用華貴信封信紙；（六）减少吃零食；（七）不乘頭等車；（八）遊公園少拍照；（九）不經常舉行聚餐會……（十）過時過節减少開支；（十一）我在生活裏實行節的，將每月所節省的金錢捐給國家及受難者；（十二）盡力服務學生團體或社會慈善及敎育工作；（十三）自己的事不必勞役別人；（十四）注意大衆生活，多我機會接近他們，瞭解他們，和帮助他們。</p>
<p>關於摒絕嗜好方面，也有五條：（一）正當娛樂是生活的維他命，我用運動，音樂，奕棋，書畫，寫作，等嗜好，以及團體生活來代替不正當的娛樂；（二）减少看電影决數……（三）不上無意識或低級趣味的娛樂塲；（四）小賭博，不义麻將；（五）不吸烟，不飮酒。</p>
<p>上述這些規條，雖不能說是盡善盡美，但其所能產生的效果，可以說：使得每一個錢不會用到無益的地方去；每一個人不會做國家社會的　蟲。把人力和物力集中到國家社會福利上面去運用，一方面固然於國家社會有益，另一方面也是間接迭福於己。更明白點說：把不良的習慣糾正過來，養成吃苦耐勞的精神，可以應付更艱困的生活環境；把一切奢侈，虛耗的金錢節省下來，可以移作救濟難胞或備將來自己支持生活之用。目前沉迷於不正當的享樂，雖不能肯定即會墮落，但至少總阻滯了一個人前進的思想和動向。因此，勵行節的的確是必要的。「更生公的」發起的團體，希望各省市學界響應履行，然而，非學界也不妨自動的履行，更進而謀可能的擴充範圍。</p>

<p>— 潤滋</p>
<p>凡是一種物件，能具兩種功用，當然是最受人歡迎的。譬如六七年前，盛行過一種防雨布，據說將普通本廠錢呢，在某種化學原汁　浸漬一番，取出便有抵抗潮濕雨淋的功效：而布的本質上，仍不着一些痕跡。所以晴天穿了，便是件長衫：遇到下雨天氣，便可當牠雨衣了。最近市面上，忽然盛行一種防雨草帽，又像幾年前的防雨布一般的熱鬧起來，老板們似乎知道顧客們有些疑心，爲證明他們誠信不欺起見，便在橱窗裏把防雨草帽浸在水缸裏，給人看，表示牠確有經水不變的防雨功效。於是一般戴過巴拿馬，小呂宋，草帽因遇雨而走樣的朋友，經不起這「防雨」二字烟幕宣傳，來改用這來歷不明的防雨草帽了。</p>
<p>不知防雨草帽原料是什麼製成的朋友，或者會因防雨二字的宣傳，疑心到這防雨草帽，是橡皮製成的；或者是某種化學原質製造的。其實拆穿西洋鏡，防雨草帽的原料，是紙頭的，不過牠運到我國來的是毛坯，只要加上一層薄薄的噴漆，所謂防雨草帽，便告成功了。因此，甲商出售的，便冠上甲商的牌子；乙商出售的，便冠上乙商的字號。不知底細的人，總當牠是完全國貨，又誰知牠的來歷是那樣的糢糊呢！我們卽退一步言，抛開情感不說，卽以經濟條件言：旣是以紙質造成的東西，無論牠外表怎樣華美，其不能經久耐用，自可斷言。至於說到防雨問題，僅靠一層薄薄的噴漆，究竟能够維持多少時日？自然又成疑問。何况噴漆日子稍久，卽會脫落，到那時侯，斑斑點點，恐怕非但不能防雨，便是用作遮蔽太陽也有些不好意思。</p>

<h3 id="c131">侯玉蘭之總檢討（上） <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>給論是「必紅無疑」</p>
<p>侯玉蘭，年十九，北平人，生小即愛好戲劇，十五歲考入中國高級戲曲職業學校。時該校學生習靑衣最紅者爲趙金蓉，聲馳南北。玉蘭家貧，其母聞氏，以女紅自給，玉蘭冀得一藝以養母，於是敦品勵學，以求進益。</p>
<p>吾友金仲蓀先生（兆掞號悔廬）接辦戲校後，每遇名角演劇，即派學生前往觀摹。侯玉蘭宗程，（硯秋）王金璐宗楊，（小樓）王和霖宗馬，（運良）李玉茹宗荀，（慧生）……皆由於此。（戲校注重團體演習，而不標榜個人，故傑才甚多，而滬上知者尙少，惟宋德珠經半月戲劇之介紹，已爲滬人士所深知。）玉蘭崇拜玉霜，每演必覜，對於程之唱做念打，手眼身法步，無不處處留神，課畢即口誦心維，揣摩練習，玉霜亦常加指導，故能成功一個程派傑才。</p>
<p>玉蘭唱工宗程，得其三昧，某唱片公司慕其才，嘗以重金請其灌「孔雀東南飛」一片，行世雖暫，而銷數甚暢。玉霜得意之作，玉蘭均擅勝塲。孔雀東南飛一劇，原爲玉霜擬排四大新戲之一齣，而贈與戲校公演者。當此劇初决公演時，先由趙金蓉任主角，由王瑤卿導演，嗣改派玉蘭主演，玉霜又親加指導，數决登塲，俱留盛譽。故此劇不特爲玉蘭之代表作，抑亦爲戲校代表作之一。自是以後，舊都坤角，皆羣起摩仿，有改名「仲卿與蘭芝」者，有改名「焦仲卿」者，亦有改名爲「生死淚」者，因此劇中國戲曲學校有專演權，故仿演者不得不另改劇名，然其魔力之大，亦可窺見其一斑矣。</p>
<p>玉蘭做工亦宗玉霜，玉霜水袖工夫，陳墨香稱其空前。玉蘭水袖工夫，玉謝誇其妙造自然，玉蘭跑園塲，進窰門等工夫，均與玉霜近似，武家坡劇中，可以概見。玉蘭藝宗玉霜，而又教品勵學，與玉霜之「藝進乎道」相若，故羣以「女硯秋」稱之。</p>
<p>玉蘭拿手好戲，在舊劇方面，爲玉堂春，王寳釧，探母回令，實蓮燈，金鎖記，硃痕記，駡殿，敎子，梅玉配，雁門關等。在未畢業時，即有大家氣象。新劇方面，因配角問題，此决未必上演。玉蘭扮像似畹華，凌霄漢閣呼爲「賽蘭芳」，叉呼爲「女侯爺」，有文爲證：</p>
<p>『我呼侯玉蘭爲「賽蘭芳」，朋輩羣稱「女硯秋」，亦未爲不可，微號無非煊染，成功還在自身。</p>
<p>提起這位「女侯爺」從三四年前就可一望而知爲「了不得的人材」，共容端重而又流麗，此可以足「看」者也；其歌宏亮而峭利，此可以飽「聽」者也。謂之兼梅程之長，未免太誇；謂之限於一宗一派，亦覺抱屈，她似乎時時刻刻在留心諸前輩之長而利用之，此梅程成功之一素因」也。如此方是了不得，眞眞了不得！」</p>

<p>編者介紹：周璇，現爲國華公司唯一女台柱。早歲從事歌舞生涯，即嶄露頸角；四年前開始躍上銀幕，演片甚多，其成名作爲袁收之導演之「馬路天使」，近作如「孟姜女」「李三娘」諸片，亦多別具風格，能予一般觀衆較多的好感。</p>
<p>向來不大出遠門，在戰事發生以後，忽然萬里迢迢的，到菲列濱去跑了一趟。</p>
<p>是前年冬天，淞滬抗戰陣綫西移未久；菲列濱有人來洽，邀我去參加表演；並說是爲救難籌款的。我想：在上海太悶了，正好假此換換空氣，同時，站在戲劇崗位上做　一點應做的工作，這亦是一個適當機會。所以，當下便和嚴華先生跟他們一起南行了。</p>
<p>這劇團名叫「中國萬花團」，是臨時組織成功的；除了由我充當主角的話劇組外，並有平劇，歌舞等幾種游藝包括在內。全體團員共三十餘人，先到香港集合了，在那裹製備服裝，加勁排練，住了近兩個月，才出發前去。</p>
<p>從香港到菲列濱，只經三天行程。這地方已是熱帶區域；大郵船當在海洋中逐决推進，便覺一天熱似一天，因爲海風很大，倒還不覺得怎樣；等到抵埠上陸之後，却就熱得更比大伏天還厲害，差不多竟要「熱昏」了。眞的，香港到這裏，就像從冷氣電影院跑出門外到烈日之下的情形是全沒兩樣</p>

<p>徐碧雲是名小生徐貴芳的第四子，他同徐蘭園，徐斌壽都是昆仲行，初時曾在俞振庭主持的斌慶社學習武旦，武工極爲嫻熟，所以他於享名後常時反申「八大鎚」的陸文龍，不但功架，槍花，胥有足觀，而且也很有武小生的姿態，絕無他人偶兩反串時生疏之弊。一則因爲家學溯源，二來因他的根基打得好，故而演出戲來才能得到觀衆的稱許。還有一層。他的「綠珠墮樓」那種跳蹤的硬工和「霸王別姬」的舞劍，也是時下一般名旦所難及的。出科後他因同蘭芳締姻，鑑於梅氏到處受人歡迎的盛况，遂即棄了他的木行，（武旦）時向梅氏請益而改習梅派花衫了。同時他舅父吳彩霞又是有名的正工靑衣，對他愛護有加，不時敎授他些好腔，所以他初成名時的嗓背，唱　，都是很規矩，很大方的。十餘年前高亭公司曾灌過他的「寳蓮燈」「女起解」，那種純出於自然的歌喉，的確是很稀有的。北平瑞蚨祥的經理孟四爺（外號孟四憂子）非常賞識他的藝術，曾收他爲義子，該號爲故都最大之綢緞皮貨莊，提起祥字號的孟老闆，是婦孺皆知的。碧雲自從拜了這位義父之後，不但是捧塲有人，每演必賣滿堂，而且他所有新製的行頭，全是向瑞蚨祥揀選頂好的料子作的。唱花衫第一要講究行頭漂亮，蘭芳行頭之多而且新，那是誰也比不了的。可是碧雲就極力要和他比併，拚命的添製新衣，好在全是不花錢得來的，自然樂得出出風頭了。（五六）</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The situation in Beihai is tense again, with an increase in Japanese warships nearby and Japanese soldiers attempting to land. The Japanese troops surrounding Weizhou Island are also increasing their defenses, preparing to invade. The Chinese side claims that the increased defenses on Weizhou Island pose a great threat to Vietnam but have little relation to an attack on Beihai. The inland areas of Hainan Island have been subjected to indiscriminate bombing by Japanese planes in recent days, resulting in many casualties among Chinese civilians. (Special dispatch, 10th afternoon)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: At 8 a.m. on the 9th, Japanese troops launched a fierce attack on Zhongshan, forcibly landing at Gushi, attempting to seize Shiqi. More than thirty Chinese garrison units, along with local militias, repelled and ambushed them. Fierce fighting continued until late at night. (Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: On the morning of the 9th, the Japanese troops attacking Zhongshan, numbering four to five hundred, set off from Jimen North Street at dawn, aboard two shallow-water warships, three electric boats, and forty motorboats, heading for Kushi via Gu Zhen Ai, constantly shelling the coast. Three Japanese planes simultaneously flew in, conducting frenzied bombing. Under the cover of intense firepower from the sea and air, the Japanese soldiers suddenly launched a forced landing in the Kushi area. Chinese garrison troops defended the river steadfastly, calmly engaging the enemy, repeatedly inflicting heavy losses on the landing Japanese troops. (Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Japanese troops in Chao'an have increased by nearly a thousand, while there are more than two thousand Japanese troops in Jiangmen and Xinhui, and more than three hundred Japanese troops in North Street. Yesterday and today, they have been under fierce siege by Chinese troops, suffering many casualties. The Japanese army appears to be preparing to withdraw. The Japanese troops in Hebei, Guangzhou, have mostly retreated to Henan, with many wounded and sick. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) According to reports from Chinese people, fierce fighting broke out last night in the waterways leading to Shiqi. Chinese troops opened fire with machine guns on advancing Japanese ships. At dawn, the Japanese ships retreated. It is reported that Japanese planes were very active yesterday, flying to the scene of last night's battle. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) It is rumored that Japanese aircraft pilots in Guangzhou are plotting to rebel. The incident was exposed, and more than sixty people were arrested and sent to Japan. (Special dispatch, 10th) The Chinese counter-attacking forces are still making progress. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Liuhuang: On the 6th, Japanese troops used more than twenty rubber boats to attack Chenghai. A Chinese unit rushed to reinforce upon hearing the news, sinking two Japanese boats. The Japanese troops fled back to Shantou in a panic. (Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Jinhua: On the morning of the 9th, more than two hundred Japanese soldiers, under the cover of Japanese warships, forcibly landed at Meiliping, southwest of Kanmen in Yuhuan. They were met with a head-on attack by Chinese defense forces. By the morning of the 10th, the Japanese troops had completely retreated to their ships. On Jiguan Mountain Island, due east of Kanmen, more than a hundred Japanese soldiers entrenched themselves on the afternoon of the 9th, engaging in looting. They had not left by noon on the 10th. (Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, reports from Hainan Island indicate that the indigenous Li people of Hainan Island ambushed a Japanese naval landing force on June 25, killing more than two hundred Japanese soldiers. The next day, forty Japanese planes retaliated against the Li people in the Wuzhi Mountains, bombing them all day and killing more than two thousand Li people. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Xingji: Most of the fighting in Shanxi Province has been quiet. More than five thousand Japanese troops recently moved from northern Shanxi through Zihongkou towards Qin County. Judging from the movements of the Japanese army, they seem to be attempting to control southeastern Shanxi, so as to join forces with the Japanese troops in southern Hebei to attack the Taihang Mountains and break through the base areas of the Chinese guerrillas, thus ensuring the safety of the Pinghan Railway. (Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Xingji: Various routes in eastern Shanxi have seen frequent engagements. The Japanese troops invading south along the Baijin Highway are currently in a standoff in the Ping Temple area north of Qin County. More than a thousand Japanese troops invading eastward from Linfen and occupying Guweizhen (southeast of Anze) are engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese troops east of Fucheng. More than a thousand Japanese troops from Heshun are advancing southeastward and have occupied Shicun, with the momentum to continue invading south. Four thousand Japanese troops have been added to Wanghezhen and will join forces with the various Japanese routes to invade. The Chinese armies are resisting step by step. (Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Side Announces: War Situation on the Outer Mongolian Border; Japanese Troops Encounter Difficulties in the Delta; Heavy Artillery Battles on Both Banks of the Halha River <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, this station received a Japanese military dispatch stating: "The 'Manchukuo'-Japanese allied forces are currently 'clearing out' the remnants of Soviet-Mongolian troops south of the Hölsten River and on the Balshagah Heights north of the river. The delta between the Hölsten and Halha Rivers is scattered with swamps and sand dunes, making it difficult for the Japanese army to advance. Yesterday, both sides exchanged artillery fire throughout the day. The Soviet-Mongolian artillery on the west bank of the Halha River opened fire at 8 a.m., and the Japanese artillery immediately returned fire. Air battles and tank battles also ensued. Both the Japanese and Soviet artillery demonstrated their power. Some Soviet shells landed behind Japanese positions, as far as the vicinity of the Japanese field hospital. At 1 p.m., a Japanese bomber squadron, assisted by a fighter squadron, appeared in the skies over the battlefield, bombing the Soviet-Mongolian positions on the west bank of the Halha River. At 7 p.m., after the Japanese fighter planes left the battle zone, twelve Soviet bombers flew to the area between the Japanese field hospital and the first line of battle and dropped bombs. The Japanese side immediately opened fire with anti-aircraft guns and dispatched fighter planes to intercept them. It is reported that the Soviet planes hurriedly dropped their bombs and fled back to the Mongolian border. At around 9 p.m., the Soviet artillery positions on the west bank of the Halha River reopened fire, but without any clear targets. It is reported that the Japanese army captured more than fifty tanks and armored vehicles, as well as a large number of guns, including three 15cm shrapnel howitzers and two field guns. The captured shrapnel howitzers were all in good condition. The Japanese army used them to bombard the Soviet-Mongolian troops who were fleeing across the Halha River, inflicting heavy losses on them. A thousand Soviet soldiers, carrying forty tanks and more than a hundred armored vehicles, retreated to the west bank of the river under heavy Japanese artillery fire, abandoning more than six hundred corpses. At the same time, more than a hundred damaged Soviet tanks and armored vehicles were also abandoned in the delta region between the Halha and Hölsten Rivers. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tokyo Japanese dispatch: At 1 p.m. today, Japanese planes engaged in another air battle with Soviet planes over the Halha River on the "Manchukuo"-Soviet border. One Japanese plane has not yet returned to its base. (Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Third Countries Need Not Mediate Between China and Japan - Wang Chonghui's Opinion - China's Open Door Policy Remains Unchanged - Japan's Interests Often Conflict with Those of Third Countries <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Chinese Foreign Minister Dr. Wang Chonghui told an Associated Press reporter today that it is not necessary for third countries to mediate between China and Japan at this time. If China were to conclude a peace agreement with Japan based on Japanese conditions, conflicts between Japan and the interests of third countries would still occur from time to time, and there would be no peace. As for China's position, it is very clear. China's policy is the Open Door, and its future policy will remain the Open Door. As for the current issue, it is not only a matter of China's independence and freedom but also a matter of the rights and interests of third countries. The most fundamental aspect of this is the issue of the Nine-Power Treaty's guarantee of China's territorial integrity, the Open Door, and equal trade for all countries. Therefore, countries with interests here are also involved. The interests of third countries cannot be interfered with. Therefore, the issue of the rights and interests of Japan and third countries is not something that China can or should intervene in. In the future, Japan need not respect the rights and interests of third countries. If third countries can adopt a united policy to exert pressure on Japan, it can not only protect the rights and interests of other countries. Regarding the current Anglo-Japanese negotiations, Wang stated that these negotiations are likely to fail. On the one hand, the views of the two sides are too far apart. At the same time, the UK wishes to treat the matter as a local incident, but Japan hopes to gain far greater issues through this negotiation. Wang also said that the reason why the Anglo-Japanese talks are so difficult is because the Japanese views are entirely controlled by Japanese military cliques. Regarding the situation after the breakdown of the Anglo-Japanese conference, Wang believes that Japan is likely to threaten to occupy the concessions by force. However, Wang does not believe that Japan can truly do so, as such action would be too reckless. Wang firmly believes that the UK will refuse to discuss the various issues that Japan hopes for, as the UK has no right to discuss issues related to other countries. Therefore, these Anglo-Japanese negotiations are bound to fail. However, if the UK yields to Japan, Japan will shift its demands to other areas. Speaking of the US neutrality issue, Wang believes that this case will be debated at length in the Senate. The current neutrality law clearly hinders the US government's responsibility for world affairs. Credit loans, with a term of only three months, are greatly unfavorable to China. As for the provisions on banning the export of arms, they will harm Britain and France if a European war breaks out. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e4">Observing the Tokyo Negotiations <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The UK and Japan decided to hold negotiations in Tokyo over the issue of Japanese troops blockading the British concession in Tianjin half a month ago. We commented at the time that these negotiations would inevitably be "protracted and inconclusive." Now, half a month has passed, and the negotiations have not yet begun, let alone completed. We do not rejoice in our accurate prediction but are apprehensive about the bleak future.</p>
<p>The UK wants to limit the scope of the Tianjin issue to a local incident. Not only have British officials, both directly and indirectly, expressed this view, but they have also revealed some subtle diplomatic tactics. The idea is that if Japan agrees that the issue is a local incident, then the UK will naturally be happy to seek a solution. Otherwise, involving the interests of the US and France, the UK has no right to make any decisions with Japan alone. In other words, if Japan wants to expand the scope of the Tianjin issue, then the UK, US, and France will have to work together to deal with Japan.</p>
<p>On the Japanese side, it has been said that the UK must accept the broad principles proposed by Japan, that is, the UK must change its attitude and abandon its pro-China policy. Otherwise, the Tokyo negotiations will have no results. However, the specific conditions for resolving the dispute will, of course, focus on the Tianjin issue. Assuming that we are not being paranoid, then we can infer that the so-called "must" is a pretense, a reversal, while the so-called "specific conditions focused on the Tianjin issue" implicitly accepts the British-advocated "local incident" principle.</p>
<p>The diplomatic qualities of the UK and Japan have always been known for their subtlety. Only last year when Japan resolved the Zhanggufeng Incident with the Soviet Union, and the UK signed the Munich Agreement with Germany, were they comparatively straightforward, which were exceptions. Because of this mutual appreciation for subtlety, coupled with the international situation in Europe and the political brewing in the Far East, there are many factors that give both sides room for fantasy. Therefore, no matter how the local incident principle proposed by the UK is ultimately implemented, it is not enough to optimistically predict the future of the Tokyo negotiations. But look at how the Japanese authorities, on the one hand, quietly say that the conditions for a resolution focus on the Tianjin issue; on the other hand, they create many well-organized and mechanical anti-British rallies both in Japan and in the militarily occupied areas of China, making a great show, booming and bustling, seemingly with the unanimous support of the people, and a soaring arrogance, enough to discourage political hypocrites and make them shrink back. It can be seen that although Japanese politicians do not expect any unexpected gains from the Tokyo negotiations, they still put on a show as much as possible, regardless of whether it is effective or not. Yesterday, they even used an informal and irresponsible way to publicize the so-called eight basic policies for the Tokyo negotiations: (1) Demand that the UK change its policies in all aspects of politics and economics; (2) Demand that the UK recognize the new political situation in East Asia; (3) Hand over all anti-Japanese terrorists and communist elements in the British concession in Tianjin; (4) Accept the cooperation of Japanese police and Japanese military police to maintain peace and order; (5) Prohibit the circulation of legal tender in the British concession; (6) Hand over 50 million yuan of silver belonging to Chinese banks in the concession; (7) Recognize the Japanese side's right to inspect Chinese banks and exchange shops; (8) Prohibit and curb anti-Japanese propaganda. This is truly the culmination of bargaining and an important posture on the eve of the start of negotiations!</p>
<p>We are just like some British politicians in their feelings: for example, former British Prime Minister Lloyd George said in a speech in Weaverham, UK, the other day that the UK's handling of the Tianjin incident has become a laughing stock among Europe and America, and that the British cabinet has lost its head; there are many, many expressions of dissatisfaction and unease like this, and it is certainly not just Lloyd George alone. Sometimes, we feel the same dissatisfaction and unease. But according to general morality and general reason, we also believe that the Chamberlain cabinet will not repeatedly break faith and disappoint people again and again. The Chamberlain cabinet once used a strong tone, stating that British foreign policy will never accept dictated orders; this certainly does not mean that it will only refuse to accept orders from Germany, but exceptionally be willing to accept dictation from Japan. But Japan wants the UK to accept as many as eight items of dictation!</p>
<p>We firmly believe that the UK will not regard the Tokyo negotiations as an opportunity to practice dictation; at the same time, we hope that the UK deeply recognizes that if Japan uses the opening of the Yangtze River for Anglo-Japanese cooperation as bait to get the UK to temporarily accept dictation, then what will be the psychology of all Chinese people towards the UK? How will the resentment provoked by reaction compare to other kinds of resentment? As for negotiations that exceed the scope of local incidents, the UK has to invite the US and France to work together. The UK may think that Japan does not want to risk such impropriety, so it tries to avoid the realization of joint efforts for the sake of Japan. In fact, after two years of war, the UK, France, and the US working together to deal with Japan may be what saves Japan from its desire to stop but its inability to do so; at least from the perspective of the overall situation in the Far East, it will surely have the function of stabilizing the Far East. If the UK can deeply recognize this, we firmly believe that the Tokyo negotiations will be more meaningful and make a greater contribution.</p>
<h3 id="e5">The Overall War Situation Will Soon Change - Feng Yuxiang Talks with Huitong News Agency Reporter - China Rushes to Train New Troops and Organize Resources - Conduct Counter-offensive to Change the Situation <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) General Feng Yuxiang, Deputy Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, met individually with Mr. M. M. Most, Far East General Manager of Huitong News Agency, yesterday and stated that although Japan's military equipment is superior to China's, the main principle of war is not just about military equipment. Therefore, the overall war situation will undergo significant changes soon. China is currently rushing to train new troops and organize resources, and will soon launch a counter-offensive to change the situation. For example, the recent setbacks suffered by the Japanese side in northwestern Hubei are clear evidence of this development. The Japanese army has lost 250 kilometers of territory, suffered 20,000 casualties, and countless military aircraft have been captured. The Japanese army in the Zhongtiao Mountains in Shanxi has launched nine attacks without any gains. Every day, 500 to 1,500 coffins of Japanese officers and soldiers are transported from the Baoding Railway. Feng continued that the Chinese authorities have received reliable information that 5,000 Japanese intellectuals have been put on trial by the Japanese government for demanding an immediate ceasefire. As a result, more than 400 people have been imprisoned and questioned. Other Japanese officials and civilians are tired of the war. According to reports received, Japanese soldiers on various fronts have recently shown great friendliness to the Chinese people, and some have even sworn allegiance to Chinese old women as adoptive mothers and vowed not to return to Japan. As for the Chinese side, morale is extremely strong. The army is entirely trained by Chinese officers and is well-equipped. When the Huitong reporter asked which units of the Chinese army are the best, Feng replied that the troops fighting around Yichang, as well as the new troops trained in Sichuan, Hunan, and Guizhou provinces, are the best in terms of combat effectiveness and fighting spirit. Finally, Feng said, "Therefore, all sacrifices are not in vain. The Chinese people have a deep belief in this, so they will continue the war of resistance until final victory."

<p>(Tokyo) The Anglo-Japanese talks on the Tianjin issue in Tokyo may be postponed until next week. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said this morning while hosting reporters that the Japanese government's discussion on the preparations for the Anglo-Japanese conference may take some time, so he could not confirm that the meeting could begin this week. Yesterday, officials from the Foreign and Army Ministries and representatives from Tianjin held a discussion, but it was informal and had no concrete results. It is said that a formal discussion will be held this afternoon. When reporters asked whether the Japanese government had responded to British Ambassador Craigie's two protests against the killing of British citizen Ding Gele by Japanese sailors in Pudong on June 6, the spokesman replied that he knew the matter was being handled in Shanghai. According to Reuters, the Japanese Foreign Ministry has not yet sent a reply to the British Embassy. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times today commented on the upcoming Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo, reiterating that only local issues related to Tianjin are appropriate for discussion. If it is proposed to expand the scope of issues, such as the general principles applicable to foreign concessions in various Chinese ports, it will not only affect the UK but also involve other countries. After listing various pieces of evidence that Japan has not succeeded two years after the war, the newspaper said that the Japanese people have not yet understood the intricate relationship of China's determination to resist. The failure to calculate has created a big mistake. In the eyes of the soldiers who made the mistake, foreigners are obviously scapegoats. However, the real reason for the prolongation of the war can only be attributed to a psychological error on the part of the Japanese General Staff. They now seem to be turning China into a kind of nation, just as Napoleon and his army and puppet government turned the historically divided and indifferent Germany into a nation determined to get rid of foreign control. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, Japanese newspapers, seemingly under official instruction, continued to express Japan's "fundamental determination" in the upcoming Tianjin issue negotiations, demanding that the UK abandon its "pro-Chiang policy" and strictly maintain neutrality. On this point, Miyako Shimbun stated that the Foreign Ministry has decided to accept the basic principles drafted by the Army Ministry. It is reported that the basic policies of the Army Ministry are: (1) Demand that the UK change its policies in all aspects of politics and economics; (2) Demand that the UK recognize the new political situation in East Asia; (3) Hand over all anti-Japanese terrorists and communist elements in the British concession in Tianjin; (4) Accept the cooperation of Japanese police and Japanese military police to maintain peace and order; (5) Prohibit the circulation of legal tender in the British concession; (6) Hand over 50 million yuan of silver belonging to Chinese banks in the concession; (7) Recognize the Japanese side's right to inspect Chinese banks and exchange shops; (8) Prohibit and curb anti-Japanese propaganda. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the Japanese actions of searching British people, after several days of easing, they have become stricter again today. At the Race Course Road intersection, four British people were searched by Japanese sentries for as long as forty minutes. One of them even had his shoes and socks taken off. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) Under-Secretary Butler declared in the House of Commons today, in response to a question from Labour MP Henderson, that the Japanese government has not formally presented its recent declaration by its Prime Minister Hiranuma concerning all the reservations in the upcoming Tokyo Anglo-Japanese talks. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) At the meeting of the House of Commons today, members again focused on the situation in Tianjin. Under-Secretary Butler, in answering questions, recounted that Prime Minister Chamberlain had told the House that the Tokyo negotiations would be conducted in accordance with the British government's push for an end to the atrocities perpetrated on the British people. These negotiations are expected to begin in the middle of next week. Judging from the information received by Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, some British people in Tianjin are now passing through obstacles, and the crackdown is not as troublesome as before. Conservative MP Sir Knox rose to speak, saying that action should of course be taken to stop the atrocities, and asked whether the UK's prestige in the Far East was in danger of being lost. The Under-Secretary replied that Knox should know that the situation has improved after the UK government's negotiations. Labour MP Fletcher rose to say that the UK government hopes that the atrocities perpetrated on the British people will end, but did not mention hoping that the blockade of Tianjin would end. The Under-Secretary replied that the UK government's attitude on this issue was stated by the Prime Minister on June 28. Fletcher then asked, "Is it true that the conditions regarding the blockade were not mentioned?" The Under-Secretary replied, "Yes, the situation is as Mr. Chamberlain said." Labour MP Noel-Baker asked whether the government could assure the House that if the negotiations began, the government would take no action that would harm the rights enjoyed by the Japanese government under international law, or recognize the legitimacy of the Japanese demands. The Under-Secretary replied, "I can give that assurance." (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e8">Supplementary Measures for Honoring the Descendants of the Loyal and Brave <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang is deeply concerned about the families of fallen soldiers and, in addition to the established procedures for various compensation regulations, has specially formulated several measures to supplement them: (1) Commanders of all units must promptly report the facts of death of their subordinates, as well as their ancestral origins and family circumstances, and quickly apply for compensation. No delays or backlogs are allowed. If the family situation is unclear in the existing records, a formal request should be sent to the original government for a detailed investigation and report. Do not delay due to negligence or arbitrarily postpone, so as to avoid omissions. (2) Local governments at all levels, when approving the compensation for the families of fallen soldiers, must issue the funds as soon as they arrive, regardless of financial difficulties. No excuses or delays are allowed. If such delays are discovered or reported by the families, severe punishment will be imposed without leniency. All families are allowed to report these facts to the Military Council Compensation Committee at any time to apply for prompt payment. (3) If any family is certain that their children have died in battle but has not received the compensation approval, they are allowed to directly report to the Compensation Committee, which will instruct the relevant unit commanders to investigate and apply for compensation. (4) If any family does not understand the written language or is unwilling to go through the compensation and payment procedures, the local Baotjia heads, gentry, or educators should voluntarily assist them in handling the matter if they are aware of it. Alternatively, in accordance with the preferential treatment measures for the families of soldiers on expeditions, local enthusiastic and capable individuals should find ways to maintain their livelihoods. This should be regarded as a supplement to Chairman Chiang's secret telegram to national gentry and educators on January 19, and earnestly promoted. If local governments and Baotjia personnel deliberately embezzle the compensation due to the families, they will be severely punished upon verification, regardless of the amount. (5) For families in occupied areas where administrative power cannot reach to provide relief, the local Baotjia and fellow villagers should remember that the martyrs died for the sake of protecting the country and defending the people, and should especially care for the descendants of the loyal and brave. They should either jointly raise funds to provide materials to support their lives, or take turns to help them with farming, so that they can avoid starvation and cold. After the recovery of the lost territories, in addition to the government verifying and compensating their families in accordance with the regulations, the families are also allowed to report the assistance provided by the Baotjia heads and neighbors, and the government will separately commend them to promote morality. (6) All civil and military personnel from central party, government, and military organs who are sent to the front and rear to inspect and review should immediately visit the relatives of fallen soldiers in each place they visit. They should inquire whether they have received the compensation they should have received in accordance with the regulations, and whether the preferential treatment laws and regulations have been effectively implemented by local governments and people. The actual situation should be reported to the Chairman for verification. The original sending organs of the central government should also include this as one of the assessment criteria for the diligence and merit of the dispatched personnel. (9th dispatch)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov held another meeting today with British Ambassador Seeds, French Ambassador Naggiar, and British Foreign Office Special Envoy Strang, holding closed-door talks for two hours and fifty minutes.

<p>(Moscow) Molotov again met today with British Ambassador Seeds, French Ambassador Naggiar, and British Foreign Office Special Envoy Strang for more than two hours, but no affirmative results were obtained. (9th TASS dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) French Ambassador to the Soviet Union Naggiar, British Ambassador Seeds, and Strang, Director of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, jointly visited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov this afternoon, holding talks for more than two hours. The duration was unprecedented since Strang's arrival in Moscow. The discussions reportedly concerned the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic states, as well as the issues of the Netherlands and Switzerland. Observers here claim that the two sides have been holding talks daily for the past three days, which shows that the negotiations are indeed progressing. However, due to the different aspects involved and the many issues, it will be several days before a definite result can be obtained. (9th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the progress of the tripartite negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Seeds recently submitted a report to the government. Prime Minister Chamberlain intends to convene the Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee within days to discuss it, possibly as early as tomorrow. Official circles refused to disclose the contents of the report and warned newspapers not to publish news prematurely before the time is ripe to avoid causing various inconveniences. According to well-informed sources, the Soviet government has proposed a new approach, striving to avoid the appearance of interference in the foreign policies of the guaranteed countries. The Soviet government seems eager to actively cooperate with Britain and France to establish an agreement as soon as possible. This situation has not been seen before. The reason is that the British government warned the Soviet government that Britain's concessions on the issue of mutual assistance when a third country is subjected to aggression have reached their limit. Soviet sources here advocate that Poland and Turkey should conclude mutual assistance agreements with the Soviet Union, saying that this would greatly benefit the peace front. (9th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources here recently claimed that the British authorities are currently drafting a new plan in case the current negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union fail.

(10th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met today, Labour MP Dalton and Conservative MP Adams successively raised inquiries about the progress of the negotiations on the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied that after the British and French governments separately telegraphed new instructions to their ambassadors in the Soviet Union, the two ambassadors continued their talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Foreign Minister Molotov immediately put forward some new proposals, which are now being studied by the British and French governments. However, the Soviet government has not yet responded to certain points in the proposals put forward by Britain and France. Another MP then asked what the government's attitude was regarding the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic states. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied, "Respect for the territorial integrity and sovereign independence of small countries is Britain's basic policy. As for Finland and the Baltic states, the British government is well aware that these countries are willing to maintain their independence and neutrality, and this is what the British government hopes for. Therefore, the British government will certainly take this into account in the current negotiations." Chamberlain also replied to Conservative MP Adams' inquiry that the government has no intention of sending Foreign Secretary Halifax to Moscow at this time. Adams then asked, "Would sending a British cabinet member to Moscow satisfy Oliver Twist (the protagonist in Charles Dickens' novel "Oliver Twist," known for his insatiable appetite, referring to the Soviet Union making progress step by step)?" The MPs burst into laughter upon hearing this. (10th Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e14">US Republican Congressman Opposes Buying Foreign Silver; Roosevelt Should Use It as a Weapon Against Those Who Harm US Interests <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Republican Senator Townsend, who recently introduced a bill to suspend the purchase of foreign silver, which is being discussed by the Senate Finance Subcommittee, told the press yesterday, "If friends of foreign silver believe that our country should give Mexico a disguised subsidy or loan, they should ask Congress to approve it. If the American people want to lend or give money to Mexico or any other country, it should also be decided by Congress. Economically speaking, the current silver purchase law is abnormal. If we maintain it at the request of foreign governments, it is equivalent to being defrauded and willingly succumbing, which is unacceptable." Since 1933, the United States has purchased $237,000,000 worth of silver from Latin American countries, of which $217,000,000 was produced by Mexico. What has been the result of the US purchase of Mexican silver in the past six years is obvious to all. (9th Havas)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Post Forum recently commented on the US policy of purchasing silver from foreign countries, saying, "There are many things about this policy that can be criticized, but it is not without benefit to oppress those countries when American interests in other countries are threatened." "There is no reason for our country to buy silver from foreign countries. If the government is determined to continue to implement this policy, it should be given full power, with conditions attached. What are the conditions? If the attitude of foreign governments is not conducive to American interests, and they take illegal actions, such as arbitrarily confiscating American assets, President Roosevelt should immediately use the power to buy silver as a weapon to oppress them, and when necessary, stop buying silver from those countries." (9th Havas)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Mail recently published an editorial, stating, "This week is a critical moment for President Roosevelt. The President's second term is about to expire, and his personal power has declined. It is not known whether his policy of assisting democratic countries can continue to be implemented. However, once war breaks out, American public opinion will quickly change and prompt Congress to take action, so that President Roosevelt's actions today will be consistent from beginning to end." (10th Havas)</p>
<p>(London) The issue of whether the United States should suspend the purchase of foreign silver is still under debate between Congress and the government. The silver market here has been greatly affected. There was a wave of selling at the opening, and buyers were insufficient, causing the price of silver to fall. Later, India bought some on the dip, and the market situation recovered. According to silver market officials, the current market price is still half a penny lower than the US purchase price. If the US government lowers the purchase price to be on par with the London market price, the London market price will continue to fall tomorrow. However, if the US maintains the current price, sellers may rush to replenish their positions, and the market price may rise sharply. (10th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) Regarding the rumors of a cabinet reshuffle, the Daily Mail recently reported, "A noteworthy situation has arisen within the Conservative Party. Many party members have requested a large-scale cabinet reshuffle, especially at the end of last week. Prime Minister Chamberlain also had this intention a week or two ago. Today, the Prime Minister has decided to postpone the cabinet reshuffle indefinitely, regardless of everything. The reason is that those who advocate a cabinet reshuffle all support Churchill, the leader of the far-right wing of the Conservative Party, to join the cabinet. However, no one has paid attention to what position he should hold. Prime Minister Chamberlain therefore had a feeling that once Churchill joined the cabinet, no matter what position he held, most members of the Conservative Party would see him as controlling the power of the cabinet. The proposal for a cabinet reshuffle became a provocative act against Prime Minister Chamberlain himself, so he decided to maintain the status quo, and Churchill was therefore disadvantaged."

<h3 id="e18">Chamberlain Reaffirms British Attitude Toward Danzig Situation; If Polish Independence is Clearly Threatened, Britain Will Fulfill Its Promise to Provide Assistance <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain made a highly anticipated statement on Danzig in the House of Commons today, saying that we have assured Poland that if its independence is clearly threatened and it believes it necessary to resist with all its national strength, we will provide assistance. We have now decided to implement this guarantee. I have previously stated that the British government has maintained close contact with the French and Polish governments regarding the Danzig issue. I have no more to add to the information I have previously released regarding the situation there. However, I will make a useful review of the factors of this issue seen by the British government. In terms of race, Danzig is almost entirely a German city, but the prosperity of its residents largely depends on Polish trade. The Vistula River is Poland's only waterway to the Baltic Sea, so the seaport at the entrance of the river is of great importance to Poland's military strategy and economy. If another strong country were to gain a foothold in Danzig, it could, at will, block Poland's access to the Baltic Sea and inflict economic and military blows. All those responsible for formulating the current Free City regulations are well aware of this fact and have tried their best to stipulate the articles accordingly. There is no issue of oppressing the Germans in Danzig, and the administration of the Free City is now in the hands of the Germans. The only restrictions imposed are not a kind of exploitation of the freedom of citizens. The current solution, although not without room for improvement, cannot be considered fundamentally unfair or illogical in itself. In fact, the maintenance of the status quo of Danzig was personally guaranteed by the German leader and the late Polish General Piłsudski when they signed the ten-year agreement until 1944. Before March of this year, although Germany seemed to feel that the status of Danzig needed to be modified, it did not consider this issue to be urgent or about to cause a serious dispute. However, in March, the German government suddenly made a demand to Poland in the form of extortion and supplemented it with a propaganda campaign. The Polish government realized that it might encounter the danger of a unilateral solution and had to resist with all its strength. Poland witnessed that the current facts were no different from what happened in Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Memel, so it refused to accept the German proposal and put forward possible solutions to the issues that Germany was concerned about. The Polish government took some self-defense measures on March 23 and replied to Berlin on March 26. I ask the House to pay close attention to these dates. Germany is now widely rumored that the Polish government's actions I mentioned were caused by the guarantee given by the British government. It should be known that the British government's guarantee was only given to Poland as late as March 31. On March 26, this was not even mentioned to the Polish government. The recent incidents in Danzig have made people fear that the future status of Danzig will be resolved through unilateral actions organized by secret and improper means, and that Poland and other powers will be shown the accomplished fact. Therefore, any action taken by Poland in this situation to restore the overall situation can be called an act of aggression. If other powers support Poland's actions, they can be blamed for assisting and instigating Poland to use force. If the result of the incident is as imagined by such speculation, then the members of the House should understand that this dispute cannot be regarded as a purely local incident involving the rights and freedoms of the residents of Danzig. In fact, their rights and freedoms have not been threatened at all, and it will immediately cause a more serious dispute related to the survival and independence of the Polish state. We have given Poland a guarantee that if Poland's independence is clearly threatened and it believes it necessary to resist this threat with all its national strength, Britain is willing to come to its aid. We are determined to implement this guarantee. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Danzig The National Socialist newspapers here made a preemptive response to British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech on Danzig before he even delivered it.

The Nazi Party branch held a large meeting here this afternoon, where the leader, Forster, gave a speech, roughly stating that the Free City of Danzig has a Germanic character, even more so now than in the past. Once merged with Germany, the living conditions of the citizens will greatly improve. Even if living conditions worsen, no one would not long to be merged with Germany. Currently, the Polish government has built an arsenal in the Westerplatte area near the port of Danzig, which poses a permanent threat to the Free City of Danzig and the port. Since the city of Danzig cannot store weapons within its borders, Poland should not have this right either. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Danzig. Nazi Party leader Forster gave a speech to the public here today. When he spoke of the good neighbor Poland in a sarcastic tone, the audience erupted in jeers and shouts of "Poles must disappear from Danzig." Forster claimed that the desire of the people of Danzig to return to Germany is stronger now than ever before. The Polish Corridor is a victim of the Versailles fraud, and Danzig will eventually return to Germany. However, Forster's speech today gave the impression that his words were slightly milder than half a month ago. When a Reuters reporter was recording his speech on the spot, a stormtrooper suddenly stepped forward to question him. The Reuters reporter replied that he represented a British newspaper.

<p>Forster Warns Poland</p>
<p>Danzig. Nazi Party Danzig District Leader Forster delivered a speech in Oliva yesterday, discussing the relationship between Danzig and Poland, declaring that the people of Danzig have the right to demand that Danzig become a part of Germany and will demand to merge with Germany. The opinions of the few Poles in Danzig are not worth considering, because the status of the few Germans in Poland is not valued by Poland at all. The Polish diplomatic representative in Danzig acts like a High Commissioner in Danzig, which is ridiculous. The Poles in Danzig are fundamentally in a guest position, and their words have no weight. Forster then spoke at the Neufahrwasser port, demanding that Poland remove the Polish arsenal in Danzig, and claiming that Danzig's demand for return to Germany has the following three guarantees: (1) Hitler's spokesman Goebbels once said that 80 million Germans unanimously support the people of Danzig; (2) the German army is the most elite army in the world and also unanimously supports the people of Danzig; (3) the young and strong men of the Danzig Germanic race are all willing to bear arms to defend their homeland.

This guarantee was provided to the Danzig Nazi Party by German Propaganda Minister Goebbels during his recent visit to Danzig. Forster declared, "80 million Germans are behind us. The German army is the best army in the world. The people of Danzig can take up arms to defend themselves when necessary." (Associated Press, 10th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The "Frankfurter Zeitung" recently published an article commenting on the economic development of the city of Danzig after its customs union with Poland in the past 20 years. The article roughly stated, "Since 1919, the economic development of the city of Danzig, according to our research, has made us deeply feel that the Polish government has not used the resources of the city of Danzig to benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood, and has obstructed the efforts of the citizens of Danzig to strive for prosperity. The Polish government has adopted this policy in order to make the city of Danzig economically controlled by Poland, and then politically and culturally suppress the city of Danzig. After the customs of the city of Danzig were merged with Poland, the Polish government used it to control the foreign affairs of the city of Danzig. Commercial agreements signed by Poland with foreign countries, except for those whose interests of the city of Danzig are indirectly the same as those of Poland, do not take into account the interests of the city of Danzig."

<h3 id="e26">Italian Newspaper Proposes Axis Powers' Peace Terms, Italy Demands French Territories in Africa, Germany Demands Danzig and Former Colonies <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) The Fascist Party's newspaper "Il Regime Fascista" recently published an article explaining the peace terms that the Berlin-Rome Axis can accept. The article roughly stated, "If the Danzig Free City issue can be resolved according to Germany's demands, the European war crisis can be swept away. To this day, if European countries are truly willing to seek appeasement, thereby limiting armaments, implementing economic cooperation, and laying the foundation for lasting and constructive peace, then the French territory of Tunisia in North Africa and the French port of Djibouti in East Africa should be transferred to Italy. The Suez Canal should be under Italian control. The original territories of Spain, such as the British port of Gibraltar, should also be returned to Spain. Only then can the Mediterranean become a free sea, and we can guarantee Britain's right to free navigation in the Mediterranean. Furthermore, Germany's demands regarding the recovery of the Free City of Danzig and its former colonies must also be implemented. Since the Entente powers of Britain and France have forced Germany and Italy to compete in armaments by implementing power politics, if Germany and Italy are to restore their usual economic structure, they must be financially assisted and agreements must be concluded with them so that they can obtain various necessary raw materials without having to use their gold reserves. This is what fairness dictates. In addition, all actions that contain provocative implications for the totalitarian states, as well as the abuse of German and Italian expatriates, must be stopped. As for the Jewish issue, it should be resolved jointly by all countries by relocating the Jews outside of Europe (excluding the Pakistan region). If Britain and France still have doubts about the German-Italian Axis regarding all these measures and whether we can live in peace with each other, then we can answer that Prime Minister Mussolini wants to seek peace in justice. We only need to obtain justice, and we are willing to guarantee the peace of Britain and France. However, as things stand, we do not initially expect that our proposals will be accepted by the other party. Therefore, how the situation will develop is beyond our prediction. In our opinion, the Entente powers will obtain peace at a higher price, and perhaps only after paying an extremely high price." (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The British sex psychologist Havelock Ellis passed away at his home in Hintlesham near Ipswich today at the age of 80. Havelock Ellis was born on February 1, 1859, in Croydon, Surrey. His father was a cargo ship captain. Ellis sailed with his father in his childhood and had traveled around the world by the age of eight. He then became deeply interested in medicine. After completing his studies, he served at St Thomas' Hospital here. When his first work on sex psychology was published, it was severely criticized by the people of the country, so it was published in the United States instead. His book "Studies in the Psychology of Sex" was prosecuted by the London court in 1898 for obscenity. As of today, he is generally recognized as a master of sex psychology. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<h3 id="e28">Unexpected Incident Occurs on the Hai River in Tianjin, Japanese Soldiers Open Fire as a Tugboat Passes By, Wounding Three People <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At 2:00 PM today, an unexpected incident occurred on the Hai River in the British sector, resulting in three people being injured and admitted to the hospital. The incident involved the tugboat "Saxon" of the Dagu Tug and Lighter Company. As the tugboat was towing a cargo ship upstream, a Chinese sampan attempted to hook onto the cargo ship to ride along. A Japanese soldier from the former German Concession on the opposite bank suddenly opened fire, hitting the head of the helmsman of the tugboat. A Chinese sailor from the "Saxon" was also shot in the arm. The Japanese soldier then shot the owner of the sampan, and the bullet entered his chest. The three boats quickly sailed to the British Concession riverside to moor. The three injured were rushed to the Victoria Hospital. It is reported that the helmsman's injuries are serious. The British police are investigating the incident. The British Consul General Jameson has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese authorities regarding this matter. It was found that the bullets were aimed at the British Concession riverside, but it is strange that no one in the Concession was injured by stray bullets, as there are often many Chinese and some foreigners on the riverside to escape the heat, and a little further away is Victoria Road, the main road in Tianjin, with tall buildings along the road, which are the locations of offices. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Today, along the Bai River in the former Russian Concession, a Japanese patrolman shot at a sampan man who fled into a British Dagu barge, causing the boatman to be injured in the chest and hand. At the same time, a Chinese sailor on the barge was also shot twice, once in the head and once in the hand. Another sailor was injured in the leg. The British Consul, after studying the case tonight, has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese side, believing that the Japanese soldiers' shooting at British ships was purely intentional. Moreover, the width of the Bai River is only about 100 yards here. If bullets are fired indiscriminately from the opposite bank, they will inevitably fall into the British Concession.

<h3 id="e30">British and French Army, Navy, and Air Force Generals Gather in Singapore for Joint Defense Talks; Important Decisions Made Regarding Countermeasures in the Far East; Official Statement Only States All Agreements Reached Were Consistent; US and Netherlands Closely Monitoring the Conference <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Singapore Correspondence: The British-French Far East Joint Defense Conference, convened to protect interests in the Far East, although international relations prevented the United States and the Netherlands from formally sending representatives, in reality, both countries are taking the same steps as Britain and France. Therefore, this conference can be considered a British-French Far East Defense Joint Conference, and it can also be considered a Democratic Nations' Far East Joint Defense Conference.</p>
<p>The conference began on June 23rd in Singapore. It was announced beforehand that 60 representatives would participate, including important British and French Far East army, navy, and air force generals. However, only 44 officially attended the conference. It is believed that the remaining dozen or so were staff secretaries, etc. The conference was originally scheduled for a week, but it actually ended after only five days. The reasons for shortening the conference time were due to: (1) the French General Staff and its delegation's thorough preparation; (2) preparatory meetings held before the main conference to ensure smooth and rapid progress. However, the strict blockade of the British concession in Tianjin and the Japanese army's occupation of Shantou during the conference posed a greater threat to British and French interests, making the situation even more tense and necessitating early preparation, which was also a major reason for the early conclusion of the conference.</p>
<p>This conference was purely confidential, held in the gymnasium of an army camp, guarded by soldiers, and no one other than representatives could enter. However, because of its special importance, not only Japan and Germany paid attention, but people all over the world were watching. Therefore, English newspaper reporters still tried to gather information in various ways. The chairman of the conference was Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Fleet. His effective command and ability to handle matters gave a good impression to the representatives, who admired his superb military knowledge and unique grasp of special Far East issues, which further impressed the representatives. From the morning of the 22nd until the announcement of its conclusion on the 26th, during these five days, plenary sessions were held every morning, and in the afternoon, three subcommittees of the navy, army, and air force were conducted until 6 pm. Meetings were also held for several hours on Sundays. The tense situation can be easily imagined.</p>
<p>The news of the Japanese army's occupation of Shantou, conveyed to the generals in the meeting by Reuters reporters, aroused great attention. It was widely believed that there would be important discussions and decisions on how Britain and France should deal with the rampant behavior of the Japanese army in China. How to prevent Japan from advancing southward was also hotly debated on the third day of the conference. It was believed that the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island and the Spratly Islands, and the establishment of fishing grounds or other bases in the western islands of Malaya should not be ignored. Finally, important decisions were made, especially regarding the protection of the oil fields in North Borneo.</p>
<p>The attitude of Siam was also given the utmost attention in the conference. Siam, located between Malaya, Burma, and Annam, holds the key to the decisive battle in the Far East, so it is naturally impossible not to pay attention to it. During the conference, Mr. Bischoff, Air Defense Advisor to the Burmese government, reported on Siam's true attitude. Bischoff also served as Siam's Air Force Counsellor and was more familiar with the situation. Siam's traditional friendly relations with Britain have not been shaken to this day. Although the Japanese side has tried hard to persuade Siam to join the Fascist camp, in fact, Siam is still regarded as the Belgium of Europe, and it is generally expected that Siam will inevitably stand on the side of Britain and France during the war.</p>
<p>In summary, according to information from relevant parties, the conference made the following eight important resolutions: (1) the issue of unified command of the British and French armies in the Far East, with the Commander-in-Chief being Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Fleet, and the headquarters located in Singapore; (2) the merger of British and French armaments and resources in wartime; (3) drafting a combat plan and first studying the strengths of the Japanese navy in order to cope with it when war breaks out; (4) actively rebuilding the Cam Ranh Bay naval base in Annam into a "Singapore of France" military port with the joint efforts of Britain and France; (5) protecting British and French concessions in China; (6) protecting British and French merchant ships in the Far East; (7) protecting transportation lines in the Far East; (8) the mutual relations between Britain and France, Siam, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies. When a reporter asked Brigadier General Binden, Director of the local Defense Intelligence Office, about the above eight items, he could not agree to be responsible for confirming them.</p>
<p>However, at the close of the conference, a notice was issued, stating that the conference concluded on the 26th. After the closing, Mr. Noble immediately took his flagship back to the waters off North China. All reports in the newspapers about the conference were nothing more than speculation and were not officially provided by responsible authorities. However, all agreements reached at this conference regarding countermeasures for all issues were consistent. This public announcement is boilerplate, but it is included here for readers' reference.</p>
<p>Regarding the relationship between the conference and the United States and the Netherlands, the public part was to notify the authorities of the two countries of the results of the conference at any time. According to telegrams obtained by local English newspapers, American newspapers covered this conference with great fanfare. The Manila Bulletin, founded by the United States in the Philippines, even published an editorial on the opening day of the conference offering its opinions. In the Dutch East Indies, a Dutch newspaper in Batavia specially sent a reporter to Singapore to report on the conference news. People in Batavia also advocated selecting important officials to liaise with the conference. There was also a rumor that important Dutch generals took advantage of their holidays to go to Singapore to meet with the generals and discuss defense issues. In fact, the close relationship between the Netherlands and the United States and the conference can be seen in the phrase "the conference resolutions were notified to the United States and the Netherlands."</p>
<p>Admiral Noble was originally scheduled to leave Singapore on the 26th, but finally departed on the morning of the 27th. The reason: waiting to meet with the Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Navy, who was going to Britain to report to the Admiralty on Pacific defense work. Both Chinese and English newspapers in Singapore predicted that Britain's flexible attitude towards Japan would be proven after Noble arrived in the China Sea. (Yi Sheng) A special dispatch from Shantou: Senior British and French army, navy, and air force officers stationed in the Far East held a meeting in the Singapore naval port to deal with the Far East crisis. The location of the meeting was absolutely kept secret beforehand and was held at the headquarters on Canning Hill in Singapore. Rumors that it was held on the HMS Kent or in the Tanglin Barracks were just speculation. When the meeting opened at noon on the 22nd, Reuters news about the Japanese army's occupation of Shantou and the Japanese army's deadline for British and American ships to withdraw from Shantou by 1:00 pm had been delivered to the conference table. The representatives attached great importance to it. In view of the serious situation on the Chinese coast, they discussed the Japanese navy's blockade of the mainland and countermeasures. A battalion of the army was dispatched near the meeting place, with strict precautions. The conference did not come to a successful conclusion until the 26th. Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Fleet, and General Garnett, Commander-in-Chief of the Army in China, left Singapore on the HMS Kent on the 27th and arrived in Hong Kong at 10:00 am on July 1st. Because the resolutions of the conference were of great significance, the news was specially recorded from a certain source.</p>

<p>Conference Procedures</p>
<p>The British-French Far East Military Joint Defense Conference was guarded by more than a battalion of armed forces, and the situation was extremely serious and tense. The preliminary procedures of the conference have been completed, and it has been decided in principle that the two countries, Britain and France, will carry out military cooperation in the Far East. It is claimed that this conference will not involve the political issues of other countries. The authorities have made an official announcement stating that the procedures for this conference are as follows: (1) the issue of the supreme commander in the event of war between Britain and France in the Far East. It has been decided that the supreme commander will be Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Fleet; (2) the issue of cooperation between the military forces of Britain and France in the Far East; (3) mutual assistance and protection of each other's territorial waters and airspace by the navy and air force; (4) mutual use of airfields and military ports; (5) joint protection of the commercial transportation of the two countries in the Far East. This conference is indeed closely related to the United States, the Netherlands, and Australia in the Far East and the Pacific. Although no formal representatives have been sent to participate, the progress of the conference is reported to the authorities of those countries in an informal manner. The main topic of the conference is the allocation of the subcommittees and their personnel, but in principle, absolute military cooperation between Britain and France in the Far East has been achieved. However, the content of the conference is absolutely kept secret by the authorities. Under the protection of a large armed force, no one is allowed to approach the conference site, so outsiders know very little about it. It is also said that the greatest task of this conference is to maximize the effectiveness of Britain and France in the Far East when a war breaks out with an enemy country. At a minimum, the following plans must be completed: (1) to deal with Japan's unilateral oppression of the Far Eastern powers during the troubled times in Europe; (2) to consider the possible forms of war that will inevitably be triggered in the Far East when the European war breaks out.</p>
<p>Based on this conference, it is necessary to consider how to utilize the manpower and resources of various places, supplemented by modern military equipment, to enhance the self-defense capabilities of the countries and reduce Europe's worries about the East.</p>

<p>Changxing Correspondence: After the Japanese troops captured Changxing, they immediately occupied the Changyi Coal Mine. Last month, Changyi was recovered by the Chinese army. The coal that was mined could not be exported by the Japanese troops. On the afternoon of July 9th, 130 Japanese troops from Jiapu Town (under the jurisdiction of Wuxing County) on the west bank of Taihu Lake, boarded large and small motorboats and sneaked into Changjing in an attempt to rob and transport the accumulated coal blocks. However, they were discovered early by the Chinese army in Changxing, which immediately sent troops to ambush them at Longtou Mountain. One motorboat was sunk on the spot, and three were damaged. About 40 Japanese troops were killed or wounded. The Chinese army tracked and pursued them to Jiapu, captured and executed the bandit leader Xu Fenwen and others, and the remaining bandits fled in all directions.

<h3 id="e33">Qualifications, Appointments, and Treatment of Higher Education Faculty Nationwide (Part 2) <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>More Concrete Qualification Standards After the Establishment of the National Government</p>
<p>(3) The Era of the National Government</p>
<p>The former Educational Administration Committee promulgated the Regulations on the Qualifications of University Faculty in June of the 16th year of the Republic of China, dividing university faculty into four grades: first grade, professor; second grade, associate professor; third grade, lecturer; and fourth grade, teaching assistant. Those with one of the following qualifications may serve as teaching assistants: (1) Graduates of domestic or foreign universities with a bachelor's degree and considerable achievements; (2) Those who have made achievements in Chinese studies. Those with one of the following qualifications may serve as lecturers: (a) Graduates of domestic or foreign universities with a master's degree and considerable achievements; (b) Teaching assistants who have completed more than one year of teaching and have made special achievements; (3) Those who have made contributions in Chinese studies. Those with one of the following qualifications may serve as associate professors: (a) Those who have studied in foreign university graduate schools for several years and have obtained a doctoral degree with considerable achievements; (b) Lecturers who have completed more than one year of teaching and have made special achievements; (4) Those who have made special contributions in Chinese studies. Those who have served as associate professors for more than two years of teaching and have made special achievements may serve as professors. The organization that reviews the qualifications of faculty members is the university's council. During the review, a representative from the central educational administrative agency attends as a nonvoting member. Qualified faculty members are recognized by the central educational administrative agency and given certificates. This is the beginning of the qualification review that university faculty members should undergo, and it is also the characteristic of this regulation. However, in fact, universities did not establish councils, and the qualification review of university faculty members was not implemented. The appointment of university faculty members is based on the provisions of the University Organization Law. The deans are appointed by the president, and the department heads and professors, associate professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants of each department are appointed by the president after consultation with the deans. In addition to the salary scales for university faculty members announced by the former Educational Administration Committee in the 16th year of the Republic of China, there are no detailed regulations on the treatment of university faculty members. As for the faculty members of specialized schools, they are divided into full-time and part-time, according to the Organization Law of Specialized Schools, and are appointed by the principal. There are no explicit regulations on qualifications and treatment.</p>
<p>The above is the evolution of the regulations on the qualifications, appointment, and treatment of faculty members in schools above the specialized level. Let's try to analyze it. Each period has its own characteristics. In the early days of schools in the late Qing Dynasty, the various regulations for faculty members were only general provisions in principle. This was necessary in fact because the school system was newly established. Its characteristic was that faculty members were all listed as officials, such as supervisors, directors, supervising officials, and inspectors. Officials were appointed by the government, so there were no explicit regulations on how to review and select faculty qualifications or how to appoint them, which implicitly meant that they were controlled by the government. During the period of the Beijing government, the names of university faculty members were initially divided into two types: professors and teaching professors, and then into four types: full professors, professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants, which was more detailed than in the late Qing Dynasty. However, except for private universities and specialized schools, the standards for faculty qualifications were not strictly defined, and the methods for qualification review were not specified in detail. Other aspects such as faculty appointment, treatment, and service were all subject to established regulations and detailed planning. The regulations stipulated that the number of faculty members in each school must first be approved by the Ministry of Education, the president should be recommended by the school to the Ministry for appointment, full-time faculty members should be employed by the school and reported to the Ministry for approval, and part-time faculty members should be employed by the school and reported to the Ministry for record. The regulations were quite strict. After the sixth year of the Republic of China, the appointment of faculty members in national universities was not as strict as before, but the regulations on treatment, tenure, further studies, retirement, and pensions were more detailed. During the period of the Beijing government, the various regulations for faculty members in schools above the specialized level gradually became more detailed, but attention was not yet paid to the review of qualifications. After the establishment of the National Government, the standards for the qualifications of university faculty members were more concrete, and it was stipulated that they must undergo qualification review. The review organization was responsible to the university council, but it was not actually implemented. The method of appointment was still by the president, but it was necessary to consult with the deans, and the treatment was only generally determined in terms of amount, without division into grades. Other aspects such as security and further studies were not subject to established regulations. Except for the slight regulations in the Organization Law of Specialized Schools, no detailed regulations have been established for the faculty members of specialized schools. In view of this, the Ministry of Education has been thinking about revising a reasonable and practical set of regulations for the various regulations for faculty members of universities and specialized schools in recent years, in order to implement them. The issue of faculty members is deeply and greatly related to the essence of university and specialized education, and it is necessary to establish a good standard and uniform regulations in order to improve the essence and raise the level. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be done hastily. If the regulations are too idealistic, they will be difficult to implement. If they are too broad, they will not help in practice. It is necessary to refer to past systems, refer to the established laws of various countries, and carefully stipulate the actual situation of each school, so that practical results can be achieved. It is said that the Ministry of Education is paying attention to research in order to make improvements. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e34">Guangxi's Annual Adult Education Implementation Measures; Adult Education Must Be Popularized Within This Year <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Guilin Correspondence) Guangxi has designated the 28th year as the Year of Adult Education, which was reported in previous newspapers. The implementation measures are recorded below:</p>
<p>Administrative Organization It is stipulated that the 28th year is the Year of Adult Education in Guangxi Province. Political power will be used to mobilize intellectuals to thoroughly popularize adult education within this year. The province has established an Adult Education Year Promotion Committee, and each county has also established a committee to promote the implementation of various undertakings.</p>
<p>Enrollment and Compilation It is stipulated that illiterate adults of both sexes aged 18 to 45 and those who cannot yet read and understand the texts of the first two books of the People's School textbooks should all enroll in school. The county government and the village and street offices of each township are responsible for the investigation. If there are absences, they will be punished in accordance with the provincial order. An absence of three days will result in a fine of five jiao in national currency or one day of labor. This will be applied by analogy for absences exceeding three days. For absences of more than one month, in addition to the fine or labor, they will be ordered to repeat the course. Those who should enroll in school but do not enroll after persuasion, or who are absent from school without reason after enrolling, and do not comply with paying the fine or performing labor service, may be detained by the county government as a warning. However, the detention period shall not exceed three days at most.</p>
<p>The province is divided into four periods to complete adult education, so illiterate adults also enroll in school in four periods. (1) Enroll in school in periods by drawing lots. (2) Illiterate adults who are family members of village, township, and street chiefs and other civil servants must enroll in school in the first period. (3) Those who voluntarily enroll in advance should be given priority. (4) If there are two or more adults in a family who should enroll in school and are drawn in the same period, they can enroll in periods. As for the compilation of adult classes, each class should have a minimum of 25 students and a maximum of 50 students, and classes should be divided by gender in principle.</p>
<p>Curriculum and Teaching Materials The weekly curriculum for adult classes is based on the regulations of the Guangxi Provincial Government and includes the following items: (1) Anti-Japanese speeches (including memorial weeks) for two hours; (2) National language for nine hours; (3) Current affairs reports for one hour; (4) Anti-Japanese songs for one and a half hours; (5) Assembly activities for half an hour.</p>
<p>Teacher Training Teacher sources: (1) Transferring directors of the guidance departments of central basic schools; (2) Transferring teachers from basic schools at all levels; (3) Transferring surplus teachers after the adjustment of each county in accordance with the province's wartime basic education implementation measures; (4) If there are not enough teachers, civil servants and intellectuals may be conscripted to supplement them. Before the implementation of adult education, all teachers will be given special training to meet the needs of the times. As for teacher treatment, each adult class will receive a subsidy of five yuan after it is completed. However, teachers of adult classes organized by various groups will not receive subsidies. Teachers of adult classes are exempt from the obligation to perform military service or corvée during their service period.</p>
<p>Estimated Expenses The province will eliminate illiteracy throughout the province in four periods within one year. The estimated expenses for this year are as follows: (1) The total number of illiterate people is 1,863,995. Based on 40 people per class, 46,600 classes should be organized. These will be organized in four periods, with 11,700 classes in each period. (2) The total number of teachers required is 5,850. Each teacher teaches two classes per period. 2,291 directors of the guidance departments of central basic schools and 3,559 teachers from basic schools and surplus teachers will be transferred.

<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the population in the two concession areas has suddenly increased sharply. Most of the students in the war zones of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have fled to Shanghai with them, resulting in a mushrooming increase in the number of schools established in the concession areas, and the education industry has become a deformed development. However, it is difficult to accurately investigate the number of students. According to investigators, the number of high school and primary school students has indeed increased sharply since the war, reaching more than 50,000 people. There are now more than 140,000 high school and primary school students in public and private schools in the city, and more than 40,000 students in schools affiliated with the Municipal Council's Education Department.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The 1939-40 Hong Kong Football League closed its registration as usual on June 30th. Although there are still two days before the start of the season, registration must be closed by the end of June. This year's annual meeting is scheduled for the 10th of this month. Before the annual meeting, the General Association may still accept any teams that wish to complete registration procedures. As of yesterday's registration results, a total of eleven teams have registered for Group A. The South China Athletic Association will still be divided into A and B teams. If the British Army East Surrey regiment is transferred to Hong Kong for stationing and sends a football team to participate in Group A, the number can be increased to twelve teams. The Middlesex Regiment will be succeeded by the new recruits of the Northampton Battalion. The number of teams in Group A will still be maintained at no more than twelve. As for the talk of the Chinese Football Association wanting to re-establish itself in Group A and the Artillery team wanting to return to Group A, it was once very loud, but recently they have not registered, and it seems to be in vain. Eleven teams have participated in Group B. The list is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e48">Finance: Foreign Exchange Remains Stable; Gold Market Not as Buoyant as Expected <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Goods Imported by the Tianjin Banking Community Last Weekend: All Re-emerge; Market Price, If Based on Off-Exchange Gray Market: Drops Ten Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's cash scarlet gray market situation: The opening momentum was not as strong as on the previous holiday, as the general operators' expectations from last weekend failed to materialize. This was because the British and American exchange markets were extremely stable today, causing buyers to hesitate and mostly wait and see. Therefore, the morning opening dropped to 2,580 yuan. Although the Hong Kong banking community still showed interest and wealthy merchants from the wood market frequently absorbed, a certain money exchange firm released all the goods it had imported last weekend, and securities firms also sold more than they bought. Therefore, the balance of supply and demand remained stable, with little change, hovering between 2,580 and 2,590 yuan. As a result, it increased by eight yuan compared to last Saturday's noon closing, but it actually fell by more than ten yuan compared to the previous day's off-exchange gray market. Trading was brisk in the morning, around 600 taels, but it suddenly cleared up in the afternoon, with only a few dozen taels. Jewelers raised the price of jewelry gold by two yuan. The prices of Customs Gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Scarlet Only Increases by Eight Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels), the opening momentum was weak and not as firm as on the previous holiday. This was because after noon last weekend, there were sudden rumors of a major contraction in the Tianjin foreign exchange market, so some operators expected that the Shanghai foreign exchange market might be slightly affected on Monday. However, because the potential of the British and American exchange markets was extremely stable today, people's hearts turned tired, and buyers waited and watched, causing the price to drop from 2,590 yuan to 80 yuan before a transaction was seen. First, the cash firm gave its jeweler 50 taels, priced at 2,580 yuan, which was 20 yuan lower than the previous day's off-exchange gray market, but 3 yuan higher than last Saturday's noon closing. After the opening, the Hong Kong banking community showed excellent interest, and securities firms also showed buying intentions. Therefore, although a certain money exchange firm was selling, the position still felt that demand exceeded supply, and the market momentum rose upward. In a flash, it rose by five yuan. The jewelers bought 50 taels from a certain money exchange firm, priced at 85 yuan, and then rose by another yuan. A certain gold firm (acting on behalf of the Hong Kong banking community) bought 50 taels from a certain money exchange firm, priced at 86 yuan. Later, it rose by another four yuan. The securities firm bought 50 taels from the jewelers, priced at 90 yuan. Then, a certain gold firm (on behalf of the Hong Kong banking community) and a money exchange firm successively absorbed, with the money exchange firm totaling 100 taels, all at the same price. At that time, the buying momentum gradually weakened, and the market turned tired. The jewelers sold 20 taels to the securities firm, priced at 88 yuan. Before long, the securities firm immediately sold 20 taels back to the cash firm, priced at 87 yuan. Later, the securities firm forcefully sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange firm (on behalf of a wealthy merchant in this city), priced at only 82 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange firm still strongly absorbed on behalf of the wealthy, and the situation tended to stabilize. A certain money exchange firm bought 50 taels from a fellow firm, priced at 85 yuan, and then bought 30 taels each from the securities firm and a certain silver house, both priced at 84 yuan. Later, a certain silver house again absorbed 50 taels from the securities firm on behalf of the Hong Kong banking community, priced at 86 yuan. At noon, a certain money exchange firm again absorbed 50 taels from a gold firm on behalf of a wealthy merchant, priced at 85 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the transaction was extremely clear, and the market situation was also flat. Only the jewelers sold 10 taels to a gold firm and 20 taels to a money exchange firm, priced at 2,585 yuan, which was the evening closing price. As a result, it increased by eight yuan compared to last weekend, but it was more than ten yuan lower than the previous day's off-exchange gray market. The entire day fluctuated by ten yuan. The cash firm's own gold was priced ten yuan higher than the scarlet price. The current standard gold was priced about fifty yuan lower than the listed gold. According to inquiries, there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold is Listed One Yuan Higher</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael was initially unchanged, but at noon it was listed one yuan higher. There were no changes after that. The Datonghang revised its listing to 262 yuan, the Xintonghang to 260 yuan, and the buying price to 254 yuan. The Central Bank's buying price for Chinese cash remained at 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed price for Customs Gold remained at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained stable at 1,207 yuan and 6 jiao, which was due to the London telegram of the 8th, stating that British pure gold was still at £7, 8 shillings, 6 pence, and 10.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Japanese Notes Rise Significantly <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Last Saturday, British pure gold and the British-American exchange rate remained unchanged. Yesterday, the foreign exchange in this city saw brisk settlements from foreign firms. Foreign banks provided ample supply, and the market was stable and uneventful. Scarlet opened weakly, making a low of 2,580 yuan, down 14 yuan from last Saturday's gray market. After entering, jewelers and gold firms showed strong buying intentions, rising to 90 yuan. The noon closing was 85 yuan. In the afternoon, trading was sparse and the market price did not change, up 8 yuan from Saturday. Foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, were in scarce demand. The price of gold rose overtly but fell covertly. The British gold pound fell back, and British and American gold notes traded briskly. Because the market price had risen too much on Saturday, today's exchange rate was stable as before, and all fell back. Annam and Robbie notes were in demand, rising very slightly. Philippine and German gold notes were suddenly in high demand, and the market price was firm. Japanese gold notes were in good demand, with the market price at 9 jiao, 9 fen, and 7 li. Notes with a face value of 50 yuan, so-called large notes, were in even greater demand, with the market price at 1 yuan and 6 fen, up more than 3 fen from last Saturday. Public Association trading was not brisk. Hongchang sold Taixin British gold notes for £30, and Hengmao sold Taixin British gold notes for £40. Yesterday's market price saw British gold pounds and British gold notes each falling by 5 fen, American gold notes falling by 2 fen and 8 li, Hong Kong notes falling by 3 li, Annam and Robbie notes each rising by 1 fen, Philippine notes rising by 5 fen, and German gold notes rising by 7 fen. Other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Long Positions Already Closing Out; July Futures Foreign Exchange Eases <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listings remain unchanged. The off-market British and American exchange rates were also very stable. Although there were still many settlements from foreign firms and the Japanese bank also started to absorb shillings, HSBC and other foreign banks were still willing to supply continuously, so there was no change as a result. However, because many long positions in July futures were closing out after HSBC restricted swap transactions, although other foreign banks still traded, they mostly posted out, so they were only closing out. Speculators and Chinese banks were no longer enthusiastically arbitraging, and foreign banks' appetite was also sluggish due to the imminent delivery, so the potential market situation showed weakness again. The August market situation was very flat. As a result, the British slightly lengthened and the Americans remained flat. However, today it was heard that American banks such as Chase National had posted American dollars 375 to Chinese merchants for July-August swaps, and the combined monthly interest rate was still about 3 fen. If speculators were willing to post out, they would not do so without a monthly interest rate of 3 fen, 8 li, or 9 li. It was still difficult to swap large amounts, and generally, operators were watching for interest rates to continue to rise. Trading was brisk in the morning, but suddenly cleared up in the afternoon. Because foreign firms were strongly absorbing, the Hong Kong exchange rate softened slightly.</p>
<p>The Japanese Bank is Still Closing Out</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the recent London big bill shortened by half a penny, the long-term fell by 375, the New York silver price remained unchanged, and the London raw gold also had no ups and downs. The exchange rate of the British against the American was slightly 3 hao, and against Shanghai and France it was flat. The American against the British, Shanghai, and France also had no change. The Central listing exchange rates were as before. The bank's morning opening spot selling price saw British gold at 6 pence, 5,625, and American exchange at 12 yuan, 7,8125, both of which had no change from last weekend. After the opening, although there were still many settlements from foreign firms and the Japanese bank also started to absorb large amounts of shillings, the supply from HSBC and other foreign banks was still strong, so there was no change. It was calculated that the Japanese Bank, Zhengjin, Sanling, and foreign firms successively bought spot British gold from HSBC and Bank of China at 6 pence, 5,625. Then the foreign firm settled and bought spot American exchange from American banks at 12 yuan, 7,8125. When HSBC's listing was announced, there were no changes. When the silver balance tax was announced, it was still exempt. After that, the Chinese bank came to close out July's American exchange, but because the foreign banks' appetite was sluggish, the market situation gradually eased. It was calculated that the Chinese bank sold this month's American exchange from 12 yuan, 5625, to the Hua Bilu Holland Bank, which gradually hardened to 625. At times, there was some swap trading, with the American Bank Chase National selling out July and swapping into August, calculating a posting of American dollars 375 to Chinese merchants for arbitrage, combining for a monthly interest rate that was still about 3 fen. Near noon, a certain bank and fellow firms mutually traded August's American exchange, for 12 yuan, 1875, the situation also slightly hardened. Later, a foreign firm started to absorb spot Hong Kong exchange at a price of only 44 yuan, 25, the situation was slightly soft. Until the noon closing, the bank's spot selling price of British and American exchange was about the same as the morning opening.</p>
<p>Spot Market Situation Unchanged</p>
<p>Later market trading was sluggish. It was only heard that Bank of China absorbed July's American exchange from Bombay Silver Company at 12 yuan, 625, and the market situation was also flat. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, the foreign firms' selling price was still 44 yuan, 25, but there were no transactions heard. Extending to the evening closing, the bank's spot selling price saw British gold at 6 pence, 5,625, American exchange at 12 yuan, 7,8125, July's British gold at 6 pence, 46,875, American exchange at 12 yuan, 59,375, August's British gold at 6 pence, 21,875, and American exchange at 12 yuan, 125. As a result, the spot prices of British and American exchange were all unchanged. July's British lengthened by 0625, American hardened by 09375, August's British loosened by 03125, and the American had no ups and downs. The Hong Kong exchange rate was tight at 125 when checked against the final selling price.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Fractional Currency Substitutes <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Since the disappearance of copper subsidiary coins in this city, all industries have felt quite inconvenienced with respect to small change. Those who toil the hardest are the worst off. This newspaper gave a detailed editorial account of this matter some days ago. It is hoped that the Central Bank, which is responsible for regulating finance, will expedite the printing and transportation to Shanghai of the new one-cent and five-cent subsidiary currency notes being printed in Hong Kong, so that they can be circulated in the market as soon as possible to facilitate the turnover of various industries. During the severe shortage of copper coin subsidiary currency in this city, in addition to using stamps and stamp tax tickets as substitutes, some companies and businesses used white paper to write fractions and stamped a seal on them as vouchers. Some, such as the trolley companies of the two concessions, Sincere Company, and The Sun Company, printed vouchers as small change. The Shanghai Municipal Council Public Omnibus Company originally had five-cent (now used as four cents, white) and two-and-a-half-cent (yellow, now used as two cents) vouchers, and recently also made a type of coin with the shape of a public omnibus on it, also for two cents. However, all of these can only be used in their own industries and cannot be circulated. Now, a printing plate is made above, which can also be used as historical data on currency in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Bank Reserve Committee Revises Interbank Loan Rate <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association Reserve Committee revised the interbank loan rate, which has been implemented since yesterday (the 10th). The interest rate for borrowing interbank remittances is 2 jiao and 3 fen, and the interest rate for depositing interbank remittances is 1 jiao and 8 fen.</p>
<p>(Calculated per thousand yuan per day)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Discount Rate Increases by Another Three Yuan <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for remittance bills suddenly rose again, from 90 yuan to 93 yuan per thousand yuan in the morning, and remained unchanged in the afternoon, three yuan higher than Saturday. The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was seen to fall back by two cents, with both the morning and afternoon markets listing 1 jiao and 8 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Securities: No Definite News on Principal and Interest; Public Bonds Fluctuate <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The securities gray market situation yesterday gradually saw virtual softness. Many long positions in No. 20 and Xingyuan slightly emerged, and even retail investors and Lianhe, etc., also turned long to short, which shows that people's hearts have not calmed down after the shock of the upper decision. At present, the important key is whether the seventh decision on principal and interest has been settled. Market rumors abound, with each person having a different opinion. Market rumors can be divided into two types: either that the principal will be stopped and the interest will be paid, but the interest must also be used as collateral; or that the principal and interest will be used as collateral, but only for the banking sector. It is simple and unclear, and there is no reality to delve into the bottom. Therefore, people's hearts are not as strong as they were a few days ago. The long positions are optimistic about Class C, but only seeing 50 yuan, and temporarily seeing 48 yuan for the small face. The short positions are worried about holding goods. Compared to the news in peoples' hearts, the bond market is not easy to see as good. Yesterday, Class A broke through the 60 yuan mark. Class B secretly broke through the 50 yuan mark again after the market closed. It may not be easy to establish this trend for a while. Yesterday, at the opening, No. 4 and Dafengtongkang, etc., were sold in, while the sellers were Tongshun, Xingyuan, Lianhe, plus No. 20 and No. 49 covering the selling momentum. The multiple forces were limited, and the market price gradually decreased. Class A first broke through 60 yuan, and Class B could not stand firm, and successively broke into the 50 yuan mark after the market closed. As a result, they all turned back a small three-corner half to nine-corner, secretly small. At about one o'clock in the afternoon, Class C had approached 48 yuan. The total number of transactions was counted as 600,000 yuan. The list is shown below.</p>
<p>Stock Market Situation: The share price of the Family Industrial Co., Ltd. was 40 yuan, and 30 shares were transacted. In the public stock exchange of the public enterprises, after the sparse delivery was completed, the afternoon market atmosphere turned better, and there was a slight demand for various stocks. The Jardine share was calm and stable, at 18 yuan, 8 jiao, totaling 2,000 shares. The Telephone share rose to 12 yuan, with 700 shares transacted. The Wheelock share rose sharply to 35 yuan. The Rubber share has been sluggish for several days, and is now slightly firm. The Anderson, Meyer &amp; Co., Ltd share traded at 18 yuan, 3 jiao, and the Taikoo Dockyard &amp; Engineering Company of Hong Kong share price was 2 yuan, 7 fen, and 5 li (ex-dividend).</p>
<h3 id="e55">Cotton Yarn: Speculators and Actual Sales Rise Together, Cotton Yarn Soars <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market has shifted towards soaring prices. This is largely because the Hong Kong contingent continues to relentlessly demand both coarse and fine yarns. Simultaneously, gold has risen slightly, and public sentiment has returned to expect further increases. Consequently, transactions among fellow merchants have become active again. It is reported that the recent market turnover has exceeded the actual volume of business by more than 50%. According to market sources, the general consensus among wealthy individuals is that their faith in legal tender has diminished, and they consider hoarding goods to be a more secure option. Therefore, the once-stagnant transactions among fellow merchants have seen a resurgence in the past two days. However, the poor performance and downward trend of other yarns will inevitably create opportunities for artificial fibers. Furthermore, gold prices remain in a state of fluctuation.</p>
<p>Regarding the current yarn situation, at the beginning of the morning session, some gold-backed speculators took a bullish stance, claiming that gold prices had rebounded after being absorbed by Tianjin speculators over the weekend and that prices were about to rise. However, the opening was still flat, with a price of 477 yuan per bale for 20-count Double Horse brand yarn from the warehouse. Ten bales were traded among fellow merchants, with the current selling price being 482 yuan. Soon after, a major player rallied and started buying in the market, pushing up the market price. At the same time, the Guangzhou brokers saw a slight increase in actual sales. By the closing price, 20-count Double Horse brand yarn from outside the warehouse was priced at 487.5 yuan, while warehouse-based yarn was priced at 482 yuan. According to the half-day turnover statistics, 1,390 bales were traded, with transactions among fellow merchants accounting for 700 bales. Prices for 10-count Double Horse brand yarn rose by 7 yuan, Shepherd brand by 9 yuan, and other yarns remained unchanged, with little difference from the previous day. Yesterday, 100 bales of cotton yarn arrived from Tianjin, while today, 55 bales were shipped to Siam, 377 bales to Hong Kong, and 180 bales to Tianjin. The quantities purchased by various trade groups are listed below:</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market initially rose but then weakened, ultimately falling by 2 yuan. The reasons for this were: firstly, a shortage of legal tender and tight credit conditions; and secondly, sluggish sales and poor market conditions. The current asking price for 20-count Moon Lute brand yarn is between 386 and 387 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Banks Refuse to Provide Loans, Cotton Trading Fails to Develop <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Regarding foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market was initially firm, with reports from Liverpool and Mumbai indicating rising prices. At the same time, fellow merchants also engaged in some trading in the market, so prices were able to maintain their original levels. Subsequently, news from Washington indicated that Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace would convene a meeting with domestic cotton industry leaders this week to discuss the export subsidy plan proposed by the government. Fellow merchants were deeply concerned that there might be complications with the government's export subsidy plan, which led to long positions taking profits, and the market price saw a slight decline of 7 or 8 points. Indian cotton, along with predictions, fell by one rupee. The Egyptian market was closed.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading has seen little progress in recent days due to a lack of financial progress, and the scope of circulation has become increasingly narrow. Banks continue to refuse to provide loans for cotton, and fellow merchants are also continuing to delay payments to foreign firms under various pretexts. However, it is rumored that there will be a solution to the financial situation after mid-month, so all parties are waiting patiently.</p>
<p>The trading of Chinese and foreign cotton has gradually become more active, and factories are taking steps to purchase. However, large-scale business still lacks the possibility of development, largely due to the extreme shortage of legal tender, which prevents activity. New Yu Factory imported 800 bales of 10-count raw Indian cotton, calculated by remittance. 600 bales of cotton sent from Tianjin by the post office were purchased at a price of 106 yuan, with 20% in cash and 80% by remittance. Judging from the overall situation of the cotton market, it remains in a state of neither life nor death. The source of supply from Subei is relatively smooth, with 736 bales of Tonghua cotton arriving at the dock. The current cotton situation is listed on the left.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Piece Goods: White Goods Continue to Decline, Domestic Cloth <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the selling prices of white goods and summer bleaching and dyeing cloths in the market continued to decline, with each piece falling by 5 cents to 2 dimes. Due to abundant inventory, the prices of colored cloth and printed cloth are also unstable, and there are many differences in quoted prices. Actual sales were most active in the areas of Mazhang and Leizhou in Guangdong Province, with more than 5,000 pieces of colored materials, colored cloth, printed cloth, thread tweed, tribute drill, and other goods being traded. The Yunnan contingent hoped that the daily postal parcels would be restored, so there was some activity in various goods, with more than 3,000 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, printed cloth, crepe cloth, and bedsheets being traded. The areas of Funing and Xinghua in northern Jiangsu purchased more than 2,000 pieces of poplin, satin drill, and other goods. The Xu'zhou and Bengbu areas along the Jinpu Railway still have a healthy demand, with more than 2,000 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, and printed satin being traded. Large quantities of plain fine cloth and printed cloth were sold to the eastern provinces. The retail business in the local street was slightly better, with white goods, coarse cloth, and seasonal poplin and printed cloth being continuously replenished. Due to the tightness of credit, most people have no intention of renewing their orders for autumn goods. Dyeing factories purchased more than 100 bales of fine materials because customers had a way to sell colored twill.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>Fine cloth and fine twill are still falling due to weak actual sales. Yesterday, the lowest spot price for Longtou fine cloth in the morning market was only 13.45 yuan, a further decrease of 1.5 dimes per piece compared to the weekend. Later, the Dongmian Foreign Company offered more than 100 bales of August Longtou fine cloth futures at a price of 14 yuan per piece, and the spot market price slightly stabilized, returning to 13.5 yuan. Because the weather has been hot recently, the market only does business for half a day, so the number of transactions for the whole day is even more sparse. Local merchants and dyeing factories purchased about 500 pieces of fine twill.</p>
<p>Export</p>
<p>Today, 25 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, another 50 pieces to Siam, and another 65 pieces to Yantai, subject to environmental control.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Food: Flour Subject to Environmental Control, Stalemate as Before, New Wheat Market Gradually Weakens, Another Ship of Foreign Wheat is About to Arrive <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The current flour market situation remains sluggish. The volume of purchases by customer groups is stagnant due to cash and exchange rate issues. The northern market has not resolved the Tianjin concession issue, and there are reports that foreign flour is also being supplied there. In the southern market, it is reported that the war has resumed in the Minhai Estuary, and sales in Fuzhou and Shantou are even less likely to develop. Therefore, the sales channels for flour from large suppliers are controlled by the environment, forming a stalemate. Currently, factory flour relies only on scattered purchases from the local street, so the market is bleak and lifeless. Although the spot price of No. 2 flour is still conservatively maintained at 4.65 yuan in cash, the returned goods have already been sold at a price of 5 yuan by remittance, so it is no wonder that customers are not interested. The total number of transactions in Mujie and inland areas is estimated to be more than 10,000 bags, and the market is depressed and may be difficult to open up for a while.</p>
<p>On the 11th, 2,000 bags of flour were shipped to Weihaiwei and 5,000 bags to Tianjin.</p>
<p>The new wheat market situation has shown signs of weakness. The main source of supply is still the Huning Railway area, and the arrival of goods is not overwhelming. However, sales have been sluggish recently, and rice prices have also started to fall. Therefore, local hoarders have rarely shown interest, and purchases by Chinese factories remain stagnant, only supplying to Japanese factories. It is also reported that the supply from the Jinpu Railway can be accessed, and the market is gradually weakening. Yesterday, the market sold a total of more than 1,500 bags of wheat from Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Danyang, and Lingkou, priced at 6.9 to 6.65 yuan, all of which were purchased by Japanese factories.</p>
<p>Another ship of foreign wheat will arrive tomorrow, managed by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s "Roahlej," which is transporting 8,889 tons of wheat from Australia and is expected to arrive at the port tomorrow morning, mooring at buoys 15 and 16 for unloading and transfer.</p>

<p>Dugeng: The sources from various groups and He'xia total the fifth, the number of Chaolun Baozi Fengjing goods is nearly 2000. Since the holiday break on Sunday, the sales on the local street were even more sluggish yesterday. The mainland groups only moved a little. The sellers have been changing due to the hot weather. They all want to sell quickly, resulting in a glut of goods. The situation is sluggish, and the more it falls, the more severe it becomes. As a result, there were still few transactions. Changxi, and other geng have already fallen 2 or 3 dimes. Sutung geng sold not a single grain of rice. The arrival of Fengjing thin rice was abundant, and the rice quality was poor. The abandonment was terrible, reaching a huge 7 or 8 dimes. Other kinds of thin rice also fell 3 or 4 dimes.</p>
<p>Kexian: Most of the mainland groups suspended operations yesterday. Although there were small inquiries in the afternoon, the transaction volume was only 400 to 500 bags. The high prices of all grades decreased by 3 or 4 dimes across the board. Nanjing xian only opened at 16.5 yuan, and Gaowu xian at 16.4 yuan. The old rice in the intermediate price was even weaker. However, after the price fell, the local street took the opportunity to handle a little. The total transaction volume for the day was still 1,700 to 1,800 bags.</p>

<p>Since the industry agreed on a ten-day silver futures period, people's hearts have felt comfortable, resulting in vigorous transactions and vitality. The current situation is briefly reported as follows:</p>
<p>Soybean cake: Because the Slight Heat season has passed, the intention of rain can be reduced, which is very beneficial to agricultural affairs. Therefore, the sales of soybean cake, a fertilizer, have increased. The transactions in the market have suddenly become lively, and the market has frequently seen an increase. As a result, it increased by 8 cents compared with last Saturday, totaling 15,000 to 16,000 pieces of Dalian Yuangi and miscellaneous brands, and the price rose from 3.111 yuan to 3.116 yuan. Also, 5,000 pieces of Tianjin Laisi brand light-edged cake came at a price of 3.1135 yuan. Yesterday, 44,170 pieces of soybean cake came from Tianjin.</p>
<p>Soybean oil: The sales are quite strong in the state of silver futures. The market is also in a situation where people are determined to see the price increase, resulting in the market price rising. Yesterday, each oil in the market暴涨 8 dimes to 1 yuan compared with the previous market. A total of 150 barrels of Lian oil came from Kobe (price details in the market price column), 300 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 150 pieces of Qingqi oil, 300 pieces of Yanqi oil, 900 cans of Tianjin canned oil. Yesterday, 1,370 cans of soybean oil came from Qingdao.</p>
<p>Raw oil: The local port groups have been continuing with their stomachs, and the market atmosphere is not out of the environment of soybean oil's advance. Therefore, the market price has also risen by 5 dimes to 1.5 yuan compared with the previous one. A total of 300 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at a price of 34.5 yuan, and 100 barrels of Dalian barrel oil was sold for 46.5 yuan. Today, 700 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there were no changes in the telegraphs from Holland and Hong Kong in the sugar market, and the trend was still excellent. The association's agreed price for grade 24 coarse granulated sugar was 30 yuan for goods in local warehouses and 29.8 yuan for goods in outside warehouses, 21.65 yuan for re-export. Tai B mark was 31.4 yuan for Western warehouses, 3 dimes for Eastern warehouses, CW 31 yuan, CX 30.07 yuan, DY 30.04 yuan to 3 dimes, HX 30 yuan, H red 23 yuan, Dutch red the same price, 17 yuan for re-export.

<h3 id="e62">Government Does Not Provide Foreign Exchange for Foreign Goods Imported into Shanghai, Shanghai Is a Lost Area, Customs Did Not Follow Government's Method, Exported Native Goods Were Also Not Sold to Government for Foreign Exchange, China and Communication Banks Have Not Received Head Office Order to Handle Application for Foreign Exchange <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance announced the rules for applying to purchase foreign exchange for imported goods, it stipulates that imported goods operated by importers that are not prohibited from import and are necessary for the country may apply to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee to purchase foreign exchange. The Foreign Exchange Examination Committee is located in Chongqing, and applicants must apply to the committee in Chongqing. After approval and issuance of a notice to purchase foreign exchange, the application is designated to be handled by the China and Communication Banks. Regarding the implementation of this in Shanghai, the China and Communication Banks have not yet received orders from the head office, nor have they telegraphed the head office for instructions. The various situations are noted as follows:</p>
<p>Still Not Ordered</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance announced the application for imported goods, it stipulates that imported goods operated by importers that are not prohibited from import and are necessary for the country, after applying to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee to purchase foreign exchange, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank has been ordered to stop supplying statutory foreign exchange. Therefore, weekly applications for foreign exchange have been suspended from acceptance. However, the Shanghai Branch of the China and Communication Banks had not received orders from the head office to handle the matter of acting as an agent for applying for foreign exchange as of yesterday.</p>
<p>Shanghai Prohibits Application</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank was ordered to stop supplying statutory foreign exchange, general importers have been inquiring with the China and Communication Banks about the application process. However, the two banks replied that they could not accept because they had not received orders. Because Shanghai is a lost area, native goods exported by Shanghai Customs in the past have never been sold to the national bank for foreign exchange in accordance with the measures for settlement of export goods. Since the issuance of the ban on imports of non-essential goods, the Jianghai Customs has not implemented it. Therefore, in the future, various industries in Shanghai will not be able to apply to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee for foreign exchange for imported foreign goods, unless specially approved by the government.</p>
<p>Black Market Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Since the foreign HSBC bank in Shanghai continued to supply the needs of all parties in accordance with the principle of 6.5 pence for British exchange and 12.625 yuan for US exchange, trading has not been as prosperous as before in recent days due to currency contraction. However, speculators mostly absorbed July and sold August to implement arbitrage trading. In recent days, because the China and Communication Banks have not received orders to handle applications for foreign exchange, the foreign goods imported by various importers have still purchased foreign exchange in the black market. The supply of foreign banks is still smooth, and the exchange rate is relatively stable.</p>

<p>The English "Da Mei Evening News" said that according to Japanese sources, Kimura Kurao, Murakami Katsunosuke, Nakamura Hiromi, and Koike Katsunosuke, the manager and employees of the Shanghai Inland Navigation Company's Hangzhou Branch, set off from Hangzhou at 7:00 AM on July 5 to investigate the route to Shanghai and Suzhou via Jiaxing. At 2:00 PM, when the ship arrived at Tangqi Town, 20 kilometers north of Hangzhou, it was suddenly attacked by 60 Chinese guerrillas armed with rifles and grenades. The Japanese also fired back. Three Japanese people suffered serious injuries to their heads and abdomens. The Japanese garrison at Gongchen Bridge, south of Tangqi Town, rushed to the scene after hearing the gunshots, but it was too late. They carried the four Japanese to the Japanese military hospital in Hangzhou for treatment. On Saturday and Sunday, they were transferred to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai for treatment. The attacked Japanese people have differing opinions on whether these Chinese were local guerrillas or soldiers of the 73rd Division of the Chinese Army.</p>

The details are noted as follows: Pei Yunqing, the chairman, reported that today is the seventh repayment of principal for the 1936 Reconstruction Public Bonds. The lottery method uses the last three digits. The following is a brief report to you on the progress of the above-mentioned public bonds.

This is the seventh repayment of principal, with five branches drawn, each branch having 34. A total of 1.7 million yuan in principal repayment, and the payments for the selected bond tickets, including principal and interest due, should be made by August 31, 1939, in accordance with the methods prescribed by the Ministry of Finance, and paid by the Central Banks and their entrusted China and Communication Banks in various places.

It is heard that a method of repayment has been set, with the Unified payment on July 31, the Reconstruction payment on August 31, and the Jin Chang payment on September 30. As for the method, it will be announced by the Ministry of Finance. According to Lin Kanghou, the government's policy of maintaining credit is consistent throughout. The Unified, Reconstruction, and Jin Chang debts, which are about to expire and pay principal and interest, have been settled, and there is no problem.</p>
<p>Lottery Draws As Usual</p>
<p>The National Debt Fund Management Committee has stipulated that the eighth principal repayment lottery of the 1936 Unified Public Bonds (Type A) will be held on August 10. The twelfth principal repayment lottery of the 1928 Financial Long-Term Public Bonds, the eighth principal repayment lottery of the 1936 Unified Public Bonds (Type B), and the lottery for the 1935 Electric Government Public Bonds, the 1936 Consolidation of Guangdong Financial Public Bonds, and the 1937 Guangdong Harbor River Engineering US Dollar Public Bonds will all be held on September 10 for principal repayment.</p>
<p>Securities Dark Market</p>
<p>The Shanghai securities dark market previously experienced a sharp decline in the Unified Bonds due to rumors of suspended principal and interest payments. However, they rebounded sharply due to the government's established method for repaying various debts guaranteed by customs duties. Yesterday's closing prices were 59.9 yuan for the Unified Bonds (Type A), 50.35 yuan for Type B, 48.85 yuan for Type C, 48.35 yuan for Type D, and 48.7 yuan for Type E, slightly lower than last Saturday due to rumors in the market of payments in Chongqing.</p>

<p>British shipping in China has always held the top position. Since being affected by the Japanese blockade of the ports, it has been in extreme decline. In order to maintain their shipping industry in China, British companies such as Taikoo and Jardine Matheson are opposing any obstacles and have asked the British Navy to send warships to escort them. Now, because the coasts of North China have been monopolized by Japanese ships, they plan to develop in South China and have decided to change the Shantou-Siam line to the Shanghai-Siam line. They have designated Taikoo's Suzhou ship, with a gross tonnage of 2,646 tons and a net tonnage of 1,676 tons, to load goods and passengers from Shanghai at 10:00 AM this morning and sail to Shantou, Hong Kong, Saigon, and then to Bangkok, Siam.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Shanghai Ships Sailing to Ningbo Approved One After Another, Impact of Suspension Reduced, Still Stopping Outside Zhenhai Port for Transfer by Small Ships, De Ping Approved to Set Sail Directly to Zhenhai This Morning <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Ningbo Zhenhai Port is prohibited from navigation due to defense reasons, and the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route is interrupted. The shipping industry in this port has submitted an application to the Zhejiang Provincial authorities in order to maintain shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang, allowing ships to anchor outside Zhenhai Port. After the successful resumption of navigation by the Mufuku Ship, the shipping route between Shanghai and Ningbo has been approved by the authorities. The ships that have been approved include the Mufuku of the German Lishi Yangxing, the De Ping of the Italian Zhongyi Company, the Hana of the Far East Company is applying, and the British Taikoo Company's Xin Beijing also intends to join. Once approved, it can set sail. However, because of the blockade of Zhenhai, all ships will be diverted to Qiliyu outside the port of Zhenhai, and goods and passengers will be transferred to the Ningbo Pier through the blockade line by small steamboats and civilian ships. It is also stipulated that the transfer time will be from 6:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning, so the departure time of each ship from Shanghai is set at 4:00 AM, so that it can arrive at Qiliyu at 5:00 PM, and unload and transfer the goods that night.</p>
<p>Mufuku Arrives De Ping Sets Sail</p>
<p>The resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo is going smoothly with the German Mufuku ship. The ship continued to sail on the morning of the 8th and has arrived safely. The ship is currently transferring passengers and goods in Zhenhai Port and will return to Shanghai in the next few days. The De Ping ship of the Italian Zhongyi Company is scheduled to set sail for Ningbo this morning, and the German Hana ship is scheduled to depart on the 13th. The Xin Beijing ship will be scheduled after returning to Shanghai from Quanzhou. However, the round-trip flights are slower due to the troublesome transfer procedures.</p>
<p>Passengers and Cargo Must Be Guaranteed</p>
<p>After the resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo, the Ningbo garrison has not relaxed its defense and has imposed strict restrictions on incoming and outgoing passengers and goods. Incoming passengers must have a considerable guarantee, and outgoing passengers are limited to the elderly, weak, women, and children. However, in order to facilitate merchants to come and go to collect accounts, all legitimate merchants holding certificates from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and seeking local shop guarantees are allowed to export. Imported goods are limited to food, kerosene, raw materials, and medicines.</p>
<p>Xin Anli Ship Still Intends to Sail to Dinghai</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army landed in Dinghai, the Shanghai-Dinghai route has been affected and suspended. Recently, the Swedish Ruifeng Yangxing rented the Xin Anli ship and resumed sailing from Shanghai to Dinghai and also to Wanshan and Daishan on the 6th. It was blocked and returned, and the resumption of navigation failed. It is now known that the company is currently trying to dredge, and it is difficult to predict whether it can resume navigation. However, the situation in Dinghai has not recovered, and even if navigation resumes, the transportation of passengers and goods will be very quiet.</p>
<p>Transportation Difficulties Between Shanghai and Zhejiang Resolved</p>
<p>The original Shanghai-Zhejiang shipping routes included the Shanghai-Ningbo, Shanghai-Wenzhou, Shanghai-Taizhou, and Shanghai-Dinghai routes. Each port was successively blocked due to defense reasons. After the Shanghai-Zhejiang shipping was completely cut off, the Shanghai-Ningbo route has now implemented indirect resumption of navigation. Therefore, the difficulties encountered in the Shanghai-Zhejiang suspension of navigation can be slightly resolved. As for the Wenzhou Haimen route, there is temporarily no hope of resumption of navigation. However, the shipping industry is preparing to restore the Min Province Shacheng route, and one can detour from Shanghai to Wenzhou.</p>

After raising the flag on a large model of a cruiser built in a corner of the Legation Square, Muroci of the Legation and others delivered speeches one after another, emphasizing the importance of the ocean to Poland. Then, in the garden, Polish overseas Chinese children held shooting competitions and other games. The Polish envoy, Wei Dentao, was ill, so the festival was hosted by the Polish Consul General, Bao Homo Leike, and the head of the Polish Overseas Chinese Federation, Tomasuski.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Zhangjiagang flight is a key route for the concentrated transfer of inland passengers and goods to Shanghai.

The Japanese army responded in a panic and was immediately captured by the guerrillas. At present, the flight has not been restored.</p>

<p>The Continental Press reports that the local American official circles have received reliable news from Washington that a proposal to award Admiral Yarnell, Commander-in-Chief of the United States Asiatic Fleet, with a special medal in recognition of his work in the Far East over the past three years has been submitted to the United States Congress. The sponsors of this proposal are Senators Gillette and Harrington from Iowa, Admiral Yarnell's former district. Admiral Yarnell is originally from Independence City, Iowa. The news received here regarding this case is not detailed, but it is said that Congress is expected to take action on this case before the end of the current session. It is generally believed that a majority of both houses of Congress will vote in favor of awarding the medal. Another recent news from Washington states that when the United States High Commissioner to the Philippines, McNutt, recently met with President Roosevelt, he highly praised Admiral Yarnell's work in the Far East since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. If Congress passes the medal award proposal, then President Roosevelt will award this special medal to Admiral Yarnell in Washington after he returns to the country next month. Admiral Yarnell is currently on his flagship, the Augusta, in the North China Sea. He recently took a short trip to Beiping and is expected to return to Shanghai next week, where he will meet with Admiral Hepburn, who is scheduled to take over as Commander of the Asiatic Fleet this month.

<p>Since the tightening of foreign exchange, the price of imported paper has soared, with white paper costing about eight yuan per ream. Due to transportation disruptions, paper prices have risen even higher in inland provinces. All newspapers and publications in Zhejiang Province have been using domestic paper since the first of this month. According to people from Zhejiang Province, the Zhejiang Provincial Wartime Education and Culture Affairs Committee, in view of the fact that since the war of resistance, the development of newspapers has been like bamboo shoots after the rain, and that most of the paper used is not domestic, convened a symposium of chief editors of publications in the province and a symposium of chief editors of publications in the Jinhua area to discuss the use of local paper in various newspapers and periodicals. All agreed that it is better to promote domestic goods, benefit the people's livelihood, and stop the leak. The committee had test-printed several issues of the "Common People" semi-monthly publication using light-colored local paper, and the results were quite satisfactory. The price was far cheaper than foreign paper, so it initiated a local paper movement to promote attention to the issue of local paper in various places. The committee then completed a survey of the production volume and paper prices of local paper in Zhejiang Province, as well as the demand of various magazines. The Southeast Daily Zhengbao and Juesheng Printing House, etc., have now adopted local paper since July 1st. Other bookstores, magazine publishers, etc., in various places have also responded enthusiastically, either by switching to local paper or by purchasing from wallpaper factories.</p>

<p>The Japanese army's general offensive on Pudong, which first occupied the county town of Nanhui, has been going on for many days. There have been no troops or police in the town for two months, and there is no so-called "maintenance society." All the guerrilla forces are gathered near the Big Regiment. Because of the continuous bombing of the Big Regiment by Japanese planes in recent days, the guerrilla forces were forced to withdraw from the town and remain stationed in the suburbs. It is said that the Japanese army does not intend to occupy the town for a long time after entering the town and has the intention of withdrawing, but the future situation of the area is still unpredictable.</p>

<p>The Continental Press reports that Reuter from the Sudetenland region of Eger, Germany, is scheduled to pass through Shanghai next week on the Gneisenau en route to Japan. It is widely believed that Reuter is a special messenger carrying a private letter from the Chancellor of the Third Reich, Hitler, to Tokyo. Although the rumor that Reuter is Hitler's personal messenger could not be confirmed in Shanghai last night (the 9th), the local German newspaper Oastasiatiseher LIlyd acknowledged yesterday morning that a person from Eger is expected to arrive soon. According to the German daily, Reuter is a special staff member of the German leader, and this trip to Japan will last nine weeks. However, the newspaper gives the impression that the 28-year-old Reuter is on a pleasure trip. It also states that Reuter made special contributions to the German leader during the Sudetenland crisis last September, and that Reuter, as a member of the Sudeten German Social Democratic Party, gained considerable fame when Germany invaded Bohemia and Moravia. The German daily also stated that before the Sudetenland crisis last September, Reuter was an employee of the Victoria Hotel in Eger. He met Hitler while working at the hotel, and this publicly funded trip is a reward for his service to the National Socialist Party. The local NSDAP (National Socialist Organization) and the German community will hold a formal celebration, the details of which will be announced later this week, to welcome this 28-year-old youth. It is expected that Reuter will stay here for several days. Although the local German newspaper claims that Reuter is on a pleasure trip, it was learned from reliable sources in Shanghai last night that Reuter's trip to Japan has some political significance and that he is carrying an important private letter from Hitler to Tokyo.</p>

All procedures have been completed, and the Haina has been assigned to sail to Haiphong and Hong Kong this Thursday (the 13th).

In order to develop southwest transportation, the company plans to offer through transport services to Haiphong, Kunming, Chongqing, and other places. Mr. Chen Youou is scheduled to visit next week to conduct inspections and organize branch offices in Haiphong and Kunming.

<h3 id="e83">Five Chinese-Owned Factories' Products Designated for Prohibition by the Ministry of Economic Affairs: Each Factory Has Been Occupied and Started Operations by the Japanese; Products Should Immediately be Regarded as Japanese Goods <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Da Guang News Agency reports that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently ascertained that five Chinese-owned factories in the city, including the Minsheng Weaving Factory, have been occupied by the Japanese. The products of these factories should be prohibited in accordance with the regulations on the prohibition of enemy goods. Yesterday, a special telegram was sent to inform the various domestic goods organizations in the city. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs telegraphed that, "According to the regulations on the prohibition of enemy goods, Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 3, enemy goods shall be designated for prohibition by the Ministry at any time in accordance with Paragraph 2 of the same article. Regarding the goods to be prohibited, the Ministry has designated and announced the prohibition and ordered compliance. It has now been ascertained that five Chinese-owned factories set up in various places in Shanghai, including the Minsheng Weaving Factory, have been seized, controlled, or utilized by the enemy. The products of these factories should be designated for prohibition in accordance with the regulations on the prohibition of enemy goods. Therefore, the Ministry has listed the names, locations, products, and trademarks of the manufacturers to be prohibited and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval and record. In addition to issuing a ministerial order designating and announcing the prohibition and distributing it separately, it is hereby issued a copy of the list of enemy goods under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 3 of the regulations on the prohibition of enemy goods for your information and distribution to the various trade associations."</p>
<p>Factory Names and Products</p>
<p>The factory names and products to be prohibited are as follows: (1) Minsheng Weaving Factory, Shanghai Minsheng brand, formerly Yanghe brand (fine cloth twill cloth) (cotton fine twill cloth); (2) Sanhe Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Shanghai Huxi (on Bailinan Road, Huxi, Shanghai, formerly Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant, forcibly occupied by the enemy and converted after the incident), brand name unknown, product name dye; (3) Zhongshan Steel Factory (forcibly occupied by the enemy and converted from the Tianli Dissolved Gas Plant), location Huxi, brand name unknown, products steel products; (4) Greater Japan Paint Company (reorganized from the Yangjiadu Dadexin Oil Press), location Yangjiadu, brand name unknown, product oil; (5) Pudong Enamel Factory (occupied by the Japanese Zhongshan Steel Factory, Huafeng Enamel Factory), location Pudong, brand name unknown, product enamel.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Upper Harbor of Beisha Still Not Open: British Ships, Protected by British Warships, Sail to Sanhe Harbor for Loading and Unloading <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The three ports on the Upper Harbor of Beisha Line, after being bombed and ravaged by Japanese warships and planes, have become ruins, no different from dead cities. Only because these three ports are connected to the coastal areas of the Eastern China Sea, and are accessible in all directions, do passengers and goods rely on them for transshipment to Shanghai. Since being blockaded by the Japanese army and ordered to load and unload at Qinglong Harbor, the situation is special, and the practical difficulties are numerous. Therefore, merchant ships docked at Qinglong Harbor rarely load passengers and goods. British merchant ships, protected by the British warship "Mosquito," sail upstream and dock at Sanhe Harbor for loading and unloading passengers and goods, which maintains commercial transportation. Although the British and German consulates have lodged representations with the Japanese side regarding the resumption of navigation in the Upper Harbor, the Japanese side has blamed the naval authorities and has delayed responding, without any success. Therefore, the Upper Harbor of Beisha is still unable to open for navigation.</p>

It has been decided to vigorously implement economic self-sufficiency strategies to support the long-term war of resistance.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Bank Apprentice Bewitched by Sex and Wealth: 1,000 Yuan in Legal Tender Swindled; Cornered and Arrested; Sun Huiqing Sentenced to One Year in Prison <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Wang Changchun, an apprentice at Xingtai Bank, was ordered by his master to withdraw 1,000 yuan in cash from the bank on March 30th. While passing through Nanjing Road, he was lured by the con man Sun Huiqing (age 43, from Ningbo) to Hongmiao, under the guise of teaching magic tricks under the name of a strange magic teaching society, teaching him magic transformations such as "copper coins turning into banknotes," "one yuan turning into ten yuan," and "calling out the female beauty you think of, without having to pursue her, she will come on her own." Wang was lured into obsession by money and sex and immediately handed over the 1,000 yuan in banknotes to Sun, demanding that he quickly install the magic so that he could practice the transformation. Sun, after obtaining the money, then arranged with Wang to continue teaching the secret the next morning at Hongmiao, claiming that the required incantations were not complete and it was inconvenient to teach him immediately. Wang Changchun believed him, but months passed, and there was no sign of Sun at Hongmiao. It was not until the 3rd of this month that Wang Changchun met him (at the intersection of Shandong Road and Fuzhou Road), shouted for help, grabbed him, and brought him to the Central Police Station. After investigation by detectives, it was confirmed and he was sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. The case was continued yesterday in the First Criminal Court by Judge Xiao Xieffen, who first recorded that the victim, Wang Changchun, stated that he was 19 years old and an apprentice at the bank, and that on March 30th, he met the defendant, who pulled me over and said that he would teach me how to get rich quickly and marry a beautiful wife. I was deceived by his words and handed over 1,000 yuan to him. Then, according to the defendant Sun Huiqing, the magic is fake, and anyone with a little knowledge knows it completely, but even though everyone knows it is fake, many people think of it as a kind of game. I only took four or five yuan to learn it, and I never used the words money or sex to cheat him (referring to Wang Changchun) out of 1,000 yuan. After verifying the words in court, the judge announced the conclusion of the trial and sentenced Sun Huiqing to one year in prison for using fraud to cause others to deliver property.</p>

<p>Lin Feng, a 20-year-old man from Suzhou, lived at a certain number on Avenue Joffre. He was studying at a certain middle school. Recently, the school had summer vacation, and he was studying at home. A few days ago, he received a telegram from his uncle in Tokyo, Japan, stating that he had departed from Tokyo to return to Shanghai and that the ship was scheduled to arrive at the port at around 7:00 p.m. on the 9th. After receiving the telegram, Lin Feng went to the New Customs Wharf on time, intending to take a small steamer to the ship to meet his uncle. While boarding the ship, it is not known how, Lin Feng and three unknown people all accidentally fell into the Huangpu River. Two people were rescued by the water police station's lifeboat, but Lin Feng and one other person joined the Sea God. After a moment, they disappeared without a trace. It was not until around 10:00 a.m. yesterday that the bodies of the two people floated to the surface of the Huangpu River. The police arranged to retrieve the two bodies. After family members sent people to take the bodies to the funeral home, they notified the police station, which transported the bodies to Renji Hospital for a coroner's examination.</p>

<p>Hu Mei, an old woman from Dongtai, aged 72, lived at No. 41, Jija Lane, No. 410 Jin Shenfu Road, Dapu Bridge, French Concession. Recently, because the lease period for the land on which she built her house had expired, the landlord ordered her to demolish the house and return the land. Her son, Hu Guibao, was forced to dismantle the house, sell the lumber, and return the leased land, leading to a dispute between mother and son. The cursed Hu woman then took her own life by hanging herself from the bed frame at home at 7:00 a.m. on the 8th. Afterwards, her son did not report the incident to the police but immediately placed her in a coffin that afternoon. The next day, he moved the coffin to a boat on the Suzhou Creek on Binlang Road, intending to transport it back to his hometown for burial. It was not until yesterday that the French police suddenly received a mailed letter reporting the circumstances of Hu's suicide. The police immediately sent detectives to investigate and, on the one hand, sent the coffin to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall mortuary for a coroner's examination, pending a request to the Second Special Court to send personnel to open the coffin for examination today.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Record of Qian Zhuang Elder Mr. Qin Runqing (Part 1) <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou</p>
<p>"Not seeking personal gain, not failing due to incompetence; begin with the individual, so shall the career be." These are a few thought-provoking words that were deeply imprinted in my mind after interviewing Mr. Qin Runqing. Here, I present these words first, hoping that young people will pay extra attention to them, accept the wise words of successful people, and regard them as guiding principles. Although I ran up several marble staircases in a sweat, I felt that the price was very worthwhile.</p>
<p>In a purely Chinese-style guest room where the southern breeze gently wafted, upon seeing the rosewood furniture and the water pipe on Mr. Qin's desk, I couldn't help but feel a sense of "I was born too late"; but at the same time, I also thought that such a clean, beautiful, and antique environment was particularly lovely.</p>
<p>Mr. Qin said very modestly: I entered school in Mengguan as a child. My family was poor. I left my hometown of Cixi at the age of sixteen and came to Shanghai to work. Later, although I studied hard in the ways of learning, I still often felt the importance of education. Therefore, more than ten years ago, I founded Pudi Elementary School in Cixi, hoping to give ordinary people without the means to study the opportunity to read. In recent years, I have purchased ancient and modern books and prepared to establish Moyunlou Library in Cixi. There are now over 12,000 ancient books and over 10,000 modern books, which are available for public reading. It has now been decided to donate this collection to society. From this, one can see Mr. Qin's enthusiasm for culture and education. He said: He has no special hobbies in his life. If there is a hobby to speak of, it is only seeking out books.</p>
<p>He recalled everything about coming to Shanghai to learn his trade as a child, saying that forty-eight years have passed in a flash. Although he does not comment on the rise in the cost of living and the development of the prosperous city, his tone contains infinite emotion about the current situation. Only his spirit of "dedication and enjoyment of work" shows his optimism and excitement. In his conversation, he seemed to have forgotten his gray hair and recalled the innocent childhood. He has always worked at the Xieyuan, now Fuyuan Qian Zhuang (money exchange), not only without being bored but also becoming more dedicated to the service of his profession over time. I think this is Mr. Qin's path to success, and it is also a warning to young people who are fickle nowadays.</p>
<p>He has devoted his full efforts to the reform of the qian industry throughout his life. In the eleventh and twelfth years of the Republic of China, Mr. Nie Yuntai and he served as the chairman and vice-chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. He vigorously advocated the establishment of a library and a commodity exhibition hall, which were eventually founded by them. He is the only elder in the qian industry, and he is also involved in all public welfare activities of the qian industry. Everyone knows this, so there is no need to repeat it here.</p>
<p>Since the rise of the banking industry, qian zhuang businesses seem to inevitably suffer from the limitations of business development due to the roughly same business. I hoped to raise this point and discuss it with Mr. Qin before visiting him. After meeting Mr. Qin, I felt that the organization, vault, and other facilities of Fuyuan, or even banks with less capital, did not have his scale. Therefore, qian zhuang naturally have a reason to exist. This idea grew stronger in my mind. Next, I wanted Mr. Qin to elaborate on the future of the qian zhuang. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e94">The Success of Gonadal Endocrine Therapy: Marital Happiness Can Be Guaranteed Without Worry <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Some people say: "Life is suffering! That's why babies cry when they are born from the womb!" Although this is a religious saying, there are indeed many men and women in the world who turn good things into bad things, and turn joy into unhappiness. Therefore, they blame heaven and others, and are overwhelmed by their misery! Mutual affection between men and women, and love between husband and wife, should be the happiest thing in life. However, due to the deficiency of gonadal endocrine, men often suffer from spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, neurasthenia, etc. Even with beautiful consorts in this fragrant and sensual summer, even at the height of the act, happiness is often shattered like fleeting smoke, or they are completely unable to perform. In an instant, all that remains is hatred and sorrow!</p>
<p>According to medical judgment, the deficiency of male gonads is mostly due to early self-abuse, nocturnal emissions, or licentious indulgence, which consumes too much gonadal fluid. Then, the above symptoms are difficult to avoid. In the past, when medicine was not very advanced, many doctors knew little about the crux of these symptoms, and were often helpless in treatment. However, since the gonadal endocrine study of the nineteenth century shone brightly, it has been known that gonadal endocrine has a unique function in each stage of our life. In childhood, the development of shape, appearance, and weight is almost entirely manipulated by it. After the onset of puberty, in addition to carrying out reproductive functions, its endocrine irrigates the whole body through the blood, promoting development, adjusting metabolism, and nourishing the brain, spinal cord, and various nerves in sexual areas. Therefore, it has a very important and huge impact on our development, health, life, character, love, and eugenics.</p>
<p>Recently, amazing success has been achieved in gonadal endocrine therapy. After more than thirty years of arduous experiments, an Austrian medical saint extracted gonadal hormones from robust animals such as apes, gorillas, bears, and deer, and replicated them into a drug using scientific methods, which is named "Gonadotrophin." Repeated experiments have shown that its effect is miraculous, as the saying goes, "the right medicine is like opening a lock." It has also been proven by millions of doctors around the world that this medicine can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, invigorate the blood, and nourish the nerves within 24 hours after taking it. Continuing to take it for half a month can help promote development and adjust metabolism. All the above symptoms will be completely cured. Long-term use can prolong life, and middle-aged and elderly people can achieve the effect of rejuvenating. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Hemitol's Spermatocelin" (available in Yong'an Xianshi Pharmacy and Sino-French, Sino-Western, Wuzhou and other major pharmacies) to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage, so that both the symptoms and the root cause can be treated, and the effect will be rapid!</p>
<h3 id="e95">Spermatorrhea is the Premonitory Symptom of Kidney Deficiency and Brain Weakness <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>According to the normal state of physiological development, young people should have rich minds and abundant energy. Therefore, their thinking ability, discrimination ability, and decision-making ability are constantly improving! Such young people are the treasures of society and the future masters of the nation. However, the young people of today are quite different from what we expect. Eight or nine out of ten are sallow and emaciated, slow-thinking, look sleepy when they are sitting at a desk, and appear tired when they are working! In terms of sexual function, they often have spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, neurasthenia, etc. Sexual desire is most easily impulsive. They spend all day seeking pleasure, and are seen through by modern women, resulting in endless pain from broken love! Even in married life, due to kidney deficiency and weakness, they are often resentful, and the family is plunged into a tragic situation!</p>
<p>How did these fine young people get to this point? According to medical judgment, most of them have committed self-abuse and indulgence in their early years, leading to spermatorrhea. If spermatorrhea is not treated, the gonadal endocrine fluid will be exhausted, and the above symptoms are inevitable. In addition, there are relatively few cases of congenital weakness, postpartum disorders, and excessive brain or physical exertion leading to the above symptoms. Since we understand the cause of the disease, it is easier to treat. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking "Hemitol's Spermatocelin Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage is the only effective treatment for the symptoms. At the same time, taking the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadotrophin" to nourish the brain, kidneys, essence, and blood, and to nourish the nerves and promote development, is the only effective treatment for the root cause. Treating both the symptoms and the root cause will surely restore perfect health in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Patient Tang Ronghua, from Qingpu, 26 years old, committed self-abuse during his student days, followed by spermatorrhea. Half a year later, his brain power was extremely weak, and he had insomnia and night sweats at night. He barely graduated from middle school and failed to enter university. He married a year ago, but due to premature ejaculation and impotence, sexual intercourse was difficult and boring, and his brain weakness became more severe. Therefore, he sought treatment from me. I immediately instructed him to take "Hemitol's Spermatocelin Tablets" and "Gonadotrophin," and at the same time, I performed electrotherapy injections. After a month of careful treatment, he was completely recovered. Recently, I heard that Mr. Tang is teaching in an elementary school, and his love with his wife is getting deeper and deeper, and his life is very happy.</p>

<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>"Two points of appearance, seven points of dress." I don't really agree with this sentence, and it's a bit unreasonable. Imagine: a woman with a withered face, high cheekbones, deep eye sockets, a thin body, narrow hips, a flat chest, and no prominent breasts. Even if you ask this kind of woman to wear the most expensive lace cheongsam, apply powder and rouge, and walk on the street, I know that not only will no one say she is beautiful, but they will even look at her like a living monster! On the contrary, if this woman has a beautiful face, even bones and muscles, full hips, and a pair of elastic breasts rising high in front of her chest, slightly showing a rise and fall as she moves, then even if she has messy hair and rough clothes and no makeup, she will naturally have a supreme beauty that is set off from all around her. It is not diminished because she is not dressed up. Therefore, I think "dress" is just some green leaves on the peony. The main point of beauty is in the person itself. If there are defects in the person itself, such as shriveled breasts, narrow hips, withered face, and loss of beauty, the only way to save it is to immediately use the globally renowned gonadal ovarian preparation for women, "Gonadotrophin," for nourishment. This preparation was invented by the former Austrian medical saint, Dr. Stana, after more than thirty years of arduous experiments. After taking it for one day and night, it can nourish ovarian function, promote metabolism, adjust menstruation, and eliminate uterine disorders. If you continue to take it, it will surely make the shriveled breasts gradually rise high, and the thin hips become more plump day by day. At that time, your cheeks will be delicate and your curves will be obvious. Even if you don't wear gorgeous clothes, I guarantee that when you enter and exit social occasions, you will naturally be like the moon surrounded by stars. Someone will respect you, love you, and pursue you enthusiastically. You can really look around and enjoy happiness.</p>

<h3 id="e97">New Advances in Gonorrhea Treatment <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Gonorrhea treatment has recently made new advances, and the face of the disease has been renewed. Gonorrhea is difficult to cure and its infectiousness is unusually strong and rapid. Therefore, it is extremely widespread, especially in prosperous metropolises, where its power is fierce, surpassing even the flooding of rivers. Moreover, its harm is not limited to the individual, but also infects their wives and passes it on to their children. It is truly what is called poisoning three generations. Now, due to new advances in gonorrhea treatment, this rampant gonorrhea has a tendency to be stopped. In the era before the advancement of science, it was believed that gonorrhea was a disease of the urethra. Therefore, the treatment method was nothing more than local surgery to wash the urethra. Over-the-counter proprietary medicines taken internally are only intended to promote urination, and most have side effects. Know that gonorrhea can be eradicated in the acute stage. However, if the gonorrhea toxin has invaded the interior, the physiological structure gradually becomes complex, and gonorrhea bacteria can escape everywhere, then local surgical treatment and general proprietary medicines will inevitably miss the mark and have no practical effect in killing bacteria and expelling gonorrhea. Therefore, these treatments have long become historical relics. The most advanced treatment, the Lymph-Plexus Flow Electrotherapy, the latest invention in Germany, is indeed a major advance in physical therapy and a representative of advances in gonorrhea treatment. The most advanced hospitals in European countries have this electrotherapy equipment. Other methods, such as German Hee's Serum, autogenous vaccine, and Fei's prostate massage, are all modern scientific advances that have special treatments for gonorrhea that are noble and most authoritative, truly different from ordinary city doctors and inferior drugs.

<p>Lin Shun Customs Clearance and Transportation Company, No. 13 Tianjin Road, on Saturday morning (the 8th) around 9 o'clock, hired car driver Zhou Fengchao, from Tongzhou, and laborers Sun Shoushan, Wu Jindi, Zhao Qingliang, Yin Cailiang, Shi Yongting, etc. through Jiuda Customs Brokerage on Sichuan Road, to drive a truck to Wharf No. 13 on the Bund to load ten thousand yuan worth of cotton to the Xinyu Yarn Factory on Xiaoshadu Road in western Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the factory had not received the goods by noon. They inquired with Lin Shun by telephone, and Hu Shouting of Lin Shun relayed the inquiry to Jiuda, who replied that when they started transporting in the morning, an uninvited guest of about forty years old, claiming to be a representative of Lin Shun, came with orders to change the destination of all the cotton to Great Western Road, so it was not delivered to Xinyu. Upon hearing this, Hu suspected something had happened and rushed to the area of the specified location on Great Western Road. There, he discovered that only half of the original cotton remained. According to rumors, the missing twenty-eight bales had been taken away in two trucks. Hu reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Detective Wang Wenbin and Western detective Teil were dispatched to investigate, but found no clues. Therefore, the car driver Zhou Fengchao and the five laborers Sun, Wu, Zhao, Yin, and Shi were arrested. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Dai interrogated them. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu briefly described the circumstances of the case and requested that Zhou and the others be detained for further investigation. The court questioned the six men briefly and ordered them to be detained for two weeks for investigation.</p>

<p>Fan Siyu, a Chaozhou native residing at No. 23 Yufu Lane, Iron Gate Entrance, Pierre Street, French Concession, 33 years old, had been suffering from lung disease for more than ten years. He was the son of the late Fan Jiwu, the owner of the opium paste shop, Fan Jiwu. He had nine brothers, and his elderly mother was still alive. On the afternoon of the 6th of this month, at 7 o'clock, the brothers argued over the distribution of the inheritance, causing their mother to leave in anger and not return for two days and nights. On that day, Siyu's younger brother Silou, fifth younger brother Sihong, and sixth younger brother Sizhang went to Siyu's place to ask about their mother's whereabouts, and another conflict arose. Sihong pushed Siyu violently, causing him to vomit blood instantly. He was immediately sent to Guangci Hospital, but died before treatment could be given. The body had been sent to the Shanghai Funeral Home for burial. After the French police reported the incident based on the report of the deceased's wife, Fan Guo, on Saturday at noon, they sent detectives to hoist Fan Siyu's coffin to the Forensic Examination Office of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch. All the details of the Second Special Court's autopsy have been recorded in this newspaper. After seeing the newspaper report, Fan Silou, Fan Sihong, and Fan Sizhang hired lawyer Wang Liwu to send letters to various newspapers to clarify and correct the inaccuracies, and to publish an advertisement. Yesterday morning, the French police requested Wang Ren, the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, accompanied by forensic doctor Jiang and clerk Xi, to come to the office for examination at noon. At that time, the deceased's wife, Fan Guo, and the defendants Fan Silou, Fan Sihong, Fan Sizhang, and witness Guo A'ming (the deceased's cousin, who usually served Fan Siyu), had been summoned by the police officer to order workers to pry open the coffin lid and remove the body to place it on a mortuary bench and remove the burial clothes. After the forensic doctor performed the examination according to the law, the prosecutor ascended the judgment seat and questioned the plaintiff, the deceased's wife, Guo, and the witness Fan A'ming, who both testified that they had seen the defendants Fan Silou, Fan Sihong, and Fan Sizhang come together to ask the deceased about their mother's whereabouts. The deceased replied that he did not know, and Sihong pushed the deceased, causing him to vomit blood immediately. He was sent to Guangci Hospital, but died before treatment could be given. The defendants Fan Silou, Fan Sihong, and Fan Sizhang all denied pushing the deceased and causing him to vomit blood, saying that only at 11:00 AM on that day did the three brothers ask their second brother (the deceased) about their mother's whereabouts, and they should immediately post a notice to find her. Then they dispersed and there was no dispute or pushing. After receiving the testimony, Prosecutor Wang briefly inquired with the forensic doctor and concluded that Fan Siyu died of internal injuries caused by shock. The body was handed over to Fan Guo for burial. The defendants were taken to the police station for handling. After the autopsy, the family members returned the body to be reburied. In the afternoon at 3 o'clock, the police summoned the three defendants, their elderly mother (who had returned home after seeing the report on the 9th), the plaintiff, the deceased's wife Fan Guo, and the witnesses to the case for questioning, awaiting transfer to the court for legal prosecution.</p>

<p>Yangzhou native Pan Dalong, 27 years old, and his wife Luo Pan, (20 years old), hired a lawyer to accuse Chen Guowan and his wife of obstructing their freedom. According to the complaint, they rented a shop from Zhang Yongquan, who lived in the pavilion room at No. 13 Airen Lane, Fuxu Road, for a monthly rent of five yuan in October of last year. On June 9th, Zhang was arrested for smoking opium outside and was sentenced to three months in prison by the court. Therefore, the plaintiff resided in the pavilion room. Unexpectedly, on the 22nd of the same month, at 5:00 PM, Chen, accompanied by a Westerner and a translator from the police station, came and locked the door of the room, preventing the plaintiff from living inside. Therefore, they requested the court to order the defendant to open the pavilion room and to compensate them with two yuan in legal tender to cover the cost of lodging in a hostel. The court accepted the complaint, and Judge Jiang opened a court hearing the day before yesterday. The plaintiff's testimony was as above. However, according to the defendant Chen Guowan, the tenant Zhang Jicheng was arrested for smoking opium in the kitchen shed of Pan Youcai at No. 4 of the same lane. Pan escaped and suddenly hid in the pavilion room where Zhang lived with his children, occupying it and refusing to leave. Therefore, he reported to the police station to seal it off, waiting for Zhang to complete his sentence before applying for it to be reopened. Therefore, there was no obstruction of the plaintiff's freedom. After reviewing the testimony, the court found that further investigation was needed and ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>

<p>Han Ruizhang, a Huabei police officer from Hubei Province and gatekeeper at No. 355 Lane, Maignan Road, was armed when he was on duty every day. Unexpectedly, at 6 o'clock in the evening of the day before yesterday, the police officer suddenly reported to the Gordon Road Police Station that a pistol with serial number 1317, along with five bullets, that he was carrying had mysteriously disappeared that afternoon. After receiving the report, the police chief believed that since the weapon had never been separated from him for a moment and there had been no theft, it was extremely suspicious why it had been lost, and the police officer could not explain it. Therefore, Han was immediately detained, and detective Wang Chengying and Western detective were dispatched to the alley to investigate. It was found that the alley only had one entrance and exit, and the entrance was equipped with an iron gate, making it difficult for accidents to occur. It was clear that the police officer had other secrets regarding the disappearance of the weapon. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court, and police lawyer Qian Xunjiu requested permission to detain the police officer for thorough investigation. Judge Dai briefly questioned Han and ordered him to be detained for further investigation and handling after clarification.</p>

<p>Wang Zhaobang, a surgeon from Shaoxing (37 years old), recently came to Shanghai from his hometown and set up a clinic at No. 666 North Zhejiang Road. Between the 3rd and 8th of this month, Hong Amao, a Ningbo native residing at No. 223 Gansu Road, suddenly developed a sore on his right leg that was unusually red and swollen. He and his wife Zhang hired a car to Wang's clinic twice for treatment. First, they prescribed disinfectant medicine for drinking and gave ointment for application, but both were ineffective and instead made it worse. The third time, they asked him to come home for treatment. He immediately performed surgery. The fourth time, he used a clay pot containing some kind of medicinal herbs, heated it with fire, and placed it on the leg to draw out the poison. Hong Amao felt very painful and even became comatose. Unexpectedly, he died at home at 6:00 AM on the 9th. His wife Zhang was grief-stricken and believed that Wang had used an abnormal surgical method, using a clay pot to heat the sore, which was the act of an itinerant doctor disregarding human life. Therefore, she reported the incident to the No. 1794 Huabei police, and they went to his clinic on North Zhejiang Road. They encountered each other on Gansu Road and often handed him over to the Huizhong Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Court 3 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan described the incident and requested that Dr. Wang be detained, adding that the body of the deceased Hong Amao was awaiting examination at the Forensic Examination Office. Zhang testified that her husband was killed by Wang's treatment. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to remain in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<p>Three apprentices were injured in the blast last night. At half past eight, at a sand-turning workshop at No. 25 Yixing Lane, Binlang Road, Western Shanghai, one of the apprentices suddenly picked up a grenade nearby and brought it back. The apprentice did not know what a bomb was. While he was playing with it, he accidentally dropped it on the ground. It exploded immediately with a loud bang that shook the vicinity.

<p>Wang Xiaopin (aka Wang Yongsheng) from Ningbo, formerly an employee of the Seamen's Union, who currently runs a shipping ticket agency at 6 The Bund in the French Concession and resides at 6 Lafei Lane, Lafei Road, was fatally shot at the intersection of Massenet Road on the evening of the 23rd of last month around 7 PM. A Yancheng native named Xu Ji, who fired the shots, was apprehended on the spot by the police. After interrogation, Xu confessed that Chen Yanzhou was also involved and was hiding at 330 Fulvli Road. Detectives were dispatched to the address, but Chen had already fled. Only a Jiang Jiayou, who introduced Chen when he rented the house, was apprehended and brought to the police station and sent to the Special No. 2 Court for interrogation, with the case being adjourned. Details have already been reported in previous issues. Yesterday, the case was adjourned for continued trial. The police lawyer, Yuan Jiahuan, stated that the case still needed investigation and requested an adjournment. After verifying the statements in court, the two defendants were interrogated and the court adjourned the case for another hearing. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>Li Yidong, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road Police Station, along with detectives Peng Chunxuan and Zhang Jingyu, discovered that someone was privately possessing military weapons at No. 45, Lane 929, Dongyouheng Road. They rushed to search the premises at 1 PM the day before yesterday. They arrested Wang Shichang, a 62-year-old Tongzhou native, and confiscated a large Mauser pistol and thirty-one rounds of rifle ammunition. They were brought back to the police station and sent to the Criminal Division 4 of the Special No. 1 Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, prosecuted Wang Shichang for the crime of privately possessing military weapons under Article 196 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, Wang Shichang claimed that the military weapons were deposited in his house by a fugitive named Wu Si and were not privately possessed by him. After questioning by Judge Fang Qinghuan, the court announced its verdict: Wang was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment as a warning, and the confiscated guns and ammunition were confiscated.</p>

<p>Li Xiaodi, a 20-year-old native of Pudong, residing at Room 15, House 17, Lane 118, Avenue Notre Dame, and Cao Wenyu, a 30-year-old native of Pudong currently residing at No. 11, Lane 310, Route des Soeurs, (formerly working at Huili Company at 50 Ningbo Road in the French Concession, now working at Taishan Foreign Firm,) are cousins ​​through marriage. In March of last year, Cai ordered 20,000 bags of Chuzhou wheat from Cao at a price of $7.65 per bag. Subsequently, a dispute arose because Cao could not deliver the goods. Cai is now suing Cao in the Civil Division of the Special No. 2 Court to recover a deposit of $4,200 and compensation for breach of contract of $8,000. The China Record Company recorded the phone conversations between Cai and Cao as evidence. Cao proposed a settlement, claiming that the matter had been resolved amicably by settling with rice. However, Cai alleges that Cao stole his seal and forged the settlement agreement. Now, he has also engaged lawyer Xu Jinyu to file a private prosecution against Cao Wenyu in the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court for forgery and is seeking to recover the seal in a related civil suit. After one court hearing, the defendant failed to appear and the hearing was postponed. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Pengxian opened the court to announce a renewed hearing. The defendant appeared with his defense lawyer, Huang Huijie. First, the prosecuting attorney presented the charges, then the court questioned the defendant about the settlement agreement. Cao stated that he wrote the settlement agreement and that the plaintiff affixed his seal. According to the agreement, he did not owe the plaintiff any money; the plaintiff should owe him 679 yuan. Cao claimed that he worked at Huili Company, and the company had wheat. The plaintiff was unwilling to trade with Japanese merchants, so he acted as an intermediary to order from Japanese merchants. When asked why there were no witnesses on the settlement agreement, Cao replied that it was because he was momentarily unavailable. The plaintiff stated that the wheat contract was dated March 24th of last year, was written on two pages, had witnesses, and had seals over the seams. Now, the defendant's settlement agreement has neither witnesses nor seals over the seams, clearly indicating forgery. At this point, the court ordered the record to be played on a phonograph, and the plaintiff's lawyer listened to the conversations from both sides over the phone. The court then ordered the record to be filed. The defendant's father claimed that the plaintiff recorded the conversations on the 4th, 5th, and 6th of May, when the defendant was not in Shanghai but was in Pudong on business. Both sides requested the court to appoint someone to authenticate the accents on the recording. The court then adjourned the hearing to 8 AM on the 19th and released the defendant on a 1,000 yuan bail.</p>

<p>Wu Xiquan, a lawyer residing at No. 5, Huayuan Village, Route Lugan, had a four-story apartment. On the 11th of last month, he rented a room to Zhu Jingci, a Nantong native who worked at the Dasheng Cotton Mill, for a monthly rent of 55 yuan. Zhu moved in and paid two months' rent of 110 yuan. On the 4th of this month, Wu suddenly ordered Zhu to move out by the 5th. Zhu replied that he needed to stay until the end of the month, leading to a verbal altercation. At 10 PM on the night of the 4th, Zhu returned home from outside, and Wu assaulted and injured Zhu, causing his nose to bleed and his right forehead to bruise. Zhu reported the incident to the French police, who dispatched detectives to investigate and summoned both parties to the police station for investigation. Yesterday morning, they were sent to Criminal Division 8 of the Special No. 2 Court for questioning. The defendant Wu Xiquan failed to appear. Only the plaintiff, Zhu Jingci, appeared and briefly described the assault. Judge Qiu adjourned the hearing and ordered the defendant to be summoned again on the 3rd for questioning and verification and ordered the plaintiff to verify his injuries.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Indeed, the so-called "Theory of Chinese Medical Art" (Part 1) <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Song Daren</p>
<p>A few years ago, the theory of Qi transformation in Chinese medicine and the theory of philosophy in Chinese medicine were also popular for a while; but soon they were severely refuted by the new medical community and the scientific community, their fallacies were exposed, and they disappeared without a trace. Since the war, medical forums have been silent for a long time; people in society have also been unable to pay attention to it. Recently, I saw an article entitled "Theory of Chinese Medical Art" by Mr. Zhang Feng, published in this journal, followed by Mr. Ding Jinan's speech (North China Star Daily, October 20, 1938) in response, which is like a new thorn in the medical community, especially today when the standards for establishing Chinese medicine schools are being promulgated and implemented, it is even more worthy of attention. Mr. Zhang has served as a university teacher for many years, is knowledgeable and famous, and is in a position to lead young people. His academic thoughts are sufficient to influence social opinion; Now when I look at the argument of his full text, it involves ambiguity and vagueness, and there is no clear definition, which does not seem to be the attitude that a scholar should take. I dare not be humble and point out the mistakes in the original texts of the two gentlemen, and I am willing to discuss them with my colleagues and those who care about them.</p>
<p>What is the Art of Chinese Medicine?</p>
<p>To talk about the "Art of Chinese Medicine," we must first talk about the definition of art; art has a broad sense and a narrow sense. In a broad sense: all activities and productions that contain skills and considerations—such as mechanical craftsmen building houses—are called art—that is, the meaning of technology. As for art in the narrow sense, it refers to the activities of beautiful value, or the products of its activities, the meaning is the same as Fineart. Since the definition of art has been clarified, then the establishment of the "Theory of Art" can be criticized!</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang said: "Chinese medicine is art." This question is not Mr. Ding Jinan's original solution. It was also discussed in Liang Shuming's book "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies"; now I will first transcribe Liang's views below.</p>
<p>"...Although we can also make iron, steel, gunpowder,...and all kinds of manufacturing projects rely on the "skills" passed down from the craftsmen's hearts, the West must rely on science—using a method to organize many fragmented experiences and incomplete knowledge into learning, and explore forward. Industry is like this with "skills", agriculture is also like this,...it is absolutely not done by personal wisdom,...in fact, it is still skills. Western medicine prescriptions, certain diseases, certain medicines, no big difference; and the masters of Chinese medicine, their talents and skills are all in prescribing medicines. Ten doctors have ten different prescriptions, and they can be very different. Because the diseases treated and the medicines that can be treated are not objective. What is the disease? Where is the "sick"? There is no need to test it, just observe the disease situation from an empty perspective. (There is no mention of "disease" in Chinese medical books) What is the composition of a certain medicine? What is its effect? Don't ask, just use warm and cool words to evaluate it. The opinions are very different about whether it is warm or cool. How can his diagnosis and medication not be different for ten people? This kind of spirit that requires a certain objective and universally recognized knowledge is the spirit of science. This kind of spirit that completely despises objective standards and rules and specializes in worshiping genius is the spirit of art...." ——Chapter 2, page 26 of "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies."</p>
<p>"...Science seeks universal rules and principles, which everyone recognizes and verifies; therefore, what the predecessors had, the present people have, and what is valuable is the new invention, and step by step, step by step, of course, the present is better than the ancient. Art lies in the genius and secret skills, which are uniquely obtained by individuals. Later generations often feel that they can't catch up with the achievements of the predecessors. What is valuable is the secret recipe passed down from ancestors, and naturally they sigh that the present is not as good as the ancient. Since it is passed down from the master and disciples, the result will inevitably be divided into schools, and no common standard can be established in academics. The first step is not solid, how can the second step move forward, and even the things passed down from the master and disciples sometimes will be lost, and the present is not as good as the ancient is also an inevitable fact...."</p>
<p>——Chapter 2, pages 26-27 of "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies"</p>
<p>In fact, what Mr. Liang called art is the meaning of technical skill, and does not have a very beautiful meaning and value, and does not refer to "fine art" in the narrow sense. Moreover, it is a mixed statement, and it does not specifically refer to Chinese medicine. Mr. Liang has already stated that Chinese medicine is not "learning." Now, looking at Mr. Ding Jinan's original text, it is indeed derived from Mr. Liang, but the latter part of the original text suddenly says "Chinese medicine is art," probably thinking that this would be very moving to hear. However, medicine is certainly not "fine art" but "science." Mr. Ding also knows this, but insists on saying that it is art. I really don't understand, what is glorious about saying that Chinese medicine is art—skills—? It really cannot get rid of the common problem of not being able to distinguish the different paths of "learning" and "skills"; in short, "Chinese medicine" and "Chinese medical science" are absolutely different. "Chinese medicine" is a "person," "Chinese medical science" is a paper full of absurd words, so "Chinese medical art" is not equal to "Chinese medical science art," and should never be confused. Mr. Zhang even regards it as a narrow art that is "full of fun, emotional, and attractive"—fine art—and wants to combine the two nouns of "Chinese medical science" and "art" to create something called "Theory of Chinese Medical Art," wanting to "make the absolute medical science theorists hesitate," it is not only a joke, but also a bit close to nonsense. The argument is already wrong, and naturally the deduction and citations are all wrong. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e116">A Brief Discussion of "Vitamins" in Cod Liver Oil <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Jingren</p>
<p>Cod liver oil is the fat oil from the fresh livers of fish of the Gadidae family, Gadus Murrhua Linne, and G. Macrocephalus Tilesins, POlloachius brandi, Jordan et Snylea, etc., which is obtained after removing impurities by chemical methods. It is a golden yellow, clear oil liquid. This product has always been regarded as a medicine, but in recent years, it has been regarded as a general public nutrient. The main components of this product are vitamins A and D (Vitamin A. C10H30O, Vitamin D. C28H44O). Vitamin A is the most abundant in cod liver oil, followed by vitamin D. According to the United States Pharmacopoeia (U.S.P.), each cubic centimeter of cod liver oil should contain at least 600 international units of vitamin A and at least 85 international units of vitamin D. Vitamins have great medicinal value and are described as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Vitamin A can treat keratomalacia, developmental disorders in children, malnutrition, liver disease, hypoacidity, etc., and can also be used externally to treat trauma.</p>
<p>(B) Vitamin D can treat rickets in children, chondromalacia, infantile convulsions, tetany, etc., and can also be used as an adjunct to calcium treatment.</p>
<p>From the above-mentioned functions, it can be seen that cod liver oil is indeed an indispensable substance for our daily health care, especially for children. Cod species containing cod liver oil are produced along the coasts of Europe and America, with Norway and Denmark producing the most. Our country's coastal provinces do not produce this kind of fish, so the cod liver oil used in our country's medical treatment must be imported.</p>
<p>Although cod liver oil has great benefits for us, it has a special odor that is unpalatable and easy to induce nausea. However, with the progress of modern science, pharmaceutical chemists have been able to use chemical methods to extract or concentrate vitamins A and D from cod liver oil and make them into other preparations that are delicious and easy to take, and their effectiveness is even greater than that of the original oil. Therefore, the clear cod liver oil sold on the market (Cod Liver Oil) often contains effective ingredients vitamins A and D that have been extracted. If we take this kind of cod liver oil, there is no effect at all, and it is a waste of money and a delay in health. Therefore, when cod liver oil is imported from foreign countries, the selling pharmacy should first inspect it and then sell it according to the results. Otherwise, if it is sold without inspection, it will be a loss of business ethics and credit. Hereby, the inspection methods of cod liver oil are recorded below; as for the biological potency test of vitamins in cod liver oil (Biological Potency Test), because it cannot be completed in a short period of time and cannot be carried out in a general laboratory, it is omitted and will be described in detail in another article.</p>
<p>The general simple inspection method of cod liver oil is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The specific gravity of this product at 25oC should be O, 918-O, 927.</p>
<p>(2) The acid value of this product should not exceed 2.5.</p>
<p>(3) The unsaponifiable value of this product should not exceed 1.5%.</p>
<p>(4) The saponification value of this product should be 163-190</p>
<p>(5) The iodine value of this product is 140.180</p>
<p>(6) Dissolve one drop of this product in twenty drops of chloroform, then add one drop of sulfuric acid, shake, and it will turn reddish-purple, quickly turn rose-red, and finally become brownish-yellow.</p>
<p>(7) Place ten to fifteen drops of this product on a watch glass, then add two or three drops of fuming sulphuric acid. After placing it, it will turn red. After stirring with a glass rod, it will turn rose-red and finally become lemon yellow (if it is another type of oil, there will be no such pigment change, or it will first become yellow or blue, etc.).</p>
<p>(8) In 1925, Rosenhein and Drummond discovered the pigment reaction for testing vitamin A. After adding Arsenic Trichloride test Solution to cod liver oil, it turned a bright blue. However, after further research by Carr and Price, they believed that using Antimony Trichloride dissolved in chloroform as a test solution, the reaction produced was even more sensitive than using arsenic trichloride solution.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Observations on the Treatment of Pneumonia (Continued from Issue 23) <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>

<p>After Serum Therapy</p>
<p>Mortality Rate Reduced by Fifty Percent</p>
<p>The original concept of Antipneumonia Serum originated in 1897, but it was not fully effective until 1909. Later, Neufeld and Handel cooperated to create a polyvalent serum, achieving satisfactory results. This led to the recognition that a type of diplococcus is the main cause of pneumonia, harboring malice, accumulating viruses, and lurking within diverse serotypes (like clusters of Lupine flowers in a garden).</p>
<p>Antitoxic serum, made from a mixture of various serotypes, is called "polyvalent serum." However, before the discovery of polyvalent serum in 1924, Felton created a highly concentrated serum. Unfortunately, due to improper use, it repeatedly failed, and its reputation did not spread.</p>
<p>However, the efficacy of antitoxic serum only extends to the same serotype of pneumococcus, so it has little effect on other serotypes. For example, for the most common Type 1 and Type 2, if Type 2 serum is used for Type 1 infections, it will be completely ineffective. If polyvalent serum is used indiscriminately, regardless of serotype, its efficacy will only reach a part of the infection, ultimately failing to achieve widespread effectiveness, leading to poor results.</p>
<p>Because of this characteristic, antitoxic serum is only suitable for confirmed serotypes of pneumococcus, enabling the control of infection and reliable efficacy. Therefore, it is imperative to use the correct serum to be legitimate. At the same time, upon the initial admission of patients to the hospital, it is essential to examine the bacteria in their sputum.</p>
<p>The earlier serum is used, the better; otherwise, later diagnoses may result in missed treatment opportunities. To avoid delays, if the serotype of the bacteria is not examined and polyvalent preparations are injected rashly, hoping for rapid results, even with large amounts of serum, the achieved efficacy will be very thin, and the outcome will inevitably be failure. Unless the key points of the specific serotype are discovered, it will be difficult to recover the lost value of serum therapy.</p>
<p>Most pneumonias involve Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 serotypes, and each serotype serum can be quickly effective for its respective Type. However, in reality, it is not so simple, because there are as many as thirty Types of pneumococcus, and specific serotype serums are now available for each serotype. However, the differentiation of serotypes has become a matter of consideration. Fortunately, 60 percent are Type 1, Type 2, or their mixed serotypes. But in the event of other Types, accurate identification must be made to complete serum therapy.</p>
<p>Since Neufeld and Sabin created a rapid and simple serotyping method, significant progress has been made. This serotyping test allows even less experienced testers to determine the serotype of pneumonia within minutes. Therefore, early diagnosis is completed reliably, and rapid specific efficacy is self-evident. Thus, the opportunity for successful treatment is greatly increased, making it the most significant advance in medicine.</p>
<p>Pneumonia's diplococcus is usually hidden within a dense capsule, making it difficult to detect even with a microscope. Adding a specific serotype of antitoxic serum to a drop of sputum containing pneumococcus causes a typical change within this capsule, causing the bacteria to swell and develop, creating a diffractive phenomenon resembling frosted glass.</p>
<p>This Quelluug phenomenon is medically significant, and its test is very precise, so the results obtained are foolproof. Therefore, the efficacy of specific serum therapy is based on the Type of this bacterium, resulting in excellent outcomes. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e118">American Consul Arrests Li Zhenda <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>When the Easterners (Japanese) mobilized troops to conquer the Taiwanese aborigines, the envoys of various Western countries stationed in the East, knowing that China had not given permission, which violated international law, all issued notices to merchants, forbidding them from renting ships to the Easterners or serving in their military. Although the order was issued, the American people were still unable to comply. Therefore, an American named Li Zhenda, employed by the Easterners, was arrested by the American consul when passing through Xiamen and immediately detained. Li Zhenda was originally a general in the United States and later served as a consul in Xiamen. During his leisure time, he traveled extensively to various islands in Taiwan, so he had a thorough understanding of the island's terrain. After retiring and returning to his country, he passed through the East. At that time, the Eastern court was discussing the massacre of Ryukyu refugees by Taiwanese aborigines. Hearing that Li Zhenda knew the details of the island, they immediately consulted him. Li Zhenda presented the map he had drawn and detailed the advantages and disadvantages of Taiwan. Therefore, the Eastern court appointed him as a consulting minister. In the campaign in Taiwan, many matters were directed by him. The day after his arrest, the American consul held a court hearing and asked Li Zhenda: "You have incited the Easterners to break peace with China and advised them to invade Taiwan. Besides the Chinese official's note, there is other evidence to rely on. The land of the Taiwanese aborigines belongs to China, so this matter harms the friendly alliance between the United States and China. Now, you will be detained pending the approval of the American envoy stationed in Beijing, and a decision will be made. When you are detained, you will be treated with courtesy." Li Zhenda argued: "I was chosen and employed by the Eastern court to handle affairs in Taiwan with peaceful intentions, but I was arrested by your consul, which is a great injustice! It is also disrespectful to the peaceful nation of the East." Several days later, the Xiamen consul escorted Li Zhenda to Shanghai. Li hired a lawyer to argue that his arrest was illegal. The American Consul-General in Shanghai cited a regulation established by the American Congress in 1860, which allows envoys to Siam, China, and Eastern countries to arrest subjects who aid an ally of the United States or the internal citizens of that country in battle. However, considering that Li was hired before the war, he was released on bail.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Rambling on Emotional Contagion <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Ding Di</p>
<p>Striking the key that touches the heartstrings, causing a reader to curse, rejoice, smile, and weep along with you, you often set up an emotional collar, putting it around the necks of many people, letting them experience the atmosphere under your pen, your soul, your mood. You paint that atmosphere thick and thick, thicker, more joyful, and more sorrowful than your own, just like the exaggeration of lying. You inaccurately transform emotions specifically for the reader. To arouse the flames of anger and the caress of light and justice, the motivation for emotional exaggeration is naturally good, but the ineffective result is obvious.</p>
<p>When depicting an idea, a set of emotions, a flash of intuition, transforming them into words on paper, there is undoubtedly an atmosphere. "Red Bean" and "Blue Wutong" are brilliant atmospheres; "When will the sun perish? I will die with you!" is an atmosphere of cursing; "Jade dew withers the maple forest" is a desolate atmosphere. When you write down everything you feel, there is naturally your own special atmosphere. Whether this atmosphere is thick or thin, you should write it as it is, write down your curses, your joy, but do not curse or rejoice even more, letting the words overflow your emotions. (Rather than processing the written symbols, cultivate the essence of emotions.)</p>
<p>Naturally, there are also difficulties in exaggeration. It is especially true now that a literary worker, in order to complete a sacred task, arouse hatred, and encourage the pursuit of light, will therefore overconsider the effect. Not only writing down the emotions they feel themselves, but also writing down emotions beyond their feelings. Thus, the problem arises. Conveying what one cannot feel to others, excessive rendering of words, and fabricated atmospheres, can they disguise real emotions? I can answer this question frankly: No! Tolstoy told us in "What is Art?": "Art is a human activity consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these feelings and also experience them." The reason is very clear. To infect others, one must first have considerable emotions oneself, just as you can only sell goods to others if you have them. Anything beyond what you feel is words, not real emotions. If you haven't been moved yourself, how can others be moved.</p>
<p>Truly moving works are determined by the author's emotions. The author's personal experience of the environment, joy or sorrow, tears or smiles, rich emotions constitute a thick atmosphere. Even when written into words, this is not yet words, this is real emotion. Without any exaggeration, this emotion can strike the key that touches the heartstrings.</p>
<p>Nietzsche said, "The noblest beauty is that which does not come suddenly, does not make an intense anaesthetic stimulation." The so-called "anaesthetic stimulation" is a kind of forced infection, rather than the author's gradual influence. Only those with little life experience and careless flippancy lack emotion. Only these people specialize in writing superficial, clamorous, and unrealistic rants and moans, but I oppose that kind of intentionally exaggerated "verbal scream."</p>
<p>The reason for exaggeration is often to thicken the atmosphere of emotions, but this atmosphere is not real emotion, it is a combination of square characters. The smart way is to first train your own emotions, make your feelings run free, your consciousness correct, and your life experience rich. Then your emotions will naturally be disciplined. You don't have to exaggerate, just write down what you feel, calmly and honestly, it's already enough. You don't have to force it, people will naturally feel it. And there is no need for a "sudden attack," but the result is like the attraction of a magnet. This scream is of the "emotion" type, not the "word" type.</p>
<p>I do not oppose articles full of intense love and hate. But this atmosphere must first be experienced by the author. If not, then you must first train your own emotions. Otherwise, your heart may be well-intentioned, but the matter is useless.</p>

<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>— Snippets of a Conscript's Life</p>
<p>After drawing lots, everyone gradually exited the square. The surroundings were peaceful, quiet, as if breathing had stopped; the sun climbed to the top of the sky without a breeze, only occasional cicada sounds, dragging long tunes, horizontally passing over, dividing the deep loneliness.</p>
<p>Under heavy shade, eight hundred conscripts who had drawn lots sat around, quietly waiting for the time to enlist.</p>
<p>"It's only 12:15? How time makes fools of us!" someone said, raising his watch. He stood up impatiently, looking at the sky and the distant valleys.</p>
<p>"I wish I could fly to the front line immediately, fly beyond the mountains, and cut away in a frenzy! Release the accumulated hatred in my heart from the rapid current of fresh blood; then, carrying glorious spoils of war, slowly walk back."</p>
<p>"What's the rush? The time is not far off! There will always be a day to realize it."</p>
<p>"Yes, all the stains on the land will eventually be washed clean!"</p>
<p>"You are an artist, I believe that you will use artistic methods in the future, which will certainly be superior to our hard slashing..."</p>
<p>Several other people stood up again, walking a few steps proudly, clenching their fists.</p>
<p>Looking at the watch, it was only half an hour before enlistment.</p>
<p>On the small road, figures were floating in the distance, in twos and threes, continuously walking over from the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>They were old men, old women, young women, and children. How lively it was, bursts of laughter following and flying over. They were the families of the conscripts who had drawn lots, who had come specifically to say goodbye. Several conscripts rushed forward, shaking hands and saying happily, "I drew a lot, and I'm enlisting at two o'clock this afternoon."</p>
<p>They hugged each other and gathered into a large pile: laughing wildly, shouting, talking loudly, cheering...</p>
<p>An old gentleman with long, silver-like whiskers, lifted them and said to one who was laughing, "Child: you drew a lot, that's really lucky, you've gotten the opportunity to serve the country, I'm also happy for you! I hope you strive forward."</p>
<p>A beautiful young woman, standing beside her husband, whispered, "First there is a country, and then there is a home. Go ahead, don't be reluctant! When the day of victory comes, I will welcome you under the triumphal arch, singing a song you love to hear."</p>
<p>"If I get injured, I hope to be a wounded soldier under your care," the conscript joked to his wife.</p>
<p>There was also a child, waving his hand, stretching out his neck: "Dad: don't forget to bring back a pony."</p>
<p>Da da di da... The bugle call from the distant command platform suddenly slid across the sky; the noisy square suddenly became quiet again. Whistles sounded nervously, wave after wave, and the conscripts quickly gathered together, instantly arranged into a long snake.</p>
<p>The drill instructor ran over, began inspecting, followed by a speech, he said: "You are about to start working now. I hope you will work hard and be responsible, use your wisdom and strength to seek harvest! Your achievements are not only your own merits, but also the great glory of the local area. Therefore, from today until we part, I hope every day..."</p>
<p>Then, the × commander came to inspect: melting into an iron stream, unfolding.</p>
<p>As they rounded the field for a week, the starting bugle call broke through the sky again, the battalion adjutant blew the whistle, stepping beside the team, advancing towards the designated broken temple.</p>
<h3 id="e121">High Monk <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Fu</p>
<p>In a dilapidated old temple, there lives a high monk: he seems to live sweetly for the sake of the heavy sound of the wooden fish, pacing the path of life calmly and elegantly, without tears or laughter: all things are like passing smoke and clouds, nothing can disturb his peace of mind!</p>
<p>Who understands him? Who envies him? However, he does not wait for people's understanding, let alone people's envy. Time flies by, trees add years, and the monk adds white hair!</p>
<p>White hair is the mark of his accomplishments, gradually growing from every beat of the wooden fish. His intention is nothing more than to pour his life slantingly from the living end into the other end of stillness, so that he is not suddenly severed, but slowly traverses the rugged mountains like a flowing spring, merging into the boundless sea, and in the process, he does not want to become a waterfall leaping thousands of feet, nor does he want to become a rushing torrent. In this way, he will move from life to death without a trace. Death is his destination!</p>
<p>I understand him, and I envy him, but I hope even more that he can understand me, like me - and countless others like me in the world, will not be converted by his deeds! This is not to say that I am "unrelated", "fate" can be arbitrarily decided by subjectivity. The significant point of difference is that we love life and hate death! And even when we are happy to "draw the knife and make it quick," the minimum condition is "not to fail our youthful years"!</p>
<p>Judging from the fact that he has never nagged and annoyed people to convert, he is obviously not a vulgar monk who seeks offerings from all directions, but if you examine the merits he has accumulated, from beginning to end it shows that he is an extreme egoist, so the distance between him and the vulgar monks is only a grain of millet! So he can only benefit himself, but not save all beings. It's not that he can't make a "great vow", it's just that his heart is more than his strength, and he's afraid of too much trouble!</p>
<p>I understand him, he is a coward who cannot tolerate even the slightest pain! I also envy him, he can skillfully use the wooden fish as a confidant!</p>

<p>— by Maxim Gorky, translated by Di Zhou</p>
<p>She was surrounded by a group of drunkards. --And everything, from the madam, sisters to the cracks in the ceiling, she was more than familiar with.</p>
<p>She spoke in a rough voice, only when the guests touched her did she emit a loud laugh like a strong farmer; laughing with her whole body trembling. Among her sisters, the most stupid and the healthiest was not more fortunate than them, because she was more like a beast than them!</p>
<p>Needless to say, in this family where Vasika managed everything more strictly than anywhere else, the girls' terror and hatred for him deepened. When they got drunk, they couldn't hide this feeling and told the patrons loudly about Vasika, but because the patrons never protected them in front of Vasika, this kind of complaining had no effect. And when they hysterically shouted, Vasika heard it--his fiery face appeared at the door of the living room, saying in a cold, stiff voice:</p>
<p>"Don't mess around!..."</p>
<p>"Executioner! Exile!" the woman yelled, "Why do you beat me into a cripple? Look, sir, that guy beat me so hard with a whip,..." The shouting prostitute was about to tear open her clothes to show others.</p>
<p>At this time, Vasika walked over, grabbed her hand, and spoke in an unchanging tone--this was especially terrible--but he spared her.</p>
<p>"Don't make noise! ...Can't you be quiet? What are you making a fuss about? --You're drunk... You'll see!"</p>
<p>Usually, that's about it, only a few times did Vasika take the woman out of the living room. No matter how many prostitutes were his favorites, none of them earned a tender word from him. He only used her as a woman, choosing whoever he liked, and he would say to her:</p>
<p>"Tonight, come to your room for the night,..." Then he walked into the woman's room for a tryst, not saying a word to the woman, and left after finishing.</p>
<p>"Ah, he's a demon!" That's what the girls always said about him.</p>
<p>Almost all the girls in the brothel where he lived had direct contact, and Ajiusunia could not be spared: in fact, every time he had a relationship with her, he always cruelly ravaged her.</p>
<p>Strong, lazy, she was very sleepy. No matter how noisy it was in the living room, she often fell asleep in public. As soon as she sat down in a corner, she would stop flirting in a moment, her eyes suddenly fixed on some object, quietly putting down her eyelids and closing her eyes. And her large white teeth were exposed, her lower lip hanging down with carefree snoring, causing the guests and sisters to laugh. But laughter still couldn't wake Ajiusunia.</p>
<p>This happened to her often. The madam scolded her harshly, slapping her cheeks, but she always couldn't get rid of the sleeping demon on her. She cried for a while, then fell asleep again.</p>
<p>So Vasika had a chance to perform.</p>
<p>Once, she and a drunken guest fell asleep leaning on a chair, Vasika walked over, secretly grabbed her hand, and dragged her out. (5)</p>
<h3 id="e125">(2) On Methods of Doing Things (Continued from Yesterday) <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Xie</p>
<p>(5) There are often people who start with good intentions, attributing glory to God, but later change their original purpose because they want to satisfy their own selfish desires, so that all previous efforts are abandoned, which is very unfortunate. We must adhere to the purpose, always attributing glory to God, and not to ourselves. (6) We must not publicize the evil deeds of others. The following is evidence of pure intention: (1) A person with pure intention often puts religious affairs before secular affairs. They value cultivating the mind and practicing the Tao, and despise cultivating the body and seeking fame. They would rather sacrifice than profit. (2) If a person respects God at home as if they were in front of the public, it can be known that their intention is pure. (3) A person who often strives to do good themselves and praises the good deeds of others is evidence of pure intention. The ancient saint Moses hoped that everyone would be a prophet, which shows his spirit of impartiality. (4) They despise the rich and glorious life and are selfish. (5) They respect God in the same way when they are poor. In short, some religious things are done meaningfully, and some are done meaningless, the difference lies entirely in whether the intention is pure or not. For example, almsgiving is originally to relieve the poor, fasting is originally to restrain desires and nourish the mind, prayer is originally to seek the Tao, respect is originally to be humble, and self-restraint is originally for patience, but if it is not out of sincerity. Then, almsgiving is like the Pharisees, equal to wasting, fasting is like Jezebel, you suffer in vain, prayer is like Judas, saying one thing and meaning another, respect is like Ahab, completely hypocritical, and self-restraint is like the martyrdom of heretics, suffering in vain. Desiring external fame without internal sincerity, even if all the limbs are complete, the soul is gone, it is simply a walking corpse, what is there to cherish?

<h3 id="e126">A Parent's Plea and Suggestion <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>Two senior primary students' tuition costs a total of 150 yuan per semester, various expenses should be reduced where possible to give more students the opportunity to study.</p>
<p>My entire hometown has been sacrificed under the fire of cannons!  Not a tile above my head to shelter me, not a grain of rice in my stomach to feed me, I had no choice but to flee to this temporary refuge.</p>
<p>I planned that all my meager savings, aside from the rent for a small cubicle, could barely cover ninety months if I economized on everything else, which put my mind somewhat at ease.</p>
<p>But a big problem arose: my children's future cannot be delayed. No matter what, I must send them to school.</p>
<p>I took a look at the prospectuses of several nearby primary schools. The tuition for senior primary school was 20 to 30 yuan, plus miscellaneous fees and book fees. School A was closer, with tuition at 25 yuan, miscellaneous fees at 3 yuan, library fee at 1 yuan, and sports fee at 1 yuan, totaling 30 yuan, with books extra. Fortunately, it was close and I could save on transportation costs. I gritted my teeth and decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>I took my two children to register, paid a registration fee of 4 yuan and an examination fee of 2 yuan. The receipt stated that these fees would not be deducted from the tuition.</p>
<p>They passed the exam. I had to register and reserve a place first. New students had to pay an admission fee of 5 yuan and a school fund of 5 yuan, which also would not be deducted from the tuition. What to do? If you want to study, you need money. Of course, you have to pay!</p>
<p>School started. In addition to paying the tuition, miscellaneous fees, library fee, and sports fee, the school would handle the purchase of books, notebooks, and stationery, with a prepayment of 5 yuan and adjustments made for any overpayment or underpayment. Of course, "all fees must be paid in full before attending classes."</p>
<p>After sending them to school, I finally breathed a sigh of relief. I calculated that I had paid a total of 96 yuan. This was the cost for two students to attend senior primary school for one semester!</p>
<p>A bolt from the blue! The next day, the students came back and reported that the teacher said each student had to pay an additional 3 yuan for uniform fees, 0.5 yuan for badge fees, 0.3 yuan for school newspaper fees, and 0.2 yuan for class dues, adding another 8 yuan for the two of them. Helpless, I had to pay! Pay!</p>
<p>With great difficulty, we got through one month peacefully.</p>
<p>On the first day of the second month, the children brought back a notice: it briefly stated that the school was borrowing classrooms from another school, which was inconvenient. Now, a new location had been found, and classes would be moved to ×× Road starting immediately. Great! Another expense added for transportation and meals!</p>
<p>The semester ended, and I had to pay a 5-yuan reservation fee. I calculated that two senior primary students cost a total of 150 yuan for one semester.</p>
<p>Economically bankrupt and with no income, how could I bear such a large educational expense? Helpless, I had to let them temporarily drop out of school.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I'm sure there are many others who share my plight, so I sincerely hope that the school authorities will economize on unnecessary expenses as much as possible, reduce fees, alleviate the burden on parents, send more children to school, and achieve the ultimate goal of national education. For example, although the notebooks made by the school are uniform, beautiful, and neat, this inevitably increases costs. A notebook that costs five or six cents outside the school costs one dime inside the school, which is a big difference. Also, like the school newspaper, although there are many benefits, not having it doesn't necessarily cause harm. In these times of high prices, it is not very appropriate. Other fees, such as sports uniforms and handicraft supplies, should also be reduced where possible. Also, the layers upon layers of admission fees and basic fees seem like exorbitant taxes. I hope that the education authorities will seriously consider this and make improvements. Furthermore, I hope they will not use a small number of free slots for rewarding excellent students to attract students, but will instead substantially reduce the fees for all students. It should be known that while excellent students should be rewarded, the more numerous ordinary students, who make up the majority of the population, also need education.</p>
<p>If every school could consider all aspects of society and carefully consider the fees charged and the courses taught, then I believe that education will definitely be popularized, and the nation's future will definitely have hope.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Biographies of Female Ballad Singers <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Shen You</p>
<p>Ma Rufei and Female Ballad Singing (This section should be placed after section three) (After the first paragraph of the Japanese text)</p>
<p>It can be seen that until the end of the Jiaqing period, female ballad singers were still independent individuals, singing anywhere they pleased, without a fixed location. After the Daoguang period, they gradually gained importance, and there were venues for singing. However, in the early stages, the singers were not the so-called "courtesans"; they were still a group of "blind girls." Ma Rufei's unprinted opening ballad "What is the Most Heartbreaking Thing in the World?" satirizes their lives:</p>
<p>What is the most heartbreaking thing in the world? It's a pity for beautiful women who are blind. It's difficult to string the thread for painting dragons and embroidering phoenixes. It's not clear when boiling tea and cooking rice. They have no part in sightseeing. They can only hear the gongs and drums of the opera. Bright daylight is like cloudy rain. They can't distinguish day from night. No matter how beautiful they are compared to Xi Shi, even if men indulge in pleasure, they have no sympathy. When they grow up, they are married young. They can only learn to sing southern ballads and become female teachers. They sing little tunes on stage in a glib manner. The zither and pipa are their double shields. They wear powder and flowers on their faces. Their clothes are all silk. It's really scary to look at them directly, but romance can only be seen from behind. When they meet a soulmate on the road, they will call him. They can only hear his voice but can't see him. They don't recognize King Xiang's face on the terrace. They must be confused by the rain clouds of Wushan several times. They only call him a "beardless gentleman."</p>
<p>The "female teachers" mentioned here are actually the early "courtesans." The only difference between them and the later "courtesans" is whether they were "blind" or "not blind." Ma Rufei was in Suzhou at that time, and he expressed great dissatisfaction with the emerging "female ballad singers," especially their lives. For the dignity of the storytelling profession, he did not hesitate to launch a strong attack. "What is the Most Heartbreaking Thing in the World?" is one example. However, his opposition was not limited to this. We can also look at another of his printed opening ballads, "Yin Sheng Yang Shuai" (Feminine Dominance, Masculine Decline):</p>
<p>Feminine dominance and masculine decline have been said since ancient times. Government offices collapse, but temples are new. Suzhou's styles change every year. All the storytelling venues use female teachers. No one asks about Yan Zhiyun's three words. Old Niangniang is old and not fashionable. It's a pity that she's crude and unorthodox. The Yao sisters, aunt and sister-in-law, have Yao as their surname and Lan as their names. Zhou Yuan changes her act with a small reputation. Li Cuiyun, Jing Cuiyun, and Gusu Juiyun, the three Cuiyuns rise together. The bright face powder is three parts thick. The pitted surface must be flattened. Xu Shuzhen has faces of all over. The nine-inch head and big feet are really ugly. Walking sounds like wooden clogs. Talented, beautiful, and skilled, Lu Xiuqing is known everywhere. Gentlemen and wealthy households often come and go, entering and leaving the Yamen of Changzhou and Wuxian. Ghost stories are not necessarily true. Fang Qiuchan can play Huizhou Bai, and also has three parts of Changshu accent. Parents-in-law and parents-in-law, children's relatives and children's love. Wang Ruiyun, Ma Xiuying, without talent or beauty, are driven out of the house. Fortunately, we rely on gentry guests, who suffer this bitterness for blind ballad singers and blind teachers. There is nowhere to complain, so close your eyes.</p>
<p>In "What is the Most Heartbreaking Thing in the World?" Ma Rufei only expressed his hatred for female ballad singers, which is not of much value. But "Yin Sheng Yang Shuai" is different. It not only points out the beginning of the prosperity of female ballad singers in Suzhou, but also allows us to know the figures of early Suzhou female ballad singers. If it weren't for Rufei's opening ballad, we might never have known about these figures. "Yin Sheng Yang Shuai" can be compared with Rufei's unprinted embedded name opening ballad "Fang Qiuchan's Soul":</p>
<p>Fang Qiuchan's soul illuminates the sorrowful people. Tears fall one after another on the silk quilt. Zhang Yufeng is spread on the tooth bed. She leisurely plays the Yaoqin outside the railing. Two wild geese, Xu Yue'e, furrow her brows. Her emaciated face is lightly ill. Lying horizontally with her clothes on, the clouds are messy. Her gestures and demeanor evoke a sense of rain. Thinking that she was born to weave scenes in the clouds, she cannot see the Cowherd riding on colored clouds. She manages colored clouds without incident, and she begs for skill by ordering the moon iron according to tradition. Looking at the Milky Way, the Zhang and Kui stars appear, and a wisp of jade incense rises. A Yao heart and orchid quality are sorrowful and ill. Why is she furrowing her brows and clutching her heart? Separating from Lang Zhou has been really long. It has harmed my spirit. The dragon horse is slender and graceful. The joyful scene of the colorful clouds is easily scattered (to be continued) (6)</p>
<h3 id="e128">The Self-Renewal Movement <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>Can the 14 Provisions on Thrift Be Achieved? Can the Following Five Articles on Eliminating Addictions Be Achieved?</p>
<p>In all provinces and cities across the country, even in remote rural areas, people are living simple wartime lives to save material resources for proper use. Only Shanghai seems to be an exception. It is filled with a prosperous atmosphere of singing and dancing everywhere. The general public is immersed in a luxurious, decadent, and lazy life of pleasure, which has not diminished to this day. How regrettable it is that these useful human and material resources are being wasted in that vortex? In the past, there were "Thrift Movement" and "Ten No's Movement," which achieved considerable success. Now, the United Christian Student Associations have launched a "Self-Renewal Movement."</p>
<p>In principle, true Christians have an absolutely firm spirit of belief and obedience to religious rules and other rules. For example, they always adhere to small matters such as not smoking or drinking. Therefore, movements initiated by religious groups individually are more effective than social organizations or publicity that correct bad habits with a general and universal target audience.</p>
<p>Although the current "Self-Renewal Movement" targets students, the "Rebirth Goals" it has established are more active and substantial than the regulations of previous movements. Regarding thrift, there are fourteen articles: (1) I establish and strictly implement a personal budget system and develop the habit of keeping daily accounts; (2) I will not make new clothes, and when I must make them, I will not make expensive and luxurious ones; (3) I will not have the idea of disliking the old and liking the new for daily necessities; (4) I will use less cosmetics, not wear silk stockings, and not perm my hair; (5) I will not use fancy envelopes and stationery for writing letters; (6) I will reduce eating snacks; (7) I will not travel first class; (8) I will take fewer photos when visiting parks; (9) I will not hold frequent dinners… (10) I will reduce spending during festivals; (11) I will practice thrift in my life and donate the money I save each month to the country and those who are suffering; (12) I will do my best to serve student groups or social charity and educational work; (13) I will not trouble others with my own affairs; (14) I will pay attention to the lives of the masses, and I will have more opportunities to approach them, understand them, and help them.</p>
<p>Regarding eliminating addictions, there are also five articles: (1) Proper entertainment is the vitamin of life. I will use sports, music, chess, painting, writing, and other hobbies, as well as group life, to replace improper entertainment; (2) I will reduce the number of movies I watch… (3) I will not go to entertainment venues that are unconscious or of low taste; (4) I will not gamble or play mahjong; (5) I will not smoke or drink.</p>
<p>Although the above regulations cannot be said to be perfect, the effect they can produce can be said to make every penny not go to useless places, and make every person not be a parasite of the country and society. Concentrating human and material resources on the welfare of the country and society is beneficial to the country and society on the one hand, and indirectly brings blessings to oneself on the other hand. To put it more plainly: correcting bad habits and developing a spirit of hard work can cope with more difficult living environments; saving all extravagant and wasteful money can be used to relieve the suffering of refugees or to support one's own life in the future. At present, being addicted to improper enjoyment cannot be said to definitely lead to depravity, but at least it hinders a person's progressive thoughts and actions. Therefore, it is indeed necessary to practice thrift. The group that initiated the "Rebirth Goals" hopes that the academic community in various provinces and cities will respond and fulfill them. However, non-academics may also automatically fulfill them and further seek possible expansion of the scope.</p>

<h3 id="e130">The Raw Materials and Origin of Rainproof Straw Hats <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Runzi</p>
<p>Anything that can serve two purposes is, of course, most popular. For example, six or seven years ago, a kind of rainproof cloth was popular. It was said that ordinary native factory woolen cloth was soaked in some kind of chemical raw material and then taken out, it would have the effect of resisting dampness and rain. However, the essence of the cloth would not show any traces. So, on a sunny day, it could be worn as a long robe; in rainy weather, it could be used as a raincoat. Recently, a kind of rainproof straw hat has suddenly become popular on the market, just like the rainproof cloth a few years ago. The owners seem to know that customers have some doubts, so in order to prove their honesty and trustworthiness, they put the rainproof straw hats in a water tank in the display window for people to see, showing that it does have the rainproof effect of not changing when it gets wet. As a result, some friends who have worn Panama, Little Luzon, and straw hats that go out of shape when it rains cannot resist the smoke screen propaganda of these "rainproof" hats and switch to these rainproof straw hats of unknown origin.</p>
<p>Friends who don't know what the raw materials of rainproof straw hats are made of may suspect that these rainproof straw hats are made of rubber because of the publicity of the word "rainproof," or that they are made of some kind of chemical substance. In fact, to reveal the secret, the raw material of rainproof straw hats is paper. However, what is shipped to our country is semi-finished product. As long as a thin layer of spray paint is added, the so-called rainproof straw hat is successfully made. Therefore, the ones sold by Merchant A are crowned with the brand of Merchant A; the ones sold by Merchant B are crowned with the name of Merchant B. People who don't know the inside story always think that it is a completely domestic product, but who knows that its origin is so vague! Even if we take a step back and put aside emotions, and only talk about economic conditions: since it is a thing made of paper, no matter how beautiful its appearance is, it can be asserted that it will not be durable. As for the rainproof problem, how long can it last with only a thin layer of spray paint? Naturally, it becomes a question again. What's more, if the spray paint has been on for a long time, it will fall off. At that time, it will be mottled. I am afraid that not only will it not be able to prevent rain, but it will also be a little embarrassing to use it to block the sun.</p>

<h3 id="e131">A General Review of Hou Yulan (Part 1) <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Meihua Pavilion Master</p>
<p>Absolutely No Doubt She Will Become Popular</p>
<p>Hou Yulan, 19 years old, is from Beiping. She loved drama from a young age. At the age of fifteen, she was admitted to the China Senior Opera Vocational School. At that time, Zhao Jinrong was the most popular student in the school who practiced Qingyi, and her reputation spread throughout the north and south. Yulan's family was poor. Her mother, Mrs. Wen, supported herself by needlework. Yulan hoped to acquire a skill to support her mother, so she studied diligently and worked hard to improve herself.</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Jin Zhongsun (Zhao Yan, hao Huilu) took over the management of the opera school. Whenever famous actors performed, he would send students to observe and imitate. Hou Yulan followed Cheng (Yanqiu), Wang Jinlu followed Yang (Xiaolou), Wang Helin followed Ma (Yunliang), Li Yuru followed Xun (Huisheng)... all because of this. (The opera school focused on group performances and did not promote individuals, so there were many talented people, but few people in Shanghai knew about them. However, Song Dezhu has been deeply known to the people of Shanghai through the introduction of the Half-Month Drama.) Yulan admired Yu Shuang and watched every performance. She paid attention to every aspect of Cheng's singing, acting, reciting, fighting, hand movements, eye movements, body movements, and footwork. After class, she recited it in her mouth and thought about it in her heart, studying and practicing it. Yu Shuang also often gave guidance, so she was able to become a successful Cheng-style talent.</p>
<p>Yulan's singing style followed Cheng's and she grasped the essence of it. A recording company admired her talent and once paid her a lot of money to record a disc of "Peacock Flies Southeast," which was briefly in circulation and sold very well. Yu Shuang's proud works are all Yulan's forte. The play "Peacock Flies Southeast" was originally one of the four new plays that Yu Shuang planned to arrange and donate to the opera school for public performance. When the public performance of this play was first decided, Zhao Jinrong was first appointed as the protagonist and Wang Yaoqing was the director. Later, Yulan was assigned to star in the play, and Yu Shuang personally gave guidance. Several performances were decided, and all received high praise. Therefore, this play is not only Yulan's representative work, but also one of the opera school's representative works. Since then, female actors in the old capital have all imitated it. Some changed the name to "Zhongqing and Lanzhi," some changed the name to "Jiao Zhongqing," and some changed the name to "Tears of Life and Death." Because the China Opera School has the exclusive performance rights to this play, imitators had to change the name of the play. However, the great power of its magic can also be seen in this.</p>
<p>Yulan's acting style also followed Yu Shuang's. Chen Moxiang said that Yu Shuang's water sleeve skills were unprecedented. Yu Xie praised Yulan's water sleeve skills for being wonderfully natural. Yulan's skills such as running the garden and entering the kiln door are similar to Yu Shuang's, which can be seen in the play "Wujiapo." Yulan's art followed Yu Shuang's, and she also taught morality and studied diligently, which is similar to Yu Shuang's "art advancing to the Tao." Therefore, everyone calls her "Female Yanqiu."</p>
<p>Yulan's favorite plays, in terms of old plays, are Yutangchun, Wang Baochuan, Visiting Mother and Returning Order, Shilian Lamp, Golden Lock Record, Zhuhen Record, Cursing the Palace, Teaching the Son, Meiyu Match, Yanmen Pass, etc. Before graduating, she already had the aura of a master. In terms of new plays, it is unlikely that they will be staged due to the problem of supporting roles. Yulan's appearance is similar to Wan Hua's, and Ling Xiaohan Pavilion calls her "Sai Lanfang" and "Female Lord Hou." There is an article as proof:</p>
<p>I call Hou Yulan "Sai Lanfang," and my friends call her "Female Yanqiu," which is not impossible. The nickname is nothing more than publicity, and success still depends on oneself.</p>
<p>Speaking of this "Female Lord Hou," it was obvious from three or four years ago that she was "an amazing talent." Her appearance is dignified and beautiful, which is enough for people to "see"; her singing is loud and sharp, which is enough for people to "hear." To say that she combines the strengths of Mei and Cheng would be an exaggeration; to say that she is limited to one school or one faction would also be a disservice. She seems to be constantly paying attention to the strengths of her predecessors and using them. This is one of the reasons for Mei and Cheng's success. This is how she is amazing, really amazing!</p>

<h3 id="e132">Trip to the Philippines <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xuan</p>
<p>Editor's introduction: Zhou Xuan is currently the only female star of Guohua Company. She showed her talent in her early years when she was engaged in singing and dancing. Four years ago, she began to appear on the screen and acted in many films. Her famous work was Yuan Muzhi's "Street Angel." Her recent works, such as "Meng Jiangnu" and "Li Sanniang," also have unique styles and can give the general audience more goodwill.</p>
<p>I have never traveled far before. After the outbreak of the war, I suddenly traveled thousands of miles to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It was in the winter of the year before last, not long after the Shanghai-Songhu anti-Japanese war line moved west. Someone from the Philippines came to negotiate and invited me to participate in the performance, saying that it was to raise funds for disaster relief. I thought: It's too boring in Shanghai. This is a good opportunity to change the air. At the same time, it is also a suitable opportunity to do what I should do in the drama post. So, I immediately went south with Mr. Yan Hua and them.</p>
<p>This troupe was called "China Kaleidoscope," and it was formed temporarily. In addition to the drama group with me as the protagonist, it also included Peking opera, singing and dancing, and other kinds of entertainment. There were more than 30 members in the entire troupe. We first gathered in Hong Kong, where we made costumes, practiced hard, and stayed for nearly two months before departing.</p>
<p>From Hong Kong to the Philippines, it only takes three days. This place is already in the tropical region. As the large mail ship gradually advanced in the ocean, it became hotter and hotter every day. Because the sea breeze was very strong, it didn't feel too bad. But when we arrived at the port and landed, it was even hotter than the hottest days of summer, almost to the point of "passing out from the heat." Really, going from Hong Kong to here is just like running out of an air-conditioned movie theater into the blazing sun, which is completely different.</p>
<p>Miss Zhou Xuan took a photo in the Philippines wearing local native clothes.</p>

<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>The success of literary works being adapted to the screen has been seen many times. In the past, such as Ms. Pearl S. Buck's "The Good Earth," and recently such as Mr. Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion," and Ms. Mitchell's "Gone with the Wind," etc., have achieved very good results. Twentieth Century Fox recently decided to start filming the world literary masterpiece "The Blue Bird." This book is a poetic drama by the Belgian modern writer Maurice Maeterlinck. Maeterlinck won the Nobel Prize for Literature for this play. Paramount had previously decided to start filming, but Fox bought the film rights for 35,000 gold pieces. It has been decided that the blue bird's protagonist will be played by the leading box office superstar Shirley Temple. Fox Changju means that Shirley Temple has now entered adolescence and should no longer play children's films, so she will try a literary script. This can be said to be a touchstone for Shirley Temple's acting skills. Whether her style can continue to be appreciated, The Blue Bird is a key to success or failure.</p>

<p>Kun Dan Hua Cuiqin of the Grand World Great Beijing Opera Troupe has been hired by the Tianchan Stage and will join the troupe from the 16th. The troupe will look for other talents. The other day, Kun Dan Chen Yanfang fired a cannon at the daily show, performing the play Yutangchun. If it is successful, she will switch generals with Hua Cuiqin. The seven-book grand drama "Hong Bi Yuan" of the troupe has been rehearsed in detail the night before and the drama photos have been taken.</p>
<p>The Old Third Zhengsunxiang Chaozhou Opera of the Queen's Theater has signed a three-month contract, which will expire on August 16, and will no longer be renewed. Someone is now introducing the Kunji Hongchun Society Tongling Class, which is performing in Nanjing. The owner of the theater, Yang Hongzhi, is still considering it. Someone also intends to rent the theater to perform Yue opera led by Yao Shuijuan, and negotiations are also underway.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Unofficial History of the Pear Garden <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Xu Biyun Violates the Taboo of the Pear Garden White Tiger</p>
<p>Xu Biyun is the fourth son of the famous Xiaosheng Xu Guifang. He and Xu Lanyuan and Xu Binshou are all brothers. At first, he studied Wudan at the Binqing Society presided over by Yu Zhenting. His Wugong skills were extremely skilled. Therefore, after he became famous, he often acted as Lu Wenlong in "Eight Great Hammers." Not only were his skills and spear movements worth watching, but he also had the posture of a Wu Xiaosheng, without the awkwardness of others who occasionally cross-dressed. One reason is because his family's knowledge can be traced back to its origin, and the second is because his foundation was well laid, so his performances can be approved by the audience. There is also another layer. His hard work in jumping in "Green Pearl Falls from the Building" and his sword dance in "Farewell My Concubine" are also difficult for the average famous Dan to achieve now. After leaving the school, he married Lanfang. Seeing the popularity of Mei everywhere, he abandoned his wood profession (Wudan) and asked Mei for advice and changed to learn Mei-style Huashan. At the same time, his uncle Wu Caixia was also a famous Zhengong Qingyi, who loved him very much and often taught him some good tunes. Therefore, his voice and singing were very well-behaved and generous when he first became famous. More than ten years ago, Gaoting Company recorded his "Baolian Lantern" and "Woman Escorting Criminals." That kind of natural singing voice was indeed very rare. Meng Siye (nicknamed Meng Siyouzi), the manager of Ruifuxiang in Beiping, greatly appreciated his art and accepted him as his adopted son. The company is the largest silk, satin and fur shop in the old capital. When it comes to the Meng boss of the Xiang brand, everyone knows it. Since Biyun worshipped this adopted father, not only was there someone to support him, and every performance sold out, but all his newly made costumes were made of the best materials selected from Ruifuxiang. When singing Huashan, the first thing to pay attention to is beautiful costumes. Lanfang has more and newer costumes than anyone else. However, Biyun tried his best to compete with him, desperately adding new clothes, and it was all free, so he was naturally happy to show off. (56)</p>
<h3 id="e136">Completion of the Chinese Capital Air Combat Film "A Skyful of Ten Thousand Miles" <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Hui Cun</p>
<p>To be transported to various locations for screening in the autumn of this year</p>
<p>Since the August 13th War of Resistance, "China Electric" [Zhong Dian, likely a film studio] had to move from Nanjing to Wuhu, then from Wuhu to Wuhan, and then from Wuhan to Chongqing due to environmental reasons. These three relocations significantly reduced work efficiency, which is a natural reason for the reduced output.</p>
<p>Despite the constraints of the environment, which prevented them from producing as much as they could, all the staff worked diligently to complete films such as "Eastern Battlefield," "Shanghai Frontline," "Active Western Money," "Ninth Month of the War of Resistance," and "Great Battle of Taierzhuang."</p>
<p>After moving to Chongqing, under the leadership of director Luo Xuelian, a new studio was established, the organization was restructured, and talents were widely recruited. In terms of writing and directing, there were Shen Xiling, Xu Suling, He Feiguang, Sun Yu, Pan Zienong, Yu Zhongying, Zhou Ke, and others. The actors included Gao Zhanfei, Bai Yang, Gu Eryi, Wei Heling, Shi Chao, Zhao Dan, Ying Yin, Chen Yiping, Kang Jian, and others.</p>
<p>After the internal adjustments at "China Electric," work was actively resumed. Major films that have been completed include "Bloody Battle in an Isolated City," directed by Xu Suling and starring Bai Yang and others, and "Sons and Daughters of China," written and directed by Shen Xiling and starring Bai Yang, Zhao Dan, Gu Eryi, Wei Heling, Shi Chao, and others. Due to transportation difficulties in the inland areas and limited supplies, the pace of work could not be accelerated. However, every effort was made to ensure the quality of the content, from filming, developing, editing, and organizing to completion. Everything was done with great care.</p>
<p>After the "May Fourth Fire" [likely a specific incident, not the historical May Fourth Movement], the filming work of "China Electric" was affected, and it was even more difficult to start filming outdoor scenes. The air combat film "A Skyful of Ten Thousand Miles," which was originally scheduled to be completed earlier, was temporarily put on hold because there were still two outdoor scenes that had not been filmed. It was not until the Chongqing urban area returned to normal that the filming of outdoor scenes began. As of now, the film has been completely completed. After washing, editing, and organizing, it will be ready to be screened in Chongqing and transported to various locations in the autumn of this year. The film is written and directed by Sun Yu and stars Gao Zhanfei, Bai Yang, and others. It is based on the heroic Air Force, which has repeatedly performed remarkable feats. With the assistance of the Aviation Committee, members of the Air Force who participated in the expeditions to the three islands and bombed Taiwan were specially invited to participate in the performances. There is also a real-life record of our Air Force sinking Japanese warships in the Yangtze River. The greatness and grandeur of the entire film can be imagined.</p>
<p>In addition, films that are still in production include "Mother of the Nation," which is based on the story of Grandma Zhao leading a guerrilla team, "Wandering Children," written and directed by Yu Zhongying, and "Protect Our Homeland," directed by He Feiguang and performed by all the film artists. There are a total of fourteen screenplays and actors that have been booked but have not yet started filming. "China Electric" headquarters expects that these fourteen films will all be completed within the next year.</p>
<p>Recently, the studio has also established a touring screening team. Whenever a new film is produced, it is first brought to various places for screening, so that even people in remote and backward areas can have a glimpse of the great trend of our great War of Resistance. Film's contribution to the promotion of the War of Resistance is indeed of great help.</p>

<p>Designed by Huagai Architectural Firm</p>
<p>This publication reported yesterday about the reconstruction of a new type of cinema on the site of the former Summer Peck [likely a location]. It is now known that construction has already begun on the site, and it is expected to be fully completed within three months. The internal and all engineering designs are being undertaken by architect Chen Zhi of Huagai Architectural Firm, commissioned by the Far East Company. Mr. Chen is a famous architect in Shanghai and is good at designing theaters and cinemas. The Grand Shanghai Cinema is also one of the engineering projects designed by the firm. According to Mr. Chen, once the cinema is reconstructed, its internal magnificence, the comfort of the seating and sight lines, and the completeness of the air conditioning will add a unique splendor to the large cinemas in this city.</p>

<p>Cannon 7 moves to 1, Horse 9 advances to 8, Cannon 1 advances 1 (Draw)</p>
<p>Game Analysis: We select and publish games by famous players in this column that match the opening setup, so that students can easily refer to them. Chariot 1 moving to 4 against the Chariot is too hasty and does not seem to be the right time. Black's Soldier 9 advancing 1 seems very plain on the surface, but it is actually a key move. If White moves first, Soldier 1 advancing 1 would make it difficult for White's side horse to find a way out for a while. White's Cannon 2 advancing 1 to protect the soldier retains the strength in the later endgame. Black's Chariot 2 retreating 2, although it is a retreat, is a way to advance by retreating, concealing the move Chariot 2 moving to 6 to check, and then 6 advancing 2 to capture both. Soldier 7 advancing 1 is a conservative key move by White. At this time, in the situation of this game, Black has a great ability to attack, and White can only defend for a draw. The reason is that the exchange of chariots was inappropriate. It should not have been exchanged when it was exchanged. It is called an unnecessary move. One move falters, resulting in the loss of counter-attacking power.</p>
