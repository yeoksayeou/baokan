<h3>張伯倫在下議員聲明　英國遠東政策無變更　日本僅望其諒解去困難與主張　九國公約各項原則不受影響　正式談判何人開始尙難逆覩</h3>
<p>（倫敦）下議院本日午後開會時、張伯倫首相曾就遠東時局發出聲明云、「日本與　國各報、近頃載有各種談片、稱日本政府將要求吾國澈底變更遠東政策、以爲開始談判之條件、茲特明白聲言、吾國外交政策自有權衡、不擬接受他國之要求、亦未便接受他國之要求、而有所改變、（各議員大聲歡呼）、且以事宣言之、吾人亦未自日本政府接獲此種要求、按之吾國駐日大使克萊琪爵士所見、日本正式態度、實以下述數點爲比較確當之輪廓、卽該國希望英國對於中日戰事所作之觀察、務於日方之困難與主張、予以相當諒解、茲若遽以日本政府爲具有某種意向、則此類並非必然之假定、徒足以影響談判而妨碍共成功、克萊琪大使此種看法、政府亦所贊同、至於正式談判何日始能開始、茲尚難以逆覩、按之東京方面所發表之公告、克萊琦大使曾於本月十五日、在日本外相官邸、與有田外相、就構成天津局勢之一般背景問題、作友好之討論、並經決定延期談話、俾雙方從容考慮現所涉及之各項問題、至以天津局勢而論、在大體上言之、已見改善、並有充分食物運入租界、牛乳之接濟、亦能敷用、此外、在華北某某地方、曾經發生反英示威運動、山西省英國教會產業、略受損害、又在汕頭方面、日本當局曾經發出正式通告、稱各國船舶倘不妨礙軍事行動、可在某種條伴之下、聽其駛入汕頭港、但每星期以一艘爲限、關於此層、英日兩國當局現正進行談判、在福州則有英國少數僑民、業已退出、」至是、首相乃涉及英國駐華大使館陸軍武官史比亞中校被捕事云、「日本政府業已通知克萊琦大使、或謂史比亞中校殆已受鞫審、日本政府將賡續進行調査云云、克萊琦大使卽因未能滿意於此種程序、愛向日本政府作最强硬之交涉、並請其准許能操日語之英國軍官一員、前往張家口」、反對派自由黨領袖辛克萊爵士旋卽提出詢問云、「史比亞中校理應享受外交官特權、今茲首相所言、擬派能操日語之軍官前往張家口、俾與史比亞中校相接觸、此共意義、豈卽政府已不復要求日本、立卽予以釋放歟」、張伯倫首相當卽答稱、「決無此事、余謂、英國駐日大使館業已向日本政府提出最强硬之交涉、要求釋放史比亞中校」云、（十七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>工黨議員漢德森起問、首相是吾意謂東京談判將以天津地方事件爲限、英政府不贊同背離美國及其他政府而討論九國公的原則之任何修正、首相答曰、余意實如此、惟余已言之矣、政府未接日政府此種任何要求、工黨議員諾爾貝克曾建議、英政府應照會日政府告以日本之侵犯中國、實爲一種國聯所痛斥之侵略行爲、且屬一種違反人道之罪惡、如能終止、則英日間之一切懸案、自可迎刃而解云云、首相乃於答一復各决補充問話時宣稱、渠認爲此項建議並非甚有益者、</p>
<p>工黨議員索林森繼間、中國淪陷區域之其他部份、曾否發生暴行事件、首相答稱、渠意此種暴行、多發生於日軍佔領之各城市、此外之區域、則未聞有此類事件發生、工黨議員達爾賴亦問及東京英大使館門外之示威情形、首相答稱、就渠所知、係有大批日人列隊游行、並在英大使前門前示威致引起警察之干預、渠意現時該處已一切安謐矣、工黨議員佛萊輙問云、自首相宣言必須以停止此項暴行爲對日談判條件之一以後、天津方面曾否續有對英僑暴行事發生、首相答稱、渠曾見一報告、內稱日方對於英僑出入租界、續訂有若干限制、渠意此種限制、並不與英政府以前所中訴之暴行相侔、前外相艾登起間云、日政府並未申請將各問題之範圍擴大至天津地方事件之外、是吾得悉之、首相答稱、渠並未作此語、克萊琪爵士與日外相有田之談話，曾將日政府所認爲考慮天津事件所應守之輪廓、商妥大要、惟日政府並未建議應以討論或解決一般問題爲談判之條件、自由黨領袖辛克萊至是起問、現是吾已派諳日語之軍官一員往與史比亞接觸、英政府是吾已放棄立即開釋史氏之要求、史氏理應享受外交官特免權、首相答未、確未放棄、克萊琪爵士已向日政府作甚強硬之交涉、而要求開釋史比亞、余已言之矣、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<h3>天津局勢無變化　各地反英潮滋長</h3>
<p>（東京）據今日此間所接天津日方消息、天津未發生意外事件、日當局對於控制時局、頗有把握、惟華北共他各地則有反英事件數起、開封方面之華當局已要求英僑在規定時期內撤退、同時山海關方面則有英士兵一人被華人開槍襲擊、中國羣衆之反英情緒日見滋長、自津案發生以來、反英暴動已見加劇、哈爾濱日方消息、該處日僑今日舉行反英羣衆大會、當時有人發表激烈之演說、高呼「打倒英國」口號、復據漢口方面日人消息、武漢新聞協會已致電平沼首相。米內海相。板垣陸相。及其他軍事領袖、聲明該會抱剷除英國在華勢力爲目的、願贊助日當局所施之反英政策、據濟南消息。魯「省政府主席」與濟南「市政府主席」今日均致電日政府及天津日本陸軍外交當局、請竭力告成國策、並膺懲妨礙東亞新秩序成立之英國、豫省新鄕西某煤礦工人亦開會、通過促請日政府排斥遠東英人利益之決議案云、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<h3>史披亞尙未　正式受審</h3>
<p>（北平）據此間日軍發言人稱、英大使館軍事參贊史披亞、現尚正式受軍事法庭之審詢、日方雖已對史氏作過一度之詢問、但共目的純在査究史氏之行動、對於日方有無不利之處、同時在史氏於五月二十六日被捕時、其行動是吾站在英國軍事參贊之地位、至於軍事法庭對於史氏究將執行公開審判、抑將僅作秘密審詢、該發言人認爲不便宣露、（十七日美聯社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>華北鈔票問題</h3>
<p>自法幣政策實行以來，發行集中，準備集中，鈔票無復銀行之別，地域之分，基礎穩定，信用卓立，遐邇一統，流通稱便。及去年三月中，因北方有「聯鈔」之推行，欲一舉收華北各銀行鈔票而消滅之；消息南來，稍見梗滯，然以銀行當局一再聲明，不爲局部影響，而摧殘整個法幣之信用，勸人民照常使用，人民遂安之。及至近頃，市上流言紛起，商民惑於流言，對於各色鈔票，不免有所選擇，於是論行論地，意爲抑揚，影響所及，或稱之爲雜鈔；惟以流言之不利於雜鈔，雜鈔乃愈見其多，然而行使也如故。乃昨日忽傳惡耗，謂各銀行拒收華北地名之鈔票；事出突然，持有者或圖行使而不得，十百相傳，市面爲之驚惶，是誠大可注意之一現象也。</p>
<p>華北鈔票發生問題之原因，傳說至不一，的略言之：（一）謂有關匯兌。蓋同一法幣，而在華北發行之法幣，因特殊情形，其値常低於滬市；允低之際，大抵爲津交法幣一百三十餘元，可兌上海法幣百元，質言之，華北地名之法幣，折合滬上法幣，只値七角數分耳。加之近來因津租界封鎖之影響，人心惶惶，外匯奇貴，如天津英匯最低曾至四便士七五；假使天津塞出外匯收進法幣，再至上海結進外匯，如是一轉移間，獲利至豐，然此非有特殊勢力者不辦。因之，有某方運來華北鈔票四千萬元，在滬收買外匯之說；夫此類吸收現貨外匯，拋出期匯，事誠有之，但市上所見之中交津鈔，固不始於最近，且聞外商銀行買賣外匯所授受之法幣，雜鈔固不收受，檢點又極嚴密，甚至非一式之鈔票，尚須另行貼水，則華北鈔票縱有大批運滬，只要華商銀行加之意焉，何慮其有傾塞之可能。（二）謂有關存銀。當日人封鎖津租界之始，即揚言務獲天津存銀五千餘萬元，並以爲英日談判條件之一。夫英日談判，猶在發軔中；英人旣信誓旦旦，維持中國法幣，決無破壞中國法幣信用之舉；若將存銀移交於日人，以謀津案解決，我人可信英人之決不出此。何况法幣準備集中，天津存銀非即華北鈔票之準備；津銀固未許刦持，即使不幸，亦何與於華北鈔票？然則此說亦未可信也。（三）謂有關搗把。意謂政府未聞有若何表示，僅爲若干銀行之拒用；上違法幣政令，下抑持鈔平民，徒謀漁利於抑揚之間而已云。此說也，我人亦病其眞憑實據之不足，竊疑若干銀行力量不足濟惡，抑貿然出此，喪心病在豈至斯極！</p>
<p>拒用華北鈔票之原因，有如上述三種傳說，莫衷一是，或且皆非；要之，尚難了然。拒用之範圍，或將爲華北以外之各地，或限於上海，或祇上海之若干銀行與兌換店，亦待事實證明。拒用之性質，或以暫時堵截，或以整個計畫，或出於破壞法幣之陰謀，或有其保全法幣之苦衷；數者逈殊，非經探討，無從診斷。竊意國民政府財政當局，應對本問題有所作爲，無論爲正面之說明，爲側面之表示，或厲行，或糾正；必居其一，不可緩也。</p>
<p>抑吾人猶欲有說於此現象者：（一）此項鈔票旣遭拒用，即無法强用；則毀棄固屬不必，而亟亟於貶價以求脫手，亦非事理之正；謂求脫手而大受損失，是猶末節耳。蓋毋甯保持之，以待財政當局之指示。（二）大局若斯，所貴乎大衆沉着忍痛而守規律；此乃减少國族艱危，减少私人不必要之損失之重要信條，固不惟處分所持華北鈔票之一問題，應如是而已。蓋華北鈔票不能流通之影響，此在華北，一面幾乎有助長所謂「聯鈔」之觀，一面亦有緩弛榨取華北鈔票之效；此在上海，一面使持有華北鈔票之商民蒙其損失，一面亦使捆載華北鈔票南來易取一般鈔票與外匯者，無所施其技。要知所謂華北鈔票雖在上海亦有其相當數量，究以集散於華北者爲多；兩地隔閡，每每來歷不明；正常商民而持有大宗北鈔，或有其人，要仍以正當爲例外。凡事利弊相隨，亦必得失相權；故在財政當局未予指示之今日，必以靜待指示爲計之得也。</p>
<h3>英日意見對立　第二次談話展期　倫敦硏究克萊琪報吿雙方報紙均任務悲觀論</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　倫敦已接得英國駐日大使克萊琪與日外相有田初决會談之報告、刻正加以考慮、路透社探悉，下决會議日期尚未確定、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日外相有田與英國駐日大使克萊琪爵士、原定今日下午舉行第二次晤談、現已展至星期三日、據稱、係因英政府致英大使之訓令遲到云、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　路透社外交訪員探悉、英政府現正考慮駐日大使克萊琪爵士關於天津事件與日外相有田晤談之報告、在英政府未以共意見通知克萊琪時、克萊琪與有田之會議、似不致繼續舉行（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　今晨各報皆於封面登載星期六日英日在東京所作之「口頭交錄、」各報現皆密切注意全面辯論之信號、新聞紀事報外交訪員巴特萊特（下院議員）稱、英國駐日大使克萊琪爵士與日外相有田第一决會談、爲「長而不得要領之會晤、又謂、如日方堅持（料必出此）英國對日本在華之「新政策」「應予合作之要求、則英政府殆將以此問題提交美法及九國公的共他簽字國、徵求意見云、每日電報載社論、承認星期六日會談之進程、迄未透露詳情、但稱、假使其宣露雙方對於談話之範圍、意見大相歧異、亦不足爲異、日方如堅持共態度、則此會可獲良好結果之希望殊覺式微、該報堅主日人在津行動之幕後眞正目的、無妥協之可言、又謂、日本反英運動中所稱、「中國無英國之援助、則日本可早日告成征服全功」云云、實爲彰明的荒謬之論云、泰晤士報謂、非俟英政府以充分時間考慮克萊琪爵士所提出之情報後、東京會議似不致有多大進步、假使日方對日本陸軍態度之解釋、乃豫示日方圖將談判範圍擴張至天津爭案以外、則該會議絕難獲有任何結果、而將陷於僵局、該報又討論談判失敗後日陸軍所將加諸英人之其他壓迫方式、如由具服從性之華人作反英暴動之類、謂日方如果出此、不足陷天津英僑於危險、且有種種理由、使美國以甚友好的中立之充分利益、給予中國云、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　現有漸明顯者、日外相有田刻催迫英大使克萊琪、在處理天津事件以前、討論關於中國之一般問題、日報所載克萊琪業已表示願意依此辦理之說、自未可輕信、惟克萊琪大使當然不得不聆聽有田對於造成天津現狀之背景之一般原則所發表之意見、朝日新聞謂、英日雙方頗有隔閡、大的須再開若干决會議、始能在此問題與共牽涉之原則、成立基本諒解、英日談話能否成功、本星期杪可見分曉、日日新聞謂、談話結果未許樂觀云、（十七日路透電）</p>

<h3>上海停用華北法幣問題</h3>
<p>（一）　愼行</p>
<p>本巿中國交通兩銀行，自昨日起，對於華北地名（如天津山東靑島濟南等）之法幣，因天津申匯之匯水　高，實告暫停收受，影響所及，木市工商界對於此項法幣，亦行拒用。查本市拒用華北地名法幣之事，去年三月間亦會一度發生，嗣以中交兩銀行照常收受，風潮旋即平息，一年餘來，人民於此一事件，亦淡然若忘焉。不意此决以天津申匯之不斷上升，最高會達一百三十八元之鉅（即津交法幣一百三十八元，申付法幣一百元，最近爲一百三十二三元）乃不得不拒絕收用，藉以杜塞華北法幣之南流，防止兩銀行匯兌上之耗損，而絕投機奸商牟剎之途徑。</p>
<p>抑華北法幣之停用，其意義初不止此而已，嘗考近數月來，天津申匯之漲跌，皆視津滬兩地外匯之差度爲轉移，過去匯價之相距有限，申匯尚能維持其平衡。乃者一月以來，天津受日軍封鎖之影饗，人心虛弱，外匯變動，失其常軌，最低紀錄，英滙曾軟至四便士七五，美匯亦不過九元二角五分，（本月八日及十日）設與上海之行市，以爲對比，則英匯六便士五六二五，與美匯十二元七八一二五之水準，依然維持。吾人若能以此套匯之經營，即在天津拋售外厭，收入法幣，設法運至上海，補進外匯，一轉手間，獲利彌豐，惟値諸特殊環境，吾人雖知其然，亦屬無由問鼎，其能經營自如者，自非少數特殊人物而莫屬，如此套匯不僅影響法幣之基礎，而具損蝕外匯基金之意味，中交兩銀行之斷然停付，亦有其不得已之苦衷，吾人未便貿然加以若何之非難焉。</p>
<p>惟自法幣政策實施以來，過去之發行畛域，早經消除，華北地名法幣之流入此間者，數亦不少。此决　加停用，雖聞有改付華北匯票之說，亦僅少數人可以暫匯平津，以待較佳之機緣，然彼小工小商之持有此項零數法幣者，事前卽未予相當之準備，殆將因此而不知所止，若不早謀善後，徒貽奸徒以中傷法幣之口實，其不智孰甚，尚望兩行當局於此三致意也。</p>
<p>（二）　英君</p>
<p>華北地名中交法幣，近日市面本來均可通用，但自昨日中交停止兌換華北地名鈔票以後，如晴天霹靂，全市金融界均以此問題爲談論中心，而一般持有鈔票，漠然不知，據云，係因匯兌行市關係，以免投機者取巧，查津滬匯兌行市，最大係在本月八日，價爲一百三十八元，即天津法幣一百三十八元合上海法幣一百元，亦即華北法幣一元，祗値上海法幣七角二分四厘，至上週六（十五日）津滬匯兌已回升至一百三十二元，即合上海法幣七角五分强，昨日價爲一百三十三元，亦合七角五分餘，而中交兩行不於事前聲明，昨日　行停止兌換，使一般市民與貧苦者所收之鈔票，無處可兌，烟兌店乘機收兌收取貼費，據云昨日每百元已需貼十元，祇兌九十元，亦有七折兌換，天津紙幣發行額，據最近報告，共計三萬三千二百二十四萬二千六百〇五元，茲列表於後：</p>
<p>廿八年六月十七日止</p>
<p>銀行名稱　發行數額</p>
<p>中央銀行　三六、五九三、五〇五</p>
<p>中國銀行　一六二、二三三、一〇〇</p>
<p>交通銀行　七八、五〇〇、〇〇</p>
<p>四行　一、五〇〇、〇〇</p>
<p>中國實業　一、七五〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>中國農工　一、五〇〇、〇〇</p>
<p>中國墾業　九〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>浙江興業　二〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>大中銀行　五六、〇〇〇</p>
<p>河北省銀行　五〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>總計　三二二、二四二、六〇五</p>
<p>除中央銀行鈔票三千六百五十九萬三千五百〇五元未印地名外，計印有天津地名鈔票爲二萬九千五百六十四萬九千一百元，內中國交通兩行佔二萬四千餘萬元，現在上海市面，因日前銀行提存風潮以後，各行付出華北及其他各省雜鈔頗多，若即行停止兌換，則一般市民均受相當損失，希望當局在此法幣統一，準備充足之時，最好不分地名，仍舊一律繼續通用，以免法幣信用受到影饗，吾則亦應寬限幾天，一方面登報通告，使一般人民週知，勿再收用，並准限期掉換上海法幣，以免受意外之損失。</p>
<h3>紗花　同業交易大减　棉紗漲後又回　廣帮納胃亦告飽滿</h3>
<p>紗巿始進繼退、局勢寗謐蓋以邇來寢室需發展、華南一帶粗細紗需要繼續不懈、同行互做買進賣出交易、大爲减縮、大概金融收縮、現款籌碼短絀、活動力量、大受掣肘、市價之變動、亦入於常軌也、現銷旺、市盤升、去路滯、行情疲、升降範圍僅在四五元之間徘徊也</p>
<p>現紗晨開巿况無大進出開出稍軟、二十支雙以外棧價爲四百八十七元、港帮進四五十包、棧單價未嘗開出、少頃客帮對於現貨吃胃未衰、人心提起、售價增高、復見徐徐上升、雲南帮粗紗採辦亦興盛、二三支及二一支細紗需要亦不弱、二十支雙馬外棧貨一度做到四百九十一元、棧單價爲四百八十五元半、迨至收盤時、聞廣帮萬興號納胃已飽滿、浮多吐出、立刻又復回挫、廿支雙馬外棧貨收盤價爲四百八十八元、棧單四百八十一元、結果半日成交一千六百四十包、行情二十支雙馬與上日價無甚軒輊、惟二十支五福牧羊比上日價漲二三元之譜、十支粗紗亦堅定、鴻章廠開出十支新寶彝二百包、價爲四百十元、八月份出貨、昨有十八件棉紗自寗波來、今日出口有三百七十包運天津、</p>
<p>香港　七九五雲南三二五　江西　七〇</p>
<p>溫州　二〇同行三九五　內地　三五</p>
<p>統計　一、六四〇</p>
<p>日紗市面、晨初開盤、承上日熱烈之餘氣、續趨前進上漲、二十支月琴紗現出四百元關外、旋以消息不佳及實銷靜寂、又復回挫、迨至收盤價二十支月琴現出爲四百元至三百九十九元之譜、</p>
<h3>現款籌碼愈短　棉花交易更靜</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市因週末之故、頗形疲乏、各方多頭了結反及套賣、致使市價下沉、後又因孟買來電告跌、及南方現貨價格不振、上月二十三日美政府在英簽訂借美棉六十萬之的、茲因各方價形複雜、或有延期執行之說云、結果紐的跌八磅音、印度連同預測跌一羅比、埃及停市、</p>
<p>滬埠外搖交易，自馬電以來、交易日趨困難、昨日叉因本埠近有鉅量華北地名之鈔票、爲防止購買外滙、停止使用、因之法幣籌碼更因缺少、貨到付款更形困難矣、</p>
<p>本棉交易靜寂、一筆生意未曾做開、蓋以貨物　乏、廠方以法幣頭寸短絀、亦無辦意、遂入停頓之途、就目前狀態論之、棉市前途、在此短時問難以發展也、本日僅同業進平果爾二百件、價爲七十五元半、鈔票棧交、蘇北來源亦見凋敝、通花僅到六十三包云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　秋冬布疋　南北現銷漸活　東貨晨漲午跌</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>昨市白貨實銷呆滯如故、偶有售開、價均鬆廉、細布·細斜每疋跌一二角、粗布每疋跌五分至一角、粗斜以貨底尚寡、仍保持原盤、秋冬色布·色斜·絨布、南北各地、現銷漸顯活動、售盤殊形堅挺、南京及津浦隴海沿鐵路各埠、採辦藍布花素直貨、嗶嘰·色丁等貨、昨續有二千餘疋成交、粵港帮辦藍布·色斜·嗶嘰等貨三千餘疋、細布·細斜四百餘疋、川·滇幣添辦色布·花布·花絨·哈其布二千數百疋、蘇北興化口岸泰州等地、辦色布·色斜·印花布·色丁·細布等貨一千五百餘疋、北路天津帮連日出貨、頗顯活潑氣象、惟過去定額、吸納甚巨、暫是祇圖交卸、新交易尚付缺如、本街門市批發號、均祇有散額添配生意、</p>
<p>東疋</p>
<p>晨巿細布·細斜售盤、繼續上挺、漲風甚健十二磅龍頭細布現貨每疋會售開十三元七角半、嗣以外埠鈔票市上忽發生不能流通等消息、滬鈔貼現猛升、木街同業逆意頓呆、市盤復軟、龍頭現出跌至十三元六角、本月份十三元七角、下月期做開十四元、較上週行情每疋尚提升一角、綜細布·細斜成交達一千件之譜、東棉洋行續開十二鎊、花為細布二百包、係由同業字號訂納也、</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>十七日疋頭出口、運天津十四件、十八日運天津六十五件、</p>
<h3>糧食　客銷略動　粉價暗鬆　小麥祇日商採辦</h3>
<p>麵粉　日昨現粉交易、略形活動、除本街及內地帮零批交易外、南北兩帮均有問津之意、惟對於現鈔論價者殊多蹙額、蓋目下現鈔缺乏、滙劃貼現依然高昂、昨市上回範貨祇售四元九角半之滙劃、聞廠盤亦有一部份售開滙劃者、但查本街方面仍須四元六角半之現鈔，故猶未能證實也、統市本客成交共有二萬餘包、仍係零星交易爲主、市面前途、已覺晤鬆之象、出口今日有四千包運大津、</p>
<p>小麥　前昨小麥來源、續有運到、新到各貨、除一部份上棧外、在市求脫者已漸衆多、而目下華廠未辦、日廠需要平淡、轉口帮又鮮問津、故市面殊難好轉、買賣雙方雖經一度擯持、但結果又猛小一角五六分、計開南京麥六元二角半、平湖麥六元二角三分、共成交四百餘包、仍山日商辦去、</p>
<h3>限價减低　中次薄稻反見上漲</h3>
<p>杜粳　昨日米業市塲公告云、案查公共租界及法租界兩當局爲調節民食起見、復經召集本公會代表討論、結果決定繼續抑低米價、自七月十五日起、以前買賣照原有成交價格計算、無論整批零售、最高粳米每石不得超過國幣二十元、最高客尖每石不得超越十六元、中次一律服別、如買賣雙方超越限價者、概不認爲有效、並准隨時據實報告捕房、以憑取締、俾維民食、故昨早市開手人心仍平、形勢又有帶疲之象、惟嗣後忽有本街店胃趁廉動辦、乃市色漸見轉平、結果若各厚粳價呈定局、而薄稻除高料亦乏軒輊外、其中段創透之貨、頗合店胃、一律扳高、故反能回上二三角、杜洋尖埠尖貨稀銷平、市情亦定、全市統計銷去有一萬石左右、各路來源河下及南港帮十四號、車輪包子常州楓涇等地來二千三四百包、</p>
<p>客秈　昨日晨市消滯、中决繼續趨落、旋因更尖動銷回振、而容秈以價盤較低、隨爲店囤注神、後市銷化突吒、人心又復向上、除宿决各米仍被撳小一二角外、高擋反形挺站、南京秈又至十五元六七角、蕪秈十五元四五角、全日成交數四千多包、以本街店囤爲主、內地鄕莊祇揀巧略進、秈米限價最高不得逾十六元、昨已公布實行、</p>
<p>洋米　初開二十一元半、繼至二十一元七角統市開出四百多包、</p>
<p>變元　去路仍稀、而價格似已低盤、故市呈平疲之色、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆再挫二三角</h3>
<p>蠶豆高平次軟</p>
<p>雜糧市况、因受種種環境關係、故市情大半盤居長疲短俏之局、昨市又傳外埠鈔票不能流通、致市塲中賣買交易更見窒礙、銀根日絀、購買力薄弱、故價頻挫、黃豆市再跌二三角、計開大連四平街豆三車、價爲本棧貨九元八角、外棧貨九元七角九元六角半、去路爲內地銷塲、其他本街辦去漢口乍豆四百包、價爲八元七角八元六角半、及浦東杜豆五十餘包、價爲特大粒十一元三角半、中粒十元零三角、普通九元八角、蠶豆稍有心思交易、故市屬高平决辱之勢、昨成交吳江靑皮蠶豆七百餘包、價爲六元零五分至六元、毛家市靑皮蠶豆三百包、價爲六元六角半、送到七元、南翔靑皮蠶豆五十包、價爲六元三角云、</p>
<h3>糖巿　國糖有回小意</h3>
<p>昨糖市據倫敦電訊、近期八月份回升一辦士、爲七先令二辦士半、十二月份小二五、爲六先令二辦七二五、明年三月份不動、本市公會劃盤、趨勢平平、二四粗白仍呌原價、轉口貨二十元八角、成交一百包、太古車白亦少軒輊、Ｂ嘜西棧三十元六角、成交五十包、東棧叫角、DJ嘜二十九元四角半、一百包、荷赤小一二角、現貨二十二元、轉口貨十六元一角、國糖聞汕頭來貨將由日輪輸運、如是則將來不致久斷、故粵閡兩帮、號盤均見喊鬆、蓋邇來去化至稀、行方未敢貪進也、</p>
<h3>絲茶　日絲電告上漲　輯里絲略有做成</h3>
<p>紐約星期無市、橫濱現貨一二五〇元、近期一二二四元、元期一一六〇元、較上週收盤行市計漲起三元至十一元、國外絲銷影響本埠市情、仍甚淡薄、良以某方在歐美兩處賤拋華絲所致、按某方在紐的出售上海白廠七八分、恒較上海洋商出售者低八分至一角、故目前春繭雖已有一部份抵滬、然華絲前途、在戰事勝利之前、似難得到順利發展、</p>
<p>本埠絲巿、上海白廠發電價為二二二〇元、惜未成交、輯里經六號子者信孚等行合進一八〇担、價一二二〇元、堪稱堅挺、印莊有小額土絲交易、價呆定無變、</p>
<h3>進出口　寗波來貨不少</h3>
<p>來滬貨物、昨有桐油一千八百二十五聽、由天津運來、叉由烟臺來豆油八百五十件、寗波來貨較多、計有烟葉十二件、皮油一百二十件、、土紙一千六百九十件云、</p>

<h3>華北地名之鈔票　滬市昨已不通用　防止日僞搬運套取外滙　中交兩行已電總行報告</h3>
<p>中國交通兩銀行、爲防止將天津地名之法幣搬運來滬、套買外匯起見、對天津地名之鈔票、不得不酌予限制、惟少數則仍照常兌換、聞中國·交通·上海兩分行已電告總行並請示、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>天津紙幣發行總數　天津紙幣發行額、至今年六月十七日止、計中國銀行一六二·二三三·一〇〇元、交通銀行七八·五〇〇·〇〇〇元、中央銀行三六·五九二·五〇五元、四行一·五〇〇·〇〇〇、中國實業銀行一·七五〇·〇〇〇元、中國農工銀行一·五〇〇·〇〇〇元、中國墾業銀行九〇·〇〇〇元、浙江興業銀行二〇·〇〇〇元、大中銀行·五六·〇〇〇元、河北省銀行五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、</p>
<p>防止搬運暫予限制　上海市塲、於昨日起、各銀行錢莊對天津地名之鈔票、拒絕收受、同時各商店公司以及烟兌店、對華北地名之鈔票、包括天津·山東·北京·青島·濟南·威海衛·烟台等一律拒絕行使、以致市塲上發生許多謠言、新聲社記者昨特向關係方面探悉、中央銀行及中國農民銀行之法幣、向無地名註明、所以全國一律通用、關於中國·交通·兩銀行之天津地名法幣、茲爲防止搬運套買外匯起見、不得不酌予限制、</p>
<p>少數仍予照常兌換　中國·交通·上海兩分行、對於少數天津地名之法幣、仍予照常兌換、並聞上海天津間之匯水、天津法幣一千三百元、合上海法幣一千元、同時上海黑市之外匯、英滙爲六便士半、而天津之外匯行市僅五便士、所以奸商將天津地名之中交兩行法幣搬運來滬、掉換上海地名之法幣、向外匯黑市套買外匯、此次之酌予限制兌換、旨在防止天津地名之法幣、搬運來滬、</p>
<p>電告總行請示辦法　又聞中國交通兩銀行、除酌予限制兌換外、並已將經過情形、電告總行、並請示辦法、此次之酌予限制、係暫時之措施、與中國整個幣制無關、至於中國法幣之發行、其準備金、現金始終在　百分之六十以上、保證則在百分之四十以下、其現金準備之高、冠於各國、在戰期中法幣之發行、異常謹慎、從未乞　於紙幣政策、業已有事實之證明、毋庸再行贅述、</p>
<p>法幣穩定無庸驚疑　拒收華北地名法幣之風、普及全市後、市民未明真相、不無驚疑、中中交三行上海分行消息、各行對於華北地名之鈔票、如百元中僅有八九元者、仍照常收用、如數目較大、則一律拒用、蓋此種辦法、既非正式拒用、亦非中國法幣另有變動、實爲一種自動制裁奸商行動、至於整個法幣、準備充足、證諸法幣匯率一先令二便士半之法定價格、政府始終維持、即可見一斑、故市民無庸驚擾</p>
<p>滬市流通爲數不多　滬市各業拒用華北地名鈔票後、各界對於此舉、是否將影響金融、不無懷疑、昨據某金融鉅子談、過去滬市各銀行對華北地名鈔票、雖一律通用、但實際上在滬上流通者、爲數不多、市民持有該項鈔票、亦多隨時調換上海地名者、最近市上華北地名鈔票雖增、但大部份爲奸人所有、故拒用之後、對於市民並無損失、整個金融、更無影響可言、</p>
<h3>同行匯劃流通後　檢查擔保數額　劃頭餘額抵作滙劃透支　由各行與各業商酌辦理</h3>
<p>自財政部限制提存後、銀錢兩業爲安定市面輔助工商業、辦理領用同業滙劃、錢準會已開始評價、實施檢查、並公佈同業滙劃及滙劃存款之利率、各行莊爲謀商業上周轉、允以劃頭餘額抵作相等之滙劃透支、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>分別集會　銀行聯合準備委員會辦理各行莊領用同業滙劃後、已聘請專家、組織評價委員會、分房地產股·證券股票股·貨物股、業已由三股主席委員錢新之·貝淞孫·唐齊民·之代表、分別召集各行莊提出之準備財產價格、規定對每一行莊領用同業滙劃、不得逾擔保品評價額百分之七十、如遇市價低落、得隨時追繳擔保品、</p>
<p>實施檢查　市商會·銀行公會·錢業公會·洋商銀行公會·中·中·交·農四行等五團體、各派代表一人、合組上海銀錢業同業滙劃準備檢查委員會後、該委員會準定七月底實施檢查、各行莊領用同業滙劃準備之擔保品種類數額、隨時公告、以昭大信、並已由銀行準備委員會調派人員、襄助處理檢查委員會事務、至於各行莊領用同業滙劃之準備財產、另由保管委員會保管之、</p>
<p>各項利率　銀行聯合準備會通告云、爲訂定七月十七日起、本會各項利率、以後如有變動、再行通告、公單拆息國幣每千元每日二角八分、匯劃每千元每日二角五分、承兌匯票九十日期貼現率國幣二角八分、匯劃二角五分、領用同業匯劃息每千元每日二角一分、同業匯劃存款息、照領用同業匯劃息減除五分、爲每千元每日一角六分、又凡七月四日以前同業向本會所做同業匯劃拆款、其欠息爲每千元每日二角五分、</p>
<p>餘額劃抵　新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、上海五金業同業公會以受財政部馬電限制提存後、該業有無法營運之困難、因建議以存入銀行劃頭餘額、抵作相等之匯劃透支、即以收入之匯劃、隨時歸還匯劃透支、以利商業、經由銀行業公會微詢各行意見、茲聞各行以該項建議、爲謀商業周轉起見、自極周至、惟衹可由各行與該業同業者往來者、自行商酌辦理、較爲簡捷</p>
<h3>江灣各處鄉村　開始反英運動　反英反共竟然並列　發縱指使顯有計畫</h3>
<p>字林報云、江灣多處鄉村、在市中心區青年團之發動下、星期六日蚈始反英大運動、據「新申報」載稱、該團約僅一月前成立、已重新努力、俾「擴大」反英運動之組織、星期六日江灣舉行之大會與流行中、高呼反英口號、散發同樣性質之傳單、攻訐英國與共產份子、最後一口號、意謂上海青年之自治精神、刻在發展中、若輩欲在江灣成立政務署、與現存於浦東等地者相類、示威發表長篇文告、稱英國為「老奸巨猾」、毫無「國際信義」云云、</p>
<h3>漕河涇日軍　挨戶搜查</h3>
<p>據滬西漕河涇來人談、該處日軍、近據報、有大批游擊隊潛入、因之恐慌異常、當於前日會同僞「警」前往鄉區挨戶搜查、嚴加盤詰、當有三客籍男子、均係苦力、因未向「警局」一領取復歸居住證、指爲涉有嫌疑、即被拘捕、押禁日軍部、</p>
<h3>日佛教會僧侶　誘致中國兒童</h3>
<p>日本長畸佛教會僧侶、渡海來華者、實繁有徒、彼輩抵華以後、即分往各淪陷區域、爲戰死於中國之日本兵士祈禱冥福、同時並假借救濟中國貧苦兒童爲名、凡在六歲至十歲之貧苦兒童地、均設法予以收留、教以日語佛經、俟其同化後、即携回日本、以增加其人口、此種工作、京滬滬杭兩綫日軍駐守之處、均有日本僧侶努力進行、各地且已普遍組設「日語佛教聯合會、」誘致中國兒童入瞉、</p>
<h3>宋子文即飛英　鉅額借款將成　宋仍在港已準備赴英　英擬貸中國一千萬鎊</h3>
<p>中國經兩足年抗戰以來、經濟機構鞏固、法幣匯率、始終維持、國際信譽益增、現英美兩國、決繼續予以經濟援助、宋子文有飛英準備、陳光甫留美、中國不久將獲有鉅額借款、整個金融、益臻好轉、茲探誌各情如後、</p>
<p>法幣滙率始終維持　中國實施改革幣制政策後、整個金融、即獲強固基礎、戰事雖延長二年、而法幣六成現金準備、有增無減、一先令二便士半匯率、始終予以維持、最近爲強化外滙管理、對於進出口結滙辦法、雖有變更、但出口商領取滙價差額、進口商繳納平衡費、仍以法定滙價爲計算標準、</p>
<p>外人商業受理匪淺　中國法幣政策、得以順利進行者、雖由於全國金融界協力合作、遵守法令、但英美兩國、對華亦有相當援助、如美國購買中國白銀、對華二千五百萬放款、英國對華貸款、並成立一千萬鎊平準基金、穩定外匯市塲、鞏固法幣基礎、因此外人在遠東經營商業者、無論直接間接、均受到莫大利益、</p>
<p>宋子文氏仍在香港　昨據滬金融界權威方面消息、港電傳中國銀行董事長宋子文氏、由港飛赴英倫敦、任務重大、其目的在聯絡英國金融界、增加對華貸款、加強法幣在國際間信譽、平衡外滙比率云云、但截至昨日下午止、宋氏仍在香港、上海金融界、並未接到宋氏已離港赴英之電報、但悉宋氏曾有赴英準備、何日成行、則尚難逆料、</p>
<p>中國將獲鉅額貸款　去年美國出口銀行貸華之二千五百萬元放款、發展情形、據該行行長比爾遜表示、頗爲滿意、故對華新借款、殊有可能、至於英國對華借款亦在進行中、總額約爲一千萬鎊、該項借款、據一般推測、最近期內、中國繼續獲有英美鉅客新借款、</p>
<h3>日輪駛定</h3>
<p>自日軍於上月先後在沈家門定海登陸後、所有行駛定甬之外輪、均被迫停航、瑞商瑞豐公司之新安利輪、曾一度於本月六日試行復航、但遭日艦攔阻折回、茲悉日方爲霸佔航運權益、已由日商組織「大興公司」及海南公司、派日輪白烏丸揚子江兩輪、定今日下午四時開航定海、兼灣岱山沈家門、但能否達到目的、尚未可必、</p>
<h3>米業實行新限價　聞將繼續抑低　昨晨交易均在新限價以下　議決照前定辦法救濟斛司</h3>
<p>米市塲昨晨開市交易後、管理委員符前耕·天天仇·黃致和·顧益生等、均於上午九時到塲、同時公共租界工部局派中西監視員五名蒞塲實行監督、各項交易均在新限價以下、即最高粳米每石不得超過二十元、最高秈米每石不得超過十六元、如買賣雙方超越限價者、概不認爲有效、並准隨時據實報告捕房、以憑取締、</p>
<h3>首批洋米昨到滬</h3>
<p>自米價飛騰、洋米乘機活動、本市各經營洋米行家、紛向越暹訂辦、茲悉達孚洋行、在西貢訂購之洋米、首批七百噸已起運、裝意輪Cortellazzo號運來、已於昨日下午三時半進口、停靠浦東其昌棧起卸、</p>
<p>豆米公會執監常會　豆米業公會昨日下午三時、舉行執監委員會常會、到委員朱子香·陳子彜·蔡裕焜·邢志剛·符前耕·楊河清等、公推邢志剛爲臨時主席、首由陳子彜報告與公共租界工部局何副總辦、商定抑低米價經過情形、繼由市塲管理主任委員符前耕、報告昨日市塲交易情形、旋即開始討論各案、關於斛司要求救濟案、議決照前定救濟辦法辦理、</p>
<p>當局行將繼續抑低　江浙皖三省新米行將登塲、且有豐收之望、同時上海存米尚稱充足、米價不致再行飛漲、聞公共租界及法租界當局爲維持民食起見、再將會同米業團體、繼續抑低米價、又雜糧商委託達孚洋行向西貢訂購之一號洋米六千包、首批已到埠、</p>
<h3>衛生教育運動　圓滿閉幕　兒童健康比賽評定　檢查情形通知家屬</h3>

<h3>偷得半日閒　集體報告</h3>
<p>二·歡樂與悲哀</p>
<p>在馬路上，大家都要注意到「安全第一」，在兆豐公園中的游客，却無席顧慮到這一點。</p>
<p>你看，那男女老幼，有的手挽手兒駢肩行走；有的牽裾搭臂，且走且向四面顧盼；有的却是些孤獨的游客，形單影隻，在園中兜着圈子；倒也有大丈夫獨往獨來的氣概；不過單人好，成雙的和集團的更好，他們走路的姿態，總是前後參差，快慢不齊。允其是「小天使」們橫穿斜刺，走着方步和正路的，却百不一見呢。</p>
<p>我們幾個人本來的定在池前面，走着一位紳士模樣的男塘之畔相會，所以我一進園門子，年紀的在五十左右，他左之後，就直向池塘進發。在我手提着手杖，右手臂膊下搿着一隻玩具的帆船，的有三尺多長，掛着三角式的大小帆三面。我看到這種情形，便聯想到這帆船的主人。當我正在左右打量的時侯，忽然背後有急促的脚步聲昔，順着風帶來了「爸爸……」的呼聲。天眞，誠摯，愉快，在道「兒子稱呼老子的」最簡單的兩個字中，表現無遺。</p>
<p>是父子二人，他們在我之前，已走到了池塘邊，老的把那玩船緩緩地脫了手，行了個「下水禮，一小的在旁邊拍掌歡呼，十足不扣的又來個「爸爸呀。」在池塘四週兜了個圈子，我在這百分之一縮度的地域中，發現了幾種不同的遊客。譬如，在西北角上臨池的一個低低的小阜上，本來散放着幾張椅子，緊靠着樹蔭底下，早就有一對男女並坐着喁喁情話，我以「漠不關心」的姿態，來窺視他們「情不自禁」的表演，在「一瞥」的時間中，只見那位女性，微挺着上身，背脊並沒有靠着椅背，眼睛直注着她足下的愛河」。坐在她身旁的那位先生，右臂擱在椅背上，對她作虛擬式的半擁抱。他的嘴和她的耳朶，兩者中間祇有一段舌頭的距離。從他倆的神情中看起來，好像這男子是解釋不厭其詳，而那女人却有一搭沒一搭的好像回答，又好像非回答。我雖聽不見她的話，可是身首四肢各部，都充滿了「默片」上無聲的語音。</p>
<p>昨天晌午時分，稍爲有些雨，小雨點之於這對愛侶，好像耳邊之風，他們却毫無動靜。我緩步走着，又看見一個孤獨的外國遊客，頭上戴着冬天的呢帽，上身穿着破舊的藏靑嗶嘰短裝，褲子的顏色，已成爲文字所不能形容的一種，皮鞋因爲久未搽油的緣故，乾枯憔悴，一如六尺之上它主人的面色，同成爲「絕對失意」的表示。這人雖然也經小雨點的打擊，雖然也是毫無動靜地，呆呆坐在椅上，有氣無神地空望着池水；可是我不忍再去窺視他。如果大都市裏的社會學者要編著「窮人的一角」時，我可担保從他的嘴裏，一定可得到很眞實，很豐富的經騐之談。他無疑地是一個呼吸不斷，而還是要求「生存」的一個失業者。（薌師）</p>
<p>竹徑</p>
<p>池塘</p>
<p>三，各異其趣</p>
<p>N君隱沒在樹林深處，留着我和明兒在池畔徘徊，等候的定的朋友。</p>
<p>在風掀起池的波浪，玩具底帆船在滾滾的波浪中起伏，一位年的五十以上的老者，獨自一人在玩着一只較太的帆船，也許因爲船身太輕了些，兩帆高張，失去了重心，行駛很不順利，經不起風浪的侵襲，一下子便翻倒在池中。來了三位洋人，携着開麥拉，向着這艘帆船對光，可是這隻船一再的傾覆水中，終於沒有攝入鏡頭。洋人廢然而去，老者似乎也感覺失望，於是也携了小帆，悵然地消失在池畔。</p>
<p>一位西洋小孩玩着一只較小的帆船，揚帆疾駛，忽而飄忽池中，忽而疾駛彼岸，該孩子忙着在池的兩岸奔跑，這池水和這艘帆船，成了這孩子意識中的光明世界。每年春夏間，上海西人在揚子江上的Yachting，現在只能讓那西洋孩子在這池中專美了。</p>
<p>具有幽默感的S君姗姍而來，由他去找尋N君，我仍携着明兒，在池的右端茅亭下徘徊，明兒見着潔净的石級，專要我陪着跳上跳下來回的走着，她似乎對石級有着特別好感，比方纔西洋孩子的帆船，更感興趣。</p>
<p>沿着池岸走到彼岸，忽然遇見顧兄。而S君也來了。但N君沒有找倒，現在只有綽號「薩拉茜」的嚴兄沒有來。我和S君一方面算是找尋失踪的N君，信步而到了另一池塘，那邊有土坵，並有園外的高房子遮蔽，風似乎小了些。池中荷花盛開，長條魚在碧綠的池水裏游泳，可惜沒有充裕的時間，執竿垂釣，那不是更有逸緻嗎？</p>
<p>穿過小橋，兜過池塘，回到原來的池畔，顧兄仍與他的友人在椅子上把叙闊別。N君也來了，我們便提議要S君拍照。S君先在池畔攝了兩張風景片，大家便提議到新闢的小山上去。</p>
<p>孩子們在廣闊的草坪上玩着小飛機，恰巧天空裏來了一架巨型鐵鳥，孩子們呆着坐倒地上，仰望空中鐵烏，在他小小的意識中，也許他已駕了自己這個飛機玩具，升空追上了這架巨型的鐵鳥了。</p>
<p>一羣少女在音樂臺上疊羅漢，另一位少女架起三脚鏡相在攝影。</p>
<p>靑年男女隱匿在樹木深處的椅子上談情，逛公園顯然是隨各人的年齡和意識思想而各異其趣。</p>
<p>像我們這羣所謂中年以上的人，再要妞妮談情，似乎沒有這種勇氣了，但這並不是說一個人到了中年以上便不再談愛情；不過見了一株樹，一頂橋，幾朶鮮花，茂林修竹，飛鳥游魚，似乎更有興趣。所謂N君忙止住說：「這里鬼氣森「偷得半日閒」，似乎是中年以森，不要進去。」我見了門前上的人都具此同感吧。的兩隻石馬和兩個石人，深深</p>
<p>彎彎曲曲，到了另一個僻地感覺到這環境是那麽不調和靜的處所，走上了只有半環的又在起伏的草地上散步了土坵，新種的竹大都被風吹倒一回，拍了幾張照，意未闌而在地上，兩邊上下石階的角度興未衰，N君猜着要回去。太，配合得很有致，N君便撳開陽隱現在雲端，在風帶着點滴了開麥拉，對着「山路」來一個的雨絲，我們步出了園門。特寫。我們叉信步走到了大樹「偷得半日閒，」逛了兩小蔭庇下呌什麽「兆豐邨」的一所時的公園，寫了一篇「無關抗低矮的舊屋邊，有許多游客在戰」的話，大致還不算是罪過那里用餐。S君想進去看看，吧！（植之）</p>
<p>四，和平與愉快</p>
<p>此園的佈置，相當偉大，全園以樹木爲骨骼，以碎石子路爲筋絡，而以草地爲主體，可謂一望無垠，全是綠色。心理學家謂綠色表示和平與愉快，故遊人入園，一見草地，即覺得神淸氣爽，心平氣和。</p>
<p>都市中人，允其是在上海的人，終日精神緊張，忙於工作，坐電車，乘電梯，進寫字間，一天到晚，忙個不停。所供消遺的，不過是酒食徵逐到大菜館，跳舞塲，電影院，晷刻不暇，更有埋頭一窒，持籌握算，終日苦幹的商人，假使抽暇到這裹草地上去走走，至少心神上的不安，可减少一半。</p>
<p>芭蕉已綠，玫瑰未綻，園西石橋之南，赴動物園小徑，遍植洋繡球，橋北花圃，以草本爲多。曩遊哈爾濱東鐵俱樂部，見昔樂台前碧草如茵，高有數寸以紅色康納沁栽成中東鐵路四字，交織於草之中央，錦繡燦爛，遠望如土耳其名貴地毯，富麗極了，究嫌富貴氣太　，使遊者心理上發生刺激，兆豐花園則異是，乃以淸麗取勝者。</p>
<p>松樹是灌木類，經冬不凋，四季長綠，體積又相當的龐大，公園中栽植，最爲相宜。兆豐公園有針形松，池畔的一顆最可觀，亭亭如蓋，遠望絕類一座玲瓏小寶塔，近看周圍逾丈，針葉平舖，層層而上，倘使你躺在樹下仰望天上的景色，不啻住在白雲深處，忘記了外面的塵囂。</p>
<p>草地西隅的松叢，則爲遊客納凉勝地，西北隅一叢地位較小而密如靑紗幛，靑年男女，往往於此促膝密譚，喁喁情話，我們過此，不由得想到這咫尺桃源之地；正不知成就了多少願作鴛鴦不羨仙的佳侶，更不知有多少靑年在這囊揮却幾許熱情之淚。（長春）</p>

<h3>夫婦間幸福的由來</h3>
<p>夫婦的所以結合，無非是為追求人生的幸福。一個獨居的男子或處女，雖然生活的享用，可以使他們毫不費心；但在他們的內心中每感有寂寞似的缺陷。這種缺陷並不能以金錢或地位來彌補它，必須要以心中的人兒——情人——才能予以滿足，世間有着很多害有相思病的男女，他們因此而致憔悴，消瘦，甚至衰老，但一到他們心中的人兒來到時，她或他的精神和肉體就頓時康復了。我們不要以遠的事實來譬喻，只要看一對因愛情結婚的男女，因為他們的宿願已償，身心上相互的快慰着，人生也發生了新的興趣。在學林與事業上也必然打起精神，同心合力，向前邁進，這是多麽的幸福而有意義呀！</p>
<p>不過事實上也有許多結婚的男女，身心反頽廢了，愛情毫無，陷入人生痛苦的深淵中，這是什麽緣故呢？據醫學上的論斷，大都因男子於早年犯有自凟遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾，把主宰性能健康的生殖腺液（精液）耗消太多，於是新陳代謝作用减退，發育機能停滯，腦，脊髓，性三大神經陷於衰弱狀態，精關鬆弛，則凡滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，發育不全，精薄不育，神經衰弱等症即相繼而起。此種丈夫，在夫婦生活上，每表現着衰弱無能，或竟完全不能人道，這不特犧牲了妻子可貨的靑春，同時自己的內心中亦是如何的悲痛呢？夫婦聞的幸福，在他們猶如輕煙似的幻夢，在幻夢之餘所殘留的不過是猙獰面目的惡魔！</p>
<p>唯一補救辦法，據世界名醫的千萬病案，及余多年經騐，均以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最爲對症特效。因此劑於服後一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，夏令服用，功效與冬天完全相同，繼續服用半月以後，更能助長發育，調整新陳代謝，上述各症必可根本痊愈，惟有遺精者須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」（永安先施西藥部及五洲中法等大藥房均售），以制止遺洩，收效允速！</p>
<p>患者趙興，江寗人，年三十一歲，息早洩陽萎症甚劇，夜眠間有滑精，上月求治於余，余投以大量之「生殖素」幷使與「希米脫氏固精片」兼服，未及一週，滑精即止，至今一月於茲，身體已完全恢復了美滿健康，此眞所謂「事實勝於雄辯」也。</p>
<h3>遺精靑年快快走上自新之路</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>機會決不會等候我們，只有我們去等候機會，若機會錯過了，雖用九牛二虎之力恐亦我不回來，那時的後悔是徒然的！</p>
<p>幼而學，壯而行，在我們的各期生活中均有着特殊而重大的任務。所以凡靑年人必須痛下功夫來奠定我們的學術和事業的基礎，世間學術的浩繫，事業的衆多，就是盡我們畢生的精力，努力以赴，尚恐不及。何况把大好的靑年黃金時代再蹉跎了呢？可是靑年人的覺悟者固然有，不覺悟者也正多着！即如在春情發動期的靑年犯有自凟縱慾者眞不知凡幾？要知自凟縱慾，最易摧殘性神經使精關鬆弛，於是可怕的遺精症即繼之而起。</p>
<p>精液是我們幸福的源泉，也是生命的要素，在生理學上言，精液就是生殖腺液，除貯存於精囊中者係專應愛情的需要，營生殖作用而外，其內分泌素能直接滲於血液，灌溉全身，有調整新陳代謝，助長發育，滋養神經等功能。今若遺精日久而不治，則生殖腺液必告枯竭，則凡發育不全，早洩陽萎，腦衰健忘，神經衰弱，怕寒畏熱等症即相繼而來，此種靑年，不特將爲男女愛情中之罪人，影響於生育，幸福喪盡！同時也錯過了求學機會，年壯而已衰老，亦不過社會上一個頹廢的蠹蟲而已！</p>
<p>唯一補救辦法，即服「希米脫氏固精片」最爲對症特效。因此劑據世界名醫及余多年經騐之證明，服後即能鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，於遺精有藥到病除之功。如因遺精有上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，增益精血，能繼續服用，必可於短期內恢復美滿健康。息者能親來本診所施用電療注射等法，更可保證治愈。</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>多情的女郞必然乳峯高聳</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>與作者曾有一面之雅的美國著名生理學家Samaller聖曼爾博士曾說：『多情的女郎必然乳峯高聳』，起始他這句話，頗引起許多人的懷疑。後來他又著了一篇『乳峯與愛情』刊在某婦女雜誌上，一般人才明瞭他所以說這句話，是根據女性的乳峯發育，完全由於生殖腺卵巢機能的强盛，因爲生殖腺卵巢機能是婦女全部腺器的總樞，它如果能够健全强盛，在體內就產生多量的內分泌，此種內分泌，能促進女性的特徵發達。是以體態方面：最顯著者。便是乳峯高聳，乳頭呈紫檀色，猶如椎形山峯上的塔頂，此外，臀部亦必非常豐腴，身段娘娜，形成健美而多姿的曲線，多麼令人心醉！至於感情方面：亦因新陳代謝作用的旺盛之故，常顯得活潑玲瓏，敏捷多情，此種女郎，因品性與體格的溫柔與健美。所以出外交際，便博得人的同聲讚美，譽爲交際明星。而一旦出嫁以後，又是一位十足典型的賢妻良母，家庭間充滿着喜氣，丈夫尊之若天人，那眞是多麼榮耀而可喜。但過去如曾犯自凟束胸，或月經不調，白帶纏綿，營養不良，重症侵害，致生殖腺卵巢機能失健，影響乳峯發育者。那不但多病多痛，健美喪失，而且還要被男子厭惡，甚至遺棄不顧呢！唯一補救方法，祇有服卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』最爲對症而特效。蓋此劑係由雄壯動物的生殖腺卵巢分泌製成。故服後一日夜間卽能培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖宮止帶，如繼續服用。必可於短期內使乳峯高聳，臀部豐腴，面頰紅潤，靑春長駐。</p>

<p>診時　上午九時至六時止</p>
<h3>淋病突行重發的原因</h3>
<p>許多淋病，往往於不知不覺間成爲表面上已經獲愈之局，而考研其實，决不能説此種淋病已獲完全治愈。且相反的此種現象，並非佳兆。而爲他日再發之根苗，就余多年之實騐，凡是淋病一旦轉入慢性，病家往往以爲治愈。于是妄作胡行，一旦病毒又重暴發，反而不知所措，以爲既未宿娼，何來又有白濁，真所謂丈二和尚，摸不着頭腦也。實際上此等病家，多于初起淋病時，濫服不對症之劣藥，覇藥，引毒入內，或被不良之手術，廹淋菌向內逃竄，因而激發種種續發症，或併發症，其例甚多，如急性淋之白濁，淋菌多叢集於前尿道，其時炎症熾張，局部手術，既無從下手，而內服藥縱使無何種副作用，亦緩不濟急。無補于事。而且遷延時日，化急爲慢，反而適足憤事。</p>
<p>故要求淋病之速愈的秘訣，厥爲勿私服市上成藥，並不可妄就手術平庸，設備落伍，經騐淺薄，及病家之宜攝生。然後用特製自家菌苗，以增加本身之抵抗力，同時並服用化學療法，以及用德國濾淋平流電療法，將匿藏生殖器系統，泌尿器系統及血液中之淋菌，全部而直接予以掃蕩。如此任何淋病，絶對可以限期根治也。</p>

<h3>異哉所謂「中國醫學藝術論」（二）</h3>
<p>— 宋大仁</p>
<p>張先生自己也說：是「一個業餘者」，當然對於中西醫學的搆成，初無深切的認識，却也要參與這種專門學術的討論；即使科學的醫學確有未盡善之處，也抓不着癢處。說上一大篇不着邊際的話，使人看來毫無頭緒，用這種文章要來懷疑科學，獨倡新論，未免太不目量了！</p>
<p>張先生不是說：丁先生的演辭中「如師長不能盡教，弟子們須用優越的天才和能力以自己領悟」，這寥寥數語，不足搆成中國醫學是藝術的論據。不錯；誠然！他又說丁先生演詞中只引了許多古代醫書所載神秘及迷信的套語，——如陰陽，五行，五方，五色，五味，及六氣等等。可是他自已的論據又怎樣呢？哈哈；墮入玄學的魔障了！張先生旣曉得陰陽五行之不可憑，但是他所引證的文字，原是莫不以陰陽五行爲出發的，還要說比陰陽五行的魔術高明萬倍；自己又講上一篇六腑，六官，六氣，六淫，六經，六法的瞎話，我不曉得和丁先生演詞中所引的有什麼兩樣？依我看來：這種套語，張先生却比丁先生引得更多，丁先生推重天才，經騐，果然是認識不够，可是張先生竟變本加厲，不顧一切，大談哲理，豈非笑話！况且丁先生原文末節，還主張將中醫的經騐再加以科學的整理；張先生就不然了，雖然也說什麼「整理爲要」的話，但是根本沒有提到「科學」這兩個字，似乎張先生對於「科學論」，實在有點不願接近的樣子，——也可以說是深惡痛絕——一一定要看「絕對的科學論者」徬徨趦趄起來，才覺有趣！</p>
<p>老實說罷！中國醫學藝術論，是根本不能成立的；所謂「中國醫學」牠的內容，實在是極其雜亂的，有偶合科學的地方，也有極神秘玄虛，極荒唐而不合事實的地方，簡直是一件怪物。你現在假定要想獨創新論，至少要可以代表中醫的全部學術理論，包括無遺，對於每個時代各醫家的思想技術，均能吻合，而不穿鑿附會者，這纔可以成立，在醫史上也可以留一點奇蹟；——不過也祇是歷史上的，與中醫的前途，並無裨益。</p>
<p>醫學楚絕對的實騐科學，不能與音樂，歌舞，書畫，等藝術相提並論的，醫學的對象是「人」，而藝術亦自有「實物「爲其對象；人是有機的，有生命存在的，物是無機的，無生命的，所以不同。我們看藝術的使用，有時可以隨心增損，這裹可以多一點，那裏可以少一點，並不一定；假使創造得好，就說他是有天才，創造得不好，就說沒有天才。醫學可不是如此的，他診斷治病，需要科學，治療疾病，也需要科學，一切都要依據科學的準繩，若憑着各人藝術的手法，去定治療的方針，那就如班孟堅所說的「以瘉為劇，以生為死了！現在讓我來舉一個例，以證明醫學與藝術不同之處：淸代有一個名畫家，姓羅呌兩峯他對於畫是很有天才的，有一决給袁子才——淸代的大詩人與羅同時——了一張肖像，袁子才寫信給他說不曉得是廚下執　之叟，門前賣漿之翁」，嫌他畫的不像，退還了他；可是羅雨峯的藝術天才和價値，並不因此取消，也不會有人根據了這張畫像，把眞的袁子才認做不是袁子才，——是別一個村夫野老，對於袁子才一還是毫無影響，並不會因此而一失去了他的廬山眞面目。醫學是關係人命的，如果同是一個病人，你診斷他說話是痰，別一個中醫又說他是風，病理各異，人家就會感到奇突而懷疑你的大藝術；倘然用藥不當，治療錯誤，害了病人，那末醫生的名譽也就掃地了？所謂中國醫學的藝術應用，即使果如張先生所說話之在時醫俗師的指頭之下，——其實未必如此——可是充其極只是「人」的技巧，而不是「學」的價値；明明是要說中醫學，而偏偏說的是人，（中醫）「神聖工巧，存乎其人」，「何去何從，自能得心應手」，那末我們看古書裏講的華佗，扁鵲，——不管是否實有其事，技術何等神奇，但他們死後，便成絕響，永無後起者，可以繼其絕學，難道這就是所謂藝術的價値嗎？與中國醫學又有什麼關係呢！况且藝術的應用，正是以「絕割貼補爲能事」，無論廣義的技術與狹義的美術，都有這種傾向；可是藝術亦有其實際事物以爲對象，但由於各個人之才智不一，而有高下優劣之差。所以風呀，濕呀，肝陽，陰虛，可以因人而異，隨口亂說，而找不出眞實的對象者，決不可以呌做藝術，如果硬耍給他藝術的冠冕，也不過是中醫的「江湖藝術」而已！有什麽價値呢？</p>
<p>疾病常識</p>
<h3>診斷腸病時的主要徵候</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>腸內息疾病時，診斷上有若干主要徵候，就是（一）疼痛，（二）鼓腸，（三）便通情形，（四）裏急後重等。現在分述在下面：</p>
<p>第一，疼痛；腸管充盈腹腔的大部，而鄰近的臟器又多；所以凡訴腹痛時，先要斷定他是吾因爲腸病而起，抑或由其他臟器而發。例如腎結石，膀胱結石，膽石痛，急性胰腺炎，女子卵巢子宮病等，都有腹內疼痛的症，不可不鑒別的。如果已經知道因爲他種疾病而起的疼痛，更應當注意他是吾限局於一部或是廣泛性的疼痛。但是病人息劇烈的腹痛時，雖是發於一部，但往往訴全腹的疼痛，所以這一點很不容辨別出來，全憑醫者豐富的經騐，纔得斷定。</p>
<p>限局性疼痛時，務須注意他的解剖部位。例如凡臍部周圍小範圍的疼痛，大多從小腸而來。若是育腸炎蚓突炎，肓腸周圍炎等時，疼痛發於右下腹部。十二指腸潰瘍時，疼痛在膽囊的直下。乙字狀部的急性炎時，左下腹部發劇痛。但也須注意腹痛的部位有時並不和病患部相一致。像蚓突炎時，最初並不在右下腹部疼痛而訴胃部或臍部甚至左腹部疼痛的很多。這時候若不細心把手觸診全腹部往往容易忽略而致錯誤。</p>
<p>其次又要注意腹痛是持續性，還是發作性。凡由於器管本質上發的疼痛，都是持續性。若是神經性或因腸管的一部痙攣而來的疼痛，是一時發作性。</p>
<p>再次，要審察食事和大便等的關係。在十二指腸潰瘍時的疼痛，大多在食後三四小時覺劇痛。允其在食取固形食物時爲甚。大腸內疼痛時，往往和大便有關係。在便通前發持續性或一時性疼痛。排便後疼痛全消。其他更須辨別疼痛的性質是急性或慢性，與及和運動，手壓等的關係。像手壓時比放手時腹痛更劇的，大概是腹膜炎之徵；手壓時痛勢减輕的，却是神經性。</p>
<p>第二，鼓腸：鼓腸是腸病時腸內氣體集積而來的微候。生理上因食品的種類而腸內氣體發生有時也有很多的但輕度的鼓腸，是因肝門脈鬱血及血液循環障碍而致腸肉血管吸收氣體的能力减弱而起。又於腸漿液膜炎或腹膜結核或肝硬化症時也見的。高度的鼓腸，大都因腸管壅塞，狹窄或腸麻痺而來。急性的高度鼓腸，普通因便秘而起，或於腸管重疊嵌頓症時見之。慢性的高度鼓腸，除上述情形轉為慢性外，發於慢性腸炎，發酵性腸，消化不良，腸神經症，瘢痕性腸狹窄或腸管痙攣等時。</p>
<p>第三，便通情形：</p>
<p>甲，便秘，有由生活狀况，食物的種類或藥劑而起的。若因腸病而起的急性便秘，恐是腸閉塞或狹窄。此外在慢性胃卡他爾，胃擴張的經過中及腹膜炎腦膜炎時，有起急性便秘的。慢性便秘，見於慢性器質性疾患，像胃陣碍，常習性便秘外，腸的慢性受鄰近臟器的壓迫而起。</p>
<p>乙，泄瀉泄瀉時，先宜注意他是急性或慢性，因數和是吾伴以腹痛。泄瀉，往往因食物或藥品的中毒而來。所以更應查考以前的生活狀况。在傳染性泄瀉流行時，須注意有無遇到傳染的機會。在胃病消化不良而起的泄瀉，要注意發病前胃障碍的是吾存在。</p>
<p>慢性的泄瀉，有神經性泄瀉，卡他爾性泄瀉，慢性腹膜炎，腸結核，肝硬化症等的泄瀉。所以須注意這些病的其他症狀。</p>
<p>第四，裏急後重：裏急後重，多見於痢疾，直腸炎，直腸潰瘍，肛周圍炎，前列腺炎，或痔核等。在婦人又來於子宮或子宮周圍的病變。在小兒，也見於腸重疊症。總之，裏急後重的症候，在大腸深部或其附近有病時發生的。</p>

<h3>治療肺炎之觀察（續廿三期）</h3>
<p>— 顧不問</p>
<p>經過血淸治療後</p>
<p>死亡率减少百分之五十</p>
<p>今在傳染Type1之一二〇〇病案中，用此血淸療法者，其死亡率爲百分之十五，若在非用血淸種簇之療法，則共死亡率，每爲百分之二十五。因此，可以减少百分之四十之死亡數。又在傳染Type　2之七〇〇病案中，其死亡數可以减少至百分之三十七，或百分之三十，是則可以减去百分之十九之死亡率。自從此種血淸治療，問世以後，各種病案中之死亡率，幾可减至百分之五十。</p>
<p>同時另有使用綜合製劑，以資治療肺炎之法，亦經試騐成功，此即一種化學的化台劑之S．U．36，乃有益於多種呼吸器病伴有發熱之傳染病。此劑應行肌肉注射，對於流行性感冒，支氣管炎之症狀，甚具佳果，允以支氣管肺炎，更有特殊功效。而在大葉肺炎之發熱，亦得解除减退，或常自然恢復。此劑之作用，在於增强人體之抵抗力也。</p>
<p>化學治療肺炎，尚有更進一一步之療法，今已發現一種索爾芬萊彌地（Sulfanilamide即柏龍多雪兒Prontosl），對於鏈球菌之傳染病，且有卓越之效果，初於肺炎無甚功效，迨經充分之研究工夫以後，始知內有一種物質，即2-Sulphanily　1-Aminopyridine或稱MandB　693）即大健凰Dagenan），於是發覺其作用，非僅對於鏈球菌有效，且於腦膜球菌，肺炎球菌，亦具同樣之功效·伊文思（Evans）及葛世福（Gaisford）二氏，會以用之於肺炎之治療，竟得充分滿意之佳果，因其體溫降低迅速，而病人之症狀，亦得顯明之好轉也。</p>
<p>不過使用此種藥劑，務宜充分審愼，蓋較索爾芬萊彌地所含之毒素，雖屬尚少，但有各種特殊反應，例如感覺不適，頭痛惡心，貧血等等，故於患者飲食之定量，務須嚴格管理之。允以含有硫黃之食物或瀉藥，更須竭力避免之。此劑顯明之作用，在於消減肺炎球菌之膠囊，係由白血球之暢流，而後可達破壞膠囊之任務也。</p>
<p>旣經使用Mand　B693時，對於例常之胸部敷藥，或調服興奮劑等事，均可不必多此一舉矣。</p>
<p>除非呼吸劇烈困難，則亦罕有用氧者，須至最後呼吸，或認萬難挽救時，始有偶然用氧，以盡人事而已。</p>
<p>倘在病之初期，即行用氣，方有確切之價値，蓋可救濟心力之疲勞，大可順利呼吸也。故在早期用氧者，每可阻止肺充血之增劇，此種肺充血症狀，往往惹起大葉肺炎之併發，甚爲危險，莫可諱言。故早期用氧，在臨牀上，可以增加恢復健康之良機，頗非淺鮮也。</p>

<h3>國際羅浮童軍大會　昨日在英開幕四十二國參加</h3>
<p>（路透十六日倫敦電）四十二國參加之國際羅浮童子軍大會、今日已在潘資沙爾附近之孟齊堡舉行開幕典禮、蘇格蘭事務大臣柯爾維爾致歡迎詞時、宣讀外相哈立法克斯勳爵之來電、謂因公務驅身、未能親臨、殊以爲歡、惟由其在印度所得之經騐、已略知羅浮運動之賈値，並力言比種集會、對於增進各國靑年之諒解及友誼上、有重大關係云、</p>
<h3>全國大學課程概况（下）　課程內容忽視本國材料實際生活　自然科學與社會科學亦不相聯絡</h3>
<p>（二）必修選候科目之不一致同一課目、各校之間、有列為必修者、有列為選修者、舉例言之、十八大學中之生物系、置普通植物學為必修者十三校、列為選修者一校、不設此課者四校、化學系之工業化學、二十五校中、十八校列為必修、三校列為選修、四校不設此課、物理學系之大學、二十校中、列為必修者十八校、列為選修者二校、普通物理、二十大學之物理學系、列為必修者十八校、不設此課者二校、以方程式論為算學系必修者十校、置為選修者五校、不設此課者亦五校、凡此例舉之課目、究竟在各該系中、重要不重要、應修不應修、各校這估價不同如此、</p>
<p>（三）課程之分量各校不同以各課目上課時數而論、亦極不一致、各校算學系之微積分、均為全年學程、而上課時間、有定為每週四小時者、有定為三小時者、有定為五小時者、物理系之近代物理、有定為每週演講三小時、實習三小時、以一年授完者、有定為每週演講三小時、以一年半授完者、有定為每週演講一小時、以兩年授完者、更有定為每週演講三小時、以半年授完者、化學系之定性分析、其上課分量、最少者每週演講二小時、實習九小時、以半年授畢、而最多者以每週演講二小時、實習十二小時、以一年授畢、各校對於課目敎授之分量概無一定標準、其情形如此、</p>
<p>（四）課目設置之年級各有先後</p>
<p>同一課目、各校設置之年期、先後每不盡同、有定為一年級修習者、有定為二年級修習者、甚至有在甲校為一年級必修、而乙校列為三年級或四年級必修者、如中國文學系之文學概論、二十校中、九校列為必修，五校排在一年級、三校排在二年級、一校排在四年級、法律學系之中國法制史、十七校中，六校列爲必修、排在一年級者一校、排在三年級者一校、排在四年級者四校、哲學系之倫理學、七校列為必修、兩校列在一年級、一校列在二年級、兩校列在三年級、一校列為三或四年級一校、不定年級、非僅文法科為然、理學院各系之課程、亦復如此、物學系之植物形態學、二十校中、十二校必修、列在一年級者二校、二年級者七校、三年級者二校、二或三年級者一校、算學系之高等微積分、二十校中、十七校必修、列在二年級者十二校、三年級者四校、四年級者一校、各校課程設置、深淺之無序叉如此、</p>
<p>（五）課目名稱之紛歧</p>
<p>各校之間、課目名稱、性質相類之功課、在甲校爲一名稱、乙校或爲另一名稱、如算學系之方程式論、或稱爲初等方程式、近世幾何、或稱爲近世純粹幾何、化學系之物理化學與理論化學、軍用化學與國防化學、教育系之敎學法與普通敎學法、史學系之史學方法論、與歷史研究法、政治系之比較政府、與歐洲大陸政府等、</p>
<p>（六）同一學校之課目重複</p>
<p>有在一校同系之中、而課目重複僅名稱、稍異者、如化學系中有已設有機化學、同時復設有機化學概論及有機化舉理論者、物理茶中、已設普通物理學、復設物理學大綱、物理學槪要者、算學系已設近世代數學、復設近世代數通論者、亦有同在一校、因學系不同、而設重複科目者、爲法律學系設行政法、由一教授任之、而政治率系設行政總論、以另一教授任之、中國文學系設老子莊子、由一教授任之、而哲學系設老莊哲學、以另一教授任之、重疊繁複、各校多不能免、</p>
<p>（七）偏重專門科目而忽視基本課程</p>
<p>一般現象、皆喜設頗涉專門之課程、以政治學系之同時必修比較文官制度與英美行政制度、社會學系之同時必修中國社會組織、與中國社會問題、以及經濟學系之以商業循環之理論與馬克思經濟學說爲必修、中國文學系之設西人中國音韻學、與甲骨彝鼎文字研究等、大學研究院之功課、往往設立於大學四年課程之內、</p>
<p>上述七點、爲比較各大學各學系課程設置情形而得之現象、若進而論課程之內容、則對於本國材料之忽視、對於實際生活之隔離、及自然科學與社會科學之不相聯絡、各校課程開設之無一致趨向等、亦爲大學課程之一般現象、</p>

<h3>略談老名士</h3>
<p>— 尚卿</p>
<p>我不相信古人說，「痛飲讀離騷，便可稱名士」這句話。因爲這太簡單了，名士之所以爲名士，當然是有着種種原因的。</p>
<p>名士蓄道德，能文章，尚氣節，自然有許多足以使人欽敬的地方。然而名士的使酒負氣，不修邊幅，不事家人生產等習氣，的確也難免使人皺眉頭，不敢向邇。</p>
<p>所謂老名士，我的意思是指着那些年老而又純粹老派的名士說的。不過現在，我不要來評定老名士的價値，或老名士的需要與吾，我只想對我平日耳聞目見的老名士，說幾句話，希望他們在這個事事急劇進步的現代，允其是在這個舉國抗戰的過程中，不至於落得太後，無所貢獻。</p>
<p>我以爲使老名士對於時代落得太後的地方，是他們的迷信。祈夢扶乩，算命占卜等，是他們迷信的行爲，而仙佛鬼神等類，是他們迷信的對象。他們忘記了孔子的「未知生，焉知死」，「未能事人，焉能事鬼」，「敬鬼神而遠之」的「遠」，「祭神如神在」的「如」。照現代科學的解釋，夢和扶乩，都是自騙自的下意識作用，仙佛鬼神，至多只是宗教家想要挽回世道人心的揑造物，嚇嚇婦孺以及愚民的工具。他們也不肯向科學稍稍探訪一下，只一味自騙自，以爲夢有憑，乩有準，鬼神等有靈。他們不但自騙自，更津津樂道之，宣之於口舌，形之於筆墨，矜爲意外的遭遇，獨得的秘密。他們一些沒有想想，他們自己受害多少，更使人受害多少。天下事的處理，世界文明的進步，是可以託之於夢，扶乩等事，求之於鬼神等物的麼？</p>
<p>他們錯過了自我發展的機會，妨礙了世界進展的前程。他們在這點上是不應該的。</p>
<p>和迷信同樣使他們落後的，是他們的封建思想。他們只相信先王之道，不懂孔子還是託古改制的革命家。他們不贊成新的政制，更不想　現代的政治潮流，以及社會理想。他們竭力要保守宗法社會，維持女子必須守節，而男子可以納妾宿娼這一類的陳腐道德。換言之，他們事事想復古，尤其在文學上，他們只以爲文言是好的，文言中的古體詩文，允其是好的，因此自已竭力仿效，呌別人也竭力仿效，不曉得仿效之事，根本不會有成功，更不曉得現在的時世，絕對沒有這項仿效的必要。我這樣說，並不像他們對於新文學一無所知便斥新文學爲無聊那樣，自己對於舊文學一無所知便斥舊文學爲無用。我雖不是三考兩榜，却也曾在這裏面兜過多少圈子，略知一二。我以爲復古是要不得的，提倡古體詩文，允其是要不得的。理由很多，一言以蔽之，還是他們錯過了自我發展的機會，妨礙了世界進展的前程。</p>
<p>他們也許自負上知天文—說不定是星命說的天文，也許自負下知地理—說不定是風水說的地理，却誠如古人批評某種名士的話，中間絕不知人事！他們迷信，他們復古，就是不知人事，換言之，不知世事！爲了人怎可不知人事！處今之世，怎可不知今世之事！他們不要太落後了！</p>
<p>爲了他們這樣落得太後，所以他們對於現在的抗戰，便一無貢獻。當然，他們的氣節此刻可以用得着，大節凛然，絕不靦顏事仇，足以廉頑立懦，然而這是消極的，沒有積極的作爲，仍無濟於事，何况黃秋岳之流，也未嘗不是一時的名士。所以消極的氣節，沒有積極的作爲，便不免有許多的危機在環繞着。</p>
<p>他們在這生死存亡的關頭，如果要保全他們眞名士的價値的，還該打破他們的迷信，丟棄他們的復古思想，而在自己的本位上，爲這大時代也盡一份力！至於怎樣去盡力，我想他們只要有決心，便有辦法，也就用不到我再說什麽了。</p>
<h3>奔</h3>
<p>— 陳詠才</p>
<p>悶人的天氣：沒有太陽，沒有風，沒有雨。</p>
<p>老衍吐口氣。</p>
<p>『老忻！午飯上那兒吃？」</p>
<p>『媽的，有子兒隨便上那兄，沒子兒末還講個什麽！』</p>
<p>『到我家去吃一頓好不好？』</p>
<p>『王八蛋才到你家去！你娘那張臉…」</p>
<p>老忻就是那麽個爽直的條伙。我說：</p>
<p>「喂，你是我朋友，我娘你讓她去好啦！她板着臉，你裝不看見。「我看着他。「飯總要吃的！…來，一起去。」</p>
<p>我去拉他，他突然掙脫了跑到對馬路去。</p>
<p>晚上，天凉了起來，有點風。</p>
<p>老忻在後門口吹口哨。娘說：</p>
<p>「你的呌化子朋友在呌你一起去討飯了！」</p>
<p>我嘟噥着：「呌化朋友有什麽不好？」還白了她一眼。</p>
<p>淡黃色的燈光灑在臉上：老忻更顯得消瘦。</p>
<p>咱們走出了弄口。</p>
<p>『老忻！中午貿點什麼吃？』</p>
<p>『大餅二隻，共計大洋二分正。』</p>
<p>在他的衣襟上粘着一粒黑的東西，我當是臭蟲。</p>
<p>『衣襟上的臭蟲那裏來的？客棧裹臭蟲多麽？』</p>
<p>他把黑的東西塞進口，笑了一下，哈，原來是一粒芝蔴。</p>
<p>馬路上還靜。路樹搖擺着葉子沙沙地響。影子浮動着。頂討厭的是灰砂，撲上臉來　癢的難受。</p>
<p>遠處的路燈，像天上的星星。</p>
<p>『上那兒？』</p>
<p>老忻不響，眼睛注視着地面。他低低地唱起來：</p>
<p>流浪，逃亡；</p>
<p>逃亡，流浪！…</p>
<p>流浪到那年？</p>
<p>逃亡到何方？…</p>
<p>一輛汽車掠過身邊，煤氣，灰塵窒息得透不過氣。</p>
<p>老忻忽然靠着牆，不走了。他喘着。</p>
<p>『媽的，老子走不動了！…眼花…』</p>
<p>扶他，他瞧我一眼。</p>
<p>『怎的？老忻！午飯沒有吃飽？』</p>
<p>他咬一咬嘴唇，又走起來。</p>
<p>「老子沒有錢，當然沒吃飽！今晚借五角大洋來有沒有？五角錢付了今夜的客棧錢，明天還得吃點飯。明天下午我要走了！你想：</p>
<p>我們的祖國已整個在動盪！</p>
<p>我們已無處流浪，</p>
<p>已無處逃亡！…</p>
<p>怎樣？借五角錢來，有沒有？」</p>
<p>我從袋裹摸出幾張角票，給他。他放進袋裏：</p>
<p>『是不是五角？』</p>
<p>『不知道！』</p>
<p>老忻咕嚕着。</p>
<p>『明　你要上那兒，』我忽然想起來問他。『盤費那裹來呢』</p>
<p>『到了明天再講，沒錢把一點破東西賣掉，再借一點來。』</p>
<p>過一會：</p>
<p>『你能不能借點給我？我很對不起你！…』</p>
<p>『好的！明天胸來吧！不過，多不能，五元總可以想法的。』『到了溫州就有辦法了！…』</p>
<p>第二天，上午他沒來，下午還是不見他的影踪。我想他不會來了。</p>
<p>天暗了。斷斷續續地下起雨來，風一陣緊一陣，燈光只迷糊地縮成一團。</p>
<p>，　惚惚　噓—噓！</p>
<p>娘不在家，我探出頭到窗外一張，果然是老忻。</p>
<p>我把五元鈔票遞給老忻後，他忽然不好意思起來。</p>
<p>『我總覺得很對不起…』</p>
<p>『不要多說了。怎麽日裹不來，我等你一天了。』</p>
<p>『媽的，賣東西就賣了一天。好在船今晚才開的！』</p>
<p>雨點一點大了起來，老忻的頭髮濕得粘在一塊。他用手指絞下一點水來，隨手豁掉了。</p>
<p>『到那邊來信！』我找不出話。『噯錢够不够？』</p>
<p>『信說不定！錢還够數！』</p>
<p>他要走了，我拿柄傘給他，因爲雨大了。</p>
<p>他點點頭，撐着傘走向弄口。</p>
<p>忽然，他叉折回來，傘上的雨淅淅地響。他下下傘：</p>
<p>『還給你！』</p>
<p>『怎麽？雨這樣大還…還…』</p>
<p>他放下傘。</p>
<p>『媽的，那撈什子帶着可討厭。老子不怕雨！走！』</p>
<p>老忻一拐一顚的走了。</p>
<p>雨中消失了老忻的背影。</p>

<h3>紅鬼子瓦西卡</h3>
<p>— 高爾基著　狄周譯</p>
<p>姑娘們好像被膠水粘做一團似的擠在門上。默默的聽着阿玖斯尼亞呢喃的聲音，和瓦西卡的呻吟。</p>
<p>麗達站在衆人的前面，很快地把黏在指頭上的紅頭髮拍掉。</p>
<p>『要是死了怎麼辦呢？」誰低低的說，而立刻又沉默起來了……</p>
<p>姑娘們一面儘力不使自己發出聲昔來，一面很留心的離開了瓦西卡的房間。當她們走了之後，地上便顯出各種各樣的破碎的東西和襤　的布塊。</p>
<p>阿玖斯尼亞一個人留在房子裏。</p>
<p>她深深地嘆着氣，走到瓦西卡旁邊，低低的問道；</p>
<p>「喂，你要什麼嗎？」</p>
<p>他睜開脹望着她，什麼也不回答。</p>
<p>『喂，說呀……要水喝嗎？……是，我什麽都可以拿給你……啊……一定是要喝點水了？那末我去拿……』</p>
<p>瓦西卡只默默的搖了搖頭，動了動嘴唇，但是他還是一言不發。</p>
<p>『唉呀，幹嗎——什麽也不會說啦！』阿玖斯尼亞理了理盤在頸上的鬈髪說，『是我們使你痛苦吧……痛嗎，瓦西卡？唉？忍耐忍耐吧，馬上就會治好的，只是開始有點痛罷了，……這我曉得！』</p>
<p>瓦西卡的頭動了動，他以嘶啞的聲音說：</p>
<p>『請……給我一點水……』</p>
<p>他眼裏再沒有那無厭的貪慾的光彩了。</p>
<p>阿玖斯尼亞除了吃飯，喝茶和給病人拿什麽時到樓下外，她都留在樓上瓦西卡的房裏。姊妹們都不和她說話，也不問她。鴇母並不干涉她去伏侍病人，也不呌她去接客。阿玖斯尼亞常常坐在瓦西卡房間的窗子邊，從窗口望着那些被雪封住了的屋頂，因霜變白了的樹枝，和白雲般一股股昇起來的炊烟。看厭了她就靠在那裏的桌子上打盹。晚上她便倒在靠近瓦西卡的床邊的地板上過夜。（十）</p>

<h3>上海設戒酒公所</h3>
<p>上海設立戒酒公所，在英租界工部局後禮拜堂對門。其設立之本意，原爲輪舶水手起見。因伊等上岸，多有赴酒店估酒，及酒酣耳熱，往往生事。自公所成立，則此弊可免。所中室字淸潔，器具華美，並有書籍新報，可以怡悅耳目。或一禮拜一會，或一禮拜再會。會日選備精饌佳餚，異果名糕之類，以爲小宴，以供淸談，特不用酒耳。前禮拜六已經開堂，聚會者爲水手及上海西士二百餘人。鐵公水師提督，於飯後亦來視看，大有庾亮南樓，興復不淺之意。其人伉爽豪邁，水手見之，多伸敬愛。提督亦甚爲誇獎，以其制度之善也。</p>

<h3>上海戰區嬰孩收容所</h3>
<p>— （錫山）</p>
<p>戰前，上海有好幾個育嬰所，收留那些被棄了的萌芽。惟滬戰爆發，這些育嬰所，或因經費關係，或因位於戰區，於是相繼停辦。然初生嬰孩之被棄，却反見加增，且大都來自戰區。在這情形下，中華慈幼協會即設立了一個上海戰區嬰孩收容所，救護戰區內初生以後之無靠嬰孩。該所設立至今，已有二年，原設於貝常路之教堂內，現已遷至大西路惇信路一一六號。記者昨偕中華慈幼協會陳征帆君前往參觀，茲將該所工作實施情况，作一個概略的介紹：</p>
<p>該所位於大西路上，所以四週的環境頗幽靜，進了大門，是一座西式的大住宅，屋前尚有一個花園，空氣很好，這環境的確很能適合孩子們的需要。該所目前的主持人是海密克夫人Mrs．M．J．Helmick。慈幼會每月所供給該所的經費爲一千元，其不足的部份，則由海夫人向友人們捐助。其方法是由捐助者指定認養一個嬰孩，每月担任十四元的認養費，所以在孩子們的搖籃上，時常有一方牌子掛着，寫着認養者的姓名，這就是表示此嬰孩已由某人認養。所內嬰孩之健康工作，由程康佑醫師担任，日常生活由護士及助理管理，護士長爲何秀蓮女士，尚有教師數人，爲教導年齡稍長之孩童。</p>
<p>二十七年度中，該所共收容嬰孩二百二十五名，除安置六十名及死亡七十九名外，現尚存八十六名。在這八十六名嬰孩中，依其年歲的大小，共分成五組：初生至五個月；五個月至十個月；十個月至一歲；一歲至二歲；二歲以上。每組分別由各護士管理。該所房屋共有三層，樓下除一部份爲烘衣窒外，餘均闢作游息之用。二樓則爲嬰孩之臥室，睡具全爲白漆的小鐵牀及籘製之搖籃，各室佈置均極度淸潔，每一陲牀之間隔，亦頗寬暢，光綫及空氣也都能足够需要。三樓爲年齡較長嬰孩之臥室，同時在臥室之外闢課室一間，置有課桌，黑板及玩具等，係供啟發孩童智識之用，由鮑淑芳及陳素芳二位女士担任這部份工作。</p>
<p>該所嬰孩每天生活的程序，規定淸晨六時起身，起身後舉行淸潔檢查及騐體溫。七時半進晨餐。八時洗澡。十時又進食。十一時半至二時爲午睡。三時進食。六時進食。七時入睡。其中年長的兒童另有規定識字的時間及游息的時間。食品方面，各嬰孩亦視其年齡而互異。初生至五個月的嬰孩，完全飼以牛奶粉；五個月至十個月者，則除奶粉外，另飼以麥糊；十個月至一歲者，進食麥糊及豆製的餅；一歲至二歲及二歲以上的，則給以飯食及豆餅之類。衣著方面，大部是自行裁製的，亦有山別處所捐贈的。</p>
<p>這是一個很奇特的現象，該所所收容的嬰孩中，女的要超過男的二倍之上。男的嬰孩目下僅有二十多個，其餘的六十餘名，全是女孩，從這一點上面，很明顯的可表示出社會上對於輕女重男的風氣，依然是很濃厚的。在目前，該所不僅收容戰區的無靠嬰孩，對其他的被棄嬰孩，亦酌情的收容。同時，如果有人欲領養該所的嬰孩，亦殊歡迎。凡欲領養者，可先向該所接洽，並擇選嬰孩，選定後由該所發給請求書並塡具領養人自述表，直接交送中華慈幼協會，經該會調查合格後，便可領養。惟領養後，該會得隨時調查嬰孩被領後之生活情形，如發現不適宜之生活環境時，該會有權將被領之嬰孩領叵。同時，該所對領養人亦有幾點規定：領養人必須有正當之職業，每月進款當在五十元以上，而有能力領養者。領養人當有可靠之保證人，其决領養人將來能吾使養兒人學及給以承繼權等，亦當在領養時述明。但事實上，至該所請求領養者，雖每日均有若干起，但能予合格的，往往很少。</p>
<p>該所自戰後創設以來，經中華慈幼協會與海夫人及各職員等等努力管理，所計劃之各項工作，大部均已實施，且於嬰孩之健康，護養，智力啟發等各方面均積極予以改進，故所獲成績，殊能使人滿意，惟仍深明社會人士，能予以同情之合作。</p>

<h3>失業者注意　又是騙取報名費</h3>
<p>— 浮雲</p>
<p>做茶役要五十元保證金何用　練習生無定額怎能容納得下</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>招聘職員欺詐歛錢的把戲，早已被人拆穿，不料現在還有人在那裏表演，竟然仍有人去上當，雖說半塊錢報名費，數目不大，一個人是有限的，幾百個人，就可觀了！這種欺騙失業者金錢的好狡伎倆，猶如吮失業者身上的血一樣，眞是可惡極了！特將事實，公諸本刋，免失業者上當，事實是這樣的：</p>
<p>前天××報聘請欄內，登着召聘練習生，和茶役一則廣告，書明練習生月薪六元，茶役月薪八元，並沒有指定年歲和資格。一般徬徨終日的失業者，見了不限資格年歲，並沒有何種苛刻條件，認爲是良機不可錯過，於是持報至福州路×××號去碰碰機會。纔鐘鳴十下，已經有一百個人，擠在這間屋內，裏面壁上，貼了一張紙寫的臨時招牌：「××企業社」，有一張大寫字檯，三個西裝革履者，兩個三十左右年歲，一個纔二十外歲，就是臨時的考試者了；兩個坐在寫字檯的兩橫頭，一個站在檯的前面。一個一個失業者，到他們面前去作個別談話，大意是現在本社營業發達，經登報之後，來應微合格取用的，已經不少，茶役只有二名空額，要先繳保證金五十元，練習生是錄取了派往別處工作，（不是外埠，是社務發展，現在談話的屋子，已經不敷應用，別處，就是指將擴充的所在）名額無定，須先繳報名費五角，經審查後函覆，錄取與吾，概不發還，各失業者，對於茶役保證金，大多不能辦到，却是練習生報告費五角，照付的人，倒也不少，留下住址，回家靜候佳音，——這報名費五角，錄取與吾，概不發還，而且不限年齡，不拘資格，這樣來入殼的就多了，說是營業發達，連個搪瓷招牌也沒有，不又是那套把戲嗎？</p>
<h3>女彈詞人物誌</h3>
<p>— 沈宥</p>
<p>若「愛卿」即「　卿」，則可考者，其人爲吳門人，與黃秀卿，黃雲卿爲姊妹，工彈唱，有艷名。至吳素卿，王弢「瀛　雜誌」已說及，「海陬冶遊附錄」亦曾涉及其人。「附錄」云：</p>
<p>吳淞江上洗耳人，集申江彈詞女子二十八人，加以品評，一時傳遍北里，抄襲陽播掿之詞者，幾爲紙貴。不謂鑢　甫更，而滄桑小變，風流雲散，人事推遷。如袁雲仙，吳素卿，姜月卿，朱幼香，徐雅雲，則嫁矣。陳愛卿則他往矣。錢雅卿則化去矣。錢麗卿，唐雲卿，兪翠娥，吳麗琴，則莫知踪跡矣。殊令人撫時感事，而有今昔不同之慨。通來繼起者，又有朱麗卿，色藝雙絕，冠如章台。他如王琴仙，金玉珍，陳昭雲，張翠霞，俱楚楚可憐，足以頡頄諸前輩，洵後來之秀焉。海上多才，殊足爲此中生色矣。</p>
<p>文中所謂洗耳人品評，不知是否即「書仙花榜」。同時，免痴道人也有「摘紅雪詞選題二十四女品花圖」，對素卿，喻之爲「水仙」，爲「雋女」，評云：「皎月湘江捐珮去，淸風洛水弄珠來」。其爲人如何可以見，惜未及其藝。持平叟「接女彈詞小志」曾說到她的書塲生活，但不屬於優勝面。持平叟云：</p>
<p>上海風俗，稱女彈詞爲「先生」，稱彈唱處爲「書塲」，而獻技各奏一回曰「會書」。凡會員不到老不准坐塲。乃會書不到者有四人焉：吳素卿，陳黛香，王麗娟，陳芝香是也。此四人者，　然於塵埃之外矣。</p>
<p>其非一般彈唱女子可知。持平叟所述，除以上諸女彈詞而外，尚有汪秀卿，胡桂芳，稱伊等爲「袁雲仙流亞」。於下列諸人，則並有評述：</p>
<p>唐雲卿，性情眞率，初名薛寶琴，與薛寳蟾爲姊妹行，杭州某司馬爲贖身，後皖人某主政，爲改今名。寶蟾頗肫至。朱靜香未見，或云可與淸談。幼香，其弟子也。朱品蘭，朱素蘭，爲兩姊妹。品蘭微憨，素蘭較點。品蘭鍾情於某，欲嫁，其父母爲鎖閉房中，未幾鬻去。素蘭奏技時，修容太莊，或曰，此貞節坊在額上也。朱素卿，乃其妹。胡麗卿，善媚人，戲呼爲狐狸精，以此三字與其姓名相近也，近已贖身，已爲錢姓矣。雅卿，其妹也。陳愛卿又亞於麗卿，張鳳娟則久嫁，貌中人，而甚深於情。兪翠娥，頗閒靜。其他如施月蘭，爲袁雲仙之妹。陳月貞，爲陳月娥之妹。姜月娟，姜月卿，爲姜月娥之妹。張秀娟爲張鳳娟之妹。胡蘭芳爲胡蘭芳之妹。以及王月琴，吳麗琴，張雲卿諸女士，皆後來之秀也，而余半多未見焉。（九）</p>
<h3>影師艷福</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“Anything　For　A　Thrill”</p>
<p>好萊塢各影業公司對於新聞片的攝製，並不因為是正片的附庸，而敷衍從事的；為了迅速地將世界各地情形，從政治到民間風俗，以及許多偶然發生的事件，傳達到觀衆之前、他們不但在精心設計，而且也互相競爭甚烈的。如最近英皇偕后之美，上海的各電影院（第一輪）都有各公司的新聞片在映着；美國潛水艇失事後的不多時，我們在銀幕上，也看到救護的新聞片了。</p>
<p>攝制新聞片旣然被各公司當局所重視，但任攝製的工作人員，自然也要經過嚴格的甄別，他，至少要有健全的體格，舉動矯捷，還有最主要的條件：機警。「八一三」戰事發生的時候，頗有人想到前方去攝取戰事影片，結果是並無成績，自然，物質條件的不俱備也是一個原因，而沒有這樣的人才，同是不可吾認的事實。</p>
<p>因爲看了「影師艷福」，說了許多廢話。</p>
<p>「影師艷福」的故事貧乏得很，不過寫唐麥洛埃（佛蘭魯達）的機警，勇敢，這是每一個新聞攝影師所應該學取的。</p>
<p>全片的處理，尚不見十分沉悶。唐麥洛埃的偷攝蓓蒂及盜刦新聞片，及最後奸徒到試片圖刦片子的幾塲戲，相當緊張，而叉適合小市民的胃口的。</p>

<p>藝人漫記</p>
<h3>戲校與程腔（上）</h3>
<p>— 冷芳筆錄</p>
<p>……「女硯秋」侯玉蘭小姐口述……</p>
<p>寄萍介紹：侯玉蘭雅號「女硯秋」，唱做兼工，色藝雙佳，爲故都伶界後起坤旦羣之傑出人才。此决隨名鬚生言菊朋南來獻藝，新聲初試，一唱即紅；實至名歸，良非偶然。所擅靑衣，花杉劇，及新排本戲，都凡百齣以上；爲人端莊凝重，樸質無華，允類舊家閩秀，絕無伶人氣息；今年芳齡才十九歲，前途造就，未可限量，泃一極可嘉許之優秀女藝人也。</p>
<p>這番第一次到南方來，自己年紀還輕，閱歷太淺，戲劇知識更懂得不多rn以只知道上台認眞演戲，下台認眞練戲，對於戲劇方面，可說是沒有什麽意見。</p>
<p>我是北平「中華戲曲專科學校」的學生，從十四歲進校起，到去年十八歲，臘月裏，才期滿畢業。戲校修業期限，照例須歷七年，我因爲未進校前，早就有了一些根柢，所以算是揷班生，只經五年就得畢業了。</p>
<p>前幾天來到上海以後，很多關心戲劇事業先生們。都會問起我戲校內部種種情形。我很高興，我很願意詳談我們戲校裏學戲的事情。</p>
<p>我們的戲校，地址在崇門外木廠胡同；是一所很大的廳屋，房舍共有一百多間。現任校長金悔廬先生，是一位學者，戲曲組生旦，净，丑各級說戲的教師，計有近三十位，大都是五六十歲的著名老伶工；其餘教授國，英，算普通課程的教員，也有六七位。學戲的規範大致和科班裹差不多；不過戲校組織是純粹學校化與規律化的，諸如訓育，管理，膳宿等種種方面，一切有條不紊，非常嚴肅。允其在學戲之外，同時兼重普通基本知識的訓練，使每個人都有健全的人格。</p>
<p>每天授課時間，規定上午九時至十二時說戲；下午三時至五時練習武功，腰腿，觔斗，把子。——習文戲者只須學習把子，踢腿。晚問七時至九時，教授國，英，算等普通課程。全校男女生共有一百餘人；教授辦法，是將：靑衣，花旦，鬚生，武生……等各個分班，各設課堂，同時分別上課；唱白專重口授，戲曲書只供參考；學生遇有犯規時，教師僅以罰使面壁爲限，並不如科班裏那樣常要嚴加責扑。</p>
<p>戲校的規例，種秤方面都很嚴格：入學年齡規定在九歲以上，十三歲以下，具有小學畢業程度者爲合格，——但已習戲劇程度甚高者，則自十四歲至十八歲，亦可錄取爲揷班生。入學前試騐及格，須繕具關書，志願書，保證書等三種文契，載明修學年限，不得中途退學，畢業前後應盡演戲義務等各項辦法，照此絕對遵守。入學後學生長年住宿校內，分毫沒有離校外出的自山；即使遇有要事必須回家，亦應由家長的同保證人到校照章塡寫證書，經校方核準，方為有效。因爲，學生除自備衣履外，校方非但不收學費，所有一膳宿書籍費用，也都全部供；所以各項校規訂得極嚴格而是理該絕對服從的。</p>
<h3>侯玉蘭</h3>
<h3>阿Q和張太太</h3>
<p>— 希同</p>
<p>看中法劇社十四晚在辣斐花園預演許幸之所編導的阿Q正傳。有時阿Q或地保由花道即觀衆席間上塲，頗爲新鮮有趣；我差不多近三十年不曾看到這種花樣了。只是在十歲左右，到九畝地舞臺看夏氏弟兄和毛韻珂的新茶花，最後火燒城牆，一隊兵是從台下跨到台上去的。</p>
<p>看過該劇特刊許幸之的自白以後，知道作者寫此劇實已醞釀了十年，可見其對於此劇所下工夫之深。聽說他僅僅　了第二幕開塲吳媽所唱的歌該用什麽調子，就曾徧訪過通俗文藝的喜愛者。從這點不苟的精神來看，他該可以媲美於法國自然主義者之親訪蛇病了。</p>
<p>作者爲了要使劇本的結構緊凑起見，同時也爲了要誇大土豪劣紳的虛僞和罪惡起見，使趙太爺與吳媽通了奸，又讓假洋鬼子勾搭小尼姑，最後又把他們自己的罪名，都加在阿Q身上，雖爲魯迅原著中所無的情節，這處理却是聰明的，更爲戲劇性的。不過旣是爲了結構要緊湊，為什麽還要把「孔乙己」裏的孔乙己和「藥」裏的呌喜故事也放進去呢？我以爲這兩段無關主題的情節，本非阿Q正傳中所有，都可以刪去；不僅因此結構可以更加緊凑，並且可以節省時間和觀衆的疲勞。</p>
<p>在演員方面，王獻齋的地保和徐莘園的趙太爺本是電影界的斵輪老手，富於經騐，自是不凡。王竹友的阿Q和呂吉的吳媽也都演得極好，他如華容楊帆盧山周起洪逗李靑來金明等幾乎無一不佳。惟小尼姑似應與老尼姑一樣，也戴一頂帽子。龍虎鬥的唱句如用紹興調似反不調和，還是現在道樣京味的好，因說白亦均國語也。</p>
<p>十五晚看子夜劇社演吳曉邦所編導的「張太太的夢。」演員阮敏和飛隼是某名作家的子女；我不禁感到光陰之迅速，現在是「說唐小英雄」出世了。此劇純係寓言，木子的希斯和霰的蘇斯林面貌最爲神似。木金生似應穿軍服，外披黑披肩；現在穿了寬袖的黑長杉，頗易與阿拉共相混，因此增加了滑稽的效果，却也未始不是桑榆之收。演到警句時，觀衆爲之屢屢鼓掌，可見此劇是極有意義的。</p>
<p>阿Q是中國民族性弱點的代表，他是不抵抗的；而「張太太的夢」中的强生則是新生的中國的象微，不肯屈服，他要抵抗到底。</p>

<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>旦角所用之長包頭創始於梅巧玲氏</p>
<p>巧玲因爲身體肥碩，當時故有胖巧玲的稱呼，他晚年時本已謝絕歌壇，不常露演，不過他爲慈善心的驅使，每値年終歲尾眼看貧苦同業，無衣無食，實在覺得情景悽慘，因此就每好自動發起一次或兩次窩窩頭會戲，（北平貧寒人家皆吃檸子麵作成的窩窩頭。因價廉也）。並邀請其他名伶參加以所得票價，完全救助貧苦同業。此外他對於窮朋友的搭桌戲或地方公益的義務戲。照例是一槪不予拒絕。所以當時稱道他的人的確不在少數。可是所困難的就是後來他老人家年歲日高，臉上的縐皮和抬頭紋日益加多，而且愈長愈深，以滿面鷄皮的老頭兒再唱花旦，（巧玲是以花旦出名）這未免與純重唱工的靑衣有些不同，而且自個扮起戲來也覺得太瞧不上眼啦。因此他老先生就發明了一種人工補救的辦法，他每逢扮戲的時候，用長的五六尺之黑紗包頭一條，自個對鏡化粧時，命梳頭的夥計，將此包頭拉緊，等他以兩手用力把縐皮和抬頭紋向上推揉的當兒，那個站立身後的夥計，遂將包頭展開，向上提一次，就用紗包頭用力緊纏一次，如是者若干次，直等臉上縐紋全瞧不見啦，方算完畢。試想他那樣大的年紀，還甘願受這般的苦痛，來替貧寒人請命，這種功德着實很不小呢。不常登台的票友，偶以水紗勒頭，有時還昏倒台上，何况是上了歲數的人，又紥纏得如此厲害，那還有不頭暈腦漲的麽。——（六一）——</p>
<h3>「王寳釧」大局已定　女主角仍屬張翠紅</h3>
<p>— 銀翼</p>
<p>薛平貴改造成抗戰英雄</p>
<p>藝華影業公司積極攝製「王寶釧」古裝片，屬於薛平貴與代戰公主部份戲差不多將告結束，薛平貴由李英飾，代戰公主一角一度引起在洋與古寒之爭，結果是改歸貂斑華担任，貂斑華拍了不少「戎裝佩劍」的呆照，英武氣概不下於「木蘭從軍」中的陳雲裳。</p>
<p>女主角王寶釧，藝華當局自始就屬意於「古典派美人」張翠紅，後來因爲張翠紅的「外子」，不願他這位太太再上銀幕，對藝華有「堅決拒絕」的表示，於是藝華不得不另想別法，曾由藝華小主人嚴幼祥親自遄赴香港，預備請南國首席紅影星李綺年到上海來，但未能如願，嚴幼祥回滬後，仍與張翠紅磋商，張翠紅和她的「外子」鑒於藝華當局這樣的情殷，倒也覺得有點不好意思起來，這纔接受了藝華的挽請，現在，王寶釧一角總算是決定了</p>
<p>在暴風雨襲擊上海的那天，藝華攝影塲上武家坡佈景被大風刮了去，因此拍戲工作停頓了兩天，後來又經重行搭製，這一幕戲現在已告完成。據吳村表示：在銀慕上的薛平貴，將完全成爲一個抗戰英雄，與舞台上「紅鬃烈馬」裹的薛平貴，截然不同。這樣，外間對於「王寶釧」搬上銀幕的疑慮可以消釋了。</p>

<h3>Chamberlain's Statement in the House of Commons: No Change in British Far East Policy; Japan Only Hopes for Understanding of Its Difficulties and Claims; All Principles of the Nine-Power Treaty Remain Unaffected; It Remains Difficult to Predict When Formal Negotiations Will Begin</h3>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain issued a statement on the Far East situation, saying, "Various reports in the Japanese and our countries' newspapers recently claimed that the Japanese government would demand that our country fundamentally change its Far East policy as a condition for starting negotiations. I hereby clearly state that our country's foreign policy has its own considerations and will not accept demands from other countries, nor will it be convenient to accept demands from other countries and change it. (Members cheered loudly.) Moreover, I declare that we have not received such a request from the Japanese government. According to Sir Robert Craigie, our ambassador to Japan, Japan's official position is more accurately outlined as follows: that country hopes that the United Kingdom will, in its observations of the Sino-Japanese war, give due understanding to Japan's difficulties and claims. If we were to hastily assume that the Japanese government has a certain intention, such an assumption, not necessarily accurate, would only affect negotiations and hinder their success. The government also agrees with Ambassador Craigie's view. As for when formal negotiations can begin, it is still difficult to predict. According to announcements from Tokyo, Ambassador Craigie had a friendly discussion with Foreign Minister Arita at the Japanese Foreign Ministry on the 15th of this month regarding the general background of the Tianjin situation and decided to postpone the talks to allow both parties to carefully consider the various issues involved. As for the Tianjin situation, it has generally improved, with sufficient food being transported into the concessions, and the milk supply is also sufficient. In addition, anti-British demonstrations have occurred in certain places in North China, and British church property in Shanxi Province has suffered minor damage. Furthermore, in Shantou, the Japanese authorities have issued a formal notice stating that ships of all countries, provided they do not interfere with military operations, may be allowed to enter Shantou Port under certain conditions, but limited to one ship per week. Regarding this matter, the British and Japanese authorities are currently conducting negotiations. In Fuzhou, a small number of British expatriates have already withdrawn." At this point, the Prime Minister addressed the arrest of Lieutenant Colonel Spear, the military attaché of the British Embassy in China, saying, "The Japanese government has notified Ambassador Craigie that Lieutenant Colonel Spear has almost certainly been interrogated, and the Japanese government will continue to investigate. Ambassador Craigie, dissatisfied with this procedure, made the strongest representations to the Japanese government and requested that a British officer who speaks Japanese be allowed to go to Zhangjiakou." Sir Archibald Sinclair, leader of the opposition Liberal Party, immediately asked, "Lieutenant Colonel Spear should enjoy diplomatic privileges. Does the Prime Minister's statement about sending a Japanese-speaking officer to Zhangjiakou to contact Lieutenant Colonel Spear mean that the government no longer demands that Japan release him immediately?" Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "Absolutely not. I said that the British Embassy in Japan has made the strongest representations to the Japanese government, demanding the release of Lieutenant Colonel Spear." (Havas News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Labour MP Henderson asked if the Prime Minister meant that the Tokyo negotiations would be limited to the Tianjin incident and that the British government would not endorse any amendment to the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty that deviated from the United States and other governments. The Prime Minister replied that that was indeed what he meant and that he had already stated that the government had not received any such request from the Japanese government. Labour MP Noel-Baker suggested that the British government should inform the Japanese government that Japan's invasion of China was an act of aggression condemned by the League of Nations and a crime against humanity, and that if it could be stopped, all outstanding issues between Britain and Japan could be resolved. The Prime Minister declared in response to a supplementary question that he did not think this suggestion was very helpful.</p>
<p>Labour MP Sorensen then asked whether atrocities had occurred in other parts of the fallen areas of China. The Prime Minister replied that he believed such atrocities mostly occurred in cities occupied by the Japanese army, and he had not heard of such incidents in other areas. Labour MP Thurtle also asked about the demonstrations outside the British Embassy in Tokyo. The Prime Minister replied that, to his knowledge, a large number of Japanese people had paraded and demonstrated in front of the British Embassy, causing police intervention, and he believed that everything was now calm there. Labour MP Fry asked whether there had been any further atrocities against British expatriates in the Tianjin area since the Prime Minister declared that the cessation of these atrocities was one of the conditions for negotiations with Japan. The Prime Minister replied that he had seen a report stating that the Japanese side had continued to impose some restrictions on the entry and exit of British expatriates into the concession, and he did not think these restrictions were commensurate with the atrocities previously complained of by the British government. Former Foreign Secretary Eden asked whether the Japanese government had not requested that the scope of the issues be expanded beyond the Tianjin incident, which he had learned. The Prime Minister replied that he had not said this. Sir Robert Craigie's conversation with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita had largely agreed on the outlines that the Japanese government believed should be followed in considering the Tianjin incident, but the Japanese government had not suggested that the discussion or resolution of general issues should be a condition for negotiations. Liberal Party leader Sinclair then asked if the British government had abandoned the demand for the immediate release of Mr. Spear, now that it had sent a Japanese-speaking officer to contact him, as Mr. Spear was entitled to diplomatic immunity. The Prime Minister replied in the negative, stating that it had certainly not been abandoned and that Sir Robert Craigie had made very strong representations to the Japanese government, demanding the release of Mr. Spear, as he had already said.

<h3>No Change in Tianjin Situation; Anti-British Tide Grows in Various Places</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources from Tianjin received here today, no unexpected incidents have occurred in Tianjin. The Japanese authorities are quite confident in controlling the situation, but there have been several anti-British incidents in other parts of North China. The Chinese authorities in Kaifeng have demanded that British expatriates withdraw within a specified period. At the same time, a British soldier in Shanhaiguan was shot and attacked by a Chinese person. The anti-British sentiment among the Chinese masses is growing daily, and anti-British riots have intensified since the Tianjin case. According to Japanese sources in Harbin, Japanese expatriates there held an anti-British mass rally today, during which some people delivered passionate speeches, shouting the slogan "Down with Britain!" According to Japanese sources in Hankou, the Wuhan Press Association has sent a telegram to Prime Minister Hiranuma, Navy Minister Yonai, Army Minister Itagaki, and other military leaders, declaring that the association aims to eliminate British influence in China and is willing to support the anti-British policies implemented by the Japanese authorities. According to sources in Jinan, the "Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government" and the "Mayor of Jinan" both sent telegrams to the Japanese government and the Japanese Army diplomatic authorities in Tianjin today, asking them to do their best to carry out national policy and punish Britain for obstructing the establishment of the new order in East Asia. Workers at a coal mine in Xinxiang, Henan Province, also held a meeting and passed a resolution urging the Japanese government to exclude British interests in the Far East. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Spear Has Not Yet Been Formally Tried</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to a spokesman for the Japanese army here, Mr. Spear, the military attaché of the British Embassy, has not yet been formally interrogated by a military court. Although the Japanese side has questioned Mr. Spear once, the purpose was purely to investigate whether Mr. Spear's actions were detrimental to the Japanese side, and whether Mr. Spear was acting in the capacity of a British military attaché when he was arrested on May 26. As for whether the military court will conduct a public trial of Mr. Spear or only conduct a secret interrogation, the spokesman believed it was inconvenient to disclose.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The North China Banknote Problem</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, the issuance has been centralized, the reserves have been centralized, banknotes no longer have bank distinctions or regional divisions, the foundation is stable, the credit is outstanding, the area is unified, and circulation is convenient. In mid-March of last year, due to the promotion of "Joint Banknotes" in the north, there was an attempt to collect and eliminate banknotes from various banks in North China in one fell swoop; the news came south, and progress was slightly hindered, but the banking authorities repeatedly stated that they would not destroy the credit of the entire legal tender due to local influences, and advised the people to continue to use it as usual, so the people were at ease. Recently, however, rumors have arisen in the market, and merchants and civilians, confused by the rumors, inevitably choose between banknotes of various colors, thus discussing banks and locations, with the intention of suppression and promotion. The impact of this has been described as "miscellaneous banknotes"; however, due to the rumors being unfavorable to miscellaneous banknotes, the number of miscellaneous banknotes has only increased, but they are still used as before. However, yesterday, bad news suddenly arrived, saying that various banks are refusing to accept banknotes with North China place names; the matter came suddenly, and holders either tried to use them without success, and spread the word, causing panic in the market, which is truly a noteworthy phenomenon.</p>
<p>The reasons for the North China banknote problem are said to be very diverse, but briefly: (1) It is said to be related to remittances. Since the same legal tender, the legal tender issued in North China is often lower in value than in Shanghai due to special circumstances; at the lowest point, about 130 North China legal tender dollars could be exchanged for 100 Shanghai legal tender dollars, in other words, North China place-name legal tender, converted into Shanghai legal tender, is only worth seventy-odd cents. In addition, recently, due to the impact of the Tianjin concession blockade, people are panic-stricken, and foreign exchange is incredibly expensive; for example, the lowest British exchange rate in Tianjin was 4.75 pence; if Tianjin releases foreign exchange and receives legal tender, and then settles foreign exchange in Shanghai, such a transfer would be very profitable, but this can only be done by those with special influence. Therefore, there is a saying that a certain party brought 40 million yuan of North China banknotes to Shanghai to buy foreign exchange; the absorption of spot foreign exchange and the throwing of forward exchange certainly exists, but the Sino-Japanese Tianjin banknotes seen in the market did not start recently, and it is said that foreign merchant banks are extremely strict in checking and accepting legal tender for foreign exchange transactions, and even non-uniform banknotes must be discounted separately, so even if a large number of North China banknotes are shipped to Shanghai, as long as Chinese merchant banks pay attention, what is there to fear about the possibility of collapse? (2) It is said to be related to silver reserves. From the beginning of the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin concession, they threatened to obtain more than 50 million yuan of Tianjin silver reserves and regarded it as one of the conditions for Anglo-Japanese negotiations. The Anglo-Japanese negotiations are still in their infancy; the British have vowed to maintain Chinese legal tender and will never take actions that would destroy the credit of Chinese legal tender; if the silver reserves are handed over to the Japanese to resolve the Tianjin case, we can believe that the British will definitely not do this. Moreover, legal tender reserves are centralized, and Tianjin silver reserves are not the reserves for North China banknotes; Tianjin silver has certainly not been allowed to be seized, and even if it were, what would it have to do with North China banknotes? Therefore, this saying is also unbelievable. (3) It is said to be related to sabotage. It is meant that the government has not made any indication, and only some banks are refusing to use it; this is a violation of legal tender orders, suppressing the common people who hold banknotes, and merely seeking to profit from the suppression and promotion of the banknotes. As for this saying, we are also concerned about the lack of real evidence, and we secretly suspect that the strength of some banks is insufficient to remedy the evil, or they have rashly done this, and the loss of conscience is extreme!</p>
<p>There are three kinds of rumors about the reasons for the refusal to use North China banknotes, and there is no consensus, or perhaps none of them are true; in short, it is still difficult to understand. The scope of the refusal may be all areas outside North China, or limited to Shanghai, or only some banks and exchange shops in Shanghai, which remains to be proven by facts. The nature of the refusal may be a temporary blockage, or a whole plan, or a conspiracy to destroy legal tender, or a hardship to preserve legal tender; these are very different, and without investigation, there is no way to diagnose. We secretly believe that the financial authorities of the National Government should do something about this issue, whether it is a positive explanation, a side indication, rigorous implementation, or correction; it must be one of them, and cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>We still want to say something about this phenomenon: (1) Since these banknotes have been rejected, they cannot be forced to be used; therefore, destruction is certainly unnecessary, and hastily devaluing them to seek disposal is also not the right way to proceed; saying that seeking disposal and suffering a great loss is still a minor matter. It is better to keep them and wait for instructions from the financial authorities. (2) In such a situation, the most important thing is for the public to remain calm, endure the pain, and abide by the rules; this is an important belief for reducing national and ethnic difficulties and reducing unnecessary personal losses, and it should not only be the case when disposing of North China banknotes. The impact of the non-circulation of North China banknotes, in North China, on the one hand, almost helps to promote the so-called "Joint Banknotes," and on the other hand, it also alleviates the effect of squeezing North China banknotes; in Shanghai, on the one hand, it causes losses to merchants and civilians holding North China banknotes, and on the other hand, it also makes it impossible for those who bundle North China banknotes to come south to easily obtain general banknotes and foreign exchange. It should be known that the so-called North China banknotes also have a considerable amount in Shanghai, but they are mostly collected and distributed in North China; the separation between the two places often makes the source unclear; normal merchants and civilians who hold large amounts of North China banknotes may exist, but it is still an exception. In everything, benefits and disadvantages go hand in hand, and gains and losses must be weighed; therefore, on this day when the financial authorities have not yet given instructions, the best plan is to wait quietly for instructions.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Japanese Opinions Differ; Second Talk Postponed; London Studies Craigie Report, Both Sides' Newspapers View Task Pessimistically</h3>
<p>(London) London has received the report of the initial meeting between the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, and is currently considering it. Reuters has learned that the date of the next meeting has not yet been determined. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The second meeting between Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, which was originally scheduled for this afternoon, has been postponed to Wednesday. It is said that this is due to the late arrival of instructions from the British government to the British Ambassador. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) A Reuters diplomatic correspondent has learned that the British government is currently considering the report of Ambassador Craigie to Japan regarding the Tianjin incident and his meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. Until the British government notifies Craigie of its opinion, the meeting between Craigie and Arita is unlikely to continue. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) This morning, all newspapers published the "verbal exchange" between Britain and Japan in Tokyo on Saturday on their front pages. The newspapers are now closely watching for signals of a full debate. News Chronicle diplomatic correspondent Bartlett (MP) called the first meeting between British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita "a long and inconclusive meeting," and said that if the Japanese side insisted (as expected) on the demand that Britain "cooperate" with Japan's "new policy" in China, the British government would likely submit this issue to the United States, France, and other signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty for their opinions. The Daily Telegraph published an editorial acknowledging that the progress of Saturday's meeting has not yet revealed details, but stated that it would not be surprising if it revealed that the two sides had widely divergent opinions on the scope of the talks. If the Japanese side insisted on its attitude, the hope of obtaining good results from this meeting would be slim. The newspaper strongly argued that there was no room for compromise on the true purpose behind the Japanese actions in Tianjin, and that the Japanese anti-British movement's claim that "Japan can complete its conquest of China sooner without British aid" was clearly absurd. The Times said that the Tokyo meeting was unlikely to make much progress until the British government had had sufficient time to consider the information presented by Sir Robert Craigie. If the Japanese interpretation of the attitude of the Japanese army foreshadowed a Japanese attempt to expand the scope of negotiations beyond the Tianjin dispute, the meeting would be unlikely to produce any results and would be deadlocked. The newspaper also discussed other forms of pressure that the Japanese army would impose on the British after the failure of the negotiations, such as anti-British riots by submissive Chinese, saying that if the Japanese side did this, it would not only endanger the British expatriates in Tianjin, but also for various reasons, give the United States the full benefit of a very friendly neutrality to China. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is becoming increasingly clear that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita is urging British Ambassador Craigie to discuss general issues concerning China before dealing with the Tianjin incident. The statement published in the Japanese newspapers that Craigie has expressed his willingness to do so is not credible, but Ambassador Craigie will of course have to listen to Arita's views on the general principles that form the background to the current situation in Tianjin. Asahi Shimbun said that there are quite a few gaps between the British and Japanese sides, and it will be necessary to hold several more meetings before a basic understanding can be reached on this issue and the principles involved. Whether the Anglo-Japanese talks can succeed will be clear by the end of this week. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun said that the outcome of the talks is not optimistic. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>Fierce Anti-British Movement Underway in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) Although the Guangzhou authorities have banned various anti-British actions, a fierce anti-British movement is currently underway. The method is to use Chinese newspapers, leaflets, and pamphlets. Previously, this movement was of a mild nature and was aimed solely at Hong Kong, as evidenced by the Chinese newspapers' claim that the new Chinese government will return the Kowloon leased territory to China by the end of this year. However, in the past few days, anti-British propaganda has become widespread, and anti-British leaflets have been found all over the city. One of them depicts Indians such as Gandhi kneeling before British soldiers, with the title "British Imperialism in India." Pamphlets are distributed everywhere, with slogans such as "Resist with arms to eliminate white imperialism" and "China should recognize British imperialism as its enemy."

<h3>Japanese Claim Soviet Planes Attacked Manchurian Border; Eight Planes Bombed Station Twice, Four Passenger Cars Destroyed, Post Office Caught Fire</h3>
<p>(Shenyang) There was again activity by both sides' air forces on the Soviet-Mongolian border today. Soviet planes bombed a railway center near Angangxi, the most important railway terminus east of Hailar. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, eight Soviet-Mongolian S.B. bombers bombed Fularji, a junction of international railways inside Manchuria, and at 6:45 last night attacked Haranahier (transliteration), 140 kilometers inside the "Manchukuo" border, dropping dozens of bombs, injuring four civilians, destroying four passenger cars parked outside the station, and causing a fire in the area post office, which was extinguished immediately with no major damage. The glass windows of many residences were shattered by the bombs. Today, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Army claimed that the bombing of Fularji and Haranahier Mountain by Soviet-Mongolian planes was particularly important because it crossed the border deep into Manchuria. He meant that the Soviet action was to "wash away the shame of the defeat at Nomonhan." Judging from the internal situation in the Soviet Union, he did not believe that the Soviet Union intended to engage in a full-scale war. When a certain foreign visitor asked if the attack on Fularji was by Mongolian or Soviet planes, the spokesman replied that he could not be sure. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Soong Tzu-wen Rumored to Still be in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Although Chinese newspapers have reported that Mr. Soong Tzu-wen, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, has gone to London on a government economic mission, Mr. Soong is still in Hong Kong. He met with a reporter from a London newspaper last weekend and did not mention any intention of going to London. Although there are rumors that Mr. Soong may leave Hong Kong in the next few days, there is no detailed information. According to the Chinese newspaper report, Mr. Soong will meet with financial circles in London to find ways to impose economic sanctions on Japan and strengthen the position of the Chinese legal tender.

Dr. Norris is well-versed in politics, has unique insights into international issues, and has a deep friendship with Secretary of State Hull." (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Control Implemented in Beiping</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The new foreign exchange control plan announced by the Beiping "Provisional Government" came into effect today. It is heard that British merchants do not intend to conduct business in accordance with the methods announced by the "Provisional Government," but merchants from small countries and some German merchants have contacted the Yokohama Specie Bank, which is operating in the Japanese concession, to handle export drafts. According to the new regulations, exporters of various goods, except for seven unimportant goods, must present proof of their goods being transported abroad to sell foreign exchange at a price of 14 pence, and goods being transported to Japan and "Manchuria" must sell Japanese exchange at an equal price. It is generally believed that this move is another blow to foreign trade in North China. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Rumors of Kung Hsiang-hsi's Resignation Completely Groundless</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The rumors circulating in Shanghai that Dr. Kung Hsiang-hsi, the President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of China, is about to resign are considered by official sources here to be completely groundless. Similar rumors spread at this time last year, but the facts have proven them to be inaccurate. According to those familiar with the matter, these rumors must have been created by speculators, and their intention is to depress the exchange rate of Chinese legal tender. (Associated Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants on Sakhalin Punished by Soviets; 374,000 Rubles: Togo Protests to Soviets</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Japanese Sakhalin Coal Mining Company was fined 374,000 rubles by the island's primary court for violating its contract with the Soviet trade union. Later, it appealed to the higher court of the city of Aleksandrovsk, which upheld the original judgment. The Soviet side also ordered the company to pay the fine in full by the 19th of this month, otherwise its property would be confiscated. Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo Shigenori visited Vice-Chairman Rossovsky of the Foreign Affairs People's Committee yesterday to protest, saying that the Japanese government would safeguard the interests of its people with a firm attitude. In addition to the coal mining company directly requesting the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet to revoke the original judgment, it also hoped that the Soviet government would give the Japanese government a reply by the 18th of this month. Rossovsky immediately refused to accept this time limit, but said that the Soviet government would provide a reply when possible. At the same time, representatives of the coal mining company and Soviet miners are negotiating in Moscow to establish a new contract to replace the old contract that expired in December of last year. It is reported that some progress has been made. The Soviet workers' representatives had previously demanded a 40% pay increase since December of last year, but have now accepted a 15% pay increase, but some minor issues remain to be discussed, such as the validity period of the new contract. The Soviet workers' representatives argued that it should be set at one year, starting from December of last year, while the coal mining company argued that since the company has not employed Soviet workers since December of last year, it should start from now and last for one year. There is a dispute between the two sides, and no agreement has been reached. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A certain foreign reporter asked at a press conference held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today whether the protest lodged by Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo against the Soviet Union's oppression of Japanese who have oil and coal concession rights on North Sakhalin was intended as a warning rather than a protest. The spokesman replied that whether this action should be regarded as a protest or a warning depends entirely on the Soviet Union's mentality. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>Chongqing United Daily News Comments on Tokyo Conference: Anglo-Japanese Relations Worth Noting But Unrelated to the National Policy of Resistance</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Today's editorial in the Chongqing United Daily News, titled "The Anglo-Japanese Conference and China," stated that our nation's final victory in the war of resistance depends on our efforts and sacrifices, not on any changes in the relationship between a third country and our enemy. Before receiving concrete reports, we should not speculate on the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo. What is obvious is that Japan wants to use this opportunity to completely eliminate British influence in the Far East. Since the outcome of the conference is related to China, China cannot remain indifferent. Will Britain and Japan reach a private compromise in this conference, or will the conference fail and Anglo-Japanese relations worsen? Although the stated purpose of the conference is to resolve the Tianjin Incident, in reality, Japan wants to use this to seize what Britain has painstakingly built up over forty years. Japan believes that Britain must compromise on a temporary peace. However, Britain's policy of compromise should not be interpreted as a sign of weakness. Britain's patience is limited, and Japan's violence against the British and its infringement of British interests have far exceeded this limit and scope. Based on common understanding, if Britain refuses to compromise with Japan, the Tokyo conference is unlikely to produce concrete results. The failure of the Tokyo conference will lead to Japan's continued aggression, further worsening Anglo-Japanese relations, and at the same time, promoting greater sympathy and assistance from Britain to China. Even if Britain is forced to adopt a temporary compromise policy towards Japan for some reason, our long-term unified front and the national policy of achieving final victory can also be achieved through our own firm efforts and sacrifices, and will not be affected by changes in the policies of third countries towards the enemy. Our diplomatic policy is to gain more friendly countries, create fewer enemies, to cultivate friendship with righteousness, and to awaken the attention of countries with vested interests.

<p>A certain place in northern Hunan: After General Guan Linzheng accepted the banner of "High Achievements in a Hundred Battles" presented by the Southern Route Comfort Delegation, he told our reporter that since the Chinese and Japanese armies became entangled in the southeastern area of Yueyang last year, the Japanese army had launched five decisive attacks on the Chinese army, but not only had they failed to cross the Xinqiang River by even one step, but it was also impossible to shake the Chinese side's forward strongholds on both sides of the Xinqiang River. Among them, the Japanese army suffered the greatest losses and casualties in the battle of Gangkou in the fourth decisive attack, expending more than a thousand shells and leaving more than a thousand bodies behind, but Gangkou remained unscathed. According to my personal battlefield experience, the morale and tactics of the Japanese army in northern Hunan are now far less brave and stubborn than they were during the fierce battle of Taierzhuang.

<h3>US Senator Issues Declaration in Response to Roosevelt's Proposal: Urges Congress to Pass a Bill to Prevent Munitions Aid to Japanese Aggression</h3>
<p>(Washington) A faction in the US Congress advocating for the re-discussion and amendment of the Neutrality Act during this session of Congress issued a declaration yesterday after a meeting at the Mayflower Hotel, stating that the most important issue for the United States at present is how to amend the current Neutrality Act, which is not neutral in fact, and abolish the clause prohibiting munitions to belligerent countries, and then prevent Japan's war of aggression against the Chinese people. If this clause prohibiting munitions to belligerent countries exists for a single day, it will please the aggressor country and continue to attack world peace. The American people must support President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull's policy of sympathizing with resistance to aggression. The American people must quickly demand that Congress speedily enact legislation to prevent Japan from obtaining military raw materials from the United States, because although Japan is using these munitions to fight against China today, it will later use them to fight against any other democratic country in the world.

<h3>British Fascist Party's Peace Plan; Mosley's Speech</h3>
<p>(London) Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists, delivered a speech on his peace plan yesterday before an audience of over 25,000. The key points are four: (1) Britain should cease political activity in Eastern Europe; (2) Western European countries should reduce armaments; (3) Germany's former colonies should be returned to Germany to show that Britain already possesses vast territories and does not need mandated territories; (4) Britain should concentrate its attention on the Empire itself to proclaim to the world that British citizens will defend the Empire to the last person. Sir Mosley believes that if this peace plan could be implemented, it would not only maintain peace in the present but also for generations to come. (Haitong, 17th)</p>

<h3>Southern Balkan Countries Strengthen Relations with Britain; Key Figures from Both Countries to Visit Britain Simultaneously; Diplomatic Talks to Commence Soon</h3>
<p>(London) Prince Paul, the First Regent of Yugoslavia, and Mochalov (currently in Paris), the Speaker of the Bulgarian National Assembly, have both departed to visit Britain and are expected to arrive here within days. Diplomatic circles attach great importance to this, saying that the peace front organized by Britain and France in Europe is likely to attract Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, which are also happy to join. The outcome will be known after they hold diplomatic talks with British authorities within this week. Recently, it has been rumored that the governments of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria intend to request commercial credit loans from the British government. If so, the attitudes of the two countries will undergo extremely important changes. According to well-informed sources, Bulgaria has adopted a strictly neutral attitude towards Germany, and even in the case of Yugoslavia, Germany's efforts to court them have failed. Britain should seize this opportunity to prevent Yugoslavia and Bulgaria from leaning towards the Axis powers. It is said that after Bulgarian National Assembly Speaker Mochalov arrives here, he will discuss various commercial and financial issues with British authorities, hoping to increase trade between Britain and Bulgaria. However, it is not yet known whether the talks will extend to political issues. According to the British government's intention, if Bulgaria insists on reclaiming the Dobruja region from Romania, it will be difficult to wholeheartedly support the democratic front, and the British government will not be able to consider granting loans.

<h3>Japan Uses White Russians in "Manchukuo" as a Barrier Against the Soviet Union; Successively Sent to the Outer Mongolian Border; A Small Number of White Russians Have Left Harbin for Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the large-scale conflicts on the border between Outer Mongolia and "Manchukuo" are not only a concern for the Chinese, who believe they will inevitably affect the Sino-Japanese war, but also for the White Russians in this port, because many of their relatives still live in "Manchukuo," and now their news is lost. In the past five days, eighteen White Russians, aged sixteen to twenty-two, have arrived in Shanghai from Harbin. They faced great difficulties when leaving "Manchukuo." According to them, the</p>
<p>White Russian Youths</p>
<p>in major cities in "Manchukuo" such as Harbin, Shenyang, Changchun, and Dalian have now been mobilized and sent to the battlefield. Every day, groups of twenty to thirty people are sent to the Outer Mongolian border. At the beginning of this month, an airplane appeared in the sky over northern Harbin, flying very high, causing panic throughout the city. Initially, people believed the plane was a Soviet military aircraft, but it did not drop any bombs. To this day, the nationality of the plane is unknown. People are generally concerned about the</p>
<p>Soviet Bombing</p>
<p>of Hulunbuir. Rumors of a rapid advance by Soviet-Mongolian forces are rampant. Apart from these rumors, Harbin is still peaceful. Little news of the border battles is heard, and only the reports deemed appropriate by the Japanese official news agency are disseminated to the outside world. The White Russians residing in "Manchukuo" now live in a state of anxiety because the Kwantung Army clearly intends to use the White Russians against the Soviet army. A White Russian who recently returned to Shanghai from Harbin spoke to a high-ranking officer of the Japanese Kenpeitai about this matter before departing for Shanghai. That person clearly stated the Japanese side's attitude. According to that</p>
<p>Japanese Officer,</p>
<p>the Kwantung Army believes that the White Russians should welcome the opportunity to "defeat the Communists." Since the White Russians are eager to overthrow the Soviet regime, the Japanese side does not need to inquire about the attitudes of the White Russians residing in "Manchukuo." They will gladly take up arms to resist the Soviet government. However, the number of White Russians in "Manchukuo" has decreased from 100,000 before the Japanese annexation to 25,000, and they have learned from</p>
<p>Painful Experience</p>
<p>the true purpose of Japan in Manchuria. White Russians in Manchuria are employed as laborers, for which they demand higher wages than the Chinese, and as managers, but they are not as good as the Japanese. The Japanese side claims that the reason for the existence of these immigrants in Manchuria is because they are a potential barrier against the Red Army. Therefore, the 25,000 White Russians in Manchuria have become puppet reserves, and when Japan invades Soviet territory, they may be called upon to fight.</p>
<h3>30,000 People's Army in Lingdong Recovers Chenghai County Seat; Weng Zhaoyuan and Others Engage in Training Strong Young Men</h3>
<p>A Swatow dispatch: Since Swatow fell during the Dragon Boat Festival, it has been cut off from news from other ports. British ships passing outside the port of Swatow do not enter anymore because there are no goods to load or unload in Swatow. They stop outside Ma Islet for several hours. The British warships stationed in front of the British and American consulates dispatch speedboats to shuttle back and forth, supplying food exclusively to foreigners and transporting mail.</p>
<p>In the past ten days, the British ship "New Chaozhou" has been running between Hong Kong and Haifeng Shanwei, Lufeng Jieshi, delivering pigs, chickens, eggs, etc. to Hong Kong for sale. Chinese letters are sent out by sailboats, but the cost is high. In addition to affixing enough postage stamps to each letter, one yuan in legal tender is required to be handed over to the "Thousand-Li Horse" (i.e., fast runner) to travel day and night. Departing from Swatow Chao Yang, it may be possible to reach Jieshi or Lufeng the next day, and the letters can reach Hong Kong in three days. The "New Chaozhou" is a ship of the Jie Shun Company on Connaught Road West, Hong Kong, sailing between Hong Kong and Haifeng. British warships often protect the sea. Overseas returnees from the Meizhou region, after arriving in Hong Kong, travel via Shenzhen to Huiyang, then to Laolong Xingning. This route is not safe, because Changping, Zhenlong Jiazibu on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway are in the midst of battle. Without supporting documents, it is difficult to pass. If one takes a boat from Hong Kong to Jieshi, enters Hepo via Hetian, and exits to Fengshun via Wuhua Anliu, although this route is more expensive, it is very peaceful now because there are regular troops suppressing it, and travel is very convenient. Recently, the scope of the Lingdong war has been limited to the area along the Chao-Shan Railway, the tributaries of the Han River, and the coast of Chenghai. A small number of Japanese marines in Chao Yang, Dadun, and Guanbu</p>
<p>withdrew automatically after July 4th. The cadre of strong young men who were previously trained by Weng Zhaoyuan and Chen Shumu in Meizhou are automatically forming joint defenses in various villages. Weng Zhaoyuan was ordered to go to Liusha, Puning, to re-summon the personnel of the former 8th District Command and consolidate the grassroots work, assist the farmers, and rush to harvest the paddy fields so that the new grain can be brought to market early. Liu Zhilu also arrived in Chenghai, Sunan, Zhanglin, and Donglong to summon the cadre of strong young men, assign work, and implement joint village defense. Chenghai City fell on June 30th. At that time, the Japanese army advanced in two routes. The Masaki unit took more than 30 speedboats and towed 20-30 civilian boats down the tributaries of the Han River. The Takeda unit attacked Ouding from Swatow and then divided its forces to attack Chenghai. The county seat was attacked by land and water. The defending military police scattered to Guanshan Township, Beilong, Henglong, Chenghai Nanyang Township, the Upper, Middle, and Lower Three Stoves, and the Wai Sha Si Jiwei. These areas were originally haunted by pirates and bandits. The bandit leader Wang Xiyue (a native of Nanyang Township) surrendered to the Japanese army and served as the captain of the special investigation team. The old bandit subordinates of Li Li, Wang A'wu, and Chen Ke Dang, numbering more than 300, were all incorporated by Wang Xiyue into plainclothes special teams, carrying knives and guns on their waists,</p>
<p>rampaging through the countryside. They were born and raised in this hometown and knew who was wealthy and who was the village chief. Therefore, they preyed on the elders of this hometown. A village chief surnamed Li in Shangzao was kidnapped and sent to the Japanese army in Chengcheng, and later redeemed for 8,000 yuan. More than 50 strong young men over the age of 20 were arrested and sent to the Wang Family Ancestral Hall. Each person was extorted at least 200-300 yuan. Those who could not raise the money were sent to the Japanese military camp and identified as plainclothes guerrillas and more than ten were shot. Women aged sixteen to twenty-four, those who were slightly beautiful, were escorted to the Japanese military camp in Swatow. Boys under the age of six were also snatched away. Many women and children were taken from Wu, Ouding, and Qishan and imprisoned in empty buildings on Yongping Road, Swatow. On the evening of the 5th, the six</p>
<p>major surnames of Du, Li, Wang, Cai, Yu, and Chen held a meeting and immediately mobilized the strong young men's team and captured five or sixty of the bandits who were acting as special investigation team members. Very few escaped. Nanyang Township has 30,000 residents and thousands of strong young men, who cooperated with the Sunan guerrillas, crossed the river, and attacked Chenghai City without any effort, recovering the city. The Japanese troops on the North Dike, hearing gunshots in Beilong, did not know the truth and all fled to Swatow on boats.</p>
<p>Chongqing Municipality Controls Prices and Plans to Establish Public Sales Offices; Builds Markets in the Suburbs</p>
<p>A Chongqing dispatch: The Chongqing Municipal Government is actively proceeding with the construction of suburban markets and joint business offices. It has decided to raise 3 million yuan for the construction of suburban markets. All construction matters are handled by the construction committee established by the Dredging Committee. Joint business offices have been decided to be established in two locations. More than 200 stores have joined the business. Stores participating in the business are currently renovating shop fronts and moving goods. After everything is ready, it will open. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is now planning to establish public sales offices and city markets. The establishment of public sales offices aims to manage the goods in the market, regulate their availability, and control their prices. This public sales office will adopt a system of official supervision and merchant management, that is, it will be operated by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, supervised and directed by the Social Affairs Bureau, and has requested a loan of one million yuan from the local banking community as funds. The banking community has given its agreement in principle. As for the city market, its form is similar to the temple fairs in Beijing and the flower fairs in Chengdu, but this is a long-term nature. In the future, both small and medium-sized capital merchants and vendors can request to participate in the business. It is said that the above two plans are sufficient to supplement the deficiencies of suburban markets and joint business markets, and further enable the flow of goods and facilitate supply and demand. Also, from the perspective of the actual situation in Chongqing, since the Municipal Government has been striving to restore the market and regulate supply and demand for more than a month, the prices of general daily necessities have been gradually stabilized.</p>
<h3>American Ambassador Uses "Hesitant Stupidity" to Criticize a Few Americans</h3>
<p>A Chongqing dispatch: Recently, French Ambassador Cosme and American Ambassador Johnson arrived in Chongqing one after another. Grand tea parties were held here one after another to warmly welcome them. The French Ambassador was welcomed at a tea party held by the China National Diplomacy Association at the Sheng Sheng Garden on June 21st. At the welcome reception held by the Sino-American Cultural Association at Fanzhuang on July 1st, the American Ambassador's reply was earnest and full of interest. Chairman Kong Xiangxi delivered a welcome speech, saying that the Ambassador was the first representative of friendly countries to travel on the Yunnan-Burma Road and must be very interested in China's recent transportation development. The majority of the American people sympathize with China's resistance against Japan, which can be seen anytime and anywhere. The examples are too numerous to mention. Recent public opinion polls show that 74% of the American people express their willingness to help China, only 2% can be considered pro-Japanese, and the remaining 24% can be said to be still unclear about the relationship between China and Japan. One of the purposes of the establishment of the Sino-American Cultural Association is to make these 24% of friendly people understand the actual problems involved in the Sino-Japanese War and hope that they will turn to jointly support China. Ambassador Johnson replied, praising the Sino-American Cultural Association as a very meaningful organization, wishing its unlimited development in the future, and at the same time, after being able to make great efforts in the culture of China and the United States, he targeted Chairman Kong's words, seriously and humorously, to make his wonderfully unsurpassed speech, saying that in December last year, he heard of a newly built road reaching the Burmese border. Because he was lucky, he was able to pass through the road during his vacation back home. His companions were Major McHugh and an experienced Chinese chauffeur. It only took 12 days from Chongqing to Yangon, and there were no accidents along the way, but he felt that he had gone through a scenic spot. However, there was an "accident" that occurred, that is, when passing through a certain place, he saw two chickens on the side of the road. Seeing the car was about to pass, one of the roosters wanted to cross, but quickly passed. The hen initially had a hesitant attitude. When she decided to follow her partner, it was no longer possible. Because he immediately laughed and said that he had no intention of discussing moral</p>
<p>issues in this kind of "accident," or perhaps the stupidity of this follower can represent the psychology of 24% of Americans. In conclusion, he expressed his joy in returning to his old team and thanked Chairman Kong and others for their kindness.</p>
<h3>Rich Mineral Deposits in the Virgin Land of Xikang; Li Huang, Huang Yanpei, and Others Return to Sichuan</h3>
<p>A Chengdu airmail report: Li Huang, head of the Sichuan-Xikang inspection group of the National Political Council, and Huang Yanpei, the deputy head, led the inspection team of the southern route, departing from Rong in the spring, to inspect the Ningdu area, a treasure virgin land in Xikang Province.</p>
<p>Lasting Two Months,</p>
<p>they traveled through more than a dozen counties, deep into the wilderness, and inspected the actual situation. Now the official work has been completed, and they have returned to Rong via Xichang and Ya'an. Mr. Li Huang spoke with a very optimistic attitude, talking about the excellent impressions gained from the inspection of the counties in the Ningdu virgin land of Xikang. He holds unlimited bright hopes for the future of the development of Ningdu treasures. He said that the land in Ningdu is fertile and the treasures are abundant. If they are fully developed, they can be comparable to any powerful country in Europe and the United States. As far as mineral products are concerned, gold, silver, copper, and iron are all available throughout the territory, and the quality is excellent. The iron ore in Mianchi and Lugu has an iron content of 60% and iron reserves of</p>
<p>30 Million Tons.</p>
<p>In addition, Hu Boyuan, a technician from the Ministry of Economic Affairs who accompanied the inspection, is a well-known mineral master in the country. According to him, to develop the treasures of Ningdu, one should first start developing light industry to decide to proceed with building heavy industry. The silk, leather, sugar, and cotton of Ningdu exported from Kunming every year reach 200 yuan. If the government advocates and encourages planting, the output will increase, and the prospects for export trade can be optimistic. As for heavy industry construction, the government already has a</p>
<p>Complete Plan.</p>
<p>However, the current obstacles to development are transportation and opium addiction, which are of great importance. The construction of highways and the prohibition of opium addiction are being actively worked on by the central government and the Kang Provincial Government, and they can be completed. The virgin treasure land of Xikang is Ningdu in the southeast. Ningdu includes Xichang, Mianning, Huali, Yanyuan, Yanbian, and other counties.</p>

<h3>Finance Market: Buying Trend Strengthens in the After-Market; Foreign Exchange Futures Tighten</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, with HSBC's listed prices, remained unchanged. The informal trading of British and American currencies showed stability. The spot market conditions were considered stable. In the afternoon, due to some settlements by foreign firms, the American dollar slightly tightened, but later returned to stability. The settlement of the British pound was also finalized. Futures initially loosened but then tightened; initially, HSBC released Hong Kong telegrams for sale, and it was rumored that banks in North China had stopped using banknotes in the city to prevent a certain party from using North China banknotes soon to arrive in Shanghai to acquire foreign exchange. For a time, speculators were helpless. Therefore, although Sassoon and Japanese banks continued to buy, supply still exceeded demand, causing the market to loosen significantly. The British pound once loosened to 6 pence and 21/875, and the American dollar also hardened to 12.09375 yuan. However, soon after, due to the continued aggressive purchases by Japanese banks and no purchases by Hong Kong telegrams, but HSBC was unwilling to sell further at this time, the market became even tighter. By the close of the evening, the British pound was 6 pence and 34/375, the American dollar was 12.375 yuan, the August British pound was 6 pence and 06/25, and the American dollar re-entered the 12 yuan mark at 11.8125 yuan. Therefore, the swap spread was very wide, and interest was favorable, but no transactions were heard to have occurred. Spot and current month transactions were sparse, while August transactions were quite heavy. As for the Hong Kong dollar, it continued to harden due to strong buying interest from foreign firms.</p>
<p>August Futures Trading Particularly Active</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, London's spot and forward prices were flat, New York's silver prices remained unchanged, and London's raw gold also remained steady. Exchange rates: British pound against US dollar was slightly lower by 0.6 hao, against Shanghai unchanged, against France slightly lower by 0.1 centime. US dollar against British pound, against Shanghai, and against France all remained unchanged. Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. At the morning opening, banks' spot selling prices were: British pound at 6 pence and 56/25, American dollar at 12.78125 yuan, both unchanged from the previous Saturday afternoon close. After the opening, foreign firms first bought HSBC's spot British pound at 6 pence and 56/25, and then bought American banks' spot American dollar at 12.78125 yuan. The market was extremely calm. After HSBC's listed prices were announced, there were no changes. When the silver equalization tax was announced, it was still exempt. Subsequently, the Netherlands offered favorable August British pound at 6 pence and 18/75. Later, HSBC's selling interest in July and August futures was also strong (reportedly commissioned by Hong Kong). Therefore, although Japanese banks and Western merchant Sassoon and others frequently absorbed, the position was still ample, causing the situation to harden. It is estimated that HSBC sold current month British pound to peer banks at 6 pence and 43/75. Subsequently, a certain bank offered current month American dollar to peer banks, hardening from 12.5 yuan to 56/25. At that time, HSBC also offered August British pound to Japanese banks and Western merchant Sassoon, hardening to 6 pence and 21/875. At the same time, August American dollar also loosened to 12.09375 yuan. After that, because HSBC's selling interest weakened, coupled with the continued purchases by Japanese banks, and it was heard that Hong Kong telegrams were also active, the underlying trend turned flat. Japanese banks then bought favorable August British pound at 6 pence and 15/625. Subsequently, Hong Kong telegrams also absorbed foreign firms' August British pound at 6 pence and 12/5. Later, Hong Kong telegrams and Chinese merchants and speculators successively bought foreign firms' August American dollar at 12 yuan and 11.9375 yuan. Nearing noon, the Netherlands sold spot Hong Kong dollar to foreign firms at a price of 44.125 yuan, and the situation slightly hardened. Extending to the noon close, the banks' spot selling prices for both British and American currencies were the same as the morning opening. The current month British pound remained at 6 pence and 40/625, the American dollar at 12.4375 yuan, the August British pound at 6 pence and 12/5, and the American dollar at 11.9375 yuan.</p>
<p>Spot Settlement Unchanged</p>
<p>In the after-market, foreign firms continued to buy HSBC's spot British pound at 6 pence and 56/25, and also bought a certain bank's spot American dollar at 12.75 yuan. The market situation was flat for the British pound and slightly soft for the American dollar. At that time, foreign firms such as HSBC were still very reluctant to supply futures, but their appetite was excellent, causing the market to tighten. It is estimated that a certain bank absorbed Bombay Silver Company's current month American dollar at 12.4375 yuan. Subsequently, Sino-Belgian also absorbed Chinese yarn and flower merchants' current month American dollar, softening from 12.4375 yuan to 37/5. Later, McAllister absorbed peer banks' August British pound at 6 pence and 70/9375. At that time, foreign firms such as Anderson were still willing to supply spot Hong Kong dollar at a price of 44.125 yuan, but no transactions were heard to have occurred. Extending to the evening close, the banks' spot selling prices were: British pound at 6 pence and 56/25, American dollar at 12.78125 yuan, current month British pound at 6 pence and 34/375, American dollar at 12.375 yuan, August British pound at 6 pence and 06/25, and American dollar at 11.8125 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous weekend, the spot British and American currencies remained unchanged. The current month British pound tightened by 06/25, the American dollar softened by 06/25, the August British pound shrank by 06/25, the American dollar appreciated by 12/5. The Hong Kong dollar hardened by 12/5 when calculated at the last price.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Sharp Drop in Tianjin Gold Prices: Impact: The Local Market Once Plunged; Foreign Exchange Tightens: Causes a Buying Trend and Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold informal market situation was unpredictable. The overall situation was roughly stable initially, then fell, and then recovered to stability. At the initial opening, money changers suddenly sold aggressively (it was heard that the market was rumored to have sharply dropped in Tianjin gold prices, only worth 2,600 yuan in Korean notes, and only worth 2,210 yuan in legal tender. However, this may be due to the inferior quality of the gold bars, etc. There was no such large difference from local gold prices). However, because silversmiths, local wealthy merchants, and Hong Kong merchants suddenly bought in, supply and demand were balanced, and there was little change. By noon, the market seemed to lack support and fell to close at 2,604 yuan. In the afternoon, the futures exchange rate reported a decrease, which triggered a buying trend. The Guangdong merchant group and local wealthy merchants had a strong buying interest, and the price rose to 2,622 yuan. The result closed at 2,619 yuan, equivalent to the previous weekend's noon closing price. Trading was still active, with about 1,000 taels traded throughout the day. Silversmiths' jewelry gold initially fell and then rose, ultimately with no change. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Settlement Without Change</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened fairly flat. The opening price was slightly lower by one yuan. Money changers sold 50 taels to gold shops at a price of 2,618 yuan. After the opening, although money changers frequently sold aggressively (reportedly selling on behalf of Tianjin merchant groups), the Hong Kong merchant groups had not yet absorbed it, and local wealthy merchants also had an appetite, so the market was extremely mediocre. Money changers and peer banks mutually traded 20 taels at a price of 19 yuan. At the same time, money changers sold another 100 taels to silversmiths (on behalf of wealthy merchants) at a price of 18 yuan. Subsequently, they also sold 100 taels to a certain silversmith (on behalf of Hong Kong merchant groups) at the same price. Soon after, silversmiths bought another 50 taels from money changers on behalf of wealthy merchants at a price of 20 yuan. At that time, the buying interest suddenly faded, and the price fell sharply, instantly dropping by six yuan. Money changers mutually traded 20 taels at a price of 14 yuan. After that, securities firms suddenly developed a buying trend, and the price briefly recovered slightly. Securities firms bought 100 taels from money changers at a price of 17 yuan. Then, they bought another 50 taels from money changers at a price of 16 yuan. At that time, securities firms stopped buying and observed, and others had no appetite, causing the price to decline again, soon falling by eight yuan. Cash gold shops sold 50 taels to a certain silversmith at a price of 08 yuan. Later, money changers bought another 50 taels from a certain broker at a price of 11 yuan. At noon, money changers mutually traded 50 taels at a price of 05 yuan, and a certain silversmith returned 50 taels to the gold shop at a price of 04 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange futures suddenly tightened, which triggered a buying trend, causing the market to gradually recover. The opening price immediately rose by six yuan. Money changers bought 10 taels from silversmiths at a price of 10 yuan. At that time, sellers became increasingly scarce, instantly raising the price by nine yuan. A certain gold shop bought 50 taels from silversmiths at a price of 19 yuan. Subsequently, money changers mutually traded 10 taels at a price of 18 yuan. Later, a certain silversmith bought 50 taels from money changers at a price of 20 yuan. Soon after, money changers mutually traded 10 taels at 22 yuan, which was the peak of the day. After that, sellers took advantage of the high prices to sell, causing the price to fall slightly. Money changers mutually traded 50 taels at a price of 21 yuan. At 3:01 PM, silversmiths mutually traded 50 taels at a price of 2,619 yuan, which was the evening closing price. As a result, there was no change compared to the previous weekend's noon closing price. The price fluctuated by 18 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold shops' own brand gold was 2,625 yuan, and the buying price was 2,610 yuan. The current mark-up gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold. According to inquiries, there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Silversmiths' Jewelry Gold Initially Small, Then Large</p>
<p>The exchange rate for silversmiths' jewelry gold per tael initially remained unchanged. At 12:01 PM, because cash gold weakened, it was also lowered by one yuan. Later, at 3:50 PM, because cash gold suddenly rebounded, it also rose by one yuan. As a result, there was no change. It is estimated that major peers still quoted 265 yuan, new peers quoted 263 yuan, and bought in at 257 yuan.</p>
<p>Sino-British Pure Gold Remained Unchanged</p>
<p>The market prices of the Central Bank remained unchanged. It is estimated that the buying price for Chinese cash remained at 1,211 yuan and 9 jiao, the listed customs gold remained at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li, and the Shanghai standard mark-up price also remained at 1,207 yuan and 2 jiao. This was due to the London telegram of the 15th, which showed that the British pure gold remained unchanged, at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 5.5 pence per ounce.</p>
<h3>Bank Clearinghouse: Reduces Interbank Lending Rate</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association Clearinghouse, from yesterday (July 17th), revised the interbank lending rate as follows:</p>
<p>Interbank Transfer Withdrawal Rate: 2 jiao, 1 fen</p>
<p>Interbank Transfer Deposit Rate: 1 jiao, 6 fen</p>
<p>(Calculated per 1,000 yuan per day)</p>
<p>"Note" The interbank transfer withdrawal rate was 2 jiao, 5 jiao on July 4th, then changed to 2 jiao, 3 fen from the 10th, and now changed again to 2 jiao, 1 fen, a decrease of 4 fen. The interbank transfer deposit rate also decreased accordingly, both being 5 fen lower than the interbank transfer withdrawal rate. As for the interest rate on public debt clearing and the discount rate for 90-day accepted drafts, there have been no changes since the 4th, remaining at 2 jiao, 8 fen for national currency and 2 jiao, 5 fen for interbank transfer.</p>
<h3>Rediscount Rate Rises Again: Demand for Cash is Strong; Final Rate at 109 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rediscount rate for interbank transfer bills continued to rise. Initially, it was still around 100 yuan per 1,000 yuan, but later, seeing the strong demand for cash absorption, it rose sharply to 106 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it rose further to a final 109 yuan, 9 yuan higher than last week. As for the Money Dealers Association's interbank lending rate, it gradually decreased after the use of interbank transfers. Yesterday, it was slightly lower by 2 fen, at 1 jiao, 6 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>US Dollar and Pound Sterling: Rise More Sharply</h3>
<p>Last Saturday, British pure gold and British-American exchange rates remained unchanged. Yesterday, in this city, foreign firms settled accounts heavily, foreign banks' supply was smooth, and market prices were stable without change. Cash gold opened stably at a price of 2,618 yuan. Later, Tianjin merchant groups' supply suddenly increased, retail demand was sluggish, and market prices fluctuated downward. The noon closing price was a low of 604 yuan. In the afternoon, cash gold shops and money changers bought at low prices, and the market situation stabilized. The opening price was 2,610 yuan. Forward exchange rates tightened, customers' confidence strengthened, and buying enthusiasm increased. Market prices rose, returning to their previous levels. The evening closing price was 19 yuan. As a result, there was no change compared to last Saturday. Foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, were in strong demand, and supply was not smooth. The British gold pound was flat, and the American gold pound rebounded more sharply. British gold notes were actively traded, and market prices fluctuated. British gold notes rose, and American gold notes fell slightly. Because spot exchange rates were stable, they could not advance sharply. The supply of Hong Kong notes, French franc notes, etc., increased, and market prices eased. Dutch guilder notes and rupee notes were in strong demand and continued to trend upward. The supply of Japanese gold notes was quite smooth, and the market situation was weak. The evening price was 9 jiao, 9 fen, and 1 li. Korean won was rarely supplied and demanded, and the market was stable, remaining at 8 jiao, 5 fen, and 5 li. Transactions at the association were rare. Only Xiang Kang sold 100 pounds of British gold notes to Yongfeng. Yesterday's market prices: British gold notes rose by 2 fen, American gold pound rose by 4 jiao, American gold notes fell by 1 fen, Hong Kong notes fell by 5 li, French franc notes fell by 1 li, Singapore notes and Canadian notes each fell by 2 fen, Australian gold notes fell by 1 jiao, Dutch guilder notes and rupee notes each rose by 1 fen. Other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Securities: Legal Tender Position Becomes Tighter; Domestic Bonds Struggle to Rise; Foreign Stocks Also Lack Vitality</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities informal market situation felt sluggish. Because of conflicting news, people were bewildered. One piece of news was the talk of British and American loans, but it was still just speculation. The other piece of news was that cracks had appeared in the British-Japanese conference, and the situation in Europe was becoming increasingly tense. Market sentiment was initially firm but then softened. There was still no reliable news about the Seventh Installment of principal and interest. Long investors were hesitant, mainly because credit was still too tight. The monthly interest on foreign exchange arbitrage could reach as high as 5-6 fen. Cash was fleeing, and the amount was alarming. The legal tender discount rose to around 110 yuan. Furthermore, banks were not accepting banknotes from other provinces. As a result, the legal tender position became increasingly tight, credit became tighter, and long positions found it increasingly difficult to develop. The market situation became increasingly sluggish, and it was not easy to be optimistic about the trend due to the complex environment. Yesterday's situation was initially firm but then weakened. Both buyers and sellers were not enthusiastic. Buyers were Hengfu, Runli, and Lianhe, and sellers were Tongkang, Shuntai, and No. 14. Transactions were extremely quiet. Therefore, the results were mixed, with fluctuations of only 5 fen to 1-2 jiao. The 96 bonds, which had not been traded for over a month, suddenly started trading, more than 6 jiao lower than the previous price. The total number of transactions was estimated to be 200,000-300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category	Highest	Lowest	Closing	Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified Bonds	59.10	58.80	59.10	Up 0.25</p>
<p>Unified Bonds B	49.85	49.75	49.85	Up 0.10</p>
<p>Unified Bonds C	48.60	48.25	48.30	Down 0.05</p>
<p>Unified Bonds D	47.70	47.55	47.60	Up 0.05</p>
<p>Unified Bonds E	48.00	47.80	47.90	Down 0.10</p>
<p>96 Bonds	5.90	……	5.90	Up 0.60</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 12 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen.</p>
<p>The Public Traders Association reported that yesterday's stock market continued to be weak and lifeless due to the impact of the tightening of forward foreign exchange. Buyers were all hesitant, and transactions were scarce. Only Jardine Matheson shares had slight demand, with a price of around 17 yuan and 9 jiao. The closing buying price was also that price. English Shanghai Land shares were still noticed, with a price of 18 yuan. However, transactions for all items were negligible throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Suspends Use of North China Legal Tender</h3>
<p>(1) Cautious Action</p>
<p>Since yesterday, the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China and Bank of Communications have temporarily suspended accepting legal tender from North China (such as Tianjin, Shandong, Qingdao, Jinan, etc.) due to the high exchange rate of Tianjin Shanghai exchange. As a result, the industrial and commercial circles in this city also refused to use this legal tender. The event of this city refusing to use legal tender from North China also occurred once in March last year. Later, because the Bank of China and Bank of Communications accepted it as usual, the trend quickly subsided. For more than a year, people had gradually forgotten about this event. Unexpectedly, this decision, due to the continuous rise in Tianjin Shanghai exchange, reaching a maximum of 138 yuan (i.e., 138 yuan of Tianjin legal tender to pay 100 yuan of Shanghai legal tender, recently 132-3 yuan), had to refuse to accept it in order to block the southward flow of North China legal tender, prevent the two banks' losses on exchange, and cut off the path for speculative merchants to make profits.</p>
<p>Moreover, the significance of suspending the use of North China legal tender is not limited to this. Upon reviewing the fluctuations of Tianjin Shanghai exchange in recent months, they have all shifted according to the difference between foreign exchange in Tianjin and Shanghai. In the past, the distance between exchange rates was limited, and Shanghai exchange could still maintain its balance. However, in the past month, Tianjin has been affected by the Japanese military blockade, and people's hearts are weak. Foreign exchange has changed, losing its normal course. The lowest record was when the British exchange softened to 4 pence 75, and the American exchange was only 9 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen (on the 8th and 10th of this month). Compared with Shanghai's market, British exchange was still maintained at 6 pence 5625, and the American exchange was still maintained at a level of 12 yuan 78125. If we can use this exchange rate arbitrage, selling foreign currency in Tianjin, receiving legal tender, and finding a way to transport it to Shanghai to replenish foreign exchange, the profit would be abundant in one turn. However, given the special circumstances, although we know that it is so, we cannot ask for it. Those who can operate freely are, of course, only a few special figures. Such exchange rate arbitrage not only affects the foundation of legal tender but also damages the foreign exchange fund. The Bank of China and Bank of Communications' resolute suspension also has its unavoidable difficulties. We should not rashly add any criticism.</p>
<p>However, since the implementation of the legal tender policy, the past issuance boundaries have long been eliminated, and the number of legal tender from North China flowing into this area is also not small. This decision, coupled with the suspension of use, although it is heard that there is a saying of changing to pay North China drafts, only a small number of people can temporarily remit to Tianjin and Beijing to wait for a better opportunity. However, those small workers and small merchants who hold this small amount of legal tender have not made adequate preparations in advance, and will probably not know where to go. If they do not seek a solution soon, they will only give villains an excuse to slander legal tender, which is extremely unwise. It is hoped that the authorities of the two banks will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>(2) Ying Jun</p>
<p>North China Bank of China and Bank of Communications legal tender has been generally usable in the market recently, but since the Bank of China and Bank of Communications stopped exchanging North China banknotes yesterday, it was like a bolt from the blue, and the entire financial world has taken this issue as the center of discussion, while the general public holding banknotes are unaware. It is said that it is due to exchange rate market conditions, in order to prevent speculators from taking advantage. Upon investigation, the biggest difference between Tianjin and Shanghai exchange rates was on the 8th of this month, with a price of 138 yuan, that is, 138 yuan of Tianjin legal tender is equivalent to 100 yuan of Shanghai legal tender, that is, 1 yuan of North China legal tender is only worth 7 jiao, 2 fen, and 4 li of Shanghai legal tender. As of last Saturday (the 15th), Tianjin Shanghai exchange had risen back to 132 yuan, which is equivalent to a little over 7 jiao and 5 fen of Shanghai legal tender. Yesterday's price was 133 yuan, which is also equivalent to over 7 jiao and 5 fen. However, the Bank of China and Bank of Communications did not declare in advance and stopped exchanging yesterday, making it impossible for the general public and the poor to exchange the banknotes they received. The smoke and exchange shops took the opportunity to collect exchange fees. It is said that yesterday, every 100 yuan required a fee of 10 yuan, only exchanging 90 yuan, and some even exchanged at 70%. According to the latest report, the total amount of Tianjin banknotes issued is 322,242,605 yuan. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>As of June 17, 1939</p>
<p>Bank Name	Issuance Amount</p>
<p>Central Bank	36,593,505</p>
<p>Bank of China	162,233,100</p>
<p>Bank of Communications	78,500,000</p>
<p>Four Banks	1,500,000</p>
<p>China Industrial	1,750,000</p>
<p>China Agricultural and Industrial	1,500,000</p>
<p>China Reclamation	90,000</p>
<p>Zhejiang Industrial	20,000</p>
<p>Da Zhong Bank	56,000</p>
<p>Hebei Provincial Bank	50,000,000</p>
<p>Total	322,242,605</p>
<p>Except for the Central Bank banknotes of 36,593,505 yuan that did not have a place name printed, the amount of banknotes printed with the Tianjin place name was 295,649,100 yuan, of which the Bank of China and Bank of Communications accounted for over 240 million yuan. Currently, in the Shanghai market, since the recent bank withdrawal trend, various banks have paid out a lot of miscellaneous banknotes from North China and other provinces. If they stop exchanging immediately, the general public will suffer considerable losses. It is hoped that the authorities, at this time of legal tender unification and sufficient preparation, will continue to use them uniformly regardless of place name in order to avoid affecting the credit of legal tender. We should also allow a few days' grace period, on the one hand, to publish a notice in the newspaper to inform the general public, no longer to receive and use it, and to allow a deadline for exchanging Shanghai legal tender in order to avoid unexpected losses.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Fabric: Transactions Among Peers Greatly Reduced; Cotton Yarn Rises and Then Falls; Guangdong Merchants' Appetite is Also Satiated</h3>
<p>The yarn market started strong and then retreated, and the situation was peaceful. This is because of the continuous demand for coarse and fine yarn in the South China area, which is developing residential areas. Transactions among peers, buying and selling, have been greatly reduced, probably because financial contraction and shortage of cash chips have greatly constrained the power of activity. The changes in market prices have also entered the normal range. Sales are good, the market rises, sales are sluggish, the market is weak, and the range of ups and downs only hovers between 4-5 yuan.</p>
<p>The morning opening of spot yarn market did not have major transactions, and the opening was slightly soft. The price of 20-count double-strand yarn outside the warehouse was 487 yuan. The Hong Kong merchants bought 40-50 bales, and the warehouse receipt price was not opened. A short time later, the customer merchants' appetite for spot goods did not weaken, and people's hearts were lifted. The selling price increased and gradually rose again. The Yunnan merchants' purchase of coarse yarn was also prosperous, and the demand for 23-count and 21-count fine yarn was also not weak. The 20-count double-horse yarn outside the warehouse once reached 491 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 485.5 yuan. By the time of closing, it was heard that the Guangdong merchants' Wanxing Company had satiated its appetite and spat out floating profits, and it immediately fell back again. The closing price of 20-count double-horse yarn outside the warehouse was 488 yuan, and the warehouse receipt was 481 yuan. As a result, the turnover for half a day was 1,640 bales. The market price of 20-count double-horse yarn did not have much difference compared to the previous day, but the 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd yarn was 2-3 yuan higher than the previous day. The 10-count coarse yarn was also firm. Hongzhang Factory opened 200 bales of 10-count New Bao Yi yarn at a price of 410 yuan, with delivery in August. Yesterday, 18 pieces of cotton yarn came from Ningbo. Today, 370 bales are exported to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Hong Kong	795	Yunnan	325	Jiangxi	70</p>
<p>Wenzhou	20	Peers	395	Inland	35</p>
<p>Statistics	1,640</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market opened in the early morning, continuing to advance and rise, carrying on the enthusiasm of the previous day. The 20-count Moon Qin yarn appeared outside the 400 yuan mark. Soon after, due to bad news and quiet actual sales, it fell back again. By the closing price, the 20-count Moon Qin spot was priced at 400 yuan to 399 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cash Chips Become Shorter; Cotton Transactions Become Quieter</h3>
<p>The external cotton market price: The New York cotton market was quite tired due to the weekend. Long investors closed positions and reversed short selling, causing the market price to sink. Later, due to telegrams from Mumbai reporting a drop, and the spot prices in the South were weak. The US government signed an agreement in England on the 23rd of last month to borrow 600,000 bales of American cotton. Because the price situation is complex, it is said that there may be a delay in execution. As a result, New York fell by 8 pounds, and India fell by 1 rupee together with the forecast. Egypt's market closed.</p>
<p>Since the telegram from Malaysia, external cotton transactions in Shanghai have become increasingly difficult. Yesterday, the local city had a large amount of banknotes with place names from North China. In order to prevent the purchase of foreign exchange, the use of these notes was suspended, causing the amount of legal tender chips to become even scarcer and payment upon arrival to become even more difficult.</p>
<p>Domestic cotton transactions were quiet, and not a single transaction was made. Because goods were scarce and factories had a shortage of legal tender, they also had no intention of buying, so they entered a state of stagnation. Judging from the current state, the future of the cotton market will be difficult to develop in the short term. Today, only peer banks purchased 200 pieces of Pingguoer at a price of 75.5 yuan, with banknotes delivered at the warehouse. The source of Su Bei cotton was also declining, and only 63 bales of Tonghua cotton arrived.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Autumn and Winter Fabrics: North-South Spot Sales Gradually Active; Eastern Goods Rise in the Morning, Fall in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot sales of white cloth on the market remained sluggish. When sales did occur, prices were generally loose and low. Fine cloth and fine twill each fell by 10-20 cents per piece, while coarse cloth fell by 5-10 cents per piece. Coarse twill maintained its original price due to the limited inventory. Spot sales of autumn and winter colored cloth, colored twill, and flannel from both northern and southern regions gradually showed activity, and sales prices were particularly firm. More than 2,000 pieces of blue cloth, plain and patterned straight goods, broadcloth, and satin were transacted yesterday for Nanjing and various ports along the Jinpu and Longhai Railways. Cantonese and Hong Kong merchants purchased more than 3,000 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, and broadcloth, as well as more than 400 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill. Merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan added more than 2,800 pieces of colored cloth, patterned cloth, patterned flannel, and khaki. More than 1,500 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, printed cloth, satin, and fine cloth were purchased from Xinghua port and Taizhou in northern Jiangsu. Shipments from Tianjin in the north have been quite active in recent days. However, past orders have absorbed a large quantity, so they are temporarily focused on delivery, and new transactions are lacking. Wholesale shops in this district only have scattered replenishment business.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>The sales prices of fine cloth and fine twill in the morning market continued to rise, and the upward trend was strong. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth was selling for $13.75 per piece. Later, news emerged that foreign banknotes were not circulating in the market, and the discount rate for Shanghai banknotes rose sharply. Dealers in Wood Street were suddenly stunned, and the market softened again. "Dragon Head" spot prices fell to $13.60, with the current month at $13.70 and the next month at $14.00, still an increase of 10 cents per piece compared to last week's prices. In total, about 1,000 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill were transacted. The Eastern Cotton Mill continued to offer 200 bales of 12-pound flower fine cloth, which were ordered by dealers.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>On the 17th, 14 pieces of piece goods were exported to Tianjin. On the 18th, 65 pieces were exported to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Grains Sales Slightly Active, Flour Prices Quietly Loosen, Wheat Only Purchased by Japanese Merchants</h3>
<p>Flour Yesterday's spot flour transactions were slightly active. In addition to small-scale transactions by local and inland merchants, both northern and southern merchants showed interest. However, many frowned upon spot cash prices, as cash was scarce and discount rates for drafts remained high. Yesterday, returned "Fan" flour was selling for only $4.95 (draft price) in the market. It was rumored that some mills were also selling drafts, but it could not be confirmed, as local dealers still needed $4.65 in cash. In total, over 20,000 bags were transacted, mainly in small-scale transactions. The market outlook is becoming looser. Today, 4,000 bags were exported to Dagu.</p>
<p>Wheat The supply of wheat continued to arrive yesterday and the day before. In addition to some being put in warehouses, more and more were seeking to sell on the market. However, Chinese mills were not buying, Japanese mills had limited demand, and transshipment merchants rarely inquired, so the market was difficult to improve. Although buyers and sellers initially held their ground, the price eventually dropped by 1.5-1.6 cents, with Nanjing wheat selling for $6.25 and Pinghu wheat for $6.23, totaling over 400 bags, still purchased by Japanese merchants.</p>
<h3>Price Limits Reduced, Medium and Low Grade Thin Rice Rises Instead</h3>
<p>Du Geng Yesterday, the rice market announced that, in order to regulate food prices, the Public Concession and French Concession authorities, after convening representatives of the association for discussion, decided to continue to lower rice prices. Starting from July 15th, all transactions will be calculated based on the original transaction prices. The highest price for japonica rice should not exceed $20 (national currency) per stone, and the highest price for "Kejian" should not exceed $16 per stone. Other varieties are subject to separate arrangements. Transactions exceeding the price limits will not be recognized, and reports can be made to the police at any time for investigation and punishment to maintain food supply. Therefore, the market was still calm in the early morning, and the situation seemed weak. However, dealers in this district suddenly started buying cheaply, and the market gradually stabilized. As a result, the prices of thick japonica rice stabilized, while the prices of thin rice, except for high-quality rice, remained unchanged. The medium-grade rice was suitable for dealers, and the prices were raised by 2-3 cents. The spot sales of "Du Yangjian" and port rice were limited and the market was stable. In total, about 10,000 shi were sold, with the source of supply being 2,300-2,400 bags from He Xia and South Port merchants, as well as Changzhou and Fengjing.</p>
<p>Ke Xian Yesterday morning's market was sluggish and continued to fall. Later, the sales of "Gengjian" revived and improved. As "Rongxian" had lower prices, dealers focused on it. The subsequent sales were unexpectedly high, and market sentiment improved again. Except for old orders, where prices were still lowered by 1-2 cents, high-grade rice rose instead, with Nanjing Xian reaching $15.67 and Wuhu Xian reaching $15.45. The total daily turnover was more than 4,000 bags, mainly purchased by local dealers. Inland villages only made small purchases. The price limit for Xian rice should not exceed $16, which was announced and implemented yesterday.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Initial price of $21.50, later $21.70. A total of over 400 bags were sold in the market.</p>
<p>Bian Yuan The supply remained limited, and prices seemed to have bottomed out, so the market was stable and weak.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Yellow Beans Decline by Another 20-30 Cents</h3>
<p>Broad Beans High and Stable, Inferior Quality Soft</p>
<p>The market for miscellaneous grains was largely stagnant, weak, and with short-lived upticks due to various environmental factors. Yesterday, news spread that foreign banknotes were not circulating, which further hindered transactions in the market. Credit was tight, and purchasing power was weak, so prices frequently declined. Yellow bean prices fell by another 20-30 cents. Three cars of Dalian Sipingjie beans were priced at $9.80 for warehouse goods, and $9.70-$9.65 for goods from outside warehouses. The destination was inland markets. In addition, local merchants purchased 400 bags of Hankou Zha beans for $8.70-$8.65, and over 50 bags of Pudong Du beans for $11.35 for extra-large grains, $10.03 for medium grains, and $9.80 for ordinary grains. There was some interest in trading broad beans, so the market was generally high and stable, but lower quality beans weakened. Yesterday, over 700 bags of Wujiang green-skinned broad beans were transacted for $6.05-$6.00, 300 bags of Maojiashi green-skinned broad beans for $6.65, and $7.00 delivered, and 50 bags of Nanxiang green-skinned broad beans for $6.30.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Domestic Sugar Shows Signs of Slight Recovery</h3>
<p>According to London telegrams, the sugar market recently rose one point for August, to 7 shillings and 2.5 pence, slightly down by 0.25 for December, to 6 shillings and 2.725 pence, and unchanged for March of next year. The trend of the local association's pricing was stable. No. 24 coarse white sugar was still priced at its original level. Transshipment goods were at $20.80, with 100 bags transacted. Taikoo car white sugar also showed little change. B mark West warehouse was at $30.60, with 50 bags transacted. East warehouse called for a price, DJ mark at $29.45, 100 bags. Dutch red sugar was slightly down by 1-2 cents, with spot goods at $22 and transshipment goods at $16.10. It was rumored that domestic sugar shipments from Shantou would be transported by Japanese ships. If so, the supply would not be cut off for long. Therefore, merchants from Guangdong and Fujian both lowered their prices, as sales have been very limited recently, and merchants have been hesitant to aggressively buy.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Raw Silk Telegrams Report Price Increases, Zhili Silk Slightly Traded</h3>
<p>There was no market in New York on Sunday. Yokohama spot price was 1,250 yen, recent price was 1,224 yen, and forward price was 1,160 yen, an increase of 3-11 yen compared to last week's closing prices. The impact of overseas silk sales on the local market remained weak, mainly due to the dumping of Chinese silk by a certain party in Europe and America. This party was selling Shanghai white filature 7/8 at eight cents to one dime lower than that of Shanghai foreign merchants in New York. Therefore, although a portion of spring cocoons has arrived in Shanghai, the future of Chinese silk seems difficult to develop smoothly before the victory of the war.</p>
<p>In the local silk market, the telegraph price of Shanghai white filature was $2,220, but no transaction was made. The Xinfu and other firms purchased 180 piculs of Zhili grade six silk for $1,220, which can be considered strong. There were small transactions of native silk in Indian firms, with prices fixed and unchanged.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports Many Goods Arrive from Ningbo</h3>
<p>Among the goods arriving in Shanghai, there were 1,825 tins of tung oil from Tianjin, and 850 pieces of soybean oil from Yantai. More goods arrived from Ningbo, including 12 pieces of tobacco leaves, 120 pieces of leather oil, and 1,690 pieces of native paper.</p>

<h3>Banknotes with North China Place Names No Longer Accepted in Shanghai Yesterday To Prevent Japanese and Puppet Regimes from Transporting Funds to Acquire Foreign Exchange, China and Communications Banks Have Reported to Headquarters by Telegram</h3>
<p>In order to prevent the transport of legal tender with Tianjin place names to Shanghai for the purpose of buying foreign exchange, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have had to impose certain restrictions on banknotes with Tianjin place names. However, a small number will still be exchanged as usual. It is reported that the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have reported to headquarters and requested instructions. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Total Amount of Tianjin Banknote Issuance As of June 17th of this year, the amount of Tianjin banknotes issued totaled $162,233,100 by the Bank of China, $78,500,000 by the Bank of Communications, $36,592,505 by the Central Bank, $1,500,000 by the Four Banks, $1,750,000 by the China Industrial Bank, $1,500,000 by the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, $90,000 by the China Reclamation Bank, $20,000 by the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, $56,000 by the Dazhong Bank, and $50,000,000 by the Hebei Provincial Bank.</p>
<p>Temporary Restrictions to Prevent Transport Starting yesterday, banks and money shops in Shanghai refused to accept banknotes with Tianjin place names. At the same time, stores, companies, and cigarette shops refused to accept banknotes with North China place names, including Tianjin, Shandong, Beijing, Qingdao, Jinan, Weihaiwei, and Yantai, resulting in many rumors in the market. A reporter from the New Life News Agency learned from relevant sources that the legal tender of the Central Bank and the Farmers Bank of China does not have place names, so it is uniformly accepted throughout the country. In order to prevent the transport of legal tender with Tianjin place names from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications for the purpose of buying foreign exchange, certain restrictions have had to be imposed.</p>
<p>Small Number Still Exchanged as Usual The Shanghai branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications still exchange a small number of banknotes with Tianjin place names as usual. It is also reported that the exchange rate between Shanghai and Tianjin is 1,300 Tianjin legal tender to 1,000 Shanghai legal tender. At the same time, the black market exchange rate in Shanghai is six and a half pence for the British pound, while the exchange rate in Tianjin is only five pence. Therefore, unscrupulous merchants transport legal tender with Tianjin place names from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to Shanghai, exchange it for legal tender with Shanghai place names, and buy foreign exchange on the black market. The purpose of this restriction on exchange is to prevent the transport of legal tender with Tianjin place names to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Report to Headquarters and Request Instructions It is also reported that in addition to imposing restrictions on exchange, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have reported the situation to headquarters and requested instructions. This restriction is a temporary measure and is not related to the entire Chinese monetary system. As for the issuance of Chinese legal tender, its reserve fund and cash have always been above 60%, and the guarantee is below 40%. The high cash reserve is the highest among all countries. The issuance of legal tender during the war has been extremely cautious and has never relied on a paper money policy, which has already been proven by facts and does not need to be repeated.</p>
<p>No Need to Panic or Doubt About the Stability of Legal Tender After the news of refusing to accept legal tender with North China place names spread throughout the city, citizens who were not aware of the truth could not help but be surprised and doubtful. According to news from the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, the banks still accept banknotes with North China place names if they only account for 8-9 yuan out of every 100 yuan. If the amount is larger, they will be refused. This measure is neither a formal refusal nor a change in the Chinese legal tender system. It is an automatic measure to sanction unscrupulous merchants. As for the entire legal tender, the reserves are sufficient. The government has always maintained the statutory price of the legal tender exchange rate of one shilling and two and a half pence, which is evident. Therefore, citizens do not need to be alarmed.</p>
<p>Small Circulation in Shanghai After all industries in Shanghai refused to accept banknotes with North China place names, various sectors were concerned about whether this move would affect finance. According to a financial magnate, although banks in Shanghai used to accept banknotes with North China place names, the number circulating in Shanghai was small. Citizens who held these banknotes mostly exchanged them for Shanghai place names. Although the number of banknotes with North China place names in the market has increased recently, most of them are owned by unscrupulous people. Therefore, refusing to accept them will not cause any loss to citizens, and the entire financial system will not be affected.</p>
<h3>After the Circulation of Interbank Drafts, Check the Amount of Guarantee; The Balance of the Drawdown Account Can Be Used as an Overdraft for the Draft Handled by Each Bank and Industry Through Consultation</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance restricted withdrawals, the banking and money industries have been handling interbank drafts to stabilize the market and assist industry and commerce. The Money Exchange Association has begun to evaluate, implement inspections, and announce the interest rates on interbank drafts and draft deposits. In order to facilitate commercial turnover, each bank and money shop is allowed to use the balance of the drawdown account to offset an equal amount of overdraft for the draft. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Separate Meetings After the Joint Bank Reserve Committee handled the interbank drafts for each bank and money shop, it hired experts to organize an evaluation committee, divided into real estate, securities, and goods groups. The chairmen of the three groups, Qian Xinzhi, Bei Songsun, and Tang Qimin, respectively convened representatives of each bank and money shop to propose the prices of prepared properties and stipulated that the amount of interbank drafts used by each bank and money shop should not exceed 70% of the evaluated amount of the guarantee. If the market price falls, the guarantee may be recovered at any time.</p>
<p>Implementation of Inspections After the five groups, namely the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, the Money Exchange Association, the Foreign Banks Association, and the China, Communications, Agriculture, and Farmers' Four Banks, each sent a representative to form the Shanghai Banking and Money Industries Interbank Draft Preparation Inspection Committee, the committee decided to implement inspections at the end of July. The types and amounts of collateral for each bank and money shop's interbank draft preparation will be announced at any time to demonstrate credibility. Personnel have been dispatched by the Bank Reserve Committee to assist in handling the affairs of the Inspection Committee. As for the prepared properties for each bank and money shop's interbank drafts, they will be managed by the Custody Committee.</p>
<p>Various Interest Rates The Joint Bank Reserve Committee announced that in order to set the various interest rates of the committee from July 17th, any changes will be announced later. The interest rate for official bills is 2.8 cents per thousand yuan per day in national currency, the interest rate for drafts is 2.5 cents per thousand yuan per day, the discount rate for accepted drafts with a 90-day term is 2.8 cents in national currency, and the discount rate for drafts is 2.5 cents. The interest on interbank drafts used is 2.1 cents per thousand yuan per day, and the interest on interbank draft deposits is 0.5 cents less than the interest on interbank drafts used, which is 1.6 cents per thousand yuan per day. In addition, the interest owed on interbank draft loans made by the association before July 4th is 2.5 cents per thousand yuan per day.</p>
<p>Drawdown Balance Offset A reporter from the New Life News Agency learned from the banking industry that the Shanghai Hardware Industry Association has difficulties in operating due to the restrictions on withdrawals by the Ministry of Finance's Ma Telegram. Therefore, it is suggested to use the drawdown balance deposited in the bank to offset an equal amount of overdraft for the draft, that is, to repay the draft overdraft at any time with the income from the draft, in order to facilitate commerce. After the Bankers' Association consulted the opinions of various banks, it was heard that each bank considers the suggestion to be very thoughtful for the purpose of facilitating commercial turnover. However, it can only be handled more simply by each bank and the merchants in the industry who have dealings with each other through consultation.</p>
<h3>Anti-British Movement Begins in Various Villages in Jiangwan Listing Anti-British and Anti-Communist in the Same Breath; Obvious Planning in the Launching and Instigation</h3>
<p>The China Press reported that in many villages in Jiangwan, under the instigation of the Youth League in the city center, a major anti-British movement began on Saturday and Sunday. According to the New Shen Bao, the league was established only about a month ago and has renewed its efforts to "expand" the organization of the anti-British movement. The rally held in Jiangwan on Saturday and Sunday shouted anti-British slogans and distributed leaflets of the same nature, attacking the British and communists. The last slogan meant that the spirit of self-government of Shanghai youth is developing. These people want to establish a political affairs office in Jiangwan, similar to those existing in Pudong and other places. The demonstrators issued a lengthy proclamation calling the British "cunning" and lacking "international credibility."</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Caohijing Search House by House</h3>
<p>According to people from Caohijing in western Shanghai, the local Japanese troops recently received reports that a large number of guerrillas had infiltrated the area, causing them extreme panic. Therefore, they went to the countryside to search house by house and interrogate them strictly with the puppet "police" the other day. Three Hakka men, all coolies, were arrested because they had not obtained a residence permit from the "police station." They were deemed to be suspected and were detained and imprisoned in the Japanese military headquarters.</p>
<h3>Japanese Buddhist Monks Induce Chinese Children</h3>
<p>Japanese Buddhist monks from Nagasaki have come to China across the sea in large numbers. After arriving in China, they went to various occupied areas to pray for the souls of Japanese soldiers who died in China. At the same time, they also took the name of helping poor Chinese children, and tried to take in poor children between the ages of six and ten, teach them Japanese and Buddhist scriptures, and then take them back to Japan to increase their population after they were assimilated. This kind of work is carried out by Japanese monks in the areas where the Japanese army is stationed on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. The "Japanese Buddhist Joint Association" has been generally established in various places to induce Chinese children to join.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Flies to England Huge Loan Will Be Completed Song Still in Hong Kong, Ready to Go to England Britain Plans to Lend China 10 Million Pounds</h3>
<p>Since China's two years of resistance, the economic structure has been consolidated, and the legal tender exchange rate has always been maintained. International credibility has increased. Now, the United Kingdom and the United States have decided to continue to provide economic assistance. Song Ziwen is preparing to fly to England, and Chen Guangfu is staying in the United States. China will soon receive a huge loan, and the entire financial system will improve. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Legal Tender Exchange Rate Always Maintained After China implemented the currency reform policy, the entire financial system gained a solid foundation. Although the war has been extended for two years, the 60% cash reserve of legal tender has increased without decreasing. The exchange rate of one shilling and two and a half pence has always been maintained. Recently, in order to strengthen foreign exchange management, although there have been changes in the settlement methods for imports and exports, the exchange rate difference for exporters and the balancing fee for importers are still calculated based on the statutory exchange rate.</p>
<p>Great Benefits for Foreign Businessmen The smooth implementation of China's legal tender policy is due to the joint cooperation of the national financial community and compliance with laws and regulations, but the United Kingdom and the United States have also provided considerable assistance to China, such as the United States' purchase of Chinese silver, a $25 million loan to China, and the United Kingdom's loan to China and the establishment of a £10 million stabilization fund to stabilize the foreign exchange market and consolidate the legal tender foundation. Therefore, foreign businessmen operating in the Far East, whether directly or indirectly, have received great benefits.</p>
<p>Song Ziwen is Still in Hong Kong According to a message from the Shanghai financial community, the Bank of China Chairman, Mr. Song Ziwen, flew from Hong Kong to London, England. His mission is important, and its purpose is to contact the British financial community, increase loans to China, and strengthen the international credibility of legal tender and balance foreign exchange rates. However, as of yesterday afternoon, Mr. Song was still in Hong Kong. The Shanghai financial community has not received a telegram that Mr. Song has left Hong Kong for England, but it is understood that Mr. Song has prepared to go to England. It is difficult to predict when he will travel.</p>
<p>China Will Receive a Huge Loan The development of the $25 million loan from the US Export Bank to China last year has been very satisfactory, according to Mr. Pearson, the president of the bank. Therefore, a new loan to China is very likely. As for the UK loan to China, it is also in progress, with a total amount of about 10 million pounds. According to general speculation, China will continue to receive new loans from British and American giants in the near future.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ships Sail as Scheduled</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army landed in Shenjiamen and Dinghai last month, all foreign ships sailing between Dinghai and Ningbo have been forced to stop. The Swedish Ruifeng Company's Xinanli ship once tried to resume sailing on the 6th of this month, but was intercepted and turned back by a Japanese warship. It is now reported that in order to dominate shipping rights, the Japanese have organized the "Daxing Company" and the Hainan Company, and sent the Japanese ships Baiwumaru and Yangtze River to set sail for Dinghai, Wan Daitian, and Shenjiamen at 4:00 p.m. today. However, it is not yet certain whether they can achieve their goals.</p>
<h3>New Price Limits Implemented in the Rice Industry It is Heard that the Price Will Continue to Be Lowered Yesterday Morning's Transactions Were All Below the New Price Limit It Was Resolved to Rescue Husi According to the Previously Determined Method</h3>

All transactions were below the new price limits, that is, the highest price for japonica rice should not exceed $20 per stone, and the highest price for Xian rice should not exceed $16 per stone. Transactions exceeding the price limits will not be recognized, and reports can be made to the police at any time for investigation and punishment.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Foreign Rice Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since rice prices have soared, foreign rice has taken the opportunity to become active. Various foreign rice merchants in the city have ordered rice from Vietnam and Siam. It is now reported that the first batch of 700 tons of foreign rice ordered by Dafu Foreign Company in Saigon has been shipped. It was transported by the Italian ship Cortellazzo and entered the port at 3:30 p.m. yesterday, docked at Qichang Pier in Pudong to unload.</p>
<p>Soybean and Rice Association Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee Meeting The Soybean and Rice Association held a regular meeting of the Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Committee members Zhu Zixiang, Chen Ziyi, Cai Yukun, Xing Zhigang, Fu Qian'geng, Yang Heqing, etc. were present. Xing Zhigang was elected as the temporary chairman. First, Chen Ziyi reported on the situation of negotiating with Deputy Director He of the Public Concession's Bureau of Public Works to lower rice prices. Then, Fu Qian'geng, the director of the market management committee, reported on the market trading situation yesterday. The discussion of various cases then began. Regarding the Husi's request for relief, it was resolved to handle it according to the previously determined relief method.</p>
<p>Authorities Will Continue to Lower Prices New rice from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces will soon be on the market, and there is hope for a bumper harvest. At the same time, the rice reserves in Shanghai are sufficient, and rice prices will not rise again. It is reported that the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession will continue to lower rice prices in conjunction with rice industry organizations in order to maintain food supply. In addition, 6,000 bags of No. 1 foreign rice commissioned by miscellaneous grain merchants to Dafu Foreign Company in Saigon have arrived in port.</p>
<h3>Health Education Movement Successfully Concluded Children's Health Competition Judged Inspection Situation Notified to Families</h3>
<p>In order to promote public awareness of health and improve health, the YMCA held a Health Education Movement Publicity Week for one week starting on the 10th. It was officially concluded on the evening of the 16th. As for the Children's Health Competition, a total of 220 people registered, and 138 people actually participated in the physical examination. Yesterday, the hired doctors Shen Zhenghua, Sun Daming, Sun Binyu, Zhen Huikang, Su Huixiang, Shou Wuqing, Wu Hengzhen, and Xu Shuzhen were judged separately. There were 19 A+, 9 A, 56 A-, 7 B+, 23 B, 11 B-, 7 C, 1 D, and 5 unranked. In order to enable the children's families to improve the children's physical defects, the association notified their parents of the inspection situation, and also drafted maintenance and medical methods for those with diseases, so that they can develop healthy bodies.</p>

<h3>Six Days Adrift at Sea: A Story of Renewed Life</h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports: A Chinese fisherman from Nanao Island, near Shantou, encountered pirates over a week ago. He was robbed and thrown into the sea. Fortunately, he clung to a bamboo raft. After drifting for six days, his clothes were torn to shreds by the waves, and he suffered greatly from hunger and cold. However, on Friday, he was rescued by the American mail steamer "President Pierce." Yesterday (the 16th), he disembarked in Shanghai and was taken to the President Lines office on Guangdong Road, where he was questioned.</p>
<p>Overjoyed</p>
<p>He was dressed in neat American Western-style clothing and carried two suitcases filled with fine American garments. Moreover, his pockets were filled with US dollars, generously given to him by passengers of the "President Pierce." His joy was undoubtedly boundless. Little is known about the fisherman, as he speaks the Nanao dialect, which no one understands. Several people tried to interpret his words, but to no avail. Furthermore, he is illiterate and does not speak any other coastal languages or English. However, after much effort, it was learned that his boat had been</p>
<p>Seized by Pirates</p>
<p>And he had been thrown overboard. The "President Pierce" rescued him at 23.40 degrees north latitude and 118 degrees east longitude. At the time of his rescue, he was naked and severely weakened by the storm. After eating on board, his strength quickly recovered. The passengers, moved by his plight, showed him great sympathy. As the President Lines staff could not fully understand his experiences, they decided to take him to several Shantou hotels in the city last night to have his words deciphered. He will now be</p>
<p>Carried to Hong Kong</p>
<p>By the "President Coolidge" to return to his hometown on Nanao Island. According to inquiries made by a reporter last night, the President Lines staff, after taking him to a Shantou hotel, discovered his name, age, and details of his unfortunate experience. The fisherman's name is Wu Ying (transliteration), and he is only twenty-seven years old. He and six other fishermen were robbed by pirates while sailing. He was thrown into the sea and drifted for six days. The fate of his companions is unknown. The "President Pierce," fully loaded with cargo and passengers, was sailing to Shanghai and Japan. Sixteen hours after departing from Hong Kong, the fisherman was spotted by the ship's watchtower and rescued. He was treated in the ship's infirmary, causing the mail steamer to be</p>
<p>Delayed by One Hour</p>
<p>It is scheduled to leave Shanghai today (the 17th), heading to various ports on the Pacific coast via Japan.</p>
<h3>New US Fleet Commander Rear Admiral Hepburn Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow Afternoon; Admiral Yarnall Arrives Today From Qingdao; Change of Command Ceremony Next Week</h3>
<p>Rear Admiral Hepburn, the new commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, arrived in China on July 5th aboard the President Coolidge of the Dollar Steamship Company from Honolulu with his family to assume his new post. It is now known that the ship is scheduled to arrive at the port at 2 PM tomorrow (the 19th), and the new commander will disembark at</p>
<p>Customs Wharf around 4 PM. The ship will be berthed at buoys eleven and twelve. At that time, US Consul General Gauss, Captain Fegen of the Fourth Naval District, Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the US Yangtze Patrol, and outgoing Admiral Yarnall, arriving from Qingdao, will</p>
<p>Welcome Rear Admiral and Mrs. Hepburn. According to US naval sources, Admiral Yarnall left for North China on June 8th and has been cruising for four weeks. Admiral Yarnall departed from Qingdao on the 17th aboard the flagship Augusta and is scheduled to</p>
<p>Arrive in Shanghai today. After Rear Admiral Hepburn has rested briefly, the change of command ceremony is scheduled to take place on the Augusta flagship next Tuesday (the 25th). It is reported that after Admiral Yarnall relinquishes his post, he will engage in some socializing in Shanghai and pack his belongings before urgently returning home, first to Washington to report to President Roosevelt. President Roosevelt, recognizing Admiral Yarnall's many meritorious achievements during his tenure, will personally present Admiral Yarnall with a medal.</p>
<h3>Stealing Half a Day: Collective Report</h3>
<p>Two: Joy and Sorrow</p>
<p>On the roads, everyone must pay attention to "safety first." In the Zhaofeng Park, however, visitors don't seem to worry about this at all.</p>
<p>You see, there are men, women, old and young, some walking arm in arm, shoulder to shoulder; some holding onto each other's sleeves, looking around as they walk; others are solitary visitors, alone, circling the park. They possess the spirit of the lone hero. But while being alone is good, being in pairs or groups is even better. Their walking postures are always staggered, with varying speeds. It's rare to see "little angels" walking straight or diagonally, marching properly.</p>
<p>Several of us originally planned to meet by the pond. As soon as I entered the park, I headed straight for the pond. I saw a gentlemanly man, around fifty years old, carrying a toy sailboat in his right hand, held under his arm. The boat was over three feet long, with three triangular sails. Seeing this scene, I thought of the owner of the sailboat. As I was looking around, I suddenly heard hurried footsteps behind me, and the sound of "Daddy..." carried by the wind. The innocence, sincerity, and joy were fully expressed in the simplest two words a son uses to call his father.</p>
<p>It was a father and son. They had reached the pond before me. The old man gently released the sailboat into the water for its "launching ceremony," and the little one clapped and cheered, once again exclaiming "Daddy!" They circled the pond. In this miniature space, I discovered several different types of visitors. For example, in the northwest corner, on a low mound overlooking the pond, there were several chairs placed close to the shade of the trees. A couple was already sitting side by side, whispering sweet nothings. With an attitude of "disinterest," I spied on their "uncontrollable" performance. In a "glimpse," I saw the woman slightly leaning forward, her back not touching the chair. Her eyes were fixed on the "river of love" at her feet. The man sitting next to her had his right arm resting on the back of the chair, giving her a pretend half-embrace. There was only the distance of a tongue between his mouth and her ear. Judging from their expressions, the man seemed to be explaining something in great detail, while the woman seemed to be answering sporadically, or perhaps not answering at all. Although I couldn't hear her words, her body language was full of silent messages like those in a silent movie.</p>
<p>Yesterday at noon, there was a slight drizzle. The raindrops were like wind to the ears of this couple, and they remained motionless. As I walked slowly, I saw a solitary foreign visitor. He was wearing a winter woolen hat, a worn-out navy blue serge short jacket, and trousers of a color that words cannot describe. His leather shoes, because they had not been polished for a long time, were dry and haggard, just like the complexion of their owner, six feet above them, both showing signs of "absolute frustration." Although this person was also being hit by raindrops, he sat still, staring blankly at the pond water, without any energy. But I couldn't bear to spy on him anymore. If sociologists in large cities want to compile "A Corner for the Poor," I can guarantee that they can get very real and rich experiences from his mouth. He is undoubtedly an unemployed person who is still breathing and demanding "survival." (Xiang Shi)</p>
<p>Bamboo Path</p>
<p>Pond</p>
<p>Three: Each with Their Own Interests</p>
<p>Mr. N disappeared into the depths of the woods, leaving Ming'er and me to wander by the pond, waiting for our agreed-upon friend.</p>
<p>The wind stirred the waves of the pond, and toy sailboats rose and fell in the rolling waves. An old man, over fifty years old, was playing with a slightly larger sailboat alone. Perhaps because the boat was too light, its two sails were raised high, losing its center of gravity, and its sailing was not smooth. Unable to withstand the invasion of the wind and waves, it suddenly capsized in the pond. Three foreigners came, carrying cameras, and aimed at the sailboat. But the boat repeatedly overturned in the water, and they finally failed to capture it in their lenses. The foreigners left disappointed, and the old man seemed to feel disappointed too, so he took the small sail and disappeared sadly by the pond.</p>
<p>A Western child was playing with a smaller sailboat, sailing quickly. Sometimes it drifted in the middle of the pond, and sometimes it sailed swiftly to the other shore. The child was busy running back and forth on both sides of the pond. The pond water and the sailboat became the bright world in the child's consciousness. Every spring and summer, Westerners in Shanghai go yachting on the Yangtze River, but now that Western child can enjoy the beautiful pond all by himself.</p>
<p>Mr. S, with a sense of humor, arrived late. He was sent to find Mr. N, while I continued to wander with Ming'er under the thatched pavilion at the right end of the pond. Ming'er saw the clean stone steps and insisted that I accompany her to jump up and down, walking back and forth. She seemed to have a special affection for the stone steps, more interested than the Western child's sailboat.</p>
<p>Walking along the bank of the pond to the other side, we suddenly met Brother Gu. And Mr. S also came. But Mr. N had not been found, and now only Brother Yan, nicknamed "Saraci," had not come. Mr. S and I searched for the missing Mr. N and strolled to another pond, where there was an earthen mound and tall buildings outside the garden, shielding it from the wind. The wind seemed smaller. Lotuses bloomed in the pond, and long fish swam in the green water. Unfortunately, there was not enough time to hold a fishing rod and fish. Wouldn't that be even more leisurely?</p>
<p>Crossing the small bridge, circling the pond, we returned to the original pond. Brother Gu was still chatting with his friends on the chairs. Mr. N also came, and we proposed that Mr. S take a photo. Mr. S first took two landscape photos by the pond, and everyone suggested going to the newly built small mountain.</p>
<p>The children were playing with small airplanes on the wide lawn. Coincidentally, a giant iron bird came in the sky. The children sat down on the ground, staring up at the iron bird in the sky. In their small consciousness, perhaps they had already flown their toy airplanes and caught up with the giant iron bird.</p>
<p>A group of girls were building a human pyramid on the music stage, and another girl was setting up a tripod to take pictures.</p>
<p>Young men and women were hiding on chairs in the depths of the trees, talking about love. Obviously, visiting the park varied according to each person's age, consciousness, and thoughts.</p>
<p>People like us, who are so-called middle-aged or older, don't seem to have the courage to whisper sweet nothings. But this doesn't mean that people over middle age no longer talk about love; seeing a tree, a bridge, some flowers, lush forests and bamboo, and swimming birds and fish, seems more interesting. Mr. N suddenly stopped and said, "This place is spooky. Don't go in." Seeing the two stone horses and two stone figures in front of the door, I deeply</p>
<p>Curving and winding, we arrived at another secluded place. I felt that the environment was so harmonious. We strolled on the undulating lawn, and the newly planted bamboos had mostly been blown down by the wind and lay on the ground. The angles of the stone steps on both sides were very harmonious. Mr. N guessed that he wanted to go back. The sun was faintly hidden in the clouds, and with the wind carrying a few drops of rain, we walked out of the park. I took a few photos, my interest undiminished. Mr. N pressed the camera and took a close-up of the "mountain road." We crossed and walked to a low, old house called "Zhaofeng Village" under the shade of a large tree. Many tourists were eating there. Mr. S wanted to go in and take a look. "Stealing half a day" by visiting a park for two hours and writing a piece of "irrelevant resistance" is probably not a crime, right? (Zhi Zhi)</p>
<p>Four: Peace and Joy</p>
<p>The layout of this park is quite grand. The entire park uses trees as its bones, gravel roads as its veins, and lawns as its main body. It can be described as boundless and all green. Psychologists say that green represents peace and joy. Therefore, when visitors enter the park, they immediately feel refreshed, peaceful, and harmonious upon seeing the lawn.</p>
<p>People in the city, especially those in Shanghai, are constantly tense, busy with work, taking trams, riding elevators, and entering offices, busy all day long. The entertainment they provide is nothing more than indulging in food and drink at restaurants, dance halls, and movie theaters, with no time to spare. There are even merchants who bury themselves in their desks, holding counters and calculating all day long. If they take the time to walk on the lawn here, at least half of the anxiety in their minds can be reduced.</p>
<p>Banana trees are green, roses have not yet bloomed. South of the stone bridge in the west of the park, on the path to the zoo, hydrangeas are planted everywhere. North of the bridge, the flowerbeds are mostly herbaceous. I once visited the East Railway Club in Harbin and saw the green grass in front of the music stage, several inches high, with the four characters of the China Eastern Railway planted in red carnations, interwoven in the center of the grass, splendid and brilliant, looking like an expensive Turkish carpet from a distance, extremely magnificent. But it was too extravagant, stimulating the psychology of the visitors. Zhaofeng Park is different. It is a winner with its cleanliness and beauty.</p>
<p>Pine trees are shrubs, which do not wither in winter and remain green all year round. Their size is also quite large, making them most suitable for planting in parks. The Zhaofeng Park has needle-shaped pines, and the one by the pond is the most spectacular, towering like a canopy, looking like an exquisite pagoda from a distance. Looking closely, it is more than a foot around, with needles spread flat, layer upon layer. If you lie under the tree and look up at the scenery in the sky, it is like living deep in the white clouds, forgetting the noise outside.</p>
<p>The pine groves on the west side of the lawn are a great place for visitors to cool off. In the northwest corner, there is a grove that is smaller and denser, like a green gauze curtain. Young men and women often sit here knee to knee, whispering sweet nothings. When we pass by here, we can't help but think of this small paradise. We don't know how many loving couples who would rather be mandarin ducks than immortals have been created here, and we don't know how many young people have shed so many tears of passion here.

<h3>The Origin of Happiness Between Couples</h3>
<p>The reason why couples come together is nothing more than to pursue happiness in life. Although a solitary man or virgin can live a life of ease, they each feel a sense of lonely incompleteness in their heart. This incompleteness cannot be compensated with money or status. It must be filled with the person in their heart—their lover. There are many men and women in the world suffering from lovesickness, which causes them to wither, lose weight, and even age. However, as soon as the person in their heart arrives, their spirit and body are immediately restored. We don't need to use distant facts as metaphors. Just look at a couple who marries for love. Because their long-cherished wish has been fulfilled, they are mutually happy in body and mind, and a new interest in life arises. They will inevitably perk up their spirits in their studies and careers, work together with one heart, and move forward. How happy and meaningful this is!</p>
<p>However, in fact, there are also many married men and women whose bodies and minds decline, whose love is nonexistent, and who fall into the abyss of life's pain. What is the reason for this? According to medical judgment, it is mostly because men committed masturbation or nocturnal emission in their early years, or indulged in excessive licentiousness after marriage, consuming too much of the seminal fluid (semen) that governs sexual health. As a result, metabolism decreases, development stagnates, and the three major nerves of the brain, spinal cord, and sex organs weaken. When the sperm gate loosens, symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, thin sperm and infertility, and neurasthenia occur one after another. Such husbands often exhibit weakness and incompetence in their married life, or are completely unable to perform sexually. This not only sacrifices their wives' precious youth, but also causes their own hearts to ache. The happiness between couples is like a fleeting dream. After the dream, what remains is nothing more than the hideous face of a demon!</p>
<p>The only remedy, according to thousands of cases of famous doctors around the world and my many years of experience, is to take the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" (生殖素). This medicine can produce sperm, tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves within one day and night after taking it. Its effects are the same in summer as in winter. After continuing to take it for half a month, it can also promote development and regulate metabolism. The above-mentioned symptoms can be completely cured. Only those with spermatorrhea must also take "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (希米脫氏固精片) (available at Wing On, Sincere, Western medicine departments, and Wuzhou Sino-French pharmacies) to stop leakage and achieve rapid results!</p>
<p>Patient Zhao Xing, from Jiangning, is 31 years old. He suffered from severe premature ejaculation and impotence. He also had nocturnal emission during sleep. Last month, he sought treatment from me. I prescribed a large dose of "Sheng Zhi Su" and made him take it with "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian." In less than a week, the nocturnal emission stopped. Now, a month later, his body has completely recovered to perfect health. This is truly what is called "facts speak louder than words."</p>
<h3>Young Men with Spermatorrhea, Quickly Embark on the Path of Self-Renewal</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Specialist in Venereal Diseases</p>
<p>Opportunity will never wait for us; we must wait for opportunity. If opportunity is missed, even if we use all our strength, it may not come back. Then, regret is in vain!</p>
<p>Learning in youth and acting in adulthood are all special and important tasks in our various stages of life. Therefore, all young people must make great efforts to lay the foundation for our academic and career pursuits. The vastness of academic knowledge and the multitude of careers in the world mean that even if we devote our entire lives and strive to the utmost, we may still fall short. How much more so should we not waste the golden age of youth? However, while there are indeed awakened young people, there are also many who are not! For example, how many young people in the spring of their youth commit masturbation and licentiousness? Know that masturbation and licentiousness most easily damage the sexual nerves, causing the sperm gate to loosen, and the terrible disease of spermatorrhea then follows.</p>
<p>Semen is the source of our happiness and the element of life. Physiologically speaking, semen is gonadal fluid. In addition to being stored in the seminal vesicles specifically for the needs of love and reproductive function, its endocrine secretions can directly permeate the blood, irrigating the whole body and having the functions of regulating metabolism, promoting development, and nourishing the nerves. Now, if spermatorrhea is left untreated for a long time, the gonadal fluid will inevitably be depleted. Then, symptoms such as incomplete development, premature ejaculation, impotence, brain decay and forgetfulness, neurasthenia, and fear of cold and heat will follow. Such young people will not only be sinners in the love between men and women, affecting fertility and losing all happiness, but they will also miss the opportunity to study. Even if they are strong, they are already old, and are nothing more than decadent parasites in society!</p>
<p>The only remedy is to take "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (希米脫氏固精片), which is the most effective treatment. According to the evidence of famous doctors around the world and my many years of experience, this medicine can strengthen the sperm gate and calm the nerves after taking it, and it has the effect of curing spermatorrhea immediately. If you have the above-mentioned symptoms due to spermatorrhea, you must also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" (生殖素) to nourish the brain and kidneys and increase sperm and blood. Continuing to take it will surely restore perfect health in a short period of time. If the sufferer can come to this clinic for electrotherapy and injections, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>

<h3>A Passionate Woman Will Inevitably Have High, Erect Breasts</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, MD (USA)</p>
<p>Dr. Samaller, a famous American physiologist whom I had the pleasure of meeting once, once said: "A passionate woman will inevitably have high, erect breasts." Initially, his words aroused a lot of suspicion. Later, he wrote an article "Breasts and Love" published in a women's magazine. Only then did people understand why he said this, based on the fact that the development of a woman's breasts is entirely due to the strength of the gonadal ovarian function. Because gonadal ovarian function is the general hub of all the glands in women, if it can be healthy and strong, it will produce a large amount of endocrine secretions in the body. This endocrine secretion can promote the development of female characteristics. In terms of body shape, the most obvious thing is that the breasts are high and erect, and the nipples are sandalwood in color, like the top of a cone-shaped mountain. In addition, the hips must also be very plump, and the body will be graceful, forming a healthy, beautiful, and multi-faceted curve that is so intoxicating! In terms of emotions, due to the vigorous metabolism, they often appear lively, exquisite, quick-witted, and passionate. Such women, because of the gentleness and health and beauty of their character and physique, are praised by everyone in social interactions and are praised as social stars. And once they get married, they are also a typical virtuous wife and good mother, filling the family with joy. The husband respects her as a heavenly being. That is truly so glorious and gratifying. However, in the past, those who committed masturbation and chest binding, or had irregular menstruation, persistent leukorrhea, malnutrition, or serious illnesses, causing the gonadal ovarian function to be unhealthy, affecting breast development, would not only be sick and painful, lose their beauty, but also be disgusted by men, and even abandoned! The only remedy is to take the ovarian preparation for women, "Sheng Zhi Su" (生殖素), which is the most effective treatment. This medicine is made from the secretion of the gonads and ovaries of strong animals. Therefore, it can nourish the ovarian function, enhance metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus, and stop leukorrhea within one day and night after taking it. Continuing to take it will surely make the breasts high and erect, the hips plump, the cheeks rosy, and youth will last forever in a short period of time.</p>

<h3>The Reason for the Sudden Recurrence of Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>Many cases of gonorrhea appear to have been cured on the surface without the patient's awareness. However, upon closer examination, it cannot be said that these cases have been completely cured. On the contrary, this phenomenon is not a good sign, but rather a seed for future recurrence. Based on my many years of experience, once gonorrhea becomes chronic, patients often mistakenly believe they are cured. They then act recklessly, and when the virus suddenly erupts again, they are at a loss, wondering how they could have contracted "white turbidity" (a symptom of gonorrhea) without engaging in prostitution. They are truly like a perplexed monk. In reality, many of these patients took incorrect and inferior medications indiscriminately at the onset of gonorrhea, driving the toxins inward, or underwent poor surgical procedures that forced the gonococci to escape inward. This led to various secondary or concurrent complications. For example, in acute gonorrhea with white turbidity, the gonococci often cluster in the anterior urethra. At that time, the inflammation is severe, making local surgery impossible to perform, and even if oral medications have no side effects, they are too slow to be effective and do nothing to help. Moreover, delaying treatment and turning an acute condition into a chronic one only makes matters worse.</p>
<p>Therefore, the secret to a quick cure for gonorrhea lies in not taking over-the-counter medications privately, not undergoing surgery casually at facilities with mediocre equipment and shallow experience, and in the patient taking good care of their health. Then, use specially made autogenous vaccines to increase the body's resistance, while also taking chemotherapy and using German filtrate electrophoresis therapy to completely and directly eliminate gonococci hidden in the reproductive, urinary, and circulatory systems. In this way, any gonorrhea can be completely cured within a limited time.</p>

<h3>Hollywood Casino Employee Arrested for Impersonating Official in Extortion Scam</h3>
<p>Lei Yong (also known as Lei Wenkui), a native of Nanxiang, currently works at the Hollywood casino in western Shanghai. He was originally an employee of the Municipal Public Works Bureau. After the National Army retreated westward, he joined the casino and mingled with the likes of pig herders. As the saying goes, "one who touches ink becomes black," so Lei has also become increasingly depraved. Recently, under the guidance of a colleague surnamed Su at Hollywood, he forged a badge and hat emblem of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Engineering Department, using the alias "Gao." He printed business cards with the self-proclaimed title of "Special Inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Construction Department" at the bottom. Every day, in addition to serving his time at the casino, he would scout out factories, shops, and residential buildings with awnings or mezzanines in western Shanghai. Upon finding such constructions, he would pose as an inspector, using the pretext of inspecting building permits to extort money. Merchants, seeing his Western-style suit and conspicuous badge, dared not equate him with ordinary hooligans. Lei got his way, and since acquiring these two illegal sources of income, his coffers have swelled considerably. On the third day of last month, he learned that the Hu Xinji Thermos Factory at No. 636, Xiaoshadu Road, near his residence, had built a new awning in its courtyard. He immediately went to see the factory owner, Hu Xincai, and employed his usual tactics of intimidation and extortion, demanding to see the building permit. Hu had not applied for a permit for the awning, so he could not comply. He then pleaded with Lei to handle the matter. Lei initially demanded 35 taels of silver, but after repeated haggling, Hu was extorted 24 yuan in national currency. Unexpectedly, as soon as the fake inspector left, the real inspector arrived. Hu then realized he had been deceived and handed the card with Lei's alias "Gao" to the inspector, who took it back to the police station for investigation. Last Saturday, Hu was passing Kang Nao Road when he spotted Lei heading to the Hollywood casino. Hu immediately had him apprehended by a Chinese constable at No. 3088 and taken to the Gordon Road Police Station. After questioning, the police chief sent detectives to search Lei's home at No. 85, Lane 617, Xiaoshadu Road, where they found pre-war documents from the Shanghai Municipal Works Bureau, Lei's business cards with his fabricated title, over 90 yuan in cash, and a bank deposit book, all of which were brought back to the police station. Yesterday morning, Hu Xincai was summoned to escort Lei to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, stated that the defendant had impersonated an official to commit fraud and that the seized badges and other items were forged by the defendant. He also said that the bank deposits and cash needed to be investigated to determine whether they were obtained through fraud. He requested an adjournment of the case. Hu also recounted the circumstances of the defendant's impersonation and extortion. Judge Dai then examined the seized items one by one and questioned Lei. The suspect confessed to working at the Hollywood casino and admitted that the badge was purchased from a person surnamed Su in Chengdu Road and that he had offered to arrange a fake permit for Hu. As a result, he was ordered to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Oil Shop Robbery: Owner Shot</h3>
<p>Zhang Jinming, a 21-year-old native of Songjiang, runs the Tongxingyu Oil Shop in Jinshanwan, Songjiang County. At 8 a.m. the day before yesterday (the 16th), a bandit armed with a Mauser pistol broke into the shop and demanded 2,000 yuan in national currency from Zhang. Zhang replied that the small shop did not have such a large sum of money. The bandit then fired a shot, hitting Zhang in the right leg and exiting through the left leg. Zhang fell to the ground injured. The shop assistants, seeing the bandit fire, scattered and hid. The bandit then stole 100 yuan in national currency from the counter and drawers and fled. Afterward, Zhang was escorted to Shanghai and sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment at 7 p.m. last night.</p>
<h3>Russian Policeman Commits Suicide: Shot in the Chest, Dies on the Spot</h3>
<p>Ilangen Yigela, a 24-year-old Russian policeman in the French police force, joined the French police force as a Russian patrolman in April of this year. He had been fulfilling his duties for several months. However, at around 5 p.m. yesterday, while on duty at Pier No. 1 on the Bund in the French Concession, he suddenly shot himself in the chest with his own pistol. After the incident, police officers rushed to the scene and investigated. Because the injury was to a vital area, he died shortly after. A suicide note addressed to his mother was found near the policeman, containing mostly negative and world-weary sentiments.

<h3>High-Heeled Shoes Cause Fatal Fall: Ms. Wang's Accidental Death, Autopsy Waived, Funeral Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wang Yilu, a 20-year-old woman from Jiading residing at No. 6, Tingyunfang, Fulili Road, is the younger sister of Wang Yihui, the current female clerk of the Civil Local Court of the Second Special Court. Her father works in the Judicial Administration Department. Wang Yilu graduated from high school this summer and planned to enter Aurora University next semester. At around 7 p.m. on the 15th of this month, she and her two sisters, Wang Yide and Wang Yicong, went to deliver photos to a classmate's home at No. 39, Xilong, Jianye Lane, on the same road. Yilu went upstairs alone, while Yide and Yicong waited at the back entrance. After about five minutes, Yilu came downstairs to go home. While descending the stairs in high-heeled shoes, she accidentally fell and fainted due to a concussion. Her two sisters rushed to help her up, but she could not speak. They immediately called an ambulance and sent her to the Red Cross General Hospital on Haig Road, but she died before receiving treatment. As usual, the hospital reported the death to the French police, and the family took the body to the funeral home for preparation. However, after the police dispatched detectives to investigate according to regulations, they prepared an official document and reported it to the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special Court yesterday to request an autopsy. The deceased's sister, Wang Yihui, requested the Prosecutor's Office to waive the autopsy. Prosecutor Wang Ren approved the waiver on the autopsy form, stating that the case had been investigated by the Police Department and the family had stated that the death was due to an accidental fall. The autopsy was waived, and Wang Yihui was allowed to collect the body for burial.</p>

Chen Yuemei usually does not study diligently. Previously, she failed an exam and was held back a grade. A few days ago, her father received a report from the school stating that the student's summer exam performance was poor and she was being held back. After reading the report, he scolded Yuemei slightly. Afterward, Yuemei was unhappy. Suddenly, at around 2 p.m. yesterday, she secretly swallowed a large bottle of medicine in an attempt to commit suicide. Later, her family discovered it and quickly hired a car to send her to the hospital for treatment. She was severely poisoned and her life is in danger.</p>

<h3>Taoist Priest Turns Bandit: Robs Fortune-Telling Shop, Sentenced</h3>
<p>Wang Xingbao, a local man residing at No. 147, Li Mei Road in the French Concession and previously a Taoist priest, gathered Qiu Sanzi from Jiangbei and a person nicknamed "Rotten Wood" (still at large) on the 22nd of last month. They carried pistols and sharp blades to the home of Wang Wenlong, the blind owner of a fortune-telling shop at No. 46, Li Mei Road, and committed robbery. At the time, they stole nine pieces of clothing. Not satisfied, the Taoist Wang sent a threatening letter on the 24th of the same month, extorting 500 yuan and specifying that he would meet on Gansu Road in the Public Concession the next morning at 7 a.m. After receiving the letter, Wang reported it to the Songshan Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives to the address and apprehended the two men, Wang and Qiu, on the spot. They were taken to the police station and transferred to the court. The trial has concluded, and yesterday Wang Xingbao and Qiu Sanzi were each sentenced to four years and six months of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Huitong Bank Closes: Limited Deposits and Loans, Minimal Losses to Outside Parties</h3>
<p>The Huitong Bank at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Beijing Road in this city was founded by Fan Liang. It engaged in the business of buying and selling drafts, British and American gold pounds, gold certificates, securities, and deposits and loans. Fan served as the manager himself. Unexpectedly, Fan suddenly died of illness on the 5th of this month. Because no one was in charge, the bank announced the suspension of business on the day of Fan's death (the 6th). The bank has now appointed accountant Jiang Wanping to formally announce the closure and liquidate the accounts. Jiang issued a public notice stating, "According to Fan Chen Xiu Yun, the legal heir and spouse of the late Mr. Fan Shaoliang, and his son, Changhua, Mr. Fan passed away due to illness on July 5th. As a result, the Huitong Bank he operated cannot continue to operate. Therefore, we have specially commissioned your accounting firm to represent us in announcing the closure and liquidating the accounts in order to conclude the business. We hereby legally entrust and represent to notify all creditors to bring their debt certificates to our office for registration within two weeks. Failure to do so will be considered a waiver of the claim. All debtors are also requested to submit the principal and interest owed to this accounting firm within the same period to complete the formalities. This is hereby announced." It is reported that the bank's business focused on the buying and selling of securities and foreign currencies. Because its credit was not reliable, there were limited deposits and loans, so there were minimal losses to outside parties.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Suffers Stroke and Dies on the Street</h3>
<p>Li Afu, a 41-year-old native of Tongzhou, worked as a rickshaw puller at the Ningbo Tangzi (lodging house) run by Mrs. Ye Dong (55), a Ningbo native, at No. 10, Fubaoli, Liuma Road. At 3:45 p.m. on the 15th, Mrs. Ye was riding in the rickshaw pulled by Li when he suddenly collapsed due to a stroke in front of the Dahou Hotel on Dongxin Bridge, Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, while heading west. Mrs. Ye also fell out of the rickshaw. When she got up and looked, Li was already dead. A police officer arrived and reported it to the police station. The police dispatched detectives to investigate and transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch morgue, notifying the deceased's younger brother, Li Linbao. Yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special Court examined the body and confirmed that the death was due to illness. The deceased's younger brother signed a statement to claim the body for burial. However, because the family was poor and unable to afford it, the employer provided funds to purchase clothing and a coffin for burial and transport back to their hometown.</p>

At 1 p.m. on the 16th, Wang went to the Gongtai Freight Company at No. 12, New Market Road, Fujian Road, to purchase watermelons. While Wang was selecting watermelons, he accidentally poked a hole in one with his finger. Tang Wenjun, a Shanghai native and employee of the freight company, questioned Wang, saying that since he had poked a hole in the watermelon, he had to buy the whole load. Wang argued that if the watermelon was not rotten, it would not have been pierced so easily and that he could not be forced to buy a rotten watermelon. As a result, the two sides argued and then fought. Wang was severely beaten by Tang and others. After returning home, he suffered severe abdominal pain. His family reported it to the Laochan Police Station, and Chinese detective Qiu Sijiu rushed to the scene, arrested Tang, and sent Wang Liansheng to Renji Hospital. Doctors found that Wang's intestines were ruptured and immediately performed surgery to sew them back together. If the fever does not increase again, his life may be saved, but there is fear that he may not survive. Yesterday morning, Tang was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the circumstances, stating that it was not yet known what damage had been done to Wang Liansheng's life and requesting an adjournment of the case. After Judge Xiao Xieyin questioned him, he ordered Tang to be remanded in custody for a rescheduled hearing.</p>

<p>Due to the recent hot weather, the Shengji Billiard Factory behind Kangjia Bridge in western Shanghai has been stopping work during the day and switching to night work. At around 9 p.m. the night before last (the 16th), workers were working in the factory when one of them discarded a lit cigarette butt into a basket of billiard balls. Because the raw materials for billiard balls are mainly rosin, a fire broke out immediately. Coupled with strong winds, the fire spread to the reed mat shed, causing a massive blaze. The area is located in the Chinese territory and there is no fire brigade. The workers tried to extinguish the fire, but the entire factory shed was reduced to ashes, resulting in considerable losses.</p>

<h3>Misuse of Reuters Name: "New Shen Bao" Corrected</h3>
<p>Reuters, 17th Local News: Reuters and the Shanghai Japanese organ New Shen Bao, previously had a dispute because the newspaper published a news item, falsely claiming that it was issued by Reuters, has been resolved. The New Shen Bao has now published a correction, stating that the news was not from Reuters. It is reported that the Japanese Consul-General warned the New Shen Bao not to misuse the Reuters name after communicating with the British Consul-General. The original text of the correction published by the New Shen Bao is as follows: "Correction: The news item 'Ambassador Cole Arrives in Chongqing' published on the front page of this newspaper on April 22nd, which stated 'According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 19th,' was an error. We hereby correct it." This news item, which appeared in the New Shen Bao on April 22nd, falsely claimed to be a Reuters Chongqing dispatch and stated that internal conflicts within the Nationalist government were now deepening and that the British Ambassador's visit to Chongqing in April was based on the instructions of the British government to kindly warn the Nationalist government to begin peace negotiations with Japan.</p>
<h3>This Morning Gunfire West of Shanghai: Sounds Like Rifle Fire, Reason Unknown</h3>
<p>Around 1:20 AM this morning, at a bridge approach on the Western Outer Ring Road of Shanghai, approximately five or six gunshots were exchanged, sounding like mutual fire. Upon careful listening, the gunshots seemed to resemble those of rifles. Whether it was a shootout between police and bandits, or gunfire from one side only, and whether there were any casualties on either side, is unknown because it was late at night and the area is on an extraterritorial road, making investigation impossible. More details will be provided later. The location is about two hundred yards from the concession.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of my client, Mr. Hong Xiaogang, who claims that upon reading a news item in your newspaper, the facts presented therein were not entirely accurate. Upon investigation, I found that my client had rented his surplus rooms to Shao Yizhou for residential purposes. However, Shao Yizhou later established a "classroom" (課壇) there and frequently burned paper money and beat large gongs late at night. My client, considering this to be disturbing the peace and security of the other residents, advised him against it, which led to resentment. Around 2:00 PM on June 30th, when my client's wife requested the rent, Shao Yizhou not only refused to pay but also assaulted her. Although my client's sister reported the incident to the police, he decided to settle it amicably and did not pursue the matter further. As for the supposed further conflict at 8:00 PM, this is entirely fabricated by Shao Yizhou as a false accusation. My client has already filed a countersuit against Shao Yizhou, accusing him of false accusations. Fearing that the public might be misled, I have been instructed to request a correction. Therefore, I am writing this letter to request that the original letter be published in your "Letter to the Editor" column.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted,</p>

<h3>Strange is the so-called "Theory of Chinese Medical Art" (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Song Daren</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang himself admits that he is "an amateur." Naturally, he lacks a deep understanding of the structure of Chinese and Western medicine. Yet, he insists on participating in this specialized academic discussion. Even if scientific medicine has its imperfections, he cannot grasp the crux of the matter. He spouts off a lengthy and irrelevant discourse that leaves the reader utterly confused. Using such an article to cast doubt on science and promote a new theory is simply overestimating oneself!</p>
<p>Did Mr. Zhang not say that the few words in Mr. Ding's speech, "If teachers cannot fully teach, students must use their superior talents and abilities to comprehend on their own," are insufficient to form the basis for the argument that Chinese medicine is an art? Indeed, quite right! He also said that Mr. Ding's speech only cited many mystical and superstitious clichés found in ancient medical books, such as yin-yang, the five elements, the five directions, the five colors, the five flavors, and the six energies, etc. But what about his own arguments? Haha; he has fallen into the trap of metaphysics! Mr. Zhang knows that yin-yang and the five elements are unreliable, yet the texts he quotes all originate from yin-yang and the five elements. He even claims that his arguments are ten thousand times more profound than the magic of yin-yang and the five elements. He then goes on to talk nonsense about the six fu organs, the six officials, the six energies, the six excesses, the six meridians, and the six methods. I do not know how this differs from what Mr. Ding cited in his speech? In my opinion, Mr. Zhang cites even more of these clichés than Mr. Ding. Mr. Ding emphasizes talent and experience, which indeed demonstrates a lack of understanding. However, Mr. Zhang goes even further, recklessly discussing philosophy! Isn't this a joke? Moreover, the final section of Mr. Ding's original article still advocates for the scientific reorganization of Chinese medicine's experience. Mr. Zhang, however, is different. Although he also mentions "reorganization is essential," he does not mention the word "science" at all. It seems that Mr. Zhang is somewhat unwilling to approach the "theory of science"—one might even say he detests it. He only finds it interesting to see "absolute scientists" hesitating and faltering!</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, the theory of Chinese medical art is fundamentally untenable. The content of so-called "Chinese medicine" is extremely chaotic, containing elements that coincide with science, as well as elements that are extremely mystical, illusory, absurd, and inconsistent with facts. It is simply a monstrosity. If you wish to create a new theory, you must at least be able to represent the entire academic theory of Chinese medicine, include everything without omission, and be able to reconcile the thoughts and techniques of various doctors throughout each era without forced interpretations. Only then can it be established. This may leave a little wonder in medical history—but only in history, with no benefit to the future of Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>Medicine is absolutely an experimental science and cannot be compared to music, dance, calligraphy, and painting, which are arts. The object of medicine is "people," while art has "objects" as its focus. People are organic and living, while objects are inorganic and lifeless, thus they are different. We see that the application of art can sometimes be increased or decreased at will. A little more can be added here, and a little less can be subtracted there; it is not fixed. If the creation is good, it is said that he has talent; if the creation is not good, it is said that he has no talent. Medicine is not like that. It requires science for diagnosis and science for treatment. Everything must be based on scientific principles. If one relies on personal artistic methods to determine the treatment plan, then it is like what Ban Gu said: "Turning cure into aggravation, turning life into death!" Let me give an example to prove the difference between medicine and art: In the Qing dynasty, there was a famous painter named Luo Liangfeng. He had great talent for painting. Once, he gave Yuan Zicai—a great poet of the Qing dynasty who lived at the same time as Luo—a portrait. Yuan Zicai wrote a letter to him saying, "I don't know whether it's the old man who handles the cooking in the kitchen or the old man who sells porridge in front of the door." He disliked that he was not drawn like himself and returned it to him. However, Luo Yu Feng's artistic talent and value were not cancelled because of this, and no one would recognize the real Yuan Zicai as not Yuan Zicai based on this portrait, but as another villager or old man—it still had no impact on Yuan Zicai and would not cause him to lose his true face. Medicine is related to human life. If it is the same patient, you diagnose that he is talking about phlegm, and another Chinese medicine practitioner says that he has wind. If the pathologies are different, people will feel strange and doubt your great art. If the medicine is used improperly, the treatment is wrong, and the patient is harmed, then the doctor's reputation will be ruined? The so-called artistic application of Chinese medicine, even if it is really under the fingers of contemporary medical practitioners as Mr. Zhang says—but it may not be the case—at most it is just the skill of "people," not the value of "learning." It is clearly about Chinese medicine, but what is being said is about people. (Chinese medicine) "divine skill lies in the person," "whatever to do, one can be handy". Then we see Hua Tuo, Bian Que, in the ancient books - regardless of whether they actually existed, their skills were so magical, but after they died, they became a swan song, and no successors can inherit their unique knowledge. Is this the so-called value of art? What does it have to do with Chinese medicine? Moreover, the application of art is precisely about "cutting, patching, and supplementing." Whether it is broad technology or narrow art, there is this tendency. However, art also has its actual things as its objects, but due to the different talents of each individual, there are differences in height and inferiority. Therefore, wind, dampness, liver yang, and yin deficiency can vary from person to person and be said randomly, and those who cannot find the real object should not be called art. If you insist on giving it the crown of art, it is nothing more than the "Jianghu art" of Chinese medicine! What is the value?</p>
<p>Common Knowledge of Diseases</p>
<h3>Main Symptoms when Diagnosing Intestinal Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>When there is a disease in the intestine, there are several main symptoms in diagnosis, namely (1) pain, (2) bloating, (3) bowel movement, and (4) tenesmus (urge to defecate, straining, feeling of incomplete evacuation) etc. These will be described separately below:</p>
<p>First, pain: The intestine fills a large part of the abdominal cavity, and there are many organs nearby, so when complaining of abdominal pain, it is first necessary to determine whether it is caused by intestinal disease or originates from other organs. For example, kidney stones, bladder stones, gallstone pain, acute pancreatitis, female ovarian and uterine diseases, etc., all have symptoms of abdominal pain and must be differentiated. If the pain is already known to be caused by other diseases, more attention should be paid to whether it is localized in one part or is widespread. However, when patients experience severe abdominal pain, even if it originates in one part, they often complain of pain throughout the entire abdomen, so this point is very difficult to distinguish. It depends entirely on the doctor's rich experience to make a determination.</p>
<p>In the case of localized pain, it is necessary to pay attention to its anatomical location. For example, pain in a small area around the navel mostly comes from the small intestine. In the case of ileitis, appendicitis, pericecal inflammation, etc., the pain occurs in the right lower abdomen. In the case of duodenal ulcers, the pain is directly below the gallbladder. In the case of acute inflammation of the sigmoid colon, severe pain occurs in the left lower abdomen. However, it must also be noted that the location of abdominal pain sometimes does not coincide with the affected area. For example, in the case of appendicitis, the initial pain is often not in the right lower abdomen but is reported as stomach pain or navel pain, or even left abdominal pain. At this time, if you are not careful to palpate the entire abdomen, it is easy to overlook and make a mistake.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is also necessary to pay attention to whether the abdominal pain is continuous or intermittent. Pain caused by the nature of the organ is continuous. Pain that is nervous or caused by spasms in part of the intestinal tract is temporary and intermittent.</p>
<p>Again, it is important to examine the relationship between eating and bowel movements. In the case of duodenal ulcers, the pain is usually more severe three or four hours after eating, especially when eating solid foods. Pain in the large intestine is often related to bowel movements. Continuous or temporary pain occurs before bowel movements. The pain disappears completely after defecation. In other cases, it is necessary to distinguish whether the nature of the pain is acute or chronic, as well as its relationship to exercise, manual pressure, etc. For example, if the abdominal pain is more severe when releasing pressure than when pressing down, it is probably a sign of peritonitis; if the pain is relieved when pressing down, it is a nervous condition.</p>
<p>Second, bloating: Bloating is a symptom of intestinal disease caused by the accumulation of gas in the intestine. Physiologically, gas is sometimes produced in the intestine due to the type of food, and there may be a lot of it, but mild bloating is caused by weakened ability of the intestinal wall blood vessels to absorb gas due to congestion of the portal vein and circulatory disorders. It is also seen in intestinal serositis or peritoneal tuberculosis or cirrhosis of the liver. High levels of bloating are mostly caused by intestinal obstruction, narrowing, or intestinal paralysis. Acute high bloating is usually caused by constipation or is seen in cases of intestinal intussusception. Chronic high bloating, in addition to the above situation turning into a chronic condition, occurs in cases of chronic enteritis, fermentative intestine, indigestion, intestinal neurosis, cicatricial intestinal stenosis, or intestinal spasms.</p>
<p>Third, bowel movement:</p>
<p>A. Constipation: Can be caused by lifestyle, the type of food, or medications. Acute constipation caused by intestinal disease may indicate intestinal obstruction or narrowing. In addition, acute constipation may occur in the course of chronic gastric catarrh, gastric dilatation, peritonitis, and meningitis. Chronic constipation is seen in chronic organic diseases, such as gastric obstruction, habitual constipation, and chronic compression of the intestine by nearby organs.</p>
<p>B. Diarrhea: First, pay attention to whether it is acute or chronic, the causes, and whether it is accompanied by abdominal pain. Diarrhea is often caused by food or drug poisoning, so it is even more important to investigate the previous lifestyle. When infectious diarrhea is prevalent, pay attention to whether there has been any exposure to infection. In diarrhea caused by stomach disease and indigestion, pay attention to whether there were stomach disorders before the onset of the disease.</p>
<p>Chronic diarrhea includes nervous diarrhea, catarrhal diarrhea, chronic peritonitis, intestinal tuberculosis, liver cirrhosis, and other diarrheas. Therefore, pay attention to the other symptoms of these diseases.</p>
<p>Fourth, tenesmus: Tenesmus is mostly seen in dysentery, proctitis, rectal ulcers, perianal inflammation, prostatitis, or hemorrhoids. In women, it may also come from diseases of the uterus or the area surrounding the uterus. In children, it is also seen in intestinal intussusception. In short, the symptom of tenesmus occurs when there is a disease in the deep part of the large intestine or its vicinity.</p>
<p>Common Knowledge of Treatment</p>
<h3>Observations on the Treatment of Pneumonia (Continued from Issue 23)</h3>
<p>— Gu Buwen</p>
<p>After undergoing serum treatment</p>
<p>Mortality rate reduced by fifty percent</p>
<p>Now, in 1,200 cases of infectious Type 1 pneumonia, the mortality rate in those treated with this serum therapy is 15%, while in those treated with non-serum methods, the mortality rate is 25%. Therefore, the number of deaths can be reduced by 40%. In 700 cases of infectious Type 2 pneumonia, the number of deaths can be reduced to 37% or 30%, which can reduce the mortality rate by 19%. Since the introduction of this serum therapy, the mortality rate in various cases has been reduced by almost 50%.</p>
<p>At the same time, another method of treating pneumonia using comprehensive preparations has also been successfully tested. This is a chemical compound called S.U. 36, which is beneficial for various febrile infectious diseases of the respiratory system. This agent should be administered intramuscularly and has good results for the symptoms of influenza and bronchitis, and is especially effective for bronchopneumonia. In lobar pneumonia, fever can also be relieved and reduced, or often restored naturally. The effect of this agent is to enhance the body's resistance.</p>
<p>There is an even more advanced treatment for pneumonia using chemical therapy. A drug called Sulfanilamide (i.e., Prontosil) has now been discovered, which has an excellent effect on streptococcal infections. Initially, it was not very effective for pneumonia, but after thorough research, it was discovered that it contained a substance called 2-Sulphanily 1-Aminopyridine, also known as Mand B 693 (i.e., Dagenan). It was then discovered that its effect was not only effective against streptococci, but also had the same effect on meningococci and pneumococci. Evans and Gaisford used it to treat pneumonia and achieved fully satisfactory results because their body temperature dropped rapidly and the patient's symptoms also showed significant improvement.</p>
<p>However, the use of this drug should be fully considered with caution, because although it contains fewer toxins than sulfanilamide, it has various special reactions, such as feeling unwell, headache, nausea, anemia, etc. Therefore, the quantitative management of the patient's diet must be strictly controlled. Furthermore, foods or laxatives containing sulfur must be avoided as much as possible. The obvious effect of this agent is to eliminate the capsule of pneumococcus, which is achieved by the smooth flow of white blood cells, and then the task of destroying the capsule can be achieved.</p>
<p>After using Mand B693, there is no need to do the usual chest poultices or take stimulants.</p>
<p>Unless breathing is severely difficult, it is rare to use oxygen. It is only used occasionally to do everything possible until the final breath or when it is recognized that it is impossible to save the patient.</p>
<p>If oxygen is used at the beginning of the disease, it has a definite value because it can relieve heart fatigue and greatly facilitate breathing. Therefore, early use of oxygen can often prevent the aggravation of lung congestion. This symptom of lung congestion often causes complications of lobar pneumonia, which is very dangerous and cannot be denied. Therefore, early use of oxygen in clinical practice can increase the chances of recovery and is not insignificant.</p>

<h3>International Rover Scout Jamboree Opens in England Yesterday, 42 Countries Participate</h3>
<p>(Reuters, London, 16th) The International Rover Scout Jamboree, with the participation of 42 countries, opened today at Monk's Hill near Penhurst. When the Scottish Secretary of State, Colville, gave a welcoming speech, he read a telegram from Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, saying that he could not attend due to official duties, which he regretted very much. However, from his experience in India, he had a slight knowledge of the value of the Rover movement, and he strongly stated that this kind of gathering has a major relationship in enhancing the understanding and friendship of young people from various countries.</p>
<h3>Overview of National University Curriculum (Part 2): Curriculum Ignores Domestic Materials and Actual Life; Natural Sciences and Social Sciences are Not Interconnected</h3>
<p>(2) Inconsistency in required and elective subjects: The same subject is listed as required in some schools and as elective in others. For example, in the Department of Biology of the eighteen universities, thirteen schools list General Botany as required, one school lists it as elective, and four schools do not offer this course. In the Department of Chemistry, Industrial Chemistry is listed as required in eighteen of the twenty-five schools, as elective in three schools, and four schools do not offer this course. In the Department of Physics, eighteen of the twenty universities list College Physics as required, two schools list it as elective. Ordinary Physics is listed as required in eighteen of the twenty universities, and two schools do not offer this course. Equation theory is listed as required by ten schools in the Department of Mathematics, as elective by five schools, and five schools do not offer this course. For all these listed subjects, whether they are important or unimportant in each department, whether they should be taken or not, the schools' evaluations differ so much.</p>
<p>(3) The amount of curriculum varies from school to school: The number of class hours for each subject is also very inconsistent. The Calculus of the Department of Mathematics of each school is a full-year course, but the class time is set at four hours per week, three hours per week, and five hours per week. In the Department of Physics, Modern Physics is set at three hours of lectures and three hours of practice per week to be completed in one year, three hours of lectures per week to be completed in one and a half years, one hour of lectures per week to be completed in two years, and three hours of lectures per week to be completed in half a year. In the Department of Chemistry, Qualitative Analysis has the least amount of class time, with two hours of lectures and nine hours of practice per week, to be completed in half a year, and the most is two hours of lectures and twelve hours of practice per week, to be completed in one year. There is no fixed standard for the amount of teaching for each subject in each school, and the situation is like this.</p>
<p>(4) The grade level at which subjects are set differs:</p>
<p>The year in which the same subject is set in each school is not always the same. Some are set for first-year students, some are set for second-year students, and even in School A it is required for first-year students, while School B lists it as required for third-year or fourth-year students. For example, in the Department of Chinese Literature, Introduction to Literature is listed as required in nine of the twenty schools, five schools arrange it in the first year, three schools arrange it in the second year, and one school arranges it in the fourth year. In the Department of Law, History of Chinese Legal System is listed as required in six of the seventeen schools, one school arranges it in the first year, one school arranges it in the third year, and four schools arrange it in the fourth year. In the Department of Philosophy, Ethics is listed as required in seven schools, two schools arrange it in the first year, one school arranges it in the second year, two schools arrange it in the third year, one school arranges it in the third or fourth year, and one school does not specify the grade level. This is not only the case in the liberal arts departments, but also in the departments of the science faculty. In the Department of Botany, Plant Morphology is required in twelve of the twenty schools, two schools arrange it in the first year, seven schools in the second year, two schools in the third year, and one school in the second or third year. In the Department of Mathematics, Advanced Calculus is required in seventeen of the twenty schools, twelve schools arrange it in the second year, four schools in the third year, and one school in the fourth year. The depth and disorder of the curriculum setting in each school is like this.</p>
<p>(5) The names of the subjects are different:</p>
<p>Between schools, the names of subjects with similar natures are called one name in School A and another name in School B. For example, Equation Theory in the Department of Mathematics is called Elementary Equation, Modern Geometry, or Modern Pure Geometry. Physical Chemistry and Theoretical Chemistry in the Department of Chemistry, Military Chemistry and National Defense Chemistry, Teaching Method and General Teaching Method in the Department of Education, Methodology of History and Historical Research Method in the Department of History, Comparative Government and European Continental Government in the Department of Political Science, etc.</p>
<p>(6) Repetition of subjects in the same school</p>
<p>In the same department of a school, there are subjects that are repeated, only the names are slightly different. For example, in the Department of Chemistry, Organic Chemistry has already been set up, and at the same time, Introduction to Organic Chemistry and Organic Chemistry Theory are set up. In the Department of Physics, Ordinary Physics has already been set up, and the Outline of Physics and the Overview of Physics are set up again. In the Department of Mathematics, Modern Algebra has already been set up, and the General Theory of Modern Algebra is set up again. There are also repeated subjects in the same school due to different departments. The Department of Law sets up Administrative Law, which is taught by one professor, while the Department of Political Science sets up General Theory of Administration, which is taught by another professor. The Department of Chinese Literature sets up Laozi and Zhuangzi, which is taught by one professor, while the Department of Philosophy sets up Laozi and Zhuangzi Philosophy, which is taught by another professor. Repetition and complexity are inevitable in most schools.</p>
<p>(7) Emphasis on specialized subjects while neglecting basic courses</p>
<p>The general phenomenon is that they all like to set up courses that are quite specialized. The Department of Political Science simultaneously requires Comparative Civil Service System and Anglo-American Administrative System. The Department of Sociology simultaneously requires Chinese Social Organization and Chinese Social Problems. The Department of Economics requires the theory of the business cycle and Marxist economic theory. The Department of Chinese Literature sets up Western Sinology Phonology and Research on Oracle Bone Inscriptions and Bronze Inscriptions. The courses of the University Graduate School are often set within the four-year curriculum of the University.</p>
<p>The above seven points are the phenomena obtained by comparing the curriculum settings of various universities and departments. If we further discuss the content of the curriculum, the neglect of domestic materials, the isolation from actual life, and the lack of connection between natural sciences and social sciences, and the lack of a consistent trend in the opening of courses in various schools, are also general phenomena of the university curriculum.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Yangzhou High School to Move to Shanghai, Students Form School Protection Association, Requesting the Department of Education to Prevent the Move</h3>
<p>(Taixian Correspondence) The Jiangsu Provincial Yangzhou High School in Taixian County has been very successful since its establishment because it meets the needs of out-of-school youth in northern Jiangsu. The Jiangsu Department of Education recently ordered the school to move to Shanghai for the next semester. Most of the students at the school have a deep belief in the school and are unwilling to transfer to other schools, and they face many difficulties in continuing their studies. Yesterday, more than 300 students in the school gathered to discuss the matter. As a result, they formed a school protection association and requested the department to prevent the move. They have now sent telegrams to the Jiangsu Department of Education and various parties to appeal.</p>
<h3>Three Middle Schools Approved by the Ministry of Education to Enroll Impoverished Students</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of Xiaoguang, Zhaoguang, and Yude Middle Schools in this city, which are specially approved by the Ministry of Education, they have attracted the attention of people from all walks of life. Moreover, due to their low tuition fees, young students are flocking to them. It is said that the nature of these schools and their purpose of running schools is to help out-of-school students and impoverished children. Therefore, tuition fees must be reduced as much as possible. The students they enroll are limited to out-of-school and impoverished children. Therefore, it is earnestly hoped that students who are already studying at other schools will not apply for the entrance exams. If students are found to be not impoverished among those admitted in the future, they may be advised to transfer to other schools.</p>

<h3>A Brief Discussion on Old Celebrities</h3>
<p>— Shangqing</p>
<p>I don't believe the ancient saying that "drinking heavily and reading *Li Sao* is enough to be called a celebrity." Because that's too simple. There are of course various reasons why a celebrity is a celebrity.</p>
<p>Celebrities accumulate virtue, are capable in writing, and value integrity. Naturally, they have many things that make people admire them. However, the habits of celebrities, such as getting drunk and acting impulsively, being unkempt, and neglecting their families' livelihoods, do indeed make people frown and dare not approach them.</p>
<p>By "old celebrities," I mean those who are old and purely old-fashioned. However, I don't want to evaluate the value of old celebrities or whether they are needed today. I just want to say a few words about the old celebrities I have heard about and seen, hoping that in this rapidly progressing modern era, especially in the process of the whole country resisting the war, they will not fall too far behind and be unable to contribute.</p>
<p>I believe that what makes old celebrities fall too far behind the times is their superstition. Praying for dreams, consulting mediums, and fortune-telling are their superstitious behaviors, and immortals, Buddhas, ghosts, and gods are the objects of their superstition. They have forgotten Confucius's words, "Not yet understanding life, how can you understand death?" "Not yet able to serve people, how can you serve ghosts?" "Respect ghosts and gods, but keep them at a distance." and "Worship the gods as if they were present." According to modern scientific explanations, dreams and consulting mediums are all self-deceptive subconscious actions, and immortals, Buddhas, ghosts, and gods are at most fabrications created by religious figures to save the world and people's hearts, tools to scare women, children, and ignorant people. They are unwilling to explore science even slightly, but instead blindly deceive themselves, believing that dreams have evidence, mediums are accurate, and ghosts and gods are spiritual. They not only deceive themselves but also talk about it with relish, proclaiming it verbally and writing it down, boasting of unexpected encounters and unique secrets. They don't think about how much they themselves are harmed, let alone how much harm they cause to others. Can the handling of world affairs and the progress of world civilization be entrusted to dreams, consulting mediums, and seeking help from ghosts and gods?</p>
<p>They have missed the opportunity for self-development and hindered the progress of the world. They should not do this.</p>
<p>What makes them backward, just like superstition, is their feudal thinking. They only believe in the ways of the ancient kings and do not understand that Confucius was a reformer who used the past to change the present. They do not approve of new political systems, let alone think about modern political trends and social ideals. They try their best to preserve patriarchal society and maintain outdated morals such as women must remain chaste while men can take concubines and visit prostitutes. In other words, they want to restore everything, especially in literature. They only think that classical Chinese is good, especially ancient-style poetry and prose in classical Chinese. Therefore, they try their best to imitate it and urge others to imitate it as well, not knowing that imitation will never succeed and that there is absolutely no need for this imitation in the current era. I say this not like them, who know nothing about new literature and dismiss it as boring, or who know nothing about old literature and dismiss it as useless. Although I am not a top scholar, I have also been involved in this area and know a thing or two. I believe that restoration is undesirable, and promoting ancient-style poetry and prose is especially undesirable. There are many reasons, but in a nutshell, they have missed the opportunity for self-development and hindered the progress of the world.</p>
<p>They may boast of knowing astronomy above—perhaps the astronomy of astrology—and of knowing geography below—perhaps the geography of feng shui—but as the ancients criticized certain celebrities, they absolutely know nothing about human affairs! Their superstition and restoration are a result of not knowing human affairs, in other words, not knowing the affairs of the world! How can one not know human affairs for the sake of people! How can one not know the affairs of the present world when living in the present world! They should not fall too far behind!</p>
<p>Because they have fallen so far behind, they have nothing to contribute to the current war of resistance. Of course, their integrity can be used at this moment. Their unwavering integrity in the face of great adversity, never shamelessly serving the enemy, is enough to inspire the weak and corrupt. However, this is passive and lacks active action, which is still of no help. Moreover, people like Huang Qiuyue were also celebrities of their time. Therefore, passive integrity without active action inevitably has many crises surrounding it.</p>
<p>At this critical juncture of life and death, if they want to preserve the value of their true celebrity status, they should break their superstition, abandon their restorationist thinking, and contribute to this great era in their own positions! As for how to contribute, I think they will have a way as long as they are determined, and there is no need for me to say anything more.</p>
<h3>Running</h3>
<p>— Chen Yongcai</p>
<p>A stuffy day: no sun, no wind, no rain.</p>
<p>Lao Yan sighed.</p>
<p>"Lao Xin! Where shall we eat lunch?"</p>
<p>"Damn it, if I have money, I'll eat wherever I want. If I don't have money, what's there to talk about!"</p>
<p>"How about eating at my house?"</p>
<p>"Only a bastard would go to your house! Your mother's face..."</p>
<p>Lao Xin was just such a straightforward fellow. I said:</p>
<p>"Hey, you're my friend. Just let my mother be! If she's got a long face, just pretend you don't see it." I looked at him. "We have to eat, after all!...Come on, let's go together."</p>
<p>I went to pull him, but he suddenly broke free and ran to the other side of the road.</p>
<p>In the evening, it cooled down, and there was a bit of wind.</p>
<p>Lao Xin was whistling at the back door. My mother said:</p>
<p>"Your beggar friend is calling you to go beg for food together!"</p>
<p>I muttered, "What's wrong with having a beggar friend?" and glared at her.</p>
<p>Pale yellow lamplight spilled on his face: Lao Xin looked even thinner.</p>
<p>We walked out of the alleyway.</p>
<p>"Lao Xin! What did you eat at noon?"</p>
<p>"Two sesame cakes, totaling two cents."</p>
<p>There was a black thing stuck to his collar. I thought it was a bedbug.</p>
<p>"Where did that bedbug on your collar come from? Are there a lot of bedbugs in the hostel?"</p>
<p>He put the black thing in his mouth, smiled a little, ha, it turned out to be a sesame seed.</p>
<p>The street was still quiet. The trees swayed, their leaves rustling. Shadows flickered. What was most annoying was the grit, which flew into my face and made it itch uncomfortably.</p>
<p>The distant streetlights looked like stars in the sky.</p>
<p>"Where are we going?"</p>
<p>Lao Xin didn't answer, his eyes fixed on the ground. He started singing softly:</p>
<p>Wandering, escaping;</p>
<p>Escaping, wandering!</p>
<p>When will the wandering end?</p>
<p>Where will the escape lead?</p>
<p>A car sped past, the fumes and dust suffocating me.</p>
<p>Lao Xin suddenly leaned against the wall and stopped walking. He was panting.</p>
<p>"Damn it, I can't walk anymore!...My eyes are blurry..."</p>
<p>I helped him up, and he glanced at me.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Lao Xin! Didn't you eat enough at noon?"</p>
<p>He bit his lip and started walking again.</p>
<p>"I don't have any money, of course I didn't eat enough! Can you lend me five cents tonight? Five cents will pay for tonight's hostel, and tomorrow I'll have to eat something. I'm leaving tomorrow afternoon! Just think:</p>
<p>Our country is in turmoil!</p>
<p>We have nowhere to wander,</p>
<p>Nowhere to escape!</p>
<p>How about it? Can you lend me five cents?"</p>
<p>I fished a few small bills out of my pocket and gave them to him. He put them in his pocket:</p>
<p>"Is that five cents?"</p>
<p>"I don't know!"</p>
<p>Lao Xin muttered.</p>
<p>"Where are you going tomorrow?" I suddenly remembered to ask him. "Where's the travel money coming from?"</p>
<p>"I'll figure it out tomorrow. If I don't have any money, I'll sell something and borrow a little more."</p>
<p>After a while:</p>
<p>"Can you lend me some more? I'm really sorry..."</p>
<p>"Sure! Come tomorrow! But... at most, I can find a way to get five yuan." "I'll be able to figure something out when I get to Wenzhou!..."</p>
<p>The next day, he didn't come in the morning, and I didn't see him in the afternoon either. I thought he wouldn't come.</p>
<p>It was getting dark. It started to rain intermittently, the wind gusting stronger and stronger, the lamplight shrinking blurrily into a ball.</p>
<p>...Mumbling... *Woosh—woosh!*</p>
<p>My mother wasn't home. I stuck my head out the window and, sure enough, it was Lao Xin.</p>
<p>I handed Lao Xin the five-yuan bill, and he suddenly became embarrassed.</p>
<p>"I always feel really bad..."</p>
<p>"Don't say too much. Why didn't you come during the day? I waited for you all day."</p>
<p>"Damn it, it took me all day to sell my stuff. Luckily, the ship doesn't leave until tonight!"</p>
<p>The raindrops were getting bigger. Lao Xin's hair was wet and stuck together. He squeezed some water out of it with his fingers and flicked it away casually.</p>
<p>"Write when you get there!" I couldn't think of anything to say. "Hey, is that enough money?"</p>
<p>"Maybe I'll write! I have enough money!"</p>
<p>He was about to leave. I grabbed an umbrella for him because it was raining harder.</p>
<p>He nodded, opened the umbrella, and walked toward the alleyway.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he turned back, the rain pattering on the umbrella. He lowered the umbrella:</p>
<p>"Here, take it back!"</p>
<p>"What? It's raining so hard, and you're still..."</p>
<p>He put the umbrella down.</p>
<p>"Damn it, that thing's annoying to carry. I'm not afraid of the rain! I'm off!"</p>
<p>Lao Xin limped and staggered away.</p>
<p>Lao Xin's figure disappeared into the rain.</p>
<h3>On the Road to Danyang (Part 2)</h3>

<p>——A Wartime Journal from the Shanghai-Nanjing Line</p>
<p>We each arranged our bowls and chopsticks and scooped food from the pot. The old woman stood to the side, looking at us with pity, as if we were desperately hungry.</p>
<p>Whoever talks the most while eating loses out. Everyone was silent, staring blankly at the old woman.</p>
<p>After helping the old woman with her chores, it was already around three o'clock. We quickly bid farewell to the old woman. In the end, I told her an extraordinary piece of news. The secretary secretly gave a child a dollar, and we hurriedly left the small village.</p>
<p>Bending over, hunching our heads, like boatmen pulling a rope on the riverbank. Thinking of the taste of sweet potatoes, I wonder when we will be able to taste them again? (Donating proceeds from a charity sale)</p>

<h3>Red Devil Vasika</h3>
<p>— By Gorky, Translated by Di Zhou</p>
<p>The girls crowded at the door as if glued together. Silently listening to Asnia's murmurs and Vasika's moans.</p>
<p>Lida stood in front of the crowd, quickly flicking the red hair stuck to her fingers.</p>
<p>"What if he dies?" someone said softly, and then immediately fell silent...</p>
<p>The girls tried their best not to make any noise and carefully left Vasika's room. After they left, various broken things and tattered pieces of cloth were scattered on the floor.</p>
<p>Asnia was left alone in the house.</p>
<p>She sighed deeply, walked to Vasika's side, and asked softly;</p>
<p>"Hey, do you need anything?"</p>
<p>He opened his swollen eyes and stared at her, not answering anything.</p>
<p>"Hey, say something... Do you want water?... Yes, I can get you anything... Ah... You must want some water? Then I'll go get it..."</p>
<p>Vasika only shook his head silently, moved his lips, but still didn't say a word.</p>
<p>"Oh dear, why—won't you say anything!" Asnia smoothed the curls on her neck and said, "Are we making you suffer?... Does it hurt, Vasika? Huh? Endure it, endure it, it will be healed soon, it's just a little painful at first,... I know that!"</p>
<p>Vasika's head moved, and he said in a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"Please... give me some water..."</p>
<p>The insatiable greed in his eyes was gone.</p>
<p>Except for eating, drinking tea, and bringing things to the patient downstairs, Asnia stayed in Vasika's room upstairs. The sisters didn't talk to her or ask her anything. The madam didn't interfere with her taking care of the patient, nor did she call her to receive guests. Asnia often sat by the window in Vasika's room, watching the snow-covered roofs, the frost-whitened branches, and the plumes of smoke rising like white clouds. When she was tired of watching, she leaned on the table there and dozed off. At night, she lay down on the floor near Vasika's bed and spent the night. (10)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Establishes Temperance Society</h3>
<p>A temperance society has been established in Shanghai, opposite the chapel behind the Shanghai Municipal Council in the British Concession. The original intention of its establishment was for the sake of sailors on steamships. Because after they come ashore, many go to bars to drink heavily, and when drunk, they often cause trouble. With the establishment of the society, this problem can be avoided. The rooms inside the society are clean, the equipment is beautiful, and there are books and new newspapers for entertainment. There is either one meeting per week, or two meetings per week. On meeting days, exquisite dishes and delicacies, exotic fruits, and famous cakes are prepared for a small banquet, for conversation, but without alcohol. The hall has already been opened last Saturday, with more than two hundred sailors and Western gentlemen from Shanghai gathering. Admiral Tie of the navy also came to inspect after the meal, showing a strong sense of Yu Liang in the Southern Pavilion, with no small amount of excitement. He is an upright and forthright man, and the sailors show him great respect and love. The admiral also praised the society greatly for its good system.</p>
<h3>Westerners Race Sampans in Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>This afternoon, Westerners raced small boats in Suzhou Creek at the New Bund Bridge. For a time, Chinese and Western gentlemen and ladies lined the riverbank to enjoy the view, their heels touching each other, leaving almost no space. Before the race, a flag was erected on an earthen mound three or four miles away from the mooring place. A Westerner on it was using a telescope to look from a high place. From there, the sampans all untied their ropes and moved forward, each boat carrying a small flag, turquoise, green, and red as markers. The first race consisted of two boats, each driven by six people. The boatmen on the boats were all wearing narrow-sleeved short shirts, and as soon as they left the shore, they quickly rowed with double oars, as fast as arrows. In no time, they had reached the bottom of the earthen mound. The Westerners on the mound, seeing that the boat with the green flag had arrived first, fired a foreign gun to show their praise. The boat was two or three zhang long, narrow at the front and back but wider in the middle. Afterwards, several more races were held, and it was not until about five o'clock that the performances ended.</p>

<h3>Shanghai War Zone Infant Asylum</h3>
<p>— (Xishan)</p>
<p>Before the war, Shanghai had several infant asylums, taking in those abandoned infants. However, with the outbreak of the Shanghai war, these infant asylums, either due to financial reasons or because they were located in the war zone, closed down one after another. However, the abandonment of newborn infants has increased, and most of them come from the war zone. In this situation, the Chinese Children's Welfare Association established a Shanghai War Zone Infant Asylum to rescue helpless infants born in the war zone. The asylum has been established for two years now and was originally located in a church on Beichang Road. It has now been moved to 116 Dunxin Road on the Great Western Road. Yesterday, the reporter accompanied Mr. Chen Zhengfan of the Chinese Children's Welfare Association to visit. Now, I will give a brief introduction to the work and implementation of the asylum:</p>
<p>The asylum is located on the Great Western Road, so the surrounding environment is quite quiet. Entering the gate, there is a Western-style large residence with a garden in front of the house. The air is very good, and this environment is indeed very suitable for children. The current person in charge of the asylum is Mrs. M.J. Helmick. The Children's Welfare Association provides the asylum with a monthly funding of one thousand yuan. The insufficient portion is donated by Mrs. Helmick to her friends. The method is that the donor designates to adopt an infant, taking on the adoption fee of fourteen yuan per month. Therefore, on the cribs of the children, there is often a sign hanging, with the name of the adopter written on it. This indicates that the infant has been adopted by someone. Dr. Cheng Kangyou is in charge of the health work of the infants in the asylum. Daily life is managed by nurses and assistants. The head nurse is Ms. He Xiulian, and there are several teachers to teach the older children.</p>
<p>In the 27th year, the asylum admitted a total of 225 infants. After placing 60 and 79 deaths, there are currently 86 remaining. These 86 infants are divided into five groups according to their age: newborn to five months; five months to ten months; ten months to one year; one year to two years; and two years and older. Each group is managed by different nurses. The asylum has three floors. The downstairs, except for a part used as a laundry room, is all used for recreation. The second floor is the infants' bedroom. The bedding is all small white-painted iron beds and rattan cradles. The layout of each room is extremely clean, and the spacing between each bed is quite wide. There is sufficient light and air. The third floor is the bedroom for older infants. At the same time, a classroom is opened outside the bedroom, with desks, blackboards, and toys, which are used to enlighten children's knowledge. Ms. Bao Shufang and Chen Sufang are responsible for this part of the work.</p>
<p>The daily life routine of the infants in the asylum is that they get up at 6:00 AM. After getting up, they conduct a cleaning inspection and test their body temperature. Breakfast is at 7:30 AM. Bathing at 8:00 AM. Another feeding at 10:00 AM. Naps from 11:30 AM to 2:00 PM. Feeding at 3:00 PM. Feeding at 6:00 PM. Going to sleep at 7:00 PM. Among them, older children have separate scheduled literacy time and recreation time. In terms of food, each infant is also different according to their age. Infants from newborn to five months are completely fed with milk powder; those from five months to ten months are fed with milk powder and wheat paste; those from ten months to one year eat wheat paste and bean cakes; those from one year to two years and two years and older are given rice and bean cakes. In terms of clothing, most of it is made by themselves, and some is donated by other places.</p>
<p>This is a very peculiar phenomenon. The number of girls in the asylum is more than twice that of boys. There are only twenty or so male infants at present, and the remaining sixty or so are all girls. From this point, it can be clearly shown that the social atmosphere of valuing men and devaluing women is still very strong. At present, the asylum not only takes in helpless infants from the war zone, but also takes in other abandoned infants at its discretion. At the same time, if someone wants to adopt an infant from the asylum, they are also very welcome. Anyone who wants to adopt can first contact the asylum and select an infant. After the selection, the asylum will issue a request form and fill out a statement form from the adopter, which will be directly sent to the Chinese Children's Welfare Association. After the association investigates and qualifies, they can adopt. However, after adoption, the association may investigate the living conditions of the infant after being adopted at any time. If an unsuitable living environment is found, the association has the right to take the adopted infant back. At the same time, the asylum also has several regulations for adopters: The adopter must have a proper occupation, with a monthly income of more than fifty yuan, and have the ability to adopt. The adopter must have a reliable guarantor, and it should be stated at the time of adoption that the adopter will teach the adopted child and give them inheritance rights. But in fact, although there are a number of requests for adoption at the asylum every day, very few are able to qualify.</p>
<p>Since its establishment after the war, the asylum has been managed by the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, Mrs. Helmick, and various staff members. Most of the planned work has been implemented, and active improvements have been made in the health, care, and intellectual development of infants, so the achievements are very satisfactory. However, it is still hoped that people from all walks of life can provide sympathetic cooperation.</p>

<h3>Unemployed Attention! Another Scam to Collect Application Fees</h3>
<p>— Fuyun</p>
<p>Why is a 50 yuan deposit required for a tea server? How can an indefinite number of trainees be accommodated?</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>The trick of recruiting employees to defraud money has long been exposed, but unexpectedly there are still people performing it there, and some people are still being fooled. Although a half-dollar application fee is not a large amount, it is limited to one person, but hundreds of people can make it considerable! This cunning trick of deceiving the unemployed out of their money is like sucking the blood from the unemployed, it's really hateful! I am sharing the facts in this publication to prevent the unemployed from being fooled. The facts are as follows:</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, in the recruitment column of the ×× newspaper, there was an advertisement for recruiting trainees and tea servers, stating that the trainees' monthly salary was six yuan, and the tea servers' monthly salary was eight yuan, without specifying age or qualifications. Generally, the unemployed who are wandering around all day, seeing that there are no qualifications or age limits, and no harsh conditions, think that it is a good opportunity not to be missed, so they bring the newspaper to ××× Fuzhou Road to try their luck. Just after ten o'clock, a hundred people were already squeezed into this room. Inside, on the wall, there was a temporary sign written on a piece of paper: "×× Enterprise Society." There was a large desk, three people in suits and leather shoes, two around thirty years old, and one just over twenty, who were the temporary examiners; two sitting at the two ends of the desk, and one standing in front of the desk. One by one, the unemployed went to them for individual interviews. The general idea was that now the company's business is developed, and after posting the advertisement in the newspaper, many people have come to apply and been accepted. There are only two vacancies for tea servers, and a deposit of 50 yuan must be paid first. The trainees are hired and sent to work elsewhere (not in other places, but because the company's business is developing, and the room where the interview is being held is no longer sufficient, elsewhere refers to the location to be expanded). There is no fixed number of trainees, and an application fee of 50 cents must be paid first. After review, a letter will be sent to reply whether or not they are accepted, and the application fee will not be refunded. Most of the unemployed cannot afford the tea server's deposit, but quite a few people pay the 50-cent application fee for trainees, leaving their addresses and waiting for good news at home.——This 50-cent application fee, whether or not they are accepted, will not be refunded, and there are no age or qualification limits, so many people fall for it. It is said that the business is developed, but there is not even an enamel sign, isn't it the same old trick?</p>
<h3>Biographies of Female Ballad Singers</h3>
<p>— Shen You</p>
<p>If "Ai Qing" is "　Qing", then it can be verified that she was a native of Wu, and was sisters with Huang Xiuqing and Huang Yunqing. She was skilled in ballad singing and had a reputation for beauty. As for Wu Suqing, Wang Tao's "Ying 　Magazine" has already mentioned her, and "Hai Zou Ye You Supplement" has also touched on her. The "Supplement" says:</p>
<p>A man washing his ears by the Wusong River collected twenty-eight ballad-singing women in Shanghai and commented on them. For a time, it spread throughout the brothels, and those who copied the words of Yang Bote were almost as expensive as paper. It was unexpected that the world has changed, and small changes have occurred, and the romantic events have been scattered, and personnel have changed. People like Yuan Yunxian, Wu Suqing, Jiang Yueqing, Zhu Youxiang, and Xu Yayan are married. Chen Aiqing has gone elsewhere. Qian Yaqing has passed away. Qian Liqing, Tang Yunqing, Yu Cuie, and Wu Liqin are nowhere to be found. It is truly sad to feel the passage of time and the differences between the past and the present. Those who have succeeded them include Zhu Liqing, whose beauty and talent are unparalleled, like a crown in Changtai. Others such as Wang Qinxian, Jin Yuzhen, Chen Zhaoyun, and Zhang Cuixia are all charming and pitiful, enough to rival their predecessors, and are indeed outstanding among the later generations. Shanghai has many talented people, which is enough to add color to this profession.</p>
<p>I don't know if the "appraisal" of the ear-washing man mentioned in the article is the "Book Immortal Flower List". At the same time, the Foolish Taoist also has "Twenty-Four Women's Flower Appreciation Pictures with Titles from Red Snow Lyrics", which compares Suqing to a "narcissus", calling her a "talented woman", and commenting: "The bright moon in Xiangjiang has given up her jade pendant, and the clear breeze in Luoshui has come to play with pearls." Her personality can be seen, but unfortunately, her skills are not mentioned. Chiping Sou's "Brief History of Welcoming Female Ballad Singers" has mentioned her book-singing life, but it does not belong to the area of excellence. Chiping Sou said:</p>
<p>In Shanghai customs, female ballad singers are called "teachers", the singing place is called "book field", and the performance of each skill is called "meeting book". All members are not allowed to sit in the field until they are old. However, there are four people who do not attend the meeting book: Wu Suqing, Chen Daixiang, Wang Lijuan, and Chen Zhixiang. These four people are indeed outside the dust.</p>
<p>It can be seen that she is not an ordinary ballad-singing woman. In addition to the above-mentioned female ballad singers, Chiping Sou also mentioned Wang Xiuqing and Hu Guifang, calling them "Yuan Yunxian's disciples". He also made comments on the following people:</p>
<p>Tang Yunqing, with a true and straightforward personality, was originally named Xue Baoqin, and was in the same profession as Xue Baochan. A secretary of Hangzhou redeemed her, and later a magistrate from Anhui changed her current name. Baochan is quite sincere. Zhu Jingxiang has not been seen, but it is said that she can have a clear conversation. Youxiang is her disciple. Zhu Pinlan and Zhu Sulan are two sisters. Pinlan is slightly naive, and Sulan is more articulate. Pinlan fell in love with someone and wanted to marry him, but her parents locked her in a room and sold her shortly afterwards. When Sulan performed her skills, her appearance was too solemn, and some said that this was a chastity arch on her forehead. Zhu Suqing is her sister. Hu Liqing is good at flattering people and is jokingly called a vixen, because these three characters are similar to her name. She has recently redeemed herself and belongs to the Qian family. Yaqing is her sister. Chen Aiqing is inferior to Liqing, Zhang Fengjuan has been married for a long time, her appearance is average, but she is very deep in love. Yu Cuie is quite quiet. Others such as Shi Yuelan, who is Yuan Yunxian's sister. Chen Yuezhen, who is Chen Yuee's sister. Jiang Yuejuan, Jiang Yueqing, who are Jiang Yuee's sisters. Zhang Xiujuan, who is Zhang Fengjuan's sister. Hu Lanfang, who is Hu Lanfang's sister. As well as Wang Yueqin, Wu Liqin, Zhang Yunqing and other ladies, are all outstanding in later generations, and I have not seen most of the rest. (9)</p>
<h3>Cameraman's Good Fortune</h3>
<p>— Qihua</p>
<p>“Anything For A Thrill”</p>
<p>Hollywood film companies do not perfunctorily produce newsreels because they are appendages of feature films; in order to quickly convey situations from all over the world, from politics to folk customs, as well as many accidental events, to the audience, they are not only carefully designed, but also highly competitive. For example, recently, the beauty of the British Emperor and Empress, Shanghai's cinemas (first-run) are all showing newsreels from various companies; not long after the American submarine accident, we also saw the rescue newsreels on the screen.</p>
<p>Since the production of newsreels is valued by the authorities of various companies, the staff responsible for the production naturally have to go through strict screening. They must at least have a healthy physique, be agile in their movements, and also have the most important condition: alertness. When the "August 13th" war broke out, many people thought of going to the front to shoot war films, but the result was that there were no achievements. Naturally, the lack of material conditions was one reason, and the lack of such talents was also an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Because I watched "Cameraman's Good Fortune," I said a lot of nonsense.</p>
<p>The story of "Cameraman's Good Fortune" is very poor, but it writes about Tang McLore's (Flan Ruda) alertness and bravery, which is what every news photographer should learn.</p>
<p>The handling of the whole film is not too dull. The few scenes of Tang McLore secretly filming Betty and stealing the newsreel, and the villains robbing the film during the screening, are quite tense and cater to the tastes of the petty bourgeoisie.</p>

<h3>Opera School and Cheng Melody (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Leng Fang</p>
<p>… … Spoken by Ms. Hou Yulan, “Female Yanqiu” … …</p>
<p>Introduction by Jiping: Hou Yulan, nicknamed "Female Yanqiu," is both skilled in singing and acting, and is excellent in both appearance and talent. She is an outstanding talent among the rising female Dan actors in the capital. She is here to perform with the famous bearded actor Yan Jupeng, and her new voice is being tried for the first time. As soon as she sings, she becomes popular; her reputation is well-deserved and not accidental. She specializes in Qingyi, Hua Shan plays, and newly arranged plays, with more than a hundred plays in total; she is dignified and solemn, simple and unadorned, like a maiden from an old family, and has absolutely no air of an actress; this year she is only nineteen years old, and her future achievements are unlimited, she is a very commendable excellent female artist.</p>
<p>This is my first time coming to the South, and I am still young and have too little experience. I don't know much about drama, so I only know to perform seriously on stage and practice seriously off stage. I can say that I have no opinions on drama.</p>
<p>I am a student of the "Chinese Opera School" in Peiping. I entered the school at the age of fourteen and graduated last December at the age of eighteen. The term of study at the opera school is usually seven years, but because I had some foundation before entering the school, I was considered a transfer student, and I graduated after only five years.</p>
<p>Since coming to Shanghai a few days ago, many gentlemen who care about the drama business have asked me about the internal situation of the opera school. I am very happy, and I am very willing to talk about learning opera in our opera school in detail.</p>
<p>Our opera school is located in Muchang Hutong outside Chongmen; it is a very large hall with a total of more than one hundred rooms. The current principal, Mr. Jin Huilu, is a scholar. There are nearly thirty teachers who teach opera singing and acting for each level of Sheng, Dan, Jing, and Chou, most of them are famous old actors in their fifties and sixties; there are also six or seven teachers who teach Chinese, English, math, and other general courses. The rules for learning opera are roughly the same as in the opera troupe; however, the opera school organization is purely school-based and regulated, such as training, management, accommodation, and other aspects, everything is orderly and very serious. It allows students to focus on training in basic knowledge outside of learning opera, so that everyone has a sound personality.</p>
<p>The scheduled class time every day is from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM to teach opera; from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM to practice martial arts, waist and legs, somersaults, and weapon techniques.——Those who study literary plays only need to learn weapon techniques and leg kicks. From 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM in the evening, Chinese, English, math, and other general courses are taught. There are more than one hundred male and female students in the whole school; the teaching method is to divide Qingyi, Hua Dan, Sheng, Wu Sheng... etc. into separate classes, set up separate classrooms, and teach at the same time; singing and dialogue focus on oral teaching, and opera books are only for reference; when students violate regulations, the teachers only limit them to facing the wall as a punishment, and do not often punish them severely like in the opera troupe.</p>
<p>The rules of the opera school are very strict in all aspects: the age of admission is stipulated to be above nine years old and below thirteen years old, and those with an elementary school diploma are qualified.——However, those who have a very high level of opera, can also be admitted as transfer students from the age of fourteen to eighteen. Before admission, those who pass the examination must prepare three kinds of documents: a contract, a voluntary application, and a guarantee, stating the length of study, that they must not drop out halfway, and that they must fulfill their obligations to perform opera before and after graduation, and abide by these rules absolutely. After admission, students live on campus all year round and have no freedom to go out of the school; even if there are important matters that require them to go home, the parents or guarantor should fill out a certificate at the school according to the rules, which will only be valid after being approved by the school. Because, in addition to providing their own clothes and shoes, the school not only does not charge tuition fees, but also provides all food, accommodation, and book fees; therefore, the school rules are very strict and should be absolutely obeyed.</p>
<h3>Hou Yulan</h3>
<h3>Ah Q and Mrs. Zhang</h3>
<p>— Xi Tong</p>
<p>I watched the pre-performance of Ah Q Zhengzhuan (The True Story of Ah Q), adapted and directed by Xu Xingzhi, by the Sino-French Theater Society at the Lafayette Garden on the 14th evening. Sometimes Ah Q or the local tyrant would enter the stage from the aisle between the audience seats, which was quite novel and interesting; it has been almost thirty years since I last saw this kind of performance. Only when I was about ten years old did I see the Xia brothers and Mao Yunke's "New Camellia" at the Nine Mu Di Stage, where in the end the city wall was burned, and a team of soldiers crossed from under the stage to the stage.</p>
<p>After reading Xu Xingzhi's confession in the special issue of the play, I know that the author has been brewing this play for ten years, which shows how much effort he has put into it. I heard that he had extensively visited enthusiasts of popular literature just to determine what tune should be used for the song sung by Wu Ma at the beginning of the second act. From this rigorous spirit, he can be compared to the French naturalists who personally visited patients with snake bites.</p>
<p>In order to make the structure of the script tighter, and also to exaggerate the hypocrisy and crimes of the local tyrants and evil gentry, the author made Zhao Taiye commit adultery with Wu Ma, and also let the Fake Foreign Devil hook up with the young nun, and finally put their own crimes on Ah Q. Although this plot is not in Lu Xun's original work, this treatment is clever and more dramatic. However, since it is for a tighter structure, why put Kong Yiji from "Kong Yiji" and the story of Xiao Xi from "Medicine" in as well? I think these two segments, which are irrelevant to the theme and are not in The True Story of Ah Q, can be deleted; not only can the structure be tighter as a result, but it can also save time and reduce audience fatigue.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, Wang Xianzai's local tyrant and Xu Xinyuan's Zhao Taiye are veteran craftsmen in the film industry and are rich in experience, so they are extraordinary. Wang Zhuyou's Ah Q and Lu Ji's Wu Ma also performed extremely well, and almost all the others, such as Hua Rong, Yang Fan, Lu Shan, Zhou Qi, Hong Dou, Li Qing, and Lai Jinming, were excellent. However, the young nun should also wear a hat, just like the old nun. The singing lines of the dragon and tiger fight seem disharmonious when using the Shaoxing tune, it is better to use the current Beijing flavor, because the dialogue is also in Mandarin.</p>
<p>On the 15th evening, I watched the Midnight Theater Society perform "Mrs. Zhang's Dream," adapted and directed by Wu Xiaobang. The actors Ruan Min and Fei Falcon are the children of a famous writer; I can't help but feel the swift passage of time, and now it is the time for "Little Heroes of the Tang Dynasty" to be born. This play is purely a fable, and the appearances of Mu Zi's Heath and Xian's Souslin are very similar. Mu Jinsheng should wear a military uniform with a black cloak; now he is wearing a wide-sleeved black long gown, which is easy to be confused with Ala Gong, thus increasing the comedic effect, which is not necessarily a bad thing. When it came to epigrams, the audience applauded repeatedly, which shows that this play is very meaningful.</p>
<p>Ah Q is a representative of the weaknesses of the Chinese national character, he is non-resistant; while Qiang Sheng in "Mrs. Zhang's Dream" is a symbol of the new China, refusing to yield and determined to resist to the end.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The long head covering used by female roles was created by Mei Qiaoling</p>
<p>Qiaoling was chubby, so she was called Fatty Qiaoling at the time. In her later years, she had already retired from the opera stage and rarely performed, but driven by her charitable heart, she would see her poor colleagues without clothes or food at the end of each year, and felt that the situation was really miserable. Therefore, she would often take the initiative to organize one or two "wowo tou" opera performances (poor families in Peiping all eat "wowo tou" made of corn flour, because it is cheap). She would invite other famous actors to participate, and the ticket proceeds would be used entirely to help poor colleagues. In addition, she would not refuse any requests for helping friends with stage performances or for charitable performances for local public welfare. Therefore, there were indeed many people who praised her at the time. But the difficulty was that as she grew older, the wrinkles and forehead lines on her face increased day by day, and became longer and deeper. An old man with a face full of chicken skin singing a "hua dan" role (Qiaoling was famous for playing "hua dan") was somewhat different from a pure singing "qing yi" role, and he himself felt too embarrassed when he dressed up. Therefore, he invented an artificial remedy. Whenever he dressed up for a performance, he would use a long, five- or six-foot black gauze head covering. When he was doing his makeup in front of the mirror, he would instruct the hairdresser to pull the head covering tight. While he used both hands to push and rub the wrinkles and forehead lines upward, the hairdresser standing behind him would unfold the head covering and lift it up once, and then use the gauze head covering to tightly wrap it around once, repeating this several times until all the wrinkles on his face were gone. Imagine that at his age, he was willing to endure such pain to plead for the poor; this kind of merit is really not small. Amateur performers who don't perform often sometimes faint on stage from wearing a water gauze head covering, let alone an elderly person who is so tightly wrapped. How could they not feel dizzy and have a headache? ——(61)——</p>
<h3>"Wang Baochuan" is Finalized: The Lead Female Role Still Belongs to Zhang Cuihong</h3>
<p>— Yinyi</p>
<p>Xue Pinggui is Remodeled as a Hero of Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>Yi Hua Film Company is actively producing the costume film "Wang Baochuan." The scenes of Xue Pinggui and Princess Daizhan are almost coming to an end. Xue Pinggui is played by Li Ying, and the role of Princess Daizhan once caused a competition between Zaiyang and Gu Han. In the end, it was changed to be played by Diao Banhua. Diao Banhua took a lot of "military uniform and sword" photos, and her heroic spirit is no less than that of Chen Yunshang in "Mulan Joins the Army."</p>
<p>The female lead Wang Baochuan was originally intended by Yi Hua from the beginning to be the "classical beauty" Zhang Cuihong. Later, because Zhang Cuihong's "husband" did not want his wife to appear on the screen again and expressed a "firm refusal" to Yi Hua, Yi Hua had to think of other ways. Yan Youxiang, the young owner of Yi Hua, personally went to Hong Kong to prepare to invite Li Qinian, the leading actress of Nanguo, to Shanghai, but he did not succeed. After Yan Youxiang returned to Shanghai, he continued to negotiate with Zhang Cuihong. Zhang Cuihong and her "husband" felt a little embarrassed by Yi Hua's sincerity, so they accepted Yi Hua's invitation. Now, the role of Wang Baochuan has finally been decided.</p>
<p>On the day Shanghai was hit by the storm, the Wujiapo set at Yi Hua's studio was blown away by the wind, so filming was suspended for two days. Later, it was rebuilt, and this scene has now been completed. According to Wu Cun, Xue Pinggui on the screen will be completely transformed into a hero of resistance against Japan, which is completely different from Xue Pinggui in the stage play "Red Mane Stallion." In this way, the doubts from the outside world about "Wang Baochuan" being brought to the screen can be dispelled.</p>
<h3>Silver Screen Report</h3>
<p>— (Yindi)</p>
<p>Li Pingqian introduced foreign stage plays to the screen. In the past, there were "Camille" and "Lady Windermere's Fan." Now, the Golden and Silver World, which is being shown at the New Guang Grand Theatre, is the third one. The next film after this one has been decided, named "Sheng Si Hen" (Love Unto Death), starring Chen Yanyan and Wang Yin, and is being prepared for filming.</p>
<p>Little Fatty Guan Hongda performed at the Dahua Ballroom on the 16th, and many dancers paid attention to him.</p>
<p>The virgin work of He Zhong Film Company, the costume film "Wen Sucheng," has been filmed to about 30-40%. Among them, the role of Liu Xuangu is still looking for a successor because Jin Suwen resigned due to illness. Someone introduced Ms. Gu Han (who has performed in dramas at the Red Star Theatre) to the He Zhong authorities, but it was not successful because the director Zhu Changlin disagreed. Now, the He Zhong authorities still intend to negotiate with Jin Suwen, asking the second Miss Jin to reluctantly take on the role.</p>
