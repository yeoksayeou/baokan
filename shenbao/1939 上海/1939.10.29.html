<p>社評</p>
<h3>語文展覽</h3>
<p>下月初上海地方將要出現一個由私人發起組織的語文展覽會。無疑的，一切關心文化運動的人一定很注意這樣的一個展覽會；並且大家也一定更抱着熱烈的期許，希望這個展覽會跟其他展覽會不同，會發揮着更多的積極作用。因為語文展覽是語文運動的一種具體表現，而語文運動是中國適應時代需要的文化工作中的重要部門；所以我們不但希望這個展覽會能夠打破目前孤島文化界的沉悶空氣，抑且希望它能夠表現為動態的，立體的；換句話說，就是我們希望從這個展覽會中發現着若干問題，或者竟是若干問題的答案，足以指示出當前的文化運動中正確的目標與路綫。</p>
<p>要了解語文的時代意義以及進展的必然性，必先認識三點，就是一，語文在歷史上是逐漸進化的，不是一成不變的；二，每一個語文的進步階段必跟當時的社會形態相適應；三，在社會形態需要發生變革的時候，語文的舊形式必然會妨碍了社會的進展，因此也必須有所改進，以期適合於一種更新更進步的社會形態。基於上述的需要，所以中國的語文展覽，應該充分指示出中國語文在歷史上進展的形迹，語文進展對於當時社會狀態的聯繫，以及每次語文進展所具有的理由；祇有這樣，才可以說明目前中國正需要着一種進步性的，跟抗建過程相適應的語文運動。</p>
<p>中國抗建過程裏的文化工作，最主要的不外兩端：第一，提高一般民衆的文化水準，至少要掃除全國的文盲，奠定建國的精神基礎；第二，通過了語文的媒介，用各種不同的表現方式，提高一般民衆的抗建意識，激發他們的抗建情緖。為達到遭兩項目標起見，目前中國的語文運動又必須負起兩種任務：一，促進中國語文外形的變革，使它更適合於大衆化，作為大衆的精神武器，或者說是接受文化的良好工具。二，促進中國語文內在的變革，使它更適合於表現進步的意識和進步的情緒。這種外形的與內在變革，都不是一蹴可幾的事，但是目前的中國却又迫切的需要着有這些變革，因此從事文化工作的人往往已經著手進行，以期於實踐中把握到更正確的理論。固然目前的新語文運動已經積聚着許多可寶貴的經騐足資採取，但是同時在事實上也已遭逢了許多的難題必須解決，因此現在我們需要把這許多積聚着的經騐以及遭逢到的難題同時展布在面前，加以分析跟檢討。如果語文展覽能夠担負起一種責任，就是應用科學化的方法，把現代中國語文運動的現象一一顯示出來，同時把所有及應有的問題也一一暴露出來，使目前中國的語文運動獲得科學研究的基礎，那可以說是一件極有價値的工作。</p>
<p>在目前中國的語文運動裏，有一個比較新穎而値得注意的問題，那就是拉丁化新文字的問題。自從中國文字改為拼音的問題被提出以來，已經有二三十年的歷史，至於拉丁化新文字方案，却擬議於民國二十年左右。據曾經試騐過拉丁化新文字者的報告：有「三萬餘兒童，四千餘成人，得到了優良的成績。」又據說「進步較速的，每日僅習一小時，三星期後已能閱讀新文字書籍，並作通順簡單文字。」可是去年三月五日的中宣部通令，却對於拉丁化新文字運動有所糾正，大致說拉丁化新文字既不利於中國的統一，也不便於保存中國的固有文化，並且又不合民衆的讀書識字心理，因此難於引起普遍的學習興趣。但是中宣部又說「凡此有待研究之問題，如不妨礙或分散國人抗戰之力量，在純學術之立場，加以研究，或視為社會運動之一種工具，未嘗不可。」所以現在有志於語文運動的人，不妨趁語文展覽的機會，對於這一個拉丁化新文字問題，作一番縝密的檢討。</p>

<p>華盛頓　據美國駐蘇大使斯坦赫德今日電吿、據蘇聯人民外交委員會副委員長波丹金曾對渠言、美商船「弗林特」號業已開往德國、至於美國水手之安全、則全無問題、美大使曾請波丹金、解釋其機器發生障碍之證據、及其釋放之理由、據蘇方言、蘇聯之行動、絕無可以訾議之處、因該船為一俘虜船、依照國際公法、不應久留於中立國之港口、美使對於蘇政府對美之缺乏合作情形、殊為失望、因此美大使曾要求該船及其貨物、歸之美國、但蘇方不應所請、唯水手之生命、則皆極安全云、（二十八日美聯電）</p>

<p>麗都足球隊、本週因西聯甲組賽輪空、特約英海軍聯隊作友誼賽今日下午三時交鋒於呂班路震且球塲、英海軍為去年乙組盟主、本季循例可昇甲組、乃因歐戰爆發、艦隊微調無定、自願屈居乙組、故其實力、自不在甲組各隊之下、而今日更集大不列顚駐滬艦隊之精銳、以抗麗都之雄師、其精彩演出、實在意料之中、麗都因健將吳祺祥尙未返防、實力未免較原來稍遜、但適與英軍聯銖　悉稱、更足以造成不少精彩鏡頭、以饜觀衆之欲望也、門票五角、難民捐在內、英軍陣容、因係集各隊之菁華、一時未易選擇、須今日方可排出、茲探錄麗都陣容如後、</p>

<p>教育消息</p>
<h3>戰事發生後　重慶教育發逹概况　各學校奉令疏散鄉村</h3>
<p>（重慶訊）重慶市位於嘉陵江與揚子江之交點為一小城、敎育頗為發達、戰前共有大學二所、（四川省立重慶大學及敎育學院）中學二十八所、內有基督敎學校五所、天主堂學校二所、職業學校八所、省立師範學校二所、其餘皆為私立中學、自戰事發生後、國府西移、學校更加發達、計共中學增加八所、專科以上學校增加七校、計中央大學、中大柏溪分校、國立藥學專科學校、文華圖書專科學校、中華大學·復旦大學·金陵大學·堪稱學校林立、自本年二月渝府嚴令疏散後、城內巳無學校、大都分布於長江南岸嘉陵江北岸沙平壩等地、以沙平壩一區比較更為集中、計有四川省之敎育學院、（獨立學院）重慶大學·女子職業學校·國立中央大學·藥學專科學校·中央工業學校·私立南開中學·及大公職業學校等八校、學生工作、亦以此地為中心云、</p>
<h3>倫敦大學　在華錄取新生</h3>
<p>本年六月間英國倫敦大學曾舉行公開工程學士初級考試、在中國參加是項考試而被錄收者、有阿加富諾夫·朱道弘·李學果·黃延元·盧濟祥等五人、此五人均屬雷氏、德學院高中部學生、據倫敦大學考試委員會中國分會幹事云、該項考試能被錄取者事已匪易、今該校竟有三人同列優等、非但英國方面及世界各地無此成績、即歷來考試亦所罕有、故該校除獲團體總分第一外、並打破歷來所有之紀錄、</p>
<h3>難童救濟教養的　癥結和改進辦法（六）</h3>
<p>— 錢用和</p>
<p>（五）提高師資及待遇　在南京淪陷時一般小學敎師、驟遭失業、敎育部舉辦小學敎師登記以後、各地的小學校、增加學級、需要敎師、保育院、敎養院、慈幼院、也吸收了不少失業敎師、惟上面那些難童敎養院是敎養兼施、就敎師經騐來談、有敎學經騐豐富的不少、有保育經騐的就不多、而且稍有能力的敎師、小學校早巳吸收去了、不得已來就敎養難童工作、出於志願熱心的固不少、出於靜待機會的、也大有人、所以難童敎養的師資標準、無形中就低落下來、再加工作緊張、待遇菲薄、優良敎師、更難久留、保育會在漢口曾招考一批保育院敎師、雖加以訓練、因為根基堅强的人不多、所以能得力的也很少、最近在重慶又招考一批、大都是暫時失業的男子、其他機關招考、他們又去應試了、這樣情形、難童敎育、眞如風中之燭、所以希望難童敎育辦好、第一應對於師資、設法訓練、同時應該提高待遇、使優良敎師安心服務、</p>
<p>（六）注重衛生醫務工作難童教育最感困難的問題、是大量的病童、因為醫師·護士·醫藥的缺乏、病童的死亡率就增加、因為設備、飲食的不良、病童就更多、敎師有醫學常識的、也祇能在工作上努力、於根本問題、仍難解決、甚至病童太多、連誣士也有累病的、醫生到院、沒有藥品、也是束手無策、所以難童教育、最要緊的是衛生工作、衛生工作分二種、一是預防工作、一是環境衛生、預防得好、疾病自然少生、環境淸潔、也就减少病源、但是各院往往藉口限於經費、以目前省費為經濟、結果所　更多、並目兒童受苦、例如夏令蚊子為瘧疾的媒介、各院為節省經費起見、或購蚊香、或略在門窗訂紗布、以為足夠防止蚊蟲、比蚊帳價格可以節省多多、實際兒童瘧疾蔓延、金雞納霜旣貴、又來源缺乏、一童吃一二粒、也不濟於事、手忙脚亂、東請醫生、西送醫院、每童所費、已超出於蚊帳的價格、但是蚊帳明年還可應用、蚊香金雞納霜都消耗了、甚至從辛苦搶救來的兒童、死亡一二個、這種飮鴆止渴的省錢、並非經濟的原則、致衛生署的醫師護士也不夠支配、如果各院衛生工作做行好、醫務工作也就容易、衛生醫務工作辦好、難童敎育的困難、已可解決大半、</p>

<h3>金融　外滙愈放愈長　國外資金回集上海　日商正金暗中拋出</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市情况、全盤處於鬆境、賣氣仍盛、尤以銀行塞出居衆、原因歐局關係、海外匯款歸國甚夥、故資金早有回集上海之勢、本報曾於數週前述之、半日過程、初受英美匯兌續跌之故、晨開即呈英鬆美平之象、嗣後港電拋出及投機商等力售、加之美行供意殊切、頭寸愈感充盈、鬆勢難挽、英金畏達五辦士〇六二五、美匯亦硬至八元四三七五、此後賣風雖已稍差、一度轉平、但不久外行華比等忽來猛吐、且聞日行正金亦暗中拋售、而匯豐吃胃吿淡、致步硬不已、英金最硬喊過五辦士一二五、美匯最鬆呌過八元五六二五、迄午收為止、英金為五辦士一〇九三七五、較上日長一〇九三七五、美匯為八元五三一二五、比隔昨鬆一八七五、半天交易尙暢、</p>

<h3>外幣下降轉劇</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、俱見軟弱、英美金鎊需要甚稀、下降頗鉅、英美金票均有供塞、巿况軟弱、香港票·法郞票供給較增、市况疲敝、新嘉坡荷蘭安南票炸需要呆滯、俱趨虛弱、坎拿大斐律濱票因美金票鬆動、跟踪下降、澳金票　　票供求稀少、巿况穩定、日金票交易未盛、晚市仍為一元三角一分四厘、朝鮮票供給較增、市况甚疲、晚市為一元零七分五厘、昨日市價、英美金鎊俱降二元五角、英金票降一元七角、美金票降二角三分、香港票降一角二分、法郞票降一分三厘、新嘉坡票降一角五分、安南票降三分、荷蘭票羅比票、俱降一角、坎拿大票降二角、斐律濱票降三角、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>貼現進五十元關</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、突再下低、每千元之貼率、巳破入五十元大關內、上午晨初仍站五十元左右、較之現鈔供過於求、午刻遂跌至四十八元半、下午仍少起色、續低至四十八元、較前日再降二元、錢業公會拆息勿更、早午兩巿均掛一角八分云、</p>
<h3>金價易跌難漲</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、塲內因週六祇半天行市、自晨至午、較隔昨猛跌四十五元之巨、初開首以滙市報鬆即跌十元、為三千七百六十元、且外滙繼續趨硬、故未幾錢兌業等吐售、再低二十元、嗣以港帮拉進、外滙轉定、重回高二十元、如是將達午刻、滙市又鬆、金號帮競出、雖某銀樓與某銀號曾代本地帮搜購、頭寸仍敷、終難挽住下瀉、至收槃巳為三千七百二十五元、並為當日最低價，午後塲外趨勢平靜、最後價仍與午收相仿、半天交易的千兩光景、銀樓飾金掛小五元、海關金等仍平</p>
<p>烚赤軋跌四十五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開外滙又硬、故人氣仍餒、開市即小十元、錢兌業售予金號三十兩、為三千七百六十元、旋以外滙續硬、且錢兌業及銀樓帮等等互相塞出、價再步小二十元、錢兌業吐予證券帮二十兩、價三千七百四十元、時聞外滙轉平、同時港帮趁低撈進三百兩光景、不久遂盤高二十元、某金號進證券帮四十兩、為三千七百六十元、此後因外滙復鬆、某金號頻來塞出、頓又撳小十元、金號吐予銀樓帮二十兩、為三千七百五十元、後雖某金號仍有賣胃、兼錢兌業等拋售、但某銀號及某銀樓紛代客方收買、致市勢一度尙定、盤旋於三千七百四五十元之間、十一時半後、外滙冉度報鬆、人心更虛、進者頓少、竟又步落二十餘元、證券帮售予錢兌業三十兩、為三千七百二十五元作午收價、結果比隔昨軋小四十五元、半天三十五元上落、査巳連降三天、共小九十七元、下午週六交割例假、塲外聞稍做開、價仍三千七百二十五元、現金號之金牌金售出價照烚赤較高十元、收進須减低二十餘元、現標金照掛牌金小五十元光景、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>首飾金亦掛小五元</p>

<h3>大條近平遠縮　印銀平靜</h3>
<p>二十七日倫敦電、銀市投機家賣出遠期、少數乘機補空、市面平靜、大條銀近期未更、遠期回縮三七五、紐的銀電美現貨續小一二五、又孟買銀電、印銀市况穩定、現貨勿動、期貨各降一安那、成交單祇二十張、</p>
<h3>證券　美參院舉動　影響上海債市</h3>
<p>證券暗聲、昨日市况先　軟、後挺俏、蓋以連日來市價沉悶、毫無振作氣象、人心漸形萎頓、頗有搖搖欲墜之象、多方壁壘旣高、勢不得不竭其餘力從事拉抬、且適當週六、照例下午買進者需俟下週一中午交割、中間有一日半之猶豫時間、以冀新消息之報來、故市價於下午丙戊種均抬出九元關、多頭一方明則從事抬價、一方則假手他人、從事出籠、此種漲風、若無正式消息為之培植、殊不易立定也、昨日經過、上午極為平靜、各帮進出亦稀、巿價開收盤始終盤旋於五分一角之間、故午收行市、除戊種略好五分外、餘則絕無上落、午後傳言、美國修正中立法案業已通過、多方抬價收入、空方亦起抵補、丙種出九元關、但又一轉手間從事出籠、一般隨波逐流者、乃疲於奔命、市價又演成高而復低、市價結果略好三四角、成交總數共計七八十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易成交南洋烟公司股一百五十股、價為九元三角二分半、</p>
<p>咋日衆業公司股市、略呈暗澹、價格幾無變更、潛勢則仍堅穩、上海銀公司股、中國墾殖股、及蘭格志橡皮股三者、為各股交易中之特色、怡和紗廠股於二十一元九角價下、亦稍有成交、</p>
<p>倫敦二十七日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、仍吿平靜、上下檔各種債市行情、均無上落、</p>
<p>倫教二十七日電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行巿一致平穩、祇古拉客林傍橡皮股續升三便士、為十六先令六便士、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗價日鬆</h3>
<p>紗市續疲、依然迂　下挫、蓋以環境不良、外匯日趨鬆動、人心凋疲、同時客方需要畏縮、華南方面、政府統制匯兌嚴格、港帮辦力大見减削、因之巿塲籌碼益感充溢、一般搶帽子又復作投井下石之舉、市盤愈難振作、幸原棉基礎雖見鬆弱、但下降程度殊覺和緩也、紗市當可支持一步、</p>
<p>現紗展開市塲仍屬渙散氣象、實際交易、寥寥無幾、搶帽子之流、鑒於潮流不利、外匯頻長、皆不敢多動、因之成交允稀、開價即跌十四元、二十支雙馬現貨價為六百四十八元、施以浮空抵進、市情稍回昂至六百五十一元半收盤、查半日成交八百八十包、行情二十支雙馬跌十元零五角、天女跌十二元、雙地球跌十六元、今日出口棉紗有二十一件運厦鬥、四十七件運香港、二十五件運廣州灣、七十件運海口、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>同行　六一〇　海州　四五</p>
<p>香港　一一五　內地　一〇〇</p>
<p>厦門　一〇　統計　八八〇</p>
<h3>棉銷停頓</h3>
<p>本棉交易又入疲憊靜寂狀態中、蓋以紗價日鬆、匯兌一再放長、人心受其打擊、各廠進胃全部閉塞、隻包未聞成交、花號方面、鑒於以上情况、意態闌珊、成交大為緊縮、僅同業進通花三百五十包、價為一百二十八元半至二十九元、蘇北到通花一千二百八十七包、又北沙來二百七十包、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、異常靜寂、昨日匯兌又長、紗價下降、廠方無意採購、同業亦不願賤價賣出也、新買賣未會做開已有多日、如匯兌繼續放長、則外棉交易將無形停頓至一相當之時期也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉巿、晨初因接得利物浦及孟買來電報漲而昂、日來布疋銷路頗見進步、因之同業交易殊為熱鬧、近日遠東方面較為靜寂、然歐洲交易尚稱活躍、昨日紐的棉收盤殊為堅定、較之上日又漲三五磅音、印度連同預測漲一羅比餘、埃及漲二十餘磅音、利物浦漲二三便士、</p>
<h3>糧食　降格相求　客秈居奇</h3>
<p>客尖自經某洋行停拋後、其</p>
<p>京蕪等尖來源亦寥寥、且江北尖更以兩地市價難以劃通、久已無到、自粳米昂貴、降格相求、尖秈銷路暢旺、市存因日有銷出、並見减薄、致一般心思俱屬看好、手中有貨者皆抱守待之策、靜窺良機、乘高出售、所以晨初開市、竟乏貨供應、而仰給者頓感向隅、徘徊市塲、急需者遂不惜高價搜求、際此客販即互相抬價爭先出銷、形勢緊俏、市面立升半元、若江北尖開二十元零五角、蕪湖特尖開廿元零八角、次至砶米十九元、但美景不常、即成曇花、蓋一般作客目前以價格旣貴若遇一朝到湧、市面必有回風、未免有虧蝕之虞、不欲多購、故一動即懈、反均袖手、午市形勢復轉平平、至於新粳市、供求相近、其高特貨因價貴銷平、無甚上落、常錫特粳仍開三十一元半、不過中市貨、本鄉店胃納意較濃、價增三五角不等、崑常蘇同等貨開三十元〇五角至二十七八元、茶種窰種及百哥稻、因市乏高貨、去路平淡、悉守原盤、無有榮辱、野稻亦仍開三十一元、羊杜尖初則相隨客尖並緊、惟後亦懈、收盤行情、比前較加半元左右、變元陳貨已薄、昨祗中决者開出二十七八元、新元去路亦屬不暢、巿乏變化、開高貨二十七元半、次至二十六元半、破礱落令平庸、昨全巿到貨祗由車輪運來二千餘包、成交統的七八千包、</p>
<h3>麺粉客盤高昂　麥價亦暗緊無已</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨雖値週末之期、而客銷頗形活躍、南洋帮港厦等處、需要頗佳、北洋帮進　亦不寂寞、惟各廠以原料步漲、國外來源無望、除本街零銷維持七元三角原盤外、對於整批客銷仍加限制、所以客盤高昂、聞砲車粉價須七元五角以上、天竹牌亦須七元四角至四角半、但不作正式市面、統市成交的有三四萬包、大都直接配銷、聞廠盤恐有續漲之望、今日有三千包運香港、</p>
<p>小麥　咋市依然暗緊、蓋自速日巿價步升以來、貨客居奇、非漲不脫、所以廠囤兩方、進胃均覺怠懈、市面亦難再事猛抬、結果由福新阜豐兩廠合辦常錫崑丹等麥二千餘包、及囤戶收進蕪湖揚州太平府等麥共叫五車、價為十一元一角至十元〇六角云、</p>
<h3>油餅　豆油尙難過小</h3>
<p>豆油市為來源問題、會醞釀多日、邇來簍裝油已相繼而到、大連桶油亦巳到埠、致人心大定、行情回挫、但因一部份到貨成本昂貴、售手不願輕脫、一味把持善價、大局仍難看小、昨市小半元外、計開神戶油十桶、價為六十九元、大連油二百二十桶、為六十七元五角、江北油二十四桶、為六十六元五角、烟歧油四百件、為五十元、靑歧油五十件、為四十九元二角、膠州油二百件、為四十八元五角、及白紋油一百聽、又桶裝二十桶云、今日有豆子二千三百十包運查港、又一百包運厦門、生油二千九百三十聽叉五百八十五件、運杳港、蔴油三百九十聽、高梁二百四十八包運厦門、</p>

<h3>圖統制蛋市塲無效　日商開始搶蛋</h3>
<p>英領已提出抗議四五次　所得答覆均為當加調查</p>

<p>先行入會</p>
<p>據三井會社之意、應由其先行擇蛋、剩餘者始由英美商行得之、該會社且欲佔英美商行對英蛋類貿易之什五、果爾、則英美商行之蛋類輸出、僅剩半數矣、三井會社不能遂其願、乃開始强行搶蛋、結果、本市日總領署接得抗議數起、英總領署業巳提出四五决抗議、所接答覆、唯稱</p>

<h3>不登高山·那知平地</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>我用這句成語做題目，想在小朋友面前發揮一些意見，這句成語近乎格言，極淺近易解，小朋友定能懂得，但其含義類為深度，不能盡照字面解釋，吾則就太平庸了。大家知道高山是很險峻的，登臨非易，未曾經歷過險峻崎嶇的山道，决不會滿意於平地的穩妥安全。現在試把此意義仲張開去。</p>
<p>譬如我在學生時代，只要一進膳堂，就間燒飯司務為難，責備其飯米太糙，小菜太劣，靑菜太老，魚淡而無味，肉絲獨多肥的。好像飯司務過意薄待我們，非立刻把他們治罪不可。後來跨出校門，服務社會，飯菜的供給可就更其菲薄了，因與上級同桌，遠不及在學校膳堂裹自由，只求塞飽肚皮去辦公，不閒亦不便批評飯菜之入味可口與吾？有一時期甚至發生胃病，方知學生時代的非議燒飯司務，是一種不應有的苛求了。</p>
<p>倘我不體騐一下社會生活，是決不會感覺到學校生活之安樂的。這便是「不登高山，那知平地」的一例。</p>
<p>會經看見一位小朋友不滿意於脚上的那雙帆布跑鞋，他要求母親給他買一雙皮製的。自然晶亮透光的皮鞋要比帆布鞋漂亮好看得多。但母親因皮鞋價昂而拒絕，那位小朋友生氣了，哭吵着，以不去學校上課為抵制，結果如何？我不知道。當時只可惜沒有一個機會，讓我領那位小朋友去到鄕下地方看看。看看鄉下地方的孩子們脚上所穿的是什麽？十之六七都赤着脚，有鞋無襪，已算寫意得很，但所謂鞋者，非補綻密佈，即有帮無底，有些甚至拖着大人的舊鞋去上學。若能給他們一雙帆布跑鞋穿上，那正不知要快樂到怎般地步呢！</p>
<p>我又親眼看見一個鄉下孩子偷穿了過年的新布鞋，被大人打得亂呌。實在覺得生長在城市裹的小朋友太幸福，太舒服了。可是對於飲食，對於穿着，為何還要不滿足呢？此無他，皆因他們只在平地行走，未會登臨高山之故。然而亦只須小朋友能去看看難民收容所，敎養院，棚戶裹的孩子們，就可以滿足起來了。</p>
<h3>不要停着不動</h3>
<p>— 潑林山司</p>
<p>在德國一根很古的鑰匙上刻著這樣兩句箴言：「如果我停着不動，我便要生銹了。」——多麽有意思，和令人警惕的兩句話！</p>
<p>英國名相格來斯登說：「你看那自然界是永不停息的，就算是我們的心房，雖然在熟睡的時候，它仍舊在跳動着；假使停止片刻的話，那不用說，死亡便跟着來了。」</p>
<p>我國晋朝的名臣陶侃，當他在廣東任職的時候，每天都要將兩疊磚頭搬來搬去，所謂「運甓練勤」就是這一回事。還有前面曾經提起過的格來斯登，在每天午飯之後，照例要劈一點鐘柴。這並不是他們存心要做瓦匠或者是火伕，不過藉此以鍜鍊身體，免得安逸慣了，將來不能擔負重大的責任。舉世聞名的俄皇彼得大帝，當他是太子的時候，他竟抱着不自滿，不安逸的態度，跑到外國的造船廠，造紙廠和鋸木廠和其他工廠裏去工作——當學徒。他非但留心觀察，而且認眞工作，受着普通工人之同樣的待遇，這種精神怎不令人肅然起敬呢？</p>
<p>馬爾頓說：「工作和運動，是診治孱弱最適當的藥物，閱居無事，則無論在何時何地，都能生出痛苦來，一切卑陋和罪惡都發生在空閒的時候。」又說：「一件事做到了某一階段，决不可便停止而認為滿足，應該繼續努力，達到更高的一步。在自以為滿足而小再求進步的時候，便是他事業敗壞的開始。」</p>
<p>因貪圖安逸或自滿於本身一切而犯了「停着不動」的錯誤的小朋友，看了上面所寫的一切，有些甚麼感觸呢？</p>
<h3>新年登高</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>明兒避難記之四十</p>
<p>到得撕盡了日曆的最後一張，更換了另一個簇新而厚的，發現了那紅印的第一張，分明是新年來了。不論在平時和亂世，它總是無知無覺，一年一度的到來，可是在聰明人們的眼光中，對於它有無限的感觸。</p>
<p>明兒被那恐怖的戰神驅逐到了千里外的異鄉。有了這樣美麗可愛的家鄉而不能安居，遠迢迢的飄泊在外邊，因此這年度的新年的光臨，在逃難人的心頭中是很冷淡的，還有什麽興趣？而對於窮讓僻鄉的村子裹，也引不起他們的注意，因為他們是度廢曆新年的，不管什麽國曆不國曆？古舊的風俗畢竟不易廢除。</p>
<p>然而新年依舊我行我素，不管人們歡迎不歡迎，終於來了村子裏的人們仍做着每日所應做的工作，一無動靜，不過它倒引起明兒腦海中的反應：「往年的新年，總是很喜歡的，學校裹放假，開慶祝會，玩好玩的遊戲，吃好吃的糖果…」這一陣的幻想如一幅五彩的圖畫，映在他心頭，徒然的帶着些甜潤的回味。「如今在冷淸淸的家中，沒有書讀，度難民的生活……」又是一陣煩惱而夾着辛酸味的憧憬。這個新年反使明兒沒趣了。不但是他一個人，合家的人都是枯寂的把這一天光陰挨着過去，而他母親也沒精打彩地被迫着幹那洗衣煮菜的工作。</p>
<p>「今天是一年的起始，我們到山上去走走，來點綴點綴！」父親這樣的說着，大家當然不的而同的贊成了。因此他們踏上了上山的小路。</p>
<p>走了的莫半小時的路程，明兒父親畢竟年紀大了，停住了腳步，在路旁的石上坐下來休息。那裹已高出了地面好幾十尺，那邊的村子巳低了下去，茫無邊際的大地，一畦畦的田劃分得這麼整齊的正方形，一方塊一方塊的凑拼了起來，鑲在地面上。田裏嵌着靑葱的菜，堤上綴着枯黃的草，綠的碧綠，黃的鵝黃，互相掩映得分外的奪目。迷濛的遠山，蔚藍的靑天，點點的白雲，朶朶的雲霞，這是幅大自然美的圖畫。巍巍的山峯，兀立在身前，益覺得自身的渺小，眞是所謂滄海中的一粟，這時明兒沈悶的胸懷，巳為之一暢。間或有一二聲的雞啼聲，從遠遠的村干裏傳遞出來，在那四周寂靜的曠野裏聽去，聲韻的和諧，音律的合拍，簡直是奏樂一般的悅耳。總之這大自然的美，是描寫不盡它的萬一，要身歷其境，才覺是樂趣無窮。</p>
<p>他們休息了一會，便繼續的向前走去，巳到了高山的山驚了。明兒更奮勇的踏上了山路。那路當然更崎嶇而峭了走上去便傴了腰，脚裏用了力才可踏上一步，不過路越是難走，越是峻峭，反倒引起了他們的興趣。努力！努力！往山上跑！那山上的枯草長得長長的，時時帶住了他們的衣服，暗示他們不要往上跑了。可是它們越是阻礙，他們越向上跑，人力畢意有限的，在山腰裹停住了下來，汗雖出了）身，力雖用了不少，回頭一望，另是一番新的氣象。那時夕陽將西下了，金黃的光彩，把高窩的山頭染成一片金黃，富監堂皇，光煥四發，這是大自然餽贈給他們新年的禮物，也是他們努力的結果，而且鼓勵他們不要頹喪，不要消極，要勇敢！要堅持到最後的一刻一秒！那麼最後勝利一定會到來，和那金山是一樣的燦爛！一樣的美麗！</p>

<h3>奶娘與狼</h3>
<p>— —阿維亞紐司寓言—</p>
<p>很想吃一頓晚餐，到處跑來跑去。它走過一個門，聽見一個小孩在喊，一個奶娘正在那裏駡他：「你不要再作怪，你要再作怪，我就要把你喂給狼吃」！狼聽了這話，就等待好機會。希望奶娘能够照伊的話去做。但是，小孩子並沒有送來。狼轉了一轉，只好走了。</p>
<p>它晚間又到這家人家去，它聽見奶娘掉了腔調，安慰着孩子道：「親愛的寳貝呀！好寳貝呀！如果狼來，我們把它的腦漿也打出來。」狼聽了這話，只好走了。它一面走，一面嘮叨的說：「人，眞是想不透的！說的是這一件事情，但是他的意思，却指的是另外一件事情啊！（趙易林譯）</p>

<h3>藍矮子　（六）</h3>
<p>— 哀黎</p>
<p>當時伯父伯母和阿立先就動身上高地去了。阿麗等他們走再遠遠的瞧不見之後，也就準備一切，開始實行伊的預定計劃。</p>
<p>阿麗悄然自語道：「我也許要遇到那些矮子，這是帶了錢袋去的好。姑母曾說我們見了矮人，一樣的要有禮貌，他們見了那小小的銀幣和銅幣，和他們那種消磨小樣的身材恰好相配，總也喜歡的。」於是伊憐了幾個最小的銅幣和銀幣放在錢袋裏，又帶了一片麪包，以備充飢之用，再把一柄傘和一本書放在那小提籃中，伊就這樣高高興興的出發了。</p>
<p>那森林中雖有很好的樹陰，但是白天的餘熱未退，仍然是熱洪烘的。伊先走了一程路，很為興奮，就越定越遠起來，分明已深入了森林的中心，只為伊初次獨行，一些兒沒有經騐，所以只是向前趕去，並沒有留心到沿路的目標，當然也想不到回來的路徑了。伊看見了那些曲曲折折的小路，一條又一條的來誘惑伊，伊以為這其間很有神秘性，也許能通到矮人們居住的所在，伊就毫不遲疑的走了進去。兩旁的樹上，常有松鼠在那裹跳來跳去，到得伊抬起頭來瞧時，却早已不見了。還有那些奇怪的野鳥，見有生客到來，就發出一聲兩聲怪呌，使伊止不住的心驚胆怕。在那厚厚的苔草中間，往往生長着美麗可愛的野花，又不時聽得近邊有清脆悅耳的流泉的聲音，却又不知道是在什麽所在。道四下裹的風景，眞是美妙巳極，伊的心上要不是被那藍矮人盤據着，那麽就是瞧瞧這些好風景，也很滿意的了。</p>
<p>阿麗趕了好一會的路，並沒有停過腳，末後就覺得疲倦起來；伊便自言自：「我還是坐下來休息一下吧。就是要趕回去，也得好一段路。這裹似乎是森林的中。了矮人們要是眞的住在森林中的話，那麼他們也許會到這裹來盤桓的。」　（未完）</p>

<h3>記即將來滬之王瑤卿</h3>
<p>— 知白</p>
<p>據說老伶工王瑤卿，已準定伴同乃徒王玉蓉南下，瑤卿此次並非來滬獻藝，不過南來一遊而已。滬人是吾能有眼福看他演戲，那倒還是一個問題。</p>
<p>王瑤卿為名旦王采麟之子，工靑衣私淑胡喜祿，不特劇學淵博，而且致力於舊劇之革新；發明新腔，改良扮相，瑤卿實為第一人。刀馬旦穿靴，戴夫子盔，亦皆瑤卿首創。更擅長編排劇本，當年隸福壽班，演「粉妝樓」，「德政坊」，「五綵輿」，「兒女英雄傳」，八本「雁門關」等戲，名噪一時。瑤卿入同慶班，與譚鑫培合作甚久，老譚演「探母」，「南天門」，「汾河灣」，「五家坡」，「打漁殺家」，「審頭刺湯」，「珠簾寨」諸戲，皆由瑤卿為配，允以「汾河灣」，「五家坡」二戲，瑤卿與老譚演來，有天衣無縫之妙。</p>
<p>瑤卿之藝，以刀馬旦為最精，今日以演刀馬旦專長之趙桐柵，（芙蓉草）即出其門下，此外瑤卿因入內廷甚久，演旗裝戲亦為一絕，瑤卿之旗裝戲，能根據宮廷王府派之打扮，學宮廷中人走路，維妙維肖，故其演旗裝戲之台步，能妙到秋毫，桐柵之旗裝台步，能負佳譽者，半亦得瑤卿之指點也</p>
<p>瑤卿息影歌壇巳十餘年，民十五六間，程硯秋組織鳴和社，出演於舊京鮮魚口華樂園時，程師榮蝶仙亦隷鳴和社，旋與硯秋發生意見，離鳴和社他去，程乃情商瑤卿加入合作，瑤卿入鳴和社後，為硯秋編排八本「福壽鏡」，八本「雁門關」兩戲，轟動一時，瑤卿晚年，嗓已啞不成聲，唱不能入調，但與硯秋演「雁門關」之蕭太后，仍能精彩百出，風頭之健，不讓梅巧玲陳德霖專美於前，此非瑤卿有眞實本領，不克臻此也。晚年以敎徒為樂，門牆桃李，不計其數，允以後起之坤伶，無不出自王門，此次應聘來滬之王玉蓉，為其最得意之女弟子，故毅然伴之同來也。</p>
<h3>卡爾登觀劇記</h3>
<p>— 吠聲</p>
<p>今歲卡爾登大戲院，因頭本文素臣上演後，居然突破歷屆新劇賣座之紀錄，於是連續排演二本三本，在此期間，日塲復演天雨花，龍鳳帕等本戲，致戲迷同志之酷愛齣頭老戲者，大有難得一看麒派傑作為憾，幸而天從人願，最近數星期內，因四本文素臣彩景行頭，趕製不及，乃僉議暫演齣頭老戲，以為過渡，於是一般具周郞癖者，莫不眉飛色舞，相的作壁上觀。筆者前承友人之邀，觀信芳之南天門曁鳳凰山，昨（二十六日）晚信芳所貼為烏龍院，余因日來本刊徐慕雲君對於烏龍院之金銀問題，頗有見地，而友輩之見解則又各不相同，遂決往一觀，以覘究竟。入座時台上方演蘆花蕩，于宗瑛飾周瑜演來尙相當穩練。周瑜歸天後，卽為鬧院，素雯之惜姣，踩改良蹻，說白淸脆，恰合婆惜身份，高百歲飾宋江，上塲之「大老爺打罷了退堂鼓，衙前來了我宋江」句，似須加以斟酌，蓋打退堂鼓，乃衙役小吏之事，豈有身為大老爺者，自打退堂鼓之理？又「漏了找房東」，試問烏龍院旣是宋江自己所建之房屋，又向何處去找房東耶？此雖小節，似應加以注意。</p>
<p>信芳接演下書及刺媳，由路凌雲飾劉唐，尙能稱職，惜赤髮鬼之赤字讀如尺字，為美中不足，信芳之宋江，當劉唐詢其「還認得小弟我麼？」時，一味含糊其詞，設想絕佳，蓋若自承為相識，則來人之名字，實一時難於記憶，但若竟謂不相識，則本人固被人譽為及時雨或呼保義者，似乎不應直承不相識，此塲殆可謂為信芳之絕唱，故台下觀衆，亦莫不屛息凝神，咸有觀止之嘆。酒樓上觀書與收金等表演，允能妙造自然，殺媳時由王熙春飾惜妓，亦蹂改良蹻，幾句與宋江之對白，爽辣非常，無怪移風社倚重之殷也。觀至此，筆者因有他的，致渴望巳久之斬經堂，未獲寓目，誠憾事也。</p>
<h3>記游府堂會</h3>
<p>— 在了</p>
<p>上海銀行信託部襄理游伯羣君尊翁昨為六旬壽辰游君平日交遊廣闊，而於京劇極所愛好，又為該行京劇社主席，事先該社同人，乃發起籌演堂戲。是日席設牯嶺路凈土菴。記者於五時前往拜壽時，塲上已演至游龍戲鳳，由莊孟文君去正德帝張雪貞小姐（即秋雲艷）去鳳姐。莊君演來甚屬不易。張小姐扮像美麗，無懈可擊。决為駡殿，程仲蕃君飾趙匡義，張亞孚君飾賀后，二君此道，極有研究，咬字行腔，均凖確動聽。下再由秋雲艷小姐演十三妹能仁寺一折，去張金鳳者為朱梅雨君，去安驥者為惲葆丞君。秋雲艷小姐，接演此重頭戲，雖喉嚨略啞，但念來依然淸爽好聽，做派武工一絲不苟。朱君扮相漂亮，歌喉淸脆，一舉一動，合乎規矩·惲君原工靑衣，近來則生丑各行，皆肯習練，此次反串小生，尙屬初次，雖不無生疎之處，但究是個中老手，演來極能表現戲中人之身份，為此戲生色不少。再次為珠簾寨，去李克用者為吳起東先生，去程敬思者為程仲蕃先生，大太保則由王品之先生充任。故演來彩聲四起。下為朱梅兩君鮑忠祥太太王品之先生合演之二本虹霓關都佳。虹霓關後為楊碩民與石秉庸兩君之六月雪，記者此時被邀進餐，未能觀看，深以為憾，然而遠遠聞聽，兩君之嗓，均極高爽，後記者再到前台時，趙堯年君蘇夏軒太太吳起東君之慶頂珠巳演數塲矣。吳君之大敎師，念北平之土語，淸爽俐落，精彩百出，甚為難得。下為周叔誠太太與吳起東太太之雙金蓮，周太太之唱與吳太太之做，可稱兩難。大軸為陳寳德君之定軍山，陳君為十餘年之老票友，靠把重頭戲此當是初次，然而究竟是老資格，與衆不同唱念做打，均極可取，惜乎無錫鄉音較多為其全材之小疵耳。散塲巳將及午夜，乃忽忽而歸。</p>

<h3>新片介紹　鐵馬</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“Union　Paciflc”</p>
<p>一種艱巨的工作倡議之初，一定有人盲目地反對，斥為夢想；同時，直接受到利害關係的，也定必出而從中阻撓。前者沒有深遠的目光，苟安於目前的一切；後者祇知一已的利益，而不知大衆的利益。「鐵馬」的故事就是敘述南北戰爭以後，林肯總統獨持異議，而簽訂溝通大西洋與太平洋的橫亘鐵道。興工未半，林肯總統遇害。金融家巴羅士擬操縱鐵路股票，暗囑流氓西德阻撓建築鐵路工作。公司當局乃聘用傑夫從事肅淸陰謀障碍，幾經困難，而鐵路告成。這里更闡明為了偉大的事業，公衆的利益，即是站在相對地位的傑夫和狄克，在生死與共的時候，也終於携手一致。—一雖然最後還是充份地表現偏狹的岐視有色種人的偏見，不過戲的主題在對於事業的信忠，與乎相對的雙方携手協力這兩點敎訓上，我們暫於美國電影還能有更甚的苛求嗎？「錦繡山河」中的傀儡是更好的例子。</p>
<p>西席地密爾的導演手法是以大刀闊斧著稱的。「雪山突崩陷，飛車穿火橋，」讀了這兩句廣吿，也該相信此片塲面的偉大了。不過我總感到有些地方是過於浪費，如傑夫（佐麥克利）狄克（洛勃脫潑里土東）和摩莉（白蓓蘭史丹妃）等擊敗印第安人之後，就可以結束了。後面「雪山突崩陷」的高潮再起，不但浪費，更破壞了戲的完整空氣。如果為了加强悲劇氣氛，就是摩莉受傷也足够了。去年「新水滸」公映，火燒白宮及海盜搶刦兩塲戲，同一導演者是用燭炬點上窗帘及一個遠景後「淡出」，在枝節的戲上，其實故意用大塲面是反而喧賓奪主的。</p>
<p>佐麥克利，白蓓蘭史丹妃和洛勃脫潑里士東都很優秀，特別是狄克攫款後，在摩莉家中和傑夫相見；傑夫捕狄克，摩莉設計放走狄克；及在覆車中攻擊印第安人三塲戲，更見精彩。</p>

<h3>歐戰專號　北歐形勢的鳥瞰</h3>
<p>— 方企</p>
<p>波羅的海的風雲</p>
<p>擊於芬蘭的態度</p>
<p>芬蘭已為北　歐問題中心</p>
<p>歐洲問題的引起是在波蘭，但最趨繞的局面仍在巴爾幹，而最先改變情勢的，却是波羅的海東岸諸國。波蘭問題現在須等待戰爭的結果再說。巴爾幹問題，大家都在想避免將牠觸發，（或者說，大家都想在造成於己有利的情勢後再將牠觸發）萬一觸發，則歐戰的規模就非擴大不可。波羅的海的東岸問題，由於德國旣諒解地不過問，其他列强又事實上無法過問，所以蘇聯以一面倒的姿態，先是和愛沙尼亞，拉脫維亞，立陶宛順利地辦妥了外交交涉，接着對芬蘭的交涉，雖然頗多周折，迄今仍未達到順利，但逆轉的情勢也未必會來。不過假定蘇芬交涉的結果，也是和蘇愛等交涉的結果相彷彿，波羅的海的問題，却也並不就完全終結，一則芬蘭是瑞京會議四國之一，四國會議的外觀，雖然只是重申中立，但看開會的時機，顯然連繫着芬蘭問題，蘇芬問題將來的解決，無論與瑞京會議的希望符合與吾，北歐四國總已脫不出歐洲問題。二則，蘇聯控制波羅的海東岸以後，為减少將來對德的磨擦，與德商定遣送各國德僑回國，這種民族問題的最了當的解決法，在打阿利安人權利口號者接受時，不免總含着隱痛。這兩項較小的事，其重要性也許不在幾個互助公的之下，但對未來且不加推測。且一回溯已成的交涉吧。</p>
<p>蘇聯與愛拉　兩國的關係</p>
<p>最早簽定的是蘇愛互助條的，成立的日期是九月二十八日，其交涉的開始也不過在前幾天。十月初蘇拉開始談判，五日就成立蘇拉互助條的，蘇立的交涉，經過較久，中間也略經波折，但十月十日也就成立互助條的。三的的成立統在半個月以內，條文都大致仿佛，其中如規定疆域『被任何直接侵略或以侵略威脅時，給與對方一切援助，包括軍事援助在內』。『蘇聯承允在有利條件下，以軍械及其他軍事設備援助某國陸軍』。『兩國承允不締結或參加敵對締的國之一之任何同盟或集團』。『本公的之實施不得以任何方式影響兩締的國之主權……仍為某國領土』。以及期限，成立，等條文都完全一樣。蘇愛，蘇拉公的的第三條，蘇立公的的第四條，是規定在各該國駐軍的，前兩的對駐兵地是列舉的，計有薩萊馬島，希烏馬島，巴狄斯基鎭（以上愛境）里巴買，樊茨比爾斯（以上拉境）駐兵設防辨法也略有不同。後一的中未訂明。蘇立公的中多二條，一為第一條『……蘇聯允將維爾諾市及省讓與立陶宛共和國……』（原波蘭所奪，面積的一萬另四百方英哩）一為第五『……遭受侵略時，兩締的國應立即討論因而發生之局勢……』凡道些規定，現在已大致實現了。</p>
<p>蘇芬談判雙　方意見分政</p>
<p>蘇芬的交涉，從十月十一日芬蘭代表團到莫斯科進行交涉起，第一次是以十五日芬蘭代表回國請訓為止。初步的結果是怎樣的情形，未有發表。中間有瑞京會議，會議結束後，芬蘭代表就又於二十二日重到莫斯科交涉，到二十四日叉回國誚訓。據一十六日芬蘭外長的演說『芬蘇兩國現行談判性質，至為微妙，倘不待談判有成遽爾發表消息，危險實甚。故此際對於內容，未便有洩露。蘇聯政府向我國所提要求內容，外國謠言甚多……可輕信……芬蘭業已表示志在和平，並願與蘇聯進行談判，但此非吾人凖備犧牲自由與生存之謂。……任何協定，凡可便利他國以吾人所不願之方式使用我國領土者，均非吾人所能接受，任何集團係敵對任何一國者，均非所願加入』。可見兩方的意見總還相差很遠。或者引出第三國來參加意見是可能的。</p>
<p>芬蘭的國土，有一三四·五五七方哩，略小於波蘭，却大於意大利本土，不過人口只有三百七十萬，至其他三國，愛沙尼亞是面積一萬八千餘方哩，人口一百多萬；拉脫維亞是面積二萬四千餘方哩，人口的二百萬，立陶宛是面積二萬一千餘方哩（維爾諾在外）人口的二百五十萬。這比較也是說明芬蘭問題所以較為複雜吧。</p>
<h3>地中海局勢的分析</h3>
<p>— 獨行</p>
<p>各國利害衡突的交叉口　英國在東地中海的優勢</p>
<p>自蘇土談判失敗，英法土互助公的吿成，世界的眼光都移轉到地中海上去。這個遼闊的洋面，原是古來歐亞菲各國爭戰之所；這次世界大戰爆發後，地中海又一躍而為决鬥的塲所了。地中海不像波羅的海一般，那邊厮殺的對頭祇有德波兩國，它的局面錯綜複雜，是英法意土等各國利害衝突的十字路口。</p>
<p>沿岸巡羅</p>
<p>現在我們且在沿岸作一巡邏，自戰事發作後，埃及遂即動員二萬多員兵，應援英國；利比亞在意軍撤退以前，有十二萬兵：法屬摩洛哥和阿爾基亞（Algeria）是法國的倉庫，也是作戰人力的取給處。從南岸跨到北岸，情形又比較複雜一點了。法國接近意國的兩個海軍根據地——吐倫（Toulon）和維拉弗朗加（VilIefranche），一面保護法國和菲洲的交通，一面又威脅着意大利沿海都市。</p>
<p>此外，位在地中海極東的蘇彝士運河，地中海中途的瑪爾泰島，希臘周圍的島嶼，黑海的出入口達丹尼爾海峽，更布成一個複雜的網，充滿了危險性和爆炸性。</p>
<p>英國戰略</p>
<p>當一九三五年意阿戰爭時，英國在地中海的地位曾一度發生動搖，因為她在瑪爾泰的軍港極易遭受意國空軍和潛水艇的襲擊；後來英國加速在亞力山大港建築偉大的海軍根據地，以代瑪爾泰港，才算把她在地中海的地位穗定下來。英國海軍在地中海的戰略，簡言之，係根據下面四個原則：（一）法國須在西地中海保有一大艦隊，配備抵抗潛艇的最新式防禦，以確保其與菲洲的交通，（二）英國在東地中海設立强大的艦隊，並利用希臘附近各島，則意大利艦隊必不敢擅離其根據地，因為（三）意大利艦隊若出來向東攻擊英艦隊，則法國艦隊即可自後直搗巢穴，若望西攻擊法海軍，則英艦隊即可自東以拊其背；（四）切斷意國與利比亞的交通。</p>
<p>如果意國眞的維持中立，則北菲人力物力的接濟，自可源源輸入法國，同時英法更可自由給予土耳其，羅馬尼亞，及希臘以援助。</p>
<p>土國地位</p>
<p>至於土耳其，她有一百二十萬的軍隊，有優良的兵工廠，有四百五十架飛機，她的海軍，在黑海中更可稱雄一世，可與敵人一較高下，達丹尼爾海峽自設防以來，佈置在那邊的大砲都是德國的最新出品，她的高射砲都是歐洲各大名廠製造的。土耳其不但控制了達丹尼爾海峽，並且蘇彝士運河，紅海，和希臘，戰時都在她的勢力範圍之內。所以自戰事發生以來，德國和蘇聯對於土耳其拉攏甚力；又因為她是巴爾幹半島最强大的背景，所以德國駐土大使巴本在土耳其的活動之烈，實是人所皆知的事。現在英法土互助公的業巳完成，暫時穩定巴爾幹半島的大勢，同時給予羅馬尼亞一個撑腰；而英國也已確立其在東地中海的優勢，土耳其和希臘自然不慮仟何來自海上的攻擊了。</p>

<h3>英法德三國　情報主任</h3>
<p>— 菊</p>
<p>戰時的新聞作用有三：第一是使敵人的士氣沮喪，第二是鼓勵奮發自己的軍隊，第三是給中立者以良好的印象。上决大戰參戰國的宣傳機關負着這三種使命，這决歐戰當然也並不例外。附照是英法德三國現任的情報主任。</p>
<p>右為英國情報主仟麥克美倫，現年六十六歲，甘四歲時，巳在蘇格蘭執行律師業務，廿七歲為法律評綸報編輯。現在張伯倫給他這個要職，希望他愼選戰時的消息，目下新聞檢査處巳經成立了。</p>
<p>中為法國情報主任吉羅陀，他在卅九歲的時候曾著一部小說，為現代法國最饒興趣的創作，風行一時。現年五十六歲。</p>
<p>左為德國宜傳部長戈培爾，他的職務，自然繫多，新聞也在其統制之下。去年他歌頌希特勒的功德說：「歐戰後最無援助之德國，在五年以內，已變為世界上軍力最强之國家。」會有一時，報上盛傳他因調情電影女明星而被毆。這位大名鼎鼎的戈部長，不比其他二位，比較陌生，原來在德國，宣傳幾乎比任何事都視為重要，上决大戰德國失敗後，不歸咎於軍事，却以為宜傳不及他人所致。當時興登堡將車說：「敵人使我們的精神中毒，他的航空人員所發下來的小傳單是來誅戮我們的靈魂的。且侵略者一定要「鼓其如簧」之舌以淆聽聞的」，此即德國重視宜傳機關的原因，於是其宜傳部長亦格外為人所熟悉了。</p>
<p>麥克美倫　吉羅陀　戈培爾</p>
<h3>戰爭的幸運兒　一夜成名的新聞記者（士）</h3>
<p>大戰爆發了，戰爭的進展，又變為各項新聞紙每天的大標題，而如何獲得戰事新聞，不但為各個報館的主要目標，並且也是每個戰地通訊員所努力的對象。到了這僩時候，一個在前綫的新聞記者，也像在前綫指揮軍馬的重要將領一樣，極受人注意。</p>
<p>這次歐戰中，美國却有幾個新聞記者，以偶然在華沙的機會，出了風頭。一個是李却莫雷，他是支加哥每日新聞主筆史各德莫雷的兒子，那位著「德國把時針反撥」，及去年曾到中國而著有「莫雷在中國」一書的著者艾德加莫雷的姪兒。他的去華沙，要感謝意國當局的驅逐出境，說他「造謠」。波蘭戰爭趨於緊張後，曾有一時說他失蹤。隔了兩天，他終於在羅馬尼亞出現，而在支加哥「每日新聞」上發表他的蘇聯占領波蘭的詳細報吿。他說波蘭到羅馬尼亞，曾吃了不少的苦。他在昏夜中，泅過了丹尼斯特河，翻過峻崖，始達羅境。他的入羅國後的第一件事，自然是找一個最近的電報局，發他的動人消息呀！</p>
<p>另外還有一個美聯社的記者呌做小貝蒂。他也是從華沙逃到羅國首都布却萊斯特的。他除開隨身衣服而外，沒有帶一件東西。這兩個人在波羅兩國所採訪的戰事消息，現已在美國報紙上每日用大字標題登載，而變為美國人所極注意的新聞界人物了。</p>
<h3>被德國潛艇擊沉的　英國航空母艦勇敢號</h3>
<p>九月十八日在愛爾蘭海岸西北被德國潛水艇所擊沉的英國航空母艦勇敢號（見左圖），是一九一七年所造，本為巡洋艦，後改航空母艦，排水量二萬二千五百噸，可載飛機四十八架。艦面裝置着四·七英寸口徑的高射砲十六鬥，每小時的速度為三十海里半。裝甲最厚的地方，也不過三英寸，實際上與七千噸的巡洋艦裝甲差不多。故一遭潛艇襲擊，即致命中，於三十分鐘內，即吿沉沒。全艦有海軍官員一千二百六十人，船被襲擊時，艦上官員皆躍入水中，不能游水者，挾木板與俱，英國巡洋艦聞訊，即往救人，並有英商船及美荷商船亦往事助。結果生還者七百五十九人，失踪者也有五百零一人。損失不可謂不大。</p>
<p>又勇敢號之姊妹艦為光榮號，亦為二萬五千噸之航空母艦云。</p>
<p>英京六十五萬兒童　疏散至安全區域</p>
<p>關於戰時疏散兒童至安全區域之種種準備，要當以英京倫敦最為完善，其計劃係將英京學童六十五萬名，仍按學校為單位，分別疏散至安全區，居住於指定之鄉村家庭，並按兩班制，由鄕村學校敎育之。在對德宣戰的前兩天，即星期五的早晨，所有學童，都巳凖備就緖，列隊進校，受最後一課，然後搭第一班免費火車，前往指定地點，到達後，各人即以早經發給之郵片，寄交各人家中，藉報平安。又各人服裝上一律縫有本人姓名住址，綜計倫教曁其餘二十八城巿之學童，均係於最短速期內，疏散完畢。在疏散時，此輩爛漫天眞之學童，大都欣然就道，其間有面現戚容或哭泣者，則因家人前來送行，致不無留戀也，然此僅最少數耳。左圖即為倫敦學童疏散時之情形。</p>
<h3>歐戰中的無綫電播音戰</h3>
<p>— 微</p>
<p>極盡宣傳攻擊的能事</p>
<p>二次歐洲大戰爆發以來，西部戰綫雖還不見到怎樣激烈的戰爭，但是雙方利用傳單，小冊，允其是無綫電，互相攻擊，極其能事，這就是所謂宜傳戰，思想戰，——不可見的無形的戰爭，却無時無刻不在激烈地進行着。</p>
<p>不可見的戰爭</p>
<p>無綫電波是沒有國境的，無法檢査，無法攔阻，只要有一架短波收音機便可收受世界任何國家的播音。只要有一所强力播音台，便可對世界任何地方，允其是敵國境內，作種種利己的宜傳。這是最有效的攻擊武器，所以在平時各國無不致力於播音設備的充實，而在戰爭時，就加以充分有效的利用。</p>
<p>現在世界各國利用短波無綫電作定期播音的，計三十八國，電台總數，達三百四十，其中最有力的不消說是德、意、英、法、美、蘇六國，都有幾十甚至幾百基羅華脫的大電力，而用幾國—至少六國—的語言播音。</p>
<p>大家利用電台</p>
<p>希特勒對波蘭宜戰，當天就是一篇演說，題為「非戰即死！」借强力電波向全世界播送。其後張伯倫對德宣戰的悲痛演說，英皇喬治六世的演說，法總理達拉第說的「法國國民！應為名譽自由而奮起！」的一篇演說，以及戈林在柏林近郊軍需工塲的演說，都是藉無綫電廣播於世界的。</p>
<p>他們都表明自己是愛好和平的，把戰爭責任轉嫁對方。同時若在不利於己的消息，便竭力加以辯護，表示自己的正直，例如英國曾有一度播音，說「在丹麥投下炸彈的飛行機，今知為英國機，特向丹麥政府道歉。」對於任何有可以損失利己的消息，必竭力加以渲染，例如一愛西尼亞號，被德潛艇擊沉事件」，英國就向美國廣播說「德潛水艇不加警吿把該船擊沉，美國乘客多數遭難。」一方德國則說「該船是英國欲把美國牽入戰渦，故意用自己的驅逐艦擊沉的。」</p>
<p>各國宣傳特徵</p>
<p>同一新聞，各國的宣傳各有特徵，大概德國說話堅强有力而帶威脅意味，英國則編制老練，說話巧妙，德國有如高聲呌喊，英國有如兩人對話，美國則富於風趣，意國是戇直，法國是喧擾，蘇聯是冷酷，這就是各國宜傳風格不同的地方。</p>
<p>最有效的武器</p>
<p>無綫電播音除了宜傳作用以外，在戰時且可直接利用以作武器。這在西班牙內亂中，已有很好的試騐，政府軍和國民軍各有所屬的電台，傳達軍事上的重要命令。例如國民軍固守亞爾喀柴時因援軍出發的報吿，為政府軍電台所擾亂，未能收到，結果在援軍未到以前先自投降。同時政府軍又用敵方同樣渡長，傳送虛偽命令，竟吿成功。</p>
<p>其次是此次華沙播音台的爭奪戰，在德軍報告了華沙已被佔領的消息以後，不久，華沙短波台却宜稱：「華沙尙未陷落，我等仍死守中。」很使世人驚奇。據布達佩斯德電稱，自九月八日至九日，華沙附近有三個電台，以同一波長，進行猛烈的宜傳戰。一個用了德國音的波蘭話，說「華沙巳在德軍掌中，市民須速解除武裝。」但同時第二電台却說並未陷落，仍死守中」。每隔一三分鐘，便來一個完全反對的消息。直至華沙完全陷落的今日，在無綫電中，也還可以聽到華沙防軍里賓斯基大佐和市長斯泰定斯基的報吿。這就更奇了。</p>
<p>因為無錢電台是宣傳戰的最好武器，所以雙方的爭奪，比較一城市一要塞，更為注意，一旦破入敵方都巿，那第一個佔領目標，就是電台。而未佔領前，更是敵機轟炸的目標</p>
<h3>自天而下的　法國救護團</h3>
<p>法國在戰時雖沒有官方婦女服務團的組織，可是私人團體，訓練婦女以服務國家的却很多。其中最別緻最有趣的一個，是降落傘婦女救護團的組織，這組織是德乃門夫人所發起，經費也由她供給。她是一個勇敢婦人，喜歡運動，會騎馬，在一九三五年，獲得政府的執照，准許她練習降落傘術。在一九三六年，她組織了這別緻的降落傘救護團。法國空軍部，承認這團體為公益事業之一，並在緊急時機到來後，可在空軍部服務。德乃門夫人開辦時，團員只有三人，現在巳有團員五十人，並有後備團員二百人。她們都是自願參加的，所以包括各階層的人。她們學習降落傘施展的各項技術。團員受過三月訓練，即由法國航空學會加以試騐。以六個月為畢業期。</p>
<p>團員的主要任務，為緊急救護。所以一個降落傘救護員，不但要有救護的知識，同時也要是一個降落傘的能手。適合這樣條件的，是有了國家的看護的證書外，並需要有健强的體格，勇往直前的精神，與堅定的意志。</p>
<p>這團體訓練出來的人材，並不是作為普通看護之用，而是作為戰爭時，緊急救護，及特殊塲合的救護之用。她們可以這種救護員救護那些失陷在重山峻嶺中的將士，或與傷兵醫院隔開很遠的地方的傷兵。</p>
<p>自這次戰爭發生後，法空軍部巳命令這個團體，受其直接指揮，現在這批自天而下的白衣女戰士，或已在前錢活躍了。</p>
<h3>歐戰小新聞</h3>
<p>— 風</p>
<p>倫敦書店中，自歐戰後新出一藍皮書，這裏面有着官方的電報，演說及往來函札，大都說明這次戰爭，是希特勒為罪魁禍首。這書的鎖路很廣，每小時可售去一千本。</p>
<p>法國警察對個人行動，並不限制，惟每人出外，必須帶防毒面具，如不實行，將以罰款懲處云。</p>
<p>巴黎夜生活現巳規定至夜間十一時為止。巴黎商店門前皆貼有標語「早睡早起」及「我們有好的防毒室設備」等，以招攬生意。</p>
<p>自德蘇條的簽訂後，希特勒認為他所著的「我的奮鬥」一書中，有許多反蘇聯的辭句，足以損害德蘇關係，現巳通令各公共圖書館，暫停借閱。作為防禦坦克車用的鋼骨水泥陷齒，（高度為四英尺至十英尺）一當坦克車被陷齒傾覆時，埋伏於後方之平射砲即擊毀之。</p>

<h3>Foreign Affairs Association Welcomes Yu Bin</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Foreign Affairs Association welcomed Bishop Yu Bin, who recently returned to Chongqing from the United States, on the 28th. Over three hundred people attended the meeting. Chairman Shao Lizi gave a welcoming speech, and then invited Yu to give a lecture entitled "American Far Eastern Policy." Yu first analyzed the three major principles of American Far Eastern policy, stating briefly, "American Far Eastern policy has three main principles: First, with regard to China, the United States advocates the Open Door Policy and equal opportunity; second, with regard to the Pacific, the United States seeks to maintain naval superiority; and third, with regard to the world, the United States firmly opposes violence." Yu then described the US government's activities in following these three principles, and then discussed the future of American Far Eastern policy. In the past two years, the US government has painstakingly led public opinion, and has clearly achieved great results. Today, Americans are not only concerned about the development of the situation in the Far East, but also have a very clear understanding. The United States is a democratic country, and everything the government does must follow public opinion. The US announcement of the termination of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce is one example. At the end of his speech, the entire audience applauded enthusiastically. (Telegram of the 28th)</p>

<h3>Anti-Chinese Movement in Shan State Has Been Eliminated</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to recent news from Shan State (Siam), the anti-Chinese movement in that country has been eliminated. It is said that the Minister of Defense of Shan State, at a meeting held on October 9th, strongly stated the close relationship between the people of China and Shan State in the construction work of Shan State, and hoped that the overseas Chinese in Shan State would continue to cooperate in the construction work. The Minister also solemnly declared that the news about the anti-Chinese movement in Shan State was all based on misunderstandings.

<h3>Japanese Begin Tearing Down the City of Beiping</h3>
<p>Beiping: The city wall of Beiping, built in the early Ming Dynasty, is currently being torn down. Many laborers, under the command of Japanese engineers, are today starting to tear down the forty-foot thick and fifty-foot high city wall to facilitate Japanese development plans. According to this plan, the main street in the city, Dongchang'an Street, will be extended westward to the vicinity of the racetrack, creating a Japanese residential area. The road in that area has already been built, and the original villages are now being demolished. The main street will also be extended eastward, passing through the city to reach the agricultural area, as the Japanese plan to create their own industrial center in this area. It is said that the Japanese government is preparing to send 200,000 Japanese to live in North China. Observers cannot help but feel that the construction of "Manchukuo" will be repeated here.

<h3>The Xi'an-Chengdu Highway Has Caused Significant Changes in the Economic Life of Sichuan and Shaanxi. Cotton Production in Shaanxi Can Be Transported to Sichuan via the Highway. The Difficulties of Transportation in the Past Have Been Eliminated.</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to travelers who have recently traveled the newly built Xi'an-Chengdu Highway, the opening of this highway has caused significant changes in the economic life of Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces. For four thousand years, the transportation between Sichuan and the Northwest has always been blocked by the Qinling Mountains, which rise high into the clouds on the border between Sichuan and Shaanxi. Shaanxi Province is a cotton-producing area, and Sichuan Province needs cotton. However, cotton from Shaanxi Province could not be transported to Sichuan. Therefore, Sichuan Province had to transport cotton by boat from Hankou in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, passing through the dangerous Yangtze currents. Since the completion of this new road, this serious economic problem has been solved. Trucks loaded with cotton are constantly traveling along the road to be distributed in the western and southwestern regions. This year, except for a small area that suffered from drought, the provinces in the Northwest have had a good harvest, and the lives of the people are very prosperous. Xi'an has been heavily bombed by Japanese aircraft, but the residents have all hidden in mountain caves, so there have been few casualties. When the Japanese attacked Changsha, the residents of Xi'an, fearing that the Japanese might attack the Northwest at the same time, moved to other places. However, since the Japanese troops in northern Hunan were defeated, the Chinese have all returned to Xi'an and have greater confidence in the safety of the northwestern provinces.

<h3>Language Exhibition</h3>
<p>Next month, a language exhibition organized by private individuals will appear in Shanghai. Undoubtedly, everyone who cares about the cultural movement will pay attention to such an exhibition; and everyone will certainly hold more enthusiastic expectations, hoping that this exhibition will be different from other exhibitions and will exert more positive effects. Because the language exhibition is a concrete manifestation of the language movement, and the language movement is an important part of China's cultural work to adapt to the needs of the times; therefore, we not only hope that this exhibition can break the dull atmosphere of the current cultural circles in the isolated island, but also hope that it can be expressed as dynamic and three-dimensional; in other words, we hope to discover some problems from this exhibition, or even the answers to some problems, enough to indicate the correct goals and routes in the current cultural movement.</p>
<p>To understand the significance of language in the times and the inevitability of progress, one must first recognize three points: first, language evolves gradually in history, not unchanged; second, each stage of progress in language must be adapted to the social form of the time; third, when the social form needs to be changed, the old forms of language will inevitably hinder the progress of society, and therefore must be improved in order to adapt to a newer and more progressive social form. Based on the above-mentioned needs, the Chinese language exhibition should fully indicate the traces of the progress of the Chinese language in history, the relationship between the progress of the language and the social conditions of the time, and the reasons for each progress of the language; only in this way can it be explained that China is currently in need of a progressive language movement that is adapted to the process of resisting and building the country.</p>
<p>The most important cultural work in the process of resisting and building China is nothing more than two aspects: first, to improve the cultural level of the general public, at least to eliminate illiteracy across the country, and to lay the spiritual foundation for national construction; second, through the medium of language, to use various different forms of expression to improve the general public's awareness of resisting and building the country, and to stimulate their emotions of resisting and building the country. In order to achieve these two goals, the current Chinese language movement must undertake two tasks: first, to promote the transformation of the external form of the Chinese language, making it more suitable for popularization, as a spiritual weapon for the masses, or a good tool for receiving culture. Second, to promote the internal transformation of the Chinese language, making it more suitable for expressing progressive consciousness and progressive emotions. Neither the external nor the internal transformation can be achieved overnight, but current China urgently needs these transformations. Therefore, people engaged in cultural work have often started to work towards them, in order to grasp more correct theories in practice. Although the current new language movement has accumulated many valuable experiences to adopt, it has also encountered many problems that must be solved in practice. Therefore, we now need to display these accumulated experiences and encountered problems at the same time, and analyze and review them. If the language exhibition can shoulder a responsibility, that is, to apply scientific methods to display the phenomena of the modern Chinese language movement one by one, and at the same time expose all existing and due problems one by one, so that the current Chinese language movement can obtain the basis for scientific research, then it can be said to be a very valuable work.</p>
<p>In the current Chinese language movement, there is a relatively new and noteworthy problem, that is, the problem of Latinized New Writing. Since the issue of changing Chinese characters to phonetic spelling was raised, it has been around for two or thirty years. As for the Latinized New Writing scheme, it was proposed around 1931. According to the reports of those who have tried Latinized New Writing: "More than 30,000 children and more than 4,000 adults have achieved excellent results." It is also said that "those who progress faster, only learn for one hour a day, and after three weeks they can read books in the new script and write fluent and simple texts." However, the Central Propaganda Department's circular of March 5th last year made some corrections to the Latinized New Writing movement, stating that Latinized New Writing is not conducive to China's unification, nor is it convenient for preserving China's inherent culture, and it does not conform to the psychology of the public in reading and writing, so it is difficult to arouse widespread learning interest. However, the Central Propaganda Department also said that "All these issues that need to be researched, as long as they do not hinder or distract the people from resisting the war, can be researched from a purely academic standpoint, or regarded as a tool of a social movement." Therefore, those who are interested in the language movement may take advantage of the language exhibition to conduct a thorough review of this Latinized New Writing issue.</p>
<h3>US Senate Passes Pittman Neutrality Act: Another Victory for Roosevelt; Britain and France Receive Military Supplies</h3>
<p>Washington - After three weeks of debate, the Pittman Neutrality Act finally passed the Senate yesterday with a decisive majority of 63 to 30. Fifty-four Democratic senators, eight Republican senators, and one independent senator voted in favor. Opposing the bill were fifteen Republican senators, twelve Democratic senators, two Farmer-Labor senators, and one Progressive senator. Democratic leader Barkley delivered a speech before the vote, commending the senators for their calm and measured debate over the past three weeks. Should the House of Representatives amend the bill, it would be sent to a joint House-Senate committee to draft a compromise, which would be returned to the Senate for reconsideration next Thursday. The passage of the Pittman Act by the Senate was anticipated by informed sources, but the overwhelming majority was unexpected. This can be seen as a major victory for the government, and it shows that President Roosevelt's foreign policy is supported by a majority of senators. As for the content of the bill, while it repeals the arms embargo clause, it grants various advantages to the Allied nations of Britain and France, while imposing stringent restrictions on American commerce and shipping. Foreign observers here note that American public opinion generally believes that these restrictions are the greatest safeguard against the US being drawn into the European war and have decided to accept them. In addition, certain restrictions are placed on the rights of American citizens to travel to and from belligerent countries, namely: (1) American citizens may not travel on ships of belligerent nations; (2) American ships may not sail into the territorial waters of belligerent nations or enter war zones designated by the President; (3) Loans may not be extended to belligerent nations in any way; (4) Goods purchased by belligerent nations with cash must prove their ownership before export. However, with regard to item (2), American ships may still sail to the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, all leased territories of Britain and France within China, the Dominion of Canada, the Union of South Africa, and all territories held by belligerent nations south of 35 degrees north latitude on the American continent, but may not transport military supplies to the above-mentioned locations. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington - In yesterday's Senate session, the Neutrality Act proposed by the administration passed with 63 votes. This new Neutrality Act is what President Roosevelt calls "a path to peace," while isolationists call it "the first step" towards joining the war. This new Neutrality Act concluded after four weeks of intense debate in the Senate. If the House of Representatives can also pass it, the arms embargo clause will be removed from the neutrality laws implemented by the United States, and arms will be sold to belligerent countries under the principle of "cash and carry." The House of Representatives will begin discussing this measure on Tuesday, with hopes of holding a final vote on Friday, after which Congress can adjourn. Unless the President calls another special session, it will be adjourned until Friday. According to investigations by Democratic leaders, this new Neutrality Act can pass in the House with a narrow majority. The main contents of the newly passed Neutrality Act are as follows: (1) The arms embargo clause in the current Neutrality Act is repealed; (2) American merchant ships may not have dealings with belligerent countries, except for places far from the European theater of war, such as Australia, South Africa, and Hong Kong; (3) Belligerent countries must trade in cash and transport goods themselves when purchasing military supplies from the United States; (4) American merchant ships may not carry passengers to ports of belligerent countries, except for places far from the European theater of war; (5) The President may prohibit American ships and Americans from going to war zones at any time; (6) American merchant ships may be equipped with small-scale armaments; (7) American citizens who assist belligerent countries in any way are prohibited, except for relief work; (8) The President may order the prohibition of belligerent countries from using American ports, including submarines and armed merchant ships; (9) Foreign merchant ships may not misuse the American flag; (10) The clauses of this new Neutrality Act do not apply to cases where American countries are independent and fighting non-American countries. After this new Neutrality Act is passed in the House of Representatives next week, Britain and France will benefit greatly. They have already gained maritime control and will be able to obtain military supplies from the United States, and prevent German ships from going to the United States. (Associated Press, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington - After approving the repeal of the arms embargo by a vote of 67 to 22 today, the US Senate passed the government's Neutrality Act by a vote of 63 to 30. This is one of the most important victories the administration has achieved since taking office, as not only is the arms embargo now over, but the cash-and-carry system for belligerent countries to procure goods can also be established. The authorities expect that the House of Representatives will be able to pass this bill with a small but stable majority around next Friday. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington - Today was the last day for the Senate to discuss the clauses of the Pittman Neutrality Act. Once the discussion is concluded, the entire bill will be put to a vote in the evening. After the meeting opened today, Republican Senator Nye first proposed an amendment to replace the Pittman Act. The content, in addition to advocating for the maintenance of the arms embargo, was completely the same. The Senate rejected it by a vote of 67 to 22, which in effect shows that the Senate supports the abolition of the arms embargo. In addition, an amendment proposed by Democratic independent Senator Clark, arguing that armed merchant ships of belligerent countries should be treated the same as warships, and should not be allowed to enter or leave US territorial waters and ports, and that submarines of belligerent countries should also be prohibited from entering or leaving US territorial waters and ports, except in special circumstances designated by the President or Congress, was rejected by a vote of 65 to 26. Democratic Senator Wheeler proposed to re-submit for discussion a suggestion previously made by Clark to form an arms monitoring committee composed of two senators and two representatives, which was also rejected by the Senate by a vote of 50 to 43. Progressive Senator La Follette proposed an amendment arguing that the United States should not participate in various wars that do not directly threaten US territory or the American continent, which should be decided by a public vote, but it was rejected by a vote of 73 to 18. According to reports, 94 senators attended today's session (out of a total of 96), and many members of the public were in attendance. Most senators were eager to end the discussion, while the opposition was intent on obstruction. The proceedings were quite heated. Political figures say that in the past three days, all amendments that contradicted the government's proposals have been rejected, which shows that the Pittman Act will definitely be passed and enacted in the Senate. As for the House of Representatives, the Neutrality Act passed in the previous session differed greatly in content from the Pittman Act. For this reason, the House and Senate should form a joint committee to make adjustments. The main difference between the two versions lies in the arms embargo. It is expected that the House representatives on the joint committee will try to maintain a partial embargo. Once a compromise plan is drafted, it will be submitted to the House of Representatives for discussion. In general, the final text can be voted on and passed on November 3. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Paris - French Radio today announced the results of the US Senate vote on the Neutrality Act, calling it the second major victory for the Allied side in the war, the first being the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Rome - The Italian political world had long anticipated the passage of the Pittman Neutrality Act by the US Senate and did not consider it unusual, but it has made a profound impression. It is generally believed that this is a great victory for US President Roosevelt and the Allied nations of Britain and France. Furthermore, informed sources also believe that the US House of Representatives will definitely pass this bill, and Britain and France will be able to purchase military supplies from the United States, thereby enhancing their combat strength. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Although Chinese authorities here believe that the passage of the Neutrality Act by the US Senate has no direct impact on the Sino-Japanese situation, they are paying close attention to the progress of this case. Observers here generally believe that the passage of this bill is a major victory for Britain and France. Although Chinese officials have not yet commented on this matter, the general opinion is that the lifting of the arms embargo will be beneficial to Britain and France. Since the Allied nations have controlled the sea and possess vast financial and economic resources, it is expected that they will be able to make full use of the unlimited resources of the United States to supply the war. It is believed that if the war is prolonged, the effect will be particularly evident. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

<h3>Merger of Western and Eastern Ukraine: Establishment of Soviet Regime; Resolution of the National Assembly of Western Ukraine; Completion of Land Distribution and Farmers' Work</h3>
<p>Moscow - The National Assembly of Western Ukraine met yesterday in Lviv and unanimously passed a declaration to establish a Western Ukrainian national regime. The document first stated that the Polish state, which oppressed millions of Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Polish working people, had collapsed. With the assistance of the Red Army, the Western Ukrainian working people have been freed from the shackles of Polish landlords and capitalists, and have embarked on the free road to building a new and happy life, and therefore have the right to independently decide the form of national regime to be adopted in this region.</p>
<p>"According to the experience of all past revolutions and friendly nations within the Soviet Union, the Soviet regime has been proven to be the only regime that truly represents and safeguards the interests of the working people. Therefore, the Ukrainian National Assembly, representing the common will of the liberated people within the region, following the example of the various nations of the Soviet Union, formally declares the establishment of the Soviet regime in Western Ukraine. From now on, all power in Western Ukraine belongs to the urban and rural working people, and is represented by the Soviet representatives of the working people. The National Assembly also declares that all the people of Western Ukraine will resolutely support and defend this Soviet regime, and resist all attempts at sabotage, no matter where they come from. The National Assembly firmly believes that the Soviet regime, established under the guidance of the Communist Bolshevik Party, will surely enable the productivity, popular welfare, and culture of the people of Western Ukraine to develop and flourish." (TASS, 28th)</p>
<p>Moscow - The National Assembly of Western Ukraine yesterday passed a declaration on the merger of Western Ukraine with the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. The document first stated, "Under past Polish rule, the people of Western Ukraine only had the prospect of extinction. Ukrainian farmers were not allowed to own land, workers and staff were not allowed to join factories and offices, Ukrainians were not allowed to attend schools, the Ukrainian language was not allowed to be used, and Ukrainian culture was deliberately destroyed. Since the people of Western Ukraine obtained the assistance of the Red Army and were freed from the shackles of Polish landlords and capitalists, they have unanimously and firmly expressed their willingness to merge with the friendly nations of the Soviet Union at various conferences, and become part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.</p>
<p>"The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, within the scope of the Soviet Union, has become increasingly prosperous. Hundreds of huge factories and workshops have been established, where workers know nothing of exploitation. The economic status of Ukrainian farmers in the Soviet Union is strong, they control all the land, and they cultivate with new agricultural tools. The Soviet regime and the Communist Party have also created the prerequisites for the flourishing of a truly Ukrainian Soviet national culture. The Ukrainian dialect has been designated as the national language, and all leading positions in political, economic, cultural, and public life are held by Ukrainians. Ukrainian youth enjoy the full right to study in their native language and pursue advanced studies.</p>
<p>"All of this is well known to the people of Western Ukraine. Therefore, the Ukrainian National Assembly, representing the firm will and hope of all the people of Western Ukraine, resolves to request the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to allow Western Ukraine to join the Soviet Union, and to merge Western Ukraine into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, thereby reuniting the Ukrainian nation, which has been divided for many years, and forming a single country." (TASS, 28th)</p>
<p>Moscow - Western Ukraine, namely the Polish territory occupied by the Soviet Union, is said to have completed the work of distributing land. A total of 1.79 million acres of land have been distributed to 178,000 farmers, and 33,000 agricultural workers have now become small landowners. Furthermore, 175,000 poor or middle-class farmers have obtained more land, and tens of thousands of heads of cattle, sheep, horses, and pigs have been distributed. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Finnish Dispute: Negotiations to Resume Soon; Peaceful Resolution Expected</h3>
<p>London - According to news from Northern Europe today, since the Soviet Union's attitude towards Finland has changed, there is hope for a peaceful resolution of the Soviet-Finnish issue. It is reported that the Soviet Union has withdrawn its demand for the Aaland Islands. Political circles here generally believe that Finland will cede the three islands of Hogland, Suursaari, and Tytärsaari to the Soviet Union, while the Soviet Union will cede several small villages in Koivisto to Finland. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam - The "Telegraaf" correspondent in Berlin cabled today, commenting on the negotiations currently underway between the Soviet Union and Finland, stating that the Soviet Union is now eager to conclude discussions with Finland in order to be able to carry out everything it wants in the Balkans of Southeastern Europe freely. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - A certain newspaper here reported that the Finnish government is currently preparing a new answer, which will be taken to Moscow by Finnish representatives on Sunday. What Finland can do is limited to this answer, and Finland's "final word" is all in it. At the same time, it is reported that the Soviet government has proposed a revised military treaty to Finland. It is generally believed that this can be reconciled with Finland's strict neutrality. It is reported that Moscow has earnestly stated its willingness to respect the "neutral solidarity" of the Nordic group, and has assured Finland that none of its proposals are intended to harm Finland's independence. (Haitong, 28th)</p>
<h3>Estonia: Independence Not Affected by Soviet-Estonian Treaty; Communist Activities Strictly Suppressed</h3>
<p>Tallinn - The Estonian Foreign Minister delivered a radio address today, stating that recently there have been many rumors abroad, mostly claiming that Estonia is no longer an independent country, but this is clearly not in accordance with the facts. Estonia is still trying to carry out its ordinary life and has complete freedom and independence. The relationship between Estonia and the Soviet Union is extremely friendly, and both sides are able to trust each other. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - According to reliable sources confirmed today, the Finnish government is currently arresting communists on a large scale. It is reported that Estonia and the Soviet Union have established an agreement stipulating that if Estonian communists launch a new movement, Estonia may take severe repressive measures. The Communist Party of Estonia once sought help from the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union refused and said that if political unrest occurs within the Soviet Union, the ringleaders will face the death penalty. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Lithuanian Supplementary Agreement Signed: Defining the Borders Between the Two Countries; Lithuanian Army Takes Over Vilnius</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet Union and Lithuania signed a supplementary protocol here yesterday, detailing the national borders between the two countries in accordance with Article 1 of the agreement signed in Moscow on October 10 of this year regarding the return of the Vilnius province and city and mutual assistance, with the Soviet Union represented by Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and Foreign Minister, and Lithuania represented by Cabinet Minister Norkevičius. (TASS, 28th)</p>
<p>Lithuanian Capital - Soviet troops have withdrawn five kilometers from the city of Vilnius. The Lithuanian army took over the city this afternoon, immediately declared martial law, and notified residents to hand over all hidden weapons within 24 hours. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Rumors of Germany Preparing Large-Scale Offensive Against Britain; Britain Determined Not to Be Intimidated; Bad Weather on Western Front Halts Fighting</h3>
<p>London - The Nazi Party is cunningly spreading the news that it will invade England, causing the Allies to be quite suspicious. According to news received here, two layers of mines will be placed in the North Sea, allowing German fleets and transport ships to pass through safely. Shock troops will use parachutes to land in England, with the task of destroying bridges, railways, munitions factories, and power plants. Another theory is that Hitler is currently assembling 3,000 bombers, intending to launch a large-scale bombing of Britain, turning it into a wasteland. However, military commentators are dismissive of these absurdities, saying that Germany must have a forward air base to effectively attack England, as the voyage from Germany to England is beyond the range of fighter planes. Without fighter protection, bombers will be suppressed by British military aircraft and unable to wreak havoc. Therefore, people here mostly believe that the German army will sooner or later invade the Netherlands, as a preparation for attacking England. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Paris - The sudden change in weather is bad, and in several places the flooding is very deep. The Rhine River rose another two feet yesterday, and fighting has completely stopped in the flooded areas. However, British and French aircraft still flew into German territory five times yesterday to scout, four times over the German lines, and once 160 miles deep into German territory. German aircraft attempted to scout over Lauterbourg, but only flew in one or two miles. According to French war reports, artillery battles and skirmishes are even more active. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>London - According to a broadcast from Paris Radio, Switzerland is now rife with rumors that German troops are gathering near Schaffhausen, Switzerland, and building a pontoon bridge across the Rhine River. It is reported that the commander of the Schaffhausen garrison has ordered soldiers on leave to return to camp. At the same time, telephone communication between the Netherlands and Berlin is still mostly blocked, with only a few calls possible. The reason for this has not yet been announced. It is generally speculated that this is because the German military authorities are using the line exclusively. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3>German-Soviet Trade: Sharp Increase in Volume; Raw Materials Exchanged for Industrial Products</h3>
<p>Berlin - According to information learned from commercial circles here, the amount of trade between Germany and the Soviet Union will increase to 2 billion marks by the end of next year, with imports and exports each accounting for half. In 1937, Soviet goods shipped to Germany were only 67 million marks, and German goods shipped to the Soviet Union were only 117 million marks. Now, they have increased by 13 times and 8 times respectively. It is said that the main Soviet goods shipped to Germany are oil, cotton, ore seedlings, and timber, while the majority of German goods shipped to the Soviet Union are industrial manufactured products, machinery, chemicals, instruments, and electrical equipment. (Haitong, 28th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam - A Berlin dispatch from a certain newspaper here stated that Germany and the Soviet Union have reached a fundamental agreement on sending a large number of Soviet mechanics and workers to German factories for practical training, so that the industries that Germany will establish in the Soviet Union in the future can be operated by these people. After commercial transport between the two countries is already smooth, one-tenth of German products will be shipped to the Soviet Union. Then, the Soviet Union will replace the Netherlands as Germany's best customer. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3>British and French War Against Germany: Military and Economic Advance; British and Soviet Discussion on Barter Agreement; Preliminary Negotiations in London</h3>
<p>Paris - Blockade Minister Pernot recently gave a talk to the press, explaining the important mission undertaken by his department. He stated that the economic war and the military war are launched simultaneously. The main task of this department is to prevent the enemy from replenishing the various raw materials and manufactured products needed for combat. In detail, it can be divided into three things: (1) Closely monitoring maritime transport; (2) Preventing neutral countries bordering Germany from re-exporting the raw materials and manufactured products they import to Germany; (3) Various goods needed by the Allied nations of Britain and France, when purchased from overseas, should be purchased from neutral countries bordering Germany. Regarding the first item, in the past year, the goods imported by Germany by sea accounted for 32% of the country's total imports. It can be seen that if the fleets of the Allied nations of Britain and France can strictly patrol the sea, one-third of Germany's imports will be unable to reach the country. Regarding the second and third items, Germany uses the pretext that the Allied nations of Britain and France are imposing heavy burdens on the various neutral countries due to the current war, and assumes the responsibility of safeguarding the interests of each country. In fact, this kind of propaganda is difficult to convince people. France is currently working hard to facilitate the supply of various necessities to the people of the neutral countries, and is trying to maintain the industrial activities of these countries, so as not to damage their economic institutions. However, it is only natural that France requires each country to provide guarantees, so that the cooperation between France and each country will not indirectly benefit the enemy. The negotiations currently underway between France and the various neutral countries are based on this principle and are based on the most friendly spirit. They are also eager to ensure that the legitimate interests of each neutral country are not harmed. This is well known in each country. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>London - Responsible persons here recently announced that Commerce Minister Stanley has again held talks with Soviet Ambassador Maisky, to see whether the two countries can negotiate another agreement to exchange other goods in accordance with the previously concluded barter agreement (namely, an agreement to exchange rubber and tin for timber). This talk was of a preliminary nature, and formal negotiations will begin in a few days. Although the Soviet government recently protested against British inspections of contraband, commercial negotiations will not be affected in any way. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>Britain and Italy Adjust Trade: Agreement Established; Mixed Commission Established to Handle Various Issues</h3>
<p>London - The British Ambassador to Italy and the Director of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Commerce Department have signed an agreement in Rome stipulating the establishment of a permanent committee to adjust trade between Britain and Italy. This agreement aims to facilitate arrangements regarding the entire commercial relationship between the two countries. Italy and Britain have been trading on the basis of a clearing agreement for many years, but the establishment of a permanent committee is expected to provide a more convenient basis for trade. Italy's trade has been controlled by the state for a long time, and Britain has also had to establish various control committees under wartime conditions. It is reported that the British-Italian Mixed Committee also has valuable assistance for the economic exchange mechanisms between the two countries. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Anniversary of Fascist Party Taking Power</h3>
<p>Rome - Today is the 17th anniversary of the Fascist Party's march on Rome. Celebrations are being held throughout Italy. At the same time, the Fascist Year inauguration ceremony is being held. (Haitong, 28th)</p>
<h3>British and French Naval and Air Forces Mobilized to Search for German Pocket Battleship; Germany Releases Statistics on Ships Sunk: 115 Vessels in Two Months</h3>
<p>London – The naval correspondent for the "Daily Telegraph" stated today that the German pocket battleship "Admiral Scheer" has left the South Atlantic and rounded Cape Horn at the southernmost tip of South America to operate in the Pacific. Its location will now be even more difficult to pinpoint. However, even though the German ships "Deutschland" and "Admiral Scheer" are roaming overseas, they have only sunk two merchant ships, the "Clement" and the "Stonegate." German merchant ships have recently sailed from South American ports in the Atlantic and Pacific, suggesting that the "Admiral Scheer" has moved into the Pacific, following the same pattern as German supply ships at the beginning of the last European war. Judging from the movements of German oil tankers from Mexico and the Congo, it can be inferred that the "Deutschland" may head south to occupy the area vacated by the "Admiral Scheer." British warships, aided by aircraft, are currently searching for these two German ships. The British battlecruisers "Hood" (42,000 tons), "Renown" (32,000 tons), and "Repulse" (32,000 tons), as well as the French battleships "Dunkerque" and "Strasbourg," are all equipped with heavy guns capable of destroying enemy ships. While the firepower of ordinary cruisers may be insufficient, they generally have far superior speed to enemy ships, making it extremely difficult for enemy ships to escape once detected. (Reuter, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin – According to a German naval report, from October 12th to 25th, the German navy sank a total of 22 ships in the North Sea, Baltic Sea, and Atlantic Ocean, totaling 100,937 tons. Since the outbreak of the war, a total of 115 ships have been sunk, totaling 475,321 tons. (Haitong, 28th)</p>
<h3>New Belgian Ambassador to Japan Arrives in Yokohama Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The former Belgian Minister of National Defense and newly appointed Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Fosteau, arrived in Yokohama today from Honolulu. He told reporters that Belgium is currently striving to maintain strict neutrality to avoid being drawn into the war and will work to promote friendly relations between Japan and Belgium. The new Finnish Minister, Mr. Ittermann, also arrived in Japan on the same ship as the Belgian Ambassador. (Reuter, 28th)</p>

<h3>Anglo-Japanese Negotiations on Tianjin Issue Resume; Craigie Meets with Tani Masayuki; Nomura Consults with Abe on Anglo-American Policy</h3>
<p>Tokyo – British Ambassador Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki held talks in Tokyo last night during an air raid drill with a blackout. Local newspapers believe that these talks mark the beginning of preliminary negotiations to resolve outstanding issues between Britain and Japan. Prior to these talks, Foreign Minister Nomura had a two-hour secret meeting with Prime Minister Abe, reportedly to discuss the Japanese government's basic policy of adjusting relations with Britain and the United States. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" commented on Japan's relations with various third countries, stating that while British and American interests in China may have many commonalities, Foreign Minister Nomura will negotiate with them separately. The issue of free navigation on the Yangtze River is also one of the topics. The "Hochi Shimbun" reported that after a meeting with the Prime Minister, Minister of the Navy, Minister of the Army, and Minister of Finance, Foreign Minister Nomura made an important proposal at yesterday's cabinet meeting regarding the adjustment of relations with Britain and the United States. The newspaper continued that Foreign Minister Nomura, in a recent meeting with reporters, declared Japan's determination to establish a new order in East Asia, which will not be changed by foreign opposition or intervention. From this, it can be inferred what kind of policy the Foreign Minister will adopt in future negotiations with British and American ambassadors. The Japanese government will not accept any demands from foreign countries that would hinder the establishment of the new order in East Asia. At the same time, the Japanese government has no intention of trampling on the interests of third countries in China or obstructing the legitimate activities of foreign residents in China. Therefore, the Japanese government is prepared to accept requests from the United States based on principles of equal opportunity and the open door, as long as they do not hinder the establishment of the new order in East Asia. The newspaper concluded that the Japanese government is prepared to open the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers for general navigation once the situation in China returns to normal. (Reuter, 28th)</p>
<p>London – A Reuter's diplomatic correspondent learned that London has not yet received information regarding the talks between British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki. However, it can be said that the British government is willing to continue talks on the Tianjin issue with Japan at any convenient time. The British government has not sent Craigie any new instructions regarding this matter. If any talks have taken place, they must have been held in Tokyo. As far as is known, these talks are limited to the Tianjin issue. Talks on the Tianjin issue have often been held in Tokyo in the past. London may have had diplomatic contact on this issue, but it is not known whether the two sides have mutually agreed to hold parallel talks there. (Reuter, 28th)</p>
<h3>American Ship "Flint" Leaves Soviet Territory, Piloted by German Sailors; United States Negotiates with Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Washington – Secretary of State Hull stated at a press conference today that he wanted to obtain full information from the Soviet government regarding the American ship "Flint," but was completely unable to do so. German official radio now reports, "According to Moscow, the ship, after being detained by the Soviet authorities for several days, has now been sailed out of Murmansk by German crew members in accordance with the Hague Convention." The American ambassador to the Soviet Union has been unable to approach the American crew members. The U.S. State Department is not without criticism of the Soviet authorities for issuing the news through a news agency without first notifying the U.S. government. He still does not know where the "Flint" is in Murmansk, and he has not received any other detailed reports. If an ownership issue arises, the U.S. government is willing to attend a prize court. (Reuter, 27th)</p>
<p>Moscow – The American Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, went to the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs at 6:00 PM today to hear the Soviet government's explanation of the detention of the American cargo ship "Flint." The meeting lasted one hour, and the details were not released. According to well-informed sources, the "Flint," piloted by German sailors, has already left the port of Murmansk. The original American crew of 41 people are still on board, presumably heading to a German port, but this is subject to interception by British warships en route. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington – The American government yesterday instructed Ambassador Steinhardt in the Soviet Union to present a note to the Soviet Russian government regarding the "Flint" ship incident, expressing Washington's displeasure and protest over the Soviet Russian authorities' refusal to release news about the ship and the inability of American diplomatic representatives to contact the ship's sailors. The Russian side reportedly replied that it could not be held responsible for this criticism and that the reason the diplomatic representatives were unable to contact the sailors was because there was no telephone. (Haitong, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington – According to a telegram from U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt today, Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin told him that the American merchant ship "Flint" had already sailed to Germany, and there was no problem whatsoever regarding the safety of the American sailors. The American ambassador asked Potemkin to explain the evidence of its engine malfunction and the reasons for its release. According to the Soviet side, the Soviet Union's actions were completely beyond reproach, as the ship was a captured vessel and should not be kept in a neutral country's port for long according to international law. The American ambassador was very disappointed with the Soviet government's lack of cooperation with the United States. Therefore, the American ambassador requested that the ship and its cargo be returned to the United States, but the Soviet side did not grant the request. However, the lives of the sailors are all very safe. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers Begin Anti-American Propaganda; Foreign Minister Nomura Admits in Cabinet Meeting that Hopes for Improving Japanese-American Relations Are Slim</h3>
<p>Tokyo – On the eve of the upcoming American-Japanese negotiations, Japanese newspapers have adopted a hostile and provocative attitude towards the United States. The holding of the American-Japanese negotiations was initiated by U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew's warning to the Japanese in Tokyo last week. Due to the attitude taken by Japanese newspapers and many officials, these negotiations will begin in a bad atmosphere. It is generally recalled that Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura Kichisaburo admitted to the Japanese cabinet yesterday that hopes for improving Japanese-American relations are slim. He attributed this to the American people's "anti-Japanese attitude." The "Miyako Shimbun's" editorial is the most vehemently anti-American editorial seen in Japanese newspapers in years, but it reflects the attitude of a small number of Japanese newspapers before the start of Japanese-American negotiations. The newspaper stated, "If war breaks out between Japan and the United States, Japan firmly believes that it will win. Therefore, Japan will not yield under American bluffing." The newspaper asserted that no matter what measures the United States takes, including threats of war, Japan does not intend to change its East Asian policy. The newspaper declared, "The United States seems to be mistaken in its belief that it can defeat Japan. If the United States exerts excessive pressure on Japan, only God knows what the serious consequences will be." The "Yomiuri Shimbun" commented this week in the same vein, saying, "Not only the American people, but even the general public in Britain, are arrogant, selfish, dogmatic, and unreflective." The newspaper criticized Grew's speech, saying, "The American's candor is only the result of containing prejudices and distortions. The so-called American public opinion is mostly controlled by Jews, and other people only nod their heads in agreement and are sponsored by the government." Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura Kichisaburo was deeply afraid yesterday that the United States would refuse to accept Japan's explanation of the new situation in East Asia. Therefore, at yesterday's cabinet meeting, he predicted that the United States did not intend to restore the 1911 Japanese-American Treaty, which was recently declared terminated by the United States. His speech clearly contained expectations of a deterioration in Japanese-American relations. On the eve of important Japanese-American negotiations, Minister Nomura stated, "Due to America's firm opposition attitude, it is doubtful that Japan can hope to be accepted by the United States. The government must prepare a plan to guarantee the import of raw materials before the expiration of the Japanese-American Treaty. The expiration of the Japanese-American Treaty will make relations between the two countries more serious." Japanese newspapers stated that preparations for holding Japanese-American negotiations may not be completed until the end of next week. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Foundation Anniversary</h3>
<p>Washington – The U.S. government celebrated the 164th anniversary of the founding of the Navy yesterday. Everything was done in accordance with wartime regulations. Naval yards, warships, and other places that were usually open to the public on Navy Day were not open to visitors yesterday. President Roosevelt sent a congratulatory letter to Acting Secretary of the Navy Edison yesterday, stating, "The most effective way to maintain peace is to defend the coastline. The United States Navy has never failed in its responsibilities in these duties." (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<h3>Germany Reorganizes Administrative Divisions in Occupied Territories, Violating International Law; Poland Protests</h3>
<p>Paris – The Polish Embassy in France recently issued a communique lodging a strong protest against Germany's redivision of administrative regions in the occupied areas of Poland, stating, "Germany's redivision of administrative regions in the occupied areas of our country is yet another act by that country in violation of international law, and should be considered illegal. A warning is hereby issued to the German people who have entered our country. Once the two Allied powers, Britain and France, are victorious, our country will never recognize Germany's occupation of our territory. The people of our country who are forced to leave their homeland at this time will also return to their homeland at that time." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Government Purchases Tungsten Ore from China, Totaling 425 Tons</h3>
<p>Washington – The U.S. government's plan to purchase military supplies and raw materials lacking in the country from abroad was completed yesterday with the first transaction by the Department of the Treasury. The other party was the New York-based China Hua Chang Trading Company. A contract for $427,140 was signed yesterday. 425 tons of Chinese tungsten will be shipped from Hong Kong, Burma, or Indochina to the U.S. Army base in Columbus, Ohio. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington – After the U.S. government decided to purchase 425 tons of tungsten ore, domestic miners and China and Cuba all submitted bids for sale. After comparing the bids submitted by various parties, the U.S. government has now signed a contract with the Chinese side. This ore will be shipped from the interior of the country to the United States via Burma, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. In addition, the U.S. government also wants to purchase a batch of manganese ore. The Soviet government has submitted a bid for sale, but the U.S. government has not yet decided whether to accept it. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Northeast Soybeans Shipped to Germany, Carried by Soviet Railways</h3>
<p>Dalian – Reliable sources here revealed that 1 million tons of soybeans will be shipped to Germany in batches over the next few months. The Soviet authorities have agreed to transport these soybeans via the Siberian Railway. These soybeans can produce 200,000 tons of soybean oil and 800,000 pieces of soybean cake. Soybean cake can be used as feed for dairy cows, and Germany's butter production will also increase. (Haitong, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Well-informed German sources yesterday received news from Dalian stating that the Soviet Union has agreed to use the Soviet railway to transport 1 million tons of soybeans from "Manchukuo" to Germany. They claimed that Germany would be able to solve its food shortage problem as a result. German radio broadcasts stated that the value of goods exchanged between Germany and the Soviet Union would reach 2 billion marks annually. The Soviet Union will provide Germany with millions of tons of kerosene, cotton, minerals, timber, and flax in exchange for German machinery and chemicals. (Haitong, 28th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Conference Postponed to December; Soviet Union Agrees to Send Representatives</h3>
<p>Geneva – According to custom, the League of Nations holds its annual general meeting in early September each year. Due to the European war, it has been postponed to December 4th, to be held at the same time as the regular meeting of the Executive Yuan. Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin of the Soviet Union has recently sent a telegram agreeing to send representatives to the conference. Observers generally believe that the country will definitely send representatives to attend at that time. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Black Sea Fleet Holds Exercises</h3>
<p>Moscow – It was announced here last night that a portion of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet is currently conducting joint exercises with the Soviet Air Force. Most of the naval forces participating in the exercises are torpedo boats, directed from the air by the Air Force. The results of the exercises were extremely satisfactory. (Haitong, 28th)</p>
<h3>Various Parties in Chongqing Express China's Peace Conditions; Japan Must Withdraw Troops Immediately; The Issue of Troop Withdrawal Discussed by the Japanese Army in Shanghai Is Intended to Ease Japanese-American Tensions</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Officials here are quite interested in yesterday's discussion by the Japanese army spokesman in Shanghai at a press conference regarding the mutual withdrawal of troops by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and Japan. Various parties here believe that this expression by the Japanese side is a peace overture to the Chinese side and at the same time wants to make the talks between Nomura and Ambassador Grew easier. According to the Chinese side, firstly, the Japanese side has completely reversed its decision not to have any further contact with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, made twice on November 3rd and December 22nd last year. As for the anti-Japanese movement in China, it was entirely caused by the Japanese, so the Japanese should be responsible for this point. During the time when Zhang Qun was Minister of Foreign Affairs, he discussed the issue of economic cooperation with Kawagoe, the Japanese Ambassador to China at the time, but it had to be based on equality between China and Japan. The Japanese side refused to consider this point, and they still do not want to consider it to this day. Furthermore, there was no anti-Japanese movement in China before the Japanese invasion of China. According to a solemn statement by Chinese officials, even if Japan verbally promises to withdraw its troops, China will never conclude a peace agreement with it if it takes several years to complete its troop withdrawal. Therefore, the most important of China's peace conditions is that the Japanese side must immediately withdraw its troops from the occupied territories. It is also said that the main topic of discussion between Ambassador Grew and Nomura in Tokyo next week will be the China issue. If the China issue is not resolved, it will be difficult to improve American-Japanese relations. As for yesterday's discussion by the Japanese side in Shanghai on the issue of the withdrawal of Japanese troops in China, it was nothing more than to show Ambassador Grew that Japan is prepared to negotiate peace and has no aggressive ambitions towards China, in order to obtain greater results.

<h3>Soong Mei-ling's Original Broadcast Speech to the United States</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, broadcast to the United States on the 26th at the invitation of the New York Herald Tribune Women's Forum Special Edition. Her original speech was as follows: "The New York Herald Tribune Women's Forum Special Edition chose 'Challenging Civilization' as its theme, and broadcasting to your country has filled me with infinite emotion. Japan is the first culprit to strike at all lofty moral principles in our Republic of China. Everything that freedom-loving people around the world commonly worship as sacred, commonly regard as the embodiment of culture, and as the symbol of democracy has been subjected to the destruction of Japanese violence. Eight years ago, Japan, without any reason or going through war declaration procedures, suddenly used troops to invade our Northeast Provinces and implement occupation. They tore up treaties, used the scraps of international law to ignite the flames of barbarism, and challenged democracy with all kinds of threats and murderous weapons. Such acts of violence were met with no expression from democratic countries. At that time, everyone advised us to always listen to the League of Nations and abide by treaties. We respected credibility and therefore took no action. But how much of a response did our trust ultimately receive? What was the result of our waiting? You all know it, so there is no need to say more. However, there was another group of people in the world who acted. Those who dreamed of acquiring power at any cost quickly took advantage of the hesitation of democratic countries. Their invading armies immediately cruelly destroyed the survival and freedom of several nations in the world. Thus, Japan received new encouragement and seized this opportunity to run rampant. Therefore, in various places in Chinese territory outside the Northeast Provinces, the tracks of enemy cavalry were immediately discovered, the sound of Japanese bombs exploding was heard, and all kinds of demonic acts of violence were suffered. These sinful acts of violence by Japan have been inflicted on us for two years and three months. During this period, we rose up to resist without relying on external assistance. We used a weak country to deal with strong violence, but we have after all inflicted serious blows on the enemy. We are now resisting and will continue to resist. In front of us, although there exists not only the guarantee of human morality, but also the Nine-Power Treaty guaranteeing our country's sovereignty and independence, and the signatory countries seem to have completely abandoned their due obligations. This fact, of course, has caused our past trust in Western culture to suffer a violent shaking. But we will still carry out our own sacred mission and continue to resist. When the aggressor Japan has openly challenged civilization, and only we are making a lonely struggle, we feel that democratic countries are really indifferent to the fate of civilization. Who can say that our feelings are excessive? When the United States continues to supply Japan with gasoline, kerosene, and other materials necessary for some aircraft and mechanized units, allowing them to massacre our compatriots and destroy our homes, we know that this American fact of helping the violent will cause our Chinese compatriots to draw what kind of conclusions? However, the recent measures taken by the U.S. government have given us spiritual encouragement and seen a glimmer of hope, knowing that the aggressor's sins will never be abandoned and not punished. We are deeply grateful for this encouragement and this omen. The United States' declaration of the abolition of the treaty with Japan is the first public step among democratic countries to condemn Japan's brutality. Now, the Chinese people all hope that after the United States' condemnation of the aggressor and her consistent rejection of the use of force as an instrument of national policy, there will be continued expressions that will never stop there. If the frank warning given by the U.S. Ambassador to Japan in Tokyo to Japanese leaders last week can be used as a standard for speculation, American action has not stopped there either. For these past years, how earnestly have I been requesting such a frank warning to awaken the deeply deceived Japanese people? What we seek and what we hope from democratic countries is only this matter. Now, the Chinese people only hope that the United States will do one thing, that is, after the United States publishes a statement that it cannot tolerate Japan's destruction of international rights, it will use a solemn and heavy posture to express that it will absolutely no longer help Japan in its work of destroying Chinese lives and property. Simply put, the United States only needs to revoke all conveniences for supplying materials to Japan and cut off the supply of tools that Japan previously used to advance its barbaric massacre, so that this declaration warning Japan can produce practical power and not just be empty words.

<h3>British-Made Cigarettes Gradually Disappear in Jinan</h3>
<p>Beiping – The anti-British movement in Shandong Province is proceeding vigorously, causing British cigarettes to gradually disappear in Jinan. According to Chinese newspapers, the Jinan Anti-British Committee has forcibly ordered the registration of British goods, so stores dare not stock up on British cigarettes. In addition, the source is scarce and the goods are expensive, so those who smoke British cigarettes are becoming increasingly rare. (Reuter, 28th)</p>

<h3>The Netherlands' Strategy for Self-Defense</h3>
<p>— Part One</p>
<p>Special Correspondence from Switzerland: Utilizing Terrain to Construct "Water Line" Fortresses; Land Routes Also Complete Border Defense Construction</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "He who has no foresight will soon find himself in difficulties." Although the Netherlands is small, it is situated amidst the competition of powerful nations and constantly feels the need to be inviolable. In terms of external resistance, it possesses unique and diligent skills.</p>
<p>The Netherlands, known as "Pays-Bas" in French (meaning "Low Countries"), has long recognized the advantage of its low-lying national terrain. It has combined the lands of several provinces to establish an "Water Line" fortress that is difficult to breach, also known as the "Natural Barrier of the Netherlands." The fields and farmlands south of the Zuiderzee and east of the province of Utrecht are all lower than sea level. The Dutch people rely on continuous pumping to keep the land dry. However, if the sluice gates are opened, these farmlands, which are over a kilometer wide, can be submerged in a very short time, forming an "water Line" that prevents the enemy from advancing westward. This effectively separates the interior from the exterior. The provinces west of the "water Line," including Rotterdam, The Hague, and surrounding areas, are protected, resembling a large island in the sea, making them difficult for the enemy to attack. In addition, there is a second "water Line" further east, starting from the eastern corner of the Zuiderzee and extending south to the east of Arnhem. The protected area is even larger than the first water Line to the west. This is the main defense strategy for the heartland's military against external threats.</p>
<p>If we take a step back to consider the Dutch border, apart from the northwest and west facing the sea and the southern border with Belgium, which are not of great concern, the eastern border faces the troublesome Germany. There is a lack of high mountains and large rivers to provide a shield. Furthermore, for the past twenty years, there has been a long period of peace, and the Dutch authorities have relied heavily on the "League of Nations." The border defense forces were not well-equipped, and the limited troops were not necessarily prepared for combat, with training periods being considered too short. Later, they gradually realized that the League of Nations could not be relied upon, and they exhausted their efforts to ensure their own safety. Since 1937, the length of military training periods has been doubled. The European situation changed twice, with Germany occupying Czechoslovakia in September of the previous year and Italy annexing Albania in March of this year. Partial mobilizations were carried out along the border on both occasions, and the mobilized soldiers were later withdrawn. However, since the beginning of the summer of this year, although the Netherlands has not formally mobilized, its border defense forces have been gradually increased and not withdrawn, with plans for a long-term presence. Later, the atmosphere between Germany and the Netherlands became very tense, and the Netherlands formally mobilized on August 28th. The mobilization procedures were fully completed on the eve of the outbreak of war on September 1st. The recruits mobilized this time were reportedly conscripted through quotas, rather than a general mobilization of all young men. In summary, the Netherlands' external defense on the land route, which was considered very weak a year and a half ago, has now been rapidly improved in a short period. There are four noteworthy aspects of border defense construction: First, underground bunkers that are difficult for outsiders to spot are armored concrete fortifications. Every few hundred meters on the ground, there is a bunker underneath, carefully concealed using ingenious methods. Some are disguised as farmhouses, barns, haystacks, and oil depots to confuse observers, while others are scattered along the riverbanks. Second, ground obstacles that are immediately recognizable are set up at major road junctions. These are long, rectangular reinforced concrete pillars that are deeply embedded in the ground, arranged in rows to block the border crossings, all angled outwards. If armored vehicles (tanks) attempt to break through from the outside, they will be trapped and unable to roll forward. In French, they are called "Asperges" (asparagus), as asparagus plants are typically half above ground and half below. These imposing reinforced concrete asparagus pillars are arranged in narrow, winding paths, forcing entering and exiting vehicles to take detours and proceed slowly. Some have openings that only allow one vehicle to pass. If the situation becomes critical, three or four "reinforced concrete asparagus" can be quickly taken from nearby storage, inserted into the holes in the ground, and sealed with cement. The cement hardens quickly, and the opening is immediately blocked. Third, concealed explosives are buried at border crossings and bridgeheads. In the event of unavoidable external resistance, someone in the rear only needs to pull the lever, and the explosives will detonate, completely cutting off ground traffic in an instant. Similarly, the inner layer of the long border pillars is filled with explosives, called "Asperges fard" (stuffed asparagus) in French, which can be detonated by touch, destroying armored vehicles attempting to break through from the outside. Fourth, ditches and marshes that are very unfavorable for blitzkriegs or mobile warfare. Although the Netherlands' eastern border cannot be as heavily fortified as the French Maginot Line, it will not allow foreign troops to advance rapidly across the countryside. Foreign motorcycles and armored vehicles will be forced to follow specific routes, preventing them from breaking through in one fell swoop.</p>
<h3>Severe Disaster in Chongming</h3>
<p>Chongming Correspondence: Chongming is a low-lying coastal area that has always been prone to flooding. Now, with repeated typhoons and continuous heavy rain, the area northeast of the county seat, including Xiejiatun, Shangxiaoshuhe, and the northern coast, is completely submerged. Old dikes and new embankments have been weakened, eroded by the rapid currents, and completely collapsed. Over 13,000 homes have been washed away. Shops in bridge towns and main streets are flooded above the knees, making it impossible to open for business. Not only are soybeans, wheat, rice, and cotton completely lost, but the disaster victims are wailing day and night, starving and awaiting death. Over two hundred families, large and small, of farmers in Ye'etan, northeast of Chenjiatun, have starved to death at the same time, a tragedy too terrible to bear. It is reported that fellow Chongming natives residing in Shanghai are taking measures to provide emergency relief.</p>
<h3>Yichang Emergency, Japanese Troops Busy Kidnapping, Chaotic Situation in Suzhou and Wuxi</h3>
<p>A person from Wuxi reported that since the great victory of the Chinese army in northern Hunan, the guerrillas in the occupied areas along the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Line have been greatly encouraged. Since the National Day, they have frequently threatened the Japanese army, particularly in Yixing and Zhangzhu. The Jinghang (Nanjing-Hangzhou) Highway has been controlled by the Chinese army, which is also in contact with the Chinese army in Hangzhou, seizing opportunities to attack the Japanese army. The news has caused great shock in Changzhou. Many merchants who had placed orders with Shanghai have now stopped their shipments because the situation in Changzhou is very urgent. Since the 26th, the Japanese army in Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places has been busy kidnapping men, causing great unrest in the city and extreme panic among the people. Those kidnapped are being taken to the train station to wait for trains to transport them to Qianxian. Yesterday, many passengers with passes heard the news of the kidnappings at the North Station and immediately turned back,不敢前往. This shows that the Japanese army in the occupied counties is finding it difficult to maintain stability.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships in Dinghai Harassing Zhoushan Islands, Self-Defense Forces Rise Up to Resist, Defeated Japanese Troops Flee Elsewhere</h3>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence: The number of Japanese troops in Dinghai has recently increased again. On the morning of the 11th of this month, two warships were dispatched from Hantougang, carrying over two hundred Japanese soldiers, and sailed to Jintang Island (part of the Zhoushan Islands) outside Zhenhai. They secretly landed. Upon hearing the news, the local anti-Japanese self-defense forces immediately met them and put up resistance. A guerilla war broke out in the Da Xiang Di (a town on the island), Liuxiang, Xiaolixiang, and Gongqian areas. The Japanese army fired intensively with rifles and machine guns, while the self-defense forces responded with rifles and grenades. After several hours, both sides suffered over ten casualties each. The Japanese army, finding the island heavily guarded, returned to their ships in the afternoon. One ship was anchored in the sea near Hengshan Island. The next morning, they secretly landed again in Da'ao (facing the coast, a major town on the island with a dense population) on the same island. Under the cover of machine guns, they searched the Dongyue Temple and Zhapudou areas before retreating to the ships in the evening. On the morning of the 14th, they sailed back to Dinghai, carrying many wounded Japanese soldiers. Late at night, they were sent to the Japanese naval hospital in the city park.</p>
<h3>Chen, Director-General of the Common People's Association, Passes Through Zhejiang, Discusses the Temporary Suspension of Shanghai Affairs</h3>
<p>Correspondence from a Certain Place in Eastern Zhejiang: Chen Haoye, Director-General of the Shanghai Common People's Association, arrived here from Shanghai the other day and attended the celebration meeting for the great victory in Western Zhejiang. In his speech, he elaborated on the relationship between the Common People's Movement and economic warfare, which was greatly appreciated by the provincial authorities and local people. According to Chen, the Common People's Movement is the vanguard of economic resistance. To truly eliminate a life of complacency, every awakened compatriot should start with themselves. The Shanghai Common People's Association originally intended to invigorate the spirit of the people of Shanghai through this movement. However, due to the increasingly unfavorable environment, it has been unable to conduct public activities. Therefore, it has had to temporarily suspend its Shanghai affairs pending reorganization. He is going to Chongqing this time to report on the entire process of the association to the highest authorities.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Suzhou and Changzhou Forcibly Conscripts Civilians into Troops, Over 4,000 Conscripted in Suzhou and Transported to Yueyang, Those Conscripted in Changzhou Were Taken to Jiujiang to Disembark</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: In July of this year, the Japanese army forcibly conscripted four thousand civilians from the urban area of our city. Where they were taken remains unknown, and there has been no news of their fate. It was not until the 21st of this month that a Mr. Wang, who had escaped from Yueyang, reported that after being forcibly conscripted by the Japanese army, they were escorted to the train station and sent to Nanjing, where they were imprisoned in civilian houses near the Ming Palace. At that time, nearly ten thousand people were detained. Then, the Japanese army assigned an old-fashioned rifle and twenty bullets to each person and forced them to train for two weeks. After the training period, they were escorted by a small team of Japanese soldiers onto Japanese ships, which set sail upstream on the morning of August 10th. When they arrived in Jiujiang on the morning of the 11th, the civilians conscripted in Changzhou were escorted ashore. Where they were taken remains unknown. They arrived in Hankou on the 14th and disembarked. Less than three days after disembarking, they were incorporated into the Okumura unit of the Japanese army. However, on the way from Hankou to Yueyang, a large number of people from Suzhou died of illness due to the harsh journey and acclimatization problems. Hundreds died of illness, and nearly half were seriously ill. Even the Japanese soldiers were affected. It was originally planned to go to Miluo to fight, but the Japanese army was largely plagued by illness, so they stayed in Yueyang. He also contracted the disease and took advantage of the relatively lax Japanese management to escape back to Hankou, and then from Hankou to Nanjing and then to Suzhou.</p>

<h3>This Morning's Western League First Division Soccer Match: Tung Wah Plays Laks, 10:30 AM at the Recreation Ground</h3>
<p>In the Western League First Division soccer match, Tung Wah, a strong Chinese team, will play its first match of the season this morning against Laks at 10:30 AM at the Recreation Ground. Since the start of the season, Tung Wah has been victorious in friendly matches, including a 7-4 victory over Laks. However, the absence of key players Yu Qiaoxing and Yang Guisheng, who have returned to Hong Kong, will have a significant impact on their strength. Laks' wingers Fafanxiao and Atig, as well as right midfielder Simmons, are outstanding players (they defeated Saint last week 1-0). The Tung Wah players must be careful. Another match between St. Francis and Portugal will be held at 3:00 PM at the Race Course. In addition, the Chinese team Park Union (Second Division) will compete against the Jewish Association at 3:00 PM at Jiaozhou Park. The lineup is listed below.</p>

<h3>Dongsele Beats West Force 5-3, Upset in First Division Yesterday, North West Boys Beats West Keepers</h3>
<p>In the Western League First Division soccer match, West Force, the champion of the previous season, met Dongsele at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon at the Recreation Ground for an internal clash. In the early friendly matches, the British army defeated the Soviet army 3-1. In yesterday's match, the British army took the lead 3-1 in the first half, but the Soviet army lost 5-3. However, before the end of the first half, the Soviet army's Thompson shot, and Ge Longbo cleared it out of the goal. If this ball had been judged as a goal, the score would have been only one goal apart. In yesterday's match, the British army's right back, Huo Hou, was absent due to illness and was replaced by Pan Te. The Soviet army's right midfielder was replaced by Speis. The rest of the players were the same as those announced. The British army used long passes, while the Soviet army used short passes, each with its own merits. However, the British army was more agile, so it scored three goals after the start of the match. The victory was not accidental. In another match, North West Boys, a surprising team, defeated West Keepers 4-2, which was unexpected. North West Boys also took the lead 3-1 in the first half.</p>

<h3>Today's Friendly Soccer Match, Lido Plays British Navy Joint Team, 3:00 PM at Aurora College on Rue Lupan</h3>
<p>The Lido soccer team, which is free from the Western League Group A competition this week, has specially arranged a friendly match with the British Navy Joint Team, which will take place at 3:00 PM today at the Aurora College soccer field on Rue Lupan. The British Navy team was the champion of Group B last year and could have been promoted to Group A this season, but due to the outbreak of the European war and the uncertain adjustment of the fleet, they voluntarily stayed in Group B. Therefore, their strength is no less than that of the Group A teams. Today, they have gathered the elite of the British fleet stationed in Shanghai to compete against Lido's powerful team. Their wonderful performance is highly anticipated. Lido's strength may be slightly weaker than before due to the fact that key player Wu Qixiang has not yet returned to the team. However, their cooperation with the British army is well-coordinated, which will create many wonderful moments to satisfy the audience's desires. Tickets are priced at five corners, including a donation to refugees. The British army's lineup is composed of the best players from various teams, and it is difficult to select them at this time. It will be possible to determine the lineup today. The Lido lineup is listed below.</p>

<h3>Overview of Educational Development in Chongqing After the Outbreak of the War, All Schools Ordered to Evacuate to the Countryside</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News) Chongqing City, located at the intersection of the Jialing River and the Yangtze River, is a small city with a well-developed education system. Before the war, there were two universities (Sichuan Provincial Chongqing University and Education Institute), twenty-eight middle schools, including five Christian schools, two Catholic schools, eight vocational schools, two provincial normal schools, and the rest were private middle schools. Since the outbreak of the war and the relocation of the national government to the west, the schools have become more developed. A total of eight middle schools and seven colleges above the junior college level have been added, including Central University, Central University Boxi Branch, National Pharmaceutical College, Wenhua Library College, China University, Fudan University, Jinling University, and can be called a forest of schools. Since the Chongqing government strictly ordered the evacuation in February of this year, there are no schools in the city. Most of them are distributed on the south bank of the Yangtze River and the Shapingba area on the north bank of the Jialing River. The Shapingba area is more concentrated, with eight schools including the Sichuan Provincial Education Institute (Independent College), Chongqing University, Women's Vocational School, National Central University, Pharmaceutical College, Central Industrial School, Private Nankai Middle School, and Dagong Vocational School. Student work is also centered here.</p>
<h3>University of London Admitted New Students in China</h3>
<p>In June of this year, the University of London held an open preliminary examination for a Bachelor of Engineering degree. Five people who took the examination in China were admitted: Ajia Funo Fu, Zhu Daohong, Li Xueguo, Huang Yanyuan, and Lu Jixiang. All five of them are students of the high school department of the Leishi and De Institute. According to the clerk of the China Branch of the University of London Examinations Committee, it is already difficult to be admitted to this examination. Now, three students from the school are ranked excellent, which is unprecedented in the UK and around the world, and is rare in all previous examinations. Therefore, in addition to winning the first place in the overall team score, the school also broke all previous records.</p>
<h3>Difficulties and Improvements in Relief and Education for Refugee Children (6)</h3>
<p>— Qian Yonghe</p>
<p>(5) Improving Teacher Quality and Compensation: When Nanjing fell, many primary school teachers suddenly became unemployed. After the Ministry of Education organized teacher registration, elementary schools in various locations increased the number of classes and needed teachers. Orphanages, educational institutions, and charitable nurseries also absorbed many unemployed teachers. However, the aforementioned refugee children's institutions combined education and care. Speaking from teachers' experience, there were many with rich teaching experience, but few with care experience. Moreover, teachers with some ability had already been absorbed by elementary schools, and only reluctantly came to work in refugee children's education and care. While many were driven by volunteerism and enthusiasm, there were also many who were simply waiting for an opportunity. Therefore, the standards for refugee children's education teachers have invisibly declined. Coupled with the intense work and meager pay, it is even more difficult for excellent teachers to stay long. The Nursery Association in Hankou once recruited a group of nursery teachers and provided training, but because there were not many people with strong foundations, few were able to be effective. Recently, another group was recruited in Chongqing, mostly temporarily unemployed men. When other organizations recruit, they go to apply again. In this situation, refugee children's education is truly like a candle in the wind. Therefore, if we want to improve refugee children's education, the first thing we should do is to find ways to train teachers, and at the same time, we should increase compensation to allow excellent teachers to serve with peace of mind.</p>
<p>(6) Emphasizing Hygiene and Medical Work: The most difficult problem in refugee children's education is the large number of sick children. Due to the lack of doctors, nurses, and medicine, the mortality rate of sick children increases. Due to poor facilities and diet, there are even more sick children. Teachers with medical knowledge can only work hard, but the fundamental problems remain difficult to solve. There are even cases of nurses becoming sick from overwork due to the large number of sick children. When doctors arrive at the hospital, they are helpless without medicine. Therefore, the most important thing in refugee children's education is hygiene work. Hygiene work is divided into two types: one is prevention work, and the other is environmental sanitation. Good prevention will naturally reduce the occurrence of diseases, and a clean environment will also reduce the source of diseases. However, each institution often uses limited funding as an excuse, prioritizing saving money, resulting in greater expenses and suffering for the children. For example, during the summer, mosquitoes are the vector for malaria. In order to save money, each institution either purchases mosquito coils or installs gauze on doors and windows, thinking it is sufficient to prevent mosquitoes. The price of mosquito nets can save a lot of money, but in reality, malaria spreads among the children. Quinine is expensive and scarce, and one or two pills per child are not enough. People are scrambling, asking doctors and sending patients to hospitals, and the cost per child has already exceeded the price of mosquito nets. However, mosquito nets can still be used next year, while mosquito coils and quinine are consumed. Even one or two children who were rescued with great effort die. This kind of short-sighted cost-saving is not the principle of economy. Even the physicians and nurses of the Department of Health are not enough to go around. If the hygiene work of each institution is done well, medical work will be easier. If hygiene and medical work are done well, most of the difficulties in refugee children's education can be solved.</p>

<h3>### Finance: Foreign Exchange Rates Continue to Rise; Overseas Funds Return to Shanghai; Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank Secretly Sells</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed prices remain unchanged. In the unofficial market for British and American exchange rates, the overall situation was loose, and selling pressure remained strong, especially from banks. This was due to the situation in Europe, with a large amount of overseas remittances returning home. The newspaper mentioned this several weeks ago. In the first half of the day, the market initially showed signs of a weak British pound and a stable US dollar due to the continued decline in British and American exchange rates. Subsequently, Hong Kong Telecom and speculators sold heavily, and American banks were particularly eager to supply, leading to an increasingly abundant position and an inability to reverse the loosening trend. The British pound weakened to 5 1/1625, and the US dollar strengthened to 8.4375. Although the selling pressure then eased slightly and temporarily stabilized, foreign banks such as Banque Belge suddenly sold heavily, and it was rumored that the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank was also secretly selling, while HSBC's appetite for buying was weak, causing the weakening trend to continue. The British pound's weakest asking price was over 5 1/8125, and the US dollar's strongest asking price was over 8.5625.

<h3>### Securities: US Senate Actions Affect Shanghai Bond Market</h3>
<p>The security market, yesterday's market situation first showed softness and then turned bullish. The market price has been dull for days, lacking any sign of improvement. People's minds are gradually weakening, and there is a sign of imminent collapse. The multilateral barriers are already high, and they must exhaust their remaining strength to engage in a pull. It is also appropriate to Saturday, according to the practice of buying in the afternoon, it is necessary to wait until Monday noon to deliver, and there is a half-day of hesitation in the middle, hoping that the new news will be reported. Therefore, the market price of C and E bonds were raised above nine yuan in the afternoon. The multilateral party, on the one hand, engaged in raising prices, and on the other hand, engaged in shipment through others. This kind of rising wind, if there is no formal news to cultivate it, it is not easy to establish. Yesterday's experience, the morning was extremely calm, and the help entered and exited sparingly. The market price opened and closed at five cents and one jiao between the beginning and the end, so the noon closing market, except for the E bond slightly better than five cents, the rest had no rise and fall. In the afternoon, it was rumored that the United States had passed the Neutrality Act amendment. The multilateral party raised the price to receive it, and the shorts also started to cover. C bond rose above nine yuan, but it was shipped in a blink of an eye. The general followers were exhausted, and the market price became high and low again. The result of the market price was slightly better than three or four jiao. The total number of transactions was about seven or eight hundred thousand yuan. The following is a brief table:</p>
<p>Stock trading成交南洋烟公司股一百五十股, 價為九元三角二分半.</p>

<h3>### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Prices Loosen Daily</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to be weak, and it continues to fall. The environment is bad, foreign exchange rates are loosening day by day, people's hearts are withered, and at the same time, customer needs are shrinking. In South China, the government's control of exchange rates is strict, and the Hong Kong gang's ability is greatly reduced. Therefore, the market's chips are becoming more abundant, and the general grab-hat also makes the move of throwing stones down a well, making it more difficult for the market to recover. Fortunately, although the raw cotton base is weakening, the degree of decline is very slow. The yarn market should be able to support one step.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market still shows a scattered atmosphere at the opening, and actual transactions are very few. The grab-hats, in view of the unfavorable trend and frequent foreign exchange rates, do not dare to move more, so the transaction is very rare. The opening price fell by 14 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Double Horse was 648 yuan. After applying the floating space to resist the entry, the market situation slightly rebounded to close at 651 and a half yuan. It is found that half-day transactions are 880 bales, the market price of 20-count Double Horse fell 10 yuan and 5 jiao, Tiannv fell 12 yuan, and Double Earth fell 16 yuan. Today, there are 21 export cotton yarn shipments to Xiamen, 47 to Hong Kong, 25 to Guangzhou Bay, and 70 to Haikou. The amount of purchases by each gang is listed on the left:</p>
<p>同行　六一〇　海州　四五</p>

<p>香港　一一五　內地　一〇〇</p>
<p>Hong Kong 115, Inland 100</p>

<p>Xiamen 10, Total 880</p>
<h3>Cotton Sales Stagnate</h3>
<p>Cotton transactions have once again entered a state of exhaustion and silence. Yarn prices are loosening daily, and exchange rates are lengthening again and again. People's minds are being hit by this. All factory import tastes are completely blocked, and no transaction has been heard in a single package. In view of the above situation, the flower number parties are feeling uninterested, and transactions have been greatly reduced. Only the industry has imported 350 bales of general flower, with prices ranging from 128 yuan and 5 jiao to 29 yuan. 1,287 bales of general flower arrived in Subei, and 270 bales arrived from North Beach.</p>
<p>Another news report says that the Shanghai outer cotton market is unusually quiet. Yesterday, the exchange rate rose again, and the yarn price fell. The factory side has no intention to purchase, and the industry is also unwilling to sell at a low price. New buying and selling have not started for many days. If the exchange rate continues to lengthen, then outer cotton transactions will be suspended invisibly until a considerable period of time.</p>
<p>Outer cotton market prices, the New York cotton market, initially rose due to telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai. Cloth sales have improved quite a bit recently, so industry transactions are very lively. Recently, the Far East has been relatively quiet, but European transactions are still active. Yesterday's New York cotton closing was very firm, up three or five pounds compared to the previous day. India, including forecasts, rose more than one rupee, Egypt rose more than 20 pounds, and Liverpool rose two or three pence.</p>
<h3>### Grain: Lowered Standards and Demands, Guest Xian Hoards</h3>
<p>Since a foreign firm stopped selling guest xian, its</p>
<p>The sources of Jingwu and other xian are also few and far between, and Jiangbei xian is even more difficult to connect with the market prices in the two places, and has not arrived for a long time. Since japonica rice is expensive, the standards and demands have been lowered, and the sales of pointed xian are brisk. Due to daily sales, the market stock has also been reduced, resulting in a good look in the minds of the general public. Those with goods in hand are holding on to wait for a strategy, quietly watching for good opportunities and selling high. Therefore, at the beginning of the morning market, there was a lack of supply, and those who depended on it felt frustrated, wandering in the market. Those who needed it urgently did not hesitate to search for high prices. At this time, guest merchants raised prices with each other and rushed to sell first, and the situation was tight. The market rose by half a yuan. If Jiangbei Xian opened at 20 yuan and 5 jiao, Wuhu Special Xian opened at 20 yuan and 8 jiao, and the second was Pishan rice at 19 yuan. However, the beautiful scenery is not always there, and it becomes a flash in the pan. After all, the general guests currently believe that if the price is too expensive, the market will have a return if it arrives one day, and there is a risk of loss. They do not want to buy too much, so once they move, they relax, and instead, they stand by. The market situation in the afternoon turned flat again. As for the new japonica market, the supply and demand are similar. The high-quality goods are sold flat due to the high price, and there is not much rise and fall. Changxi Special Japonica is still open at 31 yuan and a half. However, the market goods in the middle city have a stronger absorption intention by the local shops, and the price increases by three or five jiao. Kun Chang Su Tong and other goods are open at 30 yuan and 5 jiao to 27 or 8 yuan. Tea seed kiln seed and Baige rice, due to the lack of high-quality goods in the market, the road is flat, and all adhere to the original market, without honor or disgrace. Wild rice is also open at 31 yuan. Sheep Du Jian was tight with the guest tip at first, but then it relaxed. The closing market was about half a yuan higher than before. Chen goods have been thinned out, and only those in the middle opened at 27 or 8 yuan yesterday. The new yuan's road is also not smooth, and the market lacks changes, opening high goods at 27 yuan and a half, and the second is 26 yuan and a half, and the broken rolling is mediocre. Yesterday, the entire city arrived with only more than 2,000 packages transported by wheels, and a total of 7,000 to 8,000 packages were sold.</p>
<h3>Flour Customer Plate High, Wheat Price Also Dark Tight Has Been</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, although it was the end of the week, customer sales were quite active. Nanyang Gang, Hong Kong, Xiamen, and other places had good demand, and Beiyang Gang's entry was also not lonely. However, the factories used raw materials to rise, and there was no hope of foreign sources. In addition to maintaining the original market of 7 yuan and 3 jiao for retail sales on this street, there were still restrictions on wholesale customer sales, so the customer plate was high. It is said that the price of Paoche flour must be above 7 yuan and 5 jiao, and Tianzhu brand must also be 7 yuan and 4 jiao to 4 jiao and a half, but it is not a formal market. There were 30,000 to 40,000 bags sold in the total market, and most of them were directly distributed. It is said that the factory plate may continue to rise. Today, 3,000 bags are shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's market was still dark and tight. Since the market price has been rising rapidly, the cargo customers are hoarding, and they will not sell unless the price rises. Therefore, both the factory and the hoard side feel lazy in their import taste, and it is difficult for the market to make a strong lift again. As a result, Fuxin and Fufeng jointly organized more than 2,000 packages of Changxi Kuntan and other wheat, and hoarders purchased a total of five vehicles of Wuhu Yangzhou Taipingfu and other wheat, with prices ranging from 11 yuan and 1 jiao to 10 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake: Soybean Oil Still Difficult to Pass Small</h3>
<p>The source problem for the soybean oil market has been brewing for many days. Recently, the basket oil has arrived one after another, and Dalian barrel oil has also arrived at the port, making people feel at ease. The market has fallen, but because a part of the goods arriving are expensive, the sellers are unwilling to let go easily, and they are sticking to the good price. The overall situation is still difficult to see small. In addition to yesterday's market, the small half yuan, a total of ten barrels of Kobe oil were opened, the price was 69 yuan, 220 barrels of Dalian oil, 67 yuan and 5 jiao, 24 barrels of Jiangbei oil, 66 yuan and 5 jiao, 400 pieces of Yanqi oil, 50 yuan, 50 pieces of Qingqi oil, 49 yuan and 2 jiao, 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 48 yuan and 5 jiao, and 100 cans of Baiwen oil, and 20 barrels in barrels. Today, 2,310 bags of soybeans are shipped to Zha Port, and 100 bags are shipped to Xiamen, 2,930 cans and 585 pieces of raw oil are shipped to Zha Port, 390 cans of sesame oil, and 248 bags of sorghum are shipped to Xiamen.</p>

<h3>Mercerized Yarn Soars Again and Again</h3>
<p>Mercerized yarn is very popular in the market due to its beauty, low price, and being manufactured in Shanghai. Western clothing tailors purchase a lot, and Chinese clothing wraps are also cut and used. However, since the outbreak of the European War, dyeing fees have soared, and the selling price has jumped several times one after another. Yesterday, the market price of mercerized yarn rose again. The first grade was sold at 1 yuan and 4 jiao per yard, the second grade was 1 yuan and 1 jiao, the third grade was 9 jiao, and the fourth grade was out of stock and there was no market.</p>

<h3>French Concession: Two Assassinations Yesterday; Li Jinbiao Dies from Two Gunshot Wounds; Wang Fuyan Dies from Three Knife Wounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, two murder cases occurred in the French Concession, one involving Li Jinbiao and the other involving Wang Fuyan, both of whom died. In both cases, the perpetrators fled the scene. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Li Jinbiao</p>
<p>Li Jinbiao, a 55-year-old native of Anhui, resided at No. 3, Zhan Shu Li, Lane 381, Route Lafayette in the French Concession. He formerly served as a member of the detective team of the Songhu Inspection Office. After being dismissed, he had no occupation, but had a large following, reportedly close to three thousand people. After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the National Revolutionary Army withdrew and the so-called "Shanghai Great Way Municipal Government" was established. Li was appointed as an advisor to the "Police Department."</p>
<p>Unable to Avoid</p>
<p>At 11:50 a.m. yesterday, Li was walking home from outside when, as he approached the entrance of Xihu Fang at No. 275 Ximen Road on Route Mareschal Joffre, in front of the Jisheng Tang Chinese pharmacy, a thug suddenly caught up with him from behind and opened fire. Li noticed and was about to run into the Jisheng Tang pharmacy and into Xihu Fang to hide, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Vital Spots Hit</p>
<p>The thug fired several shots, and Li was hit by two bullets. One entered from the back of his head on the right side and pierced through his left temple. The other entered through his spine and did not exit. He fell to the ground injured. Hearing the continuous gunfire, pedestrians panicked and fled. Patrol officers who heard the shots arrived at the scene. The perpetrator had already fled into the crowd in a panic and disappeared. The patrol officers immediately reported to the Louza French Police Station via telephone. A large number of detectives were dispatched and rushed to the scene to apprehend the perpetrator, but they had already fled far away.</p>
<p>Dies from Injuries</p>
<p>An ambulance was summoned and Li was rushed to the Guangci Hospital. Because the injuries were in vital spots, he died before treatment. After examination by a doctor, the body was transported to the autopsy room on Route Tenant de la Tour, and his wife, Mrs. Li Zhang (36 years old, from Suzhou), was notified to report to the First Special District Court to send personnel for examination tomorrow. Thousands of Li's followers received the news and went to the hospital and his home to express their condolences. Meanwhile, the police station dispatched detectives to investigate the cause of death and to apprehend the perpetrator.</p>
<p>Wang Fuyan</p>
<p>Not long after the Li case occurred, another bloody incident occurred on Route de Zikawei. This case involved a knife instead of a gun, and the protagonist was Wang Fuyan, a professor of international public law at the university and a native of Hunan, Wang lived at No. 5, Fuxian Fang, Route Frelupt in the French Concession.</p>
<p>Returning Home at Noon</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Wang had planned to go to school to teach on time, but was temporarily prevented by some business, so he asked the school for a day off and went out to visit friends. At 12:20 p.m., he was returning home from outside, walking slowly.</p>
<p>Violently Stabbed</p>
<p>As he walked to the front of No. 359 Route Tenant de la Tour, a man suddenly followed him, pulled out a knife and stabbed him violently. Wang was caught off guard and stabbed in the back of the neck and twice in the abdomen. He was covered in blood and fell to the ground in extreme pain. The man, seeing this, immediately fled.</p>
<p>Died En Route</p>
<p>Nearby police officers arrived and reported to the police station. A large number of detectives were dispatched to the scene to search pedestrians. Wang was immediately transported to Guangci Hospital, but he died en route due to excessive blood loss.</p>
<p>Daily Life</p>
<p>The body was then transported to the autopsy room on Route Tenant de la Tour, and his wife, Mrs. Di (49 years old, from Tianjin), was notified to report to the court for examination tomorrow. Meanwhile, the police station dispatched detectives to investigate the fugitive perpetrator. Some say that Wang's murder had political motives. Wang was about fifty years old, and his family was the only one living in the house in Fuxian Fang. His daily life was relatively comfortable. The police station has ordered the investigation of the case, and it will not be difficult to uncover the truth.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Panda Shipped to US Via Shanghai: Cost Not High, Shipping Very Expensive; Transported from Chongqing to Hong Kong by Plane</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that the last panda to be shipped out of China is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong this morning (28th) on the President Cleveland, bound for the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago. The panda was purchased in Chengdu by Steel, a Far East correspondent for the Chicago Daily News, from Professor Small of West China Union University.</p>
<p>Purchased in Chengdu</p>
<p>According to Steel, the panda cost little to purchase, but the shipping was very expensive. Scudder is now escorting this rare animal to the United States. The panda was captured in the bamboo forests of Sichuan, but arrangements for its transportation were made before the recent ban on the export of pandas was issued by the central government. It is hoped that the panda is female, as the Chicago Zoo already has a panda named Meimei, who was initially thought to be female but is now known to be male. The English-language China Press reports that the panda was purchased for 100 yuan, is only ten months old, weighs over eighty pounds, and its gender is unknown. It was transported by plane from Chongqing on October 18th.</p>
<p>Transported to Hong Kong</p>
<p>The shipping cost of 1200 yuan was twice the price of a regular passenger fare. According to Scudder, who is escorting the panda to the United States, the animal has been named Li Lin'ai (transliteration), after the Hollywood-based Chinese costume designer.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration recently received an order to recruit Class B postal workers, but has suspended the recruitment of female postal workers, which has aroused opposition from women's circles in this city. In addition to sending a telegram to Director Guo of the Kunming Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications to negotiate, twelve women's organizations, including the Chinese Women's Mutual Aid Association, the Chinese Professional Women's Club, and the Shanghai Women's Association, have decided to invite the local press at 3:00 p.m. today to ask for justice from all sectors.

<h3>Southeast Puppet Armies Operate Independently; Guerrillas Seize Opportunity to Painfully Suppress Them; Puppet Army of Wang Shi and Hupu Surrounded, Japanese Turn a Blind Eye; Over Twenty Japanese Soldiers Killed and Wounded in Battle at Laozha Port</h3>
<p>According to someone who came from Changshu yesterday, the puppet troops of Zhao Peide, Zhao Peizhi, Zhao Peifang, Zhong Bingyan, etc., who are entrenched in the Wangshi, Hupu, Meili, and Fushan areas outside the east gate, are doing all kinds of evil. Recently, these people took advantage of the new grain harvest to force villagers to pay a rent of five yuan per mu of rice paddy, as well as various names such as protection fees, and plundered everything. The New Fourth Army's periphery army, the Changshu Self-Defense Regiment, learned of this and, at dawn on the 27th, gathered the main force from a certain base area and divided into three teams to suppress the puppet troops entrenched in Wangshi Town, Hupu, and other places. Although the puppet troops are panicked, they are still relying on the solid buildings of a pawn shop in the town to resist stubbornly. The battle is still in progress. There are seventy or eighty Japanese soldiers stationed in Hupu. Although they knew that the Self-Defense Regiment was suppressing the puppet troops, they turned a blind eye in order to achieve their goal of using Chinese to control Chinese.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Suffers Losses on Fengxian Border</p>
<p>On the border of Fengxian in southern Shanghai, Chinese and Japanese troops engaged in mobile warfare again the day before yesterday morning. When the situation became tight, ships sailing from Shanghai to Zhagang, Luhui, and Jinhui Bridge were blocked outside the port of Zhagang. They were only allowed to pass after a thorough search. At 4:30 a.m., two motorboats were lowered from a Japanese warship outside Zhagang Port, each carrying over thirty armed Japanese soldiers, and sailed into Laozha Port, hoping to strike the Chinese army by surprise. However, the guerrillas' outposts were stationed directly at Zhagang every night until dawn before returning to the base. At that time, when they discovered motorboats entering Zhagang Port in the darkness, they immediately reported to their base and made emergency preparations. They intercepted the motorboats between Luhui and Zhagang, and a fierce battle broke out. Although the number of soldiers engaged in the battle was small, the sound of machine guns and rifles was as dense as a string of pearls. The fighting lasted for three hours. More than twenty Japanese soldiers were killed and wounded. Later, because the Chinese army was increasing reinforcements, the Japanese feared being heavily surrounded and retreated to Zhagang Port at 8:30 a.m. The Chinese army did not pursue them because it was daytime, and water traffic in the area only resumed near noon.</p>
<p>Train Damaged Near Wuxi</p>
<p>According to a report obtained by foreigners, passengers who arrived in Shanghai on the 27th said that when the Shanghai-Nanjing train arrived at Wuxi station on the 26th, the train suddenly broke down. It is said that this was due to the activity of guerrillas in the area. When the train broke down, they changed trains and returned to Shanghai.</p>

In 1923, the Treaty of Lausanne was signed, and the Allied powers recognized Turkey's independence. A few months later, the Turkish National Assembly was held in Ankara, and on October 29, it formally announced the change to a democratic republic.</p>
<h3>Coal Stockpiles in Shanghai are Sufficient, Prices Have Stabilized, Supply of Firewood and Charcoal is Also Not Lacking</h3>
<p>The price of fuel in Shanghai soared previously due to the impact of the European war and the blockade of the Zhejiang-Wenzhou ports, as well as the manipulation of hoarders, causing hardship for residents. It is now known that foreign coal is arriving in Shanghai in a steady stream, and the stockpiles in the market are estimated to be more than 300,000 tons. Given that Shanghai currently needs 120,000 to 130,000 tons of coal per month, this stockpile alone can supply Shanghai for three months, so coal prices have now stabilized. The price of coal balls has also stabilized due to the drop in the price of coal dust. As for the firewood and charcoal needed in Shanghai, the supply was cut off and the market price soared previously because the transportation to Zhejiang and Wenzhou was blocked. However, the industry has already agreed to cooperate and order goods from places such as Annam and various parts of northern Jiangsu, so there is no need to worry about supply. Therefore, the tense situation of the fuel problem in Shanghai has become a thing of the past.</p>

<h3>British Intelligence Department Representative Arrives in Shanghai to Prepare for Setting Up Eastern Branch Office; This is the First Branch Office Established by the Intelligence Department; Will Correctly Convey the British Point of View</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that Scott, the Far East representative of the British Intelligence Department, came to the Far East from England last month and is currently working to establish branch offices in Tokyo and Shanghai. Its headquarters will be in Hong Kong. Scott told reporters yesterday (27th) that the British government attaches great importance to public opinion in the Far East, so it is establishing the Eastern Branch Office of the British Intelligence Department. The Eastern Branch Office is the only branch office that the Intelligence Department has expanded to outside the British Isles.</p>
<p>Correctly Conveying the British Point of View</p>
<p>Part of the work of the branch office here is to liaise between the various British diplomatic missions and newspapers. The Intelligence Department wants to ensure that the British point of view is correctly conveyed and to compare its own dissemination of information with enemy propaganda. He is currently touring various centers to report on general public opinion to the Intelligence Department and to make recommendations on the agencies he will establish in various countries in the East.</p>
<p>Continuing Concern for the Situation in the Far East</p>
<p>In the first few days of the war, the British naturally focused their attention on the war. However, when he flew from London to Bangkok on September 14, the British public had already become extremely concerned about the Far East. It must be known that Britain is currently using all its resources and energy to wage a war against Germany that may last for several years. London will inevitably view issues related to the Far East and other parts of the world from the perspective of a wartime nation.</p>
<p>Evacuation of Women and Children in London Effective</p>
<p>Scott recalled the evacuation of women, children, and the disabled in London during the first few days of the war, saying that the speed with which the work was completed proved the perfection of the organization, making it difficult for the general public to compare this with a world war. However, wars do not repeat themselves in the same form. This war is completely different from other wars in its beginning and future.</p>
<p>Indiscriminate Bombing Does Not Help the War Situation</p>
<p>When asked why neither the British nor the Germans have yet carried out bombing of cities, Scott replied that bombing is a very dangerous weapon in terms of launching attacks by air, because it will inevitably strengthen the people's will to fight. For example, every time Madrid and Chongqing are subjected to an air raid, the public rush to join the army.</p>
<p>Going to Tokyo Soon, Returning to China Shortly</p>
<p>Scott has served in the British diplomatic service in China for a long time. He first came to China in 1927, served in the consulate, and then served as a secretary at the British Embassy in Beijing. In 1931, he went to Manchuria on a special mission. In 1935, he served as the Trade Commissioner in Hong Kong. In 1936, he served as the Commercial Counselor in Shanghai. In 1937 and last year, he served as an assistant financial advisor in Tokyo and Shanghai. He is scheduled to take a boat to Tokyo on Monday and will return to China shortly before going to Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Request Approval from Settlement Authorities to Set Up Grain Storage; However, Purchases Must Be Made from Production Areas to Avoid Affecting the Rice Market</h3>
<p>The 15th, 36th, and 37th branch associations of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Union believe that expensive food affects the people's food supply and the order of social security. Therefore, they jointly sent a letter to the general association, suggesting that the settlement authorities take advantage of the abundant harvest in the interior and the new grain harvest to transport grain to Shanghai from the production areas, set up public warehouses in the settlements, and implement storage to meet the needs of regulation when necessary. It is now known that the Shanghai Citizens' Union has forwarded the proposal of the branch associations to the French Concession Public Works Bureau and the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday morning, requesting approval for implementation. The association also attached its opinions, saying that if this measure can be implemented, it will be of great benefit to the food supply problem. However, this grain storage must be transported and purchased from production areas, because purchasing in the Shanghai market will stimulate rice prices to rise again and lead to the opposite result. It is hoped that the implementation will be carefully considered to maintain the food supply for the people.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Police to be Held Regularly; Next Month on the Fifth</h3>
<p>The annual inspection and exercise of police personnel in the Public Concession will be held on the morning of the 5th of next month at the racecourse after the first inspection was held last year. More than 1,000 police officers of all ranks, including special police, will participate, under the command of Police Commissioner Ewen and Deputy Police Commissioner Smith. Shanghai Municipal Council Chairman Fessenden and other guests will inspect. The police station will also host a banquet at the racecourse clubhouse to entertain the guests.</p>
<h3>High Tide Returns, Four Days in a Row, Before it Can Subside</h3>
<p>The tide in the Huangpu River was quite high yesterday. The amount of water level was about eleven feet before 1 am, and began to recede at dawn. Again in the afternoon at 2pm, the high tide returned and the amount of water level was about 10 feet and 6 inches. Low-lying roads slightly flooded. This high tide, by the 31st it should subside. During the high tide, the flow of the Huangpu River is extremely rapid. Ferries back and forth should be very careful.</p>
<h3>Establishment of a Health Branch Office on Haining Road: Residents Vaccinated and Injected</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department recently set up a health branch office at No. 130 Haining Road in Hongkou District for the convenience of ordinary people in the Hongkou area to receive smallpox vaccinations and vaccinations. It has dispatched Chinese and Western doctors to provide services since yesterday. Smallpox vaccinations and vaccinations are all free of charge. However, those who want the office to issue the above two certificates must pay 50 cents for each.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Creek North District: British Troops Strengthen Defenses</h3>
<p>Obstacles Reorganized; Japanese Troops Withdraw from Many Positions in Zhabei</p>
<p>Yesterday at approximately 11:00 AM, a unit of Japanese military police (about a dozen men), accompanied by Chinese "auxiliary police," all carrying rifles and wearing yellow wool uniforms with red armbands bearing the white characters "Patrol," patrolled the lanes and alleys of Haining Road North, Jiangxi Road North, Wenjian Shi Road, Tianfu Li, Tongan Li, Dexing Li, Yuanhe Li, and other areas, led by a junior officer. They interrogated and searched anyone deemed suspicious. Residents nearby, unaware of the true situation, felt uneasy.</p>
<p>British Troops Reinforce Positions, Add Barbed Wire</p>
<p>A reporter from Da Guang News Agency inspected the British defense zone along Suzhou Creek yesterday and observed that at the ends of New Garbage Bridge (near the Jiao Hang Warehouse), and at the intersections of Kaifeng Road/Xizang Road and Jielu North/Zhejiang Road, the number of Scottish soldiers at the iron gate posts had been increased to two. The barbed wire obstacles along Xizang Road, Kaifeng Road, Haining Road, Rehe Road, Jielu, and other areas have been reorganized, and additional barbed wire has been installed. At the posts on Jielu North, Henan Road, and the Money Trade Association, only one soldier remained on guard.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Maintain Watch at Only One Location</p>
<p>Since the Japanese occupation of Zhabei, they had built fortifications and stationed armed Japanese soldiers along the concession boundary at Guangfu Road, Menggu Road, Xinjiang Road, Han Bridge, Kulun Road, and other locations. Now, the Japanese soldiers guarding these locations have completely withdrawn. Only Baoshan Road, Haining Road, and Wenjian Shi Road each have two Japanese soldiers guarding their positions, maintaining perimeter defenses. The only remaining observation post is a brick structure behind the Sihang Warehouse, guarded by two armed Japanese soldiers. This indicates that the Japanese troops in Zhabei have been redeployed to reinforce the front lines.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association Re-elects: Shi Zhaoji as President, Heads of Two Concession Health Departments as Vice Presidents</h3>
<p>Following its annual meeting, the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association held its first board meeting and resolved the following: (1) Elected Shi Zhaoji, Zhu Erden, Baluyde, Haishende, Ye Guifu, Madame Chen Kui, Duda, Diao Xinde, and Zhang Jiafu as executive directors. (2) Elected Shi Zhaoji as president, Zhu Erden and Baluyde as vice presidents. (3) Elected Haishende as secretary and Ye Guifu as treasurer (all re-elections). (4) Expand anti-tuberculosis awareness campaigns and promote the work of the Bailinan Road Anti-Tuberculosis Hospital. The association also arranged for Dr. Zhu Gonghong to broadcast on the Gospel Broadcasting Station (wavelength 395.6 meters) from 7:00 PM to 7:30 PM the day before yesterday, with the topic "Why Tuberculosis Patients Should Be Hospitalized."</p>
<h3>Chinese Loyal to Countries Besides China and Britain: Passports Required for Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Vietnamese Residency Permits Reinstated; Transit Passports Limited to One Month</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, the British and French governments have paid close attention to travelers on the important transportation routes to Hong Kong and Hanoi, and have introduced regulations for entry. According to transportation industry sources, the Governor of Hong Kong has recently revised the Chinese immigration ordinance. The issuance of passports to travelers to Vietnam, which had previously been suspended, has been reinstated. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Citizens Now Require Passports to Enter Hong Kong</p>
<p>In the past, Hong Kong authorities did not interfere with the entry and exit of Chinese citizens. However, due to the war, it has become necessary to pay attention to Chinese citizens serving third countries other than China and Britain. The Governor of Hong Kong, acting under Section 2(d) of Article 1 of the 1939 Emergency Powers Act, has promulgated an amendment to Article 7 of Chapter 2 of the 1934 Immigration and Passport Ordinance. The amendment adds the phrase "who are确係 Chinese or British subjects and hold no other nationality" after the words "Chinese people." According to the amended provision, Chinese citizens who are loyal to third countries other than China and Britain will be subject to the restrictions of the law and must obtain passports before entering Hong Kong. Their residency in Hong Kong will also be treated in the same manner as citizens of third countries.</p>
<p>Vietnam Transit: Duration of Stay</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the European war, the French Consulate in Hong Kong temporarily suspended the issuance of all types of passports last month. Transit passports were subsequently reinstated to allow Chinese citizens to travel through Vietnam, but residency permits had not yet been reinstated. It is now reported that the French Consulate in Hong Kong has agreed to requests from various parties and has resumed issuing residency permits, limiting the period of residence in Hanoi and Haiphong to two years. The fee for the permit is HK$7.50. Travelers to Saigon do not need to obtain a passport, but only need to complete vaccination and epidemic prevention procedures before purchasing tickets. The period of validity for transit passports for Chinese citizens returning to China via Annam has been changed from three months to one month, and the fee is one dollar.</p>
<h3>Employees of Industrial and Commercial Organizations Not Exempt from Military Service</h3>
<p>Since Shanghai became an isolated island, employees of trade associations and chambers of commerce, whose families mostly reside in unoccupied hometowns, have occasionally returned home to visit their relatives due to circumstances. Since local authorities in the unoccupied areas were ordered to prohibit the exit of able-bodied men, Shanghai trade associations and chambers of commerce submitted petitions to the relevant authorities, requesting clarification and instructions on whether their employees could be exempted from military service by virtue of their official status. The official reply is that all levels of employees of chambers of commerce and trade associations, except for those in charge, are not exempt from military service according to law.</p>
<h3>Attempts to Control Egg Market Fail: Japanese Merchants Begin Seizing Eggs</h3>
<p>British Consulate Has Lodged Protests Four or Five Times; Replies Received Only State That Investigation Will Be Conducted</p>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reports that eggs purchased by British and American trading firms in the interior have recently been forcibly seized by Mitsui &amp; Co. According to one of these trading firms, Mitsui &amp; Co. attempted to control the market before resorting to seizure. Initially, Mitsui &amp; Co. wanted to join the Shanghai Egg Canning Industry Association. The members requested that Mitsui &amp; Co. first guarantee its sincerity. Mitsui &amp; Co. wanted to</p>
<p>Join First</p>
<p>Mitsui &amp; Co. proposed that they should have first choice of eggs, with the remainder going to the British and American firms. They also wanted to take 15% of the British and American firms' egg trade with Britain. This would have left the British and American firms with only half of their egg exports. When Mitsui &amp; Co. failed to achieve this, they began seizing eggs by force. As a result, the Japanese Consulate-General in Shanghai has received several protests. The British Consulate-General has lodged four or five formal protests. The replies received have only stated that</p>
<p>An Investigation Will Be Conducted</p>
<p>The British side has also reported the matter to the British Embassy in Tokyo. Foreign trading firms purchasing eggs in the interior must obtain a Japanese permit. Each permit must be stamped by the Japanese Egg Association, the Koa Company, and Mitsui &amp; Co. In addition, a tax of two yuan per basket must be paid to the Japanese Egg Association, from which Mitsui &amp; Co. is exempt. The permit system has been in place for two years, and obtaining a permit is not easy.</p>
<p>Mitsui &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Constantly creates difficulties and refuses to stamp permits, sometimes delaying for as long as a month. Mitsui &amp; Co. has been undermining the Open Door Policy for two years, and now they are openly seizing eggs purchased by foreign merchants in the interior when they arrive in Shanghai. The seizure of a truckload of 112 baskets of eggs purchased by British merchants on a public concession road represents the height of their actions. It is reported that the seized truckload of eggs was returned to the British trading firm four days later. However, on the decisive day, another truck belonging to the firm, carrying 30 baskets of eggs, was reportedly stopped and forcibly seized by Mitsui &amp; Co.</p>
<h3>Postal Services Return to Normal</h3>
<p>Due to the strike of postal workers in the postal administration, public works department, import and export departments, and other sections, a large backlog of mail had accumulated. After work resumed at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, efforts were made to actively sort and expedite delivery. As of yesterday, all mail had been cleared. Due to the work stoppage at the parcel dispatch office, domestic and foreign parcel dispatches were extremely congested yesterday. Regarding the issue of equal subsidies for postal workers, the Shanghai Postmaster had forwarded a request to the Kunming Postal Administration on the 18th of this month, and again telegraphed on the 24th to request instructions. However, as the General Post Office is now located far away in Kunming, and the Ministry of Communications is in Chongqing, the relay of requests and replies requires a considerable amount of time. As of yesterday, no reply had been received. It is reported that the bureau has subsequently telegraphed the General Post Office regarding the postal workers' strike. Furthermore, according to a postman from an inland bureau within the Shanghai Postal District, starting in July, the allowance for hardships paid to postal workers and coolies was 7.50 yuan, while the allowance for postmen in inland bureaus was only 2 yuan. The Shanghai Postal Authorities have guaranteed that starting from the September 1st payday, the allowance for postmen will be increased to 10 yuan from October. It is hoped that postmen in inland bureaus will receive the same treatment.</p>

<h3>Japanese Depriving All Countries of Maritime Business in China as of September: Japanese Vessel Numbers Surpass Half of Total, Setting Unprecedented Record in Maritime Industry</h3>
<p>Due to Japanese obstruction, maritime business in China among other countries has declined drastically. After the outbreak of the European War, German vessels have almost ceased operations entirely. As of September, Japanese vessels have accounted for half of all countries' vessels, setting an unprecedented new record. Detailed information as follows:</p>
<p>Maritime Business in China among Other Countries</p>
<p>As of September, the number of vessels from other countries engaging in maritime business in China is: Japan 591 vessels, 1,033,945 tons; Great Britain 152 vessels, 514,942 tons; Norway 56 vessels, 132,808 tons; United States 8 vessels, 71,202 tons; Denmark 16 vessels, 68,344 tons; France 7 vessels, 37,591 tons; Italy 4 vessels, 35,172 tons; Netherlands 15 vessels, 74,819 tons; Sweden 6 vessels, 18,882 tons; Panama 8 vessels, 10,393 tons; Germany 2 vessels, 8,642 tons; Portugal 41 vessels, 4,928 tons; Greece 1 vessel, 1,218 tons; Other countries 2 vessels, 7,566 tons.</p>
<p>Japan Occupies Half Alone</p>
<p>The total number of merchant ships engaged in import and export business as of September is 6,272 vessels, 2,170,937 tons. Of these, Chinese vessels and private ships account for 5,363 vessels, 15,485 tons. Thus the actual tonnage of merchant ships from other countries is 2,155,452 tons. Of this, Japan accounts for 1,033,945 tons, occupying half of maritime business in China among other countries, establishing the highest record in years. In terms of the number of vessels, excluding Chinese vessels and private ships, the total is 909 vessels. Of these, Japan accounts for 591 vessels, surpassing more than half. Maritime business at all ports in North China has been entirely seized by Japan, and other countries are excluded.</p>
<h3>Rapid Development of Southwestern Ports: Beneficial to Economic Development, All Ports Have Trade Surplus</h3>
<p>China’s major trading ports have customs offices dedicated to managing cargo and collecting tariffs. According to reports from local customs offices, Shanghai, Tianjin and Qingdao occupy the most important positions. From the first half of the 26th year to the first half of the 28th year [1937-1939], the value of imported goods from Shanghai, Tianjin and Qingdao totaled 452 million yuan (accounting for 74.45% of the national total) and increased to 580.99 million yuan (accounting for 80.15% of the national total). The value of exported goods decreased from 377.11 million yuan (accounting for 78.08% of the national total) to 257.7 million yuan (accounting for 62.45% of the national total). In the past two years, the total trade deficit from the three ports has increased from 74.88 million yuan to 323.29 million yuan. Southwestern trading ports, on the other hand, have historically had no standing in China’s foreign trade. However, since the War of Resistance, southwestern ports have been reporting trade surpluses. From the first half of the 26th year to the first half of the 28th year [1937-1939], the total trade surplus from southwestern customs offices has increased from 4.05 million yuan to 36.93 million yuan, proving that the foreign trade of southwestern ports is experiencing a new and thriving atmosphere. At this time of resistance and national construction, this rapid development is extremely beneficial to the success of inland economic construction. The trade surplus figures for each port from January to September of this year are recorded as follows: (1) Mengzi: imports 17,592 yuan, exports 31,155 yuan, surplus 13,563 yuan; (2) Beihai: imports 1,422 yuan, exports 14,517 yuan, surplus 13,095 yuan; (3) Tengyue: imports 3,015 yuan, exports 3,104 yuan, surplus 49 yuan; (4) Longzhou: imports 26,215 yuan, exports 33,733 yuan, surplus 7,518 yuan; (5) Simao: imports 329 yuan, exports 368 yuan, surplus 17 yuan; (6) Huanzhou: imports 1,161 yuan, exports 1,390 yuan, surplus 229 yuan; (7) Leizhou: imports 8,664 yuan, exports 12,892 yuan, surplus 4,228 yuan; (8) Wenzhou: imports 2,657 yuan, exports 11,779 yuan, surplus 9,123 yuan; (9) Jiangmen: imports 805 yuan, exports 1,381 yuan, surplus 576 yuan; (10) Kowloon: imports 2,212 yuan, exports 3,875 yuan, surplus 1,6663 yuan. (Unit: thousands of yuan)</p>
<h3>French Concession Police Clean Up Vagrants</h3>
<p>The French Concession police authorities, in order to severely crack down on flower associations, seagoing vessels, and groups of unemployed vagrants who prey on residents within the concession, have been dispatching experienced Chinese and foreign detectives to patrol the streets. Any persons deemed suspicious are searched immediately. In recent days, the number of people arrested each day has been quite substantial. As a result, groups of hooligans now dare not extort money from others. Furthermore, those who lie under the overhanging structures in the lanes and alleys and smoke opium (drugs) are also being searched, arrested, and evicted by detectives late at night.</p>
<h3>Hat Factory Owner Embezzles Payment</h3>
<p>Xin Zengkang, a native of Ningbo and the 24-year-old owner of the Xin Zengkang Hat Factory located at Room 541, Changsha Trading Company, Diandang Street, French Concession, has recently been gambling in various casinos in western Shanghai. Due to his heavy losses and inability to compensate, on August 22nd, 26th, and 29th, he purchased large quantities of camel wool from Jinglun Camel Factory at No. 4 Fululi, Laozhao Road, Public Concession, Lisheng Wool Company at No. 10 Defengli, Beijing Road, and Dawei Camel Wool Factory in Zhang Chongxin Lane, Ningbo Road, paying a small amount of the purchase price and taking the goods back, promising to pay the remainder on schedule. He then pawned the goods at Yongli and Yuanshun pawnshops to obtain funds for gambling. When the due date arrived, the suppliers were unable to obtain payment and discovered that the goods had been pawned. Suspecting fraud, they reported the matter to the French Concession police, who arrested him and handed him over to the Special Second Court for interrogation and detention for further investigation. Yesterday, Judge Wu Kechou opened a court session for further examination. The police lawyer prosecuted him for continuous fraud. The plaintiffs stated that the defendant's family had paid off the debt and requested leniency. During interrogation, the defendant admitted that he purchased the goods in advance because the price of goods was rising, promising to pay the purchase price gradually, and hired a lawyer to defend him. After reviewing the evidence, the court sentenced Xin Zhirong to four months imprisonment for fraud, suspended for one year.</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Owner Kidnapped and Murdered: Key Witness Unable to Appear Due to Injury</h3>
<p>Xue Wenlong, also known as Xue A’ren, a native of Wuxi, who owned the Qialun Silk Filature in Hudieqiao, Wuxi, was kidnapped on March 25th of this year by Hou Genxiang, a local bandit, and more than 20 of his accomplices. He was shot to death after failing to pay the extortion money. Afterwards, Hou fled to Shanghai and hid in the Liangxi Hotel on Hubei Road. Hou was coincidentally spotted by Dai, who reported him to the police. He was arrested and handed over to the First Special Court for trial and detention. After the Supreme Court designated the First Special Court to handle the case, Judge Feng Shide had once opened a court session to interrogate him, but the defendant's testimony was vague, and the court ordered him to be returned to custody, pending the appearance of Liu Jisheng, a witness who witnessed the shooting of Xue Wenlong, for further interrogation. This morning, further examination was conducted, but the witness Liu Jisheng was absent due to illness. Xue Dai submitted a statement stating that the witness Liu Jisheng was defrauded by a criminal while obtaining a travel permit, and was severely injured by a police officer on the train. He is currently in the hospital recuperating, and according to the doctor, he will not be discharged for two weeks. After reviewing the statement, the court ordered that the case be postponed for another fourteen days.</p>
<h3>Xin'anna Ship Reports Being Stopped and Anchored at Wuxingbei: Now Plans to Continue Attempts to Sail Directly to Wenzhou; Resumption of Shanghai-Wenzhou Voyage Encounters Further Obstacles</h3>
<p>The Xin'anna ship, an agent of the American Weili Han Shipping Company, loaded cargo in Shanghai and attempted to sail to Wenzhou the day before yesterday. Four days have passed since. Because this ship is the first to attempt the Shanghai-Wenzhou voyage after the Oujiang River was blockaded by the Japanese, the voyage's progress has been of concern to various circles. It has recently been learned from shipping industry sources that the ship set sail from Shanghai on the 25th and arrived off the mouth of the Oujiang River on the evening of the following day. Due to being blocked by Japanese warships, it temporarily anchored at Wuxingbei outside the mouth of the river. According to a telegram to Shanghai, it planned to enter the port last night and sail directly to Wenzhou. However, no telegram reporting the ship's safe arrival in Wenzhou has been received as of yesterday. Almost a month has passed since the Shanghai-Wenzhou route was cut off. At present, there is a large backlog of local goods in Wenzhou waiting to be shipped out. It is also reported that the ship had entered the Oujiang River yesterday morning. The date of its return to Shanghai has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Jiuru Money Exchange Robbery: Five Gang Members Arrested, Over 20,000 Yuan in Stolen Goods Recovered, Mastermind and Others Fled into the Chinese Area</h3>
<p>On the 12th of this month, at 8:15 PM, the Jiuru Money Exchange at No. 84 Xihua Road was broken into by a large group of robbers. They used guns to frighten the employees and ordered them not to make a sound, and tied them up with hemp ropes. They then robbed a vault hidden under the floor of the shop, taking currency and gold of an estimated value of 135,846.90 yuan, including French francs, British gold, US dollars, Japanese yen notes, as well as the employees’ gold watches, gold rings, and other valuables. They then fled separately without a trace. The money exchange reported the incident to the Huishan Concession Police. Chinese and foreign detectives received a tip</p>
<p>From a Confidential Informant</p>
<p>And arrested the suspects, Chen Youqi and Huang Wuxiang (Yu A’gen, who previously worked as a chauffeur for the money exchange) of Haimen, and Cai Qilang and Chen Bairong of Chongming at Kangnaot Road, Jiaozhou Road, and the Xianshi Garden Rooftop Garden on Nanjing Road,</p>
<p>Recovered Stolen Goods</p>
<p>Including 143 pounds of British gold, 185 US dollars, 10,000 Japanese yen notes, and 1,219.48 yuan of national currency (totaling 24,274.45 yuan), along with a woman named Wang Yumei of Haimen, suspected of being an accomplice, in a bungalow in the Jiangjia Temple area of Xiaoshadu Road and No. 25 Yuqingli, Xiamen Road. All were taken to the police station and handed over to the First Special District Court for detention. Because the gang leader and eight other accomplices were still at large, reporters were instructed not to publish the details.</p>
<p>Arrest Fugitives</p>
<p>The defendants were returned to custody and the date was changed. Chinese detective Zhang Yunsheng, Huang Fusen, Qi Mengqing, and Detective Chief Zhou Guisen, who were in charge of the case, learned that the fugitive robbers and stolen goods were all in a certain district of the Chinese area, and were unable to make arrests. Therefore, the police handed over the six male and female suspects, including Chen Youqi, to the Third Criminal Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, gave a detailed account of</p>
<p>The Case's Discovery</p>
<p>And stated that the woman, Wang Yumei, had been found to be innocent and should be released from custody. Judge Jiang Shuzi approved this. Chinese and foreign detectives then clarified the circumstances of the arrest of each defendant. The stolen goods were presented for inspection. The Jiuru Money Exchange's representative, manager and employee, testified to the robbery situation at the time. Upon questioning, the defendants confessed that they had been invited to rob by the fugitive leader, Chen Xilang. Judge Jiang ordered that they be returned to custody and the date be changed for further verification.</p>
<h3>Negligent Driving Causes Severe Collision with Utility Pole; Two Military Personnel Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, two military personnel were driving a car, license number 8909, speeding west along Avenue Edward VII when they approached the intersection with Rue Cardinal Mercier near the Eight Immortals Bridge. There, a Route 10 tram traveling from Lokawei turned toward the station. The car attempted to swerve to avoid a collision but, in its haste, crashed into the utility pole on the station platform with a thunderous crash. The car’s front bumper, windows, and lights were all destroyed. Both the driver and his passenger suffered serious injuries, and the station guard called for an ambulance to transport them to a hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Russian Child Steals Mother's Fortune, Implicating Those Greedy for Petty Gains; Robbery Trial Concludes, Verdict Pending</h3>
<p>On the morning of January 22nd, a ten-year-old Russian boy named Vakdor, residing at No. 6, Alley 22, Rue Corneille, surreptitiously stole over 7,000 yuan in legal tender (ten yuan per bill) from a cloth bag hidden under his mother's pillow. He then went outside with his friend Sadulov (twelve years old) to a vacant lot at 225 Route Mgr. Froc, where they began distributing the money as if playing a game. Jiangbei residents Li Yongjin, Shi Baoxiang, and Shi Zhang's mother and son happened to pass by, caught sight of the scene, and rushed forward to snatch some of the money. The incident was discovered by the French Concession police, who dispatched detectives to apprehend the three men and women involved in the robbery, recovering over seventy yuan in banknotes. Simultaneously, over 5,000 yuan were found on the two Russian children. They were handed over to the Second Special District Court for personal custody. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liao presided over a continued hearing in the First Criminal Court. The police formally charged the defendants with robbery. All defendants insisted that they had found the money on the vacant lot and had not snatched it from the children's hands. The court verified the statements, deliberated, and concluded the trial. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 31st.</p>

<h3>Implementing a Policy of Opium Poisoning, Establishing a "Bureau of Opium Suppression," Expanding the Monopoly and Squeezing Taxes</h3>
<p>Da Guang News Agency reports that the Japanese, in order to implement a policy of poisoning the people, have openly permitted the sale of narcotics in various occupied areas. According to reliable sources obtained by a Da Guang News Agency reporter, the Japanese recently, to expand their opium poisoning plot and to extract taxes to alleviate their economic panic, have instigated the puppet regime to organize a so-called "Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Opium Suppression." It is said that they have appointed Sun Jiefu (nicknamed "Iron Arm" Jiefu, a notorious gangster in Hongkou), the former "Guard Captain of the Reformed Government" as "Director." He has already dispatched his henchmen to occupy a private residence of the Zhu family on Feihong Road in Hongkou, intending to set up the "Bureau" headquarters and discuss public sales methods.</p>
<h3>Lost Ladies' Watch</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday (October 27th), I took the Route 14 bus from the Bund to Yidingpan Road. At around 5:35 PM that afternoon, as the bus approached Avenue Foch and Route Haig, a well-dressed passenger sitting in the front row found a ladies' rectangular watch with a leather strap on the floor. He looked at it for a long time, not knowing what to do. I told him to hand it over to ticket seller number 454. I saw him hand it over, and then I wrote down the ticket seller's number, location, time, and bus number (76). Anyone who has lost it should inquire with the China General Omnibus Company, and it should be returned to its rightful owner. (Respectfully, Pan Zhiben, 169 Yuanmingyuan Road)</p>

<h3>Mainland China Bans Imports of Shanghai Goods, Inspection Difficulties for Products Containing Foreign Raw Materials, Concerns About the War of Resistance Economy</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs, to increase wartime production, has conducted thorough research with relevant agencies on the export of non-restricted local products and the import of completely domestic goods, and has formulated measures. The above-mentioned work has now been completed and submitted to the Military Affairs Commission. The import of domestic goods produced in occupied areas is strictly prohibited throughout mainland China. However, some items produced by Chinese merchants in Shanghai are still permitted for import. Recently, it has been found that although the products of Shanghai Chinese merchants are nominally domestic goods, their substance is not entirely so. Some merchants even use foreign goods in place of originally domestic raw materials, and inspection is extremely difficult. If these non-genuine, completely domestic goods are allowed to be sold in mainland China, it will actually prolong the strength of the invasion. Therefore, their import should be absolutely prohibited to achieve perfection. From now on, except for unfinished goods that are clearly identified as domestic goods after inspection and permitted for import, the import of all manufactured goods will be prohibited. The ministry has already telegraphed this to the provinces, and the Ministry of Finance has instructed all customs offices to comply.</p>

<h3>Without Climbing High Mountains, How Can One Know the Plain</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>I am using this idiom as the title to express some opinions to children. This idiom is almost a maxim, extremely simple and easy to understand, and children will definitely understand it. However, its meaning is somewhat profound and cannot be fully interpreted literally, otherwise I would be too mediocre. Everyone knows that high mountains are very steep, and climbing them is not easy. Without experiencing steep and rugged mountain roads, one will never be satisfied with the stability and safety of the plains. Now, let's try to expand on this meaning.</p>
<p>For example, when I was a student, as soon as I entered the dining hall, I would make things difficult for the cooks, criticizing the rice for being too coarse, the side dishes for being too poor, the vegetables for being too old, the fish for being bland, and the shredded pork for having too much fat. It was as if the cooks were deliberately mistreating us, and they had to be punished immediately. Later, after leaving school and serving in society, the food provided became even more meager. Being at the same table as superiors was far less free than in the school dining hall. I only wanted to fill my stomach to get to work, and I had neither the time nor the convenience to criticize the taste of the food. At one point, I even developed stomach problems, and I realized that my criticism of the cooks during my student days was an unwarranted demand.</p>
<p>If I hadn't experienced social life, I would never have felt the comfort of school life. This is an example of "Without climbing high mountains, how can one know the plain."</p>
<p>I once saw a child dissatisfied with the canvas sneakers on his feet. He asked his mother to buy him a pair of leather shoes. Naturally, shiny leather shoes are much more beautiful and attractive than canvas shoes. But the mother refused because leather shoes were expensive. The child got angry, cried, and threatened to not go to school as a form of resistance. What was the result? I don't know. I only regretted that there was no opportunity to take that child to the countryside to see what the children there wore on their feet. Six or seven out of ten were barefoot. Having shoes without socks was already considered quite comfortable. But the so-called shoes were either covered in patches or had uppers but no soles. Some even dragged along their parents' old shoes to school. If they could be given a pair of canvas sneakers, they would be incredibly happy!</p>
<p>I also personally saw a child from the countryside secretly wear new cloth shoes meant for the New Year, and was beaten by his parents. I really feel that children growing up in the city are too fortunate and too comfortable. So why are they still dissatisfied with food and clothing? It's simply because they only walk on the plains and have never climbed high mountains. However, children only need to see the children in refugee camps, orphanages, and shantytowns, and they will be content.</p>
<h3>Don't Stop Moving</h3>
<p>— Polingshansi</p>
<p>On a very old key in Germany are engraved these two proverbs: "If I stop moving, I will rust." - What interesting and cautionary words!</p>
<p>The famous British Prime Minister Gladstone said: "Look, nature is never-ending. Even our heart, although it is still beating when we are asleep, will stop for a moment, then death will follow."</p>
<p>Tao Kan, a famous minister of the Jin Dynasty in China, when he was working in Guangdong, had to move two stacks of bricks back and forth every day. The so-called "transporting bricks to practice diligence" is this. Also, Gladstone, who was mentioned earlier, would chop firewood for an hour after lunch every day. It was not that they intended to be masons or stokers, but to exercise their bodies and avoid becoming accustomed to comfort, so that they would not be able to shoulder important responsibilities in the future. Peter the Great, the world-renowned Tsar of Russia, when he was still a prince, took a dissatisfied and restless attitude, running to shipyards, paper mills, sawmills, and other factories abroad to work - as an apprentice. He not only paid attention to observation, but also worked seriously, receiving the same treatment as ordinary workers. How can such a spirit not be respected?</p>
<p>Malton said: "Work and exercise are the most appropriate medicines for treating weakness. Living in idleness, pain can arise at any time and anywhere. All baseness and evil occur in leisure time." He also said: "When a thing is done to a certain stage, it must not be stopped and considered satisfactory, but should continue to strive to reach a higher step. When one is satisfied with oneself and no longer seeks progress, it is the beginning of the destruction of his career."</p>
<p>Children who have made the mistake of "stopping moving" because of greed for comfort or complacency with everything themselves, what do you feel after reading everything written above?</p>
<h3>New Year's Day Hike</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>The Fortieth of the Ming'er's Escape Diary</p>
<p>When the last sheet of the torn-off calendar was reached, and another brand new and thick one was replaced, and the red-printed first sheet was discovered, it was clear that the New Year had arrived. Whether in peaceful times or in chaotic times, it always arrives unconsciously, once a year, but in the eyes of intelligent people, there are infinite feelings about it.</p>
<p>Ming'er was driven by the terrifying god of war to a foreign land thousands of miles away. Having such a beautiful and lovely hometown but unable to live in peace, wandering far away, therefore the arrival of the New Year is very indifferent in the hearts of the refugees. What interest is there? And it does not attract their attention to the poor and remote villages, because they are celebrating the lunar New Year, regardless of what national calendar. After all, old customs are not easy to abolish.</p>
<p>However, the New Year still goes its own way, regardless of whether people welcome it or not. Finally, the people in the village were still doing the work they should do every day, without any movement. However, it aroused a reaction in Ming'er's mind: "In previous years, I always liked the New Year very much. There were holidays at school, celebrations, fun games, delicious candies..." This burst of fantasy was like a colorful picture reflected in his mind, with a sweet aftertaste. "Now I am living a refugee life in a cold and clear home, without reading books..." It was another burst of annoyance and a sour taste of longing. This New Year made Ming'er lose interest. Not only him, but the whole family was silently dragging this day past, and his mother was also listlessly forced to do the work of washing and cooking.</p>
<p>"Today is the beginning of the year, let's go for a walk in the mountains to add some embellishment!" said the father. Of course, everyone agreed without dissent. So they stepped onto the mountain path.</p>
<p>After walking for about half an hour, Ming'er's father was old after all, stopped and sat down on a stone by the road to rest. The place was already dozens of feet above the ground, and the village over there had sunk down. The boundless earth, the plots of fields divided into such neat squares, were pieced together one block at a time, embedded in the ground. The fields were inlaid with verdant vegetables, and the dikes were adorned with withered yellow grass. The green was emerald green, and the yellow was goose yellow, each reflecting the other in an extraordinarily dazzling way. The misty distant mountains, the azure blue sky, the dots of white clouds, and the clouds of clouds, this is a beautiful picture of nature. The towering peaks stood in front of him, making him feel even more insignificant. It was truly a grain of millet in the vast sea. At this time, Ming'er's depressed heart was relieved. Occasionally, one or two sounds of chicken crowing came from the distant village, and listening to it in the silent wilderness around, the harmony of the sound and the beat of the rhythm were simply as pleasant as playing music. In short, the beauty of this great nature is impossible to describe even one ten thousandth of it. One must be there to feel the endless fun.</p>
<p>After resting for a while, they continued to walk forward, and had already reached the foot of the high mountain. Ming'er became even more courageous and stepped onto the mountain road. The road was certainly more rugged and steep. Walking up required leaning over and using force in the feet to step up. However, the more difficult the road was, the more steep it was, the more it aroused their interest. Strive! Strive! Run up the mountain! The withered grass on the mountain grew long and often caught their clothes, suggesting that they should not run up. But the more they were hindered, the more they ran up. After all, human strength was limited, and they stopped halfway up the mountain. Although they had sweated a lot and used a lot of energy, looking back, it was a new scene. At that time, the setting sun was about to set, and the golden light dyed the high mountain into a golden color, rich, magnificent, radiant and radiant. This was the gift of nature to their New Year, and also the result of their efforts, and it encouraged them not to be decadent, not to be negative, but to be brave! Insist on the last moment and second! Then the final victory will definitely come, and it will be as bright as the golden mountain! Just as beautiful!</p>
<p>Correction: In last week's "What Does the Earth Look Like" column, line 11, "airplane" was a mistake for "moth".</p>
<h3>The Nanny and the Wolf</h3>
<p>— Avianus's Fable —</p>
<p>Very eager to eat dinner, running around everywhere. It passed by a door and heard a child crying, and a nanny was scolding him, "Don't be naughty again, if you're naughty again, I'll feed you to the wolf!" The wolf heard this and waited for a good opportunity, hoping that the nanny would do what she said. But the child was not sent. The wolf turned around and had to leave.</p>
<p>It went to this family again in the evening, and it heard the nanny change her tone, comforting the child, "Dear baby! Good baby! If the wolf comes, we'll smash its brains out." The wolf heard this and had to leave. As it walked, it muttered, "People are really incomprehensible! What they say is one thing, but what they mean is another thing!" (Translated by Zhao Yilin)</p>
<p>Prevention is Better than Cure Jing Yu</p>
<h3>Blue Dwarfs (6)</h3>
<p>— Ai Li</p>
<p>At that time, the uncle and aunt and Ali went to the highlands first. After Ali waited for them to go far and could no longer be seen, they prepared everything and began to implement Yi's planned plan.</p>
<p>Ali muttered to himself, "I may encounter those dwarfs, so it is better to bring a purse. Aunt once said that we should be polite to the dwarfs, and they would like the small silver and copper coins, which match their small bodies well." So Yi pitied a few of the smallest copper and silver coins and put them in a purse, and also brought a piece of bread to fill his stomach, and put an umbrella and a book in the small basket, and Yi set off happily.</p>
<p>Although there was a good shade of trees in the forest, the residual heat of the day had not dissipated, and it was still hot and hot. Yi first walked a distance, and was very excited, so it became more and more distant, and it was clear that it had penetrated into the center of the forest. Because Yi was walking alone for the first time, it had no experience, so it just rushed forward and did not pay attention to the landmarks along the way, and of course it did not think about the way back. Yi saw those winding paths, one after another to tempt Yi, Yi thought there was a lot of mystery in this, maybe it could lead to where the dwarfs lived, Yi walked in without hesitation. On the trees on both sides, there are often squirrels jumping around there, but when Yi looked up, they were long gone. And those strange wild birds, when they saw a stranger coming, made one or two strange calls, which made Yi stop with fear. In the thick moss, beautiful and lovely wildflowers often grow, and from time to time he heard the crisp and pleasant sound of the stream nearby, but he did not know where it was. Dao Si's surrounding scenery is really extremely beautiful, and Yi's heart would be very satisfied if it was not occupied by the blue dwarf, then he would be very satisfied to see these beautiful scenery.</p>
<p>Ali hurried on the road for a while, and did not stop. At the end, Yi felt tired, so he said to himself: "I should sit down and rest for a while. Even if I want to rush back, I have to go a long way. This seems to be in the middle of the forest. If the dwarves really live in the forest, then they may come here to wander." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Remembering Wang Yaoqing, Who Is About to Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Zhibai</p>
<p>It is said that the old actor Wang Yaoqing has agreed to come south to Shanghai with his disciple Wang Yurong. Yaoqing's trip is not to perform in Shanghai, but just to travel south. Whether the people of Shanghai will have the chance to see him acting is still a question.</p>
<p>Wang Yaoqing is the son of the famous Dan actor Wang Cailin. He studied Qingyi privately with Hu Xilu. Not only is he knowledgeable about drama, but he is also dedicated to the innovation of old dramas. Yaoqing is the first person to invent new tunes and improve costumes. Wang Yaoqing also pioneered the practice of Daomadan wearing boots and the wearing of Fu Zi helmets. He is even more skilled in arranging scripts. When he was in the Fusheng class, he performed dramas such as "Powdered Makeup Tower", "De Zhengfang", "Five-Colored Sedan Chair", "Romance of Heroes and Heroines", and the eight-volume "Yanmenguan", which were famous for a while. Yaoqing entered the Tongqing class and cooperated with Tan Xinpei for a long time. Lao Tan performed dramas such as "Visiting Mother", "South Tianmen", "Fenhe Bay", "Five Families Slope", "Beating the Fishing Killing Home", "Trial of the Head and Assassin Tang", and "Beaded Curtain Village", all of which were accompanied by Yaoqing. To this day, Yaoqing and Lao Tan perform the two dramas of "Fenhe Bay" and "Five Families Slope" with seamless perfection.</p>
<p>Yaoqing's art is most refined in Daomadan. Today, Zhao Tongshan (Furong Cao), who specializes in performing Daomadan, is his disciple. In addition, because Yaoqing has been in the inner court for a long time, performing Qing clothing dramas is also a must. Yaoqing's Qing clothing dramas can be based on the dressing of the palace and palace, learning the way people in the palace walk, lifelike. Therefore, his Qing clothing drama's stage steps can be wonderful. Tongshan's Qing clothing stage steps can be well-reputed, half also get Yaoqing's guidance</p>
<p>Yaoqing has been out of the singing world for more than ten years. During the 15th and 16th years of the Republic of China, when Cheng Yanqiu organized the Minghe Society and performed at the Huarue Garden in Xianyuokou, the old capital, Cheng Shorong Diexian was also affiliated with the Minghe Society. Later, he had opinions with Yanqiu and left the Minghe Society. Cheng then consulted Yaoqing to join in cooperation. After Yaoqing joined the Minghe Society, he arranged two dramas, the eight-volume "Fushou Mirror" and the eight-volume "Yanmenguan", for Yanqiu, which caused a sensation. In his later years, Yaoqing's voice was already hoarse and out of tune, but he still performed the Xiao Empress in "Yanmenguan" with Yanqiu with great brilliance. He was as successful as Mei Qiaoling Chen Delin. This is because Yaoqing has real skills. In his later years, he enjoyed teaching disciples. The number of students under his door is countless. To this day, Kunling, who is rising up, all come from Wang's family. Wang Yurong, who was hired to come to Shanghai this time, is his most proud female disciple, so he resolutely accompanied her.</p>
<h3>A Record of Watching a Play at the Carlton</h3>
<p>— Barking Sound</p>
<p>This year, the Carlton Grand Theatre, because the first part of "Wen Su Chen" exceeded the previous record for new plays in ticket sales, it then continuously staged the second and third parts. During this period, daytime performances included "Heavenly Rain Flower," "Dragon and Phoenix Silk Scarf," and other old plays, causing theatre enthusiasts who love classic plays to regret not being able to see Kylin School masterpieces. Fortunately, Heaven answered their prayers. Recently, due to the fourth part of "Wen Su Chen" not being ready in terms of colored scenery and costumes, it was decided to temporarily perform classic old plays as a transition. As a result, those with a fondness for Zhou Yu were all beaming with excitement, eagerly anticipating the performance. I was invited by a friend to see Xin Fang's "Southern Heavenly Gate" and "Phoenix Mountain." Last night (the 26th), Xin Fang performed "Ulong Court." Because Xu Muyun of this newspaper had insightful views on the gold and silver issues in "Ulong Court" recently, and my friends had different opinions, I decided to go and see it to find out the truth. When I entered the theatre, "Reed Flower Marsh" was being performed, with Yu Zongying playing Zhou Yu. His performance was quite steady and skilled. After Zhou Yu's death, it was immediately followed by the "Nao Yuan" scene. Su Wen played Xi Jiao, using improved stilts, and her dialogue was clear and lively, perfectly fitting the identity of Granny Xi. Gao Baisui played Song Jiang. The line "After the old man beat the retreat drum, Song Jiang came to the front of the yamen" seemed to need some consideration. Beating the retreat drum is the job of the yamen runners and clerks, how could a "great master" do it himself? Also, "missed finding the landlord," I wonder, since Ulong Court was built by Song Jiang himself, where would he go to find a landlord? Although this is a minor detail, it should be noted.</p>
<p>Xin Fang then performed "Writing a Letter" and "Stabbing the Daughter-in-Law," with Lu Lingyun playing Liu Tang. He was quite competent, but it was a pity that the "red" in "Red-Haired Devil" was pronounced as "chi" [different tone], which was a minor flaw. Xin Fang's Song Jiang, when Liu Tang asked, "Do you still recognize me, little brother?" kept being vague, which was a brilliant idea. If he admitted to knowing him, the name of the person would be difficult to remember for a moment. But if he said he didn't know him at all, since he was known as Timely Rain or Huyanbao, it seemed inappropriate to directly say he didn't recognize him. This scene can be said to be Xin Fang's best performance, so the audience below all held their breath and praised it as the ultimate performance. The performances of "Reading the Letter in the Wine Shop" and "Receiving Gold" were truly masterful and natural. When killing the daughter-in-law, Wang Xichun played Xi Ji, also using improved stilts. A few lines of dialogue with Song Jiang were extremely crisp and sharp, no wonder the Yifeng Society relied on her so heavily. At this point, I had other matters to attend to, and unfortunately missed the chance to see the long-awaited "Chopping Scripture Hall," which was a real regret.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Private Performance at the You Mansion</h3>
<p>— Being There</p>
<p>You Boqun, Assistant Manager of the Trust Department of the Shanghai Bank, celebrated his father's sixtieth birthday yesterday. Mr. You has extensive social connections and is a great lover of Peking Opera, as well as the chairman of the bank's Peking Opera Club. In advance, the club members initiated the preparation for a private stage performance. On that day, a banquet was held at the Pure Land Nunnery on Guling Road. When I went to offer my birthday greetings at five o'clock, the stage was already performing "You Long Xi Feng," with Zhuang Mengwen playing Emperor Zhengde and Zhang Xuezhen (also known as Qiuyun Yan) playing Feng Jie. Mr. Zhuang's performance was quite good. Miss Zhang's costume and makeup were beautiful and flawless. Next was "Scolding the Court," with Cheng Zhongfan playing Zhao Kuangyi and Zhang Yafu playing Empress He. These two gentlemen are very knowledgeable in this art, and their pronunciation and singing were accurate and pleasant. Then, Miss Qiuyun Yan performed a scene from "Thirteenth Sister at Nengren Temple," with Zhu Meiyu playing Zhang Jinfeng and Yun Bao cheng playing An Ji. Miss Qiuyun Yan, performing this important role, although her throat was slightly hoarse, still sang clearly and pleasantly. Her acting and martial arts were meticulous. Mr. Zhu's costume was beautiful, his singing was crisp, and his every move was proper. Mr. Yun, who originally specialized in Qingyi roles, has recently been practicing all kinds of roles, Sheng and Chou. This was his first time playing a Xiaosheng role, and although there were some unfamiliar aspects, he was still an experienced performer and was able to express the identity of the character, adding a lot of color to the play. Next was "Zhuliang Village," with Mr. Wu Qidong playing Li Keyong, Mr. Cheng Zhongfan playing Cheng Jingsi, and Mr. Wang Pinzhi playing the Grand Tutor. Therefore, applause and cheers rose from all sides. Following this, Zhu and Mei, Mr. Bao Zhongxiang, Mrs. Wang Pinzhi all collaborated on a performance of "The Second Part of Rainbow Pass," which was excellent. After "Rainbow Pass" came Yang Shuomin and Shi Bingyong's "June Snow." I was invited to dinner at this time and was unable to watch, which I deeply regret. However, I could hear from afar that both gentlemen's voices were extremely high and clear. When I returned to the front of the stage, Zhao Yaonian, Mrs. Su Xiaxuan, and Mr. Wu Qidong's "Celebrating the Pearl on Top" had already been performed several times. Mr. Wu's "Great Teacher" spoke the local dialect of Peiping clearly and lively, and his performance was full of highlights, which was very rare. Next was Mrs. Zhou Shucheng and Mrs. Wu Qidong's "Double Golden Lotus." Mrs. Zhou's singing and Mrs. Wu's acting were both commendable. The finale was Chen Baode's "Dingjun Mountain." Mr. Chen is a veteran amateur performer of more than ten years. This was probably his first time performing a heavy opera with weapons, but after all, he was an experienced performer and was different from the others. His singing, dialogue, acting, and martial arts were all very commendable. It was a pity that his Wuxi accent was a minor flaw in his otherwise perfect performance. The performance ended near midnight, and I hurried home.</p>

<h3>Three Performers Each Display Their Talents</h3>
<p>— Book Belt Scholar</p>
<p>Zhao Jinrong, the new performer in the second season at the Gengxin Theatre, has been on stage for two weeks since taking over from Wu Suqiu. Her popularity and reputation are comparable to those of the female Marquis, Hou Yulan. In the past few days, Jinrong's voice has suddenly improved, and her singing and acting in "The Jade Hairpin," "A Handful of Snow," "Ti Ying Saves Her Father," "The Mandarin Duck Tomb" and other plays have become even more brilliant. Wu Suqiu cannot claim exclusive excellence.</p>
<p>Today's "Visiting Mother" was specially requested by Mrs. Du. The new costumes given by the ladies' group will be revealed to the audience tonight. Starting on Monday, Liang Yunqiu, the top disciple of Xun Huisheng, will take over. There will also be many supporters, including the esteemed Lawyer E and his wife, as well as the descendants of a banking tycoon and the Three More Generals. Yunqiu's popularity can also be predicted.</p>
<p>After Liang Yunqiu, Wu Suqiu has decided to continue performing for another week. The number of reserved seats has already exceeded 400. When she performs, the situation will be even more enthusiastic than the first time, it can be asserted.</p>
<h3>Bankers Association Friendship Gathering</h3>
<p>—— Peking Opera Grand Rehearsal</p>
<p>The city's Banking Industry Amateur Friendship Association recently invited famous amateur Peking opera performers and celebrities from the financial industry to hold a grand Peking opera rehearsal at the Golden Grand Theatre on October 30, 31, and November 1, with three evening performances, in order to develop the welfare of colleagues and enrich funds. Ticket prices are sold at four levels: five corners, one yuan, two yuan, and three yuan. The association's office is located at 334 Nanjing Road, on the upper floors of the Banque Franco-Chinoise, and ticket sales have begun.</p>
<p>This morning at 9 o'clock, the American Church Music Concert at the Da Guangming Cinema specially invited Miss Xia Guoxiu, the younger sister of Shanghai pianist Xia Guoqiong, to perform a solo. Miss Xia is a talented disciple of Madame BershaskyN. Music lovers are welcome to attend.</p>
<p>(The image above is Miss Xia)</p>
<h3>Liang Yunqiu</h3>
<p>Liang Yunqiu, the new performer at Gengxin, is originally from Changsha, Hunan. Her father, Jia Yi, studied in the United States for nine years and graduated from Columbia University. After returning to China, he served as a professor at various universities in Peiping for many years, and later entered politics. Yunqiu was by his side. She loved Peking Opera. In 1933, her father died in Peiping, and the family's financial situation deteriorated. She had no choice but to study opera under a teacher. Finally, she became a disciple of the famous Dan Xun Huisheng, and her skills greatly improved. This is her first time being invited to Shanghai. Yunqiu's complete versions of "Hong Niang" and "Xun Guan Niang" are famous throughout Peiping and Tianjin and will be performed soon.</p>
<h3>New Film Introduction "Iron Horse"</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"Union Pacific"</p>
<p>When a difficult undertaking is first proposed, there are bound to be those who blindly oppose it, dismissing it as a dream; at the same time, those who are directly affected by the interests will certainly come out to obstruct it. The former lacks far-sightedness, content with the current situation; the latter only knows their own interests, and ignores the interests of the public. The story of "Iron Horse" tells the story of President Lincoln, after the Civil War, uniquely signed the transcontinental railroad connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Before the construction was half completed, President Lincoln was assassinated. Financier Barrows planned to manipulate railway stocks and secretly instructed the rogue Sid to obstruct the construction of the railway. The company then hired Jeff to clear up the conspiracies and obstacles. After many difficulties, the railway was completed. This also clarifies that for the sake of great undertakings and the interests of the public, even Jeff and Dick, who are in opposing positions, will eventually work together when their lives are at stake—although in the end it still fully demonstrates the narrow prejudice of discriminating against people of color, but the theme of the play lies in the loyalty to the cause, and the lesson of cooperation between the opposing parties. Can we have even more demanding demands on American movies for the time being? The puppet in "Splendor in the Grass" is a better example.</p>
<p>Cecil B. DeMille's directing style is known for its bold strokes. Reading these two lines of advertising, "Snow Mountain collapses, speeding car passes through the bridge of fire," one should also believe in the greatness of the film's scenery. But I always feel that some places are too wasteful, such as Jeff (Joel McCrea), Dick (Robert Preston), and Molly (Barbara Stanwyck) being able to end after defeating the Indians. The climax of the "Snow Mountain Collapse" later is not only wasteful, but also destroys the complete atmosphere of the play. If it is to strengthen the tragic atmosphere, it is enough for Molly to be injured. Last year, "The New Water Margin" was released, and in the two scenes of the burning of the White House and the pirate looting, the same director used candles to light the curtains and a long shot and "faded out." In fact, deliberately using a large scene on branch scenes is actually overwhelming.</p>
<p>Joel McCrea, Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Preston are all excellent, especially in the three scenes where Dick gets the money, meets Jeff at Molly's house, Jeff captures Dick, Molly designs to let Dick go, and attacks the Indians in the overturned car, which are even more brilliant.</p>

<h3>European War Special Issue: Bird's-Eye View of the Situation in Northern Europe</h3>
<p>— Fang Qi</p>
<p>The Winds and Clouds of the Baltic Sea</p>
<p>Attitude towards Finland</p>
<p>Finland has become the center of the Northern European issue</p>
<p>The cause of the European issue was in Poland, but the most complex situation is still in the Balkans, and the first to change the situation is the countries on the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea. The Polish issue must now wait for the outcome of the war. Everyone is trying to avoid triggering the Balkan issue (or, everyone is trying to trigger it after creating a situation that is beneficial to them). If it is triggered, the scale of the European war will have to be expanded. The issue on the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea is that Germany does not intervene in a way that is understood, and other powers are practically unable to intervene. Therefore, the Soviet Union, in a one-sided manner, first successfully completed diplomatic negotiations with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Then, the negotiations with Finland, although there were many twists and turns, have not yet been successful, but the reversed situation may not come. However, assuming that the result of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations is also similar to the results of the Soviet-Estonian negotiations, the issue of the Baltic Sea is not completely over. One is that Finland is one of the four countries of the Stockholm Conference. Although the appearance of the four-country conference is only to reiterate neutrality, the timing of the meeting is clearly linked to the Finnish issue. Regardless of whether the future resolution of the Soviet-Finnish issue is in line with the hopes of the Stockholm Conference, the four Nordic countries have always been inseparable from the European issue. Second, after the Soviet Union controlled the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea, in order to reduce future friction with Germany, it agreed with Germany to send German overseas Chinese back to their countries. When those who shout the slogan of Aryan rights accept this most straightforward solution to ethnic issues, they cannot avoid containing hidden pain. The importance of these two smaller things may not be less than that of several mutual assistance treaties, but I will not speculate on the future. Let's look back at the negotiations that have already been completed.</p>
<p>The Relationship between the Soviet Union and Estonia</p>
<p>The earliest one signed was the Soviet-Estonian mutual assistance treaty, which was established on September 28. The start of the negotiations was only a few days earlier. At the beginning of October, the Soviet Union and Estonia began negotiations, and the Soviet-Latvian mutual assistance treaty was established on the 5th. The Soviet-Lithuanian negotiations took longer and went through some twists and turns, but the mutual assistance treaty was also established on October 10. The establishment of the three treaties was completed within half a month, and the clauses were roughly the same. Among them, such as stipulating the territory "When any direct aggression or threat of aggression occurs, the other party will provide all assistance, including military assistance." "The Soviet Union promises to assist the army of a certain country with weapons and other military equipment under favorable conditions." "The two countries undertake not to conclude or participate in any alliance or group of countries hostile to the contracting countries." "The implementation of this treaty shall not affect the sovereignty of the two contracting countries in any way... still be the territory of a certain country." And the term, establishment, and other clauses are exactly the same. Article 3 of the Soviet-Estonian and Soviet-Latvian treaties, and Article 4 of the Soviet-Lithuanian treaties, stipulate the stationing of troops in the respective countries. The former two treaties list the locations for stationing troops, including Saaremaa Island, Hiiumaa Island, Paldiski Town (all in Estonia), Liepāja, and Ventspils (all in Latvia). The methods of stationing troops and defense are also slightly different. The latter treaty does not specify it. The Soviet-Lithuanian treaty has two more clauses, one is Article 1 "...The Soviet Union agrees to cede the city and province of Vilnius to the Republic of Lithuania..." (originally seized by Poland, an area of 10,400 square miles), and one is Article 5 "...In the event of aggression, the two contracting countries shall immediately discuss the situation arising therefrom..." All of these provisions have now been largely implemented.</p>
<p>Differences of Opinion between the Soviet and Finnish Negotiations</p>
<p>The Soviet-Finnish negotiations, from the arrival of the Finnish delegation in Moscow on October 11 for negotiations, ended with the Finnish representatives returning home for instructions on the 15th. The initial results were not announced. In the middle, there was the Stockholm Conference. After the conference ended, the Finnish representatives returned to Moscow on the 22nd for negotiations, and returned home for instructions again on the 24th. According to the speech of the Finnish Foreign Minister on the 16th, "The nature of the current negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union is extremely delicate. If news is published before the negotiations are successful, the danger is great. Therefore, it is not convenient to disclose the content at this time. There are many foreign rumors about the content of the demands made by the Soviet government to our country... can be easily believed... Finland has expressed its commitment to peace and is willing to negotiate with the Soviet Union, but this does not mean that we are prepared to sacrifice freedom and survival... Any agreement that facilitates other countries to use our territory in a way that we do not want is unacceptable to us, and any group that is hostile to any country is not willing to join." It can be seen that the opinions of the two sides are still very far apart. Or it is possible to bring out a third country to participate in the opinions.</p>
<p>The territory of Finland is 134,557 square miles, slightly smaller than Poland, but larger than mainland Italy, but the population is only 3.7 million. As for the other three countries, Estonia has an area of over 18,000 square miles and a population of over 1 million; Latvia has an area of over 24,000 square miles and a population of 2 million, Lithuania has an area of over 21,000 square miles (excluding Vilnius) and a population of 2.5 million. This comparison also explains why the Finnish issue is more complicated.</p>
<h3>An Analysis of the Situation in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>— A Lone Walker</p>
<p>The Crossroads of Conflicting Interests of Various Countries British Advantage in the Eastern Mediterranean</p>
<p>Since the failure of the Soviet-Turkish negotiations and the completion of the British-French-Turkish mutual assistance treaty, the world's attention has shifted to the Mediterranean. This vast ocean was originally the place where countries in ancient Europe, Asia, and Africa fought; after the outbreak of this World War, the Mediterranean once again became a battlefield. The Mediterranean is not like the Baltic Sea, where the opponents are only Germany and Poland. Its situation is complex and is the crossroads of conflicting interests of countries such as Britain, France, Italy, and Turkey.</p>
<p>Patrolling Along the Coast</p>
<p>Now let's patrol along the coast. Since the outbreak of the war, Egypt has immediately mobilized more than 20,000 soldiers to support Britain; Libya has 120,000 troops before the Italian army withdraws: French Morocco and Algeria are France's warehouses and also the source of combat manpower. Crossing from the south coast to the north coast, the situation is a little more complicated. France's two naval bases close to Italy - Toulon and Villefranche - protect France's transportation to Africa and threaten the coastal cities of Italy.</p>
<p>In addition, the Suez Canal in the far east of the Mediterranean, Malta in the middle of the Mediterranean, the islands around Greece, and the entrance to the Black Sea, the Dardanelles Strait, form a complex network filled with danger and explosiveness.</p>
<p>British Strategy</p>
<p>During the Italian-Ethiopian War in 1935, Britain's position in the Mediterranean was once shaken, because its military port in Malta was extremely vulnerable to attacks by Italian air force and submarines; later, Britain accelerated the construction of a large naval base in Alexandria to replace the port of Malta, and only then did it stabilize its position in the Mediterranean. The British Navy's strategy in the Mediterranean, in short, is based on the following four principles: (1) France must maintain a large fleet in the Western Mediterranean, equipped with the latest anti-submarine defenses, to ensure its transportation with Africa; (2) Britain establishes a powerful fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean and uses the islands near Greece, the Italian fleet will certainly not dare to leave its base, because (3) if the Italian fleet comes out to attack the British fleet in the east, the French fleet can directly attack the nest from behind, if it wants to attack the French navy in the west, the British fleet can attack its back from the east; (4) Cut off Italy's transportation with Libya.</p>
<p>If Italy really maintains neutrality, the supply of manpower and materials in North Africa can be continuously imported into France, and at the same time, Britain and France can freely provide assistance to Turkey, Romania, and Greece.</p>
<p>Turkish Position</p>
<p>As for Turkey, she has 1.2 million troops, has excellent arsenals, has 450 aircraft, and her navy can be called the strongest in the Black Sea and can compete with the enemy. Since the Dardanelles Strait was fortified, the cannons deployed there are the latest products from Germany, and her anti-aircraft guns are manufactured by major European factories. Turkey not only controls the Dardanelles Strait, but also the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, and Greece, which are all within her sphere of influence in wartime. Therefore, since the outbreak of the war, Germany and the Soviet Union have made great efforts to win over Turkey; and because she is the most powerful background in the Balkan Peninsula, the activities of German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen in Turkey are well known. Now that the British-French-Turkish mutual assistance treaty has been completed, it has temporarily stabilized the overall situation in the Balkan Peninsula and given Romania a backing; and Britain has also established its advantage in the Eastern Mediterranean. Turkey and Greece naturally do not worry about any attacks from the sea.</p>

<h3>Intelligence Directors of Britain, France, and Germany</h3>
<p>— Chrysanthemum</p>
<p>The role of news in wartime has three aspects: first, to demoralize the enemy; second, to encourage one's own troops; and third, to give a good impression to neutral countries. The propaganda agencies of the participating countries in the last major war assumed these three missions, and this European war is certainly no exception. The attached photos are of the current intelligence directors of Britain, France, and Germany.</p>
<p>On the right is British Intelligence Director Macmillan, who is 66 years old. At the age of 24, he was already practicing law in Scotland, and at the age of 27, he was the editor of the Legal Review. Now Chamberlain has given him this important position, hoping that he will carefully select news during the war. The News Censorship Office has now been established.</p>
<p>In the middle is French Intelligence Director Giraudoux, who wrote a novel at the age of 39, which was the most interesting creation in modern France and was popular for a time. He is now 56 years old.</p>
<p>On the left is German Propaganda Minister Goebbels. His duties are naturally numerous, and news is also under his control. Last year, he praised Hitler's merits, saying: "Germany, which had no assistance after the European war, has become the most powerful country in the world in five years." There was a time when newspapers reported that he was beaten for flirting with a movie star. This famous Minister Goebbels, unlike the other two, is relatively unfamiliar. Originally, in Germany, propaganda is considered more important than anything else. After Germany failed in the last major war, it did not blame it on military affairs, but thought that propaganda was not as good as others. At that time, Hindenburg said: "The enemy poisoned our spirit, and the leaflets issued by his aviation personnel came to kill our souls. And the aggressors must "wag their tongues like reeds" to confuse the hearing." This is the reason why Germany attaches importance to the propaganda organs, so its propaganda minister is also particularly familiar to people.</p>

<h3>The Lucky Ones of War: News Reporters Who Became Famous Overnight (Scholar)</h3>
<p>With the outbreak of war, the progress of the war has become the daily headline in various newspapers. Obtaining war news is not only the main goal of every newspaper office but also the object of every war correspondent's efforts. At such a time, a news reporter on the front line is as closely watched as an important general commanding troops on the front line.</p>
<p>During this European war, several American news reporters gained prominence by chance in Warsaw. One was Lee Turck-Morey, the son of Scott Morey, the editor of the Chicago Daily News, and the nephew of Edgar Morey, the author of "Germany Turns Back the Clock" and "Morey in China," who visited China last year. His trip to Warsaw was thanks to the Italian authorities' deportation, accusing him of "spreading rumors." After the Polish war became tense, there was a time when he was said to have disappeared. Two days later, he finally appeared in Romania and published his detailed report on the Soviet occupation of Poland in the Chicago Daily News. He said that he suffered a lot on his way from Poland to Romania. In the dark of night, he swam across the Dniester River and climbed over steep cliffs to reach Romanian territory. His first action after entering Romania was naturally to find the nearest telegraph office to send out his moving news!</p>
<p>Another Associated Press reporter was named Little Beatty. He also fled from Warsaw to Bucharest, the capital of Romania. He brought nothing with him except the clothes on his back. The war news that these two people gathered in Poland and Romania is now published daily in American newspapers with large headlines and has become a very popular news figure in the United States.</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Carrier Courageous Sunk by German Submarine</h3>
<p>The British aircraft carrier Courageous (see left picture), which was sunk by a German submarine northwest of the Irish coast on September 18, was built in 1917. It was originally a cruiser but was later converted into an aircraft carrier. It has a displacement of 22,500 tons and can carry 48 aircraft. The deck is equipped with sixteen 4.7-inch anti-aircraft guns, and the speed is 30.5 knots per hour. The thickest part of the armor is only three inches, which is almost the same as the armor of a 7,000-ton cruiser. Therefore, once attacked by a submarine, it was fatally hit and sank within 30 minutes. The entire ship had 1,260 naval officers. When the ship was attacked, all the officers on board jumped into the water. Those who could not swim clung to wooden boards. British cruisers rushed to the rescue upon hearing the news, and British, American, and Dutch merchant ships also came to help. As a result, 759 people survived, and 501 were missing. The loss cannot be said to be small.</p>
<p>It is also said that the sister ship of the Courageous is the Glorious, which is also a 25,000-ton aircraft carrier.</p>
<h3>650,000 Children Evacuated from London to Safe Areas</h3>
<p>Regarding the various preparations for evacuating children to safe areas during wartime, London, the capital of England, is the most complete. The plan is to evacuate 650,000 schoolchildren in London to safe areas in units of schools, living in designated rural families, and educating them in rural schools on a two-shift system. Two days before the declaration of war on Germany, on Friday morning, all the schoolchildren were ready, lined up to enter the school, received the last lesson, and then took the first free train to the designated location. After arriving, each person sent a postcard that had been issued in advance to their home to report their safety. In addition, each person's clothing was sewn with their name and address. In total, schoolchildren in London and the other 28 cities were evacuated in the shortest possible time. During the evacuation, these innocent and lively schoolchildren mostly embarked on their journey with joy. Those who showed sadness or cried were because their families came to see them off, which inevitably made them reluctant to leave, but this was only a very small number. The picture on the left shows the situation of schoolchildren being evacuated from London.</p>
<h3>Radio Broadcasting War in the European War</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Doing Everything Possible in Propaganda Attacks</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Second European War, although no fierce fighting has been seen on the Western Front, both sides have been using leaflets, pamphlets, and especially radio to attack each other, doing everything possible. This is the so-called propaganda war, the ideological war—an invisible war that is fiercely going on at all times.</p>
<p>Invisible War</p>
<p>Radio waves have no borders and cannot be inspected or blocked. As long as there is a shortwave radio, broadcasts from any country in the world can be received. As long as there is a powerful broadcasting station, all kinds of propaganda that benefits oneself can be made to any place in the world, especially within enemy territory. This is the most effective offensive weapon, so in peacetime, all countries devote themselves to enriching broadcasting equipment, and in wartime, they make full and effective use of it.</p>
<p>Currently, 38 countries in the world use shortwave radio for regular broadcasts, with a total of 340 radio stations. Among them, the most powerful are undoubtedly Germany, Italy, Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union, all of which have dozens or even hundreds of kilowatts of power and broadcast in several—at least six—languages.</p>
<p>Everyone Uses Radio Stations</p>
<p>Hitler's declaration of war on Poland was accompanied by a speech entitled "War or Death!" which was broadcast to the world via powerful radio waves. Later, Chamberlain's painful speech declaring war on Germany, King George VI's speech, French Prime Minister Daladier's speech saying "French people! Arise for honor and freedom!" and Goering's speech at a military factory near Berlin were all broadcast to the world via radio.</p>
<p>They all claimed to be peace-loving and shifted the responsibility for the war to the other side. At the same time, if there was any news that was unfavorable to them, they would try their best to defend themselves and show their integrity. For example, Britain once broadcast that "the plane that dropped bombs on Denmark is now known to be a British plane, and we apologize to the Danish government." For any news that could damage their interests, they would try their best to exaggerate it. For example, in the "Aestonian ship sunk by a German submarine" incident, Britain broadcast to the United States that "the German submarine sank the ship without warning, and most of the American passengers were killed." On the other hand, Germany said that "the ship was deliberately sunk by its own destroyer by Britain to drag the United States into the war."</p>
<p>Characteristics of Propaganda in Various Countries</p>
<p>The propaganda of each country has its own characteristics for the same news. Generally speaking, the German language is strong and threatening, while the British are skilled in compiling and speaking cleverly. The German sounds like a loud shout, the British sound like a conversation between two people, the Americans are full of humor, the Italians are honest, the French are noisy, and the Soviets are cold. This is the difference in the propaganda styles of various countries.</p>
<p>The Most Effective Weapon</p>
<p>In addition to its propaganda role, radio broadcasting can also be directly used as a weapon in wartime. This has been well tested in the Spanish Civil War, where the government army and the Nationalist army each had their own radio stations to transmit important military orders. For example, when the Nationalist army was holding on to Alcazar, the report of the departure of the reinforcements was disrupted by the government army's radio station and failed to be received, resulting in the surrender before the reinforcements arrived. At the same time, the government army used the same wavelength as the enemy to transmit false orders, which was successful.</p>
<p>The second is the battle for the Warsaw broadcasting station in this war. After the German army reported that Warsaw had been occupied, the Warsaw shortwave station soon announced: "Warsaw has not fallen, we are still defending it." This surprised the world. According to a German telegram from Budapest, from September 8 to 9, there were three radio stations near Warsaw conducting fierce propaganda warfare on the same wavelength. One used Polish with a German accent, saying "Warsaw is in the hands of the German army, and the citizens must quickly disarm." But at the same time, the second radio station said "it has not fallen and is still defending it." Every one to three minutes, there would be a completely opposite message. Even today, when Warsaw has completely fallen, reports from Colonel Libinsky and Mayor Steydinsky of the Warsaw defense forces can still be heard on the radio. This is even more surprising.</p>
<p>Because radio stations are the best weapons for propaganda warfare, the competition between the two sides is more focused on than a city or a fortress. Once they break into the enemy's capital, the first target to occupy is the radio station. And before the occupation, it is even more of a target for enemy aircraft to bomb.</p>
<h3>French Parachute Rescue Team from the Sky</h3>
<p>Although France does not have an official women's service corps during wartime, there are many private organizations that train women to serve the country. One of the most unique and interesting is the parachute women's rescue team, which was founded by Mrs. de Naimen, and the funding was also provided by her. She is a brave woman who likes sports and can ride horses. In 1935, she obtained a license from the government allowing her to practice parachuting. In 1936, she organized this unique parachute rescue team. The French Air Force Department recognized this group as one of the public welfare undertakings and could serve in the Air Force Department after an emergency. When Mrs. de Naimen started the team, there were only three members, but now there are 50 members and 200 reserve members. They all participate voluntarily, so they include people from all walks of life. They learn various parachute skills. Members receive three months of training and are then tested by the French Aeronautics Society. The graduation period is six months.</p>
<p>The main task of the members is emergency rescue. Therefore, a parachute rescuer must not only have rescue knowledge, but also be a parachute expert. To meet these conditions, in addition to having a national nursing certificate, they also need to have a strong physique, a spirit of courage and determination, and a firm will.</p>
<p>The talents trained by this group are not used as ordinary nurses, but as emergency rescuers in wartime and for rescue in special occasions. These rescuers can rescue soldiers trapped in heavy mountains and steep ridges, or wounded soldiers far away from military hospitals.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of this war, the French Air Force Department has ordered this group to be directly under its command. Now, these white-clad female warriors from the sky may already be active on the front lines.</p>

<p>Since the European War, a new blue book has been published in London bookstores. This book contains official telegrams, speeches, and correspondence, all of which explain that Hitler is the culprit of this war. This book is widely sold, selling 1,000 copies per hour.</p>
<p>The French police do not restrict personal actions, but everyone must carry a gas mask when going out, or they will be fined.</p>
<p>Paris nightlife is now limited to 11:00 pm. Slogans such as "Early to bed and early to rise" and "We have good gas mask facilities" are posted in front of Paris stores to attract business.</p>
<p>After the signing of the German-Soviet treaty, Hitler believed that many anti-Soviet phrases in his book "Mein Kampf" were sufficient to harm German-Soviet relations, and he has now ordered all public libraries to suspend lending it. Steel-reinforced concrete anti-tank barriers (four to ten feet high) are used to overturn tanks when they are trapped, and flat-trajectory guns hidden behind them will destroy them.</p>
