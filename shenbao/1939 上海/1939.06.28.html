<p>根據蘇日兩方之宣傳，關於兩軍衝突之成績，究竟孰蒙較重之損失，究竟孰佔俊勢，證據不足，遽難論斷。然以常識論之：蘇聯承認於五月二十八日，空軍以猝不及備而自損九架，毀彼三架，自不諱敗；而日本所自述，則戰無不勝；此其一。蘇聯於空戰，所述雙方機數，每相彷彿，損失之數，蘇較少，日較多，而尙相接近；日本於空戰，所述雙方機數，每爲蘇衆而日寡，損失之數，蘇必五倍十倍於日；此其一。即此二端，固無從發見其最準確之實况，然日方誇張至於常識所得判斷其爲妄，則日本在一宣傳戰」方面，顯然敗矣；宣傳務眞誠，至少亦必接近眞實，日本式之宣傳，務誇大而不求取信，自昔旣然，於蘇日衝突事，其一例而已。</p>
<p>衝突之由來，蘇日各責對方犯界；謂犯界，是主動，是攻勢，亦即責任所歸；我人又無法根據兩方之宣傳而評定其責任。顧就大體言之：蘇聯政府在其根本政策上，決不願參預戰爭，更不願發動戰爭，日本政府在其國際政策上，但願不獨力戰蘇聯，在此侵華兩年，實力垂竭之際，惟恐蘇聯尋釁，詎願啟釁蘇聯；此爲兩方之實情，我人竊信爲恰合事理，於是演繹，此决衝突，非由東京或莫斯科所發縱指使；而昨日德國海通社東京電稱，東京政界中人謂衝突非個別事件，而爲莫斯科有組織之行動，藉以牽制日軍，遙助中國云云，又爲別有作用之歪曲宣傳也明矣。以別有作用而論，蘇聯國情單純，政府取舍輙不離乎根本政策，故別有作用之「小動作」較爲不必要；日本則對內對外，圖進圖退，其國情國策皆非蘇聯之此，故其當國者輒有時而需要別有作用之小動作，允於製造宣傳資料爲然。抑如是云云者，我人猶未以爲衝突之發動於東京。不由東京，更不由莫斯科，則衝突乃爲當地駐軍之個別行動也明矣。以個別行動而論，我人姑不以蘇聯所發表日軍第甘三師團長之密令（見昨報）爲日方發動之鐵證，然不妨並舉二問：一蘇聯駐軍，違反莫斯科政策，未奉莫斯科命令而襲擊日軍防綫乎？一日本駐軍違反東京政策，未奉東京命令而襲擊蘇軍防綫乎？此一者，孰有其先例，孰有其習慣，孰有其較高之可能乎？衝突乃兩方之事，然決非兩方不的而同時發動；故必有其一焉，是主動，取攻勢，負責任！竊信此决衝突，以日本駐軍主動之可能爲較高。</p>
<p>我人未欲自作解人，以解釋他人之一切。茲僅假定前述之推論爲不謬，析求發動衝突之理智；則以爲日本在國際之悲歡離合，徬徨歧途，蓋有其內在之矛盾焉，於是而演爲支離之行動。彼有極右者，主張敵蘇聯，絕英國，而與德義澈底同盟；有中和者，主張與德義保持對蘇聯之陣綫，而避免對英法美摩擦之加深。二者在國內旗鼓相稱而在迭爲消長之中。圍天津租界，在汕頭登陸，乃至於與蘇聯駐軍交鬨，即所以驅中和者不得不絕英國，亦所以使蘇日關係之意外緊張而促進對德義之關係。同時表示蘇日關係之惡化，使英國望而却步，放棄其聯蘇，亦即所以自効於德義而加强德義日之團結。東奔西突，其間固有其一貫之意識爲之綫索也。</p>

<p>（倫敦）據前海軍情報處長奧期朋少將今日在廣播演說中稱、假若遠東方面英日一旦發生戰爭英國必能獲勝、一余深信英日戰爭發生之後、中國之抗戰力量、必能加强、結果日木必因精力耗竭而崩潰、即使在歐洲方面同時亦發生大戰、英國海軍主力、不能不側重歐洲方面、我人亦能戰勝日本、」屆時英國海軍必須先集中歐洲、解决德義、然後揮戈東指、進攻日本、故在遠東英日戰爭發生之初、英國海軍對日本、祗能以新加坡爲根據、採取守勢、必能確保新加坡以西及澳洲新西蘭之地而有餘、至於對於中國之援助、亦能藉滇緬公路鐵路及空中運輸、源源接濟、故英國對日之勝利、實可操左券也、（二十六日美聯電）</p>

<p>甬輪駛滬</p>
<p>自定海失陷後、寗波因距離較近、情勢遂趨緊張、本市航業界即盛傳甬江有重行禁航消息、直至目前、始悉寗波防守司令部為加緊鎭海口防務、决定暫行禁航、本市某輪公司以未接正式電吿、會於前日下午去電探詢、文云、「聞寗波將封航、確吾、盼覆、」旋於當晚八時接甬方覆電云、「電悉、禁航屬實、留甬各輪、均定二十七日晨駛滬、」故禁航消息、業吿證實、所有留甬之外輪、如中意之德平·禮和之謀福·太古之新北京·三輪、均於昨晨六時前離甬駛滬、巳於當晚七時左右先後到滬、惟據德商禮和洋行消息、該行之謀福輪、經甬當局特准、常有續駛一班之可能、但能吾開航、須俟甬方來電决定、</p>
<p>缺口不堵</p>
<p>昨據航業界消息、鎭海口此次再度禁航、完全為鞏固要塞防務、性質與以前相同、如局勢轉鬆、可望即行開放、故封鎖綫上所留之通航缺口、不致堵塞、留備沉作堵口之老太平輪、現悉仍泊鎭海招商局碼頭、非至必不得已時、决不下沉、蓋萬一堵塞、則今後開放、殊屬困難也、</p>
<p>兩輪泊甬</p>
<p>行駛甬定航綫之德商魯麟洋行高登輪、於二十三日會由甬駛定、因該處發生戰事、遂逕駛石浦、茲已由石浦回甬、因定海交通受阻、故决停航、在甬暫泊、又德商施毅德洋行之天寶輪、亦暫泊停航、俟甬江開放後、再行决定航綫、</p>
<p>日方阻撓</p>
<p>日軍在定海登陸後、又企圖進窺鎭海及甌江要塞、昨晨據航業界消息、甌江口外、泊有日艦多艘、並有飛機環繞起飛、英商的翰馬勒輪、昨晨駛黃華關口外時、突遭日艦攔阻進口、該輪無奈、祇得折回、同時日海軍當局、並通知第三國航商、謂日軍將在甌江及閩海有所行動、故勸阻外商輪隻、切勿駛入浙閩口岸、吾則發生損害、日方不負責任、</p>
<p>恩德折回</p>
<p>中意公司之恩德輪、原定二十六日下午直放寗波、旅因接獲寗波禁航消息、故臨時於昨晨改駛溫州、詎昨晨突接日方阻航消息、故復於上午發無綫電囑恩德輪開回上海、該輪接公司電吿後、即行中途折回、業於昨日下午二時半進口、又德商魯麟洋行之飛康輪、意商華義洋行之實利愉、均於昨晨七時駛溫、但均經中途折回、太古洋行之凉州·穎州等輪、則决改駛香港、又德商遠東公司之哈納輪、已於昨晨八時離溫返滬、禮和洋行之海福輪、則於昨晚到滬、能吾開航、須視局勢如何、再行决定、</p>
<p>日圖穿山</p>
<p>穿山在定海之西南、相隔一港之遙、輪行二小時可達、該處為鎭海縣屬、陸路可達寗波、自定海失陷後、當局為加强防務、即經在該處加緊戒備、嚴密防範、查該處港口極狹、水道頗淺、日艦無法駛近、且兩旁均係山地、華方置有堅强工事、及築有砲位、故防務極為鞏固、據航業界昨午後接甬方電吿、謂日軍三百餘、由日艦三艘掩護、咋午企圖在穿山登陸、經當時水警團隊猛烈痛擊、日軍受創退去、無法得逞、但該處情勢、則仍極緊張、</p>
<p>破壞公路</p>
<p>浙東沿海各公路因軍事上之關係、均已先後破壞、如溫州至靑田段、寗波至曹娥段、曹娥至蕭山段、寗波至穿山段、江口至溪口段、至溪口至新昌段、寗波防守司令頃已飭奉化新昌兩縣政府、及鄞奉長途汽車公司、準備候命、實施繼續破壞、聞必要時、决將浙省各公路、隨時視軍事上之需要、予以破壞、現麗水經過永康至金華段、以及金華蘭溪龍海衢州段、仍暫通車、</p>
<p>舟山情狀</p>
<p>據由舟山羣島乘帆船抵滬之避難旅客報吿、定海之沈家門、於二十一日晨、為日機六架不斷轟炸、及日艦之砲轟、地方有相當損失、繼即有日軍登陸、雖經自衛團等猛力抵抗、終因寡不敵衆、於是陷落、聞定海縣城之淪陷、在沈家門之後、今自衛團等由蘇縣長率領、退至靑嶺一帶、實行遊擊戰、隨時予日軍重創、至於居民、均已撒退至四郊深山中、縣城已成死市、</p>
<p>日方之照會</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、據上海領事團發出消息、日海軍當局今（廿六日）晨宣稱、今日對華方手中之沿海口岸福州與溫州、開始軍事行動、請兩地之外國軍艦與商輪於星期五日午前悉數退出指定區域、僑居該兩城之第三國人民儘可能迅速撇退、日海軍送達領事團之照會宣稱、在上述時間以後、仍泊兩港之船隻、或將遭受直接或間接的損失、日當局不能負任何責任云、截至今午為止、上海未接關於日方所宣佈對福州與溫州有軍事行動之消息、查福州為閩省省會、近始遷徙、溫州為近閩邊之浙省口岸、亦在華方手中入內地的最</p>
<p>重要門戶</p>
<p>之一自日軍在汕頭登陸後、該兩城頗為緊張、甫自星期一日恢復之滬甬直航、今日叉吿停止、日海軍侵佔舟山島後、鎭海與寗波隨時將遭日軍進犯、衆信日軍將利用該島為進犯鎭海與寗波之根據地、因而完畢其對中國海岸之封鎖、日軍致領事團要求外輪外僑退出福州與溫州之</p>
<p>照會如下</p>
<p>（一）一九三九年六月二十七日、日海軍將對福州與溫州開始軍事行動、故請二十九日午刻（日本時間）以前泊溫州之第三國軍艦與商輪悉數駛往東經一一二·一五度以東之海面、泊福州者、均駛往東經一一九·五〇度以東、為軍事需要之故、自上述之時間起、該兩口岸之入口處、將用危險物與其他阻障物</p>
<p>加以封鎖</p>
<p>、故船隻將不能出入該兩港口、在上述時間之後、留泊該兩港口之船隻或將遭受直接或問接的損失、日當局不能負任何責任、（二）溫州與福州附近區域、旣將成作戰區、故請僑居此等區域中之第三國人民、從速撤退云、</p>
<p>英國當局</p>
<p>對此警吿、刻作對汕頭警吿相同之答覆云、日方負有不得干涉英艦行動、或危害英人生命產業之責任、此項警吿、作為日方卸其上述責任者、英政府不能接受、因英輪包括軍艦在內、駛往中國水面任何地點、及留泊所有通商口岸之權利、以及英人僑居溫州與福州附近之權利、均不受影嚮也、</p>

<p>滙價暴跌　費用增加</p>
<p>茲據該公司聲明、此次所擬加價一節、實因本年四月以前之一年間、國幣匯價暴跌、營業費用增加甚多、以致勢在必行、不勝遺憾、當經工部局公用事業委員會於本年五月十九日詳加討論</p>

<h3 id="c89">夫婦欲求永愛的先決問題 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>人們的所以為萬物之靈，就是因為有智識，感情和意志的緣故、他們並不斤斤較量於目前，而必須爭取最後的勝利；所以只圖孤注一擲於一時者，這並不是人們的高級的行為。齊年男女的選擇配偶，誰不審慎再三，以求永相恩愛白首偕老？至於夫婦而中途愛馳、貌合神離、同床異夢、或竟與此離之訟者、必因夫婦的任何一方、發現了他們不能永愛的危機、因此，他們夫婦的幾處就動搖了。</p>
<p>我們率直言之、夫婦是性關係的結合，他們幾處的所以動搖，以為性生活的不能美滿之故，照理，夫婦的相愛是互利的、相互受用的、何以而不能美滿？必為一方在性能上有病態所致·據醫學上的論斷，男子如於早年犯有自瀉遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱欲、或早婚多妻把生殖腺液消耗過多、則凡早洩陽痿、發育不全、精　不育、神經衰弱等癥即不一而足、此種丈夫、在夫婦生活上每感心餘力绌之苦，同時妻子的熱情、怎能經這冷淡的摧殘，有許多妻子的不感癥、子宮充血癥、歇斯底裡癥、以及神經衰弱等癥就由此而起、至在性情強悍者，二另尋出路，而與人私通私奔，而與夫訴請離婚者，在今日社會上亦司空見慣。</p>
<p>夫婦欲求永遠在愛得樂園中度幸福生活者，先決問題即為性能健康。所以聰明夫婦必小心保養、愛護倍至。若有上述癥象發生、必求最對癥而特效的療法。至對癥特此奧療法，據世界名醫之千萬病案，及余多年經驗，均以服生殖腺素製劑[生殖素]（分男女兩用）為最佳。因此劑品質貴重、效力準確、服後一小時藥力即開始、二十四小時男則生精補腎，女則調經止帶，繼續服用一週，則助長發育機能，旺盛新陳代謝，健腦活血，可將上述合癥完全治愈。長服更有收延年益壽返老還童之功，所以中西名醫均推崇此劑。惟男友遺精者，須兼服[希米脫氏固精片]（五洲中西中法等大藥房有售）、以直至遺洩，則標本兼治、收效尤速。</p>

<h3 id="c90">乳峯是茁長愛苗的原子 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>這不是過甚其詞，也不是侮辱女性，更不是自己輕薄。我們男子，因為女性的乳峯，誘惑力是在太大了。無論你怎樣老誠不阿的道學先生，可是當你旁晚向公園裡去溜達溜達的時候。看到血多裸臂裸腿的健美女郎、嘻嘻哈哈，打從你的前面走來。她們的衣服是這樣薄，曲綫是那麼地明顯，二尤其高聳著一對乳峯，更微微地一起一伏、似在向你點頭，你即使是個柳下惠吧，身臨此境，眼看此情，恐怕也要砰然心動呢？所以美國百特生一元魯與博士在最近出版的一部書名叫作『愛情之秘』的一書里，要說女子乳峯，是夫婦間的幸福之神，又說是茁長愛苗的原子，他認為女子的乳峯，如果愈高而愈有彈性，則其人的生殖腺卵巢機能必強盛，所以性情也愈加溫柔，熱情奔放，能夠予男子以飛漲的快慰，所謂『恰到好處』，因此家庭間無不充滿喜氣，幸福無量！反之，女性的乳峯，如鬆弛下垂，或竟萎　一如男子者，則可斷定其患不可告人的種種隱病外，兼患不感不妊癥。此等女子，在姿態上已失去美妙的曲綫，在夫婦生活上，更使男子味同嚼蠟，因其種種不良影響，結果遂演出許多悲劇！</p>
<p>然則乳峯萎　的女性，將怎樣以謀補救呢？此據世界著名婦科名醫康德林及余經驗。均公認以服卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』，最為對癥而特效。蓋此劑之成分，係由極壯健的動物內提取其卵巢精華，經科學方法配製而成。故藥性和平，功效偉大，倘繼續服用，不特可使萎　的乳峯，日形高聳，瘦削的臀部，漸見豐腴，且能調整月經，紅潤面頰，長駐青春。</p>
<h3 id="c91">遺精與腦弱失眠的關係 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫生詹念曾</p>
<p>遺精過頻會招致腦弱失眠癥，這在略具勝利常識的青年，想該誰都知道吧！同時一個青年如果因用腦過度，或因天熱，失戀，憂傷——等原因致夜間失眠者，亦最易患遺精癥。準此，在這天氣悶熱的黃聲季節，汗液的排泄不已，空氣潮濕，氣壓頗低，就每有夢遺的現象。要是素來來遺精者，不注意預防與治療，那沒有不使癥象惡化的。所以由遺精而招致滑精漏精者有之，由遺精而致腦，脊髓，性三大神經衰弱者，那更比比皆是。於是頭腦脹痛，健忘失眠，悲痛腰酸，腎萎早洩，精力渙散等種種癥象即相繼而來。此種青年不特志氣消沉，怕寒畏熱，將見其半身潦倒一事無成！同時因戀痛苦，就是憑媒妁之言，父母之命得與異性結為夫婦，在夫婦生活上亦必不能美滿，為妻憎恨，或竟子女無出，貽終生大憾！所以青年一有遺精，切不可等閒視之，在此黃霉季節，尤應注意預防，遺精的特效療法，據世界名醫及余經驗，均以服「希米脫氏固精片」以固精關，鎮靜神經，使夜得安眠、夢幻減少，則遺精可以當夜立止。如因遺精已有上述徵象者，須兼服用生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，能繼續服用，必可於短期內根治上述各癥，並更可保證治愈。</p>
<h3 id="c92">編餘贅言 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>日來雖然外匯暴縮，物價飛漲，客戶四真要老牌子得到萬人信仰的東西，總不肯利用萬機的。譬如國產捲烟業中的巨　——華成，南洋，他們所出品的捲烟，第一，非至萬不得已，不肯輕易增價，致加重老顧客的負擔。第二，不肯附送贈品，作偷工減料的掩飾，所以能夠久享盛名，始終不衰，這便是一個很好的例子。茲聞本埠安立思藥行所經理之『生殖素』『希米脫氏固精片』等各種著名良藥，因進貨極早，故亦抱定這兩個新年。適中不漲價，不送贈品，蓋公道自在人心，服後便見分曉，所以不作虛偽的宣傳云。</p>

<p>在花柳病中之易於傳染之疾患，無過於淋毒，同時在治療方面，其難治亦無過於淋毒，惟世人知其然而未明其所以然。夫淋毒既然本爲難治之病，則其對於淋毒之治療，尤不可不十二分之愼重。無奈患者往往私行服用市上充斥之成藥。或迷信一種拘執之局部醫械之手術。蓋淋病並非限於局部，症狀亦不一而定，如何拘執一種成藥，無異刻舟求劍，因藥只有一種而病則變化多端也。至於局部手術醫械療法，充其量亦僅作用於局部之功效。而實際上要想用醫械之洗滌方法，將淋菌擠之而出，無異痴人説夢，只有痴人信之而已。因爲淋毒侵淫到後尿道後，其生理上之構造甚爲複雜，淋菌到處可以存身，要想以單純之醫械，全部將淋菌赶出，尤其是不可能之事。</p>
<p>余十數年來之經驗，治療淋病，不拘成法，用針，用藥，用電療，用消息子，用按摩法等，均先憑科學的診斷法，明白病情所在後，作對症之治療，而余所用之療法，均取其極進歩者，如電療方法中，余獨取德國濾淋平流電法，血淸方面，余獨取德國希氏血淸。而內服藥方面，余獨採最新化學療法，蓋吾輩醫家之責任，惟有求病速治，既不可拘泥成法，又不必爭奇炫異，以病人作犧牲品也。</p>

<p>成績考核</p>
<p>教部先後頒佈之各省市實施播音教育辦法、及中等學校利用播音教育播音須知、民眾教育館利用教育播音須知、各省市教育廳局主辦電化教育行政人員注意要點、二十六年度各省市實施電化教育注意要點、對於各級工作人員之任務及成績考核、均有詳細之規定、教部及各省市督學視察員等、於視察各裝設收音之校館、亦均將收音成績、列為各該校館重要考成之一項、</p>
<p>劃定經費</p>
<p>教部在二十四年度內、開設辦理播音教育時、並無的款、僅在該部辦公費內擄節支付、二十五年度起、中央確定民眾建設經費後、始劃定三十萬元、專辦播音教育、二十六年度、列支十三萬五千元、內補助各省市收音機及乾電池占十二萬五千元、二十七年度七至十二月、則支四萬元、內補助各省市收音機及乾電池占三萬五千元、播音教育行政占五千元、在各省市教育廳局、亦會奉教育部令、劃定播音教育專款、各收音機關、並須於本機關事業費內、編列播音教育用費、惟以各省市縣籌款非易、尚未能達到事業所要求之經費數目、</p>

<h3 id="c96">怎樣指導兒童的假期生活 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 盧冠六</p>
<p>俗語說、「學到老、學不了」、可見我們求知識、本來不限定相當的地方、也不限定相當的時期、我們不能說學校是求知的地方、家庭中、社會上就不是求知的地方、我們也不能說學期里是求學的時期、休息日、假期中便不是求學的時期、所以我們要隨時隨地指導兒童去學習新事物、求得新知識、但根據了這個原則、可以知道就是放了暑假、也並不是說給兒童純粹休息不必求知的時期、不過表示因為天時的關係、他們求知的方法、活動的事項、要改變另一個方法罷了、</p>
<p>兒童在假期中求知的方法、活動的事項、究竟是怎樣的改變呢、那可以分成做三項來說、第一是知識活動方面、這就是說要改變上課的形式、採用自學的方法、支配了自習的假期作業給兒童去做、使兒童從功課的溫習中、去獲得新知、第二是公民活動方面、這就是說要兒童從狹小的學校生活改成廣闊的社會生活、就兒童的能力所及、利用假期的餘閑、去參加適當的社會工作、第三是健康活動方面、這就是說要在假期中減輕兒童功課的負擔、注重身體的鍛煉、注意衛生、減少疾病的侵入、注意運動、增進體格的健康、</p>
<p>普通的學校里、以為到了假期、只要支配些假期作業給兒童去做、便以為盡了能事、實在這還是不夠的、因為放了暑假、兒童的生活方式已和平時不同、做教師的要怎樣指導他們去過這長期的假期生活、況且暑假里既非安心讀書的時候、他們離開學校、回到家庭、更多和社會接觸的機會、所以便應得指導他們做些社會活動的工作、使兒童從這工作中去了解社會、學習社會、其次便是關於健康方面、暑期本來是最不衛生的時候、因為天氣的炎熱、蚊蠅的繁殖、常常容易使人生病、所以愈是到了夏天、愈應注重衛生、這樣才可以保持健康、所以在暑假里、健康活動和社會活動的工作、比知識活動的工作、覺得更有價值、更有意義、更值得我們起來提倡和指導、</p>
<p>關於社會活動方面、有下列的幾項工作、可以指導去做、</p>
<p>（一）組織讀書會、聯絡附近同學、互相討論、互求進步、</p>
<p>（二）推行小先生、幹些普及教育的工作、教自己家裡或親戚鄰居的不識字的人、</p>
<p>（三）討論時事問題、用集體的方法、有系統的有計劃的研究時事知識、</p>
<p>（四）出版里弄壁報、或坐廣播活報、增進一般人的見識、引起一般人的研究、</p>
<p>（五）實行撲滅蚊蠅工作、注意附近的公共衛生、做些防疫運動的工作、</p>
<p>（六）宣傳節約救難、喚起一般人對於節約的認識。積極起來實行節約的工作。</p>
<p>關於健康活動方面、也有下列的幾項工作、可以指導兒童去做、</p>
<p>（一）每晨早操十分鐘、（二）每星期做幾個遊戲、（三）每星期出外散步幾次、（四）要天天洗澡、（五）襯衣間的工作、（六）每日飲食有定量、（七）每日睡眠有定時、</p>
<p>上面的幾項工作、如果能夠指導兒童去做、那末兒童的假期生活、才能有圓滿的結果了、</p>

<p>科學在吾國未能充分發達者其原因甚多。而吾國人對於科學本身之認識不清，乃其最大原因之一也。吾人凡作一事，恒思得一捷徑，尋一秘訣，以為坐收成功，一勞永逸之計。其治學術也亦不免此心理也。七八十年以前，吾國人已知科學之重要，政府頗思提倡之。當時國內有志科學之研求者，亦不乏人。唯其對此種工作所認識者，乃科學之一端，而非其全體。如數學為博大精深之學術，其在科學位置之重要，及宜在國內加意提倡，因毫無疑義。然只知注重此學，置各種科學於不顧，以為此學為一切科學之母，倘能深明數理，則一切科學問題皆可迎刃而解，亦未免有過偏之弊。昔日上海之格致書院，原以造就科學人才為目的，肄業其中者，又多一時英俊，而皆趨於數學之一途，物理，化學，等門未暇攻討，生物地質等門更視為等閒。聞該院購置理化等學之儀器，連楹充棟，卒無所用，聽其霉朽。諸生專攻數學，以為此學一旦深通，所有儀器概可利用，以為解決一切科學問題之具矣。究之其中嘗有一二人在數學上似稍有造詣，而於其他之各門科學仍懵然一無所省。數學意外之科學，因不為人所注意，竟毫無萌芽茁生之望。以上所言，不過其一例。數十年來，吾國之提倡科學，研求科學，發生類此至錯誤者，不知凡幾。科學之本身，乃一健全之有機物，其中各門，皆不可缺，始可收彼此相助之功。各門科學，皆必同等重視，科學有全體之發達，激盪淬勵，輔助觀摩，實用之科學遂日益進步，造福民生，為國家社會解除無限之困難。願國內提倡科學教育者，注重及此焉。</p>
<h3 id="c109">食物與營養 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— 心織</p>
<p>往古哲學家對於食物及營養之需要，曾加以考慮。惟營養知識之進步，亦如其他科學，先由實驗入手，得寸則寸，得尺則尺，逐漸擴展，乃能理得頭緒。考其實驗之時代，實始於百年前。在此短時期之百年中，能由完全黑暗，進而逐漸見光明，誠屬科學上之大成就也。</p>
<p>距今二千三百餘年前，希臘人希卜開帝為西方醫學之祖，曾以為一切食物均含有一種普遍之滋養質。即調食物雖萬殊，而滋養質則僅一種而已。至十九世紀初葉，馬近悌始取各種食物喂飼動物以為試驗。但限於不含氮質之食物如糖膠之類。其試驗方法之精密，頗是嚴迪後進。其能辨別含氮與不含氮食物之功效，實立近世生理學與生物化學之基礎。數年後，幕爾寶明辨動植物之體素中各種蛋白物質之相似點，定其名曰「潑洛丁」至今認為體素中主要之有機質。合以李別虛之成就於食物化學之知識增進不少。賴福謝及范德研究人身所需之能量亦皆有功足錄者也。至十九世紀之末，美國農部之公告中，曾有營養值條件：列舉食物之化學成份，營養分之比例，消化之難易，燃料值之比較，營養與價格之關係，各職業界中忍所需最宜之食物，與營養值比例等等。</p>
<p>研究營養問題之專家，致力於說明人類對於各種食物之經驗者，亦有年矣。然社會對於科學家所創之營養論尚屬藐視者，大都因人各有其食物之經驗。多數以為選擇適宜食物之方法，純恃胃口與經濟能力為準則，已是以應付矣。惟經動物餵養試驗之後，確知有數種營養失調之病癥，可由食物試驗而得之。此種失調之病，無異於尋常之病癥，故不易明其主因。自應用食物性質之知識於病癥之研究，得知錯誤之食物，實為身體虛弱及早夭之根源。注意於食物之調養，可使病者健康，健康者長生，信不可誣也。</p>
<p>研究營養之進步史，實為百年來數十百人深思詳驗之結果，其目的不外求知人體營養之必要及食物之性質。其中最重要之一節，為微太敏之發明。微太敏有時譯音作維他命，有時譯作維生素或命素。　改譯為微太敏，雖屬譯音，同時亦表其在食物中量雖極微，而用則甚驗敏也。若調為維持生命之安素，則不值此類物質而已，一切食物皆為維持生命值要素也。況以嚴格言，微太敏在化學上並非屬於同一類物質，初以知識幼稚，不明其性質，總名曰微太敏，亦猶之代數中之XY為未知數之代表及某甲某乙在小說中代表不著姓名之人而已。</p>
<h3 id="c110">飮酒如何為害健康 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 魯易</p>
<p>飲酒中毒可分急性和慢性的二類。所謂酒醉即是急性中毒。說是由於酒有興奮性，但實際上酒并不是一種興奮劑，它能使平時限制個人行為的一部份腦中酒毒而失其自製力。</p>
<p>腦既失其自製力，於是思想遂得離開平時的理智和謹慎心而自由活動，所以一個醉漢常粗魯多話，高聲怪笑，以及做出種種不正常的行為。酩酊大醉的人，更會神思恍惚，甚至昏迷不省人事。在這過飲的狀態下，因此行路蹣跚，言語難混，面部泛紅，脈搏急劇，兩目發赤，腦中血液增加而是人眩暈。嘔吐也是一種普通癥候。</p>
<p>酒有局部刺激力，尤其在胃。它能使胃的內壁發生紅腫，形成輕微潰瘍。長期飲酒的人，其胃內必起嚴重的病理變化。吞飲酒精成份極高的酒類，如高粱原酒，必覺腹中發燒，即是酒精在胃內起局部作用的指示。</p>
<p>胃臟通常不吸收食物，而對於酒精是一個例外，極易吸收，所以中毒極速。凡欲持久免醉者，切不可空腹飲酒，因為空腹比飽食時吸收酒精更快。</p>
<p>在暢飲之時或以前，最佳的食物是脂肪食物。酒精是脂肪的優良溶劑，所以二者有特殊的親和力。碳水化合物（糖，蜜餞，甜食）是佐酒最不好的食品。在化學上說，碳水化合物即是酒精的一種變相。所以一切甜酒均不宜飲用。</p>
<p>因為酒醉是一種極平常之事，所以人們很少想到更嚴重的一種慢性酒毒。若不斷地飲酒，以致發生年久的酒毒，身體內比起顯著的變化。有幾種很厲害，竟至破壞生理上的正常機能而致死亡。第一種必然的變化在消化管。酒精作用如一種局部刺激毒劑，因為發生消化不良，食慾減退，和慢性的卡他性咳嗽，即是所謂酒咳。</p>
<p>赤鼻是慢性酒毒的標識，道赤色標識血管的受審。酒精作用於血管壁上能使它們變性。管壁既變弱，血管乃脹大；鼻和面頰表皮上的小血管容許更多的血進入，因此使道二部分發赤。任何　及血管的毒必使與玄關聯繫的內臟受到相應的損害。</p>
<p>因此之故，凡受久年慢性酒毒之人，他的一切重要器官均難免受審，而以腎臟受毒最早。</p>
<p>血的供給既有變更，酒精對於肌肉乃發揮其潛伏的危害力。受害人的隨意肌（我們能控制的肌）因脂肪變性而部份的破損，因此某機組肌肉呈麻痹的徵候，而全身肌肉　顯示不相合的慘狀。</p>
<p>若飲量甚少而能被身體完全氧化，酒是很像一種食物。因為它能產生能力，又是竟有人謬稱它做食物。但飲之過分，酒是絕對有毒。所以倘使文明人必需行觴取樂，惟有以教育的力量來指導他們飲不過量，所謂「惟酒無量不及亂」，就是我們的古訓。</p>

<p>革命（Revolution）現象見諸人事者甚多，如政治革命，社會革命，經濟革命，甚至家庭革命，心理革命等等。凡人類中藥改革，皆可以革命名之。然此皆其小焉者，不是語於大革命。所謂最大革命，唯地球足以當之。地球有罪劇烈之變動約四次，謂之四大革命。其餘所經之變邊，不足與之比埒。此四次之大革命，皆因地球內博溶質或漲或縮，地殼遂不免上凸與下凹。此種變動過劇，於是高山突起，巨壑下沉，冰河橫流，氣候陡變，地面上一切山脈河流及所有值生物，皆受極大之影響。如化石中之三葉蟲，古昆蟲，古員類，甲魚，古兩栖類，巨大之爬蟲（如各種恐龍，飛龍，魚龍等）原始鳥類，巨大哺乳類，大多在一大革命時期喪失生命，竟至絕種。現在世界上所有之生物皆有幸免於絕滅，或因大革命之威脅而進化，以至於今日之程度。此四大革命，第一次發現於古生代之塞武紀（Oambrlan）初期，距今約一萬萬年以前。第三次出現於中生代與新生代之交，此次變動視前二次稍遜，距今約在六千萬年以前。第四次出現於新生代之後新期，（Pleistocene）距今約在一百餘萬年以前，遠遜於此四者，故不足謂之革命。然來日方長將來仍有大革命之出現乎？世界所有生物（連人類在內）將有一大部份囚之絕滅，另有新者出而代之乎？是亦不可知者矣·或者科學日益發達，人類當能利用之以避免絕種之慘禍也。</p>

<h3 id="c112">桃色的話 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 橋下客</p>
<p>「暮春三月，江南草長，雜花生樹，草鶯亂飛，睹故國之旗鼓，感平生於疇昔」，這幾句文章，不知怎地現在有一部份人讀來彌覺感慨系之。於是引出桃色的話。</p>
<p>西方有幾位學者，把人生一切的現象都歸納到男女兩性的關係上去；這也許過分一點。當然，我們不能否認，生物界中的性工作——繁殖——是生命上最重要的一部份，我們人類也不能例外。但是有文字的地方，無端的造出一個「愛」字，這樣一個普通的字，有時還穿上神秘的大衣，到底是怎樣一回事。假如我們說：愛國愛鄉，是表示需要一種適宜的環境；愛書畫愛古董，是表示需要一種研究的對象；愛親知愛朋友，是表示一種同情。那麼，不妨說愛就是需要。或者問，假使有人需要愛，這又如何注解呢？有何難哉，他就是需要一種需要；毫無需要的人是不能設想的。或者又問，人們都需要吃飯，但是人們都不覺得怎樣愛飯，恐怕說不通罷？哦，何其涉也。假使閣下三天不吃，我想，不免要擠緊肚皮喊道「飯呀，我願為你犧牲一切」。所以「一矮三峽暮，餘後見君情」，是知交死後才感動的，「天涯風俗自相親」是辭鄉之後才領略到的，皆一類也。這一些愛的例子，都說不上神秘。現在來了男女之愛，不妨說她是男女之間的需要，不過得分成兩種：一為社會組織上的，如管理家務，內外分工，二為生物通例上的，是完成性交。第一種需要與愛親知愛朋友並無原則上的區別，第二種需要是男女間所獨有的，於是問題就此發生。色欲最好以食慾為例，飢餓的時候就要吃，不辭以任何方法達之，吃飽了完事，誰於飽後還捧住一碗飯讚嘆徘徊，那是天下之第一情人也。當然，整個經過的時間彼此不一致的。（未完）</p>

<p>洋商工廠·行家，進了一批原料，要解貨款，必須結買外匯，但是原料一時換不到錢，缺少鈔票頭寸，不得不託本國銀行出面，收取信用存款，近期賤價抛出，遠期高價收進，利息二三分錢，期以一月爲限，蓋因靑黃不接，不得不飮鴆止渴，而一般富商財閥，貪蠅頭之利，不惜爲虎作倀，代人作嫁。所謂「利之所在，趨之若騖。」</p>
<p>旬前：匯市慘變，先令驟縮，由八辦士二五掛牌軟至六辦士半，成本加起兩成，人心恐慌，洋行猛力吸收，加之，月底將屆，需款孔亟，利錢出至五分半錢，果然，「重賞之下，必有勇夫」，兩三日內之洋商銀行，收進是項存款；達八九百萬元，均當日雙方成立契的，月底交割（解款也），美金起碼五千元（合法幣四萬餘元），多至二萬五千元，五萬元亦有之。但各地富戶，集中孤島，渾渾噩噩，正苦無從投資，今聞此消息，無不爭先恐後，踴躍捐輸，故兩三日間，此鉅大數字，即吿滿額。資本家祇知「利己」，不知有國計民生，擾亂金融。不料財政部二十一日馬電指示，限制提取存款，不啻晴天霹靂，除了池魚之殃的正常工商業，爲了鈔票頭寸的缺乏，生意淸淡，賣買停頓，受了無名損失外。那套外匯利息的朋友，本來想混水裹捉魚，不料事出意外，銀行裹整筆存款提不出（五百元爲限），而洋商方面，訂立的契的，有保人，掮客，不怕你少，到了期要如數照解，這兩天，正也急得走頭無路，入地無門。結果，祇好抬價拋出，譬如從前兩分錢拋進，現在抬價三四分錢讓出，訂了張契的，一轉手問，損失幾千幾萬，正大有人在，那眞所謂「自扳石頭壓脚面，賠了夫人又折兵」了！</p>
<p>所以：希望套外匯利息的資本家，受了此决嚴重打擊，也可以醒醒了。與其如供人利用，而又折本勾當，倒不如把這些金錢，投資到木國實業廠家，一方面，旣可振興實業，福國利民，同時，自己資金的利息，也有了穩固的保障，吾則，一味祇知道鋌而走險，投機取巧，結果，却白白損失了銀子，「偷鷄不着蝕把米」，這又何苦呢！</p>

<p>— 楊晋豪</p>
<p>一個時代的文章，是表達一個時代的精　的，文章的內容（見解）和形式（語調），應該符合時代精：這已經成為常識了。</p>
<p>可是，吾國今日所流行的文章，仍有許多運這樣的常識都還沒有做到。是做着現代的人，有的卻偏偏耍用古文來寫古人的見解，有的却把今人的見解用古文來寫，有的却用今文來寫古人的見解。第一種等於行屍走肉，第二種等於現代的活鬼，第二種等於木乃伊的喬裝打扮：都配不上稱為真正的「今文」——新時代的文章。</p>
<p>目前允其流行的是第二種文章；有着現代的　魂，却去做活鬼，使人捉摸不淸，這眞中　已奚落自已。</p>
<p>不過，他們光是奚落自己，倒也罷了：却偏偏還在這社會上佔了相當地位，讓一班生氣蓬勃的後生小子，不得不費掉許多精力，去捉摸那些鬼形鬼影，甚至還要追隨着他們也去作那鬼聲鬼氣。那作孽可真不小了！</p>
<p>為求節省些文化青年們的精力，勿使化在冤枉路中，而用到更加深遠的造詣上去；同時，也為讓那些沒有多錢去學那古腔古調的大衆，也能够求得知識，也能够抒發情意：我要請求大人先生們大家來革除古文遣孽，擴大今文運動：</p>
<p>（一）大中學校的人學考試，一律限用今文寫：就是要用現代語來寫現代的見解。有的大學或高中的國文出題先生，儘搬些四書五經是的老古董，甚至閱卷先生只看文言試卷，不看白話試卷，像這樣強迫青年學生　倒車的習氣，非竭力　除不可！</p>
<p>（二）所有往來公文，無論呈·咨·令·批，尤其是政府機關的佈吿·命令……等，應該廢除各種官塲老調，一律改用白話寫。</p>
<p>（三）一切社會上的應用文，無論書信·契的·廣吿·柬帖·……等，應該廢除各種因襲俗套，完全改用白話寫。</p>
<p>（四）報紙雜誌上的新聞·文章……更當用白話寫，以為提倡，以便普及。</p>
<p>有些人說，寫文言經濟。其實這不一定。譬如有一則電訊說：「……此問認為天津事件之和平解決希望，甚為微薄……改做白話，可寫為；「這裏認為要和平解決天津事件的希望很少」，不是也可以省一個字嗎？有許多無病呻吟，或是滿紙老套的新古董，看他搖頭擺尾，說不出一點道理來，那扌是不經濟極了！所以，文章的經濟不經濟，要看它內容是吾充實，說話是吾嚕囌而定。並且，用白話寫，在作者可以少費一番學作古文的準備功夫，和寫時把白話譯成文言的功夫；在讀者也可以少費一番學讀古文的功夫，和讀時把文言譯成白話的功夫，那不是比寫文言要經濟得多嗎？「文淡定革命」，鼓吹了二多年，而仍有不少靑年學生要求　古文，學文言；而吾國的敎育也至今不會眞正普及；這完全是因為社會上所流行的新古董——文言——在作祟。所以我要求敎育主管，政府要員，和各界領袖，應當早一點明令或者倡導寫今文。使那些新古董在社會上失掉了根據，那未，符合時代精神的今文自然曾抬頭而普及，「文學革命」和「革命文學」自然會取得更進一步的勝利。</p>
<p>以上雖然老話重提，但是至今值得）聲疾呼。希望大家「旣知必行」，踏　地來幹一下</p>

<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>——戰地追記——</p>
<p>商城入皖，有兩路可通：一由魚子店至揮旗山，過四道河二十里，即為皖境，這是比較平坦的大路；另一路由絲爪墩至蘇仙石，越黃土嶺而達皂靴河，此為最近的捷徑，但道路盤曲，山坡陡斜，非步行不辦。我們從宋埠到商城，已經晚間九時光景，雖然有兵監部的卡車代步。但每經山水匯積的廣大石灘，仍須下車涉水而渡，要不然，車輪跟亂石開起玩笑來，準會使你舉行「下水典禮典禮」的。當晚，我們投宿於縣府隔璧的大華飯店，在商城城中，算是首屈一指的旅館，紙糊的窗門，凹凸的泥地，破舊的竹榻，無一不保存着中古時代的作風。然而物質條件的低劣，正可以反映出社會生活的樸素來：中州人民的堅苦耐勞，於此可燭其微了。而且民性强悍，自經這决的組織，訓練，以及政治常識的灌輸，在「保衛我們的家鄕」聲中，都是糜拳擦掌，準備着揮洒他們的熱血。</p>
<p>安徽省委章乃器先生，那天也留宿商城；道位並不陌生的民族鬥士，從武漢回皖，道經這里，所以就遇見了。他穿了一套破舊的灰布制服，在院子裏踱來踱去，誰也不知道他是現任的高級官吏。</p>
<p>「啊，上那兒去？」他似乎有點詫異。</p>
<p>「安徽。」我答道，「皖西去！」隨即加上一句。</p>
<p>「那麼一塊兒同行了？」</p>
<p>「不，我們也許要往信陽考察一下。」</p>
<p>於是，他吿訴我們這里民衆動員工作的狀况，表示着非常滿意的興奮，落後，他說入皖的一百五十里山路，只有借重一雙脚，因為皖西鹽米兩缺，不能不動員民伕，以作未雨的綢繆，所以僱轎就絕對沒辦法。</p>
<p>不知怎的，縣長陳守常先生居然發現了章先生的來臨，在明天的一淸早，就到大華來請他去演講，我們也連　地被的了·及至演講完畢，我們在全城巡禮一周。這座河南邊境的古老縣城，周圍不滿十里，因為地處戰區，街市顯得非常沉寂：但民衆對於抗戰的情緒，却極為緊張，由於演講會中所得的印象，常然可以證明的。據說：河南光州的舊屬六縣，因連年鬧者匪惠，民間的防禦工作，向來就做得很好，保甲制度，也相當完密，將來流動戰一開始，商城的民間武力，便立刻會發揮出來，用以担當着皖西的門衛，那是綽乎有餘的。證以商城陷落，已有半年之久，而織騎終於沒有越過皂靴河一步，雖憑天險，亦賴人力，誰說政治工作不重要呢？</p>

<p>— 沙鴻譯</p>
<p>從前學習飛行，一定要在空中，現在只要在地上一架小型機裹，就能學習操縱方法而得到飛行的正確感覺。這應該感謝一位紐的靑年愛德林克所發明的一種新術。</p>
<p>林克練習器是裝在一間緊壓空氣室中，而用强有力的風箱控制着的，除了不能飛以外，樣樣能及得上一架眞飛機，且能利用自動器設備，正確摹倣飛行中的種種危險；——像機翼結冰，空氣阻逆等，也會像在一架飛機裹一樣的迷失了高度，或是飛入旋風圈。一個不謹愼的學習者，加果關在這練習器中時候太久，也會像一個精練的機師，在空氣中過久而發生頭暈，降地時耍仗着別人的扶助扌能出機。</p>
<p>公衆對於林克練習器曉得的太少，但是在美國航空貿易局和海陸軍方面，都認為標準的設備。陸軍中現在巳備此器二十五具。歐美商業航空也用這種練習器訓練他們的機師，實習飛行，並使他們隨時受危險的試騐。</p>
<p>林克的第一架練習器，是在他父親的風琴製造廠的一個角落裏造成的，他採用風琴的風箱設備所用的空氣方法。現在他在紐的州的賓漢頓，和加拿大安大略省的甘那諾克的兩處廠裏製造這器。本年一月，他因為世界各處紛紛向他定購，便將他賓漢頓廠的生產力擴大到四倍。加拿大一廠，現在正替不列顚帝國各處顧客趕造共値一百二十五萬美金的定貨。這種訓練器，最便宜的每架美金六千元，最貴的每架一萬元。林克今年扌三十五歲，家產已將近百萬之多。這位發明家沒有在學校裹受過技術訓練，他的經騐是從自已工塲裏細心得來的。風琴的製造和大多數工業製造不同；牠根據的力量是緊壓的空氣。林克從孩子時代就專心研究這種力量。</p>
<p>他二十三歲時，便在林白飛至巴黎所引起的航空在中，從事航空。不久，他就敎人飛行。但飛行在學生方面也許是認為一件緊張的事，而在敎師方面，這樁事會很快地變成一種慣例。像林克這樣一個忙人，天天從事於此，很以為苦，因此他便想出一種方法，在地面上可養成飛行的經騐。他消耗了一九二七年至一九二八年之間的冬季光陰，在風琴廠裹實　風箱，通風孔，以及空氣的支持力量。到了春季，他竟將這問題解決了。他能造成一架訓練器，一切運動像一架眞的飛機一樣。林克於是便創辦了一所航空學校，來學的只要答應付學費八十五元便能祖保他畢業。一九三一年，這校裹有學生一百五十人，可是一九三二年，他感覺沮喪了，因為學生、數逐漸减少，以致學校發見虧蝕。</p>
<p>同時他　去的訓練器，其數也不足維持他的計畫：只有航空運輸機關買幾架，銷於外國的為數也寥寥：英國也只有幾架，其餘的銷在歐洲其他各處。一九三〇年，海軍方面購去一架，陸軍訂購了六架。</p>
<p>他主嬰的收入，倒還是來自各娛榮公園；他和他兄弟喬治，用練習器在公園中作種種航空表演。有一决，喬治受了觀衆的窘。原來他們要爬進機座來開動機件。林克就提出一個辦法，請觀衆各出金錢以為報酬，然後乘這練習器「飛行」　一刻鐘。觀衆果然解囊，輪流試乘了一回，滿意而散，此後這表演塲就定了參觀　，每天售票收入，很為可觀，於是他的工廠就得維持下去，而日見發展。</p>
<p>一九三叫年，航空郵遞台同的取消，以及試　陸軍航空部隊駕駛載郵飛機遭遇的禍事，使航界覺悟機械訓練的需要，——這却是刻不容緩之圖。於是林克的機會到了，隔日向他探問練習器用法的，絡繹不絕。自從一九三四年年終起，他廠裏的生產就日見增加。</p>
<p>常你進了一架林克練習器的時候，你可認為自己已身在一架眞的飛機裏一樣。常你「升起的時候，機件明晣地表明正和上升的一飛機所表明的一樣。　飛機一到空中，就須辦時高度，而古飛前進，身處空氣之中，並不安穩。在　習器中也有這種種感覺，除了不能前進外，飛行的一切驚恐情能，練習器都能實現出來。假使有一隻機翼下垂，駕駛人立刻就會覺到，還有人造水準器也會提醒駕駛人。他如增减高度，左右旋轉，無不應有盡有。</p>
<h3 id="c132">無言之痛 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— 李韶年</p>
<p>偶而閒着，就去找一個朋友談談。因為同是年靑的文藝愛好者，所以在相見之下，所談的總脫不了文藝，接着便針對目前孤島的慘淡的景象發了一通妄論。坐了一會，我在他的書架上取下一本魯彥的「旅人的心」之後，就辭出了。取這本書的動機，無非我也是一個旅人吧。我正要看看所謂「旅人」的心是怎樣的，彼此是吾有着同一的情感給貫穿淸心境。</p>
<p>回家。我翻淸「旅人的心」。在這上面却發現了朋友的讀後感，是八行的詩；標題用着「無言之痛」四字：</p>
<p>白紙上晝有小小的圈，</p>
<p>你能遁出對故鄕的思念嗎？</p>
<p>旅人的心呀！</p>
<p>跌在痛苦的小圈裏了，</p>
<p>企望一切慰藉來臨，</p>
<p>你仰頭守候，</p>
<p>苦塞的旅人的心，</p>
<p>但求放大那生命的光圈！</p>
<p>我的朋友將他自身的懷鄕症流露在這八行中間而無法掩飾了。</p>
<p>但是故鄕呢？</p>
<p>在砲火的下面，故鄕——他的和我的，除僅存一類似亂石崗式的地坪而外，就祇有碎瓦斷磚的刧餘。想着了這，懷鄕的症狀，自然是愈加沉重，有時不得不寄一些無言的痛苦在字行中間，聊以舒懷，然而沈痛還是依然。</p>
<p>其實，他是缺乏了堅定的「信念」的，吾則決不會讓無言之痛滋長在心裏，嚙傷了他：要是這樣發展下去，他是會沈沒在最嚴重的精神病裏的，永遠不能自拔：直截的說來，他正在從事於慢性的自殺呢。</p>
<p>「最後勝利是屬於我們的！」我們拋棄這無首之痛而作無言的希望和努力，才能放大那生命的光圈；不是嗎？蔣總裁昭吿着我們：「一人之生命有限，民族之生命無窮！」我們還要放大更大的光圈呢。（義賣獻金）</p>

<h3 id="c134">限制提存以後 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 張鎮山</p>
<p>馬電，好像是一陣不及掩耳的迅雷，伸展到上海以後，把投機者的野心震得發抖；把希冀逃避資金者的幻想擊得粉碎；而同時，使囤積居寄，操縱物價者，也變成了無用武之地的「英雄」；使一般生活程度得以穩定抑低的希望。我們再額手稱慶之餘，對那班「腹大野心」者，真可笑著臉袖手而觀其窘狀吧？</p>
<p>在限制提存以後，巨額存款者固無法施其無限制提取，然而這幾天銀行的提款者，大額的小額的戶頭，都非常擁擠。我曾走了幾家大銀行，在儲蓄部瀏覽着，每一家，圍擁的人　，一層一層的蠕動在那柜外的窗口下，揚着存摺或單據，那樣子，就好像是戲院裏開演好戲時的售票情形；櫃內職員也好像售票員那麼地忙碌。雷電的風，呼呼地刮着，還是驅逐不了熱浪；沖散不了人群中擠出來的汗酸臭；這盛況，的確是空前的，有幾家的儲蓄部還臨時添設窗洞，增調職員來應付，鈔票一捲捲的，由窗口中塞出來，有數十元的，有一二百元的，而五百元的也很多。聚沙成塔，其總纂的數字，一定是相當巨大的。</p>
<p>限制提存的辦法，本來規定伍佰元以下是不限制的。可是，那些小額存戶爲什麽也要趁趁熱鬧呢？這也許應該歸功於謠言吧？興風作浪的人們是無孔不入的，一遇有機會，必不肯停止運用其「口才」，再加上外商銀行不受部令拘束，對於存戶可付如額現鈔。因此，使一般人士不足的小資階級就產生了轉移的念頭。這幾天的提存者，如果說吧錢拿出去維持生活，真無人肯信。</p>
<p>而同時，那些小額存款的人，實際上却並不是純粹小額的，正有不少是由巨額搖身而變的，這已是公開的秘密。在前年「八一六」安定金融辦法公佈後，道現在已近兩年，他們的資金差不多都已逃出了限制範圍而變為現幣戶了。又因為有小額不受限額及提取較易的經驗，正有不少富翁把巨額自己，分割成若干小額，化立許多戶名，例如：張三，李思，趙五，孫六，周七，王八；還有什麽天記，地記，人記，鬼記，等等名稱，往來，仿佛狡兔有三　似的。所以，限制提存的辦法，雖然以伍佰元為度，而他們每週却不知道能夠提到若干個伍佰元，祗要戶名多，實不難全部變成現幣了。</p>
<p>然而，他們這累累現幣提出來，又安放道哪裏去呢？「聰明」者自有辦法，真毋庸顧慮着漫藏誨盜的危險。除了轉存現幣的戶頭外，多數是套買外匯存儲於外商銀行，有的更積極購黃白物（金銀），或設法囤積貨物。</p>
<p>此外，利用保管箱呆藏的也多，在儲蓄或往來部取出來，一面就放到自己在原銀行所租的保管箱中去，等到需要運用時，就取出來，真是便利之至。</p>
<p>這些自私自利的做作，所給予幣制及社會金融機構的破壞影響，真是相當巨大的，而一般純粹小額存戶聽信投機者的謠言，更為可慨！一般有資力的野心者，或自私者，都以民族，社會利害為先提，來輔助政府穩定金融，穩定市面，以增加經濟的抗戰力量。——這話明知等於「對牛彈琴」，然而，我們却不願緘口不言，效果有無，當然亦不暇顧及。</p>
<h3 id="c135">寫在「勞作展覽會」開幕之前 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>

<p>「自立性的教育即時所謂勞作教育」　研究和創造適應「為學致用」的目的</p>
<p>本市私校聯誼會發起的中小學勞作展覽會，已定於七月四日開幕，聽說規模很大，並且經作品義賣以作救難捐款。這種負有重大意義的「勞展」，實在是孤島教育界以前所未曾有過的。</p>
<p>讀書人手足不靈，勞動者不知思想，手腦不肯並用的壞習慣，確是我國生產落後的原因之一。自從二十三年振幅倡導勞作教育以來，成績優異的固屬不少，但是每星期添上一二小時土木竹紙之類的手工課程，作為點綴恐怕也不在少數。甚至喲少數學校，遇到展覽會，不得不利用機會，希冀博得人家讚賞爭些面子，而不惜代價購幾件現成的東西加以改頭換面後陳列出來。這種拿不出真價實貨而出之虛偽的造作，實在是教育界的不幸。爲了教育的價值和勞作的本旨着想，希望參加這次中小學勞作展覽會的學校，必須實事求是，不要以為社會是可以蒙蔽的。</p>
<p>某名教育家曾經說過：「自立性的教育即四所謂勞作教育」。因為如其能夠善用我們聰明的頭腦和萬能的雙手，來製造出一種東西，祗要牠是合於人類所需要的，那末從國家講，就不需要仰賴船來品而把資金外溢；從個人講，具有一技之長，也就不致做社會的寄生蟲，或遭遇到生活上可能的困難。</p>
<p>勞作教育在學校過的主要目的，是在漸進地成學生對於機械工業底興趣和技術；同時勞作教育也能夠充分發揚民族精神，我前年曾見到中小學勞作展覽會中一部份作品，是富有「收復失地」和「中國人愛國」的意思，這當然是很能激發民族意識的，看後令人興奮。</p>
<p>預料這次中小學生把精心的作品展覽出來，一定是極有意義的，極有價值的，但是不要即以此認為滿足，要深刻認識我國經過抗戰後復興大業，關於一切建設方面，端賴專門技術的人才，因此一方面要充實理科數學，和製造有關的圖案畫等知識，一方面要適應「為學致用」的目的，善用手腦不斷研究創造和發明。</p>
<p>最後希望社會士女，在「勞作展覽會」開幕的幾天，踴躍前去觀摩欣賞，和忠實的批評，同時更希望能慷慨解囊，購些心愛的東西。那末受難的同胞們，也受惠不淺哩。</p>

<p>第十三回　勸學務農儲材爲國　留强汰弱選種有場</p>
<p>何雙玉道：「那末這個蠶種場，就破了自由何不設工廠的計劃了。」朱付長道：「雖然當時大家有這個默契，也並沒有定出一個規則來，說是自由村不許設立工廠，因為當時也沒人想到自由村來相爭地勢，要在這裏設工廠。而自由村的人，也都是務農為業的，也沒人想到設立工廠的事。及至省裏農業局派了人來，和我們村裏相商，我們村裏就開了各會議，覺得這不能拒絕他。自由村只許自由村裏幾個人住，便不許人家來創業嗎？這種閉關自守的心理，這個世界還許存在嗎？況且　種場也沒有什麽妨害我們處，農業局也是為發展蠶業計，良好的種子，有利於養蠶人家。記得當初我們江蘇省得養蠶區淪陷的時候哦，蠶種差不多操縱在人家手裏。直到如今，江浙兩聲的蠶種，方始逐漸優良起來。還有一說：製種場也不餓能算一個純粹的工廠，它還是農業場的事，當時便議決答應了。好在他們占地不多，也不必定要水陸交通的地方。去年出的種子，成績良好，今年便添了一倍。誰知一倍還不夠，據說定下來的明年種子，已超過了今年所出的一倍有半。這樣，他們的房屋又不敷，已在那裏添造了。」何　玉道：「製種場大概只忙在養蠶一時吧？過了養蠶的時節，就要空閒下來、像現在的時候，就是空閒時候了。」朱付長道：「那也不一定。在從前原是如此，農家有一定的農曆，只要忙過一個初夏，蠶事便了。古人詩句所說得：「繞了蠶桑又插田，」恰好挨著了次序，忙過了　　，又忙到了中天。不過現在的養蠶，他們養了春蠶，又養了夏蠶；養了夏蠶，又洋秋蠶。除了冬天，桑葉不枯零以外，其餘三季，都可以養蠶的。為了三季都可以養蠶，所以製種場就要預備三季的蠶種，因此他們還是不大空閒的。不過夏蠶秋蠶，總沒有春蠶養得多。就像我們村裏，只養春蠶，共他們兩季的蠶，都不養的。而且除了養蠶飼桑以外，別的工作也正多。選種這一部份，便有好多人咧。都要死專門的人，都要是蠶業學校畢過業的。這些工作却都是女士們所做的呀！」（一四八）</p>

<p>是廢物交易廢物的運動　家庭應用物品樣樣都有</p>
<p>最近上海生活程度之增高，身世前所未見，房租固然不必說，其他如米，油，蔬菜，衣料，以及一切的日用品，無不驟然加價，如小白菜，不久之前祗賣三四分錢一斤，現在必要銅元廿枚，現在賣二分一匣，……無論什麽物品，價格已達到畸形高度，孤島生活，目前已是萬分不易了！</p>
<p>生活程度是不住的增高，然而我們總得要想出一個挽救的辦法才是，我一向就主張除去了竭力節約外，應該來推行一個廢物交換的運動，實行的辦法是以我的廢物去易別人的我所需用的廢物，這樣就不必以錢去買，但是要推行這一個運動，必須要擴大範圍，才能夠收效。</p>
<p>現在已有一個適合上述條件的服務社出現了，那就是靜安寺路上海婦女青年服務部最近附設於女青年會內的「家庭物品交易所」，並且完全是服務性質，不過那裏祗代人出賣新舊物品，但我們可將自己所有的不需用的物品到那裏去寄售，賣得的金錢，可再在那裏購買自己所需用的物品，那麼大家不需用的廢物，豈不是都可換得實用品了嗎？我認為該社的成立，實是極適合目前的需要，我慶倖著這是孤島居民所樂聞得福音，更歡躍的安慰我的希望現在居然實現了。</p>
<p>走進了該社，真簡直實置身在百貨商店中，凡屬家庭中所應用的物品，那裏樣樣都有，並且分門別類的陳列著，如綢緞，布匹，四季服裝，鞋帽，中裝，西裝，玩具，新舊皆備，每件貨品，都標明價格，這些物品，都是外界寄售的，社中祗收取一些開支上所必需的手續費。</p>
<p>該社最值得稱道的是無論新舊貨物，都可代售，那末我們從今以後，家中如有多餘的物品，棄之可惜，就可托該社出賣，這比賣給收舊貨的人要合算得多了。同時，我們如缺用什麽物品，買新的則經濟能力不夠，買舊的又不容易買到，那麼就可以到那裏去選購，好在那裏樣樣都有，而且價格也有一定標準，絕對不會吃虧，真是既便利，又經濟。</p>
<p>「家庭廢品交易設」自開幕以來，前去寄售及選購者頗為擁擠，足見該社是多麼的需要啊！我們希望一般熱心社會公益的人士，同來發起，多設立幾個同樣性質的物品交易社，至少必能使孤島居民的生活擔負上減輕幾分。</p>

<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>送毛迎言</p>
<p>世來去後，黃金當局，本想把盛字輩的高盛麟，貫盛習裘盛戎三個人留下，以為繼世以來登臺的言菊朋為配。其中貫盛習因尚係前次隨章遏蕓同來，來滬已久，歸心如箭，不願再繼續在滬演唱，高盛麟裘盛戎二人，以及小生江世玉，則蟬聯下來。黃金方面，所以要留下一批人，是因為言菊朋所帶的配角不多的緣故，隨言同來的，除了旦角豪柱侯玉蘭，只不過馬運昆王福山二人而已。現在姑且把侯馬王三人來談談：</p>
<p>侯玉蘭</p>
<p>侯女士今年二十一歲，父名月亭，為一票友，玉蘭自幼愛好皮簧，迨北平戲曲學校成立，玉蘭乃投入戲校肄業，戲校人才輩出，尤以旦角中之趙金蓉宋德珠侯玉蘭三人，實為晚近黎　中不可多得之人才。玉蘭品學兼優，曾三次考試，獨佔鰲頭，戲校校長金仲　氏，許為戲校最優秀之人才。趙金榮宋德珠皆先玉蘭離校，趙宋去後，玉蘭獨擋一面，乃成戲校之曩柱。去冬，玉蘭亦畢業，本有自行組班意，旋因故未果，而為　生奚嘯伯邀去，玉蘭去嘯伯合作以來，聲譽益增，有一日千里之概。以玉蘭為程玉霜之弟子故，舊京人士多以「女硯伙」月之，玉蘭之藝，得玉霜親授，學程頗具心得，程派傑作，玉蘭演來惟妙惟肖，幾能亂真玉霜。玉蘭嗓頗甜，扮相尤佳，者番隨菊朋同來，必能大受滬人之歡迎。</p>
<p>馬連昆</p>
<p>連尼工架子花，坐科富連成，為富連成二科之高材生，富連成出身之架子花人才，以侯喜瑞走紅最早，侯之後，連昆一人而已。（富連成二科架子花人才頗多，有王連浦劉連榮蘇連漢等人，其中最早露頭角者為馬連昆。）連昆之藝，兼候（李瑞）郝（壽臣）二人之長，架子氣派最佳，武工具相當功底，唱念亦有可取。連昆之白臉戲，頗負時譽，共人之藝，因適於興　生作配也。數年前，譚富英倚為左右手，今隨菊朋來，我不禁為菊朋稱慶，蓋菊朋有連昆在，必收牡丹綠葉之效也。</p>
<p>王福山</p>
<p>福山工丑，為王栓子（長林）之子，將門之後，自非庸俗之輩可比。福山之藝，得栓子之親授，故亦能文能武，文武兼優也。福山之藝，在後起一般丑角之上，嗓雖不能響亮，而頗有勁道。吃虧個子長，扮相難看，但武工極佳，身段亦靈活可取。福山當繼乃父後，而與楊小樓配戲，故演武丑之機會，較演文丑為多，是故福山之武丑戲，當較文丑為佳。文丑戲雖亦有可觀，但以演頑笑戲為佳，袍帶丑恐難愜人意，一菊朋之戲路論，丑角當以邀慈瑞泉茹當慧為配最妥，福山似不對工也。</p>
<p>上述三人，為隨菊朋同來之角色，其中似少一裏子老生，惟黃金方面，班底人才甚夥，當不致有何困難。至於菊朋此來，預料必能哄動一時。蓋菊朋已十載不與滬人相見，況其十年前之雄姿也。論菊朋之藝，實不愧為「譚派正宗」「音韻獨步」，富英好固好矣，要聽真有譚味之　生戲，允推菊朋獨步。近頃，　生以南麟（麟童）北馬（連良）最為吃香，無意將重興譚調，聆菊朋歌，吾人必耳目一新也。</p>

<p>派拉蒙公司未費分文</p>
<p>好萊塢著名女星桃樂姍拉摩小姐（Dorothy　Lamour）隸屬派拉蒙影片公司。近該公司拍攝「空航爭雄」（Disputed　Passaze）一片，拉摩小姐在片中扮演一個為中國養親所撫育的美國孤女，所以她將穿著中國女子的裝束，上演銀幕；以這樣一個婀娜多姿的西方美人，再加上東方的服飾，在我們想像起來，這個溶合中西美德尤物，一定別有一番峰巔。</p>
<p>至於派拉蒙公司當局，沒有為了拉摩小姐的「中國服裝」而費掉分文，因為剛巧我國女飛行家李霞卿女士，現在在美國作全境飛行，她在空中生活之餘，還遨游好萊塢，度其銀登生活。在這部影片中，却是初上鏡頭，她和拉摩小姐的友誼很好，親密得像嫡親姊妹一樣。她倆的體態長短和大小，不相上下，這次借穿衣服，不成問題。據說李女士的中國式服裝，如旗袍之類，計有百　之多，那不是儘夠拉摩小姐的選擇與採用了嗎？</p>

<h3 id="e1">Following Shantou, plotting to attack Fuzhou, Japanese Navy lands on Chuanshi Island, Japanese side claims military action will also be taken against Wenzhou, Chinese aid troops gather around Chaoshan area, defensive positions slightly shifted, Guangdong Northern Chinese mechanized units deploy and the air force frequently assists in battle. <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to authoritative sources in Hong Kong, several Japanese warships suddenly opened fire on Fuzhou at dawn on the 27th, bombarding it intensely. Subsequently, marines were dispatched to land on Chuanshi Island at the mouth of the Min River, 30 miles from Fuzhou. The situation in Fuzhou is extremely tense. Before landing, the Japanese side issued warnings to foreign businesses, stating that military action would be taken against Fuzhou and Wenzhou, and all ships were required to leave by noon on the 29th. Currently, a British destroyer is anchored off the coast of Fuzhou. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) In the Chaoshan Railway area, Chinese aid troops have gathered, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army. Traces of the Japanese army were discovered in Fengxi, three kilometers south of Chaozhou, and they were surrounded and annihilated last night. However, the situation in Chaozhou remains extremely tense. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The northern Guangdong front is quiet. Chinese mechanized units have been ordered to move south to strengthen defenses and await an opportunity to counterattack. The Chinese air force also frequently flies over northern Guangdong, bombing Japanese positions heavily. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Eight Japanese warships and eight or nine motorboats outside the mouth of the Min River suddenly attacked the Chinese blockade line outside the port at 6:10 this morning. The Japanese warships simultaneously opened fire, bombarding the revolutionary army's coastline for an hour and a half. Several Japanese aircraft also took off to assist. Around 8 o'clock, the artillery fire suddenly ceased, and four Japanese boats carrying hundreds of Japanese soldiers patrolled back and forth near the blockade line. Nine Japanese aircraft then took off from a large aircraft carrier, flying low over the coastal areas of Magui and Changle, and dropping bombs on Changle. Several other Japanese boats approached Chuanshi Island outside the port, forcibly landing several hundred soldiers. (Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Liuhuang According to reports, in Fuyang "more than twenty miles southwest of Chao'an" and Longhu Town (more than twenty miles south of Chao'an), more than a hundred Japanese cavalry were spotted at 10 PM on the 25th. They retreated immediately after being engaged by the Chinese army. The next day, the Japanese army sent reinforcements to attack again, and fierce fighting lasted all day. The Chinese army, deployed on this flat and boundless battlefield, relied on their burning passion to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Later, the Japanese army, relying on their convenient transportation, quickly sent reinforcements, putting great pressure on the Chinese army. In order to preserve its main force, the Chinese army had no choice but to retreat into certain defensive positions, awaiting reinforcements for a counterattack. (Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Liuhuang According to reports, fierce fighting has continued for days in the Caitang area. The Chinese army has held its ground firmly behind fortifications and has launched several counterattacks, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese army. Although the army has attacked fiercely with mechanized units, they have not succeeded so far. Subsequently, with the discovery of Japanese troops in Fuyang and Longhu, the rear of Caitang was suddenly threatened, and the troops immediately withdrew to the northeast. (Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) During today's parliamentary session, the news of Japan's intention to occupy Wenzhou and Fuzhou was mentioned. Labor Party member Greenwood raised the following questions: Is the government planning to send any instructions to ships in the area that may be affected by the situation? Is the Prime Minister considering cooperating with countries whose ships travel to Wenzhou and Fuzhou? Given the increasingly dangerous situation, is the British government making any progress in its proposed response? The Prime Minister replied that he could not answer those questions at the moment because news of the Japanese military's intention to land had only just been received. The Prime Minister did not respond to further questions. Before answering the above questions, Prime Minister Chamberlain stated that the naval commander stationed in Hong Kong had received news of the Japanese intention to occupy Fuzhou and Wenzhou and was awaiting detailed information. Regarding the situation in Tianjin, the Prime Minister stated that everything had been detailed in yesterday's statement, and there was nothing more to add at this time, but he hoped to have more to report soon. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) A Japanese detachment landed today at a coastal promontory (translated meaning) approaching Fuzhou. It is reported that the Japanese side warned foreign ships in advance to stay away from the waters outside Fuzhou, as military action would take place there imminently. A British destroyer is currently on standby at the promontory. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to sources here, Japanese warships gathered at the mouth of the Min River this morning, and Japanese marines landed at Jianfeng, opposite Luoxing Pagoda, 30 miles from Fuzhou. The Japanese army is apparently planning to use this as a base to attack Fuzhou. A U.S. gunboat is currently stationed in Fuzhou. According to the U.S. consulate, there are not many American residents in Fuzhou. Furthermore, the British ship "Muller," which was near Wenzhou, reported encountering a Japanese aircraft over the sea near Wenzhou that dropped a warning stating that "military action" would be taken there soon and warning ships not to enter the port. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, fighting is currently extremely fierce in the Anbu area northwest of Shantou. The Chinese army's fortifications there are very strong. The 11,000 Japanese soldiers in the area are mostly drawn from Guangzhou and Xiamen. Furthermore, a Chinese spokesman stated that the blockade line around Shantou had not been sufficiently strengthened in the past because the Chinese side wanted to maintain its foreign trade. The key points of the port were not militarized for the same reason, which made it easy to fall. According to foreign observers, Shantou is a seaport, and the Japanese navy will concentrate its attack there, making its fall sooner or later inevitable. Therefore, it is not necessary to spend large sums of money on building strong defensive fortifications. One of the reasons for the Japanese to capture Shantou is to cut off the Chinese side's import and export trade. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Chaoan According to reports, more than 500 Japanese soldiers launched several fierce attacks on Caitang on the 25th. The Chinese army put up a strong resistance, and fierce fighting broke out. On the evening of the 25th, Japanese cavalry were spotted in Fuyang, twenty miles northwest of Caitang, and fierce fighting is currently underway. (Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Chaoan More than twenty Japanese aircraft indiscriminately dropped bombs on various towns and villages in the Chaozhou region in batches today. The town of Chaozhou is under constant air raid alert, and the residents of the city have been evacuated as much as possible. (Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Jinhua At 8:10 on the morning of the 26th, five Japanese warships, six motorboats, and more than ten civilian ships, under the cover of artillery fire, forcibly landed at Yuhuan Kanmen Town, Yacheng, and other places. The Chinese army met them with a head-on attack, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army. Fierce fighting continued until night. (Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Japanese army in Shantou issued a communiqué today stating that Chaozhou, the northern terminus of the Shantou-Chaozhou Railway, was occupied by the Japanese army at 1:30 this morning. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A large number of Japanese warships and transport ships have gathered outside the port of Fuzhou, and it is expected that the Japanese army will soon land and fight in Fuzhou. According to Chinese estimates, there are approximately eighteen Japanese cruisers, destroyers, and transport ships anchored outside Fuzhou. However, according to the Chinese military, it will not be easy for Japanese warships to enter the port of Fuzhou because Fuzhou has water barriers, unlike Shantou. The Chinese side has completed its defensive fortifications in preparation for a Japanese landing, and all local administrative agencies have been moved inland. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) After the fall of Shantou, one branch of the Japanese army advanced along the Han River toward Chaozhou by motorboat, and another branch of the Japanese army advanced along the Shantou-Chaozhou Railway. Although the tracks and bridges have been destroyed, the terrain is flat and easy to travel. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) It is reported that the Japanese army has landed at Jianfeng on the coast near Fuzhou. The Japanese side had previously warned foreign ships not to enter Fuzhou, as war was about to break out. British naval authorities here have not yet received confirmation from British destroyers stationed there regarding the Japanese landing. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from the Japanese military headquarters, Chaozhou, the terminus of the Chaozhou-Shantou Railway, has been captured by the Japanese army. The city is 42 kilometers from Shantou. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to British reports here, the Japanese navy landed 30 miles from Fuzhou at dawn this morning. Before landing, the Japanese navy issued a warning to foreign ships, stating that there would be military action in the port and asking them to evacuate. Fuzhou is located north of the Min River, 30 miles from the sea, and has a population of 850,000. The only British warship currently there is the HMS Duchess. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to news received here, as a result of the Japanese army's three-pronged attack on Chaozhou, Chaozhou has been captured. Ten thousand Chinese soldiers have changed their positions and continue to resist. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Authorities order Chongqing residents to evacuate by the end of June.

<p>(Chongqing) According to sources here, the Chinese authorities have now ordered Chongqing residents to evacuate Chongqing by the end of June. Those who fail to evacuate after this date will be subject to imprisonment or fines. In order to prevent people from all over the country from gathering in Chongqing again, the Chongqing Garrison Command will set up additional checkpoints at the thoroughfares outside the city to check whether those entering the city have passports.

<p>Chaoyi According to reports, a Japanese reconnaissance plane, No. 854, flew to the vicinity of Hongdong to reconnoiter on the morning of the day before yesterday and was shot down by the Chinese army near Shangyao Village. The three Japanese pilots, Taotao Zhenmu, Hui Gu Shiye, and Wei Teng Tianzhen, were killed on the spot, and the fuselage was burned. The Chinese side seized two machine guns, telescopes, maps, and many other parts. (Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Chamberlain says Tianjin Incident may be resolved amicably, British Ambassador to Japan meets Arita again, discussing ways to resolve the Tianjin dispute, Japanese Foreign Minister visits various parties for secret talks, negotiations seem to be conducted in Tokyo. <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain made a declaration in the House of Commons today, stating that the Tianjin incident could be resolved amicably. Members of Parliament were surprised to hear this and asked on what basis the Prime Minister said so. Political figures said that British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie was only instructed to protest the maltreatment of British residents in Tianjin, not to discuss the entire issue. However, he still hoped that the Tianjin case could be resolved amicably, indicating that Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration was based less on new factors and more on expressing Ambassador Craigie's hopes. Although these people also hoped that the Tianjin case could reach a "compromise" solution, they did not express what kind of solution it would be. Diplomatic figures believe that the 50 million Chinese yuan deposited by Chinese banks in the British concession in Tianjin is the most coveted by the Japanese side, and it is more important than the extradition of four Chinese suspects in the Cheng Xigeng case. Opposition parties in Parliament deeply believe that the Japanese side will prolong the current ambiguous situation in Tianjin as much as possible, so that the British side believes that an amicable solution is still possible, and the implementation of economic retaliation will be delayed. At the same time, they are stepping up their efforts to undermine British prestige, so they are quite anxious. In short, the British government still hopes that the moderate faction in Japan will be willing to avoid economic conflict with Britain and will restrain the military, so it will wait a few more days, until the moderate faction is no longer able to do anything, and then announce the abolition of the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty.

<p>(London) According to Reuters' parliamentary correspondent, the Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee met last night and continued to consider the situation in the Far East. It is expected that it will soon announce the start of negotiations in Tokyo. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to semi-official Japanese sources, British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie received instructions from the British government yesterday to negotiate with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, which made Foreign Minister Arita quite busy today. According to Japanese sources, the British Ambassador suggested to Foreign Minister Arita that the Tianjin incident should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations in Tokyo. It is reported that Foreign Minister Arita secretly discussed the British proposal with Prime Minister Hiranuma this morning, and after attending the Cabinet meeting, he visited Minister of the Army Itagaki and Minister of the Navy Yonai to exchange views on the Tianjin issue. He visited Minister of the Army again at 3:00 p.m. for secret talks lasting about an hour. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Tianjin incident, British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie met with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita again this morning to study the Tianjin case and whether there was a possibility of an amicable solution. In addition, regarding the request from the Japanese naval authorities in China that warships and merchant ships of all countries leave the ports of Fuzhou and Wenzhou in China before the 29th of this month, officials here are unaware of this. Responsible parties believe that the rumors may be exaggerated, but in any case, the British will not give up their trading rights in the treaty ports in China. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita met for 40 minutes last night to discuss the basis for negotiating the Tianjin dispute. However, according to the Kokumin Shimbun, the British Ambassador conveyed Britain's attitude towards the Tianjin situation and requested a formal response from the Japanese government to Britain's protest.

<h3 id="e5">Britain should help China on a large scale. <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(London) Independent Progressive Party Member of Parliament Bartlett published an article in the News Chronicle today, stating that during the meeting of the British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee last night, someone suggested that Japan could cancel its movement in Tianjin under certain conditions. Therefore, in the next few days, the British side will find an excuse to hand over the four suspects in the Cheng Xigeng assassination case to the Chinese court, in other words, extradite them to the Japanese. This is not surprising. Bartlett argued that Britain should strengthen China's currency system, as this is the best way to force Japan to change its policies. Today's editorial in the same newspaper also urged the British side to provide large-scale financial and economic assistance to China, and said that if Britain does not retaliate against Japanese provocations, there is a real danger, because the National Socialist Party may determine that we do not care about Europe. The Daily Mail urged British women to stop buying Japanese goods, so that the Japanese government would know that its insulting policies are not worth the cost. The Manchester Guardian also stated that our most important ally in the Far East is China, not the United States or France. Most of the retaliatory measures currently proposed are to restrict Japanese exports to the British Empire. However, we must know that there are other more moderate methods that can be adopted, namely, helping China. We can supply China with loans, airplanes, and tanks to strengthen its resistance to Japan. This is also an effective response to Japan. The real front line in the Far East is not in Tianjin, Hong Kong, or Singapore, but in the mountains of northwestern China and the river basins of southern China. (London dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The Washington Star published an article today stating that Washington is now discussing the possibility of sending an American fleet to the Far East. British and French sea power are now preoccupied with affairs in Europe. In terms of the ability to protect the rights and interests of civilized nations at sea in the Far East, the American flag is the only symbol that can represent the rights and interests of civilized nations at sea in the Far East. Former U.S. President Roosevelt's plan to send the American fleet around the world in 1907, which paid special attention to Japan, can be reconsidered today. U.S. political circles have not criticized this suggestion, but during the recent tense situation in the Far East, naval circles discussed the possibility of moving the fleet to Hawaii or Manila. According to reliable sources, the U.S. authorities are most concerned about amending the Neutrality Act, so the government hopes to avoid actions that could hinder the passage of the Neutrality Act amendment. However, if other countries want to take advantage of this opportunity and say that the United States is only focused on domestic legislation and has no time to take care of other matters, then they are greatly mistaken.

<h3 id="e7">Review of the Soviet-Japanese Conflict <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>In China, in the area of Lake Bel, bordering Mongolia and Manchuria, the air and land forces of the Soviet Union and Japan have been fighting repeatedly from mid-May to the day before yesterday. Adding to this is a week-long propaganda war. What the two sides have announced, apart from still maintaining their original defenses to this day, and the consistency of their words, the rest is completely different. For example, Japan claimed that Soviet troops violated the border, and the Japanese-Manchukuo forces drove them out of the border, achieving a great victory; the Soviet Union claimed that Japanese troops violated the border, and the Soviet-Mongolian forces annihilated the enemy on the spot and repulsed them all; the number of enemy planes lost and soldiers killed and wounded claimed by each side is greatly disparate. Any military force represents its country, and its actions are part of the country's actions, which the country must take responsibility for. Now, the land and air forces of the Soviet Union and Japan have been fighting for more than a month. How can this not be a major national event? However, neither side, in their announcements, has attributed the conflict to a misunderstanding, nor has either side held the other accountable. The two countries still have their exchange of envoys, and no routine diplomatic protests have been heard. The forbearance of the two countries is truly a miracle. When the news spread far and wide, the world was refreshed, but the impression reflected was mostly regarded as novel and large-scale news, without considering it an extremely important and worrying unexpected serious change. Alas, is this numbness? International norms have been lost, world affairs are on the brink of extreme danger, and there is no shock at bloodshed. However, at the very least, this is news. We journalists are willing to review it.</p>
<p>Based on the propaganda of both the Soviet Union and Japan regarding the results of the military conflict, it is difficult to judge which side suffered heavier losses and which side occupied a superior position due to lack of sufficient evidence. However, based on common sense: The Soviet Union admitted on May 28 that its air force suffered the loss of nine aircraft due to lack of preparation, while destroying three of the enemy's aircraft, without concealing its defeat; while Japan's self-reported record is one of invincibility; this is one point. In air battles, the Soviet Union's account of the number of aircraft on both sides is always similar, with the Soviet Union's losses being less and Japan's losses being more, but still relatively close; in air battles, Japan's account of the number of aircraft on both sides is always that the Soviet Union had more aircraft and Japan had fewer, and the Soviet Union's losses were five or ten times greater than Japan's; this is another point. Even these two points alone make it impossible to discover the most accurate reality. However, the Japanese side's exaggeration is so great that common sense judges it to be false. Japan has clearly lost in this "propaganda war." Propaganda must be sincere, or at least close to the truth. Japanese-style propaganda seeks to exaggerate without seeking credibility. This has always been the case, and the Soviet-Japanese conflict is just one example.</p>
<p>Regarding the origin of the conflict, the Soviet Union and Japan each blamed the other for violating the border. To violate the border is to be proactive, to be on the offensive, and to bear the responsibility. We cannot evaluate the responsibility based on the propaganda of both sides. However, generally speaking: The Soviet government, in its fundamental policies, is determined not to participate in war, let alone launch war. The Japanese government, in its international policies, only wishes not to fight the Soviet Union alone. During these two years of invading China, its strength has been depleted, and it is afraid that the Soviet Union will provoke a war. How could it be willing to start a war with the Soviet Union? This is the reality of both sides, and we secretly believe that it is in accordance with reason. Therefore, it can be deduced that this conflict was not initiated by instructions from Tokyo or Moscow. Yesterday's report from the German Haitong News Agency in Tokyo, claiming that people in Tokyo political circles said that the conflict was not an isolated incident but an organized action by Moscow to contain the Japanese army and remotely aid China, is clearly another distorted propaganda with a different purpose. In terms of having a different purpose, the Soviet Union's national conditions are simple, and the government's choices never deviate from fundamental policies, so "small actions" with a different purpose are less necessary. Japan, on the other hand, seeks to advance or retreat both internally and externally, and its national conditions and national policies are not like those of the Soviet Union, so its rulers often need small actions with a different purpose at times, and it is reasonable to create propaganda materials. Even with these claims, we still do not believe that the conflict was initiated in Tokyo. Not initiated by Tokyo, and even less by Moscow, then the conflict must have been an individual action by the local garrison. In terms of individual actions, we will not take the Soviet Union's published secret order of the commander of the Japanese 23rd Division (see yesterday's newspaper) as ironclad proof that the Japanese side initiated the conflict, but we may as well ask two questions: Did the Soviet garrison violate Moscow's policies and attack the Japanese defense line without receiving orders from Moscow? Did the Japanese garrison violate Tokyo's policies and attack the Soviet defense line without receiving orders from Tokyo? Which of these two scenarios has a precedent, which has a habit, and which has a higher possibility? The conflict is a matter for both sides, but it is definitely not launched simultaneously by both sides without intention. Therefore, there must be one side that is proactive, takes the offensive, and bears the responsibility! We secretly believe that the possibility of this conflict being initiated by the Japanese garrison is higher.</p>
<p>We do not want to act as interpreters to explain everything about others. We are only assuming that the aforementioned reasoning is not wrong and analyzing the rationale for initiating the conflict. We believe that Japan's joys and sorrows, its wandering down divergent paths in the international arena, have their own internal contradictions, which have led to fragmented actions. There are extreme right-wingers who advocate being hostile to the Soviet Union, severing ties with Britain, and thoroughly allying with Germany and Italy; there are moderates who advocate maintaining the anti-Soviet front with Germany and Italy while avoiding deepening friction with Britain, France, and the United States. The two factions are evenly matched domestically and are in a state of waxing and waning. Surrounding the Tianjin concession, landing in Shantou, and even engaging in clashes with the Soviet garrison are all ways to force the moderates to sever ties with Britain, and also ways to make the unexpected tension in Soviet-Japanese relations promote relations with Germany and Italy. At the same time, it shows the deterioration of Soviet-Japanese relations, causing Britain to shy away and abandon its alliance with the Soviet Union, which is also a way to serve Germany and Italy and strengthen the solidarity of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Running around in all directions, there is indeed a consistent consciousness running through it as a thread.</p>

<p>(Beijing) The anti-British movement organized by the Japanese in Beijing has made no progress among the Chinese people. Yesterday's mass rally, which invited thousands of students, teachers, and officials to participate, was a complete failure. Only 500 people attended, and the subsequent procession failed to attract any interest. Newspapers controlled by the Japanese have published several columns of anti-British propaganda, but few listen to them. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Today, no unexpected incidents occurred at the entrances and exits of the concessions. The general feeling is that the situation here has slightly eased. Some people believe that this situation is a sign that major negotiations regarding the Tianjin situation are currently underway in Tokyo. According to reliable Chinese sources, Japanese sentries searching those passing through the concession entrances and exits have been replaced this morning, at least at the Wanguo Bridge, and seem to have received certain orders. According to sources in the foreign community, this matter may confirm the remarks made by the Japanese military commander, which have been notified to the Japanese sentries. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The shortage of milk has not improved this morning, making the situation in the British concession hospitals even more serious, and many patients are affected. A Japanese customs official in the isolation hospital also has no milk available. The hospital administrator has notified the Consul-General that the official's life is in danger due to the inability to obtain milk. Several foreign visitors arrived here this morning and were led by Japanese officers on a tour in front of various obstacles. They were riding in several luxurious Japanese military automobiles, each carrying two officers and visitors. They passed through the British concession and entered the former German concession. It is heard that the Japanese Consulate will hold a special meeting for these visitors this morning. A Reuters reporter went to the border this morning and saw nothing unusual, but there was still a long line of Chinese people wanting to enter the British and French concessions who were being deliberately searched. According to unconfirmed Chinese sources, just after 11 pm on Sunday night, 60 Chinese guerrillas attacked the police station in the southern suburbs of Tianjin. Rifle fire continued for some time, clearly heard in the British concession. By the time Japanese soldiers and Chinese police reinforcements arrived, the guerrillas had retreated, taking several Chinese policemen hostage as they left. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)</p>

The contents include the following three points: (1) Acknowledging receipt of the Japanese protest regarding the British newspapers' distortion of facts. (2) Requesting the Japanese Consul-General to provide evidence for the matters protested. (3) The British Consul-General will send a copy of the signed statements of the British subjects who have been insulted to the Japanese authorities, and at the same time request an investigation and reply.

<p>(Tianjin) General Honma, commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, stated today while hosting foreign journalists here that the Japanese authorities had instructed the search personnel this morning not to engage in insulting actions, that British subjects could be exempted from strip searches, and that the search personnel were ordered to be more cautious in all measures. The commander emphasized that the Japanese are not ashamed of nudity and smiled as he offered to take off his clothes in public to prove his point. He then mentioned the Japanese custom of mixed bathing for men and women, saying that there is nothing insulting about being seen naked. The commander solemnly stated that he had not received any news of foreigners being stripped and that he had not issued such an order. The current restrictions will continue to be implemented until the British change their attitude. Japan's current methods will continue indefinitely, even if the British take retaliatory measures against Japan. The commander also mentioned the four demands regarding the Tianjin incident recently submitted by the "Provisional Government" to the British and French embassies in Beijing, saying that these demands were prepared by the "Provisional Government" and were not discussed with Japan beforehand, but that their content roughly represents Japan's opinions and aspirations. A reporter asked what the minimum demands of the Japanese army in Tianjin would be. The commander replied that he could not disclose this, that he did not know whether it would be resolved in Tianjin, Tokyo, or London, but hoped that the matter could be resolved locally. When the commander mentioned the blockade of the Tianjin concessions, he solemnly stated that although the details of this matter had not been discussed with Tokyo, all plans were implemented under orders from Tokyo. Calling the current situation in Tianjin a "blockade" is inaccurate; it should be called "restrictions on traffic." The Japanese authorities have no intention of cutting off the food supply to the concessions. The current difficulties are due to unavoidable delays at the entrances and exits, which are necessary for a thorough search of all goods entering the concessions. As for river traffic, it has not been restricted except for the inspection of ships entering and leaving the port, and river traffic cannot be restricted without a special order from Tokyo. Regarding the British military trucks, this was because the trucks did not comply with the traffic regulations, as the trucks wanted to travel on one-way traffic roads. When reporters asked if the restrictions would be further tightened, General Honma hesitated for a moment and then replied that the plan adopted was flexible, so the possibility of tightening could not be ruled out.

<p>(Tianjin) Mr. Holthus, son of the former British Consul in Tianjin, was ordered to strip today and suffered various other humiliations, as witnessed by me (Associated Press Far East Manager, Mr. Mullisher), as I happened to be standing outside the door of the search post at the intersection of Wilson Street. At that time, a puppet Chinese policeman was ordered by a Japanese sentry, and the Chinese policeman immediately forced Mr. Holthus to strip and unbutton his trousers. Then, Mr. Holthus was ordered to let his trousers fall to the ground, and the Chinese policeman searched him all over. When I entered the search post, a puppet Chinese policeman touched my pockets and ordered me to sit down. However, the Japanese person standing there glanced at me briefly and, after examining my American passport and card, let me go. Mr. Holthus lives near the Xiangzong Guild Hall outside the British concession, but his office is in the British concession. I specially accompanied Mr. Holthus today from his office to his residence outside the British concession. At the Japanese sentry line, we were forced to walk through a 50-foot-long muddy lane to the search shed. When we entered the search shed, a Chinese coolie was being searched. Mr. Holthus took off his hat, and I passed through without difficulty, quietly watching the puppet Chinese policeman search Mr. Holthus at the other end of the lane. While the Chinese policeman was searching him, a Japanese sentry sitting on a chair issued orders from time to time. Mr. Holthus was first ordered to take off his shoes and socks, and then to take off his clothes, which he did one by one without any objection. Finally, the Japanese soldier glanced at his pockets, and Mr. Holthus emptied all the contents of his pockets onto the ground. The Chinese policeman then pulled Mr. Holthus's trouser legs up to his knees and his shirt bottom up to his shoulders, as ordered by the Japanese sentry. He was then ordered to undo his trousers, and the Chinese policeman groped him arbitrarily. Only then was Mr. Holthus ordered to proceed. So Mr. Holthus began to retrieve all his clothes, socks, etc., and went to the exit to put them on. All these humiliating actions were carried out in front of a group of Chinese coolies waiting to pass through. According to Mr. Holthus, he has suffered the humiliation of strip searches four times since the British concession was blockaded. According to Mr. Holthus, the British Consul has asked British subjects not to enter or leave the concession unless necessary, so he plans not to return to the British concession in the next few days. Also, no matter who it is, when passing through the search shed, unless they have a special pass, they must get out of the car or rickshaw and walk to the search shed. This type of search shed was built by the Japanese a month ago, and at most only ten or so people pass through it in an hour. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Another major incident of interference with a British ship occurred today. The ship interfered with was the Ariadne Moller. The details of this matter will only be known for certain after the ship arrives at the British concession and the captain reports. It is heard that the ship arrived at Tanggu on Friday and, after being delayed for some time, sailed up the river and arrived at the riverside of the former German concession on Sunday morning. It is heard that the Japanese did not allow the ship to dock at the Dalian Steamship Company wharf for inspection but was forced to dock downstream. The ship was ordered to dock at the Dashut Steamship Company wharf, but the previous order was soon cancelled, and this happened several times. The food on the ship gradually ran out, and the fifteen foreign passengers, of whom only one was British, had nothing to eat from Sunday noon. Communication between the ship and the shore was also not permitted by the Japanese. Finally, the foreign passengers were notified that they could disembark at 1:30 am yesterday. What the fate of the 200 Chinese passengers will be is currently unknown. The ship has not yet arrived at the riverside of the British concession, but according to the shipping company, it will arrive this afternoon. It is heard that British Consul-General Jamieson has tried to persuade British firms not to let their British employees leave the concession. It is heard that several British subjects, including Mr. Holthus, who has repeatedly suffered the humiliation of being stripped, are currently on vacation. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>Chinese newspapers report that the North China Liaison Department of the Japanese Koa-in recently announced a plan to develop Tanggu Port as a prelude to establishing Greater Tianjin, in order to reduce the importance of the British and French concessions as the financial center of North China. It is heard that the announcement of this plan is related to the Japanese blockade of the British concession. It is expected that when this plan is realized, the two Tianjin concessions will gradually lose their importance as the financial center of North China. According to Chinese sources, the plan includes modernizing the loading and unloading facilities in Special Area 1 (former German concession) and Special Area 3 (former Russian concession).

<h3 id="e14">U.S. Senate and House Pass Currency Act Extension for Two Years; Senate Passes Three Amendments; Stop Buying Foreign Silver; Abolish Presidential Devaluation Prerogative <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The powers enjoyed by President Roosevelt in currency matters (namely, the power to change the gold content of the dollar, to purchase domestic silver at a fixed price by the Ministry of Finance, and to establish an Exchange Equalization Fund of 2 billion US dollars) expire on the 30th of this month. The government has submitted a bill requesting an extension of the validity period for two years. The House of Representatives approved it on April 2nd. The Senate recently discussed the bill and passed it immediately, but with three amendments attached: (1) An amendment proposed by Colorado Democratic Senator Adams, abolishing the President's power to change the gold content of the dollar; (2) Regarding the price of domestic silver, which is set at 77.57 cents per ounce, Nevada Senator Pittman advocated setting it at 1.16 US dollars per ounce, but was rejected; (3) An amendment proposed by Colorado Republican Senator Townsend, prohibiting the Ministry of Finance from purchasing silver from abroad after the 30th of this month. In other words, the current silver purchase law will be abolished from the 30th of this month. Regarding this, Senate Democratic Leader Barkley delivered a speech before the vote, saying that the United States is purchasing silver from China and Mexico, and that these countries use the proceeds from selling silver to purchase goods from the United States. If this amendment is approved, the amount of American goods purchased by these countries will inevitably be reduced. At this moment, a certain country is trying to monopolize the international market. If you think that American goods do not need to be sold to Mexico and China, you may as well deprive these countries of their ability to purchase goods." After the Senate's discussion, Townsend's amendment was finally approved by a show of hands. Because the amendments passed by the Senate are very different from the original bill passed by the House of Representatives, the two houses will inevitably organize a joint committee to jointly formulate a unified clause. However, because the House of Representatives has not abolished the silver purchase law, the government can continue to purchase silver from abroad until the House of Representatives abolishes the law. However, according to observations from political circles, this law will inevitably be abolished. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(New York) After the Senate decided to raise the price of domestic silver purchased by the Ministry of Finance from 64.64 cents per ounce to 77.57 cents, the Democratic New York Times recently criticized it, saying, "The result of the government's implementation of the silver purchase policy has artificially raised the price of domestic silver to 64.64 cents per ounce, which is 50% higher than the world market price, which is already inappropriate. How can the price be raised again? The silver purchase is originally a crazy move. Fortunately, the Senate has now decided to stop purchasing silver from abroad and only allow the purchase of domestic silver, which cannot be said to be completely devoid of common sense." (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Senate's cancellation of the silver purchase decree yesterday immediately suspended the government's silver purchase policy. The Senate's silver faction also united with conservatives, and by a vote of 40 to 30, limited the domestic silver price to 77.5 cents per ounce. The Senate also voted 47 to 31 to abolish President Roosevelt's prerogative to devalue the currency. The above two proposals were originally jointly proposed by Democratic Senators Pittman and Adams, but because the government firmly opposed them, they were not discussed in combination. Furthermore, the U.S. Currency Balance Fund will terminate supply this Friday, but yesterday's resolution had no effect on this. Observers here all believe that the U.S. government may make concessions to the silver group in order to restore the President's authority over the currency system. Yesterday, all Republican senators (except Senator Borah) adopted the same attitude as the silver faction and Democratic conservatives. Senator Pittman immediately proposed an amendment to change the silver price to 1.16 US dollars per ounce, but it was ultimately rejected by a vote of 26 to 52. According to sources from the silver group, a careful discussion should be made before the currency system bill is passed. According to this statement, it is actually intimidating those who intend to obstruct by delaying methods. Furthermore, according to Senate leaders, if the silver faction wants to extend the debate, a meeting will continue to be held tonight. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e15">Mexico Greatly Shocked by the News; Fears Negative Impact on Political and Economic Aspects <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Mexico City The relevant authorities in Mexico City were extremely shocked upon learning that the U.S. Senate had passed the Townsend Amendment, deciding to stop purchasing silver from abroad. However, they still hope that President Roosevelt can exercise his rights to veto it. Because silver sales account for a little less than one-third of the Mexican government's annual income, if the United States stops purchasing silver, the Mexican government will inevitably issue more paper money, reduce the value of the peso (Mexican currency name), and raise tax rates to compensate. After Mexico confiscated the oil mines of American merchants, the economic situation was already very difficult. If the above-mentioned measures are taken again, it will inevitably arouse public resentment and have a negative impact. Even from a political point of view, President Cárdenas's political enemies, whether they belong to the right or the left, can take the opportunity to oppose the current government. The impact is difficult to foresee. People around President Cárdenas recently said, "If the Townsend Amendment is implemented, not only will China be abandoned and fall into bankruptcy, but Mexico will also be controlled by the forces of Germany and Italy, and its market will be monopolized by Japanese goods. It is hoped that President Roosevelt will not allow it to be implemented." (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e18">U.S. Neutrality Law Amendment; House Begins Debate; Repeal Embargo on Arms Clause; Isolationists Still Strongly Obstructing <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the Neutrality Law issue, the amendment proposed by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom is scheduled to be submitted to the House for discussion tomorrow. The Democratic members of the Foreign Affairs Committee recently held a secret meeting to study the contents of the bill and prepare for the debate by the Democratic members, hoping that the Bloom bill would be easily approved by the House. According to the knowledge of the members in the Congressional lounge, the members plan to cancel the clause in the Bloom bill authorizing the President to designate war zones and prohibit American merchant ships from entering war zones, and at the same time allow the repeal of the clause prohibiting the transport of arms to belligerent countries. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The amendment to the Neutrality Law proposed by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom, which advocates repealing the current embargo on arms clause, will be submitted to the House for discussion tomorrow. According to informed sources in political circles, if Congress has not voted on the new Neutrality Law when it adjourns for summer vacation, President Roosevelt may convene a special session of Congress to discuss it. At this moment, the State Department also insists that this bill must be concluded before Congress adjourns. In view of this, the Bloom bill can be approved by the House, but it is not yet known whether the Senate will pass it. Although there are only 20 or 30 senators opposing the Bloom bill, most of them are highly respected. Therefore, the strength of the opposition in Congress must be observed by the number of votes in favor and against after the House vote. At this moment, isolationists all say that if the war in Europe is unavoidable, then the United States will not be able to stop it. The key is to prevent the United States from being dragged into the vortex. Now President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull want the United States to immediately stand on the same front as the democratic countries in Europe, which is inappropriate. Those who support amending the current Neutrality Law firmly believe that the United States does have the power to prevent war, believing that if all aggressor countries know that once a war starts, the United States will provide material and spiritual assistance to Britain and France, they will naturally retreat in the face of difficulties. The best course of action now is to quickly amend the current Neutrality Law so that Chancellor Hitler can clearly understand the attitude of the United States, thereby contributing to the establishment of peace. The isolationist and government factions are deadlocked in this way. However, most of the American press supports amending the Neutrality Law, and only the newspapers belonging to the Hearst (American press tycoon) family still urge readers to exert pressure on Congress to reject the amendment proposed by Bloom. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(New York) The Democratic New York Times recently published a commentary, saying that the current Neutrality Law must be amended according to the Bloom proposal so that the government can promote a diplomatic policy to reduce the crisis of a world war. The best way to eliminate war is to warn countries that are exhausted by soldiers and armed forces in time, so that they understand the opposing forces they will encounter, which occupy an absolute advantage. The position of the United States is extremely important. In other words, if we now officially inform these countries that the United States will provide resources for those who fight for self-defense, and at the same time, aggressor countries cannot control maritime traffic, they will not be able to obtain these resources. In this way, these countries will inevitably avoid war to avoid self-destruction. In this respect, the Bloom Amendment is sufficient to use the power of the United States to protect our country's security and to make our country's position and international law respected. Its contribution to eliminating war and establishing peace is by no means superficial." (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(London) Many of the Yorkshire yarn factories in Britain are processing and weaving tea-colored cloth in preparation for the use of 2 million British conscripts, militias, and local troops. The length of the cloth can reach 2,000 miles, enough to stretch from the east coast to the west coast of the Atlantic. The labor cost for clothing will total 20 million US dollars. The War Department's contractor worked day and night for several days after Prime Minister Chamberlain announced the conscription. Civilian tailors are also cooperating with government contractors. Even at a speed of one shirt per minute, they still feel overwhelmed. At the same time, the War Department also needs to order other types of uniforms for other troops. Recent orders include 2 million yards of raw materials for cotton trousers covers to meet the needs of the Air Force, and 15 million yards of thick cotton cloth to meet the needs of the formal army.

<h3 id="e22">If England and Japan Go to War, China and England Will Definitely Form an Alliance, and China's Resistance Will Definitely Be Strengthened: Radio Address by British Rear Admiral <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(London) Former Director of Naval Intelligence, Vice Admiral Opens, recently delivered a radio address on the topic of "Pacific Defense Issues," stating that he believes if war breaks out between England and Japan, China will automatically become an ally of England and can be easily assisted through railway, air, and road transportation. As a result, China's resistance strength will certainly increase, and Japan, exhausted, will inevitably be defeated. Fortunately, both England and Japan are willing to resolve various disputes through agreements, so war between the two countries may not occur." In my opinion, England, France, and the United States should organize a conference in the Far East. When necessary, they can jointly send a note to Japan, which Japan would not dare to ignore. The combined military strength of the three countries is so powerful that Japan would not dare to provoke them. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) According to Rear Admiral Oping, former head of naval intelligence, in a radio address today, if war breaks out between England and Japan in the Far East, England will surely win. "I firmly believe that after a war breaks out between England and Japan, China's resistance will certainly be strengthened, and as a result, Japan will collapse due to exhaustion. Even if a major war breaks out simultaneously in Europe, and the main force of the British Navy cannot but focus on Europe, we can still defeat Japan." At that time, the British Navy must first concentrate on Europe to resolve Germany and Italy, and then turn eastward to attack Japan. Therefore, at the beginning of a war between England and Japan in the Far East, the British Navy can only take a defensive posture based on Singapore, and will certainly be able to secure the area west of Singapore and Australia and New Zealand with ease. As for aid to China, it can also be provided continuously through the Burma Road, railways, and air transport. Therefore, England's victory over Japan is practically assured.

<p>(Paris) Diplomatic circles here recently received news from abroad that the major powers are actively engaged in military activities, no different from what they did before the repeated tensions in the European situation. It can be seen that the international situation will experience another crisis within a few weeks. This can be seen in the following events: (1) Before the signing of the German-Italian military alliance treaty, General Lidell, Commander-in-Chief of the German National Defense Forces, and Baliani, Deputy Minister of the Italian Army, held talks in Innsbruck. Recently, Admiral Reidel, Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy, and General Gavaniari, Head of the Italian Navy, conducted talks in Friedrichshafen, Germany, to determine cooperation methods between the two navies. As for the cooperation between the air forces of both sides, General Goering, Minister of Aviation of Germany, is also conducting talks with General Vaye, Head of the Italian Air Force. (2) German-Italian military measures have been extended to Africa. General Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, went to Italian Libya in North Africa to lay the foundation for joint German-Italian actions in North Africa. (3) General Batoglio, Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, recently went to Albania to inspect defense, and has now returned to Rome. After Albania was occupied by Italy, it has recently stationed 120,000 Italian troops. (4) The Italian Navy's First Fleet, including the battleships "Cavour" and "Caesar," ten cruisers, and more than twenty destroyers and torpedo boats, is conducting a "symbolic cruise" in the Atlantic Ocean. The Second Fleet will sail east on July 1, heading to Italian Libya, Albania, and the Aegean Sea. In effect, the entire Italian Navy is about to be mobilized. (5) The Italian Army will conduct large-scale exercises in the north. (6) The number of German Army personnel this summer will be 1.4 million. Along the German-Polish border, 200,000 workers are rushing to build fortifications. This is clearly a threat to the Free City of Danzig. The re-emergence of tension in the European situation can be seen from the above. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Danzig Vorposten, the organ newspaper of the National Socialist Party in the Free City of Danzig, recently issued an appeal to the city's residents, saying, "All my fellow citizens, in a short period of time, need to remain calm and united. This is essential today, because only after being united can we realize all necessary conditions and enable the citizens of Danzig to achieve their ultimate goal." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Danzig: Preparations are underway here to organize irregular forces, which will be composed of the National Socialist Party Army and the Hitler Youth. Youths aged sixteen to twenty have been secretly dispatched to East Prussia and other parts of Germany for two weeks of rigorous training. The location of these youths is being carefully kept secret by the local authorities. However, these youths are expected to return here on July 1. Sixteen barracks are being built in the Free City and should be completed in time for use. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) The Admiralty recently issued a communiqué stating, "The summer leave for officers and men of the ships belonging to the headquarters fleet will be brought forward to July this year, so that these ships can enter dock in July for repairs. After completion, exercises can be held earlier in August. The ships sailing to certain places along the coast in mid-July has also been decided to be cancelled. Furthermore, Navy Week, which is held every year in early August, will also be cancelled this year." People in Parliament recently commented on this matter, saying, "According to news from Germany, the international situation in the second half of August this year is feared to become extremely tense again. The Admiralty authorities, in order to prepare for the worst, have decided to bring forward the date of the naval exercises (which were held in September last year). Only by being prepared to deal with the most dangerous situation can there be the greatest hope of safeguarding peace. Moreover, compared to last year, not only will the naval exercises be held earlier, but the total tonnage and armament of the British fleet have also increased significantly." People in naval circles do not believe that the early exercises of the British fleet have anything to do with the international situation, but diplomatic circles claim that "German politicians have recently made repeated fierce speeches, and the country's newspapers have repeatedly criticized Britain, and have made various allusions to the resolution of the Danzig Free City issue. The British government has therefore decided to take various steps to prepare for any eventuality." (Havas, 26th)</p>

<p>Copenhagen, Denmark: The 10th Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) was opened yesterday by the King of Denmark. 1,347 representatives from 40 countries attended. The conference chairman, Peterson, delivered the opening address, saying, "The ICC has been working hard for 20 years, moving towards its ultimate goal, and has made more progress than in its early stages.

<p>(London) Today is the second day of the conference held by the British Empire Press Union. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler attended and delivered a speech, saying, "Seeking peace is our first virtue. Therefore, the British Empire will never aim at aggression. To this day, we are not opposed to changing the status quo, but we are opposed to changing it by force. Moreover, the League of Nations covenant originally contained a clause for amending the status quo by peaceful means, but unfortunately, certain countries have never invoked or used it. As for our country's new policy, it has two major characteristics: one is strength, and the other is understanding. A balance must be struck between the two. Although we are determined to implement the new policy, we are not indifferent to new forces and new needs, nor will we seek temporary peace at any cost. Now, we have heard demands for establishing a new order in both the Far East and the West, but the goal of the British Empire is even greater than this. In other words, based on past experience and understanding of its own strength, as well as the understanding relations it maintains with various countries, it will establish a new world order, that is, create a new world amidst the current difficulties. This is indeed our urgent task. As for the establishment of an information department in the Foreign Office, our intention is not to use it as a propaganda factory, but as a photography studio to capture our true image and publicize it to all countries in the world."

<p>(London) The Cabinet Foreign Policy Committee held a meeting at 6 PM today, chaired by Prime Minister Chamberlain himself, to discuss the progress of the tripartite negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. It approved the new instructions to Sir Seeds, the ambassador to the Soviet Union, which are said to be able to further advance the current negotiations, and the final agreement is also expected to be established. According to well-informed sources, the British government will make another revision of its views on mutual assistance methods, the inherent nature thereof, and the issue of guaranteeing other countries, in order to bring them closer to the Soviet Union's views. In other words: (1) Any neutral country whose preservation of independence is considered by one of the three signatory countries (Britain, France, and the Soviet Union) to be of vital importance, shall, in the event of aggression or the threat of aggression, automatically implement mutual assistance. (2) All countries, whether neutral or guaranteed by the three signatory countries, that indirectly benefit from the tripartite mutual assistance method should clearly indicate their names. Difficulties may arise in this regard, because the British government clearly intends to include Switzerland and the Netherlands in the list, but these countries do not maintain normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union may object, which is not necessarily certain. Ambassador Seeds submitted a lengthy memorandum to the government, requesting that significant concessions be made to the Soviet Union's demands, so that the British-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement could be completed quickly. Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax made a thorough study of this memorandum this afternoon, and immediately drafted instructions, which were submitted to the Cabinet Foreign Policy Committee for approval. Once the Cabinet approves the report, it will be sent to Ambassador Seeds by telegraph. According to sources close to the Foreign Office, the scope of the new instructions is quite broad, and Ambassador Seeds will not need to consult the government frequently when conducting negotiations with the Soviet authorities in the future.

<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: For nearly half a month, the Japanese side has dispatched warships loaded with aircraft to bomb Fuzhou as many as three or four times each day, indiscriminately dropping incendiary bombs. Prosperous streets and important military shops have all been burned and destroyed, with losses amounting to as much as five or six million yuan.

<p>(9) Yong'an (i.e., the new provincial capital of Fujian): At 8:00 AM on the 9th, seven Japanese planes, taking off from a Japanese warship in Xiamen, passed through Haicheng, Longxi, and Zhangping and invaded the urban area, dropping 13 bombs on the Normal School, the County Government Prison, the Post and Telegraph Bureaus, and outside the South Gate and West Gate, shaking down four houses of the Normal School, one house of the County Government Prison, and one post office, and bombing to death 11 prisoners and injuring six. Quanzhou was also subjected to two air raids on the same day. The first time was at 9:30 AM when four Japanese planes dropped ten bombs on Zhongshan Road, Shiba Wan, East Street, Hua Lane, and other places in the city, destroying more than 30 houses and killing or injuring more than 40 people. One of the bombs happened to land in an air-raid shelter in Shiba Wan, killing all twenty-plus people hiding inside, which was extremely tragic. Quanzhou Middle School and Mingtou Hall were also bombed and destroyed. The second time was at 1:00 PM when 12 bombs were dropped in Minglun Town, Zhongshan Road, and other places, destroying 13 houses, killing seven people, and injuring 12.

The essence of the entire city was reduced to scorched earth. The Catholic Church, Chengtian Temple, and the First Building landmark were all bombed and destroyed, making it an unprecedented disaster for Quanzhou.</p>
<p>(11) Tingzhou: At 9:00 AM on the 10th, two Japanese planes, invading from the border of Jiangxi, dropped two bombs near the county government and two bombs near the county nursery, collapsing two houses, killing two people, and injuring three.</p>
<p>(12) Longxi, Haicheng, Shima, and Tong'an: From 12:00 PM to 7:00 PM on the 12th, 24 Japanese planes, taking off from a Japanese warship in Xiamen, bombed in batches and in rotation, dropping a total of more than 50 bombs. However, because there were air raids from noon to evening without a break, long-distance telephone lines were disrupted, so the extent of the losses is unknown. It is only known that Haicang and Jiaowei in Haicheng, and Aotou and Liuwudian in Tong'an suffered severely. The provincial government, seeing that the air raids are becoming increasingly fierce, has ordered the county governments to immediately work with local agencies and charitable organizations to organize air raid emergency relief offices, establish refugee shelters to accommodate refugees whose houses have been destroyed by air raids and who have nowhere to go, and establish treatment centers to treat people injured by Japanese planes.</p>

<p>Kunshan Dispatch: Recently, because the front lines are unfavorable, the Japanese troops stationed in the rear have been busy with troop movements, resulting in frequent transportation. The Japanese troops stationed in Kunshan are all reserves and have recently been ordered to depart. Before leaving, they forcibly conscripted civilians everywhere. Anyone drinking tea in tea houses or listening to storytelling in book halls was dragged away. For a time, the whole city was in turmoil, and people were panicking. It is estimated that over a hundred people were conscripted.</p>
<h3 id="e44">The Bravery of Jinmen People's Restore Homeland and Save the Village Corps; Gathering in Lianjiang to Launch a Night Attack on Jinmen; Killing Over Forty Japanese Soldiers in One Night <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Jinmen has been occupied for a full year and a half. Jinmen people displaced in various places, seeing their homeland suffering all kinds of ravages, have organized the Restore Homeland and Save the Village Corps. The corps gathered on the evening of the 20th of April in Lianjiang, each person carrying rifles, Mauser pistols, and a large number of hand grenades, and boarded sailboats straight to Jinmen Island. They landed on the coast near Guanao and advanced in separate routes to encircle the Japanese garrison in Guanao and the Japanese artillery fort in Chengzi Corner. At about 2:00 AM that night, they first killed the Japanese sentries, cut off the telephone lines, and then threw hand grenades fiercely. Under the command of the brave Chen (name missing) and Lu (name missing), the corps leader and vice corps leader of the Jinmen Restore Homeland and Save the Village Corps, these brave men fought to be the first to charge. The Japanese soldiers, suddenly awakened by the sound of explosions, were panic-stricken. Over thirty garrison troops and a dozen artillery fort soldiers were annihilated in less than half an hour. These brave men seized the Japanese weapons and destroyed the artillery fort at Chengzi Corner, then calmly gathered, boarded the sailboats they had come on, and returned safely.</p>
<p>That day, over forty Japanese soldiers were annihilated, two light machine guns, over twenty rifles, and countless other spoils of war were seized. Among the rescue corps members, two bravely disregarded their own safety, resulting in heroic sacrifice. The annihilated Japanese soldiers belonged to a detachment of the "Sasebo Marine Corps Great Western Unit Second Company." The next morning, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Houpu, upon hearing the news, was ashamed and indignant. So, he sent troops to rescue on one hand and wired Xiamen for help on the other hand. However, when the Japanese troops from Xiamen and Houpu arrived one after another, they could only collect the remains of the Japanese soldiers, fire cannons at Dadeng and Xiaodeng to vent their anger.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Ningbo Temporarily Suspends Navigation; Japan Blocks Foreign Ships from Sailing to Fujian and Wenzhou; British and American Authorities Firmly Refuse; Japan Must Take Responsibility If Civilians Are Endangered; Transportation Between Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Wenzhou Is Cut Off <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>External News: The British authorities have refused the Japanese demand that British ships and British nationals withdraw from Fuzhou and Wenzhou. According to British officials, both places are commercial ports, and Britain naturally has the right to make full use of them. In the event that Japanese military actions endanger the lives and property of British nationals in those two places, the responsibility should be borne by Japan.</p>
<p>External News: Regarding the Japanese deadline for American ships in Fuzhou and Wenzhou to leave immediately and for American nationals to evacuate entirely by the 29th, it is now known that the commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Yarnell, intends to send a reply to the Japanese refusing the demand. The wording is the same as the reply refusing the Japanese demand in Shantou.</p>
<p>Since the fall of Dinghai, the Ningbo military authorities, in order to consolidate defenses, have decided to re-prohibit foreign ships from sailing. The Der Ping, Mou Fu, and New Peking ships all left Ningbo yesterday morning and arrived in Shanghai that evening. However, there is a rumor that the Mou Fu ship has been permitted to continue sailing one more trip. In Wenzhou, foreign merchants were suddenly notified by the Japanese to obstruct foreign ships from entering the Ou River, causing the Ma Le En De, Bao Li, Fei Kang, and other ships to turn back to Shanghai midway. The Taikoo's Yingzhou, Liangzhou, and other ships have changed their route to Hong Kong. Details are explored below:</p>
<p>Ships from Ningbo Sail to Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the fall of Dinghai, Ningbo has become tense because of its proximity. Shipping circles in the city have been widely rumored that the Yong River would be re-closed to navigation. Until now, it has been learned that the Ningbo Defense Command has decided to temporarily prohibit navigation in order to strengthen the defense of the Zhenhai Estuary. A shipping company in the city, not having received an official telegram, sent a telegram the day before yesterday afternoon inquiring, saying, "Heard Ningbo will close navigation, is it true? Hope for a reply." Subsequently, at 8:00 PM that evening, a reply telegram was received from Ningbo stating, "Telegram received, prohibition of navigation is true, all ships staying in Ningbo are scheduled to sail to Shanghai on the morning of the 27th." Therefore, the news of the prohibition of navigation has been confirmed. All foreign ships staying in Ningbo, such as the De Ping of Sino-Italian, the Mou Fu of Lihe, and the New Peking of Taikoo, left Ningbo before 6:00 AM yesterday morning and sailed to Shanghai, arriving in Shanghai one after another at around 7:00 PM that evening. However, according to news from the German merchant Lihe Yangxing, the Mou Fu ship of the company has been specially approved by the Ningbo authorities and may continue sailing one more trip. But whether it can sail depends on the decision in the Ningbo telegram.</p>
<p>Gap Unfilled</p>
<p>According to news from shipping circles yesterday, the closure of the Zhenhai Estuary this time is entirely for the purpose of consolidating the defenses of the fortress and is of the same nature as before. If the situation eases, it is hoped that it will be opened immediately. Therefore, the gap in the blockade line left for navigation will not be filled. The old Taiping ship, reserved to be sunk as a blockage, is still berthed at the Zhenhai China Merchants Bureau wharf and will not be sunk unless absolutely necessary. Because if it is blocked, it will be very difficult to open it in the future.</p>
<p>Two Ships Dock in Ningbo</p>
<p>The Gaodeng ship of the German merchant Lu Lin Yangxing, which travels the Ningbo-Dinghai route, sailed from Ningbo to Dinghai on the 23rd. Because of the war there, it went straight to Shipu and has now returned to Ningbo from Shipu. Because Dinghai's transportation is blocked, it has decided to suspend navigation and dock in Ningbo temporarily. The Tianbao ship of the German merchant Shi Yide Yangxing is also temporarily docked and suspended. A decision on the route will be made after the Yong River is opened.</p>
<p>Japanese Obstruction</p>
<p>After the Japanese troops landed in Dinghai, they attempted to invade Zhenhai and the Ou River fortress. Yesterday morning, according to news from shipping circles, several Japanese warships were anchored outside the mouth of the Ou River, and aircraft were flying around. The German merchant John Mahler's ship was suddenly blocked from entering the Huanghua Customs Gate when it sailed out of the harbor yesterday morning. The ship had no choice but to turn back. At the same time, the Japanese naval authorities also notified foreign merchants, saying that the Japanese military would take action in the Ou River and Min Sea, and advised foreign merchant ships not to sail into the ports of Zhejiang and Fujian. Otherwise, if damage occurs, the Japanese side will not be responsible.</p>
<p>En De Turns Back</p>
<p>The Sino-Italian Company's En De ship was originally scheduled to sail directly to Ningbo on the afternoon of the 26th, but upon receiving news of the Ningbo navigation ban, it temporarily changed its course to Wenzhou yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, it suddenly received news of the Japanese obstruction yesterday morning, so it radioed the En De ship to return to Shanghai. After receiving the company's telegram, the ship turned back midway and entered the harbor at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. The Fei Kang ship of the German merchant Lu Lin Yangxing and the Shi Li Yu ship of the Italian merchant Hua Yi Yangxing also sailed to Wenzhou at 7:00 AM yesterday morning, but both turned back midway. The Liangzhou and Yingzhou ships of the Taikoo Company have decided to change their route to Hong Kong. The Hana ship of the German merchant Far East Company left Wenzhou and returned to Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday morning, and the Haifu ship of Lihe Yangxing arrived in Shanghai last night. Whether it can sail depends on the situation.</p>
<p>Japanese Attempt to Invade Chuanshan</p>
<p>Chuanshan is southwest of Dinghai, separated by a harbor two hours away by boat. It belongs to Zhenhai County and can be reached by land to Ningbo. Since the fall of Dinghai, the authorities have been stepping up preparations in the area to strengthen defenses and strictly guard against invasion. The harbor there is extremely narrow and the waterway is quite shallow, so Japanese warships cannot approach. Moreover, both sides are mountainous, and the Chinese side has strong fortifications and gun emplacements, so the defenses are extremely solid. According to a telegram received by shipping circles from Ningbo yesterday afternoon, over 300 Japanese soldiers, covered by three Japanese warships, attempted to land at Chuanshan yesterday morning. They were fiercely attacked by the local water police team, and the Japanese troops were wounded and retreated without success. However, the situation there is still extremely tense.</p>
<p>Destroying Highways</p>
<p>All coastal highways in eastern Zhejiang have been destroyed one after another due to military reasons, such as the Wenzhou to Qingtian section, the Ningbo to Cao'e section, the Cao'e to Xiaoshan section, the Ningbo to Chuanshan section, and the Jiangkou to Xikou section. The Ningbo Defense Commander has recently ordered the Fenghua and Xinchang County governments and the Yin-Feng Long-Distance Bus Company to prepare to continue the destruction upon orders. It is said that when necessary, all highways in Zhejiang Province will be destroyed at any time as required by military needs. Currently, the Lishui-Jinhua section via Yongkang and the Jinhua-Lanxi Longhai-Quzhou section are still open to traffic temporarily.</p>
<p>Situation in Zhoushan</p>
<p>According to reports from refugees who arrived in Shanghai from the Zhoushan Islands by sailboat, Shenjiamen in Dinghai was constantly bombed by six Japanese planes and shelled by Japanese warships on the morning of the 21st, causing considerable damage to the area. Subsequently, Japanese troops landed, and although the Self-Defense Corps and others resisted fiercely, they were ultimately defeated by the superior enemy and fell. It is said that the fall of Dinghai County Town was after Shenjiamen. Now, the Self-Defense Corps and others, led by County Magistrate Su, have retreated to the Qingling area to carry out guerrilla warfare and inflict heavy damage on the Japanese troops at any time. As for the residents, they have all withdrawn to the deep mountains in the suburbs, and the county town has become a ghost town.</p>
<p>Japanese Note</p>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening News reported that, according to news released by the Shanghai Consular Body, the Japanese naval authorities declared this morning (26th) that military action would begin today against the coastal ports of Fuzhou and Wenzhou in Chinese hands, and requested that all foreign warships and merchant ships in the two places withdraw to designated areas by noon on Friday. Nationals of third countries residing in the two cities should evacuate as quickly as possible. The note delivered by the Japanese Navy to the Consular Body stated that after the above time, ships still anchored in the two ports may suffer direct or indirect losses, and the Japanese authorities will not be responsible. As of noon today, Shanghai had not received news of the Japanese declaration of military action against Fuzhou and Wenzhou. Fuzhou is the provincial capital of Fujian Province, recently relocated, and Wenzhou is a port in Zhejiang Province near the Fujian border, and is also the most important gateway for Chinese forces to enter the interior.</p>
<p>Ever since the Japanese troops landed in Shantou, the two cities have been quite tense. The Shanghai-Ningbo direct航綫, which had just resumed on Monday, has now been suspended. After the Japanese Navy occupied Zhoushan Island, Zhenhai and Ningbo will be invaded by Japanese troops at any time. It is believed that the Japanese troops will use the island as a base for invading Zhenhai and Ningbo, thereby completing their blockade of the Chinese coast. The Japanese military sent the following note to the Consular Body requesting foreign ships and foreign nationals to withdraw from Fuzhou and Wenzhou:</p>
<p>(1) On June 27, 1939, the Japanese Navy will begin military operations against Fuzhou and Wenzhou. Therefore, please have all third-country warships and merchant ships anchored in Wenzhou sail to the sea east of 112.15 degrees east longitude and those anchored in Fuzhou sail to 119.50 degrees east longitude before noon (Japanese time) on the 29th. For military needs, from the above time, the entrances to the two ports will be blocked with dangerous materials and other obstacles, so ships will not be able to enter or leave the two ports. After the above time, ships remaining anchored in the two ports may suffer direct or indirect losses, and the Japanese authorities will not be responsible. (2) Since the area near Wenzhou and Fuzhou will become a combat zone, please have the nationals of third countries residing in these areas evacuate as soon as possible.</p>
<p>British Authorities</p>
<p>are responding to this warning in the same way as the Shantou warning, stating that the Japanese side is responsible for not interfering with the actions of British ships or endangering the lives and property of British citizens. The British government cannot accept this warning as a means for the Japanese side to shirk its above-mentioned responsibility, because British ships, including warships, have the right to sail to any point on Chinese waters and to anchor in all commercial ports, and the right of British citizens to reside near Wenzhou and Fuzhou is not affected.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Approved Tram Fare Increase by the Shanghai Municipal Council: First Class: National Currency 3.1 Cents Per Mile, Third Class: National Currency 2.15 Cents Per Mile – An Increase of Approximately 16.6% Over the Original Price <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tramways Company submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Council in April of this year to approve an increase in fares. It is noted that the company's last fare increase was implemented in June 1933. The fares set at that time, after being converted to national currency at the average exchange rate in March 1937, were equivalent to 2.67 cents of national currency per mile for first class and 1.84 cents of national currency per mile for third class. According to the contract between the company and the Shanghai Municipal Council, there was a clause stipulating that the maximum fare would be 10 cents per mile for first class and 5 cents per mile for third class.</p>
<p>Decline in Exchange Rates, Increased Costs</p>
<p>The company stated that the proposed fare increase was necessitated by the sharp decline in the exchange rate of the national currency and the significant increase in operating costs in the year prior to April of this year, making it unavoidable. The Public Utilities Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council discussed this matter in detail on May 19 of this year.</p>
<p>Public Utilities Committee Approved</p>
<p>Some committee members stated that the most important factor to consider regarding this proposal was the company's financial situation and whether an increase in fares was necessary. It was jointly decided that the increase in operating costs and the proposed fare increase did not exceed the contract limits. Others stated that the proposed fare increase of 16.6% over the original price was reasonable and that, according to the company's business charter established on October 10, 1930, the company seemed to have the right to increase fares to the maximum limit without the need for approval from the Council. Subsequently, the committee resolved to seek legal advice regarding the authority issue. As for the proposed fares, the majority of the committee members approved them.</p>
<p>Expected Revenue After the Price Increase</p>
<p>According to the legal advice obtained by the Shanghai Municipal Council afterward, the Tramways Company, based on its business charter, could increase fares to the maximum limit. Regarding the company's income and expenditure situation, the Chief of the Finance Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council conducted a detailed investigation and reported to the Board of Directors. The Chief stated that, to his knowledge, the expected increase in revenue after the Tramways Company implemented the price increase would only be able to offset 80% of the increased expenses.</p>
<p>Tramways Company Statement</p>
<p>At a meeting held last month, the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors submitted the recommendations of the Public Utilities Committee, along with the opinions and detailed reports of the Chief of the Finance Department, for review. It was decided to instruct the Chief of the Finance Department to write to the Tramways Company again to inquire about various facts and figures in order to determine whether the proposed fare increase was justified. The company then replied to the Chief of the Finance Department, stating that the company had always adopted a business policy of charging low fees to cater to the public. The large number of tram passengers showed that the public agreed with the company's fares. Since the last fare increase, the company's operating costs have increased significantly. In the past two months, the exchange rate of British gold has risen from 7 and 32/7 pence to 7 and a half pence, further increasing expenses. The company did not want to increase the burden on passengers, as an excessive fare increase would reduce the number of passengers, which would be detrimental to the company's interests.</p>
<p>Tram Fares in Various British Cities</p>
<p>The proposed revised fares, when converted at an exchange rate of one national currency yuan to six and a half British pence, would be 20% of one penny per mile for first class and 14% of one penny per mile for third class. In comparison, the tram fares per mile in Birmingham, Liverpool, and Manchester in the United Kingdom are 65%, 50%, and 72% of one penny, respectively. The company had carefully considered the fare increase, which is why it had been delayed until now before implementing it. At the same time, the company submitted a report on its assets, liabilities, income, and expenditure for the past six years.</p>
<p>Approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors</p>
<p>After reviewing the above documents, the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors raised the Tramways Company's request for discussion again on the 14th of this month. The directors all believed that the proposed revised fares were fair and reasonable, and they unanimously resolved to approve the company's increase of the average fare to 3.11 cents of national currency per mile for first class and 2.15 cents of national currency per mile for third class.</p>
<p>New Fares to Be Implemented Tomorrow</p>
<p>According to a news agency, the Shanghai Tramways Company has recently decided to revise its ticket prices due to the decline in exchange rates and high expenses. It is now learned that the company has finalized the new fares and will officially announce them tomorrow (the 29th), posting them on all vehicles. Passengers will also be required to pay the new fares when riding.</p>

<p>The Japanese Consulate-General in Nanjing invited Japanese and puppet personnel to a banquet on the 10th of this month. During the banquet, someone secretly placed poison in the wine, resulting in the poisoning of many Japanese and puppet personnel. As a result, two secretaries from the consulate, Miyashita and Funayama, died despite efforts to save them. Their bodies have been transported to Shanghai. At 9 a.m. yesterday, the coffins were carried onto the Japanese ship "Shanghai Maru," which set sail from the Huishan Wharf in Hongkou to return to Japan. At the time, a large number of Japanese and puppet personnel were at the wharf, holding half-masts to hold a send-off ceremony. The surrounding area was guarded by Japanese soldiers to prevent accidents, and the situation was quite tense.</p>

<p>Evaluation Price for Receiving Transfers</p>
<p>It is stipulated that member banks and money exchanges of the Silver and Money Exchange Association, as well as member banks of the Bank Joint Reserve Committee, note exchange banks, and trust companies, can provide property, including major goods, corporate bonds, stocks, real estate in the concession, etc., to the Bank Joint Reserve Committee to receive inter-bank transfers. The committee will evaluate the prices and issue transfer certificates. The evaluation committee members are divided into real estate shares, securities and stock shares, and goods shares. The committee members are appointed by Chinese and foreign experts.</p>
<p>Formation of Inspection Committee to Handle Registration</p>
<p>The Inter-Bank Transfer Preparation Inspection Committee is jointly organized by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Foreign Banks Association, the Bankers Association, and the Money Exchange Association, each sending one representative, and the Sino-Central-Jiaotong-Nong four banks jointly sending one representative. The association has already sent letters to the above organizations and the four banks to promptly send representatives. The task is to inspect the collateral provided by the banks and money exchanges for receiving the transfer. At the same time, the association has started handling the registration of inter-bank transfer receipts, which will be implemented on July 4th.</p>
<p>Transfer Deposits Converted into Legal Tender</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance allowed the Sino-Central-Jiaotong-Nong four banks to provide silver and money exchanges with legal tender as much as possible, it is reported that the Bank Joint Reserve Committee has reached an agreement with the Sino-Central-Jiaotong-Nong four banks. The 22 million yuan of transfer deposits originally deposited by the silver and money exchanges in the Bank Joint Reserve and the Money Exchange Reserve will be converted into legal tender by the Bank Joint Reserve at 95% starting from July 4th, in twelve weeks, to facilitate turnover. It is reported that the association has notified the banks and money exchanges that hold the deposits.</p>
<p>Increased Chips Beneficial to All Industries</p>
<p>A reporter from New Sound News learned from the silver and money exchanges yesterday that after the bank's semi-annual settlement, two types of chips have been added to the Shanghai market: one is a new transfer chip with definite collateral, and the other is the transfer of existing deposits in warehouses, which has become a legal tender chip. Although the new transfer method is a new chip in Shanghai, it can prevent the market from feeling a lack of chips, which is very beneficial to industry and commerce. At the same time, it can make the entire financial market more stable and reduce improper speculation.</p>
<p>Collateral is Reliable and Circulates in the Market</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of silver and money exchanges issuing 50 million yuan of new transfer chips, a reporter from New New News visited Mr. Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Bankers Association, yesterday. He said that the Bank Joint Reserve Committee is determined to handle the issuance of new inter-bank transfers for various banks and money exchanges entirely to regulate inter-bank funds and meet the needs of industry and commerce. All receiving banks and money exchanges must provide reliable property as collateral, and the transfer received must not exceed 70% of the evaluated value of the collateral, so as to ensure that the collateral is sufficient. The transfers can be used as chips for transactions and transfers in industry and commerce, circulate in the market, and can be transferred inland to purchase local goods.</p>
<p>Issuing Circulating Notes is Absolutely Not Accurate</p>
<p>The silver and money exchanges' reserve fund is allowed to exchange inter-bank transfer deposits for legal tender and handle inter-bank receipts of transfers, all of which are scheduled to be implemented after the semi-annual settlement holiday, that is, from July 4th. Therefore, the legal tender chips in Shanghai can be increased by 22 million yuan and 50 million yuan of new transfer certificates, totaling 72 million yuan. In addition, the number of legal tender and transfers currently circulating in the market is also quite large. In the future, the turnover of chips for banks and money exchanges themselves and for industry and commerce will not be lacking. The rumor that the authorities will issue circulating notes due to restrictions on deposits and withdrawals and a shortage of legal tender has been confirmed by authoritative sources in the financial community to be absolutely inaccurate.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily reported that the Overseas Telegraph Company and newspapers were calling for news稿件 from Tianjin. The North China city had become the number one news source in the world. More news about this matter was being released from China daily than was being released from Shanghai during the most intense fighting around Shanghai in September 1937. The increasing tension in Tianjin has caused well-known news reporters to quickly leave this city. Miles, the Far East General Manager of the Associated Press, went to the blockaded city last week. Steele of the Chicago Daily News, after arriving here from India, rushed to Tianjin last Saturday. Kane, a reporter for the New York Herald Tribune, also left Shanghai by train for the north last Sunday.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Japanese Warships Bombard to Provide Cover: Intense Fighting in Xingang <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Troops Bravely Repel Japanese Troops, Who Retreat to Their Ships: Swire &amp; Co. Decides to Suspend the North Shasa Route</p>
<p>For days, the Japanese Navy has been sending warships to bombard various ports in Haiqi County in an attempt to cover the landings and hinder the passage of foreign ships. Swire &amp; Co., a British company, has decided to suspend the North Shasa route. Foreign ships sailing today will temporarily not call at Xingang and other places. The details are as follows, as reported by a reporter from Dagong News Agency:</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Continue to Bombard Xingang</p>
<p>A Japanese small shallow-water gunboat, No. 32, arrived at Erlishu waters outside Xingang Port the day before yesterday (the 26th) and continued to bombard the shore to cover two motorboats carrying more than 30 soldiers, equipped with machine guns, rifles, and other weapons, in an attempt to land. When the Japanese soldiers on the boats approached the port, they fired with machine guns and rifles. The Chinese troops on the shore immediately returned fire. For a time, the sound of cannons was deafening, bullets flew everywhere, and the fighting was intense. As a result of the battle, due to the tight defense of the Chinese troops, the Japanese troops retreated to their ships, and the landing attempt still failed.</p>
<p>Ships Sailing to North Shasa Are Blocked from Sailing</p>
<p>The Wantong Wheel of the British Swire &amp; Co., the Haiyi Wheel of the German Far East Co., and the Jiangding Wheel of the Fuhua Co., all sailing on the North Shasa route, sailed out on the morning of the 26th. At about 2 p.m., they arrived near Xingang and were spotted by Japanese warships, which immediately signaled them to stop and blocked them from advancing. The Haiyi and Jiangding wheels then sailed back to Qinglong Port and dropped anchor. The Wantong wheel, protected by the British warship "Mosquito," sailed with it to Xingang and anchored. Although it sounded its whistle, the boatmen did not dare to risk going out of the port to pick up passengers. At about 5 a.m. yesterday morning, when the Wantong wheel sailed to Lingdian Port, it suddenly discovered two Japanese motorboats following closely behind the ship, firing guns at the shore. The ship stopped. At about 10 a.m., when the Japanese motorboats left, it sailed straight to Sanhe and docked. The boatmen risked going out of the port and unloaded passengers and goods. Only a dozen passengers took the ship from the port to Shanghai. A small number of passengers on the Haiyi and Jiangding wheels disembarked at Qinglong Port, and the majority of the passengers and cargo were brought back to Shanghai by the original ships. All the ships arrived in Shanghai at around 3 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>Japanese Consulate Notifies Wantong to Suspend Navigation</p>
<p>At the request of the naval authorities, the Japanese Consulate notified the British Consulate yesterday that there were military operations in the lower ports of North Shasa and that all ships were prohibited from sailing. The British Consulate informed the British Swire &amp; Co. accordingly. A reporter from Dagong News Agency learned that the company has temporarily suspended the Wantong wheel's voyage on the North Shasa route and will decide whether to resume the voyage depending on the situation.</p>
<p>German Ships Still Operate, Do Not Call at Upper Ports</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Dagong News Agency who inquired last night, the Haiyi wheel of the German Far East Co. and the Jiangding wheel of the Fuhua Co. will still sail to Shuji Hong, Niuhong Port, and Hutong Port as usual at 7 a.m. this morning. However, if they are blocked by Japanese warships, they will temporarily take Qinglong Port as the end point and will not call at Xingang, Lingdian Port, Sanhe Port, and other upper ports. Since the Anti-Japanese War, passengers and goods in northern Jiangsu have been transported through the above three ports. If they are blocked by the Japanese army, the daily necessities in this city will be slightly affected.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Rumor That Japanese Troops Landed in Minjiang River: No Telegrams Received in Shanghai: Shenfu Wheel Scheduled to Arrive in Fuzhou Yesterday, Niuzhuang Wheel Temporarily Changed Its Route <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>After Hong Kong telegrams reported that the Japanese Navy had landed at the Jianfeng area of ​​Minjiang River in Fujian yesterday morning, a reporter from New Sound News inquired from the shipping industry yesterday, but no telegrams were received from Fuzhou. It was found that the Minjiang River in Fuzhou had already been blocked, and the blockade line was at the Mawei in Minjiang River. Therefore, all foreign ships sailing to Fuzhou were anchored at Panshi outside Mawei. Mawei is the only military port, with new-style fortresses and defense works.</p>
<p>No Telegrams from Fujian Shipping Companies to Confirm</p>
<p>The British Yilong Co.'s Shenfu wheel loaded goods in Shanghai and sailed to Fuzhou on the 25th of this month, scheduled to arrive in Fuzhou yesterday. However, as of last night, the Shanghai company had not received a telegram from the wheel or from the Fuzhou branch. Therefore, the rumor of the Japanese army landing was considered difficult to confirm.</p>
<p>Niuzhuang Wheel Changed to Directly Release to Haifang</p>
<p>The British Swire Co.'s Liangzhou and Niuzhuang wheels were originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to the newly opened Xiudu, Linqiu, and Sanjiang ports near Xinghua, Quanzhou, and Xiangyu in Fujian Province this morning. Yesterday morning, there were rumors that the Japanese army had landed near the Minjiang River. After learning of the above news, Swire Co. changed the route of the Niuzhuang wheel and changed it to directly release to Haifang on the morning of the 30th (Saturday).</p>
<p>Xiudu Route Temporarily Takes a Wait-and-See Approach</p>
<p>As for the Liangzhou wheel, which was originally scheduled to sail to Xiudu (Hsintu) (i.e., Xiudu near Quanzhou) this morning, the passengers and goods that had been booked yesterday were being loaded. Because the route was difficult to change for a while, for safety reasons, we will wait and see for another day today. If there are no major changes, we will prepare to export tomorrow morning and try to sail to Xiudu.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Situation in North China Gradually Tense: British and American Flagships Concentrated: American Ship O克斯泰 Arrived in Yantai, British Ship Kant is Rushing North <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>After the Tianjin Concession was blockaded, the situation in North China suddenly became tense. Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the US Asian Fleet, had already taken the flagship 奥古斯泰號 from Qinhuangdao to Yantai on the 26th. The British warship "邓肯" also sailed from Qinhuangdao to Yantai on the same day following the American ship 奥古斯泰號. It is also learned that the reason why the British warships sailed to Yantai was due to the request of the British Consul in Yantai, because the anti-British incidents there were on the rise. Also, the British Far East giant ten-thousand-ton flagship "坎特" (KENT) departed from Singapore for China on the evening of the 26th and is currently en route to North China. It is said that it will go to Yantai for concentration. Admiral Noble, Commander of the British Far East Fleet, may still remain in Singapore to meet with Australian Naval Minister Goree, so the date of his return to China will be delayed accordingly. The "坎特" is equipped with eight 8-inch guns.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily reported that when Jardine Matheson's Chun Sheng wheel berthed in Qingdao last week, longshoremen instigated by the Japanese displayed a portrait of British Prime Minister Chamberlain, shouting "Down with Chamberlain" and "Resist British Goods," causing the wheel to be unable to unload and stay in Qingdao for four days. This was told to the reporter by Captain Kegongks when the Chun Sheng wheel arrived here yesterday (26th) at noon. The dockworkers also held a mass rally and demonstration, severely criticizing Britain and the British, and used a portrait of Chamberlain to arouse greater excitement. During the four days, whenever coolies were hired to unload goods for the Chun Sheng wheel, someone would persuade them to unload goods for the Japanese wheel. It is also learned that the Taikoo Co.'s Shengjing wheel returned here from Tianjin and other ports in North China at 6:30 a.m. yesterday morning. It is said that the wheel was not obstructed by the Japanese.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Scarce Arrivals, Slack Sales: Total Rice Stockpile Unchanged: Decrease in Stockpile is Due to Citizens' Scattered Hoarding of Rice: Rice Management Committee Held Another Meeting Yesterday to Discuss <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The Concession authorities have repeatedly taken measures to stabilize the people's food and curb the rise in prices within the Concession, and have sent detectives to intervene. Rice prices have fallen slightly. Now, the Concession Rice Management Committee, in order to stabilize people's hearts, convened a committee meeting at 2 p.m. yesterday. It is reported that the result of the discussion can be divided into the following three points: 1. To stabilize the people's hearts in the market, it is necessary to dredge the source of national rice. 2. Send personnel to the market to persuade each other to buy and sell at the limited price according to the license. 3. Reward the Bang merchants and encourage them to purchase national rice and transport it to Shanghai for regulation. It is reported that rice sales have been slack in recent days.</p>
<p>Although Stockpiles Have Decreased, There is No Shortage of Food</p>
<p>A reporter from New Sound News learned from the Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association yesterday that the 13th rice stockpile survey was released yesterday. The total rice stockpile in the city's rice warehouses was 436,427 bags, a decrease of 87,395 bags compared to last week. According to rice industry news, the reason for the decrease in the stockpile of more than 80,000 bags is that citizens rushed to buy and hoard rice during the recent surge in rice prices. Although the current stockpile has decreased, there is no shortage of food for the whole people, because the rice stored in the rice shops and the rice hoarded by the citizens is estimated to be around 50 to 60 million bags.</p>

<p>Jin Yushu, a former accountant of the Nanliang Deseguo Foreign Company, successively embezzled public funds amounting to 24,350 yuan and fled.

Recently, detectives from the Old Zhabei Police Station arrested Jin and escorted him to the First Special Court. Due to the issue of jurisdiction, the First Special Court requested instructions from the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court. Now the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court has ruled that the First Special Court has jurisdiction. Therefore, yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefei opened a criminal court to interrogate him. The lawyer of the Police Station, Ru Bao Yi, prosecuted him for embezzlement. The defendant had no objection to the prosecution's claims and requested a judgment according to law. The lawyer representing Deseguo stated that Jin Yushu had already returned 5,000 yuan, so the incidental civil suit should be corrected to 19,350 yuan and the statutory 5% interest until the date of execution, etc. Judge Xiao sentenced Jin Yushu to two years and six months of imprisonment and ordered him to return 19,350 yuan of national currency to the plaintiff, and 5% interest until the date of execution.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association received a letter from the Chinese International Library in Geneva yesterday: "We are writing to inform you that our library was established in Geneva, the international center. Its main purpose is to promote national glory and enhance China's international status. For six years, we have spared no effort in providing books, exhibiting calligraphy and paintings, distributing magazines, and holding lectures, and the results have been great. Last autumn, we expanded our plan and organized a Museum Department to become a parallel institution with the existing library, so that our country's cultural relics can be permanently displayed overseas to promote Westerners' understanding of us and change their past misconceptions about our race. Since the Anti-Japanese War, we have stepped up our publicity. In view of the popularity of Japanese goods in Europe and the United States, we think there must be a way to control them. We have set up a National Products Department to promote our national products in Europe and the West, so that Westerners can distinguish the exquisiteness of our Chinese goods, which are far superior to Japanese goods, so as to increase the efficiency of our country's international trade. Reading the newspaper, we know that your association is holding a National Products Exhibition in Shanghai. We admire your grand plans. We are thinking, if your association could collect a copy for our library at the same time, regardless of the nature or category, and display them separately with explanations for publicity purposes, it would be beneficial to both the public and private sectors. If you agree to this, it would not only be a blessing for our library, but also for the future of our motherland's foreign trade. Please divide each item into small packages and send them to our library as samples. If the weight is too large and you need to pack them in large boxes, to avoid taxes, please send them to the office of our country's League of Nations representative, stating that you are forwarding them to our library. Please consider and reply."</p>

<p>Wang Xingbao, a Taoist priest, 31 years old, residing at No. 147 Li Mei Road, on the 22nd of this month at 5:30 AM, gathered Qiu Sanzi, a Jiangbei native, and the fugitive nicknamed "Rotten Wood," carrying a pistol and two sharp blades, and went to the home of the blind fortune teller Wang Wenlong at No. 46 Li Mei Road to commit robbery. They robbed nine pieces of clothing. Unsatisfied, Wang Xingbao sent Wang an intimidating letter on the 24th, demanding 500 yuan and setting the time for negotiation at 7 AM the next day at Gansu Road in the Public Concession. After receiving the letter, Wang sent Shao Linfu as a representative to negotiate with the bandits on the one hand, and reported it to the French police on the other. Inspector Li Xianyang, detectives Zhou Bingcheng, Wang Dongwan, Zhou Qingfang, Yang Jiaxue, and others disguised themselves and accompanied Shao. Upon arriving at the designated location, they found the Taoist priest Wang standing by the roadside, seemingly waiting. Shao pretended to negotiate with Wang, and the bandit Qiu also staggered over. The detectives rushed forward, captured the two bandits, and took them to the police station for investigation. Yesterday, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for trial by Judge Zhang Minsheng. The police requested an extension of the hearing because the case was not yet fully investigated. After a brief interrogation, the court ordered a rescheduling for further trial.</p>

<p>Liu Gendi, a woman from Yixing (18 years old), lost both parents at a young age and was impoverished. She came to Shanghai this spring to find work in a yarn factory but was unsuccessful. She stayed at the Rue de Saigon Refugee Shelter. Recently, the shelter closed down, and Liu had nowhere to live, becoming a beggar, sleeping in the alleys. Later, two elderly women who were previously at the shelter took her to a brothel at No. 8 Zhifu Road, opened by Hu Peizhen from Zhenjiang and her concubine Wang Guibao from Changzhou, forcing her into prostitution. For about ten days, Liu suffered from urinary problems, and the procuress Wang Guibao ordered the ruffians Jin Linbao from Shaoxing and Jin Asan from Ningbo to take her to Shi Shiquan, a fellow villager and owner of Zhengji Teahouse on Xiaoshadu Road, on the 20th at 8:30 PM. The two Jins took the opportunity to extort Shi, falsely accusing him of introducing Liu to Wang Guibao's brothel to become a prostitute, demanding 200 yuan to settle the matter. The case was exposed, and the police from Putuo Road dispatched Chinese detective Tan Jinhai to arrest the two Jins. After learning the details, he went to No. 8 Zhifu Road to arrest the two brothel owners, Hu and Wang, and sent them all to the First Special District Court. After the interrogation, Judge Jiang Shuzi of the Third Criminal Court sentenced Hu Peizhen and Wang Guibao to two years and six months each, and Jin Linbao and Jin Asan to six months each, as a warning.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily reports that yesterday (the 26th), a Japanese newspaper in this city reported that two more Japanese nationals, involved in a transaction related to opium sales rights, have been ordered to be expelled by the Japanese military authorities. One of them, Shibata, 49, came to Shanghai from Tainan, Taiwan, in April. If the deal had gone through, Shibata could have made a profit of 30,000 Japanese yen.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Wang Jiasun and His Brother Falsely Accuse Xu Maochang, Police File Public Prosecution <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Xu Maochang, a wealthy Ningbo merchant in Shanghai, has been involved in lawsuits in recent years. Initially, he was accused by Viennese dancer Jiang Yuzhen of seduction and abandonment, and was also implicated in the yarn exchange scandal. More recently, he has been sued in civil and criminal cases in the First Special District Court, and a lawsuit involving adultery with a Ms. Yang has turned into a family scandal. Thus, Xu has been spending his days dealing with lawsuits. Now, a dispute has arisen with Wang Jiasun and Wang Jiatong, directors of the Chengji Real Estate Company.</p>
<p>The Background of the Conflict: Wang Yang'an, the father of Wang Jiasun and Wang Jiatong, and Xu Qingyun, the father of Xu Maochang, were both from the same hometown and were friends. Xu Qingyun's Henglai Money Exchange, located in Xingren Lane, Ningbo Road, has now declared bankruptcy, and both Xu Qingyun and Wang Yang'an have passed away. Recently, Xu Maochang suddenly claimed that Wang Yang'an had invested 30,000 yuan in Henglai Money Exchange when he was alive, but did not come forward. Therefore, Wang Yang'an's successors, Wang Jiasun and Wang Jiatong, should also bear the</p>
<p>Responsibility for the Debt</p>
<p>and brought the matter to the Wang brothers. The Wang brothers denied any knowledge that their ancestor had invested 30,000 yuan in Henglai and refused to take responsibility. Thus, the dispute arose. On the 20th of this month, Wang Jiasun, representing Wang Jiatong, reported to the Old Gate Police Station, stating that Xu Maochang, on the morning of the 19th around 11:00 AM, had led four or five people to the Chengji Real Estate Company at No. 457 Hankou Road, threatened them with a pistol, and robbed 30 account books, requesting investigation. After</p>
<p>Investigation by</p>
<p>Chinese detective Tao Rubi and Western detective, Xu Maochang claimed that the account books were taken from Wang Jiatong's house at No. 557 Route des Soeurs, were voluntarily handed over, and that a receipt was issued by the accompanying lawyer Zhang Zhiguo, and that there was no pistol threat. The detectives determined that the Wang brothers had made a false accusation and petitioned the First Special District Court to</p>
<p>Issue a Summons.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xieffen opened the First Criminal Court to summon them. Wang Jiatong, due to illness, sent lawyer Liu Shifang to court to make a statement, while Wang Jiasun surrendered himself. Police lawyer Ru Bao-yi stated the details of the case and prosecuted the two Wangs for the crime of false accusation under Article 169 of the Criminal Law, stating that since the defendant Wang Jiatong had not appeared in court, the case could not be concluded immediately and requested a postponement. After Judge Xiao interrogated Xu Maochang and Wang Jiasun, he ordered a postponement for further interrogation.</p>

<p>Sun Achang, a 52-year-old from Shaoxing, had committed offenses multiple times in the past. Recently, he worked as an assistant in a brothel at No. 8 Qunyufang, Shantou Road, and thus became acquainted with Gong Caidi (25 years old), the landlady of Yunniang's bookshop at No. 22 Huile Lane, Sima Road. On the 1st of this month, Sun Achang suddenly had inappropriate thoughts and, impersonating a Mr. Yang, sent a note to Gong Caidi, summoning her to Room 504 of the Zhongnan Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. Using threats, he forced her to live with him. When she refused, he robbed her of a gold bracelet worth over 200 yuan. After the report, detective Zhang Bingchun was dispatched to arrest Sun and send him to the First Special Court. After the interrogation, Judge Xiao sentenced Sun to one year and two months in prison yesterday.</p>

<p>Wan Chen Sauce Garden was formerly located at the intersection of Xujiahui Road and Lujiawan. On April 22nd of this year, Li Runshen, the shareholder and manager of the garden, convened a meeting of the partners, reporting losses and difficulties in maintaining operations. It was resolved to entrust accountant Fei Zutai to liquidate the accounts. Recently, Li Runshen and others hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution with the Second Special District Court against Zhang Qiuhua, the manager of the branch garden, and Chu Wenhan and other five partners, accusing them of embezzling common property. During the court hearing, Zhang Qiuhua and others appointed lawyer Li Wenjie to defend them, arguing that there were nine common partners in the garden, all using symbols as their names. They argued that Li Yansun and Li Bingsun did not have the status of partners and were not legally entitled to be plaintiffs. They further argued that the liquidation of the accounts was decided by the meeting, and the sale of property was within their duties, so it could not be considered embezzlement. Furthermore, the proceeds from the sale of goods were used to dismiss workers and pay off debts, which was a very proper purpose. The defendants claimed that the plaintiff's lawsuit was obviously for other purposes and hoped that others would be subject to criminal penalties. The defendants declared in court that they would file a counterclaim. After the court's trial, it was announced that the case was concluded and that a judgment would be delivered on the 29th.</p>

<p>Yuan Zhangshi, a Ningbo woman formerly residing on Rue de Li Mei in the French Concession, whose husband, Yuan Ade, worked as a chef for a prominent family in the National Government, took her three-year-old daughter, Lindi, to the rooftop garden of the Sincere Company on March 1st of the previous year. A tourist from Suzhou named Wang Shilin saw her alone and beautiful, and approached her. Soon, they became intimate and went to the Yuanyuan Hotel on Sima Road.</p>
<p>They Spent Time Together in a Room</p>
<p>for over ten days, becoming very fond of each other. Wang Shilin, thinking he could deceive her, used false pretenses, saying that factories in Dalian were recruiting female workers with high salaries of 160 yuan every ten days. Yuan Zhangshi was lured by the promise of money and agreed to go to Dalian. Wang Shilin conspired with Li Guozhen and his son Li Maoxin, Chen Shunhe, and others living at No. 222 Zhejiang Road, first agreeing with Liu Wenkui, who ran a brothel in Dalian, on the</p>
<p>Terms of the Sale.</p>
<p>The price was 160 yuan. Wang Shilin sent an accomplice named Qiaozhen to accompany Yuan Zhangshi on the Qingdao Maru ship. Upon arriving in Dalian, they first stayed at Liu Wenkui's house at No. 10 Li Guangsi Road for a few nights. Liu then wanted to take Yuan Zhangshi to his brothel to prostitute her. Yuan Zhangshi, upon learning this, refused firmly and was imprisoned by Liu. She escaped during a moment of opportunity and went to the Ningbo Association in Dalian, reporting it to the police, who telegraphed Yuan Ade in Shanghai, notifying him to bring his wife back. However, the</p>
<p>Three-Year-Old Daughter Lindi</p>
<p>was nowhere to be found. Yuan Ade had reported his wife and daughter's disappearance to the police, requesting an investigation. Two years later, Yuan Zhangshi ran into Wang Shilin on Avenue Edward VII and approached him, asking him to return the girl, promising not to pursue the old matter. Wang Shilin invited her to Room 54 of the Avenue Edward VII Hotel, promising to find a way. After several days passed with no news, Yuan Zhangshi reported it to the New Gate Police Station. Chinese detectives Chen Shizhong and Li Yinmin were dispatched to arrest Wang Shilin and Chen Shunhe.</p>

(Shen is 28 years old, graduated from Aurora University, and is a devout Catholic.) Unexpectedly, after the marriage, Xiang refused to consummate the marriage with her husband. From June 1st of the following year, Xiang used the excuse of returning to her maiden home, and never returned to her husband's home. Shen, although married for over four years, is still a nominal husband. Not only did Xiang not return to her husband's home, but she recently hired lawyer Wu Linkun to file for divorce in the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court, requesting the court to order her husband to pay over 40,000 yuan in alimony and other expenses. Shen hired lawyer Tang Hao to defend him, opposing the divorce. After reviewing the documents, Judge Ma Yishu determined that the fault lay with Xiang, and yesterday announced the judgment in the Civil Court.

<h3 id="e89">The Preconditions for Couples Seeking Eternal Love <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The reason why humans are considered the most intelligent of all things is that they have knowledge, emotions, and will. They do not haggle over the present but must strive for the final victory; therefore, only gambling everything on one occasion is not a high-level human behavior. When men and women of marriageable age choose a spouse, who does not carefully consider it again and again in order to seek eternal love and grow old together? As for couples whose love wanes midway, who are outwardly harmonious but inwardly estranged, who share a bed but dream different dreams, or who even litigate for divorce, it must be because either party has discovered a crisis that they cannot love each other forever, and therefore, the foundation of their marriage has shaken.</p>
<p>Let us be frank: marriage is the union of sexual relations. The reason why their foundation shakes is because their sexual life cannot be happy. In principle, the love of a couple is mutually beneficial and mutually enjoyable. Why can't it be happy? It must be caused by a pathological condition in one party's sexual function. According to medical judgments, if a man has committed masturbation and nocturnal emission in his early years, or has been promiscuous and indulgent after marriage, or if early marriage with multiple wives has consumed too much of his reproductive gland fluid, then symptoms such as premature ejaculation, impotence, underdevelopment, spermatorrhea, infertility, and neurasthenia will arise. Such husbands often feel the pain of lack of strength in their marital life. At the same time, how can a wife's enthusiasm withstand this cold destruction? Many wives' symptoms of anorgasmia, uterine congestion, hysteria, and neurasthenia arise from this. As for those with strong temperaments, they find other ways out, commit adultery, elope, and file for divorce from their husbands, which is commonplace in today's society.</p>
<p>Couples who wish to live a happy life in the paradise of eternal love must first have healthy sexual function. Therefore, smart couples must carefully maintain and cherish it. If the above symptoms occur, they must seek the most appropriate and effective treatment. According to thousands of case studies from world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, taking reproductive gland element preparations [Reproductin] (divided into male and female) is the best. Because this agent is of high quality and has accurate efficacy, the drug's effect starts one hour after taking it. In 24 hours, it will produce essence and tonify the kidneys in men, and regulate menstruation and stop leucorrhea in women. Continuing to take it for a week will promote developmental function, invigorate metabolism, strengthen the brain, and activate blood, and can completely cure the above-mentioned combined symptoms. Long-term use has the effect of prolonging life and reversing aging, so Chinese and Western doctors recommend this agent. However, male friends with spermatorrhea must also take [Hemetos' Spermatin Tablets] (available at Wuzhou, Chinese-Western-French and other large pharmacies) to stop leakage until it is stopped. It can treat both the symptoms and the root cause, and its effectiveness is faster.</p>

<p>— Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>This is not an exaggeration, nor is it an insult to women, nor is it self-flattery. We men are too tempted by women's breasts. No matter how honest and upright you are, when you take a walk in the park in the evening and see many healthy women with bare arms and legs, giggling and laughing, walking in front of you, their clothes are so thin, the curves are so obvious, and especially the towering breasts rise and fall slightly, as if nodding to you, even if you are a Liu Xiahui, in this situation and looking at this scene, I am afraid you will also be deeply moved? Therefore, Dr. Baterson, a one-dollar doctor in the United States, said in a recent book called "The Secret of Love" that a woman's breasts are the god of happiness between husband and wife, and the atoms that nurture love's seedlings. He believes that if a woman's breasts are higher and more elastic, then her reproductive gland ovary function must be strong, so her temperament will be more gentle, enthusiastic, and able to give men soaring pleasure, the so-called "just right", so the family is full of joy, and happiness is boundless! Conversely, if a woman's breasts are sagging, or even withered like a man's, it can be determined that she suffers from various unspeakable hidden diseases, and also suffers from anorgasmia and infertility. Such women have lost the beautiful curves in their posture, and make men feel tasteless in their marital life. Because of their various adverse effects, many tragedies are staged!</p>
<p>Then how can women with withered breasts seek remedy? According to the world-famous gynecologist Dr. Condelin and my experience, it is generally recognized that taking the ovarian preparation for women "Reproductin" is the most appropriate and effective. The ingredients of this agent are extracted from the ovarian essence of extremely healthy animals and prepared by scientific methods. Therefore, the medicinal properties are mild and the efficacy is great. If you continue to take it, it will not only make the withered breasts rise day by day, and the thin buttocks gradually become plump, but also adjust menstruation, rosy cheeks, and keep youth forever.</p>
<h3 id="e91">The Relationship between Spermatorrhea and Brain Weakness and Insomnia <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>Excessive spermatorrhea can lead to brain weakness and insomnia, which young people with a little common sense should know! At the same time, if a young person suffers from insomnia due to excessive use of the brain, or due to hot weather, unrequited love, sadness, etc., they are also most likely to suffer from spermatorrhea. Accordingly, in this hot and humid season, sweating is endless, the air is humid, and the air pressure is quite low, so there is often a phenomenon of nocturnal emission. If those who have always had spermatorrhea do not pay attention to prevention and treatment, then the symptoms will inevitably worsen. Therefore, there are those who are led to spermatorrhea, sperm leakage, and brain, spinal cord, and sexual triple nerve weakness caused by spermatorrhea. As a result, various symptoms such as headache, amnesia, insomnia, sadness, backache, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, and dissipation of energy will follow. Such young people will not only be depressed and afraid of cold and heat, but will also see their lives in distress and achieve nothing! At the same time, due to the pain of love, even if they get married through matchmakers and parents' orders, they will not be happy in their marital life, be hated by their wives, or even have no children, leaving lifelong regrets! Therefore, young people should not take spermatorrhea lightly. In this yellow plum season, they should pay special attention to prevention. According to the world's famous doctors and my experience, the effective treatment for spermatorrhea is to take "Hemetos' Spermatin Tablets" to strengthen the spermatic gate, calm the nerves, and make you sleep peacefully at night and reduce dreams, so that spermatorrhea can be stopped that night. If the above symptoms have already occurred due to spermatorrhea, you must also take the reproductive gland element preparation "Reproductin" to cultivate the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. If you can continue to take it, you will definitely be able to cure the above symptoms in a short period of time and can also guarantee a cure.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Editor's Remarks <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Although foreign exchange has plummeted and prices have soared in recent days, customers sincerely want old brands and things that are believed by tens of thousands of people, and they are never willing to take advantage of opportunities. For example, the giants in the domestic cigarette industry—Huacheng and Nanyang—the cigarettes they produce, first, will not easily increase prices unless it is absolutely necessary, so as not to burden old customers; second, they will not give away gifts as a cover for cutting corners, so they can enjoy a long-standing reputation and remain prosperous. This is a good example. It is heard that the various famous medicines such as "Reproductin" and "Hemetos' Spermatin Tablets" managed by Anliss Pharmaceutical in this city, because they were purchased very early, so they also stick to these two New Year's resolutions. Moderate and not rising prices, not giving away gifts, because fairness lies in the hearts of the people, and you can see the difference after taking them, so they do not make false propaganda.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Do Not Use Patients as Sacrificial Items to Treat Gonorrhea! <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Among venereal diseases, none is more contagious than gonorrhea. At the same time, in terms of treatment, none is more difficult to treat than gonorrhea. However, the world knows that it is so, but does not know why. Since gonorrhea is a difficult disease to treat, its treatment should be treated with utmost caution. Unfortunately, patients often privately take over-the-counter drugs that are rampant on the market, or blindly believe in a rigid surgical operation with local medical instruments. Gonorrhea is not limited to the local area, and the symptoms are not fixed, so how can one adhere to a single over-the-counter drug, which is no different from carving a boat to seek a sword, because there is only one kind of medicine and the disease is ever-changing. As for local surgical instrument therapy, at best, it only acts on the local area. In fact, wanting to squeeze out gonococci by washing with medical instruments is like a fool's dream, and only fools believe it. Because after gonorrhea invades the posterior urethra, its physiological structure is very complex, and gonococci can survive everywhere. It is impossible to completely drive out the gonococci with simple medical instruments.</p>
<p>With my experience of more than ten years, I treat gonorrhea without sticking to set methods. I use needles, medicines, electrotherapy, news ions, massage, etc. I first rely on scientific diagnostic methods to understand the condition, and then treat the symptoms. The treatments I use are the most advanced, such as the German Lulin Pingliu electric method in electrotherapy, the German Xishi serum in blood serum, and the latest chemical therapy for internal medicine. The responsibility of us doctors is to seek a quick cure, neither sticking to set methods nor competing for novelty, and not using patients as sacrificial items.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Middle School Students Without Original School Certificates Can Still Graduate If Several Subjects Are Passed; Those Who Pass All Subjects After Borrowing May Have Previous Subjects Considered as Passing <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>(Fangyan Correspondence) The Zhejiang Education Department previously stated that since the War of Resistance Against Japan, there have been many students in the province whose student status could not be determined because the original schools were in the war zone and could not obtain certificates. Regarding the graduation of these students, the department previously instructed the schools that transferred or borrowing students who had reached graduation, if their graduation exam scores were passing, and because the situation of the original school was unknown, and they could not submit the transcript of the previous semesters, the middle school would first issue a graduation certificate. Now, in order to conclude the graduation problem of these students and make a unified decision, it will be handled in accordance with the method of the Guangdong Provincial Education Department's Order No. 944 of the Ministry of Education in 1938. For middle school students who borrow or transfer, if the grades of each subject in the previous semesters cannot be submitted at the time of graduation, and the scores after borrowing are passing, the grades of each subject in the previous years can be regarded as passing. The schools that have issued graduation certificates to the previous graduates can prepare graduation certificates, together with a list of graduates' scores, and send them to the department for review and re-issuance. The province's public and private middle schools have been informed accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e95">A Summary of Chinese Broadcasting Education in the Last Three Years (3): Dispatching Personnel for Inspection and Evaluation of Results; Allocating Funds Starting from the Fifth Year <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Evaluation of Results</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education successively promulgated various measures for implementing broadcasting education in provinces and cities, as well as guidelines for secondary schools and public education centers using broadcasting education. It also issued key points for provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus to pay attention to regarding electro-visual education administration, and key points for implementing electro-visual education in provinces and cities in the 26th year. These documents contained detailed regulations on the tasks and performance evaluation of personnel at all levels. The Ministry of Education and provincial and municipal inspectors and supervisors, when inspecting schools and centers equipped with radios, also included the radio reception performance as an important evaluation item for these schools and centers.</p>
<p>Allocation of Funds</p>
<p>When the Ministry of Education initiated and managed broadcasting education in the 24th year, there were no dedicated funds. Expenses were only paid by economizing on the ministry's operating expenses. Starting from the 25th year, after the central government determined the funds for public construction, 300,000 yuan was allocated specifically for broadcasting education. In the 26th year, 135,000 yuan was allocated, including subsidies to provinces and cities for radios and dry batteries, accounting for 125,000 yuan. From July to December of the 27th year, 40,000 yuan was allocated, including subsidies to provinces and cities for radios and dry batteries, accounting for 35,000 yuan, and broadcasting education administration accounting for 5,000 yuan. Provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus also allocated special funds for broadcasting education according to the Ministry of Education's orders. Radio receiving agencies were also required to allocate funds for broadcasting education within their respective operating expenses. However, due to the difficulty of raising funds in various provinces, cities, and counties, the required amount of funds for the operation has not yet been achieved.</p>
<p>Remedying Difficulties</p>
<p>(1) There are too few domestic manufacturers of radios and dry batteries. The output is insufficient to meet the demand, and the production sites are mostly concentrated in Shanghai, making procurement and transportation difficult. Remote provinces often suffer from damage to components and battery failure after long periods of transportation. The Ministry of Education has requested the Resources Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Central Radio Manufacturing Plant, to increase the production of radios, and to add dry battery manufacturing plants in Sichuan, Yunnan, Shaanxi, and Gansu to facilitate procurement in the northwest and southwest border provinces. (2) The Ministry of Education has trained few electro-visual education personnel in the past, and they cannot be widely dispatched to serve in various counties. In addition, the procurement of parts and components is inconvenient in various provinces, cities, and counties, resulting in frequent radio damage and inability to repair. Starting from the 27th year, the Ministry of Education and provincial education departments have added technical personnel to provide radio technology guidance to various provinces and cities. (3) There is no dedicated educational broadcasting station, so the educational programs that are set up are affected by other programs, and the programs cannot be expanded as much as possible. The Ministry of Education originally had a plan to set up its own shortwave broadcasting station, but it was unsuccessful due to the war. It is reported that the ministry will continue to plan and set it up after the situation is calm, for the purpose of broadcasting educational programs exclusively. (4) The Ministry of Education, in view of the uneconomical and inconvenient purchase and distribution of radios in the past, ordered the Broadcasting Education Committee to set up a small factory to manufacture radios. Unfortunately, it was affected by the war shortly after its establishment and stopped. Now, the ministry has cooperated with the Electrical Engineering Factory of Jinda College of Science to assemble radios, which can temporarily remedy the situation. It is reported that after the situation is stable, it can be restored to work and manufacture its own factories. (5) Regarding the examination of radio reception results, although the Ministry of Education has formulated rules and instructed supervisors and inspectors to inspect them at any time, most of these inspection personnel are just taking a cursory look. It is still questionable whether all radio receiving agencies can listen to educational broadcasts on time. It is reported that the Ministry of Education plans to increase the number of broadcasting tests once a month, that is, to compile a simple test based on the broadcasting materials of this month, and broadcast the test questions. Those who participate will be given small prizes to encourage them. The implementation of this method also increases the interest of radio reception personnel. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e96">How to Guide Children's Holiday Life <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Guanliu</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Learn until you are old, and you will never learn enough." It can be seen that our pursuit of knowledge is not limited to a specific place, nor is it limited to a specific time. We cannot say that schools are places for acquiring knowledge, while homes and society are not. We cannot say that term time is a time for learning, while rest days and holidays are not. Therefore, we must guide children to learn new things and acquire new knowledge anytime and anywhere. However, based on this principle, we can know that even if it is summer vacation, it does not mean that it is a time for children to purely rest and not acquire knowledge. It only means that due to the weather conditions, the methods of acquiring knowledge and the activities of children need to be changed to another method.</p>
<p>How exactly do children's methods of acquiring knowledge and activities change during the holidays? It can be divided into three aspects: First, in terms of knowledge activities, this means changing the form of class and adopting self-study methods. Assign self-study holiday assignments to children to do, so that children can gain new knowledge from reviewing their homework. Second, in terms of civic activities, this means changing children's narrow school life into a broad social life. Within the scope of children's abilities, take advantage of the spare time during the holidays to participate in appropriate social work. Third, in terms of health activities, this means reducing the burden of children's homework during the holidays, paying attention to physical exercise, paying attention to hygiene, reducing the intrusion of diseases, paying attention to sports, and increasing the health of the body.</p>
<p>Ordinary schools think that when the holidays arrive, they only need to assign some holiday assignments to children to do, and they think that they have done their best. In fact, this is still not enough, because children's lifestyles are different from usual during the summer vacation. Teachers must guide them on how to spend this long holiday life. Moreover, since the summer vacation is not a time for studying with peace of mind, they leave the school and return to their families, with more opportunities to contact society. Therefore, they should be guided to do some social activities to enable children to understand and learn about society from this work. Secondly, in terms of health, the summer is originally the most unhygienic time, because the hot weather and the breeding of mosquitoes and flies often make it easy for people to get sick. Therefore, the more it is in summer, the more attention should be paid to hygiene, so as to maintain health. Therefore, during the summer vacation, health activities and social activities are more valuable, more meaningful, and more worthy of our advocacy and guidance than knowledge activities.</p>
<p>Regarding social activities, there are several tasks that can be guided to do:</p>
<p>(1) Organize reading clubs, contact nearby classmates, discuss with each other, and seek progress together.</p>
<p>(2) Promote "little teachers" and do some popular education work, teaching illiterate people in their own families or relatives and neighbors.</p>
<p>(3) Discuss current affairs issues and use collective methods to systematically and plan to study current affairs knowledge.</p>
<p>(4) Publish neighborhood wall newspapers or do live radio broadcasts to increase the knowledge of the general public and arouse the research of the general public.</p>
<p>(5) Implement mosquito and fly eradication work, pay attention to nearby public health, and do some epidemic prevention work.</p>
<p>(6) Promote frugality and disaster relief to awaken the general public's understanding of frugality. Actively implement frugality work.</p>
<p>Regarding health activities, there are also several tasks that can be guided to children to do:</p>
<p>(1) Do morning exercises for ten minutes every morning, (2) Play a few games every week, (3) Take a walk outside a few times every week, (4) Take a bath every day, (5) Underwear work, (6) Have a fixed amount of food every day, (7) Have a fixed time to sleep every day.</p>
<p>If the above tasks can be guided to children to do, then children's holiday life can have satisfactory results.</p>

<p>(London, 26th, Havas) The Heberden Tennis Championships began today. Queen Mary also attended the match. In the men's singles, German tennis star Krahmer and Australian star Brownvich did not participate. In addition, Chinese tennis player Xu Chengji, although he had participated, temporarily announced his withdrawal. All of this has reduced the interest in the competition.</p>
<p>(Heberden, 26th, Reuters) Chinese tennis star Xu Chengji has withdrawn from the Heberden Men's Singles Championship. Xu told Reuters that his back muscles had not healed since winning the Birmingham Championship. It has not yet been decided whether to participate in doubles. Xu's withdrawal allowed the British Twenties to enter the second week without a fight. (Note: Xu's hopes this year were better than in the past. Although he was listed as a seed player in the previous tournament, he was not selected this year, but it is not extravagant to expect to reach at least the quarter-final week. Xu's failure to be selected as a seed player this year may be due to his unexpected defeat to France in the Taiwan tournament. His disadvantage lies in his lack of physical strength, his inability to fight five sets, which led to the defeat of the British star Bowness, and his success in other European competitions has made tennis experts deeply believe that he will have an amazing masterpiece in this year's Heberden tournament.)</p>
<p>He Renxuan</p>
<p>Another Chinese player, He Renxuan, was defeated by Czech Trona on the opening day today, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4. Xu Chengji was a guest of honor. Trona, who shoots with his left hand, hit straight into the corner of the net with his quick shots, making He Renxuan helpless. He's first ball was unreliable. His heyday was in the third set, where he fought to a 4-4 tie.</p>
<p>Cai Huiquan</p>
<p>Chinese Davis Cup player Cai Huiquan defeated Irish player Egan in five sets, 5-7, 1-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-3. Cai's performance was completely lackluster. Initially, his hits were chaotic. In the third set, he only managed to win with a powerful stroke. Egan won two sets in a row, but finally collapsed. The two fought fiercely for two hours.</p>

<p>The weather was fine today, but then the clouds gathered.

<p>Science and Life</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Recognition of the Whole <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Qian</p>
<p>There are many reasons why science has not been fully developed in our country. However, one of the biggest reasons is that our people do not have a clear understanding of science itself. Whenever we do something, we always think of finding a shortcut, looking for a secret, thinking that we can reap success and achieve a lifetime of peace. The same psychology is also inevitable in our study of academics. Seventy or eighty years ago, our people already knew the importance of science, and the government was quite keen to promote it. At that time, there was no shortage of people in the country who were determined to research science. However, what they recognized for this kind of work was only one end of science, not the whole. For example, mathematics is a broad and profound academic field, and its importance in the position of science, and the need to pay attention to promotion in the country, is undoubtedly. However, only knowing to focus on this subject and neglecting various sciences, thinking that this subject is the mother of all sciences, and that if we can deeply understand mathematics, then all scientific problems can be solved easily, is also inevitable to have an excessive bias. In the past, the Shanghai Gezhi College originally aimed at cultivating scientific talents, and most of those who studied there were also talented people of the time, and they all tended to one way of mathematics. They did not have time to attack physics, chemistry, and other fields, and they regarded biology and geology as trivial matters. It is heard that the instruments purchased by the college for the study of physics, chemistry, and other subjects were as numerous as the eaves, but they were not used and were left to rot. The students focused on mathematics, thinking that once they had a deep understanding of this subject, all instruments could be used as tools to solve all scientific problems. In the end, only one or two of them seemed to have made some achievements in mathematics, while they were still completely unaware of the other scientific fields. Sciences other than mathematics were not noticed and had no hope of budding and growing. What is said above is just one example. In the past few decades, there have been countless such errors in our country's promotion of science and research of science. Science itself is a healthy organic matter, in which each field is indispensable, so that it can receive the effect of helping each other. All fields of science must be equally valued. With the overall development of science, agitation and tempering, assistance and observation, practical science will continue to progress, benefiting people's livelihoods, and solving countless difficulties for the country and society. I hope that those who promote science education in the country will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Food and Nutrition <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>Ancient philosophers have considered the need for food and nutrition. However, the progress of nutritional knowledge, like other sciences, started with experiments, gaining an inch at a time, a foot at a time, and gradually expanding until the threads could be straightened out. In fact, the era of experiments began a hundred years ago. In this short period of a hundred years, it is a great achievement in science to be able to go from complete darkness to gradually seeing the light.</p>
<p>More than 2,300 years ago, the Greek Hippocrates, the ancestor of Western medicine, believed that all foods contain a universal nourishing substance. That is to say, although there are ten thousand kinds of food, there is only one kind of nourishing substance. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Martin began to feed various foods to animals for experiments. However, it was limited to non-nitrogenous foods such as sugar gum. The precision of its experimental methods is quite strict for later generations. Its ability to distinguish the effects of nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous foods has laid the foundation for modern physiology and biochemistry. Years later, Mulbaomin distinguished the similarities of various protein substances in the body of animals and plants, and named them "proloti", which is still considered to be the main organic substance in the body. Combined with Li Biexu's achievements, the knowledge of food chemistry has been increased a lot. Lai Fuxie and Vander's research on the energy required by the human body are also worthy of record. At the end of the nineteenth century, the US Department of Agriculture's announcement contained nutritional value conditions: listing the chemical composition of food, the proportion of nutritional components, the ease of digestion, the comparison of fuel values, the relationship between nutrition and price, the most suitable food and nutritional value ratio required by endurance in various industries, and so on.</p>
<p>Experts studying nutritional issues have devoted themselves to explaining the experience of humans with various foods for many years. However, society still despises the nutritional theory created by scientists, mostly because everyone has their own experience of food. Most people think that the method of choosing suitable food is purely based on appetite and economic ability as the criteria, which is enough to deal with it. However, after animal feeding experiments, it is certain that there are several diseases of nutritional imbalance that can be obtained from food experiments. This kind of imbalance is no different from ordinary diseases, so it is not easy to understand the main cause. Since the application of the knowledge of food properties to the research of diseases, it is known that wrong food is the root cause of physical weakness and early death. Paying attention to the conditioning of food can make the sick healthy and the healthy long-lived. This is true.</p>
<p>The history of the progress of nutrition research is the result of decades or hundreds of people's deep thinking and detailed verification over the past hundred years. The purpose is nothing more than to seek knowledge of the necessity of human nutrition and the nature of food. One of the most important sections is the invention of trace vitamins. Trace vitamins are sometimes transliterated as vitamins, sometimes transliterated as vitamins or vital factors. The revised translation is trace vitamins, although it is a transliteration, it also shows that the amount in food is very small, but the use is very effective. If it is adjusted to be the safety factor for maintaining life, then it is not worth this type of substance, and all foods are essential elements for maintaining life. Moreover, strictly speaking, trace vitamins are not chemically of the same type of substance. At first, knowledge was naive and their properties were not understood, so they were collectively called trace vitamins, just like XY in algebra as the representative of unknown numbers and A and B in novels represent unnamed people.</p>
<h3 id="e110">How Drinking Harms Health <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Yi</p>
<p>Alcohol poisoning can be divided into two types: acute and chronic. So-called drunkenness is acute poisoning. It is said to be due to the stimulating nature of alcohol, but in reality, alcohol is not a stimulant. It inhibits the part of the brain that normally restricts personal behavior, leading to a loss of self-control.</p>
<p>Once the brain loses its self-control, thoughts are freed from their usual rationality and caution, allowing them to roam freely. Therefore, a drunkard often becomes rude, talkative, loudly and strangely laughing, and exhibits various abnormal behaviors. A heavily intoxicated person may even become dazed or even fall into a coma. In this state of overindulgence, one staggers while walking, speaks incoherently, the face flushes, the pulse quickens, the eyes become bloodshot, and increased blood flow to the brain causes dizziness. Vomiting is also a common symptom.</p>
<p>Alcohol has a local irritant effect, especially on the stomach. It can cause redness and swelling of the stomach lining, forming minor ulcers. People who drink alcohol for a long time will inevitably develop serious pathological changes in their stomachs. Swallowing liquors with extremely high alcohol content, such as Gaoliang spirit, will inevitably cause a burning sensation in the abdomen, indicating the local effect of alcohol in the stomach.</p>
<p>The stomach does not usually absorb food, but alcohol is an exception, being absorbed very easily, so poisoning occurs rapidly. Those who wish to avoid intoxication for a long time should never drink on an empty stomach, as alcohol is absorbed faster on an empty stomach than when full.</p>
<p>The best food to eat while drinking or beforehand is fatty food. Alcohol is an excellent solvent for fat, so the two have a special affinity. Carbohydrates (sugar, candied fruit, sweets) are the worst foods to accompany alcohol. Chemically speaking, carbohydrates are a disguised form of alcohol. Therefore, all sweet wines should be avoided.</p>
<p>Because drunkenness is a very common occurrence, people rarely think about the more serious condition of chronic alcohol poisoning. If alcohol is consumed continuously, leading to long-term alcohol poisoning, significant changes occur in the body. Some are so severe that they disrupt normal physiological functions and lead to death. The first inevitable change occurs in the digestive tract. Alcohol acts as a local irritant, causing indigestion, loss of appetite, and chronic catarrhal cough, known as "alcoholic cough."</p>
<p>A red nose is a marker of chronic alcohol poisoning, indicating the impairment of blood vessels. Alcohol acts on the walls of blood vessels, causing them to degenerate. As the walls weaken, the blood vessels dilate; the small blood vessels on the nose and cheeks allow more blood to enter, thus causing these areas to turn red. Any poisoning of the viscera and blood vessels must cause corresponding damage to the internal organs connected to the portal system.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who suffer from long-term chronic alcohol poisoning will inevitably have all their important organs affected, with the kidneys being the first to be harmed.</p>
<p>With changes in blood supply, alcohol exerts its latent harmful effects on the muscles. The voluntary muscles (muscles we can control) of the affected person are partially damaged by fatty degeneration, thus certain muscle groups show signs of paralysis, and the entire musculature displays inconsistent and miserable signs.</p>
<p>If the amount consumed is very small and can be completely oxidized by the body, alcohol is very much like a food. Because it can generate energy, some even mistakenly call it food. But when consumed in excess, alcohol is absolutely toxic. Therefore, if civilized people must indulge in drinking for pleasure, the only way is to use the power of education to guide them to drink in moderation. The saying, "Do not drink excessively, lest you become disorderly," is our ancient teaching.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Great Revolutions of the Earth <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>The phenomenon of revolution (Revolution) is seen in many human affairs, such as political revolution, social revolution, economic revolution, and even family revolution, psychological revolution, etc. Any major reform in human society can be called a revolution. However, these are all small-scale revolutions, not to be compared with the great revolution. The so-called greatest revolution can only be applied to the Earth. The Earth has undergone about four periods of dramatic changes, which are called the Four Great Revolutions. The other changes it has experienced are not comparable to these. These four great revolutions were all caused by the expansion or contraction of the Earth's internal magma, which inevitably caused the Earth's crust to bulge or sink. These drastic changes caused mountains to rise suddenly, deep ravines to sink, glaciers to flow horizontally, and the climate to change abruptly. All mountain ranges, rivers, and all living organisms on the Earth's surface were greatly affected. For example, trilobites, ancient insects, ancient members, turtles, ancient amphibians, and giant reptiles (such as various dinosaurs, dragons, ichthyosaurs, etc.), primitive birds, and giant mammals in fossils mostly lost their lives and became extinct during a great revolutionary period. All living organisms in the world today are fortunate to have escaped extinction, or have evolved as a result of the threat of great revolutions, to the degree they are today. The first of these four great revolutions was discovered in the early Cambrian period of the Paleozoic Era, about 100 million years ago. The third occurred at the junction of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras, this change being slightly less than the first two, about 60 million years ago. The fourth occurred in the later period of the Cenozoic Era (Pleistocene), about one million years ago, far less than these four, so it cannot be called a revolution. But the future is long. Will there be another great revolution in the future? Will a large part of all living organisms in the world (including humans) be imprisoned and become extinct, and will new ones emerge to replace them? This is also unknowable. Or perhaps, with the increasing development of science, humans will be able to use it to avoid the disaster of extinction.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Peach Blossom Musings <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Qiaoxia Ke</p>
<p>"In the third month of late spring, the grasses of Jiangnan grow tall, miscellaneous flowers bloom on the trees, and warblers fly in a chaotic manner. Seeing the flags and drums of the old country, I feel the past in my heart," these few sentences, for some reason, now cause some people to feel deeply moved. Thus, peach blossom musings are evoked.</p>
<p>Some Western scholars have reduced all of life's phenomena to the relationship between the sexes; this may be a bit of an oversimplification. Of course, we cannot deny that sexual activity—reproduction—in the biological world is the most important part of life, and we humans are no exception. However, where there is writing, a word "love" is created out of nowhere, and sometimes this ordinary word is clothed in a mysterious cloak. What is going on? If we say that patriotism and love of one's hometown express a need for a suitable environment; love of calligraphy and painting, and love of antiques express a need for an object of study; love of relatives, acquaintances, and friends expresses a kind of sympathy, then we can say that love is need. Or, if someone needs love, how should this be explained? What's so difficult about that? He just needs a need; a person with no needs is inconceivable. Or, people all need to eat, but people don't seem to love rice, wouldn't that be inconsistent? Oh, how is that relevant? If you haven't eaten for three days, I think you can't help but squeeze your stomach and shout, "Rice, I am willing to sacrifice everything for you." Therefore, "a short pass at the Three Gorges at dusk, only seeing your affection later," is moved only after a close friend dies, and "customs across the world are mutually loving" is appreciated only after leaving one's hometown; all are the same. These examples of love are not mysterious. Now comes the love between men and women, we can say that it is a need between men and women, but it must be divided into two kinds: one is organizational on a social level, such as managing household affairs, division of labor between inside and outside, and the other is based on the common rules of biology, which is to complete sexual intercourse. The first kind of need is no different in principle from loving relatives, acquaintances, and friends; the second kind of need is unique to men and women, so the problem arises here. Sexual desire is best exemplified by appetite; when hungry, one must eat, and one does not refuse to achieve it by any means. When full, the matter is finished. Who would still hold a bowl of rice and admire it after being full? That is the world's greatest lover. Of course, the length of time the whole process takes is different. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e114">Finance: Gold Bar Collateral Loans Vanish; Spot Feels Oversupplied; Continues to Fall for Five Days: Mostly Small Transactions, Few Bulk Deals: Approximately 600 Taels <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot market for cash gold continued to trend downward, having fallen for five consecutive days. This phenomenon is actually due to the virtual disappearance of gold bar collateral loans after the Ministry of Finance restricted the withdrawal of legal tender, resulting in the lack of strong buyers who are unable to operate easily. Furthermore, the exchange rate has also been easing for days, and people's sentiment is ultimately weary and unable to rally. Today's market was further triggered by the easing exchange rate, causing securities firms to repeatedly sell relentlessly. In addition, a certain bank also saw more outflows than inflows. Although Hong Kong buyers had some appetite, the head position still felt oversupplied. The market trend remained weak, once retreating to a low of 2,495 yuan. Subsequently, gold shops and retail investors took advantage of the low prices to absorb, and the underlying trend stabilized, hovering around 2,500 yuan. As a result, the closing price was 2,500 yuan, continuing to fall by 30 yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions were mostly small, with few bulk deals, totaling approximately 600 taels. Gold jewelry also fell slightly by four yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Cash Trade at 2,500 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial opening price per tael (ten taels) fell slightly by ten yuan because it was heard that the exchange rate was hardening again, making people more tired. The market opened at 9:40 AM, with cash houses selling two taels to money changers at a price of 2,510 yuan. Subsequently, cash houses sold another ten taels to gold shops at the same price. At that time, securities firms suddenly started selling, and the market trend became even weaker, falling seven yuan in an instant. Securities firms sold 50 taels to a certain gold shop at 13 yuan. Soon after, securities firms sold another 50 taels to a certain gold shop at 10 yuan (rumored to be on behalf of Hong Kong buyers). Later, securities firms sold another 30 taels to gold houses at 12 yuan. After that, the exchange rate continued to harden, and buyers were scarce, so the price plummeted another ten yuan. Money changers sold two taels to a certain bank at a price of two yuan. At that time, securities firms continued to sell aggressively, and buyers were watching from the sidelines, so the price became even more unsustainable, breaking through the 2,500 yuan mark. Securities firms sold ten taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 495 yuan. Then, a group of retail investors suddenly took advantage of the low prices to absorb, and the selling momentum of securities firms slowed down slightly, immediately showing a rebound. Money changers sold two taels to gold shops at a price of 500 yuan. Immediately, money changers sold another ten taels to a certain bank at a price of four yuan, and two taels to colleagues at a price of three yuan. At that time, gold shops were more eager to buy, and the trend continued to rise gradually. A certain gold shop bought 30 taels from a certain bank at a price of six yuan. Gold houses bought two taels from cash houses at a price of seven yuan. Gold shops bought ten taels from securities firms and 50 taels from a certain bank, both at a price of eight yuan. As noon approached, the market trend weakened again. Cash houses sold 50 taels to gold houses, pressing the price down to 500 yuan as the closing price for the morning. The afternoon trend was flat and tired. At about 2:00 PM, money changers traded ten taels with each other at a price of two yuan. Then, money changers sold 50 taels to Yuhao at a price of 500 yuan. At that time, securities firms slightly increased their supply, selling 50 taels to money changers at a price of 498 yuan. Soon after, money changers traded ten taels with each other at a price of 497 yuan. Afterwards, sellers' willingness to supply weakened, and the price immediately rebounded. At 2:45 PM, gold houses bought 50 taels from money changers, with 2,500 yuan as the closing price for the evening. As a result, it continued to fall by 30 yuan compared to yesterday, and it has fallen for five consecutive days, totaling 200 yuan. The fluctuations throughout the day were 25 yuan. The wooden sign gold price of cash houses was ten yuan higher, and the current market price was 50 yuan lower. According to inquiries, there were very few trades.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Price Lowered Twice by Four Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael remained unchanged at first, but by 9:55 AM, it was lowered by two yuan, and then lowered by another two yuan at about 10:00 AM, due to the weakness of spot gold. After that, the spot gold situation stabilized, so there were no more changes. The Big Guild posted 250 yuan, the New Guild posted 251 yuan, and Mumu posted 245 yuan.</p>
<p>Sino-British Pure Gold Remained Unchanged</p>
<p>According to a London dispatch on the 26th, the price of British pure gold remained unchanged at seven pounds, eight shillings, and sixpence per ounce. Therefore, the market prices of various central banks also remained unchanged. The cash buying price in China was 1,212.3 yuan, the listed customs gold price was 2.396 yuan, and the Shanghai standard gold price was also 1,207.6 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation saw no changes in the HSBC listing price. The sentiment in the unofficial market was that Japanese banks' willingness to sell was increasing day by day (one theory is that the forward trading is arbitrage), and foreign dispatches from Indian silver companies were also selling. Chinese banks and foreign banks occasionally followed suit due to the need for legal tender at the end of the month. In addition, foreign banks' appetite for buying was not strong, so the situation was quite easy and hard to bear. Although foreign firms made some settlements in the middle, the overall position was still oversupplied, resulting in a sharp easing at one point. The British exchange rate of 6 pence 875 and the US exchange rate of 13.4375 yuan could both be settled. Later, Sassoon bought a large amount, and the price softened slightly, but still lengthened. Trading throughout the day was still strong. The Hong Kong exchange rate initially eased along with the British and American exchange rates to 46.25 yuan, but it tightened slightly after foreign firms bought. As a result, it still lengthened by 75.</p>
<p>Head Position Still Oversupplied</p>
<p>In the morning, the initial situation was that the London big bars were flat in the near and far term, the New York silver price remained unchanged, and the London raw gold also lacked changes. Exchange rates were flat between British and American, between Liu and Shanghai, and between them and France. The US exchange rate was 0.0625 higher against British, 0.05 lower against Shanghai, and flat against France. The central listing prices of various exchange rates remained the same. The banks' morning opening spot selling prices were British gold 6 pence 78125 and US exchange rate 13.25 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the British and American exchange rates showed no changes. After the opening, foreign firms came to buy, but Japanese banks and foreign dispatches were eager to sell, causing the market to harden. Japanese banks sold spot British gold to Youli for 6 pence 8125, and then Japanese banks and Indian silver companies competed to sell spot US exchange to foreign banks for 13.3125 yuan and 375. Later, foreign firms settled spot British gold with HSBC. The British gold price was 6 pence 78125, and also purchased and settled spot US exchange from a certain bank for 13.3125 yuan. HSBC's listing price was announced as unchanged, and the silver balance tax was also announced without rising or falling, still collecting 2.75%. After that, Western merchants Sassoon tried to force a purchase, but Chinese banks and foreign Dutch banks sold very actively, and Japanese banks repeatedly sold aggressively. In addition, foreign merchants' banks' appetite for buying was very weak, so the position was several times oversupplied for a while. Therefore, the situation became more and more hardened. Japanese banks and Chinese banks successively sold spot British gold to Sassoon for 6 pence 84375. Then, Japanese banks and Chinese banks competed with foreign Dutch banks to sell spot US exchange to Sassoon, easing from 13.40625 yuan to 4375. Later, Japanese banks sold spot British gold to HSBC, hardening to 6 pence 875. As noon approached, foreign firms also hardened the spot Hong Kong exchange rate to 46.125 yuan. Extended to the noon close, the banks' spot selling prices were British gold 6 pence 84375, US exchange rate 13.375 yuan, and Hong Kong exchange rate 46.25 yuan.</p>
<p>Sassoon's Settlement Quantity Not Weak</p>
<p>In the afternoon, foreign firms continued to buy spot US exchange from foreign banks for 13.375 yuan. Then, Japanese banks started selling again, selling spot British gold to Western merchants Sassoon and foreign HSBC for 6 pence 875. The market situation remained hard. Afterwards, foreign banks were very willing to sell British and American exchange rates, resulting in an increasingly easy situation. At that time, foreign firms also bought spot Hong Kong exchange rate from Anta Holland for 46.125 yuan, and the situation softened slightly. Extended to the evening close, the banks' spot selling prices were British gold 6 pence 875, US exchange rate 13.40625 yuan. As a result, it lengthened by 0.09375 compared to the British exchange rate of the previous day, and the American exchange rate hardened by 1.5625. The Hong Kong exchange rate was valued at the transaction price and was also cheaper by 0.75. The following is a record of the trades opened throughout the day:</p>
<h3 id="e116">Demand for Cash Very Strong, Foreign Currencies Fall One After Another <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British pure gold was moving slightly, and the British-American exchange rate rose by 0.0625. Foreign exchange firms in this port settled a lot, the supply from foreign banks was smooth, Japanese banks were eager to sell, and the market situation was easy. The evening close for British exchange rate was 6 pence 875, easing 0.09375 compared to the previous day, and the US exchange rate was 13.40625 yuan, also easing 1.5625. The gold market opened with the tired momentum of the previous day, trading ten yuan lower. After the opening, exchange tickets eased, gold house customers sold a lot, and buyers' appetite was dull, the falling trend was quite dramatic, once falling to 2,495 yuan. Money changers took the opportunity to absorb slightly, and the market situation stabilized, with the noon close at 2,500 yuan. In the afternoon, the volume of transactions gradually decreased, and the market situation hovered. The evening close did not change. As a result, it fell by 30 yuan compared to the previous day. The supply of British and American gold pounds was relatively smooth, and market prices fell. British and American gold tickets were weak due to the easing of exchange tickets, and customer demand was sluggish, and market prices fell quite sharply. The demand for Hong Kong tickets, French tickets, Singapore tickets, etc., was rare, and all followed the decline. Only Italian tickets had demand and saw a unique increase. Japanese gold tickets were sold, and the market situation has eased, with the evening market at 9 jiao 9 fen 2 li. The demand for Korean tickets was also rare, with the evening market at 9 jiao. In public association trading, only Xiang Kang sold and Xiang Tai bought 100 yuan of American gold tickets. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds fell 5 jiao, British gold tickets fell 5 jiao, American gold pounds fell 7 jiao, American gold tickets fell 1 jiao 5 fen, Hong Kong tickets fell 1 fen, French tickets fell 3 li, Singapore tickets fell 6 fen, Dutch tickets fell 3 fen, Robbie tickets fell 5 fen, Canadian tickets fell 7 fen, Italian tickets rose 3 fen, Australian gold tickets fell 1 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Discount Rate Still Outside the 100 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts and bills of exchange was seen to fall back. In the morning, it was around 110 yuan per thousand yuan, and it was not supported until the afternoon, and finally stepped down, retreating to 102.5 yuan, a decrease of 7.5 yuan compared to the previous day's price. The borrowing rate of the Money Industry Association remained unchanged, with both morning and afternoon markets suspended at 2 jiao 5 fen.</p>

<p>The listed prices of London Chinese foreign debts on the 26th of this month (week) have continued to decline. Among the upper-tier debts, the French-American gold (with seal) and the British-French issuance of rehabilitation debts each fell by 3 pounds, the former Zhejiang was 46 pounds, and the latter was 31 pounds. The British-German continued British issuance fell by 2 pounds, the price was 48 pounds, and Crispe fell by 1 pound, the price was 22.5 pounds.

It was also heard that there were also transactions of Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bonds, with a transaction price of 18 pounds.</p>
<p>The stock market of the Public Industry Association continued to be calm, with few transactions. People's sentiment was waiting and watching, the situation was uncertain, and credit was extremely tight, so that the market could not improve for a while. Only Jardine Matheson shares were still actively traded. The opening price was 18.6 yuan, and the closing price was 18.3 yuan, with a total of 11,000 shares traded. The rubber stock market remained stable, but there were few buyers at present.

<h3 id="e118">Industrial and Commercial Discussions on Assistance: Those Hedging Foreign Exchange Should Be Aware <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Ben</p>
<p>Foreign merchant factories and firms import a batch of raw materials, and must settle the payment for the goods by buying foreign exchange. However, the raw materials cannot be exchanged for money immediately, and there is a shortage of cash positions. They have to entrust domestic banks to come forward, collect credit deposits, sell at low prices in the near term, and buy at high prices in the long term. The interest rate is 2-3%, and the term is limited to one month. This is because they are forced to quench their thirst with poison due to the shortage of funds. General wealthy merchants and financiers are greedy for petty profits and do not hesitate to act as accomplices for tigers, making wedding clothes for others. As the saying goes, "Where there is profit, people flock to it."</p>
<p>Ten days ago: the exchange market changed drastically, and the shilling suddenly shrank, from a listed price of 8 pence 25 softening to 6 pence and a half. The cost increased by 20%, people panicked, and foreign firms aggressively absorbed. In addition, the end of the month was approaching, and the need for funds was urgent. The interest rate reached 5.5%. Sure enough, "under a heavy reward, there must be brave men." Within two or three days, foreign merchants' banks collected this deposit; reaching 8-9 million yuan, both parties established the contract on the same day, and the settlement was at the end of the month (payment). The US dollar was at least 5,000 yuan (equivalent to more than 40,000 legal currency), and as much as 25,000 yuan, or even 50,000 yuan. However, wealthy households from all over the place concentrated on the isolated island, and were confused and did not know where to invest. Now that they heard this news, they all rushed to donate enthusiastically. Therefore, within two or three days, this huge figure was filled. Capitalists only know "profit for themselves," and do not know about national economy and people's livelihood, disrupting the financial system. Unexpectedly, the Ministry of Finance's electric message on the 21st instructed to restrict the withdrawal of deposits, which was like a bolt from the blue. In addition to the normal industrial and commercial enterprises that suffered a fish in the pond, they suffered unprovoked losses due to the lack of cash positions, business was sluggish, and buying and selling stopped. Those friends who hedged foreign exchange interest originally wanted to fish in troubled waters, but unexpectedly, things turned out to be unexpected, and the entire deposit in the bank could not be withdrawn (limited to 500 yuan). On the foreign merchant's side, the contracts were established, there were guarantors and brokers, so they were not afraid of you being short. When the time came, they would have to settle the amount as agreed. These two days, they are also so anxious that they have no way out and cannot enter the ground. As a result, they had to raise prices and sell. For example, they used to sell in at 2 fen, but now they raised the price by 3-4 fen to let it out. After signing a contract, they turned around and asked, and the loss was several thousand or tens of thousands, and it was happening to many people. That is really the so-called "lifting a stone and pressing your own foot, losing your wife and losing your army!"</p>
<p>Therefore: I hope that the capitalists who hedge foreign exchange interest can wake up after receiving this severe blow. Instead of being used by others and doing a business that loses money, it is better to invest this money in domestic real factories. On the one hand, it can revitalize industry, benefit the country and the people. At the same time, the interest on their own funds will also have a solid guarantee. Otherwise, if you only know how to take risks and engage in speculation, the result will be losing money for nothing. "Stealing chickens won't cost you rice." What's the point of this!</p>
<h3 id="e119">Silk Floss &amp; Silver - Emergency in Silver Exchanges - Cotton Yarn Rises and Falls with Cuts - The Perception is that Double Horse Yarn at 9 Yuan from Southern Merchants Continues to Be Procured Endlessly as the Japanese Yarn Market Disappears <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Transactions in cotton yarn on the grey market are becoming increasingly active. People's minds are restless and uncertain. There are differing views on whether the market is bullish or bearish, but genuine demand is still considered strong. Merchants from South China, Hong Kong, and Guangdong continue to procure without ceasing, providing substantial support to market prices. At the opening of the market this morning, due to the impact of the silver shortage on generally speculative households, many began cutting losses, causing a noticeable panic in the market, resulting in a straight drop. Spot goods of Double Horse 20s yarn from foreign firms opened at 484 yuan, dropping straight to 473 yuan, a difference of 11 yuan. In the afternoon, there were rumors of good news boosting the market, and large firms were reportedly buying in, causing the market to recover and rise again. Double Horse 20s yarn from foreign firms initially traded at 475 yuan, 2 yuan higher than in the morning. Shortly after, buying interest surged, with reports that Xie Kang, acting on behalf of a certain party, was purchasing, tightening the market, pushing the price up to 480 yuan. Warehouse receipts were traded at 475 yuan. However, prices fell by 2 yuan by the close of trading. In total, various merchants bought a combined total of 1,395 bales for the day. The market price for Double Horse 20s yarn fell by 9 yuan, Double Globe yarn fell by 7 yuan, and 10s coarse yarn also fell by varying amounts of 3 to 5 yuan. Ningbo Hefeng Factory offered 500 bales of 10s Red Lotus Bee yarn at a price of 408 yuan. Yesterday, 1,400 bales of cotton yarn arrived from Ningbo. Today, 205 bales were shipped to Hong Kong. The amounts purchased by various merchants are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Guangdong 365 Hong Kong 20</p>
<p>Fellow Traders 888 Total 1,395</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market is largely disappearing. In reality, the discount rate for banknotes is high, and sales of Japanese yarn have always been conducted entirely on credit, which has a greater impact. As a result, transactions are difficult to settle. The price of Yueqin Wood brand 20s yarn for the current month fell to a low of 370 yuan, but recovered in the afternoon to 375 to 380 yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market was relatively active in the early morning. However, due to rumors that the government's approved agricultural relief fund included 35 million for cotton export subsidies, and that the government would announce that only new cotton would be eligible for these subsidies, market prices slightly declined. Washington also rumored that the US might exchange American cotton for Soviet manganese, but the details are unknown. Yesterday's New York market resulted in prices remaining flat, with fluctuations of 2 to 3 points. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by one rupee. Egyptian cotton rose by 3 to 5 points.</p>
<p>Transactions in foreign cotton in Shanghai have shown no improvement recently. Traders are eager to sell, but it is difficult to find buyers. Factories are not only unwilling to buy, but are also actively seeking to cancel contracts for cotton that has already been purchased but not yet shipped. Yesterday, the Yarn Mill Association held its second decision-making meeting at the Wing On Company, inviting foreign cotton firms to participate. However, due to excessive losses from currency swap issues, no progress was made. It is said that discussions will be held again within the day.</p>
<h3 id="e120">US Cotton Export Subsidies Limited to New Cotton <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Transactions in domestic cotton continue to be non-existent, and factory demand is as rare as morning stars. Huashang Xinyu Factory purchased 500 bales of White Rock 20s raw material, with prices 2 to 3 yuan lower than before. This is because the price of yarn has also fallen, naturally pulling the inter-dependent raw cotton into the vortex. As for the price of Indian cotton blocks, they remain in a state of fatigue. Most factories are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude, maintaining a weary and immobile stance. Supplies from northern Jiangsu have decreased, with only 60 bales of Tonghua cotton arriving. Today, 100 bales of cotton will be shipped to Hong Kong. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Local refined sugar down half a yuan; Huizhou white sugar up two yuan.</p>
<p>According to the London wire yesterday, the sugar market for August rose by 2.25 pence, to 7 shillings and 6.5 pence. December rose by 0.75, to 6 shillings and 3.25 pence. March of next year rose by 1 penny, to 6 shillings and 4 pence. The Dutch wire reported a rise of 5 cents for the near term, with July and August at 8.60 Dutch guilders. The long term remained unchanged. (The incorrect exchange of near-term and long-term prices the day before should be corrected.) The Timber Market Association's clearing prices showed slight fluctuations. Spot prices for 24 coarse white timber were 28.8 yuan at the native firms and 28.6 yuan at the foreign firms, both down by 0.1 yuan. Re-export goods were 20.5 yuan, down by 0.05 yuan. Da Jin Qian mark high coarse timber was down by 0.3 yuan from the previous day, trading at 29.5 yuan. Taikoo cart white timber was unchanged. Western firms' B mark was 28.7 yuan, totaling 200 bales, but downstream prices were down by another 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. DY brand was 27.5 yuan, HX mark was 27.1 yuan, and H mark red color increased by 0.4 yuan, to 19 yuan. National sugar prices saw a slight reduction in their upward momentum due to reports that the Yongjiang River was again blocked and that the Ou River was also impassable. Once the financial situation stabilizes slightly, there should be official market prices. Local refined white sugar, along with coarse white, has softened in recent days, dropping 0.5 yuan. Zhenji No. 1 was 28.5 yuan, with Nos. 2, 3, and 4 decreasing by 0.5 yuan for each successive grade. Guangdong firms offered several hundred bales of Huizhou white sugar, priced at 26.9 yuan to 25.8 yuan, about 2 yuan higher than before.</p>

<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the sudden telegram from Wenzhou merchants to stop shipments, all declared goods were withdrawn. Sales are becoming increasingly limited. Financial institutions are not allowing overdrafts, and there are no new loans being issued. The market is flooded with inventory, making turnover difficult. Business is very slow, prices are chaotic, and most off-market prices are cheap. Yesterday, Jiangxi merchants purchased over one hundred bales of fine cloth under the Shepherd Boy brand and coarse cloth of various grades from the Ewo Mill. Fine Shepherd Boy cloth was priced at 16.35 yuan for each piece on a full exchange rate basis. Guangdong merchants shipped over two thousand pieces of colored cloth and colored twill to places like Mazhang. Quanzhou merchants also experienced a slight increase in actual sales, with transactions in serge, woolen cloth, coarse cloth, colored cloth, and colored twill totaling one thousand several hundred pieces. Merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan purchased forty bales of fine cloth and fine twill from the Shenxin Fugui brand, and over one thousand pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Purchases on Mokiang Road were extremely scattered. Door sales have sharply declined, reaching less than 50% of normal levels. This shows that the purchasing power of citizens has further declined.</p>
<p>Attached is a comparative table of market prices before and after the market shutdown (items marked with a 　symbol are products of Japanese factories).</p>
<p>(Note: The prices of Chang Gui fine cloth and fine twill on the sweet 10th are spot prices, and those on the sweet 17th are factory prices. The payment methods are: 〇 for exchange, 　for cash, 　for 37 calculation.)</p>
<p>East Piece Goods</p>
<p>The market for white goods remains stagnant. A meeting was convened yesterday, but it adjourned without results. However, with the end of the month approaching, the "rubber ball" goods for this month urgently need to be settled. Some traders have individually contacted each other, and many are choosing to fulfill one of the four methods: "delivery," "settlement," "clearing accounts," or "extension." Off-market transactions in fine cloth and fine twill lack fixed standards. Longtou fine cloth is quoted at 14.5 yuan, and Wufu fine twill is offered at 13.9 yuan.</p>
<p>On the 28th, 6 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Xiamen and 54 pieces to Hong Kong. In addition, 30 pieces arrived from Hong Kong on the 27th.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Grains - Flour Clearly Fixed, Secretly Loose - New Wheat Arrivals Surge Daily <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the spot flour market presented an appearance of being clearly fixed but secretly loose. Investigations into local transactions have shown no hope of development since the emergence of the cash issue. Both northern and southern merchants have been unable to operate smoothly due to the war. However, there are rumors that northern merchants have already opened up orders for 40,000 bales, which are said to be forward flour to be delivered in Tianjin. It is also rumored that a certain party has already shipped out 100,000 bales in previous batches. If calculated at an exchange rate of 5 yuan, the factory price has secretly fallen significantly. However, yesterday, manufacturers did not accept exchange payments for local transactions, so small retail transactions in this street still require 4.65 yuan in cash, while the market already shows signs of loosening. Investigations show that 500 bales of flour were exported to Xiamen today, and 400 bales of bran were exported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the new wheat market continued to soften and decline. Arrivals along the Shanghai-Ningbo road are gradually surging. Wheat from places such as Nanjing, Caishiji, Wuhu, Danyang, and Nanxiang have all been transported here. However, at present, flour mills' interest in purchasing remains weak. Yesterday, Japanese factories slightly inquired, and local streets and wineries also made small purchases. However, those holding the goods are under pressure due to insufficient capital and the hot weather, so they are all willing to sell off their goods for cash. The market showed signs of being unable to support itself and loosened. A total of 1,400 bales of new wheat from various locations were offered for sale, with the highest price being 6.55 yuan. In addition, 500 bales of Nanxiang barley were priced at 5.9 yuan. The market price has fallen by more than 0.1 yuan from before.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Abundant Rice Market Supply <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Jing Rice: Yesterday, the source of supply from various merchants, especially the goods from Hexia, were still blocked by a certain party in Minhang, resulting in a lack of arrivals. However, in addition to nearly 2,000 bales from the Changzhou area, Wuhu Jian rice continued to arrive at the port at a rate of 2,000 to 3,000 bales per day, so Shanghai's rice supply still relied on this route to maintain it. As for the sales market, the shops on this street were still lively yesterday, but suddenly turned dull again. The situation was fatigued, and sellers eager to unload their goods were willing to lower prices to secure sales. However, there was ultimately no turnaround by noon, so prices for both thick and thin Jing rice had already depreciated by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Ke Xian Rice: Influenced by the rumors of fixed price transactions for foreign rice, and the Wuhu telegram this morning stating that the local market price had fallen sharply by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan, people's hearts softened and they sought to sell off their stockpiles. High-quality Ji Xian rice immediately fell by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Paddy rice still had some sales in the interior countryside, but only by a small amount of a few cents to 0.1 yuan. A total of 3,000 bales were offered for sale in the general market, mostly purchased by countryside traders in the interior.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: The spot market suddenly weakened yesterday. There were no inquiries for the original price of 23 yuan. Following the transaction of 300 tons of No. 1 Saigon rice the night before, rumors of a second batch of transactions circulated in the market yesterday. The Saigon rice mentioned yesterday was No. 2 rice, totaling 3,000 tons, sold through the Daufu Foreign Firm for Zhejiang, and purchased by six or seven firms that had initially committed to buying Saigon rice but later reneged.</p>
<p>Glutinous Rice: Prices remained mediocre. In general, this type of market, after the two municipal councils strictly ordered price limits, hoarders disappeared. Only scattered small amounts remained in this street for actual demand. Moreover, due to financial issues and various other factors, cargo owners lacked the ambition to defend their positions. Under these circumstances, there is no possibility of a sharp rise in the rice market, and there may even be a trend towards decline.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: The market situation has entered a normal track. There are many bean transactions.</p>
<p>Although the transaction volume in the miscellaneous grains market is small, it is entirely for genuine sales. Therefore, the overall market situation is normal, shifting with supply and demand. Prices are mostly in line with buying and selling, and are relatively stable. Yesterday, over 300 bales of Dalian yellow beans were traded, priced at 9.6 yuan, 9.5 yuan, and 9.4 yuan. About 100 bales of Wuhu beans were priced at 9.35 yuan and 9.33 yuan. 150 bales of Hankou trench beans were priced at 9.43 yuan. 200 bales of Jiading white-skinned broad beans were priced at 6.7 yuan and 6.65 yuan. 50 bales of Chongming sand broad beans were priced at 5.85 yuan. 60 bales of Nanxiang green-skinned broad beans were priced at 6.9 yuan, and 30 bales of Pinghu green-black beans were priced at 13.8 yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding export beans, 143 tons were shipped to Bombay today, 16 tons to Columbus, 160 bales to Xiamen, and 280 bales to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The market price of coal briquettes previously increased by 2 yuan per ton starting on the 9th due to soaring raw material prices. Unexpectedly, it has been repeatedly raised within ten days, reaching a total of 3 yuan, with each increase ranging from 2 to 3 yuan per ton, causing panic and chaos in the market. Non-industry players have also started hoarding. Factories have had to stop issuing orders to curb manipulation. The Coal Briquette Association announced the selling price list a few days ago. Companies selling directly from their own vehicles, Yitai Hing, Guohua, and Dongfang Coal Briquettes, were priced at 36 yuan per ton, with an additional yuan for delivery. Retail prices at stores were set at 2.1 yuan per load, but those with inventory were still selling at prices ranging from 1.9 to 2 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Silk and Tea - New Ji Li Silk Sold Gradually <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Foreign silk markets rose across the board yesterday. New York raw silk rose by 5 to 6 cents, Shanghai silk rose by 7 to 8 cents but was not sold. Guangdong silk rose by 5 cents, near-term standard silk rose by 6.5 cents, and long-term rose by 1.5 cents. Yokohama spot prices rose by 20 yuan and long-term prices rose by 19 yuan.</p>
<p>The local silk market remains sluggish. White factories have slightly negotiated spot transactions. New Ji Li silk has already been gradually sold. Yesterday, Dachang and other firms traded nearly 50 loads, with silk prices showing little change. On the 28th, 283 pieces of Huzhou silk were shipped to Europe.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Imports and Exports - More Goods from Ningbo <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's incoming goods to Shanghai included 853 bags of sugar shipped from Hong Kong, 645 bags from Shantou, and 1,150 bags from Xiamen. Goods transported from Ningbo included 710 bags of cottonseed, 1,500 pieces of cottonseed cake, 3,000 bags of cottonseed flour, 1,529 pieces of fresh eggs, 42 bags of silkworm cocoons, 132 pieces of tung oil, and 7 pieces of human hair. Regarding exported goods, 149 tons of egg yolk and egg white, and 15 tons of gallnuts were shipped to London, and 175 pieces of egg yolk and egg white were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The writing of an era expresses the spirit of that era. The content (views) and form (tone) of writing should conform to the spirit of the times: this has already become common sense.</p>
<p>However, much of the writing prevalent in our country today has not yet achieved this common sense. Some modern people insist on using classical Chinese to write about the views of ancient people, some use classical Chinese to write about the views of modern people, and some use modern Chinese to write about the views of ancient people. The first type is like a walking corpse, the second is like a living ghost of modern times, and the third is like a mummy in disguise: none of them deserve to be called true "modern Chinese"—the writing of the new era.</p>
<p>Currently, the second type of writing is the most prevalent: possessing a modern soul but acting like a living ghost, making it difficult for people to understand, truly making oneself ridiculous.</p>
<p>However, it would be fine if they were only ridiculing themselves: but they happen to occupy a considerable position in society, forcing a group of energetic young people to expend much energy to figure out those ghostly forms and shadows, and even to follow them and imitate their ghostly voices. That's a real sin!</p>
<p>In order to save the energy of cultural youths, so that it is not wasted on wrong paths but used for deeper accomplishments; and also to allow the masses who do not have much money to learn that ancient tone and style to be able to acquire knowledge and express their feelings: I want to request that all adults and gentlemen eliminate the remnants of classical Chinese and expand the modern Chinese movement:</p>
<p>(1) All university and high school entrance examinations should be limited to writing in modern Chinese: that is, to use modern language to write about modern views. Some university or high school Chinese language teachers insist on using old antiques from the Four Books and Five Classics, and even the graders only look at classical Chinese papers and not vernacular papers. Such a habit of forcing young students to go backwards must be vigorously eliminated!</p>
<p>(2) All official documents, whether reports, consultations, orders, or approvals, especially government announcements and orders, should abolish all old official styles and be rewritten entirely in vernacular.</p>
<p>(3) All social applied writing, whether letters, deeds, advertisements, invitations, etc., should abolish all inherited clichés and be rewritten entirely in vernacular.</p>
<p>(4) News and articles in newspapers and magazines should be written in vernacular to promote and popularize it.</p>
<p>Some people say that writing in classical Chinese is economical. In fact, this is not necessarily true. For example, a news item says: "... This question believes that the hope for a peaceful resolution of the Tianjin incident is very slim..." Rewritten in vernacular, it can be written as: "Here, it is believed that there is little hope for a peaceful resolution of the Tianjin incident," isn't it also possible to save a word? Many morbid moans, or new antiques full of clichés, watch them shake their heads and wag their tails without saying anything sensible, that's extremely uneconomical! Therefore, whether an article is economical depends on whether its content is substantial and whether the language is verbose. Moreover, writing in vernacular allows the author to save the preparatory work of learning to write classical Chinese, and the effort of translating vernacular into classical Chinese when writing; and it also allows the reader to save the effort of learning to read classical Chinese, and the effort of translating classical Chinese into vernacular when reading. Isn't that much more economical than writing in classical Chinese? "The literary revolution" has been advocated for more than twenty years, and yet many young students still demand to learn classical Chinese, and our country's education has still not been truly popularized; this is entirely because the new antiques prevalent in society—classical Chinese—are at work. Therefore, I urge the educational authorities, government officials, and leaders from all walks of life to issue decrees or advocate writing in modern Chinese as soon as possible. When those new antiques lose their basis in society, then the modern Chinese that conforms to the spirit of the times will naturally rise and become popular, and the "literary revolution" and "revolutionary literature" will naturally achieve further victories.</p>
<p>Although the above repeats old words, it is still worth shouting loudly. I hope everyone "knows and acts," and works hard in a down-to-earth manner.</p>

<p>— Sheng Dan</p>
<p>——Field Notes——</p>
<p>There are two routes from Shangcheng into Anhui: one is from Yuzidian to Huiqi Mountain, passing through Sidao River, which is twenty li away, which is a relatively flat main road; the other is from Sizhuadun to Suxianshi, crossing Huangtu Ridge and reaching Zao Xie He, which is the nearest shortcut, but the road is winding, the mountain slopes are steep, and it cannot be done without walking. We arrived in Shangcheng from Songbu at about 9 pm. Although there was a truck from the military supervision department to take us, we still had to get out of the car and wade through the vast stony beaches where mountain streams converged. Otherwise, if the wheels played around with the stones, you would be sure to hold a "baptism ceremony." That night, we stayed at the Dahua Hotel next to the county government. In Shangcheng, it was considered a first-class hotel, with paper windows, uneven dirt floors, and old bamboo beds, all preserving the style of the Middle Ages. However, the inferiority of the material conditions can reflect the simplicity of social life: the hard work and endurance of the people of Zhongzhou can be seen here. Moreover, the people are strong and brave. Since this resolution of organization, training, and the inculcation of political common sense, in the voice of "defend our homeland," they are all ready to rub their fists and prepare to spill their blood.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Naiqi of the Anhui Provincial Committee also stayed in Shangcheng that day; this familiar national fighter had returned to Anhui from Wuhan, passing through here, so we met. He wore a worn-out gray cloth uniform, pacing back and forth in the courtyard, and no one knew that he was a high-ranking official.</p>
<p>"Ah, where are you going?" He seemed a little surprised.</p>
<p>"Anhui," I replied, "to western Anhui!" I immediately added a sentence.</p>
<p>"Then shall we travel together?"</p>
<p>"No, we may want to go to Xinyang for investigation."</p>
<p>Then, he told us about the mobilization work of the masses here, expressing very satisfied excitement. Finally, he said that for the 150-li mountain road to Anhui, one would have to rely on a pair of feet, because western Anhui was short of both salt and rice, and it was necessary to mobilize civilians to prepare for a rainy day, so hiring sedan chairs was absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>Somehow, County Magistrate Chen Shouchang actually discovered the arrival of Mr. Zhang. Early the next morning, he came to Dahua to invite him to give a speech. We were also involved together. After the speech, we toured the entire city. This ancient county town on the border of Henan, surrounded by less than ten li, seemed very quiet because it was located in the war zone: but the people's emotions about the war of resistance were extremely tense, which could be proved by the impression gained from the lecture meeting. It is said that the old six counties belonging to Guangzhou, Henan, have always done a good job in civilian defense work due to the banditry that has plagued them for years. The baojia system is also quite complete. When the mobile war begins, Shangcheng's people's armed forces will immediately be brought into play to serve as the gatekeepers of western Anhui, which is more than enough. As proof, Shangcheng has been occupied for half a year, but the bandits have never crossed the Zao Xie He even one step. Although relying on natural dangers, it also relies on human power. Who says political work is not important?</p>

<p>— 沙鴻譯</p>
<p>Formerly, learning to fly necessarily required being in the air. Now, one can learn the methods of operation and gain the correct sensation of flying simply in a small machine on the ground. This should be credited to a new technique invented by a young man named Link of New York.</p>
<p>The Link Trainer is installed in an airtight chamber and controlled by powerful bellows. Except for the inability to fly, it can match a real airplane in every aspect and can use automatic equipment to accurately simulate all kinds of dangers in flight—such as wing icing, air resistance, etc. One will also lose altitude or enter a whirlwind just as one would in a real airplane. An incautious learner, if confined in this trainer for too long, will also experience dizziness like a skilled pilot who has been in the air for too long, requiring assistance to exit the machine upon landing.</p>
<p>The public knows too little about the Link Trainer, but it is considered standard equipment by the U.S. Aviation Trade Bureau and the Army and Navy. The Army currently possesses twenty-five of these devices. European and American commercial airlines also use this trainer to train their pilots, practice flying, and subject them to dangerous experiments at any time.</p>
<p>Link's first trainer was built in a corner of his father's organ factory. He adopted the pneumatic method used for the organ's bellows equipment. He now manufactures this device in two factories, one in Binghamton, New York, and the other in Gananoque, Ontario, Canada. In January of this year, due to a rush of orders from around the world, he quadrupled the production capacity of his Binghamton factory. The Canadian factory is currently rushing to complete orders worth a total of $1.25 million for customers throughout the British Empire. The cheapest of these trainers costs $6,000 each, and the most expensive costs $10,000 each. Link is only thirty-five years old this year, and his net worth is already close to a million. This inventor did not receive technical training in school. His experience comes from careful learning in his own factory. The manufacture of organs differs from most industrial manufacturing; its driving force is compressed air. Link focused on studying this force from childhood.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty-three, he engaged in aviation amidst the enthusiasm for aviation sparked by Lindbergh's flight to Paris. Soon, he was teaching people to fly. But flying may be considered a stressful matter on the student's part, while for the teacher, this task can quickly become a routine. A busy man like Link, engaged in this every day, found it very painful, so he conceived of a method to cultivate flying experience on the ground. He spent the winter months between 1927 and 1928 experimenting with bellows, vents, and the supporting power of air in the organ factory. By spring, he had solved this problem. He was able to create a trainer whose every movement was like that of a real airplane. Link then founded an aviation school, where anyone who agreed to pay a tuition fee of $85 could be guaranteed graduation. In 1931, the school had 150 students, but in 1932, he felt frustrated because the number of students gradually decreased, leading the school to experience losses.</p>
<p>At the same time, the number of trainers he sold was insufficient to sustain his plans: only a few were bought by aviation transportation agencies, and the number sold abroad was also scarce: only a few in the UK, and the rest sold in other parts of Europe. In 1930, the Navy purchased one, and the Army ordered six.</p>
<p>His main income, however, came from various amusement parks; he and his brother George used the trainers to perform various aviation shows in the parks. On one occasion, George was embarrassed by the audience. It turned out that they wanted to climb into the cockpit to start the machines. Link came up with a solution: he asked the audience to pay money as a reward, and then take turns "flying" in the trainer for a quarter of an hour. The audience willingly paid and took turns riding, leaving satisfied. After that, the performance venue set a visiting fee, and the daily ticket income was considerable, so his factory was able to sustain itself and grow day by day.</p>
<p>In 1934, the cancellation of airmail contracts and the accidents encountered by the Army Air Corps pilots flying mail planes made the aviation community realize the need for mechanical training—this was a matter that could not be delayed. Then Link's opportunity arrived. Day after day, people came to inquire about the use of the trainer. Since the end of 1934, the production in his factory has been increasing day by day.</p>
<p>When you enter a Link Trainer, you can feel as if you are in a real airplane. When you "ascend," the instruments clearly indicate the same as those indicated by a rising airplane. Once the airplane is in the air, you must manage altitude and fly forward, being unstable in the air. The trainer also has these sensations. Except for the inability to move forward, the trainer can realize all the fears and possibilities of flying. If one wing droops, the driver will immediately feel it, and the artificial horizon will also remind the driver. Increasing or decreasing altitude, turning left and right, all are available.</p>

<p>Pains Beyond Words</p>
<p>— 李韶年</p>
<p>By Li Shaonian</p>
<p>I occasionally have some free time, so I go to chat with a friend. Since we are both young literature enthusiasts, our conversations inevitably revolve around literature. Then we launch into a round of reckless discussions targeting the current bleak state of this isolated island. After sitting for a while, I pick up a copy of Lu Yan's "The Traveler's Heart" from his bookshelf and take my leave. The motivation for taking this book is simply that I am also a traveler. I just want to see what the heart of a so-called "traveler" is like, whether we share the same emotions that permeate our states of mind.</p>
<p>I go home. I leaf through "The Traveler's Heart." On it, I discover my friend's afterthoughts, an eight-line poem, titled "Pains Beyond Words":</p>
<p>On the white paper, a small circle is drawn,</p>
<p>Can you escape the longing for your hometown?</p>
<p>Oh, traveler's heart!</p>
<p>Falling into a small circle of pain,</p>
<p>Hoping for all comfort to come,</p>
<p>You look up and wait,</p>
<p>The bitter, suffocated traveler's heart,</p>
<p>Only seeking to enlarge that circle of life!</p>
<p>My friend reveals his homesickness in these eight lines, unable to conceal it.</p>
<p>But what about the hometown?</p>
<p>Under the fires of war, the hometown—his and mine—apart from merely a terrain resembling a rubble pile, there is only the remnant of broken tiles and bricks. Thinking of this, the symptoms of homesickness naturally become even heavier. Sometimes, one cannot help but consign some unspeakable pain between the lines, just to ease one's mind, but the melancholy still remains.</p>
<p>In fact, he lacks a firm "belief." I would never let unspeakable pain grow in my heart and gnaw at it. If things continue to develop like this, he will sink into the most severe mental illness, never able to extricate himself. To put it bluntly, he is engaging in slow suicide.</p>
<p>"The final victory belongs to us!" We abandon this unspeakable pain and make silent hopes and efforts, only then can we enlarge that circle of life, isn't that so? President Chiang announces to us: "One person's life is finite, but the life of the nation is infinite!" We must enlarge an even greater circle! (Proceeds from the sale will be donated)</p>

<p>The Yang Yuelou Abduction Case</p>
<p>There was a woman named Wang, from Wu [Suzhou], who followed the merchant Zhang with her quilt and silk. Zhang traveled to Fuliang to sell tea and did not return for years. Spring flowers and autumn moons passed, and Wang was already a middle-aged beauty. She had a daughter, about to reach the age of fifteen, still waiting to be betrothed, indeed perfectly flawless. In the Spring Theater Company there was a Yang Yuelou, who had a rather imposing appearance. Many famous courtesans flocked to him. Wang, in the lamplight of the third watch, at the end of a performance, also felt longing for him. But being elderly, she was too ashamed to recommend herself, so she used her young daughter as bait. Wang had an adopted daughter named A Shi, seventeen years of age, young and beautiful. Marrying her to Yang would be a union between two families. She wouldn't have to worry about gossip. Yang hesitated because of public opinion and dared not proceed with the marriage. Thus, on the first day of the month, just as dawn broke, while people were still asleep, Wang secretly carried A Shi out. Yang was waiting with a carriage for the beauty to board. With a flick of the whip, the carriage was gone, leaving no trace. At noon, Wang carried several large and small lacquered red boxes out, and as the sun set, she left and did not return. Zhang's family sent out scouts in all directions. The next day, they learned that Yang Yuelou was renting a place in Wenyun Lane. They immediately reported to the Guangbang Guild Hall and formally lodged a complaint with the authorities about the abduction. On the third day, Magistrate Chen immediately sent constables. The doors were closed during the day, and the constables broke in through a hole in the wall. Yang Yuelou jumped from the upper floor, caught off guard, and was captured. Wang and her adopted daughter, along with seven large and small leather suitcases, were taken into custody. At the trial, the onlookers were like a wall. The plaintiff was Wei, a relative of Wang, who recounted the abduction in detail. Yang Yuelou was summoned to face the court. Magistrate Chen, considering that the actor had enticed and abducted a woman from a good family, a heinous crime, immediately sent him to the county for further investigation. The next night, during the night trial, Yang was subjected to a hundred strokes to the feet. Wang was given two hundred lashes to the back. When questioned, A Bao stated that she would follow her husband like a hen follows a rooster and had no other intentions. She was also given two hundred strokes, and when asked about how she met Yang, she said that her mother had played matchmaker after they watched a play together. Magistrate Ye ruled that Yang had committed more than one crime. Previously, he was also a principal offender in the mass brawl at the Little East Gate. It was ordered that he be detained for further questioning.</p>

<p>After the Restriction on Withdrawals</p>
<p>— 張鎮山</p>
<p>By Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>The "Ma Electric" [an announcement by Ma Yin-ch'u], like a clap of thunder, extending to Shanghai, caused the ambitions of speculators to tremble; shattered the illusions of those hoping to evade capital; and at the same time, turned those who hoarded and manipulated prices into "heroes" with no place to use their skills, thus hopefully stabilizing and lowering the general standard of living. While we applaud this, shouldn't we laugh at those with "big bellies and wild ambitions" and watch their predicament with arms folded?</p>
<p>After the restriction on withdrawals, large depositors were indeed unable to withdraw unlimited amounts. However, these days, the banks have been extremely crowded with depositors withdrawing funds, both large and small account holders. I visited several large banks and browsed in the savings departments. In each one, the crowds of people were layered and wriggling under the windows outside the counters, waving their passbooks or receipts. The scene was like the ticket sales before a popular play in the theater. The clerks inside the counter were as busy as ticket sellers. The thunderous wind kept blowing, but it could not dispel the heat wave, nor could it disperse the sour sweat odor squeezed out of the crowd. This grand occasion was indeed unprecedented. Several savings departments even temporarily added window openings and transferred more staff to cope with the situation. Rolls of banknotes were being pushed out of the windows, some with tens of yuan, some with one or two hundred yuan, and many with five hundred yuan. Accumulating like grains of sand into a pagoda, the total number must be quite large.</p>
<p>The restriction on withdrawals originally stipulated that amounts below 500 yuan were not restricted. However, why were those small depositors also joining in the excitement? This may be attributed to rumors. The people who stir up trouble are ubiquitous. Once there is an opportunity, they will not stop using their "eloquence." Coupled with the fact that foreign banks are not bound by the ministry's orders and can pay depositors the full amount of cash, this has given the general public, especially the petite bourgeoisie, the idea of transferring their funds. These days, it's hard to believe that people withdrawing money are using it to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<p>At the same time, many of those so-called small depositors are actually not purely small depositors, but rather those transformed from large sums. This is already an open secret. Since the announcement of the "August 16th" financial stabilization measures two years ago, their funds have almost all escaped the restriction and become cash holdings. Because of the experience that small amounts are unrestricted and easier to withdraw, many wealthy people are dividing their large sums into several small amounts, creating many account names, such as: Zhang San, Li Si, Zhao Wu, Sun Liu, Zhou Qi, Wang Ba; and even names like Tian Ji, Di Ji, Ren Ji, Gui Ji, etc., coming and going, like a cunning rabbit having three burrows. Therefore, although the restriction on withdrawals is set at 500 yuan, they can withdraw an unknown number of 500 yuan each week, as long as they have enough account names, it is not difficult to turn it all into cash.</p>
<p>However, where do they put all this cash? The "smart" ones have their own ways, truly not worrying about the dangers of hoarding and inviting theft. In addition to transferring it to cash accounts, most people buy foreign exchange and deposit it in foreign banks, and some even actively purchase gold and silver, or try to hoard goods.</p>
<p>In addition, many people use safe deposit boxes to hide their cash. They take it out of the savings or current account and immediately put it into the safe deposit box they rent in the same bank. When they need to use it, they take it out, which is extremely convenient.</p>
<p>These selfish actions have a huge negative impact on the monetary system and social financial institutions, and it is even more regrettable that the general purely small depositors listen to the rumors of speculators! Generally, ambitious people or selfish people with capital should prioritize the interests of the nation and society to assist the government in stabilizing finances and the market, in order to increase the economic strength of the war of resistance. I know that saying this is like "playing the lute to a cow," but I am not willing to remain silent. I don't have time to worry about whether it has any effect, of course.</p>

<p>Written Before the Opening of the "Labor Exhibition"</p>
<p>— 亞路</p>
<p>By Ya Lu</p>
<p>"Self-reliant education is what is called labor education" Research and create to adapt to the purpose of "learning for application"</p>
<p>The middle and primary school labor exhibition initiated by the Municipal Private School Association is scheduled to open on July 4th. It is said that the scale is very large, and the proceeds from the sale of works will be used for disaster relief donations. This kind of "labor exhibition" with great significance is really unprecedented in the isolated island's education circle.</p>
<p>The bad habit of readers being clumsy with their hands and feet, and laborers not knowing how to think, and not being willing to use both hands and brain, is indeed one of the reasons for our country's backward production. Since Zhenfu [Huang Yanpei] advocated labor education in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], there have indeed been many outstanding achievements, but it is feared that there are also not a few schools that simply add one or two hours of manual courses such as earth, wood, bamboo, and paper each week as decoration. Even a few schools, when they encounter an exhibition, have to take the opportunity to hope to win praise and compete for face, and do not hesitate to buy a few ready-made things at any cost and then repackage them for display. This kind of hypocrisy that cannot produce real value is really the misfortune of the education community. For the sake of the value of education and the essence of labor, I hope that the schools participating in this middle and primary school labor exhibition must be realistic and not think that society can be deceived.</p>
<p>A famous educator once said: "Self-reliant education is what is called labor education." Because if we can make good use of our clever brains and omnipotent hands to manufacture something, as long as it meets human needs, then from the national point of view, there is no need to rely on foreign goods and let capital flow out; from the individual point of view, having a skill will not make one a social parasite or encounter possible difficulties in life.</p>
<p>The main purpose of labor education in schools is to gradually cultivate students' interest and skills in the mechanical industry; at the same time, labor education can also fully promote the national spirit. I saw some works in the middle and primary school labor exhibition in the previous year, which were rich in the meaning of "recovering lost land" and "Chinese patriotism," which of course is very able to stimulate national consciousness, and it was exciting to see.</p>
<p>It is expected that this time, the middle and primary school students will exhibit their elaborate works, which must be very meaningful and very valuable, but do not think that this is enough. We must deeply recognize that after the War of Resistance, our country's great cause of rejuvenation will depend on talents with specialized skills in all aspects of construction. Therefore, on the one hand, we must enrich knowledge of science, mathematics, and manufacturing-related patterns, and on the other hand, we must adapt to the purpose of "learning for application" and make good use of our hands and brains to continuously research, create, and invent.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that the social gentry and ladies will enthusiastically go to visit and appreciate the "Labor Exhibition" during the opening days, and give honest criticism. At the same time, I hope that they can generously donate and buy some favorite things. In that case, the suffering compatriots will also benefit a lot.</p>

<p>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</p>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>By Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Episode 13: Urging Study, Farming, and Storing Materials for the Country, Retaining the Strong and Eliminating the Weak, Selecting Seeds with a Field</p>
<p>He Shuangyu said, "Then this silkworm breeding farm has broken the plan of the Free Village not setting up factories." Zhu Fuzhang said, "Although everyone had this tacit understanding at the time, there was no rule set that the Free Village was not allowed to set up factories, because at that time no one thought of competing for land in the Free Village to set up a factory. And the people in the Free Village are all engaged in farming, and no one thought of setting up a factory. When the Provincial Agricultural Bureau sent someone to negotiate with our village, our village held various meetings and felt that we could not refuse him. Does the Free Village only allow a few people from the Free Village to live there, and not allow others to start a business? Is this kind of closed-door mentality allowed to exist in this world? Moreover, the breeding farm does not hinder our village in any way, and the Agricultural Bureau is also considering the development of the silkworm industry. Good seeds are beneficial to silkworm farmers. I remember when our Jiangsu Province's silkworm farming area was lost, the silkworm seeds were almost controlled by others. Until now, the silkworm seeds in Zhejiang and Jiangsu have gradually become excellent. There is also a saying that the breeding farm cannot be considered a purely factory; it is still an agricultural farm. At that time, it was resolved to agree. Fortunately, they do not occupy much land, and it is not necessary to be in a place with land and water transportation. The seeds produced last year were of good quality, and this year they have doubled. Who knew that double would not be enough? It is said that the seeds scheduled for next year have exceeded this year's output by one and a half times. In this way, their houses are not enough again, and they are adding to them there." He Shuangyu said, "The breeding farm is probably only busy during the silkworm season, right? After the silkworm season, it will be idle. Like now, it is idle time." Zhu Fuzhang said, "That's not necessarily true. In the past, it was originally like this. Farmers have a fixed lunar calendar. As long as they are busy through the early summer, the silkworm business is over. The ancient people's poems say, "After the silkworm and mulberry are finished, then plant the fields," which just happens to be in order, and after being busy in the early days, they are busy in the middle days. However, now silkworms are raised in the spring and summer; after the summer silkworms are raised, they are raised in the autumn. Except for the winter, when the mulberry leaves are not withered, silkworms can be raised in the other three seasons. In order to raise silkworms in three seasons, the breeding farm must prepare silkworm seeds for three seasons, so they are still not very idle. However, summer and autumn silkworms are not as many as spring silkworms. Just like in our village, we only raise spring silkworms, but they don't raise silkworms for the other two seasons. And besides raising silkworms and feeding mulberry, there is also a lot of other work to do. The seed selection part requires a lot of people. They all have to be specialized people, all of whom have graduated from silkworm industry schools. These jobs are all done by ladies!" (148)</p>

<p>Recently, the increase in the cost of living in Shanghai is unprecedented. Needless to say, rents, other things like rice, oil, vegetables, clothing, and all daily necessities, have suddenly increased in price. For example, bok choy, not long ago sold for only three or four cents a catty, now requires 20 copper coins. Matches are now sold for two cents a box… No matter what the item, the price has reached an abnormal height. Life on this isolated island is currently extremely difficult!</p>
<p>The cost of living continues to increase, but we must think of a way to save it. I have always advocated that in addition to doing our best to save, we should promote a waste exchange movement. The practical method is to exchange my waste for others’ waste that I need. In this way, there is no need to buy it with money, but to promote this movement, it must be expanded in scope in order to be effective.</p>
<p>Now a service agency that meets the above conditions has appeared, that is, the "Household Goods Exchange" recently attached to the Shanghai Women's and Youth Service Department on Jing'an Temple Road in the YWCA, and it is completely a service nature. However, it only sells new and old items on behalf of others, but we can bring our own unused items to consign there. The money earned can then be used to buy our own needed items there, so aren't the waste products that everyone doesn't need all exchanged for practical items? I think the establishment of this agency is very suitable for the current needs. I am happy that this is the gospel that the residents of the isolated island are happy to hear, and even more joyfully comforts my hope that it has now been realized.</p>
<p>Walking into the agency, it is really like being in a department store. All the items that should be used in the family are there, and they are displayed by category, such as silk, cloth, clothing for all seasons, shoes and hats, Chinese clothing, Western clothing, toys, both new and old are available. Each item is marked with a price. These items are all consigned from the outside world, and the agency only charges some handling fees necessary for expenses.</p>
<p>The most commendable thing about the agency is that both new and old goods can be sold on consignment. Then from now on, if there are extra items at home, it is a pity to discard them, so we can entrust them to the agency for sale, which is more cost-effective than selling them to old goods collectors. At the same time, if we lack any items, buying new ones is not enough economic power, and buying old ones is not easy to buy, then we can go there to choose and buy. Fortunately, everything is available there, and the prices also have a certain standard, and you will never suffer a loss. It is really both convenient and economical.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the "Household Waste Exchange," it has been quite crowded with consignors and buyers, which shows how much the agency is needed! We hope that people who are enthusiastic about social welfare will come together to initiate and set up several item exchange agencies with the same nature, which will at least reduce the burden on the lives of the residents of the isolated island.</p>

<p>— Only Me</p>
<p>Bidding Farewell to Mao and Welcoming Yan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the era, the Golden Company originally intended to retain Gao Shenglin, Guan Shengxi, and Qiu Shengrong of the "Sheng" generation, and pair them with Yan Jupeng, who had been performing since the previous era. Among them, Guan Shengxi had already been in Shanghai for a long time since he came with Zhang Eyun the previous time, and his heart was set on returning home, so he did not want to continue performing in Shanghai. Gao Shenglin, Qiu Shengrong, and the young actor Jiang Shiyu remained. The reason why the Golden Company wanted to keep a group of people was that Yan Jupeng did not bring many supporting actors. Besides the female role Hao Zhu and Hou Yulan, there were only Ma Yunkun and Wang Fushan. Now, let's talk about Hou, Ma, and Wang for the time being:</p>
<p>Hou Yulan</p>
<p>Ms. Hou is twenty-one years old this year. Her father's name is Yueting, and he is an amateur performer. Yulan loved Peking opera since she was a child. When the Peking Opera School was established, Yulan enrolled in the school. The school produced many talents, especially Zhao Jinrong, Song Dezhu, and Hou Yulan among the female roles, who are truly rare talents in recent times. Yulan is excellent in both character and academics. She took the exam three times and always came out on top. The principal of the opera school, Jin Zhong, praised her as the most outstanding talent in the school. Zhao Jinrong and Song Dezhu left the school before Yulan. After Zhao and Song left, Yulan held the fort alone and became the mainstay of the school. Last winter, Yulan also graduated. She originally intended to form her own troupe, but it did not work out for some reason. Then, she was invited by the Sheng actor Xi Xiaobo. Since Yulan started working with Xiaobo, her reputation has grown even more, showing a remarkable progress. Because Yulan is a disciple of Cheng Yushuang, people in old Beijing often called her "Female Inkstone Partner." Yulan's art was personally taught by Yushuang, and she gained a lot of experience in learning the Cheng style. Yulan's performances of Cheng's masterpieces are vivid and lifelike, almost indistinguishable from Yushuang's. Yulan's voice is very sweet, and her appearance is also excellent. This time, coming with Jupeng, she will definitely be very popular among the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Ma Liankun</p>
<p>Liankun specializes in "Jiazi Hua" (painted face roles). He was a student of the "Fu Liancheng" opera school and was considered a top student in the second class. Among the "Jiazi Hua" talents from Fu Liancheng, Hou Xirui was the first to become popular. After Hou, there was only Liankun. (There were many "Jiazi Hua" talents in the second class of Fu Liancheng, including Wang Lianpu, Liu Lianrong, and Su Lianhan, among whom Ma Liankun was the first to emerge.) Liankun's art combines the strengths of Hou (Xirui) and Hao (Shouchen). His "Jiazi" demeanor is the best. He also has considerable skill in martial arts, and his singing and reciting are also commendable. Liankun's "white-faced" plays have a good reputation. His art is suitable for working with Sheng actors. Several years ago, Tan Fuying relied on him as his right-hand man. Now that he is coming with Jupeng, I can't help but congratulate Jupeng, because with Liankun, he will definitely achieve the effect of green leaves complementing the peony.</p>
<p>Wang Fushan</p>
<p>Fushan specializes in "Chou" (clown roles). He is the son of Wang Shuanzi (Changlin), a descendant of a prominent family, not comparable to ordinary people. Fushan's art was personally taught by Shuanzi, so he is proficient in both civil and martial arts. Fushan's art is above the average clown actors of the younger generation. Although his voice is not loud, it has strength. He is at a disadvantage because of his height, and his appearance is not attractive. However, his martial arts are excellent, and his movements are flexible. Fushan followed his father's footsteps and played with Yang Xiaolou, so he had more opportunities to perform martial clown roles than civil clown roles. Therefore, Fushan's martial clown plays are better than his civil clown plays. Although his civil clown plays are also worth watching, he is better at performing mischievous plays. It may be difficult for him to satisfy people in the "robe and belt" clown roles. Judging from Yan Jupeng's repertoire, it would be best to pair him with Yao Cirui or Quan Rudanghui for clown roles. Fushan does not seem to be the right match.</p>
<p>The above three are the supporting actors who came with Yan Jupeng. It seems that there is a lack of an inside old man. However, the Golden Company has a large number of talents, so there should be no difficulty. As for Jupeng's arrival, it is expected to cause a sensation. Jupeng has not been seen in Shanghai for ten years, let alone his heroic appearance ten years ago. In terms of Jupeng's art, he is truly worthy of being called the "Orthodox Tan School" and "Unique in Rhythm." Fuying is good, but to hear a Sheng play with a truly Tan flavor, Jupeng is definitely the best. Recently, Sheng actors Nanlin (Lintong) and Beima (Lianliang) are the most popular. No one intends to revive the Tan style. Listening to Jupeng's singing, we will surely have a refreshing experience.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Dorothy Lamour Wears Chinese Fashion on the Screen <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Fengxiang</p>
<p>Ms. Li Xiaqing Lent Her Clothes</p>
<p>Paramount Company Did Not Spend a Cent</p>
<p>The famous Hollywood actress Miss Dorothy Lamour belongs to Paramount Pictures. Recently, the company is filming "Disputed Passage." In the film, Miss Lamour plays an American orphan raised by Chinese foster parents, so she will wear Chinese women's costumes to perform on the screen. With such a graceful Western beauty, plus oriental costumes, we imagine that this fusion of Chinese and Western virtues will definitely have a unique peak.</p>
<p>As for the Paramount Company authorities, they did not spend a cent for Miss Lamour's "Chinese costumes," because our Chinese female aviator Ms. Li Xiaqing is currently flying across the United States. In addition to her life in the air, she also travels around Hollywood, spending her silver lamp life. In this film, she is making her debut. Her friendship with Miss Lamour is very good, as close as sisters. Their body shapes and sizes are similar, so borrowing clothes is not a problem. It is said that Ms. Li has more than a hundred Chinese-style clothes, such as cheongsams, which is enough for Miss Lamour to choose and use.</p>

<p>— New Film</p>
<p>——Now Showing Everywhere in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Recently, a Soviet scientific blockbuster "The Depth of the Sea" has been completed and is being screened in major cities in the Soviet Union. All the shots in this film were taken underwater, all of which are the dynamics of marine life. The film's photographer wore swimming clothes and dived into the seabed, using a microscopic camera to capture the structure of the smallest organisms under the sea. The interest is particularly focused on tassels, flounders, needlefish, and the mimicry of crabs, especially the methods of changing mimicry at different depths below the seabed. However, some accidental events are not easy to capture on camera, such as the sea anemone unfolding to capture small fish, mostly in dark places. However, hunger sometimes forces them to change their habits and snatch food in bright places. In this way, the photographer gets the opportunity to capture the snatching action on camera. This film was directed by three famous professors of experimental biology, Libiteff, Vodensky, and Nikitin. Although it is a purely scientific film, in the Soviet Union, which advocates science, such a film will give everyone the opportunity to see it.</p>
<h3 id="e141">A Brief Discussion of Yan Shishan <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Sheweng</p>
<p>Yan Shishan, the martial female lead of the Golden Company, has a longer performance period this time and will return to Beiping with Mao Shilai. Now, let's briefly talk about everything about her.</p>
<p>Shishan is the niece of Jiujin Feng and inherited from her family. Although she graduated from a formal opera school, she also has a family education. Her appearance and movements are rarely matched. Her art is extremely beautiful. Plays such as "The Hujia Village" and "Stealing the Treasure Herb" are her masterpieces. Her "Dachu Shou" (fighting scenes) are also complete, stable and clean. If she had not had a solid foundation, how could she have achieved this? It is a pity that many martial female lead plays have not been staged. The repertoire of the Golden Company is too dense, so many plays cannot be staged in time. Her salary is very unclear. Shishan's voice is already brighter than Chun Kui, and she often practices singing long passages to train her voice. She also learns some Qingyi and Huadan plays and can learn them wholeheartedly. Everyone who knows her says that she will soon compete with Shi Lai and Song Dezhu on the stage. It is expected that after she returns to Beiping, she will focus on shirt plays. When she comes to Shanghai again in the future, she will surely change her style. Her friend Lv Gong has high expectations for her, because her material is excellent, and she is truly the only one in the younger generation. I once took a photo of her performing at the Golden Company to leave an impression for those who love Yan.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Yan Shishan's Stealing the Treasure Vault <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Fall of Layman Woyun and the Progress of Li Duokui</p>
<p>When he shared the stage with Yan Jupeng, the Zaqu world praised their acting and recitation for being very similar to the old masters. Sometimes his voice was clear, and he cut corners, but the audience still did not make a fuss or boo him. However, he later felt guilty and was embarrassed to continue singing, so he soon resigned. Since the death of the old master and the fall of Woyun, Li Duokui has unintentionally become the leader in the Laodan (old female) scene. At the same time, since the deaths of Fu Shan, Wen Liangchen, and the work-based Lao Dan, only Chen Wenqi and Sun Futing remain. It is also said that Mr. Lu Wu is now nearly seventy years old. Among those who specialize in Lao Dan's Huqin (Chinese violin), no one has been heard of inheriting Lu's mantle until now, which is also a great regret in the opera world. Li Long and I have not been to Shanghai for a long time. I would like to persuade them to quickly accept a few disciples when they come to the south, so as to avoid the danger of losing the Lao Dan and Lu school of Huqin.</p>
<p>Master Hongdou is Able to Do Everything, Civil and Military, Kunqu and Other Arts</p>
<p>No one in the north and south opera circles does not know the names of Master Dongwu (Pu Xiguo), Master Wangsi (Junzhi), and Master Chenshier (Yanheng). However, Chen and Wang specialize in the Tan style. Wang's voice is excellent, and he can often be seen on the Hongdoushe stage. Master Shier does not have a voice, but his humming of the Tan style is very charming. In addition to singing and pronunciation, Chen has also deeply studied the Qin (Huqin), chess, calligraphy, painting, and drums, all following Dai Chunshi, and can imitate him to the point of confusion. Some people say that when he is in financial difficulties, he puts Dai Chunshi's signature on his own works and sells them for a high price. I once preserved several of his fan paintings and letters, and will publish them later so that everyone can appreciate them. The public knows his name in Qin, but in fact, this gentleman is a talented and elegant person. Unfortunately, he and Junzhi both passed away several years ago. Now, only Mr. Xiyuan remains among the three old men, and he also lives on the isolated island. I think those who aspire to study opera arts should quickly seek advice from him and not miss the good opportunity. (47)</p>

<p>(5) Peking Opera</p>
<p>Among the various arts in the entertainment world, "Peking Opera" can be said to be the one that has lasted for a long time and always has a large number of audiences.</p>
<p>Like literature, it is also divided into "Beijing" and "Shanghai" styles. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. We cannot arbitrarily promote "Beijing Dynasty" or "Shanghai School".</p>
<p>However, according to the older Peking Opera fans, they always feel that the "typical predecessors" are gradually being lost, which is the most poignant page in the "Unofficial History of the Pear Garden"!</p>
