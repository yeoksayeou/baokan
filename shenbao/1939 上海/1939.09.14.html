<h3>攻佔華沙企圖成泡影　德軍變更戰略擬採新攻勢　波軍收復洛滋重鎭據險建立新陣地　雨季轉瞬降臨德機械部隊將失效用</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　據波蘭傳來可恃消息、波蘭軍已奪回華沙西南八十二哩之洛滋要鎭、而波蘭軍之在波士南與波摩士境內有被截斷之危險者、現已與華沙西南之波蘭軍主力隊取得聯絡、（十三日中路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　在三百英里長陣綫上之波軍抵抗力、顯已增强、彼等在聖河布格河那萊甫河不獨已成立新陣地、同時更具有阻止德軍再進之決心、行軍被阻之後、故現圖由南北雙方包抄布格河波軍之方法、（十三日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　目下一般人對於東綫之注意、均已集中於德軍之進攻西里西亞重鎭普爾齊末西爾、衆信德軍此舉、係在截斷波蘭與其南鄰各中立國之交通、德軍北面攻勢之出發點、係屬東普魯士、其目的在估領貝里斯多克之重要鐵路交叉點、現時各方人士、皆評論德國空中優勢之重要性、據波方之估計、德軍共使用飛機五千架、其中三千架係轟炸機、日前波蘭已喪失其西南工業區域、關於軍火之接濟、已成為嚴重問題、同時據此間觀察家宣稱、德國似已感覺欲肅淸波蘭西部、殊非易事、因華沙以西、現有勇敢作戰之波軍、從事活動也、此路波軍之奮勇、已博得「敢死隊」之美譽矣（十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　波蘭戰事於已往三日中、有重要發展、而使波蘭境內之衝要細地有顯著更變、據華沙今日由無綫電廣播官報稱、最近之發展為波摩士區（亦稱波蘭波美拉尼亞或走廊）中波軍之出險、及波蘭西部波士南農業省中波軍之得以撤退、據另一波蘭消息稱、德軍司令已放棄武力佔領華沙之意、並令機械化部隊停向波京前進、而德軍已在波軍陣綫兩端開始新攻勢、惟據波蘭官方聲稱、德軍現被遏止、未能作寸進、另一波蘭消息宣稱、已克復星期日德軍所佔華沙西南八十二哩之實業要鎭洛滋、波蘭人士相信德軍決定暫時放棄佔據華沙之企圖、乃因退出「波士南袋」區之波蘭大軍集中洛滋與維斯杜拉河間所致、聞波摩士境內波軍、係擊破銜接德國本部與東普魯士之德軍陣綫而脫出者、此乃重要之戰果、脫身之道、厥唯通過前面德軍也、聞此等走廊境內之波軍衝過德軍後、已與波軍主力取得聯絡、現會同與德軍作戰、惟戰况如何、尚未可知、聞波士南省波軍係與阻其東退之德軍迭起激戰後退出、撤退時秩序井然、不僅已與華沙東南之彼軍取得聯絡、且已得達洛滋、又據波蘭官報稱、華沙守軍對於圖取京城之德軍、迭次出擊獲勝、其他各綫德軍刻均被遏止、不能續作寸進、德國空軍因受重創、其活動顯已鬆弛云、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　軍事觀察家今日均對於德軍在波蘭境內前進之顯著的弛緩、皆予以注意、有謂此必德軍遙長交通綫、或已感受危險所致、計德軍每日前進、平均為二十哩、接濟困難、此雖在機械化部隊、亦屬速率過高、結果致軍隊衰疲、尤以坦克車與重裝甲軍為然、以其耗油最甚也、波軍今乃因此而得掘壕扼守之機會、以致戰事、或將暫成相持不下之僵局、惟觀察家對此不許作樂觀、華沙以西長一百二十哩南北闊五十哩所謂「波士南袋」境內之波軍、被德軍兩面包圍、其地位令人焦灼、在德軍戰略中、前未為人注意之鐵路兩條、即北為柯尼斯堡至貝里斯多克綫、及南為克拉科至林堡綫、今則大堪注意、蓋此兩綫、大有助於德軍以發展其向維斯杜拉與布格兩河間波軍新陣地之左右側攻也、惟此後天氣、對於波軍有極大便利、據每日郵報稱、波蘭亢旱三閱月、昨日突降大雨、已使德軍重機械化部隊、頗感困難云、駐英波蘭大使館未能　實此說、惟稱、每年此時輙降雨云、溯自拿破崙時期以來、波蘭向以土地泥濘聞名、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>軍民保衛華沙</h3>
<p>瑞士巴斯爾「巴斯爾日報」立陶宛京城訪電陳述華沙之防衛情形、謂華沙人民無論婦孺老弱、無不協助以舊電車火車及空襲後破碎瓦　堆成障礙物以保京城云、該報柏林訪電稱、德軍方面預料德軍在華沙四週戰事中將受重創、因波軍化整為零、在德軍陣綫後不斷的擾亂德軍後方故也、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>德方損失重大</h3>
<p>瑞士匯利希城　據可靠消息、德軍在波蘭國境內所受損失、以視公報所發表者遠為重大、死傷人數亦遠在預計之上、故醫士看護均感不敷、頗有傷兵因不獲及時救治而卒致殞命者、維也納城醫院與各小學校現均滿住傷兵、此外、德軍所俘波蘭國士兵為數不多、可見波軍抵抗極為猛烈、寗死不屈云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>德軍後方之拉多姆城附近　頃據德國軍事家估計、自戰事爆發以來、德軍傷亡總數、當在一萬二千名與一萬五千名之間、而前昨二日內、其損失最為重大、蓋德軍向拉多姆城聖河及布格河推進時、激戰甚烈也、又據德國官方統計、德波最初接觸之一星期內、前綫又有激戰、故拉多姆及聖河附近之軍陣、必有重大損失、（十三日美聯社特派員電）</p>
<p>丹京　德國坦克車軍官一員對政治報柏林訪員述及波蘭戰情、估計德軍死傷者已達一萬五千名、波軍死傷至少十倍於此、又稱、德軍因不能拘禁俘虜、故在戰時俘獲之波兵、不得不悉予槍斃、波人作戰至勇、德國欲征服波蘭、殊匪易事云、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>戈林視察前綫</h3>
<p>（柏林）　戈林上將昨日前往總司令部晋謁希特勒元首、對於德國空軍在波蘭境內之活動情形、及渠任國防閣員會議主席後所採取之計劃、作兩小時之報吿、旋即乘坐飛機、飛往華沙與喀爾巴阡山之間某處地方、視察當地附近正在作戰之空軍、（十三日海通電）</p>
<h3>空軍濫施轟炸</h3>
<p>（柏林）　德國空軍繼續向維斯杜拉河東之公路、橋梁、及鐵路施行轟炸、克利斯梯諾泊爾火車站中、有火車三節均已中彈起火、畢阿拉·波德拉斯克飛機廠亦中彈延燒、（十三日海通社電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　此間官方於今晚宣稱、德國空軍各部隊、今日在古特諾附近參戰、頗有助於陸軍之進展云、薩姆波爾至勒姆堡、斯脫里奇至勒姆堡、克拉斯尼克至魯勃林、華沙至貝里斯多克各鐵路、已被炸斷、自華沙通往東面及東北面之大路中、波蘭軍隊與車輛、曾遭襲擊、（十三日海通電）</p>
<h3>德對波戰事　不能速戰速決　揚言將轟炸不設防城市　東西兩綫擬再增加兵力</h3>
<p>（柏林）　據德國最高軍事方面今日發出公吿稱、德國必不惜以任何可能之方法、摧毀波蘭之抵抗力、此其意義即在轟炸不設防之城市、逼使波蘭屈膝、據元首行營中發出消息、波蘭各地方長官與軍官、現皆命令各城鎭村落中之平民抵抗德軍、德方用兵之初、原表明不欲轟炸不設防之城鎭、惟假若此等城鎭轉成戰塲、當然又當別論、此項責任、應由波蘭政府及其軍事領袖負之、又謂德軍機械化部隊今日已在華沙之東、突破波軍之陣綫向南推進、冀圖切斷保衛華沙波軍之後路、在加里西亞方面推進之波軍、現繼續進擊波軍、又聖堡與克拉科維已為德軍佔領、德軍前鋒已達洛窩、（十三日美聯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　據此間軍事專家觀察、戰事發展至現階段、德國對於東西兩戰綫、實有再行增加兵力之必要、聞希特勒決定再召集二百二十五萬人、其中一百萬人則開往西綫增援、另有一百萬人則派往波蘭、以便從速摧毀波蘭之抵抗力、唯截至現時為止、德國尚未徵用奧捷之人力、就德兵之被俘者觀、年齡殊不齊一、可見其後備軍與正規軍與靑年軍固皆已動用及之也、（十三日美聯電）</p>
<h3>德軍戰報　誇稱勝利</h3>
<p>（柏林）　德軍司令部本日發表文吿稱、東路德軍之南北兩翼、昨日繼續追趕敵軍、三柏爾及雅佛洛夫兩地均被佔領、德軍先鋒隊已達冷堡、困於拉多姆城南部之波軍已被擊潰、戈德堡附近陷於重圍之波軍五師及騎兵兩師、企圖突圍均未成功、德軍正在集中攻擊、德軍已衝過華沙東面及東南之公路、並越過由華沙赴西德爾斯李托夫斯克北四十公里、波軍第十八師由冷堡向南撤退、行動遲緩、現在布格河北與德軍作戰、（十三日海通電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　半官機關德意志通信社頃發表戰報稱、（一）波蘭國中路部隊、在拉多姆城南面被我軍包圍之後、其抵抗力量業被擊毀、此役我方俘獲甚衆、幷截獲大批戰利品（二）南路我軍乘勝向朗貝爾城進攻（三）東南路我軍業已佔領桑波爾城、開抵特尼斯台河南岸、同時摩托化部隊、則已攻陷克拉科維克城云、（十二日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>電流控制　機關槍　德軍在西綫　使用新武器</h3>
<p>（香港）　東京電、「日日新聞」巴黎訊、據法國官方宣稱、西綫德軍現以電流「遙控制」之機槍防禦法軍之進攻、東京帝國大學機械工程敎授山內博士稱、彼曾聞得此項武器、曾在外國試騐、但未聞其能應用於軍隊、此項機槍想係以遠處發電機控制云、但能否用以突擊敵軍、尚成問題、遙控制之辦法亦曾設計應用於高射砲云、（十三日電）</p>
<h3>德中年壯丁　迫上戰塲　身經兩大戰役　靑年多留後方</h3>
<p>阿姆斯特丹　據荷蘭報紙柏林訪電、德國四十七歲與四十八歲男子現已被徵入伍、此輩大都曾參加二十餘年前世界大戰者、德政府不欲調用工業界極有用處之壯丁、致擾亂國內經濟生活、且以靑年男子多未受軍事訓練、故覺不如調用中年男子之較為得計也、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>倫敦撤退　政府機關　閣員仍留京辦公　巴黎動物園遷移</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　據官塲消息、政府若干機關、凡可不必設於首都而能照常辦公無損其效率者、今將由倫敦移往他處、聞隨之遷出倫敦者約有七八千人、至於政府本身則仍留倫敦、凡與戰時事務有直接關係者、槪不遷移、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>比京　巴黎動物園亦已仿照倫敦之辦法、全部撤退、最珍貴之動物業已運往各省、各種毒蛇及不甚重要之動物已加屠戳、（十三日海通電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　首相張伯倫今日在下院宣稱、不日將設一般政部云、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>西綫砲聲震天　英軍參加作戰　法軍進迫齊格斐陣綫　德軍猛烈反攻被擊退</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　據此間發表之法國軍報稱、今日英軍第一次在西境陣綫作戰、配備精良之大批英軍現正在參戰云、今晚法國各報皆於顯著地位、登載英軍受砲火洗禮之消息、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　總司令部頃發表第十九號戰報稱、「昨日雙方空軍均甚活躍、敵方砲隊竟夜轟擊」云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　據此間消息、自法軍佔領華恩台特森林、前進之勢更趨明顯之後、薩爾白魯根已切實感受威脅、據法軍總司令部宣稱、法軍目下正在萊因及摩希爾間繼續進展、並使用坦克車多輛云、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　據此間有資格各界聲稱、此次英軍運至法境、復如一九一四年然、全未為德方偵覺、惟在今日無綫電盛行、及可由天空作長距離攝影時代、保守秘密之困難、遠勝於上次運兵、此間軍事觀察家皆以為今日之英國遠征軍、就其數量與配備之觀點而論、皆較上次大戰開始時運往法國者更為重要、新遠征軍尚未有參戰者、據軍事觀察稱、德原圖藉荷蘭與比利時以保護其兩翼、而固守廬森堡與瑞士間之防禦工程、以逸待勞、但此種計謀、已為法國之戰略所破壞、在第一星期中、法國之戰略、迫令德軍毫無掩護、於是法軍乃安然前進、法軍總司令甘茂林將軍已藉此造成一種陣式、幾處於重防之巔、早近聞當可藉此防務開啟切實進攻之各綫、各觀察家又皆以為德軍為攻擊波蘭計、已將西格斐陣綫之防軍抽調東發、故他日或將感覺難以扼守其舊駐之陣地、目前戰事之發動力、實操於法軍之手云、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　際此波軍對德軍施以頑强之抵抗時、法軍已對德軍加以極大之威脅、已衝入馬奇諾防綫與齊格斐防綫中之「無人地」、法軍前綫已自摩塞爾河進至萊茵河、尤以在摩塞爾流·薩爾前綫·及伏斯基地方三處、法軍獲得極大進展、伏斯基地方之法軍前綫、已越過德境而直迫齊格斐防綫、昨日為瑪恩大戰之二十五週紀念、法軍繼續　飛大元帥之精神、對德軍反攻、施以痛擊、德軍自攻薩爾摩塞爾間馬奇諾防綫之三角陣地失敗後、軍力已大見削弱、西綫之戰事重心、已移至摩塞爾河與薩爾河之間、昨日此間發表之戰報謂、「薩爾白魯根與勃立斯加斯太爾間之十二英里中、雙方不斷接觸、德軍反攻雖烈、但法軍始終保持優越地位、德軍部以其最精銳之軍隊三師進攻、獲得極大勝利、（十三日美聯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　名記者莫理斯頃在小巴黎人報　續評論法德兩國戰事形勢、略謂、「我軍對於薩爾勃魯克城所進行之攻勢、日益具體化、該地係德國工業重要中心、茲已受有嚴重威脅、居民正在疏散中、此外、薩爾勃魯克城飛行塲被我軍砲隊轟擊一事、曾由德國公報予以承認、我軍砲隊在最近二十四小時內、對於該城四郊與飛行塲西北面一帶地方、不斷加以轟擊、預料德軍退出該城改守北面陣地之時期、已不在遠」云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>上海物價的高漲</h3>
<p>近幾天來上海的物價，又在迅速高漲中。這次漲價的不祇是由海外輸入的舶來品，不祗是日常生活上所必需的米油柴炭等國貨，連各種公用事業也跟着漲價。並且市面上還有一部分商店，或則限制某類貨物的售量，或竟暫行停止某類商品的出售；這種情勢的發展，對於上海居民的影響，自然至重且大。上海自經﹁八一三﹂的砲火破壞之後，各種工商業並未恢復正常的繁榮；大部分的居民，亦未恢復其原來的生產能力；社會上是否能負担這繼續不斷的經濟重壓，這是大衆所關心的一大問題。</p>
<p>物價的漲落，本常決之於商品的供給和需要；國內幣值的變動，也能予以相當的影響；這是經濟上的一種自然現象。一般人以為最近上海物價的暴漲，係起因於黑匯市價暴縮之後，又逢歐戰發生，上海交通的困難，這當然都具有充足的理由；但究其實際，還有一個不可忽視的原因，便是一般商民的心理作用。在少數工商業經營者的投機心理中，他們憧憬於第一次歐洲大戰期内的易獲巨利，乃故意抬高各種徉貨的售價；甚至於寗可暫時停止交易，而將各種洋貨予以囤積；他們希望像過去一樣，如顏料和引綫之類，價格高漲到四百倍以上；但是他們却沒有知道現時這次德國的經濟和軍事能力，遠不如昔，未見得能夠維持上次歐戰那樣長久。同時他們又鑒於遠東局勢的飄忽不定，也有藉口國貨運輸困雖而將價格提高的。此外－般普通居民，因為物價不斷的高漲，受着恐懼心理的支配，為避免繼漲增高的損失計，盡力儲備生活所必需的各種用品；這種需要的突然增加，自然加速了物價的高漲。本報曾一再提示過，今日的上海，己非復第一次歐洲大戰期內的上海：往昔的上海，在經濟上有廣大的內地相連繫，所以歐亞交通斷絕之後，反促成上海工商業的極度繁榮，於是上海工商業界所迫切需要而國內又不能生產的一部分原料和工具，牠的價格得以大漲特漲。可是現在的上海，是在特殊環境之下存在着，對於淪陷區域的經濟關係，簡直是一種冒險的工作；對於內地的商業，又因特殊關係而受嚴厲的限制。比較上自由的，祇有對國外的貿易，假如上海的海外交通斷絕，事實上必將成為眞正的孤島；那時上海所需要的原料，固然無從採辦，就是上海的商品，也將沒有市場可以推銷；高價的洋貨又有何地可以出售，各種的日常用品也未必能在高價下隨便買賣。總而言之，由投機心理所造成的物價飛漲，不僅是一種幻想，而且是一種自殺政策。至於普通居民的儲備商品，也是近於愚昧；因儲備的商品消耗完畢之後，豈不同樣又要遭受物價高漲的影饗；何况儲備以物價繼漲增高為理由，而是否繼漲增高，根本是一個疑問。</p>
<p>在非常時期物價的高漲。本是一件平常的事。中日戰爭發生後，中國內地的物價，就較戰前為高，這次歐戰爆發後。英法等國的物價，也是立即升上。物價如此提高，乃是各產業部門的一致傾嚮，影饗於一般人民生活的，此較微小；而且在政府統制之下，自有適當的處置辦怯，決不會聽其引起重大的社會危機。可是現在的上海，因其具有複雜的國際關係。無形中已成一自由都市；中國政府的法令暫時無法執行，祇得一任少數奸商市儈在市面上從事投機活動；加以上梅的工商業在目前情况下，又不能和任何地方發生密切連繫關係。久未獲得解決的食米問題。就是一個很好的例子。</p>
<p>過去我們曾要求租界負責治安的當局，嚴厲監視上海的經濟活動，又曾要求投機商人，以人類的同情，放棄趁火打刦的企圖，但以事實所限，收效極微。其實斤斤於上海如何如何，本無多大意義；根本還應不管上海安全如何，物價如呵，儘量前往西南，深入內地。以自己的勞力和金錢，建築未來的樂園。若欲解決戰時民族工商業的困難問題。也祗有儘力資本內移，以免遭受特殊環境種種的壓榨和壓迫，同時還可受政府種種的帮助和獎勵，那就不僅可以解脱在上海所能遭遇到的剝削，而且可以充分担負国民本位的责任。</p>

<h3>洪水襲擊中　日軍遭受重大損失　日籍小商人大都將破產　冀中各城鎭日軍多撤退　中日戰事或有意外結束</h3>
<p>字林報八月三十一日北平通訊云、自一年前漢口與廣州淪陷後至今、華北日人在政治上·經濟上·與軍事上之地位、已有顯著更變、當時失此兩市、使有智識華人對中政府之堅持力與最後勝利之信心、大爲搖動、而日人對於吳佩孚願在華北成立眞正穩固之政府、希望頗高、然此種希望、不久郎開始消滅、而欲在華北成立一團結之親日國、乃成一塲春夢</p>
<p>其故有三、一因日軍各派間、意見不合、二因日人之金融政策、使華北陷於經濟混亂、三因日軍未能消滅華北遊擊隊、至今成立華北獨立國之希望、較昔更屬渺茫矣、一年前、日聞資本將達日金無數萬元的公司之復興大計劃與敷設鐵路·開闢汽車路·以及開發鑛產等大計割、天津近郊、確已造成許多工廠、而日人小店主與商人、亦接踵而來華北、携少許積蓄、希望在華北致富、然至今此等計劃、絕無實行者、日籍小商人、大多數行將破產</p>
<p>此種事態之發生、其主因爲日方軍事專家取攻擊法幣政策、而陷華北金融於極度混亂中、「聯準幣」暴跌、使日元隨之跌價、擬從事復興工作各公司之日元資本、今至少須較一年前所宣佈者、增加一倍、鐵路交通、爲最顯著的惡化徵兆之一、已往二十五年來、從未有如目下之雜亂無章者、此種雜亂、當然一部份係今夏華北所遇洪水有以致之、然在洪水破壞鐵路交通前、各種火車車輛、均已奇缺、日人無必要之外匯、遂不能購買車輛補充之、尤甚者、爲天津水災</p>
<p>使日人大受經濟損失價値日金數百萬元貨物與所貯大量軍需、均已毀壞、日租界中房屋數百幢、必須重造、許多新建工廠、毀壞至重、已屬完全無用、數千日籍小商人、資本盡失、最甚者、為二百萬顧客、已失其購買力、冀南木年棉收全毀、然日軍出發來華胃險時、用以引誘日商界之餌、華北原棉卽其一也、日軍進行肅淸游擊隊運動、已逾一年、迄無顯著勝利、北平四週與附近、以及平津鐵路一帶山林中、遊擊隊活躍如恒、由於大水故、冀中各城鎭日駐軍、多已撤退、日軍自誇洪水可逐出游擊隊、然彼等自身亦被逐走、洪水根本無助於日軍也、日軍進行已數月之晋南战事並未獲勝、而耗費甚巨、新蒙古政府、近雖成立、然綏北日駐軍、今大受威脅、日軍旣無足數軍隊、綏靖華北、且聞近數星期內、更有日軍自北平開往東三省、德蘇近訂互不侵犯條的、對於華北日本軍人、乃一特殊重大之打擊、</p>
<p>日本平民對於日本外交政策被軍人操縱失當、頗多恚言、而日本軍人於不數屋期前、猶向全國保證謂解決彼等之一切困難、盡在與當時仍盛之反共軸心、締結軍事同盟也、蘇聯近突變其政策、常人未敢遽料蘇聯將在遠東取何種政策、惟此間日本軍界相信德蘇訂約後、蘇聯將在滿邊增加軍事壓力、卽使最狂妄之日本軍閥、今因日本陷於中國泥沼兩載、資源枯竭、亦已不復信日本仍能對中蘇兩國同時作戰矣、今日軍分出大批軍隊與軍需開往滿洲前綫、對於華北之復興與綏靖、必無助益、華人問近傳可怪謠諑、謂日軍將早日退出中國、此等謠諑、當然僅係希望之思想而已、然此謠諑以及此問日僑之悲觀與憂鬰、至少係日方在華北所遇困難之徵象、若干觀察者、預料若蘇聯威脅「滿洲國」成爲事實、而該地局勢、益趨嚴重、或將使中日戰事早日得頗出人意料之結束、</p>

<h3>談判情勢無進展　日僞侵權益擴大</h3>
<p>昨又侵佔海格路某巨厦　總巡表示決意保持警權</p>
<p>美派陸戰隊來滬事已否認</p>
<p>前日外人方面盛傳、美政府已對日本提出警告、美國對於日本片面的改變上海地位之行動、表示絕對不能容忍、但美總統羅斯福國務卿赫蘭、昨日在招待記者席上、說明美國外交政策之一、為「美國反對用武力或其他方法、對遠東地位、任任何單獨變更」、若合符節、故國際問題專家之推斷、美國對日軍之進攻上海租界、在一定範圍內、美國尙不致干涉、而信任英法兩國善為處理、但如日本行動超過某種限度、妨害租界地位、則美國必當遵守其諾言、見諸行動、此係的當之論、無如際此工總局與日方甫經開始越界築路警權交涉之際、日憲兵與為警、突於昨日下午三時、又侵佔海格路四四八號大廈、並在門前佈崗駐守、其行動範圍、日趨擴大、茲將昨日所得消息、分誌於後、</p>
<p>美聯社華盛頓十三日電、美國海軍部、今日正式否認報載美國海軍陸戰隊第六隊已奉命駛赴中國消息、</p>
<h3>日僞昨侵　入海格路</h3>
<p>當此滬西極司非而路愚園路一帶、尙未恢復本月九日以前原有狀態之際、詎昨日下午又有日軍僞警六十餘人、佔據巨廈一所、可見慾堅無　、大中社記者、昨往滬西巡視、並目擊日僞方面、昨日下午侵入海格路情形、茲記詳情於後、</p>
<p>公然武裝　列隊來往</p>
<p>海格路一帶、自「八一三一前、租界方面、即積極佈防、計善鐘路·勞租育路·霞飛路之終點、各建有水泥鋼骨堡壘一座、以資鎭衛、　福開森路以西、所有各道路及小里弄、均佈有鐵絲綱、斷絕與法乘鎭之交通、因該鎭駐有大批僞警、不得不嚴加防範、時派鐵甲車前往巡邏、但僞警有時竟公然武裝列隊、在海格路上來往、因互不相犯、尙無事故發生、</p>
<p>侵佔巨厦　佈崗門首</p>
<p>海格路四百四十八號巨厦、佔地頗廣、內具林園之勝、厦為台灣人林某產業、林氏於數年前棄世、即由其眷屬居住、最近曾一度欲將該屋出賣、未有成議、兩月之前、又出租與人、開設樂園俱樂部、籌備就緒、正擬開張、經法租界當局以障碍物將其大門堵塞、致使無從交通、該俱樂部即行消滅、林氏眷屬、乃又請准法租界當局、將鐵絲綱移開一小部份、仍遷入住家、詎昨日下午三時三十分、突有日憲兵十餘人、僞警四十餘人、分乘軍卡車二輛、由極司非而路馬路橋開出、直達該巨廈門前、即敲門侵入佔據、並即派武裝僞警四名、日憲兵兩名、駐門首佈崗、至屋內主人、現仍安居於內、惟林氏眷屬、昨晨似已聞風、即將一部份傢俱什物、屬仆役開始遷出、當日僞方面佔據該屋後、法捕房政治部即派員前往調查、旋即退出、並無表示、</p>
<p>建築堡壘　有久駐意</p>
<p>至極司非而路十一號慈聯分會第卅收容所前、仍駐僞警四人、但內部日憲兵及僞警已減至十餘人、該屋內門房旁、本有平屋一間、內住難民、昨日僞警將難民驅出、撥改為廚房之用、該屋之邊門、本為難民及難童中學學生臨時出入之道、自前晚起、每至夜間、即有僞警二人駐守、注意難民學生出入、極司非而路十五號內進出者、已皆為便衣警察、人數未詳、馬路橋日憲兵西區司令部門口、本堆有沙袋、昨日起在沙袋外圍、加砌磚石水泥之堡壘、至靜安寺路一七六〇號上海商業儲蓄銀行職員宿舍、及愚園路中實新村四明別墅情形、仍如前日、惟愚園路漁光村對面錢家弄口之僞警、已減為二人、</p>
<p>外馬路警務之談判、現已開始、行將提出討論者、「市府」在極司非爾路設警局、與派警駐靜安寺捕房附近界外馬路之權力等問題、迄今為止、談判頗少進展、同時西區亦無發展、「市府警局」除星期六日午後派往界外馬路之警察外、並未繼續加派、整個問題、可望於數日內由談判而解決、</p>
<h3>談判情形　未獲進步</h3>
<p>字林報云、關於滬西界外馬路之談判、聞昨日（十二日）已在進行中、尙未獲得解決問題之辦法、惟此事仍守秘密、眾信參與商榷者、公共租界當局領事團領事、西區外國駐軍、與所謂、「上海市府」所僱武裝華警與日憲兵、如前數日然、該區局勢、表面上並無變化、又上海泰晤士報云、昨日午後、聞諸負責方面、關於滬西界</p>
<h3>英美合作　決心維護</h3>
<p>上海租界、為英·美·法·等國之商業唯一重要據點、而英國在滬權益、為數尤為鉅大、記者爰於昨晨、特向英大使館駐滬辦事處、探詢英國對租界問題所採之眞實態度、當據寇爾大使秘書戴爾定氏稱、英國當然不能放棄上海租界內之權益、吾人深信歐戰雖爆發、但英美兩國之決心合作、維持上海租界地位、實屬毫無疑義矣、</p>
<h3>總巡鮑恩　重要表示</h3>
<p>工部局警務處總巡鮑恩、負工部局警務行政最高責任、已被日方譽為「現正在努力當前困難之解除者」、前赴青島休假、其職務由史密司代理、現以三星期假期、最近返滬、於十一日赴工部局銷假辦公、對越界築路問題、前日對往訪日報記者、有重要表示、（一）聲明工部局對於越界築路警權、決意保持原有狀態、（二）對於日僞在越界築路之行動、將提付董事會討論、（三）認當此歐洲局勢惡化之際、各國應共同負責維持租界之治安、故對於上海租界之一般問題、希望英日雙方能起而合作云云、此外鮑氏否認工部局內英日人間有摩擦之事發生、工部局對日警隊並無差別待遇之事、現正考慮、以後警官補充、當儘先錄用有同等能力之日本人、「」</p>
<h3>日發言人否認　要求英法撤兵</h3>
<p>昨日（十三日）下午、西報記者在日本新聞報道席上、曾質問關於日本向英法兩國提出要求撤退駐華軍隊事、已否接到兩國之任何答覆、日大使館發言人竟稱、日本並未向英法兩國正式提出上項要求、　　昏睡的中國　業已復蘇</p>
<h3>戰事結束後　中國最獲益</h3>
<p>美經濟學家所譚</p>
<p>大陸報云、美國主要經濟學家巴勃遜、為預料一九二九年金融混亂之第一人、昨（十二日）夜乘柯立芝總統號輪過滬赴馬尼剌、在滬僅勾留兩小時、其僑滬友好設中國筵席招待、記者在席次晤之、據巴氏稱、四十年後、上海將成世界之金融中心地、巴氏對於中國前途、頗為關切、據稱中國目前之戰事、雖堪悲歏、然</p>
<h3>戰事結束</h3>
<p>時、於各人均有利、而中國民獲益尤甚、蓋彼等於戰事告終時、已自遺傳已久之昏睡病中復蘇也、戰事已有利結果、已於中國向西開發一事見之、此乃由戰事促成之現象、巴氏又稱、</p>
<p>日前歐戰</p>
<p>三閱月內不結束、則至少將延續三載、美國共和黨與民主黨將以「吾人保持美國置身戰事之外」之口號、為一九四〇年總統競運動之基礎、惟據巴氏意見、無論何黨被選、事後將迫不得已而聯合英法、加入戰爭、今美國在歐洲所維繫之經濟利益、較一九一四年為少、就另一面言、德國今較上次戰爭</p>
<p>更能持久</p>
<p>其故安在、因德蘇已有商約、能以機械易原料、控制巴羅的海之貿易、並可經中立之義大利而對外從事貿易也、巴氏復談及遠東事件宣稱、渠信中國之封閉的門戶、不致長久封閉、而不准外國貿易、日人今欲貿利、最好以外國資本為媒介、</p>
<p>印染業　提高售價</p>
<p>滬市經營染色事業者、除舊式青藍染業及綢綾染業外、其利用新式機器化學之印染工廠、統計染布廠六十餘家、染紗廠三十餘家、均屬機器梁織業範圍、每年銷費染料、數量頗鉅、且過半來自歐美、本市外商</p>
<p>營染料業</p>
<p>者、如德商之德孚洋行·英商之下內門洋碱公司所屬大英顏料公司·美商之恒信洋行·瑞士商之培亞洋行等家、國貨染料、所居成份甚少、祇天原電化廠之燒碱·祥茂江蘇藥水廠之硫酸·大中華安兩廠之硫化元·及少數來自內地之</p>
<p>植物染料</p>
<p>而已、本月初、歐洲戰幕揭展後、一般資產者流、鑒於上次歐戰業顏料商之意外獲利、紛紛儘量屯積、二三日內各洋行存棧底貨一掃而空、因此價格飛漲、大致化學原料如硫酸燒碱（即苛性鈉）漲起</p>
<p>將近一倍</p>
<p>顏料則殊有差別、數種特出貨高漲四五倍、凡貨最低亦一倍許、實為近年之創聞、本市印染業處此環境、不得不提高售價、維持血本、業經</p>
<p>議決實行</p>
<p>者、有染織業之絲光染廠組、計絲光除前加一成外、再加四成、顏色除前加二成外、再加八成、（不褪色面議）漂白所加成數、與顏色同、其他各組、亦在擬議中、</p>
<h3>海上橫被封鎖　緝私困難</h3>
<p>江海　被日方所扣全部巡艦中之一艘聯星號者、自經日方交還後、現在停泊浦江、因目前口外招待緝私工作、事實上極為困難、至日方曾允交還另一艘巡艦運星號、迄昨日止尙未實現、至其他被扣各艦、消息更為沉寂也、</p>
<h3>英領署否認處理　猶太難民投效英軍</h3>
<p>領署所組織之委員會　係調查猶人身份問題</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、英領事頃語記者稱、今晨某報所載不確、現未組織委員會、以處理德奧籍猶太難民希望投效英軍問題、刻已進行工作之委員會、乃協助英總領事署調查希望與英商有商業往來的猶太人之身份、因英政府對於許多反對納粹之德奧籍猶太移民以及捷克人、不欲以「敵人」對待之、委員會調查移民身份、目的僅在貿易、至於英軍條規、則仍禁募非英籍人民、</p>

<h3>前任菲督維斯福　第二次一碗飯宣言</h3>
<p>所得掃數捐助中國難民美各界領袖參加領導</p>
<p>美國賑濟中國難民聯合會主席維斯福上校、將於十月三十日起至十一月五日一週內、舉行第二次「一碗飯」運動、以便向美國人士捐募、賑濟中國災民、維上校宣言大意、摘錄如左、</p>
<p>一千城市聯合舉行</p>
<p>羅氏謂、本聯合會定於十月三十日起、至十一月五日止一週內、在美國一千城市、舉行第二次「一碗飯」運動、募集捐款、以便採購食物及藥品、救濟為戰事饑荒及水災受害之婦孺難民、按去年本會所舉行之第一次「一碗飯」運動、成績甚佳、故有本年第二次運動之舉行、但此次當格外努力募捐、以冀所集數目增多、良以在第三年不宣戰之戰爭狀態中、一般難民所感之需要、更為急迫、</p>
<p>醫藥衣食可怕缺乏</p>
<p>各報多注重於戰事消息之發表、而於中國千萬難民所受水深火熱之慘狀、及衣食醫藥需要之實情、未盡登戰、中國政府敎會以及救濟團體、雖已竭力設法救濟、但難民所需要之醫藥及衣食等物、仍十分缺乏、此種可怕缺乏之情形、已在中國所來之消息、述中明白指出、本會為酷愛和平友邦之災民向美國人士請命、務望熱忱慨助、以　曾受美國賑濟之國家甚多如日本地震之災黎、西班牙內戰之難民、及德國被逐之猶人、皆受其益也、</p>
<p>善意捐助甘露共享</p>
<p>此種捐款既出善意、又應接收、但本會所請命救濟中國受災之人民、亦應共享甘露、至此次「一碗飯」運動所得掃數作中國難民之用、本會辧公費不在捐款項下開支、美國實業家之領袖·無線電台·舞台·電影·以及社交之特出人材、多願參加領導此次運動、此種名單不久公佈、其餘消息、容再續告、</p>
<h3>洋米絡續軍滬　內地亦已開禁</h3>
<p>前昨兩日到洋米九千餘包內地已經日方貼開禁佈吿</p>
<p>平糶日期將發通告</p>
<p>自國米價格高漲後、虞洽卿等為維持民食起見、發起集團訂購洋米平糶、並得財部核准外滙一萬鎊、遂訂購西貢米一萬八千餘包、裝海運輸來滬、已於七日抵埠、停靠北京路外灘碼頭、業已起卸完竣、茲悉前日（十日）進口之怡和洋行和生輸、由香港運來洋米四千餘包、昨日又有太古公司之濟南運輸到滬、亦由香港運來洋米五千餘包、已分別起卸、聞剛後尙有運來、但洋米雖源源而來、惟本市米價、仍未見回落、</p>
<p>存糧激增一萬餘石</p>
<p>本市米糧、自經工部局向日方交涉疏通來源後、各地軍滬數量、日形增加、因供過於求、故米糧存棧數、亦比例增加、荳米業工會每星期舉行存糧調查一次、而於每星期一舉行之、本星期各洋棧堆棧存米總數較上星期已增加一萬餘包、</p>
<p>分區平購本旬實行</p>
<p>首批洋米一萬八千包運滬後、一萬包已由難民救濟協會分發各難民收容所、作為難民食糧、其餘八千包、決舉辦平糶、以維平民生計、經米號業工會會議決定分五區舉行、並經僱工在北河南路·卡德路等空地、蓋搭蘆蓆棚、作為平糶之所、現悉此項工程、已於昨日完竣、昨據米號公會某負責人語大光社記者云、平糶日期、已預定本星期六可實行、將發通吿、否則下星期一、可能實現、</p>
<p>洋米訂購繼續登記</p>
<p>慶恰卿等發起之民食維持會主張訂購洋米、以資壓平米價後、各工廠各團體自上月二十五日起委託浦東同鄕會大樓四樓會計師公會代辦登記手續以來、至本月十日、已達一萬包以上、發起人方面因已足訂購數量、故決先行訂購、並請各已索表格之團體、即日填報、至昨日為止、共計六十餘家、一萬一千餘包、惟因一部份團體、請求緩期截止、故該會決繼續辦理登記、至於首次訂購人會議、將俟發起人決定後、直接通知各訂戶參加、</p>
<p>來貨踴躍價趨疲軟</p>
<p>昨日米市場上市貨訂四千八百七十七包、內粳米二百二十八包、其餘均屬秈米、至於市價、秈米早市喊高一元、晏市仍回跌一元、最好者售三十五元五角、香港糯米包子售三十四元、本產糯米斛見三十三至三十四元、粳米因貨少、故價較堅挺、特號開出四十元以上、維此項價格、不能作為正式市價、因成交僅數包而已、一般情形、各項售價、將絡續回跌、來貨踴躍使然、</p>
<p>產地米糧已獲開禁</p>
<p>據大光社記者探悉、關於蘇渐皖三省之產米區域、本年秋熟晚稻新米、近將登場、預計於兩個月內、所有最晚晚稻、亦可全部出新、本年因氣候調勻、收成之佳、不遜於往年、各地米糧、自被日偽非法攔禁後、致內地農商交困、情形日趨不安、值茲新米登場在即、故各地行商、即向日偽「機關」嚴厲抗爭結果、現無錫常熟蘇州崑山等各縣、已由日方張貼開禁「佈吿」、商人可獲自出販運、惟捐稅綦重、一般販運米商、仍不堪負担耳、</p>
<h3>浦江高漲　可免溢岸</h3>
<p>如遇風雨仍宜防患</p>
<p>昨晨、因月球接近地球關係、高潮猝發、數量在十二英尺之間、幸天氣晴和、潮水未致登岸、今日午後零時間續有高潮、數量亦在十一英尺以上、故屆時低窪馬路仍難免冒水浸登路血、為行路之患也、又有十五日起浦江每日均有晨午兩潮、數量在十二英尺左右、如遇風雨、潮水頗有灌岸可能、須至二十日起、可吿平復、</p>
<h3>減低進口稅率　各關奉令實施</h3>
<p>自九月起减收三分之一有效期間戰事終了為止</p>
<p>財政部電飭總稅務司云、抗戰兩年以來、人民不避艱苦、忍受犧牲、政府深為軫念、茲為使人民生活所切需之物品、得以</p>
<p>廉價供給</p>
<p>起見、特由部准自本年九月二日起、所有進口物品、除七月一日公佈之非常時期、禁止進口物品辦法、所列各禁運物品外、其進口稅一律照現行稅率三分之一徵收、</p>
<p>有效期間</p>
<p>至戰事終了為止、除分電外，仰即遵照辦理、並佈吿週知為要、新聲社記者昨向總稅務司方面探悉、今非、</p>
<p>淪陷區域</p>
<p>各海關、均已奉命令先後實施、惟淪陷區如上海等處、因執行有窒礙之處、故恐難遵照辦理、</p>
<h3>婦人燙衣觸電</h3>
<p>寗波婦人顧田氏（三十五歲）家住海格路茂興坊上號、昨日下午二時許、用電斗燙衣、手觸電流、頓時倒地、後由家人急將其救下、已暈厥不省人事、氣若游絲、當即僱車飛送醫院救治、恐有性命之虞、</p>
<h3>煤斤來源無把握　市場頓形混亂</h3>
<p>煤球棧單現被囤戶操縱温州通航燃料不虞缺乏</p>
<p>自歐洲戰事猝發復、國外交通梗塞、運輸不無困難、滬市所需煤斤、自國煤來源斷絕後、煤商即紛向安南印度等產煤區域訂購運滬調濟、惟因成本高昂、加以外匯緊縮關係、所有煤價一年來步趨　漲、茲歐洲各國常局、皆已統制運煤出口、以致最近運滬煤塊銳减、煤業市場無貨應市、曾數度停止交易、並售價高漲、破歷來新紀錄、加以國戶居奇操縱、人心看高、秩序頗呈紊亂、</p>
<p>歐戰爆發人心堅奮</p>
<p>頃據煤　方面消息、在前週市況中、交易一度趨淸、又值外匯放鬆、成本减低、行市原有輕鬆之望、無如歐戰爆發、人心堅奮、加以來源無把握、致各項煤塊市價、扶搖直上、如海峯一·二·三號煤塊、估價達百元以上、河北篩塊九十元友右、鴻基煤存底不多、市場供求懸殊、現滬地已無貨到埠、形成有行無市、暗盤猖獗、頭號小子更行缺乏、惟煤業商人乘機活躍、囤積居奇、靜待善價出售、據悉目前滬市煤貨、約在四五十萬噸之多、烟煤多數、各業工廠遭受煤塊價格騰漲影饗、損失綦鉅、頗為焦慮</p>
<p>煤球漲價由於操縱</p>
<p>日內市上煤球售價、日有增漲、每担竟有售至四元以上者、不特市面為之紊亂、仰且有碍平民生計、煤球業同業公會於九月三日議定市價、批發每公噸六十七元、門市零售每担三元七角、旬日以來、並未變更、不料最近市上竟發生暗盤、每噸開價八十元、各煤炭店零售價格不一、紛亂異常、考其原因、因以前各廠出售定貨棧單、為數過多、此項棧單多數落在投機者手中、囤積居奇、不肯出貨、致釀成市上缺貨之恐慌、公會為謀救濟計、特召集各廠來會集議、組織評價委員會、擬具已發棧單解決辦法、期將市價仰平、减輕市民负担、且據調查所得、歐戰雖已發動、而外煤來源、並未阻滞、如通成公司之古拔屑、漢成洋行之新鴻屑、義泰興·大隆興·之鴻幕屑、均有大批到滬、原料即充、廠方出品亦可增加、投機者即無從操縱、市價不平而自平、</p>
<p>神愛輪裝木炭來滬</p>
<p>本市燃料木炭來源、向賴溫州等地供給、溯自滬甌斷航以後、來源斷絕、致價格逐步飛漲、惟開溫炭　批價格、每担僅售三元六角零、而輾轉入於囤戶之手、市間價格竟高至每担十元左右市民深感痛苦、茲悉滬溫試航成功、神愛輪首批裝有木炭六千餘担、約本月十五六日可以抵滬、其餘各輪亦將絡續運申、總計五萬餘担、自是則本埠燃料問題得以解决矣、</p>
<h3>遊擊區改製洋貨　禁運內地</h3>
<p>禁運前付郵包裹經查明者准進口</p>
<p>禁運某種洋貨進口轉口辦法、茲經財政部令規定辦法兩項如下、（一）凡在游擊區內用禁運洋貨為原料所製成之貨物、亦在禁運之列、（二）凡郵包裝寄禁運洋貨或游擊區內用禁運洋貨為原材料所製成之貨物、如經海關查明、係於進口口岸實施禁運以前、即已在國外或游擊區內寄出者、應即准予進口、</p>
<h3>滬甬客貨壅塞　業以添輸裝運</h3>
<p>怡龍太古各輸恢復滬閩航綫甌江口通航後行駛尙稱順利</p>
<p>滬甬棧貨運繁盛、均因船期久遠所造成、假使照載前之船期、隔日一班、決無如許之貨往返、乘客亦無如是之擁擠、故客貨之多、皆為日久堆積所致、現在船期之長、等於航行國外、禮和洋行謀福輸、係上月九日自甬返滬、十六日復駛鎭海、前聞昨日可返滬、至晚尙未見進口、公司方面、亦無確切消息、該輸照土次返滬日期計算、已超過一月餘、照開船日期計算、亦已二十九天、聞今日尙不能到滬、</p>
<p>滬甬外輸增至九艘</p>
<p>新加入航行之新安納輸、今晨首次公司恩德輸、改今日下午四時出口、海達輸亦加入滬甬綫、昨日將　米卸淸後、暫駛楊樹浦江面停泊、定十五日開回北京路外灘碼頭、裝載甬貨、約十六或十七日開往鎭海口、現行駛滬甬外輸已增至九艘、</p>
<p>英商恢復滬閩航綫</p>
<p>上海福州之航綫停航已久、今英商怡龍公司已派定神華輸、准今晨由滬裝貨搭客直放福州、決停泊閩江口外之馬尾、並擬派輸恢復與化泉州綫、聞英商太古公司亦將派輸行駛滬閩航綫、</p>
<p>派輸行駛上海溫州</p>
<p>上海溫州航綫經試航成功後、泰昌洋行代理之英商新祥泰輸、於十日由滬直放溫州、昨晨已接電吿、已於昨晨九時安抵溫州碼頭、又英商怡龍公司之神福输、已於昨日由滬裝貨直放溫州、神愛輸現泊溫裝貨、</p>
<h3>德僑尙紛遷　公共租界</h3>
<p>德國利克茂輸公司上海分公司、設法租界愛多亞路九號、現聞因接受友誼之勸吿、將於今日（十四）遷至公共租界四用路六二〇號、該公司輪隻、於</p>
<p>歐戰爆發</p>
<p>前、經常開駛於德國遠東間、自戰爭爆發、多數船隻即停泊漢堡港內、惟一艘避於日本、一艘猶在吳淞、又最近數日內、法租界之法國小商店以及</p>
<p>德國僑民</p>
<p>遷入公共租界者、甚形擁擠、致公共和界之旅館公寓、為之客滿、惟大商行之遷居者、以利克茂為首、上海納粹人民救濟會與德國婦女協會、頃合</p>
<p>組問訊處</p>
<p>設於南京路二百二十六號、俾代就地遷居之德僑、與外埠避難來滬之德僑、尋見房屋、以及互通信息、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>字義與作文</h3>
<p>— 消人</p>
<p>直到現在，還有一些復古家在替靑年發愁，說寫口語體比寫文言更難，因為口語體中許多字義都是從文言來的，正像法文的從拉丁文轉化而來的一樣，所以要眞正理解了文言，寫口語體纔不會亂來。——這種理論的實踐便是國文敎員呌學生讀古文，做古文。</p>
<p>其實這種理論還是祖述章太炎先生的。不過太炎先生底主張却更加徹底，他說：現在的口語大部分都是古語，現在的字大部分都是古字，要不通「小學」去寫白話，一定會錯得一場糊塗。現在的復古家不過變通得稍微折衷了一點而已。</p>
<p>然而無論怎樣說，這種理論總是可笑的。假使說爲了硏究語言文字而去「理解」古文，甚至去通「小學」，那是沒有間題的；但復古家却偏要說是爲了應用。這樣一來，却就有了問題了。</p>
<p>每一代底語言是由上代底語言轉化而來，這是事實，沒有人能够吾認。但所以要轉化，却就因爲有這種需要。自然也還有些字義是和上代一樣的，但那些字義所以能遺留下來，却就因爲是現代人還可以懂的緣故。只要懂，自然就能用，要費神去追尋那些根源，却實在未免是多事。因爲一追尋之下，勢必越走越遠。那最徹底的結果是：的定成俗的借字都不能用，一動筆就先要想每個字本來的字義是甚麼，勢必弄得戰戰兢兢，現代的文章寫不成了。</p>
<p>寫文章只有一個目的：爲的把自己底思想傳達給現代人看。而看文章也只是看你底思想，冉附帶看你把思想到底傳達出來了沒有。作者旣不爲字義而作文，讀者也不爲字義而讀文。所以，就是「理解」了所有文言中的字義，和寫現代的文章是不相干的。甚至完全　通了」了某字是「象形」，某字是「會意」，某字是「諧聲」，和寫現代的文章也是不相干的。要靑年先學通了文言，甚至背熟了「說文解字」，再來動手寫現代的文章，這對於古文家，小學家，自然是很好，大家有飯吃了，但對於靑年本身却會被騙得沒有出頭的日子。</p>
<p>把中國古文比拉丁文，實際也比得並不對。但就是拉丁文罷，在法國和其他同語系的各國，却也並不是一般人都懂得的，學校裏的拉丁文也只是選修科，而且你倘是問問法國人或另外的那一國人，他們總是說拉丁文難，決不說現代他們底國文比拉丁文更難。法文也有古文的，那到可以比作中國底古文，但那種文字却是早已成了古董，作品也都被譯成現代的法文了。</p>
<p>歸根結蒂，我們這方塊字要是還存在一天，我們用的始終是這約定成俗的借字，而且一別字」還要多起來的，——那就是所謂轉化，距離原來的字義將要一天一天地更遠。復古家雖然可以暫可壓制靑年，但心機到頭還是枉費。</p>
<p>不過我並不是反對有人去理解古文和通「小學」，我只是說那是專家底事，而不是每個要能寫國文的靑年底事。專家儘可以「理解」得更深，「通」得更深，能够背寫鐘鼎文和甲骨文，但他絕對沒有權要別個都去學他。而且就是專家罷，倘是要發表他硏究的心得，也還非用現代文寫出來不可，太炎先生一生用古字寫文章，但他終於無法全篇都古，他還是在用借字。只有錢玄同先生會經用「說文」字抄了太炎底「小學答問」，但讀者怕也只是他本人和太炎。</p>
<p>這說的其實都是常識。不過使我終於這樣不避淺薄地來說一說的，就因爲復古家底理論未免太出了常識了。</p>
<h3>比利時的「馬奇諾」陣線</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>近年來歐洲各國備戰不遺餘力，且在邊陲修築防綫。比利時雖宣布今後對於歐洲的戰事永守中立，但依然在邊陲築成防錢，這防綫築在德國西格菲利陣綫對面，南接法國的馬奇諾陣綫，北運荷蘭的堡壘。</p>
<p>它的組織可分爲兩段：（一）水道線（在北面）和（二）堡壘線（在南面）。</p>
<p>水道線的功用在於利用地土的特殊情形隨時能用水把該地區淹沒，來有效的阻止敵軍深入。這線計自里愛巨（Liege）起至荷蘭邊陲爲止，由荷比二國間的賣士（Meuse）河和幾條運河—叙利亞拿（Jueian）運河，亞爾培（Aebert）運河和一條所謂接合河所合成。其中工程最大的是亞爾培河：在一九三三年的五月比王亞爾培開始開鑿這河的第一段，自里愛巨至哈西爾特（Hasselt）。二年後此王萊屋拋特（Leopold）和王后矮司屈特（Astrid）開鑿第二段自盎凡爾斯（Anvers）至歇倫薩爾斯（Hereuthals）。第三段是由現任比王所發起，數月前在英法艦隊衛護下鑿成。這河目里愛巨至盎凡爾斯計長一百二十二公里，備有水閘六個。在必要時可開放水閘重演依塞（Yser）河事蹟。（按在一九一四年時，依塞河的水閘管理員曾開放大量河水以阻止德軍前進。）</p>
<p>堡壘線差不多與法國馬奇諾陣錢同時具集。但因保守秘密的緣故，至今還有很多人沒有知道這堅固的陣線。</p>
<p>建築這堡壘線的計劃是：經過好些激烈的論爭才決定的有人主張依照從前有效地抵抗坦克車的方略，建築一種很深的水泥塹壕網；但其他人員認爲如此的工事在變化多端的現在戰術中是不足防禦的，他們極力擁護法國所採用的計劃：就是建築一種運續的工事，配備着地下避彈室和最新式武器。結果他們運用了上面二種計劃的混合方式，又雜以上次大戰前德國在美的（Metz）建築花葉形陣線（grands　festons）所用的防禦方法。</p>
<p>從龍格回（Longwy）到里愛巨，這一帶起伏不平的森林高原本來是一條可靠的天然障礙線，所以只須建築相當工事以截斷橋樑要隘，裝設暗砲臺以控制道路和多置地雷，在防禦上已足够了。現在里愛巨古舊的城堡已化爲新式，但眞正比利時的馬奇諾陣線在城東仲延十五里後就接合在荷國邊陸處的賣士河了。至於能被坦克車攻擊的地帶早已備有大批障礙物，最前的是地雷，地雷後面有柵欄，後面佈置長列的廣闊的鐵絲網。此外還有許多坦克車陷穽散播在各處。以上種種都設置在自動器和裝甲砲射程之內。在陸地深處鑿有無數的隧道以連絡裝置射擊器的洞穴，空氣管及出口。</p>
<p>地下設備有通風燒熱發光的電氣裝置，還有升降機，軍器室，軍需庫，食糧貯藏室，臥室，廚房，救護室等。有幾處隧道甚至距地面達一百公尺（節譯自巴黎Illustration）</p>
<h3>窗邊偶拾</h3>
<p>— 徐野</p>
<p>僑頭</p>
<p>現在，我懷念着故鄉的橋頭了。</p>
<p>看過一陣秋雁掠過長空，天野的閒雲織成一片悅目的圖畫，在流水不斷地深深作響的小溪裏，傳來了熟識的船夫搖櫓的聲音。</p>
<p>這裏的一座橋，在它的下面又攢出來幾隻趕上早市的舟子。</p>
<p>『哼——喲！』</p>
<p>靜默的溪畔中盪起了攪動的回聲。</p>
<p>帶着幽穆而淸致的橋頭，我喜歡單自地走上那裏去望望遼闊的雲和天。</p>
<p>「早！今天來得這樣早？』</p>
<p>爲着我常去橋頭的，於是，每天在溪畔撈着水萍的那個老年的村人慣是這樣笑着問我</p>
<p>『你呢？生意好吧！』</p>
<p>『嗯！這年頭——那有怎樣好過。』</p>
<p>聽到深沉的歎息，水面砰的一聲，恍惚溪裏的魚躍到岸上來。</p>
<p>從此，老人的話便打斷了</p>
<p>記得有一個悠長的日子，我會經去過城裏敎書，常放假日回來的時候，照例老是走到橋頭去，依然看到坐在溪畔的老人，他默然地注視那跟流水角遂着的浮萍。</p>
<p>「好久不見了！早呀。』</p>
<p>這成爲他的口語，『早呀』他總說出嘴巴來，雖然見到他的時間不是早晨而在黃昏。</p>
<p>深夜，我悄悄地拖着影子再去橋頭了，溪畔的老人也不見了，我望着秋天的夜空，遙遠地聽着村鼓，偶爾在蘆葦的深處撲到驚心的尖銳的音饗。</p>
<p>『是雁啼嗎？』自己似乎在感動着。</p>
<p>月亮圓圓的，潔白的光芒瀉射着酣睡了村落，溪畔也沒有半點騷動，僅有嗚蟲的呌囂配起水聲合奏着夜的行進曲。輕風吹過對岸的柳樹，我的頭髮也像柳絮般的　着，飄着。月的影漸漸地移倒水裏，皎潔的反光刺進我的眼，我的面部。細心瞧去它更像一個銀盤，一串明珠，有時跟天上的沒有兩樣，然而，風拂動了水的沉靜，溪中的月也幻成一綫波紋似的光圈，再變幻着百點，千點，分散在水面上。</p>
<p>『吱——』突來的顗聲，樹葉也打動了。</p>
<p>深深地，我搔起頭髮想着</p>
<p>現在，我久不見故鄕，久不見那座橋頭和撈萍的老人，秋夜的雁聲也聽不到了。可是，不管隔別了三年或五戰，憑我的懷念，遠遠地盼望着可愛的橋頭的安然無恙。</p>
<p>料想它如今會健壯的，倔强的存在，站立在那溪畔。</p>
<p>詩篇</p>
<p>是夜來的街頭的三弦，引起我一宵的失眠。</p>
<p>琴聲是凄切的，鬰抑的，像急雨，像流水，急驟和遲慢的音律合爲一段零亂的雜奏，我愛聽，但，不久我終於厭惡它了。</p>
<p>更深音樂增添夜闌的寥寂</p>
<p>我不能甜快地入睡，側耳地，靜聽拉琴者的足音，在他蹣跚的步伐裏，天涯的雲烟給他的感覺更加深重地，深重地</p>
<p>黑暗走進窗檑，我把電燈扭亮了，索性的攤開了一張稿紙，想執筆寫着一篇詩。</p>
<p>迷濛的天際範着迷濛的夜色，都會在動亂着；展開那一方的有罪惡與無恥，暴露這一方的有呌號與呻吟……</p>
<p>望着淡黃色的燈光，這就是光明的啟示吧！</p>
<p>蘸好了墨水，我要寫街頭的拉琴者，他是我美麗的句子，而且，一個人流浪的命運更需要我去記起的。</p>
<p>寫吧！仲首瞧回拉琴者的背影，他却抱着三弦涕泣了。</p>
<p>哭着甚麽呢？也許有了動人的故事。</p>
<p>墨水已經乾了，我第二次用筆尖向水瓶裏再蘸着，這一刻我寫的，不，我怎樣去寫呢</p>
<p>前樓的一對年靑男女剛是歸來，嗤嗤的笑聲混爲一片難聽的氣氛，收音機在唱着：望穿秋水，不見伊人……</p>
<p>俚俗的歌曲使我扔下了筆桿，心頭的憎恨將要我予以鄙惡的吼喊，忿嚷。</p>
<p>結果是失眠，一宵的失眠，擺着案上的依港有一張空白的紙，一頁無字的詩篇。</p>

<h3>新春秋戲劇學校的現在與將來</h3>
<p>— 李同愈</p>
<p>「藝術有時間性麽？」這一個問題已被許多人熱烈地論爭過。但無論藝術之有無時間性，一種藝術在某一時代中能够存在而被大衆擁護時，至少這種藝術已具有了歷史上的價値，具有了技術上的優點，値得被人欣賞而硏究。</p>
<p>以戲劇而論，三十年前便有了新劇與京戲的對立，那時新劇不幸是失敗了，而京戲則依然抓住了最多數的觀衆。近十年中話劇又抬頭起來了，戰前的中旅，實騐及業餘話劇社，在上海一地都發揮了極大的光芒，而擁有極多的觀衆。允其是中旅，從北京到上海，到漢口，到廣東，以及無數大小城市，獲得了最大效果，使一般人對話劇有了新的印象。而話劇在最近若干年中就打定了堅固的基礎。</p>
<p>可是，話劇之抬頭就可以使京戲衰亡麼？無疑地，京戲存在如此長久，已沒有人能吾定它的歷史底價値。新的藝術理論以爲藝術之存在於某一時代必需配合某一時代的政治經濟社會諸動向，換一句話說，藝術的直接效果是促進政治社會經濟的。可是產生這種理論的蘇俄本國，不僅是盡了最大力量歡迎過梅畹華，而且到革命成功社會制度改變的今日，已經重新印行了莎士比亞和托爾斯泰的全集，他們在接受着遺產呢。</p>
<p>現在要說到本題。新春秋戲劇學校是開始以訓練京戲學生爲目的的，但後來又招考了話尷的學生。到正式上課的今日，便成爲一面敎授京戲一面排練話劇的學校。據負責的校長所說，是要鎔新舊藝術於一爐，取其精華，發揚光大。這抱負的偉大原是値得敬佩的。但要由京戲與話劇而合成一種新歌劇，原是非常費力的工作。校畏潘王吉女士是京劇票界的名家，所請的敎授却多數是話劇界的前輩先生，這努力在將來應該有良好的結果。自然，無論京戲與話劇，藝術理論的根據則並無二致，尤其是「鎔新舊戲劇於「爐」的新春秋學校，應該特別注重於藝術令質這一點，使學員除了懂得表演和歌唱之外，更明瞭新舊劇的藝術的價値。事實上，成爲一個非常的藝人是必不可忽略藝術理論的重要性的。</p>
<p>新春秋學校由潘王古校長私人出資創辦，對於學員的優待條件超過以前一切戲劇學校的先例。在戲劇人材寥落的今日，這一枝生力軍的造就將是戲劇界値得注意的一件大事。</p>
<h3>來滬後之章遏雲</h3>
<p>— 芸芸</p>
<p>章遏雲已於上星期由津抵滬，昨與記者相見，詢以天津遭遇水巡之消息，據稱大水之來戲已演畢，伊亦安返家中，未有避在屋頂之事，且中國大戲院二樓並米浸水，決小致避上屋頂，滬上所傳消息，想係誤傳無疑。</p>
<p>章遏雲此次來滬仍居褚家橋金老公館，不日即將在黃金出演，其配角問題，不易解決，因目下黃金無鬚生，缺小生，有許多戲不能唱，小生可山桐珊反串，鬚生問題解決後即可登臺。伊近患目疾，據說去年年底來滬時亦曾患過，經醫治後已見效，數日後即可恢復云。</p>
<h3>章遏雲之戲裝</h3>
<p>新片介紹</p>
<h3>新四千金</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“Danghters　Courgeous”</p>
<p>「新四千金」的故事是非常動人的：一個離家出走，在外流浪了二十年的丈夫，當他重復回到溫暖的家庭來時，他的四倘女兒已經長大成人了。但是他的妻子就在這時候將和一個熱戀着她十二年的富商結婚。這悲劇的展開是並不止於單純的戀愛，由於這位流浪人的歸來，將破壞整個家庭的幸福，同時也將損害了四個女兒未來的前途。於是這位離家二十年的丈夫，終於犧牲自己，在他妻子結婚的那天，重行踏上征途，繼續他的流浪生涯。</p>
<p>演這位離家二十年的丈夫的是克勞特倫斯，演妻子的是費本德（總沒有忘記她就是「處女的苦悶」的母親），他們在情感與理智衝突下的矛盾心理，却演得非常深刻動人，允其是克勞特倫斯在回家時，及和妻子話別時的幾個「特寫」，都能運用眼睛和嘴角的表情，狀出他的內心的苦痛。</p>
<p>導演者在這兩塲戲（回家，離家）中，利用對照的手法，加强悲劇的氣氛。譬如：四個女兒替她們的新父親薙鬚子，合家欣然宴餐時，流浪人突然歸家。餐後，一面談笑甚歡，一面獨坐一隅；一面同到跳舞塲去，一面頹然倒要在椅上。離家時，同樣一面寫着合家的欣喜之狀，而克勞特倫斯悄然出走，在婚禮中，遠遠的汽笛呌着。同時，導演者更能充份地寫出各個人的心理狀態。</p>
<p>不過，整個戲的發展顯得不够十分湊緊，因爲他同時要寫四姊妹的戀愛，並要加强潘茜麗拉蘭和的翰迦飛爾之間的關係的緣故。大體上說來，「新四千金」是一個好戲。</p>
<p>四姊妹的戲在這里祇是陪襯，都沒有特出的成績。的翰迦飛爾戲雖少，倒很穩重。</p>

<h3>Attempt to Capture Warsaw Ends in Failure: German Forces Change Strategy, Plan New Offensive; Polish Army Recovers Important Town of Lodz, Establishes New Defensive Positions; Rain Season Arrives Quickly, Rendering German Mechanized Units Ineffective</h3>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources from Poland, Polish forces have retaken the vital town of Lodz, 82 miles southwest of Warsaw. Polish forces in Poznan and Pomorze, who were in danger of being cut off, have now re-established contact with the main Polish forces southwest of Warsaw. (Reuters, Central Europe, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The resistance of the Polish forces along the 300-mile front has visibly strengthened. They have not only established new defensive positions along the San River, Bug River, and Narew River, but are also determined to prevent further German advances. Having been stalled, the Germans are now attempting to encircle the Polish forces on the Bug River from both the north and south. (Associated Press, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) Public attention on the Eastern Front is now focused on the German assault on Przemysl, a key city in Silesia. It is widely believed that this move aims to sever Poland's transportation links with its neutral southern neighbors. The starting point of the German northern offensive is East Prussia, with the objective of seizing the important railway junction of Bialystok. The significance of German air superiority is being widely discussed. According to Polish estimates, the Germans are using a total of 5,000 aircraft, 3,000 of which are bombers. The recent loss of its southwestern industrial region has created a serious problem for Poland regarding the supply of munitions. Meanwhile, observers here claim that Germany seems to realize that clearing western Poland is no easy task, as brave Polish soldiers are actively operating west of Warsaw. The bravery of these Polish troops has earned them the reputation of a "daredevil squad." (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) Significant developments have occurred in the Polish war over the past three days, leading to notable changes in key areas within Poland. According to an official Warsaw radio broadcast today, recent developments include the Polish forces' escape from the Pomorze region (also known as Polish Pomerania or the Corridor) and the retreat of Polish forces from the agricultural province of Poznan in western Poland. Another Polish source reports that the German command has abandoned its intention to seize Warsaw by force and has ordered its mechanized units to halt their advance towards the capital. Instead, the Germans have launched a new offensive on both flanks of the Polish lines. However, Polish officials claim that the Germans are currently being contained and have made no progress. Another Polish source claims that Lodz, an industrial town 82 miles southwest of Warsaw captured by the Germans on Sunday, has been retaken. Polish sources believe that the German decision to temporarily abandon the attempt to seize Warsaw is due to the concentration of the large Polish force that withdrew from the "Poznan pocket" between Lodz and the Vistula River. It is reported that the Polish forces in Pomorze escaped by breaking through the German lines connecting mainland Germany and East Prussia. This is a significant victory, as the only way out was through the German forces in front. It is reported that these Polish troops from the Corridor, after breaking through the German lines, have made contact with the main Polish forces and are now fighting alongside them. However, the outcome of the battle is not yet known. It is reported that the Polish forces in Poznan province withdrew after repeated fierce battles with the German forces blocking their eastward retreat. The retreat was orderly, and they have not only made contact with their forces southeast of Warsaw but have also reached Lodz. According to Polish official reports, the Warsaw garrison has repeatedly launched successful attacks against the German forces attempting to capture the capital. German forces on other fronts are currently being contained and are unable to make further progress. The German air force, having suffered heavy losses, has visibly reduced its activity.

<p>(London) Military observers today are paying close attention to the noticeable slowing of the German advance within Poland, attributing it to the dangers posed by Germany's long supply lines. It is estimated that the Germans are advancing an average of 20 miles per day, which makes supply difficult. This rate, even for mechanized units, is considered too high, resulting in troop fatigue, especially for tanks and heavily armored units, which consume the most fuel. This has given the Polish forces an opportunity to dig in and hold their ground, potentially leading to a temporary stalemate. However, observers caution against optimism. The position of the Polish forces in the so-called "Poznan pocket," 120 miles long west of Warsaw and 50 miles wide north to south, surrounded by German forces on both sides, is precarious. Two railways, previously unnoticed in German strategy—the Konigsberg-Bialystok line in the north and the Krakow-Lemberg line in the south—are now attracting attention. These two lines greatly assist the Germans in developing flanking attacks on the Polish new defensive positions between the Vistula and Bug rivers. However, the weather from now on will be greatly beneficial to the Polish forces. According to the Daily Mail, a three-month drought in Poland suddenly ended yesterday with heavy rain, causing significant difficulties for German heavy mechanized units. The Polish Embassy in London could not confirm this report but stated that rain often falls at this time of year. Since the time of Napoleon, Poland has been known for its muddy terrain.

<h3>Civilians and Soldiers Defend Warsaw</h3>
<p>A dispatch from the Lithuanian capital in the Swiss Basel Daily News describes the defense of Warsaw, stating that people of Warsaw, regardless of age or gender, are all assisting in building obstacles with old trams, trains, and broken tiles from air raids to protect the capital. A dispatch from Berlin in the same newspaper states that the German side expects heavy losses in the fighting around Warsaw, as Polish forces are operating in small units, constantly disrupting German rear areas. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Heavy German Losses</h3>
<p>Schaffhausen, Switzerland According to reliable sources, German losses within Poland are far greater than those announced in official reports, and the number of dead and wounded is far higher than anticipated. As a result, there is a shortage of doctors and nurses, and many wounded soldiers have died due to lack of timely treatment. Hospitals and small schools in Vienna are now filled with wounded soldiers. Furthermore, the number of Polish soldiers captured by the Germans is small, indicating that Polish resistance is extremely fierce, with soldiers preferring death to surrender. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Near Radom, in the German rear A German military expert recently estimated that the total number of German casualties since the outbreak of the war is between 12,000 and 15,000, with the heaviest losses occurring in the past two days, as the Germans advanced towards Radom, the San River, and the Bug River, where fierce battles were fought. According to German official statistics, there were also fierce battles on the front lines during the first week of the initial German-Polish contact, so there must have been significant losses in the military formations near Radom and the San River. (Associated Press Special Correspondent, 13th)</p>
<p>Danzig A German tank officer, speaking to a Berlin correspondent of the Politische Zeitung, estimated that German deaths and injuries had reached 15,000, with Polish deaths and injuries at least ten times that number. He also stated that because the Germans could not hold prisoners, they had to shoot all Polish soldiers captured during the war. The Polish people fought bravely, and Germany would have great difficulty conquering Poland. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Goering Inspects the Front Lines</h3>
<p>(Berlin) General Goering visited Führer Hitler at the Supreme Command yesterday and gave a two-hour report on the activities of the German Air Force in Poland and the plans he had adopted as chairman of the Defense Cabinet Council. He then flew by plane to an area somewhere between Warsaw and the Carpathian Mountains to inspect the air force units fighting in the vicinity. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Indiscriminate Air Raids</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German Air Force continued to bomb roads, bridges, and railways east of the Vistula River. Three sections of trains at the Krystynopol train station were hit and caught fire. The aircraft factory in Biala Podlaska was also hit and burned. (Havas News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Officials here announced this evening that German air force units participated in the fighting near Kutno today, greatly assisting the advance of the army. The railways from Sambor to Lviv, Stryj to Lviv, Krasnik to Lublin, and Warsaw to Bialystok have been bombed and cut. Polish troops and vehicles on the highways from Warsaw to the east and northeast have been attacked. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Germany's War Against Poland Cannot Be a Swift Victory: Threatens to Bomb Unfortified Cities; Plans to Increase Troop Strength on Both Eastern and Western Fronts</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to an announcement issued today by the highest German military authorities, Germany will spare no possible means to destroy Polish resistance. This means bombing unfortified cities to force Poland to submit. According to a message from the Führer's headquarters, local officials and officers in Poland are now ordering civilians in all towns and villages to resist the German forces. At the beginning of the campaign, the German side stated that it did not intend to bomb unfortified towns, but if these towns turn into battlefields, that would be another matter. This responsibility should be borne by the Polish government and its military leaders. It was also stated that German mechanized units today broke through Polish lines east of Warsaw and advanced south, hoping to cut off the retreat of Polish forces defending Warsaw. Polish forces advancing in Galicia are continuing to attack Polish forces. Nowy Sacz and Krakow have been occupied by the Germans, and the German vanguard has reached Lwow. (Associated Press, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to military experts here, as the war develops, Germany really needs to increase its troop strength on both the Eastern and Western Fronts. It is rumored that Hitler has decided to recall another 2.25 million men, one million of whom will be sent to the Western Front as reinforcements, and another one million to Poland, in order to destroy Polish resistance as soon as possible. However, as of now, Germany has not yet conscripted manpower from Austria and Czechoslovakia. Judging from the German soldiers who have been captured, the ages vary greatly, indicating that its reserves, regular army, and youth army have all been mobilized. (Associated Press, 13th)</p>
<h3>German War Reports Exaggerate Victory</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German High Command issued a statement today stating that the northern and southern wings of the German forces on the Eastern Front continued to pursue the enemy yesterday. Sambor and Jaworow were occupied. The Polish forces trapped south of Radom have been defeated. Five Polish divisions and two cavalry divisions besieged near Grodno attempted to break out but were unsuccessful. The German forces are concentrating their attacks. German forces have broken through the highways east and southeast of Warsaw and crossed the road from Warsaw to Siedlce, 40 kilometers north of Brest-Litovsk. The Polish 18th Division retreated south from Lwow, moving slowly, and is now fighting the German forces north of the Bug River. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a war report stating: (1) After the central Polish forces were surrounded by our forces south of Radom, their resistance was destroyed. We captured many prisoners in this battle and seized a large number of spoils. (2) Our southern forces are advancing victoriously towards Rambervillers. (3) Our southeastern forces have occupied Sambor and reached the south bank of the Dniester River, while motorized units have captured Krakowiec. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Electricity-Controlled Machine Guns: New Weapons Used by German Forces on the Western Front</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tokyo Electric, "Daily News" Paris report, according to French officials, the German forces on the Western Front are now using electricity "remote control" machine guns to defend against the French advance. Dr. Yamauchi, professor of mechanical engineering at Tokyo Imperial University, said that he had heard of this weapon, which had been tested abroad, but had not heard of it being used in the military. This machine gun is thought to be controlled by a generator from a distance. However, it is questionable whether it can be used to attack enemy forces. The remote control method has also been designed for use in anti-aircraft guns. (13th Electric)</p>
<h3>Middle-Aged and Elderly German Men Forced Onto the Battlefield: Experienced in Two Major Wars; More Young People Remain Behind</h3>
<p>Amsterdam According to a Berlin dispatch in a Dutch newspaper, German men aged 47 and 48 have now been conscripted. Most of these men participated in the World War more than 20 years ago. The German government does not want to conscript young men who are very useful in industry, so as not to disrupt the domestic economy. Moreover, since many young men have not received military training, they feel that it is better to conscript middle-aged men. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>London Evacuates Government Agencies; Cabinet Members Remain in Capital to Work; Paris Zoo Relocates</h3>
<p>(London) According to official sources, some government agencies that can operate normally without being located in the capital and without impairing their efficiency will now be moved from London to other places. It is reported that about 7,000 to 8,000 people will move out of London with them. As for the government itself, it will remain in London. All matters directly related to wartime affairs will not be relocated. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Beijing The Paris Zoo has also followed London's example and evacuated completely. The most valuable animals have been transported to various provinces, and various poisonous snakes and less important animals have been slaughtered. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that a general political department will be established soon. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Heavy Artillery Fire on Western Front; British Forces Join Combat; French Forces Advance on Siegfried Line; Fierce German Counterattacks Repelled</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to French military reports released here, British forces fought for the first time on the Western Front lines today. A large contingent of well-equipped British troops are now participating in the war. All French newspapers tonight published news of the British troops being baptized by fire in prominent positions. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 19 stating, "Yesterday, both air forces were very active, and the enemy artillery bombarded throughout the night." (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to sources here, since the French forces occupied the Forêt de la Warndt, the momentum of their advance has become more obvious. Saarbrucken is now under real threat. According to the French General Headquarters, French forces are currently continuing to advance between the Rhine and Moselle rivers, using many tanks. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) According to qualified sources here, this time the British forces were transported to France in such a way that the German side did not detect it at all, just as in 1914. However, in this era of wireless communication and long-range aerial photography, the difficulty of keeping secrets is far greater than during the last troop transport. Military observers here all believe that today's British Expeditionary Force, from the perspective of its size and equipment, is more important than the forces sent to France at the beginning of the last war. The new expeditionary force has not yet participated in combat. According to military observers, Germany originally planned to use the Netherlands and Belgium to protect its flanks and hold onto the defensive works between Luxembourg and Switzerland, waiting at leisure. But this scheme has been disrupted by French strategy. In the first week, French strategy forced the German forces to be completely exposed, so the French forces advanced safely. French Commander-in-Chief General Gamelin has used this to create a kind of formation that is at the pinnacle of heavy defense, and it has long been heard that this defense can be used to open up various lines of concrete attack. All observers also believe that in order to attack Poland, the German forces have transferred the defending troops from the Siegfried Line to the east, so they may feel that it is difficult to hold onto their old positions in the future. The driving force of the current war is in the hands of the French. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) At a time when the Polish forces are putting up a tenacious resistance to the German forces, the French forces have posed a great threat to the German forces, having broken into the "no man's land" between the Maginot Line and the Siegfried Line. The French front line has advanced from the Moselle River to the Rhine River, especially in the three areas of the Moselle-Saar front and the Vosges Mountains, where the French forces have made great progress. In the Vosges Mountains, the French front line has crossed the German border and directly approached the Siegfried Line. Yesterday was the 25th anniversary of the Battle of the Marne, and the French forces continued to carry forward the spirit of Marshal Foch, inflicting heavy blows on the German counterattacks. After the German forces failed to attack the triangular positions of the Maginot Line between the Saar and Moselle rivers, their military strength has been greatly weakened. The center of gravity of the war on the Western Front has shifted to between the Moselle and Saar rivers. A war report released here yesterday stated that "there is constant contact between Saarbrucken and Blieskastel over twelve miles. Although the German counterattacks were fierce, the French forces have always maintained a superior position. The German forces launched an attack with three of their most elite divisions and achieved great success." (Associated Press, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The famous reporter Maurice recently continued to comment on the situation of the war between France and Germany in the Le Petit Parisien, briefly stating, "Our army's offensive against the city of Saarbrucken is becoming increasingly concrete. This place is an important center of German industry and is now under serious threat. Residents are being evacuated. In addition, the German public bulletin has acknowledged that our army's artillery has bombarded the Saarbrucken airfield. Our army's artillery has continuously bombarded the suburbs of the city and the area northwest of the airfield in the past 24 hours. It is expected that the time when the German forces withdraw from the city and defend the northern positions is not far away." (Havas, 13th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The High Cost of Living in Shanghai</h3>
<p>In recent days, the cost of living in Shanghai has been rapidly increasing again. This time, the price increases are not limited to imported goods from overseas, nor are they limited to daily necessities such as rice, oil, firewood, and coal; even various public utilities are increasing their prices. Furthermore, some stores in the market are either limiting the quantity of certain goods sold or even temporarily suspending the sale of certain commodities. The development of this situation naturally has a significant impact on the residents of Shanghai. Since the destruction of the "August 13th" battle, various industries and businesses in Shanghai have not returned to normal prosperity; most of the residents have not regained their original productive capacity. Whether the society can bear this continuous economic pressure is a major concern for the public.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of prices are usually determined by the supply and demand of commodities; changes in the domestic currency value can also have a considerable impact. This is a natural economic phenomenon. In general, people believe that the recent surge in prices in Shanghai is due to the sharp contraction of the black market exchange rate, coupled with the outbreak of the European war and the difficulty of transportation in Shanghai. These are certainly sufficient reasons. However, in reality, there is another cause that cannot be ignored, which is the psychological effect of the general merchants and people. In the speculative psychology of a few industrialists and businessmen, they yearn for the easy profits during the First World War and deliberately raise the prices of various foreign goods; they even prefer to temporarily suspend transactions and hoard various foreign goods. They hope that, as in the past, the prices of things like dyes and fuses will rise to more than 400 times their original price; but they do not know that the economic and military capabilities of Germany this time are far less than they were in the past, and it may not be able to sustain the last European war for such a long time. At the same time, they are also aware of the volatile situation in the Far East, and they also use the excuse of difficult transportation of domestic goods to raise prices. In addition, ordinary residents, because of the continuous increase in prices, are dominated by a sense of fear. To avoid the losses of continued price increases, they try their best to store various supplies necessary for life. This sudden increase in demand naturally accelerates the rise in prices. This newspaper has repeatedly pointed out that today's Shanghai is no longer the Shanghai of the First World War period. In the past, Shanghai had extensive connections with the vast inland areas economically, so after the interruption of Eurasian transportation, it promoted the extreme prosperity of Shanghai's industries and businesses. Therefore, a part of the raw materials and tools urgently needed by Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles that could not be produced domestically were able to rise sharply in price. However, the current Shanghai exists under special circumstances. The economic relationship with the occupied areas is simply a risky undertaking; and commerce with the inland areas is severely restricted due to special circumstances. Relatively speaking, the only free thing is foreign trade. If Shanghai's overseas transportation is cut off, it will inevitably become a truly isolated island. At that time, the raw materials that Shanghai needs will of course have no way to purchase, and Shanghai's commodities will have no market to sell. Where can high-priced foreign goods be sold, and various daily necessities may not be easily bought and sold at high prices. In short, the soaring prices caused by speculative psychology are not only an illusion but also a suicidal policy. As for ordinary residents storing commodities, it is also close to ignorance; because after the stored commodities are exhausted, will they not suffer the same impact of rising prices? Moreover, whether prices will continue to rise is used as a reason for storing, but whether prices will continue to rise is fundamentally a question.</p>
<p>The rise in prices during extraordinary times is a common thing. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, prices in the Chinese mainland were higher than before the war. After the outbreak of the European war this time, prices in countries such as Britain and France also rose immediately. Such an increase in prices is a consistent trend in all industrial sectors, and the impact on the lives of ordinary people is relatively small; moreover, under government control, there are appropriate measures to deal with it, and it will never be allowed to cause a major social crisis. However, the current Shanghai, due to its complex international relations, has invisibly become a free city; the laws and regulations of the Chinese government cannot be enforced temporarily, and only a few unscrupulous merchants are allowed to engage in speculative activities in the market; in addition, Shanghai's industries and businesses, under the current circumstances, cannot establish close ties with any place. The unresolved problem of food rice for a long time is a good example.</p>
<p>In the past, we have requested the authorities responsible for public security in the concessions to strictly monitor Shanghai's economic activities, and we have also requested speculative merchants to abandon the attempt to profit from disasters out of human sympathy, but due to the limitations of the facts, the effect has been minimal. In fact, dwelling on how Shanghai is and how it is is not of much significance; fundamentally, one should ignore how safe Shanghai is and how prices are, and go to the southwest as much as possible and go deep into the interior. Build a future paradise with your own labor and money. If you want to solve the difficult problems of national industries and businesses during wartime, you can only try your best to move capital inland, so as to avoid the various exploitations and oppressions of the special environment, and at the same time, you can also receive various help and rewards from the government. In that case, you can not only get rid of the exploitation you can encounter in Shanghai, but also fully assume the responsibility of a national standard.</p>

<h3>England and France Thoroughly Cooperate in Politics and Military to Overthrow National Socialism</h3>
<p>The Two Countries Held a Joint Military Meeting Yesterday, Chamberlain Reported on the War Situation to the House of Commons</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated the details of yesterday's Supreme Military Council meeting to the House of Commons today, saying that the purpose of the meeting was to allow direct personal exchange of opinions between the British and French commanders in the earliest possible stage of the war. Both sides fully studied the current situation and discussed the plans to be taken in the near future. Meetings will continue to be held when necessary, so that the two countries can maintain the closest possible contact on all key aspects of conducting the war, and of course, exchange views on the current situation of the two countries. The Prime Minister said, "I am very happy to assure the House of Commons that the public opinion on both sides of the English Channel is completely aligned. The people of France and England are not only determined to fully respect their obligations to Poland, but also determined to persist to the end, ending the intolerable pain of living under the threat of Nazi aggression, as a one-time solution. French comrades, like us, are a nation that truly loves peace, but they realize that there can be no peace until Hitlerism is completely eliminated, which is no less than our own." The Prime Minister then briefly described the current situation on the various battlefields, saying that "new evidence of the determination of the overseas autonomous territories is now being transmitted every day, not only in words, but also in actions. Several steps of a far-reaching nature have been taken in the military and civil affairs, all of which are moving towards a single goal, that is, to carry out a common aspiration and fulfill a common mission." The Prime Minister continued, saying that the number of foreign countries declaring neutrality is increasing, but the European armed alert, which was caused by the direct threat of the Nazis to civilization, has not been relaxed. The Eastern Front is still the main center of operations. The German army seems to be trying to win a quick victory on the Eastern Front to avoid being forced to transfer troops to the Western border to cope with the threat of an attack by our allies. The reason why Germany has not been able to move troops to the West so far is due to the indomitable spirit of the Poles, who are not subdued by the material pressure they have encountered or the absolute superiority of the German air force. On the Western Front, the French army has begun a systematic advance, which is a major and significant initial phenomenon. The French side, of course, maintains silence on this, but what has been discovered so far is that the French army has achieved complete success. There is now a certain statement saying that the British Expeditionary Force has fought with the enemy on the border. Although this statement is not very accurate, the British army has indeed arrived in France, but has not yet participated in the war. As for the air force, normal reconnaissance and patrol work continues. Several squadrons of the Royal Air Force are now operating from French territory. The British Air Force continues to conduct reconnaissance flights over German skies and has obtained a lot of useful information about the activities behind the German lines."</p>
<p>United Party member Adams rose to speak and asked whether the government was considering issuing a statement on the war's aims, including helping the Czechs break away from German rule.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister replied that the best way to know the government's war aims was to refer to the various principles it had published, and that Britain had joined the war to safeguard these principles. The Prime Minister went on to mention his telegram to the former Czech President Benes, which stated that "the various principles that led us to join the war are expected to triumph and enable the Czech nation to break away from foreign rule." (Loud cheers) (Reuters dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<h3>Details of the Supreme National Defense Council Meeting</h3>
<p>(London) The Anglo-French Supreme Military Council met yesterday and confirmed the determination of Britain and France to wage the war with all their human and material resources and to provide all possible assistance to the brave and resistant Poland. This was the first meeting held in France since the outbreak of the war. The British representatives were Prime Minister Chamberlain and the Minister for Coordination of Defence, Admiral Chatsfield. The French representatives were Prime Minister Daladier and General Gamelin, Commander-in-Chief of the Anglo-French Allied Forces on the Western Front. The Italians took military aircraft between England and France. The purpose of the meeting was to directly exchange views on the current situation and the plans to be adopted in the future. According to observers, the fact that this first meeting was held less than ten days after the outbreak of the war shows the long-standing close relationship and absolute trust between the governments of Britain and France. The personal contact between the authorities of the two countries also demonstrates the intention of the two governments to cooperate effectively in order to implement their well-prepared and rapidly implementable plans. Londoners learned of the news of the meeting between the British and French authorities and the landing of British troops in France, which has aroused a very good impression, recognizing this as clear evidence of Britain and France actively preparing to move towards their common goal. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>It is reported that British Prime Minister Chamberlain strongly advocated at yesterday's meeting that no separate peace should be made with Germany, so that even if all of Poland falls, the war will not be stopped as a result. It is generally believed here that Germany wants to break the Anglo-French cooperative front by means of an indirect solution, but since Chamberlain and Daladier have announced their close cooperation, the two countries must provide all kinds of assistance to Poland. In addition, the Supreme Council also studied the status of Italy as a neutral country. Prime Minister Chamberlain and Sir Chatfield traveled to France on the Royal Air Force's fastest aircraft, which had an average speed of 300 miles per hour and was protected by a squadron of fighter jets. It was learned here that the meeting was held at the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street until late last night. The Supreme Council will be held from time to time in the future. (Associated Press, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French semi-official circles attach great importance to the joint meeting of the Anglo-French Supreme National Defense Committee, saying that this meeting was technically prepared in advance by the military authorities of both countries, and will continue to be held in the future. The actions of the two countries are both parallel and integrated. The last paragraph of the communique praises Poland's heroic resistance and declares that Britain and France are determined to provide full assistance, so that Germany will not be able to use its divisive tricks. In short, the war between France and France will not be localized. In addition to the cooperation between the various parts of the British Empire and Britain, Britain and France are also jointly planning to deal with Germany economically, in order to cut off its sources of supply. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The newspapers in this area have unanimously praised the joint meeting of the Anglo-French Supreme National Defense Committee, saying that this is the best answer to the speech given by German Aviation Minister Goering on the 10th of this month. The hope that the country's authorities want to avoid defeat and thus conduct peace talks has vanished. In addition, the military cooperation between Britain and France was very slow at the beginning of the First European War in 1914, but it has now been completed quickly, which is a good thing. The right-wing newspaper "Le Petit Parisien" reported that the statements made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Daladier in their respective parliaments have now been reiterated in the joint communique, and their nature is more solemn. Since Hitler has taken the risk of being unscrupulous, which is deeply hated, Britain and France will never allow him to evade responsibility and escape all consequences. The right-wing newspaper "L'Action Française" reported that "This communique is of great significance. In other words, Britain and France will never make peace with Germany alone, and will continue to fight until Poland has completely regained its freedom. All these countries will provide full assistance to the heroic Poland." The right-wing newspaper "Le Temps" reported that "Prime Minister Daladier secretly went to a place between Paris and London at 9 a.m. yesterday to meet with Prime Minister Chamberlain, and returned as early as 5:30 p.m." (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Britain Will Not Recognize Germany's Annexation of Czechoslovakia and Danzig</h3>
<p>It is Only Regarded as a German-Occupied Area. Czech Soldiers Refuse to Fight and Are Disarmed. Czechs in France Are Organized into an Army</p>
<p>(London) The Foreign Office issued a statement stating that the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia in Czechoslovakia, the Slovakian state, and the Free City of Danzig should all be regarded as German-occupied areas. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to news received by French semi-official sources from Bratislava (formerly in Czech territory), a large unit of Slovakian soldiers refused to board a train to the Polish front yesterday, with soldiers saying they were unwilling to fight the Polish. Several people were arrested in the Bratislava barracks, and it is now known that Slovaks who are aviators are not allowed to fly aircraft. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>The Hague "People's Newspaper" recently reported that the number of Slovakian soldiers who fled to Hungary because they were unwilling to fight against Poland has reached as many as 10,000, all of whom have been sent to Gaja City by the Hungarian government for shelter. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Czechs throughout France are now enlisting in the ranks one after another. The French authorities plan to form two divisions of Czech troops to fight alongside the British and French armies. They will be trained by 600 officers and non-commissioned officers who fled from the Czech Republic in March. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>People of New Zealand Eagerly Enlist</h3>
<p>(London) The Information Department issued a statement stating that the subjects of the New Zealand self-governing dominion have been very enthusiastic about enlisting in the army in recent days. The authorities plan to recruit thousands of new soldiers there, but on the first day, more than 2,100 people signed up, so it is expected that the required number will be recruited within a few days. In addition, the original quota of 18,000 reservists in the autonomous territory has now been increased to 30,000. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) The New Zealand autonomous territory House of Representatives passed a bill today to grant the autonomous territory government special privileges to strengthen national defense and maintain public order. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Canada Revises Budget</h3>
<p>Ottawa Canadian Finance Minister Ilsley submitted a revised budget to the House of Commons today, increasing excess profits tax, income tax, and taxes on tobacco, alcohol, tea, and coffee to cope with wartime expenses. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>German Submarines Are Rampant in the Atlantic Ocean. Another British Cargo Ship Was Sunk. A Finnish Ship Was Sunk by a Torpedo.</h3>
<p>The United States Considers Its Attitude Towards Navigation Issues</p>
<p>(London) The British merchant ship "Braerock", owned by the Lyle and Hogarth Shipping Company, which was recently sunk by the Germans, had a displacement of 3,071 tons and was sunk off the coast of Ireland before dusk yesterday. However, all the crew members were rescued by the American ship "American Shipper", which returned from 150 miles away to provide assistance. In addition, the British ship "Inverflesk", with a displacement of 9,465 tons, was also sunk by a German submarine with a torpedo yesterday. All the crew members were rescued by the American ship "Stuart", which rushed to provide assistance. It is reported that another four British merchant ships were attacked by German submarines yesterday, but all of them managed to escape safely.

<h3>American Aircraft Will Expand Market in China</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to news here today, in the first seven months of this year, 86% of U.S. aircraft exports were to countries such as Britain and France, totaling US$108,000,000. However, since the outbreak in Europe, the U.S. neutrality law has taken effect for the warring countries, so 86% of U.S. aircraft exports have been stranded. The only remaining aircraft markets for the United States are China, South America, the Netherlands, and India. According to experts, China's civil aviation still has the potential for continued development, so the United States may as well sell its remaining aircraft to China.

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt gave a speech at Queen's University in Kingston, Canada, on August 19 last year, stating that "The Americas are no longer a distant continent that cannot be shaken by overseas disputes. If Canadian territory is threatened, the American people will not stand idly by." The President told the press that this speech also applies to the territories in the Americas held by European countries, such as British Guiana, British Honduras, Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Saint Pierre. The essence of the Monroe Doctrine has always been to prevent new empires from plundering the territories of American countries, or plundering the territories in the Americas held by European countries, and my speech at Kingston University only reiterated this traditional attitude of the American government. Now that the American government and the other countries of the American continent get along very well, and they are also on friendly terms with the European countries that originally held territories or islands on the American continent, the United States does not want to see other European countries have intentions on these territories and islands. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The scope of the American Monroe Doctrine has been expanded by President Roosevelt to include the territories of European countries in the Western Hemisphere.

<h3>The New Abe Cabinet Announces Its Political Program, and the Prime Minister's Power Is Increased</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Abe Cabinet's political program and policies were officially decided on the 12th. Prime Minister Abe paid a visit to the Emperor at 11:30 this morning and presented them. The contents were announced at noon as follows: "The current cabinet will continue to work hard to adjust diplomacy and strengthen national defense, stabilize the lives of the rear, and implement the following key tasks in the current serious situation: (2) The fundamental policy places the core of policy on handling the China Incident and adhering to an independent position abroad to deal with complex and delicate international situations. Domestically, it will strive to enrich military preparations and cultivate basic national strength, and integrate and concentrate all internal and external policies on this purpose, with the expectation of realizing the unity of Japan and Manchuria and a new relationship between China and Japan. handling the China Incident, handling the China Incident is an unchangeable fundamental policy that has already been decided. Japan should go on to assist the establishment of a "new government" and cooperate in implementing appropriate policies in order to achieve the purpose of handling the incident. (3) Comprehensive economic power: Due to the current tense international situation, expand productivity to achieve self-sufficiency in defense resources, and at the same time strengthen the trade system to adapt to the new situation.

<p>(Tokyo) This morning, all Japanese newspapers predicted that Japan's policy towards China would be reactivated. Prime Minister Abe proposed at a cabinet meeting yesterday that a new important legal system should be passed to give the Prime Minister the highest power over his cabinet members in handling important state affairs, and to bear the highest responsibility. It is reported that this state affairs refers to handling the China Incident within the scope of the constitutional provisions, and contains the understanding that it does not infringe on the Emperor's privileges, that is, "supreme command". It is reported that cabinet members unanimously agreed on the need for military, civilian, and political cabinet members to act in unison to promote national policies. Therefore, the Prime Minister will meet with the Emperor today to report on the important changes in national policy and submit the cabinet's major policy guidelines. According to Article 55 of the Constitution, cabinet members are responsible to the Emperor for the political affairs of their respective ministries. The Prime Minister's task is to ensure the unity of the cabinet, but has no active power over his colleagues, which has not changed to date. Therefore, the decision of important national policies is often hindered by the opposition of one cabinet member, which has been seen repeatedly, and even more so in the Hiranuma cabinet.

<h3>Japan's Foreign Trade Has a Large Excess of Imports</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Ministry of Finance today, although Japan's trade with "Manchukuo" and the occupied areas of China from January to August this year was a surplus, its trade with countries outside the Japanese bloc was mostly an excess of imports. It is estimated that during this period, Japan's surplus from exports to the Japanese bloc reached 127,000,000 yen, but its excess of imports from other countries in the same period was as high as 442,000,000 yen. Therefore, in fact, "Manchukuo" and the occupied areas of China still cannot remedy the disadvantage of its excess of imports. (Associated Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Imminent US Congressional Session; Factional Strife Begins; Isolationist Congressmen Vociferously Oppose Amending the Neutrality Act</h3>
<p>(Washington) The convocation of the special session of Congress is near. Members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives have gradually returned to the capital. Isolationist senators such as Borah, Nye, Vandenberg, and Thomas are planning to obstruct the amendment of the Neutrality Act and have already begun their opposition work. Nye recently released a statement to the various newspapers, stating, "If the United States supplies munitions to the belligerent nations, it will inevitably become more concerned about the outcome of the war. It will also be easier to enter the vortex of war. This is why I oppose repealing the arms embargo clause." Nye also told a Havas reporter, "This clause will probably be repealed in the end. Once the Senate reconvenes, I will try to extend the session so that I can appeal to public opinion and at the same time monitor the government's actions." Borah also firmly expressed his opposition to amending the Neutrality Act and issued the slogan, "Repealing the arms embargo is tantamount to being drawn into the vortex of war." This statement represents the views of the general opposition. According to this faction, President Roosevelt intends to assist the democratic nations of Europe, which violates the true spirit of the Neutrality Act and should therefore be obstructed with all efforts. However, the government still expresses confidence that it will gain the support of a large majority after Congress reconvenes. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Chairman of the House Rules Committee, Sabath, recently spoke with President Roosevelt and told reporters afterward that the President would convene Congress for a special session on October 2 to amend the Neutrality Act and repeal the arms embargo clause. President Roosevelt also told reporters, "I am about to issue a statement," but the meaning of "about to" was not specified. Regarding the reconvening of Congress, the date mentioned by Sabath, like the reports in various newspapers, is speculative. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) It was announced here yesterday that Congress would convene a special session at the end of this month. The announcement was made by the Chairman of the House Rules Committee, Pace, after meeting with President Roosevelt. Pace stated that the special session would consider amending the Neutrality Act. At this time, isolationist Senators Borah and Nye vehemently opposed any changes to the Neutrality Act. Nye stated that he would lead a "last-ditch stand" to oppose amending the Neutrality Act, "because amending the Neutrality Act will inevitably draw our country into the vortex of war."

<h3>USSR Holds Significant Weight in the Future of the European Situation; Concentrating Troops and Observing Changes; Rumors of a Non-Aggression Pact Between the USSR and Turkey</h3>
<p>Cities of Debrecen and Basel, Switzerland. The correspondent for the Basler Nachrichten in the Latvian capital recently published an article in that newspaper entitled, "Will the Soviet Union No Longer Remain Passive?" It stated, "The Soviet Union has never pretended regarding the Polish issue, but the authorities of that country seem no longer satisfied with this. According to experts, the total number of Soviet ground forces has recently increased to two million men. The number of troops stationed in the military districts of Kiev, Chernigov, Minsk, and Leningrad has increased even more. Moreover, Soviet newspapers have recently shown a tendency to ease their stance toward Great Britain. Therefore, it is generally believed that if the related countries engage in negotiations in the future, Stalin will hardly be content to remain uninvolved." (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Political figures here are paying close attention to the news that the Turkish Foreign Minister will soon visit Moscow to conclude a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. It is believed that this decision is related to the Turkish Prime Minister's declaration of foreign policy the day before yesterday. Forty-eight hours ago, France released information stating that Turkey would declare war on Germany. However, in view of the Turkish Prime Minister's declaration and the Turkish Foreign Minister's invitation to the Soviet Union, this rumor has been disproven. It is therefore believed here that the Anglo-Turkish pact that Britain hopes to conclude will be difficult to realize in the near future. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)</p>

The Danish government has invited the heads of government of the Scandinavian countries (i.e., Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland) to hold a summit meeting, to be held in Copenhagen from September 18 to 19, to discuss the four countries' future diplomatic and trade policies toward the belligerent nations. One of the main issues is the future trade relations between the Scandinavian countries and the belligerent nations: whether export trade should be calculated as a percentage or whether an equal quantity of goods should be shipped to both belligerent nations. This is a matter that urgently needs to be decided. It is said that the heads of government of the Scandinavian countries will be accompanied by their foreign ministers and economic experts to attend the meeting. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>Finland Expresses Strict Neutrality; Will Maintain Trade Relations with Belligerent Nations</h3>
<p>Helsinki. Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko gave a speech on the radio about Finland's neutrality policy, stating, "Finland is determined to strictly adhere to neutrality and avoid being drawn into the vortex of war, but will repel any attempts to undermine Finland's neutrality. The status of neutral countries today is different from that during the First World War in 1914. Today, neutral countries have not only increased in number but also are stronger in terms of strength than in the past. Finland will maintain trade relations with the belligerent countries to the greatest extent possible. The only obligation of the Finnish people is to avoid engaging in activities that cause misunderstandings, so that the government can maintain its neutrality policy without hindrance. In addition, the cooperation of the Oslo Convention countries is of great importance to the maintenance of neutrality by each country. No country should disregard the neutrality of other countries and take this risk." (Haitong dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Germany Will Send Large Numbers of Aircraft to Retaliate Against the British Blockade; Germany Admits That the Impact of the Blockade is Serious; The London Times Points Out the German Crisis</h3>
<p>Copenhagen. According to the Berlin correspondent of a Danish newspaper, Germany will send 3,000 aircraft to bomb British seaports in retaliation for the British blockade. Germany admits that the result of the blockade has placed them in a serious position, but Germany will respond with aircraft and submarines. According to opinions in Berlin, destroying British seaports is the most effective way to counter the British naval blockade of Germany. The German side has declared to all neutral countries that if they do not quickly protest this blockade method to Britain and advise the British government to change its mind, then they will probably suffer the pain of war. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Budapest, the capital of Hungary. The semi-official Hungarian newspaper Magyar Hírlap recently published a telegram from its Berlin correspondent stating that responsible German officials said that the blockade announced by Britain was "a declaration of economic warfare." The German authorities are considering countermeasures and have ordered the submarine fleet to use [any means] in combat. However, the German authorities [are also] [negotiating] with Denmark to ease the blockade policy. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) Today's Times carried an article stating that over the long term, Hitlerism is not only economically and financially fragile but also spiritually unsound, and will inevitably face failure and subversion. Today, Germany's sources of borrowing have dried up, its cash reserves are quite depleted, and it is in dire need of foreign exchange. What the Nazi Party can buy at present cannot even be compared with the German Empire at the end of the Great War. Yesterday, the German mark had no exchange rate in Amsterdam. It is ridiculous for the Germans to claim that as a result of conquering Poland, Germany's coal production can increase by 25 percent, steel production can exceed 2 million tons, and zinc production can reach 100,000 tons. Even if this situation were true, it would not be worth our full attention. During the last World War, the German Empire seized everything in Poland, and the raw materials and food in Belgium and northern France, as well as in the eastern, northeastern, and southeastern war zones of Germany, were all under its control. However, the output of the above-mentioned vast territory (almost four times the area ruled by the Nazi Party) was still insufficient. The British Navy in those days and today is in the same position, that is, implementing a strict blockade to cut off all important sources of supply to Germany. The article concluded that between 1914 and 1918, Germany still had sufficient cash reserves and credit to purchase goods from neutral neighboring countries. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Duke of Windsor Returns to England; First Time Returning Home Since Abdication</h3>
<p>(London) The Duke of Windsor returned to England with his wife yesterday after three years abroad. This is the Duke of Windsor's first return to England since abdicating the throne in December 1936. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The Duke and Duchess of Windsor arrived in Portsmouth from France today. Because the authorities kept the matter a secret, very few people knew about it beforehand. The Duke of Windsor hastily left the country after abdicating on December 10, 1936. Prime Minister Chamberlain met with the Duke in Paris last year and told him that if he returned to the country, there would no longer be any political obstacles. However, it was not until recently, when the Duke volunteered to serve the country because of the outbreak of the European war, that he was allowed to return. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>He Yingqin Speaks; General Counteroffensive is Not Far Off; Japanese Offensives Will Inevitably Suffer a Crushing Defeat in the Future; Even After Shortening the Front Lines, Their Troop Strength Will Still Be Insufficient</h3>
<p>Chongqing. Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin told an Associated Press reporter today that Chinese guerrillas are constantly cutting off Japanese transportation lines and intercepting the Japanese army's rear. A full-scale offensive, with Chinese regular troops and guerrillas cooperating with each other, is not far off. In short, all of China's military forces are now prepared for the final general counteroffensive. Although the European war will have a considerable impact on the supply of Chinese munitions, we have accumulated sufficient munitions over the years. At the same time, there are other ways to obtain foreign munitions. Furthermore, many light weapons can already be manufactured domestically. Although the mortar shells used by Chinese guerrillas still have to rely on external supply, other small arms are mostly self-sufficient. As for when we launch our general counteroffensive, we will use a large number of tanks and heavy weapons, because without this, it is not enough to talk about offensive. He Yingqin spoke of future offensives by the Japanese side, believing that they will again suffer a crushing defeat like the Japanese army suffered in northern Hubei in April. The reason for the Japanese army's crushing defeat in northern Hubei was that the Chinese side adopted a strategy of attacking the Japanese army's rear. He also said that if the Japanese army attempts to advance further, they must increase their troop strength to maintain their rear transportation lines. In other words, further advances by the Japanese army would be beneficial to the Chinese side. From a military point of view, Japan has absolutely no possibility of conquering China. If Japan wants to conquer China, it must first eliminate 200 Chinese divisions in one breath. However, from the Battle of Shanghai to the Battle of Wuhan, the Chinese side had gathered as many as 80 to 90 divisions in places such as Nanjing and Xuzhou. The Japanese side at that time used all their elite troops, but they could not eliminate the main force of the Chinese side. Not only could they not eliminate the main force of the Chinese side, but even a single brigade or regiment was not eliminated by the Japanese army. Since the Japanese side could not eliminate the main force of the Chinese side during the Battle of Shanghai and the Battle of Wuhan, then after the transportation lines are expanded and the terrain is favorable to the Chinese side, it will be even more impossible to eliminate the Chinese forces. Speaking of whether the Japanese side could stand firm if they shortened the front lines, abandoning Guangdong, with the Yangtze River as the southern boundary, the Pinghan Railway as the western boundary, and then crossing the Yellow River to Suiyuan in northern China, He Yingqin believed that this area was still too large for the Japanese side's current troop strength to handle. Moreover, there are many mountains in this area that can serve as bases for Chinese guerrillas, who can continuously attack the Japanese army and gradually deplete them. If the Japanese army carries out "pacification" operations, the Chinese forces in this area will be divided into smaller units, not by division but by brigade or regiment, in order to increase mobility and striking power. He Yingqin continued that the war in Europe and Japan's blockade of China cannot shake China's anti-Japanese war plan for the next two or three years. No matter what strategy the Japanese side adopts, we will definitely resist to the end. If the Japanese recognize that the war against China has ended, and hope to establish a puppet government and withdraw troops, then our supreme leader, General Chiang Kai-shek, will command a large army to drive out the puppets and the Japanese. Speaking of the actual situation of the guerrillas, He Yingqin stated that Japan has a total troop strength of 38 and a half divisions. When Wuhan fell, 31 divisions were sent to China. They also had to guard against the Soviet Union, so in fact they had no troops to transfer. Furthermore, offensive operations are already difficult, because most of the troops now have to protect transportation lines and suppress the occupied areas. The Japanese side is currently most concerned with the "pacification" work of the guerrillas in the three provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, and Shandong. Therefore, the troop strength in those areas has obviously increased, especially in Shanxi. However, the Japanese side has launched eight attacks on the Zhongtiao Mountains in Shanxi, all of which have failed. They have also launched three attacks on the Taihang Mountains, all of which have been unsuccessful. The reason why the Japanese side is particularly focusing on the west is that if Shanxi can be captured, the supply to the Chinese guerrillas in Hebei and northern Shanxi will be cut off. However, the Japanese side's attempt is difficult to succeed. In the Japanese army's "pacification" war against the guerrillas, the death ratio between the Chinese and Japanese sides is "two Japanese for every one Chinese." The reason for this is that the Chinese side avoids positional warfare and adopts mobile warfare. At the same time, the Chinese side also selects favorable terrain to fight the Japanese army. According to He Yingqin, based on the results of the Nanyue Conference in November last year, the Chinese military authorities sent 500,000 regular troops to the guerrilla areas to reorganize the guerrilla forces. Therefore, the current guerrillas can truly strike the Japanese side. According to He Yingqin, of the 933 counties that have previously fallen to the Japanese side, Japanese troops are only seen in 521 counties. Japanese troops are never seen in the remaining counties, and the Chinese side holds full authority. (Associated Press dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>Chinese Army in Southern Hebei Encircles Daming</h3>
<p>A certain place in southern Hebei. After the two counties of Qingfeng and Puyang in southern Hebei were recaptured by the Chinese army last month, the Japanese troops entrenched in Daming were restrained. Moreover, the Chinese army continued to advance and has now completed the encirclement of Daming. On the 9th, more than 500 Japanese troops from Handan were ambushed and defeated by a certain unit of the Chinese army in Weixian Town and Yangxiaozhuang while on their way to reinforce.

<h3>Continued Fierce Fighting Between Changzhi and Changzi</h3>
<p>Xingji: The offensive and defensive battles for Changzi have intensified since the 6th. The Chinese army has achieved successive victories, capturing several key points near Changzi, including Bao Village, Da Li Village, Shangfang Village, Hetou Village, Xiguo Village, and Dongsong Village, directly threatening the southwest gates of the city. Subsequently, they seized the north, attempting to cut off the communication line between Boli, Changzhi, and Changzi. By this point, Japanese losses had reached 1,300 to 1,400 men. Attempting to reverse the declining situation, the Japanese army transferred over 600 reinforcements from Gaohe Town (west of Changzhi) to launch a fierce attack on Shangxiaguo Village (southwest of Changzhi). Another unit, departing from Changzhi via Shangfang Village and Daguan Village, the Japanese army in Changzi also attempted to coordinate a counterattack, re-attacking Dajingjing Village (northeast of Changzi), with over 2,000 reinforcements for Changzi. Currently, a fierce battle is raging between the Chinese and Japanese armies in the area between Changzhi and Changzi. South of Xiatian (north of Changzhi), Japanese ammunition and military supplies are being transported elsewhere in succession, indicating a possible retreat to the north. (13th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Invades Shiqi; Suffers Repeated Losses</h3>
<p>Macau: Information received here indicates that the Japanese army is currently trying to invade Shiqi from Hengmen, but has lost ten motorboats today. It is also reported that the peasant militia of Zhangjiabian Village, near the place where a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) aircraft was forced to land by Japanese aircraft last year, is now firmly resisting the Japanese army's invasion. The Japanese army is attempting to force the Zhongshan defending forces to retreat west of Shiqi and is preparing to attack near Tangjia, sending cavalry to harass, but seems hesitant to cross the waterway and invade. The waterway to Shiqi has been sealed off due to the Japanese army's invasion, resulting in a cutoff of food supplies. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army's Large-Scale Invasion Imminent</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Newspapers here generally believe that General Nishio's appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in China foreshadows the imminent large-scale invasion of the interior. The "Saodang Daily" published an editorial on this matter this morning, advocating that the Chinese side must strengthen the defense of all lines to cope with the impending Japanese offensive. If Wang Jingwei establishes a "Central Government" under the protection of the Japanese side, if the Chinese side can achieve a significant military victory, the attempt to create a puppet organization will inevitably fail.

<h3>Floods Strike China; Japanese Army Suffers Significant Losses; Most Small Japanese Businessmen Will Go Bankrupt; Japanese Troops Retreat from Most Towns in Hebei; Sino-Japanese War May Have Unexpected Ending</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported from Beijing on August 31st that since the fall of Hankou and Guangzhou a year ago, the political, economic, and military positions of the Japanese in North China have undergone significant changes. At that time, the loss of these two cities greatly shook the confidence of knowledgeable Chinese in the perseverance and ultimate victory of the Chinese government. The Japanese had high hopes that Wu Peifu would establish a truly stable government in North China. However, these hopes soon began to fade, and the desire to establish a united pro-Japanese country in North China became a pipe dream.</p>
<p>There are three reasons for this: first, disagreements among the various factions of the Japanese army; second, the Japanese financial policy caused economic chaos in North China; and third, the Japanese army failed to eliminate the guerrillas in North China. To this day, the hope of establishing an independent country in North China is even more distant than before. A year ago, the grand plans for the revival of companies with Japanese capital reaching countless millions of yen, the construction of railways, the opening of highways, and the development of mines were all announced. Many factories were indeed built in the suburbs of Tianjin, and small Japanese shopkeepers and merchants followed suit, bringing their small savings and hoping to get rich in North China. However, to date, none of these plans have been realized, and most small Japanese businessmen are on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The main reason for this situation is that Japanese military experts adopted a policy of attacking the legal tender, plunging the North China financial system into extreme chaos. The "Federal Reserve Notes" plummeted, causing the yen to depreciate as well. The yen capital of companies intending to engage in reconstruction work must now be at least doubled compared to what was announced a year ago. Railway transportation is one of the most obvious signs of deterioration, and it has never been as chaotic as it is now in the past twenty-five years. This chaos is, of course, partly due to the floods that North China encountered this summer. However, even before the floods damaged the railway transportation, there was a severe shortage of all kinds of train cars, and the Japanese could not purchase cars to replenish them due to a lack of necessary foreign exchange. Even worse was the Tianjin flood.</p>
<p>Causing the Japanese huge economic losses, goods worth millions of Japanese yen and a large amount of military supplies were destroyed. Hundreds of houses in the Japanese concession must be rebuilt, and many newly built factories were severely damaged and are completely useless. The capital of thousands of small Japanese businessmen was completely lost. The worst thing is that 2 million customers have lost their purchasing power. The cotton harvest in southern Hebei was completely destroyed. However, when the Japanese army set out to China with the intention of taking risks, one of the baits used to lure Japanese business circles was North China's raw cotton. The Japanese army has been conducting a campaign to suppress guerrillas for more than a year, but has not achieved significant victory. The guerrillas are as active as ever in and around Beijing and in the mountains along the Pingjin Railway. Due to the flood, the Japanese troops stationed in various towns in central Hebei have mostly withdrawn. The Japanese army boasted that the flood could drive out the guerrillas, but they themselves were also driven away. The flood did not help the Japanese army at all. The war in southern Shanxi, which the Japanese army has been conducting for several months, has not been victorious and has been very costly. Although the new Mongolian government has recently been established, the Japanese troops stationed in northern Suiyuan are now under great threat. The Japanese army does not have enough troops to pacify North China, and it is heard that in recent weeks, even more Japanese troops have been transferred from Beijing to the Northeast. The recent signing of a non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet Union was a particularly significant blow to the Japanese military in North China.</p>
<p>Japanese civilians have many complaints about the improper manipulation of Japanese foreign policy by the military, and the Japanese military, not a few weeks ago, was still assuring the whole country that solving all their difficulties lay in forging a military alliance with the then-prevailing anti-communist axis. The recent sudden change in Soviet policy, ordinary people dare not rashly guess what kind of policy the Soviet Union will take in the Far East, but the Japanese military circles here believe that after Germany and the Soviet Union sign the agreement, the Soviet Union will increase military pressure on the border of Manchuria. Even the most arrogant Japanese warlords no longer believe that Japan can fight China and the Soviet Union at the same time, because Japan has been trapped in the Chinese quagmire for two years and its resources have been exhausted. The current military has separated a large number of troops and military supplies to Manchuria front line, will certainly not help the revival and pacification of North China, the Chinese asked recently spread strange rumors, said that the Japanese army will withdraw from China soon, these rumors, of course, only the idea of hope, but the rumors and the pessimism and melancholy of the Japanese here, at least a sign of the difficulties encountered by the Japanese side in North China, some observers, expect that if the Soviet Union threatens "Manchukuo" becomes a reality, and the situation there is getting worse, or will make the Sino-Japanese war sooner than expected.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Government Implements Control of Public Utilities; German Nationals Reside in Concentration Camp</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Since the outbreak of the European War, the British government has been very effective in maintaining the security of Hong Kong, an important port in the Far East. The German nationals who had been living in Hong Kong have had their freedom of movement restricted and have been accommodated in a concentration camp. There are 92 men and women residing in the camp. Daily life in the camp is scheduled, and food is supplied as usual. It is also stipulated that relatives of the Germans are allowed to visit on Wednesdays and Saturdays. In addition, everything is treated very well.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Kowloon are in a state of war, so all public utilities are controlled by the government. This is a necessary measure to maintain wartime security. The controlled items are approximately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Implementation of Telegraph Censorship: Hong Kong is a transportation hub in the Far East, where people from all directions gather. In order to prevent espionage activities, the government announced the following measures for censorship and restrictions on sending telegrams on the first of the month: (1) The use of codes or numerical codes is prohibited in telegrams. (2) All telegrams must be limited to using one of the following two languages: English or French. (3) The surname or shop name of the sender of the telegram must be included in the telegram and the telegram fee paid accordingly. (4) Registered telegraph addresses must not use abbreviations and must not use any other language other than English or French. After the promulgation of this ordinance, the Hong Kong overseas Chinese considered it inconvenient and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce signed a request to the Hong Kong government to allow the use of Chinese when sending telegrams. The reason is that the majority of overseas Chinese do not understand English or French. If restrictions are imposed, the impact on industry and commerce will be great. Before approval, overseas Chinese generally take their Chinese telegrams to Macau to send them.</p>
<p>(2) Execution of Mail Inspection: The government sent several mail inspectors to the Hong Kong post office at the beginning of the month to perform their duties, and appointed a director to oversee their work. All express, registered, and insured letters are inspected, and once they pass, they are delivered. Ordinary letters, postcards, and commercial documents that are mailed according to procedures will not be withheld, but delays are inevitable. Small parcels, packages, printed matter, and samples are completely suspended from mailing. If printed matter is certified by the chief inspector, it can still be mailed as ordinary mail.</p>
<p>(3) Control of Foreign Exchange: In order to maintain the British foreign exchange resources, the Hong Kong government has implemented restrictions on the transaction of various currencies in the Hong Kong financial market, except for the British pound, from September 8, 1939. Those who want to purchase foreign exchange can only do so through one of the British banks authorized by the Hong Kong government or one of the foreign banks operating in Hong Kong. Foreign exchange can only be sold if the following conditions are met: 1. Needs arising from contracts signed before September 3, 1939; 2. Reasonable commercial needs; 3. Reasonable expenses for travel or personal use. The currencies subject to restrictions include common silver coins of the United States, France, the Philippines, the Netherlands, China, Argentina, Canada, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, and Belgium. Transactions in British pounds and currencies linked to the British pound are currently not restricted. All banknotes, gold coins, securities, and currencies of various countries are strictly prohibited from being smuggled out of the country without special permission from the government. However, Hong Kong banknotes and Chinese banknotes can still be freely transported out with the special permission of the Governor of Hong Kong. Regarding gold coin transactions, private transactions are not allowed without a special permit. It is found that Hong Kong's foreign exchange to Germany has been completely stopped. The price of Chinese national currency in Hong Kong has suddenly risen from 29 to 33 (that is, 100 Chinese national currency yuan is worth 33 Hong Kong dollars).</p>
<p>(4) Control of Food: Food control in Hong Kong is handled by a commissioner. The commissioner is a British person named Thunter. Yesterday, Thunter instructed food merchants not to take the opportunity to manipulate food prices and prohibited overseas Chinese from hoarding. The purchase of rice should only be sufficient for daily use and should not be excessively mixed in, so as not to affect supply and demand. If rice merchants hoard, they will be sanctioned. The Food Control Commissioner has the power to restrict the production, storage, transportation, distribution, and sale of food, and, if necessary, to set public prices for food, allowing no unscrupulous merchants to manipulate prices. According to investigations, the current stock of rice in Hong Kong and Kowloon is sufficient for six months. Recently, white rice from Annam and Siam has been continuously transported to Hong Kong. On the 7th, another 15,000 bags were transported in. However, due to the current situation, the price of white rice of upper, middle, and lower grades has risen by more than 2 yuan per 100 catties.</p>

<h3>Negotiations Show No Progress; Japanese and Puppet Authorities Expand Infringement of Rights and Interests</h3>
<p>Yesterday, They Again Occupied a Giant Building on Haig Road; The Chief Inspector Expressed His Determination to Maintain Police Authority</p>
<p>The Report of the US Sending Marines to Shanghai Has Been Denied</p>
<p>It was widely rumored among foreigners the day before yesterday that the U.S. government had issued a warning to Japan, stating that the U.S. absolutely could not tolerate Japan's unilateral actions to change the status of Shanghai. However, U.S. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday at a press conference that one of the U.S. foreign policy principles is that "The U.S. opposes any unilateral change to the status of the Far East through the use of force or other means." If this is consistent, international affairs experts deduce that the U.S. will not interfere with the Japanese military's attack on the Shanghai Concessions within a certain scope, and trusts the British and French governments to handle it properly. However, if Japan's actions exceed a certain limit and harm the status of the Concessions, then the U.S. will definitely abide by its promises and take action. This is a proper argument. Unfortunately, just as the Shanghai Municipal Council was beginning negotiations with the Japanese side regarding the extension of roads beyond the boundary and the transfer of police authority, Japanese military police and puppet police suddenly occupied the building at 448 Haig Road again yesterday afternoon and stationed guards in front of the door. Their scope of action is expanding. The news obtained yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>Washington, D.C., AP, 13th: The U.S. Navy Department officially denied today reports that the Sixth Marine Regiment had been ordered to sail to China.</p>
<h3>Japanese and Puppet Authorities Invaded Haig Road Yesterday</h3>
<p>Just as the area around Siccawei Road and Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai had not yet returned to its original state before the 9th of this month, the Japanese military and puppet police, numbering more than sixty, occupied a giant building yesterday afternoon. It can be seen that their desire to be firm is endless. A reporter from the Dazhong News Agency inspected western Shanghai yesterday and witnessed the invasion of Haig Road by the Japanese and puppet authorities yesterday afternoon. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Openly Armed; Parading in Formation</p>
<p>Since before the "August 13th Incident," the Concessions had actively deployed defenses in the Haig Road area. A concrete and steel bunker was built at the end of Shanzhong Road, Route de la Consulaire, and Avenue Joffre to defend. West of Ferguson Road, all roads and alleys were equipped with barbed wire, cutting off traffic with the French Concession, because a large number of puppet police were stationed in that area, and strict precautions had to be taken. Armored vehicles were sent out on patrol from time to time, but the puppet police sometimes openly armed and paraded in formation on Haig Road. Because there was no mutual violation, no accidents occurred.</p>
<p>Occupied Giant Building; Stationed Guards at the Entrance</p>
<p>The giant building at 448 Haig Road occupies a wide area and has the beauty of a garden inside. The building is the property of a Taiwanese man named Lin. Lin passed away several years ago and his family has been living there since. Recently, there was an attempt to sell the house, but no agreement was reached. Two months ago, it was rented out to someone to open a Paradise Club. Preparations were ready and the club was about to open, but the French Concession authorities blocked its gate with obstacles, making it impossible to access. The club was dissolved. Lin's family then obtained permission from the French Concession authorities to move a small part of the barbed wire and moved back into the house. Unexpectedly, at 3:30 p.m. yesterday, more than ten Japanese military police and more than forty puppet police, divided into two military trucks, drove out of Siccawei Road and Ma Lu Bridge and went directly to the front of the building, knocked on the door, invaded, and occupied it. Armed puppet police and two Japanese military police were immediately sent to the front of the door to station guards. The owner of the house is still living inside, but Lin's family seemed to have heard the news yesterday morning and began to move some furniture and belongings out through the servants. After the Japanese and puppet authorities occupied the house, the political department of the French Concession police force sent personnel to investigate and then withdrew without comment.</p>
<p>Building Bunkers; Intent to Stay for a Long Time</p>
<p>In front of the 30th refugee shelter of the Tzu Lien Branch at 11 Siccawei Road, there are still four puppet police stationed, but the Japanese military police and puppet police inside have been reduced to more than ten. Next to the gatehouse of the house, there was a flat house where refugees lived. Yesterday, the puppet police drove out the refugees and converted it into a kitchen. The side door of the house, which was originally a temporary way in and out for refugees and middle school students, has been guarded by two puppet police every night since the night before, paying attention to the entry and exit of refugee students. All those entering and leaving 15 Siccawei Road are plainclothes police, the number is unknown. Sandbags were originally piled up at the entrance of the Xiqu Command Post of the Ma Lu Bridge Japanese military police. Since yesterday, a bunker of bricks and cement has been added around the sandbags. The situation at the staff dormitory of the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank at 1760 Jing'an Temple Road and the Siming Villa in Zhongshi New Village on Yuyuan Road remains as it was the day before. However, the number of puppet police at the entrance of the Qianjia Lane opposite Yuguang Village on Yuyuan Road has been reduced to two.</p>
<p>The negotiations on the police affairs on Outer Ring Road have now begun. The issues that will be discussed include the power of the "Municipal Government" to set up a police station on Route de Zikawei and to send police to the Outer Ring Road near the Jing'an Temple Police Station. To date, the negotiations have made little progress. At the same time, there has been no development in the western district. The "Municipal Government Police Station" has not continued to send additional police officers to the Outer Ring Road, except for the police officers sent to the Outer Ring Road on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. The whole issue is expected to be resolved through negotiations within a few days.</p>
<h3>Negotiations Have Not Made Progress</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" stated that the negotiations on the Outer Ring Road in western Shanghai were heard to have been in progress yesterday (the 12th), and no solution to the problem has been obtained. However, this matter is still kept secret. It is believed that those participating in the discussion are the consuls of the public concessions, the foreign troops stationed in the western district, and the armed Chinese police and Japanese military police hired by the so-called "Shanghai Municipal Government." As in the previous days, the situation in the district has not changed on the surface. The Shanghai Times also stated that yesterday afternoon, responsible parties heard that the Shanghai Times about western Shanghai.</p>
<h3>British and American Cooperation; Determined to Maintain</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Concessions are the only important commercial strongholds of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and other countries, and the interests of the United Kingdom in Shanghai are particularly large. The reporter therefore inquired at the British Embassy Office in Shanghai yesterday morning about the true attitude of the United Kingdom towards the Concessions issue. According to Mr. Dale Ting, the secretary of Ambassador Cole, the United Kingdom certainly cannot give up its interests in the Shanghai Concessions. We firmly believe that although the European War has broken out, the determination of the United Kingdom and the United States to cooperate and maintain the status of the Shanghai Concessions is undoubtedly.</p>
<h3>Chief Inspector Bowen; Important Expression</h3>
<p>Chief Inspector Bowen of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, who bears the highest responsibility for the police administration of the Shanghai Municipal Council, has been praised by the Japanese as "currently working hard to resolve the current difficulties." He went to Qingdao on vacation, and his duties were taken over by Smith. He recently returned to Shanghai after a three-week vacation and went to the Shanghai Municipal Council on the 11th to cancel his leave and work. He made an important statement to the visiting Japanese newspaper reporter on the issue of building roads beyond the boundary the day before yesterday: (1) The Shanghai Municipal Council is determined to maintain the original state of the police power over the extension of roads beyond the boundary. (2) The actions of the Japanese and puppet authorities in building roads beyond the boundary will be submitted to the board of directors for discussion. (3) Considering that the European situation is deteriorating, all countries should jointly be responsible for maintaining the security of the Concessions. Therefore, he hopes that the British and Japanese sides can cooperate in general issues related to the Shanghai Concessions. In addition, Bowen denied that there was friction between the British and Japanese in the Shanghai Municipal Council, and that the Shanghai Municipal Council had no discriminatory treatment towards the Japanese police force. It is currently considering that in the future, when police officers are supplemented, Japanese with equal abilities will be recruited first. ""</p>
<h3>Japanese Spokesperson Denies; Demanding That the British and French Withdraw Their Troops</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 13th) afternoon, a Western reporter questioned the Japanese spokesperson at the Japanese news conference about whether they had received any reply from the British and French governments regarding the Japanese request for the withdrawal of troops stationed in China. The spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy claimed that Japan had not formally made the above request to the British and French governments. The sleeping China has awakened.</p>
<h3>After the War Ends, China Will Benefit the Most</h3>
<p>By American Economist So-Tan</p>
<p>The mainland newspaper reports that Mr. Babson, a leading American economist who was the first to predict the financial chaos of 1929, arrived in Shanghai last night (the 12th) aboard the Coolidge, bound for Manila. He stayed in Shanghai for only two hours, during which his friends in Shanghai hosted a Chinese banquet. This reporter met him at the dinner. According to Mr. Babson, Shanghai will become a world financial center in forty years. Mr. Babson is quite concerned about China's future. He said that while the current war in China is lamentable,</p>
<h3>The End of the War</h3>
<p>will benefit everyone, especially the Chinese people, because they will have awakened from a long-standing state of lethargy. The war has had a beneficial result, which is evident in the westward development of China. This is a phenomenon brought about by the war. Mr. Babson also said that if the</p>
<p>Current European War</p>
<p>does not end within three months, it will last at least three years. The American Republican and Democratic parties will use the slogan "We will keep America out of the war" as the basis for the 1940 presidential campaign. However, in Mr. Babson's opinion, no matter which party is elected, it will inevitably have to join England and France in the war. Today, the economic interests that the United States maintains in Europe are less than in 1914. On the other hand, Germany is now</p>
<p>More Able to Endure</p>
<p>than in the last war. The reason for this is that Germany and the Soviet Union have a trade agreement, which allows them to exchange machinery for raw materials, control trade in the Baltic Sea, and engage in foreign trade through neutral Italy. Mr. Babson also spoke about the Far Eastern situation, declaring that he believes China's closed-door policy will not last long and that foreign trade will not be prohibited. The best way for the Japanese to profit from trade now is through foreign capital.</p>
<p>Printing and Dyeing Industry Raises Prices</p>
<p>In Shanghai, in addition to the old-fashioned indigo dyeing and silk dyeing industries, there are more than 60 mechanized chemical printing and dyeing factories and more than 30 yarn dyeing factories, all of which are within the scope of the mechanized weaving industry. They consume a large amount of dyes each year, more than half of which come from Europe and America. Foreign</p>
<p>Dye Businesses</p>
<p>in this city include companies such as the German company Defu Yangxing, the British company Downham Yang Alkali Company's British Dyestuff Corporation, the American company Hengxin Yangxing, and the Swiss company Pei Ya Yangxing. Domestically produced dyes account for very little, only the caustic soda from the Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant, the sulfuric acid from the Xiangmao Jiangsu Chemical Plant, the sodium sulfide from the Da Zhonghua and Anliang Plants, and a few</p>
<p>Plant Dyes</p>
<p>from the interior. Since the outbreak of war in Europe earlier this month, many capitalists, seeing the unexpected profits made by dye merchants during the last European war, have been hoarding as much as possible. Within two or three days, the inventory of goods in the warehouses of various foreign firms was swept clean, causing prices to skyrocket. Generally, chemical raw materials such as sulfuric acid and caustic soda (i.e., caustic soda) have risen by</p>
<p>Nearly Doubled</p>
<p>The prices of dyes vary greatly. Several outstanding goods have risen four or five times, and even the lowest priced goods have doubled. This is unprecedented in recent years. In this environment, the printing and dyeing industry in this city has had to raise prices to maintain its capital. It has already been</p>
<p>Decided to Implement</p>
<p>the following measures: The mercerized dyeing factories of the dyeing and weaving industry group will add 40% to the original 10% for mercerization, and 80% to the original 20% for colors (prices for non-fading colors will be negotiated separately). The percentage increase for bleaching is the same as for colors. Other groups are also considering similar measures.</p>
<h3>Maritime Blockade Makes Smuggling Difficult</h3>
<p>The Lianxing, one of the patrol boats of the Jianghai Customs that was seized by the Japanese, is now docked in the Huangpu River after being returned by the Japanese. Because the work of intercepting smuggling outside the port is currently extremely difficult. The Japanese had promised to return another patrol boat, the Yunxing, but it had not been returned as of yesterday. The news of the other seized ships is even more scarce.</p>
<h3>British Consulate Denies Handling Jewish Refugees Enlist in British Army</h3>
<p>The committee organized by the consulate is to investigate the identity of Jews</p>
<p>The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reports that the British consul recently told reporters that the report in a certain newspaper this morning was inaccurate. No committee has been formed to handle the issue of German and Austrian Jewish refugees wishing to enlist in the British army. The committee that is currently working is to assist the British Consul-General in investigating the identity of Jews who wish to do business with British companies. Because the British government does not want to treat many German and Austrian Jewish immigrants and Czechs who oppose the Nazis as "enemies." The purpose of the committee's investigation of immigrants' identities is only for trade. As for British military regulations, they still prohibit the recruitment of non-British people.</p>

<h3>Former Philippine Governor-General Forbes' Second Rice Bowl Declaration</h3>
<p>All Proceeds Donated to Chinese Refugees Leaders from All Sectors in America Participate in Leadership</p>
<p>Colonel Forbes, chairman of the American United Relief for Chinese Refugees, will hold a second "Rice Bowl" campaign from October 30th to November 5th to raise funds from Americans to relieve Chinese disaster victims. The main points of Colonel Forbes' declaration are excerpted below:</p>
<p>One Thousand Cities Hold Jointly</p>
<p>Mr. Luo stated that this federation is scheduled to hold a second "Rice Bowl" campaign from October 30th to November 5th in one thousand cities in the United States to raise donations to purchase food and medicine to relieve women and children refugees affected by war, famine, and floods. The first "Rice Bowl" campaign held by this federation last year was very successful, hence the holding of this year's second campaign. However, this time we should make extra efforts to raise donations in the hope that the amount raised will increase, because in the third year of a non-declared state of war, the needs of the general refugees are even more urgent.</p>
<p>Terrible Shortage of Medicine, Clothing, and Food</p>
<p>Most newspapers focus on publishing war news, and do not fully report the dire suffering of millions of Chinese refugees and the reality of their need for clothing, food, and medicine. Although the Chinese government, churches, and relief organizations have tried their best to provide relief, the medicine, clothing, and food needed by the refugees are still in great shortage. This terrible shortage has been clearly pointed out in the news from China. This association is appealing to the American people on behalf of the disaster victims of a peace-loving and friendly nation, hoping for enthusiastic and generous assistance. Many countries have been aided by the United States, such as the disaster victims of the Japanese earthquake, the refugees of the Spanish Civil War, and the expelled Jews of Germany, all of whom have benefited from it.</p>
<p>Sharing the Sweet Dew of Benevolent Donations</p>
<p>Such donations come from goodwill and should also be received. However, the people in China who are affected by the disaster that this association is appealing to for relief should also share the sweet dew. All the proceeds from this "Rice Bowl" campaign will be used for Chinese refugees. The operating expenses of this association are not paid from the donations. Leaders of American industrialists, radio stations, stage, film, and outstanding social figures are willing to participate in leading this campaign. This list will be announced soon, and further news will be reported later.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai Continuously Inland Areas Have Also Been Opened</h3>
<p>Over 9,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived in the Past Two Days Inland Areas Have Already Been Opened with Japanese Notices</p>
<p>Notice of Price Stabilization Dates to Be Issued</p>
<p>After the price of domestic rice soared, Yu Qiaqing and others, in order to maintain the people's food supply, initiated a group purchase of foreign rice for price stabilization, and obtained approval from the Ministry of Finance for a foreign exchange of £10,000, thus ordering more than 18,000 bags of Saigon rice, which were shipped to Shanghai and arrived on the 7th, docked at the Bund Wharf on Beijing Road, and have been unloaded. It is now known that the Yihua Yangxing and Hesheng transports, which imported from Hong Kong, brought more than 4,000 bags of foreign rice on the previous day (the 10th). Yesterday, the Jinan transport of Taikoo Company also arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, bringing more than 5,000 bags of foreign rice, which have been unloaded separately. It is said that there will be more shipments arriving later. However, although foreign rice is arriving continuously, the price of rice in this city has not yet fallen.</p>
<p>Rice Stockpile Increases by More Than 10,000 Shi</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council negotiated with the Japanese to open up the source of rice, the amount of rice shipped to Shanghai from various places has been increasing daily. Because supply exceeds demand, the number of rice stored in warehouses has also increased proportionally. The Bean and Rice Industry Guild conducts a survey of rice stocks every week, which is held every Monday. The total amount of rice stored in various foreign warehouses this week has increased by more than 10,000 bags compared to last week.</p>
<p>District Price Stabilization Purchase to Be Implemented This Week</p>
<p>After the first batch of 18,000 bags of foreign rice was shipped to Shanghai, 10,000 bags were distributed by the Refugee Relief Association to various refugee shelters as food for the refugees. The remaining 8,000 bags will be sold at stable prices to maintain the livelihood of the common people. After a meeting of the Rice Merchants Guild, it was decided to hold the sale in five districts, and workers were hired to build reed sheds on open spaces on North Henan Road, Carter Road, etc., as places for price stabilization. It is now known that this project was completed yesterday. According to a person in charge of the Rice Merchants Guild, the date for price stabilization is scheduled for this Saturday and a notice will be issued. Otherwise, it may be realized next Monday.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Order Registration Continues</p>
<p>After Qing Qiaqing and others initiated the Food Maintenance Association to advocate ordering foreign rice to stabilize rice prices, various factories and groups entrusted the Accountant Association on the fourth floor of the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association Building to handle the registration procedures from the 25th of last month. By the 10th of this month, it had reached more than 10,000 bags. The initiators have decided to place the order first because the quantity to be ordered is sufficient, and request that the groups that have already obtained the forms fill them out immediately. As of yesterday, there were a total of more than 60 companies, with more than 11,000 bags. However, because some groups requested a postponement of the deadline, the association decided to continue handling the registration. As for the first meeting of orderers, they will be directly notified to participate after the initiators have made a decision.</p>
<p>Abundant Supply Leads to Price Weakness</p>
<p>Yesterday, 4,877 bags of rice were listed on the rice market, including 228 bags of japonica rice and the rest were indica rice. As for the market price, indica rice was quoted one yuan higher in the morning market, but fell back one yuan in the evening market. The best was sold for 35.5 yuan. Hong Kong glutinous rice dumplings were sold for 34 yuan, and local glutinous rice was sold for 33 to 34 yuan. Japonica rice was less available, so the price was more stable, with special grades opening at over 40 yuan. However, this price cannot be used as an official market price because only a few bags were traded. In general, the prices of various items will continue to fall, which is due to the abundant supply.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain in Production Areas Have Been Opened</p>
<p>According to a probe by a reporter from Da Guang, the new rice from the late-season rice harvest in the rice-producing areas of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui will soon be available. It is expected that all of the latest late-season rice will be available within two months. This year, due to the favorable weather conditions, the harvest is no less than in previous years. After the rice and grain from various places were illegally blocked by the Japanese puppets, the farmers and merchants in the inland areas were in distress, and the situation became increasingly uneasy. As the new rice is about to be available, merchants from various places have protested severely to the Japanese puppet "authorities." As a result, the Japanese have posted "notices" in various counties such as Wuxi, Changshu, Suzhou, and Kunshan, allowing merchants to freely trade and transport. However, the taxes are extremely heavy, and the general rice merchants still cannot afford it.</p>
<h3>Huangpu River Rises Can Avoid Overflowing</h3>
<p>Still Need to Guard Against in Case of Wind and Rain</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, due to the moon's proximity to the earth, a sudden high tide occurred, with a magnitude of 12 feet. Fortunately, the weather was clear and the tide did not reach the shore. There will be another high tide at zero hours this afternoon, with a magnitude of over 11 feet, so low-lying roads will still be flooded at that time, causing trouble for pedestrians. Also, from the 15th, there will be two tides every day in the Huangpu River, morning and afternoon, with a magnitude of about 12 feet. If there is wind and rain, the tide is likely to flood the shore, and it will not return to normal until the 20th.</p>
<h3>Reduced Import Tax Rates All Customs Offices Ordered to Implement</h3>
<p>Effective from September, Reduced by One-Third Until the End of the War</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance telegraphed the Inspector General of Customs, saying that since the beginning of the war of resistance two years ago, the people have endured hardships and sacrifices, which the government deeply appreciates. In order to make the necessities of life</p>
<p>Affordable</p>
<p>The Ministry has approved that from September 2nd of this year, all imported goods, except for the goods prohibited from import as listed in the Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods during the Emergency Period promulgated on July 1st, shall be levied with an import tax of one-third of the current tax rate.</p>
<p>Effective Period</p>
<p>Until the end of the war, in addition to sending telegrams separately, you are requested to comply with the regulations and publicize them to the public. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with the Inspector General of Customs yesterday and learned that all</p>
<p>Occupied Areas</p>
<p>Customs offices have been ordered to implement the regulations one after another. However, in the occupied areas such as Shanghai, it is feared that it will be difficult to comply with the regulations due to obstacles in implementation.</p>
<h3>Woman Electrocuted While Ironing Clothes</h3>
<p>Gu Tian, a woman from Ningbo (35 years old), lived at No. 1 of Maoxingfang on Haige Road. Yesterday at around 2:00 PM, while ironing clothes with an electric iron, she touched the electric current and fell to the ground. Her family members quickly rescued her, but she was unconscious and barely breathing. They immediately hired a car and rushed her to the hospital for treatment, fearing for her life.</p>
<h3>Coal Supply Uncertain Market in Chaos</h3>
<p>Coal Briquette Vouchers Now Controlled by Hoarders Navigation to Wenzhou Open Fuel Supply Not Expected to Be Lacking</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of war in Europe, foreign transportation has been blocked, and transportation is not without difficulties. After the source of domestic coal to Shanghai was cut off, coal merchants rushed to order coal from coal-producing areas such as Annam and India to transport it to Shanghai to make adjustments. However, due to high costs and tight foreign exchange, all coal prices have been rising steadily for the past year. Now, the authorities in various European countries have controlled coal exports, resulting in a sharp reduction in coal shipments to Shanghai recently. The coal market has no goods to meet the market, has suspended trading several times, and prices have risen to record highs. In addition, speculators are hoarding goods, people are bullish, and the order is quite chaotic.</p>
<p>Outbreak of European War Encourages People</p>
<p>According to news from the coal industry, the market situation tended to be clear in the previous week, and the exchange rate was relaxed and costs reduced, and the market originally had hopes of easing. However, the outbreak of the European war encouraged people, and the source of supply was uncertain, causing the market price of various coal blocks to soar. The estimated price of Haifeng No. 1, 2, and 3 coal blocks has reached over 100 yuan, Hebei screened coal is about 90 yuan, and the stockpile of Hongji coal is not large, the market supply and demand are very different. Currently, there are no goods arriving in Shanghai, forming a market with no transactions, and black market trading is rampant, and top-grade small coal is even more scarce. However, coal merchants are taking the opportunity to be active, hoarding goods, and waiting for a good price to sell. It is reported that the current coal in Shanghai is about 400,000 to 500,000 tons, mostly bituminous coal. Various industries and factories have suffered huge losses due to the rising prices of coal blocks, and are very anxious.</p>
<p>Coal Briquette Price Increases Due to Manipulation</p>
<p>The price of coal briquettes on the market has been increasing daily, with some selling for more than four yuan per load. This has not only disrupted the market but also harmed the livelihood of the common people. The Coal Briquette Industry Association agreed on the market price on September 3, with a wholesale price of 67 yuan per ton and a retail price of 3.7 yuan per load. It has not changed in the past ten days. Unexpectedly, black market trading has recently occurred on the market, with prices opening at 80 yuan per ton, and the retail prices of various coal shops are inconsistent, and the situation is extremely chaotic. The reason for this is that the factories have sold too many fixed-order vouchers in the past, and most of these vouchers have fallen into the hands of speculators who are hoarding goods and unwilling to release them, causing a panic of shortage of goods on the market. In order to seek relief, the association has convened a meeting of various factories to discuss and organize a price evaluation committee to formulate a solution to the issued vouchers, with the aim of stabilizing market prices and reducing the burden on citizens. According to the investigation, although the European war has started, the source of foreign coal has not been hindered. For example, Tongcheng Company's Guba filings, Hancheng Yangxing's Xinhong filings, and Yitaixing and Dalongxing's Hongmu filings have all arrived in Shanghai in large quantities. The raw materials are sufficient, and the factory's output can also be increased, so speculators cannot manipulate the market, and the market price will stabilize naturally.</p>
<p>Shen'ai Ship Loads Charcoal to Shanghai</p>
<p>The source of charcoal fuel in this city has always relied on supplies from Wenzhou and other places. Since the Shanghai-Oujiang route was cut off, the source was cut off, causing prices to gradually soar. However, the wholesale price of raw Wenzhou charcoal is only 3.6 yuan per load, but after being transferred to hoarders, the market price is as high as about 10 yuan per load, and the citizens are deeply distressed. It is now known that the trial voyage of Shanghai-Wenzhou was successful, and the first batch of charcoal loaded by the Shen'ai ship, more than 6,000 loads, may arrive in Shanghai around the 15th and 16th of this month. The other ships will also transport charcoal to Shanghai one after another, totaling more than 50,000 loads. From then on, the fuel problem in this port can be solved.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Areas Convert to Foreign Goods Ban on Transportation to Inland Areas</h3>
<p>Parcels Mailed Before the Ban Allowed to Be Imported After Verification</p>
<p>Measures for banning the import and transshipment of certain foreign goods have now been stipulated by the Ministry of Finance as follows: (1) Goods manufactured in guerrilla areas using banned foreign goods as raw materials are also subject to the ban. (2) If a postal parcel contains banned foreign goods or goods manufactured in guerrilla areas using banned foreign goods as raw materials, if the customs verifies that it was mailed abroad or in the guerrilla area before the import ban was implemented at the port of entry, it should be allowed to be imported immediately.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Passenger and Cargo Congestion Additional Ships Added</h3>
<p>Yilong and Taikoo Ships Resume Shanghai-Fujian Routes Navigation on the Oujiang River Still Running Smoothly After Opening</p>
<p>The flourishing transportation of cargo between Shanghai and Ningbo is all caused by the long shipping schedules. If the previous shipping schedule of one trip every other day were followed, there would be no such cargo traffic and passenger congestion. Therefore, the large number of passengers and cargo is all due to long-term accumulation. The Lihe Yangxing Moufu ship returned to Shanghai from Ningbo on the 9th of last month and sailed to Zhenhai again on the 16th. It was previously heard that it would return to Shanghai yesterday, but it had not been imported by the evening. The company has no definite news. According to the calculation of the return date of this ship, it has exceeded more than a month, and according to the departure date, it has been 29 days. It is heard that it will not be able to arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>Number of Shanghai-Ningbo Ships Increased to Nine</p>
<p>The Xin'anna ship, which has newly joined the shipping route, will be on her maiden voyage this morning, and the Ende ship of the company will be changed to depart at 4:00 PM today. The Haida ship has also joined the Shanghai-Ningbo route. After unloading the foreign rice yesterday, she will temporarily sail to the Yangshupu River and moor. She is scheduled to return to the Bund Wharf on Beijing Road on the 15th to load Ningbo cargo and depart for Zhenhaikou around the 16th or 17th. The number of ships currently sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo route has increased to nine.</p>
<p>British Company Resumes Shanghai-Fujian Route</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Fuzhou route has been suspended for a long time. Now the British Yilong Company has designated the Shenhua ship to load cargo and passengers in Shanghai this morning and sail directly to Fuzhou. She will anchor at Mawei outside the Minjiang River. She also plans to dispatch ships to resume the route with Quanzhou. It is heard that the British Taikoo Company will also dispatch ships to operate the Shanghai-Fujian route.</p>
<p>Dispatch Ships to Operate Shanghai-Wenzhou</p>
<p>After the Shanghai-Wenzhou route was successfully trialed, the Xinxiangtai ship of the British company, which is represented by the Taichang Yangxing, sailed directly from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the 10th. A telegram was received yesterday morning that it had arrived safely at the Wenzhou wharf at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Also, the Shenfu ship of the British Yilong Company loaded cargo in Shanghai yesterday and sailed directly to Wenzhou. The Shen'ai ship is currently docked in Wenzhou to load cargo.</p>
<h3>German Nationals Still Moving Public Concession</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the German Rickmers Line Shipping Company, located at No. 9 Edward Road, is now said to be moving to No. 620 Fourth Road in the Public Concession today (the 14th) after receiving friendly advice. The company's ships</p>
<p>Before the Outbreak of the European War</p>
<p>regularly sailed between Germany and the Far East. Since the outbreak of the war, most of the ships have been docked in the port of Hamburg, with one avoiding to Japan and one still in Wusong. Also, in the past few days, French small shops and</p>
<p>German Nationals</p>
<p>moving into the Public Concession in the French Concession have been very crowded, causing the hotels and apartments in the Public Concession to be full. However, Rickmers is the first of the large commercial firms to relocate. The Shanghai Nazi People's Relief Association and the German Women's Association have recently</p>
<p>Formed an Inquiry Office</p>
<p>located at No. 226 Nanjing Road to help German nationals who have relocated locally and German nationals who have come to Shanghai from other places to find housing and exchange information.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Domestic Goods Industry Plans to Establish a Joint Issuing House</h3>
<p>The Shanghai domestic goods industry believes that the outbreak of the European War will reduce the number of imported goods coming to Shanghai, which is a good opportunity for the development of the domestic goods business. Therefore, they have jointly planned to establish a joint issuing house for domestic goods manufacturers. They have selected Nos. 356 to 358 Nanjing Road as the site, which is being renovated and arranged. Lin Kanghou has been appointed as the chairman of the preparatory committee, and Liu Junlin, Zheng Dongshan, Chen Yongfang, etc. have been appointed as the directors of the preparatory office, which is located in Hengmaoli, Tianjin Road. Registration of participating manufacturers will be handled from now on, but only domestic goods manufacturers who have passed the review of the association will be allowed to participate.</p>
<h3>Central Shanghai Bank Telegraphed Request to Issue Subsidiary Coin Vouchers</h3>
<p>All Sectors Request Early Issuance to Facilitate Circulation While Relieving Jiangsu Merchants' Difficulties</p>
<p>The Central Bank has been approved by the Ministry of Finance to issue one-cent and five-cent subsidiary coin vouchers, which have been printed by the American Yongning Company. It was originally intended to be issued as soon as possible, but the issuance was temporarily postponed due to the discovery of sample prints on the market. The head office of the bank has instructed the Hong Kong office to make serious representations to the company that printed the vouchers. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with banking circles yesterday and learned that the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, in response to requests from all sectors, is looking forward to the early issuance of subsidiary coin vouchers to facilitate circulation and relieve the difficulties of Jiangsu merchants. It is heard that it has telegraphed the head office again, requesting that the printed subsidiary coin vouchers be stamped and circulated, and that other appropriate measures be taken.</p>

<h3>Gamblers Repeatedly Lost Large Sums Sent Letter to Gambling Den Demanding Explanation Den Owner Sent Five People to Reply Could Not Find Chen by Surname at Dafa Hotel Japanese and Korean Handed Over to Japanese Police Chinese Arrested by Police</h3>
<p>The "Zi Lin Daily" reported that yesterday (the 20th) just after 7:30 PM, one Japanese, one Korean, and three Chinese entered the Zhengjia Wooden Bridge Wei Dafa Hotel and asked in which room a Mr. Chen (traveling accent) was staying. The hotel manager was behind the counter and searched the guest list, but there was no one with the surname Chen. At the same time, he recognized one of the five people as a Japanese. Not wanting to cause trouble, he telephoned the police station to report it. A squad of police officers arrived a few minutes later, equipped with a</p>
<p>Japanese Translator</p>
<p>who questioned them. According to the five people, Mr. Chen lost a large sum in a certain gambling den ("歹土") and sent a letter to the den owner demanding an explanation for his large loss, leaving the Dafa Hotel as his address. The five people were sent by the den owner to explain to Mr. Chen. Mr. Chen seems to be a frequent gambler at the den. In recent weeks, he lost a large sum and returned home.</p>
<p>Sent a Letter to the Den</p>
<p>owner demanding an explanation and said that he could go to the Dafa Hotel at 7:30 PM last night to compensate him. Only he himself knows the reason why he demanded an "explanation." The den owner undoubtedly did not want to leave "歹土", so he sent five people to "explain" to his gambling customer. The detectives investigating the case heard what the five people said, which seemed quite strange, so they notified the police department of the Japanese Consulate. A few minutes later,</p>
<p>Japanese Police Arrived</p>
<p>and questioned the five people separately, learning that what the five people said was completely true and finding that none of the five people were carrying weapons. The Japanese consulate police took the Japanese and Korean away, and the other three Chinese were taken to the Maitland Police Station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Dysentery Outbreak Unprecedented in Recent Years</h3>
<p>This year's dysentery epidemic in this city is very rampant, which is rare in recent years. According to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital yesterday, in the past three days, the hospital's outpatient department has discovered 218 more dysentery patients. According to Mr. Deng Qingshan, the director of the hospital's medical affairs department, the source of dysentery is caused by careless diet and is transmitted quite quickly. Therefore, residents should not drink unboiled water, eat raw or cold food, and especially avoid contact with patients in order to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>
<h3>Husband and Wife Quarrel; Wife Hangs Herself</h3>
<p>Shen Zhongyi from Pinghu, around thirty years old this year, and his wife Shen Peiying, thirty years old this year, lived in the attic of the Tongfeng Coal Shop at No. 203 Xiafei Road in the French Concession. On the 12th, around noon, the couple suddenly started arguing and fighting, eventually wrestling each other to the Xiafei Police Station. After questioning by the detective, Shen Zhongyi was detained for assaulting his wife, while Shen Peiying was released and sent home. Yesterday, at 11:00 AM, Shen Peiying returned home from the police station and had another argument with her husband. Afterwards, he left. After her husband left, Shen Peiying was overwhelmed with emotions and became suicidal. She hung herself with a rope on the bed frame in the room. At 1:00 PM, the second landlord, Shen Cao, discovered it and called neighbors to help, but she had already stopped breathing. The French Concession police were notified and sent her to Guangci Hospital, but it was too late to save her. After examining the body and finding that her husband was missing, the body was collected and buried by the charity hall.</p>
<h3>Honest Advice is Hard to Swallow; Assaulting a Mistress; Reconciliation Out of Consideration for Past Affection Leads to Case Dismissal</h3>
<p>Zhao Yangchun, a Suzhou native residing at No. 672 Baike Road, had been living with a young woman named Yao. Their relationship was harmonious and they appeared to be a loving couple. However, Zhao had a gambling addiction and spent almost the entire day gambling. Zhao Yao repeatedly advised him against gambling, pointing out that it not only cost them money but also wasted time and neglected their responsibilities. However, Zhao did not listen to her advice, leading to frequent arguments in recent times. On the afternoon of the 30th of last month, she again advised him not to go gambling, which angered Zhao. He suddenly became violent and assaulted her. She was injured and immediately reported it to the Xin Zha Police Station, which sent detectives to take the injured woman to the hospital for treatment. At the same time, a lawsuit was filed against Zhao Yangchun for assault. The case was heard yesterday by the First Special District Local Court. Because the injuries Zhao Yao had sustained had already healed, and because she was also mindful of their long-term cohabitation, she did not want to let such a minor matter ruin their relationship. After questioning in court, since both parties had reached an understanding, the court ruled that the case would not be accepted.</p>
<h3>National Doctor Qi Linsheng Found Not Guilty of Rape</h3>
<p>Chen Wang, a Suzhou woman residing at No. 1 Wufeng Lane, at the intersection of Lafei Road and Luban Road, previously hired lawyer He Yongsheng to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court. She accused Qi Linsheng, a Henan native and national doctor working at Yongyu Lane, Lafeide Road, of enticing her nineteen-year-old daughter Chen Sanken to leave home and hiding and raping her on October 7th of last year. After interrogation by Judge Sun Penghuan, Qi was found not guilty.</p>
<h3>Owner of Heji Sand and Gravel Company Pelted with Feces; Three Arrested, Released on Bail Pending Further Investigation</h3>
<p>Ying Zongqi, a Ningbo native and owner of the Yuji Yellow Sand and Gravel Company at No. 24, No. 191 Beijing Road (nicknamed "Little Ningbo," residing at No. 5 Yongle Lane, Kai Zi Road), was walking down from the sand and gravel industry tea party at the Changle Tea House, No. 500 Fuzhou Road, at 5:50 PM on the 11th of this month, and was about to get into his private car when several people suddenly stepped forward and blocked the car. One of them threw an iron can full of fecal matter at Ying, covering his face and head with the yellow and white substance. At the same time, another person stepped forward and snatched the 1,990 yuan in legal tender that Ying was holding. At that moment, Chinese police officer No. 3423, who was on duty nearby, heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, and the rioters scattered and fled. The legal tender that had been snatched was scattered on the ground and was not lost. Afterwards, Ying reported the incident to the Lao Zha Police Station, saying that he recognized the perpetrators as Fang Changgen, Wu Aji, Cao Gengui, Shi Jinsheng, Shang Aming, and others, all Ningbo natives engaged in the yellow sand and gravel business at No. 405 Dajin Road and No. 536 Sichuan Road. The reason for the attack was competition in the same industry and a failure to obtain a loan. Detective Zhang Keqin went to the Changle Tea House on the 12th and arrested Fang, Wu, and Cao. The other two, Shi Jinsheng and Shang Aming, were still at large. Yesterday, they were brought to the Criminal Court 4 of the Special First Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu charged them with violent coercion and public humiliation, requesting that they be punished according to the law. He also requested an extension to investigate the accomplices. Ying Zongqi and his partner Xia Hexin, as well as the car driver Liang Yonghu, separately identified the three defendants as being present at the scene. After questioning by Judge Fang Qinghuan, he ordered a postponement for further questioning and granted bail of 500 yuan or a guarantee letter for each defendant, who were released pending further investigation. The lawyers for the defendants were Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, and Wu Linkun.</p>
<h3>Gang of Robbers Caught</h3>
<p>The Central Police Station of the Public Concession recently arrested twenty-four men and women, including suspects in robbery cases Fan Zhengchu (also known as Fan Shizhang), Wang Rongsheng, and Wang Xueyao, at Zhenhua and Jiahe hotels. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Special Criminal Court for detention. Based on their confessions, the police arrested another accomplice, Huang Yun, the night before last.

<h3>Old Man Commits Assault with a Knife</h3>
<p>Zhou Zhenfang (23 years old) from Jiangbei, who had been running a noddle stall downstairs at the Haifang Tea House at No. 424 Haifang Road, employed a helper named Zhou Xuesheng. Yesterday morning, around 5:00 AM, Yu Chengqing (57 years old), a resident of the same address from Huai'an, suddenly attacked both Zhou with a cleaver, inflicting serious injuries. Afterwards, they were taken to the hospital for treatment. Yu was arrested at the scene. It is reported that the reason for the attack was that Yu's daughter-in-law had been having an affair with Zhou Zhenfang's brother, Zhenxiang. Yu found out about it and was furious, forbidding his daughter-in-law from going downstairs. Zhenxiang then ordered his younger brother to take advantage of opportunities to communicate with her. However, the scheme was discovered by Yu, so he attacked Zhou Zhenfang with a knife. Zhou Xuesheng tried to dissuade him, but was also injured.</p>
<h3>Insulting a Young Girl Punished</h3>
<p>Huang Zhiying, a sixteen-year-old girl, was walking alone near No. 195 Lane, Maigen Road, at around 6:30 AM the day before yesterday. It was just dawn and there were few pedestrians. Two young men, Guo Jinfu (from Ningbo) and Zhu Jianfu (from Wangbei), stopped her, made fun of her, and insulted her in various ways. A nearby police officer heard her cries for help and rushed to the scene, arresting Guo and Zhu and sending them to the First Special Court. Because the case concerned public morals, the hearing was closed to the public. As a result, Judge Zai sentenced both defendants to punishment for public indecency.</p>
<h3>Countless Problems with Vouchers; Counterfeit Vouchers Continue to be Discovered; Case of 50,000 Counterfeit Vouchers at Heji Company Uncovered, Three Arrested, Witnesses Summoned for Further Investigation</h3>
<p>Heji Company, an organization formed by fourteen stores including the Jingan Paper Store at No. 1921 Jingan Temple Road, issued one- and two-cent vouchers, redeemable for goods, with a total of 480,000 vouchers printed, worth more than 7,000 yuan. Since the implementation of the vouchers on July 3rd, which lasted for two months, it had been going smoothly. However, on the 3rd of this month, it was discovered that counterfeit vouchers of the same type were being used fraudulently in the market. The police of the Huishi Police Station arrested three suspects, Qiu Xigen from Qingpu, Peng Ruixiang from Haimen, and Wang Yichen from Suzhou. 24,000 counterfeit one- and two-cent vouchers were seized from the Haining Printing House, founded by Qiu Xigen at No. 1008 Haining Road. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng came to court for a continued interrogation. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that there was still one major offender at large. When questioned, Qiu confessed that he was asked by defendant Peng Ruixiang to print 50,000 vouchers, and he did not know they were for fraudulent purposes, pleading for leniency. However, the testimonies of Peng and Wang were evasive. Judge Huang ordered that they remain in custody and scheduled a further hearing with witnesses for investigation.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Murder Case; Trial Concluded, Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>Wang Arong and Shen Guilin, robbers from Hangzhou, together with Qian Dechang, who is still at large, used weapons to stop and rob Chai Yunlong and Cai Jingxiao, employees of the Hengbiao Woolen Goods Store on Tianjin Road, Xiangfen Lane, in front of No. 335 Sichuan Road at around 1:00 PM on the 29th of last month. They stole 6,000 yuan in cash and shot at Cai, intending to kill him but failed. Chinese police officers No. 1436 and 2566 arrested them, along with the stolen goods, and brought them to the police station for investigation. They were sent to the First Special Court for detention. Yesterday morning, the case was filed with public prosecution on charges of robbery and attempted murder. Judge Qian presided over the trial in Criminal Court 1. Defendant Wang Arong testified that the pistol was borrowed by Shen Guirong from Pudong, and that Qian Dechang, who is still at large, was the instigator. He claimed that they did not know that Chai Yunlong was carrying a large sum of money, and that Qian Dechang found out about it and asked them to rob him. During the robbery, Cai was injured because he resisted. The court reviewed the testimony and ordered the defendants to remain in custody pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Fuli Road; Gunfire as a Show of Force Upon Departure</h3>
<p>At 11:00 PM on the night before last (the 12th), five bandits, three of whom were armed, broke into the home of Guan Peirong, a resident of Sunjiabang on Fuli Road. They robbed 170 yuan in cash. As the bandits were leaving, they fired two shots into the air as a show of force.</p>
<h3>Severe Flooding in Tianjin; Ninety Percent of Residents Affected; 600,000 People Homeless</h3>
<p>Sun Shengying, Honorary Chairman of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Society, sent a letter from Tianjin, detailing the severity of the flooding situation. No less than ninety percent of the residents have been affected, and 600,000 people are homeless. Currently, relief efforts are divided into four areas: the British and French Concessions, the Japanese Concession, and the city area, each operating independently. However, there is not enough strength, mainly due to a lack of funds to purchase food, clothing, and medicine. Medicine is especially important, as it is essential to prevent the spread of the currently rampant epidemic. The victims in areas outside Tianjin are even more pitiful. Farmers have a small amount of leftover seeds, but they will soon run out. If they are unable to sow seeds in the future, all the land will become barren. In addition, the weather is getting colder, and people lack clothing to get through the winter. Starved and frozen, how can they prolong their lives? Currently, prices in Tianjin are expensive, having increased by 60 percent, making relief efforts even more difficult. The society remitted 20,000 yuan to Tianjin a few days ago, but this is only a temporary measure. What is urgently needed is generous donations from all sectors of society, sent to the Chinese and Foreign Relief Society at No. 97 Renji Road, to provide widespread relief. The committee is managed by Mr. Han Ji, manager of HSBC; Mr. McKay, manager of Citibank; and Mr. Zhi Songsun, manager of the Bank of China (acting with Mr. Jing Lanshi), and Mr. Yan Chengde, manager of China United Trust Company.</p>
<h3>Zhang Guangyu Family Hall; Lawsuit over Ancestral Property Lease; Defendant Found Not Guilty of Defamation; Judgment on Invalid Lease Scheduled</h3>
<p>At the end of Tushanwan Yude Road, Xujiahui, Shanghai, there is an ancestral graveyard of the Zhang family, shared by the descendants of the first, second, and third branches of the Catholic Zhang Guangyu Family Hall, covering an area of approximately twenty mu. Recently, Zhang Yucang, who teaches at Aurora University and belongs to the first branch of the family, leased approximately five mu of the remaining land near the graveyard in the name of Guangyu Family Hall to</p>
<h3>Renyu Dyeing and Weaving</h3>
<p>to build a dyeing and weaving factory, with a lease term of fifteen years and an annual rent of 2,250 yuan. Upon learning of this, his nephews Zhang Guanghe and other family members Zhang Yunlong, Baolu, Haihe, Mingqian, Zhidan, Tifu, and Youqin jointly hired lawyer Tang Yingsong to publish a notice opposing the lease. They also jointly hired lawyer Zhu Yisheng to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Special Second Court against Zhang Yucang and Tan Xingbo of Renyu Dyeing and Weaving Factory, seeking confirmation that the</p>
<h3>Lease Contract is Invalid</h3>
<p>After seeing the newspaper announcement, Zhang Yucang filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, accusing lawyer Tang Yingsong and Zhang Guanghe, Zhang Yunlong, Baolu, Haihe, Mingqian, Zhidan, Tifu, and Youqin of defamation, requesting that they be investigated according to the law, stating that the first defendant, representing the other defendants, published an announcement on the 28th of last month accusing the plaintiff of privately engraving the Guangyu Family Hall seal and privately leasing the land to Renyu Dyeing and Weaving Factory, violating Article 828 of the Civil Code, etc., constituting defamation. Judge Zhu Chuzhe opened a court session and</p>
<h3>Summoned Both Parties for Trial</h3>
<p>As a result, he found that the</p>
<p>defendants' publication did not constitute a crime, as the dispute between the parties was over the leasing of land and was being litigated in court. Yesterday, he ruled that Tang Yingsong, Zhang Guanghe, Yunlong, Baolu, Haiqiao, Mingqian, Zhidan, Tifu, and Youqin were all not guilty. As for the civil case, Judge Yu Changzi held a hearing on the 6th of this month and ordered a postponement. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu continued the hearing. Both parties were represented by lawyers. First,</p>
<h3>A Descendant of the Third Branch of the Zhang Family</h3>
<p>Zhang Jinfan, stated that he had filed a request to join the lawsuit, arguing that the defendant should not have leased out the ancestral graveyard land without authorization, and requested a ruling confirming that the lease contract was invalid. The court asked the plaintiff's lawyer, who had no objection to Zhang Jinfan's joining the lawsuit. After questioning the lawyers of both parties, the court ordered them to make their arguments and announced the conclusion of the hearing, scheduling the verdict for the 16th.</p>
<h3>Fire on North Shaanxi Road</h3>
<p>A fire suddenly broke out at the New Printing House at No. 3, Lane 568, North Shaanxi Road, in the Public Concession, at 5:30 AM yesterday. Due to the dry weather, the fire spread quickly and uncontrollably. The fire brigade was notified and rushed to the scene, and the fire was extinguished at around 7:00 AM. As a result, two neighboring houses were also burned down, causing significant losses. Because the residents were already awake when the fire broke out, there were no casualties.</p>
<h3>Swallows Diamond Ring to Commit Suicide</h3>
<p>Wang Fusheng, a 20-year-old from Zhenjiang, residing at No. 15, Lingdui Yufang, Huacheng Road, Nanyang Bridge, in the French Concession, had an argument with his wife yesterday morning around 9:00 AM over family matters.

<h3>YMCA Funds Further Education; 183 Approved</h3>
<p>The Student Department of the YMCA and the Student Department of the YWCA, due to the fact that many middle school and university students have been forced to discontinue their studies in the aftermath of the war, have jointly organized a student relief committee to consider the situation and subsidize tuition fees, living expenses, and travel expenses, so that they can continue their studies and not waste their talents. Since the registration deadline, a total of more than 700 high school and university students have applied.

They were originally scheduled to gather in Hong Kong after (16th) to take the British Steamship Company's mail ship to go abroad. Due to the outbreak of the European War, the hired mail ship has been requisitioned for military use, so there are problems with the ship.

<h3>Word Meaning and Composition</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ren</p>
<p>Even now, some conservatives are worrying about young people, saying that writing in colloquial style is more difficult than writing in classical Chinese, because many word meanings in colloquial style come from classical Chinese, just as French evolved from Latin. Therefore, only by truly understanding classical Chinese can one avoid making mistakes when writing in colloquial style. The practical application of this theory is that Chinese teachers ask students to read classical texts and write classical essays.</p>
<p>In fact, this theory is based on Mr. Zhang Taiyan's ideas. However, Mr. Taiyan's argument is even more thorough. He said: most of today's colloquial language is ancient language, and most of today's characters are ancient characters. If you don't understand "Xiaoxue" (Etymology), you will definitely make a complete mess when writing in vernacular Chinese. Today's conservatives have only modified it a little.</p>
<p>However, no matter how you put it, this theory is ridiculous. If one studies ancient texts to "understand" language and characters, or even to understand "Xiaoxue," that's fine. But conservatives insist that it's for practical application. That's where the problem lies.</p>
<p>It is a fact that each generation's language is transformed from the language of the previous generation, and no one can deny it. But the reason for the transformation is because of this need. Naturally, some word meanings are the same as in the previous generation, but those word meanings can remain because modern people can still understand them. As long as you understand, you can naturally use them. It is unnecessary to bother tracing those roots, which is simply meddling. Because once you start tracing, you will inevitably go further and further. The most thorough result is that all commonly used loan characters cannot be used. As soon as you start writing, you must first think about what the original meaning of each character is, which will inevitably make you nervous, and modern articles cannot be written.</p>
<p>There is only one purpose for writing: to convey one's thoughts to modern people. And reading articles is also just to see your thoughts, and incidentally to see if you have conveyed your thoughts at all. Authors do not write for the sake of word meanings, and readers do not read for the sake of word meanings. Therefore, even if you "understand" all the word meanings in classical Chinese, it is irrelevant to writing modern articles. Even if you completely "understand" that a certain character is "pictographic," a certain character is "ideographic," and a certain character is "phonetic loan," it is also irrelevant to writing modern articles. Asking young people to first learn classical Chinese thoroughly, or even memorize the "Shuowen Jiezi" (Etymological Dictionary of Chinese Characters), before starting to write modern articles is naturally good for classical scholars and etymologists, as everyone has something to eat, but young people themselves will be deceived and have no chance to succeed.</p>
<p>Comparing ancient Chinese to Latin is not really accurate. But even with Latin, in France and other countries with related languages, it is not generally understood. Latin is only an elective subject in schools, and if you ask a French person or someone from another country, they will always say that Latin is difficult, and never say that their modern national language is more difficult than Latin. French also has ancient texts, which can be compared to ancient Chinese, but that kind of writing has long become an antique, and the works have all been translated into modern French.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, if these Chinese characters still exist one day, we will always use these conventionally used loan characters, and "miswritten characters" will increase, which is the so-called transformation, and the distance from the original meaning of the characters will become greater day by day. Although conservatives can temporarily suppress young people, their efforts will ultimately be in vain.</p>
<p>However, I am not opposed to people understanding ancient texts and mastering "Xiaoxue." I am just saying that it is a matter for experts, not for every young person who wants to be able to write in the national language. Experts can "understand" more deeply and "master" more thoroughly, and be able to write inscriptions on bronze vessels and oracle bones, but they have absolutely no right to ask others to learn from them. Moreover, even experts, if they want to publish their research results, must write them in modern writing. Mr. Taiyan used ancient characters to write articles throughout his life, but he could not completely use them, and he was still using loan characters. Only Mr. Qian Xuantong once copied Taiyan's "Xiaoxue Dawen" (Questions and Answers on Etymology) using "Shuowen" characters, but it seems that only he himself and Taiyan were the readers.</p>
<p>These are actually common sense. But the reason why I finally say this without avoiding superficiality is because the conservatives' theory is too far from common sense.</p>
<h3>The "Maginot" Line of Belgium</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>In recent years, European countries have spared no effort in preparing for war and have built defensive lines on their borders. Although Belgium has declared that it will remain neutral in future European wars, it has still built defensive lines on its borders. These defensive lines are built opposite Germany's Siegfried Line, connecting to France's Maginot Line in the south and the Netherlands' fortifications in the north.</p>
<p>Its organization can be divided into two sections: (1) the Waterline (in the north) and (2) the Fortress Line (in the south).</p>
<p>The function of the Waterline is to use the special conditions of the land to flood the area at any time to effectively prevent the enemy from penetrating. This line runs from Liege to the Dutch border and is composed of the Meuse River between Belgium and the Netherlands and several canals: the Jueian Canal, the Aebert Canal, and a so-called connecting river. The largest project among them is the Albert Canal: in May 1933, King Albert of Belgium began to excavate the first section of this canal, from Liege to Hasselt. Two years later, King Leopold and Queen Astrid excavated the second section from Anvers to Hereuthals. The third section was initiated by the current King of Belgium and was completed a few months ago under the protection of the British and French fleets. This river is 122 kilometers long from Liege to Anvers and has six locks. If necessary, the locks can be opened to repeat the Yser River incident. (Note: In 1914, the Yser River lock manager opened a large amount of river water to prevent the German army from advancing.)</p>
<p>The Fortress Line was almost built at the same time as the French Maginot Line. However, due to the need to maintain secrecy, many people still do not know about this solid line of defense.</p>
<p>The plan to build this Fortress Line was decided after many fierce debates. Some people advocated building a very deep network of cement trenches in accordance with the previous effective strategy of resisting tanks. However, others believed that such fortifications were insufficient to defend against the ever-changing tactics of modern warfare, and they strongly supported the plan adopted by France: to build a continuous series of fortifications, equipped with underground bomb shelters and the latest weapons. As a result, they used a mixed approach of the above two plans, mixed with the defense methods used by Germany before the last World War in the Metz architectural flower-shaped line (grands festons).</p>
<p>From Longwy to Liege, this undulating forest plateau was originally a reliable natural barrier line, so it was only necessary to build considerable fortifications to cut off bridges and key points, install hidden gun emplacements to control roads, and place many landmines to make it sufficient for defense. Now Liege's old castle has been transformed into a new style, but the real Belgian Maginot Line joins the Meuse River on the Dutch border 15 miles east of the city. As for the areas that can be attacked by tanks, they have long been equipped with a large number of obstacles. The foremost are landmines, behind the landmines are fences, and behind them are long rows of wide barbed wire. In addition, there are many tank traps scattered everywhere. All of the above are set within the range of automatic weapons and armored artillery. Countless tunnels are dug deep in the land to connect the caves where the firing devices, air pipes, and exits are installed.</p>
<p>The underground equipment has electrical equipment for ventilation, heating, and lighting, as well as elevators, armories, supply depots, food storage rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, and infirmaries. Some tunnels are even 100 meters below the ground. (Abridged translation from the Paris Illustration)</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts by the Window</h3>
<p>— Xu Ye</p>
<p>Bridgehead</p>
<p>Now, I miss the bridgehead of my hometown.</p>
<p>I have seen a flock of autumn geese skim across the long sky, and the idle clouds in the field weave into a pleasing picture. In the stream that is constantly sounding, the familiar sound of the boatman rowing comes.</p>
<p>Under this bridge, a few boats rushing to the early market are gathered.</p>
<p>"Hum--yo!"</p>
<p>A stirring echo reverberates in the silent riverside.</p>
<p>With a quiet and refined bridgehead, I like to walk there alone and look at the vast clouds and sky.</p>
<p>"Morning! Came so early today?"</p>
<p>Because I often go to the bridgehead, the old villager who scoops duckweed by the stream is used to asking me with a smile.</p>
<p>"How about you? Is business good?"</p>
<p>"Well! In these years—how can things be good."</p>
<p>Hearing a deep sigh, the water surface slammed, as if the fish in the stream jumped onto the shore.</p>
<p>Since then, the old man's words have been interrupted.</p>
<p>I remember a long day when I went to teach in the city and always walked to the bridgehead when I came back on vacation. I still saw the old man sitting by the stream, silently watching the duckweed drifting with the water.</p>
<p>"Long time no see! Morning."</p>
<p>This has become his catchphrase. He always says "Morning," even though the time I see him is not morning but dusk.</p>
<p>Late at night, I quietly dragged my shadow to the bridgehead again. The old man by the stream was gone. I looked at the autumn night sky, remotely listening to the village drum, and occasionally in the depths of the reeds I heard startling, sharp sounds.</p>
<p>"Is it the cry of a goose?" I seemed to be moved.</p>
<p>The moon is round and the pure white light shines on the sleeping village. There is no commotion on the riverside. Only the chirping of crickets accompanies the sound of the water, playing the nocturne. A light breeze blows through the willows on the opposite bank, and my hair also drifts like willow catkins. The shadow of the moon gradually moves into the water. The bright reflection pierces my eyes and my face. Looking closely, it looks more like a silver plate, a string of pearls, sometimes no different from the one in the sky. However, the wind stirs the calmness of the water, and the moon in the stream also transforms into a line of ripple-like halos, and then transforms into hundreds and thousands of points, scattered on the water surface.</p>
<p>"Squeak--" A sudden squeak, the leaves also fluttered.</p>
<p>Deeply, I scratched my hair and thought.</p>
<p>Now, I have not seen my hometown for a long time, nor have I seen the bridgehead and the old man who scoops duckweed, and I cannot hear the sound of the geese in the autumn night. However, no matter if it is separated by three or five years, with my remembrance, I long for the safety of the lovely bridgehead from afar.</p>
<p>I expect it to be healthy and stubbornly exist, standing on that riverside.</p>
<p>Poems</p>
<p>The sanxian music from the street at night caused me a sleepless night.</p>
<p>The sound of the qin is sad and depressed, like a rainstorm, like flowing water, the rapid and slow rhythms combine into a messy medley. I love to listen, but soon I finally get tired of it.</p>
<p>The deeper music adds to the desolation of the late night.</p>
<p>I cannot fall asleep sweetly, I listen carefully to the footsteps of the qin player. In his stumbling steps, the clouds and smoke at the end of the world feel even heavier, heavier to him.</p>
<p>Darkness walks into the window lattice, I turn on the electric light, and simply spread out a piece of manuscript paper, wanting to write a poem.</p>
<p>The hazy sky is surrounded by a hazy night, the metropolis is in turmoil; unfolding that side of guilt and shamelessness, exposing this side of cries and moans...</p>
<p>Looking at the light yellow light, this is the revelation of light!</p>
<p>Having dipped the ink, I want to write about the qin player on the street, he is my beautiful sentence, and moreover, a person's wandering fate needs me to remember it.</p>
<p>Write it! In the middle of the night, looking back at the back of the qin player, he is hugging the sanxian and crying.</p>
<p>What is he crying about? Perhaps there is a touching story.</p>
<p>The ink has dried, I dip the pen tip into the water bottle for the second time, at this moment I write, no, how do I write</p>
<p>A young couple on the front floor has just returned, the giggling laughter mixed into an unpleasant atmosphere, and the radio is singing: Looking through the autumn water, but not seeing her...</p>
<p>Vulgar songs made me drop my pen, and the hatred in my heart wanted me to shout and yell in disgust.</p>
<p>The result is insomnia, a sleepless night, there is a blank piece of paper on the desk, a page of wordless poems.</p>
<h3>Two Poems</h3>
<p>— Shi Di</p>
<p>Black Bat</p>
<p>In the dusk, the net of night is densely woven,</p>
<p>Shuttling through the mysterious sky;</p>
<p>Gently lower a net,</p>
<p>Only leaking out the twinkling stars in the gaps.</p>
<p>Autumn soars boundless,</p>
<p>Gathering its wings, hovering, and then soaring straight up,</p>
<p>Dragging a long skirt with peacock tail feathers across the earth;</p>
<p>Night march, occasionally with a flash of fire shining.</p>
<p>Wearing the sky clothes of boundless black fluff;</p>
<p>Oh, the black bird that eats mosquitoes on the autumn night</p>
<p>Take advantage of tonight, the trembling under the darkness——</p>
<p>Open your big mouth...</p>
<p>Morning</p>
<p>—Scene in the Countryside——</p>
<p>The morning breeze blows a little poem askew,</p>
<p>Coiling around the top of the farmer's chimney.</p>
<p>The night leaves behind a wisp of green smoke,</p>
<p>Low houses, cloudy trees, vast and boundless.</p>
<p>Smearing the cow with shallow green in the east,</p>
<p>Rippling sunshine on the river;</p>
<p>The crescent-moon-colored floating clouds flow like a broken boat,</p>
<p>Startling a pair of white gulls in the pond reeds.</p>
<p>The first ray of light shines,</p>
<p>Adorning the treetops with brilliance.</p>
<p>Under the loofah rack in front of the square,</p>
<p>There are already busy bees working.</p>

<h3>The Present and Future of the New Spring and Autumn Drama School</h3>
<p>— Li Tongyu</p>
<p>"Does art have temporality?" This question has been hotly debated by many people. But regardless of whether art has temporality, when an art can exist in a certain era and be supported by the public, at least this art has historical value, has technical advantages, and is worthy of being appreciated and studied.</p>
<p>Taking drama as an example, there was a confrontation between new drama and Beijing opera 30 years ago. At that time, new drama unfortunately failed, while Beijing opera still captured the largest number of audiences. In the last decade, spoken drama has risen again. Before the war, the China Travel Troupe, the Experimental Theater, and amateur drama clubs all shone brightly in Shanghai, attracting a large audience. In particular, the China Travel Troupe achieved the greatest effect from Beijing to Shanghai, to Hankou, to Guangdong, and countless cities of all sizes, giving the general public a new impression of spoken drama. In recent years, spoken drama has established a solid foundation.</p>
<p>However, can the rise of spoken drama lead to the decline of Beijing opera? Undoubtedly, Beijing opera has existed for so long that no one can deny its historical value. The new theory of art believes that the existence of art in a certain era must be coordinated with the political, economic, and social trends of that era. In other words, the direct effect of art is to promote politics, society, and economy. However, the Soviet Union, where this theory originated, not only welcomed Mei Lanfang with the greatest effort, but also reissued the complete works of Shakespeare and Tolstoy after the success of the revolution and the change of social system. They are accepting their heritage.</p>
<p>Now to the topic. The New Spring and Autumn Drama School started with the purpose of training Beijing opera students, but later also recruited spoken drama students. Today, when classes officially start, it has become a school that teaches both Beijing opera and rehearses spoken drama. According to the responsible principal, the goal is to melt new and old art into one furnace, take its essence, and carry it forward. This great ambition is worthy of admiration. However, it is a very difficult task to combine Beijing opera and spoken drama into a new opera. The principal, Ms. Pan Wangji, is a famous figure in the Beijing opera amateur world, and the professors hired are mostly senior figures in the spoken drama world. This effort should have good results in the future. Naturally, whether it is Beijing opera or spoken drama, the basis of artistic theory is the same. In particular, the New Spring and Autumn School, which "melts new and old drama into "the furnace," should pay special attention to the essence of art, so that students, in addition to understanding performance and singing, also understand the artistic value of new and old dramas. In fact, becoming an extraordinary artist is indispensable to ignoring the importance of artistic theory.</p>
<p>The New Spring and Autumn School was founded by Ms. Pan Wangji at her own expense, and the preferential conditions for students exceed all previous precedents for drama schools. In today's era of scarcity of dramatic talents, the training of this new force will be a major event worthy of attention in the drama world.</p>
<h3>Zhang Eyun After Arriving in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Yunyun</p>
<p>Zhang Eyun arrived in Shanghai last week from Tianjin. She met with reporters yesterday and was asked about the news of the flood in Tianjin. She said that the water came after the play had ended, and she returned home safely. She did not have to take refuge on the roof, and the second floor of the China Grand Theater was not flooded. It is unlikely that she had to take refuge on the roof. The news in Shanghai is undoubtedly a misrepresentation.</p>
<p>Zhang Eyun is still living in the Jin Lao Mansion in Chujiaqiao this time. She will soon perform at the Huang Jin Theater. The issue of her supporting actors is not easy to solve, because there is no old male role and a lack of young male roles at the Huang Jin Theater. Many plays cannot be performed. The young male role can be played by Shan Tongshan in a cross-dressing role. Once the issue of the old male role is resolved, she can take the stage. She has recently been suffering from an eye disease. It is said that she also suffered from it when she came to Shanghai at the end of last year. After treatment, it has taken effect and will recover in a few days.</p>
<h3>Zhang Eyun's Costumes</h3>
<p>New Movie Introduction</p>
<h3>New Four Daughters</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>“Daughters Courageous”</p>
<p>The story of "New Four Daughters" is very touching: a husband who ran away from home and wandered for twenty years, when he returns to his warm family, his four daughters have already grown up. But his wife is about to marry a wealthy businessman who has been passionately in love with her for twelve years. The unfolding of this tragedy is not limited to simple love; the return of this wanderer will destroy the happiness of the entire family, and also damage the future prospects of the four daughters. Thus, the husband who left home twenty years ago finally sacrifices himself and, on the day of his wife's wedding, embarks on the journey again, continuing his wandering life.</p>
<p>The role of the husband who left home twenty years ago is played by Claude Rains, and the role of the wife is played by Fay Bainter (we will never forget that she is the mother from "Virgin's Anguish"). They portray the conflicting psychology under the clash of emotion and reason very deeply and movingly. In particular, Claude Rains' "close-ups" when returning home and when saying goodbye to his wife are able to express his inner pain through the expressions in his eyes and at the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>In these two scenes (returning home, leaving home), the director uses a contrasting technique to strengthen the tragic atmosphere. For example: the four daughters shaving their new father, the family happily dining together, the wanderer suddenly returning home. After dinner, while everyone is chatting and laughing happily, he sits alone in a corner; while everyone goes to the dance hall, he collapses wearily in a chair. When leaving home, the scene also depicts the joy of the whole family, while Claude Rains quietly leaves, and the whistle of a train sounds in the distance during the wedding. At the same time, the director is able to fully express the psychological state of each individual.</p>
<p>However, the development of the whole play seems not tight enough, because it also has to portray the love lives of the four sisters, and also strengthen the relationship between Priscilla Lane and John Garfield. On the whole, "New Four Daughters" is a good play.</p>
<p>The scenes of the four sisters are just a foil here, and none of them achieve anything particularly outstanding. John Garfield's role, although small, is very steady.</p>
<h3>Silver Screen Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Jia Lu</p>
<p>Xu Xin-fu's film "Lan Fei Shi" (蘭飛屍), originally directed after Chen Charlie returned to China, has now been renamed "Broadcasting Station Massacre" (播音台大血案).</p>
<p>Zhang Wan has been very active recently at Xinhua Film Company. Soon, we will see many of his new works appearing on the screen.</p>
<p>The "Central Studio" (中製) filmed the anti-Japanese war newsreel "Defend the Four Counties" (保衛四大邑) on location in South China. It recently premiered in Hong Kong with great success.

<h3>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Separation and Reunion of Wang Keqin and Zhang Xun</p>
<p>Before Zhang Xun resumed his position, in order to test whether the soldiers under his command supported the restoration, he deliberately released information in Tianjin saying that the General had shaved his queue in Beijing and that the President had bestowed an official title upon him, and that he had resolved not to think about restoration any longer. Who knew that when his soldiers heard this news, they all discussed it one after another. Some said that even if the General shaved his queue, they would not want to shave theirs; others said that if the General returned to Xuzhou and insisted on them shaving their queues, then they would scatter and go back to what they were doing. Therefore, when Zhang Xun got off the train, all the queue-wearing soldiers on the platform and along the route (Zhang Xun always cleared the streets when he went out, cutting off pedestrians) first paid attention to his queue. However, he usually sat in a green sedan chair, wearing a melon-shaped hat and a long gown and mandarin jacket, with a pearl on his hat. When he first got off the car, some people could see that his queue was still hanging behind his head, but once he sat in the sedan chair, with the melon-shaped hat covering his hair, it was impossible to see whether he had cut off his queue or not. When the sedan chair was carried out of the platform for only a few steps, the soldiers were all discussing and craning their necks to look inside. He thought that this was not a safe way, so he had an idea and quickly wrapped his queue from the back of his head to his chest so that the soldiers could see it from afar. So, cheers were heard along the way, saying that the General's queue was still there, and that the brothers would catch and chop up the rumor mongers later. (100)</p>
