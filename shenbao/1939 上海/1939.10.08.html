<p>社評</p>
<h3>湘北戰局的新認識</h3>
<p>湘北戰事到最近爲止，可以說已經告一段落，並且也可以說中國方面已經獲得了超過台兒莊一役的偉大的勝利。當前綫戰訊沉寂了好久以後，正値二十八年雙十節快要屆臨的時候，這種勝利的好消息。不啻替中國國慶日添上了光榮的慶祝資料，試想每一個中國軍民應該怎樣歡忭鼓舞！</p>
<p>所謂日軍新攻勢，原來暄傳已久，遠在歐戰爆發以前，即有所謂主攻助攻遊攻佯攻等消息騰播於中日兩國間。雖然日軍要進攻何地決不會預先宣佈，但是九十月間日軍一定要發動大規模的攻勢，那大槪是他們戰略上必然的需要。何况九月初歐戰旣已爆發，國際間錯係紛紜的關係還沒有十分明朗的時候，那眞是日軍採取新攻勢最適當的機會。日軍在現階段進攻的方向，大體講起來，不出兩途，一是進窺西北，一是打通粤漢路；但限於戰綫和兵力的關係。同時並進這兩條路是不可能的，而且武漢的外圍綫不鞏固，這兩條路的任何一條都不能輕易冒險嘗試。兩個多月以前的所謂山西「掃蕩」戰，顯然是進攻西北的準備；可是這個準備工作失敗了，在目前進攻西北已毫無把握。這一回的湘北戰事，日軍的目標在取得長沙，這顯然是在進行着第二個企圖，希望達到打通粤漢路的初步目的；而且長沙這地方根本也是武漢外圍的重要據點之一，因此即使以後粤漢路打不通，但是奪取長沙却不失爲守衛武漢的必要措置。所以這一回日軍以齋藤偉葉甘粕藤田荻洲等精銳陸軍師團，聯合海軍陸戰隊，共十數萬衆，從贛西湘北同時策動，以最猛烈的攻勢，企圖於短時期內佔領長沙，可見他們對這一决戰役的重視了。萬不料汨羅江南北一向是中國民族大詩人屈靈均忠烈精神廣被深化的地方，此决竟聚殲了日軍兩三萬人，造成了民族史上光榮的戰蹟：這雖然不能就說是中國抗戰已經由此奠定了勝利的基礎，但是日方的攻勢已受到了頓挫，準備了好久的軍事策略已經粉碎，那是確鑿而無可諱飾的。中國的民族精神不可輕侮，中國的抗戰實力正在滋長，在這一回湘北戰役裏，日軍也應該受到事實的敎訓了。</p>
<p>捨軍事的觀點不論，傳聞日軍這回的進攻長沙又另有政治的作用；雖然我們並不需要去揣測日方的政治作用具有什麼內容，但是任何政治作用已在這决戰役失敗中同時失敗，至少已不能順利進行，這也是顯然無疑的。</p>
<p>至於中國方面，雖然湘北戰役不過是抗戰過程中無數决大小戰役中的一役，也是許多决勝利戰役中的一役；但是就這一决戰役的性質而論，却也有若干特點可以認識：第一，長沙的位置在洞庭平原上。而且又接近洞庭湖，極容易遭受對方海陸空軍的同時攻擊，所以在整個的抗戰形勢上講，這地方本有棄守的可能；然而此决華軍居然憑着英勇的血戰，把地理上的限制打破，非但沒有遭到兵臨城下的危機，並且還獲得了絕大的勝利，把日軍驅逐到十多個月前的新牆河舊陣地，這不能不承認是抗戰軍事上的絕大轉機；而且還可以證明向來所呼號的最後勝利，非但不是一句空言，事實上更有提前實現的可能。第二，自從月前歐戰爆發，中國所得到的國際援助，當然不免受有多少影響；然而中國政府本來再三聲明，抗戰以自力爲主，決不注重於國際的援助，現在就在這樣的國際環境之下獲得了一决極大的勝利，旣證實了當局的聲明決不是聊以解嘲，更足以鼓勵全國軍民增高他們的勇氣，加强他們的自信力，這在以後的抗戰繼續過程中，功用是極爲重大的。第三，中國自從放棄武漢廣州以後，抗戰軍隊已經澈底整理，而且在西南一帶，儲備了極豐富的新軍力，不論在人員或武器方面，此决湘北會戰，可說是西南新軍力的「小試其技」。或許在日軍方面也有試探新軍力的意味，但是中國果然獲得了不少的勝利，這可見中國抗戰實力已經增加的一句話決不是不兌現的支票，而對於最後勝利的把握上當然也具有無窮意義的。第四，日軍每進攻一重要地點，常用所謂錐形的戰術，正面突入，華軍爲避免犧牲起見，往往避實就虛，改用包抄的方法拊其側背，但是結果往往因爲軍力懸殊的緣故，日軍的錐形戰術，仍得奏效；此次日軍進攻長沙，還是沿用故技。主力沿粤漢路猛烈南進，可是華軍的側背突擊戰術却竟奏了奇功，可見形勢推移，在軍事技術上講，此時已逐漸轉入華軍有利的階段了。</p>
<p>總之，日軍在對華戰事中每把佔領一大城市作爲幻象的勝利。目前連這種幻象已不容易求得了，這應該是他們深切猛省的時候了罷！</p>

<h3>在侵略威脅條件下　英法兩國決不輕言和平　希特勒建議浮泛晦澀無裨大局　誣蔑波蘭言論英政府嚴詞駁斥　張伯倫將正式闡明態度</h3>
<p>巴黎　參議院外交委員會本日午後開會、達拉第總理當即出席發表演說、措詞激昂、略謂「英法兩國之赴戰、其目標端在制止侵略、關於法國現行外交政策、本人業於本月四日在衆議院外交委員會加以說明、質言之、英法兩國所求者、乃以尊重法律秩序為基礎之和平、因此任何人苟欲在歐洲稱覇、均所不許此種和平、唯有在尊重各種民族自由權利之條件下、始可獲致之、英法兩國在達到此項目標之前、決不停戰、」（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　此間消息靈通人士頃宣稱、張伯倫首相當於下星期之初、就德國元首希特勒昨所提出之「建議」、向下議院發表聲明、但日期尙未確定、大的當於星期一日（本月九日）先行發表簡單演說、然後於星期三日（本月十一日）加以引申、從而切實說明英國態度、而自此際以至彼時、英國政府當與法國政府暨各自治領政府交換意見、至張伯倫首相所當發表之演說、內容如何、可於此間半官方面之評論、窺見一斑、換言之、即希特勒昨所發表之演說、並未含有說判基礎、於以見張伯倫首相當以英國政府各自治領政府曁法國政府名義、堅決拒絕德國方面所提出之建議云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　英政府方面頃已發表一文、對於希特勒演詞中所言各節加以駁斥、略謂希特勒在議會之演說全文、午後始傳抵倫敦、故未及加以詳細之研究、其演詞分爲兩部、前部縷述過去事件、多與眞相相反、此點可爲本國及全世界人民所共曉、如希氏所稱德方在波蘭戰爭中採用人道方法一說、英國會中之議論與華沙英大使之報吿、皆已證明其不確、希氏所謂捷克人自請併入德國版圖一節、無待駁斥、希氏稱一五九八年某英人會以波蘭人殘忍而無道德觀念為言、證諸近事、波蘭國確缺乏任何國家的歷史的文化的或道德的基礎一節、查與一九三五年五月二十一日希氏在議會所發「吾人承認波蘭國爲偉大而愛國的民族國家」等語、完全相反、希氏又謂許多年來、他國有以兒童想像中所可有之目的加諸德國外交政策者云云、他國如對德國果有誤解、則必起於希氏「我之　鬥」一　中所載支配世界之公開野心、與希氏秉　以來之言輪以及希氏之行爲、希氏屢以此次戰禍應由英國貨　為言、實則過去兩年來德國　造成危局、而英政府輒努力保全和平、此種事實、舉世共　、希氏演詞之後部、　有希氏所謂和平提議者數則、此種提議在其目前形式中、大都空泛晦澀、且未　有德國將何以賠償其加諸他國的傷害之建議、惟英政府對此提議、將照首相與外相前已宜布者會同自治領政府與法政府予以慎重研究、但有兩事須牢記者、即（一）和平提議苟未切實使歐洲脫離侵略之危害、則不能認為可予接受、（二）德政府前所給予之保證、終已證明毫無價値、故今日所賴以成立為和平必要基礎之信任者、又不僅為空言巳也云、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>希特勒演辭　並非最後建議　謂外交談判之門洞晵　倘被拒絕當不辭一戰</h3>
<p>柏林　國社黨高級人士昨晚聲稱、倘英法兩國對希特勒德理向德國國會發表和平建議之反應、覺有擴充該項建議時、則希特勒總理甚願照辦、希特勒總理向德國國會致詞畢、國社黨高級官員急向外國新聞記者整明希氏撮述之和平條件、並非德方之最後建議、德方和平進攻並未中止、德國某一有力方面聲稱、希特勒總理演說「語氣溫和」及渠之軍縮建議、將引起美國方面之有益反應、希特勒總理及國社黨其他領袖對於英法初决反應，表示失望、國社黨方面鄭重聲明、無論英法態度若何、希特勒總理不擬靜候完全答覆、德國某一領袖聲稱、「歐洲局勢即將揭曉」、渠稱、倘希氏和平建議被拒、則德國陸海空軍即當在西錢向聯軍施行大規模攻擊、（七日美聯電）</p>
<p>柏林　德國外交部發言人今日答覆德國是吾尙將採取何種外交步驟以促成和平之問題時宣稱、「直率問題亦需要直率答覆、」指陳希氏已申明現局中、德國不能再有所發動、且以通常外交途徑、進行談判之門現固洞開無阻」云、（七日海通電）柏林　此間政界人士對於希特勒在議會發表之演說、非常重視、認爲希氏已在準備進行外交之討論、以謀建樹歐洲之和平、據一般人士之觀察、如何進行外交討論之程序雖未頒布、可望達到諒解之途徑亦尙存在、德國旣已提出建議、各方面均可提出動議、交換意見、關於少數民族之問題、官方尙未發表文吿、目前匈牙利境內尙有日耳曼人六十五萬名、在南斯拉夫境內有日耳曼人七十萬名、在羅馬尼亞有八十萬名、在立陶宛及拉脫維亞、各有日耳曼人的六萬名、在愛沙尼亞較少、的二寓名、在東加利西亞及烏爾希尼亞尙有日耳曼人十二萬名左右、蘇德兩方關於解決少數民族問題、似已擬有合作之計畫矣、至於殖民地問題、權威方面鄭重申稱、此乃德國外交政策之正當的不能移動的要求、與目前之糾紛或戰爭無關、殖民地問題雖可略緩解決、但絕對不能置之不理云（七日海通）</p>
<h3>英法報紙　評論一斑</h3>
<p>倫敦　一「每日民聲報」今日批評希特勒昨日之演說云、希氏如願和平、儘可以行動表示、不必徒託空言、因彼之言論、殊少信用也、希氏可撤退其在波蘭之軍隊、並同意將恢復波蘭與捷克兩事、列於其所提議召開列强會議日程中之首要地位、以此為基礎、庶幾有一種眞正會議之可能性、若所召開之會議、僅爲證實其侵略之收穫、則殊無和平之可言、吾人加入戰爭之原則堅定不移、非空泛諾言或威脅所能動搖云、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　德國兀首希特勒昨所發表之演說、此間各報對之均甚冷淡、或以諷刺口吻出之、咸認爲希特勒巳茫然不知所措、急進社會黨事業報載稱、希特勒元首已陷於進退維谷之境、爰乃支吾其詞、緣渠若提出切實的建議、必爲英法兩國所拒絕、但對於德國人民旣已受有的束、自亦不得不道及和平建議、又因德國無同盟國可資倚畀、則亦不敢公然以威脅加諸各民治國、至德蘇兩國成立軍事同盟條約之事、在勢絕對不可能、史丹林殆已向之說明此意、希特勒乃無一字道及之、」溫和派秩序報載稱、「希特勒元首主張召集國際會議、謂須在事前切實籌備、實則籌備之法、已由張伯倫達拉第哈里法克斯諸公詳細言之、其法維何、即剷除國社主義是也、茲苟欲向希特勒元首提出答案、祇須重申前議而已、」急進社會黨新時代報載稱、「希特勒嘗云、國際輿論如何、非渠所計、其所關切者、　乃德國國內輿論、此可謂大言不慚、實則所謂國內輿論、亦即渠個人所表示之意見而巳」、右派小巴黎人報載稱、「希特勒元首隱的主張先行停戰、然後進行談話、舍此而外、別無何項切實的建議、……德國民衆諗知現行戰事、足以招致貧困與可怖的危機、希特勒元首爰乃亟欲結束戰事以安慰之、」右派時代報載稱、「希特勒元首所言各節、吾人聞之至五六次之多、實已耳熟能詳、……此項演詞平凡之極、諒係對內而發、」巴黎迥聲報載稱、「此項演詞第一部份、可惡之至、言者若稍有廉恥、則此一部份已足使其名譽掃地矣」云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>對希特勒演辭　各國觀感不同　美報謂獰惡論調無裨於和平　各中立國對德猜疑心理未去　蘇聯滿意羅馬同情自在意中</h3>
<p>華盛頓</p>
<p>「華盛頓明星報）批評希特勒之演詞、謂和平未因此種意旨獰惡之論調而更近一步云、「紐約郵報」謂希特勒所發之新議論、大言炎炎、允諾與威脅並作、欲爲歐陸秩序之基礎、殆不可得也云、此間消息靈通之各界皆以爲美國不能贊同如希特勒所提議之和平、因美國不獨拒不承認捷克之命運、且亦拒不承認波蘭之被分割也、使此兩國爲德國附庸之和局、決不能爲美國所歡迎、希氏關於蘇聯之言論、全屬願望想、似以德蘇關係、絞實際上更為友好、而其言及義國之處則尤空泛、並無一語及於墨索里尼對於希氏之軍事義務、希氏要求殖民地之恢復、此將為英國之絕大　步、惟希氏將何以為報乎、則除其和平意旨這保證外、別無報償、而此保證早已為德國破壞不止一次矣、詳繹希氏演詞、未見有希氏讓步以換取其要求之一點、所求者奢而所願給予者則無之、如此知平、德國誠大受其惠矣、然希氏縱得此極大利益、似猶未能與他國融洽也、美國參議員對於希氏演詞、不感興趣、咸以爲與美國中立法案辯論之進行無甚影響、羅斯福總統今日在紐的海德公園吿新聞記者、渠尙未有讀希氏演詞之機會云、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬</p>
<p>義大利人士對希特勒之演詞非常贊成、希氏建議召集國際會議以肅淸與全世界利益有關之政治、商業及軍事之問題、允爲此間人士所稱道、羅馬之政界及外交界方面、正在靜候英法對解決糾紛各項建議之反響、義大利報章認爲希氏之演說、係向和平又移進一步、爲救護歐洲計、希氏之建議、乃惟一之出路云、（七日海通電）</p>
<p>羅馬　義大利　威方面、皆認希特勒之演說、為措　強硬內容充　與含有建設性、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>莫斯科</p>
<p>官方對於希特勒演說、雖不置批評、惟今有種種理由可信、此間對此演說、尤其為演詞中切實担保東歐和平與德蘇單獨决定波蘭命運兩點、均感滿意、德元首並未述及歐戰中可能的蘇聯援助、此可認為蘇聯如屬可能决守中立之另一微象、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　德元首希特勒昨日之演說、此間亦加以轉播、莫斯科政界人士頃第一决加以評論曰、希特勒之和平建議、確切而明白、且亦根據蘇德協定之精神、關於蘇德兩國合作改造東歐秩序一節、各界尤加以特別注意、莫斯科各報今日尙不及發表評論、明日當可見其一二、（七日海通電）</p>
<p>各中立國</p>
<p>巴黎　德國元首希特勒昨所發表之演說、各中立國均以極端猜疑之心理答之、此可於各報論調見之、兹誌其大要如次、</p>
<p>（一）荷蘭國瑪斯波特報載稱、「希特勒元首已感覺其所下之注甚大、頗露窘狀、至以攻擊波蘭國之一段而論、則偉大民族如德國民族、竟以此種論調加諸戰敗之敵人、良可詫異」、</p>
<p>（二）瑞士各報咸謂「此項演詞、不足取信於人、熊城保衛報載稱、此非一種和平建議、僅乃該國向全世界各國人民自作辯護、希特勒元首蓋已作　自缚矣」、</p>
<p>（三）羅馬尼亞京城環球報載稱、「希特勒切望及早停戰、情溢於辭」、其他各報均謂、演詞內容並未包含切實的和平建議、</p>
<p>（四）南斯拉夫京城各報咸謂、英法兩同盟國對於希特勒絕難加以信任、希特勒此决之言論、亦難取信於各該國、</p>
<p>（五）保加利亞京城各報則以希特勒並未切實提出和平建議爲言</p>
<p>（六）土耳其各報評論甚盛、半官機關「烏魯斯報」載稱、希特勒所提建議、「未便予以接受、德國旣已一毛不拔、抑且貪得無饜、今茲對於法國所提供之保證、與前此對於捷克波蘭兩國所提供者、殆前後如出一轍云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>東京</p>
<p>日本報紙批評希特勒演詞、認為英法對於德元首之和平建議未必予以嚴重考慮、「讀　新聞」稱、英法將否接受國際會議、不無可疑、預料英法將櫃續作戰至滿意的恢復波蘭國而後已云、「日日新聞」稱、張伯倫屢有不信任希特勒之表示、今更不必接受提議云、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　今日「日本時報」批評希特勒之演說云、德國現已完成其在波蘭之佔領、如能以此次已成事實爲基礎、而成立和平、則將爲德國偉大之勝利、希氏之演詞中、曾宣布英法如拒絕德方此决之和平建設、則將担負延長歐戰之責任云云、此項宣言或將激刺德國人民以加倍之努力與英法作戰、惟吾人所慮者、此項宣言未必能搖動協的國已定之目的耳、目下事已至此、即有偉大之政治家，亦不能使歐戰在短時期內結束、某種超出人力之事件將驅使歐戰獲痛苦之結局云、（七日路透社電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福對歐局　不顧遽作調人　須先獲得英法同意保證</h3>
<p>華盛頓　據參院外交委員會主席畢德門聲稱、時機一成熟、羅斯福總統願對歐洲和平略盡微勞、唯必須交戰雙方確有協調之意思表現時、總統始能出而有所動作、在交戰國此項意思未表明前、總統若有所表示、則交戰國方面必將認爲冒昧之干涉行動、惟條件具備時、羅總統必願出爲調人也、（七日美聯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　柏林方面所傳美國及其他中立國家將出而支持希特勒之和平恣態、此間政府官員對之不願有所批評、此間觀察家認此項消息並不可靠、除非英法願意以希氏之建議爲談判之基礎外、美國決不顧有所行動、且美國所能為者、僅為友誼之調解、（七日美聯電）</p>
<p>柏林　據戈林將軍之機關報「愛森國民新聞」今日載稱、美國對於希特勒之和平建議、或能予以贊助、蘇聯或亦能爲歐洲和平盡其努力、德國爲促成和平計、極願接受停戰辦法、以便召開國際會議從事和平之談判、德國願意接受歐洲之現狀、德國今後之要求僅在殖民地之返還上面、叉謂、墨索里尼。弗朗哥。與敎皇不久皆發動和平運動、至於羅斯福總統之地位、因其爲領袖中立國之元首、故最合於調人之資茶（七日美聯）</p>

<h3>希特勒演說　對美並無影響　美參院一般情緒無變化</h3>
<p>華盛頓　希特勒昨日在德國國會中之演說對美國會辯論修正中立法案事、並無影響、尼不拉斯加共和黨參議員諾里斯謂、「余對希特勒已無信任、彼說謊之决數太多、每於獲得某處後、彼必表示並無再有領土野心、」孤立派中堅份子波拉謂、「余等對雙方言詞、皆不相信、」孤立派中最年靑之參議員霍爾特謂、「此僅爲另一歐洲問題、無論彼等如何解決、亦惟爲下决大戰立一基石而已、」烏達州民主黨參議員金氏謂、彼深信蘇德將合作摧毀各民主國家、（七日美聯電）</p>

<h3>日政府召回　駐德大使</h3>
<p>東京　日本政府昨日宣布召回日本駐德大使大島浩中將、該項舉動、係日本政府對主張日本加入羅馬柏林軸心者之叉一打擊、消息靈通方面人士聲稱、大島浩中將爲主張與德義締結軍事同盟之最力者、渠之遺缺、將由日本駐比大使來栖三郞繼任之、衆認來栖係日本外交界傾向民主國家派、渠之任命可視爲痛斥日本少壯派內主張與歐洲軸心國家締結軍事同盟、（七日美聯電）</p>

<h3>美國派艦　保護商輪　依洛夸伊斯號　因受德方警告</h3>
<p>華盛頓　海軍委員會昨日宣稱、「依洛夸伊斯」號船員已接得白宮方面之訓令、加意小心航行、總統秘書歐萊昨日發言證實、德海軍大將賴德曾使德海軍參贊於彼向美發出之警吿上、加以簽署、另訊謂賴德大將獲此情報、係來自愛爾蘭方面、但未能證實、賴德大將向美政府警吿謂、載美僑回美之「依洛夸伊斯自」號將遭受與「雅典尼亞」號同一之命運、被英法方轟擊之、羅斯福總統在海德公園發表談話、謂對「依洛夸伊斯」施行軍艦護衛、將來不能援爲先例、而對每艘美輪皆施行同一保護、（七日美聯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　今日此間官方發表文吿稱、英海軍部對於柏林所發美船伊洛夸伊斯號亦將在雅典尼亞號輪前所遭遇之環境中被人轟沉等語、已予以注意、查雅典尼亞號係被德潛艇轟沉該輪負責輪員之遇救者會明白目擊德潛艇、當時數百哩內並無英潛艇、故德政府今竟發此言論、復使英國明瞭與測量國社黨領袖之犯罪心理、然德帝國時代之海軍軍官如現任德海軍首腦賴特大將者、竟不惜同流合汚、自貶聲望、殊可驚異、（六日路透電）</p>

<h3>金融　出口貿易增旺　外滙逐步鬆動</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美匯暗市仍形穩定蓋以近日華軍、前方大捷、並傳南昌近郊軍事亦有勝利消息、是以多方莫不具有戒心、中途港電與沙邊相繼塞出，兼日來海關統計、絲茶蛋品、均有大宗出口、致外匯頭寸吐售者較多、但匯豐等外行吸胃尙佳、故市面鬆勢緩和、最硬銀行吃進價英金計四辦士五六二五、美匯爲七元六二五、惟午收以四辦士五一五六二五及七元五六二五、結果英較美爲鬆、乃受美對英匯兌續小一分半之影響、至十月份與十一月份趨勢參差、終則均稍軋長、照午收十月份與十一月份英金距離〇七八一二五、美匯相差一五六二五、約合月息（除佣）祇二分一釐光景、而實際上套利者、殊難獲得、半天交易平淡、</p>
<p>沙遜相繼塞出</p>
<p>晨初以倫教大條、近遠期均暴漲一辦士三五、紐約銀價長一二五、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美·滬·法等俱平、美對英縮一分半、對滬未更、對法小一二五、中央掛牌、各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士四六八七五、美匯七元半、較之前收、均無榮辱、開後香港首來電塞、兼西商沙遜亦跟踪吐售、是以爲狀穩中帶硬、計港電與沙遜賣予有利某行現貨英金四辦士半、及現貨美匯七元五三一二五與五六二五、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉大七分、此後洋行扒結某行現貨美匯七元五三一二五、但不久出口商頻來供塞、故情况穩中帶硬、計出口商塞予匯豐有利現貨英金四辦士半及五六二五、並吐予大通華比等外行現貨美匯由七元五六二五硬至六二五、嗣後賣風漸息、致狀態愈形平靜、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士五一五六二五、美匯七元五六二五、本月份英金四辦士半、美匯七元五三一二五、十一月份英金四辦士四三七五、美匯七元四〇六二五、結果比上日、現貨英鬆〇四六八七五、美硬〇六二五、木月份英鬆〇六二五、美錢〇九三七五、十一月份英美均長〇三一二五、午後週六無市，</p>

<h3>金市港帮仍在吸收</h3>
<p>昨日現金始赤暗盤市祝、雖午前外匯趨勢稍形鬆動、兼以塲中遍傳南昌近郊亦有勝利消息、但金價屹然未動、竟反馳高挺、然此中不無主要原因、蓋港帮自晨至午猛扒未曾間歇、撑力之大可想而知、當日經過、晨開聞外滙帶硬、略形平疲爲四千零五十五元開盤、嗣後外匯雖鬆、但某銀樓與某錢兌業粉代港帮猛進、午刻一度盤高至四千零六十七元頂價、結果以四千零六十六元收盤、較隔昨尙軋漲六元、惟中途某金號會代多方乘機出籠、一度回挫、卒以供不敵求、故難久持、午後週六停市、聞暗盤仍有做開、市象忽以電傳宋氏任駐美大使之說、咸料對中國財政有極大之扶植、致此時港帮納胃轉呆、形勢遂不支下疲、聞已回落至四千零五十元關內、半天交易尙旺、的八九百兩光景、銀樓飾金終日無變、海關金等均仍平定、</p>
<p>烚赤上落祗十二元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開聞外匯帶硬、略形平疲、開市做小五元、證券帮售予金號二十兩、爲四千零五十五元、開後因香港帮前來活動、形勢即見轉穩、現金號進錢兌業三十兩、及證券帮進金號一十兩、均爲四千零五十八元、俄即證券帮復吐予某銀樓二十兩、爲四千零五十七元、時某錢兌業進同業及銀樓帮共二百餘兩、爲四千零五十八元及六十元、同時某銀樓亦進同業三十兩、爲四千零六十元、此後雖香港帮吸納仍健、但因某金號代客方傾向出籠、且外匯續趨鬆勢、故市價終稍回下、銀樓帮賣予證券帮二十兩、價爲四千零五十九元、某金號力塞予某銀樓百餘兩、價由四千零五十八元做小至五十六元、此後賣方供意漸淡、加之某錢兌業復代港帮吸購、故情况重趨向上、立回高四元、某銀樓進金號十兩、價爲四千零六十元、繼又步高三元、某錢兌業進銀樓帮二十兩、價爲四千零六十三元、後銀樓帮與錢兌業頻來塞出、一度又撳小至四千零五十九元、但不久某銀樓又起買風、兼金號亦稍跟進、立抬高七元、某銀樓進錢兌業十兩、價爲四千零六十六元、嗣因現金號套賣較殷、回小四元、錢兌業互做十兩、爲四千零六十二元、午刻因某銀樓再起買風、市象重趨堅挺、抬升五元、某銀樓進現金號二十兩、價爲四千零六十七元、繼之錢兌業進證券帮十兩、為四千零六十六元作午收價、結果比上日尙軋長六元、半天祇十二元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價照烚赤較高十元、收進的减小三十元光景、現　金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金屹立不動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、同烚赤鮮少上落、致仍未更動、大同行懸四百十元、新同行與上價相同、收進約减低二十元光景、</p>
<h3>大條暴長　—一便士二五—</h3>
<p>六日倫教電、大條銀市印度及投機家買進、供給有限、致近遠期均飛長一辦士二五、市况平、收市後無大交易、又紐約電美銀價現貨長一二五、現貨三角五分一二五、又孟買電、印銀現期貨均猛長一羅比〇五安那、市况平、成交單共五十張云、</p>
<h3>貼現低落</h3>
<p>昨日滙劃票據貼現率、突然下落、每千元上午仍站七十元左右、下午忽見下低至六十七元五角、比前日低二元半、錢業公會拆息早午兩市均掛一角九分、</p>
<h3>外幣紛紛下跌</h3>
<p>昨日外幣以滙市經出口商一再傾塞後、市氣益難振作、同業心理亦不看好、於是賣賣氣頗盛、大有供過於求之感、結果英金鎊跌五角、英金票降三角、美票均小一角半、香港票落二分、法郞票减二厘、坎拿大票降一角、日金票及朝鮮票跌勢甚厲、前者計小二分、後者亦降一分五厘、</p>
<h3>證劵　湘北戰事好轉　內債漲勢愈勁　外股亦形活躍</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市况、趨勢益見堅强、上下午均仍拾級上升、人心自湘北戰事好轉後、消息傳來、多方氣熖愈高、非特不願脫手、且有加碼者、零星散戶獲利結出、亦爲數不多、趨勢以午後爲允勁、甲種穿出五十五元、乙種穿出四十八元、丙戊種均衝出七元關、丁種因輪到抽籤最近、更穿出六元及七元兩重關口、形勢極佳、各帮均看丙丁戊三種、不久必將衝出五十元大關、昨日上午價堅穩、上漲三五角、午後消息更佳、各債均穿出一元關、丙種因九日抽籤、故自九日起即按除中籤計算、昨日下午乃做兩個行市、連籤與除中籤相差的半元左右、市價結果、續漲六角至一元二角、成交總數、的計一百萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中國銀行股五十股、價爲五十三元、</p>
<p>又衆業公所報吿云、昨日股市活躍能力、未見衰减、各著名股又有新高價出現、邇來市塲似有不少資金流入、臆想中殆爲一般人因最近別種市塲、投機範疇縮小、而來加入股市之故、即以匯市而論、前此近遠期差額至巨、一度能與套利者以極厚子息、目下因匯率漸見軋攏、已無多大吸引力存在、彼時用以套利之大量本金、此時轉以投於各種實業股票、自亦意料中事、</p>
<p>倫敦六日電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、仍開上海自來水等數種、行情平穩無變動、</p>
<p>倫數六日電今日中國外價仍開中法美金等四種、掛牌行市平穩不動、</p>
<p>利喊汽車公司派息</p>
<p>本埠英商利喴汽軍有限公司、昨經董事會議決定於十月十三日起、開派一九三九年份中期股息、每股國幣一元、</p>
<h3>糧食　杜米一漲　又見回平　客秈成交五千包</h3>
<p>米市跌風轉定、因靑角蘇嘉等地來貨、計由輪車運到四千餘包、河下則又以斷貨聞、故運跌之後、引起本鄉店胃動辦、早市遂一度帶緊、各價曾喊高半元有奇、終以日來市面上落劇烈、業中人未免時抱　忌、故至午市又見　懈、市况遂亦先緊後軟、適成定局、收盤眞特常錫破爲四十一元至四十元、中市三十五元、次爲三十三元、常州白破三十八元、中三十四五元、新粳三一十三元、蘇同崑破粳三十三四元、新粳三十一二元、靑角菉種三十二元、密種三十一元、至三十元、楓嘉百哥三十元至二十八元半、松江薄破三十三四元、特羊尖二十五元、决爲二十三元、特蘆尖二十六元、次爲二十四元半、江北尖二十元、决爲十九元半、蕪湖白尖二十元零六角、、中市二十元至十九元半、决十八元八角至十八元半、砶尖十八元至十七元半、陳變元三十二三元、新元三十元至二十九元七角、統市成交數七千餘包、</p>
<p>另訊、昨市客秈已經轉站、緣邇日各米一再慘跌後、販戶以成本高昂、搬運不劃、今後來源或須見减、且市上盛傳江北一帶採辦證會有限至本月十一日截止、不再續發之說、人心仍見回平、又以客秈價碼低宜、砶米十八元、機十九元均合四鄕與內地及本街之需要、成交加至五千餘包、高决各檔立見提高二三角、惟昨到蕪湖米六千餘包、</p>
<h3>麺粉客銷銳减　小麥呈供求兩少　存底約四十萬包</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日現粉交易、更見平淡、客銷因目下廠棧堆置困難、與加收損失費問題、致客戶進胃銳减、祇能依據船位而辦、本街零批交易、亦屬有减無增、惟廠槃仍須七元原盤、未肯遞鬆、故回籠貨求售者、亦不若前兩日之迫切、聞老車牌價開六元七角半至七角、兵船牌與紅藍福新價爲六元六七角、統市本客成交、的有二萬餘包、市面變化、要待下週初云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日小麥供求兩少、各地來源、的計五六千包、自申地市價回小以來、販運者已日見减少、惟目下產價仍昂、售者不肯賤脫、昨日廠胃平淡、業外囤戶、略有問津、查日下小麥存底、的有四十萬包、在此洋麥來源不繼聲中、市面亦難看小、大致定站而已、統市由福新阜豐兩廠合辦常·錫·京·蘇·等麥共一千二百包、及散囤吸進三四車、價九元八角至九元、市面</p>
<h3>油市　豆油又創新高價</h3>
<p>豆油近因來源不接、囤戶加碼、且流言朋興、致以一般操縱家、見有機可乘，趁勢猛力拉抬、良以行情邁步前進、昨日又創最新高價、計神戶油開至七十四元八角、成交八十桶、大連油收盤七十三元五角、共成五十桶、膠州油做至四十七元、共開一百七十件、又烟岐油爲四十七元八角五十件、靑歧油四十六元二角、成交五十件、及白絞聽裝油三百聽、價爲六十三元、花生油港方辦去靑島聽裝油一千四百聽、爲七十五元五角、市處平穩之局、尙無特別變遷云、</p>
<h3>煤炭鴻基煤　又到二千餘噸</h3>
<p>近日鴻基煤連續而來、昨日又有二千二百四十餘噸到　、係太古公司、蘇州輪運來、於昨午進口、停靠法租界外灘、該行碼頭起卸（租）</p>
<h3>紗花　實銷太滯　紗市上升乏力</h3>
<p>紗市始挫　堅、趨勢紊亂不一、仍以實銷不旺、人心疲弱、且有虛浮之多額斬結、故市態更帶萎靡之象、惟一般大戶逢低落仍來吸收不放、至於客帮、香港帮在下跌時塌便貨之心思又起、所以目前尙在徘徊之途、根本問題、因實際交易太滯、上升之能力不振、至於大跌、亦因廠根不鬆、逖呈躊躕之象矣，</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣甚餧、有一部份撳價賣出、開價二十支雙馬現貨價爲七百二十元、比上日大跌二十元、棧單價尙平、祗小七八元、少頃因價廉買者陡擁、同時廣帮亦來拖進、一跳十元爲七百三十五兀、棧單價爲七百十五元、迨至收盤時、紛傳南昌軍事好轉、人氣允振、再漲三四元、雙馬現出價爲七百四十二元、棧單價爲七百二十元、查半日成交統計九百四十五包、行情二十支雙爲漲五角、天女勿動、雙地球跌一元、、牧羊跌十一元、廠方由申新廠開出十支童子軍五百五十包、價爲五百九十元、三二支天女二百包、價爲八百五十元、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列於左、</p>
<p>香港　一三〇　同行　五九五</p>
<p>內地　二二〇　統計　九四五</p>
<p>上日成交　一五〇　共計　一、六九五</p>
<h3>通太花跌三四元</h3>
<p>本棉生意、成交尙稱不弱、但賣價因到貨一時擁擠而受影響下挫、但此後來源、是吾能繼續暢爽、尙屬問題也、今則棉價通花跌二三元、太倉花下三四元之譜、華廠未會動辦、惟日廠對於印棉辦進四百件、一蘇北到通丹花五千六百九十八包、常陰沙到二千七百零九包、茲將現棉情形列左、</p>
<p>新通花　一四五·〇同業一千餘包</p>
<p>太倉花　一四二·〇又又三百包</p>
<p>惠司登　一八〇·〇大康二〇〇件</p>
<p>彭家浦　一八二·〇又又二〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、日來因滙兌殊爲鬆動、同業改抱觀望態度、廠方亦因各方謠言、故對原棉之購辦、心意殊爲鬆懈、惟廠方存底不厚、印棉運華水脚、將於下月起增收二成、目前市上巴西棉到貨甚多、價殊廉宜、購辦廉棉此其時矣、按照各方意見、將來匯兌恐難再長、故同業間凡藏有手貨者、均不願出售也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市晨初因同業購買而漲、利物浦來電吿漲、現貨交易、日來因遠東方面需要激增、出口商頗形活躍、市况殊爲堅定、亦漲十餘磅音、後又因多頭出籠、市况忽又回挫、結果收盤價格較之上日尙漲五六磅音、印度棉市殊爲靜寂、埃及棉市昨日跌落十餘磅音、利物浦漲五便士、</p>
<h3>絲茶　輯里絲略有交易　售價漲三十元許</h3>
<p>邇來國內絲市、白廠絲交甚覺岑寂、蓋本埠絲廠、現尙能不受原料影響而繼續開工者截止目下已極佔少數、故一般手貨更停滯于廠方手中、以待善價、昨日橫濱絲價雖已報漲三十五元、但上海絲交仍末能開展、輯里經市况、週前曾一度顯示俏利、但亦因內地存貨無多、允以上身絲更缺、故六個號子之輯里絲交、亦入僵持狀態、昨僅輯里中干與下干絲、售開一百數十担、價一六八零兀、計漲三十元許云、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價上落靡定</h3>
<p>昨洋糖交易無多、復見回降、公會劃盤一四粗白小五六角、本棧五十四元半、外棧初爲五十五元、旋小至五十四元四角、轉口貨仍四十二元半、太古車白小二角、東棧B嘜五十九元、西棧五十九元三角、CW嘜五十八元八角、CX嘜五十八元三角、DJ嘜五十七元八角、HX嘜五十七元三角、H嘜車赤小五角、爲四十二元七角、荷赤四十叫元、小二角、本綿白降半元、振記一號五十五元半、二號五十五元、三號五十四元半、四號五十四元、本冰小一元、一號六十六元半、晶明牌六十八元、國糖興化赤白尙未報出、仍乏正式市面、其勢决難過高、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新興圓　議盤高昂</h3>
<p>桂圓新興化貨後到以成本高昂、未能見鬆、議盤業已開出、計正牌禿禿一百六十八元、桶全一百六十七元、正二一百六十三元、三全一百二十五元、興極一百〇五元、四圓一百三十五元、冷氣陳貨相差十餘元至十元不一、過烘陳貨再减十一二元至五元、</p>
<h3>疋頭　絨布獨俏　其他下落者多</h3>
<p>國布　昨市繼續下落、緣香港當局加跋統制匯兌、滙水暴漲、新加坡等地亦採同樣措施、故夸帮南洋帮辦胃情形呆滯、其餘各地鑒於市價疲落、一致减少添辦、故交易甚爲淸閒、惟本街及江浙內地帮以秋銷發展、交易極盛、故當銷各貨以絨布最爲堅俏、市盤每疋獨漲二角半至五角、現貨缺乏、刮絨廠日夜趕速交貨、細布細斜以殊尠做開、每疋價跌二三角、粗布粗斜本街採辦二百餘包、價跌五分至一角、色布色斜交易極稀、各批發號儘力走銷存貨、均無購胃、惟春令淺色貨條素府綢漂布漂斜、經川津長江帮客戶搜羅囤積市上存貨淺薄、十分居奇、</p>

<h3>關於國慶</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>本報於去年雙節復刊，可是刹眼又是一個國慶紀念日；因此，今年的國慶，是本報復刊後的一週紀念日，而也是兒童週刊復刊後的一週紀念日。我們在不舉行儀式之下，慶祝雙十，同爲本報慶，爲兒童週刋慶。</p>
<p>凡是一個現代的國家，都有一個國慶的日子。就世界各國的國慶紀念日說來，像二月十六日是立陶宛的國慶紀念日，二月二十四日，愛沙尼亞的國慶紀念日，三月二十五日，希臘的國慶紀念日，四月十五日，西班牙的共和國獨立日，五月十七日，挪威的國慶紀念日，五月二十日，古巴的國慶紀念日，六月十六日，瑞典的現皇生日，七月一日，加拿大的自治領紀念，七月四日，美國的獨立紀念日，七月九日阿根廷的國慶紀念日，七月十四日，法國的共和紀念日，七月二十八日，秘魯的獨立紀念日，八月一日，瑞士的聯邦政府創立日，八月六日，玻利維亞的獨立紀念日，八月十一日，德國的憲法實施日，八月二十日，匈牙利的國慶紀念日，八月二十五日，烏拉圭的國慶紀念日，八月三十一日，荷蘭的現女皇生日，九月十六日，墨西哥的獨立紀念日，九月十八日，智利的獨立紀念日，九月二十六日，丹麥的現皇生日，十月五日，葡萄牙的國慶紀念日，十月二十八日，捷克的國慶紀念日，十月二十九日，土耳其的共和紀念日，十一月七日，蘇聯的革命紀念日，十一月九日，波蘭的國慶紀念日，十一月十一日，意大利的現皇生日，十一月十二日，奧國的國慶紀念日，十二月六日，芬蘭的獨立紀念日。</p>
<p>由於上文所說，世界各國，每是把開國紀念，改建共和，或獨立的日子，以及國皇的生日，當做國慶紀念。而到了這一天，舉國同慶，是非常熱閙的。中國的所以定雙十爲國慶，是紀念辛亥革命的成功。過往到了國慶，我們也不例外，要來一决盛大的慶祝。但，自「九一八」之後，國難深重，一直到戰事爆發，迄今已六七年，到了國慶不舉行仟何儀式。有國而不能慶，使任何人感到鬱悶。然而我們可期待着，等到最後勝利之日，我們來一决熱鬧，在歡，去慶祝中國復興後第一個雙十節吧！</p>
<h3>雙十新義勗兒童</h3>
<p>— 熾强</p>
<p>今年是第二十八個雙十節了，把這些接連起來，太像一架梯子了，這該是象徵了我們大家耍靠此爬上建國大道上去的一架梯子。</p>
<p>雙十！雙十！一隻十再加上一隻十。</p>
<p>小朋友！國慶的雙十，要你們運用你們身邊的「雙十」來創造！</p>
<p>小朋友，思索一下吧！你身邊的雙十究竟在那裏？也許你反而將要伸出手來向我要。不必問我要，你用雙手去創造，你用十指去抓牢；你的雙脚貼近祖國的山河，十個脚趾頭搘拄着中華國土的根基，這原來「國子」—小主人翁的事體。</p>
<p>讓沉渣浮起，讓穢溷奔流，你還得用「雙十」去摧枯拉朽，聽說澄淸就在不久。</p>
<p>這回我鄭重地想了一番，這個雙十節的慶典，應該責成你們拿去辦。</p>
<p>你們的雙手够清白，兩脚最穩實；慶雙十，孕育雙十慶，慶了的送過去再迎來，「生生不减」！「自强不息」！只有你們的「雙十」（手足）繼殼得上和雙十打成一片！</p>
<p>小朋友！來來來，今天且來預祝雙十節，從十一日起，就要你們創造明年的雙十慶！謹以此新義相勗！</p>
<h3>小故事</h3>
<p>先生在講臺上問：「誰會上來寫三個生字」？明德說：「我會，先生說「跳」，他寫個「跳」字；先生說「踢」，他寫個「踢」字。先生看了搖搖頭說：「錯」！明德以爲聽錯，便不寫了，先生再呌別的學生寫，都寫得不對，這時候一民說：「我會寫」，先生說「跳」他寫「跳」；先生說「跟」他寫「踢」；先生搖搖頭道說：「錯」！他就寫個「錯」字，先生說；「你對了」（次愷）</p>
<h3>大獵</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>—明兒避難記之三十七—</p>
<p>十一月又飛快的過去，從明兒在十月底到了那村子計算起來，已度了一個月的異鄕生活了。明兒身上穿的單薄衣也變了厚夾衣，這顯然的，那時已是秋末冬初的季節。</p>
<p>打獵在那時季中風行遍了整個的村莊。明兒鄰家的幾個大孩子差不多天，到山野裏去打獵，總是帶着些收穫回來。這可引起了明兒深深的稱羨—開槍是多麽的有趣；乒的一聲，打中了野兎，是多麽的歡喜；拿了一大串的收穫歸來，是多麽的榮耀，這也可表示我眼力的不差；而野兔又可作為我們一頓鮮美的菜肴。這一陣幻想在他心頭裏湧蕩着，終於把這意思吿知了母親，却碰了壁，因爲打獵在伊心目中是一件危險的事，而這對於明兒的身體又是不十分相宜的，伊老人家太愛惜伊的兒子了。一天，他要求母親答應他跟着他們見識，不知怎的，竟得了伊的同意。</p>
<p>他們肩了土槍—和明兒所看見那巡警的槍很相像，但是比較短小了一些。那槍每次只能一發，開了一槍後，再裝火藥和鐵粒，很是麻煩，而手續又很繁複，當撥動那槍機時，火星隨着乓的一聲四濺開來，假使彈藥裝得不好，而眼睛又在槍上瞄凖，要是火星濺到到到眼裹，那不是玩的；所以害得明兒連開都不敢開，只能看他們去玩了—便打了個口哨，自然而然的，在那鄰家附近的狗，似乎是知道一般的，搖頭擺尾地聚集攏來。他們指了指手，它們便隨即開着先鋒，在那熟悉的路上，一邊嗅一邊去追逐了。那些打獵的大孩子在後跟隨着，明兒也加入他們的集團。</p>
<p>他們一羣四五個人從明兒割草的那一條路走過了後，又踏上了一條更狹小而彎曲的小路，而四旁的枯草也更團團的聞了過來，時常和他們的衣襟發生摩擦而擠軋。那許多條的狗在亂草叢中，用着它們尖銳的嗅覺搜索着他們的目的物。這時他們也不知覺的離了小路成爲散兵綫般展開了戰綫，那草長過了他們的頭頂，深深的埋在中間，作爲很好的僞裝，不過一陣陣草和衣服的傾軋聲，這很妨礙他們的任務。他們每個人的槍都早已裝妥了彈藥，在等待着撥動槍機的命令，銳利的限光似探照燈般射在那叢草中亂跑亂跳的狗；而那耳朶好像擴大了耳殼，收聚那狗的聲息；脚當然也隨着狗的蹤跡加快了速度，採取了大包圍的攻勢，由廣大的戰區縮成了狹窄的範圍，凖備集中一點作一番猛烈的攻擊，便加緊的包抄過來。那些靈敏的狗，隨地隨地幹它們偵緝的工作，有時在那一點嗅個不休，這是敵人—他們的目的物——的露跡，便拚命的飛趕過去。那些山野裏的生物，也是五步一哨，十步一崗的佈着警戒綫。那時一陣緊急的警報—草的瑟縮聲，便抱着不抵抗的向四方沒命的逃竄。那偵察的狗先鋒隊便大聲的在吠起來，接着一陣槍聲，動作呆笨的生活，便飲彈而犧牲，作爲狗的口中物，雖被他們搶奪了過去，而一顆頭早當了狗的美餐，血淋淋的很是慘酷！這一幕弱肉强食的慘劇，在明兒的腦海裏銘刻了一個個很深的印象—打獵倒底是「憑强凌弱」的侵略行爲！我們應爲無辜的弱小者反抗那强暴者的侵略！</p>
<h3>歷史故事連續畫</h3>
<p>— 瘦鷗</p>
<p>關於兒童課餘讀物，確也是一個很嚴重的問題，允其在那些富於神怪意味的「連環圖畫」充斥街頭的上海，更有値得注意的必要。</p>
<p>所謂「速環圖畫」，多數是從那些擺在弄堂口的小書攤上租借出來的，圖畫和文字都極拙劣，印刷也很糟，意義的歪曲附會，自在意中；所以對於兒童們，眞是有百弊而無一利，可是已經懂得看書的兒童們也和大人一般的具有一種不可遏制的慾望，就是希望在課本以外，再讀一些有趣味的書；所以要强制他們不去租借這種「連環圖畫」是不行的，唯一的辦法就是用別的出版物去移轉他們的注意力。</p>
<p>春江書局的主事人便在這種動機之下，開始編繪了一套「歷史故事連續畫」，計分十輯，（一）岳飛，（二）費宮人，（三）勾踐，（四）荊軻，（五）聶政，（六）花木蘭，（七）文天祥，（八）史可法，（九）秦梁玉，（十）戚繼光。祇要一看這名單，我們就可以知道這些連續畫所含的意義是怎樣値得重視了。現在第一輯岳飛已經出版了，由小學敎育專家錢長齡君主編，畫家胡右佛君繪畫，文字旣那麽的簡潔明顯，圖畫又極生動活潑，在此時此地，委實可算是最値得介紹的兒童讀物了。</p>
<h3>藍矮子（三）</h3>
<p>— 哀黎</p>
<p>阿立想了一想，又開口說道：「還有哩，當初我們見了那牛拖的車子，不是也覺得很奇怪麽？到了如今，我們見了奇怪的東西，也不以為奇，因為已瞧得慣了，阿麗，可不是麽？咦，阿麗，快快來瞧，那邊街頭上來了一個婦人，背上背着一隻籃子，竟像一座屋子那麼大，你可會見過麼？」阿麗見他似乎已忘記了那矮子問題，倒也很樂意，因此就伴着他看那個背着大藍子的婦人了。</p>
<p>阿麗和阿立的伯父最喜歡旅行，常常到那些冷僻的地方去，不像別的避暑的旅客們，總是揀着奢華而熱鬧的地方去的。這一回他們就在旅行德國的一個小村子，曾在鄰近參觀了好幾家磁器廠，玻璃廠，瞧見了許多新奇的東西。這一天早上，他們曾到一家最大的磁器廠去，非常高興地回來，他們的頭腦裹，就充滿著籃矮子等一切美麗的印象。</p>
<p>他們此刻是在客寓裹一個最好的廳事中，他們的伯父先期定下，打算在這裹小住幾天的，他們的伯母已很疲倦，正靠在一張沙發上休息着，姊弟倆便坐在那寬闊的窗檻上，看那外面街上經過的一切起了他們無限的興趣。</p>
<p>伯母聽得他們在那裹刺刺不休的講話，忽然抬起眼睛來問道，「你們倆老是在那裹講些什麼啊？我似乎已睡過去了一會，但我却仍聽得你們的聲音，好像小鳥兒吱吱喳喳地不住的呌着。」阿麗很不安似的問道：「伯母，我們可曾打擾你麽？」伯母忙道：「不，並不，但你們且走過來，把你們剛才所講的一起說給我聽聽。」</p>
<p>阿立一聽這話，又立刻想起了籃矮子，很鄭重的說道：「伯母，也許你解說起來，比阿麗要清楚一些。我要請問你的，便是世界上到底有沒有矮子國，他們是不是仙人的一種？伯母，請你給我說個明白。伯母很詫異的說道：「阿立，你說矮子嗎？矮子國嗎？這是什麽一回事？」阿麗忙把剛才說起籃矮子的事向伯母說了；伯母聽得很趣味。</p>
<p>阿麗說完之後，伯母便對阿立說道：「我們在這一次旅行中，所見奇奇怪怪的事物太多了；我們必須見怪不怪，不要過分的大驚小怪。阿立，你倘見了矮子，也像見了普通的人們一樣，向他們稱一聲「先生」，深深的一鞠躬，而他們對於你，也一樣的很和善，很有禮貌的。你不要以為他們是什麽妖怪之類，而鬧出笑話來。」</p>
<p>伯母說到這裹，客廳的門開了，他們的伯父已走了進來，他老人家也是一個很和善而很有趣味的人。阿立一見了他，把藍矮子問題和伯母所說的話全都拋開了，他立刻趕到伯父跟前，有一搭沒一搭的問了好多的話，末後又問到他繼續旅行時，預備坐什麽車子，是不是坐一輛卡車，他能不能和那趕車的人並坐在一起？　（未完）申報　兒童周刋</p>

<h3>建立兒童戲劇</h3>
<p>— 采金</p>
<p>兩年來，——上海淪陷的兩年來，我們不容吾認戲劇在這期間是非常的蓬勃，雖然在收穫方面不能盡如人意，至少因大小戲劇團林立而引起了一番「景氣」是眞的。我們在目前雖未能在爭取觀衆的成績上作一個估計，至少我們對於被一致認爲未來的主人翁——兒童，這一環忽略是毫無疑義，這個責任不只每個劇運工作者是應該肩起的，就是每一個愛護兒童愛護文化的人是應該有一些義務的，所以在今日，我們提出「需要兒童的戲劇」是必要的，而且應該付以最大的努力建立兒童的戲劇，開闢新興的園地。</p>
<p>「兒童戲劇」並不是一條平坦的大道，尤其在「此時此地」的情况下，黑暗的勢力正用全力在壓迫一切文化的部門，但是我們不能因爲馬路太艱難，太困苦而不去開拓，不去推進；相反地，我們正應該以毅力迎接困難，在不妨害我們的目的的條件下，是應該盡量的利用技巧來建立兒童的戲劇，這種方法却不同於屈服，而是活用戰鬥的方法。</p>
<p>要做一件工作決不是一兩個人或團體就能够完成的，所以我們要「建立兒童的戲劇」必需多方面的合作和努力的，第一，我們要請求戲劇界的同仁集中一部分的目光到兒童的戲劇上來；第二，要求創作劇本的作家要注意到敎育兒童的目的，必需盡量發揮兒童的天眞，切莫限制或敎育兒童以虛僞和勉强；因為中國電影中的童星往往有這種傾向，這是應該特別提出的。還有創作的劇本中，最重要的是應該顧及兒童接受的程度，至少要看得懂受得了，因爲幼稚的腦海和弱小的心靈對社會的瞭解不多；第三，是我們要盡力地發掘和培植兒童的演員，因為我們要想建立兒童的戲劇，而且應該使它成兒童自己的戲劇，而決不是別人的，換句話說。就是要求能够自主。</p>
<p>這一次，中華戲劇研究會在新都劇塲，演出兒童戲劇，是一個很好的消息，雖然因爲時間關係以及劇本演員免不了有些困難，但是我相信努力的幹下去是會有良好收穫的，同時我希望大家來提倡和支持兒童戲劇，使理想的兒童戲劇能早日的建立起來。</p>

<p>上海宜創一崑秦皮黃合演之劇院</p>
<p>據我個人的中張，上海應當創辦一中型劇院，資本不用太多，票價不可太昂，合崑·秦·皮黃三者於一班，每日輪流排其大軸戲，戲碼亦相間排列，座價至多五毛，開鑼即演佳劇，時間約三四小時，廢除案目，茶水聽便，凡不走時而確有根底的角色，均可羅致班中，至於白雲生·侯永奎·馬祥麟·陶顯廷諸人及其班底等只翌加人班中，再能略給以戲份，總比連喝粥都發生問題時强得多了，他們一定是樂意幹的。秦腔的角色，在天津或北平的天橋等處，似乎還能檢選出幾個生旦的傑出人材來，好在梆子班的武戲近來已不多見了，如其要單聽唱工戲的話，不但是班底用不着很多人，即塲面上也不過多用着拉呼呼和打鼓老敲梆子的三人罷了。</p>
<p>倘使這所劇院一旦實現，預料營業必可鼎盛，在觀衆方面固可以極廉之代價，聽得各樣口味不同的戲劇，使耳目一新，同時·崑·秦·皮黃三班的演員們還可以互相砥礪，互相觀摹，不但有保存戲劇之功，抑且有使中國各種地方劇有平均發展之望，有志者試圖之。—（一一六）</p>

<p>話劇在上海的復興，「中旅」在卡爾登的長期公演是有着不可磨滅的功續的。它不但爭取了文明戲的觀衆，也影響了文明戲從業員的演技，如姜明的「魯貴型」及唐若靑對白的尾音，現在已成了一般丑角和旦角的演技課本</p>
<p>抗戰以後，她們離開了上海，而且傳來了許多不幸的消息：如廣　秋和　明的磨擦，廣若育和王遐文的分離。現在前者的消息已經證實，不過分手的兩位　人依然各自守着崗位爲劇運而努力—唐槐秋預　回到上海來，姜明已加入香港的大地影業公司。至於後者，最近的上海報上還見到這對年靑夫婦各奔前程的記載；可是前天，唐若靑和王週文依然很親熱的回到上海來了，這確是一個向關懷他們的觀衆値得報吿的喜訊。</p>
<p>他們此次回到上海來，是伴送「中旅」媽媽吳靜而來的，因為吳靜不慣香港的生活，回到上海來久住，唐若靑和王遐文也乘此機會歸來和上海的朋友們一叙離別之情。筆者昨天在某處碰見了他們夫婦倆，吿訴他們謠傳的消息時，他們笑而不答，其實，這次歸來，就是證明這謠傳的最好答案了。</p>
<p>他們這次在上海躭擱日子很短，不過但底什麽時候走，他們自己都不能確定。並且已經有朋友們和唐若靑情商，請她在這短時期中為某劇院客串一個戲。唐若靑表示，祗要時間許可，一定粉墨登塲。據推測測測，成功的希望佔百分之八十以上。一待時機成熟，筆者將隨時報吿他們的行蹤。</p>

<h3>Another Great Victory for the Chinese Army in Northern Hunan, Advance Troops Have Crossed the Xinqiang River, Recovered Jiangnan Julongmen Factory, Taoshugang, and Maishi; Japanese Troops in Xinqiang, Yanglin, etc., Completely Surrounded</h3>
<p>Miluo: The Japanese troops in northern Hunan have completely collapsed. The Chinese army is pressing towards the south bank of the Xinqiang River. Besides using part of its forces to attack the remnants of the Japanese troops entrenched in Xinqiang Town, Rongjiawan, and Yanglin Street, it has also crossed the Xinqiang River, maneuvering behind the Japanese forces. Now the Japanese in the three locations of Xinqiang Town, etc., have their rear lines cut off by the Chinese and are showing signs of wavering. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Miluo: Hundreds to over a thousand remnants of the Japanese troops who retreated to the south bank of the Xinqiang River, Jiawan, Xinqiang Town, and Yanglin Street, began a fierce battle with the pursuing Chinese army units at dawn on the 7th. Although the remnants of the Japanese stubbornly resisted with their backs to the river, making a last-ditch effort, they have been separately surrounded by the Chinese army and can be completely annihilated soon. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha: On the 7th, the Chinese army in northern Hunan made astonishing progress. The troops pursuing north from Huangshajie and Changlejie have approached the south bank of the Xinqiang River. The troops pursuing north from Pingjiang have also recovered Nanjiang Bridge. The remnants of the Japanese troops at Julongmen Factory on the Pingjiang Shuidao, upstream, have been completely eliminated by the Chinese army. There is no trace of the Japanese on that route, and traffic can pass directly without obstruction. A certain unit continued to advance north from Julongmen Factory and recovered Taoshugang and Maishi. The Japanese facing them showed no will to fight and retreated north in disarray. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha: The Chinese army has been pursuing the remnants of the Japanese troops for days, making rapid progress. Some units have reached areas near Xinqiang and are actively mopping up along the Xinqiang River. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Pingjiang: The Chinese army that occupied Pingjiang, together with a certain unit from Mount Mufu, jointly attacked Nanjiang Bridge north of Pingjiang and recovered the area on the afternoon of the 6th. The Japanese suffered over 300 casualties. The remaining troops retreated in two directions, one retreating north to Shangtashi and Jiuling, and the other retreating northwest to Huanganshi. The Chinese army is following and pursuing them. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Hengyang: This time, the Japanese army's invasion of northern Hunan relied on the appropriate command of the Chinese military authorities to annihilate more than 30,000 people. The good news spread, and all the people rejoiced. The public organizations in Hunan Province sent telegrams to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to pay their respects and also sent telegrams to Commander-in-Chief ×× and the frontline soldiers to pay their respects and offer comfort. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: All parts of China are overjoyed at the victory of the Chinese army in Changsha. A mass parade is being held here to celebrate the victory. Many Chinese people believe that this is the greatest victory of the Chinese side in the War of Resistance, and its importance and scope far exceed the victory of Taierzhuang. Today, military news received here claims that the Chinese army advanced several tens of miles in forty-eight hours in pursuit of the defeated Japanese army. News was also received here that the Japanese army is currently transferring elite units of the Kwantung Army from the three northeastern provinces to Hankou to reinforce. However, it is still unknown whether the Japanese army will decide to attack Changsha or begin to peep into Yichang. It is believed that the current stage of the Changsha campaign is about to end. Some details of the Chinese plan can now be disclosed. It is said that this plan was the result of careful preparation by some of China's most outstanding strategists. These strategists, with clever tactics and the strong morale of the Chinese army, achieved this extraordinary victory. When the Japanese army prepared to attack Changsha, the Chinese side deliberately announced that it would not fight east of the Yuehan Railway and would abandon Changsha. At the same time, the roads and railways near Changsha were systematically and thoroughly destroyed. The elite Chinese army units were stationed in the mountains east of the railway, and particularly strong units were concentrated north of Pingjiang. When the Japanese army moved south towards Changsha, they cut off the railway approaching the rear of the Japanese army and guarded the Chinese army near Dongting Lake and the railway front, moving into the mountains on both sides of the railway and road. When the Japanese army rushed towards Changsha, because the roads and railways had been destroyed by the Chinese army, they left heavy artillery and tanks behind and divided into small teams to rush towards Changsha. This rash action by the Japanese army soon proved to be very costly, as small teams of Japanese soldiers were ambushed and annihilated, and the main force was surrounded in the mountains. The Japanese army had to abandon the invasion of Changsha and flee back, while being attacked by the Chinese army along the way. Most of the Chinese army are from Hunan Province and are very familiar with the local situation and terrain. All circles of Chinese people here praised General Xue Yue, commander-in-chief of the Changsha battlefield, and General Guan Linzheng, commander of the forward troops. The Chinese Army's "Sweeping Report" criticized the situation of the war and said that victory was important economically. It is said that the area around the lakes and swamps in Hunan Province produces 120 million dan of rice and grains annually, and the food supply for the western and northwestern parts of China depends on this. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Residents throughout the city set off firecrackers because of the great victory of the Chinese army in northern Hunan, and the sound resounded throughout the city. This great victory of the Chinese side has dealt a great blow to the Japanese army and shattered their dream of advancing westward. The Japanese side divided the attack on Changsha into three routes, and the momentum was fierce. At first, it was indeed a serious threat to Changsha. However, the Chinese side's front line from Pingjiang through Xinqiang, Miluo, Yingtian to Xiangyin can be counterattacked at any time, or strategically retreated at any time. Therefore, when the Chinese side waited for the Japanese army to rush into its frontal position, it withdrew strong troops to the mountains of the Mufu Mountains and made surprise attacks on the flanks of the southward Japanese army. At the same time, strong and powerful troops were left on the front to deal with them, cutting the Japanese army into countless small groups and annihilating them. According to the Chinese military authorities, the Japanese army's defeat this time was even worse than the defeat in central Hubei. One of the reasons for the Japanese army's defeat this time was that the left wing of the Japanese army acted too slowly. The left wing of the Japanese army originally departed from Xiushui Tonggu in Jiangxi, but because of unfavorable marching, it delayed the opportunity, giving the Chinese army ample time to solve the central and left Japanese armies. (7th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: The remnants of the Japanese troops in Changshou Street northeast of Pingjiang were completely eliminated on the evening of the 6th. A certain unit of the Chinese army had already entered the town on the morning of the 7th. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: The Chinese army east of Nanchang defeated 300 Japanese troops in the southwestern area of the city on the 3rd and continued to advance to the Longchang Bridge area, where they have been facing each other across the river for days. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Changde: The Dongting Lake coast is calm and the Japanese warships have disappeared. They have not dared to move in the past two days. (7th dispatch) London: The Chinese Embassy in London has just received an official telegram from Chongqing stating that the Japanese troops invading Changsha have been driven back 38 miles in the past two days. As a result of the Chinese army's counterattack, the Japanese army has suffered at least 10,000 casualties. (7th Reuters) Hengyang: All circles in Hunan Province believe that the Chinese army's great victory in northern Hunan and northern Jiangxi is of great importance to the overall war situation. All circles in Hunan Province have decided to hold a provincial celebration meeting on the 9th of this month and send telegrams to the whole country to hold it together. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>A certain place in Hubei: A reporter from the Central News Agency paid a visit to General × in a certain place on the front line yesterday morning. Although the general was busy with military affairs, he received him and spoke frankly about the war situation. The general, with his transcendent strategy and ingenious calculations, led to this great victory in northern Hunan and northern Jiangxi. Now, with his permission, his remarks are published as follows: In March of this year, when the Chinese army was fighting in Nanchang and the situation in Hunan was tense, I reported on the military situation in the Changsha All Circles Joint Memorial Weekly and firmly pointed out two key points: (1) From a geographical point of view, Poyang Lake is in northeastern Jiangxi, and Dongting Lake is in northeastern Hunan. The Jiugong Mufu Mountains span the two provinces. From Nanchang to Jiujiang and from Changsha to Yueyang, they are all lake and swamp areas. The Japanese army entering deep into the hinterland is no different from throwing themselves into a trap. We can use the mountains and lakes to create a favorable situation for encircling and annihilating the Japanese army. (2) From the perspective of the overall war situation in the country, we are national revolutionary soldiers and will not worry about the sacrifice of all lives and property, and will not be afraid of the Japanese artillery fire invasion. Moreover, we are afraid that the Japanese will not come to invade Hunan and Jiangxi with heavy troops. The more the Japanese come to invade, the more opportunities we have to gather and annihilate the Japanese army. This is most beneficial to the overall situation of our national war of resistance. Sure enough, since the Japanese army occupied Nanchang, it has not only gained more than it lost militarily, politically, and economically, but has also been exhausted and at a loss for a long time. Until recently, the Japanese army suffered from international isolation and domestic anti-war strikes. At the same time, in view of the fact that they have continued to fight with the Chinese army in northern Hunan, southern Hubei, and northern Jiangxi for several months, they have not achieved any results and cannot survive. They had to make a final struggle to peek at Changsha. This time, the Japanese knew that if they did not concentrate heavy troops to attack Changsha, they would be wiped out. Therefore, starting from September 14, they dispatched six or seven divisions of the army and thousands of naval landing troops, and used a large number of Japanese aircraft and poison gas to launch a bloody battle with the Chinese army. The Chinese army soldiers sprinkled loyal and patriotic blood on the sacred land of national resistance, supporting every inch of the country's territory, and making the Japanese army pay the greatest price and inflict a major blow on the Japanese army. Now the Japanese army is blindly running around in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, trapped in a heavy siege, and it is no different from throwing themselves into a trap and speeding up their defeat and destruction. This is exactly a good opportunity for us to annihilate the Japanese army, and we will surely cause the Japanese army to suffer an unprecedented defeat. However, at this time, there are several important meanings that comrades and compatriots must pay attention to and rise up to implement. First, adhere to the national policy and strategy of resisting the war and building the country. The fundamental purpose of our war of resistance is to seek the eternal survival of the nation and to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. This sacred and arduous mission requires the unity of the whole country, the willingness to make the greatest sacrifices, and a protracted war to control the enemy's lifeline and win the final victory. We can only resolutely, under the leadership of the wise and sacred President, embrace the determination to break the boat and carry out the task of resisting the war to the end, without wavering our will due to any difficulties and hardships, in order to drive out the Japanese army and save the nation. Second, do our best to destroy the Japanese puppet organizations. The enemy's consistent conspiracy is to use puppet organizations as a tool of aggression, the purpose of which is to deceive our people and make them slaves without realizing it. Every one of our people must not forget the blood debts, strictly abide by the National Covenant, stand in the position of the country and the nation, inspire loyalty and righteousness, and defend the territory and sovereignty, and give the enemy puppets a head-on blow everywhere, in order to smash the enemy's conspiracy and eliminate the puppet organizations. Third, all wartime work must be carried out regularly and without interruption. At this critical moment of the War of Resistance, all wartime organizations should be doubly strict, and all wartime work should be doubly intense. All comrades and compatriots should be more loyal and strengthen their spiritual mobilization. All rear production, and the recent launch of the winter clothing fundraising campaign, must be carried out with all efforts to achieve the task of the national war of resistance. In short, our responsibility is not only to defend Hunan and Jiangxi, but also to defend China, not only to drive the Japanese army out of Hunan and Jiangxi, but also to drive the Japanese army out of Chinese territory. I command my armed comrades to vow to live and die with the land we defend, and even if there is one soldier left, we will fight to the end. I hope that my loyal and patriotic comrades and compatriots will not be arrogant in victory, nor discouraged in defeat, be firm and calm, indomitable, and make persistent efforts to turn Hunan and Jiangxi into the graveyard of the Japanese army, and strive for the final victory of the War of Resistance to ensure the eternal survival and independence of the Chinese nation.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>New Understanding of the Battle Situation in Northern Hunan</h3>
<p>The battle in northern Hunan has come to an end recently, and it can be said that China has achieved a great victory surpassing the Battle of Taierzhuang. After a long period of silence in the frontline war, just as the Double Ten Festival of the 28th year is approaching, this good news of victory is like adding glorious celebration materials to China's National Day. Imagine how every Chinese soldier and civilian should rejoice and be encouraged!</p>
<p>The so-called new offensive of the Japanese army has been rumored for a long time. Even before the outbreak of the European War, there were messages about the main attack, the auxiliary attack, the guerrilla attack, and the feint attack flying between China and Japan. Although the Japanese army would never announce in advance where they would attack, it was probably a strategic necessity for them to launch a large-scale offensive in September and October. What's more, since the European War had already broken out in early September, and the complicated relations between international countries were not yet very clear, it was indeed the most appropriate opportunity for the Japanese army to take a new offensive. Generally speaking, the direction of the Japanese army's offensive at the current stage is no more than two: one is to spy on the northwest, and the other is to open up the Yuehan Railway. However, due to the relationship between the front line and the military strength, it is impossible to advance on both roads at the same time, and the outer line of Wuhan is not consolidated. It is impossible to easily risk trying either of these two roads. The so-called Shanxi "mopping-up" battle more than two months ago was obviously a preparation for attacking the northwest; but this preparation work failed, and there is no certainty of attacking the northwest at present. In this battle in northern Hunan, the Japanese army's goal was to capture Changsha, which was obviously carrying out the second attempt, hoping to achieve the initial goal of opening up the Yuehan Railway; moreover, Changsha is fundamentally one of the important strongholds on the periphery of Wuhan. Therefore, even if the Yuehan Railway cannot be opened up in the future, capturing Changsha is still a necessary measure to defend Wuhan. Therefore, this time the Japanese army used elite army divisions such as Saito Iye, Amakasu, Fujita, and Ogisu, combined with naval landing troops, totaling hundreds of thousands, and launched the most fierce offensive from western Jiangxi and northern Hunan at the same time, attempting to occupy Changsha in a short period of time. This shows the importance they attached to this decisive battle. Unexpectedly, the north and south of the Miluo River have always been places where the loyal spirit of Qu Lingjun, the great Chinese national poet, has been widely deepened. This time, it has gathered and annihilated two or three thousand Japanese soldiers, creating a glorious battle record in the history of the nation. Although it cannot be said that China's war of resistance has laid the foundation for victory, the Japanese offensive has been frustrated, and the military strategy that has been prepared for a long time has been shattered, which is certain and undeniable. The national spirit of China should not be underestimated, and the strength of China's war of resistance is growing. In this battle in northern Hunan, the Japanese army should also be taught a lesson from the facts.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the military point of view, it is rumored that the Japanese army's attack on Changsha this time has another political function; although we do not need to speculate on what content the Japanese political function has, any political function has also failed in this decisive battle, or at least cannot be carried out smoothly, which is also undoubtedly obvious.</p>
<p>As for the Chinese side, although the battle in northern Hunan is just one of countless large and small battles in the process of the War of Resistance, and it is also one of many victorious battles; but judging from the nature of this decisive battle, there are also several characteristics that can be recognized: First, Changsha is located on the Dongting Plain. Moreover, it is close to Dongting Lake, and it is very easy to be attacked by the opponent's naval, land, and air forces at the same time. Therefore, from the perspective of the overall situation of the War of Resistance, this place has the possibility of being abandoned; however, this time the Chinese army actually broke the geographical restrictions with heroic bloody battles, not only did it not face the crisis of the enemy approaching the city, but also won a great victory, driving the Japanese army back to the old trenches of the Xinqiang River more than ten months ago, which cannot be denied is a great turning point in the military of the War of Resistance; Moreover, it can also prove that the final victory that has always been called for is not just empty words, but in fact there is a possibility of being realized in advance. Second, since the outbreak of the European War a month ago, the international assistance that China has received is inevitably affected to some extent; however, the Chinese government has repeatedly stated that the War of Resistance is mainly based on self-reliance and will not focus on international assistance. Now it has won a very large victory under such an international environment, which not only confirms that the authorities' statement is not just a consolation, but also enough to encourage the people of the whole country to increase their courage and strengthen their self-confidence, which is of great significance in the continued process of the War of Resistance in the future. Third, since China abandoned Wuhan and Guangzhou, the anti-Japanese army has been thoroughly reorganized, and in the southwest, it has stored very rich new military strength. Whether in terms of personnel or weapons, this battle in northern Hunan can be said to be a "small test of skills" for the new military strength in the southwest. Perhaps the Japanese army also has the meaning of testing the new military strength, but China has indeed won a lot of victories, which shows that the sentence that China's anti-Japanese strength has increased is not a dishonored check, and of course it also has infinite significance in the grasp of the final victory. Fourth, the Japanese army often uses the so-called cone-shaped tactics when attacking an important location, breaking through on the front. In order to avoid sacrifices, the Chinese army often avoids the real and takes the false, and changes to the method of encirclement to attack its sides and backs, but as a result, due to the disparity in military strength, the Japanese army's cone-shaped tactics still work. This time, the Japanese army attacked Changsha and still followed the old trick. The main force advanced fiercely southward along the Yuehan Railway, but the Chinese army's flanking surprise attack tactics unexpectedly worked miraculously, which shows that the situation has changed. From a military and technical point of view, it has gradually turned to the stage favorable to the Chinese army.</p>
<p>In short, the Japanese army regards occupying a large city as an imaginary victory in the war against China. At present, even this kind of illusion is not easy to obtain, which should be a time for them to deeply and keenly reflect!</p>

General Lasiķis, Commander-in-Chief of the Lithuanian Army, and the Director of the Lithuanian Liaison and Ministry of Commerce Trade Department are also representatives of the delegation. People in political circles here are extremely shocked that most of the representatives of the delegation are senior officials of the country. It is learned that, in addition to requesting air bases from Lithuania, the Soviet Union will also request the construction of military bases on the western border of Lithuania, and build a defense project from the Memel border to Kokkenhusen. It is also learned that the Soviet Union also intends to request the stationing of garrison troops in four places on the German border, namely, Marijampolė, Vilkaviškis, Prienai and Tauragnai. The issue of the strength of the garrison troops will be determined by a special agreement. (7th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Riga: According to reliable sources, the Soviet Union intends to send 30,000 people to garrison the air and naval bases in Lithuania that have recently been ceded to the Soviet Union, and to set up fortresses for 40 miles of coastline from Ventspils to the village of Pitteersrags. Ventspils is located on the banks of the Venta River, with modern equipment, and is connected to the railway to Lyubensk. (7th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris: Responsible parties here expect that the Soviet Union and Lithuania will soon conclude a trade agreement. It is said that this agreement will become another link in the encirclement of the Baltic countries and the Soviet Union, and will push Germany behind. It is known that Lithuania's trade has always been with Britain and Germany, with Britain taking the lead. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Favorable Progress in Soviet-Turkish Negotiations; Agreement to Establish Joint Defense of the Black Sea</h3>
<p>London: The "Daily Express" recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in Istanbul, Turkey, stating that Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu is still in Moscow negotiating with Soviet authorities. In the past 24 hours, the situation has greatly improved, and both sides are expected to reach an agreement, which will be signed in the Turkish capital, with the aim of jointly defending the Black Sea. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Moscow: According to news from here today, Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu is likely to remain until Wednesday or Thursday of next week before returning home. According to reliable sources, Britain is unlikely to provide much assistance to Turkey. The Soviet Union is now insisting that Turkey close the Dardanelles Strait when the Soviet Union is drawn into the war, preventing the British and French navies from entering the Black Sea and disrupting the trade route between Germany and the Soviet Union in the Black Sea and the Danube River. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome: According to Rome Radio, Turkish officials claimed that even if the Soviet Union enters the war, Turkey will remain neutral. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland: The latest issue of the German political weekly "Southeastern Echo," which just arrived here today, contains an article on the relationship between Germany and Turkey. Reading it, one immediately understands the anxiety of German officials regarding Turkey's attitude. It states, "It is time for Turkey to decide its attitude. The country's newspapers have recently published hostile editorials on German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Moscow, and its foreign policy also has an anti-German tendency. However, for the sake of laying a solid foundation for peace in Southeastern Europe, the Black Sea region, and the Mediterranean coast, the country's current policy urgently needs to be clarified." (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Improved Relations Between the Soviet Union and Latvia; Exchange of Telegrams Between the Foreign Ministers of the Two Countries; Change of Latvian Chief of Staff</h3>
<p>Moscow: After Latvian Foreign Minister Munters returned to the Latvian capital from Moscow, he sent a telegram to Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov, stating, "This determination to conduct negotiations on the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between the Soviet Union and Latvia has been carried out with a spirit of trust on both sides, and the negotiations have been concluded swiftly and satisfactorily. From now on, the friendship between the Soviet Union and Latvia will become closer, which is deeply gratifying." Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov immediately sent a reply telegram, stating, "The Soviet-Latvian Mutual Assistance Agreement will lay the foundation for lasting peace and promote the welfare of the peoples of the Soviet Union and Latvia." (Haitong, 7th)</p>
<p>Riga: According to an official announcement here, Latvian Chief of Staff General Hartmanis will be transferred to serve under General Kurelis, Commander-in-Chief of the Army. The vacancy will be filled by General Rosenstein. Rosenstein previously served as Deputy Chief of Staff and is currently the principal of the military academy. (Haitong, 7th)</p>

<h3>Prime Minister Daladier Explains French Far Eastern Policy: Aiming to Adapt to the Environment</h3>
<p>Paris: Prime Minister Daladier explained France's policies towards the Soviet Union, Japan, Turkey, the Balkan Peninsula, and neighboring neutral countries to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, stating that these policies are based on the important interests of the country. As for France's current Far Eastern policy, it aims to adapt to the new trends in the current situation. (Havas, 6th)</p>

<h3>Under the Threat of Aggression, Britain and France Will Not Lightly Speak of Peace; Hitler's Suggestions Are Vague and Do Not Help the Overall Situation; British Government Sternly Refutes Slanderous Remarks About Poland; Chamberlain Will Formally Clarify His Attitude</h3>
<p>Paris: The Senate Foreign Affairs Committee met this afternoon, and Prime Minister Daladier attended and delivered a speech with impassioned words, stating, "The goal of Britain and France in going to war is to stop aggression. Regarding France's current foreign policy, I have explained it to the National Assembly Foreign Affairs Committee on the 4th of this month. In short, what Britain and France seek is peace based on respect for the rule of law. Therefore, anyone who seeks hegemony in Europe is not allowed. This kind of peace can only be achieved under the condition of respecting the freedom and rights of all nations. Britain and France will not stop fighting until this goal is achieved." (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>London: Well-informed sources here recently announced that Prime Minister Chamberlain is expected to make a statement to the House of Commons early next week regarding the "suggestions" made by German leader Hitler yesterday. However, the date has not yet been determined. It is likely that he will first deliver a brief speech on Monday (the 9th of this month), and then elaborate on it on Wednesday (the 11th of this month), thereby clearly explaining Britain's attitude. From now until then, the British government will exchange views with the French government and the governments of the various dominions. As for the content of Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech, it can be glimpsed from the semi-official commentary here. In other words, Hitler's speech yesterday did not contain a basis for negotiation. It is evident that Prime Minister Chamberlain will firmly reject the suggestions made by the German side in the name of the British government, the governments of the various dominions, and the French government. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>London: The British government has recently issued a statement refuting the various points made in Hitler's speech, stating that the full text of Hitler's speech in parliament only arrived in London this afternoon, so it has not been studied in detail. The speech is divided into two parts. The first part recounts past events, many of which are contrary to the truth. This point is well known to the people of this country and the world. For example, Hitler's claim that the German side used humane methods in the Polish war has been proven inaccurate by the discussions in the British Parliament and the reports of the British ambassador in Warsaw. Hitler's claim that the Czech people voluntarily requested to be incorporated into German territory does not need to be refuted. Hitler's claim that an Englishman in 1598 spoke of the Poles as cruel and lacking moral concepts, proving that Poland lacks any historical, cultural, or moral basis as a nation, is completely contrary to Hitler's words in parliament on May 21, 1935: "We recognize Poland as a great and patriotic nation-state." Hitler also said that for many years, other countries have imposed on German foreign policy purposes that could only exist in children's imaginations. If other countries have misunderstood Germany, it must have originated from Hitler's openly ambition to dominate the world as stated in "Mein Kampf," as well as Hitler's words and deeds since taking office. Hitler has repeatedly said that the current war was caused by Britain. In fact, Germany has created a dangerous situation in the past two years, while the British government has always worked hard to preserve peace. This fact is universally recognized. The second part of Hitler's speech contains several of what Hitler calls peace proposals. In their current form, these proposals are mostly vague and do not contain any suggestions as to how Germany will compensate for the damage it has inflicted on other countries. However, the British government, as the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary have previously announced, will carefully study this proposal together with the Dominion governments and the French government. But two things must be remembered: (1) A peace proposal cannot be considered acceptable unless it effectively removes Europe from the danger of aggression. (2) The guarantees previously given by the German government have proven to be worthless. Therefore, the trust on which the necessary foundations for peace are based today is not just empty words.

<h3>Hitler's Speech Is Not the Final Suggestion; The Door to Diplomatic Negotiations Is Said to Be Open; If Rejected, He Will Not Shrink from a Fight</h3>
<p>Berlin: Senior Nazi officials claimed last night that if Britain and France feel that Hitler's peace suggestions to the German parliament should be expanded, then Chancellor Hitler would be very willing to do so. After Chancellor Hitler addressed the German parliament, senior Nazi officials hurriedly clarified to foreign journalists that the peace terms outlined by Hitler were not the final suggestions of the German side. The German peace offensive has not stopped. A powerful source in Germany claimed that Chancellor Hitler's "moderate tone" and his disarmament suggestions will elicit a beneficial response from the United States. Chancellor Hitler and other Nazi leaders expressed disappointment at the initial reaction of Britain and France. Nazi officials solemnly declared that regardless of the attitude of Britain and France, Chancellor Hitler does not intend to wait for a complete answer. A German leader claimed, "The European situation is about to be revealed." He said that if Hitler's peace suggestions are rejected, then the German army, navy, and air force will launch a large-scale attack on the Allied forces in the west. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry, in answering the question of what diplomatic steps Germany will take to promote peace, declared today, "A straightforward question also requires a straightforward answer." He pointed out that Hitler has stated that Germany cannot take any further action in the current situation, and that the door to negotiations through normal diplomatic channels is now open without obstruction. (Haitong, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Political circles here attach great importance to Hitler's speech in parliament, believing that Hitler is preparing to engage in diplomatic discussions in order to build peace in Europe. According to general observation, although the procedures for conducting diplomatic discussions have not been announced, the path to reaching an understanding still exists. Since Germany has made suggestions, all parties can make motions and exchange opinions. Regarding the issue of ethnic minorities, the official has not yet issued a document. Currently, there are 650,000 Germans in Hungary, 700,000 Germans in Yugoslavia, 800,000 in Romania, 60,000 Germans in both Lithuania and Latvia, fewer in Estonia, and about 120,000 Germans in eastern Galicia and Ukraine. The Soviet Union and Germany seem to have a plan for cooperation in solving the problem of ethnic minorities. As for the colonial issue, authoritative sources solemnly stated that this is a legitimate and immovable requirement of German foreign policy and has nothing to do with the current disputes or war. Although the colonial issue can be slightly delayed, it must not be ignored. (Haitong, 7th)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of British and French Newspaper Commentary</h3>
<p>London: The "Daily Herald" today criticized Hitler's speech yesterday, saying that if Hitler wants peace, he can express it through action, not just empty words, because his words are of little credibility. Hitler can withdraw his troops in Poland and agree to place the restoration of Poland and Czechoslovakia on the agenda of the proposed great power conference. On this basis, there is a possibility of a real conference. If the conference is only to confirm the gains of his aggression, then there is no peace to speak of. Our principles for joining the war are firm and unshakable by empty promises or threats. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Paris: The newspapers here are very indifferent to the speech delivered yesterday by German leader Hitler, or they express it in a sarcastic tone, and they all believe that Hitler is at a loss and does not know what to do. The "Radical Socialist Party Business News" said that the German leader Hitler has fallen into a dilemma, so he is equivocating. If he puts forward concrete suggestions, he will be rejected by Britain and France, but because the German people have already been bound, he has to mention peace suggestions. Also, because Germany has no allies to rely on, it does not dare to openly threaten democratic countries. As for the establishment of a military alliance treaty between Germany and the Soviet Union, it is absolutely impossible. Stalin has probably explained this to him, and Hitler did not mention it at all." The moderate "Order News" said, "The German leader Hitler advocated convening an international conference, saying that it must be thoroughly prepared in advance. In fact, the method of preparation has been explained in detail by Chamberlain, Daladier, and Halifax. What is the method? It is to eliminate National Socialism. Now, if you want to give an answer to the German leader Hitler, you only need to reiterate the previous proposal." The radical "Socialist Party New Era News" said, "Hitler once said that he does not care about international public opinion, but only cares about German domestic public opinion. This can be said to be shameless, but in fact, the so-called domestic public opinion is just the opinion expressed by him personally." The right-wing "Little Parisian News" said, "The German leader Hitler implicitly advocates a ceasefire first, and then talks. Other than that, there is no concrete suggestion... The German people know that the current war will lead to poverty and a terrible crisis, so the German leader Hitler is eager to end the war to comfort them." The right-wing "Era News" said, "We have heard what the German leader Hitler said five or six times, and we are already very familiar with it... This speech is extremely ordinary and is probably aimed at domestic audiences." The "Paris Echo" said, "The first part of this speech is extremely hateful. If the speaker had any sense of shame, this part alone would be enough to ruin his reputation." (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Different Reactions to Hitler's Speech in Various Countries; American Newspapers Said That Vicious Arguments Do Not Help Peace; Suspicion of Germany Remains Among Neutral Countries; Soviet Union Is Satisfied, Rome's Sympathy Is Expected</h3>
<p>Washington</p>
<p>The "Washington Star" criticized Hitler's speech, saying that peace is no closer as a result of this kind of malicious argument. "The New York Post" said that Hitler's new arguments, with grand words and both promises and threats, are unlikely to be the basis for order in Europe. All sectors here believe that the United States cannot endorse the kind of peace proposed by Hitler, because the United States not only refuses to recognize the fate of Czechoslovakia, but also refuses to recognize the partition of Poland. A peace settlement that makes these two countries vassals of Germany will not be welcomed by the United States. Hitler's remarks about the Soviet Union are entirely wishful thinking, and it seems that German-Soviet relations are actually more friendly, and his remarks about Italy are even more vague, with no mention of Mussolini's military obligations to Hitler. Hitler's demand for the restoration of colonies will be a major step for Britain, but what will Hitler give in return? Other than his guarantee of peaceful intentions, there is no compensation, and this guarantee has already been broken by Germany more than once. A detailed analysis of Hitler's speech does not reveal that Hitler is making any concessions in exchange for his demands. What he seeks is extravagant, and what he is willing to give is nothing. It is known that peace, Germany will greatly benefit from it. However, even if Hitler obtains this great benefit, it seems that he will still not be able to get along with other countries. American senators are not interested in Hitler's speech and believe that it will not have much impact on the progress of the US Neutrality Act debate. President Roosevelt told reporters at his Hyde Park in New York today that he has not yet had the opportunity to read Hitler's speech. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome</p>
<p>Italian people are very supportive of Hitler's speech. Hitler's suggestion to convene an international conference to eliminate political, commercial and military problems related to the interests of the world is praised by people here. Political and diplomatic circles in Rome are waiting for the reaction of Britain and France to the various suggestions for resolving the dispute. Italian newspapers believe that Hitler's speech is another step towards peace. For the sake of saving Europe, Hitler's suggestion is the only way out. (Haitong, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian authoritative sources believe that Hitler's speech is strongly worded, substantive, and constructive. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Moscow</p>
<p>Although the official did not criticize Hitler's speech, there is reason to believe that people here are satisfied with this speech, especially with the firm guarantee of peace in Eastern Europe and the fact that the Soviet Union and Germany independently decided the fate of Poland. The German leader did not mention possible Soviet assistance in the European war, which can be regarded as another sign that the Soviet Union will remain neutral if possible. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Moscow: The speech given by German leader Hitler yesterday was also broadcast here. Political figures in Moscow initially commented that Hitler's peace suggestions were accurate and clear, and also based on the spirit of the Soviet-German agreement. All circles paid special attention to the cooperation between the Soviet Union and Germany in transforming the order of Eastern Europe. Moscow newspapers have not yet published comments today, but they will be available tomorrow. (Haitong, 7th)</p>
<p>Neutral Countries</p>
<p>Paris: The various neutral countries responded to the speech given yesterday by German leader Hitler with extreme suspicion. This can be seen in the newspapers. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Dutch newspaper "Maasbode" stated that "Leader Hitler already feels that the bet he has made is very large and shows embarrassment. As for the attack on Poland, it is surprising that a great nation like Germany would impose this kind of argument on a defeated enemy."</p>
<p>(2) Swiss newspapers generally said that "this speech is not credible." The "Bern Defender" stated that "this is not a peace suggestion, but only a self-defense by the country to the people of the world. Leader Hitler has already tied himself up."</p>
<p>(3) The Romanian capital's "Universal News" stated that "Hitler is eager to end the war as soon as possible, and his feelings are overflowing." Other newspapers said that the content of the speech did not contain concrete peace suggestions.</p>
<p>(4) Newspapers in the Yugoslavian capital generally said that it is difficult for the two Allied countries, Britain and France, to trust Hitler, and Hitler's remarks are also difficult for those countries to believe.</p>
<p>(5) Newspapers in the Bulgarian capital stated that Hitler did not make concrete peace suggestions.</p>
<p>(6) Turkish newspapers commented extensively. The semi-official "Ulus" newspaper stated that Hitler's suggestions "should not be accepted. Germany has not given an inch and is still greedy. Now, the guarantees it provides to France are almost the same as those it provided to Czechoslovakia and Poland." (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo</p>
<p>Japanese newspapers criticized Hitler's speech, believing that Britain and France may not seriously consider the German leader's peace suggestions. "Dokuritsu News" said that it is doubtful whether Britain and France will accept the international conference. It is expected that Britain and France will continue to fight until Poland is restored to its satisfaction. "Daily News" said that Chamberlain has repeatedly expressed distrust of Hitler and does not need to accept the suggestion now. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Today's "Japan Times" criticized Hitler's speech, saying that Germany has now completed its occupation of Poland. If peace can be established on the basis of this accomplished fact, it will be a great victory for Germany. In his speech, Hitler announced that if Britain and France reject Germany's peace construction, they will bear the responsibility for prolonging the European war. This declaration may stimulate the German people to fight Britain and France with redoubled efforts, but what we worry about is that this declaration may not be able to shake the established goals of the Allied countries. Now that things have come to this point, even great politicians cannot end the European war in a short period of time. Some events beyond human power will drive the European war to a painful conclusion. (Reuters)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Ignores Hastening to Mediate the European Situation; Must First Obtain the Consent and Guarantee of Britain and France</h3>
<p>Washington: According to Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, President Roosevelt is willing to do his part for peace in Europe when the time is ripe. However, the president can only take action when the warring parties have a clear expression of willingness to coordinate. Before this intention of the warring countries is expressed, any expression by the president will be regarded by the warring countries as an intrusive intervention. Only when the conditions are met will President Roosevelt be willing to act as a mediator. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington: Government officials here are unwilling to criticize reports from Berlin that the United States and other neutral countries will support Hitler's peaceful posture. Observers here believe that this news is not reliable. Unless Britain and France are willing to use Hitler's suggestions as the basis for negotiations, the United States will not act arbitrarily, and what the United States can do is only friendly mediation. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to General Goering's organ, "Essen National News," the United States may be able to support Hitler's peace suggestions, and the Soviet Union may also be able to make efforts for European peace. In order to promote peace, Germany is very willing to accept a ceasefire in order to convene an international conference to engage in peace negotiations. Germany is willing to accept the current situation in Europe. Germany's future demands are only on the return of the colonies. It also said that Mussolini, Franco, and the Pope will soon launch a peace movement. As for President Roosevelt, because he is the leader of a neutral country, he is most suitable as a mediator.

<h3>Hitler's Speech Has No Impact on the US; No Change in General Sentiment in the US Senate</h3>
<p>Washington - Hitler's speech in the German Reichstag yesterday had no impact on the US congressional debate on amending the Neutrality Act. Nebraska Republican Senator Norris said, "I have no trust in Hitler. He has lied too many times. Every time he gains something, he claims he has no further territorial ambitions." Prominent isolationist Bora said, "We don't believe either side's words." The youngest isolationist Senator Holt said, "This is just another European problem. No matter how they solve it, it will only lay a foundation for the next great war." Utah Democratic Senator King said he firmly believes that the Soviet Union and Germany will cooperate to destroy all democratic countries. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington - According to Dow Jones News Service, the informal poll of senators' sentiments shows that senators have not changed their opinions since the Senate began debating the government's Neutrality Act amendments, including repealing the arms embargo, on Monday. If the Senate were to vote today, the count would be 55 in favor of repeal, 31 against, and 10 abstaining or absent. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington - Yesterday, the Pittman Bill was introduced in the US Senate for discussion. Isolationists spoke out in opposition. For example, Senator Danahey stated that if the Pittman Bill were passed, various dangers could arise and said that this bill runs counter to US neutrality. (Haitong Electric, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Recalls Ambassador to Germany</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese government announced yesterday the recall of Lieutenant General Hiroshi Oshima, the Japanese ambassador to Germany. This move is another blow by the Japanese government to those who advocate Japan joining the Rome-Berlin Axis. Well-informed sources claim that Lieutenant General Hiroshi Oshima was the strongest advocate for concluding a military alliance with Germany and Italy. His replacement will be Saburo Kurusu, the Japanese ambassador to Belgium. It is widely believed that Kurusu belongs to the faction of the Japanese diplomatic corps that is inclined towards democratic countries. His appointment can be seen as a sharp rebuke to the young officers in Japan who advocate concluding a military alliance with the European Axis powers. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japan Purchases Large Quantities of Kerosene from the US</h3>
<p>Green Cedar City, USA - California's four major kerosene companies, namely General Kerosene Company, United Kerosene Company, Richfield Kerosene Company, and Mobil Kerosene Company, have recently signed a contract with the Japanese government to supply the country's navy with more than 3 million barrels of kerosene. This kerosene will be shipped from here in batches over the next three months. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>US Sends Warship to Protect Merchant Ships; USS Iroquois Warned by Germany</h3>
<p>Washington - The Navy Committee announced yesterday that the crew of the USS Iroquois had received instructions from the White House to navigate with extra caution. Presidential Secretary Early confirmed yesterday that German Admiral Raeder had his naval attaché sign the warning he sent to the US. Another report said that Admiral Raeder obtained this information from Ireland, but this could not be confirmed. Admiral Raeder warned the US government that the USS Iroquois, carrying American citizens back to the US, would suffer the same fate as the Athena, being bombed by the British or French. President Roosevelt said in a speech at Hyde Park that providing military escort to the Iroquois would not be set as a precedent, and that the same protection would be provided for every American vessel. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>London - An official statement issued here today stated that the British Admiralty has taken note of Berlin's statement that the American ship Iroquois will also be sunk in circumstances similar to those encountered by the Athena. It was found that those rescued from the Athena, which was sunk by a German submarine, clearly witnessed the German submarine. There were no British submarines within hundreds of miles at the time. Therefore, the German government's current statement makes Britain understand and measure the criminal psychology of the National Socialist leaders even more clearly. However, it is surprising that naval officers of the German Imperial era, such as the current head of the German Navy, Admiral Raeder, are willing to associate with them and demean their reputation. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Hyde Park, New York - President Roosevelt told reporters here today that the US dispatching naval vessels to protect the American ship Iroquois (according to the commander-in-chief of the German Navy, the ship will be bombed when approaching the United States) is a good example of the US Navy patrol operating in the Atlantic. When asked if this was a precedent for warships escorting other American ships, President Roosevelt replied "Yes" and said that neutral patrol ships are already at sea, so protecting the Iroquois is even easier. According to reports, the Iroquois is carrying 584 American passengers from Europe. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Mexican Mechanics Repair Submarine, Violating Neutral Rights</h3>
<p>Mexico City - It is rumored that two skilled mechanics from the postal ship Columbus have been away from the ship for two days repairing the diesel engine of a submarine near the coast. Although the Mexican authorities have removed the ship's radio equipment, it is believed that the ship may still have a small one. If the above incident is confirmed, the ship will be in violation of neutral rights and will be forced to leave overseas within 24 hours. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

It was originally scheduled to fly via Madrid to Paris, London, and Rome. It is now planned to take off from Dakar and fly via Agadir, Casablanca, and Seville in Morocco to Rome. On its way back to Japan, the aircraft will visit Syria. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<h3>New US Fighter Planes Supplied to Britain and France</h3>
<p>Green Cedar City, USA - A total of 250 of the latest fighter planes ordered by Britain and France from the United States will be manufactured and stored in warehouses before the end of this year.

Manufacturers have received advance notices from agents, asking them to continue manufacturing as usual and wait for the special session of Congress to amend the current Neutrality Act.

<h3>US Far East Trade Volume Sharply Increased Compared to Before</h3>
<p>New York - Within two weeks of the outbreak of the European war, the number of long-distance telephone calls between the United States and the Far East has increased by 50% compared to before. This can be regarded as a sign of extraordinary prosperity in trade. As for long-distance telephone calls and telegrams between Europe and the United States, although they are strictly checked by the authorities in certain European countries, their turnover has more than doubled compared to before the war. The turnover of domestic telegrams in the United States has also increased by 25% to 30%. In addition, the turnover of long-distance telephone calls between the United States and South American countries has more than doubled compared to before.

<h3>Internal Strife in Japanese Foreign Ministry; Nomura Compromise Plan Adopted, Accepts Subordinate's Suggestions</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese government has decided to appoint Foreign Minister Nomura with full authority to handle the turmoil in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Foreign Minister hopes to find a way to resolve it peacefully. The opinions of various newspapers and the public have gradually become more critical of the lack of discipline of the resigning personnel. The Yomiuri Shimbun reported that the attitude of the young officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is regrettable and praised Prime Minister Abe and Foreign Minister Nomura for insisting that the cabinet's plan should not be changed. The Miyako Shimbun stated that this dispute is actually a struggle for power and said that the whole country will support the Foreign Minister's decisive handling of this turmoil. Some observers here believe that Foreign Minister Nomura will not resign because of this incident, but the positions of Gaima Masano, and other senior officials will inevitably be shaken. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - More than 300 lower-ranking officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted their resignations in opposition to the Foreign Minister's decision to establish a Ministry of Trade. At the same time, they also sent 18 representatives to meet with Foreign Minister Nomura. It is heard that Nomura, in order to calm the situation, has submitted a compromise plan to the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and encouraged them to abide by the discipline of civil servants. It is said that although this compromise plan has accommodated the opinions of the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the establishment of the Ministry of Trade will still not be changed. According to officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, matters relating to diplomatic negotiations should be under the control of the Commercial Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but now the cabinet has decided that they should be under the control of the Ministry of Trade. Therefore, the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believe that it violates precedent. However, it is heard that the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may be able to accept this compromise plan. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>

<h3>German Troops on the Western Front Begin Fierce Counteroffensive; Attempt to Recapture the Warndt Forest Area; British Expeditionary Force Continues to Arrive in France</h3>
<p>Paris - Yesterday, in order to respond to Prime Minister Hitler's address to the German Reichstag, the German army on the Western Front launched a fierce counteroffensive against the French army, attempting to drive out the French army within the range of the German artillery in the "Siegfried" line southwest of Saarbrucken. The German army launched an attack on the French outposts, concentrating their efforts on the French positions on the south bank of the Saar River between Saarlouis and Saarbrucken. Germany attempted to destroy the French artillery on the small hill of Paulus in Saarlouis, but the French army resisted fiercely. The German army also attempted to reoccupy the Warndt Forest area before the French army consolidated the Bati there. French authorities stated yesterday that after German troops arrived by train from Bohemia, Moravia, and Poland in the Black Forest, they rushed to the "Siegfried" front opposite the Saar area. They had anticipated that the German army would launch a large-scale counteroffensive in an attempt to recover the lost territory. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>London - British Expeditionary Force troops are currently traveling day and night to France to fight alongside the Allied French forces on the front lines. These troops have not encountered any obstacles or casualties while crossing the English Channel. This is all due to the proper dispatch of the transportation department. Prime Minister Chamberlain mentioned this when he reported to the House of Commons yesterday on the first month of combat after the start of the war. In addition, the authorities have heard that domestic reporters will be allowed to accompany the expeditionary force to the front lines in the short term to report on the war. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Paris - General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 65, stating, "Our outpost units had contact in many places on the front line today. Enemy units attacked our positions northwest of Wissembourg and were repulsed." (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Paris - General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 66, stating, "Both sides' scouting units were at certain places on the front line, it is permitted to reconnoiter southwest of Saarbrucken." (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Paris - The view held by military observers here that the future offensive of the German army on the Western Front will be launched on the front of the Maginot Line seems to be gaining strength. As winter is approaching rapidly, Hitler will not attempt to break through the muddy plains of Flanders or invade Switzerland and create new enemies for himself. Although the French army occupies a large area of German territory, and no German soldiers are in French territory, this point has a negative impact on the vanity of Germany. Hitler, motivated by prestige, may attack the area between the Rhine and the Moselle. The French army has fortified the recently captured points in this area. The German army must first break through this terrible obstacle before it can reach the main fortifications of the Maginot Line. According to the Reuters military reporter, after France repeatedly launched surprise attacks, it has now estimated the forest of Bogue. The strategic importance of this forest cannot be overestimated. The French army has also advanced to the wooded highlands around Wasch and Zierges, all of which are highlands that can serve as the main positions overlooking the Saar River. The rumor that Germany has giant new tanks may be an exaggeration. All countries have tested cruiser-type tanks, and British cruiser-type tanks may be better than those of other countries. However, these heavy weapons must be equipped with towing seats, so their practicality is reduced accordingly. The recent French battle report stated, "Light infantry is quite active in many parts of the front, and the enemy's attack on a French sentry position in the area west of Wissembourg has been repulsed. British Commander-in-Chief Sir Ironside and Air Chief Marshal Newell met with French General Gamelin, General Vuillemin, and General Georges today to discuss current combat methods. This decisive meeting reiterated the complete consensus of opinions between the two commanders. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

The German Air Force suffered no losses. (Haitong Electric, 7th)</p>
<h3>British and French Air Forces Cooperate Smoothly</h3>
<p>Paris - Air Chief Marshal Newall of the British Air Force made a statement to the press here this morning, stating that since the beginning of the war, British Air Force units have been stationed at various bases in France for several weeks. British bombers and fighters have also arrived one after another, almost every day. Some of them operate independently, while others cooperate with the French Air Force. This is the same smooth cooperation as between the two countries' navies and armies. The British troops have been warmly received by the French residents wherever they have gone, which is deeply appreciated. The British planes that have arrived in France are actually the advance units of the British Expeditionary Force. The activities of the British planes will be considered and allowed for the press to visit. In addition, the staff offices of the British and French armies and air forces recently held a meeting to discuss the details of combat operations, so that the efficiency of cooperation between the two sides can reach its peak. From now on, meetings will be held frequently. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle at Chen Village, Lingshou, Hebei</h3>
<p>Luoyang - The long-dormant war situation in central Hebei saw a major victory for the Chinese army near Lingshou at the end of last month. A bloody battle lasting three days and nights resulted in the annihilation of over 2,000 Japanese soldiers, a feat rarely seen in recent campaigns in central Hebei. The Japanese troops of the Kuwata unit, numbering over 1,700, stationed in Chen Village northwest of Lingshou, were encircled and fiercely attacked by a certain Chinese unit in a mobile maneuver on the morning of September 27th. After a day and night of intense fighting, the Japanese troops, unable to withstand the onslaught, retreated towards Gaojia Village and the area east and southeast of Sijia Village (both located southeast of Chen Village). The Chinese army pursued them relentlessly, preventing any escape, and surrounded the Japanese troops again at Gaojia Village. After another day and night of fighting, on the morning of the 29th, over 400 Japanese soldiers from Ciyu and over 200 from Xingtang attempted to reinforce the besieged troops via different routes, but were ambushed by the Chinese forces in advance and annihilated midway. The Japanese then dispatched several aircraft to cover their breakout, but the Chinese army lured them to the Nanshan area and, after a bloody half-day battle, completely annihilated them. In this battle, in addition to capturing over 500 rifles and pistols, 23 light and heavy machine guns, and a large quantity of other military supplies, over 50-60 Japanese and puppet soldiers were captured alive. The Japanese troops in Shijiazhuang, Lingshou, Jingxing, and other places are reportedly in extreme panic upon hearing of this successive defeat. (7th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in Shandong Province Transferred to Central China to Participate in the Invasion of Hunan; Over 2,000 Have Withdrawn Successively; Passenger Ticket Sales Suspended on the Jiaoji Railway</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence - After the outbreak of the battle in northern Hunan, the Japanese troops originally stationed in Shandong Province to carry out the so-called "mopping-up of guerrilla areas" were ordered to concentrate in Central China, intending to participate in the invasion of Changsha. In recent days, over 2,000 Japanese troops have withdrawn successively from Shijiu. Many Japanese warships have arrived in Qingdao, carrying Japanese troops out of the port daily, in varying numbers. Passenger ticket sales on the Jiaoji Railway have been suspended. There is also talk that the Qingdao Customs may cease operations. The Chinese army in southeastern Shandong is becoming increasingly active. The Japanese troops within the territory of Pingdu in Shandong have been annihilated, making it, along with the three counties of Laiyang, Haiyang, and Qixia, a complete area of eastern Shandong. One day, a train carrying Japanese soldiers heading east on the Jiaoji Railway was blown up by Chinese guerrillas while passing through Zhoucun, killing and wounding 70-80 Japanese soldiers.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Guangdong Province Attacks Shenzhen; Shenzhen Has Long Been Surrounded; Fighting is Quite Intense</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence - The Chinese army in Guangdong Province has long been preparing to attack the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line, launching an offensive against Shenzhen and Nantou in its southern section starting on the night of September 30th. From 10 p.m. that night, intense artillery fire, dense gunfire, and hand grenade explosions were heard from the border area. According to a cook who escaped from the Japanese side in Shenzhen after being captured, multiple Chinese plainclothes soldiers suddenly appeared in Shenzhen around 10 p.m. that night. One group launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops, all carrying hand grenades and pistols, putting the Japanese in a very embarrassing situation, causing them to flee in disarray. Another group immediately set fires everywhere as a signal, and the Chinese counter-attacking forces began to move, bombarding Shenzhen with artillery and attacking the Japanese troops there simultaneously. It is also said that the total number of Japanese troops in Shenzhen is around 1,500.</p>
<p>During the Chinese army's attack on Shenzhen, another unit attacked Nantou, simultaneously cutting off the communication lines between the Japanese troops in Nantou and Shenzhen. All bridges on the highway from Shenzhen to Nantou were destroyed to prevent Japanese troops in Nantou from reinforcing Shenzhen. During this period, the Chinese army surrounded Shenzhen and launched a fierce attack on the area, forcing a small number of Japanese troops in Shatoujiao to withdraw. It is said that there were no Japanese troops in Shatoujiao on the 1st of this month, but the exact situation inland is still unknown. According to someone who observed the battle situation on a hilltop on the New Territories border on the morning of the 1st, around 2 p.m. in the afternoon, five Japanese aircraft were seen circling outside Shenzhen and dropping bombs. Each bomb explosion caused smoke and earth to rise from the ground, reaching several dozen feet high, with extremely loud explosions. The explosions of the shells fired by the Chinese army at the Japanese troops were also clearly visible. The artillery battle between the two sides was extremely fierce, with one shell fired every minute. On that day, Japanese aircraft dropped as many as a hundred bombs. Based on the locations where the Japanese aircraft dropped their bombs, it appears that the Chinese attacking forces have approached the vicinity of Shenzhen, and the fighting is becoming increasingly intense.</p>
<p>The British border is currently guarded by Indian troops. When Japanese aircraft approach the British border, the British army is on high alert. The Indian troops prohibit nearby residents from approaching the border and drive away those watching from the hilltops.</p>
<h3>Anti-British Movement Another Step by the Japanese Army in North China; Churches and Hospitals Are Devastated; British Staff Members Are Also Detained</h3>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Peiping dated September 27th in the English-language "China Press," four staff members of the English church hospital in Hejian were killed by Japanese soldiers, two nurses were raped, and three British staff members were also detained by Japanese soldiers. Two church hospitals in Hejian and Datong in Shanxi Province have been forcibly taken over by Japanese soldiers. These attacks are another step in the anti-British movement instigated by the Japanese in North China. Many churches and hospitals have withdrawn due to the anti-British movement endangering the lives of staff and patients. A large number of churches and hospitals in parts of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces have been forced to close. Only a few congregations are still operating. Two English church schools in Peiping have also been forced to close due to the anti-British movement.</p>
<h3>Eighth Route Army Recovers Anguo and Boye Counties; 10,000 Japanese Troops Rushed to Reinforce, but Were Ambushed</h3>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Baoding dated September 29th in the English-language "China Press," the Eighth Route Army intensified its operations, defeating the Japanese army last night and recovering the two major cities of Anguo and Boye, located 260 miles from Peiping. According to visitors from the battlefront, the Eighth Route Army moves unpredictably. The troops fought fiercely with the Japanese garrison in the area for three days, killing at least 700 Japanese soldiers and wounding 1,200. The fighting is still ongoing. 10,000 Japanese troops from Baoding and Dingxian rushed to reinforce, but were intercepted by the Eighth Route Army and divided into two sections before being ambushed. No fewer than fourteen Japanese trucks were burned in Hancun, not far from Anguo. The Eighth Route Army attacked Anguo directly from three sides. Only a few of the 2,000 Japanese troops stationed in the city managed to break through and flee to Baoding and Dingxian.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Jiaxing Briefly Reached the City Walls; Japanese Troops Strictly Search Passengers at the Railway Station and Wharf</h3>
<p>Jiaxing Correspondence - The Chinese army, which arrived here from the south bank of the Qiantang River a few days ago, launched a fierce attack on the city in conjunction with the garrison from ××. A fierce battle took place with the Japanese troops in the Nanyan area (only two li from the city). After an hour of intense fighting, the Japanese troops, due to their weak forces, retreated into the city. The Chinese army advanced to the vicinity of the railway station. Subsequently, due to the arrival of Japanese reinforcements, the Chinese army retreated. To defend against the Chinese army, the Japanese troops have recently deployed soldiers to strictly search passengers at the train and boat wharfs. A man named Xu Ziqiao, who has been engaged in the grain business in Tangwan Town, recently gathered silk merchants in Shanghai to set up a factory in Tangwan to purchase cocoons due to the silkworm season. Xu traveled between Jiaxing and Shanghai to manage the business. However, a few days ago, when he brought over a thousand yuan from Shanghai to Jiaxing, he was intercepted and searched by Japanese soldiers at the railway station. The Japanese soldiers pointed out that the occupation listed on Xu's "Good Citizen Certificate" and "Pass" did not match, so he was arrested and repeatedly tortured, resulting in serious injuries. Subsequently, with the help of relatives and friends, a large sum of money was spent to secure his release. Because the troops of Xu Pucheng, the puppet pacification commander, had not been paid for three months, they have been defecting to the Chinese army authorities in ×××, bringing their weapons with them. Yesterday, six puppet soldiers surrendered with twelve rifles and were settled by a high-ranking officer who also rewarded them with 100 yuan in cash each.</p>
<p>The Japanese authorities here have recently sent traitorous merchants to various rice shops disguised as brokers to purchase new rice in order to replenish Japan's food shortage, causing rice prices to rise daily. It is said that the Chinese army authorities have ordered the garrisons in various places to strictly prohibit the import of agricultural products into the occupied areas.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Announces Revised School System Chart</h3>
<p>(Special Chongqing Dispatch) The school system was first announced by the Ministry of Education in the 11th year of the Republic of China (1922) and amended by the National Education Conference in the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928). At the National Education Conference in March of this year, the Ministry of Education, taking into account practical needs, revised the school system. The revised resolution was passed. The main points of this resolution were published in this newspaper. The Ministry of Education has announced the revised school system chart and related explanations, which are extracted below:</p>
<p>(A) Revised School System Chart I</p>
<p>(B) Various Resolutions and Explanations</p>
<p>(1) Within the secondary education stage, in addition to the existing 3-3 system secondary schools, a six-year secondary school will be established, without separation of junior and senior high school. Its curriculum will be determined separately. To encourage talented students from poor families to receive education, the six-year secondary school should provide more scholarships.</p>
<p>(Explanation) The original purpose of establishing secondary schools was primarily for further education, but the current 3-3 system secondary school cannot fully meet this requirement. In fact, many students entering junior and senior high school do not consider whether they can continue their education after graduation, resulting in a serious problem of what to do after graduation. In order to take into account practical needs, a six-year integrated secondary school is established, specifically for preparing for further education. Students in the original 3-3 system secondary school who cannot continue their education will be given various types of training so that they can find employment after graduation (see the Secondary Education Improvement Plan for details).</p>
<p>(2) In addition to establishing simple normal school courses, the original 3-3 system junior high school may also establish simple vocational courses to recruit junior high school graduates.</p>
<p>(3) Within the higher education stage, in addition to the existing two-year and three-year vocational schools, a five-year vocational school will be established, mainly focusing on art and music. It will recruit junior high school graduates and students with equivalent academic qualifications. (Explanation) The current vocational schools recruit high school graduates and students with equivalent academic qualifications, but in fact, because most high school graduates go on to universities, recruitment is difficult. However, junior high school graduates who want to receive vocational training have no schools to enter. In order to increase the function of vocational schools and meet practical needs, a five-year vocational school will be established to recruit junior high school graduates and students with equivalent academic qualifications, providing them with five years of integrated vocational training.</p>
<h3>Key Points for Implementing Required and Elective Courses for Various Departments of Universities Recently Announced by the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>(Special Chongqing Dispatch) The Ministry of Education recently announced the key points for implementing the table of required and elective courses for various departments of universities. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry-approved table of required and elective courses for various departments of universities should be implemented by all institutions starting from the second year of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939). At the end of the academic year, they should submit the teaching syllabus for each course set up in accordance with the table. In the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), the third and fourth grades should, as far as possible, refer to the Ministry-approved course table to set up required and elective courses.</p>
<p>(2) Departments composed of two combined disciplines, such as mathematics and physics, history and geography, philosophy and psychology, history and sociology, political science and economics, etc., may be taught in groups, with common and group-specific required and elective courses. Each institution should refer to the previously issued course tables for each department and submit them to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<p>(3) For departments for which required and elective course tables have not yet been promulgated, such as journalism, surveying, railway management, etc., each institution should formulate temporary course tables and submit them to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<p>(4) Party principles, physical education, and military training are, of course, required courses. In addition to setting them up in the first year, all departments from the second year onwards must still set up physical education and military training courses in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>(5) Students in the departments of the Colleges of Arts, Sciences, Commerce, and Agriculture, and the three departments of Political Science, Economics, and Sociology of the College of Law must complete at least 132 credits. Students in the departments of the College of Engineering and the Department of Law of the College of Law must complete at least 142 credits before they can graduate.

<p>(6) The academic year and semester for the required courses listed in the required course table may be adjusted by each institution for convenience in scheduling, unless the order of the contents cannot be changed due to their sequential nature.</p>
<p>(7) The number of credits for each course listed in the required course table is the minimum and must not be reduced. Each institution may increase the number of credits depending on the available personnel and facilities.</p>
<p>(8) If necessary, each institution may, in addition to the Ministry-approved required courses for each department, add departmental or group-specific required courses, taking into account practical needs and available facilities, but this must be submitted to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<p>(9) The academic year, semester, and credits for the elective courses in each department may be changed by each institution for convenience in scheduling.</p>
<p>(10) Each institution may set up its own elective courses in addition to the Ministry-approved elective courses, but they must not exceed one-quarter of the total credits for elective courses in that department, and this must be submitted to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<p>(11) At the beginning of each academic year, each institution should, in accordance with the Ministry-approved course table, list the names, credits, and semesters of the required and elective courses set up in each department and report them to the Ministry for record.</p>
<p>(12) After the promulgation of the Ministry-approved course table, each institution must implement it. Graduating students who have not completed the required courses and met the required number of credits for each course will not be allowed to graduate.</p>

<h3>In Yesterday's Soccer Game, the East Celle Defense Was Shattered; Lido Scored Five Goals in a Row; Sun "Iron Leg" Took Care of Everything</h3>
<p>The Westerners' Football League is about to begin next week. Yesterday and today's friendly matches were extremely popular, with a total of five games. The main match at the Zhendan Stadium was Lido versus East Celle. Lido defeated the British team with a score of 5-0. East Celle had previously defeated St. Francis with a score of 8-2, so they had garnered attention from fans. Their strength must be far greater than in previous years. Unexpectedly, in yesterday's match against Lido, all of their weaknesses were exposed. Sun "Iron Leg" scored five goals alone, a rare achievement. Lido missed countless opportunities, otherwise, the score would have been far greater. Yesterday, the Zhendan Stadium had over three thousand spectators, and the atmosphere was lively. In the first game, Zhendan and the East Celle reserve team ended in a 1-1 draw.</p>

<h3>Lacks Wins Against North Xitong</h3>
<p>In a friendly soccer match, Lacks played against North Xitong. The game started at 2:30 p.m. yesterday at Yiyuan, and lasted for 70 minutes. North Xitong had just been promoted from Group B to Group A this season, and their experience was relatively poor. The center back was Parker, a former star of the French Business Association.</p>
<p>This season was his first appearance, and his footwork was unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Lacks' performance also lacked coordination. Star player Fafan only played for half the game. In the first half, Lacks took a 2-1 lead. In the end, Lacks defeated North Xitong 5-3.</p>
<p>St. Portuguese Ties Three Goals Each</p>
<p>In another friendly match, St. Francis played against Portugal.</p>
<p>The game was held at the American Middle School yesterday afternoon. In the first half, Portugal took a 3-2 lead. In the second half, St. Francis scored one goal, while Portugal scored none. The result was a 3-3 draw. The reserve teams of St. Francis and Lacks competed at the same time at the Jinke Middle School Stadium. As a result, Francis won against Lacks. In the first half, the score was 1-0, with the St. team leading. This afternoon at 3 p.m., Lido will play against West Force again. There will still be a double match at the Zhendan Stadium.</p>
<p>There are still four soccer friendly matches to be played today. Lido will play against West Force at 3 p.m. at the Zhendan Stadium. The two teams played a match before, and the result was a 1-1 draw, so they can be called evenly matched. This time they have decided to meet again. Lido, riding the momentum of yesterday's victory over East Celle, will definitely be able to defeat the enemy. It is expected that the battle will be more intense than before. Before the game, the West Police team will play against the Sookel team. The West Police team is making its first appearance this season, but they should be able to handle the mediocre Sookel team with ease. Tickets are the same as yesterday, still selling for 7 cents (including refugee donation). At 10:30 a.m., the French Business Association will play against St. Francis. The French Business Association has few people this season and is likely not an opponent for the St. team.

<h3>Finance Export Trade Increases, Foreign Exchange Gradually Loosens</h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange Market Yesterday: HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The unofficial exchange rates for British and American currencies remained stable, mainly because of the recent major victories of the Chinese army at the front lines, and reports of military victories near Nanchang. Therefore, many parties were cautious. Telegrams from Hong Kong and Sassoon successively offered to sell foreign exchange. Additionally, according to recent customs statistics, there were large exports of silk, tea, and eggs, leading to more sellers offering foreign exchange. However, foreign banks like HSBC had good appetite for absorbing these offers, so the market's loosening trend was缓和. The highest buying price for British gold by major banks was 士 five six two five at 四辦, and for US dollars it was seven yuan six two five. However, the afternoon closing prices were 士 five one five six two five at 四辦, and seven yuan five six two five, respectively. Consequently, the British rate was looser than the American rate, influenced by the continued slight decrease of one and a half points in the US-to-UK exchange rate. The trends for October and November were mixed, but overall, they were slightly extended. According to the afternoon closing prices, the distance between British gold for October and November was 〇七八一二五, and the difference for US dollars was 一五六二五, approximately equal to a monthly interest rate (excluding commissions) of only 二分 one 釐. However, in reality, it was difficult for arbitrageurs to profit. Trading was flat throughout the day.</p>
<p>Sassoon Continues to Offer</p>
<p>Early in the morning, London's main market saw a sharp increase of 一辦士 three five in both near and far-term rates. New York silver prices rose 一二五. London bullion remained stable. Exchange rates for British currency against US, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. US currency decreased by 一分 half against British currency, remained unchanged against Shanghai currency, and decreased slightly by 一二五 against French currency. Central Bank listed rates for all currencies remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling prices in the morning: British gold at 士 four six eight seven five at 四辦, and US dollars at seven yuan half, with no gains or losses compared to the previous closing. After opening, Hong Kong first sent a telegram offering to sell, and Western merchant Sassoon followed suit. Therefore, the situation was stable with a firm undertone. It is estimated that Hong Kong telegram and Sassoon sold spot British gold at 士 half at 四辦, and spot US dollars at seven yuan five three 一二五 and five six 二五 to a certain bank. Later, after HSBC's listed rates were announced as unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was announced at 大七分, foreign firms pawned off spot US dollars at seven yuan five three 一二五 to a certain bank. However, exporters frequently offered to sell soon after, so the situation was stable with a firm undertone. It is estimated that exporters sold spot British gold at 士 half and five six 二五 at 四辦, and sold spot US dollars from seven yuan five six 二五 to six 二五 to foreign banks like Chase Bank and Banque de l'Indochine. Subsequently, the selling trend gradually subsided, causing the situation to become increasingly calm. By the afternoon closing, the banks' spot selling prices were: British gold at 士 five one five six 二五 at 四辦, and US dollars at seven yuan five six 二五. British gold for this month was 士 half at 四辦, and US dollars at seven yuan five three 一二五. British gold for November was 士 four three seven five at 四辦, and US dollars at seven yuan four 〇六 二五. As a result, compared to the previous day, spot British currency loosened by 〇四六 八七五, and US currency hardened by 〇六 二五. British currency for this month loosened by 〇六 二五, and US currency gained 錢〇九 三七五. Both British and US currencies for November gained 〇三 一二五. In the afternoon, there was no market due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Dollar Continues to Tighten</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 7th: The exchange market opened steadily this morning. Exchange rates for British currency, Japanese Yen, and Shanghai currency were unchanged. US dollar spot rate tightened by 〇六二五, to thirty-five yuan 一八七五. At 11:30 AM, it was stable with no changes. At 11:50 AM, the US dollar spot rate continued to tighten by 〇六二五, to twenty-five yuan 一二五. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Market Extends Gains</p>
<p>Tianjin, 7th: The exchange market opened firm this morning. British currency spot rate loosened by 〇六二五, to three pence 六八七五. US currency spot rate extended gains by 〇六二五, to six yuan 二五. Shanghai currency rose by half a yuan, to one hundred and nineteen yuan and a half. The unofficial rate for "Joint Notes" depreciated by one yuan, to eighty-six yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Market: Hong Kong Gang Still Absorbing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash gold market initially showed signs of weakness in the unofficial market. Although the foreign exchange trend slightly loosened in the morning, and news of victories near Nanchang spread throughout the market, the gold price remained unmoved and even rose. However, there were major underlying reasons for this. The Hong Kong gang relentlessly purchased from morning to noon, indicating strong supporting power. Throughout the day, the market opened slightly weak at four thousand and fifty-five yuan due to the firm foreign exchange rate. Although the foreign exchange rate loosened later, a certain bullion shop and a money exchange business, acting on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, aggressively purchased, pushing the price up to a peak of four thousand and sixty-seven yuan at one point. The market closed at four thousand and sixty-six yuan, a gain of six yuan compared to the previous day. However, a certain gold firm took the opportunity to sell on behalf of multiple parties, causing a temporary pullback. Ultimately, demand exceeded supply, so it was difficult to maintain. The market was closed in the afternoon due to Saturday. It was reported that unofficial trading was still taking place. The market sentiment suddenly shifted due to the rumor that Mr. Soong was appointed as the ambassador to the United States, which was widely believed to greatly support China's finances. This caused the Hong Kong gang's appetite to turn sluggish, and the situation became unsustainable. It was reported that the price had fallen back to within the four thousand and fifty yuan range. Trading was still active for half the day, with approximately eight or nine hundred taels traded. The price of gold ornaments in bullion shops remained unchanged throughout the day. The prices of customs gold and other gold remained stable.</p>
<p>The Fluctuations of Refined Gold Were Only Twelve Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, for each bar (ten taels), the market initially showed slight weakness due to the firm foreign exchange rate, opening down by five yuan. Securities firms sold twenty taels to gold firms for four thousand and fifty-five yuan. After the opening, the market became stable as the Hong Kong gang became active. Bullion shops took in thirty taels from money exchange businesses and securities firms took in ten taels from gold firms, all at four thousand and fifty-eight yuan. Soon after, securities firms sold back twenty taels to a certain bullion shop for four thousand and fifty-seven yuan. At the time, a certain money exchange business took in over two hundred taels from fellow businesses and bullion shops for four thousand and fifty-eight yuan and sixty yuan. Simultaneously, a certain bullion shop also took in thirty taels from fellow businesses for four thousand and sixty yuan. Although the Hong Kong gang's buying remained strong, the market price slightly declined as a certain gold firm tended to sell on behalf of clients, and the foreign exchange rate continued to loosen. Bullion shops sold twenty taels to securities firms for a price of four thousand and fifty-nine yuan. A certain gold firm forcefully sold over a hundred taels to a certain bullion shop, with the price falling from four thousand and fifty-eight yuan to fifty-six yuan. Subsequently, the willingness of sellers gradually waned, and a certain money exchange business resumed buying on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, so the situation turned upward again, rebounding by four yuan. A certain bullion shop took in ten taels from gold firms, with the price being four thousand and sixty yuan. Immediately following this, the price rose by another three yuan, and a certain money exchange business took in twenty taels from bullion shops for a price of four thousand and sixty-three yuan. Later, bullion shops and money exchange businesses frequently offered to sell, temporarily pushing the price down to four thousand and fifty-nine yuan. However, a certain bullion shop soon began buying again, and gold firms slightly followed suit, immediately raising the price by seven yuan. A certain bullion shop took in ten taels from money exchange businesses, with the price being four thousand and sixty-six yuan. As cash gold firms sold actively, the price fell back by four yuan. Money exchange businesses traded ten taels amongst themselves for four thousand and sixty-two yuan. At noon, as a certain bullion shop began buying again, the market sentiment turned firm again, raising the price by five yuan. A certain bullion shop took in twenty taels from cash gold firms, with the price being four thousand and sixty-seven yuan. Following this, money exchange businesses took in ten taels from securities firms, with the closing price being four thousand and sixty-six yuan. As a result, the price gained six yuan compared to the previous day. The fluctuations were only twelve yuan for half the day. The selling price of the cash gold firms' branded gold was ten yuan higher than the price of refined gold, and the buying price was approximately thirty yuan lower. The cash price was over fifty yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments in Bullion Shops Remained Unchanged</p>
<p>The exchange rate for gold ornaments in bullion shops, per tael, rarely fluctuated with refined gold, so it remained unchanged. Da Tong Hang listed at four hundred and ten yuan, the same price as Xin Tong Hang. The buying price was approximately twenty yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Main Market Soared— 一便士 Two Five—</h3>
<p>London, 6th: The main market silver market saw Indian and speculative buyers, with limited supply, leading to a sharp increase of 一辦士 two five in both near and far-term rates. The market situation was flat. There were no major transactions after closing. Also, according to a New York telegram, the price of American silver rose 一二五, with the spot price at three 角 five 分 一二五. Also, according to a Bombay telegram, both current and future Indian silver prices rose sharply by 一羅比 〇五安那. The market situation was flat, with a total of fifty contracts traded.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for accepted drafts suddenly declined. In the morning, it was still around seventy yuan per thousand, but it suddenly fell to sixty-seven yuan and fifty cents in the afternoon, two yuan and a half lower than the previous day. The interbank lending rate quoted by the Money Industry Association was 一角 nine 分 for both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Fall One After Another</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies, after repeated selling by exporters in the exchange market, found it increasingly difficult to rebound. The sentiment among fellow businesses was also pessimistic, leading to active selling with a sense of oversupply. As a result, the British gold pound fell by 五角, the British gold note decreased by 三角, and US notes decreased slightly by 一角 half. Hong Kong notes fell by 二分, the French franc note decreased by 二厘, and the Canadian note decreased by 一角. The Japanese gold note and the Korean note saw a severe decline, with the former decreasing by slightly 二分 and the latter also decreasing by 一分 five 厘.</p>
<h3>Securities: Northern Hunan Battle Improves, Domestic Bonds Surge, Foreign Stocks Also Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the securities unofficial market continued to show a strong trend, with prices rising steadily in both the morning and afternoon. Since the news of the improved battle situation in Northern Hunan, the sentiment of the bulls has risen, not only unwilling to sell but also adding positions. There were few scattered retail investors taking profits. The trend was stronger in the afternoon. Class A bonds pierced through fifty-five yuan, Class B bonds pierced through forty-eight yuan, Class C and E bonds both broke through the seven-yuan mark, and Class D bonds, due to the upcoming lottery, broke through both the six-yuan and seven-yuan marks. The situation was excellent. All parties believed that Class C, D, and E bonds would soon break through the fifty-yuan mark. Yesterday morning, the prices were firm, rising by 三五角. The news was even better in the afternoon, and all bonds broke through the one-yuan mark. Class C bonds, due to the lottery on the ninth, were priced based on the ex-lottery price starting from the ninth. Yesterday afternoon, there were two markets, with the price difference between the cum-lottery and ex-lottery prices being around half a yuan. The market price resulted in a continued increase of 六角 to 一元二角. The total transaction volume was approximately one million yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: Fifty shares of the Bank of China were traded at a price of fifty-three yuan.</p>
<p>The Industry Association also reported that the activity in the stock market yesterday did not diminish, and new high prices appeared for various well-known stocks. It seems that a considerable amount of capital has flowed into the market recently, likely due to the reduced scope of speculation in other markets, leading people to join the stock market. Taking the exchange market as an example, the difference between near and far-term rates was previously very large, offering arbitrageurs a very high interest rate. However, the exchange rate has gradually converged, and there is no longer much attraction. The large amount of capital used for arbitrage at that time has now been diverted to various industrial stocks, which is to be expected.</p>
<p>London, 6th: Today's listed prices for British merchant Far East company stocks still included several types such as the Shanghai Waterworks, with stable prices and no changes.</p>
<p>London, 6th: Today's foreign prices for Chinese stocks still included four types such as Sino-French and American gold, with stable listed prices and no changes.</p>
<p>Lever Brothers Declares Dividend</p>
<p>Lever Brothers (China) Limited, a British merchant company in this city, decided at yesterday's board meeting to pay an interim dividend for 1939 starting from October 13th, at one yuan in national currency per share.</p>
<h3>Grains: Domestic Rice Rises and Then Returns to Flat, Customer purchases five thousand bags</h3>
<p>The declining trend in the rice market has stabilized. Over four thousand bags of goods arrived from Qingjiao and Sujia via train, and there were reports of shortages along the river. Therefore, after the decline, the local stores took action, leading to a tightening of the early market, with prices rising by more than half a yuan. However, given the sharp fluctuations in the market recently, businesses were inevitably wary, so the market loosened again in the afternoon, resulting in a situation that was initially tight and then soft. The closing prices were: Zhente Changxi broken rice at forty-one yuan to forty yuan, middle grade at thirty-five yuan, and lower grade at thirty-three yuan; Changzhou white broken rice at thirty-eight yuan, middle grade at thirty-four yuan five yuan; new glutinous rice at three yuan thirteen yuan; Su Tong Kun broken glutinous rice at thirty-three yuan four yuan, new glutinous rice at thirty-one yuan two yuan; Qingjiao Lvzhong at thirty-two yuan, Mizhong at thirty-one yuan to thirty yuan, Fengjia Baige at thirty yuan to twenty-eight yuan and a half; Songjiang thin broken rice at thirty-three yuan four yuan, special Yangjian at twenty-five yuan, Jiaowei at twenty-three yuan, special Lujian at twenty-six yuan, lower grade at twenty-four yuan and a half, Jiangbei Jian at twenty yuan, Jiaowei at nineteen yuan and a half, Wuhu white Jian at twenty yuan zero six jiao, middle grade at twenty yuan to nineteen yuan and a half, Jiaowei at eighteen yuan eight jiao to eighteen yuan and a half, 砶jian at eighteen yuan to seventeen yuan and a half, Chen bian yuan at thirty-two yuan three yuan, new yuan at thirty yuan to twenty-nine yuan seven jiao. The total trading volume was over seven thousand bags.</p>
<p>Another report: The customer glutinous rice market has stabilized. After repeated sharp declines in rice prices, vendors found the costs high and transportation unprofitable, so future sources may decrease. There were also reports that the procurement permits in Jiangbei would expire on the 11th of this month and would not be extended, so the market sentiment returned to flat. Since customer glutinous rice prices were low, 砶 rice at eighteen yuan and machine rice at nineteen yuan suited the needs of the countryside, inland, and the city. The trading volume increased to over five thousand bags, and the high prices of various grades immediately increased by 二三角. However, over six thousand bags of Wuhu rice arrived yesterday.</p>
<h3>Flour: Customer Sales Sharply Decrease, Wheat Shows Low Supply and Demand, Inventory Around 400,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's spot flour trading was even more flat. Customer sales have sharply decreased because of the current difficulties in stacking flour in factories and warehouses and the issue of additional loss fees. Customers can only purchase based on shipping availability. Small-scale retail trading in the city has also decreased. However, factories still require the original plate price of seven yuan and are unwilling to loosen it, so the sellers seeking to sell recycled goods are not as eager as in the previous two days. It is reported that the price for old car brands is six yuan seven jiao half to seven yuan, and the prices for Bingshipai and Hong Lan Fuxin are six yuan six jiao seven jiao. The total number of bags traded by local customers was over two thousand bags. The market changes will depend on the beginning of next week.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, both the supply and demand for wheat were low. The sources from various regions totaled five to six thousand bags. Since the Shanghai market price declined, vendors have been decreasing daily. However, the production price is still high, and sellers are unwilling to sell cheaply. Yesterday's factory demand was flat. Outside speculators inquired slightly. The current wheat inventory is approximately four hundred thousand bags. With the voice of foreign wheat sources being unsustainable, the market is unlikely to decline, and will likely remain stable. Fuxin and Fufeng factories jointly handled a total of one thousand two hundred bags of Chang, Xi, Jing, Su, and other wheats, and scattered stockpiles absorbed three to four truckloads, priced at nine yuan eight jiao to nine yuan. The market was.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Reaches New High Price</h3>
<p>Soybean oil has recently seen a lack of sources, stockpilers adding positions, and rumors spreading, leading to opportunists taking advantage of the situation and aggressively raising prices. As the market continues to move forward, it reached a new high price yesterday. Kobe oil opened at seventy-four yuan eight jiao, with eighty barrels traded. Dalian oil closed at seventy-three yuan five jiao, with a total of fifty barrels traded. Jiaozhou oil reached forty-seven yuan, with a total of one hundred and seventy pieces opened. Yantai oil was forty-seven yuan eight jiao for fifty pieces, Qingqi oil was forty-six yuan two jiao, with fifty pieces traded, and canned white oil was three hundred cans, priced at sixty-three yuan. For peanut oil, Hong Kong parties handled one thousand four hundred cans of Qingdao canned oil, priced at seventy-five yuan five jiao. The market is in a stable state, with no special changes.</p>
<h3>Coal: Hongji Coal Arrives Again with Over 2,000 Tons</h3>
<p>Hongji coal has arrived continuously in recent days. Yesterday, another two thousand two hundred and forty tons arrived, transported by the Taikoo Company on the Suzhou ship. It was imported yesterday afternoon and docked at the wharf outside the French Concession.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Actual Sales Too Sluggish, Yarn Market Lacks Momentum</h3>
<p>The yarn market has begun to decline. The trends are disordered and inconsistent. Due to sluggish actual sales, weak market sentiment, and large amounts of unsupported settlements, the market is even more sluggish. However, major players still absorb when prices fall and do not release their holdings. As for customer groups and the Hong Kong group, the desire to buy cheap goods arises again when prices decline, so they are currently hesitant. The fundamental problem is that actual trading is too sluggish, and the ability to rise is weak. As for a large decline, it is also because the factory foundations are not loose, and there is an attitude of hesitation.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the spot yarn market was very weak in the morning, and some were selling at lower prices. The opening price for 20-count Shuangma spot was 720 yuan, a large decrease of 20 yuan from the previous day. The warehouse receipt price was still flat, only slightly lower by 七八 yuan. Soon, buyers rushed in due to the low price, and the Guang group also came to pull in, jumping ten yuan to 735 yuan. The warehouse receipt price was 715 yuan. By the time of closing, there were rumors of improved military situation in Nanchang, and the market sentiment rose, rising another three or four yuan. The spot price for Shuangma was 742 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 720 yuan. The half-day trading statistics showed 945 bags traded. The price of 20-count Shuangma rose by five jiao, Tiannv remained unchanged, Shuangdiqiu fell by one yuan, and Muyang fell by eleven yuan. The Shenxin factory opened with 550 bags of 10-count Tongzijun, priced at 590 yuan, and 200 bags of 32-count Tiannv, priced at 850 yuan. The amounts purchased by each group are listed below.</p>

<h3>Tong Tai Cotton Fell by 3-4 Yuan</h3>
<p>The cotton business's trading volume was still not weak. However, the selling price was affected by the temporary congestion of arrivals and declined. Whether this source can continue to be smooth is still a question. Today, the price of cotton fell by 二三 yuan for Tonghua and 三四 yuan for Taicanghua. Chinese factories have not changed their prices. However, Japanese factories are buying 400 pieces of Indian cotton. 5,698 packages of Tongdan flowers from Subei arrived, and 2,709 packages from Changyinsha arrived. The current situation of spot cotton is listed on the left.</p>
<p>New Tonghua 145.0 over 1,000 packages from fellow businesses</p>
<p>Taicanghua 142.0 and another 300 packages</p>
<p>Hui Sideng 180.0 Dakang 200 pieces</p>
<p>Pengjiapu 182.0 and another 200 pieces</p>
<p>In addition, foreign cotton trading in Shanghai has become very loose recently, and fellow businesses have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The factories are also relaxing their purchasing efforts due to rumors. However, the factory's inventory is not thick. The cost of transporting Indian cotton to China will increase by 20% next month. Currently, there are many Brazilian cotton arrivals in the market, and the price is very cheap, making it a good time to purchase cheap cotton. According to various opinions, exchange rates are unlikely to rise again in the future, so fellow businesses with inventory are unwilling to sell.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market rose in the morning due to purchases by fellow businesses. Liverpool's telegram reported a rise. The spot trading market has been very firm recently due to the increased demand from the Far East, and exporters have been quite active, also rising by over ten pounds. Later, the market suddenly fell back due to the emergence of long positions. As a result, the closing price was still up by 五六 pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market was very quiet. The Egyptian cotton market fell by over ten pounds yesterday. Liverpool rose by five pence.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Zhili Silk Sees Slight Trading, Selling Price Rises by Approximately 30 Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, the domestic silk market has been very quiet for white factory silk. Most silk factories in this city can now continue to operate without being affected by raw materials, accounting for a very small number of factories. Therefore, most of the spot goods are still held by the factories, waiting for a good price. Although Yokohama silk prices have reported a rise of 35 yuan, Shanghai silk trading has not yet started. The Zhili silk market once showed signs of prosperity the week before, but also due to the lack of inventory in the interior, and the even greater shortage of upper-grade silk, the Zhili silk trading for six numbers is also in a stalemate. Yesterday, only Zhili middle-grade and lower-grade silk were sold for 100+ loads, priced at 1,680 yuan, a rise of approximately 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Fluctuate Indefinitely</h3>
<p>There were not many foreign sugar transactions yesterday, and there was another decline. The association's market price was 1.40 for coarse white sugar, with local warehouses at 54.5 yuan and foreign warehouses initially at 55 yuan, then falling to 54.4 yuan. Re-export goods were still at 42.5 yuan. Taikoo's car white was down two jiao, with East Warehouse's B mark at 59 yuan, West Warehouse's C W mark at 58.8 yuan, C X mark at 58.3 yuan, D J mark at 57.8 yuan, H X mark at 57.3 yuan, and H mark's car red was down five jiao, at 42.7 yuan, He Red at 44 yuan, down two jiao. Local cotton white was down half a yuan, with Zhenji No. 1 at 55.5 yuan, No. 2 at 55 yuan, No. 3 at 54.5 yuan, and No. 4 at 54 yuan. Local ice was down one yuan, with No. 1 at 66.5 yuan and Jing Ming brand at 68 yuan. National Sugar Xinghua Red and White has not yet been reported, and there is still a lack of formal market, and it is bound to be difficult to be too high.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: New Xingyuan Osmanthus Fruit Agreed Prices High</h3>
<p>The new Xinghua goods of dried osmanthus fruit have been high in cost since their arrival, and have not loosened. Agreed prices have already been opened. The full price for the authentic brand is 168 yuan, the barrel is 167 yuan, the authentic second is 163 yuan, the third is 125 yuan, Xingji is 105 yuan, and the fourth round is 135 yuan. Cold-stored old goods differ by more than 10 yuan to 10 yuan. Old goods that have been baked again are reduced by another 11 to 12 yuan to 5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Velvet Is the Only Strong Performer, Many Others Are Falling</h3>
<p>National Cloth: Yesterday's market continued to fall. As the Hong Kong authorities added controls on foreign exchange, and exchange rates soared, Singapore and other places adopted the same measures, so the purchasing situation for the Hong Kong group and the Southeast Asian group was sluggish. The remaining locations reduced their purchases due to the falling market price, so trading was very quiet. The local street and the Jiangsu and Zhejiang inland groups had extremely prosperous trading due to the development of autumn sales, so velvet was the strongest among the current sales goods, and the market price rose by two jiao and a half to five jiao per piece. There is a shortage of spot goods, and the brushed factories are rushing to deliver goods day and night. Fine cloth and fine twill had little trading, and the price per piece fell by 二三角. Rough cloth and rough twill had over 200 packages purchased in this street, and the price fell by 五分 to 一角. There was extremely little trading in colored cloth and colored twill, and the wholesale shops were doing their best to sell off inventory, with no buying. Spring light-colored goods such as satin, plain crepe, and bleached twill were hoarded by customers from the Sichuan-Tianjin and Yangtze River groups, and the spot inventory was low, creating a great rarity.</p>
<p>Dongbu: The declining trend of white goods and fine twill has not ended. Yesterday, the price continued to fall by 二角半 to 五角 per piece. The spot price for 12-pound Longpiao fine cloth fell to 21.5 yuan per piece, Yanghe fine cloth was 21 yuan, and Longtou fine twill was 20.075 yuan. The market price is getting softer and the trend is becoming more stagnant. Customers rarely purchase, but fellow traders on this street are calm and still hoard when prices are low, so the total number of pieces traded throughout the day was approximately 六七 hundred pieces.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Feels Uneasy; A Shanghai-Hangzhou Train Derailed Again Yesterday; A Landmine Exploded in Chang'an, Xiashi; Dozens of Passengers Killed and Injured; Chinese Troops Reportedly Captured Zhapu</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway lines have always been strongholds relied upon by the Japanese army as the lifeline of transportation. Recently, Chinese guerrillas have been active everywhere. Last month, the railway tracks at Zhaze and Henglin on the Shanghai-Nanjing line were destroyed. Earlier this month, another train derailed at Longtan. Along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, there have been frequent encounters everywhere, making it impossible for the Japanese army to cope. Yesterday, a passenger train derailed again between Chang'an and Xiashi stations in Haiyan County. More than a dozen Japanese were killed or injured, and twenty to thirty Chinese passengers were killed or injured. In addition, Chinese troops attacked near Xin Feng and Changzhou stations on the Shanghai-Nanjing line. There are reports that Zhapu in Zhejiang Province has been captured by Chinese troops. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Landmine Explosion</p>
<p>At about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, a regular passenger train heading from Hangzhou to Shanghai encountered a landmine planted by Chinese troops as it approached Chang'an Station and continued east towards Xiashi. With a loud bang, the locomotive and first- and second-class carriages at the front of the train immediately derailed. At that time, four vehicles were damaged. After most of the passengers were excessively shaken, clear sounds of rifles and machine guns were heard from near the railway tracks, continuing incessantly. A small number of Japanese troops stationed there rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm and engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese guerrillas. The gunfire gradually subsided after more than half an hour. The Chinese troops, having accomplished their mission, also withdrew.</p>
<p>Many Killed and Injured</p>
<p>While the two armies were engaged in fierce battle, most of the uninjured passengers on the train crawled into the dense woods to avoid stray bullets. When the Chinese troops withdrew, they saw five or six Japanese dead and more than a dozen injured. Several Chinese passengers were killed and more than twenty injured. Scattered items from the luggage car attached to the train were also scattered all over the ground. The injured passengers groaned and cried in pain. The Chinese troops also fought bravely, with one person sacrificing on the spot. Later, Hangzhou Railway Station heard the news and urgently sent mechanics and another passenger train to the scene of the accident to move the derailed vehicles to the side of the road and repair the tracks. The passengers changed trains one after another and continued east. They arrived in Shanghai from Chang'an with passengers at about 3:00 PM. The injured Chinese passengers have been sent to Japanese hospitals for treatment.</p>
<p>Frequent Good News</p>
<p>The guerrillas in the Jiangnan area are now launching a general offensive in October. There are more than 100,000 regular guerrilla troops fighting on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. Those on the Shanghai-Nanjing line have launched fierce attacks in Yixing, Wujin, Wuxi, and the four suburbs of Nanjing, the provincial capital of Zhenjiang. There are reports of the recapture of Yixing. Xin Fengzhen, the Shanghai-Nanjing station in Zhenjiang, has been occupied by the New Fourth Army. The guerrillas of Zhu Songshou in Wuxi and Jiangyin once attacked the Japanese army in Changzhou, killing hundreds of enemies. Two trucks of the puppet pacification army on the Fenghuangjing highway bridge on the Wuxi-Shanghai highway in Suzhou were also destroyed. Those on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, Xiashi, Jiaxing, and Pinghu, are all surrounded. The port of Zhapu has been recaptured, and all Japanese troops have withdrawn. Jiashan has been destroyed. Although it has been repaired, the entire area is controlled by guerrillas. There are daily reports of puppet troops in various places turning against the Japanese.</p>
<h3>A Charity Bazaar at an English Girls' School; More Than a Thousand People Attended; The Results Were Extremely Satisfactory</h3>
<p>The charity bazaar to help the poor and sick at Renji Hospital was held at the English Girls' School on Haig Road yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM. More than a thousand Chinese and foreign guests attended, an unprecedented event. Mrs. Liu Wu Zhuosheng, the president of the Women's Auxiliary Association of Renji Hospital, and Mrs. Mossa伯, the British Judge, gave speeches. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Unprecedented Grand Occasion</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, the English Girls' School was crowded with people. More than 900 Westerners and more than 100 Chinese attended, an unprecedented event after the war. The bazaar was set up in the school's classrooms. The items for sale included Chinese antiques, children's toys, women's supplies, food, candy, children's clothing, handicrafts, etc. Most of them were donated by Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, The Sun, Wing On Textile Company, Sullivan, 大來, and 凱士令 and other companies, as well as the products of patients from Renji Hospital, colorful and dazzling. The guests were all charitable, buying very enthusiastically regardless of the price of the items.</p>
<p>A Variety of Performances</p>
<p>In addition to selling donated items, the association also had various entertainments to broaden the effect of fundraising. The entertainments included Chinese string puppet shows, Peking Opera gongs and drums, which were very popular with Westerners, one-yuan lotteries, one-yuan raffles, and various children's games, which were participated in by purchasing tickets, such as ball throwing, toy digging in sand-filled wooden boxes, shadow puppetry, Beijing dough figurines, and sliding competitions. The school's playground was filled with chairs and tables for guests to use for refreshments. British women dressed as Scottish country girls, holding food to sell, wearing tall hats and long clothes, which added to the fun. A Western orchestra of more than thirty people played from time to time. The music was melodious. The guests dispersed happily at about 6:00 PM, and all returned fully loaded, with no one returning empty-handed.</p>
<p>Relief for the Poor and Sick</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, Mrs. Mossa伯, the British Judge, and Mrs. Liu Wu Zhuosheng, the president of the Women's Auxiliary Association, gave speeches successively, explaining that the proceeds from this charity sale would be donated to the Women's Auxiliary Association to help the poor and needy Chinese who visit and are hospitalized at Renji Hospital. They hoped that the guests would be charitable and purchase enthusiastically. The Women's Auxiliary Association is organized by Chinese and Western women and has five committees: childcare, clothing, occupational therapy, toys, and books, with the aim of helping the poor and sick. A charity sale must be held every year. This year is the second time. Last year's charity sale raised more than 3,000 yuan. This time, because there were so many guests, the income is expected to be huge.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Actually Invaded AoJiang; Chinese Troops Fought Back and Repelled Them; Attempt to Block the Navigation Route of Pipa Mountain; The Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Forces Have Deployed Heavy Troops</h3>
<p>According to reliable information from the shipping industry, after the Japanese side declared that military operations would be carried out in AoJiang, 30 miles south of Wenzhou, from the morning of the 6th, two Japanese warships sailed into the sea area of AoJiang Pipa Mountain at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday. They put down four motorboats, carrying Japanese soldiers to invade the SanShaBu River bank. The local garrison rose up to fight back and fired with machine guns. After half an hour of fierce fighting, the Japanese boats could not hold on and fled back to the warships. As of last night, they had not invaded again, but the Japanese warships were still returning and staying, not leaving. Observing their purpose, they attempted to block the north-south navigation of AoJiang Pipa Mountain with obstacles. Along the coast of AoJiang, the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander has deployed heavy troops.</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Bomb; Minimal Damage</p>
<p>At 1:40 PM on September 25, Pingyang County in AoJiang was bombed by three Japanese planes. Four bombs were dropped on the banks of AoJiang, one of which was an incendiary bomb, which landed near the Chenfu Temple. Two bombs landed in Zhongbu and Shangbu, and another bomb landed in the Shengpinglou Restaurant. Fortunately, there was no major damage to the local area. The next day, three more Japanese planes circled and scouted the Jiang area. As for the blockade line of AoJiang, it is very solid, so it is by no means easy for the Japanese army to land at Gu'aotou and invade Pingyang. Moreover, the highways connecting Pingyang and Yongjia have long been destroyed.</p>
<p>Blessed to Arrive in Shanghai; Navigation Cut Off</p>
<p>The British Yilong Company's Shenyou Wheel loaded cargo from Gu'aotou on the 3rd and sailed to Shanghai, and it arrived only at 8:00 AM yesterday. The ship was fortunately peaceful along the way. In order to avoid danger, the shipping companies have decided to temporarily suspend navigation on this route.</p>
<h3>National Day Commemoration with Hanging Flags; Temporary Security Measures in the Concessions; Municipal Council and Various Agencies Closed; Police and Detectives in Both Concessions Strengthened Prevention</h3>
<p>All sectors of the city will commemorate National Day the day after tomorrow. During this extraordinary period, in accordance with the Central Government's clear orders, there will be no extravagant celebrations and no ceremonies will be held. However, in order to commemorate the revolutionary martyrs for their great achievements in creating the republic and establishing the Republic of China, flags will be hung for one day in accordance with the arrangements of various groups and both governments. All agencies in the city, such as the Municipal Council, the Postal Bureau, the courts at all levels in the Special Zone, various schools, and various groups, will also close as usual to celebrate. At the same time, the police authorities in the rainy concessions, in order to prevent incidents and maintain law and order within the boundaries, will implement temporary security measures on that day. All police officers in the various police stations have been ordered to cooperate fully and to increase patrols to inspect pedestrians and vehicles on the roads. Prevention will be further strengthened in the areas beyond the boundaries of western Shanghai.</p>
<p>Security Measures Taken as Usual</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that less than three weeks after the anniversary of the September 18th Shenyang Incident, the police and military authorities in both concessions were yesterday (the 6th) drafting plans for the security measures to be taken on Double Ten Day. It is heard that the security measures taken on Double Ten Day will be similar to those taken on July 7th and September 18th, and their scope will not be greater than that taken on August 13th this year.</p>
<p>Obstacles Set Up at Key Road Intersections</p>
<p>Although the complete plan for security measures has not yet been drafted, it is heard that barbed wire obstacles will be erected at the intersections of the roads around the city and connecting Edward Road and Avenue Foch. All personnel of the police departments of both concessions will not be allowed to take leave for 24 hours on that day. Foreign troops will cooperate with the police authorities of both concessions as usual to maintain law and order and to assume defense duties.</p>
<p>Merchant Corps and Garrison Troops Join the Alert</p>
<p>Members of the Russian detachment of the International Merchant Corps will serve in the Central and Old Zha districts and will add truck patrols. The British West Yorkshire Regiment, the East Surrey Regiment, the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment, and the Italian Marine Corps will all participate in the security plan in the Public Concession. In the French Concession, three French battalions will assist the police department in carrying out security.</p>
<h3>The Quick News Agency Chief Talks About the Photography Incident; The Japanese Reporter Was Too Bored; No Protest Planned</h3>
<p>Two Japanese reporters from the Japanese-language Continental News and one Korean reporter suddenly sneaked to the front of the British Quick News Agency the night before yesterday to take pictures. After being discovered, they were arrested by the police and sent to the police station, and then released. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, the reporter went to the Quick News Agency to meet with the president, Mr. 英眾弗利脫. Mr.弗利 said that the reporter from the Continental News was incredibly stupid. Why didn't they notify me in advance about what they wanted to do? If they had asked me to take pictures, I would have agreed. Why did they have to act out this comedy? The reporter asked, "Will you protest against this action by the Japanese?" Mr.弗利 replied, "Why bother? They have already made an excellent free advertisement for our company. I am satisfied." Mr.弗利 also said that people from the Continental News had visited our company three times in the past two days. The first time was the night before last, when the newspaper sent a representative to tell me not to pay the fees for the Continental News to people who were not sent by the newspaper. The second time was two hours before the invasion and photography, when a bill collector from the Continental News came to collect the newspaper fees from our newspaper. I wanted to prove that he was really sent by the newspaper, so I called to inquire, confirmed that it was correct, and paid the money. Then came the third action (photography). The two of them lit magnesium lights and quickly tried to take a picture, then ran away, but were arrested by the Central Police Station. I asked them why they invaded the area. They replied that they came to try to take a picture of an anti-Japanese telegraph machine.</p>
<h3>The Reason Why the Deyao Wheel Stopped Sailing; The Japanese Said There Were Guerrillas on Board; The Shipowner Said It Was a Debt Dispute</h3>
<p>The Portuguese merchant Yihua Company's Deyao Wheel, which runs between Shanghai and Beisha, was detained by the Japanese-commanded puppet police at the Lujiazui River the day before yesterday morning after loading passengers and goods from Qinglonggang to Shanghai. It was taken to the fishing market to dock. It is learned that the Portuguese 利國, the superintendent of Yihua Company, had negotiated with the Japanese side yesterday morning. The reason given by the Japanese side for the detention was that guerrillas were mixed in among the crew, and they would only be released after the investigation was clear. According to the company's news, the passengers and goods on the ship have been unloaded at the fishing market and transferred to Shanghai. According to the shipowner's news, the ship has temporarily stopped sailing for one or two shifts due to a debt dispute. The rumors that it was detained are actually a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>The Golden Gate Exposition Ends Early</h3>
<p>The Universal Golden Gate Exposition, initiated by the mayor of San Francisco, USA, officially opened on Treasure Island on February 18 this year. Countries along the Pacific coast participated in the exhibition. Our government did not officially participate because it was during the war of resistance. Only Chinese merchants and overseas Chinese automatically participated in the name of manufacturers. The conference was originally scheduled for one year. Due to the shadow of the European War, the Universal Golden Gate Exposition was ended early on the 29th of this month.</p>
<h3>Charity Dance Competition</h3>
<p>The Charity Dance Competition, organized by the Dance Hall Group Fundraising Committee of the Refugee Relief Association of this city, has been held successively in Yunshang, Paramount, Metropolitan, and other dance halls. The fourth decision is to hold it at the Lido Garden Dance Hall on Medhurst Road, starting at 4:00 PM today. Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng have been invited to give speeches. All the red stars of the dance industry and the members of the Women's Friendship Association are enthusiastically participating in the dance. There are also six Western famous song and dance performances, which are very grand and colorful. Tickets are two yuan per person, and all proceeds will be donated.</p>
<h3>Unfavorable Exchange Rate; Imports and Exports Are Declining; Opinions of U.S. Department of Commerce Personnel; It Is Also Difficult to Export Domestic Products Overseas</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that the U.S. Commercial Counselor's Office has received dozens of inquiries from Shanghai importers in the past two weeks, inquiring about news about German products. These products were previously shipped from Germany, but now, due to the war, they can no longer be obtained from Germany. In peacetime, this is a sign of the prosperity of U.S. exports. However, according to the opinion of personnel from the U.S. Commercial Counselor's Office yesterday (the 6th), there is little hope for a large increase in trade between the two sides of the Pacific. The reason is that the unfavorable exchange rate makes it very expensive to ship overseas goods here and pay in foreign currencies. Therefore, only a small amount of goods can be shipped at a time, and orders will be placed again after the inventory is sold. The Chinese war has added more unfavorable factors to the import and export trade situation in this city. Although Chinese merchants who had prosperous trade during the last war hope that this trade will prosper again, they cannot now obtain Chinese products from the interior to export overseas. Japanese merchants, who had great success in trade with the United States during the previous war, are now hampered by their country's wartime needs.</p>
<h3>Indica Rice Enters the 20 Yuan Mark; Rice Prices Are Unclear; Purchase of Foreign Rice Suspended; 斛司 Asks to Inspect Rice, 米業 Refuses</h3>
<p>Recently, the amount of rice transported to Shanghai from various places has increased compared to the previous month, and sales have become clearer, with a gradual increase in the bottom line. People's hearts are stable. At the rice shops and tea houses, sellers are suppressing prices to sell. People's hearts are looking small. Indica and japonica rice have all fallen in price. The market opened as usual at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Although there were many people who went to the market's public sample office to take samples, the transactions were quite light. Sales in this street are not good. Representatives of traveling merchants are offering prices to buy and sell. The selling price of 米業 is 17.5 yuan, and the top price of new Pudong rice is 32 yuan. The selling price of Wuhu rice has fallen into the price limit set by the former concession authorities.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Indica and Japonica Rice Are About to Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the news from the rice market yesterday morning, a large quantity of indica rice from Wuhu is about to arrive in Shanghai and will be available for sale within a few days. Regarding the joint purchase of Saigon foreign rice by various groups in this city, the Shanghai Accountants Association had previously notified all rice purchasers to postpone the purchase because the Saigon authorities prohibited the export of rice. According to inquiries, the source of domestic rice has increased, and rice prices are trending downward. The groups will temporarily suspend the purchase of foreign rice.</p>
<p>斛司 Asks to Open Bags and Inspect Rice</p>
<p>The total number of 斛司 in the city is more than 1,000. After the war, rice transported to Shanghai by people was changed from bulk to bagged, resulting in no rice for 斛司 to inspect, and they were unemployed. On December 15 last year, after a meeting of various rice industry groups, it was decided that for those who had passed the 斛司, the rice shops would deduct one cent per stone of 斛力 as relief. Recently, due to the increase in the cost of living, all relief measures are difficult to maintain a livelihood. Therefore, the rice industry travelers are required to deduct one cent of 斛力 from all rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains of foreign machine and Yangtze River origin, and to automatically open bags and inspect rice that is shipped and delivered from October 8. The Bean and Rice Industry Association stated that there was no custom of inspecting and deducting 力斛 from foreign machine goods and Yangtze River goods before the war. This request from 斛司 is difficult to accept, so it was rejected. The attitude of 斛司 is also very firm. Therefore, this matter may cause disputes. In order to prevent accidents, the police authorities of both concessions have decided to increase patrols to protect the shipment of rice from the various foreign docks from today.</p>

<h3>Puppet Police Held Drills in Residential Areas in Western Shanghai Yesterday; Even Trampling on Private Gardens; Philipps Expresses He Will Not Abandon Rights</h3>
<p>Since the intrusion of puppet police into the area of roads built beyond the boundary, the situation has deteriorated. However, because the Municipal Council has always dealt with the various acts of overreach of the puppet police with perseverance, no major accidents have occurred. Recently, the Japanese and puppet police, in addition to actively organizing "special task forces" and "self-defense corps," have not been seen to continue to expand, and the mood of residents has been slightly stabilized, and the trend of migration has been slightly reduced. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter went to the area for a week-long inspection. It was learned that at about 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a team of puppet police, 75 people, conducted drills near the residence of Baron Peck弗理司, the Swedish ambassador to Columbia Road in western Shanghai, and even invaded people's gardens, causing nearby residents to be frightened. In addition, the deployment of Japanese and puppet forces remains the same as before. As for the police, they are still in the border area, allowing strict inspection of pedestrians and vehicles at various key locations. After being briefly occupied by the Japanese and puppets at 99 Jessfield Road, they only stayed for a few days before withdrawing. The residents of the house have all moved back. At present, the puppet police in western Shanghai are starting to investigate household registrations, and at the same time, the puppet "Finance Bureau" has also started to handle property registration to achieve its attempt to gradually collect taxes and donations.</p>
<p>Blocking Traffic for Study</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a large team of puppet police held a military exercise in the area of roads built beyond the boundary in western Shanghai. The reporter from 大中社 learned the details as follows: At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, more than 70 puppet police and Japanese military police, carrying rifles and machine guns, drove to the area between Columbia Road and Anhua Temple Road, blocking all traffic. Under the command of the Japanese military police, the puppet police began blank-firing exercises, firing hundreds of shots and charging back and forth. The vegetable gardens in the area were arbitrarily trampled on, and the area was a mess. The puppet police even crossed walls and fences and invaded people's gardens. At that time, the residents within a mile around were greatly frightened. The puppet police's study lasted for 30 minutes before they announced the lifting of the ban. However, after 3:00 PM, the puppet police were still stationed on the roads in the area.</p>
<p>Western Homeowners Are Very Angry</p>
<p>The English 大美 Evening News reported that 75 police officers opened machine guns and rifles near the residence of Swedish Ambassador柏克弗烈斯 and next to the Columbia Association this afternoon (the 7th), seemingly practicing combat. They also trampled through gardens in several private residences, causing neighbors to be in a state of anxiety. According to a phone call to "Mayor" 傳筱庵 to inquire, he claimed to know nothing about it. The reporter then obtained confirmation from homeowners in the area. According to these angry homeowners, there is plenty of space for exercises on the other side of Hongqiao Road.</p>
<p>The Rights and Interests of Western Shanghai Cannot Be Abandoned</p>
<p>The Chinese-language Linbao reported that Municipal Council President Philipps told reporters yesterday afternoon (the 6th) that the Municipal Council is not prepared to abandon any of its rights in the area outside the boundary of western Shanghai. The situation regarding police and other municipal matters in the area has been in a stalemate for a month. An impression has arisen in some quarters that the Municipal Council is gradually yielding to the pressure from the "Special Municipal Government," while 傳筱庵's large number of armed police and tax collectors are appearing in the area. In fact, the Municipal Council has spent huge sums in the area to build houses, repair roads, and engage in general municipal improvements. Therefore, it feels that since the Western District has already created all the necessary residential areas, the taxpayers who contributed to this improvement will be fully protected against encroachment, and the rights and interests of the Municipal Council in the area will also be carefully defended.</p>
<p>Police Force Has Indeed Increased</p>
<p>According to reporters, since the current state of emergency occurred, the Public Concession police force operating in the area of roads outside the boundary has almost tripled. Police officers who could be drawn from other districts have been transferred to protect residents west of Haig Road. Assistant Chief Inspector克 has taken all possible police precautions. As a result of these arrangements, before 4:00 PM this afternoon, there were three concession patrols at each intersection in the area, which increased to five from 4:00 PM to midnight. Police patrols have been increased to six people per team under the command of foreigners.</p>
<p>International Merchant Corps Continues to Patrol</p>
<p>In addition, armored vehicles of the International Merchant Corps are often seen patrolling together in pairs on roads outside the boundary. Roads outside the boundary are located within the defense area of the British and Italian armies. There is currently full cooperation between the Public Concession Police Department and the British and Italian garrisons. It is heard that Philipps and 傳筱庵 only held one meeting at Jiangwan nearly three weeks ago, and have not continued to meet. However, it is heard that the Public Concession authorities are quite willing to consider any suggestions put forward by the "Special Municipal Government" to resolve the current difficult situation.</p>
<p>The Puppet Government's Attitude Remains Strong and Stubborn</p>
<p>The English 大美 Evening News reported that Shanghai "Mayor"傅筱庵 told reporters yesterday afternoon (the 6th) that unless it is fully acknowledged that the roads outside the boundary in the Western District are located in the Chinese territory and should be governed by the Shanghai "Special Municipal Government," this problem cannot be compromised. The "Special Municipal Government" police force on the roads outside the boundary will gradually increase. The police problem cannot be delayed too long without being resolved. However, 傳氏 refused to respond to Municipal Council President Philipps' statement that "the Municipal Council's rights on the roads outside the boundary will not be abandoned automatically." 傳氏 also said that since he took office, gambling dens and other criminal places have been greatly reduced, most of which have closed down automatically due to "poor business," but he will do his best to curb them all. As far as gambling dens are concerned, the municipal government has never accepted money from gambling dens and other criminal places as "compensation."</p>
<h3>New Cotton from Beisha Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>This year's new cotton has already entered the market, and it is heard that the harvest is still abundant. Recently, it has been continuously shipped to Shanghai from Beisha in large quantities. Yesterday, the Taikoo Wulin Wheel and the Jardine Matheson Tonghe Wheel shipped 5,072 bales. There are also 400 to 500 bales on the Luan and Lisha wheels. Most of this cotton is sold to Japanese yarn mills.</p>
<h3>Export Settlement of Local Products: Aimed at Centralizing Foreign Exchange; Shanghai and Ningbo Chambers of Commerce Have Telegraphed to Request Remedies; Customs Prevents Private Export Through Misuse of Postal Parcels</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Measures for the Settlement of Exported Goods and Receipt of Foreign Exchange Rate Differences," it stipulated that, except for tung oil, tea leaves, bristles, and minerals – the four categories related to barter trade, debt repayment, and raw material reserves – all other exported goods must be sold to the government for foreign exchange at the legal rate. At the same time, the government would provide the difference between the legal rate and the bank's listed price. Customs offices across the country have now been ordered to implement this. Therefore, local products transported to Shanghai from provinces such as Zhejiang and Fujian must be settled at the legal rate. Goods for domestic sale, regardless of type, must also be settled. Various industries have repeatedly requested the chambers of commerce to forward their requests to the government for remedies.</p>
<p>Two Chambers of Commerce Telegraph, Requesting Remedies</p>
<p>Now, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, recognizing that these measures hinder commercial sales and increase hardship for the people, have telegraphed both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, explaining the reasons for this settlement and requesting remedies to alleviate the difficulties faced by merchants in Jiangsu. A reporter from the "New Sound Society" learned yesterday from relevant sources that the government's current regulation on the settlement of local products aims to centralize foreign exchange, maintain the legal currency, stabilize finance, promote exports, and increase domestic production.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Difference Settlement Methods</p>
<p>As for the central bank's legal price, the British pound is set at one shilling and two and a half pence. The listed price of the British pound at the Bank of Communications is seven pence. The so-called "receiving the foreign exchange difference" is the difference between seven pence and one shilling and two and a half pence. The settling bank may charge the settling party the usual handling fee, but it is stipulated that it must not exceed three percent.</p>
<p>Preventing Export Through Misuse of Postal Parcels</p>
<p>The National Government's Ministry of Finance issued a circular to customs offices across the country stating that, in order to prevent export by falsely using postal parcels and evading foreign exchange, the fifth article of the "Implementation Measures for the Sale and Settlement of Foreign Exchange for Postal Parcels" previously drafted by this port was followed as directed by telegram Yu Zi No. 5989. However, upon investigation, the original fourth article stipulates that goods subject to foreign exchange settlement mailed abroad weighing less than three kilograms are treated as samples and are exempt from applying for foreign exchange settlement documents. Currently, because the scope of settlement has expanded, many lightweight but valuable items among foreign exchange goods may inevitably use this to evade foreign exchange. The original text of this article should be supplemented and explained to eliminate abuses.</p>
<p>Supplementary Explanation to Eliminate Abuses</p>
<p>That is, "Goods subject to foreign exchange settlement mailed abroad weighing less than three kilograms are treated as samples and are exempt from applying for foreign exchange settlement documents, but they must be forwarded through Hong Kong's Fuhua Company. The forwarding costs will be borne by the Trade Commission. Parcels weighing less than three kilograms but valued at more than fifty yuan must still be settled according to the regulations." In addition to ordering the Trade Commission to be informed and consulting the Ministry of Communications for reference and to instruct post offices across the country to strictly comply, and instructing all customs offices to comply, a joint telegram is sent for information.</p>
<h3>Japan Obstructs American Broadcasting; Japan Expresses Its Attitude; Details of Japan-US Radio Wave Regulations Unknown; If Joining an Agreement, Should Abide by Regulations</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that when Japanese representatives received journalists yesterday (the 6th), some inquired about the matter of a Japanese radio station with the call sign KZI allegedly interfering with shortwave broadcasts from the RCA radio station on the US West Coast. A spokesperson for the Japanese embassy responded that if Japan is a signatory to the 1932 Madrid International Telecommunications Convention which assigns radio wavelengths, it would naturally abide by the regulations of that convention. One journalist stated that the RCA radio station was assigned a frequency of 9530 kHz in 1928. The spokesperson stated that he was unaware that the KZI radio station had been granted permission to use the 9535 kHz frequency for broadcasting prior to 1928 and that the matter would need to be investigated. One journalist pointed out that the 1932 convention stipulates that the frequency assigned to a radio station should not be interfered with by other radio stations, and the broadcasting frequency of each radio station should not be within 10 kHz of another radio station's frequency. The embassy spokesperson replied that he knew nothing about the radio waves assigned to Japan and the US and therefore could not discuss the matter. However, if Japan is a signatory to the agreement, it would naturally abide by its regulations. An Associated Press dispatch from this port on the 7th stated that broadcasts from the American radio station on the West Coast to this city, which had previously been impossible to receive due to interference from Japan's KZI, showed significant improvement last night. Listeners in this city were able to receive the radio station's rebroadcast of Hitler's speech to the German Reichstag last night. The interference from the Japanese radio station began on October 1st when Japan established a radio station with a frequency five degrees different from that of the American radio station to broadcast to the Dutch East Indies. International radio regulations stipulate that the choice of radio station frequencies must not interfere with other radio stations, and should generally differ by ten degrees. Radio experts in this city believe that the West Coast radio station likely increased its power last night.</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief Donations to Continue for Another Year; Chamber of Commerce Has Been Ordered to Notify All Industries</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to various trade associations and major companies regarding the continuation of disaster relief donations from the business community for another year, stating: "Over the past year, the business community has enthusiastically contributed to disaster relief, exhausting their efforts and resources, which is evident to all, both Chinese and foreign. However, due to the unsettled situation, refugees displaced in Shanghai and sheltered in various reception centers are still difficult to return to their hometowns. It is absolutely unacceptable to stop aid halfway. In addition, rising prices have increased the cost of supplies by more than half compared to before. The relief responsibilities borne by various organizations have not only not lessened at this time but have actually increased. In these times of widespread hardship and distress, appealing to the fundamental principle of human mutual assistance, we must persevere through hardship and strive to fulfill our responsibilities, aiming to thoroughly save people and complete the work. All methods of donating one percent of industry salaries and a percentage of business profits for disaster relief will follow the original plan from last year, with a term of one year. From the date of expiration, the extension of one year should be implemented, so that relief funds can continue to be maintained without interruption. If there is hope for an early end to the refugee relief effort at that time, this donation can also be terminated early. We certainly do not want to burden the business community for a long time, which would violate our original intention. This is declared in advance."</p>
<h3>Citizens Should Use New Fractional Currency Notes Immediately; Do Not Collect Them Out of Curiosity and Hinder Circulation; Rumors of Tobacco Exchange Industry's Monopoly; Industry Denies</h3>
<p>Since the Central Bank issued fractional currency notes, it was originally expected that the rampant situation of substitute vouchers on the market and the difficulties of merchants giving change would be resolved. However, it has been ten days since the Central Bank issued them, and substitute vouchers are still prevalent, while the newly issued fractional currency notes are rarely used. The reason for this is that some shops, not understanding the situation, are hoarding them, and citizens, finding them novel, are competing to collect them, which is causing this situation. The First Special District Citizens' Federation believes that although citizens are collecting these fractional notes out of curiosity, the result is hindering the circulation of the fractional notes, making it possible for various miscellaneous vouchers to continue to circulate. Therefore, they issued a notice yesterday to the branch federations urging citizens not to collect the fractional notes, to use them immediately upon receipt, and to circulate them in the market, so that the problem of the lack of small change in Shanghai can be resolved as soon as possible. The Federation also strictly ordered the member businesses of each branch federation that had previously issued substitute vouchers as a temporary measure to immediately recall them within a limited time, and to invalidate them after the deadline. All sectors of the city are paying close attention to the fact that streetcar substitute vouchers have not yet been fully recovered, fearing that if they circulate for too long, they will become tattered and blurred, causing considerable losses to the people, which will be a major obstacle to the widespread use of fractional currency notes. It is hoped that the authorities of the two concessions and the Central Bank will pay attention to this. As for the rumor that the Central Bank has severely criticized the tobacco exchange industry for monopolizing the fractional notes, the association has denied this, saying that the association distributes the notes to its members and there is no monopoly to speak of.</p>
<h3>Debts and Obligations Involving Counterfeit Money Deemed Invalid; Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industries to Maintain Disaster Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance telegraphed all provincial and municipal governments and chambers of commerce stating that the puppet "Joint Reserve Bank" and "Huaxing Bank" established by the Japanese puppets in Tianjin and Shanghai are issuing counterfeit money. All our citizens, as well as the financial industry and other industries, should refuse to use it. This Ministry has repeatedly telegraphed instructions to comply, and has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to consult the Judicial Yuan to instruct all levels of courts that any debts or obligations based on counterfeit money should be legally invalid. This is on record. Now, we have received Executive Yuan Directive Lü Zi No. 9534 of August 22, 1939, which states, "Noted. The case has been consulted with the Judicial Yuan, which responded with Zi Zi No. 16 of August 5, 1939, and has instructed the Ministry of Justice to comply and instructed the Supreme Court to take note." We are issuing this order to comply, and to forward it to all sectors, and to pay serious attention to it.</p>

<h3>Workers Refuse Gatekeeper's Inspection Upon Leaving Work and Assault Two Police Officers; Assaulting Workers Sentenced to Detention</h3>
<p>The printing department of the German company Ru Lin Foreign Firm at No. 531 Pei Kai Er Road in Pudong has a customary practice of having gatekeepers and Indian police officers inspect workers upon leaving work to prevent theft of items. However, at 4:30 PM the day before yesterday, during dismissal, gatekeeper and Indian police officer Lai La Xing and Chinese police officer Xiao Qunlong were performing their routine duties when suddenly one hundred and several dozen workers in the department resisted.</p>
<p>Refusing Inspection</p>
<p>They claimed that if inspection was required, then senior staff such as managers and executives should also be searched to ensure equality. At the same time, they used violence to assault the two police officers, causing significant injuries to the Indian police officer and tearing the Chinese police officer's uniform. After the Yulin Road Police Station received a report, they immediately ordered Chinese detective Liu Chushun and detective Wang Dongchen to</p>
<p>Rush to Arrest</p>
<p>Wang Shenggen, Wu Caigen, Zhao Guifu, Wang Songhe, Ding Yongzhang, Hang Baidi, Liu Xiaoyang, Hu Akang, Zhang Shunde, Wu Longgen, Pan Yongan, He Zhidao, and Li Zhengming – thirteen people – were arrested. Yesterday, they were brought to the First Special Court. Police station lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that, upon investigation, all the defendants in this case were members of the "Alliance" of the Pudong Dongchang Road, under the direction of a certain party. The "president" is Kong Qingxiang, and the "vice president" is the defendant Wang Shenggen in this case.</p>
<p>This Action</p>
<p>Was a clearly organized action and an intentional act of striking. The police station has already taken measures to stop it. Therefore, he requested that all defendants in this case be punished for assault. Under questioning by Judge Dai Rongduo, Wang Shenggen and the other twelve people were sentenced to fifteen days of detention each as a warning.</p>
<h3>Xinhua Printing House Ransacked by Thugs; Result: Two Lead Printing Plates Carried Away</h3>
<p>The China News Agency reports that the Xinhua Printing House at No. 169 Avenue Edward VII, which specializes in printing various small newspapers, a total of six or seven, suddenly had a person resembling a certain type of person and four or five Chinese men and one woman arrive in a private car at the door of the printing house during busy working hours on the evening of the day before yesterday. They rushed in, and one or two of them seemed to be carrying weapons. They were menacing and beat anyone they saw. The workers, seeing the situation was bad, scattered and fled. The people claimed to be looking for a certain editor of a certain small newspaper. After being told that he was not there and repeated explanations, they carried two lead printing plates of a certain small newspaper that had already been typeset and drove away. Afterwards, after someone reported it to the police station, the police arrived at the scene, but they had already disappeared.</p>
<h3>Accomplice in Murder of Father An Arrested; Held for Joint Trial</h3>
<p>The case of Father An being murdered in Xujiahui at the end of last month, in which the perpetrator Ju Bolv fled from Pudong and surrendered to the French Concession police station, was previously reported. The police station had escorted him to the Second Special Court and requested an extension of detention for investigation. It is now known that the French Concession police station arrested another accomplice in the case the day before yesterday, a local named Wang Guirong, who is over thirty years old. Because further investigation is still required, the French police station escorted Wang Guirong to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday morning to request detention. Judge Miao Qingbang sat in court and questioned him, ordering the defendant Wang Guirong to be detained and rescheduling the joint trial with Ju Bolv for October 15.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement of Compensation: Defendant Acquitted</h3>
<p>The case of rice merchant Zhu Qiu Xiong being sued by rice merchant Yuan Zhonghou of Luxu in the First Criminal Court for embezzling military insurance compensation from the Central Trust Bureau was heard again yesterday morning by Judge Xiao Peishen in the First Criminal Court. He first questioned the defendant about the certification documents from the Yizhong Notary Office. He had not yet obtained them because the rice being transported at that time was lost en route. The Central Trust Bureau paid compensation as usual. Because the plaintiff claimed it was cash, while the defendant claimed the payment was made by check transferred through the Yizhong Notary Office, further investigation was required. Subsequently, the defendant's lawyer, Li Wu, presented a reply from the Yizhong Notary Office in court, proving that the payment was indeed made by check. The defendant then stated that the rice sold by the plaintiff was indeed insured by him with the Central Trust Bureau for over 12,000 yuan. After the rice was damaged, he repeatedly negotiated and finally obtained the compensation. Later, the plaintiff's clerk, Ye, inquired with him, and he also said that the money had been compensated, but the plaintiff needed to find a guarantor to receive it. Because the plaintiff did not have a guarantor, it was not delivered. The money is currently stored in the Meixin Card Company. He then presented the passbook to the court to prove that he had not embezzled anything. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant intended to embezzle the compensation, and he repeatedly negotiated but the defendant always denied it. There is a recording of a telephone conversation between the plaintiff and defendant as evidence. After speaking, he played the recording in court. However, because the language was vague and the pronunciation was unclear, Judge Xiao ruled that the case was clear and began the debate. As a result, the defendant Zhu Qiu Xiong was acquitted in court.</p>
<h3>Chinese Medical Community Holds Memorial Service for Xu Banlong</h3>

They took the robber and the wallet to the police station for questioning.</p>
<h3>National Government Issues Order on Thrift; Prevents Interference with Finance; Saving Material Resources and Financial Resources to Contribute to the Country; Striving to Prevent Interference with Financial Policy</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance promulgated the outline of measures to consolidate finance, wartime financial institutions are becoming more sound. The four banks – Central, China, Communications, and Agriculture – have established a joint office to complete the national financial network with all their strength. They are also encouraging savings, urging the opening of national construction savings, absorbing social idle funds, investing in productive industries, improving overseas remittance methods, spreading overseas remittance financial networks, replenishing foreign exchange, and purchasing materials in war zones to prevent them from being used by the Japanese. They are strengthening the collection of gold and silver and striving to develop mining to increase reserves. Internally, they are seeking to enrich and activate, and externally, they are seeking to resist aggression. However, it requires effort from below to support the financial policy, follow government laws and regulations, and then it can achieve results. Therefore, it has issued a circular to all provincial and municipal governments, instructing their subordinates to ensure that the people of the country save material resources and financial resources, and contribute their strength to the country for the sake of resistance and national construction. Anyone who interferes with the implementation of the government's financial policy should be prevented by officials and the public, and efforts should be made to cherish the people's strength, increase production, develop the economy, and develop transportation to achieve the government's goal of benefiting the country and the people. At the same time, they should publicize as much as possible, urge efforts, and the future of resistance and national construction is heavily dependent on it.</p>
<h3>Japanese University Students Rob a Chauffeur; Three University Students Left School Without Permission, Robbed with Guns, and Were Detained and Sent to the Japanese Authorities</h3>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that three second-year university students at the Tong Wen Academy on Haig Road – Yamamoto Jiro, 25; Izumi Tetsutaro, 21; and Hara So-and-so, 23 – left the school dormitory without permission yesterday (the 6th) and went to the door of a brothel near the intersection of Chongqing Road and Foch Road and threatened a</p>
<p>Japanese Military Police</p>
<p>chauffeur. The police department of the Japanese consulate said that the three students and the chauffeur were drunk at the time.

<p>transferred the three people to the Japanese authorities this morning (the 7th) and accused them of armed robbery to the Japanese consulate police department. It is reported that the Western District Japanese military police believe that this case is not important as far as the military police team is concerned, so the authorities of the Tong Wen Academy and the Japanese consulate police department will jointly handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Chinese Medicine Practitioner Qin Bowen Sued for Rent Arrears</h3>
<p>Verdict: Should Repay All Arrears</p>
<p>Qin Bowen, a well-known local Chinese medicine conditioning expert, had his clinic at No. 20 Zhenping Lane, Avenue Cardinal Foch, French Concession. In June of this year, Qin leased a house located at No. 3 An Village, the corner of Avenue Joffre, Rue Pere Huc, and Rue Auguste Boppe from Zhengda Company to establish a Western District branch of his Chinese medical sanatorium. The lease was long-term. In addition to paying a deposit, he still owed 4,000 yuan in national currency. Qin voluntarily used the lease rights to the house as collateral and signed another contract, limiting the payment to be made before August 1. However, after signing the contract, he has only paid 200 yuan in legal currency and a remittance of 300 yuan. After deducting the discount, the creditor actually received 261.5 yuan. He has not paid a penny of the remaining 3,538.5 yuan after the deadline. Therefore, the legal representative of Zhengda Company, Tong Tiyan, commissioned a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against Qin to pay the rent, requesting that the defendant be ordered to pay the arrears in one lump sum and to grant provisional execution. The case has been tried by Judge Yu Changzi, and the verdict was announced yesterday. The main text reads: "The defendant should repay the plaintiff 3,538.5 yuan in national currency, and from August 2 to the end of the execution, should repay late interest at an annual rate of 5%. The plaintiff's other claims are dismissed. The litigation costs, except for the portion of provisional execution, shall be borne by the defendant."</p>

<h3>Gambling Den and Martial Arts Drama</h3>
<p>The Daxing Entertainment Center in West Shanghai is actually a gambling den with a very large scale. It costs several thousand yuan a day to operate. Since its opening, it has been extremely prosperous. Recently, the owner of the gambling den suddenly discovered that the dice shaker, Xu, the supervisor, Chen, and several internal staff members were colluding to cheat. He therefore monitored them, and a rift arose in their relationship. A few days ago, they suddenly quarreled over a trivial matter, and then the two sides used force, staging a full-scale martial arts performance. The Western District "Police Station" learned of this and quickly dispatched a large number of puppet police – more than 100 – to the gambling den to suppress it and arrest the perpetrators. Nearby residents, suspecting that another conflict had occurred, panicked.</p>

<p>Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>On National Day</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>This newspaper resumed publication during the Double Festival last year, but in the blink of an eye, it's another National Day anniversary. Therefore, this year's National Day is the anniversary week of this newspaper's resumption of publication, and also the anniversary week of the Children's Weekly's resumption of publication. We celebrate Double Ten without holding a ceremony, both for this newspaper and for the Children's Weekly.</p>
<p>Every modern country has a National Day. Speaking of the National Day anniversaries of various countries around the world, February 16th is Lithuania's National Day, February 24th is Estonia's National Day, March 25th is Greece's National Day, April 15th is Spain's Republic Independence Day, May 17th is Norway's National Day, May 20th is Cuba's National Day, June 16th is Sweden's current King's birthday, July 1st is Canada's Dominion Day, July 4th is the United States' Independence Day, July 9th is Argentina's National Day, July 14th is France's Republic Day, July 28th is Peru's Independence Day, August 1st is Switzerland's Federal Government Founding Day, August 6th is Bolivia's Independence Day, August 11th is Germany's Constitution Implementation Day, August 20th is Hungary's National Day, August 25th is Uruguay's National Day, August 31st is the Netherlands' current Queen's birthday, September 16th is Mexico's Independence Day, September 18th is Chile's Independence Day, September 26th is Denmark's current King's birthday, October 5th is Portugal's National Day, October 28th is the Czech Republic's National Day, October 29th is Turkey's Republic Day, November 7th is the Soviet Union's Revolution Anniversary, November 9th is Poland's National Day, November 11th is Italy's current King's birthday, November 12th is Austria's National Day, and December 6th is Finland's Independence Day.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, countries around the world usually celebrate the founding of the nation, the establishment of a republic, or the day of independence, as well as the birthday of the monarch, as their National Day. On this day, the whole country celebrates and it is very lively. China's reason for setting Double Ten as National Day is to commemorate the success of the Xinhai Revolution. In the past, we also made grand celebrations on National Day. However, since "September 18th," the country has been in deep trouble, and ever since the outbreak of the war, for six or seven years until now, no ceremony is held on National Day. Having a country but not being able to celebrate makes everyone feel depressed. However, we can look forward to the day of final victory, when we will celebrate the first Double Ten Festival after China's revival with great enthusiasm!</p>
<h3>Double Ten's New Meaning Encourages Children</h3>
<p>— Chi Qiang</p>
<p>This year is the 28th Double Ten Festival. Connecting them together, they look too much like a ladder. This should symbolize a ladder for us to climb onto the road to national construction.</p>
<p>Double Ten! Double Ten! One ten plus another ten.</p>
<p>Children! For the Double Ten National Day, you should use the "Double Ten" around you to create!</p>
<p>Children, think about it! Where exactly is the Double Ten around you? Maybe you're going to reach out to me instead. Don't ask me, use your hands to create, use your ten fingers to grasp firmly; your feet close to the motherland's mountains and rivers, ten toes supporting the foundation of the Chinese territory, this is originally the business of the "Guo Zi"—the little masters.</p>
<p>Let the dregs float up, let the filth flow, you still have to use "Double Ten" to destroy the old and rotten, I heard that clarification is not far away.</p>
<p>This time, I have seriously thought that the celebration of this Double Ten Festival should be entrusted to you to handle.</p>
<p>Your hands are clean enough, your feet are the most stable; celebrate Double Ten, nurture Double Ten celebrations, send the celebrated ones away and welcome them back, "constantly increasing"! "Constantly striving"! Only your "Double Ten" (hands and feet) can seamlessly connect with Double Ten and become one!</p>
<p>Children! Come, come, come, let us celebrate the Double Ten Festival today in advance, starting from the eleventh, you must create next year's Double Ten celebration! I offer this new meaning to encourage you!</p>
<h3>Short Story</h3>
<p>The teacher asked on the platform: "Who can come up and write three new words?" Mingde said: "I can," the teacher said "jump," he wrote the word "jump"; the teacher said "kick," he wrote the word "kick." The teacher shook his head and said: "Wrong"! Mingde thought he heard wrong, so he didn't write. The teacher called other students to write, but they all wrote incorrectly. At this time, Yimin said: "I can write", the teacher said "jump" he wrote "jump"; the teacher said "follow" he wrote "kick"; the teacher shook his head and said: "Wrong"! So he wrote the word "wrong," and the teacher said: "You are right" (Ci Kai)</p>
<h3>The Great Hunt</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>—Ming Er's Refugee Diary - Thirty-Seven—</p>
<p>November passed quickly again. Counting from the end of October when Ming Er arrived at that village, he had already spent a month living in a foreign land. The thin clothes Ming Er wore had also changed into thick padded clothes, which clearly indicated that it was late autumn and early winter.</p>
<p>Hunting was prevalent throughout the village at that time of year. Several older children in Ming Er's neighborhood went hunting in the mountains and fields almost every day, always bringing back some harvest. This aroused Ming Er's deep admiration—how interesting it is to shoot a gun; how happy it is to hit a wild rabbit with a "ping" sound; how glorious it is to bring back a large string of harvest, which can also show that my eyesight is not bad; and wild rabbit can also serve as a delicious dish for us. This series of fantasies surged in his heart, and finally he told his mother this idea, but was met with a rebuff, because hunting was a dangerous thing in her eyes, and it was not very suitable for Ming Er's health. The old woman cherished her son too much. One day, he asked his mother to agree to let him follow them to gain experience, and somehow he got her consent.</p>
<p>They shouldered earthen guns—very similar to the guns of the patrolmen Ming Er had seen, but smaller. The gun could only fire once each time. After firing a shot, gunpowder and iron pellets had to be reloaded, which was very troublesome, and the procedures were very complicated. When the gun's hammer was pulled, sparks splashed out with a "bang". If the ammunition was not loaded well, and the eyes were aimed at the gun, it would not be fun if sparks splashed into the eyes; so Ming Er didn't even dare to fire, and could only watch them play—then they whistled. Naturally, the dogs near the neighbor's house seemed to know what was happening, wagging their tails and gathering around. They pointed their hands, and the dogs immediately took the lead, chasing along the familiar road while sniffing. The older children who were hunting followed behind, and Ming Er also joined their group.</p>
<p>Their group of four or five people walked past the road where Ming Er cut grass, and then stepped onto an even narrower and winding path, and the surrounding dead grass wrapped around them even more tightly, often rubbing and squeezing against their clothes. Many dogs searched for their target in the weeds using their sharp sense of smell. At this time, they unknowingly left the path and spread out like a skirmish line. The grass grew over their heads, burying them deeply in the middle, serving as a good disguise, but the constant sound of grass and clothes rubbing was very detrimental to their mission. Everyone's guns were already loaded with ammunition, waiting for the command to pull the trigger. Sharp light beams shot out from their eyes like searchlights, running and jumping among the grass; and their ears seemed to have enlarged their auricles, gathering the sound of the dogs; their feet of course also followed the dogs' tracks, speeding up and adopting an encirclement offensive, shrinking the broad battlefield into a narrow range, preparing to concentrate on one point for a fierce attack, and intensified the encirclement. Those sensitive dogs were doing their reconnaissance work everywhere, sometimes sniffing at one point incessantly, which was the trace of the enemy—their target—so they desperately rushed over. Those creatures in the mountains and fields also had sentry lines laid out every five steps and posts every ten steps. At that time, an urgent alarm—the rustling of grass—meant that they were embracing non-resistance and fleeing in all directions. The scouting dog vanguard barked loudly, followed by a burst of gunfire. Clumsy life was shot and sacrificed, becoming food for the dogs. Although they were snatched away, a head had already become a delicious meal for the dogs, bloody and very cruel! This scene of the tragedy of the survival of the fittest etched very deep impressions in Ming Er's mind—hunting is ultimately an act of aggression based on the "strong bullying the weak"! We should resist the aggression of the strong for the innocent and weak!</p>
<h3>Historical Story Comic Strips</h3>
<p>— Shou Ou</p>
<p>Regarding extracurricular reading materials for children, it is indeed a very serious issue, especially in Shanghai, where "comic strip" filled with mythological elements flood the streets, which requires more attention.</p>
<p>The so-called "comic strips" are mostly rented from small book stalls placed at the entrances of alleys. Both the illustrations and texts are extremely crude, the printing is also very bad, and the distortion and fabrication of meanings are self-evident; therefore, for children, there are truly a hundred disadvantages and no advantages. However, children who already know how to read have an unrestrainable desire just like adults, which is the hope to read some interesting books in addition to textbooks; therefore, it is not possible to force them not to rent these "comic strips." The only way is to divert their attention with other publications.</p>
<p>The person in charge of Chunjiang Bookstore started to compile and draw a set of "Historical Story Comic Strips" with this motivation, divided into ten volumes: (1) Yue Fei, (2) Fei Gongren, (3) Gou Jian, (4) Jing Ke, (5) Nie Zheng, (6) Hua Mulan, (7) Wen Tianxiang, (8) Shi Kefa, (9) Qin Liangyu, (10) Qi Jiguang. Just by looking at this list, we can know how valuable the meaning contained in these comic strips is. Now the first volume, Yue Fei, has been published, edited by the primary school education expert Qian Changling, and illustrated by the painter Hu Youfo. The text is so concise and clear, and the illustrations are so vivid and lively. At this time and in this place, it can really be regarded as the most valuable reading material for children.</p>
<h3>The Blue Dwarf (3)</h3>
<p>— Ai Li</p>
<p>A Li thought for a while and then opened his mouth and said, "There's more, didn't we also find the cart pulled by the ox very strange at first? Now that we see strange things, we don't think they are strange anymore, because we are used to seeing them. Ah Li, isn't that so? Hey, Ah Li, come quickly and look, a woman is coming from the street over there, carrying a basket on her back, it's as big as a house, have you ever seen it?" Ah Li was very happy that he seemed to have forgotten the dwarf problem, so she accompanied him to look at the woman carrying the large blue basket.</p>
<p>Ah Li and Ah Li's uncle liked to travel the most, often going to those remote places, unlike other summer vacation travelers who always chose luxurious and lively places. This time, they were traveling in a small village in Germany, and had visited several porcelain factories and glass factories in the vicinity, and saw many novel things. This morning, they had gone to one of the largest porcelain factories and returned very happily, their minds filled with beautiful impressions such as the blue dwarf.</p>
<p>They were now in the best hall in the guest house, which their uncle had booked in advance, intending to stay there for a few days. Their aunt was very tired and was resting on a sofa. The two sisters and brothers sat on the wide windowsill, watching everything passing by on the street outside, which aroused their endless interest.</p>
<p>Hearing them talking incessantly, the aunt suddenly raised her eyes and asked, "What are you two always talking about over there? I seemed to have fallen asleep for a while, but I still heard your voices, like little birds chirping and calling non-stop." Ah Li asked nervously, "Aunt, have we disturbed you?" The aunt quickly said, "No, not at all, but you should come over and tell me what you were just talking about."</p>
<p>Hearing this, A Li immediately thought of the blue dwarf again, and said very seriously, "Aunt, maybe you can explain it more clearly than Ah Li. What I want to ask you is, is there really a country of dwarfs in the world? Are they a kind of fairy? Aunt, please explain it to me clearly." The aunt said very surprised, "A Li, are you talking about dwarfs? A country of dwarfs? What is going on?" Ah Li quickly told the aunt about the blue dwarf she had just mentioned; the aunt listened with great interest.</p>
<p>After Ah Li finished speaking, the aunt said to A Li, "We have seen too many strange things on this trip; we must get used to the unusual and not be overly alarmed. A Li, if you see a dwarf, treat them like ordinary people, call them "Sir," and give them a deep bow, and they will also be very kind and polite to you. Don't think of them as monsters or something like that, and make a joke."</p>
<p>As the aunt was saying this, the door of the living room opened, and their uncle had walked in. He was also a very kind and interesting person. As soon as A Li saw him, he forgot all about the blue dwarf problem and what his aunt had said. He immediately rushed to his uncle's side and asked many questions in a haphazard manner. Finally, he asked what kind of car he was planning to take when he continued traveling, whether it was a truck, and whether he could sit with the driver?

<h3>Establishing Children's Drama</h3>
<p>— Cai Jin</p>
<p>In the past two years—the two years since Shanghai fell—we cannot deny that drama has been very prosperous during this period. Although the harvest may not be entirely satisfactory, it is true that the establishment of large and small drama troupes has at least caused a "boom." Although we cannot currently estimate the success in winning over audiences, there is no doubt that we have neglected the future masters—children. This responsibility should be shouldered not only by every drama worker but also by every person who loves children and culture. Therefore, today, it is necessary to propose the "need for children's drama" and we should make the greatest efforts to establish children's drama and open up a new field.</p>
<p>"Children's drama" is not a flat avenue, especially in the current situation. Dark forces are doing their best to oppress all cultural departments, but we cannot fail to explore and promote the road simply because it is too difficult and arduous; on the contrary, we should meet difficulties with perseverance. Under the condition that our purpose is not harmed, we should use techniques as much as possible to establish children's drama. This method is different from surrender, but rather a flexible combat method.</p>
<p>Doing a job is never something that one or two people or groups can accomplish. Therefore, if we want to "establish children's drama," we need cooperation and efforts from many parties. First, we need to ask colleagues in the drama industry to focus part of their attention on children's drama; second, we require writers of scripts to pay attention to the purpose of educating children, and they must try their best to display children's innocence, and must not restrict or educate children with hypocrisy and forcefulness; because child stars in Chinese movies often have this tendency, which should be especially pointed out. Also, the most important thing in creating scripts is to consider the level of acceptance of children, at least they must be able to understand and endure it, because their immature minds and small hearts do not understand much about society; third, we must do our best to discover and cultivate child actors, because we want to establish children's drama, and it should become children's own drama, and not someone else's. In other words, it is necessary to be autonomous.</p>
<p>This time, the Chinese Drama Research Association is performing children's drama at the Xindu Theater, which is very good news. Although some difficulties are inevitable due to time constraints, scripts and actors, I believe that diligent work will yield good results. At the same time, I hope that everyone will advocate and support children's drama, so that the ideal children's drama can be established as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Yun</p>
<p>Shanghai Should Establish a Theater for Kunqu, Qinqiang, and Peking Opera Performances</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, Shanghai should establish a medium-sized theater. The capital doesn't need to be too much, and the ticket prices shouldn't be too high. Kunqu, Qinqiang, and Peking Opera are combined into one troupe, and their main plays are performed in rotation every day. The plays are also arranged interchangeably, and the ticket price is at most five jiao. The show starts with excellent plays, and the time is about three to four hours. The "anmu" (program listing) is abolished, and tea is provided freely. All the roles that are not trendy but have a solid foundation can be recruited into the troupe. As for Bai Yunsheng, Hou Yongkui, Ma Xianglin, Tao Xianting, and their teams, etc., they only need to be added to the troupe and given some roles. It is much better than when they have problems even drinking porridge. They will definitely be willing to do it. It seems that outstanding talents for Qinqiang roles can still be selected from Tianjin or the Tianqiao area of ​​Beijing. Fortunately, there are not many martial arts plays in Bangzi Opera recently. If you only want to listen to singing plays, not only does the troupe not need many people, but the stage only uses three people who pull the "huhu" (two-stringed fiddle), beat the drums, and knock the clapper.</p>
<p>If this theater is realized, it is expected that the business will be very prosperous. On the audience side, they can listen to various types of dramas at extremely low prices, which will refresh their ears and eyes. At the same time, the actors of Kunqu, Qinqiang, and Peking Opera can also learn from each other, which will not only preserve drama but also bring hope for the balanced development of various local dramas in China. Those with ambition can try it. — (116)</p>
<h3>Wang Xiawen and Tang Ruoqing Arrive in Shanghai Together</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Proving That Previous Rumors Were Untrue, They Will Guest Star in Plays at a Certain Theater</p>
<p>The "China Traveling Theater" (Zhong Lü) 's long-term performances at the Carlton Theater have made indelible contributions to the revival of spoken drama in Shanghai. It has not only won over the audience of civilized plays but has also influenced the acting skills of civilized play practitioners. For example, Jiang Ming's "Lu Gui style" and Tang Ruoqing's dialogue cadence have now become the acting textbook for general clowns and female roles.</p>
<p>After the War of Resistance, they left Shanghai, and many unfortunate news came: such as the friction between Guang Huaiqiu and Jiang Ming, and the separation of Guang Ruoyu and Wang Xiawen. Now, the former news has been confirmed, but the two people who separated still each stick to their posts and work hard for the drama movement—Tang Huaiqiu is about to return to Shanghai, and Jiang Ming has joined the Dadi Film Company in Hong Kong. As for the latter, recent Shanghai newspapers have also seen records of this young couple going their separate ways; however, the day before yesterday, Tang Ruoqing and Wang Xiawen still returned to Shanghai very affectionately, which is indeed good news worth reporting to the audience who care about them.</p>
<p>They came back to Shanghai this time to accompany the "Zhong Lü" mother Wu Jing, because Wu Jing was not used to life in Hong Kong and returned to Shanghai to live for a long time. Tang Ruoqing and Wang Xiawen also took this opportunity to return and have a reunion with friends in Shanghai. The author met the couple somewhere yesterday, and when I told them the rumors, they smiled without answering. In fact, this return is the best answer to prove the rumors.</p>
<p>Their stay in Shanghai this time is very short, but they themselves cannot determine when they will leave. And some friends have already negotiated with Tang Ruoqing, inviting her to guest star in a play at a certain theater during this short period. Tang Ruoqing said that as long as time permits, she will definitely appear on stage. It is estimated that the chance of success is over 80 percent. Once the opportunity is ripe, the author will report their whereabouts at any time.</p>
