<h3>德義的政治談話和歐局</h3>
<p>當英國進退惶惑，日本擒縱未定，英日兩國東京談判停頓的時候，德義兩國又商量着在歐洲有所新作為。其地，離慕尼黑不遠的薩爾資堡；其人，德國方面是外長里賓特洛甫，義國方面是外長齊亞諾，而德國元首希特勒亦兩度躬親其事；時在本月十一日起，共計進行談話歷三日；「以極端友好之精神，討論現行各項政治問題。」自從德義軍事同盟成立後，這是兩國間最重要的一次談話。這次談話表現着侵略集團的確挣扎不息，向那發育尙未健全的反侵略陣綫示威；同時暗示着歐洲新危機的行將蒞臨。在另一方面，據倫敦「金融時報」所報吿，「墨索里尼當在最近將來，提議召集國際會議，以改善英法德義四國關係，」又據法國菲迦羅報載稱，「華沙盛傳齊亞諾曾向里賓特洛甫提出解決但澤爭案的折衷辦法，」這兩說雖未經證實，但是僅此空氣，也許便可使夢寐縈迴於推行綏靖政策，締結四强公約的張伯倫怦然心動。脅誘並進，這是有效的老藥方，可以不用外科手術而奏效的魔術治療法，可是病象今昔不同，這次也許無效了！</p>
<p>這次談話的結果除了發表一個空洞的公報外，照例對於內容是並不宣布的。據外電所傳，雙方所討論的主要問題共有三項：（一）但澤問題；（二）向德義軸心表示同情之各國，尤其是匈牙利，南斯拉夫，保加利亞三國，應以德義軸心為中心，並在政治上加以組織，以反抗「包圍政策」問題；（三）日本加入德義軍事盟約問題。這三項，雖無公報證實，却是題中應有之義。何况德國因為內在矛盾的深刻，惟有對外不息的冒險；自從攖取米美爾，以結東所謂春季運動之後．夏季儘唱文戲，流些汗，未有收穫；而今而後，又該是秋風胡馬當令了。且看它如何揚鞭馳騁！</p>
<p>但澤嗎？這是希特勒志在必得的碩果；據它們說，得與不得，是德國榮譽有關的問題，而問題却在波蘭具有抵抗侵略的決心，且波蘭又與英國結有互助公約；如果用兵的話，僅用儀仗兵來接收是不夠的，不免要流了血纔知成敗。幾個月來，德國處心積慮，想了種種方式來嘗試，種種辦法來攫取；在這次薩爾資堡談話中，柏林目的顯在取得羅馬的支持，原來義國執鞭隨鐙，不止一次了。這幾天來，羅馬報紙大事鼓吹但澤歸德的理由，却又盛傳「墨索里尼正設法緩和德．元首所行的政策，並勸其勿以引起戰爭的手段，實現其領土要求；」這與去年九月，羅馬報紙鼓吹蘇台德區歸德，而墨索里尼「勸吿」希特勒切勿冒險，謹愼將事，情形完全一樣。</p>
<p>又據法國方面的消息：「德國對於但澤自由市所進行之行動，僅為一種烟幕彈，實則東南歐方面現正醖釀重大事故。」這不是沒有根據的。在這次薩爾資堡談話中，德義共謀加緊控制匈牙利和南斯拉夫，顯是一個中心的問題。原來南匈兩國，雖因地理與歷史的關係，一天天被拉入軸心；但另一方面，任何獨立國家，當然不甘附庸，却還想與英法接近，儘量擺脫軸心的控制。匈牙利攝政雀爾第的取締國內納粹黨，南國保祿親王的訪問倫敦，就是明證。這一切，是希特勒所必欲加以﹁抵銷」的。老實說，希特勒要控制歐洲，南斯拉夫和匈牙利在軍略上的地位比但澤還重要，因為它們是巴爾幹半島的橋梁。義國法西斯黨人明白說：「歐洲時局失其均衡，多瑙河巴爾幹半島的問題亟待澄淸！」所以，從這次義德談話以後，巴爾幹的危機，也是日形迫切了。</p>
<p>至於日本加入德義軍事盟約問題，最近是日本方面主動，而德義表示冷淡。本報己經再三中論，意猶有未盡，容別為評述。今日祇說歐局，則總括一句話：在法西斯侵略者聯合的陰謀之下，歐洲正醖釀着新的危機。在薩爾資堡，我們已望見了危機的暗影。</p>
<h3>英日東京談判　陷於若即若離狀態　日軍代表武藤飛返天津　臨行談話盡脅誘之能事</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　外傳日本政府業已照會英國、謂華北法幣與天津存銀問題、一日不能解決、則日本卽一日拒不與英國賡續談判、此說頃由政府中人予以否認、並謂政府業以新訓令電達駐日大使克萊琪爵士允交出天津四華籍嫌疑犯、並就英租界警務行政間題有所訓示、英日兩國代表下次會晤時、當可依照訓令內容、賡績討諭警權問題、至日方發言人所發出之聲明、倘不列入正式公報、卽未便認其為有法律性質之拘東力云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>福州通讀、福建七大特產中、松木為第二位、出產數量和價値、僅次於茶葉、松木為產區、計閩江流域、為浦城·建甌·邵武·將樂·永安·沙縣·南平·尤溪·大田·屏南·德化·永泰等縣、汀江流域、為連城·武平·上杭·永定等縣·漳平等縣、其他流域、為平和寗德等縣、其中以閩江流域的尤溪和永泰·及龍江流域的漳平、出產為最高額、閩江流域的松木、皆運集福州、而後輸銷於各地、汀江流域、則多由龍溪轉輸於潮州汕頭、處產的價值、大約有七百萬元之讚、</p>
<p>採運的方式、是由木號於每年冬末、携款往各個山上採購、在深山大谷之中、採運松木之木客、在松木成筒之後、按筒售與木號、每筒（卽每條）價値、視尾徑大小而定、大約每筒圓徑在三尺左右者、可値二元五角至三元、木號採購後、因木筒笨重、非人力所能搬運、乃托入山谷附近能搬運、乃拖入山谷附近之大小坑漳流中、利用春夏雨水力量、撑放於大江河內、但漳小水淺、水力不够浮動松筒、故於沿坑之兩磅、每三四十步、建築簡易的士壩、積貯坑水、以為浮筒之用、壩的建造極簡、只將三五松筒、橫疊或直豎坑中、混合泥土與靑草、塡塞筒之空隙處、使其不漏水卽可、每一小漳、兩沿土壩的數量、輙有數十或二三百不等、</p>
<p>松筒撑放至江邊、江闊而深、卽可封釘成排、假潮運往各個目的地、此為松木成筒及採運之情况、</p>
<p>松筒成排、都適値春夏之交、洪流時漲、溪洪氾濫、盧舍為墟、而小坑之土壩疊被冲毀漂蕩、江邊之松筒、更難逃浩刧、成排未排之松筒、隨波下流、沿閩江而下、漂出大海者、往往皆是、間亦有少許刁狡商民、利用溪洪暴漲之汛、放排下流、冀免賦稅之繳納、亦不在少數也、</p>
<p>今年四度溪洪、正日艦封鎖海口之時、木號方趦趄出口之艱難、而人力所難防禦之洪災、遂造成空前的損失、據關係方面累計達二十萬餘筒之多、每筒平均以五元計、値國幣一百三十萬元、誠浩刧也、</p>
<p>松筒下流、多為沿江鄕民所撈拾、歷年習慣、係由松木商人聯合組織「松木商贖木經理處」之集團、於沿江各縣區鎭、分設代理處、專管撈拾及備價取贖等事宜、卽為善後補救的方法、贖木的價値、零星筒數、視尾徑大小而定、每筒大約由二角至三角、整排取贖、每筒只一角多、</p>
<p>今年溪洪啣接暴漲、水勢兇猛、逐流漂入海中、為數甚多、而為沿江撈拾者極少、更兼閩侯縣轄江口·浦口·沙堤·等鄕豪覇、乘機强　佔、盜毀為薪木之用、亦不在少數、毀「嘜」轉售、為數亦達五六萬筒、木號贖回及自己撈拾所得、為數只有漂失之一半、</p>
<p>松木為閩省特產之一、對於閩省經濟、極關重要、聞當局已嚴令沿江各縣政府、嚴密妥籌善後辦法、對於漂流樹木、嚴禁强佔、以利木商、</p>
<h3>擾閩日軍　在平潭登陸後種種　海匪首領任僞總司令　民衆多被拘押及虐待</h3>

<h3>天津四華人命運　期待英按署裁決　瓊思推事仍在悉心研究　情勢迫切將於今日判決　呈請人或須上訴英倫</h3>
<p>因東京英日談判而牽涉之日方要求天津四華人引渡事件、英政府已於十一日夜下令將該四嫌疑人由天津英租界當局移交於該處「華北政權、」正當國際間對英方此項舉措紛粉詫愕之際、本埠英國駐華按察使署適據本埠愛理思大律師公館著名英籍律師李克斯接耶路撒冷大學國際關係敎授邊特威及英國廣播公司董事佛蘭女士之來電、呈請保護人身法令狀、因此各方關心之津四華人引渡案、又均集中硯力於英按察使之如何决定、茲將昨日續得各訊、分誌如下、</p>
<p>今日或將　宣吿判決</p>
<p>英國按察使署述呈請後、當由推事瓊思運日對本案詳加研究、並於十二日下午、與李克斯大律師辯論此項呈請、昨日推事瓊思繼續對本案辯護人所提之理由、加以研究、截至昨晚為止、英按察使署對此案尙未有判决之消息、亦無關於此事之任何正式文件公表、一般預料因此案在情勢上亟待處理，故或將於今（十五）日宣布其判決文件、</p>
<p>萬一失敗　上訴英倫</p>
<p>關心本案者對於按察使署之如何判決、現尙難有所獲悉、但據消息靈通之西籍人士方面所得消息、謂本案前途、如英按察使署認為呈請人提出之「保護人身法令狀」之請求適合、則即循此送徑進行、設按察使署對此項請求、或加以判駁者、則該呈請人勢將繼續上訴於英國倫敦高級法院、以期貫澈其請求之原意、</p>
<p>保護人身　法令詮釋</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、關於天津四華箱嫌疑犯引渡予該埠日當局事、上週向上海英國按察使署提出之「保護人身法令狀」、所謂保護人身法令狀者、乃按照英國法律、由高等法院發出之令狀、命受狀者將其所禁之人之本身、押赴該高等法院、或其他法院審間、用以保護人權、終止一切違法監禁、乃破壞個人自由之補救法也、此案昨日尙未加以判決、查此項審斷、係辯護人李克斯向推事瓊斯提出耍求者、今（十四日）晨瓊斯推事仍在研究此事、或將於明日（十五日）宣布判決文</p>
<p>此案在華　絕無僅有</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、著名英人愛理思律師公館之瓊思與李克斯兩律師星期六日向英國駐華按察使署推事瓊斯提出呈請、衆認此項呈請、為駐華英國法律訴訟上所絕無僅有、而或係天津四華籍嫌疑犯之命運所繫、非特在上海、即在倫敦與東京亦懷最大之關切、以待判決、</p>
<p>英國移交　引起責難</p>
<p>查是呈項請、與數月前「臨時政府」一華員被刺案之四華人有關、此輩嫌疑犯、現遭天津英當局覊禁、彼等之移交日軍及北平「臨時政府」當軸事、始終遭英當局反對、而於已往一週餘中、已成東京英日談判之一部份、英政府下令交出嫌疑犯之決定、巳在英國引起某種訾議、國際間關係敎授邊特威與英國廣播公司董事事佛蘭女士亦起而反對、</p>
<p>瓊思判詞　甚關重要</p>
<p>星期五日夜接邊特威與佛女士來電、託提出片面的呈請、要求對保護人身法令狀作附有條件的判決、此項呈請於星期六日晨向推事瓊思提出、而瓊思與李克斯曾以星期六日整個下午辯論此呈請事、瓊思推事嗣主延期判決、觀於局勢急不容緩、而有迅即判決之必要、衆信瓊思推事將於今（十四日）或明日（十五日）判決、此項呈請要求以保護人身法令狀頒發覊禁四嫌疑犯之天津英租界工部局警務官員、一般人指稱、若附條件的判決一經發出、則該判決或為須履行者、或使之為獨立自存者、故衆認瓊思推事之判決、甚關重要也、</p>
<h3>一部份敎職員　呼籲加薪　要求援照各辦法　酌加學費以資彌袖</h3>
<p>本市敎育界戴仰仁·金竟·周錦濤·李純一·朱華甫·戴芝江·等百餘人、鑒於在此物價飛漲聲中、敎育界工作人員、大多難以維持生計、特對此事聯名表示意見云、自前年戰事爆發後、滬上除原有學校外、淪陷區內之學校、亦相率遷移來滬、覓屋開學、使弦歌不致中輟、對社會國家、</p>
<p>略盡職責、平日各校同仁、均能一本同舟共濟精神、渡過難關、惟是目前外滙暴縮、衣食住行各方面、相繼加價至五成八成、多數廠商行號、對於職員薪給、已先後增加、藉資彌補、回顧敎育界、往常本甚淸苦、多數在半飢飽的狀態下過活、際此非常時期、有的竟連</p>
<p>起碼生活、難於維持、遑論仰事俯蓄心想吃水」活命、可是「自來水」也在漲價呢、我們以客觀的公正的立塲說、在目前、敎員跟其他機關職員實在一樣的、需要提高待遇、即在學校本身、也同樣需要增加收入、才能應付支出、有人說、增加學費、就是加重家屬負担、然而祗要把頭腦鎭靜、就會領悟、因為一般</p>
<p>薪水階級</p>
<p>者、他們原有的薪水提高了、支出增加些、並不是一件不合理的事、如果他家裹原屬有錢的資產階級、那更不成問題、社會上均能如此合理的分配、也就是符合了經濟學上「收支平衡」的原則、試問一個敎師的生活不安定、何能安心任事、所以照我們的意見、一般學校敎職員、平日薪給在水準以下的、確有立即發動加薪的必要、在學校方面、不妨在學費項下、酌量增加、以資彌補、吾則</p>
<p>各業加薪、獨敎育界向隅、那未免厚彼而薄此、使一般平日本巳淸苦的敎職員、何以為生、希望社會公團、熱心人士、予以積極救濟、</p>

<h3>猶太難民　不復准許來滬　工部局認為工作業已盡力　由他處加以援助此其時矣</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、工部局頃商決不復准許歐洲猶太難民入上海、業巳登輪啟程之難民、有除外可能、工部局業已致函所有領署·輪船公司及海耶木氏、（轉交上海各猶太人團體）吿知局方之決定、據工部局發言人今日（十四日）語記者稱、上海為歐洲難民而從事之工作、</p>
<p>業已足矣、切弗以為工部局對難民、不予同情、然上海不復能吸收難民、以免市政事務到達受重累之點、如所傳日當局不復准移民殖居蘇州河北岸之非正式消息屬實、則蘇州河北岸當然無</p>
<p>彼等容身之餘地、工部局對難民未予經濟上的大量援助、本埠猶太人團體援助移民、工作頗佳、工部局則以空屋與空地給予使用、籍以相助、然大批難民之突然抵此、使事務冗繁之警務處又得</p>
<p>額外工作而智囊期內無限制難民到來、將使一切市政事務復添煩累、如醫藥服務有大增之必要、即其一例、上海所為、巳逾其份、由他人加以援助、此其時矣、工部局雖明瞭難民或以為上海一切將較彼等離去地之情况為佳、然難民羣來此未為彼等作</p>
<p>妥善準備之市、對於難民自身亦有不利影響、業巳登輪之難民不致迫使他去、為人道之理由、當准彼等入境云、按來自德奧之猶太難民巳抵上海者、共的一萬五千人、據工部局作此決定前之預料、本年內復有五千人將到來、今晨估計業已首途來滬者、有五百人、若輩將為最後一批准入公共租界之難民、</p>

<h3>物價騰高中　上海的另一角落</h3>
<p>— 文琴</p>
<p>小菜塲點心攤巡禮</p>
<p>為了要找些新奇的嘗試，特在一個仲夏的淸晨，提着菜籃，携着小傘，不用隨員，隻身到附近的白克路小菜塲去買菜，乘便在旁邊作了一個點心攤的巡禮。在百物昂貴的現在，當然，這點心之類的東西，也被捲入漲價苦悶的漩渦裏了。從攤主們的訴苦聲裏，摘錄些鱗爪，也可以算是一個社會另一角的報道吧。</p>
<p>因為時間尙早，白克路上行人還稀，三三兩兩的娘姨大姐們和裝滿了菜蔬的獨輪車，以及送貨的脚踏車暫時點綴着這靜謐的街道。白克路梅白格路的三义路口豎着一塊牌子「單乘車輛，此路只准由南向北，不准由北向南』這塊牌子居小菜塲的西北角上向南數去十來個門面和向東數去二十來個門面，長寬相乘，便是這小菜塲的面積了。這個小菜塲規模不及八仙橋小菜塲的偉大，市面還不及陳家浜小菜塲的繁榮但是也算小巧玲瓏，不失為一個上乘的小菜塲。如果嫌別的菜塲煩擾，也不妨到這裹去採辦，準會給你滿意的收穫呢！</p>
<p>就在這菜塲的北面邊緣上，排列着各色的點心攤基，冷熱葷素乾濕，莫不應有盡有，蔚為大觀。其中以大餅攤為最多，的佔其十之三四而强，我因知道大餅近來漲成二分一個了，想從他們從業者的口裏知道些其他情形，於是走近一個餅攤。先買了兩塊大餅，果然比以前大得多了旁邊還有比油穌餅的直徑長二分的圓餅是一分一塊。其時一個老婆子正在煮着一塊薄餅，我就以恭而且誠的態度問她「老奶奶，這呌什麽餅？』於是她的話匣打開了，她說這是油餅，一毛錢一塊，以前是五分一塊；旁邊厚而且硬的名呌强（不知是吾此字）餅，要賣五毛錢一個，這是切開來另賣的；油條二分一根。她說油條比以前長多了，又說到麵粉之貴，以前買三元一袋，如今要買六元多一袋了；芝蔴一元兩斤，從前可以買到四斤五斤哩，煤屑一担價錢四元餘，以前不過兩元就可以了。這時她的油餅已經煮好，把扁鍋往上一提，我發現下面燒的是煤球她又申說這個爐身淺，不適宜於燒煤屑，她又沉痛的說：「唉，煤球也貴了呢，三元三角一担！」她眞摯的看着我，我同情的點了點頭。</p>
<p>右首的芳鄰是一個粥攤，一碗碗熱騰騰的白粥，還有綠豆粥蹲在板檯上，桌傍坐了幾個苦力，正在噓噓的喝着粥。過粥菜有黃豆，花生，乳腐和皮蛋，除前三者有主顧賞光外，皮蛋却無人顧問。一大碗粥售價四分，一小碟豆二分，一小塊乳腐一分，祗要化六分錢算可以買一個飽了，挺實惠。剛要轉身走去，瞥見桌上的玻璃框子裏有一張鮮明的紅紙，祇見上面寫着疏疏的幾行小字，我還記得「諸位顧客，請原諒，六分找進，七分找出，本主人白。」眞覺直率可愛，不過我不大明白牠的眞意，大概是關於郵票和毛票的問題了。（未完）</p>

<p>敎唆墮胎</p>
<p>帮助墮胎等罪、在進行審判期間、陸忽敎唆女傭徐沈氏到案作證、冒認為馬采貞之舅母、又敎唆李周氏冒充為馬之生母、證明馬女祇十九歲、無自訴能力、擬推翻前案、幷在民庭訴請確認馬采貞為親生女、經判決原吿之訴駁回、故馬復</p>
<p>具狀補控</p>
<p>陸芹生·李周氏·徐沈氏等敎唆偽證等罪、被吿等亦延許武芳律師·孫祖基律師·辯護、該案初審、經繆慶邦推事審結、判決陸邢氏處有期徒刑六月、陸芹生避不到案、出票通緝在案、共餘部份無罪、自奉判後、雙方</p>

<h3>颶風在福州登陸　趨勢消散　祇剩一個風力　並不感覺猛烈</h3>
<p>太平洋新起颶風、於昨晨凌晨間登陸後、午後即進至福州之西面、有趨消散之勢、據徐家匯天文臺於昨晨六時報吿、颶風已抵北緯二十五度半、東經一百十九度半之處、方向西北西、中心在三十海哩以內、查爾時適為颶風開始在福州登陸之時間也、</p>
<p>上海亦　受影響</p>
<p>當國風登陸時、福州所感受之風力、並不猛烈、祇四個風力之譜、其時上海氣候、亦突呈陰晦、九時許、且降陣雨、蓋即受颶風在福州登陸、風勢分散之影響、比得昨午後二時天文臺報吿、颶風巳進抵福州以西、為北緯二十六度、東經一百十九度之處，中止在六十海哩以內、方向仍為西北四、</p>
<p>另一颶　風行進</p>
<p>颶風登陸後之發展、顯然趨向滬散、因福州昨日午後、所剩餘之風威、已祇一個風力也、故推測即將歸於消滅、惟太平洋瓜姆島附近、新起一氏風、亦向西北西進行、距滬甚遠、故其趨向風力、均尙未悉、又昨日本埠最高溫度為九十一度八、最低為七十五度、</p>

<p>收集字紙、視為積德、且劃入慈善事業之中、更包羅吃素·唸經·等事、迄目前該局自置房產、藉以維持、不至恃捐款、工作現雖停止、但尙有職員若干人留用、有魏軒耀·方運志·兩人、平日方對魏之處理局務、頗有不滿其行為之處、每多直言勸諫、因是</p>
<p>時生衝突、最近有香港同道中人滕雲山投函、致彼等數人、談及局務、詎魏竟將信不許方之索閱、而方以本人亦屬收信人之一、有權閱看、遂起爭論、魏即糾合其姪偉南及女傭黃氏用木凳脚將方痛毆、以洩積恨、致方全身受傷、即投特二法院檢察處</p>
<p>請求騐傷，後在原法院刑庭提起自訴魏軒耀等傷害罪、而魏亦提起反訴傷害、妨害名譽、初審結果、判魏處罰金、並賠償醫十藥費、方無罪在案、乃魏不服判決、向高三分院</p>
<p>提起上訴、方委朱學譽。丘傑秀兩律師出庭辯護、此案現經高院合議庭審理終結、於昨日判决、魏軒耀等上訴駁回、緩刑二年、附帶民訴部份、兩方均予駁斥、</p>

<p>券暗盤、昨日市况又趨恍惚、初一此前暗中相</p>
<p>等、頓又回小一元、震盪不已、</p>
<p>無非在一二元間盤旋、檯面多</p>
<p>空胃量、眼光亦祇在此小範圍</p>
<p>內、故行市暫時未必有鉅大上</p>
<p>落、先令漸鬆、金子漸疲、公債</p>
<p>亦未能興奮、收盤後、　聞英日</p>
<p>談判決裂、幷謠言新借款有希</p>
<p>望、故暗中行市又趨高六七角</p>
<p>消息、瞬息萬變、投機份子莫衷</p>
<p>一是、故趨勢當有盤旋狀態也、</p>
<p>昨日經過開盤行市、比隔日好</p>
<p>起七八角、聯和及散戶買進、後</p>
<p>以四十二號及天生乘高賣出、</p>
<p>市氣頓衰、雖震康茂春及散戶</p>
<p>買進、無如又有中一大慶及聯</p>
<p>和賣出、價仍不支、驟瀉一元、</p>
<p>收盤價比隔日猶小二三角至六</p>
<p>角不等、但收市後人心轉佳、復</p>
<p>又回好五六七角不等、成交總</p>
<p>數約計四五十萬元、茲列簡明</p>
<p>表於後、</p>
<p>股</p>
<p>票交易、成交紗布交易所股二百股、價為三十</p>
<p>六元五角、</p>
<p>衆業公所昨日上午為交割、</p>
<p>下午開盤、交易時開極短、市氣</p>
<p>稍見疲弱、成交價格讀形低廉、</p>
<p>綠以日本陸軍代表離去東京、</p>
<p>英日議會破裂、又以外滙趨勢</p>
<p>稍鬆、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗市安謐　成交都實需要　集會辦法磋商中</h3>
<p>棉</p>
<p>紗現貨平靜、加之外匯放長、人心更定、市塲已</p>
<p>趨安謐、至於公會、雖吿停閉、</p>
<p>然客帮辦貨、先由直接電話詢</p>
<p>問價値、而後定奪、其餘掮客</p>
<p>奔走客帮接洽、因是成交者亦</p>
<p>有之、故所有交易都係實際、皮</p>
<p>球交易驟形减縮、華南香港帮</p>
<p>需要繼續不懈、其他帮口採辦</p>
<p>殊鮮、</p>
<p>現</p>
<p>紗晨初開市、在紗號邊廊中、三五成羣、聚談</p>
<p>議論市價、據捐客言、廣帮稍有</p>
<p>納胃、然還價甚低、二十支雙馬</p>
<p>喊價為七百元要進、相持已久、</p>
<p>執貨都不肯賣出、旋後又復回</p>
<p>升、查廣帮香港帮買去、約計四</p>
<p>五百包、十五日棉紗八十件運</p>
<p>海防、行情二十支雙馬跌三元、</p>
<p>雙地球跌五元、</p>
<p>午</p>
<p>後消息、棉紗此後買賣之切實辦法、目下正在</p>
<p>分頭磋商接洽中、一時恐不易</p>
<p>正式成立也、</p>
<p>現</p>
<p>紗情形尙佳、二十支雙馬現貨廣帮仍吃、而價</p>
<p>為七百二十五元、比上午價再</p>
<p>漲三三元、但三時以後、因外匯轉</p>
<p>長、黃金下降市况轉疲、又據某</p>
<p>跑街云、莊客接得北海電訊、止</p>
<p>裝止辦說、原因謂該處情形不</p>
<p>寗云、</p>
<h3>生產現狀</h3>
<p>自中日全面戰爭爆發以來、</p>
<p>孤島型的上海棉紗市塲、日在</p>
<p>畸形發展之中、引起囤積居奇</p>
<p>者的操縱和壟斷、加之外匯黑</p>
<p>市塲的暴縮、紗價（二十支紗）</p>
<p>從四百多元向五百元六百元一</p>
<p>直暴騰至現貨做開七百四十元</p>
<p>的駭人聽聞的最高峯、開紗廠</p>
<p>事業創始到現在數十年來紗價</p>
<p>未有如此的新紀錄、顧實際的</p>
<p>銷路如何、大部華紗行銷市塲</p>
<p>（紗銷區域）已非我有、侷躋於</p>
<p>西南一角、與戰前相此較、實在</p>
<p>狹隘得可憐、少得悽慘、目前的</p>
<p>紗貴原因、是人為的博注、和外</p>
<p>匯黑市塲掀風作浪所釀成的、</p>
<p>（有人誤認為中國幣制問題的</p>
<p>搖動使然、實則似是而非也、）</p>
<p>中國紗實際銷路、如香港、廣</p>
<p>州灣、昆明、重慶等地、日僅數</p>
<p>百包、最多時亦不過偶然的千</p>
<p>餘包而已、孤島的棉紗投機市</p>
<p>塲、旣經經濟部電令制止而停</p>
<p>頓、奸商暗中活動、多少總不無</p>
<p>有些顧忌、此後正當之紗商、要</p>
<p>着重實際的現貨買賣了、眼前</p>
<p>囤積外棧的現紗（包括紗號囤</p>
<p>戶金融業等手中）不下十萬多</p>
<p>包、而特區區裏各華商紗廠的生</p>
<p>產量的現狀如何、大家所急欲</p>
<p>知的、茲探訪如次、（以二十支</p>
<p>紗產量而言）</p>
<p>依據上述統計華商紗廠的每</p>
<p>天、（日夜）實開紡錠、共達三十</p>
<p>七萬錘左右、日夜生產二十支</p>
<p>紗達二十六萬五千五百磅、以</p>
<p>每件紗份四百二十磅折算、生</p>
<p>產額達六百三十二包左右、一</p>
<p>個月的產量約有一九、〇〇〇</p>
<p>包左右了、以之應付實銷、不過</p>
<p>如此、而外棧現貨的儲存額十</p>
<p>萬包左右、勢將食而不化了、不</p>
<p>日紗價的反動劇跌、一二百元</p>
<p>的向下直瀉勢所必然也、一般</p>
<p>有錢囤戶、何苦如此扳磚磕脚、</p>
<p>自害害人害消費者哉、（龍）</p>
<h3>棉花售價過高　交易不甚暢達</h3>
<p>中外棉花交易、尙堪維持、</p>
<p>但售盤因紗價回挫、二</p>
<p>則因外匯放長、致人心巳趨穩</p>
<p>定、市塲大為寗靜、華廠德豐廠</p>
<p>進郵包彰德花五百包、價為一</p>
<p>百六十二元（現鈔）、英廠怡和</p>
<p>亦進印棉幾百件、同業中互相</p>
<p>買賣不及昔日之量矣、態度轉</p>
<p>趨和平、市價亦稍見疲、蘇北來</p>
<p>源計通花二百二十六包、又天</p>
<p>津來四十包、茲將現棉售開情</p>
<p>形錄左、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、昨因匯兌放長、拆合法幣棉</p>
<p>價俱跌、惟同業間心意頗高、暫</p>
<p>時無意出售、而廠方亦以棉花</p>
<p>售價尙高、故購意殊為鬆懈、然</p>
<p>照目前情形、滬上存底較薄、滙</p>
<p>兌尙不致過於放長、故原棉售</p>
<p>價亦不至猛跌、惟將來紗廠之</p>
<p>减工及廠方定貨湧到時、則其</p>
<p>售價殊可慮也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、日來</p>
<p>甚無起色、昨又因各方</p>
<p>之套賣及多頭了結、市况疲乏、</p>
<p>加之華爾街之軟弱、市價始終</p>
<p>未能振起結果跌去六六七磅音、</p>
<p>印度市况頗堅定、連同預測漲</p>
<p>一羅比半、埃及棉市平定、</p>
<h3>疋頭　市盤不敷成本　廠方拒開期貨　囤貨之風亦戢</h3>
<p>國布　布市投機囤貨之</p>
<p>風稍戢然市盤以</p>
<p>廠方難敷成本、拒</p>
<p>開期貨、因之同業及廠家存貨</p>
<p>售盤續昂、錢呢·色布每疋漲三</p>
<p>五角、白貨平平、惟怡和十六磅</p>
<p>雙象粗布由山東帮搜購四五十</p>
<p>包、售盤漲二角半、餘檔輕重磅</p>
<p>粗布每疋亦帶高一角至二角半</p>
<p>、粵帮辦鴻章·大新·華豐等廠</p>
<p>出品綫呢·色布色斜六百餘箱、</p>
<p>國外暹暹·星加坡帮辦漂染斜</p>
<p>紋·細布四千數百疋、本街批發</p>
<p>號進細布·細斜粗布漂染布二</p>
<p>百餘件、川滇需胃甚淡、北路津</p>
<p>帮以津案談判頓挫、兼有水災、</p>
<p>各貨無意購辦、祇在了結定貨</p>
<p>手續、</p>
<p>東疋　白貨細布·細斜昨</p>
<p>以實銷平庸、售盤</p>
<p>回挫、較上週每疋</p>
<p>降落一角至二負半、十二磅龍</p>
<p>頭細布現貨為十八元九角至十</p>
<p>九元、本月份索價十九元五角、</p>
<p>下月份二十元、寶貝細斜十六</p>
<p>元二負半、天津帮祇有轉出、秦</p>
<p>皇島稍有添額、出勢已漸呆滯、</p>
<p>故運本街交易、全日做開僅四</p>
<p>五百件、但色貨·嗶嘰·直貢貢比</p>
<p>較穏定、</p>

<p>三千包、到貨旣夥、更以連朝</p>
<p>市面暴漲、似應略平、但米價</p>
<p>仍不肯放鬆、售賣甚至停頓、頗</p>
<p>使一般居民有買米維艱之嘆、</p>
<p>傳聞錫粳開二十八元八負、蘇</p>

<p>包、不過晚市略緊、又有加起三</p>
<p>五角不等、</p>
<p>麵粉　昨日本街需要頗熱烈</p>
<p>、因米糧恐慌聲中、各米店附帶</p>
<p>出售麵食、以麵代米、銷化益</p>
<p>增、而各粉廠趁此居奇、二號粉</p>
<p>廠盤已達六元大關、比上週末</p>
<p>再升二角、聞客帮要求開售者、</p>
<p>均被廠方拒絕、故客盤仍仍不開、</p>
<p>又聞回節貨棧單市七更為俏利</p>
<p>、蓋目下雖已看到六元、但看漲</p>
<p>者尤不乏人、業外囤戶、收買仍</p>
<p>不察寞也、今日有一萬二千包</p>
<p>運往塘沽、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日廠辦續健、本街</p>
<p>囤戶收買者亦不絕、惟雜糧公</p>
<p>會停市、故無正式交易、聞送廠</p>
<p>貨售價又高一二角、中次麥均</p>
<p>須八元以上之價云、</p>

<p>金山元枝、以新貨歉收、產價</p>
<p>奇昂、如再加山香港轉申、運費</p>

<h3>遺精的根本療法　性病專科醫師詹念曾</h3>
<p>因為我們知道有許多江湖</p>
<p>醫生為人治病，徒敷衍於一時</p>
<p>，這雖然適應了病家錯誤的心</p>
<p>理，而飽了他的私囊，但人家</p>
<p>的生命，就等於我的生命，病</p>
<p>家抱了痛苦來求治，而醫生反</p>
<p>玩弄他把他生命當兒戲，豈不</p>
<p>罪大惡極？</p>
<p>遺精一症，雖無痛癢，但</p>
<p>其結果却有萬分危險！世間眞</p>
<p>不知有多少靑年，就葬送在遺</p>
<p>精失治後的痛苦深淵中。靑年</p>
<p>人何以有遺精，不外為下列諸</p>
<p>種原因：（一）手淫放縱，（二）</p>
<p>早婚縱慾；（三）先天衰弱病後</p>
<p>失調；（四）用腦用力過度以及</p>
<p>憂傷太甚等。以上原因中尤以</p>
<p>手淫縱慾的原因最居多數。因</p>
<p>為此種勾當最易傷害性神經，</p>
<p>使精關鬆弛，遺精症即繼之而</p>
<p>起。</p>
<p>遺精一起，即應作根本治</p>
<p>療之計，萬不可因循苟且。因</p>
<p>遺精日久，精關機能必格外鬆</p>
<p>弛，由此而造成滑精漏精症者</p>
<p>實多不勝計，然而元氣也就大</p>
<p>虧了。於是凡腦衰健忘，失眠</p>
<p>心悸，腰酸背痛，腎萎早洩，</p>
<p>發育不全，未老先衰等症象即</p>
<p>相繼而來，此種男子必然形容</p>
<p>憔悴，多痛多病，受盡苦楚，</p>
<p>求學習業，一無成就，前途黯</p>
<p>淡！在男女之間，且將為女性</p>
<p>所吐棄，為妻子所憎恨，人生</p>
<p>幸福，喪盡無餘！</p>
<p>關於遺精的根本療法，日</p>
<p>常生活的注意攝生，如戒絕自</p>
<p>凟，不讀淫書淫畫，勤運動，</p>
<p>常用冷水洗滌局部，均有裨益</p>
<p>，但特效藥藥物亦屬必要。據世</p>
<p>界名醫及余經騐，均以為服「</p>
<p>希米脫氏固精片」，則確有鞏</p>
<p>固精關，鎭靜神經，安眠止遺</p>
<p>之效。如因遺精已有上述症象</p>
<p>者，則須兼服生殖腺素製劑「</p>
<p>生殖素」以培補腦腎，精血及</p>
<p>神經，繼繼服用，必可於短期</p>
<p>內恢復美滿健全，患者如能親</p>
<p>來本診所施用電療注射等最新</p>
<p>療法，更可保證根本治愈。</p>

<h3>夫婦間怎樣節慾和縱慾之害</h3>
<p>夫婦愛情是建築在性生活的基礎上，這恐怕誰也不能否認吧！一個精力豐沛的男子討了一個健美夫人，他斷不當她是「花瓶」或偶像一樣的看待，必然熱烈地把她抱在懷裏視為心中的靈魂，生命的全部，由兩個生命的結合，就產生新的小生命，所以恩愛夫婦的生男育女，是當然的結果。不過，夫婦恩愛很容易使人誤解為縱慾；其實，愛情是須要節慾來生長的。我們知道女性的生理，在一次經期中只有一次性的高浪。雖在高浪的相近不免有幾次小的波瀾，但在經期前後斷不適宜於性行為。至於在妻子生產前後，差不多有好幾個月，丈夫須從事於節慾修養的。此時若能把其精力發揮在事業與學術之上，這不特事業與學術多得進步，對於產身心也很有裨益！關於男女生理雖無女子這樣的特徵，但在性生活中所需用的精液是萬分貴重的。一個精力充足男子一次的射精，恒有精蟲二百兆五百兆之多，以及許多營養精蟲的液體。這種物質，都是經過體內最高級最煩複的分化作用所產生的鈣和燐質，也就是我人的腦，腎以及神經的主要資料。所以凡男子於早年犯有自凟遺粗或婚後的荒淫無度把精液（即生殖腺液）耗用枯竭者，則必腎萎早洩，腦弱失眠，發育不全，未老先衰，精薄不育等症即不一而足。這是非常危險的！恩愛夫婦，他們及時行樂的機會，果然不願輕易放棄，但必相互的鼓勵着節慾，以增進健康來確保他們愛情的永恒。如果因身體素弱，或年輕無知而患有上述症象，亦必及早作根治之計，失却不了性能健康，那就要辜負了愛人，成為愛情中的罪人，他的苦惱，旁人是難以理會其萬一的！</p>
<p>上述症象，欲謀袖救，據世界名醫千萬病案及余歷年經騐、均以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最為對症特效。因此劑係由雄壯動物如猿猴，猩猩，海狗等體中提取的生殖腺素用科學方法複製而成，所以品質名貴，功效確實，為任何　丸精質製劑所不及。服後於一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，繼續服用更可助長發育，調整新陳代謝，上述症象於短期內必可根本痊愈。秋冬常服更能延年益壽返老還童。惟有遺精者須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」以固精關，制止遺洩，則治標治本並施，收效尤速！</p>
<p>患者韓一飛君，婚後患腎萎早洩甚劇，兼有遺精，上月由友介紹來治，余即採用標本並治療法，囑其在中西大藥房購服「生殖素」與「希米脫氏固精片」，為時一月頃病已完全霍然，面容紅潤，精力尤為豐足。</p>

<h3>乳峯的萎癟千萬不可忽視！</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>亂峯高：幸福無限好！　稽峯癟：命途多磨蝎！</p>
<p>基於生理上的硏究，以及事實上的證明，我們對女子的亂峯發育，乃有如下兩個很恰當的斷語。一：因為女子的亂峯發育良好，形成高聳而有彈性狀態。則其人的生殖腺卵巢機能必異常强盛，由是各部的組織亦非常健合，故臀部丯　，肌肉滑潤，身段靈活，而頰更似三春之花，在外部的輪　上看來，已極盡風流　娜之極緻，有誰見之而不怦然心動？二：各部的組織旣非常健合，於是思想，性情，智慧，判斷力，在在均高人一等。以言讀書，易於領悟。以言習藝，（包括文藝，剌繡編結，縫紉以及其他一切）亦無不易於精進。以言待人接特，則又莫不笑靨迎人，溫柔可愛。此等女性，秀外慧中，誠時代男子求之而不可得，故一旦遺嫁而後，丈夫未有不愛之如珍寶，其幸福豈有限量哉？至於乳峯萎癟的女性，那眞是悽慘極了！她一方因為身體的羸弱，遭受病魔的侵襲，弄得多病多痛，一方面因為健美的喪失，雖穿錦衣綉服，也難免不受識者所議笑，所以在處女時，便無人向她熱烈追求，常致春閨空守。出嫁後夫婦的愛情，亦必非常淡薄，甚至子女無出，而為丈夫遺棄不　！身世感覺漂零！唯一補救辦法。祇有立即服以生殖腺卵冷巢分泌製劑女用『生殖素』，方可如願以償。蓋此劑係由壯健動特的卵巢精華製成。故服後一日夜間即可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖宮止帶。若繼續服用，必能在短期內使亂峯隆然高聳，面頰紅潤，化醜陋為嬌姸，而增進其無量幸福。</p>
<h3>遺精的根本療法</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>因爲我們知道有許多江湖醫生爲人治病，徒敷衍於一時，這雖然適應了病家錯誤的心理，而飽了他的私囊，但人家的生命，就等於我的生命，病家抱了痛苦來求治，而醫生反玩弄他把他生命當兒戲，豈不罪大惡極？</p>
<p>遺精一症，雖無痛癢，但其結果却有萬分危險！世間真不知有多少青年，就葬送在遺精失治後的痛苦深淵中。青年人何以有遺精，不外爲下列諸種原因；（一）手淫放縱，（二）早婚縱慾；（三）先天衰弱病後失調；（四）用腦用力過度以及憂傷太甚等。以上原因中尤以手淫縱慾的原因最居多數。因爲此種勾當最易傷害性神經，使精關鬆弛，遺精症即繼之而起。</p>
<p>遺精一起，即應作根本治療之計，萬不可因循苟且。因遺精日久，精關機能必格外鬆弛，由此而造成滑精漏精症者實多不勝計，然而元氣也就大虧了。於是凡腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，腎萎早洩，發育不全，未老先衰等症象即相繼而來，此種男子必然形容憔悴，多痛多病，受盡苦楚，求學習業，一無成就，前途黯談！在男女之間，且將爲女性所吐棄，爲妻子所憎恨，人生幸福，喪盡無餘！</p>
<p>關於遺精的根本療法，日常生活的注意攝生，如戒絶自凟，不讀淫書淫畫，勤運動，常用冷水洗滌局部，均有裨益，但特效藥物亦屬必要。據世界名醫及余經騐，均以爲服「希米脱氏固精片」，則確有鞏固精關，鎭静神經，安眠止遺之效。如因遺精已有上述症象者，則須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，精血及神經，繼繼服用，必可於短期內恢復美滿健全，患者如能親來本診所施用電療注射等最新療法，更可保證根本治愈。</p>

<h3>電療在治淋上之新價值</h3>
<p>在近十年來，淋病療法上，確有飛躍之進展，而理學療法方面，尤有長足之進展。以理學療法中之電療而言，始則採用波長，繼而發見長波電療，在某種塲所，尚不能發揮其殺菌之特長。於是更進而研究改良而發明短波，在應用與殺菌的效率上，誠非長波所及。但在某種塲所，仍有缺點，而長波則仍有優點之存在。故長短波電療於淋病治療法上，如輪相輔，不可偏廢。但兩者之缺陷甚多，不可備舉。因此對於電器械之本身上，經一般學者不倦地精進研究，益見進歩。以現在一般醫家所用之電療而言，多失之陳舊，殊不足合吾人理想上殺菌之効力。因之一般浮猾淺識之流，一概抹殺，未免太過。因現在確已發明最合吾人理想之電療——濾淋平流電療法。</p>
<p>濾淋平流電療，是德國電療界中最新之發明。其透射與殺菌力，恰到好處。無過與不及之弊。能將急慢性淋病局部之淋菌，加以澈底之掃盪。故歐美各大花柳病院，無不有濾淋平流電療機之設備。自濾淋平流電療發明而後，電療在淋病的治療上已有新的估價，余十數年來之經騐，在電療中要以濾淋電療爲第一。如能詳察病情，而輔用對症療法，如攝護腺炎之輔用按摩，關節炎之輔用希氏血淸，自能限期根治。因濾淋電療既能殺菌而濾淸淋毒，而血淸又能撲滅血液中之淋菌也。</p>

<h3>從「法」到「文」的二「坐」</h3>
<p>— 靑侯</p>
<p>或者是因為喜歡駁雜的罷，我有時總看看所謂「文士」的專書以外的書，而尤其愛翻一翻我們一向有的法律書。那原因，倒不是想得法學博士，而是為的想研究出「立法」的用意，想硏究出某種「法」是怎樣的容易使人「玩法」。</p>
<p>實在說來，我這硏究的還是「文士」們底花樣。因為我們歷來的所謂「法家」，根本上就和文士分不開的。法家所立的「法」，骨子裏要對付的實在只是老百姓。文士所以少「犯法」，就因為「知法」，而正惟其「知法」，纔能够「玩法」，終於便成了用「法」掩飾自己底「不法」。——自然，「作法自斃」的，也並不是沒有。</p>
<p>我覺得在我們一向有的「法」裏面，最厲害的莫過於「連坐」和「反坐」。</p>
<p>「連坐」，據「史記」說是法家老祖宗商鞅發明的。後來又呌作「綠坐」，在「唐律疏義」中說得已經是平常得很。總之這是要把罪人底老子，兒子，哥哥，弟弟，一塌括子都捉去吃官司或砍頭。在一向有的「法」的明文上好像本都只把「緣坐」圈在「親族」的範圍內，而最古的「唐律」還對於「親族」有「非同居者」幾個大字的，可是事實上却往往不是這麼一回事。一「連坐」了起來，不但罪人底「非同居」的親族要被拉在一道，而且非親族也要被拉在一道，甚至要拉到絕不相干的人底身上。明朝底「瓜蔓抄」是這樣，淸朝的文字獄也用的是這種「法」。這在執行者一面，也確是痛快之至。</p>
<p>「反坐」，我可不知道是甚麼人發明的，只知道在最古的「唐律」上便已經有這條規定了。照一向的明文，自然是有這理的：要使別個人受刑事處分，而該罪不成立，自己便得變成罪人。「唐律」上所說的「諸誣吿人者皆反坐」就是。但這也只是紙上的明文，後來的事實也往往不是這麼一回事。往往原吿倒並不是「誣吿」，却會被「誣」成了「誣吿」，這時候就有「玩法」的花樣現了。而且往往某種事本是被吿所做的，被吿却能把那事照樣安在原吿底身上。——這一手，便是從前狀子上所說的「反噬」，算是最可怕的一手。</p>
<p>這說的都是「舊法」。「新法」我雖然沒有研究過，但聽說「連坐」是廢止了。「反坐」呢，大槪是有的，但據說流弊是少起來了，不過究竟怎樣，我却還不大明白。</p>
<p>但雖然有的廢止了，有的流弊少起來了，而在「文士」的社會中還可以找到這兩種「法」的餘威。這個，我也硏究出了一點。</p>
<p>譬如一位文士，鼻梁被人打中了，便悻悻地把自己底「特色」推給對方，那作風是：「你說我反動，其實你纔是反動！」—這便是反坐法的應用。又譬如一位文士，鼻梁被人打中了，便把打自己的人底周國的人們都給詛咒一通，甚至不管那些人和自己所認為的敵人有沒有關係，只一口咬定都是一樣的甚麼派。——這便是運坐法的應用。假使二「坐」並用，那就更加厲害，於是文士便自以為是得勝了。</p>
<p>文士底「文」還沒有學通，先學通了這一竅，就不說也罷，只就這兩種老法子的「法」來說，一完全應用到「文」的上面，據我看來，眞正的得勝却是難有把握的。實在要「玩法」，也不是容易的事：要反坐進化為反噬，也要造出些反噬的證據纔行。若是只學到潑婦式的「你說我偷漢，其實是你偷漢」的口吻，却總難呌人相信。儘管自己面紅耳赤，也只能呌人覺得滑稽面已。連坐法的應用更加困難：因為這時候的文士，究竟不是「法」的執行者，旣不能實際調查，只有專靠嗅的一法。然而這是要出毛病的，不是把兩個人誤認作一個人，便是把局外人誤認局內人。這難然自己認為是痛快之至，其實也只能使人覺得滑稽而已。</p>
<p>二「坐」不行，老「法」難「玩」，文士的跳踉無效，實在也是時代使然。</p>
<p>不過却也可以作另外的一種解釋。報十不是曾經載過某方正在施行着連坐法嗎？同時報上也不是吿訴我們在某方的「法」下常有人因為「誣吿」而受罰的嗎？那麼，我們底文士也可以說是迎合着「新時代」底精神的。</p>
<h3>三個鷄蛋</h3>
<p>— 林泉</p>
<p>中午，太陽升到頭頂上，熱風掃起了地面的灰塵；林木間，濃密的葉片倦怠地下　。山　像瞌睡的老年人似的蹲伏着。</p>
<p>我獨個兒在田畦上走着。兩腿很酸，頭有點昏，臂上的行軍袋更變重了。</p>
<p>前面的村落裏雄鷄正午唱。黃土小道像無盡長地向前仲展着。</p>
<p>村落就在前面了。望着村口的樹和茅屋，支持着疲倦的身軀，加勁地向前走着，口乾得要裂開來，眼睛也發花了。</p>
<p>「女兵！女兵！新四軍的！……」</p>
<p>村口的一條小河邊，孩子們停止了他們弄水的游戲，指指點點的向我呌着。</p>
<p>茅屋的門檻上一個老婆婆坐着摘蠶豆，一夥雛鷄在脚旁硺食着蠶豆　。</p>
<p>「老奶奶！摘豆子呀！」</p>
<p>我過去打着招呼。</p>
<p>「摘豆子啊！啊！「同志」辛苦了？那裏來呀？」</p>
<p>老婆婆很慈和很　朗。淸潔的鹽組布褂子是有補綻的，一　紅　花　穿在瘦小的脚上，像兩雙耀眼的紅菱解。</p>
<p>「我哥哥也在你們那里頭的！我哥哥李天福，他呌李天福！」</p>
<p>孩子們也圍上來了。一個小　　頭有點不自然但又很驕傲似地，眉毛抬得高高地對我講。其餘的孩子們瞪大了羨慕的眼睛望着他，小癩痢耳根子都紅了。</p>
<p>「他哥哥是舊年冬天到你們隊伍里去的，是他自己一定要去的！你們隊伍眞好，這一菩瞌兵！」</p>
<p>老婆婆補充着小癩痢的話，便扯着請我到屋裏去休息，屋子裏還有一位客人。</p>
<p>「你們的同志會做工作啊！道理講得眞好！××店那裏的農抗會辦了合作社，借錢也好借了，要不，這靑黃不接的時候……」</p>
<p>客人是××店農抗會的理事。那兒的工作講得很起勁。</p>
<p>「不要呌那個女同志走啊！麵下鍋了！」</p>
<p>老婆婆在灶間呌着，不知什麼時候她又走進去了。</p>
<p>「老奶奶！這怎麼行呢？我吃了來的，還要趕路呢……」</p>
<p>我推却着很感到不安。站起身來就想走，然而客人拉着了我。</p>
<p>「鄕下沒有什麼可吃的，隨便下點麵，到××店還有十里路呢！……」</p>
<p>於是我祇好懷滿了不安地坐下來。</p>
<p>麵端上來了，那是白水煮的。上面浮着幾點油腥和幾片靑菜葉了子。</p>
<p>「這眞是不好意思！眞不應該……」</p>
<p>什麼不好意思，你們自已講的老百姓的軍隊是一家呀！——舊年你們同志到我們這里來的可不少，還搭台演戲哪！不要看我老了不中用，你們同志講的話我都懂……吃吧！到外面來吃，有風，凉快點一走路　肚子那怎麼行？……」</p>
<p>老婆婆把一大碗麵送給客人，小碗的遞給我，麵冒着熱氣，滾燙的。我用筷子翻着絞着，麵條被全部挑起來，突然，我發覺了，麵條下面還藏着三個鷄蛋！我立刻敏感地猜着是怎麼回事了，於是我抬頭看着對面客人的碗，他也正把麵挑起來絞着，然而盌底是什麼也沒有。</p>
<p>「眞是熱得很，還是吹吹風吧！」</p>
<p>我不自然的說着，端着碗坐到門檻上去。外面有些風，廣闊無際的田野開展着。孩子們跳到水里去捉魚，雛鷄們還在灰堆邊啄着蠶豆殻。一雙老黃狗臥倒在榆樹的濃蔭下。一切都是柔和而寗靜。我再低頭看看碗里的三個鷄泥漿……</p>
<p>心裏，與奮和愉快動得跳起來。回過頭來，正碰着老婆婆慈詳的投射過來的誠摯的目光，一陣灼熱的感覺爬上我的面頰。我知道自己的臉一定紅了。</p>

<p>安靜，太平的歲月裏，誰無綺思與遐想呢？音管和鍵子織成的和諧境界，你不神得嗎？我更愛用幻想的彩筆描畫心靈的意象。</p>
<p>如今，則別是一番心境，頗思繪構幾幅連環圖畫：</p>
<p>晚鴉駄着夕陽，一隻兩隻的歸林去了，村莊沐浴在紅光裏恬靜，美麗。</p>
<p>鐵烏追踪而來了。盤旋又盤旋。</p>
<p>轟隆，轟降……略略略……</p>
<p>泥土翻了一個身，血肉灌溉了土地。（寃恨的種子播下了，大地之子會復仇的。）</p>
<p>夕陽也許是不忍卒暏吧，哀怨地　下去了。火熊熊地燃燒着，映紅了半　天；算是代替了它。</p>
<p>鐵烏吹着「勝利」的呼哨回去了。</p>
<p>哭號，呌喚和呻吟脹破了宇宙的腦子。月亮痛苦地露出蒼白的臉，望着苦難的大地太息。</p>
<p>活着的人却憤怒了。</p>
<p>「山裏去。」「拉出去。」洪亮的吼聲從原野返響到原野。手臂森林般的舉起來了。</p>
<p>原野沸勝了。</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>紐約博覽會中的游藝節目</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>紐約世界博覽會的會塲之中，除了陳列各種商品藝術術品之外，關於娛樂方面，種種的游藝，也應有盡有。這裹來舉出一些特別的節目：</p>
<p>（一）綫電影　無綫電影在美國，今年是一個實現的年頭，在紐的的世界博覽會中，不單是另闢播映無綫電影室，同時更把會塲上的各種景象，收取無綫電影，播放到世界各國。所以關於博覽會塲的情狀，歐洲各國，也能在無綫電影中看得到的。</p>
<p>（二）電力傀儡　美國有一位傀儡戲的專家，呌歐納華爾夫，他的傀儡戲不用手牽而用電力牽綫的，也是一種新的發明。最近他全副的電力傀儡戲班，也在紐的博覽會塲上公開表演，所演更都是著名的世界偉大歌劇，一般的人們也表示相當歡迎。</p>
<p>（三）裸體表演　裸體表演在紐的世界博覽會中，是很使人刺激的一種娛樂。事前對於這種表演，有人劇烈的表示反對過，但結果還是公開的表演了。而且有幾幕是全裸的。擔任表演的更全是健美的姑娘，除了普通的節目外，更有一幕裸體游泳表演，非常精彩。</p>
<p>（四）美女展覽　紐的博覽會的會塲之中，建有一所天堂樂園，為了需要若干美女作為點綴，特於事前到美國的西部去物色，而好萊塢的美女明星，獲選的有十一人之多。這些女人，都在天堂樂園中供人觀賞，好像是美女的展覽。</p>
<p>（五）鉅片首映　最近在大光明公映的鉅片「新金山」，不久之前，就在紐的世界博覽會塲作全世界的首决獻映，禮節是相當隆重。第一個晚上，祇准官塲方面和各國的外交官去參觀，為了故事描寫澳洲的風光，澳國駐紐的領事那天晚上，也親往參觀。自第二晚起，是公映了，任何人可去鑒賞，從此一連幾天都吿客滿。</p>
<p>（六）其他　除了上面所說的種種而外，凡是戲劇，歌劇，音樂，以及馬戲，雜耍等，在美國風行的游藝，這一决紐的世界博覽會，差不多是什麼都收羅着。所以一個遊客，要看完這些游藝，至少耍費幾星期的時間呢！</p>
<h3>抗戰史實片　「血濺寳山城」在渝獻映</h3>
<p>— 慧存</p>
<p>—獲輿論一致好評</p>
<p>名導演司徒慧敏自離滬至港後，即與蔡楚生合作攝製了一部「血濺寳山城」，該片故事叙述九十八師營長姚子靑，率領六百多弟兄死守寳山城，直到失陷為止，全營六百多弟兄，除了一個出城乞援外，餘均全部殉難。劇情悲壯激烈，可泣可歌，該片與「中電」遷渝後之前部出品「孤城喋血」，同樣取材，有異曲同工之妙。惟劇情方面，支配稍有不同。該片為硬派小生李淸與陳雲裳等主演，於去年攝製完成，當即在港放映，頗得觀衆贊美，各報好評。</p>
<p>現在，該片巳轉道運抵重慶，在唯一影院獻映。連日來賣座頗盛，觀衆擁掛，院方難以應付，除展長映期外，別無他法，故該片目前仍在放映中。（按：重慶影院較為設備完美者共有「國泰」「新川」「唯一」等數家，自經日機襲渝，「國泰一被焚，「新川」被炸，現在碩果僅存的，祇有「唯一」一家，（眞是唯一）該院面積並不甚大，且有一部份已闢作難民收容所，故範圍更見其小，而該院上决放映「保家鄕」時，觀衆擁擠非凡，此决開映國防佳片「血濺寳山城」，賣座之盛，當亦不能例外。</p>
<h3>北平劇訊　更新舞台邀聘名角</h3>
<p>— 燕雁</p>
<p>第一批改為吳素秋　苟慧生將接其後局</p>
<p>上海更新舞台派鄭子褒社菊初一人來平邀角，頗形活躍，經多方接洽，現巳得有頭緒。除第一日已約妥吳素秋，趙嘯瀾，李視秀三坤伶前往剪彩，舉行開幕禮外；其全班人選，亦已的定，鬚生為陳少霖，武生為梁慧超（現在天津大舞台，與呂慧君同班演唱），旦角為魏蓮芳，裏子老生張春彥，老旦李多奎，丑角孫盛武，花臉未定，其中以小生人選最為名貴，乃名家兪振飛也。</p>
<p>上述全班人馬之行期，定於本月二十八日，最遲當不出月底，惟趙嘯瀾之行期或將提前。至於更新之開慕日期，的在九月十日，第一日將由吳趙李三人合演佳劇，戲目未定，但非龍鳳呈祥，即四五花洞，以後即由吳素秋單獨演唱，據云滬人對吳之期望甚深也。</p>
<p>荀慧生已確為更新邀妥，惟日期或將展緩。荀已久不赴滬演唱，實因暈船之故。此决鄭子褒杜菊初北來，持有張嘯林之親筆函，張與荀氏誼屬師生，故荀不能不去。苟之行期當在下月中旬。</p>
<p>接吳荀之後，李萬春，譚富英等均將絡繹前來，惟近來黃金更新均有人來邀角，與各名伶接洽頻繁，故消息紛岐，最後之決定，此時尙難概括論之。惟上記之消息，則均可靠，故為詳述如上，當為滬人所樂聞也。</p>
<p>藝人漫記</p>
<h3>「陳查禮自白」（上）</h3>
<p>— 徐莘園</p>
<p>—拍演偵探片的感想</p>
<p>編者介紹：徐莘園君，銀壇宿將，負名已久；因為生就魁梧過人的身村，又兼極富演劇經騐，扮飾軍閥，官僚，以及大腹賈之類的角色，更屬維妙維肖，最見得神。論銀幕老生型人才，自尙冠武往歲作古以後，羣推首屈一指，當之無愧，良非虛譽。近演偵探片「中國陳禮查」一角，為國片作派闢一新的路錢，尤多優良成就；本文專論及此，於偵探劇多所發揮，極堪重視。</p>
<p>偵探對誰做，這句話我當當聽人家說，但是自己沒有經騐過，以為不是一樣的做戲，一樣的表情，有何難處？豈知這决加入新華公司，拍攝「陳查禮返國」第一探案「珍珠衫』的時候，已感覺到的確是不容易，我們做演員的，無論扮飾一種甚麼角色，或是官僚政客，或是巨紳富商，與土豪惡霸，總有一個模範標凖，紙要抓住劇中人的個性，當然是扮誰像誰，至少也有若干把握的。惟有扮飾偵探角色，事實上中國社會，就缺乏這種人物，簡直無從摹仿。允其是扮飾「陳查禮，」更覺困難。美國扮陳查禮的華納夏能，雖然有很多片子在中國演過，可是他的劇情與動作，是完全歐化，而和我們的習俗大都不同的。比如戲中有許多新發明的科學醫學種種機械，在中國不獨不常見，就是有的話，拍戲限於資本關係，也很難辦到。至於講到華納夏能的表情遲緩，毫無精神，陳查醴亦不該是具此典型的，那全是外國人扮飾中國人故意形容過火，所以我在「珍珠衫」戲中的動作，並不完全摹仿華納夏能，而徐欣夫導演也關照不要太沒有精神，要取他之長，去他人之短，到後來片子拍成功，公映的時候，觀衆的枇評，有的說面貌很像，表情動作太慢了，有的說舉動延緩，很像陳查禮的姿態，這叫我進退維谷，莫知所從，可眞難煞了做演員的了。</p>
<h3>銀壇情報</h3>

<h3>Cantonese Guerrilla Units Discuss Coordination; Chinese Army Plans General Counter-Offensive Against Japan; Japanese Troops in Qianjiang Suffer Heavy Losses in Numerous Raids; Fierce Fighting in Lishi, Shanxi Province; Japanese Troops Prepare to Retreat Northward</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, the Han River has receded slightly.

Although Japanese troops in Zhongxiang have recently received reinforcements, the Chinese army controls the high ground north of Zhongxiang, giving them a superior position. Japanese troops in the Qianjiang area have suffered heavy losses due to numerous Chinese army raids. Both armies are currently engaged in fierce fighting on the outskirts of Qianjiang. The Chinese army in the Guangdong area is planning a general counter-offensive against the Japanese army. Military leaders in the Dongjiang and Xijiang areas are currently discussing a counter-offensive plan with guerrilla units providing support. In Lishi, Shanxi Province, the fighting is extremely fierce. The Japanese army has suffered heavy losses and appears to be preparing to retreat northward. (Fourteenth United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) General Zhang Zhizhong, the Chinese army's commander in Shanghai in 1937, gave a speech at a luncheon held at the August 13th Club yesterday. He predicted that the Chinese army would launch a general counter-offensive in the near future. General Zhang divided the Sino-Japanese War into three stages. The first stage, including the period of the Japanese army's advance along the Great Wall, was a time when the Chinese army took a defensive posture. The second stage began with the Battle of Shanghai and was a time when the Japanese army penetrated deep into the Chinese interior. The third stage has now begun, which is the time for the Chinese army to launch a counter-offensive to annihilate the Japanese army in China. (Fourteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>President Chiang's Message to the People of Shanghai; Cultural Circles Build Spiritual Bastion; Financial Circles Strengthen Confidence in Legal Tender; Government Has Prepared Comprehensive Measures to Put Wartime Economy on the Right Track</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Today marks the second anniversary of the start of the Battle of Shanghai. President Chiang Kai-shek issued a message to the people of Shanghai, beginning with the words, "None of our soldiers and civilians at the front and in the rear today are not thinking of Shanghai, none are not missing our compatriots who remain in Shanghai. I would especially like to express my thoughts and expectations to our compatriots who remain in Shanghai." President Chiang then made the following appeals to the people of Shanghai: (1) The cultural and public opinion circles should establish a strong spiritual "bastion" to resist Japanese propaganda. (2) The economic and financial circles should unite to strengthen confidence, trust legal tender, and stabilize finance. (3) The youth of Shanghai must understand their responsibilities, be diligent and self-improving, and engage in the study of various academic and technical skills related to resistance and reconstruction. (4) The workers of Shanghai should unite as one, love and respect themselves, support resistance and reconstruction, and carry it through to the end. (5) People from all walks of life in Shanghai should help each other, share weal and woe. If the people of Shanghai can endure the current difficult period, they will surely enhance the glory of the nation and the national character. The message detailed Shanghai's past achievements in China's reform and revolution, especially the tragic and heroic sacrifices made in the Battle of Shanghai. President Chiang said in this regard, "The loyal and courageous acts of the people of Shanghai in resisting the war have written countless tragic histories worthy of song and tears, causing the Japanese to realize that their delusion of forcing China to submit within a few weeks was a fantasy, and suddenly changed international perceptions, knowing that the Chinese nation is absolutely not a nation that can be subjugated, and knowing that China's resistance war will definitely have a bright future... Although this was two years ago, it is still clearly remembered in the minds of our compatriots throughout the country today." President Chiang continued that since the fall of Shanghai, many factories and cultural groups in Shanghai, as well as many skilled technical experts and technicians, have moved to the interior, making important contributions to the resistance movement. Now that the War of Resistance has entered its third year, the situation of the people of Shanghai has become more complex and more difficult, but the situation of the War of Resistance is improving daily and approaching final victory. Therefore, the Japanese are intensifying their political and economic oppression of the Chinese in Shanghai, and the responsibility of the Chinese in Shanghai for the country's war has also increased. President Chiang earnestly said, "Now there are only two paths before us: one is to surrender and perish, sinking into eternal slavery, and the other is to struggle hard, persevere, seek victory, and revive China. This is the only path that patriotic and courageous people should take." President Chiang also discussed the currency situation in Shanghai, saying that fluctuations in the foreign exchange market cannot affect the price of the legal tender itself. China's basic needs of food, clothing, housing, and transportation can be largely self-sufficient. China has endless treasures and resources, so the legal tender has endless reserves and credit. Once the people recognize that the War of Resistance has the certainty of final victory and the country has a bright future, then their belief in the legal tender will naturally not be fundamentally shaken. President Chiang finally comforted the people of Shanghai, saying that the government has now prepared comprehensive measures to put the wartime economy on the right track. The people must understand that supporting the legal tender is a manifestation of loving the country. He hoped that people in Shanghai's economic circles would hold fast to their economic "bastion" and strengthen their trust in and love for the legal tender, which would be the greatest responsibility they could fulfill to the country and the War of Resistance.

It is believed here that this clear declaration is very meaningful, because in the early days of the revolution, General Zhang and Wang had a very close relationship, and Wang often relied on Zhang's assistance in military matters.

<h3>Anti-British Movement in Tianjin Worsens; Concessions Take Extraordinary Precautions</h3>
<p>Armored vehicles patrol; volunteer corps fully mobilized; two demonstrations quickly dispersed; Japanese military spokesman declares blockade policy unchanged; British side responsible if situation in concessions deteriorates</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Japanese military spokesman issued a statement today, stating in part, "The blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin is essential for the self-defense of the Japanese army in North China, and it is also essential for maintaining peace and order in North China. Therefore, unless the British Concession in Tianjin fundamentally changes its attitude, the blockade is absolutely necessary. Furthermore, if the situation in the British Concession in Tianjin deteriorates, the British side must bear full responsibility." (Fourteenth Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) To prevent any actions by the anti-British rally being held here, the British Concession Volunteer Corps was fully mobilized this morning and patrolled around the British Concession. Two anti-British rallies were held today. They were prepared to gather at 10:00 a.m. to hold a joint anti-British march. Several resolutions were passed at the anti-British rally yesterday, with the aim of "driving British forces out of the Far East" and to have all people in Japanese-occupied areas participate in the anti-British movement, and to organize anti-British societies to attack British and pro-British Chinese. The anti-British rally also sent a telegram to the Japanese government, supporting the Japanese military official's return to the matter of the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo, and sent reports to the "Provisional Government" in Beiping and the "puppet" Manchukuo government, saying that in these two days, the anti-British movement had attracted national attention, like "a wildfire," and saying, "Our purpose is to drive British forces out of the Far East. The past actions of the British have caused China to fall into colonial status. Our present work will lay a foundation for a new order in the Far East." (Fourteenth Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After the anti-British "mass rally" here, it split into two demonstrations. One was held in the former German Concession, but it quickly dispersed because its constituents had no real enthusiasm for anti-British sentiment. The other demonstration was held in the Chinese area, with several hundred participants, but thousands of onlookers. These demonstrators were led by a number of trucks, holding anti-British flags, and stopped in the Japanese Concession without proceeding further, then disbanded. The British side here is anticipating further crazy demonstrations tomorrow or later, so will continue to take precautionary measures. (Fourteenth Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Yantai The anti-British movement here is now expanding daily. Last Friday, a small group of Japanese broke into the British Consulate, throwing bricks and stones, breaking eighteen of the consulate's windows.

<h3>Germany and Italy's Political Talks and the European Situation</h3>
<p>While Britain is hesitant and Japan is indecisive, with Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo stalled, Germany and Italy are again discussing new actions in Europe. The location is Salzburg, not far from Munich. The participants are Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on the German side and Foreign Minister Ciano on the Italian side, with German leader Hitler also personally involved twice. The talks began on the 11th of this month and lasted for three days, "discussing current political issues in an extremely friendly spirit." Since the establishment of the German-Italian military alliance, this is the most important talk between the two countries. This talk demonstrates that the aggressive bloc is indeed struggling non-stop, demonstrating against the anti-aggression front whose development is not yet sound. It also hints at the impending arrival of a new European crisis. On the other hand, according to a report in the London "Financial Times," "Mussolini will propose convening an international conference in the near future to improve relations between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy." According to the French Figaro newspaper, "Warsaw is rumored to have heard that Ciano proposed to Ribbentrop a compromise solution to the Danzig dispute." Although these two statements have not been confirmed, this atmosphere alone may be enough to move Chamberlain, who is obsessed with promoting a policy of appeasement and concluding a four-power pact. Coercion and inducement go hand in hand, this is an effective old remedy, a magical treatment that can work without surgery, but the symptoms are different from the past, this time it may be ineffective!</p>
<p>The results of this talk, apart from issuing a hollow communique, are not announced as usual. According to foreign reports, the main issues discussed by the two sides were three: (1) the Danzig issue; (2) countries that have expressed sympathy for the German-Italian axis, especially Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria, should be centered on the German-Italian axis and organized politically to resist the "encirclement policy" issue; (3) the issue of Japan joining the German-Italian military alliance. Although these three items are not confirmed by the communique, they are the implied meaning of the topic. Moreover, Germany, because of the deep internal contradictions, can only take continuous external risks. Since seizing Memel, to conclude the so-called spring movement. Summer sings civil dramas as much as possible, sweats a little, but has no harvest; and now, it should be the season for autumn wind and nomadic horses again. Let's see how it whips and gallops!</p>
<p>Danzig? This is the plump fruit that Hitler is determined to get; according to them, getting it or not is a matter of German honor, but the problem is that Poland is determined to resist aggression, and Poland has also concluded a mutual assistance pact with Britain. If force is used, it is not enough to receive it with only honor guards, and blood will inevitably be shed before knowing success or failure. For months, Germany has painstakingly tried various ways and methods to seize it. In this Salzburg talk, Berlin's aim is clearly to obtain Rome's support, and Italy has followed suit more than once. In recent days, Roman newspapers have greatly advocated the reasons for Danzig's return to Germany, but they have also spread the rumor that "Mussolini is trying to ease the policy pursued by the German leader and advise him not to realize his territorial demands by means of causing war." This is exactly the same as the situation in September last year, when Roman newspapers advocated the return of the Sudetenland to Germany, and Mussolini "advised" Hitler to be cautious and careful.</p>
<p>According to news from France: "The actions taken by Germany towards the Free City of Danzig are only a smoke screen, in fact, a major incident is brewing in Southeastern Europe." This is not without basis. In this Salzburg talk, Germany and Italy colluded to tighten their control over Hungary and Yugoslavia, which is clearly a central issue. Originally, South Hungary and South Korea were being drawn into the axis day by day due to geographical and historical relations; but on the other hand, any independent country is certainly unwilling to be a vassal, and still wants to get closer to Britain and France and try to get rid of the control of the axis as much as possible. The Hungarian Regent Horthy's crackdown on the Nazi Party in the country, and the South Korean Prince Paul's visit to London, are clear evidence of this. All this is what Hitler must "offset". To be honest, if Hitler wants to control Europe, the strategic position of Yugoslavia and Hungary is more important than Danzig, because they are the bridge to the Balkans. Italian Fascists have made it clear: "The European situation has lost its equilibrium, and the issue of the Danube and the Balkan Peninsula urgently needs to be clarified!" Therefore, since this Italian-German talk, the crisis in the Balkans is also becoming increasingly urgent.</p>
<p>As for the issue of Japan joining the German-Italian military alliance, Japan has recently taken the initiative, while Germany and Italy have expressed indifference. This newspaper has repeatedly discussed this, and the meaning is still not exhausted, so allow me to comment on it separately. Today, I will only talk about the European situation, which can be summarized in one sentence: Under the united conspiracy of fascist aggressors, a new crisis is brewing in Europe. In Salzburg, we have already seen the dark shadows of the crisis.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Japanese Tokyo Negotiations Fall into an Ambiguous State. Japanese Military Representative Muto Flies Back to Tianjin, Uttering Threats and Enticements Before Departure.</h3>
<p>(London) It is rumored that the Japanese government has notified Britain that if the issues of legal tender in North China and silver reserves in Tianjin are not resolved, Japan will refuse to continue negotiations with Britain. This statement was denied by government officials, who stated that the government has telegraphed new instructions to Sir Robert Craigie, the British ambassador to Japan, agreeing to hand over the four Chinese suspects in Tianjin and providing instructions on police administrative matters in the British concession. When the representatives of Britain and Japan meet next time, they can continue to discuss police power issues according to the content of the instructions. As for the statements issued by the Japanese spokesperson, if they are not included in official communiqués, they cannot be considered to have legally binding force. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry spokesman announced this morning while receiving reporters that whether Anglo-Japanese negotiations will resume depends entirely on the attitude of the United Kingdom. Before the resumption of the meeting, the Japanese side will study what attitude the United Kingdom holds towards the various pending issues. The Tianjin economic issue is of great importance to maintaining peace and order. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador Craigie visited Minister Kato this afternoon, stating that the reply from his government would arrive within a day or two, and that the reply contained a comprehensive view of the British government on security and economic issues. He expressed that he would exert his full sincerity in this Anglo-Japanese meeting to seek a comprehensive compromise, and hoped that the Japanese side would understand this point and cooperate with the British side so that the meeting could continue. Minister Kato replied that he understood the points mentioned and would consult with relevant parties before proceeding with the meeting according to the ambassador's notification. The two representatives then held various discussions on how to proceed with future meetings. As a result, it was decided that, given the nature of the economic issue, a roundtable meeting format would be avoided, and only Kato and Craigie would conduct discussions. When a decision was reached, a roundtable meeting would be convened, and local Japanese military representatives would be invited to participate in Tokyo again. Thus, the Anglo-Japanese conference, which had been suspended since the sixth roundtable meeting on July 31, could resume in two or three days, presenting a glimmer of hope. (Same dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>( ) The Japanese military delegation, led by Yamatsu, which came here to participate in the Anglo-Japanese conference, departed for Tianjin this morning. The conference has, in effect, collapsed. It is reported that upon arrival in Tianjin, the Japanese delegation will submit a detailed report to General Sugiyama, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in North China. According to the Asahi Shimbun, they will participate in important discussions to decide on the North China Japanese Army's plan to blockade the British concession. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Major General Muto, the Japanese military representative stationed in Tianjin, returned to Tianjin by plane this morning. In his departure statement, he said that since the Japanese representative stationed in Tianjin arrived in Tokyo on July 7 to attend the Anglo-Japanese talks and worked hard to resolve the Tianjin issue, but because the British side lacked sincerity, "we cannot remain in Tokyo indefinitely and have decided to return to our post. The Tianjin concession has become a source of chaos in North China's security in political, military, and economic terms. Despite repeated warnings from the Japanese side, the British concession authorities have shown no sign of repentance. The North China Japanese Army authorities, in view of the increasing harm and the urgency of the situation, have blockaded the British concession with its troops in order to eliminate the scourge. This is the first part of the Japanese military's actions, and its purpose is absolute. Therefore, if Britain has the will to lift the blockade of the concession, it should make the concession a harmless area in terms of security, which is a prerequisite. This demand made by the Japanese army to the British concession is fair and reasonable, and not harsh. The purpose of the Japanese army is simple, and its position is straightforward, but the British side is practicing a double-dealing diplomacy, attempting to drag in a third country to delay the meeting. We are well aware that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and other representatives have knowledge of the Far East and have always been resolving the problem with enthusiasm, but the British government still overestimates the erroneous reports of Kerr and other agencies stationed in China and bases its distorted knowledge of the Far East on them, which is truly regrettable. We have the 'classroom' of the British side hoping to attend the Tokyo conference, instructing on a method to fully resolve the Tianjin case, and the proper direction for Britain to implement its Far East policy, but the British side does not understand our good intentions and instead wants to use this 'classroom' to implement its traditional Far East policy. British Prime Minister Chamberlain spoke of the damage to his interests in China, calling it an 'intolerable insult.' We have been fighting China because of British aid to Chiang Kai-shek, and do not know how many lives have been sacrificed. What words can be used to console their spirits? We hope that when Britain defends its interests, it will first recognize the current situation in the Far East, and before protesting against the anti-British movement, it should reflect on its own past and present behavior. If Britain can humbly embrace our advice, Anglo-Japanese relations can be adjusted immediately, let alone this Anglo-Japanese conference. Otherwise, if Britain continues to pursue its past dreams and ignores the current reality, the consequences should be resolved by Britain itself. The day we land at this airport again by plane will be the day Britain changes its attitude." (Domei dispatch, 14th)</p>

"The position of the Pacific is becoming increasingly important, so Australia must have a separate diplomatic relationship with other Pacific countries in addition to its close relationship with Britain. Australia will act according to the will of Britain in European affairs, but the situation in the Pacific is completely different from that in Europe. What Britain's headquarters calls the 'Far East' is seen by us as the 'Near North.' I do not mean that the autonomous territories must separate from the mother country and become independent, but Australia's position in the Pacific is special, and it has its own need for independent action, but it is still a part of the British Empire and must still have close contact and cooperation with Britain, the South African Union, New Zealand, and Canada. However, Australia and New Zealand must have their own opportunities for independent action due to their special positions in the Pacific. The decision to establish embassies in Washington and Tokyo is a preliminary step for the union of Pacific countries. We will have closer diplomatic relations with the United States, China, and Japan." "Although Australia does not have a large population, its culture, minerals, and industry are all sufficient to make it a major country in the Pacific." (Associated Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Emerging World Forces Revive Moral Rearmament Movement Hold International Congress in San Francisco Promote Transforming Lives and Transforming the World</h3>
<p>(San Francisco Air Mail, August 2nd) The Christian Oxford Group was initiated a few years ago by Christians with reformist ideas in various European and American countries. Its first gathering was held at Oxford University in England, so it was named the "Oxford Group." The code of conduct it advocates has four points: absolute honesty, absolute purity, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love. It aims to take on the responsibility of reforming lives based on the spirit of Christ. This movement has now spread to countries all over the world. In the autumn of last year, when the situation in Europe was tense and the war crisis was imminent, the Oxford Group launched a moral rearmament movement and held the first international congress in Caux, Switzerland, to boost morale and save the world through spiritual power. Former British Prime Minister Baldwin, members of parliament from various parties in the British House of Lords and House of Commons, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his wife of China, and US President Roosevelt all telegraphed their support. The US Senate also listed it in congressional documents. The moral rearmament movement has become a new opportunity for the modern life of various nations. On the first of this month, the Oxford Group held the second Moral Rearmament Congress at the World's Fair in San Francisco, USA. More than 1,000 male and female representatives from 25 countries attended. Dr. Buchman, the chairman, gave the opening speech, saying, "The time is urgent. The moral rearmament movement now wants to transform lives, transform nations, create new ideas, and new personalities in a timely manner. This movement does not want to establish a new church, but wants to transcend the narrow-mindedness of various churches, parties, and individuals, and make a determination to reform." Representatives from various countries spoke one after another. The Chinese delegation also gave a speech saying, "More than two thousand years ago, the great Chinese sage Confucius pointed out a revolutionary direction, saying, 'When things are investigated, knowledge is extended; when knowledge is extended, the will becomes sincere; when the will is sincere, the heart is rectified; when the heart is rectified, the person is cultivated; when the person is cultivated, the family is regulated; when the family is regulated, the state is governed; when the state is governed the world is at peach' We are now charged with the mission of putting into practice and promoting the truths enlightened by the sages, so as to reform lives, reform nations, and reform the world. This is also the mission undertaken by the moral rearmament movement. The Chinese delegation has come from across the Pacific to participate in this grand event, deeply believing that the unity of our nation, the transformation of society, the relief of refugees, and the displacement of tens of millions of people, all these problems can find their answers in this moral rearmament movement. We are here to follow in the footsteps of the advanced countries of Europe and the United States and train to become members of the vanguard of the world's reform. What we have seen and heard during our month in America is deeply moving. Now that we are packing our bags to return home, we vow to do our best to promote the spiritual revival of the Chinese nation as the foundation for our country's rejuvenation. Moreover, our country and our leaders are deeply loved by us. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his wife recently sent a telegram from Chongqing, and we dare to read it to the attendees to express the enthusiasm of our country's highest authorities in supporting the moral rearmament movement. The telegram reads, 'We hear from afar your call to move lives and enthusiastically respond, deeply believing that this moral rearmament movement will surely reveal the innate conscience and ability of all nations and all thoughtful individuals.'"

<h3>German-Italian Talks Conclude, European Situation Becomes More Tense. Both Sides Reach a Compromise on General Issues. Germany Considers the Danzig Issue a Matter of Honor.</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to an official authorized message distributed to foreign newspapers regarding the talks between the Axis countries in Salzburg and Berchtesgaden, it states that Danzig is the most intense issue in the world today. The message reiterates the policies of Germany and Italy, stating that the two countries have now reached a complete compromise, and that the joint agreement of civil governments has made Poland's attitude increasingly tough. Therefore, Germany's glory and the treatment of the German people have been seriously affected. Unofficial sources with good information said that the talks between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, German leader Hitler, and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop have caused great unease. The Italian Foreign Minister has already flown back to Rome. Newspapers here are all explaining that the current tense situation does not show any signs of easing, and there is a tendency in the opposite direction. No one knows what was discussed in Berchtesgaden, and many pessimistic rumors have arisen. The most startling of these is that Hitler will deliver a speech to the nation on Tuesday, and German troops will set off that evening. What is noteworthy now is that what the German and Italian newspapers are talking about is the revision of the entire situation, not the solution of individual issues. Some people believe that the German-Italian talks lasted far longer than originally expected, which shows that the Axis countries did not fully agree with everything that is now said to have been agreed upon at the beginning. However, there are also less pessimistic rumors, such as the claim that Italy's opinion has largely taken hold. After the talks ended yesterday, a German Foreign Ministry spokesman told a Reuters reporter that as a result of the talks, Germany and Italy have completely compromised on all issues in the past, present, and future. The spokesman acknowledged that the Danzig issue had been discussed, but the date for its resolution had not yet been determined. Other European issues were also discussed at that time. No communiqué will be issued regarding this conversation, nor is there any plan to continue the meeting in the near future. The spokesman also said that all issues, large and small, were discussed in the talks and must and can be resolved. Complete agreement has been reached on the point of joint German-Italian action. The talks were not discussed with Britain, France, and other civil governments, because the Axis countries have determined that they can only effectively resolve the issues of justice and honor between themselves and their friends. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Only Novel Point in Semi-Official Message</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The semi-official message issued regarding the German-Italian talks was recently commented on by experienced observers, saying that it was already known that the Axis countries were determined to realize their demands, and therefore the only novel point in this message was that Germany regards the Danzig issue as a matter of honor. As to when and how Germany and Italy will move from words to actions, and whether Germany will take swift action on the Danzig issue, or whether it will suddenly raise other issues in other parts of Europe, such as the southeastern corner, all of these are still unknown. However, according to political figures, German and Italian military preparations can be completed within the next week, and the source of supplies to those countries is becoming increasingly difficult, and they also feel that the armaments of the civil governments are exceeding those of the Axis countries, and the time for them to do so is not far off. It can be said with certainty that they will take action early, although it is difficult to predict what kind of action it will be, but it will become clear in a short period of time. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Compromise Reached on Diplomatic Policies of Two Countries</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano has been holding talks with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Salzburg for several days, and has repeatedly met with leader Hitler in Berchtesgaden. No official communiqué has been issued afterwards. Recently, a statement has been issued from semi-official circles here, which is sufficient to represent the views of responsible persons. It says that "during the talks, current political issues were discussed in an extremely friendly spirit, and a compromise was reached on the entire diplomatic policy of the two countries. It is universally believed that the issues can be resolved, and it is also necessary to resolve them. Among them, the issue of the Free City of Danzig occupies an important position in the world situation and was of course submitted for discussion. Regarding this matter, Poland's attitude is becoming increasingly tough because of the support of the civil governments, which is not only related to Germany's honor, but also makes it impossible to sit idly by and watch the Germans in Poland being abused. In short, the current policies of the German and Italian governments are completely consistent, and all issues have been submitted for discussion without omission, so there is no need to continue the talks in the near future, and what is said by foreign parties is a misunderstanding of the truth." (According to outside reports, there is a possibility of a meeting between Hitler and Mussolini.) The friendship between the German and Italian nations is unbreakable, and they will jointly defend their interests. All of this has been clearly demonstrated in this conversation. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Political figures here have expressed satisfaction with the outcome of Foreign Minister Ciano's talks with German leader Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and said that the complete agreement between the foreign policies of the two Axis countries, Germany and Italy, has been clarified by the semi-official German message. The various rumors have been debunked. It is noteworthy that the message states that the current various issues, including the issue of the Free City of Danzig, can be resolved. The message also says that Germany and Italy do not need to continue talking at this time, and that Germany and Italy are moving hand in hand towards their ideal of justice.

<h3>German Navy Commander-in-Chief Criticizes Britain and Praises German Military Strength</h3>
<p>Trier, Germany Navy Commander-in-Chief Raeder delivered a speech at the Naval Association here, strongly stating that Germany is powerful and unafraid of war, saying, "Germany is now facing the threat of encirclement, the same as in 1914. The intention of the encirclementists is to force Germany to accept a treaty even more severe than the Treaty of Versailles, so that the name of Germany will no longer be on the world map. The culprit is still Britain. In fact, this is Britain's delusion and will surely fail. Leader Hitler has given the German nation strong armaments, not only with sharp weapons, but also with those who use them are precisely trained, supplemented by a strong spirit, and will surely overcome the enemy. In addition, the policy pursued by Leader Hitler is ingenious, and our country has thus obtained strong and reliable allies and friends. If the enemy countries destroy peace, they will either send troops to help or maintain benevolent neutrality. For this reason, our nation fully trusts its own strength and Leader Hitler, and looks forward to the future with peace of mind. Even if war comes, we are not afraid." (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Labor Disputes Increasing in Japan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Labor unrest this year has greatly increased compared to previous years. This can be evidenced by the number of strikes. Although the authorities have invoked the National Mobilization Law to severely control labor, strikes still occur from time to time and are likely to continue to occur in the future. There are two main factors: (1) The Sino-Japanese War has caused a large expansion of Japanese industry, and large companies have participated in large numbers, and their power is increasing. (2) Small businesses and medium-sized trading companies have been increasingly unable to find capital and have been excluded and lost their jobs. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Germany Denies Italy Put Forward Peace Plan</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German government sources last night said that the meetings held in Salzburg and Berchtesgaden, Germany, last week included issues on the Far East, colonial issues, and the European situation. According to reports, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Prime Minister Hitler and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, when the conference, the Italian agreed to aid the German policy on the Danzig. However, the Nazi Party has indicated that Germany has not announced the right of Germany, this summer, to acquire Danzig into Greater Germany. The German side of government does not recognize that Minister Ciano submitted an ambitious European Peace plan to Prime Minister Hitler. The German semi-official news agency Deutsche Telekom reported that Germany and Italy were for the summit in Salzburg and Bertschesgaden on various issues regarding the the diplomatic policy of the Berlin-Rome axis. The news agency announced, "The Danzig issue occupies an important position in the conference, which is the most important of all issues. On a variety of issues, both parties are in 100 percent agreement." The new agency said that minister Ciano and minister Ribbentrop will conduct follow-up discussion soon regarding the policies of the two countries and were exhausted. Minister Ciano yesterday had a final conference with Prime Minister Hitler, for three quarters of an hour. He left Bertschesgaden to Salzburg and with the German foreign minister Ribbentrop had lunch. Following lunch, together they went to the airport where Ciano immediately embarked on an airplane to Rome. (Associated Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Compromise Method for Resolving Danzig Dispute</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to Le Figaro, it is rumored in Warsaw that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano proposed the following compromise method to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop for resolving the Danzig dispute: (1) Abolish the position of the League of Nations Commissioner stationed in Danzig. (2) Abolish the Polish General Affairs Office stationed in the Free City and replace it with a diplomatic commission to protect Polish interests. (3) Revise the charter of Danzig as a Free City, with all administrative personnel being German. (4) Gradually clear the customs borders between Danzig and Germany over a period of five years. (5) Germany, with international public guarantee, demilitarizes Danzig, at which time Poland also removes its armory on the Westerplatte Peninsula. (6) The port is managed by an independent port authority, which includes representatives from Poland, Danzig, and Germany. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Italian Foreign Minister Ciano Flies Back to Rome</h3>
<p>(Rome) Foreign Minister Ciano flew back here from Salzburg, Austria, this evening and immediately reported to Prime Minister Mussolini on the results of his talks with leader Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. In addition, German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen also returned on the same plane as the Foreign Minister. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Göring's Newspaper Discusses Partitioning Poland</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Essener National Zeitung, the official newspaper of Air Minister General Göring, recently published an article on Polish history with very strong language. It roughly stated, "The Poland of 1939 is no different from the Poland of 1782. Frankly speaking, it only serves to disgrace civilization and endanger European peace, bringing misfortune to the residents of Europe. Back in 1782, the partitioning of Poland by its neighboring countries (namely Prussia, Austria, and Russia) was indeed a wise measure, and it was politically necessary. Truly, Poland is a semi-Asian country, prone to betrayal, so for the sake of safeguarding Central European civilization, it was necessary to partition it." Now, the rights of the Polish people and various ethnic minorities within Poland are being deprived by military dictators. They may regret not having recalled the rule of Prussia, Austria, and Russia in the past. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<h3>Tianjin Four Chinese Extradition Issue: Ambassador Guo Negotiates with Britain; Britain Repeatedly Makes Concessions to Japan; Newspapers Sharply Criticize</h3>
<p>(London) According to sources here, the Chinese government has protested to British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr regarding Britain's decision to extradite the four suspects from Tianjin. It is also rumored that the Chinese government has telegraphed Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi, urging him to do his utmost to reverse this matter. It is heard that Mr. Guo is scheduled to visit Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cadogan today. Reuters has learned that Mr. Guo will emphasize the intense emotions of China and the entire Chinese population regarding this matter. The British government's decision regarding the four suspects has again made people in the Far East fear that Britain may eventually hand over the Chinese silver currently held in various banks in the British Concession in Tianjin to the Japanese. Although key opposition members in the House of Commons are not in London at the moment, influential figures from all sectors are continuing to make private appeals to the British government. The amount of silver currently in the Tianjin British Concession and who it belongs to remains a mystery. It is said that the total amount is over 50 million yuan, with only 13 million yuan stored in the British Concession and the rest stored in the French Concession or the Banque Franco-Chinoise in Beiping. This sum was deposited by the Central Government's Currency Reserve Board in 1935. The ambassadors of Britain and France are paying particular attention to this deposit, and the Reserve Board has also requested that the funds be protected regardless of the situation. According to the Financial Times, the British government has received the opinions of France and the United States regarding the issue of Chinese legal tender in North China. It is expected that the opinions of other signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty will also arrive sooner or later. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) The News Chronicle said in an editorial today that if Parliament were not in recess, there would certainly be sharp criticism of the government's decision to transfer the four Chinese from Tianjin to the Japanese. This decision to show weakness has, as expected, not led to a better spirit in Anglo-Japanese relations. The monster with three heads and a tail is now swallowing a pacifier and preparing to seize the next food. One selfless citizen of Britain has now initiated legal action to protect these four Chinese. What is regrettable for British justice is that resorting to the law comes from private action alone. The British government must now feel that this legal procedure is a major obstacle. The Manchester Guardian said that the government is now anxiously using the judge as a talisman, but even the judge's own power cannot prevent the decision to transfer the four Chinese from being a despicable act. Britain has again made concessions to the Japanese. This is a clear fact. The concessions are not just once, but have been made repeatedly. The Japanese originally claimed that if the four Chinese were not handed over, they would blockade the British Concession in Tianjin. Now Britain has handed over the four Chinese, but the blockade has not been lifted. The Daily Telegraph, under the headline "After Two Years of War," said that the Japanese military representative attending the Anglo-Japanese conference returned to Tianjin quickly, and the increasingly fierce anti-British movement in North China did not encourage the hope that the Tokyo talks could achieve satisfactory results soon. However, there is no other way to go but to continue talking, in order to allow Japan, which claims to be responsible for maintaining order in the Chinese occupied territories, to achieve its goals. Japan wants to expand the scope of the Tokyo talks to include the issue of banning the use of legal tender in North China and confiscating Chinese silver deposits in Tianjin. Japan may think that the China incident has replaced the Nine-Power Treaty, which hinders Chinese territorial and administrative integrity, but in Britain, the treaty is still valid and does not allow unilateral action. Two years after the war, the possibility of Japan establishing a peaceful regime in China is even more remote than at the beginning of the war. Japan's control does not extend beyond the range of its guns, but Japan's economy has not yet shown signs of collapse. The increasingly tense situation in the Far East must be attributed to Japan's strategy. If Japan's repeated statements that the rights of all countries in China will be fully respected were not accompanied by the fact that these rights are disregarded in any disposition where its military gains victory, then their value would be great. The newspaper also strongly stated that the Chinese people have forged a nation under this blow, capable of heroic sacrifice to defend the territory still ruled by Chairman Chiang. The newspaper concluded by saying that although Japan has issued a declaration that it will not negotiate with Chairman Chiang on any basis, there is no possibility of achieving peace without the approval of the Chinese side. The Chinese government has never been seen and is even less willing to discuss conditions at this time. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>Poland's Attitude Firm; Vigilance Against Germany Unwavering; League of Nations High Commissioner Returns to Danzig; Met with Hitler to Discuss the Danzig Issue</h3>
<p>(London) Sources close to the Foreign Office here recently announced that League of Nations High Commissioner for the Free City of Danzig, Carl Jacob Burckhardt, had informed the League of Nations Council's Three-Member Committee (composed of representatives from Britain, France, and Sweden, responsible for monitoring the situation in Danzig) last week that he had been invited by the German side to visit Berchtesgaden. He then went there and met with Führer Hitler. He has now returned to the Free City of Danzig and will be in contact with the City Council and the Polish High Commissioner separately, hoping to contribute to the resolution of the Danzig issue. The British Foreign Office has not yet received a report on the details of his conversation with Führer Hitler. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Warsaw According to reliable sources, League of Nations High Commissioner for the Free City of Danzig, Carl Jacob Burckhardt, has arrived in Germany and will meet with Führer Hitler to discuss the Danzig issue. Some political figures here recently commented on this matter, saying that Führer Hitler is still hesitating about what peaceful means Germany will use to take back the city of Danzig, so he wants to discuss with Burckhardt whether a compromise solution acceptable to both Poland and Germany can be found. It can be seen from the fact that after Burckhardt arrived in Germany, the tone of the German newspapers towards Poland has softened slightly. Other political figures believe that from now until the end of this month, when Führer Hitler delivers a speech in the city of Namburg in East Prussia to commemorate the victory of the Battle of Tannenberg in the Great War, relations between Poland and Germany will probably become increasingly tense. The Polish government also believes that the situation is still serious and that vigilance is still necessary. In short, those close to the government all say that the Polish authorities have a firm attitude and will not be moved by empty threats. No matter how fierce Hitler's speech is, they will not be afraid. At this time, they are closely monitoring the movements of German troops along the border and taking appropriate precautions.

<p>(Berlin) The authorities here have not denied the news that League of Nations High Commissioner for the City of Danzig, Carl Jacob Burckhardt, went to Berchtesgaden to meet with Führer Hitler, but they said that the rumor that Führer Hitler planned to convene the Reichstag tomorrow to deliver an important speech is not true.

<h3>Guangxi Inspects Wartime Military Strength; Province Divided into Eight Major Defense Zones; Military Organs Form Inspection Committee</h3>
<p>Guilin correspondence, the Southwest Headquarters, in order to strengthen Guangxi's anti-Japanese strength, has specially divided Guangxi Province into eight major defense zones: (1) Guilin Pingle Zone, (2) Xunzhou Zone, (3) Liuqing Zone, (4) Baise Tianbao Zone, (5) Yongwu Zone, (6) Longzhou Zone, Yulin Zone, (7) Wuzhou Zone. Each zone has a number of regular troops, militia self-defense forces, special forces, and guerrilla forces. All kinds of new non-metallic artillery, military equipment, horses, and equipment are available, and the equipment is extremely detailed. The highest military authorities in Guangxi also believe that it is necessary to thoroughly inspect the province's anti-Japanese military strength, including the training of new troops and various teams, the management of personnel hygiene and internal affairs, and the equipment and storage of weapons, horses, and equipment. Yesterday, a meeting of senior military officers was specially convened to jointly form an inspection committee and formulate methods. Staff will be dispatched monthly to conduct detailed inspections of each training zone once. The inspection personnel are divided into three groups, each with one group leader and one deputy group leader. The troops directly under the Pacification Headquarters, military control zones, militia zones, and various teams are listed as one group, the troops directly under the command of the No. ×× Group Army Headquarters and the entire No. ××× Army are the second group, and the entire No. ××× Army is the third group. Committees are set up under the groups to be in charge of various matters. After the leaders of each group are organized and assigned, they will be assigned to various inspection areas to conduct inspections separately. The committee members for each zone are: Lu Jingcun for the Guilin Pingle Zone, Li Zhukuang for the Xunzhou Zone, Jiang Bolun for the Liuzhou Qingyuan Zone, Xie Zongkeng for the Baise Tianbao Zone, Wei Liantang for the Yongning Ya Zone, Li Chaofang for the Longzhou Zone, Liu Qingfan for the Yulin Zone, and Li Jinjie for the Wuzhou Zone. In addition to supervising and inspecting the above-mentioned items, the committee members in each zone will also conduct detailed inspections of the national defense works, troop deployment, mobilization preparation, guerrilla zone planning, road destruction, clearing the fields, promotion of conscription, organization of militias, and maintenance of public security in each zone, so as to make the entire province a center of overall anti-Japanese military strength.</p>
<h3>In the Raging Torrent; The Loss of Fir Timber on the Min River is Very Significant; Annual Production Value Reaches Seven Million Yuan; This Loss Reaches More Than One Million</h3>
<p>Fuzhou correspondence, among the seven major specialties of Fujian, fir timber ranks second. The production quantity and value are second only to tea. The fir timber producing areas include the Min River basin, which includes Pucheng, Jian'ou, Shaowu, Jiangle, Yong'an, Shaxian, Nanping, Youxi, Datian, Pingnan, Dehua, Yongtai, and other counties; the Ting River basin, which includes Liancheng, Wuping, Shanghang, Yongding, and other counties, Zhangping and other counties; and other basins, which include Pinghe, Ningde, and other counties. Among them, Youxi and Yongtai in the Min River basin, and Zhangping in the Long River basin, have the highest production volume. The fir timber from the Min River basin is all transported to Fuzhou and then sold to various places. The fir timber from the Ting River basin is mostly transferred to Chaozhou and Shantou via Longxi. The value of the products is approximately seven million yuan.</p>
<p>The method of harvesting and transporting is that the timber firms go to various mountains to purchase timber at the end of each winter with money. The timbermen who harvest and transport fir timber in the deep mountains and valleys sell the fir timber to the timber firms in cylinders. The value of each cylinder (i.e., each log) depends on the size of the end diameter, but generally, a cylinder with a diameter of about three feet is worth between two yuan and five jiao and three yuan. After the timber firms purchase the timber, because the timber cylinders are heavy and cannot be transported by human power, they entrust them to the nearby large and small streams in the valleys and use the power of spring and summer rainwater to release them into the large rivers. However, the streams are small and shallow, and the water power is not enough to float the timber cylinders, so simple earth dams are built every thirty or forty steps along the banks of the streams to store stream water for floating the timber. The construction of the dams is extremely simple, only three or five fir cylinders are horizontally stacked or vertically erected in the streams, and the gaps between the cylinders are filled with a mixture of mud and green grass to make them waterproof. The number of earth dams along the banks of each small stream often reaches dozens or two to three hundred.</p>
<p>When the timber cylinders are released to the riverside, the river is wide and deep, and they can be sealed and nailed into rafts and transported to various destinations by tide. This is the situation of the timber cylinders being formed and harvested.</p>
<p>The formation of timber rafts is all at the turn of spring and summer, when torrents often rise and mountain floods inundate. Houses are turned into ruins, and the earth dams of small streams are washed away and swept away. The timber cylinders on the riverside are even more difficult to escape the disaster. Rafts of timber cylinders, both assembled and unassembled, flow downstream with the waves, and many of them flow down the Min River and into the sea. Occasionally, a few cunning merchants take advantage of the flood season to release rafts downstream in the hope of avoiding taxes, which is also not uncommon.</p>
<p>This year, there have been four mountain floods, just when Japanese warships were blockading the estuary. The timber firms were hesitant about the difficulty of exporting, and the flood disaster that was difficult to prevent by human power caused unprecedented losses. According to relevant parties, the cumulative total is more than 200,000 cylinders. At an average of five yuan per cylinder, the value is 1.3 million national currency, which is truly a great disaster.</p>
<p>Most of the timber cylinders flowing downstream are salvaged by villagers along the river. According to past customs, a group of timber merchants jointly organized a "Fir Timber Merchant Salvage and Management Office" and set up agencies in various counties, districts, and towns along the river to be responsible for salvage and preparing prices for redemption. This is the method of post-disaster remedy. The value of the redeemed timber depends on the size of the end diameter for scattered cylinders, averaging from two jiao to three jiao per cylinder. For complete rafts, only a little more than one jiao per cylinder is redeemed.</p>
<p>This year, the mountain floods were connected to flash floods, and the water势 was fierce, flowing into the sea in large numbers. However, there were very few salvagers along the river. Moreover, some local bullies in Jiangkou, Pukou, Shadi, and other villages under the jurisdiction of Minhou County took the opportunity to seize and destroy the timber for firewood. The number of timber cylinders that were destroyed after having their markings removed and resold also reached fifty to sixty thousand. The number of timber cylinders redeemed by the timber firms and salvaged by themselves was only half of the number that was lost.</p>
<p>Fir timber is one of the special products of Fujian Province and is extremely important to the economy of Fujian Province. It is heard that the authorities have strictly ordered the governments of various counties along the river to carefully plan and arrange post-disaster measures and to strictly prohibit the seizure of driftwood in order to benefit timber merchants.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Troops Disturbing Fujian; Various Actions After Landing on Pingtan; Bandit Leader Appointed as Puppet Commander-in-Chief; Many Civilians Detained and Abused</h3>
<p>Fuzhou correspondence, since the Japanese troops landed on Pingtan on July 5, the local order has been extremely chaotic. According to refugees who escaped from Pingtan, on the 5th, more than 300 Japanese troops and bandits, under the cover of five Japanese warships and four airplanes, landed on the island. At that time, the sound of cannons rumbled and the sound of aircraft screeched, and Pingtan immediately fell into a war terror. The Chinese self-defense forces bravely fought back while urging evacuation. They only withdrew after the task was completed. After the Japanese troops landed, they immediately occupied various organs and appointed Yu Xiahao, the leader of the bandits who had let the wolf into the house, as the puppet commander-in-chief of the Fujian Allied Army, colluding with the Japanese to carry out activities everywhere. Most of Yu's troops were bandits from the Fuping area, and they were extremely familiar with the local situation. Whenever they arrived at a house, they would first check the household registration. If there were any strong young men missing, they would insist that the strong young men had joined a certain unit of the Chinese army's self-defense forces and would detain all the women, children, and elderly in the family. Women accounted for the majority of those detained. As for the elderly and children, they would occasionally release one or two if they were offered a large sum of money, but this was rare. Even after being released, they would be covered in bruises and have suffered severe torture. Moreover, after the elderly, children, and women in this family were detained, all the valuables in this family would soon be taken away. The local order in Pingtan is now extremely chaotic. Most of the refugees who failed to escape could not withstand the various oppressions and have been fleeing at risk. However, the Japanese are actively trying to win over a group of local ruffians to carry out the work of the puppet organization. Lin Shaoping, Cai Kenan, Lin Guangzhi, and others, who have committed many evils on weekdays and are despised by the people of Pingtan, have been elevated to positions of power and are acting on stage. Lin Shaoping was appointed as the puppet magistrate of Pingtan County, and Cai Kenan, Lin Guangzhi, and others were appointed to other important puppet positions. There are currently only more than 30 Japanese troops stationed in Pingtan, and the rest are all bandits. Recently, rumors of a counterattack by the Chinese self-defense forces have been very intense, and the bandits are restless and panicked. The puppet allied army headquarters and the puppet county government are connected together, and a large cannon and a machine gun are placed at the door for strict defense. After the refugee finished speaking, he also said that his aunt had been robbed from her home by bandits a decade ago, and there has been no news of her since. His words seemed to be filled with unspeakable sadness and indignation.</p>

<h3>Fate of the Four Chinese in Tianjin; Awaiting Judgment by British Court; Judge Jones Still Studying Carefully; Situation Urgent and Judgment Will Be Made Today; Plaintiffs May Have to Appeal to England</h3>
<p>The extradition case of the four Chinese in Tianjin requested by the Japanese, which is related to the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo, saw the British government issue an order on the night of the 11th to transfer the four suspects from the British Concession authorities in Tianjin to the "North China regime" there. Just as the international community was astonished by the British move, the British Supreme Court in this city appropriately received a telegram from Professor Bentwich of the Department of International Relations at the University of Jerusalem and Miss Florence, director of the BBC, through the famous British lawyer Mr. Lykes of the law office of Ellis in this city, requesting a writ of habeas corpus. Therefore, the attention of all parties concerned about the extradition case of the four Chinese in Tianjin has once again been focused on how the British Supreme Court will decide. The following is a record of the various news items obtained yesterday:</p>
<p>Judgment May Be Announced Today</p>
<p>After the petition was filed with the British Supreme Court, Judge Jones运日 studied the case in detail, and debated the petition with Mr. Lykes, the lawyer, on the afternoon of the 12th. Yesterday, Judge Jones continued to study the reasons given by the defense lawyers in the case. As of last night, the British Supreme Court had not announced any judgment on the case, nor had any official documents related to the case been made public. It is generally expected that because this case urgently needs to be dealt with in terms of the situation, the judgment document may be announced today (15th).</p>
<p>Appeal to England in Case of Failure</p>
<p>Those concerned about the case are still unable to find out how the Supreme Court will rule. However, according to news from Western sources, if the Supreme Court believes that the request for a "writ of habeas corpus" filed by the petitioners is appropriate, it will proceed along this path. If the Supreme Court rejects this request, the petitioners will continue to appeal to the High Court in London, England, in order to implement the original intention of their request.</p>
<p>Interpretation of Writ of Habeas Corpus</p>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post said that regarding the extradition of the four Chinese suspects in Tianjin to the Japanese authorities in the city, the "writ of habeas corpus" submitted to the British Supreme Court in Shanghai last week, the so-called writ of habeas corpus, is a writ issued by the High Court in accordance with English law, ordering the recipient of the writ to send the person detained by him to the High Court or other court for interrogation, in order to protect human rights and terminate all illegal imprisonment. It is a remedy for the destruction of individual freedom. The case has not yet been judged yesterday. It is reported that this judgment was requested by the defense lawyer Mr. Lykes to Judge Jones. Judge Jones is still studying the matter this (14th) morning and may announce the judgment document tomorrow (15th).</p>
<p>This Case is Unique in China</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times said that the petition filed by the two lawyers Mr. Jones and Mr. Lykes of the famous English lawyer Ellis's office to Judge Jones of the British Supreme Court in China on Saturday and Sunday is generally considered to be unique in British legal proceedings in China, and perhaps the fate of the four Chinese suspects in Tianjin is at stake. Not only in Shanghai, but also in London and Tokyo, the greatest concern is awaiting judgment.</p>
<p>British Handover Arouses Criticism</p>
<p>It is reported that this petition is related to the four Chinese in the assassination case of a Chinese official of the "Provisional Government" several months ago. These suspects are currently being detained by the British authorities in Tianjin. The transfer of these suspects to the Japanese military and the authorities of the "Provisional Government" in Beiping has always been opposed by the British authorities, and in the past week or so, it has become part of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo. The British government's decision to hand over the suspects has caused some criticism in Britain. Professor Bentwich of the Department of International Relations and Miss Florence, director of the BBC, have also risen up to oppose it.</p>
<p>Jones' Verdict is Very Important</p>
<p>On Friday and Sunday nights, a telegram was received from Miss Bentwich and Miss Florence, asking to submit a one-sided petition, requesting a conditional judgment on the writ of habeas corpus. This petition was submitted to Judge Jones on Saturday and Sunday mornings, and Jones and Lykes debated this petition throughout the afternoon of Saturday and Sunday. Judge Jones subsequently postponed the judgment. Considering the urgency of the situation, it is necessary to make a judgment immediately. It is believed that Judge Jones will make a judgment today (14th) or tomorrow (15th). This petition requests that a writ of habeas corpus be issued to the police officers of the Tianjin British Concession's Municipal Council who detained the four suspects. It is generally believed that if a conditional judgment is issued, the judgment may be required to be implemented, or it may make it independent and self-existent. Therefore, it is believed that Judge Jones's judgment is very important.</p>
<h3>Some Faculty and Staff Call for Salary Increase; Request for Increased Tuition Fees to Compensate for Shortfalls</h3>
<p>Dai Yangren, Jin Jing, Zhou Jintao, Li Chunyi, Zhu Huaifu, Dai Zhijiang, and more than 100 others in the education field in this city, in view of the fact that in this time of soaring prices, it is difficult for most workers in the education field to maintain a livelihood, specially expressed their opinions on this matter in a joint statement, saying that since the outbreak of the war two years ago, in addition to the original schools in Shanghai, the schools in the occupied areas have also moved to Shanghai one after another to find houses and open schools, so that the music of learning will not be interrupted, fulfilling their responsibilities to society and the country. Usually, the colleagues of each school are able to overcome difficulties in the spirit of mutual assistance, but at present, foreign exchange has shrunk sharply, and the prices of clothing, food, housing, and transportation have successively increased by 50% to 80%. Most factories and companies have successively increased the salaries of their employees to make up for the losses. Looking back at the education field, which has always been very poor, most people live in a state of semi-starvation. At this extraordinary time, some even find it difficult to maintain a minimum standard of living, let alone support their families. They think that they are drinking "well water" to survive, but even "tap water" is also increasing in price. We say from an objective and fair standpoint that at present, teachers are indeed the same as other civil servants and need to increase their salaries. Even the schools themselves need to increase their income in order to cope with expenses. Some people say that increasing tuition fees will increase the burden on families, but as long as you keep your head calm, you will realize that because the original salaries of the general salary-earning class have increased, it is not unreasonable to increase some expenses. If his family originally belonged to the wealthy bourgeoisie, then it is even less of a problem. Society can distribute reasonably in this way, which is in line with the economic principle of "balanced revenue and expenditure." May I ask, how can a teacher's life be unstable, and how can he work with peace of mind? Therefore, in our opinion, it is indeed necessary to immediately launch a salary increase for the teachers and staff of general schools whose salaries are below the standard. Schools may wish to appropriately increase tuition fees to compensate for the shortfall, otherwise, if all industries increase salaries, but the education field is left out, it will inevitably be unfair, making it impossible for ordinary teachers and staff who are already poor to make a living. We hope that social public groups and enthusiastic people will actively provide relief.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Line Ships Set Up Ticket Office in Zhenhai</h3>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo line ships, concentrated outside Zhenhai port, were experiencing delays due to the time-consuming barge transfers. To facilitate passengers, each shipping line has specially established a ticket office in Zhenhai and hired designated barges for orderly boarding and transfer to ensure safety. Strictly prohibiting rushing and disorder.</p>
<h3>Authorities of Two Concessions Lifted Alert Last Night; No Accidents Occurred on the 6th; City Streets to Return to Normal Starting This Morning</h3>
<p>The police authorities of the two concessions in this city, in order to maintain order and tranquility during the [Shanghai] War Anniversary period, had jointly announced and implemented a temporary emergency alert since the 9th. In addition to regulating or restricting traffic on all major roads, all vehicles and pedestrians were strictly inspected. Furthermore, all police forces were dispatched to assist the defense forces of various districts and countries, as well as the Merchant Corps Volunteers, patrolling back and forth on all roads in patrol cars and armored vehicles, day and night, which was very arduous. The area around the newspaper offices was even more specially and thoroughly guarded. Therefore, peace has been maintained in recent days. The police authorities expressed deep satisfaction with this. In consideration of the city's situation, they officially announced the lifting of the emergency alert order starting at 10:00 PM last night. All obstacles and sandbags will also be removed accordingly. However, ordinary alerts, routine patrols, and temporary inspections will still be carried out as usual. As for the curfew, it is still being strictly enforced.</p>
<p>Ample Police Force, Peaceful Order</p>
<p>The police authorities of the two concessions, in order to prevent the second anniversary of the Shanghai War and ensure peace within the boundaries, decided after consultation with merchants to begin special alerts on the morning of the 9th. All roads and alleys along the borders of the British and French concessions, except for those necessary, were completely blocked, cutting off traffic. All police personnel were dispatched to patrol and search. On the 12th and 13th, troops stationed from various countries, as well as the International Merchant Volunteers, were mobilized and deployed in different areas. The situation was extremely tense. Due to the abundance of the authorities' police force and the strictness of the precautions, the anniversary of the Shanghai War was passed peacefully. Yesterday was the 14th, and the two concessions continued the alert for one more day, but the situation has eased.</p>
<p>Ordinary Alert to Continue</p>
<p>It is also learned that the authorities of the two concessions, considering the current state of emergency, the surge in population in Shanghai, and the complexity of the elements, while announcing the lifting of the special alert starting this morning, the ordinary alert will continue as usual. The original patrol teams of each police station will still be dispatched as usual to search pedestrians to maintain order within the boundaries.</p>
<p>North of the Suzhou Creek, Alert Not Relaxed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the alert on the north side of the Suzhou Creek bridge was still quite strict. For example, the New Rubbish Bridge and the Pentang Alley Bridge were still being continuously blocked. The Old Rubbish Bridge was still only open to vehicles, and the Old Gate Bridge was only open to pedestrians. Both ends of the bridge were guarded and inspected by detectives. Although the Tianhou Palace Bridge was open to both pedestrians and vehicles, iron wire racks were placed on the bridge, and inspections were also very strict. The newly blocked area by the Japanese on North Jiangxi Road still only had an opening at the Haining Road intersection, which could be accessed with a newly issued pass. The concession authorities at the west end have blocked all horizontal roads and alleys, with only the west entrance of Haining Road and the west entrance of Qipu Road accessible to that road. The iron gates on North Henan Road, North Shanxi Road, and Keneng Road leading to the concession road were all closed. The iron gate at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Erjin Road was also closed. However, there was a gap on the east side of the iron gate that could be used to enter and exit, leading to the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and the concession road. The intersection of Erjin Road and North Zhejiang Road was still blocked. Therefore, trams on Routes 5, 6, and 7 only went to the entrance of the First Special Court. Due to the blocking of the New Rubbish Bridge, trolleybuses on Route 18, when arriving at the Nicheng Bridge, turned to Beijing Road, passed the Tianhou Palace Bridge, and reached the Old Parade Ground intersection, temporarily changing their route.</p>
<p>Arrest of Hooligans, Deportation</p>
<p>In the past two days, the French police have arrested a total of sixty to seventy unemployed hooligans in the areas of East New Bridge, West New Bridge, and Zilaihuo Street. After being taken to the police station for investigation, it was found that these individuals had committed extortion cases and had previously received criminal punishments. The police authorities believed that in this tense situation, if these individuals were tolerated and released, it would have a great impact on local order. Therefore, it has been decided to deport all of them in order to maintain security within the boundaries.</p>
<h3>Fuel Prices Rise, Coal Market Stable, Publicly Agreed Coal Ball Prices</h3>
<p>The coal market previously suffered from the impact of the black market foreign exchange squeeze, and prices of all goods were raised across the board, order was chaotic, and transactions were suspended. It is understood that the market has a total of more than 200 participating firms, opening at 1:00 PM every day and closing at 3:00 PM. Now the market has stabilized due to the relaxation of the foreign exchange situation and increased sources. However, Japanese coal is active in the market, attempting to compete with foreign coal sales, and its prices are also lower.</p>
<p>Coal Ball Prices Rise</p>
<p>The Coal Ball Industry Association convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors on the afternoon of the 11th of this month due to the recent soaring prices of coal dross in the coal market, increasing the cost for industry members. The results of the meeting were: (1) The wholesale price increased from 55 yuan and 54 yuan to 62 yuan per ton; (2) The retail price increased from 3 yuan to 3.4 yuan per 100 market catties. However, the repeated soaring prices of coal balls have greatly harmed the common people.</p>
<p>Firewood and Charcoal Stagnant</p>
<p>Various kinds of firewood and charcoal needed by the citizens of this city have always been purchased by members of the Firewood and Charcoal Industry Association who are sent to Wenzhou and Huangyan, Zhejiang, and other places. Since the blockade of the Oujiang River in Wenzhou, the source of firewood and charcoal has been interrupted. Fortunately, there were sufficient reserves, so there was not much impact. For more than two months, the reserves have decreased, and the source has been stagnant. They are all transported to Shanghai via Ningbo and Zhenhai, increasing costs. Prices of all goods have uniformly increased by 10% to 20%.</p>

<h3>Fighting Near Xin Zhuang, Chinese Army's 45th Brigade Marches Directly to Jiashan, Villages Along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line Burned Terribly</h3>
<p>The waterway traffic between Shanghai and Pinghu, with the Shanghai-Pinghu liner composed of Chinese but fronted by Japanese businesses, still only operates as far as Zhujing in Jinshan County. Above Zhujing, because the Chinese army in charge has implemented blockades in Xintai, Langxia, Luxiang and other places, allowing only sampans and sailboats to enter and exit, scheduled sailings cannot resume. Therefore, Zhujing Town has essentially become a transfer checkpoint between Shanghai and Pinghu. According to news from the shipping industry, the 45th Brigade of the Chinese Regular Army, which is active on the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border, a few days ago joined forces with the Chinese army in the Sujia region and attacked Jiashan in two routes, making a bold move to cut off the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. Jiashan suffered successive defeats due to the thin Japanese forces, closing the city gates and holding firm. The Chinese army marched directly under the city walls, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road was also cut off, besieging the city walls for a day and a night. Only after Japanese reinforcements arrived did they move towards the surrounding countryside.</p>
<p>Casualties on Both Sides on the West Side of Shanghai. According to a miscellaneous grain merchant from Qibao to Shanghai, before dawn the day before yesterday, a certain unit of the Chinese guerrillas in the Wujiatang area, north of Xin Zhuang Station and south of Qibao on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, engaged in a surprise battle with the Japanese army coming from the west of Hongqiao Road. Both sides fired fiercely with light and heavy machine guns, and the gunfire was as dense as continuous beads. Initially, the Japanese army, caught off guard by the strong enemy, suffered some casualties and retreated slightly. Soon, a large Japanese reinforcement arrived and fired small steel cannons to assist in the battle. The Chinese side, due to its thin forces and lack of ammunition, began to disperse and retreat in order to preserve its strength. The fierce battle lasted for as long as three hours. Although the Japanese army suffered heavy losses, the Chinese side also suffered great sacrifices. Unexpectedly, after all the Chinese guerrillas had retreated, the Japanese army set fire to the villages near Wujiatang, burning them down. In an instant, the fire blazed into the sky, and cries shook the ground. In addition to the innocent farmers who were killed by stray bullets due to their inability to escape during the fierce battle, a portion of the women and children died while defending their homes and ended up being buried in the fire. Those who saw it were saddened, those who heard it shed tears. There is no hell on earth as tragic as this.</p>
<p>Villages Northwest of Xin Zhuang Looted. A certain team under Xu Xinzhou's command of the 3rd Regiment of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Team was recently ordered to move from a certain place to Chujiatang in the southwest of Qibao (about three or four miles northwest of Xin Zhuang) in order to attack the Japanese army headquarters at Xin Zhuang Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road. Unexpectedly, the plan was not secret and was discovered by the Japanese army, who immediately dispatched a large unit of more than 100 Japanese soldiers to the address around 4:00 AM on the morning of the 13th, surrounding Chujiatang on all sides, using small copper cannons and heavy machine guns to bombard it. Xu's brave soldiers were all awakened from their dreams and hastily resisted. However, the artillery fire was fierce and difficult to resist, and the disparity in strength was too great to win. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, they ordered a retreat after fighting fiercely until about 6:00 AM. In this battle, the Japanese side suffered six or seven deaths, and Xu's platoon leader, Jin Qiugen (25 years old, from Miaoren, Beihua Village, Meilong Town) was killed, and more than ten people were injured. The Japanese soldiers then moved into the three villages of Chujiatang, Wujiatang, and Matong Bridge, searching house by house, and shooting innocent civilians. The Japanese army only left at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Two Armies Engaged in a Long and Fierce Battle. Also, it is reported that Wengban Bridge Town, which belongs to Shanghai County, was suddenly visited by a large unit of Japanese troops stationed in Xin Zhuang, carrying small steel cannons and other equipment, who rushed to [blank], conducting strict searches. They then searched various villages such as Zhujiatang, Shengjiaxiang, Sunjia's graveyard, and Luowang Temple near the town. As a result, a small number of discarded guns and residual bullets were found and taken away. However, when the Japanese army first arrived in the town, they indiscriminately bombarded it, causing three villagers to be hit by stray bullets and die from their injuries one after another. The surrounding area is now in a serious situation, and many residents are fleeing. In a certain village between Qibao and Xin Zhuang, Chinese guerrillas and the Japanese army engaged in a surprise battle the day before yesterday. The sound of artillery and guns was constantly heard for about two or three hours before gradually subsiding. Later, according to those who came from the area, a large unit of Japanese troops went to support from Xin Zhuang, and it is estimated that the fighting there will inevitably be fierce.</p>
<p>Vegetables in Pudong Will Be Sold Under Control Starting Tomorrow; Annual Production Reaches 400,000 to 500,000 Yuan; Control Should Prevent Panic. The vegetables and fruits in this city have always relied on transportation from Pudong, Xujiahui, Beixinjing, Fanwangdu, Huangdu, Hangzhou, and other places for supply. The day before yesterday, Pudong City suddenly posted a notice controlling Pudong vegetables, which is of great importance to the lives of citizens. Before the war, due to convenient transportation and smooth sources, there was no panic. After the war, due to traffic congestion, the prices of various vegetables have risen by 30% to 50% compared to before the war. Before the war, the total annual transaction volume in the 16th Puli was 20 million yuan, about 10 million yuan in Nanshi, and 400,000 to 500,000 yuan in Pudong. Pudong vegetables account for only one-tenth of the total supply to Shanghai, but Pudong's various vegetables arrive in Shanghai every day, and there are more than 4,000 vegetable vendors. Green vegetables are a necessity for Shanghai residents, and Pudong's transportation to Shanghai accounts for one-fifth. Usually, they mostly cross the river from Dongjiadu and Lannidu. Now that Hongkou has implemented control, although it has not yet caused a vegetable panic, prices will inevitably rise, which will affect the people's food supply. Furthermore, according to a reporter's record from Pudong, the notice is as follows: "Notice: This market has received orders from the Qiji Garrison and permission from the Pudong Detachment of the Naval Special Landing Force. All vegetables and other items produced in Pudong must be exported and directly transported to the Hongkou area for sale by Qichang Trading Company designated by this market. For all details, please inquire at the Pudong Temporary Office of this market at 334 Dajie, Qichang Trading Company. It will be implemented starting on August 16. All local households and vegetable vendors should pay attention. This notice." The Soviet Acting Consul General</p>
<p>Ordered to Return Home. Dalu Bao reported that Mr. Ximanski, the Soviet Acting Consul General in Shanghai, received an order to return home two months ago and is scheduled to depart for the Soviet Union tomorrow (the 15th) on the President Doumer.</p>
<h3>Handling Small Change Stamps, Requesting Instructions from the Head Office, Extremely Difficult to Handle Overly Soiled Stamps</h3>
<p>Since the disappearance of copper coins from the city, small change has been difficult to use, and various circles have replaced them with stamps. For a time, one-cent, two-cent, and five-cent stamps of the postal service were in great demand. In the past two months, the number of these stamps circulating in the market has been as high as [blank], accounting for about 400,000 yuan. However, due to the length of time and daily use, most of them are soiled and unusable. Now, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the Central Bank to print one-cent and five-cent auxiliary currency notes, attaching 300,000 yuan for one-cent notes and 200,000 yuan for five-cent notes, totaling 500,000 yuan. These fractional currency notes can be printed within days and will be issued by the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank. Moreover, they are only applicable to Shanghai, and at that time, the 440,000 odd scattered stamps will inevitably cause serious problems. In particular, small businesses hold a larger number of these stamps. Since the news of the impending issuance of fractional currency notes spread, the use of stamps in the market has been stagnant. Therefore, a small number of merchants have requested relevant groups to forward letters to the Shanghai Postal Administration, suggesting a deadline for the recovery of all soiled stamps. According to the reporter from Xinsheng News Agency who inquired at the Shanghai Postal Administration, the administration is currently happy to accept the suggestions from various circles regarding these soiled stamps. However, due to postal regulations, it is still considering the issue, according to a senior official of the administration, or plans to request instructions from the Kunming Postal Headquarters of the Ministry of Communications for proper handling. However, those that are excessively soiled are particularly difficult to handle.</p>
<h3>Organized Anti-British Movement Has Spread to Shanghai; Japanese Soldiers Supervise Coolies Distributing Leaflets; White Russians Participate in Parades with Shamefaced Expressions</h3>
<p>Dalu Bao reported that anti-British agitation spread to Shanghai yesterday (the 13th) morning, which is of great significance. Chinese coolies, under the supervision of Japanese soldiers, distributed leaflets to villagers in the Hongqiao area denouncing Britain and vehemently criticizing British policy, while urging action against the British in China. Regarding the latter, the leaflet stated four key points: (1) Chinese employed by British companies in the Shanghai area should resign within one week; (2) Chinese women married to British nationals should begin divorce proceedings; (3) Chinese should acquire all British church properties in Japanese-occupied areas within China; (4) Boycott British commercial organizations, including commercial firms and banks. According to eyewitnesses, the leaflets seemed to have little impact on the Chinese villagers, who are mostly illiterate. After receiving the leaflets, most of them abandoned them.</p>
<p>Airplane Leaflets Scattered by Wind. Yesterday afternoon, an airplane scattered leaflets opposing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in the Shanghai sky, but a gust of wind blew most of the leaflets to the suburbs, and only a few fell in the commercial district. There were two demonstrations with anti-Chiang and anti-British characteristics in Hongkou yesterday, but there was no violence. There were no bombings or other terrorist activities in the Public Concession and the French Concession, so the second anniversary of the Shanghai War can be said to have passed peacefully.</p>
<p>Demonstration Parades Clearly Have Backers. One of the two demonstration parades took place before noon. Approximately 7,000 Japanese, 4,000 Koreans, and 20,000 Chinese gathered in Hongkou Park to listen to speeches by the Japanese. Near noon, the demonstrators marched to the Japanese Consulate and sent representatives to present a "painting thanking the Japanese" to consulate officials. In the afternoon, around 2:00 PM, there was another demonstration parade, shouting anti-British and anti-Chiang slogans. It is estimated that about 3,000 people participated, including 1,500 Chinese and 300 White Russians. There was an armored car in the procession, with armed Japanese soldiers on the roof and sides. The demonstrators were in front of and behind the car, waving Japanese flags and five-colored flags, as well as German, Italian, and old Russian flags, proceeding along the roads of Hongkou. On both sides of the procession, Japanese and Chinese people in cars distributed anti-Chiang leaflets. It dispersed before evening. The Chinese and White Russians seemed very unhappy with the parade. Some White Russians turned their heads with shame when they saw that they were being noticed by foreigners.</p>
<p>White Russians Paid Five Corners to Participate. Also, the Zi Lin Daily reported that the Hongkou demonstration parade departed from North Sichuan Road at the corner of Paizilu just after 2:15 PM. Approximately 1,500 Japanese primary and secondary school students and 50 White Russians participated. It ended an hour later. It is reported that the White Russians each received 5 jiao of Huaxing currency for assisting in the parade. After the procession passed North Sichuan Road and North Suzhou Road, it stopped at the intersection of Broadway Road and North Suzhou Road. One person came out and spoke for some time, and then turned into Broadway Road and Xihua Road, singing patriotic songs, waving Japanese flags, and distributing leaflets along the way.</p>
<p>Puppets Presiding Over District Management. During the day, there was also new anti-British propaganda. The location for the previous day was in the city center, presided over by the puppet "Director" Peng Bin. Yesterday, there were also anti-British movements in Pudong Nanshi. In Pudong, Zhu Ding of the Damin Association presided over the event, summoning more than 100 "Dadong primary school students" to hold a meeting in the Huaiyang Theatre and parade with puppet flags. In Nanshi, Shen Shijing, the puppet district office director, also led a group of ignorant people to parade with flags.</p>
<p>Leaflets Found on Four People. Yesterday at noon, four Chinese people entered the concession by crossing the Yichang Road Bridge from the north side. At that time, British soldiers and Chinese and Western detectives stationed on the south side of the bridge searched them and found anti-British leaflets on each of the four people. They were detained and taken to the Putuo Road Police Station. It is reported that the four people claimed that they were approached and given the leaflets as they were about to enter the concession from the north side of the bridge. The four people carried them across the bridge out of fear of refusal, and were eventually caught. The police station, in order to facilitate investigation into the nature of their actions, specially transferred them to the political department of the General Inspectorate for investigation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Police Force Annual Inspection</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has scheduled the annual inspection of the police force to be held at 11:00 AM on Sunday, October 29. Mr. F.C.Pringle, the Chairman of the Council, will be the inspecting officer.</p>

<h3>Jewish Refugees No Longer Allowed to Come to Shanghai; Shanghai Municipal Council Believes Its Work Is Already Exhausted; It Is Time for Assistance from Other Places</h3>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council recently decided to no longer allow European Jewish refugees to enter Shanghai, with the possible exception of refugees who have already boarded ships. The Municipal Council has sent letters to all consulates, shipping companies, and Mr. Hayim, (to be forwarded to the various Jewish organizations in Shanghai) informing them of the Council's decision. According to a spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council today (14th), the work done by Shanghai for European refugees has already been sufficient. Cheever does not believe that the Municipal Council lacks sympathy for the refugees, but Shanghai can no longer absorb refugees to prevent municipal affairs from reaching the point of being heavily burdened. If the unofficial news that the Japanese authorities will no longer allow immigrants to settle on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek is true, then the north bank of the Suzhou Creek will certainly have no room for them. The Municipal Council has not provided a large amount of economic assistance to the refugees. The local Jewish organizations have done a good job in assisting immigrants. The Municipal Council has assisted by providing vacant houses and land for use. However, the sudden arrival of a large number of refugees has given the already busy police force extra work, and unlimited refugee arrivals will add burdens to all municipal affairs. A large increase in medical services is just one example. Shanghai has done more than its share, and it is time for others to provide assistance. The Municipal Council understands that refugees may think that everything in Shanghai will be better than the situation in the places they left, but coming to a city that is not well prepared for them is also detrimental to the refugees themselves. Refugees who have already boarded ships will not be forced to leave, as they should be allowed to enter the country for humanitarian reasons. It is reported that a total of 15,000 Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria have arrived in Shanghai. According to the Municipal Council's prediction before making this decision, another 5,000 people will arrive this year. It is estimated that 500 people have already set out for Shanghai this morning. These people will be the last batch of refugees to be allowed to enter the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>Japanese Izumo Warship Leaves Shanghai; Rumored to Be Heading to Qingdao for Patrol; But This Claim Has Not Been Confirmed</h3>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that the Izumo, the flagship of the Japanese Third Fleet stationed in Chinese waters, which has been docked at the old post pier on Huangpu Road for nearly a year, sailed out of Shanghai at 10:00 AM this morning (the 14th). It is rumored that the ship is sailing to Qingdao for a routine patrol and will return to Shanghai at the beginning of next month. However, this claim has not been verified. When the Izumo returns to Shanghai, it may inspect the Japanese warships stationed at the Yangtze River estuary and at the various ports on the Yangtze River near Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Holy Land Putuoshan; Japanese Soldiers Withdraw Completely; Situation on the Mountain Is Relatively Quiet; Temple Fairs Are Desolate, No One Is Visiting for Summer Retreat</h3>
<p>Putuoshan, which belongs to Dinghai County, is a Buddhist holy land. Since the start of the war, the area has been coveted by the Japanese, who have repeatedly tried to land. Since the fall of Dinghai, the area was also forcibly landed by the Japanese army under the cover of Japanese warships on the 2nd of last month. More than 70 Japanese soldiers were stationed at the Puji Temple and the Baoben Hall. Now, a month later, at the beginning of last week, the Japanese soldiers all returned to their ships by motorboat. The situation on the mountain is now relatively peaceful. However, the temple fairs are desolate, and no one is visiting for summer retreat. The monks on the mountain, who rely on the income from the temple fairs for a year's worth of food and clothing, have no income at all and all look malnourished. The temples that have branch temples in Shanghai, that is, branch temples, are now actively moving to Shanghai to make up for the losses. The Putuo temple fairs are the best in the country. In its heyday, the monks on the mountain were all well-fed and well-dressed, living a comfortable life. They have never encountered this year's situation, which can be said to be a misfortune for the Buddhist community on the mountain.</p>
<h3>National Goods Factory United Association Plans to Set Up a Kunming Branch; Transportation Circles Have Been Invited to Transfer There; Plans to Develop Transportation in Western China</h3>
<p>Various national goods manufacturers in this city, in view of the central government's recent efforts to build important cities and towns in the southwest, are sparing no effort to assist the government, promote national products, and connect the interior. They have specially dispatched cadres to Kunming, Chengdu, Xikang, Guilin, and other places to conduct on-the-spot inspections and actively prepare to set up branch factories in those places, increase production, and promote the adoption of national goods by the people. According to the reporter from Daguang News Agency who inquired in the national goods circles yesterday, the National Goods Factory United Association of this city, considering that its members have invested a large amount of capital in the southwestern provinces, in order to facilitate the transfer of orders from the central government and encourage the development of national products, has prepared to set up a Kunming branch. Once the assembly is complete, members will be convened to discuss association affairs. It is also learned that famous figures in the transportation circles of this city have been invited by the central government to go to Haiphong and transfer to Kunming. It is said that they will plan to develop the transportation business in Western China.</p>
<h3>Battle of Jinhui Bridge, Japanese Army Suffered Considerable Casualties</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, during the day, a team of more than 100 Japanese soldiers from Punan entered through the Zhagang port and invaded the Jinhui Bridge Town on the Fengnan border. They engaged in a fierce battle with the troops of Pei Zilin under Ding Xishan's command there. Before the Japanese army invaded, Pei's troops had received intelligence early on, so they arranged a clever line of defense, moving the main force to both sides and leaving a small number of troops to guard the town. The Japanese army concentrated their guns and cannons and bombarded the town. Just as they were feeling triumphant, the machine guns of the guerrillas on both sides swept in densely, so the Japanese suffered considerable casualties. When they rushed to the town, they realized it was an empty formation. Now, the Japanese army that arrived at Jinhui Bridge Town is surrounded by guerrillas on all sides, trapped in a dilemma of advancing or retreating.</p>

<h3>Rising Prices: Another Corner of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Wen Qin</p>
<p>A Stroll Through the Vegetable Market and Snack Stalls</p>
<p>In search of something new to try, I took a vegetable basket and a small umbrella on a midsummer morning, and without any attendants, went alone to the Route Père Robert vegetable market nearby to buy vegetables, taking the opportunity to stroll through the snack stalls next to it. In these times of expensive goods, of course, these snack items have also been drawn into the whirlpool of price increases. Extracting some fragments from the stallholders' complaints can be considered a report from another corner of society.</p>
<p>Because it was still early, the pedestrians on Route Père Robert were still sparse. A few ayis and older sisters, carts full of vegetables, and delivery bicycles temporarily punctuated the quiet street. At the intersection of Route Père Robert, Route Maybert and Route des Soeurs stood a sign, "Single-wheeled vehicles, this road is only allowed from south to north, not from north to south." This sign is located on the northwest corner of the vegetable market, ten or so storefronts south and twenty or so storefronts east. The area is the multiplication of length and width, which is the area of this small vegetable market. This vegetable market is not as grand as the Eight Immortals Bridge vegetable market, nor is the market as prosperous as the Chenjiabang vegetable market, but it is also small and exquisite, and it is still a first-class vegetable market. If you find other vegetable markets too noisy, you may as well come here to shop, and you are sure to have a satisfactory harvest!</p>
<p>On the northern edge of this vegetable market are rows of various snack stalls, hot and cold, meat and vegetarian, dry and wet, everything is available, a spectacular sight. Among them, the most are the big pancake stalls, accounting for at least thirty to forty percent. Because I knew that big pancakes had recently risen to two cents each, I wanted to learn more about the situation from the practitioners, so I approached a pancake stall. First, I bought two big pancakes, which were indeed much bigger than before. Next to them was a round cake that was two cents longer in diameter than the flaky pastry, costing one cent each. At that time, an old woman was cooking a pancake, so I asked her with a respectful and sincere attitude, "Grandma, what is this pancake called?" Then her talkativeness was opened, she said that this is an oil pancake, one dime each, formerly five cents each; next to it, a thick and hard one is called "qiang" (I don't know which character), and it sells for five dimes each, which is cut open and sold separately; fried dough sticks are two cents each. She said that the fried dough sticks are much longer than before, and also talked about the expensiveness of flour, which used to be three yuan a bag, but now it costs more than six yuan a bag; sesame seeds are one yuan for two catties, which used to be able to buy four or five catties; coal dross costs more than four yuan a load, which used to be only two yuan. At this time, her oil pancake was already cooked, and when she lifted the flat pan, I found that she was burning coal briquettes underneath. She further stated that this furnace body is shallow and not suitable for burning coal dross. She also said sadly: "Alas, coal briquettes are also expensive now, three yuan and three cents a load!" She looked at me sincerely, and I nodded sympathetically.</p>
<p>To the right of her, a close neighbor is a porridge stall. Bowls of hot white porridge, as well as mung bean porridge, are squatting on the board table. Several coolies are sitting next to the table, sipping porridge. The porridge dishes include yellow beans, peanuts, fermented bean curd, and preserved eggs. Except for the first three, which are favored by customers, no one cares about the preserved eggs. A large bowl of porridge costs four cents, a small dish of beans two cents, and a small piece of fermented bean curd one cent. It only costs six cents to buy a full meal, which is very affordable. Just as I was about to turn around and leave, I saw a bright red paper in a glass frame on the table. I saw a few lines of small characters written on it, and I still remember, "Dear customers, please forgive me, six cents is rounded down, seven cents is rounded up, this owner is honest." I really feel straightforward and cute, but I don't quite understand its true meaning, it is probably about stamps and hair tickets. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Forced Abortion Case, Maid Appeals to High Court, Collegial Panel Held Hearing Yesterday, Appellant Did Not Attend Due to Illness</h3>
<p>Ma Caizhen, a woman from Pinghu, previously retained lawyer Yan Zhaolin to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Court, accusing her master, Lu Qinsheng, a wealthy merchant from the same hometown, his wife Lu Xing, their son-in-law Zhu Zizhao and his wife Zhu Lu, and Doctor Yang Zhongfu, etc., of seduction,</p>
<p>Inciting Abortion,</p>
<p>Aiding and Abetting Abortion, etc. During the trial, Lu suddenly incited a maid, Xu Shen, to testify, falsely claiming to be Ma Caizhen's maternal aunt, and also incited Li Zhou to impersonate Ma's biological mother, proving that Ma was only 19 years old and had no capacity to sue, intending to overturn the previous case, and filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division to confirm that Ma Caizhen was his biological daughter, but the plaintiff's lawsuit was rejected. Therefore, Ma again</p>
<p>Filed a Supplementary Complaint</p>
<p>Accusing Lu Qinsheng, Li Zhou, Xu Shen, etc. of inciting perjury, etc. The defendants also retained lawyers Xu Wufang and Sun Zuji to defend them. The first instance of the case was concluded by Judge Miao Qingbang, who sentenced Lu Xing to six months' imprisonment. Lu Qinsheng avoided appearing in court and was wanted. The rest of the parts were found not guilty. Since the judgment, both parties</p>
<p>Were Dissatisfied</p>
<p>And have appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. After the High Court received the complaint, Chief Judge Wu Tingqi, accompanied by judges Gu and Wu, held a collegial panel to summon them yesterday. Ma did not attend due to illness. Her representative lawyer said that the appellant Ma Caizhen's health had been affected by the abortion, and she was bedridden and unable to speak. She is currently being treated in the hospital and requested an adjournment. The court approved the request and changed the date for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Lands in Fuzhou, Trend Dissipates, Only One Level of Wind Force Remains, Not Felt to Be Fierce</h3>
<p>The newly formed hurricane in the Pacific Ocean landed yesterday morning and reached the west of Fuzhou in the afternoon, showing a trend of dissipation. According to the Xujiahui Observatory's report at 6:00 a.m. yesterday, the hurricane had reached 25.5 degrees north latitude and 119.5 degrees east longitude, heading west-northwest, with the center within 30 nautical miles. It was the time when the hurricane began to land in Fuzhou.</p>
<p>Shanghai Also Affected</p>
<p>When the hurricane landed, the wind force felt in Fuzhou was not fierce, only about four levels. At that time, the climate in Shanghai suddenly became gloomy, and around 9:00 a.m., there were showers, which were affected by the hurricane landing in Fuzhou and the wind dispersing. Compared to the Observatory's report at 2:00 p.m. yesterday, the hurricane had reached the west of Fuzhou, at 26 degrees north latitude and 119 degrees east longitude, with the center within 60 nautical miles, and the direction was still northwest.</p>
<p>Another Hurricane Moving</p>
<p>The development of the hurricane after landing clearly tends towards dispersal. Because the remaining wind force in Fuzhou yesterday afternoon was only one level. Therefore, it is speculated that it will soon disappear. However, a new hurricane near Guam Island in the Pacific Ocean is also moving west-northwest, far from Shanghai. Therefore, its trend and wind force are still unknown. Also, the highest temperature in Shanghai yesterday was 91.8 degrees, and the lowest was 75 degrees.</p>
<h3>Open-Air Concert Season Coming to an End</h3>
<p>From 9:00 to 11:00 p.m. this (15th) day, if the weather is good, the Municipal Council Orchestra will hold a string concert in Zhaofeng Park. The program includes six items. According to the orchestra's report, this year's summer outdoor concert season is scheduled to end on September 2nd. On that day, the orchestra will hold a string concert at Zhaofeng Park.</p>
<h3>Wen Bao Cherish Writing Bureau Staff In Litigation Due to a Grudge, A Letter Results in a Big Fight, Both Parties Appeal After Unsatisfactory First Instance</h3>
<p>The Wen Bao Cherish Writing Bureau on Route Lagrene in the French Concession is a charitable organization in Shanghai. Its work is to collect discarded paper with writing from various places, gather and incinerate it, to prevent it from drifting all over the ground, being trampled in the mud. The purpose is purely to respect writing, which was regarded by ancient people as a work that prolongs life, eliminates disasters, and brings blessings. Therefore, gentlemen and gentry are willing to donate money to promote it, set up a bureau to hire people</p>
<p>To collect written paper, regarded as accumulating virtue, and included in charitable undertakings, including vegetarianism, chanting scriptures, etc. Up to now, the bureau has purchased its own property to maintain itself, so as not to rely on donations. Although the work has now stopped, there are still some employees retained. Wei Xuanyao and Fang Yunzhi, the two, usually disagree with Wei's handling of bureau affairs and often directly advise him, which causes</p>
<p>Conflicts. Recently, Teng Yunshan, a colleague from Hong Kong, sent a letter to several of them, talking about bureau affairs. Wei refused to allow Fang to read the letter, but Fang believed that he was also one of the recipients and had the right to read it, so a dispute arose. Wei immediately gathered his nephew Weinan and maid Huang to beat Fang severely with wooden stool legs, to vent his accumulated hatred, causing Fang to be injured all over his body. He immediately filed a complaint with the Procuratorate of the Second Special District Court</p>
<p>Requesting an examination of the injuries, and later filed a private prosecution against Wei Xuanyao and others for assault in the Criminal Division of the original court. Wei also filed a counterclaim for assault and defamation. As a result of the first instance, Wei was fined and compensated for medical expenses, and Fang was found not guilty. Therefore, Wei was dissatisfied with the judgment and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court.</p>
<p>Fang entrusted lawyers Zhu Xueyu and Qiu Jiexiu to appear in court to defend him. The case has now been concluded by the collegial panel of the High Court. The judgment was rendered yesterday, rejecting Wei Xuanyao's appeal, granting a two-year suspended sentence, and rejecting both parties' claims in the attached civil suit.</p>

<h3>Immersed in Gambling Dens, Accused of Defrauding Prostitutes of Money, Police Have Prosecuted a Case of 45,000 Yuan, Defendant Claims It Was a Loan Obtained at High Interest</h3>
<p>Gao Zhenyi, the son of Gao Ziruo, a wealthy silk merchant from Hangzhou, has been frequenting gambling dens such as Hollywood, Qiuyue, and Rongsheng in western Shanghai since seeking refuge in Shanghai, resulting in losses of no less than tens of thousands of gold, causing him to be financially strapped and heavily in debt.

<p>Wendi's fourth mistress, Ying Huizhen, Mrs. Wu Zishen, Xu Lou, Zhang Xiuzhen, and others with sweet words, falsely claiming that they were jointly operating businesses such as rice, salt, cotton, and tobacco, which would surely bring huge profits. Ying and others, deceived by his words, jointly invested six or seventy thousand gold and handed it over to Gao Zhenyi to operate these businesses. However, after Gao defrauded the money, he sent it to various gambling dens. Now, Ying and others have discovered Gao's</p>
<p>Deceptive Behavior</p>
<p>And reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station. Chinese detectives Pang Ruiqing and Zhu Jiaju arrested Gao last Sunday when he left the Qiuyue gambling den and sent him to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention.

The investigation has not been completed, so he still requested an adjournment for another hearing. Gao confessed in the police station that he had 7,000 gold</p>
<p>Handed Over to His Uncle</p>
<p>Gao Zifu (resident of Room 101, Carlton Apartments), etc. When the court questioned Gao Zifu, he replied that the money was borrowed from Zhenyi and returned in installments. Gao Zhenyi confessed that the money from Ying and others was not defrauded, but was a loan, and the interest ranged from 5.4% to 12%. Judge Fang Qinghuan verified the confession and ordered Gao Zhenyi to be returned to detention and adjourned for another hearing in a week.</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Number of Graduates from Higher Education Institutions Nationwide Over the Years Totals More Than 95,800, Two People Out of 10,000 Receive Higher Education</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Chongqing) The Ministry of Education recently compiled detailed statistics on the number and majors of graduates from colleges and universities nationwide over the years. Extracts are provided below. The number of graduates from colleges and universities in previous years has increased or decreased along with the number of students enrolled in the academic year. The number of graduates from colleges and universities before the founding of the Republic of China reached 3,184. The number of graduates in the first year of the Republic of China was 490, which increased to 1,155 in the sixth year, and then decreased to 900 in the seventh year. The reason is that the number of students enrolled in the first, second, and third years was relatively large, so the number of graduates in the fourth and fifth years was also relatively large. After the fourth year, the number of students enrolled decreased, so after the sixth year, the number of graduates also decreased slightly. From the eighth year to the thirteenth year, it increased from 1,137 to 3,397. In the fourteenth year, it decreased to 2,272. In the fifteenth year, it increased to 2,841. In the sixteenth year, it decreased again to 2,714. In the seventeenth year, it decreased to 2,253. From the eighteenth year, it increased again from 4,164 year by year. By the twenty-third year, it increased to 9,622. The reason is that after the seventeenth year, the number of students increased year by year, so when they graduated, the number of graduates also increased accordingly. The number of university graduates in the twentieth year was 6,392, an increase of 2,453 compared to 3,939 in the nineteenth year. The reason is that after the sixteenth year, the number of universities increased year by year, and some graduates from specialized schools transferred to universities to continue their studies. Therefore, from the twentieth year to the twenty-third year, the number of university graduates increased annually. The number of students in colleges and universities nationwide in the twentieth year was the highest in previous years, so the number of graduates in the twenty-third year also increased sharply, making it one of the years with the most graduates since the founding of the Republic of China. From the twenty-first year, the Ministry of Education promoted practical sciences and restricted the establishment of liberal arts schools. In the twenty-second year, it restricted the enrollment of liberal arts students, and the number of students enrolled decreased year by year. Therefore, the number of graduates in the twenty-fourth year also decreased to 8,672, a decrease of 905 compared to the twenty-third year. The number of graduates in the twenty-fifth year was 8,601, a decrease of 1,021 compared to the twenty-third year. However, although the number of graduates in liberal arts, commerce, and other subjects has shown a trend of decreasing year by year, the number of graduates in science, agriculture, engineering, medicine, and other subjects has increased year by year.</p>
<p>In the twenty-sixth year, during the War of Resistance against Japan, the number of graduates from colleges and universities nationwide totaled 5,329, a decrease of 4,293 compared to the 9,622 in the twenty-third year, and a decrease of 3,272 compared to the 8,601 in the twenty-fifth year. The reason for the sharp decrease in the number of graduates in the twenty-sixth year was obviously due to the impact of the war. Some students moved from the war zone to the interior, or temporarily suspended their studies due to economic difficulties, or delayed their enrollment period due to relocation, or some schools were suspended and students dispersed. If we refer to the number of students enrolled in each school in the twenty-sixth year, then the decrease in the number of graduates in the twenty-sixth year is inevitable. In total, from the establishment of colleges and universities in the late Qing Dynasty to the end of the twenty-sixth year, over more than 30 years, there are statistical figures for graduates in our country who have received higher education, totaling 95,813. If the national population is calculated at 474 million, as announced by the Ministry of Interior in the 17th year of the Republic of China, then there are only two college graduates out of 10,000 people.</p>
<h3>Education Expert Wan Minhao Discusses Preparations Before the Exam (Part 1) - The Choice of Department Should Be Decided Early, and Revision Should Begin Once Chosen</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News) Education expert Wan Minhao discussed preparations before the exam. The content is quite concise. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Choosing a Department</p>
<p>The choice of department should be decided early by students seeking higher education. Currently, there are fourteen types of colleges in schools above the vocational level, eighty-eight departments, and another forty-five vocational and specialized courses. Young people naturally feel overwhelmed when they first see such complex departments, hesitating and unable to decide for a long time. In fact, all departments can be studied, but one should choose the one that best suits their individual needs. The selection criteria can be determined based on the needs of the country and individual personality and ability. Young people should take revitalizing the country and nation as their responsibility, and academic research should also prioritize the needs of the country, so that they can contribute what they have learned to the country. The job prospects for talent urgently needed by the country are bound to be better. Therefore, even for personal prospects, this should be the primary selection criterion. The country needs a wide range of talents, but due to the demands of the times, there must be an emphasis on certain areas. In recent years, the educational authorities have been gradually adjusting departments and faculties with this intention. Young people should silently observe the trends and make their choices. Since the late Qing Dynasty, when China began to develop schools, it has emphasized practical subjects. The Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction allows for attention to scientific education. It is undoubtedly necessary for young people to devote themselves to scientific research. To illustrate this further, in today's three-dimensional warfare, a country cannot stand without an air force. China has a vast territory and will need to build a strong air force in the future. While pilots are needed, manufacturing is even more urgent. Therefore, in recent years, universities have added aviation departments. Ambitious young people should not ignore the purpose of these new departments. There are many other equally important departments, so there is no need to list them all. Choosing a department based on the talents needed by the country is still too broad, so personal personality and interests should also be used as a standard. For example, those with clear minds and deep aptitude are suitable for exploring natural sciences, while those with flexible thinking and keen eyes are conducive to the study of social sciences. Those with similar temperaments naturally feel interested, and if they do not feel interested, then it is definitely not suitable for their personality. It is up to individuals to carefully reflect, and it is difficult to prescribe a constant standard to explain this. In senior high school, there is already a distinction between arts and sciences. When a certain subject was chosen at that time, it had already undergone careful consideration. Schools above the vocational level are simply more detailed in their divisions. If applicants can refer to past subject selection criteria and recent learning interests to make a more precise selection, then they will succeed. If a certain subject is considered, the country urgently needs this talent, the individual is also interested in it, but if they assess their ability, it seems to be insufficient, this should never be forced. To study advanced academics, one must first have basic academic ability. Those who guide things according to circumstances are more likely to succeed. Learning often involves conducting deeper research based on one's strengths, so that one can achieve twice the result with half the effort and achieve greater success. Otherwise, one will waste time and energy, which the wise will never do. For example, if one has studied humanities and has not paid much attention to mathematics and science courses, then one should still pursue further studies in humanities. The country does not not need this type of talent, and they will be able to use what they have learned in the future. Do not be tempted by new opportunities and change to studying science and engineering. Not only will there be many difficulties in future studies, but there will also be less hope of being admitted to the entrance exam. In short, applicants can choose several departments that best suit them based on the above criteria, and then fill them in on the application form when registering. For example, the unified enrollment in the 27th year stipulates that students taking the exam, in addition to identifying one department of one school as their first choice, can also select other departments of the same school or departments of other schools as their second, third, or fourth choices, but they should be limited to those with the same set of written exam subjects or those with similar properties.</p>

<h3>Financial Turmoil in Europe Again - Situation Chaotic - Fluctuations Gradually Expanding</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market, although the foreign exchange fluctuations were not as large as last week, the gold market was still quite volatile. The panic has not yet subsided. The process generally involved a sharp rise first, followed by a sharp fall, and then a rebound. The high and low range on that day was also 280 yuan. At first, the situation was very stable. The morning opening was 4,400 yuan. Shortly after the opening, the news of tight foreign exchange stimulated buying. A certain bank absorbed orders on behalf of outsiders, and the price soared to a high of 4,540 yuan. Afterwards, there were rumors that the Exchange Equalization Account would once again maintain the four-pence British gold standard, foreign exchange suddenly relaxed sharply, the market was inherently weak, and general buyers such as securities firms shifted their targets and rushed to sell. The noon close retreated to 4,410 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors spread in the market that the German fleet was moving on the French border, and there were also rumors that the Japanese army representative suddenly left Tokyo to return to office, fearing that the Anglo-Japanese conference would break down. At that time, foreign exchange was firm, causing a certain gold firm to sell on behalf of speculators, and the selling pressure intensified, once retreating to a low of 4,260 yuan. After entering, the foreign exchange turned stable, the selling pressure stopped immediately, securities firms and others turned to buying, and rebounded to 4,385 yuan, but the result closed at 4,345 yuan, 25 yuan higher than the noon close on Saturday, but 50 yuan lower than the off-exchange price on the previous day.

Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Spot Gold Rises First, Then Falls</h3>

<p>higher or lower than the off-exchange price</p>
<p>on the previous day. After the opening, foreign</p>
<p>exchange became tight, causing a sudden surge</p>
<p>in buying. Most of the brokers</p>

<p>rise. Soon, it soared by 140 yuan. A certain</p>

<p>sell, and soon it plummeted by 130 yuan. Jewelry</p>

<p>sold 30 taels to a money exchange company, at a price of 4,370 yuan. Later,</p>

<p>hearts became even more fearful. A certain</p>
<p>gold firm continued to sell, falling sharply by 110 yuan.</p>
<p>Money exchange companies did 50 taels back and forth, at a price of 4,260 yuan,</p>

<p>buying. Securities firms and money</p>
<p>exchange companies took the opportunity to absorb at low prices, and</p>
<p>soon rebounded by 125 yuan. Securities</p>
<p>firms entered 30 taels from jewelry firms, at a price of 4,385 yuan. At that time,</p>

<p>jewelry firms sold 20 taels to gold firms, for 4,345</p>
<p>yuan, as the evening closing price. As a</p>
<p>result, it rose by 65 yuan compared to the noon close on Saturday.</p>

<p>gradually intensified. Hong Kong notes and French franc notes were</p>
<p>supplied for selling, and Singapore notes, Dutch notes, and others</p>

<p>Buyers of foreign exchange temporarily wait and see - Exchange rate continues to ease, US dollar once reached 7 yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's posted prices were announced, both without ups and downs. The dark market of British and American exchanges, due to different opinions in the Japanese cabinet, and although the central bank has made concessions to Japan, it is firm on the silver case because the United States and France are involved and it is unwilling to discuss it alone. Furthermore, the situation in Europe is becoming increasingly tense. As for the Stability Plan of the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee for black market foreign exchange, rumors are still rampant, and it is said that it will once again maintain the four-pence standard. People's hearts have calmed down because of this, and buyers are also waiting and see. The process throughout the day, at the beginning, the potential was extremely stable. After nine o'clock, due to frequent settlement of accounts in the foreign firm sector, it once tended to soften, the tightest British gold was three pence four thousand sixty two five, and the softest US dollar was six yuan six two five, and it was difficult to settle at that time. However, the Chinese and Western speculators selling in front and the Hong Kong telegrams selling afterwards gradually turned the situation stable.

<p>and the forward increase one two</p>
<p>five, the New York silver price and the foreign exchange rates of the United States,</p>
<p>were all closed for business. London raw gold was fixed, and the exchange rate of</p>
<p>British to US and to France were flat, and to Shanghai, it was big one</p>
<p>eight seven five. The central bank's posted exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling prices of banks</p>
<p>for spot goods were three pence four thousand six hundred eighty-seven five for British gold and six yuan seven five for US dollars, compared</p>
<p>to the end of last week, there were no changes, after the opening, although banks such as Yinhang Youli and Hua Yinhang came to buy,</p>
<p>because outside banks such as a certain bank still had good intentions, so</p>
<p>the situation was very stable. It is estimated that Yinhang Youli bought spot British gold three pence four thousand six hundred eighty-seven five from a peer, then</p>
<p>Hua Yinhang bought spot US dollars from a certain bank for six yuan seven</p>
<p>five. When HSBC's posted price was announced, there were no changes, and the silver balance tax announcement was still exempt. After that, because the foreign firm sector of major foreign firms frequently settled accounts, and the intention of outside firms was very weak, the potential</p>
<p>gradually became tight. It is estimated that a certain foreign bank such as Huabi sold spot British gold three pence four thousand and sixty-two five to outside firms, and spot US dollars six yuan six two five, at the same time. Merchants buying a certain bank in the foreign spot US dollars six yuan six</p>
<p>five, plus this month's US dollars six yuan four</p>
<p>hundred thirty-seven five, would once be difficult to buy at the above price.</p>
<p>However, because Western businessman Sassoon sold in front, and the Hong Kong telegraph sold afterwards, the situation gradually turned</p>
<p>stable. It is estimated that Sassoon sold spot British gold to outside firms three pence four thousand six hundred eighty-seven five and a half pence, and spot US dollars six yuan seven five. Later, the Hong Kong telegram sold</p>
<p>spot British gold to favorable foreign banks such as three pence half and five thousand three hundred twelve five, and spot US dollars six yuan seven five and eight hundred twelve five.</p>
<p>It was noon at that time. Until the noon close, the selling price of banks for spot goods, British gold three pence five thousand three hundred twelve five, US dollars six yuan eight hundred seventy-five, compared to the opening in the morning, British increased zero six two five, US hardened one two five.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Still Buy in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>In the afternoon, because the Hong Kong telegrams continued to sell, and speculators also slightly sold, the market</p>
<p>became firm. It is estimated that the Hong Kong telegrams and speculators sold spot British gold</p>
<p>three pence five thousand six hundred twenty-five and spot US dollars six yuan nine hundred thirty-seven five to favorable foreign banks and others. Later, the buying price of banks had asked for British gold three pence five thousand nine hundred thirty-seven five, US dollars seven yuan. After entering, because the Japanese bank scraped together, the situation became stable. It is estimated that the Japanese bank absorbed spot British gold from outside firms three pence five thousand six hundred twenty-five and five thousand three hundred five, and bought spot US dollars six yuan nine hundred thirty-seven five from Datong. Until the evening close, the selling price of banks for spot goods, British gold three pence five thousand three hundred twelve five, US dollars six yuan eight hundred seventy-five, this month's British gold three pence four thousand five hundred thirty-one five, US dollars six yuan seven hundred eighteen seven five, the result is that the current period British are increased zero six two five and US dollars are hardened one two five.</p>

<h3>Securities: Internal Debt Hovering</h3>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>The after-hours market for securities yesterday was again unpredictable. After an initial agreement, the price dropped again by a small yuan, fluctuating continuously.</p>
<p>The price hovered within a range of one or two yuan. Both bullish and bearish factions were watching and operating within this narrow scope. Therefore, there may not be significant ups and downs in the market for the time being. The Central Bank's relaxation is gradual, gold is gradually weakening, and government bonds have also failed to rally. After the close, it was rumored that British-Japanese</p>
<p>negotiations had broken down, and there were also rumors of new loans being a possibility. Hence, the after-hours market rose by six or seven jiao.</p>
<p>News changes rapidly, leaving speculators bewildered. Therefore, the trend is likely to be one of fluctuation.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market opening was seven or eight jiao better than the previous day. The United and and retail investors bought in, but then Nos. 42 and Tian Sheng sold at high prices.</p>
<p>The market weakened immediately. Although Zhen Kang Maochun and retail investors bought in, Zhong Yi Daqing and the United and sold again, and the price still could not be sustained, dropping suddenly by one yuan.</p>
<p>The closing price was still two or three jiao to six jiao lower than the previous day. However, sentiment improved after the close, and the price rebounded by five, six, or seven jiao. The total turnover was estimated at around four to five hundred thousand yuan. A simplified table is provided below.</p>
<p>Stocks</p>
<p>Stock trading: 200 shares of the yarn and cloth exchange were traded at a price of 36.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The Public Industry Exchange opened for settlement yesterday morning and opened for trading in the afternoon. Trading time was extremely short, and the market appeared slightly weak. Transaction prices were particularly low,</p>
<p>partly because the Japanese army representative left Tokyo, British-Japanese parliamentary negotiations broke down, and the exchange rate trend relaxed slightly.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth: Yarn Market Tranquil; Transactions Based on Actual Needs; Meeting Arrangements Under Discussion</h3>
<p>Cotton</p>
<p>The spot market for cotton yarn is calm. With the extension of foreign exchange, people's minds are more settled and the market has become tranquil. As for the guild, although it has announced its closure,</p>
<p>merchants still inquire about prices via direct telephone calls before deciding on purchases. Other brokers run around contacting merchants, so there are still transactions. Therefore, all transactions are practical. The futures market has shrunk sharply. Merchants from South China and Hong Kong</p>
<p>continue to have unwavering demand, while purchases from other regions are rare.</p>
<p>Currently,</p>
<p>yarn traders gather in groups of three or five in the corridors of yarn shops in the morning, discussing market prices. According to brokers, merchants from Guangdong have some</p>
<p>interest, but their bids are very low. The asking price for 20-count Double Horse yarn is 700 yuan, but there has been a long standoff, and the holders of the goods are unwilling to sell. Subsequently, the price rebounded. It is estimated that merchants from Guangdong and Hong Kong bought about four</p>
<p>to five hundred bales. Eighty bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Haiphong on the 15th. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 3 yuan, and the price of Double Globe yarn fell by 5 yuan.</p>
<p>Afternoon</p>
<p>news: Concrete measures for the buying and selling of cotton yarn are currently under</p>
<p>negotiation separately, and it may not be easy to formally establish them for some time.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>current situation of yarn is still good. Merchants from Guangdong are still buying 20-count Double Horse yarn at a price of 725 yuan, which is</p>
<p>3 yuan higher than the morning price. However, after 3 pm, the market weakened due to the lengthening of foreign exchange rates and the decline in gold prices. According to a certain</p>
<p>runner, Zhuang Ke received a telegram from Beihai, saying to stop loading and purchasing, the reason being that the situation there is not</p>
<p>peaceful.</p>
<h3>Current Production Status</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the full-scale Sino-Japanese War,</p>
<p>Shanghai's cotton yarn market, as an isolated island, has been developing abnormally. This has led to manipulation and monopoly by hoarders and speculators, coupled with the sharp contraction of the black market for foreign exchange. The price of yarn (20-count yarn)</p>
<p>has soared from more than 400 yuan to 500 yuan, 600 yuan, and eventually to a staggering peak of 740 yuan for spot goods. This is an unprecedented record in the decades since the establishment of the yarn mill</p>
<p>business. As for actual sales, most of the Chinese yarn sold in the market</p>
<p>(yarn sales area) is no longer ours, but confined to the southwest corner, which is pitifully</p>
<p>narrow and meager compared to before the war. The current reason for the high price of yarn is artificial speculation and the turmoil created by the foreign exchange black market.</p>
<p>(Some mistakenly believe that this is due to the volatility of the Chinese currency system, but this is actually not the case.)</p>
<p>The actual sales of Chinese yarn, such as in Hong Kong, Guangzhou Bay, Kunming, and Chongqing, are only several</p>
<p>hundred bales per day, and at most, only occasionally over a thousand</p>
<p>bales. The cotton yarn speculative market in the isolated island has been suspended by an order from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, but</p>
<p>profiteers are still active in secret, although with some restraint. From now on, legitimate yarn merchants must</p>
<p>focus on actual spot trading. The current amount of spot yarn hoarded in foreign warehouses (including those held by yarn shops, hoarders, financial institutions, etc.) is no less than 100,000</p>
<p>bales. What is the current state of production of various Chinese-owned yarn mills in the special zone? This is what everyone is eager to</p>
<p>know. Our inquiry is as follows (in terms of 20-count yarn production):</p>
<p>According to the above statistics, the daily</p>
<p>(day and night) actual spindles operated by Chinese-owned yarn mills total around 370,000. The daily and nightly production of 20-count</p>
<p>yarn reaches 265,500 pounds, which, calculated at 420 pounds per bale, amounts to around 632 bales. The monthly output is about 19,000</p>
<p>bales. This is just enough to meet actual sales. With the existing inventory of about 100,000 bales in foreign warehouses, it will inevitably lead to a situation of consumption without replenishment. The inevitable result is a drastic drop in yarn prices of one to two hundred yuan</p>
<p>in the near future. Why would wealthy hoarders insist on making such a move that harms themselves, others, and consumers? (Long)</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Too High: Transactions Not Very Smooth</h3>
<p>Transactions of Chinese and foreign cotton can still be maintained,</p>
<p>but sales have slowed down because yarn prices have fallen and,</p>
<p>secondly, because the lengthening of foreign exchange rates has led to a stable mentality.</p>
<p>The market is very tranquil. China Factory and Defeng Factory</p>
<p>imported 500 bales of Zhangde cotton by post, priced at 162 yuan (cash). British Factory Ewo</p>
<p>also imported several hundred pieces of Indian cotton. Mutual buying and selling among colleagues is not as much as in the past. Attitudes have become</p>
<p>more peaceful, and market prices have also weakened slightly. 226 bales of Jitong cotton from northern Jiangsu have arrived, and</p>
<p>another 40 bales from Tianjin. The current cotton sales situation is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Another message, the foreign cotton transaction in Shanghai yesterday, due to the exchange rate lengthening, the conversion of legal tender cotton</p>
<p>prices have fallen. However, the intention of industry colleagues is quite high, temporarily</p>
<p>unwilling to sell. However, factories also think cotton</p>
<p>prices are still high, so the purchase intention is particularly loose. However,</p>
<p>given the current situation, Shanghai's inventory is relatively thin, and the exchange</p>
<p>rate will not lengthen too much, so the raw cotton sale</p>
<p>price will not plummet. But in the future, when yarn mills</p>
<p>reduce working hours and factory orders flood in, the selling price will be worrying.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices, New York cotton market, has not improved much recently, yesterday,</p>
<p>due to various parties selling and bull positions settling, the market is exhausted.</p>
<p>Coupled with the weakness of Wall Street, the market price has not been able to rise. The result is a drop of six, six, seven pounds.</p>
<p>The Indian market is quite firm, including a prediction of a one and a half rupee increase. The Egyptian cotton market is stable.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Market Prices Insufficient to Cover Costs; Factories Refuse to Open Futures; The Trend of Hoarding Also Subdued</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: The trend of speculation and hoarding in the cloth market has subsided slightly, but the market price is</p>
<p>difficult for factories to cover costs, refusing</p>
<p>to open futures. Therefore, sales prices of inventory from colleagues and factories continue to rise. Qian Ni and colored cloth each increase by three</p>
<p>to five jiao per piece, white cloth is flat. Only Ewo's 16-pound</p>
<p>Double Elephant coarse cloth is purchased by Shandong gangs in 40 to 50</p>
<p>bales, and the sales price increases by two and a half jiao. Other heavy and light pound</p>
<p>coarse cloths also increase by one jiao to two and a half jiao per piece. Guangdong gangs handle Hongzhang, Daxin, Huafeng and other factory</p>
<p>products such as thread velvet and colored twill in more than 600 cases.</p>
<p>Overseas Siamese and Singapore gangs handle bleached and dyed twill and fine cloth in 4,000</p>
<p>several hundred pieces. Wholesale shops on this street import fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, bleached and dyed cloth in two</p>
<p>hundred several pieces. The demand in Sichuan and Yunnan is very weak. The Tianjin gang in the north road, with the Tianjin case negotiating stalled, and there is also a flood,</p>
<p>no intention to purchase various goods, only to settle orders</p>
<p>procedures.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods: White fine cloth and fine twill</p>
<p>yesterday, due to ordinary actual sales, the sales price</p>
<p>has fallen back, compared to last week each piece</p>
<p>falling one jiao to two jiao and a half, 12-pound Dragon</p>
<p>Head fine cloth spot price is 18.9 yuan to 19</p>
<p>yuan, this month's asking price is 19.5 yuan,</p>
<p>next month is 20 yuan, Treasure fine twill is 16</p>
<p>yuan two jiao and a half. The Tianjin gang only has transfers, Qin</p>
<p>Huangdao has slightly added to the amount, the export trend has gradually become stagnant,</p>
<p>so the street transaction, the whole day's opening only four</p>
<p>or five hundred pieces, but colored goods, Serge, Straight tribute are relatively stable.</p>

<p>Rice: More than ten shops arrived at Hexia with Songjiang and Nangang</p>
<p>goods, nearly</p>
<p>three thousand bags of Che Lun Baozi Fengjing goods. With the arrival of goods in large quantities, and with the continuous</p>
<p>soaring of the market price, it seems it should be slightly lower, but the rice price</p>
<p>still refuses to loosen, sales are even suspended, quite</p>
<p>making ordinary residents sigh that it is difficult to buy rice.</p>
<p>It is rumored that Xi Geng opens at 28.8 yuan, Su</p>

<p>were rejected by the factory, so the Hakka offerings are still not open,</p>
<p>also heard that the back section goods station single market seven more brisk,</p>

<p>transported to Tanggu,</p>

<h3>The Root Treatment of Seminal Emission: Sexually Transmitted Diseases Specialist Doctor Zhan Nian Zeng</h3>
<p>Because we know that there are many quack</p>
<p>doctors who treat people, just perfunctorily temporarily</p>
<p>, this although adapts to the wrong psychology of the patient</p>
<p>, and fills his pockets, but other people's lives</p>
<p>are equal to my life, the patient comes seeking treatment with pain, and the doctor instead</p>
<p>plays with him treating his life like a game, how can it not</p>
<p>be a heinous crime?</p>
<p>The disease of seminal emission, although without pain, but</p>
<p>the result is ten thousand times dangerous! The world really</p>
<p>does not know how many young people are buried in the</p>
<p>painful abyss after seminal emission is not treated. Why do young</p>
<p>people have seminal emission, no more than the following</p>
<p>reasons: (1) unrestrained masturbation, (2)</p>
<p>early marriage, excessive sexual desire; (3) congenital weakness and disharmony after illness; (4) excessive use of the brain and effort, and</p>
<p>excessive sorrow, etc. Among the above reasons, the</p>
<p>reason for unrestrained masturbation is the most numerous.</p>
<p>Because this kind of hookup is most likely to damage the sex nerves,</p>
<p>making the sperm gate relaxed, and seminal emission will follow.</p>
<p>Once seminal emission occurs, a radical</p>
<p>treatment plan should be made immediately, and it must not be procrastinated. Because</p>
<p>seminal emission lasts for a long time, the function of the sperm gate will be more relaxed, and this will cause spermatorrhea.</p>
<p>There are countless cases, however, the vitality is also greatly</p>
<p>lost. Therefore, all brain decline forgetfulness, insomnia</p>
<p>palpitation, sore waist back pain, kidney atrophy premature ejaculation,</p>
<p>incomplete development, premature aging and other symptoms</p>
<p>will follow, this kind of man must look</p>
<p>withered, much pain, much disease, suffering,</p>
<p>seeking to learn, nothing achieved, the future is bleak!</p>
<p>Between men and women, and will be</p>
<p>discarded by women, hated by wives, life</p>
<p>happiness, completely lost!</p>
<p>Regarding the fundamental treatment of seminal emission,</p>
<p>daily life attention to health, such as abstinence from self</p>
<p>deception, not reading lewd books, diligent exercise,</p>
<p>often washing the local area with cold water, are all beneficial</p>
<p>, but effective drugs are also necessary. According to the world</p>
<p>famous doctor and my experience, it is believed that taking "</p>
<p>Hemitol sperm strengthening tablets" is indeed</p>
<p>effective in consolidating the sperm gate, tranquilizing the nerves, and sleeping to stop seminal emission. If seminal emission has the above symptoms</p>
<p>, it is necessary to also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "</p>
<p>Reproductive Hormone" to nourish the brain and kidneys, essence and blood and</p>
<p>nerves, continuing to take it, must be able to restore</p>
<p>to perfection in a short period of time, patients who can personally</p>
<p>come to this clinic to use the latest electrotherapy injections</p>
<p>and other therapies, can guarantee a radical cure.</p>

<h3>How to Practice Moderation in Marriage and the Harm of Indulgence</h3>
<p>Marital love is built on the foundation of sexual life, and I'm afraid no one can deny that! A man with abundant energy who marries a healthy and beautiful wife certainly does not treat her as a "vase" or idol, but warmly embraces her as the soul in his heart, the entirety of life. From the union of two lives, a new little life is born, so the loving couple's bearing sons and daughters is a natural result. However, the love between husband and wife can easily be misunderstood as indulgence; in fact, love needs moderation to grow. We know that a woman's physiology has only one sexual climax in each menstrual cycle. Although there may be a few small waves near the climax, sexual activity is absolutely not suitable before and after menstruation. As for before and after a wife's childbirth, the husband must engage in several months of moderation. If he can use his energy on his career and academics at this time, not only will his career and academics progress, but it will also be very beneficial to his body and mind! Regarding the physiology of men and women, although there are no such characteristics as women, the semen needed in sexual life is extremely precious. A man with abundant energy has as many as 200 trillion to 500 trillion sperm in one ejaculation, as well as many liquids that nourish the sperm. These substances are calcium and phosphorus, which are produced through the most advanced and complex differentiation in the body, and are the main materials for our brain, kidneys, and nerves. Therefore, any man who has committed self-pollution, night emission, or post-marital licentiousness in his early years and has exhausted his semen (i.e., reproductive gland fluid) will inevitably suffer from kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, brain weakness, insomnia, incomplete development, premature aging, and seminal thinness and infertility. This is extremely dangerous! Loving couples, they are indeed unwilling to easily give up the opportunity to enjoy themselves in a timely manner, but they must encourage each other to practice moderation in order to improve their health and ensure the eternity of their love. If they suffer from the above-mentioned symptoms due to physical weakness or youthful ignorance, they must also seek radical treatment as early as possible. Losing the ability to be sexually healthy will betray their lover and become a sinner in love. His suffering is difficult for others to understand even one ten-thousandth!</p>
<p>For the above symptoms, to seek rescue, according to the world's famous doctors' thousands of medical records and my many years of experience, taking the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone" is the most suitable and effective. This agent is made by replicating the reproductive gland hormone extracted from strong animals such as apes, orangutans, and sea dogs using scientific methods, so the quality is precious and the efficacy is reliable, which is unmatched by any pill and sperm quality preparation. After taking it, it can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves in one day and night. Continuing to take it can also promote development and adjust metabolism. The above symptoms can be completely cured in a short period of time. Regular consumption in autumn and winter can also prolong life and rejuvenate. However, those with seminal emission must also take "Hemitol Sperm Strengthening Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage, so that the treatment of both the symptoms and the root cause can achieve faster results!</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Han Yifei suffered from severe kidney atrophy and premature ejaculation after marriage, and also had seminal emission. Last month, he was introduced by a friend to be treated. I immediately adopted a treatment method that addressed both the root cause and symptoms, instructing him to purchase and take "Reproductive Hormone" and "Hemitol Sperm Strengthening Tablets" at the Zhongxi Pharmacy. In about a month, the disease was completely cured, his complexion was rosy, and his energy was abundant.</p>

<h3>Do Not Neglect the Shrinking of Breasts!</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Abundant Breasts: Boundless Happiness! Deflated Breasts: A Fateful Journey Full of Tribulations!</p>
<p>Based on physiological research and factual evidence, we have the following two very apt conclusions about the development of a woman's breasts. 1. Because a woman's breasts are well-developed, forming a high and elastic state, then her reproductive gland, the ovaries, must be exceptionally strong. Consequently, the tissues of all parts of her body are also very healthy and harmonious. Therefore, her buttocks are full, her muscles are smooth and supple, her figure is flexible, and her cheeks are like the flowers of spring. In terms of her external appearance, she has reached the ultimate in elegance and charm. Who could see her without a stirring in their heart? 2. Since the tissues of all parts are very healthy and harmonious, then her thoughts, temperament, wisdom, and judgment are all superior. In terms of studying, she easily comprehends. In terms of learning arts, (including literature, embroidery, knitting, sewing, and everything else), she also easily excels. In terms of treating people, she always greets them with a smiling face, gentle and lovely. Such women, beautiful outside and intelligent inside, are what men of the times seek but cannot find. Therefore, once married, the husband invariably loves her as a treasure. How could her happiness be limited? As for women with shrunken breasts, that is truly tragic! On the one hand, because of their weak bodies, they suffer from diseases and pain. On the other hand, because of the loss of beauty, even if they wear silk and embroidered clothes, they inevitably cannot avoid being criticized and ridiculed by discerning people. Therefore, as virgins, no one ardently pursues them, often leading to a lonely life. After marriage, the love between husband and wife is also very weak, even to the point of having no children and being abandoned by the husband! They feel lost and adrift! The only remedy is to immediately take the female "Reproductin," a preparation made from the secretions of the reproductive gland ovaries, so that they can fulfill their wishes. This preparation is made from the essence of healthy animal ovaries. Therefore, after taking it, the function of the ovaries can be nourished and supplemented day and night, promoting metabolism, regulating menstruation, and warming the uterus to stop leucorrhea. If taken continuously, it will surely make the breasts rise high and full in a short period, and the cheeks become rosy, transforming ugliness into beauty, and increasing their boundless happiness.</p>
<h3>The Root Treatment for Seminal Emission</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>Because we know that many quack doctors treat patients by merely perfunctorily going through the motions, although this caters to the erroneous mentality of the patients and fills their own pockets, other people’s lives are equal to my own. Patients come seeking treatment with pain and suffering, but the doctors play with them and treat their lives as a joke. Isn't that extremely sinful?</p>
<p>Although seminal emission causes no pain or itching, its consequences are extremely dangerous! How many young people in this world are buried in the painful abyss after seminal emission is left untreated! Why do young people have seminal emission? It is nothing more than the following reasons: (1) excessive masturbation; (2) early marriage and indulgence in sex; (3) congenital weakness and imbalance after illness; (4) excessive use of the brain and excessive sorrow, etc. Among the above reasons, excessive masturbation is the most common cause. Because this kind of behavior most easily damages the sexual nerves and relaxes the seminal valves, seminal emission then arises.</p>
<p>Once seminal emission occurs, a fundamental treatment plan should be made, and procrastination should never be allowed. Because with prolonged seminal emission, the function of the seminal valves will inevitably become particularly relaxed, resulting in spermatorrhea. However, the vitality is also greatly depleted. Therefore, symptoms such as brain weakness and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, kidney atrophy and premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and premature aging follow one after another. Such men will inevitably look haggard, suffer from pain and illness, endure hardship, and achieve nothing in their studies and careers. Their future is bleak! In relations between men and women, they will be rejected by women and hated by their wives. The happiness of life will be completely lost!</p>
<p>Regarding the fundamental treatment of seminal emission, attention to daily life and health, such as abstaining from self-pollution, not reading obscene books and paintings, exercising diligently, and regularly washing the local area with cold water, are all beneficial, but effective drugs are also necessary. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking "Simituo's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" is indeed effective in consolidating the seminal valves, calming the nerves, promoting sleep, and stopping seminal emission. If the above-mentioned symptoms have already occurred due to seminal emission, then it is also necessary to take the reproductive gland preparation "Reproductin" to nourish the brain and kidneys, essence and blood, and nerves. With continued use, it will surely be possible to restore perfect health in a short period. If patients can come to this clinic in person to receive the latest therapies such as electrotherapy injections, a fundamental cure can be guaranteed.</p>

<h3>New Value of Electrotherapy in Treating Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>In the past decade, there has been a leap forward in the treatment of gonorrhea, and in terms of physical therapy, there has been significant progress. Taking electrotherapy in physical therapy as an example, initially, wavelengths were used. Later, it was discovered that long-wave electrotherapy could not exert its sterilization characteristics in certain situations. Therefore, further research and improvements were made, and short waves were invented. In terms of application and sterilization efficiency, it is indeed beyond the reach of long waves. However, there are still shortcomings in certain situations, and long waves still have advantages. Therefore, long- and short-wave electrotherapy complement each other in the treatment of gonorrhea and cannot be neglected. However, there are many shortcomings in both, which cannot be listed. Therefore, the progress of electrical equipment itself is increasingly evident through the tireless and meticulous research of general scholars. Generally speaking, the electrotherapy used by general physicians is mostly outdated and insufficient to meet our ideal sterilization effect. Therefore, the general superficial and ignorant people generally deny it, which is too much. Because the most ideal electrotherapy—filtered laminar electrotherapy—has now been invented.</p>
<p>Filtered laminar electrotherapy is the latest invention in the German electrotherapy community. Its penetration and sterilization power are just right, without the drawbacks of being excessive or insufficient. It can thoroughly eliminate gonococci in the local area of acute and chronic gonorrhea. Therefore, all major venereal disease hospitals in Europe and the United States are equipped with filtered laminar electrotherapy machines. Since the invention of filtered laminar electrotherapy, electrotherapy has been re-evaluated in the treatment of gonorrhea. Based on my experience of more than ten years, filtered laminar electrotherapy is the best in electrotherapy. If the condition can be carefully observed and supplemented with symptomatic therapy, such as prostate massage for prostatitis and Xi's serum for arthritis, a radical cure can be guaranteed within a limited time. Because filtered electrotherapy can sterilize and filter out gonorrhea toxins, and serum can eliminate gonococci in the blood.</p>

<h3>Two "Sitting" from "Law" to "Literature"</h3>
<p>— Qing Hou</p>
<p>Perhaps because I like miscellaneous things, I sometimes always read books other than the specialized books of so-called "literati," and I especially love to browse through our consistently available law books. The reason for that is not because I want to get a doctorate in law, but because I want to study the intention of "legislation," and I want to study how a certain "law" makes it easy for people to "play with the law."</p>
<p>In fact, what I am researching is still the tricks of the "literati." Because our so-called "Legalists" throughout history have been fundamentally inseparable from the literati. The "law" established by the Legalists is, in essence, meant to deal with the common people. The reason why literati rarely "break the law" is because they "know the law," and it is precisely because they "know the law" that they can "play with the law," and finally use the "law" to cover up their own "lawlessness." -- Of course, there are also those who "make a law and are killed by it themselves."</p>
<p>I feel that in our consistently available "law," the most powerful are "collective liability" and "reciprocal accusation."</p>
<p>According to the "Records of the Grand Historian," "collective liability" was invented by the ancestor of the Legalists, Shang Yang. Later, it was also called "green liability," which is already very common in the "Tang Law Subcommentaries." In short, it is to arrest and prosecute or behead the fathers, sons, brothers, and younger brothers of the criminal. In the consistently available "law," it seems that only the "relatives" are encircled by "liability," and the oldest "Tang Law" still has the words "non-cohabitants" for "relatives," but in fact, it is often not the case. Once "collective liability" arises, not only the "non-cohabitant" relatives of the criminal will be dragged in, but also non-relatives, and even people who are completely irrelevant. The "melon vine search" of the Ming Dynasty was like this, and the literary inquisition of the Qing Dynasty also used this "law." This is indeed extremely enjoyable for the executor.</p>
<p>I don't know who invented "reciprocal accusation," I only know that it already existed in the oldest "Tang Law." According to the consistently available express provisions, it is naturally reasonable: to make another person subject to criminal punishment, and the crime is not established, you must become a criminal yourself. The "Tang Law" says, "Those who falsely accuse people will all be reciprocally accused." But this is just express wording on paper, and the facts later are often not the case. Often the plaintiff is not "falsely accusing," but will be "falsely" accused of "falsely accusing." At this time, the trick of "playing with the law" appears. And often something was done by the defendant, but the defendant can put that thing on the plaintiff in the same way. -- This trick is what is said in the past petitions, "retaliation," which is considered the most terrible trick.</p>
<p>These are all "old laws." Although I have not studied the "new laws," I have heard that "collective liability" has been abolished. As for "reciprocal accusation," it probably exists, but it is said that the malpractices are less, but I still don't quite understand how it is.</p>
<p>But although some have been abolished, and some of the malpractices have become less, the remaining power of these two kinds of "laws" can still be found in the society of "literati." I have also researched this a little bit.</p>
<p>For example, if a literati's nose is hit, he angrily pushes his own "characteristics" to the other party, the style is: "You say I am reactionary, but in fact you are reactionary!" -- This is the application of the reciprocal accusation method. For example, if a literati's nose is hit, he curses all the people around the person who hit him, even if those people have nothing to do with his perceived enemy, he just insists that they are all the same faction. -- This is the application of the collective liability method. If the two "sitting" are used together, it will be even more powerful, so the literati thinks that he has won.</p>
<p>The literati has not yet mastered the "literature," and first learned this trick, so it is better not to say it. Just looking at the "law" of these two old methods, if it is completely applied to "literature," in my opinion, it is difficult to be sure of a real victory. To really "play with the law" is not an easy task: to evolve reciprocal accusation into retaliation, it is also necessary to create some evidence of retaliation. If you only learn the shrew-like tone of "You say I am stealing a man, but in fact you are stealing a man," it is always difficult to convince people. Even if you are blushing, you can only make people feel funny. The application of the collective liability method is even more difficult: because the literati at this time is not the executor of the "law" after all, and since he cannot actually investigate, he can only rely on the method of smelling. However, this is going to cause problems, either mistaking two people for one person, or mistaking an outsider for an insider. Although you think it is extremely enjoyable, in fact, it can only make people feel funny.</p>
<p>The two "sitting" do not work, the old "law" is difficult to "play with," the literati's jumping is ineffective, and it is really the era that makes it so.</p>
<p>However, it can also be interpreted in another way. Hasn't the newspaper ever published that a certain party is implementing collective liability? At the same time, hasn't the newspaper also told us that under the "law" of a certain party, people are often punished for "false accusation"? Then, our literati can also be said to be catering to the spirit of the "new era."</p>
<h3>Three Eggs</h3>
<p>— Lin Quan</p>
<p>At noon, the sun rose to the top of my head, and the hot wind swept up the dust from the ground; among the forests, the dense leaves drooped wearily. The mountains squatted like sleepy old men.</p>
<p>I was walking alone on the field ridges. My legs were very sore, my head was a little dizzy, and the military bag on my arm became heavier.</p>
<p>The village in front, the roosters crowed at noon. The yellow dirt road stretched endlessly forward.</p>
<p>The village was just ahead. Looking at the trees and thatched huts at the entrance of the village, I supported my tired body and walked forward with more effort. My mouth was so dry that it was about to crack, and my eyes were blurring.</p>
<p>"Female soldier! Female soldier! New Fourth Army!... "</p>
<p>By a small river at the entrance of the village, the children stopped their water games and pointed and shouted at me.</p>
<p>An old woman was sitting on the threshold of a thatched hut, picking broad beans, and a flock of chicks were pecking at the broad bean shells next to her feet.</p>
<p>"Old grandma! Picking beans!"</p>
<p>I went over and greeted her.</p>
<p>"Picking beans! Ah! 'Comrade,' you've worked hard? Where are you from?"</p>
<p>The old woman was very kind and cheerful. Her clean salt-cloth jacket had patches, and a pair of red embroidered slippers on her small feet looked like two pairs of dazzling red water chestnuts.</p>
<p>"My brother is also in your unit! My brother Li Tianfu, he's called Li Tianfu!"</p>
<p>The children also gathered around. A small pockmarked face, a little unnatural but very proud, raised his eyebrows high and said to me. The other children stared at him with envious eyes, and the roots of the little scab's ears turned red.</p>
<p>"His brother went to your team last winter, he insisted on going himself! Your team is really good, this old grandma! "</p>
<p>The old woman supplemented the words of the little scab, and then pulled me to rest in the house, there was another guest in the house.</p>
<p>"Your comrades can do work! The reasoning is really good! The farmers' resistance association there in ×× shop has set up a cooperative, it's easy to borrow money, otherwise, in this time of year between crops... "</p>
<p>The guest was the director of the Farmers' Resistance Association of ×× shop. The work there was being talked about with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Don't let that female comrade leave! The noodles are in the pot!"</p>
<p>The old woman shouted in the kitchen, I don't know when she went in again.</p>
<p>"Old grandma! How can this work? I've eaten on the way, and I have to hurry... "</p>
<p>I declined, feeling very uneasy. I stood up and wanted to leave, but the guest pulled me back.</p>
<p>"There's nothing to eat in the countryside, just a little noodles. It's still ten miles to ×× shop! "</p>
<p>So I had to sit down full of unease.</p>
<p>The noodles were brought up, they were boiled in plain water. There were a few spots of oil and a few leaves of green vegetables floating on top.</p>
<p>"This is really embarrassing! Really shouldn't... "</p>
<p>What's embarrassing, you yourselves say that the army of the people is one family! - Last year, many of your comrades came here, and also built a stage for opera! Don't look at me being old and useless, I understand what your comrades say... Eat! Come outside to eat, there's wind, it's cooler. How can you walk with your stomach full?... "</p>
<p>The old woman gave a large bowl of noodles to the guest, and a small bowl to me. The noodles were steaming, scalding hot. I turned the noodles with my chopsticks, and when all the noodles were picked up, suddenly, I noticed that there were three eggs hidden under the noodles! I immediately guessed sensitively what was going on, so I looked up at the guest's bowl opposite, he was also picking up the noodles and turning them, but there was nothing at the bottom of the bowl.</p>
<p>"It's really hot, let's blow some wind!"</p>
<p>I said unnaturally, and sat on the threshold with the bowl. There was some wind outside, and the vast fields stretched out. The children jumped into the water to catch fish, and the chicks were still pecking at the broad bean shells by the ash heap. A pair of old yellow dogs lay down in the dense shade of the elm tree. Everything was gentle and quiet. I looked down again at the three eggs in the bowl...</p>
<p>In my heart, excitement and joy made me jump up. Turning my head back, I met the old woman's kind and sincere gaze, and a burst of burning sensation climbed onto my cheeks. I knew my face must be red.</p>

<p>Bumping against the wall of the car.</p>

<h3>Picture</h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>In quiet, peaceful years, who doesn't have fantasies and reveries? The harmonious realm woven by music tubes and keys, don't you admire it? I prefer to use the colorful brush of fantasy to depict the images of the soul.</p>
<p>Now, it is a different mood, quite thinking of drawing a few comic strips:</p>
<p>The crows carry the setting sun, one by one returning to the forest, the village bathed in the red light is quiet and beautiful.</p>
<p>Iron crows track and come. Circling and circling again.</p>
<p>Boom, boom... lulululu...</p>
<p>The soil turned over, and flesh and blood irrigated the land. (The seeds of resentment are sown, and the children of the earth will take revenge.)</p>
<p>The setting sun may be unbearable to witness, and falls down sadly. The fire burns fiercely, reflecting half the sky red; it counts as a substitute for it.</p>
<p>The iron crow goes back whistling "victory."</p>
<p>Cries, calls, and moans burst the brain of the universe. The moon painfully reveals its pale face, sighing as it looks at the suffering earth.</p>
<p>But the living are angry.</p>
<p>"Go to the mountains." "Pull them out." The loud roar echoes from the wilderness to the wilderness. Arms are raised like a forest.</p>
<p>The wilderness is boiling.</p>

<p>Entertainment World</p>
<h3>Entertainment Programs at the New York World's Fair</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>In addition to displaying various commodities and artworks, the New York World's Fair also offers all kinds of entertainment. Here are some special programs:</p>
<p>(1) Wireless Film: Wireless film is becoming a reality in the United States this year. At the New York World's Fair, not only is a wireless film screening room being set up, but also various scenes from the fairground are being captured by wireless film and broadcast to countries around the world. Therefore, the situation of the fairground can also be seen in wireless films in European countries.</p>
<p>(2) Electric Puppets: There is an American puppet show expert named Oona Walff, whose puppet show does not use hand-operated strings but uses electric strings, which is also a new invention. Recently, his full electric puppet troupe also performed publicly at the New York World's Fair, and the performances were all famous world-renowned operas, which were generally well received.</p>
<p>(3) Nude Performance: Nude performance is a very stimulating entertainment at the New York World's Fair. Beforehand, some people vehemently opposed this kind of performance, but in the end it was still performed publicly. And there were several scenes that were completely nude. The performers were all healthy and beautiful girls. In addition to the ordinary programs, there was also a nude swimming performance, which was very exciting.</p>
<p>(4) Beauty Exhibition: A Paradise Park has been built in the New York World's Fair, and for the need of some beauties to decorate it, a selection was made in the western United States beforehand, and as many as eleven Hollywood beauty stars were selected. These women are all on display in Paradise Park, like a beauty exhibition.</p>
<p>(5) Grand Premiere: The blockbuster film "New Gold Mountain," which was recently shown at the Grand Light Cinema, was shown worldwide for the first time at the New York World's Fair not long ago, and the ceremony was quite grand. On the first night, only officials and diplomats from various countries were allowed to visit. Because the story depicts the scenery of Australia, the Australian consul in New York also visited that night. From the second night onwards, it was open to the public, and anyone could go and appreciate it. From then on, it was sold out for several days in a row.</p>
<p>(6) Other: In addition to the various kinds mentioned above, all kinds of dramas, operas, music, as well as circuses, acrobatics, etc., that are popular in the United States, are almost all collected at this New York World's Fair. Therefore, it takes at least a few weeks for a tourist to see all these entertainments!</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese War Documentary "Blood Splattered Baoshan City" Premieres in Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Hui Cun</p>
<p>—Received unanimous praise from public opinion</p>
<p>After leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong, the famous director Situ Huimin collaborated with Cai Chusheng to produce a "Blood Splattered Baoshan City." The story tells that Battalion Commander Yao Ziqing of the Ninety-eighth Division led more than 600 brothers to defend Baoshan City to the death until it was lost. All of the more than 600 brothers in the entire battalion, except for one who left the city to ask for help, all died. The plot is tragic and fierce, both lamentable and praiseworthy. The film and the "China Electric" production "Orphan City Bloodshed," which was released before moving to Chongqing, are based on the same material and have the same effect. However, the plot is slightly different. The film stars the hard-line young actor Li Qing and Chen Yunshang, and was completed last year. It was immediately shown in Hong Kong and was praised by the audience and praised by various newspapers.</p>
<p>Now, the film has been transferred to Chongqing and is being shown at the Unique Cinema. In recent days, the box office has been very good, and audiences are crowding in, making it difficult for the theater to cope. There is no other way but to extend the screening period, so the film is still being shown. (Note: There are several cinemas in Chongqing with relatively perfect equipment, including "Guotai," "Xinchuan," and "Unique." Since the Japanese aircraft attacked Chongqing, "Guotai" was burned down and "Xinchuan" was bombed. Now, the only remaining one is "Unique" (it is truly unique). The area of the theater is not very large, and part of it has been opened up as a refugee shelter, so the scope is even smaller. When the film "Defend the Homeland" was shown last time, the audience was extremely crowded. When the excellent national defense film "Blood Splattered Baoshan City" was opened, the box office success should also be no exception.</p>
<h3>Beiping Theater News: Updating the Stage and Inviting Famous Actors</h3>
<p>— Yan Yan</p>
<p>First Group Changed to Wu Suqiu, Gou Huisheng Will Take Over Afterwards</p>
<p>Shanghai's Updating Stage sent Zheng Zibao and Du Juchu from the Ju Chu Society to Beiping to invite actors. They are quite active and, after much negotiation, have now made headway. In addition to Wu Suqiu, Zhao Xiaolan, and Li Shixiu, three female actors, having been secured for the ribbon-cutting and opening ceremony on the first day, the full cast has also been finalized. The veteran actor (male) is Chen Shaolin, the martial actor is Liang Huichao (currently performing with Lü Huijun at the Tianjin Grand Theater), the female actor is Wei Lianfang, the supporting veteran actor is Zhang Chunyan, the old female actor is Li Duokui, the comedian is Sun Shengwu, and the painted face actor is yet to be determined. Among them, the young male actor is the most sought after, and it is the famous Yu Zhenfei.</p>
<p>The above full cast is scheduled to depart on the 28th of this month, at the latest by the end of the month. However, Zhao Xiaolan's departure may be earlier. As for the opening date of Updating Stage, it is confirmed to be September 10th. On the first day, Wu, Zhao, and Li will jointly perform a fine play, the title of which is yet to be determined, but it will be either "Dragon and Phoenix Bring Prosperity" or "The Four or Five Flower Caves." Afterwards, Wu Suqiu will perform solo. It is said that the people of Shanghai have high expectations for Wu.</p>
<p>Xun Huisheng has indeed been successfully invited by Updating Stage, but the date may be delayed. Xun has not performed in Shanghai for a long time, mainly due to seasickness. This time, Zheng Zibao and Du Juchu came north with a handwritten letter from Zhang Xiaolin. Zhang and Xun have a teacher-student relationship, so Xun cannot refuse. Xun's departure is scheduled for mid-next month.</p>
<p>Following Wu and Xun, Li Wanchun, Tan Fuying, and others will come in succession. However, recently, both Golden Stage and Updating Stage have sent people to invite actors, and negotiations with famous actors are frequent, so news is diverging. The final decision is difficult to generalize at this time. However, the above news is all reliable, so it is described in detail above, which should be welcome news for the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Random Notes of Artists</p>
<h3>"Chen Charles' Confession" (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xu Xinyuan</p>
<p>— Thoughts on Filming Detective Movies</p>
<p>Editor's Introduction: Mr. Xu Xinyuan is a veteran of the silver screen, and his reputation has long been established. Because he was born with an extraordinary physique and is also very experienced in acting, his portrayals of warlords, bureaucrats, and large-bellied merchants are lifelike and show his spirit. Speaking of the silver screen's veteran actor type, since Shang Guanwu passed away in his later years, everyone pushes him as the leading figure, worthy of the name, and not a false reputation. Recently, he played the role of detective "Chinese Chen Charles," creating a new path for domestic films, with many excellent achievements. This article focuses on this, and elaborates on detective dramas, which is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Who to act as a detective for, I have heard people say this, but I have not experienced it myself. I thought it was the same as acting, the same expression, what's so difficult? How could I know that when I joined the Xinhua Company to film "Chen Charles Returns to China," the first detective case "The Pearl Shirt," I already felt that it was indeed not easy. We actors, no matter what role we play, whether it is a bureaucrat, a politician, a wealthy merchant, or a local tyrant, there is always a model standard. As long as we grasp the personality of the character in the play, of course, we can play whoever we resemble, at least with some certainty. Only when playing the role of a detective, in fact, Chinese society lacks such a person, and it is simply impossible to imitate. It is even more difficult to play "Chen Charles." Although Warner Oland, who plays Chen Charles in the United States, has had many films shown in China, his plot and actions are completely Westernized, and mostly different from our customs. For example, there are many newly invented scientific and medical machines in the play, which are not only rare in China, but even if there are any, it is difficult to do because filming is limited by capital. As for Warner Oland's slow expression and lack of spirit, Chen Charles should not have this typical characteristic. It is all foreigners deliberately exaggerating when playing Chinese people, so my actions in the "Pearl Shirt" play do not completely imitate Warner Oland, and Director Xu Xinfu also instructed me not to be too lacking in spirit, to take his strengths and discard his weaknesses. When the film was successfully shot and publicly screened, the audience's comments were: some said the appearance was very similar, but the expression and actions were too slow; some said the movements were delayed, very much like Chen Charles' posture. This made me feel caught in a dilemma, not knowing what to do, which really made the actors suffer.</p>
<h3>Silver Screen News</h3>

<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muxue</p>
<p>The Long-Legged General is Busy Hanging and Splitting Plaques at the Private Party</p>
<p>Those who attended the grand event that day, in addition to Chen, included Mr. Li Wei'wu, who once served as the commander-in-chief of the Restoration Army, as well as Wu Guangxin and Pan Xinhang. At that time, everyone saw their affectionate situation and felt that in this day of war and turmoil, if the Zhili faction generals were to retaliate, the Xuzhou relationship would be extremely important. Zhang and Chen already had a sworn brotherhood, and Chen came in person to express his goodwill, it seemed that in times of emergency, Chen would be able to give Zhang friendly assistance. Who knew that not long after, Zhejiang Governor Sun Chuanfang, in the name of autumn exercises, defeated the Feng army in Shanghai, Ningbo, Bengbu, and Suzhou with lightning speed. At that time, Chen Xuexuan had already ceded the Anhui governorship to Jiang Chao-liu, but because of the alliance brother's recommendation to Zhang Shao-shuai (Hanqing), he was still able to station his old subordinates in Bengbu, Suzhou, and other places in some capacity. When Xing Shilian and Yang Yuting successively lost Shanghai and Ningbo and fled north in embarrassment, they never expected to suddenly encounter Chen Xuexuan's head-on attack between Bengbu and Suzhou. Such a sudden encounter battle not only made it impossible for Yang, Xing, and others to fight, but even Anhui Governor Jiang Dengxuan had to suddenly leave Anhui and flee to Xuzhou due to the influence of the illness at his side. At this time, Zhang Zongchang, upon hearing that Chen Diaoyuan had suddenly changed and secretly colluded with Sun Xinyuan to attack their Feng army and himself, immediately fell to the ground in his Xuzhou headquarters like a "stiff zombie." When he regained consciousness, he repeatedly scolded himself for being a bastard and not recognizing people. If he had known he would be like this today, he would have solved him together when the Feng army launched a major southward offensive, to avoid today's major harm. As he was saying this, he suddenly looked up and saw the birthday plaque that had just been hung up not long ago was still hanging high in the central hall, the upper and lower inscriptions written so affectionately. Reflecting on today's situation of disregarding faith and suddenly becoming enemies, the long-legged general ordered his subordinates to move the plaque off the ground, and with a knife in his hand, he chopped and split the lower inscription, cursing incessantly, revealing his crude bandit nature. He did not stop chopping until his hand was sore and the knife was broken, and the ground was covered with pieces of wood. After a short time, he ordered people to carry it to the yard, set it on fire, and then felt a little better in his heart. — (August 1) —</p>
