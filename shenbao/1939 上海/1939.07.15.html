<h3>論安定物價</h3>
<p>自物價飛漲，研討之者亦衆矣，以無裨於物價之平準；固知徒言不足以濟事，要亦居今而談安定物價，不得其時，不得其地，而亦不得其人者也。何以言之：蓋今日戰時也，戰時之經濟，幣値失其準，生產失其常，運輸失其便，則物價安得而不變。所處之地淪陷區也，地旣淪陷，情有非常；子輿氏有言，天下烏乎定，定於一；今則環境複雜，不安定有甚於物價者，乃求物價安定，不亦難哉！以言其人，濟濟多士也，但物價升降之因果錯綜，孰能就全盤而統籌之，孰能就盈虛而調劑之，孰能就低昂而平準之，孰得而切實管理之；縱有妙手，何能回春，縱有雄才，難展懷抱，此上海物價所以終於卼臲不安也。</p>
<p>何况物價貴賤之觀感，隨各人處境而各殊。一則日常生活基礎不同也，米麥布疋油鹽蔬菜之昂，在生活寬裕之輩不敵其雪茄香檳汽油花粉漲價之爲痛癢相關也。舞塲一擲之資，夠平民一月之糧矣，故一般方爲生活艱難皇皇不可終日者，彼固無動於中。再則嗜好有所不同也，麥食者與穀食者殊，肉食者與素食者殊，其同情之心彼此隔閡，若夫生活程皮高下懸殊，其感想也自異，蓋惟有同嗜者而後有同感。有同感者方有同情也。三則幣値觀念之不同也，如一石之米價，用英幣計之，數先零而已，戔戔何足道；美金一圓爲細數，詎知足敷中國難民兩月之糧；若以半鎊一圓合之中國貨幣，則其數量所予人之觀念，非復戔戔細數矣。四則利害關係之不同也，在大多數之消費者，蘄求物價之平落，而在操縱居奇者，正惟恐物價之不漲，函人惟恐傷仁，矢人惟恐不塲仁，用心正復如是耳。五則經商目光之不同也，如米價不高至二十一元以上，洋米何能進口，及米價扶搖直上，即有巨額洋米成交矣。此可知各有所私，而所謂物價問題，固因人而異其觀感，相去或如霄壤者也。物價之升漲，如直綫之上騰，故不論時機之遲早，要在有資力，無往而不利操左券耳！循是而致之結果，富者愈富，貧者愈貧；財富將集中於少數人。有爲富者慶，慶固宜也，然危機亦何可設想；蓋如今日之物價，長此中風疾走，勢必引起社會之不安，多數之多數，至食不飽，衣不給，試稍作冥想，將復成何境界耶？固如是也，則其所擁有之財貨，又有何價値之可言？例如內地淪陷之區，物產積滯，此在歐美爲黃金，今在內地如糞土；動輒橫征暴歛，得不償失；儲則徒資魚肉，呼籲無門；物價低落極矣，顧好現象耶！於是知所謂物價問題者，關聯之方面至多，有未易言者也。</p>
<p>雖然，就事論事，我人不能無責於金融界。蓋不有金融界利用其資金，活躍於商品市塲，彼交易無如是其盛；不有金融界出高折扣接受投機囤積之貨物，彼周轉無如是其靈。孰能家存白米數千石？則有行莊倉庫；孰能腰纏現鈔百千萬？則有行莊往來。即如外匯套息，匯劃貼現，資金逃避，黃金飛漲。何一而非金融界與有直接間接關係者也。國民節省其汗血之資，存儲於金融業，金融業者不應以發展生產，扶助正當工商業爲正常使命耶？顧乃識見短淺，誤認囤積居奇之商品，爲押款放款之唯一好對象者，此此然也。袖長善舞，以周轉爲挹注，於是助長投機之風；待價而沽，從容觀變，試問市價安得不漲？夫爲一行一莊計之，利潤豐厚，趨之若騖，蔚爲風氣；然以整個金融業之使命言之，以金融業所托庇之整個社會民生言之，吾人不能不厚望於金融界賢明之士，勸導同業而亟相糾正。洵若是，物價騰貴所造因於金融業之部分，必得漸歸平準；此雖不足以使物價全部趨於安定，然造福社會民生，必已大有可觀也。</p>

<h3>英日談判前夕　東京舉行反英運動　日比谷公園舉行羣眾大會　列隊遊行向英大使館示威</h3>
<p>（東京）今日日比谷公園舉行反英民眾大會、參加者者五萬人、會後有民眾約一萬五千人手持反英標語之旗幟、以音樂隊為導、向英大使館進發、日本時報指日本反對任何外國之示威游行、以此次為最大、下午一時半示威者行抵英大使館、見大門已閉、並有日本警察五百餘人排列三行、實行保護、時有暴烈份子約四千人、紛紛以磚石及上有反英標語之旗幟、擲入大使館院內、屢圖侵入、並向煽動羣眾衝入使館之演說者、高聲歡呼、惟為警察所阻、不能如願、警察曾兩次以摩托自行車阻止羣眾衝破大門之企圖、示威者多數着退伍軍人會之軍裝布外衣、並有穿海軍制服之領袖一人、警察初僅設法防止衝入使館、一刻鐘後、乃不得不勸令示威者散去、至於英大使館人員、此時仍照常辦公、亳無驚擾之象、今日反英大會所通過之決議案、其中有痛斥英國為公理及人道之仇敵、東京縣市議會議員一百四十人、分為五組、分訪平沼首相·有田外相·海陸兩相·及英大使克萊琪、面遞上項決議、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　外相有田以內閣所贊向之英日談判中根本政策、奏知日皇後、昨夜召集外務省上級人員舉行四小時半之會議、對於英日談判中或可發生之種種局勢加以討論、目前全國注意集中於有田與英大使克萊琪間之初步談話、此項談話大約在星期六日午前舉行、朝日新聞評論此初步談話謂、如英方未有改變其遠東政策之誠意的表一示、則解决次要問題即天津事件之努力定歸失敗云、聞談話時將用英日兩種語言、目前英大使館人員方積極工作、以期應付其所將遭遇之重大壓力、今晨有日人代表團三起至英大使館遞交對於英國東亞政策之抗議、午後日比谷公園舉行民眾大會後、游行赴英大使館大使館等秘書白萊恩今日接見日代表五人、彼等以東京市民七百萬人之名義、呈遞一冗長决議案、要求英國將其租界交還中國而退出遠東、外務省發言人今日在招待新聞記者時聲稱、外務省巳請英大使克萊琪明日午前到外相官邸與有田相見、俾在舉行關於天津時局之正式會議以前、作初步談話云、發言人對於初步談話之詳細內客不允宣布、僅謂報紙消息純係猜測之詞、某記者以英日會議之决定對於華北日軍是否有束縛效力相詢、發言人答稱、此次談判係兩國政府所舉行者、或詢以華北一臨時政府」受此决定之束縛否、發言人答稱、「臨時政府」與此談判無關云、發言人又答復某記者之問話、謂全國各處民衆反英大會純係自動的發生云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>英日談判　前途黑黯</h3>
<p>（倫敦）此間對於東京英日會議之開幕日期、尙未接獲正式情報、官塲人士對於英國向日本抗議青島反英運動之可能性、均守緘默、惟一般印象則以為英國將以此項反英暴動所及於東京會議之影響警告日政府、每日民聲報載稱、若日本對英國提出之要求、誠如日本半官消息所云、則此次談判自始即陷於黑暗云、每日捷報謂日本對華之戰事已失敗矣、如吾人拒絕在華與之合作、日本自不致有對英作戰之問題、倘日本冒險為之、則吾人可毀其經濟結構、惟日本不致推進其要求至此地步云（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>美國當局　密切注視</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）此間外交界對於遍佈日本全國之反英運動、極為注意、認為完全由日本政府所發動、蓋日本政府對國會尙能控制、焉有對於此等活動、即乏按制能力也、故外交界咸認此次英日談判必無好結果、換言之、英日會議失敗之後、則在遠東方面之外人一般利益、顯然皆趨於惡化、故此間認因時局之惡化、美國參院頓行政變其態度、而傾向於採取畢德門禁輸軍火與九國公約破壞者之建議、亦未可知、（十四日美聯電）</p>

<h3>滿洲是日本的重累</h3>
<p>— 伯明</p>
<p>下文著者，署名Guzo　Hakwaisba，大約出於假託，於日本攫佔滿洲後，未獲微利，反增重累，實為軍閥所鑄大錯之一，闡述甚詳，且用數字證明其論據，非空泛發論可此，由此可知這次軍閥對華作戰，正蹈前覆轍，該文載見本期密勒氏評論報，爰予迻譯，想為關心時局者所樂閱也。</p>
<p>譯者</p>
<p>日本的經濟枯竭巳漸降臨了，它的原因，不僅由於目前在中國長城以南作戰，並且由於日本軍閥統治滿洲，而遭遇日增無已的重大擔負所致。當一九三七年七月，對華戰爭發生時，日本已因消耗在滿洲的經費而感到窘困，已往六年中，每年耗費將近五萬萬日元。一那些用在鐵路和各種工業上的經費，列為「投資」，其實這只可欺騙愚人，所造的鐵路，大都乃供軍略上之用，常和現有的路機平行，付出的股息很少，或竟不付。就多數的鐵路說，大致是、永不會獲利了，除非在賬目上用些手段，使虧折看來像盈餘。但這些鐵路能使日軍從這區運到他區，永遠不斷的對中國游擊隊作戰，朝鮮北部的幾個新港口，是供日軍自日本本部急速運出之用的。</p>
<p>鐵路不但供軍略上之用，以對付中國，並且在需要時可供對付蘇聯，日本軍閥對於蘇聯，表面上勇敢地虛張聲勢，和妄自尊大，暗地裏却非常恐懼。自去年大受驚駭，被按迫將張鼓峯讓給蘇聯後，日本軍閥更加惶恐，為免被泰西列强和華人看輕起見，他們迫不得已而維持挑　的態度，這不過是一句空話，因為他們却審愼地避免挑起眞正的戰爭。邊界事件」已發生了數十起，假使軍閥眞要戰爭，每起都可供他們藉口發作，然而日本軍閥確然不要對蘇作戰，總算日本幸運，蘇聯也不欲從事對日直接大規模的戰事。</p>
<h3>蘇日開始摩擦</h3>
<p>不過，這種和蘇聯的摩擦，却是日本最不幸的事情重的結果。對蘇關係的日趨惡化，是日本軍閥最愚蠢的舉動。一九二五年蘇日條約成立以後若干年內，兩政府間有極友好的關係，在一九二五到二七年，和一九二九年到三一年間的日本文治政府之下，蘇日的友誼最為顯著，但軍閥也遵行友好的政策。當一九二九年奉天政府圖從蘇聯攫取中東鐵路時，南滿鐵道拒不准許華方用它的鐵路綫和車輛運送軍隊對抗蘇聯，一九三二年初，日軍和滿洲軍開始激戰時，蘇聯准許日方利用中東路，報答前情。陸相荒本贊成和蘇聯作密切的友好諒解，國民同盟即安達謙藏的軍事法西斯黨，公開主張蘇日新同盟，日軍和蘇軍問友好的交換官佐，也非一日，直至一九三八年，才告終止</p>
<p>一九三三年，日本謀攫中東鐵路，破壞了以前的對蘇友好關係，這眞是愚蠢的企圖，這也是日軍侵佔滿洲，因而跋扈驕橫的直接結果。還在那時以前，實在已有若干日本軍閥和外交家過激地詆責蘇聯，而不時危害蘇日的友好關係，他們當然假託日本是遠東「反赤化主義的屏障」，使泰西魯鈍的保守黨發生良好的印象，而對日本軍閥的侵略，給予援助。在西方，希特勒就用和此相同的假託，而得到保守黨的援助。（未完）</p>

<h3>存款外商銀行　經濟家力闢其謬　如購買外滙尤爲不智　投資內地係正當辦法</h3>
<p>重慶十三日電、自天津租界問題發生、日僞爲欲達到預期之陰謀目的、不惜造作種種謠言、以搖動華民衆心理、一般無識者難免不爲所愚、以致上海方面、發生提取存款、競購外匯情事、財政當局爲安定滬市金融起見、特規定限制提存辦法、自此項辦法施行後、上海金融市塲、已趨穩定、惟聞間有少數存戶、尙未切實明瞭國家及自身利害、仍有提款轉存外商銀行之舉、記者昨遇某經濟專家、叩其意見、承發表如下之談話、</p>
<p>投機份子　妄造謠言</p>
<p>查上海一埠、早已造成爲全國金融及商業之中心、中外士商雲集、各業貿易繁盛、投機份子潛伏其間、在平時亦常妄造謠言、希圖牟利、固不僅投機外匯一項、衡以滬市數十年之歷史、受資本家及投機家造謠操縱之害者、已不勝枚舉、况近來日僞份子、飛揚滬市、造謠伎倆、無所不用其極、其用心不僅在搗亂中國之金融、直欲摧毀中外正當商業、國人不察、爲其所愚、殊堪惋惜、</p>
<p>法幣鞏固　外滙穩定</p>
<p>但中國法幣穩固、絕不致爲造謠搗亂者所破壞、雖或一時稍受影響、亦正如雲霧之蔽日月、頃刻間風消雲散、日月光明、耶如管理外匯、原爲戰時國家應有之辦法、而中國政府對於正當需要、一經核准者、仍按照法定價格一先令二便士又四分之一照數售給、並不以投機市價之低落而有變更、中國法幣價値之固定、於此可見、再查中國發行制度關係、六成現金凖備、四成保證準備、現金準備成數之高、爲世界各國之冠、</p>
<p>準備實況　超過日本</p>
<p>雖以採購抗戰必需品及維持市面關係、其現金準備項下之外匯頭寸、不免稍有入超、而由政府購物、外輸出口商售結外匯、以及收集金銀、吸收僑匯、並與英美迭决借款等外匯準備、業經先後充實遞增、現在準備實况、據種種方面考證、決不在一般國家貨幣準備之下、允遠超過日本準備之上、是洗幣之信用、與其他各國法幣之比較、其實力之厚薄、已彰彰明矣、故對於一般懷疑法幣與競購外滙之民衆、必係不明世界經濟之大勢、而誤入歧途、以自减其保障、誠堪惋惜也、</p>
<p>外商銀行　不盡可恃</p>
<p>中國一部份民衆、以敎育程度之低落、對於世界一般經濟狀況、往往疏於審察故於判斷力及自信力二者、均極欠缺、認爲外國銀行必定可靠、其實就國際情形過去歷史而論、存款於外國銀行、確屬害多利少、先就利息一項而言、外商銀行利息微薄、有時反須繳付手續費、至於安全問題查歐戰之時各國經濟、均極恐慌、銀行之倒閉、日必數起、即號世界最富之美國、亦會因經濟恐慌、致有多數銀行倒閉、現在世界大局緊張、戰機迫於眉睫、萬一不幸爆發、各該國對於銀行資金、或有種種管理之辦法、屆時試問何能提款、求全反損、悔將無及、况引諸往例、在華外商銀行之倒閉停業者、亦數見不鮮、受害之國人、爲欲得獲全、反而落空、此點願吾人嚴爲審察者也、</p>
<p>本國銀行　信用卓著</p>
<p>幷就存款本國銀行之利益、的略言之、本保障個人利益、增加抗戰力量之原則、國人資金、自以存儲本國銀行爲最得計、查中國銀行事業、雖發創較遲、然以政府當局審查之嚴密、幣制之穩固、國家銀行維護之得當、銀行本身、對於營業方面、因層層之監督、運用不得不格外穩健、利息方面、本國人互助之精神、亦較外商銀行爲優厚、且民衆隨時均能注意、明瞭其實况、存款自易臻安全、抗戰兩週年來、賴財政當局之調度有方、中國幣制之實力充足、不但社會金融、穩定如常、國家經濟、屹無動搖、且絲毫未曾牽及民衆之利益、而對於存戶之保障、允能竭其最大之努力、</p>
<p>購買外滙　最爲不智</p>
<p>目下一般淺識民衆、竟以信用鞏固之法幣、購買外匯、無端受損、大爲可惜、不知政府對於正當需要之外匯、始終仍照法定價格供給、只要理由正當、隨時均可購得也、今竟有人以實値一先令二便士又四分之一之法幣、在市易換六便士餘之外匯、旣冤枉减少其八便士之資力、叉復喪失其優厚之利息、不智之事、無過於此矣、况外匯市價、動盪不定、隨時均有變化、回憶過去二十年內、英金一磅、曾折合中國幣七元餘、美金一元、曾折合中國幤九角餘、現在世界大局危急、此種往事、實有再現之可能、凡我同胞鑒往知來、何必橫遭此項損失、此本人不得不就所見、以爲忠吿者也、</p>
<p>投資內地　可獲厚利</p>
<p>再者、現在日人封鎖口岸、後方生產建設事業、驟然勃興、民族資本運用、機會極好、如能投資於內地生產事業、不但於個人可獲厚利、而使整個金融活潑、其對國家民族之貢獻、不亞於前方將士也、現在抗戰已到最後關頭、民族生存、與最後勝利之途徑、已行其大半、我全國同胞、應如何完成此偉大之任務、奠定此安居樂業之基礎、實極重耍、本人以經濟學之立塲着眼、盼全國人民對移存外商銀行及購買外匯兩項之損失與危險性、所謂不敢緘默、爲不厭煩瑣、略進一言、以爲同胞之忠吿云云</p>
<h3>周家嘴島　外僑財產蕩然無存　日方只允償還一部份損失　僅及原有財產價値之什三</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、前居周家嘴島之外僑、因彼等在該島之財產、遭日軍攫取與摧毀、仍望日方賠償、最近續行會議、考慮日方所提供之償還一部份損失、聞僑居該島之若干德人、已接受僅及其損失的一部份之賠款、但其他衆人不致如是、日方之提供、不包括動產在內、而各種賠償要求中、以動產價値爲最巨、數外僑確見兵用卡車運走動產、僑居該島外人之平房中一切物件、包括冰箱汽車在內、悉遭日兵攫走、未被携去者、則遭搗毀、日方之提供、亦未包括船隻、其中一艘、昔爲公共租界工部局之救火船者、近有人見已被日軍作廢船利用之、戰事爆發時、僑居該島之外人頗衆、建有美麗平房與茅舍、足敷寄居、比較言之、此等房屋建造所費不巨、財產之有價値部份、乃爲裝飾傢俱與個人物品等、電流旣通、備有冰箱與無綫電等者頗衆、且個人物品、均安置平房中、聞目前日方之提供、僅爲遭基沒收與利用之「不動產」、而非前年十月間被攫走之各物、外僑要求之賠價、乃以金鎊計算、按照目前匯率日方之提供、僅及財產價値之什三、查外僑係前年八月十七與十八日左右退出該島、旋有設法返島取出少許物件者、發現彼等之財產尙無恙、然自十月初起、外僑見日本軍用卡車三輛、在軍官）員指揮下、載運刦得之傢俱與個人物品、並確認自己之財產亦被運去、或以此事詰諸日軍官者、則答曰、渠任其部下稍有不愼行動、頗爲抱歉、日後將從嚴約束云、嗣後、駐滬英軍司令司馬萊特少將佈置使外僑往該島一行、已獲得此間日本陸海軍當局簽字之通行證、但外僑一行、計汽車五十輛、駛至定海路橋、竟遭日軍代理下士一名攔阻、某外僑車抵該地稍早、設法駛過日哨兵、而抵其平房、見日兵兩名、方用槍刺破其箱篋當該外僑之面盡取箱中所有、復向該外僑恭然鞠躬而去、俄有日軍巡邏兵一名、將該外僑逮捕、押至大陸、拘留一小時有半、决定其非危險份子、乃將其送回平房、比返、該外僑發現其汽車已於其被扣時失竊矣、本年中、日方准許該島外僑一羣前往視察彼等之財產、見該島呈悲慘景象、平房破損不堪、絕無完整奢、所遺惟紙片與私人照相等物而已、某外僑之戰時指揮力及勳章、亦吿喪失、聞日方曾一度推託外僑動產係華人運去者、然外僑明知一切確爲日本陸軍所爲、惟當時外僑决計離島、是報領署、提出要求、對一切財產按照十四便士之英鎊匯兌率全部賠償、</p>

<h3>遠期外匯又在緊縮</h3>
<p>— 用中</p>
<p>無論進口外滙申請，出口外滙結售，對於上海外洒市塲，是不會發生效力的。所以最近報上說進口外滙也不供給，出口外滙聽其自便；但是黑滙市塲上期現買賣，沒有限制的說法，直接間接仍會影響到外滙基金，導是不可吾認的事實，本報已屢言之。最近扒進期滙的日多，即使外滙頭寸雄厚非凡，涓涓不塞，將成江河，亦必有垂盡之一日。可是英國人在國會內屢是這般表示，維持中國的法幣，而不念中國外滙的洩漏，都從英美銀行的手內流出去。假使中國外滙沒有保全的辦法，固亦無所謂維持中國法幣，這是因果必然之理。如今是正在加緊吸收中國外滙了，中國方面亦似乎防範加密了，而昨日遠期外滙叉在緊縮了，此爲暫時的或是恒久的，叉是吾中國政府不供給的關係，在事實未判明前，無從下定語。但是英美商人如果決心鞏固中國金融，維持中國法幣，確有將上海黑滙市塲自由買賣及無限制供給；加以澈底收束或改革的必要；期滙買賣，能從緊縮而至於停止，現貨買賣的範圍，能逐漸收束，一步一步的做去，於中國外滙的消耗，必有多少的挽回。或以爲如此辦法，妨碍洋商貿易，而不知此正是保全中國對洋商貿易永久的利益起見。蓋保存中國目前所不需支出之外滙，即爲將來對外貿易發展之基礎；與其將可貴的外滙，流入於一人手中，何如保存滋息，以爲將來各方運用，所以不但要停止期滙，即代爲出面買賣外滙，亦應該停手，莫爲人作嫁衣裳，自貽伊戚，想英美商人愚不至此，然而英美商人至今是畏首畏尾，不肯下決心。</p>
<h3>金融　外銀行供給淡薄　外匯遠期見新低　現貨掉八月拔開愈遠　套利月息達六分左右</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、悉無變動、英美匯暗市、初時現貨潛勢極平、後因洋行結款較繁、且外行對於美匯賣意稍淡、故略見帶軟、但英金幸賴匯豐銀行、供給尙殷、致得以維持、站定原價、而七八月期貨因沙遜續來力扒、加以外行賣意極淡、而吃胃殊佳、致市勢步緊、入後再以市上突傳聞國內有某公更動謠言甚熾、故愈將人心激動、是以一般中西投機商不辨分明、競相猛扒、加以香港亦來電大扒、致緊勢愈厲、大有祇縮不回之勢、八月份出現遠月空前最緊價、先令巳退至六便士關邊、爲六便士〇六二五、美金已破入十二元大關內、創見十一元七八一二五故掉期更形拔開、七月與八月英金距離二八一二五、美匯相差五六二五、的合月息（除佣）竟有四分五厘强、現貨與八月、英金差縮半便士、美金達一元、月息已增至六分左右、但銀行無貼出實、且華商更不敢落手、故套利者絕少、至港匯因洋行等扒意頗濃、故複破入四十四元關內、結果軋緊二五、</p>
<p>沙遜港方均在結進</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近期長二五、遠期升三一二五、紐的銀價未更、倫敦生金仍無變動、匯兌英對美大三毫、對滬·對法均平、美對英·對滬·對法亦均無變更、中央掛牌各匯如舊、（已停止申請）、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金六便士五六二五、美匯十二元七八一二五、較之前收均無榮辱、開後洋行界相繼扒進匯豐等各外銀行與某美行現貨英金六便士五六二五、及現貨美匯十二元七八一二五、市勢穩定、迨匯豐掛脾揭曉、悉無更改、及白銀平衡稅揭曉、依然免微、時外行對於期貨納胃頗健、而供意殊淡、非貴價不願說售、故潛勢步軟、計某行曾吸進外商本月份美匯十二元六二五、此後沙遜力扒美行本月份美匯僅十二元五六二五、並八月份美匯祇十二元一五六二五及一二五，同時英金本月份亦緊至六便士四三七五、八月份亦軟至六便士一二八七五、但英行匯豐等對於以上價、仍無供意、時已午刻、洋行會吸進外行安達現貨港匯價仍四十四元一二五、爲狀乏變、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英美匯均與晨開無異、</p>
<p>美匯八月進十二元</p>
<p>後市因洋行結款較多、但匯豐對於英金、尙肯維持、故市勢遂呈英平美略帶軟、計洋行結進匯豐現貨英金六便士五六二五、叉購結美行現貨美滙十二元七五、其時市上因國內某種謠言熾盛故人心頓昂、中西投機家傾向期貨方面扒結、兼港電亦突來傾扒、且外行賣胃艱難、致情况愈形緊軟、計港電與沙遜及華商投機家等相繼扒進外商銀行本月份英金由六便士四〇六二五、步軟至三四三七五、並本月份美匯由十二元四三七五、步緊至三七五、後又結進英行八月份英金六便士一二五、八月美金破入十二元關、最軟喊過十一元七八一二五空前緊價、入後港匯亦因受洋行與錢兌業等猛扒、且外行供意極淡、是以市勢頗緊、破入四十四元關內、據聞外行賣價、已軟至四十三元八七五、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金六便士五六二五、美滙十二元七五、本月份英金六便士三四三七五、美滙十二元三七五、八月份英金六便士〇六二五、美滙十一元八一二五、結果較隔昨、現貨英平美軟〇三一二五、本月份英緊一二五、美軟二五、八月份英縮一八七五、美貴三七五、港匯照最後價軋過、亦緊二五、茲將一天做開交易錄後、</p>
<h3>空穴來風　現金又向高峯推進　衝出二千六百三十元大關　交易轉旺共達九百兩光景</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、初時市勢極平、雖有某銀號（代外行）與香港帮相繼吸收、兼銀樓帮亦有納胃、但以現金號供意殊濃、致不爲所動、盤旋於二千六百元左右、入後不意塲中突有某部易人之謠傳、且同時外滙期貨猛緊、故激動買風、一般投機商競相力吸不已、加以賣方供意驟淡、致漲風頓熾、竟接連打破二千六百十元至二千六百三十元三重大關、一度曾昂達二千六百三十一元高峯、惟結果則猛漲三十元、全天交易尙旺、共達九百兩光景、銀樓飾金步高三元、海關金與中英純金等依然呆定、</p>
<p>烚赤竟軋漲三十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因某外行即委託某銀號前來吸收、兼錢兌業代散戶亦起購買、市勢堅挺、開市做高二元、錢兌業進現金號五十兩、價二千六百零二元時、買風雖强、無如現金號賣意殷濃、潛勢略挫、瞬息稍回一元、某現金號力塞予某銀號百兩、價均零一元、嗣又挫一元、金號賣予某銀樓（代港帮）五十兩、及現余號售予某錢兌業五十兩、價均六百元、繼而金號復進證券帮五十兩、價零一元、後相同價某銀樓又代港帮吸收現金號共五十兩、其時某銀號亦再代外行吸納錢兌業五十兩、價六百元、後銀樓帮相繼吸進現金號共六十兩、及錢兌業三十兩、價均與上相同、午刻撳低二元、現金號賣予銀樓帮五十兩、爲五百九十八元、作午收價、午後初開尙平、首由錢兌業賣予金號五十兩、價仍五百九十八元、繼而金號又進錢兌業五十兩、價六百元、時某銀號錢兌業力進、漲勢漸銳、金號售予錢兌業五十兩爲六百零四元、詎至二點二十五分、忽有不利之空氣傳來、更聞外滙英平美緊、期貨一致大縮、人心激昂一時缺少賣戶、市塲中好事者、突來狂購濫拖、致漲風驟厲、市勢混亂、竟於買風籠罩下、猛抬二十一元、始有銀樓帮賣予金號五十兩、價一十五元，俄叉躍起三元、錢兌業進金號三十兩、價二十八元、後再抬高四元、衝出三十元關口、錢兌業互做三十兩、價三十二元爲當日高峯、後回小二元、錢兌業叉互做五十兩、二千六百三十元爲晚收價、結果較上日軋漲三十元、查已連漲五天、共計五十三元、全天三十四元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價二千六百四十元、收進二千六百二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、據詢均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金掛大紋銀改低</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初未更動、迨至九時四十分掛大一元、（同時大同行紋銀兌出價則减低三角、改懸二元五角）、午後二時四十五分因烚赤猛漲、故又掛高二元、計大同行改懸二百六十六元、新同行爲二百六十四元、收進二百五十八元、</p>
<p>中英純金依然呆定</p>
<p>十三日倫敎電、英純金每盎斯仍呆定於七鎊八先令六辦士、致中央銀行之各行市價亦均呆而不動、計中國純金收買價仍爲一千二百十二元三角、掛牌海關金爲二元三角九分六厘、上海標準標金便亦仍爲一千二百零七元六角、</p>
<h3>貼現續昂　拆息不動</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、續稍高昂、每千元上午之貼價、爲九十三四元、下午步高至最後爲九十四元二角半、比前日續高七角半、至錢業公會拆息仍未更、早午兩市均掛一角八分云、</p>
<h3>外幣仍昂　多數上漲</h3>
<p>昨日英純金與英美滙兌俱未更動、本埠外滙、洋行結款甚殷、洋商吸納頗力、外銀行供給尙暢、市價英平美緊、英美金鎊、供給未暢、且烚赤高漲、市價堅俏、英美金票、需要甚殷、滙票遠期甚緊、市價高抬愈烈、香港票法郎票新加坡票等需要俱殷、且皆奇貨可居、市况堅昂、多數上升、日金票供給較暢、晚市爲九角九分五厘、朝鮮票需要薄弱、市况疲弱、晚市爲八角六分五厘、公會交易稀、鎭興出隆昌進美金票五百元、新泰出隆昌進美金票一千元、昨日市價、英美金鎊各升五角、英金票升一角五分、美金票升八分、香港票升八厘、法郎票升一厘、新加坡票坎拿大票各升三分、荷蘭票斐律濱票各升一分、羅比票升二分、澳金票升一角、安南票義大利票德金票暹邏票未更、</p>
<h3>證劵　外債續跌　內債稍振</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况繼續趨漲數角、惟爲狀已屬堅中帶軟、報載財政部通吿此次本息改在渝貼現付給在上海及各埠仍分六個月付給、現鈔、或匯劃後、叉云財政部正式命令尙未到滬、此種傳聞不正確之消息、早在本報本有聞必錄之原則發表在前、聞係多方欲思出籠、乃利用宣傳辦法、森動市面、不料市塲人心轉因此而懷疑、蓋多方以爲兩日來已漲起兩元、甲種六十元關、丙種五十元關、均不能穿出、故又漸漸出籠、故出此辦法耳、總之此决發息之成爲謎、正爲發言含渾、故欲使人於混水中摸魚也、如初開時協大震康福康等買進丙種、會至九元一角、甲種曾至六十元邊際、但五號十號大豐聯和賣出甚湧、市價退落半元、入後散戶尙有需要、而松茂同康天生恒孚等號、亦有吐出、趨勢乃成强弩之末、故結果祇續漲四角半至七角半、成交總數的計四五十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票市况、南洋姻草股成交五十股價八元二角、衆業公所股市略有問詢、怡和股共計成交四千六百股、收盤買價十八元二角及賣價十八元叫角、墾殖股共成交三千股、收盤買價爲五元九角五分、電話股續堅挺、收盤買價十二元三角、及賣價十二元五角、各項橡皮股統計成交一萬五千股、價格均照市、公司債券市面、電力五厘半公債成交三萬二千元、價在八十一元半及八十二元之間、工部局六厘公債成交一萬兩、價九十四兩、電話六厘公債及花旗總會七厘公債、均有少數成交、</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠東各公司股票本月十三（週四）掛牌行市、除麥加利銀行股上升二先令六便士、價爲七鎊五先令外、其餘均無變動、</p>

<h3>糧食　米價續跌　已不在小數　但限價仍舊</h3>
<p>杜粳　國米市在此週內一蹶不振、向下直瀉後、高特貨以目光相別、已暴落二元有奇、而中宿者貶跌尤慘、竟達三元左右、此種米情、惟囤戶悲心、蓋一般囤積者、素以獲利爲主、對於民食問題、本非所懷、茲經嚴限米價、旣無利可圖、遂都袖手、而同時將前所囤積者、耶求急脫、避免虧蝕、人心一餒、不的而同繼以風潮、途决水漬之貨、互相推售、乃市上籌碼頓較往常增多三倍、而銷塲則反呆木、致市面日跌一日、愈降愈烈、遂造成此一落千丈之勢、昨則銷塲允呆、經售者一味猛傾、祇謀出胃、故其市况更頹、結果厚薄粳售價、再小三四角、變元無交易、查河下來貨計到松江帮兩船車輪包子二千餘包、全市成交僅四千餘石、</p>
<p>客秈　昨日本客去化均呆、而存底旣充、來源絡繹、隨在行囤客販競脫之下、行情立見慘跌、高貨尙能扳住十六元、較前市小三四角、而中關以下與宿决各貨、乏人問津、則降跌有五六角至七八角之鉅、惟價跌後本街去化略活、內地鄉莊亦略有找補、全日開出二千多包、啊部局之限價、已定下週一减一元、秈尖最高價爲十六元、</p>
<p>洋米　連日擯持之際、更以秈米已見一再慘落、昨現西貢在客秈狂瀉下售出一百多包、價祗廿一元半、比前開廿三元之價較小一元半之鉅、蓋目下客秈旣見充斥、而前定洋米亦已啟裝、現洋米勢難再度站立云、</p>
<h3>糧食　麵粉回籠貨　售價依然暗鬆　本麥疲莫能興</h3>
<p>現粉廠盤、站定如故、查客路交易、除零星點綴外、迄無整批去路可言、蓋目下銀根頗緊、滙劃貼現高昂、故有一部份客戶、均注意於滙劃售價之回籠貨、聞市上回籠貨、依然暗鬆、價在五元以內之滙劃者、但非正式之市面、蓋廠方以目下停機减車後、生產已見减少、在此產銷兩稀聲中、亦不願過於遷就云、</p>
<p>麥市趨勢、步見鬆落、近日新到各貨、絡繹不絕、去路僅恃日廠微有採辦而已、聞日商前有裝運出口者、今亦停辦、而華廠則以洋麥原料尙充、對於本麥竟置之不問、故市面處此環境、一時疲莫能興、昨日市塲供給不多、執貨者大都上棧待機、不願出樣、僅山日廠添辦南京小麥三百餘包、價由六元五角再鬆至叫角三分、兩天中已跌去一角五六分云、</p>

<h3>紗花　港滇帮辦胃不衰　紗價已連漲三日　布廠減工者日夥　獲利者不乏吐出</h3>
<p>紗市上漲雖緩、然連漲已有三日、實則港滇兩帮採辦粗細紗繼續不懈、港帮再買六百六十包、雲南帮進二百三十包、共計八百九十包、其他帮口仍受交通封閉影響、不能運輸、遂告停頓、至於同行方面、因銀錢業限制放款、及透支活動力量、大受打擊、因之近日成交實際生意占多數、市面基礎、鞏固之由來也、不過有十部份之意見、對於以後市價變動範圍在二十元之間盤旋也、近來棉布交易、十分呆滯、白坯貨價不穩、一般小模型之布廠、减工停工業已實行、與紗市當有密切關係也、</p>
<p>現紗情形晨初開盤、市塲議論一致看好、因廣西雲南方面需要接踵而來、人心提升、開價即漲二三元、二十支雙馬現貨價爲四百八十六元半、棧單貨價爲四百八十一元、旋以人氣緊俏、同時客銷不弱、市價步開步漲、雙馬外棧價至四百九十一、棧單曾到四百八十四元、迨至收盤獲利者吐出、略見回挫二三元、雙馬外棧價跌爲四百八十八元、查半日成交統計一千四百八十包、行情二十支雙馬漲四元、牧羊平、特金城漲四元、十支粗紗漲四元、英商怡和廠開出二十支收羊二千包、價爲三百九十一一元、五福五百包、價爲三百八十五元、一個月出淸、永安廠開出二十支特金城五十包、價爲五百零五元、今日出口棉紗有一千件運天津、二千七百五十件運香港、三百十件運北海、五百八十五件運海防、茲將各帮買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>日紗市面續見昂升、但實需仍屬平常、且布廠受出路不暢之影響、减工者日夥、棉紗需要允淸也、二十支月琴現出價爲三百八十九元至九十元光景云、</p>
<h3>無力贖抵押棉花　只得將紗作質</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日又轉靜寂、各業均抱觀望態度、靜候農部之與各大棉商討論津貼問題之發展、七月期之了結、引起市價下沉、昨日印度連同預測不動、埃及跌十磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日外滙違期又吿緊縮、殊使交易更趨困難銀行界方面對於原棉糧續拒做押款、紗廠方面有棉押於銀行倉庫者、因無軟取贖、祇可將紗運往、以易原棉之用、由此可見廠方之處境困難矣、</p>

<h3>太古增闢暹邏航綫</h3>
<p>— 蘇</p>
<p>從上海至暹邏，原無直達航錢，凡欲赴暹者，均須由滬乘船至港轉搭太古公司輪船前往，最近該公司鑒於赴暹之客貨運日形增加，故定增闢滬暹航錢，並已於月之十一日由該公司之蘇州輪駛往，中途計停靠香港，安南之土倫（Tourane），西貢（Saigon）而達暹邏之盤谷（Bangkak），全程計需十六日可畢。嗣後該公司將於每星期派輪駛暹一决，由上海至土倫及西貢之大菜間票價，爲港幣一百三十五元，官艙國幣一百四十元，房艙一百零八元，吊舖七十九元，統艙五十六元。赴曼谷之大菜間票價爲港幣一百五十元，官艙國幣一百八十二元，房艙一百四十一元，吊舖一百零四元，統艙七十三元。</p>
<p>西貢爲安南之南京，更爲安南對外貿易之耍埠，越南國有鐵路在此起點，距離北京河內，一千七百五十公里，土倫則位於西貢與河內之間，亦在該鐵路錢上，客貨如欲由上述二埠轉往我國內地者，可由上述二埠，循鐵路直接至越南之邊境同登，再過即係我國之桂省，亦頗便利也。凡國人入境或取道者均須備具護照，經法領署簽證後方可成行。</p>
<p>盤谷爲暹邏國都，當鐵路中心，水陸交通均便，商界繁盛，我國僑民旅居該市者達三十萬人，操縱全市商業，以是國人往返該埠者亦夥。凡赴暹者均須備具我國政府機關所出具之護照，經暹邏領事，簽准方可成行（查上海並無暹邏領事香港則有之）同時於抵暹時須繳納登岸保證金暹幣二百五十鉢（的合國幣八百七十餘元），如持有暹邏當局准許重行入境之證明書者，可以免繳，該項保證金，將於相當時期後發還，又於登岸時除須繳騐此間工部局衛生處所出具之牛痘及防疫證書外，另須受該當局所派之醫官之眼疾檢騐，如凡息有沙眼者，一概不允登岸。</p>
<h3>越南政府將　更改外僑入境辦法</h3>
<p>— 洵</p>
<p>凡國人之入越南境者，均須備具出國護照，經法領署簽准後，才准入境，依照法領署定章，請求加簽入境簽署，應付簽字費七十五佛郎，並於抵越後繳付居留稅。（一年越幣十六元，半年十二元，三個月八元）。</p>
<p>前由報載，自本年七月一日起，法越政府將限制外僑入境，於每人入境時，應繳越幣一百元，並增加居留證費之消息，頃向駐越南河內我國總領事署探查。據稱法越政府確有此意，唯增加數目不致如傳聞之多，現正由領館與法越當局交涉，何日實行及如何增加，尙未决定。至於經過越南而赴我國內地者，則不在此例，僅需於請求法領加蓋過境簽署時交具經濟保證書則可，如該領署認爲該保證書不合格時，則須由請求人繳付保證金越幣一百元，該款於日後出越境時可以領回。</p>
<h3>赴美游學之手續（二）</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>治裝問題</p>
<p>一·衣飾　凡是到美國去讀書或游學的人，對於其衣飾是相當重要，蓋身在國外，一人所代表的並不祇個人，而常被人看作一個國家和民族的代表，一般不相識的人每以外表作標準，所以對於衣飾一項，雖可不必十分考究，「整潔」二字是不可太忽略的。美國學生對於他們的穿簷有時很隨便，看各地各校的習慣而不同，我國學生當然可以從俗，不過總要在水凖綫以上，免受他邦人士譏笑。現在把赴美前對於衣飾的準備分男女略述如下：</p>
<p>男　赴美的男同學，雖然全穿西裝，但用本國綢緞所製的中裝也不妨帶一套來，可以在宴會時穿，並可代作常禮服。普通西裝最好在國內作好帶去，每套最好作兩條褲子比蛟方便。至於顏色，厚薄，套數等等：要看各人在美居留的久暫，地區的氣候及各人選擇而定，不能有固定的標準。質料要堅實耐久不易改樣，我國國產呢絨所製的西裝，質料與歐美相倣，穿起來亦可以自豪呢，美國北部氣候是寒，耐寒衣服更須準備，夏季衣服在美國無論南北均所必需。襯衫可山國內製就帶去，式樣要連領單袖口，可免洗頸與換袖扣的麻煩，顏色以白色爲宜，絲綢衫少帶爲妙，因洗費太昂，且易破壞，此外領帶，鞋帽，襪，雨衣，睡衣，內衣等，可視需要酌量携帶。</p>
<p>女　女同學出國服裝，最好是「抱自足政策」，在美的我國女同學，多半是穿本國衣服，一則是習慣，二則中國衣服和西裝並沒有特別不同之處，同時西裝的樣子常有變更且赴各式宴會的禮服亦各有講究，非初赴美的學生所能熟悉的，唯一避免的辦法是穿中裝，反正美國人士對此亦挑不出錯來，衣服以夾單衣爲主，最多做幾件襯薄絨的，因爲美國無論何地，室內的溫度總是很高，材料以絕對「國貨」爲主，不僅提倡國貨，一方面也寓有宣揚國粹的意義。凡赴宴會穿的衣服最好要精緻一些，如有些繡花則更佳，要備牠幾件，普通的衣服以絲綢爲上，因爲絲綢在美國認爲奢侈品，在本國則並不算貴，西裝的衣服在國內做好帶去比較便宜得多，且國內西裝裁縫的工藝還算不錯，料子最好用國產呢絨。至於大衣在美國是少不掉的，皮大衣在美國看作很奢侈的物品，在國內却不算怎樣的，衣以反皮爲宜，預備一二件帶去是很用得着的。春秋大衣可以在美國購置，其價錢不會十分貴的。絲襪則以在美購置爲宜，因爲其織法和絲質的細非國貨所能媲美，價錢一元美金左右可以買到很好的絲襪，普通的數角即已不錯。</p>
<p>二·其他用品　美國各處旅館房舍全備有臥具，可以不必帶往，氈毯也無需，毛巾浴巾普通多半備有，買時亦不貴，其他如本國之國旗，地圖，字典，及文具等常然不可少，此外最好能帶些中國文化材料及美術品，如繪畫，照片，繡品，雕刻以及其他小陳列品，不但可以送人作禮物，更可作宜傳中國文化。出版品有關一般情形及各種紀錄的也極有用，茶葉如携帶不出五磅可以免稅，送人最好用靑茶，美國人喜花香，不十分在乎茶味的好壞。凡到中國學生較少的地方，交際比較多，講演機會也不少，各種東西都用得着，反之中國學生多的地方交際比較少，大家不覺中國人稀奇，來往也比較少一些，擅長中國音樂的更不妨帶些樂器樂譜去，有時可以演奏。衣箱可帶一“Steamer　Trunk”及手提箱，各種都有國貨可購，但不可圖便宜，萬一半途損壞殊不値得，如果在美打算多旅行可以買一掛衣服的箱子，否則可不必。</p>

<p>輪船</p>
<p>一，渣華公司由滬赴厦港票價，曾一度改收英鎊，現該公司各輪船之二三四等客票仍按國幣發售，僅將原訂國幣票價加收二成而已，至於頭等客票則以港幣升算，其由滬至香港之頭等票價爲港幣一百十元二等國幣一百十元，三等七十五元四等四十五元。</p>
<p>二，太古公司增闢暹邏航綫，其詳情已誌本刊，恕不贅述。</p>

<h3>法人對爐敎華文</h3>
<p>中國古代有竺道生，入虎丘山，聚石爲徒，講湼槃經。不意法國有一名士，名茹連者，對火爐敎授華文，亦可謂無獨有偶矣。茹連頗達中國文字，其所繙書，不勝枚舉。嗣在一大學院舉爲敎誦華文之師。照各師之規則，必時常在院內，於招客之前，傳誦華文之奧旨。當其初充是任時，訂於每禮拜四日升台宜講中學，時歷月餘，而來聽者竟闐無一人，惟有空堂中相對之火爐，日與爲伍。茹連仍滔一滔不絕口，一若堂中聽衆，濟濟蹌蹌，不勝擁擠者。夫火爐聽講，豈可望其沾益乎。某日，忽有鮮衣美服士女多名，皆列坐而環視，茹連喜出望外，以爲從此後中國文學將有振興之望矣。於是茹連見巾幗圍繞其前，索性慷慨而談，以娛其意。乃以林和靖詩一首，內將巾　比爲杭地之梅花者，譯出而啟講焉。姿態活發，言詞娓娓，較對空堂中之火爐時，更爲有聲有色。聽購者見其如此神情，無不興高采烈，臨去時猶喜笑雀躍也！至下一講期，來客又多，內尙有初决所來一士人，茹連見之甚喜，暗自謂於此將得一篤信之弟子乎。彼繼續講學一季，而此士每决照期率士女以來，不缺一課，賽爲最忠誠之弟子無疑。迨季滿，或告茹連曰：「此人爲法京之引路者。旅客遊巴黎，欲鑒賞名勝奇異，先生對爐講學，亦列入奇異中，故彼率遊客來聽也。而先生講說神情，洛外抖擻，遊客認爲確是奇異之一，故頗滿意云。」</p>

<h3>如果阿Q生在現在</h3>
<p>— 許幸之</p>
<p>這成為中國文化學之紀念碑，而轟動世界文壇的魯迅先生的「阿Q正傳」，不僅是一個畸零人的人物的傳記，而是一幅破落的中國農村生活的畫圖。牠不但反映了當時辛亥革命的時代背景，并且　寫了封建制度的沒落，農村經濟的崩潰，以及資本主義侵入農村的社會病徵。</p>
<p>魯迅先生用他那鑽刀似的生花的筆，木刻似的彫琢的文字，把阿Q及其周圍的「羣鬼」，刻畫得淋漓盡致。雖然，是一篇粗綫條的散文，然而，作為一個畫家的我看來，却是一幅古今希有的生動的「素描」。</p>
<p>可惜，我不是彫刻家，不能把牠彫出立體的阿Q羣像來；也更不是一個考古學者，深深地去探尋阿Q的家世。因為，我是一個愛好戲劇的戲劇工作者，我想把「平面的」阿Q，變為立體的阿Q，把文字的阿Q，變做活生生地用演員來扮裝的阿Q。因此，我這使「阿Q正傳」搬上舞台的火一般的熱情，雖遭遇過重重的障礙，但誰也不能阻撓我而使我的熱情消冷。</p>
<p>儘管有人說，阿Q的時候早已過去，但是阿Q及其周圍的「羣鬼」，并未在中國的農村中完全滅亡。封建地主的罪孽的渣滓，買辦階級的欺榨的逆跡，和貪官污吏的醜惡的殘餘，仍舊在現中國的城市和農村中橫行無忌，並且，多方阻撓着抗戰和革命。凡是某方的勢力到達的地方，往往就是他們套上了愧儡的衣冠，袍笏而登塲。</p>
<p>倘使有人問：阿Q如果生在今日該當怎樣？這問題，曾在我的腦中考慮過多時，最後，我相信阿Q生在今日，並不至於充當「漢　」。因為，做「漢　」要有「漢　」的條件，阿Q並不能勝任。</p>
<p>再則，他雖然認識不清，但他對於土豪劣紳，貪官污吏，買辦及其主人，却懷着深惡而痛絕之心。縱然，他並沒有明白表示要和他們作堅决的鬥爭，但也不曾表示過要向他們的黑暗勢力投降。</p>
<p>並且，在他那低能的腦海中，時常浮起對於「革命」的憧憬，『革命了，革命了，革這夥媽媽的命，太可惡！太可恨！』這正是從他心坎中喊出來的正義的呼聲。這種呼聲，我認為比他那『兒子打老子』的精神勝利法格外堅強。</p>
<p>如果，阿Q生在今日，我相信，他也許會在酒醉酩酊之後，乘火打刦地跟流氓地痞們接接東西。也許會聽信謠言和恐怖，會跟一羣老弱的難民們一齊逃難。也許他會在土榖祠中呼喊起『造反！造反！』而幫助遊擊隊做做短工。這要看當地的抗戰的情緒如何，而在他那潛意識中蒙起如何反映了。</p>
<p>假如，當地的遊擊隊的領導工作優良，阿Q毫無疑義地會站到抗戰的陣營中來，否則，他不是逃難，就是仍舊繼續他的畸零人的飄流生活吧？</p>
<p>我相信：阿Q絕不會出於自願地去當「漢　」，我並且相信，當某方或漢　走過他身邊時，他至少會深惡而痛絕地往地上吐一口吐沫，以表示他對這些異端人的憎恨吧？</p>
<p>然而，這種人是不是我們目前所需要的鬥士呢？當然不是，因為，阿Q根本就不配做一個抗戰救亡的鬥士。可是，反過來說，這種人是否應該槍斃呢？這也未免過於埋滅了人性的過火的工作吧？我們別忘記掉人是會發展的，如果阿Q生在今日，不是更壞，就是更好起來，至少和辛亥革命當時的阿Q有些不同吧？</p>
<p>人人都以為魯迅先生槍斃了阿Q，其實，這是一種皮相解釋罷了。要知道槍斃阿Q的不是魯迅先生，而是辛亥革命當時的土豪劣紳與貪官污吏的黑暗勢力。處阿Q以死刑的，並非「阿Q正傳」的作者，而是封建社會的崩潰，與農村經濟破產的混亂時代。</p>
<p>一九三九·七·十二·上海</p>
<h3>搶救民族的蓓蕾</h3>
<p>— 星火</p>
<p>教養並重養成生活技能</p>
<p>改革習性充實處世準備</p>
<p>同樣的孩子有的在暖房似的家庭裹長成，有的却生來就受盡風霜雨雪的侵凌，是不是他們本性上有着差別，不，這不過是現社會的一種病態，同時更是我們成人的恥辱。</p>
<p>在上海，流浪兒童的衆多，原已形成一個嚴重的社會問題，尤其在戰事發生以後，各地難民紛聚孤島，流浪兒童更是增加，他們還未達到自立謀生的年齡，在極度惡劣的環境中，除了極小部份做到小販或者童工以外，大都終日求乞街頭，到了迫不得已時，有的更流為小偷，因此，救濟流浪兒童這一問題在今日是日益嚴重，日益迫切。</p>
<p>今年二月中，看到了上海兒童保育會籌設丐童教養院的計劃，知道熱心社會事業的先進們，已注意到教養丐童的重要，而且正在進行着這項極有意義的工作；當時在感奮之餘，更熱誠地期望着這計劃早日實現。最近，得到了丐童教養院（現已定名為上海保育院）工作進行狀况的報告，知道該院已舉出負責人員開始籌募丐童服裝用品，這消息更使筆者感到無限的欣幸，——為着全上海累萬苦兒充滿光明的前途而欣幸。</p>
<p>這裹有幾點管見願貢獻於主持上海保育院的先生們，藉表筆者贊助之忱：</p>
<p>切實做到教養並重，除了灌輸普通知識以外，更當注意於生活技能的養成，改革丐童的行為與品性，使他們在出院後能自食其力做一個善良而有為的公民。</p>
<p>培養堅韌耐勞的習性，明瞭當前的世界與國家的大勢，充實立身處世的準備。</p>
<p>受到保育院教養的苦兒，多半曾在飢寒綫上經過長時間的掙扎與苦鬥，他們有着克服環境的生命力同時更富於求知向上的心，只要我們能因才施教，能使他們發揚個性，定能從苦兒羣裹提拔出不少充滿光輝的天才。</p>
<p>兒童是國家的命脈是民族的蓓蕾，兒童保育在先進國家早已列為要政；在理想的社會裹，流浪兒童原是不會存在的。如果有人將苦兒的流於小偷，癟三，歸結到他們自己的不學好或者本性太壞，那末請讀一下魯迅先生譯的童話「錶」，牠會告訴你：一個流浪兒怎樣在新的環境中得到悔悟，而做起新時代的兒童來。</p>
<h3>（三）親近上帝之益（續昨）</h3>
<p>— 謝</p>
<p>（一）親近上帝，對於禱告最有好處，能够助長人們的敬畏之心和虔誠之念。（二）親近上帝，使我們對於上帝生一種堅决的信仰，對於敵人無所恐　。對於敵人無所恐　。對於一切苦難能够忍受，因為我們知道上帝就在近邊，必定　把我們從患難中拯救出來。（三）親近上帝能使人常常快樂。（四）親近上帝必生謙卑之心，因為我們愈是親近上帝愈覺自己和上帝相差之大，愈覺上帝恩惠無窮給我們衣，食，住所使我們沒有欠缺。——禱告文——求主使我勿因富而忘記自己的地位，勿因貧而忘記上帝，勿因快樂而離開主的路徑，勿因恐　而違背主的誠命。主啊，願你的靈　遠與我同在，使我有愛人之心，正直無私，誠實忠心，充滿宗教的精神，疾惡如仇，從善如流。又求主使我謙卑順服，熱心虔誠，不妒忌別人的善行，同時，極力自重，不為他人所輕視，若是我做錯了，求主教訓我，糾正我。</p>
<p>以上的禱文每日可以讀一遍，可以與上帝親近。——上海基督教文字佈道會郵箱一二二七號</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　烟火千家鄉村合作　波濤萬里瀛海飛行</p>
<p>自由村中最努力的，是集體與合作兩件事。集體方面，他們有集體農塲，集體養　塲，集體養雞塲等等。他們將來還預備設立集體的工廠咧。合作方面，他們有消費合作，生產合作，其餘合作的事業，也都在着手進行咧。他們村中，有一家合作商店，起初資本很小的，開辦時只有三百塊錢。這是朱村長的一位姪孫發起的，發起的時候，每股五元，凑成六十股。當時規定每人只許一股，便凑成了六十人，也算是試辦性質。合作商店所售的，都是日用必需之品，他們初辦時，全是一種游戲性質，誰知到如今，竟成了自由村一個重要的消費機關了。中國向來有一種所謂小雜貨店的，都市地方有，鄉村地方也有。都市地方，可以擴大成為百貨商店，然而大的百貨商店，却漸成壟斷性質。鄉村地方，倒是取的便利主義。在自由新村初組織的時候，有些東西，他們必須要到別個市鎮上去購買，這不是有許多不便呢？因此他們便組織了這個合作商店，是六十位村民的股東，規定出售六十種貨物。經理這家合作商店的，是朱愛人的一位堂房哥哥，喚作朱愛立。他也並不曾研究過什麼合作法的精義，也不曾在什麼商業學校裹畢過業。他們不過說高興了，便這樣辦起來了。自由村也有一條大街，有幾家建築得比較講究的房屋，都在那條大街上。還有郵政代辦處，公共汽車站，村會議所，一個小小的菜塲，還有新辦的民衆教育館，村圖書館等等，都在那裹。朱愛立便在郵政代辦處的隔壁，借了一間屋子，便把這合作商店辦起來了。最初出售的商品，都是屬於那種輕巧的日用必需品，譬如肥皂，毛巾，信封信箋，學堂用品，家庭常　，火柴，洋燭之類。但是後來又擴張到手電筒，橡皮鞋，熱水瓶，以及汗衫，紗襪，草帽，絨綫，兒童玩具之類，也都有了。起初規定是六十種貨品的，現在那裹止六十種。而且這三百塊的資本不够了，於是就擴張到資本一千元，股本每股改為十元，仍舊規定是每人僅能入一股，但倘然一家有八個人的，不問老幼，也許他們可以有八股。（一五八）</p>
<h3>梅花三弄</h3>
<p>— 思華</p>
<p>Three　lovers　hao　naucy</p>
<p>這是美國劇作者特地為公子哥兒烹飪的一味「珍品」，當少爺們玩厭了都市中的摩登姑娘時，叫你嘗嘗鄉村姑娘的味兒，所謂「吃厭了山珍海味反覺得青菜蘿蔔美」。「梅花三弄」的劇作者所搬出來的便是「青菜蘿蔔」，不過在「青菜蘿蔔」上面已經加上了「香　」「突梯」的香料，使公子哥兒們見着就滿意地笑了。這些，是窮小子們想不到也沒有功夫去想的，祇有生長在黃金國的少爺們的「獵異」的頭腦里才會製造得出這樣理想的「珍品」的。</p>
<p>但，美國導演的「花色蛋糕」是做得高明的。看是那麼一個架空的故事，却搬弄得很緊凑，熱鬧，詼諧。不談意識，單講技巧，那些庸俗的中國導演是應該學習學習的。舉例來說：如（一）藍茜在上火車時，稱掉了東西，奈理士為她去取，及至返身，火車已開動，藍茜在車上呌，奈理士在站上追，鏡頭中是奈理士睜圓了眼珠的特　（急速度的退鏡頭）。（二）奈理士帶藍茜上跳舞，藍茜隨便與旁座的男子點頭，該男子過來與她招呼，她却說並不認識他。後，又看見那用火燒的菜，藍茜以為失慎，急奔過去用水來澆熄，衆大笑。這些戲，都很能使歡衆笑口常開。不過要記　的，不是它的無聊的內容，是它的圓活的技巧。</p>
<p>這里三個主角的戲，以蒙高茂萊的戲最有風趣，在學佛蘭支通夢中行走的行動，入被後得神的笑，面部的表情也可取，而藍茜和羅拔的家人相見，他在旁得意的恣態，也屬生動。佛蘭支通飾羅拔，戲較少於蒙高茂萊，平平的塲面較多，但他的個性却相當顯露，酒醉胡塗的神氣，很能一貫保持的。扮演藍茜的珍尼蓋諾，演戲十分努力，但她的年齡顯示然不大合這個人物，至少，她在前半段戲里沒有做出青春潑刺的鄉村姑娘的味道來，她的外形和動作都很都市的。</p>

<h3>馮超然先生增潤詩</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>馮君超然，今之石谷也。尺素寸縑，海內爭寶，嘗與余縱談繪事，源流派別，如數家珍，書畫之餘，尤喜吟詠，彼嘗謂書畫一道，本無一定價值可言，若書畫而視同貨殖，品斯下矣。顧書畫而不同於貨殖，我不知世人更將以何物視之也。又謂：余今茲改訂潤例，略有增加，世人或訝為值之貴，但今之為物，無一不倍增其值，或且數倍之，何獨於書畫而不可增乎？且熙攘之人類，無一不謀其生者，顧我亦人耳，何嘗不　斯粥斯衣食於斯也。古人詩曰：「青山寫出君買，勝似人間造孽錢，」故當世癖余之畫者，得之而心賞神怡，終身玩之而不盡，而余取其值以餬余口，不亦無愧我心乎？余聞其言，深為感喟，因讀先生近作增加潤例詩，而拉雜書之如此。馮君詩如左：</p>

<h3>荀慧生即將南來說</h3>
<p>— 愛萍室主</p>
<p>邇來本市戲劇界盛會四大名旦之一荀慧生受聘本市某大戲院，於八月底即將南來云云，是項消息是否確實？俟後即可知曉，茲略述荀慧生之生平，作其南來之前奏曲，料讀者諸君所樂聞也！</p>
<p>荀慧生，原名詞，字懸聲，爲直隸東光人，初入龐啟華之門，學秦腔花旦，附學於正樂社，與青衣尚小雲並稱，其最初藝名「白牡丹」，因是爲其後援者乃創立白社，與彼提携，其二黃青衣，係薛芬所授，其做　實有絕妙之藝術，一經紛墨登場，即能以劇中人自況，活潑生動，混身有戲，茲就其唱工，念白，做表等各方面簡略述之，用爲紹介：</p>
<p>（一）唱王　慧生之唱，柔和如女子，無梅（蘭芳）尚（小雲）之剛勁，而純以柔取勝，聞潤委婉，亢墜自如，絲毫不現枯澀，此可於全本玉堂春一劇證其工力。「玉堂春」一劇，凡屬青衣，殆無不能演者，但以一人演全本者實稀，四大名旦之三梅尚程均未嘗唱全本，皆僅演「起解」，「會審」而已，至多唱至「團圓」，惟　慧生則自「嫖院」起，包括「梳妝」，「廟會」，「被騙」，「起解」，「會審」，「探監」，以迄「大團圓」止，由一人飾玉堂春，唱作繁重，始終不懈，令人吧觀止焉。</p>
<p>（二）念白　慧生之念白，與其做工相互爲用，面部表情喜怒哀樂，念白亦隨之與俱，頗能體會心理性情。</p>
<p>（三）做表　慧生之做表，實居四大名旦之首座，蓋其頗爲劇中人設身著想，其扮演大家閨秀，小家碧玉，均能將兒女心事傳神入妙，體貼入微，而又不越情情理，不涉累佻，更見難乎其難也。</p>
<p>（四）武功　慧生武功自幼即有根底，又因曾習秦腔，對於蹻工，亦曾苦練，故其蹻工之美，現除於連泉（小翠花）外，無足與其倫匹者，如二本「虹霓關」東方氏之躥帳，（慧生演「虹霓關」，始終以一人飾東方氏，與他伶頭本節東方氏，二本飾丫鬟者不同。）「戰宛城」鄒氏之跌撲，其技術之穩練美妙，足表示其武功非他人所能及者也。</p>
<p>（五）扮像　慧生扮相豔媚溫柔，令人生美感，尤以眼角眉梢之表情，幾使人疑其非男子身，亦可見其扮相臻乎化境矣！</p>
<p>上述五項，僅就大略者述之，實不足言其藝百分之　一也，其尤售價驚異者，即新劇之多，堪稱「首屈一指」，此類新劇，編製均極文雅，不涉絲毫粗濫，如「西湖主」，「紅梨記」，「鈫頭鳳」，「丹青引」，「元宵謎」，「繡簫記」，「還珠吟」，「香羅帶」，「荊釵記」，「柳如是」，「一丈青」，「紅樓二尤」等多至數十齣，編劇者如陳墨香，陳劍西，均爲編劇名手，故此類新劇之價值，亦自不凡矣！</p>
<p>慧生之得名，獲做工之賜者固居泰半，然實得力於新劇者變復不生，其不來海上，七八年矣！若南來消息屬實，則此等佳劇，將一一獻於海上愛好戲劇諸君之前，以慰渴望也！</p>
<h3>伶·票·影·在新新電台</h3>
<p>— 海生</p>
<p>參加時疫病院播音義賣</p>
<p>前天下午二時起，在新新電台聚集了伶.票.影三界的人物，替上海時疫病院再舉行一次播音義賣，因爲有電影明星參加，情形好像比較熱鬧些，他和她們號召了許多的影迷，都捐款到電台上來參觀，而且還有一種榮譽座，是專給捐款最踴躍的大善士來坐的。</p>
<p>這個新的新新電台，設在茶室裏面，播音間是完全由下班造成的，所以坐在外面的人，既聽得到，又見得著，這天參加的伶.票.影界的同志們，個個的盧山真面目都清晰地在者面前顯露著，從參觀者的眼光看來，在玻璃間播音的人，卻像一條條的熱帶魚。</p>
<p>此次的主辦，是票友組負責，像包小蝶，袁森齊，張中原，五本善，汪其俊都分頭忙碌地幹著招待和報告工作，其他來參加播音的名票，也大不乏人。</p>
<p>影星播音的時間，是從五時開始，張石川和劉繼羣最早向電台報到，接着張善琨和童月娟，路明，徐琴芳，王獻齋，韓蘭要，殷秀岑，龔稼農，王吉亭，洪警鈴等也一批批由院方派汽車陸續接到，最受影迷注目的卻是殷秀岑，韓蘭根，劉繼羣三個寶貝，他們合唱王老五的時候，怪模怪樣，引得參觀者笑個不休，影響裏面有不少會唱平劇的，我們認爲是「壞蛋」的王獻齋，也唱了一段青衣。</p>
<p>從八點一刻起，仍舊由票伶們繼續播唱，麒麟童，高百歲都帶着太太同來，言菊朋坐了一會，沒有唱就走，他的女公子慧珠小姐卻唱了一齣六月雪，是她哥哥少朋操琴合作的，一起到三點鍾，主事者向聽衆道謝和報告成績，這次的義賣就功德圓滿了。</p>

<h3>星六星紀之四－金莉莉</h3>
<p>日前梯公電餘，謂素不喜跳舞，不閱舞文，惟於尊作，則以先睹爲快，爲其參觀有致，故能妙趣環生。不意梯公聰慧過人，乃爲余所蔽，余舞技既拙，閨中復有限制歸時之令，故於舞術既不敢有所論列，又不暇刺探舞場中一切隱事，如庖丁烹肉，主要原料既感缺乏，祇得七拼八湊，多加些和頭耳，一笑。</p>
<p>客歲余初蒞大都會，先進友人謂曰，若知此間舞孃，何人最輕，余曰，是易知耳，短小玲瓏者輕，一至於此，乃請其介，曰金莉莉，試就與舞，身前若未有人，而明膽有人焉。神乎技矣，訝怪久之，聞其故，曰，但用心熟習耳。憶操琴者，於每一工譜，非拉至千遍以上，不可以示人，則莉莉之言，非慮說也。</p>
<p>莉莉身材，穢　適中，非廋弱者流，貌僅中姿，而言語溫和，儀態大方，不驕不鄙，上選材也。春間百樂門選舉十大舞星，莉莉與焉。讀書不　，聞願　　理。無　嗜皮簧，擾青衣，已能　　餘　，嗓音甜美，有寬音，不類女子，後不知自何處聞余名，請以師事，余嘉其志，允之，然實自慚，尺寸字眼，多未爲改正也。</p>
<p>疇昔之日，莉莉倩人激余飲於其庽，至則其史出肅客，似曾相識，莉莉復出一照片相示，凡十二人，中座爲家大人，余及小村侍坐左右，金史則立於家君之後，蓋距今十年矣，則金史固曾列道　門牆者矣。今莉莉復爲余弟子，其間殆有囚會。金母聞余至，亦出歛袵，操浦東口音，母子俱嗼曰，不圖一這－有生活，乃竟賴莉莉奔負，言下不勝欷歔，金亦爲之感嘅！既而慰之曰，舞場中正好擇佳婿，以莉莉之穩　重機智，無虞其趨下游也，時莉莉背其面，似在飲泣，余不忍再談，乃轉詢其家世，據云，賦閒垂三十年矣。繼其父瞻家者，則爲其史，歷年服務福建軍界戰事起，則又各企業，便宜負擔，乃萃於莉莉一身，而莉莉苦矣。其母亦知莉苦苦，乃以姪女弟弟爲之副，且亟欲擇婿，余曰，汝知擇婿之難乎，曰，知之，然則奈何？曰，汝意莉莉一旦獲佳婿，則一家生活胥保以由婿負之，莉莉之重負乃可釋乎？金母欣然額首曰，先生之言，實獲我心。余曰，且住，汝知汝婿既須負荷汝金家生活，又須負其本身之全家生活，一人生之，數十人食之，則汝婿之苦，可勝言耶，汝婿苦而莉莉能不苦耶？若從巨富爲妾勝，富家市妾，猶商賈市貨，一旦色衰，將棄如敝屐，汝家將保所恃耶？故汝家當謀　節之　，曾任事者，當不辭薪給微薄，以謀　　，莉莉擇婿，當以能始終相爲主要，而以能瞻家若幹爲次要，至是，莉莉忽笑靨相承，問曰，多讀書可以知人心事耶，余誦東坡句答曰，若信萬殊歸一理，子今知我我知魚，並爲擇其義。</p>
<h3>公演「阿Q正傳」前奏</h3>
<p>— 高風</p>
<p>五四運動以後，愈經轟動，　　字，而被世界名作家，　世界文壇，譯成英俄數，譽爲中國文學吤代表作的「阿Q正傳」，今天（十五）由中法劇社，在辣斐德路辣斐花園劇場公演了。</p>
<p>「阿Q正傳」是魯迅氏初期著作生涯中，最成功的一部，「阿Q正傳」之所以爲成功，就是在於描寫的深刻，和筆鋒底潑辣，阿Q是中國民間最普遍的典型人物，這種人物一直到目前還存在著，魯迅寫這部小說已有二十年之久，但這部小說直至現在，還沒有失去它的朝代性。</p>
<p>阿Q是一個精神勝利法的「取勝者」，譬如有好幾次，他被他的敵人抓住了辦子（該書的寫作對象和時代，還是在滿清末年。）痛打，阿Q力不能敵，任其痛打，打過了，看見敵人已去遠了，約敢站起來，喃喃的說一聲：「她媽的總算老子被兒子打了，這世界越變越不像樣了，」……來藉以自慰。</p>
<p>「阿Q正傳」這部書的內容，是包括他一生的經過和生涯，自做長工起至被槍斃止，全部非常生動，非常發噱，題材固然嚴肅，描寫卻是非常輕鬆。現在這部小說由許幸之改編爲成本，中法劇社假座辣斐劇場公演，成績如何，固不可知，但能吸引孤島民衆的注意，那是無疑的！</p>

<h3>壞人的話（下）</h3>
<p>— 王獻齋</p>
<p>「壞人」的本願與期望</p>
<p>我的本業以前是西法眼科醫生，在上海曾經掛過　幾年牌子——醫名為王有廷。彼時從　西醫業者尚少　，西法眼科尤絕無其人；雖則當醫生也是一種福利人　羣的業務，但我以為畢竟　於一端，沒有戲劇電影那　樣可以用為教育社會工具的廣及大眾。自己對於戲劇　工作，早年在學生時期即極愛好；後來正値國產電影　萌芽初出的機會，因即毅然捨棄本業，專心一志地開　始努力於這新的事業起來。</p>
<p>電影這工作，自先便即認定是我終身的事業；所　以無論怎樣環境不好，像往時期的整個國片業陷入困　境，常閙欠薪恐慌至於生活發生問題時，亦仍甘之如　飴，從沒有過分毫別作良謀的意念；因為我的整個生　命是早就寄托在這事業上面的。倘使僅作衣食之謀，　或是為圖享樂的話，那麼當醫生到現在，也該早有汽　車可坐，洋房可住，根本上就不會放棄本業不幹了。</p>
<p>現在非常時期下的許多非常情形，大家都覺十分　痛心。一般人都咒罵我是罪大惡極的「壞人」，而實　際上的壞人，却還十百倍於我在銀幕上的表現。目前　，有許多現實性的戲劇，可恨環境上不容由我來作痛　快淋漓的表演，否則將我一腔悲憤，從這上面心情發　洩起來，我想一定會較以前演過許多壞人更見得精彩　。不過這亦純由劇情使然，說起來是實在太覺痛心了　！</p>
<p>最後，我的感想是希望整個環境以至社會情狀都　能早見好轉過來。使得我這銀幕上的「壞人」也好及　早改行為善，勿再有甚作惡的機會。</p>

<h3>Chinese Army Repeatedly Charges into Yuncheng; Fierce Street Battles Annihilate Many Japanese Soldiers; Japanese Army Repeatedly Makes Contact Attacking Northward from the Bojin Highway; Chinese Forces Control the Outskirts of Fengxin, Japanese Situation Perilous; Japanese Advance Along the Guangzhou-Huaxian Highway, Suffering Over 500 Casualties</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) Since their defeat at Zhongtiao Mountain, the Japanese have been gradually withdrawing to Yuncheng to regroup. The Chinese army seized the opportunity to charge into the city multiple times, engaging in fierce street battles with the Japanese and killing many of them. Yuncheng is now under strict guard. Japanese Commander Sugiyama recently transferred two brigades from the Zhengtai Line, Taiji, and Taishan, to reinforce Yuncheng, Wenxi, Anyi, Houma, and other locations. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yingde. On the morning of the 11th, a unit of over 200 Japanese infantry from Longkou arrived near Ping Shan Lianglong. A Chinese unit went to engage them, and in the fierce battle that lasted until 11:00 AM, over half of the Japanese troops were annihilated. Over 800 Japanese infantry came to reinforce them, along with four Japanese aircraft providing air support. Another unit of over 800 infantry and cavalry attempted to outflank the Chinese on their sides via He'anli Qiling. The Chinese army launched fierce attacks from multiple directions, and the bloody battle is still ongoing. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing. At noon on the 12th, two Japanese warships sailed to the Heqing River area, patrolling the waters before shelling and harassing the Helu Lishui area in Heshan County. The Chinese side suffered no losses. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Over 10,000 Japanese troops from Yicheng and Jiangxian have been fiercely attacking the Chinese forces from Peiziling, Diaoshangou, and other places for days. The fighting is extremely intense. On the morning of the 11th, in the battle of Yangjiamen, a Chinese unit valiantly ambushed the enemy, killing over 600 Japanese soldiers. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) On the Jinnan front, the Japanese army that invaded Wanghe southwards captured Qinyuan on the 7th. On the 8th, they continued to flee southeast towards Dongjiacun and Zhongcun, where they joined up with over 1,000 Japanese troops from the Hongtun Highway, Liangma. On the 10th, they advanced to Heshen Temple (west of Tunliu). A Chinese unit has already rushed to intercept them. According to military experts, the current Japanese actions seem to be an attempt to sweep away the large Chinese army in southeastern Shanxi, and to seize Changzhi and Jincheng to deploy heavy troops, thereby reducing the threat to their rear and protecting the safety of the Daoqing, Pinghan, Zhengtai, and Tongpu lines in preparation for a future invasion south across the Yellow River. However, the large Chinese army in southern Shanxi is gathering, moving flexibly, and possessing great strength. This Japanese move is nothing but a pipe dream. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) The Japanese army in the triangle area of southern Shanxi has not made any major moves recently. In the past ten days, 5,000 Japanese troops from Boa'ai on the western section of the Daoqing Railway have been attacking northwards along the Bojin Highway, engaging with the Chinese army near Lanchezhen. The fighting is quite fierce. Over 20,000 Japanese troops from Handan on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway have reached Wu'an, appearing to be attacking Dongyang. Over 10,000 Japanese troops along the Zhengtai and Tongpu lines are attacking southwards along the highways. Another division is attacking eastwards from Anze and Fushan and along the Hongtun Highway, while the main Japanese force is attacking eastwards in multiple directions along the Longqin Highway and the southern area, attempting to invade the Chinese guerrilla base areas in southeastern Shanxi. For days, various Chinese units have been fiercely battling the Japanese in areas south of Liaoxian and Qinxian, northwest of Qinshui, southeast of Anze, and east of Qinshui. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan. On the 12th, over 3,000 Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery used artillery fire as cover to advance along the Guangzhou-Huaxian Highway towards Jigongji, Shiba Ridge, Huangwang Ridge, and Pingshan. The Chinese army met them head-on. In the bloody battle that lasted until dusk, the Japanese troops were unable to hold their ground and retreated towards Longkou. In this battle, over 500 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, along with over 100 military horses. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to today's Chinese sources, of the five routes by which the Japanese army attacked Zhongtiao Mountain, up until now, they have captured Liaoxian, Qinxian, and Hehafen (transliteration). The fighting in the Boa'ai area is also extremely fierce. In northern Jiangxi, the villages and towns on the outskirts of Fengxin are under Chinese control, and the Japanese troops in Fengxin are in a very precarious situation. The Japanese troops in Yuekou Junshan in northern Hunan have also been cleared by the Chinese forces. In northern Jiangsu, the Chinese army has recovered Siyang. In the Hangzhou Chongde area, the fighting between the Chinese and Japanese armies is also extremely fierce. (14th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Concession Blockaded for a Month, General Situation Unchanged, Japanese Sentries' Inspections Looser Than Before, Anti-British Movement Spreads in Kaifeng and Qingdao, Anglo-Japanese Negotiations to Be Held in Tokyo Today</h3>
<p>(Qingdao) Today, someone threw two hand grenades into the British Consulate, which landed in the open area of the consulate and exploded with a loud bang. The people inside the consulate and those nearby were startled, but no one was injured. Only the consulate building was slightly damaged. After receiving the news, the Japanese side immediately expressed its apologies to the British side and decided to investigate the perpetrators. It is currently unknown who committed this act. Some say that someone threw the grenades from a car while passing in front of the consulate, while others say that it was done by professional anti-British activists. As for the Japanese consulate, some believe that the Japanese side knew about this beforehand, but claimed that it was done by anti-Japanese elements to increase the difficulties in Anglo-Japanese relations. (14th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It has been a month since the Japanese side blockaded the British and French concessions here. Although the Japanese newspapers in this city and the Chinese newspapers they control have been carrying out extensive anti-British propaganda, the general situation remains unchanged. The supply of food into the British concession has returned to normal, but prices remain extremely high. The inspections by Japanese sentries are also looser than before, so no incidents have occurred on the British side. However, the situation in the Haihe area is relatively serious. At the same time, foreigners in this city believe that after the failure of the Tokyo conference, the situation here will become even worse. (14th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from Beiping today, the anti-British movement in Kaifeng is also growing daily. Yesterday, over 1,000 Chinese controlled by the Japanese side held a demonstration in the streets of Kaifeng. After the demonstration, the crowd went to the churches and schools of the British people, demanding that the British withdraw from Kaifeng.

<p>(London) Regarding the Japanese military's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, the British and Japanese authorities will immediately hold negotiations in Tokyo. Various newspapers here have commented on this matter. The Daily Express reported that "Although we cannot fight Japan at its doorstep, we can cut off its foreign trade with our navy in places beyond its reach. This is a very easy thing to do. Our country is also one of Japan's largest customers, and the Japanese government hopes that the financial circles here will provide it with credit and financial convenience. If it takes a risky move and wants to fight our country, then our country should destroy its economic system." (14th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) During today's meeting in the House of Commons, Labour MP McLean inquired about the arrest of British Army Attache to China, Lieutenant Colonel Spear, by the Japanese army, saying that Lieutenant Colonel Spear would be tried by a Japanese military court and that the government had received formal notification. He also said that Lieutenant Colonel Spears had been arrested for over six weeks, and since Japan had not declared war on China, it had no right to exercise control over third countries within Chinese territory. He asked whether the government intended to demand the restoration of Lieutenant Colonel Spear's freedom from the Japanese military on this basis. Foreign Office official Butler immediately submitted a written reply, stating, "Regarding the first point, the government has not received formal notification. As for the second point, I already made a statement yesterday." (According to official Butler yesterday, the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, is continuing to work to rescue Lieutenant Colonel Spear.) (13th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Colonel Hirota, who is in charge of the blockade of Tianjin, told a reporter from the Berlin "Attack Report" that as of July 11, 3,000 Chinese residents had moved out of the British concession in Tianjin since the Japanese implemented the blockade. Since the implementation of the blockade, a total of 148,000 residents have left the British concession, while only 145,000 people have entered the British concession. The 3,000 people who moved out are mostly workers, and the British authorities are now doing their best to prevent the Chinese working class from leaving, so as not to affect various businesses in the concession. When the reporter asked when the Japanese blockade of the British concession would end, Hirota replied that this would depend on the attitude of the British, as the Japanese side demanded that Britain recognize Japan's position in the Far East. (14th Haitong Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Labour MP Maclean inquired in the House of Commons today about the shooting of the British tugboat "Saxon" by Japanese soldiers in Tianjin on Sunday, and suggested that the Japanese authorities should be notified immediately that such actions should not occur again. Foreign Office official Butler replied that the report received by Foreign Secretary Halifax did not say that Japanese soldiers had shot at the British tugboat, but rather that on July 10, Japanese soldiers had shot at a barge owned by the Datian Tugboat Company, injuring three Chinese. The Japanese soldiers opened fire seemingly because of a small Chinese boat, which had been detained by the Japanese side but had escaped and approached the British barge. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The United States Disregards Japanese Threats</h3>

However, the State Department has only heard this news via wireless radio and has not yet received a formal notification from the Japanese side. (13th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Wang Kemin Opposes "Federal Government"</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese reporters here were shocked to hear the statement from Wang Kemin, the head of the Beiping "Provisional Government," opposing the establishment of a "federal government" in the Japanese-occupied areas. Wang, who had just returned to Beiping after attending a joint meeting in Qingdao of senior Japanese officials and officials from the Beiping and Nanjing "governments" under Japanese protection, told Chinese, foreign, and Japanese reporters today that the Qingdao meeting did not discuss the proposed new government, and that Wang Jingwei did not participate in the meeting. He also said that the next meeting, scheduled for August, would also not discuss the new federal government. Japanese reporters were greatly surprised to hear this and asked many questions, but Wang Kemin's answers only made them more discouraged. It is reported that the "Provisional Government" does not intend to issue any statements in support of or in response to Wang Jingwei's recent declaration and peace appeal. The people of North China have different opinions on Wang's remarks, with some supporting them and others criticizing them. The "Provisional Government" generally agrees with Wang's hope for an end to the war, but opinions differ greatly on the methods of achieving peace. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On Stabilizing Prices</h3>
<p>Since the soaring of prices, many people have discussed it, but without helping to stabilize prices. It is known that mere words are not enough to solve the problem. It is also true that talking about stabilizing prices today is untimely, unsuited to the place, and unsuited to the people. Why do I say this? Because today is a time of war. In wartime economics, the value of currency loses its standard, production loses its regularity, and transportation loses its convenience, so how can prices not change? The place is the occupied area, and the situation is extraordinary after the land has fallen. Mencius said, "How can the world be settled? It must be settled in one." Today, the environment is complex, and there is nothing more unstable than prices. Therefore, seeking price stability is not too difficult? As for the people, there are many talented people, but who can take charge of the overall situation and coordinate the causes and effects of price increases and decreases? Who can adjust the surpluses and deficits and equalize the highs and lows? Who can effectively manage it? Even with brilliant skills, it is impossible to bring spring back. Even with great talent, it is difficult to realize ambitions. This is why Shanghai's prices ultimately remain restless and uneasy.</p>
<p>What's more, the perception of price expensiveness varies from person to person depending on their circumstances. First, the basis of daily life is different. The high prices of rice, wheat, cloth, oil, salt, and vegetables are not as painful to those with a comfortable life as the rising prices of cigars, champagne, gasoline, and pollen. The money spent on a single throw in a dance hall is enough for a commoner's food for a month, so those who are struggling to make a living are indifferent to it. Second, the tastes are different. Those who eat wheat are different from those who eat grains, and those who eat meat are different from those who are vegetarians. Their empathy is separated from each other. If the level of life is very different, their feelings are also different. Only those with the same tastes have the same feelings, and only those with the same feelings have the same compassion. Third, the concept of currency value is different. For example, the price of one dan of rice, calculated in British pounds, is only a few shillings, which is not worth mentioning. One US dollar is a small number, but it is enough to provide food for Chinese refugees for two months. If half a pound is combined with one Chinese currency, then the amount that is given to people's ideas is no longer a small number. Fourth, the interests are different. The majority of consumers want prices to fall, while those who manipulate and hoard goods are afraid that prices will not rise. It is like people are afraid of hurting benevolence, and those who shoot people are afraid that they will not hit, which is what they truly want. Fifth, the business vision is different. For example, if the price of rice does not rise above twenty-one yuan, how can foreign rice be imported? As the price of rice soared, there was a large amount of foreign rice transactions. It can be seen that each has their own selfish motives, and the so-called price problem varies from person to person, and the difference is as great as between sky and earth. The rise in prices is like a straight line rising, so no matter how early or late the opportunity, as long as there is capital, it will always be advantageous and in control. The result of this is that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Wealth will be concentrated in a few people. It is appropriate to celebrate for the rich, but how can we not imagine the crisis? If today's prices continue to rise rapidly, it will inevitably lead to social unrest. The vast majority of people will not have enough to eat or wear. If you think about it for a moment, what kind of world will it become? If that is the case, what is the value of the wealth they own? For example, in the occupied areas of the inland, products are stagnant. What is gold in Europe and the United States is now like dung in the inland. At every turn, there are arbitrary exactions and levies, which do not compensate for the losses. Storage is only for the sake of being plundered, and there is no way to appeal. Prices have fallen to the extreme, but is this a good phenomenon? Therefore, it is known that the so-called price problem has too many aspects, and it is not easy to say.</p>
<p>However, speaking practically, we cannot avoid being responsible for the financial sector. If the financial sector does not use its funds to be active in the commodity market, the transactions would not be so prosperous. If the financial sector does not accept speculative hoarding of goods at high discounts, the turnover would not be so flexible. Who can store thousands of dan of white rice at home? There are banks and warehouses. Who can carry hundreds of thousands of cash on their person? There are bank transactions. Even foreign exchange arbitrage, exchange discounts, capital flight, and soaring gold prices are all directly or indirectly related to the financial sector. Shouldn't it be the normal mission of the financial industry to develop production and support legitimate industry and commerce with the savings of the people's blood and sweat stored in the financial industry? However, due to their short-sightedness, they mistakenly believe that hoarded commodities are the only good object for mortgages and loans. This is obvious. They use their sleeves to dance well, and they use turnover as a means of support, thus fueling the trend of speculation. They wait for prices to rise and calmly observe the changes. How can the market price not rise? It is true that for a bank, the profit is high, and people flock to it, forming a trend. However, in terms of the mission of the entire financial industry, and in terms of the entire society and people's livelihood that the financial industry relies on, we cannot but hope that the wise men of the financial sector will persuade their colleagues and correct each other immediately. If this is the case, the part of the price increase caused by the financial industry will gradually return to normal. Although this is not enough to make all prices tend to stability, it will certainly be of great benefit to the society and people's livelihood.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Invade Chao-Shan: A Major Battle Expected Between Anbu and Jieyang</h3>
<p>The northeastern gate of Chao'an has been razed to the ground. The county town of Chenghai has been captured by Japanese troops. Chinese troops have switched to a full offensive. Shantou communication: Aside from the more than 2,000 Taiwanese naval landing troops who invaded Shantou, most of the Japanese forces were transferred from Guangzhou. Units such as those of Hasegawa, Matsui, Takehara, and Hata, etc., were transported by ships overnight from Dongguan Taiping to Shantou, then transferred to motorboats and invaded the tributaries of the Han River and the coast of Jieyang. The Eastern Route Garrison Headquarters of the Japanese army in front of the Shantou Customs House is the Hata Brigade from Humen. The Soeda unit stationed around Qilu Waima Road is the Taiwanese naval landing force. The Fukuda unit stationed around the railway station in Chenghai Haoyu is an engineering unit that once built defenses in Zengcheng. The Japanese consulate on Shenzhao Road has been converted into the South China Military Transport Headquarters. A large quantity of artillery and equipment is stored in the open spaces of the Datong Swimming Pool and the Dongying School. The Central Bank on Yongping Road has been converted into the Japanese consulate. The newly appointed Japanese consul in Shantou is Takai Suehiko, and the vice-consul is Matsudaira Tadahisa. They began working on June 27th. The Japanese army uses the Soeda and Fukuda units, numbering about 600, to defend the rear of Shantou. The other units have all advanced toward Chao'an. Very few troops landed and stationed in Shantou. On the 26th, the city of Chao'an was surrounded by Japanese troops on three sides. Chinese troops constructed defenses at the West Gate Station, Hulu Mountain, and Zhugao Mountain, fighting to the death to cover the evacuation of various government agencies and the people to the upper reaches of the Han River and the Tiandong and Liuhuang areas of Fengshun County. On the morning of the 27th, the West Gate Station and Hulu Mountain fell. Japanese artillery set up cannons on the mountain, and Japanese cavalry charged in from the West Gate and South Gate. A certain Chinese army unit refused to retreat and defended the North Gate, Jinshan, and the North Embankment, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese army. More than ten locations in the city caught fire that day. By the 28th, the fire had not been extinguished. The unit is presumed to have been completely sacrificed. The Japanese artillery on Hulu Mountain concentrated its firepower on Jinshan Middle School and the shops on Taiping Road. The East Gate and North Gate have been razed to the ground. The Xiangzi Bridge was blown up by the Chinese army themselves. Forty freight and passenger cars of the Chao-Shan Railway were also blown up by the Chinese army with hand-pulled grenades before they left. The Chinese defending forces fought in confusion until the evening of that day before retreating amidst the flames toward Zhugao Mountain and the north of Chao City, moving into the mountainous area. The Japanese army could no longer advance north. On the 29th, the Japanese Mauri cavalry unit, numbering about 1,000, and the Masaki floating boat unit, numbering about 800, marched south from outside the South Gate of Chao'an. Because the Hua Zhenzhong Brigade, which had retreated into the Sangpu Mountain, received a telegram from Zhang Fakui ordering a swift counterattack and to sweep away the Japanese army in Jinshishi. There was a battle for three hours on the afternoon of the 28th. The Hua Zhenzhong Brigade received assistance from the local militia and swept away the Japanese transportation station in Longhu Yunbu Township. The 200 Japanese troops stationed there retreated by motorboat across Yinhu, awaiting reinforcements. At 7 a.m. on the 29th, the Mauri cavalry team galloped to the scene, rushed into Yunbu Township along the protective embankment road. The Hua Brigade had no choice but to retreat back to Jinshishi, destroying all the railways. The Masaki unit cleaned up the remnants of the Japanese army in Yinhu and then went downstream to Guanshan Township in Chenghai, landing on the embankment. At 3 p.m., they entered Chenghai City, and Chenghai fell. Bian, the magistrate of Chenghai, led the security team and strong men to resist the Masaki unit on the Huaru Neilu Township, Beilu embankment while crossing the river to Lianyang Donglu Zhanglin, because Chenghai City is in a low-lying basin, surrounded by river embankments on all sides, without any danger to defend.</p>
<p>The main force of the Japanese army is stationed outside the West Gate of Chao'an, and daily artillery battles with the Chinese army on Zhugao Mountain. The Japanese army, transferred from Guangzhou to Shantou along the Anjie Road, did not land in Shantou City, but instead used shallow-water warships and motorboats to sail up the Tuo River, engaging in fierce battles with the Zou Hong unit, the garrison commander of Chaozhou and Meizhou, in the Pao Taishi. Wu Qihui personally went to Qu Xi in Jieyang to supervise the battle, using 30,000 troops to guard Yujiao, Guanxi, and Jinkou on the Anjie Road, resisting the Japanese army attacking from both sides of Chao'an and Shantou. From the 28th to the 30th, the battle at Fengkou in Rongjiang was extremely fierce. When the Japanese army surrounded Chao City on three sides on the 26th, reinforcements from the upper reaches of the Han River rushed to the rescue. Those dispatched from Raoping advanced along the Cambodian coast of the Han River to the Nambei and Siji embankments of Chenghai Lianyang. The defending soldiers fought bitterly for six days, and the security team battalion commander was killed in battle. Another unit of reinforcements bypassed Anbu from Chenghai, already approaching Shantou City, and coordinated with the guerrillas in Sangpu Mountain, specializing in cutting off the Japanese army's rear support route in Chao'an. At this time, the Japanese army had changed its military focus and was heading towards Jieyang. On the 26th late at night, two Japanese shallow-water warships, towing civilian boats and rubber boats, carrying units of Hasegawa, Takehara, etc., invaded Pao Taishi in Jieyang, and used small boats to attack into Jinkou, Yuhui, and Qu Xi through the Xiao River, with the aim of seizing the Anjie Highway to prevent the Chinese army in Jieyang from entering Chao'an, and attempting to encircle the Chinese army retreating into the Sangpu Mountain, Qingmao Mountain, and Shenwu Mountain area. The above-mentioned mountains are the backbone of Chaozhou, Chenghai, and Jieyang counties, and can overlook the plains of the three counties. The Chinese army had made prior arrangements in this area, so a major bloody battle will occur at the junction of Jieyang and Anbu. Also, after the 26th, Japanese aircraft teams such as Yokoyama, Maruta, and Nakano flew to Heyuan, Laolong, Lechang, and Shaoguan, etc., to carry out bombings. More than 60 vehicles on the road were destroyed by bombing, and dozens of boats and ships carrying refugees were also sunk. Currently, millions of refugees are moving to the mountains on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi, displaced and in dire straits. Also, after July 1st, the Chinese army will switch to a full offensive. Gunfire is often heard in the suburbs of Shantou at night. Villages and fortresses close their gates to defend themselves, and do not communicate with Shantou City. The Japanese army also does not dare to invade the villages and carry out offensives.</p>
<h3>Japanese Barracks in Changan All Destroyed</h3>
<p>Haining communication: West of Wangdian on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, guerrilla attacks on the Japanese railway guards occur from time to time. Therefore, the Hangzhou-Shanghai train runs very slowly and is often suspended. More than 400 members of the Japanese Yamaguchi unit in Haining were transferred to Maqiao, and were ambushed by the Chinese army on the way. The exercise field, Japanese-style barracks, and brick and concrete fortresses built by the Japanese side at Changan Station were all destroyed by the Chinese side a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Line: Luoshe Station Attacked</h3>
<p>The Sakabe Unit Suffered Heavy Casualties: Wuxi communication: More than 300 members of the Chinese army's Li Mingyang unit attacked Luoshe Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway on the night of the 5th. The Sakabe unit of the Japanese garrison team stationed there suffered heavy casualties. The Li unit retreated to Donghenglin, which belongs to Changzhou County, due to strategic reasons. At the same time, when Japanese military supplies were being unloaded at Wuxi Station, 600 boxes of ammunition mysteriously disappeared. The Japanese army in Wuxi is now densely deploying sentries around the station to conduct a rigorous search.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army in the Suchang Area is Exhausted</h3>
<p>Fuhu Continues to be Bombed: Suzhou Communication: In recent days, Chinese troops along the Shanghai-Nanjing line have been actively moving around, making the Japanese army exhausted. On the night of the 5th, hundreds of members of the Chinese mobile team attacked Lujiabang Station, opening fire with the Japanese army stationed at the station. The Japanese army defended with bunkers. At the same time, there was fierce fighting between Dongguanyintang in Changshu and the Japanese army. The Chinese army also launched fierce counterattacks in Huazhou Xiayiqiao and Gehu, Yixing. The Japanese army was defeated, suffering more than 200 casualties. They then sent aircraft to various places on the 7th and 8th to conduct reconnaissance, and continued to indiscriminately bomb Gehu and other places. The Chinese mobile unit in Jiangyin also attacked the town. The Japanese army opened fire with the mobile team across the river in Shizijie Wujiaqiao. Both sides suffered casualties, and the residents fled.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Army in Northern Jiangsu Scores Repeated Successes</h3>
<p>Central Government Allocates Funds to Reward Troops: Taixian Communication: The Chinese army resolutely launched a counterattack on the county towns of Huai'an, Lianshui, and Siyang, successively entering the cities. Although Lianshui was abandoned again, it has given the Japanese army in northern Jiangsu a great setback. The morale of the Chinese army has been greatly boosted. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Han has repeatedly telegraphed the various battles to the Central Government. Yesterday, he received a commendation order from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, forwarded by Director Cheng of the Xi'an Provisional Headquarters, and rewarded 10,000 yuan to the officers and soldiers who contributed to various battles in this resolution, in order to encourage them.</p>
<h3>Poisonous Atmosphere Rising in Qingdao: Japanese Forcibly Conscripting Laborers, Residents Flee: Machinery Factory and Paper Cigarette Factory Completely Shut Down</h3>
<p>Dalu Bao reports: According to a reporter who recently arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao (on the 13th), the fields in Shandong Province are full of planted opium poppies. Qingdao is bound to become the most important export location for opium trade under the direct supervision of the Japanese. When he took the train to Jinan, he saw a field of opium poppies on both sides of the railway and drug dealers in each town busily preparing for a bumper harvest. Although there are laws in Shandong Province prohibiting the planting of opium poppies, a few people are arrested for planting opium poppies and are released after paying a small fine. The profit is eight yuan per mu. Chinese, Japanese, and Korean drug dealers are extremely active in Qingdao, preparing for this year's harvest. The Qingdao Japanese authorities are continuing to instigate anti-British sentiment, and the local laws and regulations are becoming increasingly lax. Shooting incidents occur from time to time. Most of the victims are Chinese people in the suburbs and city who are shot and wounded by Japanese soldiers. These Japanese soldiers seem to enjoy shooting innocent Chinese people as a form of entertainment. In addition to those who are shot and injured, there are also many who are stabbed to death. For example, one night a Chinese coolie came to a certain foreign hospital for treatment. His leg was stabbed severely by a bayonet. After being questioned by the surgeon who treated him, the injured person said that a Japanese soldier asked him for a cigarette, and when he did not get it, he stabbed him. The coolie was discharged from the hospital a week later. Japanese troops drive cars in Qingdao carelessly, causing frequent car accidents. So far, the victims have all been Chinese. After the accident, the Japanese troops do not stop the car and take the injured to the hospital. At the same time, Chinese youths in Qingdao are fleeing to the countryside in droves because the Japanese are forcibly conscripting laborers. One of the methods of forcible conscription is that Chinese youths between the ages of 18 and 25 must report to the puppet police headquarters to receive military training. Tens of thousands of people in Qingdao have fled to the countryside, and 20,000 people in Yantai have fled, resulting in a large shortage of labor in factories in the city. In Qingdao alone, the production of one oil factory has been cut in half, and the machinery factory and paper cigarette factory have completely shut down. Several clothing stores have also closed their doors, which is a direct result of the youths fleeing back to their hometowns.</p>

<h3>France Commemorates Democracy: Military Parade Held in Paris: Grandeur Unseen Since the European War: British Air Force Participates for the First Time</h3>
<p>(Paris) A military parade was held in Paris today, with grandeur unseen since the triumphal parade of July 14, 1919. British troops and sailors also participated. Before the troop parade, the sidewalks of the streets were already packed with spectators, and traffic was almost blocked. The air force soared through the sky, led by five squadrons of the British Air Force. At 10:30 a.m., they paid tribute to French President Lebrun, and then flew back to London. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today is France's National Day, coinciding with the 150th anniversary of the Great Revolution. Due to the precariousness of the international situation, general emotions are particularly excited. Therefore, the celebration is more enthusiastic than in previous years. Furthermore, the British army, navy, and air force also came to participate in the parade, which is also unprecedented in French history. Spectators have been waiting at the parade's thoroughfares since dawn, and some even camped overnight. The troops participating in the parade were also assembled in formation at the Étoile before the parade. Tank formations were responsible for guarding the surrounding plazas near the square. President Lebrun, Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier, Minister of the Navy Campinchi, and Minister of Aviation La Chambre successively arrived in cars. The President then got out of the car and took his seat, flanked by the King of Morocco, the Speaker of the Bulgarian National Assembly Mushanov, the British Secretary of War Hore-Belisha, the Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Pound, the Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Newall, the Chief of the General Staff Lieutenant-General Gort, and the British Conservative Party leader Churchill, all distinguished guests.

<h3>British Army, Navy, and Air Force Autumn Exercises: Extraordinary Scale</h3>
<p>(London) Local newspapers reported that the joint exercises of the British Army, Navy, and Air Force to be held in mid-August this year will involve 80,000 naval personnel, 150,000 regular army personnel, 150,000 national defense force personnel, 30,000 national service personnel, and 150,000 air force personnel. According to the Daily Telegraph's naval correspondent, the British Home Fleet, including six battleships, five large cruisers, two small cruisers, two aircraft carriers, three destroyer squadrons, five submarine squadrons, and many auxiliary ships, will be commanded by Commander Forbes and participate in the exercises. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) According to naval sources, when the British Navy holds exercises in August and September this year, more than 50 of the 130 ships belonging to the reserve fleet will participate, including one battleship, one aircraft carrier, four cruiser squadrons (totaling 16 ships), one minelayer, four destroyer divisions (totaling 30 ships), and four submarines. Furthermore, well-informed sources say that 12,000 officers and men of the Naval Reserve will also be called up. This is the first precautionary measure taken by the government, to show that Britain's national defense is fully prepared, and to maintain the advantage of proactive measures in both military strategy and diplomacy, in contrast to last year's failure to take defensive measures in time, which lagged behind Germany. It cannot be compared to that. According to reports, the British naval exercise was originally scheduled to be held in September, but it has now been brought forward to begin in August. At the same time, the air force will continue to send planes to French airspace for practice flights in July and August, and plans to conduct other exercises, in order to demonstrate the speed of progress in British air defense equipment and anti-aircraft gun teams. Although the detailed situation is still unknown, it must be widely publicized in advance, to show that this move by Britain has no meaning of panic and chaos, but has a warning nature. Only in this way can Germany clearly understand that an attack on Danzig will cause extremely serious consequences, and thus retreat in the face of difficulty. In addition, Colonel Schwerin, Director of the British Affairs Division of the German Ministry of Defense and military expert, recently came to England for a visit. He is said to have been deeply impressed by the strength of the British Air Force and the effectiveness of the anti-aircraft gun teams. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Franco Fetes Italian Foreign Minister: Franco to Visit Italy in September</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to news received here today from Madrid, General Franco has accepted an invitation from Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and is scheduled to visit Rome in September. On his way back, he may also accept an invitation from Hitler to visit Berlin. Italian sources in Madrid also said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has stated that if Franco visits Rome, he may later visit Madrid in return. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>San Sebastian, Spain. General Franco hosted Italian Foreign Minister Ciano at the San Telmo Palace last night. Invited to accompany him were members of the cabinet, as well as the ambassadors of Germany, Italy, and the Holy See. The gathering was grand and unprecedented. At the end of the banquet, General Franco delivered a welcoming speech, stating that Italy's attitude during the Spanish Civil War was more bright and sincere than other countries that hoped that both sides of the civil war would be harmed, and then reap the benefits. He expressed his gratitude on behalf of the Spanish nation. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>British Military Expenditure: £730 Million: Budget Passed by the House of Commons: Expresses Determination to Uphold Freedom</h3>
<p>(London) During a discussion of the budget in the House of Commons today, Finance Minister Simon stated that the total budget for national defense expenditures this year was previously £580 million, and it was possible that it would increase to £630 million. But in reality, it will now be £730 million. The amount to be borrowed will now reach £500 million, whereas the original plan was £380 million. He believes that issuing treasury bills to raise £150 million is possible. Only a portion of this year's expenses can be covered by current debt. Therefore, at the appropriate time, it is necessary to ask general investors, regardless of size, to actively purchase new national defense bonds. What other country in the world can find £900 million from daily taxes from the accounts owned by Britain? The remaining £500 million borrowed is an amazing figure. The Labor Party's motion of opposition was defeated by 206 votes to 141 votes. The case was passed on its third reading. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The House of Commons held a meeting today and passed the Finance Bill by a vote of 206 to 141 on its third reading, stipulating that the budget for the fiscal year 1939-40 totals £1.4 billion, of which £900 million should be taken from the state's current revenue, and the income tax rate and other tax rates should be increased to supplement it. The remaining £500 million will be raised by issuing public bonds. The largest expenditure item is national defense expenditure, totaling £730 million. Before the bill was submitted for a vote, Finance Minister Simon attended to explain it and provide reasons for the national defense expenditure, stating, "Our people have all made up their minds that no matter what changes occur in the future, we must have a way to maintain freedom, security, and national strength." Responsible individuals recently stated that the total amount of public bonds issued within this fiscal year can reach a huge £800 million, and the budget required for the next fiscal year is £500 million. Only £200 million of public bonds have been issued so far, and another £600 million can be issued, which is fully sufficient for use. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>Soviet-Mongolian Joint Forces Announce Situation on Outer Mongolian Border: Fighting Temporarily Suspended East of the Khalkhyn Gol River: Approximately 3,000 Japanese and Manchukuo Troops Killed in Action: Over 100 Japanese Planes Shot Down</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Semi-official sources recently received news from the General Staff of the Outer Mongolian and Soviet troops, stating that the Soviet-Mongolian and Japanese-Manchukuo troops had engaged in intermittent fighting from the 6th to the 12th of this month at Nomonhan and Buthaobo, east of the Khalkhyn Gol River. Previously, the Soviet-Mongolian troops had launched a fierce counterattack on July 5th, driving the Japanese-Manchukuo troops out of Outer Mongolian territory. However, on the morning of July 8th, Japanese-Manchukuo reinforcements arrived, carrying many tanks, heavy artillery, and aircraft, and launched an offensive on the east bank of the Khalkhyn Gol River, invading Outer Mongolian territory. From then until July 12th, fierce battles occurred from time to time on the east bank of the river. The Soviet-Mongolian troops, covered by bomber escorts, repeatedly repelled the enemy and defended their positions. In total, 3,000 Japanese-Manchukuo troops were killed in action, over 3,500 were wounded, and 254 were captured. The Soviet-Mongolian troops captured 4 cannons, 4 tanks, 15 armored vehicles, and 70 machine guns. The Soviet-Mongolian side had 293 killed and 653 wounded. In addition, air battles occurred from July 6th to 12th in the skies over Lake Buir and Nomonhan and Buthaobo. The Soviet-Mongolian aircraft lost 11 aircraft, and 61 Japanese aircraft were shot down, with 12 pilots captured. From May 8th to July 12th, the Soviet-Mongolian aircraft had a total of 52 aircraft destroyed, and as many as 199 Japanese aircraft were shot down. As for the Japanese side's claim that the Soviet-Mongolian troops used poison gas and toxins during the fighting, the General Staff of the Soviet-Mongolian troops denounced it as a complete fabrication, intended to slander.

<h3>Soviet Newspaper Publishes Accurate Mongolian-Manchurian Border: Based on Chinese Postal Map</h3>
<p>(Moscow) A Soviet newspaper recently published a map of the Lake Buir region and made the following comments: "In order to justify their provocations and seizure actions against the Mongolian People's Republic, the Japanese and Manchurian authorities have designated the Khalkhyn Gol River in official announcements as the border between the Mongolian People's Republic and Manchuria east and southeast of Lake Buir. According to official maps, the actual Mongolian-Manchurian border in that area does not run along the Khalkhyn Gol River. The accurate border is actually along the Kdulat-Vliin-Obo and Nomonhan-Butha-Obo line east of the river. This point is confirmed by the Chinese Postal Map, Map 43 (printed in Beijing in 1919). Since the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic, the border of the Mongolian People's Republic has been set in that area. Before the current incident occurred, the Japanese-Manchurian side had not raised any objections to the Mongolian-Manchurian border east of the Khalkhyn Gol River. The claim by the Japanese-Manchurian side that the border runs along the Khalkhyn Gol River is not supported by any official documents. This statement is purely fabricated. The purpose of this new invention by the Japanese army is to justify their provocations and seizure actions. (TASS dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>The Soviet Army Fights Bravely: Japan Admits Defeat: Japanese Army Officer Talks About the Situation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Army Captain Nohara, returned to this place from the "Manchukuo" Outer Mongolia front line earlier this week. He praised extremely the combat strength of the Soviet army that fought with the Japanese army in the Nomonhan area. He said, "The Soviet army possesses frightening firepower, the Soviet artillery is very good, and there are huge tank formations. The infantry charges very fiercely. Every time they charge, they are accompanied by fifty or sixty Soviet tanks. When they advance, it is like the waves of a storm. When the first batch of tanks is destroyed by our (that is, the Japanese side from now on, the same below) flat-trajectory guns, the first batch of tanks will continue straight toward our army. Our flat-trajectory guns are very effective in shooting. Every three shots fired, one Soviet tank is seen destroyed. Our infantry throw gasoline at the Soviet tanks, resulting in the burning of many tanks. I was initially surprised that our army on the front line needed hundreds of empty soda and beer bottles. After investigation, I learned that these empty bottles were used to hold gasoline to attack Soviet tanks. Soviet bombers are not up to the task, but the machine gunners are skilled at shooting ground troops. I think that the Soviets will soon use more effective aircraft. The weather on the front line is bad. During the day, it is hot up to 130 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, but at night it is very cold. I participated in the Guangzhou campaign, and the weather there was not as bad as in Manchuria and Mongolia, and we had a lot of canned drinks. On the northern plains, I felt a lack of drinks. After returning to Hailar, I found drinking water to be particularly delicious. There are many mosquitoes in the north, like Soviet planes, and they seem to be carrying heavy bombs."

<h3>Difficulties Remain in Anglo-Franco-Soviet Talks</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the matter of an Anglo-Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement, a certain prominent figure in the Conservative Party here recently declared that Poland and Turkey are the cornerstones of the anti-aggression front. In the event of war, they will surely receive assistance from the Soviet Union. This aspect is the most important area where the Soviet Union can contribute. Therefore, the formal entry of the Soviet Union into the anti-aggression front is not a critical issue, as the key lies with them, not with us. As for the ongoing Anglo-Franco-Soviet negotiations, if the Soviet side does not satisfy its own desires and refuses to compromise on the views of Britain and France, then successful negotiations are unlikely. The current obstacles encountered include the following two: (1) the problem of defining "indirect aggression." According to the Soviet view, it may intervene in the internal affairs of the Baltic states in the future, which is unacceptable to the British government. However, it hopes to find a way to protect these countries while preserving their independence and neutrality. (2) The Soviet Union insists on establishing a military agreement before formally signing a mutual assistance agreement, which would delay an agreement of a general nature and is therefore not the proper approach. Conversely, technical talks should be based on the completion of political negotiations. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Pittman Proposes Ban on Arms Shipments to Japan; US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Begins Discussion; Tokyo Expresses Resentment</h3>
<p>(Washington) Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, yesterday introduced a bill authorizing the President to prohibit the shipment of arms, ammunition, kerosene, and various metals and metal mixtures to countries that violate the Nine-Power Treaty (referring to Japan). The bill is scheduled for discussion tomorrow and is being taken very seriously by diplomatic circles here. Supporters of the bill claim that this measure is not to be implemented immediately, but is rather a diplomatic weapon to exert pressure on Japan. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to pass it, but discussions on foreign policy that involve neutrality issues will be extremely heated, as can be foreseen. Furthermore, diplomatic circles are still unaware of what the government will do regarding the repeal of arms embargo provisions. Political circles say that the President may not directly apply to Congress, but will publicly issue a statement explaining the government's attitude towards neutrality and clarifying that the current neutrality laws must be revised before the outbreak of war. At that point, Congress can resolve various legislative issues related to domestic affairs and adjourn, and if international circumstances require it, the President can reconvene Congress within the shortest possible time. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Political circles here today declared that if the United States bans arms exports to Japan, Japan may take some kind of economic retaliatory measures to counter it. Regarding the proposal submitted by Senator Pittman, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, authorizing the President to prohibit any military supplies from being exported to Japan, well-informed sources in Tokyo do not believe that this bill can pass in both houses. They assert that if the United States believes that this can reduce Japan's war-making capabilities, then it is mistaken. Japan and "Manchukuo's" arms industries are advancing rapidly. If the United States implements arms embargo legislation against Japan, it will only strengthen Japan's development of its own military industries. As for oil, Japan is not afraid either. As long as Japan controls the western Pacific, the supply of oil will not be scarce. Moreover, Japan can take certain economic measures to retaliate against the United States, such as stopping the import of 300 million yen worth of American goods each year. At the same time, there are other measures whose result would be to make general relations between the United States and Japan tense. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<h3>White House Issues Official Statement: No Discrepancies in Government's Views on Neutrality Law</h3>
<p>(Washington) A certain American news agency yesterday issued a message stating that there were discrepancies between President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull regarding how the government should act to prompt the Senate to reconsider the issue of revising the Neutrality Law. The White House has issued a public announcement personally signed by the President to various newspapers to deny this, stating, "The news agency has issued a message to various newspapers stating, 'It is heard from government officials that there are discrepancies between President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull regarding how to phrase the message that President Roosevelt intends to send to Congress on the issue of the Neutrality Law.' The headline used by the Washington Times-Herald also stated that the President and Secretary of State disagree on the details of the Neutrality Law issue. In fact, this headline has absolutely no accurate basis, and the message issued by the agency is also not factual. This concerns national policy and should be warned against. It is hoped that newspaper readers will heed this warning. In the past, this news agency has issued inaccurate messages, and this President and the secretaries of the White House have repeatedly urged them to pay attention. Now, they are fabricating facts and escalating their past actions, reaching the extreme of absurdity. It is hoped that public opinion will pay attention to this. Various false messages do not need to be denied one by one by the White House, but in this particular matter, anyone who respects themselves would find it intolerable. Therefore, this President is making this statement in the form of a public announcement and specifically naming the news agency to prevent American newspapers and other news agencies from being lumped together with it." (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement to various newspapers, stating that he is studying with President Roosevelt and the majority leaders of Congress how to resubmit the issue of revising the Neutrality Law for discussion. It is rumored that there are disagreements between him and the President regarding how to prompt Congress to express its attitude, but this is not the case. (It is rumored that the President intends to submit a message of a threatening nature to Congress, but Secretary of State Hull believes that it may not be effective, and there are discussions about their differing opinions.) (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Polish Loan to Be Established Soon</h3>
<p>(London) Financial circles here recently declared that the financial agreement between Britain, France, and Poland will be signed and established within days. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, economic advisor to the British government, held a final discussion this morning with representatives of the French and Polish governments. The basic terms of the agreement have been finalized and have been submitted to their respective governments for approval. Generally speaking, the Polish government's reply can be delivered here by tomorrow morning. According to well-informed sources, the main points of the agreement are to lend Poland a credit line of £17 million, part of which will be allocated from the British Export Credits Guarantee Department, and the other part will be equally shared by Britain and France to lend to Poland jointly. It is said that the Polish government originally wanted to borrow £40 million, and this £17 million may be the first tranche. If the Polish government has further needs for expanding its military preparations in the future, Britain and France will continue to lend them funds. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph's diplomatic correspondent reported that the British government will contribute £5 million and the French government £3.5 million to the fund for stabilizing Polish finances, so that Poland can put its troops in a state of mobilization. Britain will also expand its credit line to Poland to £8 million so that Poland can purchase raw materials for military supplies. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>Danzig Nazi Party Leader Holds Lengthy Talks with Hitler</h3>
<p>Danzig A public announcement was issued here today stating that Nazi Party leader Forster and Czyrski yesterday met with German Chancellor Hitler and talked for two and a half hours, discussing the Danzig situation. It is said that Forster reported on the Danzig situation and discussed the speech made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons on Monday. Forster and others are expected to return to Danzig today. Hitler instructed them to convey his greetings to the citizens of the Free City. According to non-official sources, Germany has instructed Danzig to make various preparations, and there may be concrete developments soon. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<h3>US President Orders Expedited Construction of Naval Air Bases; Pravda Urges Soviet Government Authorities to Pay Attention to the Military Importance of the Bering Sea</h3>
<p>(New York) President Roosevelt recently issued an order to expedite the construction of naval aviation bases in the following locations: (A) two locations in the Pacific Ocean: (1) Palmyra Atoll, (2) Howland Island, (3) Midway Island; (B) two locations near Alaska: (1) Kodiak Island, (2) Sitka. President Roosevelt believes that these bases are of great importance to national defense, so he ordered the abolition of the eight-hour workday in order to complete the construction as soon as possible. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Authorities here declared that the Soviet government has not paid sufficient attention to the military importance of the Bering Sea and the sea route through the Bering Strait between the Pacific Ocean. Balaschov, director of the Bering Sea Navigation Bureau, published an article in Pravda today, declaring that the experimental period has ended and that actual development of the Bering Sea route should begin. At the same time, the navy should be trained so that the entire fleet can safely navigate the Arctic Ocean. (Haitong, 14th)</p>

<h3>On the Eve of Anglo-Japanese Negotiations, Anti-British Movement Held in Tokyo; Mass Rally Held in Hibiya Park; Demonstration March to the British Embassy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) A mass anti-British rally was held in Hibiya Park today, with 50,000 participants. Afterwards, about 15,000 people, carrying banners with anti-British slogans, marched to the British Embassy with a musical band leading the way. The Japan Times pointed out that this was the largest demonstration against any foreign country in Japan. At 1:30 p.m., the demonstrators arrived at the British Embassy and saw that the gate was closed and that 500 Japanese police officers were lined up in three rows to provide protection. About 4,000 violent elements threw bricks and banners with anti-British slogans into the embassy compound, repeatedly trying to break in and shouting cheers at the speakers who were inciting the crowd to rush into the embassy, but they were prevented by the police from doing so. The police twice used motorcycles to stop the crowd from breaking through the gate. Most of the demonstrators wore the military uniforms of veterans' associations, and there was one leader wearing a naval uniform. The police initially only tried to prevent them from rushing into the embassy, but after a quarter of an hour, they had to persuade the demonstrators to disperse. As for the staff of the British Embassy, they continued to work as usual, without any signs of disturbance. The resolutions passed at today's anti-British rally included a scathing condemnation of Britain as an enemy of justice and humanity. One hundred and forty members of the Tokyo prefectural and municipal councils divided into five groups and visited Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, the Ministers of the Army and Navy, and British Ambassador Craigie to deliver the resolutions. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita, after informing the Emperor of the fundamental policies for the Anglo-Japanese negotiations approved by the cabinet, convened a four-and-a-half-hour meeting of senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last night to discuss the various situations that may arise during the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. Currently, national attention is focused on the preliminary talks between Arita and British Ambassador Craigie. The Asahi Shimbun commented on these preliminary talks, saying that if the British side does not show sincerity in changing its Far East policy, then efforts to resolve secondary issues such as the Tianjin incident will definitely fail. It is heard that both English and Japanese will be used during the talks. Currently, the staff of the British Embassy are working actively to cope with the great pressure they will encounter. This morning, three Japanese delegations went to the British Embassy to deliver protests against British East Asia policy. In the afternoon, after the mass rally in Hibiya Park, they marched to the British Embassy. Secretary Brian of the British Embassy received five Japanese representatives, who presented a lengthy resolution in the name of seven million citizens of Tokyo, demanding that Britain return its concessions to China and withdraw from the Far East. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today at a press conference that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has asked British Ambassador Craigie to meet with Arita at the Foreign Minister's official residence tomorrow morning for preliminary talks before holding a formal meeting on the Tianjin situation. The spokesperson declined to announce the details of the preliminary talks, saying that newspaper reports were purely speculative. When a reporter asked whether the decisions of the Anglo-Japanese conference would have a binding effect on the Japanese army in North China, the spokesperson replied that the negotiations were being held by the two governments. When asked whether the "provisional government" in North China was bound by this decision, the spokesperson replied, "The 'provisional government' has nothing to do with this negotiation." The spokesperson also replied to a reporter's question that the anti-British rallies across the country were purely spontaneous. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>The Future of Anglo-Japanese Negotiations is Bleak</h3>
<p>(London) Official sources here have not yet received formal information about the opening date of the Anglo-Japanese conference in Tokyo. Official sources are keeping silent about the possibility of Britain protesting to Japan about the anti-British movement in Qingdao, but the general impression is that Britain will warn the Japanese government of the impact of this anti-British riot on the Tokyo conference. The Daily Herald reported that if the demands made by Japan to Britain are as stated in the Japanese semi-official news, then these negotiations will be in darkness from the start. The Daily Mail said that Japan's war against China has failed. If we refuse to cooperate with them in China, Japan will not have the problem of fighting against Britain. If Japan risks doing so, then we can destroy its economic structure, but Japan will not push its demands to this point. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>American Authorities Closely Monitoring</h3>
<p>(Washington) Diplomatic circles here are paying close attention to the anti-British movement that is sweeping across Japan, believing that it is completely instigated by the Japanese government. Since the Japanese government is still able to control the parliament, it is not possible that it lacks the ability to control these activities. Therefore, diplomatic circles generally believe that the Anglo-Japanese negotiations will not have good results. In other words, after the failure of the Anglo-Japanese conference, the general interests of foreigners in the Far East will obviously deteriorate. Therefore, it is recognized here that due to the deterioration of the situation, the US Senate may change its attitude and tend to adopt Pittman's proposal to ban the export of arms to violators of the Nine-Power Treaty. (Associated Press, 14th)</p>
<h3>Tokyo Newspaper Comments on Threats to Britain</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The "Japan Times," which has close ties to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published an editorial today commenting on the future Anglo-Japanese talks, declaring that if the Anglo-Japanese talks do not take into account the general sentiment of the Japanese people, then there is no hope of any success. Japan has mobilized more than one million people and spent more than one billion yen to establish a "new order" in the Far East. Diplomatic negotiations that do not take these facts into account will inevitably fail completely. Political circles attach great importance to this editorial, as the newspaper has always advocated Anglo-Japanese understanding. Now, on the eve of the start of the negotiations, it has also published such strong remarks, which reflects the views of the Japanese officialdom. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<h3>Ambassador Kerr Remains on Duty; British Officialdom Denies Japanese Rumors</h3>
<p>(London) Official sources here deny the Japanese rumors that British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Kerr has resigned and that his resignation has been approved, saying that this statement is purely a fabrication and has no basis whatsoever. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>US Purchase Price of Foreign Silver Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Treasury Department reduced the purchase price of foreign silver to 35 cents per ounce a few days ago. Today, it maintained this price and announced that it would not change it for the time being. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Bombay The current strength of the Bombay silver market is mostly due to active replenishment by the short side. In the past half month, the mainland has absorbed an average of 160 bars of spot silver per day, but this number cannot be sustained for long during the monsoon season at current prices. According to well-informed sources, silver prices have now risen, and if the United States does not support them, market prices will inevitably gradually fall. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Japan's "Anti-British" Activities in North China Aim to Monopolize the Market; Poorly Written Leaflets Posted Throughout the Streets; Generally Recognized as Worthless</h3>
<p>The Zilin Daily's North Ping Communication of July 6 stated: The reporter was seized by a whim, spending the entire morning studying the anti-British leaflets distributed by the Japanese in Ping. The reporter had various experiences with Japanese propaganda, knowing in advance that it was a pure waste of effort. The Japanese propaganda is ineffective worldwide, and often causes the exact opposite of what they intend to promote. It is difficult to imagine something more foolish than these anti-British leaflets. The wording and content are laughable, and more harmful to the Japanese than to the British. First, the leaflets are written in very clumsy Chinese, with many sentences that are difficult to understand. They often use very obscure words that passers-by would not know. It is easy to find Japanese-style Chinese in the leaflets, with a "de" after every word. Why can't the Japanese leave this work to experienced Chinese people? The wording makes it seem written first by the Japanese, then translated word for word with a dictionary, or at least written by the Chinese, then edited by the Japanese. The content is childish and ridiculous. Besides criticizing Britain for helping General Chiang Kai-shek and protecting evil people in the British concession, the other crimes of Britain are just cursing. The Opium War is mentioned, but only in passing. This is not surprising, since the trade in drugs is the most prosperous business in North China today. The conclusions of the leaflets are just rampant abuse. The authors must have gotten so upset that they became disheartened and called out to "unite together to oppose British activities." The leaflets are unfocused, shallow, and odd. As anti-British propaganda, they are worthless, but as anti-Japanese propaganda, they are very effective. The Japanese are broadly advertising Anglo-Soviet aid to General Chiang Kai-shek, and the reporter is surprised. Japanese soldiers should broadcast these accusations in Japan, because their army and navy still cannot conquer China after two years, and they need to find excuses to satisfy the Japanese people. Broadcasting this information will only excite the Chinese people and let them know that this is very helpful to the Japanese. The Chinese people know that the real government is led by General Chiang Kai-shek, not pro-Japanese leaders, so the Japanese are not benefiting from this anti-British propaganda.</p>
<p>The mainland newspaper reported that a certain foreigner, who had lived in Qingdao for a long time, recently came to Shanghai from North China. Yesterday, on the 12th, he told the reporter that the British Consulate and British banks in Qingdao were stoned and attacked, which was the direct result of anti-British instigation under the Japanese. The unfortunate events against British interests in Qingdao will continue to occur. The recent strike against the British was in the form of special shipping regulations, which use sanitation as a pretext to require ships from Hong Kong and other ports to Qingdao to be quarantined for 24 hours for inspection. One British ship was forced to stay there for three days before being allowed to disembark. Another anti-British means was initiated by the water supply bureau of the puppet regime of the islands, which stated that water would not be supplied to foreign houses in the coastal area this year. Most of these houses are owned by British Chinese from all over China. At the same time, the demonstrations in the city, which started in early June, have reached their "peak" in the past few weeks. In addition to hiring coolies to march, the Japanese forced all Chinese, Japanese and Russian newspapers to engage in this movement. The New People's Newspaper, controlled by the Japanese, recently urged its readers to implement the following eight procedures: (1) investigate all kinds of British goods; (2) use skin paper to print "Do not buy or sell British goods" and distribute leaflets with anti-British slogans; (3) make everyone stop buying and selling British goods; (4) implement and expand the anti-British movement; (5) write to other cities and encourage the public to hold anti-British conferences; (6) organize anti-British groups; (7) post anti-British slogans everywhere; (8) print a list of British goods and distribute it to the public so they know which items not to buy. On June 29, Qingdao was full of these slogans, and many were pasted on the walls of the British Consulate. At the entrance of the Japanese Residents Association, there was a large cloth banner with the words "Do not discuss business with British banks and businesses." The leaflets all attacked the British, such as "For the happiness of the Chinese people, British interests must be destroyed," "Britain must change its policy in China," "Britain hinders the establishment of a new order," "Eliminate British capital," "Britain must immediately stop supporting Chiang," and so on. On a certain day scheduled for the anti-British conference, the Japanese went door-to-door to mobilize the people to attend the conference. Some Japanese yarn factories took a half-day holiday and claimed that workers could attend.</p>
<h3>North China's People are Very Aware of the Close Relationship Between China and Britain; Most Do Not Participate in the "Anti-British" Activities Instigated by Some Party</h3>
<p>Tianjin Communication, some party is actively intensifying the "anti-British movement" in the occupied areas, attempting to post slogans, march and speak, and trying to incite. However, the true Chinese people have a deep understanding of the friendly friendship between China and Britain, and they have not been moved even in deep water. According to foreign travelers who have recently returned from various parts of North China, the situation in various places is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Beijing</p>
<p>Some party-run newspapers in North China continue to attack Britain, sparing no effort, and even claiming that they secretly supply bandits and disturb public security. However, the residents have long seen through their roles and do not believe them.</p>
<p>Qingdao</p>
<p>The demonstrations in front of the British Consulate a few days ago were all carried out by Japanese ruffians who gathered hooligans and were quickly stopped and dispersed. Anti-British slogans were pasted everywhere, but the Chinese people, considering the intentions of the instigators and the friendship with Britain, did not take action. Therefore, the effect was minimal.</p>
<p>Shanxi</p>
<p>A missionary returning from Shanxi talked about the anti-British movement in North China, which was clearly initiated by a certain party. In fact, it has been repeatedly discovered that certain party members have participated in the vandalism of church property and the intimidation of missionaries. Churches and chapels were plastered with anti-British symbols, and there were even proposals to return to the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. However, the public has a high level of knowledge, so they are not moved.</p>
<p>According to reports from those who have personally experienced various places this time, apart from the unstable elements bought by a certain party, taking advantage of the situation, (for example, in Xiamen, the Taiwanese overseas Chinese organized an anti-British comrades association), the Chinese people have no so-called anti-British sentiment. Because Britain has provided a lot of assistance to China's economic construction in recent years, they disdain such despicable acts and are unwilling to participate.</p>
<h3>Manchuria is Japan's Heavy Burden</h3>
<p>— Bo Ming</p>
<p>The author of the following article, using the pseudonym Guzo Hakwaisba, likely writing under a false name, elaborates in detail on how Japan has not gained even a small profit from seizing Manchuria, but instead has increased its heavy burden. This is indeed one of the major mistakes made by the militarists. He uses numbers to prove his arguments, which is not mere empty talk. From this, it can be seen that this time the militarists' war against China is repeating previous mistakes. The article was published in this issue of the *Millard's Review*, and is translated here, hoping it will be of interest to those who care about the current situation.</p>
<p>Translator</p>
<p>Japan's economic exhaustion has gradually arrived. Its cause is not only the current fighting south of the Great Wall of China but also the increasing burden faced by the Japanese militarists ruling Manchuria. When the war against China broke out in July 1937, Japan was already struggling due to the expenses in Manchuria, spending nearly 500 million yen annually for the past six years. Those expenses used for railways and various industries are listed as "investment," but this can only deceive fools. The railways built are mostly for military purposes, often running parallel to existing routes. Dividends paid are few, or even non-existent. For most of the railways, they are generally unlikely to ever be profitable unless some accounting tricks are used to make losses look like profits. However, these railways enable the Japanese army to transport troops from one area to another, constantly fighting against Chinese guerrillas. The new ports in northern Korea are used for the rapid deployment of Japanese troops from the mainland.</p>
<p>The railways are not only for military use against China but can also be used against the Soviet Union if necessary. The Japanese militarists, on the surface, bravely bluster and act arrogantly toward the Soviet Union, but secretly they are very afraid. Since being greatly alarmed last year and being forced to cede Zhanggufeng to the Soviet Union, the Japanese militarists have become even more fearful. To avoid being looked down upon by the Western powers and the Chinese, they are forced to maintain a provocative attitude. This is just empty talk, as they carefully avoid provoking a real war. "Border incidents" have occurred dozens of times. If the militarists really wanted war, each incident could be used as an excuse to launch an attack. However, the Japanese militarists certainly do not want to fight the Soviet Union. Fortunately for Japan, the Soviet Union also does not want to engage in direct, large-scale warfare with Japan.</p>
<h3>The Beginning of Soviet-Japanese Friction</h3>
<p>However, this friction with the Soviet Union is the most unfortunate result of Japan's actions. The deteriorating relations with the Soviet Union are the most foolish actions of the Japanese militarists. For several years after the establishment of the Soviet-Japanese Treaty in 1925, there were very friendly relations between the two governments. The friendship between the Soviet Union and Japan was most evident under the Japanese civilian governments from 1925 to 1927 and from 1929 to 1931, but the militarists also followed a friendly policy. When the Fengtian government tried to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway from the Soviet Union in 1929, the South Manchuria Railway refused to allow the Chinese side to use its railway lines and vehicles to transport troops against the Soviet Union. In early 1932, when the Japanese and Manchurian armies began to fight fiercely, the Soviet Union allowed the Japanese side to use the Chinese Eastern Railway to repay the previous favor. Army Minister Araki Sadao advocated a close and friendly understanding with the Soviet Union. The Kokumin Domei, the military fascist party of Adachi Kenzo, openly advocated a new Soviet-Japanese alliance. Friendly exchanges of officers between the Japanese and Soviet armies were also common for a long time, until they ended in 1938.</p>
<p>In 1933, Japan's attempt to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway destroyed the previous friendly relations with the Soviet Union. This was a truly foolish endeavor, and a direct result of the Japanese army's arrogance after invading Manchuria. Even before that, some Japanese militarists and diplomats excessively vilified the Soviet Union, constantly harming the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Japan. They naturally falsely claimed that Japan was the "bulwark against communism" in the Far East, creating a favorable impression on the dull conservatives in the West and gaining support for the Japanese militarists' aggression. In the West, Hitler used the same pretext to gain the support of the conservatives. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Overview of Higher Education Students Nationwide (2)</h3>
<p>Significant Decrease in Student Numbers After the Outbreak of War</p>
<p>Wartime Situation</p>
<p>Since the Lugouqiao Incident, Beiping, a city with cultural history, was first threatened. The fourteen universities and colleges in Beiping City failed to fully open. The seven universities and colleges in Tianjin and Baoding were soon destroyed. As the Shanghai war broke out and the war zone gradually expanded, most of the universities and colleges in Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, and the provinces and cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, and Tianjin, except for a few that tried to relocate or maintain operations with difficulty, were forced to shut down. The original sites of most schools were destroyed, and compatriots were displaced to other provinces. Due to the impact of the war, drastic changes occurred in the field of education. The increase or decrease in the number of students in universities and colleges in the 26th year of the Republic (1937) is very obvious. Except for some schools that have been suspended, such as National Shandong University, Provincial Anhui University, Provincial Shanxi University, Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology, Hebei Provincial Women's Normal College, Hebei Provincial Agricultural College, Hebei Provincial Medical College, Wusong Merchant Marine College, Shanxi Provincial Industrial College, Shanxi Provincial Commercial College, Shanxi Provincial Agricultural College, Shandong Provincial Rural Construction College, Beiping Municipal Physical Education College, Shanghai Municipal Physical Education College, and more than ten other schools, as well as schools where the survey was incomplete, such as Provincial Qiqin University, Private Qilu University, National Pharmaceutical College, and more than ten other schools, and four newly established and newly approved schools, where a comparison before and after is impossible, we can compare the number of students in the 25th year of the Republic (1936) with the number of students in the 26th year of the Republic (1937) in 70 schools such as National Central University to see the impact of the unprecedented catastrophe on Chinese culture. Among these 70 schools, those with an increase in the number of students in the 26th year compared to the 25th year were only National Wuhan University, Hunan University, Sichuan University, Yunnan University, Central University, Sun Yat-sen University, Northeastern University, Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College, Provincial Chongqing University, Guangxi University, Gansu College, Sichuan Provincial College, Private Datong University, Wuchang China University, Guangzhou University, West China Union University, Xiangya Medical College, Lianzuo Engineering College, Fujian College, Wuchang Art College, and Qunzhi Agricultural and Commercial College, a total of 21 schools. Among them, the schools with the largest increase in the number of students were National Yunnan University and Provincial Chongqing University, both exceeding the number of students in the 25th year by more than double. The next were National Sichuan University, Wuhan University, and Private Qunzhi Agricultural and Commercial College, all exceeding the number of students in the 25th year by more than nine-tenths. However, the number of schools with a decrease in the number of students in the 26th year is also alarming. Private Guanghua University and Wuxi National Studies College both decreased by more than five-sevenths of the number of students in the 25th year. Private Jinling University decreased by more than seven-tenths of the number of students in the 25th year. The number of students in National Southwest Associated University in the 26th year, compared with the former National Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Private Nankai University in the 25th year, and the number of students in National Northwest Associated University in the 26th year, compared with the former National Beiping University, Beiping Normal University, and National Beiyang Institute of Technology in the 25th year, both decreased by more than one-half. Others, such as Private Fudan University, Great China University, Ginling Women's College, Shanghai Law College, Shanghai Chih Tze College, Shanghai College of Law and Politics, Soochow University, Shanghai Art College, and Private Xinhua Art College, all had a decrease of more than one-half in the number of students in the 26th year compared to the number of students in the 25th year. In total, the 70 schools, including National Central University, had a total of 32,888 students in the 25th year and 25,746 students in the 26th year, a decrease of 7,142 students. Looking at the increase or decrease in the number of students in each school in the 26th year, it can be seen that inland schools, such as National Wuhan University, Hunan University, Sichuan University, Yunnan University, Provincial Guangxi University, Chongqing University, Private West China Union University, and Sichuan Provincial Education College, all had a sudden increase in the number of students. Schools that moved from the war zone to the interior, such as National Central University and Northeastern University, also had an increase in the number of students. On the contrary, schools in the war zone and schools that moved out of the war zone later had a sharp decrease in the number of students. From this, it can be inferred that the total number of university and college students nationwide in the 26th year must be less than that in the 25th year. During this incident, countless young people in China lost the opportunity to continue their studies due to their hometowns becoming war zones, displacement to other places, and economic hardship. This is not only China's misfortune but also a major obstacle to the development of world culture. However, the relocation of various schools has been settled in the 27th year, and the situation is better. The current academic year has just ended, and student statistics have not yet been compiled. Now, we can only compare the number of students in the 25th and 26th years.</p>
<h3>New Buildings for Refugee Children's Nurseries and Orphanages Approaching Completion; Fundraising via Radio Broadcast by Board Members</h3>
<p>Since its establishment in September of last year, the Shanghai Refugee Children's Nursery and Orphanage initially only accommodated 16 refugee children. Subsequently, with the enthusiasm of all sectors of society for sponsorship and adoption, and through the efforts of Chen Jicheng, the director of the orphanage, the number was continuously increased to 300. The orphanage's affairs are developing day by day, and the management is extremely effective.</p>
<p>The educational philosophy emphasizes both education and vocational skills training. The results of the implementation over the past year have been excellent, and all sectors of society have continued to provide assistance. Everything is being implemented step by step. Due to the small size of the orphanage's site, only simple and easy-to-implement vocational training can be carried out. Other major subjects cannot be offered. Therefore, the orphanage has found a site in Lane 258, Wuding Road, at the intersection of Mett Hess Road, in the Public Concession, to build 28 new orphanage buildings. Construction began in April of this year and is expected to be completed by the end of this month. The orphanage is now increasing the number of refugee children to the full quota of 500 and expanding vocational training. It will also attach a daycare center and a maternity hospital for refugee women, specifically for refugee women who cannot afford to raise their children, and provide care for their infants. However, the cost of various equipment is very high. With the increase in the number of children, the educational expenses have increased sharply. Even with the adoption of refugee children at six yuan per month for food and clothing, and the donation of educational expenses at two yuan per month per child, and the adoption of infants in daycare centers at ten yuan per month per child, monthly expenses will inevitably increase. Therefore, starting yesterday (the 14th), Yuan Ludeng, Xu Guanqun, Chen Jicheng, Tao Leqin, and others will broadcast fundraising appeals for the expansion of educational expenses on Tianchan Radio and Mingyuan Radio. Today (the 15th), Zhou Bangjun, Lin Kanghou, Lu Wenshao, and Yu Qiaqing will broadcast fundraising appeals on Sino-Western Radio and Friends Radio.</p>
<h3>Examination for the Seventh Session of Government-Funded Students Studying in the UK Extended to Three Days; Examination Site in Shanghai at Sino-Western Girls' High School</h3>
<p>The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Committee has decided to select 26 government-funded students to study in the UK for the seventh session this year. This year's academic focus is on industrial specialties. The examination date was originally scheduled for the 23rd and 24th of this month. However, because the number of applicants in Chongqing and Shanghai is much higher than in previous years, the examination date has been changed to the 23rd, 24th, and 25th, to be held separately. The examination venues in Chongqing, Kunming, Hong Kong, and Shanghai have been separately decided by the committee. The examination venue in Chongqing is Chongqing University, the examination venue in Kunming is Yunnan University, the examination venue in Hong Kong is Hong Kong University, and the examination venue in Shanghai is Sino-Western Girls' High School. The persons in charge in various places have begun active preparations. The committee has already internally decided on the invigilators and will formally announce them in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Four Universities in Chengdu Complete Enrollment in Shanghai; Examination Papers to be Graded in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Chengdu's Jinling University, Jinling Women's University, Qilu University, and West China University jointly enrolled new students in Shanghai this summer and completed the examinations on the 13th. The number of applicants was considered quite large, and there were eight or nine female students, indicating a good trend of Shanghai youth going to the interior. Initially, it was planned to seal the examination papers and send them to Chengdu for grading and announcement. However, because there were too many examination papers, it was inconvenient to send them by airmail and there was fear of loss, leaving no basis for grading. After a resolution in Chengdu, it was decided to hire Professors Bates, Liu Chongben, Huang Mingli, Tian Guansheng, Zhao Chuanjia, and others in Shanghai to grade the papers and determine the selection. At the same time, the admitted students can start their journey early. It is said that the results will be announced in Shanghai next week.</p>
<h3>Summer Classes at Refugee Relief Association's Free Primary Schools Suspended</h3>
<p>The summer remedial classes for refugee children's primary schools and various free primary schools affiliated with the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Education Department were scheduled to start on the 20th of this month. It is now learned that the refugee schools in the various reception centers of the association will still start classes on the original date, but the various free primary schools have been decided to be suspended due to various problems. Notifications have been sent separately. However, the establishment of free primary schools in the next semester is currently being planned for expansion.</p>
<h3>Job Opportunities for Specialized Talents from Schools</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, various levels of schools in the interior have moved to Shanghai to continue classes. However, they feel considerable difficulty in finding jobs for graduating students, making it difficult to recommend positions. This is a common concern for educators. It is learned that a certain large factory intends to expand due to business development and is specifically seeking: (1) engineers or technical instructors (capable of manufacturing motors, glass, nitric acid, sodium silicate, durable materials, candles, soap, etc.); (2) technicians (manufacturing machine tools, tools, and certain types of machinery, such as pipe making, brewing, textile machinery, etc.). The qualified technical talents must have received specialized education, have practical experience, and be able to work hard. Specialized school students who meet the above conditions and are interested in applying can bring two 2.5-inch headshots and supporting documents to Room 208, 2nd Floor, 80 Hualong Road, between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM and between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM every day for preliminary registration. Those who meet the requirements will be contacted for an interview. The future treatment is generous. This is truly good news for specialized talents seeking employment.</p>

<h3>Depositing in Foreign Banks - Economists Vigorously Refute the Fallacy - Buying Foreign Exchange is Especially Unwise - Investing in the Mainland is a Proper Method</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 13th. Since the Tianjin Concession incident, the Japanese puppets, in order to achieve their expected sinister goals, have spared no effort in creating various rumors to shake the minds of the Chinese people. The general public is inevitably deceived, resulting in a rush to withdraw deposits and buy foreign exchange in Shanghai. In order to stabilize the Shanghai financial market, the financial authorities have specially stipulated restrictions on withdrawals and deposits. Since the implementation of this method, the Shanghai financial market has stabilized. However, it is heard that a small number of depositors have not yet truly understood the interests of the country and themselves, and are still withdrawing money to deposit in foreign banks. A reporter met an economic expert yesterday and asked for his opinion. He made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Speculators Fabricate Rumors</p>
<p>Shanghai has long been established as the financial and commercial center of the country. Chinese and foreign merchants gather, and trade in various industries is prosperous. Speculators lurk among them, and they often fabricate rumors to seek profit, not only in speculating on foreign exchange. Considering the history of Shanghai for decades, the harm caused by capitalists and speculators manipulating rumors is countless. Moreover, recently, Japanese and puppet elements have been rampant in Shanghai, and their tricks of spreading rumors have been used to the extreme. Their intention is not only to disrupt China's finances but to destroy legitimate Chinese and foreign businesses. It is regrettable that the Chinese people are deceived by them.</p>
<p>Legal Tender is Solid, Foreign Exchange is Stable</p>
<p>However, China's legal tender is stable and will never be destroyed by rumor-mongers. Even if it is slightly affected for a while, it is like clouds obscuring the sun and moon. In an instant, the wind dissipates, the clouds scatter, and the sun and moon shine brightly. Similarly, managing foreign exchange is a necessary measure for a country during wartime. The Chinese government, for legitimate needs, still sells it at the statutory price of one shilling, two pence, and one-quarter once approved, and does not change due to the decline in speculative market prices. The fixed value of China's legal tender can be seen here. Furthermore, according to China's issuance system, 60% is cash reserve and 40% is security reserve. The high percentage of cash reserve is the highest in the world.</p>
<p>Actual Reserve Exceeds Japan</p>
<p>Although the foreign exchange position under the cash reserve is inevitably slightly in deficit due to the purchase of essential supplies for the war of resistance and the maintenance of the market, the foreign exchange reserves such as government purchases, foreign exchange settlements by exporters, collection of gold and silver, absorption of overseas remittances, and repeated loans from the United Kingdom and the United States have been enriched and increased one after another. According to various aspects of research, the current reserve situation is definitely not below the currency reserve of general countries, and it far exceeds Japan's reserve. Therefore, the credibility of the currency and the thickness of its strength compared with the legal tender of other countries are already obvious. Therefore, the general public who doubt the legal tender and compete to buy foreign exchange must be ignorant of the general trend of the world economy and have gone astray to reduce their own security, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks are Not Entirely Reliable</p>
<p>A part of the Chinese people, due to their low level of education, often neglect to examine the general economic situation of the world. Therefore, they lack judgment and self-confidence. They believe that foreign banks must be reliable. In fact, judging from the international situation and past history, depositing in foreign banks is definitely more harmful than beneficial. First of all, in terms of interest, foreign banks have meager interest rates, and sometimes even require handling fees. As for the safety issue, during the European War, the economies of various countries were extremely panic-stricken, and banks went bankrupt every day. Even the richest country in the world, the United States, has also suffered from the collapse of many banks due to economic panic. Now, the world situation is tense, and war is imminent. In the event of an unfortunate outbreak, the countries may have various management methods for bank funds. At that time, how can you withdraw money? Seeking perfection will only lead to damage, and there will be no time for regret. Moreover, citing past examples, the bankruptcy and suspension of foreign banks in China are also common. The victimized Chinese people want to get everything, but end up with nothing. We hope that people will seriously examine this point.</p>
<p>Domestic Banks Have Outstanding Credit</p>
<p>And to briefly talk about the benefits of depositing in domestic banks, based on the principle of safeguarding personal interests and increasing the strength of the war of resistance, it is most appropriate for Chinese people to deposit their funds in domestic banks. Although China's banking industry started relatively late, the government authorities' strict examination, the stability of the currency system, and the proper maintenance of national banks, the banks themselves, due to the layers of supervision in business, have to be extra cautious in their operations. In terms of interest rates, the spirit of mutual assistance among the Chinese people is also more generous than that of foreign banks. Moreover, the public can always pay attention to and understand the actual situation, and deposits are easily safe. In the two years of the war of resistance, thanks to the financial authorities' effective deployment, China's monetary system is strong, not only is the social finance stable as usual, and the national economy is unshakable, but it has not affected the interests of the people in the slightest, and it can do its best to protect depositors.</p>
<p>Buying Foreign Exchange is the Most Unwise</p>
<p>At present, some ignorant people are buying foreign exchange with legal tender that has consolidated credit, which is a pity because they are suffering losses for no reason. They do not know that the government still supplies foreign exchange at the statutory price for legitimate needs, and it can be purchased at any time as long as the reason is legitimate. Now, some people are exchanging foreign exchange at a market price of more than six pence with legal tender worth one shilling, two pence, and one-quarter. They are not only wrongfully reducing their financial resources by eight pence, but also losing their generous interest. There is nothing more unwise than this. Moreover, the market price of foreign exchange is volatile and changes at any time. Recalling the past 20 years, one pound sterling once converted into more than seven Chinese dollars, and one US dollar once converted into more than nine Chinese cents. Now that the world situation is critical, such past events may reappear. All my compatriots should learn from the past and know the future, why should they suffer this loss? I have to offer this advice based on what I have seen.</p>
<p>Investing in the Mainland Can Yield High Profits</p>
<p>Furthermore, now that the Japanese are blockading the ports, the production and construction enterprises in the rear are suddenly booming, and there are excellent opportunities for the use of national capital. If they can invest in the mainland's production enterprises, not only can they obtain high profits for themselves, but also make the entire financial system active, and their contribution to the country and the nation is no less than that of the soldiers at the front. Now that the war of resistance has reached the final stage, and the path to national survival and final victory has been taken for the most part, how should our compatriots complete this great task and lay the foundation for this peaceful and prosperous life? It is extremely important. From the perspective of economics, I hope that the people of the country will pay attention to the loss and danger of transferring deposits to foreign banks and buying foreign exchange. I dare not remain silent, and I will not be bothered by trivial matters. I will briefly offer a word of advice to my compatriots.</p>
<h3>Zhoujiazui Island - Foreigners' Property Completely Destroyed - The Japanese Side Only Agrees to Compensate for a Portion of the Loss - Only 13% of the Original Property Value</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, foreigners who formerly resided on Zhoujiazui Island, are still hoping for compensation from the Japanese side for the seizure and destruction of their property on the island. Recent meetings have continued to consider the Japanese side's offer to compensate for a portion of the loss. It is reported that some Germans residing on the island have accepted only a portion of the compensation for their losses, but others are unlikely to do so. The Japanese side's offer does not include movable property, and the value of movable property is the largest in various compensation claims. Several foreigners have seen military trucks transport movable property. All items in the bungalows of foreigners residing on the island, including refrigerators and automobiles, were seized by Japanese soldiers. Those that were not taken away were destroyed. The Japanese side's offer also does not include ships. One of them, formerly the fire boat of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, has recently been seen being used by the Japanese military as a scrap ship. When the war broke out, there were quite a few foreigners residing on the island, and there were beautiful bungalows and cottages sufficient for living. Relatively speaking, the cost of building these houses was not high. The valuable part of the property was decorations, furniture, and personal items. Many of them had electricity, refrigerators, and radios. And personal items were all placed in bungalows. It is reported that the current offer from the Japanese side is only for "immovable property" that was confiscated and used, not for the items that were seized in October of the previous year. The compensation price requested by the foreigners is calculated in gold pounds. According to the current exchange rate, the Japanese side's offer is only 13% of the property value. It is found that the foreigners withdrew from the island around August 17 and 18 of the previous year. Later, some of them managed to return to the island to retrieve a few items and found that their property was still intact. However, since the beginning of October, foreigners saw three Japanese military trucks, under the command of (military officers), carrying furniture and personal items. They confirmed that their property was also being transported. When they questioned the Japanese military officers about this, they replied that they were very sorry for the slight misconduct of their subordinates and would strictly restrain them in the future. Later, Major General Simalett, commander of the British army stationed in Shanghai, arranged for foreigners to visit the island. He had obtained a pass signed by the Japanese army and navy authorities here. However, the foreigner's party, with a total of 50 cars, was blocked by a Japanese acting sergeant at the Dinghai Road Bridge. A certain foreigner's car arrived there earlier and managed to drive past the Japanese sentry and arrived at his bungalow. He saw two Japanese soldiers using bayonets to pierce his boxes and take all the items in the boxes in front of the foreigner. Then, they politely bowed to the foreigner and left. Soon, a Japanese patrol soldier arrested the foreigner, escorted him to the mainland, and detained him for one and a half hours. After deciding that he was not a dangerous person, they sent him back to the bungalow. When he returned, the foreigner found that his car had been stolen when he was detained. In the middle of this year, the Japanese side allowed a group of foreigners on the island to inspect their property. They saw a tragic scene on the island. The bungalows were dilapidated and there was nothing complete. All that was left were pieces of paper and personal photos. A certain foreigner's wartime command power and medals were also lost. It is heard that the Japanese side once claimed that the foreigner's movable property was taken away by the Chinese, but the foreigners knew that everything was done by the Japanese army. However, the foreigners decided to leave the island at that time. The newspaper office submitted a request for full compensation for all property according to the exchange rate of 14 pence per pound.</p>

<h3>Unified Discount Payment - Securities Rebound Sharply - Shanghai's Six Installment Payments Changed to Remittance - Date Set for Eighth Principal Repayment Lottery - Government Maintains Creditworthiness and All Sectors Admire</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance issued a notice on January 15 regarding the method of repayment of various customs-guaranteed debts, in order to maintain creditworthiness, it transferred to the four banks, Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong, to discount the principal and interest due on the seventh installment of the unified public debt due at the end of July and pay it in Chongqing. Shanghai and other ports will handle it in six installments. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cash Payment in Chongqing</p>
<p>The four banks, Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong, are willing to handle the principal and interest of the five types of bonds, A, B, C, D, and E, of the "Unified" Public Debt due at the end of July. After the discount payment is made, all payment methods have been formulated. From July 31, the Central Bank of China's Chongqing head office and its entrusted China and Communications banks will make payments. Shanghai and other places will be paid in six installments, each installment lasting one month. It is heard that Chongqing will pay in full, and in cash. In Shanghai, because it has fallen, in order to prevent the inflow of huge amounts of legal tender, it is heard that it will be changed to remittance. This remittance is the Shanghai universal remittance note.</p>
<p>Payment Method</p>
<p>When the bondholder applies for the principal and interest payment, he should fill in the application form for the discount voucher. The number of bonds to be received in each period should be calculated to the nearest cent. If the number of bonds is less than one cent, it should be included in the sixth period for calculation. For example, a ten-dollar interest coupon of the unified public debt should be paid two jiao, eight fen, and five li. Averaging it by six, the value of each period is four fen and seven and a half li. The five seven and a half li from the first to the fifth period are included in the sixth period for calculation. Then the first five periods should be paid four fen, and the last period should be paid eight fen and five li. It is also stipulated that one form should be filled out for each household, with the household name as the unit.</p>
<p>Handled by Three Banks</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound News Agency inquired with the banking sector yesterday and learned that after the four banks, Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong, discounted the seventh installment of the unified public debt due for payment, regarding the payment agency, according to Article 8 of the regulations, "The repayment of principal and interest of this public debt is designated to be managed by the Central Bank of China and its entrusted Bank of China and Communications Bank." The public debt ticket is divided into four types: five thousand yuan, one thousand yuan, one hundred yuan, and ten yuan. The interest rate is set at 6% per year. The repayment period is 12 years for type A, 15 years for type B, 18 years for type C, 21 years for type D, and 24 years for type E.</p>
<p>Eight Lotteries</p>
<p>The National Debt Fund Management Committee has stipulated the dates for the eighth lottery for the repayment of principal of the five types of unified public debt, A, B, C, D, and E. (1) Type A, August 10, 25 draws, principal repayment of 3.75 million yuan. (2) Type B, September 10, 10 draws, principal repayment of 1.5 million yuan. (3) Type C, October 9, 8 draws, principal repayment of 1.75 million yuan. (4) Type D, November 10, 8 draws, principal repayment of 4.4 million yuan. (5) Type E, December 10, 8 draws, principal repayment of 2.08 million yuan. The payment date is January 31 of next year. The interest payment for the eighth installment of the five types totals 41.90016 million yuan.</p>
<p>Price Soars</p>
<p>In the Shanghai securities gray market, due to the Ministry of Finance's maintenance of creditworthiness, the unified debt due at the end of July was discounted and paid by the four banks, and the various unified debt rebounded sharply. The price has stabilized since yesterday. At the close, unified type A was 50 yuan, eight jiao, and five fen, up six jiao and five fen; type B was 50 yuan, three jiao, and five fen, up five jiao and five fen; type C was 48 yuan and eight jiao, up five jiao; type D was 48 yuan and five fen, up four jiao and five fen; type E was 48 yuan and five jiao, up six jiao and five fen. It is also heard that the unified debt is the most circulating in the Chinese domestic debt market.</p>
<p>Order Arrives Soon</p>
<p>Regarding the repayment of principal and interest of the unified public debt, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency inquired again with the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank of China yesterday. Although it has not received a formal order from the Ministry of Finance, the method reported yesterday is confirmed to be reliable. Also, the discount payment method of the four banks, Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong, was formulated by the Central Bank of China in Shanghai. However, private parties have received telegrams from Chongqing and Hong Kong to confirm it. It is heard that the official order from the Ministry of Finance will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. Also, the payment of the Restoration Public Debt due on August 31 will be announced by the ministry at that time.</p>
<h3>Collateral for Foreign Exchange Transfer and Withdrawal: Hiring Experts for Evaluation; Dividing into Three Groups: Real Estate, Securities, and Goods; Establishing an Inspection Committee for Implementation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Joint Reserve Association will begin handling foreign exchange transfer and withdrawal matters for fellow banks from July 4th. Various banks and firms have successively provided collateral, which will be reviewed and evaluated by the association. Based on 70% of the evaluated value, they can withdraw foreign exchange transfers from the association. This collateral is divided into (1) major goods, (2) marketable securities and stocks, and (3) profitable real estate within the concessions. Experts are hired for the evaluation of each type of collateral. The association originally had an evaluation committee consisting of three groups: real estate, securities and stocks, and goods. Recently, due to the expansion of affairs, more evaluation committee members have been hired for each group, making the organization more complete. A Foreign Exchange Transfer Reserve Inspection Committee has also been established, holding at least one inspection meeting per month and publicly announcing the inspection reports at any time to show credibility. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Three Groups of Committee Members</p>
<p>List of Evaluation Committee Members: (1) Real Estate Group: Chairman Qian Xin Zhi, Committee Members C.F. Wolsiffer (Director of China Trading Company), A.W. Buck (Manager of Yekuang Real Estate Company), R.D.K. Silby (Chairman of the Shanghai Real Estate Appraisers and Surveyors Association), Li Shuming (Manager of the Central Savings Society), Li Shuxiong (Director of Fangsheng Industrial Company); Evaluation Advisors: W.A. Adams, Hugosandor of China Trading Company, former General Manager of Puyi Real Estate Company. (2) Securities and Stocks: Chairman Bei Songsun, Committee Members Ye Fuxiao (Manager of Continental Bank), C.D. Culbertson (Sinfeng Trading Company), Ellis Hayim (Lian Trading Company), Yuan Qiuchu (Hesheng Trading Company). (3) Goods Group: Chairman Tang Shoumin, Committee Members Wu Shenbo (Manager of Ruilun Silk Factory), Sun Zhongli (Manager of Fufeng Flour Company), Tang Xinghai (Manager of Qingfeng Textile Factory), Cao Xingeng (Manager of Xinfeng Grain Store), Tong Runfu (Manager of Xinyu Yarn Factory), Shen Jinzhou (Manager of Yitaixing Coal Yard), Zhou Desun (Deputy Manager of Four Banks Savings Society); Evaluation and Inspection Advisors: Ruihe Trading Company, Yizhong Notary Public.</p>
<p>Establishing Inspection Committee</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the four major banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China), the Foreign Banks Association, the Banking Association, and the Money Exchange Association, and other five groups, each nominate one representative to form the Foreign Exchange Transfer Reserve Inspection Committee. The committee members are Xu Jiyin, Hu Meian, H.C. Hopkins, Qin Runqing, and Wu Yunzhai. They have already implemented inspections according to the inspection rules. The committee stipulates that it will conduct at least one inspection per month on the collateral received by the Reserve Association from various banks and firms for foreign exchange transfer withdrawals, and will publicly announce the withdrawal amount and the types and amounts of collateral separately. The committee has hired accountant Pan Xulun as accounting consultant.</p>
<h3>Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank: Auxiliary Currency Notes Issued Under Ministry Order; One-Fen and Five-Fen Notes Being Printed; One-Jiao and Two-Jiao New Notes Already in Circulation; Collective Purchase of Stamps by Exchange Businesses Maintains Status Quo</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in view of the disappearance of copper auxiliary currency in the Shanghai market, and the inconvenience caused by the temporary use of postal stamps as substitutes in various industries, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to quickly devise remedial measures. The Ministry responded with a telegram instructing the Central Bank to investigate the needs of the Shanghai market, approve and print one-fen and five-fen auxiliary currency notes. According to yesterday's investigation by the Xin Sheng News Agency from banking circles, the Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank's head office has received an order from the Ministry to issue one-fen and five-fen auxiliary currency notes. It is reported that these auxiliary currency notes are currently being printed. At the same time, a large batch of new one-jiao and two-jiao auxiliary currency notes, printed by the Hong Kong China Bookstore, have recently been shipped to Shanghai and are already circulating in the market for adjustment.</p>
<p>The two exchange industries in the city, banknotes and tobacco, are continuing to work hard to maintain the situation regarding the auxiliary currency panic issue, and deeply hope that the authorities of the Ministry of Finance will ship the newly issued auxiliary currency notes to Shanghai as soon as possible to supply the needs of the market. A reporter from the Da Guang News Agency reports the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Both Industries Determined to Continue Maintaining</p>
<p>Shanghai merchants, previously instigated by a certain group, bought and hoarded a large quantity of copper-nickel auxiliary currency circulating in the market by all means, which affected the market, preventing the auxiliary currency from circulating. Various parties have since taken measures to generally switch to using stamps. The exchange issue can still maintain a normal state. The authorities of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce believe that the lack of auxiliary currency has a significant impact on the livelihood of the common people, and have notified the banknote and tobacco exchange associations in writing to carefully handle the matter and switch to using stamps. It is now learned that the member firms of the two industries have implemented a collective purchase of stamps for substitution, and are determined to continue supplying the market's needs with the greatest effort.</p>
<p>Hoping Auxiliary Currency Notes Will Be Shipped to Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson from the two industries who spoke to a reporter from Da Guang News Agency yesterday, it is impossible to statistically determine the amount of auxiliary currency circulating throughout the city in the past. Now, since the lack has had an impact, the four major banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China) and the tram and bus companies, on the one hand, do not release auxiliary currency for use, and on the other hand, the source has been cut off, so there is no special exchange opportunity. According to a notification from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce a few days ago, the National Government has decided on a remedial measure to issue one-fen and five-fen auxiliary currency notes to address the lack of auxiliary currency in Shanghai, which will likely be shipped to Shanghai for circulation at any time in the near future. Therefore, in addition to unanimously complying with the order, all member firms deeply hope that the auxiliary currency notes will be shipped to Shanghai as soon as possible to meet the needs of the market.</p>
<h3>Situation of Datuan After Japanese Invasion</h3>
<p>The defection of the puppet troops in Pudong and the bombing of Datuan and Nanhui by Japanese aircraft have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to those who fled from the two places to Shanghai, when the Japanese army attacked Nanhui on the 5th, four Japanese aircraft flew in early in the morning and dropped 27 small bombs, destroying dozens of civilian houses and killing seven or eight elderly and weak people who did not have time to escape. On the evening of the 6th, when the Japanese army attacked Datuan from Nanhui again, they entered the town on the morning of the 7th and fired more than 100 small steel cannons, aiming at the guerrillas who had withdrawn from the town, but none of them hit. The Japanese army then stationed themselves at the Sheng Yuanfa's new residence and completely destroyed Ni Liangguan's garden with explosives. The Japanese initially intended to burn down the places where the guerrillas had been stationed, but later found it troublesome and had people tear down the houses. The third floor of the Zhuangyuan Tower and the Ma Family Ancestral Hall, among others, have been demolished. Several villagers who fled temporarily were killed, but the remaining houses were unharmed.</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief Work in Gaoyou</h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Cooperation of the North Jiangsu International Relief Committee and the American Advisory Committee felt deeply about the severity of the disaster in northern Jiangsu, and the overall planning of relief methods has been effective. The committee recently felt that the order in Gaoyou was roughly established, and hurriedly sent personnel to investigate and distribute more relief. According to a report from Mr. Lu Tingzhao, the head of the Gaoyou disaster relief investigation, the details of the relief distribution are as follows: (abridged above) In addition to the original distribution of 10,000 yuan, the postal relief added another 2,000 yuan, which saved many disaster victims. Xinpíng, Lingtang, Tianshan, and other villages in the seventh district suffered successive incidents, and two embankments were burned, affecting more than 200 disaster-stricken households, which was extremely tragic. Tingzhao accompanied relief friends to investigate on site. The disaster victims were moved to tears. However, during the incidents at the two embankments, the survey members were scattered in various villages to investigate households, and could not gather at that time. They have now been entrusted to return to the city one after another, and are fortunate to be safe. The relief work in the seventh district was transferred three times before it could be completed on a specific day. The eighth district was surveyed in a few days, and the first district is currently being surveyed. The entire Gaoyou relief project is expected to be completed within a week, summoning refugees and distributing relief funds.</p>

<h3>Smooth Navigation Between Shanghai and Zhejiang; Strict Inspection of Passengers and Goods; Tianbao Wheel Specifically Transfers Passengers and Goods from Shanghai Vessels; Haifu, Kangsha Yi Requesting Permission</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Garrison Headquarters has permitted foreign vessels to dock outside Zhenhai Port, with passengers and goods being transferred by smaller vessels. Vessels such as the Moufu, Fude, Pingha Na have successively set sail, making passenger and cargo transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang increasingly convenient. However, the garrison troops at the fortress conduct extremely strict inspections of imported goods. As for passengers, those who do not have proper guarantees are all detained. In addition, able-bodied men from the interior are still prohibited from leaving the port. Only the elderly, weak, women, and children who have permits from military and police agencies are allowed to take ships to Shanghai. The Tianbao transport, owned by the German company Schier &amp; Rickmers in Ningbo, has been approved by the Ningbo Garrison Command to specifically travel between Ningbo and Zhenhai, with all passengers and goods from Shanghai vessels being transferred by this vessel. The Jing Sheng small transport vessels, etc., continue to operate as usual.</p>
<p>Ha Na Sails to Ningbo, Moufu Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Ha Na vessel of the German Far East Company, having been approved by the Garrison Headquarters of Ningbo, has joined the Shanghai-Ningbo route. It was originally scheduled to set sail for the first time on the morning of the 13th, but was unable to leave the port due to a hurricane hitting the Jiangsu and Zhejiang area, so it set anchor at 4 am yesterday. It is reported that it arrived safely outside Zhenhai Port that evening. The Moufu vessel of Reiss &amp; Co. has completed unloading its cargo and sailed from Zhenhai to Shanghai yesterday morning, arriving at the port around 4 pm, berthing at Jinliyuan Wharf, and is scheduled to continue sailing to Ningbo the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Haifu and Other Vessels Also Request to Join</p>
<p>A reporter from Da Guang News Agency learned from the shipping industry that the German Reiss &amp; Co. also has a Haifu vessel that used to sail the Shanghai-Wenzhou line. As the line is blocked and has been suspended for a long time, it has also requested permission from the Ningbo side to join the Shanghai-Ningbo route. In addition, the Kangsha Yi vessel of the Sino-Italian Company is also requesting permission. Once approved, it can be opened to navigation.</p>
<p>Resuming Shanghai-Dinghai Route, Old Hopes Rekindled</p>
<p>Since the fall of Dinghai, all vessels have been suspended. Subsequently, a Swedish company, Edlund, applied to have the new Anli vessel resume the Dinghai route, and also to stop at Wanzai Mountain. Prior negotiations were held with the Japanese side and the "Maintenance Committee" of Daishan, but it was temporarily blocked by a Japanese warship and returned. It is now learned that some people believe that the disappearance of foreign vessels from Shanghai-Dinghai is profitable, so they have contacted the Japanese side for cooperation and formed the "Daxing Company," deciding to send vessels to resume navigation, including Wanzai Mountain and Shenjiamen. There is also talk of sailing on the 18th, but Shanghai customers are unwilling to load cargo because the area is entirely occupied.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Museum Exhibits Rare Items: Deformed Pig Fetus and Chicks</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Museum has recently received a special donation of a deformed pig fetus from a certain gentleman. The pig has one head, eight legs, two ears, and two tails. At the same time, there are also two deformed chicks, both with four legs, which is very rare. They have now been put on display in cabinet number 125 on the third floor of the museum.

The place where the cards are sold is the Shanghai Museum store, or they can be purchased from the museum staff.</p>
<h3>Charitable Sale of Goods Continues for Two Days; Opening Yesterday; Good Results</h3>
<p>The Chinese Professional Women's Club, in cooperation with the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, is holding a charitable sale of goods to raise summer sanitation funds for refugees. It opened yesterday, and many Chinese and Western people went to visit and purchase items enthusiastically.

<h3>Another New Hurricane About 400 Nautical Miles from Shanghai; Suddenly Stalled After Reaching Taiwan; If Direction Does Not Change, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Will Be Affected</h3>
<p>The hurricane that originated in the Ryukyu Islands in the Pacific Ocean swept over Shanghai on the 12th of this month and then dissipated. However, on the 11th of this month, a new hurricane originated near Luzon Island in the Philippines and suddenly stalled after reaching Taiwan. According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 2 pm yesterday, the hurricane has now reached 24.5 degrees north latitude and 122 degrees east longitude, heading due north or northwest, all in the northern part of Taiwan. The center of the storm reaches an area of ​​60 nautical miles, which is more than twice as strong as the previous hurricane. It is currently about 400 nautical miles from Shanghai. If the direction does not change, the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang will be affected. The sudden strong winds and showers in the city yesterday afternoon were due to climate change and had nothing to do with the new hurricane.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Detains Western Police Inspector for Over an Hour; Japanese Military Police Seize Boat and Beat Coolies; Police Inspector Detained Illegally While Investigating</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin News reports that at around 11:30 am yesterday (the 13th), a wounded Chinese coolie was lying on one of the many wooden boats tied to the No. 5 pontoon on the Bund. Mr. Lees, a Western Police Inspector from the Public Concession Police Department, went to investigate and was intimidated by the Japanese military police and detained for more than an hour. It turns out that some Japanese and Italian soldiers were trying to tow away two Chinese wooden boats. The coolie refused and was severely beaten on the head with a wooden stick by a Japanese military policeman. A few minutes later, Lees saw the situation and went to the boat to investigate the injury. At the same time, the Japanese military police had tied the boat and another wooden boat to a tugboat, preparing to sail away. Lees learned of this and intended to jump onto the pontoon, but a military policeman prevented him from jumping out and threatened to hit him with the wooden stick that had injured the coolie. The boats then sped towards the Water Hotel near the Bund Park, opposite Beijing Road. The hotel was confiscated and is now used by the Japanese military police. Mr. Sampson, Assistant Chief Inspector of the Police Department, witnessed the incident on the Bund and immediately went to the Water Hotel, where he had a long discussion with the officers of the Japanese military police. At 12:40 pm, he accompanied Lees to the Bund. It is reported that the wooden boats have been "confiscated" and not returned to the original Chinese owners, and the fate of the injured Chinese is unknown. At yesterday's reception for journalists by the Japanese side, someone asked about this matter. The naval spokesman said that he knew nothing about it. According to the Japanese side, Lees boarded the ship tied to the No. 5 buoy on the Bund, which exceeded his authority. Therefore, Lees' actions have raised the issue of the respective jurisdictions of the Public Concession Police Department and the Japanese maritime military police. The Japanese side also claimed that at around 11:30 am yesterday, the Japanese maritime military police were inspecting a sailboat, and Lees boarded the boat to "obstruct the Japanese military police from performing their duties." The Japanese maritime military police insisted that the Public Concession Police Department had no right to exercise its powers at the pontoon. It is reported that Lees was taken to the headquarters of the Japanese maritime military police to discuss the matter. It is now confirmed that Lees' actions were due to differing views on police powers between the two sides.</p>
<h3>The Millard's Review Exposes the Evils of Western Shanghai; Gambling and Opium Rampant Under Japanese Protection; Gambling Dens on Gordon Road Thriving</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the Millard's Review, to be published tomorrow (the 15th), will carry an article exposing the evils of opium and gambling in Shanghai's notorious "badlands." The "badlands" include three key areas within the jurisdiction of the "Shanghai Municipal Government." These three areas are directly under the jurisdiction of three groups: the Opium Den, the Earthwork Firm, and the Opium Den Owners Association. The most important and thriving area is Caojiadu, where the supply of narcotics to opium smokers in the Public Concession and the French Concession comes from. The daily turnover is 2 million yuan. Its general sales office is jointly operated by the Earthwork Industry Association and the puppet "Renovation Government's" "Opium Suppression Bureau." The "Opium Suppression Bureau" recently set up its headquarters in the Broadway Mansions. The Earthwork Firm obtains opium from the general sales office of the Japanese Army and enjoys a certain degree of independence without interference because the "Dadao" police are merely auxiliary figures of the "bodyguards" and hooligans hired by the earthwork dealers to protect their drug trade. Earth prices have soared compared to the past, the reason being that the Japanese side levies heavy taxes. In some occupied areas, salaries are paid with opium, such as in Nanjing, Wuxi, and Shanghai. The gambling dens in Caojiadu are all "second-class," but they are very profitable. Wealthier gamblers often go to the gambling dens on Yuyuan Road, Daxilu, Jing'an Temple Road, and outside Haig Road. The most famous is Hollywood Amusement Park. A gambling den called Asia Club at No. 65 Gordon Road is entirely within the Public Concession. Its nightly turnover once exceeded Hollywood Amusement Park. The spread of gambling evils into the Public Concession is inevitable. It is now rumored that there are also several small roulette wheels in various public houses on Jing'an Temple Road and other main roads. It is doubtful why the Public Concession authorities do not take action to suppress them. Are they afraid of the Japanese, or is there another reason? The white pigeon lottery, which has long been banned by the Chinese government, has now been revived under the protection of the Japanese side. Its headquarters is located near the corner of Jessfield Road and Yuyuan Road, behind the Paramount Ballroom. The Japanese authorities prohibit all Japanese from going to the "badlands." The area is exclusively for Chinese to "seek pleasure" (occasionally a few foreigners set foot), and the Japanese are precisely establishing the so-called "new order" for the Chinese.</p>
<h3>Extorting Tang Shuqian, the Perpetrators are Punished</h3>
<p>Tang Shuqian (real estate businessman), a local resident of No. 2, Lane 1124, Xinzha Road, received three anonymous threatening letters in March of this year, demanding 850 yuan. Tang ignored them, and the bandits did not take any action later. Until between June 24 and 28, suddenly letters bearing the name of the Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army were received again,</p>
<p>demanding 60,000 yuan. Two bullets were attached to the letters, threatening Tang to "eat hygiene pills," and the language was fierce. He secretly reported to the Gordon Road Police Station. On the afternoon of the 28th, the bandits were instructed to send representatives to Tang's house to negotiate, saying that giving money could be discussed. At that time, Chinese Detective Wang Chengying and Detective Xu Decheng of the police station were nearby Tang's house,</p>
<p>observing the situation for a while. As expected, Zhuang Meichu from Pudong and Zhang Guoying from Suzhou arrived slowly and were arrested. They were interrogated and it was learned that the accomplices were in the Continental Hotel at No. 402, Lane 431, Pushi Road, French Concession. They rushed to the address and arrested Zhang Zhenqiu, Xu Yunbao, Cai Quansheng, and others, and found a seal of the absconding leader Ma Pengfei and a seal of the Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army. They were all taken to the police station and sent to the First Special District Court. After the interrogation was completed,</p>
<p>they awaited sentencing on record. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Yuanzi presided over the Third Criminal Court and sentenced Zhuang Meichu to ten months imprisonment, and Zhang Zhenqiu, Xu Yunbao, Zhang Guoying, and Cai Quansheng to four months each. One bullet and one seal of Ma Pengfei of the Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army were confiscated. Zhang Guoying and Cai Quansheng were given a three-year suspended sentence each. Police Station lawyer Li Zhishan waived the appeal and released them immediately.</p>
<h3>Extortion by Transporting Corpse in Coffin, Principal Culprit Arrested</h3>
<p>At 3 pm on the 11th, at the Zhuangyuanlou Restaurant at No. 176 Aierkekaolu Road, Song Xigen (local gangster), a regular customer who often went to the restaurant for meals, of No. 910 Zhoujiazui Road, asked for a bowl of fried sliced pork to be sent to his home. Wang Jiusheng, the Ningbo owner of Zhuangyuanlou, refused to send it because Song already owed several yuan for meals, which angered Song. In the evening, he colluded with his apprentice, Wang Jinfeng, a 17-year-old Ningbo native, and obtained a small coffin containing a child's corpse from somewhere. They placed it at the entrance of the restaurant, using it as an excuse to extort 50 yuan in legal tender. The case occurred, and they were arrested and sent to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. At 2 pm on the 13th, Chinese detectives from the Huishan Police Station arrested Wang in Yuezhou Road. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court, requesting detention. Judge Huang ruled to postpone the trial together with the previous one.</p>
<h3>Two Perpetrators Sentenced for Kidnapping and Raping Women</h3>
<p>Mrs. Yuan Zhang from Ningbo, while holding her three-year-old daughter Lin Di, went to the rooftop garden of the Sincere Company on March 1st two years ago. She was seduced by Wang Shilin, a tourist from Suzhou, with sweet words and went to a hotel with him. Later, Wang colluded with accomplices to trick Yuan Zhang to Dalian, intending to force her into prostitution. Fortunately, she was alert and took the opportunity to escape and report to the police station. A telegram was sent to Shanghai, and her husband Yuan Ade went to collect her. Recently, she encountered them on the road and reported them to the police, who arrested and interrogated Wang Shilin and his accomplice Chen Shunhe at the Special Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Yigao ruled that Wang Shilin and Chen Shunhe were jointly guilty of repeated crimes of kidnapping with intent to rape women, and sentenced them each to three years imprisonment to serve as a warning.</p>
<h3>Young Man Seduces Young Girl, Secret Meeting in Room, Zhang Yinzhang Accused of Endangering Family</h3>
<p>Wu Rubin, a 48-year-old Changshu native residing at No. 16, Lane 317, Xixianaisi Road, French Concession, makes a living selling rice cakes. His daughter, Wu Gendi, 18 years old, is somewhat attractive. She used to live in the countryside and came to Shanghai in May of last year to escape the war and lived with her father. She often played with her younger brother at the entrance of the alley. Zhang Yinzhang, a young man of the same age as the girl from Haining, who lives at No. 19 in the same alley and sells coal, also often stayed at the entrance of the alley with his nephew (the son of his sister), so the man and woman met, and from teasing words, they developed a romance. At 3 pm on May 12 of this year, Zhang led the girl to a hotel for illicit sex. At 8 pm that night, they went home separately. On the night of June 22, Yinzhang again enticed Gendi to the 37th room of the Shanghai Hotel on Carter Road to continue their affair. The next day, they returned home. The girl's parents learned about it and believed that Zhang Yinzhang had committed a criminal act by seducing a girl under the age of 20 for illicit sex. They hired lawyer Liu Yan to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District, accusing Zhang Yinzhang of endangering the family. According to the complaint, the court, yesterday morning, Judge Sun Penghui presided over the Second Criminal Court for the trial. Both parties accompanied by lawyers appeared in court to await interrogation. In court, because the case concerned morality, it was announced that the public should be prohibited from attending. After deliberation, it was announced that the trial was concluded, and the sentencing was scheduled for the morning of the 21st. The defendant was ordered to provide bail, and if no bail was provided, they would be taken into custody.</p>
<h3>Second Landlord Evicts Third Tenant</h3>
<p>The shikumen at No. 7 Ruian Lane, at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Meiboge Road, Public Concession, has a second landlord named Mr. Xu, who practices traditional Chinese medicine. Xu lives behind the living room downstairs, while the living room is used as a clinic. The upstairs is rented out to others. The front and rear buildings were rented to Bi Wanshi from Pudong for a monthly rent of 35 yuan, with 20 yuan for the front building and 15 yuan for the rear building. In July of last year, Bi subleased the rear building to a relative named Pan Zhishan, 45 years old, from Nanhui County, Pudong, who is currently an employee in the seasoning department of the Far East Industrial Company at No. 175 Guangdong Road, Jiangxi Road. Three days ago, Bi Wanshi moved back to his hometown in Pudong because the expenses in this city were too high, but Pan still lives in the rear building. Unexpectedly, after Bi moved out, Mr. Xu did not recognize Pan as a third tenant and issued an eviction order, and moved all of Pan's clothes and utensils into the lane the day before yesterday evening, causing a dispute between the two parties. Now, after mediation, Pan Zhishan is required to move out within one month, but the second landlord refuses, so Pan reported to the Xinzha Police Station, who sent detectives to investigate and await handling.</p>
<h3>Chinese Detective Strangles Mistress, Police Station Files Appeal, Further Interrogation Postponed Due to Injury, Detective Refuses to Reveal Name of Deceased Woman</h3>
<p>At around 10 am on the 13th, in room 10 of the Tongli Public Inn at No. 6, Lane 195, Fujian Road, a man strangled a woman to death, and then jumped out of the building to commit suicide, injuring his head. The case was investigated by Chinese Detective Chen Yonggui and Detective He Renrui of the Old Zha Police Station, and it was learned that the murderer was Wu Yuguang, 28 years old, from Shandong, a Chinese detective No. 2478 of the General Police Station. It was further learned that the deceased woman was the detective's mistress. The detective first strangled the woman to death with cotton yarn, and then stabbed her several times with a knife. Then he committed suicide by jumping out of the building. The detectives found a bottle of Lysol, two glass cups, and a handkerchief stained with saliva in the room. As for the name of the deceased woman and the reason why the detective committed the murder, it is still difficult to ascertain because the detective refuses to reveal anything. Yesterday morning, Police Station lawyer Ru Baoyi filed a lawsuit against the detective in the First Special District Court according to Article 271 of the Criminal Law. However, because he was injured and receiving treatment in the hospital, he could not appear in court, so he requested that the trial be postponed. Judge Xiao Xiefei approved the case to be postponed for one week for further interrogation.</p>

<h3>Rice Shop Owner Denies Biological Daughter: Court Orders Blood Test for Identification; Debate to Resume After Testing</h3>
<p>Zhang Huiming, the 45-year-old owner of Dongcheng Rice Shop at No. 120 Ganshi East Road and a native of Baoshan, was recently sued in the Second Special Court's Civil Division by Chen Qinbao, a young Suzhou woman residing at No. 15 Qingfu Road, Pushi Road, in her capacity as the legal representative of her four-year-old daughter, Zhang Gendi. The suit seeks confirmation that Zhang Gendi is Zhang Huiming's biological daughter. After receiving the complaint, the court yesterday, with Judge Li Liang presiding in the Seventh Tribunal, summoned the defendant Zhang Huiming, who appeared with his legal representative for questioning. First, the plaintiff Chen Qinbao, holding her daughter Zhang Gendi, testified that she and the defendant Zhang Huiming had lived together in Shanghai due to their romantic relationship, and that they had a daughter named Gendi (pointing to the girl in her arms), who is now four years old. Initially, the defendant said that his wife at home was too jealous and asked the plaintiff to take their daughter back to Suzhou, promising to cover their living expenses. The plaintiff, understanding the defendant's situation, temporarily separated from him. In the beginning, the defendant kept his promise and sent a small amount of living expenses monthly. However, in recent years, the defendant's heart has changed, and he has neglected the living expenses of the plaintiff and her daughter. Therefore, she has been forced to file a lawsuit. Then, the defendant Zhang Huiming testified that he had long broken off relations with the plaintiff, and that the girl Zhang Gendi she was holding was not his daughter, so he was unwilling to bear the responsibility of raising her. The court questioned both parties at length, but each stuck to their own story. The plaintiff requested a blood test for identification. The court then ordered Chen Qinbao to take her daughter Zhang Gendi, along with Zhang Huiming, to the forensic doctor to undergo a blood test. The case was adjourned, and the debate will resume after the test results are available.</p>
<h3>On Avenue Petain: Man Abducted; Fortunately, Police Arrive in Time to Take Him to the Station; Thugs Parked Car in Advance, Indicating a Plan</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:30 AM, on the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch in the French Concession, a man in his thirties, dressed in a gray long gown and well-groomed, was walking slowly with his head down, alone, from north to south. When he reached Avenue Petain, a black-plated car suddenly sped out of Avenue Edward VII, following him. Seeing the man, it screeched to a halt. Four men, including some in Western suits and some in Chinese attire, jumped out of the car, stopped the man, and began dragging him into the vehicle. The man struggled, and the car window was kicked and broken in the process. At that moment, nearby patrol officers, having received information, arrived and, fearing the car would drive away, drew their guns and ordered them to stop. All were taken to the Avenue Petain police station. It is understood that the single man was on his way to find a friend, surnamed Li, who had just arrived in Shanghai from another port and was staying at a friend's house in the French Concession. Other details are still under investigation by the police.</p>
<p>The English-language North China Daily Mail reported that at 10:15 AM today (the 14th), four plainclothes Japanese men attempted to kidnap a Chinese person near the intersection of Avenue Petain and Avenue Edward VII. The French Concession police are currently investigating. According to the French Concession Intelligence Department, the Japanese men apparently drove up to the Chinese person's location in a car and stopped. However, due to the arrival of a patrol officer, they sped away. The Intelligence Department also denied earlier reports that a Chinese person had been kidnapped and was crying for help from inside the car.</p>
<h3>German-Italian Firm Charters Ship to Resume Shipping to Northern Jiangsu; The "Livorno" to Test Run to Funing Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Funing shipping route was previously served by several foreign vessels, including Yongzhen, Hafa, Haida, Kailin, and Huifeng. However, after the town of Hexing in Funing was bombed by Japanese aircraft in early February of this year, the Yongzhen, Hafa, and Haida happened to be there. While attempting to avoid the bombing, they sailed to the Sheyang River and were seized by Japanese warships and taken to Qingdao. They were later released after negotiations by the consuls of various related countries. The Japanese side then blockaded the mouth of the Sheyang River, prohibiting navigation, causing the Shanghai-Funing line to be suspended for nearly half a year. However, Hexing Town is a transportation hub in northern Jiangsu. The German-Italian firm at No. 53 Fuzhou Road, in order to resume shipping to northern Jiangsu, has recently chartered the Norwegian ship "Livorno" from Hualun Shipping Company to sail to Hexing Town in Funing. All procedures have been properly negotiated with all parties. It is approved to set sail from Shanghai at 3:00 PM today for a test run to Funing.</p>
<h3>Two Customs Brokers Jointly Organize Through Transport Between Shanghai and Kunming; Only Six Days from Shanghai to Saigon; Second Voyage of Taikoo's Shanghai-Siam Route to Commence</h3>
<p>Since the fall of Shantou, freight transport from Haiphong has become even more important, as it is the only port through which inland transport can occur. However, the goods transported in the past have piled up like mountains, making it difficult to disperse them in a short time. Moreover, goods are still being transported there in a steady stream, making transport inland particularly difficult. Seeing this, Mautung at No. 12 Yong'an Fang in the French Concession and Tsin Yuan at No. 34, two customs brokerages, have jointly organized through transport between Shanghai and Kunming, opening a new shipping route. Goods are transported from Shanghai to Saigon, and from Saigon, they are loaded onto trains and transported directly to Kunming for delivery. It is said that it only takes six days from Shanghai to Saigon. The two companies have personnel stationed along the route from Saigon to Kunming to take care of everything. All procedures are simple, reliable, and efficient. As for Taikoo's newly opened Shanghai-Siam route, the first voyage was made by the Suzhou ship on the morning of Tuesday (the 11th) of this week. Now, the Zhangjiakou ship, which previously sailed the Shantou-Siam route, has been transferred to Shanghai to join the Shanghai-Siam route. It is scheduled to depart Shanghai for its second voyage on Saturday (the 22nd) of next week. The ship is currently en route from Hong Kong to Shanghai and is expected to arrive in port on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Dance Hostess Zhang Xiaofeng Loses Love, Takes Poison and Dies</h3>
<p>Zhang Xiaofeng, an 18-year-old Shandong woman residing at No. 5 Min Cun, Minti Yin Road, South Chu Chia Bridge, French Concession, worked as a dance hostess at the Jue Lu Dance Hall on Chu Chia Ching Road. Recently, due to a failed love affair, she became despondent. Yesterday morning at 1:00 AM, after returning home from the dance hall, she committed suicide by swallowing poisonous liquid. Her roommate, Fang Aizhen, discovered her, reported it to the police, and she was taken by ambulance to Guangci Hospital. Treatment was ineffective, and she died not long after being admitted. The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Mortuary for an autopsy. Detectives were sent to investigate the cause of death with her father, Zhang Deshan (55 years old). The case will be reported to the Second Special Court today for the dispatch of personnel to examine the body.</p>
<h3>Young Blind Woman Sues Her Father-in-Law and Husband for Obstructing Freedom; Both Sides Stick to Their Stories, Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>Zhang Xiaomei, a 21-year-old Suzhou native and young blind woman residing at No. 23 Duofu Lane, Caishi Road, Kangti Road, French Concession, filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing her father, Zhang Genda (52 years old, also from Suzhou, a night soil collector, residing at No. 3 Pingjiang Lane, Lan Weiai Road), and her husband, Zhang Huojin (28 years old, with a scabby head), of obstructing her freedom. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Pengxian presided over the trial, and both parties arrived on time. According to the plaintiff, Zhang Xiaomei, she was taken in as a child from an orphanage in Suzhou by the first defendant. After raising her for a year, she lost her sight. The defendant intended to return her to the orphanage, but they refused to accept her. Three years later, he sent her to a fortune-telling house to learn fortune-telling. She now sets up a fortune-telling stall at the intersection of Caishi Road and Kangti Road to make a living. At the age of 18, the first defendant insisted on marrying her to the second defendant, his son Zhang Huojin. After the marriage, she discovered that her husband had bad habits, including gambling and whoring, and did not care about the family's livelihood. Instead, he asked her for money to squander. Recently, Zhang Liansheng, a member of her clan, told her that her husband wanted to break her legs to prevent her from doing business. Fearing future trouble, she filed the lawsuit, requesting an investigation. The defendants, Zhang Genda and Zhang Huojin, father and son, testified together that they treated her very well. They had taken her in and raised her since she was a child, and they had paid for her to learn fortune-telling, spending three or four hundred yuan. Recently, she had listened to the instigation of her lover, Zhang Liansheng, and filed a false accusation. They requested that the court investigate the matter. After reviewing the testimonies, the court declared the trial concluded, as the case was clear, and scheduled the verdict for the 21st. Both parties were dismissed.</p>

The Second Special Court opened the case, and yesterday, Judge Zhu of the Criminal Division summoned the plaintiff Tang Xiaoqing, along with his legal representatives, to appear and state the details of the case. The defendant Jiang Yinwan denied everything and said that it was made clear at the time that both parties would still have to share the living room, as indicated in the rental agreement. He also retained lawyer Ge Zhitan to defend him in court. After reviewing the testimonies, the court adjourned the case and scheduled a further hearing for the 24th of this month. The defendant was released on bail.</p>

<h3>Essential Knowledge for Going to Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Singapore is located at the southern tip of the British Malaya Peninsula. Those who initially decide to go there are commonly called "newcomers." Due to environmental concerns, the local government has repeatedly changed the order restricting Chinese newcomers from entering the country. Therefore, newcomers are also known as "restricted visitors." Currently, 500 people are allowed to enter each month. According to the recent ticket prices stipulated by various shipping companies, the fare from Hong Kong is 75 Hong Kong dollars, and the fare from Xiamen is 180 yuan in national currency. However, since many Chinese people go there to seek a living, the number of tickets is often insufficient to meet the demand. Therefore, the price of these tickets depends on market supply and demand and fluctuates accordingly, reaching a high of 280-290 Hong Kong dollars and still being unavailable. The lowest price is also 110-120 Hong Kong dollars. Therefore, those who wish to go there should book early to avoid unexpected losses. Regarding passports, they are not strictly necessary. Because most overseas Chinese travel in steerage, they only need to pay a landing fee of "5 Singapore dollars" (also known as an entry tax, which is used to register for residence) upon arrival. Oldcomers must hold a residence permit issued by the local British government. When returning to their home country, they must apply for an extension of their return period to Singapore. Failure to return by the deadline will invalidate the permit. If they wish to return again, the same procedures as for newcomers apply. The fare for oldcomers from Hong Kong is 45 Hong Kong dollars. If they entrust a reliable travel agency to make the booking in advance, they can save 10 or 15 dollars. Those who wish to go to Penang have the same procedures as Singapore. Whether they are newcomers or oldcomers, they must add 5 Hong Kong dollars to the Singapore fare. Those traveling from Xiamen must add 20 national currency. For other details, please inquire at the Shanghai branch of the Nanyang Travel Agency, No. 29 Rue du Consulat, French Concession, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Ji Detang Cough and Asthma Balm</h3>
<p>"Ji Detang Cough and Asthma Balm," secretly prepared by the owner of Ji Detang at No. 3 Wang De Li, Gordon Road, corner of Avenue Edward VII, has always been given away free of charge to the poor and sick. Because one person's resources are limited, it was publicly sold last year for two yuan per pack of two plasters. The poor and sick are not charged. Those who are extremely poor are still given it away as usual to fulfill the wish. (Please send letters directly to the hall to request it. If readers can inform the poor and sick, the merit is immeasurable.) Therefore, those who purchase it also gain merit indirectly. This balm specializes in treating coughs and asthma in men, women, the elderly, and children, both new and old. Even asthma that has lasted for decades can be cured. Many patients have sent letters to thank them. For convenience, it has been specially entrusted to Ye Ruixin Zhai Fragrance Shop (telephone 46137) at the north end of Laozha Bridge and Hefac Company at the eastern end of Jingde Road in Suzhou for retail.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
<p>According to the entrustment of Mr. Feng Kaitang, the owner of Feng Changhe sailboat, I have read the news column of today's Shen Bao wooden pier, which contains a news item that all four coal cinder boats were sunk by a hurricane. The content roughly states that the Xiehe Yongji sailboat recently hired the Feng Changhe barge to transport coal to Shaoxing. Unexpectedly, the Feng Changhe crew and the boat owner had a dispute over liquor money, which was suspended for three days. Yesterday, the four barges suddenly encountered a hurricane in Shanghai and were all overturned. The lives of the crew members are unknown, so the barge owner reported it to the water police for record. This does not conform to the facts. The day before yesterday, Chen Aliang hired me to ship goods, stating that they were going to Daishan, Zhejiang. Yesterday evening on the twelfth of this month, a line of coal barges were moored together. After investigation, it was found that they were all going to Shaoxing. I refused because the stated location did not match the place mentioned when the boat was hired. Moreover, all the coal barges were still moored beside our boat during yesterday's hurricane, and they were not damaged at all. There is also no fact that the four barges overturned. Furthermore, the Xiehe Yongji boat was not directly hired. Therefore, I have specially entrusted you to send a letter to the newspaper to correct this statement. Based on this, I am sending you a letter with the facts, hoping that your newspaper will include it in the letter column to clarify the truth. Thank you sincerely. To the News Column of the Shen Bao Newspaper, Lawyer Tao Ran, July 12.</p>

<h3>Forward Exchange Rates Tightening Again</h3>
<p>— By Zhongyong</p>
<p>Regardless of applications for import exchange or the settlement of export exchange, the Shanghai foreign exchange market is not affected. Therefore, recent reports that import exchange is not being supplied and export exchange is allowed to proceed freely are inaccurate. However, it cannot be denied that the buying and selling of forward exchange in the black market, whether directly or indirectly, will still affect the foreign exchange fund. This newspaper has repeatedly stated this. Recently, there has been an increase in forward exchange activity. Even if the foreign exchange holdings are exceptionally strong, a small leak can sink a great ship, and there will inevitably be a day of depletion. However, the British representatives in Parliament have repeatedly stated that they will maintain the Chinese legal currency, without considering the leakage of Chinese foreign exchange, which flows out from the hands of British and American banks. If there is no way to protect Chinese foreign exchange, there is no point in maintaining Chinese legal currency; this is a matter of cause and effect. Now, the absorption of Chinese foreign exchange is being accelerated, and the Chinese side seems to be strengthening its defenses. Yesterday, forward exchange rates tightened again. Whether this is temporary or permanent, or due to the Chinese government not supplying it, cannot be determined until the facts are clear. However, if British and American merchants are determined to consolidate Chinese finance and maintain Chinese legal currency, it is indeed necessary to thoroughly curtail or reform the free trading and unrestricted supply in the Shanghai black market. The forward exchange market should be tightened and eventually stopped, and the scope of spot trading should be gradually reduced, step by step. This will certainly help to recover some of the loss of Chinese foreign exchange. Some may think that this method will hinder foreign merchants' trade, but they do not know that it is precisely for the sake of preserving the long-term interests of foreign merchants' trade with China. Preserving the foreign exchange that China does not need to spend now is the foundation for the future development of foreign trade. Rather than allowing valuable foreign exchange to flow into the hands of one person, it is better to preserve it and allow it to grow for future use by all parties. Therefore, not only should forward exchange be stopped, but also acting as an intermediary for buying and selling foreign exchange should be stopped. Do not act as a wedding dress for others and cause trouble for yourself. British and American merchants should not be so foolish. However, British and American merchants are still hesitant and unwilling to make a decision.</p>
<h3>Finance Slight Weakening of Foreign Bank Supply; Foreign Exchange Forward Rates Hit New Lows; Spot Rates Diverge Further from August Rates; Arbitrage Monthly Interest Reaches Around Six Percent</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The unofficial exchange market for British and American currencies initially saw extremely flat spot rates. Later, due to heavier settlement demands from foreign firms and slightly weaker willingness to sell U.S. dollars among foreign banks, there was a slight softening. However, the British pound was fortunate to have HSBC's ongoing supply, which allowed it to maintain and stabilize at its original price. Futures for July and August saw continued strong buying from Sassoon, coupled with a very weak willingness to sell from foreign banks and strong buying interest, resulting in a tightening market. Later, market rumors of a change in leadership at a certain domestic public institution further agitated sentiment. Consequently, both Chinese and Western speculators, unable to distinguish clearly, competed to buy aggressively. Furthermore, telegrams from Hong Kong also urged aggressive buying, exacerbating the tightening trend, with little sign of retreat. August rates hit an unprecedented high for far-month contracts, initially driving the spread to the edge of six pence, at 6.0625 pence. The U.S. dollar broke into the 12-yuan range, reaching 11.78125, further widening the swap spreads. The difference between July and August for the British pound was 0.28125, and for the U.S. dollar, 0.5625. The combined monthly interest (excluding commissions) reached a strong 4.5%. The spread between spot and August rates was half a penny for the British pound and one yuan for the U.S. dollar, increasing the monthly interest to around six percent. However, banks did not post firm quotes, and Chinese merchants dared not participate, resulting in very little arbitrage activity. As for the Hong Kong dollar, due to strong buying interest from foreign firms, it broke into the 44-yuan range again, ultimately tightening by 0.25.</p>
<p>Sassoon and Hong Kong interests both settling purchases.</p>
<p>Early morning saw London rates at a recent high of 0.0025, with forwards up 0.03125. New York silver prices remained unchanged, and London gold prices also remained unchanged. Exchange rates were unchanged for British pounds against U.S. dollars, Shanghai currency, and French francs. U.S. dollars were also unchanged against British pounds, Shanghai currency, and French francs. Central bank listed rates for various currencies remained as before (application stopped). Banks' morning opening spot selling prices were 6.0625 pence for the British pound and 12.78125 yuan for the U.S. dollar, showing no change from the previous close. After opening, foreign firms successively bought British pounds at spot rates of 6.0625 pence and U.S. dollars at spot rates of 12.78125 yuan from HSBC and other foreign banks and a certain American bank, stabilizing the market. When HSBC's listed rates were announced, they remained unchanged. When the silver equalization tax was announced, it remained exempt from a small fee. Foreign firms showed strong interest in buying futures but were unwilling to sell unless at high prices, leading to a softening trend. It was estimated that a certain bank absorbed U.S. dollars for this month at 12.625 yuan from foreign merchants. Subsequently, Sassoon aggressively bought U.S. dollars for this month from American banks at only 12.5625 yuan, and U.S. dollars for August at only 12.15625 and 12.125 yuan. Simultaneously, the British pound for this month tightened to 6.04375 pence, and for August softened to 6.012875 pence. However, British banks like HSBC showed no willingness to supply at these prices. By noon, foreign firms absorbed Hong Kong dollars at 44.125 yuan from Anda, a foreign bank, with little change. At the noon close, banks' spot selling prices remained unchanged from the morning opening for both British and American currencies.</p>
<p>U.S. Dollar August Rates Enter 12 Yuan Range</p>
<p>Later in the day, due to heavier settlement demands from foreign firms, HSBC continued to support the British pound, resulting in a market situation where the British pound was flat and the U.S. dollar slightly soft. It was estimated that foreign firms settled purchases of British pounds from HSBC at a spot rate of 6.0625 pence and also bought U.S. dollars at a spot rate of 12.75 yuan from American banks. At that time, the market was agitated due to rampant rumors in China, causing a surge in sentiment. Both Chinese and Western speculators leaned towards buying futures, coupled with sudden aggressive buying via telegram from Hong Kong and difficulty for foreign banks to sell, tightening the situation. It was estimated that telegrams from Hong Kong and Sassoon, along with Chinese speculators, successively bought British pounds for this month from foreign banks, driving the rate from 6.040625 pence to 6.034375 pence, and U.S. dollars for this month from 12.4375 yuan to 12.375 yuan. Subsequently, they also settled purchases of British pounds for August from British banks at 6.0125 pence, and U.S. dollars for August broke into the 12-yuan range, with the lowest price quoted at 11.78125 yuan, an unprecedented tightening. Later, the Hong Kong dollar also tightened significantly due to aggressive buying from foreign firms and money exchanges, breaking into the 44-yuan range. It was reported that foreign banks' selling price softened to 43.875 yuan. At the evening close, banks' spot selling prices were 6.0625 pence for the British pound and 12.75 yuan for the U.S. dollar, 6.034375 pence for the British pound for this month and 12.375 yuan for the U.S. dollar, and 6.00625 pence for the British pound for August and 11.8125 yuan for the U.S. dollar. Ultimately, compared to the previous day, spot rates were flat for the British pound and softened by 0.03125 yuan for the U.S. dollar. This month's rates tightened by 0.0125 for the British pound and softened by 0.025 yuan for the U.S. dollar, while August rates shrank by 0.01875 for the British pound and rose by 0.0375 yuan for the U.S. dollar. The Hong Kong dollar also tightened by 0.0025 based on the final price. The day's trading record is listed below.</p>
<h3>Baseless Rumors Drive Cash Prices Higher; Breaking Through the 2,630 Yuan Barrier; Trading Activity Increases to Around 900 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday's situation for raw cash silver in the unofficial market: Initially, the market was extremely flat. Although a certain bank (acting on behalf of a foreign bank) and Hong Kong interests successively absorbed supply, and silver shops also showed buying interest, the strong willingness to supply from cash shops kept prices from rising, hovering around 2,600 yuan. Later, unexpectedly, rumors of a change in personnel in a certain department surfaced, and at the same time, foreign exchange futures tightened sharply, igniting buying sentiment. General speculators competed to buy aggressively, and the willingness to sell from sellers suddenly diminished, leading to a rapid surge. Prices broke through three major barriers, from 2,610 yuan to 2,630 yuan, reaching a peak of 2,631 yuan at one point. However, the final result was a sharp increase of 30 yuan. Trading activity was brisk throughout the day, reaching around 900 taels. Silver jewelry prices rose by 3 yuan, while customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Raw Silver Rises Sharply by 30 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened strong due to a certain foreign firm entrusting a certain bank to absorb supply and money exchanges acting on behalf of retail investors also starting to buy. The market was firm, opening 2 yuan higher. When money exchanges bought 50 taels from cash shops at 2,602 yuan, buying sentiment was strong, but the strong willingness to sell from cash shops caused a slight dip. The rate briefly rebounded by one yuan. A certain cash shop forcefully sold 100 taels to a certain bank at 2,601 yuan. Subsequently, the rate dipped again by one yuan. Gold shops sold 50 taels to a certain silver shop (acting on behalf of Hong Kong interests) and Xian Yuhao sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange, all at 2,600 yuan. Following that, gold shops again bought 50 taels from securities interests at 2,601 yuan. Later, at the same price, a certain silver shop again absorbed a total of 50 taels from cash shops on behalf of Hong Kong interests. At that time, a certain bank also absorbed 50 taels from money exchanges on behalf of a foreign firm, all at 2,600 yuan. Later, silver shops successively absorbed a total of 60 taels from cash shops and money exchanges 30 taels, all at the same price. At noon, the price was pressed down by 2 yuan, with cash shops selling 50 taels to silver shops at 2,598 yuan, serving as the noon closing price. The afternoon opening was still flat. Initially, money exchanges sold 50 taels to gold shops at 2,598 yuan. Following that, gold shops again bought 50 taels from money exchanges at 2,600 yuan. At that time, a certain bank and money exchanges aggressively bought, and the upward momentum gradually intensified. Gold shops sold 50 taels to money exchanges at 2,604 yuan. Suddenly, at 2:25 pm, unfavorable rumors surfaced, and it was further heard that foreign exchange was flat for the British pound but tight for the U.S. dollar, with futures uniformly shrinking significantly. Sentiment surged, and there was a shortage of sellers. Good Samaritans in the market suddenly engaged in reckless buying and dragging, causing a rapid surge. Under the enveloping buying sentiment, the price surged by 21 yuan before silver shops sold 50 taels to gold shops at 2,615 yuan. Soon after, the price jumped up by 3 yuan, with money exchanges buying 30 taels from gold shops at 2,628 yuan. Later, the price was raised again by 4 yuan, breaking through the 30-yuan barrier, with money exchanges mutually trading 30 taels at 2,632 yuan, marking the day's peak. The price then retreated slightly by 2 yuan, with money exchanges mutually trading 50 taels. 2,630 yuan was the evening closing price. As a result, compared to the previous day, the price rose sharply by 30 yuan. It was found that the price had risen for five consecutive days, totaling 53 yuan. The full-day fluctuation was 34 yuan. Cash shops' listed selling price for silver was 2,640 yuan, and the buying price was 2,620 yuan. Currently, the listed price for silver is approximately 50 yuan lower than the listed price for gold. It was inquired that transactions were rare.</p>
<p>Silver Jewelry's Listed Price Reduced</p>
<p>The initial selling price for silver jewelry per tael remained unchanged. However, at 9:40 am, the listed price was raised by one yuan (while Datonghang's listed price for silver was reduced by 0.3 yuan, changed to 2.5 yuan). At 2:45 pm in the afternoon, due to the sharp rise in raw silver prices, the listed price was raised again by 2 yuan. It was estimated that Datonghang's price was changed to 266 yuan, and Xintonghang's price was 264 yuan, with a buying price of 258 yuan.</p>
<p>Sino-British Pure Gold Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>A telegram from London on the 13th stated that the price of pure British gold per ounce remained unchanged at £7 8s 6d, resulting in all market prices at the Central Bank also remaining unchanged. The buying price for Chinese pure gold remained at 1,212.3 yuan, the listed price for customs gold was 2.396 yuan, and the Shanghai standard listed price for gold also remained at 1,207.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Discount Rates Continue to Rise; Call Loan Rates Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange draft bills continued to rise slightly. The discount rate per thousand yuan in the morning was 93.4 yuan, rising to 94.25 yuan in the afternoon, an additional increase of 0.75 yuan compared to the previous day. The call loan rate from the Money Trade Association remained unchanged, listed at 0.18 yuan for both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Remain High; Mostly Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday's prices for pure British gold and British-American exchange rates remained unchanged. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms were settling purchases heavily, and foreign merchants were absorbing supply actively. Foreign banks' supply was relatively smooth, with the market price showing British pounds flat and U.S. dollars tight. Supply of British and American gold pounds was not smooth, and the high raw silver prices kept the market price firm. Demand for British and American gold notes was strong, and forward exchange rates were extremely tight, with market prices rising even more sharply. Demand for Hong Kong notes, French franc notes, and Singapore notes was all strong, and all were rare and valuable. The market situation was firm and rising, with most currencies rising. The supply of Japanese gold notes was relatively smooth, with the evening market at 0.995 yuan. Demand for Korean notes was weak, and the market situation was sluggish, with the evening market at 0.865 yuan. Trading at the association was rare. Zhenxing offered and Longchang bought U.S. dollar notes for 500 yuan. Xintai offered and Longchang bought U.S. dollar notes for 1,000 yuan. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold pounds each rise by 0.5 yuan, British gold notes rise by 0.15 yuan, U.S. dollar notes rise by 0.08 yuan, Hong Kong notes rise by 0.0008 yuan, French franc notes rise by 0.0001 yuan, Singapore notes and Canadian notes each rise by 0.03 yuan, Dutch notes and Philippine notes each rise by 0.01 yuan, rupee notes rise by 0.02 yuan, and Australian gold notes rise by 0.1 yuan. Prices for Annam notes, Italian notes, German gold notes, and Siamese notes remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Securities; Foreign Debt Continues to Fall; Domestic Debt Slightly Rebounds</h3>
<p>In the unofficial securities market, the market situation continued to rise by several angles yesterday, but the situation was already firming. It was reported that the Ministry of Finance announced that the interest would be paid in Chongqing, and that the payment would be made in six months in Shanghai and other ports, either in cash or by remittance. The official order from the Ministry of Finance has not yet arrived in Shanghai. This kind of incorrect news was published earlier in this newspaper based on the principle of reporting everything we hear. It was heard that many parties wanted to find a way out, so they used propaganda to stir up the market. Unexpectedly, the market sentiment became suspicious because of this. Many parties believed that the price had already risen by two yuan in the past two days, but that Class A at 60 yuan and Class C at 50 yuan could not break through. Therefore, they gradually wanted to get out, so they came up with this method. In short, the decision to issue interest is a mystery because the statement is ambiguous, so they want people to fish in troubled waters. For example, at the beginning, Xieda, Zhenkang, and Fukang bought Class C, which once reached 9.1 yuan, and Class A once reached the edge of 60 yuan. However, Dafeng, Lianhe, and other numbers sold heavily on the 5th and 10th, and the market price fell by half a yuan. Later, there was still demand from retail investors, but Songmao, Tongkang, Tiansheng, Hengfu, and other numbers also spit out, and the trend became the end of a strong crossbow. Therefore, the result was only a continued increase of 0.45 to 0.75 yuan, with a total turnover of approximately 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock market situation: Nanyang Yincao stock traded 50 shares at a price of 8.2 yuan. There were some inquiries about the stock market of the public industry association. Jardine stock traded a total of 4,600 shares, with a closing bid price of 18.2 yuan and an ask price of 18.3 yuan. Reclamation stock traded a total of 3,000 shares, with a closing bid price of 5.95 yuan. Telephone stock continued to be strong, with a closing bid price of 12.3 yuan and an ask price of 12.5 yuan. A total of 15,000 shares of various rubber stocks were traded, with prices all at market. In the corporate bond market, 32,000 yuan of the Electricity 5.5% public bond was traded, with prices between 81.5 yuan and 82 yuan. 12,000 yuan of the Public Works Bureau 6% public bond was traded, with a price of 94 yuan. Small amounts of the Telephone 6% public bond and the Citibank 7% public bond were also traded.</p>
<p>London British Merchant Far East Companies' stock market prices for this month on the 13th (Thursday): Except for the Mercantile Bank stock rising by 2 shillings and 6 pence, with a price of £7 5 shillings, the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Debt market prices for this month on the 13th (Thursday): The British-German continued loan British-issued bonds fell sharply by £4, with a price of £42. The good-looking loan British-issued bonds also fell by half a pound, with a price of £32. The rest remained unchanged. Actual goods were offered for sale in London, including 3,000 pounds of good-looking loan British-issued bonds, with a selling price of 31.5 pounds, half a pound lower than the market price. Another 3,000 pounds of French-issued bonds with stamps were offered for sale, with a selling price of 29.5 pounds, 2.5 pounds lower than the British-issued listed price.</p>
<h3>Grain; Rice Prices Continue to Fall; No Longer a Small Amount; But Price Limits Remain</h3>
<p>Du Geng; The domestic rice market has been in a slump this week. After falling straight down, the high-quality goods have plummeted by more than two yuan, and the old grains have fallen even more miserably, reaching about three yuan. This rice situation is only a tragedy for hoarders. Generally, hoarders mainly aim at profit, and they are not concerned about the people's food problem. Now that the rice price has been strictly limited, there is no profit to be made, so they all stand idly by. At the same time, they are all eager to sell the grains that they hoarded before to avoid losses. Once the morale is lost, they will all follow the trend, and the goods that have been damaged by water or moisture will be sold to each other. Therefore, the chips in the market have suddenly increased by three times compared to the past, while the sales market is wooden, resulting in the market falling day by day, and the more it falls, the more fierce it becomes, thus creating this one-thousand-mile-fall situation. Yesterday, the sales market was dull, and the sellers poured out their inventory in order to get rid of it, so the market situation was even more頹. As a result, the selling price of thick and thin japonica rice fell by another 0.3 to 0.4 yuan, and there were no transactions. It was found that the incoming goods from the river included two ships of car wheel buns of more than 2,000 bags to the Songjiang gang. The total turnover of the city was only more than 4,000 stones.</p>
<p>Ke Xian; Yesterday, the sales of local guest rice were dull, and the inventory was full, and the sources were continuous. Under the forced sale of travel stock traders and traffickers, the market immediately saw a tragic fall. High-quality goods can still hold at 16 yuan, 0.3 to 0.4 yuan lower than the previous market, while the goods below the middle grade and the old goods are not inquired, and the decline is huge from 0.5 to 0.6 yuan to 0.7 to 0.8 yuan. However, after the price fell, the sales in this street were slightly active, and the inland rural villages also made up slightly. More than 2,000 bags were opened throughout the day. The Municipal Bureau's price limit has been set to reduce by one yuan next Monday, and the highest price for Xianjian is 16 yuan.</p>
<p>Yang Rice; In the days of adhering to the trend, and with the Xian rice already seeing a tragic fall again, yesterday, Saigon sold more than 100 bags of guest rice in the current market, with a price of only 21.5 yuan, a huge difference of 1.5 yuan compared to the previous opening price of 23 yuan. It is said that the current guest rice is already full of, and the pre-set Yang rice has also been opened, and it is now difficult for Yang rice to stand again.</p>
<h3>Grain; Flour Returned Goods; Selling Price Still Secretly Loose; Local Wheat Weary and Unable to Revive</h3>
<p>The current flour factory disk is standing as before. It is found that, except for the sporadic embellishments, there is still no whole batch of way out for customer road transactions. Because the current silver money is quite tight, and the exchange discount is high, some customers are paying attention to the returned goods of exchange selling price. It is heard that the returned goods in the market are still secretly loose, and the price is within 5 yuan, but it is not a formal market, because the factory is now reducing production after stopping the machine and reducing the car, and it is unwilling to compromise too much in this rare production and sales situation.</p>
<p>The wheat market trend is gradually loosening. Recently, new arrivals of various goods are endless, and the way out only relies on the Japanese factory to make slight purchases. It is heard that the Japanese merchants who previously loaded and exported have also stopped doing so, and the Chinese factories ignore the local wheat because the foreign wheat raw materials are still sufficient, so the market is in this environment, and it is tired and unable to revive for a while. Yesterday, there was not much supply in the market, and most of the people holding the goods went to the warehouse to wait for the opportunity and were unwilling to show samples. Only Shanri Factory added more than 300 bags of Nanjing wheat, and the price was loosened from 6.5 yuan to 6.3 yuan, and it has fallen by 0.15 yuan in two days.</p>

<h3>Yarn/Cotton; Hong Kong-Yunnan Buyers' Appetite Not Fading; Yarn Prices Have Risen for Three Consecutive Days; Increasing Numbers of Weavers Reducing Production; Some Profiteers Disgorging Profits</h3>
<p>Although the yarn market’s rise is slow, it has nonetheless risen for three consecutive days. In truth, the Hong Kong and Yunnan buyers’ procurement of coarse and fine yarn continues unabated. The Hong Kong buyers bought another 660 bales, and the Yunnan buyers bought 230 bales, for a total of 890 bales. Other regions have been affected by transportation blockages and are unable to transport goods, thus bringing their activities to a halt. As for peers, due to restrictions on loans and overdrafts by the banking and money industry, their activity has been greatly impacted. As such, most recent transactions are actual business, marking a source of stability for the market’s foundation. However, opinions are divided on the extent to which future market price changes will remain within a range of 20 yuan. The recent cotton cloth trade is highly lethargic, with the prices of white plain fabric unstable. Smaller weaving factories are reducing production or shutting down, which is clearly closely related to the yarn market.</p>
<p>The yarn market situation: The market’s discussions upon opening this morning were uniformly optimistic, as demand from Guangxi and Yunnan continued to materialize. The market sentiment elevated, and initial offers rose by two or three yuan. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse was 486.5 yuan, and the godown receipt price was 481 yuan. Because the market momentum was tight and customer sales were also strong, market prices steadily rose. Double Horse for outside godowns reached 491 yuan, and godown receipts once reached 484 yuan. Approaching the close, profiteers disgorged profits, resulting in a slight drop of two or three yuan. The price for Double Horse for outside godowns fell to 488 yuan. The half-day turnover was 1,480 bales. The asking prices for 20-count Double Horse rose by 4 yuan, Shepherd flat, Te Jin Cheng rose by 4 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn rose by 4 yuan. The British Jardine factory offered 2,000 bales of 20-count Sheep, priced at 391 yuan, 500 bales of Wufu, priced at 385 yuan, for clearing in one month. The Yong An factory offered 50 bales of 20-count Te Jin Cheng, priced at 505 yuan. Today’s exports of cotton yarn included 1,000 pieces shipped to Tianjin, 2,750 pieces shipped to Hong Kong, 310 pieces shipped to Beihai, and 585 pieces shipped to Haiphong. The amounts bought by each region are listed below.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market continued to rise, but actual demand remained ordinary. Weaving factories are reducing production due to the impact of poor sales, and demand for cotton yarn is reportedly clearing. The listed price for 20-count Yueqin is reportedly around 389 to 390 yuan.</p>
<h3>Unable to Redeem Mortgaged Cotton; Can Only Use Yarn as Collateral</h3>
<p>The New York cotton market was quiet again yesterday. Industries were adopting a wait-and-see attitude to await developments on the Agriculture Ministry’s discussions with major cotton merchants regarding subsidies. The completion of the July term triggered a decline in market prices. Yesterday, Indian figures including forecasts remained unchanged, and Egyptian figures fell by 10 pound coins.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai cotton trade, tight foreign exchange rates once again caused difficulties for the trade. Banks continued to refuse to provide loans for raw cotton. Some factories that had mortgaged cotton in bank warehouses were unable to redeem their goods and could only ship their yarn to trade for raw cotton. This shows the factories’ difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>The local cotton trade has come to a complete halt. As for peer-to-peer transactions, some Indian cotton was traded, but the volume was small, and all were settled using remittance prices, indicating a lack of ready cash. The cotton trade is extremely difficult to conduct. Shipments from Northern Jiangsu have not yet resumed, and thus have still not arrived in Shanghai. Current cotton prices are listed below. Durella; 98.50; peers buy in 300 pieces; remittance, godown trade. Pingguo Er; 81.50; Gao’s company buys in; 200 pieces; remittance, godown trade.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods; Successful Trial Run of Southwest Transport Line; Hope for Activity in Cloth Sales; New Wenzhou Shipping Line Also Under Trial Run</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday’s sales remained poor, and the asking prices continued to drop. However, recent developments in Southwest transport were good. In the past, goods loaded in Sichuan and Yunnan were concentrated in Haiphong, but it has been difficult to ship out of Haiphong, with goods being stored for too long, bearing huge risks and costs, and struggling with a difficult turnover. Recently, British shipping companies expanded their South China shipping route plan, transshipping from Saigon to Kunming. After the trial run, there were no delays along the route. As such, goods from Sichuan and Yunnan have a new shortcut, and there is hope for activity in trading. After the discontinuation of the Wenzhou shipping line, goods are now being imported through Shacheng, south of Wenzhou, and transported through Ruian to Wenzhou, allowing goods transport. A trial run was conducted yesterday, trading 30 to 40 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, serge, and other goods. The aforementioned shipping will develop if unobstructed. Southwest buyers have gradually increased the amount of goods, including Yue and Hong Kong buyers buying in 50 pieces of Ai Zi Fu Gui and other fine twill, fine cloth, Earth coarse cloth, and other goods, as well as 1,000 bolts of color cloth and color twill. Sichuan and Yunnan buyers bought in 3000 bolts of color cloth, color twill, serge, line woolen cloth, printed cloth, satin, plush, and other goods. Overseas buyers from Singapore and other locations bought in over 1,000 bolts of color cloth and color twill. Sales in the current market and the Soviet-controlled areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui are declining due to the cheap prices of East piece goods.</p>
<p>East Piece Goods</p>
<p>Because sales of fine cloth and fine twill were lethargic, they were repeatedly discounted. Yesterday’s market price for Longtou fine cloth was 13.25 yuan, and the East Cotton Foreign Firm’s ask price was very low, with the current ask price only 13.2 yuan and the price for this month’s futures 13.3 yuan. Although only dozens of bales were traded, industry members were more and more apprehensive, and the willingness to buy in the current market grew weaker, with the market remaining soft.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>On the 15th, 260 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai, 92 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 10 pieces were shipped to Guangzhou Bay, and 180 pieces were shipped to Haiphong.</p>
<h3>Autumn and Winter Woolen Fabrics Already Rising</h3>
<p>Autumn and winter woolen fabrics such as plain thick woolen cloth, melton, wide and tight camel hair, thick and thin serge, shammy Han Limeng, yuan zhi tribute wool, colored zi tribute wool, twill cashmere breeches fabric, British and Polish-made overcoat fabric, horse palm-sleeved black light lining, Western-style Chinese clothing flannel, Chongshi Pao Tieke Si, single-sided high-striped flannel, and other fabrics that are used for autumn and winter clothing are rising dramatically. Shoe flannel, as well as 4026 single-sided open water rice, is also being offered at expensive prices. Yesterday, 707 and 1080 Polish plain thick woolen cloth were offered at 4.75 yuan per case (the closing price in February was 4.1 yuan). Single-sided high-striped flannel of British manufacture was offered at 13.5 yuan (previously only sold for 12 yuan), and Japanese goods with artificial cotton were offered at 6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk/Tea; Muki Paralyzed in Europe; Cheaply Dumped Chinese Silk</h3>
<p>Overseas silk markets are firm in both Japan and the U.S., with Lyon also following the rise. Yokohama spot goods were not traded yesterday, with the price for July at 1,190 yuan, up by 7 yuan, and the far term at 1,143 yuan, up by 8 yuan. New York spot goods were sold at the original price, with the near term up by 1 point and the far term up by 1.5 points. Japanese silk in Lyon rose by 2 shirangs. Shanghai silk (grade A) rose by 2 francs; the rest was sold at the prior price. Silk sales overseas, such as in the two most important markets of New York and Lyon, have been dulled by the dumping of cheap, large amounts of “controlled” silk from the occupied areas of China by the Japanese. Reportedly, the Chinese silk dumped by the Japanese in Lyon is a huge 40 francs lower per kilo compared to that sold in Shanghai. As such, Shanghai’s sales in France have been unable to develop.</p>
<p>The local silk market has seen little new development in recent days. Silk prices have shown little fluctuation, and trading is limited to Tin silk and Eri silk. Yesterday, Da Chang and others bought nearly 20 loads from the Bai factory; the price was the same as in the previous market. Eri silk prices were slightly tired, with frying and selling at 1,200 yuan. Yesterday, an electric telegram was requested to discuss the price.</p>
<h3>Hardware; Large Tinplate Scarce in Current Market</h3>
<p>Large tinplate is currently the rarest of all hardware goods circulating in the market, resulting in high standards. This is because of the thin current volume, as well as a lack of shipments of spot goods from overseas. In addition, merchants from Tianjin, Qingdao, Wenzhou, Yantai, Fuzhou, and inland have been aggressively collecting, and factories and peers in this market (such as yarn bobbin factories, lock factories, and toy factories) are also actively buying. Reportedly, only one hardware company on North Suzhou Road has some inventory of this good. Those holding goods are thinking of asking high prices, with 20-gauge currently offered at 200 yuan and 26-gauge at 180 yuan.</p>
<h3>Materia Medica: Gold and Silver Flower Gradually Increases</h3>
<p>Gold and silver flower is produced in Shanxi, also known as Ji Gold and Silver Flower. Since the new goods entered the market, although the source is not continuous, various businesses have frequent needs, and there is a feeling of demand exceeding supply, so the selling price has been increasing day by day. It was found that after the previous market opened at 73.5 yuan, it immediately rose to 80 yuan. At present, the market has already called for 85 yuan, and is in negotiations with customers.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Jinshan Shrimp Tails Both Arriving and Selling are Scarce</h3>
<p>Jinshan shrimp tails have had very few buyers recently, and the source is also scarce. The inventory here is already affected by mold, and all are stored in refrigerated warehouses. It was found that eastern goods such as Chaozhou flat tails are only selling for 115 or 116 yuan. Western goods are still bland and unremarkable, currently the market price is only 185 yuan for large ones and 180 yuan for small ones.</p>

<p>Traffic and Transportation Weekly</p>
<h3>Taikoo Adds a Route to Siam</h3>
<p>— Su</p>
<p>There was no direct route from Shanghai to Siam. Anyone wishing to go to Siam had to take a boat from Shanghai to Hong Kong and then transfer to a Taikoo company ship. Recently, the company has seen a daily increase in passenger and freight traffic to Siam, so it has decided to add a Shanghai-Siam route. The company's Suzhou ship sailed on the 11th of this month, stopping at Hong Kong, Tourane in Annam, Saigon, and reaching Bangkok in Siam. The entire journey takes 16 days. Afterwards, the company will send a ship to Siam every week. The ticket price for the large cabin from Shanghai to Tourane and Saigon is HK$135, the official cabin is 140 yuan in national currency, the room cabin is 108 yuan, the bunk is 79 yuan, and the steerage is 56 yuan. The ticket price for the large cabin to Bangkok is HK$150, the official cabin is 182 yuan in national currency, the room cabin is 141 yuan, the bunk is 104 yuan, and the steerage is 73 yuan.</p>
<p>Saigon is the Nanjing of Annam, and even more so the important port for foreign trade in Annam. The Vietnam National Railway starts here, 1,750 kilometers away from Hanoi, Beijing. Tourane is located between Saigon and Hanoi, also on the railway line. Passengers and goods who wish to transfer from the above two ports to the interior of our country can take the railway directly from the above two ports to Dong Dang on the border of Vietnam, and then they will be in Guangxi Province of our country, which is also quite convenient. All Chinese people entering or passing through must have a passport, which can only be processed after being signed by the French consulate.</p>
<p>Bangkok is the capital of Siam, the center of the railway, and has convenient water and land transportation. The business community is prosperous. There are 300,000 Chinese expatriates living in the city, controlling the city's commerce. Therefore, many Chinese people travel to and from this port. Anyone going to Siam must have a passport issued by a Chinese government agency, which can only be processed after being approved by the Siamese consulate (it is found that there is no Siamese consulate in Shanghai, but there is one in Hong Kong). At the same time, a landing deposit of 250 baht (equivalent to more than 870 yuan in national currency) must be paid upon arrival in Siam. If you have a certificate from the Siamese authorities allowing re-entry, you can be exempt from paying. The deposit will be refunded after a considerable period of time. In addition to submitting a smallpox and epidemic prevention certificate issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department upon landing, you must also undergo an eye examination by a medical officer sent by the authorities. Anyone with trachoma will not be allowed to land.</p>
<h3>The Vietnamese Government Will Change the Entry Method for Foreigners</h3>
<p>— Xun</p>
<p>All Chinese people entering Vietnam must have a passport to leave the country, which will only be allowed to enter after being signed by the French consulate. According to the regulations of the French consulate, a signing fee of 75 francs should be paid for requesting an entry signature, and a residence tax should be paid after arriving in Vietnam. (16 Vietnamese yuan per year, 12 yuan for half a year, 8 yuan for three months).</p>
<p>According to previous reports, from July 1 of this year, the French-Vietnamese government will restrict the entry of foreigners, and each person should pay 100 Vietnamese yuan upon entry, and increase the residence permit fee. According to an inquiry from our consulate general in Hanoi, Vietnam, the French-Vietnamese government does have this intention, but the amount of the increase will not be as much as rumored. The consulate is currently negotiating with the French-Vietnamese authorities, and it has not yet been decided when it will be implemented and how much it will be increased. As for those who pass through Vietnam to go to the interior of our country, this is not the case. They only need to submit a financial guarantee when requesting the French consulate to affix a transit signature. If the consulate considers the guarantee to be unqualified, the applicant must pay a deposit of 100 Vietnamese yuan, which can be refunded when leaving Vietnam in the future.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Studying in the United States (II)</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Preparation Problems</p>
<p>1. Clothing: Clothing is quite important for anyone going to the United States to study or travel. Being abroad, one person represents not only the individual, but is often seen as a representative of a country and a nation. People who do not know each other often use appearance as the standard. Therefore, for clothing, although it is not necessary to be very particular, the word "cleanliness" cannot be ignored. American students are sometimes very casual about their clothes, depending on the habits of different places and schools. Of course, Chinese students can follow the customs, but they must always be above the waterline to avoid being ridiculed by people from other countries. Now, the preparation of clothing before going to the United States is briefly described for men and women:</p>
<p>Men: Male classmates going to the United States, although they all wear suits, it is okay to bring a set of Chinese clothes made of domestic silk. You can wear them at banquets and use them as formal wear. It is best to make ordinary suits at home and bring them with you. It is best to make two pairs of trousers for each suit for convenience. As for the color, thickness, number of sets, etc.: it depends on how long each person stays in the United States, the climate of the region, and each person's choice. There cannot be a fixed standard. The material should be strong, durable, and not easy to change. The suits made of domestic woolen fabrics in our country are similar in quality to those in Europe and the United States, and they can be worn with pride. The climate in the northern United States is cold, so warmer clothes must be prepared. Summer clothes are necessary in the United States, whether it is north or south. Shirts can be made and brought from home. The style should be with a collar and single cuffs to avoid the trouble of washing the neck and changing the cufflinks. White is the most suitable color. It is best to bring fewer silk shirts, because the washing fee is too high and it is easy to damage. In addition, ties, shoes, hats, socks, raincoats, pajamas, underwear, etc., can be brought as needed.</p>
<p>Women: It is best for female classmates going abroad to adopt a "self-sufficient policy." Most of the Chinese female classmates in the United States wear domestic clothes, one is because of habit, and the other is that Chinese clothes are not particularly different from Western clothes. At the same time, the styles of Western clothes often change, and there are also different requirements for dresses for various banquets, which students who are just going to the United States cannot be familiar with. The only way to avoid this is to wear Chinese clothes. Anyway, Americans cannot find fault with this. The clothes are mainly lined single clothes, and at most a few pieces of thin velvet are made, because the temperature indoors in the United States is always very high, no matter where it is. The material is mainly absolute "domestic goods," which not only promotes domestic goods, but also implies the meaning of promoting national quintessence. The clothes worn to banquets should be more exquisite, such as some embroidery, which is even better. You should prepare a few pieces of them. Silk is the best for ordinary clothes, because silk is considered a luxury item in the United States, but it is not considered expensive in our country. It is much cheaper to make Western clothes at home and bring them with you, and the craftsmanship of domestic Western tailors is not bad. It is best to use domestic woolen fabrics for the material. As for coats, they are indispensable in the United States. Leather coats are regarded as very luxurious items in the United States, but they are not considered anything in our country. It is best to use reverse leather for the clothes. It is very useful to prepare one or two pieces to bring with you. Spring and autumn coats can be purchased in the United States, and the price will not be very expensive. It is best to buy silk stockings in the United States, because the weaving method and the fineness of the silk are not comparable to domestic goods. A good pair of silk stockings can be bought for about one US dollar, and ordinary ones are not bad for a few cents.</p>
<p>2. Other Supplies: Hotels and houses in the United States are fully equipped with bedding, so you don't need to bring them. Blankets are also unnecessary. Towels and bath towels are usually available, and they are not expensive to buy. Other things such as the national flag, maps, dictionaries, and stationery are of course indispensable. In addition, it is best to bring some Chinese cultural materials and works of art, such as paintings, photos, embroidery, sculptures, and other small display items, which can not only be given as gifts, but also used to promote Chinese culture. Publications related to general information and various records are also very useful. Tea leaves can be duty-free if they are not more than five pounds. It is best to use green tea for gifts. Americans like floral fragrance and do not care much about the quality of the tea. In places where there are fewer Chinese students, there is more social interaction and more opportunities to give lectures. All kinds of things are useful. On the other hand, in places where there are many Chinese students, there is less social interaction, and everyone does not think that Chinese people are rare, and there is less communication. Those who are good at Chinese music may wish to bring some musical instruments and scores with them, which can be played sometimes. You can bring a "Steamer Trunk" and a suitcase for the suitcase. All kinds of domestic goods can be purchased, but you must not be greedy for cheap. It is not worth it if it is damaged halfway. If you plan to travel a lot in the United States, you can buy a suitcase for hanging clothes, otherwise it is not necessary.</p>

<h3>The Frenchman Teaches Chinese to the Stove</h3>
<p>In ancient China, there was Zhu Daosheng, who entered Tiger Hill and gathered stones as disciples to lecture on the Nirvana Sutra. Unexpectedly, there is a celebrity in France named Julien, who teaches Chinese to the stove. It can be said that it is a rare occurrence. Julien is quite proficient in Chinese characters, and the books he translated are too numerous to mention. Later, he was elected as a teacher of Chinese in a university. According to the rules of each teacher, he must often be in the college, reciting the essence of Chinese before receiving guests. When he first took office, he scheduled to give a lecture on Chinese literature every Thursday. After more than a month, no one came to listen. Only the stove facing each other in the empty hall was his companion every day. Julien still talked incessantly, as if the audience in the hall was crowded and overwhelming. How can the stove be expected to benefit from listening to the lecture? One day, suddenly many well-dressed men and women sat in rows and watched. Julien was overjoyed, thinking that from now on, Chinese literature would have the hope of revitalization. So Julien saw the women surrounding him, and simply talked generously to please them. He translated and began to lecture on a poem by Lin Hejing, which compared women to plum blossoms in Hangzhou. His posture was lively, and his words were eloquent, which was more vivid than when he was facing the stove in the empty hall. The listeners were delighted to see his expression, and they were all very happy. They were still laughing and jumping when they left! By the next lecture period, more guests came, including a scholar who had just arrived. Julien was very happy to see him, secretly thinking that he would get a faithful disciple here. He continued to teach for a quarter, and this scholar came with men and women every time, without missing a class, which was undoubtedly the most loyal disciple. When the quarter was over, someone told Julien: "This person is a guide in the French capital. Tourists visiting Paris want to appreciate the famous and strange sights. Your lecture to the stove is also listed among the strange sights, so he leads tourists to listen. And your lecture expression, Loswai spirited, tourists think it is indeed one of the strange sights, so they are quite satisfied."</p>

<h3>If Ah Q Were Born Today</h3>
<p>— Xu Xingzhi</p>
<p>This has become a monument to Chinese cultural studies, and Mr. Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q," which has caused a sensation in the world of literature, is not only a biography of a marginalized person, but also a picture of the declining Chinese rural life. It not only reflects the historical background of the Xinhai Revolution, but also writes about the decline of the feudal system, the collapse of the rural economy, and the social symptoms of capitalism invading the countryside.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun used his chisel-like, vivid pen and woodcut-like carved words to portray Ah Q and the "ghosts" around him in a vivid way. Although it is a rough-line prose, as a painter, I think it is a vivid "sketch" that is rare in ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I am not a sculptor and cannot carve out a three-dimensional Ah Q group portrait; nor am I an archaeologist to deeply explore Ah Q's family history. Because I am a theater worker who loves drama, I want to turn the "flat" Ah Q into a three-dimensional Ah Q, and turn the written Ah Q into a living Ah Q dressed up by actors. Therefore, my fiery passion for bringing "The True Story of Ah Q" to the stage has encountered many obstacles, but no one can stop me and cool my passion.</p>
<p>Although some people say that the time of Ah Q has passed, Ah Q and the "ghosts" around him have not completely disappeared in the Chinese countryside. The dregs of the sins of the feudal landlords, the rebellious traces of the comprador class's exploitation, and the ugly remnants of corrupt officials and bureaucrats are still rampant in the cities and villages of present-day China, and they are obstructing the war of resistance and the revolution in many ways. Wherever a certain force reaches, they often put on the clothes of puppets and take the stage.</p>
<p>If someone asks: What should Ah Q do if he were born today? This question has been considered in my mind for a long time. Finally, I believe that Ah Q would not be used as a "traitor" if he were born today. Because to be a "traitor," you must have the conditions of a "traitor," and Ah Q cannot be competent.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although he is unclear, he has a deep hatred and resentment towards local tyrants and evil gentry, corrupt officials and bureaucrats, compradores and their masters. Even though he did not explicitly express his determination to fight them, he never expressed his intention to surrender to their dark forces.</p>
<p>Moreover, in his low-energy mind, there often floats a yearning for "revolution," "Revolution, revolution, revolutionize the life of this bunch of mothers, too hateful! Too hateful!" This is precisely the voice of justice shouted from his heart. I think this kind of cry is stronger than his "son beating father" spirit of victory.</p>
<p>If Ah Q were born today, I believe that he might follow the hooligans and rascals to rob things after being drunk. He might listen to rumors and be terrified, and run away with a group of old and weak refugees. Maybe he would shout "Rebel! Rebel!" in the Tugu Temple and help the guerrillas do odd jobs. It depends on how the local anti-Japanese sentiment is and how it is reflected in his subconscious.</p>
<p>If the local guerrilla leadership is excellent, Ah Q will undoubtedly stand in the anti-Japanese camp. Otherwise, will he either escape or continue his wandering life as a marginalized person?</p>
<p>I believe that Ah Q will never volunteer to be a "traitor." I also believe that when a certain party or a traitor walks past him, he will at least spit on the ground in deep hatred and resentment to express his hatred for these heretics?</p>
<p>However, are such people the fighters we need now? Of course not, because Ah Q is simply not qualified to be a fighter for the anti-Japanese national salvation. However, on the other hand, should such people be shot? This is too much of an overdone work that buries humanity, right? Let's not forget that people will develop. If Ah Q were born today, would he be worse or better? At least he would be somewhat different from Ah Q during the Xinhai Revolution?</p>
<p>Everyone thought that Mr. Lu Xun shot Ah Q, but this is just a superficial explanation. You must know that it was not Mr. Lu Xun who shot Ah Q, but the dark forces of the local tyrants and evil gentry and corrupt officials and bureaucrats during the Xinhai Revolution. It was not the author of "The True Story of Ah Q" who sentenced Ah Q to death, but the chaotic era of the collapse of feudal society and the bankruptcy of the rural economy.</p>

<h3>Saving the Buds of the Nation</h3>
<p>— Starfire</p>
<p>Equal Emphasis on Education and Nurturing, Developing Life Skills</p>
<p>Reforming Habits, Enhancing Preparation for Life</p>
<p>Some children grow up in greenhouse-like families, while others are born to suffer the ravages of wind, frost, rain, and snow. Is there a difference in their nature? No, this is merely a symptom of the current societal illness and, at the same time, a disgrace to us adults.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the large number of homeless children has already become a serious social problem. Especially after the outbreak of war, refugees from various places flocked to the isolated island, further increasing the number of homeless children. They have not yet reached the age of self-reliance, and in extremely harsh environments, except for a very small number who become vendors or child laborers, most beg on the streets all day. When forced to, some even become petty thieves. Therefore, the issue of rescuing homeless children is becoming increasingly serious and urgent today.</p>
<p>In mid-February of this year, I saw the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association's plan to establish a beggars' education and nurturing home, and I knew that advanced people enthusiastic about social causes had already noticed the importance of educating and nurturing beggars and were carrying out this very meaningful work. At that time, in addition to feeling inspired, I also sincerely hoped that this plan would be realized soon. Recently, I received a report on the progress of the Beggars' Education and Nurturing Home (now named Shanghai Children's Home), and I learned that the home has appointed responsible personnel to begin raising funds for beggars' clothing and supplies. This news made the author feel infinitely happy—happy for the bright future filled with hope for the countless suffering children in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Here are a few personal opinions I would like to contribute to the gentlemen in charge of the Shanghai Children's Home, to express my sincere support:</p>
<p>Earnestly strive for equal emphasis on education and nurturing. In addition to imparting general knowledge, attention should be paid to developing life skills, reforming the behavior and character of beggars, so that they can support themselves after leaving the home and become good and promising citizens.</p>
<p>Cultivate the habit of perseverance and hard work, understand the current world and national trends, and enhance preparation for life.</p>
<p>Most of the suffering children who receive education and nurturing at the Children's Home have struggled and fought for a long time on the brink of starvation and cold. They possess the vitality to overcome their environment and are also eager to learn and progress. As long as we can teach according to their aptitude and enable them to develop their individual strengths, we will surely be able to cultivate many brilliant geniuses from the group of suffering children.</p>
<p>Children are the lifeblood of the nation, the buds of the nation. Child welfare has long been listed as an important policy in advanced countries. In an ideal society, homeless children would not exist. If someone attributes the tendency of suffering children to become thieves or loafers to their own unwillingness to learn or their inherently bad nature, then please read the fairy tale "The Watch" translated by Mr. Lu Xun. It will tell you how a homeless child repents in a new environment and becomes a child of the new era.</p>
<h3>(3) The Benefits of Closeness to God (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>— Xie</p>
<p>(1) Closeness to God is most beneficial to prayer and can foster a sense of awe and devotion in people. (2) Closeness to God gives us a firm belief in God and fearlessness towards enemies. Fearlessness towards enemies. We can endure all hardships because we know that God is near and will surely deliver us from our troubles. (3) Closeness to God can make people always happy. (4) Closeness to God will generate humility because the closer we are to God, the more we realize the difference between ourselves and God, and the more we realize God's infinite grace in giving us clothing, food, and shelter, so that we lack nothing. --Prayer-- Lord, help me not to forget my position because of wealth, not to forget God because of poverty, not to leave the Lord's path because of happiness, and not to disobey the Lord's command because of fear. Lord, may your spirit always be with me, giving me a loving heart, uprightness and impartiality, honesty and loyalty, filling me with the spirit of religion, hating evil as if it were an enemy, and following good as if it were flowing water. Also, Lord, make me humble and obedient, zealous and devout, not jealous of the good deeds of others, and at the same time, extremely self-respecting, not to be looked down upon by others. If I do wrong, Lord, teach me and correct me.</p>
<p>The above prayer can be read once a day to draw closer to God. --Shanghai Christian Literature Evangelism Society, P.O. Box 1227</p>
<h3>The Sky Clears After the Rain</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Thousands of Homes in the Countryside Cooperate in Fireworks, Myriad Miles of Waves Flying on the Ocean</p>
<p>In the Free Village, the most diligent efforts are put into two things: collectivism and cooperation. In terms of collectivism, they have collective farms, collective pig farms, collective chicken farms, and so on. They are also preparing to establish collective factories in the future. In terms of cooperation, they have consumer cooperatives, production cooperatives, and other cooperative enterprises that are also underway. In their village, there is a cooperative store, which initially had very little capital, only three hundred yuan when it was first opened. This was initiated by a nephew of the Village Chief Zhu. When it was launched, each share was five yuan, raising sixty shares. At that time, it was stipulated that each person could only have one share, so sixty people were gathered, which was also considered a trial run. The cooperative store sells daily necessities. When they first started, it was all a kind of game. Who knew that it would become an important consumer institution in the Free Village today? China has always had a so-called small grocery store, which exists in both urban and rural areas. In urban areas, it can be expanded into a department store, but large department stores are gradually becoming monopolies. In rural areas, however, it takes a convenience-oriented approach. When the Free New Village was first organized, there were some things they had to go to other towns to buy, which was inconvenient, wasn't it? Therefore, they organized this cooperative store, with sixty villagers as shareholders, stipulating the sale of sixty kinds of goods. The manager of this cooperative store is a cousin of Zhu Ai'ren, named Zhu Aili. He had not studied the essence of any cooperative law, nor had he graduated from any business school. They just said they were happy, so they did it. The Free Village also has a main street, with several more elaborate buildings on that street. There is also a postal agency, a bus station, a village assembly hall, a small vegetable market, and a newly established public education center, a village library, and so on. Zhu Aili borrowed a room next to the postal agency and set up this cooperative store. The first goods sold were all those light and handy daily necessities, such as soap, towels, envelopes, stationery, school supplies, household sundries, matches, candles, and the like. But later it expanded to include flashlights, rubber shoes, thermos bottles, as well as undershirts, socks, straw hats, yarn, children's toys, and so on. Initially, it was stipulated that there would be sixty kinds of goods, but now there are more than sixty kinds. Moreover, the capital of three hundred yuan was not enough, so it was expanded to a capital of one thousand yuan, with each share changed to ten yuan, still stipulating that each person could only buy one share, but if a family has eight people, regardless of age, perhaps they can have eight shares.

<h3>Three Variations on the Plum Blossom Theme</h3>
<p>— Sihua</p>
<p>Three Lovers Hao Naucy</p>
<p>This is a "delicacy" specially cooked by an American playwright for young masters. When the young masters are tired of playing with fashionable girls in the city, it tells you to taste the flavor of rural girls, the so-called "After eating delicacies, you feel that green vegetables and radishes are beautiful." What the playwright of "Three Variations on the Plum Blossom Theme" has brought out are "green vegetables and radishes," but "fragrant herbs" and "humor" have been added to the "green vegetables and radishes," so that the young masters are satisfied and smile when they see them. These are things that poor boys cannot imagine and have no time to think about. Only the "hunting for the unusual" minds of the young masters growing up in the golden country can create such an ideal "delicacy."</p>
<p>However, the American director's "fancy cake" is made brilliantly. It looks like a fictional story, but it is handled very compactly, lively, and humorously. Leaving aside the ideology, just talking about the technique, those vulgar Chinese directors should learn from it. For example: (1) When Lanxi was getting on the train, she dropped something. Nairishi went to get it for her, but when he turned around, the train had already started. Lanxi shouted on the train, and Nairishi chased after it on the station. The shot showed Nairishi's close-up of his eyes wide open (the lens zoomed out rapidly). (2) Nairishi took Lanxi to a dance. Lanxi casually nodded to a man sitting next to her. The man came over to greet her, but she said she didn't know him. Later, when she saw the burning dish, Lanxi thought it was an accident and rushed over to put it out with water, causing everyone to laugh. These scenes can make the audience laugh. But remember, it's not its boring content, it's its lively technique.</p>
<p>Among the three protagonists here, Meng Gaomao Lai's performance is the most humorous. His sleepwalking as he learns Fulanqi's dreamwalking, his godly smile after entering the quilt, and his facial expressions are also commendable. Lanxi and Luoba's family members meet, and his smug attitude is also vivid. Fulanqi plays Luoba, and his scenes are fewer than Meng Gaomao Lai's, with more ordinary scenes, but his personality is quite obvious. His drunken and confused look is very consistently maintained. Zhenni Gairuo, who plays Lanxi, works very hard, but her age shows that she is not very suitable for this character. At least, she doesn't bring out the youthful and lively taste of a rural girl in the first half of the play. Her appearance and movements are very urban.</p>

<h3>Mr. Feng Chaoran's Revised Poetry</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Chaoran is the Wang Shi Gu [a famous painter] of today. His small paintings are treasures sought after throughout the country. I have discussed painting with him at length, and he knows the origins and schools as if counting family treasures. In addition to painting and calligraphy, he also enjoys writing poetry. He once said that painting and calligraphy have no fixed value. If painting and calligraphy are regarded as merchandise, then the quality is inferior. But if painting and calligraphy are not the same as merchandise, I don't know what the world will regard them as. He also said: I have now revised the remuneration rates, slightly increasing them. People may be surprised by the high value, but today's things have all doubled in value, or even several times. Why can't painting and calligraphy be increased? Moreover, bustling people all seek their livelihood. I am also a human being, and I also depend on this for my porridge, clothing, and food. An ancient poem says: "I paint green mountains for you to buy, which is better than making evil money in the world." Therefore, those who are addicted to my paintings in the world will appreciate them and enjoy them all their lives, and I will take their value to feed my mouth, isn't it clear that I am not ashamed of my heart? I was deeply moved by his words, so I read Mr. Feng's recent poem on increasing the remuneration rates and wrote it down in a rambling way. Mr. Feng's poem is as follows:</p>
<p>In youth I did not learn swordsmanship, I rely on the writing brush for my livelihood, the world is difficult, it is still difficult to remove habits.</p>
<p>Du Fu suffered when writing poetry, Lu Gong had difficulty begging for rice, plowing the clouds and cultivating inkstones, relying on remuneration at the tip of the brush.</p>

<h3>Xun Huisheng is Coming South</h3>
<p>— Master of the Aiping Studio</p>
<p>Recently, it has been rumored in the local theater world that Xun Huisheng, one of the four famous Dan actresses, has been hired by a major theater in the city and will be coming south at the end of August. Is this news accurate? We will know later. Now, I will briefly describe Xun Huisheng's life as a prelude to his coming south, which I believe readers will be happy to hear!</p>
<p>Xun Huisheng, originally named Ci, styled Xuansheng, is from Dongguang, Zhili. He first entered the school of Pang Qihua to learn Qinqiang Huadan, and attended Zhengleshe as a supplementary student. He and Qingyi Shang Xiaoyun were known together. His initial stage name was "White Peony," because his supporters founded the White Society to promote him. His Erhuang Qingyi was taught by Xue Fen. His performance skills are truly excellent. Once he appears on stage, he can identify with the character in the play, lively and vivid, with drama all over his body. Now, I will briefly describe his singing, dialogue, and acting to introduce him:</p>
<p>(1) Singing: Xun Huisheng's singing is as gentle as a woman, without the vigor of Mei (Lanfang) and Shang (Xiaoyun), but purely wins with gentleness. It is moist and tactful, rising and falling freely, without showing any dryness. This can be demonstrated by the play "Yu Tang Chun." Almost all Qingyi actresses can perform the play "Yu Tang Chun," but it is rare for one person to perform the entire play. The three of the four famous Dan actresses, Mei, Shang, and Cheng, have never sung the entire play, only performing "Qijie" and "Huishen." At most, they sing to "Tuanyuan." Only Xun Huisheng starts from "Piaoyuan," including "Shuzhuang," "Miaohui," "Beipian," "Qijie," "Huishen," "Tanjian," and ending with "Datianyuan." One person plays Yu Tang Chun. The singing and acting are heavy, but he never tires, making people amazed.</p>
<p>(2) Dialogue: Xun Huisheng's dialogue interacts with his acting. His facial expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, and joy also follow. He is very able to understand the psychology and temperament.</p>
<p>(3) Acting: Xun Huisheng's acting is the best among the four famous Dan actresses. He really puts himself in the shoes of the character in the play. Whether he plays a daughter of a noble family or a girl from a small family, he can vividly and wonderfully convey the heart of a girl, and he is considerate and meticulous, but he does not cross the line of love and reason, and does not involve frivolity. This is even more difficult.</p>
<p>(4) Martial Arts: Xun Huisheng has had a foundation in martial arts since he was a child. Because he had also learned Qinqiang, he also worked hard on the stilt work. Therefore, the beauty of his stilt work is unparalleled except for Yu Lianquan (Xiao Cuihua). For example, in the second book of "Hong Ni Guan," Dongfang Shi's climbing the tent (Huisheng plays "Hong Ni Guan," always playing Dongfang Shi by himself, unlike other troupes where the first part of Dongfang Shi and the second part play the maid.), and Zou Shi's falling in "Zhan Wan Cheng," the stability and beauty of his skills show that his martial arts are beyond the reach of others.</p>
<p>(5) Appearance: Xun Huisheng's appearance is beautiful, charming, and gentle, giving people a sense of beauty. Especially the expression in the corners of his eyes and eyebrows almost makes people suspect that he is not a man. It can also be seen that his appearance has reached perfection!</p>
<p>The above five items are only a brief description, and they are not enough to describe even one percent of his art. What is even more surprising is the large number of new plays, which can be called "second to none." These new plays are all very elegant in compilation and do not involve any roughness. There are dozens of them, such as "Xi Hu Zhu," "Hong Li Ji," "Qintou Feng," "Dan Qing Yin," "Yuanxiao Mi," "Xiu Xiao Ji," "Huan Zhu Yin," "Xiang Luo Dai," "Jing Chai Ji," "Liu Rushi," "Yizhang Qing," and "Hong Lou Eryou." The playwrights, such as Chen Moxian and Chen Jianxi, are all famous playwrights. Therefore, the value of these new plays is also extraordinary!</p>
<p>Huisheng's fame is mostly due to his acting skills, but he has also benefited from the constant emergence of new plays. He has not been to Shanghai for seven or eight years! If the news of his coming south is true, then these wonderful plays will be presented to the theater-loving gentlemen of Shanghai to satisfy their thirst!</p>
<h3>Actors, Amateurs, and Movie Stars at the New New Radio Station</h3>
<p>— Haisheng</p>
<p>Participating in a Broadcast Charity Sale for the Epidemic Hospital</p>
<p>From 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, figures from the acting, amateur, and movie star worlds gathered at the New New Radio Station to hold another broadcast charity sale for the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital. Because there were movie stars participating, the situation seemed to be more lively. He and she called on many movie fans, who all donated money to the radio station to visit. There was also an honorary seat, which was specially given to the most generous donors.</p>
<p>This new New New Radio Station is located in a tea room. The broadcast room is completely made of glass, so people sitting outside can both hear and see. On this day, the comrades from the acting, amateur, and movie star worlds all showed their true faces clearly in front of the audience. From the perspective of the visitors, the people broadcasting in the glass room looked like tropical fish.</p>
<p>This time, the amateur group was responsible for the organization. People like Bao Xiaodie, Yuan Senqi, Zhang Zhongyuan, Wu Benshan, and Wang Qijun were all busy with reception and reporting work. There were also many famous amateurs who came to participate in the broadcast.</p>
<p>The movie stars' broadcasting time started at 5:00 p.m. Zhang Shichuan and Liu Jiqun were the first to report to the radio station. Then Zhang Shankun and Tong Yuejuan, Lu Ming, Xu Qinfang, Wang Xianzhai, Han Lan'yao, Yin Xiucen, Gong Jianong, Wang Jiting, Hong Jingling, etc. were also successively picked up by cars sent by the hospital. The most notable for movie fans were Yin Xiucen, Han Langen, and Liu Jiqun, three treasures. When they sang "Wang Laowu" together, their strange appearances made the visitors laugh non-stop. Among the influence there are many who sing Peking opera, Wang Xianzhai, whom we consider to be a "bad guy," also sang a section of Qingyi.</p>
<p>From 8:15 p.m., the amateur actors continued to broadcast and sing. Qilin Tong and Gao Baisui both came with their wives. Yan Jupeng sat for a while and left without singing. His daughter, Miss Huizhu, sang a piece of "June Snow," with her brother Shaopeng playing the zither in cooperation. Until 3:00 a.m., the person in charge thanked the audience and reported the results. This charity sale was a complete success.</p>

<h3>Star Six Star Chronicle Four - Jin Lili</h3>
<p>The other day, Master Ti telegraphed me, saying that he usually does not like to dance and does not read dance articles, but he enjoys your works because they are well-observed and full of fun. I didn't expect Master Ti to be so intelligent, but he was deceived by me. My dancing skills are clumsy, and I am restricted by the curfew at home, so I dare not comment on dance skills, nor do I have time to explore all the secrets in the dance floor. Like a butcher cooking meat, I feel a lack of main raw materials, and I have to piece them together and add some spices. Ha ha.</p>
<p>Last year, when I first came to the metropolis, a senior friend said to me, "If you want to know which dancer here is the lightest, I said, "It's easy to know, the short and exquisite ones are light." It got to the point where he asked him to introduce me, saying "Jin Lili." Try to dance with her. It's as if there is no one in front of you, but in reality, there is someone. It was magical. After being amazed for a long time, I heard the reason. He said, "Just study hard." I remember that a musician, for every piece of music, cannot show it to others unless he has played it more than a thousand times. Therefore, Lili's words are not careless.</p>
<p>Lili's figure is moderate, not one of the skinny and weak ones. Her appearance is only average, but her words are gentle, and her demeanor is generous, not arrogant or mean, a top choice. In the spring, the Paramount held an election for the top ten dancers, and Lili was one of them. She is not good at reading, and she is said to be willing to engage in science. She has no special love for Peking opera, she can already hum some tunes. Her voice is sweet, with a wide range, unlike a woman. Later, I don't know from where she heard my name and asked to study with me. I praised her ambition and agreed, but I was actually ashamed. Many of the small details were not corrected.</p>
<p>The other day, Lili asked someone to invite me to drink at her residence. When I arrived, her manager came out to greet me, and he seemed familiar. Lili showed me a photo, with twelve people in it. The person in the middle was my father, with me and Xiaocun sitting on either side. The Jin's manager was standing behind my father. It was about ten years ago, so the Jin's manager was once a student of mine. Now Lili is my student again, there must be a reason. When Jin's mother heard that I had arrived, she also came out to greet me, speaking with a Pudong accent. Mother and son both muttered that they never thought that they would have a livelihood, relying on Lili's efforts. They couldn't help but sob! Jin also sighed with emotion! Then I comforted her, saying that the dance floor is a good place to choose a good husband. With Lili's steadiness, wisdom, and resourcefulness, there is no need to worry about her falling into the lower reaches. At that time, Lili turned her face away, as if she were sobbing. I couldn't bear to talk about it anymore, so I turned to ask about her family. According to her, her father has been unemployed for almost thirty years. The person who supports the family after her father is her manager. He has served in the military in Fujian for many years. When the war started, he engaged in various businesses, taking on the burden alone, and now it is all on Lili's shoulders, and Lili is suffering. Her mother also knows that Lili is suffering, so she has her niece and younger brother help her, and she is also eager to choose a husband for her. I said, "Do you know how difficult it is to choose a husband?" She said, "I know, but what should I do?" I said, "Do you mean that once Lili finds a good husband, the family's livelihood will be guaranteed by the husband, and Lili's heavy burden can be relieved?" Jin's mother nodded happily and said, "Sir, your words are what I think." I said, "Wait a minute. Do you know that your husband must bear the burden of your Jin family's life, and also bear the burden of his own family's life? One person lives, and dozens of people eat. How can your husband's suffering be described? If your husband suffers, can Lili not suffer? If you become a concubine for a rich man, buying a concubine is like a merchant buying goods. Once her beauty fades, she will be discarded like worn-out shoes. Will your family be guaranteed what it depends on? Therefore, your family should plan to be frugal. Those who have worked before should not refuse low salaries to find a way out. Lili should choose a husband who can support her all the time as the main thing, and who can support the family to a certain extent as the second thing." At this point, Lili suddenly smiled and asked, "Can reading more books help you know people's hearts?" I recited Su Dongpo's sentence in reply, "If you believe that ten thousand differences return to one principle, you now know me, and I know the fish," and chose the meaning for her.</p>
<h3>Prelude to the Performance of "The True Story of Ah Q"</h3>
<p>— Gao Feng</p>
<p>After the May Fourth Movement, it became even more sensational. The word was praised by world-famous writers and the world's literary circles and translated into English and Russian numbers. The "True Story of Ah Q", which is praised as the representative work of Chinese literature, will be performed by the Sino-French Drama Society at the Lafayette Road Lafayette Garden Theater today (15th).</p>
<p>"The True Story of Ah Q" is the most successful work in Lu Xun's early writing career. The success of "The True Story of Ah Q" lies in its profound depiction and sharp pen. Ah Q is the most common typical character in Chinese folk. This kind of character still exists today. Lu Xun wrote this novel twenty years ago, but this novel has not lost its dynasty nature until now.</p>
<p>Ah Q is a "winner" in the spiritual victory method. For example, several times, he was grabbed by his enemies (the writing object and era of the book were still in the late Qing Dynasty.) and beaten severely. Ah Q was unable to resist and let them beat him severely. After being beaten, he saw that the enemy had gone far away, and he dared to stand up and mutter, "Damn it, after all, I was beaten by my son. This world is getting more and more out of shape,"...to comfort himself.</p>
<p>The content of "The True Story of Ah Q" includes his whole life experience and career, from working as a long-term worker to being shot, all of which is very vivid and hilarious. The subject matter is of course serious, but the description is very relaxed. Now this novel has been adapted into a play by Xu Xingzhi, and the Sino-French Drama Society will perform it at the Lafayette Theater. It is unknown how well it will be received, but it will undoubtedly attract the attention of the isolated island people!</p>

<h3>The Words of a Villain (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Wang Xianzai</p>
<p>"A Villain's" Original Intention and Expectations</p>
<p>My original profession was as a Western-style ophthalmologist. I practiced in Shanghai for several years—my medical name was Wang Youting. At that time, there were few practitioners of Western medicine, and Western ophthalmology was especially rare. Although being a doctor is also a kind of work that benefits the masses, I thought it was ultimately one-sided. It did not have the broad reach to the public that theater and film do as tools for educating society. I had a deep love for theater work from my early days as a student. Later, coinciding with the budding and nascent opportunity for domestic films, I resolutely abandoned my original profession and wholeheartedly began to devote myself to this new career.</p>
<p>I determined from the start that filmmaking would be my lifelong career. Therefore, no matter how bad the environment, like the entire domestic film industry falling into difficulties in the past, often panicking over unpaid salaries to the point where living became a problem, I still bore it gladly and never had the slightest thought of seeking a better plan. Because my entire life had long been entrusted to this career. If it were merely for the sake of making a living, or for the sake of enjoying pleasure, then as a doctor until now, I should have long had a car to ride in and a foreign house to live in. I fundamentally would not have given up my original profession.</p>
<p>Now, under the extraordinary circumstances of this extraordinary period, everyone feels deeply distressed. Generally, people curse me as a "villain" with heinous crimes, but the actual villains are actually ten or a hundred times worse than my performances on screen. At present, there are many realistic dramas, but regrettably the environment does not allow me to give a thorough and delightful performance. Otherwise, if I could vent my pent-up sorrow and indignation from this, I think it would definitely be more brilliant than the many villains I have played before. However, this is purely due to the plot. Speaking of which, it really feels too heartbreaking!</p>
<p>Finally, my feeling is that I hope the entire environment, as well as the social situation, can soon improve. So that this "villain" on the screen can also reform his behavior as soon as possible and no longer have any opportunities to do evil.</p>
