<h3 id="c20">踟蹰之日本 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>上月初，日本首相阿部，外相野村，在彼地方長官會議席上，宣述外交方針：對於美國，謂將「繼續努力，俾美國能充分理解日方眞意」。上週杪，東京電稱，日本擬於本星期，與美國試行談判；故美日關係之趨好或惡化，胥將於本星期內決定之。及至前晚，日本同盟社東京電稱：美日會談討論問題有（一）一般在華權益問題，（即九國公的開放門戶，機會均等原則，開放租界，長江珠江通航等問題）（二）美日商的問題。（三）太平洋和平保障問題。又稱日政府認為使英美認識新秩序問題為解決事件之捷徑，故將由日政府與關係方面充分交換意見，先向英美進行此項工作云。同盟社另電稱：外務省當局於三十日午復六時半，繼續午前之會談，在外相官邸，重開首腦會議，由野村外相主席，賡續協議，關於對付日英日美交涉上，日本應採步驟與方針。凡上敘述，皆以日本官方消息或半官消息為根據：日本當前之「心事」如何，洵可謂情見乎辭者矣。</p>
<p>顧乃日本外務省發言人須磨忽又根本吾認其說，言誌昨報；更撮舉其要旨如次：</p>
<p>「日政府並無在目前與英美兩國開始正式或非正式談話、以解決各項懸案之意嚮、且亦從未作此嘗試、渠擬將日本各報、所引起日美及日英間會談、不日卽將舉行之印象、予以消除、英大使克萊琪、曾與外次谷正之會晤、惟此項談話、一部份係屬例行公事、與外傳日本與英美之談判、並無關係、野村外相不日或將與美大使格魯會晤討論例行事件、但此項晤談之用意亦非開始美日間之正式談判外傳珠江及揚子江、將早日開放、以供外輸航行之消息、此不過一種推測而已、日政府當局、包括外務省在內、目下對於此類事件、並未考慮及之、預料中國之新「政權」將在一個月內成立、中國「新中央政府之建立、將可廓淸遠束之局勢、日本已決定之政策、卽為援助中國「新中央政府」使其作穩健之發展、」</p>
<p>「外務」「發言」者，合格之謊語也；無可奈何，諉諸各報，謂非別有難言之隱藏？以意度之：或因期望與英美談判而試探失敗、爰予否認：或因談判絕無把握，故秘密接觸，豫留失敗後盤旋之餘地；或因關於開放通航諸問題，日本內部意見紛歧矛盾，不能統一，既無法與英美進行談判，遂不得不諱考慮；或因萃其全部希望於『政治攻勢』之迷夢，以為亦得自拔於泥淖，而奢望之以廓淸遠東。凡上測度，原非可以武斷之為必然，然有蛛絲馬跡可尋，可信為不中不遠。抑吾認云云，雖因難言之隱，而日本心事之所亟，乃在企圖融化英美而希冀開始談判，則絕非合格之謊語所得而吾認者也。故吾認為一事，追求開談之機會而立即進行談判為又一事，吾人未可以其否認而視為無復談判之舉；要知阿部登台，野村出馬，實以覓致外交途徑打通英美為彼等理想之序幕也。</p>
<p>以吾人從旁觀察：日本深知陷於泥淖，故亟求自拔；所惜乎絕無壯士斷腕之勇氣，幡然改圖之智慧；日暮途遠，毫無辦法。析言之：始願以軍事攻勢，不顧一切以解決一切，及至第三年而軍事攻勢成强弩之末；繼謀以政治攻勢不顧一切，以造就一切既成事實，詎知內則未能得心應手，外有不容不顧之沉重壓力；於是為完成其侵略之局部事功計，不得不求外交攻勢與政治攻勢之相配合。彼須磨所謂「中國新中央政府之建立，將可廓淸遠東之局勢」，與同盟社電稱「日政府認為使英美認識新秩序問題，為解決事件之捷徑」。此即期待配合之自白也。夫英美有英美之政策，美國政策允堅定，絕非日本外交之策略術數所得而搖撼；日本不自省悟而乞靈外交，徒見其心勞日拙，終必絕無成就，我人既屢屢言之矣；雖然，倘若所傳美日即將開始談判云云而竟實現，則日本得一機會，由美國耳提面命。我人固希望美國循循善誘，日本或因此恢復其理智，則在美國亦未謂徒勞也。倘若日本必視此為外交攻勢，則日本必得更切實之敎訓於談判之後：而談判者，亦不失為日本日暮途遠，漸趨落沒中之又一階段者也。</p>
<p>日人非必絀於理智，徒以利令智昏，遂至支離滅裂。試以彼之政治策略證之；美聯社冊日東京電傳「日本外務省發言人今日在此間宣稱；統治日軍佔領區之新中央政府，將於一月內設立」云云，路透社同日東京電傳，日本外務省發言人須磨謂「新中央政府之建立，將可廓淸遠東局勢」云云，其間既謂佔領區，又謂新中央，此在意識如何矛盾不可通？即僅責以統治佔領區，又復期以郭淸遠東，論名論實，空間不楴距離萬千里，此在意識又如何不可通？尊佔領區之組織曰新中央，尊新中央之職權曰統治：更復將獨立也，平等也，主權也，種種實用於國家國際之名詞，舉以相宜；凡此者，我人無不習聞其言辭；顧乃何為而亟亟與英美在東京談判，代謀權利問題，門戶問題？夫何以支離滅製至於斯極哉？曰想吞，又捨不得不吞。曰想不吞，又想試吞。此種患得患失之神態，不可掩飾。若謂不復想，不復吞，則至今日為止，毫無憑證</p>

<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>倫敦特約通信</p>
<p>（六）混沌中參戰國態度的索引</p>
<p>上一决歐洲大戰後，世界各國，由之，由得到了種種的敎訓；而在外交的範疇內，最大的，却有兩點：一點，是反對戰前的秘密外交，另一點，却是反對各國間分頭締結同盟，形成彼此的對抗。戰後產生的國際聯盟，在任務上，是包含掃除這兩點的殘餘使命在內的。後一點，因為德·日·意。集團的勾結，而完全全廢棄了：牠們同時又都走出了國聯。前一點呢，在去年春天艾登英外相未辭職前，除了侵略集團外，其餘各國間的外交，多多少少，還是可以循着國聯的途徑，以堂堂正正的姿態，來進行的。然而，艾登一辭職，英國張伯倫首相，却奉行了秘密外交。這一年來秘密外交特別活躍的是功是罪，已經由這一决的大戰，加以具體的證明，同時，道也不在我這一段文章的範圍之內，現在且不說。在這裹要指出來的，是情勢發展到這一次大戰的前夜，秘密外交在歐洲的猖獗，實在到了一個可怕的程度。因此，雖然在今天，大戰巳經算是爆發了，我們要想瀲底明瞭各國眞實態度，還是完全不可能。還有，除了秘密外交而外，又多了一個近些年來特別發達的，各國宣傳武器的活躍。這，替一切國際的活動，又加上了一層遮掩，而形成了當前的眞象的混沌不明。</p>
<p>然而正因為如此，我們更有透過萬花鏡一般迷惑的表皮，去一看事實眞象的必要。在以下，我將根據現有的資料，以個人判斷及與大家討論的結果為工具，先來對這點，作一個大概輪廓描繪的嘗試。當然，這並不是寫歷史，以後續有所得時，打算隨時再補充，也許是修正。</p>
<p>第一·德國的進攻波蘭</p>
<p>一年前的大的也是這個時候，希特拉鼓動而且帮助波蘭，在捷克對德割讓蘇台德區時，也乘火打刦，强割了台孫附近的捷克一片領土。春天，波蘭柏克外長訪德時，希特拉當面提出歸併但澤自由市。在波蘭接受英國担保安全後，希特拉開始了拉攏波蘭工作。英波互助協定簽字後，又通過了墨索里尼，加强了對波拉攏工作，而且用了相當的恫嚇。這時，已到了這一次戰爭的前夜了</p>
<p>可是，像一個閉了好久，好久，好久之後的戲慕似的，在大家等得不耐煩的時候，却突然揭了慕；而允其出於一般人意料之外，出現在台上的，却是一齣德國進攻波蘭！</p>
<p>德國進攻波蘭？——這是不可想像的事！是在德國方面，有百弊而沒有一利的事！德·波·之間的關係上說，希特拉像諸葛亮似的，揮淚斬掉了馬謖，在英·法·與德國之間的關係上說，以及蘇·德·間關係上說，今而後，他是騎上了虎背。</p>
<p>外交運用上，英·法·最希望的，就是德國的進攻波蘭。德國近幾個月來，隱忍者，一再把歸併但澤延期的，也就是提防會和波蘭引起全面戰爭。波蘭敢於十二分的强哽，有恃而無恐的，更加是，斷定了德國不會對牠用兵。許多的觀察家，對於其他國際未來形勢的演變，容或有所爭論，而對於這一點，則一致的結論：是妥協的可能，超出戰爭的可能。可是，事實畢竟十事實，德國終於進攻波蘭了！（未完）</p>

<p>長沙通信、襟江帶湖的湘陰、是湘北濱湖區域一個最富有詩情畫意的城、城作橢圓形、城的周圍、雖僅四里許、由於環城的遍植垂楊、每當春夏、樹木葱鬱、加以江湖水漲、遙望湘陰城、宛如置身水中央的一塊青苔、一葉綠萍、「臥虹堤影東西水、夾鏡湖光上下天」、「淺綠雙湖生夕浪、殘紅八景駐斜陽」、「遠浦帆收千頃碧、夕陽晚照一江紅」、這種種都是前人留給我們對於湘陰的插畫、</p>
<p>長沙大火之後、長沙一部被災難民、彙集到湘陰、使侷處湖濱密邇火線的湘陰城、反趨繁榮起來、今歲一連半載餘、湘北的平靜無事、加以自公路鐵路破壞後、來往湘北的唯一交通、即由水路泛湘江、這樣、湘陰反因戰事恢復了他往昔的繁榮、湘陰城也顯得特別活躍起來了、在繁榮復興中的湘陰、剛剛度過了舊曆端午節、（六月二十一日）在汨羅江版憑弔了三問大夫屈原後、誰提防於六月二十三日·四兩日、日機每日各十五架、竟以平民區的湘陰城、作爲轟炸目標呢、因爲防空設備簡陋等到於沒有、由於城區四周多水、躲避無從、致經兩日五次日機更番瘋狂轟炸、全湘陰城區所有房舍、十之八九、皆被炸焚一空、居民一家一戶、甚至整個一條街巷的被炸被焚、或被活埋在瓦礫堆裹了、民衆死傷共達三千、損失之鉅、超過了湘省任何城鎮遭過空襲的記錄、</p>
<p>湘陰被轟炸後月餘、各大街雖經清掃、在各瓦礫上間或亦已建立起茅房木舍、一部難民們、在經營他們微博的營業、藉以延續其微弱的生命、但經視勘了整個區域後、深覺其所遭損失、如以比例言、遠較長沙大火爲鉅、城內唯一大建築商皇宏達燦然爛然甲於湖南的文廟、亦被命中數彈、頹垣破瓦、斷梁殘磚、觸目淒然、</p>

<p>湘陰是左宗棠郭嵩　的故里、武事人文、素所兼重、尤其是武事、因爲民氣的發皇、如勇毅敢任、若能因勢利導、加强其民族國家意識、確是干城之寄、無奈過去地方當局推行兵役的不踏實、有錢者一錢買壯丁替代兵役、有勢者更將十八歲以上二十五歲一下年齡縮至十八歲一下二十六歲以上、四十歲以下年齡增值四十六歲以上、以這種方法來逃避兵役以致無錢無勢力者、亦多裹足不前、望望然而遠之、而「抽壯丁」、遂一變而爲「捉壯丁」、戰事延入贛鄂後、湘省各縣、復有「自衛國」之組織、但自衛隊經費、多係每月向民間臨時攤派、而非統籌、致養了很多人去從事專收取自衛經費、弊端百出、糾紛時起、結果「自衛」適成了「自擾」、這種現象、直延續到日軍	侵陷岳陽、湘陰業已成爲逼近火線的第一線後、始逐漸被改過來。尤其民衆。在縣城兩度急驟轟炸的血的教訓中、增加了他們對於日軍侵略的進一步認識、他們不但自己永不會忘記、並將以這慘痛的經歷、流傳給沒一個子孫、成爲一個以資警惕的故事、自此徵兵困難減少了、自衛隊經費的紛爭也沒有了、民衆且多自願的擔任自衛工作、因爲他們都已明瞭每個民衆應盡的義務、應負的責任、</p>
<p>日軍如欲利用洞庭、利用湘江、向湘省腹部進攻、則湘陰爲共首現在所必爭的所在、但在這裹、每個河　、每個港灣、都已經華軍層層封鎖、每個土阜、每個嵩　、都有華軍堅固的工事和堡壘、每個匹夫匹婦、都已自覺起來、從事實際的保鄉保衛工作、所以、最近的湘北戰線、可以說是固若金瓦了、</p>

<p>（一）設施多消遺性質、少有教育意義、（二）設施付錢龐雜、誤宣傳活動爲教育目的、（三）工作太散漫、（四）事業無中心、（五）施教區域太大、（六）無固定對象、（七）設施多蹈空不合需要、（八）主持人多不能認識問題之核心、（九）偏重館內、忽視館外、（十）未能真到民間去、（十一）大多數民教館都設在城市、（十二）不能相機訓練與組織民衆、（十三）只重量的發展、而少量的改進、（十四）工作計劃多主於主管而擬定者、</p>
<p>上面所舉的兩個例子、一個是教育行政機關所發表的、一個是各地從事民教人士所發表的、很可以表示民衆教育館的一般困難和缺點、</p>

<p>（重慶航訊）重慶市社會局奉到教育部二十八年五月頒佈之「民衆教育館規程」後、既於本年六月遵章選委員館長、於是該館遵照規定、擬定各項章則、選用幹練職員、成立總務·生計·藝術·四部、編印章則兩則、工作大綱及日曆一冊、自六月上旬開始實施、於今四閱月、其工作之可得言者如次、</p>
<p>一、中心工作——掃除文盲——重慶市原設有戰時民衆補習教育推行委員會、負責設立民衆學校掃除文盲之實、會所即設於民衆教育館內、民教館既以掃除本市文盲爲中心工作、於是盡力協助推行會籌設民校、並急急實施民教館之文字教育、如出版民衆壁報、擴充民衆圖書閱覽室、舉辦有組織之識字運動、設立民衆問字代筆處、創製巡迴文庫車、於各特約民衆茶園添置書報流通處、於各交通路口設置流動之通俗講演站、皆所以致力於文盲之掃除也、至成立高等讀書會、則又屬進一步提高文化水準工作之一、</p>
<p>二、一般工作——除中心工作——掃除文盲外、其他一般工作、上有協進自治、提倡生產、增進健康、改良風俗、指導娛樂、及戰時後方工作諸大端、在最近四月之內、已經舉辦者、有設立自治常識講座、推行各種紀念日活動、小本貸款介紹處、職業介紹所、各業工友訓練班、店員職員補習班、整頓公共體育場、舉辦拒毒運動、節約運動、設置收音室、特約茶園、象棋競賽、繪圖研究會、一月研究會、以及各項抗戰宣傳、圖畫展覽、徵募寒衣、慰勞傷兵、及出征軍人家屬等等、凡一事未辦之先、皆有精密計劃、正辦之時、復有審慎周詳之組織與步驟、故結果均告圓滿、是以支援精神愉快、社會率多讚美云、</p>

<p>英文大美晚報云、滬西居民、昨（三十日）夜與今（三十一日）晨、聞斷續而猛烈之砲聲、先自靑沛方面發出、旋經徐家匯火車站傳來、夜間被此巨聲驚醒者、不乏其人、今晨五時三十分至十時三十分之間、雖有都市生活之喧囂、仍聞猛烈之轟聲、並見徐家滙車站方面因砲火而起之邊烟與爆炸、</p>
<p>青浦戰事　移至近郊</p>
<p>查徐家滙車站、係在滬杭鐵路上、已往數週內、該鐵路被游擊隊截斷者、非止一次、據今晨所得簡略消息、日軍與遊擊隊昨夜曾在虹橋飛機塲以西沿靑浦公路上發生激戰、作戰地旋向滬杭鐵路移至徐家匯車站近郊、衆信游擊隊於破曉後、不得不繼續作戰、而向鐵路區引退、以期與其他正規軍取得接觸、而抗日軍之攻擊、</p>
<p>龍華一帶　日軍密佈</p>
<p>據南市傳來華人消息、南市日軍、昨日午後散佈於龍華路一帶、並見日軍頗為活動、卡車若干輛、載小鋼砲向上海西南面駛去、大批輕重機槍、亦已運往該區、</p>
<p>滬杭一帶　時有激戰</p>
<p>上海日陸軍發言人今日聲稱、嘉興日駐軍自十月十五日起、在該城附近廣博之區域中、實行驅逐游擊隊行動、而在嘉興東北三十公里之西塘與陶莊間、與華方新編第三十師之第八團交綏、日兵死四名、傷九名、十月十五日、日軍在滬杭鐵路上楓涇東南十公里處、與游擊隊交戰兩决、互有傷亡、</p>
<p>華正規軍　開砲臺灣</p>
<p>茲據寳山來客談、寳山城內、前本駐有日軍百餘名、但邇來因湘北晋西各戰錢、均吿吃緊、故巳抽調一空、僅留日軍十餘名、及日籍顧問中島與特務員數名而已、此外有偽警二十餘名、尙有當地無賴份子所組成之偽車、敲詐勒索、無所不為、前日偽「縣政府」擬强迫各街保長呈報戶口、抽徵壯丁、以供日方犧牲、城中居民、聞訊大起恐慌、相率避走、地保亦遷至他處暫避、現偽「政府」權力僅及城內、離城一二里、即在遊擊隊控制中、又寳山城東南之砲台灣、新近到達華武裝隊五千餘人、配備齊全、並在該處搆築工事、當地居民、願為服役者、並付給以相當代價、聞華軍一俟時機成熟、即將連絡四郊遊擊隊、總攻縣城、</p>

<p>向北猛攻</p>
<p>中，東安鎭前曾為日軍登岸侵入、但經華軍猛烈反攻後、日軍以死亡過多即登艇逃竄、由此次戰事發生以來、因華軍進　規模範圍、均較往昔為大、故日軍極為恐慌、一星期來、鐵路公路、日軍運頻繁、且在城中拉伕甚烈、城中居民、被拉者已有四百餘人、復自蘇州等處拉來二三百人、故一般居民、亦皆恐慌萬分、全城街市、中下流社會男子、幾將絕跡、凡</p>

<p>抽調偽軍　開赴前綫</p>
<p>駐防於兩路沿綫之日軍、兵力本極單薄、近來華方游擊隊襲擊兩路交通、日軍幾於無法應付、茲悉日軍頃將新在滬郊所募集之偽軍一千餘人、令其分別開往常州·杭州·等處、並更換日軍服裝、藉以虛張聲勢、</p>
<p>夜間日偽　結隊梭巡</p>
<p>滬西日本憲兵隊及偽警察大隊、頃以滬郊開到華正規軍甚多、聲勢日見浩大、為愼防遭華軍殲滅、苟延殘喘起見、業巳於前夜起採取特殊戒備、分成若干小隊、全副開裝出動、沿途梭巡、行動詭秘、聚散不琮、充分若干小恐慌、殊屬可笑、其情形愈見緊張、愚園路極司非而路宵禁斷絕行人、各里弄口均有便衣隊或偽警崗位、手擎步槍、故作森嚴</p>

<p>近來南市邊區及上海縣治之滬閔公路及昆運滬西一段遊擊隊活躍、已儘入日軍控制之心臟區域、且公開檢查奸宄、限制糧食入日軍區域、日軍一過公路綫、即不敢深入、加以駐國多調出、不敷支配、新補充之少年兵、未經戰塲、稚氣膽怯、益來敢進攻、故軍隊反而退集於高昌廟龍華路一帶、惟每日兩次搬出小鋼砲機關槍大隊人馬、在龍華路上如打靶子式之開放、為時已近一週、但一至下午五時、即一律集中其高昌廟兵工廠內之司令部中、不越雷池一步、</p>

<p>英文大美晚報云、三井會社搶蛋事、經報端揭露後、三井會社、已於今日（三十一日）晨通知某美商蛋類裝罐商行、謂該行被搶之蛋兩批、共計逾一百籃、刻在黃浦路三井會社倉庫中者、當予歸還、惟該商行須出示正確之載運單、與芷當之保證、就其他徵象觀之、英美商行在長江口所購蛋類、甫經運到、與一二日內抵滬者、當可送交</p>
<p>合法原主</p>
<p>查三井會社在近數週內所搶英美商行七家之蛋、已逾三十萬元、若三井會社今即停止其搶蛋行動、則該七商行已閉門之工塲、可立即復工、此等商行、刻並要求以蛋類償還其被攫之蛋、而不願得</p>

<p>擊破出售</p>
<p>故英美商行已無從收回其大多數失蛋矣、同時、由於三井會社壟斷長江口之蛋類供給、故匕海公共市塲、蛋類已見缺少、所能購得之少數蛋類、乃自浦東及</p>

<p>「自由中國」諸省，近來在農業方面的改進，也已顯示良好的結果，大多數區域，有由政府銀行以信用放款貸予新成立的農村合作社的，或是已實行有系統的種子改良的都已大增收穫。雲南廣博的區域中，已種植穀類，以代罌粟，幾十年來該省雅片產量，以本年為最少。「自由中國」境內的棉花，大豆，茶葉，和甘蔗的收穫，都已增加。各地雖嚴禁農民車輛使用新汽車路，但是新的卡車業務，已給祇一年前還在與外界隔絕中生活的數萬村莊開闢新市塲和供給來源。</p>
<p>當然，「自由中國」境內經濟發展的艱鉅工作，還待日後努力，但巳往十二個月的偉大成就，無疑的已使「自由中國一的每一個村落，城市和省份，現在都有新的經濟生活而迅速大步邁進。「自由中國」各區至今還祇小部份受到新經濟發展的良效，各省多數區域中人民的經濟活動，還未經新紀兀的氣息觸及，而生活跟舊時一樣的繼續進行着。許多村落仍如舊態，數百哩新汽車公路，蜿蜓經過全未開發的鄉野。許多縣城中守舊的居民，依然瞠目瞧着各省中心地間新的全程交通，並不自下決心，照新局勢和新情况的需要而生活。</p>
<p>然而「自由中國」的新經濟發展却是事實，它的前進，已遠過一年前的階段，而不再以中政府公署所擬定的紙上計劃為限。這種計劃，已在無數地方實現，還在迅速傳佈着，逐漸克服巳往經濟守舊力的抵抗。</p>

<h3 id="c92">新生女子工藝社展賣  新夢　　三日起雜該會會所展賣四天　各大公司廠商均予合作便利　　中華基督教阜寧春節制協會，是一個國際性的婦女團體，國王對於各種有關婦女的工作，曾有過相當的成績。戰前，婦女界現今劉王立明是該會的中堅，戰後會所由閱明園路遷移到靜安寺路斜橋弄八十號，爲了劉湛恩博士的被人狙擊，劉王立明便遠去香港，但婦女節制協會對於各部門工作，並不因而少懈，相反的正在更積極的推進。　　目前婦女節制協會除了開辦新生女子高級職業學校及中學和補習班等外，特別渴使我們指出的，是新生女子工藝社。這個工藝社是專爲逃難的女子而開辦的，室家雖不很久，成績可已不差。主要的目標，就是訓練逃難女子，使她們對於手工藝都有一技之長，這樣可以自給自食，不必長期的仰人救濟。在一個很短的時間之中，幾百個逃難的婦女受到該社的訓練而得由一技之長，目前能靠手工業生活了。造福難胞，的確不淺哩！　　這一次的戰爭，使女同胞們流離失所，在「孤島」巷也找不到工作，困苦不堪的，不知有多少，所以婦女節制協會的卡板新生女子工藝班，和商界合作，使一般逃難婦女，都有工可作，能夠生活，是一件迫切的事情，也是婦女團體所愿得舉辦的。最近更決定於十一月三·四·五·六於斜橋弄八十號會所舉行出品展賣四天，目的是在喚起社會人士的同情和注意，能夠踴躍的購買該社出品，使幾百難女，生活方面不發生問題。　　記得新生女子工藝社去年也曾舉行過一次展賣，而不久之前，難民生產消費合作社門市部在辣斐德路八百五十號開幕時，新生女子工藝社也有出品參加。一般的說來，該社的出品，不但和各工廠所製者，相形之下，也比普通的公司商號要便宜。　　這一次的展覽，出品方面，大部份是難女們的手工藝出品，包括童裝，繡物，絨線織物，紙花，玩具，服裝，　毯，椅墊等，門類是相當的多。總括的說一句，全是兒童用品，和家用雜物。除了展賣之外，婦女節制協會更在極力向外界推銷代價券。南京路的四大公司，國貨公司，以及中國化學社，已都允加以贊助，實行合作。雖然展賣的日期，祗有四天，但閉幕之後，還是將陳列在斜橋路八十號，長期出賣。希望社會人士，對於一群女難胞能夠予以莫大的同情，而踴躍的購買該社出品，那麼也是一件莫大的善事哩！不准結婚　　此次郵局招考初級郵務員的時候，據稱奉郵政總局之令，報名考試者以男性爲限，即局內女性郵務佐，亦不得殘疾。其理由是女性體力脆弱，不便調遣，可是這「體恤」並沒有得到婦女界的同意，相反的，她們更舉出相當的反證——「上次招考錄取人員中，女性應調就道赴西南服務者，與錄取名額作比例，其成數反較男性爲高。」（見上海婦女界告全國女書）可見不收女性的真實理由並不在此，而真實的理由呢，歐美至今沒有看到；看到的是史訂定限制錄川女性職員辦法四項。從著四項辦法的三四兩項，已嫁女性不得報考及其入局後結婚者，則於將屆結婚時，予以裁退上看來，即至少可以讓我媽猜測道若干理由，十不准結婚。　　記得我們的「幽默家」是說過遮眼法的一句名言：「女子最好的職業是結婚。」現在郵局的辦法，卻一恰是這幽默名言的詮釋。在目前，我們果然不能否認，還是若干女性祗知以來漲幅度着安閑的生活，但是把目光放得遠一點，在中國的任何一個角落裹，中國的女性都已堅強地站立起來，參加者任何活動與工作。如果說那位「幽默家」的話是在諷刺某一部份女性，那末郵局的不准結婚論又是一個太老實的讀者了。　　自然，這是私人的猜測之辭，在全國一致的抗戰時期，即使對於那些落後的女性，我們也不能以幽默的諷刺，而使他們永久沉落下去、我們應該使她們省悟，驚覺，婦女界告全國婦女書中說得很明白：「今年來，抗戰軍興，國家處於千鈞一髮之際，致勝之道，亦惟集全國國民之力，爲國川而已，我最高領袖諄諄以動員全國一切人力物力，爭取最後勝利告誡國民。婦女同屬國民，責任所在，理當竭盡所能貢獻國家，不容放棄天職。」所以我們希望對於不收女性，及訂定的四項限制錄用女性職員辦法，有充分的理由，加以說明，或立即收回成命。　（冬耳）雨過天青　包天笑第十七回　習外勤報人新領域　服內務學舍小排塲　　當有人初次把邵慧華小姐推薦個那家報館裹的時候，他們　得一位年輕小姐去當外勤　者，都是有許多女性們在那裹服務。姑且試試看，先派了她幾回輕鬆的訪問的事，關於女界的多，可是她都能勝任愉快。後來慢慢的比較艱巨的事，也派到了她了，編輯部裹諸位先生，都很滿意她。要知道探訪新聞這件事，誒有固定的，全靠自己頭腦的靈敏。古人說得的「能與人規矩，不能與人巧，」凡百學問，都是如此。就像新聞學上引你一條大道，但大道走不通，即便如何？難道不能尋出一條別路來嗎？試想以世界之大，空間時間，漫天匣地，都是新聞，只要你自己去尋。善於覓新聞者，他只要在空氣里一嗅，便知道那裹又新聞，這個名爲「新聞鼻」。有新聞鼻的人，他一嗅便知道新聞在那裹。沒有新聞鼻的人，縱有很好的新聞，在空氣之中，他也一些嗅不出來。像燒慧華小姐，她是生就是有新聞鼻的人。非但如此，而且當新聞記者的人，第一要自己的有興味。有了興味，便什麽都不管了，冒險精神也有了，耐苦意志也有了。有比了當新聞記者更優厚，更舒服的事，教他去幹，他情願放棄了不去，而甘心做那艱苦的工作。這趨勢爲何呢？就會他有那興味，佔據了他的忠心咧。雖然是一位新聞記者，第一是要有天才，第二是要有修養，第三就是說要有興味，這三者幾乎缺一不可。先以天才而論，就是我上面所說有新聞鼻的人，多少對於新聞事業是有天才的。不然，一樣的發生了一件事，同樣的人來們的感覺，爲什麽人家木木然不感受到什麽，而又新聞天才的人，卻就嗅到裏面有新聞的氣息呢？便是同樣去訪問一位要人，一樣聽到這位要人的一場談話，爲什麽人家往往聽不出他話中有話，以外有意，而一經這位天才的新聞家聽了，就覺得心領神會，曲解旁通，可以抉發他的不宣之秘呢？　（一九七）生活報告浸蝕在銅灰中的一羣  苻萑　　——鑤銅作工人的話——　　在秋夜蕭疎的月光下。我跟鑤銅作的學徒談著他的身世和生活。我盯著他泛著苦笑的蒼白的臉龐，我不願嗅一下夜風里飄來的良鄉（？）栗子的香氣，但我卻並不忽略從他那篇灰白的嘴唇中吐出來的，每一個顫抖和沉沉重的字…　　你問我幾歲進這裡的嘛？咳！說你聽也許不相信；在七歲那年道此作學徒的，如今我已經十八歲了，在這裡工作了已有足足十年光景，但我還沒升爲司務，而依舊是個學徒。　　在這裡的學徒，除了我之外，都是訂好合同的，五年六年都有，因爲他們是由爹媽送進這裡來學習的；然而我卻是我老闆化了錢買來的。所以我不知道幾時才可以跳出這「學徒」的枷鎖？！　　起初幾年，我做的事當然是打雜，揩刷銅器和一些零碎簡便的事務，那時到還好，因爲擦刷銅器是不再客堂（機器間）里做的，而在後天井或是門口外的，所以我的身體比現在要強壯得多多。大約在十歲以後，我開始做鑤銅的工作了，每天我捧著霉黑的銅器在機器上鑤擦，讓銅灰進我的鼻管，嘴喉，眼睛……銅灰把我的精血吮吸了去，我便一天一天的消瘦下去了。——一說到這裡，他的聲音有些更嚴了。他向我瞥了眼，袒開胸膛，那瘦黃乾癟的胸口，廿四支肋骨幾乎根根都數得清的。　　我們現在每一天的實足要做十六個鐘點的工作，除了吃飯，睡覺之外，其餘的時間便一直忙著製造銅灰來消蝕自己的身子。我們的工作雖然是夠苦的，但我們的待遇確實菲薄得可憐；這里的工鈿最大的是老發，的確，老發作一些工作實在是道地的，又靈又快，然而他每月卻祗有十隻老洋的工鈿。我現在也算加到三元一月了，第一年近來的時候我是挨不資格拿工鈿的，祗有二毛小洋的津貼，剃頭，惚浴，零用……都在這二毛上面，但現在我總算也有三元了！　　他抬頭望著蒙上黑紗的月亮，夜沉了，二貓星想著斜西的月芽　閃著眼；街頭已靜寂得像死了一般。他告別了我，打著呵欠，搖擺著疲乏的身子，拐進了門檻。 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>

<p>游藝界活躍中的昆明游藝界  淮生　　昆明因地當滇緬滇越兩大國際路綫交點，成為西南後方交通孔道，地位生要，僅次於行都的重慶。所以人口遞增，市塵繁榮，游藝事業，也跟着有了空前的發展。　　電影　　昆明現有電影院兩家，一名大衆一名逸樂。大衆內容華貴，燈彩輝煌，設備齊整，座價亦昂至一元以上。映片都為舶來品；好萊塢和蘇聯的出品都有。逸樂雖說比較普通一點，座價也在一元左右。映片則以國產為主，像花木蘭貂蟬等片，在這裏都有過良好收穫。　　戲院　　戲院也只兩家，一是新滇舞台，在湖廣會館舊址，專演滇劇，觀衆也十九為本地人，設備簡陋，座價也較便宜，在五六角之間。這種地方戲，大致都從平劇中蛻化出來，所以聲調作派，劇本情節，也都和平劇大同小異，並且也有男女合演的。一是新生舞台，在金碧公園內，設備較之新滇略為講究，座價則在一元以上。戲院沒有一個固定的基本戲班，此去彼來，都是屬之於流動性質的。趙如泉和黃玉麟，都來這裏搭過班，成績都還不壞，尤其是趙如泉，昆明人對之印象極好。　　話劇　　昆明劇運，極為發達，新興劇團，如雨後春筍，有十餘個之多。就性質分，屬之於學生界的，有雲大，同濟，聯大和航校的大鵬劇社；靑年界的有靑年會劇團；兒童界的有兒童劇團；小學敎師和共他職業界的有業餘劇社。二年來演出的劇本很多，現成的有日出，雷雨等，新編的有黃浦月，飛將軍等，不下七八十種。而最近國防劇社假座新滇，由曹禺先生親自導演，演出他三大名作之一的原野，舞台監督是孫毓棠，設計是聞一多和雷圭元，都是戲界有名鉅子。演員陣容嶄齊，佈景尤為富麗，所以戲報貼出，雖座價高至二元以上，預定座位的還是爭先恐後，紛至沓來，票資收入，達一萬餘元，允其可稱為昆明戲界的盛事　　歌詠和舞蹈　　武漢合唱團和陳大悲君領導的敎部戲劇組歌詠班，先後來這裏播下過唱歌的種子，所以現在昆明街頭，甚至四郊角落，都可以聽到悲壯慷慨的歌聲。此外在道裏訓練的苗徭各族壯丁，舞蹈就是他們拿手傑作，每開慰勞祝捷大會，都有他們的舞蹈表演。有時列隊出發火炬遊行，載歌載舞，如火如荼，情况尤為熱烈。　　總：昆明游藝界的各部門，氣象萬千，都在活躍的氣氛中滋長着。賽金花之廬山眞面目  浣蘭　　璇宮劇院前曾公演賽金花，盛極一時。按賽金花原名趙靈飛，蘇州人，生於同治十年，申報創刊時，她正是一歲。伊一生事蹟，變化多端，誠可歌可泣。幼即淪入靑樓，及壯一躍而為使節夫人，此後重入勾欄，又作馮婦，並一再適人，晚年則流離顚沛，病死破屋中。楊雲史氏在其墓上，略記其一生事蹟，尤於聯軍入京時賽氏之活動，言之極詳。其詞曰：「初聯軍以拳匪殺德使臣克林德，故各國舉德為聯軍首，而以瓦德西為八國統帥。德以修怨故，蹂躪居民，淫掠殊撍紳閨閣，爭投井懸楔自殺以殉難，嗣由禮部奏旌節烈者四百餘擋。靈飛旣與瓦暱，數乘間言於瓦，使的東所部，嚴禁淫戮，開釋株連，以蘇民困，瓦皆立行。」當時瓦德四居儀鸞殿，賽金花出入不禁。梁啟超亦有詩咏其事：「聯歡必竟賴此花，售意輸情本慣家，銀總擁出儀鸞殿，爭認娉婷賽二爺。」足見賽氏當年曾拯民於水火，不能以普通平康中人目之。惟時代不同，若依今口之情勢，則賽氏之觍顏事仇，實為民族之罪人！附照為其年靑時之影，所著衣飾，在今人視之，並不美觀，但當時實為最時髦之服裝也。樂園外紀  　　殺子報與殺父奇案　　我們再把道兩案的帮兇，及吿發人來研究一下，則「殺子報」中之徐氏，係逼令其女助已行此慘無人道之事，姊見弟被殺，驚惶失措，悲痛莫可名狀，手捧愛弟一手一足，猶以手撫摩，哭泣不止，迨其母大呵一聲，始拋　罐中一段，况其母雖以一時淫慾衝動。舉刀殺死其子，然而旣殺之後，未始不有後悔之意，故喘息一旁，目不忍視，但命其女將屍體裝起。惟周永杰被其二子謀斃事，則與此頗有不同，兄弟事前同謀，只可謂為難兄難弟，並無首從之分一也。事後均無悲痛懺悔之意，且態度安閑，髣髴醫學家之解剖實騐二也。刀斬只要把眼睛一閉，牙關咬緊，尙易下此毒手，鋸解須眼睜睜的瞧着徐徐下手，對於一隻鷄犬，尙且心中不忍，何况以這種手段對付直系奪親？欽吉欽祥兩人的心地毒辣，也就可見一般。此種人要呌他們立身社會，將來的禍患寗堪設想，此其三也。　　其次再把此兩案的吿發人叙述一下，官保死後是他的塾師王先生代他當堂聲寃的。從前師道尊嚴，所以常有師徒如父子這麼一說，封建時代往往父親把兒子送到當官，則先生可以把他領出，反之學生要是犯了學規，先生責之不足，甚至將他送到官府，那末，學生的父親是領不出來的，官保的父親死了，小孩子就依先生如嚴父一般，先生見他次日不來上學，再與昨日保官最後作別的話一對照，這才仗義代他伸寃，捉獲惡僧淫婦，雪了徒兒的奇寃。（一三〇）你要知道的　大華大戲院的種種  孟和　　關於大華大戲院的情報，本刋已有多次的報道。最近從有關係方面，聽到種種消息，有許多是外界所不知道的，似乎有述說的必要，現在不厭求詳，分述如次：　　開幕日期　這是絕大的一個謎，也是外界人士念待「分解」的，在事實上，最不能確定的是開幕日期，因為建築工程，日夜的趕築，難保不有障礙發生。當局的最後決定，大約十一月二十日左右，準可與全滬仕女行相見禮。聽說獻映的前一天，預備柬邀有關侮方面，作一次參觀的巡禮。　　選映影片　影片選映米高梅公司，是大衆曉喻的事實。該昆蟲上銀幕  劬　　世界上無論什麼東西，祇要用功夫，沒有不可應用的。現在來報吿一點新希消息吧。握電影業牛耳的好萊塢，各色演員，無不羅致，影星除人外，再有獸類影星，照樣也有豐厚的薪金。現在更奇了！昆蟲也能上銀幕。原來是這樣的：好萊塢演員中有名富格耳Syd　Fogel者，他能別出心裁，訓練蠅，蜘蛛，甲蟲和一切蝨類為電影中的演員。一滴糖漿可以使他的演昌們聚在一起，用一些食物的薄弱痕跡，可以引誘牠們走跑或飛到一個目的地。富格耳對於各種昆蟲的習性，曾經研究得非常熟悉，支配牠們在銀幕上擔任適當的角色。這種當演員昆蟲，是放在細髪編成的帶上，在攝影以前，需先把牠們收藏起來。當格耳訓練的昆蟲需要極繁所以他的工作也是忙得不可開交公司事前巳有充分的準備，存有二十幾部的初映巨片。像歌后麥唐納的「情天歌侶一，韋斯穆勒的「泰山得子」，勞勃杜奈的「萬世師表」，瓊克勞馥，「米樹銀花」，瑙瑪希拉的「女人」，米蓋縱納的第一張鉅片「金玉滿堂」，都已經在上海試映過。就是價値四百萬金的五彩童話鉅片“Wizard　ofoz”也運抵本埠，將來要宣傳一番，動員全滬的影迷哩。其他種種全院最特色的是：穿堂之內，再有一座休息室，彷彿像套房一樣，別有洞天。太平門的衆多，給予座客以不少的便利。全院色調的諧和，充滿著一股熱的情調。冷氣與熱氣的設備，不必說是本年度最新式的機械。最偉大的設備是空氣調節，能在二分鐘的極短時間中，把一座偌大戲院的惡濁空氣，完全抽洩凈盡，另外輸送全部淸新空氣，使座衆的身心，獲得相當的裨益。　　現在所能報告的，盡在於此，以後續訊，常儘速的報吿讀者。</p>

<p>Xiushui: Yesterday morning, the Chinese army attacked Wuning. The Japanese fiercely resisted, but the Chinese army launched a fierce assault, repeatedly charging and killing, once reaching the north gate of the city. They engaged in intense combat with the Japanese for a long time, killing countless enemies. Later, a large Japanese force from the suburbs reinforced them. The Chinese army fought again for about an hour before safely withdrawing. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Miluo: The Chinese army's vanguard has swiftly penetrated deep into the Japanese lines and is extremely active. One day, near Tan Jia (south of Yanglousi) in Linxiang East, they encountered the Japanese and engaged in fierce fighting, annihilating many enemies. The remaining Japanese forces collapsed and fled north, and the Chinese army immediately occupied Tan Jia. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Chinese Army spokesman stated today during the weekly review of the war situation that the Japanese army on the north bank of the Yangtze River, west of Hankou, is conducting frequent operations. It is reported that some of the Japanese troops participating in the military operations on the northern Hunan front have recently been transferred from the south bank of the Yangtze River to the opposite bank, west of Hankou. The Japanese troops stationed in northern Jiangxi are said to have been transferred upstream to Hankou. However, the spokesman did not specify whether they believe these actions are related to a possible immediate Japanese invasion along the Yangtze River or are merely troop transfers. The spokesman added that the Chinese and Japanese armies in various sectors of northern Hunan are confronting each other across the Xinqiang River. A Chinese army unit has crossed the river south of Yuezhou, and Chinese artillery is shelling Tongcheng on the northeast Changsha highway. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to a Chinese military spokesman today, the fighting in southern Shanxi has been extremely fierce in the past week. Both routes of Japanese troops were routed by the Chinese army's flanking maneuvers. The Japanese army first used Bo'ai as a starting point, then divided into two routes: one advancing towards Beizhuang and the other towards Baoma Men (transliteration) in the northeast. However, after the Chinese army launched a flanking maneuver, these two routes of Japanese troops retreated. Meanwhile, the Japanese army based in Linfen is currently conducting large-scale military operations west of the Tongpu Railway, hoping to clear out Chinese guerrillas in the area in order to cross the river and enter Shaanxi. (31st AP Dispatch)</p>
<p>A Certain Place in Shandong: After the Chinese army recovered Lucun, the remaining Japanese troops fled in disarray and have been sweeping the area near the village for days, killing many Japanese. Furthermore, 300-400 Japanese soldiers advanced near Nanma, but were surrounded and attacked by the Chinese army, annihilating over half of them. The remaining Japanese broke through and fled. There are no traces of the Japanese in Lucun, Nanma, Zhangzhuang, Shiqiao, Jiushan, and other places. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tunxi: The Japanese troops who invaded Hugexi, Dong'anzhen, Longchang, and other places on the 26th were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army. The Japanese abandoned over a hundred corpses and retreated. Subsequently, the Japanese reinforced with over 700 troops and counterattacked. The Chinese army calmly responded, and the Japanese repeatedly launched fierce attacks, but all failed. A portion of the Japanese troops infiltrated Xia Zhuang, attempting to threaten the Chinese rear, but were again bravely repelled by the Chinese. As of the evening of the 28th, fierce fighting was still ongoing in the vicinity of Zhangzhuang. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji: The Japanese near Daning divided into three groups to invade. The southern route reached the Shangtiao Village, Xiage Village, Ling'ershang area, and was defeated by the Chinese. A portion of the northern route Japanese troops attempted to invade Yonghe. The western route Japanese troops engaged with a Chinese unit in the Ge Shang (west of Daning) southwest area starting at 9:00 AM on the 30th, and remained in a standoff until evening.

<p>Chongqing: The recent great victory in Northern Hunan has filled the nation with joy, and congratulations have been telegraphed from all sides. Now, Xinjiang Governor Sheng Shicai and Chairman Li Rong have jointly sent a telegram of congratulations. The original text is as follows: "Having omitted some honorifics" The War of Resistance has been ongoing for over two years. The loyal and brave soldiers at the front, under the resolute leadership of our Supreme Commander Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, have fought bravely against the enemy, repeatedly thwarting their plots. The victories in Taierzhuang, Pingxingguan, and the major battles in northern Hubei have spread far and wide, enough to make the stubborn enemy tremble with fear. However, the invaders' ambition has not died. In this battle of Northern Hunan, they mobilized 100,000 troops to attack us, attempting to capture Changsha in one fell swoop. Fortunately, our two commanders directed the battle effectively, and the troops on all fronts rushed to fight bravely, ultimately achieving a surprising victory, annihilating tens of thousands of Japanese troops. This unprecedented great victory is a prelude to the renaissance of the Chinese nation. When the news of the victory arrived, the masses rejoiced. Shicai and others are far away in the border regions, and for the sake of striving for the final victory, we can only work hard to consolidate the rear areas of the War of Resistance, and call on the people of Xinjiang to contribute all their resources and financial strength to support the front, in order to complete the great cause of the War of Resistance and national construction as soon as possible. I respectfully submit this humble offering and await your wise instructions. Sheng Shicai, Li Rong, respectfully kowtow. Official seal. (31st Dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing: According to official sources here today, the highways in various provinces of northwestern China were mostly built with the assistance of the Ma family's Muslim troops. In addition, the highways from Sichuan to Xinjiang also benefited greatly from the Muslim troops. Besides road construction, the Muslim troops have also participated in the War of Resistance against Japan. It is reported that there are often 20,000 of the Ma family's Muslim troops engaged in road construction. As for the highway between Gansu and Xinjiang, namely the highway directly from Gansu to the Soviet border, it was built by mobilizing 120,000 men and women by the Ma family. The entire line is 1,172 kilometers long, with 100 bridges totaling 1,940 meters in length. The road is 10 meters wide, and the places it passes through are the ancient Silk Road, with forests planted on both sides, which is truly a spectacular sight. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek was extremely pleased to hear of the completion of this road and specially allocated 100,000 yuan to commend and reward the Muslim troops. (31st AP Dispatch)</p>

<p>Wuyuan: The Ulanqab, Urat, and the two Rear Middle Banners have been oppressed by the Japanese puppets for a long time. Since the Sui Provincial Government actively promoted Mongolian affairs, these banners have successively sent representatives to the west to surrender, expressing their support for the central government and reporting that their banners have been oppressed by the Japanese puppets, who have conscripted strong men, forcibly allocated camels, cattle, horses, sheep, and livestock in large numbers, causing resentment among the Mongolians.

<p>(Report from this city this morning) At approximately 0040 hours this morning, traffic was suddenly cut off on Yidingpan Road, Daxilu Road, Columbia Road and surrounding areas, which are roads built by the Shanghai Municipal Council outside the Settlement. Nearby residents heard a burst of gunshots, as thick as rapid-fire machine guns. Vehicles travelling between the Settlement and the above-mentioned roads were also stopped. The situation was quite serious. It was later learned that the incident occurred when a Settlement patrol car passed Anhe Temple Road, and a puppet police officer obstructed it and opened fire. The police officer in the patrol car disarmed the puppet policeman. Subsequently, Settlement police vehicles arrived, and the situation began to ease and order was restored.</p>

<p>Tokyo: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a meeting at 6:30 PM yesterday to discuss diplomatic policies to deal with the China Incident. Foreign Minister Nomura, Vice Ministers Tada and Tani Masayuki, and the directors of various bureaus attended. The meeting adjourned at 0:00 this morning. The matters discussed at the meeting were how Japan should conduct diplomacy with Britain and the United States based on the upcoming establishment of a "central government" in China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to hold continuous meetings in the coming days to continue negotiations. The adjustment of relations with Britain and the United States will focus on the China Incident and will be conducted with particular caution. Among them, the Tianjin issue will be resolved first in relations with Britain, and communication between the two countries will be facilitated in relations with the United States in order to discover clues to resolve the outstanding issues between the two countries. Foreign Minister Nomura, because of the need to first listen to the other party's opinions, plans to meet with the US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, in the coming days to exchange views. (31st Domei Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: This morning, Foreign Minister Nomura, Vice Minister Tani Masayuki, and senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs met to discuss the specific procedures for the "new central government" in China. It is expected that the China Affairs Bureau will hold a meeting tomorrow to discuss in detail the handling of Chinese affairs, and the interests of the third-party powers in China in response to the emergence of the "new central government" in China. It is heard that Prime Minister Abe, Foreign Minister Nomura, Army Minister Hata Shunroku, Navy Minister Yoshida, Finance Minister Aoki, and other senior officials will attend the meeting. Today, the Nichi Nichi Shimbun published an article commenting on the issue, saying that Japan is now gradually approaching the goal of resolving Chinese affairs, and will soon use the construction of a new "central government" in China as its marker. At the same time, it will adjust Japan's relations with the third-party powers. Although a formal agreement has not yet been officially reached, it seems that Foreign Minister Nomura will meet with US Ambassador to Japan Grew in the coming days to exchange views on the situation between Japan and the United States. The Asahi Shimbun believes that when Foreign Minister Nomura meets with US Ambassador Grew, he will likely ask for recognition of the large-scale military operations that Japan is currently conducting in China, just as former Foreign Minister Arita did near the time of the Anglo-Japanese conference, when he asked the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Craigie, to express his consent. Nomura will likely ask Grew to recognize Japan's sincerity and efforts in respecting American rights and interests in China, and will also ask the ambassador to note Japan's determination to build a new order in East Asia, which cannot be shaken by opposition or interference from any party, even if the United States imposes economic pressure on Japan after abolishing the 1911 US-Japan Commercial and Navigation Treaty, followed by a ban on arms shipments to Japan, or uses other means. There are currently as many as 600 outstanding issues between the United States and Japan. After Nomura agrees on the general principles with the ambassador, they will be transferred to the local area for resolution. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e20">Hesitant Japan <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of last month, Japanese Prime Minister Abe and Foreign Minister Nomura, at a meeting of local governors, declared their diplomatic policy: towards the United States, they said they would "continue to work hard so that the United States can fully understand Japan's true intentions." At the end of last week, a Tokyo dispatch stated that Japan planned to hold trial negotiations with the United States this week; therefore, whether US-Japan relations improve or deteriorate will be decided within this week. As of the night before last, a Tokyo dispatch from the Japanese Domei News Agency stated that the issues to be discussed in the US-Japan talks included (1) general interests in China (i.e., the Nine-Power Treaty's principles of open door, equal opportunity, opening of concessions, and navigation on the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers), (2) US-Japan trade issues, and (3) Pacific peace guarantees. It also stated that the Japanese government believes that making Britain and the United States aware of the new order is a shortcut to resolving the situation, so the Japanese government will fully exchange views with relevant parties and first conduct this work with Britain and the United States. Another dispatch from Domei stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs authorities continued the morning's talks at 6:30 p.m. on the 30th, reopening the summit at the Foreign Minister's official residence, chaired by Foreign Minister Nomura, to continue discussions on the steps and policies Japan should take in dealing with negotiations with Britain, Japan, and the United States. All the above descriptions are based on official or semi-official Japanese sources: Japan's current "concerns" can be said to be clearly expressed in its words.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, Suma, suddenly completely denied what was reported in yesterday's newspaper; a summary of its main points is as follows:</p>
<p>"The Japanese government has no intention of starting formal or informal talks with Britain and the United States at present to resolve various outstanding issues, nor has it ever made such an attempt. He intends to dispel the impression created by various Japanese newspapers that US-Japan and British-Japan talks will be held soon. British Ambassador Craigie has met with Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tani Masayuki, but part of this conversation was routine and unrelated to the rumored negotiations between Japan and Britain and the United States. Foreign Minister Nomura may meet with US Ambassador Grew soon to discuss routine matters, but the purpose of this meeting is also not to start formal negotiations between the United States and Japan. The news that the Pearl River and the Yangtze River will be opened soon for foreign shipping is just speculation. The Japanese government authorities, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, are not currently considering such matters. It is expected that China's new 'regime' will be established within a month. The establishment of China's 'new central government' will clarify the situation in the Far East. Japan's decided policy is to assist China's 'new central government' in its steady development."</p>
<p>"Foreign Affairs" "spokesman" is a qualified liar; helplessly, he blames the newspapers, saying that there are no other unspeakable secrets? Speculating on this: either because the expectation of negotiations with Britain and the United States failed in its exploratory phase, so it denies it; or because there is no certainty of success in the negotiations, so it engages in secret contact, reserving room for maneuver after failure; or because internal Japanese opinions are divided and contradictory on issues such as opening up navigation, unable to unify, unable to negotiate with Britain and the United States, and therefore has to avoid consideration; or because it focuses all its hopes on the dream of a "political offensive," thinking that it can also extricate itself from the quagmire and hopes to clarify the Far East. All the above speculations cannot be asserted as inevitable, but there are clues to be found, and it is believable that they are not far from the truth. Although I think what he said is due to unspeakable secrets, what Japan is most anxious about is to attempt to melt Britain and the United States and hope to start negotiations, which is definitely not something that a qualified lie can achieve and I think. Therefore, I believe that pursuing the opportunity to start talks is one thing, and immediately conducting negotiations is another. We cannot regard the denial as meaning that there will be no more negotiations; it should be known that Abe's rise to power and Nomura's taking office are actually the prelude to their ideal of finding a diplomatic path to open up Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>From our observation, Japan knows that it is trapped in a quagmire, so it is eager to extricate itself; what a pity that it lacks the courage of a strong man to cut off his wrist and the wisdom to change its course; the sun is setting, and the road is long, with no way out. To analyze it: it initially wished to use a military offensive, regardless of everything, to solve everything, but by the third year, the military offensive had reached the end of its strength; then it planned to use a political offensive, regardless of everything, to create all the established facts, but unexpectedly it could not get its way internally, and there was heavy pressure from abroad that it could not ignore; therefore, in order to complete the partial success of its aggression, it had to seek a combination of diplomatic and political offensives. What Suma called "the establishment of a new central government in China will clarify the situation in the Far East," and the Domei News Agency's statement that "the Japanese government believes that making Britain and the United States aware of the new order is a shortcut to resolving the situation" are confessions of expecting cooperation. Britain and the United States have their own policies, and the United States' policy is firm and cannot be shaken by Japan's diplomatic strategies and tactics; Japan does not reflect on itself but begs for diplomatic solutions, only to see its efforts become increasingly fruitless and will eventually achieve nothing, which we have repeatedly said; however, if the rumored negotiations between the United States and Japan do begin, then Japan will have an opportunity to be instructed by the United States. We hope that the United States will patiently guide Japan, and Japan may therefore regain its reason, which would not be in vain for the United States. If Japan insists on seeing this as a diplomatic offensive, then Japan will definitely receive a more practical lesson after the negotiations: and the negotiations will also be another stage in Japan's sunset and gradual decline.</p>
<p>The Japanese are not necessarily lacking in reason, but they are blinded by greed, resulting in incoherence. Try to prove this with their political tactics; an Associated Press Tokyo dispatch on the day stated that "a spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared here today that a new central government to rule the Japanese-occupied areas will be established within a month." A Reuters Tokyo dispatch on the same day stated that Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Suma said that "the establishment of a new central government will clarify the situation in the Far East." How can the consciousness between occupied areas and new central government be contradictory and incomprehensible? Even if only charged with ruling the occupied areas, and again expected to clarify the Far East, in terms of name and reality, the space is not suitable, and the distance is ten thousand miles, how can this consciousness be incomprehensible again? Honoring the organization of the occupied area as a new central government, honoring the functions of the new central government as rule: and again, independence, equality, sovereignty, and various terms practically used for countries and internationally, are all used appropriately; we have all heard these words; but why are they so eager to negotiate with Britain and the United States in Tokyo, to seek solutions to rights issues and open door issues? How can they be so fragmented and disjointed? They want to swallow it, but they can't bear to swallow it. They want to not swallow it, but they want to try to swallow it. This kind of患得患失 demeanor cannot be concealed. If they say they no longer want it, no longer want to swallow it, then there is no evidence to date.</p>

<p>Rome: The cabinet was reshuffled this morning. Except for the various ministries concurrently held by Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano, the ministers of all other ministries have been changed. The Minister of the Army and Chief of Staff and the Secretary-General of the Fascist Party have also been replaced. Previously, Minister of Professional Associations Landini, Minister of Culture and Propaganda Alfieri, Minister of Exchange and Monetary Affairs Gaineri, Minister of Agriculture Rossoni, Minister of Transportation Pelegi, Minister of Public Works Gigliani, Vice Minister of the Army and Chief of Army Staff General Baljani, Vice Minister of Aviation and Chief of Air Force Staff General Vale, and Secretary to the Prime Minister's Office Vassalo jointly submitted their resignations to Prime Minister Mussolini this morning. The Prime Minister immediately accepted them and decided on the candidates for the new cabinet as follows: Prime Minister concurrently Minister of the Army, Navy, and Air Force: Mussolini</p>
<p>Foreign Minister: Ciano (unchanged)</p>
<p>Minister of Colonies (originally held concurrently by the Prime Minister): General Da Lucci (formerly Vice Minister of Colonies)</p>
<p>Minister of Professional Associations: Licci (formerly Vice Minister)</p>
<p>Minister of Culture and Propaganda: Pavolini (new appointment)</p>
<p>Minister of Exchange and Monetary Affairs: Ricciardi (new appointment)</p>
<p>Minister of Agriculture: Tassinari (new appointment)</p>
<p>Minister of Transportation: Fantuli (new appointment)</p>
<p>Minister of Public Works: Serrena (new appointment)</p>
<p>Vice Minister of the Army: General Soddu (new appointment)</p>
<p>Chief of Army Staff: General Graziani (former Governor of Abyssinia)</p>
<p>Vice Minister of Aviation and Chief of Air Force Staff: General Prigo (new appointment)</p>
<p>Secretary to the Prime Minister's Office: General Russo (new appointment)</p>
<p>In addition, a new position was established, specializing in the reconstruction of cities in marshlands, with Mengini as the director. In addition, Secretary-General of the Fascist Party Starace, who has held the position for eight years, has been transferred to the position of Chief of Staff of the Fascist Party Army, and his vacancy will be filled by Party Elder Muti. This person served as an air force pilot during the war between Italy and Abyssinia, achieving outstanding merit, and also played an important role in the Battle of Anibaraya in the Spanish Civil War, after which he served as the Director-General of Overseas Party Affairs of the Fascist Party until now. In addition, Minister of Culture and Propaganda Arofilly has been appointed as an ambassador by Prime Minister Mussolini, but has not yet been assigned a substantive position. Observers have commented on the cabinet reshuffle, saying that former Chief of Army Staff General Baljani, Minister of Culture and Propaganda Alfieri, and Secretary-General of the Fascist Party Starace are all known for being pro-German, and their departure from office is noteworthy (Havas, 31st).</p>
<p>Paris: The Italian cabinet reshuffle has been commented on by political figures here, who said that Italy attaches great importance to strictly maintaining political independence in the current European situation, especially with regard to Germany, which can be clearly demonstrated. The country's Prime Minister Mussolini has thoroughly reshaped the cabinet more than once, but this time the dismissed cabinet members were all in office when the relations between Germany and Italy were the closest. Among them, Minister of Culture and Propaganda Alfieri and Secretary-General of the Fascist Party Starace, who advocated for the close relationship between Germany and Italy, both possessed significant influence among the people in the capacity of "mass guides," and were also known for being pro-German. Therefore, the cabinet change in Italy is of great significance and is valued by the French government (Havas, 31st).</p>

<p>London: Italian Ambassador to Britain Bastianini confirmed yesterday, during the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Fascist entry into Rome, that the Italian Fascist government still holds an anti-Bolshevik attitude. Speaking to 2,000 Italian expatriates, he declared, "Italy, only Italian Fascism has never violated the revolutionary process. The revolutionary movement was born anti-Bolshevik and remains anti-Bolshevik to this day. There has been an antagonistic feeling between Rome and Moscow from the beginning, and that antagonistic feeling continues to this day." After recounting the achievements of the Fascist Party at home and abroad over the past seventeen years, the ambassador declared, "While the great powers participating in the war today hesitate to use their people for tragic and fatal conflicts on a massive scale, Italy has nothing to fear." The ambassador solemnly stated the state of Italy's military preparations, saying, "The Roman government must pay attention to European, especially Mediterranean, issues. The Italian people know that war can still happen even if Italy does not participate. The Italian people know even more that peace cannot be talked about if Italy is not involved in peace negotiations" (AP, 31st).</p>

<p>Stockholm: The "Swedish Daily" recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent, stating that the Soviet Union and Italy are currently engaged in intrigue and struggle, both seeking to expand their influence in the Balkan Peninsula. This matter is attracting great attention in German officialdom. It is reported that the Soviet Union intends to ask Bulgaria to allow it to construct naval and air bases in Black Sea coastal ports. The Bulgarian government is finding it difficult to refuse. Italy, on the other hand, wants to organize a group of neutral countries in the Balkan Peninsula, including Bulgaria and Hungary, and conclude a treaty of non-aggression with them. However, the countries of the Balkan Peninsula are still hesitant and undecided, unwilling to accept restrictions from major powers (Havas, 31st).</p>
<p>Sofia: The new Soviet envoy to Bulgaria, Lavrentiev, arrived here this morning with three secretaries. Bulgarian envoy to the Soviet Union Andonov is currently on leave here and will return to his post as soon as he receives instructions. Regarding the relationship between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria, well-informed sources here recently declared that the Soviet Union intends to expand its influence in the Balkan Peninsula and will, in a short period of time, negotiate a commercial agreement and a navigation and aviation treaty with Bulgaria (Havas, 31st).</p>

<p>Helsinki: Finnish envoy Passikivi, accompanied by Finance Minister Tanner, set off for Moscow again today, carrying a written proposal from the Finnish government. According to well-informed sources, this written proposal states the limits of Finnish concessions, and it would be extremely difficult to exceed these limits. (Haitong, 31st)</p>
<p>Copenhagen: According to a telegram from Helsinki, political figures in Helsinki are currently discussing the possibility of concluding a "regional mutual assistance treaty" between the Soviet Union and Finland. This treaty will stipulate that the Gulf of Finland is a closed waterway, and the two contracting parties will mutually recognize interests in the area based on the principle of equality. (Haitong, 31st)</p>
<p>Helsinki: According to a statement from the Finnish government today, all parties and factions in parliament are in complete agreement on Finland's response to the Soviet Union. It is reported that the Finnish government's response completely rejects the Soviet Union's request to establish naval, air, or land bases on Finnish territory. According to political observers here, even if disputes arise between the Soviet Union and Finland, there is still room for mediation in accordance with the 1932 Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Treaty, and it may not immediately resort to military action.

<h3 id="e26">British Government Publishes White Paper: Exposing the Nazi Party's Atrocities in Germany: Over a Thousand Opposition Members Arrested: Inhumane Living Conditions in Concentration Camps <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>London: The government today released a white paper detailing the Nazi government's mistreatment of Jews and opposition elements, detailing the horrific conditions in German concentration camps. It is said that before and after the outbreak of the war, the German government almost daily promoted Britain's atrocities in South Africa forty years ago. In view of this completely unfounded and shameless propaganda, the British government believes that it is now appropriate to publish some reports on Germany's treatment of its own people. Members of various opposition parties in Germany have recently been arrested on a large scale, no less than one thousand nine hundred and thirty-three people, all of whom have been押入收容所, with barbaric treatment, floggings, and tortures occurring daily. Ordinary people in Germany know that the Nazi movement is taking terrible revenge on opponents. The documents contained in this white paper were originally not intended to be made public. The German government often accuses foreign countries of mistreating German minorities, claiming that there is a "Macedonian situation." However, judging from the documents now published, under the rule of the current German government, the situation of its own people and the treatment of Germans do not remind people of the Macedonian situation, but make people recall the darkest period in human history. British Ambassador Sir Henderson learned in a conversation with Hitler that the German leader was not satisfied with the outcome of the trial of German pastor Niemöller. Hitler said that Niemöller was a traitor, and anyone who expressed sympathy for him should be detained in a concentration camp.</p>
<p>The white paper then contains a statement from a former inmate of the Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar, describing the horrific conditions of the camp. It is said that the camp supervisor, Rödl, told a new batch of prisoners, "Some of you have been in prison before, but the taste you experienced in prison is insignificant compared to the treatment you will receive in this camp. You are now entering hell. If you try to resist the authority of the guards, you will be shot immediately. In this camp, there are only two kinds of punishment, namely flogging and death." In the Buchenwald concentration camp, the daily work is sixteen hours, with no holidays on Sundays. Drinking water is prohibited during work, even in hot weather. A wealthy Jewish businessman, who was once a prisoner, said to people, "The food is not bad, but it is very insufficient. When I was in the camp, Jewish prisoners worked twice as hard as others, but their rations were halved. One type of work, carrying huge stones, is exhausting even for those who are well-nourished. The guards mocked the Jews, saying, 'You are now experiencing the same treatment as your ancestors in Egypt. Pharaoh's treatment of the two was far less than now.'" After the daily work is completed, prisoners stand at attention for several hours. Slight violations of rules during work, such as drinking water, are often punished by flogging. The usual practice is for two guards to take turns administering twenty-five lashes, and the person being flogged often faints. However, the guards told the Jews that the German leader had ordered that Jews could be flogged up to sixty lashes.</p>
<p>Another small businessman, who was arrested without cause on a street in Berlin last June and sent to the camp, also said that the usual punishment was for two guards to stand on either side and whip twenty-five times with a horsewhip. If the prisoner cried out, it would be increased to thirty-five lashes. The guards whipped with all their strength, sometimes raising their whips high to increase the force of the blow. Prisoners were often dragged out without cause and tied by their feet to a footboard, causing them to lie face down on a flat board, with their heads clamped between two horizontal bars, and then flogged. Some prisoners died under the lashes as a result. Those who did not die were kicked back to the shed. Prisoners who went crazy had their heads wrapped in bags to prevent them from screaming. Another type of punishment was to tie the prisoner's arms behind their back and suspend them in the air, three meters above the ground. The camp employed special staff to carry out these punishments, suspending them in the air for ten to twelve hours, which was considered public punishment. As for the crowding of prisoners, it is beyond description. For example, a small shed two hundred feet long and eighty feet wide was forced to house two thousand five hundred prisoners. People die every day in the Buchenwald concentration camp. The families of the deceased only learned of their death when they received a notice to pay three marks to collect the ashes of the corpse. Jews must provide evidence of their ability to leave the country before they can be released. The concentration camp is equipped with a 1,000-watt electric fence to prevent people from escaping. The guards are all under orders that if a prisoner walks towards the gate, they can open fire without warning. The guards often told the Jews that each bullet was worth twelve pence, which was the price of a Jew.</p>
<p>Those arrested get up at dawn and gather in the square where the guillotine and flogging rack are located to distribute coffee. Those who report sick are examined by the supervisor. The supervisor then selects those he deems fit to be flogged and punishes them with flogging. The sick in the labor teams are often taken care of with clubs. Finally, the reporting of sickness by Jews is no longer allowed. Jews can only work or die. On November 11, 1938, British Consul General Garner in Vienna reported on anti-Jewish demonstrations there, saying that when Jewish shops and churches were burned by the crowd, the police were instructed not to interfere. Jews gathered in the streets, subjected to spitting, cursing, and beatings. Those who beat and cursed them prided themselves on being the greatest and most civilized nation in the world. The British Consul General also reported on anti-Catholic demonstrations in Vienna, saying that mobs entered Catholic churches, smashing their doors and windows, and destroying their idols. All religiously valuable antiques and the clothing of Catholic individuals were thrown into the courtyard and set on fire. One priest, who resisted slightly, was severely beaten and almost thrown out of the window, his arm injured by glass shards. The room of one pastor was also broken into, and one priest in the room was thrown out of the window, resulting in both legs being broken. Although the bishop telephoned the police station for help, the police only arrived after a quarter of an hour, and the mob had already dispersed. The police did not arrest anyone. British Consul General Bell in Cologne reported on the anti-Jewish riots on November 14, saying that the riots of November 11 were the result of systematic planning. Middle-class Germans all believed it was wrong, but dared not speak out publicly. One German woman made remarks disapproving of the riots in a streetcar, and was arrested as soon as she got off the bus.</p>
<p>British Consul General Smalbone in Florence described the ordeal of a Jew on December 14, saying that this Jew had participated in the European War and had a legitimate business in Florence. According to him, he was subjected to severe mistreatment before being detained in a concentration camp. The police made him kneel and put his hands behind his back, making him lie face down on the ground until his forehead touched the ground. Police would help Jews who could not do so. They would also force them to run wildly around the house, which the police found amusing. After entering the Buchenwald concentration camp, he was flogged for even minor matters. One Jewish pastor, who refused to sign his name, was flogged. The pastor suffered unbearable pain and finally signed his name in humiliation. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>London: After the British government released the white paper on the German government's mistreatment of its people yesterday, all newspapers extracted and published summaries on the front page, and commented on them. They all said that there is no doubt that the Nazi regime must be overthrown, but the nations of all civilized countries should not hate the entire German nation, because the majority of civilians among them are subjected to the abuse of the country's rulers.

<p>Washington - After the Neutrality Act amendment was passed by the Senate yesterday, the House Rules Committee passed a motion advocating that the amendment be submitted to a joint committee of both houses for review. Republican Congressman Fish requested that the House representatives participating in the joint committee should try to maintain the arms embargo. (Note: The House passed a Neutrality Act amendment in June of this year, retaining the arms embargo clause.) However, the motion was opposed by a majority of the Rules Committee members. The House is scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss the Rules Committee's motion. Opposition party congressmen will propose a separate bill insisting on maintaining the arms embargo, which will surely lead to a debate. Democratic Party leaders held a secret meeting this afternoon to estimate how many votes would be obtained in favor of the amendment. Afterwards, responsible figures from the party said that there were still more than 30 undecided Democratic congressmen, but the government could still obtain a majority in favor of the bill when the House votes tomorrow. The Republican National Committee, which originally advocated extending the congressional session to discuss the amendment at length, now believes that Republican congressmen can vote for or against the amendment as they please, so that Congress can adjourn as soon as possible. This change in the party's attitude is probably due to the influence of public opinion, as the American people now attach the greatest importance to the neutrality issue, followed by various domestic issues. In order to prepare for the 1940 election, the Republican Party prefers to end the neutrality issue as soon as possible, so that it can re-discuss domestic issues and avoid delaying the matter, which would arouse public resentment.

<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull reiterated yesterday that the US government attaches great importance to the "Flint" case. Although Hull did not specify what actions the government would take, it is widely believed that the government will lodge a strong protest with the Soviet Union, questioning the Soviet government's violation of its promises when the United States recognized the Soviet government in 1933. State Department officials expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the Soviet government's handling of the incident. The Soviet government has neither provided the US government with information about the matter, nor allowed the German side to send the ship and its crew to Germany. The actions of the administrative authorities in this decision, and the strong protest lodged with the Soviet government in 1935, questioning the Soviet government's violation of its promises not to interfere in the American system of government when the United States recognized the Soviet government, have attracted special attention from all sectors. (Associated Press, 31st)</p>
<p>Washington - Regarding the case of the American cargo ship "Flint" being detained, the State Department received a telegram from Chargé d'Affaires Kirk in Germany, stating that German Foreign Ministry officials had verbally notified that there was still no news about the ship's whereabouts. Secretary of State Hull also told the press that the State Department was carefully studying various issues raised by the case, especially the issue of ensuring the safety of American ships and crew in the future, but he declined to explain how to guarantee it. In addition, the State Department received a telegram from Minister to Norway Mrs. Harriman, reporting that according to reliable semi-official sources, the "Flint" flew the German flag and arrived at Tromsø Island in Norway at 1:00 PM today, and then continued south at 4:00 PM, but this news has not been confirmed by the Norwegian Foreign Ministry. Also, according to MacDonald, General Manager of the Winchaw Company in Chicago, the "Flint" carried a batch of ventilators manufactured by his company, which were to be transported to Ireland for use in air-raid shelters to circulate air. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - According to a report by Mr. Jieben, a special correspondent for a certain German newspaper, the "Flint" arrived at Tromsø, Norway yesterday. Jieben said that he boarded the "Flint" for inspection at 1:00 PM yesterday. The American crew members are still on board. The ship left here at 4:00 PM yesterday at the request of the German authorities. The crew members of the British ship "Stongan," which the "Flint" previously rescued, were ordered by German sailors to disembark when the ship passed through Tromsø. It is widely believed that the reason why German sailors sailed the ship back to Tromsø was to abandon the American crew members there, so that they could freely dispose of the ship.

<p>— Uncle Di</p>
<p>Special Correspondent in London</p>
<p>(6) Index of Attitudes of Participating Countries in the Midst of Chaos</p>
<p>After the last European War, the countries of the world learned various lessons; and in the diplomatic sphere, the biggest were two points: one was opposing pre-war secret diplomacy, and the other was opposing countries concluding alliances separately, forming mutual confrontations. The League of Nations, which was produced after the war, included the remaining missions of eliminating these two points in its tasks. The latter point was completely abolished because of the collusion of the German-Japanese-Italian group; they also all withdrew from the League of Nations. As for the former point, before the British Foreign Secretary Eden resigned last spring, diplomacy among the remaining countries, except for the group of invaders, could more or less follow the path of the League of Nations and proceed with a dignified posture. However, as soon as Eden resigned, British Prime Minister Chamberlain pursued secret diplomacy. Whether secret diplomacy has been particularly active this year is a merit or a crime has been specifically proven by this great war. At the same time, the truth is not within the scope of my article, so I will not say it now. What I want to point out here is that as the situation developed to the eve of this war, the rampantness of secret diplomacy in Europe had reached a terrible level. Therefore, even though the war has now been considered to have broken out, it is still completely impossible for us to thoroughly understand the true attitudes of various countries. In addition, besides secret diplomacy, there has also been a particularly developed activity of the propaganda weapons of various countries in recent years. This has added another layer of cover to all international activities, forming the current chaos and uncertainty of the truth.</p>
<p>However, precisely because of this, we have a greater need to look at the truth behind the bewildering surface of the kaleidoscope. Below, based on the existing data, I will use personal judgment and the results of discussions with everyone as tools to first try to draw a rough outline of this point. Of course, this is not writing history, and I plan to supplement it at any time in the future if I gain anything, perhaps by correcting it.</p>
<p>First, Germany's Invasion of Poland</p>
<p>A year ago, at this time, Hitler instigated and helped Poland, when Czechoslovakia ceded the Sudetenland to Germany, also took advantage of the fire to loot and forcibly ceded a piece of Czech territory near Taisun. In the spring, when Polish Foreign Minister Beck visited Germany, Hitler proposed the annexation of the Free City of Danzig in person. After Poland accepted the British guarantee of security, Hitler began to woo Poland. After the signing of the Anglo-Polish Mutual Assistance Agreement, he also strengthened his efforts to woo Poland through Mussolini, and used considerable intimidation. At this time, it had reached the eve of this war.</p>
<p>However, like a drama that has been closed for a long, long, long time, the curtain suddenly opened when everyone was waiting impatiently; and unexpectedly, what appeared on the stage was a German invasion of Poland!</p>
<p>Germany invades Poland? - This is unimaginable! It is something that has a hundred disadvantages and no advantages for Germany! In terms of the relationship between Germany and Poland, Hitler, like Zhuge Liang, shed tears and beheaded Ma Su; in terms of the relationship between Britain, France, and Germany, and the relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany, from now on, he is riding on the back of a tiger.</p>
<p>In terms of diplomatic operation, what Britain and France most hoped for was a German invasion of Poland. Germany has been enduring for the past few months, repeatedly postponing the annexation of Danzig, in order to guard against triggering a full-scale war with Poland. Poland dared to be excessively stiff, and even more fearless, because it was determined that Germany would not use force against it. Many observers may have disputed the evolution of other future international situations, but they are in unanimous agreement on this point: the possibility of compromise exceeds the possibility of war. But the fact is ultimately the fact, and Germany finally invaded Poland! (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e43">Xiangyin, the Gateway to Northern Hunan, Suffers Disastrous Bombing by Japanese Aircraft; People's Self-Defense Strength Has Increased <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Changsha dispatch: Xiangyin, bordered by rivers and lakes, is one of the most poetic and picturesque cities in the lakeside area of northern Hunan. The city is oval in shape, with a circumference of only about four li. However, the city is surrounded by weeping willows. Every spring and summer, the trees are lush and the rivers and lakes rise. From a distance, Xiangyin City looks like a piece of moss in the middle of the water, a green duckweed: "Rainbow dyke shadows east and west water, mirror lake light up and down the sky," "Light green double lakes generate evening waves, residual red eight scenes reside in the setting sun," "Distant harbor sails collect thousands of acres of blue, the setting sun shines on a river of red." These are all illustrations of Xiangyin left to us by our predecessors.</p>
<p>After the great fire in Changsha, a part of the disaster-stricken people of Changsha gathered in Xiangyin, making the Xiangyin city, which was located on the lakeside close to the front line, become prosperous again. For more than half a year this year, there was peace in northern Hunan. In addition, since the highways and railways were destroyed, the only traffic to and from northern Hunan was by waterway along the Xiang River. In this way, Xiangyin restored its past prosperity due to the war, and Xiangyin City also appeared particularly active. Xiangyin, which was in prosperity and revival, had just passed the Dragon Boat Festival in the old lunar calendar (June 21). After paying tribute to Qu Yuan, the doctor of the Three Questions, at Miluo River, who would have thought that on June 23 and 24, 15 Japanese planes each day would use Xiangyin City in the civilian area as a bombing target? Because the air defense facilities were simple and equivalent to nothing, and because the urban area was surrounded by water, there was nowhere to hide, the entire Xiangyin urban area was bombed and burned to the ground in five rounds of crazy bombing by Japanese planes for two days. Eighty or ninety percent of all houses in the city were bombed and burned. Residents, families, and even entire streets were bombed and burned, or buried alive in the rubble. The number of civilian casualties reached 3,000. The amount of loss exceeded the record of any city or town in Hunan Province that has suffered an air raid.</p>
<p>More than a month after Xiangyin was bombed, although the main streets have been cleaned up, thatched cottages and wooden houses have been built on some of the rubble. Some of the refugees are running their meager businesses to continue their weak lives. However, after surveying the entire area, I deeply feel that the losses suffered are far greater than the great fire in Changsha in terms of proportion. The only large building in the city, the Confucian Temple, which was splendidly built by the big merchant Huang Hongda, was also hit by several bombs, with dilapidated walls, broken tiles, broken beams and broken bricks, which was a sad sight.</p>
<p>The commercial district of Xiangyin was originally in the city. Since it was destroyed by Japanese aircraft, it has moved to the side of Wenxing Pagoda, about three miles outside the east gate, which was originally a scenic area. It continues to shoulder the important task of connecting the front and rear lines. Wenxing Pagoda has seven levels. Next to the pagoda, there are two lakes, east and west, with a bridge in the middle, called Wenxing Bridge. Looking north from the pagoda, Dongting Lake for eight hundred li is all in sight.</p>
<p>There are three major rivers flowing through Xiangyin County: the Xiang, the Zi, and the Miluo Rivers. The Zi River runs horizontally east of the county, dividing the north and south, while the Zi River runs vertically for more than 200 li in the west. Because the area is near the river and lake, there are fertile fields and embroidered fields connected to each other, which is a famous rice-producing area. It is said that Xiangyin County alone, in addition to supplying its own 710,000 people, usually exports 800,000 shi. This year is a rare harvest in 20 years. At least 1.5 million shi can be left over. Together with the lakeside counties, it can produce 8 million to 10 million shi more, providing food for the 2 million heroic soldiers who are fighting for the survival of the nation and the personality of the country for the next year, and we can "rest easy".</p>
<p>Xiangyin is the hometown of Zuo Zongtang and Guo Songtao. It has always attached importance to both military affairs and human culture. Especially military affairs, because of the development of the people's spirit, such as courage and willingness to take responsibility, if we can take advantage of the situation and strengthen their national and national consciousness, it is indeed a hope for the country. Unfortunately, in the past, the local authorities did not implement military service in a down-to-earth manner. Those with money bought strong men to replace military service with money. Those with power even shortened the age of 18 to 25 to under 18 and over 26, and increased the age under 40 to over 46. In this way, they evaded military service, so that those without money or power mostly hesitated and stayed away. "Drawing strong men" thus became "catching strong men." After the war spread to Jiangxi and Hubei, the counties of Hunan Province re-established the "Self-Defense Corps," but the funds for the Self-Defense Corps were mostly temporarily apportioned to the people every month, rather than planned as a whole, resulting in many people being hired to collect self-defense funds, with many malpractices and frequent disputes. As a result, "self-defense" became "self-disturbance." This phenomenon continued until the Japanese army invaded Yueyang and Xiangyin had become the first line approaching the front line before it gradually changed. Especially the people. In the bloody lessons of the two rapid bombings of the county seat, they increased their further understanding of the Japanese invasion. Not only will they never forget it, but they will also pass on this painful experience to every descendant, becoming a story to be vigilant about. Since then, the difficulty of conscription has been reduced, and there have been no more disputes over the funds of the Self-Defense Corps. The people have also voluntarily taken on self-defense work, because they have all understood the obligations and responsibilities that every citizen should fulfill.</p>
<p>If the Japanese army wants to use Dongting Lake and the Xiang River to attack the hinterland of Hunan Province, then Xiangyin is the place that both sides must contend for. However, here, every river, every harbor, has been blockaded by the Chinese army, every mound, every mountain, has solid fortifications and bunkers of the Chinese army, and every man and woman has consciously engaged in practical work to protect their hometown. Therefore, the recent northern Hunan front can be said to be as solid as gold.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Subei Yancheng Lost and Regained; Chinese Army Lures Japanese Army Deep; Japanese Army Suffers Great Losses <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Xinghua dispatch: The Japanese army that invaded Yancheng from Funing had about 600 or 700 infantry and artillery soldiers, and two iron-shelled small steamers and more than 20 civilian boats, advancing along the Fan Gong Dike and Chuanchang River by land and water, and violently harassing Yancheng. On the 17th, they broke through the Chinese army defense lines at Caoyankou and Shanggang. On the morning of the 18th, they approached Xinxingchang, north of Yancheng. The Chinese army believed that the Japanese army was coming with great momentum, and the positions between Gouandung and Shanggang were all destroyed by its artillery fire, so they changed their strategy to lure the enemy deep, transferred their forces to the east and west sides of the Fan Gong Dike, and encircled and annihilated them in one fell swoop. However, in order to prevent reinforcements from Funing, on the 18th, the Chinese army on both sides launched a fierce attack on the rear of the Japanese army at the same time. The strongholds of Shanggang Caoyankou and Gouandung were successively recovered. The advancing Japanese army ignored the rear and continued to advance at the risk. At about 5:00 p.m. on the 18th, they broke through the Chinese army defense line at Xinxingchang again. That night, they sneaked into Yancheng, but the Chinese army had already distributed its forces in the suburbs of Yancheng in advance. The people in the city had been evacuated a few days ago, and all the utensils had been moved out. Even the doors and windows and floors had been removed. Ten houses out of ten were empty, without a single object, and the city walls were demolished, making it easy to attack and difficult to defend. Therefore, after the Japanese army wanted to occupy Yancheng, it actually only obtained an empty city, without any gain. On the contrary, because they were surrounded on all sides, they felt a great threat. In anger, they set fire to many civilian houses. The Chinese military authorities had already planned to order the various armies to annihilate the Japanese army that had entered Yancheng. However, in panic, the Japanese army occupied Yancheng for one night, and suddenly fled Yancheng at about 3:00 p.m. on the 19th. It was reported that they fled to the north and northeast coast of Nanbeiyang, or detoured back to Funing. The Chinese military authorities immediately ordered the troops stationed along the way to intercept them, and all the plans and the Yancheng County Reserve Team had entered Yancheng at about 5:00 p.m. that day. This time, the Japanese army fled, and the iron-shelled steamers and civilian boats they drove were all intercepted by the Chinese army and had nowhere to escape.</p>
<p>In addition, it was reported that the Japanese army automatically fled north at about 3:00 p.m. on the 19th. When they passed near Shanggang, they were fiercely intercepted by the Chinese army headquarters, and were also attacked from the rear by the Chinese army pursuit troops. A fierce battle took place at this time. The Chinese army on the west side also participated in the encirclement and suppression. Although the Japanese army charged straight ahead, they were eventually surrounded by the Chinese army on many sides. After a fierce battle for four or five hours, because it was already dusk, the Japanese army broke through the Chinese defense line in different directions and fled north separately, but they had already been defeated. It is estimated that about 100 Japanese soldiers were killed in this battle, and more than 100 were injured. The Chinese army also destroyed two of their iron boats, captured a large number of military supplies, and seized a cannon. A remnant of the Japanese army fled east to Haihezhen, and another fled to Funing. The Chinese army is chasing them. The Chinese army re-entered Yancheng on the 20th, and the telephones have also been repaired. Personnel from various agencies have returned to the city to work. This time, the Japanese army's invasion of Yancheng suffered heavy losses, which was really not worth the loss.</p>
<p>It was also reported that after the autumn flood in northern Jiangsu, the Japanese army used small warships and rubber boats to divide their troops along the Grand Canal and Ze Lake to wreak havoc. Gaoyou and Baoying successively fell. The Chinese side lacked heavy weapons and lost and recovered them many times. On October 14, more than 300 Japanese soldiers, carrying small steel cannons and light and heavy machine guns, suddenly attacked Yancheng. The defenders, upon hearing the news, resisted desperately and fought for three days and nights. In the end, because the Japanese artillery fire was fierce, the city walls were cracked, and then there were street battles. They withdrew to the outskirts to await reinforcements. Commander Li rushed to the scene and led Brigade Commander Sun of the Security Brigade and Zhang Brigade to personally lead Chen's regiment and Staff Officer Ma to rush to the scene overnight. The artillery fire on both sides could be heard dozens of miles away. After a fierce battle until 3:00 p.m., more than half of the Japanese soldiers were killed or injured, and they abandoned the battle and retreated towards Fufuning. Shanggang, Yancheng, was recovered. The Japanese army was frightened upon hearing the news and heard that they were abandoning the Gao and Bao trends.</p>
<p>Education News</p>
<h3 id="e45">Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education Bans the Unauthorized Establishment of Middle Schools; Relocation of Addresses Must Also Be Approved <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Lishui dispatch) The Zhejiang Provincial Government has long stipulated that the establishment, change, or relocation of middle schools should be handled after being approved by the Department of Education. No enrollment shall be conducted before approval. Recently, some counties have established schools without following the regulations, and the Department of Education has separately banned them. In the future, if any county establishes secondary schools or branch schools, or high and junior high school student practice schools, or relocates to other places to enroll students without reporting to the department for approval, the county shall investigate and ban them in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>A Review and Prospect of Mass Education Centers</p>
<p>In the 24th year, the Implementation Plan for the Popularization of Mass Education Standards in County Rice Centers was promulgated. Zhejiang Province promulgated the Matters Needing Attention for the Establishment of Mass Education Centers in Counties and Cities in the 18th year, the Work Standards for Mass Education Centers in Counties and Cities in the 24th year, and the Regulations for Mass Education Centers in Counties and Cities in the 28th year. Other provinces and cities, such as the Measures for the Establishment of Mass Education Centers in Counties promulgated by Hebei Province, the Outline of Measures for the Preparatory Establishment of Mass Education Centers in Counties and Cities promulgated by Guangdong Province, the Outline of Measures for the Popularization of Mass Education Centers in Counties and Cities promulgated by Guangxi Province, and the Basic Requirements for County Mass Education Facilities promulgated by Yunnan Province. Provincial Mass Education Center Establishment General Rules, Nanjing City's Promulgated Outline of Measures for the Capital Mass Education Experimental Zone, etc., have detailed regulations for the establishment and facilities of mass education centers. In terms of social opinions,. Domestic educational magazines, such as Education Magazine, Chinese Education Circle, Teaching and Learning, Education and the Masses, Mass Education Quarterly, Mass Education Newsletter, and Shandong Mass Education Monthly, all publish articles on mass education centers, which are sufficient to represent the opinions of the general public. Education and the Masses and Shandong Mass Education Monthly have also published special issues on mass education centers to provide for discussions in various aspects. Mass education books include the Mass Education Center Implementation Method (edited by Lin), Education Center (edited by Peng), and Mass Education Center in Jiangsu (edited by Zong), etc. Other special investigations and studies include Huang Shang's survey of the organization of national public and private mass education centers, Wang Yucheng's survey of the organization of mass education centers in counties with reduced speed, Zhao Jiyu's survey of the organization of mass education centers in Zhejiang counties and cities, Zhao Yuan's survey of the results of soliciting opinions on the number of staff in mass education centers, Gu Shouen's statistics on the mass education center business in Jiangsu counties, and Jiang Ci'en's statistics on the mass education center business in Zhejiang counties. As for the progress of experimental work in various mass education centers and the promotion of general undertakings, it is even more difficult to list them all. In short, in the vigorous mass education movement in China, we cannot but say that the promotion of mass education centers is the most powerful.</p>
<p>Past Difficulties and Shortcomings: Mass education is a new undertaking, and mass education centers are newly established institutions. The difficulties of running a new undertaking with a newly established institution are conceivable. Moreover, the scope of mass education is extremely broad, the target of implementation is extremely complex, and the aspects involved are extremely numerous, making it even more difficult for the actual staff of mass education centers to know where to start. In addition, the personnel engaged in mass education centers rarely receive professional training, and are extremely poor in the beliefs, knowledge, and skills that should be possessed. Therefore, the difficulties and shortcomings of mass education centers occur anytime and anywhere, and we need to overcome and remedy them. Now let's give two examples. One is the Overview of Social Education in Sichuan from the 25th to the 27th years, printed by the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education. Regarding the lack of achievements of mass education centers, the following factors can be obtained:</p>
<p>(1) Lack of organizers: The current employees have neither research nor experience in running the masses.</p>
<p>(2) Lack of work plans in handling affairs, resulting in following the old ways and perfunctorily.</p>
<p>(3) The handling time is completely spent in the center, so that it is impossible to launch mass education work in a county or district.</p>
<p>(4) Most mass education centers have very little funding. In addition to salary expenses, there is a lack of funding to promote the business.</p>
<p>(5) The equipment of each center is too poor, far from the standard, and lacks sufficient tools to promote mass education.</p>
<p>(6) Local governments have not formulated standards and methods for supervising, assessing, leading, and promoting work.</p>
<p>(7) Local governments have failed to recognize the function of mass education centers themselves, and neither lead nor care.</p>
<p>The other is Zhu Zhixian's summary of the criticisms of mass education center facilities from many mass education experts and mass education people, which are nothing more than the following ten or so types:</p>
<p>(1) The facilities are mostly for entertainment purposes and have little educational significance. (2) The facilities are too complicated and mistakenly regard propaganda activities as educational purposes. (3) The work is too scattered. (4) The business has no center. (5) The teaching area is too large. (6) There is no fixed target. (7) The facilities are mostly empty and do not meet the needs. (8) Most of the organizers cannot recognize the core of the problem. (9) They pay too much attention to the inside of the center and ignore the outside. (10) They fail to really go to the people. (11) Most mass education centers are located in cities. (12) They cannot train and organize the masses in a timely manner. (13) They only pay attention to the development of quantity and less to the improvement of quality. (14) The work plan is mostly formulated by the主管.</p>
<p>The two examples given above, one is published by the educational administrative organ, and the other is published by the people engaged in mass education in various places, which can well represent the general difficulties and shortcomings of mass education centers.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Recent News from the Chongqing Municipal Mass Education Center <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing dispatch) After the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs received the "Regulations on Mass Education Centers" promulgated by the Ministry of Education in May of the 28th year, it selected members and the director of the center in accordance with the regulations in June of this year. Therefore, the center formulated various rules and regulations in accordance with the regulations, selected capable staff, and established four departments: General Affairs, Livelihood, and Art. Two rules and regulations, a work outline, and a calendar were compiled and printed, and implemented since early June. Now, after four months, its work can be said as follows:</p>
<p>1. Central Work - Eliminating Illiteracy - Chongqing City originally had a Wartime Mass Supplementary Education Promotion Committee, which was responsible for setting up mass schools to eliminate illiteracy. The meeting place was located in the Mass Education Center. Since the Mass Education Center takes the elimination of illiteracy in the city as its central work, it makes every effort to assist the promotion association in setting up mass schools, and urgently implements the literacy education of the Mass Education Center, such as publishing mass wall newspapers, expanding the mass library reading room, holding organized literacy movements, establishing mass writing agencies, creating mobile library cars, adding book and newspaper circulation points to various specially-appointed mass teahouses, and setting up mobile popular lecture stations at various traffic intersections, all of which are dedicated to the elimination of illiteracy. The establishment of advanced reading clubs is one of the steps to further improve the cultural level.</p>
<p>2. General Work - In addition to the central work - eliminating illiteracy, other general work includes assisting self-government, promoting production, improving health, improving customs, guiding entertainment, and wartime rear work. Within the recent four months, the following have been held: setting up a lecture on common sense of self-government, promoting various memorial day activities, a small loan introduction office, a job placement agency, various training classes for workers, supplementary classes for shop assistants and staff, rectifying public gymnasiums, holding anti-drug movements, economy movements, setting up listening rooms, specially-appointed teahouses, chess competitions, drawing research associations, one-month research associations, and various anti-Japanese propaganda, picture exhibitions, soliciting winter clothes, comforting wounded soldiers, and families of soldiers on expeditions, etc. Before an event is held, there is a precise plan. During the process, there is careful and detailed organization and steps, so the results are all satisfactory. Therefore, the spiritual support is happy, and society mostly praises it.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong dispatch) In the Hong Kong Zu Wu A-League, the Nanhua brothers went their separate ways. The South team defeated Scott 5-1 without much effort. The Hua team fought hard against the police, and drew 4-4 in a storm. In yesterday's game, several players from Nanhua suddenly "went on strike." Li Tiansheng from the South team and Yang Shuipan from the Hua team were both absent. This was due to friction in the understanding of the association, which led to this episode. The South team went to So Kon Po. Because Tiansheng was tired of duty, Liang Rongzhao was transferred to the left inner guard and Liu Songsheng was appointed as the right forward. This arrangement was still appropriate. The Scott team did not match the original plan. Goalkeeper Deng Qin was not seen, and still by Chiller. The three new generals, Manaho Road, Saroni, and Jianwu, also. He had only met Shangjian once, so the entire front line was not as complete as when he fought the police last week. Therefore, our army was hit head-on and suffered a crushing defeat. According to the first round of last year, Nanhua defeated Scott 10-0, but in the second round, Nanhua was humiliated 0-1. This time, before the meeting, it was difficult to determine who would win. Scott's combat ability is very mysterious. No matter whether the opponent is strong or weak, most of them end in a draw. But yesterday's answer was 5-1, and Nanhua South again reported a victory.</p>

<p>The Nanhua Hua vs. Police game was held at the Boundary Street Stadium. The Nanhua Hua generals regarded the stadium as a difficult place to go, and had been wary for a long time. Yang Shuiyi was to participate in the war, and Lu Dakeng played the right wing in reverse. The front line was uneven, and it looked like it would be a difficult one. Fortunately, the members fought to the end. Hou Rongsheng and Yang Genbao were both injured in the brave battle, but they still struggled desperately. After a fierce battle, they divided the eight goals and ended in a draw. In this battle, Lu Dakeng scored one goal for Nanhua Hua, Guo Yingqi scored one goal, and Yang Genbao scored two goals.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Finance: Four Days of Continuous Loosening; Foreign Exchange Market Suddenly Reverses; Japanese Banks Begin Aggressively Buying; Demand Exceeds Supply, Market Conditions Tighten <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the exchange rate announced by HSBC. The situation in the unofficial British and American exchange markets, after four days of sharp loosening, suddenly turned around. Generally, those who intentionally bought in began to take the opportunity to settle, and their lineup was very strong, so the reaction was particularly strong. The five-penny mark for British gold was briefly broken. The market opened flat in the morning, and was slightly firmer due to light trading. However, although there were repeated sell-offs from foreign telegrams and Chinese businesses thereafter, it was unexpected that HSBC's appetite suddenly became strong, and coupled with favorable buying intentions, the market became tight and soft. Subsequently, Japanese banks, such as Zheng Jin, and foreign firms began to buy, and American banks such as Chase Manhattan covered shorts and bought, so the buying trend gradually expanded and tightened step by step. Until around 2 p.m., British gold had retreated into the five-penny mark, to 4 pence 96875, and the US exchange rate had fallen to 8.1875 yuan. Finally, after HSBC and others searched extensively, the number of chips felt lacking. Afterwards, yarn and flower dealers came to the market to supply, and the situation slightly loosened, with British gold at 5 pence 0625 and the US exchange rate at 8.4375 yuan. However, at the close, British gold was still reported at 5 pence 015625 and the US exchange rate was 8.34375 yuan, a rebound of 234375 compared to the previous day, and a softening of 40625 for the US dollar. Futures trading was very rare, and the trend was like the spot market. Trading was still brisk throughout the day.</p>
<p>American Banks Also Covered Shorts</p>
<p>In the morning, the London long-term for British gold was 0625 recently and 3125 in the long term, the New York silver price was reduced by one-fifth, the London raw gold was stable, and the exchange rate for British against US and against France was still flat, and against Shanghai it rose by 1875. The US against British and against France were all flat, and against Shanghai it rose by two jiao five fen. The central exchange rates announced by the banks were as before. The banks opened the spot selling price in the morning at 5 pence 25 for British gold and 8.75 yuan for the US exchange rate, with no change from the previous close. After opening, the situation was slightly firmer, with British gold called over 5 pence 28125 and the US exchange rate called over 8.78125 yuan, but there was little trading. The exchange rate announced by HSBC did not move, and the silver balance tax was announced to be more than half a point. Thereafter, although foreign telegrams and speculators sold, HSBC took the opportunity to absorb them, and favorable factors also bought in, so the market conditions tended to tighten and soften. HSBC and favorable parties bought spot British gold from foreign telegrams and Chinese businesses at 5 pence 25 and 1875, respectively. Then, favorable parties again took in spot US exchange from American banks at 8.6875 yuan and 625, respectively. Later, Japanese banks and Zheng Jin followed suit with aggressive buying, and importers also did not buy, and it was heard that American banks also covered shorts, so the market situation became softer. Zheng Jin and foreign firms bought spot British gold from foreign banks from 5 pence 1875, tightened to 09375, and spot US exchange from 8.625 yuan, softened to 4375. At noon, it continued to tighten step by step, extending to 5 pence 0625, and the US exchange rate was only 8.375 yuan. It was heard that the state after closing was even softer, with British gold tightening to 5 pence 03125 and the US exchange rate softening to 8.3125 yuan.</p>
<p>British Gold Once Entered the Five-Penny Mark</p>
<p>The market continued to tighten step by step after the initial opening of the afternoon market. First, Japanese banks came to act again, and British gold even broke into the five-penny mark, once calling over 4 pence 96875, and the US exchange rate also called over 8.1875 yuan. After entering, it was said that a certain British bank lacked legal tender head positions, and the Chinese yarn and flower dealers took advantage of the high price to sell, and it slightly rebounded to 5 pence 0625 for British gold and 8.4375 yuan for the US exchange rate. However, Juzi late received the bank's spot selling price, and British gold softened again to 5 pence 015625, and the US exchange rate also tightened to 8.34375 yuan. The November British gold was 4 pence 984375, and the US exchange rate was 8.28125 yuan, compared with the previous day's spot British average of 234375, and the US was all hardened by 40625.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Following Foreign Exchange, the Gold Market Also Rebounds; Re-enters the 3,700 Yuan Mark <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold (shà chì) market conditions regained its luster as the foreign exchange market softened. The gains for the day offset the losses of the previous day. However, the market opened with a sharp drop of 46 yuan, opening at a low price of 3,610 yuan. This was because the foreign exchange market was still soft at this time, and a certain money exchange business was selling with all its strength. However, the foreign exchange market suddenly tightened sharply, which boosted the morale of buyers. Gold shops and securities firms aggressively bought without stopping, and the Hong Kong businesses also had a good appetite. Also, near noon, a certain money exchange business that had sold in the morning also entered the market to buy back, and the price soared to 3,705 yuan. By noon, it had fallen slightly to 3,697 yuan. In the afternoon, the buying was still strong, and it rose again to a high peak of 3,755 yuan. It was not until the foreign exchange market slightly hardened again that some daily profit-takers spit out, and the price broke into the 3,700 yuan mark. Finally, because foreign exchange was still tight, the market closed at 3,725 yuan. As a result, it rose 60 yuan compared with the previous day. Trading was brisk throughout the day, with around 1,800 to 1,900 taels traded. Gold jewelry shops finally listed a large five yuan increase, and customs gold and other prices remained flat.</p>
<p>Shà Chì Recovers 69 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the atmosphere was such that money exchange businesses such as Qian Tai were pressing down prices to sell. At the same time, buyers lacked appetite. Bǎi actually pressed down 46 yuan, and the money exchange business sold 30 taels to the Qian Tai gold shop for 3,610 yuan. After a while, a certain gold shop came to pull up the price, and it rose by 20 yuan. A certain gold shop bought 20 taels from a peer for 3,630 yuan. Those who came to buy later were slightly lacking, and the price was pressed down slightly to 3,615 yuan. Then, because the foreign exchange report was tight, and it was heard that HSBC was buying, it suddenly aroused the excitement of speculators, and securities firms and gold shops competed to buy. At the same time, customers also came to drag in, so the price rose by 55 yuan. A gold jewelry shop bought 50 taels of cash from a gold shop for 3,670 yuan. Later, some retail bulls sold, and the price fell back to 3,655 yuan. However, soon after, because the foreign exchange report was soft, it soared again to 3,680 yuan. Subsequently, because securities firms came out to take profits, the price fell again to 3,655 yuan. Around 11:00 a.m., it was heard that the foreign exchange tightness was intensifying, and the atmosphere was rising. A certain money exchange business that had sold out in the morning suddenly came back to buy, and broke out of the 3,700 yuan mark. A certain money exchange business escaped the securities firm for 30 taels for 3,705 yuan. By the time of the close, it had fallen slightly. The money exchange business did 50 taels mutually, with an afternoon price of 3,697 yuan. It was heard that the price after the close was due to foreign exchange softening, and a certain money exchange business and securities firm bought a total of 30 taels of cash from the gold shop at a price of 3,720 yuan. The initial opening in the afternoon was strong, 20 yuan higher than the off-market price. The money exchange business bought 30 taels from the securities firm for 3,740 yuan. Then, because a certain money exchange business continued to buy, and the foreign exchange British gold reached five pence, it rose another 15 yuan. The money exchange business did 50 taels mutually for 3,755 yuan. It was heard that the foreign exchange rebounded slightly, and the long parties who had made profits came out, and at the same time, the gold jewelry shops also sold short quite actively, so the price plunged straight down 65 yuan. The gold jewelry shop bought 30 taels from the money exchange business for 3,690 yuan. After entering, because the foreign exchange softened slightly again, the securities firm then came to pull up the price, and it rose again by 30 yuan. The securities firm bought 10 taels from the gold shop for 3,725 yuan, with a late closing price. As a result, it recovered 69 yuan compared to the previous day, which was a rebound after falling for four consecutive days for a total of nearly 166 yuan. It was heard that after the close, a certain gold shop bought 10 taels from the gold jewelry shop, and the price father raised five yuan, for 3,730 yuan. Throughout the day, the price fluctuated by 145 yuan. The selling price of the cash gold shop's brand-name gold was 10 yuan higher than Shà Chì, and the purchase price was reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current standard gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Was Also Listed Up Five Yuan</p>
<p>The initial exchange price for jewelry gold per tael at the gold jewelry shop was still 370 yuan at Da Tong Hang. Then, at 11:10 a.m., it was listed up five yuan. At 2:05 p.m., it was father up five yuan. At 3:15 p.m., it fell back five yuan. As a result, it was up five yuan. Da Hui Hang changed the listing to 375 yuan. The new peers were the same as the above price, and the purchase price had to be reduced by 15 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Foreign Currencies Rise One After Another <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw many customers take the opportunity to absorb them because they had fallen quite a bit in recent days. The demand for British and American gold pounds and gold notes turned strong, and the market price rose sharply. The Hong Kong note rose sharply due to the tightening of the Hong Kong exchange rate. The rise of the Netherlands note and the Canada note was more moderate. The demand for French francs, Singapore, and Annam notes was not strong, and the market price was stable. The supply of Japanese gold notes suddenly increased, and the evening market was 1 yuan 3 jiao and 09 li. The trading of Korean notes turned rare, and the evening market was 1 yuan and 09 fen. Yesterday's market price was 1 yuan for British gold pounds, 1 yuan and 5 jiao for British gold notes, 5 jiao for American gold pounds, 5 jiao and 7 fen for American gold notes, 1 jiao for Hong Kong notes, 5 fen for Netherlands notes, 2 jiao for Canada notes, and other currencies did not change.</p>
<h3 id="e57">The "Harmonious" Hua Xing Jiao Notes <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of Hua Xing Bank, it has intended to control the economy in the occupied areas. Unfortunately, the people's hearts have not died. Except for forced matters, such as paying donations and taxes, which must be settled with the bank's banknotes, the rest still uses legal tender. In addition to yuan banknotes, the bank also issues jiao notes. The front is as shown in the attached picture, and the back is printed with the words "One Jiao" and "10 Cents". The four corners are divided into hollow "I" and "One" characters. Both sides are green, and the back is slightly lighter. The printing pattern, design, and font are known at a glance to be "harmonious". (Pure)</p>
<h3 id="e58">Securities: Grade C Re-enters the Gate <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial securities market gradually became weak in its struggle. Some bulls continued to come out, and Defu Lianhe and others still sold, so although Grades C and E had rediscovered the high price of 50 yuan, they trended downward. At the same time, foreign exchange shrank, gold rose, and people's hearts were also slightly tired. Therefore, Grade C actually broke the 9 yuan price again. Environmental news and rumors varied, and people's hearts were therefore dazed. In the initial opening yesterday morning, due to the eagerness of buyers and the raising of prices by many parties, the opening price of Grades C and E was 50 yuan. However, the supply from the sellers did not stop, and the wind suddenly turned, gradually trending downward. The difference between high and low at noon was as much as eight jiao. Therefore, when gold turned up in the afternoon, the bond market felt more and more powerless to go down three or five jiao again. As a result, it fell back five jiao and a half to eight jiao and a half. The total number of transactions was about one million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Close Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 58.95 58.35 58.25 Down 0.85</p>
<p>Unified B 51.10 50.55 50.55 Down 0.75</p>

<p>Unified E 50.00 48.95 49.10 Down 0.60</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 50 shares of stock were traded on the exchange, with a price of 29 yuan and 2 jiao and a half.</p>
<p>London, 30th telegram, today's listed prices of stocks of various British companies in the Far East rose uniformly. The price of the Mccallie Bank stock rose by 2 shillings and 6 pence to 7 pounds and 15 shillings. The price of the HSBC Bank stock rose by 1 pound each, the price of the stocks registered in London rose to 78 pounds, and the price of the stocks registered in Hong Kong rose to 79 pounds. The price of the Yulei Bank stock rose by 5 shillings to 11 pounds. The price of the open Ping Coal Mine bearer stocks was 1 shilling and 9 pence, and the price was 15 shillings and 6 pence.

<h3 id="e59">Yarn: The Yarn Market Turns Stable <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had fallen sharply the previous day, showed a slight turnaround and recovery yesterday. At the same time, although customers did not purchase in large batches, the retail transactions of Hong Kong customers were more active, and people's hearts felt more stable. The trend was slightly consolidated, but after the price increase, large households still had a strong intention to sell. Judging from the market situation, it was not far from a hovering state. As for the meeting point, there were more customers gathered in the exchange, so trading was more active at the new site. However, the market prices differed, giving more opportunities for scalpers. The transaction price of 20-count Double Horse on the exchange board was up to 639 yuan, but the price on the New World board was only 632 yuan. By the time of the close, the price on the exchange had fallen back to 632 yuan, but on the other side it had rebounded to 637 yuan. It can be imagined that the market prices in the two places were mixed and disorderly. This situation is ultimately not a blessing for the yarn industry.</p>
<p>In the morning, Guangbang customers came one after another, all in the exchange. Peers began to trade 10 bales of 20-count Earth for 610 yuan, a drop of more than 10 yuan. Then, as customers had some intention of buying, the momentum gradually rose, and 20-count Variant Horse rose from 628 yuan to 639 yuan. Later, as there were slightly more sellers at high prices, the price fell back. It was found that 685 bales were traded in half a day, and 345 bales were traded the previous day, for a total of 1,030 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse rose in the market, and the prices of Tian Nu and San Xing were flat and increased by five yuan, respectively. 750 pieces of export yarn were shipped to Tianjin today. The amount purchased by each gang is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Peers 470 Hong Kong 145</p>
<p>Jiangxi 20 Xiamen 40</p>
<p>Previous Day's Transactions 345 Total 1,030</p>
<p>Afternoon news was that foreign exchange had shrunk and people's hearts had been invigorated. The asking price for 20-count Double Horse was 647 yuan, and it was said that there was no buying. We will decide the winner tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Fire Machine Cotton Was Traded Yesterday; Sales Disks Showed No Movement Up or Down <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Cotton trading showed a slight improvement, but although Chinese factories had a way, only Hongzhang Factory took in 1,000 bales of white cotton. Other factories were still lackluster, and Japanese factories were increasingly silent, so the market was still calm. As for the sales disk, it was about the same as the previous day. The source of Northern Jiangsu was again enthusiastic. There were 3,597 bales of Tonghua cotton and 270 bales of Beisha cotton arriving at the dock. The sales disk of spot cotton is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton 229.00 Peer 400 bales</p>
<p>129.80 400 bales</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton 130.00 Peer 200 bales</p>
<p>Tongzhou Packed 137.0. Peer 200 pieces</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton 22.50 Peer 800 bales</p>
<p>113.00 800 bales</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton 115.00 Hongzhang 1,000 bales</p>
<p>In addition, the foreign cotton trading in Shanghai was extremely sluggish due to the loosening of the exchange rate. Factories and peers were all adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Futures trading was also very light. All parties' thoughts were focused on the current changes in the exchange rate. If the current exchange rate can indeed stand stable, then foreign cotton trading may have a chance to turn around. I then the cotton market will be quiet for a normal period of time.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was very firm in the morning. Telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai both reported rising prices. The number of sales of piece goods has been increasing daily, so spot trading has become active, and trading among peers has also increased. European demand is also quite strong. As a result, the closing price was 4 pounds higher than the previous day. India's forecasts rose more than one rupee, Egypt rose more than ten pounds, and Liverpool rose three or five pence.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Food: Arrivals Surge, Sales Clear; Japonica and Indica Are Difficult to Reinvigorate <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>After the Japonica rice market turned sluggish once in the afternoon market yesterday, the opening trend was weak yesterday. The arrivals from various districts suddenly surged, with three or four thousand bales of goods from Chang, Kun, Su, Jia, Qing, and Jiao, which made people feel discouraged. If the new Japonica is because the local stores are sluggish, and the arrivals are particularly large, and the rice quality is weak, it is not easy to defend for a long time. General customers do not agree with each other, and they urgently seek to sell goods, so the market is difficult to support, and the falling wind becomes more and more fierce. Until the close of the market, the market price has been shortened by seven jiao to one yuan compared with the previous market, and the transaction is still clear. It is estimated that Changxi Te japonica was traded for 30 yuan and 7 jiao, and the middle ones were 27 or 8 yuan. Su Tong Kunshan and other japonica were all around 27 or 8 yuan. Among the green seed kiln species and Bai Ge, except for Bai Ge, which was out of stock and had no market, the kiln and green species were even less asked about in this tired situation. At the close of the market, the high-quality Qing Jiao green seeds were decided from 30 yuan and 2 jiao and a half to 29 yuan, and the kiln species were decided from 29 yuan and 8 jiao to 28 yuan and a half. The rest, such as the broken yuan, were all oversupplied and fell by four or five jiao.</p>
<p>After Kexian (客秈) saw a rising wind due to the scarcity of goods, it did not soar at all during this week. However, after the news that the producing areas had opened up the borders spread before noon, it turned sluggish once. The market shape was weak yesterday morning, because Kexian had created this high price in recent days, first, because of the scarcity of goods, and second, because of the agitation of the minds of large hoarders. The feet were weak, and the local real stomach had already been guarded against, so except for the urgent need at that time, they were also watching with folded arms. When it suddenly became tired, people's hearts became more scrupulous, and they did not dare to ask about it if they did not cut through. As a result, whether it was retail or wholesale, the go-ahead was unusually wooden. The hoarders took this opportunity to throw out the goods in groups in order to avoid losses, so the market was filled with goods in an instant, and the situation fell step by step. By noon, the price had fallen by nearly one yuan, before the local stores moved out, and the market shape gradually tightened. Therefore, as a result, the price of each Kexian was 6 or 7 jiao lower than the previous market. According to statistics, more than 6,000 bags of Dukexian were traded in the whole city.</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Flour Market Is Silent; High Prices and Sluggish Sales; Wheat Buyers and Sellers Standstill <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The going-ahead of the current flour from the Nanyang gang has turned lazy, and the Beiyang gang is also rarely enthusiastic. Because the factory disk has increased after this street, escaping the stomach also does not take it, so the market has gradually flattened after rising. However, each factory is selling firmly because the raw material price is expensive at the moment. The floating stock of the returned goods in the market has also dried up early, so the transaction is even more silent. The total market transaction is only more than 20,000 bags. The factory disk continues to open at 7 yuan and 4 jiao, and those who directly distribute to customers still need 7 yuan and 5 jiao or 6 jiao, but it is not an official market situation.</p>
<p>The source of wheat is still scarce, and transportation in various places has been repeatedly difficult. Those who hold goods are inevitably hoarding, so the circulating goods in the market are decreasing day by day, and the factories also intend to suppress the price to buy, so the market is gradually in a standstill state. As a result, the factory's selling price has risen by another one jiao. It is estimated that 2,000 bags were purchased from the Fu and Fu factories, and it is difficult for hoarders to eat the disk any higher, only 2 or 3 cars were purchased, and the price was 11 yuan, 3 jiao, 3 fen to 3 jiao, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Oil Market: Soybean Oil Continues to Fall One Yuan and a Half <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Although a few hoarders are holding on to good prices in yesterday's market, the batch of sources can be continued, so people's hearts are fluctuating, and some goods households have gradually sold out. Yesterday, Kobe oil fell by one yuan and a half in the market, but only 10 barrels were traded, and the price was 67 yuan and 5 jiao. Dalian oil fell by five jiao, and 120 barrels were traded, and the price was 66 yuan and 8 jiao. Qingqi oil was cut by eight jiao, and 100 pieces were traded, and the price was 48 yuan and 5 jiao. Yanqi oil was less than half a yuan, and 400 pieces were traded, and the price was 49 yuan and 5 jiao. The go-ahead is still only the gardens on this street, and there is no transaction with the inland gang.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Sugar Market: National Sugar Improves <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, National Sugar opened 450 bags of Diaozhiqing because the Yong sales were gradually moving, and the price was 34 yuan. Huizhou white also had a good return. The special high-quality goods opened at 58 yuan, Shen Block at 55 yuan, and the second at 51 yuan. Hundreds of bags were traded, and it was heard that the miscellaneous road Qing also had transactions, but the price was not detailed. Foreign sugar also turned good because the foreign exchange shrank slightly. The association allocated the disk, and the spot 24 coarse white rose by one yuan to eight jiao, this stack was 53 yuan, and the foreign stack was 53 yuan and a half to 3 yuan and 8 jiao, and the transshipment goods was 43 yuan, an increase of one yuan. The Taikoo car white rose by half a yuan to one yuan, B was 57 yuan cattle to 58 yuan, and the car red and He red were lack of change. This cotton white Zhenji No. 1 was 54 yuan, No. 2 was 53 yuan and a half, No. 3 was 53 yuan, and No. 4 was 52 yuan and a half. This No. 1 ice was 65 yuan, and Pinming was 66 yuan and a half, all up one yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e65">North and South Goods: Lan Zhuzhi Production Price Steps Up <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Lan Zhuzhi (蘭竹枝) is being purchased separately in different producing areas, and the inventory is gradually scarce, so the purchase price is rising day by day. The price increase before and after the lowest price must increase by six-tenths. The goods of the goods customers who transport Shen all want to increase the price, but they know that the sales areas such as Hangzhou are recently selling down due to the emergency situation, so the line is not strong, and they intend to suppress the price, so they have become a standstill situation.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Seafood: Qilin Vegetable Falls Back <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The Long Ya Qilin vegetable was sold for 48 or 9 yuan last week. Because the go-ahead was scattered, the trend was flat. If the recent transactions have fallen back by 2 yuan, it will be 47 yuan. The same disk of Xilan vegetable has gone 3 yuan less than before. The Lion Hair vegetable has been cut off and there has been no continuation.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Pepper Is Tired <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The previous market for White Pepper, such as Wen Island goods, was 160 yuan, and the Dutch goods were 140 yuan. Although it is still called the original disk recently, there is no transaction, and the situation is very sluggish, so black pepper has seen a fallback. The current No. 1 pepper and black big pepper are sold together for 93 yuan, which is 5 yuan less than the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Silk and Tea: Unpredictable Silk Prices <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk market experienced another surge. Yokohama spot prices jumped by 100 yuan, and forward prices rose by 111 yuan, which was quite unexpected. New York Japanese silk rose by 11.1 to 18.8 cents, while Chinese silk increased by 2 to 8 cents. Exchange prices for the near term increased by 15 cents, with trading limited. Forward prices rose by 13.5 cents.</p>
<p>Silk prices are usually at their lowest in April and May, and tend to rise towards the end of the year from October, reaching a peak due to seasonal supply and demand. However, recently, Japanese and American silk prices have often soared. While seasonal factors are a reason, the unrest in the Far East and Europe has inevitably deepened, affecting economic life. Price fluctuations are thus unpredictable, as they follow the tide.</p>
<p>The local silk market in Shanghai was previously quite weak. Yesterday, influenced by the overseas price increases, it became difficult to find a reliable benchmark for silk prices. Consequently, foreign firms and silk merchants adopted a wait-and-see attitude, only tentatively inquiring with each other. No transactions were reported yesterday, either by foreign firms or local merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Market Summary <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Miscellaneous:  There was a slight increase in the arrival of jujubes, and prices also decreased by a small amount of two or three yuan.  Telegrams from Jinan reported an increase of one yuan.  Shanghai merchants sold at prices as low as five or six yuan, with a small number opening sales, even higher than before.</p>

<p>White Coal:  Sentiment regarding white coal prices has been wavering since the severe drop in Hongji prices.  No transactions have occurred for even one ton.  However, Haifeng white coal has a substantial inventory, but it was released earlier, so the price remains at the original level, with bulk coal at 116 yuan per ton.  Dock handling and brokerage fees are added separately.</p>
<p>New Lead Wire: Yesterday, the market was lively due to procurement from Tianjin, Qingdao, and other northern regions, leading to increasing prices.

<h3 id="e70">Surrounded on All Sides - Fierce Battles Near Shanghai Suburbs Yesterday - Residents in Western Shanghai Heard Heavy Artillery Fire - Over a Thousand Chinese Troops Arrived at Baoshan Fort Taiwan - 1,500 Japanese Soldiers Wounded or Killed in Changzhou <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, residents in western Shanghai heard intermittent and intense artillery fire last night (30th) and this morning (31st). The sound initially came from the Qingpu area, then from the Xujiahui Railway Station. Many people were awakened by the loud noises last night. From 5:30 AM to 10:30 AM this morning, despite the usual urban noise, loud explosions could still be heard, and smoke and explosions were seen from the Xujiahui Station area.</p>
<p>Qingpu Battles Moved to the Suburbs</p>
<p>Xujiahui Station is located on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, which has been cut off by guerrillas more than once in recent weeks. According to brief news received this morning, fierce battles took place last night between Japanese troops and guerrillas west of Hongqiao Airfield along the Qingpu Road. The fighting then shifted toward the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, near the Xujiahui Station. It is believed that the guerrillas had to continue fighting after dawn and retreated toward the railway area in order to make contact with other regular troops. The anti-Japanese army continues its attacks.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Heavily Deployed Around Longhua</p>
<p>According to Chinese news from the Nanshi area, Japanese troops were deployed around Longhua Road in the Nanshi area yesterday afternoon. Japanese troops were also seen moving around, with several trucks carrying small cannons heading southwest of Shanghai. A large number of light and heavy machine guns were also transported to the area.</p>
<p>Fierce Battles Occur Frequently Around Shanghai-Hangzhou</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Japanese Army in Shanghai stated today that the Japanese garrison in Jiaxing has been conducting operations to expel guerrillas in a vast area near the city since October 15th. Between Xitang and Taozhuang, 30 kilometers northeast of Jiaxing, they clashed with the 8th Regiment of the newly formed 30th Division of the Chinese army, resulting in 4 Japanese soldiers killed and 9 wounded. On October 15th, Japanese troops clashed with guerrillas twice, 10 kilometers southeast of Fengjing on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, resulting in casualties on both sides.</p>
<p>Chinese Regular Troops Open Fire on Taiwan Fort</p>
<p>According to visitors from Baoshan, the city of Baoshan used to have a garrison of over 100 Japanese soldiers, but they have all been transferred recently due to the pressing situations in the Xiangbei (northern Hunan) and Jinxi (western Shanxi) battlefields. Only a dozen or so Japanese soldiers remain, along with Japanese advisor Nakajima and several special agents. In addition, there are over 20 puppet police officers and local ruffians forming a puppet "county government" that extorts and harasses the local population. Recently, the puppet "county government" planned to force the heads of each neighborhood to report household information and draft young men to sacrifice for the Japanese side. Upon hearing this, the residents of the city panicked and fled, and the local heads of neighborhoods also moved elsewhere to seek temporary refuge. Currently, the puppet "government's" power only extends to the city itself. One or two miles outside the city, the area is under the control of guerrillas. Furthermore, over 5,000 fully equipped Chinese armed troops recently arrived at Fort Taiwan southeast of Baoshan City and are constructing fortifications there. Local residents are willing to serve and are paid accordingly. It is reported that the Chinese army will contact the guerrillas in the surrounding areas and launch a general attack on the county seat as soon as the opportunity arises.</p>
<p>Heavy Casualties for Japanese Troops in Changzhou</p>
<p>According to people from Changzhou who fled to Shanghai, in order to support the Xiangbei battlefield and contain Japanese forces, the Chinese high command dispatched about 30,000 men from the 63rd Division and other units to the southwest of Changzhou. They advanced northward in several routes from the base areas around Yixing Zhangzhu, Fan Liyang, and attacked Japanese strongholds and the railway line. Upon receiving orders, the regular troops were fully equipped.</p>
<p>Hai Customs Wharfs for Passenger Embarkation and Disembarkation Managed by Water Police - Taking Over Piers 9, 10, and 11 From Today - Shanghai Municipal Police Retains Authority Over These Three Piers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the Water Police will take over the management of Piers 9, 10, and 11, and the areas in front of these piers, from November 1st. The earlier report that the Shanghai Municipal Police would cede full management authority of the Bund to the Water Police is inaccurate. The Water Police used to handle the police affairs of the customs wharfs together with the Police Department. According to the new system, the Water Police will manage the customs wharfs and piers along the Bund where passengers embark and disembark, and provide better policing. The Water Police will also manage ships arriving at or leaving the piers, and other matters previously handled by the Shanghai Municipal Police within the Jianghai Customs. However, the Shanghai Municipal Police will retain management authority over these three piers and the Water Police will assist in the management.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Extended Period for Soliciting Funds for Winter Clothing - Shanghai Offers Double the Amount - Original Target of 200,000 Yuan Already Reached - Period Extended by One Month to Maximize Donations <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The solicitation of 200,000 yuan in funds for winter clothing in Shanghai has been underway since last month. The industrial, commercial, and cultural sectors have enthusiastically participated. In just two months, the target amount has been reached. The original deadline was today and tomorrow. Now, because the soldiers on the front lines are fighting hard and the refugees in the war zones are displaced and suffering, the funds for winter clothing should be collected in large quantities to meet the needs. Therefore, it has been decided to extend the solicitation period to November 3rd to maximize donations. At that time, in accordance with the national solicitation regulations, double the amount of 200,000 yuan will be presented to express the support and concern of all sectors of Shanghai for the soldiers and refugees.</p>
<p>Advancing Rapidly Northward</p>
<p>One unit encountered Japanese troops in Xiasi Town, west of Ge Lake in Changzhou, on October 25th and engaged in fierce battles. After several charges by the Chinese army, most of the 200 Japanese troops stationed in the town were wiped out. The remaining Japanese troops sent urgent telegrams to the city for reinforcements. However, the number of Japanese troops stationed in Changzhou was small, and the Chinese army's offensive was sudden and fierce. The "Changzhou Garrison Headquarters" telegraphed the Japanese military authorities in central China for help. Five thousand Japanese troops were dispatched from Xuzhou and Suzhou</p>
<p>To Rush to the Rescue</p>
<p>They advanced along the Wuli Road and Wuyi Road toward Xiasi, and dispatched five or sixty speedboats to attack towns along Ge Lake such as Dong'an and Houyu. Japanese planes also flew in from time to time to bomb. The Japanese troops besieged in Xiasi Town took the opportunity to break out of the encirclement and flee north. The Chinese army has now crossed Xiasi and is</p>
<p>Fiercely Attacking Northward</p>
<p>Dong'an Town had previously been invaded by Japanese troops landing there, but after a fierce counter-attack by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops, suffering too many casualties, boarded boats and fled. Since the outbreak of this battle, the scale and scope of the Chinese army's advance have been greater than in the past, causing great panic among the Japanese troops. For a week, Japanese military transport has been frequent on the railways and highways, and the conscription of laborers in the city has been intense. More than 400 city residents have been conscripted, and 200 to 300 people have been brought in from Suzhou and other places. As a result, the general public is also very panicked. Men from the middle and lower classes have almost disappeared from the city streets. All</p>
<p>Conscripted Laborers</p>
<p>Are forced to wear Japanese military uniforms and transport grain and ammunition for the Japanese army. Some are even sent to the front lines as vanguards. After a week of fierce fighting, the Japanese suffered about 1,500 casualties, and most of the Chinese laborers also died tragically. The Japanese army has been using trucks and boats to transport the bodies to the city for cremation in the public sports field. The so-called "Peace Alliance Army" transferred from Shanghai has also suffered heavy casualties. After this major blow, the Japanese army has been maintaining strict security in the suburbs and along the railway line. At night, anyone seen is shot at randomly, resulting in the unjust deaths of several innocent villagers every day.</p>
<p>Transferring Puppet Troops to the Front Lines</p>
<p>The Japanese troops stationed along the two roads are originally very thinly deployed. Recently, the Chinese guerrillas have been attacking the traffic on the two roads, and the Japanese army has been almost unable to cope. It is learned that the Japanese army has recently ordered the transfer of more than 1,000 puppet troops, newly recruited in the suburbs of Shanghai, to Changzhou, Hangzhou, and other places, and has changed their Japanese military uniforms in order to create a false show of strength.</p>
<p>Japanese and Puppet Troops Patrol in Teams at Night</p>
<p>The Japanese Military Police and the Puppet Police Brigade in western Shanghai, fearing that they will be annihilated by the Chinese army because of the large number of Chinese regular troops that have arrived in the suburbs of Shanghai and the growing strength of their forces, have taken special precautions since the night before last in order to prolong their lives. They have been divided into several small teams, fully equipped and deployed, patrolling the streets. Their actions are mysterious and their gatherings and dispersals are inconsistent, causing a small panic. The situation is becoming increasingly tense. Ghoulish Road is under curfew and pedestrians are prohibited. There are plainclothes teams or puppet police posts at the entrances of each alley, holding rifles and pretending to be stern.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops in Nanshi are Panicked</p>
<p>Recently, the guerrillas have been active in the border areas of Nanshi and the Shanghai-Minhang Road and Kunyun Shanghai West sections of Shanghai County, which have completely entered the heart of the Japanese-controlled area. They openly inspect traitors and restrict the entry of food into the Japanese-controlled area. The Japanese army does not dare to go deep beyond the highway line. In addition, most of the garrisoned troops have been transferred out and are insufficient. The newly replenished young soldiers have not experienced the battlefield and are childish and timid, and dare not attack. Therefore, the troops have retreated to the Gaochang Temple Longhua Road area. However, twice a day, they move out small cannons, machine guns, and large numbers of troops, and fire them on Longhua Road in a target-shooting style, which has been going on for almost a week. But at 5:00 PM, they all concentrate in the headquarters of the Gaochang Temple Arsenal and do not cross the line.</p>
<p>Shanghai Western District Negotiations - The Shanghai Municipal Council's Proposal to be Submitted to Board for Discussion</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that, according to well-informed sources, the Shanghai Municipal Council will submit the proposal to "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an to resolve the disputes in the four districts. It is now in the hands of the directors and will be carefully considered at the board meeting to be held tomorrow (1st), and then submitted to the puppet "municipal government." It is expected that representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Council and Fu Xiao'an will not meet to discuss this proposal until next week.</p>
<p>The New Voice Society reports that regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's proposed "construction plan" to resolve the issue of road construction beyond the Shanghai Western District, according to Japanese newspapers, it was submitted by Chief Inspector Fessenden to Fu Xiao'an on the evening of October 26th. However, according to Western newspapers close to the British side, the "proposal" has not yet been submitted to the Jiangwan "Municipal Government." Furthermore, according to the Shanghai Municipal Council's intelligence department, the "proposal" is now in the hands of the consular body and will be reviewed and considered by the consular body before being submitted to the "Mayor" of Jiangwan after a lengthy discussion at the board meeting to be held this afternoon. All rumors are speculative. Because the "Great Way Municipal Government" insists on taking over the management rights of the road construction area beyond the boundary, the views of both sides are too far apart, and there are many hidden reefs in future negotiations. It is said that the "Municipal Government" has formed a "special task force" to carry out its so-called maintenance of security and order for residents outside the boundaries of Shanghai Western District.</p>
<p>The October Settlement Period - Industries Successfully Navigate - The Four Banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, Agricultural Bank of China) Manage Discounted Loans to the Best of Their Ability</p>
<p>Yesterday was the October settlement period for Shanghai's industry and commerce, the only general settlement period for long-term credit loans. According to the results of negotiations between the borrowers and the 41 money houses regarding the long-term credit loans of 10 million yuan that expired yesterday, 7 to 8 million yuan were extended to the end of April next year or re-contracted to extend for one to six months, and 2 to 3 million yuan were repaid in full. Regarding new credit loans, it is reported that 2 to 3 million yuan were transacted, mostly for factories and businesses in the domestic goods industry. The Discount and Mortgage Committee of the Four Banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, Agricultural Bank of China) handled discounted and mortgaged loans until the end of October. It is reported that there is still a loan balance of more than 16 million yuan, and extensions are granted for loans that expire at the end of October. As for the financial market, it remains as stable as ever, and there have been no changes in various interest rates. The money market for foreign exchange yesterday decreased by 1.17 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e72">A Word for the Industrial and Commercial Circles - (One) <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Sanjie</p>
<p>Shanghai is one of the world's great commercial ports. The industrial and commercial businesses are changing with each passing day. Therefore, entrepreneurs and employees all use their intelligence and scheme against each other. Their spirit of striving and perseverance is truly worthy of admiration. However, business is limitless, but energy is limited. Isn't it harmful to one's health to constantly exert one's wisdom and worry? Yet these great figures, the greater their careers, the healthier their minds. They are all human beings, so how can they be so different? The reason is that they rely on tonics.</p>
<p>However, there are many types of tonics, and it is not easy to choose. If you buy substandard products, it will not only not benefit your body but also waste your money, which is a pity. I am not afraid of wordiness and would like to offer you a target for purchasing.</p>
<p>According to the Zhengwei Pharmacy (main store opposite the Great Stage on Second Ma Road) (branch store at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Carter Road), the "Wei Ling Malt Essence Cod Liver Oil" that they distribute has the effect of strengthening the body and brain. "Wei Ling Pure Cod Liver Oil" has the effect of nourishing the lungs and replenishing deficiency. "Seahorse Essence", a new blood tonic specifically for treating anemia and blood loss, has been distributed for a long time and is popular throughout the country. They have the reputation of being the "Three Heroes of Tonics." The reason is that the manufacturing factors of the above three tonics are first based on ethical principles, so regarding the formulation of ingredients, the purity of extraction, and the strictness of supervision, they are all based on academic theory and carefully select the most noble raw materials. Therefore, the tonic power is particularly strong and the effect is particularly great. The breadth of sales is setting new records every year. It is hoped that all sectors of industry and commerce will actively purchase them to achieve the effect of strengthening the body and assisting the Mengjin of their careers. In order to reward the kindness of new and old customers, Zhengwei Pharmacy will give away a baby towel or a dozen practice books for every two bottles purchased. The deadline is ten days, and there are not many days left, so don't miss it. For phone purchases, call 92525. The more you buy, the more you get.</p>
<p>Puppet Police Guard Panama Merchant Ship - Chinese Crew Members Detained - The Polly Dai, a Panama Ship, Has Been Moved to Yangshupu - The American Consul Will Protest in his Capacity as a Representative</p>
<p>The Polly Dai (transliteration), a Panama ship managed by the Norwegian firm Wah Loon Yoko, loaded with coal, arrived in Shanghai on the 26th of last month and docked at the Japanese Mitsui Wharf in Pudong to unload. On the morning of the day before yesterday (30th), a team of puppet police officers, accompanied by one Japanese and one Korean each, boarded the ship and arrested two Chinese crew members, detaining them at the Pudong puppet police station. It is learned that the two arrested men are originally from Hong Kong, and the reason for their arrest is falsely accused of anti-Japanese activities. A team of puppet police officers remained on the ship, intending to arrest a Chinese first mate when he returned to the ship. But as of this morning, there has been no confirmation as to whether the first mate has been arrested or whether the puppet police have withdrawn. However, the ship was moved to the Hey Fung Cotton Mill Wharf in Yangshupu in the morning. The shipowner reported the arrest of the two Chinese to the American Consulate in Shanghai, and the American consul is now considering filing a protest in his capacity as the representative of the Panamanian government in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Mitsui Agrees to Return Eggs Seized from American Merchants - Recently Seized Eggs Should Be Returned to Original Owners - Past Seizures Valued at 300,000 Yuan <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reports that, after the Mitsui company's seizure of eggs was exposed in the newspapers, the Mitsui company notified a certain American egg canning merchant this morning (31st) that the two batches of eggs seized from their company, totaling over 100 baskets, which are currently in the Mitsui company's warehouse on Huangpu Road, will be returned. However, the company must present the correct waybill and an appropriate guarantee. Based on other signs, the eggs purchased by British and American companies in the Yangtze River estuary, which have just been transported or will arrive in Shanghai within a day or two, should be delivered to the</p>
<p>Legitimate Original Owners</p>
<p>It is estimated that the eggs seized by Mitsui in recent weeks from seven British and American companies exceed 300,000 yuan. If Mitsui stops its egg seizure activities now, the factories of the seven companies that have been closed can resume operations immediately. These companies are now demanding that the eggs be returned to them in kind rather than receiving</p>
<p>Monetary Compensation</p>
<p>Of the 200 or so baskets of eggs that Mitsui has agreed to return to a certain American company, 20 baskets were seized last Saturday. As of this afternoon, there has been no news that they have been returned to the original owners, but it is expected that they will be returned today. The vast majority of eggs seized by Mitsui since October 10th have been</p>
<p>Broken and Sold</p>
<p>Therefore, British and American companies have no way to recover most of their lost eggs. At the same time, due to Mitsui's monopoly on the egg supply in the Yangtze River estuary, there is a shortage of eggs in the Shanghai public market. The few eggs that can be purchased are transported from Pudong and</p>
<p>Shanghai Suburbs</p>
<p>It is also learned that Mitsui does not use duck eggs for canning, so they are sold to small merchants for sale in the market. Although foreigners do not like duck eggs, the Chinese like to eat them.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the death of the martyr Huang Xing. All sectors of the city paid tribute to Huang Xing's great achievements in opposing imperial rule and founding the Republic, and especially his spirit of fearlessness in the face of danger, unyielding spirit, and hard struggle, which is worthy of emulation. However, no ceremonies were held. In addition, the central government stipulates that the death anniversaries of Deng Zhongyuan, Hu Zhantang, Chen Yingshi, Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin, and Huang Xing will all be commemorated on the Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Day on March 29 next year.</p>
<p>From Shanghai to the Interior - Route to Ningbo - Both Cost and Time are Extremely Economical</p>
<p>Recently, travelers heading to the interior mostly take the route through Haiphong, but the procedures for obtaining a passport are complicated, foreign exchange rates are high, and boat ticket prices have increased, making it even more difficult financially. Therefore, some also take the route through Guangzhou Bay and transfer to Yulin, but there are too many transfers and transportation is also inconvenient. According to inquiries, the following route from Shanghai</p>
<p>Is Economical in Terms of Time</p>
<p>Seems to be more economical (1) Take a sea ship from Shanghai to Zhenhai, which takes about 10 hours. (2) Take a small wheel from Zhenhai Port, pass through the blockade line, enter the Yong River, and reach Ningbo. The boat takes 3 hours. (3) Take a small wheel from Ningbo to Sanjiangkou (parked in the heart of the river) for about 2 hours, and wait for the barge to</p>
<p>Disembark on the Riverbank</p>
<p>It takes two and a half hours. (4) Take a sedan or rickshaw from Jiangkou to Xikou (sedan is more comfortable) for 3 hours. (5) Take a public bus from Xikou to Jinhua, which takes about 9 hours. Baggage is free for 20 kg. (6) After arriving in Jinhua, take the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway westward to Dongxiang Station in Jiangxi Province.</p>
<p>You Can Enter Hunan by Land Route</p>
<p>Also (7) After arriving in Jinhua, you can take a train to Lanxi and travel west along the highway to reach She County in Anhui, where transportation will become more convenient. The cost for the above (1) to (5) segments is only about 30 yuan (calculated according to the official cabin). The time is only about 30 hours.</p>

His wife did not suffer the same fate and quietly left Japan for Shanghai with her two children on the 29th of last month. According to Mrs. Decker, she still cannot say for sure whether her husband has been released or is still in the hands of the Japanese. It is said that the reason for Pastor Decker's arrest is that he distributed documents that disturbed peace and order and spread unfounded rumors in Kyoto.</p>

<p>The joint ordering of foreign rice by organizations in this city was completed yesterday. Regarding the proposal to establish grain storage, the rice industry also hopes that the authorities will adopt it. However, late rice is still being harvested in various places and will be completely harvested by the end of the tenth month of the lunar calendar. At that time, the source of rice and grain will inevitably increase. Although the authorities are considering it, it is expected that it may be implemented in half a month and that the financial sector will provide assistance to facilitate turnover.</p>

<p>National Defense Public Bonds and Gold Public Bonds of the Republic of China in 1938: (1) National Defense Public Bonds of 500 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, issued on May 1, 1938; (2) Gold Public Bonds, with an annual interest rate of 5%, issued on May 1, 1938, divided into customs gold notes of 100 million customs gold, English gold notes of 10 million pounds, and US gold notes of 50 million yuan. Both of the above two types of public bonds were scheduled to repay the principal and pay interest for the first time on October 31 of this year. They have been appropriated by the Ministry of Finance from designated tax revenue guarantees and handed over to the Central Bank, which has been credited to the accounts of the National Debt Fund Management Committee for the two public bonds. The Central Bank and its entrusted banks have been fully repaying the principal and paying interest since yesterday. It is learned that although the above public bonds have been solicited by the Ministry of Finance to various agencies, organizations, and overseas Chinese, the subscriptions have been very enthusiastic. However, due to the special circumstances in Shanghai and the lack of formal solicitation agencies, there are no paying banks in Shanghai for this first repayment of principal and payment of interest.</p>

<p>Recently, Japanese troop defenses in the North Jiangxi Road area have become stricter. In addition to dispatching armed Japanese soldiers for constant patrols, they are also conducting thorough inspections at the gaps leading to special zones. Any slight non-compliance results in detention, and pedestrians view passing through this area with dread. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, the number of Japanese soldiers at the Wenshi Road gap increased from two to three, and the strictness of the inspection was unprecedented. The area blocked by the Japanese with barbed wire has become extremely inconvenient to enter and exit because the traffic has been cut off by the barbed wire fence, so the business district is becoming increasingly desolate, and many residents are also moving away. According to investigations, there were originally 89 shops in this section, and 33 have now closed.</p>

<p>The British Navy in Shanghai has purchased two steamships. The "Saney," owned by the Shanghai Tug &amp; Lighter Co., was recently purchased by the British Naval Department in Shanghai for £20,000, equivalent to one million Chinese dollars. The transaction has already been completed. This ship was originally a rescue vessel, so its steel hull is very strong. It will soon sail to Hong Kong. Also, Moller &amp; Co.'s "Caroline Moller" is being purchased by the British Navy, and negotiations are currently underway. This ship was originally owned by the British Navy. Two years ago, Moller &amp; Co. purchased it in Singapore, and now the British Navy is buying it back.</p>
<h3 id="e81">The New Economic Atmosphere of "Free China" (Continued): By Bai Min, Translated from the "Millard's Review" <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The recent improvements in agriculture in the provinces of "Free China" have also shown good results. In most areas, government banks have provided credit loans to newly established rural cooperatives, or have implemented systematic seed improvements, which have greatly increased harvests. In the vast areas of Yunnan, grains have been planted to replace opium poppies. The province's opium production is the lowest this year in decades. The harvests of cotton, soybeans, tea, and sugarcane in "Free China" have all increased. Although farmers' vehicles are strictly prohibited from using the new highways, the new trucking business has opened up new markets and sources of supply for tens of thousands of villages that were isolated from the outside world just a year ago.</p>
<p>Of course, the arduous task of economic development in "Free China" still requires future efforts, but the great achievements of the past twelve months have undoubtedly enabled every village, city, and province in "Free China" to now have a new economic life and to move forward rapidly. Only a small portion of the areas in "Free China" have benefited from the new economic development so far. The economic activities of the people in most areas of the provinces have not yet been touched by the atmosphere of the new era, and life continues as it did in the past. Many villages remain unchanged, and hundreds of miles of new highways meander through undeveloped rural areas. The conservative residents of many county towns still stare blankly at the new full-range transportation between the provincial centers, and do not resolve to live according to the needs of the new situation and new circumstances.</p>
<p>However, the new economic development of "Free China" is a fact. Its progress has far exceeded the stage of a year ago, and it is no longer limited to the plans on paper formulated by the central government offices. This plan has been implemented in countless places, and is still spreading rapidly, gradually overcoming the resistance of past economic conservatism.</p>

<p>Around 2:45 PM yesterday, another shocking shooting blood case occurred in the Public Concession, resulting in one death and one serious injury. Here is what the news agency reporter learned about the situation:</p>
<p>Car Blocked, Driver Injured</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:15, two men in Chinese attire were riding in a black taxi, traveling from west to east, when they were passing the intersection of Avenue Road and Datong Road in the Public Concession, several men in short clothes suddenly jumped out from where they were ambushing, each reaching out to grab, shouting for the driver to stop, and ordering the people in the car to get out. At that time, the two men in the car thought they were police officers searching, so they got out of the car one after another to wait for the search. Unexpectedly, after the two men and the driver got out of the car, the men in short clothes next to them suddenly took out guns and shot the driver first, causing the driver to be hit by two bullets, one in the abdomen and one in the leg, falling down in front of No. 607 Avenue Road.</p>
<p>One Passenger Shot in the Chest</p>
<p>The two passengers who had gotten out of the car, standing next to the car, were greatly shocked when they saw this. One passenger immediately fled, while the other was about to shout when he was shot several times, immediately being hit by a bullet in the chest, injured and falling to the ground, in front of the doorway of No. 610 on the same road. The shooters, seeing that their goal had been achieved, jumped into the car with their accomplices and drove off on their own, speeding towards Carter Road, and disappeared in an instant. At that time, because pedestrians suddenly heard gunshots, they hid themselves, so no one noticed the license plate number of the car.</p>
<p>Driver Dies, Passenger Also in Danger</p>
<p>At that time, the nearby police officers also heard the alarm and arrived. Seeing the situation, they reported to the Xinzha Police Station, which immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene, and sent the dying driver and the passenger who was shot in the chest to the Shanghai Pass Road Public Works Bureau Hospital. However, the driver died soon after because of the injuries to vital parts of the body and excessive bleeding. The injured passenger is still being treated in the hospital, but it is said that his life is in extreme danger.</p>
<p>Injured Passenger Named Feng Gongzhan</p>
<p>After this bloody case occurred, the Public Concession Police immediately began investigating. It is learned that the passenger who was shot and seriously injured is named Feng Gongzhan, from Cixi, 36 years old, and is a high-ranking official of the puppet "Salt Bureau" in Zhejiang. The deceased was Jin Qichang, the driver of Wang Ruikai, the puppet "Governor of Zhejiang Province." This time, they had just come to Shanghai from Zhejiang a few days ago. Yesterday, Feng said that his friend Wu, who fled when the shooting occurred, is currently a senior official in the puppet "Jiangsu Provincial Government Office," and planned to return to Hangzhou in the original car. The car's direction on Avenue Road from west to east was towards the North Railway Station.</p>
<p>Huge Sum of 100,000 Yuan Gone with the Car</p>
<p>When Feng and others planned to return to Zhejiang by car, they had a small leather suitcase with them, containing 100,000 yuan in cash. When they went out, the suitcase was in the car. Whether the men in short clothes were lying in ambush to rob the huge sum of money is currently under strict investigation by the police. However, as of the time of publication, there has been no news of the car being found.</p>

<p>Liu Shaokui, Chief Chinese Detective of the Public Concession Police, and Detective Yang Xiguang, learned yesterday that bandits would pass by the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road, so they waited there and successfully apprehended Gu Youchun, a man from Haimen, and took him to the police station. After questioning, he confessed that there were firearms hidden at No. 39, Lane 80, Gaoun Road in the French Concession, so they went to search and confiscate them. They confiscated one handgun, nine bullets, one lotus pistol, twenty-eight bullets, and eighty-nine Mauser rifle bullets. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court of the Special No. 1 Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted them temporarily according to the Public Danger Law and requested permission to change the date because further detailed investigation was still needed. Gu Youchun confessed that these firearms were picked up by the river in Nanxiang. Although he tried to sell them, he never actually did it. After Judge Xiao Biancai verified the confession, he ordered the postponement and rescheduling of the hearing for one week.</p>
<h3 id="e84">French Lawyer Dahan Sues for Legal Fees: One-Sided Debate Concluded, Four Defendants Do Not Acknowledge, Re-Hearing Requested to Revoke Original Verdict <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Five lumber firms in the Nanshi area, Yikang, Zhenchang, Changyuan, Kaitai, and others, successively moved to the Baisezhong Road and Zhao Bishop Road area in the western district of the French Concession, renting vacant land to pile up timber and use as business premises. Around the spring and summer of last year, the French Public Works Bureau sent a letter to each lumber firm stating that the vacant land could only be used for building houses and not for stacking wood, and that they would be required to move out after a certain period. Therefore, the managers or owners of each lumber firm jointly engaged French lawyer Dahan to represent them in writing to the French Public Works Bureau, requesting exemption from moving. A contract was immediately signed. Later, lawyer Dahan sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau requesting a result. Due to the limitations of the regulations, the request was not approved, and each firm had to move out. Subsequently, lawyer Dahan urged the client lumber firms to pay the legal fees. Each of the five lumber firms paid 60 yuan, totaling 300 yuan, to Dahan, obtained receipts, and retrieved the contracts. Each firm thought the matter was over. Unexpectedly, lawyer Dahan believed that the legal fees at that time should have been 300 yuan per firm, but only 60 yuan per firm had been collected, leaving a total of 1,200 yuan. He sent letters to each lumber firm to urge payment, but to no avail. Lawyer Dahan then submitted a complaint to the Civil Court of the Special No. 2 Court, requesting public service for the lumber firms that could not be found. The court, according to the complaint, carried out the public service in accordance with the law. As a result, none of the five lumber firms appeared in court, and it was ruled that each of the lumber firms should pay the legal fees in full. The case went through a final judgement before being transferred for execution. Each lumber firm then learned that they were being sued for legal fees. Therefore, Zhang Yongde of Yikang Lumber Firm, Ma Chunrong of Zhenchang Lumber Firm, Zhang Chunbao of Changyuan Lumber Firm, and Zhang Shiyi of Kaitai Lumber Firm, entrusted lawyer Wu Leping and others to act as agents and submitted evidence and reasons, filing a complaint with the Civil Court of the Special No. 2 Court against lawyer Dahan.</p>
<p>Based on the complaint, the court, presided over by Judge Li Liang, held a hearing in the seventh courtroom yesterday morning. Both parties were represented by lawyers. According to the lawyer representing the plaintiff in the retrial, each of the retrial plaintiffs had addresses and could be found in the telephone directory, so they could not be said to be untraceable. Moreover, the legal fees were originally set at 300 yuan, which had been paid in full. The retrieved contracts and receipts were presented to the court, requesting the original verdict to be revoked and an appropriate verdict to be made. The defendant, represented by lawyer Zhou Liangfu, submitted the location written by the client at the time and the return receipt of the reminder letter as evidence, and stated that the legal fees were agreed upon as 300 yuan per firm at that time. The number of legal fees was not specified in the contract, resulting in the receipt clearly stating that 300 yuan was received. It should be requested that the retrial appeal be rejected. After reviewing the above statements, it was announced that the debate was over, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced on November 4.</p>

<p>Lin Yuxiao, a traditional Chinese medicine doctor, used to live in Nanshi. After the war, he took refuge at No. 12 Pingwang Street in the concession, and still practiced medicine to make a living. On July 15 of this year, Lin suddenly received a letter, falsely claiming to be Chen Yi, the commander of the Sixth Detachment of the Fifth Column of the Jiangzhe Border Guerrilla Force. The letter was in the form of an official letter, complete with seals. The letter also included a bullet, and the words in the letter roughly stated that the unit lacked military pay, and appealed to the spirit of the people to contribute money or effort, and asked for appropriate assistance. Lin ignored it. He was then asked to meet at the Xiang Sheng Gambling Hall in Caojiadu. Lin did not go as agreed. Until 11:00 AM on the 28th of the month, Fu Fuchu, a 66-year-old man from Hangzhou, suddenly held a letter to Lin Yuqing, and after Lin asked, it turned out to be a third letter of intimidation. At that time, he also said that no matter what, a considerable amount of money must be paid, otherwise he would never give up. Lin then pretended to be cooperative and reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station by telephone. Detective Xue Youwen and Detective Sun Dafa rushed to the scene, arrested the suspect, and took him to the police station. After interrogation, he confessed that the delivery of the letter this time was entrusted by Wang Guoying from Hangzhou. The detectives then went to the Fu Long Tea House at No. 218 Zhejiang Road and arrested Wang, bringing him back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special No. 1 Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process, stating that the case still needed to be investigated and the notes needed to be verified, so he requested that the two defendants be temporarily detained pending investigation before prosecution. After Judge Feng Shide questioned the two defendants briefly, he ordered them to be returned to custody and the hearing rescheduled.</p>

<p>Thieves Apprehended, Confess to Intimidation</p>
<p>Chen Xiangming, the manager of the Daming Match Factory office at No. 15, Lane 771, Niuzhuang Road, received a threatening letter by post on the 6th of this month, bearing the name Wang Ying, the leader of the Soviet-Zhejiang Border Guerrilla, demanding 3,000 yuan. As a result of negotiations, the matter was settled for 120 yuan. Unexpectedly, at 8:00 AM on the 13th, four thieves, armed with handguns, went to the office, robbed 1,800 yuan worth of money and goods, and fled with a shout. Until about 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, Xu Decheng, a Chinese detective from the Yideng Road Police Station, apprehended Shen Genxiang, a suspect from Longhua, and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special No. 1 Court. When questioned, the defendant confessed to writing a threatening letter to demand money, but said he had nothing to do with the robbery of the Daming Match Factory on Niuzhuang Road, and asked for mercy. Judge Huang Risheng ordered that he still be detained and the hearing rescheduled.</p>
<p>Boatman Drunk, Pushes Wife into River</p>
<p>Lu Heshang, a boatman from Suzhou, was mooring his boat No. 3437 at the Zhaopu Road Bridge in Suzhou Creek. At 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, Lu Heshang drank too much alcohol, resulting in being very drunk. He was pushed into the river by his wife, Lu Xiaomei. Fortunately, Lu Xiaomei was rescued and spared from disaster, while Lu was arrested and sent to the Special No. 1 Court for prosecution. According to Lu Heshang, he was really drunk at the time and inadvertently pushed his wife into the river, and did not intend to harm his wife. Lu Xiaomei also defended her husband, saying that her husband did not intentionally push her into the river and expressed her unwillingness to pursue the matter. As a result of the court hearing, Lu Heshang was found not guilty.</p>
<p>Quadrangle Love Affair, Murderer's Trial Concluded</p>
<p>At 5:30 PM on the 23rd of this month, a case of a quadrangle love affair occurred on Yulin Road, where a concubine killed Yangzhou woman Wang Xiuying. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Peishen sat in the Second Criminal Court to continue the trial. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted Du Defa and Liu Linfu for the crime of joint murder under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and stated the details of the case, saying that the purchase of the bayonet and the discussion at the Fuyuan Tea House were both witnessed by the two defendants, which had been investigated and confirmed by the detectives. Then the landlady of the two-story building, Mrs. Kong Xu, complained that when she heard it and went upstairs to check, the defendant Du Defa closed the door and refused to let her in. Du Defa still denied the murder, while Liu Linfu confessed that he committed the murder at Du's request and admitted to the murder without hesitation, and hired lawyer Huang Huancheng to defend him. The court ordered the two defendants to be detained pending sentencing next Tuesday morning.</p>

<h3 id="e92">New Life Women's Handicraft Society Exhibition and Sale <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>A New Dream</p>
<p>Starting from the 3rd, a four-day exhibition and sale will be held at the society's location. Major companies and manufacturers are cooperating to provide convenience.</p>
<p>The Chinese Christian Women's Temperance Association is an international women's organization with considerable achievements in various women's affairs. Before the war, Liu Wang Liming, currently in the women's circle, was the backbone of the association. After the war, the association's location was moved from Yue Ming Yuan Road to No. 80 Xieqiao Lane on Jing'an Temple Road. Due to the assassination of Dr. Liu Zhan'en, Liu Wang Liming went to Hong Kong. However, the Women's Temperance Association did not slacken in its work in various departments; on the contrary, it is actively promoting them.</p>
<p>Currently, in addition to running the New Life Women's Senior Vocational School, middle school, and supplementary classes, the Women's Temperance Association is particularly eager to point out the New Life Women's Handicraft Society. This handicraft society was specifically established for women who fled from the war. Although it has not been around for long, its achievements are already quite good. The main goal is to train refugee women so that they have a skill in handicrafts, allowing them to be self-sufficient and not rely on long-term relief. In a very short period, hundreds of refugee women have received training from the society and have gained a skill, currently making a living through handicrafts. Benefiting refugees is indeed no small feat!</p>
<p>This war has caused female compatriots to be displaced. It is unknown how many are finding it difficult to find work in the "isolated island" and are living in hardship. Therefore, it is imperative that the Women's Temperance Association, in collaboration with the business community, establish the New Life Women's Handicraft Class to provide work for refugee women so they can live. This is also something that women's organizations wish to hold. Recently, it was decided to hold a four-day product exhibition and sale at No. 80 Xieqiao Lane on November 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th, with the aim of arousing sympathy and attention from people in society so that they can enthusiastically purchase the society's products and prevent problems in the lives of hundreds of refugee women.</p>
<p>I remember that the New Life Women's Handicraft Society also held an exhibition and sale last year. Not long ago, when the retail department of the Refugee Production and Consumption Cooperative opened at No. 850 Lafayette Road, the New Life Women's Handicraft Society also participated with its products. Generally speaking, the society's products are not only comparable to those made by factories, but also cheaper than ordinary companies and businesses.</p>
<p>This time, most of the products on display are handmade crafts by refugee women, including children's clothing, embroidery, woolen knitwear, paper flowers, toys, clothing, blankets, chair cushions, etc., covering a wide range of categories. In a nutshell, they are all children's products and household sundries. In addition to the exhibition and sale, the Women's Temperance Association is also vigorously promoting the sale of vouchers to the outside world. The four major companies on Nanjing Road, the National Goods Company, and the China Chemical Society have all agreed to provide support and cooperation. Although the exhibition and sale only lasts for four days, after the closing, the products will still be displayed at No. 80 Xieqiao Road for long-term sale. It is hoped that people in society can show great sympathy for a group of refugee women and enthusiastically purchase the society's products, which would also be a great act of kindness!</p>
<p>No Marriage Allowed</p>
<p>When the post office recently recruited junior postal workers, it was said that according to the order of the Postal Administration, only men were allowed to register for the examination, and even female postal assistants in the bureau were not allowed to apply. The reason given was that women are physically weak and inconvenient to dispatch. However, this "consideration" has not been agreed upon by the women's community. On the contrary, they have cited considerable counter-evidence: "Among the personnel recruited in the last examination, the proportion of women who should be transferred to serve in the Southwest was higher than that of men." (See "A Letter from the Shanghai Women's Community to Women Nationwide") It can be seen that the real reason for not accepting women is not this. The real reason, which Europe and America have not yet seen, is the four measures stipulated for restricting the recruitment of female staff in Sichuan. From the third and fourth of these four measures, which state that married women are not allowed to apply and that those who marry after joining the bureau will be dismissed upon their impending marriage, it can at least be guessed that one of the reasons is not allowing marriage.</p>
<p>I remember that our "humorist" once said a famous saying about the art of deception: "The best career for a woman is marriage." Now, the post office's approach is precisely an interpretation of this humorous saying. At present, we cannot deny that there are still some women who only know how to rely on others for a comfortable life. However, looking further afield, in every corner of China, Chinese women have stood up firmly and are participating in any activity and work. If the "humorist's" words were satirizing a certain group of women, then the post office's no-marriage theory is an overly literal interpretation.</p>
<p>Naturally, these are private speculations. During the nationwide war of resistance, even for those backward women, we cannot use humorous satire to make them sink forever. We should make them aware and awaken them. As the "Letter from the Shanghai Women's Community to Women Nationwide" says very clearly: "In recent years, with the rise of the War of Resistance, the country is at a critical juncture. The only way to win is to gather the strength of the nation to serve the country. Our supreme leader has repeatedly warned the people to mobilize all manpower and material resources nationwide to strive for the final victory. Women are also members of the nation, and it is their responsibility to contribute to the country to the best of their ability, and they must not give up their sacred duty." Therefore, we hope that there is a sufficient reason for not recruiting women and for the four measures stipulated for restricting the recruitment of female staff, and that it can be explained or immediately withdrawn.</p>

<p>Chapter 17 of Bao Tianxiao's work</p>
<p>Learning External Affairs, Reporters Enter a New Field</p>
<p>Practicing Internal Affairs, Small Training Grounds in School</p>
<p>When someone first recommended Miss Shao Huihua to that newspaper, they thought it was a young lady going to work in external affairs. There were many women working there. They tried her out and assigned her a few easy interviews, mostly about women. However, she was able to handle them happily. Later, they gradually assigned her more difficult tasks, and the gentlemen in the editorial department were very satisfied with her. You should know that investigating news is not a fixed thing; it all depends on the agility of your own mind. As the ancients said, "You can give people rules, but you cannot give them skill." All learning is like this. It's like journalism gives you a main road, but what if the main road is impassable? Can't you find another way? Think about how big the world is, space and time, filling the sky and the earth, are all news, as long as you go find it yourself. Those who are good at finding news only need to sniff in the air to know that there is news there. This is called a "news nose." People with a news nose know where the news is as soon as they sniff. People without a news nose can't smell any news in the air, even if there is good news. Like Miss Shao Huihua, she was born with a news nose. Not only that, but the first thing a journalist needs is to have their own interest. With interest, they don't care about anything, they have a spirit of adventure, and they have a will to endure hardship. If there is something better and more comfortable than being a journalist, and you ask them to do it, they would rather give it up and be willing to do the hard work. Why is this? Because they have that interest, which occupies their loyalty. Although someone is a journalist, the first thing is to have talent, the second is to have cultivation, and the third is to have interest. These three are almost indispensable. First, in terms of talent, it is the person with a news nose that I mentioned above. To some extent, they have a talent for journalism. Otherwise, the same thing happens, and the same people come. Why don't people feel anything, while people with journalistic talent smell the breath of news inside? It's the same with going to interview an important person, and listening to a speech from this important person. Why do people often not hear what he means, what he means outside of what he says, but once a talented journalist hears it, he feels understanding, connects everything, and can uncover his unspoken secrets?</p>

<p>Life Report</p>
<p>A Group Soaked in Copper Dust</p>
<p>Fu Huan</p>
<p>——Words of a Copper Grinding Worker——</p>
<p>Under the sparse moonlight of the autumn night, I was talking to a copper grinding apprentice about his life and background. I stared at his pale face with a bitter smile. I didn't want to smell the fragrance of Liangxiang (?) chestnuts in the night wind, but I didn't ignore every trembling and heavy word that came out of his ashen lips...</p>
<p>You ask me how old I was when I came here? Sigh! You might not believe it when I tell you; I came here as an apprentice at the age of seven. Now I am eighteen years old, and I have been working here for a full ten years, but I have not yet been promoted to clerk, and I am still an apprentice.</p>
<p>The apprentices here, except for me, all have contracts, some for five years, some for six years, because they are sent here by their parents to learn. However, I was bought by my boss with money. So I don't know when I can jump out of this "apprentice" shackle?!</p>
<p>In the first few years, of course, I did chores, wiping copperware and some small and simple tasks. It was still good at that time, because wiping copperware was not done in the workshop (machine room), but in the back patio or outside the door, so my body was much stronger than it is now. Around the age of ten, I started doing copper grinding work. Every day I held moldy black copperware on the machine and rubbed it, letting copper dust enter my nostrils, mouth, throat, eyes... The copper dust sucked away my essence and blood, and I became thinner and thinner day by day. —Speaking of this, his voice became even more serious. He glanced at me, bared his chest. His thin, yellow, and dry chest, you could almost count every one of his twenty-four ribs.</p>
<p>We now have to do sixteen hours of work every day. Apart from eating and sleeping, the rest of the time is spent making copper dust to erode our bodies. Although our work is hard enough, our treatment is really pitifully meager; the highest wage here is Lao Fa's. Indeed, Lao Fa does some work very well, both skillfully and quickly. However, he only gets ten old silver dollars a month. Now I also get three yuan a month. When I first came here, I wasn't qualified to get wages. I only got two dimes in subsidies for haircuts, bathing, pocket money... all from these two dimes. But now I finally have three yuan!</p>
<p>He looked up at the moon covered in black纱, The night was deep. The two cat stars shone their eyes towards the slant west crescent moon; the streets were as silent as dead. He bid me farewell, yawning, and swayed his tired body, hobbled into the door.</p>

<p>Active Entertainment World in Kunming</p>
<p>Huaisheng</p>
<p>Kunming is located at the intersection of the two major international routes, Yunnan-Burma and Yunnan-Vietnam, making it a transportation hub in the southwest rear area, second only to the temporary capital of Chongqing. Therefore, the population is increasing, the city is prosperous, and the entertainment industry is also experiencing unprecedented development.</p>
<p>Movies</p>
<p>There are currently two cinemas in Kunming, one named "Dazhong" and the other "Yile." "Dazhong" is luxurious in content, with brilliant lights and complete equipment, and seat prices are also expensive, reaching more than one yuan. The films screened are all imported; both Hollywood and Soviet productions are available. Although "Yile" is relatively ordinary, the seat prices are also around one yuan. The films screened are mainly domestic, and films such as "Hua Mulan" and "Diao Chan" have had good success here.</p>
<p>Theaters</p>
<p>There are also only two theaters, one is the "Xin Dian Stage," located at the old site of the Huguang Guild Hall, which specializes in Yunnan opera. Most of the audience are locals. The equipment is simple, and the seat prices are also relatively cheap, between five and six cents. This kind of local opera is generally evolved from Peking opera, so the tones, styles, scripts, and plots are all very similar to Peking opera, and there are also performances by both men and women. The other is the "Xin Sheng Stage," located in Jinbi Park. The equipment is slightly more elaborate than that of the "Xin Dian," and the seat prices are more than one yuan. The theater does not have a fixed basic opera troupe; they come and go and are of a mobile nature. Zhao Ruquan and Huang Yulin have both performed here, and their performances were not bad, especially Zhao Ruquan, who made a very good impression on the people of Kunming.</p>
<p>Drama</p>
<p>The drama movement in Kunming is very developed, and new drama troupes are springing up like mushrooms after rain, with more than a dozen. In terms of nature, those belonging to the student world include the "Yun Da," "Tong Ji," "Lian Da," and the "Dapeng Drama Society" of the Aviation School; those in the youth world include the "Youth Association Drama Troupe"; those in the children's world include the "Children's Drama Troupe"; and those in the primary school teachers and other professional circles include the "Amateur Drama Society." Many plays have been performed in the past two years, including existing ones such as "Sunrise" and "Thunderstorm," and newly written ones such as "Huangpu Moon" and "Flying General," no less than seventy or eighty kinds. Recently, the "National Defense Drama Society" performed Cao Yu's "Wilderness," one of his three major works, at the "Xin Dian," with Cao Yu himself directing. The stage supervisor was Sun Yutang, and the designs were by Wen Yiduo and Lei Guiyuan, all famous figures in the theater world. The cast of actors was complete, and the scenery was particularly magnificent. Therefore, when the play advertisements were posted, although the seat prices were as high as more than two yuan, people still rushed to reserve seats, one after another. The ticket revenue reached more than 10,000 yuan, which can be called a grand event in the Kunming theater world.</p>
<p>Singing and Dancing</p>
<p>The "Wuhan Chorus" and the singing class of the "Ministry of Education Drama Group" led by Chen Dabei successively came here and sowed the seeds of singing. Therefore, now in the streets of Kunming, and even in the corners of the suburbs, you can hear tragic and慷慨 songs. In addition, the strong men of the Miao and Yao ethnic groups trained in the Taoist school, dancing is their masterpiece. Every time there is a comfort and celebration meeting, they have dance performances. Sometimes they march in torchlight processions, singing and dancing, like a raging fire, and the situation is particularly enthusiastic.</p>
<p>In General: The various departments of Kunming's entertainment world are full of vitality and are growing in an active atmosphere.</p>
<p>The True Face of Sai Jinhua in Lushan</p>
<p>Huanlan</p>
<p>The Xuan Gong Theater once performed "Sai Jinhua," which was very popular for a while. According to reports, Sai Jinhua's original name was Zhao Lingfei, and she was from Suzhou, born in the tenth year of Tongzhi. When the "Shen Bao" was founded, she was only one year old. Her life story has been full of changes, which can be described as both lamentable and inspiring. She fell into prostitution in her youth, and as she grew up, she became the wife of an envoy in one leap. After that, she re-entered the red light district and became a冯妇, and married again and again. In her later years, she was displaced and died of illness in a broken house. Yang Yunshi briefly recorded her life story on her tomb, especially the activities of Sai during the entry of the Allied Forces into Beijing, which is described in great detail. His words say, "At the beginning, the Allied Forces took Germany as the head of the Allied Forces because the Boxer Rebellion killed the German Minister Klinkhardt, and appointed Waldersee as the commander of the Eight-Power Allied Forces. Germany, in order to avenge its resentment, ravaged the residents, and the concubines and daughters of officials and gentry committed suicide by throwing themselves into wells and hanging themselves. Later, the Ministry of Rites奏旌節烈者四百餘擋. Lingfei was intimate with Waldersee, and several times spoke to Waldersee in between, so that the troops under the command of the East strictly prohibited淫戮, released those involved, and rescued the people from their difficulties, and Waldersee immediately acted." At that time, Waldersee lived in the Yiluan Palace, and Sai Jinhua could enter and exit without restriction. Liang Qichao also wrote a poem to praise this: "联欢必竟赖此花，售意输情本惯家，银总拥出仪鸾殿，争认娉婷赛二爷." It can be seen that Sai once saved the people from fire and water in those years, and cannot be regarded as an ordinary 平康. However, times are different. According to today's situation, Sai's shameless service to the enemy is a crime against the nation! The attached photo is of her in her youth. The clothes she wears are not beautiful in the eyes of modern people, but they were the most fashionable clothes at that time.</p>
<p>Anecdotes from Paradise</p>
<p>The Strange Cases of Killing a Son for Revenge and Killing a Father</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the accomplices and informants in the two cases. In the "Killing a Son for Revenge" case, Xu forced her daughter to help her commit this inhuman act. The sister, seeing her brother being killed, was shocked and distraught. Holding her beloved brother's hand and foot, she stroked them with her hand and cried non-stop until her mother shouted loudly, and then she threw the them into the jar. Although her mother killed her son due to a temporary lustful impulse, she may have regretted it after the killing. Therefore, she gasped aside, unable to bear to look, but ordered her daughter to pack up the body. However, the case of Zhou Yongjie being murdered by his two sons is quite different from this. The brothers colluded beforehand, and can only be said to be brothers in distress, with no distinction between principal and accessory. After the incident, there was no sorrow or repentance, and their attitude was calm, like a scientist dissecting and experimenting. It is easy to commit this murderous act by closing your eyes and clenching your teeth, but sawing apart requires watching slowly. It is unbearable to do this to a chicken or dog, let alone use this method to deal with a direct relative? The viciousness of the minds of Qin Ji and Qin Xiang is also evident. If these kinds of people are allowed to stand in society, the future disasters will be unimaginable. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Secondly, let's describe the informants in these two cases. After Guan Bao died, his tutor, Mr. Wang, pleaded his case in court on his behalf. In the past, teachers were respected, so it was often said that teachers and students were like father and son. In the feudal era, if a father sent his son to be an official, the teacher could lead him out. Conversely, if a student violated school rules, the teacher could punish him severely and even send him to the government, then the student's father could not lead him out. After Guan Bao's father died, the child relied on the teacher as if he were a strict father. The teacher saw that he did not come to school the next day, and compared it with Guan Bao's last words of farewell the day before. Then, he righteously pleaded his case, captured the evil monk and adulterous woman, and avenged his disciple's strange wrong.</p>

<p>What You Need to Know</p>
<p>All Kinds of Things About the Dahua Grand Theater</p>
<p>Meng He</p>
<p>This journal has reported on the Dahua Grand Theater many times. Recently, I heard all kinds of news from relevant parties, many of which are unknown to the outside world. It seems necessary to describe them in detail. Now, I will describe them in detail as follows:</p>
<p>Opening Date</p>
<p>This is the biggest mystery and what outsiders are waiting to "solve." In fact, the most uncertain thing is the opening date, because the construction project is being rushed day and night, and it is hard to guarantee that there will be no obstacles. The final decision of the authorities is that it will probably be able to meet the ladies of Shanghai around November 20. It is said that the day before the premiere, they plan to invite relevant parties to make a pilgrimage for a visit.</p>
<p>Selected Films</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact that MGM films are selected.</p>
<p>Insects on the Silver Screen</p>
<p>Qu</p>
<p>In the world, no matter what, as long as you put in the effort, there is nothing that cannot be used. Now let me report a little bit of new hope news. Hollywood, which holds the bull of the film industry, has recruited all kinds of actors. In addition to human movie stars, there are also animal movie stars, who also have generous salaries. Now it's even weirder! Insects can also be on the silver screen. It turns out like this: There is a famous actor in Hollywood named Syd Fogel. He can be original and train flies, spiders, beetles, and all kinds of lice to be actors in movies. A drop of syrup can bring his actors together, and weak traces of food can lure them to walk, run, or fly to a destination. Fogel has studied the habits of various insects very well and uses them to play appropriate roles on the silver screen. These acting insects are placed on straps made of fine hair and must be hidden before filming. The insects trained by Korgel need to be very complex, so his work is also very busy.</p>
<p>The company has made full preparations in advance and has more than twenty premiere blockbusters in storage. Like the diva McDonald's "Singing Lovers 1," Weissmuller's "Tarzan Gets a Son," Robert Donat's "A Thousand Years of Teachers," Joan Crawford, "Mitsui Silver Flower," Norma Shearer's "Woman," and Michael's first blockbuster "Full House of Gold" have all been previewed in Shanghai. The five-color fairy tale blockbuster "Wizard of Oz," worth four million gold, has also arrived in Shanghai and will be promoted and mobilized to movie fans throughout Shanghai.</p>
<p>Other special features of the entire theater include: Inside the lobby, there is another rest room, which looks like a suite and has a separate world. The large number of emergency exits provides guests with a lot of convenience. The harmonious color scheme of the entire theater is full of a warm atmosphere. The equipment for air conditioning and heating is, needless to say, the latest model of machinery this year. The most amazing equipment is air conditioning, which can completely exhaust the turbid air of a large theater in an extremely short time of two minutes and transport all the fresh air, so that the body and mind of the audience can get considerable benefits.</p>
<p>What I can report now is all here. In the future, I will report to readers as soon as possible.</p>
