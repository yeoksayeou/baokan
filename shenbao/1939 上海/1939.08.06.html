<p>社評</p>
<h3>勗投考國立院校的靑年</h3>
<p>本年度國立各院校統一招生，將於明天起全國分十五區同時舉行；上海不過是十五區之一，報名應考的人數却已有好幾千了。這許多投考的靑年，有些家庭原在上海，有些家在各淪陷區域裏，都是特地來到上海應試。此决統一招生的院校共計二十三校，在上海的不過四校半（交通大學的唐山工學院不在上海）、原在內地或由上海及其他淪陷城市遷往內地的居十八校半；而且留在上海的，獨立學院多，完全大學少，比較規模小，容納人數不多，內地的却反是；所以就事實上說、這許多應試的靑年、不但對國立學校具有深切的信仰，而且大部分都是準備着到內地去求學的。這些靑年不滿足於自己的知識技能，有志深造，允其在現在上海到內地交通極不方便的時候，他們却不怕關山的阻越，路途的艱險，願意背鄉離井，萬里負笈，這種熱誠爲學的精神，何等値得欽佩！然而我們單把這樣的觀點來稱道這些熱誠的靑年，還未免太淺見，太平凡，太不夠了解他們眞實的意向。試問今日何日？此地何地？上海和各淪陷區域的居民，誰不自悲其境遇的惡劣？誰願更變其效忠本國本族的初衷？又誰不願覓得適當的機會，貢獻其身心？靑年的感覺最敏銳，目光最遠大，他們爲什麼願往內地去？無非因爲在內地可以呼吸自由的空氣，可以追求光明的前途。所以與其說他們的投考祇爲了志切求學，毋甯說他們決心要脫離惡濁的氛圍，投入光明的懷抱。至於他們的家長，甯願犧牲了膝下承歡的美夢，聽他們的子弟前往內地覓取光明的前途，同時又表示了自己的赤忱，把國家民族最感需要的人力輸送到內地去，這比獻金捐輪等任何物質的貢獻，意義更不知偉大到多少倍。因此我們看了上海區應考學生這樣的踴躍，不禁爲中國前途慶幸。同時對於有志的靑年和賢明的家長，都表示無限的敬意！</p>
<p>國立各院校統一招生，由敎育部綜司其事，取錄人數，政府自有權衡，而且在事先一定有很周密的計劃，不煩我們多所論議，但是根據着上海區的需要，我們覺得如果事實允許，最好請主持者略爲增加上海區的錄取名額。爲什麼有這種需要呢？第一個理由因爲上海有着特殊的環境。前面已經說過，上海區投考的靑年大多是不滿意於現實環境而擬向內地尋求光明的人，那末國家正應該充分給與他們滿足欲望的機會。而况上海及其附近地區，不論經濟文化等各方面，向來是全國首要的區域，在這區域裏的靑年素質上根本是優秀的，而目前淪陷地區日僞方面所施行的奴化敎育，以及上海特殊區域裏宵小奸宄對於文化敎育的覬觎，莫不把這些俊秀靑年作爲吸收的對象。雖然我們堅決地相信靑年們決不甘受麻醉，也決不會不辨黑白，但是爲了保存國族元氣，維護優秀力量，抵禦黑暗勢力起見，很有把上海一帶的靑年大量輸入內地的必要。第二個理由，因爲上海招考區所包括的地域實在太廣大了。這次十五個招生區中，川省居其二，陝甘豫鄂湘贛浙閩粤桂滇黔各居其一，而上海也居其一。上海在表面上雖僅係十五區之一，然而在事實上，目前的上海却已成爲沿海沿江以及其他大部分淪陷地域交通的總樞紐，也就是從淪陷區域轉入內地的總門戶。所以上海招考區所包括的地域實在比任何其他一區都廣大得多，因此投考的人數必然的也很多，從數量比例上說起來，錄取名額也應該比其他報考區增加一點</p>
<p>然而即使錄取名額果然增加一點，但是事實上能夠錄取的人當然還居少數。被錄取的靑年，必然能夠發展自己的懷抱爲抗戰建國的後方事業上增加偉大的力量；那其餘多數未被錄取的，心理上也許會感到無限的悵惘。但是我們認爲他們的遭遇雖不幸，却也儘可不必懊喪。因爲自從上海形成孤島以來，靑年們固然大聲疾呼地要到內地去，然而留在上海的，却也並不是絕無意義。他們當然不必抱什麼養晦待時的消極態度，也不必過什麼隨波浮沉的放任生活，因爲在事實上儘有許多重要的工作，需要靑年們積極地去幹。只要靑年們能夠運用堅貞不拔的精神，站在各自的崗位上努力，效忠國家民族的赤忱便和到內地去並無軒輊，工作上能夠開闢的園地也可以說俯拾即是。况當目前這樣黑暗籠罩的孤島社會裏，正需要淸白純潔的靑年來做社會的核心，所謂「松柏後凋於歲寒，雞鳴不已於風雨」顧亭林先生的名言，正可以移贈有心無力到內地去的靑年。</p>
<h3>英美法會同努力　穩定中國法幣　摩根韜在英進行接洽　美政府準備對華放款</h3>
<p>（倫敦）美國財政部長摩根韜卽當到達此問、此行雖係非正式性質、但當乘機就英美兩國在中國所處地位、尤其是中國法幣穩定問題、與英國財政部代表進行談話、査英法兩國近曾與美國政府接洽、擬由英法美三國會同努力穩定中國法幣、並請美國撥出款項、以充實平準基金、美國政府聞曾答稱、願與英法兩國作平行舉動、但不擬同時有作爲、厥後閱時無幾、美政府卽宣告廢止美日商的、于以見美國之平行舉動、業已見諸實際矣、關於天津租界中國存銀問題、張伯倫業已決定未可由英日兩國予以解決、務須徵詢美法兩國政府意見、東京談判或因此而暫時停頓、正未可必、關於此層、英國對於日本之復文、大體上當視歐洲暨遠東一般局勢如何發展以爲斷、允其是當視日本是否加入德義兩國軍事同盟條的以爲斷、關於日本加入德義兩國軍事同盟條的問題、倫敦方面尙未接獲何項消息、足資徵信、此事若果屬實、則英國卽當認爲須以比較强硬的態度、對付日本、摩根韜財長亦當與英國政府經濟顧問李滋羅斯爵士擬定援助中國辦法、殆有可斷言、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）中國金融經濟狀况、頃由接近國務院人士加以評論、均謂此其性質極爲微妙、緣日本正擬在經濟上設法使中國淪陷區復興、以爲久據之計、並在各該區强制行使新貨幣、作爲買賣之唯一媒介、此在外國商人旣拒不承認此種貨幣、亦卽在淪陷區內無從經營商業、因此之故、美國利益直接感受其威脅、政府已向日本政府提出强硬抗議、同時賡續收購中國白銀、並以信用放款給予中國、一俟國會休會之後政府當再度有所發動俾以美國在遠東保衛利益之決心、昭示日本云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>義國各報並無熱烈火反應</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於日本駐義大使白鳥敏夫、駐德大使大島將軍聯名電請東京政府加入德義兩國軍事同盟一項消息、倫教泰晤士報頃載有駐雜馬訪員來電稱、義國各報並無熱烈反應、此乃最可驚異之事、各種事件、凡眞爲法西斯政府所欣喜者、義國各報無不舖張揚厲、加以渲染、此决之事、乃無一言及之、自非一般人始料所及、查日本加入德義軍事同盟之議、乃係德義兩國在數月前所提出、茲該國若要求實行加入、德義兩國自未便予以拒絕、惟自彼時以至此際、情勢已大有變遷、本年初間日本對於歐洲糾紛、原無多大牽連、德義兩國深望日本與英法兩國發生料紛、、俾各該國之海軍一部份、爲遠東事件所牽制、時至此日、日本雖未與柏林羅馬軸心簽訂軍事同盟條的、却已自行樹敵、德義兩國欲在遠東牽制英法兩國、亦已如願以償、不難儘量加以利用、英日兩國之問、若果發生戰事、則德義兩國在歐洲所處局勢、旣較易應付、而各該國之外交、亦隨之而較爲有力、又安有求援於日本之必要、反之、各該國若果成爲日本之同盟國、或須於時機不順時、與英國作戰、自非計之得者、準此而論、德義日三國軍事同盟條的若果見　事實、亦必　隙甚多、從而以相當保障給予德義兩國、俾勿爲東方事件所拘東（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）此半官方面發表公報、其內容與日本駐義大使白鳥　夫駐德大使大島將軍昨所發表之談話、不無出入之處、公報內開、各該大使所討論者、乃「日本加入德義兩國軍事同盟」問題、此在各報轉載上項談話時、則用「日本與軸心各國加緊合作、」字樣、此其不同之點、甚可注意、目下各該大使仍居在哥摩湖濱等待政府訓令、日本駐德義兩國大使館陸軍武官、則已前往義國北部波河流域參觀陸軍演習（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>日方此舉試探性質居多</p>
<p>（倫敦）日本駐德大使大島將軍、駐義大使白鳥敏夫、咋在義國哥摩湖濱維拉埃斯德鎭舉行會議、並發表談話、言外之意、乃謂日本大有加入義德兩國軍事同盟之可能、此間政界人士聞悉之餘、紛紛加以評論、大體以爲此項談話具有試探性質察其用意、乃因莫斯科現行談話告成在即、美國對日態度趨於强硬、爰向各民治國示威、特日本所可能之發動、義德兩國未必願予贊助、以自拘於的束、而日本亦未必願與各該國樹立過於硬性的聯繫關係、由此觀之、日本與德義軸心殆難切實合作、時報頃發表社評評論此事亦目白鳥大島兩大使之談話、具有試探之意、其言有云、「莫斯科談判已有進展、美國對日態度趨於强硬、日本爰謀壓迫英美蘇聯三國、向之發出諷示、謂各民治國倘不與日本保持正常關係、則該國隨時可與德義兩國締結同盟條的、特此種策略、未必能達到目的、且日本政府除由外交官與軍人發表談話而外、亦未必作進一步之行動、以增重所担負之義務、」强硬報載稱、「日本向德義兩國合作愈益密切、則美國蘇聯與西歐各民治國之聯帶關係，亦必愈益堅固、」此外其他各界人士、亦多議論及此、均謂日本若果參加德義同盟、則其音響徒足以危及本身、例如太平洋問題硏究會總秘書雷維亦以爲日木未必出此舉動、並謂美國宜吿廢止美日商約之事、已含有警吿之意、日本若果參加德義同盟、美國定必賡續有所舉動、査日本所需煤油、大部份來自美國、該國誠能停止供給、則日本對華戰事、即不能支持至六個月以上云、此在中國國民黨歐洲黨部代表則謂發、日本加入德義同盟、乃係德義軸。援助日本所提出之條件、以故此事勢不可免、「特吾儕國民黨員可於此獲有鼓勵、則以各民治國必能較易合作、美國亦必於遲早之間加入和平陣綫、此固吾人所歡迎不暇者也、」馬萊將軍乃係法國駐華軍隊前任司令、亦就日本加入德義同盟之議、表示意見、其言有云、日本對於各民治國在遠東所有屬地、未必能作切實的威脅、此其理由共有四端、（一）日本對華作戰已感困難無力顧及其他、（二）日本若果攻擊各民治國屬地、隨時有與蘇聯發生衝突之虞、（三）英法兩國在遠東合作、已於威林敦會議、（英國與澳洲聯邦暨紐西蘭自治領代表曾在威林敦城、會商太平洋防務、）新加坡會議之結果、擬定切實計畫、（四）遠東局勢若果惡化、美國態度自必愈益强硬、此乃日木最大危機所在、（四日哈瓦期電）</p>
<p>美國勢難與日訂新商約</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美政府官員對日本兩大使昨在意大利所發表言論、極爲關懷、政府當局並未正式發表意見僅云、日本若加入德義軍事聯盟、將更以交戰國之態度對付第三國、如是則美政府勢難與締結新商的、而美國民情亦必擁護政府禁運軍火至日、烏達州民主黨參議員金氏謂、日本此舉正可表示其以前與德意軸心互相標榜、而美日間之間隙必愈深、美國必採取更有效之防術手段、國會中或將再通過一二、〇〇〇、〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元之整　經費、金氏並謂、日人此舉將使英法蘇三國軍事聯盟締結更速、高級政府官員表示日人之加入德意軍事聯盟、將引起數新問題、（一）蘇聯將被包圍、（二）英國數處殖民地之力量將减弱、但下週中將在莫斯科舉行之英法蘇軍事談話、或將鑒於此數點、而加以防備、多數觀察家認爲日本此舉對於日本人民心理上影響最大、可對民主集團之反侵略運動作一抵抗、美外交界則認爲日本此舉在目前歐局衝突略平定之時、已不甚重要、彼等表示若歐戰爆發、美國或不能避免參加、故美國對於日本之外交政策、當加以注意無疑、政府中人皆信日人此舉於美國人民輿論上將無大影響、因美人民久已認此數集權國家爲一個軍事單位、但民情必贊助禁止軍火輸日、（五日美聯電）</p>
<p>對中日戰無多大影</p>
<p>（重慶）羅馬方面傳來日本駐義及駐德大使、會商與德義兩國締結軍事同盟條的消息、並未使此間官員震驚、多數官員今日相信、該項新聞係故意傳播、其目的爲增强日英談判中之日本地位、此間官方早已料及日本凖備與德意兩國締結軍事同盟之基礎、其主旨爲日本軍人答覆東京、華盛頓及倫敦間衝突之增加、自英日兩國舉行東京談判後、官方相信日本將以締結日德義三國軍事同盟、增强日本在談判中之地位、日方將恫嚇英國、除非英國對日本條件屈服、日本即將簽訂軍事同盟、華方官員聲稱、倘日本加入德義軸心、足予全能國家極需要之海軍實力、華方官員續稱在日本未發表日本加入羅馬柏林軍事同盟、渠等無從作一固定結論、渠等相信、日本傳播計劃簽訂軍事同盟消息、其目的爲增强未來日本之地位、並與英國立即談判、同時企圖劈裂英國蘇聯間之談判、因英蘇軍事同盟、將使蘇聯邊境二面受敵、東京談判並未結束、且蘇聯英國軍事同盟尙未簽訂、多數華人相信、日方簽訂軍事同盟消息、乃試探英國是吾具有簽訂和平公的並與日本和好之決心、中國並不憂慮軍事同盟對於中日戰爭影響若何、倘今年歐洲大戰不爆發、則軍事同盟、僅能助日以軍火、及其他接濟、華人相信耶日本不簽訂同盟、日本亦能得德義兩國之源源接濟、最近美國廢止美日商的、及美國擬實施禁止軍火輸往日本、將使日本地位變弱、較之軍事同盟所能對銷者爲多、良以德義兩國均感油棉及其他原料之缺乏、而該項軍事原料，爲日本所必需者、且全能國家短於資財、無從貸款予日、就華人觀察、軍事同盟將使日本在遠東之地位變弱、因歐洲大戰將耗竭日本海軍力堂、並妨碍將大批軍火其及他接濟源源流入中國淪陷區、供給在華作戰日軍、此間相信日本決意在遠東擴充實力、不至參加西方戰事、雖軍事同盟、能予日方藉口接收香港及英國在華租界之利益、但華人相信、日本於歐戰爆發時、即無軍事同盟、亦擬實施佔領此等區域、故軍事同盟、對日本可謂一無所助、若就義德調停中日戰事言之、華人聲稱、該種行動爲事實上所不能者、因渠等不信日本在談判時候提出蔣委員長認爲能接受之條件、（五日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（重慶）此間人士對於日本有加入義德軍事同盟可能之消息、叉引起此事對於中國抗戰是吾有利或有害之論爭、大多數人士之意見、以爲日本之加入該項同盟在最初階段內或將成爲一種擾亂之因素、但終必有利於中國、因此舉將可切實澄淸國際間之局勢、並迫使英法蘇等國放棄對日謀某項妥洽方案之希望、同時以上各國爲軍事上之需要起見必將援助中國之抗戰、（五日路透社電）</p>

<p>駐日大使克萊琪備致譽詞稱、克萊琪以甚大之能力、沉靜與勇氣、辦理極艱難之談判、首相繼言及談判之方案、謂方案詞句如何解釋、無關重要、但如何在實行中解釋其義、斯爲重要、如英政府聲明此方案並不含有政策變更之意、其實英國政策並未改變、則此聲明較其他一切更爲重要、無論如何、此方案已使吾人討論天津甚尖銳之局勢、以言其困難中若干點、似吾人在與日方謀妥洽時、應不致有大困難、余可言者、因雙方協定必須以整個言之、苟在他點有獲同意、則雖就一點有所同意、仍屬無益、現辦理談判者、並不若吾人在華所見的許多日人之趨向極端或</p>

<p>熱血沸騰但無論吾人情感如何、吾人幸勿忘吾人所已担負之責任、或當地吾國男女所處之地位云、張伯倫在結論時謂、吾人將勉力繼續談判、保持吾人行爲所依據之原則與該處英人之福利、吾人將竭力表示忍耐與合理的溫和、承認此種暴行之背後、或伏有在華日人對吾人待遇彼等之眞正疑慮、惟吾人不得忘却在今後數月中、或尙有更嚴重更迫切之問題須予考應、吾人必須保持力量、以應付或將發生之任何事變也云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）咋晚下院夏乎休會前討論遠東局勢時、工黨議員諾爾倍克發言云、吾人一方面以數千百萬之金錢反抗歐洲之侵略、而另一方面則又購買日本輸出之貨物、以資助其在遠東之侵峪、此種情形殊可驚異、日本現正使用一切暴力、企圖迫使英國爲其在華侵略之</p>
<p>真正同謀者、工黨各　員自始即對於東京談判表示憂慮、日人實企圖勒索並以東京之方案爲起點、以便續提遠大及不能接受之要求云、諾氏又對於大津聯合警務統制事、表示嚴重之疑懼、謂日本已在他處利用此點、以拘捕危害效忠中國政府之華人、日本之行爲、實損害吾人之威望、此種威望、在東方殊屬重要、如任其長此繼續則將損及英政府設法避免戰禍之全部政策矣、吾人應宣言中國爲和平陣綫一份子云、保守黨議員海軍大將凱葉斯爵士繼起宣稱、余與日人相處頗久、深知吾人如猶豫不決、及</p>
<p>自甘示弱、均將使其作進一步之侵略如過去能採取强硬行爲、則決不致引起今日之危險、英海軍人士皆知政府因欲避免在遠東方面發生意外、致令其海陸軍司令處於含垢忍辱之地位、並使彼等對於傲慢及野心之日木軍事領袖極感應付之爲難、在東方喪失顏面、雖爲極端嚴重之事、惟吾人現時如採取正當途徑、則吾人之威望、即可迅速恢復、吾人需要在東方有偉大之行動、俾可</p>
<p>昭示日人、吾歐洲人士將不容忍此類之行爲云、保守黨議員麥克那瑪拉最後發言、希望政府能於時局平定之後、對於中國之外國租界問題加以檢討、在軍事觀察點上此項租界實等於孤懸之哨位、令人感覺困累云、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）下議院本日午前開會、討論遠東問題時、重要議員數人如自　黨議員曼德。保守黨議員瑪克那馬拉上校等、均主各國凡與遠東有關係者、如澳大聯邦·紐西蘭自治領。荷屬東印度·法屬越南·　英法美國蘇聯應組成</p>
<p>聯合陣線、以與日木相抗、瑪克那馬拉上校並謂、「日本境內英文報紙屬於英商者僅居其一、其餘均爲美國人或日本人所辦、故英國之見解如何、未能爲日本人所了解、此層務常予以補救、」（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法各報評論　遠東時局　英相對日警告　忍耐實有限度</h3>
<p>（倫敦）每日郵報今日載社論、述及首相張伯倫昨日在下院所發之演說關於將派英艦隊至遠東一節、謂此確爲嚴重之言詞、惟此甚合吾國之氣分、每一英國公民同具首相宣布中國近發生若干事件已使共血脈僨張時所具之情緒、吾人之忍耐實有限度、此種對日人所發之警告、並未越過此界限、吾人今在歐洲已因事多而不勝忙碌、在目前局勢中、吾人在西方保持和平、實較在東方激起戰爭爲佳也、每日電聞曰、首相對於日本已發嚴重之警吿、此當可使東方明白吾人之忍耐非無窮盡者、吾人在他方面之重大擔任、使吾人應付遠柬之大局不得不出以謹愼、但若以爲英國之人民對遠東現所發生之一切將不憤　塡膺、實屬至大之錯誤云、泰晤十報謂、日本外交在已往兩月中曾受亞洲大陸日軍重大之壓迫、此實無疑者、惟謂日軍領袖對張伯倫所言英國或將被迫而取種種計畫一節、將無動於中、則亦未必若是之不近情理、目前之局勞、非爲使英政府願意分散其海軍實力者、然彼在東方爲日本辦理談判之較有理智者、苟知此種舉動已在豫備中、亦可使其反對天津爭案範圍之仟何擴大云、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）今晨巴黎各報暢論英相張伯　之言論與日本對軸心之地位而日方之要求允爲輿論所注意、秩序報載名記者貝爾蒂那一文、謂若日本侵迫有增無减而東京談判未見進步、則英相所可爲者唯有一面調回駐於津滬人數無多不能有所表演之英兵、一面照會日本如再有妨害英人利益之行爲、則英國將立即大規模援助蔣介石將軍並實施經濟制裁而已、但張伯倫果凖備作此有胆量的步驟乎、其所發之言殊不乏矛盾處也、時代報稱、日方欲與軸心國聯盟之提議、乃英國溫和姿勢之結果、目前吾人不能有所舉動以分離德義日英國因有田克萊琪之妥洽、已在實際上願讓日本從容攫取中國、然日本猶不以此爲滿足而竟垂涎香港越南菲列濱馬來與新加坡矣云、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）每日電　海軍記者賽華特於首相張伯倫在下院宣布英國或將派遣艦隊前往遠東後、今日評論遠東决國海軍之潛力、謂即在今日英國亦可逍派有充分力量足以組成海軍之戰艦隊前往太平洋、旣不致大减英國在歐之海軍力量且可制止日本在海上之大規模的投機行動、英政府己向澳洲切實允諾於必要時遣派此種艦隊赴新加坡、如果實行、則此艦隊將與來自中國澳洲與紐絲綸之巡艦至少十艘與驅逐艦隊及英國最佳潛艇十五艘相合、而成精銳海軍、至於日後復由國內與國外各處調往危險區之許多軍艦尙未計算在內一（五日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）孟却斯德指導報今日社論、謂張伯倫在上院之警論、將英國在華政策作第一决最坦直之分析、就共自己視中國為英日利益戰塲之有限的觀念點言之、張伯倫此决闡述英政府之所希望者、與所畏　者較諸尋常更爲正確、而在日本威脅較諸目前更屬不可容忍時英國將採更嚴厲行動一層、張伯倫亦愼重不諱言、以整個言、張伯倫此决言論視前　爲堅決、綜之無論政策强弱、吾人在遠東皆將遭多大之損失、惟政策懦弱則損失更多（五日路透電）</p>
<h3>渝報觀察　英國政策</h3>
<p>（重慶）英日協定宣布後、華人對英國在華政策所發生之誤會、今漸代以滿意、而日信英國不欲任令中國之銷落矣、今日重慶聯合日報載有一文題曰、「國際和平與公道之上趨、」內稱、美國之廢止美日商的、張伯倫在下院之演說重申美國在華政策之不變、西門爵士關於中國貨幣之宜言、克萊琪爵士在東京之拒絕交出天津英租界存銀、或禁止中國法幣在津流通、莫斯科談判之滿意進步、凡此胥足證明世界各國經營國際和平與公道之聯合陣錢日見强固而成更密切之合作云、苟非日本覺悟共自己之錯誤、推倒軍人之覇權、撒退在華之軍隊、則不特中國將繼續抗戰、抑且和平與公道的實力有效遏制其侵略之時日不久將臨、該文末曰、「吾人之最後勝利已毫無疑義、吾人長此堅决抗戰、則國際和平與公道終有一日抬頭、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>（重慶）英相張伯倫昨日在下院發表之言論、已引起此間人土兩種不同之感想、一部份人士以爲英相坦白討論遠東時局之態度、自遠較含混之宣言爲滿意、另一部份人士、則信英相之言論、未必有何益處、且徒足暴露英國在遠東方面無能爲力之狀態、或將更數勵日人之侵略、同時彼等對於英相所表示英國無能爲力之情形、表示懷疑、蓋以爲英國除强有力之艦隊外、尙有其他方法足以阻止日本也、（五日路透電）</p>
<h3>美國務副卿說明　遠東外交方針　應取途徑仍當單獨決定　對英合作並成立諒解</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）據副國務卿威爾斯今日答覆關於英相張伯倫演說中述及中國太局一節之問話、謂美國在遠東將自定其應行之途徑、美央兩國並無在東方取共同行動之諒解、威氏並拒絕評論張伯倫之演說、（四日路透社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）英國首相張伯倫本日在該國下議院所發表之演說、頃由此間政界人士加以解釋、謂共用意、乃籲請美國在遠東方面與英國合作、特未明白道破而已、此在美國政府各發言人、雖力言美國行動保有獨立性質、未與英國有何諒解、但若美國有所舉動以曉示日本、謂英美兩國在遠柬方面見解一致利益從同、則無論國會或輿論界均在原則上無何異議、輿論方而且以爲對日懲處手段、與其遲遲爲之、無寗提早實行之爲愈、特國務院中人則以爲目下並無重新舉動之必要、蓋日木若對西方各國在遠東之利益再予打擊、美國即常有所反應、此項决心、可於美國或在六個月後、禁止軍械與原料品運往日本一層顯示無餘、日本亦所洞悉、此際、美國某某報與政界若干人物、均主遣派海軍艦隊前往遠東示威、大抵總統若果作此决定、與論方面必可予以贊同、國會休憇室中並傳海軍艦隊行將駛往夏威夷島、但國務院與海軍部均謂未作此項决定云、此外、日本或將加入德義兩國軍事同盟條約、美國方面聞悉之餘、已感深刻印象、此祟若果實現、則羅斯福總統所持見解、即美國將受日德義三國聯合行動之威脅一項見解、即獲有證實、總統地位自必因而增强、可以斷言、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>金融　新鈔之恐慌未消　資金又作逃避之計　美滙進八元關　英滙近四辦士</h3>
<p>外滙昨日巿况、滙豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美滙暗巿、上日外電財部向英倫添印新鈔十萬萬張、人心未脫恐慌狀態、且日行正金橫檳與華商紗花帮等猛力吸收、兼香港亦來電傾扒、加以外行如滙豐等供意殊淡、大非貴價不願脫手、致形勢再趨緊軟、一度英金曾緊至四辦士零六二五、美滙亦破入八元大關、退達七元八七五、午刻扒風稍戢、市勢略乎、結果以英金四辦士零九三七五、美滙七元九三七五收盤、而本月期貨、因華商投機家與日行等扒興亦濃、致英金遂破入四辦士關內、終則英續緊二一八七五、美又軟四三七五、中途稍多曲折、但尙無過大波浪、半天交易頗旺、至港滙情况、亦稍帶混亂、最後銀行賣價、竟縮至二十八元二五、</p>
<p>華日商相繼爭購</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠期均回長零六二五、紐的銀價呆定、倫教生金仍平、滙兌英對美未史、對滬小一二五，對法勿動、美對英。對法均平、對滬降二角、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士二五、美滙八元二五、較隔咋英緊零四六八七五、美軟零六二五、開後因洋行界稍有結款、致市况帶緊、計洋行首先扒結外行現貨英金四辦士二五及一二八七五、並又現貨美滙爲八元二一八七五、嗣雖紗花帮亦來扒結、但因其時外行賣意尙濃、致市勢一度回硬、計大通華比有利相繼塞予紗花帮現貨美滙八元二五、同時某美行售予同行現貨美滙八元二八一二五、兼又本月份英金四辦士零六二五、迨滙豐掛牌揭晚、悉無上落、及白銀平衡稅揭曉依然免微、此後因日銀行界驟來扒吸、加以外行賣意轉淡、致市勢復緊、計日行橫濱正金結進外行現貨英金四辦士一八七五、時港電亦來猛扒、且華商與日行續來活動、故爲狀愈緊、計日行與港電相繼扒進外行滙豐等現貨英金由四辦士一二五緊至零六二五、並購結某行現貨美滙由八元縮至七元八七五、繼而日行正金又扒進華比等外行本月份英金三辦士九六八七五、不久又與華商結進某行本月份美滙七元六八七五及六二五、時已午刻、聞港滙銀行現貨賣價已縮至二十八元二五、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士零九三七五、美滙七元九三七五、本月份英金三辦士丸零六二五、美匯七元五六二五、結果比上日、現貨英續緊一零、三一二五、美又軟三七五、本月份英軟二一八七五、美貴四三七五、午後週六無市、</p>
<p>香港申滙猛升</p>
<p>香港五日電、今日匯巿開盤平穩、英日各匯不動、美匯遠期縮零六二五、爲二十八元半、申匯升六元、爲三百四十二元、十一時三十分、由穩轉軟、英匯現貨緊零三一二五、爲一先令二辦士六五六二五、遠期不動、美匯縮零六二五、現貨爲二十八元五六二五、遠期爲二十八元四三七五、申匯續升六元、爲三百四十八元、日匯縮一二五、爲一百零四元半、午收英匯現貨不動、遠期跟緊零三一二五、爲一先令二便士六二五、申滙又升二元、爲三百五十元、半日共升十四元、下午週六及下星期一均無市、</p>
<p>天津匯巿亦縮</p>
<p>天津五日電、今日匯巿開盤疲軟、對英縮二五、爲三便士三七五、對美緊半元、爲六元五六二五、申匯升五元、爲一百二十七元、「聯鈔」暗盤昂一元半、爲一百零一元、</p>
<h3>十萬萬張　新鈔成謎</h3>
<p>爲了路透社十萬萬張新鈔一電，頓使滬上金融界，又生劇變，黃金兩日來漲起二百五十五元，美滙兩日來縮去四六八七五，英滙縮去二三四三七五，紗價爲之大漲，公債爲之大跌，外幣連速上升，英金鎊至九十三元，美金元至九十七元，市上對於此十萬萬張新鈔票，雖同懷恐慌心理，而其爲猜謎也則一，有猜爲通貨更將膨脹者，亦有謂內中一部分係金庫券，將以專爲購買外匯之用者，亦有猜爲預備戰後整理通貨之用者，又有謂自雜鈔遂漸收縮後，誠恐市上籌碼缺乏，用以補充者。並有謂自發鈔集中以來，鈔票發行，尙有中國交通兩行，將來總應由中央一行發行，故中央銀行定印如許之鈔票，以目前人心浮動，稍有消息，推波助瀾，想此事不日當可分曉，而大部分鈔票究竟尙在倫敦印刷中也。</p>
<h3>美金一元　値法幣九十七元</h3>
<p>昨日外幣因外匯烚赤昂貴影響、英美金鎊、供給稀少、上漲銳利、英金鎊爲九十三元五角、美金鎊爲九十七元、英美金票需要更殷、市况堅俏、英金票爲五十八元、美金票爲十三元零六分、香港票法郞票需要亦殷、均趨上升、新加坡票荷蘭票等、皆跟隨上漲、日金票亦趨堅挺、晚市爲一元零九分、朝鮮票亦牽動上升、晚市爲八角九分、公會交易、僅勤泰出祥豐進美金票五百元、昨日市價、英金鎊英金票各升二元五角、美金鎊升四元、美金票升四角一分、香港票升一角三分、法郞票升三一厘、新加坡票荷蘭票各升三角、安南票羅比票德金票、各升一角、坎拿大票升八角、斐律濱票升二角、義大利票升二分、澳金票升二元、僅暹邏票未更、</p>
<h3>外匯緊至維持價　黃金直上雲霄</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况漲風益熾、幾打破三千九百元大關、惟中途起伏頗速、時上時下、大致均隨外匯緊鬆爲轉移、初時因聞外匯晨開續軟、加以上日財部向英倫添印新鈔之消息、傳說仍盛、且尙有一般業外者鑒於趨勢向升、亦前來羅購、處於買風籠罩下、竟橫跳一百〇五元、開盤達三千八百元大關、嗣因外匯突然稍回、引起賣風、某金號（代投機商）暨其他金號等爭前塞出、市象一度轉疲、竟傾瀉至三千七百三十元低盤、九時三刻光景、聞外匯猛緊、已逼近平準會之匯豐維持供給價、買風復盛、錢兌業富商力吸、兼設券帮亦進多出少、加以售者扳價頗夥、飛躍直上、昂達三千八百九十五元高峯、午刻外滙轉平、且某錢兌業力塞數十兩、延至午收回達三千八百五十五元、結果比隔昨竟又飛漲一百六十元、午後無正式行市、據聞塲外三千八百六七十元均有成交做開、半天交易、零多躉少、的六百餘兩、銀樓飾金、終則掛高十五元、海關金與中英純金等仍均無變化、</p>
<p>烚赤漲一六〇元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因聞外匯續緊、人心更堅、買風陡起、證劵帮進意允濃、加以售者覜望、開市竟橫跳一百〇五元、證券帮進某金號十兩、價三千八百元、嗣聞外匯稍回、致進者頓稀、且某金號代投機商獲利出籠、兼其他金號亦有賣意、故回跌亦勁、不久即暴落七十元、金號賣予銀樓帮二十兩、價三千七百三十元爲當日低盤、九時四十分光景、聞外匯又趨緊軟、故重引起買風、且某金號亦止塞觀望、漲七十元、證劵帮賣予錢兌業二十兩、價三千八百元、時某銀樓代客吐售、一度略挫、某銀號塞予錢兌業二十兩、價三千七百九十二元、繼又吐予證劵帮十兩、價三千七百九十元、此後聞外匯緊勢愈厲、賣戶扳價更夥、漲風又起、竟再飛升一百〇五元、證券帮進錢兌業二十兩、價三千八百九十五元爲當日高峯、將近午刻、聞外匯止緊稍回、某錢兌業力售數十兩、價頓見回小四十元、某錢兌業賣予某銀號二十兩、爲三千八百五十五元、作午收價、結果比隔昨飛漲一百六十元、半天一百六十五元上落、現金號之本牌金照烚赤較高十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、據詢鮮有做開、</p>
<p>飾金掛高十五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸三百七十五元、迨至九時三十七分忽掛大十元、十降五十分回跌五元、十一時又掛大五元、十一時四十分又高五元、十一時五十七分再掛大五元、十二時十分回落五元、此後未聞更動、計共掛高十五元、大伺行改懸三百九十元、新同行爲三百八十八元、收進的减低念元光景、</p>
<h3>貼現又昂十元</h3>
<p>昨滙劉票據貼現率、突復高昂、每千元終日盤旋於二百元關左右、起落不定、晨初即高至一百九十元、需求現鈔者不惜高價貼出收進、頓見飛上至二百十元、近午始漸回、退至一百九十五元、下午一度又高至二百元、最後爲一百九十五元、較之前日升高十元、錢業公會拆息早午兩市仍開二角勿更云、</p>
<h3>糧食　米商正與限價決鬬　米號業勸告遵守限盤　各米店態度轉形消極　運銷合作操縱滬米市</h3>
<p>粳秈　自塲外交易盛行、打破限價、飛漲至二十三四元後、一般米舖門市、大都仍照限盤出售、然照目下情形、欲依限盤進貨、勢不可能、致一般米號、處此環境、困苦難言、昨遂在市塲勸吿米號同業從事登記、若有超出限盤交易、一律作罷、聽候租界當局處置、當時情形激烈、市塲營業因之又無形停頓、惟據行家云、一般行家、本處中間地位、與米號往來轉手、僅一角一分行佣、限價超過與吾、本在米號業之自破其律、而使客囤得以乘機居奇抬便、若米號業能一體遵守、則行家本處中間地位、何價可抬、總之、此種請形、均徒顧一己之私利、不爲民食着想、致造成今茲現象耳、至市塲交易、旣無形停頓、昨日曾用電話向幾家著名米廠號買米、問「好米有嗎？」答、「無」、問「米啥價錢」答「二十元、問「米好嗎」答「不好吃」、再問則不答、問之五六家、都是如此答話、可見米店家這套答語、是預備就的、吾則何以能「衆口一辭」、但經調查、單就梅白格路某大米廠之棧房而論、終日碾米機聲不絕、二層樓上包子纍纍、何得謂爲無米、不過不肯賣二十元一石、大概老主顧可以買到、宿貨在二十一元三四角、鮮貨在二十二元左右、惟如生客及用電話去問、則均回答無貨、米店用心如是、惟恐有人去調查、說他破壞限價、其實此種作風、亦無非欲將限價寬放、且放一二元、尙不饜所望、米店經過「八一三」戰事發生後撿米風潮、懲前毖後、在本店內不欲多存米、各堆棧中亦不欲公然存米、因可派人去調查、故將米分藏於各處、以便遮入耳目、而策安全、現在則與米販一吹一打、米販不肯出樣、欲出樣非售若干不可、米店則楊言米無可進、儘底貨賣完了事、運銷合作、操縱滬上米市、於是人心更惶惶、不知不覺墮入米商穀中、使米商振振有詞、不待要求、而限價目行寬放、早先米在客戶囤戶手中尙多、故米商亦主張辦理國戶登記、共後、客戶之米、並以霉蒸關係、陸續出檔、已入於米商手中、故不聞追究圈戶矣、總之、米價之漲有二因焉、米商欲將木地出產之米價、與進口洋貨之價、同樣上漲、二則勾結某某方面、此應彼和、大演雙簧、威脅滬上人士之生活、使不得不歸於內地、以遂某方「復興」內地之方案、昨日各貨在此種情形之下自無做開、河下到米、到南港帮四號、車輪包子、南帮貨一千一二百包、</p>
<p>昨日客秈暗盤、已經絕跡、因經米號業公會派員在市勸各米店切勿逾限買進、日前十八九元之京蕪高秈、均無暗盤成交、即十六元以內砶糙各秈交易亦復寥落、且傳蕪米又有開禁希望、市上人心回定、中决售價亦略形帶平云、</p>
<p>洋米　產價相差甚鉅、新交易、難於短期內實現、貨方心思益堅、新陳西貢統乏出樣云、</p>
<h3>麵粉一律售現　小麥又升二角</h3>
<p>麵粉　連日北洋帮匯劃、成交達五萬包、故廠方暫停供給、一面將本街批價再度提升、由五元二角漲至五元三角、本客一律均係現鈔交易、故昨日成交祇本街及內地散帮辦去二萬包左右、今日有二萬七千包、運往天津、</p>
<p>小麥　存底不及往年之多、市價升一角、計由福阜兩廠辦去京蕪丹陽等麥五車、價爲七元至六元八角半、囤戶進南京浦鎭蘇州崑山等麥六車、價爲七元二角半至六元八角半、</p>
<h3>紗花　亦爲新印鈔票　紗價大漲　雙馬出六百元關</h3>
<p>紗市漲風奇爉、緣市塲上利多消息接踵而來、謂倫教英公司承印中國法幣額量甚巨、外匯轉縮、黃金又復上騰、鼓動人心、買氣頓見熱烈、一時檯面乾枯、賣者束手籌碼益感匱乏、市價乃扶搖直上、新高峯層出不窮、二十支雙馬穿出六百零三元、比上决之頭盤再漲七元、下身冷門紗與熱門貨落後距離愈遠、故價格雖廉、但一般經營者仍無團購之舉、因其走勢太呆之故也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開即漲五六元、二十支雙馬棧單五百七十六元、外棧現貨五百九十元、少頃傳言紛紜、買者有爭先恐後之勢、市盤得此推動、大有紗荒之象、賣價乃節節前進、一霎間雙馬出六百元、但暗中仍以呌買聲爲盛、迨至收盤最高價、爲六百零三元、棧單五百九十一元、行情二十支雙馬漲十七元、牧羊漲十三元半、雙地球漲十五元、申新廠開出二十支雙馬一千九百包、價爲五百九十元、每包收定洋穴十元、今日有棉紗一千三百七十件運天津、五件遝香港、一百九十件運北海、六十五件運海防、一百十件運暹羅、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>日紗巿面亦大漲、查其原因、謂現貨缺而囤戶積存、且流言紛紜、買者允擁、二十支月琴本月份始做四百六十七元、收盤價爲四百七十二元云、</p>
<h3>外棉盡爲　日商收去　火機花開九十五元</h3>
<p>中外棉花交易、繼續進展、日廠向號家大量購買、搜羅之繁、倍蓰於華廠、售價因之步提、咋做行市、再漲三四元、華商新裕廠進通州打包六百件、價爲九十五元、（鈔票棧交）其他同業互相買賣、愈形活躍、火機花亦有二百包成交、價爲九十五元、（鈔票棧交）蘇北來源、又見旺盛、到通州細絨花六百三十一包、茲將現棉做開情形錄左、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、日來同業日趣熱鬧、雖華廠亦略有小額交易、然大部却爲日廠所巡、同業中之手貨幾大半已被日廠吸購、日來售價之步漲、乃係本埠存底日减之故、預計日內棉價尙有上漲之可能也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉巿開盤之初、殊爲靜寂、後因利物浦來電吿跌、投機商乘機買出、同時引起小額之套賣、中途利物浦及孟買來電轉好、棉區氣候報吿惡劣、因此市面一度轉好、收盤時終因海外棉商之拋賣、及多頭了結而下落、價格較之上日跌七至十磅音、印度運同預測跌一羅比、埃及漲七八磅音、</p>
<h3>證劵　外股繼續進展　內債跌勢加厲</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日巿况、繼續趨跌、視前爲厲、交易較多，但仍不甚踴躍、一般人以爲外匯再緊、金子又漲，以習慣論、公債市價每與之背道而馳、其實按現在通貨膨脹之巳經實現、加以最近向英國定印鈔票十萬萬、將來通貨流通額愈多、貼水價自然趨於水準、銀根亦自然趨於鬆動、故債市前途、必有良好現象、但恐非一時間所可成就、昨日經過因有特別緣因、十一號及四十九號賣出最湧、二十五及四十二號亦均有賣出、潤利亦略有供出、買進者以五號及恒孚天生等號爲多、散戶亦頗有吸收、結果續小七角半至一元有奇、成交總數的計四五十萬元、至倫敦中國外債仍告平穩無變化、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交南洋兄弟烟草公司股五十股、價爲八元五角半、</p>
<p>又上海衆業公所報吿云、昨晨股市續形進展、價見上升、一般股票成交價格略高、以英楂華橡皮股票成交愈旺、收盤成交價爲二十四元二角半、股價之漲、似由於外匯之稍形緊縮、以致各項橡皮股票買氣更見濃厚、</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠東各公司股票、本月四日（週五）掛牌行市、又吿下降、麥加利銀行股跌二先令六便士，價爲六鎊十五先令、匯豐銀行香港註冊股降一鎊、價爲七十六鎊、古拉客林傍橡皮股回跌四便士半、價爲十七先令九便士、餘無變動、</p>
<h3>油餅　生油盛銷　行情猛提二三元　豆油巿况稍回平</h3>
<p>生油本街香港內地各帮、辦胃突增、行情猛提二三元、共成交膠州簍裝油三百件、四十三元、轉棧貨四十一元至四十二元、靑島聽裝油四干七百聽、價自五十一元步升至五十三元五角、又桶裝油五十五桶、五十四元至五十五元五角、次包桶裝油十二桶、五十三元七角、天津聽裝油二百聽、五十一元、</p>
<p>豆油巿氣稍平、神戶來連油原盤四十七元八角、成交五白餘桶、膠州簍裝油升三角、爲三十四元三角、成交二百件、</p>
<p>出口、六日有豆子三百八十包生仁七百包運香滿港</p>

<p>東疋　昨日貨細布、細斜實銷雖淡、而囤購益盛、互相拉提狂騰、十二磅龍頭細布本月份見十七元二角半之新紀錄、下月份十七元四五角、中下檔之雜牌細布每疋亦跳起五六角、細斜每疋升二角半至五角、終以籌碼枯竭、本街成交亦祇五六百件、公大紗廠開出十二磅變龍珠細布現貨三百包、十六元二角半、伊滕訂出木月期飛魚細布一百包、十六元八角、下月份案價竟需十七元五角之鉅、</p>

<h3>因奸徒作崇　巿塲昨又起波動　事實證明法幣準備充實　巿塲毫無通貨膨脹現象</h3>
<p>自中國政府以全力維持法幣價値後、全國金融、愈趨穩定、今因電傳英國承印中國紙幣、以致上海金融市塲奸人作祟、發生波動、但事實證明、並求通貨膨脹、望各界無庸疑慮、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>奸人作崇　巿塲波動</p>
<p>自路透社倫敦電傳、中國政府與英國印鈔公司兩家、訂立託印紙幣合同、共逾十萬萬張後、上海金融市塲、投機者故意造謠、操縱市塲、以圖牟利、以致外滙黑市、黃金暗市等、、發生巨大之波動、（一）外滙黑市、英商滙豐銀行掛牌、仍舊不動、而實際行市又縮、英滙四便士二五、美滙八元二五、（二）證券暗市、上午收盤統一甲五十四元四角、乙四十三元八角、丙四十一元八角半、丁四十元零三角、戊四十一元兀角、跌七角至一元五角不等、（三）黃金收盤、爲三千八百五十五元、</p>
<p>事實證明　並未膨脹</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉中國法幣之發行、至今年六月底止、共二十六萬二千六百九十二萬九千三百元、現金準備、在百分之四十四以上、仍較多數國家現金準備爲高、且政府一再聲明、決以全力維持法幣之價値、對淪陷區域更有充分之準備、一切對外支付、仍以法幣爲基礎、各方或以通貨膨脹爲懼、但政府之舉措、則適與此相反、而法定外滙、始終維持、各市塲中反覺籌碼不足、毫無通貨膨脹之現象、</p>
<p>維持法幣　博得好評</p>
<p>中國法幣信用、始終不墜、並足堅固人民對法幣之信仰、即間接可堅固人民對政府之信仰、現在淪陷區域人民、無不喜藏法幣、以保障其財產、此蓋由於維持法幣信用之所致、所以政府對於抗戰、從未乞靈於紙幣政策、爲開闢稅源、如創辦新稅整理舊稅、發行各種公債、已博得中外人士之好評、而維持法幣之價値、則尤爲各方所稱道讚揚、因法幣法價打破、不但失去政府一極好資產、且失去人民對政府之信仰、</p>
<p>添印新幣　兩種意義</p>
<p>字林報云、關於中政府向倫敦兩印鈔公司定印紙幣十萬萬張以上事、本埠華人銀行界雖未接消息、惟著名銀行家某氏頃語記者、對中國當局印此紙幣之意嚮、提供數種作參考之意見、（一）新幣全部或一部份或係「外匯」紙幣、由中國流通於中國市塲、專供購買外滙、俾防杜人民將法幣易成外滙、致利日人、若此項意見成爲事實、則全國任何人不得重慶准許、實無購買外匯之機會矣、（二）重慶印新紙幣、其志或在替代今在流通之破舊紙幣、該銀行家聲稱、渠在美國時、曾見美國某印鈔公司日印紙幣五萬萬張、其意非謂美國日需如許新紙轄、諸銀行家訂印大批新紙幣者、或將按時任其流通於市、以代自市上收回之舊幣、</p>
<h3>防範「八一三」紛擾　採取嚴峻戒備　各防軍已商妥防範辦法　全滬駐軍探捕一體出動</h3>
<p>「八一三」滬戰第二週年、轉瞬屆臨、兩租界警務當局、因上月間會數决發生暴徒搗擾報館情事、故於上月下旬、即採取聯合戒備、隨時派遣鐵甲車及探捕實施緊急搜查、頗著宏效、故當局對此紀念期間、仍當施行此種特殊措置、以策界內治安、同時並自今日起、至十六日止、十一日內禁止任何社團之開會·結社·遊行·等活動、在此時期、由探捕分駐各公共塲所監視、聞對於一部份之馬路、仍當予以封鎖、動員駐軍及商團鐵甲車、分區巡弋、而特別注意毘連華界區域之防務、對於戒嚴法令、則决嚴厲執行、各馬路增加崗位及巡邏、藉以輩固防務、而日方則亦已在虹口各橋樑及四郊冷靜處所、增加鐵絲網等障碍物、</p>
<p>各防軍商　戒務細則</p>
<p>字林報云、上海各防軍指揮官、昨日（四日）晨會晤、討論將在此間所取戒備之細則、以免八月九日至十三日間、滬戰週年紀念日發生任何不測事件、此决戒備、與去年預防、有若干不同、未能確悉、聞諸可靠方面、觀於現有恐怖份子在兩租界作可能的圖謀不軌之處、故本年之戒備、或稍將加緊、但與去歲之辦法多少相同、又聞戒備期間、宵禁雖將甚嚴格厲行、但不致提早、</p>
<p>整個上海　全體動員</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、鑒於兩租界內與界外區域近起大膽恐怖事件甚多、而持械暴徒刻正利用租界與華界作政治活動、聞兩租界當局將在八一三滬戰兩週紀念日繼續加强戒備辦法、據某數方面意見、整個上海將動員、以資應付此緊急時期、</p>
<p>採取特殊　保護辦法</p>
<p>惟自官方僅探當局刻正縝密硏究局勢、而將復作週年紀念日之防範、八月十三日爲星期日、乃上海區戰事之兩週紀念日、衆覺恐怖份子將圖利用此日從事活動、已往經騐、已表示此種紀念日常起暴行、故須取特殊之防範與保護辦法、否則紛擾殆不可免、</p>
<p>嚴行宵禁　四處搜查</p>
<p>衆料租界區中之週年紀念日緊急狀態、將自八月九日擴展至十五日、其間將嚴格實行宵禁、兩租界當局將作密切合作、如目前之積極控制愛多亞路然、數要點已建有石質防壘、週年紀念日期問防壘中將不斷駐兵防守、今已習見之有刺鐵絲網障碍物、無疑的將架於租界各入口處、此舉對公衆雖或不便、然於協助軍警實行職務、已確切證明大爲重要、行人車輛以及恐怖份子或將匿跡其中或從事密議之里衖旅舍等、將遭檢查、</p>
<p>萬國商團　積極準備</p>
<p>對於前已發生暴行之地、以及接獲恐嚇信之商業機關、將維持警戒之注視、美意陸戰隊·英法軍隊·與萬國商團、均將出動、而各自活動於防區中、衆信萬國商團各隊、均將從事積極的軍事職務、不僅整裝待令而已、萬國商團之白俄隊、將活動於外灘中區與老閘區、及守衛障碍物前、警務處後備隊亦將召出担任積極職務、</p>
<p>娛樂塲所　亦將停業</p>
<p>在此緊急時期內、華人之屋頂花園及娛樂塲所、大致多將暫停、以紀念滬戰之爆發、而免不良份子混雜顧客之中、許多戲院於八月十三日亦將停業、如去歲然、蘇州河北區、將有日兵搜查與巡邏、</p>
<h3>撫慰難民　表揚忠烈　淪陷區民衆受痛苦　被災難民積極救濟</h3>
<p>自抗戰以來、將士効命、前仆後繼、其忠烈之氣、誠足以泣鬼神而驚天地、若任其湮沒弗傳、何以表揚忠烈、故特通令調查抗戰以來、殉職殉難軍民官吏、並規定嗣後凡遇有此等死難事蹟、應隨時隨事塡表具陳、並陸續集會追悼、共死難壯烈、功在黨國者、允應會同當地政府呈請褒卹、以彰潛德、而勵來茲、又淪陷區域民衆、飽嘗欺侮凌辱、精神上當感莫大之痛苦、各戰區於收復淪陷之縣市後、當即派員前往撫慰、並協同軍政當局、積極救濟被災之難民、</p>
<h3>北江西路　情形安靜　遷徙者已减少</h3>
<p>北江西路南起自來水橋北堍、北迄老靶子路東端一埭商店住戶、以及里弄自被日方封鎖後、居民當時遷徙情形、極爲慌亂、惟經過一星期之時間、是種慌亂情態已减、據大通社記者昨晨赴該路巡歷、除崇明路缺口內衛、及海寗路缺口內團、仍有日兵崗哨外、文監師路缺口、則自撤退後、即不復設、居民經數日之遷徙、顯然减少、故今晨搬家者已不多見、規模較小之店舖、頗見照常營業者、進出缺口之居民、亦尙自由、缺口外圍、華捕仍駐守中、總合情態、尙屬安靜、</p>
<p>復興金長到期本息　由四行貼現付款　統一甲種十日舉行抽籤　還本付息爲明年一月底中中交農四行、對關稅担保内債本息、允予貼現付款後、第七次統一公債本息、已於七月三十一日起開始付款、第七次復興公債本息、已定八月三十一日開始付款、第十二决金融長期公價本息、亦定九月三十日開始付款、至於統一公債第八次還本付息、定明年一月三十日開始付款、至於抽籤、甲種定八另十日在滬舉行、國債基金管理委員會、已函市商會·銀錢業公會等、屆時派員蒞塲監視、聞抽籤二十五支、還本四百四十萬元、又乙丙丁戊各種、亦已分別定期舉行抽籤</p>
<h3>江灣鎗聲　機槍聲及步槍聲　機續不斷者半日</h3>
<p>字林報云、昨日（四日）午後三至四時間、聞江灣方面發出沉重之機關槍聲、而於午後將近十一時、又聞該方面傳來斷續之步槍聲、至昨日深夜、未悉詳情、</p>
<h3>分幣　卽將發行　以法幣爲十足準備</h3>
<p>中央銀行奉財政部令、爲救濟上海市面銅輔幣缺乏起見、已與香港永寧印刷公司訂立承印合同、發行分幣劵五十萬元、計一分三十萬元、五分二十萬元、一俟印竣、即行發行該項分幣券以法幣爲十足之準備、預料本月中旬、即可印竣交貨、歸中央銀行上海分行負責發行流通市面、此爲臨時救濟市面辦法、將來擬發行鋁質硬幣、</p>
<h3>米巿雖停頓　取締暗盤加嚴　到貨繼續不斷囤戶頗有售意　陸運車輛缺乏並非來源被阻</h3>
<p>國米市塲、連日來因來源較稀、米商居奇操縱、不願將粳米出樣應市、致市塲情形紊亂、暗盤叢生、但租界常局爲維持民食起見、繼續執行限價、調查棧存、取締囤積、米商不得不有所顧忌、據新新社記者探悉、豆米業公會此决發表之棧存各米、粳米仍佔半數同時河下到船業已繼續不斷、四日到十餘船、五日亦到七八艘、至於陸路運輸、因車輛缺乏、到貨不多、並非來源被阻、</p>
<p>當局考慮　疏通來源</p>
<p>上海豆米業公會委員陳子彝朱子香、於前日晋謁公共租界工部局副總辦何德奎、除報吿上海豆米市塲情形外、爲維持滬市民食起見、要求（一）設法疏通來源、使蕪湖等處之米運滬、（二）設法訂購運滬接濟、聞工部局已允考慮、惟對於食米之限價、决切實執行、並准隨時舉發各米號超越限價情事、以便取締查辦、</p>
<p>巿塲交易　趨於停頓</p>
<p>福州路靑運閣豆米市塲、昨日上午九時開市後、因駐塲之監視員、取締暗盤交易甚嚴、塲內各行號均須簽字、規定白粳不得超過二十元、客秈不得超過十六元、如有違背、决予拘辦、於是巿塲內交易無形停頓、而暗盤交易、改在塲外直接洽商、所以昨日在巿塲內成交者、僅冬霜等米、且爲數甚徵、</p>
<h3>錢兌業代價劵　妥善收回　爲數有限　手續簡單</h3>
<p>錢兌烟兌兩業、頃以中央銀行發行局所印之五十萬元輔幣券、行將運　發行、對於以前各莊號於銅分幣缺乏時自由製訂之分幣臨時代價券、亟應及早收回、以便新券到滬、統一流通市而、昨據大光社記者向該兩業探悉、會員莊號所發之臨時券、已經該兩公會當局分囑妥善收回、於新券未到滬前、可儘量使川郵票、藉應環境之急需、聞該兩業此决所分發之臨時券、爲數並不衆多、收回手續、至爲簡單</p>
<h3>方糖塊糖禁運</h3>
<p>財政部令各海關云、查前定非常時期禁止進口洋貨表、業經令飭遵照在案、茲查進口稅則第二九九號所列之方糖塊糖、亦應一併列入禁運品之內、合亟令仰遵照、</p>

<h3>日艦昨砲轟鎭海　滬輪開七里嶼　甌江口已被用砂石堵塞　開放鳌江短期內可決定</h3>
<p>行駛滬甬綫之四輪、現下均在鎭海口、咋日攄本市某輪公司接寗波軍吿、謂鎭海口前日遭日艦砲轟、前後十餘發、各輪均開往七用嶼暫避、客貨因之延時起卸、謀福寶利兩輪、原定昨今返滬、受上述之影響、須延至下星期一（七日）始可返滬、</p>
<p>日艦砲轟</p>
<p>鎭海口外運日日艦往來頻繁、頃據航業界消息、七里嶼洋面、現泊有日艦一艘、尙無異動、瀝港洋面、三日下午二時到日艦二艘、放下汽艇遊弋、旋開蟹沛、向岸上開砲十餘發、並無報失、穿山洋面停泊三日艦、四日晨向岸上開砲七八發、</p>
<p>甌江堵塞</p>
<p>日方封鎖溫州航運，在先以軍艦往來遊弋、禁止任何航輪駛入甌江、目前已用漁船載沙石沉沒甌江口外、實行堵塞航運、故今後滬溫復航、事實上已無可能、神光輪此次後航未成、一來一去、共費時ー星期所，所幸未裝載客貨、損失甚微、</p>
<p>開放鼇江</p>
<p>滬溫復航受阻後，航業界爲疏洩滬溫間客貨運、呈請當局開放鼇江、據航業界消息、當局已允加以考慮、短期內可望實現、各外輪公司正辦理登記手續、一俟邀准、即可恢復開航、屆時溫州各埠客貨運、皆可繞道轉運、</p>
<h3>監委毛勉廬逝世　今日舉行公祭</h3>
<p>假座寗波同鄕會監察院委員毛勉廬、上月在奉化原籍逝世、中央已電令優卹、茲有毛氏滬上門弟子曹靜淵等三十餘人、定今日午前九時、假座虞洽卿路寗波旅滬同鄕會、舉行公祭、以表哀思、</p>
<h3>兆豐公園銅樂會</h3>
<p>工部局音樂隊定於六日下午五時半至七時（如天氣良好）、在兆豐公闌舉行銅樂會、節目計有七項、</p>
<h3>潘棠華氏談　國貨暢銷南洋羣島　近百萬華僑多樂爲購用　月捐薪工接濟抗戰工作</h3>
<p>本市渣華公司經理潘棠華氏、對於推銷國貨、素具熱忱、本埠國貨之得暢銷海外、厥功尤偉、潘氏曾於本年三月二十一日離滬出國、赴南洋羣島考察國貨推銷情況、茲以考察完畢、乘法郵杜美總統號、於昨晨由港抵滬、本埠國貨廠商赴新關碼頭歡迎者甚衆、棉蘭中華商會委昌潘志輝，及新加坡商界钜子李巧光兩君、亦隨同潘氏來滬、考察本國國貨事業、記者咋往訪唔潘氏、承告此行經過及南洋華僑現狀、分誌各情如次、</p>
<p>足跡所至</p>
<p>遍及南洋</p>
<p>潘氏首稱、　在抗戰以前發、我國國貨事業、日形發展、國內推銷、亦甚興旺、如雲南，漢口，重慶，河南，河北，山東等處、平時均向上海及香港採辦國貨、滬戰爆發後、沿海各口、均被日方封銷、內地交通阻塞、國貨界遂受重大打撃、本人深覺在抗戰時期之祖國工商業、非另闢新徑、不足以培養戰時生產、此行經西裏伯島之孟爪哇羣島之泗水，三寶，壟，井里汶，八打威（吧城），及蘇門答臘之棉蘭市、而至新加坡轉香港回滬、</p>
<p>各地市場</p>
<p>暢銷國貨</p>
<p>上述諸地、戰前本為日貨傾銷之大市場、自抗戰後、日本工人、多從事於重工龍之生產、以致日貨成本加重、較之戰前、爲五與一之比、國貨遂得暢銷、現南洋羣島有十分之六為國產物品、棉縱品如襯衫.棉衫等、均爲香港國貨出品、什貨類如呢帽.線毯.熱水瓶，電珠，牙刷，襪，手巾，手帕，汗衫，皮球等、均向上海採購、其中尤以棉織品及毛巾襪等最爲暢銷、惟香港之棉織品、質量均較上海爲優、希望本埠各廠商、對此有所改進、新加坡及棉藺，均有中國銀行支行、匯兌購貨、極爲便利、現時外滙、雖布所變動、殊無影響於國貨之推銷、現法幣百元、約合荷幣十五盾左右、</p>
<p>華德愛國</p>
<p>抵制日貨</p>
<p>華僑關懷祖國抗戰勝利之熱枕、殊令人感動、對抵制日貨運動、尤爲努力、平時用日貨者、現均改刖國貨、設有華僑棄國貨而仍則日貨、則先之以警吿、罰令捐輸救國金、新加坡有「喑查」二千餘人、專察華僑之是否購買日貨工作、</p>
<p>紛匯鉅款</p>
<p>接濟國內</p>
<p>各埠以新加坡，棉蘭，吧城，孟加錫，四埠為最繁盛、新加坡有華僑六十萬、棉藺三萬餘、新加坡當局對華僑尙自由、荷屬較嚴、對國貨進口、當地經濟部有限制、惟於某種情形下、可請求特別通融、英屬及荷屬政府、亦甚同情中國抗戰、尙無過分壓制華僑愛國行動事件發生、新加坡一埠、華僑輸金、已迖二千萬元、惟在當地則用「賬災會」名義募集、華僑每月所得薪工、亦扣成捐輸、潘氏反潘李兩君、尙須留滬若干時期、用以考察及計劃推銷國貨事業、</p>
<h3>滬西曹義小學事件　日意當局諒解　竟由日軍在校門張佈吿　傅日方禁阻至校外活動</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報雲、日意兵已置極斯非而路一〇八一號曹義小學於其控制下、以防續起糾紛、昨日（四日）午後、日意兵已在該校門上張貼通告、不准一人出入、聞諸可靠方面、因昨日午刻、複起糾紛、日意兵乃有此舉、緣星期四日晨、</p>
<p>意兵逮捕</p>
<p>持械恐怖分子後、同日午後二時、有「特務團總參謀」徐某者、相信糾紛已結束、而可用該屋為「特務團」辦事處、乃與其他數人、偕眷屬用卡車一載臥具等、入曹義小學、而</p>

<p>昨日午刻、該徐某手持武器、偕另一持械者出現該屋外、為意兵所見、立予逮捕、自星期四日午後起、遷入該屋之婦女、未見出外、而日方通吿不准、「出」入、表示若輩仍在屋內、官方雖未發表文告、惟日意當局似已</p>

<p>交渉釋出</p>
<p>諸人、但意當局尚未從之、昨晚消息靈通方面雖以為諸人或將開釋、或交日方、但本埠意海軍當局刻巳不負此舉之責任、蓋昨夜聞此案已交意大使館辦理、故已非軍事事件、而係政治事件矣、昨夜一般人甚至認為或將與意政府商榷之後、始將若輩與其所有之武器</p>
<p>移交日方</p>
<p>暗若輩是星期四日午前在極斯非而路一零八一號被意兵逮捕、而押往意兵司令部者、日意兵部與「大道政府」已提出開釋諸人之交涉、意海軍當局乃將此事轉報意大使館、又字林報云、據昨日所得消息、極斯非而路一零八一號曹義小學室屋由</p>

<h3>不許吃閒飯</h3>
<p>— 奮飛</p>
<p>小朋友！我希望你們不要吃「閒飯」，并且我們不許「吃閒飯」。</p>
<p>在國難嚴　的今天，我們每一個中國的同胞，是絕對不許「吃閒飯」的。生活要「生產化」，你看！江北的孩子，是在火傘高張的盛夏的時候，每個城內外的街路上，深深地印上他們生活的足跡，尤其在路角街中的垃圾桶旁邊，時時有成羣結隊的江北小孩子，背上負着筐子，或者手裏携着籃子，兩隻眼睛總是向着捅裏去探索，似乎那裏有什麼珍珠寶貝，但是我不以爲奇怪，困爲垃圾桶裏却有許多廢物，給他們拿去以後，便有用處，否則他們不是變做傻子嗎？他們因爲生活上的逼迨，於是老老小小，都有工作去做，像老太婆吧！他們跑出去替人家補衣補被；壯年的呢，會挑着糖担到街上去賣糖；老頭子，大多住在船上做雜事；小孩子，自三四歲到十七八歲，他們是出來「拾荒」，所以他人可以說是沒有人「吃閒飯」的，并且他們是不許「吃閒飯」。</p>
<p>江北人的苦幹的精神，是我們數見不鮮司空見慣的了，這是值得我們佩服的。他們不論在夏天冬天，大多赤着腳，更在盛夏，較小的孩子，竟是一絲不掛，誠然是裸體運動的創始者實行者，我們看了他們的臉兒，或者要看作有病的樣子，但是他們的皮膚是紅黑色，而且是結實的，雖然處在容易「生病」的境遇，細菌却仍不會侵入，抵抗力是很強大的，臉兒的黃，分明是營養的不足，紅黑分明是受太陽熏炙的結果，他們是不怕風霜雨露。我是常常看見四五歲光景的孩子（男女），總是赤足在地上走，同時，由大的孩子，領着到各處去「拾荒」，在飯前傍晚，是會看見他們負着極沉重的筐子，用繩縛在頸上，他們却並無痛苦，反正非常快活，回到家裏去（船上）吃飯。他們日常吃的東西，（人家丟在垃圾桶裏菜瓣菜根等）或者是向人家討來的殘羹殘肴，菜是不講究的，飯是吃飽的。「拾荒」是江北孩子唯一的工作。</p>
<p>諸位對於上面的事實，大約不會說我是謊話吧！試問你們的生活是何等的舒適！父母對於你們是如何的保護，一有什麼疾病，便手足都忙了，趕快去請醫生，這是固然幸運的，我們便應該知道，身體要健全，必須要鍛鍊，江北的孩子，就是我們的證據，現在閨房小姐也不致弱不禁風了！何況我們男孩子，便會脆弱得可憐！好在現在學校方面，早已注意運動了！或者孱弱是不會有的，不必顧慮了！對於生產方面是很少吧！我們在孤島上，不是看見有窮人家的小孩子，幹的是賣冰，賣報的小生意，同時，在逃　的時候，我也看見過有很多的小孩子，做賣香烟的勾當，這大半是爲了「生活」的驅使，走上「吃飯」的大道。我們對於小生意，是不應該輕視的，你看！愛迪生，墨索利尼……一類的偉人，他們都幹過這小生意，所以我們不怕「出身低」，只要「苦幹」就行了！我最後希望你們在暑假裏，去找工作來做，方是不「吃閒飯」。</p>
<h3>大家要起早</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>爲着多方面環境的關係，我們都住在都市裏，每天得不到一些新鮮空氣的調節，每天不能獲得寗靜的時光，每天吃煤灰，吞「凱司林」臭味，聽喧譁呌囂的聲浪……這已經算是很大的不幸。都市那及得鄉村呢，樹木多，空氣好，住戶稀，環境恬靜。這兩項是與人們極有益的。</p>
<p>有怎樣的益呢？一，空氣好，可使身體健旺，神志清醒，精力充足，對一切都勝任愉快。二，環境恬靜，可使讀書專心，注意力集中，思想明達，可是，在繁華的都市，是不會有這樣的享受的，除掉逛公園。只是有時亦爲受時間和經濟上的限制，沒有常去公園的機會。小朋友：當你們想讀些書的時候，也許隔壁人家的骨牌聲響會來向你們搗亂，當你們想寫字的時候，也許鄰近作塲裏馬達會震顫你們的手腕。尤其在這酷熱的季候，你們也許極度討厭那妨礙你們自修學業的種種紛擾，而認爲沒奈何。</p>
<p>這裏，我却有一個意見：在夏季，希望小朋友們能特別早起。養成早起的習慣。趁此天熱，我想起早是不會爲難的，起早習慣養成後，就把晏起的懶病打倒了。白天和夜晚的都市果然煤氣氤氳，烏烟繚繞，但清晨六七點鍾前要好得多，工廠高烟囱裏還沒冒烟，家家戶戶的炊烟亦未起，屋外沒有行人車馬的喧鬧。屋內也沒有骨牌聲和熱閙的人聲。這樣，推開窗來，空氣比較新鮮，坐在窗前讀書是好不過的，怕吵醒別人的話，書聲不妨放輕些，況且大人們見你們肯用功，即使被閙醒，也不會責備。此外，寫字，演算題，造句作文繪畫……甚麼都極其適宜，都容易領悟，容易深入腦海。</p>
<p>在清晨，對於任何工作的效力，都要比別的時候進步。古人有一句話：「早起三日當一工，」就是告訴人們，在清晨氣清人靜，全神貫注，往往事半功倍。小朋友：假使你們要用功，那麼就得大家起早。寗可早睡，不可晏起。能這樣，不必定要羨慕鄉村的。</p>
<h3>屯溪的前瞻</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>明兒避難記之二十八</p>
<p>江山船浮過了清麗的富春江，蕩遍了樸素的新安江。明兒的一羣逃難人度了十多日漫長的船上生活，青山綠水，茅屋田舍，大城小鎮，他們差不多全都耳聞目見了。這對於明兒倒增進了不少活的智識，可是他們所付的代價也很可觀的了。</p>
<p>在船自杭出發的第十二日中午時候，明兒盛了碗飯在船頭上吃得津津有味。</p>
<p>「今天傍晚可以到達屯溪了。」明兒一聽到屯溪三個了，心中很是欣喜，因爲明兒在船上的生活，度得有些厭倦了，於是他曾有好幾次問船老大還有多少日子可以到目的地，他終是不肯定的說，因爲他們是靠天吃飯，順風順水和逆風逆水的快和慢相差得很大，而天的變化是難能測算的。可是到了今天，他便很有把握的向明兒說着。</p>
<p>「今天可以到了嗎？已有十多天，可算是慢的了。」明兒帶着欣悅而有些責怪的口吻說道。</p>
<p>「到今天不過十二天，已是快的了。有一回，我們自杭州到屯溪，足足有二十天，因爲水又淺，天天打着逆風，那真是費力。」</p>
<p>明兒眼見得如一條帶般的房屋，橫列在茫茫的河的盡頭處。這時在河岸的兩邊，時時可以見到一座座的，堡壘它像座石屋兀立着一個個的方孔點綴在滿長着草的石壁上，表示它已飽經風霜雨雪，顯出一副英凜的氣概。後來明兒才知道它是在太平天國的時候，地方上的鄉民利用它來抵禦外來的強盜的打刦。</p>
<p>「那邊便是屯溪了。」「屯溪熱鬧不熱鬧？」明兒這句話，是有作用的，因爲他自杭州上船後，經過的市鎮是很多了，但他所上岸的市鎮，終使他失望的回船，因爲那邊是冷落得很，高低不平的石板路，低窮的市屋寥寥無幾的商店，而顧客也很少光顧，商業當然也冷落得可憐，和明兒故鄉的鬧市一比，真有天壤之別了。他又在船中度上這麼長而無聊的生活，精神方面不免是很煩悶，他因此極需要調劑一下，如今聽得「屯溪快到了」，便急忙提出這個問題。</p>
<p>「屯溪真熱鬧，什麼東西都有。街又闊，店又多，黃包車，腳踏車，汽車在滿街的來來往往，還有別的玩意兒。除了杭州外，屯溪也不算不熱鬧的了，所以有許多人呌它「小上海」真的一些兒也不錯。」船老大一面說着，一面追想起他從前到屯溪後一切印象。</p>
<p>明兒聽得船老大誇稱屯溪怎樣的熱鬧，怎樣的好玩，這倒使他心花怒放，頓時現出笑容來，希望早一些到屯溪才好玩一個暢快。</p>
<p>但是他們望雖是望到了，可是他問問船老大還有十多里路哩，他愈是心急，而船反愈是行得慢了。河面也漸漸地狹了許多，而倒比以前更曲折了，船真像一個虫在光滑的蛇身上蜿蜒的爬去。太陽也不停的向西移去，明兒呆立在船頭上，睜大了眼望着，屋子是近得多了，在那棵大樹邊的林立的桅桿，真如雨後春筍般的一根根矗立在天際，一頭奮翅的餓鷹，打着旋子在找尋它們的目的物。</p>
<p>在天色黑下來的時候，他們才到達了屯溪。</p>
<h3>暑假期中的小木工　小小跳舞家</h3>
<p>— 新生</p>
<p>小朋友，我想你們在悠長的暑假期中除了溫習舊有的課本，準備下半年的新書之外，一定可以有空暇的時間來作這一件小木工的；一則製作簡易藉此可以練習手工技術，二則製就後可作種種的遊戲。</p>
<p>其製作時所需之工具，材料，以及製作的方法如下：</p>
<p>工具：小刀或小　子</p>
<p>材料：三夾板（工三吋半，闊二吋半）一方，一小塊三塊，漆（各色），膠水，小釘，</p>
<p>製法：先將三夾板依第一圖，把那小跳舞家的面部，體軀，手肢等部繪上去，再用小刀或小　子把它切刻下來，成爲一個人形，然後再以彩色漆分繪漆其頭部之髪及五官等，衣服之顏色可繪成各種圖案花樣，或以花布樣剪成，膠粘於木片上；如厭油漆繪製費事，或無彩漆則可改以圖畫紙一張，將人形繪其上，施以彩色，然後膠在木板上，再將其切刻即成，在人形製就後，另以長木塊一，用小刀削成一圓形之執柄（如附圖二）而將其膠於（一）之前後（如附圖三）如厭削製麻煩則可以一長狹之木條，用小釘釘在其上以代之，但在夾執時，手指間不若圓柄之舒適，此外再以小形木塊兩塊（各長一吋，高半吋闊四分之三吋），照附圖四用小刀削成一隻小木鞋，鞋口之大小須依各人的食指和中指之大小而挖空之，以便將其套穿於手指中，木鞋施以油漆或以顏色墨水塗染之，如是則工作全部完成矣。</p>
<p>至於戲玩的方法：以右手或左手之中指及食指將人形背面的執柄夾住，而將一雙木鞋分別套於指尖，即可以作各種方式的跳躍遊戲，如集姊妹小朋友等同玩，更爲有味！</p>
<h3>畜生道中（十二）</h3>
<p>— 心青</p>
<p>一頭老雌貓怒呼道：「不用多說廢話了！彭其那廝殘酷非常，犯了種種非人的暴行，如今沒有別的話說，只有照樣的一一回報在他身上。哼，他是一個孩子，我說，他是一個正正式式的孩子！」</p>
<p>一　，閣，閣！那老公蛙又呌起來了，它似乎也在考慮着這一個案件。</p>
<p>獅子很溫和的向大眾說道：「同類們，我們也不必再聽那些反對犯人的證詞了。他的暴行，早已有事實證明，即使他將虐待貓兄們的一回事，推在勒夫先生身上，也沒有用。現在所要決定的，是怎樣的處罰他。可是你們既已將裁判之權，交在我的手中，那麼我就得要求你們平心靜氣地等着，等我繞行三個圈兒，好好地考慮一下」。</p>
<p>但那獅子繞行了三圈，還是不能決定，於是放大了腳步，一連繞了七個圈兒，不斷的揮動着它的尾巴。最後它才回到原座上，很着力的坐了下來；那老公蛙抬起了它那綠色的頭，等候獅子的裁判。</p>
<p>獅子莊重地說道：「諸位獸類，鳥類，魚類，我對於這一件案子，已經過了一番嚴密的考慮，料想我的決定，決不會引起你們的反感的。我們的朋友雌貓太太，曾經說應當把這犯人以前虐待貓兒們的手段，回報在他的身上。</p>

<h3>滇戲雜記（昆明通訊）</h3>
<p>— 聊止</p>
<p>滇戲之結構唱白以及音樂上之配合等事，與京劇頗多相似，且所演各劇，亦多為京劇所有者，如三娘教子，女斬子，珠簾案，戰馬謖等皆與京劇所言，情文一致，其歌唱之聲調，則與京劇漢調粵曲，亦均有相似之處，聽之頗覺悠揚悅耳；其作工表情，亦復認真不茍，在吾國各地戲劇中，實應佔一優越之地位。惜以向來只在滇省演唱，迄無人至港澳等地，組班出演，故國人欲觀賞滇戲，非身臨滇省不可，此滇戲之所以不甚為國人所熟知也。</p>
<p>滇戲亦有西皮二簧之分，其板眼之拍法，亦與京劇相似，惟字膏與說白，純用滇語音調，此則地方色彩之特徵也。</p>
<p>雲南譚信培</p>
<p>現今滇戲泰斗，為粟成之風負之譽，年逾六旬，不常登台。某夕經各界特煩在新滇舞台，演女斬子一劇，與會趨往一觀此劇唱白不甚多，而粟伶藝業之精醇老到，已可窺見一斑，扮像極清秀，頗似譚氏晚年，作工亦殊細緻，迥異俗伶，因信其實至名歸，自非偶然。又有老伶名竹八音者，唱青衣，其地位亦與京劇界已故之陳德霖（石頭）相當，近亦不常出演，前月會度在新滇登台，惜以事　　，未獲一聆究竟也。</p>
<p>昆明茶館中，多有滇戲演唱，以金碧路之太華春為最有名。其中角色，尤以為　楚。</p>
<p>女伶小蘭春</p>
<p>小蘭春唱老生，豪爽俊朗，頗具巾幗鬚眉之氣概。會聽其珠窟塞，扮陳敬思，（滇劇之珠窟塞，以陳敬思為主角，李克用則以花臉扮演，居配角地位）及斬宗保，（即京劇之轅門斬子，）兩劇，唱工均極動聽，其人　長白皙，有玉立亭亭之致，裝飾亦頗入時，不類滇中一班之婦女，在未聽其唱白之先，不知其為滇人也。</p>
<p>前夕又偕友輩至太華聆玉堂春，與卓放曹兩劇，詞句唱腔，幾與京劇大致相同，友人亦疑滇戲必係舊都伶工所傳授，故一切均大同小異。滇省在歷史上有幾次大規模之移民，如清初吳三桂入滇，隨行者多燕人，其中殆有人隸梨園籍。</p>
<p>滇劇之來源</p>
<p>或即以此，惜一時未得深考耳。滇省金融業巨　繆　台氏，速嗜京劇，於滇戲尤稱精譜，且能歌唱，惟不肯輕易一露。某日，諸名流宴集，繆亦在座，眾請繆作歌，穋讓遜不遑，眾固請，繆謂俟我暢飲，當勉為一試。然酒後始終未唱也。</p>
<p>滇劇之場面，（即音樂之組合，）與京劇尤多相類，惟每　皆擎［堂鼓］以為節奏，斯則與京劇迥異之一點耳。</p>
<h3>［保家鄉］在渝獻映　主演英茵流血療治記</h3>
<p>— 慧存</p>
<p>攝片時表演認真刀傷血管</p>
<p>大量觀眾紛紛寄投慰勞信</p>
<p>英茵在今日中國的女劇人中，可以說是最優秀的一個。我們不會忘記往年業餘劇團公演的［武則天］裏，她飾演武則天的卓越演出，是給一般劇迷留下了深刻的印象。</p>
<p>她今年是二十二歲，小時候在北平讀過書，所以她從小就說得一口流利的國語，後來又在南昌某女學校肄業。據說，她父親是滿洲人，而母親却是廣東人。戰前，她是業餘劇團的基本演員，同時也會在銀幕上露過臉。</p>
<p>八一三戰事發生，她隨着業餘劇團前往內地從事演劇工作，當漢口後，為了工作的艱苦而生了病，她也就北平回上海，可是，當她復原之後，她又轉道香港而至內地，最後又由漢而至重慶。那時業餘劇團已告解散，她便由有人潘君的介紹而加入［中電］為演員，後又退出［中電］，加入［中製］。不時她還參加重慶影劇人的話劇演出。她到重慶後第一次在舞台上露臉的是［阿Q正傳］，之後，她演過［總動員　民族光榮］民族萬歲］［一週間」等戲，她的演技是相當熟練，深刻。而給觀眾一致讚美的。</p>
<p>她加入「中製］所演的第一部片，就是何非光導演的農村教育救國聲片「保家鄉」。當攝製該片時，有一個英茵與日本軍官刦刀爭奪的鏡玥，大概是爭奪得太厲害了。飾演日本軍官的　的動了刀，竞割破了她的血管。於是假戲真做，英茵就在醫院裹住了一個時期。</p>
<p>當這部「保家鄉」攝竣後，上月在重慶碩果僅存的「唯影戲院］放映時，而該片主角英茵却仍在醫院療傷。一般觀眾得知了這個消息，都紛紛寫慰勞信給她，因為，她在銀幕上演出的迫真，是使一般觀眾深切的感動了。所以，她在醫院中每天要收到不少的慰勞信，此外，還有人是寄給報館代寫發表的。</p>
<p>雖然，慰勞信在目前是十分盛行着的，可是以一個女劇人兼影人而獲得大量的慰勞信，恐怕她還是第一個吧！</p>
<h3>閒畫游藝界</h3>
<p>— 凍雲撰文　岫烟製圖</p>
<p>（十二）粵劇</p>
<p>因為方言的隔膜，這純粹南國情調的粵劇，不能像其他［地方戲劇］一樣普遍流行。唱詞方面，雖然有許多生硬字義，費人所解；但就大體上說起來，很夠得上［典雅不俗］的考語．有幾支戲詞，幾乎可以代表廣大方面的［文學］。</p>
<p>所惜運腔使調，總不免有一點［硬繃繃］之感！</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>今昔邀角之不同</p>
<p>大概此單人坐的地方，總是在對準下場門的台口，從前舊式茶園（戲館，多名茶園子）都是在台前擺列着八仙桌兒，一排也許能擺五張桌子，至多可以列成五六排，這些都名之曰池座。池座後邊及左右兩邊也許再排上幾條長凳子，如其地面狹小，即於池座周圍隔以欄杆，欄杆外皆賣站粟，亦有幾調之曰仙鶴座者。大凡坐有池座中者，類系地方紳續富戶或商號大老闆與官場中人，伏几正坐，而對台上者又較同來諸人中之坐於桌案兩旁及脊背倚几而坐者地位為尊。是故凡勾角人與其夥伴偕入茶園時，亦故意扮作富商模樣，坐在桌之正中，其隨來之一二人則分坐兩旁，舊式戲館池座內最多可容三四人，所以角兒在台上演唱，對於某座中發出叫好的聲音時，台上人全能辨認得很清楚，勾角人對於他目的中角兒，自然要常時報以彩聲，藉促其對已注意，自己本來坐在下場門的台口，（大凡會聽戲的人。都揀下場門的台口坐。）要是逢到角兒唱下句進後台時，例必反過身來，立在台口，唱一下句之散板，然後進場；此際台上人與勾角人僅相隔咫尺，一切動作言語皆可自台下達於角兒之前也。</p>
<p>凡人都有個［登此山又望彼山高］的心理，一個名角在原來的地方待得久啦，未免就想換個碼頭玩玩，況其座兒賣的好，自覺這是奇功一件，不但是要向園主長包銀，並且心性脾氣也就不由的大了許多。</p>

<h3>Hunanese Troops Gain More Ground; Capture Minggang, Xiaolindian, Sanguanmiao; Chinese Army Pursues Victory, Reaches Changtaiguan, Encircles Defeated Japanese Troops; Changzhi in Eastern Shanxi Also Recaptured, Japanese Troops Retreating Towards Liangma</h3>
<p>(Luoyang) Frontline telephone report: After the recapture of Minggang, the Chinese army pursued the victory. On the morning of the 4th, they captured Sanguanmiao and swept towards Changtaiguan from "south of Minggang." The Japanese troops at Wushengguan, in order to coordinate with the northern front, occupied Gaocheng, north of Suixian, on the afternoon of the 4th, and a part besieged Lishan. The Chinese army has already launched counterattacks along different routes. (5th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) The war situation in southern Henan: Since the Chinese forces completed their deployment and launched a full-scale offensive, they have been winning victories. On the 2nd, the Chinese army attacked Minggang, where fierce hand-to-hand combat occurred near the railway station. On the morning of the 3rd, the Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attacks and retreated in a disorganized manner towards Changtaiguan. The Chinese army immediately recaptured Minggang. The citizens saw the national flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun flying in the sky again, and they rejoiced along the streets, like children returning to the embrace of their loving mother. While comforting the people, the Chinese army pursued the retreating Japanese troops. The Japanese troops stationed at Xiaochengtian (west of Xinyang) were forced to retreat to Zhe River (east of Xiaolindian) after a determined attack by the Chinese army. At this moment, there were no Japanese troops in Xiaolindian. However, the Japanese troops previously defeated by the Chinese army at Huaihedian had retreated east and west in two directions. The 3,000 to 4,000 Japanese troops retreating west had crossed the Sandao River (northeast of Gaocheng in Suixian) and their vanguard had reached Xinshuiguan and Yinjiadian (both northeast of Gaocheng in Suixian). Another unit had reached Jiuligang (northwest of Gaocheng). It seems that the Japanese troops were attempting to detour around the side of Tongbai Mountain, and the Chinese army has taken strict precautions. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, Minggang Station on the Pinghan Railway in southern Henan has been recaptured after fierce fighting between Chinese and Japanese forces yesterday. The Japanese troops retreated towards Changtaiguan, and the Chinese army has now advanced to Changtaiguan and surrounded the Japanese troops. At the same time, a large part of the city walls west of the Pinghan Railway has also been recaptured by the Chinese army. With this victory, the Japanese plan to capture southern Henan has been shattered. On the southern front of Shanxi Province, as a result of the Chinese army's continued counterattacks, Jincheng has been surrounded. It is reported that there are 2,000 Japanese soldiers guarding Jincheng. If Jincheng returns to the hands of the Chinese army, it can be said that the Japanese army's offensive against the Taihang Mountains will be a complete failure, because the Japanese troops north of Jincheng have all withdrawn north after the Chinese army recaptured more than a dozen important towns, so the Japanese troops in Jincheng have become isolated. At the same time, the Japanese troops on the Gaoping-Duanshi Highway have also been completely cleared. In Anhui Province, although Huaiyuan was recaptured by the Chinese forces in the middle of last week, after a fierce counterattack by the Japanese cavalry and artillery, the Chinese army retreated again. (5th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: Recently, the Japanese troops launched fierce attacks on Chinese positions such as Qilitang, and the battle situation was extremely fierce. Two platoons of Chinese soldiers guarding Qilitang died heroically, and more than 100 Japanese soldiers were also killed or wounded. For the past three days, fierce battles have been raging in the mountains near Bijiashan, Qilitang, and Gaocheng. On the 4th, more than 400 Japanese troops attempted to encircle the Chinese positions by detouring around the above-mentioned areas. The Chinese army is determined to sacrifice themselves and has not wavered, repeatedly inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese. Another Japanese force that attacked Lishan from Suixian was intercepted by the Chinese army in the Sujiafu area on the left flank of Lishan. The Jiangjiahe market town has been lost and regained twice and is currently still under Chinese guard. (5th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) Since the war in southern Shanxi turned to eastern Shanxi, both Chinese and Japanese forces have been actively deploying. The Japanese army plans to harass Licheng, but has not yet launched an attack. The Chinese army took preemptive action with a night attack on the 1st against the garrison of over a thousand Japanese soldiers at Huguan. The Japanese were caught off guard and many were killed by the Chinese army. The Chinese army destroyed the Japanese fortifications and returned to their original defenses at dawn. Huguan is only thirty miles away from Changzhi. After this attack, the Japanese troops were all terrified. On the morning of the 1st, a unit of the Chinese army launched a swift attack on Changzhi, a Japanese base. The Japanese troops stubbornly resisted, and bullets rained down. The brave Chinese soldiers gave their lives and charged forward with all their might. The fierce battle lasted all day, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese army finally braved the dense artillery fire and broke into the city walls. Without any street fighting, the Japanese troops collapsed to the east. Thus, Changzhi, an important stronghold in eastern Shanxi, was once again in the hands of the Chinese army. In addition, the Japanese troops at various strongholds along the Hongtun Highway have been shaken by the continuous attacks from the north and south by the Chinese army. On the 31st, a unit of 700 to 800 Japanese troops from Tunliu retreated west through Liangma (west of Tunliu), and all the Japanese troops from Zhangdian Town (west of Tunliu) also retreated to Liangma. The Japanese army's attempt to maintain traffic on the Hongtun Highway has failed, and their attempt to open a route from Linfen to Dongyangguan is even more impossible. (5th dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Consul to Lodge Strong Protest Against Anti-British Movement in Tianjin; Britain Does Not Intend to Directly Protect British Nationals Outside the Concession</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) British Consul-General Jameson is preparing to lodge a strong protest with the Japanese authorities regarding the attack by Chinese mobs on the British-owned Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and Butterfield &amp; Swire yesterday. It is reported that the British authorities do not intend to take unilateral measures to protect the lives and property of British nationals outside the British Concession, but will delegate the responsibility for protection to the Japanese. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yesterday, a serious anti-British movement occurred in the former Belgian Concession, Special District Four. Suddenly, 200 Chinese attacked the staff dormitories and offices of the International Export Company, the largest British trading company in Tianjin. The company's staff, including one British woman, took refuge in the Texaco oil station. When they returned to the office an hour later, they found that all the furniture had been smashed and the doors and windows had been broken. The foreign staff's dining room also suffered the same fate. It is said that the greatest loss was suffered by the Chinese staff's offices. However, the rioters did not interfere with the company's factory. Major Dilreman of the British garrison received the news one hour after the riot began and immediately notified the Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters by telephone. The headquarters promised to send police to suppress the riot. The Japanese side then telephoned Dilreman, saying that some Chinese were holding a peaceful demonstration and wanted to hand over one or two items to the manager of the International Export Company, and said that any attempt to riot would be severely suppressed. It is reported that before attacking the International Export Company, the rioters went to the nearby Butterfield &amp; Swire branch office, threatened the Chinese staff, smashed doors and windows, and slightly damaged furniture and equipment before leaving. The local authorities did not prohibit the activities of the rioters. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>American Nationals in Kaifeng Also Threatened</h3>
<p>(Hankou) According to reliable foreign telegrams received here today, anti-British elements in Kaifeng are posing a serious threat to the lives and property of American nationals. The telegram predicts that American nationals in Kaifeng will soon be forced to withdraw. Regarding this matter, the American consulate authorities have lodged a strong protest with the Japanese authorities. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Encouraging Youths to Apply for National Universities</h3>
<p>The unified entrance examination for national universities this year will be held simultaneously in fifteen districts across the country starting tomorrow. Shanghai is only one of the fifteen districts, but the number of applicants has already reached several thousand. Some of these youths applying for the examination have families originally in Shanghai, and some have families in various occupied areas. All of them have come to Shanghai specifically to take the examination. A total of twenty-three universities are participating in this unified entrance examination. Only four and a half of them are in Shanghai (the Tangshan Engineering College of Jiaotong University is not in Shanghai). Eighteen and a half universities were originally in the interior or moved to the interior from Shanghai and other occupied cities. Moreover, those that remain in Shanghai are mostly independent colleges, with fewer complete universities, smaller scales, and fewer places available. The opposite is true in the interior. Therefore, in fact, these many examinees not only have a deep belief in national schools, but most of them are also preparing to study in the interior. These young people are not satisfied with their own knowledge and skills, and they aspire to further their studies. Given that transportation between Shanghai and the interior is extremely inconvenient at this time, they are not afraid of the obstacles and dangers of the journey, and they are willing to leave their hometowns and travel thousands of miles to study. Such a spirit of enthusiasm for learning is truly admirable! However, it would be too superficial, too ordinary, and too lacking in understanding of their true intentions to simply praise these enthusiastic young people from this point of view. What day is it today? What place is this? Who among the residents of Shanghai and the occupied areas does not lament the plight of their situation? Who does not wish to change their original intention of loyalty to their country and nation? And who does not wish to find a suitable opportunity to contribute their body and mind? Young people are the most sensitive and have the furthest vision. Why do they want to go to the interior? It is nothing more than that they can breathe the air of freedom and pursue a bright future in the interior. Therefore, rather than saying that their application is solely for the sake of their desire to study, it is better to say that they are determined to escape the turbid atmosphere and embrace the light. As for their parents, they would rather sacrifice the beautiful dream of having their children by their side and let their children go to the interior to seek a bright future, while also expressing their own sincerity and transporting the most needed human resources for the country and nation to the interior. The significance of this is many times greater than any material contribution such as donating money or ships. Therefore, when we see such an enthusiastic response from students in the Shanghai area, we cannot help but rejoice for the future of China. At the same time, we express our infinite respect to the aspiring youths and wise parents!</p>
<p>The unified entrance examination for national universities is organized by the Ministry of Education, which has the authority to weigh the number of people to be admitted, and it must have a very thorough plan in advance, which we do not need to discuss much. However, based on the needs of the Shanghai area, we feel that if the facts allow, it is best to ask the organizers to slightly increase the number of admissions in the Shanghai area. Why is there such a need? The first reason is because Shanghai has a special environment. As mentioned earlier, most of the young people applying for the examination in the Shanghai area are dissatisfied with the current environment and intend to seek light in the interior. Then the country should fully give them the opportunity to satisfy their desires. Moreover, Shanghai and its surrounding areas have always been the most important areas in the country in terms of economy, culture, and other aspects. The quality of the young people in this area is fundamentally excellent, and the enslavement education implemented by the Japanese and puppet authorities in the occupied areas, as well as the covetousness of the villains and traitors in the special area of Shanghai for culture and education, are all aimed at absorbing these outstanding young people. Although we firmly believe that the young people will never be willing to be anesthetized, and will never fail to distinguish between right and wrong, in order to preserve the vitality of the nation, maintain outstanding strength, and resist the dark forces, it is very necessary to import a large number of young people from the Shanghai area into the interior. The second reason is because the area covered by the Shanghai examination area is too large. Among the fifteen examination areas this time, Sichuan Province accounts for two, Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces each account for one, and Shanghai also accounts for one. Although Shanghai is only one of the fifteen districts on the surface, in fact, the current Shanghai has become the general hub of transportation along the coast and rivers, as well as most of the other occupied areas, that is, the general gateway from the occupied areas to the interior. Therefore, the area covered by the Shanghai examination area is actually much larger than any other area, so the number of applicants is bound to be very large. From the perspective of quantity ratio, the number of admissions should also be increased a little compared to other examination areas.</p>
<p>However, even if the number of admissions is indeed increased a little, the number of people who can actually be admitted will certainly be a minority. The young people who are admitted will certainly be able to develop their ambitions and add great strength to the rear areas of the war of resistance and national reconstruction; the majority of the others who are not admitted may feel infinite disappointment in their hearts. But we believe that although their experience is unfortunate, they need not be discouraged. Because since Shanghai became an isolated island, young people have certainly clamored loudly to go to the interior, but staying in Shanghai is not entirely without meaning. Of course, they don't have to adopt a passive attitude of hiding their talents and waiting for the time to come, nor do they have to live a life of indulgence that drifts with the tide, because in fact there are many important jobs that need young people to actively do. As long as young people can use their steadfast spirit and stand on their respective posts to work hard, their loyalty to the country and nation is no different from going to the interior, and the fields that can be opened up in their work can be said to be readily available. Moreover, in the current isolated island society shrouded in darkness, it is precisely pure and clean young people who are needed to be the core of society. The famous saying of Mr. Gu Tinglin, "Pine and cypress wither later in the cold season, and the rooster crows unceasingly in the wind and rain," can be transferred to young people who have the heart but not the power to go to the interior.</p>
<h3>United Efforts by Britain, the United States, and France to Stabilize China's Legal Tender; Morgenthau Conducting Negotiations in Britain; U.S. Government Preparing to Extend Loans to China</h3>
<p>(London) U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau is about to arrive in this city. Although this trip is of an informal nature, he will take the opportunity to discuss with representatives of the British Treasury the positions of Britain and the United States in China, especially the issue of stabilizing China's legal tender. It is reported that Britain and France recently contacted the U.S. government, proposing that Britain, France, and the United States work together to stabilize China's legal tender and requesting the United States to allocate funds to replenish the Exchange Equalization Fund. It is said that the U.S. government replied that it was willing to take parallel actions with Britain and France, but did not intend to act simultaneously. Not long after, the U.S. government announced the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, which shows that the U.S.'s parallel action has already been put into practice. Regarding the issue of Chinese silver deposits in the Tianjin Concession, Chamberlain has decided that it cannot be resolved by Britain and Japan alone and that the opinions of the U.S. and French governments must be sought. The negotiations in Tokyo may therefore be temporarily suspended, which is not certain. In this regard, Britain's reply to Japan will largely depend on how the general situation in Europe and the Far East develops, that is, it will depend on whether Japan joins the military alliance treaty between Germany and Italy. Regarding the issue of Japan joining the military alliance treaty between Germany and Italy, London has not yet received any credible information. If this is true, then Britain will immediately believe that it must deal with Japan with a more forceful attitude. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau will also formulate methods to assist China with Sir Leith-Ross, the economic advisor to the British government, which can be said with certainty.

<p>(Washington) The financial and economic situation of China was recently commented on by people close to the State Department, who said that it is extremely delicate in nature. Japan is planning to revive the occupied areas of China economically as a long-term plan and is forcibly using new currency as the sole medium of exchange in those areas. Foreign merchants refuse to recognize this currency and therefore cannot engage in commerce in the occupied areas. Therefore, American interests are directly threatened. The government has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese government, and at the same time, it will continue to purchase Chinese silver and extend credit to China. After Congress adjourns, the government will once again launch an initiative to demonstrate to Japan the U.S.'s determination to protect its interests in the Far East. (4th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Government Statement to Britain Regarding Ownership of Silver in Tianjin; Guo Taiqi Visits British Foreign Office; French Attitude Consistent with Britain</h3>
<p>(London) Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi met with Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Meng Sui this afternoon. It is reported that the Chinese government is concerned about the issue of Chinese silver deposits in the British and French concessions in Tianjin. During a meeting of the House of Commons today, a Member of Parliament asked whether the government had requested the Japanese side to stop the blockade of the British concession in Tianjin, since the British-Japanese plan had already been established. Foreign Secretary Butler replied that Sir Craigie, the ambassador to Japan, is currently continuing to urge the Japanese side to lift all restrictions. According to informed sources in Paris, the British government previously consulted the French side on the issue of Chinese silver in the British and French concessions in Tianjin. The French government has now replied, saying that the interests of Britain and France are linked and that France will take the same attitude as Britain on this matter. It is generally believed that the French government has notified the Japanese side of its attitude. (4th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Chinese government notified the British government yesterday, stating that as the owner of the silver stored in the British concession in Tianjin, it requests that Britain consult with the Chongqing government before deciding on the conditions proposed by Japan for the custody of the silver. Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi solemnly stated when he visited British Foreign Secretary Mousse yesterday that Britain has the necessity to discuss the Tianjin silver issue with China and other relevant powers. Britain has exchanged views with the United States and France on the issue of disposing of the silver, but has not yet discussed the issue of the ownership of the silver.

<h3>China and Britain to Discuss China's Currency System in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Informed sources here believe that the rumors circulating among the Chinese that a Sino-British conference will be held in Hong Kong soon to discuss China's currency system and the Exchange Equalization Fund are not yet ripe. There are no arrangements for such a conference to be held in the next half month. According to Chinese sources, Song Ziwen and Bei Zuyi will attend this conference on the Chinese side, and Rogers, a member of the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, will attend on the British side.

<h3>Imprisoned Indian in Hankou Regains Freedom</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Mr. Singh, an Indian who was kidnapped from the Asia Oil Company gas station by several Chinese two weeks ago, has now regained his freedom. According to Mr. Singh, who spoke to visiting reporters, after he was kidnapped, he was held in various houses near the Shantou station, and he was moved every time. His eyes were wrapped in cloth so that he could not see anything. Sometimes, people wearing Chinese clothes interrogated him and ordered him to write a confession and sign his name on it, admitting that the British and Chinese staff of the Asia Oil Company had represented the Chinese in purchasing military supplies. He immediately refused. At about 10:00 p.m. on August 2, someone suddenly put a cloth bag over his head, tied his hands together, and took him to the wilderness in a car, saying that if he did not confess, he would be executed. While they were arguing, another car drove up. When everyone saw this, they all fled. The person who came shouted his name, claiming that he had come to rescue him, and took him to the Japanese Gendarmerie headquarters, where he was treated very well and taken to the Asia Oil Company gas station in a car.

<h3>Craigie's Request for Instructions Not Yet Replied To; Negotiations in Tokyo Temporarily Suspended; British Foreign Secretary's Statement Provokes Japanese Resentment</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Japan Times, the main principles for maintaining peace and order in Tianjin have been negotiated between representatives of the British and Japanese governments in Tokyo. The British representative is Herbert, the consul in Tianjin, and the Japanese representative is Tanaka, the consul in Tianjin. The newspaper also said that the current agreement being negotiated is preparing to draft a written agreement to be exchanged between the two governments. Regarding economic issues, the British ambassador has not yet received any instructions from the British government. (5th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that British Ambassador Craigie visited Kato, the chief Japanese representative at the round table conference last night, and explained to him that the instructions from London had not yet arrived. This instruction is related to the report of the economic and police subcommittees sent to London on August 1. Kato then invited Muto and Miyamoto, representatives of the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:10 p.m. to report on Craigie's visit and discussed future procedures related to the conference. According to observers, Craigie will be able to receive British instructions on economic and police issues in Tianjin around August 7, at which time the conference will be held again. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Representatives of the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin, who are participating in the Anglo-Japanese conference in Tokyo, openly stated that they have had unpleasant feelings about the remarks made by British Foreign Secretary Halifax in the Upper House, believing that the agreement reached by Craigie and Tanaka has been destroyed, and said that the British government's delay in issuing instructions to Craigie is aimed at delaying the matter. If such methods are not changed, the Japanese army in North China will have to take action to protect its security. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Japanese Times today, Herbert, the British Consul in Tianjin, and Tanaka, the Japanese Consul in Tianjin, held an informal meeting from 4:30 p.m. to 6:10 p.m. on Friday, and the preparatory steps for the agreement between the two countries have been completed. This agreement contains the following points: (1) The Tianjin British Concession Police Department will hand over the four suspects in the assassination of Cheng to the Japanese side; (2) The Japanese side will cooperate with the Tianjin Municipal Council to arrest anti-Japanese elements, communists, and general criminals in the British Concession; (3) In order to achieve this goal, a liaison department must be established; (4) Strict control of anti-Japanese publications, education, and other similar activities in the British Concession; (5) Dismissal of anti-Japanese police officers in the British Concession; (6) The Tianjin British Concession Municipal Council Police Department must appoint Japanese police officers; (7) The Tianjin British Concession Municipal Council will appoint Japanese advisors. However, although the two sides have generally agreed on this police agreement, British Ambassador to Japan Craigie has not received instructions from his government on economic issues, so the negotiations have reached a deadlock. According to the Japan Times, if the British side deliberately delays the conference, the Japanese government will require the British side to give a reply with a limited date.

<h3>Yesterday Morning, Japanese Planes Again Attacked Chongqing, Bombed the Western Part of the City for One and a Half Hours, Significant Damage Occurred in the Jialing River South Bank Area, Even the Belgian Embassy Building Was Hit by Shrapnel</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) This morning, Chongqing was again bombed by Japanese planes. This bombing was the fourth in five days. Foreign consulates suffered severe damage again. A missionary's residence was destroyed. Around 1:00 AM this morning, 18 Japanese planes invaded Chongqing, bombing the western district of Chongqing and the area along the Yangtze River north of the city for one and a half hours. The Japanese planes flew over Chongqing in small formations. After Chinese anti-aircraft teams used searchlights to locate the enemy planes, they fired anti-aircraft guns at them. A 500-pound bomb exploded at the Belgian Embassy. Six Americans and five other foreigners who had taken refuge in the Belgian Embassy's air-raid shelter were greatly shocked. The windows of the Belgian Embassy were shattered, and the plaster on the walls fell. The plaster on the walls of the residence of the American Methodist missionary, Mr. Lei Pu, half a mile from the embassy, was also knocked down. The bomb also damaged more than twenty large residences near the embassy, destroyed four cars, and caused a wall to collapse into the ground, behind which many Chinese civilians were taking refuge. After hearing the sound of the wall collapsing and the cries of civilians, Mr. Liang, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Belgian Embassy, and Mr. Li Naer of the Sino-Belgian Bank immediately led a Chinese rescue team to provide assistance. The two Belgians, wearing white linen clothes and using wooden staffs, helped the rescue team to pull the injured out from under the collapsed wall. (Reuter, 5th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) During the Japanese bombing here this morning, a bomb landed near the Belgian Embassy, causing considerable panic among the American journalists who had taken refuge in the Belgian Embassy's air-raid shelter. Although none were seriously injured, all suffered minor abrasions. Initially, everyone thought the entrance of the air-raid shelter had been sealed, but later they realized it had not, which greatly relieved them. Among the American journalists taking refuge in the Belgian Embassy's air-raid shelter were Mr. Bao Ting, a reporter from the New York Times, and his wife, the American writer, Mr. Snow, Mr. Huai De, a researcher at Harvard-Yenching, and Ms. Peng Fei'er, a former Reuter reporter now working as a correspondent for a British newspaper. In addition, there were two French journalists. The foreign journalists and writers tried to carry the injured Chinese into the embassy building and gave wine to those who were unconscious from the crush to revive them. At the same time, Zhu Jiahua, Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee, Huang Renlin, Director-General of the New Life Movement, and Mr. Shitingni, the German head of Chiang Kai-shek's bodyguard, also assisted in the emergency rescue work. The Japanese planes were able to take advantage of the bright moonlight during this attack. Also, the duration of the recent Japanese bombings has been longer than in the past. Therefore, many people believe that these Japanese planes are not taking off from Hankou, but from somewhere northwest of Hankou. In the past, Japanese planes would quickly drop their bombs and immediately return to their base. However, in the past three weeks, Japanese planes have often been able to conduct fifteen to twenty minutes of reconnaissance before carrying out their bombings. It seems that they no longer need to worry about having enough gasoline. (Reuter, 5th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) On the night of the 4th, under a bright moon, Japanese planes attacked again in two batches. The Chinese Air Force and anti-aircraft units coordinated their fire and successfully repelled the attacking Japanese planes. Prior to the attack, the Air Defense Command received reports that approximately 18 Japanese planes, divided into two batches, were flying from western Hubei to attack Chongqing. The Chinese Air Force immediately took off to intercept them, and the anti-aircraft units and searchlights also coordinated their operations. Soon, the first batch of nine Japanese planes sneaked into the city's airspace from the southwest. The Chinese anti-aircraft units immediately launched a head-on attack. The Japanese planes hastily dropped their bombs and tried to escape to the northeast when they encountered the Chinese Air Force. A fierce battle broke out in the suburbs. The Chinese Air Force repeatedly attacked, and the Japanese planes, suffering damage, dared not linger and fled eastward. The second batch of ten Japanese planes flew to the eastern suburbs of Chongqing. After dropping bombs, they continued to fly into the city's airspace and circled several times. Because the Chinese air defense forces were closely monitoring them, the Japanese planes were unable to succeed and fled back to the eastern suburbs, where they dropped a few more bombs before escaping. According to a post-attack investigation, although the Japanese planes dropped many explosive bombs and incendiary bombs in the suburbs, most of them landed in the fields, so the Chinese side suffered only minor losses. Details are under investigation. (Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) This morning, before dawn, Japanese planes came to wreak havoc again. This is the fourth bombing that Chongqing has encountered this week. Chinese fighter planes took off upon hearing the alarm and initially intercepted them. However, several Japanese planes flew to the near suburbs of the city and the new commercial center, dropping bombs. Several heavy bombs fell near the Datong News Agency office. The front door, which had been locked, was blasted open, and the building also suffered slight damage. The extent of the damage throughout the city has not yet been fully reported. (Datong News Agency Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) On the morning of the 4th, during the Japanese attack on Chongqing, a heavy bomb fell in the consulate area. The British Consulate suffered slight damage, and the French Consulate building suffered more significant damage. Five people were killed nearby. Also, a bomb fell behind the German Consulate, destroying a portion of the consulate's building and causing significant material damage. Three neighboring houses were also affected and destroyed, killing three people and injuring two. The residence of Mr. Nord, an employee of the German Embassy, was also destroyed. In addition, the residence of Mr. Dou Dian'an, the special correspondent of the New York Times, was destroyed by a bomb that fell a few feet away. Mr. Dou's family and the famous writer, Mr. Xushi Te, who was visiting Dou's residence, took refuge in the air-raid shelter and were all unharmed. (Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) On the 4th, during the Japanese attack on Chongqing, the houses and property of the British, French, and German consulates were destroyed. On the 5th, during the air raid, Japanese planes dropped bombs near the Belgian Embassy, causing part of the embassy to be destroyed by shrapnel. The Chargé d'Affaires, Mr. Di Sang, guided reporters to inspect the bombed or damaged offices, dining rooms, reception rooms, and dormitories. Plaster had fallen from the walls, doors and windows were tilted, and rubble and broken glass were scattered everywhere. Embassy staff were spared because they had taken refuge in the air-raid shelter in advance. After the Japanese planes wreaked havoc nearby and before the all-clear signal was given, Chargé d'Affaires Di Sang and his friend, Mr. Cu Na, Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Belgian Bank, left the shelter to assist in rescue work. They often rescued three or four Chinese civilians and bandaged their wounds. Their spirit of chivalry is worthy of admiration. (Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chongqing was again subjected to an air raid this morning, which is the fourth time this week. The casualties are feared to be numerous. A total of eighteen Japanese planes, divided into two teams, concentrated their bombing on the northwestern suburbs, along the mountains facing the south bank of the Jialing River. All the houses were destroyed. The Belgian Embassy narrowly escaped being hit, with the bombs falling only a few inches away. The main gate of the embassy was shattered, all the glass windows were broken, and the plaster on the walls and ceilings fell in large quantities. The power poles leading to the embassy were bombed to the ground, making it very dangerous for pedestrians. Three cars outside the main gate were completely wrecked. Fortunately, no one was injured. At 1:30 AM, the first team of Japanese planes flew from the southeast, passed over Chongqing, and went to the northwest. Chinese anti-aircraft guns responded with heavy fire. The Japanese planes bombed in both the southeastern and northwestern suburbs, but more bombs were dropped in the northwestern suburbs. When the Japanese planes flew away, Chinese fighter planes took off from north of Chongqing and engaged the Japanese planes in a brief air battle. Over half an hour later, the second team of Japanese planes appeared and dropped bombs on the airport downstream of Chongqing before flying straight towards Chongqing. When they reached the western suburbs, they turned back to the east and bombed the airport for the second time as they flew downstream. It was initially reported that a third team of Japanese planes was flying towards Chongqing, but they did not appear. The all-clear signal was given at 3:00 AM. (Reuter, 5th)</p>

<h3>Negotiations for the Tripartite Pact Between Japan, Germany, and Italy Will Be Held in Germany, Rumored to Be Announced in September, Spain, Hungary, and Bulgaria Are Being Wooed, Japan's Intention Is to Boost Morale</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the rumor that Japan will join the alliance treaty of Germany and Italy, responsible parties here, upon hearing of it, refused to comment, only stating that negotiations on this matter are in progress and that revealing the results in advance would be contrary to German custom. The fact that these negotiations are not yet complete can be seen from this. Authoritative observers say that General Terauchi, the former Minister of the Army of Japan, and Admiral Osumi, the former Minister of the Navy, will lead a delegation to visit and are scheduled to arrive in Germany at the end of this month. The current negotiations should make substantial progress at that time so that the tripartite pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy can be announced in September, and solemnly announced at the National Socialist Party Congress. It is said that General Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, is the strongest advocate for changing the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance treaty. Mr. Shiratori Toshio, the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, has also expressed his support. It is rumored that when Ambassador Shiratori recently came to Berlin, Ambassador Oshima attempted to force Foreign Minister Arita to step down so that Shiratori could succeed him. Ambassador Oshima has recently met with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop many times to discuss the strengthening of the Anti-Comintern Pact. Some individuals in German political circles believe that Germany should strengthen its ties with Spain to counter any alliance that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union might form, but the government authorities are eager to establish an alliance treaty with Japan. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Diplomatic circles here learned today that preparations for Japan's entry into the Italian-German military alliance are in their final stages. Italy and Germany are also attempting to woo Spain, Hungary, and Bulgaria into the Italian-German military alliance structure. The totalitarian nations are apparently seeking to counteract the international impact caused by the termination of the Japanese-American trade treaty and the British-French-Soviet military talks. According to Japanese ambassadors to Germany and Italy, they have discussed Japan's entry into the Italian-German military alliance in Rome and Berlin and have chosen Cernobbio as the location for their final meeting, "because that is where German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano met before, and it is considered an auspicious place." Mr. Shiratori Toshio, the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, and General Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, stated that they would be staying in Cernobbio until Monday. (AP, 5th)</p>
<p>Talks Between Two Japanese Ambassadors Have Concluded</p>
<p>Milan - The talks between General Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, and Mr. Shiratori Toshio, the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, along with Japanese military attaches, held on the shores of Lake Como, have ended. Yesterday, the representatives had lengthy telephone calls with Tokyo and Berlin. The counselors of the German and Italian embassies traveled to Rome by plane, while the Japanese military attaches stationed in Italy went to northern Italy to observe Italian military exercises. (Datong Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers have not disclosed the contents of the Lake Como talks, only stating that the main purpose of the talks was for Japan to discuss policies for dealing with the European political situation. (Datong Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Milan - Mr. Shiratori Toshio, the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, General Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, and their entourage continued to meet at the Stresa village on the shores of Lake Como yesterday. The content of the discussions was kept strictly secret, but it is said that a detailed report has been sent to Tokyo. It is rumored that the two ambassadors plan to stay on the lake shore for a few more days or return to their posts on the 6th. (Datong Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Italian Newspapers Show No Enthusiastic Reaction</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the news that Mr. Shiratori Toshio, the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, and General Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, jointly telegraphed the Tokyo government to join the military alliance between Germany and Italy, The Times of London recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in Rome stating that Italian newspapers showed no enthusiastic reaction. This is most surprising. For all events that are truly welcomed by the Fascist government, Italian newspapers invariably exaggerate and embellish them. The fact that this matter is not mentioned at all is beyond the expectations of the general public. It should be noted that the proposal for Japan to join the military alliance between Germany and Italy was put forward by Germany and Italy several months ago. If Japan now requests to join, Germany and Italy would not be in a position to refuse. However, the situation has changed greatly since then. At the beginning of this year, Japan was not very involved in European disputes. Germany and Italy deeply hoped that Japan would have conflicts with Britain and France, so that a part of the navies of those countries would be restrained by the Far East situation. Today, even though Japan has not signed a military alliance treaty with the Berlin-Rome axis, it has already made enemies on its own. Germany and Italy have achieved their wish to restrain Britain and France in the Far East and can easily take advantage of it. If war breaks out between Britain and Japan, it will be easier for Germany and Italy to deal with the situation in Europe, and the diplomacy of those countries will be more powerful as a result. Why is it necessary to seek assistance from Japan? Conversely, if those countries become Japan's allies, they may have to fight Britain at an unfavorable time, which is not a wise plan. Based on this, even if the military alliance treaty between Germany, Italy, and Japan is realized, it will certainly have many loopholes, and it must provide considerable guarantees to Germany and Italy so that they are not bound by Far Eastern affairs. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(Rome) A semi-official communique was issued, the content of which differs somewhat from the statements made yesterday by Mr. Shiratori, the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, and General Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany. The communique stated that the ambassadors discussed the issue of "Japan joining the military alliance between Germany and Italy." However, when newspapers reprinted the above-mentioned statements, they used the phrase "Japan is strengthening cooperation with the Axis powers." This difference is noteworthy. Currently, the ambassadors are still residing on the shores of Lake Como awaiting instructions from the government. Military attaches from the Japanese embassies in Germany and Italy have gone to the Po River valley in northern Italy to observe army exercises. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Japan's Action Is Mostly Exploratory in Nature</p>
<p>(London) General Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, and Mr. Shiratori, the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, held a meeting in the town of Villa d'Este on the shores of Lake Como in Italy yesterday and issued statements. The implication is that Japan has a great possibility of joining the military alliance between Italy and Germany. Political figures here have commented on this matter, generally believing that the statements are exploratory in nature. Their intention is to demonstrate to democratic countries, due to the imminent conclusion of the talks in Moscow and the hardening of the United States' attitude towards Japan. The actions that Japan may take, Italy and Germany may not be willing to support in order to avoid being bound by constraints, and Japan may not be willing to establish overly rigid ties with those countries. From this perspective, it is difficult for Japan and the German-Italian axis to truly cooperate. The Times recently published an editorial commenting on the matter, also stating that the statements of the two ambassadors, Shiratori and Oshima, are exploratory in nature. It said, "The talks in Moscow have made progress, and the United States' attitude towards Japan is hardening. Japan is trying to put pressure on Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, issuing an indication that if the democratic countries do not maintain normal relations with Japan, the country may conclude an alliance treaty with Germany and Italy at any time. However, this kind of strategy may not achieve its purpose, and the Japanese government, apart from having diplomats and soldiers make statements, may not take further action to increase the obligations it bears." The "Strong News" reported, "The closer Japan cooperates with Germany and Italy, the more solid the relationship between the United States, the Soviet Union, and the democratic countries of Western Europe will become." In addition, other people from all walks of life have also discussed this, saying that if Japan joins the German-Italian alliance, its sound will only endanger itself. For example, Mr. Lei Wei, the Secretary-General of the Pacific Affairs Research Society, also believes that Japan may not take this action and said that the United States' announcement to terminate the U.S.-Japan trade treaty already contains a warning. If Japan joins the German-Italian alliance, the United States will definitely continue to take action. It is said that most of the petroleum needed by Japan comes from the United States, and if the United States stops supplying it, Japan's war against China cannot be sustained for more than six months. A representative of the European branch of the Chinese Nationalist Party stated that Japan joining the German-Italian alliance is a condition put forward by the German-Italian axis to aid Japan, so this matter is unavoidable. "However, what our Nationalist Party members can be encouraged by is that democratic countries will be able to cooperate more easily, and the United States will sooner or later join the peace front, which is what we welcome." General Malé, the former commander of the French troops in China, also expressed his opinion on the proposal for Japan to join the German-Italian alliance. He said that Japan may not be able to make a substantial threat to all the territories of the democratic countries in the Far East. There are four reasons for this: (1) Japan is already feeling difficulty in the war against China and cannot take care of other things; (2) If Japan attacks the territories of democratic countries, it is likely to have conflicts with the Soviet Union at any time; (3) Britain and France have cooperated in the Far East, and practical plans have been drawn up as a result of the Wellington Conference (representatives from the British and Australian Commonwealths and the New Zealand Dominion have met in Wellington to discuss Pacific defense) and the Singapore Conference; (4) If the situation in the Far East worsens, the United States' attitude will inevitably become more forceful, which is the biggest crisis for Japan. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>It Will Be Difficult for the United States to Sign a New Trade Treaty with Japan</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. government officials are very concerned about the statements made yesterday by the two Japanese ambassadors in Italy. The government authorities have not officially expressed their opinions, only stating that if Japan joins the German-Italian military alliance, it will treat third countries more like warring states. If so, it will be difficult for the U.S. government to conclude a new trade treaty, and U.S. public opinion will certainly support the government's ban on the export of military supplies to Japan. Senator Kim, a Democrat from Utah, said that Japan's move can indicate that it has previously flaunted with the German-Italian axis, and the gap between the U.S. and Japan will inevitably deepen. The United States will take more effective defense measures, and Congress may pass another 2,000,000,000 U.S. dollars in military spending. Kim also said that Japan's move will speed up the conclusion of a British-French-Soviet military alliance. Senior government officials indicated that the Japanese joining the German-Italian military alliance will raise several new issues: (1) The Soviet Union will be surrounded; (2) The strength of several British colonies will be weakened. However, the British-French-Soviet military talks to be held in Moscow in the middle of next week may take these points into consideration and take precautions. Most observers believe that this move by Japan will have the greatest impact on the psychology of the Japanese people and can resist the anti-aggression movement of the democratic bloc. American diplomatic circles believe that this move by Japan is not very important at the present time when the conflict in Europe is slightly calmer. They stated that if a European war breaks out, the United States may not be able to avoid participating, so the United States' foreign policy towards Japan should undoubtedly be paid attention to. People in the government all believe that this move by the Japanese will not have a great impact on American public opinion, because the American people have long recognized these totalitarian countries as a military unit, but public opinion will certainly support the ban on the export of military supplies to Japan. (AP, 5th)</p>
<p>Not Much Impact on the Sino-Japanese War</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The news from Rome that the Japanese ambassadors to Italy and Germany are discussing the conclusion of a military alliance treaty with Germany and Italy has not shocked officials here. Most officials today believe that the news was deliberately spread for the purpose of enhancing Japan's position in the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. Officials here have long anticipated that Japan is preparing to build on the foundation of a military alliance with Germany and Italy, the main purpose of which is for Japanese military figures to respond to the increasing conflicts between Tokyo, Washington, and London. Since Britain and Japan held talks in Tokyo, officials believe that Japan will strengthen its position in the negotiations by concluding a tripartite military alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy. The Japanese side will threaten Britain that unless Britain succumbs to Japan's conditions, Japan will sign a military alliance. Chinese officials claim that if Japan joins the German-Italian axis, it will provide the totalitarian countries with much-needed naval power. Chinese officials continued to say that they are unable to draw a fixed conclusion until Japan issues a statement about Japan joining the Rome-Berlin military alliance. They believe that Japan is spreading the news of its plan to sign a military alliance for the purpose of strengthening Japan's future position and engaging in immediate negotiations with Britain, while attempting to split the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union, because a British-Soviet military alliance would leave the Soviet Union with enemies on two borders. The Tokyo negotiations have not ended, and the Soviet-British military alliance has not yet been signed. Most Chinese believe that the news that the Japanese side has signed a military alliance is to test Britain's willingness to sign a peace agreement and reconcile with Japan. China is not worried about how the military alliance will affect the Sino-Japanese War. If a European war does not break out this year, then the military alliance can only help Japan with military supplies and other assistance. The Chinese believe that even if Japan does not sign an alliance, Japan will be able to obtain a steady stream of supplies from Germany and Italy. The recent U.S. termination of the U.S.-Japan trade treaty and the U.S. plan to implement a ban on the export of military supplies to Japan will weaken Japan's position more than the military alliance can offset. This is because both Germany and Italy feel a lack of oil, cotton, and other raw materials, and these military raw materials are necessary for Japan, and the totalitarian countries are short of capital and cannot provide loans to Japan. From the Chinese perspective, the military alliance will weaken Japan's position in the Far East, because a European war will deplete Japan's naval power and hinder the flow of large quantities of military supplies and other assistance into the Japanese-occupied areas of China to supply the Japanese army fighting in China. It is believed here that Japan is determined to expand its strength in the Far East and will not participate in Western wars. Although a military alliance can give the Japanese an excuse to take over Hong Kong and British concessions in China, the Chinese believe that even if there is no military alliance, Japan plans to occupy these areas when a European war breaks out, so a military alliance will not help Japan at all. As for Italy and Germany mediating the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese claim that such action is practically impossible because they do not believe that Japan will propose conditions that Chiang Kai-shek deems acceptable during negotiations. (AP, 5th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The news that Japan may join the Italian-German military alliance has once again sparked debate here as to whether this is beneficial or harmful to China's resistance against Japan. Most people believe that Japan's joining the alliance may be a disturbing factor in the initial stages, but it will ultimately be beneficial to China. This is because the move will effectively clarify the international situation and force Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries to abandon hopes of seeking a compromise with Japan. At the same time, for military reasons, the above-mentioned countries will necessarily assist China in its resistance against Japan. (Reuter, 5th)</p>
<h3>Japan Uncovers Assassination Plot; Pessimism Toward China War; People in Panic</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th - Associated Press correspondent Thompson reports that unease is gradually appearing among the Japanese public. On one hand, they are weary of the war, and on the other, they feel anxious about the future. Since the start of the war between China and Japan, it has been more than two years. Although the Japanese people have not diminished their patriotism during this war, they are already deeply dissatisfied with the lack of success in the fighting. This unease can be seen in the precautionary measures taken by the police authorities. Many men wearing white kimonos go to shrines in various places to pray every evening. Their actions are quite mysterious, so the police authorities have paid close attention to them. In addition, a major plot to assassinate important government figures has been uncovered due to a leak. In the past, various rebellions and riots have been preceded by religious fanaticism and mysterious rituals. Before Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated in 1932, members of the Blood Pledge Corps also acted in the same way. Furthermore, on July 15th of this year, the Tokyo police arrested three people who were plotting murder. According to their confessions, they confirmed a plot to assassinate former Minister Makino Nobuaki and the current Minister Yuasa Kurahira and Minister of the Imperial Household Matsudaira Tsuneo. Since then, unconfirmed news has spread in Japan that other murderers are plotting to assassinate Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa, Navy Vice Minister Yamamoto Isoroku, and former Minister (current Chairman of the Price Policy Committee) Ikeda Shigeaki. All of the above-mentioned figures are moderates whose abilities are top-notch. They oppose conflicts with other countries and use their influence to prevent the signing of a military alliance treaty between Germany, Italy, and Japan. As for Britain and the United States, they advocate a moderate attitude. It is said that Ikeda, Yuasa, and others are all figures disliked by ultra-nationalists. These ultra-nationalists are not familiar with the economic situation, and their knowledge of international affairs is very limited. They firmly believe that Japan can achieve a prominent position in the world through forceful methods. The anti-British movement in Tokyo this summer has already shown another phenomenon in the current situation.</p>

<h3>Details of Foreign Affairs Debate Before British Parliament Recesses; Members Urge Government to Take Strong Stance Against Japan; Chamberlain Still Advocates Maintaining Tolerance</h3>
<p>(London) - Labor MP Noel-Baker initiated a debate on foreign affairs in the House of Commons today, advocating that Britain abolish the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty. The Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, was also in the diplomatic gallery. Noel-Baker stated that since the drafting of the rules of war three hundred years ago, no war has been more barbaric and illegal than what Japan has done in China. History will not forget its shameless and cruel massacres. The U.S. State Department estimates that the Japanese have committed no fewer than six hundred acts of violence against American citizens, and the violence against British citizens must amount to thousands. The ultimate goal of the Japanese is to expel Westerners from Asia. The losses on the Chinese military side have decreased and are now equal to those of the Japanese. The only hope of the Japanese is to destroy guerrilla tactics, and the only effective way to achieve this is to undermine the trust of Chinese farmers in the Chinese legal tender. Chamberlain replied that the British government strongly opposes many unfortunate incidents involving the Japanese in recent months. I do not want to hide the fact that I want the House of Commons to be concerned about this situation because it presents special difficulties for Britain. There is a fundamental difference between Britain and the United States, which is separated from Europe. This hardly needs to be said. We must constantly remember that even as the Japanese inflict insults and injuries on British people in China, there is a limit to what we can do to help British people in China at this time. At this moment, we do not have a fleet in the Far East that is superior to Japan's. We have a superior navy in Europe, and in certain circumstances, it may be necessary to send this fleet. I hope that you will not always assume that such a situation is absolutely out of the question. I say this not as a threat, but as a warning. At the same time, we would rather resolve disputes with Japan through discussion and negotiation, without sacrificing what we consider to be fundamental concerns and principles, than to do so through threats of force. I often think of the isolated, helpless, and undefended British people scattered throughout China. Even if we clearly decide to take the ultimate and extreme action, we cannot protect many British expatriates. We have a responsibility to them and should not put them in greater danger than they are currently in if we can avoid it. The Prime Minister, in his speech, praised the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, for handling extremely difficult negotiations with great ability, composure, and courage. The Prime Minister continued to discuss the proposed solutions, saying that it does not matter how the words of the solutions are interpreted, but how their meaning is interpreted in practice. If the British government declares that this solution does not contain any change in policy, and in fact British policy has not changed, then this declaration is more important than anything else. In any case, this solution has allowed us to discuss the very sensitive situation in Tianjin. Speaking of some of the difficulties, it seems that we should not have great difficulty in reaching an agreement with the Japanese. I can say that because the agreement must be viewed as a whole, it is useless to agree on one point if agreement cannot be reached on other points. Those currently handling the negotiations are not as inclined to extremes or unreasonable as many of the Japanese we see in China. As for the current Japanese request for joint policing in Tianjin, I do not know what this so-called "Japanese" refers to, because opinions in Tianjin and Japan often differ. But in cases of doubt, I believe we should accept the opinions of Tokyo. The basis for discussion in Tokyo is not for Anglo-Japanese joint policing, but for the police power to remain in the hands of the Municipal Council or its officials. Regarding the four suspects in the assassination of Cheng, I do not consider Noel-Baker's demand that the government guarantee that they will not be extradited under any circumstances to be different, but I cannot call Noel-Baker a person with a judicial sense. Noel-Baker interjected upon hearing this, saying that this is not a matter of judicial sense, but a matter of national honor. Chamberlain replied that he absolutely did not think so. This is a matter of evidence. If there is evidence to prove that these four people are indeed related to the assassination of Cheng, would Noel-Baker say that not extraditing them is a matter of honor? Our position has always been that we cannot extradite them without evidence. Today, Japan has presented evidence, and we are currently studying it. I do not intend to announce what the verdict will be after legal authorities have studied it. If the result of the study is that there is clear evidence of criminal activity, then we have no right to take any action other than extradition. Chamberlain continued to respond to Noel-Baker's remarks, saying that the court is a Chinese court that has existed for a long time, and it is the court to which criminals have been handed over in the past twenty months. Chamberlain continued to mention the silver deposit issue, saying that this discussion must be a local issue. This has been agreed upon. The difficulty now lies in the fact that this silver is in Tianjin, and the problems arising from the currency system involve the circulation of Tianjin legal tender. In the opinion of the British government, we cannot handle the Tianjin problem without truly involving problems elsewhere. Whatever measures we take regarding silver deposits or currency will inevitably affect a much wider area than Tianjin. Not only the British government is related to these two points. We have explained to the Japanese government that we are not prepared to solve the two problems of silver deposits and currency with Japan alone. These two problems can only be solved after consultation with other governments that have the same relationship. I do not intend to specify whether to consult or not. Which will be our attitude? I want to say that I do not object to Noel-Baker's remarks regarding the relationship between maintaining Chinese currency and China's ability to continue guerrilla warfare. As for the suggestion to abolish the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty, we have never gone back on anything. There is nothing in our obligations in Geneva and Beijing that would cause us to abolish the commercial treaty with Japan. If I do not give Noel-Baker the assurance that we will abolish this treaty, it seems that I have decided not to abandon this treaty, but I will not allow anyone to interpret my words. Chamberlain continued, saying that the abolition of the treaty will only take effect after twelve months, and the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty is attached to the commercial treaties of several autonomous territories. Therefore, the British abolition of the commercial treaty with Japan will have a significant impact on the autonomous territories. It would be autocratic if the British government did not take these facts into account. We are forced to bear some very significant responsibilities and constraints in Europe, the effect of which is that if some event occurs in Europe, Britain must go to war. Therefore, Britain cannot make the same constraints in the Far East. Britain is a country with immeasurable financial resources, and its people have a resolute spirit. However, there is a limit to what we should take on. All events in the Far East are truly inspiring. I sympathize with them. I am also moved by events in the Far East. But no matter how we feel, let us not forget the responsibilities we have already shouldered, or the situation of our men and women in that area. Chamberlain concluded by saying that we will strive to continue negotiations, maintain the principles on which our actions are based, and the welfare of the British in that area. We will strive to show patience and reasonable moderation, acknowledging that behind this violence there may be genuine concerns among the Japanese in China about how we treat them. However, we must not forget that in the coming months, there may be even more serious and pressing issues to consider. We must maintain our strength to cope with any event that may occur.

<p>(London) - During the discussion of the Far East situation in the House of Commons last night before the summer recess, Labor MP Noel-Baker said that on the one hand, we are spending millions of pounds to resist aggression in Europe, and on the other hand, we are buying goods exported from Japan to finance its aggression in the Far East. This situation is quite amazing. Japan is now using all its force to try to force Britain to be its true accomplice in its aggression in China. Labor members have expressed concern about the Tokyo negotiations from the beginning. The Japanese are actually trying to extort and use the Tokyo solutions as a starting point for making greater and unacceptable demands. Noel-Baker also expressed serious concern about the joint policing control in Tianjin, saying that Japan has used this point elsewhere to arrest Chinese who harm and are loyal to the Chinese government. Japan's actions are damaging our prestige, which is very important in the East. If this continues for a long time, it will damage the entire policy of the British government to avoid war. We should declare China as part of the peace front. Conservative MP Admiral Sir Roger Keyes then declared that he had spent a long time with the Japanese and knew that if we were hesitant and self-deprecating, it would only lead them to further aggression. If strong action had been taken in the past, it would never have led to today's danger. British naval personnel all know that the government's desire to avoid accidents in the Far East has placed its naval and army commanders in a position of humiliation, and has made it extremely difficult for them to deal with arrogant and ambitious Japanese military leaders. Losing face in the East is an extremely serious matter, but if we take the right path now, our prestige can be quickly restored. We need great action in the East to show the Japanese that we Europeans will not tolerate such behavior. Conservative MP Mr. McNamara finally spoke, hoping that the government would review the issue of foreign concessions in China after the situation stabilizes. From a military point of view, these concessions are equivalent to isolated sentry posts, which are tiresome. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) - At a meeting of the House of Commons this morning to discuss the Far East issue, several important members, such as Liberal MP Mendell and Conservative MP Colonel McNamara, all advocated that all countries with relations in the Far East, such as the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, the Dutch East Indies, French Vietnam, Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union, should form a united front to confront Japan. Colonel McNamara also said, "Only one of the English-language newspapers in Japan belongs to British merchants, and the rest are run by Americans or Japanese. Therefore, the Japanese cannot understand British views. This layer must be remedied." (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>British and French Newspapers Comment on the Far East Situation; British Prime Minister Warns Japan; Patience Has Limits</h3>
<p>(London) - The Daily Mail published an editorial today, mentioning Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons yesterday regarding the dispatch of the British fleet to the Far East, saying that this was indeed serious language, but it was very much in line with the spirit of our country. Every British citizen shares the emotions expressed by the Prime Minister when he announced that several recent events in China had caused his blood to boil. Our patience has limits, and this warning to the Japanese has not crossed that limit. We are now too busy with many things in Europe. In the current situation, it is better for us to maintain peace in the West than to provoke war in the East. The Daily Telegraph said that the Prime Minister has issued a serious warning to Japan, which should make the East understand that our patience is not endless. Our major responsibilities elsewhere force us to be cautious in dealing with the overall situation in the Far East, but it would be a great mistake to think that the people of Britain will not be filled with anger at everything that is happening in the Far East. The Times said that there is no doubt that Japanese diplomacy has been under great pressure from the Japanese army on the Asian continent in the past two months. However, it is unlikely that Japanese military leaders will be unmoved by Chamberlain's statement that Britain may be forced to take various measures. The current situation is not one that makes the British government willing to disperse its naval strength. However, the more rational among those negotiating with Japan in the East, if they know that such moves are being prepared, may also oppose any expansion of the scope of the Tianjin dispute. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) - This morning, Parisian newspapers discussed British Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks and Japan's position on the Axis powers, and the Japanese demands were noted by public opinion. The newspaper L'Ordre published an article by the famous journalist Bertin, saying that if Japanese aggression increases and the Tokyo negotiations do not progress, then the only thing the British Prime Minister can do is to withdraw the small number of British troops stationed in Tianjin and Shanghai who cannot perform anything, and to notify Japan that if there are any more acts that harm British interests, then Britain will immediately provide large-scale assistance to General Chiang Kai-shek and implement economic sanctions. But is Chamberlain prepared to take this courageous step? His remarks are not without contradictions. Le Temps stated that the Japanese proposal to form an alliance with the Axis powers is the result of Britain's moderate posture. At present, we cannot take any action to separate Germany, Italy, and Japan. Because of the agreement with Craigie, Britain is in fact willing to let Japan seize China at will. However, Japan is not satisfied with this and is coveting Hong Kong, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaya, and Singapore. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) - The Daily Telegraph's naval correspondent, Seward, commented on the potential of the Far East's national navy today after Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that Britain might send a fleet to the Far East, saying that even today, Britain could send a fleet of warships with sufficient strength to form a navy to the Pacific Ocean, without greatly reducing Britain's naval strength in Europe and could prevent large-scale speculative actions by Japan at sea. The British government has made a firm promise to Australia to send such a fleet to Singapore if necessary. If this is implemented, then this fleet will combine with at least ten cruisers and destroyer fleets from China, Australia, and New Zealand, and fifteen of Britain's best submarines, to form an elite navy. As for the many warships that will be transferred from home and abroad to dangerous areas in the future, they have not yet been calculated. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) - The Manchester Guardian's editorial today said that Chamberlain's warning in the House of Lords was the most honest analysis of British policy in China. From his own limited perspective of viewing China as a battlefield for British and Japanese interests, Chamberlain's explanation of what the British government hopes for and fears is more accurate than usual, and Chamberlain also carefully and frankly stated that Britain will take more stringent action when Japanese threats are more intolerable than they are now. On the whole, Chamberlain's remarks are more resolute than before. In summary, no matter how strong or weak the policy is, we will suffer great losses in the Far East, but a weak policy will result in even greater losses. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Newspaper Observes British Policy</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) - The misunderstandings of the Chinese towards British policy in China after the announcement of the Anglo-Japanese agreement are now gradually being replaced by satisfaction, and the Japanese believe that Britain does not want to let China fall. Today's Chongqing United Daily News carried an article entitled "The Trend Towards International Peace and Justice," which stated that the United States' abolition of the U.S.-Japanese commercial treaty, Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons reaffirming the invariance of U.S. policy in China, Sir Simon's appropriate remarks on Chinese currency, and Sir Robert Craigie's refusal in Tokyo to hand over the silver deposits in the British Concession in Tianjin or to prohibit the circulation of Chinese legal tender in Tianjin, and the satisfactory progress of the Moscow negotiations, all prove that the joint efforts of countries around the world in managing international peace and justice are becoming stronger and forming closer cooperation. If Japan does not realize its own mistakes, overthrow the military's hegemony, and withdraw its troops in China, then not only will China continue to resist, but also the day when the strength of peace and justice effectively contain its aggression will soon come. The article concluded, "Our final victory is beyond doubt. If we continue to resist resolutely, then international peace and justice will eventually prevail." (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) - British Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons yesterday have aroused two different feelings among the people here. Some people believe that the Prime Minister's candid discussion of the situation in the Far East is far more satisfactory than ambiguous declarations. Others believe that the Prime Minister's remarks may not be beneficial and may only expose Britain's inability to act in the Far East, or may encourage Japanese aggression even more. At the same time, they expressed skepticism about the British Prime Minister's statement of British impotence, believing that Britain has other ways to stop Japan besides a powerful fleet. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Undersecretary of State Explains Far East Foreign Policy; The Path to Be Taken Should Still Be Decided Independently; Cooperation with Britain and the Establishment of Understanding</h3>
<p>(Washington) - According to Undersecretary of State Welles's reply today to a question about British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech on the situation in China, the United States will determine its own path in the Far East. The United States and Britain have no understanding of taking joint action in the East. Welles also declined to comment on Chamberlain's speech. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Washington) - British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons today was interpreted by political figures here as an appeal to the United States to cooperate with Britain in the Far East, but it was not explicitly stated. Although the spokespersons of the U.S. government have repeatedly stated that U.S. actions maintain an independent nature and have no understanding with Britain, if the United States takes any action to inform Japan that the United States and Britain have the same views and interests in the Far East, then there would be no dissent in principle in either Congress or public opinion. Public opinion even believes that punitive measures against Japan should be implemented sooner rather than later. However, officials in the State Department believe that there is no need to take new action at present, because if Japan strikes at the interests of Western countries in the Far East again, the United States will often react. This determination can be fully demonstrated by the United States' prohibition of the transportation of arms and raw materials to Japan in six months' time, which Japan also understands. At this moment, certain U.S. newspapers and political figures are advocating sending a naval fleet to the Far East to demonstrate. In general, if the President makes this decision, public opinion will certainly support it. It is also rumored in the Congressional cloakroom that the naval fleet is about to sail to the Hawaiian Islands, but the State Department and the Navy Department say that no such decision has been made. In addition, Japan may join the military alliance treaty between Germany and Italy. After hearing this, the United States was deeply impressed. If this comes true, then President Roosevelt's view that the United States will be threatened by the joint actions of Japan, Germany, and Italy will be confirmed, and the President's position will inevitably be strengthened, it can be asserted.

<h3>Danzig Crisis Enters Critical Stage: 150,000 German Troops Concentrated on Polish Border; Germany Seeks Italy's Attitude on Alliance Treaty; Poland Argues for Tariff Rights</h3>
<p>(London) This morning, alarming news spread again that a large number of German troops have been concentrated on the Polish border. According to reliable sources in London, 150,000 German troops, mostly fully mechanized units, are now concentrated near Marienwerder, a location near the Polish border. Meanwhile, the "Daily Telegraph" correspondent in Prague also reported that orders had been received there that all roads under construction or repair leading to the Polish border must be completed and ready for use by August 24. Furthermore, yesterday's "News Chronicle" correspondent in Warsaw reported that, according to reliable sources, 150,000 to 160,000 German troops have been concentrated on the western border of Poland. At the same time, a large number of German troops, carrying long-range artillery, are currently stationed in Stoppen, opposite the territory of Danzig. (Reuter, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to well-informed sources here, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will soon meet at a selected location. This decision is being carried out by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and the Italian Ambassador to Germany, Attolico, in accordance with the provisions of the German-Italian alliance treaty. Its nature is a step beyond ordinary diplomatic contact. It is said to have originated from Germany and is an "exchange of views" before the practical implementation of the military alliance between the two countries. From Italy's perspective, the German authorities, perhaps because the Danzig issue is entering a critical stage and could lead to war, want to know exactly what Italy's attitude is. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) According to消息 received here, the Polish government has presented a note to the Danzig Senate, stating that Polish customs officials stationed at the border between the city and the province of East Prussia in Germany, who have been transferred elsewhere by the City Senate, should be immediately returned to their original posts. If this is not done, the customs surveillance line between Danzig and Germany will be abolished, which will inevitably lead to a serious situation. In addition, it is also heard that Poland has given the City Senate a deadline to submit a reply within today. Upon hearing this news, British political circles are deeply concerned about the increasingly serious situation in Danzig. As for why the Polish government has given the Danzig Senate such a short deadline, it is because Polish Commander-in-Chief General Smigly-Rydz is scheduled to deliver a speech tomorrow in Krakow to commemorate the founding of the Polish volunteer army in the early stages of the European War and is eager to know the Danzig Senate's attitude towards the customs issue. However, the draft of the speech has been finalized. General Smigly-Rydz yesterday afternoon held a long discussion with Foreign Minister Beck and the Polish Ambassador to England, Raczyński, during which the Danzig issue was discussed. Furthermore, according to news from Berlin, German military preparations are being intensified, which is another reason for the unease felt by British political circles. Considering that senior officials of the Foreign Office continue to work as usual during weekend holidays and bank holidays, and maintain contact with the capitals of relevant countries, and that Foreign Secretary Halifax will listen to reports from his subordinates by direct telephone every day, one can see how seriously the British authorities regard the situation in the Free City of Danzig.

<h3>Hitler: The End is Nigh – Prophecy of a Parisian Astrologer</h3>
<p>(Paris) Parisian astrological newspapers and magazines have published articles discussing the fate of German leader Hitler, saying, "If Hitler is not overthrown by a revolution on Earth, he will surely be destroyed by a revolution in the heavens." "The World of Tomorrow" newspaper said that all astrologers agree that "Hitler's star is already falling." Another magazine said, "A revolution will occur in the sky, the result of which will be to move Hitler's star from a 'circle of light' into a 'circle of darkness.'" Hitler himself is said to have told the French Ambassador to Germany, "The end of my fate is near." Among Jewish refugees in Paris, a numerical story is also circulating, saying that Hitler's end will come in 1939. This mathematical game involves adding together his year of birth, the date and time he came to power, and the year of his downfall. Half of the sum of these four numbers will be the day of his downfall. This formula has been applied to other historical figures and has always been accurate. Hitler was born in 1889, came to power in 1933, has been in power for six years, and will be 50 years old when he falls. The sum of these four numbers is 3878, and half of that is exactly 1939.

<h3>Political Kidnappings at Peiping Catholic University; Wealthy Father and Crouse Kidnapped; Motive to Force Handover of List of Students Going South</h3>
<p>(Peiping) According to news from here today, two kidnapping cases have occurred this week at Fu Jen Catholic University (now owned by Americans). One is the school's Dean of Students, the Chinese Father Fu, and the other is the school's Academic Dean, the Dutchman Crouse. The reason for this is to threaten the school to hand over the list of students who are about to go south. The instigator is believed to be the Japanese, and the perpetrators are personnel from the "Provisional Government." Father Fu was kidnapped on Wednesday morning. At that time, Father Fu was trying to go to the main building to lead Mass when two plainclothes Chinese men appeared, kidnapped him into a car, and sped away. The university guards were panicked at the time and allowed him to be kidnapped without interference. On Thursday, two more Chinese men came to Fu Jen University and asked to see Father Crouse. When Father Crouse came out to meet them, the two Chinese men claimed that they were there to discuss the disappearance of Father Fu and asked Father Crouse to go to the police station to sign documents. Therefore, Father Crouse went with them, but when they reached a car, the two men tried to kidnap Father Crouse into the car. However, Father Crouse was six feet tall and had strength, and he knocked the two men down. At the same time, he ran back to the university, but unfortunately, his foot was tripped by his long gown, and he fell to the ground, allowing the two Chinese men to catch up and threaten him with a pistol. Therefore, he was kidnapped. Only yesterday did Father Crouse manage to notify the school authorities by telephone, saying that he was now in a Chinese prison, dirty and hot, and asked the school authorities to send clean clothes. However, he believed that he would be released soon, so he asked the school authorities not to worry. Fu Jen University has now informed the Japanese Embassy that if the two kidnapped Fathers can be released, the matter will not be made public. The Dutch chargé d'affaires has also informed the Japanese side that if the Japanese can release Father Crouse, he does not intend to ask his government to lodge a serious protest.

<h3>General Situation of the National University Joint Enrollment in the 27th Year (Part 1) – Over 10,000 Applicants, Approximately 5,000 Admitted</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The unified enrollment method for national universities during this summer vacation has been repeatedly reported in previous newspapers. The Ministry of Education has now compiled and investigated the applicants, admitted students, their aspirations, selected subjects, students admitted without examination, and how the Ministry of Education allocated students for the unified enrollment of national universities in the 27th year. The report statistics are very detailed. Here, we selectively record the main points.</p>
<p>In the past, the enrollment of new students in colleges and universities was handled separately by each school. Each school held at least one enrollment each year. Each student had to take the exams of several schools in succession when applying to universities, which was uneconomical for both school administration and individuals. In order to avoid this unreasonable phenomenon, the Ministry of Education ordered the National Central University, Wuhan University, Zhejiang University, Peking University, Tsinghua University, and other schools to jointly enroll students in the 26th year. Later, due to the special circumstances of the schools in Beiping, the joint enrollment was organized by the Central, Wuhan, and Zhejiang Universities. In the 27th year, due to the war of resistance, the Ministry of Education, in order to adapt to the special environment and needs, formulated the general outline of the unified enrollment method for national universities in the 27th year in June and issued it to national universities for compliance. National vocational schools and provincial private vocational schools above the college level, after being approved by the Ministry of Education, still enrolled students on their own as in the past. There are nine regulations ((8) Graduates of this year's joint graduation examination may be recommended, and the top 15% of excellent students may be distributed to various colleges and universities without examination. (9) Students with equivalent qualifications are allowed to register for the examination for new students this year, but the number of admitted students shall not exceed 10% of the total number of admitted students). "The remaining items 1 to 7 are omitted." All colleges and universities enroll students in accordance with the regulations. The following is a separate description of the students who were admitted without examination and the students of national universities in the rear who were enrolled in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The examination subjects are divided into written and oral examinations. The written examination subjects are divided into three groups: "Group 1" (1) Civics, (2) Chinese, (3) English, (4) Chinese History and Geography, (5) Foreign History and Geography, (6) Mathematics (Algebra, Plane Geometry, Trigonometry), (7) Select one subject from Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. Candidates for the faculties of arts, law, business, and teacher training colleges, departments of education, civics education, physical education, Chinese, English, history and geography, home economics, and art and labor vocational schools will be tested on this. "Group 2" (1) Civics, (2) Chinese, (3) English, (4) Chinese History and Geography, (5) Mathematics (Advanced Algebra, Plane Geometry, Analytic Geometry, Trigonometry), (6) Physics, (7) Chemistry. Candidates for the faculties of engineering, departments of mathematics, physics, chemistry, astronomy, meteorology, and civil engineering of the Faculty of Science, and departments of mathematics, physics, and chemistry of teacher training colleges will be tested on this. "Group 3" (1) Civics, (2) Chinese, (3) English, (4) Chinese History and Geography, (5) Mathematics (Advanced Algebra, Plane Geometry, Trigonometry), (6) Biology (Foreign History and Geography instead of Biology for candidates for the Geography Department), (7) Select one subject from Physics and Chemistry. Candidates for the faculties of medicine and agriculture, departments of biology, geography, and geology of the Faculty of Science, the Department of Natural History of teacher training colleges, and dental schools will be tested on this.

<p>Yesterday was the fourth day of the Exhibition of Fine Prints of Western Paintings. Chinese and foreign visitors were even more enthusiastic, with the number of people almost doubling compared to the previous day. The viewers lingered in the exhibition hall, reluctant to leave. Painter Zhang Chongren lectured his students on the advantages of various schools of works at the exhibition. Several famous Shanghai painters also held a forum at the exhibition.

A thick catalog is also given away with the tickets. The catalog classifies the famous works displayed in this exhibition in detail and records them in great detail.

<h3>The Panic Over New Banknotes Has Not Dissipated; Funds are Again Seeking Ways to Escape; US Dollar Approaches the 8 Yuan Mark; Pound Sterling Nears Four "辦士"</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in HSBC's listed rates. In the unofficial markets, following news from foreign telegrams that the Ministry of Finance had instructed the Bank of England to print 100 million new banknotes, public anxiety remained high. Moreover, aggressive absorption by Yokohama Specie Bank, the Chinese Merchants' Cotton Mill Association, and others, coupled with requests from Hong Kong, and HSBC's reluctance to sell except at premium prices, led to a tightening of the market. The pound sterling once tightened to Four "辦士" and .0625, while the US dollar broke through the 8 yuan barrier, retreating to 7.875. The buying spree subsided slightly at noon, and the market stabilized somewhat, closing with the pound sterling at Four "辦士" and .09375, and the US dollar at 7.9375. The forward market for the current month saw strong buying interest from Chinese merchants and speculators, as well as Japanese banks, driving the pound sterling through the Four "辦士" mark. In the end, the pound sterling tightened by .21875, and the US dollar softened by .4375, with some fluctuations in between, but no major waves. Trading was quite active during the morning. Hong Kong dollar conditions were also somewhat chaotic, with the final bank selling price contracting to 28.25 yuan.</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Merchants Compete to Purchase</p>
<p>Early in the morning, London spot and forward rates were both .0625 higher. New York silver prices were stagnant. London gold prices remained flat. Exchange rates between the pound and the dollar were unchanged, and down slightly, about .00125, against Shanghai and unchanged against the French franc. The US dollar was flat against both the British pound and the French franc, and down by .02 against Shanghai. The central government's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price for the pound sterling at Four "辦士" and .25, and for the US dollar at 8.25 yuan, the pound sterling tightened by .046875 compared to the previous day, and the US dollar softened by .0625. After opening, the market tightened slightly as foreign firms settled accounts. Foreign firms settled spot pound sterling at Four "辦士" .25 and .12875, and spot US dollars at 8.21875. Although the Chinese Merchants' Cotton Mill Association also came to settle accounts, the market temporarily hardened because foreign firms were still willing to sell. Jardine Matheson, Banque Belge pour l'Étranger, and Banque Franco-Chinoise sold spot US dollars at 8.25 to the Chinese Merchants' Cotton Mill Association. Simultaneously, an American bank sold spot US dollars to another bank at 8.28125, along with pound sterling for the current month at Four "辦士" and .0625. When HSBC's listed rates were revealed late in the day, there were no fluctuations. It was announced that the silver equalization tax would continue to be waived. Subsequently, the market tightened again as Japanese banks suddenly began absorbing currencies, and foreign firms' willingness to sell waned. The Yokohama Specie Bank settled spot pound sterling at Four "辦士" and .1875 from foreign firms. Telegrams from Hong Kong also began to arrive, adding to the aggressive buying. As Chinese merchants and Japanese banks continued their activities, the situation tightened further. Japanese banks and telegrams from Hong Kong bought spot pound sterling from foreign firms like HSBC, with prices tightening from Four "辦士" and .125 to .0625. They also purchased spot US dollars from a certain bank, with prices shrinking from 8 yuan to 7.875. Later, the Yokohama Specie Bank bought pound sterling for the current month at Three "辦士" and .96875 from foreign firms like Banque Belge pour l'Étranger. Soon after, it settled US dollars for the current month at 7.6875 and .625 from a certain bank with Chinese merchants. By then, it was noon. Reports indicated that the selling price of spot Hong Kong dollars had contracted to 28.25 yuan. At the noon close, the selling price of spot pound sterling was Four "辦士" and .09375, and for US dollars, 7.9375 yuan. Pound sterling for the current month was at Three "辦士" .0625, and US dollars at 7.5625 yuan. As a result, spot pound sterling tightened by .103125 compared to the previous day, while US dollars softened by .375. Pound sterling for the current month softened by .21875, and US dollars strengthened by .4375. There was no market in the afternoon due to it being Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Dollar Exchange Rate Rises Sharply</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 5th – The exchange market opened steadily today. Rates for the British pound and Japanese yen were unchanged. The US dollar forward rate contracted by .0625, to 28.5 yuan. The Shanghai dollar exchange rate rose by 6 yuan, to 342 yuan. At 11:30, the market shifted from stable to soft. The spot rate for the British pound tightened by .03125, to 1 shilling, 2 "辦士" and .65625. The forward rate was unchanged. The US dollar contracted by .0625, with the spot rate at 28.5625 yuan and the forward rate at 28.4375 yuan. The Shanghai dollar exchange rate continued to rise by 6 yuan, to 348 yuan. The Japanese yen contracted by .125, to 104.5 yuan. At the noon close, the spot rate for the British pound was unchanged, while the forward rate followed, tightening by .03125, to 1 shilling, 2 "辦士" and .625. The Shanghai dollar exchange rate rose another 2 yuan, to 350 yuan, a total increase of 14 yuan for the half-day. There will be no market this afternoon due to Saturday and next Monday.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Market Also Contracts</p>
<p>Tianjin, 5th – The exchange market opened weakly today, contracting by .025 against the British pound, to 3 "辦士" and .375, and tightening by .5 yuan against the US dollar, to 6.5625 yuan. The Shanghai dollar exchange rate rose by 5 yuan, to 127 yuan. The unofficial rate for "Joint Banknotes" rose by 1.5 yuan, to 101 yuan.</p>
<h3>One Hundred Million New Banknotes—A Mystery</h3>
<p>The Reuters report of 100 million new banknotes caused a dramatic shift in Shanghai's financial circles. Gold prices have risen by 255 yuan in two days, the US dollar exchange rate has contracted by .46875 in two days, and the British pound exchange rate has contracted by .234375. Yarn prices have soared, government bonds have plummeted, and foreign currencies have risen rapidly, with the pound sterling reaching 93 yuan and the US dollar reaching 97 yuan. While the market shares a common sense of panic regarding these 100 million new banknotes, there is also a sense of mystery. Some speculate that it will further inflate the currency, while others believe that a portion of it is treasury bonds intended specifically for purchasing foreign exchange. Some also speculate that it is for preparing for currency consolidation after the war, while others say that it is to replenish the market after the gradual contraction of mixed currency. There are also those who say that since the centralization of banknote issuance, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications still issue banknotes. In the future, all banknotes should be issued by the Central Bank alone, so the Central Bank is printing such a large amount of banknotes. Given the current volatile state of public sentiment, any news can fuel speculation. It is thought that this matter will be clarified soon, and that the majority of the banknotes are still being printed in London.</p>
<h3>One US Dollar Valued at 97 Legal Tender Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the shortage and high prices of foreign exchange caused British and American gold pounds to rise sharply. The pound sterling stood at 93.5 yuan, and the US dollar at 97 yuan. The demand for British and American gold notes was even stronger, and the market was firm, with British gold notes at 58 yuan and US gold notes at 13.06 yuan. The demand for Hong Kong notes and French franc notes was also strong, and they also rose. Singapore notes, Dutch notes, and others followed suit. Japanese gold notes also trended firmer, reaching 1.09 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes also rose, reaching 0.89 yuan in the evening market. In exchange transactions, only Qin Tai sold 500 yuan of US gold notes to Xiang Feng. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold pounds and British gold notes each rise by 2.5 yuan, US gold pounds rise by 4 yuan, US gold notes rise by 0.41 yuan, Hong Kong notes rise by 0.13 yuan, French franc notes rise by 0.0031 yuan, Singapore notes and Dutch notes each rise by 0.3 yuan, Annam notes, Rupi notes, and German gold notes each rise by 0.1 yuan, Canadian notes rise by 0.8 yuan, Philippine notes rise by 0.2 yuan, Italian notes rise by 0.02 yuan, and Australian gold notes rise by 2 yuan. Only Siamese notes remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Tightens to Maintained Price; Gold Soars to the Skies</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the unofficial cash gold market saw an intensification of rising prices, nearly breaking through the 3,900 yuan barrier. However, fluctuations were quite rapid, rising and falling intermittently, generally shifting with the tightening and loosening of foreign exchange. Initially, the market opened with a continued softening of foreign exchange, coupled with persistent rumors about the Ministry of Finance's additional printing of new banknotes in England. Moreover, some outside the industry, seeing the upward trend, also came to purchase, resulting in an overwhelming buying atmosphere that caused a sudden jump of 105 yuan, opening at the 3,800 yuan barrier. Subsequently, foreign exchange suddenly rebounded slightly, triggering a selling wave. A certain gold firm (acting for speculators) and other gold firms rushed to sell, causing the market to weaken and plummet to a low of 3,730 yuan. Around 9:45 AM, news broke that foreign exchange was tightening sharply, approaching the HSBC maintained supply price for the Exchange Equalization Fund. Buying surged again, and money exchange firms and wealthy merchants aggressively absorbed gold. Securities firms also bought more than they sold, and sellers raised prices significantly, causing a dramatic surge to a high of 3,895 yuan. At noon, foreign exchange flattened, and a certain money exchange firm aggressively sold dozens of taels, pulling back to 3,855 yuan at the noon close. As a result, cash gold soared by another 160 yuan compared to the previous day. There was no formal market in the afternoon. It was reported that transactions outside the market were being made at 3,867 yuan. There were about 600 taels of light volume and wholesale transactions. Jewelry gold was ultimately listed 15 yuan higher. Customs gold and Sino-British fine gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Rises by 160 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (10 taels) opened with a jump of 105 yuan due to reports that foreign exchange continued to tighten, strengthening investor confidence. Securities firms were very willing to buy, and sellers were optimistic about the future. A securities firm bought 10 taels from a gold firm at a price of 3,800 yuan. Subsequently, news that foreign exchange had rebounded slightly caused buyers to become scarce, and a gold firm acting on behalf of speculators took profits, and other gold firms were also willing to sell. Consequently, prices fell sharply, soon plummeting 70 yuan. A gold firm sold 20 taels to jewelry firms at a price of 3,730 yuan, which was the low of the day. Around 9:40 AM, news broke that foreign exchange was trending tighter, reigniting buying interest. A certain gold firm also stopped selling and adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Prices rose 70 yuan. A securities firm sold 20 taels to a money exchange firm at a price of 3,800 yuan. At that time, a certain jewelry store sold on behalf of a customer, causing prices to slump slightly. A gold firm sold 20 taels to a money exchange firm at a price of 3,792 yuan, then sold 10 taels to a securities firm at a price of 3,790 yuan. Thereafter, news spread that the tightening of foreign exchange was intensifying, and sellers raised prices even more, causing prices to rise again, soaring another 105 yuan. A securities firm bought 20 taels from a money exchange firm at a price of 3,895 yuan, which was the high of the day. Near noon, news broke that the tightening of foreign exchange had stopped and rebounded slightly. A certain money exchange firm sold dozens of taels aggressively, causing prices to fall slightly by 40 yuan. A money exchange firm sold 20 taels to a certain gold firm at a price of 3,855 yuan, which was the noon closing price. As a result, cash gold soared by 160 yuan compared to the previous day. There were fluctuations of 165 yuan in the morning. The cash gold price of cash gold firms was about 10 yuan higher, while the spot gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. It was reported that there were few deals being made.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Listed 15 Yuan Higher</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold was initially 375 yuan at Da Tong Heng and others. At 9:37, it suddenly increased by 10 yuan, fell back by 5.5 yuan and fifty cents, and then increased by another 5 yuan at 11:00. At 11:40, it increased by another 5 yuan, and at 11:57, it increased by another 5 yuan, before falling back by 5 yuan at 12:10. After that, there were no further changes. In total, it increased by 15 yuan. Da Si Heng and others listed it at 390 yuan, while Xin Tong Heng was at 388 yuan, reducing the purchase price by about 11 yuan.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Increases by Another 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange notes suddenly rose again, hovering around 200 yuan per thousand yuan all day, with uncertain fluctuations. Early in the morning, it was as high as 190 yuan. Those in need of cash were willing to pay a high price to discount their notes, causing it to soar to 210 yuan. It gradually returned to 195 yuan near noon. In the afternoon, it once again rose to 200 yuan, finally closing at 195 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous day. The Shanghai Money Industry Association's interbank lending rate remained unchanged at 0.2% in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>

<h3>Rice Merchants Are Fighting Limit Pricing; Rice Firms Advise Compliance with Limit Prices; Rice Shops Adopt a Passive Stance; Transport and Marketing Cooperation Manipulates the Shanghai Rice Market</h3>
<p>Since off-market transactions became prevalent, breaking limit prices and soaring to 23-24 yuan, most rice shops still sell at the limit price. However, under the current circumstances, it is impossible to purchase goods at the limit price, putting rice firms in a difficult situation. Yesterday, they advised fellow rice firms in the market to register and suspend transactions that exceeded the limit price, pending handling by the concession authorities. The situation was tense, and market operations were suspended again. However, according to industry insiders, industry firms are in an intermediate position, transferring goods with rice firms for only a commission of .011 yuan. Limit prices being exceeded is a matter of rice firms breaking their own rules, allowing traders to hoard goods for speculation. If rice firms can comply with the limit price, then where is the room for industry firms in the middle to raise prices? In short, such situations only consider one's own private interests, without considering the people's food, leading to the current situation. Since market transactions were effectively suspended, yesterday they called several famous rice mills to buy rice, asking "Do you have good rice?" The answer was, "No." Asked, "What is the price of rice?" the answer was "20 yuan." Asked "Is the rice good?" the answer was "Not tasty." Further questions received no response. Asking five or six shops yielded the same response, suggesting that the rice shops had prepared their answers in advance. The question remained as to how they managed to "speak in unison." However, according to investigations, the rice mills of a certain large rice factory on Mei Bai Ge Road have been grinding rice all day long, and the second floor is piled high with bags. How can they say that there is no rice? However, they are unwilling to sell it for 20 yuan per picul. It is likely that old customers can buy it, with old stock at 21.34 yuan and fresh stock at around 22 yuan. However, if one is a new customer or asks by telephone, they all answer that there is no stock. The rice shops are being so cautious, fearing that someone will investigate and say they are violating the limit price. In fact, this kind of behavior is nothing more than an attempt to relax the limit price, and even a one or two yuan increase is not enough to satisfy their desires. After the rice panic following the August 13th incident, rice shops learned their lesson and do not want to keep too much rice in their shops or publicly store rice in their warehouses, as they can be investigated. Therefore, they distribute the rice in various places to avoid scrutiny and ensure safety. Now, they are coordinating with rice dealers. Rice dealers are unwilling to show samples unless they are guaranteed a certain amount of sales. Rice shops are claiming that they cannot get any rice, selling off all their existing stock. Transport and marketing cooperation is manipulating the Shanghai rice market, causing even more public anxiety, unwittingly falling into the rice merchants' trap, allowing rice merchants to speak with confidence, and the limit price is relaxed without even being requested. Earlier, there was still a lot of rice in the hands of customers and traders, so rice merchants also advocated registering national households. Afterwards, the customers' rice was gradually sold off due to mold and steaming, and it has already entered the hands of rice merchants. Therefore, there is no news of pursuing the traders anymore. In short, there are two reasons for the rise in rice prices. Rice merchants want to raise the price of locally produced rice to the same level as imported goods. Secondly, they collude with certain parties, echoing each other and performing a "duet" to threaten the lives of Shanghai residents, forcing them to return to the mainland in order to fulfill a certain party's plan to "revive" the mainland. Under these circumstances, there was no trade in goods yesterday. River rice arrived, arriving from the South Port Gang No. 4, with cartwheel bags of South Gang goods, 1,100 to 1,200 bags.</p>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial customer rice market was already extinct. Due to the Rice Shop Association dispatching personnel to advise rice shops not to buy above the limit, there were no unofficial transactions for Jingwu high rice, which was at 18-19 yuan a few days ago. The transactions for rough rice at 16 yuan and below were also few. Also, it is rumored that there is hope that Wumi will be re-authorized, and the public's confidence in the market is returning, and the asking price is slightly flatter.</p>
<p>Imported Rice – The production prices differ greatly, so new transactions will be difficult to realize in the short term. The dealers' minds are very strong, and there is no sample of new or old Saigon rice.</p>
<h3>Flour Is Sold for Cash Only; Wheat Rises Another 2 Jiao</h3>
<p>Flour – Northern ocean firms transferred up to 50,000 bags of flour over several days. Therefore, the factories temporarily stopped supplying flour. On the other hand, they raised the wholesale price on the market again, from 5.2 Jiao to 5.3 Jiao. Basic/customer purchases are only cash-based. Therefore, yesterday's transactions only amounted to about 20,000 bags purchased by local firms and scattered firms from the interior. There are 27,000 bags being transported to Tianjin today.</p>
<p>Wheat – The amount of existing stocks is less than in previous years, so the market price rose by 1 Jiao. It is estimated that Fukufu and Liang factories bought 5 carts of Jingwu, Danyang and other wheat, at prices of 7 to 6.85 yuan. Hoarding firms bought 6 carts of Nanjing, Puzhen, Suzhou, Kunshan and other wheat, at prices of 7.25 to 6.85 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<h3>Also Related to the Newly Printed Banknotes: Yarn Prices Soar; Double Horse Breaks the 600 Yuan Barrier</h3>
<p>The rise in the yarn market is strangely rapid, because a stream of positive news is arriving on the market. It is said that English companies in London are undertaking to print a very large amount of Chinese legal tender, foreign exchange is shrinking, and gold is rising again, stimulating confidence. The buying momentum is suddenly vigorous, and the market is temporarily dry. Sellers are at a loss, and capital is becoming increasingly scarce. The market price is therefore rising sharply, and new peaks are emerging endlessly. 20-count Double Horse breaks through 603 yuan, 7 yuan higher than the previous trading day's opening price. The distance between less popular yarns and popular goods is widening. Therefore, although the price is cheap, general operators do not buy yarn in bulk, because their trend is too stagnant.</p>
<p>Spot yarn immediately rises by 5-6 yuan at the market opening. 20-count Double Horse warehouse receipts are 576 yuan, and existing spot yarn on the spot market is 590 yuan. Rumors are soon flying, and buyers are rushing to be first, and the market is driven by this momentum. There is an image of yarn shortages, and selling prices are advancing section by section. In an instant, Double Horse passes 600 yuan, but secret, shouted buying voices are still the most common. Until the closing price, the highest price is 603 yuan, and warehouse receipts are 591 yuan. The market is up 17 yuan for 20-count Double Horse, 13.5 yuan for Shepherd, and 15 yuan for Double Earth. Shenxin factory opened with 1,900 bags of 20-count Double Horse, at a price of 590 yuan, with a deposit of 10 foreign yuan per bag. Today, 1,370 cotton yarn pieces are transported to Tianjin, 5 pieces to Hong Kong, 190 pieces to Beihai, 65 pieces to Haiphong, and 110 pieces to Siam. The amount purchased by the various firms is listed below:</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market is also soaring. Upon investigation, this is because there is a spot yarn shortage and hoarding merchants are accumulating stocks. Also, there are many rumors, and buyers are willing to crowd in. The opening price for 20-count Yueqin was 467 yuan this month, and the closing price was 472 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton is Entirely</h3>
<h3>Collected by Japanese Merchants: Fire Machine Flower Opens at 95 Yuan</h3>
<p>Transactions for Chinese and foreign cotton continue to progress. Japanese factories are buying large amounts from firms. The complexity of their collection is double the scale of Chinese factories. Sales prices are therefore rising step by step. Market prices have risen another 3-4 yuan compared to what they were. The Chinese merchant Xinyu factory bought 600 bales of Tongzhou-packed cotton, at a price of 95 yuan (delivered to the warehouse in banknotes). Other merchants are actively buying and selling between themselves. 200 bales of Fire Machine Flower have also been transacted, at a price of 95 yuan (delivered to the warehouse in banknotes). Sources of cotton in Northern Jiangsu are thriving again. 631 bales of fine cotton from Tongzhou have arrived. The current situation for current cotton transactions is recorded below.</p>
<p>Another report says that transactions for foreign cotton in Shanghai have become bustling in recent days. Although Chinese factories also have small amounts of transactions, Japanese factories purchase the large majority. Nearly half of the ready goods owned by merchants has been purchased by Japanese factories. The gradual increase in selling prices in recent days is because the current stock in the city is being depleted day by day. It is predicted that cotton prices still have the potential to rise in the coming days.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was initially very quiet. Later, due to news of price drops from Liverpool, speculators seized the opportunity to buy, while small short covering orders arose at the same time. Midway, Liverpool and Bombay reported good news, and weather reports from cotton-growing regions were bad. Therefore, the market temporarily turned good. When the market closed, it ultimately fell due to the dumping of cotton by overseas merchants and short-covering, and prices fell 7-10 British points compared to the previous trading day. Indian shipping is expected to fall 1 Rupee, and Egyptian cotton will rise 7-8 British points.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Continue to Advance, Domestic Bonds Fall More Severely</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities gray market saw continued declines, which were more severe than before. More transactions are occurring, but they are still not very lively. Generally, people think that foreign exchange is tightening again and gold is rising, but according to precedent, government bond market prices generally move in the opposite direction. In fact, given the already realized currency inflation, and the recent order of 100 million banknotes from the United Kingdom, the amount of currency in circulation will increase even more in the future. The discount will naturally trend to a standard level, and credit will also naturally loosen. Therefore, the bond market has good prospects, but it is feared that it will not be achieved in a short amount of time. Yesterday, due to special reasons, the issuance of Numbers 11 and 49 was most vigorous, and there was also selling in Numbers 25 and 42. Runli also had a slight supply. Numbers 5 and Hengfu Tiansheng were buying the most, and individual investors were also absorbing a fair amount. As a result, prices continue to fall, falling between 7.5 Jiao and 1.1+ yuan. The total number of transactions is estimated to be 400,000-500,000 yuan. London Chinese foreign bonds are still steady, with no change. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: 50 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company shares were transacted, at a price of 8.55 yuan.</p>
<p>Another report from the Shanghai Public Exchange said that the stock market continued to advance yesterday morning, and prices increased. The transaction prices for ordinary stocks were slightly higher. Transactions of British Jardine Matheson rubber stocks were particularly active, and the closing transaction price was 24.25 yuan. The rise in stock prices seems to be due to the slight tightening of foreign exchange, leading to more buying sentiment for various rubber stocks.</p>
<p>On the 4th of this month (Friday), the listed market prices of stocks for British Far East companies in London had further declines. The price of shares in the Mercantile Bank of India declined by 2 shillings and 6 pence, to 6 pounds and 15 shillings. The price of Hong Kong-registered shares in HSBC Bank declined by 1 pound, to 76 pounds. Rubber shares in Gula Kerling (Kuala Gula) declined by 4.5 pence, to 17 shillings and 9 pence. There were no other changes.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes</h3>
<h3>Raw Oil Sales Are Thriving; Prices Increase Sharply by 2-3 Yuan; Soybean Oil Market Slightly Recovers</h3>
<p>Sales of raw oil to various firms in the city, Hong Kong and the interior have suddenly increased. The market price increased sharply by 2-3 yuan. A total of 300 pieces of Jiaozhou Loulou packed oil were transacted, at 43 yuan, and 41-42 yuan for oil transferred to the warehouse. 4,700 Cans of Qingdao tinned oil were transacted, with prices rising from 51 yuan to 53.5 yuan. Also, 55 barrels of barrelled oil were sold at 54 to 55.5 yuan, 12 barrels of second-packaged oil were sold at 53.7 yuan, and 200 Cans of Tianjin tinned oil at 51 yuan.</p>
<p>The soybean oil market has become slightly stable. A shipment of oil from Kobe, even with delivery costs added in, was 47.8 yuan. Over 500 barrels were transacted. Jiaozhou Loulou packed oil rose by .3 yuan, to 34.3 yuan, and 200 pieces were transacted.</p>
<p>Exports: On the 6th, 380 bags of soybeans and 700 bags of peanut kernels will be transported to Xiangman Port.</p>
<h3>Textiles</h3>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Purchasing Suddenly Booms: Longtou Fine Cloth Sets New Price</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: The foreign exchange market has tightened sharply, and thoughts of transacting are very vigorous. Heavyweight coarse cloth and coarse twill have risen by about .5 yuan, and light weight coarse cloth has risen by about 0.15 yuan. Fine cloth and fine twill factory prices have risen by .5 yuan. Many are still refusing orders. Second-hand goods in the market have been raised by at least 0.2-0.3 yuan. Dyed cloth and dyed twill sales have temporarily stopped because the price of white cloths has changed so drastically. Market firms, dyeing factories, and hoarding firms in this street bought more than 500 pieces of white fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth during the day. They also bought over 200 pieces of bleached cloth and unfinished cloth. Customer demand is not vigorous. Firms from Shandong bought 50 bags of 16-pound coarse cloth, firms from Sichuan and Yunnan bought over 10 boxes of printed fabric, and firms from Guangdong and Hong Kong bought over 100 pieces of Begee, colored twill, Red Mark, and fine twill. Firms from Subei Taizhou bought over 2,000 pieces of fine cloth and colored cloth. Firms from the interior, such as Changzhou and Hangzhou, bought 3,000-4,000 pieces of colored cloth, coarse cloth, Yuchou, Begee, and Zhigong.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Although actual sales of fine cloth and fine twill have been weak yesterday, hoarding has become even more vigorous. Everyone is eagerly buying, driving prices higher. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth hit a new record of 17.25 yuan this month. The next month's price is 17.45 yuan. Mid-level and lower-level miscellaneous-brand fine cloths have also jumped by 0.5-0.6 yuan per piece. Fine twill is up 0.25-0.5 yuan per piece. In the end, capital was depleted, and only 500-600 pieces were transacted in this street. Gongda Yarn Mill opened with 300 bags of 12-pound Dragon Pearl fine cloth spot goods, at 16.25 yuan. Yiteng booked 100 bags of Flying Fish fine cloth for the next month, at a price of 16.8 yuan. The price for the next month's order actually requires a massive 17.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Exports: On the 6th, 6 textiles were exported to Hong Kong, 6 to Guangzhou Bay, 55 to Beihai, and 285 to Xuanxuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: There Are Rumors of Added Taxes on Sugar</h3>
<h3>Imported Sugar Universally Recovers</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, according to a London wire, closed at 0.575 to 0.75 British points. December at 5 shillings, 11.575 British points; March of next year at 6 shillings, 0.025 British points; June at 6 shillings, 0.01 British point. In this city, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce transaction was done on the premise that prices had been steadily falling for the past few days and firms had resumed their appetite for transactions. For this reason, the price for re-exported goods of No. 24 raw white sugar, one of the grades, rose again one yuan to approximately 24.35 yuan in total for 200 bags, plus another 200 bags traded at 24.6 yuan; it finally rose to 25 yuan and 200 bags. Spot sugar rose .7 yuan, with this warehouse's at 33 yuan, and the outside warehouses' at 32.8 yuan. Tai Koo car white rose unevenly by .3-.5 yuan. Dongzhan's "B" mark was at 37.5 yuan; Xizhan's at 38 yuan, C.W. mark at 37.5, C.X. mark at 37.3, D.Y. mark at 37, H.X. mark at 36.8, H mark sugar and car mine were still at 22.5 yuan. Dutch red carmine's existing cash was at 28.5 yuan, a rise of two Jiao and re-export at 22, up by 3 Jiao. The stock of Main cotton white of Zhengji (Brand) No. 1 was 33 yuan, and brands No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 were the same as before. Wood No. 1 Crystal Brand at 39 yuan, and Jing Ming Crystal Brand at 40.5 yuan, both rising by a half yuan. Upon investigation, imported sugar rose due to rumors of increased taxes in Tianjin. Also, this city fears the related connection, hence the raise.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Heavy Taxes and Levies Make it Difficult to Lower Silk Prices</h3>
<p>Recently, the overseas silk market has been affected by the New York raw silk statistics for the past month, which showed an increase of more than 10,000 bales of silk in stock in the United States. The prices of silk in both Japan and the United States have simultaneously declined. The spot price of 85-fineness Japanese silk has fallen by 9 fen since July 31st of last month, while 75-fineness silk has fallen by 8 fen. Guangdong silk has fallen by 6 fen. The spot price of Shanghai silk has not yet been released. The recent futures price in New York has fallen slightly by 1 jiao and 0.05 li, while the long-term price has fallen by 9 fen. The spot price in Yokohama fell by 20 yuan yesterday, a decrease of 65 yuan compared to the end of July, while the long-term price fell by approximately 20 yuan. The impact has reached Shanghai. Furthermore, with the exchange rate gradually stabilizing, the exchange rate in Shanghai is lower than the previous week. However, the Shanghai silk market has various complex reasons of its own (such as white silk factories from the interior needing to pay a donation of 200 yuan when coming to Shanghai, plus 15 yuan for transportation fees, and nearly 20 yuan for certain movement fees, etc.). Therefore, the price of silk has not decreased accordingly, and the silk market has quietly entered a wait-and-see situation.</p>
<p>Today, there are 15 shipments of raw silk being transported to Hong Kong, as well as 10 shipments of tea.</p>

<h3>Due to the Evil Deeds of Traitors, the Market Fluctuated Again Yesterday: Facts Prove That the Legal Tender Reserve is Sufficient; There is No Inflation Phenomenon in the Market</h3>
<p>Since the Chinese government has been making every effort to maintain the value of the legal tender, the national finance has become more and more stable. Now, due to a rumor that the British are printing Chinese banknotes, traitors in the Shanghai financial market are causing disturbances. However, facts prove that there is no inflation. It is hoped that all sectors will have no doubts. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Evil Deeds of Traitors Cause Market Fluctuations</p>
<p>Since Reuters in London reported that the Chinese government and two British banknote printing companies had signed a contract to print more than 100 million banknotes, speculators in the Shanghai financial market deliberately spread rumors and manipulated the market in order to profit. As a result, huge fluctuations occurred in the black market for foreign exchange, the black market for gold, etc. (1) In the black market for foreign exchange, the exchange rate posted by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation remained unchanged, but the actual market rate shrank, with the exchange rate for British currency being 4 pence and 25, and the exchange rate for US currency being 8.25 yuan. (2) In the black market for securities, the closing prices in the morning were 54.40 yuan for Unified Class A, 43.80 yuan for Class B, 41.85 yuan for Class C, 40.03 yuan for Class D, and 41.01 yuan for Class E, a decrease of 0.70 yuan to 1.50 yuan. (3) The closing price of gold was 3,855 yuan.</p>
<p>Facts Prove That There is No Inflation</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the issuance of Chinese legal tender totaled 26,269,293,300 yuan by the end of June this year. The cash reserve is above 44%, which is still higher than the cash reserves of most countries. Moreover, the government has repeatedly stated that it is determined to maintain the value of the legal tender with all its strength, and has made full preparations for the occupied areas. All foreign payments are still based on the legal tender. Some parties may fear inflation, but the government's measures are the opposite of this. The legal foreign exchange rate has always been maintained, and there is a feeling of insufficient chips in the various markets, with no phenomenon of inflation.</p>
<p>Maintaining the Legal Tender Earns Praise</p>
<p>The credit of Chinese legal tender has always been unshakeable, and it is sufficient to strengthen the people's belief in the legal tender, which can indirectly strengthen the people's belief in the government. Now, the people in the occupied areas are all happy to hide legal tender in order to protect their property. This is due to the maintenance of the credit of the legal tender. Therefore, the government has never resorted to monetary policy for the War of Resistance, and has earned the praise of Chinese and foreign figures for opening up tax sources, such as establishing new taxes and reorganizing old taxes, and issuing various public bonds. Maintaining the value of the legal tender is especially praised by all parties, because if the legal price of the legal tender is broken, not only will the government lose a very good asset, but it will also lose the people's belief in the government.</p>
<p>Adding New Banknotes Has Two Meanings</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Newspaper says that regarding the Chinese government's order of more than 100 million banknotes from two banknote printing companies in London, although the local Chinese banking community has not received the news, a well-known banker recently told reporters and provided several suggestions for reference regarding the intention of the Chinese authorities to print these banknotes: (1) All or part of the new currency may be "foreign exchange" currency, which is circulated by China in the Chinese market exclusively for the purchase of foreign exchange, so as to prevent the people from exchanging legal tender for foreign exchange, which would benefit the Japanese. If this suggestion becomes a reality, then no one in the country may purchase foreign exchange without Chongqing's approval. (2) Chongqing's printing of new banknotes may be aimed at replacing the old and damaged banknotes currently in circulation. The banker claimed that when he was in the United States, he saw an American banknote printing company printing 500 million banknotes per day. This does not mean that the United States needs so many new currencies every day. Bankers who order a large number of new banknotes may circulate them in the market from time to time to replace the old banknotes withdrawn from the market.</p>
<h3>Taking Strict Precautions to Prevent Disturbances on "August 13th": All Defense Forces Have Agreed on Preventive Measures; All Troops and Detectives Stationed in Shanghai Will Be Mobilized</h3>
<p>The second anniversary of the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle is approaching in the blink of an eye. Because the police authorities of the two concessions had several incidents of hooligans disrupting newspapers last month, they took joint precautions in late last month and dispatched armored vehicles and detectives to conduct emergency searches at any time, which was quite effective. Therefore, the authorities will still implement this special measure during this anniversary period to ensure security within the boundaries. At the same time, from today until the 16th, any gatherings, associations, parades, and other activities of any organization will be prohibited for 11 days. During this period, detectives will be stationed in various public places to monitor. It is heard that some roads will still be blocked, mobilizing the garrison troops and the armored vehicles of the business community to patrol the districts, and paying special attention to the defense of areas adjacent to the Chinese territory. The martial law will be strictly enforced, and posts and patrols will be increased on various roads to strengthen the defense. The Japanese have also added barbed wire and other obstacles on various bridges in Hongkou and in quiet places in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Various Defense Forces Discuss Detailed Rules for Martial Law</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Newspaper says that the commanders of the various defense forces in Shanghai met yesterday morning (the 4th) to discuss the detailed rules for the precautions to be taken here to avoid any unforeseen events on the anniversary of the Shanghai Battle from August 9th to 13th. This decision on precautions is somewhat different from last year's precautions, but the specifics are not yet known. According to reliable sources, the precautions this year may be slightly tightened due to the possible attempts of existing terrorists in the two concessions, but they will be somewhat similar to last year's methods. It is also heard that although the curfew will be strictly enforced during the period of martial law, it will not be advanced.</p>
<p>The Entire City of Shanghai is Fully Mobilized</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times says that in view of the recent numerous bold terrorist incidents in the two concessions and the areas outside the boundaries, and the armed hooligans are using the concessions and the Chinese territory for political activities, it is heard that the authorities of the two concessions will continue to strengthen precautionary measures on the second anniversary of the August 13th Shanghai Battle. According to some sources, the entire city of Shanghai will be mobilized to cope with this emergency period.</p>
<p>Taking Special Protective Measures</p>
<p>However, official sources only report that the authorities are carefully studying the situation and will repeat the precautions for the anniversary. August 13th is a Sunday and the second anniversary of the outbreak of war in the Shanghai area. It is widely believed that terrorists will try to use this day to engage in activities. Past experience has shown that such anniversaries often lead to acts of violence, so special precautions and protective measures must be taken, otherwise disturbances are almost inevitable.</p>
<p>Strict Curfew and Searches Everywhere</p>
<p>It is expected that the state of emergency for the anniversary in the concession area will extend from August 9th to 15th, during which a strict curfew will be enforced. The authorities of the two concessions will cooperate closely, as with the current active control of Edward Road. Stone fortifications have been built at several key points, and troops will be stationed in the fortifications to defend them during the anniversary. The barbed wire obstacles that are now commonly seen will undoubtedly be erected at the entrances to the concessions. Although this may be inconvenient for the public, it has definitely proven to be important in assisting the military police in performing their duties. Pedestrians, vehicles, and the alleys and hostels where terrorists may hide or engage in secret discussions will be inspected.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Volunteer Corps is Actively Preparing</p>
<p>Close watch will be maintained on places where violence has occurred in the past and commercial institutions that have received threatening letters. The US Marine Corps, British and French troops, and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will all be mobilized and will operate in their respective defense zones. It is believed that all units of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will engage in active military duties, not just be on standby. The White Russian Unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will operate in the central area of the Bund and the Old City area, and guard the obstacles. The reserve team of the police department will also be called out to perform active duties.</p>
<p>Entertainment Venues Will Also Be Closed</p>
<p>During this emergency period, most Chinese rooftop gardens and entertainment venues will be temporarily closed to commemorate the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle and to prevent undesirable elements from mixing with customers. Many theaters will also be closed on August 13th, as they were last year. In the area north of the Suzhou Creek, Japanese soldiers will conduct searches and patrols.</p>
<h3>Comforting Refugees and Commending Martyrs: People in Occupied Areas Suffer; Disaster-Stricken Refugees are Actively Being Relieved</h3>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, soldiers have sacrificed their lives and followed one another in death. Their loyalty and martyrdom are truly enough to move ghosts and gods and shock heaven and earth. If their deeds are allowed to be lost and not passed down, how can we commend loyalty and martyrdom? Therefore, a special order has been issued to investigate the military and civilians and officials who have died in the line of duty since the War of Resistance, and it is stipulated that in the future, whenever there are such incidents of death, a form should be filled out and presented at any time and on any occasion. Gatherings should be held to mourn the heroic deaths. Those who have died heroically and whose merits lie in the Party and the country should be reported to the local government for commendation in order to honor hidden virtues and encourage future generations. Furthermore, the people in the occupied areas have suffered all kinds of insults and humiliation, and must feel great pain in their spirits. After the recovery of the occupied counties and cities in each war zone, personnel should be sent immediately to comfort them, and together with the military and political authorities, actively relieve the disaster-stricken refugees.</p>
<h3>The Situation on North Jiangxi Road is Quiet; The Number of People Moving Has Decreased</h3>
<p>The residents of the shops and houses on North Jiangxi Road, from the north end of the Waterworks Bridge in the south to the east end of Old Bazi Road in the north, were extremely panicked when the area was blocked off by the Japanese. However, after a week, this panic has subsided. According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who patrolled the road yesterday morning, except for the Japanese soldiers on guard at the gap on Chongming Road and the group inside the gap on Haining Road, the gap on Wenjianshi Road has not been set up since the retreat. The residents have obviously decreased after moving for several days, so there are not many people moving today. Many smaller shops are operating as usual, and residents entering and exiting the gaps are still free. Chinese police are still stationed outside the gaps. Overall, the situation is still quiet.</p>
<p>The Principal and Interest of the Reviving Gold Bonds Due Will Be Discounted and Paid by the Four Banks; The Unified Class A Bonds Will Be Drawn on the 10th; Principal and Interest Will Be Repaid by the End of January Next Year: After the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks agreed to discount and pay for the principal and interest of the domestic debt secured by customs duties, the principal and interest of the Seventh Unified Public Bonds began to be paid on July 31st. The principal and interest of the Seventh Reviving Public Bonds have been scheduled to begin to be paid on August 31st. The principal and interest of the Twelfth Financial Long-Term Public Bonds have also been scheduled to begin to be paid on September 30th. As for the eighth repayment of principal and interest on the Unified Public Bonds, it has been scheduled to begin to be paid on January 30th next year. As for the drawing of lots, Class A bonds have been scheduled to be drawn on the 10th of August in Shanghai. The National Debt Fund Management Committee has sent letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Association, and other organizations, requesting them to send personnel to the venue to supervise. It is heard that 25 lots will be drawn, with a principal repayment of 4.4 million yuan. The various types of bonds, B, C, D, and E, have also been scheduled to be drawn separately.</p>
<h3>Gunfire in Jiangwan: Machine Gun Fire and Rifle Fire Continued Intermittently for Half a Day</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Newspaper says that heavy machine gun fire was heard in the Jiangwan area from 3 to 4 pm yesterday (the 4th), and intermittent rifle fire was heard from that area again at nearly 11 pm. As of late last night, the details were unknown.</p>
<h3>Fractional Currency Will Be Issued Soon, Fully Backed by Legal Tender</h3>
<p>The Central Bank, in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Finance, has signed a contract with the Hong Kong Wing Ning Printing Company to print 500,000 yuan of fractional currency notes to alleviate the shortage of copper auxiliary currency in the Shanghai market, including 300,000 yuan in one-fen notes and 200,000 yuan in five-fen notes. Once the printing is completed, the fractional currency notes will be issued, fully backed by legal tender. It is expected that the printing will be completed and delivered by mid-month, and the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank will be responsible for issuing and circulating them in the market. This is a temporary measure to alleviate the market situation. In the future, it is planned to issue aluminum coins.</p>
<h3>Although the Rice Market is Stalled, the Crackdown on Under-the-Table Deals Has Been Intensified: Arrivals Continue Uninterrupted, and Speculators Are Willing to Sell; Lack of Land Transport Vehicles Does Not Mean the Source Has Been Blocked</h3>
<p>The rice market has been in turmoil in recent days due to the scarcity of sources and the rice merchants' hoarding and speculation, unwilling to display japonica rice for sale in the market, resulting in rampant under-the-table deals. However, in order to maintain the people's food supply, the concession authorities continue to enforce price limits, investigate warehouse stocks, and crack down on hoarding, and the rice merchants have to be wary. According to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency, the japonica rice still accounts for half of the various types of rice in storage that were announced by the Soybean and Rice Industry Association. At the same time, boats arriving from the river continue uninterrupted, with more than 10 boats arriving on the 4th and 7 or 8 boats arriving on the 5th. As for land transportation, the arrivals are not numerous due to the lack of vehicles, not because the source has been blocked.</p>
<p>The Authorities are Considering Dredging the Source</p>
<p>Chen Ziyi and Zhu Zixiang, members of the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association, called on Vice-General Manager Ho De Kui of the Public Concession Bureau a few days ago. In addition to reporting on the Shanghai soybean and rice market situation, they requested (1) to find ways to dredge the source to allow rice from Wuhu and other places to be transported to Shanghai, and (2) to find ways to order and transport rice to Shanghai to relieve the situation, in order to maintain the food supply of Shanghai citizens. It is heard that the Public Concession Bureau has agreed to consider it, but it is determined to strictly enforce the price limits on food rice, and to allow reporting of rice shops that exceed the price limits at any time for investigation and handling.</p>
<p>Market Transactions are Tending to Stall</p>
<p>After the Fuzhou Road Qingyun Pavilion Soybean and Rice Market opened at 9:00 am yesterday, the transactions in the market were virtually stalled because the surveillance personnel stationed in the market strictly cracked down on under-the-table transactions, and each firm in the market had to sign, stipulating that white japonica rice should not exceed 20 yuan and guest indica rice should not exceed 16 yuan. If there is any violation, it will be handled. Therefore, the transactions in the market were virtually stalled, and under-the-table transactions were changed to direct negotiations outside the market. Therefore, only winter frost rice and other rice were traded in the market yesterday, and the number was very small.</p>
<h3>The Small Change Coupon of the Money Exchange Industry Has Been Properly Recovered: The Number is Limited; The Procedure is Simple</h3>
<p>The money exchange and cigarette exchange industries, because the 500,000 yuan of auxiliary currency notes printed by the Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank will soon be transported to Shanghai for issuance, the small change temporary coupon freely formulated by each firm when there was a shortage of copper fractional currency in the past should be recovered as soon as possible, so that the new coupon can arrive in Shanghai and unify the circulation in the market. According to a reporter from the Da Guang News Agency who inquired from the two industries yesterday, the temporary coupons issued by the member firms have been carefully recovered by the authorities of the two associations. Before the new coupon arrives in Shanghai, stamps can be used as much as possible to meet the urgent needs of the environment. It is heard that the number of temporary coupons distributed by the two industries is not large, and the recovery procedure is very simple.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of the Transport of Cube Sugar and Block Sugar</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance ordered the various customs offices, saying that the previously determined list of foreign goods prohibited from being imported during extraordinary times has been ordered to be followed. It is now found that the cube sugar and block sugar listed in No. 299 of the import tariff should also be included in the list of prohibited goods.</p>

<h3>Japanese Warships Bombed Zhenhai Yesterday; Shanghai Ships Opened to Qiliyu; The Oujiang Estuary Has Been Blocked with Sand and Stones; The Opening of Aojiang Can Be Decided in the Short Term</h3>
<p>The four ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line are currently in the Zhenhai Estuary. Yesterday, a certain shipping company in the city received a Ningbo military announcement stating that the Zhenhai Estuary was bombarded by Japanese warships the day before, with more than a dozen shells fired. Each ship opened to Qiliyu to avoid it, and the loading and unloading of passengers and goods was delayed. The Moufu and Baoli ships, which were originally scheduled to return to Shanghai today, will have to be postponed until Monday (the 7th) of next week due to the above-mentioned impact.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Bombarded</p>
<p>Japanese warships frequently come and go outside the Zhenhai Estuary. According to sources in the shipping industry, there is currently a Japanese warship anchored on the sea surface of Qiliyu, with no unusual movements yet. Two Japanese warships arrived on the sea surface of Ligang at 2 pm on the afternoon of the 3rd, put down speedboats and patrolled, and then opened to Xie Pei and fired more than a dozen shells on the shore without any reported losses. Three Japanese warships were anchored on the sea surface of Chuanshan, and fired seven or eight shells on the shore on the morning of the 4th.</p>
<p>The Oujiang River is Blocked</p>
<p>The Japanese have blockaded the Wenzhou shipping route. First, they used warships to patrol and prohibit any shipping from entering the Oujiang River. Currently, fishing boats have been used to carry sand and stones and sink them outside the Oujiang Estuary, effectively blocking the shipping. Therefore, the resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Wenzhou is factually impossible. The Shenguang ship did not complete this last voyage, and the round trip took a week. Fortunately, it did not load passengers or goods, and the loss was minimal.</p>
<p>Opening Aojiang</p>
<p>After the obstruction of the resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Wenzhou, the shipping industry has submitted a request to the authorities to open Aojiang in order to divert passenger and freight transport between Shanghai and Wenzhou. According to sources in the shipping industry, the authorities have agreed to consider it, and it is hoped that it can be realized in the short term. Various foreign shipping companies are processing registration procedures. Once approved, they can resume shipping. At that time, passenger and freight transport from various ports in Wenzhou can be rerouted.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee Member Mao Mianlu Passed Away; Public Memorial Service Will Be Held Today</h3>
<p>Mao Mianlu, a member of the Supervisory Yuan and a native of Ningbo, passed away in his native Fenghua last month. The central government has telegraphed condolences. Now, more than 30 of Mao's disciples in Shanghai, such as Cao Jingyuan, have scheduled a public memorial service at the Ningbo Shanghai Native Association on Yu Qiaqing Road at 9 am today to express their condolences.</p>
<h3>Zhaofeng Park Brass Band Concert</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Bureau Music Band will hold a brass band concert in Zhaofeng Park from 5:30 pm to 7:00 pm on the 6th (weather permitting). There will be seven items on the program.</p>
<h3>Mr. Pan Tanghua Talks About the Brisk Sales of National Products in the Nanyang Islands: Nearly One Million Overseas Chinese are Happy to Purchase and Use Them; Monthly Donations from Salaries and Wages Support the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>Mr. Pan Tanghua, manager of the Zhava Company in this city, has always been enthusiastic about promoting national products. He has made outstanding contributions to the success of national products being sold overseas. Mr. Pan left Shanghai on March 21st of this year to go abroad and inspect the sales situation of national products in the Nanyang Islands. Now that the inspection is completed, he arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the French postal ship President Doumer yesterday morning. Many national product manufacturers in the city went to the New Customs Wharf to welcome him. Mr. Chang Pan Zhihui, entrusted by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Medan, and Mr. Li Qiaoguang, a business tycoon in Singapore, also came to Shanghai with Mr. Pan to inspect the domestic national product business. The reporter visited Mr. Pan yesterday and was told about the experience of this trip and the current situation of the overseas Chinese in Nanyang, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Footprints Extend Throughout Nanyang</p>
<p>Mr. Pan first said that before the War of Resistance, China's national product business was developing daily, and domestic sales were also very prosperous. Places such as Yunnan, Hankou, Chongqing, Henan, Hebei, and Shandong usually purchased national products from Shanghai and Hong Kong. After the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle, all the coastal ports were blocked by the Japanese, and inland transportation was blocked, so the national product industry suffered a major blow. I deeply feel that the motherland's industry and commerce during the War of Resistance need to open up new paths in order to cultivate wartime production. This trip passed through Surabaya, Sampo, Long, Cirebon, Batavia (Jakarta) of the West Celebes Island of the Meng Java Islands, and Medan of Sumatra, and then went to Singapore and transferred to Hong Kong before returning to Shanghai.</p>
<p>National Products Sell Well in Markets Everywhere</p>
<p>The above-mentioned places were originally large markets for Japanese goods before the war. Since the War of Resistance, many Japanese workers have been engaged in the production of heavy industry, which has increased the cost of Japanese goods, compared to five to one before the war. National products have been able to sell well. Currently, 60% of the products in the Nanyang Islands are domestic products. Cotton products such as shirts and cotton shirts are all produced in Hong Kong. Sundries such as felt hats, blankets, thermos bottles, light bulbs, toothbrushes, socks, towels, handkerchiefs, undershirts, and balls are purchased from Shanghai. Among them, cotton textiles and towels and socks are the best-selling. However, the quality of cotton textiles in Hong Kong is better than that in Shanghai. It is hoped that manufacturers in this city will make improvements in this regard. There are branches of the Bank of China in Singapore and Medan, which makes it very convenient to remit money to purchase goods. Although the foreign exchange rate is changing, it has no impact on the sales of national products. Currently, 100 yuan of legal tender is approximately equal to 15 Dutch guilders.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Love Their Country and Boycott Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese's enthusiasm for caring about the victory of the motherland's War of Resistance is very moving. They are especially dedicated to the boycott of Japanese goods. Those who usually use Japanese goods now use national products. If overseas Chinese abandon national products and still use Japanese goods, they will first be warned and fined to donate to the national salvation fund. There are more than 2,000 "secret investigators" in Singapore who are specifically responsible for observing whether overseas Chinese are purchasing Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Huge Sums of Money Are Remitted to Support the Country</p>
<p>Of the various ports, Singapore, Medan, Batavia, and Makassar are the most prosperous. Singapore has 600,000 overseas Chinese, and Medan has more than 30,000. The Singapore authorities are still free to overseas Chinese. The Dutch are stricter, and the local economic department has restrictions on the import of national products. However, under certain circumstances, special accommodation can be requested. The British and Dutch governments are also very sympathetic to China's War of Resistance, and there have been no incidents of excessive suppression of patriotic actions by overseas Chinese. In Singapore, overseas Chinese have donated 20 million yuan, but the funds are raised in the name of the "Disaster Relief Association" locally. A portion of the monthly salary and wages of overseas Chinese is also deducted for donations. Mr. Pan and Mr. Li still need to stay in Shanghai for a period of time to inspect and plan the national product sales business.</p>
<h3>Cao Yi Elementary School Incident in West Shanghai: Japanese and Italian Authorities Reach Understanding; Japanese Troops Post Notices at School Gate; Japanese Prevent Activities Outside School</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, Japanese and Italian troops have taken control of Cao Yi Elementary School at 1081 Jessfield Road to prevent further disputes. Yesterday (the 4th), Japanese and Italian troops posted notices on the school gate, prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving. Reliable sources say this action was taken because another dispute arose at noon yesterday. The incident stemmed from Thursday morning when</p>
<p>Italian Troops Arrested</p>
<p>armed terrorists. At 2:00 PM on the same day, a Mr. Xu, believed to be the "Chief of Staff of the Special Service Corps," believing the dispute had ended and that the building could be used as an office for the "Special Service Corps," arrived at Cao Yi Elementary School with several others and their families in a truck carrying bedding, intending to</p>
<p>Occupy the Premises</p>
<p>At noon yesterday, Mr. Xu appeared outside the building with a weapon in hand, accompanied by another armed individual. They were immediately arrested by Italian troops. Since Thursday afternoon, the women who had moved into the building have not been seen leaving. The Japanese notice prohibits "entry" and exit, indicating that these individuals are still inside the building. Although no official announcement has been made, it seems that the Japanese and Italian authorities have</p>
<p>Reached an Understanding</p>
<p>stipulating that all activities take place inside the school gate (reportedly, inside the school gate is outside the boundary of the International Settlement). Italian troops are not to interfere, while the Japanese have ordered the "Special Service Corps" not to carry weapons such as broadswords, hand grenades, and Mauser pistols outside the gate.</p>
<p>The Continental Times reports that</p>
<p>the sixteen Chinese suspected terrorists arrested by Italian marines on Jessfield Road on Thursday morning were still detained at 62 Rue Robert, the Italian naval headquarters, last night (the 4th). This news, obtained from high-ranking authorities around 10:00 PM last night, contradicts earlier reports on Thursday that the Italian troops had handed over these individuals, believed to be members of the "Great Way" [Da Dao], to the Japanese and Italian military. Regarding this case, recent reports indicate that although the Japanese have</p>
<p>Negotiated for the Release</p>
<p>of these individuals with the Italian authorities, the Italian authorities have not yet agreed. Although well-informed sources believed last night that these individuals might be released or handed over to the Japanese, the Italian naval authorities in Shanghai are no longer responsible for this matter. It is now understood that the case has been transferred to the Italian Embassy for handling, making it a political rather than a military matter. Last night, some even suggested that the Italian government would be consulted before</p>
<p>Handing Over to the Japanese</p>
<p>these individuals and all their weapons. These individuals were arrested by Italian troops at 1081 Jessfield Road on Thursday morning and taken to the Italian military headquarters. The Japanese and Italian military and the "Great Way Government" have requested the release of these individuals. The Italian naval authorities have reported the matter to the Italian Embassy. According to the North-China Daily News,</p>
<p>Italian Marines</p>
<p>are guarding the premises at 1081 Jessfield Road, Jessfield Road, prohibiting anyone from approaching. Rumors that ten of the individuals immediately returned to the building after being released by the Italian troops have been denied. It is firmly stated that the premises will be guarded indefinitely by Italian marines. Commander Villalta of the Italian military headquarters, when questioned by reporters at noon yesterday, considered that this "slightly shocking event" that occurred on Thursday has now passed.</p>
<h3>Arrival of Passenger Liners in Shanghai: Canadian Empress, Russian Empress, and Luxury Liner Victoria</h3>
<p>The Canadian Pacific's Empress of Canada, which departed Shanghai for Hong Kong and Manila on the 25th of last month, is now on its return voyage and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today (the 6th) at 4:00 PM, docking at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. A tender will depart from the Customs Wharf today at 4:00 PM and return passengers to the Customs Wharf for landing around 5:30 PM. The main liner is scheduled to weigh anchor at 11:30 AM tomorrow (the 7th), heading to Japan and then returning to Canada via Honolulu. The final tender will depart from the Customs Wharf at 10:00 AM tomorrow morning. Additionally, the company's Russian Empress, which has sailed from Canada to the Far East, is expected to pass Nagasaki and arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 7th) around 4:00 PM, also docking at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. Passengers will disembark around 5:30 PM via a tender to the Customs Wharf. The main liner is scheduled to weigh anchor at 11:00 AM on the 8th, heading to Hong Kong and Manila. The final tender will depart from the Customs Wharf at 9:30 AM on the 8th. The Italian Line's Eurasia Line passenger liner Victoria, which departed from Genoa on the 13th of last month, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 7th) around 4:00 PM, docking at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. According to the company, it was expected to pass Hong Kong yesterday, but no report has been received from the liner. Therefore, whether it will arrive in Shanghai on time depends on the liner's telegram today for accurate information.</p>
<h3>Sand and Gravel Shipments to Shanghai Blocked; Contracts Cannot Be Fulfilled; Shanghai Construction Industry's Orders and Contracts; Sand and Gravel Industry Declares Temporary Inability to Deliver</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She [New Voice Society], sand and gravel in the Shanghai concessions, which were previously shipped from Sansi Reef and other places, are now being impounded due to the Japanese implementation of control, leading to a depletion of sand and gravel in the concessions and affecting the local construction industry. The Shanghai Sand and Gravel Trade Association issued an urgent statement yesterday stating, "Due to the illegal and forcible impoundment of all sand and gravel shipments to Shanghai, the concessions are now devoid of sand and gravel. Our association's members are unable to fulfill contracts or orders with the construction industry. In addition to requesting assistance from the authorities, as this is an extraordinary event, it is beyond our capabilities. We hereby issue this solemn statement, hoping that the construction industry will grant understanding. We respectfully seek your understanding."</p>
<h3>Overview of the Fire in Datuan Town</h3>
<p>During the recent large-scale offensive launched by guerrillas in the southern part of Pudong, Datuan Town was once captured. As the two sides engaged in close combat, fires broke out in various parts of the town. Over two consecutive nights, Datuan Town suffered unprecedented devastation. According to villagers who came to Shanghai, starting from the residence of Zhai A-san in the Lower Pond area and extending north to the residence of Shao Xin-guan, a total of forty to fifty houses were destroyed. Starting from Zhai Song-sheng's mat shop on New Street and extending south, hundreds of commercial buildings, including smoke shops, paper shops, oil and liquor stores, general merchandise stores, fish markets, and small and large shops, were destroyed. The Zhou surname's sugar mill and residence across from the Yangxin Temple were destroyed, and over ten thatched houses in the Taoist temple were burned. Many civilians perished in the chaos.</p>
<h3>Pawnshops in Western Shanghai Oppose Counterfeit Taxes; Taxation Based on Pawned Capital; Tax Rates Excessively High</h3>
<p>The twenty-nine pawnshops on the Yuejie Quyao Road [Outside the Border Road] area in western Shanghai are now facing the "Finance Bureau" levying a so-called "business tax." Personnel have been dispatched to each pawnshop to record the pawned capital, with tax rates ranging from one to three per thousand of the pawned capital. The pawnshop industry in the area considers the tax rates excessively high, making them unbearable and difficult to find relief. Moreover, during the Shanghai Municipal Government era, the business tax paid by this industry was calculated based on the amount of capital, but it is now calculated based on the amount of pawned capital, which is a significant difference. Therefore, they strongly oppose it. Furthermore, each pawnshop has obtained a license from the Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Autumn Flood Season Approaching; High Tides Cause for Concern; Huangpu River Not Dredged, Riverbed Rising Daily; Water Level Increasing Sharply</h3>
<p>Starting from the eighth of this month, the Huangpu River will enter the autumn flood season. Every year at this time, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River experience snowmelt, causing the river water to rise. The mouth of the Wusong River is the tail end, so if the water level outside the mouth is high, the Huangpu River will also be affected. At the same time, during this period, due to the close proximity of the moon to the earth, the tides are pulled higher, so there are usually high tides. Especially this year, the Huangpu River has not been dredged, and the number of hurricanes is also higher than in previous years. If these two factors coincide with the high tide season, then the flooding situation in Shanghai is extremely worrying. Even without hurricanes, the height of the Huangpu Riverbed is unprecedented since the establishment of the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau. Therefore, a sharp increase in the water level is expected. If the weather is bad, high tides are easily triggered. At a minimum, water will accumulate on the roads, and it will take a long time to recede. The autumn flood high tide period will greatly inconvenience travel.</p>
<h3>Town Chief of Fahua Town Abducted</h3>
<p>The current town chief of Fahua Town, Ma Hengbin (also known as Shao Liang, a native of Zhenjiang), previously sought temporary refuge in Zhoujiaqiao in western Shanghai due to difficult handling of affairs. However, on the morning of the day before yesterday, Ma was suddenly abducted by more than ten armed men while in town. Afterwards, the family received a letter demanding a large sum of money for his release. After some negotiation, a compromise could not be reached due to the difference in the amount.</p>
<h3>Boy Scout Lu Shihua Sacrifices His Life in the Line of Duty; Family Urgently Awaits Assistance and Compensation</h3>
<p>Lu Shihua, a Boy Scout from Shanghai, was killed in action when Nanchang fell. A representative from the Shanghai Boy Scout Council visited his home to investigate and console his father, Lu Jincai, who is in his sixties and supports himself through peddling. His only son, Shihua, was originally a trainee at a bank. Inspired by patriotism during the war of resistance, he secretly left home and joined the Shanghai Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps. After withdrawing westward with the army, he experienced the hardships of the battles of the capital and Xuzhou. Unfortunately, he died a heroic death in the Battle of Nanchang. His elderly father is still unaware that his beloved son has sacrificed his life for the country. Many kind-hearted people in Shanghai are able to introduce his elderly father to positions such as gardener or gatekeeper to spend his remaining years in peace. This would be a great act of merit. His address in Shanghai can be obtained from the Shanghai Xu Garden Refugee Middle School on Kang Nao Tuo Road [Connaught Road].</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province's Tea Purchases Changed to China Tea Company; Over 10,000 Dan Collected in War Zones; Strict Prevention of Smuggling</h3>
<p>The purchase of tea in Zhejiang Province, originally entrusted by the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance to the Provincial Oil, Tea, Cotton, and Silk Management Office, has now been changed to the China Tea Company starting in the second half of the year. Therefore, the tea department of the Management Office has been reorganized. From now on, the business part of the tea department will be the responsibility of the China Tea Company. The Zhejiang Oil, Tea, Cotton, and Silk Management Office purchased approximately 10,000 dan of tea in various counties in the war zone this year. Approximately 4,000 dan have already been transported to the rear. This number did not reach the original target. Inconvenient transportation in the war zone and a reduction in coolies were important reasons for the difficulty in purchasing. Smuggling is also unavoidable. Currently, the authorities in this area have taken note and are preventing it to maintain resources.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Seeks to Aid Railway Employees Who Lost Jobs</h3>
<p>Since the National Army withdrew from Shanghai, the Jinghu [Nanjing-Shanghai], Huhangyong [Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo], Pinghan [Beijing-Hankou], and Jinpu [Tianjin-Pukou] Railways have successively fallen, causing most of the railway employees to lose their jobs. The various railway unions had petitioned the Ministry of Railways for relief to maintain their livelihoods. Recently, the Ministry of Railways sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate the situation of the employees in detail. The authorities have formulated relief measures for the unemployed employees and will provide placement or maintain their livelihoods. The investigation has now been completed and has moved to the Suzhou, Jiaxing, and Hangzhou areas to conduct similar investigations.</p>
<h3>China International Famine Relief Commission; Relief News from Anhui Province; Allocation of 20,000 Yuan for Emergency Relief; Still Seeking Donations from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission at 97 Renji Road, Shanghai, has recently received many letters from various parts of northern Anhui requesting the allocation of funds for relief, stating that after the war, it was followed by a year of famine. The people are suffering from famine, and the number of people starving to death is increasing daily. According to the two reports from the World Red Swastika Society in April and May of this year, the number of famine-stricken areas in northern Anhui that urgently need relief has increased to twenty-seven districts. The China International Famine Relief Commission has specially tried to investigate the famine situation in each of these areas and how to provide relief and post-disaster rehabilitation methods. The commission has now allocated 20,000 yuan to entrust the implementation of emergency relief in some of the most severely affected areas. However, the funds are small, and the disaster is huge, so the effectiveness is very limited. It is still seeking donations from all benevolent people to provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Protection Work for July</h3>
<p>Last month, the Child Protection Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council handled a total of 73 cases, including 54 new cases, classified as follows: (1) Vagrancy, abandonment, and lost children: 12 cases; (2) Abduction: 5 cases; (3) Prostitution, child prostitution, and rape: 9 cases; (4) Beggars and thieves arrested: 17 cases; (5) Assault or abuse: 4 cases; (6) Maids: 4 cases; (7) Other: 3 cases. Classified by gender, there were 17 boys, 35 girls, and 2 young married women. Classified by age, there were 3 over 20 years old, 12 over 15 years old, 21 over 10 years old, 12 over 5 years old, and 6 under 5 years old. 33 of these children were handed over to foster care organizations, 11 were returned to their relatives, and the disposition of 9 was undecided. 13 children who were begging on the streets or guarding cars were arrested by the police. These children do not have normal families, and most of them live in the alleyways at night. The Child Protection Association has taken steps to provide relief to these child beggars and plans to establish a school to accommodate them. A foreman who employed laborers was found to have abused child labor, and with conclusive evidence, the police filed a lawsuit, and the court sentenced him to three months of imprisonment. Last month, a total of 249 child offenders violated criminal law and penal law, including 181 boys and 68 girls and young women. In addition, there were 74 child offenders who violated the regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Council, all of whom were tried and sentenced by the Shanghai First Special District Court.</p>
<h3>Notice for Mailing Letters: Addresses Must Be Detailed and Clear; One Stamp Should Be Affixed</h3>
<p>Since the National Army moved westward and order was restored in Shanghai, refugees from the suburbs and other places have flocked to Shanghai, causing the population of Shanghai to surge. In addition to the doubling of sales of daily necessities, the correspondence with other places has increased by about half. However, most residents, due to coming from remote rural areas, often do not specify the addresses for delivery of ordinary mail, express mail, and registered mail, causing the post office to be unable to deliver, delaying time, or inevitably causing loss. Moreover, traffic is blocked in various places, and postal transportation is difficult. Or even if the name and address of the recipient are clearly written, the address of the sender is only written as a certain box. Once the recipient has moved, it is impossible to return the letter. However, those who do not understand the situation often blame the post office for the poor delivery of mail. Yesterday, I learned from the Shanghai Postal Administration that for all kinds of letters delivered in the future, both the sender and the recipient must provide detailed names and addresses to avoid delay and loss. If they still fail to specify clearly, they will be refused acceptance. Moreover, Article 16 of the Postal Regulations stipulates that domestic mail should specify the province, city, county, township, town, street, lane, house number, and name. Also, regarding scattered stamps, due to the current shortage of copper coins, citizens use stamps as a substitute, so scattered stamps such as one-cent, two-cent, and five-cent stamps are circulating in the market in large numbers. However, the general public often affixes five one-cent stamps to a letter for ordinary mail. The post office has refused to accept this type of mail and stipulates that ordinary mail must have one five-cent stamp, registered mail must have one thirteen-cent stamp, and express mail must have one seventeen-cent stamp.</p>

<h3>Two Bullets Enclosed in Letter; Extortion of Candy Company; Seven Released Without Charge; Six Indicted According to Law</h3>
<p>The Xumeifeng Candy Company branch at 35 Baoyu Lane, Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, received a threatening letter on June 30, enclosing two bullets and demanding 5,000 yuan, stating, "We will use extreme measures to deal with you if you negotiate payment at the Guanle Tea House on Avenue Joffre on the afternoon of July 1," etc. The store owner reported the information to the French police, who sent detectives to arrest Wang Zhen, Chen Zhengshi, Chen A-jian, Chen Jinyu, Chen Lidao, Huang Ruocun, Li Zhiye, Shen Liansun, Xu Jiabin, Ma Yukun, Zhuang Zhenzhai, Chen Jianlong, Lin Lemei and other male and female suspects, thirteen in total, at the Guanle Tea House and 14 Yongqing Lane, Dongxinqiao Street, and other places. They also seized seals and certain documents at the Leidian Printing House, 11 Huage Nie Road [Route Wagner], and sent them to the Second Special Court for interrogation. The details have been recorded in previous reports. The investigation of this case has now been completed by the French Police Department. Yesterday morning, Chief Judge Liao of the Second Special Court presided over the trial in the First Criminal Court. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the French Concession Administrative Authority, stated that seven suspects, Ma Yukun, Chen Jianlong, Chen Zhengshi, Chen Lidao, Chen Liansun, Zhuang Zhenzhai, and Lin Lemei, were found to be unrelated to the case and would not be prosecuted. Wang Zhen, Chen Jinyu, Huang Ruocun, Xu Jiabin, Chen A-ji, and Li Zhiye were indicted for extortion and possession of military weapons and requested to be tried according to law. After the investigating detectives reported the details of the investigation, the court verified the report and ordered the unprosecuted defendants to be taken down. After questioning Wang Zhen and the other six one by one in detail, the hearing was adjourned to the 19th for further questioning. The defendants were returned to custody, and the seven unprosecuted defendants, including Ma Yukun, were to be released.</p>
<h3>Opium Discovered in Home of Cotton Yarn Merchant; Admits to Smoking, Denies Trafficking; Claims to Be Victim of Revenge</h3>
<p>Xu Jingzhi, a cotton yarn merchant from Suzhou, and his wife, Madame Wang, resided together at 12, Lane 289, Weihaiwei Road. Recently, Hua Detective Ye Yuxi, Detective Liu Zhaonian, and Li Shugui from the Anti-Narcotics Department of the General Inspectorate found that the Xu couple was privately selling opium. On the 2nd of this month, they first sent detectives to purchase half an ounce of opium from Xu Wangshi for seven yuan in legal tender, and then requested the First Special Court to issue a search warrant. At 9:00 AM on the 4th, they went to arrest Xu Jingzhi and his wife, Xu Wangshi, and seized four jars of opium, weighing seventeen ounces, a small amount of opium residue, fourteen seals, and a scale. They also found two pieces of Persian opium, weighing eighteen ounces, in a locked cabinet and took them to the police station separately for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, filed charges according to Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Opium Crimes, accusing them of selling opium, and stated the details of the case, saying that, according to the defendant Xu Jingzhi's confession at the police station, the opium was bought from Zheng Qiaji's opium shop, and a Hu surname was hired as a partner. Because the opium raw materials were not good, Persian opium was added, etc. When Xu Jingzhi was questioned, he</p>
<p>admitted to smoking but denied selling, and Xu Wangshi also confessed that her husband had a habit in the past but absolutely did not sell opium, and hired lawyers Xi Shichang and others to defend, stating that the case was actually due to a grudge and revenge. Xu Jingzhi had previously been involved in a lawsuit with Chen, the owner of Ding Taihe Yarn Shop, in your court's civil court. Chen lost the first instance, and the appeal was dismissed on July 30, causing</p>
<p>resentment. Chen once expressed that although the civil case had failed, he would get revenge one day because Xu smoked opium. Unexpectedly, two or three days later, this case occurred. The presiding judge concluded the debate on the case and scheduled the verdict for the 11th. The two defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Detectives; Extortion; Discovered and Arrested</h3>
<p>Rogues Yao Genlin (40 years old, Suzhou native, resident of 35 Shouan Lane, Baxianqiao), Lin Kunjin (41 years old, Changshu native, no address), Yao Wenbin (33 years old, no address), and Ding Shaotong (34 years old, resident of 2 Mingde Lane, Mofang Street) colluded to go to the home of Mrs. Chen Pushi, 51 Shangxian Lane, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, at around 7:00 PM the day before yesterday. They claimed to have a private collection of opium and said that they were ordered by the police to search. If they were given a reward of 500 yuan, they could avoid trouble, otherwise, they would be arrested, etc. Chen Pushi's younger brother, Peichunlin, saw through Yao's deception and knew that they were impersonating detectives and extorting money. So, he pretended to comply and sent someone out to call the French police. The detectives, Kang Hui, and others, rushed to the scene and arrested Yao and the other three. They were taken back to the police station and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday morning. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the French Concession Administrative Authority, stated the details of the case and requested an adjournment for investigation, then requested a trial. After Judge Liao questioned the defendants, their statements were ambiguous. The court ordered the defendants to be detained and the hearing rescheduled for the 19th.</p>
<h3>Brother Killed by Gunfire; Elder Brother Seeks Justice; Zhou Huaiqing Highly Suspected; Arrested After Reporting to the Police; Simultaneously Detained</h3>
<p>Wang Qirong, 22 years old, from Liuhe, had been selling cigarettes and miscellaneous goods from Shanghai to Liu since the war. On June 13 of this year, he was suddenly shot and killed at Zhao Wang Temple, two miles from Liuhe. Liu Dexiang and Xu Liuming were also killed at the same time. Wang's adopted brother, Guo Wenhua, went to collect the body after the incident but could not find out who killed his brother. Until recently, a person named Meng told Guo Wenhua that Zhou Huaiqing from Liuhe killed his brother. Guo strictly investigated Zhou's whereabouts, plotting to avenge his brother. Until 2:40 PM on the 4th, Guo passed Sichuan Road, Hankou Road, and suddenly encountered Zhou. So, he called Hua Detective Wu Yaozu and the 67th Hua policeman to arrest Zhou and take him to the General Patrol Room. After investigation, the detectives believed that although Guo firmly pointed out that Zhou was the murderer who killed his brother, he could not provide conclusive evidence. To avoid false accusations, Guo and Zhou were detained together and sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Jiang Baolian, the police lawyer, requested permission to temporarily detain both Guo and Zhou so that the detectives could investigate in detail. If they obtained conclusive evidence that Zhou had killed someone, they would request Guo's release, etc. After Judge Feng Shide questioned them, he ordered the hearing to be rescheduled for one week.</p>
<h3>Entrusted Friend Falsely Claims to Have Been Killed by Japanese Troops; Attempting to Embezzle Funds; Busted by Original Owner While Still Trying to Cover Up; Continued Delay in Returning Funds Leads to Detention</h3>
<p>Chen Xianhe, 57 years old, from Hangzhou, currently residing at 18 Pope Lane, Luban Road, French Concession, was previously the manager of the Hengda Xie Paint Shop in Hangzhou. He came to Shanghai to take refuge due to the war and is temporarily residing at the above location, still engaged in his old business. Wanting to develop his business, he wrote to his brother, Chen Shengqing, last month, asking him to send funds to Shanghai to purchase goods. On June 30, his brother Chen Shengqing entrusted his fellow villager and friend Meng Jinshui (45 years old) to</p>
<p>carry 1,400 yuan in cash to Shanghai to be handed over to Chen Xianhe. Unexpectedly, after Meng arrived in Shanghai, he had bad intentions and temporarily resided at the home of his friend Ge Ruhua, 30 Shangren Lane, McTaggart Road. He then asked Ge to call Chen Xianhe, falsely claiming that Meng had been killed by Japanese troops on the way and that the funds he was carrying had been robbed. At that time, Chen did not believe him because his words were contradictory. He immediately went to Ge Ruhua's place with his friend Zhu Ziliang to</p>
<p>inquire about the news and ran into Meng sleeping on Ge's bed. Seeing Chen and others, Meng's face turned pale, and he could not answer. Then he claimed that although he had not been killed by the Japanese troops, he had been severely beaten and was willing to compensate the full amount. At that time, he returned 600 yuan, and he also obtained 200 yuan from Meng's younger sister, Tao Mengshi, making a total of 800 yuan, still short 600 yuan. He promised to return it on time, but</p>
<p>continued to delay. Chen then reported to the French police, accusing Meng and his sister of embezzlement and requesting an investigation. The detectives arrested Meng Jinshui and Tao Mengshi, and yesterday they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. They were charged with embezzlement and possession of property belonging to others and requested a rescheduling of the hearing because the investigation had not been completed. After Judge Li questioned the defendants, he ordered the hearing to be rescheduled for the 9th. The defendants were detained.</p>
<h3>Armed Brawl on Zhoushan Road</h3>
<p>At around 10:04 AM yesterday, a fight broke out with weapons at 556 Zhoushan Road, Yangshupu. As a result, a total of six people suffered knife wounds. Chen A-yu, 39 years old, was wounded on the left thigh, Xu Shengsheng, 17 years old, was wounded on the back, Yuan Shigen, 20 years old, was wounded on the right leg, Cai A-xin, 17 years old, was wounded on the chest, Chen A-miao, 43 years old, was wounded on the head and back, and Shi Caifu, 20 years old, was wounded on the right hand.

<h3>Car Driver Leads Mob Violence, Two Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 5th) at 4:45 PM, an incident of fighting and injury occurred at the entrance of Yuanshang Lane on the south side of East Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, French Avenue. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The incident originated at No. 1 Yuanshang Lane, East Zilaihuo Street, a three-story Western-style building. The second landlord is an elderly woman surnamed [ ] (commonly known as Grandma). She rented the third floor to Zhang Xiaomao and his wife, a car driver working for Hu, the head of the French Municipal Council, who resided in the former lane of the Hu residence. The second floor was rented to He Jingqing and his family, an accountant at the Lao Zhenghe restaurant on Fuzhou Road in the Public Concession. The first floor was rented to someone surnamed Jia, who opened a clothing store. The second landlord lived on the mezzanine. Zhang Xiaomao wanted to take over the second floor. He Jingqing refused to move, and Zhang harbored resentment. At the end of last month, He fell ill and was bedridden. Zhang Xiaomao made loud noises when going up and down the stairs. He's wife politely asked Zhang to be quieter when using the stairs. Zhang claimed that He's wife was intentionally interfering with his movements, leading to arguments and mutual scolding. The two sides became incompatible. A few days ago, they fought each other at home and went to the McBain Police Station to report the injury. The case is still unresolved.</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 5th) at 4:45 PM, Zhang Xiaomao gathered more than ten fellow car drivers (including four or five women), each carrying wooden sticks and knives. They rushed into He Jingqing's room on the second floor of No. 1 Yuanshang Lane, destroying the belongings. At that time, He was talking with his colleagues Li Binghan and Xie Dejun (both waiters at Lao Zhenghe restaurant). Seeing Zhang leading a crowd to assault people and destroy property, they joined the fray. The two sides fought from inside the house to the middle of the road. As a result, Li Binghan was the most seriously injured. The corners of his forehead and temples were stabbed with a knife, blood flowing profusely, his head swollen and bruised, and his body covered with wounds. He collapsed at the entrance of the lane. Xie Dejun and He Jingqing were both beaten internally with sticks and fled into the Xinxin pawnshop opposite Renmei Lane, unable to move.</p>
<p>The main perpetrator is at large. At that time, nearby patrol officers heard the alarm and rushed to the scene. Zhang Xiaomao and his accomplices, seeing their purpose achieved, scattered and fled. When the police arrived, the perpetrators had already escaped. They only saw the injured lying on the sidewalk, barely breathing, with blood everywhere. They immediately called the police station and dispatched an ambulance to take the injured Li Binghan, Xie Dejun, and He Jingqing to the Renji Hospital for treatment. Detectives took the second landlord, the elderly woman [ ], to the police station for investigation. According to one account, the suspects have already been arrested.</p>
<h3>"Shanghai Livestock Market" Employee Stabbed</h3>
<p>Yu Guihe, a Ningbo native and employee of the "Shanghai Livestock Market" at No. 52 Yuezhou Road in Pudong, 19 years old, was involved in a verbal dispute with several pork butcher workers at around 3:30 PM yesterday. The dispute escalated into a physical altercation. Yu stepped forward to mediate but was stabbed in the left foot with a sharp knife by one of the workers. Blood flowed profusely. The perpetrator was arrested by the post police and taken to the police station. The injured person was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Lottery Ticker in Zhejiang Road</h3>
<p>Hired by lottery kingpins Mao Axiang and Li Xiaobao, a lottery ticker was set up at No. 48, Lane 229, Zhejiang Road, exclusively collecting gambling funds from various brothels in Yunnan Road, Guangxi Road, Shantou Road, and other locations. On average, it could collect 700-800 yuan in national currency per day. Previously, detective Chen Ruisheng from the police station discovered this and arrested the accomplices, A Bang and Jiang Zhaoying, at the address. 48 yuan in gambling money, 17 lottery tickets, one abacus, one ledger, and several pencils were confiscated. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special Court, where Judge Zhong questioned them and rendered a judgment. Gu A Bang and Jiang Zhaoying were sentenced to eleven months of imprisonment for intending to profit by inducing others to gamble. The gambling paraphernalia and money were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Fire in Avenue Joffre</h3>
<p>A firewood shop at No. 1, Lane 214 (Shunchang Lane), west of Limei Road on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, caught fire accidentally at 4:20 PM yesterday. The flames soared, bursting through the roof. The Central Fire Brigade received the news and rushed to the scene. However, because firewood and coal are highly flammable, the fire was not extinguished until around 6:00 PM. It also spread to neighboring houses. The French Route 21 and Route 22 buses had to temporarily change their routes to Avenue Haig due to the traffic disruption caused by the fire.</p>
<h3>Young Man Commits Suicide Due to Gambling</h3>
<p>Tang Shiqing, 26 years old, from Songjiang, lived in the Xujiahui Zhengtangjie area. He worked as a servant for a Western family on Avenue Haig. Recently, Tang frequented gambling dens, resulting in heavy debts that he could not repay. He conceived the idea of ending his life. The night before, he secretly bought and consumed opium. Until yesterday morning, he groaned from poisoning. His family rushed him to the hospital for treatment but it was too late. He died shortly after arriving at the hospital.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I read in your newspaper's local news column on the 4th of this month an article about the tenants of Haigeri opposing rent increases, which is not in accordance with the facts. The rent for the houses in Haigeri, Xujiahui owned by our church are extremely low. The land tax and repair costs have increased greatly, so we have made a minimum increase of four yuan for the tenants. The tenants of this church are very understanding and most have agreed to the increase. The claim of unanimous opposition and demand for retraction is not true. We are afraid that the rumors are false, so we specially request your newspaper to correct the record for public convenience. Sincerely, Haigeri Madun Hou Church Rental Office.</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>According to Mr. Wei Kuisheng, the party concerned, I read a news item in the newspaper on the 4th of this month entitled "Rampant Jianghu Swindlers", in which several points differ slightly from the facts. It was discovered that after being swindled on July 10, I reported the matter to the police on two occasions. The first decision was to report the facts, but the police dismissed it as unfounded. Later, because I was unable, I reported the theft to the police for the second time. The previous case had already been recorded. Furthermore, I have resigned from the store and not been dismissed, because I felt that my experience was not enough after this incident and I planned to give up business and go to school for further studies. Furthermore, the police reported the theft because the fraud was not accepted. Fortunately, the fraudsters have been arrested, and I can now express my inner feelings. This matter concerns my personal reputation, and I hereby entrust your lawyer to write to the newspapers to request a correction. I hereby urgently inform you that I hope that you will grant the correction. Sincerely, Lawyer Xu Wufang, August 5.</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having reviewed your newspaper news of the 5th of this month, there is a report of a Jiang, who apparently suffers from a chronic disease, and who wishes to act unfavorably toward a Shi, a teacher at Zhengzhong Middle School. He was subsequently escorted to the police station by the police. None of our new and old teaching staff are surnamed Shi, and we are deeply concerned that the outside world will spread false information. We hereby specially request you to correct this for the sake of propriety. Sincerely, Shanghai Private Zhengzhong Middle School, August 5.</p>

<h3>Don't Be Allowed to Eat Idle Rice</h3>
<p>— Fenfei</p>
<p>Children! I hope you don't eat "idle rice," and we shouldn't be allowed to "eat idle rice."</p>
<p>In today's severe national crisis, every one of our Chinese compatriots is absolutely not allowed to "eat idle rice." Life must be "productive." Look! The children of Jiangbei, during the scorching heat of summer, leave deep imprints of their lives on every street inside and outside the city. Especially near the garbage cans at the corners of the roads, there are always groups of Jiangbei children with baskets on their backs or in their hands, their eyes always searching inside, as if there are pearls and treasures there. But I don't find it strange, because there are many waste items in the garbage cans, which become useful after they take them away. Otherwise, wouldn't they become fools? Because of the pressure of life, everyone, old and young, has work to do. Like the old women! They run out to mend clothes and quilts for others. The adults carry sugar loads to sell sugar on the streets. The old men mostly live on boats doing odd jobs. The children, from three or four years old to seventeen or eighteen, come out to "pick scraps." So it can be said that no one is "eating idle rice," and they are not allowed to "eat idle rice."</p>
<p>The hardworking spirit of the people of Jiangbei is something we have seen countless times. It is worthy of our admiration. Whether in summer or winter, they mostly go barefoot. Especially in the hot summer, the younger children are completely naked, truly the founders and practitioners of the nude movement. When we look at their faces, we might think they are sick, but their skin is reddish-black and strong. Although they are in a situation that easily "causes illness," bacteria still don't invade, and their resistance is very strong. The yellowness of their faces is clearly due to insufficient nutrition, and the reddish-black is clearly the result of being scorched by the sun. They are not afraid of wind, frost, rain, or dew. I often see children (boys and girls) around four or five years old always walking barefoot on the ground. At the same time, the older children lead them to "pick scraps" everywhere. Before meals in the evening, we will see them carrying extremely heavy baskets, tied with ropes around their necks. But they don't seem to be in pain, on the contrary, they are very happy to return home (to the boat) to eat. The things they eat every day (vegetable scraps and roots thrown away in the garbage cans) or leftover food begged from others. They are not particular about the vegetables, but they eat their fill of rice. "Picking scraps" is the only job of Jiangbei children.</p>
<p>Everyone, you probably won't say I'm lying about the above facts! Ask yourselves how comfortable your lives are! How protected you are by your parents. If you have any illness, everyone is busy and hurrying to call the doctor. This is certainly fortunate. We should know that to have a healthy body, we must exercise. The children of Jiangbei are our proof. Now even the young ladies in their boudoirs are not weak and delicate! How could we boys be so pathetically fragile! Fortunately, the schools have long paid attention to sports! Perhaps weakness will not exist, so there is no need to worry! There is very little in terms of production! On the isolated island, we see poor children doing small businesses like selling ice and selling newspapers. At the same time, during the escape, I also saw many children selling cigarettes. This is mostly driven by "life" to walk on the road to "eat." We should not despise small businesses. Look! Edison, Mussolini... great men of this kind have all done this small business. So we are not afraid of "low origins," as long as we "work hard"! I finally hope that you can find work to do during the summer vacation, so that you don't "eat idle rice."</p>
<h3>Everyone Must Get Up Early</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Due to various environmental reasons, we all live in the city, and we don't get any fresh air every day. We can't get a quiet time every day. We eat coal ash, swallow the smelly "Casilan," and listen to the noisy and clamorous sounds... This is already a great misfortune. How can the city compare to the countryside? There are many trees, the air is good, there are few residents, and the environment is quiet. These two things are extremely beneficial to people.</p>
<p>What are the benefits? First, the air is good, which can make the body strong, the mind clear, and the energy sufficient, and everything is done happily. Second, the environment is quiet, which can make reading focused, concentration focused, and thinking clear. However, in a bustling city, there is no such enjoyment, except for going to the park. It's just that sometimes it's limited by time and economics, so there's no chance to go to the park often. Children: When you want to read some books, maybe the domino sound from the neighbor's house will come to disturb you. When you want to write, maybe the motor in the nearby workshop will vibrate your wrist. Especially in this hot season, you may extremely hate all kinds of disturbances that hinder your self-study, and think that there is no choice.</p>
<p>Here, I have an opinion: In summer, I hope children can get up especially early. Develop the habit of getting up early. Taking advantage of the hot weather, I think getting up early will not be difficult. After the habit of getting up early is formed, the lazy disease of getting up late will be defeated. The city during the day and night is indeed filled with coal gas and smog, but it is much better before six or seven o'clock in the morning. The high chimneys of the factories have not yet smoked, and the smoke from the kitchens of every household has not yet risen. There is no noise of pedestrians and vehicles outside. There is also no domino sound and lively human voices in the house. In this way, pushing open the window, the air is relatively fresh, and sitting in front of the window to read is the best thing to do. If you are afraid of waking others up, the sound of reading should be lowered. Moreover, the adults will not blame you even if you are awakened because they see that you are willing to study hard. In addition, writing, calculating problems, making sentences, composing essays, drawing... everything is extremely suitable, easy to understand, and easy to penetrate into the brain.</p>
<p>In the morning, the effectiveness of any work is more advanced than at other times. The ancients had a saying: "Getting up early for three days is like one day's work," which is to tell people that in the clear morning air and quiet people, concentrating on everything will often achieve twice the result with half the effort. Children: If you want to study hard, then everyone must get up early. It is better to go to bed early than to get up late. If you can do this, you don't necessarily have to envy the countryside.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Tunxi</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>The Twenty-Eighth Record of Ming'er's Escape</p>
<p>The Jiangshan boat floated across the beautiful Fuchun River and wandered through the simple Xin'an River. Ming'er's group of refugees spent more than ten days of long life on the boat. Green mountains and clear waters, thatched houses and fields, big cities and small towns, they almost all heard and saw them. This has increased Ming'er's knowledge of life a lot, but the price they paid is also considerable.</p>
<p>At noon on the twelfth day of the boat's departure from Hangzhou, Ming'er scooped a bowl of rice and ate it with relish on the bow of the boat.</p>
<p>"We can arrive in Tunxi this evening." As soon as Ming'er heard the word Tunxi, he was very happy in his heart, because Ming'er was a bit tired of living on the boat, so he had asked the boatman several times how many days it would take to reach his destination, but he was always uncertain because they relied on the weather to eat, and the speed of smooth winds and smooth water and headwinds and headwinds differed greatly, and the changes in the weather were difficult to measure. But today, he said to Ming'er with great certainty.</p>
<p>"Can we arrive today? It's been more than ten days, which is considered slow." Ming'er said with a happy and slightly complaining tone.</p>
<p>"It's only been twelve days today, which is already fast. Once, we traveled from Hangzhou to Tunxi for a full twenty days, because the water was shallow and we were fighting headwinds every day, which was really hard work."</p>
<p>Ming'er saw a strip of houses lined up at the end of the vast river. At this time, on both sides of the river bank, you could often see fortresses standing like stone houses with square holes dotted on the stone walls covered with grass, indicating that they had weathered the wind and rain, showing an heroic spirit. Later, Ming'er learned that it was used by the local villagers during the Taiping Rebellion to resist foreign bandits.</p>
<p>"That's Tunxi over there." "Is Tunxi lively?" Ming'er's words had a purpose, because he had passed through many towns and cities since he boarded the ship in Hangzhou, but the towns and cities he landed on always disappointed him, because they were very deserted, with uneven stone roads, low and poor houses, and few shops, and few customers patronizing them. Commerce was of course pitifully deserted. Compared with Ming'er's hometown's bustling city, there was a world of difference. He had also spent such a long and boring life on the boat, and his spirit was inevitably very depressed, so he urgently needed to adjust it. Now that he heard that "Tunxi is coming soon," he hurriedly raised this question.</p>
<p>"Tunxi is really lively, and everything is available. The streets are wide, the shops are many, rickshaws, bicycles, and cars come and go on the streets, and there are other things to play with. Except for Hangzhou, Tunxi is not considered not lively, so many people call it 'Little Shanghai,' which is really not wrong at all." The boatman said while recalling all his impressions after arriving in Tunxi before.</p>
<p>Ming'er was delighted to hear the boatman boast about how lively and fun Tunxi was, and his heart burst into a smile. He hoped to arrive in Tunxi sooner so he could have a good time.</p>
<p>But although they saw it, he asked the boatman and there were still more than ten miles to go. The more anxious he was, the slower the boat traveled. The river surface also gradually narrowed a lot, and was more winding than before. The boat was really like a worm crawling winding on a smooth snake's body. The sun was also constantly moving westward. Ming'er stood still on the bow of the boat, widening his eyes and looking. The houses were much closer, and the towering masts beside that big tree were like bamboo shoots after the rain, standing tall on the horizon, and a hungry eagle flapping its wings and circling, looking for its target.</p>
<p>They did not arrive in Tunxi until it was dark.</p>
<h3>Little Carpenter in the Summer Vacation, Little Dancer</h3>
<p>— Xinsheng</p>
<p>Children, I think you can have time to make this small woodworking project during the long summer vacation besides reviewing the old textbooks and preparing the new books for the second half of the year; one is that the production is simple and you can practice your handicraft skills, and the other is that after it is made, it can be used for various games.</p>
<p>The tools, materials, and production methods required for its production are as follows:</p>
<p>Tools: Small knife or small saw</p>
<p>Materials: Plywood (3.5 inches long and 2.5 inches wide), a small piece of three pieces, paint (various colors), glue, small nails,</p>
<p>Production method: First, according to the first picture, draw the face, body, limbs, and other parts of the little dancer on the plywood, and then use a small knife or small saw to cut it down to become a human shape. Then, use colored paint to paint the hair and facial features on the head. The color of the clothes can be painted into various patterns, or cut from patterned cloth and glued to the wood chip; if you are tired of the trouble of painting with oil paint, or there is no colored paint, you can change to a piece of drawing paper, draw the human shape on it, apply color, and then glue it on the wooden board, and then cut it. After the human shape is made, another long piece of wood is used to cut a round handle with a small knife (as shown in Figure 2) and glue it to the front and back of (1) (as shown in Figure 3). If you are tired of the trouble of cutting, you can use a long narrow strip of wood and nail it on with small nails to replace it, but when holding it, it is not as comfortable between the fingers as a round handle. In addition, take two small pieces of wood (each 1 inch long, 0.5 inches high, and 0.75 inches wide), and cut them into small wooden shoes according to Figure 4 with a small knife. The size of the shoe opening must be dug out according to the size of each person's index finger and middle finger so that they can be put on the fingers. Apply paint to the wooden shoes or apply them with colored ink. If so, the entire work is completed.</p>
<p>As for the playing method: Hold the handle on the back of the human figure with the middle finger and index finger of the right hand or left hand, and put a pair of wooden shoes on the fingertips respectively, so that you can do various jumping games. If sisters and children play together, it is even more fun!</p>
<h3>From the Animal Realm (12)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>An old female cat angrily shouted, "Enough with the nonsense! That scoundrel Peng Qi is extremely cruel and has committed all sorts of inhumane atrocities. Now there's nothing else to say, only to repay him in kind, one by one. Humph, he's a child, I say, he's a proper, bona fide child!"</p>
<p>One, 　, 　! The old male frog croaked again. It seemed to be considering the case as well.</p>
<p>The lion said very gently to the crowd, "Fellow creatures, we don't need to listen to any more testimonies against the criminal. His atrocities have already been proven by the facts. Even if he tries to blame Mr. Le Fu for the abuse of our cat brothers, it won't work. What we need to decide now is how to punish him. But since you have entrusted the power of judgment to me, then I must ask you to wait calmly and quietly, while I walk around three circles to carefully consider this matter."</p>
<p>But the lion walked around three circles and still couldn't decide. So, it increased its pace and walked around seven circles in a row, constantly wagging its tail. Finally, it returned to its original seat and sat down heavily. The old male frog raised its green head, waiting for the lion's judgment.</p>
<p>The lion said solemnly, "Fellow beasts, birds, and fish, I have given this case careful consideration, and I believe my decision will not cause any opposition from you. Our friend, Mrs. Female Cat, has said that the methods this criminal used to abuse cats in the past should be repaid to him in kind."</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on Yunnan Opera (Kunming Correspondence)</h3>
<p>— Liao Zhi</p>
<p>The structure, singing, dialogue, and musical accompaniment of Yunnan opera are quite similar to Beijing opera. Moreover, many of the plays performed are also those found in Beijing opera. For example, "San Niang Teaches Her Son," "A Mother Executes Her Son," "The Pearl Curtain Case," and "The Battle of Jieting" are all consistent with the plots and texts of Beijing opera. The melodies of the songs are also similar to those of the Han tune and Cantonese opera in Beijing opera, making them quite melodious and pleasing to the ear. The acting and expressions are also serious and meticulous. Among the various operas in our country, it should occupy a superior position. It is a pity that it has always been performed only in Yunnan Province, and no one has ever formed a troupe to perform in Hong Kong, Macau, or other places. Therefore, those who want to watch Yunnan opera must go to Yunnan Province in person. This is why Yunnan opera is not well known to people across the country.</p>
<p>Yunnan opera also has the distinction between Xipi and Erhuang. The rhythm and beat are also similar to those of Beijing opera. However, the embellishments of the words and the spoken dialogue are purely in the Yunnan dialect and tone, which is a characteristic of its local flavor.</p>
<p>Tan Xinpei of Yunnan</p>
<p>The current leading figure in Yunnan opera is Su Cheng, who is highly regarded. He is over sixty years old and does not often perform on stage. One evening, at the special request of various circles, he performed the play "A Mother Executes Her Son" on the New Yunnan Stage. Those who attended went to see it. Although there was not much singing or dialogue in this play, Su's exquisite and mature artistry could be seen at a glance. His appearance was extremely delicate, much like Tan's later years. His acting was also very meticulous, quite different from ordinary actors. It is believable that his reputation is well deserved and not accidental. There is also an old actor named Zhu Bayin, who sings Qingyi roles. His position is equivalent to that of the late Chen Delin (Shitou) in the Beijing opera world. He also does not often perform these days. He was scheduled to perform on the New Yunnan Stage last month, but unfortunately, I was unable to hear it due to 　　.</p>
<p>Many teahouses in Kunming have Yunnan opera performances, with Taihua Chun on Jinbi Road being the most famous. Among the performers, 　 Chu is particularly well-known.</p>
<p>Female Actor Xiao Lanchun</p>
<p>Xiao Lanchun sings the role of Laosheng (old male), and is bold, forthright, handsome and unrestrained, and has the air of a heroine. I have heard her perform "The Pearl Cave Fortress," playing Chen Jingsi (the Yunnan opera version of "The Pearl Cave Fortress" features Chen Jingsi as the main character, while Li Keyong is played by a painted-face actor in a supporting role), and "Slaying Zongbao" (i.e., the Beijing opera "Slaying the Son at the辕门"), both of which had extremely pleasing singing. She is fair-skinned and has a graceful bearing. Her attire is also quite fashionable, unlike the women of the general Yunnan region. Before hearing her speak, one would not know that she is from Yunnan.</p>
<p>The other night, I went with friends to Taihua to listen to "Yutang Chun" and the plays of Zhuo Fang and Cao. The lyrics and melodies are almost identical to those of Beijing opera. My friend also suspected that Yunnan opera must have been taught by actors from the old capital, so everything is largely the same. There have been several large-scale migrations in Yunnan's history, such as when Wu Sangui entered Yunnan at the beginning of the Qing Dynasty. Many of his followers were people from Yan (present-day Beijing), among whom there must have been people belonging to the pear garden profession.</p>
<p>The Origin of Yunnan Opera</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the reason, but unfortunately, I have not had time to study it in depth. The Yunnan financier, Mr. Miao 　tai, is an avid fan of Beijing opera, and is especially knowledgeable about Yunnan opera. He can also sing, but he is reluctant to show it easily. One day, several celebrities gathered at a banquet, and Miao was also present. Everyone asked Miao to sing, but Miao declined repeatedly. Everyone insisted, and Miao said that he would try his best after drinking to his heart's content. However, he never sang after drinking.</p>
<p>The instrumental accompaniment of Yunnan opera (i.e., the musical ensemble) is even more similar to that of Beijing opera. However, each 　 carries a [tanggu drum] to keep the rhythm, which is one point that is completely different from Beijing opera.</p>
<h3>"Defend Our Homeland" Premieres in Chongqing, Starring Ying Yin: A Record of Bloodied Treatment</h3>
<p>— Hui Cun</p>
<p>Serious Performance During Filming, Knife Wound to Blood Vessel</p>
<p>Large Number of Viewers Send Letters of Condolence</p>
<p>Ying Yin can be said to be one of the most outstanding female actors in China today. We will not forget her excellent performance as Wu Zetian in the amateur troupe's performance of "Wu Zetian" in previous years, which left a deep impression on general theatergoers.</p>
<p>She is twenty-two years old this year. She studied in Peiping (present-day Beijing) when she was young, so she has spoken fluent Mandarin since she was a child. Later, she studied at a certain girls' school in Nanchang. It is said that her father is Manchurian, while her mother is Cantonese. Before the war, she was a basic actor in an amateur troupe, and she also appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, she followed the amateur troupe to the inland to engage in theatrical work. When she was in Hankou, she became ill due to the hardship of the work. She returned to Shanghai via Peiping. However, after she recovered, she transferred to Hong Kong and then to the inland, and finally from Han to Chongqing. At that time, the amateur troupe had disbanded, and she joined [China Electric] as an actor through the introduction of someone named Pan. Later, she left [China Electric] and joined [China Manufacturing]. From time to time, she also participated in the drama performances of Chongqing film and theater people. Her first stage appearance in Chongqing was in "The True Story of Ah Q." After that, she performed in plays such as "General Mobilization," "National Glory," "Long Live the Nation," and "One Week." Her acting skills were quite skilled and profound, and were unanimously praised by the audience.</p>
<p>The first film she starred in after joining "China Manufacturing" was "Defend Our Homeland," a film directed by He Feiguang about rural education and national salvation. During the filming of this film, there was a scene in which Ying Yin and a Japanese military officer were fighting over a knife. It was probably too intense. The actor playing the Japanese military officer 　 moved the knife and accidentally cut her blood vessel. Thus, what was supposed to be a staged act turned into a real injury, and Ying Yin stayed in the hospital for a period of time.</p>
<p>When this film "Defend Our Homeland" was completed, it was screened last month at Chongqing's only remaining "Weiying Cinema," while the film's protagonist, Ying Yin, was still recovering in the hospital. When the general audience learned of this news, they all wrote letters of condolence to her because her realistic performance on the screen deeply moved the general audience. Therefore, she received a lot of letters of condolence every day in the hospital. In addition, some people sent them to the newspaper office to be published on their behalf.</p>
<p>Although letters of condolence are very popular at the moment, she is probably the first female actor and film actor to receive a large number of letters of condolence!</p>
<h3>Idle Talk About the Entertainment World</h3>
<p>— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Xiuyan</p>
<p>(12) Cantonese Opera</p>
<p>Because of the barrier of dialect, this purely southern-style Cantonese opera cannot be as popular as other [local operas]. In terms of lyrics, although there are many obscure and difficult-to-understand words, generally speaking, it is worthy of the comment [elegant and refined]. Several opera lyrics can almost represent a wide range of [literature].</p>
<p>It is a pity that the melody and tone always have a bit of a [stiff] feeling!</p>
<h3>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Differences in Inviting Performers, Past and Present</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the place where this single person sits is always at the stage entrance facing the exit. In the old-fashioned teahouses (theaters, mostly called teahouses), there were tables for eight immortals arranged in front of the stage. Perhaps five tables could be arranged in a row, and at most five or six rows could be arranged. These were all called pool seats. Behind the pool seats and on the left and right sides, there might be several long benches. If the floor space was small, the pool seats would be surrounded by railings, and everything outside the railings would be sold as standing room. There were also a few called crane seats. Generally, those who sat in the pool seats were local gentry, wealthy households, big business owners, or people in officialdom. They sat upright at the table, and those who faced the stage were more respected than those who sat on both sides of the table and leaned against the table with their backs. Therefore, whenever a performer invited to perform and his companions entered the teahouse, they would deliberately dress up as wealthy merchants, sit in the center of the table, and one or two of their attendants would sit on either side. In the old-fashioned theaters, the pool seats could accommodate a maximum of three or four people. Therefore, when a performer on stage made a sound of praise for someone in a certain seat, the people on stage could recognize it very clearly. The performer inviting the performance would naturally always applaud the performer he was targeting to get his attention. He would originally sit at the stage entrance of the exit (anyone who knows how to listen to opera will choose to sit at the stage entrance of the exit). If the performer happened to be singing the next sentence and entering the backstage, he would always turn around and stand at the stage entrance, sing the scattered beat of the next sentence, and then enter the stage. At this time, the person on stage and the person inviting the performance were only a foot away from each other, and all actions and words could be conveyed from the stage to the performer.</p>
<p>Everyone has a [climbing this mountain and looking at that mountain is higher] mentality. A famous performer who has stayed in the original place for a long time will inevitably want to change places and play around. Moreover, if his seats sell well, he feels that this is a great achievement. Not only does he want to increase the monthly payment to the theater owner, but his temperament and temper will also become much larger.</p>
