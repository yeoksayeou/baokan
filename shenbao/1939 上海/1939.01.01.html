<h3 id="c15">元旦獻辭 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>茲値中華民國二十八年元旦，在公歷爲一九三九年之歲首。夫今日所不同於昨日，曾無殊於明日之不同於今日：原大地廻旋，有晝有夜，有寒有暑，而宇宙蒼茫，無起無迄，無始無終；若乃制爲歲月，翹然以此日爲元旦者，亘古人事，創爲紀律一端，歷千百載而不廢，蓋自有其不勝述之運用。頹唐者傷感於歲月如逝，憬然於老之漸至；有爲者，布新除舊，行健自强，萬象生機，輒隨新歲而萌動焉。</p>
<p>丁此良辰，我人所欲禱祝者無盡數，所　勗勉者無止境；舉其大端：一九三七八年間世界第二决大戰之預言，以事實證明其幸而未騐；然去年一年之中，中日兩國，承前年之後，自衛與侵略之戰綫，綿延可三千五百公里：西班牙之爲國際戰爭之試騐塲者，爲國境三之二；捷克斯拉夫所付避免戰爭之代價，爲領土三之一；阿比西尼亞卒爲歐洲茍安之犧牲，乃由國際契的簽證其滅亡；此外懸而未决者，如九國公的已至存廢關頭，歐陸有烏克蘭爲火藥新庫，菲洲有法屬爲義大利所覬覦，蘇日漁的至昨日期滿而無以爲繼；凡此者，皆去年年底之國際重要「宕賬」也。是以大戰之未如預言而實現者，乃爲危機之延擴與演變，絕非根本消弭。危機旣不與歲月俱逝，則綏靖之道，應如何與時日俱進？不能綏靖，則元旦即可想像此年之將不能優遊卒歲，是欲諱言而不可得者也。</p>
<p>如何綏靖？當世政家，或以與現實妥協爲綏靖秘訣。然戰神之不饜於捷阿，去年年底之現實未能較善於去年年初之現實，旣對妥協作坦白之答復；而本年各國所定國家算預中之軍費一項，殆無不超過曠古之紀錄，是足反證綏靖固未趨嚮成功。英相張伯倫氏於辭歲之辭，表示决不向武力屈服；皤然老翁而毅然言此，妥協後之國際依然嚴重，允可知矣。不妥協則如何。當世論者，輒言惟有民治國家相團結。此以國際之分野論之，掀風作浪，窮兵黷武者，沆瀣一氣，皆非民治國家也；爲保持和平而與之抗衡，自非民治國家團結不爲功。鑒此分野，我人非惟贊同其說，且應造成强有力之世界輿論，以促團結之成功。雖然，自更準確之意義言之，國政之民治與吾，獨裁與吾，法西主義與吾，共產主義與吾，各行其所宗信可也，何與於國際？雖獨裁政體者，與法西生義者，在其本質上，包容强烈之黷武因素，綜合觀之，似乎與侵略行爲必不可分：然我人所應反對者，究爲反對侵略而不必問其爲獨裁與法西。由是以言：團結反抗侵略，何爲而必以民治爲號召！與其以民治爲號召，而相形獨裁之非，意識上幾爲政治理論之柄鑿，是非之辨，將無定論；髯各更作進一層之體認，而確定當世之爭端，蓋維持國際原來良好之秩序者爲一面，而倡爲新秩序之說以破壞秩序者爲又一面；歐洲然，菲洲然，亞洲允然。</p>
<p>試檢討去年經過，歐洲菲洲皆經妥協而略變原狀矣，於事何補？亞洲爲所謂新秩序而戰爭經年矣，不復原狀，如何息爭？若循去年之現象而放任之，彼侵略者必作進一步之勾結，以軍事相盟，作進一步破壞秩序之行動；則無論歲首如何禱祝和平福利，將無一而不歸於幻滅。和平福利必建於秩序，家庭然，家鄉僻壤然，國際允然。是以本年國際應相勗勉者無他，日爲和平福利而珍惜秩序而已，爲尊重秩序而制止破壞秩序而已。</p>

<p>客謂予曰：工商座談之名稱，染有「和」氣，且無「座」何「談」，故於時為不合，於義為不愜，子何取焉！</p>
<p>予曰，有是哉！予特當時信筆所至耳！夫在今日而言「和」，是誠何心哉！固「座談」之為稱，饒有「和」氣，予將舍之之不邊，豈肯以「和」氣　凟我可尊貴之「工商」。如工商而果染有「和」氣，則亦工商之自誤，並誤其子孫巳！予信工商界多賢智，善護其財產，决無苟且附「和」之理。</p>
<p>文化原無國界，貴互通，但在被侵略之時代，而讀用其文字，則與平時之讀為求智機者大異；適見其欲為亡國奴耳！因之無論一名物之微，凡可邀免者宜避免之。然則將何所取名乎？名之曰談座可乎？一而二，二而一，猶是換湯不換藥，謂之不染「和」氣得乎！</p>
<p>名之曰工商談助，庶幾近之，且其文義亦完全為國產，蓋談助二字之源，出於蔡邕之得王充論衡，秘玩以為談助。而王充論衡之作，前人評之，為「論辨新穎，務求盡意，不惜繁詞，大抵訂譌砭俗，中理者多，亦殊有裨於屬敎一。即本報工商座談之闢置，原期有助於工商，敷陳意見，討論得失，非評非論，謂之談助，以視蔡邕竊取他人文字為談助者，固屬有間；而與論衡之訂譌砭俗，務求盡意，不惜繁詞之用意正同。</p>
<p>中華民國二十八年，中華民族抗戰勝利之年也。客旣謂「座談」之染有「和」氣也，故乘履端伊始，更名本欄曰工商談助，為工商界業務餘聞，相與縱談論商之地位也可。</p>

<p>親愛的同胞們：</p>
<p>今天是中華民國成立紀念日。在抗戰第二期中我們逢此佳節，雖說無心歡樂，但亦並不悲哀；相反的因為抗戰形勢的好轉，國際行動的積極，却使我們有無限的興奮，同時，更感覺到今後責任的重大。</p>
<p>孤島的同胞，在無情的風雨，昏暗的魔影，從四周襲來的環境中，都能够緊緊把握住自己的靈魂。嚴拒惡鬼的誘惑，巨魔的吞噬，並且對於節的獻金，救濟難民，和徵募寒衣等工作，更盡了不少的力量，這種艱苦奮鬥的精神，確是値得稱頌的，但是我們不要祗注意到這光明的一面，應該再看看黑暗的一角，馬路上熙攘往來，消費塲所的金迷紙醉，舞塲酒樓的人滿為息，在在暴露出還有不少頹唐的墮落的份子，在消耗大量的外滙，在浪費大量的國力。言念及此，彌深痛惜！然而這正吿訴我們，孤島同胞過去的努力，還嫌不够！</p>
<p>諺云：「一年之計在於春。」在這「一元復始，大地回春」的時候，用將我們今後應該努力的工作，列舉於後，以作各界同胞行進的目標。</p>
<p>第一：商界同胞，自從國軍西撤後，始終沒有忘記了自己的責任，在萬般艱難的環境中，依舊咬緊牙關，奮鬥不懈，拒絕敵偽接收市商會，忠貞節烈，感人至深。但我們不能吾認，事實上有不少目光如豆的工商業者，一時昧於微利，在利用現有局勢替敵人銷售敵貨，或興辦消費娛樂等事業，這種行為，不必苛責他們是有意識的在犯着資敵的罪惡，卽專從利益方面着想，也屬十分脆薄，何况敵偽環伺在側，任意剝削，任意攫奪，將是無法逃避的刦運！耍曉得道一决抗戰，是為了要完成建國的永久基礎，抗戰的根據，是在廣大的內地，允其是西南與西北，在那裏的交通建設，政府巳逐步完成，正期待着我全國的工商界的投資，去開發那無窮盡的富藏。所以今後工商界同胞，應該糾正過去的錯覺，負起抗戰建國的任務，將一切資源儘可能的移轉到內地去，展開我們的開發工作。也惟有這樣，你們的資金，纔得安全處置，你們的收穫纔得確實可靠。</p>
<p>第二：過去一年，工界同胞，同樣的也沒有放棄過救國的責任。他們緊守着原來的崗位，注視着敵偽的進襲，生活雖苦，但仍在勞資協調的狀態下，同舟共濟，切實合作，這種苦鬥的精神，殊足嘉尙。不過，我們曉得，還有許多熟練的，技術的工人，因為找不到工作，躅躑在街頭，度着那遊蕩的生活。我們相信這批可愛的工友，意志是很堅定，絕不會受那奸人的誘惑，給敵偽去驅使，然而時日過久，他們難免要經不起飢寒的脅迫，勢將招致不可想像的結果，何况任他們在遊散，究是一種國力的損失。現在我們的西南和西北，從事經濟建設的時候，正需要大量熟練的技術的工友去工作，我們很希望一般工友要認淸環境，別再留戀這生計巳絕的孤島，自覺的投到內地去，那邊可使你得到安定的生活，是决不會使你們失望的。</p>
<p>第三：上海敎育界同胞，一年來恪守三民主義敎育宗旨，擘書經營，努力不輟，終使敵偽奴化政策歸於幻滅，其功績實不亞於前綫殺敵的將士，允足為一般社會之表率。不過，事實上也不免有一二敗類，對於國家所頒的敎育原則，視若弁髦，或任意增刪學校科自，更易部定課程標準，或採用陳舊敎材，禁止談論時事，他們所持的理由，無非為避免摩擦。這種觀念，如果不是別具用心，便是忘却了敎育對於國家社會的積極作用。我們希望今後敎育界一方面要遵守部章，恪依功令，從事啟迪訓導的工作，執行抗戰難關的任務，同時，一方面要精誠合作，共同排斥那般投機牟利的敗類，以維正氣，而毌負國家的敎育本旨。</p>
<p>第四，靑年是革命的先鋒隊，是國家的新生命，社會政治的建設，都要靠着靑年主力的策動。上海的靑年在過去已提供了不可磨滅的勳績，和盡了最大的努力，參與了抗戰建國工作。然而國軍西撤後，多數靑年雖則依舊孜孜矻矻，自强不息，但也有少數因為環境的特殊，空氣的窒息而感到苦悶，由苦悶而竟入歧途，沉緬在娛樂塲所，過着浪漫頹唐的生活。也許他們有說不出的苦痛，但至少是犯了對現實認識不淸的錯誤。要曉得在這個環境裏，固然不許你們做更多的抗敵工作，然而正因為如此，你們纔安心埋頭於學術的研究，充實自己的學識技能，為國家造成一個三民主義的戰士，來担負將來更艱鉅更繁重的任務。我們希望今後靑年同胞，應該發奮自勵，嚴密本身的組織，整飭自己的精神，注意科學的修養，和技術的訓練，切莫自暴自棄，變成國家民族的一個蠹蟲。</p>
<p>第五：抗戰是我們建國的手段，建國是我們抗戰的目的，我們一方抗戰，一方建國，因此建國的工作，也隨着抗戰的進展和順利而更現其急迫和需要，現在我們的後方，對於一般專門人材，如醫師，藥劑師，工程師，建築師，機械學家，化學家等等，倍感缺乏，然而孤島上却有許多專門人材閑散着，他們何嘗不想獻身國家？有的因為有家室之累，不能遠征：有的因為不堪長途跋涉，趦趄不前：有的因為過慣都市生活，不敢投入內地。其實，一般技術專家：你們的精神，如果要有美滿愉快的寄託，你們的才能，如果要有充分發揮的機會，應該放棄這已經快僵斃的孤島，投奔內地去，創造你們光明燦爛的前程，樹立你們千古不朽的功勳！</p>
<p>第六：上海因為含有國際性的關係，似乎還保持相當的安全，於是各地淪陷區的同胞，都以此為避難所，不絕地擁來，形成今日孤島人口的膨脹和畸形的繁榮，一般消費生活的奢侈享樂，直令人不相信這是在戰時掙扎中的中國人民的生活。這種現象，實屬可怕！我們認為在此抗戰轉入第二期的緊要關頭，凡屬同胞，倘使不能到內地去積極參加抗戰，至少應該節衣縮食，為自己延長生活力：進德修業，為國家培養新血液。要曉得將來建國工作的艱苦繁重，更十倍於今日，不特需要龐大的人力，抑且需要雄厚的物力。務望一般市民認淸自己責任的重大，深自惕勵，戒絕一切不良的嗜好，摒除一切娛樂糜費，為國家儲備新的力量。</p>
<p>第七：至於一般工作，如節的運動的推行，抵貨運動的開展，更需要各界同胞，繼續努力，廣大動員，務期各該運動的普遍和深人，以求澈底的成功。現在倡行的「一元還債運動」，各團體止在詳擬具體辦法，即將開始，各界同胞允應踴躍輸將，努力推行，表示我孤島同胞不孤的精神，增進友邦對我援助的信念，但是還債的獻金，應取之以節的的所得，因為以法幣獻與國家，不過是一種籌碼的轉移，國庫方面固然多了一筆收入，可以用作償還外債，但國富却未見增高，國力亦談不到增厚。唯有以節的所得，作還債資金，纔能减輕國家負担，增厚國家的力量。希望在推行「一元還債運動」的時候和「節的運動」配合起來，那麼纔能收穫實際的效果。</p>
<p>總之：我們現在應該努力的工作，固不僅上列幾端，將來新的趨勢，更需要有新的努力，但這却是目前比較切實比較緊要的工作，同時我們認為：暴敵因為泥足的愈陷愈深，國際形勢的愈形惡劣，對我們的壓迫將益發兇殘，允其是對上海，他們將更展開惡毒的魔爪，來攫奪來蹂躪，但是我們並不「畏懼，」這將是他們的「迥光返照，」我們的勝利，已隨着暖和的春天降臨。我們要以「更哀戚更堅忍，更踏實更刻苦，更猛勇奮進」的心理和精神，來粉碎暴敵侵略的迷夢，來完成我們抗戰建國的使命！敬祝努力！</p>

<p>改名復工</p>
<p>查瑞镩鐵廠、全爲英商資本所開設、與虹口之耶松鐵廠·浦東之和豐鐵廠·祥生鐵廠·董家渡</p>
<p>鐵廠。同屬一家，資力雄厚、營業亦頗發達、去歲八一三滬戰爆發、耶松·和豐·祥生·董家渡四廠、同時被迫停工、獨瑞鎔一廠、於戰時仍勉强維持一小部份工作、迨戰事西移後、耶松廠讓渡與英商馬勒公司、改為馬勒船廠、祥生董家渡兩廠、因環境關係、尙未復工、其瑞鎔和豐兩廠、一律改組內部、更稱英聯鐵廠、先後復工、</p>
<p>營業發達</p>
<p>按上海中外商開設之鐵廠、（或稱造船所）、大小共有數十家之多、戰後大部爲環境所迫、無法復業、故瑞鎔廠之復工、純為利用時機、造成衆枯獨榮、畸形發達之狀態、各公司大小輪船、如有損壞、羣趨該廠修理、所有工人、自數百人增至三千餘人、分包工與點工兩種性質、其中三份之一、住於楊樹浦戰區、三份之二住於蘇州河以南之兩租界內、目下廠內正在修理者、計有馬勒公司大輪一艘、小輪兩艘亞細亞公司福光輪一艘、怡和公司同和輪一艘、貴生輪一艘、英拖輪一艘、英國軍艦一艘、美國兵艦一艘、工作異常忙碌、</p>

<p>昨日上午、廠方宣佈年賞辦法、該廠之小輸船員部份、即於午後一時、全體表示不服，提出要求、除恢復戰前年賞兩星期達、須加賞兩星期、與華籍職員同樣待遇、詎廠方僅允在六天之年賞上、加賞一天、合賞一星期工資、船員等以不特未得加賞優待、且與戰前相較、反被尅扣一半、全體大譁、一刹那間、全體宣吿怠工、廠方恐其擾亂秩序、迫彼等一律返家、按該廠共有小輪甘仙號。會寗發地號·搿利地司號·瑾號。曼號。瑞鎔號·楊樹浦號·川大號，耶松號·及電焊輪等十一艘、挖泥輪一艘、起勇輪三艘、舢舨兩艘、共十七艘、全體船員、包括老大老軌水手生火飯司等、共達一百餘人、均於昨日午後二時離廠、</p>
<p>勢將擴大</p>
<p>該船員等全體怠工後、廠方所持態度、頗爲強硬、當因水道出入受阻、廠內工人、住在租界上（蘇州河河南）者二十餘人、放工後無法離廠、臨時雇用馬勒拖輪一艘、會德豐拖輪三艘、拖帶駁船、載運工人出廠、今明後三日新年放假、故引起何種發展、尙難明瞭、惟該廠點工部份、計有翻砂·銅匠·鉗床。車床·馬達·樣子·木匠·電燈。電桿·等工人一千四五百人、因戰前年賞一星期工資、亦被取消·故均有反對之意、一月四日開工後、傳亦有要求恢復年賞之議、故勞資糾紛、將有擴大之趨勢云、</p>

<p>— 賡</p>
<p>依照一般習俗，在歲尾年頭的時候，少不得要有一番「送舊迎新」的舉動。不過這一種「送舊迎新」的舉動，和妓女們的官塲中的「送舊迎新」的形態，含義却不相同。妓女在「鴇兒」的導演下，送却舊郞伴新郎，其目的在「鈔」：下屬對「上司」的升遷異動，打躬作揖，為的是「飯碗」。至於一般人在年節時的「送舊迎新」，却是一種進步的含有積極意義的現象。譬如商人們的將一年度的營業作一終結，次算店中的盈虧，以定來年的營業方針，或緊縮，或擴張；緊縮到極度，擴張到頂點，都要根據營業的次算；這一方結淸舊賬目，一方次定新方針，便是說明這種現象的進步性和積極性。因此，一般人對於新年有着不同的觀念，有的在歡欣，有的在苦悶。</p>
<p>營業失敗，環境困苦的朋友，對於新年楚沒有好感的，他們祇有嫉視，祇有煩悶。譬如：某商店於年度終結，得知自己虧損資金一百萬萬，店員傷亡八十萬萬，而且資產羅掘已空，股東怨聲載道，那經理，協理等遇到新年，當然沒有歡欣，祇有悲傷了。但一個人在窮極無聊時，往往會發生一種遐想，做着一種幻夢，雖然現代是科學的，但他也會迷信「神」，於是便有起「兜喜神方」的行動，希望在「兜」的時候，遇見了「喜神」，替他解除舊的困苦，給予他一個新的幸福。</p>
<p>某商店的經理協理，現在正陷入萬般苦難中，在想「兜喜神方」，但不曉得喜神在那方？請敎術士，而那糊塗的術士也祇含混地說西南和西北，沒有肯定的答復。弄得他們祇好胡亂瞎鬧！</p>
<p>然而，我們却可以吿訴那商店的經理和協理：今年喜神在東方，快回頭去！</p>
<h3 id="c133">新年漫想 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— 童而</p>
<p>根據我們鄕間的俗例，凡過年，一家人是必需團團圓圓的。除夕的晚上敬鬼神，祭祖宗；還要集合全家，吃一頓豐盛的年飯。——凡有子弟作客他鄕，無法趕回家來的，必在席上給擺一副空的盅筷，算是替他留着座位。道樣的請生人，有點近乎祭亡靈的辦法了，人們却並不忌諱。戰士和詩人也許是不耍家的吧？但他們都是俗人，家庭的觀念深得出奇，一副空盅筷，也耍使它參與這一年一度的「天倫之樂」了。</p>
<p>自然，這說的是陰曆的新年，陽曆的新年，與他們幾乎無關。因為他們都是「愚民」，「政治認識」落伍的居多數。</p>
<p>然而我想：人壽有限，在舊年結束，新歲開始的時候，無論是親朋骨肉，自然而然地懷念起來，而且想設法團聚一下，倒也很合乎人情，算不得什麼可笑的。——今天巳經是除夕了，年飯未必有得吃，但歲暮天寒，對於抗戰中離散了的朋友，忽然也些「臨風依依」，不勝懷念起來。</p>
<p>因為在上海生活了已經好幾年，漸漸熟識，而且不妨推心置腹，除了「抗戰」「救國」以外還可以談談私話的朋友，也就有了不少。可是抗戰一起，一半以上却都風流雲散了。他們，有的救國無門，却又迫於饑寒，祇好做時代落伍者，悄悄的躱到鄕間去「賦閑」，「賦」了一年多，巳經「賦」得瘟頭瘟腦，寫起信來，滿紙牢騷，充滿着「婆婆媽媽」氣了，却仍然無法可想。有的，是在上海被送了「孤島一這雅號之後，　着一種由悲憤，恐懼，懷戀……糾結起來的情緒，匆匆忙忙地走散了的。他們轉輾於香港，武漢，長沙，桂林，重慶，或者遠走西北，為抗戰工作着，呼吸着自由的空氣，然而却受着流離之苦，受着死亡的威脅。有的，飄然遠引，消息毫無了，是在活着做戰士，還是巳經流血做烈士了呢？——不知道。有的却確乎是在抗戰中間，不聲不響地為疾病折磨死了的。哦，對了，還有一位朋友，我沒有忘記過，他在夏天跳了海，他不是戰士，但他的死却的確是因為抗戰。……</p>
<p>我一一懷念着這些朋友。</p>
<p>在戰亂中離散了的，當然不止是朋友。「田園寥落干戈後，骨肉流離道路中」，今年的年夜飯能够坐得團團圓圓，座無空席的，我想，大的是也不多的了。一個人能够一心一德，祗惦記着抗戰，惦記着前綫的戰士，後方的民衆，至於茶飯無心，剖瓜而起河山破碎之痛，吃肉而有置身刀俎之想，我是也極其拜服的。但這樣的超人，我看未必有。佳肴羅列，美酒芬芳，却是滿桌的空盅筷，凡是普通人，恐怕是難免有些悵惘的罷？單說我自己，雖然在這樣的「非常時期」，也還有些不忘於「個人情感」，不時想起一些無關國計民生，世道人心的事來。這有時彷彿也使我有些「殆矣」之感，但翻悔之意，即當此除舊更新之際，也還是沒有。此刻現在，想想那些離散了的朋友，倒是也很有些悠然神往之意了。</p>
<p>我想，倘有一天，抗戰勝利，鼙　聲休，大家忽又重聚在一起的時候，那當是怎樣激動的情景呢？——我想像不出，但我確信一定會有那樣的一天的。而那一天，也必然是中國的更生的誕辰，到那時候，我們再度一個空前的在歡的新年罷。</p>

<p>第一回　獨臂翁組織自由村　雙胞女禮瞻先烈墓</p>
<p>「城風雨近重陽」，這天時是不會差的。近來這一次雨落了有十幾天，落得人家有些悶頭悶腦。但今天是放晴了，滿天的癡雲都推下去了；空氣也變為高爽了；烏兒在枝頭，成羣結隊的，囀卉着和悅的歌聲了；花兒在階前籬畔，雖然帶雨經霜，也放出各種可愛的顏色來了。「眞是一個好天氣呀！人人起來時，都是如此說。因為那一天，正是吾中華民國四十年的國慶雙十節，那時雲霧全掃，氣象淸明，大家都歡欣鼓舞起來。又因為中國為了持久戰，奮力苦鬭，瘡痍未復，直到了近年來，方纔略舒了一口氣。所以在這個紀念日上，要大大地慶祝一天。這紀念日，除了政府在首都內，有閱兵，祭殉國將士墓，開國際宴會等諸禮節外，允其普及於民問。雖是一個小小鄉村，他們也是興高采烈地舉行那國慶紀念日。我今且說離蘇州不遠，在蘇嘉鐵路的近傍，有一個村子，喚作自由村。這村是個新村，現在那裏，已有了一百四五十家人家。而那邊管理村治的人，因為遷居來的人家，逐漸增多，所以還開闢了不少地方，建築了許多房舍。那村裏的風景也還不惡，疎柳小橋，環山抱水，也有好幾家別式的房子。村中的設備一切，也很完善，這是因為中國近年來努力建設，而允注意於地方自治。因此各處鄉村，都能自己料理自己家鄕的事，將從前那種土豪劣董制度，一律打破。地方上人士，有了公共道德，有了法定秩序，就好辦得多了。那個村子裏，有個小學校，名字就喚做「自由村小學校一，學生倒有二百人光景。原來這學校裏，不但收容了本村的兒童，便是鄰近別村的兒童，也有來附讀的。雖然是個小學，定的程度，却和戰前的初中二年級差不多。最妙者，這位小學校的校長，只有一隻膀子，人稱獨臂校長。雖然只有一隻膀子，那隻膀子，却還指揮如意，並不感覺得不便。不過他穿的衣服，還是兩隻袖子，但一隻袖子，裹面却是虛飄飄的，只是有袖而無臂了。</p>

<p>— 沆瀣濟主</p>
<p>恭賀新禧</p>
<p>在上海掌故範圍之內，今日本應譚新年風俗，特殊是數十年來新年習俗之演變。顧此等事，在筆者殊無興味，無已，今日之「掌故譚」，在實質上祇能易之為「雜譚」。</p>
<p>憶去歲新年，正値我軍西移不久，首都又連告失陷，海上風鶴頻驚，幾成為絕頂恐怖地，新年之樂，實有難言。今為時不過一年耳，其形勢已有大變易。日軍泥足，愈陷愈深，我軍退出武漢，數月以來，日人不惟毫無進展，且疊遭失敗，焦慮惶急，無時無地不足以見之。而我形勢，則日趨有利。新年旣到，陽春繼來，凡屬國人，當同有此感。</p>
<p>然今茲之新年，實猶在苦鬥之中，盡情娛樂，實應有待。旣勝利之有期，殊不得不望國人繼續作最後之努力。若是，則將來抗戰既勝，建國亦成，再譚今日上海之掌故，當更能津津樂道，提醒讀者之精神也</p>
<p>余巳言之，吾人抗戰，勝利已可期，祇有待於最後之努力。此努力之方向當如何？自原則言之，自不外發揚偉大之抗戰精神，使抗戰勝利之途，能早日到達。因今日之一切工作，雖因抗戰之發展而日趨深化，終令人有不足之感也。</p>
<p>如抗戰到底，抗戰亦非到底不能制勝，我蔣委員長巳一再言之，全國民衆，亦深信捨此無他途。乃在精衛者流，竟揚言媾和，其荒謬實趨絕項。吾人在今日，雖尙不敢言汪氏之言，含有若何背景，惟其言諭之不當，其足以危害抗戰，則爲顯然之事實。此種言諭對諸多動搖份子，亦將有影響。此余今日向諸君恭賀新禧，不得不望諸君特予注意，從各方面努力，加以根絕也。</p>
<p>再則前方將士，正浴血抗戰，後方難民，則喁喁載途，國家各種實施，尤期待於雄厚之經濟。凡此種種，皆無一不有關於抗戰之前途。余敢以國民一份子之立塲，向讀者諸君呼籲。新年歲首，例多浪費，此種種之浪費，在今日實爲不當。殊段能加節約，以所節餘款，獻之國家，獻之前方將士，獻之後方難民，並盼多方勸募，俾能集腋成裘，此亦加速抗戰成功之道。</p>
<p>其他應作各項，諒為讀者深知，不再驁叙，綜合言之，余個人之希望，則爲深盼讀者諸君，利用此新年機會，遵照我最高當局之指示，實行節的，獻諸國家，並堅次自己抗戰勝利之信念。使此慣例之新年，在歷史上別創新意，使新年生活亦成為抗戰化。</p>

<p>— 萍</p>
<p>今天是民國二十八年的元旦，我首先對讓者諸君，說聲「恭賀新禧！」其實國難臨頭，我們想到正在浴血抗戰的數百萬將士，和戰區無數的被難同胞，都在悲壯慘烈中過活，讀者諸君，試閉目靜思，必有無限感觸，而熱血奔騰的了！</p>
<p>上海市民，當此國族危急存亡的關頭，還依然優哉游哉的酣歌恒舞，苟安偷生，說起來眞是罪孽深重！但話得說回頭來，住在孤島般的上海市民，營營逐逐，終日辛勤，精神難免困頓；要調　這苦悶的生活，恢復那疲乏的精神，自然也少不了正當的游藝。</p>
<p>時序更新，在此歲首，我們對海上游藝界，也得有個最低限度的希望，作為這一年度進取的準繩。第一：希望游藝界當局者，勿孳孳為利，要放大眼光，為觀衆着想，如設備方面如何使觀衆滿意？如何使游藝間接的有利於整個的國族？第二：希望游藝界從業員，編導與演出方面，注重占來忠孝節烈，禮義廉恥種種大敎訓，宜傳新思想，灌　新智識，以收通俗敎育的效果；第三：希望愛好游藝的人，認消自己的地位，勿作過分或不合理的游樂。而在掏錢的時候，須惦念我們國族的處境，而量力捐輸，以盡國民的義務；例如「一元還債運動一，與救濟難民」，都是當前大家應該效力的機會。</p>
<h3 id="c138">關於梅蘭芳博士 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— 倪秋萍</p>
<p>關於梅博士，人人知道是伶界大王。有人說：梅蘭芳不應稱伶界大王。說這種話的人，多少有偏見的。論聲名，全球都知道。論唱功，做工，扮相，那一個比得上他？為什麽他不是伶界大王？難道你是伶界大王嗎？</p>
<p>在家裏，下人都稱他「大爺」。他的秘書李斐叔君。稱他「先生」。也有些梨園行朋友，稱他「梅老闆」。也有人稱他「梅先生」。那些老朋友都呌他「畹華」。那位敎他英文的洋老師呌他Dr．Mei。博士在接受許多不同的稱呼之下，總是和顏悅色。對朋友始終是九十度鞠躬，接着還要握手。他那種態度是好極了。人家祇知道他在台上好看，不知道在平常的時候還要和氣，而好自然，那種誠懇的樣子，使人家深深的印在腦子裏。誰都願意跟他常見面。</p>
<p>在家裏吊嗓子起來是了不得的響，耳膜差不多要受損傷的。我極願意我的耳朶一下子被他震聾了才痛快，因為實在是太動聽了。</p>
<p>在那間會客而實在是書房的屋子裏，惟滿了千把册的洋文書，全是文學和戲劇的名著。一忽兒老師來敎畫，一忽兒洋老師來敎英文。扇面小立軸等，都是人家來「敬求法繪」。名聲一大，就這一點不好辦——你要畫吧，來不及。不盡呢，得罪人。梅博士有時候也稍一皺眉，表示無法可辦之意。但是終於給人一件一件畫好了送去。</p>
<p>去年上海的砲聲是太　了。我們在一塊兒說着話，忽然來一下大聲的炸彈。我的心嚇得直跳，不由得站了起來。但是博士說：「不要緊。別怕，別那麼胆子小」。我覺得梅蘭芳簡直不是伶界大王。是什麽呀？我看他是和平之神。這是咱們東亞的和平之神。</p>
<p>「從善如流」是一句話而已，誰曾實行過呢？博士倒有點這個意思，所以他天天有進步。我聽他唱生死恨，有兩處地方稍差。——一處是二六「張賊一怒將奴賣」的「將」，不如高唱來得好聽。一處四平調「一縱死黃泉也好安排」的「黃泉兩字離得太遠。我是一個有點不知高低的人，當時便跟他說這兩處可以改良。在旁人一定要心說你是什麽東西，敢來跟我說這個，不配。博士是好極了，他說：是的一對。眞得改」。最近登台，便眞的改了。這種地方，實在不是普通一般人所能學得來的，所以我在佩服他的藝術之外，尤共佩服他的學問。這是眞的學問，我速一點影踪都沒有</p>
<p>他對於朋友是熱心得了不得。平時自奉甚儉，速多開一只電燈都要算計算計。應當開還是不應富開？可是他眞帮人家的忙，凡是請求他，只要有道理，他多少會給的。可算得有求必應。去年北方一亂，梨園行也曾暫停演戲。姚五爺（玉芙）來信說，同行竟有苦得沒法活命的人不少，他一封快信就是五千元捐出去，以前對於老輩裏頭沒飯吃的，也是按月津貼。博士在這種地方實在是一個大善士，活菩薩。你想他對一般朋友都如此。（寫到這裏想起徐慕雲君前在本刊說他不知父名，實在有些那個）</p>
<p>我們平常沒有看見過博士的，以為他不知是一個怎樣的人物。等你跟他認識了，知道他是仁愛和平的君子，並且一定不會看見他疾言厲色的。他充滿着喜氣，像孩子一樣的天眞活潑，像長者一樣的可親。我以為梅博士實在是一個非常的人物。</p>
<p>梅博士目從在香港出演之後，就在那裏作寓公了。有人說他從此不再演唱的了，這事急壞了許多梅迷的朋友。我的朋友中有位楊畹農先生，唱念兩項都可以以偽亂眞，其决便算是上海的沈柏年先生了。</p>
<h3 id="c139">談談無線電話劇 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>無綫電話劇，亦稱廣播劇，是由無綫電廣播的話劇。在歐美各國，自從無錢電收音機普遍的流行之後，就有許多愛好劇藝的人利用無綫電試騐各種各樣的方法來播送話劇。關於無綫電話劇的編製，表演與配音等等，都有專鬥研究的書報，供給同好的藝人們公開地硏討。所以他們的播音話劇團體很多，應時而生的編劇者，演員，和配音技師等也各有各的特長，與舞臺劇的編者，演員，和舞臺裝置技師們分道揚鏕；他們的目的就是要使那些無力進劇塲來鑒賞話劇的廣大羣衆可以在街頭卷尾，甚至於人跡稀少的窮鄉僻壤的農民們也能够藉着無綫電收音機的魔力，儘量來飽嘗劇藝的美果。</p>
<p>無綫電話劇的無上權威就在牠能够無限制地吸收聽衆，較之任何形態的戲劇，因受舞臺和劇塲容量的拘束，不能任意吸收過量的觀衆，誠有天壤之別。牠不需要舞臺，不需要燈光，不需要佈景，更不需要貼街報，發傳單，或是登報紙的廣吿，因為無綫電廣播的宣傳力量可以超過任何印刷品的宣傳力量。</p>
<p>無綫電話劇的進步雖然是很決，（在中國可說是近七年來只見退步不見進步，因為「吃開口飯」的朋友們對於這新興的藝術太不注意，只知道借牠來帮助「吃飯」，而不肯多動腦筋，想出「吃」更多的「飯」的新方法來。）但是牠的美中不足之處是人人都可以看得見的。這就是牠只能給人聽不能給人看——猶之乎默片時代的影片只能給人看不能給人聽同樣地引起缺憾。</p>
<p>這一種缺憾，我相信，不久的將來，就有若干無綫電學者和發明家們來補救的。但是現階級的無綫電話劇也有牠特殊的風味，就是能够使每一個聽衆在自己站着或是坐着的地點靜靜地聽，默默地想，想見任何偉大設備的舞臺所佈不出的美景，任何偉大修養的劇人所做不出的表情，允其可貴的就是受不到在劇塲中所無法避免的羣衆感。就是無綫電聽衆的心理是個人的而不是羣衆的，所以印象的深刻决不是任何形態的戲劇所能够企及的。</p>
<h3 id="c140">新年與游藝 <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— 希同</p>
<p>今天是大年初一，編者要我說幾句話；可惜婁子匡的「中國新年風俗志」和張次溪的「北平歲時志」之類的書都巳贈給學校圖書館，只得就我手邊所有的一點寒傖材料來獺祭一番。</p>
<p>游藝與戲劇一樣，大的是盛於宋朝的吧，我就從宋朝說起。北宋有孟元老「東京夢華錄」的記戰。卷十除夕條記儺儀云「皇城親事官諸班直戲假面，繡畫彩衣，執金槍龍旗。」這與後來戲劇中的臉譜和服裝是頗有關係的。</p>
<p>南宋有三部記載。吳自牧的「夢梁錄」卷一有「元旦」「元宵」諸條。有云：「姑以舞隊言之，如淸音·遏雲·掉刀·鮑老·胡女·劉袞·喬三敎·喬迎酒·喬親事·焦鎚架兒·仕女杵歌·諸國朝·竹馬兒·村田樂·神鬼·十齋郞各社不下數十。更有喬宅春·悍龍船·踢燈·鮑老·駞象社·官巷口蘇家巷二十四家傀儡，衣裝鮮麗，細旦戴花朶，有珠翠冠兒，腰肢織裊，宛若婦人。「周密的「武林舊事」卷二也有「元正」「元夕」諸條，所列「大小全棚傀儡」名目允多，除上述者外，還有查查鬼·李大口·賀豐年·長瓠斂·兎吉·吃遂·大憨兒·　妲·麻婆子·快活三郎·黃金杏·瞎判官·快活三娘·沈承務·一臉膜·貓兒相公·洞公觜·河東子·黑遂·王缺兒·交椅·夾棒·屛風·穿心國入質·孫武子敎女兵·緋綠社·鳳阮嵇琴·撲胡蝶·回陽丹·大樂·瓦鼓·喬樂神·喬捉蛇·喬學堂·喬像生·喬師娘·獨自喬·地仙·裝態·鼓板·踏蹺·撲旗·獅豹蠻牌·耍和尙·散餞行·貨郞等·其中竹馬兒後來也用在舞台上，再後纔改用馬鞭子。如果現在舞台上也用竹馬，那末大家就都要以為滑稽了；但這遺跡却保留在兒童的遊戲裏·係鮑老·劉袞·六國朝·喬捉蛇·麻婆子·貨郞·獅豹　牌·四國朝·竹馬兒·散餞行之類，後來都成了南北的曲牌名，也許就是引用牠們原來的音樂或調子到戲劇裹去的吧？灌圃耐得翁的「都城紀勝」無元旦專條，不具引。南宋小朝廷如此酣嬉，無怪其亡之速，書名「夢粱，」蓋有深意存焉。夢梁錄序云：「時異事殊，城池園囿之富，風俗人物之盛，焉保其席如疇昔哉！緬懷往事，殆猶夢也。」武林舊事序云：「朝歌暮嬸，酣玩歲月，意謂人生正復如此，初不省承平樂事為難遇也。及時移物換，憂患飄零，追想昔遊，殆如夢寐而感慨係之矣。」這正是我們最好的一個借鑑。</p>

<p>因此北平曾出了一張畫報，中開畫着他，上首畫着老譚，下首畫着富英，在他嘴裹吐出兩條綫，綫的那頭，都盡了個圈兄，上首對着老譚的圈裏寫道：「你的兒子不如我的兒子」。下首對着富英就說：「你的爸爸不如我的爸爸」。不想這張報竟被他瞧見，他氣不憤的說道：照這樣說來，豈不是「就是我不是玩意麼」？小培添補了這句，的確很對，一時平津都傳為笑譚。你想他的為人是如此洩氣，他老爺子的玩意，他又焉能得着一星半點呢？至於他的令味，就與老兄大不相同了。</p>
<p>老姑娘天生的聰明伶俐，所以才深得老譚的歡心，老譚在家練功吊嗓子的時候，她總是不離左右，因為應用的東西，都歸她保管，該耍甚麽，只要老譚一提，早就檢來送到面前。吊嗓子的時候，燒口烟，倒盌茶，也是她伺候的地道，就是老頭兒過足癮，躺在烟炕上，自己揣摹個好腔兒，唸幾句話白，也是老姑娘聽得最眞切。等到譚氏晚年，每日貴客盈門，一般貝子貝勒，凡是想討敎幾句唱的，全得先把老姑娘運動好嘍。假使別人不大好意思催促老頭兒唱一個「大段」，那麼老姑娘就在燒烟的時候，拿話斵着老爺子高興；並挿嘴道：「旣是某貝勒爺煩您這一段，這個面子不好撥呀！請您抽了這一口，消遣一段吧」老頭兒見姑娘怎麼一說，也這好唱了起來。還有像叔岩這一輩人，都不敢當面請求；况且老譚還有個藏奸的惡習，只要瞧見有內行人到他家來，那怕他正在吊着嗓子，他都會立時停了下來，所以叔岩他們都常常躱在在門房偷聽，比方說：「碰碑」的反二黃老學不會，就先同老姑娘商量好，等會兒胡琴一定調門，她先說道：「別定這麼高的絃呀！今個老爺子要吊碰碑吶」。一面又向老頭兒說道：「是不是你吶，這一段反調，不是老沒唱啦麼」？其實老頭兒年紀大啦，每天吊的什麽戲，那裏還能記在心裏，還不是由他愛女支使擺佈麽？</p>

<p>— 大孩子</p>
<p>新年了，小朋友們，國家雖然仍舊在抗戰中長成，民族雖然仍舊在苦難中奮鬥，焦土千里，人畜犧牲；然向，當此一年開始的第一天和我們相見時，我們雖不必說什麼恭喜發財」的空話。可是總得把自己的過去檢點一下，是吾有什麽不合的地方，如果有，那宋自然應當改過。應當糾正，從今天以後，不要讓它冉有，即使沒有，也要加倍目勉。同時，我們也不能不有一個新的希望，來寄託於這未來的一年；小朋友們，現在我便把我的新年希望，來作了元旦的禮物，獻給親愛的小朋友們吧。</p>
<p>第一個希　，我希望小朋友們從今天起，加倍努力自已的學業，少讀課，少貪玩，多讀書，多讀報，造成一個科學的頭腦，養成一種前進的精神；閒來無事，研究一占實用知識，講一些民族英雄，古時聖賢或世界偉人的歷史，看幾本有益的故事，此外，也不要忘記了寫日記。</p>
<p>第二個希望，我希望小朋友們從今天起，要革除一切不良的惡嗜好，把自己的德，智，體，三育修養起來成爲一個全勇敢的</p>
<p>第三個希望，我希望小朋友們從今天起，將糖果玩具錢節省下來，去獻給國家救國，去救濟許多無家可歸的難民；同時，要勸同學或父母親戚，呌他們也實行節的救國，節的救難。</p>
<p>第四個希望，我希望小朋友們從今天起，要勸自己的父母或親戚，呌他們不要去做漢奸，不耍去出賣良心，出賣民族利益。</p>
<p>末了，我把我四個新希望寫完了之後，還有一個好像多餘而却又必要的希望，那就是，請諸位親愛的小朋友別要把我這份薄的禮物忽視了，希望每一個小朋友都能够實行起來。最後，我照例得擱筆向列位小朋友們道一聲「新年進步，新春幸福！」</p>

<p>元旦日，是新年的第一天，是多麼的熱鬧啊：街道上的店舖干裹，早巳擺着花花綠綠的東西，小朋友們也穿着了新衣服，玩新的有趣的玩具，非常快樂的慶祝新年的來臨。可是新年和舊年到底有什麼分別呢？除了人們在外表上佈置得美麗一些，在目然環境中一些也沒有改變，所以新年在慶祝外，還有更重要的意義，那就是我們在做人和學業方面，是否有新的進步，讓我們來檢討一下吧！</p>
<p>一，對于節的運動是否始終實行——我為何先要提起呢？因在這幾天中物質的美麗最容易引誘你們而忘掉了這重大責任，這固然是人們所免不掉的，可是在道國難期中，把這筆不需要的耗費，積下來，就能救幾倏性命，加以嚴冬已到，小朋友身上都添了寒衣，而那些無家可歸的難民，前綫浴血的兵士，一伴寒衣，對于他們極端需要的，所以只要你們不半途而廢，努力節的，那麽成績一定不會錯的。</p>
<p>二，對于學業和品行上有吾進步——在學業方面，有沒有得到眞正的學問，如果一時因貪懶或愛玩的緣故，或不知讀書方法，以致這學期成績不佳，品行方面，待人待已，是吾不虛偽，和藹誠實，假使沒有做到，新年眞是我們立志改進的好機會。</p>
<p>其他如養成良好的習慣，銀鍊體格健全，只要你們有次心，有毅力，有進取之心，不難做到適應未來的新的環境，而不致做一個被淘汰的落伍者了，就從枕頭下面，取出預備着的紅紙封好的壓歲錢給他，他接到這一塊錢，道聲謝謝，於是在新年裏，買糖果，買玩具，買賀年片……用個精光。</p>
<p>去年，玉兒的故鄕，變作了火錢，跟着父母逃難，跋涉千里，吃盡苦楚。元旦的那一天，正住在某地山村的草棚裏。他照例早晨起來，向父母賀年。父親給他一提醒，才知是元旦，想摸出壓歲錢來。玉兒</p>

<p>（二）交換　元旦日的早晨，王生的大哥對他說：『弟弟的帽子，已經有些嫌小戴不着了，還是送給你吧！』</p>
<p>王生笑嬉嬉地說：『六哥，謝謝！不過我將來頭大了，不能再戴時，一定也送給你得啦！』</p>
<p>（三）變矮　王生的姊姊是個長子，她覺很不美觀！後來人家吿訴伊一個法子，』在下雨天躲在門邊撑撑傘，身子就會變小變矮啦！』</p>
<p>這天，王生的姊姊因為咳嗽，要吃生梨，而雨下得很大；王生就拿錢出門了：姊姊連忙逍出來，問道：</p>
<p>『弟弟，為什麽不撑傘呢？』姊姊，要變矮呀！』王生答道。道：「現在我們過着逃難生活，用了一塊錢就少一塊錢，我不想買什麼無用的東西，請爸爸不必給我了。』</p>
<p>今年元旦，玉兒已隨着家長來到上海了。他走到父母床前，恭賀新禧的時候，父親又把壓歲錢預備好，納在他的手裏。他接了過去，放在袋裏，問父親道：「爸爸，今年這一塊錢，你猜我怎樣用掉？」。父親道：「不是買好吃的，便是買好玩的，我猜得對不對？一玉兒不答，又問母親。母親笑道：「我猜不出你的心事。除了你爸爸猜的好吃好玩之外，還有好看好聽，或許你想看一回電影罷？」玉兒笑道：「爸爸媽媽，都猜錯了，我想把這一塊錢，盡國民的責任。在學校裹，聽得老師說，現在有人發起一元還債運動，不論老的小的，凡是中華民國的國民，都應該拿出一塊錢來，積少成多，償還外債。我因為爸媽給我的壓歲錢，恰巧一元，可以參加這一元還債運動，所以非常快樂，次定過了新年，帶到學校裏，交給老師，請他彙集同學的捐款一起貢獻國家了。」玉兒的父親聽了，撫着他的頭髮讀道：「好孩子！你的打算眞好！我同你媽媽，也要各捐一元哩。」</p>
<h3 id="c146">怎樣猜算二十八年的星期？ <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 綠萍</p>
<p>流光好駛，又是一個新年了？新年裏小朋友們，做些什麽有趣味的遊戲呢？</p>
<p>在這裹吿訴你一個新奇的遊戲，就是怎樣去猜算二十八年的星期？現在先列一張表在下面：</p>
<p>假使有人問你：某月某日是星期幾？你祗要把他說出來的日數，和表內某月格子裹數字，加起來，然後用7來除，所得的餘數就是星期幾。</p>
<p>例如有人問你，一月十八日是星期幾？我們把一月格子下面的6，和他說出來的日數18相加，和數是24，再用7除，餘數是3，那末，就是星期三了。</p>
<p>再如有人問你：三月四日是星期幾？我們把三月格子下面的2和他說出的日數4，加在一起，和數是6，6是不能除7的，那末6就是星期6，所以凡是加出來的數目，沒有7大，就用不着除，它就可以代表是星期幾。</p>
<p>還有一點，要注意的就是：例如十二月十日，是星期幾，我們加出來的和數是14，用7去除，和數是〇，〇是代表星期日的，所以十二月十日是星期日。</p>
<p>最後小朋友們，假使能照上列方法去做，那末某月某日是星期幾？在一二分鐘內，就可猜到，而且沒有一些錯誤，大家看了以後，不妨目己試一下吧！</p>
<h3 id="c147">新年的算術遊戲 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— 李毓鏽</p>
<p>小朋友，新年到了。這裏送給諸位的一套禮物。今年是一個有趣的算術遊戲。今年是四暦1939年，又是中華民國28年，因此就拿這幾個數字來做遊戲了。</p>
<p>我們先在心裏想個數目，譬如你新年八歲了，你就想8，再用上面的1，9，3，9，2，8六個數目字，用加，减，乘，除的符號連起來，使算出的結果，恰巧等於8。這種算式也不止一個的，所以我們也可以呌了幾個朋友在一起做，看誰做得快，看誰做得頂簡單。同時還可以改變花樣，換些數目字來玩，這趣味是無窮的。</p>
<p>這遊戲的好處是很多的：第一，可以使心算的技術進步，算得快，算得對。第二，可以鍜鍊思想，使你的思想敏捷，第三，還可以做智力測騐，競賽起來，可以看出你的朋友那一位頂聰明。這三件也就是我送這套禮物的用意。以下附了十二個例子，請諸位看看：</p>
<h3 id="c148">白雪公主　（一） <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— 天孫</p>
<p>在好久好以前，也不知是那一代那一年了。在某處地方。有一個小小的王，也不知道它的名兒呌甚麼。這國中的女王，出落得花朶兒似的，非常的美麗動人。有一個冬天的早上，綿絮樣的白雪，舖滿了大地，伊正坐在盡裹的未窗旁邊，十個白玉雕成般的手指，在忙着刺繡，忽然之間，偶不小心，給那枝銀針，刺破了指尖，一滴猩紅的血，掉在窗外的白雪上，紅白相映，分外的鮮艷。伊低頭看了一下，含着憂思嘆息着，自言自語道：「唉！我是日日夜夜的在盼望着，能够生下一個美麗的女兒來，伊的皮膚，要像雪一樣的白，伊的嘴唇，要像血一樣的紅，伊的頭髮要像我繡架的檀木一樣的烏黑，那才稱了我的心意，此外，我甚麽都不想耍了。」</p>
<p>這樣過了不多時光，果然天從人願，那王后竟生下一個小娃娃來。伊的皮膚眞的像雪那麽白，伊的嘴唇，眞的像血那麼紅，伊的頭髮，眞的像黑檀木那麼黑；王后是再稱心滿意也沒有的了，就給伊起了一個名字，呌做白雪公主。可是王后的福命太　，竟不能永永久的享有這一位玉雪可念的小娃娃：不久就害了一塲重病，任是請了全國的名醫給伊醫治，也是束手無策，終於拋棄了愛女，和世界永別了。</p>
<p>一個王國，是不能沒有王后的，所以不上幾時，國王又續娶了一位新王后，白雪公主就有了一個繼母了。這位新王后，可不像白雪公主的生母那麼溫柔賢淑：生就了的一副壞脾氣，並且是殘酷得很，伊自以為是全世界最美麓的婦人，驕傲得甚麼似的。</p>
<p>王宮中有一間秘密的房間，別的人是不許進去的。那新王后有一面魔鏡裝在那裹，常做實貝一樣的愛護着。無論伊有甚麼事情去向這魔鏡，鏡中自會切切實實地回答伊的，每天伊總得向着鏡子，懇切地問道：「牆上的仙鏡啊！請你回答我，那不是世界中最美麗的女子？」伊這樣一問之後，立刻有一重碧綠色的霧氣，在鏡面上罩住了：按着就有一種奇怪的聲音的從鏡子裹淸淸楚楚地發出來道：「王后，你是世界中最美麗的女子，誰也比不上你的」</p>
<p>但是這個可惡的王后眼看着白雪公主一天一天的長成，又一天一天的美麗起來。伊的心中，就被嫉妬的火燃燒着，再也壓抑不住，覺得非常的痛苦。於是千方百計的要把白雪公主的美貌肥下去，凡是白雪公主所有華美的衣服，全都毀壞了。</p>
<p>這樣不算，王后又命白雪公主做那粗重辛苦的工作，像洗擦地板，揩拭門限等事，全國在伊那小小的身上百般的麼折伊，不許伊得到充分的休息。可憐這金技玉枝般的白雪公主，竟變做了一個極卑賤的女奴了。</p>
<p>然而白雪公主對於那些粗重的工作，並不在意；新王后喚伊做甚麼，伊就照着做甚麽，倒像是很願意的樣子。原來伊有一個秘訣，可以苦中作樂：任是肉體上遭受痛苦和磨折，而精神上却是快快樂樂的。你道是甚麼秘訣，便是夢想。任你在靑天白日，不必睡覺，也儘由你自由自在的夢想着。</p>

<p>— 編者弁言</p>
<p>申報擁有六十六載之光榮歷史，前年十二月下旬，不得巳而中輟：去歲雙十節，改組復刋。復刋之日，嘗向讀者闡述旨趣，當荷各方共鏖。復刋之後，發三宏願：</p>
<p>一、為策進報紙效力起見，務使得銷普遍；</p>
<p>二、為發揮申報品位起見，力求質最精進；</p>
<p>三、為輕减讀者負擔起見，不恤自我犧牲。</p>
<p>此三者，惟有以事實期待讀者鑑定，初非申報所得而自炫；抑鵠的如斯，惟有悉力以赴，復非謂旣臻理想之境界；二三月來，兢兢自勉，凡得機緣，輒謀盡所至善。茲逢歲首，例必擴大篇幅，愛編行『上海特輯』以貢獻於讀者；蓋審時度勢，可信此輯之最能適應需要與時宜也。</p>
<p>特輯以上海為對象，所冀將上海之若干重要事態，述其過去，紀共現狀，估量其將來；其間亦有數題，所涉範圍不限於上海者，亦必其事之重心繫於上海。匝月之前，特輯之規劃粗定，擬題近百；申報同人雖不自菲薄，分任撰述，然問題之方面旣多，豈容率爾操弧：乃分別問題之性質，或請事業之權威，或請學術之專家，各就所長，分別撰文；其有須博訪周咨者，則分別委託專員，奔走紀述。聖的翰大學新聞學系諸君，匡助最多，至可感也。</p>
<p>廣泛之方面，大量之文章，若刋為專書，則三十萬言，可成百頁以上之一大冊；若全部與報紙同日刋行，則如此巨帙，非任何人所得以一日之時間而竟讀之。乃變通往年元旦特刋之辦法，創為新例；卽自元旦起，按日繼續發表，以迄全部文章登載完畢；庶幾報館得從容編排，讀者得從容披覽焉。</p>

<p>— 蔚然</p>
<p>上海一海濱漁村耳，古稱滬凟，滬者，漁具也。其所以名為上海者，明弘治上海縣志卷一沿革中稱，「地居海之上洋故也」。</p>
<p>上海在距今四千餘年前，乃為揚州之城；春秋屬吳，後屬越；戰國屬楚，相傳為楚春申君黃歇封邑，黃浦江據卽因黃歇所開鑿故名，故亦名春申江，簡稱申江。秦置婁縣，領於會稽郡，上海當係婁之南境，漢初屬荊國，後屬吳國，尋又屬江都國，武帝時復為會稽郡，隸於揚州，後漢屬吳郡，隸揚州刺史部，建安中為朱治奉邑。三國吳為婁侯國；晉屬吳郡隸揚州部：宋齊因之。梁天監間省婁縣改置信義縣，上海卽為信義縣南境之地。大同初，復析信義地置崑山縣，仍屬吳郡，上海又為崑山縣地；陳因之，隋省入常熟，尋復置崑山縣改屬蘇州，隸揚州行臺。唐天寳十年，析崑山，海鹽，嘉興三縣地置華亭縣，屬蘇州隸江南東道，其東北境之華亭海，卽今上海境也。五季隸吳越國，初屬開元府，旋屬中吳軍節度使，尋又改屬秀州。宋仍五季之舊，隸兩浙路；南宋慶元初屬嘉興府，上海仍為華亭縣地，其後人烟浩穫，海舶輻輳，漸成大市，乃立市舶提舉司及榷貨塲，名上海鎭。</p>
<p>元至元二十七年，因知府僕散翰文之請求，析華亭縣之長人鄕，高昌鄕，北亭鄉，新江鄕，海隅鄉置上海縣，屬松江府，隸江浙行省，轄境東至海，南至華亭縣境，西至平江路崑山州，北至平江路嘉定州，南北四十八里，東西一百里，領鄉五，領保二十有六。上海初置縣時之區域，大小如此。</p>
<p>明初上海縣屬松江府，直隸南京。嘉靖間，析縣西境之新江鄉，北亭鄉，海隅鄉置靑沛縣，未幾卽廢，萬曆間，復置，又析北亭新江二鄕之未盡者益之。淸初屬府如明代，隸江南右布政使司；康熙初，分隸江蘇布政使司。雍正時，析西南境長人鄉地設南匯縣，嘉慶間再割高昌鄕沿海之地十五圖隸川沙撫民廳。是時上海僅領長人鄉三保，高昌鄉九保，地域竟愈縮愈小，直至淸末，尙屬如此，而未有變更。</p>
<p>民國　建，廢除道，府，州，廳，改為江蘇省直轄。民國三年復設道官制，隸屬滬海道，轄境仍淸季之舊。民國十五年，淞滬商埠督辦公署成立，所轄區域，除上海全縣外，益以寳山縣屬之吳淞，江灣。殷行，彭浦，眞如，高橋等一市五鄉之地，一切行政事務，均受公署管理，不屬於省行政範圍。</p>
<p>民國十六年，國民革命軍奠定上海，確定為上海特別市，直隸於中央政府。上海特別市區範圍除淞滬商埠原有轄境外，更加以寳山縣屬之大塲，楊行二鄉，松江，靑浦兩縣所屬七　鄕之一部，松江縣屬莘莊鄉之一部及南匯縣屬周浦鄉之一部，跨境五縣，轄市鄕三十，佔地二千六百九十二方里，東西廣的七十里，南北　約百餘里。市區界址雖經劃定，然民國十七年時所接收者，僅為上海縣屬之滬南，閘北等十一市鄉，及寳山縣屬之吳淞，高橋等六市鄉，並一律改稱為區。民國十九年五月，國民政府公布市組織法，改各特別市為市，直隸於行政院。同年七月，改稱上海巿；轄境仍舊。</p>
<p>上海市之四界東界川沙縣南匯縣：南界南匯縣；西界嘉定縣，靑浦縣，松江縣；北界寳由縣，又濱揚子江。</p>

<p>上海縣志以明弘治十七年所輯之「上海志」為第一部。淸康熙二十二年修輯康熙上海縣志時，已渺不可見。其後歷决修志，均未能發現是書。上海市通志館素以埋頭苦幹，探索史料聞於世，對於弘治志，竭力搜尋，竟得於前年發現是書於寗波天一閣中。上圖卽為弘治志之一葉。惜巿通志館因戰事而早停止工作矣，惟該館已編就之志稿均將由中華書局印行云。</p>

<p>— 東白</p>
<p>上海因地理上之優勢，早為外商所注意。當淸乾隆時代，英商東印度公司中人卽獻議於公司當局，稱上海為一有望之商港。嘉慶中以申禁雅片之故，本在粵東經商之英人，頗不耐煩，圖闢粵東以外之商埠甚亟，道光十二年派員至滬考察，要求在滬通商，為道台吳其泰所拒絕，未有結果而去。越三年，林則徐在粵焚雅片，英人卽與我國開戰。道光二十年六月英軍陷定海；二十二年四月佔乍浦；五月初八日佔吳淞，十一日佔上海。十五日英軍離上海，溯江而上，進攻鎭江南京，七月初四日英國攻擊南京。我國以不堪新式武器之壓迫，卽宣佈議和。七月二十四日欽差大臣伊里布及耆英與英國全權代表璞鼎查（H.Pottinger）簽訂搆和條的十三款，卽所謂南京條的。該約第二款規定五口通商云：</p>
<p>『　自今以後大皇帝恩准英國人民帶同所屬家眷，寄居沿海之廣州，福州，厦門，寗波，上海等五處港口貿易，通商無礙。英國君主派設領事管事等處，住該五處城邑，專理商賈事宜，與各該地方官公文往來，令英人按照下條開叙之例，淸楚交納貨稅鈔餉等費』。道光二十三年所訂通商善後條的第六款云：</p>
<p>『廣東等五港口，英商或常川居住，或不時來往均不可妄到鄕間任意遊行，更不可遠入內地貿易。中華地方官應與英國管事官，各就地方民情地勢議定界址，不許踰越，以期永久彼此相安。凡係水手及船上人等，俟管事官與地方官先行立定禁的之後方准上岸。倘有英人違背此條禁的，擅到內地遠遊者，不論係何品級，卽聽該地方民人捉拿交英國管事官依情處罪，但該民人等不得擅自毆打傷害，致傷和好』。又第七款云：</p>
<p>『在萬年和的內，言明允准英人携眷赴廣州，福州，厦門，寗波，上海五港口居住不相欺侮，不加拘制。但中華地方官必須與英國管事官，各就地方民情，議定於何地方，用何房屋或基地，係准英人租賃。其價値必照五港口之現在所値高低為準，務求平允。華民不許勒索，英商不許强租。英國管事官每年以英人或建屋若干間，或租屋若干所，通知地方官轉報立案。惟房屋之增减，視乎商人之多寡，視乎貿易之衰旺，難於預定額數』。上列數款均與上海有關，亦卽上海開埠之基本條的，道光二十三年九月十七日第一任英領巴爾福（G.Balfour）挾其翻譯麥華陀（Med　burst）從舟山至上海，越一星期，卽宣吿上海正式開埠。</p>
<p>英國旣打開中國門戶，法美乃亦追踪而至。道光二十四年九月，法與華訂立黃埔條的三十六款。美國於同年五月與華訂立望厦條的。兩種條約均為五口通商之條的也。</p>
<p>上海開埠後，外人陸續來滬居留，設置居留地，卽所謂租界也。最初為英租界，租界有章程，稱地皮章程，或稱地產章程。俗稱洋涇浜章程，英租界弟一决章程在道光二十五年，由滬道宮慕久所公佈，計二十三款，後又增加一款共二十四款，規定邊界，租地手續及外僑應遵守事官，其後外僑屢决自行改訂修正，形成今日公共租界市政法之實質，本來面目全非矣。第一决所訂地皮章程，中文本已不可得；一八五二年一月十七日英文字林西報上載有英文全文，譯文載上海市通志館期刋第一期，學者可取以研究者也。</p>
<p>同治二年以前，上海無所謂公共租界，蓋其時英美兩租界各各獨立也。美租界之成立，係在道光二十八年，發動創立美租界者，為「文監師」，卽文監師路之文惠廉（Wm.J.Boone）牧師，後美租界中治安發生問題，美人提議以美租界合併於英租界，於是公共租界始吿成立。最初英租界面積僅一百三十八畝，光緒廿五年時，公共租界面積為五千五百八十三英畝，換算中國畝數，則為三萬三千餘畝，然越界築路四萬七千餘畝，尙不在內。上列面積數，卽今日之面積數。</p>
<p>上海法租界之起源，係在道光二十七年。第一任領事為敏體尼，今大世界前自北往南之路稱敏體尼蔭路者，卽紀念此領事也。法人最初租得之地極小，僅有兩畝三分八厘五毫，至道光二十九年春，法租界始正式成立，其面積的五十六公頃左右。其界限如下：南至城河；北至洋涇浜；西至關帝廟褚家橋；束至潮州會館，沿河至洋涇浜束角。法租界協定中，並訂明「倘若以後地方不够，再議別地，隨至隨議」。法租界旋於咸豐十一年擴充一决，共面積的增加三公頃之譜；於光緒二十六年又二决擴充，其面積又增一千一百十二畝，速前共一百四十四公頃；民國三年又第三决擴充，租界面積達一千〇二公頃，較諸初起時，擴大至二十倍矣。</p>
<p>公共租界的行政，為工部局所治理。工部局之組織系統，上有納稅外人會，由該會產生董事會，由董事會組織各種事業委員會。董事會下，設一總裁，主持總辦間。總辦間所屬事務為商團，為警務處，為火政處，為衛生處，為工務處，為學務處，為財務處，為情報處等。</p>
<p>工部局董事現為十四人，華五，英五，美二，日二。設總董副總董各一人。華董之設置，係幾經奮鬥，於民國十九年時始吿實現者也。董事會决定工部局之重要行政，並有聘任或辭退局中職員之權。每二週或三週舉行會議一决，平時如遇重要公文，均分送各董事批注意見。</p>
<p>法租界之行政機關為公董局，局董初由法領所任命，後依同治五年及七年公董局之組織法，而改為選舉制；民國十六年一月，又公布新組織法，以臨時委員會代替董事會。委員會中有華董五人，華委三人。華董三人之參加，亦係民國十六年國民革命勝利後，公董局章程修改後之决定。</p>
<p>公董局內部之組織，的分五部：（一）總管理部，（二）市政總理部，內分　政務秘書處，　財務訟事處，　地產一處，　分類營業處，　鹽務處，　衛生救濟處，　宰牲塲，　敎育處，（三）技政總管部：　一般技術研究處，　無綫電台，信號台，天文台，　消防隊，　種植培養處，　公共工程處，（四）司法顧問部，（五）警務總監部。</p>
<p>上海租界法院有三種：一為領事法庭，二為領事公堂，三為特區法院。領事法庭係根據領事裁判權而設立。領事公堂則係由若干國領事所組織，係根據同治八年之地皮章程而設立者。特區法院前身為會審公堂，權力均操諸外人之手，民國十六年經江蘇省政府交涉而收回，設臨時法院。民國于九年，更由國民政府外交部代表與英，美，荷蘭，挪威，巴西五國代表，在南京簽立關於上海公共租界內中國法院之協定，法國代表旋亦補行簽字。上海公共租界之臨時以下接第七版</p>

<p>上海為中國唯一之大商港，其　道卽由黃浦江水道構成。據濬浦局所規定之港區，以江南製造局為港道上端，東溝口為港道下端，全長計五萬四千英尺，中有彎曲五處。兩岸距離，自一千零八十英尺至二千英尺不等。除周家嘴沙灘外，卽最小潮錢，亦有一千至二千英尺之寬度，惟深達二十四英尺之水道，港寬平均僅七百五十英尺而已。港內收容船舶之能力，的在四十萬噸以上，卽二千噸至萬噸之輪船，同時可並舶至七十艘左右焉。</p>
<p>自外洋或沿海各地而來之船隻，須先經揚子江口，然後經吳淞而入黃浦。口外東北海面並無礁石，離海岸三十海里外，有六十英尺之深水；東南海面，多島嶼沙　，頗為航行之障碍，故須循島嶼問所立燈塔浮標等指定之水道而行。</p>
<p>以上海港為中心，水上航路可分為三路：　沿海航路，　內河航綫，　遠洋航路。</p>
<p>沿海航路，通達我國沿梅各埠，計分綫程二：一為南洋航錢，自上海南行經寗波·台州·溫州·福州·厦門·汕頭·香港，以廣州為終點，或亦延展至法屬之海防及西貢；一為北洋航錢，自上海北行，可達海州·靑島·威　行·烟台·天津·營口·大連·秦皇島等地。</p>
<p>內河航綫，亦稱內港航綫，主要者為長江航錢，其次為蘇州河航錢與黃浦江航綫。　長江航綫，由本港出吳淞口上溯長江，經過長江流域各埠，直達重慶，而上海漢口間一段航道長五百九十二英里，最為優美，冬季能容吃水八至十英尺之輸船，夏季能容吃水二十八至卅英尺之輪隻。　蘇州河航綫，蘇州河東流匯於黃浦江；由該河向西北行駛，直達吳縣，計程的三百華里。並通江蘇腹地，如靑浦·崑山·常熟·滸墅關·望亭·蕩口·無錫等地。　黃浦江航錢，由黃浦江向南及西南行駛，通江蘇南部及浙江腹地，到杭州的程五百華里，到吳興的程六百華里。</p>
<p>遠洋航程，通達世界各大商埠。計分中歐航路，中美航路，南洋印度航路，澳洲航路，日本航路，西伯利亞航路等。我國之遠洋航路以大連·上海·厦門·香港四埠為起點，上海適居海岸錢之中段。</p>
<p>沿海航綫，南進一路，似極甚早；而北進一路，則可以元海運為起始。至於遠洋航程，南洋一路於明永樂時鄭和出使西洋，（俗所謂三寳太監下西洋）卽已開通，蓋鄭和去西洋時，有上海人陳常同去者也。</p>
<p>上海地位得有今日之重要，時勢變遷固為一大原因，而其地理上位置之優越，實亦為其發展之基礎。上海縣續志界志云：「上海市當八省之尾閭，沿海七省之中心，太平洋航錢之焦點，」誠能說明上海在地理上之優越矣。</p>

<h3 id="c154">現已到滬之　一九三九式新車特色概述 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>歐美出品在原則上大致相同　式樣機械英美車各擅其勝</p>
<p>無論以機械工程言，或以車身搆造言，一九三九式新車，不論其為美國製，英國製，抑或為歐陸出品，實均有極顯著之進步。新車特色，更僕難數，而允足稱者，則引擎效能大見增加是也。考其所以有此成功，則汽缸頭之改良，進汽管與排汽管之硏究盡善，以及化汽機與發火系之進步，實有以致之。新求引擎效能旣大增加，其動作遂更優越，而燃料之消耗則較省，駕駛則更安全而可靠。按此種種情形，允以小型汽車最為顯而易見。蓋如八匹及十匹馬力式新車，其加速率與爬山力，現巳與十五匹及廿匹馬力之汽車相接近矣。新車懸置方法，亦巳大見進步，吸震裝置允佳，較大型汽車之車架搆製，較前允為堅强鞏固，並頗有採用車身與底盤混合搆造者；再不論大小型汽車，均備存寬敞之行李間，蓋如須裝載笨重行李，祗須將車身後鑲板放平可矣。</p>
<p>一九三九年度英美各車廠所出新車，對於安全問題，允為注重。除設計搆造，在在注意於安全外，即安全玻璃風屏之視綫，現亦巳增加百分之十八至三十，駕駛人視綫所及，其範圍較前寬闊多多。於是汽取肇禍案件，允其是撞傷小孩情事，自可大為减少。裝於轉向柱上之新式調排桿，為一九三九式新車之又一特色，共位置恰在駕駛盤下，運用方法一如舊式，而靈活則遠過之；製造廠家僉認此項裝置，對於駕駛安全，實有莫大關係。蓋駕駛人因此可集中其注意力於路上，而無庸刻刻注意於變速工作也。據一般人之意見，英美車廠所出一九三九式新車，在原則上初無二致，大體上亦均相同；但如就機械與式樣二者而論，則英美車實各擅勝塲云。一九三九式新車，業巳先後到滬，茲略述其概况如次。</p>
<p>（一）迪沙多六缸車　關於機械方面，迪沙多新車，計有新式變速機，獨立前輪懸置，新式高度扭力引擎，以及新式調排等，車身式樣彌壯觀瞻，內部全新裝置，關於空氣之調節，儘可隨心所欲，藉以享受極度之安適。</p>
<p>（一）派克六缸轎車　一九三九式新派克，不僅機搆精巧，式樣且極美妙壯觀。車身為全鋼搆成，絕對安全，非常寬敞。其優點之犖犖大者，計有新式調排桿，新式變速機，及特殊吸震裝置等；乘坐之安適，與駕駛之便利，遠勝於前。</p>
<p>（一）司蒂倍克　說者謂一九三九式司蒂倍克，實為最華貴最漂亮，而以新低價出售之汽車，其新式通風系，使空氣之調節，得以隨心所欲，彌感安適。車身為純鋼搆成，極堅固而安全，至於駕駛，允為得心應手，而汽油與機油之消耗則殊經濟。</p>
<p>（一）道奇六缸汽車　道奇出品，素以安全可靠著稱於世，今則一九三九式新車，為道奇廠銀色週年紀念出品，其設計搆造設備及裝璜允皆悉心規劃，咸臻盡美盡善之境；故其安全可靠程度，允勝於前，其益為汽車界人士所歡迎，蓋有以也。</p>

<h3 id="c155">汽車界的「冬防」 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— 旦華</p>
<p>到了冬天，車主往往為汽車担了不少心思，大概是因為冬天多嚴霜重霧的緣故。其實冬令行車，只要對於冰雪霜霧，預防得法，很是快樂的。至於預防方法，應分汽車本身和汽車間兩方面來講，普通車主認為困難的，就是不可分離的始動和冰凍兩個問題。始動的困難，一則由於空氣寒冷，二則由於機油膠著，三則由於電池衰弱。這三種困難，都易補救，要使引擎和汽車間溫度適宜，儘有簡單而便宜的方法，可供採行。汽車廠商常有一種冬天用的機油介紹給車主，車主不妨照辦，至電池的電力，必要時亦可自行調正。汽車開到了路上，應有一對焦點適宜的車燈，其决是一個前窗刷子，亦屬必需之物。</p>
<p>汽車間的保暖</p>
<p>汽車停留外面三四小時，尤其在夜閒，必有冰凍之虞，應在水箱部份用些防凍物，以資預防。現在的汽車常有節熱器，用以調節引擎然度，或裝置水箱百頁板，使引擎不易變冷，倘使沒有這種設備，最好三保溫套以代之，萬一汽車停留外面較久，把發動機罩遮蓋起來，亦是有用的。</p>
<p>汽車保暖</p>
<p>就汽車間而輪，應有暖器，可就墻邊裝置水汀，或用簡省方法，如置備水箱燈，使水不易冷，或裝置油池放熬器，使機油熱度相當。</p>
<p>電池要注意</p>
<p>冷天電池失去效力，最堪注意，其預防之法，應利用汽車間電力，使電池保持相當力量，所費有限，而利益很大。</p>
<p>霧燈和路燈</p>
<p>冬天多重霧，所以霧燈極關重要，不可不備，眞正　霧燈，大概在速度每小時五英里至二十五英里時，最是見效，過此限度，則在正常氣候中，須將光度增强。因此限制之故，許多駕駛者喜用一種副燈之長，故收效最宏。</p>
<p>倘只用一盞路燈，應裝在前面車之中央，與水箱下部平行，惟多墩駕駛者喜用一對，分裝水箱兩邊，因有時兩燈光錢，長短參差，互相配稱，合用之便臻美善也。</p>
<p>長途防冰雪</p>
<p>冬令行車，車胎允宜採用上品，允以有防滑棱者為宜。倘途程較遠，難免大雪，則道路凍結，亦在意中，在此情形之下，輪鏈是斷不可少的。</p>
<p>內部有改良</p>
<p>又從前冬季行車，往往認為可怕之事，緣氣候旣冷，汽車方面亦感種種不適，例如手指脚趾，呵凍需時，前窗汽水擬結，須時時揩拭，可是現在不同了，車內可裝暖器，駕駛者無須穿著厚衣，便已溫暖如春。至前窗裏面凝凍，照現在最新辦法，只須加添刷子，便亦絕無問題了。</p>
<h3 id="c156">一九三九年　新式小蘭腦之優點 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 陳文旭</p>
<p>蘭腦為法國著名汽車廠之一，歷年所出各車均以服務社會為宗旨，茲該廠為服務社會更進一步起見，特製就嬌小玲瓏蓓蓓蘭腦一種，而命其名曰「秀華」。按該廠歷年所出各車，其首均冠有如，賽而得一「拔類美」「偉華」等種種名稱，本年度所出之「秀華」，亦復如是，並非副牌，此蓋筆者在介紹該車之前須先聲明者也。蓓蓓蘭腦「秀華」，為現代最新式之雙門四缸小汽車，設計新穎，規畫縝密，選料謹嚴，工作精緻，引擎型小而效宏，車型小而服務廣，此為該廠歷年所得之經騐，從事改良而所出之車也。茲特將其優點概述如左：</p>
<p>安全　車身乃整塊純鋼所製成，所裝玻璃均係保險，車量重心下垂，行駛穩捷，車身修短適中，姿態苗條，益以新式直接指揮之塞車，淸晰之視綫，簡易之駕御，安全設施允稱周密。該車形體雖小，而蓄油池則設在後部，此可見該廠對於乘客安全之設施無微不至矣。</p>
<p>效能　四汽缸小引擎，汽筒雖僅具一立公分之容量，然所產生之效能，却極偉大，而費用則殊經濟。蓋每加侖十五英里，每小時六十五英里，同時能載乘四人，及其行李等，此非其經濟設計之卓越，已顯然高人一等乎？以效能言之，引擎力大，起步勁捷，衝勢優越，而最感愉快者，厥為該車能在三擋排起步，</p>
<p>秀麗　新式蓓蓓蘭腦「秀華」汽車，式樣悅”壯觀，姿態秀麗動人，車舵輕鬆，駕御簡易，在狹小之道路，亦能旋轉自若，毫無困難。</p>
<p>舒適　蓓蓓蘭腦「秀華」，前後座位寬敝適意，裝璜設置周到無比，雖僅設雙門，但出入極便：雖高大之身材，亦未見其有任何困難。自主前輪具有標準彈簧，車輛軍心下垂，敷以柔和之鋼板，佐以堅强之塞車，與强有力之吸震器，車輛行駛時之穩捷，安全，舒適，殆巳臻於登峯造極之境，至於經久耐用，本為蘭腦汽車特殊之優點，而一九三九蓓蓓蘭腦「秀華」，允為出色云。</p>
<p>經濟　蘭腦汽車不僅以汽油之節省，稱雄於時，而節制機件磨擦之動作，允著於世。本年度所出之蓓蓓蘭腦「秀華」，雖行駛在極高速率之時，引擎旋轉决數之溫和，仍屬僅無絕有，引擎中主要機件，如汽簡，搪柱，及活塞等之動作，，亦因是而隨之减少，於是車輛服務時期得以延長，而每年耗於修理之費用，自亦隨之而大為减少。聞本月六日又有大批新車到滬，經售商為露飛路法商法大汽車公司云。</p>

<p>法院取消，而於四月一日成立江蘇上海特區地方法院及江蘇高等法院第二分院與民國二十年七月二十八日，中國政府。法國簽訂法租界內中國法院協定四條附件七條，隨卽依據協定，在法租界設立江蘇上海第二特區地方法院曁江蘇高等法院第三分院各一所。</p>
<p>附録　地皮章程</p>
<p>地皮章程（Land　Regulation）最初係在清道光二十五年滬道宮慕久所公佈，計二十三款，後又增加一款，咸豐四年改訂一次，同治八年又加修改，章程共二十九款及附律四十二條，中國文譯稱：「上海洋涇浜北首租界章程」及「上海洋涇浜北首西國租界田地章程後附規例」。光緒間又加修改，如華董之增設等則未加入章程中，章程附刋於次，以備參考：後附規則從略。</p>
<p>一　上海洋涇浜北首租界章程　清光緒中訂</p>
<p>第一款　定立地方界限</p>
<p>租界地方界限，經兩江總督劉所派之委員曁上海縣會同西　一千八百九十九年份工部局首董商訂推廣，詳細議定，豎立界石，繪圖列說，以憑遵照，今將其界限，開列於後：</p>
<p>北　蘇州河即吳淞江　自小沙渡至接連泥城浜處之西約七十碼地方，由此處朝北到寶山上海兩縣之西約七十碼地方，由此處朝北到寶山上海兩縣之界綫，由此界綫一直至相連虹口港地方，由此處朝東給顧家浜口。</p>
<p>東　黃浦江　自顧家浜口至洋涇浜口。</p>
<p>南　洋涇浜　自洋涇浜口至接連泥城浜處，由此處向西南大西路沿長浜之北首枝路，並向此枝路直達靜安寺鎮後面之五聖廟。</p>
<p>西　自五聖廟一直朝北至蘇州河小沙渡地方。</p>
<p>第二款　租地之法</p>
<p>凡在所定租界限內，有人欲向中國原業戶租用基地，置買房屋產業，必須遵照中國與各國所立約章條款辦理。</p>
<p>第三款　租地應辦事宜如何方為完善及立</p>
<p>契之法</p>
<p>其永遠租地之事，如查無關碍，方准願承租者與中國原業戶商定價值等事，稟明該管領事官，在署中呈出中國原業戶所寫永遠出租契據二紙，係屬一式，繪圖一紙，畫出地形，詳載四址，領事官即據以轉送上海道衙門，以備查考，查明所租之地事，俱　當無碍，即由道習加蓋印信，移還給執，該地價值，即可照數付清，若所租基地內，有墳墓厝柩等情，或遷葬或搬　，必須臨時商辦，因中國例，此等情節，不寫入永租契據之內故也。</p>
<p>第四款　租地須掛號入册即與押亦須報明入册</p>
<p>凡遵照以上例章置業，立契事竣之後，限一年內由該租主持該管領事官衙門內報明入册掛號，以後，如有典押各情，亦須於一月內，赴該管官署報明入册備考。</p>
<p>地產局得領事團之核准，一千九百年成立管理租界領事館注册之地產事宜，現行章程如下。</p>
<p>如遇聲請注册時經領事察閱所遞呈稟，知照滬海道道尹，俟道伊批回丈量日期，立即通知地產局及當事人，地產局即派委員一人會同丈量。</p>
<p>領事館接到道契及地圖後，即照樣繪地圖一紙，送交地產局限七日批回領事館經過七日可將道契發出。</p>
<p>地產局如對於地主面積　界墳墓及路權等有意見時，當於發回地圖　　明，經領事核准即再知照道尹，惟所提出之意見，如領事不以為然，道契可即發出，不至遲延。</p>
<p>此時領事當以一種記載書送達原聲請人，其中載明須遵照地產章程第七條辦理等語，同時更以一種記載書送地產局，載明道契發給情形，如遇契載之主權面積分界等項有所更動時，宜以同樣之記載書，一一載明。</p>
<p>地圖送回時，地產局當聲明注册號數，以便注入道契。</p>
<p>按照一千九百零四年之補助編制地產局發出一種證明界石已立定之證書後，道契始得决定。</p>
<p>第五款　轉契亦須掛號</p>
<p>凡轉租基地，須在該契掛號之領事衙門內呈明，其得主亦須赴該管領事衙門呈請掛號，並由領事官通知公局（即工部局）。</p>
<p>第六款　讓出公用之地</p>
<p>凡在租界以內，已經執業租主各西人讓出作公用之地（如道路漲灘之類），嗣後仍照前遵行，專作公用，不得另行別用，即將來置買新地內，如有漲灘，亦必憑照此章，讓作公用，以資執業，因須預籌推廣開築租界通行往來之路，由公局於西　每年新正查勘地圖，將應作新開馬路處所，公同會議擬定，（公局係租界之內執業租主及有關准議事之西人照章公同會程，均見於後，）凡遇此後轉租之事，基地內如有續漲灘地及應開作道路之地，必由承租者照章讓作公用，以便執業，（此章係議定衆所共知自應遵照之租地執業章程）此項照章讓出及已作公用之地，及齊集各執業租主有　人等共同會議核定允准，將該地給還原主收回之外，不能由原主自行任意收回，至此項已經讓出作為公用之地，尚有應完年租，雖仍由原主照繳，但不能藉此希圖管業，除照上載各項外，如有佔用漲灘馬路等地，作為公用情事，必先經該執業租主應允，方可施行，决不能以援引此章為詞，各執業租主會同　議，將地段劃歸公局管轄之後，公局即將擬在該地方作公用公路等處，出示通知，倘有早在該地方置有產業之有約各國商民等，因公局示內所云公用公路之處，有所辯論，限十四天內投該管領事官，具呈稟明，或自己專函通知公局，以便設法調處，若照領事官意見，未能妥協，即任聽公局將管轄該地方之責推辭，此事即為罷論，租界內執業租主，（有　議事人亦在內）之地，以便編成街路及建造公花園為大衆游玩怡性適情之處，所有購買建造，與常年修理等費，准由公局在第九款抽收捐項內隨時支付，但此等街路花園專作公用，與租界以內居住之人同沾利益，合行聲明。</p>

<p>第七款　立分界石碑</p>
<p>凡租地四至，必經（中國官員該管領事）督率辦理，豎立分界石碑，將編成號數，用（英漢）文字合寫刋刻，明白確實，預訂日期，屆時由該管領事官，派人傳同執業租主，亭　地保，原業戶等偕往，查與道路界限，均無違碍，方准將分界石碑豎立，以免將來因此爭論，致啟訟端。</p>
<p>第八款　限期完納年租</p>
<p>凡中國業戶租與西人之地，尚存有應完年租，限於每年十二月十五日，預將明年地租全行照完，如有遲延及抗欠等情，即由上海道函致該管領事官，向執業之西人追繳。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Strengthening the Anti-Japanese War Effort: Chinese Troops Re-Equipped and Deployed, Ready to Take the Initiative; Situation Stabilized North of the Xiang River; Chinese Forces Highly Active on the Eastern Guangdong Front, Shìlóng Likely to Fall <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The military situation on the border of Hunan and Hubei remains calm. In the past month and a half, the Chinese army has greatly improved its military and political capabilities, doubling its strength and morale. Now, the battle order has been rearranged, and the troop movements and deployments of the past week have been fully completed. In the future, they will shift to an active stance, not only controlling Yuèyáng but also threatening Wǔchāng and Jiǔjiāng. The situation north of the Xiang River is favorable to China. As of the 31st, the military situation on the various fronts in southern China indicates that the Chinese army on the northern front is focusing its attacks on Japanese strongholds along the Yuèhàn Railway. It has already crossed Cónghuà and launched a southward offensive. The Chinese army is most active on the eastern front, and Shìlóng may fall soon. The Japanese army has suffered repeated defeats on the western front. Originally, it intended to invade Wúzhōu, but its strength is now insufficient to reach Zhàoqìng. The southern front is quiet. (Special dispatch at 5:00 PM on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Chángshā) There have been no drastic changes in the war situation on the border of Hunan and Hubei at the end of the year. Chinese and Japanese forces are still facing each other from the banks of the Dòngtíng River in the west, across the northern bank of the Xīnqiáng River, to the Jiǔlǐng Mountains in the east. The scope of the war has never exceeded 30 miles from the suburbs of Yuèyáng and Tōngchéng. Observers believe that, for convenience, the Japanese army may launch a southward offensive along the Hunan-Hubei highway. In terms of results, the Japanese army seems to be focusing on the Dòngtíng Lake area and the northern section of the Yuèhàn Railway. However, the Jiǔlǐng Mountains are steep and rugged, the water level of Dòngtíng Lake is low in winter, making navigation difficult, and the two railway bridges at Púqí and Nánjīngǎng in the northern section of the Yuèhàn Railway have been thoroughly destroyed by the Chinese army, requiring extensive engineering work and making it difficult to repair them in the short term. All these factors make it impossible for the Japanese army to advance south. Furthermore, a powerful Chinese guerrilla force operates behind the Japanese lines, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, constantly restraining the Japanese army and preventing them from advancing south. Currently, the Japanese forces in the Yuèyáng and Tōngchéng areas are still the 9th and 20th Divisions, along with some puppet troops. Their morale is low, and discipline is lax. After the commander-in-chief of the Chinese army personally inspected and deployed the troops at the front, the will to fight has been strengthened. A new change will occur in the future war situation. (Dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>Guìlín: Since the beginning of the second phase of the war of resistance, Chinese troops have been able to launch bloody counterattacks, fiercely striking the Japanese. According to a military expert here, the Japanese are in a precarious situation in Guǎngzhōu because the Chinese army in northern Guangdong is approaching the suburbs of Huaxian County, and more than two Japanese regiments have been annihilated by the Chinese army in the lower reaches of the West River. Furthermore, the Japanese army in Yuèyáng, north of the Xiang River, has also been defeated by the Chinese army and is showing signs of retreating. Therefore, from the perspective of the overall war situation in the southwest, it can be asserted that the Japanese forces are exhausted and on the verge of falling into a quagmire. The current war situation seems relatively calm, but this is not a standstill. The Japanese army is still actively plotting and arranging its attempts to invade from western Guangdong, advance from northern Guangdong, and advance south from Yuèyáng. Furthermore, whenever the Japanese are planning an invasion or reorganizing their troops, they always use vile diplomatic propaganda, claiming things like "peace" as a habitual trick. This is truly a ridiculous and shameless act of deceiving the world. In short, the Chinese army has become stronger and stronger in recent battles, and all the Japanese attempts will eventually become a dream. (Dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Traffic on the Guangdong-South highway was completely cut off from New Year's Day. Zhāng Fākuí convened a security meeting in Qǔjiāng and decided to develop transportation in the rear, limiting the completion of the Guangdong-Guangxi western section of the highway to three months.

<p>Japanese Troops in Shìlóng Surrounded</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to news received here, there was still fierce street fighting in Zēngchéng last night because a remnant of the Japanese army was stubbornly resisting with solid fortifications. It is expected that they will be wiped out by the Chinese army this morning. There is fierce fighting in Shìlóng, and the Chinese army is now advancing in three directions, taking a large encirclement strategy against the Japanese troops in Shìlóng. The Japanese troops on the West River are still watching and not advancing due to the defeats in the northeastern and western West River battles. (Quick News Agency dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Shell Area Near Yángjiāng</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Three Japanese warships shelled the area near Yángjiāng in southern Guangdong Province again yesterday afternoon, attempting to cover the landing of Japanese troops at Dàgòu (transliteration). However, they were bravely repelled by the Chinese defense forces. Judging from the recent actions of the Japanese army, it does not seem to have the ability to launch a large-scale invasion of Guì Province. Currently, there are still six Japanese warships and two transport ships anchored outside the port of Běihǎi. (Quick News Agency dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>Guangdong Provincial Government to Move to Sháoguān</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangdong Provincial Government has decided to move from Liánxiàn to Sháoguān and is now making all the arrangements.

<p>Zhānggōngdù: Since the Japanese army was defeated on the northern bank of Zhānggōngdù on the 28th, the fighting along the Xiū River has been quiet for several days. Both sides are shooting at each other across the river with rifles, and artillery fire is also sparse. However, Chinese guerrillas on the northern bank are still very active.

A newly arrived Japanese regiment in Tiándiàn, along with a small number of Japanese troops in Yìngshān, Tiǎoshuǐhé, Hújiāchōng, and Guānhépù, retreated to Zhèhé after being cleared. Japanese troops in Gōngzhìzhèn and Guāndìmiao retreated to Yìngshān. Three to four hundred Japanese troops in Fángchìpù, Yóushān, and Jiǎngjiāgǎng.

<p>Tóngguān: At 7:00 AM on the 29th, the artillery shells fired by the Japanese troops in Zhāngdiànzhèn towards Wángjiāhuá were mostly poison gas shells. More than ten Chinese soldiers were poisoned. Then, over a hundred infantry soldiers, with two cannons, attacked the Chinese Sùjiāwān position. The Chinese army counterattacked, and the Japanese troops were defeated and retreated around 10:00 AM. The remaining Japanese troops fled back to Zhāngdiànzhèn. (Dispatch on the 31st)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Since the Japanese blockaded the Yangtze River, foreign shipping companies have suffered great losses. However, since the blockades in the lower reaches are still controlled by Chinese guerrillas, foreign ships can still travel back and forth.

<p>(Hong Kong) According to sources from foreigners in Nánjīng, the situation in Nánjīng has been quite tense recently. Chinese guerrilla forces have been discovered in the Yǔhuātái area in the southern suburbs. Their outposts have often advanced to the south gate and chatted with the puppet police standing guard at the city gate, acting naturally. Now the Japanese army dares not leave the city even a step. The Chinese Air Force also occasionally flies to Nánjīng for reconnaissance and bombing. At dawn on the 30th, several planes dropped four bombs on a Japanese gathering place, all of which exploded. It is said that many Japanese soldiers were killed and wounded. (Dispatch on the 31st)</p>

<h3 id="e15">New Year's Message <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Today marks the New Year's Day of the 28th year of the Republic of China, which is the beginning of the year 1939 in the Gregorian calendar. Today is no different from yesterday, just as tomorrow will be no different from today. The earth revolves, with day and night, cold and heat, while the universe is vast, with no beginning and no end. As for establishing years and months, and regarding this day as New Year's Day, it is an ancient human custom, creating a discipline that has lasted for thousands of years, with countless applications. The decadent lament the passing of time, becoming aware of the gradual approach of old age. The ambitious renovate the old and bring forth the new, striving for strength and constant progress. All things come to life, sprouting with the new year.</p>
<p>On this auspicious occasion, there are countless things we want to pray for and endless things we want to encourage. To highlight the major points: The prediction of a second world war in 1937 and 1938 has been proven by facts to be fortunately unfulfilled. However, in the past year, following the previous year, China and Japan, engaged in a war of self-defense and aggression, extended the battle lines to 3,500 kilometers. Spain, as a testing ground for international warfare, accounted for two-thirds of its territory. The price that Czechoslovakia paid to avoid war was one-third of its territory. Abyssinia ultimately became a sacrifice for European appeasement, its demise sanctioned by an international treaty. In addition, pending issues include the Nine-Power Treaty, which has reached a critical juncture, Europe, with Ukraine as a new powder keg, Africa, with French territories coveted by Italy, and the Soviet-Japanese fishery agreement, which expired yesterday with no renewal. All these are important international "outstanding accounts" at the end of last year. Therefore, the fact that the great war did not materialize as predicted is due to the extension and evolution of the crisis, not its fundamental elimination. Since the crisis does not disappear with the passing of time, how should the path of appeasement keep pace with the times? Without appeasement, it is easy to imagine that this year will not be one of leisure and peace, a fact that cannot be concealed.</p>
<p>How to achieve appeasement? Contemporary politicians often regard compromise with reality as the secret to appeasement. However, the god of war is not satisfied with Czechoslavakia, and the reality at the end of last year was no better than the reality at the beginning of last year, which has frankly answered the question of compromise. Furthermore, the military spending in the national budgets set by various countries this year has almost exceeded all previous records, which serves as counter-evidence that appeasement has not been successful. British Prime Minister Chamberlain, in his New Year's speech, expressed his determination not to yield to force. The international situation after appeasement remains serious, which can be seen from the words of this old man. If not compromise, then what? Contemporary commentators often say that only democratic countries can unite. From the perspective of international divisions, those who stir up trouble and engage in militarism are all non-democratic countries. To maintain peace and counter them, the unity of non-democratic countries is not enough. In light of this distinction, we not only agree with this view but should also create a strong world public opinion to promote the success of unity. However, from a more accurate perspective, whether a country's government is democratic or authoritarian, fascist or communist, each can practice its own beliefs, what does it have to do with international affairs? Although dictatorships and fascist regimes inherently contain strong militaristic elements, and seem inseparable from acts of aggression, what we should oppose is aggression, regardless of whether it is dictatorship or fascism. In other words, uniting to resist aggression, why must it be under the banner of democracy! Rather than using democracy as a banner to highlight the shortcomings of dictatorships, the ideological division becomes a handle for political theories, and there will be no definitive conclusion on right and wrong. Instead, we should make a further recognition and determine that the conflict of the present era is between those who maintain the original good order of the international community and those who advocate a new order to destroy the old, whether in Europe, Africa, or Asia.</p>
<p>Examining the past year, both Europe and Africa have undergone compromise and slightly changed their original state, what good has that done? Asia has been at war for years for the so-called new order, without restoring the original state, how to end the conflict? If the phenomena of last year are allowed to continue, those aggressors will inevitably collude further, forming military alliances and taking further actions to disrupt the order. Then, no matter how one prays for peace and prosperity at the beginning of the year, all will be reduced to illusions. Peace and prosperity must be built on order, in the family, in the hometown, and in the international community. Therefore, what the international community should encourage this year is nothing else but cherishing order for the sake of peace and prosperity, and preventing those who disrupt order for the sake of respecting order.</p>

<p>Generalissimo Chiang's Instructions</p>
<p>The following is a record of Generalissimo Chiang's instructions: Fellow countrymen, today is New Year's Eve of the 27th year of the Republic of China, and tomorrow will be the beginning of the 28th year. According to social customs, everyone is always excited and proactive in the New Year, going their separate ways to seek entertainment. We have been resisting the enemy for a full year and a half today, and the military and civilians across the country are living in extreme hardship and danger, especially the compatriots in the occupied areas, who are suffering endless destruction and poison from the enemy. During this period, we should be enduring hardship and making efforts to strengthen ourselves. We should not be talking about entertainment. However, we must resist to the end and achieve complete victory. We must have all the people of the country "boost their morale" and "strengthen national power." All reasonable and beneficial entertainment that is suitable for this condition should not only not be prohibited but should also be actively promoted. Therefore, the topic I want to talk about today is "Promoting proper entertainment and boosting national spirit." The purpose of my initial promotion of the New Life Movement was, on the one hand, to see the danger in the country's environment, and on the other hand, to witness the excessive corruption and頹弛, disorder, and disorganization in the public and private lives of the general public, which were not enough to cope with extraordinary events. Therefore, I formulated several articles to teach people how to live in accordance with military, production, and artistic principles as the highest standards, and to express etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame in their food, clothing, housing, and transportation as practical methods. Since its implementation, although it has not yet reached our ideal level, it has indeed seen great results. (To be continued) (Dispatch on the 31st)</p>

<h3 id="e20">After Wang Jingwei Advocated Peace Talks, All Parties Unanimously and Severely Condemned Him. It Is Reported That Zhu Will Go to Guangzhou Within Days to Organize a Puppet Government. He Xiangning Advocated Expelling Wang from the Party. Councilor Zhang Yilin and Others Requested the Removal of Wang from All Positions. <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to a local Chinese-language evening newspaper, Zhu Jingwei will go to Guangzhou within days to organize a puppet government. It is also said that the Japanese army will retreat to Humen. The truth of this remains to be verified. In other news, Wang once had contact with a certain party, and several Central Committee members sent by him have already left Chongqing. The central government is about to decide on measures and express its attitude. The Fifth Plenary Session will also be held immediately. (1 a.m. special dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) He Xiangning wrote an article that will be sent to various newspapers tonight, entitled "Reprimanding Wang Zhaoming," stating: First, it proves that the pro-peace faction has ulterior motives, and Wang is no different from an enemy mouthpiece. Second, his departure after his plan failed proves the government's firm determination to resist Japan and the great progress made by all parties. The future of the War of Resistance is bright. Finally, she advised the Central Committee members staying in Hong Kong and Macau: 1. Do not be tempted by his enticements and support Chairman Chiang's resistance against Japan. 2. Jointly sign to expel him from the party. Councilors Zhang Yilin, Hu Jingyi, and Tao Xingzhi telegraphed Lin and Chiang on the 31st, requesting the removal of Wang from all positions and ordering him to return to Chongqing to reassure the people and correct public opinion. Various Hong Kong legal groups will also make statements. (Special dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Zhu Jingwei currently resides in Chen Shuren's house near Kowloon City, avoiding visitors. It is reported that Zhu originally intended to go to France, but his entry visa to Annam (French Indochina) has been revoked by the authorities upon notification from the authorities, so it is difficult to go to France. It is said that he made absurd suggestions to the central government, which was due to the lobbying of a certain party. Hong Kong newspapers mostly criticized Wang's telegram. (Special dispatch at 5 p.m. on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to reliable sources, Wang Jingwei did arrive at a certain place near Hong Kong last night. After Wang issued a telegram last night advocating peace and surrender, all sectors of the Chinese community here were deeply indignant, believing that he was willing to make this "peace proposal" out of a loss of conscience and a self-imposed break with the nation. However, it is noted that this article is purely a personal fallacy. Chairman Chiang had already stated that Wang's future speeches had nothing to do with the central government or the national government. Therefore, not only will the central government not consider this telegram, but China's national policy of resisting Japan to the end will not be affected in the slightest. (Quick News Agency dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) This morning, Chinese-language newspapers here all condemned Zhu Jingwei's actions, because he had telegraphed Chairman Chiang yesterday, advocating signing peace terms with Japan. Many people here believe that Wang Jingwei's telegram was instructed by a certain party, hoping to stop the war in China. It is heard that the Kuomintang will soon convene the Fifth Plenary Session to discuss this situation. After the meeting, the government will definitely make a strong statement to declare the position of China and its people that there is absolutely no intention of signing a peace treaty. (Quick News Agency dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Today, Chinese people unanimously condemned the declaration issued by Zhu Jingwei last night. According to Chinese newspapers, Japan's peace terms were given to the Chinese government by Wang before Japanese Prime Minister Konoe publicly announced them on December 32nd. Sing Tao Daily commented that Wang Jingwei gave the Japanese Prime Minister Konoe the Japanese peace terms to the Chinese government, and it is reported that he left Chongqing four days before the Japanese Prime Minister publicly announced them. As for what Wang stated in his declaration, that Japan did not make demands for land or reparations from China, the Overseas Chinese Daily commented that Japan has no right to demand compensation for military expenses from China, and this point should be raised by China. The newspaper also pointed out that the Japanese army's occupation of "Manchukuo" is unreliable proof that the Japanese side has promised not to demand land. The newspaper further stated that communism is an internal problem of China, and Japan has no right to interfere. As for the so-called economic cooperation, it is a euphemism for economic aggression. (United Press dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A Reuters reporter learned from responsible sources that Chairman Chiang has not yet received the telegram from Zhu Jingwei advocating peace talks with Japan based on Konoe's (1) freedom of residence and business for Japanese in China, (2) anti-communism, and (3) Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. (Reuters dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, the newspapers here published Zhu Jingwei's telegram seeking peace in large characters. The cabinet also held a meeting to discuss how to deal with the development of the situation in China and strengthen the cabinet. People here believe that Zhu Jingwei's telegram is a preliminary action to seek peace. It is still unknown whether there will be further developments. Therefore, the Japanese side must proceed cautiously and not be overly optimistic. (Associated Press dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the matter of Wang Jingwei, an important figure in the Chinese Kuomintang, advocating peace talks with Japan, the Petit Parisien newspaper here recently published a telegram from its Shanghai correspondent, stating that the Chinese government may declare Wang Jingwei an outlaw. "Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is supported by the people and has at least one million well-equipped troops and will continue to resist Japan as before. Important battles in the future will be fought in mountainous areas, where the Japanese motorized units will have difficulty maneuvering freely. Wang Jingwei's actions, if supported by government officials and generals, may be important to some extent. But judging from the attitude of the Chinese government, Wang's actions are a personal initiative. He himself and his followers are isolated and dissatisfied with the government." (Havas dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) An airmail letter from the most reliable sources in Chongqing described the circumstances of Zhu Jingwei's escape in great detail. It is said that Wang had long been inciting the military leaders of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces to join his group, but Chairman Chiang was determined to continue the war of resistance and inspected new bases in Xi'an and Lanzhou, so Wang's plan failed. Later, news of Wang's activities leaked out, and Wang's followers passed letters to each other, saying, "Wang is in trouble, we must find a way to rescue him from Chongqing." As a result, Peng Xuepei, the director of Wang's Ministry of Transportation, prepared a plane to help Wang escape. However, Peng Xuepei was arrested for this. Wang's escape was not known to Chairman Chiang in advance. Wang tried to entice Long Yun, the chairman of Yunnan Province, to join his group, but Long Yun refused and immediately reported the matter to Chairman Chiang, so Wang had no choice but to escape. His followers Chen Gongbo, Zhou Fohai, Zeng Zhongming, and others followed him. It is also learned that Prime Minister Konoe's declaration was secretly sent to Wang for review before its public announcement, seeking his approval. When the Japanese side learned of Wang's escape, they felt extremely annoyed, believing that Wang had left too early. If Wang had stayed in Chongqing, he might have gained possible supporters when the Kuomintang meeting decided. Wang's decision to escape shows that he can no longer gain supporters in the country. Therefore, his agents are now trying to recruit overseas veteran Kuomintang members. It is also learned that Wang has contacts with the subordinates of Wu Peifu in Beiping. This decision by Wang to escape actually destroyed his value to the Japanese side, because he could not entice Yunnan's support and cut off China's transportation lines. It is also learned that the Japanese side intends to push Wang to organize a puppet government in the southwest. According to this kind of incident, it is always presided over by the Japanese army. This time, it is actually presided over by the navy, because this area is the sphere of influence of the navy. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 31st)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) According to Chinese sources, passenger and freight transportation on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway suddenly stopped yesterday. This may be related to the movement of Japanese troops.

<p>(Washington) The State Department announced today that Ambassador Grew has sent a new note to the Japanese government. It is heard that this note strongly opposes Japan's efforts to establish a new order in China. Japan informed the United States in a note on November 18th that Japan believes that the principles of the Open Door and Equal Opportunity in China have become outdated and unsuitable. Therefore, the United States issued this new note in response. It is heard that the United States refutes Japan's claim that the treaties to which the United States is a signatory have been violated, and declares that the only way to amend the treaties is through international agreement. This note explains the United States' basic position on Japan, and its wording is firm and is a final statement. (Reuters dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, the United States suggested to Japan that an international conference be convened to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute and informed the Japanese government that Washington was not satisfied with Japan's response to the United States' strong protest on October 6. This latest American note was handed to the Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister because Foreign Minister Arita was away at the time. The note pointed out that Japan had previously promised to abide by the various provisions concerning the Far East. The note frankly reiterated the United States' respect for the dignity of the treaties and that it would give them its traditional support. The note continued, stating that the United States is well aware that the situation in the Far East has changed, but it cannot sympathize with the unilateral solution to the China problem. In view of the fact that international conferences have been held in the past to resolve Far East disputes, if Japan agrees, the United States is still willing to engage in new international consultations. This note was transferred to the Japanese Foreign Ministry by US Ambassador to Japan Grew. At the end of this week, Mr. Grew protested to the authorities that the Japanese government had repeatedly failed to give the US a satisfactory response to its protests.

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita and Navy Minister Mitsumasa Yonai today issued New Year's messages to the nation here, saying that Japan intends to eradicate the "erroneous notion that the East is a colony of Western powers and that Westerners can develop it at will," and therefore it is necessary to guarantee its dominance in the Western Pacific. Arita declared, "Japan has always sought to eradicate the old notion that the East is a colony of Western capitalist countries." While praising Germany and Italy for their friendly attitude towards Japan, Arita condemned other foreign countries. The Foreign Minister said, "Only Germany and Italy can deeply understand the situation in East Asia. Other countries mostly disregard the situation in the East and often make unreasonable demands. Therefore, it is currently necessary to correct this kind of misunderstanding." Yonai said that the help of third countries to Chiang Kai-shek of China is nothing more than expressing their hostile attitude towards Japan and obviously has the intention of interfering with Japan's construction plans in China, and even hinted that military intervention is also possible. "We believe that it is currently possible to build in China under military protection.

<p>Guilin: From the 30th of last month to the 29th of this month, Japanese aircraft bombed the urban area of Guilin several times. Although the number of deaths is not as high as in Guangzhou and Changsha, the extent of the disaster area and the amount of loss are the highest in all places since the War of Resistance. In total, no less than 3,000 houses in the city were destroyed, accounting for more than two-fifths of the city's buildings. Except for Guidong Road and Zhongnan Road, which still exist, Tongqu Road, Zhongbei Road, Guixi Road, and Guinan Road were all reduced to ashes. Among the losses of foreign property, there are the Gospel Church and the Catholic Church on Guinan Road, and the well-equipped Baptist Seminary Hospital was also completely burned down yesterday, with only the outer walls remaining. Among the religious buildings destroyed, four of the seven mosques of the Hui people were destroyed. Among the cultural institutions destroyed, there are the National Defense Art Society, the China Vocational Education Society, and more than ten primary and secondary schools. More than 500 civilians have been injured in total, and there are more than 10,000 homeless people. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is mindful of the victims and plans to allocate 50,000 yuan for relief. The Guizhou Provincial Government is also doing its best to provide relief and has designated several places outside the city to build sheds to accommodate refugees. The only ones who are suffering are the compatriots who have come to Guilin from other provinces after many twists and turns. Having suffered this disaster, they have no choice but to stand on the streets, trying to sell their last items of clothing. The city has been hit by nearly a thousand bombs, but the city's appearance still maintains a neat and solemn atmosphere. The brutality of the Japanese can turn Guilin into ruins, but the morale of the people of Guilin is competing with the flames of the Japanese incendiary bombs rising into the sky. (Dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>Guilin: The fire caused by the incendiary bombs dropped by Japanese aircraft here yesterday afternoon gradually subsided at 2:00 a.m. this morning. According to officials, the number of houses destroyed is indeed around 1,800, with 21 civilians dead and 13 injured. Among the dead, 12 people died together in an air-raid shelter on Zhuye Street. One corner of the shelter was hit by a bomb, but the shelter was unharmed, and all the people were shaken to death. A reporter from the Central News Agency toured the disaster area for a week this afternoon. In the Nancheng area, there are still embers that have not been extinguished. From a few dozen steps south of the Niefan Bridge in Nancheng to the city gate, east and west to the foot of the city, the houses within a radius of four square miles have all become scorched earth. Even if one or two houses remain, they are all with walls pierced and roofs broken. The houses have almost become ruins. There were originally about 300 houses in Techali, but not a single tile remains. The fire was the fiercest there. The houses under Elephant Trunk Hill were also burned, even though they were separated by a river. The fire spread widely in Guixi Road and Zhongbei Road. Zhongbei Road was completely burned from Qianzi Street to Yinju. About 100 houses were destroyed in the middle section of Guixi Road. In addition, the houses bombed and burned on Lequn Road, Taiping Road, Rongcheng Road, and East Huanhu Road are all eye-catching. In addition, the power plant was bombed and destroyed, and the entire city was dark last night. Only the raging fire in Nancheng illuminated half of the sky, making people feel even more painful and angry when they looked at it. (Dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>Changde: Multiple Japanese aircraft bombed various locations in Hanshou, Changde, and Taoyuan counties today, causing extremely heavy losses. At 11:20 a.m., three Japanese aircraft were spotted over Jiangxian County, flying west. At 11:30 a.m., one aircraft flew into Changde County, circling and reconnoitering in the suburbs for a long time before escaping along the same route. In the Yuanjiang area, another nine Japanese bombers were spotted flying west. At 2:40 p.m., 22 Japanese aircraft were spotted in Xiejiapu, east of Changde, attacking in three batches. One batch of nine aircraft sneaked into the sky over Changde City at 2:44 p.m., dropping hundreds of light and heavy bombs and incendiary bombs inside and outside the city. They circled for about half an hour before escaping to the northeast. Another batch of seven aircraft invaded Taoyuan County City at 3:00 p.m., dropping bombs and also flying to the northeast. Another batch of six aircraft flew to Hanshou County at the same time and rampaged, and then escaped along the same route. After the Japanese aircraft flew away, the reporter went to various places that had been bombed to inspect. Starting from the southwest gate of Changde to Sugongdi outside the east gate, many bombs fell along the streets on the north bank of the Yuanjiang River, with the area around Shixiangkou Tiechuan Temple being the most tragic. Broken walls and ruins are everywhere. The compatriots who were killed or injured were either lying stiffly on the streets or moaning by the roadside. There were also those with flesh and blood flying everywhere, and incomplete limbs. The tragedy was too horrible to witness. The roof of the Catholic Church on Shuifumiaojie by the river, although prominently displaying the French flag, was also hit by a bomb in the courtyard. Many bombs fell in the front and back Xinglong Street, West Wall, Zhuzhuwei, Zhaolou Street, Paoping, Chidigong, Chenghuang Temple, Dahe Street, Baizian, East Zhongshan Road, Dagao Mountain Lane, Hanshou Street, Fuping Street, Menggu Fourth Lane, and Yaowanggong in the city. Some of the buildings of the Police Department, Police Bureau, and Post Office were destroyed. This decision by the Japanese aircraft to indiscriminately bomb inside and outside Changde City without a target resulted in a total of 37 houses being destroyed and over 700 houses being damaged in various streets. Many civilian ships in the river were bombed and burned. 106 residents died, and more than 200 were injured. The people's property losses were incalculable. The disaster situation was more tragic than last month. In addition to rushing to bury the dead, the authorities are also investigating the losses of the people in detail and trying to provide relief. Taoyuan County was hit by more than 50 bombs, and many places on the east-west main streets in the city were destroyed. The county government and prison were also bombed, and more than 200 civilians were killed or injured. Hanshou County was hit by more than 30 bombs and incendiary bombs. Several fires broke out on Zheng Street in the north gate, burning dozens of houses. Several bombs fell on the county government, which was completely destroyed.

<p>(Xi'an) On the afternoon of the 26th, more than ten Japanese aircraft rampaged in Daxian and Ningji counties in western Shanxi. The Ningji County Government was destroyed by bombing.

This time, it was rampaged again by nine Japanese aircraft, which dropped more than 30 bombs, killing or injuring 13 people. The young philosopher Wen Jiangong was also unfortunately killed. Wen was from Meixian, Guangdong. At the age of 32, he taught at various universities in Beiping. Before his death, he translated and wrote a lot.

<p>(Berlin) Following US Secretary of the Interior Ickes's speech attacking Germany before Christmas, and the State Department's attitude towards the matter, the German semi-official news agency published an article yesterday responding. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>US Secretary of the Interior Ickes's speech to the Zionist Congress in Cleveland before Christmas, attacking the leadership of the Third Reich in an extraordinary manner, led to a sharp protest from the German Chargé d'Affaires in Washington to the US Undersecretary of State. The State Department did not follow international precedent by clarifying that the US Secretary of the Interior's remarks were unrelated to the government, but instead defended them. As long as such an event exists in US-German relations, the US State Department's stated desire to improve mutual relations lacks foundation, as it favors Jewish interests and ignores the interests between the US and Germany. (31st Hai Tong Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers yesterday carried articles based on official instructions, stating that since the US is swayed by forces protecting Jewish interests, there is no hope for improving US-German relations. The German protest against US Secretary of the Interior Ickes's anti-fascist remarks made on December 18th, and the US State Department's rejection of this protest, were only disclosed by German newspapers yesterday. After the aforementioned articles based on official instructions were published, German newspapers were clearly ordered to launch a major attack against the US again. The National Socialist Party's organ, the "People's Observer," carried an editorial today stating that the US State Department actually considers Ickes's abhorrent remarks fair. The development of US-German relations under the current regime in Washington can be seen from this. The failure of the Secret Conference may be the reason for the US to vent its anger on Germany, as the US seems to be using a tactic to shift its own faults onto Germany. The US government clearly wants to create tension in US-German relations when Congress convenes, in order to justify to the American people the need for large-scale rearmament. The newspaper also said that if the US does not adopt an idealistically stubborn commercial policy, Germany could easily purchase three to four million bales of American cotton annually. The newspaper then recalled President Roosevelt's telegram to Hitler during the tense situation in August, in which the US President called on Hitler to resolve the issue peacefully, stating that billions of people would consider peaceful resolution to be the noblest and most historically valuable contribution to mankind. Roosevelt has now forgotten his words and is listening to those around him, such as Hull, Ickes, and Pittman, to do as they please. The opinions of other German newspapers are similar to this. (31st Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) German newspapers yesterday began attacking the US again. Some say that US-German relations may break down because of this, but well-informed sources here do not believe this to be the case, saying that the German anti-American propaganda was temporarily suspended for a week because it did not want to disrupt the Christmas season in both the US and Germany. (31st Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) US State Department personnel today refused to comment on the statements regarding US-German relations published in German newspapers yesterday under official instructions. However, well-informed circles believe that these statements have brought US-German relations closer to a complete stalemate. (31st Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(New York) Regarding Secretary of the Interior Ickes's attack on Germany's anti-Jewish movement, the German semi-official organization, the German News Agency, only issued a message as late as yesterday, announcing that the US government refused to accept the German protest. American political figures, upon hearing this, all commented with sarcasm. They do not understand why the German authorities insist that the US has the same interests as the Jews, but they believe that American newspapers will not re-engage in a war of words with German newspapers. From a diplomatic perspective, this dispute has already ended after Acting Secretary of State Welles refused to accept the German protest. (30th Havas Telegraph)</p>

<p>(Berlin) In his New Year's message to the German people, German leader Hitler mentioned three urgent tasks to be fulfilled: first, to instill the National Socialist Party ideology in the general population; second, to build and strengthen military power; and third, to complete the Four-Year Plan to solve the labor shortage, promising renewed economic cooperation in German territory. The message also mentioned Germany's relations with other countries. In terms of foreign policy, the territories already occupied by Germany have been clearly stated, and friendship with Fascist Italy has been openly acknowledged and is sacred and inviolable. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's efforts to maintain peace can be found in historical records and are clearly evident, for which we are endlessly grateful. We are also grateful to the politicians who participated in seeking a peace plan that cannot be delayed this year. Our only hope is to seek international tranquility, and we deeply hope that we can contribute to this work in the coming year. At the same time, may the glory of God lead our German nation to the right path towards this goal. (31st Hai Tong Telegraph)</p>

<h3 id="e38">National Discussion: Tainting the Reputation of the National Socialist Party; Goebbels's Affair; Passionately in Love with a Female Star, Assaulted and Humiliated; Eyes Bruised and Front Teeth Knocked Out <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(New York) The Morning Journal here today published a copyrighted news novel with an extremely prominent headline. According to the novel, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels was assaulted and injured due to his affair with German movie star Hella Riis's charming Rita Barova, and has been treated in a Berlin hospital since December 22. Previously, Goebbels imprisoned Barova's husband, Hella Riis, on the pretext of facilitating his courtship of Rita Barova. However, Hella's royal friend discovered Goebbels in Hella Riis's apartment and was surprised, and there were attempts to avenge Hella. It is said that Goebbels had a cut on his neck, both eyes were bruised, and one of his front teeth was knocked out. Goebbels's driver immediately stepped forward to stop him, otherwise Goebbels would have suffered more violent beatings. The headline of the news is "Goebbels, the Adulterer, Was Assaulted and Injured; Hitler Is Extremely Angry at the Scandal That Ruined the National Socialist Party." The newspaper also stated that Hitler was displeased with such scandalous events occurring within the National Socialist Party. His prohibition of the screening of films starring Barova is one example. It is said that Goebbels's wife, Floro, is a famous figure in the German women's world. Knowing about her husband's affair with Barova, she has twice wanted to divorce Goebbels. In the past two months, Hitler, seeing that the matter between Goebbels and Barova had reached a crisis, had dissuaded Floro from this. The diplomatic community is paying attention to this official German scandal at a time when US-German relations are tense. They also pointed out that although Germany has protested against the US for publishing its scandals, it may be difficult to obtain a satisfactory response. Recalling that Germany had repeatedly protested to the US about American newspapers publishing news and speeches about the National Socialist Party, it is said that the US response was that the American people have freedom of speech and the government has no right to interfere, which is very regrettable.

<h3 id="e39">Germany's Demand for Submarine Tonnage Equal to Britain's; Said to Be a Response to Russia's Expanding Navy; Representatives of Both Sides Negotiate in Berlin <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(London) London learned today that Germany had notified Britain that it intends to use certain rights under the Anglo-German Naval Agreement to build submarines with a total tonnage equal to that of British submarines. The British Foreign Office issued the following bulletin today: The German government recently notified the British government that it intends to use certain rights granted by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935 and 1937, and therefore representatives of the British Admiralty traveled to Berlin before Thursday to discuss with the relevant German authorities the issues arising from the aforementioned notification. The right referred to stipulates that although the total tonnage of the German navy shall not exceed 35% of the total tonnage of the British navy, it has the right to build submarines with a total tonnage equal to that of British submarines. However, in future situations, when Germany believes that it should use its right to have its submarine tonnage equal to that of Britain, Germany will notify the British government and agree to have friendly discussions with Britain on this matter before the German government uses this right. The British government has requested the German government to agree and has recently notified the naval powers that have treaty relations with Britain to inform them that Germany is willing to use the rights under the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. The powers referred to are the US, France, and Italy, which signed the London Naval Treaty, and the Soviet Union, Poland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland, which have bilateral agreements with Britain. It is hoped that through the talks in Berlin, Germany will agree with the points raised by the British representatives and be in line with the will of Britain. It is said that Britain currently has a total of 75,000 tons of submarines, and Germany has 25,000 tons. Since Germany intends to increase its submarine tonnage, the tonnage of other types of warships of both Britain and Germany must be adjusted so that the total tonnage of the German navy still does not exceed 35% of that of Britain. It is heard that the talks in Berlin also involve the armament of two newly built German cruisers. (31st Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to an announcement issued by the authorities: "A British naval delegation has arrived in Berlin to discuss with the German military authorities issues arising from the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935 and the procedural plans set in July 1937. The German government recently notified the British government, declaring its intention to use certain rights granted by the terms of the agreement." This proves that the British representatives who arrived here this week have discussed the implementation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement with the German authorities. The British naval delegation, led by Admiral Cunningham and other representatives of the Admiralty, met with German naval personnel yesterday and will return to London today. (31st Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) According to news from Berlin today, Germany's attempt to increase submarines and cruisers is regarded by officials here as Germany's response to the Soviet Union's naval construction plan. However, the British side expressed shock at this news, as memories of the European war have not completely disappeared. (31st Associated Press Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the news that Germany is preparing to expand its submarine fleet to the same tonnage as the British submarine fleet, the UK expressed great surprise after the news reached here. Since most politicians have left the capital, official comments are still lacking. Although there is full recognition here that Germany's decision is in accordance with the provisions of the naval agreement, it is felt that the purpose of Germany's move is to counter Britain, and its decision to build large submarines clearly prepares to cut off Britain's supply line in wartime. Therefore, political figures here have once again put forward demands for continued military expansion, and at the same time speculated whether Germany's move has been agreed to by Italy, and whether this matter has had repercussions during Prime Minister Chamberlain's visit to Rome.

<h3 id="e40">British Newspapers Comment on the Future of European Armaments, Believing That It Has a Great Impact <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>(London) After Germany put forward a proposal to increase submarine tonnage to be equal to that of Britain, conservative newspapers here have commented on it, "believing that the result of this negotiation will have a great impact on the future of European armaments." The "Daily Mail" declared that the British delegation will propose certain counter-proposals to the Berlin authorities. The content of which, because British officials are afraid of arousing public opinion, are unwilling to disclose. The newspapers believe that the naval negotiations in Berlin will continue to advance in a friendly atmosphere, but the British delegation has been instructed to ask Germany to explain its naval policy. At the same time, the British side must wait for Prime Minister Chamberlain to discuss with the cabinet before making a statement on this matter. The "Daily Mail" believes that since Germany has put forward a request to increase the tonnage of its submarine fleet, it will proceed with the increase in submarine tonnage regardless of the outcome of the negotiations. The newspaper's diplomatic correspondent believes that the British Admiralty is willing to use Germany's request as a basis for negotiation, but if it agrees to the increase in Germany's submarine tonnage, it must be compensated by a proportional reduction in the tonnage of other warships. The Labour Party's "Daily Express" also commented, believing that this move is related to the Soviet Union's submarine plan. The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet Union currently has 160 submarines with a total tonnage of 81,000 tons. The newspaper then compared the tonnage of the British and German navies, pointing out that although Germany's naval tonnage should only be equal to 35% of Britain's in accordance with the 1935 naval agreement, in fact, Germany currently has a total of 200,000 tons of navy, which is only 15% less than Britain's. At the same time, Germany's oldest submarines are only from 1935, while Britain has some that are 10 years older. Therefore, all newspapers believe that after Germany takes this step, Britain will intensify its military expansion plan and increase the construction of destroyers and mine-laying ships to counter it.

<p>(Rome) How Italy desires territories was recently commented on by the "International Relations" magazine (the organ of the Italian Foreign Ministry), stating that the French Tunisian region in North Africa and the French Djibouti Port in East Africa should be directly annexed by Italy. To maintain peace, the current situation in the Mediterranean should also be thoroughly changed. The Tunisian region is essential for Italy's survival. France sees it only as a matter of superiority and prestige. "At this time, the revolutionary political axis is creating a new Europe and, when necessary, should take action to inform those who doubt the solidity and immovability of this axis. The Tunisian issue should be its touchstone." As for Djibouti Port, it is the best port to Abyssinia and should not be allowed to be controlled by France. (31st Havas Telegraph)</p>

<p>(Washington) Although senators from the western states of the United States have appealed to President Roosevelt to raise the price of silver, well-informed sources believe that the current value of 64 cents per ounce will continue to be maintained. If there is any change, it will only be lowered and will not be increased. (31st Hai Tong Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) The fourth semi-annual report of the British Exchange Equalisation Account was released last night. As of the end of September 1938, the stored gold was valued at 690 million pounds. The gold stored at the end of September 1937 was valued at 815 million pounds, and the gold stored at the end of March 1938 was valued at 835 million pounds. According to reliable sources, the sudden decrease in gold is not surprising, because the Equalisation Account spent a lot of gold in assisting the pound in the six months before the end of September. Initially due to the panic of the devaluation of the US dollar, and then due to the tense international political situation, the escape of European funds to the United States led to a very urgent demand for gold, and the gold stored in the Equalisation Account flowed out a lot.

From January to September, German goods exported to the Soviet Union were only worth 21,000,000 marks, while Soviet goods imported into Germany were worth 35,000,000 marks. Last year, from January to December, German goods exported to the Soviet Union were worth 117,000,000 marks, and Soviet goods imported into Germany were worth 65,000,000 marks. A comparison reveals a significant decline. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>

<h3 id="e52">Navigation of the Arctic Ocean Considered Not Impossible: Results of Russian Scientists' Research <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow - Soviet scientists who traveled the Arctic Ocean in two icebreakers deny that navigation of the Arctic Ocean is impossible. Soviet scientists have now completed their research from inspections along the route. Icebreakers can indeed overcome the solid ice of the Arctic Ocean, and it has been determined that the ice in the Arctic Ocean region is not as dangerous to ships as the ice near the coast, because the ice near the coast contains less salt and melts more slowly. Therefore, navigation of the Arctic Ocean is not impossible. The icebreakers tested the depth three times during the voyage, and the results showed that there is a warm current from the Atlantic Ocean at a depth of 600 feet.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Intense Patriotic Sentiment: Soviet Youths Eagerly Enlist in the Army – Aspiring to Sacrifice Themselves to Defend the Country <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, December - The situation during this year's conscription of new recruits proves that Soviet citizens all regard military service as a glorious responsibility. I examined the situation of the youths enlisting in the army in detail at the conscription office in the Sverdlov district of Moscow. They seemed to be attending a gathering, arriving with their parents, relatives, friends, and loved ones to report. Many requested to join the navy or tank and artillery units, and some insisted on serving in the Far Eastern Red Banner Army. Not only did all those who were drafted come, but many who were not drafted also wanted to enlist early. Generally speaking, in the past two years, there has hardly been a single drafted new recruit in Moscow who did not report. A 21-year-old conscript from this district, Ivan Subolev, was legally exempt from service because he was married and had a three-month-old baby. He wavered greatly, wanting both to serve his country and loving his child deeply. But his wife, Maria, resolutely came forward to ask the political department to allow her husband to enlist. She said that even if her husband did not give her material help, she could live well.</p>
<p>There are many such examples of people unwilling to take advantage of their rights to evade military service. Ilya Smirnov, an education worker from a construction organization in Moscow, wrote to us, "I request that you allow me to join the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army ahead of schedule. I swear that I will not fail the Red Army's trust. I will dedicate my life to serving the cause of the Lenin-Stalin Party." At the same time, his parents also wrote to plead on his behalf, "We are Ilya Smirnov's parents. He was born on July 10, 1918. Please plead with the People's Commissariat of Defense to allow him to enlist in the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army for life. Ilya's eldest brother died fighting in the Red Guards, and his second brother, Pavel, is currently serving in the Red Army for life. We request that you send Ilya to the unit that Pavel is currently in." Signed, Yakov Smirnov, Maria Smirnova. Moscow Province, Volokolamsk City. Another person, Kostrov, wrote the following letter, "I read the public notice from Comrade Voroshilov, Marshal of the Soviet Union and People's Commissar of Defense, conscripting new recruits for the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. I beg you to let me enlist to defend the motherland. I hate the Fascist beasts who incite world war, the enemies of mankind. I want to defend everything that our predecessors fought for in the civil war. I was raised by the Leninist Communist Youth League. I swear that I will complete all the tasks assigned to me, as the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League have taught us." In the past two months, our Sverdlov district political department has received dozens and hundreds of such letters. (Written by Captain Platov)</p>

<h3 id="e54">Recent Market Conditions in Tianjin <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: This reporter returned to Tianjin from Shanghai on the Fuxing Wheel on the 28th of last month. The journey was delayed and it took eight days to reach Tanggu. According to what I knew in Shanghai, in addition to the Taikoo ships, Jardine Matheson's passenger and cargo ships could enter directly and reach Tianjin. Unexpectedly, this has recently changed completely. All ships traveling north from Shanghai and Hong Kong must dock at Tanggu, and all passengers must first undergo hygiene officer inspection to go ashore for epidemic prevention procedures. Then, the Japanese military police and special service agencies stationed in Tanggu will carry out a unified inspection, searching each person carefully. They inquire about the passengers' background and occupation, and pay attention to the banknotes they carry. Each person is limited to 500 yuan, but it must be limited to banknotes issued by the China United Reserve Bank and the Chinese and Japanese banks in North China. Other Shanghai characters are confiscated and cause trouble. This kind of inspection was carried out once when passing through Qingdao. The ship I was on did not find a large amount, but a tea boy on the Shengjing wheel carried 20,000 yuan of Chinese and Japanese tickets in North China. After being discovered, he was immediately detained. It can be said that he was unlucky. Tanggu is the only import point in North China, so the Japanese side has very strict defenses in the area. The two major fine salt and alkali manufacturing companies, Tangzhan Jiuda and Yongli, are now completely controlled by Japanese merchants, operating on a large scale, and their products are very prosperous and profitable. Those who pass the inspection in Tanggu and are deemed to be innocent can buy tickets and take the train to Tianjin. It takes only 50 minutes from Tanggu to Tianjin East Station. Although there is also an inspection at Tianjin Station, it is slightly looser. The vicinity of Tianjin East Station has changed its old appearance. Many shops have been changed to Japanese shops, and it is a completely different style. Even rickshaw pullers wear green military-style caps. It is said that they have also been completely acquired by large-scale capital and implemented unified management. They pay a monthly car rental fee of four or five yuan, and pay a deposit of dozens of yuan before they can pull the car for business. We cannot solicit business. The French Concession of Tianjin is particularly prosperous, with the Lilian area and the Tianzengli area being extremely developed and bustling. All the hotels are full of customers, and the profits are three times the usual. After arriving in Tianjin, the reporter took a short rest and went for a walk with friends in the Chinese and Japanese concessions. Only then did I realize that the Japanese concession was no longer as lively as it used to be, because most of the Chinese had moved out during the incident and have not returned. The Japanese concession authorities have evicted many residents in order to clean up the area. The two most famous opium dens, the Deyilou and the New Hotel, have recently been moved to the Chinese Concession. As for the human flesh markets in Zhongxiaoli and Yudeli, they have also been abandoned because no one patronizes them. Therefore, in addition to a few originally established Chinese shops in the Japanese Concession, the rest are Japanese shops, foreign firms, and various military and political agencies. The Zhongyuan Company has closed down, and Yuhichi Street is cold and deserted, with a gloomy atmosphere. There are very few pedestrians. Many of the houses on the streets have been rebuilt in Eastern style, quite like the Three Islands. All intersections from the Japanese Concession to the Chinese Concession are blocked, leaving only one entrance in the southeast corner of the city, where pedestrians are inspected at any time to prevent accidents. Because it has been rumored in the area for several days that the Chinese army is approaching the suburbs of Tianjin, and it is also the anniversary of the Double Twelfth, there is great panic and such precautions must be taken. The Sanbuguan area of the Chinese Concession has returned to its former prosperity. Opium dens, brothels, teahouses, and restaurants are all gathered here, and tourists are like ants, bustling and extremely prosperous. Dongmalu can still maintain its original state. Although the market is not very prosperous, it can still be dealt with. The Dahutong area is slightly deserted. The Beimalu area used to be old-fashioned shops, so there is no change. However, the soil ointment shops are the most developed and can be found everywhere, and the sales are very good. The goods rely on the public gentry, and the unified tax is also listed as a legitimate business. In addition, all parts of the Chinese Concession are very desolate. Residents close their doors early in the evening and dare not go out. The provincial and municipal offices are all in Hebei, so the family members of the staff of various agencies also live in Hebei. In the intangible, Hebei is only a district of agencies and residences. Tianjin Yongbao and Dongya Chenwanbao have become Japanese-controlled newspapers, specializing in spreading rumors and deceiving the public. The only other private newspapers are Tianfeng, Tiansheng, Xintianjin, and Guoqiang. The source of news is provided by the Tongmeng News Agency, and the content is known. Most of the schools have started classes, but there are not as many students as in the past. The number of schools in the British and French Concessions has increased several times. Recently, the French Concession schools have accepted the requirements to adopt the unified textbooks of North China and are starting to try it out. At present, Tianjin is working hard to promote the so-called "maintaining peace in East Asia" and "building a new order in East Asia." People are arrested for any criticism. Although there are still many patriots secretly active in the concession, the Japanese search very strictly. If they see anything suspicious, they will secretly arrest them, escort them outside the concession, and severely punish them. The concession authorities can do nothing about it. However, although the Japanese are on guard day and night and check everywhere, the patriots' activities continue as before. Tao Shangming, the head of the puppet Ji Education Department, was assassinated and killed a few days ago, killing one as a warning to a hundred. All the puppet bureaucrats who heard the news were filled with fear.</p>
<h3 id="e55">The Discipline of the Japanese Army Invading Austria is Extremely Bad. The Japanese Army Shortens the Outer Defense Line of Guangzhou. Villagers in the Suburbs Repeatedly Kill Japanese Soldiers. <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The war in Guangdong Province has recently become a stalemate. The Chinese army is currently engaged in allocation and deployment, and the Japanese army is also eager to replenish its forces to prevent a Chinese counterattack. Therefore, the Japanese army has been frequently dispatching troops to various strongholds in Guangzhou, Zengcheng, and Sanshui in recent days, using scientific tactics in an attempt to control Guangzhou. Recently, because the outer defense line of Guangzhou is too long, they have had to shorten the defense line. Therefore, after invading Baoan and Shenzhen, they withdrew their forces to the main points north of the Zhangmutou Station on the Kowloon-Canton Railway, and concentrated their main force between Zengcheng and Conghua, which is convenient for the support of the northeastern route. On the one hand, they used shallow-water warships to cover a large part of the army in Sanshui, and divided them into the West River to invade. Therefore, the Japanese army in the West River was divided into two routes: one route in the southwest, occupying Jiujiang (belonging to Nanhai County), Shaping, and Gulao to consolidate the rear of the Japanese army on the Guangzhou-Sanshui line, and at the same time to prevent the Chinese army from attacking from Gaoming. As for the Japanese army in Sanshui, they set up artillery positions along the river, and from time to time bombarded the opposite bank to prevent the Chinese army from crossing the river. Above Sanshui, one route of the Japanese army attempted to peek into Luba, Qingyuan, and Sihui, while the other route was stationed in Guanyao, all the way to Gaotang, to connect with the Japanese army in the North River. Looking at the overall deployment of the Japanese army, the outer defense line of Guangzhou extends from Jiujiang in the west, to Sanshui, Guanyao, to Jiangcun and Zhongluotan in the North River, reaching Zengcheng in the northeast, forming a large arc. Their strength is very weak, relying entirely on setting up artillery positions at various strongholds for cover, and relying on aerial reconnaissance as their eyes and ears for advance and retreat.</p>
<p>The army of the Japanese army in the inland of Guangdong is mostly distributed in the northeast of Guangzhou, using the Guangzhou-Zengcheng Highway and the Guangzhou-Pan-Hua Highway for the dispatch of mechanized troops. The vanguard advanced to Zhongluotan near Conghua and Panyu, and used tethered balloons to detect the movement of the Chinese army. Airplanes were dispatched every day to fly along the Zengcheng front line to Conghua and Xinfeng, and folded out of the Yuehan Road to the Juntian and Lianjiangkou stations to destroy the Chinese army's fortifications. As for the infantry of the Japanese army, they are purely miscellaneous troops, mostly from Northeast China, and mixed with Koreans and Taiwanese. The officers and chiefs are all Japanese. The places where the troops are stationed with Japanese military police are relatively disciplined. Those who are scattered in the countryside without the supervision of military police arbitrarily rape and plunder, causing chickens and dogs to be uneasy. The ferocity of the Japanese soldiers is condoned by the commanders. The treatment of miscellaneous troops is very different from that of the regular Japanese army. The miscellaneous troops who invaded the inland of Guangdong Province mostly wear only one piece of clothing and have no delicacies to eat. Therefore, whenever they arrive in a village, they arbitrarily seize pigs, cattle, chickens, and ducks to satisfy their appetite. If the weather turns cold, they will break into the houses one after another, push open the doors, and seize cotton quilts and cotton clothes. After the villages are plundered by these people, almost every house is empty. The Japanese officers turn a blind eye, because the Japanese officers incite these people to invade South China with color, sound, and wealth. When the purpose has been achieved, they listen to what these people do. The villagers in the inland of Guangdong Province hate the rape of the Japanese army the most. The loss of property is still secondary. Whenever a Japanese soldier rapes a woman in the village, the unarmed villagers will fight to the death. In Xiqiao Township, which belongs to Panyu in Henan, Guangzhou, several Japanese soldiers were killed by the villagers as a result of a woman being raped. The next day, the Japanese sent airplanes to bomb the village in retaliation, destroying dozens of houses. Several days later, the Japanese soldiers came again to harass, and the villagers still fought back head-on. After that, the Japanese finally did not dare to go again. From this, it can be seen that the more evil the Japanese soldiers do, the more hatred they arouse from the people.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Investigation by Western Correspondents: All Sorts of Conditions in Hankou. People Cannot Make a Living, and Foreigners are Greatly Affected. The Japanese Do Whatever They Want with Oppression and Destruction. <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Correspondence from a correspondent of the North China Daily News after investigating in Hankou: When Hankou fell, there were 150,000 residents, only one-fifth of the normal population. The huge reduction in residents is beyond anyone's expectation. The normal population in the concession is 40,000. When the Japanese army arrived in Hankou, these 150,000 survivors were all cramped in the concession. The first step of the Japanese side was to establish a refugee area in the poorest area two miles away from the concession. This area, called Wusheng Temple (transliteration), has become the most densely populated area. It is currently estimated that the population reaches 90,000 to 100,000. The rest are scattered in the French Concession and the first, second, and third special zones. There is no shortage of rice and grain for the Chinese, which should be attributed to the refugee committee's foresight. Fresh vegetables are also quite abundant. Although the villagers plant grains as quickly as possible, new grains cannot be harvested immediately, so food shortages are inevitable. To this day, fresh meat is still quite abundant, but like vegetables, it is not a healthy sign, because livestock are slaughtered and are gradually becoming scarce. Most of the Chinese area of Hankou is still desolate. Before the Chinese army abandoned Hankou, they bombed the buildings of the Japanese Concession and the municipal government. Other than that, everything in the three towns of Wuhan was undamaged. Since the withdrawal of the Chinese army, there have been continuous fires in the Chinese area, and most of it has been reduced to ashes. Only the refugee area was completely unaffected by the fire. The Japanese army transported all the valuable items in the area outside the concession, and the rest were used as firewood. It is often heard and repeatedly verified that Japanese sentries loot money when searching Chinese pedestrians. Rape is often heard. The refugee area is guaranteed safe by the Japanese military police, so there is less harassment. However, the situation in Wuchang is very different. The Japanese military authorities not only refused to allow the church to do refugee relief work, but also wanted to expel the 6,000 refugees in the large church buildings. When they failed, they used extreme measures, not allowing the refugees to obtain food and drink, and gradually starving them to death. Men, women, children, and domestic animals in the countryside outside Hankou are not safe. Startling news often comes from the countryside, such as the burning of houses and the seizure of property. The increasing number of people who go up the Han River and enter the refugee area is a clear proof of this. Chinese people must have identification cards to live and travel freely, but the Japanese do not issue these cards to everyone. For example, the Chinese who live in certain foreign-owned houses are refused these cards, because the Japanese are eager to use this to force the Chinese to move out and use the houses themselves. The purpose of the Japanese is to make the Chinese return home, but their various actions have made it impossible to achieve their goal. Such as mistreating pedestrians, not issuing travel permits to those who temporarily live in the French Concession, imposing various restrictions on the free movement of residents, vehicles, and goods, destroying industries, and committing violence against the villagers, all of which prevent Hankou from returning to its original state soon.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Current Status of Shanghai National Medicine Colleges: Cultivating Doctors to Benefit Society; Providing Medical Treatment and Medicine to Aid the Poor <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Currently, there are three national medicine colleges in Shanghai: Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, China Medical College, and New China Medical College. Each college has its own clinic, providing medical treatment and medicine to benefit the poor and sick. The current status of each college, based on recent investigations, will be described below:</p>
<p>The New China Medical College was founded in the autumn of 1935. Currently, it is headed by Zhu Nanshan's son, Xiaonan, as president, with Zhu Hegao as vice-president, Zhu Weiju and Chen Rongzhang as deans of the research institute, and Bao Tianbai as director of academic affairs. There are over 40 professors and lecturers. Before the war, the college organization included a research institute, with a total of 350 students. Four students have already graduated from the research program, and over 100 from the undergraduate program. Currently, there are students in the first, second, third, and fourth years, totaling over 230, including over 50 female students. The curriculum is divided into basic and applied sciences, with 12 subjects in each category. Traditional Chinese medicine is combined with Western methods. Before the war, the college had several buildings built in Dachang, including seven classrooms and a teaching hospital, as well as the Hengfeng Road clinic. Currently, it rents a residence in the Wangjiasha Garden, with three classrooms. First and second-year students attend classes full-time, third-year students practice in the morning and attend classes in the afternoon, and fourth-year students practice full-time. The clinics of Research Dean Wang, the Gordon Road clinic, and the college's affiliated clinic are designated as practice locations for the students. Students pay tuition each semester: 39 yuan for first and second-year students, and 43 yuan for third and fourth-year students. Board and lodging are not provided. The college's annual expenditure is in the tens of thousands of yuan, mainly covered by the president, in addition to fundraising by the board of directors. Extracurricular activities for students include specimen collection and a research association. It is said that the college plans to recruit over ten transfer students for each grade after the winter vacation.</p>
<p>The China Medical College was founded in 1927. The first president was Zhang Taiyan. After 1928, when Xue Wenyuan served as president, the college was located on Laobazi Road. Since Guo Boliang took charge of the college affairs, new buildings have been constructed on Tiantong'an Road, with Laobazi Road serving as the second campus. A hospital has also been added. After the war, the alumnus Yang Danran generously lent his house on Beile Road for initial relocation. Later, due to a shortage of rooms caused by the increasing number of students, classes were moved to Chongqing Road. The president has made a decision; the vice presidents are Zhu Ziyun and Cai Xiangsun, the director of general affairs is Yan Cangshan, and the director of academic affairs is Wu Keqian. There are over 50 faculty and staff members. Before the war, there were over 400 students, and 11 graduating classes have been held, producing over 600 doctors. Currently, there are over 200 students in the first, second, third, and fourth years, including over 30 female students, and over 40 boarding students. The curriculum follows the subjects formulated by the Traditional Chinese Medicine Committee of the Ministry of Health and the regulations of the Textbook Editorial Committee of the National Federation of Medical and Pharmaceutical Associations. Emphasis is placed on both academic subjects and practical experience. Before the war, the college had spacious buildings built for its own use. Currently, it rents temporary school buildings with three classrooms. First and second-year students attend classes full-time, third-year students practice in the morning and attend classes in the afternoon, and fourth-year students practice full-time. There are three clinics: the Baxianqiao and Malang Road clinics, and the college's affiliated clinic. Students pay tuition each semester: 35 yuan for first and second-year students, and 39 yuan for third and fourth-year students. Board and lodging are not provided. The college's annual expenditure is 10,000 yuan. Students are conducting extracurricular research and editing the "China Medical Science" monthly magazine, which has already published two issues. It is said that the college plans to recruit evening students this spring to allow working people to engage in the study of national medicine in their spare time. It is also said that the college's director of academic affairs, Wu Keqian, has compiled medical books such as Dictionary of Disease Sources, Dictionary of Medicinal Properties, Wu's Pediatrics, and Practical Diagnostics, which are now in circulation.</p>
<p>The Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine was founded in 1918 by Ding Ganren. Originally named the Chinese Medicine Specialized School, it was the first school of its kind for traditional Chinese medicine. In 1931, it was renamed to its current name. The original location was in Shipi Lane inside the West Gate. After the war, classes were moved to temporary school buildings on Shanxi Road and Tianjin Road. The current president is Ding Jiwan, and the director of academic affairs is Huang Wendong. There are over 20 faculty and staff members. Before the war, there were 300 students, and 19 graduating classes have been held, cultivating nearly a thousand doctors. Currently, there are over 200 students in the first, second, and third years, with female students accounting for about one-tenth. The curriculum emphasizes traditional Chinese medicine, integrates new knowledge, and refers to the curriculum regulations of various medical colleges. There are 18 subjects. There are four classrooms. First and second-year students attend classes full-time, third-year students practice in the morning and attend classes in the afternoon, and fourth-year students practice full-time at three locations: Ding's clinic, Hualong Chinese Medicine Hospital, and Shanghai National Hospital. Students pay tuition each semester: 40 yuan for first and second-year students, 44 yuan for third-year students, and 54 yuan for fourth-year students. Students are conducting extracurricular research, and after the war, they published "The砥礪 Weekly," contributing to the field of medicine.</p>
<p>School Overview</p>
<h3 id="e60">Southern Middle School <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The private Southern Middle School was founded after the August 13th Incident last year. At that time, because the former Municipal Jingye Middle School was suspended, Dr. Chen Tingrui, a senior figure in the education community, considering that a part of the school's faculty and staff wished to continue the education lifeline and maintain the students' studies, while also taking into account their own livelihoods, generously assumed full financial responsibility. Following the regulations for private middle schools stipulated by the Ministry, he submitted an application to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for approval and registration, and then forwarded it to the Ministry of Education for record. The school rented premises at No. 75 Xieqiao Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, with only over 200 students, both male and female. In the second semester, the number of students increased to over 500, and the original school buildings were insufficient for use. Consequently, No. 208, Lane 591, Jing'an Temple Road, was rented as a second section. This semester, the school moved to No. 660 Baker Road, the original site of Guanghua University, and the two sections were merged. The number of students has increased to over 800. Except for over 60 boarding students, all are day students. The school has over 40 faculty and staff members, all of whom are scholars with knowledge and experience who graduated from famous universities at home and abroad. The school's system is divided into junior and senior high school sections. Junior high school does not have specialized departments, while senior high school is divided into general and civil engineering departments. Currently, there are eight junior high school classes.

At the end of the first half, the Soviet army had a one-goal lead. At the beginning of the second half, Adam's two corner kicks were very dangerous. In the fourteenth minute, Shen Shiyan made his first great achievement, tying the score at 1-1. Three minutes later, Shen Shiyan's luck came and he attacked diagonally from the side, scoring again. Donghua came from behind to take the lead 2-1. One minute later, Shu Shigeng was awarded a free kick, and Kui Ning took it from fifteen yards out. Qin Bigao was momentarily stunned and watched as the ball went into the left corner. The score remained tied at 2-2.

<h3 id="e70">Finance: Supply and Demand Balanced; Cash Fluctuations Small; Hong Kong Buyers Quite Enthusiastic; Wealthy Individuals Liquidate Due to Year-End <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash shacha gold market was buoyed by a sharp rise in London pure gold, which further excited Hong Kong buyers. A certain money exchange house purchased a large amount, while another gold shop also made some purchases on behalf of others. Fortunately, due to year-end considerations, many local clients released gold holdings, and securities firms, gold shops, and silver shops were also willing to sell. As a result, supply and demand were balanced, and the market saw little change, with only a four-yuan difference in price. Trading volume was similar to the previous day, with over 500 taels in the morning and slightly less than 100 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Shacha Unofficial Trading Down Only One Yuan</p>
<p>From the start of the morning, there was no trading in the shacha (ten-tael bars). Around 9:30 a.m., a certain gold shop purchased 50 taels on behalf of Hong Kong buyers at 1,991 yuan per bar, which was the opening price. Subsequently, Hong Kong buyers instructed a certain money exchange house to absorb a large amount, purchasing 100 taels from fellow dealers at 92 yuan and another 100 taels at 91 yuan (these were released by wealthy long position holders). Another gold shop purchased 30 taels from fellow dealers at 90 yuan. Soon after, another money exchange house came to purchase, buying 50 taels each from gold shops and securities firms at 92 yuan, and 50 taels from fellow dealers at 91 yuan. After this, a local client suddenly released gold holdings through another money exchange house, and because there were many observers, the price fell slightly. 30 taels were sold to fellow dealers at the lowest price of 88 yuan, and another 100 taels were sold to fellow dealers at the same price (those who bought back were replenishing their previous sales). Silver shops traded 30 taels amongst themselves, also at 88 yuan. The price then stabilized for a while. At 11:30 a.m., a money exchange house purchased 50 taels from a securities firm at 90 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning session. Afternoon trading was thin, mainly due to the lack of foreign exchange market activity and the year-end factors. The market was quiet until 3:40 p.m., when a silver shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange house at 91 yuan. At 4:00 p.m., another silver shop sold 30 taels to a money exchange house at 1,992 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening session, down one yuan from the previous day. The selling price of cash brand gold at gold shops remained at 2,000 yuan, and the buying price was 1,985 yuan. The current standard gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with no trading activity.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Still at 302 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael did not change due to the relatively stable shacha market. Datongxing, Laoqingyun, and other shops maintained the original price of 202 yuan, while new shops charged 200 yuan and bought back at 194 yuan.</p>
<p>British Pure Gold Soars by Five Pence</p>
<p>London, 30th: British pure gold soared by five pence per ounce due to tensions between France and Italy, reaching seven pounds, nine shillings, five and a half pence, causing the Central Bank's purchase price of Chinese pure gold to rise to 1,220 yuan and one cent. The listed customs gold also rose sharply by seven li, totaling two yuan, four jiao, one fen, and two li. The Shanghai standard gold price also rose accordingly by three yuan, four jiao, totaling 1,215 yuan and four jiao.</p>
<p>Businesses to Close for Four Days for the New Year</p>
<p>Today is the Gregorian calendar New Year's Day. Chinese and foreign banks and money businesses, including Sundays, will be closed for four days. Cash and foreign exchange markets will also be closed for four days and will resume normal operations on January 5th (Thursday).</p>
<h3 id="e71">British and Indian Silver Prices Both Rise <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>London, 30th: Speculators bought in, transactions were limited, and the market was fairly stable. After the close, it was also very stable. There were buyers at the listed price, but sellers held back. The price of large silver bars for both near and distant futures rose by 0.0625. The New York silver price and the American silver price remained unchanged. According to a telegram from Montreux, near and distant futures remained unchanged. A telegram from Mumbai indicated that the market was slightly firmer, and the spot price of Indian silver and both near and distant futures rose by two anna.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Profiteers Taking Profits; Gold Pound Down Slightly by Five Jiao <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold rose by five pence, British-American exchange rates fell by 0.0875, foreign exchange supply and demand were fairly balanced, and it was also Gregorian calendar New Year's Eve. Banks were busy closing their accounts and had no time for this. Only a few settlements were due, and some profiteers sold slightly, trending slightly firm. The fluctuation of shacha was small, and the process was stable. Because New Year's Day has arrived, and there will be a four-day holiday, individual investors were cautious and watched, so it was very stable. Foreign currency collectors sold off to take profits to avoid long-term risks, so prices generally fell, trending weaker. The association's transactions were sparse. Only Yongtai sold a U.S. dollar draft to Changtai for 1,000 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: the gold pound fell by five jiao, the gold draft fell by one jiao and six fen, the U.S. gold pound fell by five jiao, the U.S. dollar draft fell by three fen and five li, the Hong Kong draft fell by two fen, the French franc draft rose by one li, the Singapore draft fell by one fen, the Dutch draft fell by one fen, the Canadian draft fell by two fen, the Philippine draft fell by three fen, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Discount Rates Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for drafts and bills of exchange remained relatively stable, generally hovering around 40 yuan per thousand yuan, with the final price still at 40 yuan, the same as the previous day.</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>A guest said to me: The name "Business and Industry Roundtable" has a sense of "harmony," and without a "seat," how can there be a "discussion?" Therefore, it is not suitable for the times, and it is not satisfactory in meaning. Why do you take it?</p>
<p>I said, is that so! I just casually came up with it at the time! Today, what is the intention behind speaking of "harmony?" Indeed, the term "roundtable" has a sense of "harmony." I will abandon it without hesitation. How could I defile my esteemed "business and industry" with "harmony?" If business and industry are indeed tainted with "harmony," then it is the fault of business and industry themselves, and they will mislead their descendants! I believe that there are many wise people in the business and industry world who are good at protecting their property and will never rashly "harmonize."</p>
<p>Culture originally has no national boundaries and should be mutually connected, but in an era of invasion, reading and using its writing is very different from the usual pursuit of knowledge. It is simply showing a desire to be a subjugated slave! Therefore, no matter how small a thing is, anything that can be avoided should be avoided. So, what name should we take? Is it okay to call it Talking Seat? One and two, two and one, it is still the same soup with different medicine. Can it be said that it is not tainted with "harmony?"</p>
<p>Calling it Business and Industry Assistance in Discussion is perhaps closer to the mark, and its literal meaning is completely domestic. The origin of the words "talking and assisting" comes from Cai Yong's acquisition of Wang Chong's "Lun Heng," which he secretly enjoyed as a talking aid. And the making of Wang Chong's "Lun Heng," as previous people evaluated it, was "new and unique in its arguments, striving to fully express its meaning, not hesitating to use verbose words, generally correcting errors and criticizing customs, with many reasonable points, and it is also very helpful for education." The establishment of the Business and Industry Roundtable in this newspaper was originally intended to assist business and industry, to elaborate on opinions, and to discuss gains and losses. It is not a criticism or an argument. Calling it Talking Aid, compared with Cai Yong's stealing of other people's writings as a talking aid, there is certainly a difference; and it has the same intention as "Lun Heng" in correcting errors, criticizing customs, striving to fully express its meaning, and not hesitating to use verbose words.</p>
<p>The year of the 28th year of the Republic of China is the year of the victory of the Chinese nation's resistance war. Since the guest said that "roundtable" is tainted with "harmony," therefore, taking advantage of the beginning of the year, we renamed this column Business and Industry Assistance in Discussion, for the rest of the business of the business community, to talk about the status of commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Foreign Exchange Black Market Loosens Again: Sassoon and Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank All Choked Up; British-American Exchange Rates Also Frequently Shrink <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange market, influenced by the frequent shrinkage of British-American exchange rates, initially showed a situation of British parity and American tightness. Later, due to the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank and Sassoon, etc., experiencing clogging again, banks' digestion was unhealthy, and foreign firms' settlements were also rare. Therefore, the situation became loose and firm, and transactions were still active.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's big bills rebounded, while New York's silver prices and the Monte Video silver price remained unchanged. London's raw gold surged five pence. The exchange rate of British against American sharply fell seven percent, against French fell nineteen centimes, against Shanghai remained the same. American against British also violently shrunk eight seven five, against French slightly three one two five, against Shanghai fell one dime and a half. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with selling prices of British exchange at eight pence four zero six two five, and American exchange at sixteen yuan two eight one two five. Compared to the previous close, British was flat and American was slightly tighter by zero three one two five. After opening, settlements by Asia, Texaco, and major foreign firms were still frequent, eagerly buying up both British and American gold. At the same time, American oil firms also came to compete for American gold. The tightest British gold price was eight pence three seven five, and the softest American gold price reached sixteen yuan three one two five. The Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank's listed price was announced unchanged, and the White Silver Equalization Tax was announced to be largely half. After this, due to the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank and Sassoon, etc., experiencing clogging again, and banks' digestion being poor, the situation suddenly became loose. The firmest British gold reached eight pence four five three one two five, and American gold reached sixteen yuan four zero six two five. Near noon, money exchange shops also frequently sold Hong Kong exchange, with the price strengthening from fifty-six yuan six two five to fifty-six yuan seven five. Extending to twelve o'clock, the banks' selling prices were as follows: British exchange eight pence four six eight seven five, American exchange sixteen yuan four zero six two five. Compared to the previous close, British was firmer by zero six two five, American was looser by zero nine three seven five, and Hong Kong exchange lengthened by one two five. In the afternoon, Monday the 6th was without a market. The half-day transactions are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e75">Securities: Foreign Debt Firm and Strong; Actual Delivery Nonexistent <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>London's Chinese foreign debt listed market price on the 30th of this month (Sunday, the 5th) showed a consistent firm and rising market sentiment, increasing by five shillings to one pound. British-German continued loan British-issued bonds and Chinese-French American gold bonds with imprinted bonds each continued to rise by half a pound, with the former priced at seventy-eight pounds and the latter at seventy-six pounds. British Boxer Indemnity bonds British-issued bonds and Daqing Railway bonds each rose by one pound, with the former priced at fifty-eight pounds and the latter at twenty-seven pounds. Vickers airplane bonds and Longhai Railway imprinted bonds each rose by five shillings, with the former priced at thirteen pounds fifteen shillings and the latter at fourteen pounds. Tianjin-Pukou Railway original loan British-German issued bonds also rebounded by half a pound each, priced at eighteen pounds. Due to the New Year holidays and the influence of the development of the current situation, there were no telegrams to Shanghai for actual supply.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Pro-Peace Telegram Caused Turmoil in the Bond Market; Results Mostly Returned Small <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The off-exchange trading of securities yesterday saw quite rapid fluctuations in the market situation. Due to Jingwei's pro-peace telegram, various parties felt dazed and uneasy. The issue of peace or war seemed to have reached its final transition. Furthermore, with the relation of many days of holidays, a small number of large investors, both long and short, eagerly wished to fulfill their buying and selling desires in this half-day market. Therefore, although selling sentiment was strong, buying sentiment was also brave, and competition was extremely fierce. In the early morning opening, Xin Yonghao frantically dumped Type E, and the market price gradually weakened. Le Maohao took advantage of the low market price of Type E, independently absorbing it with great enthusiasm, and the market price was raised again. Others such as No. 38 and Tong Kanghao also slightly absorbed, and the market price stabilized. As a result, Types A and D had no honor or disgrace, with the remainder slightly smaller by five cents to two dimes. Due to the many days of holidays, delivery procedures were handled in the afternoon, so the market was closed. The total number of transactions in half a day was around 700,000 yuan. Starting today, there is a four-day New Year holiday. A clear and concise table is created below:</p>
<h3 id="e77">Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Transactions Few; Last Month's Market Trend Similar to Stereotype; Bean Cake and Raw Peanuts Shipped to Shantou <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last day of the year 27, and starting today, the miscellaneous grain market will be closed for four days, reopening on the 5th. Therefore, there were few transactions. Only 500 bags of Chongming sandy yellow beans were traded, priced at seven yuan one dime and a half to six yuan nine dimes, purchased by the Xiamen gang in this street. 700 bags of Wuhu soybeans were agreed upon, priced at six yuan eight dimes and a half, with the goods needing to be delivered, so the market price slightly increased. 35 bags of Pudong broad beans were transacted, priced at eight yuan three dimes and a half. Recalling the trends of the past month, the market price of Chongming sandy yellow beans, from the beginning to the end of the month, seemed stereotypical, with the highest price not exceeding seven yuan two dimes and the lowest price not falling below six yuan eight dimes. As for arrivals and storage, they were not excessive, and sales were still active. Therefore, according to the predictions of people in the industry, the market situation at the beginning of the year 28 will often not deviate from the path of hovering.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 612 tons of soybeans were shipped to Shantou, 108 tons to Colombo, and 26 tons to Riga. Today's exports include 980 bags to Hong Kong and 100 bags to Shantou.</p>
<p>Also, today, 3,300 small bean cakes, 8,000 large bean cakes, and 200 bags of raw peanuts are being shipped to Shantou.</p>
<h3 id="e78">North-South Goods: Lake Lotus Arrivals Squeezed Short <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Among red lotuses, the most decisive are lake lotuses from Jiangbei, which are the most common. Recently, due to no continuous arrivals, the market is extremely lacking, and prices have also risen. Yesterday, the higher-priced ones sold for thirty yuan, and the less decisive ones with slight insect damage sold for twenty-eight to twenty-nine yuan. With the supply squeezed short, the trend is firm.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Yarn and Cotton: Raw Cotton Insufficient for Supply; Chinese Factories Endure Pain to Order Foreign Cotton; 20% Deposit Paid First for Orders; Full Payment Required for Spot Goods Delivered to Factory; Local Cotton Factories Did No Business At All <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The market price of foreign cotton in New York initially fell due to southern hedging and the liquidation of some bulls. Spot transactions were also few due to the end of the year. The number of purchases by peers was very small. Ultimately, due to brisk sales of yarn and cloth, cotton prices turned firm. As a result, American cotton rose six to seven pounds on yesterday's close, Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose one and a half rupees, and Egyptian cotton fell five to six pounds. Yesterday's exchange rate shrunk, converting into legal currency, and cotton prices all rose. American cotton and Brazilian cotton each rose two dimes and a half per picul, Egyptian cotton rose four dimes, and Indian cotton rose more than eight dimes.</p>
<p>Since two weeks ago, each Chinese factory in this city, because foreign cotton foreign firms treated us harshly, using the excuse that the Far East was extremely dangerous and that war insurance could not be added after the goods arrived in Shanghai, forced Chinese factories to pay the full amount of cotton first when ordering futures that had not yet been shipped. If it was spot goods that had arrived in Shanghai, they had to pay the full amount of the cotton before they would deliver the goods to the factory. The conditions were harsh beyond compare. Details were published in the 18th of this newspaper. Later, due to the resistance of each Chinese factory, expressing non-cooperation with the foreign firms, after several days of stalemate, the cotton firms, after being hit by this, gradually improved their attitude and established new rules. For all Chinese factories purchasing foreign cotton, if ordering futures, the deposit was reduced to 20% first, and the remaining 80% had to be paid immediately when the ship entered the port. If purchasing spot goods, they still needed to pay in full before they could be delivered to the factory. Foreign cotton foreign firms in this city actually gathered each peer to jointly implement this, taking advantage of our weakness of being a scattered mess, coercing our factories. The maliciousness of their intentions is evident from this. However, each Chinese manufacturer was able to jointly resist it for the first few days. Later, because thick cotton felt slightly short, they panicked. Yong'an first ordered 2,000 bales of Indian cotton under these harsh conditions, and was actually sold by the foreign cotton firms, which is extremely distressing. It is hoped that the person in charge of each Chinese factory can convene a general meeting immediately, and also be able to unite with each other, take collective action, and jointly discuss good policies, until these harsh conditions are overturned. This is not only for the benefit of this factory alone, but also to increase glory for the country. It is respectfully hoped that each Chinese factory can realize this as soon as possible. The transaction amount and current market prices yesterday are listed separately below:</p>
<p>Transaction Amount Yesterday</p>
<p>Because yesterday was the New Year's Eve of the 27th year, both Chinese and foreign factories had closed their accounts, and the New Year market also had several days of holidays. Japanese factories were preparing to celebrate the New Year, and had to decide on the direction of transactions after the market reopened. Therefore, local cotton business was completely stagnant, and the situation was generally mediocre. Peers' willingness to buy was more sluggish than in the past. The sources on the docks included 483 bales of Tonghua arrivals and 500 bales of cotton from Xingang. Today, exports will include 50 bales to Shantou, 210 bales to Hong Kong, and 50 bales to Haikou.</p>

<h3 id="e81">New Year Will Suspend Market for Four Days; Current Yarn Prices Inevitably Uneven; Many Floating Traders' Goods Appear; Shuangma Brand Single Yarn is Uniquely Strong <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is as firm and stable as ever, with the trend slightly uneven. Because the current yarn market will be closed from New Year's Day until the 5th when the market opens as usual, yesterday, the Nanhua, Hushan, and Diandong gangs continued to purchase without rest. Haiphong also had a taste for it, and the needs of the Zhejiang East Ningbo and Taizhou gangs continued to come. Therefore, people's hearts were consolidated. Among peers, the search for single Shuangma yarn stack goods of 20 counts was eager, and the pull was especially strong. However, some floating traders' goods, because they had profited and it was the end of the year, took the opportunity to spit them out, with earning money as the top priority. Therefore, a batch of yarn prices was resold in this process, on the contrary, one yuan smaller. According to the market, this recent low peak has already risen by about 25 yuan. This real need to consolidate the foundation should be firm. However, the current output is much larger than in the past. The future is that we continue to move forward, still using real needs as flexibility. Yesterday's market situation, at the opening in the early morning, because the Yunnan gang's taste for coarse and fine counts was still strong, people's hearts rebounded, and the opening price was increased by two yuan. The price of 20 counts Shuangma yarn was 359 yuan, and 20 counts Shuangdiqiu was 353 yuan. Following this, with brisk customer sales, the price was raised by one yuan again. Then, with those who had profited spitting it out, and also being in the middle of the holidays, it retreated by one yuan and a half. Shuangma was done at 358 yuan. The Shantou gang absorbed it again at a low price, and returned to the previous one yuan. However, 20 counts Tejincheng was uniquely weak because the foundation was loose. As a result, the morning transaction statistics totaled 1,075 bales. The afternoon transaction the previous day was 355 bales, totaling 1,430 bales. Market prices: 20 counts Tiannv rose five dimes, Shuangdiqiu rose one yuan, Shuangma rose one yuan and a half, Muyang rose two yuan, Sanxing rose three yuan, but Tejincheng fell one yuan. 32 counts Sanxing fine yarn rose five yuan, and 10 counts coarse yarn rose three to four yuan, etc. Xinhuo Factory opened 100 bales of 20 counts Wuzi, priced at 350 yuan. Tongyi Factory opened 100 bales of 20 counts Jinji, priced at 360 yuan. Anda Factory opened 100 bales of 20 counts Feihu, priced at 355 yuan. Today, 930 pieces will be shipped to Shantou, 150 pieces to Hong Kong, 55 pieces to Guangzhouwan, 185 pieces to Haikou, and 1,180 pieces to Haiphong. The amount of each gang's purchases is as follows:</p>
<p>Ningbo 150 Shantou 140 Xiamen 5 North Gang 20</p>
<p>Yunnan 145 Peers 590 Haiphong 35</p>

<p>The previous day, existing Dalian oil customers rushed to load, and the market price suddenly increased to 27 yuan three dimes. Futures were also tight. Yesterday's market was the end of the year 27, and transactions were quiet. Only existing Dalian oil was transacted for 95 barrels. Because speculators were eager to dump, the market price was dumped at 27 yuan one dime. An order for 100 barrels for delivery on January 15th was transacted, priced at 26 yuan six dimes. No other oils were transacted. Recalling the market situation in December, it was stormy and unpredictable. Indeed, each customer's stomach was concentrated here, and in this extraordinary period, it created many guerrilla-style buying and selling. Therefore, the market sentiment often exceeded normal. However, according to the overall trend, there was more glory than disgrace. It is expected that the foundation of the market when it reopens after the New Year will also be consolidated.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 400 tons of tung oil were shipped to Hamburg.</p>
<p>Today, 580 pieces of raw oil and 200 pieces of sesame oil are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>The market situation is increasingly tight, and the rising wind is strong. Because actual sales are smooth and the yarn market is rising even more fiercely, people's hearts are excited, and the intention to hoard goods has deepened. The market price shows a rapidly rising trend. Spot fine cloth, after being searched for by the Hunan-Jiangxi gangs, about 300 pieces of Dasheng Peacock Kuiyu and other brands were acquired. After 200 pieces of Fugui Dapeng and other brands were purchased by the Zhejiang Road in this street, the factories had no remaining stock. The spot goods in the hands of peers in the market are lacking. Yesterday, the banking community purchased 50 bales of Fugui fine cloth, and the market price immediately surged to 11 yuan two dimes, rising another dime compared to before. Dapeng's opening price increased by a dime and a half. Miscellaneous brands in the market also increased their prices by one or two dimes. Fine twill is still firm and high. Dyed gray cloth orders are delivered most frequently. Sales of coarse cloth are flat, and hoarders from Zhejiang Road and the Yangtze River gang continued to purchase more than 200 bales. Shantou and Ningbo gangs' tastes for colored cloth and printed goods are still good. The Fujian gang's taste for colored twill is strongest, with nearly 200 boxes transacted, rushed to be loaded immediately. The Sichuan-Yunnan gangs purchased more than 3,000 pieces of spring goods, bleached cloth, satin, poplin, colored satin, and colored cloth twill.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>Sales of fine cloth and fine twill continue to rise. Yesterday, because it was the end of the year, although there were not many purchases by customers, the mutual transactions among peers in this street were still very lively. Fine cloth continued to rise by five cents per piece. The wholesale price is higher than the retail price by five cents. Dongmian Foreign Firm opened more than 300 pieces of fine twill of Yanghe, Longtou, and Wufu brands. Yanghe Longtou opened at ten yuan zero seven dimes, and Wufu at ten yuan zero six dimes. Therefore, peers' hands are tight and will not let go. The market situation is very firm.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>Today, 110 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Shantou, 63 pieces to Hankou, and 135 pieces to Haiphong.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Silk and Tea: Year-End Silk Prices Surge Ten Yuan <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The silk market at the end of the year suddenly became excited. Accounts from France and the United States came frequently, and purchase prices all surged by ten yuan. 7/8 grade white factory silk sold for 1,300 yuan. Non-uniformity B grade silk from the factory was priced at 1,260 yuan. Chang, Kaili, Jianchang, Lianna, and other firms together purchased nearly 200 piculs. The silk market at the beginning of the year may become even higher as a result. Also, foreign firms are closed for four days for the New Year. The silk market must also reopen on the 5th. Therefore, yesterday's extremely enthusiastic market situation had to be temporarily silent, waiting for the reopening before rising again.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Grains: Northern Direction to Production Areas Directly Purchases Wheat <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat transactions also saw a reduction. Each had one or two thousand bags of Che Lun source (1,200 bags from Xingang). At present, it is heard that the North China region is directly purchasing from the production areas. Local market prices have already been raised, and vendors are even fewer. Therefore, sellers insisted on not selling, and factories' tastes were also very bland. Therefore, there were not many transactions. The total market only opened 5,000 bags, of which 3,000 bags were purchased by Fuxin Factory and 2,000 bags were purchased by Fufeng Factory. The highest price for Jiangbei wheat was six yuan six dimes, Pudong wheat was six yuan five dimes and a half, Nanjing wheat was six yuan five dimes three cents, and Wuhu wheat was six yuan five dimes two cents. The market is temporarily in a firm and stable situation.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Flour Customer Sales Virtually Stop; 10,000 Bags Still in This Street <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot flour transactions, customer sales remained sluggish as before. Retail sales in this street increased slightly. Each flour mill, because the holidays had arrived, was preparing to stop all operations and repair machinery. The supply of flour for customer sales has virtually stopped, and except for some North-South customer gangs reporting the shipment of stored flour before the New Year, new transactions will all be discussed after the reopening. However, there were 10,000 bags transacted in this street, because the need slightly increased due to the three-day closure. No. 2 flour was still four yuan eight dimes five cents. No. 2 flour lacked goods and had no market. Today, 25 tons of flour will be shipped to Shantou.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Rice Presents Year-End Scene <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of domestic rice, a total of 14/15 "wheelbarrow buns" of Heshang goods arrived with more than 3,000 bags. Sales, due to the year-end summary period of the Gregorian calendar, rarely made progress. Therefore, the overall situation presented a year-end atmosphere, quiet and unusual. Sellers, thinking about the two-day closure for the Gregorian calendar New Year's Day, except for those who insisted on waiting for the opening of the year to sell, mostly urgently wanted to sell. Transactions were very accommodating, and customers took the opportunity to cut prices. As a result, the market was soft, and the market price of glutinous rice, in addition to falling by one dime to a dime, was also settled. Du Yangjian Port, although goods were scarce, also presented a soft color. Only Yinbian Yuan, a seasonal essential product, had a wide road, and was still outstanding.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Stockpilers Sell Lower-Priced Customer Xian Rice <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, customer Xian rice had floating stockpilers and retailers selling at lower prices to settle accounts. The market trended downward, and goods below the intermediate grade were allowed to be soft. Stolen goods such as Nanjing Special New Xian were still asking for ten yuan zero three or four dimes, and Wuhu High Xian also needed more than ten yuan, while intermediate and secondary goods were sold at one dime lower due to the dumping of floating goods. Secondary goods were only sold for nine yuan, and large market goods were nine yuan five or six dimes. Wuhu machine Yuan rice was attracted by high prices, and the arrival of goods gradually increased, and Heshang Bian Yuan had also been transported, and the price was suppressed by nearly one dime. High-grade goods in the general market only opened at twelve yuan two or three dimes. Transactions of all Xian Yuan rice for the whole day were still less than 1,000 bags, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Sugar Market: Shantou Sugar Has Signs of Rising <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, due to news from the Chao gang that Shantou's tastes had increased for several days, and production prices were also tight, high-grade cotton white rose one yuan, and cotton red rose to a similar extent. Upstream green also rose several dimes. Therefore, the trend in the Shanghai market gradually became established. The number of Shantou cotton white stocks on the account side was already small, and asking prices increased. There were no transactions yet, but Chao Green was still sold out with the market. The higher-priced ones were twelve yuan, and the secondary ones retreated. Bingchang Zheng cotton red asked for fifteen yuan and oxen, and merchants returned fifteen yuan but did not succeed. High-grade common opened at four yuan and a half. Jian gang miscellaneous road white opened at twenty-one yuan to eighteen yuan two dimes. Diao Green opened at twelve yuan six dimes to ten yuan eight dimes. A total of 1,300-1,400 bags were transacted in the public association's division. 2/4 Dutch coarse white also rose five cents to twenty-four yuan four dimes. Transit goods were sixteen yuan two dimes. Taikoo White B Mark Pudong goods were twenty-three yuan and a half, and Puxi goods were twenty-two yuan seven dimes. The aftermarket will be shifted by whether the road can increase in prosperity.</p>

Its purpose is to replace tinplate and thin black iron sheets, etc. Recently, black iron sheets are out of stock and tinplate has risen sharply, so many users have switched to using it. Therefore, the market is stirring, and actual sales are excellent. The market price is around thirty yuan. Yesterday, three to four hundred bundles were sold, mostly purchased by thermos bottle factories. Recently, overseas pricing is 43 yuan 5 dimes per ton (US dollars), which is one yuan higher than before, it is said.</p>

<p>Today is the founding anniversary of the Republic of China, and also New Year's Day of the 28th year. Various sectors of this city, because it is a time of emergency and the national crisis is pressing, have decided to comply with the central government's orders and not hold extravagant celebrations, only holding individual commemorative ceremonies. Various institutions such as customs, post office, courts, the municipal council, and the banking industry are all closed for three days. All groups, schools, companies, commercial firms, neighborhood residents in the city all hang flags to celebrate. At the same time, people from all walks of life, because it is the beginning of the year, have decided to enthusiastically promote the national one-yuan debt repayment movement, in order to win the final victory and complete the great cause of national construction.</p>
<p>Occupational Associations' Announcement to Compatriots</p>
<p>The Shanghai Occupational Associations Federation issued a statement to all compatriots in the city in commemoration of New Year's Day. The original text roughly stated: Since the War of Resistance, more than a year has passed. Today, when this war has reached the second stage, the government has repeatedly encouraged the people to strive for strength and wash away national shame. However, the urban masses still indulge in paper-drunk gold and fans, and are separated from the soldiers fighting on the front lines and the compatriots in the war zone, who are not adequately fed and clothed. There is no comparison between the two. Now that the national masses are launching a debt repayment movement, the urban masses should rise up and lead the way in making donations as an example. They should also base themselves on the meaning of lying on firewood and tasting gall, and strive to achieve the goal of final victory.</p>
<p>Refugee Associations Express Gratitude to All Sectors</p>
<p>The board of directors, committees, treasurers, and secretariat of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association issued a message of thanks to all philanthropists in the city on New Year's Day: Since the establishment of the association, more than two months ago, we have received the support of philanthropists from all walks of life in the city, who have generously donated money, so that the refugees have no fear of freezing and starvation, and society enjoys the blessings of peace. We are deeply grateful for your compassionate benevolence. As the beginning of the year approaches, on behalf of all the refugees, we express our gratitude nine times over.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Municipal Party Headquarters' New Year's Day Message to the Public <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Dear compatriots,</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. As we celebrate this joyous occasion during the second phase of the War of Resistance, although we have no heart for celebration, neither are we in despair. On the contrary, the improvement of the war situation and the active international efforts fill us with boundless excitement. At the same time, we also feel a greater sense of responsibility for the future.</p>
<p>Our compatriots in this isolated island, amidst the relentless wind and rain and the looming shadows of evil from all directions, have been able to firmly grasp their own souls. They have resolutely rejected the temptations of demons and the devourings of giants, and have devoted much effort to activities such as offering savings for festivals, aiding refugees, and collecting winter clothing. This spirit of arduous struggle is truly worthy of praise. However, we must not only focus on this bright side, but also look at the dark corners. The bustling streets, the extravagant spending in entertainment venues, and the overcrowded dance halls and restaurants all reveal that there are still many decadent and degenerate elements who are consuming vast amounts of foreign exchange and wasting a great deal of national strength. Thinking of this fills us with deep regret! However, this precisely tells us that the past efforts of our compatriots in this isolated island are still not enough!</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "The plan for the year lies in the spring." As we usher in this "new beginning and the return of spring to the earth," we list below the work we should strive for in the future, as a goal for all sectors of our compatriots to advance towards.</p>
<p>First: Since the National Army withdrew westward, our compatriots in the business community have never forgotten their responsibilities. In an extremely difficult environment, they have continued to grit their teeth and struggle tirelessly, refusing the enemy and puppet regime's takeover of the municipal business association. Their loyalty and integrity are deeply moving. However, we cannot deny that there are indeed many short-sighted industrialists and businessmen who, blinded by petty profits, are taking advantage of the current situation to sell enemy goods for the enemy, or to establish consumer entertainment businesses. It is not necessary to accuse them of consciously committing the crime of aiding the enemy, even from the perspective of self-interest, this is extremely fragile. Moreover, with the enemy and puppet regime lurking around, arbitrarily exploiting and plundering, they will be unable to escape the impending doom! We must understand that resolutely resisting Japan is to complete the permanent foundation for national construction. The base for the War of Resistance is in the vast interior, especially in the southwest and northwest, where the government has gradually completed transportation construction and is looking forward to investment from the national industrial and commercial circles to develop the inexhaustible resources. Therefore, in the future, compatriots in the industrial and commercial circles should correct their past misconceptions, take on the task of resisting Japan and building the nation, and transfer all resources to the interior as much as possible to start our development work. Only in this way can your funds be safely placed, and your harvests be truly reliable.</p>
<p>Second: In the past year, our compatriots in the labor community have also not abandoned their responsibility to save the country. They have firmly held their original positions, watched the enemy and puppet regime's advances, and although life has been hard, they have still cooperated in a state of labor-management coordination, sharing the same boat and working together in good faith. This spirit of hard struggle is highly commendable. However, we know that there are still many skilled and technical workers who, unable to find work, wander the streets, living a vagrant life. We believe that these lovable workers have a very firm will and will never be tempted by villains to be driven by the enemy and puppet regime. However, as time goes on, they will inevitably be unable to withstand the coercion of hunger and cold, which will lead to unimaginable consequences. Moreover, allowing them to wander around is a loss of national strength. Now, when our southwest and northwest are engaged in economic construction, they urgently need a large number of skilled and technical workers to work. We sincerely hope that the general workers will recognize the situation and stop clinging to this isolated island where livelihoods have been cut off, and consciously move to the interior, where you can get a stable life and will never be disappointed.</p>
<p>Third: Over the past year, our compatriots in the education sector in Shanghai have adhered to the educational principles of the Three People's Principles, planned and managed diligently, and worked tirelessly, ultimately causing the enemy and puppet regime's policy of enslavement to be reduced to nothing. Their achievements are no less than those of the soldiers who killed the enemy on the front lines, and are worthy of being an example for the general public. However, in fact, there are inevitably one or two scoundrels who regard the educational principles promulgated by the country as worthless, or arbitrarily add or delete school subjects, change the course standards set by the ministry, or use outdated teaching materials and prohibit discussion of current affairs. The reason they hold is nothing more than to avoid friction. If this concept is not particularly intentional, it is forgetting the active role of education in the country and society. We hope that in the future, the education sector will, on the one hand, abide by the ministry's rules, strictly follow the law, and engage in the work of enlightenment and guidance, and carry out the task of overcoming the difficulties of the War of Resistance. At the same time, on the other hand, they must cooperate sincerely and jointly exclude those scoundrels who speculate and seek profit, in order to maintain righteousness and not betray the country's educational purpose.</p>
<p>Fourth: Young people are the vanguard of the revolution, the new life of the country, and the construction of society and politics all rely on the driving force of young people. The youth of Shanghai have provided indelible merits in the past and have made the greatest efforts to participate in the work of resisting Japan and building the nation. However, after the National Army withdrew westward, most young people still worked diligently and strived for self-improvement, but a few felt depressed due to the special environment and suffocating atmosphere, and from depression they went astray, indulging in entertainment venues and living a romantic and decadent life. Perhaps they have unspeakable pain, but at least they have made the mistake of not having a clear understanding of reality. We must understand that in this environment, although you are not allowed to do more work against the enemy, it is precisely because of this that you can safely bury yourself in academic research, enrich your knowledge and skills, create a Three People's Principles warrior for the country, and shoulder more arduous and heavier tasks in the future. We hope that in the future, our young compatriots should strive for self-improvement, strictly organize themselves, rectify their spirits, pay attention to scientific cultivation and technical training, and never abandon themselves and become a parasite of the country and nation.</p>
<p>Fifth: Resisting Japan is our means of building the nation, and building the nation is our goal of resisting Japan. We are resisting Japan on the one hand and building the nation on the other. Therefore, the work of building the nation is becoming more urgent and necessary with the progress and success of the War of Resistance. Now, our rear areas are in dire need of general specialized talents, such as doctors, pharmacists, engineers, architects, mechanical scientists, chemists, etc. However, there are many specialized talents idle on the isolated island. How can they not want to dedicate themselves to the country? Some cannot go on expeditions because of family burdens; some are reluctant to move forward because they cannot bear the long journey; some dare not invest in the interior because they are used to urban life. In fact, general technical experts: if your spirit is to have a fulfilling and happy place to live, and if your talents are to have ample opportunities to be utilized, you should abandon this isolated island that is about to become stiff and rush to the interior to create a bright and brilliant future for yourselves and establish immortal merits for thousands of years!</p>
<p>Sixth: Shanghai seems to maintain considerable safety because of its international relations. Therefore, compatriots from all over the occupied areas have flocked here as a refuge, forming today's population expansion and abnormal prosperity on the isolated island. The extravagance and enjoyment of general consumer life makes it hard to believe that this is the life of the Chinese people struggling in wartime. This phenomenon is really terrible! We believe that at this critical juncture when the War of Resistance is entering the second phase, all compatriots, if they cannot go to the interior to actively participate in the War of Resistance, should at least economize on food and clothing to extend their vitality, cultivate morality and study their careers, and cultivate new blood for the country. We must understand that the hardships and burdens of future nation-building work will be ten times greater than today. Not only will a large amount of manpower be needed, but also strong material resources. We hope that the general public will recognize the importance of their responsibilities, deeply self-examine themselves, abstain from all bad habits, eliminate all entertainment and extravagance, and reserve new strength for the country.</p>
<p>Seventh: As for general work, such as the promotion of saving movement and the development of resisting enemy goods movement, all sectors of compatriots need to continue to work hard and mobilize widely to ensure the universality and depth of the movement, so as to achieve complete success. The "One Yuan Debt Repayment Movement" that is now being advocated, various groups are still carefully drafting specific measures and will begin soon. Compatriots from all walks of life should actively contribute and work hard to promote it, to show the spirit of our isolated island compatriots not being isolated and enhance the belief of friendly countries in our assistance. However, the savings for debt repayment should be taken from the savings, because donating legal tender to the country is just a transfer of chips. The national treasury will indeed have a larger income, which can be used to repay foreign debt, but national wealth has not increased, and national strength cannot be said to have increased. Only by using the savings as debt repayment funds can we reduce the country's burden and increase the country's strength. It is hoped that the promotion of the "One Yuan Debt Repayment Movement" will be combined with the "Saving Movement," so as to achieve practical results.</p>
<p>In short: The work we should strive for now is not limited to the above points. The new trends in the future require new efforts. But these are the more practical and more important tasks at present. At the same time, we believe that the enemy will become more fierce and cruel to us because they are sinking deeper and deeper, and the international situation is becoming more and more severe. Especially to Shanghai, they will launch more poisonous claws to plunder and trample, but we are not "afraid." This will be their "last stand." Our victory has come with the warm spring. We must use a more "mournful, more persevering, more practical, more hardworking, and more courageous" mentality and spirit to shatter the enemy's dream of aggression and complete our mission of resisting Japan and building the nation! Wishing you all the best!</p>

The total revenue for 1937 was 342,900,000 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>The figures for various tax revenues in 1938 are compared with those of 1937 below.</p>
<p>Foreign Debt Indemnity</p>

This domestic debt includes three types: the 25th Year Unified Public Bonds, the 25th Year Reconstruction Public Bonds, and the 17th Year Long-Term Financial Public Bonds.</p>
<p>Customs Houses in the Three Northeastern Provinces and War Zones</p>
<p>The portions of the various debts and indemnities guaranteed by customs duties that should have been paid by the customs houses in the three northeastern provinces (including the Dalian Customs House) have never been paid since these customs houses were seized in the summer of 1932. The portions of the various debts and indemnities that should have been paid by the customs houses in other war zones, except for the Jianghai Customs House, which paid 1,181,171.65 yuan in national currency in June 1938, have also never been paid.</p>

<p>According to the Continental Daily, the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, in an effort to obtain approval for American companies to continue to send ships to Ningbo, directly appealed to the Central Government yesterday (30th). Last night, responsible sources stated definitively that the American Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Foreign Ministry of the Central Government in Chongqing to remedy this unfair act because the American Chamber of Commerce had previously failed to send sufficient ships to Ningbo. Responsible sources also confirmed that in the past few weeks, various shipping companies concerned have been vying for new permits, and some companies have closer ties to Zhejiang Province, so American shipping companies may be overlooked. It is expected that new permits for direct shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo will be issued soon after the New Year. Companies from England, Germany, America, Portugal, and Italy are involved in this profitable shipping industry. It is widely believed that Guo Chiping, the newly appointed commander of the Ningbo garrison, will handle the issuance of permits after receiving instructions from the government authorities.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Remembering the Pioneers Who Responded to the National Crisis and Recaptured Rights and Interests: Compatriots from Various Places Gather in Shanghai, and the Iron Bed Business Is Particularly Developed <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are essential elements of our lives. As science becomes increasingly prosperous, we strive for comfort in every way. Taking the bed industry as an example, since the import of foreign copper and iron beds, old-fashioned wooden beds have been increasingly eliminated. Although the public loves the beauty, sturdiness, and durability of copper and iron beds, the huge drain of resources every year is not insignificant. Therefore, for the sake of recapturing rights and interests, domestic manufacturers have established factories to produce their own, and are constantly improving, competing with foreign goods. Among them, the Ximengzi Bed Factory has a long history and leads the bed industry. Its original factory was located on Qiujiang Road in Zhabei, with a large scale, new machines, and exquisite production, which were widely adopted by the public. The distribution office was located at the intersection of Aiduya Road and Guangsi Road to meet market demand. Its staff is knowledgeable in commerce, treats people with kindness and friendliness, and has none of the bad habits of small shop staff who treat customers slowly, so it is particularly loved by the public. After the outbreak of the 813 Shanghai War the previous year, although its original factory was destroyed by artillery fire, fortunately, the machines were moved into the concession beforehand, and a new site was found on Baker Road to revitalize the former business and further reform to meet the needs of the public, in order to achieve the principles of economy, beauty, comfort, and durability, making steady progress, truly adding a touch of color to the bed industry amidst the national crisis.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Yesterday Was the National Calendar's New Year's Eve, the Market Was Stable, All Industries Passed Through Safely, the Silver and Money Industries Were Busy Settling Accounts, and the Exchange of Bills Increased. It Is Determined That They Will Take a Four-Day Holiday Starting Today to Organize Everything. <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the closing day of the Republic of China's 27th year. The silver and money industries rushed to settle accounts, and the bank clearing house specially added an exchange. The market and finance were stable as always, and all industries reported that they had passed through safely. From today, the silver and money industries will take a four-day holiday to organize everything internally. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Busy Settlement of Accounts, Increased Exchange</p>
<p>Yesterday was the National Calendar's New Year's Eve, and the settlement of accounts in the silver and money industries was very busy, especially in the banking industry. The exchange time of the bank clearing house was originally set at 3:30 p.m. once a day. Yesterday, it specially added an exchange at 4:45 p.m., and the exchange of bills, whether remittances or national currency, increased more than double compared to normal days. Each bank extended its office hours internally according to its business situation. Zhejiang Xing, Shanghai, Zhejiang Shi, Jin Cheng, and other banks all worked until late at night.</p>
<p>Four-Day Holiday to Organize Everything</p>
<p>The Silver and Money Industry Association stipulates that member banks and firms will take a four-day holiday starting today to organize everything. Although banks are closed to the public, they will still work internally to rush to settle accounts and will open for business on the 5th. The general closing period for the money industry has been discussed and set for February 18th (i.e., the Lunar New Year's Eve). This year, due to the issue of withholding income tax, a general settlement is being carried out at the end of the National Calendar year. All preparations for the general settlement in the future will be submitted to the next session of the association's executive committee for discussion and decision.</p>
<p>Market Stability, All Industries Pass Through Safely</p>
<p>Since the war, the financial industry has been very stable due to the appropriate handling by the financial authorities and the full support of the four banks of China, China, Transportation, and Agriculture. As for the finance of Shanghai on the isolated island, because each bank and firm has repeatedly strengthened its own reserves, and is particularly cautious about all loans, and various industries within the concession have seen abnormal development, all loans that expired at the end of the year have been recovered as scheduled, which is very different from the end of the National Calendar year last year. Although yesterday was New Year's Eve, the market discount rate remained the same, and all industries reported that they had safely passed through this year-end, and no unfortunate events occurred.</p>
<p>Start Preparing for the General Closing</p>
<p>The general closing period for the money industry and various industrial and commercial industries has been set for February 18th. Now that various industries have safely passed through the end of the National Calendar year, and the end of the agricultural year is approaching, from now on, they will start preparing for the general closing. All loans released by various companies, factories, and firms will be collected by staff separately. Those in other ports will be certified by the municipal chamber of commerce to send staff to collect them. Those in this city will be issued with withdrawal slips and will try to adjust their cash position in order to safely pass through this general closing period.</p>
<h3 id="e97">All Trade Unions in the City Issued a Declaration Denouncing Wang Jingwei's Erroneous Edict, the People's Belief Is Firm, and They Will Never Be Bewitched by It, Vowing to Uphold the War of Resistance With Sincerity and Strive for Victory. <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>(Modern News Agency reported,) The trade unions of various industries in this city stated that Wang Jingwei's talks in Hong Kong, which endorsed the Konoe Declaration and telegraphed Chairman Chiang to seek peace with Japan, were not only absurd and outrageous, but also completely contradictory to his past statements. Such inconsistency is truly shameless. Yesterday, they issued a declaration, strongly denouncing it. The original text reads: The Japanese imperialists' desire to invade and annex our Republic of China,</p>
<p>Their Conspiracy and Ambition</p>
<p>Had long been revealed, and the people of the country were fully aware of it. Since the July 7th Incident, our highest authorities have believed that tolerance has reached its limit and peace has reached a point of despair. Therefore, they resolutely established the national policy of resisting Japan and building the nation, and will not hesitate to make any sacrifices to deal with the enemy. Even if there is only one soldier left, they will resist to the end. Now that the soldiers have entered the second stage, the enemy's domestic economic crisis is becoming increasingly serious, and the consumption of soldiers cannot be replenished. Recently, the attitudes of Britain and the United States have become stronger, and Soviet Russia's aid to China has become more active. Japan is about to fall into the last moment of internal and external difficulties and collapse. Therefore, they have to implement their political conspiracy, spread the air of peace, and Konoe issued nonsense to test our opinion, vainly hoping to</p>
<p>Tempt Us to Surrender</p>
<p>With conditions such as "friendship, anti-communism, and economic cooperation." Our highest leader, Chairman Chiang, saw through the conspiracy and revealed in detail during the Central Memorial Week the Japanese side's ambition to destroy our China and its consistent vicious conspiracy, clearly explaining it. After reading it, the people of the whole country became more confident in the future of the War of Resistance, and were unanimously willing to endure great pain in order to strive for the independent survival of the nation for millions of years. But now that the War of Resistance has turned into a stage of superiority, Wang Jingwei, who is the chairman of the Central Political Committee, quietly left and rashly resigned. The people of the country were deeply suspicious and surprised. Who knew that the news came that Wang had made a reckless statement, believing that Japan's Konoe's declaration was not contradictory, and advocated that our country seek peace with Japan, directly wanting to send our country and nation to</p>
<p>A Region From Which There Is No Return.</p>
<p>His madness and disease are so extreme that it is truly heartbreaking to speak of it. My colleagues in the industrial sector still remember that after the September 18th Incident, Wang was in Guangdong, severely criticizing Chiang Kai-shek's failure to resist. Later, the two sides of Beijing and Guangdong held peace meetings and negotiated cooperation, using the coal industry to unite sincerely and go to the national disaster together. Wang, although he came from northern Guangdong, stayed in Shanghai and was slow to enter Beijing. My comrades in the industrial sector, in order to promote cooperation, elected representatives to visit Wang at his residence on Meierxi Ai Road, asking him to enter Beijing immediately to take charge of the overall plan. Wang Yan saw him and said that Chiang Kai-shek's non-resistance to foreign countries and non-compromise to domestic affairs were the sins of this party. At that time, Wang's anti-Japanese mood was so strong and his advocacy was so intense that he had the intention of forcing Chiang Kai-shek to immediately send troops to resist Japan. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang saw through the overall situation, had a plan in mind, bore the burden of humiliation, and did not act recklessly. On the one hand, he</p>
<p>Buried His Head in Hard Work</p>
<p>And actively prepared, so that he was able to launch a great war of resistance after the July 7th Incident. It is not that today, when the war is progressing fiercely, Wang's words are still in his ears, but he suddenly turns against himself, advocating surrender and peace. What is his intention? It is truly beyond our imagination. In summary, the untrustworthiness of his fallacies has been clearly analyzed by Chairman Chiang in the past. The people of the whole country will not be misled by him. Even if Wang truly changes his allegiance to the enemy, it will not have any impact on our entire nation. Wang's words will only destroy his political life and cut himself off from the people of the country. Finally, my city's industrial sector, after the national crisis, vowed to uphold the leader and uphold the war of resistance with sincerity, in order to strive for final victory. I hereby declare.</p>
<h3 id="e98">British Merchant Ruirong Iron Factory Experiences Labor Strike: Factory Earns Over Two Million in Year-End Profits, Deduction of Year-End Bonuses for Workers Sparks Strike <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Yangshupu British merchant Ruirong Iron Factory (now renamed the United American Iron Factory) has had a prosperous accounting period since resuming work after the war. Due to the issue of deducting year-end bonuses for small steamboat crew members, over one hundred crew members in total felt that their treatment was unfair, leading to a labor strike starting at 1 PM yesterday. There is also a trend of it spreading to other workers, expanding the labor-management dispute. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Renamed and Resumed Work</p>
<p>The Ruirong Iron Factory was established entirely with British merchant capital and is affiliated with the Yesong Iron Factory in Hongkou, the Hefeng Iron Factory in Pudong, the Xiangsheng Iron Factory, and the Dongjiadu</p>
<p>Iron Factory. They all belong to the same company, with strong financial resources and thriving business. During the August 13th Shanghai Battle last year, the Yesong, Hefeng, Xiangsheng, and Dongjiadu factories were simultaneously forced to shut down. Only the Ruirong factory勉强 managed to maintain a small portion of work during the war. After the war shifted west, the Yesong factory was transferred to the British merchant Moller Company and renamed the Moller Shipyard. The Xiangsheng and Dongjiadu factories have not yet resumed work due to environmental reasons. The Ruirong and Hefeng factories have uniformly reorganized internally and are now called the United British Iron Factory, resuming work one after another.</p>
<p>Thriving Business</p>
<p>There are dozens of iron factories (or shipyards) of various sizes opened by Chinese and foreign merchants in Shanghai. After the war, most were forced to close down due to environmental pressures. Therefore, the Ruirong factory's resumption of work purely took advantage of the opportunity, creating a situation of "everyone withering while it alone prospers," a distorted form of development. If various companies' large and small ships were damaged, they all flocked to the factory for repairs. The total number of workers increased from several hundred to over three thousand, divided into two types: subcontracted work and hourly work. One-third of them live in the Yangshupu war zone, and two-thirds live in the two concessions south of the Suzhou River. Currently, the factory is repairing one large Moller Company ship, two small ships, one Asiatic Petroleum Company Fugang ship, one Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. Tonghe ship, one Guisheng ship, one British tugboat, one British warship, and one American warship, with exceptionally busy work.</p>
<p>Unequal Treatment</p>
<p>Yesterday was the year-end closing period. The factory authorities announced that this year's profit was over 2.8 million, exceeding the highest record of income in previous years. The enormous profit was the first time in the factory's history. In previous years before the war, the factory's annual profit was mostly over ten or twenty to thirty thousand. This year's performance exceeded previous years by five or six times or seven or eight times. The year-end bonuses for Chinese and foreign employees were roughly distributed as follows: (1) Western employees received an additional two months' salary, combined with one month's original salary for December, for a total of three months. Chinese employees received an additional one month's year-end salary, for a total of two months. Small steamboat crew members received six days of bonus pay. Other hourly workers received no bonus pay. Before the war, Western employees received a one-month year-end bonus, and this year it was doubled. Chinese employees previously received a half-month year-end bonus, and this year it was also doubled. Small steamboat crew members previously received two weeks' wages as a year-end bonus, but this year it was reduced to six days. Hourly workers previously received one week's wages as a year-end bonus, but this year it was completely cancelled. Therefore, according to the labor side's opinion, they felt a sense of unequal treatment.</p>
<p>Crew Strike</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the factory announced the year-end bonus plan. The small steamboat crew members of the factory immediately expressed their dissatisfaction at 1 PM and raised their demands. In addition to restoring the two-week year-end bonus before the war, they demanded an additional two weeks' bonus, the same treatment as Chinese employees. However, the factory only agreed to add one day to the six-day year-end bonus, for a total of one week's wages. The crew members felt that not only did they not receive additional preferential treatment, but compared to before the war, it was actually reduced by half. Everyone was in an uproar. In an instant, everyone announced a strike. The factory was afraid that they would disrupt order and forced them all to return home. The factory has a total of eleven small steamboats, including the Ganxian, Huining, Fadi, Geli Disi, Jin, Man, Ruirong, Yangshupu, Chuanda, Yesong, and electric welding boats, one dredging boat, three Qiyong boats, and two sampans, for a total of seventeen. All crew members, including captains, chief engineers, sailors, stokers, and cooks, totaling over one hundred people, left the factory at 2 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Likely to Expand</p>
<p>After the crew members went on strike, the factory's attitude was quite tough. Because waterway access was blocked, over twenty factory workers living in the concession (south of the Suzhou River) could not leave the factory after work. They temporarily hired one Moller tugboat and three Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. tugboats to tow barges and transport workers out of the factory. The next three days are New Year's holidays, so it is difficult to know what kind of development will arise. However, the hourly workers of the factory, including foundry workers, coppersmiths, bench workers, lathe workers, pattern makers, carpenters, electricians, pole workers, etc., totaling one thousand four or five hundred people, also have intentions to oppose it because their one-week year-end bonus before the war was also cancelled. It is rumored that they will also demand the restoration of the year-end bonus after work resumes on January 4th. Therefore, labor-management disputes will have a trend of expansion.</p>

<p>After the Ministry of Finance implemented foreign exchange control on March 14th, it restricted the import of non-essential goods and promoted the export of native products. The Central Bank stipulated that it would supply legal foreign exchange to various industries upon application, and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications would handle the sale and settlement of foreign exchange for exported goods. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. Foreign exchange reserves have become increasingly abundant, market prices have remained stable, and the deficit in international trade has decreased. Now, in order to sympathize with merchants and promote the export of native products, the number of goods that should settle foreign exchange is reduced. Exports of goods that have already settled foreign exchange are exempt from export tax. It is approved to be implemented from January 1st of the 18th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1929]. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ten Categories Such as Eggs Are Exempt from Foreign Exchange Settlement</p>
<p>The Ministry stipulates that merchants transporting goods for export, such as tung oil and 23 other types, should sell and settle foreign exchange to the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications to obtain a certificate of purchase of foreign exchange before being allowed to declare them for export. This time, the fifth category, egg products (egg white, egg yolk, frozen eggs), the twelfth category, golden grass hats, the thirteenth category, hair, the sixteenth category, cotton, the seventeenth category, peanuts, the eighteenth category, sesame, the nineteenth category, tobacco, the twentieth category, wood, the twenty-first category, bamboo, and the twenty-second category, almonds, etc., a total of ten major categories, will be temporarily approved for export without settling foreign exchange from January 1st of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1939].</p>
<p>Goods That Should Settle Foreign Exchange Are Exempt from Export Tax</p>
<p>From now on, the goods that should settle foreign exchange are the first category, tung oil, the second category, pig bristles, the third category, cowhide, the fourth category, tea (black tea, green tea, tea bricks), the sixth category, mineral sands, the seventh category,　seeds, the eighth category, hides (sheep, deer, wolf, fox, rabbit, otter), the ninth category, medicinal materials (rhubarb, cassia bark, angelica), the tenth category, wool, the eleventh category, silk, the fourteenth category, ramie, the fifteenth category, sausage casings, and the twenty-third category, duck feathers, etc., for a total of thirteen major categories. Exports of goods that should settle foreign exchange will be approved for exemption from export tax from January 1st of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1939].</p>
<p>Procedures for Obtaining a Certificate of Purchase of Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Any merchant wishing to　export goods should immediately fill out a certificate of purchase of foreign exchange application form in detail at the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications or its entrusted bank in the location of the customs, and if necessary, should find a guarantor and affix a seal on the application form. The application form is in two forms, Chinese and English, each divided into two copies, both with a yellow background and black text. The original will be retained by the bank and　sent to the local Trade Commission or its agent for review. The duplicate must be sent to the head office in Hong Kong for verification. After the Trade Commission has reviewed and approved it, the bank can issue a certificate of purchase of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Exchange of Legal Tender at Foreign Currency Prices</p>
<p>The price of the goods exported by the exporter should be sold to the bank at foreign currency prices in exchange for legal tender. When the bank actually receives the foreign exchange, it should fill out a foreign exchange purchase report. The report is divided into two copies, both with a light green background and black text. The original should be submitted to the local Trade Commission, and the duplicate should be sent to the head office in Hong Kong for record. When filling out the report, each item should be filled out on the back of the retained original application form for verification. At the same time, the certificate previously issued to the exporter should be taken back, cancelled, and filed.</p>
<p>Transit to the Chongqing-Occupied Area</p>
<p>If a merchant transports goods for export, and the goods being transported should settle foreign exchange, but they are not being transported overseas but are being transshipped to the occupied enemy area, the merchant transporting the goods must also handle it in accordance with the method of selling and settling foreign exchange for exported goods. However, if it is indeed transit for domestic sales, it may be approved for transit. The method is as follows: (1) The relevant industry association or chamber of commerce in the place of origin should issue a letter of guarantee, filling in the purpose and quantity of the required raw materials, etc., and after approval by the Trade Commission, a transit permit will be issued. (2) When reporting for transit, the transit permit must be presented to the customs for reporting. (3) If it is discovered that goods reported for transit are still being exported, in addition to the association or　chamber of commerce that issued the letter of guarantee paying the foreign exchange, they will also be subject to administrative sanctions.</p>

<p>The Continental News reports that yesterday (the 30th), British troops and the White Russian team of the International Settlement Merchant Corps were active all day. The search team was also dispatched to search for suspicious people all night the day before and early yesterday morning. Searching pedestrians has also become routine. Most of the search teams carrying out the search work yesterday were the White Russian team and the patrols of the East Yorkshire Regiment. Patrols of the Municipal Police also held guns in their hands in anticipation. The search was conducted throughout the Western District, paying particular attention to the areas where barbed wire was erected at the entrances of various lanes. In the evening, most of the lanes leading to Anhe Temple Road were blocked by barbed wire. The current cooperation plan between the British troops and the White Russian team and the Municipal Police Department was implemented starting Thursday after lengthy consultations between officers of the Municipal Police Department and British troops. Also, Dr. Dunn, a foreign national who was robbed on Columbia Road on Wednesday night, was offered a reward of one hundred yuan yesterday in the hope of recovering the stolen gold watch and gold chain.</p>
<p>Also, the North China Daily News reports that several armored vehicles of the Shanghai International Settlement Merchant Corps joined the special patrols on the roads outside the border in the Western District last night. At the same time, the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council continued to erect barbed wire on a large scale at the entrances of various lanes leading to the Chinese area. Barbed wire was also erected on the open spaces on the roads connecting the concession at the intersections of Yunjie Major Road, Greater Columbia Road, Anhe Temple Road, and other roads. The large-scale patrols and searches on Thursday night have completely eliminated traces of theft on the roads outside the border. No unfortunate incidents occurred after nightfall until dawn. Last night, the patrols and searches were resumed from 6 PM, with "B" Team Municipal Police officer Newkerk in charge of the work. It is expected that special patrols will be conducted again on New Year's Eve.</p>

<p>Huang Xinwen, a native of Jiangbei, 34 years old, lived at No. 5 Jin'anfang, at the intersection of Route de Say-Poo and Route Conty in the French Concession. He worked as a worker at the Qinfeng Cotton Factory at No. 497 Route Conty. At around 1 AM yesterday morning, Huang was working the night shift in the factory when he became lazy and avoided work by sleeping in a pile of cotton clothing. Unexpectedly, a worker was careless and left a fire in the cotton pile, causing it to catch fire and burn. Huang, sleeping in the cotton pile, woke up in a dream from the burning pain on his skin and could not escape, resulting in death in the fire. After people extinguished the flames and dug out Huang's body, his face was burnt beyond recognition and his entire body was charred, a tragic sight to behold. After the French Police Department sent detectives to investigate, the body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch autopsy site.

<p>Wu Kaisheng, a native of Yixing, who once served as the Chinese Minister to Switzerland and is now practicing law in Shanghai, married Ren Bicheng, a Cantonese female doctor, in Shanghai 12 years ago. They lived together and had a daughter. The couple's relationship was very close. Nearly four years ago, Wu fell in love with a woman named Guo, leading to</p>
<p>estrangement between the couple. Ren Bicheng filed a lawsuit for separation against Wu Kaisheng in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court. During the second instance in the Third High Court Branch, both parties reached a settlement, agreeing to a separation of three years, with Wu paying Ren and their daughter 200 yuan per month for living expenses. Now, Ren Bicheng,</p>
<p>believing that the three-year</p>
<p>separation period has expired, has filed another petition with the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court against Wu Kaisheng, requesting an extension of the separation period for three years. She also alleged that the defendant has recently been in love with a woman named Yu and living with her, residing in a Western-style house with a garden, and traveling by car,</p>
<p>enjoying a carefree life,</p>
<p>while refusing to pay the 200 yuan monthly living expenses for the petitioner in one lump sum, but instead paying it separately, causing the petitioner's life to be difficult. She also alleged that the 200 yuan monthly living expenses are not enough to use and requested mediation to order the defendant to increase the expenses, etc. The court has</p>
<p>held a hearing for mediation</p>
<p>once, with both parties represented by their lawyers, claiming that they were conducting mediation outside and requesting a postponement, which was approved. It is now heard that the court has scheduled a hearing for the 6th of this month to continue mediation.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Rampant Bandits: Robbed 27 Families in a Row at Around 2 AM Yesterday <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The strength of maintaining治安 security in the area along the shore of Pudong is exceptionally weak. Because the number of Japanese soldiers is small, they withdraw to the guard posts on the main roads at night and concentrate in various strongholds. The pseudo-"police" in various places are all unarmed and have no defense force. At this time of year when the weather is cold and approaching the end of the year, bandits are even more rampant, and the wind of robbery is becoming more intense. At 2 AM yesterday morning, a large gang of more than 20 bandits, holding 7 or 8 handguns, broke into the residence of Dr. Shen, an old doctor, and the area west of Shen Zhongbo in Shenjia Lane, and began to rob the residents. They left after looting for nearly two hours. The number of households robbed reached as many as 17. Because the villagers are extremely poor, the biggest loss was to a carpenter's house, about 40 or 50 yuan. The rest ranged from 20 to 30 yuan. Among them, the family of a certain surname who operated a摇船 boat happened to have an old woman die of illness, and the corpse was placed on a door panel because they had not yet purchased a coffin for burial. Because the family was poor, the son of the deceased only had a 10 yuan banknote in his hand at the time. When he saw the bandits coming, he quickly hid the banknote under the straw mat on the corpse, but it was also found, resulting in no money for burial, a very tragic situation. The place is not far from the Japanese military at Hentang Bridge. They heard the sound, but because it was night, they ignored it. A month ago, a certain milk shed in nearby Shenjia Lane was also robbed. After reporting to the Japanese military, the person in charge was ordered to kneel on the ground for several hours. Therefore, all the households robbed yesterday did not dare to report it.</p>

<p>Mr. Huang Yuqi, manager of the Huizhong Bank in this port, is an intelligent, capable, generous, and loyal person. Since becoming a member of the rescue association, despite the bank's expanding business and preparations for the opening of a branch on Shilu Road, he has still spared no effort to solicit donations from all walks of life. He recently decided to write to the rescue association, suggesting new ways to raise relief funds and taking the lead in pledging donations as an initiative. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Recently, he adopted two refugees and, in view of the successive approach of Christmas and New Year's Day, many people in Shanghai indulge in the extravagant lifestyle. In addition to exerting efforts to persuade and solicit donations from relatives and friends, he also wrote to Mr. Lin Kanghou, director of the association, appealing for fellow citizens in distress. The original letter is recorded as follows: (omitted above) The north wind is getting stronger, and the winter god is raging. We are wearing heavy coats and sitting around the stove, but we still cannot bear the cold. Those wailing disaster victims are sleeping in the streets and ditches, unable to eat when hungry, and unable to wear warm clothes when cold. Are we uniquely blessed by heaven, while they are uniquely stingy? It is only because of the war that陵园 the cemetery has been turned to ashes, relatives have been separated, and the tragedy and injustice in the world are no greater than this. Since the citizens' group of this association advocated the method of adopting refugees, 群山响 the mountains responded. Yuqi is barely able to make ends meet, but he is not afraid to be behind others in doing good. Therefore, he saved the expenses that should have been spent on Christmas and adopted two refugees, just to fulfill his duty to the world. It is even more permissible to spend New Year's Day. On the night of celebration, many people indulge in extravagant lifestyle. According to reports, Japanese dancers regard Shanghai as the best place to seek a living, and they are coming to Shanghai one after another. Although there may be other backgrounds, the debauchery of a certain social class in Shanghai is an undeniable fact. It is believed that entertainment during peaceful times and acting on the spot are originally not impossible, but how can it be reconciled with the miserable lives of refugees? The heart of compassion is in everyone. The cost of one night of celebration, calculated at 30 番 an average, can maintain the lives of 25 refugees for one month. Those who give do not care, and those who receive are as grateful as if they were reborn. Moreover, there are many who spend more than this amount. On the eve of New Year's Day, I would like to appeal for fellow citizens in distress. I dare to ask you to open your benevolent bags, save unnecessary consumption, and relieve the distress of the refugees. Yuqi is very fortunate, and the refugees are very fortunate (omitted below).</p>

<p>At the Tongshang Transportation Company located at No. 33, Lane 2, De'an Lane, North Route du Lieutenant Petiot, around 6:30 PM yesterday, six or seven robbers suddenly broke in and committed a robbery. All the robbers were armed with pistols, forcing the employees to hand over their valuables. Because the employees had limited savings, the robbers' desires were not satisfied. Therefore, they turned to Peng Yangzheng, a 26-year-old accountant from Suzhou working at the company, coercing him to hand over the key to the safe. Peng deliberately prevaricated and refused for a long time, which angered the robbers. They used a pistol butt to strike his head several times, causing his skin to break and bleed, and he cried out in pain. The robbers became anxious and fled, disappearing without a trace. Afterwards, other employees reported the incident to the responsible police station and summoned an ambulance to take Peng to the hospital. Fortunately, his injuries were minor, so he was discharged after being bandaged. As for the losses incurred, they were also minimal. The police are currently pursuing the robbers.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Case of Refugees Beaten to Death in Refugee Shelter: Police Lawyer States the Facts of the Case, Saying That the Defendants Are Inhuman and Should Be Severely Punished According to Law <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The 42nd Refugee Shelter in Fahua Town, Hongqiao, is under the jurisdiction of the Pudong Building Branch of the Shanghai Charity Organizations Federation. Shen Zhiguang from Changzhou served as the director, while Song Meixi from Ningbo, Cao Linsen from this county, Cai Zuying from Pudong, and Zhao Weilian from Shaoxing served as deputy directors, assistants, and inspectors. Shen and others were originally refugees in the shelter themselves, but were able to fill these positions through the recommendation of influential people. However, Shen and others did not sympathize with the suffering of the refugees, but took the opportunity to engage in mutual fraud, deducting the refugees' food and selling it privately to enrich their own pockets. Because refugee Zhang Boyuan (50 years old) from Baoshan leaked the secret and reported it to the higher authorities, on the 3rd of this month, they subjected Zhang to private torture and beatings, leaving him covered in wounds. They also threatened him with words, intending to send him to the puppet organization "Dadao Municipal Government" under the guise of false accusations to be subjected to more severe punishment. Zhang was afraid and scaled the wall to escape on the evening of the 4th, but eventually died on the way due to his severe injuries, taking only a few steps. The incident was discovered by Liu Shaokui, Chief Inspector of the Public Concession Criminal Investigation Department, and Detectives Song Bingzheng and Xie Futang, who arrested Shen and the other four people and handed them over to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. The details have already been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide of the Special First Court, accompanied by Clerk Ding Zhongnan, opened a criminal court and continued the interrogation. The police lawyer stated that the police are now prosecuting the defendants based on Article 278 of the Criminal Law for the crime of causing death through injury, Article 336 of the same law for the crime of embezzling public property held for public benefit, and Article 305 of the same law for the crime of obstructing freedom. He also stated the facts of the case, stating that since the defendants took control of the 42nd Refugee Shelter, they did not think of the suffering of the refugees who were displaced, homeless, and ruined, and give them appropriate comfort, but instead implemented various abusive policies, reducing and deducting the daily rations that the refugees were entitled to. The remaining grain was sold to others, and the illegal profits obtained were distributed equally. On the night of November 9, they secretly… how to embezzle the milk sent by the Gao San Branch, but this was known by refugees Zhang Boyuan and Xie Qiusheng, who believed that Shen and others should not have done this. Therefore, they jointly went to the Cilian Branch to report. The first decision was ineffective, and the second decision was still ineffective. So they sent a letter to the branch and the general association to report. This decision had an effect, and the Cilian Branch sent people to investigate. Shen and others heard the news and transported the deducted grain overnight to an opium den in nearby Hexing Lane (which has now been seized by the police, including fifty or sixty dan of white rice and soybeans). At the same time, they hated the informants and investigated the result. In the residence of the deceased Zhang Boyuan, they searched for the draft of the reporting letter and a roll of adhesive tape, and then accused Zhang of stealing the adhesive tape. They tied Zhang and his son Zhang Aiyi with ropes and hung them on the wall posts in the shelter, and then subjected them to beatings for two hours before releasing them. They were then ordered to point out accomplices, but because Zhang could not point them out, he was beaten again. Seeing that Zhang had already been seriously injured, they ordered him to go to the bedroom to recuperate, and at the same time threatened to accuse him of false accusations to the "Dadao Municipal Government" and make him suffer more severe punishment. Zhang was shocked when he heard this, and on the night of the 4th, he planned to escape from the tiger's mouth. However, because the gate of the shelter was guarded by inspectors, it was difficult to leave safely. He had no choice but to stack two tables high with his son, escaped through the window onto the roof, but eventually died because of the combination of injury and fear, dying before he had walked a mile. Zhang's son Aiyi, because his old father was dead and had no home to return to, had no choice but to return to the shelter. Shen and others saw that the matter had become serious, and in order to quell the matter, agreed to continue to accommodate Zhang Aiyi. At the same time, Zhang Aiyi raised funds to buy a coffin for his father. After Zhang Boyuan was beaten, Xie Qiusheng also escaped and reported to the branch, but because he had nowhere to live outside, he returned to the 42nd Refugee Shelter. Because Xie was recommended by the Changzhou Fellow Villagers Association, the association urged the association to force Xie to write a letter of repentance before allowing him to be accommodated. After the Cilian Association heard the report, it immediately sent people to investigate and confirmed that it was true. The branch chairman Ji Yanfang reported to the police, and the defendants were detained. This is the fact of the matter, and Shen and others also have accomplices Gu Siyi, Bao Yuheng, and Gao Junfu, who have fled after hearing the news. The defendants have already confessed to deducting the refugees' food at the police station and have written confessions. As for the point of beating Zhang Boyuan to death, it can also be proven by Zhang's son Aiyi, Xie Qiusheng, and refugee Gu A'er. According to the circumstances of this case, the defendants took advantage of their positions to deduct the refugees' food and privately tortured and injured others, resulting in death. They are truly inhuman and lawless. If they are not severely punished, how can we warn the future and restore people's hearts? Therefore, the court should severely punish them according to law. Although this case still needs to be investigated further, please schedule another hearing in two weeks after the interrogation. Afterwards, Xia Huanxin, the representative of the Cilian Branch, testified about the reporting of fraud by the deceased and the investigation by the association. Zhang Aiyi also testified in detail about the beginning and end of his father's beating, how the defendants acted at the time, how he was beaten at the same time, and how his father escaped over the roof. After Judge Feng Shide verified the confession, he interrogated the other witnesses and the defendants and announced that the hearing would be adjourned for two weeks in accordance with the police's request.</p>

It is reported that the total amount of living expenses for refugees sponsored by all walks of life, both received and unreceived, has reached more than 100,000 yuan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Situation</p>

<h3 id="e118">Estimated Silver Reserves in China: 690 Million Yuan, Silver Reserves in the United States: 84 Million Gold <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Since the war of resistance, according to an economist's estimate, China still has 690 million yuan in silver reserves. This figure was obtained based on statistics of China's silver imports and exports from 1888 to 1938, a period of fifty years. Moreover, the amount of legal tender issued at the end of November of the 26th year of the Republic of China was 160,346,900 yuan, and the amount issued in May of the 27th year was 170,532,000 yuan, that is, an increase of 10,200,000 yuan from November of the previous year to May of this year. The amount of US dollars in the United States, according to reports as of the end of June of the 27th year, was still 84 million US dollars. In November of the 26th year, China originally had 84 million US dollars in the United States. During June of the 27th year, 63 million US dollars were used, and the sale of 140 million ounces of silver replenished the amount of 84 million US dollars. China's war of resistance expenditure is at most 5 million gold yuan per month, and the US dollars in the United States are a reserve for foreign exchange, so the value of legal tender in foreign exchange will fluctuate between the current exchange rate and will not have a major rise or fall. Furthermore, after the implementation of the legal tender policy, the national financial situation was very stable. Although the Japanese side repeatedly conspired to sabotage it, it was ultimately ineffective. Therefore, even if the war of resistance is extended for several years, the legal tender reserve and the current exchange rate will not be affected in any way.</p>

For several years, under the planning and management of Mr. Tang Wenjin, the director of the office, the business has been extremely developed.

It is reported that the office's business is progressing rapidly and the office space is insufficient, so it will be moved to No. 1086 Jing'an Temple Road (that is, the intersection of Gordon Road) on January 5th of the 28th year, where it will operate as usual.

<p>To the esteemed editor,</p>
<p>I recently read your newspaper's report on the 26th of this month, in the section titled "Shanghai West Gambling Dens Gradually Declining," which mentioned "Xinji Entertainment Club, located at the former site of the Times Middle School on Route Dufour," and "Yifeng Entertainment Club, located at No. 8 Yifeng Lane on Route Dufour," both marked with the words "Xia Shu Fang Fa Biao." I was quite surprised after reading it. I have been working at Xingyu Cotton Mill, Dongxing Oil Mill, Yida Weaving Mill on Singapore Road, and Qinfeng Copper Pipe Factory on Route Robert for many years and have never interfered in outside affairs. Therefore, I am writing to request a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>— Geng</p>
<p>According to general custom, at the end of the year and the beginning of the new year, there is bound to be a "bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new" activity. However, this kind of "bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new" activity is different in form and meaning from the "bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new" in the official circles of prostitutes. Prostitutes, under the direction of "madams," send away old lovers and welcome new ones, with the aim of "money"; subordinates bow and scrape to "superiors" for promotions and transfers, for the sake of "rice bowls." As for the "bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new" of ordinary people during the New Year, it is a progressive phenomenon with positive significance. For example, businessmen conclude the business of one year, calculate the profits and losses of the store, and determine the business policy for the coming year, whether to tighten or expand; tightening to the extreme or expanding to the peak must be based on the calculation of business; this settling of old accounts and this determination of new policies illustrate the progressiveness and activeness of this phenomenon. Therefore, ordinary people have different views of the New Year, some in joy and some in distress.</p>
<p>Friends who have failed in business and are in difficult circumstances have no good feelings about the New Year; they only have jealousy and annoyance. For example, if a store finds out at the end of the year that it has lost one million in capital, eighty in personnel, and its assets have been exhausted, and the shareholders are complaining, then the manager, assistant manager, etc., will certainly not be happy when they encounter the New Year, only sad. But when a person is extremely bored, he often has a reverie and makes a fantasy. Although modern times are scientific, he will also be superstitious about "gods," so there will be an action to "seek the direction of the God of Joy," hoping to meet the "God of Joy" when "seeking," to relieve him of his old difficulties and give him a new happiness.</p>
<p>The manager and assistant manager of a certain store are now in all kinds of difficulties and are thinking of "seeking the direction of the God of Joy," but they don't know where the God of Joy is? They ask the fortune-teller, but the confused fortune-teller only vaguely says southwest and northwest, without a definite answer. This makes them have to mess around blindly!</p>
<p>However, we can tell the manager and assistant manager of that store: this year the God of Joy is in the east, hurry back!</p>
<h3 id="e133">New Year Musings <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Tong Er</p>
<p>According to the customs of our hometown, during the New Year, the whole family must be reunited. On New Year's Eve, we worship ghosts and gods, and offer sacrifices to ancestors; we also gather the whole family and eat a hearty New Year's dinner. — If any children are guests in other places and cannot rush home, an empty bowl and chopsticks must be placed on the table for them, as if to reserve a seat for them. This way of inviting a living person is a bit like the way of worshiping the dead, but people are not taboo about it. Soldiers and poets may not want a home, right? But they are all ordinary people, with an unusually deep sense of family, and an empty bowl and chopsticks must also be made to participate in this annual "family reunion."</p>
<p>Of course, this refers to the Lunar New Year; the Gregorian New Year has almost nothing to do with them. Because they are all "foolish people," and most of them are lagging behind in "political awareness."</p>
<p>However, I think: human life is limited, and at the end of the old year and the beginning of the new year, whether it is relatives and friends, they naturally think of each other and try to get together. It is very much in line with human feelings and is not something to be laughed at. — Today is already New Year's Eve, and there may not be a New Year's dinner to eat, but at the end of the year, it is cold, and I suddenly feel a bit "reluctant to part with" and miss the friends who were separated during the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Because I have lived in Shanghai for several years, I have gradually become acquainted, and I might as well be open and honest. In addition to "resisting Japan" and "saving the country," there are many friends with whom I can talk about private matters. However, since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, more than half of them have disappeared. Some of them have no way to save the country, but they are also forced by hunger and cold, so they have to be outdated and quietly go back to their hometowns to "retire." After "retiring" for more than a year, they have become "plagued with diseases and confused," and their letters are full of complaints and "mother-in-law" spirit, but they still have no way to think about it. Some of them were sent away in a hurry after Shanghai was given the "isolated island" nickname, with a kind of emotion made up of grief, fear, and nostalgia… They traveled to Hong Kong, Wuhan, Changsha, Guilin, Chongqing, or went far to the northwest, working for the Anti-Japanese War and breathing free air, but suffering from displacement and the threat of death. Some of them drifted away and there was no news. Are they alive as soldiers, or have they already shed blood as martyrs? — I do not know. Some of them did die of disease in the middle of the Anti-Japanese War without saying a word. Oh, yes, there is another friend who I have not forgotten. He jumped into the sea in the summer. He was not a soldier, but his death was indeed because of the Anti-Japanese War. …</p>
<p>I miss these friends one by one.</p>
<p>Of course, it is not just friends who have been separated in the war. "The fields are desolate after the war, and flesh and blood are scattered on the roads." I think that there are not many people who can sit around the New Year's Eve dinner this year with a full table and no empty seats. I am also very respectful of a person who can be single-minded and only think about the Anti-Japanese War, the soldiers on the front line, and the people in the rear. As for not thinking about tea and rice, opening a melon and feeling the pain of the broken country, eating meat and having the idea of being in the hands of a butcher, I am also extremely respectful. But I don't think there are many such supermen. With delicious dishes and fragrant wine laid out, but with a table full of empty bowls and chopsticks, ordinary people are probably inevitably a little disappointed, right? Speaking of myself alone, even in such an "extraordinary period," I still do not forget "personal feelings" and often think of some things that have nothing to do with the national economy and people's livelihood or the state of the world. This sometimes seems to make me feel a little "dangerous," but there is no intention of regretting it, even at this time of bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new. At this moment, thinking of those separated friends, I also have a very leisurely and longing feeling.</p>
<p>I think, if one day, the Anti-Japanese War is won, the drums cease, and everyone suddenly reunites, what a thrilling scene it would be! — I cannot imagine it, but I am sure that there will be such a day. And that day must be the birthday of China's rebirth. At that time, let us have an unprecedented and happy New Year again.</p>
<h3 id="e134">After the Rain, the Sky Clears <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Tian</p>
<p>Chapter 1: The One-Armed Elder Organizes a Free Village, the Twin Daughters Pay Respects at the Martyrs' Tomb</p>
<p>"City wind and rain near Double Ninth Festival," this timing will not be wrong. This time, the rain has been falling for more than ten days, making people feel a bit dull. But today it is clearing up, and the sky is free of all the foolish clouds; the air has also become clear and refreshing; the birds are in the branches, in groups, tweeting pleasant songs; the flowers are in front of the steps and fences, and although they have been exposed to rain and frost, they also emit various lovely colors. "It's really a good day!" Everyone said so when they woke up. Because that day was the National Day Double Tenth Festival of the Republic of China in the fortieth year, the clouds and fog were completely swept away, the weather was clear, and everyone was cheering. Also, because China had been fighting hard for a long time, and the wounds had not been healed, it was not until recent years that it had finally taken a breath. Therefore, on this anniversary, we want to celebrate the day greatly. In addition to the government's ceremonies in the capital, such as military parades, sacrifices to the tombs of fallen soldiers, and international banquets, it is also allowed to spread to the people. Even in a small village, they are also happily celebrating the National Day. Now I will talk about a village not far from Suzhou, near the Sujia Railway, called Free Village. This village is a new village, and there are now one hundred and forty or fifty families there. And the people managing the village government there, because the number of people moving in is gradually increasing, have also opened up a lot of places and built many houses. The scenery in the village is also quite good, with sparse willows and small bridges, surrounded by mountains and embracing water, and there are also several different styles of houses. The equipment in the village is also very complete, because China has been working hard on construction in recent years and is willing to pay attention to local autonomy. Therefore, all villages can manage their own hometown affairs, and the former system of local tyrants and evil gentry has been completely broken. Local people have public morality and legal order, so it is much easier to handle things. In that village, there is a small school, named "Free Village Elementary School," with about two hundred students. Originally, this school not only accommodates the children of this village, but also the children of neighboring villages come to attend. Although it is an elementary school, the level is about the same as the second year of junior high school before the war. The most wonderful thing is that the principal of this elementary school only has one arm, and people call him the one-armed principal. Although he only has one arm, that arm still commands as he wishes and does not feel inconvenient. However, the clothes he wears still have two sleeves, but one sleeve is empty and fluttering, just a sleeve without an arm.</p>
<h3 id="e135">"Oath" "Hope" <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>It's the beginning of another year, and as usual, we should write some words like "oaths" and "hopes." This "annual routine" has not changed to this day.</p>
<p>If someone were to "settle" these "oaths" and "hopes" at the end of the year, this account would seem very difficult to explain.</p>
<p>But this year should be an exception. Seeing the blood-red characters on the calendar, thinking that this should be exchanged for the lives of tens of millions of people, this bright red color is precisely the blood of our compatriots who sacrificed under the mad invasion of the Fascists. At the same time, it also symbolizes the brilliant flowers that reopen on the scorched earth.</p>
<p>On this first day of another year, we should make an "oath" - to continue fighting until we reach the shore of light! We should "hope" - that every descendant of the Yellow Emperor cannot accept the absurd and suicidal "peace proposal"!</p>
<h3 id="e136">Anecdotes of Shanghai <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Hangxie Jizhu</p>
<p>Happy New Year</p>
<p>Within the scope of Shanghai anecdotes, today we should be talking about New Year customs, especially the evolution of New Year customs over the past few decades. However, the author has no interest in such things. Unfortunately, today's "Anecdotes" can only be changed into "Miscellaneous Anecdotes" in essence.</p>
<p>I remember last year's New Year, just after our army moved west and the capital was lost in succession, the sea was full of rumors and scares, which almost became the most terrifying place. The joy of the New Year was unspeakable. Now it has only been a year, and the situation has changed greatly. The Japanese army is stuck in the mud, sinking deeper and deeper. Since our army withdrew from Wuhan, the Japanese have not only made no progress, but have also suffered repeated defeats. Their anxiety and panic can be seen at any time and in any place. And our situation is becoming more and more favorable. Now that the New Year has arrived and the spring is coming, all Chinese people should have this feeling.</p>
<p>However, this year's New Year is still in the midst of a bitter battle. It is best to wait for the victory to come before enjoying entertainment to the fullest. Since victory is in sight, we have no choice but to hope that the people of the country will continue to make the final effort. If so, then in the future, when the Anti-Japanese War is won and the country is built, talking about today's Shanghai anecdotes will be even more enjoyable and will remind the readers' spirit.</p>
<p>I have already said that the victory of our Anti-Japanese War is predictable, and we only need to make the final effort. What should be the direction of this effort? In principle, it is nothing more than carrying forward the great spirit of the Anti-Japanese War, so that the road to victory in the Anti-Japanese War can be reached as soon as possible. Because today's work, although it is becoming more and more profound due to the development of the Anti-Japanese War, still makes people feel insufficient.</p>
<p>For example, fighting the Anti-Japanese War to the end, and that the Anti-Japanese War cannot be won without fighting to the end, our Chairman Chiang has repeatedly said it, and the people of the whole country also deeply believe that there is no other way. However, Jingwei and his ilk actually clamored for peace, and their absurdity is becoming increasingly absurd. Although we dare not say today what background Mr. Wang's words contain, the fact that his words are inappropriate and harmful to the Anti-Japanese War is obvious. This kind of statement will also have an impact on many wavering elements. This is why, when I congratulate you on the New Year today, I have to hope that you will pay special attention, work hard in all aspects, and eradicate it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the soldiers on the front line are fighting bloody battles, and the refugees in the rear are begging everywhere. The country's various implementations are especially looking forward to a strong economy. All of these things are related to the future of the Anti-Japanese War. I dare to appeal to you, the readers, as a national citizen. During the New Year, there is usually a lot of waste. This kind of waste is really inappropriate today. I hope that you can save money as much as possible and donate the savings to the country, to the soldiers on the front line, and to the refugees in the rear. I also hope that you can solicit donations in various ways so that you can gather small contributions to make a big contribution. This is also a way to speed up the success of the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Other things that should be done are probably well known to the readers, so I will not elaborate on them. In summary, my personal hope is that you, the readers, will take advantage of this New Year opportunity, follow the instructions of our highest authorities, implement thrift, donate to the country, firmly believe in your own victory in the Anti-Japanese War. Let this customary New Year create new ideas in history, and make the New Year's life also become Anti-Japanese War-oriented.</p>

<h3 id="e137">New Year's Message <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Today is New Year's Day of the 28th year of the Republic of China. First of all, I would like to say "Happy New Year!" to all of you readers! In fact, with the national crisis at hand, when we think of the millions of soldiers who are fighting bloody battles and the countless suffering compatriots in the war zone, who are all living in tragedy, readers, please close your eyes and think quietly, and you will surely have unlimited feelings and your blood will boil!</p>
<p>The citizens of Shanghai, at this critical moment of national crisis, are still living in peace and contentment, singing and dancing, seeking temporary safety. To put it bluntly, it is truly a serious sin! But let's get back to the point. The citizens of Shanghai, who live on an isolated island, are busy all day long, and their spirits are inevitably exhausted. To adjust this depressed life and restore that tired spirit, it is naturally necessary to have proper entertainment.</p>
<p>As the seasons change, we also have to have a minimum hope for the entertainment industry at sea at the beginning of this year, as a criterion for this year's progress. First: I hope that the authorities in the entertainment industry will not be overly profit-driven, but will have a broader vision and think about the audience. For example, how can the equipment be made satisfactory to the audience? How can entertainment indirectly benefit the entire nation? Second: I hope that employees in the entertainment industry, in terms of directing and performing, will pay attention to the great teachings of loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness. They should spread new ideas and instill new knowledge to achieve the effect of popular education. Third: I hope that people who love entertainment will recognize their own positions and not engage in excessive or unreasonable entertainment. And when spending money, they must think of the situation of our nation and donate as much as they can to fulfill their national obligations. For example, the "One Yuan Debt Repayment Movement" and "Relief for Refugees" are opportunities for everyone to serve at the moment.</p>
<h3 id="e138">About Dr. Mei Lanfang <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Ni Qiuping</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Dr. Mei is the King of the Performing Arts. Some people say: Mei Lanfang should not be called the King of the Performing Arts. People who say this kind of thing have some prejudice. In terms of fame, the whole world knows. In terms of singing skills, acting skills, and appearance, who can compare with him? Why isn't he the King of the Performing Arts? Are you the King of the Performing Arts?</p>
<p>At home, the servants all call him "Master." His secretary, Mr. Li Feishu, calls him "Sir." Some friends in the performing arts also call him "Boss Mei." Some people also call him "Mr. Mei." Those old friends all call him "Wanhua." The foreign teacher who taught him English called him Dr. Mei. The doctor always has a kind and gentle expression when accepting many different titles. He always bows ninety degrees to friends, and then shakes hands. His attitude is excellent. People only know that he looks good on stage, but they don't know that he is also kind and natural in ordinary times. That kind of sincere look is deeply imprinted in people's minds. Everyone wants to see him often.</p>
<p>When he sings at home, it is incredibly loud, and the eardrums are almost damaged. I would rather have my ears deafened by him all at once, because it is really too beautiful.</p>
<p>In that room that is a reception room but is actually a study, it is full of a thousand or so foreign books, all of which are famous works of literature and drama. One moment a teacher comes to teach painting, and another moment a foreign teacher comes to teach English. Fan paintings and small vertical scrolls are all what people come to "respectfully request." When the fame is big, this is a bit difficult to handle - you have to paint, but there is not enough time. If you don't paint, you offend people. Dr. Mei sometimes frowns slightly, expressing that there is no way to handle it. But in the end, he paints them one by one and sends them away.</p>
<p>Last year's gunshots in Shanghai were too loud. We were talking together when suddenly there was a loud explosion. My heart was so frightened that I stood up involuntarily. But the doctor said: "It's okay. Don't be afraid, don't be so timid." I felt that Mei Lanfang was simply not the King of the Performing Arts. What is he? I think he is the God of Peace. This is our East Asian God of Peace.</p>
<p>"Following good advice" is just a saying, who has ever put it into practice? The doctor has a bit of this meaning, so he is making progress every day. I heard him sing "Life and Death Hatred," and there were two places that were slightly off. — One place is the second six "Zhang Thief angrily sold the slave," the "jiang" is not as good as singing loudly. One place is the fourth level tune "It is good to arrange for a single death in the Yellow Spring," the words "Yellow Spring" are too far apart. I am a person who doesn't know what is high or low, so I told him at the time that these two places could be improved. Everyone next to him must have thought, what are you, dare to tell me this, you are not worthy. The doctor is excellent, he said: "Yes, that's right. I really have to change it." The last time he went on stage, he really changed it. This kind of thing is really not something that ordinary people can learn, so in addition to admiring his art, I especially admire his knowledge. This is true knowledge, and I have not seen a trace of it.</p>
<p>He is incredibly enthusiastic about his friends. He is usually very frugal with himself and calculates even the cost of opening an electric light. Should he open it or shouldn't he? But he really helps people. As long as they ask him and it is reasonable, he will give as much as he can. He can be regarded as responsive. Last year, when the North was in chaos, the performing arts industry also temporarily stopped performing. Master Yao (Yufu) wrote to say that some colleagues were so poor that they had no way to live. He sent a quick letter with a donation of 5,000 yuan. In the past, he also subsidized the elderly who had no food every month. The doctor is really a great philanthropist and a living Buddha in this kind of place. You think he treats ordinary friends like this. (Writing this reminds me of Mr. Xu Muyun, who said in this magazine that he did not know his father's name, which is really a bit that.)</p>
<p>We usually haven't seen the doctor, so we thought we didn't know what kind of person he was. When you get to know him, you know that he is a kind and peaceful gentleman, and you will never see him speaking harshly. He is full of joy, as innocent and lively as a child, and as kind as an elder. I think Dr. Mei is really an extraordinary person.</p>
<p>Since Dr. Mei performed in Hong Kong, he has been living there as a recluse. Some people say that he will never sing again, which has worried many fans of Mei. Among my friends, there is Mr. Yang Wannong, who can imitate both singing and recitation to the point of being indistinguishable from the real thing. In terms of determination, he can be regarded as Mr. Shen Bonian of Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Discussing Radio Plays <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Dabei</p>
<p>Radio plays, also known as broadcast dramas, are stage plays broadcast through radio. In various European and American countries, since radio became widely popular, many drama enthusiasts have used radio to experiment with various methods of broadcasting stage plays. There are specialized books and newspapers dedicated to the creation, performance, and dubbing of radio plays, providing a platform for fellow artists to publicly discuss them. As a result, there are many broadcast drama groups, and playwrights, actors, and dubbing technicians who emerge in response to the times each possess their own unique talents, diverging from stage play writers, actors, and stage design technicians. Their goal is to allow the vast public who cannot afford to attend theaters to appreciate stage plays on the streets, at the end of alleys, and even farmers in remote rural areas to fully enjoy the beautiful fruits of dramatic art through the magic of radio.</p>
<p>The supreme authority of radio plays lies in their ability to absorb listeners without limit, which is vastly different from any form of theater, which is restricted by the capacity of the stage and theater and cannot arbitrarily absorb an excessive number of audience members. It does not require a stage, lights, scenery, and even street posters, flyers, or newspaper advertisements, because the promotional power of radio broadcasting can surpass the promotional power of any printed matter.</p>
<p>Although the progress of radio plays is very rapid (in China, it can be said that in the past seven years, it has only declined and not progressed, because the friends who "rely on their mouths for a living" pay too little attention to this emerging art, only knowing how to use it to help them "eat," and are unwilling to use their brains to come up with new ways to "eat" more "rice"). However, its shortcomings are visible to everyone. That is, it can only be heard and not seen—just as silent films in the silent era could only be seen and not heard, causing the same sense of deficiency.</p>
<p>I believe that this shortcoming will soon be remedied by some radio scholars and inventors. However, radio plays at the current stage also have their own special flavor, which is that they can allow each listener to listen quietly and think silently in the place where they are standing or sitting, imagining beautiful scenes that cannot be created by any grandly equipped stage, and expressions that cannot be made by any greatly cultivated actor. What is particularly valuable is that they are not subject to the sense of the crowd that is unavoidable in the theater. That is, the psychology of radio listeners is individual rather than collective, so the depth of impression is definitely not something that any form of theater can achieve.</p>
<h3 id="e140">New Year and Entertainment <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Xitong</p>
<p>Today is the first day of the Lunar New Year, and the editor wants me to say a few words. Unfortunately, Lou Zikuang's "Customs of the Chinese New Year" and Zhang Cixi's "Beijing Seasonal Customs" have already been donated to the school library, so I have to make do with the meager materials I have on hand.</p>
<p>Entertainment and drama, like many things, flourished in the Song Dynasty, so I will start from the Song Dynasty. In the Northern Song Dynasty, there was Meng Yuanlao's "Tokyo Dream Record." Volume 10, on New Year's Eve, records the Nuo ritual, saying, "The imperial city's close affairs officials and various banzhi play with masks and embroidered painted clothes, holding golden spears and dragon flags." This is quite related to the facial makeup and costumes in later dramas.</p>
<p>There are three records from the Southern Song Dynasty. Wu Zimu's "Dream Liang Record," Volume 1, has entries for "New Year's Day" and "Lantern Festival." It says, "Let's talk about the dance troupes. There are dozens of societies such as Qingyin, Eyun, Diaodao, Bao Lao, Hu Nu, Liu Gun, Qiao Sanjiao, Qiao Yingjiu, Qiao Qinshi, Jiao Chui Jia'er, Shinu Chu Ge, Zhuguo Chao, Zhuma'er, Cun Tianle, Shengui, and Shizhai Lang. There are also Qiao Zhaichun, Han Longchuan, Tiding, Bao Lao, Tuo Xiangshe, and the twenty-four puppet troupes in Sujia Alley in Guanxiangkou. Their costumes are bright and beautiful. The young female puppets wear flowers and pearl and jade crowns, and their waists are slender and graceful, just like women." Zhou Mi's "Wulin Old Events," Volume 2, also has entries for "First Month" and "Lantern Festival." The list of "large and small puppet shows" is very long. In addition to the above, there are also Chacha Gui, Li Dakou, He Fengnian, Chang Hu Lian, Tu Ji, Chi Sui, Da Han'er, Da Dan, Ma Pozi, Kuaihuo Sanlang, Huang Jinxing, Xia Panguan, Kuaihuo Sanniang, Shen Chengwu, Yilian Mo, Mao'er Xianggong, Dong Gong Zui, Hedongzi, Hei Sui, Wang Que'er, Jiaoyi, Jiabang, Pingfeng, Chuanxin Guo Ru Zhi, Sun Wuzi Jiao Nvbing, Feilu She, Feng Ruan Jiqin, Pu Hudie, Huiyang Dan, Da Le, Waggu, Qiao Leshen, Qiao Zhuoshe, Qiao Xuetang, Qiao Xiang Sheng, Qiao Shirniang, Duzi Qiao, Dixian, Zhuangtai, Guba, Ta Qiao, Puqi, Shi Bao Manpai, Shua Heshang, San Jianxing, and Huo Lang, etc. Among them, Zhuma'er was later used on the stage, and only later was it changed to a horsewhip. If bamboo horses were used on the stage now, everyone would think it was funny; but this vestige is preserved in children's games. The names Bao Lao, Liu Gun, Liuguo Chao, Qiao Zhuoshe, Ma Pozi, Huo Lang, Shi Bao Pai, Siguo Chao, Zhuma'er, and San Jianxing later became names of northern and southern tunes. Perhaps they were using their original music or tunes in the drama? Guanpu Naide Weng's "Capital Victory Record" does not have a special entry for New Year's Day, so I will not quote it. The Southern Song Dynasty's little court was so indulging in revelry, no wonder it perished so quickly. The book's name, "Dream Liang," probably has a profound meaning. The preface to "Dream Liang Record" says, "Times change, things are different. The richness of the city walls and gardens, and the prosperity of customs and people, how can we guarantee that they will be the same as before? Remembering the past is almost like a dream." The preface to "Wulin Old Events" says, "Singing and dancing at dawn and dusk, indulging in the years, thinking that life is just like this, and not realizing that peaceful and joyful events are hard to come by. When times change and things change, and worries and hardships scatter, recalling past travels is almost like a dream, and feelings are attached to it." This is the best lesson for us.</p>
<h3 id="e141">New Year Greetings to the Entertainment Industry <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Shan</p>
<p>As the year comes to an end and is renewed, people add joy. Thus, in movie theaters and Peking opera venues, we see crowds bustling and thriving! As business flourishes, the owners of theaters can certainly fill their pockets with legal tender. It is also heard that the dance industry will be opening "pools" that never sleep, making merry all night long, so income will naturally be even more considerable. However, while there is revelry here, there are also many suffering people within this land. Hundreds of thousands of disaster-stricken compatriots not only do not receive the slightest joy from the New Year, but instead feel a bone-chilling cold. Therefore, I can only appeal to the owners of the entertainment industry on behalf of them, earnestly requesting that they donate a special percentage of their profits, so that the masses suffering under the guns do not go hungry or cold, and can spend the New Year in peace. This would not only be immeasurable merit, but would also be in line with Mencius's saying that it is better to share joy with others.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Secret History of the Imperial Gardens and Pear Orchard in the Old Capital (6) (1) <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Therefore, a pictorial was published in Beiping, with him in the center, Lao Tan at the top, and Fu Ying at the bottom. Two lines came out of his mouth, and at the end of the lines were circles. In the circle above, facing Lao Tan, it was written: "Your son is not as good as my son." In the circle below, facing Fu Ying, it said: "Your father is not as good as my father." Unexpectedly, he saw this newspaper and said angrily: "According to this, isn't it saying that 'I'm not worth a damn'?" Xiao Pei added this sentence, which was indeed very accurate, and it became a laughing stock in Tianjin and Beiping for a while. You can imagine that he was such a dispirited person, so how could he have acquired even a tiny bit of his father's talent? As for his daughter, she was very different from her brother.</p>
<p>The old girl was naturally clever and nimble, so she deeply won Lao Tan's favor. When Lao Tan practiced his skills and warmed up his voice at home, she was always by his side, because she was in charge of all the things he used. Whenever Lao Tan mentioned what he needed to use, she would have already retrieved it and brought it to him. When he warmed up his voice, she would light his pipe and pour his tea, serving him impeccably. Even when the old man was satisfied and lay on the opium bed, pondering a good tune or reciting a few lines of dialogue, the old girl would listen most carefully. In Tan's later years, there were always honored guests at his door every day. All the princes and nobles who wanted to learn a few singing techniques had to first work on the old girl. If others were too embarrassed to urge the old man to sing a "long passage," then the old girl would use words to make the old man happy while lighting his pipe, and would interject: "Since a certain prince is bothering you with this passage, it's not good to refuse him! Please take a puff of this and entertain him for a while." When the old man saw that the girl had said so, he had no choice but to sing. There were also people like Shuyan who didn't dare to ask in person; moreover, Lao Tan also had a habit of hiding his skills. As soon as he saw an insider coming to his house, he would immediately stop, even if he was in the middle of warming up his voice. Therefore, Shuyan and the others often hid in the gatehouse to eavesdrop. For example, if they couldn't learn the "Bumping Stele" anti-erhuang, they would first discuss it with the old girl. When the huqin was tuned, she would say first: "Don't tune the strings so high! Today, the old man is going to warm up the 'Bumping Stele'." At the same time, she would say to the old man: "Isn't that right? You haven't sung this anti-tune passage in a long time!" In fact, the old man was old and couldn't remember what plays he warmed up every day. Wasn't it all up to his beloved daughter to direct him?</p>

<h3 id="e143">New Year's New Hope <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Big Kid</p>
<p>New Year, children! Although the country is still growing in the midst of war, and the nation is still struggling in the midst of suffering, with scorched earth for thousands of miles and sacrifices of people and animals; however, when the first day of the year meets us, although we don't have to say empty words like "Happy New Year and get rich," we must always examine our past to see if there is anything inappropriate. If there is, then we should naturally correct it, and from today onwards, don't let it happen again. Even if there isn't, we should redouble our efforts. At the same time, we must also have a new hope to entrust to the coming year. Children, now I will offer my New Year's hope as a New Year's gift to my dear children.</p>
<p>First hope, I hope that from today onwards, children will redouble their efforts in their studies, read less extracurricular books, play less, read more books, read more newspapers, create a scientific mind, and develop a spirit of progress; when idle, study some practical knowledge, talk about some national heroes, ancient sages, or the history of world greats, read a few beneficial stories, and also don't forget to write a diary.</p>
<p>Second hope, I hope that from today onwards, children will eliminate all bad habits and cultivate their moral, intellectual, and physical education to become a completely brave</p>
<p>Third hope, I hope that from today onwards, children will save the money for candy and toys and donate it to the country to save the country, and to help many homeless refugees; at the same time, they should persuade classmates or parents and relatives to also implement saving the country and saving the disaster.</p>
<p>Fourth hope, I hope that from today onwards, children will persuade their parents or relatives not to be traitors, not to sell their conscience, and not to sell national interests.</p>
<p>Finally, after I have finished writing my four new hopes, there is one more hope that seems superfluous but is necessary, that is, please, dear children, do not ignore this thin gift of mine, and I hope that every child can put it into practice. Finally, as usual, I have to put down my pen and say to all the children, "Happy New Year and happiness in the New Year!"</p>
<h3 id="e144">Our Reflections on New Year's Day <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>New Year's Day is the first day of the new year, how lively it is! The shops on the streets are already displaying colorful things, and the children are wearing new clothes and playing with new and interesting toys, celebrating the arrival of the new year very happily. But what is the difference between the new year and the old year? Except for the fact that people decorate themselves more beautifully on the outside, there is no change in the natural environment at all, so in addition to celebrating the new year, there is also a more important meaning, that is, whether we have made new progress in terms of being a person and in our studies, let us examine ourselves!</p>
<p>First, whether the movement for thrift is always implemented—why do I want to mention it first? Because in these few days, the beauty of material things is most likely to tempt you and make you forget this important responsibility. This is of course inevitable for people, but in this time of national crisis, accumulating this unnecessary consumption can save several lives. Moreover, as severe winter has arrived, children have added warm clothes, while those homeless refugees and soldiers fighting bloody battles on the front lines need warm clothes extremely, so as long as you do not give up halfway and strive to be thrifty, then the results will definitely be good.</p>
<p>Second, whether there has been any progress in terms of studies and character—in terms of studies, whether you have gained true knowledge. If your grades in this semester were not good due to laziness or love of play, or not knowing how to study, in terms of character, whether you are insincere, kind, or honest to others and yourself. If you have not achieved this, the New Year is really a good opportunity for us to resolve to improve.</p>
<p>Other things such as developing good habits and forging a strong body, as long as you have the will, perseverance, and a desire to improve, it is not difficult to adapt to the new environment of the future, and you will not become an eliminated laggard. He took out the New Year's money wrapped in red paper prepared under his pillow, gave it to him, and when he received the one dollar, he said thank you, and then in the new year, he bought candy, bought toys, bought New Year's cards... and used it all up.</p>
<p>Last year, Yu'er's hometown was turned into a sea of fire, and he fled with his parents, traveling thousands of miles and suffering all kinds of hardships. On New Year's Day, he was living in a thatched shed in a mountain village somewhere. As usual, he got up early in the morning and wished his parents a happy new year. He only knew it was New Year's Day when his father reminded him, and wanted to take out his New Year's money. Yu'er</p>
<h3 id="e145">Joke <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Chengxue</p>
<p>(1) Congratulations When Wang Sheng saw Min'er walking to the sports field, he greeted him and said, "My older brother got married yesterday, why didn't you come to congratulate him?"</p>
<p>Min'er smiled slightly and said, "Oh, brother, I am very sorry, from now on, if my older brother has a golden or silver wedding anniversary, I will definitely not miss it, I will definitely come to congratulate him."</p>
<p>(2) Exchange On the morning of New Year's Day, Wang Sheng's older brother said to him, "Little brother's hat is already a bit too small to wear, why don't I give it to you?"</p>
<p>Wang Sheng said with a smile, "Sixth brother, thank you! But when my head gets bigger in the future and I can't wear it anymore, I will definitely give it to you!"</p>
<p>(3) Becoming Shorter Wang Sheng's older sister is a tall woman, and she feels it is very unattractive! Later, someone told her a way, "Hide by the door and hold up an umbrella on rainy days, and your body will become smaller and shorter!"</p>
<p>On this day, Wang Sheng's older sister wanted to eat pears because of a cough, and it was raining heavily; Wang Sheng took money and went out. The older sister hurriedly came out and asked,</p>
<p>"Little brother, why don't you hold up an umbrella?" "Older sister, I want to become shorter!" Wang Sheng replied. said, "Now we are living a life of fleeing from disaster, one dollar less is one dollar less, I don't want to buy anything useless, please don't give it to me, Dad."</p>
<p>This year, Yu'er has come to Shanghai with his parents. When he went to his parents' bedside and wished them a happy new year, his father prepared the New Year's money again and put it in his hand. He took it, put it in his pocket, and asked his father, "Dad, this year, how do you think I will spend this one dollar?". His father said, "I will either buy something delicious or something fun, am I right? Yu'er didn't answer, and asked his mother again. His mother said with a smile, "I can't guess what's on your mind. In addition to what your dad guessed about delicious and fun things, there are also good-looking and good-sounding things, maybe you want to see a movie?" Yu'er said with a smile, "Mom and Dad, you're both wrong. I want to fulfill my national responsibility with this one dollar. At school, I heard the teacher say that someone has launched a one-dollar debt repayment movement. Regardless of old or young, all citizens of the Republic of China should take out one dollar to accumulate little by little to repay foreign debt. Because the New Year's money that my parents gave me happens to be one dollar, I can participate in this one-dollar debt repayment movement, so I am very happy. I am determined to take it to school after the New Year and give it to the teacher, so that he can collect the donations from the students and contribute them to the country together." Yu'er's father listened, stroked his hair, and read, "Good child! Your plan is really good! Your mother and I will also donate one dollar each."</p>
<h3 id="e146">How to Guess the Day of the Week for the Year 28? <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Lǜpíng</p>
<p>Time flies so fast, it's another New Year? What interesting games are children playing in the New Year?</p>
<p>Let me tell you a novel game here, which is how to guess the day of the week for the year 28? First, list a table below:</p>
<p>If someone asks you: What day of the week is a certain day of a certain month? You only need to add the number he said to the number in the grid of a certain month in the table, and then divide it by 7, and the remainder is the day of the week.</p>
<p>For example, someone asks you what day of the week is January 18th? We add 6, which is below the January grid, to the number he said, 18, and the sum is 24, and then divide it by 7, the remainder is 3, then it is Wednesday.</p>
<p>For example, someone asks you: What day of the week is March 4th? We add 2, which is below the March grid, to the number he said, 4, and the sum is 6. 6 cannot be divided by 7, then 6 is Saturday, so whenever the number added up is not greater than 7, there is no need to divide, it can represent what day of the week it is.</p>
<p>There is one more point to pay attention to, that is: for example, what day of the week is December 10th? The sum we added up is 14, and we divide it by 7, and the sum is 0. 0 represents Sunday, so December 10th is Sunday.</p>
<p>Finally, children, if you can do it according to the above method, then what day of the week is a certain day of a certain month? You can guess it in one or two minutes, and there are no mistakes. After everyone has read it, you might as well try it yourself!</p>

<p>— Li Yuxiu</p>
<p>Children, the New Year is here. Here is a set of gifts for you. This year is an interesting arithmetic game. This year is 1939 on the Gregorian calendar and the 28th year of the Republic of China, so let's use these numbers to play games.</p>
<p>First, think of a number in your mind, for example, you are eight years old in the New Year, so you think of 8, and then use the six numbers 1, 9, 3, 9, 2, and 8, connect them with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division symbols, so that the result of the calculation is exactly equal to 8. There is more than one such formula, so we can also invite a few friends to do it together to see who can do it faster and who can do it the simplest. At the same time, you can also change the pattern and play with other numbers. The fun is endless.</p>
<p>There are many benefits to this game: first, it can improve mental arithmetic skills, calculate quickly, and calculate correctly. Second, it can exercise your thinking and make your thinking quick. Third, you can also do intelligence tests. In the competition, you can see which of your friends is the smartest. These three things are also the intention of my gift. Below are twelve examples, please take a look:</p>
<h3 id="e148">Snow White (1) <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Tiansun</p>
<p>A long, long time ago, I don't know which dynasty or which year it was. In a certain place. There was a small king, and I don't know what his name was. The queen in this country was as beautiful as a flower, very beautiful and moving. One winter morning, the cotton-like white snow covered the earth, and she was sitting next to the window in the innermost room, her ten white jade-carved fingers were busy with embroidery. Suddenly, accidentally, the silver needle pierced the tip of her finger, and a drop of scarlet blood fell on the white snow outside the window. The red and white reflected each other, extraordinarily bright. She lowered her head to look at it, sighed with melancholy thoughts, and said to herself: "Alas! I have been looking forward to it day and night, hoping to give birth to a beautiful daughter. Her skin should be as white as snow, her lips should be as red as blood, and her hair should be as black as the ebony of my embroidery frame. Only then would it be to my liking, and I wouldn't want anything else."</p>
<p>After a short time, as expected, the heavens granted her wish, and the queen gave birth to a small baby girl. Her skin was really as white as snow, her lips were really as red as blood, and her hair was really as black as ebony. The queen was more satisfied than she could ever be, and gave her a name, called Snow White. But the queen's fate was too short, and she couldn't enjoy this lovable little baby forever: soon she contracted a serious illness, and no matter how many famous doctors in the country she asked to treat her, they were helpless, and finally abandoned her beloved daughter and said goodbye to the world forever.</p>
<p>A kingdom cannot be without a queen, so before long, the king remarried a new queen, and Snow White had a stepmother. This new queen was not as gentle and virtuous as Snow White's birth mother: she was born with a bad temper, and was very cruel. She thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world, and was very arrogant.</p>
<p>There was a secret room in the palace that no one else was allowed to enter. The new queen had a magic mirror installed there, and she cherished it like a treasure. No matter what she wanted to ask the magic mirror, the mirror would answer her truthfully. Every day, she had to face the mirror and earnestly ask: "Mirror on the wall, please answer me, who is the most beautiful woman in the world?" After she asked this, a heavy green mist immediately covered the surface of the mirror: then a strange voice came clearly from the mirror and said: "Queen, you are the most beautiful woman in the world, no one can compare to you."</p>
<p>But this hateful queen watched Snow White grow up day by day, and become more and more beautiful day by day. Her heart was burned by the fire of jealousy, and she couldn't suppress it anymore, and felt very painful. So she tried every means to make Snow White's beauty wane. All of Snow White's gorgeous clothes were destroyed.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the queen also ordered Snow White to do the heavy and hard work, such as scrubbing the floor and wiping the door thresholds. She did everything possible to torture her little body, and didn't allow her to get enough rest. Poor Snow White, who was like a golden branch and jade leaf, was turned into an extremely humble female slave.</p>
<p>However, Snow White didn't care about the heavy work; whatever the new queen asked her to do, she did it, as if she was very willing. It turned out that she had a secret to make the best of a bad situation: no matter how much physical pain and torture she suffered, she was happy in spirit. Do you know what the secret is? It is dreaming. No matter if it is in broad daylight, you don't have to sleep, and you can dream freely.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Shanghai Special Edition <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Editor's Note</p>
<p>The Shen Bao possesses a glorious history of sixty-six years. In late December of the year before last, it had to suspend publication. On Double Tenth Day last year, it was reorganized and resumed publication. On the day of resumption, we explained our aims to the readers, hoping for support from all quarters. After resuming publication, we made three grand vows:</p>
<p>1.  To promote the effectiveness of the newspaper, we will strive for widespread distribution;</p>
<p>2.  To enhance the quality of the Shen Bao, we will strive for the highest quality;</p>
<p>3.  To reduce the burden on readers, we will not hesitate to sacrifice ourselves.</p>
<p>These three points can only be judged by readers through facts, and are not something the Shen Bao can boast about on its own. However, with such aims, we must devote all our efforts. It is not to say that we have already reached an ideal state. In the past two or three months, we have been working hard, striving to do our best whenever we have the opportunity. Now, at the beginning of the year, we are expanding our coverage as usual, and we are compiling a "Shanghai Special Edition" to contribute to our readers. We believe that this edition is best suited to the needs and the times.</p>
<p>The special edition focuses on Shanghai, hoping to describe the past, record the present, and estimate the future of several important events in Shanghai. Among them, some topics are not limited to Shanghai, but the focus of these events must be tied to Shanghai. A month ago, the plan for the special edition was roughly determined, with nearly a hundred topics proposed. Although the colleagues of the Shen Bao do not underestimate themselves and have taken on the writing tasks, the scope of the issues is broad. We have asked authorities in various fields or academic experts to write articles based on their strengths. For those that require extensive interviews and consultations, we have commissioned reporters to go out and record. The faculty of the Department of Journalism at St. John's University provided much help, which is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>With a wide range of topics and a large number of articles, if published as a special book, it would be over 300,000 words, forming a large volume of more than 100 pages. If the entire edition were published on the same day as the newspaper, such a huge book would be impossible for anyone to read in a single day. Therefore, we are changing the method of the New Year's special issue from previous years and creating a new precedent: starting from New Year's Day, we will continue to publish the articles daily until all of them have been printed, so that the newspaper can arrange them in an orderly manner, and the readers can browse them at their leisure.</p>
<p>As of New Year's Eve, we have compiled more than fifty articles. The list of articles is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e150">Shanghai's Geographical Evolution <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Ran</p>
<p>Shanghai is merely a fishing village by the sea, anciently called "Hu Du". "Hu" refers to fishing gear. As for why it is named Shanghai, the Shanghai County Gazetteer of the Ming Hongzhi period, Volume 1, "Evolution," states, "The land is located above the sea, hence the name."</p>
<p>More than 4,000 years ago, Shanghai was a city in Yangzhou. During the Spring and Autumn period, it belonged to Wu, and later to Yue. During the Warring States period, it belonged to Chu. According to legend, it was the fief of Lord Chunshen of Chu, Huang Xie, hence the name of the Huangpu River, as it was dug by Huang Xie, and is also known as the Chunshen River, or simply Shen River. In the Qin Dynasty, Lou County was established, under the jurisdiction of Kuaiji Commandery. Shanghai was likely the southern part of Lou. In the early Han Dynasty, it belonged to the Kingdom of Jing, then to the Kingdom of Wu, and then to the Kingdom of Jiangdu. During the reign of Emperor Wu, it reverted to Kuaiji Commandery, under the jurisdiction of Yangzhou. During the Later Han Dynasty, it belonged to Wu Commandery, under the jurisdiction of Yangzhou Inspectorate. During the Jian'an period, it was the fief of Zhu Zhi. During the Three Kingdoms period, Wu was the Marquisate of Lou. In the Jin Dynasty, it belonged to Wu Commandery, under the jurisdiction of Yangzhou Province. The Song and Qi dynasties followed suit. During the Tianjian period of the Liang Dynasty, Lou County was abolished and Xinyi County was established. Shanghai was the southern part of Xinyi County. At the beginning of the Datong period, Kunshan County was re-established from the land of Xinyi County, still under the jurisdiction of Wu Commandery. Shanghai was again part of Kunshan County. The Chen Dynasty followed suit. In the Sui Dynasty, it was merged into Changshu. Soon, Kunshan County was re-established and transferred to Suzhou, under the jurisdiction of Yangzhou Xingtai. During the tenth year of the Tianbao period of the Tang Dynasty, Huating County was established from the lands of Kunshan, Haiyan, and Jiaxing counties, under the jurisdiction of Suzhou, under the jurisdiction of Jiangnan East Road. The Huating Sea in its northeastern part is today's Shanghai area. During the Five Dynasties, it belonged to the Wu Yue Kingdom, initially under Kaiyuan Prefecture, then under the Zhongwu Army Commissioner, and then under Xiuzhou. The Song Dynasty followed the Five Dynasties, under the jurisdiction of Liangzhe Road. In the early Qingyuan period of the Southern Song Dynasty, it belonged to Jiaxing Prefecture. Shanghai was still part of Huating County. Later, the population flourished, and sea vessels converged, gradually forming a large market. Therefore, the Superintendency of Merchant Shipping and the Tax Collection Office were established, named Shanghai Town.</p>
<p>In the twenty-seventh year of the Yuan Dynasty, at the request of Prefect Pu Sanhanwen, Shanghai County was established from the Changren Township, Gaochang Township, Beiting Township, Xinjiang Township, and Haiyu Township of Huating County, under the jurisdiction of Songjiang Prefecture, under the jurisdiction of Jiangzhe Province. Its territory extended east to the sea, south to the border of Huating County, west to Kunshan Prefecture of Pingjiang Road, and north to Jiading Prefecture of Pingjiang Road, forty-eight li from north to south, and one hundred li from east to west, with five townships and twenty-six baos under its jurisdiction. This was the size of Shanghai when it was first established as a county.</p>
<p>In the early Ming Dynasty, Shanghai County belonged to Songjiang Prefecture, directly under Nanjing. During the Jiajing period, Qingpu County was established from the Xinjiang Township, Beiting Township, and Haiyu Township in the western part of the county. It was soon abolished. During the Wanli period, it was re-established, and the remaining parts of the Beiting and Xinjiang Townships were added to it. In the early Qing Dynasty, it belonged to the prefecture as in the Ming Dynasty, under the Jiangnan Right Political Commissioner. In the early Kangxi period, it was transferred to the Jiangsu Political Commissioner. During the Yongzheng period, Nanhui County was established from the land of Changren Township in the southwestern part. During the Jiaqing period, fifteen tus of coastal land in Gaochang Township were ceded to the Chuansha Pacification Subprefecture. At this time, Shanghai only controlled three baos in Changren Township and nine baos in Gaochang Township, and its area became smaller and smaller. This remained the case until the end of the Qing Dynasty, without any changes.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Republic of China, the daos, prefectures, states, and subprefectures were abolished and changed to be directly under Jiangsu Province. In the third year of the Republic of China, the Dao official system was re-established, under the jurisdiction of the Huhai Dao, with the same territory as in the late Qing Dynasty. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the Superintendent Office of the Songhu Commercial Port was established. The area under its jurisdiction, in addition to the entire Shanghai County, included the city and five townships of Wusong, Jiangwan, Yinhang, Pengpu, Zhenru, and Gaoqiao belonging to Baoshan County. All administrative affairs were managed by the office and did not belong to the administrative scope of the province.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the National Revolutionary Army established Shanghai, which was designated as a special municipality directly under the central government. The area of the Shanghai Special Municipality, in addition to the original jurisdiction of the Songhu Commercial Port, included the two townships of Dachang and Yanghang belonging to Baoshan County, parts of the seven townships belonging to Songjiang and Qingpu counties, part of the Xinzhuang Township belonging to Songjiang County, and part of the Zhoupu Township belonging to Nanhui County, across five counties, with thirty municipalities and townships under its jurisdiction, covering an area of 2,692 square li, seventy li from east to west, and about a hundred li from north to south. Although the boundaries of the city were demarcated, only the eleven municipalities and townships of Hunan and Zhabei belonging to Shanghai County and the six municipalities and townships of Wusong and Gaoqiao belonging to Baoshan County were taken over in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, and all were renamed districts. In May of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the National Government promulgated the Municipal Organization Law, changing the special municipalities to municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan. In July of the same year, it was renamed Shanghai Municipality, with the same jurisdiction as before.</p>
<p>The four boundaries of Shanghai Municipality are: Chuansha County and Nanhui County to the east; Nanhui County to the south; Jiading County, Qingpu County, and Songjiang County to the west; Baoshan County to the north, and bordering the Yangtze River.</p>

<p>This map is taken from the first Shanghai County Gazetteer, the Ming Hongzhi Shanghai Gazetteer, and is therefore the first map of Shanghai, drawn more than 430 years ago.</p>

<p>The first Shanghai County Gazetteer was the "Shanghai Gazetteer" compiled in the seventeenth year of the Ming Hongzhi period. When the Kangxi Shanghai County Gazetteer was revised and compiled in the twenty-second year of the Qing Kangxi period, it was nowhere to be found. Subsequent revisions of the gazetteer failed to discover this book. The Shanghai Municipal Tongzhi Museum has long been known for its dedication to historical research. It made every effort to search for the Hongzhi Gazetteer and finally discovered it in the Tianyi Pavilion in Ningbo the year before last. The above picture is a page from the Hongzhi Gazetteer. Unfortunately, the Municipal Tongzhi Museum has ceased its work due to the war, but the drafts compiled by the museum will be published by Zhonghua Book Company.</p>

<p>— Dong Bai</p>
<p>Shanghai's geographical advantages attracted the attention of foreign merchants early on. During the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, someone from the British East India Company suggested to the company authorities that Shanghai was a promising commercial port. During the Jiaqing period, due to the prohibition of opium, the British merchants who were trading in Guangdong were impatient and sought to open commercial ports outside of Guangdong. In the twelfth year of the Daoguang period, they sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate and request trade in Shanghai, but were rejected by Daotai Wu Qitai, and they left without success. Three years later, Lin Zexu burned opium in Guangdong, and the British went to war with our country. In June of the twentieth year of the Daoguang period, the British army captured Dinghai. In April of the twenty-second year, they occupied Zhapu. On the eighth day of the fifth month, they occupied Wusong, and on the eleventh, they occupied Shanghai. On the fifteenth, the British army left Shanghai and went up the river to attack Zhenjiang and Nanjing. On the fourth day of the seventh month, the British attacked Nanjing. Our country, unable to withstand the pressure of new weapons, announced peace talks. On the twenty-fourth day of the seventh month, Imperial Commissioner Yilibu and Qiying signed a peace treaty of thirteen articles with the British Plenipotentiary Representative Henry Pottinger, which is known as the Treaty of Nanjing. Article 2 of the treaty stipulated that five ports would be opened for trade:</p>
<p>"From now on, the Emperor grants British subjects the right to reside with their families in the coastal ports of Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo, and Shanghai to trade without hindrance. The British monarch may appoint consuls to reside in these five cities to handle the affairs of merchants and communicate with the local officials. The British shall pay customs duties and taxes according to the regulations listed below." Article 6 of the Supplementary Treaty of Commerce of the Daoguang 23rd year stated:</p>
<p>"In the five ports of Guangdong, etc., British merchants may reside permanently or travel from time to time, but they must not arbitrarily travel in the countryside or trade inland. Chinese local officials should discuss and determine boundaries with British consuls based on local customs and terrain, and must not cross them, in order to maintain permanent peace. All sailors and crew members must be allowed to go ashore only after the consuls and local officials have established regulations in advance. If any British subjects violate these regulations and travel far inland without permission, regardless of their rank, the local people may arrest them and hand them over to the British consul for punishment, but the local people must not beat or injure them, causing harm to the good relations." Article 7 also stated:</p>
<p>"In the Treaty of Perpetual Peace, it is clearly stated that British subjects are allowed to bring their families to reside in the five ports of Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo, and Shanghai without mutual deception or restraint. However, Chinese local officials must discuss with British consuls to determine where, in what places, and with what houses or land British subjects are allowed to lease. The value must be based on the current value of the five ports, seeking fairness. Chinese people must not extort, and British merchants must not forcibly lease. The British consul shall notify the local officials each year of the number of houses built or rented by British subjects, and report them for record. However, the increase or decrease of houses depends on the number of merchants and the prosperity or decline of trade, and it is difficult to determine a fixed number." The above clauses are all related to Shanghai and are the basic treaties for the opening of Shanghai. On September 17 of the Daoguang 23rd year, the first British Consul, G. Balfour, along with his translator, Medhurst, arrived in Shanghai from Zhoushan. A week later, he announced the official opening of Shanghai.</p>
<p>After Britain opened the door to China, France and the United States also followed suit. In September of the twenty-fourth year of the Daoguang period, France and China signed the Treaty of Whampoa of thirty-six articles. In May of the same year, the United States and China signed the Treaty of Wangxia. Both treaties were treaties for opening five ports for trade.</p>
<p>After Shanghai was opened, foreigners came to Shanghai to reside one after another and established settlements, which are called concessions. The first was the British Concession. The concessions had regulations called land regulations or property regulations, commonly known as the Yangjingbang Regulations. The first set of regulations for the British Concession was promulgated by Shanghai Daotai Gong Muxiu in the twenty-fifth year of the Daoguang period, with twenty-three articles. Later, one article was added, making a total of twenty-four articles, stipulating the boundaries, land leasing procedures, and matters that foreigners should abide by. Later, the foreigners repeatedly revised and amended them on their own, forming the substance of today's municipal law of the Public Concession, completely changing its original appearance. The Chinese version of the first set of land regulations is no longer available. The English full text was published in the English-language North China Herald on January 17, 1852. The translation is published in the first issue of the Shanghai Municipal Tongzhi Museum Journal, which scholars can refer to for research.</p>
<p>Before the second year of the Tongzhi period, there was no such thing as a Public Concession in Shanghai. At that time, the British and American concessions were independent of each other. The American Concession was established in the twenty-eighth year of the Daoguang period. The one who initiated the establishment of the American Concession was "Wen Jianshi", namely, Reverend William J. Boone of Wen Jianshi Road. Later, security problems arose in the American Concession, and the Americans proposed merging the American Concession with the British Concession. Thus, the Public Concession was established. Initially, the British Concession had an area of only 138 mu. In the twenty-fifth year of the Guangxu period, the Public Concession had an area of 5,583 acres, which is equivalent to more than 33,000 Chinese mu. However, the 47,000 mu of roads built beyond the boundary are not included. The above area is the area today.</p>
<p>The origin of the Shanghai French Concession was in the twenty-seventh year of the Daoguang period. The first consul was de Montigny. The road in front of the Great World, from north to south, called Avenue de Montigny, commemorates this consul. The land initially leased by the French was very small, only two mu, three fen, eight li, and five hao. The French Concession was officially established in the spring of the twenty-ninth year of the Daoguang period, with an area of about 56 hectares. Its boundaries were as follows: south to the city moat; north to the Yangjingbang; west to the Guandi Temple and the Chu Family Bridge; east to the Chaozhou Guild Hall, along the river to the east corner of the Yangjingbang. The agreement for the French Concession also stipulated that "if the land is not enough in the future, we will discuss other land as needed." The French Concession expanded once in the eleventh year of the Xianfeng period, increasing its area by three hectares. In the twenty-sixth year of the Guangxu period, it expanded a second time, increasing its area by another 1,112 mu, totaling 144 hectares. In the third year of the Republic of China, it expanded a third time, reaching an area of 1,002 hectares, twenty times larger than when it was first established.</p>
<p>The administration of the Public Concession was governed by the Shanghai Municipal Council. The organizational system of the Municipal Council consisted of a foreign ratepayers' meeting, which elected the Board of Directors, which in turn organized various business committees. Under the Board of Directors, there was a Director-General, who presided over the General Office. The General Office was responsible for the Volunteer Corps, the Police Department, the Fire Department, the Health Department, the Works Department, the Education Department, the Finance Department, and the Intelligence Department.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council currently has fourteen directors, five Chinese, five British, two American, and two Japanese. There is a Chairman and a Vice-Chairman. The establishment of Chinese directors was achieved after much struggle in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China. The Board of Directors decides on the important administration of the Municipal Council and has the power to appoint or dismiss officials in the bureau. Meetings are held every two or three weeks, and important documents are sent to each director for comments.</p>
<p>The administrative organ of the French Concession was the Conseil d'Administration Municipale, whose directors were initially appointed by the French Consul. Later, according to the organizational law of the Conseil d'Administration Municipale of the fifth and seventh years of the Tongzhi period, it was changed to an election system. In January of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, a new organizational law was promulgated, replacing the Board of Directors with a Provisional Committee. There were five Chinese directors and three Chinese commissioners on the committee. The participation of the three Chinese directors was also decided after the revision of the charter of the Conseil d'Administration Municipale after the victory of the National Revolution in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The internal organization of the Conseil d'Administration Municipale is divided into five departments: (1) General Administration Department; (2) Municipal General Administration Department, further divided into the Secretariat, Finance and Litigation Office, Property Office, Business Classification Office, Salt Affairs Office, Health and Relief Office, Slaughterhouse, Education Office; (3) Technical Administration Department: General Technical Research Office, Radio Station, Signal Station, Observatory, Fire Brigade, Planting and Cultivation Office, Public Works Office; (4) Legal Advisory Department; (5) Police Department.</p>
<p>There are three types of courts in the Shanghai Concessions: (1) Consular Courts, (2) Mixed Courts, and (3) Special District Courts. The Consular Courts were established based on consular jurisdiction. The Mixed Courts were organized by consuls from several countries and were established based on the land regulations of the eighth year of the Tongzhi period. The Special District Courts were formerly the Mixed Court, whose power was in the hands of foreigners. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, they were recovered through negotiations by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and a Provisional Court was established. In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government and representatives of the five countries of Great Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, Norway, and Brazil signed an agreement in Nanjing regarding the Chinese courts in the Shanghai Public Concession. The French representative also signed the agreement later.</p>

<p>The geographical position of Shanghai on the Earth's longitude and latitude is as follows:</p>
<p>According to the measurement of the longitude and latitude of the Jianghai Customs flagpole by the Xunpu Bureau, it is:</p>
<p>East longitude 121 degrees 29 minutes 00.02 seconds;</p>
<p>North latitude 31 degrees 14 minutes 20.38 seconds.</p>
<p>Shanghai is China's only large commercial port, and its waterway is formed by the Huangpu River. According to the port area defined by the Xunpu Bureau, the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau is the upper end of the port, and Donggoukou is the lower end, with a total length of 54,000 feet. There are five bends in the middle. The distance between the two banks varies from 1,080 feet to 2,000 feet. Except for the Zhoujiazhui Beach, even the smallest tidal flat has a width of 1,000 to 2,000 feet. However, the waterway with a depth of 24 feet has an average width of only 750 feet. The port can accommodate more than 400,000 tons of ships, that is, about 70 ships ranging from 2,000 tons to 10,000 tons can be berthed at the same time.</p>
<p>Ships coming from overseas or coastal areas must first pass through the Yangtze River estuary, then through Wusong, and enter the Huangpu River. There are no reefs in the northeast sea outside the estuary, and there is 60 feet of deep water 30 nautical miles from the coast. In the southeast sea, there are many islands and sandbars, which are obstacles to navigation. Therefore, it is necessary to follow the waterways designated by the lighthouses and buoys set up around the islands.</p>
<p>With Shanghai Port as the center, water routes can be divided into three routes: coastal routes, inland river routes, and ocean routes.</p>
<p>Coastal routes reach various ports along the coast of our country, divided into two routes: one is the South Seas route, which goes south from Shanghai through Ningbo, Taizhou, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Hong Kong, ending in Guangzhou, or extending to Haiphong and Saigon in French Indochina; the other is the North Seas route, which goes north from Shanghai and can reach Haizhou, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai, Tianjin, Yingkou, Dalian, Qinhuangdao, and other places.</p>
<p>Inland river routes, also known as inland port routes, mainly include the Yangtze River route, followed by the Suzhou Creek route and the Huangpu River route. The Yangtze River route goes upstream from Wusongkou in this port, passing through various ports in the Yangtze River basin, reaching Chongqing. The section of the waterway between Shanghai and Hankou is 592 miles long, and it is the most beautiful. In winter, it can accommodate ships with a draft of 8 to 10 feet, and in summer, it can accommodate ships with a draft of 28 to 30 feet. The Suzhou Creek route flows east into the Huangpu River. Going northwest along the river, it reaches Wuxian County, a distance of 300 li. It also connects to the hinterland of Jiangsu, such as Qingpu, Kunshan, Changshu, Hushu Pass, Wangting, Dangkou, Wuxi, and other places. The Huangpu River route goes south and southwest along the Huangpu River, connecting the southern part of Jiangsu and the hinterland of Zhejiang. The distance to Hangzhou is 500 li, and the distance to Wuxing is 600 li.</p>
<p>Ocean routes reach major commercial ports around the world, including the Sino-European route, the Sino-American route, the South Seas Indian route, the Australian route, the Japanese route, and the Siberian route. Our country's ocean routes start from the four ports of Dalian, Shanghai, Xiamen, and Hong Kong, with Shanghai being located in the middle of the coast.</p>
<p>The South Seas route along the coast seems to have been very early, while the North Seas route can be traced back to the Yuan Dynasty's sea transport. As for the ocean routes, the South Seas route was opened during the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty when Zheng He was sent to the Western Seas (commonly known as the Three Treasures Eunuch's voyages to the Western Seas). Chen Chang, a native of Shanghai, accompanied Zheng He to the Western Seas.</p>
<p>Shanghai's importance today is largely due to changes in the times, but its excellent geographical location is also the foundation for its development. The Shanghai County Gazetteer Continuation, Boundary Records, states: "Shanghai is located at the end of the eight provinces, the center of the seven coastal provinces, and the focus of the Pacific Ocean route." This truly explains Shanghai's geographical advantages.</p>

<h3 id="e154">1939 New Model Renault's Advantages <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Wenxu</p>
<p>Renault is a renowned French automobile manufacturer. Over the years, all its vehicles have been produced with the aim of serving society. Now, to further advance its service to society, the factory has specially produced a petite and exquisite Renault automobile, naming it "Show Hua." Historically, the factory's cars have been prefixed with various names such as "Superieur," "Outstanding Beauty," and "Wei Hua." The "Show Hua" model for this year is no different and is not a secondary brand; this is what the author must declare before introducing the car. The Renault "Show Hua" is a modern, state-of-the-art two-door, four-cylinder small car, featuring novel design, meticulous planning, careful material selection, and exquisite workmanship. Its engine is small yet highly efficient, and its body is small yet provides extensive service. This is the car produced from the factory's years of experience and dedication to improvement. Its advantages are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Safety: The car body is made of a single piece of pure steel, and all the glass installed is shatterproof. The car's center of gravity is low, ensuring stable and agile driving. The car body is moderately short, with a slender profile, enhanced by a new-style direct steering system, clear visibility, and easy handling. The safety features are considered comprehensive. Although the car's body is small, the fuel tank is located at the rear, which shows the factory's meticulous attention to passenger safety.</p>
<p>Efficiency: The four-cylinder small engine, with cylinders having a capacity of only one liter, produces remarkable power while being highly economical. It achieves 15 miles per gallon and 65 miles per hour while carrying four people and their luggage. Isn't this outstanding economic design clearly superior? In terms of efficiency, the engine has strong power, quick starts, and excellent momentum. The most enjoyable aspect is that the car can start in third gear.</p>
<p>Elegance: The new model Renault "Show Hua" automobile has an aesthetically pleasing and magnificent style. Its appearance is beautiful and captivating. The steering wheel is light, and handling is easy. It can turn freely on narrow roads without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Comfort: The Renault "Show Hua" offers spacious and comfortable front and rear seats, with exceptionally thoughtful interior decoration. Although it only has two doors, entry and exit are very convenient. Even tall individuals do not encounter any difficulty. The independent front wheels have standard springs, the car's center of gravity is low, and with flexible steel plates, a sturdy chassis, and powerful shock absorbers, the car's stability, safety, and comfort during driving have reached a pinnacle. As for durability, it is a special advantage of Renault automobiles, and the 1939 Renault "Show Hua" is indeed outstanding.</p>
<p>Economy: Renault automobiles are renowned not only for fuel economy but also for controlling mechanical friction. The Renault "Show Hua" produced this year, even when driven at extremely high speeds, has a remarkably gentle engine rotation speed. The movement of major engine components, such as cylinders, sleeves, and pistons, is reduced accordingly. Consequently, the car's service life is extended, and the annual repair costs are significantly reduced. It is reported that a large batch of new cars arrived in Shanghai on the 6th of this month, and the dealer is the French automobile company of Lufeilu Road.</p>

<p>The court was abolished, and on April 1, the Jiangsu Shanghai Special District Court and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court were established. On July 28, 1931, the Chinese government and France signed an agreement on Chinese courts in the French Concession, along with four annexes and seven articles. Immediately afterward, in accordance with the agreement, the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Court and the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court were established in the French Concession.</p>
<p>Appendix: Land Regulations</p>
<p>The Land Regulations were first promulgated by Hu Dao Gong Muju in the 25th year of the Daoguang Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, consisting of twenty-three articles. Later, one more article was added, and they were revised once in the fourth year of the Xianfeng Emperor. In the eighth year of the Tongzhi Emperor, they were further modified, bringing the total to twenty-nine articles and forty-two attached regulations. The Chinese translation was titled "Shanghai Yangjingbang North Concession Regulations" and "Shanghai Yangjingbang North Foreign Concession Land Regulations with Attached Rules." Further modifications were made during the Guangxu era, such as the addition of Chinese directors, but these were not incorporated into the regulations. The regulations are attached below for reference; the attached rules are omitted.</p>
<p>1.  Shanghai Yangjingbang North Concession Regulations, Revised in the Middle of the Guangxu Era of the Qing Dynasty</p>
<p>Article 1: Defining the Boundaries of the Area</p>
<p>The boundaries of the concession area were negotiated in detail by the commissioners sent by Liu, the Governor-General of Liangjiang, and the Shanghai County, along with the head directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council in 1899. Boundary stones were erected, and maps were drawn for compliance. The boundaries are now listed as follows:</p>
<p>North: Suzhou Creek, i.e., Wusong River, from Xiaoshadu to about 70 yards west of the connection with Nicheng Creek. From there, northwards to about 70 yards west of the boundary between Baoshan and Shanghai counties. From this boundary, directly to the connecting Hongkou port area, and from there, eastwards to Gujia Creek mouth.</p>
<p>East: Huangpu River, from Gujia Creek mouth to Yangjingbang mouth.</p>
<p>South: Yangjingbang, from Yangjingbang mouth to the connection with Nicheng Creek. From there, southwestwards along the northern branch of Changbang on Da West Road, and along this branch road directly to the Wusheng Temple behind Jing'an Temple Town.</p>
<p>West: From Wusheng Temple directly northwards to Xiaoshadu on the Suzhou River.</p>
<p>Article 2: Method of Renting Land</p>
<p>Anyone within the defined concession boundaries wishing to rent land or purchase houses and property from the original Chinese owners must comply with the treaties and agreements established between China and the various countries.</p>
<p>Article 3: How to Perfect Land Rental Matters and the Method of Establishing Contracts</p>
<p>For permanent land rental matters, if there are no impediments, the prospective tenant is permitted to negotiate the value and other matters with the original Chinese owner. A report must be made to the responsible consul, and two copies of the permanent lease deed written by the original Chinese owner, in the same format, along with a map showing the terrain and detailing the four boundaries, must be submitted to the consulate. The consul will then forward them to the Shanghai Daotai Yamen for verification. After verifying that there are no obstacles to the rental of the land, the Daotai will affix the seal and return the documents. The value of the land can then be paid in full. If there are graves or coffins on the rented land, their relocation or removal must be negotiated separately, as Chinese custom dictates that such matters are not written into the permanent lease deed.</p>
<p>Article 4: Land Rental Must Be Registered and Mortgages Must Also Be Reported</p>
<p>After completing the property purchase and contract establishment according to the above regulations, the tenant must, within one year, report and register the property at the responsible consular office. Subsequently, any mortgages must also be reported to the responsible consular office for registration within one month.</p>
<p>The Land Office, with the approval of the Consular Body, was established in 1900 to manage land matters registered at the consulates in the concession. The current regulations are as follows:</p>
<p>When a registration request is made, after the consul reviews the submitted petition and informs the Shanghai Daotai, and after the Daotai approves the measurement date, the Land Office and the parties involved must be notified immediately. The Land Office will then dispatch a commissioner to participate in the measurement.</p>
<p>After the consulate receives the Daotai's deed and map, it will create a similar map and send it to the Land Office, which has seven days to return it to the consulate. The Daotai's deed can be issued after seven days.</p>
<p>If the Land Office has any objections regarding the landowner's area, boundaries, graves, or rights of way, it must indicate them clearly when returning the map. After the consul approves them, the Daotai is informed again. However, if the consul does not agree with the objections, the Daotai's deed can be issued immediately without delay.</p>
<p>At this time, the consul must send a written notice to the original applicant, stating that they must comply with Article 7 of the Land Regulations. Simultaneously, another written notice should be sent to the Land Office, stating the details of the issuance of the Daotai's deed. If there are any changes to the ownership area, boundaries, or other items recorded in the deed, the same written notice should be used to record them in detail.</p>
<p>When the map is returned, the Land Office must state the registration number so that it can be entered into the Daotai's deed.</p>
<p>According to the supplementary regulations issued by the Land Office in 1904, the Daotai's deed can only be finalized after the Land Office issues a certificate confirming that the boundary stones have been erected.</p>
<p>Article 5: Transfer of Contracts Must Also Be Registered</p>
<p>Any transfer of rented land must be reported to the consulate where the original contract was registered. The new tenant must also submit a request for registration to the responsible consular office, and the consul will notify the Municipal Council (i.e., the Public Works Department).</p>
<p>Article 6: Ceding Land for Public Use</p>
<p>All Westerners who have leased land within the concession and have ceded land for public use (such as roads or reclaimed land) must continue to comply with the previous regulations, using it solely for public purposes and not for any other use. If there is reclaimed land within newly purchased land in the future, it must also be ceded for public use in accordance with this regulation. Because it is necessary to plan in advance for the expansion and construction of roads for traffic in the concession, the Municipal Council shall survey the map every New Year's Day and jointly determine the locations where new roads should be built (the Municipal Council is a joint council of the Westerners who have leased land within the concession and those entitled to participate in the deliberations, as detailed below). Whenever there is a transfer of land, any newly reclaimed land or land to be opened as roads must be ceded by the tenant for public use in accordance with the regulations (this regulation is a well-known regulation for leasing land and should be complied with). This land ceded in accordance with the regulations and already used for public purposes, and approved by a joint meeting of all tenants and others, cannot be arbitrarily reclaimed by the original owner except when it is returned to the original owner with the approval of a joint meeting of all tenants and others. The annual rent that should be paid for this land that has been ceded for public use is still paid by the original owner, but this cannot be used as a basis for managing the property. In addition to the above-mentioned items, if there is any occupation of reclaimed land or roads for public purposes, it must first be approved by the tenant, and this chapter cannot be invoked as an excuse. After the tenants jointly agree to place the land under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Council, the Municipal Council shall issue a notice stating the locations where public roads are to be built. If any merchants from treaty countries who have previously purchased property in the area have any objections to the public road locations mentioned in the Municipal Council's notice, they must submit a written report to the responsible consul within fourteen days, or send a special letter to the Municipal Council, in order to find a solution. If a compromise cannot be reached according to the consul's opinion, the Municipal Council may decline to take responsibility for the area, and the matter shall be dropped. The land of the tenants within the concession (including those entitled to participate in the deliberations) can be used for the formation of streets and the construction of public gardens for the public to enjoy and relax. All expenses for purchasing, building, and maintaining these streets and gardens are permitted to be paid by the Municipal Council from the donations collected in accordance with Article 9. However, it is declared that these streets and gardens are exclusively for public use and benefit all residents of the concession.</p>
<p>Supplementary Regulation One</p>
<p>For land ceded for the construction of new roads, widening of old roads, and all other public needs, tenants in the concession may increase their rights, in addition to the original provisions of Article 6, there are new and revised regulations.</p>
<p>1. The Municipal Council shall declare the diagrams referred to in the original Article 6, which are proposed for public use. Western lessees who have already managed the land before the declaration of the diagrams, or who have already leased the land but have not yet managed it, shall be permitted to report the detailed circumstances and the unwillingness to comply to the Municipal Council in writing, or to present a report to the Bureau in person, or to have someone speak on their behalf, within three months, for the Municipal Council to make a decision. If more than four months have elapsed and the lessee's statement has been verified within one year of the declaration of the diagrams, but resistance is still shown, the Land and Property Directors elected and established later shall jointly assess and estimate the value of the land and the price of the buildings, and if non-compliance continues, the officials assisting the tenants shall assist to extend the powers of the Land and Property Directors, although the original text of Article 6 may appear to have a difference.</p>
<p>2. Three Land and Property Directors shall be selected to estimate the land value and shall be appointed. One director shall be selected from each lessee who pays 10 taels or more of tax annually, recorded in the register, on the day of the election of the Municipal Council directors. The names of the guarantors may be submitted to the Municipal Council for safekeeping seven days before the meeting, and shall be declared at the time of the election so that the public is aware. If there is only one name of the guarantor at the time, then this director shall be determined as the Land and Property Director, and there shall be no need for public election. Another director shall be publicly elected by the donors in the concession. The names of the donors may be submitted to the Municipal Council for safekeeping seven days before the meeting, and on the day of the election, the Municipal Council shall declare the names of the donors and the circumstances of the meeting to the public. If no names of the guarantors are received at the Bureau at the time, then a suitable person shall be temporarily appointed as the Land and Property Director. All three directors shall take office on the day after the annual meeting of donors and shall complete the unfinished matters they have handled during their term of office before handing over. Persons who receive salaries from the Municipal Council shall not be selected or appointed as Land and Property Directors. If a director is vacant within one year, the original electors shall re-elect a director to take over. If it is absolutely necessary, a special meeting shall be held for public election. All matters shall be decided within one month, and extensions may be granted by public discussion. The public expenses of the directors shall be provided from public funds, and the amount of remuneration shall be determined in advance by the Municipal Council or paid according to the length of service.</p>
<p>Supplementary Regulation Two (Railways)</p>
<p>If a railway company, either by imperial decree or by official instruction, intends to purchase land for building a railway within the concession, it must submit drawings to the Municipal Council for review. The railway construction method, including any interference with public roads, the construction of bridges and culverts, passage through flat land, and all important circumstances, must be clearly stated. If approved by the Municipal Council, the company may purchase the required land from the tenant, following the Municipal Council's regulations for purchasing land for public use, paying the current market price and an additional premium of at least 25 taels per 100 taels of land price to compensate for the losses incurred by the forced purchase. If the tenant still suffers losses, the Land and Property Directors shall assess and grant compensation.</p>
<p>Article 7: Erecting Boundary Stones</p>
<p>The boundaries of leased land must be handled under the supervision of (Chinese officials and the responsible consul), and boundary stones must be erected, with the assigned numbers written in both (English and Chinese) and engraved clearly and accurately. A date must be set, and the responsible consul must send someone to accompany the tenant, the local bailiff, the original owner, and others to check that there are no violations of the roads and boundaries before the boundary stones are erected, to avoid disputes and lawsuits in the future.</p>
<p>Article 8: Deadline for Paying Annual Rent</p>
<p>If there is any annual rent owed by the Chinese owner for land leased to Westerners, it must be paid in full for the coming year by December 15 of each year. If there are any delays or defaults, the Shanghai Daotai will send a letter to the responsible consul to pursue the Westerner who has leased the land to pay.</p>
<h2>Page 36</h2>
<p>Article 9: Levying Taxes on Roads, Wharves, Land, Buildings, and Other Items. The Concession Area Must Be Planned and Managed in Advance to Ensure Proper Order.</p>
<p>1. Establish a Municipal Council.</p>
<p>2. Construct and maintain all necessary public works within the concession.</p>
<p>3. Maintain cleanliness and order throughout the concession, install streetlights, and water the streets to prevent dust, and open up drainage ditches.</p>
<p>4. Establish street patrols and police.</p>
<p>5. Prepare for the acquisition of public land and buildings needed by the Municipal Council, whether by renting or purchasing.</p>
<p>6. Procure the funds needed by the Municipal Council to hire all levels of staff and pay their monthly wages.</p>
<p>Because the above-mentioned matters require silver, either through borrowing or other means, the consuls of various countries (or a majority thereof) shall select a date in early February of each year (giving public notice at least two weeks in advance) to elect the directors of the Municipal Council in accordance with the regulations below. The consuls of various countries shall also announce in February, limiting 21 days to gather people to jointly discuss the funding of the above-mentioned matters, and to approve those gathered at this meeting (lessees who have property rights, and those who are given power of attorney to act on behalf of those who are absent) to implement the collection of donations and issuance of licenses (according to the various rules and regulations below), (all matters discussed and approved, either by unanimous or majority consent, can be implemented). It is also permitted to initially estimate the value of land and rent of buildings as a basis for collecting donations, but the land tax must be proportional to the building tax. The land tax shall be collected based on the estimated current value of the land, and the building tax shall be collected based on the estimated annual rent. In general, if the land tax is one tael, the building tax shall not exceed twenty taels, and so on. It is also permitted to collect cargo dues, and donations may be levied on goods passing through customs within the concession, or on goods loaded and unloaded at the wharf or transshipped from ships. The amount of the donation shall be determined according to the value of the goods, but the donation shall not exceed one mace per hundred taels of cargo value. It is also permitted to adjust the amount of various donations as needed to prepare for the funding needed for the above-mentioned matters.</p>
<p>Article 10: Joint Election of Municipal Council Directors</p>
<p>The directors of the Municipal Council shall be elected by the tenants and those entitled to participate in the deliberations, in accordance with the meeting in Article 9 and the regulations below. The number of directors shall not exceed nine and shall not be less than five, so that the donation tax can be collected in accordance with the regulations, and the collected donations can be stored and disbursed according to the regulations, and all matters that should be handled in the regulations should be strictly followed to ensure proper order. Therefore, after the directors are elected and appointed, they shall be given full power to handle the collection and disbursement of donations. If anyone fails to pay the donation in accordance with the regulations, the directors shall file a lawsuit with the responsible government office to pursue the payment and detain the debtor's property as collateral, or seize and sell the debtor's goods and equipment to offset the debt, in order to emphasize the importance of donations.</p>
<p>Article 11: Municipal Council Directors to Formulate Regulations</p>
<p>After the Municipal Council directors have been properly elected in accordance with the regulations, all the powers and authorities of the regulations that have been approved and attached to the regulations, as well as the matters that should be handled by the directors in the regulations, shall be fully granted to the incumbent directors of the Municipal Council and their successors. The directors of the council have the power to formulate new regulations at any time in order to further improve the various items of the regulations and may amend, modify, or suspend the formulated regulations, but they must not conflict with the regulations and must be approved and announced before they can be implemented. Regulations formulated by the directors of the council in accordance with the regulations, except those specifically referring to the internal affairs of the council and the affairs of its staff, must be approved by the consuls of the various countries (or a majority thereof) and the imperial minister stationed in Beijing, and must be specially requested to gather all tenants to agree before they can be implemented. The date of the special request for a meeting of all tenants must be announced ten days in advance, and the reason for the meeting must be stated.</p>
<p>Article 12: Review of Accounts</p>
<p>The Municipal Council shall have its accounts of all receipts and expenditures reviewed by a qualified person. After the joint meeting of all tenants approves the accounts, the cleared accounts shall be published for public inspection. The review of the Municipal Council's accounts by the tenants shall take place at the annual meeting (i.e., the annual public meeting in Article 9) as stipulated by the consuls of the various countries.</p>
<p>Article 13: Pursuing Overdue Donations</p>
<p>If anyone refuses to pay the donation (i.e., the various donations collected in accordance with these regulations) or refuses to pay the fines (i.e., the fines for violating the regulations in the attached rules), the Municipal Council, or its appointed manager, shall file a lawsuit with the responsible government office for pursuit. After obtaining approval, the law shall be applied to recover the overdue donation. If the debtor is a cargo owner who cannot be found, or is outside the jurisdiction of the responsible official, or is a person over whom no consul has jurisdiction, then the Municipal Council, after obtaining approval from the local official, shall detain the cargo (i.e., the cargo for which various donations are due, and for which there is a delay or refusal to pay) to offset the debt, or take other measures to recover the overdue donation. If the debtor is a property owner, a portion of their property shall be seized to cover the amount of the overdue donation.</p>
<p>Article 14: Recovering Fines in the Regulations</p>
<p>If anyone violates the regulations in the attached rules and is subject to a fine, or fails to pay the license fee, the Municipal Council may file a complaint with the responsible government office. After the responsible official verifies the facts, he shall order the violator to pay the fine (or pay the compensation, or deposit it for use) and pay the litigation costs (i.e., the expenses incurred by the Municipal Council in pursuing the fine from the violator), all of which shall be handled by the official as appropriate. All fines and other items in the (currently established and to be adjusted in the future) regulations shall be recorded in the register to enrich the funds and facilitate disbursement in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>Article 15: Special Meetings</p>
<p>Whenever a public meeting needs to be convened, it may be convened at any time by the consuls of treaty countries (one or more) or by property-owning tenants (those entitled to participate in the deliberations, at least twenty-five people, must write a letter of approval before it can be held) to discuss matters of great importance to the public within the concession (the date of the meeting and the matter to be discussed must be announced ten days in advance). In this special meeting, the number of tenants in the concession must be counted. If very few people are present, at least one-third must be present (all property-owning tenants who are entitled to participate in the deliberations, whether they are present in person or are absent and have given a power of attorney to someone to act on their behalf, are included in this number), and if a majority of those present agree, then all those entitled to participate in the deliberations who are not present must comply with the agreed-upon matter. When attending a meeting, if a consul is present, the consul with the longest tenure shall be the leader of the meeting. If no consul is present, one person shall be publicly elected from among those entitled to participate in the deliberations (the number of people who agree to the election must be a majority) to be the leader of this deliberation meeting. If matters are agreed upon and approved at a public meeting in accordance with these regulations, and are not mentioned in the regulations and are of great importance to the public, the leader of the meeting must report the matter to the consuls for their consideration and approval before it can be implemented. However, once the matter has been agreed upon, the consuls' instructions shall be issued after ten days. If anyone believes that it is detrimental to their (own property), they may, within this ten-day period, submit a request to the consul for review. If two months have passed and the consul has issued a public announcement of approval, everyone must comply.</p>
<p>Article 16: Graves</p>
<p>Within the concession, a suitable place should be specifically selected for the construction of Western cemeteries. If there are graves of the original Chinese owners on the land leased by Westerners, they must not be moved without agreement. The original owners are also allowed to visit and sweep the graves at any time. In short, no more coffins are allowed to be buried on the land within the concession.</p>
<p>1. For the need of land for the building of a crematorium may be requested to the land officer or the director of the health office.</p>
<p>2. No burial or cremation shall be made unless the director of the health office approves the certificate of death.</p>
<p>3. Without special permission, exhumation is not permitted.</p>
<p>4. Without the permission of the cemetery officer, it is not allowed to build, move or repair the tombstones without authorization.</p>
<p>5. The fees charged by the Public Works Department are as follows:</p>
<p>Cremation (including ordinary cinerary urn and niche) 50 taels.</p>
<p>Cemetery plot: First class 20 taels</p>
<p>Preservation of cemetery plots: 20 taels</p>
<p>Building tombs: Flat roof 5 taels; Round roof 25 taels; Semi-circular roof 12.5 taels</p>
<p>Article 17: Violating the Concession Regulations</p>
<p>Anyone who violates the concession regulations, after being reported by someone (or a local official) to the responsible consul, shall be investigated and punished (either by the consul himself or by someone acting on his behalf). There are two types of penalties: fines shall not exceed 300 yuan, and imprisonment shall not exceed six months. If other punishments are required, they may be considered. If the violator is a person over whom no consul has jurisdiction, the Municipal Council shall report to the consuls (several or one) and send a letter to the Chinese local official for consultation in order to protect the authority of these regulations and to punish the violator.</p>
<p>Article 18: Nominating Municipal Council Directors</p>
<p>Two Westerners who are entitled to participate in the deliberations may nominate a person who meets the regulations (see below) to serve as a Municipal Council director, one as the principal guarantor and one as the secondary guarantor. A guarantee form shall be written, signed, and a statement from the nominee stating their willingness to serve as a director shall be obtained. These documents must be submitted to the Municipal Council manager (or the person specifically designated to handle this matter) for receipt seven days before the date set for the election of directors. On the day of the deadline for receiving the nominations, a clear list of the names of those nominated shall be announced and posted in a public place, and published in the Western newspapers. If the number of those nominated to serve as directors exceeds nine, the incumbent directors shall appoint two people to be responsible for receiving the ballots from the tenants who have property rights at the place designated for the election of directors. The two people appointed by the Municipal Council shall have a register of the names of the tenants who have property rights and are entitled to participate in the deliberations. Each person entitled to participate in the deliberations who is present in person shall be given a ballot (with the names of all those nominated to fill the director positions). They shall circle the names of those they wish to nominate, not exceeding the allotted number of nine, and sign their name. This ballot shall then be placed in a box specifically set up for this purpose by the Municipal Council. From the day the election of directors is set, until the following day (i.e., two consecutive days, from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on the first day, and from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on the second day), the Municipal Council shall convene and specifically appoint two people to open the box and check the ballots, selecting the nine people with the most nominations. These nine people shall be determined to be the incumbent directors. If the number of nominations is exactly within the limit (nine or more, but no less than five), then there is no need to do this (i.e., giving out ballots, signing names, circling names, and placing them in the box), and the list shall be announced to the public, posted, and published in the newspaper on the day following the deadline for receiving the nominations, and the incumbent directors shall be determined. If the number of nominations is less than five (four or less), then on the day following the deadline for receiving the nominations, the incumbent directors shall publish the names of those entitled to participate in the deliberations in the newspaper. On the day of the election, a special meeting shall be convened, and the tenants attending the meeting shall add directors to meet the limit, either by voting or by other means (at least five people). These few people shall be determined to be the incumbent Municipal Council directors.</p>
<p>Article 19: Municipal Council Meeting Participants</p>
<p>Westerners residing in the concession who own property, whether in their own name or in the name of the owner of a business house (all applicable donation items under their name must be paid), shall be permitted to be licensed to participate in the deliberation of director elections and various public meetings, and it is specifically declared that those who are licensed to participate in the deliberation must have a land value of at least 500 taels, and the annual land donation paid, as estimated by the Municipal Council, is at least 10 taels (license fees are not included). Or, those who rent houses and pay donations based on the annual rent estimated by the Municipal Council at more than 500 taels. Only those who hold special written authorization from those who are out of the jurisdiction because of illness are allowed to participate in the deliberation. Those who are qualified to serve as directors must have paid at least 50 taels of annual housing donations under their name, as estimated by the Municipal Council (license fees are not included), or, in the case of leased housing, the annual rent is estimated by the Municipal Council at 1,200 taels and paid by the donor, is a qualified person. Every firm or company entitled to participation shall not issued more than one card. All those eligible to be granted cards are listed in a register kept by the Municipal Council, and the council officials shall promptly check and adjust the number to be increased or decreased from December 1 each year and post it to the public.</p>
<p>Article 20: Filling Vacancies on the Municipal Council</p>
<p>If one or two incumbent directors of the Municipal Council are vacant, not exceeding three, the remaining incumbent directors shall hold a joint meeting (following the precedent of majority rule) to fill the vacancies. If more than three vacancies occur, the election of directors to fill the vacancies must be conducted in full accordance with Article 18.</p>
<p>Article 21: Term Limits for Municipal Council Directors</p>

<h3 id="e155">An Overview of the Features of the 1939 Model Cars Now Arriving in Shanghai <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>European and American Products Are Generally Similar in Principle; British and American Cars Each Excel in Style and Mechanics</p>
<p>Whether in terms of mechanical engineering or body construction, the 1939 model cars, whether made in America, Britain, or continental Europe, have made very significant progress. The new car features are too numerous to mention, but the most noteworthy is the substantial increase in engine performance. The reasons for this success lie in the improved cylinder head, the refined study of intake and exhaust pipes, and the advancements in carburetors and ignition systems. With the new engine performance greatly increased, its operation is more superior, fuel consumption is more economical, and driving is safer and more reliable. In these respects, small cars are the most obviously improved. For example, the acceleration and climbing power of the new 8 and 10 horsepower cars are now approaching those of 15 and 20 horsepower cars. The suspension methods of the new cars have also been greatly improved, the shock absorption devices are excellent, and the frame construction of larger cars is stronger and more solid than before. Many even adopt a mixed construction of body and chassis. Furthermore, both large and small cars are equipped with spacious luggage compartments. If heavy luggage needs to be loaded, simply flatten the rear panel of the car body.</p>
<p>The new cars released by British and American car manufacturers in 1939 place great emphasis on safety. In addition to the design and construction, which pay attention to safety in every aspect, the field of vision of the safety glass windshield has now been increased by 18 to 30 percent, and the driver's field of vision is much wider than before. As a result, traffic accident cases, especially those involving injuries to children, can be greatly reduced. The new-style shift lever mounted on the steering column is another feature of the 1939 model cars. Its position is just below the steering wheel, and its operation is the same as the old style, but it is far more flexible. Manufacturers generally believe that this device is of great importance to driving safety. Drivers can therefore focus their attention on the road without having to constantly pay attention to gear shifting. According to general opinion, the 1939 model cars produced by British and American car manufacturers are essentially the same in principle and largely the same in general. However, in terms of mechanics and style, British and American cars each excel in their own fields. The 1939 model cars have arrived in Shanghai one after another, and a brief description of their general situation is as follows.</p>
<p>(1) The DeSoto Six-Cylinder Car: In terms of mechanical aspects, the new DeSoto car features a new-style transmission, independent front suspension, a new-style high-torque engine, and a new-style shift lever. The body style is magnificent, and the interior is completely new. The air conditioning can be adjusted as desired, allowing for extreme comfort.</p>
<p>(2) The Packard Six-Cylinder Sedan: The 1939 model Packard is not only sophisticated in its mechanism but also extremely beautiful and magnificent in style. The body is made of all steel, absolutely safe, and very spacious. Its outstanding advantages include a new-style shift lever, a new-style transmission, and a special shock absorption device. The comfort of riding and the convenience of driving are far superior to those of the past.</p>
<p>(3) The Studebaker: It is said that the 1939 model Studebaker is the most luxurious and beautiful car sold at a new low price. Its new-style ventilation system allows the air conditioning to be adjusted as desired, greatly enhancing comfort. The body is made of pure steel, which is extremely strong and safe. As for driving, it is very easy to handle, and the consumption of gasoline and engine oil is very economical.</p>
<p>(4) The Dodge Six-Cylinder Car: Dodge products have always been known for their safety and reliability. Now, the 1939 model car is Dodge's silver anniversary product. Its design, construction, equipment, and decoration are all carefully planned to achieve perfection. Therefore, its safety and reliability are superior to those of the past, and it is increasingly welcomed by people in the automotive industry. This is for good reason.</p>

<h3 id="e156">"Winter Protection" for the Automotive World <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Dan Hua</p>
<p>In winter, car owners often worry a lot about their cars, probably because of the severe frost and heavy fog. In fact, driving in winter can be very enjoyable as long as you take proper precautions against ice, snow, frost, and fog. As for preventive measures, they should be considered from two aspects: the car itself and the car garage. What ordinary car owners find difficult are the two inseparable problems of starting and freezing. The difficulty of starting is due to three reasons: the cold air, the sticking of engine oil, and the weakening of the battery. These three difficulties are easy to remedy. To keep the engine and car at a suitable temperature, there are simple and inexpensive methods available for adoption. Car manufacturers often introduce a winter-specific engine oil to car owners, and car owners may wish to follow their advice. The battery power can also be adjusted by oneself when necessary. When the car is driven on the road, there should be a pair of headlights with appropriate focus. A front window wiper is also a necessity.</p>
<p>Insulation in the Car Garage</p>
<p>If the car is left outside for three or four hours, especially at night, there is a risk of freezing. Some antifreeze should be used in the water tank to prevent this. Modern cars often have a thermostat to regulate the engine temperature, or water tank louvers to prevent the engine from cooling down easily. If such equipment is not available, it is best to use a thermal insulation cover instead. If the car is left outside for a long time, covering the engine hood is also useful.</p>
<p>Car Insulation</p>
<p>As for the car garage, there should be a heater. Radiators can be installed along the walls, or simple methods can be used, such as preparing a water tank lamp to keep the water from cooling easily, or installing an oil pan heater to keep the engine oil at a suitable temperature.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to the Battery</p>
<p>The loss of battery power in cold weather is most noteworthy. The preventive method is to use the electricity in the car garage to keep the battery at a certain strength. The cost is limited, and the benefits are great.</p>
<p>Fog Lights and Road Lights</p>
<p>Winter has a lot of heavy fog, so fog lights are extremely important and must be prepared. True fog lights are probably most effective at speeds of 5 to 25 miles per hour. Beyond this limit, the brightness must be increased in normal weather. Due to this limitation, many drivers prefer to use a type of auxiliary light, so it is most effective.</p>
<p>If only one road light is used, it should be installed in the center of the front of the car, parallel to the lower part of the water tank. However, many drivers prefer to use a pair, installed on both sides of the water tank, because sometimes the length of the two lights varies, complementing each other, making them convenient and beautiful to use together.</p>
<p>Long-Distance Ice and Snow Protection</p>
<p>When driving in winter, tires should be of the highest quality, preferably with anti-skid ribs. If the journey is long, heavy snow is inevitable, and road freezing is also expected. Under these circumstances, tire chains are indispensable.</p>
<p>Internal Improvements</p>
<p>In the past, winter driving was often considered a terrible thing because the weather was cold and there were various discomforts in the car, such as fingers and toes taking time to warm up, and the condensation on the front window requiring constant wiping. But now it is different. Heaters can be installed in the car, and drivers do not need to wear thick clothes to feel warm as spring. As for the condensation on the inside of the front window, the latest method is to simply add a wiper, and there is no problem at all.</p>
