<p>社評</p>
<h3>期望於蘇聯</h3>
<p>蘇聯與芬蘭兩國間的嚴重形勢，一日未見消弭，一日不可忽視；一因嚴重的程度不易限制，一因嚴重的範圍不易限制；能消弭，是大幸；不能消弭，勢必更趨惡化而無法抑勒；不能抑勒，大有牽動第三四國而造成歐戰畫時期的局面的可能。弄兵如弄火，結果延擴，每每出乎預料之外。日本發動對華武力侵略，他最初決不料到戰爭兩年半而還是欲罷不能；德國隊波瀾開火，他以為可用和平攻勢打退英法，他最初決不料到西綫不得不準備生命為孤注。以蘇芬局勢而論，兩國報告的糾紛「事實，」逈不相同，未知究竟孰是；但在情理上無法論斷芬蘭竟然主動糾紛，開砲挑釁。乃蘇聯方面不但對於國際宣傳芬蘭挑釁，其意若曰芬蘭應負責任；且對於國內宣傳邊境與安全，竟受芬蘭壓迫，燃起了對芬用兵的熱烈火燄！</p>
<p>以第三國際對於國際抱負的遠大，我們不能想像蘇聯願意親自從事於危險而愚笨的戰爭；如非遭遇了無可忍受的挑釁，如非犧牲了二三千人可得廿萬里地！因此，我們亦不能想像蘇聯此次對於芬蘭願動真刀真槍。事有出乎預料之外的，蘇聯不若既往的沉着，已發動了機關報紙，露天大會，這是動用真刀真槍之前的主要武器；使蘇聯人民感覺到忍無可忍，使蘇聯人民發為「自資本主義的高壓下解放芬蘭人民的宏願。」雖蘇蘭已經表示接受蘇聯的要求，自邊界退兵二十五公里却亦對等要求蘇聯邊防軍的同樣退後。以對等條件排難解紛，似不失為公道，糾紛理應可望消弭，所未可樂觀者，蘇聯最近的國際辭令中，並無對等字樣，故芬蘭的答復，或將使蘇聯認為殊難索解。</p>
<p>蘇聯若果「忍無可忍」而對芬蘭用兵，芬蘭人民若果不待蘇聯所謂英美的鼓勵而能自知自衛，對壘抗戰，則强凌弱，衆暴寡，勝利當然屬於蘇聯。勢在必勝，這是不能斷言於蘇聯必不躬親戰爭的重要論據，雖然我們却又殷願蘇聯鄭重考慮，蓋戰事若果一鼓而下，事極簡單；但芬蘭自由藩籬，而天時地利，或使蘇聯不免遭遇相當困難；何況用兵之時，乃至戰勝之後，行將直接間接誘致國際種種必然的後果。以目前而論：英法德交戰，是國際問題中的一環，蘇芬糾紛是其又一環，雖每一環各有其重心，各有其個別解決的可能，然惡化與延擴之結果，歐洲將成洪鑪，融合為一；蘇聯屆時便成個中一員，非復超越環境而得舉足重輕。蘇聯對芬蘭可能的成　，或比對波瀾的成就為尤大；蘇聯對芬蘭的意義，或視為無異於對波瀾；但所予國際的印象，亦即國際所作的估價，則兩事絕不相同；蘇聯即使蔑視國際印象與估價，但所反應於今後各國對蘇聯態度者，必將使蘇聯自身感覺新窒礙。自前數年以迄最近，國際種種動態之下，國與國相比較，凡參加　奪者，或已證實其失敗，或已暴露其頹勢，或在拼命搏擊的中途而勝敗存亡未可知也；惟有美國在美洲是成功者，蘇聯在歐洲是優勝者；日本德國迷信暴力而爭霸，却自註定了悲慘的命運；即使謂日德至今未可斷言為既敗，至少目前業已自陷於水深火熱之中！要知溫和的懷抱，猙獰的面貌，決非異曲同功，決非各有千秋；同時又必知生存與自由乃人類必然的願望，弱小民族決非下賤動物。因此種種，我們為蘇聯打算，與其變更作風，追踪德國，不辭跳入油鍋，企圖芬蘭；寗若葆養真誠，發揮真理，務期實踐歷年援助弱小之標揭，而以伸張正義，恢復和平為已任！</p>
<h3>日侵華軍隊不撤　美日商約難望續訂　美民衆喉舌之正義呼聲　反日會作全國廣大宣傳　促請政府禁軍用品運日</h3>
<p>紐約　紐約「每日新聞」報昨日社評中聲稱、「美政府取消一九一一年所訂美日商約之舉、已使美國對於遠東問題之談判、獲得較優越之地位、現時機已經成熟、美政府必須通知日本、續訂美日商約之代價、余等必須利用此時機、使日本就範、日本若欲繼續美日貿易關係、必須先將侵華軍隊撤退」、紐約「每日新聞」為全美銷數最大之報、此社論頗可代表美國民意改變之一斑、蓋一年以前、該報曾為文促政府對遠東採取放任政策者也、（二十八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>紐約　美國「反日本侵略」委員會昨日宣稱彼等將舉行全國廣大宣傳、促政府頒佈命令禁止將軍火原料等物售與日本、此委員會主席為前國務卿史汀生、新贊助人之名單中、計有前美國亞洲艦隊司令雅納爾大將，前美國商會主席哈例曼·此委員會對參院外交委員會主席舉德曼所將提出之停止對日通商提議、將加以熱烈贊助、（二十八日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>渝各團體　電波拉呼籲正義　日軍閥以美國軍火　侵略中國屠殺平民</h3>

<h3>談新技擊</h3>
<p>— 查瑞龍</p>
<p>自我硏究新技擊以來、將近十年了、深信新技擊確爲近代中國民族練習武藝最適用的一種術科、於是不但自信目學、並且欲以提倡新技擊爲己任、願揭出研究的心得、貢獻於有志於體育的諸君、</p>
<p>應該首先說明的、新技擊與洋拳不同、新技擊與國術中各種老法拳術亦有異、乾脆地說吧，新技擊就是改良而合實用的拳術、</p>
<p>談到洋拳、牠是附有營業作用的、有一種特別規則所限定、若眞與他人搏擊時、如果對方用脚猛踢、往往收走無疑、這就是牠『不够應用』的短處、</p>
<p>至於我國拳術、派別甚多、方法亦五花八門、論其動作和姿勢、雖甚佳、不過太偏重理想、而不能滿足實際應用時的需要、並且易學難精、譬如初學駕駛摩托卡、雖經指導者講解至一月或一年之久、但學者一經實地駕駛、一定不能如你所想像的容易、由是以覜、習拳術者必須將平時練習與臨陣制敵打成一片、如何練習、即如何應用、決無練習的方法是如此、而實幹時的動作又如彼的流弊　然後才可以算是恰到好處了、</p>
<p>新技擊誠然是新技擊、牠能手足並用、牠能怎樣練習、就怎樣實施牠是一個『說到做到」『理論與實騐相同的一種武術、確是强身制敵近代適用的新技擊、把他的最顯著的優點、分列於</p>
<p>（一）練習方法很簡單、一經指導便易踏上正軌、</p>
<p>（二）實習或比賽時、御手套腹帶、交一于時無失手之虞、</p>
<p>（三）交手時儘管振作精神進攻猛擊、無須顧及對方使用何種拳法、隨時隨地可以應用、</p>
<p>（四）練習後身體各部能牛均發展不致有畸形發育之弊、這不過簡要地說明、至於詳細的內容、在我的已經編著將近刋佈的那本新技擊的書中、有着詳盡合乎實際的理論與指導、</p>
<p>在南洋各地、曾經和我研究過新技擊的同志、不下百餘人、經騐吿訴我、確有奇效、不敢自秘、謹以至誠把這種嶄新的新技擊的意見、約略寫幾句、呈在體育界諸同仁之前、同時敬候諸先進嚴正的批評和切實的指敎</p>

<p>米市還傳各路來源突稀、祗有蘇同崑太等貨二十餘車抵埠、惟久已告絕之河下貨、昨忽到有南港帮八艘、乃有楓靑等一帶又有阻碍不得運申之說、一時交頭接耳、互相吿詢、出售者欲待良機、不肯輕脫、均鮮出樣、昨晨內地帮及本鄕店舖一般實胃、獨見活躍、而客販亦殊歡迎、以實胃去路、出貨迅速、且屬現金交易、不茶投機家及囤戶之延宕呆攔、故願意遷就、行情只提二三角、孰料一般投機家、均認爲空氣之效能、私慶得計、以爲操縱之時機已至、遂大出其魔手、從中作祟、相偕囤戶、一方將獲利之貨一味猛抬、紛紛拋出、一方遍搜較廉之貨、放價拉進、客販亦誤認良好之機會、未肯放鬆、遂亦羣　猛喊、若常特粳竟越大關達四十一二元之高峰、於是逾越正軌、但眞偽易別、事實難達、且下滬棧存貨旣豐、且洋米雖以市價難合又吿停訂、然已成之數亦巨、除業已抵埠者外、途次尙有絡續將到、一般實胃心思、不若投機家專圖牟利、甘冒風險、素抱穩健主義、可進則進、不則甘願袖手、茲旣市面復混、價格失準、頓感棘手、遂均見機轉舵、觀望不進、銷塲突現呆木、同時執於北洋帮手中之巨數洋米、續在拋出、旣見市面失勢、亦即將早市升自卅五元半之西貢、鬆售至卅四元半、一般投機者處此環境、獰遭洋米當頭一棍、且實胃已滯、頓感失其作用、無法操縱、祇得垂頭喪氣、迄收市一路平平、終乏振作結果收槃以早先一轟誠烈、至此雖疲、無論粳尖行情、仍較前市提升半元至一元不等、總計統市成交數有近萬包、</p>
<p>客秈昨日到頭蟬聯、前後到有六千多包、貨方看好多未出樣且洋米定價報漲、人心更爲望好、兼之客囤納胃甚貪、投機尤爲活躍、價乃突昂元外、後市實消轉寂、浮多與獲利客囤回出、市始回軟、然高客秈仍須卅四元半、成交的近三千包、</p>

<p>麥市趨勢、繼長增高、扶搖直上、蓋因內地產價、既被米價帶高、來源更見减少、貨方心意益堅、最高麥須售十二元之價、昨已創紀錄、市塲行囤吸收甚烈、各廠亦不得不放價收辦、統市廠辦共一萬八千包、棧交貨共有十五六車、價由十二元决至十一元五角六分、市面尙有看高之勢、</p>

<h3>金融　連漲五日後　金市昨起小反動</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、晨初依然堅俏、蓋承上數日之餘風、且匯市報縮、加以某金號放盤狂抬、致開市竟昂達三千九百三十五元爲全日高峯價、但不久聞天津匯兌報緊、津帮託某錢兌業扒入、奈匯市突然步鬆、加以證券帮大量售出、現金號與銀樓帮莫不脫售於市、實難站定原狀、一度曾盤小至三千八百六十元低盤、嗣以證券帮獲利復進若干、迨至午刻收盤價已好上十元、爲三千八百七十元、午後因匯市復軟化、一開即昇二十元、未幾又盤起五元、其時證券帮反來搜買、錢兌業亦有搶入、惟不意某錢兌業忽然出籠、及其他如證券帮等重復吐出、價突跌落至三千八百六十一元、雖某金號撈進若干、提高十餘元、惟結果祇二千八百七十元、較隔昨尙回落十元、交易仍旺、約二千兩之譜、銀樓飾金掛小五元、海關金仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤軋小十元</p>
<p>目晨每條（十兩）、初開承上數日之餘威、且外匯晨開即軟、喊買者曾見一度緊張、某金號較其他尤烈、延至九時三十分開市、竟在抬五十五元、某金號進證券帮二十兩、爲三千九百三十五元、詎料開後現金號乘高吐出、而匯市已止緊回硬、某余號吃胃頓淡、一霎間回落三十元、現余號吐予某錢兌業一十兩、爲三千九百〇五元、時某錢兌業繼續吸入、步高十五元、某錢兌業進銀樓帮十兩、爲三千九百二十元、此後證劵帮多頭前來出籠、且現金號仍有塞出、復回小二十五元、證券帮吐予錢兌業五十兩、爲三千八百九十五元、嗣因某金號買意復萌、散戶亦跟風買入、遂又高至三千九百二十元、旋以滙市續見回平、證券帮與錢兌業爭先吐售、同時銀樓帮亦頻來套賣、加以買方吃胃又淡、價遂猛落六十元、錢兌業賣予某銀號二十兩、爲三千八百六十元、將近午刻、外匯轉平、證券帮獲利稍來復進、拉起二十二元、證券帮進金號三十兩、爲三千八百八十一元、後因某錢兌發反代浮戶吐出、步小十二元、銀樓帮售予現金號一十兩、爲三千八百七十元作午收價、午後初開、因匯市報軟、加以證券帮與錢兌業競相放盤吸收、開市即在抬二十元、證券帮進銀樓帮十兩、爲三千八百九十元、後某金號與某錢兌業前來拋出、立小十元、錢兌業吐予證券帮二十兩、爲三千八百八十元、時證券帮繼續拉提、且賣者稍缺、復抬起十五元、證券帮進某金號三十兩、爲三千八百九十五元、入後某錢兌業多頭復來出籠、且證券帮等亦來求售、加以外匯其時已止緊轉平、買戶吃胃奇淡、不久即猛撳三十四元、錢兌業吐予某金號三十兩、爲三千八百六十一元、後某命號獲利補進、回起十七元、某金號進錢兌業二十兩、爲三千八百七十八元、將近收盤時、某錢兌業塞出數十兩、遂再撳小八元、錢兌業互做二十兩、爲三千八百七十元作晚收價、結果比上日軋小十元、全天七十五元上落、現金號之本脾金售出、價照烚赤高十元、收進的减小二十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元之譜、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金掛低五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸三百九十五元、迨至正午掛小五元、此後無變化，結果大同行改懸三百九十元　新同行與上價相同、收進均减小十五元光景、</p>
<h3>匯市寗靜</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、悉無變動、英美滙暗市、已不若前昨變動之大、潛勢略已轉定、但人心仍感杌揑小安、初市以猶太投機商喬直甫扒進、致開後緊中再吿微縮、嗣因港電肯塞、投機商不乏吐出、雖沙遜與有利間來吸收、終以供過於求、遂轉鬆硬時英金吿四辦士八四三七五、美滙達七元九〇六二五、旋乃有利吃胃稱旺、午收時已微吿回緊、爲四辦士八二八一二五、及七元八七五、後市趨勢又形軟化、蓋有利續有吃胃、况於買賣沉寂中、頭寸感缺、英金復緊至四辦士七八一二五、美滙又現七元八一二五、終有錢兌業稍出若干、故而轉平、迄收盤止、未稍變史、收盤價爲四辦士八一二五及七元八四三七五、較上日英金勿動美滙則軋縮〇三一二五、乃美英滙兌續降七五之故、至期貨市面與現貨相仿、</p>
<p>喬直甫首先結進</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條均平、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美·對法俱平、對滬縮一二五、美對英降七五、對滬跌一角半對法小一分、中央掛牌各滙如奮、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士七八一二五、美滙七元七八一二五、較上日美比英爲緊、英計〇三一二五、美計〇九三七五、乃滙兌降落之故，開後猶太商喬直甫首來扒進華比現貨英金四辦士七五、時美滙亦軟至七元七五、不久華商前來塞予外行現貨美滙七元八一二五、爲狀遂稍回平、滙豐掛脾揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無升降、此後杳港帮亦未賣出、且華商續有拋售、雖沙　與有利乘機吸入、奈頭寸仍感充盈、故市象繼續回平、計港帮與美行大通吐予有利沙遜等現貨美滙七元八七五及九〇六二五、繼而港帮又與華商售予沙遜及有利等外行現貨英金四辦士八一二五、與八四三七五、將近午刻、有利吃　轉旺、是以爲狀遂略帶耿、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士八二八一二五、美滙七元八七五、比晨開英　〇四六八七五、美回硬〇九三七五、</p>
<p>收盤英平美略緊</p>
<p>後市初時賣者頗缺、且有利仍有吃胃、致市況　中略形帶軟、英金至四辦士七八一二五、美滙述七元八一二五、入後錢兌業前來賣予大通美金票爲七元八七五、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士八一二五、美滙七元八四三七五、十二月份英金四辦士七五、美滙七元七一八七五、結果比上日現期英均未分軒輊、美則俱略緊〇三一二五、</p>

<h3>金鎊金票回降</h3>
<p>昨日外幣、英美金鎊、需要趨稀、市况鬆降、英美金票、市價軟弱、美金票初步堅挺，曾漲達十二元九角、嗣客戶供給踴躍、市價頻軟、晚市降　十二元五角、法郎票需要甚旺，市價堅俏、日金票　市爲一元二角五分五厘、朝鮮票亦軟弱、晚市爲一元一角三分五厘、昨日市價、英美金鎊、俱降五角、英金票降二角、美金票降五分、法郞票升八厘、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>
<h3>證券　內債漲跌互見</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市況萎靡不振、隔日一度興奮、人心復歸於恍惚、一班跟風頭之散空、隔日因市價先漲後跌、乃亦由多翻空、昨日做開听跌有限、乃亦紛紛抵補、故丙種七元進關後復又穿出七元關、市價賴以托住、此種隨波逐流之浮空抵補、並非正式做多加碼、故脚地依然浮而不實也、昨日上午初開、市價較低、丙種在七元內開盤後、以浮空抵補、冉行穿出七元、查七元關內外盤旋已經多决變化尙在其後、午後初堅後疲、上落史微、補空交易稍稍點綴而已、市價結果高低互見爲數不出五分一角、成交總數約計五十萬之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交商務印書館股少數、價為六十七元七角半</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所　股市潛勢堅强大衆興趣、較前數日已見減少、橡皮股亦堅、雖交易稀少、各股問津、頗不乏人、</p>
<p>本埠匯通洋行經理之敲老佛及英古達除兩橡皮有限公司均經各該公司董事會議決、定於十二月十二日開派一九三九年份第一次中期股息、敲老佛每股續派國幣五分（連第一次戶派國幣五分兩共已派國幣一角、）英古達除每股續派國幣二角、（連第一次巳派國幣二角、兩共已派國幣四角）、</p>

<h3>紗花　粗紗交易不弱</h3>
<p>上日大漲之紗市、昨復入平靜之途、實緣外滙梢平和、同時海外孟買棉市漲風已戢、惟美棉仍堅定、人心安寗、不若上日之熱烈、又受小良影饗之牽制、上漲力似遭阻礙、但港帮仍以港幣轉升、粗紗納胃尙健、惟細紗需要沉寂、浙東方面、亦不及疇昔之活潑、所以紗市未克繼續前進、不過原棉尙堅昂耳、</p>
<p>現紗農開、同業人氣尚好、貿者心意未濃、二十支雙馬價爲六百八十元、漲二元、詎料價格一高、獲利多方乘機吐出、檯面忽鬆、同時外滙開出無大變遷、跌至六百七十一元、旋以客方粗紗交易尚稱不弱、又復回上幾元、查半日間成交一千四百五十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌三元、雙地球跌三元、天女跌二元、廠方由申新二廠開出二十支天女七百包、價爲六百七十元、又申新九廠開出十支紅雙馬五百包、價為五百元、補前次五百八十元之情、而當日將前閒之五百八十元紗掃數墊淸、今日有紗九十一件運厦門、七十五件運香港、五件運海口、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<h3>通花喊價　到一百五十元</h3>
<p>本棉交易、尙稱不弱、同行買賣佔多數、廠辦平常、然存貨不厚、故紗廠雖不吃、人心堅挺如　、廠銷如果一動、漲　將不可抑止、所以一般同行收藏心思益濃、棉市基礎較紗市爲昂、惟印棉漲風已戢、美棉亦屬和緩、棉價尙可拉平一步、通花喊價一百五十元、成交爲一百四十九元、比上日仍漲一四元、太倉花已到一百十六元、蘇北來源稍旺、計到通花五千二百三十八包、北沙來二千一百六十包、又一百六十包運杳港、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初開盤、即形堅定、投機者乘機購買、現貨商及紐奧綸斯帮俱在市購買、因之造成最高價收盤、較之上日行市漲起八九磅音、印度連同預測漲起三羅比餘、埃及跌落四十餘磅音、利物浦無甚軒輊、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來殊爲靜寂、各方以滙兌變化莫測、故均畏縮不前、廠方以存底尙可應付、定貨亦已絡繹裝運在途、故對於目前原棉採購問題、異常淡薄、日方廠方日來亦殊靜寂、終日竟無只包交易、</p>
<h3>疋頭　綸昌復工後　首批出品售開</h3>
<p>國布銷路不暢、同業獲利轉售、港帮南洋帮因滙兌關係、採辦較前有利、交易轉旺、而廠方期貨開價均昂、故現貨市盤呈盤旋之勞、港帮辦細布細斜一百餘件、粗布·粗斜近百件、南洋帮辦漂布·漂斜·印花布五千餘疋、本街同業及囤戶成交細斜·細布·粗布三百餘件、絨布·色布·印花貨一萬餘疋、英商綸昌廠復工後、昨開售首批出品、藍布·花布·直貢緞·漂布五種、計成交五十餘箱、　本街批發號承購、</p>

<h3>日海軍陸戰隊　竟執行捕房警權　通告虹口楊樹浦居民　遇罪案報告日軍部隊　警務處當局表示遺憾</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、據日文大陸新報載稱、駐滬日本海軍陸戰隊司令武田海軍少將、星期一日請虹口與楊樹浦之平民合作、防杜該西區内之罪行、並逮捕罪犯、武田切言解決罪行之關鏈、厥在</p>
<p>迅速報告</p>
<p>該西區居民如遇罪案、可發電話報告日防軍司令部與虹口、中央及東區日軍隊部云、記者今（二十八日）晨探悉、公共租界警務處對於武田之籲請事、未接通知、警務處認爲武田未將警務處電話號碼、列入上述表內、</p>
<p>實屬遺憾</p>
<p>解決罪行之眞正關鍵、乃在任警務處從事偵查、蓋此乃警務人員之工作、而非水兵之任務也、水兵雖能協助警務處、但未受</p>
<p>偵查罪案</p>
<p>之訓練、警務處在蘇州河北岸所派警員人數與控制權、難仍因日方盤踞該區而受限制、但警務處仍能解決蘇州河北岸之罪案、近如捕獲在塘山路擊斃日人之暴徒、即其一例、</p>
<h3>英商會主席　昨訪問加藤　以商業問題為談話中心　並未討論其他特殊事件</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、上海英商會主席馬歇爾爵士、今（二十八日）晨赴百老匯大廈訪日本特使加藤、作禮節上之拜會、聞兩氏會晤、始於今晨九時三十分、歷一小時十五分鐘、密切注意邇來上海外交談判趨勢之覜察家相信馬歇爾爵士與加藤今晨晤談、所討論者、以此間英國之種種商業問題爲中心、但據加藤答覆記者問話、稱「並未討論特殊情事」、此外、拒不續發言論、馬歇爾爵士對於會晤日使事、亦守緘默、僅稱、「比乃友誼的訪間性質、談話甚爲普通一、</p>
<h3>加拿大皇后號　改運輪艦</h3>
<p>英國昌興輪船公司郵船「加拿大皇后」號、原定下月一日由香港駛抵上海、大中社記者昨從航業界可恃方面獲悉、該輪業奉英國海軍部令、改爲運輸艦、不復如期來滬、按加拿大皇后號輪載重二萬一千五百噸、長六百四十四英尺、爲昌興公司最大之郵船、</p>
<h3>法官·律師　竟遭意外威脅　恐怖份子分別發恐嚇信　法官寓所門前插有匕首　工部局已採取嚴密防范</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今（二十八日）晨得悉、江蘇高等法院第二分院刑庭長郁華、星期四日在善鐘路遭暴徒殺害後、已往數日內、即有恐怖份子發恐嚇信致兩租界內華方法院之法官兩人及工部局法律組之律師、函內有關於郁華被殺而捕獲之人、於起訴時、接信人若參加訴訟、則將</p>
<p>喪失生命</p>
<p>等語、警務處業已派出警員、保護該兩法官與工部局律師聞諸可靠方面、公共租界特一法院某法官、近在其寓所前門上發現揷有匕首一柄、該法官僅將此事報吿捕房、而照常進行其職務、法租界內江蘇高等法院第三分院某法官、</p>
<p>昨未出庭聞該法官亦接得匿名恐嚇信、其職位與郁華相同、若郁華係因政治原因而被暗殺者、則該法官今遇相類之危險矣、工部局法律組（主任爲白里安氏）外之走廊內、當局已加派</p>
<p>巡捕駐守</p>
<p>並特派巡捕、保護出席特區法院辦理起訴法律之高級律師數人、關於郁華被殺害案、警務處尙未捕獲人犯之說、今晨未能獲得證實、據法律界人士指稱、恐怖份子對於兩租界內起訴罪犯之制度、未予顧及、例如法租界內發生暗殺案、則</p>
<p>捕獲罪犯</p>
<p>常解交法租界特二法院、而非江蘇高等法院第三分院或公共和界之特一法院、接得恐嚇信之兩法官與工部局律師所執行職務之法院、與特二法院之訴訟、並無關係、</p>
<h3>吳光新靈柩　昨日抵滬　暫厝上海殯儀館</h3>

<h3>四日內洋米進口　四萬八千餘包　昨嘉應輪運到一萬三千餘包　蘇州輪亦運到一萬四千餘包</h3>
<p>近日米價又復上漲、人心甚形恐惶、考其原因、皆受謠言所惑、實際上來源不斷、查各米店存米充足、况近日洋米亦源源而來、非但價格未見减低、反連日高漲、又將至上月之最高峯、對於漲價原理實屬莫測、至洋米進口、四日內已有四萬八千包餘到滬、計二十五日太古公司四川輪、運來洋米二萬零六百五十八包、昨晨嘉應輪到滬、由香港裝來一萬三千六百五十七包、又蘇州輪於昨日傍晚進口、亦由香港運來一萬四千五百三十五包、現正在起卸中、聞尙有大批隨後運到、</p>
<p>米市加派值日委員</p>
<p>新聲社云、滬市米糧來源近日有增無减、米棧存底頗見增加、堆存香港貢米亦絡續裝輪運滬、惟米蠹貧心未戢、竟大量扒進、以致造成米價騰漲局勢、現租界當局按日派員赴米行茶會市塲監視、並嚴密調查造謠市儈、米市塲管理委員會　日加派委員値日、維持市塲秩序、並嚴厲執行（一）掮客代客居問之營業、祇准售與市塲同業之行號、（二）代客經售之客貨、祇准售與市塲同業之米行、（三）米號購進之米、應向在塲同業之米行購買、在市塲買賣均須現貨交易、不得買空賣空、以維整個民食、</p>
<p>米業觀察米價趨勢</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨晨　時赴米行茶會市塲、當時因人心向上、繼續看高、結果復漲四五角不等、惟據某米業領袖談稱、照目前國米來源情勢觀察、米價日內必將回跌、所謂「搬運證」均已接洽就緒、現各帮米糧販商甫在分頭採辦、日昨抵滬者以秈米爲大宗、粳貨市上納胃較遜、然大批秈貨尙在運滬途中、一俟抵埠進棧、屆時人心勢趨下游、米價不折而自墜、</p>

<h3>一幅刧後流亡圖—貧民窟火災後慘狀—</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>大火燒和寒天好像不可分離的，天愈冷，火警愈多。在上海，尤其是貧民窟，所謂棚戶區域，一燒總是幾十間，甚至幾百間。今年，延平路上的棚戶，又首先遭遇大火燒的慘劇了。</p>
<p>禮拜六那天，突然奇冷，風那麽緊吹着，使每一個人在喊吃不消。午後有些事情出去，看見各區的救火車，下了緊急令，在康腦晚路上開過。走近延平路的地方，已可望見黑炯透起天空，高到半天裏，使任何人可看出火勢是不小。看熱鬧的人在蜂擁似的跟着救火車跑去，而這裏面，間有幾個老婦人，一邊在哭泣，一邊在在喊「不好了！完啦！」使人看出她們的家是遭了回祿之災。</p>
<p>第二天的早上，我就特地到延平路去，想尋找火燒的地方，作一决巡禮。問了人，才知道就在申園的隔壁，打一條弄堂裏進去，不多路就發現了這火燒塲，烟火的氣味還很濃厚，一陣陣透進我的鼻官。這裏有上百間棚戶，全是用稻草和蘆席搭成的房屋，矮得長人走不進去。經過了這决的大火，燒去了六十多間，還有幾十間得以倖免，更幸虧在白天，祇燒死一個孩子。</p>
<p>在火燒塲上，東一堆黑灰，西一堆餘燼，娘抱着孩子，坐在燒剩的泥牆下面，缸，甕，鍋子，這些東西沒有被火燒掉，零亂的倒在地上，大哭小喊，家是失去了。有好多女人，正在一邊哭泣，一邊抓取餘燼中的東西。男子們掮了燒剩的衣物，搬向別處去棲宿。一幅流亡圖，使人目覩之下，禁不住墮下同情之淚！</p>
<p>隨便的和幾個人閒談了一下，知道火是隔鄰的一個包飯作起的，人雖不燒死，棚戶們養的猪是燒死了幾頭。這些貧民都是戰後打滬東，閘北一帶，逃進租界，在申園的鄰近，找到了空地，才搭起棚子來棲宿的。以職業說來，男的多半是車夫，苦力，和小販，女的縫窮或做工，孩子們好多是在拾荒，生活當然相常苦。</p>
<p>有一個棚戶感慨的吿訴我，這年頭米珠薪桂，平日本屬活命爲難，不圖遭此火災，今後不但難找其他的屋子，就是在原處蓋屋，也沒有錢，一家多口，經此一燒，竟有無處去歸宿的苦衷。使我聽了非常難過。</p>
<h3>遇過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天翼</p>
<p>第十八會　談經濟繁榮興舊市　述婚姻掠奪奪溯遺風</p>
<p>邵慧華道：『當然！沒有那樣的時代，中國的進步，也許沒有如此快。凡事都是相激相盪，纔有了種種的變化。中國的俗語：呌做「吃一次虧學一次乖。」當時我們以爲這樣一座房子，要頂費三千元，未免不合算。再到別地方去尋尋看，誰知別地方也是一樣。也有一種做投機性質的，租了一塊大地皮，零碎造屋，給你訂一個合同，請你付出一萬八千的租價。訂定十五年；二十年約期限，到了期限，他們把你從前付出的一萬元，八千元，全盤選你。這個法子，倒是一個聰明法子，而目可以兩不吃虧。要是有誠實的商行，或是靠得住的銀行家，倒是好的。不過我們等不到，要等他們的房子造好，不知何年何月。而且他們那房子造價的低廉，路途的窵遠，也就可想而知。不得已還是到從前索頂費三千元的地方去問問吧。誰知相隔不到一星期，早於兩三日之前，有人早以三千元頂去了。後來我們實在無法，只得以九十元一月的租價，租了人家一個三層樓全面，附屬一個亭子間，便是上海人所謂三房客了。二房東限制甚嚴，電燈只能點到十二點鐘。自來水除每日開放三次外，其餘的時間，都鎖起來。打電話每决五分，現錢交易。我們借住了他們的房子，好像是託人宇下，只好忍氣呑聲。可是到了戰事一停，逃難到上海來的，都搬回到內地去了。因爲有許多人家，在內地自己都有房子，何必到上海來，住這個逼仄所在呢？那時上海　五百萬人口，顯然降落到二百萬人口也不到。所有以前很擠的住屋，全都空起來了。馬路上的電桿木，全都貼滿了召租。報紙上的短行廣吿，全都登滿了招租吿白。我們那時以五十塊錢，租住了一處很寬敞的四層大樓。但是我們在內地，也有房廊，也有工作，我們就有一所屋子，在杭州的西湖邊，帆影接窗。山光到枕，我們爲什麽不去住呢？這個時候，上海的地產家，眞是一敗塗地。把地皮房屋賣給人家，人家也不要，把地產到銀行裏去做押款，銀行家也謝絕。爲什麼呢？有了屋子沒有人住，旣不能收到房租，那地價自然跌落下來了。』　（二〇八）</p>
<p>生活報告</p>
<h3>深淵下的伙伴們</h3>
<p>— 曉</p>
<p>每一决那些外國輪船進口的時候，碼頭上總是早已聚着許多的人在佇候。你們自然知道那些人們是有關員和工人等，但是我在這裏要吿訴你們的是：另外的一羣人們。</p>
<p>那羣人都是二三十歲的伙伴，有穿工裝的，也有穿破舊的西裝的。他們聚在碼頭的一角，個個都懷着興奮的希望交談着：</p>
<p>『聽說這决船上的水手都要調換呢！我想我一定可以有機會了。我做了十年的水手，完全是熟手，準有希望！』</p>
<p>『但是不知道船匕的生火要換幾個呢？』</p>
<p>原來那些外國輪船上僱用的下級船員（水手和生火）都是中國人。洋老闆的算盤打得很精細：因爲中國人的工資低賤呀！船到上海後，就忙着安排那些伙伴們，辭退不幹的趕緊補換新人，工作偷懶的自然也得調換；而這些「大權」是操在那些伙伴們的頭目的手中的。於是有許多人跟頭目說情，希望能得到一個位置。這樣忙了一陣，把新和老的伙伴們都安排好了，頭目就帶領他們去受醫生的檢騐體格，許多沒有「入選」的伙伴們在此又懷着一點希望：</p>
<p>『也許有身體騐不上的吧？那小子就是剛生花柳病才好的呢！』</p>
<p>等到體格檢騐過去之後，一切可以說定當了。於是第二天先發每人工資一月。這件事似乎相當嚴重，頭目在伙伴們面前威嚴地說：</p>
<p>『知道嗎？先發一個月薪工。上手（熟手）工鈿是三十塊錢，下手（生手）是十五塊錢！第一個月各人統統只可拿一半，知道嗎？』</p>
<p>是的，那些伙伴們是都知道的：那是「規炬」呀！聽說當一個頭目也不容易的，那個不是化了本錢來的！再，聽說公司裏發下來的工資不止三十塊錢一個呢，那裏還有什麼上手下手！但是爲了生活，誰也小敢反抗頭目的權威和利益，默默地，那些伙伴們就一次一次的載出去，又帶回來。</p>
<p>回來，他們自然是有日子回來的，因爲輪船是定期的。可是回到上海後，許多伙伴們又被頭目辭退了，爲什麽呢？</p>
<p>『我自己明白的！』一個被辭退的伙伴說：『因爲我小喜歡賭錢呀！頭目希望整日整夜的打撲克，他有頭錢可抽哪！我們不賭的幾個自然是受他的白眼，工作稍慢了些就被他駡，活該！那些日夜賭錢的朋友呢，頭目待他們當然客氣些，可是你看看他們的工資單，看！』</p>
<p>看！那些嗜賭的伙伴們的工資單上寫得多淸楚：一年工資共應多少，途中已借用多少，欠人多少，此外什麽費什麼捐應付多少，總結一下，什麽？苦苦的做了一年回來，只存下三只老洋！有的甚至反欠頭目的錢呢，因爲他輸得太多了</p>
<p>這些伙伴們是永遠在深淵下的，永遠是一個窮光棍！他們只是一羣深淵下的奴隸而已</p>
<p>有誰想到他們嗎？那些可憐的奴隸啊！</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>前進的藝人與觀眾們　應愛護游藝界的真精神</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>游藝界的每一個部門，無論是評劇話劇，或者是歌唱與播音，他們都與我們的生活，有着極密切的關係。無可否認地，一齣意識偉大，劇情緊凑的戲劇，或是一曲熱烈的，動人的歌曲，他們都會給我們以一種像濃咖啡樣地興奮劑；即使是一個目不識丁的人，只要他看了十塲充滿着民族的正義感的戲劇之後，一股熱烈的愛國情緒，是不由得被激動起來的。</p>
<p>我們不必說別的，單在上海的游藝界方面談談吧。卡爾登周信芳先生主演的一煤山恨一，正不知道已經感動了幾萬人呢，我們看了崇禎帝的悲傷的境遇，看了他的憂憤的心緒，我們的心是如何地感動啊。同樣現在在璇宮劇院演出的「明末遺恨」（即碧血花），也令人看了之後，自然而然地會發生一種愛國的情緒。我們由此明白用游藝的方式來灌輸給每一個人，才是最深刻的，才是最不易忘却的；所以無怪乎有人說用戲劇，用歌曲來宣傳正義，來激勵人心，它所獲得的結果，是遠在那般單調的說敎以上。</p>
<p>我們切不可視游藝力是一種消極的所謂「娛樂」呀！演出的人，根本就不應該抱定了那種隨隨便便的態度，而在觀衆方面呢，同樣也不該當它只是一種「消遣一的，「尋求快樂」的東西。由於遊藝界每一個部門所給予我們人類的影響的深而且鉅，我們是應該共同地起來　護游藝，發揚光大那種游藝界所獨有的精神。</p>
<p>我們誠然對那些愛護游藝界的藝人與觀衆致敬，但回頭看看吧，在此時此地的上海，忽略了遊藝的宗旨，而在利用着它當作麻醉人心的工具的，正不知還有多少呢！專以肉來號召觀衆的裸舞，至今尙在這里出現，而一般觀衆呢，也好像情願擁向那裏去以求一刻的刺激—就在這般人的蹂躪之下，游藝的純正的精神是被損壞了。</p>
<p>我們冉看看：重慶游藝界的熱烈，它們每一個部門的演出，可以說都是以民族，國家爲前提的，它們鼓動了內地成千成萬的民衆的愛國情緒：它們還激起了我們每一個人的正義感……難道在上海，我們就不可以這樣地幹一番嗎，不錯，上海的處境是不自由的，但是，就連「絕不用游藝來麻醉人心」這一條消極方面的條件還做不到嗎？我個人就希望：那一　始終在重視着游藝的真精神的藝人與觀衆，他們能够更廣大地，更積極地努力做去，我們務必使上海的全個游藝界也會慢慢地從淫逸糜爛的深淵中淸醒過來，向着前面光明的目標邁步前進！我們務必消除在這路上的一切阻礙—那些在利用着游藝的面目以麻醉人心的一羣！前進的藝人們呀！努力！</p>

<h3>我對電影院的建議</h3>
<p>— 蘆蘋</p>
<p>我是一個愛看電影者，但，在我找電影看的時候，往往發生很多的困難：第一是到那一個電影院裏去，第二是那一個電影院的片子才合我胃口，於這二點，我就很冒昧的來向一部份的電影院提出這個建議。</p>
<p>誰都知道凡是電影觀衆，他們底對象各有不同，有緊張的，熱烈的，喜樂的，悲哀的……有注重情節的，注重畫面的，有注重結構的；…我們不論狹與廣，認爲看到說明書去買票比未看到說明書去買票總是有興趣得多。（報紙上的廣吿不過吸引難得看電影的一羣。）</p>
<p>至於如何去使觀衆看到說明畫呢？那是再簡單也沒有了，只要某張影片，在開映的某戲院的門首或壁上，用適當的方法，將說明書用比較大的字跡懸貼起來，旣經濟又省時，實在有一試的價值，深望各影戲院注意及之。</p>
<h3>閒談鋼絲絃二胡</h3>
<p>— 渴雲樓主</p>
<p>鋼絲絃二胡，本佐奏粵曲之樂器，雖同為二胡，然其構造方面較諸普通綫絃二胡，稍有不同。愚性耽樂理，閒來無事，曾異想天開，以普通之綫絃二胡，換以鋼絲絃，獨坐斗室，抑揚奏來，風趣別繞。爰成此文聊供同好。</p>
<p>鋼絲絃在五金店均有出售，惟須簇新無疵，無一處　曲，或現黑點者，浸入沸水，再置於冷水中片刻，取而用之，不易　折，（貨以德國出品最佳）否則音即有變，雖在奏時嚴「格」亦無用矣。操絃時當以兩膝緊附琴軸，身微傴僂，臂須着力，稍微震顫，於聲調之高低曲折處，儘可得心應手，無庸顧慮，蓋不似棧絃之易於中斷也。在夜闌人靜時，試奏粤曲「漢宮秋月「走馬英雄」或「昭君怨」數折，則其聲　之鳴咽悱惻，凄凉岑寂，如聞一子夜烏啼」令人不忍卒聽；如奏平劇，則一無動聽者，誠以共發音過於　巧，似力不勝任，但奏以「柳搖金」等「過門」曲，則美奐絕倫，風趣別具，較之綫絃二胡，不可同日而語矣。</p>

<p>北平票界中兩位獃公子</p>
<p>北平爲六七百年的一座古城，王公府邸的大宅子很多，每一宅第有數百間房子的很不稀奇，可是這麽大的一所院子，倘使主人窮了下來，有時候連燒餅麻花錢都付不出，往往走過些大府邸的門首，常能瞧見賣麻花落花生等貨小販，對着宅子的大門嚷駡半天，裏邊都不會走出一個人來把天天積欠下來的幾元麻花錢付淸，這種情形，恐怕在上海是很少見的吧。滿淸亡後，許多世襲王公約後人，亳無生產的能力，現錢花完嘍，起先還可以拍賣些古董家具，再花光嘍，就只好招呼打小鼓的（北平專有收買舊物的一行，挑着扭子以打小鼓爲記。）賣破爛，一到這般光景，就離賣房子不遠了。因爲此類宅第的範圍廣人，倘使房主的上人，生前曾經藏埋些一金銀珠寳在某院某屋的地板下，或是夾壁牆內，嗣後遇着放了外任，得急病而死，再不然臨終時不　　藏寳的所在吿訴他的後人，那末，等到屋的新主人翻造房子時，往往就可獲到意外一筆大財，除去買房子付出的代價，恐怕還要餘川多少倍的外快呢。最著名的北平××醫院，據說就是得了這宗外財，所以才建造的那般富麗堂皇的。此外尙有幾處因爲知之不詳，故而不必縷舉了。現在我所欲談的兩位獃公子，我與他們都常常見面，並且這兩位的上人都是淸季的顯宦，有一處府邸我也時常走動過，覺得那所大宅院僅僅只賣上萬元，而且還閙出一段人所罕聞的奇事來，未免太爲可惜，所以特爲舉此二事以告讀者（一五一）</p>

<h3>New Guilin Chinese Army Deploys New Positions, Prepares to Surround Japanese Army; Japanese Army's Rear Supply Difficult, Chinese Army Secretly Restrains Them; Cantonese Chinese Army Attacks Xinhui and Nanhai, Destroys Many Japanese Barracks</h3>
<p>Chongqing: News that the Japanese army has occupied Nanning was officially acknowledged by the Chinese side for the first time today. This afternoon, a Chinese military spokesperson announced to reporters that Nanning fell on Sunday. Chinese and Japanese forces are currently in a stalemate in the mountains about 20 to 30 kilometers north and northeast of Nanning. The vanguard of the Japanese army crossed the Jiang River on November 23. The next day, the Japanese army arrived in the suburbs of Nanning. Fierce fighting lasted all day on the 25th. The next day, Nanning was occupied by the Japanese army. The Chinese army has withdrawn to positions north and northeast of Nanning. However, the Chinese army along the Nanning-Beihai highway continues to restrain the rear of the Japanese army. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to a Chinese military spokesperson today, the Chinese army in Guangxi is now infiltrating behind the Japanese army from all directions, attempting to encircle the Japanese in the Nanning area. The Japanese army's current incursion is a planned strategy by the Chinese side to create a converging encirclement. It was also stated that the Chinese army abandoned Nanning last Saturday. The Chinese army has now retreated to the mountains 30 kilometers outside Nanning. The spokesperson also said that the Japanese army may establish an air force base in Nanning to threaten the Chinese interior. (United Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to news here today, although the Chinese army has withdrawn from Nanning, it is still fiercely fighting the invading Japanese army near Nanning. Although the Japanese army has reached Nanning, it is extremely difficult to secure supplies for their rear, because the highway from Qinzhou to Nanning has been destroyed by the Chinese side. At the same time, due to the rugged terrain, the Japanese army's heavy artillery cannot enter. The Chinese side has now moved to new positions and is preparing for a major counterattack against the Japanese army. (United Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to news here today, although the war in South China has affected the Jiang River basin, the military authorities in Guilin are very optimistic about the future. They believe that the deeper the Japanese army penetrates, the more likely the Chinese army will be to recreate a major victory like the Battle of Changsha. The gains and losses of one place have little impact on the overall situation. The Japanese army has already suffered considerable losses on the way from the coast to Nanning, but future losses will be even greater, because the journey the Japanese army is taking is 100 kilometers long and narrow, with no Chinese workers or food. As for the Japanese claim that the invading army in Nanning has three divisions, in reality it only has one and a half divisions. The artillery they brought is mostly small and old. According to refugees from Qinzhou, only one Japanese division landed in Qinzhou, and one and a half brigades landed in Fangcheng. (United Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The war report from the front remains optimistic about the Nanning battle. One prediction is that the Chinese army will annihilate the Japanese army trapped on the banks of the Jiang River sooner or later. It is said that the Japanese army in Guizhou province is currently deployed in two locations: one on the north bank of the Jiang River, and the other between the south bank of the Jiang River and Beihai. A Japanese column is now venturing deep into Nanning from the western Guangdong coast. Their food supply is gradually running out. The position of the Japanese army on the north bank of the Jiang River is very vulnerable. The Chinese army is currently attacking it from the north, west, and east, while the Jiang River cuts off its retreat to the south. The Chinese war report also hints that the commander-in-chief of the Southwest Chinese Army will soon order a general counterattack against the Japanese army that has penetrated into Guizhou province. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Guilin: Three Japanese planes flew at low altitude over an area northeast of Yongcheng this morning for reconnaissance. (28th dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: After the Chinese army withdrew from Yongcheng, it is now firmly defending the mountainous areas north and northeast of the city. The Japanese army's offensive has been frustrated in recent days, and the war has stabilized. (28th dispatch)</p>
<p>Sihui: The Chinese army advancing towards Jiangmen and Xinhui destroyed many important bridges between Jiangmen and Xinhui on the 24th, cutting off Japanese communication lines and forcing them to approach the suburbs of Xinhui. After a brave assault, they broke into the city and burned more than 60 Japanese barracks and warehouses at Changwan Bridge and Siye Street. The fire lit up the sky. On the morning of the 26th, they took advantage of the momentum to attack the Japanese army at Mashan on the Xinhui-He Road. Fierce fighting lasted all day. The Japanese greatly reinforced, and the Chinese then transferred. In this battle, more than 400 Japanese were killed and a large number of war spoils were seized. (28th dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: The Chinese army attacked Xinhui again on the evening of the 26th, engaging in mixed combat with the Japanese in the suburbs all night. The Japanese retreated to the rear, and the Chinese army took advantage of the momentum to rush into the city, burning the Japanese headquarters and many puppet organizations. Bridges along the Jiangmen-Xinhui highway were completely destroyed. (28th dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: At midnight this morning, the Chinese army attacked Jiujiang City in Nanhai. The Japanese and puppets were caught off guard. Gunfire erupted for a time, and order was thrown into chaos. The Japanese and puppets fled in panic and many were stabbed. The barracks and warehouses were also set on fire by the Chinese and are still burning as of this evening. (28th dispatch)</p>
<p>Meixian: At dawn on the 25th, more than 800 Japanese soldiers, under the cover of machine guns and artillery, advanced towards Fengxi in two routes. One route, about 500 soldiers, arrived near Renzhong Village via Chihu and was intercepted by the Chinese army, resulting in fierce fighting. Another route, about 200 soldiers, advanced towards Xuhou Bridge and came into contact with the Chinese army near Dongxi Tomb. Another small group of Japanese soldiers attacked Liancheng. The Chinese army countered the attacks separately. Fierce fighting lasted until evening. Chinese surprise troops suddenly launched a flank attack near Renzhong Village. The entire Japanese line wavered and collapsed towards Chaozhou City. In this battle, more than 200 Japanese soldiers were killed. (28th dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Expectations for the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>The serious situation between the Soviet Union and Finland cannot be ignored as long as it remains unresolved; first, because the severity is difficult to limit, and second, because the scope of the severity is difficult to limit. If it can be resolved, it is a great fortune. If it cannot be resolved, it will inevitably worsen and become uncontrollable. If it cannot be controlled, there is a great possibility of involving third and fourth countries and creating a European war era situation. Playing with soldiers is like playing with fire. The result of expansion often exceeds expectations. When Japan launched its military aggression against China, it never expected that the war would continue for two and a half years without being able to stop. When Germany opened fire on Poland, it thought it could repel Britain and France with a peaceful offensive. It never expected that it would have to prepare to bet its life on the Western Front. As far as the Soviet-Finnish situation is concerned, the "facts" of the disputes reported by the two countries are very different, and it is unknown which is true. However, it is logically impossible to judge that Finland would take the initiative to cause disputes and provoke by firing. However, the Soviet Union not only used international propaganda to say that Finland provoked, as if to say that Finland should be responsible, but also used domestic propaganda that the border and security were actually oppressed by Finland, igniting a fiery flame for the use of force against Finland!</p>
<p>Given the far-reaching international ambitions of the Third International, we cannot imagine that the Soviet Union would be willing to personally engage in dangerous and foolish wars, unless it encountered unbearable provocation, unless sacrificing two or three thousand people could gain 200,000 miles of land! Therefore, we also cannot imagine that the Soviet Union is willing to fight a real war against Finland this time. Events sometimes exceed expectations. The Soviet Union is not as calm as it used to be, and has launched its official newspapers and open-air rallies. These are the main weapons before using real force, making the Soviet people feel that it is unbearable and making the Soviet people express the "grand wish to liberate the Finnish people from the high pressure of capitalism." Although Finland has stated that it accepts the Soviet Union's request to withdraw its troops 25 kilometers from the border, it also reciprocally requests the Soviet Union's border guards to withdraw as well. Resolving difficulties with reciprocal conditions seems to be fair, and disputes should hopefully be resolved. What is not optimistic is that the Soviet Union's recent international rhetoric does not contain the word "reciprocal," so Finland's response may be considered unsolvable by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>If the Soviet Union truly "cannot bear it" and uses force against Finland, and if the Finnish people, without waiting for the so-called encouragement from Britain and the United States, can know how to defend themselves and fight against the war, then the strong bullying the weak and the many oppressing the few, victory will certainly belong to the Soviet Union. The certainty of victory is an important argument for not asserting that the Soviet Union will not personally engage in war, although we earnestly hope that the Soviet Union will seriously consider it. If the war is won in one fell swoop, the matter is extremely simple, but Finland is a free barrier, and the timing and location may cause the Soviet Union to encounter considerable difficulties. Moreover, the use of force, and even after victory, will directly and indirectly induce various inevitable consequences in the international arena. As it stands: the war between Britain, France, and Germany is one link in the international problem, and the Soviet-Finnish dispute is another link. Although each link has its own center of gravity and its own possibility of individual resolution, the result of deterioration and expansion will turn Europe into a great furnace and merge into one. The Soviet Union will then become a member of it, no longer able to transcend the environment and have a significant influence. The Soviet Union's possible achievements in Finland may be even greater than its achievements in Poland. The Soviet Union's meaning for Finland may be regarded as no different from that for Poland, but the impression it gives to the international community, that is, the evaluation made by the international community, is completely different. Even if the Soviet Union disregards international impressions and evaluations, the reaction to the attitudes of various countries towards the Soviet Union in the future will inevitably make the Soviet Union feel new obstacles. From the past few years to the present, under the various international dynamics, countries compared with each other, all those who participate in hegemony have either proved their failure, or exposed their decline, or are in the middle of a desperate fight, and the victory or defeat and survival is unknown. Only the United States in the Americas is a success story, and the Soviet Union in Europe is a winner. Japan and Germany believe in violence to fight for hegemony, but they have doomed themselves to a tragic fate. Even if it is said that Japan and Germany cannot be said to have failed now, at least they are already trapped in deep waters! It is necessary to know that a gentle embrace and a ferocious face are definitely not different paths leading to the same goal, and they are definitely not each with their own merits. At the same time, it is also necessary to know that survival and freedom are the inevitable desires of mankind, and small and weak nations are definitely not lowly animals. Therefore, for all of these reasons, we are planning for the Soviet Union, rather than changing its style, following Germany, and not hesitating to jump into the oil pot and attempt to invade Finland. It is better to preserve sincerity, develop the truth, and strive to practice the slogans of assisting small and weak nations over the years, and to take the expansion of justice and the restoration of peace as its own responsibility!</p>
<h3>Difficult to Renew US-Japan Trade Treaty Due to Japanese Troops Not Withdrawing from China; Just Voice of the American Public; Anti-Japanese Association to Conduct Nationwide Publicity; Urging the Government to Ban Military Supplies to Japan</h3>
<p>New York: The New York "Daily News" editorialized yesterday, "The US government's cancellation of the 1911 US-Japan trade treaty has given the United States a more advantageous position in negotiations on the Far East issue. Now is the time to tell Japan that the price of renewing the US-Japan trade treaty is that they must withdraw troops from China. We must use this opportunity to make Japan submit." The New York "Daily News" is the largest-selling newspaper in the United States. This editorial can represent a change in American public opinion. A year ago, the newspaper wrote to urge the government to adopt a laissez-faire policy towards the Far East. (United Press, 28th)</p>
<p>New York: The American "Anti-Japanese Aggression" Committee announced yesterday that they will hold a nationwide publicity campaign to urge the government to issue an order banning the sale of military materials and other materials to Japan. The chairman of this committee is former Secretary of State Stimson. The list of new sponsors includes Admiral Yarnell, former commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, and Harley Lyman, former chairman of the US Chamber of Commerce. This committee will enthusiastically support Senator Hudeman's proposal to stop trade with Japan, which will be submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. (United Press, 28th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Groups Send Telegrams to Borah Calling for Justice; Japanese Militarists Use American Military Supplies to Invade China and Slaughter Civilians</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to a United Press report, Senator Borah, a leader of the American isolationist faction, said that US-Japan trade is gradually increasing, and we should not hastily abolish the trade treaty without reason. Yesterday, various civic groups in this city jointly sent a telegram to Borah, calling for justice and peace. The original telegram is recorded below: "Senator Borah of the Washington Senate, we have carefully listened to your speech, in which you said that US-Japan trade is gradually increasing and should not be stopped hastily without reason. We dare to solemnly tell you, based on humanitarianism, that the atrocities of the Japanese militarists in China and their slaughter of our people are excellent reasons for the United States to stop trading with Japan. If you study the development of US-Japan trade, you will know that this kind of trade is almost entirely built on military raw materials, which is the tool that Japan uses to invade China. This commercial interest comes from the blood of millions of Chinese people, including men, women, and children. We dare to ask you to use the power of justice and humanity to stop it. The China National Diplomacy Association, the National Women's Association, the General Association of Frontline Anti-Japanese Soldiers, the China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression League, the Chongqing New Life Movement Promotion Association, the Chinese Seamen's Union, and the Friends of the Wounded Soldiers Association, respectfully kowtow."

<h3>Dr. Brown Criticizes Borah</h3>
<p>Chongqing: US Senator Borah recently made a speech advocating that US-Japan commercial relations should be considered. Dr. Brown, chairman of the China Church Hospital United Committee, opposed Borah's position. His original text is as follows: "Senator Borah and the isolationists hope to preserve American commercial interests. The 500 colleagues of the American church hospitals in China were surprised and saddened to hear this. Our colleagues serve the wounded and sick people in China and deeply understand their suffering, either poisoned by the indiscriminate bombing of Japanese aircraft or killed by the atrocities of enemy troops. However, Senator Borah and his colleagues advocate maintaining the trade that is mainly based on military supplies. It must be known that the suffering and abuse suffered by the Chinese people all come from the hands of countries that buy American goods. If the United States continues to maintain commerce, it is tantamount to acquiescing to this inexcusable atrocity. What China is encountering today is like the American War of Independence. This winter is a critical time to turn defeat into victory. The Chinese people are fighting for the freedom and independence of their motherland. Can we, the American people, be driven by greed and used by others, and be willing to help harm the Chinese people? According to Dr. Brown, who recently went to the front and rear of fifteen provinces to inspect the relief work, which lasted for a year, the relief work in China is attended by people from all countries. Their work is extremely difficult, and their responsibilities are extraordinarily important. Service personnel often feel inadequate, medical supplies are very lacking, and hospitals are too small. Patients often exceed capacity by two or three times. When performing surgery, assistants are not trained. In addition, Japanese planes constantly bombed indiscriminately, and hospitals were often damaged. Whenever there was an air raid, patients had to be moved into air-raid shelters several times a day. If the hospital was destroyed, the medical equipment had to be dug out of the rubble and a new location had to be found. Of the hundreds of thousands of refugees who were spared the disaster of the epidemic, the relief workers made great contributions. They endured many hardships, but none left their posts. They all have the ideals of the founding of the United States, fighting for freedom and equality. Will the American people help the relief workers in China, or will they abandon them in favor of money that is ill-gotten? This still remains to be decided by the people of the country."

<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Churches in Sichuan and the US</h3>
<p>Peiping: It was learned here today that the American Christian United Church in Xiushan County, Sichuan Province, was bombed by Japanese planes on November 10. Although several large American flags were planted on the roof of the church, the Japanese planes turned a blind eye and still dropped two bombs. A foreigner's residence was destroyed. Fortunately, the American church staff escaped in advance, so there were no casualties. According to news received by the church here, Japanese planes dropped a total of 20 explosive bombs and incendiary bombs on Xiushan. Many civilian houses near the American church were burned down, and the Chinese who died were saving people. (United Press, 28th)</p>
<h3>Dr. Bethune Dies of Illness</h3>
<p>Chongqing – According to the Xinhua Daily, the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, this morning, Dr. Bethune, a Canadian physician in the Chinese Communist Party army, died of blood poisoning on November 13th after contracting an infection while treating wounded soldiers near the front lines in the Jin-Cha-Sui border region. The newspaper only mentioned Dr. Bethune's Chinese name "Bo Quan (transliteration)." No one among the Chinese Communist Party members here knew Dr. Bethune's English name. The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued a condolence telegram today, expressing admiration for Dr. Bethune's work over the past two years. According to people in the Canadian Church here speaking to the Reuters reporter today, there were two Canadian physicians in the Chinese Communist Party army, one being Dr. Bethune from the Canadian Church in Henan Province, and the other being Dr. Bethune. However, Dr. White returned to his country some time ago, so it is believed that the deceased must be Dr. Bethune. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>British and French Governments Announce Measures to Block German Export Trade – To Be Implemented Simultaneously Starting Next Month, April – Retaliation Against Unlawful and Inhumane Warfare Tactics – Legitimate Interests of Neutral Countries Will Still Be Protected</h3>
<p>London – Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons this afternoon that measures to block German export trade will be implemented starting next month, April 4th. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London – Regarding the matter of blocking German export trade, the order signed by King George VI yesterday will be promulgated at 5:30 PM today, at which time the Ministry of Economic Warfare will also issue a statement explaining it and formally notify the envoys of various neutral countries, declaring that Britain has made every effort to take into account the interests of those countries. These blockade measures are completely identical to the plan formulated by the French government and are scheduled to be implemented simultaneously on April 4th next month. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London – The government issued a notice to the business community this morning, stating that the Allied governments have decided to block enemy export trade. All ships sailing from Germany and ships sailing from various countries to Germany will be subject to the same control as ships entering. Shipping companies should instruct ships to dock at bases under British or French control. Ships sailing from ports in the Mediterranean or Black Sea should dock at Malta, Haifa, Port Said, or Gibraltar, or at Marseille or Oran in France. Those who do not comply will be escorted elsewhere for inspection. Any enemy products or enemy goods that must be unloaded at British ports will be kept in the custody of the President of the Prize Court. If the goods are clearly identified as enemy property, the court may order them to be transferred to the British King for use or sold. The proceeds will be kept by the court. The proceeds and unsold goods will be disposed of by the court when peace is declared. The proceeds should be paid out, or the detained goods should be released at any time, or the court may decide, subject to the following conditions: (1) Proof that the goods became the property of a neutral country before November 27, 1939; (2) Approval from an official appointed by the British King, subject to the following conditions: (1) Goods carried on ships that left the last neutral port before December 11, 1939; (2) The order was placed before November 27, 1939, and according to the terms of the order, the buyer must take delivery before shipment, and the buyer has paid for the goods before shipment. The ship carrying the goods left the last neutral port before January 1, 1940. Merchants who wish to ensure that goods shipped from European countries are not delayed or detained should obtain a certificate of origin from the British or French consular officials stationed in the relevant European countries. This certificate should accompany the goods loaded on the ship, which will greatly facilitate inspection of the ship at the control base. Therefore, shipping companies must not accept goods loaded without this certificate. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Paris – The government promulgated an order today to block German export trade, mainly stipulating that all kinds of goods loaded in enemy ports and shipped after December 4th of this year may be intercepted by the French competent authorities and ordered to be unloaded in the ports of the British and French Allies. In accordance with the general principles of international law and current regulations, these goods and ships will be detained or captured. Other places occupied or controlled by the enemy should be regarded as enemy territory, and all goods belonging to these places should also be regarded as enemy property. In addition, the French government issued a statement elaborating on this order, stating that France is forced to wage war against Germany to defend the fundamental right of all nations to live and thrive in a free and peaceful environment. The German government has disregarded the guarantees it has repeatedly provided, violated international law and humanitarian principles, and blatantly implemented various acts of violence. To name a few prominent examples, it has violated the 1936 Protocol on Submarine Warfare, abused torpedoes to sink merchant ships of both France and neutral countries, and violated the 1907 Hague International Convention by laying mines indiscriminately without prior notice, destroying many merchant ships, causing many non-combatants, including British and French, and innocent women and children to be killed or injured. This proves that Germany is determined to use illegal and inhumane means to prevent Britain and France from trading with other countries by sea. France is compelled to do so and has full right to take retaliatory measures to prevent all German goods from being transported abroad, but is willing to preserve the legitimate interests of neutral countries. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Paris – The government will promulgate the measures to block German export trade by order tomorrow, and explain that the British and French retaliatory measures are due to Germany's use of illegal and inhumane warfare methods. The British government will issue the same order a few hours later, and the British and French envoys stationed abroad will notify the exporters of the countries where they are stationed of these measures, and inform them that they will be implemented a few days later to allow exporters to take the necessary measures to adapt to these measures. After its implementation in the future, the inspection of German export goods will be handled by the existing inspection committee (used to inspect German imports). Regarding this matter, Blockade Minister Zhaerno recently gave a speech to reporters from various countries, stating that Germany, on the pretext that the blockade policy implemented by Britain and France is aimed at its people, disregards the Hague International Convention signed by the country and conducts illegal and inhumane naval warfare, sinking ships of various countries indiscriminately and forcing innocent passengers, innocent women and children of various countries to be tragically drowned. Under these circumstances, the British and French governments have the right to take various new measures to block their export trade, thereby cutting off their foreign exchange income, but at the same time, they must do their best to protect the rights of various neutral countries, and pay serious attention to their legitimate interests. Regarding the inspection of German export goods, Britain and France have decided to handle it by the existing inspection committee. All kinds of goods that prove to be clearly belonging to various neutral countries and have nothing to do with Germany should still be allowed to circulate as usual. After the German export trade is blocked, the markets that the country previously gained through dumping can now be recovered by various neutral countries and Britain and France. However, since British and French industries must focus on the manufacture of military supplies during the war, the development of this new market is a good opportunity for various neutral countries to develop export trade. We must finally declare one point, that is, the measures decided by the British and French governments this time are the same as those implemented during the previous European War, that is, from 1995 to 1917. If various neutral countries suffer some inconvenience as a result, they should also be aware that Britain and France are making significant sacrifices to protect the world, and temporarily endure it, which is the minimum contribution to this mission.

<h3>German Mine Warfare – Britain Still Has Confidence – Current Impact Is Limited – Countermeasures Can Take Effect</h3>
<p>London – Some people may have alarming views on German mine warfare, but this is not the case here, for several reasons: (1) Magnetic mines are not new, they were already used in the previous Great War, and countermeasures do exist. The British Navy is currently improving countermeasures at an abnormal rate. (2) The western ports of Britain and France are completely unaffected by mines. (3) Even if the eastern ports of Britain are affected, it is limited. For example, since the indiscriminate mine warfare began, there has been no closure or prohibition of shipping in the eastern ports. Even during the period of the greatest loss of ships, a large number of shipping convoys still sailed through the mine area and arrived at their destinations safely. (4) The Danish Ministry of Commerce announced the existence of a "sea lane" through which ships from Scandinavian countries can sail from Skagerrak to the British coast, showing that Denmark still intends to maintain exports to Britain as before. (5) According to observers, the use of new methods of warfare that violate international law, although they may achieve initial success, are only temporary, and methods to counter these new weapons are quickly discovered. History shows that the use of illegal means is ultimately self-defeating. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>New York – The New York Post today published an essay by naval expert Ielsburg, stating that Germany's mine warfare may indicate that its submarine warfare has failed. Germany must sink 20,000 to 30,000 tons of ships every day for several months in order to win the naval war, but Germany is far from the above record, whether using mines or torpedoes.

The content was quite strong. At that time, the British Foreign Minister replied to Ambassador Shigemitsu, "The British government has to stop German export trade, but it will give the best consideration to the impact on Japan." The British Foreign Minister will also give a formal reply within days. (Domei dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Paris – Japanese Chargé d'affaires Miyazaki visited the Director of the Far East Department of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 17th and protested against the French government's joint decision with the British government to implement the method of detaining German export goods, saying that this method infringes on Japan's commercial rights and requesting consideration of protecting neutral countries' trade issues. (Domei dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Today's Kokumin Shimbun published an editorial urging Britain to completely blockade the German ports of Bremen and Hamburg without detaining German exports carried on neutral ships, because large quantities of goods cannot be transported to Japan via the Siberian Railway, and detaining German exports at sea will have a significant impact on Japan. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen – The Danish Ministry of Commerce issued a decree today temporarily prohibiting the export of certain goods. This measure is necessary to deal with the British blockade measures. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen – There was originally a daily ship between here and the island of "Bornholm" in the Baltic Sea (belonging to Denmark), but it has now been suspended due to the danger of navigation caused by the laying of mines by Germany in the Baltic Sea. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – It is reported that a total of 38 Swedish ships have been detained in German ports, 15 ships have been detained in British ports, and 1 ship has been detained in French ports, totaling 1,140,900 tons. Some of them have been detained for up to a month. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin – "German General Report" columnist Cerix published an article today entitled "Protests Are Useless," claiming that in the past week, Italy, Japan, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium have successively lodged protests with the British Foreign Office against the blockade measures. Other countries such as Norway have also expressed their opposition to Britain in newspapers. The result has created a tense situation between Britain and various neutral countries. Germany should do its best to resist Britain's blockade measures. At the same time, it solemnly announces to various neutral countries that they must adhere to true neutrality, otherwise it will not be a safe path for the neutral countries themselves.

<h3>British Parliament Reconvenes – Simple Ceremony – King Reads Address</h3>
<p>London – Parliament reconvened today. Members of both the House of Lords and the House of Commons held a joint meeting in the House of Lords in the morning, presided over by King George VI himself. However, due to the war, the ceremony was relatively simple. According to custom, the King and Queen should have arrived in a four-horse carriage, but this time they only arrived in an ordinary sedan car. They entered hand in hand and approached the throne. At that time, the King's brother, the Duke of Gloucester, and the Duke of Kent were already standing by their side. The House of Lords was also fully present. All members of the House of Commons were then summoned to the House. The Lord Chancellor knelt and presented the address, which was read by the King, stating, "This war requires the collective efforts of all subjects of the country. We are very pleased that the various autonomous territories can fully cooperate and make various contributions. Our fleet is leading merchant fleets and armed fishing fleets around the world to maintain freedom of navigation. The land and air forces are also fulfilling their defense responsibilities on the French front and at home and abroad, and will be able to cope with it. Even if there are sacrifices, we will not hesitate. Members of both houses, your responsibilities are also very arduous. You will be able to express the determination of our nation. The government will ask the members of the House of Commons to pass a finance bill to raise military expenses. In short, the bills to be proposed by the government are for the welfare of all subjects of the country, and are really necessary. May God bless you." (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>British War Expenditure – £6 Million Per Day – Australia Actively Trains Pilots – Greatest Determination to Cooperate with Britain</h3>
<p>London – At the end of last week, Ottawa broadcast an official statement, stating Australia and Canada's determination to provide the greatest cooperation with Britain's war effort. It is said that Australia's expenses will reach £50 million in the first year of the war, almost four times the expenses in the first year of the last war, and the number of people being trained is also twice as high as before. 20,000 aircraft pilots are now fully trained in Australia. In addition, there are thousands of Australian air combatants being trained in Canada. It is estimated that Canada's economy for the first year of the war is £63 million. Since the start of the war, goods have been ordered, including Canadian supplies and defense equipment worth £5 million, supplies from the UK worth £1 million, and aircraft from the US worth £2 million. Currently, Britain spends £6 million per day on the war. Although this number is higher than the daily expenditure in the later stages of the last war, it accounts for a smaller proportion of the national income. Queensland government statistician Clark, known for compiling national income, estimated that in 1918, 60% of the UK's national income was used for war purposes, but today it may not exceed 40%. The output of British industry is currently half as much as in 1918, which shows that a war expenditure of £6 million per day is not the greatest effort that Britain can afford economically, but Germany "has indeed exhausted all its economic preparations and cannot make greater efforts."

<h3>US Should Strive to Avoid Being Involved in War – Hoover Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Golffax, California – Former US Republican President Hoover recently delivered a speech here, stating that if the United States is drawn into the vortex of the European war, our freedom will be lost, and a dictatorship will inevitably appear in the United States in fact.

Today, the American people urgently need to use their reason and must not be drawn into the vortex of the Second European War again due to temporary emotional impulses. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>German-Danish Trade Adjustment – Negotiations Proceed Smoothly</h3>
<p>Copenhagen – German-Danish trade negotiations are expected to conclude today, and a joint declaration will be issued, outlining the course of the negotiations. British newspapers have been spreading rumors in recent days, attempting to undermine the German-Danish negotiations. For example, the "Daily Telegraph" reported on the 25th that Germany was using torpedoes to pressure Denmark, Sweden, and other countries, but the Danish authorities responsible immediately issued a denial, proving that the British newspaper's report was inaccurate. Britain and Denmark have repeatedly decided to hold trade negotiations, but no agreement has been reached on the price of Danish agricultural products. Since the German-Danish trade negotiations began, there have been no frictions, and they are about to end at the same time. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>

Germany immediately replied that the German government was prepared to accept all charitable proposals regarding this matter. The Red Cross also made the same inquiry to the British and French governments at the same time, but Germany does not know what the British and French replies were. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>Naval Department Announces: Details of German Ship Sinking British Ship. Outnumbered and Hit in North Atlantic. Ship Caught Fire and Sank After Three Hours of Fighting.</h3>
<p>London - The Naval Department announced today the details of the merchant ship "Rawalpindi" (16,697 tons) being sunk by the German pocket battleship "Deutschland." This merchant ship, converted into a cruiser, was responsible for patrolling the northern region, inspecting contraband, and preventing German trade. On the 23rd of this month, at 3:30 PM, while patrolling southeast of Iceland, it spotted an enemy ship. Captain Kennedy, using binoculars, identified it as the German ship "Deutschland." He immediately ordered preparations for battle and changed course to position the enemy ship on the starboard side, while also releasing a smokescreen for cover. Unexpectedly, another enemy ship appeared on the starboard side. The "Deutschland" was also speeding towards them. Orders were given to stop the ship, but they were ignored, and it continued forward. A cannonball then passed over the bow. The "Deutschland," seeing the warning ineffective, fired its 11-inch guns simultaneously, launching the first attack. This was at 3:45 PM, at a distance of 10,000 yards. The "Rawalpindi" returned fire with its four 6-inch guns on the starboard side. The enemy ship continued to fire, and its third shell destroyed the British ship's lights and the electrical winch for supplying ammunition. The fourth shell completely destroyed the bridge and the radio room. By this time, both enemy ships had approached, and the second enemy ship circled to the rear of the British ship, firing from the port side. The "Rawalpindi" was attacked from both sides. After all the guns were destroyed and the entire ship was ablaze, after a cruiser converted from a merchant ship fought two heavily equipped formal enemy ships for three to forty minutes, the enemy ships ceased firing. At this time, the British ship lowered three lifeboats. One of them was already leaking. The other two carried more than thirty people, who were likely captured by the enemy ships. Eleven crew members jumped into the sea and swam to the leaking lifeboat, escaping capture by the German ships. Around 6:15, they saw a British ship approaching and immediately fled. It was already dark and raining heavily, and the British cruiser could not pursue. The eleven crew members adrift at sea were later rescued by the British company steamer "Chitral." The remaining crew members sank with the ship, flying the national flag. By 8:00 PM, the raging fire on the ship was no longer visible. (20th Reuters)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German High Command announced that Britain, to avoid its fleet being attacked by German submarines and air forces in the North Sea and North Atlantic, deemed it necessary to withdraw British warships from that area. The result of the British-German naval battle near Iceland exposed Britain's weakness. When the British auxiliary cruiser "Rawalpindi" opened fire with the German fleet, the sky was dark, but the German warships were still able to hit their targets. Before long, the "Rawalpindi's" ammunition hold exploded, and the ship sank. The sailors rescued by the Germans were all Scotsmen. (28th Haitong)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German High Command announced today that several German warships, under the command of Naval Undersecretary Marshall, patrolled the North Atlantic, scouting between Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Near Greenland, they encountered the British ship "Rawalpindi." After an exchange of fire, the "Rawalpindi" sank. The German fleet immediately tried to rescue survivors, but only twenty-six people were rescued. (28th Haitong)</p>

<h3>Finland Responds to Soviet Union, Advocates Joint Withdrawal of Troops, Soviet Attitude is Firm</h3>
<p>Helsinki - Regarding the border dispute between Finland and the Soviet Union, after the Soviet Union demanded that Finnish troops withdraw 25 kilometers from the border, the Finnish government submitted a reply tonight, stating that it was willing to comply, but on the condition that Soviet troops also withdraw the same distance from the border. It stated that Finland's consistent position, as expressed in talks with the Soviet Union, need not be repeated. Regarding the incident that occurred at 3:45 PM yesterday, Finnish border guards did not open fire. In fact, the artillery fire came from Menila, which is located within Soviet territory. The point of impact was approximately 800 meters from the border and was clearly visible from the Finnish side, indicating that Finland did not initiate a provocative action. However, to avoid further complications, it is still willing to accept the Soviet Union's request, but on the condition that Soviet troops also withdraw 25 kilometers. (27th Havas)</p>
<p>Helsinki - When the border dispute between Finland and the Soviet Union occurred on the 26th of this month, General Mannerheim, Chief of Staff of the Finnish Army, was inspecting the border area and has now returned here. According to him, the farthest range of the field guns stationed in the border area is 20 kilometers from the border. The heavy artillery positions are at least 50 kilometers from the border, indicating that Finnish shells could not have fallen within Soviet territory. Furthermore, the 16th of this month was a Sunday. On that afternoon, Finnish border guard officers and soldiers were participating in religious ceremonies, so how could they have shelled the Soviet Union? (28th Havas)</p>
<p>Moscow - General Baochukov, commander of the Leningrad Military District, issued a notice to the troops stationed in the area: "Finnish troops have provoked our border guards in the Menila area of the Karelian Isthmus by opening fire. I hereby order the troops to immediately return fire if Finnish troops repeat such provocative acts, until the aggressors are completely annihilated." (28th Havas)</p>
<p>Moscow - The recent provocative actions of Finnish troops on the Soviet-Finnish border have aroused extreme indignation among the Soviet people. After the news of the Red Army being shelled by the Finns for no reason was broadcast on the radio last night, workers at factories and railways immediately held meetings. Today, meetings are being held across the country. At the meetings, workers, employees, intellectuals, and Red Army soldiers expressed speeches, all supporting the Soviet government and demanding that Finnish troops withdraw from the border near Leningrad, and declaring with great indignation that the Soviet people would not tolerate any new provocations and would protect the safety of Leningrad and the border. The Red Star newspaper also published a joint letter from several Red Army soldiers: "We will bravely defend the motherland. Those who challenge us viciously kill our comrades-in-arms. We will retaliate tenfold. If the Finnish rulers want to test the armament and the power of the officers and soldiers of the Soviet Red Army, they are welcome to try, but they will regret it later. Our answer to the challengers is only ruthless annihilation." (27th TASS)</p>
<p>New York - The Soviet Union's demands on Finland have been severely criticized by the New York Times, which stated that the Soviet Union's attitude is the same as Germany's, and the significance of the Soviet Union's policy of aggression is even greater than that of Germany. If the Soviet Union follows in the footsteps of the National Socialist Party and achieves its goals, other countries will inevitably follow suit. "This is a key moment in the current war, because if small countries cannot survive, the world will become a brutal world, and even the major powers will continue to compete endlessly."

<h3>US Fiscal Budget Falls Short This Year, Public Debt Issued to Make Up For It</h3>
<p>Washington - Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced that due to a budget deficit of $1.6 billion to date, the government plans to issue $500 million in treasury bills from December 8th to inject funds, with an interest rate of 2% and repayment in installments over nine to eleven years. According to political figures here, after the issuance of these treasury bills, the total amount of domestic public debt will reach $42 billion, and the maximum limit set by both houses of Congress is $45 billion, which is not much different. This is a major problem facing the current government, because it is not appropriate for the government to ask both houses of Congress to raise this limit before next year's general election. For the government's sake, it must reduce expenditures, increase taxes, or take other appropriate measures to balance the budget so that the budget deficit for this year does not exceed $3 billion. Then, the maximum limit of domestic public debt will not be broken. (27th Havas)</p>
<h3>All India Congress Passes Resolution Rejecting Cooperation With Britain, Seeking to Implement Independence Proposals</h3>
<p>Amsterdam - According to reliable news from India, the All India Congress passed a resolution to avoid being drawn into the war and refused to cooperate with the British authorities in India unless Britain changed its attitude towards India and accepted India's demands. Regarding the issue of Indian independence, the All India Congress' resolution believes that the establishment of an Indian constitutional assembly followed by the establishment of an Indian executive council is the only way to stop Britain's imperialist policies. At the same time, it can allow the All India Congress and Britain to consider future British-Indian cooperation issues. (28th Haitong)</p>

<h3>Principal Culprit in the Nakajima Assassination Case Arrested</h3>
<p>Tokyo - On October 4th, Nakajima Chikuhei, president of the Seiyukai Innovation Group, was attacked on the way home by car. The perpetrator fled. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department made great efforts to search for the perpetrator. In mid-November, a strong suspect was arrested in some way and seriously interrogated. As a result, on the 28th, it was found that Watanabe Michiharu, a martial artist living in Setagaya Ward, Tokyo, was the real perpetrator, and Miura Yoshiichi, president of the Kokka-sha, was a co-offender. The authorities immediately sent personnel to arrest them. The handgun used by the two was supplied by Kobiwara Ritoshi, a ronin who was arrested in Fukuoka on the 11th of this month. The motive for the assassination was to intimidate Nakajima into providing funds for "ultra-right-wing movement." (28th Allied Press)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army's Attempt to Invade Nanning, Wishful Thinking to Use Nanning as a Base for Invading Yunnan and Guizhou</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence - Since the Japanese launched the so-called new offensive in South China with both political and military motives, the situation in Guangdong Province has become increasingly tense. At the end of last month, twenty or thirty Japanese warships continuously patrolled the sea off the Leizhou Peninsula. On the 29th, six Japanese warships once bombarded Yangjiang and sent troops to land, but they were repelled by the Chinese army. On the 10th, Japanese warships again bombarded Yangjiang and landed at the same location, but they were again unsuccessful. On the 31st, Japanese warships turned to Daobai for harassment, and in the direction of Qinzhou, Lianzhou, and Fangcheng, Japanese warships also moved at the same time and sent aircraft to bomb extensively. However, the results were not officially landed. These actions are probably to test the strength of the Chinese garrison. Since then, the Japanese warships in Yangjiang and Daobai have gradually retreated, while the Japanese warships and aircraft have gathered in Zhuozhou Island (outside Beihai Port). Japanese warships have been patrolling the sea near Beihai, and Japanese aircraft have been taking off several times a day to bomb Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. On the 4th of this month, Japanese aircraft divided into four groups and attacked Guangdong and Guizhou provinces for reconnaissance and bombing. At 8:00 AM, the first group of nine aircraft attacked Yangjiang, dropped nine bombs on the county seat, and then flew away. The third group of one aircraft flew over Hepu and invaded Guizhou Province to reconnoiter Guixian, Xiangxian, Rongxian, Yulin, and Bobai. The third group of thirteen aircraft flew straight from Haikou to Xuwen at 11:00 AM and divided into two teams. One team of six aircraft peeped at Lianjiang and Hepu, and one team of seventeen aircraft invaded Guangxi and bombed Liuzhou extensively, dropping dozens of bombs. The fourth group of two aircraft reconnoitered in the airspace of Beihai. On the 5th, Japanese aircraft again divided into three groups and invaded the interior of Guangdong and Guangxi. The first group of ten aircraft dropped more than ten bombs in Duoan. The second group of seven aircraft dropped bombs in Aikou and Mosha. The third group of four aircraft took off from Qisha Seaport and dropped three bombs in Maoling Market, Qinxian County. On the 6th, Japanese aircraft became more active. From morning to dusk, southern Guangdong and southwestern Guangxi were threatened by Japanese aircraft all day long. Japanese aircraft harassed Qinxian, Nanning, Wuming, Deguo, Longan, Longmen, Lingshan, Guixian, Fangcheng, Xuwen, Lianjiang, Guiping, Wu, Liuzhou, Yongfu, and Guilin. Longan and Guilin were the main bombing targets. Dozens of bombs were dropped in Longan City, including many incendiary bombs, causing a major fire that destroyed dozens of houses. Forty bombs were dropped in Guilin, but because it was outside the city, there was no significant loss. On the 7th, 8th, 9th and 3rd, Japanese aircraft dropped bombs and fired shots at Qisha, Wulei, Longmen, Fangcheng, Aikou, Nanguan, Ningming, San Niang Bay, Rhinoceros Foot, Shakou, Nanning, and Duoan all day long, with Aikou being the most severely affected. On the 10th, the range of Japanese aircraft activity was even greater, and the targets were all in Guizhou Province. Jisi, Ningming, Pingxiang, Naqin, Mingjiang, Yongchun, Binyang, Qianjiang, Duoan, and Wuming counties were reconnoitered or bombed. On the 11th, the targets were concentrated on the coast of southern Guangdong. The two places of Daobai and Maoming suffered indiscriminate bombing. On the 13th and 14th, the activities of Japanese aircraft seemed to slow down again. On the morning of the 15th, the war broke out in Qinzhou Bay.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Japanese army's invasion of southern Guangdong this time is obviously to invade Guangxi. The mountains and ridges overlap in southern Guangdong, protruding overseas, and the land is poor and the people are poor. There is no military necessity or economic value. Moreover, the transportation in southern Guangdong is difficult, and all highways have been thoroughly destroyed. It is very difficult for the Japanese army to invade, but in Guizhou Province, Nanning is closer to southern Guangdong. The Japanese army plans to occupy this place, probably to use it as a stronghold and send aircraft to spy on western Hunan and Yunnan, and disrupt the Southwest base of the Chinese military. Therefore, the Japanese army's invasion of southern Guangdong this time at the risk cannot be regarded as a feint attack or harassment. It can be seen from the fact that the Japanese army landed not in Beihai but in Longmen that one of its intentions is to use it as a base. Beihai is the only large port in Guangdong. Since Guangzhou and Shantou successively fell, it has become the only transportation hub for foreign trade in South China. Its economic position is extremely important. However, Beihai is located on the coast, and the ground protrudes, which is conducive to the Japanese's encirclement. In addition, Zhuozhou Island, which faces Beihai across the sea, has long been occupied by the Japanese army. Since the door has been opened, it should be as easy as turning one's hand for the Japanese army to occupy this place. However, the Japanese army did not land in Beihai to attack Beihai, but in Longmen, east of Qisha, northwest of Beihai. Longmen is a very unknown coastal small place, but it is very close to Qinxian County and has a highway directly to Nanning, which is one of the central points on the transportation artery between Beihai and Nanning. Therefore, the Japanese army's occupation of this place is obviously intended to attack Nanning directly. However, Guizhou's anti-Japanese strength is very strong. The transportation in southern Guangdong is blocked, which is not suitable for the activities of the Japanese army's mechanized units. Moreover, the mountains and ridges overlap, which is easy to ambush. Moreover, the Japanese army's decision to attack Longmen this time is only based on the navy as the main force. The army is not only very small, but also mostly Northeast puppet troops. If they want to drive straight in, there will definitely be huge sacrifices.</p>
<p>As of today (17th), the only war news from Hong Kong about Beihai is that, in addition to the fact that Longmen has indeed fallen, Beihai is still in the hands of a Chinese army. As for Qisha, the situation is unknown. I guess it may also have fallen, because Qisha is closer to Nanning than Beihai. From a military point of view, the Japanese army should step up the attack and occupation. (17th)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army in Huai, Si, and Shu Counties, Frustrated Coordinated Operations, the Chinese Army Closes in on Siyang City</h3>
<p>Five or six hundred Japanese troops with eight artillery pieces from the three counties of Huai, Si, and Shu in northern Jiangsu Province attacked the Chinese army's defense in Siyang from Qijia Ferry on the 7th. They were attacked by the × battalion of the ×× regiment of the Chinese army in Qianzhuangxu, killing several Japanese troops. On the 8th at noon, the Japanese troops rampaged in Wangji in separate ways, one towards Shuqiang and one towards Zhuangtan. The Japanese troops who attacked Zhuangtan were attacked by the × battalion of the Chinese army and fled in embarrassment across the water. The Japanese troops who attacked Shuqiang were attacked by the × battalion of the Chinese army and captured three rifles and several donkeys. After setting fire to civilian houses in Shuqiang, the Japanese army fled south in panic. On the morning of the 9th, they were intercepted by the × battalion of the Chinese army and killed more than 40 Japanese troops, captured four rifles and two war horses, and shot down many livestock vehicles. The Chinese army also suffered slight casualties. The Japanese army then continued to flee south. At Chenyikou, they were surrounded by the ×× unit of the Chinese army. After several hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army desperately broke through and fled across the water by dusk.</p>
<p>According to another report, the ×× brigade of the Chinese army in Siyang attacked Sicheng yesterday and had approached the city moat. Because the Japanese artillery fire was too fierce, they could not break in and retreated. The Aihucun, a pro-Japanese and puppet organization in Zhuangshixu, east of the city, was burned down by the Chinese army, and several traitors were captured. The Japanese army in Siyang City attacked Taowu on the morning of the 9th. The Chinese standing × brigade met the attack. After about half an hour of fighting, the Japanese army retreated. The Chinese army immediately pursued. The Japanese army relied on the fortifications of their stronghold and fiercely counterattacked with machine guns and artillery. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Chinese army killed several Japanese troops. The Japanese army could not hold on and collapsed and retreated.</p>
<h3>After Dinghai Fell, the Opium War's Giant Guns Were Dismantled and Taken Away by the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence - According to local news, during the Opium War in the 20th year of Daoguang, the British fleet attacked Guangzhou without success and changed to attack the Zhejiang Sea. At that time, the Qing court, according to Lin Zexu's presentation, advocated defending Zhejiang and built dozens of fortresses at various strategic locations in Dinghai County, Zhoushan Islands, Zhejiang, such as three miles west of the county seat and Donggangpu east of the city, to defend them and stationed heavy troops, which repeatedly played a significant role. Since the Republic of China, because there has been no foreign aggression, they have been in disrepair for many years and severely rusted. However, they are still a historical site. After the fall of Dinghai County, the Japanese army searched for scrap copper and iron everywhere. The Matsuo Unit of the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in the city sent more than one hundred engineers to dismantle the thirteen giant guns of the historical site "Dingyuan", etc., and transported them back to their country by warship one after another.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The first match of the Hong Kong Governor's Cup (note: the Governor's Cup adopts a best-of-three system), Association Chinese Union vs. General Association Western Union, was held on the 19th at the Navy Stadium in Causeway Bay. Before the start of the match, it was already packed, an unprecedented sight at the Navy Stadium. Two minutes before the start, the gates were locked. In the end, Chinese Union won a resounding victory of 5-3.</p>

<p>Middleton (Navy), Huo Ban (Navy), He Xi (Royal Scottish Regiment), Dagu Shannu (Joseph), Fula (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Chinese Union Advances Like a Bamboo Splitting</p>
<p>Three minutes into the match, Chinese Union adopted an offensive defense. Zheng Wenzhi unexpectedly broke through, dribbling around to the side of the goal. Xuan Di, seeing the danger, slid into a corner kick. Chengtao took the kick, landing five yards from the goal corner. Zou Wenzhi back-heeled the ball into the net, 1-0. At eight minutes, Feng Jingxiang advanced on the right wing. Li Huitang cleverly dodged Williamson and Shi Han, shooting fiercely into the net, 2-0. At twenty-two minutes, Western Union was still at a loss. Feng Jingxiang dribbled past Williamson, and Huitang shot diagonally, falling into the left corner of the goal from the crossbar, clear and beautiful, 3-0. At thirty minutes, the battle gradually became quieter. Fula threw in a ball from the sideline, Dagu Shannu passed it skillfully to He Xi, who swept it in with force, pulling back one goal, making it 1-3. With one minute left before the break, Xu Jingcheng passed to Chengtao, who advanced rapidly along the edge, entering the goal corner. Robinson tackled Chengtao, and the ball bounced to Zou Wenzhi, who gently pushed it, and the ball went into the net, 4-1, ending the first half.</p>
<p>Western Union's Counterattack Fails</p>
<p>After the restart, Huitang, Wenzhi, and Chengtao were all injured in the battle, and the Chinese Union's front line collapsed. Western Union seized the opportunity to counterattack fiercely. Zhang Rongcai made countless saves. At twenty minutes, Chinese Union was besieged even more urgently. Fula made a low pass from the right, and Dagu Shannu scored with a diagonal shot, making it 2-4. At thirty-five minutes, Fula shot from the crowd and scored again, making it 3-4, only one goal behind. Seeing the urgency of the situation, Chinese Union launched a large-scale counterattack. Feng Shentui intercepted Huo Ban's ball in the defense, dribbled and broke through the encirclement, passing it far to Chengtao, who sprinted with illness, passing it skillfully to the center. Shuiyi arrived in time, sweeping it into the net without waiting for the ball to stop. With only half a minute left until the end, the victory belonged to the national army with a score of 5-3.</p>

<h3>Increased Rent for Racecourse Football Field: Western Association Appeals Again; Chinese Teams Do Not Enjoy Rights and Need Not Contribute</h3>
<p>The three football fields within the racecourse have historically been rented by the Shanghai Western Football Association. When the racecourse increased the rent to 1,800 yuan last year, the Western Union Association appealed to all teams, requesting voluntary donations to make up for the over-budget expenses. This year, the racecourse increased the rent again by 20%, bringing the rent to 2,160 yuan. Therefore, the Western Union Association issued another notice to all member teams the day before yesterday, making another appeal, adopting the same method as last year, asking each A-team and reserve team to voluntarily donate 100 yuan, and each B and C team to donate between 25 and 50 yuan. However, Chinese teams have never enjoyed the right to play football in the racecourse and therefore do not need to contribute.</p>
<h3>Basketball Friendly: Pengbi Plays Shangxing Tonight</h3>

<h3>Talking about New Combat Techniques</h3>
<p>— Zha Rui Long</p>
<p>It has been nearly ten years since I started studying new combat techniques. I firmly believe that new combat techniques are the most suitable martial art for the modern Chinese nation to practice. Therefore, I am not only confident in my self-study, but also want to promote new combat techniques as my own responsibility. I am willing to reveal the insights from my research and contribute them to those who are interested in physical education.</p>
<p>It should be stated first that new combat techniques are different from Western boxing. New combat techniques are also different from various old-style boxing techniques in Chinese martial arts. To put it simply, new combat techniques are improved and practical boxing techniques.</p>
<p>Speaking of Western boxing, it is attached to commercial purposes and is limited by a special set of rules. If you were to fight someone for real, if the opponent used a foot to kick hard, you would undoubtedly lose. This is the shortcoming of it not being "applicable enough."</p>
<p>As for Chinese boxing techniques, there are many schools and various methods. Although the movements and postures are very good, they are too idealistic and cannot meet the needs of practical application. Furthermore, they are easy to learn but difficult to master. For example, if you are learning to drive a motorcycle, even if the instructor explains it for a month or a year, the learner will definitely not find it as easy as you imagined once they actually drive it. Therefore, practitioners of boxing techniques must integrate their usual practice with defeating the enemy in battle. How to practice is how to apply it. There should be no drawbacks of practicing in one way and then moving in another way when actually doing it. Only then can it be considered just right.</p>
<p>New combat techniques are indeed new combat techniques. They can use both hands and feet. How you practice is how you implement it. It is a "say what you do" and "theory and practice are the same" martial art. It is indeed a new combat technique that strengthens the body and subdues the enemy in modern times. I will list its most prominent advantages below:</p>
<p>(I) The practice method is very simple. Once guided, it is easy to get on the right track.</p>
<p>(II) When practicing or competing, wearing hand gloves and abdominal bands eliminates the risk of losing control.</p>
<p>(III) When fighting, you can concentrate on attacking and striking fiercely, without having to worry about what kind of boxing technique the opponent is using. You can apply it anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>(IV) After practicing, various parts of the body can develop evenly, without the disadvantage of abnormal development. This is just a brief explanation. As for the detailed content, my book on new combat techniques, which is already written and about to be published, contains detailed and practical theories and guidance.</p>
<p>In various parts of Southeast Asia, there are no fewer than a hundred comrades who have studied new combat techniques with me. Experience tells me that it is indeed surprisingly effective. I dare not keep it secret and sincerely present this new perspective on new combat techniques to my colleagues in the field of physical education. At the same time, I respectfully await the strict criticism and practical guidance of the advanced ones.</p>

<h3>Grain: Rice Market Manipulators are Insatiable; 28,000 Bags of New Foreign Rice Arrive</h3>
<p>The rice market still reports that sources from various routes are suddenly scarce. Only about twenty vehicles of goods from Su Tongkun and Tai have arrived in port. However, goods from Hexia, which have long been out of stock, suddenly arrived yesterday with eight ships from the Nangang gang. There is also a rumor that there are obstructions in Fengqing and other areas that prevent them from being transported to Shanghai. For a time, people were whispering and asking each other. Sellers wanted to wait for a good opportunity and were unwilling to let go easily. Samples were rarely displayed. Yesterday morning, the inland gangs and local shops were generally solid customers and active. 客販 were also very welcome, because the way out for solid customers was to sell goods quickly, and they were cash transactions, not subject to the delay and stagnation of speculators and hoarders, so they were willing to accommodate, and the price was only raised by two or three cents. Unexpectedly, a group of speculators considered it to be the effectiveness of rumors and secretly celebrated their success, thinking that the time to manipulate the market had arrived. So they made a big move, colluding with hoarders, on the one hand, they frantically raised the price of the profitable goods and threw them out, and on the other hand, they searched for cheaper goods everywhere and lowered the price to pull them in. The 客販 also mistakenly believed it was a good opportunity and were unwilling to let go, so they all shouted wildly. Ruochang glutinous rice even broke through the 41-42 yuan mark. As a result, it went beyond the right track, but it was easy to distinguish the real from the false, and it was difficult to achieve the facts. Furthermore, there was already a lot of stock in the Shanghai warehouses, and although the price of foreign rice was difficult to match the market price and sales were stopped, the number that had been already agreed upon was huge. In addition to those that had already arrived in port, there were still more on the way. The mentality of the average solid customer was not like that of the speculators who were only seeking profit and taking risks. They always held a steady approach, advancing if they could, otherwise willing to stand by. Now that the market was mixed again and the prices were inaccurate, they felt thorny, so they all changed course and watched without advancing. The sales floor suddenly became sluggish. At the same time, the huge amount of foreign rice held by the Northern Ocean Gang continued to be thrown out. Seeing that the market had lost its momentum, they immediately loosened their sales of Saigon, which had risen from 35.5 yuan in the morning, to 34.5 yuan. The speculators, in this environment, were brutally hit on the head by the foreign rice, and the stagnation of the solid customers made them feel that they had lost their effect and could not manipulate the market. They had to hang their heads in dejection. By the close of the market, everything was flat and there was no revitalization. As a result, the closing price, although weary from the earlier wild surge, was still half a yuan to one yuan higher than the previous market price, regardless of the glutinous rice or pointed rice. The total volume of transactions in the unified market was nearly 10,000 bags.</p>
<p>客秈 arrivals yesterday were continuously reported. More than 6,000 bags arrived before and after. The sellers were optimistic and did not display samples, and the price of foreign rice was reported to have increased, which made people even more optimistic. In addition, the 客囤 were very greedy, and speculation was particularly active, so the price suddenly soared by more than one yuan. The market turned silent with actual sales, and more floating and profit-taking 客囤 returned to sell, so the market began to soften, but high-quality 客秈 still required 34.5 yuan. Nearly 3,000 bags were traded.</p>
<p>Foreign rice telegraphs increased by one or two yuan yesterday. All previous negotiations have been abandoned. The market atmosphere suddenly became tense. Although there were continued arrivals from Hong Kong, the price was shouted up again by one yuan. Annamese glutinous rice was 35 yuan and 34.5 yuan, Saigon was 34 yuan and 33.5 yuan. More than 2,000 bags were opened all day.</p>
<p>A large batch of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday morning, Taihe Company and Jiaying Transport transported 13,657 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. They are currently unloading. Furthermore, the Suzhou wheel entered the port in the evening, also transporting a large batch of 14,535 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The holds will be opened and unloaded today. The two wheels transported a total of 28,192 bags of foreign rice.</p>
<h3>Wheat Sets a Record - Selling at Twelve Yuan</h3>
<p>The flour market is quite tight. The northbound and southbound gangs of customers are consistently reporting that business is continuous. The local shops are also seeing continued greed. The cause is that in the rising tide of commodity prices, the price of rice is close to 40 yuan and the price of wheat has reached 12 yuan. Therefore, people are looking upward and hoarding goods. The recycled goods in the market are rarely released. Paoche flour is already selling for 7.6 yuan, and the factories are still holding on, unwilling to sell more. The total volume of transactions in the unified market is more than 50,000 bags. It is rumored that there are also a small number of by-product flours being sold. The price of Hong Liu Hai brand is 5.3-4 yuan, and the price of the Japanese Phoenix brand flour has also risen to more than 7 yuan.</p>
<p>The trend of the wheat market continues to grow and increase, rising sharply. The reason is that the price of inland production has been driven up by the price of rice, and the sources are becoming even more scarce. The sellers' intentions are becoming stronger. The highest price of wheat must be sold at 12 yuan. Yesterday, it set a record. The market and warehouses were absorbing it greatly. The factories also had to release the price to take over the business. The total volume of factory business in the unified market was 18,000 bags. There were fifteen or sixteen vehicles of warehouse delivery, and the price was decided from 12 yuan to 11.56 yuan. The market still has a rising trend.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans from South China are Actively Procured, Market Price Continues to Rise by Five or Six Cents; Sesame is Also Good, Rising by More Than One Yuan</h3>
<p>Soybeans: In the state of tense sentiment in the market, the gangs from South China were aroused to procure goods, causing the warehouses and shops on the street to become even more excited. Under the vigorous lifting by all parties, the market price continued to rise by five or six cents. 1,600-1,700 bags of Wuhu beans were traded. The price is detailed in the market price column. 1,400 bags of Anqing beans, 600 bags of Nanjing beans, 450 bags of Dingjiazhou beans, 300 bags of Jiangbei beans, and 500 bags of Chongming sand yellow.</p>
<p>Sesame: Although there were no inquiries from foreign firms for actual sales yesterday, the general mentality of doing business was lively. The market price has risen by more than one yuan compared to the tired time. 200 bags of Yangzhou sesame were opened, and the price was 27.2 yuan. 200 bags of Wuhu sesame, and the price was 28.5 yuan. 150 bags of Hankou sesame, and the price was 29 yuan.</p>
<p>Beans: 3,460 bags were exported to Hong Kong today, and 50 bags were transported to Haikou. Another 3,470 bags and 115 bags of raw peanuts were transported to Singapore, and 1,530 bags of raw peanuts were transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake: Connected to Soybean Oil, 90 Yuan Mark, Road Goods Side-by-Side with Spot Market</h3>
<p>Soybean oil: Because the general players are stirring up trouble, the chips on the market are being drawn tighter and tighter, people's minds are firmly bullish, and the market price is jumping horizontally. Yesterday, the price of Dalian oil in the market broke through the 90 yuan mark, having opened up to 93.5 yuan, but only ten barrels were traded. Qingdao oil was 192 yuan, with 40 barrels traded. Local factory oil was 74 yuan, with 100担 traded. Yinqi oil was 69 yuan, opened 300 pieces. Qingqi oil was 68 yuan, 50 pieces. Jiaozhou oil was 67 yuan, 100 pieces. The price of road goods has been shoulder-to-shoulder with the spot oil.</p>
<p>The rising wind of raw oil has slowed down slightly. The Jiaozhou oil was handled by the local warehouse gangs, the original price was 70 yuan, 100 pieces. The Hong Kong gang took 500 cans of Yantai hearing oil, the price was 92 yuan.</p>
<p>4,255 cans of raw oil and 600 cans of sesame oil were transported to Hong Kong on the 29th.</p>
<h3>Finance Following Five Days of Continuous Gains, Gold Market Experienced a Minor Correction Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market's trading was active in the morning, continuing the bullish trend of the past few days. Furthermore, the exchange rate market reported a contraction, coupled with aggressive price increases by certain gold firms, leading to a peak price of 3,935 yuan at the opening. However, news soon emerged of tightened exchange rates in Tianjin, and a bullion dealer from the Tianjin group began buying. Unfortunately, the exchange rate market suddenly loosened, and securities firms sold off large quantities. Cash gold firms and jewelry shops also sold into the market, making it difficult to maintain the original position. The price once fell to a low of 3,860 yuan. Subsequently, securities firms re-entered the market after making profits, and by the noon closing, the price had recovered by ten yuan, reaching 3,870 yuan. In the afternoon, due to further softening of the exchange rate market, the opening price rose by twenty yuan, and soon after, it increased by another five yuan. At that time, securities firms turned to buying, and bullion dealers also rushed in. However, unexpectedly, a certain bullion dealer suddenly started selling, and others, such as securities firms, repeatedly sold off, causing the price to plummet to 3,861 yuan. Although a certain gold firm bought in some, raising the price by over ten yuan, the final result was only 2,870 yuan, a decrease of ten yuan compared to the previous day. Trading remained brisk, with an estimated volume of around 2,000 taels. Jewelry gold was marked down by five yuan, while customs gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Price Decreased by Ten Yuan</p>
<p>This morning, each bar (ten taels) initially continued the bullish momentum of the previous few days, and the foreign exchange market opened weak. Those shouting to buy were momentarily tense. A certain gold firm was particularly aggressive. Until the market opened at 9:30 AM, the price was raised by 55 yuan. A certain gold firm bought 20 taels from securities firms at 3,935 yuan. Unexpectedly, after the opening, cash gold firms sold at the higher price, and the exchange rate market stopped tightening and started to strengthen. A certain firm's buying appetite diminished, and the price immediately fell back by 30 yuan. The same firm sold 10 taels to a certain bullion dealer for 3,905 yuan. At that time, a certain bullion dealer continued to absorb, increasing the price by 15 yuan. A certain bullion dealer bought 10 taels from jewelry shops for 3,920 yuan. Subsequently, bullish securities firms began selling, and cash gold firms continued to sell, causing a further decrease of 25 yuan. Securities firms sold 50 taels to bullion dealers for 3,895 yuan. Later, due to renewed buying interest from a certain gold firm and follow-up buying from retail investors, the price rose again to 3,920 yuan. Soon after, as the exchange rate market continued to stabilize, securities firms and bullion dealers rushed to sell, and jewelry shops also frequently came to hedge. Moreover, the buying appetite weakened, and the price plummeted by 60 yuan. A bullion dealer sold 20 taels to a certain jewelry shop for 3,860 yuan. Approaching noon, the foreign exchange market turned stable, and securities firms slightly recovered profits and re-entered the market, raising the price by 22 yuan. Securities firms bought 30 taels from a gold firm for 3,881 yuan. Later, a certain bullion dealer reversed and sold on behalf of floating accounts, decreasing the price by 12 yuan. Jewelry shops sold 10 taels to cash gold firms for 3,870 yuan as the noon closing price. The market initially opened in the afternoon, because the exchange rate market was reported weak, and securities firms and bullion dealers competed to release orders and absorb. The opening price was raised by 20 yuan. Securities firms bought 10 taels from jewelry shops for 3,890 yuan. Later, a certain gold firm and a certain bullion dealer came to sell, immediately decreasing the price by 10 yuan. Bullion dealers sold 20 taels to securities firms for 3,880 yuan. At that time, securities firms continued to raise the price, and sellers were scarce, further raising the price by 15 yuan. Securities firms bought 30 taels from a certain gold firm for 3,895 yuan. After entering, bullish bullion dealers once again sold, and securities firms also came to sell. Furthermore, the foreign exchange market had stopped tightening and turned stable. The buying appetite was unusually weak, and soon the price plummeted by 34 yuan. Bullion dealers sold 30 taels to a certain gold firm for 3,861 yuan. Later, a certain firm supplemented its position after making profits, recovering 17 yuan. A certain gold firm bought 20 taels from a bullion dealer for 3,878 yuan. Near the closing time, a certain bullion dealer sold dozens of taels, further decreasing the price by 8 yuan. Bullion dealers mutually traded 20 taels for 3,870 yuan as the evening closing price. The result was a decrease of ten yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 75 yuan throughout the day. The gold owned by cash gold firms was sold at a price ten yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the purchased gold was reduced by more than twenty yuan. The current margin gold price is about fifty to sixty yuan lower than the listed gold price, but transactions are scarce.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Marked Down by Five Yuan</p>
<p>Jewelry gold per tael was initially offered by Da Tong firms at 395 yuan. By noon, it was marked down by five yuan, and there were no further changes. In the end, Da Tong firms revised the price to 390 yuan. The prices were the same at Xin Tong firms, and the purchase price was reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Exchange Market Quiet</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market was quiet yesterday. HSBC's listed prices did not change. The black market exchange rates for British and American currencies did not fluctuate as much as in the previous two days, and the underlying trend had stabilized slightly, but people still felt uneasy. In the initial market, the Jewish speculator George Chih-fu began buying, causing a slight tightening after the opening. Later, due to Hong Kong Electric's willingness to sell, speculators did not lack selling. Although Sassoon and Jardine Matheson absorbed, supply exceeded demand, and the market turned weaker. At that time, the British pound was quoted at 4 shillings 8.4375 pence, and the US dollar reached 7.90625 yuan. Subsequently, Jardine Matheson's buying appetite became stronger, and by the noon closing, the market had slightly tightened, to 4 shillings 8.28125 pence and 7.875 yuan. The market trend softened again in the afternoon. Jardine Matheson continued to buy, and since trading was quiet, there was a feeling of a lack of positions. The British pound tightened again to 4 shillings 7.8125 pence, and the US dollar again appeared at 7.8125 yuan. In the end, some bullion dealers sold some, and the market turned stable. Until the close of trading, there was no change. The closing prices were 4 shillings 8.125 pence and 7.84375 yuan, compared to the previous day, the British pound did not move, while the US dollar decreased by 0.03125 yuan, due to the continued decline of the US-British exchange rate by 0.075 yuan. The futures market was similar to the spot market.</p>
<p>George Chih-fu First Concluded Buying</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London long-term rate was stable, the New York silver price was still stable, and the London raw gold price was fixed. Exchange rates for British currency against US currency and against French currency were stable, and against Shanghai currency contracted by 0.00125. US currency against British currency decreased by 0.075, against Shanghai currency fell by 0.15 yuan, and against French currency decreased by a little. The central listed prices for various currencies were like those for fen. The opening prices for cash sales at banks in the morning were British currency at 4 shillings 7.78125 pence and US currency at 7.78125 yuan. Compared to the previous day, US currency was tighter than British currency, by 0.03125 for British currency and 0.09375 for US currency, which was due to the decline in exchange rates. After the opening, the Jewish merchant George Chih-fu first came to buy, paying Hua Bi bank cash price of 4 shillings 7.75 pence for British currency. At that time, the US currency also softened to 7.75 yuan. Soon, Chinese merchants came to sell foreign bank cash US currency at 7.8125 yuan, and the situation slightly stabilized. HSBC's listed exchange rates were announced as unchanged, and the silver equilibrium tax was also announced as unchanged. After that, Hong Kong banks did not sell, and Chinese merchants continued to sell. Although Jardine Matheson and Ewo took the opportunity to absorb, the positions still felt abundant, so the market continued to stabilize. It is estimated that Hong Kong banks and the American bank Chase sold cash US currency to Jardine Matheson and Sassoon for 7.875 and 7.90625 yuan. Then, Hong Kong banks and Chinese merchants sold cash British currency to foreign banks like Sassoon and Ewo for 4 shillings 8.125 pence and 8.4375 pence. Approaching noon, Ewo's buying appetite strengthened, so the situation slightly improved. Until the noon closing, the cash sales prices at banks were British currency at 4 shillings 8.28125 pence and US currency at 7.875 yuan, compared to the morning opening, British currency increased by 0.046875 and US currency strengthened by 0.09375.</p>
<p>Closing Price for British Currency Stable, US Currency Slightly Tighter</p>
<p>In the initial market of the afternoon, sellers were quite scarce, and Ewo still had buying appetite, so the market slightly softened. British currency fell to 4 shillings 7.78125 pence, and US currency described as 7.8125 yuan. Later, a bullion dealer came to sell US currency bills to Chase bank for 7.875 yuan. Until the evening closing, the cash sales prices at banks were British currency at 4 shillings 8.125 pence and US currency at 7.84375 yuan. The twelve-month British currency was 4 shillings 7.75 pence and US currency was 7.71875 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, both the current and future British currency had no difference, while US currency was slightly tighter by 0.03125 yuan.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Spot US Dollar Exchange Rate Decreased</p>
<p>A telegram from Hong Kong on the 28th reported that the exchange market opened stable this morning. Both current and future British currency were unchanged. Spot US currency was tighter by 0.0625, at 14.375 yuan. Spot Shanghai currency decreased by 2 yuan, to 308 yuan. Spot Japanese currency was tighter by 0.25, at 104 yuan.

"Joint Notes" on the black market were cheaper by 1 yuan, at 89 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Pounds and Gold Bills Decreased</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the demand for foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, decreased, and the market loosened. The market price for British and American gold bills weakened. American gold bills were initially strong, once rising to 12.9 yuan. Subsequently, customers supplied enthusiastically, and the market price frequently softened, decreasing to 12.5 yuan in the evening market. Demand for French franc bills was strong, and the market price was firm. The market price for Japanese gold bills was 1.2555 yuan. Korean bills were also weak, with an evening market price of 1.135 yuan. Yesterday's market prices were British and American gold pounds both decreased by 0.5 yuan, British gold bills decreased by 0.2 yuan, American gold bills decreased by 0.05 yuan, French franc bills increased by 0.0008 yuan, and other currencies did not change.</p>
<h3>Securities Internal Debt Showing Mixed Gains and Losses</h3>
<p>The securities black market was listless and sluggish yesterday. The excitement of the previous day subsided, and people returned to uncertainty. A group of retail investors who had been following the trend turned from bullish to bearish because the market price had first risen and then fallen the previous day. Yesterday, when the opening price showed limited losses, they rushed to cover their positions. As a result, Class C bonds re-emerged above the 7 yuan mark after initially falling below it. The market price relied on this to hold up. However, this kind of floating short covering, driven by following the trend, was not formal buying to increase positions, so the foundation was still floating and insubstantial. Yesterday morning, the opening price was relatively low. Class C bonds opened below 7 yuan, and then, due to floating short covering, re-emerged above 7 yuan. It was observed that the price had already fluctuated many times around the 7 yuan mark, and further changes were still to come. The market was initially firm and then tired in the afternoon, with only slight fluctuations. Covering transactions only slightly embellished the market. As a result, the number of gains and losses offset each other, and the number was not more than 0.05 or 0.1 yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated to be around 500,000. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, a small number of shares of the Commercial Press were traded, with a price of 67.75 yuan.</p>
<p>The underlying trend of the stock market at the Public Industry Association yesterday was strong. Public interest was less than in previous days. Rubber stocks were also firm, although trading was sparse. There were still many inquiries about various stocks.</p>
<p>The managers of the Kiao Lao Fo and Ying Gu Da Chu Rubber Limited Companies, both managed by the Shanghai Hui Tong Foreign Firm, have been resolved by the board of directors of each company to pay the first interim dividend for 1939 on December 12. Kiao Lao Fo will continue to pay 0.05 yuan per share (together with the first household payment of 0.05 yuan, a total of 0.1 yuan has been paid). Ying Gu Da Chu will continue to pay 0.2 yuan per share (together with the first payment of 0.2 yuan, a total of 0.4 yuan has been paid).</p>
<p>The fourteenth lottery for the Shanghai Disaster Area Reconstruction Public Bonds of the Republic of China, 21st Year, will be held at the HSBC Bank at 12 The Bund, Shanghai, at 4:00 PM on December 6. The number of branches to be drawn this time is two, each with a principal of 60,000 yuan, for a total principal repayment of 120,000 yuan. Together with the matured interest coupons for the fourteenth period, they will be paid by the Shanghai HSBC Bank on December 15.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Raw Yarn Transactions Not Weak</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had risen sharply the previous day, returned to a quiet path yesterday. The actual cause was the slight stability of the foreign exchange market. At the same time, the rising wind in the overseas Bombay cotton market had stopped, but US cotton was still firm. People's hearts were peaceful, not as heated as the previous day. The upward force seemed to be hindered by the restraint of the small good shadow. However, Hong Kong banks still converted to Hong Kong currency to rise, and the absorption of raw yarn was still healthy, but demand for fine yarn was quiet. The vitality of the eastern Zhejiang area was not as good as in the past, so the yarn market was unable to continue to advance. However, raw cotton was still firm and expensive.</p>
<p>The current yarn farm opening and industry popularity were still good, but traders' intentions were not strong. The price for 20-count Double Horse was 680 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan. Unexpectedly, once the price was high, many profit-takers took the opportunity to sell, and the market suddenly loosened. At the same time, the opening of foreign exchange showed no major changes, and the price fell to 671 yuan. Subsequently, due to the still-not-weak transactions of raw yarn by customers, the price recovered a few yuan. It was found that 1,455 bales were traded in half a day. The market price for 20-count Double Horse fell by 3 yuan, Double Globe fell by 3 yuan, and Heavenly Lady fell by 2 yuan. Shenxin No. 2 Factory opened 700 bales of 20-count Heavenly Lady at a price of 670 yuan. Shenxin No. 9 Factory opened 500 bales of 10-count Red Double Horse at a price of 500 yuan, supplementing the previous price of 580 yuan, and clearing the previous idle 580 yuan yarn on the same day. Today, 91 pieces of yarn were shipped to Xiamen, 75 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 5 pieces were shipped to Haikou. The amounts purchased by various merchant groups are listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Cotton Calling Price Reaches 150 Yuan</h3>
<p>The trading of local cotton was still not weak. Most of the transactions were done by fellow traders. Factory transactions were average. However, the inventory was not thick, so the yarn factories, although they did not buy, were as firm in their hearts as . If factory sales were to move, the increase would be unstoppable. Therefore, the common intention of traders to collect was becoming stronger. The foundation of the cotton market was more expensive than the yarn market. However, the rising wind of Indian cotton had stopped, and US cotton was also gentle. Cotton prices could still be leveled one step at a time. The calling price for Tonghua cotton was 150 yuan, and the transaction price was 149 yuan, still an increase of 1.4 yuan compared to the previous day. Taicang cotton had reached 116 yuan. The supply from northern Jiangsu was slightly stronger. It is estimated that 5,238 bales of Tonghua cotton and 2,160 bales of Beisha cotton arrived, and 160 bales were shipped to Hong Kong. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Another news item: The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, was firm at the opening this morning. Speculators took the opportunity to buy. Cash merchants and merchants from New Orleans were all buying in the market, resulting in the highest closing price, an increase of 8.9 pounds per sound compared to the previous day's market price. Indian cotton, including forecasts, increased by more than 3 rupees. Egyptian cotton fell by more than 40 pounds per sound. Liverpool had no significant difference.</p>
<p>The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very quiet recently. All parties are cautious because the exchange rate changes are unpredictable. The factory has enough inventory to cope with, and orders have been continuously loaded and shipped on the way, so they are extremely indifferent to the current problem of raw cotton procurement. The Japanese factory has also been quiet these days, with no more than a bale of transactions all day.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods The First Batch of Products Sold After Lun Chang Resumes Work</h3>
<p>The sales of domestic cloth were not smooth. Fellow traders transferred and sold at a profit. Hong Kong and Nanyang merchants benefited more from procurement due to exchange rate relations, and transactions turned brisk. The futures prices quoted by the factory were all expensive, so the spot market presented a revolving labor. Hong Kong merchants purchased more than 100 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill, and nearly 100 pieces of coarse cloth and coarse twill. Nanyang merchants purchased more than 5,000 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, and printed cloth. Fellow traders and hoarders in this street traded more than 300 pieces of fine twill, fine cloth, and coarse cloth, and more than 10,000 pieces of flannel, colored cloth, and printed goods. After the resumption of work at the British Lun Chang factory, the first batch of products was sold yesterday, including blue cloth, printed cloth, straight tribute satin, and bleached cloth, totaling more than 50 boxes, purchased by wholesale shops in this street.</p>

<h3>Japanese Naval Landing Forces Actually Exercising Police Power Notifying Residents of Hongkou and Yangshupu to Report Criminal Cases to Japanese Military Units Police Department Officials Express Regret</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Da Mei Wan Pao, the Japanese-language Continental News reported that Rear Admiral Takeda of the Shanghai-based Japanese Naval Landing Forces asked civilians in Hongkou and Yangshupu on Sunday to cooperate in preventing crime and arresting criminals in the western district. Takeda said that the key to solving crime lies in</p>
<p>Prompt Reporting</p>
<p>Residents of the western district who encounter criminal cases can report them by telephone to the Japanese Defense Forces Command and the Hongkou, Central, and Eastern District Japanese military units. Reporters learned this morning (28th) that the Public Concession Police Department had not been notified of Takeda's appeal. The Police Department believes that Takeda did not include the Police Department's telephone number in the above list,</p>
<p>which is regrettable.</p>
<p>The real key to solving crime lies in letting the Police Department conduct investigations, as this is the job of police officers, not the task of sailors. Although sailors can assist the Police Department, they are not trained in</p>
<p>crime investigation.</p>
<p>The number of police officers and control of the Police Department north of Suzhou Creek are still limited due to the Japanese occupation of the area. However, the Police Department can still solve crimes north of Suzhou Creek, as in the recent arrest of the thugs who killed a Japanese person on Tangshan Road.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce Visited Kato Yesterday Focusing on Commercial Issues in the Discussion No Other Special Events Were Discussed</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Da Mei Wan Pao, Sir [blank] Marshall, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, visited Japanese Envoy Kato at the Broadway Mansion this morning (28th) for a courtesy call. It is said that the meeting between the two began at 9:30 AM this morning and lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes. Observers who are closely monitoring the trend of recent Shanghai diplomatic negotiations believe that the discussion between Sir [blank] Marshall and Kato this morning focused on various commercial issues of the British in this area. However, according to Kato's reply to reporters' questions, he said that "no special circumstances were discussed." In addition, he refused to continue to make comments. Sir [blank] Marshall also remained silent about the meeting with the Japanese envoy, only saying that "it was a friendly visit and the conversation was very ordinary."</p>
<h3>Empress of Canada Converted to Transport Ship</h3>
<p>The British Changxing Steamship Company's mail ship "Empress of Canada" was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the first of next month. The Dazhong News Agency reporter learned from reliable sources in the shipping industry yesterday that the ship has been ordered by the British Admiralty to be converted into a transport ship and will not arrive in Shanghai as scheduled. The Empress of Canada weighs 21,500 tons, is 644 feet long, and is the largest mail ship of the Changxing Company.</p>
<h3>Judges and Lawyers Unexpectedly Threatened Terrorists Send Threatening Letters Separately Daggers Inserted in Front of Judge's Residence The Municipal Council Has Taken Strict Precautions</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Da Mei Wan Pao, it was learned this morning (28th) that after Yu Hua, President of the Criminal Division of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, was killed by thugs on Shanzhong Road on Thursday, terrorists have sent threatening letters to two judges of the Chinese courts in the two concessions and lawyers in the Municipal Council's legal department in recent days. The letters stated that if the recipients participated in the lawsuit when prosecuting those arrested for Yu Hua's murder, they would</p>
<p>lose their lives.</p>
<p>The Police Department has dispatched police officers to protect the two judges and the Municipal Council's lawyers. According to reliable sources, a judge of the Special First District Court of the Public Concession recently found a dagger inserted in front of his residence. The judge only reported the matter to the police station and continued to perform his duties as usual. A judge of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court in the French Concession</p>
<p>did not appear in court yesterday. It is said that the judge also received an anonymous threatening letter, and his position was the same as Yu Hua's. If Yu Hua was assassinated for political reasons, the judge is now in similar danger. In the corridor outside the Municipal Council's legal department (Director is [blank] Briand), the authorities have added</p>
<p>patrol guards</p>
<p>and specially assigned patrol guards to protect several senior lawyers who attend the Special District Court to handle prosecution laws. Regarding the Yu Hua murder case, the Police Department has not yet arrested the perpetrators, which has not been confirmed this morning. Legal professionals pointed out that terrorists do not consider the system of prosecuting criminals in the two concessions. For example, if an assassination occurs in the French Concession, the</p>
<p>arrested criminals</p>
<p>are often sent to the Special Second District Court of the French Concession, not the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court or the Special First District Court of the Public Concession. The courts where the two judges and the Municipal Council's lawyers who received the threatening letters perform their duties have no connection with the litigation of the Special Second District Court.</p>
<h3>Wu Guangxin's Coffin Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Temporarily Placed in the Shanghai Funeral Home</h3>
<p>After Wu Guangxin passed away in Hong Kong at 8:40 PM on the 14th of this month, his family originally planned to temporarily place the coffin in Hong Kong and return it to his native place for burial after the situation stabilized. Later, due to many inconveniences in Hong Kong, it was decided to transport the coffin to Shanghai. It was transported to Shanghai by the Taikoo Company's Jiaying Wheel the day before yesterday and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. This afternoon, the coffin will be transported to the Shanghai Funeral Home for temporary storage, and no ceremony will be held. Wu was 58 years old this year. In February of last year, he refused to participate in the puppet organization and went to Hong Kong, residing in Kowloon. Apart from reading books and scriptures and participating in charity work, he did not ask about world affairs. This sudden passing was mourned by all in the central government. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also sent a telegram to express condolences to his family.</p>
<h3>Over 48,000 Bags of Imported Rice Arrived in Four Days The Jiaying Wheel Transported Over 13,000 Bags Yesterday The Suzhou Wheel Also Transported Over 14,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Recently, rice prices have risen again, and people are very fearful. The reason for this is that they are all confused by rumors. In fact, the source is constant. Rice stores have sufficient rice in stock, and recently foreign rice has also been coming in continuously. Not only has the price not decreased, but it has risen day by day, and will soon reach the highest peak of last month. The principles of price increases are truly unpredictable. As for the import of foreign rice, over 48,000 bags have arrived in Shanghai in four days. The Taikoo Company's Sichuan Wheel transported 20,658 bags of foreign rice on the 25th. The Jiaying Wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, bringing 13,657 bags from Hong Kong. The Suzhou Wheel also imported 14,535 bags from Hong Kong yesterday evening and is currently unloading. It is said that a large batch will be transported later.</p>
<p>The Rice Market Increased the Number of Committee Members on Duty</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the source of rice in Shanghai has increased recently, and the rice warehouses have increased their stock. The pile of Hong Kong tribute rice is also being loaded and shipped to Shanghai in succession. However, the rice maggots' greed has not been restrained, and they have been buying in large quantities, resulting in a situation of rising rice prices. The Concession authorities are now sending staff to the rice shops and tea houses to monitor the market every day, and are closely investigating rumor-mongering brokers. The Rice Market Management Committee is increasing the number of committee members on duty every day to maintain market order and strictly enforce (1) brokers are only allowed to sell to fellow traders in the market, (2) goods sold on behalf of customers are only allowed to be sold to rice shops that are fellow traders in the market, and (3) rice purchased by rice shops should be purchased from rice shops that are fellow traders in the market. All buying and selling in the market must be spot transactions and must not buy or sell short, in order to maintain the entire people's food supply.</p>
<p>The Rice Industry Observes the Trend of Rice Prices</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency went to the Rice Shop Tea House Market at [time blank] yesterday morning. At that time, people's hearts were upward and continued to be bullish. As a result, the price rose by another 0.4 or 0.5 yuan. However, according to a certain rice industry leader, judging from the current rice source situation, rice prices will fall back within days. The so-called "transportation certificates" have been negotiated. Now, rice merchants from various groups are starting to purchase separately. The goods that arrived in Shanghai yesterday were mainly indica rice. The market for japonica goods was less absorbent, but a large batch of indica goods is still on its way to Shanghai. Once it arrives at the port and enters the warehouse, people's hearts will tend downstream, and rice prices will fall without being folded.</p>
<h3>Various Banks Issue Auxiliary Coin Vouchers; Restrictions Placed on China Farmers' Bank 5-Jiao Vouchers; Zhejiang Bank Corner Notes Already Exchanged; Jiangsu Farmers' Old Auxiliary Coin Vouchers Being Sorted</h3>
<p>The auxiliary coin vouchers circulating in the Shanghai market include those of 1-jiao and 2-jiao denominations from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, as well as 5-jiao, 2-jiao, and 1-jiao denominations from the Central Bank, China Farmers' Bank, Zhejiang Local Bank, and Jiangsu Farmers' Bank. The number of auxiliary coin vouchers issued by various banks one after another is quite large, sufficient for market circulation. The recent lack of market panic clearly indicates that some people are hoarding for profit. To adjust the market and meet legitimate needs, the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and China Farmers' Bank have agreed on temporary remedial measures, including exchanging and circulating the auxiliary coin vouchers in the inventories of various banks as much as possible, and telegraphing their head offices to rush-print new auxiliary coin vouchers and transport them to Shanghai for assistance.</p>
<p>Various Banks Begin Inventory Exchange</p>
<p>(1) The China Farmers' Bank has put forward its inventory of 5-jiao auxiliary coin vouchers for issuance. Starting yesterday, it has entrusted the Central Bank to exchange them at its Shanghai branch on Avenue Albert. Those applying for exchange were very crowded. Yesterday, a total of 50,000 yuan was exchanged. The exchange continues today, but each person is subject to restrictions. (2) The Zhejiang Local Bank has reissued its old 1-jiao and 2-jiao auxiliary coin vouchers previously collected. Approximately 100,000 yuan has already been exchanged. It will be suspended temporarily starting today. Once the old vouchers are sorted, they will be exchanged again at a fixed time.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Farmers' Old Vouchers Reissued</p>
<p>The 5-jiao, 2-jiao, and 1-jiao vouchers previously issued by the Jiangsu Farmers' Bank, including the auxiliary coin vouchers of the Xuzhou Pingshi Official Money Bureau, circulated in the Shanghai market in large quantities. During the first half of the year, when Shanghai refused to use banknotes from other places, the bank collected a large number of old auxiliary coin vouchers. Now, to adjust the market, it has decided to reissue the previously collected vouchers. All industries with legitimate needs can exchange them at its Shanghai branch at 539 Avenue Joffre, but each person is limited to 100 yuan. It is best to prepare an exchange letter separately. The exchange is scheduled to begin today.</p>
<p>Telegraph Head Office to Transport Assistance to Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications that temporary remedial measures have been discussed regarding the shortage of auxiliary coin vouchers in Shanghai. The inventories of various banks have been exchanged as much as possible, and the head offices have been requested to print new vouchers and transport them to Shanghai for assistance. Therefore, the lack of panic has gradually been eliminated. It is hoped that citizens will not hoard in large quantities to avoid another panic. However, the circulation of auxiliary coin vouchers in Shanghai is sufficient for the legitimate needs of the market. The reason for this shortage is quite puzzling. Regarding the second batch of fractional coin vouchers, a formal announcement will be made and issued as soon as printing is completed.</p>
<h3>Barbed Wire on North Jiangxi Road Extended Again Yesterday; Police Had Consultations but Still Not Removed</h3>
<p>At the gaps in the blockade line on North Jiangxi Road north of the Suzhou Creek, Japanese sentries have recently been extremely strict in checking residents entering and exiting. Yesterday morning, several Chinese people entering the central district from Hongkou were detained one after another and held in the guardhouse for a long time before being released. At the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, after Japanese soldiers slightly extended the police line outwards with barbed wire, two new barbed wire fences were set up. The relevant police authorities had negotiated with the Japanese sentries to remove one of them to facilitate traffic. Unexpectedly, two more were added again yesterday, causing considerable obstruction to the traffic on North Jiangxi Road. Also, at the Baoshan Road intersection, there was originally a Japanese guard post with two Japanese soldiers stationed there. Since its removal a few days ago, there is now only one Japanese soldier, constantly patrolling back and forth between Baoshan Road and Qiujiang Road.</p>

<h3>Solicitation of Winter Clothing Allowances to End at the End of the Month; Donations from All Walks of Life Never Slacken; Fundraising Results Are Very Good</h3>
<p>Shanghai's solicitation of winter clothing funds of 200,000 yuan began in October of this year, and the full amount was raised by the end of October.

Donations from all walks of life never slackened, and the results were very good. It is learned that it has been decided to end the process on schedule at the end of this month, and remit the funds to the fundraising headquarters to make winter clothing for the soldiers.</p>
<h3>Inland Postmen's Allowances Generally Increased; Divided into Two Types, Four Yuan and Eight Yuan; Depending on the Location of the Service Bureau</h3>
<p>The reason for the postal workers' strike last month was that the allowance for postal clerks was increased to ten yuan, while the allowance for postal porters remained at seven and a half yuan. In order to seek equal treatment, they once went on strike to fight for it.</p>
<p>Generally Increase</p>
<p>Now the Postal Administration has approved the recommendation of the Shanghai Postal Director. In addition to supplementing the allowances of postmen, etc., to 10 yuan per month, starting in November, the allowances for all postal employees in the Shanghai Post Office, regardless of rank, have been generally increased to 15 yuan, and are not limited to postal porters.</p>
<p>Inland Messengers</p>
<p>As for the allowances for inland postal porters in the Shanghai postal district, which were previously only 2 yuan, they have also been increased to 4 yuan and 8 yuan after the Postal Director made a recommendation to the General Post Office. The standard for increasing the allowances to 4 yuan or 8 yuan is based on the cost of living in the area where the service bureau is located.</p>
<p>Begin Supplementary Issuance</p>
<p>The above measures have been ordered by the Postal Director to the accounting department of the post office for implementation. It is noted that today is the day for the post office to pay salaries, and the procedures for the above supplementary allowances have been started and generally implemented.</p>
<h3>Tang-Character Tugs, Released, Placed Under Receivership; Flies Japanese Flag; Former Crew Members All Expelled; American Company to Take Necessary Action</h3>
<p>The four Portuguese tugs, Tang Sai, Tang Qiao, Tang Lu, and Tang Bei, were represented by the American-owned Wah Mei Navigation Company after the "August 13th" battle due to mortgage relations, and operated on the Shanghai-Wenzhou-Taizhou-Ningbo lines. In April of this year, the Tang Qiao, Tang Lu, and Tang Bei were detained by the Japanese Navy one after another. Unexpectedly, the Portuguese man Ying Kang Sheng (transliteration) and two Japanese men suddenly went to the tugs the day before yesterday afternoon and changed the flags on the sterns of each ship to Japanese flags. This shows that the tugs have undoubtedly cooperated with the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Former Crew Members Expelled</p>
<p>During the detention period of the Tang-character tugs, Wah Mei Navigation Company assigned crew members to guard the tugs and be responsible for watching the tugs. After the tugs were released, the crew members remained on board and did not leave. The day before yesterday afternoon, in addition to affixing Japanese flags to each tug, the other party brought many new crew members and ordered them to be stationed, seemingly taking over. On the one hand, the old crew members were expelled from the tugs, and it was declared that if the old crew members wanted to continue working, they would have to pay a deposit to the new company: 700 to 800 yuan for the accounting room, 400 to 500 yuan for the teahouse, and other departments such as sailors and firemen would have to be re-selected, otherwise they would not be allowed to work.</p>
<p>Wah Mei Company Cannot Remain Silent</p>
<p>A reporter from Da Guang News Agency learned reliable information from the shipping industry that the truth about the release of the Tang-character tugs was entirely due to someone relying on a certain force to attempt to seize property rights and seek to resume operations. They are currently organizing a so-called "shipping company," recruiting teahouse staff and crew members, and collecting deposits indiscriminately. However, it is heard that Wah Mei Navigation Company, due to creditor-debtor relations, cannot remain silent and is now searching for evidence to take necessary steps to respond.</p>
<h3>China Childhood Welfare Association; Development of Childhood Welfare Undertakings; Churches in Various Places Cooperate to Implement Relief Plans; Solicitation of 10,000 Sets of Winter Clothing for Refugee Children; Hope for Support</h3>
<p>The China Childhood Welfare Association is a popular organization in China that promotes child welfare. Its headquarters was originally located in Shanghai. After the August 13th Incident, in order to facilitate relief work, the general headquarters was specially moved to Chongqing, and an office was established in Shanghai. This association has been engaged in this year</p>
<p>Rescue Work</p>
<p>In Qin County, Yongji, Liulin, Qishi in Shanxi; Mengjin, Tanghe, Songbai, Taikang, Fugou, Lingbao, Huayin, Yancheng, Zhengzhou in Henan; Jingmen, Shayang, Xingshan, Zigui, Dangyang, Fang County, Gu County, Xiangyang, Fancheng, Yichang in Hubei, and other places, it has dispatched a large number of relief workers to carry out child rescue work.</p>
<p>Location of Institutions</p>
<p>The association currently has the Zhengzhou Childhood Welfare Institute, Luoyang Childhood Welfare Institute, Xuchang Childhood Welfare Institute, Yuxian Childhood Welfare Institute, Qinyang Childhood Welfare Institute, Dengxian Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute, Yiyang Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute, Wuyang Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute, Xi'an Orphan Education and Training Institute, Xi'an Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute, Fengxiang Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute, Mei County Shoe Children's Education and Training Institute, Jingyang Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute, Lintong Refugee Children's Education Training Institute, Baoji Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute, Chongqing Childhood Welfare Institute, Liangshan Childhood Welfare Institute, Langzhong Childhood Welfare Institute, Shizishan Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute, Wanxian Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute, Fengjie Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute, and other 21 relief agencies. The number of children admitted is 15,850 (the total number of children admitted before and after is more than 40,000).</p>
<p>Church Cooperation</p>
<p>The association not only provides relief to children in the war zones of the interior, but also plans to provide relief to refugee children in the occupied areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces. With the cooperation of the National Christian Council of China and churches in various places, the plan will be gradually implemented. The association has established a childhood welfare clinic in Chongqing, publishes the "Today's Children Semi-Monthly," and organizes a wartime childhood welfare staff training class, hoping to cultivate suitable personnel to preside over the wartime childhood education and training work in various places.</p>
<p>Chongqing Work</p>
<p>Because Chongqing has been changed to the national capital, there are frequent air raids. Whenever an air raid occurs, it dispatches emergency rescue teams, under the flames, in the burned areas of the city, engaged in rescuing children. In addition to sending injured children to hospitals for treatment, children who are homeless after being bombed are handed over to temporary shelters and then transferred to education and training institutions for proper resettlement. The above describes the situation of the general headquarters.</p>
<p>Shanghai Aspect</p>
<p>As for the Shanghai office, it currently maintains the Infant Shelter (116 Da Xi Road), Children's Shelter (181 Jisi Fei Er Road), Childhood Education and Training Institute (1131 Lafayette Road), Civilian Education and Training Institute (99, Lane 258, Wuding Road), and other childhood experimental institutions, accommodating children from newborns to 16 years old, and also admitting maids from 6 to 17 years old. Last year, a total of 1,857 children were admitted. The number of children currently admitted is 752.</p>
<p>Educational Policy</p>
<p>The education policy that the office guides in various experimental institutions is to appropriately coordinate child education with child placement education. In addition to implementing universal training for all children, special training suitable for the personality and future development of individual children with different situations is also implemented. The office's placement of children is divided into introducing apprenticeships, allowing people to adopt, and (selecting spouses for girls), etc. Regarding adoption matters, the handling is very meticulous. Adopters must find a guarantor, answer questions, and wait for investigation. Once the adoption is completed, a review is conducted after three months, and a visit is conducted after one year. This visit is conducted three times, and the special guardianship period is three years. The office also handles the promotion of parental education, treatment of children's diseases, and protection of abused children.</p>
<p>Solicitation of Winter Clothing</p>
<p>Recently, a winter clothing campaign has been launched to make 10,000 sets of winter clothing for refugee children in the city. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will actively support the completion of this charitable act.</p>
<h3>Ruirong Shipyard Work Stoppage Resolved; Workers' Representative Released; Demands Not Expected to be Disappointed</h3>
<p>A dismissal dispute at the Ruirong Shipyard in Yangshupu, owned by the British merchant, caused a strike. Now, in order to take into account the overall situation, both labor and management have reached a compromise the day before yesterday, so all workers have resumed work. Zhang Shunde, the arrested workers' representative, has also been released on bail by the factory. Because the issue of severance pay or reinstatement for the 30 dismissed workers still needs to be discussed, they are temporarily not working. The factory has promised to consider all other demands made by the workers, and will not disappoint the workers.</p>
<h3>Puppet Police Reduced in Shanghai West; Reportedly Transferred to the South City and Zhabei to Take Over Defense</h3>
<p>A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency inspected the area west of Shanghai yesterday and found that the puppet police had suddenly decreased. At each road intersection, there was only one puppet policeman managing traffic. The puppet police stationed on the sidewalks have been withdrawn from many locations, and the puppet patrols that were commonly seen have also disappeared. In the area around Kaixuan Road, Da Xi Road, and Anhe Temple Road, security is very tight, and pedestrians are frequently interrogated. As for the eastern and western parts of the French Concession, households are frequently searched by Japanese and puppet troops and police. It is rumored locally that due to the fierce fighting in northern Hunan and southern Guangxi and the thinness of troop strength, the troops from all over had to be mobilized to reinforce them, so the Japanese troops in Hongkou, Nanshi, and Zhabei in Shanghai were transferred, and the above-mentioned locations were mostly replaced by puppet police taking over sentry posts. Therefore, the number of puppet police in western Shanghai has decreased, but this statement cannot be confirmed.</p>
<h3>Chongqing-Chengdu Transportation Available by Ship</h3>
<p>According to sources in Chongqing, goods for export from Chengdu to Chongqing have recently been mostly transported by water using civilian ships due to the high cost of automobile transportation. It takes six days to arrive when the water is high, and no more than ten days when the water is low. The shipping cost is only over 200 yuan per 10,000 catty, which is several times cheaper than automobile transportation. If goods are transported to the interior by land, human-powered trolleys can be used, each trolley can carry half a ton to a ton of weight. In addition, there are mule carts that can also be loaded, and although the load is greater than that of the trolleys, the transportation cost is higher and the speed is faster.</p>

<h3>Japanese Plan to Open Nanshi to Establish Gambling Dens; Demand for Houses Adjacent to Concessions Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Nanshi Will Become a Den of All Evils, According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, the Japanese authorities decided to open Nanshi, including or partially including the refugee area, from November 1st, which is widely rumored. Many people went to find houses there. It is said that most of the house seekers intend to open gambling dens and opium dens in Nanshi. Although the rumors about</p>
<p>Reopening of Nanshi</p>
<p>Have not been confirmed, the demand for houses in Nanshi has increased sharply. Small two-story houses already have rent transfer fees of 200 yuan. However, the landlords have not received any rent since the war started, and now they are hoarding and asking for even higher fees. It is said that the area that will be reopened for</p>
<p>Chinese Residents</p>
<p>Is the northwest of Nanshi and the area connected to Minguo Road, including the large refugee area. Because the area is close to the central area of ​​the concession, it has attracted the attention of those who run gambling dens and opium dens. It is said that those who are currently</p>
<p>Running Gambling Dens and Opium Dens</p>
<p>In the western part of Shanghai, because Nanshi is close to the French Concession, most of them are looking for houses in Nanshi in order to operate a more prosperous gambling industry. Moreover, the expenses will be less because in the west of Shanghai, they are subject to blackmail by the Japanese, the "municipal government" and the "Peace Preservation Corps".</p>
<p>Move to Nanshi</p>
<p>As to whether the Yimiao area will be included in the area to be reopened, it is not certain today. If it is included, the area will become a den of evils such as gambling and opium pills.</p>
<h3>YWCA Fundraising Rally; First Achievement</h3>
<p>The 31st annual fundraising rally of the Shanghai YWCA has been open since November 20th. Although it encountered continuous heavy rain and severe cold, the captains, members, and consultants were enthusiastic about service and went out to raise funds in the rain and cold. Thanks to the enthusiastic support of all sectors of Shanghai, the results of the first achievement were announced yesterday and were very satisfactory. On that day, Mrs. Huang Tanfu presided over the meeting, and the team leaders reported the achievements they have made.

There were snacks and refreshments at the meeting, and the morale was very happy and tense. It is said that the second announcement will be on December 4th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Attempt to Repair Wusong Road</h3>
<p>The outer road along the Yunzaobang in Wusong was previously built by the Shanghai Municipal Government. The road surface was paved with asphalt, and the project was solid. When the war broke out two years ago, the road was destroyed by guns and artillery. The stone embankment in the eastern section along the shore was also collapsed by shells, causing severe damage. Vehicles traveling to and from are especially dangerous. Zhongdao, the head of the Japanese Propaganda Group in Baoshan, proposed to several people in Wusong the other day to repair the road, starting from the Yunzaobang Bridge in the west, extending east to Paohe Bay, but it would cost a lot of money and it would be difficult to raise funds, and it may be difficult to achieve at present. Unexpectedly, the Gaoqiao puppet "National Association" has recently posted recruitment notices everywhere, saying that Wusong is recruiting 300 workers to repair the road, with wages of 8 jiao per person, food and lodging provided, and bedding self-provided. Those who recruit 20 people will be filled as foremen with salaries of 1.1 yuan, etc. When the reporter asked the relevant parties in Wusong yesterday, they replied that they did not know about this matter. The repair of Wusong Road is only based on Zhongdao's empty words, and there is no definite preparation news. Gaoqiao's recruitment of workers must have other purposes, it is said.</p>
<h3>Hotel Industry Increases Prices by 20%; Implemented on December 1st</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Hotel Industry Association decided to increase the price by 20% of the original price due to the arrival of winter and the use of heating in each hotel, but this year the price of coal has doubled. The following is a record of the announcement: Announcement: Due to the arrival of winter, the weather is getting colder and colder. In the past, the industry should appropriately increase the selling price and use heating. However, the price of coal this year is several times higher than in previous years, and even if it is increased, it is only a drop in the bucket, and the gains do not outweigh the losses. Therefore, a special meeting was convened on November 8th to discuss coping strategies. It was agreed that the skyrocketing price of coal is an indisputable fact. However, it is impossible not to increase the selling price and stop using heating. Therefore, under duress, in addition to enduring the pain of slightly increasing the selling price to partially compensate, there is really no other way. Therefore, it was decided on the spot that from December 1st, the original selling price will be increased by 20% across the board to cover part of the losses, etc. The records are on file. It is believed that all these difficulties are also understood by the patrons. In addition to the announcement by the association to all industries, another announcement is made.</p>

By noon, the indoor temperature had reached 56 degrees, and the minimum was still above 40 degrees. Also, a reporter from Daguan News Agency learned from Pushan Villa yesterday that although the weather turned warmer in the morning, many beggars in various places continued to die. Although it cannot be said that it was entirely caused by being unable to withstand the cold, it is still related. The locations where they were found are recorded as follows: In the Public Concession area, there was (1) a male corpse of more than 40 years old at 5 Ma Road, Zhengfeng Street; (2) a male corpse of more than 30 years old at Anhe Temple Road, Kaixuan Road; (3) three male corpses aged between 30 and 40 at Wuhu Road, Xishanglin; (4) a male corpse of more than 40 years old at Robertsheng Road, Jiaozhou Road; (5) a male corpse of more than 30 years old at Jiaozhou Road, Binlang Road; (6) a female corpse of more than 30 years old at 6 Ma Road, Guangxi Road; (7) three male corpses in the east town of Fahua.

<p>the cause of the incident</p>
<p>was that the at-large Zhang Jiuguan, Wang Ayue, and the three who have now been arrested planned to rob a wealthy household in Ziyang Lane that day. However, because the wealthy household had many family members, they could not succeed. They were wandering around the alley entrance when a woman surnamed Ma, the wife of the deceased Cai Dehong's disciple, nicknamed Ma Zhanshan, who made a living selling the drug morphine, happened to pass by with several packets of morphine hidden on her body. She saw Zhang Jiuguan and others and</p>
<p>suspected they were going to rob</p>
<p>her of her morphine. She reported it to her husband, Ma Zhanshan, who told the deceased. Cai then gathered more than ten people and rushed to the scene. Seeing that Zhang and others had not dispersed, they surrounded and beat Zhang. Zhang, fearing exposure and arrest because he was carrying a pistol, fled in a panic.

After the August 13th Incident in the 26th year of the Republic, Li Shou brought her children from Ping to Shanghai, and Li rented a house at No. 25 Jingucun, Jin Shenfu Road, to live together. On Double Ten Day of that year, Li fell ill and died in Guangci Hospital.

<h3>Yongzhen Still Not Imported, Baoli Tries to Sail to Wenzhou</h3>
<p>The Yongzhen ship continued to sail to Wenzhou on the 23rd for its final trial voyage. However, as of yesterday afternoon, the company had not yet received a telegram stating that the ship had been approved for import. Therefore, it is believed that the ship is still being blocked outside the mouth of the Ou River. Also, the British ship Jess Maller (transliteration) sailed directly to Wenzhou from Ningbo a few days ago and is said to have been imported. According to news from the Italian company Yihua, the Baoli ship of the company has been completed after being repaired in the dock and started its trial voyage to Wenzhou at 4:00 PM yesterday. Whether it can be imported is still difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>Car Crash on Xinzha Road</h3>
<p>Tram Crashes into Public Bus</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 4:20 PM, a tram on Route 3 crashed into a public bus on Route 10 near the East Entrance of Xinzha Road in the Public Concession, near the bus stop. At that time, the Route 10 bus was in front, traveling from west to east, and was about to arrive at the station when the Route 3 tram behind it could not catch up and failed to stop, causing the rear glass of the Route 10 bus to be shattered. The passengers in the car were all frightened, but fortunately, no one was injured. Afterwards, Chinese and Western patrolmen arrived, recorded the numbers of the tram drivers, etc., and traffic was stopped for about fifteen minutes.</p>

<h3>A Picture of Refugees After the Disaster—The Tragic Situation After the Fire in the Slum—</h3>
<p>— New Dream</p>
<p>It seems that big fires and cold weather are inseparable. The colder the weather, the more fire alarms there are. In Shanghai, especially in slums, the so-called shantytown areas, a fire always burns dozens, even hundreds, of rooms. This year, the shantytowns on Yanping Road have once again suffered the tragedy of a big fire first.</p>
<p>It was suddenly extremely cold that Saturday, and the wind was blowing so hard that everyone was saying they couldn't take it. I went out in the afternoon for some errands and saw fire trucks from various districts passing by on Kangnauwan Road with an emergency order. Approaching Yanping Road, I could already see black flames rising into the sky, high in the air, so that anyone could see that the fire was not small. Onlookers were rushing to follow the fire trucks, and among them were a few old women crying and shouting, "It's bad! It's over!" making it clear that their homes had been destroyed by fire.</p>
<p>The next morning, I went to Yanping Road specifically to find the place where the fire had burned, to make a "decisive" inspection. I asked someone and learned that it was right next to Shenyuan, entered a lane, and soon found the fire site. The smell of smoke was still very strong, wafting into my nose. There were hundreds of shantytowns here, all houses built of straw and reed mats, so short that tall people could not walk in. After this "decisive" big fire, more than sixty rooms were burned down, and dozens of others were spared. Fortunately, it was during the day, and only one child was burned to death.</p>
<p>On the fire site, there were piles of black ash to the east and piles of embers to the west. Mothers were holding their children, sitting under the burned-out mud walls. Jars, urns, and pots were scattered on the ground, not burned by the fire. Loud cries and wails filled the air as they lost their homes. Many women were crying and grabbing things from the embers. Men were carrying burned clothes and moving to other places to live. This picture of refugees made people who witnessed it unable to hold back tears of sympathy!</p>
<p>I chatted with a few people casually and learned that the fire was started by a restaurant next door. Although no one was burned to death, several pigs raised by the shantytown residents were burned to death. These poor people had fled into the concessions from Hudong and Zhabei after the war, and only built shacks to live in near Shenyuan. In terms of occupation, most of the men were rickshaw pullers, coolies, and peddlers, while the women sewed clothes for the poor or worked in factories. The children mostly scavenged for garbage, so life was naturally very difficult.</p>
<p>One shantytown resident told me with emotion that these days rice is like pearls and firewood is like cinnamon. Normally, it is difficult enough to make a living, but unexpectedly, they have suffered this fire. In the future, it will not only be difficult to find other houses, but they will also not have money to rebuild on the original site. After this fire, a large family has the pain of having nowhere to go. It made me feel very sad to hear that.</p>
<h3>Encountered with Tianqing</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianyi</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Discussing the Economic Prosperity of the Old City, Describing the Legacy of Marriage Plunder</p>
<p>Shao Huihua said, "Of course! Without such a time, China's progress might not have been so fast. Everything is stimulated and swayed, and then there are all kinds of changes. There is a Chinese saying: 'Learn a lesson every time you suffer a loss.' At that time, we thought that a house like that would cost 3,000 yuan, which was not cost-effective. Let's go to another place to look for it. Who knew that other places were the same? There was also a kind of speculative nature. They rented a large piece of land, built houses in pieces, gave you a contract, and asked you to pay a rent of 18,000. They set a term of fifteen years or twenty years. When the term expires, they choose you from all the 10,000 or 8,000 yuan you paid before. This method is a clever one, and it doesn't suffer in both ways. If there is an honest business firm or a reliable banker, it would be good. But we can't wait, we don't know when their houses will be built. Moreover, the low cost of building their houses and the remoteness of the road are also conceivable. We had no choice but to go back to the place where we used to ask for a top fee of 3,000 yuan to ask. Who knew that less than a week later, two or three days before, someone had already taken it away with 3,000 yuan. Later, we really had no way, so we rented a three-story building with a pavilion room for 90 yuan a month, which is what Shanghai people call a three-tenant. The second landlord had very strict restrictions. The lights could only be turned on until 12 o'clock. Tap water was only available three times a day, and the rest of the time it was locked up. Each phone call cost five points, cash transaction. We borrowed their house, as if we were entrusting someone to live under the eaves, so we had to swallow our anger. But when the war stopped, those who had fled to Shanghai all moved back to the mainland. Because many families had their own houses in the mainland, why should they come to Shanghai to live in this cramped place? At that time, Shanghai's population of 5 million clearly dropped to less than 2 million. All the crowded houses before were empty. The telephone poles on the road were all covered with rent advertisements. The short line advertisements in the newspapers were all filled with rental advertisements. At that time, we rented a very spacious four-story building for 50 yuan. But we also have houses and jobs in the mainland. We have a house by the West Lake in Hangzhou, with sails reflecting in the windows and mountain scenery on the pillow. Why don't we go live there? At this time, Shanghai's real estate agents were really defeated. If they sold the land and houses to others, no one wanted them. If they mortgaged the real estate to the bank, the bankers also declined. Why? If there are houses but no one lives in them, and they can't collect rent, the land price will naturally fall."

<h3>Comrades in the Abyss</h3>
<p>— Xiao</p>
<p>Every time those foreign ships come into port, there are always many people gathered on the dock waiting. You naturally know that those people are customs officials and workers, etc., but what I want to tell you here is: another group of people.</p>
<p>That group of people are all comrades in their twenties and thirties, some wearing overalls and others wearing old suits. They gathered in a corner of the dock, each talking with excited hope:</p>
<p>"I heard that the sailors on this ship are going to be replaced! I think I will definitely have a chance. I have been a sailor for ten years, and I am completely skilled, so there is definitely hope!"</p>
<p>"But I don't know how many stokers on the ship will be replaced?"</p>
<p>It turns out that the lower-level crew members (sailors and stokers) hired on those foreign ships are all Chinese. The foreign bosses' calculations are very precise: because the wages of Chinese people are low! After the ship arrives in Shanghai, they are busy arranging those comrades, quickly replacing new people who have resigned, and naturally also replacing those who are lazy at work; and these "great powers" are in the hands of the head of those comrades. So many people pleaded with the head, hoping to get a position. After being busy for a while, the new and old comrades were arranged, and the head led them to be examined by the doctor for their physical condition. Many comrades who were not "selected" still had a little hope at this time:</p>
<p>"Maybe there will be someone who fails the physical examination, right? That kid just recovered from syphilis!"</p>
<p>After the physical examination is over, everything can be said to be settled. So the next day, a month's salary is issued to each person first. This matter seems quite serious, and the head said solemnly in front of the comrades:</p>
<p>"Do you know? A month's salary is issued first. The salary for skilled workers is 30 yuan, and the salary for unskilled workers is 15 yuan! Everyone can only take half of it in the first month, do you know?"</p>
<p>Yes, those comrades all knew it: that was the "rule"! It is said that it is not easy to be a head, and who did not spend money to get here! Besides, I heard that the salary issued by the company is more than 30 yuan each, so what are skilled and unskilled workers! But for the sake of life, no one dares to resist the authority and interests of the head, and silently, those comrades are carried out time and time again, and then brought back again.</p>
<p>They will naturally have days to come back, because the ships are regular. But after returning to Shanghai, many comrades were dismissed by the head again. Why?</p>
<p>"I understand myself!" One of the dismissed comrades said: "Because I don't like gambling! The head hopes to play poker all day and all night, so he has money to draw! We who don't gamble are naturally given the cold shoulder by him. If our work is a little slower, we will be scolded. Serves us right! Those friends who gamble day and night, the head is of course more polite to them, but look at their pay slips, look!"</p>
<p>Look! It is written clearly on the pay slips of those gambling comrades: how much is the total salary for one year, how much has been borrowed on the way, how much is owed, and how much should be paid for various fees and donations. In summary, what? After working hard for a year, they only saved three old foreign coins! Some even owe the head money, because he lost too much.</p>
<p>These comrades are always in the abyss, and are always a poor wretch! They are just a group of slaves in the abyss.</p>
<p>Does anyone think of them? Those poor slaves!</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Ma Xiangbo</h3>
<p>— Xiang Weichen</p>
<p>Mr. Xiang Weichen from Ruian had a 40-year friendship with Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a centenarian from Danyang. When he heard that Old Xiang had passed away in Liangshan, he mourned Old Xiang with a couplet:</p>
<p>The world has many teachers, but China has only one centenarian.</p>
<p>May the spirits in the emperor's court protect the Three Principles of the People for our party.</p>

<h3>The Forward-Moving Artists and Audiences Should Cherish the True Spirit of Performing Arts</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Every department of the performing arts, whether it be Ping opera, spoken drama, singing, or broadcasting, has a very close relationship with our lives. It is undeniable that a play with great consciousness and a tight plot, or a passionate and moving song, can give us a stimulant like strong coffee. Even an illiterate person, after watching ten plays full of national righteousness, cannot help but be stirred by a passionate patriotic sentiment.</p>
<p>Let's not talk about other places, but just discuss the performing arts scene in Shanghai. Mr. Zhou Xinfang's performance in "Meishan Hen" (Regret at Meishan) at the Carlton has moved tens of thousands of people. When we see Emperor Chongzhen's tragic situation and his sorrowful mood, how moved our hearts are. Similarly, "Ming Mo Yi Hen" (Remnants of the Late Ming Dynasty, also known as Bi Xue Hua or Blood-Stained Flowers), currently being performed at the Xuanting Theatre, naturally evokes a sense of patriotism after watching it. From this, we understand that using performing arts to instill ideas in everyone is the most profound and unforgettable method. No wonder some say that using drama and songs to promote justice and inspire people yields results far beyond those of monotonous preaching.</p>
<p>We must not regard performing arts as a passive so-called "entertainment"! Performers should not adopt a casual attitude, and audiences should not treat it merely as a "pastime" or something to "seek pleasure" from. Because of the deep and significant influence that every department of the performing arts has on humanity, we should all rise up to protect and promote the unique spirit of the performing arts.</p>
<p>We sincerely pay tribute to the artists and audiences who cherish the performing arts, but looking back, here and now in Shanghai, how many are neglecting the purpose of performing arts and using it as a tool to numb people's minds! The naked dance that relies solely on flesh to attract audiences is still appearing here, and the general audience seems willing to flock there to seek a moment of stimulation. Under the trampling of such people, the pure spirit of performing arts is being damaged.</p>
<p>Let us look again: the enthusiasm of the performing arts in Chongqing, where every department's performance can be said to prioritize the nation and the country, has stirred the patriotic sentiments of millions of people in the inland, and aroused the sense of justice in each of us... Can't we do something like this in Shanghai? It is true that Shanghai's situation is not free, but can't we even achieve the negative condition of "never using performing arts to numb people's minds"? I personally hope that those artists and audiences who have always valued the true spirit of performing arts can work harder and more actively. We must make the entire Shanghai performing arts scene gradually awaken from the abyss of debauchery and march forward towards a bright goal! We must eliminate all obstacles on this road—the group that is using the face of performing arts to numb people's minds! Forward-moving artists! Strive on!</p>

<h3>My Suggestions for Movie Theaters</h3>
<p>— Lu Ping</p>
<p>I am a movie lover, but I often encounter many difficulties when looking for movies to watch: first, which movie theater to go to; second, which movie theater's film suits my taste. Regarding these two points, I would like to boldly offer this suggestion to some movie theaters.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that movie audiences have different preferences: some like suspenseful films, some like passionate ones, some like happy ones, some like sad ones... some focus on plot, some focus on visuals, some focus on structure... Regardless of the size of the audience, I believe that buying a ticket after seeing a synopsis is always more interesting than buying a ticket without seeing a synopsis. (Newspaper advertisements only attract a small group who rarely watch movies.)</p>
<p>As for how to let the audience see the synopsis? It couldn't be simpler. As long as for a certain film, at the entrance or on the wall of the theater showing the film, use appropriate methods to post the synopsis in relatively large characters. It is economical and saves time, and is truly worth trying. I hope that all movie theaters will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Chatting About Steel-Stringed Erhu</h3>
<p>— Kelou Louzhu</p>
<p>The steel-stringed erhu is an instrument used to accompany Cantonese music. Although it is also an erhu, its structure is slightly different from that of ordinary silk-stringed erhus. I am fond of music theory. When I have nothing to do, I once fantasized about replacing the silk strings of an ordinary silk-stringed erhu with steel strings. Sitting alone in my small room, I played it with varying tones, and the charm was unique. Thus, I wrote this article to share with fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Steel strings are available in hardware stores, but they must be brand new and flawless, with no bends or black spots. Soak them in boiling water and then in cold water for a moment. Take them out and use them. They are not easily broken (German products are the best). Otherwise, the sound will change, and even if you play strictly, it will be useless. When playing the strings, you should tightly press the tuning pegs with your knees, lean your body slightly, and exert force on your arms. With slight vibrations, you can handle the high and low tones and bends as you wish, without worrying about the strings breaking like silk strings. In the quiet of the night, try playing a few sections of Cantonese music such as "Han Palace Autumn Moon," "Zou Ma Ying Xiong" (Galloping Hero), or "Zhaojun's Lament." The sound is so mournful and poignant, so desolate and lonely, that it sounds like "a midnight crow cawing," making people unable to bear to listen. If you play Peking opera, it is not pleasant at all, because the sound is too delicate and seems beyond its capability. But if you play "Liu Yao Jin" (Golden Willows Swaying) and other "interlude" tunes, it is exquisitely beautiful and has a unique charm, which is incomparable to silk-stringed erhus.</p>

<h3>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Two Clumsy Young Masters in the Peking Amateur Opera Circle</p>
<p>Beijing is an ancient city of six or seven hundred years, and there are many large mansions of princes and nobles. It is not uncommon for each mansion to have hundreds of rooms. However, if the owner of such a large courtyard becomes poor, sometimes they cannot even afford sesame seed cakes. Often, one can see vendors selling sesame seed cakes and peanuts in front of the gates of large mansions, yelling and scolding at the gate for a long time, but no one comes out to pay the few dollars owed for sesame seed cakes that have accumulated day after day. This situation is probably rare in Shanghai. After the fall of the Qing Dynasty, many hereditary princes and nobles had descendants who had no ability to produce anything. After the cash was spent, they could initially auction off some antiques and furniture. After that was spent, they had to call the small drum player (a profession unique to Beijing, specializing in buying old items, carrying a pole and using a small drum to signal). When they got to the point of selling junk, they were not far from selling the house. Because these types of residences are large, if the previous owner of the house had buried some gold, silver, and jewelry under the floorboards of a certain courtyard or room, or inside the walls, and then encountered an unexpected assignment to an official position in another location, or died suddenly of illness, or did not tell his descendants where the treasure was hidden before his death, then when the new owner of the house renovated it, they could often obtain an unexpected fortune, which, after deducting the cost of buying the house, would probably be several times the profit. The most famous Beijing ×× Hospital is said to have been built so magnificently because it obtained this unexpected fortune. There are also a few other places, but I will not list them because I do not know the details. The two clumsy young masters I want to talk about now are people I see often, and the previous owners of both of them were prominent officials in the Qing Dynasty. I have often visited one of the residences, and I feel that it is a pity that such a large mansion was sold for only tens of thousands of yuan, and that such a rare and strange event occurred. Therefore, I am mentioning these two incidents to inform the readers (151).</p>
