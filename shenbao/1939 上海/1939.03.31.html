<p>社評</p>
<h3>釋南昌之戰</h3>
<p>日軍入南昌，日本方面傳之已及一旬，謂於二十日已入城市；故在一週之前，不但國際頗有輕信之者，外報且申論其關係之重輕；卽上海人士，亦多疑其早已不守。乃據重慶電訉，二十八日下午五時，南昌尚有電話到渝，謂準備巷戰；從知其失陷固猶最近二日之事實也。宣傳應以事實爲本，若「先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂」，是經國之懷抱，而未可適用於宣傳；中國對於戰訉，未嘗諱言得失進退，歷來具見其能信守此原則，南昌事僅其一例而已。顧有責難報道不若日本之速者，此則愛國憂時而病神經過敏矣。</p>
<p>南昌乃江西省垣，八一三後，省垣失陷者，此其第八。自中國軍隊之退出武漢，頗有錯覺者，以爲自上海而南京，而安慶，而九江，以至於武昌，戰綫整個西移；其實南昌猶在武昌之東南可六百里；復有錯覺者，以爲南昌既陷，江西已矣；其實日軍在贛，祗自九江迄南昌之一綫，約計爲全贛南北長四之一。往年江西共產之戰，先後五六年，其戰區盡在南昌之南，爲今日日軍踪跡所遠不及。抑亦日軍談虎變色，望而却步之區域也。自九江溯江而西上武昌，南下南昌，作直角形，此爲日軍在江南之二股；顧以九嶺山與慕阜山二山山脈，自西南趨東北，蘊然爲直角作分角綫；故日軍雖據有武昌南昌二點，顧以祟山峻嶺阻隔其間，不成爲軍事攻守之犄角。</p>
<p>南昌得失，在軍事上確無價值可言，較可注意者；南昌爲浙贛路之終點，東行經貴溪廣信玉山而入浙江省，更東經常山衢州而至金華，北折經蕭山而迄錢塘江南岸；復有鐵道達髯波，有公路通溫州海門。是以浙贛二省交通，將以南昌不守而受脅；此在華軍退出京杭之後，雖無重要之軍事運輸可言，然民間客貨流通。洵爲局部經濟之動脈。若日軍更自南昌循浙贛路而東侵，則路綫不免爲所利用。雖然，浙省在軍事上之價值，原等於零；蓋此次戰爭之決勝因素，決不在乎浙江；申言之，日本得浙江，無裨於終敗，中國失浙江，無礙於爭勝；故浙贛路即使被日軍利用，初非嚴重問題。即就局部經濟而論，內地生活狀況、尚未進步至依賴鐵路，得鐵路則稱便，不得鐵路則僅因陋就簡而已；何況對外貿易已由中央政府統制，浙贛物產之得在戰時出口者絕鮮，浙贛生活之仰給於進口者尤尠；是以在經濟上亦無嚴重影響。如是云云者，乃爲假定日軍控制浙贛路之推論；顧控制此路，須備重大代價，日軍有無付此代價之力量，是根本疑問也。</p>
<p>日軍若不由浙贛東侵而西窺湖南，是爲較可注意之又一事。蓋由南昌循公路西行，經臨江宜春萍鄉，便入湘境。自此道出長沙之南，一面有岳陽日軍窺長沙之北，是對長沙爲夾擊。而此次日軍之所以取南昌，若非其垂敗之最後掙扎，即爲攻湘之紆廻戰略。我人殊未欲論列其在贛西之不易行軍，湘省之有備無患；然以我人所知，中國之作戰計畫，固夙已選擇湖南爲殲敵區域也。</p>
<p>世人對於南昌之得失，視爲武漢會戰後之大事；其實僅爲平凡之一點，祇以其爲省垣，始引人視綫耳。吾人所不能已於言者，各方對於戰局，雖於理智考慮之餘，俱能曉然於點綫之異於平面，一城一池，一進一退之無關大體，最後制勝已在持久抗戰。但發之於本能之直覺者，每聞一次撒退，輒有一度憂疑，朝夕所期，惟望捷報。故聞游擊隊之愴聲砰砰而色然喜，聞中國空軍之機聲軋軋而色然喜。夫是誠可喜，然明知總反攻之期未至，最後制勝之機運未至，則或喜或憂疑，謂爲皆應勉自抑制之感情可也。戰爭，大事也；要在對方基本之動搖，對方主力之毀滅；其求之在己者，厥爲逐漸使人消耗，以促其動搖與毀滅。如此次贛北之戰，日方狀其劇烈，謂歐戰中盧森堡之役不啻也；述其遭遇，謂八一三後未嘗有之苦鬥也；姑母問其說之頗有自負之意味，然日方消耗之甚，中國抗戰之勇。豈難體會得之。默察上海人士，則頗多慨歎於南昌之繼失，而甚少吿慰於殺敵之衆，耗敵之多者；一似對方聯隊長以次。死傷盈千累萬，不若中國空軍數架飛至黃浦上空表演一次之爲痛快也：是不思之甚哉，承足與歐戰中之盧森堡戰相比擬、足見日方所遭過華軍英勇抵抗之猛烈、與日軍所受損失之重大、</p>
<p>當本月初間、日軍卽轉移其鄂中一部兵力於贛北、原有盤據贛北之部隊、亦開始蠢動、日軍此次係分三路進犯、南昌右翼自武寗·等溪·中路自虬津、左翼自永修渡修水南犯、其在武寗方面、華日雙方仍在城郊西北激戰中、犯武寗日軍一部、東竄箸溪·渡河南犯洞口等地、此方面之日軍、與華軍在黃甫港·大腦尖·加白老·灰家山·望人腦·金鷄山·鳳凰山·洞口·等要點到處遭受阻擊、傷亡極爲重大、其聯隊長宮脇岩雄·江島虎雄·及大隊長高木環等重要軍官數十人、均爲華軍擊斃、而完成其不幸之「無言的凱旋」矣、此方面華守軍英勇抵抗、非至人彈俱盡、決不退却、此種壯烈事跡、實可以驚天地而泣鬼神、雖橫暴之日軍、亦衷心欽佩、崇仰不已、</p>
<p>中路日軍於二十一日午後、竟施放大量毒瓦斯、掩護其部隊由虬津渡修水逕犯饅頭山、華軍乃予以迎頭痛擊、日飯野聯隊長以下二千餘人、幾全被殱滅、嗣日軍大隊繼續南犯竄萬家埠後、再西竄安義·靖安、另一部則南竄奉新、渡南潦水、竄高安、適於情況緊急之下、華某部生力軍趕到、竄高安之日軍遂被截阻遏、折竄奉新、華某部復予以猛烈反攻、日軍幾完全被擊潰、而宮崎聯隊長等、卽在此役被華軍擊斃、此方面戰事現尚繼續激戰中、</p>
<p>至左翼方面日軍、由永修渡修水、沿鐵道綫南竄樂化、及抵牛行、企圖以一部更南繞趨生米街強渡贛江、繞出南昌之西南郊、遂大舉進犯、南昌城郊華城防部隊、雖於無危急萬狀之時機、亳不氣餒、抱定與城共存亡之決心、繼續奮勇抵抗、迄二十八日下午、華城防部隊仍與後方通電話報告情況、及戰至二十九日、日軍大部仍在郊外與華野戰軍展開大戰、另有小部日軍、則已由南城竄入城市、與華守軍發生激烈巷戰、白刃交加、山岳震憾、據悉、竄抵南昌之日軍、已有三個聯之衆云、（三十日電）</p>
<h3>阜寗海面　華空軍摥威　日艦兩艘被炸下沉　士兵炸死溺斃甚多</h3>
<p>蘇北某地　阜寗境之射陽河口海面、停有日艦十一艘、十九午被華方由口方飛來之空軍一隊發現其位置、當向日艦投彈數十枚、炸燬日艦二艘、已下沉、日兵惶亂萬狀、炸死溺斃者尤衆、迨其施放高射砲時、華空軍已安然飛返、（三十日電）</p>

<h3>義德反烕</h3>

<p>（羅馬）義大利對法總理達拉第咋晚發表演說之第一印象、簡言之、即爲義大利深覺法國並未負起發展法義和平關係之責任、官場人士之意見'須俟演說全文到達此間後、始可見之公佈、但義大利政界人士已表示、法國顯欲對義大利之天然要求置若罔聞、此間一般人士指陳、義國對法國提出之要求、乃根據義大利最近之歷史發展、且於一九一五年之倫敦條約亦無違反之處、總之、達拉第對此種事實、不加注意、即有抨擊義國法西斯之企圖雲、（三十日海通社電）</p>
<p>（柏林）法總理達拉第昨日發表演說之後、德國政界人士咸皆保守緘默、僅謂義國應首先表示意見、各報大多摘要登載數段、而未將演詞全文刊出、地方指導報載稱、達拉第總理對於義國、旣拒不讓步、對於外國又無絲毫諒解之意、漢堡外論報載稱、達拉第總理雖甚願與義國開始談判、但堅持須以一九三五年法義協定爲談判基礎雲、（三十日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>法總理重申　維護領土決心　依據協定願與義開談判　爲保衛自由當不辭一戰</h3>
<p>（巴黎）逹拉第總理頃於本日晚間發表廣播演說、第一段係說明法國政策目標所在·國家所有之實力、笫二段用以指摘各全能國、第二段說明法義兩國關係、第四段說明法德兩國關係、其結論則願請全世界愛好和平各國、相互合作、茲將演詞全文、摘要錄次、</p>
<p>全國團結　應付危機</p>
<p>總理首稱、時至此日、各國對其鄰邦成有戒心、相率積極補充軍備、所有各種正常活動、即因之摧毀無餘、國際時局之杌隍安、可謂達於極點、或問「法國在此種情勢之下，所願者何物、餘將應之曰、法國所願者、乃在自由人之間、保持和乎、或又問法國之力量何在、餘當應之曰、法國當危機臨頭之日、即能在精神上物質上團結一致、此其力量所在、或又問法國究抱何種決心、餘則應之曰、法國決心維護其理想與權利、一言以蔽之、今茲法國之團結堅定與強有力、實乃從來所未見、法國因憎惡戰爭之故、深望和平得以保全、但一旦若被迫至不作戰即屈辱時、則當毫不猶豫，起而保衛自由、」</p>
<p>實力雄厚　不畏強暴</p>
<p>法國之力量而論、其所由構成之因素不一而足、舉其營業大者、計有數項、（一）財政經濟已日見改善、（二）以菲洲屬地為軸心之廣大殖民帝國實力至大、通者余曾親往北菲洲視察、深知其人民對於祖國、矢忠不貳、（三）法國民族所保有之精神的道德的價値、實亦國家力量之源泉、如在保持自由秩序之條件下、尊重個人權利、優容各種不同之意見、與天全民族因維護真理正義而自動團結、凡此均爲法蘭西人之美德、（四）陸軍實力雄厚、政府前此決定在軍事上採取各種措置時全國均踴躍參加、尤屬可喜、（五）法國與各國所保有之睦誼、亦其重大力量所在、」</p>
<p>對全能國　嚴詞抨擊</p>
<p>至是、達拉第總理乃轉而抨擊某某國所採用之新方式、略謂、「此等國家、以奴使人民爲自由、以毀誠文明為進步、其當局者自講爲人類福利努力、徒使人類陷於破產、此在法國、適得其反、人人皆能選擇生活方式、自由信仰其所願信仰之事、而不爲人奴使、「吾人因信仰此種原則之故、絕不相倌國與國之間、一切當以武力是尙、在法國人言之、國際關係應以正義法理為依據、非俟正義法理蕩然無存之日、不必使用武力、」</p>
<p>指責義國　片面廢約</p>

<p>所持論據　斷難接受</p>
<p>政府為祛除質疑計、茲已決定將雙方來往將會予以公怖、「餘當昭吿天下曰、義國所提照會、旣未列舉何項要求、亦未渉及蘇黎士，直布底，都尼西亞各項問題、僅僅聲明該國已在征服阿比西尼亞之後、獲有新的權利、而一九三五年法義協定、亦即認爲不復生效、此種論據、吾人當然不能接受、信如義國所言、則每次征服一地、即由新的權利隨之發生、該國在一種要求獲有滿足之後、勢必再提他種要求、源源而來永無止境、抑知法國決不放棄尺土寸地、亦不放棄絲毫權利、此層茲特重言以申之」、但法國政府仍準備依照餘所說明之基礎、而將一九三五年法義協定精神文字、忠實予以賞施、義國荀在此項基礎上、提出任何建議、法國亦願加以考慮、至以都尼西亞保護地現況而論、或謂義大利僑民九四·〇〇〇人、曾遭受虐待、實則義國僑民與其子女、始終享有最自由主義的待遇、匪特都尼西亞如此、即法國本部境內之義大利僑民亦復如此、事實具在、不勞質述、</p>

<h3>新四軍一年來　抗戰經驗與敎訓　項英（四）</h3>
<p>江南戰局變化　及其發展趨勢</p>
<p>第一，敵情的變動，我們可以從兩方面來講：一是軍事上的變動，一是政治上的變動</p>
<p>甲，軍事上的變動也可分做兩個階段：笫一，六月以前江南戰區的情況。在六月以前，敵人軍事是處以南京爲中心，以蕪湖，鎮江兩個爲據點，兩個戰略上的基點兩個戰略上的前進陣地。敵人兵力集中在這三個據點上，但是苺個據點的兵力並不大，在交通線上京滬，京蕪，京杭，國道以及交通線兩側的縣城，或大的城鎮，僅駐有少數兵力維持其交通運輸，在六月以前，敵人的交通可以暢行無阻，沒有遭受到任何劇烈的打擊和阻礙，敵人可以以少數兵力控制一切統治一切，甚至於可以三五成·的跑到交通線兩側附近的農村中去強姦打劫，很少受到打擊，這就是說：在六月以前歒人後方的交通很安全，三條交通的據點，總共兵力不過三個聯隊，從常州，鎮江，南京，當塗一直到蕉湖，只經常的駐有二個多聯隊，其他各據點不過一排人，一班人，正因爲後方交通很安全，敵人可以抽調大部兵力轉入北戰區，集中淮南，津浦一帶，進攻合肥與徐州。這是六月以前的情況，但自本軍進入作戰地區以後，由於我們積極的進攻，不斷的打擊，使敵人的交通，遭受經常的停滯’阻礙，感受威脅，敵人為了保護軍事的據點，戰略上的樞紐，不得不向我們反攻，在目前來講、敵人在兵力上的怖置與以前不同了。笫二，目前敵人在軍事上的佈置。目前敵人兵力散佈集中在兩個地區，一個以南京爲中心，一個以蕪湖爲基點，敵人交通線，可以說凡是交通要道在京滬綫上，毎一座橋樑，車站，公路的轉彎抹角處，都構築據點，都駐有隊伍，一個據點，不消說，即集中相當兵力在把守，毎一個小地方都經構築工事，作爲掩護。我們是在敵人據點中間穿來穿去，現在敵人的運動或者運動，都要以兵力來保護，輕易的少數人不敢下鄕了。總計起來在江南的敵人，有二個半到III個師團，以蕪湖爲中心的有一個師團，南京爲中心的有一個師團，鎮江爲中心的一個旅團，另外還增加了從華北來的，滿洲來的五千多偽軍，敵人的佈置更嚴密了，這是敵人軍力佈置上大的變動，這是我們來到江南地區的結果。</p>
<p>乙，政治上的動態，敵人政治上的動態，也可分為三閊時期，笫一個時期是六月以前。一，是日本軍隊在江南地區燒，殺，姦淫是普遍的現象，用威力鎮壓中國民衆，使民衆屈服。二，是遊擊隊紀律很壞，日本利用這現象來煽動民衆對遊擊隊的感情，他們說擾亂和平，治安的是遊擊隊，皇軍是打遊擊隊的，用這些事實轟惑中國民衆曾經收到相當效果。三，是和用兩面派來建立它的統治，兩面派是：日本軍隊來，打鞭砲歡迎，弄些婦女去慰勞皇軍，中國軍隊也打鞭砲，這種兩面派主持了一切，與日寇互不侵犯，企圖苟安，妥吆，四，是遊擊隊與日寇相互默契，互相不打，過去江南這現象很普遍，現在京，滬東段還存在著，五，是日本利用中國軍隊退出南京以後，沒有軍隊堅留江南作戰，所以宣傅工作沒有，日本可以在中國進行武斷的宣傅，又利用漢奸宣佈日寇作戰的消息。這使江南民衆抗戰情緖自然消沉。這是日本笫一時期的政治行動（未完）</p>

<h3>敎育部　將增設職業敎育司　各省市設職業敎育科　縣設職業敎育委員會</h3>
<p>（重慶通訊）職業敎育、在現時抗戰建國過程中、尤爲重要、敎敎育部方面、對於職敎業所重視、伹無專設一司主管其事、過去是屬於普通敎育司、敎育專家江問漁氏以爲國家全部敎育、只有國民敎育、人才敎育職業、職業敎育三項、職敎一項重要可知、似宜專設一司、負責推動、特建議教育部增設職業教育司、各省市教廳局設職業敎育科、各縣設至職業教育委員會、專可其事、以期對於抗戰建國有相協助、敎部封此亦深表贊同、現已由普通敎育司　司長會同參事商擬組織條例、一俟草擬完竣、即當提交晚會議、候通過後、即行正式成立、</p>

<h3>吳稚暉講　門外漢意中之敎育問題（四）　嚴格管理方不致失敗　國難當頭節約要以身作則</h3>
<p>什麽多敎了高深的理論、還會有危險昵、因爲太高深的理論、對好的方面第一個好講、是十分有用的、對於次點的好人講、就必定知其當然、到不見得能知其所以然、能幫助他實行之處、恐怕很少、故爾工失太忙、就止好遇到三月不達仁的顏淵之徙、偶尚講講、此外節省心力做一個罕言與命與仁的孔夫子、亦有相當需要、若對六十五個中人以下的人去多講，不但白費工夫、還生出危險性來了、最好的結果、就得懦林外史裏高翰林的見解、以爲已飢已溺、止是類書褢教養門的話理、不必實行的、因為稷先生擔任了改良農田、如何世界上有一個餓死的人、就要算他餓死他的昵，禹先生擔任了水利工程、如何世界上有一個淹死的人、就要算他淹死他的呢、理論不是太高了麼、高翰林地位雖然是翰林、人格恐怕卻在中人以下、自然懂不得了、然而他在敎養門裏抄到了只個話頭、寫在八股裏、翰林卻被他騙去了、只是一個小小的危險、更有一班大政客、他把標語讀得爛熟、滿嘴的國利民福、有時被你發見了靠不住、覺得十分時討厭、徒然被他躭擱了工夫、然而當你正在需要、聽他說得像煞有價事、一不小心、比翰林還高的地位、也被他騙去了、難得一個少正卯、孔夫子忍痛的誅了、恐怕還有許多小少正卯、孔夫子也覺得誅不勝誅、所以止好性與天道、日不可得而聞、說話用心點、免得被只班人偷了去、添他們高等作惡的資本、至於不得已而應該說點所以然、且止好博之以文、約之以禮、約即有兩義、一是在博文之中、把禮來約舉出來、一就是約東了'叫他非禮勿動、非政勿言、還在敎中去管他、管之為義、豈不大安哉、孔夫子對亜聖的顏淵、還說不了管、所以現在什麼運動、什麽運動運動亦未免太客氣、不如對於必要如此、不許不如此的事項、把運動改做管理什麽、就會有效得多多了、</p>
<p>把敎育的敎字、添一個管宇、叫敎字有效、而且管要比敎多化心血、只也是天然的趨勢、譬如我們設官、司敎的敎育部、止要一個、而司管的內政部，司法部，銓敘部，審計部、卻要四個、說到這裏、把教與管、算粗粗的說明瞭、我以為育字的養與銜事情、雖不免看做形而下、而心血値得多化、似乎比管敎還要注意、因爲養衛不充分、管敎就一定減色、就邊一個人能力不充足、精神也不免大受影響的、所以也可拿設官來比說、對於管敎、是教育內政司法銓敘審計五部、對於養術的財政部經濟部軍政部、雖止設三部、然而所化的經費、不處多過了五部的數悟麼、然而這種幼稚的比說、未免可笑、但是我再用半大的工夫、來鬧諸位三個鐘頭、恐諸位也要大加注意的、可惜現在已化了諸位高貴的時間、近乎一個半鐘頭了、再連三個鐘頭、如何使得呢、止好有機會再說擺、</p>

<p>烚赤暗市好五元</p>
<p>自晨每條十兩、初開因供求均稀、致久無做開　直至十時許始見某銀樓進金號五十兩、二千零七十七元爲開盤價、較之上日午收未分榮辱、聞後錢兌業互做五十兩、七十五元五角、後銀樓帮賣予某銀號二十兩、價七十五元、未幾證券帮與某錢兌業忽爭前均代客帮吸購、故市勢遂止疲轉穩證券帮進金號九十兩價七十七元、繼之某錢兌業相同價亦進金號五十兩、此後某錢兌業仍想吸收、奈金號賣意轉淡、故供求雙方又吿擯持、至十一時一刻見某錢兌業進同業五十兩、八十兀、作爲午收價、午後供求又轉淸淡、僅見銀樓帮進金號五十兩、價八十二元、後照上做開價有買戶而無售者、致難做開、故晚收仍爲二千零八十二元、結果較上日午收軋漲五元、現金號之本牌金售出價二千零九十元、收進二千零七十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>首飾金仍未更動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、因烚赤爲狀平穩、故仍未更動、大同行仍懸二百十一元、新同行爲二百零九元、收進二百零三元、</p>
<p>純金微長半便士</p>
<p>二十九日倫敦電、英純金因邇來英鎊趨勢略疲、故每盎司亦徴長半便士、計升達七鎊八先令六便士、致中央銀行之中國現令收買價亦昂達一千二百十二元三角、掛牌海關金未更、仍計二元三角九分六厘、上海標準標金價亦隨漲四角、計一千二百零七元六角、</p>
<p>外幣升降互見</p>
<p>咋日英純金升半便士、英美匯兌降一二五、本埠外匯、洋行結款旺盛、幸賴港電及外銀行紛紛供給、市價維持穩定、惟因英美互匯步降、結果英平美緊、烚赤開盤軟弱、但連日下瀉已多、人心看好、散戶趁低吸納、疲勢爲之一振、但實際交易、仍感蕭條、市價續形堅佾、外幣英美金鎊、股富微有拋塞、英美金票需要甚殷、外銀行續有吸納、供給尚暢、各幣升降、互有軒輊、公會交易未旺、長泰出祥康進英金票四十鎊、鴻昌出祥康進英金票三十鎊、動泰出同豐進美金票五百元、昨日市價、芙金票降一分、美金票升三厘、香港票降五厘、法郎票降二毫半、荷蘭票降二分、羅比票升五厘、加拿大票升三分、斐律濱票升一分、德金票升一角、其他各幣、俱無更動、</p>

<h3>市傳港幣有眨值說　港滙賣風陡熾　美滙需要驟增而見緊</h3>
<p>滙　市咋以各大洋行結款、依然有增無減、且外銀行（除滙　外）亦進多出少、加以港電亦中止拋塞、故英金一度步緊至洋行結價僅八辦士二一八七五、後賴英行滙豐維持、乃吿轉平、而美滙因英美滙兌趨勢、已運疲二日、致外行賣意頗淡、故結果略緊零三一二五、一天交易頗旺、港滙初因洋行扒結、爲狀稍軟、嗣後突聞路透社消息、香港貨幣、將有貶值之說、故賣風陡熾、潛勢遂止緊轉硬、終則軋鬆一二五、</p>

<h3>證券　公債少興奮</h3>
<p>買戶雖缺僅好角餘</p>
<p>證　券暗盤、昨日極爲閑散、人心初則似稍興奮，蓋因國際間忽傳來恍惚迷離、似是而非之和平消息、惟無論其爲誘惑或烟幕、而我國固定國策、斷不致受其試探、而稍有搖動、是以市價仍未見若何良好現象、默揣運日來市况萎靡、而交易即見不振、每逢交易興旺時、必因多方吸收而上漲、可見檯面流通籌碼、甚見稀少、數月來金融界逐漸收進之貨、大都均從零星散戶手中移來、因此大宗賣戶尚少、昨日經過、上午潤利·恒孚·大豐以及七號買進、十四及卅八號、又同康·仁昌號均有賣出、市價略堅一二角、午後交易極淸、協大·潤利及順享略有賣出、四號·三十八號以及德孚略有收進、形勢至爲閑散、大都盤旋之局、市價結果略好一角至一角半而巳、成交總數共計約三四十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>公和祥股見高價</p>
<p>衆　業公所報吿云、上海洋　股市、今日忽趨混亂現象、惟各種優等公債特有需求形勢、電力公債有巨額成交、價九十一元五角、買戶繼續甚暢、公和祥電車及自來水股（均連息）、不乏需買者、公和祥股重見其二百零七元五角之高價、市上不乏現款、有需求生利者、惟因歐洲局勢仍未定、而略受阻礙、未敢下手投資、怡和股梢疲、橡皮股亦弱、</p>
<h3>紗花　大戶逢低仍在拖進　紗價因之上下不定　二十支紗有感供過於求之勢</h3>
<p>紗　市因大跌之後、趨勢入於盤旋之中、但人心稍形安定、一般浮戶捏手之貨、大都斬結淸楚、至實力充足之大戶、意態仍堅挺、且吸收之貨非但不吐出、逢低時仍來拉提、因此暫時可平定一步、不過實銷受交通阻滯影饗、依然冷落如恒、惟十支粗紗津帮辦胃未絕、市態帶昂不少、但亦嫌價高、咋亦轉趨冷澹矣、不過存貨缺乏，惟二十支紗仍感供過於求之勢、且所成交之生意、都抱臨時性質、故時時上下不定耳、</p>
<p>現　紗情形、晨初開盤、同業相聚談論、大衆意態謂生意雖少、然價格下降已巨、暫時或有立定可能性、故塲中虛浮之貨較稀、市况尤平、二十支雙馬開盤價較上日價微小五角、爲三百七十二元、香港帮成交八十包、少頃實需仍滯、散多吐出、回小一元半、最低價爲三百七十元、價落後又有人來進、且多方復來收進、立刻父轉上昇、仍至三百七十二元、午後因天雨到會人頭甚稀、市情無甚變遷、大致不晚徬徨之途、結果查全日各帮買去統計一千零八十五包、行情二十支雙馬天女稍疲五角、牧羊與上日無甚軒輊、其餘稍挫一元光景、茲將各帮口買去之額量分別如左、</p>

<h3>價高招遠貨客　通州細絨源源而來</h3>
<p>本　棉生意轉趨澹泊、各廠未曾動辦、實緣棉紗市情無勁、以致意態闌珊、惟同業抵解頭襯交易尚不斷、然額子微乎其微、故市價復見下挫、通州花售價比上日再落半元以外、火機花亦下二角半、至於來源、蘇北一路、以上海價格高昂、一般販運商集資冒險裝運、價高招遠貨客、近日因之到貨爽暢、如果順利抵滬、獲利之豐厚、莫可言喻也、碼頭上到通州細絨花一千五百三十九包、又啟東來棉花三百件、茲將現棉售開之盛及額量列左，</p>

<p>外　棉市價、紐約棉市、因羅斯福之贊同棉花出口津貼、南方議員召開會議、極力反對出口津貼之說、尤以施密斯爲最、故棉市殊爲混亂、但據羅斯福表示、貸款棉之放出、及出口津貼之撥發、今年之新花、棉花貸款法繼續有効云、因之近期價跌六磅音、而遠期反漲八九磅音、昨日印度停市、預測跌一羅比半、埃及跌二十磅音、咋日匯兌略緊、折合法幣　棉價尚跌、計美棉及巴西棉每担跌四角半、印棉跌二角半、埃及棉跌一元餘、</p>
<p>滬　埠外棉交易殊爲靜寂、華廠均無交易聞、唯日廠方面咋日購辦　巴西棉甚力、共約一萬數千餘包、巴西來華水腳亦甚稀少、咋日所定之巴西棉、將於七八月間始能抵埠也、昨日訂購巴西棉者計公大四千包、東華三千包、同興三千包、上海廠二千包、裕　及豐田各一千五百包、內外廠一千包、茲將咋日外棉價格計算如下、</p>
<p>原料　類別　送廠連稅</p>
<h3>疋頭　漂染布疋　西南銷路有起色　東疋津帮進辦旺盛</h3>
<p>國　布漂染貨·漂布·藍布色斜四南川滇粵帮現銷又見起色、川帮田滇轉運採購漂布二千餘疋、府綢·漂細斜·細布·色布·印花疋頭近二千疋、滇帮購士林布·色斜·府綢·條漂印花色丁等貨二千數百疋、以前預定期貨餘額尚宏、均陸續報裝、粵帮添貨、西部較旺、南寗雷州蔴章各地新購色布·色斜·漂布·漂斜三千餘疋、惟白貨購胃殊薄、僅係本街染坯去路、辦細斜紋一百餘件、細布，粗布市盤續軟、本客銷塲均屬零碎、客帮手貨鬆價轉售、市勢一蹶不振、而漂染布疋西南現銷既盛、本街門市及內地批發亦殊生色、故市勢堅挺、缺俏檔子、售盤轉漲、</p>
<p>東　疋白貨細布·細斜·本客實銷、繼續旺盛、染坯俏檔、每疋又提漲五分、北路因牛莊動辦、津地貨缺價昂、故津帮吸胃頓濃、進各牌細布·細斜六七百件、本街染廠因色斜·色布走勢暢達、現期貨又進一千餘件、龍田·細斜最高盤巳售開十二元一角、洋行開出細布三百餘件、十二磅彩球每疋十二元三角二分牛、飛魚十二元二角半、五福十二元零九分、</p>
<p>出　口咋日二百五十件運寗波、今日又有二百二十件運天津、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋粉新到四萬餘包　本粉廠盤一再暗跌　北帮僅售四元三角</h3>
<p>廠　粉現貨市况、一蹶不振、因客帮銷塲、漸吿淸淡、南洋帮久無大量去化、北洋帮自廠盤特價後、已有整批成交、惟近日津埠粉價、亦受洋粉影響而跌、且申地船位缺乏、所辦之貨、堆置不能裝運、故新交易頓見减縮、更擬要求特別降價、方可接受買賣、廠客間互持、結果廠方爲環境所迫、竟不惜犧牲、一再貶落、聞兵船牌巳跌至四元三角半、砲軍牌僅開四元三角、但廠方對於此價、尚不願公開發表、因售價與本街及南洋帮未能一致也、至正式市面、仍須四元四角半之匯劃票價、粉市前送、備受洋粉傾銷影響、目下雖已遂次低落、恐今後尚難立足、至麵粉之進出口、今有二千五百包、由香港來轉靑島、又八千五百包、亦由香港來轉烟臺、又三千包、則轉天津</p>
<p>洋　粉市亦軟化、來源除過去定貨遂有抵埠外、聞公利洋行又新到一船、額計四萬餘包、聞此船係二十八號進口、目下存底日充、更兼廠粉一再貶價競爭、故行號手中執存之現洋粉、紛紛在市兜售、價由四元三角跌至四元二角（現鈔）、然本客實際交易、巳不若前兩日之興盛、故咋日整批交易、已感缺乏、而本洋粉同時暗盤猛降一角矣、</p>
<p>麥　市亦屬明定暗鬆、良以連日粉價步跌、各廠前定之洋麥、絡絳有到、故廠胃一致觀望、客戶亦嫌價昂、目下本麥供源雖寥，而環境已覺不良、聞暗盤已跌進七元關內、但正式交易、依然擯持、</p>
<h3>絲茶　廠絲手貨　求售頗亟</h3>
<p>海外絲市尚平定、紐約絲價未更、交易所開價、近期漲二分半、橫濱遠期貨升九元、現貨小五元、里昂各絲價未動、滬廠經洋莊尚觀望、惟囤戶手貨急於求脫、是以市氣似趨疲軟、法莊來價依然低小、僅成交一六—一八及一八—二〇條紋三十担、本返開一六七〇元、揚返扯價一六八〇元、內銷仍不起、昨綢廠採購輯里經數十担、價九百二十元、</p>
<h3>杜粳賣方心理强</h3>
<p>買方轉形冷淡</p>
<p>米店明加四角</p>
<p>咋日各帮來源祇到河下十五號、各地車輪包子全數無到、故售方心思頗堅、早市喊聲殊高、詎本街店胃自前日動後、又復觀望、囤戶亦鮮問津、迺形勢平淡、市面呈雙方相持之局、結果若厚薄粳價勉爲站住、實則如河下貨巳帶軟幾分、總之回顧一週市面、時高時低、形勢不脫盤旋之局面、杜洋尖埠尖變元等各花色市無上落、</p>
<p>查米糧進出口、今有三千七百九十七包、由香港來轉往靑島、又三千五百包、亦山香港來轉往天津、</p>
<p>門售米價、咋由米號業正式通吿打破限慣、其名義爲佣金車雜各費、每石另加法幣四角、自四月一日起實行、仍謂於顧全民食之中、寓維持限價之意、其實不過化秘密爲公開、足見米業所謂維持限價云云、亦不過塗飾視聽而已、</p>
<h3>高洋米不肯輕脫　客秈中次平庸</h3>
<p>客秈前日本街消化活潑後、行囤隨多趁機求脫、故昨日晨一度熱鬧而呈起色後、旋又轉居站定之局、惟市上羊尖與洋米均見挺俏、客秈交易仍有三千石之譜、大部由本街各戶辦去、行囤應酬不多、行情與前市無大出入、祇中次貨略形見平、洋米大市貨仍開十七元左右、惟洋行所有之寶塔牌因品質較高、不肯隨市輕脫、故喊價較高三四角云、</p>
<h3>油市　豆油升降　視連市爲依歸　生油滯銷見疲</h3>
<p>豆油　升降樞紐、仍不脫大連操縱之牽制、咋晨連電始漲終跌、致本市人心爲之一日三變、開盤即騰踊二三角、中途下瀉、且跌過漲風之半、結果復向前進、原因日商所拋之期油、在輪位不敷商運之情形下、似三井三華洋行陸續抵空、良以期市反高出現貨價、昨日市塲中除現油外、完全是投機商互做交易、計現油成交烟歧油一百五十件、價爲二十三元九角、連歧大簍三十件、價爲三十元零八角、又四月份交二百件、價爲三十元七角·七角半、現大連油五十桶、價爲三十三元二角半、又三月下裝五十桶、價爲三十三元二角半、四月份交一千餘桶、價爲三十三元三角半至三十三元一角半、五月份六百桶、價自三十三元三角至三十三元一角、</p>
<p>生油　市况之弱點、已有顯著、蓋因銷路狹隘、來源已無到、聞靑島方面、決定六千件陸續放行、故市再呈渙散、行情在豆油之漲潮中、幸未見過辱、昨市祇跌二角、成交膠州油二十件、價爲二十八元二角、烟台聽裝油五百聽、價爲三十七元、</p>
<h3>煤炭　印煤交易零星</h3>
<p>印度烟煤、客帮觀望、無　批交易、同業行家、亦因成本高昂、不願輕脫、致成擯持之局、昨某行雖有零星做開、但亦動而不暢、計開一號印度塊每噸四十二元、二號四十元、下身屑子四十一元、行槓自理、客戶另加四元盤子、</p>

<h3>丈夫健康與子嗣優生關係</h3>
<p>有其父必有其子</p>
<p>因爲科學的突飛猛進，我們已知道一個人的語言，行動，思想，以及整個的人生，不外乎兩種因素造成他，一爲天性；一爲環境。環境的改良是有賴於敎育的普及，天性的改.良，那就必要努力於優生。常此雞鳴風雨民族復興運動的當兒，最根本的澈底辦法，果然普遍地急切需要著全民敎育的推進，但民族種性改進的任生設施，我們認爲至少應與敎育同等照顧要。</p>
<p>有其父必有其子。講到優生，父體健康與智慧是最關重要的。有人硏究大科學家達爾文的家系，自祖父以下五代間，竟出十六位大名鼎鼎的科學家。「將門之子恒爲將」。勇敢與體力在遺傅上也有相當的勢力。誠然一個京力豐富的健壯男子，一旦與健美多姿的女郞結婚。他們果然愛情深厚，家庭甜蜜，度幸福的生活，並且所生子女亦必聰明而活潑，發育健全，一個家庭裏如果有著賢哲而強壯的子嗣，雖然家境比較貧困一些，前途的希望也是無限量的！同時在他們父母的內心上更是多麽的引爲安慰呢？真所謂：「無財非爲貧，無子真爲貧，有子病且弱，更是討債精」。可是一般的做父親者，每不察於此，不是在早年犯有自　與遺精，就是於婚後荒淫縱慾，或因其他憂勞斷傷之故，把身體弄得精枯血竭，外強中乾，衰弱不堪，或更爆發著神經衰弱，腦脹頭痛，思想呆笨，健忘失眠，腰疾背痛，肢體疲憊，滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，發育不全，精薄不育等症，則在夫婦間不能營美滿生活，而爲妻痛恨，愛情淡薄，即生子平女亦多孱弱，或竟早殤與全不生育，貽終生大憾！所以父體袞弱，不特喪失了他本人的幸福，且將影響及於後代的子嗣，同時關係於民族國家亦至深且钜！欲謀捕救，據世界名醫及餘經驗，均公認服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最爲對症特效。因此劑於服後即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，若繼續服用，必可於早日完全洽愈，並可收延年益壽返老還童之效。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，制止遺洩，則收效尤速。</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯萎癟的科學補救</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>大概一個女子經過月經初潮期以後，生理上便爲之一變，如萎黃的面部，現著紅潤起來，腋·興局部等處漸漸長出羞人的軟毛，本來不甚豐腴的臀部，此時顯得豐腴，而位置在胸前的一對乳峯，更會似正在打氣的皮球一般，漸漸堅實而高聳，一泓秋水似的眼波，見著陌生男子，便會似羞非羞的偷偷地瞧人一眼，面頰上是時時泛起迎人的笑容，性情與聲調，更顯得那麽地柔順，舉止和神態，都脫去了少女的舉形，而表現出「處女」特有的矯姿。</p>
<p>處女眞是多麼美麗啊！可是這個時期的女性，雖然神秘而可愛，但亦最爲危險！因生理的轉變與情欲囂張，極易使意志薄弱者，沾染自·自·的結果，最普遍的弊害，能使月經異常，或因異常而停閉，於是病態百出，使主宰女性健康的乳峯發育，嚴然萎癟，卵巢機能也異乎尋常的衰弱了，新陳代謝作用，亦失卻營養能力，肌肉枯瘦，容顏憔悴，不但將來在健美上兢爭必遭失敗。而且一旦進入兩性生活，亦必促成不感不娠諸症，而爲丈夫憎惡，幸福毫無，唯一補救辦法，據中外婦科名醫及餘經騐，只有服卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」最爲對症而特效，蓋此劑配製精良。服後一日夜間即能培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月絰，暖宮止帶，如繼續服用，不但可以根治婦女各種隱病。且能使乳峯高聳，面頰紅潤，青春長駐。</p>
<h3>遺精青年的自救方案</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>青年人的所以多遺精症，據醫生的論斷，十之八九是由於手淫之故。不特徒耗體內最寶貴的生殖腺液，且對於神經損害極大。所以凡有手淫者，常患神經衰弱症，因爲神經衰弱的關係，輸精管口的精關神經常呈過敏狀態，或竟失卻了效用，所以即爆發遺精症。</p>
<p>遺精是青年人的洪水猛獸，如遺精頻繁，則神經衰弱必益形加劇，因此，凡腦力不足，思想遲鈍，健忘失眠，耳鳴眼花，膽小心驚，志氣消沉，腰痠背痛，肢體疲憊，滑糈漏精，早洩陽蔞等症象，即相繼而起。此外，因精枯血竭之故，發育機能受阻，致發育不全，局部短小如指，或精液的產生不及，致精蟲缺乏，或竟全無，成精薄不育症。此種男子，不特在夫婦間的性生活上因不堪行樂而爲妻憎恨，其夫人如性質較爲剛強而狡黠者，則與人私通私奔或與夫訴請離婚者，實爲今日社會上常有的事。即其夫人飲泣吞聲，勉爲維持家庭，則所生子女亦多孱弱，兒病母愁，家庭復有何樂趣，至於不育絕嗣，更將貽終生大憾！</p>
<p>遺精症的補救方案，在今日只有服「希米脫氏固精片」，最爲特效。因此藥於服後即能鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，夢幻減少，可得安眠，遺精即可痊癒。如有遺精已引起上述症象者，須服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，若繼續服用，亦可早日回復健康。惟患者能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療，注射，手術等法，更可保證治癒。</p>
<p>白濁論壇</p>
<p>— 淋病專科戴德醫師撰</p>
<p>診所北京路四川路轉角</p>
<p>義務送診僅收號金四角</p>
<h3>後部尿道炎並不足畏</h3>
<p>常人以爲白濁病菌侵入後尿道，便以爲本身之病，從此無向愈之望，此固神經過續之談，而又有人以爲白濁未入侵性時期，其淋菌決不致侵入後尿道，而遂放膽不以爲意，此實大謬不然。要之，淋病在急性時，其淋病於初起二三天內，其淋菌多偏促於前尿道，苟能嚴守攝生方法，及用合平科學方法爲之治療，則淋菌容易掃除，即不然亦不致於立即侵入後尿道，但是如果不守攝生之道，復爲庸劣之醫家，濫施不當之手術，則淋菌受此等不良之刺激，乘虛而入，往往有在二三天內，即侵入後尿道而變生各項種症象者，是不可不注意之耳。</p>
<p>一入後尿道之淋毒，即續發種種變癥，最顯明者，如淋毒性膀胱炎，攝護腺炎，睾丸炎，腎臟炎等。。故一般病家一開淋毒已蔓延於後尿道爲之驚懼不止也。然以餘之經驗，後尿道炎所變各種症，決不足懼。以淋毒性攝護腺炎而言，此癥在淋病中最易發生，而治法亦最繁雜，一般醫家僅知電療與按摩及內服藥等，而不知除此之外，餘恒用溫湯灌腸法，冷卻法，而其化膿時，則非立刻採用敏捷手術，將會陰部切開，使之排膿，庶可短期收口根治，否則如攝護腺炎已化膿，而猶養癱貽患，敷衍病家，以致成攝護腺漏，終身不治失事，此皆醫家之過也。然一般醫家，因手術拙劣，決不敢行此，蓋能成淋病醫之名家，貴其能膽大而心細也。診時：上午九時至六時止</p>
<p>科目　兼治梅毒。横痃。下疳。及無痛苦新法割除包皮。</p>

<h3>小兒之腸寄生蟲病</h3>
<p>— 朱作三</p>
<p>一·蟲症</p>
<p>營養不良之兒童，十之七八，患有蟲病，蟲之種類不一，總由飲食不節，蔬菜瓜果，生冷失宜，或魚蝦肉類，煮食不熟，蟲卵傳人，又恣嗜肥甘，濕熱不運，遂使孳生繁殖不已。兒童患者，必飲食减少，肌肉不生，嘔吐淸水，腹痛時作時止，甚或大痛不可忍，面色必萎黄，而鼻下帶靑色，遷延不理，營養日减，贏瘠愈甚。</p>
<p>蟲症初起，亟宜愼於食飲，蔬菜魚肉，必須煮熟，閑食必須戒除，芳香之物，切不可予，即食豆類，亦需攙入花椒同炒。而榧子一物（俗名香榧）功能殺蟲和脾，每日六七枚，沙糖水煮，平旦空心服，可以化蟲；或連殼泡熟，隨時食之，香甜可口，亦能收殺蟲之效。使君子亦驅蟲常藥，每日食六七粒，能潤滑腸壁，使蟲無所附而排出體外。驅蟲方劑，古方烏梅丸爲治蚘正宗，化蟲丸，追蟲丸亦爲治蟲專劑，其中烏梅，鶴虱，蕪夷，檳榔，雷丸，楝根等，主治雖有不同，而殺蟲之效甚確，對於蟲體有起化學或理學之作用，使蟲感受後麻醉或腐蝕致死。又法石榴根皮五錢，（鮮者尤佳，石榴實皮無效）合檳榔三錢，煎濃汁，少和白糖，空心服之，頗能奏效。但此種內服驅蟲劑應於空腹服之最宜，更或於未服藥前先食炙肉或甜品少許，以誘動蟲之食慾，使易受藥奏效。至服藥之後，宜另用緩下劑以輔之。</p>
<p>二·疳積　陳家禎</p>
<p>小兒之病，以疳積居多，究其原囚，不外濫食糖果餅餌等雜物，以致脾胃虛弱，消化失常，宿食阻於腸胃，使新陳代謝之機能停止，日久腸內生蟲，每日所食之物，反以濟蟲，於是腸內蛔蟲日多一日，形體肌肉則漸形消瘦，腹現靑筋，或隆然膨脹，甚至四肢肌肉日益瘦削，而成爲疳積之症。小兒若欲預防此症，除切戒雜食外，每日可食「使君子」四五粒，重者七八粒，按使君子即西藥殺蟲劑山道年，最有殺蟲消疳之效，能使腸內寄生蟲日漸肅淸，且服法又簡而易行也。</p>
<h3>傷風要忌口</h3>
<p>— 陳慰蒼</p>
<p>傷風一症，四時流行，而以春冬二季爲尤盛。雖屬輕症，亦能纏綿增變，故於飲食禁忌，不可不知。茲略述如下：</p>
<p>（一）忌葷油　葷油滋膩，性能補膜，感冒症得之，失其體工本能之宜泄，風寒不得外解，體溫集表，易起發熱。</p>
<p>（二）忌魚腥　肺爲風束，肅化無權，則作咳嗽，雖屬體工所起防禦外物侵害之一種自然抵抗作用，畢究耗氣損絡。魚腥爲動肺之品，食之刺激肺膩，使失自動抵抗能力，致增劇而成喉痛音啞及呼吸痛。</p>
<p>（三）如食辛辣之物甚則痰中帶血等症，均應禁忌，不可因小疾而忽之。</p>
<h3>蠻荒異物記</h3>
<p>— 方愼盦</p>
<p>余兒時，隨宦蜀中，遍歷川邊康藏各地，其物產之豐饒，珍禽異獸，奇花佳草，所在皆是；而以藥材之產，爲尤夥頣，更多異品，茲將記憶所及者，筆錄兩種於后，以補本草所未取，並供博物家之參考焉。</p>
<p>（一）貝母鷄</p>
<p>貝母，一名「蝱」，毛詩「霄采其蝱」；爾雅作「莔」，音「盲」，川產者佳，近康藏而實大者爲上品。春夏間，開花色紫而美，其功用載於本草，不贅。</p>
<p>康藏多山，奇禽異獸，多不知名。貝母鷄，爲禽之一種，狀似山鷄，高冠長尾，毛錦色多花斑，雖錦鷄孔雀，不能媲美。生崇山中，非貝母不食故名之曰貝母鷄。捕而食之，肉肥嫩而細，土人認爲無上珍品，無上補劑，惜產量旣少，飛翔又速，得之殊不易易。</p>
<p>（二）羗活魚</p>
<p>羌活，產羗中，康藏亦多有之。莖葉遍生細毛，夏日莖高長，葉如羽狀，秋則開淡綠五瓣小花，結實色紫。狂風作時，野草起伏成浪，惟羌活獨不搖動，是以入藥能祛風。土人見之，剷其根下，有碗大一水塘，中有小魚二尾，然不能每株皆有，如得之則賣於市。凡感冒之症，煮食之，得汗即解，發汗之奇品。</p>
<h3>耗血既多應予調養　「便血」食養物品</h3>
<p>— 丁伯安</p>
<p>血液於人骰最關重要，缺少血液，全身各部即不免受其影響。急性血症，失血過多，則將無法繼續吾人之生命。是以吐血衂血，人咸認爲嚴重之疾病，便血症情，雖較吐衂輕微，其能妨害人體之健全則同，故亦應注　療養。</p>
<p>便血乃肛門出血，瀉出之時，或夾雜大便之中，或在便前，或見於便後，或泄如竹筒噴水，腹痛而裏急，血色又有鮮紅色，紫醬色，黑色，數種。此外更有痔瘡下血，久痢下血，腸風下血，跌傷下血，諸症。均在便血範圍之內，治法亦大同小異。便血之病源，實由濕熱流入大腸，積熱蘊蒸而成。食物療養之法有二：（二）粳米一合，柿餅（南貨店有買）三枚，切小塊，和米煮稀粥，每日晨間，充作早餐服，頗可見效。按柿味甘平，性穡，能健脾濇腸，凉血止血，食之加强腸胃血脈之收攝力，不但洽便血，並療咯血。（二）昔有人患痢疾便血，愈後復發者三次，後醫者令停止服藥，日食林擒（即花紅）三枚，二星期便血果愈，連食一月，永不復發，按林檎含酸汁頗豐，入胃能使胃液增加，以助消化，被腸壁吸收入血中，增加血液之凝固力，更能消腸胃之發炎，故治便血，亦有特效也。</p>
<h3>飮食討論（三）</h3>
<p>— 秦伯未</p>
<p>八·六一散　淸暑以六一散用鮮荷葉包，針刺小孔，開水泡服最佳。六一散即滑石粉甘草末，不特解毒除煩熱且具利溲之長。荷葉更有淸宣作用。小兒入夏，痤癢數生，端宜多飲。或將鮮竹葉生石膏泡飲，意雖相似，微嫌過猛，易滋流弊。</p>
<p>汽水鮮橘水與花露　夏令市上最流行之飲料，當推汽水，其主要成分爲小蘇打與橙檬酸，功能和中舒氣；其次爲鮮橘水，可以淸胃潤腸。二者前助消化，殊屬解渴佳品。惟飲者必以冰，飲時輒在勞動熱甚之時，譬諸熒熒爐火，遞沃冷水，人體驟受刺激，能否不生反響，此則頗堪注意耳。拙見我國有絕妙之夏令飲料，異歸入藥用，未能普及。即花露是也。花露以蒸溜法製成，質料澄潔，氣味芳淸。約言之，則靑蒿露可以滌熱，　香露可以祛暑。地骨皮露可以除蒸，蠶豆花露可以止血，鮮稻葉露可以和胃，野薔薇露可以舒氣，枇把葉露可以潤肺；而銀花露之淸熱解毒，荷花露之却暑除煩，尤爲消夏所宜，倘能仿照汽水鮮橘汁之製法而推廣之，大有裨益。</p>
<p>十·米　關於食，吾國以米麥爲大宗，米有粳糯之分：粳米除內含水分外，以蛋白質最富，脂肪次之，灰分又次之，極能强壯身體，使人肥滿。味甘性平，補益脾胃，兼及他膝；生氣血脈精髓，因之充溢，筋骨肌肉皮膚，因之强健；本草經稱其止煩止渴止洩，乃餘事耳。惟有早晚種穫之不同，地土出處之各異。早米其性稍溫，晚米其性稍凉；出於高地，則硬而質潔，出於窪處，則潤而性陰；若冬春米能免粘　，香秔米氣獨香美，病後煮食，和中醒胃，尤爲佳妙也。糯米雖亦補肺健脾，但性溫目粘，不易消化，多食使人渴睡，身軟無力，四肢不收，發風昏憤。小兒病人及孕婦均應禁忌。</p>
<p>十一·麵　製麵以麥，麥之性質與馬鈴薯相同，而含有多量石灰分，石灰爲組成骨質之要素，少年體軀之成長，允以含有石灰分爲最良之食品。麥性甘平，厚腸胃，强氣力，補虛贏，助五臓，其功不亞於稻粟。但南人嫌其發渴助濕，產　動氣，故大人脾胃有濕熱，及小兒食積疳脹，皆在所禁。然北人以之代飯，常御而不爲患，則地勢高燥，無濕熱蒸蒸之毒，至有關係也。</p>
<h3>喉症盛行留心食養</h3>
<p>— 曹錫萬</p>
<p>今春陰雨連綿，氣候失常，故染恙者比比皆是，其中尤以咽喉症爲最著。按咽喉處人身至要之地位，操呼吸飲食之樞紐，故咽喉有恙，危險頗多，故於適當之治療外，尤應注意於食養之調節。茲將咽喉症食養宜忌之大槪分述如左，藉供大衆之參考：</p>
<p>（一）適當食養品：</p>
<p>（一）食鹽湯　食鹽功能瀉熱，淸血，潤燥，兼通二便，用以冲湯，以作飲料及漱口頗佳。</p>
<p>（二）白蘿蔔　薇蔔之白色者，性甘平而微寒，功能淸化痰熱，生吃或切絲佐餐均可。</p>
<p>（三）陳海蟄　海蜇性鹹平微寒，能化痰淸血，陳否性更相純，用以佐餐，誠妙品也。</p>
<p>（四）橄欖　性甘淸酸平，能淸肺，開胃，下氣，除煩，利咽喉，生津液；生吃或煎湯均可。</p>
<p>（五）雅梨　性甘衆微酸，能凉心，潤肺，消痰，降火，淸咽，潤燥，利大小腸，宜於生吃，</p>
<p>（惟因其性過凉，對於爛喉　痧「西名腥紅熱，」宜透不宜凉之症候，不合。</p>
<p>（二）當禁食之品</p>
<p>凡酸·辣·鮮·發·油膩·煎·炒·及一切有刺激性者，皆忌。</p>

<h3>所謂「光榮的和平」</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>法朗哥的大軍二十萬，兵不血刃，開進馬德里了，國防政府的「光榮的和平」，如願以償了，從今以後，我們又格外認淸了「光榮的和平」的眞意義！</p>
<p>自從國防政府爲利所誘，爲威所逼，將奈格材逐走以後，就從事於「光榮的和平」。那時我們所懂得的，這便是有條件的投降。然而法朗哥的靠山墨索里尼却不答應，以爲投降便乾脆投降，不能有條件。於是國防政府於努力逐走共產黨以後，看見大勢巳去，無可奈何，就俯首帖耳，讓出了馬德里。他們也許在想，法朗哥聽由他們安全退出，旣不截擊，也不窮追，果然已獲得「光榮的和平」了。可是我們這時所懂得的，這是無條件的投降，也就是「無恥的投降」。</p>
<p>西班牙事大定矣，不論那一方面的出面　演者和幕後牽綫者，都可以鬆一口氣了。然而在遠東方面，我們也一再聽見了「光榮的和平」這一個名稱這又是什麼一會事呢？</p>
<p>在前，某某兩國大使，曾勸我們接受「光榮的和平」過。我們知道這就是投降，至多也不過附以一些條件而已，我們不答應；我們還是抗戰下去。此後，這「光榮的和平」，也曾在各地，以及某植人的口頭，發出一些聲響來，我們若不是置之不理，便是痛駁一陣，這聲響才得消散下去，漸歸澌滅。現在，似乎又有有勢力的人想要來唱唱這個老調，「光榮的和平」，以維持自己的利益了。我們看看西班牙，想想自己，總不至於放棄前功，上他們的當，予以接受吧！</p>
<p>存心來誘逼我們的人的措辭，是可想而知的：你們打了這長久，實在勇敢，全世界都佩服；你們如果肯「和平」，這「和平」是「光榮的」，此後我們一定帮着你們從事復興。這是誘。你們如果不答應，還要蠻幹下去，那就對不起，我們自顧不暇，不來帮你們了，你們自己照顧自己吧。這是逼。總之，他們要我們不再抵抗我們的敵人。</p>
<p>原來所謂「光榮的和平」，就是「無恥的投降」！我們已經認識得很淸楚；我們不要「光榮的和平」，我們要「徹底的勝利」！</p>
<h3>與小墨沙利尼決鬬</h3>
<p>— Edwin　C.Parsons作　大奉譯</p>
<p>一九三七年九月二十八日，西班牙政府志願軍美人特立克·狄更生，和墨沙利尼長子白魯諾·墨沙利尼作空中決鬥，下面是狄更生的報吿。</p>
<p>我在西班牙共計作戰十六個月，一九三七年秋，在加斯德隆爲「紅翼」隊的領隊，其時小墨沙利尼指揮國民軍空軍一隊，駐巴爾馬，與我們相對。</p>
<p>那是八月之末，一個晚上，從我長官雷斯上校處得悉墨氏在國民軍電台廣播，個人向政府軍之五架飛機挑戰，這或者是墨氏用以號勵士氣的一法，不料決鬥終於實現了。</p>
<p>當時我立即發電，願獨戰墨氏，後來又發電催促，終究在三十天後，得到下列答覆：</p>
<p>茲接受狄更生隊長的提議，定於九月二十八日正午單獨接戰，地點在兩軍根據地的中央，高度一萬五千呎，兩方各帶同視察機兩架，絕對不許參加戰鬥。雙方相遇後，即作一倒圓轉，表示開始作戰。一方承認失敗時，可將手套縛在長圍巾上擲出。以上各點，請狄君同意遵守。白魯諾·墨沙利尼。</p>
<p>以後我並未做任何特種的準備，我的飛機是蘇聯的波音P.26式，馬力一千零五十，備有雙管維克式機槍四座，電器控制翼旁的機槍兩具。</p>
<p>那天到了，四位同伴駕兩視察機先出發，一刻鐘後，我也鼓勇向巴爾馬前進。</p>
<p>時當正午，四架視察機正在我上面盤旋，在國民軍的那方，出現了一個黑點，那便是小墨沙利尼，駕了一千三百馬力的單翼機前來。</p>
<p>我們同時飛一圈又倒轉一次，於是肉搏開始了。我所看到的是敵人機槍中的火花，聽到的是子彈穿過耳邊的尖呌，身上感到的是子彈打到翼上的震動。我們互相迎上，在幾英吋中短兵相接。</p>
<p>兩機分開了，繼之以半圓形的滾動，距離極近，我可以辨淸墨氏面上的各部。我噓了一口氣，回轉機身，迎前接戰。</p>
<p>以後的十五分鐘，更是緊張，因爲各種動作太快了，我差不多不能記淸。但是我每有一種動作，他一定有同樣的或者更好的。敵機馬力勝我二百五十，所以速度帮助了他不沙。</p>
<p>我的飛機震得很厲害，蘇聯飛機不能多加超限的載重和馬力，這影響我的目的不少。</p>
<p>昇，降，轉圈，滾飛，這都是幾秒鐘中的連續的動作，滑動的速度，使四肢的血脈停留，空氣一點不鬆的打擊在我的身上，發動機和機槍的聲音使我的腦子麻木，直到失去聽覺爲止。</p>
<p>在我的經騐上，我從來不會做過這樣多子彈的目標。</p>
<p>我們在下降了—一萬四千呎，一萬一千，八千……。我們的視察機也盤旋着，注視着。</p>
<p>忽然，我發現左臂有了創口，鮮血直噴，於是立即下降。這其實是錯誤，因爲墨氏正在我的尾後，灌注他的鉛彈！</p>
<p>我竭力平衡自己，制止馬達的前進，橫滑到旁邊，等敵機衝過時，給以打擊。這次我看見打中了他，因爲他的飛機蕩了一下。事後我聽見他的腿部受傷（雖然我們無從證實），我想當在此時。但是一秒鐘之內，他又回來了。</p>
<p>五千呎，四千，三千。十八分鐘，二十分我們繼續肉搏。當時我饑而且疲，彈子打破了我的儀器，玻璃打在我的面部。我想我要失敗了。但是我抓住了最後的機會，同時解開我的圍巾。</p>
<p>我裝作打圈的樣子，轉到頂上，當時我正是他的一個廣大的目標，我縮小自己到最小的地位，預料鉛彈將搗碎我的身體，但是結果沒有。當我轉好以後，我得到了機會，敵機的目標，對我的機槍好像有屋子那樣大，我得心跳得更厲害，當我的手指開始射擊機槍的時候。於是我看見他的手舉起了，黑色的物件從他的飛機中擲出，張開白色的長尾，圍巾和手套！</p>
<p>我欣幸着他不知道我幾乎也要做他同樣的動作。</p>
<p>當我平飛的時候，我看見他揮手示意，傾斜他的飛機向前，表示敬意，於是我們分道回去。</p>
<p>在二十二分鐘的空戰中，我的飛機多了三百二十六個彈孔，我很幸運的祇受到一處臂傷。此後白魯諾·墨沙利尼就不是已爾馬空軍的隊長了。</p>

<h3>容身之處</h3>
<p>— 華父</p>
<p>人生於世，按之常情，總是有一個容身之處的。然而有些人却在哀號着說，甚至沒有立錐之地，這是什麼原故呢？聰明人便說，這種人會弄到這樣的地步，實在是他們太蠢笨：何况天地本來是寬大的，那裏會有這樣的事呢。</p>
<p>聰明人的處世之道，的確妙不可言。約而言之，他的第一步是吹，用他的嘴來吹。他的嘴賽過噓氣成雲的龍嘴，吹噓一下，大可以使天地變色。若是小小地應用一下，鼓動成風，一吹出去，雖然不必飛沙走石，拔樹倒屋，至少也可以使他四週擁擠着的人物，望風而靡，給他寬廣的塲面，由他獨往獨來。吹之爲用，不亦大乎！</p>
<p>第二步是拍，用他的手來拍。他知道吹是對付同一平面上的人物的，在他上面的人物，有時就非吹所能奏效，若是一味吹，就不能呌他們不壓下來。這還須應用到拍，向上拍。好在在上面的人物，都是吃這一功的，只要你肯拍，他們便會像皮球，像氣球，輕飄飄地騰空而起，在你的頂上留出充份的空問，由你鑽出頭來。</p>
<p>普通的聰明人，到了吹拍皆所擅長的地步，也就處境裕如，優遊自得，不再轉什麽別的念頭，就此適可而止了、獨有一般善心的聰明人，却還要更進一步，來擴充他的容身之處。這更進一步的第二步是踏，用他的脚來踏。</p>
<p>踏的妙用，似乎遠在吹拍之上，講究立身處世者，不可不知。　踏也者，將其他人踏在脚底下之調也。假使因吹而四面已經曠朗，因拍而頂上已經空鬆，現在脚下再沒有所踏，你就可以巍然高起，惟我獨尊了。甚至更進一步，你確實忙着，未遑吹拍，那末，只要你會踏，用力的踏，你脚下踏得愈多，你的人也就可以扶搖直上，如方寸之木，高於岑樓起來。那時，你的同等地位者，固然望塵莫及，你的在上者，如果與你合作，你就連帶地頂他起來，否則乾脆地就曾給你頂翻，他的實座，你就可以「取而代之」了。</p>
<p>爲什麼這種善踏的聰明人，要稱爲善心的呢？沒有別的原故，因爲他看了一般無用的東西，不加利用，未免暴殄天物，有些可惜，於是他大發慈悲，來一一用作踏脚之物，化臭腐爲神奇，使他們各盡其力，各得其所，他簡直做了天大的好事，所以稱之爲善心的。</p>
<p>當今聰明人很多，而善心的聰明人尤其多所以人人都是大好老，而天下很是太平。至於蠢笨的人，當然還有，不能說沒有，可是少得很。他們沒有容身之處，是活該的，誰呌他們不懂得吹拍踏這三部曲呢！</p>
<p>蠢笨人簡直是世上的剩餘者，廢物。世上沒有了他們豈不更加地位寬宏，由得聰明人掉臂遊行，自得其樂。平心論之，聰明人是不應該給這些蠢笨人容身之處的，當然，運立錐之地也是不應該留給他們的。有些聰明人還肯給他們一個脚底下的地位，使他們足以容身，這樣的聰明人，謂非善心的而何！</p>
<p>聰明人說天地是寬大的，很不錯。不是他自己旣有容身之處，連蠢笨人也因他而有立錐之地麽！阿彌陀佛，聰明人旣聰明，又慈善，難得難得！</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>『陳鎭長是爲我們全鎭民衆，也是爲國家民族死去的，我們大家都該尊敬他。此外，在這次事變中死難同胞的壯烈事蹟，我也希望你們各盡所知的報吿上來。我相信目前最高領袖雖忙於布置軍事，但不久一定會下令搜集這些壯烈事蹟的，到那時我便可以彙報上去，請求褒揚和撫卹。』</p>
<p>葬禮舉行過了，於是便開始舉行紀念週，訓話。葉團長的容色更加嚴肅起來，他用非常沉着的聲音說：</p>
<p>『我們大家都要永遠記取這一次血的敎訓。敵人何以能够那樣快的攻下了合浦鎭，不外乎因爲我們還存在着重大的弱點，不能收到軍民合作的效果。而這弱點的造成，就要歸咎到過去我們一般民衆不把國家民族的利益爲前提，只知道自私自利，苟安旦夕。殊不知個人的利益和財產都寄託在國家民族上面，要是國家民族不保，個人的利益和財產怎麼能保得住？你們看楊岳梁這守財奴就是個好榜樣，他拚命把銀子窖藏起來，結果全被敵人奪去，自己不但不能享用，而且還送了性命，這樣的死法眞是不名譽極了！你們願意這樣不名譽地死嗎？（羣衆高呼：「不願意這樣死。」）</p>
<p>『所以從今以後，大家都要洗心革面，重新來做一個人，不論什麼都要以國家民族的利益爲前提。要知道個人的生命有限，國家民族的生命無窮，一個人生到世上來，倘若只顧自己過安樂的日子，實在是最沒出息的人，能够爲國家民族犧牲了自己的，纔是大英雄大豪傑。記得蔣委員長有兩句話說得好：「生活的目的在增進人類全體的生活，生命的意義在創造宇宙繼起的生命。」希望你們大家都能永遠記着這兩句話，努力爲抗戰服務，爲他人造福，不要專顧自己，這纔不枉生了一世。」（熱烈地鼓掌）</p>
<p>訓話完畢，便舉行升旗禮。廣塲中早已豎起了旗桿，在軍樂悠揚聲中，那一面靑天白日滿地紅國旗，開始慢慢的升到旗桿頂上去。葉團長領導羣衆，向國旗行了最敬禮，然後一致高呼：『中華民國萬歲！』『蔣委員長萬歲！』『抗戰勝利萬歲！』</p>
<p>在這高呼聲中，那一而鮮艷美麗的靑天白日滿地紅國旗，迎着曉風，獵獵的飛舞着，好像表示牠不願意僅僅佔領這合浦鎭的狹小的空間，而要飄揚到全中國的每個角落裏去。</p>

<h3>爲什麼拒收一元法幣？</h3>
<p>— 友聰</p>
<p>近來因爲市面上「一元法幣」很多，供過於求，所以金融市場上對於「一元法幣」有些時討厭。據二十六日申報所載，本市各銀行錢莊竟有拒收一元法幣的事。若是大宗款項,定要解繳款項的商家市民自行將一元鈔票掉成五元或十元收。這實在是一件違法的事，我們不忍不提出來嚕唕一下。</p>
<p>最先我們要說的是關於「法幣」二字的解釋，「法幣」二字在四五年前很少有人提及，自民國二十四年十一月四日我財政部頒佈「新貨幣法令」後，這才常常出現，一般自以爲摩登的仕女開口閉口終喊法幣，簡直當作「鈔票」的代名詞，而成爲一種時髦的口頭語了。這多少帶些曲解，現在我們要討論「一元法幣不得拒收的問題，便應根本從「法幣」兩宇講起。</p>
<p>一般人以爲法幣便是鈔票的意思，也有人以爲法幣與國幣同義，其實都錯了。原來法幣是一國底「本位貨幣」，它是有「無限法償」的資格，不像「輔幣」是只有「有限法償」的資格。所謂「無限法償」是說,凡國法無論怎樣一筆钜大的債務，若是債務人用「法幣」去清償，那麽債權人是絕對不得託故拒收的。但是只有「有限法償」的資格的「輔幣」可就不同了，它只能在國家法令限定的數量內有法償的資格，換句話說：若債務人全用「輔幣」來償還一筆钜大的債務（超過了國家法令限定的數量）那麽債權人是可以依法拒收，要求掉換法幣後才接受。所以各國有各國底法幣，各國有各國底關於「有限法償」的具體規定。我國在民國二十四年十一月四日財部未頒行新貨幣法令之前，銀幣便是「法幣」，毫洋便是「輔幣」。至於各銀行鈔栗不通是一種兌換券，更沒有無限法償的資格。後來我囝施行新貨幣政策，新貨幣法令正式頒佈，於是收白銀硬幣爲國有，以中中交農四行紙幣爲我國底法幣（按：中國農民銀行紙幣爲法幣是新貨幣法令頒行後從新規定的），換句聒說,除了這四行底紙幣之外，其他都沒有無限法償的資格，角票鎳幣自然是輔幣了。關於有限法償的具體規定，我國早有明令：「五角輔幣以二十元爲限，二角輔幣以五元爲限，一分及五分輔幣以一元爲限。」所以若是超過了這個限制，那麼收款者才可以拒絕接收,至於中中交農四行底一元五元及十元紙幣，旣政府明定爲「法幣」，那麽自然是「無限法償」的好貨幣。小至一元，大至萬千，莫不可以用「法幣」償還，任何人不得拒收。</p>
<p>可知從國家法令上說，一元法幣是絕對不能拒.收的。而且，我們也可以：從銀錢業本身上來說明。査上海市銀行業業規第四章第五條亦有明文規定道:「凡一切收解款項遵照財政部二十西年十一月四日部令槪用國幣。」又上海市錢業業規第四韋第五條亦有規定「凡一切收解款項遵照二十二年四月六日財政部部令通行國幣。」（按：錢業業規對於這條實應仿照銀行業業規訂正之）其實國幣已較法幣底範圍廣泛，便是說連輔幣也包括在內。所以現在本市有些銀行錢莊拒收一元法幣，旣是違反國家法令，也是不守同業業規了。</p>
<p>新貨幣法令之結尾道：「…所望全國人民，鹹體斯旨，一致遵行…如有故意阻撓，造謠生事…定卽執法嚴繩，不稍寬貨…」又中央銀行兌換券章程（民國十七年十一月國府公布）第八條說：「凡偽造中央銀行兌換券或破壊兌換券信用者均照法德處罪」</p>
<p>「爲什麽拒收一元法幣昵？」我要問。</p>

<h3>「影城記」雜談</h3>
<p>— 思敬</p>
<p>去年這時候，我們就聽見陳鏗然先生將以攝影場爲背景攝製一部電影，劇名也已經定「銀海浮雲」了，但是後來改拍了「女人」。現在的「影城記」，據說還是製取了「鈸海浮雲」的輸廊，不過內容全非了。就如現在「影城記」中的結尾和男主角的爭風，使女主角跳樓自殺；鏡頭拉開，卻是在拍戲，這最戲劇性的結束，幾乎是替「銀海浮雲」翻案的。</p>
<p>以「生意眼」講，英國電影中以攝影學爲背影的作品果然很多，很在國產電影中尙屬少見，而且美國電影和國產電影的觀眾，似奪有很明顯的分野，所以，像「影城記」這樣的作品，自然還有其「生意眼」的。狂風是怎樣製造的，大雨是如何落下的，雪花又是用什麽來代替的，看「影城記」的時候，我就聽見許多觀衆感到新奇，驚駭。而且褢面更有一個非常動人的三角戀愛故事：導演和男主角相爭一個女主角的愛情。果然，這褢或許含有諷刺的意味，如結尾鏡頭拉開時，是在拍戲，那位編劇者就說：「戲，根本就是戲！」但這諷刺的意味是非常軟弱的。它至多是暴露某些人的面目而已。</p>
<p>說到暴露，「影城記」中有一場戲是值一提的：女主角拍外景受傷之後，因為攝影場的工作不能停頓，導演用「提拔新人」這大題目說服了製片主任。自然，製片主任也自有他的理由的：「爲了號召起見，公司是不能任用一個沒有演戲經騐的人來充任主角的一。但是事實擺在眼前，死·住了幾位「舊人」，能不能有「號召」能力呢？相反的，許多新人的號召力又是如何呢？並且，我們不是健忘的話，報章上徵求某片主角的廣吿，不是強有力的證明嗎？所以，即使爲自身打算，也應該積極地訓練和提拔新人，這其實並不是一個「大題目」，歷史是殘酷的呵！</p>
<p>陳鏗然先生的導演手法是比較進步的，除了那個救難遊藝會拉得太長，（事實上對於這救難遊藝會也是穿插得非常突兀的，爲什麽不強調這場戲的原意，而僅僅把那樣冗長的表演去「滿足」觀衆呢？這正是「影城記」的自我諷刺篇。）他把全劇的情緒拉得很緊。</p>
<p>好些運用小聰明的戲也很自然。如：路明接到李英家裏來信哭的時候，文逸明以爲自己的嗜酒才使女兒傷心地摔去酒盃，及王乃東懷了槍去尋李英的時候，路明急著打電話去，而李英接著電話的是意位朋友請他吃飯等。最後的結尾自然是小聰明的尤者也。</p>
<p>路明和王乃東的戲都稱職。</p>

<p>第七回　乳燕新鶯影聯雙璧　越羅吳錦機織七襄</p>
<p>但是王女士不明白，不過一時之間，動於感情，似乎有些難捨難分。五歲的女孩子，一聽得自己的父母，要領她出院，要　開王女士，也是哭得一個不亦樂乎。因為自己生身的母親，·然也常來看她，究競一月不過來一兩次，那及王女士的親屬。到了臨出院的一天，那女孩子抱牢了王女士的腳，眼淚鼻涕，哭一個不休。王女士一面哄著她，一手撫著她的頭髮，也是眼淚似斷了線的珠子一般。看得許多人，都幫著她們也流淚了。後來那女孩子的父親說道：「旣然她們如此難於分別，我們再請院中留養一年吧。」聽說也不獨是王女士，別的保姆，和她撫育的孩子，不忍分離的，也是很多。總之一個孩子，和他的保姆分離，兩方面總要哭一場的。現在何家兩位小姐，看到有幾個育嬰室，都由保姆主持。有的已能走路的，有的尙在學步的，有的已能說話的，有的牙學語的，有的正在眠睡的，有的見人嘻笑的。這種育嬰室裏，只聽得孩子的笑聲，不聽得孩子的哭聲。還有兩個育嬰室，那都是未滿一年的，看護得特別周到。據說小兒的死亡率在各個年齡中最高，因此老章醫師是特別注意。至於比這再幼小的，生出在三個月以內的，那班嬰孩，卻是在婦孺醫院的育嬰室中保護的，暫時不送達育嬰院裏來咧。何家兩位小姐最後·到這一胎三兒的屋子裏來。原來這是一個特別室，這位保姆，就專管三位小寶貝。那位保姆姓康，單名是一個甯字，本來是婦孺醫院的一位看護女士，是老章醫師特別聘取的，因為她是細心耐勞，性情是非常柔和的。康甯女士也很為高興，這是很有榮譽的，人家問到撫育這三位小寶貝的是誰？就要舉出她來。可是寶任也比較別的那一位保姆似乎重一點。倘然這三個孩子中，有一個今天忽然有一些兒不舒服，就要急得那位康甯女士，沒有一刻工夫，心中得以安寧咧。幸虧這三個孩子，對她比了自己的媽媽還要馴服，一切都聽她的話，這使康甯女士的全副精神，都寄託早他們身上咧。（七四）</p>

<p>爲了中日戰事的延長，戰區的擴大，於是，各處來滬避難的難民，也就日見增加；同時，難童的數量，無疑的自然更要增加到一個巨大的數目了！因此，怎樣救濟這許多流浪在孤島上的難童？便成了一個値得注意的問題。</p>
<p>上海第八屆慶祝兒童節籌備委員會，因四四兒童節即將到來，故日來進行籌備工作，至爲緊張；該會除致函各大公司及商店，請求捐贈兒童節禮物，以便在兒童節那天，分贈各慈幼機關，及各收容所難童外，並致函遊藝界，請在兒童節那天，增加慶祝兒童節的節目，並免費招待各收容所的難童，入電影院覜映電影，使一般可憐的難童，能够得到精神的慰藉。這種舉動我們就救濟難童的立塲而論，覺得是有相當的意義和價値的。</p>
<p>不過，就筆者的愚見看來，遊藝界的救濟難童運動，還應該擴大而切實些。如果僅僅在兒童節那天，增加慶祝的節目，和優待雞童，免費觀映電影，那末，工作的成效，是不會偉大。我們希望整個的遊藝界，在四四兒童節那天，除了上述二項工作之外，再把正項收入，酌提十分之二三，來送交難童收容所，或慈幼機關，作爲救濟難童的經費，能够這樣，那末，在難童方面，眞是可以受到實際的恩惠了。</p>
<p>此外，如電影院的加映救濟難童的刺激標語，話劇界的穿插救濟難童的對白，播音台的加唱救濟難童的開篇，說書界的宜傳難實的苦况，……凡此種種，都能直接間接的激發一般人的同情心，對於難童的救濟上，無形中會增加偉大的力量的。</p>
<p>努力吧！遊藝界的救濟難童運動。</p>
<h3>醇酒廬劇話</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>昔　年北平三慶四喜兩大徽班。往往同一戲曲。而唱詞不同。嗣譚鑫培執歌壇之牛耳。於是三慶班脚本之勢力。始瀰漫南北。然四喜脚本之佳處。亦不可磨滅。老四喜班。前有張奎官王九齡。後有孫菊仙劉景然。其脚本與今之準備派。大半不同。張奎官長於本戲。如得意緣應大球均其中有名脚本。張奎官死後。本戲之總講。均歸劉景然。景然故後。不知流藩何處。惜哉。</p>
<p>遜淸同治光緖之間。有蓮花塘慶安瀾二本戲。編者爲何敬輿。敬輿因事入刑部監。監中無聊。以此消遣。戲詞多所寄託。感人殊深。當時稱爲佳構。愚居北平。遍求之。終未得一讀。</p>
<p>鑫培之戲。多宗三慶。然改革處極多。民國辛酉。王又宸出演於亦舞台。與愚過從甚密。其妻即鑫培之女。嘗謂愚言。鑫培親授又宸之戲。僅斷密澗一齣。其他皆又宸自己揣摩所得。故與鑫培。並不能完全相同。又言叔岩之戲。僅太平橋一齣。爲譚氏親援。其他皆學自王長林。故與鑫培亦有出入。時又宸正從張榮奎學珠簾寨。其妻不甚許可。因謂愚曰。昔日有個三大賢一折。原詞計五十六句。先父每吊嗓。必歌此折。耳濡旣深。故能記之。（原詞明日刋出）</p>
<p>同光之間。正中興之際。風氣古樸。伶人體健氣充。凡唱之戲。動輒百句。不尙巧腔。而氣韻如出天籟。聽者不厭其多。惟恐其少。近世風氣澆薄。人心浮動。專愛聽巧腔。如喜人之詔佞。而伶人什九困於鴉片女色。中氣本不充實。祗可以花腔取媚於人。而聽歌者。又復知識半庸欣賞能力較低之流。若輩腦滿腸肥。放浪驕逸。本不知音律爲何物。於是愈趨愈下。古音不復可聞矣</p>

<p>所以孔明思來想去，認爲這時滅曹的時機尙早，不如權且放他還京，一面自己先佔了荊州，取了長沙武陵，一步步的培養實力，拓展土地，一直到取了成都，入川之大計完全吿成，能有個進則可攻，退則可守的局勢啦，然後再計劃到伐曹這事。我們目看他於曹氏篡漢以後，征伐的那樣勤，（六出祁山，九伐中原，）前進的如此積極，就可知道他老光生已是毫無牛點顧忌啦。因爲他當初放曹的時候，就是希望曹氏去篡奪的，篡位的駡名，巳讓曹氏得了，同時漢家天下，也巳經亡了。這時孔明保着幼主，再從曹氏年裏把江山奪回來，先滅魏，後滅吳，爭拱而有天下，名正言順的扶保幼主登基，到這時誰能說他是篡奪而來的呢？往往人家說「借刀殺人，」而孔明的這一手可算是「借人試刀」歸啦句堆一句話「華容道繹曹，就是留他後日去篡漢，駡議曹家父子去捱，雖是一轉手的差別，而幼主的名分出處，可與曹氏大不相同，可惜天意歸晋，司馬氏近水樓台，先走了這步棋，竟使諸葛先生含恨九泉，這也算他徒勞心思了。」</p>
<p>十三姝考親年羹堯尊師</p>
<p>現在旦行裏演「十三妹」的多宗瑤卿一派，四大名旦中常以荀慧生之是劇，最擅勝塲，因爲他　於刀馬，復於京白唸得流利動聽，所以余莊瑤卿之後，要推他爲首選了。坤旦裏面我曾見雪艷琴演過　全本十三妹一，她的嗓音，本來甜潤，又有一種水音夾在裏頭，故而除了唸白的好聽之外，就　後邊祭靈時的大段唱腔，也都很有精彩的。這部「兒女英雄傳」的主要立意，也是在乎一個「孝」字，安龍媒因爲要救父難，才遠難鄕井，不顧途中危險，帶了二千銀兩，去營救他的天倫，以他一個從未出過門的懦弱醫生，敢毅然作此嘗試，這也可見他爲了一個「孝」字的驅使，就把一切的危難全不掛在心上了。</p>
<h3>播音圈裏的花花絮絮（二）</h3>
<p>— 筆花</p>
<p>後　來陳大悲忽然高興起來，也來嘗試播音工作。當然囉，陳大悲是話劇先進，加以文思又好，顧雷音那裏够得上他，當陳大悲跑上電台播送觀音戲之後，（是他在電台上別開生而獨得之名）果然，播送起來，大受聽衆歡迎，那時顧雷音幾乎給他打倒，以前歡喜聽顧雷音話劇的，都愛聽陳大悲的觀音戲了，經過短短的時期，那知陳大悲的觀音戲，竟會出人意料的失敗起來，終於不能維持而星散了。這其中却有兩種原因：一則因爲陳大悲的觀音戲的劇本太深刻了，難以普及，有資格的人果然愛聽，究竟無綫電的聽衆以娘娘小姐居其多數，還是聽聽「珍珠塔」「三笑姻緣」吧！二則他的播音代價太貴，不肯遷就。因此難以發展，曾幾何時，好像曇花一現的消聲匿跡了。</p>
<p>去了陳大悲的觀音戲，又來了李昌鑑的聞聲戲，性質好像陳大悲一樣，以一非話劇從業員的李昌鑑而能大膽地出來播送聞聲戲，眞使我替他揑一把冷汗。雖然，他也曾登過台，究竟他是客串性質，也可以說他是話劇票友，居然下海，而且不在舞台，而在電台，他的膽量眞不小。尤其難能可貴的，就是一個人而能飾幾種角色，又能說得各處方言，非常流利動聽，所謂不鳴則已，一鳴驚人。到如今他在播音界裏已經佔着相當地位，聞聲戲三字早已深深地印入聽衆們的腦海裏。他的劇本，大都是自已編的，雅俗共賞，頗能迎合婦女們的心理，這是他的長處，他會寫得一手好字，把自己所編的劇本印成本子，售給聽衆，同時贈送親筆所書的對聯。這樣一來，結緣不少，他的聰明之處，眞使我佩服。他也是我們故事播音研究會裏的會員。他很耐勞苦，不怕艱難，這是他的長處。</p>
<h3>「琵琶記」雙包案解決</h3>
<p>— 銀絲</p>
<p>國華「趙五娘」自動取銷</p>
<p>准定讓與新華獨家拍演</p>
<p>「琵琶記」係一著名崑劇，內容演述蔡伯喈夫婦離合事蹟，是一個宜揚舊禮敎的民間故事。全劇情節悽惋，且甚曲折。皮簧戲演此一劇，名爲「趙五娘」，亦復大體相同，一般無二。在不久以前，新華公司決定取爲劇材，把它改攝古裝影片；隨出陳大悲着手編劇，並經選定陳燕燕飾演主角趙五娘，準備在短時期內，就得動工開拍起來，那時國華公司方面適亦不約而同，也正有着這樣的攝片計劃。它們當在報上登出了『爲攝製「趙五娘」影片招請演員』的廣吿以後，不免引起新華訝異，形成了衝突的現象。因爲，「琵琶記」與「趙五娘」道樣不期然的趨上同一路綫，將來在營業方面是顯見同感不利的。新華起先策定辦法，擬將此片提前開拍，並即改爲華新公司出品，把它移歸新光戲院開映。藉此爭佔先着，免與國華「趙五娘」同隸金城戲院發生直接衝突。後來，國華方面終以同業情誼爲重，且悉新華「琵琶記」宜布較早，因向新華表示讓步，自動將「趙五娘」原定計劃根本放棄，准歸新華拍演。這才彼此歡然，告一解決。而銀幕上的趙五娘，因亦「只此一家，並無分出」，不會演出那樣雙包案式</p>

<h3>Chinese Troops Recapture Fengxin; Fierce Fighting Continues in Northeastern Wuning Mountain Area; Objective of Attrition Warfare Achieved, No Need to Defend Nanchang to the Death; Japanese Offensive South of Yueyang Suffers Major Setback, Casualties Exceed 2,000; Remnants of Japanese Troops Completely Eliminated on Three Sides of Xinyang Suburbs</h3>
<p>Xiushui: Japanese troops invading Wuning have suffered repeated heavy blows. On the morning of the 29th, Japanese troops launched a large-scale offensive. Chinese troops resisted heroically, fighting fiercely all day, killing countless Japanese troops. At this moment, fierce fighting continues with Japanese troops in the Zhanglinggong, Jiabainao, and Meiyanshan areas northeast of Wuning. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Gao'an: At 5 p.m. on the 29th, several hundred Japanese troops, accompanied by more than ten vehicles, stealthily invaded the vicinity of Xiangfu Temple (northeast of Gao'an). They were met with a head-on attack by Chinese troops, who killed many Japanese soldiers and destroyed one tank. The Japanese troops immediately fled in disarray. Japanese troops in Fengxin have suffered heavy casualties due to continuous attacks by Chinese troops in recent days. On the 29th, Chinese troops braved a hail of bullets to attack. The battle was extremely fierce. By the afternoon, the Japanese troops could not hold on and scattered in flight. Fengxin was thus declared recaptured. Liu Zheng is sweeping up the remaining Japanese troops. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, fighting on the Wuning front is continuing in the Wulishan area northeast of Wuning. Chinese troops in southern Henan have launched three offensives against Xinyang on the Pinghan Railway. Chinese artillery units are heavily shelling Japanese troops in the city. At the same time, it is reported that Japanese planes are bombing Chinese troops around Xinyang, and British-led Japanese troops are also rushing to Xinyang to reinforce. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Dongxiang: About one regiment of Japanese troops who crossed the Gan River from Shengmi Street continued to advance towards Gongjiadu (a station on the Zhegan Railway) southeast of Nanchang on the evening of the 28th. After being intercepted by Chinese troops, they are now facing each other in Shabutang (a station on the Zhegan Railway between Liantang and Liangjiadu). (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: On the afternoon of the 28th, more than a hundred Japanese cavalrymen, accompanied by three mountain guns, shelled Wucun (seven li north of Gaoyou City) more than ten times. Japanese troops in the Fengxin area are currently operating in two routes, one towards Gao'an and the other towards Xiushui. The strength of the Japanese troops in the Wugang area is about five regiments. A part of the Japanese troops at Zhuxi crossed south, seemingly to reinforce Jing'an. A certain Chinese division is still engaged in fierce fighting with Japanese troops in the Ma'anshan-Daqiaohe area. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission recently made a statement regarding the abandonment of Nanchang, saying that the Japanese have increased their troops in northern Jiangxi this time, making a final desperate effort. With a force of four divisions, they attacked Chinese Nanchang. After fierce resistance from Chinese troops, the Japanese suffered more than 15,000 casualties in ten days, and many high-ranking commanders could not escape. The Chinese side, having achieved the objective of attrition warfare, voluntarily abandoned Nanchang, which was only an empty city, on the 29th and made a planned transfer to a new position to prepare for a counteroffensive. From a purely military perspective, Nanchang has lost its value for a last-ditch defense. Furthermore, since Nanchang is no longer the seat of the Jiangxi provincial government in political terms, and all materials and people have long been evacuated according to plan, it has also lost its strategic position. Therefore, this abandonment of Nanchang is purely in accordance with the established consistent policy of protracted resistance and has no impact on the overall war situation, but only increases the difficulties for the Japanese and makes them more deeply mired in the quagmire. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changsha) Japanese troops at Xinkaitang and Matang in Yueyang have launched fierce attacks on Chinese troops for days since the reinforcements arrived on the 25th, but have been bravely repulsed by Chinese troops. During the Japanese offensive the day before yesterday, a part of the Chinese troops flanked them on the wings, and the battle was extremely fierce. The Japanese suffered more than 2,000 casualties and fled in panic towards Caijiatian. After this major defeat, the Japanese offensive was thwarted. Now, Chinese troops are taking advantage of the victory and advancing rapidly. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chinese military figures here declared last night that the highest authorities have instructed the troops on the Nanchang front to fight to the last man. At the same time, the new plan includes a large encirclement to cut off the Japanese retreat. Foreign observers believe that this new order indicates the determination of the Chinese military authorities to recover Nanchang. (30th Huitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: At dawn on the 24th, Chinese troops attacked Japanese troops at Xinkaitang and Matang. By noon, they had recaptured Qiguling (thirteen li south of Yueyang), killing hundreds of Japanese troops. Japanese troops in Yueyang are reinforcing that area. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Xiangyang: After the Japanese troops in Xinyang were fiercely attacked by Chinese troops yesterday, they suffered heavy casualties. This morning, Chinese troops completely eliminated the remnants of Japanese troops on the north, west, and south sides of the city and completely occupied all nearby strongholds, continuing to attack the city walls fiercely. Currently, Japanese troops and traitors in the city are tearing off their insignia and attempting to escape. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Changde: Huarong telephone report: (1) There are currently about 200 Japanese troops stationed at Bailuoji and Luoshan. Recently, they have ordered local residents to rush to build trenches. (2) Of the two Japanese warships originally anchored on the Chenglingji River, one withdrew downstream on the 29th. (30th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Fiercely Battle for Ten Days and Nights, Still Firmly Holding the Outer Perimeter of Wuning</h3>
<p>(Changsha) In this northern Jiangxi campaign, the defense of Wuning has been the most tragic and heroic. All defending troops have been able to display the highest degree of tenacity and a spirit of revenge. The Japanese troops began attacking Wuning on the 20th, with a force of about one and a half divisions, advancing along the Ruiwu Highway and the Ruoxi-Wuning section. They have been engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese defending troops for ten days and nights. The Japanese propaganda organs have admitted that two regimental commanders have been killed and two other senior unit commanders have been seriously injured. The casualties among the soldiers can be imagined. Chinese troops are using the hills on both sides of the highway to restrain the Japanese soldiers' advance. They engage in bayonet combat with the Japanese soldiers every meter, and only abandon after gaining satisfactory retribution. To date, the outer perimeter of the county seat is still in the hands of the Chinese troops. The city's south and west face the Xiu River. All Chinese officers and men are conducting a desperate bloody battle with the Japanese troops on the opposite bank of the Xiu River with the ambition to shake the mountains. The bravery and heroism of the Chinese troops in the past ten days have amazed and impressed even the Japanese officers. Yesterday, this station listened to a Japanese broadcast report about the setbacks they encountered in capturing Wuning and their praise of the Chinese troops. Only in the Songhu battle did they have such words for the Chinese Air Force martyr Yan Haiwen. This proves that the Chinese troops in Wuning are fighting to the death, making use of natural barriers, resisting fiercely, and launching counterattacks. They must fight to the last soldier and the last bullet for every high ground they occupy. Until the afternoon of the 25th, when Japanese artillery fire concentrated on Manshou Mountain and launched a fierce attack, the Chinese troops all retreated into the trenches and continued to return fire. Also, on the 24th, the Japanese Takagi unit seized the high ground west of Chen Village. At that time, a Chinese soldier was found in a trench, still resisting alone. When Japanese Lieutenant Matsumoto Katsutoshi approached him, the Chinese soldier suddenly rose up and stabbed fiercely, but eventually succumbed to the enemy and died calmly. The brave warrior was only a young man of about seventeen years old, a truly commendable and moving heroic feat. (30th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Eastern Hubei Recapture Wuxue</h3>
<p>(Hankou) According to sources from neutral parties here, the Chinese troops under Liao Lei, operating in the Dabie Mountains, recaptured Wuxue, an important town on the north bank of the Yangtze River, on the 27th of this month. After the Japanese troops transferred reinforcements from the south bank on the 28th, they launched a counterattack against the Chinese troops. Both sides are still engaged in fierce fighting. According to Japanese sources, Wang Dan, under Liao Lei's command, took advantage of the Japanese troops' attack on Nanchang on the 26th of this month and led two Chinese divisions south from the Dabie Mountains, attacking Wuxue in an attempt to threaten the Japanese transport lines on the Yangtze River. The Japanese Sugiyama unit is engaged in fierce fighting with them. (30th Express News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Invade Northern Jiangxi in Three Routes, Admitting Extremely Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Pingjiang: The bloody battle in the suburbs of Nanchang is still raging. The Japanese side admits that the losses in this battle</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On the Battle of Nanchang</h3>
<p>The Japanese troops entered Nanchang. The Japanese side has been spreading the news for a week, claiming that they entered the city on the 20th. Therefore, a week ago, not only were there many internationally who were gullible, but foreign newspapers also discussed the importance of its relationship. Even the people of Shanghai mostly suspected that it had already been lost. However, according to Chongqing dispatches, at 5 p.m. on the 28th, there was still a telephone line from Nanchang to Chongqing, saying that they were preparing for street fighting. From this, it is known that the fact of its fall is still only a matter of the most recent two days. Propaganda should be based on facts. If it is "to be the first to worry about the world's troubles and the last to enjoy its pleasures," it is a national aspiration that cannot be applied to propaganda. China has never hesitated to speak frankly about the gains, losses, advances, and retreats in war reports, and it has always been seen that it can adhere to this principle. The Nanchang incident is just one example of this. However, there are those who criticize the reporting as not being as fast as the Japanese. This is because they love the country and worry about the times and are suffering from hypersensitivity.</p>
<p>Nanchang is the capital of Jiangxi Province. After the August 13th Incident, this is the eighth provincial capital to fall. Since the withdrawal of Chinese troops from Wuhan, some have been mistaken in thinking that from Shanghai to Nanjing, to Anqing, to Jiujiang, and to Wuchang, the battle line has shifted entirely westward. In fact, Nanchang is still about 600 li southeast of Wuchang. There are also those who are mistaken in thinking that since Nanchang has fallen, Jiangxi is finished. In fact, the Japanese troops in Jiangxi only occupy a line from Jiujiang to Nanchang, which is estimated to be only one-quarter of the entire north-south length of Jiangxi. In the past, the communist wars in Jiangxi lasted five or six years, and the battle zone was entirely south of Nanchang, far beyond the area that the Japanese troops are treading today. It is also an area where the Japanese troops are pale in fear and retreat at the sight of it. From Jiujiang, going west along the river to Wuchang, and south to Nanchang, forming a right angle, this is the Japanese troops' two prongs in Jiangnan. However, the Jiuling Mountains and Mufu Mountains form a mountain range that runs from southwest to northeast, naturally forming an angle bisector for the right angle. Therefore, although the Japanese troops occupy the two points of Wuchang and Nanchang, they are separated by towering mountains and cannot form a military defensive horn.</p>
<p>The gains and losses of Nanchang have no military value to speak of. What is more noteworthy is that Nanchang is the end point of the Zhegan Railway, going east through Guixi, Guangxin, Yushan, and into Zhejiang Province, further east through Changshan, Quzhou, and to Jinhua, then north through Xiaoshan and to the south bank of the Qiantang River. There is also a railway to Ningbo and a highway to Wenzhou and Haimen. Therefore, the transportation between Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces will be threatened by the loss of Nanchang. After the withdrawal of Chinese troops from Beijing-Hangzhou, although there is no important military transport to speak of, the circulation of civilian passengers and goods is indeed the artery of the local economy. If the Japanese troops further invade eastward along the Zhegan Railway from Nanchang, the route will inevitably be used by them. However, the military value of Zhejiang Province is originally equal to zero. The decisive factor in this war is definitely not in Zhejiang. In other words, Japan's gain of Zhejiang will not help its final defeat, and China's loss of Zhejiang will not hinder its struggle for victory. Therefore, even if the Zhegan Railway is used by the Japanese troops, it is not a serious problem at first. Even from the perspective of the local economy, the living conditions in the interior have not yet progressed to the point of relying on railways. Having railways is convenient, and not having railways is simply a matter of making do. Moreover, foreign trade has already been controlled by the central government. There are very few Zhejiang and Jiangxi products that can be exported during wartime, and even fewer Zhejiang and Jiangxi lives that depend on imports. Therefore, there is no serious impact on the economy either. All of the above are inferences assuming that the Japanese troops control the Zhegan Railway. However, controlling this route requires a significant price, and whether the Japanese troops have the strength to pay this price is a fundamental question.</p>
<p>If the Japanese troops do not invade eastward along the Zhegan Railway but instead look westward into Hunan, this is another matter that is more noteworthy. Going west along the highway from Nanchang, through Linjiang, Yichun, and Pingxiang, one enters Hunan Province. From this road, going south of Changsha, on one side, the Japanese troops in Yueyang are eyeing the north of Changsha, which is a pincer attack on Changsha. And the reason why the Japanese troops took Nanchang this time, if it is not their last struggle before their defeat, is a circuitous strategy for attacking Hunan. We do not want to discuss the difficulty of their march in western Jiangxi or the fact that Hunan Province is prepared. However, as far as we know, China's war plan has long chosen Hunan as an area for annihilating the enemy.</p>
<p>The world regards the gains and losses of Nanchang as a major event after the Battle of Wuhan. In fact, it is just an ordinary point. It only attracts attention because it is a provincial capital. What we cannot help but say is that all parties, after rational consideration of the war situation, are able to understand the difference between a point and a line and a plane, and that the advance and retreat of a city or a pool has nothing to do with the overall situation, and that final victory lies in protracted resistance. However, those who express it from the instinct of intuition, every time they hear of a retreat, have a degree of worry, and what they look forward to day and night is only good news. Therefore, they are happy when they hear the sound of the guerrillas' guns, and they are happy when they hear the sound of the Chinese Air Force's planes. This is indeed commendable, but knowing that the time for a general counteroffensive has not yet come, and that the opportunity for final victory has not yet arrived, then whether it is joy or doubt, it can be said that these are emotions that should be restrained. War is a major event. What is important is the basic shaking of the other side and the destruction of the other side's main force. What one seeks in oneself is to gradually consume the enemy in order to hasten its shaking and destruction. Such as the current battle in northern Jiangxi, the Japanese side describes its intensity, saying that it is no different from the Battle of Luxembourg in the European War. Describing their encounters, they say that they have never had such a bitter fight since August 13th. We ask, although their statement has a rather self-satisfied meaning, the extent of the Japanese consumption and the courage of the Chinese resistance can be easily understood. Observing the people of Shanghai, there are many who lament the continued loss of Nanchang, but few who are comforted by the number of enemies killed and the amount of enemies consumed. It is as if the death and injury of thousands upon thousands of enemy regimental commanders and below is not as gratifying as a few Chinese Air Force planes flying over the Huangpu River for a performance. This is extremely thoughtless. Being compared to the Battle of Luxembourg in the European War is enough to show the ferocity of the heroic resistance of the Chinese troops encountered by the Japanese side and the magnitude of the losses suffered by the Japanese troops.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this month, the Japanese troops transferred a part of their forces from central Hubei to northern Jiangxi. The original units entrenched in northern Jiangxi also began to stir. The Japanese troops launched an offensive in three routes this time: the right wing from Wuning and Dengxi, the middle route from Qiujin, and the left wing from Yongxiu, crossing the Xiu River south. On the Wuning front, Chinese and Japanese troops are still engaged in fierce fighting in the northwestern suburbs of the city. A part of the Japanese troops attacking Wuning fled east to Zhuxi, crossing the river south to attack Dongkou and other places. The Japanese troops in this area were everywhere ambushed by Chinese troops at key points such as Huangpugang, Danojian, Jiabailao, Huijieshan, Wangrennao, Jinjishan, Fenghuangshan, and Dongkou, suffering extremely heavy casualties. Several dozen important Japanese officers, including regimental commanders Miyawaki Iwao and Ejima Torao, and battalion commander Takagi Tamaki, were all killed by Chinese troops, completing their unfortunate "silent triumph." The Chinese defending troops in this area resisted heroically, never retreating until their men and bullets were exhausted. Such heroic deeds can truly shock heaven and earth and move the gods. Even the brutal Japanese troops sincerely admire and revere them.</p>
<p>On the middle route, Japanese troops released a large amount of poison gas on the afternoon of the 21st to cover their units crossing the Xiu River from Qiujin and attacking Mantou Mountain. The Chinese troops gave them a head-on blow, and more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers below Japanese regimental commander Iino were almost completely annihilated. Later, the Japanese brigade continued to attack south to Wanjiafu, then west to An'yi and Jing'an, while another part fled south to Fengxin, crossing the Nanliao River to attack Gao'an. Fortunately, a fresh Chinese force arrived in an emergency, and the Japanese troops who fled to Gao'an were intercepted and contained, fleeing to Fengxin. A certain Chinese unit then launched a fierce counterattack, and the Japanese troops were almost completely defeated. Japanese commander Miyazaki and others were killed by Chinese troops in this battle. Fighting is still continuing in this area.</p>
<p>As for the Japanese troops on the left wing, they crossed the Xiu River from Yongxiu and fled south along the railway line to Lehua, reaching Niuhang, attempting to bypass the southwest suburbs of Nanchang by having a part of them go further south around Shengmi Street and forcibly cross the Gan River, launching a large-scale offensive. The Chinese defense forces in the suburbs of Nanchang, even at a time of extreme danger, did not lose heart, determined to live and die with the city, and continued to resist bravely. Until the afternoon of the 28th, the Chinese defense forces were still reporting the situation by telephone to the rear. And fighting until the 29th, most of the Japanese troops were still engaged in a major battle with the Chinese field army in the suburbs. Another small part of the Japanese troops had sneaked into the city from the south gate, engaging in fierce street fighting with the Chinese defending troops, with bayonets clashing and mountains shaking. It is reported that there were as many as three regiments of Japanese troops sneaking into Nanchang. (30th dispatch)</p>

<h3>US Credit Loan to China for 15 Million Gold Dollars for the Purchase of Aircraft Engines, Negotiations in Chongqing Reported Successful</h3>
<p>Hartford, USA: Negotiations for a US credit loan of US$15 million for China to purchase aircraft engines have been completed. According to news of this negotiation, it was first reported in Chongqing, presumably the location of the negotiation was in Chongqing. Therefore, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the United States expressed ignorance of the details.

<h3>Finance Ministry Spokesperson Declares Normal Repayment of British and French Loans Due, Other Debt Repayment Methods Under Negotiation with Creditors</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Finance Ministry spokesperson added an explanation today regarding Minister Kong's statement on March 26 regarding the disposal of debt secured by salt tax. The general idea is divided into three points: (1) Before the government and relevant parties complete negotiations, public bonds secured by salt tax should be handled in the same way as the method implemented for customs duty-secured public bonds on January 15. In other words, a portion of the debt secured by salt tax will be handled by the Central Bank in a separate special account. (2) The British and French loans due on April 5 will still be paid on schedule because the paying agencies had previously received funds allocated by the Finance Ministry, which are sufficient for debt payment. However, this can only be regarded as a special event. (3) The government is currently negotiating with the representatives of the creditors, striving to find a suitable and practical method under the current situation to maintain creditworthiness.

<h3>Belligerent Nation Nearing Its End, Future Diplomatic Trends, Plans to Adjust Relations with Britain, America and France, Arita Invites Envoys from the Three Countries for Talks</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It is heard that Foreign Minister Arita has invited British Ambassador Craigie, French Ambassador Henry, and American Ambassador Grew to his official residence on the 31st of this month to discuss a certain diplomatic matter. However, the specific details remain unknown. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) People here are paying close attention to the meeting between Prime Minister Hiranuma and former Prime Minister Konoe on Wednesday. It is said that the two exchanged opinions on Japanese domestic policies related to the recent situation in Europe and various domestic issues. Hiranuma and Konoe will meet again on April 1st. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) A Tokyo dispatch states that after the closing of the Japanese Diet, Hiranuma has begun his political work, and his future actions are particularly noteworthy. On the 29th, Hiranuma met with domestic journalists and expressed numerous opinions on current domestic and foreign issues. Hiranuma first stated, "The basic principles of Japan's diplomatic national policy were meticulously decided by the previous cabinet and have not changed to this day. However, the specific plans for implementing these basic principles must be altered to adapt to changes in the international situation. This is a difficult issue to explain in detail. It is difficult to make people understand without providing concrete examples. Once examples are refused, it is difficult to initiate discussions." Hiranuma also stated, "Japan does not belong to the totalitarian bloc, nor does it belong to the democratic nations' front." When a reporter asked about the Soviet fisheries issue, Hiranuma replied, "There is no reason to be optimistic, but I am not pessimistic either." Another reporter asked about the future of the Anti-Comintern Pact and whether Japan needed to issue a statement. Hiranuma only stated, "There may be a need to issue a statement in the future." Hiranuma acknowledged that there are various difficulties in adjusting diplomatic relations with Britain, the United States, and France, but because there is a demand for adjustment, the difficulties must be overcome. However, he did not specify how to adjust. Regarding foreign exchange policy, Hiranuma stated that the rate of one shilling and two pence must be maintained. Regarding the future of the war against China, Hiranuma stated, "The basic policy towards China was decided by the previous cabinet, and the current cabinet will continue to implement it. There is no intention to issue a statement, nor is there a need to convene an Imperial Conference or a joint meeting of the Great Headquarters and the Cabinet." Regarding domestic issues, Hiranuma stated, "Japan must realize the necessity of preventing and expanding industrial production, but this cannot be achieved without implementing resource mobilization." This seems to imply that depending on the needs of the environment, it may be necessary to implement the National General Mobilization Law article by article. Finally, Hiranuma stated, "The two positions of Minister of Communications and Minister of Colonial Affairs in the cabinet are currently held concurrently. People will be selected to fill these positions soon, but this is not a reorganization." Konoe will serve as a minister without portfolio. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Oshima, Goes to Italy, Related to Strengthening Anti-Comintern Pact</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Oshima, has departed for Italy with his secretary, Furuichi. It is said to be a private tour. Informed sources here believe that the Japanese ambassador's trip is related to the Anti-Comintern Pact plan, as Prime Minister Hiranuma had already foreshadowed this last night. Oshima and Furuichi played an important role in the negotiations before Japan strengthened the Anti-Comintern Pact. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Finances, Stretched Thin, Chinese Guerilla Tactics Are Exquisite, Sufficient to Inflict Significant Damage on the Enemy</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, New York, March: At the current dinner of the Foreign Relations Association, Professor [blank] Eldon, a lecturer in Japanese history at Columbia University, gave a speech on the financial and economic situation of Japan. He mainly stated that although Japanese finances are stretched thin, they have not reached the point of collapse. Some people have predicted that Japan's national debt would reach 100 trillion yen, which would be unsustainable. In fact, it has already exceeded this amount and has reached 100 trillion yen. However, the Japanese government issues public bonds to cover various expenditures, most of which are absorbed by national banks, amounting to about 300 million yen per month. The savings of its citizens increased to 300 million yen last year, indicating that the point of financial collapse is still some distance away. From an economic perspective, Japan's trade surplus with the "countries" of the Great East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere last year was as high as 60 million yen, but the total foreign trade was a deficit, amounting to as much as 492,000,000 yen. Hanson, a reporter for the United Press, who had gone to the Chinese mainland to observe and interview, and had spent some time with the guerilla units, also spoke at the meeting, briefly discussing guerilla tactics. He stated that the areas occupied by the Japanese army are limited to the transportation lines. Outside of this narrow area, they cannot effectively control the military, political, and economic aspects. Although military experts say that guerilla forces cannot achieve a lasting victory, in reality, guerilla tactics often pose a serious threat to the enemy's morale, which is the main factor in victory. Some commentators say that the Chinese are not good at warfare, while others say that the peaceful Chinese farmers have transformed into valiant warriors. It is unknown which of these two views is correct. This is the most elusive aspect of the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union and US Expand Navies, Japan Reveals Unease</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Navy Ministry spokesperson Kanazawa replied to questions from a certain foreign journalist today, stating that some Soviet submarines may have been built in Vladivostok, but most were clearly built within the Soviet Union in Europe, disassembled and transported to Vladivostok by train or ship, and then assembled in Vladivostok. It is heard that Soviet submarines bound for Vladivostok have been discovered outside of Singapore, but the number that have sailed from the sea to the Far East must be very small. Soviet submarines are divided into two types: one is 1,200 tons, and the other is 600 tons. When a certain foreign reporter inquired about the United States' preparation for two 45,000-ton battleships, Kanazawa replied that Japan gives full consideration to the naval situation of the world, especially the major naval powers, when formulating its naval policy. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to news from here today, the two 45,000-ton battleships that the United States plans to build this year will surpass other warships in terms of power, speed, and range. The ships will be equipped with twelve 16-inch guns. Previously, 39,000-ton battleships had only nine 16-inch guns. The speed will be 30 nautical miles per hour. The distance that can be traveled on a single load of fuel is unknown. The length of the ship is 880 feet, and the beam is 108 feet. The cost is 95 million US dollars per ship. In addition, the Navy also plans to build a large fleet of 3,000-ton small ships. (30th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>US-China Legislation, Amendment Issues, Deeply Concerned About Being Unfavorable to China, Senators Adopt a Cautious Attitude</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, government officials and members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hope that the committee can pass the "Cash and Carry" clause in Senator Pittman's Neutrality Act within two weeks. Some government officials and senators believe that the clause is unfavorable to China because China does not have ships to transport military supplies, while Japan does. Therefore, they are adopting an extremely cautious attitude regarding whether to approve the clause. Other senators believe that the clause is the only effective way to deal with the current situation in Europe. They believe that European powers friendly to China can transport military supplies from the United States through the Suez Canal to Burma, and then transport them overland to China. The Japanese blockade of the Chinese coast has made it impossible for the United States to directly transport military supplies to China. The government is very hopeful that the bill can be passed as soon as possible, but some senators will vigorously oppose the bill because they still have differing opinions.

<h3>France Truly Augments, Vietnam Defenses, Aircraft Factory Nearing Completion</h3>
<p>(Paris) Colonial Minister Mandel informed the Colonial Committee of the Chamber of Deputies today that the government has taken appropriate measures to augment the defenses of various colonies, especially Vietnam and Somaliland.

The government is also building a large-scale aircraft factory there to manufacture aircraft locally, which will be completed soon. (29th Havas)</p>
<h3>British House of Lords Passes Bill Approved by King, Exchange Equalisation Account Bill Established, British MPs Concerned About Interests in China, Hong Kong Emergency Security Law Prompts Questions</h3>
<p>(London) The House of Lords today passed the bill guaranteeing a loan of 5 million pounds sterling to China to充法幣 Exchange Equalisation Account. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) At today's meeting of the British House of Commons, concern for China did not diminish due to the tension in Europe. Members continued to raise various questions regarding British interests in China. Under-Secretary of State Butler replied to a certain question, stating that the Japanese government has paid the British government 20,000 yuan in Chinese currency as compensation for the loss of life caused by the Japanese air raid on Shenzhen when bombs fell on British territory. Members also asked Butler to state the current status of Inner Mongolia. Butler then listed the situation of the Mengjiang United Committee and the small autonomous governments of Chahar and Northern Shanxi, and stated that Japanese troops are stationed in various places along the Ping-Sui Railway, but the British government has not received accurate information on their exact number. Labour MP Sorensen asked the government to pay attention to the Hong Kong Emergency Security Ordinance, which authorizes local authorities to arrest and deport people who are "obviously without legitimate employment," and suggested that such cases should be handled by the courts to avoid unfair situations. Dominions Secretary Inskip replied that such security ordinances are justified when an emergency situation exists and there is no risk of unfairness. Sorensen insisted on his question, and said that any arbitrary and unfair actions would be bad publicity for the Hong Kong government. Inskip replied that the Hong Kong government must take special actions to deal with tens of thousands of refugees in special circumstances. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Poland Firmly States, Will Not Abandon Danzig, Nor is Willing to Join the Anti-Comintern Pact, Anti-German Sentiment is High Among the People</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Polish Senator Colonel Miedziński declared at the meeting yesterday, "Poland will never agree to return Danzig to Germany or build a highway in the Polish Corridor. At the same time, it is unwilling to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. If any party makes any one or several of the above three demands to Poland, then Poland's answer is only a firm 'No.'" (30th Huitong Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Although Polish officials have denied rumors that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop held talks with Polish Ambassador Lipski on the Danzig Free City issue last Sunday, reliable sources confirm that this is indeed the case. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is said to have proposed to Ambassador Lipski that negotiations be conducted on the following three issues: (1) the sovereignty of the Danzig Free City; (2) Germany's construction of a highway through the Polish Corridor to East Prussia; and (3) Poland's attitude towards the Berlin-Rome Axis. The ambassador then rushed back to Warsaw to report this proposal to Foreign Minister Beck. The Polish government has not yet provided an answer, but the country's military authorities have augmented the size of the army and issued national defense bonds to strengthen the air force and improve air defense matters. The significance of this should not be underestimated. (30th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Anti-German sentiment in Poland has recently increased even more. Newspapers are using extremely agitated tones regarding the issues of Upper and Western Silesia. Polish radicals have poured into German public places, demanding that everyone immediately stop speaking German, which immediately led to clashes. Tables and chairs flew everywhere, and as a result, a German man, Minde, was seriously injured. (30th Huitong Dispatch)</p>

He is expected to arrive in London that evening and visit British Foreign Secretary Halifax for lunch on the 4th, and meet with Prime Minister Chamberlain in the afternoon. (30th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Mercantile Bank, Business Report, Affected by Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>(London) The Financial Times reported that events in China and India forced Mercantile Bank Chairman Willis to use slightly more cautious language when reporting on business conditions at the annual meeting, but there is a reason for this. Judging from the bank's profit and loss statement, one might get the impression of business losses, but after Willis explained, it was known that the truth was the opposite. The business was not in deficit. According to Willis, the decrease in the bank's current accounts was due to the fluctuation of the true value of the Chinese legal tender. The overall decrease in the bank's deposits was technically due to the low exchange rate of the Chinese currency. As far as the bank's experience is concerned, it has never been inferior to HSBC. A Times of London editor claimed that in the shadows of Cheng's detailed description of the current situation in China, there is a torch of light. The editor was referring to China's efforts to build an economic system in the western provinces and re-establish the broken lives of millions of merchants, workers, and artisans who moved west from the Yangtze River basin in areas with hidden resources that have not yet been developed.

<h3>British Territorial Army Personnel, Placed on a Wartime Basis, Will Increase to 32 Divisions, 340,000 Men, Prime Minister Chamberlain Announced Yesterday in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons today that the Territorial Army will be placed on a wartime basis and will be doubled, so that thirty-two divisions can serve overseas. These thirty-two divisions will replace the nine divisions announced by War Secretary Hore-Belisha three weeks ago. The Prime Minister also stated that this measure is the first result of the new international situation prompting him to re-examine all aspects of national life. In carrying out this review, the government deeply felt that there was still a need to continue to utilize the spirit of voluntary service shown by the entire country, especially thinking that those who wish to join the Territorial Army must not be rejected because the troops they wish to join have exceeded the prescribed strength. Therefore, the 130,000 men of the Territorial Army on a peacetime basis will be raised to a wartime basis, with the number set to increase by about 40,000 men. The Territorial Army on a wartime basis will be twice as large as before, with a total of 340,000 men. The Prime Minister also mentioned the need to maintain this increased force due to the increased potential for war. Liberal Party leader Sinclair raised a supplementary question about the establishment of a Ministry of Supply. The Prime Minister replied that the government has not yet had the opportunity to consider whether it needs to revise its views on this issue after the increase in the strength of the national defense forces, but it will give it full consideration. The Prime Minister also confirmed the statement made by Labour Party leader MP Greenwood, that the government's proposal proves that the government believes that the possibilities of what voluntary service can achieve have not been exhausted. Greenwood continued, saying that this can indicate that the government has the ability to meet all the needs of the country. The Prime Minister also admitted, when questioned by a certain MP, that the issue of compulsory national service in Britain was discussed with French Foreign Minister Bonnet last week, but he declined to comment on the progress of the talks. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Warning to Aggressor Nations, Britain and France Respond in Concert</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Times stated that after Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech, Britain and France responded simultaneously. The Axis governments cannot but pay attention to these two countries' responses. French Prime Minister Daladier gave a radio address according to his scheduled time, and the words of the British Prime Minister suddenly came. Chamberlain's announcement of doubling the strength of the British Territorial Army undoubtedly warns Italy not to resort to force in order to achieve its plans in the Mediterranean region, which have not yet been clearly announced. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, all the newspapers here published the news of British Prime Minister Chamberlain's announcement that the Territorial Army will be strengthened by doubling, with large headlines. It explains this development as a middle ground, on the one hand it can meet France's expectations for British conscription, and on the other hand it can avoid causing the well-known British aversion to compulsory military service. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to a certain diplomatic observer, the two major events today are Prime Minister Chamberlain's announcement of increasing the Territorial Army to 340,000 men, and Prime Minister Daladier's radio speech that he would not allow the cession of an inch of French territory or abandon any of France's rights. The observer praised Daladier's speech, saying that it expressed a willingness to test any suggestions from Italy, and pointed out that after Britain increased the Territorial Army, it would have 26 Territorial Army divisions in addition to the six divisions of regular troops overseas, and would have a powerful army to intervene in Europe if necessary. According to information obtained by Reuters, the British conscription authorities are confident that they will have sufficient recruits to reach the new quota for the Territorial Army. It is heard that there are many regular army officers who can fill command positions, and there are also thousands of soldiers who have completed their military service who can rejoin to fill junior officer positions. British political figures welcomed Daladier's speech, believing that its wording was harmonious, but expressed that they could not compromise on important points, and believed that the solution to this matter was not hopeless, given Daladier's speech and Italy's unpretentious wishes. Diplomatic circles here believe that the important action in European politics thereafter will be the visit of Polish Foreign Minister Beck to London next week, and said that Germany has been working hard on propaganda, aiming to persuade Beck to cancel this trip. The most obvious thing is that many of the publicity materials for this campaign are only given to foreign reporters in Berlin and not published in German newspapers. Poland is obviously prepared to respond in the same way to Germany's campaign. From the news published in Polish newspapers today, it can be seen that the government and the mouthpieces of the opposition parties have now formed a solid front to resist German attacks, solemnly declaring that while Polish policy has not changed in the slightest, Germany has abandoned its "Greater Germanism" and adopted a policy of European imperialism, which will definitely lead to a bad reaction from Poland.

<h3>British Cabinet Members Lobby the Soviet Union, Differences of Opinion Have Been Dissolved</h3>
<p>Danzig: The "Danziger Zeitung" published an editorial today, commenting on British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson's visit to Poland and the Soviet Union. The newspaper stated that Hudson has already failed in Poland, and after arriving in Moscow, he lobbied the Soviet Union to join the anti-German front. The Soviet Union proposed exchange conditions, saying that Britain must adopt an attacking attitude towards Japan. According to the official Soviet Russian communique, after Hudson's visit to Moscow, some differences of opinion between Britain and the Soviet Union have been dissolved. (30th Huitong Dispatch)</p>
<h3>London and Paris Public Opinion, Express Unanimous Welcome</h3>
<p>(London) This morning, all the newspapers here published Prime Minister Chamberlain's announcement on the strength of the Territorial Army and Prime Minister Daladier's broadcast speech in extremely prominent positions. Except for the Daily Mail, which did not agree with the government still adhering to the volunteer military service system and advocated changing to a compulsory military service system, all the newspapers welcomed the speeches of the prime ministers of Britain and France. The Times stated that the welcome of the Prime Minister's announcement is a true expression of British volunteerism. The Daily Telegraph said that the people of the country heard the Prime Minister's words with joy, and there is no more welcome and timely step than this. The newspapers all praised France's solemn and firm position, and hoped that aggressor nations would pay attention to Prime Minister Daladier's warning. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers of all parties in France unanimously agreed with Prime Minister Daladier's remarks. Le Petit Parisien stated that Daladier's remarks were not only powerful but also clearly stated that France does not harbor hatred for anyone. The entire population agrees with the words used by Daladier, because they are words suitable for reason and not words of provocation and anger. France does not reject negotiations aimed at studying legitimate and honest rights claims, and will never recognize that others can force France to accept their wishes. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Righteous Virtue Counters Annihilation</h3>
<p>(Rome) Mussolini's spokesman, Gaida, recently commented in the Italian newspaper on the speech delivered yesterday by French Prime Minister Daladier, stating that France has absolutely no room for concessions regarding our country's demands. This has been confirmed by Prime Minister Daladier. "The door for negotiations between France and Italy was originally half open and half closed, but the French side clearly intends to close it. Our country should record this and wait for developments." However, Prime Minister Mussolini said that there is still a wide gap between France and Italy that cannot be filled. Prime Minister Daladier said that Italian residents within Tunisia have not been mistreated, which shows that "the French government is unwilling to discuss territorial issues or rights issues, and its intention is to alienate our country and stubbornly adhere to its own views. Under these circumstances, the dispute between France and Italy will inevitably become more serious, and we should start doing other things, but not forget this dispute," he said. (30th Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(Rome) The initial impression in Italy of French Prime Minister Daladier's speech last night is, in short, that Italy deeply feels that France has not taken responsibility for developing peaceful relations between France and Italy. Officials believe that opinions can only be made public after the full text of the speech arrives here. However, Italian political figures have stated that France clearly intends to ignore Italy's natural demands. It is generally pointed out here that Italy's demands on France are based on Italy's recent historical developments and do not violate the Treaty of London in 1915. In short, Daladier's failure to pay attention to these facts constitutes an attempt to attack Italian fascism, it is said. (30th Reuter's News Agency)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After French Prime Minister Daladier delivered his speech yesterday, German political figures have remained mostly silent, only stating that Italy should express its views first. Most newspapers have published brief excerpts without printing the full text of the speech. The local Guidance Newspaper reported that Prime Minister Daladier refused to make concessions to Italy and showed no understanding towards foreign countries. The Hamburg Foreign Review reported that Prime Minister Daladier was very willing to start negotiations with Italy, but insisted that the negotiations should be based on the Franco-Italian agreement of 1935, it is said.

<h3>French Prime Minister Reiterates Determination to Safeguard Territory; Willing to Open Negotiations with Italy Based on Agreement; Willing to Fight to Defend Freedom</h3>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Daladier delivered a broadcast speech this evening. The first part explained the goals of French policy and the strength of the nation. The second part criticized totalitarian countries. The third part explained the relationship between France and Italy. The fourth part explained the relationship between France and Germany. The conclusion was a call for all peace-loving countries in the world to cooperate with each other. The full text of the speech is excerpted below:</p>
<p>National Unity to Face the Crisis</p>
<p>The Prime Minister began by saying that, at present, countries are wary of their neighbors and are actively replenishing their military equipment. All kinds of normal activities have been destroyed as a result. The instability of the international situation can be said to have reached its peak. One might ask, "What does France desire in this situation?" I will answer that France desires to maintain peace among free people. One might also ask, "Where does France's strength lie?" I will answer that when France faces a crisis, it can unite spiritually and materially. This is where its strength lies. One might also ask, "What kind of determination does France hold?" I will answer that France is determined to safeguard its ideals and rights. In short, the unity, firmness, and strength of France today are unprecedented. Because France abhors war, it deeply hopes that peace can be preserved. However, if it is forced to choose between fighting and humiliation, it will not hesitate to rise up and defend freedom.</p>
<p>Great Strength, Not Afraid of Tyranny</p>
<p>As for France's strength, the factors that constitute it are numerous. To list the most important ones, there are several: (1) The financial economy has been improving daily. (2) The vast colonial empire with African territories as its center is very powerful. I personally visited North Africa and deeply know that its people are loyal to the motherland. (3) The spiritual and moral values ​​possessed by the French nation are also the source of national power, such as respecting individual rights, tolerating various opinions, and the automatic unity of the entire nation in maintaining truth and justice under the condition of maintaining a free order. All of these are virtues of the French people. (4) The army is powerful, and the whole country participated enthusiastically when the government previously decided to take various measures in the military. This is especially gratifying. (5) The friendship France maintains with various countries is also a major source of its strength.</p>
<p>Strong Criticism of Totalitarian Countries</p>
<p>At this point, Prime Minister Daladier turned to criticizing the new methods adopted by certain countries, saying, "These countries equate enslaving the people with freedom and destroying civilization with progress. Their authorities claim to be working for the welfare of mankind, but only make mankind bankrupt. In France, it is the opposite. Everyone can choose their way of life and freely believe in what they want to believe without being enslaved. Because we believe in this principle, we never believe that everything between countries should be based on force. For the French, international relations should be based on justice and law. Force should not be used until justice and law no longer exist."</p>
<p>Accusation of Italy Unilaterally Abolishing Treaty</p>
<p>Regarding the relationship between France and Italy, the agreement signed by both sides on January 7, 1935, has effectively resolved all issues, and France has fulfilled all its obligations. However, on December 17 of last year, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano suddenly sent a note to our government, stating that the country no longer considered this agreement to be valid. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini said in a speech on the 26th of this month that all of the country's demands had been explained in detail in this note, and specifically mentioned the issues of Tunisia, Suez, and Djibouti. Outsiders, unaware of the situation, mistakenly believed that the country's government had received a formal notice and had not yet submitted a reply.</p>
<p>Arguments Held are Difficult to Accept</p>
<p>In order to dispel doubts, the government has decided to publish the exchanges between the two sides. "I must announce to the world that the note submitted by Italy did not list any demands, nor did it involve the issues of Zurich, Djibouti, and Tunisia. It only stated that the country had obtained new rights after conquering Abyssinia, and that the Franco-Italian agreement of 1935 was no longer considered valid. Of course, we cannot accept this kind of argument. If Italy's claim is true, then every time a place is conquered, new rights will arise, and the country will inevitably make other demands, one after another, without end. But France will never give up an inch of its land, nor will it give up the slightest bit of its rights. This is especially reiterated here." However, the French government is still prepared to faithfully implement the spirit and words of the Franco-Italian agreement of 1935 on the basis that I have explained. France is willing to consider any suggestions that Italy puts forward on this basis. As for the current situation in the protectorate of Tunisia, it is said that 94,000 Italian residents have been mistreated. In fact, Italian residents and their children have always enjoyed the most liberal treatment, not only in Tunisia, but also in the French mainland. The facts are there and do not need to be restated.</p>
<p>No Adjustment to German Relations</p>
<p>Regarding the relationship between France and Germany, the government has made many efforts in the past to reach an understanding with Germany, such as the signing of the Munich Agreement and the publication of the Franco-German "Non-Aggression Declaration." A French economic delegation went to Berlin to negotiate a trade agreement, but Germany's conquest of Czechoslovakia and occupation of Prague have dealt a great blow to our country's efforts. In the past few years, some people have often cited the right of national self-determination as a justification for certain actions. Later, some people spoke of natural aspirations. Today, some people are promoting the room for survival. What they are saying is just a synonym for continuing conquests.</p>
<p>Appeal to All Countries to Strengthen Cooperation</p>
<p>At a time when the whole world is at risk of war, I, in the name of France, appeal to all peace-loving countries to cooperate with each other. All countries that share our feelings and are prepared to rise up and resist future aggressors must unite. This appeal, I believe, will have an impact throughout Europe and even across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Regarding the relationship between Britain and France, the two sides have the same views and have decided to work hard using the same methods and the same goals. It is hoped that all rational people in the world (all countries, without distinction, are not lacking in rational people) can listen to this rational call," he said. (29th Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3>French Government Publishes Documents of Exchange Between France and Italy; Proving that Italy's Cancellation of the Treaty Lacks Sufficient Reason</h3>
<p>(Paris) The note submitted by the Italian government for cancelling the Franco-Italian agreement of 1935 and the reply submitted by France have recently been published by the government.</p>
<p>The Italian note was delivered by the Italian Foreign Minister Ciano to the French Ambassador Ponsot on December 17 of last year. The main points are as follows: (1) Article 7 of the Franco-Italian agreement stipulates that this agreement shall take effect as soon as both parties exchange ratification documents, but the exchange procedure has not yet been implemented. (2) Article 1 of the Franco-Italian agreement stipulates that both parties shall establish a special treaty on the Tunisia issue so that it will take effect at the same time as this agreement. Negotiations have not been conducted on this point. It can be seen that the agreement signed by France and Italy to adjust their interests in North Africa has not yet been completed. (3) The Franco-Italian agreement was based on several definite conditions, and these conditions have not yet been confirmed. (4) The Franco-Italian agreement focuses on developing friendship between the two sides and laying a foundation for sincere cooperation. The Italian government is willing to sacrifice the rights enjoyed by Italian residents in Tunisia and the rights stipulated in Article 13 of the Treaty of London in 1915. It is originally hoped that France can understand the country's demand to expand its power in East Africa. Later, when Italy was forced to resolve its relationship with Abyssinia, France failed to show understanding, and even after the fact, its attitude was contrary to Italy's expectations, which is regrettable. In short, the Franco-Italian agreement has not yet been implemented. Your ambassador must have noticed it when he met with me on December 2. It is not appropriate to consider it valid. Since the implementation of sanctions against Italy by various countries, the situation has changed rapidly, and the Franco-Italian agreement is of course no longer applicable. In addition, since Italy established an empire, it has acquired several important new rights and interests, and the relationship between France and Italy cannot be based on the 1935 agreement. In order to enhance mutual relations between the two governments, it is necessary to re-discuss it, it is said.</p>
<p>The French reply was issued on December 25 of last year, stating that the Franco-Italian agreement has been ratified by the French Parliament. The reason why the ratification documents have not been exchanged is that the special treaty on the Tunisia issue could not be declared established in advance. However, the establishment of this special treaty was the voluntary decision of the Italian government, and the blame does not lie with France. On the contrary, France has transferred 2,500 shares of the Djibouti Port to Addis Ababa Railway Company to Italy, which shows that the Franco-Italian agreement has indeed begun to be implemented, and Italy is enjoying its benefits. Later, negotiations were conducted several times, until April 22, 1938, when French chargé d'affaires Blanc-Tailleur met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. The Italian side always admitted that this agreement had indeed been established, and the French side did not have any expression that could provide Italy with an excuse to change its attitude. In addition, it initiated the recognition of the Italian Empire in Geneva on May 12, 1918, in order to realize it. Furthermore, on October 12 of that year, Ponsot was appointed as ambassador to present his credentials to the King of Italy and Emperor of Abyssinia. It has been benevolent and righteous. As for France's attitude during the Italo-Ethiopian War, it had to be so because it had international obligations. Former French Prime Minister Laval had explained it to Prime Minister Mussolini. In short, France's actions had a moderating power. On the one hand, it had to be willing to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the League of Nations covenant, and on the other hand, it made every effort to maintain friendship between France and Italy. This was also recognized by Prime Minister Mussolini and has been repeatedly praised by him, it is said. (29th Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3>American Sympathy</h3>
<p>(Washington) The speech delivered yesterday by French Prime Minister Daladier has been warmly welcomed by American political figures, who praised "France's calm self-esteem and its moderate but firm attitude." All of this can be seen in it. Daladier's words are clear, which is the opposite of the violent rhetoric of the dictators. The State Department said that France's position on Italy's demands should be strongly supported. Prime Minister Daladier's statement that "every time a place is conquered, new rights will come with it, which is difficult to recognize" is especially sympathetic to the United States. The key turning point in France's attitude lies in this. This is consistent with the fundamental views of the United States. In short, the wish of most of mankind is to restore the principles of international law and establish a moral order, which all parties are willing to maintain. If a certain country wants to replace it with violence one day, then a fair solution will not be established one day, it is said. (30th Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3>Germany, Italy, and Spain Will Hold a Tripartite Conference; News Regarding Italian Prime Minister's Whereabouts Seems to Have Been Verified</h3>
<p>It was reported from the Italian harbor that Mussolini arrived at this harbor today, and that the Italian Prime Minister is now going to Sicily to attend a round table conference. The report that he will discuss the Spanish issue with German Aviation Minister Goering and General Franco seems to have been verified. Mussolini, accompanied by Fascist Party Secretary Starace, arrived safely at the Calabria Hotel here this morning. When Mussolini's train arrived at Paola Station, 15,000 people paid their respects to him and shouted "Long live the Spanish National Army!" "Long live Mussolini!" Mussolini only stayed in Paola for a few minutes and exchanged greetings with the welcomers and local authorities before continuing his journey to Taormina, where he got off the train.

<h3>Italian Reservists Called Up for Service; 250,000 People</h3>

<h3>The Fall of Madrid is Not the Fault of the War; Britain and France Actually Connived at Aggression; The Crime of the Traitor is Unforgivable</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Pravda newspaper commented on the fact that the traitor Miaya and Casado sold Madrid to the rebel army, saying, "The fall of Madrid was not due to the defeat of the Republican army, but because it was sold out and assassinated. The Spanish Republic, which has no weapons or food and is under strict blockade, has resisted foreign fascist armies for nearly three years. Its ability to do so is entirely due to the great unity of the people who hate fascist oppression. The London organizers of the Madrid counter-revolutionary coup added fuel to the fire of the fascist intervention army, resulting in the fall of Madrid. Their attempt was to trade with the fascist aggressors at the cost of the red blood and suffering of the Spanish people. However, although British and French diplomats have consistently connived at the aggressors, the result is still a failure. London is now greatly alarmed, and Colonel Casado, the direct culprit of the Madrid rebellion, has fled. The progressive people of the world deeply hate this kind of traitor and his gang."</p>
<h3>German Women are Surplus, Thanks to the War</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Berlin is now urgently needing to solve the "women's problem" like major capitals around the world. The most difficult thing here is that there are too many women. The German authorities are now trying to equalize the number of men and women here, but all kinds of methods have failed. According to statistics published by the local municipal authorities, the number of women in excess has more than doubled before the war. Because in recent years, boys have been five or six percent more than girls in the production of children throughout Germany, but as a result, the number of women is still more than the number of men. Officials believe that during the European War, a large number of men died in battle or were transferred to other places to engage in military service, so the number of women is higher than that of men in comparison, it is said.

<h3>Chinese Air Force Displays Power in South China; Sinking Japanese Warships and Destroying Oil Depots; Guangdong Refugees Often Eat Tree Bark and Fruit to Fill Their Stomachs</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: In the Sino-Japanese war in South China, there have been no major battles between the two sides recently. However, the Chinese army takes advantage of the favorable weather and terrain. Although the troops have not yet taken the initiative to attack, they first send planes to fiercely bomb the Japanese army's positions, places where military supplies are stored, or air force bases. Over time, the Chinese Air Force has suddenly become active. In particular, the bombing of the Japanese oil depot on Sanzao Island, which belongs to Zhongshan, on the morning of the 17th of this month is the most memorable. Sanzao Island is very close to Zhongshan and Aodou. The Japanese army occupied the island as an air force base for attacking Guangdong before invading Guangzhou. After more than a year of operation, aircraft warehouses and roads around the island were built. In addition, armories and oil depots were built in remote areas. Recently, the above-mentioned institutions were detected by the Chinese Air Force. Suddenly, 28 bombers were sent on that morning, divided into several teams. Half of them were fighter planes, ready to deal with Japanese planes, while the bombers aimed at the military key points in the island from an altitude of 8,000 feet.</p>
<p>More than Ten Bombs Were Dropped. The Japanese planes on the island were caught off guard and could not take off. There was no way to fight back. When the ammunition exploded, the island's oil depot, granary, and military supply depot were all hit. For a time, flames shot into the sky, and the losses were numerous. At about 9 a.m. on the 20th of this month, 31 new-style light bombers and single-wing fighter planes of the Chinese Air Force were found in the airspace near Nansha Island, which belongs to Zhongshan County. About ten Japanese warships are usually gathered there, including one or two transport ships and about thirty motorboats, all of which are prepared for landing. The anchorage area is quite large, and Chinese planes dropped more than ten bombs at the gathering place of Japanese warships and boats. A Japanese gunboat was destroyed on the spot.</p>
<p>It Sank Immediately. Only the masts and smokestacks were exposed on the water. More than ten Japanese motorboats were also sunk. The Japanese navy's losses in that area were even greater than the previous time. In the evening, after the Chinese Air Force made the Japanese army feel terrified, it flew to Humen, the exit of the Japanese army to the sea, in the dim moonlight to investigate, hovering for about ten minutes. The Japanese army there fired more than ten anti-aircraft guns, but they were aimless. After the Chinese planes learned the truth, they launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army camp at the Shajiao Fort and the Japanese warships on the river. After the investigation, a shell hit the Shajiao artillery position, and four or five Japanese warships on the river were injured. The Chinese planes accomplished their mission and took advantage of the night to continue flying to Taiban Village near Conghua County. They detected that the newly built defensive works and the increased construction in Zengjiangxi near Lychee were all</p>
<p>Completely Destroyed. The Chinese planes safely withdrew. At this time, the spring rain is continuous and the war is still in a stalemate. The poor, old, weak, and unarmed people in the war zone are all suffering unspeakably. The price of rice in various counties near Guangzhou is one-fifth higher than last month. Usually, one yuan (Cantonese currency) can still buy seven pounds of rice, but now it can only buy four pounds. Recently, after Daliang, Shunde County, was occupied by the Japanese army, the price of rice in Chencun and Bijiang rose even higher. One yuan can only buy three pounds of rice. Because the Japanese army in Daliang has recently been besieged by guerrillas, the land and water transportation in dozens of nearby villages has been cut off. Refugees are now using taro and sweet potatoes as food, or even tree roots and fruit peels to fill their hunger. Therefore, taro, sweet potatoes, and the like are also worth more than two corners per pound. As for Chaozhou and Shantou in Dongjiang, the price of rice has not yet fallen.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Digging Jiang's Treasure Beside the Wangjiang Tower in Chengdu; Discovering Human Heads and Stone Carvings and Other Items</h3>
<p>Chengdu Aviation News: The news that Zhang Xianzhong's sunken silver was being dug out from the Jinjiang River beside the Wangjiang Tower has caused a sensation throughout the city since the news was disclosed in various newspapers. Everyone on the streets and alleys, teahouses, and restaurants is talking about Zhang Xianzhong's actions in Sichuan 300 years ago. This unusual miracle, if silver can really be found, is indeed a more rare world wonder than the American "Five Blessings Coming to the Door." Therefore, the reporter gathered several colleagues yesterday morning, taking a half-believing attitude, and went to Shiniu Yan near the Wangjiang Tower to investigate whether this Jiang Treasure Digging for Silver incident was real or not. The crowds were endless along the way. Passing by the Yinshi Tower and the Zhenliu Bank, it was already full of men and women who were driven by curiosity.</p>
<p>The Zhangjia Living Buddha Was Also Among the People, and the fellow lamas were talking about right and wrong. A small sand island appeared in the dry river. There were dozens of prisoners with cloth signs on their backs working hard on the excavation work. The Jiang River branched out from the island and circled east. There were more than a dozen military police guarding the surrounding area, refusing entry to maintain order. There were also tents for the workers to live in. Two waterwheels were draining water from the excavated area to the outer river. After being allowed by the soldiers to take a small boat to the island, the design team leader, fortunately, belonged to the highest level, and instructed that there was a trench that had been excavated, which was about two zhang deep, and no abnormalities were found. Then, the strategy was changed, and another excavation was started across the river, and only five feet away</p>
<p>Four Human Heads Were Discovered. The university students from Sichuan University were then taken to the chemistry lab for testing. Then, dozens of red sandstone pieces, each four feet long and one and a half feet wide, were found with the characters "Zhang," "Tian," "Si," "Xia," and "Wang" on both ends, as well as Zhang Xianzhong's symbols for killing people. Below was tung oil ash stone and dead wood strips. The general opinion is that treasures or ancient tombs will be discovered in the future. According to relevant sources, the Jiang Treasure Event is briefly described in Chen Shao Xiang Lian Shu's Que Bilu, which recorded that after Zhang Xianzhong was defeated by Yang Zhan in Jiangkou, he decided to go to northern Sichuan and transfer the remaining gold and silver, cakes, and treasures of the Shu government to the Jiang Mian River, dig several levels of holes under it, cover it with wood and stone, kill all the pan workers, and then open the embankment and release water so that people could not find it. Now, the excavation of the Jiang Treasure has discovered the above-mentioned signs. If there are any new discoveries, the excavation will be intensified. This Jinjiang River Taotao Company was established by Ma Kunshan and others after years of Yang Bailu's 27 years of observation, transmission, and textual research, and was approved by the Executive Yuan and ordered by the Ministry of Finance to be transferred to the provincial government to order Ma et al. to handle it. If silver is indeed discovered in the future (the amount is of course unknown), it will be divided into 80% for the public and 20% for the company to handle relief work.</p>
<h3>The People of Pinghu Mourn the Martyrs Who Attacked the City</h3>
<p>More Than 4,000 People Cried in Unison</p>
<p>Pinghu Correspondence: On January 20 and February 5, the Chinese army was ordered to attack Pinghu County twice. The martyrs Lu Xiehe, Yao Renrong, Song Fenyu, Zhou Xiusheng, Zhong Shaoyu, Yu Laohu, and others bravely fought for glory and risked attacking the city. Unfortunately, they died in the line of duty. The party, government, and military of Pinghu County and the people from all walks of life, considering the heroic sacrifice of Lu Martyrs and others, which is worth singing and weeping about, specially held a memorial meeting at the public sports field in Xincang Town a few days ago. More than 4,000 people attended. The county magistrate presided over the ceremony, offered wreaths, and reported the brief history of each martyr. The listeners were all moved. As for the family of the martyr, only Lu Xiehe's widow, who was about twenty years old, was present. When she bowed and spoke to the attendees, her eyes were red and swollen, and it is imaginable how deeply saddened she was. After the funeral was over, the original plan was to sing the memorial song and shout slogans. The onlookers gathered, and the road was blocked.</p>
<h3>The New Fourth Army's Year of Anti-Japanese War: Experiences and Lessons - Xiang Ying (4)</h3>
<p>Changes in the Battle Situation in Jiangnan and its Development Trends</p>
<p>First, changes in the enemy's situation can be discussed from two aspects: one is military changes, and the other is political changes.</p>
<p>A. Military changes can also be divided into two stages: First, the situation in the Jiangnan war zone before June. Before June, the enemy's military was centered on Nanjing, with Wuhu and Zhenjiang as strongholds, two strategic base points, and two strategic forward positions. The enemy's forces were concentrated in these three strongholds, but the strength of each stronghold was not large. On the traffic lines of Nanjing-Shanghai, Nanjing-Wuhu, Nanjing-Hangzhou, national highways, and county towns or large towns on both sides of the traffic lines, only a small number of troops were stationed to maintain their transportation. Before June, the enemy's traffic could proceed smoothly without any severe attacks or obstacles. The enemy could control and rule everything with a small number of troops, and even three to five men could go to the nearby villages on both sides of the traffic line to rape and plunder, rarely being attacked. This means that before June, the enemy's rear traffic was very safe. The total strength of the three traffic strongholds was no more than three regiments. From Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Dangtu to Jiaohu, only two or more regiments were stationed regularly. Other strongholds had only a platoon or a squad of men. Precisely because the rear traffic was very safe, the enemy could transfer most of its forces to the northern war zone, concentrating on Huainan, Jinpu area, to attack Hefei and Xuzhou. This was the situation before June. But since our army entered the war zone, due to our active offensive and continuous attacks, the enemy's traffic has been frequently stagnant and obstructed, feeling threatened. In order to protect military strongholds and strategic hubs, the enemy had to counterattack us. At present, the enemy's troop deployment is different from before. Second, the current military deployment of the enemy. Currently, the enemy's forces are scattered and concentrated in two areas, one centered on Nanjing and the other based in Wuhu. The enemy's traffic lines can be said to be that all traffic arteries on the Nanjing-Shanghai line, every bridge, station, and corner of the road, have built strongholds and are stationed with troops. Needless to say, each stronghold concentrates considerable forces to guard it, and every small place has been constructed with fortifications as cover. We are shuttling back and forth between the enemy's strongholds. Now the enemy's movement or movement must be protected by force, and lightly few people dare to go down to the countryside. In total, there are two and a half to three divisions of the enemy in Jiangnan, one division centered on Wuhu, one division centered on Nanjing, and one brigade centered on Zhenjiang. In addition, more than 5,000 puppet troops from North China and Manchuria have been added. The enemy's deployment is more rigorous. This is a major change in the enemy's military deployment, and this is the result of our arrival in the Jiangnan area.</p>
<p>B. Political trends. The enemy's political trends can also be divided into three periods. The first period is before June. 1. The Japanese army's burning, killing, and raping in the Jiangnan area are widespread phenomena, using power to suppress the Chinese people and make them submit. 2. The guerrillas have very bad discipline. The Japanese use this phenomenon to incite the people's feelings against the guerrillas. They say that the guerrillas are disrupting peace and order, and the Imperial Army is fighting the guerrillas. These facts have been used to confuse the Chinese people and have achieved considerable results. 3. The use of double-dealers to establish its rule. The double-dealers are: when the Japanese army comes, they set off firecrackers to welcome them and get some women to comfort the Imperial Army; when the Chinese army comes, they also set off firecrackers. These double-dealers preside over everything, with no mutual violation with the Japanese invaders, attempting to survive in peace. 4. The guerrillas and the Japanese invaders have tacit understanding and do not fight each other. This phenomenon was very common in Jiangnan in the past, and it still exists in the eastern section of Nanjing and Shanghai. 5. Japan took advantage of the fact that after the Chinese army withdrew from Nanjing, no army remained in Jiangnan to fight, so there was no propaganda work. Japan could carry out arbitrary propaganda in China and use traitors to announce the news of the Japanese invaders' combat. This naturally depressed the anti-Japanese sentiment of the people in Jiangnan. This is Japan's first phase of political action (to be continued)</p>
<h3>Eight Traitors Executed by Firing Squad, Zhou Yuelou's Late-Life Disloyalty</h3>
<p>Taixian Newsletter: Zhou Yuelou, an 83-year-old man from Shungangzhou Township, Zhenjiang County, was recently suspected of being a traitor and was executed by firing squad by the Chinese military to serve as a stern warning. Xinghua Newsletter: The traitors captured by various agencies in Xinghua, after being interrogated by the county government and admitting the facts, were reported to the provincial government for legal execution. Yesterday, instructions were received that Li Kekuan, Xie Jiuyu, Wang Xiaodai, and Lin Deguang, as well as Tian Yusheng, Bao Desheng, and Gan Junzhi, who were held in custody by the Eighty-Ninth Army, should be executed by firing squad. After receiving the order, the county government verified the identity of the criminals, tied them up, and sent them to Shengdang for execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Chiang Orders Jiangsu Provincial Government to Prevent Yellow River Flooding</h3>
<p>Dianhua Newsletter: The Jiangsu Provincial Government received an order from Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission, stating that the breach in the Yellow River cannot be closed for the time being. In the future, the water势 flooding will cause serious loss of life. The provincial government should immediately instruct the counties in the flood-affected areas to contact and handle the following matters before the Taofan this year: ① The flood scope and major embankments this year should be repaired, raised, and thickened as much as possible, so that the river channel can pass through the old trough and avoid increasing flooding. ② If the previous item is difficult to handle, then weirs should be built near each village to accommodate all the people of the village temporarily to avoid water and to store surplus grain. The height should be properly planned by the province according to the terrain and water勢, so that it will not be submerged during high water levels. ③ The existing water in the lower reaches should be drained. ④ Before gathering laborers for construction, the county government should teach workers to common sense of air defense. The above methods should also be notified to the counties and villages that have already fallen into enemy hands, so that they can pay attention to them together.</p>
<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education to Add a Department of Vocational Education; Provinces and Cities to Establish Vocational Education Sections; Counties to Establish Vocational Education Committees</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Newsletter) Vocational education is particularly important in the current process of resisting Japan and building the country. The Ministry of Education attaches great importance to vocational education, but there is no special department to be in charge of it. In the past, it belonged to the Department of General Education. Education expert Jiang Wenyu believed that the country's entire education includes only three items: national education, talent education, and vocational education. The importance of vocational education can be seen. It seems appropriate to set up a special department to be responsible for promotion. He specifically suggested that the Ministry of Education add a Department of Vocational Education, provincial and municipal education bureaus set up vocational education sections, and counties set up vocational education committees to specialize in the matter, so as to assist in the war of resistance and national construction. The Ministry of Education also expressed its deep approval of this. The director of the Department of General Education is now jointly discussing the organizational regulations with the counselors. Once the draft is completed, it will be submitted to the evening meeting. After approval, it will be formally established.</p>
<h3>Hunan Province Plans to Establish the First United Middle School, Combining Seven Provincial Middle Schools and Five Attached Elementary Schools</h3>

Zhu Jingnong was appointed as the chairman of the preparatory committee, Xiong Mengfei as the vice chairman, and Wu Huihua, Xiong Chongxu, Yang Guochu, Zhou Shengtang, and other principals of the provincial schools as members of the committee. School sites have been found in Anhua and Jialu cities. The area is located in the upper reaches of the Lian River, bordering the remaining veins of Hengshan Mountain. The environment is secluded and convenient for transportation from Changsha, Xiangtan, Yuanling, and other places. The junior high school normal school attached elementary school and other departments are located within three miles of Qiaotou City. The senior high school department is located in Qixing Street, twenty miles away from the city. The branch of the senior industrial department was originally located in Yongfeng, Xiangtan, and will be moved again if necessary. The junior vocational department is located in Lizhai, three miles away from the city. The administrative organization includes seven middle schools and five attached elementary schools. The faculty and staff are selected and hired from the original schools. The number of students in senior high school model junior high school boys and girls is estimated to be more than 1,800, which is merged from 40 classes into 30 classes. The branch of the senior industrial junior vocational school has about 600 students, and the attached elementary school students total more than 4,000, which is unprecedented in the education field of Hunan. Enrollment procedures have begun, and the monthly expenses amount to 12,000 gold. In order to plan for emergencies, the provincial government has been specially requested to issue self-defense rifles, and a squad of well-trained students will be selected and compiled by military instructors to serve as guards.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhihui's Lecture: Educational Issues in the Eyes of a Layman (4) Strict Management is the Only Way to Avoid Failure; In Times of National Crisis, Frugality Must be Exemplified</h3>
<p>What's the danger of teaching too much advanced theory? Because too much advanced theory is very useful for the first aspect of good, and people who are good at the second point will definitely know that it is natural, but they may not know why, and there may be little to help him implement it. Therefore, if the work is too busy, it is better to meet Yan Yuan, a disciple of Confucius who does not reach benevolence in March, and occasionally talk about it. In addition, it is also quite necessary to save energy and be a Confucius who rarely speaks about life and benevolence. If you talk too much to people below the average of 65, it will not only be a waste of effort, but also create danger. The best result is the insight of Gao Hanlin in "The Scholars", who believes that having been hungry and having been drowned is just a matter of education in the class book, and there is no need to implement it. Because Mr. Ji is in charge of improving farmland, how can one starving person in the world be counted as him starving him? Mr. Yu is in charge of water conservancy projects, how can one drowning person in the world be counted as him drowning him? Isn't the theory too high? Although Gao Hanlin's position is a Hanlin, his personality is probably below the average, so he naturally doesn't understand it. However, he copied this topic from the education section and wrote it in the eight-legged essay, and the Hanlin was deceived by him. This is just a small danger. There is also a group of big politicians who recite slogans fluently, with national interests and people's happiness on their lips. Sometimes you find out that they are unreliable and feel very annoying, and you are wasting your time in vain. However, when you are in need, you listen to him saying that it is like a real price. If you are not careful, even a position higher than the Hanlin will be deceived by him. It is difficult to get a Shao Zhengmao, and Confucius painfully executed him. I am afraid there are still many small Shao Zhengmaos, and Confucius also feels that it is impossible to execute them all, so he only talks about nature and the way of heaven, which cannot be heard every day. Pay attention to your words, so as not to be stolen by this group of people and add capital for them to do evil in higher grades. As for having to say something so that, it is better to enrich it with culture and restrain it with ritual. Restraint has two meanings: one is to restrain and raise the ritual in the enrichment of culture, and the other is to restrain Dong'er and tell him not to move improperly or speak improperly. It is also necessary to manage him in education. Is it not safe to manage it? Confucius could not say anything about management to the Asian sage Yan Yuan, so now what kind of movement is too polite. It is better to change the movement to management for the matters that must be done in this way and must not be done in that way, which will be much more effective.</p>
<p>Add a management character to the education character of education to make the education character effective. Moreover, management requires more effort than education, which is also a natural trend. For example, when we set up officials, there is only one Ministry of Education in charge of education, while the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Civil Service, and the Ministry of Audit, which are in charge of management, require four. Speaking of this, the teaching and management are roughly explained. I think that the raising and connection things of the nurturing character, although it is inevitable to be regarded as physical, the effort is worth spending a lot, it seems that it is more important than management and teaching, because the nurturing and defense are not sufficient, the management and teaching will definitely be reduced, even if a person's ability is not sufficient, the spirit will inevitably be greatly affected, so it can also be compared to the setting up of officials, for management and teaching, it is the five departments of education internal affairs justice civil service audit, for the three departments of nurturing art, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy, and the Ministry of Military Administration, although only three departments are set up, is the cost spent not more than the five departments? However, this childish comparison is unavoidable laughable, but if I spend half of my effort to make you all noisy for three hours, I am afraid you will have to pay great attention to it. It is a pity that you have spent your noble time for nearly an hour and a half now. How can you make it for another three hours? It is better to talk about it when there is a chance.</p>
<p>There are only a few summary words. In our past education, there was education but no nurturing, so we ate a big education in this war of resistance. We also did not pay attention to the management character, and secretly changed the national education into religious education. Although there are people on the surface, it has created many literati, but how many can be generals and ministers, analyze Wei Zunzu, and most of them are monks chanting scriptures. Therefore, there is still a layman named Niu Tongzheng, who said to me in February last year that he was afraid that the characters in our school were no different from the lamas in the Mongolian temple, and only became a higher class in society. It is no different for us to send our children to school than for Mongolia to have three sons and want two to be lamas. I was very amused by his metaphor. That day, I ran to the Confucius Pond and heard the sound of reading inside a primary school. I thought that this was the group of little lamas again. Just as a teacher came out, he recognized me and wanted to invite me in to give a lecture. I was holding this bizarre idea, what could I say when I went in? I politely declined and said goodbye. We laymen have this kind of feeling. You all listen to it, smile bitterly, and scold us. Let you all deal with it. (End)</p>

<h3>Chief Chen Responds to Chu Minyi, Agreeing that Chinese Martial Arts Should Participate in the World Games; Preparation, Training, and Selection Work Will Be Prepared in Chongqing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai</h3>
<p>The 12th World Games will be held in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, next year. Chu Minyi previously suggested to the Ministry of Education to send a Chinese martial arts troupe to the meeting for performance. He sent a nurturing telegram to the Minister of Education, Dai Jitao, Wang Rutang, etc., roughly meaning that the Chinese Sports Association held a meeting in Chongqing, and our country has decided to participate in the World Games. Mr. Wang Rutang was publicly elected as the general team leader, and at least two teams of football and basketball went to the meeting. It seems that Chinese martial arts should not be neglected. Recalling the results of our country's participation in the Berlin World Games last time, all kinds of competitions fell behind. Fortunately, there was a performance of Chinese martial arts, which was welcomed by foreigners and won a lot of glory. This session should pay special attention to it, and the scope of organization and athletes should be expanded compared with the last session, and the quality should be more refined. Preparations should be started immediately, and true talents should be selected in Chongqing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai at the same time, in order to obtain international honors. Now I know that Chu has received a reply from Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education, expressing his deep approval of the suggestions, and has transferred the letter to the preparatory committee for the 12th World Games for reference. It is also heard that Chu will actively engage in the preparation, training, and selection work based on his long-cherished ambition to promote Chinese martial arts.</p>

<h3>West League Football C Group Champion Undecided, A Group Donghua Runner-up, Yesterday's Meeting Decided</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Western Football Association held an executive committee meeting at its clubhouse on Nanjing Road at 5 pm yesterday to discuss closing matters. Many executives attended. As a result of the meeting, the champions of the cup competition have been determined and there is nothing to discuss. However, in terms of the league, neither group A nor group C has been able to complete all the matches, so the champion has not been produced. After discussion, the champion of Group A was decided to be calculated according to the first cycle, so the championship belongs to the Four Fords. According to this calculation, Donghua is in the group with 10 points, ranking second, and West Bu is in third place with 9 points. French merchants have one less game and are followed by 8 points and Kex. The bottom is Zhen Dan.

<h3>Finance: Cash Prices Turn from Falling to Rising</h3>
<p>Changes Remain Small</p>
<p>Only Seven Yuan Fluctuations</p>
<p>Yesterday's Shanghai Gold Market conditions were slightly more volatile than the previous day. The situation was initially weak, then turned firm, entirely dependent on buying and selling. Initially, the situation was weak due to selling by gold shops and silver houses. Later, due to successive purchases by securities firms and money exchange businesses, and the slight tightening of foreign exchange at the time, confidence gradually improved, and prices gradually firmed up, closing at the highest price of the day, 2082 yuan. As a result, prices rebounded by five yuan. However, trading remained sluggish, with only over 300 taels transacted throughout the day. Silver shop jewelry prices remained at the original levels, while customs gold remained stable. Chinese and English pure gold, etc., rose slightly.</p>
<p>Shanghai Gold Market Up Five Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each ten taels opened with scarce supply and demand, leading to no trading for a long time. It was not until after 10 o'clock that a certain silver shop sold 50 taels to a gold shop at an opening price of 2077 yuan, with no change compared to the previous day's afternoon close. It was rumored that money exchange businesses traded 50 taels mutually at 75 yuan and 5 jiao. Later, a silver shop sold 20 taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 75 yuan. Before long, a securities firm and a money exchange business suddenly competed to buy on behalf of customers, so the market stopped weakening and stabilized. The securities firm bought 90 taels from the gold shop at a price of 77 yuan. Following this, a certain money exchange business also bought 50 taels from the gold shop at the same price. After this, the money exchange business still wanted to buy, but the gold shop's willingness to sell weakened, so supply and demand reached a standoff again. At 11:15, a money exchange business bought 50 taels from another money exchange business at 80 yuan, acting as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, supply and demand became clear again. Only the silver shop bought 50 taels from the gold shop at a price of 82 yuan. Later, there were buyers but no sellers at the opening price, making it difficult to trade. Therefore, the evening close was still 2082 yuan. As a result, prices rebounded by five yuan compared to the previous day's noon close. The selling price of cash shop's own brand gold was 2090 yuan, and the purchase price was 2075 yuan. The current bid gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was no trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Still Unchanged</p>
<p>The exchange price of silver shop jewelry per tael has not changed, as the Shanghai gold market has been stable. Datongxing still lists 211 yuan, and Xintongxing lists 209 yuan, with a purchase price of 203 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Up Half a Penny</p>
<p>London, 29th - Due to the recent weakening of the British pound, the price of English pure gold has also increased by half a penny per ounce, reaching £7 8s 6d. As a result, the central bank's current purchase price of Chinese gold has also increased to 1212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed price of customs gold has not changed, remaining at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard bid gold price has also increased by 4 jiao, reaching 1207 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<p>Mixed Changes in Foreign Currencies</p>
<p>Yesterday, English pure gold rose by half a penny, and the English-American exchange rate fell by 125. In the local foreign exchange market, settlements by foreign firms were strong. Fortunately, Hong Kong telegraphs and foreign banks provided supplies, maintaining market stability. However, due to the decline in the English-American exchange rate, the result was that English was stable and American was tight. The Shanghai gold market opened weakly, but after days of decline, confidence improved, and retail investors took advantage of the low prices to buy, boosting the weak market. However, actual transactions still felt sluggish, and market prices continued to be stable. Foreign currencies such as English and American gold pounds had slight sales, while English and American gold bills were in high demand. Foreign banks continued to buy, and the supply was still smooth. The rise and fall of each currency were mixed. Trading by the association was not strong. Changtai sold and Xiangkang bought 40 pounds of English gold bills. Hongchang sold and Xiangkang bought 30 pounds of English gold bills. Dongtai sold and Tongfeng bought 500 yuan of American gold bills. Yesterday's market prices: French gold bills fell by 1 fen, American gold bills rose by 3 li, Hong Kong bills fell by 5 li, French franc bills fell by 2 hao and 5 fen, ruble bills rose by 5 li, Canadian bills rose by 3 fen, Philippine bills rose by 1 fen, German gold bills rose by 1 jiao, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>

<p>Shanghai Exchange: 104 yuan, 25</p>
<p>(Shanghai Exchange is the amount that Tianjin should receive for 100 Shanghai dollars)</p>
<h3>Rumors of Hong Kong Dollar Devaluation; Hong Kong Exchange Selling Spree; Sudden Increase in Demand for American Exchange</h3>
<p>The exchange market yesterday saw increased settlements by major foreign firms, and foreign banks (excluding HSBC) also saw more inflows than outflows. In addition, Hong Kong telegraphs also stopped selling, so the English gold once tightened to a settlement price of only eight pence and 21875 for foreign firms. Later, relying on HSBC's maintenance, it stabilized. The American exchange, due to the trend of English-American exchange rates, had been weakening for two days, so foreign banks were reluctant to sell, resulting in a slight tightening of 0.03125. Trading was quite active throughout the day. The Hong Kong exchange was initially slightly soft due to foreign firms' settlements. Afterwards, Reuters suddenly reported that the Hong Kong currency would be devalued, so selling soared, and the situation turned from tight to hard, ultimately loosening by 125.</p>
<p>In the morning, the London big bar recently narrowed by 0.0625, while the long-term remained stable. New York silver prices also remained unchanged. London raw gold was mostly a penny, the exchange rate was seven hao less for English versus American, three cents less for versus French, and unchanged for versus Shanghai. American versus English fell by 125, unchanged for versus French, and narrowed by seven fen for versus Shanghai. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning selling prices were: English exchange at eight pence and 25, American exchange at 16 yuan and 09175, both unchanged from the previous close. After the opening, a certain bank and foreign banks competed to purchase English gold, but fortunately HSBC made every effort to maintain it, so the situation was stable. A certain bank and various foreign banks settled HSBC's English exchange (April) at eight pence and 25. HSBC's listed price was announced to be unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced to be slightly more than half a cent, calculated at 4.00%. After this, foreign firms also settled both English and American gold, but the English exchange remained unchanged under HSBC's maintenance, while the American exchange was slightly tight because the bank's willingness to sell was not smooth. Foreign firms settled Dufeng's English exchange at eight pence and 25, and purchased a certain bank's American exchange at 16 yuan and 0625. Near noon, foreign firms also absorbed Dutch Hong Kong exchange at 55 yuan and 25, and the situation was also slightly tight. At the noon close, the bank's selling prices were: English exchange at eight pence and 25, American exchange at 16 yuan and 0625.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Shoushan Youli settled HSBC's English exchange at eight pence and 25. Following this, a foreign firm settled Youli's Dutch English exchange at eight pence and 12875, and the situation was slightly soft. Later, a foreign firm purchased a certain bank's American exchange at 16 yuan and 0625. At that time, Reuters suddenly reported that the Hong Kong currency would be devalued, so those selling Hong Kong exchange surged, causing the situation to loosen. Foreign firms Anda and Holland sold Hong Kong exchange to foreign firms at 55 yuan and a half. At the evening close, the bank's selling prices were: English exchange at eight pence and 25, American exchange at 16 yuan and 025. As a result, compared to the previous day, the English was stable, the American was tight by 0.03125, and the Hong Kong exchange was uniquely loose by 125. The day's transactions are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Discount Rate Enters the Fifty Yuan Level</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange bills continued to fall slightly, entering the 50 yuan level. It was initially 50 yuan per thousand yuan, then slightly fell, reaching 49 yuan, 7 jiao, and half a cent at noon. In the afternoon, it once fell as low as 49 yuan and a half, and finally rebounded slightly, still at 49 yuan, 7 jiao, and half a cent, which was 2 jiao and a half lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Slight Narrowing of the Recent Big Bar</h3>
<p>London, 29th - The silver market was extremely stable and peaceful, and trading was also clear. After the close, there were buyers at the listed price, but sellers had to add 0.0625. The recent big bar narrowed by 0.0625, while the long-term remained stable. Also, according to New York, American spot prices remained unchanged. Also, according to Bombay, the Indian silver market was calm, and both spot and futures prices remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Debt Lacks Excitement</h3>
<p>Although Buyers are Lacking, It's Only Slightly Better</p>
<p>The securities off-market was extremely quiet yesterday. Initially, confidence seemed slightly excited, because vague and confusing peace news had suddenly emerged internationally. However, whether it was a temptation or a smokescreen, our country's fixed national policy would certainly not be tested or shaken in the slightest. Therefore, market prices still did not show any good signs. Judging from the recent sluggish market conditions, trading was depressed. Whenever trading is prosperous, it must be due to absorption from various parties, which shows that the number of chips circulating on the table is very scarce. In recent months, most of the goods gradually collected by the financial community have been transferred from scattered retail investors. Therefore, there are still few major sellers. Looking at yesterday's transactions, Runli, Hengfu, Dafeng, and No. 7 bought in the morning, while No. 14 and No. 38, as well as Tongkang and Renchang, sold. Market prices rose slightly by one or two jiao. Trading was extremely clear in the afternoon. Xieda, Runli, and Shunxiang sold slightly, while No. 4, No. 38, and Defu collected slightly. The situation was extremely quiet, mostly a sideways market. As a result, market prices only improved slightly by one jiao to one jiao and a half. The total transaction volume was about 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Slight Trading in Water and Electricity Stocks</p>
<p>Stock Market Conditions: Over 70 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company preferred stock were traded at a price of 6 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Far East Bank Stocks Continue to Fall</p>
<p>London, 29th (Wednesday) - The listed market prices of Far East companies' stocks owned by British businesses showed continued declines in bank stocks, while others remained unchanged. Jardine Matheson Bank stocks continued to fall by 2 shillings and 6 pence, with the price at £8 10 shillings. HSBC London registered stocks continued to fall by half a pound, with the price at £82 and a half. Also, Hong Kong registered stocks also fell by one pound, with the price at £84.</p>
<p>Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bonds Rise by One Pound</p>
<p>London, 29th (Wednesday) - Among Chinese foreign currency bonds, in addition to the Anglo-German continued loan Anglo-issued bonds falling another pound and a half, with the price at £73, the three types of Rehabilitation, Longhai, and Beijing-Shanghai slightly rose. The Anglo-issued debt of the Rehabilitation public debt and the printed debt of the Longhai Railway each rose by half a pound, with the former priced at £52 and the latter priced at £18. The price of Beijing-Shanghai Railway Company stock rose by one pound, with the price at £26, while the rest remained unchanged. London's supply of goods for sale included £15,000 of the Huguang Railway public debt, German-issued, printed, and winning bonds, with a selling price of £22 and a half, half a pound less than the listed price of unwinning tickets.</p>
<p>Gonghexing Stock Sees High Price</p>
<p>The Public Industry Association reported that the Shanghai foreign stock market suddenly tended towards chaotic phenomena today. However, various high-quality public bonds had special demand, and there was a huge transaction volume in electric power bonds, with a price of 91 yuan and 5 jiao, and buyers continued to be smooth. Gonghexing tram and tap water stocks (both with interest) were not lacking in demand, and Gonghexing stock saw its high price of 207 yuan and 5 jiao again. There was no shortage of cash in the market, and there were those who demanded profits, but they were slightly hindered by the still uncertain European situation and did not dare to invest. Jardine Matheson stocks were slightly weak, and rubber stocks were also weak.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Large Players Are Still Dragging in on Dips, Causing Yarn Prices to Fluctuate; 20-Count Yarn Feels the Pressure of Over-Supply</h3>
<p>The yarn market, after a major fall, has entered a sideways trend, but confidence has improved slightly. Most of the floating goods in the hands of general traders have been cleared. Large players with sufficient strength remain firm in their attitude, and not only do they not spit out the absorbed goods, but they also come to pull up prices when they are low, so a step can be temporarily stabilized. However, actual sales are still as deserted as ever due to the impact of traffic disruptions. Only 10-count coarse yarn is still wanted by Tianjin agents, so the market is slightly bullish, but they also dislike the high price, and yesterday it also turned cold. However, stocks are lacking, but 20-count yarn still feels the pressure of over-supply, and the business that is done is temporary in nature, so it fluctuates up and down from time to time.</p>
<p>The current yarn situation: At the opening in the morning, fellow traders gathered to discuss, and most people said that although business was small, the price had fallen greatly, and there might be a possibility of temporary stabilization, so there were fewer floating goods in the market, and the market was even more stable. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse was slightly lower by 5 jiao than the previous day's price, at 372 yuan. The Hong Kong gang traded 80 bales. After a while, actual demand was still sluggish, and many scattered sellers spat out, returning to a small 1 yuan and a half, with the lowest price at 370 yuan. After the price fell, some people came to buy again, and many came to collect again, and it immediately turned upwards, still to 372 yuan. In the afternoon, the market was not very changeable due to the rain and the scarcity of people attending the meeting. In general, it was a wavering path. As a result, it was found that the various gangs bought a total of 1,085 bales throughout the day. The market price of 20-count Double Horse Sky Maiden was slightly weaker by 5 jiao, and Shepherd was not very different from the previous day. The rest fell by about 1 yuan. The amount of purchases by each gang is listed separately below:</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market is still good, and actual demand has not improved much, but most people are optimistic and say that the future looks good. The current price of 20-count Water Moon yarn is 342-3 yuan, and the price of 20-count Blue Phoenix is 331-2 yuan.</p>
<h3>High Price Attracts Zhaoyuan Customers; Tongzhou Fine Velvet Flows in Continuously</h3>
<p>The business of local cotton has turned weak, and the factories have not taken any action, mainly because the cotton yarn market is weak, resulting in a lack of enthusiasm. However, fellow traders' transactions of delivering early shipments are still continuous, but the amount is very small, so market prices have fallen again. The selling price of Tongzhou cotton has fallen by more than half a yuan compared to the previous day, and the fire engine cotton has also fallen by 2 jiao and a half. As for the source, along the Subei route, due to the high prices in Shanghai, general traders raise funds and take risks to ship goods. High prices attract Zhaoyuan customers, so the arrival of goods has been smooth recently. If they arrive in Shanghai smoothly, the profits will be unimaginable. 1,539 bales of Tongzhou fine velvet cotton arrived at the pier, and 300 pieces of Qidong cotton arrived. The prosperity of current cotton sales and the amount are listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Japanese Factories Purchase Brazilian Cotton; Yesterday's Transactions Reached a Huge Volume of 16,000 Bales; U.S. Cotton Exports Reach Subsidy Levels; Southern Opposition</h3>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: In the New York cotton market, due to Roosevelt's endorsement of cotton export subsidies, Southern congressmen held a meeting and strongly opposed the export subsidy, especially Smith. Therefore, the cotton market was very chaotic. However, according to Roosevelt, the release of loan cotton and the appropriation of export subsidies, this year's new cotton and the Cotton Loan Act will remain effective. As a result, near-term prices fell by six British points, while long-term prices rose by eight or nine British points. Yesterday, the Indian market was closed, and it was predicted to fall by one and a half rupees. Egypt fell by twenty British points. Yesterday, the exchange rate was slightly tight, and the converted cotton price in legal currency still fell. U.S. cotton and Brazilian cotton fell by 4 jiao and a half per dan, Indian cotton fell by 2 jiao and a half, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than 1 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading was very quiet, and no transactions were heard from Chinese factories. However, Japanese factories purchased Brazilian cotton very strongly yesterday, totaling about 16,000 bales. The water freight for Brazilian goods arriving in China is also very scarce. The Brazilian cotton ordered yesterday will not arrive until July or August. Yesterday, the purchasers of Brazilian cotton included Gongda 4,000 bales, Donghua 3,000 bales, Tongxing 3,000 bales, Shanghai Factory 2,000 bales, Yufeng and Toyota 1,500 bales each, and Neiwaichang 1,000 bales. The foreign cotton prices calculated yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>Raw Material Category Delivered to Factory Including Tax</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Finished Dyed Cloth; Sales in the Southwest Are Improving; Tianjin Agents Actively Purchase Eastern Piece Goods</h3>
<p>National Cloth Finished Dyed Goods: Plain cloth and blue cloth twill are seeing renewed sales in the Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangdong regions. Sichuan agents are purchasing over 2,000 pieces of plain cloth, poplin, plain fine twill, fine cloth, colored cloth, and printed piece goods for transshipment to Yunnan. Yunnan agents are purchasing over 2,200 pieces of Shilin cloth, colored twill, poplin, striped plain printed colored satin, etc. The remaining amount of previously ordered goods is still huge and is being reported for loading one after another. Guangdong agents are adding goods, with the western region being more prosperous. Over 3,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, plain cloth, and plain twill are being newly purchased in Nanning, Leizhou, Mazhang, and other places. However, the purchase demand for white goods is very thin, only related to the local dyeing business, purchasing over 100 pieces of fine twill and fine cloth. The coarse cloth market continues to be soft, and local sales are scattered. Local agents are reselling hand goods at loose prices, and the market is in a slump. However, finished dyed cloth is selling strongly in the southwest, and local retail and wholesale are also very prosperous. Therefore, the market is firm, and sellers with scarce goods are raising prices.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods: The actual sales of white goods fine cloth, fine twill, and local customers continue to be strong. The price of scarce dyed blanks has been raised by another 5 fen per piece. Due to the activity in Niuzhuang on the northern route, and the shortage and high prices of goods in Tianjin, Tianjin agents are absorbing goods strongly, purchasing 600 to 700 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill of various brands. Local dyeing factories are again purchasing over 1,000 pieces of colored twill and colored cloth for futures due to the smooth sales of colored twill and colored cloth. The highest bid for Longtian fine twill has been sold at 12 yuan and 1 jiao. Foreign firms are opening 300 pieces of fine cloth, 12-pound colored ball at 12 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2 fen and a half per piece, Flying Fish at 12 yuan, 2 jiao, and a half, and Five Blessings at 12 yuan and 9 fen.</p>
<p>Exports: Yesterday, 250 pieces were shipped to Ningbo, and today another 220 pieces are being shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Foodstuffs: Over 40,000 Bags of Foreign Flour Newly Arrived; Local Flour Mill Prices Repeatedly Fall Secretly; Northern Merchants Selling for Only $4.30</h3>
<p>The market for spot flour from factories is in a continuous slump because sales channels to merchants are gradually becoming quiet. Southern merchants have not been moving large quantities for a long time. After the factory prices for Northern merchants were specially reduced, entire batches have been traded. However, recently, flour prices in Tianjin have also fallen due to the influence of foreign flour. Furthermore, there is a shortage of ship space in Shanghai, and goods being handled cannot be loaded and shipped. Therefore, new transactions have sharply decreased, and special price reductions are being considered before deals can be accepted. Factories and merchants are at a standstill, but as a result, the factories, forced by circumstances, have been sacrificing profits and repeatedly lowering prices. It is heard that "Battleship Brand" has fallen to $4.35, and "Artillery Brand" is only opening at $4.30, but the factories are unwilling to publicly announce these prices because the selling prices are not consistent with those in this street and to Southern merchants. In the formal market, the price remains at $4.45 with exchange rate included. The flour market is greatly affected by the dumping of foreign flour. Although prices have gradually decreased, it is feared that it will be difficult to establish a foothold in the future. Regarding the import and export of flour, there are 2,500 bags coming from Hong Kong and transshipped to Qingdao, another 8,500 bags also coming from Hong Kong and transshipped to Yantai, and another 3,000 bags transshipped to Tianjin.</p>
<p>The foreign flour market is also softening. Besides past orders arriving, it is heard that the Gongli Foreign Firm has a newly arrived shipment of over 40,000 bags. It is reported that this ship entered port on the 28th, and current inventory is increasing daily. Adding to this, local flour is repeatedly decreasing in price to compete, so foreign flour currently held in hand by firms is being sold in the market, with prices falling from $4.30 to $4.20 (cash). However, actual transactions by local merchants are not as prosperous as in the previous two days. Therefore, yesterday, the entire batch trading felt lacking and secretly the foreign flour prices has dropped quickly for 10 cents.</p>
<p>The wheat market is also seemingly stable but secretly loosening. Because flour prices have been falling for several days, the foreign wheat that various factories had previously ordered is arriving successively. Therefore, factories are consistently taking a wait-and-see attitude, and customers also find the prices too high. Although the supply of local wheat is currently scarce, the environment already feels unfavorable. It is heard that the secret price has fallen below $7, but official transactions remain firm.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Factory Silk in Hand, Eager to Sell</h3>
<p>Overseas silk markets are still stable. New York silk prices have not changed. Exchange prices are up 2.5 cents in the near term, Yokohama forward contracts are up 9 yuan, and spot is up a small 5 yuan. Lyon silk prices have not moved. Shanghai factories are still observing through foreign firms, but those with inventory in hand are eager to sell, so the market sentiment seems to be weakening. Prices from French firms are still slightly lower. Only 30 dan of 16-18 and 18-20 stripe patterns were traded. Local firms opened at $1670, and Yangzi firms haggled at $1680. Domestic sales are still sluggish. Yesterday, a silk factory purchased several dozen dan of Chefoo silk at $920.</p>
<h3>Du Geng (Rice) Sellers Have Strong Mentality</h3>
<p>Buyers Turn Cold</p>
<p>Rice Shops Openly Increase Price by 40 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the supply from various merchants only included No. 15 from Hexia. Carload shipments from other places did not arrive at all, so sellers' mentality was quite firm. The morning market calls were especially high. However, shops on this street, after moving rice the day before, resumed taking a wait-and-see attitude. Speculators also rarely inquired, so the situation was flat, and the market presented a standstill between the two sides. As a result, the prices of rice, whether thick or thin, barely held firm. In reality, rice such as the Hexia cargo was already softening somewhat. In short, reviewing the market over the past week, it has been high and low at times, and the situation has not deviated from a gyrating state. Prices of various rice types such as Du, Yang, Jian, and Yuan have not changed.</p>
<p>Checking rice import and export, there are 3,797 bags coming from Hong Kong and transshipped to Qingdao, and another 3,500 bags also coming from Hong Kong and transshipped to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Regarding retail rice prices, yesterday, the rice merchants officially announced a break from past restrictions. Under the guise of commission, transportation, and miscellaneous fees, an additional 40 cents in legal tender will be added per stone, effective April 1. They still claim to maintain the limited price while considering the people's food supply. In reality, it is merely turning the secret into the open, which shows that the rice industry's so-called maintenance of limited prices is nothing more than window dressing.</p>
<h3>High-Grade Foreign Rice Unwilling to Sell Lightly; Ordinary Ke Xian Mediocre</h3>
<p>After Ke Xian rice was actively digested by the street the previous day, merchants and speculators took the opportunity to try to sell, so yesterday morning, after a period of bustle and an upward trend, it turned back to a standstill. However, Yang Jian and foreign rice on the market were both quite firm. Ke Xian transactions still amounted to 3,000 piculs, mostly handled by various households in the street. Merchants and speculators did not engage in much business. Market conditions were not significantly different from the previous market. Only ordinary goods appeared slightly mediocre. High-grade foreign rice is still opening around $17, but the "Pagoda Brand" owned by foreign firms, because of its higher quality, is unwilling to lightly sell at market price, so it is calling for a price that is 30 to 40 cents higher.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Rises and Falls Depending on Dalian Market; Raw Oil Sales Stagnant, Showing Fatigue</h3>
<p>The key to the rise and fall of soybean oil is still inseparable from the manipulation and constraints of Dalian. Yesterday morning, the Dalian telegram started rising and ended falling, causing the hearts of the people in this city to change three times in one day. The opening rose by 20 to 30 cents, then fell midway, and fell more than half of the previous increase. In the end, it moved forward again. The reason is that the future oil thrown by Japanese merchants seems to be gradually absorbed by Mitsui and Sanwa Foreign Firms under the circumstances that the slots are insufficient for commercial transport. Because the futures market is higher than the spot price, the market yesterday, besides spot oil, was entirely speculation among merchants. It is estimated that 150 pieces of Yantai oil were traded at $23.90, 30 large baskets of Lianqi oil at $30.08, and 200 pieces for April delivery at $30.70 and $30.75. 50 barrels of current Dalian oil at $33.25, 50 barrels loaded in late March at $33.25, and over 1,000 barrels for April delivery at $33.35 to $33.15. 600 barrels for May delivery at $33.30 to $33.10.</p>
<p>The weakness of the raw oil market has become apparent because sales are limited and there is no supply coming. It is heard that Qingdao has decided to release 6,000 pieces successively, so the market is again showing signs of disintegration. Fortunately, the market did not suffer too much in the rising tide of soybean oil. The market only fell by 20 cents yesterday. 20 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at $28.20, and 500 cans of Yantai canned oil were traded at $37.</p>
<h3>Coal: Sparse Transactions of Indian Coal</h3>
<p>Merchants are observing Indian bituminous coal and there are no wholesale transactions. Dealers are also unwilling to easily sell because of the high cost, resulting in a standstill. Although a certain firm had some sparse business yesterday, it was moving slowly. No. 1 Indian lump coal opened at $42 per ton, No. 2 at $40, and lower-grade fines at $41, with dealers handling their own transportation. Customers add another $4 for transport.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Public Concession Court Agreement Continues in Effect After Today's Expiration Because Neither Party Intends to Cancel or Revise</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Court Agreement was signed on February 17 of the 19th year of the Republic of China by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Great Britain, the United States, France, Netherlands, and Brazil. After being extended repeatedly for three years, it expires again on the 31st of this month. According to the agreement, if either party wishes to cancel, it should notify the other party six months before the expiration date, otherwise it should continue in effect. It is heard that although the agreement has expired, because neither party has notified cancellation or revision, it should naturally continue in effect. It is heard that the original agreement has a total of ten articles and attachments. According to the provisions of Article 10, "This agreement and its associated exchanged notes shall take effect on April 1, 1930, and shall continue in effect for three years from that date. Its term may be extended upon mutual agreement between the two parties at the expiration." This agreement expired on March 31 of the 22nd year, and was extended for three years with the consent of both parties. It expired again on March 31 of the 25th year and was extended again for three years until today (i.e., March 31 of the 28th year).</p>
<h3>Ningbo Defense Command Permits Free Export of Goods</h3>
<p>No Need to Apply for Transport Permits</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Transport of Materials Aiding the Enemy to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to shipping industry news, because enemy materials and the Zhejiang Customs have received orders from the Ministry of Finance to handle the prohibition of transport, the previous order from the Ningbo Defense Command that goods leaving the Yong River must obtain transport permits is no longer necessary. However, to prohibit the import of enemy goods and restrict the sale of foreign goods, all goods entering and leaving the port will still be handled in accordance with the prescribed measures. This case has been reported to and approved by Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Huang Jing through secret telegram No. 2. It will be implemented from April 1. Thereafter, general goods should be allowed to be exported freely without needing to apply for transport permits. However, when shipping enemy materials to the Shanghai Concession, the regulations of the Ministry's "Review Measures for Transporting Enemy Materials to Shanghai" should be followed. The Customs will inspect and release the goods.</p>
<h3>Registration Procedures for Vessels on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line</h3>
<p>Six Passenger Ships</p>
<p>Ten Cargo Ships</p>
<p>Since the resumption of direct navigation on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, the vessels traveling must be designated by the exporting merchants and approved by the Defense Command before entering the port. The Ningbo Defense Command has approved the first batch of registered vessels that have been certified as qualified by the Navigation Affairs Office. The list includes 16 vessels: Moufu, Deping, Ende, Tangsai, Meida, Xinan'na, Hana, Zhejiang, Yingzhou, Male, Haifu, Liangzhou, Libao, Gaodeng, Xin Beijing, and Shantay. It has been decided that starting from April 1, the Shipping Association will allocate routes to each vessel, schedule services, and sail according to schedule. There is no need for exporters to apply for each voyage. The Shipping Association has internally decided that six passenger ships—Deping, Moufu, Xin Beijing, Tangsai, Shantay, and Meida—will each enter the port six times a month, sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo once every five days. The remaining ten ships will serve as cargo ships, sailing according to the needs of cargo transport.</p>
<h3>Salt Transported from Fujian to Ningbo</h3>
<p>Carried by the Xinfuzhou Vessel</p>
<p>Totaling 2,300 Tons</p>
<p>The Ningbo Defense Command recently telegraphed the Yin County Shipping Association, stating: "Received telegram from Commander-in-Chief Liu Yangwu Dezheng, stating: 'Director Guo Ma of the Salt Collection and Transportation Office telegraphed that, upon order, the Yihe Company's Xinfuzhou vessel, carrying 2,300 tons of Fujian salt, has been chartered by the Fujian Salt Affairs Bureau and is scheduled to set sail for Ningbo on the 26th. Upon investigation, this vessel has not yet been registered. It is hereby telegraphed for your approval. In consideration of the importance of salt transport and the urgency of the situation, please grant permission to notify the Ningbo Defense Command to implement it. If registration procedures need to be completed, they will be completed upon arrival of the vessel in Ningbo. Please also provide instructions, etc.' In addition to telegramming provisional approval for entry once, the regulations must be followed thereafter. It is specifically telegraphed for compliance." It is heard that the Yin County Shipping Association has complied accordingly.</p>
<h3>Puppet Fu Xiao'an Raises Unreasonable Demands Again, Separately Notifying the Consular Body and the Municipal Council, Actually Demanding to Take Over the First Special District Court</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports: "According to sources revealed last night (29th), the 'Shanghai Mayor' under the 'Puppet Reformed Government,' Fu Xiao'an, yesterday sent the same note to Consul General and Leading Consul Nilon and Municipal Council Chairman Fankerling, demanding an immediate response to his note of March 10, which had not yet received a reply. Fu's previous note demanded the suppression of illegal elements in the Public Concession, the reopening of the 'Special Municipal Police Bureau's' Dafulu Branch, the return of the land bureau files left to the Municipal Council by the former Chinese administrative organs, the placement of the First Special District Court under the jurisdiction of the 'Special Municipal Government,' and the prohibition of displaying the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag in the Public Concession. Yesterday's note was delivered to Fankerling at 2:00 PM, demanding an 'immediate and clear response' on whether the Consular Body and the Municipal Council were 'prepared to cooperate with him,' and requesting these two administrative bodies to announce their views on transferring the First Special District Court to the 'New Municipal Government.' Fu also declared in his note that, after April 1, the 'Special Municipal Government' would consider any judgment of the First Special District Court in civil and criminal cases to be illegal. The agreements concluded between the relevant countries and the Chinese government regarding this court will expire on March 31. If the 'Special Municipal Government's' administration of the court is recognized, it is prepared to continue in effect. Fu also demanded immediate action on the other four demands made on March 10, giving the 'Special Municipal Government' a satisfactory answer to promote friendship and demonstrate cooperation."</p>
<h3>Rice Merchants Association Decides Retail Rice Prices to Increase Slightly; Few Arrivals, Firm Prices; Decided to Add 40 Cents Per Stone</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Merchants Association has repeatedly received letters from member rice shops, stating that since last month, rice prices have soared. The association has limited rice prices, with the highest grade of white rice not exceeding 14 yuan per stone. However, members must add fees for brokers and transportation to the limited price when purchasing rice from the rice market. Retail sales in stores cannot exceed the limited price, so stores must subsidize commission and transportation costs. It may be possible to endure the pain for a short period, but now that the rice price increase has extended and shows no sign of abating, the stores cannot bear the long-term losses and business is difficult to maintain, requesting relief, etc. The association convened an executive supervisory board meeting the day before yesterday, attended by Zhang Nianxuan, Lu Wenshao, Shi Hongdong, Pan Jibin, Huang Ruyuan, Gu Hongjun, and more than ten others. Chairman Zhang Nianxuan reported on the letters from the member rice shops and began the discussion. It was generally agreed that since late February of this year, rice prices had gradually increased. At that time, it was still the middle of the Lunar New Year. It was assumed that each store had a small inventory at the end of the Lunar Year and these price increases may have been caused by a short-term shortage due to rain and reduced arrivals. Once the weather cleared and goods flooded in, prices could return to normal. Therefore, the association strongly urged the industry to endure the pain and sacrifice profits to maintain the limited price. Although goods purchased from the market were not clearly graded as mid-grade, extra fees for transportation and brokerage had to be added, while stores still sold at the limited price without adding a penny. All members were able to endure losses and fulfill their obligations, originally hoping that the source would increase slightly and rice prices would gradually return to normal. Unexpectedly, daily arrivals were still scarce, rice price increases extended, and prices remained firm without any sign of falling. How could the industry bear long-term losses? After weighing the situation and reasoning, it was difficult to sustain. It was decided that, starting from April 1, each store's retail rice price would increase by 40 cents per stone for commission and transportation fees to avoid long-term losses for the stores and maintain capital, while the limited price would be maintained and unaffected. The meeting adjourned after discussion.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Creek Boat Jam Severely Blocks Traffic</h3>
<p>The section of the Wusong River (commonly known as Suzhou Creek) in the Public Concession, from the Waibaidu Bridge westward to the New Garbage Bridge, has been blocked since the day before yesterday due to too many boats coming from the inland areas of western Shanghai, making navigation impossible. From 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM yesterday, the Water Police tried to clear the waterway, barely allowing one boat to pass. However, it was soon blocked again. In the afternoon, the tide receded, making navigation even more difficult. The area from the New Garbage Bridge westward through the Wuzhen Road Bridge, the New Zhabei Bridge, to the sampan factory's New Bridge was packed solid. Boats were stranded on both sides of the bank. Looking east and west from the bridge, the docked boats resembled a swarm of ants. Looking at each other, they could only sigh helplessly. However, as of last night, navigation had not resumed and traffic had been blocked for two days.</p>
<h3>French Concession Opens New Children's Park</h3>
<p>Located on the Site of the Former Verdun Park</p>
<p>Scheduled to Open Tomorrow</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" reports that the children's park called Verdun Park, located in the commercial center of the French Concession, is scheduled to officially open on Saturday (i.e., tomorrow) after two weeks of construction. This new park is not large, forming a triangle adjacent to the French Tennis Association's tennis court. There is an entrance along Avenue Joffre. In previous summers, the area was leased by a grassland cinema, but business was not prosperous. This small piece of land is planted with various trees and new grass needs to be laid. It is reported that those who purchase monthly tickets can enter.</p>
<h3>Guangdong and Xiafei Collide with Each Other; Both Ships Severely Damaged; The Accident Occurred in the Waters Between Shantou and Hong Kong; Heavy Fog at Sea Led to the Incident</h3>
<p>(Special Report from Our Newspaper) The Great British Company's new postal ship, Guangdong, weighing over 17,000 tons, first arrived in Shanghai from the United Kingdom on November 13 of last year, joining the Eurasia route. On December 6, it returned to the UK from Shanghai via Japan. This was the vessel's second trip to the Far East. This past Sunday (26th), it returned to Shanghai from Japan. The day before yesterday (28th), it loaded cargo and passengers in Shanghai, heading to Hong Kong via Singapore and the South Seas ports before returning to London via the Mediterranean. Last night, the city suddenly heard that the vessel had collided with the French Postal Company's giant vessel, General Xiafei, in the waters between Shantou and Hong Kong, about 130 miles from Bolica Point, due to heavy fog at around 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Both ships were severely damaged. The Guangdong had three holes punched in it, fortunately above the waterline. The ship's owner urgently sailed towards Hong Kong and had arrived last night. After the accident, the General Xiafei also sailed back to Hong Kong due to the severe damage to the hull. It is expected to arrive in Hong Kong this morning. Both vessels will be docked for repairs. The General Xiafei was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (April 1), but it has been postponed due to this. The date of arrival in Shanghai will be determined after repairs. The date of the Guangdong's return to the UK will also be delayed.</p>
<p>(Reuter's, Hong Kong, 30th) The Great British Steamship Company's vessel Guangdong collided with the French vessel General Xiafei in the fog north of Hong Kong this morning. The General Xiafei has sent a wireless telegram stating that it is currently sailing back to Hong Kong. According to reports, the French Ambassador to China, Gossmar, is one of the passengers on the ship. The Guangdong may not be able to reach Hong Kong this morning due to fog at sea and damage to the hull. The ship is currently leaking, but does not need rescue. It is likely that the Kitlerel, currently in Hong Kong, will replace the Guangdong and sail to England on schedule, but this has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<h3>Counterproductive: Counterfeit Currency Harms the Japanese; Chinese Use Counterfeit Currency to Exchange for Japanese Yen; Japanese Cannot Use the Currency to Purchase Goods</h3>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" reports that a certain foreign businessman arrived in Shanghai from Beiping yesterday (29th). According to him, the recently implemented monetary policy to support the "United Reserve Bank" banknotes may not benefit the Japanese themselves. Before implementing the new currency policy prohibiting the circulation of legal tender from the Chinese government, Chinese merchants in North China had imported a large number of Japanese goods. Since they were forced to accept "United Reserve Bank" banknotes paid by Japanese merchants, the result now is that Chinese merchants import Japanese goods with this valueless currency, and the Chinese merchants are the ones who profit, while the Japanese merchants lose. This is because Japanese merchants cannot circulate "United Reserve Bank banknotes" in Japan. However, Japanese merchants, represented by Chinese, must repay the price of goods with legal tender from the Chinese government when purchasing raw materials from various towns and cities in the North China interior for transport and export; otherwise, farmers refuse to sell their agricultural products. As for the exchange rate, it was a few days ago one yuan of legal tender for 1.20 yuan of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes. This difference is especially large when Japanese merchants export large quantities of Chinese raw materials, amounting to a huge sum. For the past few months, the situation has become increasingly dire for the Japanese. Therefore, the Japanese authorities finally decided to implement the new currency regulations and implement an export control plan, stipulating that only Japanese merchants are allowed to conduct export trade in North China. As far as the foreign businessman can predict, the new currency and export control plan will ultimately not benefit the Japanese themselves. Once the new currency regulations are adopted, most of the Chinese merchants in North China will almost completely stop selling raw materials to the Japanese. On the other hand, Chinese merchants have also expressed that they are unwilling to import Japanese goods again, at least not as much as they have been importing in recent months. The strange fact is that after the Japanese authorities prohibited the circulation of legal tender, most Chinese merchants tried their best to collect a large number of Japanese yen banknotes. According to the foreign businessman, a large number of Japanese yen banknotes have been secretly transported to Shanghai to be exchanged for foreign currencies other than legal tender. Many Chinese merchants in North China are willing to exchange "United Reserve Bank" banknotes for Japanese banknotes. Now, under the new currency conditions, they would rather hold on and not engage in commercial activities. The foreign businessman also mentioned rumors about Wu Peifu, saying that Wu still insists on his own ideas, waiting for the Japanese side to fully comply with his demands. Wu once requested that he be allowed to lead several divisions of independent Chinese troops and be granted full authority to maintain peace and order in the North China region, especially Hebei Province, and demanded that the Japanese authorities guarantee the funding to maintain this army. The Japanese authorities were probably willing to agree to this request, but Japan is too poor and unable to raise the necessary funds. As far as he knows, Wu is still in Beiping. Since the Japanese authorities talked about Wu becoming a Japanese puppet, no other news has been heard. The merchant did not say, "I believe Wu is an honest Chinese gentleman who would not serve the Japanese in such a cruel plan."</p>

<h3>After the Tianmu Mountain Meeting: Guerrilla Warfare Imminent in Western Zhejiang; Hua Tingjin's Army to Lead Troops Eastward; Japanese Troops on the Jiangxi Border Poised to Invade Western Zhejiang; Japanese Aircraft Bombing Eastern Zhejiang for Days with Minimal Damage</h3>
<p>Special dispatch from our newspaper: Since the Japanese navy harassed various coastal ports of Zhejiang Province, attempting to coordinate with the army and encroach upon Western Zhejiang, the Chinese military authorities held an important meeting at Tianmu Mountain to reallocate defense responsibilities, planning to use five divisions to prevent the Japanese army from invading south. On the Qiantang River front, the 　Army Group under Liu Jianxu is amassing troops, continuously crossing the river to counterattack Hangzhou. The 62nd Division and the 45th Independent Brigade are very active in the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway area. According to reliable sources, the Japanese troops entrenched in the Xinshi area have recently been cleared out by Xie's regiment of the 62nd Division. The Su-Jia (Suzhou-Jiaxing) Road, the lifeline of the Japanese army's rear, is under the control of Zhu Xi's advancing army in southern Jiangsu. This unit consists mostly of soldiers from Jiangsu and Zhejiang and possesses substantial strength. Last autumn, they once recovered Nanxun and Zhenze, drawing the attention of the Japanese army. Subsequently, they were ordered to return to the rear for intensified training and reorganized into a crack force. At the end of January this year, Deputy Commander Wang Songxian led some powerful detachments to advance on the Su-Jia Road at opportune moments. As for Commander-in-Chief Zhu Xi, after the Tianmu Mountain meeting, he has consulted with Huang Shaoxiong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, regarding operational matters and will soon lead his troops eastward, coordinating with the regular army to launch extensive guerrilla warfare, completing the task of threatening and containing the enemy. The situation in Western Zhejiang is about to suddenly become tense again.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops on the Jiangxi Border Attempt to Invade Zhejiang</p>
<p>A telegram from Jinhua reports that the Japanese troops invading Nanchang appear to be advancing towards Western Zhejiang. Chinese military and political authorities, including Liu Jianxu, Huang Shaoxiong, and Zhou Enlai, have been stationed in various areas to establish a tight defense. No less than 200,000 Chinese troops are concentrated along the Zhejiang coast, ready to fight. If the Japanese army invades, they are determined to exact a heavy price.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Reconnoiter and Bomb Various Locations in Eastern Zhejiang</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from Modern News Agency learned from foreign shipping industry sources in this city that Japanese aircraft have been flying to various locations in Eastern Zhejiang for reconnaissance for days. On the morning of the 26th, Ningbo issued three air raid alerts. The first time, a faint engine sound was heard, but the aircraft did not enter the territory, and the alert was lifted immediately. The second time, three Japanese aircraft were spotted circling over Yuyao and then dropping over a dozen bombs on the Linshanwei area, causing no damage. The third time, around 9:00 PM, the Ningbo authorities implemented a blackout, and Zhenhai also implemented it simultaneously, lifting it at 9:50 PM. Additionally, on the afternoon of the 26th, two Japanese aircraft flew to the Shangyu coast for reconnaissance, dropping bombs over Lihai, destroying several civilian houses and killing two civilians. They then flew to Songxia Town to wreak havoc, causing no damage. At 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 28th, a Japanese aircraft flew over Baiguan in Shangyu, dropping three bombs, destroying seven houses. It then flew to Songxia Town, dropping one bomb, which landed in the Xiehe Sauce Garden, killing and injuring three people.</p>
<p>No Japanese Warships Sighted Along the Coast</p>
<p>Several Japanese warships had been wantonly harassing Taizhou, Zhenhai, Dinghai, and other places along the coast of Eastern Zhejiang and patrolling back and forth since the 17th of last month, seizing fishing boats and searching foreign vessels. According to news from foreign ships arriving in Shanghai from Wenzhou and Ningbo, no Japanese warships have been seen along the coast of Eastern Zhejiang for days. No Japanese warships were found in the waters of Zhenhaikou, Fenghua Port, Xiangshan Port, and Hengshanbu in Ningbo. The situation in various places is peaceful, but the stationed troops are maintaining strict vigilance and have not relaxed their guard.</p>
<p>Residents of Zhenhai Voluntarily Relocating</p>
<p>The situation in Zhenhai has been quite peaceful since the Japanese warship shelling stopped, but many residents are voluntarily relocating. It is reported that the entire city has fewer than 800 households, and only about half of the shops are open for business. On the morning of the 26th, representatives from the Zhenhai Party, government, and military sectors convened a conference on defending Zhenhai at the Zhenhai Maritime Police Bureau. One of the proposals was to blockade the Dajia River (i.e., the Yong River estuary), but it was not approved due to its impact on travel and cargo transportation. The previous rumors circulating in Shanghai about the Zhenhai gap being blockaded have thus been proven to be unfounded. Furthermore, the old Taiping轮 ship, prepared to block the gaps in the Zhenhai blockade line when necessary, is still docked at the China Merchants Wharf east of Zhenhaiwei Street and has not been moved.</p>
<p>The Ningbo-Dinghai Route Operates as Usual</p>
<p>After the Shanghai-Dinghai route was suspended again, the Ningbo-Dinghai route continues to operate as usual, with the Libao 轮 ship traveling back and forth. Therefore, passengers and cargo traveling from Shanghai to Dinghai can still detour via Ningbo. Although the authorities have prohibited ships from calling at the Shipu port, the Lidou 轮 ship is specially permitted to call once every Saturday to facilitate passenger and cargo transportation, while all other ships are strictly prohibited from calling. After the Ningbo-Taizhou route was suspended again, the situation in Haimen is gradually becoming more stable, and the Gaodeng Maler 轮 ship is preparing to resume service. The ships on the Shanghai-Taizhou route are not planning to send ships for the time being.</p>
<h3>First Thunderstorm Since Spring in This City</h3>
<p>Indoor Temperature Above 65 Degrees</p>
<p>Caused by a Low-Pressure System Passing Through</p>
<p>The weather in this city, after being affected by a high-pressure system passing through last week and becoming cold for a time, gradually became warmer afterward. In the past few days, the daily temperature has been gradually increasing, which is a normal phenomenon after the beginning of spring. However, the climate yesterday was suddenly sultry, even more so in the afternoon. The indoor temperature rose to above 65 degrees, an increase of about seven degrees compared to the previous day. At 2:00 PM, there was a rumble of thunder, followed by rain. This was the first thunderstorm of the year since the beginning of spring, caused by a low-pressure system passing through in the northeast.</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Plainclothes Soldiers Ambush Japanese Troops in Longhua; Encounter Battle Occurs at Lu-Fu Bridge; Company Commander Hu Fei Heroically Sacrifices Himself</h3>
<p>Simultaneously Conduct In-Depth Reconnaissance in the City Center</p>
<p>For months, plainclothes soldiers in the Nanshi area have formed a solid defense line, lurking in the suburbs and launching occasional attacks, exhausting the Japanese army, which is struggling to cope. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 29th), over a thousand plainclothes soldiers suddenly mobilized in large numbers, carrying light weapons, and advanced towards the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters in Longhua from the Xujia Garden area, clashing with Japanese troops at Lu-Fu Bridge. The sound of machine guns continued throughout the day, and the battle was fierce. The Japanese vanguard suffered heavy casualties and was unable to hold on, so they called up the rear guard. The two sides then remained locked in a stalemate for two hours. The Japanese army, intimidated, attempted to encircle and "eliminate" the enemy in one fell swoop. However, the plainclothes soldiers saw through their scheme and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The Japanese army could not withstand the onslaught and collapsed. Seeing that their objective had been achieved, the plainclothes soldiers took the opportunity to scatter and escape towards the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. In this battle, the plainclothes soldiers suffered over twenty casualties, while the Japanese army suffered several times more. Company Commander Hu Fei of the plainclothes soldiers also heroically sacrificed himself in this bloody battle.</p>
<p>Heavy Gunfire in the City Center</p>
<p>Last night (the 29th), heavy gunfire was heard in the city center, east of the puppet municipal government. It gradually approached the puppet government, so the Japanese army mobilized its troops and prepared to resist. Suddenly, the gunfire shifted from east to west, interspersed with the sound of small mortars and machine guns. Because it was night, the Japanese army feared being surrounded by plainclothes soldiers and dared not advance blindly, only firing wildly at random. By dawn, the gunfire had ceased, and the Japanese army searched everywhere but found nothing. They then blockaded traffic in the city center, which happened to be the time when puppet government officials were going to "work." Therefore, all the puppet officials, large and small, were blocked and unable to proceed, appearing disheveled and waiting in the suburbs for several hours before being led to work by Ishii, a senior advisor to the puppet government. Currently, the Japanese have deployed heavy troops to guard the areas around the puppet government and the city center. It is said that the gunfire was indeed caused by Chinese plainclothes soldiers threatening the Japanese army and reconnoitering their movements.</p>
<p>Contact in the Shanghai West Area</p>
<p>The other day (the 29th), guerrillas in Pudong and the Minhang area west of the Huangpu River publicly redeployed their defenses and opened fire on small Japanese warships in the Huangpu River south of Pudong, resulting in a fierce battle. Guerrilla regiments have been attacking the Japanese army in Dujiahang, south of Pudong, and Minhang, west of the Huangpu River, for two days. Stray bullets are flying everywhere, and traffic has been cut off, so all ships traveling between Shanghai and Pudong have been suspended. At the same time, Wang Jinshan's troops in the Shanghai West area have also advanced to Beixinjing, Hongqiao Road, and other places. Because the Japanese army has no troops to spare in Shanghai, they have transferred the puppet "Pacification Army" from Suzhou to Shanghai to cope with the situation. Wang's troops in the Shanghai West area have been engaged in intermittent battles with this puppet "army."</p>
<p>Tracks on Shangchuan Road Suddenly Damaged</p>
<p>The Shangchuan Railway in Pudong is the Japanese army's lifeline for transportation. In order to eliminate the guerrillas lurking in the Jujianchuan area, the Japanese have been mobilizing troops and advancing towards Chuansha for days. The night before last (the 28th), several sections of the railway tracks were suddenly damaged, so yesterday (the 29th), six Japanese military vehicles were unable to proceed. They are currently being repaired by Japanese engineers. This action was likely carried out by brave guerrillas.</p>
<h3>Guerrillas in Nanhui Establish Defenses on Land and Water</h3>
<p>Evacuate the Masses in Datuan</p>
<p>No Japanese Aircraft Dropped Bombs</p>
<p>The situation in Nanhui, Pudong, has been relatively tense recently. The Japanese army has been frequently mobilizing between Zhoupu and Xinchang for days, and rumors are circulating that they plan to invade Datuan from the east. The guerrillas are determined and have thoroughly destroyed the land traffic between Datuan and Xinchang. The masses have contributed greatly to this effort, creating a situation where all roads are blocked. On the waterways, they have adopted a step-by-step blockade strategy from Datuan to Zhongxin Bridge and then from Zhongxin Bridge to Xinchang. At every bend and key point, they have filled the river with branches and mud, leaving only a narrow gap for small boats to pass through. The land and water traffic between Nanhui County and Xinchang, and between Nancheng and Zhuqiao, have been similarly blockaded, making it difficult for the Japanese army to invade Nanhui from both directions. Furthermore, according to someone who arrived in Shanghai from Datuan via a detour yesterday, the guerrillas have implemented air defenses and evacuated the masses in the town. The rumors that Japanese aircraft flew to Datuan and dropped three bombs are untrue. The order in the town remains extremely stable. Fortifications have also been built in the suburbs of Nancheng, with large piles of defensive materials at every entrance and exit, allowing only one person to pass through at a time.</p>
<h3>Portuguese Consul-General Promoted to Consul-General in New York</h3>

<h3>Massive Imports of Flour and Wheat Affect the Domestic Flour Market; Domestic Wheat Shipped to Japan for Processing and Then Dumped in China; Japanese Flour Monopolizes North China, Driving Down Domestic Flour Prices</h3>
<p>After the war, flour mills in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were looted, and Australian and Japanese foreign flour was imported and dumped in massive quantities. At the same time, flour mills in the concessions, such as Fuxin and Fufeng, were affected by controls on wheat production in their source areas, leading to a shortage of raw materials and forcing them to order foreign wheat. As the market is flooded with foreign flour, the price of domestic flour is falling daily. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Massive Imports and Dumping of Foreign Flour</p>
<p>Previously, due to the market demand for flour exceeding supply, various flour trading companies ordered foreign flour to be shipped to Shanghai to adjust the market. In 1938, 2,547,783 quintals were imported, valued at National Currency 52,985,269 yuan. From January to February of this year, 229,136 quintals were imported, valued at National Currency 4,400,9835 yuan. Australia accounted for the largest share, totaling 1,188,140 quintals. Japan was second, totaling 1,179,454 quintals. The United States was third, totaling 270,396 quintals.</p>
<p>Concession Flour Mills Order Foreign Wheat</p>
<p>The flour mills operating in the International Settlement, such as Fuxin and Fufeng, are ordering foreign wheat due to raw materials being controlled by the Japanese puppet regime. At the same time, the Chinese government has prohibited the re-export of miscellaneous grains to occupied areas, resulting in a wheat shortage. Shipments to Shanghai are being made in batches starting this February. In February of this year, 250,458 quintals were imported, valued at National Currency 2,242,687 yuan. The United States accounted for the largest share, totaling 172,890 quintals. Australia was second, totaling 77,559 quintals.</p>
<p>Domestic Wheat Shipped to Japan for Processing</p>
<p>The wheat purchased by the Japanese puppet regime in the areas it occupies is used as raw material for Japanese flour mills in North and Central China and also shipped to Japan, where it is processed into flour and then dumped in China. In 1938, 55,631 quintals were exported, valued at National Currency 440,142 yuan, all of which was shipped to Japan. From January to February of this year, 11,430 quintals were exported, valued at National Currency 116,661 yuan, of which 8,590 quintals, valued at National Currency 78,257 yuan, were shipped to Japan.</p>
<p>Japanese Flour Monopolization Affects Domestic Flour</p>
<p>North China was originally the sole market for domestic flour, but it has been monopolized by Japanese flour since the war. The amount of domestic flour shipped north has decreased significantly. The flour sold in the North China market today, except for Australian and American flour, is almost entirely flour from Japanese mills, such as the Green Treasure Ship, Green Mitsubishi, Green Emerald, and Green Flying Crane brands. Under special circumstances, domestic flour cannot compete in the northern market. At the same time, the Shanghai market is affected by the dumping of foreign flour, the sales of domestic flour have decreased significantly, and prices are falling daily, posing a precarious future. Flour mills like Fuxin and Fufeng are forced to reduce prices to increase sales.</p>
<h3>Five-County Association Seeks New Members</h3>

<h3>Agricultural and Commercial Bank Issues Bonds and Sets Five-Year Agricultural Plan; Handles Agricultural Loans, Striving to Increase Agricultural Production; Plans Land Reclamation, Develops Cooperation, and Purchases Local Products</h3>
<p>In order to develop national agricultural production, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has approved the Agricultural and Commercial Bank to issue agricultural bonds, and has drafted a five-year agricultural plan to handle agricultural loans, increase agricultural production, plan land reclamation, develop cooperation, and purchase seven major local products. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Completing the Five-Year Agricultural Plan</p>
<p>The Agricultural and Commercial Bank aims to adjust agricultural products, circulate agricultural funds, and promote the development of rural areas nationwide. When necessary, it may submit a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to request government approval to issue agricultural bonds, but the amount is limited to the total amount of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank's fixed capital. The bank's general manager, He Lian, has delineated regions and established agricultural adjustment offices, taking into account industrial and transportation conditions, to handle agricultural adjustment affairs in extraordinary times, which are planned to be completed within five years. The agricultural plan includes (1) farmland water conservancy, (2) increasing agricultural production, (3) planning land reclamation, (4) developing cooperation, (5) agricultural loans, and (6) agricultural product transportation and sales.</p>
<p>Handling Loans and Purchasing Local Products</p>
<p>The Agricultural and Commercial Bank has cooperated with the governments and water conservancy agencies of Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and other provinces to handle water conservancy loans and production loans, including seeds, fertilizers, and draught cattle. Currently, 8.3 million yuan has been loaned for water conservancy loans, 4.87 million yuan for production loans, 2 million yuan for commercial agricultural product loans, and 81,000 yuan allocated for agricultural improvement expenses. As for the purchase of major local products nationwide, it has purchased grain, cotton, and other products worth a total of 10.17 million yuan in Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and other provinces. In Henan, Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces, it has launched a chain loan program with a total amount of 2.7 million yuan, limited to agricultural products.</p>
<p>Increasing Agricultural Production and Planning Land Reclamation</p>
<p>Regulations stipulate increasing grain production in the Northwest and increasing cotton production in the Southwest. Since implementation, it has been quite effective. Last year, cotton production in the Southwest increased significantly compared to the previous year. Wheat fields in Shaanxi Province increased by 2 million mu, and production increased by 12 million dan. (2) Cotton production in Sichuan was 900,000 dan, a doubling compared to the previous year, and cotton fields were expanded by 74,000 mu. As for planning land reclamation, it has been implemented in Shaanxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces, delineating reclamation areas and resettling refugees for land reclamation. Regarding agricultural cooperation, it has been actively promoted, and 47 cooperative treasuries have been established in Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and other provinces. Agricultural warehouses have been widely established in various places to store and mortgage agricultural products.</p>
<p>Actively Developing Water Conservancy Projects</p>
<p>To develop inland agriculture, water conservancy should be developed first to facilitate irrigation. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has established the Central Hydraulic Engineering Laboratory to conduct hydraulic engineering experiments and water conservancy research.

<h3>Canned Food Disguise Containing Opium Paste; Shipped from Kunming, Seized by Customs Officials; Two Suspects Arrested, Original Offender Awaits Capture and Further Interrogation</h3>
<p>A soil trafficker, Ying Dequan, recently shipped 72 cans of opium paste from Kunming, each can containing five taels, totaling 360 taels, worth over 5,000 yuan. He shipped it to Shanghai through the post office, disguising it as canned food. Upon arrival, on the 28th of this month at 3:00 AM, he instructed Shi Ying (aka Fengchun), a Nanjing resident living in Room 43, North China Apartments, Ma Road, French Concession, to pick up the opium paste at the General Post Office on North Sichuan Road. The matter was investigated by customs officials, who arrested Shi and reported it to the French police. After investigating Shi's case, they subsequently arrested his accomplice, Feng Tianbao, 42 years old, at No. 481 Kangti Road, and brought him to the police station. Yesterday afternoon, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. First, the police lawyer stated that the case still required the arrest of the original offender and requested a postponement for further verification. Judge Miao questioned the defendants briefly and then ordered them to be returned to custody, granting a postponement for further verification.</p>
<h3>Marital Discord: Man and Woman Attempt Suicide by Poison; Man Saved, Woman Dies – Why Do So Many Women Commit Suicide?</h3>
<p>A week ago, at the Guangzhou Teahouse on Avenue Joffre, a young man and woman suddenly appeared at noon. They were seated by the waiters for a meal. After the meal, the staff noticed something strange about their expressions, as if they were in great pain. The teahouse immediately reported this to the Lou-ka-way police station. The two were taken to the Guangci Hospital. It was diagnosed that both had taken poison in an attempt to end their lives. After investigating their families, it was learned that the woman was named Ye Peiying and the man Yang Wenhui, both local residents. Ye was 22 years old, residing at No. 46 Yongxing Lane, Ganshi East Road. Yang was formerly employed at the Hollywood Amusement Park on Yu Yuan Road. The two met by chance and fell deeply in love, making a private marriage agreement. However, as is often the case with good intentions, this plan was discovered by the woman's parents, who strongly opposed it. The couple became disillusioned with life. That day, they went to the Guangzhou Teahouse to eat. Beforehand, they had both taken poison. When they were sent to the hospital for treatment, Yang was fortunate enough to be resuscitated. However, Ye had taken an overdose, and she died on the previous day.</p>
<p>Zhou Yuying, a 20-year-old local girl, residing at No. 12 Tai'an Lane, Rue Pichon, French Concession, Zhou Yuying, worked at the Tongyi Yarn Factory on Moganshan Road. Recently, she had been pursuing modern fashions, purchasing many new clothes. Her mother disapproved of her frivolous behavior and severely reprimanded her. In a fit of resentment, Zhou developed a desire to end her life. Around 8 PM the previous evening, she went alone to Room 537 of the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road, paid the room fee for the day, and then went out. She returned to the hotel around midnight and purchased raw opium, which she swallowed. She then locked the door and went to sleep. The night shift tea boy did not suspect anything until about 4:40 AM the next morning, when he heard moaning from the room. He reported this to the front desk, and they managed to break down the door. They found the girl lying on the bed, her face pale. Knowing that she had attempted suicide by poison, they urgently called the police and an ambulance to take her to Renji Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, she had not been poisoned for long, and her life was not in danger.</p>
<p>Lu Xiuzhen, a young woman residing at No. 72, Lane 411, Xin Dagu Road, Lu Xiu suddenly took a very sharp small knife at around 4:02 PM yesterday and stabbed her throat, attempting suicide. Her family caught sight of this and managed to wrest the blade from her grasp, but she was already covered in blood. They urgently called an ambulance to take her to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Her life is in great danger.</p>
<p>He Li Shi, a young woman residing at No. 4 Taozhu Lane, Jiujiang Road, He Li Shi, 25 years old, was deeply troubled because her husband was unemployed and the family was facing severe financial difficulties, making it difficult to maintain their daily life. In a fit of resentment, she secretly swallowed poisonous liquid at around 2:30 PM yesterday, attempting suicide. Her family noticed this and rushed her to Renji Hospital for treatment, where she was fortunately resuscitated.</p>
<h3>At the Sichuan Road Bridgehead: Loud Explosion, Two Injured by Shrapnel</h3>
<p>At around 3 PM yesterday, a bomb suddenly exploded at the Sichuan Road bridgehead, causing a loud noise. Two pedestrians were injured at the scene. Fortunately, they only suffered minor facial injuries. They went to Tongren Hospital on their own. After examination by doctors, they were discharged and returned home. The injured were identified as Chen Yu, 24 years old, who works as a cashier at the Liddell Ballroom on Jing'an Temple Road, and Wu Linsheng, 28 years old, from Ningbo, who works as a cashier at the Xinzha Hotel on Xinzha Road. According to Chen and others, they were riding trolleybus No. 17. When they got off at the Sichuan Road bridgehead they only went south a few steps when a sudden loud noise and black smoke appeared, and the iron flew every which way. Both of them only suffered scrapes to the face, and were fortunate that their injuries were minor and they were quickly no longer harmed.</p>
<h3>Northern Xin Jing Town Searched Yesterday; Over a Hundred Villagers Arrested</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 30th) morning, at about 9 AM, over a hundred plainclothes Japanese soldiers suddenly placed Xin Jing Town, northwest of Shanghai, under martial law. Large numbers of armed Japanese troops set up machine guns at the entrances and exits of the town, cutting off traffic. They entered the town to conduct searches. All teahouses, taverns, and pedestrians along the way were interrogated. At that time, the morning market had not yet closed, and the town was crowded with villagers. After strict searches by the Japanese army, over a hundred villagers were deemed to be acting suspiciously and were arrested and taken away in trucks towards Hongqiao. The Japanese army searched the town for about an hour before order was restored. All those arrested were innocent.</p>
<h3>Puppet Police Turn a Blind Eye: Bandits Run Rampant in Gaoqiao, Murdering and Robbing, Residents Anxious, Scholar's Family Robbed, Victim Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>Gaoqiao North Township, surrounded by water on three sides, is a remote and peaceful area. However, since this spring, a group of local ruffians, numbering over ten, have been gathering and robbing indiscriminately. On the night of February 25th, the families of Lao Wei, Yuan Baofa, and Huang Jinhuo were robbed of jewelry, rings, and clothing worth over 300 yuan. On March 3rd, Shen Guiqing of Cangfangtou was robbed of over 80 yuan, and his right foot was dislocated, preventing him from getting up to this day. On the night of the 14th, Dou Mengxing's family in Yejiajiao was robbed, losing over 200 yuan. His sixty-year-old mother and unemployed brother were beaten black and blue, their heads broken and bleeding. It is said that his mother has already died. On the night of the 24th, Song Fugui's family was robbed, reporting a loss of over 300 yuan. Song Fugui and his son-in-law were both seriously injured and unable to get up. On the night of the 25th, Zhu Risheng's family was robbed, his two sons injured, and two rings, three gold bracelets, and clothing were stolen, with a loss of over 400 yuan. On the night of the 26th, six families were robbed in Sanchagang, with losses in that area estimated at over 1,000 yuan. This group of bandits is so rampant that local residents are in a state of anxiety. The police officers in the puppet government's police station do not take any precautions before incidents occur, nor do they investigate after incidents, even if they occur nearby. It is clear that they are not protecting the people. (Another report) Lu Guixiang, a resident of Zhaitou Village, about three miles west of Gaoqiao Town, is nearly seventy years old and earns a living by teaching and farming. Although his family has been scholars for three generations and has a reputation for wealth, heavy expenses have left him with more appearance than substance. At around 10 PM the night before last, over ten bandits, each wielding a single-edged sword and iron bars, broke into his home. The men and women of the Lu family were awakened from their sleep and bound by the bandits, who confined them to a room. The bandits then searched the house, stealing clothing, cash, and gold and silver ornaments worth less than a hundred yuan. Dissatisfied, they beat Guixiang, demanding to know where the silver was hidden. However, apart from a small amount of cash that was stolen, there was nothing else hidden in Lu's home. The bandits did not believe him and tied a rope around Lu's neck, dragging him from room to room to search, and beating him with iron bars, leaving him covered in injuries and on the verge of death. Because they had not obtained anything significant, they were filled with resentment. They stabbed Guixiang three times in the neck before yelling and leaving. The Lu family members, seeing that the bandits had left, struggled to free themselves and inspected the rooms. They found Guixiang dead inside. The situation was tragic, but there was nothing they could do. They could only prepare a coffin and bury him. It is reported that the puppet police局 arrested seven bandits on Xiaosha Island yesterday and are currently interrogating them.</p>
<h3>Shooting Incident on Avenue Amiral Foch Yesterday Morning: Mr. Ping Shot at While Boarding Car; Multiple Shots Miss, Reason Unknown</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, an attempted assassination by shooting occurred on Avenue Amiral Foch in the French Concession. There were a total of three assailants. One was unarmed, apparently a lookout in the case. The other two fired at a man in his forties wearing a Western-style suit. The two assailants fired six or seven shots in total. Strangely, the man being pursued was very close to the assailants, only a foot or two away, but he was not hit. He escaped unscathed. The assailants, having exhausted their ammunition, fled. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Waiting for Car Owner</p>
<p>At about 9:45 AM yesterday, a purple-black private car with a black license plate, French Concession license number 7468, was parked at the No. 5 entrance along Avenue Amiral Foch (opposite the Jin Gu Cun apartments, near Rue du Père Froc). The front of the car faced west. The chauffeur sat in the car, waiting for the owner to board.</p>
<p>Assailants Emerge</p>
<p>Before long, a man in his forties wearing a deep yellow spring suit arrived. As he approached the car and reached for the door handle to open it, three assailants suddenly emerged from the corner of Rue du Père Froc. One was unarmed and signaled to the two armed assailants, who were wearing black coats and holding pistols.</p>
<p>Chase and Shoot</p>
<p>The two armed assailants quickly ran to the front of the car and opened fire on the man in the suit who was about to board. The man, seeing this, was shocked and quickly turned and fled west. The two assailants pursued him relentlessly, firing as they chased. They fired as many as six or seven shots, even at a distance of only a foot or two. However, the man was not injured.</p>
<p>Police Search</p>
<p>At the same time, the assailants seemed to have exhausted their ammunition and turned back and fled towards Rue du Père Froc. The man who was being pursued fled into the nearby Chinese Arts and Crafts Society. Nearby police officers heard the gunshots and quickly gathered from all directions. Seeing the man, they immediately reported to the Lou-ka-way police station. The chief of police, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the scene and conduct a search. After the Chinese and foreign detectives arrived, they searched for the assailants without success. They learned that the man's surname was Ping and that he had recently purchased car number 7468 from a friend in Shanghai and had been using it for several days. The police are currently investigating the reason for the assassination attempt.</p>
<h3>Fan Jingmei Found Not Guilty in False Accusation Case</h3>
<p>Fan Jingmei of the Yuanyuan Hat Shop on Wangping Street, Shandong Road, had previously filed a case with the Second Special Court against Wu Changlin and others of the Jixiang Street Hat Shop in the French Concession, accusing them of forgery, embezzlement, and breach of trust. The defendants were ordered to post bail of 1,000 yuan each. Subsequently, the Yuanyuan Hat Shop was suddenly splattered with excrement and received repeated threatening phone calls, becoming unbearable. They reported this to the General Police Station, which learned that the Chen Tianyi Hat Shop and Fan had a lawsuit. Chinese and Western detectives, together with French police, went to investigate the Chen Hat Shop. Xing Changlin, a partner in the shop, claimed that Fan had made false accusations and hired lawyers Fan Gang and Qian Xingzhong to file a criminal complaint with the First Special Court against Fan Jingmei for false accusation, submitting police records indicating accusations against Wu Changlin. After one hearing, the testimonies diverged, and the court rescheduled the hearing and ordered the investigating officer, Liu Qingsheng, to be summoned to testify. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng continued the hearing in Criminal Court I. The defendant hired lawyers Yue Junwei and He Yizhang to defend him. Detective Liu Qingsheng testified that he and a Western detective investigated the incident of Fan Jingmei being splattered with excrement. The reporter was named Fan Yushu. The police asked him if he had any feuds or personal grievances with the shop. The reporter said that he had a lawsuit with Chen Tianyi but did not specify who, etc. Then, the plaintiff, Wu Changlin, testified that Fan Yushu was the defendant and that the defendant, Fan Jingmei, said that Fan Yushu was the accountant of the Yuanyuan Hat Shop and had already been brought to court for questioning. The court, deeming the case clear, ordered the debate to begin. After mutual arguments by the lawyers of both parties, Judge Huang ruled Fan Jingmei not guilty.</p>

<h3>Wife and Three Children Accuse Husband of Abandonment, Side-wife and Three Children without Support, Defendant Absent from Yesterday's Hearing, Further Summons Pending</h3>
<p>Cai Ling Shu Ying, a Suzhou woman residing in a small room at No. 49 Caishi Road, French Concession, is thirty-two years old. She previously married Cai Bohua, son of the former Shanghai magistrate Cai Hefu, as a concubine. She has two sons, the elder named En Guan, seven years old this year, and the younger named Yuan Guan, four years old. On August 20, 1937, Bohua died of illness. Ling and her two sons</p>
<p>Observed the Funeral Rites. Unexpectedly, Cai Shi Xiuqing, the wife of Cai Bohua, and Gan Shousun and Shou Kang and the others deny that Ling's two sons are Bohua's sons. Therefore, Ling hired lawyers Fan Gang and Ying Shi to represent her and filed a petition with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, requesting confirmation of their identities. On June 25, 1938, the judge ruled that Cai En Guan and Cai Yuan Guan were confirmed as Bohua's sons. Since the verdict in the case, Cai Shi and her sons</p>
<p>Have Ignored Them and Not Provided Support, causing Ling and her three sons to have no means of support. Their applications to enter refugee camps were rejected. Helpless, they were temporarily staying in a small room belonging to relatives. On one hand, they still hired lawyers Fan Gang, Ying Shi, and Yu Enliang to represent them and filed a lawsuit with the Central Police Station of the French Concession against Cai Shi Xiuqing, Cai Shousun, and Cai Shou Kang, accusing them of abandonment. They requested that they be prosecuted according to Article 293 of the Criminal Law, in addition to</p>
<p>Adding a Civil Suit. Cai Ling requested a monthly calculation of 40 yuan for her portion. From her current age of thirty-two to sixty years old, a total of twenty-eight years, totaling 13,540 yuan. Cai En Guan, seven years old, has monthly educational expenses of 30 yuan, calculated to the age of twenty, thirteen years remaining, totaling 4,680 yuan. Cai Yuan Guan, four years old, has monthly educational expenses of 30 yuan, calculated to the age of twenty, sixteen years remaining, totaling 5,760 yuan. The above living expenses are the minimum and should be borne by the defendants, etc. The police chief</p>
<p>Sent Detectives to Summon the Defendants. Since the defendants could not be summoned, the plaintiffs were summoned to Criminal Court I of the Second Special Court yesterday afternoon. The police lawyer first stated the case and requested verification, claiming that the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, Ying Shi, stated that the defendants were indeed residing in Room 18, Yang's Apartment Building, No. 6 Hualong Road, and deliberately refused to appear in court. Moreover, Cai Shoukang is a well-known doctor and should be issued a warrant by the court for investigation. Judge Miao Qingbang ruled to summon the defendants for further inquiry.</p>

<h3>Murder by Jealousy, Body Abandoned: Adulterer Confesses to the Crime, Zhang Er, the Woman, is Still at Large, Brother Ordered to Turn Her In</h3>
<p>Zhang Er, a young woman from Funing who previously lived in a bungalow on Yuan Road, Yangshupu, became acquainted with Pang Kaibao, a fellow villager working as a road laborer, last winter. They often met for secret rendezvous. Later, her husband, Bao Youqing, discovered this and questioned her. Unexpectedly, Zhang and Pang Kaibao conspired to preempt him. On the morning of the 21st of last month, while Bao Youqing was asleep, Pang Kaibao sneaked into the bedroom and axed Bao to death. They carried the body to a nearby wasteland and threw it into a pond. When tying the corpse with rope, they tied a tin bucket of stone to the end to make it sink. The case was solved by Chinese detectives Guo Jingbang and Ji Xiucheng of the Yangshupu police station, who arrested the murderer Pang Kaibao and handed him over to the First Special District Local Court. Zhang Er, the woman, is at large. She was ordered to be sent back, but Zhang could not be apprehended.

<h3>Husband's Health and the Relationship to Eugenics</h3>
<p>Like father, like son.</p>
<p>Because of scientific advancements, we now know that a person's language, actions, thoughts, and entire life are shaped by two factors: nature and nurture. Improving the environment depends on the spread of education, and improving nature requires efforts in eugenics. In this era of national revival, the most fundamental and thorough approach is to promote universal education urgently, but we believe that measures to improve national traits should be given at least as much attention as education.</p>
<p>Like father, like son. When it comes to eugenics, the father's health and intelligence are most important. Someone studied the family line of the great scientist Darwin and found that sixteen famous scientists appeared in five generations from his grandfather onwards. "The son of a general is always a general." Courage and physical strength also have considerable influence in inheritance. Indeed, a healthy and robust man, once married to a beautiful and graceful woman, will surely have a deep love, a sweet family, and a happy life, and their children will also be intelligent and lively and develop healthily. If a family has wise and strong descendants, even if the family is relatively poor, the future prospects are limitless! At the same time, how comforting this is to their parents! As the saying goes: "Poverty without wealth is not poverty, poverty without children is true poverty, having sick and weak children is like owing a debt." However, most fathers are unaware of this. They either commit self-harm and nocturnal emissions in their early years, or indulge in excessive sexual activity after marriage, or, due to other worries and overwork, deplete their bodies, leaving them outwardly strong but inwardly weak, frail, or even suffering from neurasthenia, brain swelling, headaches, dull thinking, forgetfulness, insomnia, back pain, limb fatigue, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, thin sperm, infertility, and other symptoms. As a result, they cannot lead a fulfilling life with their wives and are hated by them, their love fades, and if they have sons or daughters, they are often weak or die young, or even remain childless, causing lifelong regret! Therefore, the father's weakness not only deprives him of his own happiness but also affects his descendants. At the same time, it is also deeply and significantly related to the nation and the country! To seek remedies, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, it is generally recognized that taking the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Shengzhis" is the most effective treatment. This agent can produce sperm, tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain, invigorate blood circulation, and nourish nerves after taking it. If you continue to take it, you will be able to fully recover early and achieve the effects of prolonging life and rejuvenating. Only those who have nocturnal emissions need to take "Ximitu's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" at the same time to consolidate the sperm gate and prevent leakage, then the effect will be even faster.</p>
<p>Beauty</p>
<h3>The Scientific Remedy for Shrunken Breasts</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Around the time a girl experiences her first menstruation, her physiology undergoes a transformation. A sallow complexion gains a rosy hue. Embarrassing soft hairs begin to grow in the armpits and pubic region. Hips that were not very full become more so. And the pair of breasts on her chest gradually become firm and erect, like balloons being inflated. A gaze like autumn water, when encountering a strange man, shyly glances at him. A welcoming smile constantly appears on her face. Her temperament and tone of voice become gentle. Her gestures and demeanor shed the form of a young girl, and exhibit the unique poise of a "virgin."</p>
<p>How beautiful a virgin truly is! But this period is the most dangerous for a woman, despite its mystery and loveliness! Because physiological changes and surging desires easily lead those with weak wills to indulge in masturbation. The most common adverse effect is menstrual irregularity, or even amenorrhea. This leads to a multitude of ailments, causing the breasts, which govern female health, to become severely shrunken, ovarian function becomes abnormally weakened, metabolic processes lose their ability to nourish, muscles become wasted, and the complexion becomes haggard. Not only will they inevitably fail in the competition for beauty, but they will also develop frigidity and infertility once they enter into marital relations, and be hated by their husbands. Happiness will be non-existent. The only remedy, according to famous Chinese and foreign gynecologists and my own experience, is to take the ovarian preparation "Shengzhisu" (Reproductive Element), which is most effective for the condition. This preparation is exquisitely formulated. Taking it for just one day and night can nourish ovarian function, invigorate metabolism, regulate menstruation, and warm the uterus to stop leukorrhea. Continued use can not only cure various hidden female diseases but also make the breasts erect, the cheeks rosy, and youthfulness lasting.</p>
<h3>A Self-Help Plan for Young Men with Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nian-zeng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>According to doctors, the reason why many young men suffer from nocturnal emission is primarily due to masturbation. It not only wastes the most precious reproductive fluids in the body, but also causes great damage to the nerves. Therefore, those who masturbate often suffer from neurasthenia. Because of neurasthenia, the sphincter of the vas deferens is often in a state of hypersensitivity, or even loses its function, so nocturnal emission erupts.</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission is a terrible scourge for young men. Frequent nocturnal emission will inevitably exacerbate neurasthenia. As a result, symptoms such as insufficient brainpower, sluggish thinking, forgetfulness, insomnia, tinnitus, blurred vision, timidity and anxiety, depression, lower back pain, body fatigue, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and impotence will follow. Furthermore, due to the depletion of essence and blood, developmental functions are hindered, leading to incomplete development, with the penis being as short as a finger, or insufficient sperm production, leading to a lack of sperm or even none at all, resulting in thin semen and infertility. Such men are not only hated by their wives for their inability to enjoy sexual relations, but if their wives are strong-willed and cunning, they may engage in adultery, elope, or sue for divorce, which is a common occurrence in today's society. Even if their wives sob quietly and try to maintain the family, the children born are often weak. The mother worries about the children's illnesses, and what joy is there in the family? As for infertility and the lack of descendants, it will bring lifelong regret!</p>
<p>The remedy for nocturnal emission today is to take "Ximituo's Solid Essence Pills," which are most effective. This medicine, after being taken, can strengthen the sphincter, calm the nerves, reduce dreams, and promote sleep, so nocturnal emission can be cured. If nocturnal emission has already caused the above symptoms, "Shengzhisu" (Reproductive Element), a preparation of gonadotropin, should be taken to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continued use can restore health as soon as possible. However, if the patient can come to my clinic for a diagnosis by a specialist, the use of electrotherapy, injections, surgery, and other methods can guarantee a cure.</p>

<p>Common people think that once leukorrhea bacteria enter the posterior urethra, their disease is hopeless. This is certainly an overreaction. Others believe that before leukorrhea invades the sexual organs, the gonococci will never invade the posterior urethra, and therefore boldly disregard it, which is a big mistake. In short, in the acute stage of gonorrhea, the gonococci are mostly concentrated in the anterior urethra in the first two or three days. If one can strictly adhere to health preservation methods and use scientific methods for treatment, the gonococci can be easily eliminated. Otherwise, they will not immediately invade the posterior urethra. However, if one does not observe health preservation and is treated by incompetent doctors who recklessly perform inappropriate surgeries, the gonococci will be stimulated by these bad treatments and take advantage of the opportunity to enter, often invading the posterior urethra within two or three days and causing various symptoms, which is something that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Once gonorrhea enters the posterior urethra, various complications will follow, the most obvious being gonorrheal cystitis, prostatitis, orchitis, nephritis, etc. Therefore, many patients are terrified when they learn that gonorrhea has spread to the posterior urethra. However, based on my experience, the various symptoms caused by posterior urethritis are not to be feared. Taking gonorrheal prostatitis as an example, this symptom is the most likely to occur in gonorrhea, and the treatment is the most complicated. Most doctors only know about electrotherapy, massage, and oral medicine, but they do not know that in addition to these, I always use warm water enemas and cooling methods. When it suppurates, I immediately use quick surgery to cut open the perineum to drain the pus, so that it can heal and be cured in a short period of time. Otherwise, if prostatitis has already suppurated and the patient is still allowed to suffer, it will lead to a prostatic fistula that will never be cured. This is all the fault of the doctor. However, most doctors dare not perform this because of their poor surgical skills. To become a famous gonorrhea doctor, one must be bold and meticulous. Consultation hours: 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>Specialty: Also treats syphilis, buboes, chancres, and painless new method for circumcision.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I am writing on behalf of my client, Huang Shuying, who stated that he recently read a news item in the news column of the Shenshi and Liangbao on the 28th of this month, titled "Doctor Yu Tingxiang Sues for Medical Expenses." The news item stated that Yu Tingxiang, a doctor at the Hua'an Insurance Company on Jing'an Temple Road, instructed lawyer Qian Yuzhong to file a lawsuit in the Second Special Court's Civil Division against Huang Shuying, an employee of the Huafeng Industrial Company on Fada Road, alleging that from August 23 to September 22, 1938, Huang Shuying received treatment for leukorrhea, syphilis, and neck sores from Yu Tingxiang, totaling 14 yuan for consultations. Despite repeated attempts to collect the payment, Huang Shuying refused to pay and even used abusive language. Therefore, Yu Tingxiang requested the court to summon Huang Shuying for questioning. The court approved the request and issued a summons, but the defendant failed to appear. The plaintiff's attorney presented the case, and Judge Ma Yishu ordered the defendant to be summoned again for questioning. However, this is inconsistent with the facts. My client did seek treatment from Dr. Yu for an illness, but it was not for venereal diseases. As for the consultation fees, they were all paid in full, with no arrears. Moreover, the medicines required were all prepared by my client himself. The allegations made by the doctor are mostly fabricated and damage my client's reputation. Therefore, I am writing to request a correction to clarify the situation and protect my client's reputation. In addition to sending a separate letter, I am also sending this letter to be published. Please investigate and publish this letter. Sincerely, Wan Weijian, Lawyer, March 30.</p>
<p>To the Editor: I read today's newspaper, which reported on a fire on Hankou Road and Guangxi Road in which many people were burned to death. It stated that firefighters pulled out three corpses with their bare hands, and acquaintances identified them as employees of Lao Rongtai. This is inconsistent with the facts. The fire started next door to our store and spread to our store. Fortunately, all the staff in the store escaped safely and were not injured. We are afraid of confusing the public, so we are writing to request a correction. Sincerely, Lao Rongtai Powder Bureau, March 29.</p>

<p>Chinese Medicine and Dietary Therapy</p>
<h3>Intestinal Parasitic Diseases in Children</h3>
<p>— Zhu Zuosan</p>
<p>Seven or eight out of ten malnourished children suffer from parasitic diseases. The types of parasites vary, but they are generally caused by improper diet, raw and cold vegetables and fruits, or undercooked fish, shrimp, and meat, allowing parasite eggs to be transmitted. Excessive consumption of fatty and sweet foods leads to damp heat and stagnation, causing the parasites to breed and multiply endlessly. Affected children will inevitably have reduced appetite, fail to gain muscle, vomit clear water, and experience abdominal pain that comes and goes, sometimes becoming unbearable. Their complexion will be sallow, and their philtrum will have a bluish tinge. If left untreated, their nutrition will continue to decline, and they will become increasingly emaciated.</p>
<p>In the early stages of parasitic diseases, one should be cautious about diet. Vegetables and meat must be cooked thoroughly, and snacks must be avoided. Aromatic foods should not be given. Even beans should be fried with Sichuan peppercorns. Torreya seeds (commonly known as Xiangfei) have the function of killing parasites and harmonizing the spleen. Taking six or seven seeds daily, boiled in sugar water, on an empty stomach in the morning can eliminate parasites. Or, they can be soaked and cooked with the shell and eaten at any time. They are sweet and delicious and can also kill parasites. Quisqualis indica is also a common medicine for expelling parasites. Eating six or seven seeds daily can lubricate the intestinal walls, so that the parasites have nothing to attach to and are excreted from the body. For expelling parasites, the ancient formula Wumei Wan is the authoritative treatment for ascarids. Huachong Wan and Zhuichong Wan are also special formulas for treating parasites. Although the indications of the ingredients such as ume, centipeda minima, ulmus davidiana, betel nut, and toosendan radix differ, their parasite-killing effects are definite. They have a chemical or physical effect on the parasites, causing them to be anesthetized or corroded to death after exposure. Another method is to decoct five qian of pomegranate root bark (fresh is best, pomegranate fruit peel is ineffective) with three qian of betel nut in a concentrated juice, add a little white sugar, and take it on an empty stomach, which can be quite effective. However, this type of oral deworming agent should be taken on an empty stomach, or even after eating a little roasted meat or sweets to stimulate the parasites' appetite and make them more susceptible to the medicine. After taking the medicine, a mild laxative should be used as an adjuvant.</p>
<h3>Malnutrition</h3>
<p>— Chen Jiazhen</p>
<p>Among children's diseases, malnutrition is the most common. The reason is nothing more than excessive consumption of miscellaneous foods such as candies and cakes, which leads to weakness of the spleen and stomach, digestive disorders, and stagnation of undigested food in the stomach and intestines, causing the cessation of the body's metabolic functions. Over time, worms grow in the intestines, and the food eaten daily is used to feed the worms. As a result, the number of roundworms in the intestines increases day by day, while the body's muscles gradually become thin. Blue veins appear on the abdomen, or it becomes swollen and distended. Even the muscles of the limbs become increasingly thin, resulting in malnutrition. If children want to prevent this disease, in addition to avoiding miscellaneous foods, they can eat four or five Quisqualis indica seeds daily, or seven or eight seeds for severe cases. Quisqualis indica is the Western medicine anthelmintic santonin, which is most effective in killing worms and eliminating malnutrition. It can gradually clear the parasites in the intestines, and the method of taking it is simple and easy to follow.</p>
<h3>Colds Require Dietary Restrictions</h3>
<p>— Chen Weicang</p>
<p>Colds are prevalent in all seasons, but especially in spring and winter. Although they are mild, they can linger and change, so knowledge of dietary restrictions is essential. A brief description is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Avoid Fatty Meats: Fatty meats are greasy and nourishing, which can help keep the membrane intact. In cases of colds, this will cause the body to lose its ability to eliminate toxins and prevent wind and cold from being expelled, causing body temperature to accumulate on the surface and easily leading to fever.</p>
<p>(2) Avoid Fishy Foods: When the lungs are bound by wind, their ability to diffuse and descend is impaired, resulting in coughing. Although coughing is a natural defense mechanism of the body to protect against external harm, it ultimately consumes energy and damages the collaterals. Fishy foods can irritate the lungs and cause them to lose their ability to resist automatically, leading to aggravation and causing sore throats, hoarseness, and respiratory pain.</p>
<p>(3) Eating Spicy Foods: Symptoms such as blood in the sputum should be avoided. One should not ignore minor illnesses.</p>
<h3>Records of Exotic Things from the Wilderness</h3>
<p>— Fang Shen'an</p>
<p>When I was a child, I followed my father, who was an official in Sichuan, and traveled throughout the border areas of Sichuan and Tibet. The abundance of products, rare birds and animals, and exotic flowers and plants were everywhere. The production of medicinal materials was especially abundant, with many exotic varieties. I will record two of the things I remember below to supplement what is not included in the Compendium of Materia Medica and to provide reference for naturalists.</p>
<p>(1) Fritillaria Chicken</p>
<p>Fritillaria, also known as "Meng," is mentioned in the Mao Poems as "Xiao Caiqi Meng." In the Erya, it is written as "Meng," pronounced "Mang." Those produced in Sichuan are the best, and those near Kangding and Tibet that are large are the top grade. In spring and summer, it blooms with beautiful purple flowers. Its functions are recorded in the Compendium of Materia Medica, so I will not repeat them.</p>
<p>Kangding and Tibet have many mountains, and there are many unknown rare birds and animals. The Fritillaria Chicken is one type of bird, resembling a mountain chicken, with a high crown and long tail, and feathers that are colorful and patterned. Even the Golden Pheasant and Peacock cannot compare. It lives in the high mountains and only eats Fritillaria, hence the name Fritillaria Chicken. When caught and eaten, the meat is fatty, tender, and delicate. The locals consider it to be a top-grade delicacy and a top-grade tonic. Unfortunately, its production is small, and it flies quickly, making it difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>(2) Qianghuo Fish</p>
<p>Qianghuo is produced in Qiangdi, and is also found in Kangding and Tibet. The stems and leaves are covered with fine hairs. In summer, the stems grow tall, and the leaves are feathery. In autumn, it blooms with small, light green five-petaled flowers and bears purple fruits. When strong winds blow, the wild grasses undulate like waves, but the Qianghuo does not move, so it can dispel wind when used in medicine. The locals see it and dig under its roots to find a bowl-sized pool of water with two small fish. However, not every plant has this. If it is found, it is sold in the market. For symptoms of colds, it is boiled and eaten. Sweating will relieve the symptoms, making it a miraculous product for inducing sweating.</p>
<h3>Replenishment is Needed After Excessive Blood Loss: Dietary Therapy for "Blood in the Stool"</h3>
<p>— Ding Bo'an</p>
<p>Blood is essential to the human body. Lack of blood will inevitably affect all parts of the body. Acute blood loss, if excessive, will make it impossible for us to continue our lives. Therefore, vomiting blood and nosebleeds are considered serious diseases. Although the symptoms of blood in the stool are less severe than vomiting blood, they can still harm the health of the human body, so they should also be treated and nourished.</p>
<p>Blood in the stool is bleeding from the anus. When discharged, it may be mixed with the stool, or before the stool, or after the stool, or it may be discharged like water spraying from a bamboo tube, with abdominal pain and tenesmus. The blood color may be bright red, purplish-brown, or black. In addition, there are also hemorrhoids bleeding, prolonged dysentery bleeding, intestinal wind bleeding, and trauma bleeding. All of these fall within the scope of blood in the stool, and the treatment methods are similar. The source of blood in the stool is actually due to damp heat flowing into the large intestine, causing heat to accumulate and steam. There are two methods of food therapy: (1) One he of japonica rice and three dried persimmons (available at South goods stores), cut into small pieces, and cook into a thin porridge with the rice. Serve as breakfast every morning, which can be quite effective. Persimmons have a sweet, mild, and astringent nature, which can strengthen the spleen, astringe the intestines, cool the blood, and stop bleeding. Eating it strengthens the absorption capacity of the intestinal blood vessels, not only treating blood in the stool, but also treating hemoptysis. (2) In the past, someone suffered from dysentery with blood in the stool, which recurred three times after recovery. The doctor ordered him to stop taking medicine and eat three crabapples (i.e., flower red) daily. The blood in the stool was cured after two weeks, and it never recurred after eating them for a month. Crabapples contain a lot of acidic juice, which enters the stomach and increases gastric juice to aid digestion. It is absorbed into the blood by the intestinal walls, increasing the blood's coagulation ability and eliminating inflammation of the stomach and intestines. Therefore, it is also effective in treating blood in the stool.</p>
<h3>Dietary Discussion (3)</h3>
<p>— Qin Bowei</p>
<p>8. Liu Yi San (Six-One Powder): For clearing summer heat, it is best to wrap Liu Yi San in fresh lotus leaves, pierce small holes with a needle, and brew with boiling water. Liu Yi San is a mixture of talc powder and licorice root, which not only detoxifies and relieves fever but also promotes urination. Lotus leaves have a cleansing effect. Children in summer often develop acne and itching, so they should drink more of this. Alternatively, brewing fresh bamboo leaves and gypsum to drink has a similar effect, but it is too strong and can easily cause problems.</p>
<p>Soda Water, Fresh Orange Juice, and Floral Water: Soda water is the most popular drink on the market in summer. Its main ingredients are baking soda and citric acid, which can harmonize the middle and soothe the Qi. Fresh orange juice can cleanse the stomach and moisten the intestines. Both help digestion and are good for quenching thirst. However, drinkers must add ice, and often drink it when they are hot from labor. It is like pouring cold water on a bright furnace fire. Can the human body not react when suddenly stimulated? This is worth noting. In my opinion, China has excellent summer drinks, but they are classified as medicinal and not widely used. That is, floral water. Floral water is made by distillation, with pure materials and aromatic fragrance. In short, Qinghao dew can clear heat, Borneol dew can relieve summer heat, Lycium chinense root bark dew can eliminate heat, faba bean flower dew can stop bleeding, fresh rice leaf dew can harmonize the stomach, Rosa multiflora dew can soothe the Qi, and Eriobotrya japonica leaf dew can moisten the lungs. Lonicera japonica dew can clear heat and detoxify, and lotus flower dew can relieve summer heat and eliminate restlessness, which are especially suitable for cooling off in summer. If they can be promoted in the same way as soda water and fresh orange juice, it would be of great benefit.</p>
<p>10. Rice: Regarding food, rice and wheat are the main staples in China. Rice is divided into japonica and glutinous rice: In addition to moisture, japonica rice is richest in protein, followed by fat, and then ash. It can strengthen the body and make people fat. It is sweet and neutral, tonifying the spleen and stomach, as well as other organs. It generates Qi, blood, meridians, and essence, making them abundant. It strengthens the tendons, bones, muscles, and skin. The Compendium of Materia Medica describes it as stopping restlessness, thirst, and diarrhea, which are secondary effects. There are differences in the timing of planting and harvesting, as well as the location where it is grown. Early rice is slightly warm in nature, while late rice is slightly cool. Rice from high altitudes is hard and clean, while rice from low-lying areas is moist and yin in nature. Winter and spring rice is not sticky, and Xiangjing rice has a unique fragrance. Cooking it after illness harmonizes and invigorates the stomach, which is especially good. Although glutinous rice also tonifies the lungs and strengthens the spleen, it is warm and sticky in nature, difficult to digest, and excessive consumption makes people sleepy, weak, unable to control their limbs, and prone to wind and confusion. Children, the sick, and pregnant women should all avoid it.</p>
<p>11. Noodles: Noodles are made from wheat, which has the same properties as potatoes and contains a large amount of lime, which is an essential element for the formation of bone mass. Wheat is the best food for the growth of young people's bodies because it contains lime. Wheat is sweet and neutral in nature, thickens the stomach and intestines, strengthens Qi, tonifies deficiency, helps the five organs, and its effects are no less than those of rice. However, Southerners dislike it because it causes thirst and dampness, generates phlegm, and moves Qi. Therefore, adults with damp heat in the spleen and stomach, and children with food accumulation and malnutrition are all forbidden to eat it. However, Northerners use it as a substitute for rice and do not suffer from it, which is related to the high and dry terrain and the lack of damp heat.</p>
<h3>Throat Diseases are Prevalent, Pay Attention to Dietary Therapy</h3>
<p>— Cao Xiwan</p>
<p>This spring, there have been continuous rains and abnormal weather, so those who are sick are everywhere. Among them, throat diseases are the most prominent. The throat is located in an important position in the human body, controlling the hub of breathing and eating. Therefore, there are many dangers when the throat is sick. In addition to appropriate treatment, attention should be paid to the adjustment of dietary therapy. The general principles of dietary therapy for throat diseases are described below for the reference of the public:</p>
<p>(1) Appropriate Dietary Therapy Products:</p>
<p>(1) Salt Soup: Salt has the function of purging heat, clearing blood, moisturizing dryness, and unblocking the two bowels. It is excellent for making a drink and gargling.</p>
<p>(2) White Radish: White radishes are sweet, neutral, and slightly cold in nature. They have the function of clearing phlegm heat. They can be eaten raw or shredded and served as a side dish.</p>
<p>(3) Aged Jellyfish: Jellyfish is salty, neutral, and slightly cold in nature. It can resolve phlegm and clear blood. Aged jellyfish is purer in nature. It is truly a wonderful product when used as a side dish.</p>
<p>(4) Olive: It is sweet, clear, sour, and neutral in nature. It can clear the lungs, invigorate the stomach, lower Qi, eliminate vexation, benefit the throat, and generate body fluids. It can be eaten raw or decocted.</p>
<p>(5) Yali Pear: It is sweet, full, slightly sour in nature. It can cool the heart, moisten the lungs, resolve phlegm, lower fire, clear the throat, moisten dryness, and benefit the large and small intestines. It is suitable for eating raw. (However, because it is too cooling, it is not suitable for symptoms of rotten throat and measles "Western name scarlet fever," which should be permeable but not cooling.)</p>
<p>(2) Foods to Avoid</p>
<p>All sour, spicy, fresh, pungent, greasy, fried, and all stimulating foods are taboo.</p>
<h3>The Long-Invented Chinese Organ Therapy (5)</h3>
<p>— Xie Yenong</p>
<p>Deer Velvet: Deer belong to yang animals. Their essence is concentrated in the velvet. The velvet is the fleshy substance with horn-like shape before the young deer has grown antlers. It is said that the best velvet is taken from the head of a live deer. Its nature is sweet and warm. It functions to generate essence, benefit marrow, nourish blood, and tonify yang deficiency in the human body. It is most suitable and effective for men with excessive sexual desire, nocturnal emission due to spermatorrhea, deficiency-cold sperm, soft bones and fatigue, and for women with insufficient blood, uterine deficiency-cold, lower abdominal cold pain, and amenorrhea. The so-called "yang deficiency" is a hypothetical term for a type of disease. In short, it refers to a condition of aversion to cold, pale complexion, impotence, weakness of the lower back and spine, and weakness of the feet and knees, caused by factors such as weakened cardiac pumping power, slow blood circulation, weakened nerve function, and reduced body temperature. This phenomenon is especially common in the elderly. Deer velvet has the effects of stimulating, strengthening, warming, and tonifying, so it is an effective medicine for tonifying deficiency and strengthening yang. For administration, take two fen of blood velvet slices each time, with six spoons of water, put them together in a bowl and stew them on the rice cooker until the soup is very thick. Only drink the soup. The undissolved velvet can be stewed and drunk again with added water. For impotence, soak deer velvet in aged rice wine and drink it. Elderly people often take it every winter for significant tonic benefits.</p>
<p>Chicken Gizzard: Reduced appetite and sluggish stomach often lead to illness. After various fevers, when the illness is initially subsiding but the stomach qi has not recovered, the patient also shows a lack of appetite. Chicken gizzard has a delicious taste and is a wonderful product for strengthening the spleen and awakening the stomach. Eating it when not sick and after illness can increase appetite and aid digestion, resulting in many benefits. When cooking, it must be crushed or sliced, and it is especially good when cooked with winter bamboo shoots. The inner layer of the chicken gizzard, also known as chicken gizzard lining, is tough and golden yellow in color, hence the name "chicken inner gold." This substance has a great effect on eliminating food and removing stagnation, and it also treats acid reflux. Observe that chickens often eat magnetic chips and brick particles and can digest them, which is because this substance is rich in digestive enzymes. If you eat too much and feel a stuffy pain in your abdomen, decoct chicken inner gold and drink the soup to get immediate relief. For infantile malnutrition and food accumulation, or malaria caused by food injury, decoct chicken gizzard lining and hawthorn meat and administer it. For vomiting and acid reflux, bake chicken inner gold until it retains its nature, grind it into powder, and mix it with milk to drink.</p>

<h3>The So-Called "Glorious Peace"</h3>
<p>— Maolie</p>
<p>Franco's 200,000 troops entered Madrid without firing a shot. The "glorious peace" of the National Defense Government has been achieved as desired. From now on, we have an even clearer understanding of the true meaning of "glorious peace"!</p>
<p>Since the National Defense Government was lured by benefits and forced by power to expel Negrin, it has been engaged in "glorious peace." At that time, what we understood was conditional surrender. However, Mussolini, Franco's backer, did not agree, believing that surrender should be simply surrender, without conditions. Therefore, after the National Defense Government tried its best to expel the Communist Party, seeing that the situation had gone, and there was nothing they could do, they surrendered and gave up Madrid. They may have been thinking that Franco would allow them to withdraw safely, without intercepting or pursuing them, and that they had indeed achieved "glorious peace." But what we understand at this time is unconditional surrender, which is "shameless surrender."</p>
<p>The Spanish matter has been settled. No matter which side is the actor and who is pulling the strings behind the scenes, everyone can breathe a sigh of relief. However, in the Far East, we have repeatedly heard the term "glorious peace." What is going on?</p>
<p>Previously, the ambassadors of certain countries had advised us to accept "glorious peace." We knew that this was surrender, at most with some conditions attached, and we did not agree; we continued to resist. Since then, this "glorious peace" has also been voiced in various places and in the mouths of certain colonists. We either ignored it or refuted it vehemently, and the sound dissipated and gradually disappeared. Now, it seems that some powerful people want to sing this old tune again, "glorious peace," to maintain their own interests. Looking at Spain, thinking about ourselves, we will not abandon our previous efforts, be fooled by them, and accept it!</p>
<p>The rhetoric of those who intend to lure and force us is predictable: you have fought for so long, you are really brave, and the whole world admires you; if you are willing to "peace," this "peace" is "glorious," and we will definitely help you with reconstruction afterwards. This is the lure. If you don't agree and continue to act recklessly, then sorry, we can't help ourselves and won't help you; take care of yourselves. This is the force. In short, they want us to stop resisting our enemies.</p>
<p>So the so-called "glorious peace" is "shameless surrender"! We have recognized it very clearly; we don't want "glorious peace," we want "complete victory"!</p>
<h3>Duel with Little Mussolini</h3>
<p>— Written by Edwin C. Parsons, Translated by Dabeng</p>
<p>On September 28, 1937, American volunteer in the Spanish government army, Patrick Dickinson, engaged in an aerial duel with Bruno Mussolini, the eldest son of Mussolini. Below is Dickinson's report.</p>
<p>I fought in Spain for a total of sixteen months. In the fall of 1937, I was the leader of the "Red Wings" team in Castellón. At that time, Little Mussolini commanded a squadron of the National Army Air Force, stationed in Palma, opposite us.</p>
<p>It was at the end of August that one evening, I learned from my superior, Colonel Reyes, that Mussolini had broadcast on the National Army radio, personally challenging five aircraft of the government army. This may have been a method Mussolini used to encourage morale, but unexpectedly, the duel finally materialized.</p>
<p>At that time, I immediately sent a telegram, willing to fight Mussolini alone. Later, I sent telegrams urging it, and finally, thirty days later, I received the following reply:</p>
<p>Captain Dickinson's proposal is accepted. It is agreed to engage in a solo battle at noon on September 28, at the center of the two armies' bases, at an altitude of 15,000 feet. Each side will bring two observation planes, which are absolutely not allowed to participate in the battle. After the two sides meet, they will make a round turn to indicate the start of the battle. When one side admits defeat, it can tie its gloves to a long scarf and throw it out. Please agree to abide by the above points, Mr. Dickinson. Bruno Mussolini.</p>
<p>After that, I did not make any special preparations. My plane was a Soviet Boeing P.26, with 1,050 horsepower, equipped with four twin-barreled Vickers machine guns and two electrically controlled machine guns on the wings.</p>
<p>That day arrived, and four companions took off first in two observation planes. A quarter of an hour later, I also mustered my courage and advanced towards Palma.</p>
<p>It was noon, and four observation planes were circling above me. On the National Army's side, a black dot appeared. That was Little Mussolini, coming in a 1,300-horsepower monoplane.</p>
<p>We flew in a circle at the same time and turned again, and then the melee began. What I saw was the sparks from the enemy's machine guns, what I heard was the sharp cry of bullets passing by my ears, and what I felt was the vibration of bullets hitting the wings. We met each other head-on, engaging at close quarters within a few inches.</p>
<p>The two planes separated, followed by semicircular rolls, at a very close distance. I could clearly distinguish the features on Mussolini's face. I took a breath, turned the fuselage, and moved forward to engage.</p>
<p>The next fifteen minutes were even more tense, because the various movements were too fast, and I could hardly remember clearly. But for every action I took, he had the same or better one. The enemy's plane had 250 more horsepower than mine, so speed helped him a lot.</p>
<p>My plane was shaking very badly. Soviet planes could not add excessive weight and horsepower, which affected my purpose a lot.</p>
<p>Ascending, descending, circling, rolling, these were continuous actions in a few seconds. The speed of the sliding caused the blood vessels in my limbs to stagnate, and the air hit my body without any slack. The sound of the engine and machine guns numbed my brain until I lost my hearing.</p>
<p>In my experience, I had never been the target of so many bullets.</p>
<p>We were descending—14,000 feet, 11,000, 8,000... Our observation planes were also circling and watching.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I found a wound on my left arm, and blood was spurting out, so I immediately descended. This was actually a mistake, because Mussolini was right behind me, pouring his lead bullets!</p>
<p>I tried my best to balance myself, stopped the forward movement of the engine, slid sideways, and waited for the enemy plane to rush over to strike it. This time I saw that I hit him, because his plane swayed. Afterwards, I heard that his leg was injured (although we could not confirm it), I thought it was at this time. But within a second, he came back again.</p>
<p>5,000 feet, 4,000, 3,000. Eighteen minutes, twenty minutes, we continued to fight. At that time, I was hungry and tired, the bullets broke my instruments, and the glass hit my face. I thought I was going to fail. But I seized the last chance and untied my scarf at the same time.</p>
<p>I pretended to be circling, turned to the top. At that time, I was a large target for him. I reduced myself to the smallest position, expecting the lead bullets to smash my body, but the result was no. After I turned around, I got the opportunity. The target of the enemy plane was as big as a house to my machine guns. My heart beat even harder when my fingers started to fire the machine guns. Then I saw his hand raised, and a black object was thrown out of his plane, spreading out a white tail, a scarf and gloves!</p>
<p>I was happy that he didn't know that I was almost going to do the same action as him.</p>
<p>When I was flying level, I saw him waving his hand to signal, tilting his plane forward to show respect, and then we parted ways and went back.</p>
<p>In the twenty-two minutes of air combat, my plane had three hundred and twenty-six bullet holes, and I was fortunate to only suffer one arm injury. After that, Bruno Mussolini was no longer the captain of the Palma Air Force.</p>

<h3>Repay Strikes with Strikes</h3>
<p>— Liu Zenghui</p>
<h3>A Place to Live</h3>
<p>— Hua Fu</p>
<p>People living in the world, according to common sense, always have a place to live. However, some people are wailing and saying that they don't even have a place to stand. What is the reason for this? Smart people say that these people end up in this situation because they are too stupid. Besides, heaven and earth are inherently broad, so how can such a thing happen?</p>
<p>The way smart people deal with the world is indeed wonderful. In short, their first step is to blow, using their mouths to blow. Their mouths are better than the dragon's mouth that exhales air into clouds. With a single blow, they can change the color of heaven and earth. If they apply it in a small way, stirring up the wind, a blow can at least make the crowded people around them fall before the wind, giving them a wide space for them to come and go alone. Is the use of blowing not great?</p>
<p>The second step is to pat, using their hands to pat. They know that blowing is for dealing with people on the same plane. For people above them, sometimes blowing is not effective. If they just blow, they cannot stop them from pressing down. This also requires the application of patting, patting upwards. Fortunately, the people above all eat this, as long as you are willing to pat, they will rise like a ball, like a balloon, lightly rising into the air, leaving enough space above your head for you to stick your head out.</p>
<p>Ordinary smart people, having reached the point where they are good at both blowing and patting, will be comfortable and at ease, and will no longer think about anything else, and will stop there. Only a kind of kind-hearted smart people want to go a step further to expand their living space. The second step of this further step is to step, using their feet to step.</p>
<p>The wonderful use of stepping seems to be far above blowing and patting. Those who study how to establish themselves in the world must know this. Stepping means treading others underfoot. If the four sides have already been clear due to blowing, and the top has already been loosened due to patting, and now there is nothing to step on under your feet, then you can stand tall and be the only one respected. Even further, if you are really busy and have no time to blow and pat, then as long as you know how to step, stepping hard, the more you step on under your feet, the more you can rise up, like a square inch of wood, higher than a high tower. At that time, those in the same position as you will naturally be far behind, and if those above you cooperate with you, you will lift him up along with you, otherwise, you will simply overturn him, and you can "take his place."</p>
<p>Why should these smart people who are good at stepping be called kind-hearted? There is no other reason, because they see that ordinary useless things are not used, which is a bit of a waste. So they have great compassion and use them one by one as stepping stones, turning decay into magic, so that they can do their best and get what they deserve. They have simply done a great good deed, so they are called kind-hearted.</p>
<p>There are many smart people nowadays, and there are especially many kind-hearted smart people, so everyone is a great old man, and the world is very peaceful. As for stupid people, of course there are still some, but there are very few. They have no place to live, which is their own fault. Who asked them not to understand the three-part song of blowing, patting, and stepping?</p>
<p>Stupid people are simply the remnants and waste of the world. Wouldn't the world be even more spacious without them, allowing smart people to walk freely and enjoy themselves? In all fairness, smart people should not give these stupid people a place to live, and of course, they should not leave them a place to stand. Some smart people are still willing to give them a position under their feet, so that they can live. Such smart people, are they not kind-hearted?</p>
<p>Smart people say that heaven and earth are broad, which is very good. Isn't it that they themselves have a place to live, and even stupid people have a place to stand because of them! Amitabha, smart people are both smart and kind, which is rare!</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>"Town Chief Chen died for all the people in our town, and also for the country and the nation. We should all respect him. In addition, I hope that you will all report the heroic deeds of the compatriots who died in this incident to the best of your knowledge. I believe that although the supreme leader is currently busy arranging military affairs, he will soon order the collection of these heroic deeds, and then I can report them and request commendation and compensation."</p>
<p>The funeral was held, and then the memorial week and lectures began. Regiment Commander Ye's expression became even more solemn. He said in a very calm voice:</p>
<p>"We must all always remember this bloody lesson. Why were the enemies able to capture Hepu Town so quickly? It is nothing more than because we still have major weaknesses and cannot achieve the effect of military-civilian cooperation. The creation of this weakness is due to the fact that in the past, our general public did not take the interests of the country and nation as a prerequisite, but only knew how to be selfish and seek temporary security. They did not know that personal interests and property are entrusted to the country and nation. If the country and nation are not protected, how can personal interests and property be protected? You see, Yang Yueliang, this miser, is a good example. He desperately hid his silver, but the enemy took it all away. Not only could he not enjoy it, but he also lost his life. Such a death is really disgraceful! Are you willing to die so disgracefully?" (The crowd shouted: "We are not willing to die like that.")</p>
<p>"Therefore, from now on, everyone must wash their minds and change their ways and start again, taking the interests of the country and nation as a prerequisite in everything. We must know that personal life is limited, and the life of the country and nation is infinite. If a person comes into this world and only cares about living a comfortable life for themselves, they are really the most useless people. Only those who can sacrifice themselves for the country and nation are great heroes and great men. Remember, Chairman Chiang has two good sayings: 'The purpose of life is to improve the life of all mankind, and the meaning of life is to create the life that continues the universe.' I hope you will all always remember these two sentences, strive to serve the war of resistance, create benefits for others, and do not only care about yourselves. Only in this way will you not have lived in vain." (Applause enthusiastically)</p>
<p>After the lecture, the flag-raising ceremony was held. The flagpole had already been erected in the square. In the melodious sound of military music, the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth began to slowly rise to the top of the flagpole. Regiment Commander Ye led the crowd in the highest salute to the national flag, and then they all shouted: "Long live the Republic of China!" "Long live Chairman Chiang!" "Long live the victory of the War of Resistance!"</p>
<p>In this high shout, the bright and beautiful flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth, facing the dawn wind, fluttered, as if expressing its unwillingness to only occupy the small space of Hepu Town, but to fly to every corner of China.</p>
<p>(The End)</p>

<p>The farmers have green sorrow.</p>

<h3>Why Refuse to Accept One-Yuan Legal Tender?</h3>
<p>— You Cong</p>
<p>Recently, because there are many "one-yuan legal tender" notes on the market, and the supply exceeds the demand, the financial market is somewhat tired of "one-yuan legal tender" notes. According to the Shen Bao on the 26th, some banks and money shops in this city have even refused to accept one-yuan legal tender notes. For large sums of money, merchants and citizens who have to pay the money are required to exchange the one-yuan banknotes for five-yuan or ten-yuan notes themselves. This is really an illegal act, and we cannot help but bring it up to chat about it.</p>
<p>First of all, we want to talk about the explanation of the two characters "legal tender". Few people mentioned the two characters "legal tender" four or five years ago. It was not until November 4, 1935, when our Ministry of Finance promulgated the "New Currency Law", that these characters often appeared. In general, self-proclaimed modern ladies always shout "legal tender" at every turn, simply treating it as a synonym for "banknotes", and it has become a fashionable catchphrase. This is somewhat of a misinterpretation. Now we want to discuss the problem that "one-yuan legal tender notes must not be refused," so we should fundamentally start from the two characters "legal tender."</p>
<p>Most people think that legal tender means banknotes, and some people think that legal tender is synonymous with national currency, but both are wrong. Originally, legal tender is a country's "standard currency," which has the qualification of "unlimited legal tender," unlike "subsidiary currency," which only has the qualification of "limited legal tender." The so-called "unlimited legal tender" means that no matter how large a debt under the national law, if the debtor uses "legal tender" to repay it, then the creditor must not refuse to accept it under any pretext. However, "subsidiary currency," which only has the qualification of "limited legal tender," is different. It can only have the qualification of legal tender within the amount limited by the national law. In other words, if the debtor uses all "subsidiary currency" to repay a large debt (exceeding the amount limited by the national law), then the creditor can refuse to accept it according to the law and ask to exchange it for legal tender before accepting it. Therefore, each country has its own legal tender, and each country has its own specific regulations on "limited legal tender." Before our country's Ministry of Finance promulgated the New Currency Law on November 4, 1935, silver coins were "legal tender" and milli-dollars were "subsidiary currency." As for the non-circulation of banknotes in various banks, it is a kind of exchange coupon and does not have the qualification of unlimited legal tender. Later, our country implemented the new currency policy, and the New Currency Law was officially promulgated, so it nationalized silver coins and designated the banknotes of the four banks of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank as our country's legal tender (Note: The designation of China Farmers Bank banknotes as legal tender was newly stipulated after the New Currency Law was promulgated). In other words, except for the banknotes of these four banks, none of them have the qualification of unlimited legal tender, and corner tickets and nickel coins are naturally subsidiary currencies. Regarding the specific regulations on limited legal tender, our country has long had a clear order: "Five-corner subsidiary currency is limited to 20 yuan, two-corner subsidiary currency is limited to 5 yuan, and one-fen and five-fen subsidiary currency are limited to one yuan." Therefore, if this limit is exceeded, then the receiver can refuse to accept it. As for the one-yuan, five-yuan, and ten-yuan banknotes of the four banks of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank, since the government has clearly designated them as "legal tender," then they are naturally good currency with "unlimited legal tender." From as little as one yuan to as much as ten thousand, all can be repaid with "legal tender," and no one may refuse to accept it.</p>
<p>It can be seen that from the perspective of national law, one-yuan legal tender notes must absolutely not be refused. Moreover, we can also explain it from the silver and money industry itself. Article 5 of Chapter 4 of the Shanghai Banking Industry Regulations also clearly stipulates that "all receipts and payments shall be made in national currency in accordance with the Ministry Order of the Ministry of Finance on November 4, 1935." Article 5 of Chapter 4 of the Shanghai Money Industry Regulations also stipulates that "all receipts and payments shall be made in national currency in accordance with the Ministry Order of the Ministry of Finance on April 6, 1933." (Note: The Money Industry Regulations should be revised in accordance with the Banking Industry Regulations for this article). In fact, national currency has a broader scope than legal tender, which means that it also includes subsidiary currency. Therefore, the refusal of some banks and money shops in this city to accept one-yuan legal tender notes is both a violation of national law and a failure to abide by the industry regulations of the same industry.</p>
<p>The New Currency Law concludes by saying: "...It is hoped that the people of the whole country will understand this purpose and abide by it consistently...If there is deliberate obstruction or spreading of rumors...the law will be strictly enforced without any leniency..." Article 8 of the Central Bank Exchange Coupon Regulations (promulgated by the National Government in November 1928) says: "Anyone who counterfeits Central Bank exchange coupons or destroys the credit of exchange coupons shall be punished according to the law of Germany."</p>
<p>"Why refuse to accept one-yuan legal tender notes?" I want to ask.</p>

It narrates the events of the Gengzi National Crisis and is the masterpiece of late Qing ballads. The entire book consists of forty chapters. It includes a preface, stating the creative motivation: "…Once the peace agreement was reached, the situation changed drastically. The habits of extravagance and debauchery returned to people's hearts. The practice of perfunctory work and evasion of responsibility still prevailed in the world. It was almost as if times had changed, the world was different, and feelings had shifted. Therefore, the author created the Ballad of the National Crisis." It is a work with feeling, not just a poetic history.</p>
<p>Strong Words of the Boxer Rebellion</p>
<p>Written by Tanxi Sheng. Published in the Xinhai year of Xuantong (1911) as a lithograph, consisting of two volumes of twenty books and two books. It includes illustrations. The full title is "Illustrated Secret Novel of the Boxer Rebellion." In fact, this is a reprint of the first half of the "Ballad of the Gengzi National Crisis," with the author's name often changed by the bookstore.</p>
<p>Ballad of the French Heroine</p>
<p>Written by Wan Ci Ren. Published by the Xiaoshuo Lin Society in the Jia Chen year of Guangxu (1904). It tells the story of Madame Roland. The entire book consists of ten chapters, in one volume. A poem at the beginning reads: "Ah, the beautiful woman is pitiful, her rouge and powder are worn out in the service of the country. Who buys seventy thousand strings of incense, everyone vying for the female hero." Another poem says: "European winds and ink rains are boundless, the female world is silent and lacks spirit. Don't say the Jianghao brush has lost its tip, spring comes and new flowers of freedom bloom." There are also two opening poems, one of which says: "The affairs of the vast Middle Kingdom are sad, do you know that the people's strength is exhausted? The ruler and the illustration are full of mixed colors, and the three classes of society are half drunk and happy. I sadly wipe away a tear, and a thousand people call me crazy. I only care for the children in the red window, reading ballads by lamplight every night."</p>
<p>A Stern Awakening</p>
<p>Written by Chen Tianhua. A propaganda pamphlet for the Qing Dynasty revolutionary party, later included in "Manchu-Han Miscellany" compiled by Si Hanzi. It is an anti-Manchu work, enumerating the sins of the Manchus occupying the Han people's land for over two hundred years, the crisis of China, and urging everyone to drive out the Manchus for self-salvation. Each singing section is followed by an explanation, with more prose than singing. The opening verse says: "The great land has fallen for hundreds of years, the flames of war rage and blood flows. It breaks my heart to recount the past, who among our compatriots will avenge this shame?" Then comes a section saying, and then the main text begins: "I take up the clapper and drum, sit in the long street, and sing loudly. Listen closely, fellow compatriots, listen carefully. Our China was originally a famous and great nation. Not like those small lands, remotely located in the periphery..."</p>
<p>Ballad of Civilization Lamp in the Women's World</p>

The topics are: "Establishing Education," "Natural Feet," "Recreation," "Superstition," "Child Brides," "Breaking Prison," "Tea Party," "Rejecting Contracts." It is a work for the women's world at that time. It opens with a "West River Moon" verse: "Pushing to the East and West worlds, dividing the North and South flags. A bare brush writes new words, forming a history of freeing slaves. Let's bring the beautiful fruits of civilization, and transfer them to the new branches of China. Unquenched spirit supports bitterly, only for the women of our compatriots."</p>

It is a ballad of enlightenment education from the late Qing Dynasty, an anti-superstition work. The unprinted opening poem says: "Evening drum and morning bell awaken the great world, leisurely and unaware of the years. Boundless Buddhist law points to equality, practicing Zen with the master to reach the supreme vehicle." It also says: "I also know that equal teachings are difficult to implement, a colorful brush composes a wonderful new ballad. Fortunately, I still have a three-inch tongue, waiting to see the nod when the stubborn stone nods."</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on "A Record of the Film City"</h3>
<p>— Sijing</p>
<p>At this time last year, we heard that Mr. Chen Kengran was going to make a film set in a photography studio, and the title was already set as "Floating Clouds on the Silver Sea," but later he changed it to "Woman." The current "Record of the Film City" is said to have taken the outline of "Floating Clouds on the Silver Sea," but the content is completely different. For example, the ending in the current "Record of the Film City" and the male lead's jealousy, causing the female lead to jump off the building and commit suicide; when the camera pulls back, it turns out to be filming a scene, this most dramatic ending is almost an overturn of "Floating Clouds on the Silver Sea."</p>
<p>From a "business perspective," there are indeed many British films with photography as the background, but they are still rare in domestic films, and the audience of American films and domestic films seems to have a very obvious distinction, so works like "Record of the Film City" naturally still have their "business sense." How the strong wind is made, how the heavy rain falls, and what is used to replace snowflakes, when watching "Record of the Film City," I heard many viewers feel novel and shocked. And inside there is a very moving love triangle story: the director and the male lead compete for the love of a female lead. Sure enough, there may be a hint of irony in this, such as when the ending camera pulls back, it is filming a scene, and the screenwriter says: "The play is basically a play!" But this ironic meaning is very weak. At most, it exposes the faces of certain people.</p>
<p>Speaking of exposure, there is a scene in "Record of the Film City" that is worth mentioning: after the female lead is injured while filming on location, because the work of the photography studio cannot be stopped, the director uses the "promoting new talent" as a major topic to persuade the production director. Naturally, the production director also has his own reasons: "For the sake of appeal, the company cannot employ a person without acting experience to serve as the protagonist. But the facts are in front of us, are holding on to a few 'old people' still able to have appeal? On the contrary, what is the appeal of many new people? And, if we are not forgetful, isn't the advertisement in the newspaper for the protagonist of a certain film a strong proof? Therefore, even for one's own sake, we should actively train and promote new people. This is actually not a 'big topic,' history is cruel!"</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Kengran's directing technique is relatively advanced, except that the charity entertainment show for disaster relief is too long, (in fact, the insertion of this charity entertainment show is also very abrupt, why not emphasize the original intention of this scene, but only use such a lengthy performance to "satisfy" the audience? This is the self-satirical chapter of "Record of the Film City.") He pulls the emotions of the entire play very tightly.</p>
<p>Many scenes that use clever tricks are also very natural. For example: when Lu Ming receives a letter from Li Ying's house and cries, Wen Yiming thinks that his drinking is the reason why his daughter is sad and throws away the wine glass, and when Wang Naidong brings a gun to look for Li Ying, Lu Ming rushes to make a phone call, and Li Ying answers the phone with a friend inviting him to dinner, etc. The final ending is naturally the most prominent of the clever tricks.</p>
<p>Lu Ming and Wang Naidong's performances are both adequate.</p>

<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Paired Swallows and Orioles Reflect the Jade Wall, Yue Silk and Wu Brocade are Woven into Seven Clouds</p>
<p>However, Ms. Wang does not understand, but for a moment, moved by emotion, she seems somewhat reluctant to part. The five-year-old girl, upon hearing that her parents are going to take her out of the hospital and leave Ms. Wang, also cries incessantly. Because her own biological mother also often comes to see her, but after all, she only comes once or twice a month, which is not as often as Ms. Wang's visits. On the day of discharge, the girl hugged Ms. Wang's leg, with tears and snot, crying without end. Ms. Wang comforted her, stroking her hair with one hand, her tears falling like broken strings of beads. Many people who saw it helped them shed tears as well. Later, the girl's father said, "Since they are so reluctant to part, let's ask the hospital to keep her for another year." It is said that it is not only Ms. Wang, but many other nannies and the children they raise are reluctant to separate. In short, when a child separates from their nanny, both sides will always cry. Now, the two Misses He saw that several infant rooms were run by nannies. Some could already walk, some were still learning to walk, some could already speak, some were just learning to speak, some were sleeping, and some were smiling at people. In these infant rooms, you only heard the children's laughter, not their crying. There were also two infant rooms that were for children under one year old, who were taken care of with special care. It is said that the mortality rate of young children is highest in all age groups, so Dr. Lao Zhang paid special attention. As for those even younger, those born within three months, those babies were protected in the infant room of the Women and Children's Hospital and were not sent to the Infant Care Institute for the time being. The two Misses He finally came to the room of the triplets. It turned out that this was a special room, and this nanny was in charge of the three little babies. The nanny's surname was Kang, and her given name was Ning, and she was originally a nurse at the Women and Children's Hospital. Dr. Lao Zhang specially hired her because she was careful, hardworking, and her temperament was very gentle. Ms. Kang Ning was also very happy, this was a great honor, when people asked who was raising these three little babies? They would point her out. But the responsibility was also heavier than that of other nannies. If one of the three children suddenly felt a little uncomfortable today, it would make Ms. Kang Ning anxious, and she would not have a moment of peace in her heart. Fortunately, these three children were more obedient to her than to their own mother, and they listened to her in everything, which made Ms. Kang Ning entrust all her spirit to them. (74)</p>

<h3>The Entertainment World's Movement to Relieve Child Refugees</h3>
<p>— Jinding</p>
<p>Written before the Fourth of April Children's Day</p>
<p>Due to the prolongation of the Sino-Japanese war and the expansion of the war zone, the number of refugees coming to Shanghai to seek refuge has also increased day by day; at the same time, the number of child refugees has undoubtedly increased to a huge number! Therefore, how to relieve these many child refugees wandering on isolated islands has become a noteworthy issue.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Eighth Celebration Children's Day Preparatory Committee is conducting intensive preparations for the upcoming Fourth of April Children's Day; in addition to sending letters to major companies and stores, requesting donations of Children's Day gifts, so that they can be distributed to various child welfare institutions and refugee reception centers on Children's Day, the committee also sent letters to the entertainment world, asking them to increase the Children's Day celebration programs on Children's Day, and to provide free admission to refugee reception centers and allow child refugees to watch movies in cinemas, so that these poor child refugees can receive spiritual comfort. From the perspective of relieving child refugees, we feel that this move has considerable significance and value.</p>
<p>However, in my humble opinion, the entertainment world's movement to relieve child refugees should be expanded and made more practical. If we only increase the celebration programs on Children's Day, and treat child refugees favorably by providing free movie tickets, then the effectiveness of the work will not be great. We hope that the entire entertainment world, in addition to the above two tasks on Children's Day, will also donate two or three tenths of the regular income to the child refugee reception centers or child welfare institutions as funds for relieving child refugees. If this can be done, then the child refugees can truly receive practical benefits.</p>
<p>In addition, such as the addition of stimulating slogans for relieving child refugees in movie theaters, the insertion of dialogues about relieving child refugees in theatrical plays, the addition of opening chapters about relieving child refugees on broadcasting stations, and the propagation of the suffering of child refugees by storytellers... all of these can directly or indirectly stimulate the sympathy of the general public, and will invisibly increase the great power for the relief of child refugees.</p>
<p>Work hard! The entertainment world's movement to relieve child refugees.</p>
<h3>Chatting about Opera at Chunjiu Lu</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>In the past, the Sanqing and Sixi two major Huiban opera troupes in Beiping often had different lyrics for the same opera. Later, Tan Xinpei took the lead in the opera world. Thus, the influence of the Sanqing troupe's scripts began to spread north and south. However, the merits of the Sixi scripts are also indelible. The old Sixi troupe had Zhang Kuiguan and Wang Jiuling in the front, and Sun Juxian and Liu Jingran in the back. Their scripts were mostly different from today's preparatory school. Zhang Kuiguan was good at whole plays, such as "The Satisfactory Marriage" and "Ying Daqiu," which are famous scripts among them. After Zhang Kuiguan's death, the head lecturer of whole plays was Liu Jingran. After Jingran's death, I don't know where they flowed. It's a pity.</p>
<p>Between the Tongzhi and Guangxu years of the late Qing Dynasty, there were two whole plays, "Lotus Pond" and "Celebrating Anlan," compiled by He Jingyu. Jingyu was imprisoned in the Ministry of Justice due to an incident. Bored in prison, he used this to pass the time. The lyrics of the plays were mostly allegorical, and they were deeply moving. At that time, they were called masterpieces. I lived in Beiping and searched everywhere for them, but I never got to read them.</p>
<p>Xinpei's plays mostly followed Sanqing, but there were many reforms. In the Xinyou year of the Republic of China, Wang Youchen performed at the Yi Stage and had a very close relationship with me. His wife was Xinpei's daughter. She once told me that Xinpei only personally taught Youchen one play, "The Broken Secret Stream." All the others were obtained by Youchen's own pondering. Therefore, he cannot be completely the same as Xinpei. She also said that Shuyan's play was only "Taiping Bridge," which was personally taught by Mr. Tan. All the others were learned from Wang Changlin. Therefore, he is also different from Xinpei. At that time, Youchen was learning "Zhu Lian Village" from Zhang Rongkui. His wife did not approve of it very much. She said to me, "In the past, there was a 'Three Great Sages' excerpt. The original lyrics had fifty-six sentences. My father always sang this excerpt when he warmed up his voice. Because he was deeply immersed in it, he could remember it." (The original lyrics will be published tomorrow)</p>
<p>During the Tongzhi and Guangxu years, it was the time of the ZTE Restoration. The atmosphere was simple and unadorned. The actors were healthy and full of energy. When they sang plays, they would often sing hundreds of sentences. They did not advocate fancy tunes, but the rhythm was like coming from the heavens. The listeners were never tired of hearing them, but only worried that there would be too little. In recent times, the atmosphere has become thin and people's hearts are impetuous. They only love to listen to fancy tunes, like the flattering of villains. And nine out of ten actors are trapped by opium and women. Their inner Qi is not sufficient. They can only use fancy tunes to please people. And the listeners are also mostly mediocre people with low appreciation ability. These people are full of fat and indulgence, and they don't know what music is. Therefore, it goes worse and worse. The ancient sounds can no longer be heard.</p>
<h3>Records of Silver Screen Storms</h3>
<p>— Sha</p>
<p>Xu Xinfu has been busy recently preparing to shoot "Chen Chali Returns to China for the Second Detective Case." There are many gimmicks in the play, and it will definitely be more exciting than the first episode.</p>
<p>Wu Cun's "Tears of Song" was screened at the Jincheng Theater last night. The success of the singing scenes has set a record for domestic productions. Gong Qiuxia's acting skills are also exceptionally excellent, and it may be released in early April.</p>
<p>Huang Tianzuo, the former deputy director of the Central Photography Studio, has come to Shanghai to do business after retiring.</p>
<p>Liu Qiong is currently the best actor, and recently starred in Li Pingqian's "Golden and Silver World."</p>
<p>Yuan Shaomei decided to join the Datong Film Studio on June 1st, starring in "The Sensual History of a Dancer" directed by Gong Jianong. Her personal experience is sure to have gimmicks.</p>
<p>The protagonist of Guohua's new film "The Sensual History of Su San," Liu Zhonghao, has agreed with Wu Cun to hire Gong Qiuxia to play the role. It is said that Zhang Shichuan also agrees very much, because Zhang has always been very fond of Gong.</p>
<p>Fang Peilin has been working hard on the three episodes of "The Incarnation Girl." It is expected that the business of this episode will not be inferior to "Wu Zetian," but the scenery will be slightly inferior.</p>
<p>Zheng Xiaoqiu is stepping up the work on "The Pearl of Night." This gentleman's directing technique has the demeanor of the old master Zheng Qiu.</p>
<p>Wang Yin's directorial debut "Desperate Fugitive" has a very good title. The content is unknown. If it has the spirit of "The Escape" back then, it will be worth watching.</p>

<h3>Secret History of the Forbidden City's Liyuan in the Old Capital (134)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>So Kongming thought about it and thought that the time to destroy Cao was still early, so it was better to let him return to Beijing temporarily. On one hand, he first occupied Jingzhou and took Changsha and Wuling, step by step cultivating strength and expanding territory, until he took Chengdu and the great plan to enter Sichuan was completely completed, so that he could have a situation where he could attack when advancing and defend when retreating, and then plan to attack Cao. We can see that after Cao usurped the Han, he was so diligent in conquest, (Six Excursions to Qishan, Nine Expeditions to the Central Plains,) and he was so active in advancing, that we can know that he, Lao Guang, had no worries at all. Because when he released Cao in the first place, he hoped that the Cao family would usurp the throne. The infamy of usurping the throne has already been taken by the Cao family, and at the same time, the Han family's world has already perished. At this time, Kongming protected the young master and snatched the country back from the Cao family, first destroying Wei and then destroying Wu, striving to have the world in his arms, and righteously supporting the young master to ascend the throne. At this time, who can say that he usurped it? People often say "borrow a knife to kill people," but Kongming's trick can be regarded as "borrowing people to test the knife." To sum it up in one sentence, "Releasing Cao at Huarong Road was to keep him for usurping the Han in the future, and to let the Cao family and his son take the blame." Although it is only a difference of a turn of the hand, the origin of the young master's title is very different from that of the Cao family. Unfortunately, heaven's will belonged to Jin, and the Sima family, being close to the water, took this step first, which made Mr. Zhuge hate Jiuquan, and this can be regarded as his futile effort."</p>
<p>Thirteen Sisters Examine Kin and Nian Gengyao Respects Teachers</p>
<p>Now, the role of Dan in "Thirteen Sisters" mostly follows the Yaoqing school. Among the four famous Dans, Xun Huisheng's performance of this play is the best, because he is good at Dao Ma, and the Beijing Bai recitation is fluent and pleasant to listen to. Therefore, after Yu Zhuang Yaoqing, he should be regarded as the first choice. Among the Kun Dans, I have seen Xue Yanqin perform the complete "Thirteen Sisters." Her voice was originally sweet and mellow, and there was a kind of water sound mixed in it, so in addition to the good recitation, the long singing after the memorial service was also very exciting. The main intention of this "Romance of Heroes and Heroines" is also in the word "filial piety." An Longmei had to save his father from difficulty, so he was far away from his hometown, regardless of the dangers along the way, and took two thousand taels of silver to rescue his family. As a weak doctor who had never been out of the house, he dared to make this attempt, which also shows that he was driven by the word "filial piety" and did not take all the dangers to heart.</p>
<h3>Snippets in the Broadcasting Circle (2)</h3>
<p>— Bihua</p>
<p>Later, Chen Dabe suddenly became happy and came to try broadcasting work. Of course, Chen Dabe is a pioneer in drama, and he has a good mind, so how could Gu Leiyin be able to match him? After Chen Dabe ran to the radio station to broadcast the Guanyin opera (which was his unique name on the radio station), as expected, the broadcast was very popular with the audience. At that time, Gu Leiyin was almost defeated by him. People who used to like to listen to Gu Leiyin's drama all loved to listen to Chen Dabe's Guanyin opera. After a short period of time, who knew that Chen Dabe's Guanyin opera would unexpectedly fail, and finally could not maintain it and dispersed. There are two reasons for this: one is that Chen Dabe's script for the Guanyin opera was too profound and difficult to popularize. People who are qualified really love to listen to it, but after all, the audience of radio is mostly ladies, so they still listen to "Pearl Tower" and "A Match Made in Heaven by Three Smiles"! The second is that his broadcasting price was too expensive and he was unwilling to compromise. Therefore, it was difficult to develop. It seemed like a flash in the pan and disappeared.</p>
<p>After Chen Dabe's Guanyin opera left, Li Changjian's Wen Sheng opera came. The nature was similar to Chen Dabe's. It really made me sweat for him that Li Changjian, who was not a drama practitioner, dared to come out boldly to broadcast Wen Sheng opera. Although he had been on stage, after all, he was a guest performer, and it could be said that he was a drama amateur. He actually went into the sea, and not on the stage, but on the radio. His courage is really not small. What is especially commendable is that he can play several roles by himself, and can speak dialects from various places, very fluently and pleasantly. It is said that if he does not make a sound, he is already a hit. Now he has occupied a considerable position in the broadcasting world, and the three words Wen Sheng opera have long been deeply imprinted in the minds of the audience. His scripts are mostly written by himself, and they are elegant and popular, and they can cater to the psychology of women, which is his strength. He can write a good hand, and print the scripts he has compiled into books and sell them to the audience, while giving away couplets written in his own handwriting. In this way, he has made a lot of connections, and I really admire his cleverness. He is also a member of our Story Broadcasting Research Association. He is very hardworking and not afraid of difficulties, which is his strength.</p>
<h3>The "Lute Song" Double Case Solved</h3>
<p>— Yinsi</p>
<p>Guohua's "Zhao Wuniang" voluntarily cancelled</p>
<p>Permission is granted to Xinhua to film exclusively</p>
<p>"The Lute Song" is a famous Kun opera, which tells the story of the separation and reunion of Cai Bojie and his wife. It is a folk tale that promotes the old etiquette. The plot is sad and tortuous. The Pi Huang opera that performs this play is called "Zhao Wuniang," and it is basically the same, without any difference. Not long ago, Xinhua Company decided to use it as a play material and adapted it into a costume film; then Chen Dabe started writing the script, and Chen Yanyan was selected to play the protagonist Zhao Wuniang, preparing to start filming in a short period of time. At that time, Guohua Company also had such a filming plan, and they posted an advertisement in the newspaper, 'Recruiting actors for the filming of "Zhao Wuniang"', which inevitably caused Xinhua to be surprised, forming a conflict. Because "The Lute Song" and "Zhao Wuniang" unexpectedly followed the same route, it would be obviously detrimental to business in the future. Xinhua initially planned to start filming this film in advance, and immediately changed it to a Huaxin Company production, and transferred it to Xinguang Theater for screening. By doing this, they would take the lead and avoid a direct conflict with Guohua's "Zhao Wuniang," which was also affiliated with Jincheng Theater. Later, Guohua ultimately gave priority to the friendship of the same industry, and learned that Xinhua's "Lute Song" was announced earlier, so it expressed its willingness to concede to Xinhua, and completely abandoned the original plan for "Zhao Wuniang," granting Xinhua permission to film it. This is how they were happy with each other and reached a resolution. And the Zhao Wuniang on the screen will also be "only one of a kind, and there is no division," and there will be no such amusing double-case scene.</p>
<h3>Entertainment News</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Dramatic Arts Society has decided to re-stage the famous play "This is Just Spring" at the Xinguang Theater on Sunday (April 2nd) morning. The cast of actors in this play is very strong. The hall chief is Li Jianwu, the detective is Chen Xihe, the wife is Xia Xia, the secretary is Xu Li, the female principal is Bai Li, the revolutionary party is Wang Mingsun, and the servant is Fang Xiang, all of whom are popular figures in today's drama world. It is said that in order to facilitate the audience, the society has changed the show time to 10:00 AM, and the ticket prices are still 6 jiao, 4 jiao, and there are also 6 jiao discount coupons for pre-sale, 4 sheets per book, priced at only 2 yuan.</p>
<p>The Shanghai John Dramatic Arts Society is organized by the students of St. John's University. The society is organizing a charity performance because there are many out-of-school children in Shanghai who urgently need education. The location has been decided to be the Lyceum Theater, and the time is April 8th and 9th. The script has been selected as Xu Xu's masterpiece "The Moon," which is a famous play that satirizes society. The actors and directors are all emerging talents and rising stars. The scenery has been preparing for more than a month, and the project is huge. After the performance, it will definitely cause a sensation in the city. Ticket prices are divided into 1 yuan, 2 yuan, 3 yuan, and 5 yuan. The society recently invited news reporters to visit the rehearsal. It is said that the results of the rehearsal are better than "Flowers Splashed with Tears," but the performance period is short and the number of tickets is limited. All drama lovers should buy tickets as soon as possible, so as not to miss this good opportunity.</p>
