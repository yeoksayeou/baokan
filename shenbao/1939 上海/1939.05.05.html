<h3>李維諾夫氏去職與英國</h3>
<p>國際大局動盪·萬方錯雜不人羣惄焉不知所與歸；惟以英蘇二國之强，卓然為左右大局前途之重耍因素；而二國進行中之談判，允為因素中之酵母；代表蘇聯，負責折衝者，人民外交委員長李維諾夫氏。談判之成敗利鈍，二强悲歡離合，全能國側目而視，民治國傾耳而聴，顧乃消息傳來，李氏忽爾去職。蘇聯最高會議不稍遲疑，即予核准；遺缺不屬諸副委員長波丹金氏，而由人民委員會主席莫洛托夫氏兼攝。事出兀突，舉世驚愕；而蘇聯方面，不特事前絕不示人以朕兆，抑且當機立斷，指揮若定；蘇聯政治洵別具風格，為世界政史中之創作；謂為神秘，顧非革命性之流露，新國家之氣象哉！</p>
<p>李維諾夫氏年逾六十，為布爾希維克忠實信徒，帝俄時代獻身革命，革命成功後以中央執行委員而任外交工作；一九二五年，人民外交委員長齊采林氏退休，遂繼其任，以迄今茲，蓋閱十四寒暑矣。蘇聯在國際，由孤苦伶仃，成為玷壇重鎭，由衆矢之的，成為衆望所歸，固非一人一事所致，然就外交言之，李維諾夫氏身與其役，實居首功。夫豈職位使然，機緣使然，其卓螢之才調實不可及也。綜其事績：除為國盡瘁，消弭各國之嫉視，取得各國之承認而外，供獻國際極多；加入國聯，轉變其氣氛，一也；制定非戰公的，二也；主張集體安全制，三也；為侵略國作嚴明之定義，四也；主張撒廢軍備，五也；與多國締結互不侵犯協定，六也；與法國締盟，安定歐局，七也；當世各國外交家立言立功，舉無足與李維諾夫氏倫比者。今忽去職，在蘇聯必有其內在之因果，顧不能不為國際深惜也。</p>
<p>李維諾夫氏去職原因，未經蘇聯當局公表，稱病非確辭。當一九三七年十一月問，歐洲之不慊於蘇聯，因是而厭惡李氏者，嘗盛傳李氏因黨案嫌疑，將棄職遠行；嗣有事實反　其說之誣妄，今之去職亦必與此無干。然則何去職之兀突乎？或指此為蘇聯外交政策轉變之先聲。夫外交政策為國家主要國策之一部份，凡國政之具有常軌者，決不輕易變更外交政策；謂蘇聯將劇變於國際動盪之今茲，此不可信。蘇聯國策。以其立國之特性而較任何國家為堅定，外交政策繫於國家中樞而不繫於外交官；故其外交成就，可以歸功於李維諾夫氏之才調，而其外交方針，不視李維諾夫氏而轉移；謂李氏去職乃因政策轉變，此又不可信。且蘇聯今日之外交，以主旨言，求安全，求和平；以政策言，以反抗侵略為彼骨榦，以全能國家為彼勁敵；前年之與法締盟，即本此旨，今得英國捐棄保守之成見，降格相就，允為國際之奇蹟，亦蘇聯之成功；幾乎有執歐陸牛耳之觀矣，謂寗棄前功，更張政策，髯絕英法，交驩德義耶；此更不可信，抑絕不可信者也。</p>
<p>或指此為蘇聯內政之風波，人事之傾軋。此類官僚政治之理論與觀念，不適用於蘇聯，故不可信。蘇聯內部之所謂肅淸工作，屢經宣明其已成功，已停止，豈有餘波？故亦不可信。退百步言，容有事，豈無更妥善之時機，乃必犧牲第一流外交人才，於此外交折衝異常艱鉅之今日？是亦絕不可信者也。</p>
<p>以我人度之，李維諾夫氏之去職，與蘇聯根本政策無關而事因還在外交。蘇聯外交大體有三方面：對遠東，對中東歐，對法對英。對遠東，在今日重要而不尖銳；且其重要之核心，不在所謂外交；故李氏為外交而去職，却不為遠東，對中歐東歐，則於德義亦不以外交為核心，此外則人民外交副委員長波丹金氏方歷聘於國際，任務未畢，報命有待，茲無功罪可言；故李氏為外交而去職，却亦不為中東歐。對法，有盟的為依歸，法蘇可謂融洽無間。問題焦點不在英蘇間乎！溯自英蘇開始談判以來，舉世方謂蘇聯之集體安全政策，將與英國之組識反侵略集團，一拍即合；詎知事閱兼旬，若即若離，未見進展。蘇聯對此絕未作何解釋，作何宣傳；而英國首相外相之所以答復國會議員之質問者，吞吐其辭，各有難言之隱。個中癥結，自非局外人所得明瞭；恰如李維諾夫氏去職，乃為各方所不解。兩負為正，謂不可互相發明乎！綜觀各方傳述，蘇聯對於英國式之外交，甚多不快之感，顧猶末節。但英國反侵略集團之組織，漠視遠東；耍求蘇聯在西陲負荷重大責任，而於蘇聯在遠東所蒙可能之危險，則英國吝予互助之諾言；此殆為使蘇聯感覺大不快者一。英國旣慷慨先予波蘭羅馬尼亞諸國以保障，而於事後要求蘇聯步武後塵，此其客觀之結果，似將保障責任轉嫁其一部或全部於蘇聯；不特如此而已，波蘭等旣得英國保障之後，一面更有所期待於蘇聯，一面仍有所戒懼於蘇聯；英國非但未能善導其所保障之國家，使之對蘇聯推誠相與，且是認其間隔閡之存在而左袒之；此殆為使蘇聯感覺大不快者二。此類英國式之聰明，必為李維諾夫氏所能委曲周旋，而未必為蘇聯之最高機構所能容忍。蓋李氏為外交家，自有其外交家之胸襟與作風；而蘇聯之最高機構，則革命性之新國家之代表也。故兩國外交政策雖殊途同歸，而蘇聯最高機構殆以為李維諾夫氏之方式不足以促聰明之英國及早同登彼岸。鞭策之，修正之，其惟大刀闊斧，於是而李維諾氏去職矣！</p>
<p>凡此觀察，是吾恰合實際，願得方來之事實為之佐證。至於李氏去職原因，除蘇聯中樞而外，舉世莫能明暸，獨英國自首相張伯倫氏以决，必能默識之；李氏去職，舉世莫不驚愕、而張伯倫氏等必驚愕最甚；此或英國所不願承認，而記者所欲斷言者也。</p>

<h3>蘇聯外交委員長　李維諾夫突辭職　遺缺暫由莫洛托夫兼攝　外交政策不致根本變更　英蘇談判將蒙不利影響</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯最高議會主席團下令、蘇聯人民外交委員長李維諾夫呈請辭職、應與照准、任命人民委員會主席莫洛托夫兼人民外交委員長、（三日塔斯社電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇俄外交人民委員長李維諾夫辭職之原因、截至此時、官方尙無解釋之文告、惟關於李氏辭職後之影響一節、此間外交界人士指陳、李氏爲主張與西歐各國密切合作之政治家、使蘇聯加入國聯及與法國締結同盟之負責者、因此逆料李氏去職後、英法蘇」三國間之談判、或將蒙不利影響云、（四日海通電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯外委李維諾夫辭職後、則英蘇談話之舉將由新仟外委人民委員會委員長莫洛托夫進行、按李維諾夫執掌外交十年於茲、此時遄爾倦勤、使莫斯科外交界無所適從、昨日晚間十一時卅分、據無綫電報告、李氏業已自動辭去外委之職、遺缺暫由莫洛托夫繼任、惟不久外交部所發表之公報、文中除去「暫時三字、外交部並未說明一般情形、但指出李氏因年已六十一二歲、體况不佳云、（四日美聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）蘇聯外委李維諾夫辭職後、此間外交界今日均表示驚異、彼等之第一反響厥爲李氏之辭職、或將表示蘇聯孤獨派之勝利、良以孤立派對李維諾夫所持與西歐合作之政策、表示反對也、此間新聞記者於中國協會席上、將上項消息告知蘇聯駐英大使邁斯基、惟　氏對此一事表示緘默、其他蘇聯人士對李氏此舉、亦拒絕發表意見、但彼等於數日前、業已預料設英法兩國不接受蘇聯堅强互助條的之建議、則蘇聯與英法間之談話或將決裂、衆信蘇聯孤立派包含軍事領袖在內、認爲拉攏英法兩國制止歐洲之侵略、實屬徒勞無益、蘇聯應退至彼等防棧之後、如是則始能將任何直接攻擊蘇聯之舉、予以擊退云、（四日美聯電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）外交人民委員長李維諾夫辭職之後、此問消息靈通人士頃宣稱、此舉乃因英蘇兩國進行談判遲延不決所致、人民委員會主席莫洛托夫兼綰外交、僅屬暫時性質、但負責人士則謂、李維諾夫去職山於身體孱弱、外傳此乃蘇聯變更外交政策之朕兆、並非確詞、「緣蘇聯政府內部無所謂個人政策、各當局所推行之同樣的政策、實即蘇聯政府與共產黨所公有之政策、但各觀察家宣稱、李維諾夫行年六十三歲、體質素强、似不致因健康關係邋爾倦勤、此公平昔對於集體安全政策主張甚烈、共產黨大會上决開會時、史丹林竟乃明白指摘西歐各國、謂欲在德蘇兩國之間掀起戰事藉以解決其本身遭遇之困難、此其命意、顯已不滿於集體安全原則、迄至最近、外交人民委員會機關報「莫斯科週報」（乃用法文出版）忽由政府決定停刋、殆以打擊加諸李維諾夫、抑英蘇兩國談判進行情形如伺、蘇聯各報並無一字及之、於以見李維諾夫之去職、實與此項談判發展情形有關、而英法兩國拒不接受蘇聯建議卽由英法蘇三國訂立軍事同盟條的一項建議、允爲李維諾夫去職之主要原因、要而言之、慕尼黑協定成立以還、蘇聯政府雖允李維諾夫就集體安全政策作最後一决試騐、茲已失敗、自不得不呈請辭職云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯官方　守口如瓶</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）本日蘇聯之報章、對於李維諾夫之辭職未加計確、祇於第一頁刊載、蘇聯政府派莫洛托夫爲外交委員長之命令、另頁刊戰小字謂、李維諾夫自動辭職云云、官方人士對此事亦守口如瓶、不贊一辭、是以神終過敏者認爲李氏或將與前此免職之大員、遭遇同樣之厄運、輕則監禁重則處死、亦未可知、但據外交界方面之觀察、李氏不致慘遭厄運、前此淸黨之風波、李氏竟得安然渡過、當非僥倖可致、再者本年五月一日李氏猶參加慶祝紀念、彼與史丹林意見之齟齬、當爲最近之事、李氏認爲反對法西斯主義、乃係蘇聯外交政策之主要目的、而史丹林則於數星期前會在演說中、公開宣示西歐資本主義諸國與法西斯主義國乃係一邱之貉，無從軒輊之、史氏復指摘英國有驅德國與蘇聯作戰之心、顯與李氏聯絡英法之政策不同、難免不焦慮李氏之應付失策、惟恐其不能懸崖勒馬、乃以莫洛托夫代之云、又訊、蘇聯各大使國之人員、預料將因李氏之去職、而發生若十變動、惟發動至何程度、殊不易臆測耳、（四日海通電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯外長更迭　英法大為驚愕</h3>
<p>（倫敦）關於蘇聯外交人民委員長李維諾夫辭職之消息、此間昨晚接到後、認爲完全出人意料、外交部引爲極大驚愕、據消息靈通人士申稱、李氏之辭職、與英國對於蘇聯最近提議之答覆並無關係、因該項覆文尙未送到莫斯科也、此閒外交界人士指陳、莫托洛夫雖任人民委員會主席有年、但在政治上並不重要、此决繼長外交、逆料蘇俄外交政策必有轉變、但目下尙難預言其方向云、（四日海通電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）關於蘇聯外交人民委員長李維諾夫辭職、以及由莫托洛夫繼任之消息傳到此間後、法國政界及外交界人士成表極大驚訝、而一般人民亦極注意、據接近外交部人士宣稱李維諾夫之去職、不外兩種原因之一、如非蘇聯不贊成李氏之西歐政策、即政府對於與西歐各國談判之滯緩引爲不滿、此輩人士對於法蘇公的將來之是吾有效、表示懷疑、同時對未來西歐各國與蘇俄之談判則抱悲觀云、（四日海通電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日標準晚報之社評內、對於蘇聯外交人民委員長李維諾夫去職之各種複雜關係及目前日本幕後所發生之種種清事加以檢討後、謂日本之所以遵守較合理之態度、其目的必在蘇聯之興情云、該報又稱、蘇聯東陲所感受之威脅的壓力、適於西方波德兩國發生更深裂痕之時趨於和緩、英法對波蘭提供之保證、已形成德蘇間之緩衝工具云、該報雖承認在達到此項論斷之途徑中、有無限之困難、惟稱「吾人或將終於見到猛獅與綿羊同時臥下」云、該報末稱日本之拒絕化防共公的爲同盟一事、使歐洲各獨裁國家、難在最近之將來計畫戰爭之最後試騐云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國與蘇聯之談判、進行頗爲濡緩、英國各報因此多有煩悶之感、茲聞蘇聯人民外交委員長李維諾夫遽爾辭職、焦念愈甚、一般評論雖隱的其詞、但悲觀心理躍然於字裏行問、泰晤士報外交問題記者宣稱、「李維諾夫辭職事、原非英國官塲意料所及、此際若遽下斷語、謂蘇聯外交政策即將變更、實嫌過早、緣以此間自莫斯科所接消息而論、蘇聯官方嘗謂該國對於西歐各國政策、一仍舊貫云」、工黨機關報每日民聲報載稱、「李維諾夫辭職事、匪特出於一般人意料之外、抑且至可驚愕、截至昨晚爲止、此間蘇聯人士與英國外交部均未夢想及此、况國際間重要談判正在進行之中、英國對於蘇聯所提建議、亦定於日內致送答案、而李維諾夫辭職事適於此際發生、未免可異、所遺人民外交委員長一缺、不由副委員長波丹金升任、亦可注意、此决更迭原因、姑置不論、然李維諾夫旣爲蘇聯効勞盡瘁、功績卓著、今之恝然下野、亦可以無愧矣」云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>李氏云職原因　各方揣測紛紜</h3>
<p>（巴黎）蘇聯人民外交委員長李維諾夫辭職一事、此間各報雖認爲意料所不及、但論調因視派別而異、幷不一致、至此事眞實原因何在、影響如何、亦紛粉加以揣測、所見互殊、急進社會黨事業報載稱、「據昨晚消息、德元首希特勒對於蘇聯外交當局之更迭、並無欣慰之理由、緣史丹林認爲蘇聯已至接受極嚴重的的束時期、爰欲自行主持外交談判、新任人民外交委員長莫洛托夫析衝樽俎、非所素畏、自必事事仰承史丹林意旨、果爾、則李維諾夫之去職、或即國聯會現行政策之反對表示、允可深信者、吾人頃自可靠方面探悉、史丹林對於西歐各國絕無變更現行政策之　、反之、且欲加强推行、」社會黨人民報載稱、或謂李維諾夫之獲譴、與英蘇兩國談判進行之濡緩、不無關係、此說似屬言之成理、於此又可分別觀之、一即李維諾夫之去職、乃因英蘇談判未能迅速完成、故莫洛托夫繼任之後、將以加緊談判爲急務、一即李維諾夫不顧困難、對於英國賡續談判鍥而不捨、致與蘇聯當局發生齟齬、因此不安於位、故今後蘇聯政策將改弦易轍、二說孰是、此際尙難斷定一云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（紐約）蘇聯人民委員會主席莫洛托夫之兼長外交頃由紐的泰晤士報加以評論、略謂華盛頓外交界人士成以此爲歐洲時局極嚴重的發展、値茲危機四伏國際重要談判正在進行之際李維諾夫竟爾去職、揆共原因、或以蘇聯人民外交委員長一職、久已有人逐鹿、李維諾夫卒乃不安於位、或因英蘇兩國現行談判迄無成就、二者之中、必居其一云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯出於此舉殆在警吿英法</h3>

<h3>革命政府成立紀念　全市懸旗慶祝</h3>
<p>兩租界納稅會發通告　各團體發表告同胞書</p>
<p>今日爲國民黨總理就任非常大總統革命政府成立之第十八週年紀念日、全市民衆、遵照中央規定、曁本市各界共同商決、應自動懸旗一日、以資慶祝、各團體並發表告民衆書、勸勗同胞、堅定信念、至關於過去之懸旗交涉、中央各部處、均來電慰勉、茲分誌如下、</p>
<p>懸旗通告</p>
<p>（一）公共租界納稅華人會公告云、茲經各團體暫定公共租界市民懸掛國旗、一年中共爲八日、計一月一日·三月十二日·三月二十九日·五月五日·七月一日·八月二十七日·十月十日·十一月十二日、特此公告、（二）法租界納稅華人會通告云、爲通告事、查五月五日、爲孫總理就任非常大總統紀念日、凡我界內市民、應於是日一律懸掛國旗、熱烈慶祝、是爲至要、持此通告</p>
<p>告同胞書</p>
<p>各團體發表之告同胞書、摘要如下、（一）民國十年、軍閥政客毀法亂紀、企圖破壞本黨所領導之革命勢力、總理爲要重整革命陣容、鞏固國家基礎、乃於民國十年五月五日、在粵就任非常國會所推選之非常大總統職、成立革命政府、創立國民政府之丕基、此種大無畏之奮鬥精神、我全市同胞、應深切瞭解、切實效法、（二）總理盡畢生之精力、以與一切反革命勢力搏鬥、其目的在求中國之獨立自由與平等、今全面抗戰、急遽展開、全國將士、以血肉築長城、全國同胞、以人力·物力·財力、貢獻政府、其目的亦在爭取國家之獨立自由與平等、故我人今日紀念革命政府之成立、更應加强奮鬥精神、堅定意志、完成總理未竟之志、（三）第一期抗戰、精神與物質並重第二期抗戰、精神重於物質、總理遺教中所昭示之心理建設、實爲最高理論依據而蔣委員長所頒佈之綱領及其實施辦法、則爲實行總理心理建設遺教之異體方案、故我人紀念革命政府之成立、允宜躬行實踐以有組織之精神、運用人力、物力及財力、奠定必勝必或之基石、</p>
<p>中央慰勉</p>
<p>（一）中央宣傳部來電、滬市民衆、熱烈推行、具見愛國赤忱良深嘉慰、巴渝東望、彌切眷懷、尙希轉達中央眷念之至意、（二）中央社會部來電、懸旗一案義達雲霄、滬市同胞之奮鬥精神、中外共欽、現聞被捕同胞、全部無恙、欣佩之餘、特電馳慰、（三）中央秘書處來電、關於懸旗事、頃准外交部復稱、本部得訊後、當向法大使館提出交涉、據答稱旗已退還、人亦釋放、復於養日提出書面抗議、要求採取必要步驟、加以糾正、並勿再干涉我居民懸旗之自由等語、特達查照、</p>
<h3>法租界力維治安</h3>
<p>法租界警務當局爲維護租界內秩序安寗、防止不逞之徒、乘機肇事起見、爰派通班中法越俄各探捕全體出勤、分段梭巡、以維治安、但因各華探全體奉派出勤、無暇兼顧特二法院出庭、報告承辦各案、故由警務處預定今日停止解訊公訴案一天、即以前解訊之舊案改期、定於今日續審者、亦皆展期審理、法院方面、今日照常進行審理者、爲民事案與刑事自訴案而已、本月一日、世界勞動節日法警務處方面亦照此辦理、是可見法租界行政與警務當局之竭全力以維護界內秩序安寗之苦心也、</p>
<h3>死傷日軍　陸續運滬</h3>
<p>昨日淸晨七時許南市民國路、又有日方軍用卡車一輛、裝載滿車死屍、聞此項屍車係來自滬杭公路方面、因最近硤石及鄷墅廟以及蘇嘉路段、曾數度發生戰事、日方死傷甚衆、其他各路游擊戰亦甚激烈、故日方於上月二十一日起、將京滬·滬杭車行時刻更改、使機車得能裝運日軍及軍火、</p>
<h3>傳陳璧君抵滬</h3>
<p>螫居河內之陳璧君、聞於前日（三日）乘機隻身蒞滬、當飛機抵大塲飛機塲時、虹口境內爲斷絕交通、日兵三步一崗、五步一哨、戒備森嚴、陳下機後、即改乘日方預備之汽車、直駛北蘇州路百老滙大厦、聞陳此來、擬吸收婦女份子、企圖組織「中國婦女救國會」、爲其夫聲援、汪陳此種妄悖舉動、必使國人唾棄、</p>
<h3>日方圖改組租界　英政府已予拒絕　發言人謂修改地皮章程　必須獲得中國政府同意</h3>
<p>美聯社倫敦四日電、英政府發言人、昨夜對於日本耍求改組上海公共租界行政、已予以拒絕、並云、英政府認爲目前滬上之行政制度、無論對日對英、均稱公允、該發言入曾論及昨日由日方外務决官澤田廉三送達駐東京英美大使之日方要求各節、</p>
<p>日方牒文要求數款</p>
<p>按要求牒文中、包括答覆英美兩國於兩月前爲日方與第三國在滬發生事件向日本提出之抗議、日政府且要求提高一般在工部局日籍人員之地位、並增加在工部局日方代表人數、此外、對於彈壓在公共租界之反日行動及恐怖黨、亦在要求之列、</p>
<p>英人捐稅二倍於日</p>
<p>英政府發言人昨晚曾以鄭重語氣聲稱、英國認爲目前上海之行政制度、極爲公允、彼對於日本所稱日本在滬投資、實質上已有增加一點、表示承認、但同時指出英人在滬所付地產稅及捐款、幾超過日人所支付者的有二倍、故在工部局方面、英日代表人數、爲五與二之比例、堪稱允當、</p>
<p>修改章程法律問題</p>
<p>英政府發言人亦著重語氣、謂修改地皮章程、必須獲得重慶中國政府之同意、方能爲之、但彼相信此種同意、恐不致於獲得、若僅由「傀儡組織」之意願、而修改地皮章程、誠恐在法律上發生問題、不能生效、</p>
<p>英日合作應有限度</p>
<p>至於日方要求對日方統制下之「大道市政府」、予以實際的承認、此間非官方相信、英國與日本、爲調節上海公共租界情形而合作之極大限度、或僅爲增加努力於控制反日運動及反日恐怖份子、</p>
<p>制裁反日已有成就</p>
<p>有數方面指稱、日本曾宣言除征服中國及沒收華人財產外、日本對華、並無土地野心、然日本現今之投資、尙未超出英國投資五與二之比例、上海工部局、曾採取積極步驟、控制反日恐怖行動、努力之　果、對於控制在日軍佔據區域內之恐怖行動及怠工等、已有相當成就</p>
<p>英人揣度日方用意</p>
<p>英方相信、日方認工部局警務方面待遇不公、乃爲最近工部局採取步驟、增進日人在警務方面之地位及代表事件未能使日滿意之結果、彼等回憶工部局方面對於警務人數、仍未滿足日方要求、又日本最近於工部局選舉時、未能獲得較多之代表人數、亦爲此間所評議及者、認爲亦原因之一、</p>
<h3>温台防守司令　特准温州復航</h3>
<p>哈納駛定被扣旅客平安　海福停駛謀福改期駛溫　德平未靠岸搭客已登陸</p>
<p>日艦集中浙東洋面、有所企圖後、浙軍事當局爲加强防務起見、對沿海各口岸暫禁通航、今因軍事佈置已竣、除准甬定綫滬定綫復航外、再准外輪復航溫州、日艦昨又扣留滬定綫哈納輪、於是海福輪決暫緩駛定、高登威金已被挾抵滬、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>德平進口人員登岸</p>
<p>意商中意公司德平輪、受寗波同鄉會之專僱，由滬駛甬辦理急救、自被阻折回上海後、前農在吳淞口外爲日艦扣留、經意國駐滬總領事交涉後、始於昨晨進口、停泊揚樹浦第二十號與第二十一號浮筒之間、至於船員及搭客、（包括派往寗波之醫生看護）、已於昨下午用小火輪、送至新關碼頭登岸、甬同鄉會特派董心琴代表歡迎、惟上岸時曾受海關稅警等檢查、公司方面、認爲該輪已恢復自由、</p>
<p>哈納赴定被迫停駛</p>
<p>本埠德商遠東公司之哈納輪、經寗波防守司令批准復航後、該輪即於昨日下午四時由滬開往定海、於昨日上午八時駛至離定海相近之「半島叉名半海」洋面時、突被駐泊該處洋面之日艦迫令停駛、並有日兵登輪檢查、直至昨日下午六時、仍未檢竣、據公司方面消息、該輪不時有電來滬、報告情形、惟是吾可以駛定、尙無確實消息、原定昨日開定之海福輪、亦已停駛退票、</p>
<p>批准外輪復航溫州</p>
<p>溫州防守司令奉令、於上月二十三日起、通知暫禁外輪出入甌江後、惟甌江之封鎖錢缺口未堵、今已奉劉總司令電准復航溫州、以利行旅、疏通貨運、各外商輪船公司接得通知後、即準備派輪復航溫州、德　禮和洋行之謀福輪、原定昨日結關、今晨開往溫州、昨已臨時改於明（六日）晨由滬直放溫州、</p>
<p>高登威金被挾抵滬</p>
<p>德商魯麟洋行行駛甬定綫之高登輪、於上月一二十日由定駛甬、在穿山洋面被日艦扣留後、滬公司曾宣稱該輪已獲釋放、停泊定海、但據新新社記者探得確悉、高登已於昨晨七時許在日艦監視下、駛入吳淞口、停泊在楊樹浦二十二號浮筒、同時並有德商亨時洋行行駛滬興綫之威金輪、在浙東海門洋面扣留、一同被挾抵滬、兩輪桅桿上均懸掛日旗、高登輪載有乘客七十三人、威金輪載有乘客十二人、均於昨日下午四時釋放、由日方派小火輪送至新關碼頭登岸、兩公司已將經過情形、報告德領署、向日方交涉釋放、並據高登輪乘客語新新社記者、當高登輪於卅日晨十時許駛抵穿山洋面時、即遭日艦搜查、有靑年乘客一名的二十餘歲、身穿武裝致遭日軍扣留、由日艦運滬、</p>
<h3>偽鈔繳付關稅　領團强硬反對</h3>
<p>傳海關將頒使用偽鈔條例　惟美國商會方面否認其說</p>
<p>大陸報云、昨（三日）晚自可靠方面探悉、利用新發行僞鈔繳付關稅之談判、今在進行中、此乃引起國懸大爭論之豫兆也、據透露、此間日常局刻正向各有關機關施加巨大壓力、迫海關立即使用日方卵翼下之華興商業銀行紙幣、但聞此間領事團對於此舉、刻正作</p>
<p>强硬反對</p>
<p>海關人員昨日吾認知悉此舉、但某著名紙類入口商語記者云、其海關掮客頃已向彼預先通知、立即獲得新僞鈔、以繳付其關稅云、記者復叩諸其他海關掮客、據稱、海關未發正式通告、但彼等已得「口頭通知」、謂「甚近之將來」、即將頒佈關於使用</p>
<p>偽鈔規例</p>

<p>平衡市價</p>
<p>該業公會昨發平衡市價通告云、爲通告事、查本業來貨、近被虹口「牲畜市塲」攔扣、以致販運者相率裹足、來源缺乏、若因此任意抬高市價、實非本業維持肉食之至意、自應平衡市價、最高不得超過業經公定之限度、共維本業公平交易、顧全民食之旨、合仰各行共體斯意、協同辦理是爲至要、特此通告、</p>

<p>成績昭著</p>
<p>開辦迄今、時才四月、而對於所內收容管理設施諸要端、擘畫周詳、有條不紊、類如籌備兒童教育、培養難胞技能、從事生產、注重消防、以及講求衛生、防杜疾疫等、甚至爲調劑難胞精神、設有播音室、闢有娛樂室、解除難胞苦悶、均已决第實行、不遺餘力、且其所手定之訓條八則、如不徇私、不包庇、不營私、不舞弊不飲酒、不吸烟、不賭博、不鬥毆、允能躬行實踐、爲全所職員全所難胞表率、故其職員及難胞、盡能奉公守法、允見上行下效、捷於影響之微騐、溯自軍興以來、滬上難民、多如蟻聚、全滬收容所、亦如雨後春筍、供此非常時期之需要、而欲求其首屈一指、爲各收容所之模範、則非該所莫屬、</p>

<h3>日政府此後多年內　將不斷發行公債</h3>
<p>每年至少發廿萬萬元　或有五十萬萬元可能</p>

<p>日本銀行</p>
<p>估計爲四萬八千萬元、故本年最初四個月之不足額、已達十二萬八千五百萬元、同期中日收府所發新公債、超過此不足額、共計已發新公債十叫萬三千萬元、日方官塲報告則稱、此等公債、已全數被吸收、但實際上、日本公衆承購此項公債數額、</p>
<p>較前為少</p>
<p>新公僓之百分之四十三、山大藏省儲蓄部收下、而强令日本各儲蓄銀行吸收、餘者由日本銀行收入、但不得不將新公僓之大部份交其他各銀行吸收、至於個人方面增加對國僓之投資、表示甚少之關切</p>

<h3>各地學生在四川</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>生活簡單好像寺院的僧眾　日出到日落他們工作不息　不怕轟炸自己建有避彈室　上課用號角軍隊氣氛充溢</p>
<p>中國教育機關的一半，被日本的炸彈所殴滅，而現在成為廢墟了。剩餘的建築，被日本軍隊佔據着。留有的書籍和器物，不是彼掠奪去，就是被焚燒掉。</p>
<p>他們把大學校和高等學校毁滅，但是中國的教育却在進步，政府和促進教育的人，他們工作得比以前更努力。</p>
<p>『當我目觀日本的炸彈像雨落一樣的把我們的校址毀滅時，』中央大學的的校長雜家倫圾近對外籍记者說：『我誓言每一所校舍被他們毀滅了，要建造起兩所；每一個小時被屠殺了，我們可以應得十個以上，這是我們對日本毁滅我們的大學的答覆。』</p>
<p>這種不屈不撓的精神，已由中央大學畜牧部通過全國，慢慢的移向內地而證實。牛，羊，和猪，一隊隊的驅往內地，經過幾百英里的路程，一年之後，終於到了預定的地點，沒有喪失一頭。</p>
<p>中央大學在重慶的郊外，費時四十二天，建成了新校舍。全部的建築在五十間房屋以上，安排打南京移往内地的三千學生和教授團。</p>
<p>校舍和宿舍造在嘉陵江旁邊的山麓上面，是粗糙的木房子，怛簡單而清潔。學生便他們適應四周的環境，生活很清苦，服裝又樸素。據說每一學生，每年所費，不超過二百五十元。</p>
<p>沒有錢的學生-來自戰區的避難者-不必為學費而担心。聰明的設有獎學金額，其他每月可發給貸款八元，六塊錢膳費，雨塊錢雜用，-他們所需耍的也盡在於此了。</p>
<p>在一間會食堂內，足客一千學生進餐，兩組糙的碗碟，大桶內盛涵了蒸熟的飯，放在飯堂中的通路上。這種青年學生，生活的簡單，正可和住在寺院裏的和尚相比擬。</p>
<p>然而在大學裏的生活是很恬靜，學生自日出到日落，工作不息。在小工廠裹，他們用日本人手裏搶回來的機器和工具作工。在藝術室裏，有若干學生正在繪宣傳的壁畫。彩色和生動的圖畫，掛在四壁，當做畫室的裝飾．在松山（譯者）的卜面，新屋很快的建築起來，那邊就是中大的校舍，預備下學期可容納更多的新生。</p>
<p>據中國政府的對外宣稱：自戰事發生而後，救濟五萬五千學生，一萬五千為戰事失業的大學教授，教員，和從事教育工作者，會用去五百萬的救濟費。根據教育部最近所發表的消息：在戰區之中，被日本所毀滅的高等學校，移往內地的已有五十三所，學校的一部分移往到內地的十七所，另外有二所正在向內地遷移，八所還是在日本的佔領區內活動。</p>
<p>同時，教育部又發表消息，說是自戰事發生以後，內地新添了五所大學和工藝學校；在戰前，那些地方祗有八個高等學校。現在四川，在内地各省之中，已企戰區學校遷往的最多的一省了。</p>
<p>像中央大學一樣，灭津的南開大學，也移往內地。但該校的校長張伯芬和他的同人，比其他的教育家眼光看得更遠，在日本侵入華北的時候，他們早已看到。一九三六年，盧構橋事件發生前一年，一個新的校址早巳選定了。</p>
<p>五十萬元的經費，內中五萬元由蔣委員長捐膾的，建築的工作也在開始了。一年之後，戰事爆發，他們的學校被日本的燃燒彈毀滅無餘，他們走了一千英里路才到四川。現在有一千叫百學生在南開讀書，他們之中，三分之二是打戰區逃來的，他們會親眼看見他們的學校和家被日本人所毀滅。這些男女學生，是極端的愛國主義者，他們封於國家的福利，能夠盡職。最近實行獻金競賽時，這些小國民，自己衣袋裏會拿出一萬七干元來供献國家。</p>
<p>全部校舍的外形，好像一個軍營，每一個學生，不拘男女，都穿制服。女學生的穿制服者，在操場上嚴密的操練。男學生穿了軍服，聚在一起，由一位軍官教導他們怎樣放射中國製造的機關槍。其他在大操場上打籃球和踢足球。上課用號角代替銅鐘，召集學生進入課室．使這個學校，軍隊的氣氛更是充溢。</p>
<p>中大和南開，雖然和城市都離得很遠，然而他們不怕日本飛機的轟炸，兩個學校自己都建有避彈室。在南開，他們更有自己的警報。日本飛機過往轟炸他們原來的學校，使學生留有一個深刻的印象。青年們都熱烈的愛好航空，大多研究航空的科目，中國的空軍之中，有六十個航空員過往是南開的畢業生。</p>
<p>『等到中國和平再見時』，羅校長說：『我們將回到南京。』但所有這些大學校和高等學校，都要留在内地。中國的教育機關，將會兩倍於中日發生戰事以前。</p>
<p>——譯自大陸報星期刊——</p>
<h3>轟炸</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>臨陣打仗的人們，天然不怕飛機炸彈，最怕飛機炸彈的，莫過於平民，而他們偏要去轟炸我們的平民，我不知他們與我人民何仇！而出此慘無人道的手段？</p>
<p>他們的戰士身畔，多有某某神社的護身符，猜測他們的意思，無非欲求神靈來保佑，我不知此種殘忍的戰士們，神靈是否肯替他們保護，其間還有問題。</p>
<p>假定神果有靈，我想必有受其報者。</p>
<h3>［女壯士」觀感</h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>蘇聯第一不彩色片　滬光大戲院開映</p>
<p>在中國觀眾面前，奠定了蘇聯影片的基礎的是『生路』。那並不是因為『生路』是在中國開映的第一張影片，而是因為那雄厚闊大的作風；這作風是會影響了好萊塢的，而在草創中的中國電影界，則影響更大。</p>
<p>現在是愛克牙奴克維赤繼生路之後的第一部影片『夜鶯曲」現譯『女壯士』）又到中國來了；和『生路』之為蘇聯的笫一部有聲影片同樣，這部『女壯士』是蘇聯的第一部彩色片，它的主角雖祇紅藍二色，以致不能把物體的各種顏色都層次地傳達出來，尤其处在動作中，顏色顯得有點模糊，但像那些靜的畫面，如幾次風景的介紹以及花瓶中的玫瑰花，則它的美麗較之於美國的五彩片，實際上也並不多讓，其它如火熄的那場戲，則那熊熊的火燄和他的影子，在攝影的技術上也有很大的成就。</p>
<p>導演手腕，也見優越，尤其是每場戲中的『織接』的運川，我們是可以舉出許多使人佩服的地方，例如：新工廠落成，女工們被迫參加慶祝典禮，格魯娘代表呈獻處有廠主肖像的花瓶那場戲裏，愛克用狗的特寫來代表工頭的表情，他就運用得非常確當：又如：工潮爆發，推定格魯娘到屋顶去發信號，格魯娘臂上中槍，掙扎着用頭巾包紮了傷處，血　出來把頭巾染成紅色，她到了屋頂就用這血的旗幟來作寫信號，這聰明也是使人佩服的，而中槍後血跡一點點的加重，較之一般好萊塢電影的中槍後繼以一大堆血的特寫者，也真實而且有力得多；又如女工們用磁器出擊的享樂場面，無論是　國或他的氣氛，也絕非一股的美國電影可比。類此的例子我们還可舉出很多，但為了篇幅，祗能從略了。</p>
<p>『女壯士」的故事是一九一〇至一九二一年間的［革命的前夜中的一段史實，這是許多的英勇的革命工潮之一，雖然其中　有一點改　，但大體上則還是非常　實。</p>
<p>這一部片子在蘇聯和在中國開映，當然其意義是不同的，那麼，在此時此地開映，它會使我們得些什麼呢？也即是說，它的客觀效果如何呢？</p>
<p>有一位朋友看到那些女王們被迫穿了新衣服（衣料是预發的，費用在薪水項下扣除）歌唱和呈獻花瓶以慶祝新廠落成時，他歷經的向我說，這使他連想到某些『滑稽人物』的所带『慶祝式』；然而我所更為感動的則是那些英勇的女工決定以她們手頭晌磁器，作為進攻的武器，和機師用他無比的勇敢把憲兵們送上『歸路』。這是血的教訓，也是活的課本，即使手無寸鐵，而步伐一致的英勇的　眾，利用了他們手頭的工具，也終於戰勝了他們的敵人！</p>
<p>伊萬賽娃的歌喉比她的演技來得好，而演喜悅的場血，也比演悲苦的場面来得擅長，演廠主的阿達洛夫和演工頭的柯　哥夫，都有很好的成績，尤其是阿達洛夫，他在新工廠落成的這場戲裏，是演得非常難能可貴的。</p>
<p>敢把這張蘇聯的彩色片介紹給親愛的讀者，那不但是因為這是第一張蘇聯的彩色片，可以使對電影藝術有興趣的作他山之錯，主要的，則是為了這裏有活的教訓。</p>
<p>正片之錢的那張『猶太人的自治區』新聞片。也頗值得一觀。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第九回　含悲茹苦淚灑四廂　崇儉習勞體勤十畝</p>
<p>到那時，有這許多世界各國的人，到中國來。要看看中國究竟進步到如何程度，却不能一時游歷中國全部，我們就可以開電影給他們瞧。所以到那時，我們在世界運動會的會裏，也要造一座廣大的電影院。不過那都是明年的事，而在今年已在開始媒　起來了，。今天東吳大學開映的幾張新聞短片，大都是關於學術上的。也有幾張風景片，那都是彩色的。關於公益事業的短片，近來也攝得不少。就是朱愛人等所辩的育嬰院，也因為有那三位小天使的緣故，很有電影公司要來請求攝取電影。但老章醫師不願宣傳。都謝絕了他們。雖然如此，將來送往紐約世界博覽會去的新聞片中，要表揚中國所辦育嬰事業的成功，而且有這一胎三兒的緣故，恐怕還是要來攝影。中央電影局的的局長，已經向老章醫師来請求過，現在正在接洽中咧。加以老章醫師美國有許多朋友，他們也都要看看，這個育婴院的成績，老章醫師也不好拒絕吧？此刻吳君素兩姊妹，陪着朱愛人，金澹雲，何家兩姊妹等，也吃完了飯，即到劇場中來。劇場中人已坐滿了，到了七點三刻，便先開映新聞電影。約映一個鐘頭，略為休息，便戲劇開始。先由一位導演先生，走至幕前，謙遜了幾句。大意說：劇中有許麥不妥善，不完美的地方，要請諸君盡情指教，庶可改良的話。來這位導演先生姓余，在話劇界也算是老資格了。他現在年紀也不過四十多歲，在年青時代，着實為了喚起國民，從事抗戰，而到處演劇，很吃國了不少苦頭。當時他也當過電影從業員。中國在戰前的電影界，實在幼稚得很。凡是在電影界演過電影，稍有名氣的人，都稱之為電影明星。尤其是女演員，只要在銀幕上一現影，便是一個電影明星。那時這位余先生，雖然是位男演員，也有明星之稱。不國他們都是有志青年，他们除電影外，也演話劇。民國二十六年八月十三日的前夜，他們正在演着劇名『保衛盧溝橋』的一齣富於煽動性的話劇，不想到明天上海發起了比盧溝橋更洪亮的砲聲來了。（一○一）</p>

<h3>得道者多助</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>國際間的縱橫俾圖，固然以利害爲前提，不會拘拘於道義。然而公道自在人心，道義的影響，究竟是有的：對於有道的國家，如果於其本身有利，當然會盡力援助，即使於其本身無利，却也無害（有道的國家常然無害於人），至少便會守着嚴正的中立，不至落井下石，助桀爲虐。</p>
<p>英美法蘇的援助中國，就可以歸入前者的一項，而世界上除了只某一國侵略中國以外，其他各國雖不援助中國，也不見得壓迫中國，便可以歸入後者的一項。這沒有別的原故，就因爲中國是無辜被害者，被侵略者。，中國在奮鬥，在掙扎；中國的遭遇是動人同情的，而中國的作爲是應天順人的，換言之，中國是得道的：得道者多助；多助之至，自然天下歸之！甚至與侵略者一鼻孔出氣的德國，也曾和中國訂定彼此有利的商業條的，中國得助之多，更可以從這一點上見出來。</p>
<p>最近，除了英國的繼續積極援助中國，時受某方的指摘以外，美國更有露骨的表示，據華盛頓的哈瓦斯社說，美國全國商業聯合會舉行突會時，甚至有人說，一遇有必要時，不惜訴諸戰事。」他們極願中國「保持獨立主權」，成爲他們「未來的首耍主顧」，所以他們要保護對中國的貿易，而不爲任何侵略國所封鎖。他們對中國的抗戰，是有完全同情的。</p>
<p>同時，美國駐華大使詹森在舊金山所發表的談話，也是大有助於中國。他相信「中國方面，糧食衣服，均甚豐富，且民氣亦極激昂，」而以爲「日機恣意轟炸中國民衆居住之中心點，徒使中國人民對日之敵愾，益爲增高。」中國人民，在寗波重慶連日被轟炸的環境下，看到這種談話，恐怕不但感慨，直是感激吧！中國的痛苦是有人關心的，而這關心却又出於完全的了解與好意。</p>
<p>不過他國的援助中國，中國固可引以自慰，却又不可因以自懈。「天助目助者」正可以改作「人助自助者」。中國還當在正義上始終奮勉下去，竭盡一分一毫的自助力量！</p>
<h3>火</h3>
<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>—徐州突圍回憶記—</p>
<p>看着那無法撲滅的大火，貪饞的把徐三村吞蝕去，幾個沒有跑開的老人號哭着，在那火海裏掙扎着，我心裹像給什麼刺痛着似的，忍不住忿忿了</p>
<p>「好，炸得好，血債是要用血債來還的！」</p>
<p>天晚了，晚風一陣一陣的吹了來，那火海越發洶湧着，咆哮着，黑烟一團一團的滾了起來，火燄也隨着升高起來，向天空餂着。……運天空也給餂得那末火紅紅的。</p>
<p>已經陷在敵人的重圍中的人馬、齋集在村莊外，把無法帶走的迫擊砲彈分配拿着了，便沿着一條鬆軟的土路，浩浩蕩蕩的向前行進。黃灰可怕的飛揚着，人被嗆得不住的咳着嗽，馬隊從隊伍的旁邊，掀起了一片灰土，不客氣的搶着趕上前去。人，一個跟一個的急急的在走着，有時，距離大了，便放開脚步，飛跑着趕上前去。</p>
<p>已經走了十多里了，回頭看了一看徐三村：那火海仍是那末洶湧着，咆哮着，怪怕人的！</p>
<p>夜色籠罩着大地上了，四周是什麼地方也不知道，路是那末高低不平的，但兩隻脚却像走熟了似的，大步大步的只管踏去。</p>
<p>我們走到了一個不知呌什麼名字的鎭市，給敵機炸毀完了，一個老百姓也不見。常踏着瓦礫走過這荒凉死滅了的鎭市時，一間殘餘的房子還在冒着黑烟，但沒有人來救，火貪饞的只是燒着。</p>
<p>大家的心裏充滿了忿恨，悲哀，……默默的只是向着無盡的大路上走。</p>
<p>前面父是一片怕人的通紅的火光，漆黑的天空映得那末燦爛明亮，被黑暗吞蝕去了的一些小村莊，也淸楚的現出來了。</p>
<p>沿着公路，向着那通紅的目標走去，到了那火海的旁邊，只見一個村莊又完了！</p>
<p>一呵，瘋在的强盜呀，這仇恨是不能忘記的，你的殘暴不但毀滅不了中國，而且將使你越發快快的走向墳墓裏去！」不停的走着，被睡限襲擊着的人，爽性跑到田野裏，公路旁，不顧一切的零亂的睡着，但大部份人馬仍繼續前進。</p>
<p>像沒有止境似的，過了一個村莊又一個村莊。疼痛着的兩隻脚軟得　提起來，口渴得要命，但仍得走。</p>
<p>天亮了，心裏想宿營地總快要到了。已經疲乏得難支持下去的身子，還鼓着最後的一點力氣，向前走去，希望到了宿營地可以滿足難耐的飢渴，不想走到十點多鐘，宿營地的屠莊還不知在那裏。</p>
<p>「唉，拖死人了！」</p>
<p>「走，不走在這裏怎麼辦？」</p>
<p>一路上盡是掉隊的人，沒頭的走着，到了夾溝鎮，滿想沒有飯吃也總可以喝一口水，不想這裏已給敵機轟炸平了。</p>
<p>帶着失望的心情，拖着癱軟的脚步，一顚一拐的繞到了津浦鐵路的夾溝車站。這裏還停着一輛殭死了的火車，車內滿是貨物，行李，還有兩挺機關槍和不少的子彈。</p>
<p>車站上似乎早沒有人了，冷落得有些可怕。跨過了津浦鐵路，正想向前面走去時，忽然前面的山頂上響起了猛烈的砲聲：</p>
<p>——轟隆！</p>
<p>——轟隆！</p>
<p>但我們不管，仍向我們的目的地前進。</p>
<h3>瞄准（木刻）</h3>
<p>— 蘇黎</p>
<h3>談餘</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>白櫻先生對於繙譯工作的意見，我充份表示同意。的確，現在從事繙譯的人雖不少，却不免有許多浪費心力物力而不能格外增加效能的地方。假使有一個聯絡組織，共同商討，我想就一定有許多進步。我希望白櫻先生肯作這事的發起人，而所有從事繙譯的人都全加入。</p>
<h3>我們是年青人</h3>
<p>— 秉權</p>
<p>現在湧在我眼前的是無數火般紅的愉快的純眞的年靑人底臉；襯着這許多臉的背景是寬曠的原野，是穹形的深遠的靑天。充滿了生命力的熟情的呼聲，從他們的嘴裏喊出來，在這偉大的塲面上傳散者；……漸漸的，他門都散去了，烽火般擁向別一角落去燃燒，但呼聲的餘音還淸晰的回響着，繚繞着。</p>
<p>我沈在甜的幻想中。</p>
<p>門的響聲震碎了我的平靜的夢，進來的是一個和我同樣年靑的人。熱情的光采在他臉上消失了，堆着一片悽苦荒凉的暗影</p>
<p>我們誰也沒有說話，沈默的對坐着；就這樣的聽時間的足音平穩的在遼遠但又似乎很近之處消失了去。終於他張開了嘴。</p>
<p>我敏感的想着別的，只看見他的嘴脣在上下的模糊的移動着；但我不用接觸到他的聲音，也能明白他說的是什麼，因爲我已經聽過無數遍了，他在　　訴說着他的痛苦。</p>
<p>『你很痛苦吧，』我說</p>
<p>『晤，……』</p>
<p>『……』</p>
<p>『你不也和我一樣嗎？』他激動的說。</p>
<p>是的，我正也和他一樣的痛苦呵！我們又靜靜的對坐着了。但當一顆小的火花——生命的火花——在我的心底深處燃燒起來的時候，我擾破了死寂的威脅，猛的跳了起來：</p>
<p>『自然，別的一些兄弟們，他們正在過着比我們愉悅而偉大的生活；我們却被丟在黑暗的荒野裏。但這樣我們就絕望，就應該讓自已腐化了去嗎？……晤，不能的！……』</p>
<p>他很驚訝了一下。他緊握了我的手。我看見他眼裏亮着兩腔熱淚，紅潤的色彩很快的把他的雙頤勾上了一個明快的輪廓。</p>
<p>『有生命的有信仰的人決不會在潮濕的壞環境裏生銹的，我們應該堅强的鬥爭着！』一個淸楚的聲音在朗朗的響着。</p>
<h3>談談翻譯工作</h3>
<p>— 白櫻</p>
<p>——向翻譯工作者建議——</p>
<p>近一年來上海出版界有一個很値得在意的現象，即翻譯工作的發達。每一份報紙，雜誌，幾乎都有翻譯的作品，在有些刊物上，翻譯的東西量質方面均佔得相當多，而單行本的書中，譯本恐怕更比一般的創作『暢銷』。各報甚多有單爲翻譯闢專欄的。</p>
<p>這種現象，如果坦直承認中國的近代文化確是比較地落後，那就是很可慶幸的現象。而且翻譯工作就溝通文化言，還是一件非常重要而切要的工作。允其在抗戰中的今日，對於外人對華的同情與論，國際局勢的正確分析，戰地外國記者及觀察家的現地報告，以及外人所搜集的抗戰史料等等，在在可以於我們精神上以及實質上（如情報）的帮助。而上海翻譯工作者所介紹的文字，也多半不出上述範圍。</p>
<p>有人說翻譯工作只是依人作嫁，好像只要懂得外國文字，卽可輕易爲之。其實我想翻譯工作並不那樣簡單，拋開技術上的種種不談，翻譯工作者本身的思想，是其工作有吾現實價値的先決問題。僅僅具有文字上的技術，缺乏正確的意識，那麼介紹出來的譯作，也一定不能正確到那裹。傀儡報紙和傀儡雜誌上，也有譯作發表，在文字上也多半可以讀得通，然其總不失爲傀儡工作。因此譯者的思想問題，是決定其譯作價値的先決問題。</p>
<p>再决就是譯者的學識。學識雖然包括翻譯技術在內，但學識不是僅僅技術。在翻譯工作者允其如此。其他的專門技術家，同時也是這一部門的知識專家，例如土木工程師，電氣工程師，他們的知識範圍不妨專長於其所習技能的部門。而翻譯工作者固然也可以專翻文學，政治，經濟，科學或其他等等專類。可是在現狀下，翻譯者的工作，不得暫時担任一下文化界的Mlinister　at　large的任務。這原因可歸納到自社會的客觀需要以至譯者的個人生活問題。因此目前的譯作工作者，在學識方面應該力謀進修。他像外交官的Minister　at　Iarge，在學識上縱做不到一個「深」字，但至少要有某種程度的「博」。而技術問題，也可放在這「博」字上面去決定。</p>
<p>以上兩點，是從事翻譯工作者在文字技術外的最基本條件。目前上海從事翻譯工作的者，可謂相當多，在思想方面，以抗戰第一主義來評衡，在大體上是可以令人滿意的。不過觀點未免太偏向一些，譬如像斯諾及其夫人，斯沫特萊，勃脫蘭，不併及其他有名外國作家的東西，一經出版，便互相搶譯。（例如勃脫蘭的『華北前綫』一書，現在聽說有五方面在譯）這種現象是有利有弊的：一方面固可看出譯者都有正確的限光，但迢里除了思想的眼光以外，恐怕還不免有生意眼，而其結果便是精力與物力的浪費。實際上除了在中國既成名作家的東西外，好的作品還多得很，不過翻譯工作者間缺乏聯絡，因此大家的眼允只注意於幾個有名作家的東西，而忽略了其他的，甚至同一篇東西在報張雜誌上一再炒冷飯。要糾正這種現象，根本的辦法，是翻譯工作人員間應當有個聯絡組織。就是從學識言，一人總不如羣力。雖然是Mlinisterat　Iarge，可是總不是萬賣全書。如專門名宇的統一，譯文的商榷，在在需要工作人員的互相研究討論。</p>
<p>因限於篇幅，不能一下說盡。但如果承認現階段的翻譯工作是搆成整個抗戰文化的一個要素，則爲求翻譯工作的發展圓滿起見，翻譯工作者間有成立一個互助組織的必要。</p>

<h3>四萬萬同胞　在美開映</h3>
<p>— （蟾）</p>
<p>最近在紐的著名戲院開映的『四萬萬同胞』影片，轟動了整個的紐的城，差不多映了二星期還每塲客滿。</p>
<p>這張影片記錄着中國抗戰的一切情形，前綫的生活，後方的動態，都活躍在鏡頭裹。攝製人是極有經騐的喬理斯伊文，他在三年前曾以拍攝『西班牙的土地』一張新聞長片而名重一時，是美國最著名的新聞攝影師之一。</p>
<p>這張影片的攝製是非常困難的，在中國，喬氏發現他所需耍的材料是散佈在各處各地方，他每大至少要跑八十多里路。在西班牙，他只要住在馬德里的旅館裏，聽見了砲聲再出發，在一刻鐘之內就可到前綫，拿攝影機開拍。但在中國呢，戰塲是那麼廣闊遼遠，所以常常要費掉一星期的時間才能逢到一段好的材料。「克復台兒莊」這一塲大戰的鏡頭，他也是費了許多心血冒了絕大的危險才獲得的。</p>
<p>當今年三月裹這張影片在紐的公映時，他曾應新聞記者的邀請，發表了他的工作情形和感想，下面是他報告中的一段：</p>
<p>『……關於中國，許多美國人僅知道它是一塊廣大無垠的土地，住着無數飽嘗勞苦的人民而已。因此，我攝製這部影片的第一個目的便是要深入中國內地，帶一些眞實的東西回來，讓觀衆們看到中國的眞面目，他們的領袖和民衆，以及他們在這决抗戰中的英勇姿態，而把一般人對於中國的浮面觀念一掃而空。我可以相信，我拍攝這部影片並不失敗，觀衆們一定會在本片中看到中國民衆的英勇戰鬥之後而感到驚異和興奮，而將舊有的成見推翻，……這部影片的一切，我都沒有虛飾，我是記錄了眞實……』。</p>
<p>附帶要告訴的這張影片的說明是由著名明星茀特立瑪區担任的。</p>

<h3>藝術界的大義賣</h3>
<p>— 杭穉英</p>
<p>救濟事業似乎不是商業美術家和工藝美術家所做的事情，一般人都是這樣想，他們的見解是根據他們積累下來的觀念—商業美術家工藝美術家和社會是無關聯性的。</p>
<p>中國工商業美術作家協會，現在正在配合了全上海的國畫家西畫彫塑家藝術攝影家古玩收藏家繼續著積極發動了美術界大義賣。義賣籌備進行，我們根據去年寒衣展的經騐，改進了六點：（一）我們把籌備的期間延長到一個半月，多徵集一些簇新的美術工藝品，尤其注意的是應該提倡的手工藝品；（二）我們把甲種（全捐）乙種（半捐）兩種性質不同的出品，用彩色不同的標籤標明，可以表明捐者仁德之懷，（三）我們把出品標價儘量抑低，可以使義買者樂於參加，出品普遍睨售；（四）我們不售門票，不募雜捐，注重於義賣而不勸買，（五）所徵集之精品分十五日十八日兩决陳列，俾後來者不致向隅；（六）我們把籌備時間和開幕以後的經費儘量撙節。</p>
<p>我們除了改進以上六點外，當選大義賣籌委的自主席委員以下及各組榦事，都是犧牲了職業上的收入來出品於義賣和義務服務於義賣，動員了整個的集團；可以說，我們美術家有的幾分熱，就發了幾分光</p>
<p>我們的目標，並不單單求我們所發動的大義賣成績出色，放了一個單聲砲；我們的最大希望，是希望上海的人民將人人知其責任，人人參加義賣，義賣普遍到了都市每一個角落裏。（義賣獻金）</p>
<h3>王又宸死後托兆記（下）</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>（編者按）本文所述王又宸遺聞軼事，頗有興趣，故樂爲之刊登。如以科學頭腦測之，則托兆之說，跡近迷信，蘇先生此作，無非追念老友之意，當非提倡迷信也。</p>
<p>二十一年予重遊北平，又宸夫婦的予至其家，酒飯快談數日，別後，又六年不晤矣。去冬之夜，予朦朧中見又宸，裝東似連營寨中之劉先主，彼固以此劇著名者。向予云。。「吾今以一子相託，請念舊交勿辭」。他語不復記，醒後乃知是南柯一夢，不知又宸已死也。後十餘日，各報載其死訊，病只三日不救，然則前夢眞又宸之魂來耶？奇矣！又宸得年五十六，長子名某，幼習英文，早入政界，决子習戲，工武老生，名不甚彰，彼所託者，其此子耶？他日遇有機會，必有以副老友九泉下之望焉。</p>
<p>又宸美姿容，溫文類儒生，故演打棍出箱捉放曹空城計等、扮相皆合身分。彼之打泡戲上上三戲爲多，其嗓昔特佳，吃正工調，高寬亮兼備，疙瘩音允爲便利，多而且大，有用得不當之處，有人以是譏之。吾嘗謂又宸之聲帶，比之最嫩最良最縐之笛膜，聲音美聽聞，然一吹便響，有不可控縱之勢，固第一等嗓音也。初學於陳福勝先生，（予亦從學，爲先後同門，如時慧寳孟小茹等皆陳之弟子），後專摩譚調，其唱得老調者多，以譚蓋面，骨子內欠剛勁，此其性情天分使然，非人力可能爲。字音工力雖不逮余叔岩言菊朋二人，而唱法固守典型，不屑杜撰，試聽其唱片，可證予言之不謬其大方平穩處，非餘子所能及也。其拿手戲，依予决第，以瓊林宴爲第一，空城計第二，連營寨第三，碰碑等則中品，若捉放曹又宸每唱必脫板或忘詞，予見其鬧錯凡三决，又宸每鬧錯，必呼鬧鬼兒不置，是亦又宸遺事笑話之一，彼九泉有知，想亦將爲之一笑也。</p>

<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>民國後伶人身抬高的原因</p>
<p>（三）蘇督馮國璋邀孫菊仙蒞寗演振災義務戲三天、民國五年，馮任蘇督，齊耀琳任省長，王桂林爲江寗警察廳長，馮是河間府人，齊王又都是天津人，其實齊爲東三省人，惟以其全家住津多年，故亦可謂爲津人。因此督署省長公署以及警察廳裏的官佐職員，也以直隸省人爲最多。那年適逢該省水災，所以這般旅寗的直隸同鄕，就發起了一個振災會，並專人赴津，聘請梨園前輩孫菊仙南下，在內橋的慶樂茶園裏連演義務戲三天，掛牌時就以「老鄕親」三字，金字書寫，貼於各大通衢的牆壁上，票價特售兩元，在常時就是駭人聽聞的創舉了。老孫彼時　已年近七旬，帶起寗口來，樂經露出他原來的蒼白鬍鬚，然而精神矍鑠，走起臺步來，依然邁着大方步，看他好像祇有五十多歲的光景。至於他那三日的戲碼，就是「硃砂痣」逍遙津」「魚藏劍」，唱時無不滿宮滿調，大氣磅礡，在他第一日登臺之前，先有督署的高級官佐，代表馮督向觀衆演說，對於孫氏的人格藝術，無不推崇備至，而他此决來寗演戲，爲桑梓籌款助振，允對孫氏年事已高，不辭勞瘁，跋涉長途，表示特別的欽敬。戲畢後，馮齊諸氏，各備盛宴款待，敬如上賓，絕不以其爲梨園中人，而稍存卑賤心理。孫氏北返時，各署官佐，多至江干送別，其盛况儼如冠蓋往來中要人之行動，此爲伶人身價提高之又一明證也。</p>
<p>（四）魯督張宗昌舉行閱兵大典竟偕程硯秋陪觀民國十四年的雙十節，畏腿將軍舉行三日慶祝戲，常時名伶到濟參加的計有暢小樓，余叔岩，梅蘭芳，王鳳卿，尙小雲，荀慧生，稈硯秋，小翠花，李萬春，王長林等。那時硯秋在一般旦角裏，年紀最輕，（的二十一二歲）身個也不像現在這樣肥碩，說起話來又非常文雅，彷彿同妙齡的女子一樣，所以張將軍就特別垂靑於他，不但賞賜優厚，並且行坐不離。最可怪的，就是國慶日舉行閱兵典禮時，老張居然也把硯秋帶着，令他站在身旁。實上不啻姊行母令，比聞「神秘夫人」已攝竣，聞路明在是片中喚琴芳「媽媽」甚使觀者動容云。</p>
<p>在洋復歸藝華　在洋，即錢愛華也，明眸酷齒，頗肖美國影星瓊派克，曾一度下海伴舞，近復歸藝華工作甚忙，蓋「三集化身姑娘」及「燕子盜」二片均有其重要演出也。</p>

<h3>普求換立和約</h3>
<p>（見遜淸同治十一年五月份本報）</p>
<p>中國與普魯斯叫立和的，現已將屆滿期，故普國欽使已告明總理衙門云：「敝邦與貴朝，和好久敦，挿血之書，載在盟府，誠宜永遠遵守，用示子孫。今舊的將屆滿期，新的尙未議行，吾兩國之金書玉冊，豈可久懸乎云云。一觀普欽使之意，必欲與中國換立和的也。</p>
<h3>華工被販出口</h3>
<p>距皮魯國不還有一海島，蕪穢不治，遍積鳥糞；皮魯人因難墾闢，逼令在皮魯之華工赴島中掘糞，穢氣薰蒸，嵐毒侵虐，不及年餘，其人必死。雖曰原有辛工八元之外，另加二元；夫人豈以二元之事，而赴死地者乎！此華工困苦之情狀也。至於澳門之販猪他者，則以誘來之人，賣與船主，其價則每名五六十元耳。船主至皮魯後，每人可得三四百元；除所給販者五六十元及路費七十元外，則每名可得洋銀二百餘元不等。若載有三四百人，則其生意，頗有可觀者矣，故其於澳門經理販人之事，不遺一分之餘力，而亦不留一點之良心也。亦有愚人之甘心願往者，蓋不知彼國之悄形與工人之狀况耳。八元之工錢，在中土不可謂薄；在該國飲食服用之費，雖每月受二三十元者，尙不能有所竄餘，僅受八元者，其爲刻苦，又當何如耶。况至該地，尙有逼令赴島上掘糞之虐政乎。木年有猪仔船一隻，遇風泊於日本海岸，已知內幕之仔猪，紛紛投水，欲望一綫之生，此案於是得破。將來水落日出，當向皮魯提出嚴峻之交涉云。</p>

<p>自晨每條十兩、初開因某銀樓代港幫與其他銀樓等買意蓬勃、市勢頗堅、首由某銀樓進證券幫五十兩、二千一百十七元為開盤價、較之前收做高八元、開後銀樓幫進某錢兌業五十元、價十九元、繼之某銀樓亦代港幫吸購某錢兌業百兩、價則相同、此後銀樓幫仍來吸購、但以天津幫托錢兌業與證券幫猛塞不怠、足以頭寸頓感供過於求、遂傾向下跌、錢兌業賣予銀樓幫五十兩、價十六元、後錢兌業又與證券幫相繼售與銀樓幫共百兩、價均十二元、其時某錢兌業亦加入賣方、故更不支、某錢兌業賣予銀樓幫五十兩、價十元、時銀樓幫止進、目賣方售意更切、當又銳跌八元、某錢兌業與證券幫互相塞予某金號各五十兩、價竟退至〇二元、後銀樓幫買意復萌、故遂重向上騰、某金號進證券幫五十兩、價〇七元、銀樓幫進錢兌業五十兩、價〇八元、又進錢兌業五十兩、價十二元、時某金號獲利脫售、金價下挫、吐予銀樓幫共百兩、價均十兩、錢兌業賣予某錢兌業五十兩、價〇八元、證券幫塞予銀樓幫五十兩、價〇四元、某錢兌業獲利復進、錢兌業與證券幫各五十兩、價〇五元、時已正午、後因某金號　復吸購、形勢稍堅、首進錢兌業五十兩、價〇七元、後又進錢兌業五十兩、價一躍為十一元、（出者仍天津幫吐售）、此後錢兌業與證券幫仍有供意、但因金號及銀樓幫均懷觀望、雖喊低至〇九元、然仍難獲對手、致未做開、晚收價仍作二千一百十一元、較之隔昨晚收軋漲二元、全天十七元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千一百十五元、收進二千一百元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>首飾金大而復回</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、初未更動、迨至九時四十二分、因烚赤晨開頗堅、故掛大一元、不久逾十分後、因烚赤潛勢向下、故立即回跌一元、此後未見變動、結果無榮辱、大同行仍懸原價二百十四元、新同行為二百十二元、收進二百〇六元、</p>
<p>純金突縮半辦士</p>
<p>三日倫敦電、英純金每盎司突縮半辦士、計退達七鎊八先令五辦士半、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦降低到至一千二百十一元九角、掛牌海關金仍平、計二元三角九分六厘、上海標準標金價亦隨跌四角、計一千二百〇七元二角、</p>
<h3>外匯期貨　賣風轉濃　匯價回鬆套利乏味</h3>
<p>匯市昨雖華商紗花幫　各大洋行等競相猛扒現期貨英美兩金、兼英行有利（代天津幫）亦跟蹤扒結現貨先令、但因英美等各外商銀行對於現貨仍照維持價供塞、尤以期貨賣意更濃、並因港電一度突來拋塞現貨英金、是以頭寸頗感寬裕、致市勢遂告現平而期帶鬆、因之掉期逐漸軋攏、照目前按月差價英金祇〇三一二五、美匯僅〇六二五、現貨掉月、則英金距離一八七五弱、美匯約三一二五許、合計按月利息（除傭）僅有三厘七毫左右、是以一般富商套利心思漸感乏味、交易暢旺、至港匯初因銀行場賣意頗濃、故為狀一度稍硬、後以洋行趁賤、一再力扒、致復回平、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠期均回縮〇六二五、紐約銀價依然呆走、倫敦生金降半便士、匯兌英對美小一厘三、對滬跌〇三一二五、對法勿動、美對英跌〇六二五、對滬未更、對法縮〇六二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英匯八便士二五、美匯十六元〇六二五、較之前收均無榮辱、開後華商紗花幫與各大洋行等、雖競相猛扒現貨英美兩金、但以英美等各銀行尚肯供塞、故鮮變幻、華商紗花幫與洋行相繼結進匯豐麥加利現貨英金八便士二五、兼又購結華比某行現貨美匯十六元〇六二五、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉跌半分、計徵百分之六·二五、此後雖外行有利代天津幫力吸現貨英金、無如港電適來吐售、致為狀仍鮮變化、港電賣予有利現貨英金八便士二五、後華商紗花幫與洋行又來力扒期貨美匯、無如外行對於期貨買意較濃、外行華比某行頻塞予紗花幫及洋行八月份美匯由十五元六二五、鬆至六八七五、繼之外行荷蘭亦買予洋行八月份英金八便士〇六二五、是以過程稍帶鬆硬、近午東方安達亦售予洋行錢兌業現貨港匯五十五元六二五及七五、為狀徵鬆、迨午收銀行現貨賣價、英美兩匯、與晨開無異、港匯五十五元七五、</p>
<p>後市雖洋行仍稍來扒結現貨英美兩金、但因外行供意尚佳、故潛勢終難起變化、計洋行結時外行華比荷蘭某行現貨美匯十六元〇六二五、繼之又購結英行匯豐現貨英金八便士二五、入後洋行又扒吸外行安達荷蘭現貨港匯五十五元六二五、為狀回平、迨晚收銀行現貨賣價英匯八便士七二五、美匯十六元〇六二五、港匯五十五元六二五、結果較之隔昨晚收英美港三匯、均無榮辱、</p>
<h3>外幣鬆動</h3>
<p>昨日英純金跌半辦士、英美匯兌降零六二五、本埠外匯洋行結款甚殷、紗花幫需要頗暢、幸銀行供給暢達、市價穩定如前、遠期亦趨鬆動、烚赤開盤金號銀樓業吸收甚旺、入後錢兌業客戶等、獲利供塞、下午供求頗稀、人心動蕩未定、結果微漲、外幣英美金鎊、殷富吸納頗盛、英美金票、交易甚旺、供給較充、且匯票遠期同鬆、市價趨鬆、法郎票澳金票需要較稀、市價略降、公會交易未做開、昨日市價、英金票降四分、美金票降半分、法郎票降二毫半、澳金票降一角、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>
<h3>津港申匯升降不一</h3>

<p>美匯　二十八元八一二五</p>
<p>申匯　一七九元</p>
<p>（申匯為港匯百元合上海法幣之數）</p>
<h3>『偽鈔』稍回</h3>
<p>天津　四日電、偽『聯銀劵』暗盤行市、上午開盤與三日上午開盤比較、計貴四元五角、法幣百元、可買『聯銀劵』一百三十元、即『聯銀劵』一元、祇值法幣七角六分九二三、</p>
<h3>貼現回跌一元</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、突然反動下落、每千元上午初仍盤於五十一元半間、俄即步低至五十一元、午刻復升至五十一元二角半、下午更形不支、一度步退至五十元〇二角半、最後五十元〇五角、比前日竟回跌一元云、</p>
<h3>中央銀行今日休假</h3>
<p>上海銀行業聯合準備委員會、昨日通函各行、為準中央銀行函開『五月五日為革命政府成立紀念』、循例於是日休假一天、所有關於該行及中央信托局五日應收應付票據、均改於翌日（六日）處理、至於其他銀行與錢莊、均照常營業云、</p>
<h3>證券　內債擯持不下</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、依然盤旋不定、買賣均極閒散、惟多方則密切注視市價之偶或墜落、如德字同順及四十一號等賣出稍多、價微疲一二角、多方即來拉抬、必使其恢復原狀而後已、午後形勢毫無變更、十號四十一號及順泰賣出、大來聯和及三十五號買進、市價微高五分、全日市價、結果略好五分一角而已、成交總數約五十萬元、今日孫緾理就任非常大總統紀念停市、慈列明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華商證券股五十股、價為二十九元八角五分、</p>
<p>上海眾業公所股市交易未見眾多、但市氣可稱良好、懇殖股驟漲至八元、收盤時此價有賣戶、及買價為七元九角、瑞镕普通股價七元四角、需求甚殷、怡和股隨紗價下落而略疲、收盤買價十八元七角、賣價十八元八角、橡皮股似有轉機、但成交微少、因買價與賣價相差太遠、</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠東各公司股票本月三日（星期三）掛牌行市、稍見漲起、匯豐銀行英倫注冊股上升半鎊、價為八十四鎊半、古拉客林傍橡皮股上升七便士半、價為十七先令六便士、餘者無變動、</p>
<p>倫敦中國外債本月三日（星期三）掛牌行市、僅善後借款矣發債票上升半鎊、價為五十一鎊半、其餘均告未定、</p>
<h3>紗花　大戶重來出籠　棉紗跌風復熾　實銷祇及十分之二</h3>
<p>紗市變幻莫測、跌風復熾、實則昔日一般狂拖濫進之戶、鑒於客銷不暢、心意不定、同時其中在高峯出籠之大戶頭、重來賣出、據市場言、故意壓小仍有做多之念、於是市場籌碼益感鬆懈、一時趨勢異常紊亂、市價之波浪浩大、使人膽寒、然業外者進出依然頻繁、且成交之旺盛亦屬不少、所以造成狂升狂降之局面也、就以上情況測之、前途仍在怒濤駭浪中、查其原因、謂昔日之漲太暴、今日之跌亦太迅速也、午後虛風復熾、二十支雙馬外棧現貨價猛降至四百二十元、價格低落後、引起某某等收意復勁、謂比星期一頂峯價要差三十元、且在檯面上努力購進、由此一來、聲勢重振、須臾間跳起六元、又做至四百二十六元、但收盤後仍平、棧單價為四百二十四元、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、市象略漲、然香港幫稍有納胃、開價不動、二十支雙馬現貨價為四百三十三元、少頃跌二元、旋以賣風驟旺、喊聲震耳、市價逐步下瀉、跌至四百二十五元、棧單價為四百十五元、旋以某某覺得大便宜、復來收進、又見回上二三元、午後開盤稍疲、賣勢益熾、跌風又起、一霎間二十支雙馬外棧現紗跌至四百二十元、棧單價為四百十三元、後以囤戶貪其廉宜、突來拖進、再起回風、復達四百二十六元、棧單價為四百十七元、據云收盤後愿意賣出者甚多、未能成交、查全日各幫買去統計二千四百五十五包、行情二十支雙馬天女比上日跌七八元、其他亦跌三五元不等、市場成交皮球交易占百分之八十、今日有棉紗五百六十五件運汕頭、一百十件運香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量如左、</p>
<p>同行一、九五〇　香港　二二〇　內地　二八五　統計二、四五五</p>
<p>日紗市面依然混亂不堪、不過市場交易大減、因上落太鉅、都有戒懼之心、惟市價又跌、二十支月琴退出始做三百八十三元、午後做到三百七十五元云、</p>
<h3>海外報漲　印棉交易日見繁榮</h3>
<p>本棉形同停頓</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約呈挺秀之狀、開盤即漲七磅音、股票好轉及棉區天氣太早、乃上漲之主因、同業亦有購進、結果較漲二至七磅音、印度昨日停市、惟暗盤漲風甚熾、白洛區四五月份已漲至一五九高價、埃及亦漲十餘磅音、匯兌遠期仍緊、折合法幣、棉價俱漲、計美棉及巴西棉每擔漲六角、印棉漲五角、埃及棉漲六角餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易轉呈活躍、廠需納胃漸健、蓋因美棉存底稀薄、貸款棉又尚無放出確息、新花登場尚需四月餘、我游擊區內之產棉、運滬銷售一節、殊屬不易、故日來各廠時有訂購大批外棉、尤以印棉為最、昨華廠方面計訂印棉八千包、英日廠為五千包、如印度棉市若能降少二三羅比、各廠均將大量訂購也、茲將昨日棉市折合送廠價錄下、</p>
<p>本棉生意形同停頓、實則貨物既缺而售價又昂、故各廠紛紛購訂印美棉補充應用、本棉交易驟減、獨市價勿跌、稍帶疲象、棉市情形絕少精彩、蘇北來源亦實落不旺、通州花到二百八十七包、又啟東來花四〇八件、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<h3>最近飛花業之動態</h3>
<p>楊樹浦日商上海紡續廠飛花、本於每月一日開票招買、無論任何國籍人民、均可投標承買、但自本月份起、已決定取銷開標、該廠所有飛花概歸上海日商飛花業員隨時購買、華商和洋商均無權參加、其他各日商紗廠尚在進行中、此事並非如外間謠傳歸日本軍部統制、甩全由在滬日商飛花業員操縱稱霸所致、</p>
<p>近來日本國內人造棉業頗為發達、從前該業大都采用木漿傳為製造原料、現已一律改用飛花和舊絮、且向上海日商訂辦大批該項原料、是亦促成上海日商飛花業統制之要素也、</p>
<p>戰事後上海小型紗廠之設立、如雨後春筍、而所用原料、完全采用中上級飛花、以紡粗紗、因之當地飛花價格、較高於外銷出口價格、滬上各飛花出口業洋行、因亦無交易可做、所可做者、祇剩少量中級貨和下級貨而已、</p>
<p>其他如華商申新永安及外商崇新廠等、雖非在日商操縱范圍之內、然大關毀於砲火、所可開車者、不及戰前百份之二十五、其所出飛花、當極希少、一方則求過於供、以致雙方背道而馳、造成目前破天荒最高紀錄之新價格也、</p>
<p>旣然付最高之代價、而猶未能和往時相同身份之貨品、蓋自國棉上漲後、滬上各紗廠因價格關係、大都　用低級印度棉、印度棉織維和成色、均不及國棉、尤其所也飛花、更相差遠矣、</p>
<p>日商已操縱商場後、然亦難能全部獨吞、蓋一小部份飛花、仍須轉售於華商如漿下地腳等下級貨、此種下級貨、價格甚低、倘欲運至日本、則其打包水腳等手續費、反超過其貨品原價之上、故此非彼羣所樂為、按上項種種觀察、對於滬上各飛花出口業洋行前途非常慘淡、未來之交易途徑、祇有少量之中級貨和下級貨而已、（琪）</p>
<h3>疋頭　散戶希圖　廉價脫售　高低相差五角　東疋迭見低盤</h3>
<p>國布　最近布價掀起空前漲風後、以實銷仍少發展、惟以多戶有利形勢、一時尚乏變化、各廠家多數趕織定貨、且織造成木、不論原紗物料開繳、均一致步增、故開價比諸市上熟貨、均須提高、是以業內外殷富　住不鬆、尚有繼續購囤、粗布·細斜·色布·漂布·綫呢行裝貨三百餘件、散戶手貨以轉瞬間已獲重利、每疋頗多按市廉價數角、以圖脫兔手、市盤高低價相差、最多每疋竟達五角之巨、本街批發號賣予無錫·南京·泰州·興化·蚌埠等內地幫白貨粗布·細布·色布·色斜·府綢·漂布·麻紗·花布綜計五六千疋、染廠辦粗細坯面餐丁斜紋　三千餘疋、天津幫續裝大批府綢條漂卡其布、粵幫辦細布百餘件、色布·色斜·府綢六七十箱、川滇幫以海防航綫月內將增希臘商直航綸兩艘、裝貨稍獲寬展、各貨進員略增、辦廠布色布條漂等貨一百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　細布·細斜昨以客銷呆滯、本街同業乘機拋空、市場迭見低盤、細布每疋跌二角外、細斜現貨跌一角、期貨跌三角半、十二磅龍頭細布上現盤每疋為十四元五角、除皮球交易外、實銷殊淡、本街染業幫進辦各牌現期貨約八九百件、但洋行未有開貨、業外囤戶、仍有逢廉拖進、市面呈盤旋之象、</p>
<p>出口　疋頭五日出口、一百五十件運汕頭、二十件運香港、</p>
<h3>糧食　米限價　名存實亡</h3>
<p>國米、昨日河下未到、而車輪包子來蘇同幫一千四五百包、無錫七百五十包、崑山五百包、大局市面、自隔昨突然奔騰後、人心殊屬激昂、暗盤高價疊出、特頂粳已開至十五元三角、但衡之實際、全滬存米只減少三萬包、此種情由、實為某方百端壟斷中國民食、偽吏奸商又從中作崇、南來之米、扣留於米市渡者只見其多、未見放行、據云無錫方面、每日祇準出運五車（每車一百五十包）確否待證、松江之米、某國洋行、仍在搬運、蘇同一帶、日偽商以大利所在、亦思染指、不但米糧如此、即連日豬肉亦為扣留之故、大漲特漲、此後欲解除生活上之苦痛、除望勝利之外、別無他途、惟前日以限盤將作『正式』之開放、故拖進者頗多、其後寗愿暗中放大、名義上仍守限價、重行退貨者亦不少、故昨市開做、人心即平、本街及囤戶僅互相授受而已、故結果厚薄粳悉呈定局、杜洋尖·埠尖·及變元、價亦乏榮辱耳、</p>
<p>客秈　邇日到頭火車與江輪絡繹不絕、昨日新到京蕪各秈仍有六千包左右、蓋自滬價步漲後、已引起行販之搬運、故囤戶突然停辦、本街零化總討不到三千包、京蕪各秈售價隨被削落一角云、</p>
<h3>麺粉又漲一角</h3>
<p>二號已到四元五角半　天津粉價傳可售五元</p>
<p>麺粉昨現粉廠盤、又起漲風、自粉價步漲以來、客銷雖一度轉懈、昨需要又活、據北洋幫消息、天津粉價可售五元、是以販運利益頗佳、日有一部份客囤天津、皆由於物價看高叫致、南洋幫零銷亦不寂寞、廠方鑒於客銷活動之下、深恐國外原料再漲、及存粉枯竭、生產稀少之際、趁此一再喊價、以示限制大量供給、開昨日上午二號粉廠盤先漲五分、祇供本街零批交易、午後再漲五分、已達四元五角五分現鈔、結果　本街交易外、南北兩幫及其他散戶、成交綜計五六萬包、據市場談論、此次米價之狂漲、與粉市前途、不無連帶關係、故人心尚在看好中、</p>
<p>洋粉亦見挺秀、查國外產價頻漲、遠期定價、已到四元八角美金、聞某洋行今日、又有花旗粉十餘萬包可到、市面腳地頗穩、聞洋粉市價、漸與廠粉相等、大致亦為四元五角半及四元五角之現鈔、但無相當成交、</p>
<p>出口今日有一萬二千包運天津、八千包運汕頭、</p>
<h3>麥價看好難　洋麥陸續到</h3>
<p>昨本麥來源仍少、自粉價步漲後、執貨者莫不堅持、以待善價而沽、惟目下麥市環境、已非粉市可比、今日又有澳洲、麥七千餘噸抵滬、且洋行方面，迭有期洋麥兜售、聞花旗散艙、合價僅六元六七角、較之本麥為廉、惟船期則須兩月、本麥前途、頗受影響、目下各廠均有洋麥應用、對於本麥需要、暫時恐難開展、正式市面、或將待諸新麥登場矣、</p>
<p>又立　洋行經辦之澳麥七千七百十三噸、計九萬二千零十一包、係裝怡和洋行、經理之King　William號輪運滬、原定昨日抵埠、已志昨報、今悉該輪行駛遲緩、須今晨方可進口、改泊於九號十號浮簡起卸</p>
<h3>雜糧　連豆不支</h3>
<p>行情轉跌角外</p>
<p>近日大連豆市氣、本恃統制問題、壟斷支持、故在六七天內、尚能擯持原價、但銷場未能興奮、以致轉跌角外、計開現連豆五車、價為九元零七分至零二分、二星期交一車、行情亦開九元零二分、其他各豆、在事實上祇為點綴而已、故在供求相敵之下、市態頗形穩定、計成交崇明沙黃豆百餘包、價為九元零五分至八元八角、南京豆一百十包、價為八元六角五分、蕪湖豆一百包、價為九元二角送到、五日有豆子二百五十包運汕、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲銷仍盛</h3>
<p>紐約絲市高昂不已　將使綢廠購代用品</p>
<p>國外絲市、漲風仍熾、橫濱現貨漲十五元、遠期漲八元、紐約標準絲近期漲二分、遠期流線型分、八三分七五分日絲各漲五分、上海絲則仍無開出、觀乎日美絲價、高漲羽翼已達頂點、生絲消費最巨之美國、縱使軋現之象、仍未稍減、但此等絲價、亦必與綢價不能配合也、況美國在不久將來、即將出現更進一步之人造絲、名曰Nylon者、（按此種織維較現行之人造絲不管天壤之別、可謂與真絲完全相像）、然則生絲軋現、必將引起綢廠轉購代用品、而更速　成最善代用品之出現、</p>
<p>本埠絲市、白廠七八分、洋行進胃甚殷、行盤漲二十元、惜成交僅一百數十包、法莊昨亦隨之吸購、白廠B字RR價一七五〇——一七六五元、做開六十擔、為仁昌等行購進、美莊絲以達昌·怡和·仁記·比較活躍、輯里經美銷、昨僅有發電、印度洋行則進十擔、價開原盤、</p>
<h3>油餅　生豆油囤戶　獲利回出</h3>
<p>昨日生豆油市況、承上日潛勢、似可挺進、但一般浮囤獲利了結、更以來源暫不虞斷絕、以致籌碼頓感充盈、大戶囤胃亦淡、行情跌一元、成交膠州生油一百五十件、價為三十七元、路貨亦開三十七元、成交一百四十件、大連豆油做開一百五十桶、價為四十五元五角半、豐年油五十桶、四十五元、白絞油十桶、四十元零五分、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷糖漲風仍厲</h3>
<p>昨荷糖產地遠期九十十一月份照C．I．F．例為荷盾九·二〇、升〇·三五、七八月份照C．I．F．例為六·二八、九月份五·六二五、太古糖仍在停售中、故市勢依然上展、公會劃盤、二四粗白本棧貨又漲近元、初為二十九元八角、後略回鬆至六角、外棧貨六角至四角、轉口貨初劃二十一元三角、旋升廿一元半、最後回至三角半至二角半、共成交二千餘包、荷赤升七角、現貨為十九元二角、轉口十三元七角、成交一二百包、本廠白升半元、振記一號二十九元、本廠冰升元半、一號冰三十四元半、晶明冰三十六元、太古車白漲四角、B嘜西棧二十八元八角、國糖海南赤升四角、以十三元二角成交三百包、正綿赤升四五角、上牌十七元三角、次之十七元至十六元八九角、開出一百六十餘包、降青六十餘包、十三元半、</p>
<h3>海味　西洋淡菜　新陳均有需要</h3>
<p>西洋淡菜、自見新以來、出數奇少、新近到過小淡一批、業已售開、其價為七十五元、比前升五元、查此間大中色陳貨、亦將銷通、</p>
<h3>五金　東白鐵漲起角許</h3>
<p>東白鐵日前大阪裝來現貨不少、致本埠售盤趨跌、且本埠日商廠家亦有大量現貨塞出、因此市象一厥不振、客戶買主均鑒市貨充斥、最近大阪出貨因受日政府之統制、不克隨裝來、致本埠日商廠家心思高昂、售盤亦陸續提加、最近如三七尺每張售二元七角五分、三六尺二元一角六分、均比前市好起一角一二分有奇、　　客銷方面、最近亦不十分活潑、市場之惟一依賴者、祇本街建筑幫而已、其他去路殊少、全市殊無新奇發展也、</p>

<h3>婦女血崩經亂　宜常食阿膠糯米粥</h3>
<p>— 謝也農</p>
<p>婦女月經，每月一次，經水緩緩而下，旺盛時的三五日，以後又漸漸由少而凈，此爲正常情形。若日期超前落後，及行時過多過少，均爲病徵。崩與漏二者卽屬月經病之一種，經行時有血塊血團夾雜共中，日久不止者，卽血崩之先兆，亟應注意預防，宜安心靜臥，不可行劇烈動作，動則血管破裂之處不能凝結，血出不易停止。及至轉成崩症，血水大最下冲，猶如潰堤決口，此際身體驟失榮養，而色頓呈慘淡，皮膚口脣指端亦芥白若死，神衰力弱，心悸跳躍，手足發麻，知覺呆鈍，甚或暴脫暈厥。欲圖急救，惟有用吉林人參煎湯灌飲。血止後再視症狀，服常歸，白芍，黃茋，白朮，炙草，黨參，等藥物調治。</p>
<p>漏紅乃慢性出血，月經點點滴滴，淋瀝不斷，兼見腰酸，力乏，頭眩，食少，諸象。症情不如血崩之嚴重，危險性亦少。惟未崩之先，每因漏久而起，換言之，久漏卽有成崩可能，是以一見漏紅，卽宜速治。按崩漏之病因，或爲跌仆震動，房事受損，或爲情感過烈，勃然鬱怒，神經受重大刺戟。其主因乃氣虛不能攝血，病發則血液大虧。治療之法，除以人參湯救急外，在病勢减退後與漏紅之過程中，則以補血北血爲第一要義。然血液不易驟生，培養須收日漸月將之效。茲介紹一簡單易行之粥食療法：用糯米三合煮粥，將熟時加淸阿膠二兩，煮化和勻，令病者食，阿膠爲女科中補血上品，糯米能益氣補脾，合用能補虛止血，厚益腸胃。故此方看來似覺平淡無奇，久食極著功效也。</p>
<h3>産後食物宜忌</h3>
<p>— 張汝偉</p>
<p>婦人產後，百脈空虛，惡血已去，新血漸生，此時飲食，最宜注意。但各處風俗不同，譬如江市一帶，（指蘇松常太附近言，）婦女產後最初半個月中，多進米煮稀粥，下半月始進軟飯，普通之菜，以菜乾爲最佳。（即冬令之小上菜，）食之，最能養胃滋液。或用胡桃肉去衣，油汆後，用椒鹽，白糖，各半拌食之。或以火腿煮爛，食其湯及精肉。一切葷油膩厚之品，均忌。但寗波人於產後，則並不食粥，專食赤糖糊麪。浙江之桐廬富陽，安徽之黟縣等處，產後食雞子，或雞肉蹄膀等，然忌食生冷酸辣之物，則各地皆然，方書有產後宜食羊肉一法，余謂此宜於滿月之後，若產婦素不能食羊肉者，可以豆腐衣代之。皆有裨產後體力之道也。</p>
<h3>婦女多產　食鴨最宜</h3>
<p>— 許錦濤</p>
<p>婦人懷孕，胎兒日食母血以養，如婦人多產，必致氣血大虧，若無適當調養，柔弱之軀，多有成爲產癆症者。其病象如腰酸骨楚，叫肢乏力，精神頹唐，目眩頭暈，眼花耳嗚，記憶力减退等，此蓋失血過多，而體質日漸虧損之故也。人體血液雖能藉藥力以補充，但禀賦各有不同，虧損亦有重輕，藥物固不少確有補效者，但藥性難免龐雜，輕重恐不合拍。，不如以富於滋養而合於胃口之品佐食，較爲妥善。鴨性甘凉，滋五藏之陰，淸虛勞之熱，補血行水，養胃生津。故養生家有言：「爛蒸老雄鴨，功效比參箐」。鴨之功效，可以想見。用以調養婦人多產或成產癆者，實爲補身滋陰之無上妙品。（仿效粵人菜希中加入藥品之法，可於煮鴨時加當歸四錢，懷山藥四錢，玉竹四錢及紅棗三四枚，補血養生之力，更爲卓著，初食時味或不甚適口，三四决後藥味亦尙可口，存仁附識）。</p>
<h3>當月經來時</h3>
<p>— 琳</p>
<p>每一個發育完全的女子，在每一個月裹都有一决流血的麻煩，這就是月經。健康的女子，大概都是二十八日行經一决的，但也有例外的：或隔三十多日一决，或不到二十八日一决，只要每次相隔的日數相同，那就不必注意了；女子的月經病，大多是由於行經期不注重攝生所致，允其在發育的初期，行動過勞飲食生冷，不加審愼，往往會鑄成終生的痛苦，而影響到身體的健康。</p>
<p>女子在行經時，十九都感到疲倦，和因卵子破裂而出血的子宮痛。這時應禁止一切劇烈的運動，多休息，勿食生冷和刺激性的食物，勿過飽，多食流動性和營養豐富的食物，如牛奶鷄蛋蔬菜等，每天用艾葉一錢和黃酒煎服，能溫煖子宮，調經；或每日以益母膏五錢，紅糖少許黃酒冲服，也有活血調經的功效如　　　次　期裏能吃一隻母雞，營養力史大，法用母雞一隻洗凈，和當歸三五錢，黃酒少許，隔水蒸爛而食。因常蹄爲補血淸血要藥，能治一切血虛血濁，破惡血，生新血，補女子諸種不足，而爲調經補血之良藥，和雞同食，補力返大，非一般補品所可比擬。</p>
<h3>食品催乳</h3>
<p>— 缶鳴</p>
<p>養育嬰孩的最大問題，莫過於哺乳。一個嬰孩，在母親肚子裏中的時候，是有母親直接以血來培養它的，等到分娩之後，母體便天然地起了生理變化，將養胎所需要的的血液，移到神秘的乳房中來，依舊供給這嬰孩，可是色調却已從紅的變成白的了；待嬰孩漸長，則乳質漸濃，以後嬰孩發育漸增，則乳質也日新月異的變化，所以母親的乳汁，實在是最適合於嬰孩的食品。</p>
<p>假使一個健全的母親，天天用自己的乳汁去喂她的嬰孩，不幸有一天她的產量突然减少，使嬰孩不能吃飽，而啼哭，那末做父母的煩悶自然不言可知，必定要想出種種可以代替母乳的東西來補救，但是，有的爲了經濟問題，稍一不愼，嬰孩的嬌嫩的脾胃，便易發生疾病，而日趨衰弱，甚至死亡。</p>
<p>母親的乳汁，何以會突然减少呢？其中多數由於疾病或營養欠佳，當然別的原因也有，現在特地介紹食養法兩種如下：</p>
<p>（一）猪蹄一對，去凈毛垢；加木通三錢，同煮濃汁，愈濃愈好，稍稍加鹽，而味以淡爲上，取猪蹄和汁佐膳食之，雖木通味苦，如去木通不用，則其功稍差。</p>
<p>（二）以烏背鯽魚一尾，洗凈，加香葱數根，生猪油數塊，更可加其他調味品，共煮汁飲之，其效甚大，乳汁缺乏的母親，何妨一試。</p>
<h3>生食熟食</h3>
<p>— 徐林炎</p>
<p>人之生理，固宜熟食，然完全熟食而不略參以生食之品，亦非健康之道。考熟食之益，爲（一）適於人之生理，（二）消毒，（三）調味，（四）易消化；生食之益，爲（一）助消化，（二）盡景攝取共內含之營養素，（三）調劑口味，（四）促進體工新陳代謝。故熟食與生食，二者允宜並重。</p>
<p>生食之品，最適於人體者，當推水菓。</p>
<p>不論何種水菜，所含生活素皆極豐富，勞力後及飯後略食之，均極有益。惟目下水菓價格昂貴，已非一般人所能負擔，價廉物品者惟番茄耳。</p>
<p>番茄色紅，味略酸，隨處均產，滬郊各鄉，允盛植此物，西人幾乎每餐必備。所含各種生活素皆極豐富，食時宜先將其外皮洗凈，再用沸水泡過，然後剝去其皮。稍加食鹽或白糖食之，味極鮮美。常服能補血通便生津助消化長膂力，效難盡述；如與肉類等同煮，亦有異味。</p>
<h3>頓咳</h3>
<p>— 張贊臣</p>
<p>頓咳之症，初由外感風邪而起，始則微有寒熱，鼻塞聲重，微嗆痰粘；此時一般人每因其症之尋常，而不加注意，經過一二星期後，則邪遏於肺而不宣。氣管黏膜因之發生變態，呼吸遂益短促，而成氣逆之狀。咳則頓陣連續，甚至泛嘔；稍歇片時，咳又復作，一日間發三四决至數十决不等。其咯出之痰，爲透明之黏液，如治療失當，往往能綿延至二三月之久，故俗有百日咳之稱。此病之易患者，皆爲一至六歲之小兒，春冬寒溫失調之時，患者允多。冶療之法，每日可用杏仁，胡桃仁，各等分，去皮，搗如泥，生薑少許，煎湯冲服。按杏仁功能宜肺潤燥，鎭咳祛痰，爲洽咳之要藥；胡桃雖爲普通食品，但因其內含脂肪油，故營養力極富，能療咳痰嗽；生薑則能散寒，止嘔，豁痰，及减少分泌。合而用之，確爲治頓咳之妙方。惟尙須注意病者之平日營養及室溫，以資輔助。</p>

<h3>黃豆的營養價值</h3>
<p>— 金振聲</p>
<p>在農產物中，滋養料最富豐的，要算是黃豆了，便是它的製成品也很多，像豆乳，豆腐，豆腐乾，醬油，黃豆芽等，都含有很豐富的滋養料。據李時珍說：「黃豆多食令人身重」。這「令人身重」四個字，大可玩味，意思就是說黃豆富於蛋白質和脂肪，久服能使人肥健，增加體重。</p>
<p>據科學家說：黃豆具有較馬鈴薯大上五倍的熱力，甘倍的蛋白質，和二百倍的脂肪質；所以黃豆的營養價値比任何食物來得大。黃豆製成的豆乳，稱爲人造牛乳，營養價値之大，不亞於牛乳；又且代價非常低廉，大衆都可服用。</p>
<p>現在用黃豆製成的黃豆芽，在南洋羣島已大得英政府的獎許。原來南洋有一位姓胡的小資本商人，創辦了專製黃豆芽的塲所，發售給僑胞食用，因爲照例須得英政治的化騐，不料化騐結粱，認爲這種食品，非但淸潔衛生，並且營養料甚爲富足，所以大得英政府的獎許，引起異國人民的注意，而胡氏營此小本營業，竟利市三倍。</p>
<p>此外，用黃豆製成的食物還　啦，大抵取其精華，棄其糟粕而成，含滋養料的豐富，可不言而知，豆腐的功效和故事，更不必講了。</p>
<h3>傷風咳嗽</h3>
<p>— 鄒德民</p>
<p>傷風咳嗽，乃風邪入肺，肺起抗邪作用所致。春令人之肌腠開泄，風邪最易侵襲，患者允多。症狀爲咳嗽，頭脹，鼻塞，淸涕；重者發熱，此乃肺受風邪，氣失淸肅之故，治以輕宜之劑，邪去咳自止。前胡桔梗杏仁蘇子，不難一藥而愈。然飲食必須謹愼，故忌口亦爲一重大問題。素食及淸淡之味，最爲相宜，酸辣魚腥能刺激肺臟，易使咳嗽增劇：膏肥厚味，則滋膩而生痰。時人畏服藥，藥縱對症，而以傷風爲小恙，並不介意，且有貪食口腹，致邪歛於肺，化燥爍陰，咳而不爽，口乾聲瘖，馴至絡傷咯血，鑄成大錯者。如爲小兒，更易釀成肺炎重症。大凡不愼於先，必貽患於後也。</p>
<h3>痧子旣回　仍應注意風寒與飲食</h3>
<p>— 朱作三</p>
<p>痧子一症，往往經過順利，反於回後別起變證者，此皆調養不愼之故也。</p>
<p>痧子原屬時邪，透發爲先，故至痧子盡透而回，邪已宣泄，身熱自退，間或稍遺痧毒，亦能自行分解，不是爲患；但每因保護者注意稍疏，對於病兒風寒與飲食，以爲可以放任，遂至遺患突起，因痧子發於肺經，又經熱爍，肺之淸肅失令，咳嗽未已，偶感風寒，重者身熱復起。咳嗽不宣，肺氣旣鬱，痰濁壅盛，仍轉而爲支氣管炎或肺炎者有之；感之輕者，或熱或不熱，咳嗽則必增而難解，或遷延不已，肺熱內蘊，耗灼陰液，釀成痧後癆者有之。又因痧子初時，腸胃亦曾發炎，內部未靖，若飲食不愼，濫進油膩及不易消化之物，亦必發熱，停積泄瀉，甚則至變；月是時胃中虛火所炎，食慾暴盛，內積久而不解，每多生蟲化疳。更若寒食兩感，亦有輕重緩急之二途，輕者身熱陡起，再透痧疹（俗稱雲頭疹）尙易解散，重者內積生驚或外而肺炎併發，其緩者積漸以成，放爲疳癆，大爲棘手。故於痧子回後，猶有必須注意之點，有如下述：</p>
<p>回後一週內，仍宜安臥，窗戶雖應敞開，以通空氣，而直接之風，還當愼避，衣被亦不宜輕减；飲食方面，腥膩刺激，鮮發之品，咸宜禁忌，日常仍食稀粥或焦飯粥，佐餐以醬菜（醬瓜，醬蘿萄）及大頭菜，陳海蜇，乾菜筍，嫩豆腐等爲宜。點心則鹹蘇打餅乾及白蓮藕粉，水菓中生梨，荸薺，紅皮甘蔗，橘子等物，均可酌予，但若大便不實，則屏絕爲是，七日以後，精神漸復，可以起床，但還宜時時休息，玩耍勿使過度，已經入學者，書籍尙不宜閱讀，恐眼力疲勞，則將來目光受損；胃口旣旺，可稍予飯食，但宜酌其欲量减半，不使過飽，小菜禁忌，可逐漸擴大範圍，先以蔬菜如菠菜，豌豆等，繼則鷄蛋火腿等，亦可稍稍予之；至於發物，如鹹芥菜等，則數月內仍須禁食，吾則易生瘡疥。</p>

<h3>Silence in Northern Guangdong, Standoff on the West River; Main Force of the Japanese Army Concentrated in Guangzhou; Japanese Troops in Xinhui and Heshan Withdraw to Jiangmen in Succession; A Portion of the Japanese Army in Jiujiang Has a Tendency to Invade Gaoming; Japanese Blockade Humen to Prevent Attacks by Chinese Guerrillas</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Japanese troops in Xinhui and Heshan, Guangdong, continue to withdraw to Jiangmen. The number of Japanese warships on the Jiujiang River has also decreased. The main force of the Japanese army seems to be concentrating in Guangzhou. Northern Guangdong is silent, Nanlu and Lingdong are safe, and the West River is in a standoff.

<p>Qingyuan: A reporter crossed the river to Conghua to inspect the war zone. For forty to fifty li, most of the houses were destroyed by Japanese bombs, and the markets were all in ruins. The people, deeply wounded, all share a common hatred. The Pa River District militia now has enough young men armed with new-style firearms, vowing to resist Japan to the death. The relationship between the army and the people is harmonious. The people help the army resist the war, and the army helps the people with spring plowing. In November of last year, the Japanese invaded Qingyuan and were surrounded by the militia. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, the Japanese suffered hundreds of casualties and fled in panic. On April 6th, the Japanese invaded Conghua and Qingyuan again. The Chinese side only used one-quarter of its regular army in cooperation with the militia, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese, killing over a hundred. Platoon Leader Wu Deshen led 48 men on a mission to defend a certain stronghold under Conghua. They encountered nearly a thousand Japanese cavalry invading. Platoon Leader Wu used clever tactics to command the militia, resisting for several hours, and finally, reinforcements arrived, allowing the entire line to turn from danger to safety. This is a glimpse of the heroic resistance of the Chinese army and people. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Street Fighting Breaks Out in Yixing City</h3>

<h3>Spiritual Mobilization Implemented in Xichang</h3>
<p>Xichang: Transportation in Xichang is inconvenient, and various anti-Japanese war movements are relatively lagging. However, since the establishment of the Executive Headquarters, the morale of the people has suddenly become enthusiastic. The Xichang Mobilization Committee was established last month and, with regard to the outline and significance of the General Mobilization of National Spirit, the Director of the Executive Headquarters, Zhang Dulun, and important cadres went to various schools to give lectures.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Litvinov's Dismissal and England</h3>
<p>The international situation is turbulent, and all parties are intricate, not knowing where to go. Only the strength of England and the Soviet Union stands out as a crucial factor in influencing the overall situation. The ongoing negotiations between the two countries are the catalyst among these factors. Representing the Soviet Union and responsible for the negotiations was the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov. The success or failure of the negotiations, the joy or sorrow of the two powers, the totalitarian countries watch with sideways glances, and the democratic countries listen intently. However, news suddenly arrived that Litvinov had been dismissed. The Supreme Soviet approved it without hesitation. The vacancy was not filled by Deputy Commissar Potemkin but was concurrently held by the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Molotov. This sudden event shocked the world. The Soviet Union not only showed no signs beforehand but also made a decisive decision on the spot. Soviet politics indeed has a unique style and is a creation in world political history. It is said to be mysterious, but it is a manifestation of its revolutionary nature and the atmosphere of a new country!</p>
<p>Litvinov, over sixty years old, is a loyal follower of Bolshevism. He dedicated himself to the revolution during the Tsarist era. After the success of the revolution, he served as a member of the Central Executive Committee and engaged in foreign affairs. In 1925, when People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Chicherin retired, Litvinov succeeded him, holding the position until now, spanning fourteen years. The Soviet Union went from being isolated to becoming an important force on the world stage, from being the target of public criticism to becoming a country of hope. This was not achieved by one person or one event, but in terms of diplomacy, Litvinov played a leading role. It was not merely due to his position or opportunity, but his outstanding talent was truly unmatched. Summarizing his achievements: in addition to dedicating himself to the country, eliminating the jealousy of other countries, and gaining the recognition of other countries, he contributed greatly to the international community. Joining the League of Nations and changing its atmosphere, first; formulating the Kellogg-Briand Pact, second; advocating the collective security system, third; making a clear definition of aggressor states, fourth; advocating disarmament, fifth; concluding non-aggression pacts with many countries, sixth; and forming an alliance with France to stabilize the European situation, seventh. No contemporary diplomat can compare with Litvinov in terms of words and deeds. Now, his sudden dismissal must have its internal causes in the Soviet Union, but it is impossible not to deeply regret it internationally.</p>
<p>The reasons for Litvinov's dismissal have not been publicly stated by the Soviet authorities; claiming illness is not a convincing excuse. In November 1937, when Europe was dissatisfied with the Soviet Union, and as a result, some people were disgusted with Litvinov, it was rumored that Litvinov would be leaving his post due to suspicion in a party case. Later facts refuted the falsehood of this claim, and his current dismissal must also be unrelated to this. Then what is the reason for his sudden dismissal? Some point to this as a precursor to a change in Soviet foreign policy. Foreign policy is a part of a country's main national policy. All countries with a regular course will never easily change their foreign policy. To say that the Soviet Union will undergo drastic changes in today's turbulent international situation is unbelievable. Soviet national policy is more resolute than any other country because of its unique nation-building characteristics. Foreign policy is tied to the central core of the country and not to diplomats; therefore, its diplomatic achievements can be attributed to Litvinov's talent, but its diplomatic policies do not shift with Litvinov's changes. To say that Litvinov's dismissal is due to a change in policy is also unbelievable. Moreover, the Soviet Union's current diplomacy, in terms of its main objectives, seeks security and peace. In terms of policy, it opposes aggression as its backbone and considers totalitarian countries its strongest enemies. The alliance with France two years ago was based on this objective. Now that England has abandoned its conservative prejudices and condescends to approach the Soviet Union, it is a miracle of the international community and a success of the Soviet Union. It almost has the appearance of holding the ear of Europe. To say that it will abandon its previous achievements, change its policies, sever ties with England and France, and engage with Germany and Italy is even more unbelievable, indeed absolutely unbelievable.</p>
<p>Some point to this as a political storm in the Soviet Union's internal affairs, a factional struggle. These kinds of bureaucratic political theories and concepts are not applicable to the Soviet Union, so they are unbelievable. The so-called purification work within the Soviet Union has been repeatedly declared successful and stopped, so how can there be any aftereffects? Therefore, it is also unbelievable. Taking a step back, even if something happened, wouldn't there be a more appropriate time? Why sacrifice first-class diplomatic talent at a time when diplomatic negotiations are extremely difficult? This is also absolutely unbelievable.</p>
<p>From our perspective, Litvinov's dismissal is not related to the Soviet Union's fundamental policies, and the reason still lies in diplomacy. Soviet diplomacy mainly has three aspects: towards the Far East, towards Central and Eastern Europe, and towards France and England. Towards the Far East, it is important but not acute today; moreover, the core of its importance is not in so-called diplomacy; therefore, Litvinov was dismissed for diplomacy, but not for the Far East. Towards Central and Eastern Europe, it is not with Germany and Italy that diplomacy is the core. In addition, Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin is visiting internationally, his mission is not yet complete, and he is awaiting orders, so there is no merit or demerit to speak of; therefore, Litvinov was dismissed for diplomacy, but also not for Central and Eastern Europe. Towards France, there is an alliance to rely on, and the relationship between France and the Soviet Union can be said to be harmonious. The focus of the problem is not between England and the Soviet Union! Since England and the Soviet Union began negotiations, the world has said that the Soviet Union's collective security policy will match the organization of England's anti-aggression group in perfect harmony. Unexpectedly, after more than ten days, it has remained detached and has made no progress. The Soviet Union has never made any explanations or publicity about this; and the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary's answers to questions from members of Parliament are evasive, and they each have unspeakable secrets. The crux of the matter is not something that outsiders can understand; just as Litvinov's dismissal is incomprehensible to all parties. Two negatives make a positive, and they may not be able to enlighten each other! Looking at the various reports, the Soviet Union has a lot of unpleasant feelings towards British-style diplomacy, but it is only a trivial matter. However, the organization of the British anti-aggression group disregards the Far East; it demands that the Soviet Union bear a heavy responsibility on the western border, but Britain is stingy with promises of mutual assistance for the possible dangers that the Soviet Union may face in the Far East; this is probably what makes the Soviet Union feel greatly unhappy. Britain generously gave guarantees to Poland, Romania, and other countries in advance, and then asked the Soviet Union to follow suit. The objective result seems to be shifting part or all of the responsibility for guarantees to the Soviet Union; not only that, but Poland and other countries, after receiving British guarantees, on the one hand, have expectations of the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, still have fears of the Soviet Union; Britain has not only failed to guide the countries it guarantees well, making them treat the Soviet Union with sincerity, but also recognizes the existence of the gap between them and favors them; this is probably what makes the Soviet Union feel greatly unhappy. This kind of British-style cleverness can certainly be compromised by Litvinov, but it may not be tolerated by the Soviet Union's highest institution. Litvinov is a diplomat and has the breadth and style of a diplomat, but the Soviet Union's highest institution is a representative of a revolutionary new country. Therefore, although the two countries' foreign policies have different paths but the same destination, the Soviet Union's highest institution probably believes that Litvinov's method is not enough to prompt the clever England to reach the other shore as soon as possible. To spur it on and correct it, the only way is to take drastic measures, and thus Litvinov was dismissed!</p>
<p>All of these observations are what we believe to be practical, and we hope that future facts will corroborate them. As for the reasons for Litvinov's dismissal, no one in the world can understand it except for the Soviet central authority. Only the British Prime Minister Chamberlain must be able to understand it implicitly. Litvinov's dismissal has shocked the world, and Chamberlain and others must be the most shocked. This may be what England is unwilling to admit, but what the reporter wants to assert.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Japanese Planes Raided Chongqing Again Yesterday, Chinese Planes Engaged in Combat Over Beipei, British Commander Just Arrived in Shantou, Shantou Was Bombed Twice, Jieyang, Chaozhou, Yingde and Other Places Were Also Heavily Bombed</h3>
<p>(Chengdu) According to information from the Sichuan Provincial Air Defense Headquarters, 27 Japanese planes infiltrated Sichuan province via the Sichuan-Hubei border at 6 PM on the 4th, attempting to raid Chongqing via Beipei. Chinese Shenying (Divine Eagle) aircraft took off and engaged them in combat over Beipei. Some Japanese planes took advantage of the situation to infiltrate and drop bombs over Chongqing city, then quickly fled. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) When Japanese planes raided Chongqing at 5 PM on the 4th, the Central News Agency building took a direct hit and was destroyed. One or two employees were buried and are currently being excavated. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chongqing Air Defense Headquarters received a telegram from Yichang at 3:40 PM on the 4th stating that 36 Japanese planes were spotted flying west in the northern part of the county. At 5:05 PM, 27 Japanese planes were spotted flying north from the east in Xingshan county. At 5:21 PM, a loud plane noise was heard in Wuxi, flying north from the south.

After dropping the bombs, the Japanese planes fled along the river. The all-clear was sounded around 6 PM. The Air Defense Department is currently supervising the defense corps to do their best to rescue the affected areas. Details of casualties are still being investigated. Japanese planes have been bombing commercial and residential areas for days, and dropping many incendiary bombs, resulting in the destruction of many shops and civilian houses, and the tragic deaths of many civilians, women and children. This cruel behavior is unprecedented. The massacre of Chinese civilians has increased the sense of shared hatred and strengthened their determination to resist aggression. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Japanese planes again raided Chongqing this afternoon, with losses almost as severe as yesterday. Japanese planes hit an important wireless radio station in Chongqing, so news about Chongqing was virtually cut off from the outside world for several hours. It is understood that the Central News Agency and the International Wireless Radio Station were bombed. The wireless radio station immediately ceased broadcasting, and telephone service was also interrupted. It is determined that 29 Japanese planes participated in the air raid, which lasted from 5 PM to 6 PM. At that time, the city was completely darkened to prevent air raids, and the entire city became a world of darkness. The bombs dropped by the Japanese planes were explosive and incendiary, so several places in the city caught fire. Fortunately, firefighters fought fiercely to prevent the fire from spreading. According to earlier reports, the Central News Agency was bombed, but only a few coolies were injured. According to the Air Defense Headquarters, a total of 29 Japanese bombers attacked. After receiving the report of the Japanese planes' arrival, the Air Defense Headquarters immediately dispatched fighter planes to intercept them downstream, resulting in a fierce air battle. However, the Japanese planes were greater in number, so some flew to Chongqing to drop bombs. (4th, Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shantou) It's a coincidence that British Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British China Fleet, just arrived here when eight Japanese planes bombed Shantou this morning. The Japanese planes dropped bombs near Heiju (Black Orange), and it is believed their target was a rice storage warehouse. There were many casualties, but the exact number is unknown. Two other cities in Guangdong province were also bombed, one being Chaozhou, 20 miles north of Shantou, and the other being Jieyang, 25 miles northwest of Shantou. Admiral Noble arrived here from Hong Kong on the British escort ship HMS Falmouth (1060 tons). (4th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Another Japanese Plane Shot Down Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Chongqing was again attacked by Japanese planes today. According to unofficial estimates, the number of casualties is between 800 and 1,000. According to official announcements, a total of 36 Japanese bombers attacked Chongqing today, flying in two batches of 18 each, dropping bombs in ten locations. One Japanese bomber was reportedly shot down. It was also said that the Japanese planes' target was apparently a certain military organization that had been relocated long ago, but due to inaccurate bombing, most bombs landed in surrounding civilian houses, causing hundreds of civilian casualties. Tonight, Chongqing presents an unusual scene. Half of the city is completely dark, with electricity and telephone service interrupted. Thousands of homeless refugees are sleeping on the roadside. Candles are lit in front of many houses, indicating that at least one resident has been killed. Some bodies have already been placed in coffins, while many others are lying on the side of the road, covered with reed mats. At the same time, the other half of the city is still brightly lit, and life goes on as usual. The authorities have refused to release the casualty figures for yesterday's attack, as detailed reports from the affected areas are not yet complete. The National Relief Committee has sent relief teams to distribute food to the affected areas and is working to resettle thousands of homeless people. Madam Chiang Kai-shek and President Kung inspected the bombed areas yesterday. The only foreigner injured yesterday was a German named Trossel, an employee of Bolton Bros., a Shanghai-based American wool company at 312 Avenue Dubail. The 32-year-old suffered a minor knee injury when the building collapsed. His office is on the same street as Reuters. During yesterday's Japanese air raid, several bombs fell into the Yangtze River, but none fell near the British and American gunboats anchored on the south bank. According to Chinese official sources, a total of 18 Japanese bombers attacked yesterday, all taking the route southeast of Chongqing, Nanchuan, instead of flying east along the Yangtze River to avoid interception by Chinese fighter planes. When Chinese planes discovered that the Japanese planes had already reached Chongqing, they turned back and engaged them in combat. A certain foreigner witnessed two people jump out of a burning plane and parachute to the ground, but could not distinguish whether they were Chinese or Japanese. Yesterday, a bomb pierced the roof of a building across from the Reuters office, only a few yards away, but fortunately did not explode. (4th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>After Indiscriminate Bombing, the Scars Are Everywhere</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Yesterday at 1 PM, just as residents of Chongqing were preparing lunch, the alarm suddenly sounded, and they rushed to the nearby air-raid shelters. Chinese fighters took off to intercept and patrolled the sky for 20 minutes before spotting Japanese bombers. The Japanese planes flew from west to east, dropping bombs along the streets of the north bank. Chinese fighters immediately engaged them, and anti-aircraft guns temporarily stopped firing to avoid interfering with Chinese operations. As a result, the sounds of planes whirring and machine guns firing were heard at the same time. After the Japanese planes fled, Chinese planes pursued them. About 30 bombs fell near the Reuters Chongqing office, narrowly avoiding being destroyed. The closest bomb landed only 15 yards away. The office of the French company, "Shu Fu" (transliteration) Shipping Company, was completely destroyed. A Reuters reporter walked just 100 yards from the office and saw the tragic scene caused by incendiary bombs. Dozens of closely spaced wooden houses were hit and caught fire, spreading rapidly. The Ta Kung Pao was also affected. Two hundred yards further, a large fire broke out on the hillside at the west end of the park. Military police and soldiers were dispatched to all bombed areas to maintain order, and traffic was cut off. Firefighters and civilian volunteers bravely fought the fires and rescued the injured. Two injured Chinese were dug out of the rubble of the French shipping company and immediately sent to the hospital. The results of the air battle and the number of casualties are currently unknown. During the air raid, a Reuters reporter was standing in the air-raid shelter, watching the actions of the Japanese bombers, when he suddenly heard the sharp sound of a falling bomb and quickly jumped into the shelter. Suddenly, with a loud roar, the ground shook, and glass bricks and tiles fell like rain. A large stone fell from the sky and landed at the entrance of the air-raid shelter, piercing the cement sidewalk to a depth of four inches. The reporter went out of the shelter again and saw that fires had broken out in seven places within a radius of 300 yards. Residents of the burning houses fled to the streets, some with minor injuries and others with blood on their faces, hands and feet. Their clothes were covered in dust. Due to a lack of stretchers, doors were taken off their hinges to carry the seriously injured to the hospital. Xincheng in the western suburbs was not affected this time. The south bank of the Yangtze River was not bombed, but a certain place far upstream was hit by bombs, indicating that the Japanese planes started bombing Chongqing from that location. Although the number of casualties is currently unknown, it must be at least 200 people. (4th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) As a result of yesterday's indiscriminate bombing of Chongqing by 27 Japanese planes, according to information learned at the time of the telegram, 18 bombs fell in densely populated urban areas, causing countless buildings to catch fire. Institutions affiliated with the Ministry of Transportation and large hotels were set on fire by the bombing, and the fires had not yet been extinguished by evening. Other partially damaged buildings included the Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, the Post Office, and four Chinese newspaper printing houses. The number of civilians killed was between 1,500 and 2,000. (4th, Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Still Lie About Not Targeting Civilians</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese naval sources, the Japanese naval air force, led by Majors Masuda and Irisa, raided Chongqing yesterday, bombing various military installations. They then engaged 30 Chinese planes in an air battle for half an hour, during which ten Chinese planes were shot down by Japanese planes. Two Japanese planes were also lost, and the remainder returned to their base under intense anti-aircraft fire. A spokesman for the Japanese Navy stated at today's weekly press briefing that Japanese pilots are under strict orders to only bomb Chinese military installations and to take care not to attack civilian houses or foreign property. Each pilot carries a map of Chongqing, and all foreign property is marked in red. (4th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi's Speech on China's War of Resistance, its Contribution to the World, Preventing the Expansion of Aggression, Expressing Gratitude to Britain and the Soviet Union for Their Substantial Aid to China</h3>
<p>(London) The China Association held its annual banquet today at Claridge's, chaired by Ambassador Guo Taiqi. Fifty Chinese guests attended, as well as many foreign guests, including British Minister for Coordination of Defence Lord Chatfield, Cabinet Minister Morrison, Chief of the Imperial General Staff Gort, Air Ministry official Streetly, Lord Cecil, Lord Davies, Lord Snell, Lord Strabolgi, MPs Milner, Moreing, Astor, the famous British poet Binyon, Counselor Howe of the British Embassy in China, former British military commander in Shanghai Mallet, British university professor Adams, General Manager of British American Tobacco Wovoven, and Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky. Ambassador Guo rose and proposed a toast to the guests, and said:</p>
<p>The depth of sympathy shown by various British quarters for China is striking, such as: (1) the issuance of a memorandum on January 4, explaining its position on the Nine-Power Treaty, and taking an important step in rebuilding international and political morality; (2) the establishment of a fund to stabilize China's foreign exchange; (3) the provision of export credit to aid China; (4) the establishment of a fund to relieve Chinese war disasters; (5) the donation of books and instruments by British universities to newly established universities in western China. This spring, both the front and rear of China have made exciting progress, and we should sincerely congratulate China. The Chinese people are now strongly united, and the inherent Sino-British friendship is becoming stronger because of recent beneficial cooperation between the two countries.</p>
<p>Ambassador Guo continued that he knew that everyone present would welcome Ambassador Maisky, whose country not only showed great friendship to China during this serious time, but also served as a support for linking Europe and Asia. From now on, Asia will not forget Europe, and Europe will not forget Asia. Ambassador Guo then welcomed Lord Chatfield, who is currently engaged in coordinating the various aspects of Britain's national defense. China is also working hard to become an active and possible focal point for coordinating various elements of general international defense. China's dual process of national revival and resistance to aggression has now produced encouraging results. The scope of aggression has not expanded further, and the world has not deteriorated further, because China has prevented it. China's contribution is now rapidly being fully recognized by the West. The Chinese leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, believes that virtue is not alone and will eventually gain neighborly assistance, and all of China agrees with this.</p>
<h3>British Minister for Coordination of Defence's Speech, Cherishing Warm Sympathy for China</h3>
<p>China's difficult struggle is similar to that of Britain. Post-war recovery will be like new flowers blooming, unstoppable.</p>
<p>Lord Chatfield rose on behalf of the guests to reply, elaborating on the reasons for Sino-British mutual understanding. He said that the Chinese are known for their trustworthiness, which has been the case since ancient times and still is today. The British also pride themselves on fulfilling their promises. We have made substantial promises recently, and the facts and decisions of the past few days have proved the reliability of our promises. The characteristic that we most admire and can benefit from is the Chinese respect for elders and sages, respecting things that exist through experience, rather than things that are easily acquired and quickly lost. Tonight, I very much wish to see China as a peaceful country, as represented in its art, rather than a land filled with war. But this is just a vain wish. China is currently suffering from useless and irreparable destruction. We are currently standing on the same precarious edge, knowing the folly of war, just as the Chinese do, but believing that when our personalities and beliefs are threatened, we must be prepared to sacrifice our lives, just as the Chinese do. During this difficult period of testing, we feel the deepest sympathy for the Chinese. The Chinese abandon their pens for swords, and we greatly admire this generous action of resisting aggression. Those who struggle arduously naturally become stronger after overcoming hardships. This is true for individuals and countries. Therefore, we firmly believe that China will emerge from the struggle as a strong country with new experience and new determination. I hope that the tragedy of nations of the same race killing each other in East Asia will soon cease, and that China will soon be able to restore its ordinary friendly relations with its island neighbors on an equal footing with its full sovereignty. Finally, I must mention one thing, that China, which is not fond of war, has produced a great leader in its time of need, a person with first-class military talent and the best qualities of his people, and who is respected worldwide. Not only that, but he also possesses the qualities that will be loved by all the people in the post-war recovery in the future. His selflessness and forgiving qualities have been seen after the Xi'an Incident. In addition, he possesses a great necessity for the future of the country, understanding China's old morality and his own cultivation. China is like a large pomelo tree, with roots so deep that they have seen thousands of years. Although the cold winter destroys its leaves and storms break its branches, it will still sprout new life from its ancient roots, and its new branches will be irrigated by Western principles and will blossom with new flowers from its old land, thriving and unstoppable. (3rd, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian reported today that the remarks made by Minister for Coordination of Defence Lord Chatfield at the annual banquet of the China Association last night represented the British's warm sympathy for the Chinese people's war of resistance, and said that such friendly words were not false. Our sympathy is not based solely on our economic interests, and the Chinese will be happy to hear the minister's words. (4th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British MPs' Questions on Far East Issues</h3>
<p>(London) The House of Commons met this afternoon, and several members raised questions about Far East issues. The proceedings are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Yunnan-Burma Railway Traffic</p>
<p>Conservative MP Sir Wilson asked whether the government was aware that the Chinese government was building a railway to the Burmese border, and could provide assurance on two matters: (a) that it would not build a railway within Burma to connect with the Chinese railway; (b) that even if there were plans for a connection, it would conduct a public investigation in advance to determine the pros and cons and obtain the consent of the Burmese parliament. Under-Secretary of State for India, Lieutenant Colonel Muirhead, replied that as far as he knew, the Chinese government had already begun building a railway from Kunming, Yunnan Province, to the Burmese border. Although the proposal to connect it with the Burmese railway had been mentioned from time to time for the past 40 years, the government would not make any decision until it had consulted various relevant parties in Burma. He asked Sir Wilson to rest assured on this point.</p>
<p>Dredging Work Stalled</p>
<p>Conservative MP Mr. Milner asked whether the work of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, which is of great importance to international shipping, has been stalled since the outbreak of war between China and Japan. Although the government has repeatedly decided to negotiate with the Japanese authorities, hoping to continue the dredging work, no results have been achieved so far. He asked whether the Foreign Secretary intends to conduct further negotiations with Japan. Under-Secretary of State Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Halifax was aware that the dredging work was of great importance. Negotiations are actively underway in Shanghai, and an agreement is expected to be reached in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Situation in Tianjin British Concession</p>
<p>Conservative MP Mr. Hanra asked whether the obstacles placed around the British Concession in Tianjin by the Japanese authorities had been removed. Under-Secretary of State Butler replied, "I will inform the House of Commons about the situation in Tianjin. There has been no change so far. The government is working hard to restore normalcy."</p>
<p>British Nationals Discriminated Against by Japan</p>
<p>Conservative MP Mr. Marsden asked whether the government had investigated the case of four British employees of a British company in Shanghai who were prevented from going to Hankou by the Japanese authorities, while two American employees of the same company were allowed to go there. Under-Secretary of State Butler replied that the incident did indeed happen as described. As far as he knew, the Japanese authorities would also allow British citizens to go to Hankou, while not allowing people from other countries to go there. (3rd, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Observatory Hurricane Report</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Observatory announced on the 4th that there is currently a hurricane at 12 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude, moving northwest by west, with winds within a radius of 60 miles. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Orders</h3>
<p>National Government Orders of the 2nd: (1) General Chen Cheng and Wei Lihuang are promoted to full generals with the rank of full general, listed as level 2. This order. (2) Lieutenant General Zhang Koukou is specially awarded the title of full general. This order.</p>
<h3>Resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov; Molotov Concurrently Assumes Office; No Fundamental Change Expected in Foreign Policy; Anglo-Soviet Negotiations to Suffer Adverse Impact</h3>
<p>(Moscow) An order from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR states that the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, submitted his resignation, which was approved. The Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Molotov, was appointed concurrently as the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs. (TASS dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The reason for the resignation of the Soviet Russian People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, has not yet been officially explained. However, regarding the impact of Litvinov's resignation, diplomatic sources here point out that Litvinov was a politician who advocated close cooperation with Western European countries and was responsible for the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations and forming an alliance with France. Therefore, it is anticipated that the negotiations between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union may suffer adverse effects after Litvinov's departure. (Haitong dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) After the resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, the Anglo-Soviet talks will be conducted by the newly appointed Foreign Minister and Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Molotov. Litvinov has been in charge of foreign affairs for ten years, and his sudden retirement has left Moscow's diplomatic circles at a loss. Yesterday at 11:30 PM, a radio report stated that Litvinov had already voluntarily resigned from the position of Foreign Minister, and the vacancy was temporarily filled by Molotov. However, in the communique issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shortly afterward, the word "temporary" was removed. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not explain the general situation, but pointed out that Litvinov was 61 or 62 years old and in poor health. (Associated Press dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) After the resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, diplomatic circles here expressed surprise today. Their initial reaction was that Litvinov's resignation might indicate the victory of the isolationist faction in the Soviet Union, as the isolationists opposed Litvinov's policy of cooperation with Western Europe. Journalists at a meeting of the China Association informed the Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Maisky, of the news, but he remained silent on the matter. Other Soviet personnel also refused to comment on Litvinov's move, but they had predicted a few days ago that if the United Kingdom and France did not accept the Soviet proposal for a strong mutual assistance treaty, the talks between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and France might break down. It is widely believed that the Soviet isolationist faction, including military leaders, believes that it is futile to win over the United Kingdom and France to stop aggression in Europe. The Soviet Union should retreat behind its defense lines, so that any direct attack on the Soviet Union can be repelled. (Associated Press dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) After the resignation of the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, well-informed sources here declared that the move was due to the prolonged and inconclusive negotiations between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. The concurrent holding of the foreign affairs portfolio by the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Molotov, is only temporary. However, responsible officials said that Litvinov's departure was due to poor health, and that rumors of a change in Soviet foreign policy were not accurate. "Because there is no so-called personal policy within the Soviet government, the consistent policy pursued by all authorities is a policy jointly owned by the Soviet government and the Communist Party." However, observers claim that Litvinov is 63 years old and physically strong, and it is unlikely that he would retire due to health reasons. He has always strongly advocated a collective security policy. At the Communist Party Congress, Stalin explicitly criticized Western European countries, saying that they wanted to start a war between Germany and the Soviet Union to solve their own difficulties, which clearly indicated his dissatisfaction with the principle of collective security. Until recently, the government suddenly decided to stop publishing the organ of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, the "Moscow Weekly" (published in French), presumably to strike at Litvinov. Moreover, Soviet newspapers did not mention a word about the progress of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, which shows that Litvinov's departure is related to the development of these negotiations, and the main reason for Litvinov's departure is that the United Kingdom and France refused to accept the Soviet proposal to conclude a military alliance treaty between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. In short, since the Munich Agreement, although the Soviet government allowed Litvinov to make a final test of the collective security policy, it has failed, and he had no choice but to submit his resignation. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Officialdom Tight-lipped</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Today's Soviet newspapers did not elaborate on Litvinov's resignation, only publishing on the front page the Soviet government's order appointing Molotov as Foreign Minister, and on another page a small notice stating that Litvinov had voluntarily resigned. Government officials also remained tight-lipped about the matter, not saying a word. Therefore, those who are overly sensitive believe that Litvinov may suffer the same fate as high-ranking officials who were dismissed in the past, ranging from imprisonment to execution. However, according to observations from diplomatic circles, Litvinov is unlikely to suffer a tragic fate. He was able to survive the previous purges unscathed, which was not due to luck. Furthermore, Litvinov participated in the May 1st celebrations this year, and his disagreement with Stalin must have been a recent matter. Litvinov believed that opposing fascism was the main purpose of Soviet foreign policy, while Stalin publicly declared in a speech a few weeks ago that Western European capitalist countries and fascist countries were birds of a feather, with no distinction between them. Stalin also accused the United Kingdom of trying to incite Germany to fight the Soviet Union, which was clearly different from Litvinov's policy of contacting the United Kingdom and France. He could not help but worry about Litvinov's mishandling of the situation, fearing that he would not be able to rein himself in, so he replaced him with Molotov. Also, it is reported that personnel in major Soviet embassies are expected to undergo changes due to Litvinov's departure, but it is difficult to predict the extent of the changes.

<h3>Britain and France Greatly Surprised by Change of Soviet Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>(London) The news of the resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, was received here last night and was considered completely unexpected. The Foreign Office was greatly surprised. According to well-informed sources, Litvinov's resignation has nothing to do with the United Kingdom's recent response to the Soviet proposal, as the reply has not yet been sent to Moscow. Diplomatic sources here pointed out that although Molotov has been the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars for many years, he is not politically important. This decision to continue in foreign affairs is expected to lead to a change in Soviet foreign policy, but it is difficult to predict its direction at this time. (Haitong dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the news of the resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, and the appointment of Molotov as his successor reached here, political and diplomatic circles in France were greatly surprised, and the general public also paid close attention. According to sources close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Litvinov's departure is due to one of two reasons: either the Soviet Union does not approve of Litvinov's Western European policy, or the government is dissatisfied with the slow progress of negotiations with Western European countries. These people expressed doubt about the future effectiveness of the Franco-Soviet alliance, and at the same time were pessimistic about future negotiations between Western European countries and Soviet Russia. (Haitong dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) Today's editorial in the Standard Evening News, after examining the various complex relationships surrounding the resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, and the various events currently occurring behind the scenes in Japan, stated that the reason why Japan is adhering to a more reasonable attitude must be in the Soviet Union's interests. The newspaper also said that the threat and pressure felt by the Soviet Union on its eastern border are easing at a time when deeper rifts are occurring between Germany and Poland in the West. The guarantees offered by the United Kingdom and France to Poland have formed a buffer between Germany and the Soviet Union. While the newspaper acknowledged that there are infinite difficulties in reaching this conclusion, it stated, "We may eventually see the lion and the lamb lying down together." The newspaper concluded by saying that Japan's refusal to formalize the Anti-Comintern Pact as an alliance makes it difficult for European dictatorships to plan a final test of war in the near future. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) British newspapers are increasingly frustrated by the slow progress of negotiations between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. Now that Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, has suddenly resigned, anxiety is even greater. Although general commentary is veiled, a pessimistic mood is evident between the lines. The Times' foreign affairs reporter declared, "Litvinov's resignation was not anticipated by British officials. It would be premature to conclude at this point that Soviet foreign policy is about to change, because according to news received here from Moscow, Soviet officials have stated that the country's policy towards Western European countries remains the same." The Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, stated, "Litvinov's resignation is not only unexpected, but also quite astonishing. Until last night, Soviet officials and the British Foreign Office had not dreamed of this. Moreover, important international negotiations are underway, and the United Kingdom's response to the Soviet proposal is scheduled to be sent within days, and it is strange that Litvinov's resignation occurred at this time. It is also noteworthy that the vacant position of People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs was not filled by Deputy Commissar Potemkin. Regardless of the reason for this change, Litvinov has served the Soviet Union to the best of his ability and has made outstanding contributions, and his retirement can be considered honorable." (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Various Speculations about the Reasons for Litvinov's Resignation</h3>
<p>(Paris) Although newspapers here consider the resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, unexpected, their views differ depending on their affiliations. There is no consensus. They have also speculated about the real reasons for this matter and its impact, with mutually different views. The Radical Socialist Party's newspaper, L'Ere Nouvelle, stated, "According to news last night, German leader Hitler has no reason to be pleased with the change of Soviet foreign affairs officials, because Stalin believes that the Soviet Union has reached a period of accepting extremely serious constraints, and wants to personally preside over foreign affairs negotiations. The new People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, is not easily intimidated in negotiations, and will certainly follow Stalin's intentions in everything. If so, then Litvinov's departure may be a representation of opposition to the current policy of the League of Nations, which can be deeply believed. We have recently learned from reliable sources that Stalin has absolutely no intention of changing the current policy of Western European countries, on the contrary, he wants to strengthen its implementation." The Socialist Party's newspaper, Le Populaire, stated that Litvinov's censure may be related to the slow progress of negotiations between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, which seems reasonable. In this regard, it can be viewed separately: one is that Litvinov's departure is due to the failure to quickly complete the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, so Molotov's succession will make accelerating the negotiations a priority; the other is that Litvinov, regardless of difficulties, continued to negotiate with the United Kingdom tirelessly, which caused disagreement with the Soviet authorities, so he was uneasy in his position. Therefore, Soviet policy will change its course in the future. It is difficult to determine which of the two views is correct at this time. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Times commented on the appointment of Soviet Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Molotov concurrently as Foreign Minister, stating that Washington diplomatic circles consider this a very serious development in the European situation. At a time when crises are rife and important international negotiations are underway, Litvinov's resignation is surprising. The reason may be that the position of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs has long been coveted, and Litvinov was finally uneasy in his position, or because the current negotiations between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union have not yet achieved success. One of the two must be the case. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Action Meant to Warn Britain and France</h3>
<p>Paris French political figures recently declared that regarding the resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, the information obtained here is incomplete and it is difficult to know its true meaning. According to news from London, the British side believes that the sudden change of Soviet foreign affairs officials while negotiations are underway among the countries concerned is regrettable. According to news from Warsaw, Poland was already concerned about Litvinov's advocacy of all countries joining the collective security system accepting automatic joint obligations, and his departure has been a relief. Political figures here have commented, stating that the change of Soviet foreign affairs officials does not necessarily mean a change in foreign policy. The Soviet government is hesitant about accepting certain obligations in the Far East and along the Baltic Sea coast, and is using this to warn them. In other words, Litvinov's retirement is intended to point out to the British and French governments the great value of Soviet cooperation during the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, before Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck delivers a speech. In addition, it is widely rumored in Moscow that the concurrent holding of the foreign affairs portfolio by Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Molotov is only temporary, and it is highly possible that Deputy Commissar Potemkin will be promoted to the position. Potemkin once served as the ambassador to France, and is currently negotiating an agreement with the Turkish authorities in the Turkish capital to supplement the guarantees proposed by the United Kingdom and France (that the United Kingdom and France have already given unilateral guarantees to Turkey), which has actually been completed. It would be a good thing for Soviet foreign affairs to be presided over by him. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Berlin Closely Watches Soviet Foreign Policy Trends</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The general public here is indifferent to the resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov. The newspapers say that Litvinov was a great enemy of communism, and his departure is welcome news for Germany. In addition, government officials say that individual advances and retreats are not of great importance. What needs to be verified now is whether Soviet foreign policy is still linked to the Third International, in other words, whether it still aims at world revolution. If Soviet policy remains the same, then Germany's current policy will not change. However, it can be asserted that the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Western European countries will inevitably be affected by Litvinov's departure. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Officials here refused to comment on the resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, today. All newspapers believe that Litvinov's resignation is only related to Western European countries, and Germany can deal with it calmly. A certain German newspaper said, "We can fairly assume that Litvinov's retirement at this time is often detrimental to the United Kingdom and France. Some countries deeply understand their own unsoundness and are now running around begging other countries for help. As for whether the new People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, will follow the old rules or find another path, it is still unknown." Another German newspaper said that Litvinov's resignation is a "failure" of Soviet foreign policy in Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, and the Western Hemisphere. Those who bear heavy diplomatic responsibilities should resign. (Associated Press dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Brief Biography of Molotov</h3>
<p>(Moscow) After Molotov was ordered to succeed Litvinov as the Soviet Russian People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, the world paid close attention to Molotov. Molotov is currently 49 years old, born in Kukarka in 1890. His original name was Scriabin, which he later changed to his current name. He joined the Communist Party in 1906, and in 1924 he was appointed as a member of the Communist Party's Politburo. It is said that his understanding of foreign affairs and politics is quite limited. (Haitong dispatch, 4th) The Morning Express reported that the new Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, does not approve of the collective security system, either in theory or in practice. In particular, he is a confidant of Stalin and deeply loved by the Red Army. His policy is based on peace and balance of power, and he is resolute and ambitious. He has repeatedly launched fierce attacks against Germany, which has always been known as a deadly enemy of National Socialism. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>

<h3>Negotiations on Collective Security Organization Have Not Yet Achieved Success; Taking Advantage of the League of Nations Meeting on the 15th, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union Will Continue Discussions in Geneva</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the organization of a collective security system, the foreign affairs officials of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union will take advantage of the regular meeting of the League of Nations Council on the 15th of this month to discuss everything in Geneva. The talks between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union may not achieve any success before the 15th, but the new proposal submitted by the British government to the Soviet Union has been handed over by Foreign Office official Cadogan to French Ambassador Corbin, and its content advocates: (1) The Soviet Union provides guarantees to the countries along the Baltic and Black Seas. This guarantee will only be implemented when the United Kingdom and France provide assistance to these countries. (2) Once the Soviet Union provides unilateral guarantees to these countries, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union should establish a mutual assistance agreement. However, this new proposal is not intended to be sent to the Soviet government for the time being, for four reasons: (1) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today, "The claim that the United Kingdom is pursuing a policy of encirclement is baseless. I have clearly stated that the British government is happy to consider all proposals aimed at mutual guarantees between the United Kingdom and Germany. Attention must be paid to how the German government responds to this expression from the Prime Minister." (2) Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck is scheduled to deliver a speech in the House on the 5th of this month to respond to German leader Hitler, and it may be possible to open up a path for friendly negotiations between Germany and Poland. (3) After the German government proposed to the governments of the Nordic countries to conclude non-aggression pacts, the foreign ministers of these countries are scheduled to hold a meeting in the Swedish capital on the 9th of this month to discuss them. It is also necessary to know the views of these countries. (4) Recently, Italy's attitude towards Western European countries has been significantly more conciliatory. The country's newspapers no longer carry out anti-French propaganda; relations between Italy and Egypt have improved, and the Governor of Italian Libya, General Balbo, will soon visit Egypt; according to news from Rome, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is scheduled to go to Italy tomorrow because of difficulties in the discussion of military cooperation between Germany and Italy. It is said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has expressed disagreement with the proposal that Italy should automatically fight alongside Germany when war breaks out, regardless of where the war starts. In short, when the United Kingdom will send the new proposal to the Soviet government always depends on the evolution of the situation. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Well-informed sources here recently commented on the resignation of People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, stating that the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and France, namely the negotiations on organizing a collective security system, are clearly related to this matter. The United Kingdom and France, in providing guarantees to Romania and Greece, did not ask these countries to provide the same guarantees, nor did they consult the Soviet Union in advance, which the Soviet side already felt unhappy about, and has always believed that only cooperation between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union can form collective security. However, the United Kingdom and France did not establish an understanding with the Soviet Union and hastily provided guarantees to small countries, which inevitably reversed the order. At this point, the United Kingdom and France cannot force small countries to accept Soviet cooperation, which is not self-inflicted? Moreover, since the Munich Agreement, the Soviet Union has been forced to pursue an isolationist policy, and can leave Western European countries without fear because of its strong national power. Moreover, both Germany and Italy are contacting the Soviet Union, either proposing to conclude commercial agreements or promoting trade, which shows that it is not difficult for the Soviet Union to abandon its isolationist policy. After all, it is still willing to cooperate with Western European countries again on an equal footing, accepting reciprocal obligations, and providing practical guarantees to each other.

<h3>German Diplomacy Actively Engaged; Foreign Minister Visits Rome</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will travel to Rome tonight to hold several days of discussions with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. (Associated Press dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is scheduled to go to Italy today to hold talks with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. Well-informed sources here commented that the Foreign Minister's trip is a sign of Germany's active diplomatic engagement in all areas. It is necessary to consult with Italy in advance to agree on a unified action of the Berlin-Rome axis on various issues. Regarding Germany's negotiations with the Scandinavian Peninsula countries (namely Denmark, Norway, and Sweden) and the Baltic Sea coastal countries (namely Finland, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia), the German government has not yet made proposals, but has only exchanged views with these countries. It is too early to say that the German government has provided guarantees to these countries or proposed to sign non-aggression pacts with these countries. It is also not accurate to say that the German government has held the same talks with Greece, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, but Germany is currently exchanging views with the Scandinavian Peninsula and Baltic Sea coastal countries, which may extend to other countries, including those listed by US President Roosevelt in his telegram. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German leader Hitler suggested today that Germany, while waiting for Polish Foreign Minister Beck's reply, should consolidate its northern and southern fronts. The German government announced that it had agreed with Sweden and Finland to set up defenses on the Aland Islands, and at the same time announced that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop would travel to Rome to hold a meeting with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. Some neutral observers believe that the German Foreign Minister's trip to Rome has a very unusual nature, as it aims to dispel Italy's misunderstanding of Germany's policy towards England. Moreover, since Italy has very close relations with Poland, the Roman authorities are deeply concerned about the tense relations between Germany and Poland. Germany's actions towards Danzig or the Polish Corridor may use the axis policy to seek its own interests, while on the Italian side, although it defends Germany's back door, it is in vain. At the same time, Rome fears that Germany's problem with Poland may drag Italy into a war vortex, and Italy has no direct interest in this kind of war. (Associated Press dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Well-informed sources here declared that Aviation Minister General Goering went to San Remo, Italy, yesterday, and is scheduled to arrive at 6:30 PM today, and is scheduled to stay for a week. Mrs. Goering did not accompany him. Officials here refused to comment on Goering's trip, and the outside world knows nothing about the reason. Some sources said that when the Spanish National Army enters Madrid in triumph on the 15th of this month, General Goering will also represent Germany and leader Hitler himself to participate, but officials and semi-officials have not yet confirmed it.

<h3>Poland Resists German Aggression; France Willing to Provide Backup; Polish Foreign Minister to Issue Declaration Today Responding to German Demands on Danzig</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to semi-official sources, the French government has asserted that if Germany takes any action in Danzig and Poland resists such action, France is willing to aid Poland. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Foreign Minister Beck is scheduled to deliver a declaration at the House of Representatives at 11:30 tomorrow morning in response to Chancellor Hitler's speech on the 28th of last month. Foreign Minister Sempek met yesterday with British Ambassador Kennard to explain the main points of the declaration. According to sources close to the government, the declaration is not very long and is expected to take only half an hour. Although the wording will be firm, it will be delivered in a diplomatic tone, without any alarming nature, contrary to what is widely reported in the newspapers. The authorities have also decided to broadcast it nationwide through wireless radio stations, and after translating it into French, it will be rebroadcast by French radio stations. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Experienced observers here have recently stated that after the Polish government adopted a tough stance on the issue of the Free City of Danzig, the German authorities seem to be in a predicament. Their proposed actions against Poland have been delayed, and in the future, they will likely be replaced by long-term actions. The reactions of Britain and France are also quite disappointing, which is one of the reasons why Germany is cautious in dealing with Poland. In addition, the attitude of Italy must also be ascertained before taking offensive actions against Poland. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Italy is for this reason. As for Germany's proposal to establish non-aggression pacts with the Nordic countries, there are two purposes: one is to correct the negative impression caused by Germany's abolition of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact; the other is to prepare for future conflicts between Germany and Poland, so that all Nordic countries can maintain neutrality.

<h3>Polish National Day; Public Demonstrations; Chanting Anti-German Slogans</h3>
<p>Warsaw: During the military parade held here yesterday to celebrate National Day, the crowds repeatedly chanted anti-German slogans such as "Long live Polish Danzig," "Long live Polish East Prussia," and "Down with Hitler." When two cars from the German embassy, displaying the swastika flag, drove past, the crowds booed. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministers Meeting of Four Nordic Countries</h3>
<p>To be held in Stockholm next Tuesday to discuss the treaty with Germany</p>
<p>Copenhagen: Responsible officials here have recently stated that after Germany proposed yesterday to the Nordic countries, namely Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, to conclude a mutual non-aggression pact, the foreign ministers of these countries are scheduled to hold a meeting in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, on the 9th of this month to discuss it. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) "Le Journal" reported that Germany recently proposed to the Nordic and Baltic countries to conclude a mutual non-aggression pact, which has caused great turmoil here. According to the newspaper's diplomatic correspondent, Germany took this step in response to the Soviet Union's joining France and the Baltic countries to form a mutual assistance pact. The correspondent believes that if Germany's proposal succeeds, the effectiveness of the Soviet Union's joining the mutual assistance pact will be completely lost. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen: It is reported that Germany, in order to maintain the neutrality of its northern region in the event of a major war, has proposed to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia to conclude a non-aggression pact. According to a statement issued by the Berlin authorities, if Sweden and Finland can maintain absolute neutrality in a future world war, then both countries can build defenses on the Åland Islands. Germany intends to prevent the Åland Islands from being seized by the Soviet Union and used as a base for naval and air forces, which would be detrimental to Germany. Based on this, if Germany's non-aggression treaty with the Scandinavian countries can be concluded, then Germany may not occupy the Åland Islands. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<h3>Romanian Foreign Minister Leaves Italy for Home; Cordial Talks in Rome</h3>
<p>(Rome) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu departed for home this evening. Foreign Minister Ciano and other dignitaries saw him off at the station. According to an official statement, "Foreign Minister Gafencu held extremely cordial talks with Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano on various issues of interest to both Italy and Romania, and satisfactory results have been achieved." Before his departure, Gafencu told the press that his visit to various countries was purely informal and no agreements were concluded with any country. The friendly relations between Italy and Romania have not changed due to Italy's occupation of Albania. The relationship between the two countries is not only emotional but also of great economic value. Today, all countries hope for peace, but their concepts of peace are not consistent. As for the relationship between Germany and Poland, it is indeed very serious. It is hoped that both sides can find a solution through mutual understanding. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Japan's Policy to Deal with the European Situation; Repeated Meetings; Careful Consideration</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita entered the palace at 11:20 this morning to report to the Emperor on diplomatic affairs and the latest developments in the European situation. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that after repeated meetings of the five ministers and frequent meetings with important cabinet members, Japan has formulated a policy regarding the European situation. These meetings culminated in meetings between Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, and Navy Minister Yonai. The newspaper expects that the five-minister meeting will soon formally approve Japan's policy toward Europe. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) It is rumored that Germany, Italy, and Japan are currently conducting negotiations to discuss the issue of concluding a military alliance treaty. Responsible officials here have denied this. According to news from Tokyo, although Japanese Foreign Minister Arita met with the ambassadors of Germany and Italy to discuss the European situation, the purpose was to obtain accurate information from the most reliable sources. It is natural for Japan to be concerned about the European situation. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Army and Navy Officers Study Strengthening Defenses at the Panama Canal; Plan to Build Strong Naval and Air Bases in Mexico; $150 Million in Defense Funds Approved by President</h3>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Army and Navy officers are currently studying plans to build strong naval and air bases at the Pacific entrance to the Panama Canal. The main base will be built in Acapulco, Mexico, and an air base will also be established on the Galapagos Islands, which belong to Ecuador. The Army and Navy Departments are now asking the State Department to negotiate with Mexico and Ecuador on how to lease land. It is reported that the Mexican government has expressed its willingness to negotiate on this point, which will be discussed together with the case of the expropriation of U.S. oil rights.

<h3>Hull Explains U.S. Policy; Military and Economic Power as Weapons; Safeguarding the Security of the New World</h3>
<p>(New York) Assistant Secretary of State Hull recently delivered a speech at the local Political Academy, stating that President Roosevelt said that if any party threatens the independence of the Americas with force, the United States will respond with appropriate military measures. If the Americas suffer economic threats, the United States will also provide full economic assistance. In short, the policy pursued by the United States in Latin America is a policy of peace and understanding, with the goal of maintaining the independence of the Americas, which is completely different from the so-called Roman peace in history, which only focused on conquest. This policy began to be implemented when Spanish power in the Americas was eliminated, and after the Monroe Doctrine was promoted, it began to take shape, and after the declaration of American Continental Solidarity was issued last year, it was fully realized. This declaration stated that the American countries should adjust their actions to safeguard territorial integrity and political systems. In short, the Roman concept of peace has been replaced by the concept of an "international community." To this day, a certain country is engaged in political and economic propaganda in the Americas, and German newspapers even say that a certain American country has failed to fully develop its resources, and the land inhabited by white people is therefore threatened. For example, most of Brazil should be controlled by Germany. All this is the "vital space" doctrine promoted by Germany, which should be attacked by all. Some people are worried that fascism, national socialism, and communism are trying to promote their ideas in the Americas. In fact, although this kind of propaganda wants to destroy the unity of the Americas and inject new imperialism into the Americas, there is no need to worry too much. Since the United States is a pillar of American Continental Solidarity, various movements, whether belonging to communism or originating from the German-Italian axis, are all aimed at our country. We know how to deal with it. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Warships Cruise the Far East; Four Arrive in Singapore; Japan Attaches Great Importance</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the "Asahi Shimbun," four Soviet mine-laying ships that left their Black Sea base in early April for Vladivostok have now approached the Straits Settlements and may arrive in Singapore tomorrow. It is reported that the ships passed through the Suez Canal on April 11 and sailed out of Colombo at the end of April. A special dispatch from Singapore published by the "Asahi Shimbun" stated that a mysterious submarine fleet has been seen outside Singapore. The newspaper attaches great importance to the possible activities of the Soviet warships after they arrive in Vladivostok. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Regarding the news of Soviet warships cruising the Far East, opinions vary. It is generally believed that these warships include one destroyer and one submarine, as well as two mine-laying ships. Some say that the ships may arrive in Singapore tomorrow, while others say that they may arrive in Manila tomorrow and will be berthed there until May 12. However, there is currently no news of the ships coming to Hong Kong. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>U.S. President Plans to Promote the Implementation of New Neutrality Legislation; As a Response to Hitler's Speech; So That Arms Can Be Supplied to Britain and France in Wartime</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to responsible sources here, President Roosevelt's only response to Hitler's speech will be to submit to Congress a request to implement the new neutrality legislation for cash-and-carry. It is reported that this plan will allow the United States to supply arms to Britain and France in the event of war, as long as Britain and France can pay the necessary cash. It is also reported that President Roosevelt has decided not to issue a rebuttal to Hitler's speech. White House Secretary O'Leary stated today, "Now that we have a period that seems to be slightly stable, why should we add weight to one side of the scale?" (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to sources close to President Roosevelt, the President does not wish to take action to promote the resolution of international disputes for the time being, as the international situation has become more relaxed. However, he is still closely monitoring the international situation. Previously, the U.S. President had a plan to unite the countries of the Americas with the countries of Europe and Germany to sign an anti-aggression pact. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>

<h3>The Japanese Army Invading Guangdong's Strategy of Occupying Danshui Estuary</h3>
<p>Planning to attack Heshan and Gaoming to threaten Zhaoqing; Chinese military authorities have made strict preparations</p>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondent: The Japanese army invading Siyi launched an attack on Danshui Estuary on April 25, with troops advancing by both land and water from Xinhui. The waterway involved the use of shallow-water boats, pushing in from the Fenshui River; the land route involved the use of cavalry and armored vehicles, pushing forward along Daze Siqian. At the same time, aircraft were dispatched for bombing and cover. Under the fierce attacks of the Japanese army's land, sea, and air forces, the Chinese army resisted all day on the 25th and 26th. Various defense works were destroyed, and they withdrew their positions from Danshui Estuary, retreating towards Zhaiwu, which belongs to Heshan, and Kaiping. As a result, the situation in Taikai and Heshan counties suddenly became tense. The current situation is as follows: Xinchang Dihai, which belongs to Taishan County, and Changsha Sanbu, which belongs to Kaiping County, are located 45 li upstream of Danshui Estuary. The area is connected in a triangular shape, with thriving commerce and convenient transportation. After the front of the Xijiang River was blocked, the counties along the south bank of the Xijiang River have been using tributaries to communicate with Jiangmen and Macau for several months. After the successive fall of Jiangmen and Xinhui, Siyi can still use the transfer of Sanbu to reach Macau. Now that Danshui Estuary has fallen again, the only tributary of the Xijiang River leading to the sea is completely blocked. On the 27th, two Japanese shallow-water warships and five or six rubber boats were suddenly found patrolling the river surface of Sanbu. The guerrillas on both sides opened fire, and the Japanese army retreated back to the river surface of Danshui Estuary without landing. Currently, the population of Sanbu has been ordered to evacuate, and shops and residents are moving to other places. The ferry between Macau and Qianshan has been completely suspended because the river surface of Danshui Estuary has been cut off by the Japanese army, and ships cannot pass through. The roads in the nearby villages have also been completely destroyed, and the entire territory of Siyi has entered a state of extreme emergency.</p>
<p>According to military observers, after the Japanese army occupied Danshui Estuary, they can in fact control Siyi, and the fall of Sanbu is also imminent. The terrain of Sanbu is flat, with no danger to defend, and it only takes an hour to go upstream from Danshui Estuary. However, from a military point of view, Sanbu has no important value. If the Japanese army wants to invade Gaolei in the south, they can choose a landing area on the Leizhou Peninsula without having to advance from Sanbu. If they must invade from Sanbu, they will have to cross Enping, Yangjiang, and Dianbai. If so, the battle line will be too long, and there is a risk of being defeated by the Chinese army everywhere. Based on this observation, it can be asserted that there will be no major battles in Sanbu. However, the purpose of the Japanese army's fight for Danshui Estuary this time is to block the transportation of Siyi on the one hand, to cut off the supplies and transportation in the guerrilla area, and on the other hand to cover the Japanese army in the Xijiang River, attacking Heshan and Gaoming, as a prelude to the capture of Zhaoqing. This shows the strategy of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>The southwest military authorities have made comprehensive preparations for the actions of the Japanese army. For Siyi, it is divided into guerrilla areas, and the "scorched earth" plan is used to thoroughly evacuate the people, move food and all resources, and ensure that no grain or resource is left to help the enemy, so as to stop the Japanese army from advancing. Heavy troops are stationed in the mountainous areas of Gaohe and other counties, and solid fortifications are built to prepare for a fierce mountain battle with the Japanese army to consume the strength of the Japanese army. Cai Tingkai, the newly arrived Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the ×× Group Army in Guangxi, is in command of the military affairs of Siyi, and Deng Longguang is in command of the military affairs of Xijiang and Gaohe. Cai and Deng have now personally gone to the front line to plan everything.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Orders All Counties to Ban Grain Exports Again</h3>
<p>In order to maintain food supply for the people and the army</p>
<p>Xinghua Correspondent: The Jiangsu Provincial Government has repeatedly issued orders to prohibit the export of food. Recently, as the Japanese army has gradually penetrated inland and is approaching the border, the previous ban on Jiangkou and Haikou cannot be effectively enforced everywhere. According to recent investigations, grain merchants often use the excuse of inland circulation to purchase and smuggle grain from various counties, taking the opportunity to profit, resulting in the price of wheat rising to more than eight yuan per dan and the price of rice rising to between five and six yuan in recent months. This province is now suffering from the aftermath of war and floods, and food is already scarce. If smuggling is still allowed, the food supply for the people and the army will be at risk. Therefore, it is specially re-stipulated and ordered that the county magistrates of all counties shall only allow the circulation of rice and wheat within the county boundaries, and prohibit transportation out of the county. All public officials, autonomous personnel, and team officers and soldiers should strengthen the protection of rice and wheat within the county boundaries. If there are any cases of delays, extortion, or fraud, the county magistrate should investigate and deal with them strictly to warn against illegal activities. If there is a real need for mutual supply of food between counties, the person applying for supply should submit a statement stating the facts of the need for supply, its type and quantity, the supply location, and the names and addresses of the purchasers. After the county magistrate in charge is responsible for reviewing and confirming the information, he should consult with the neighboring county and report it to the province for approval. Then, the county will fill out a purchase and transportation certificate and purchase from the neighboring county, and exchange it for a transportation certificate before it can be transported to the supply location. Those who use public office for personal gain, attempt to aid the enemy, or seek to profit by deception will be severely punished according to the law once they are discovered or reported. The county magistrate in charge should also be severely punished to clarify responsibility. The case is related to prohibiting food from aiding the enemy and maintaining the food supply for the people and the army, so it must be handled effectively and without negligence.</p>

<p>Taixian Correspondent: The floods suffered in Huaiyin, Huaian, Siyang, Baoying, and Binhu areas last autumn were extremely tragic.

Disaster victims are everywhere and urgently need relief. The Huaiyin County Government previously reported the disaster situation to the province, stating that the masses of refugees in the urban area gathered in Huxiang, and in addition to the flood disaster, there was also military disaster. It is requested that a huge sum of money be allocated quickly to carry out emergency relief work. At the same time, the provincial government secretary-general turned to Acting Chairman Han and requested that 3,000 shi of wheat stored in Huaian be allocated to Huaiyin, Huaian, and Baoying counties to jointly deal with the emergency relief work in Huxi, and to allocate more than 1,000 bags of wheat to the Huaiyin County Magistrate to organize relief work along the lake to facilitate bilateral rescue.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Education Department Evaluates Teacher Qualifications</h3>
<p>University Graduates Classified as Level One; Non-University Graduates as Level Two</p>
<p>The male and female teachers of the Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement had previously requested the council to re-evaluate their positions. The council then submitted this matter for discussion, believing that there were sufficient reasons for it to be considered by the Evaluation Committee. After hearing the opinions of the Director of the Education Department, the committee believed that this matter should indeed be further studied and resolved to suggest to the board of directors that the existing grading system be appropriately modified. University graduates who have received specialized training and hold certificates are currently classified in Level 1 of Category Two (D) and Level 1 of Category Two (E) in the Specialist Personnel (Education) category. Non-university graduates who have received specialized training and hold certificates are classified in Level 2 of Category Two (D) and Level 2 of Category Two (E). However, after nine years of service, those with excellent performance and proven teaching ability may also be promoted to Level One. The Education Committee has now proposed that male teachers belonging to Level 1 of Category Two (D) and female teachers belonging to Category Two (E) be classified in Category (A) of the staff. However, there are some differences regarding the benefits that married female staff in Category (A) should enjoy. According to the newly proposed method, male and female teachers belonging to Level Two will still be classified in Category (B). However, after fourteen years of service, they may be promoted to Level One and enjoy the benefits that Category (A) staff should enjoy. The Evaluation Committee's recommendations have been adopted by the board of directors.</p>
<h3>Guanghua Alumni Association Elects New Officers</h3>

With continued efforts, the old appearance will surely be restored. The vice president, Pan Xuzu, reported on the recent situation of the alma mater, stating that the university department had over 700 students and the middle school department had over 900 students.

With the president working so hard to run the school, we alumni should strive even harder for the alma mater. The alumni applauded upon hearing this. Subsequently, nine executive committee members were re-elected. Those elected were Pan Xuzu, Zhang Yuelian, Xue Difu, Zhang Hualian, Dong Xiaopei, Zhang Zupei, Tang Shudi, Yao Zhang, and Zhao Tiezhang. By a majority, Zhao Jiabi was elected.

<h3>City Celebrates Anniversary of Revolutionary Government's Establishment by Hanging Flags</h3>
<p>Notices Issued by Both Settlement Taxpayer Associations; Various Groups Release Open Letters to Fellow Citizens</p>
<p>Today marks the 18th anniversary of the establishment of the Revolutionary Government by the Premier of the Kuomintang as Extraordinary Grand President. All citizens of the city, in accordance with the central government's regulations and the joint decision of various sectors in the city, should voluntarily hang flags for one day to celebrate. Various groups have also released open letters to the public, encouraging fellow citizens to strengthen their beliefs. Regarding past flag-hanging negotiations, various central ministries and departments have sent telegrams of condolences. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Flag-Hanging Notices</p>
<p>(1) The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the International Settlement announced: It has been temporarily decided by various groups that citizens of the International Settlement will hang the national flag for a total of eight days per year, including January 1st, March 12th, March 29th, May 5th, July 1st, August 27th, October 10th, and November 12th. This is hereby announced. (2) The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession announced: For notification purposes, May 5th is the anniversary of Sun Premier's inauguration as Extraordinary Grand President. All citizens within our concession should hang the national flag on that day to celebrate enthusiastically. This is of utmost importance. This notice is hereby issued.</p>
<p>Open Letters to Fellow Citizens</p>
<p>The open letters to fellow citizens issued by various groups are summarized as follows: (1) In the tenth year of the Republic of China, warlords and politicians destroyed laws and discipline and attempted to undermine the revolutionary forces led by our party. In order to reorganize the revolutionary ranks and consolidate the foundation of the country, the Premier assumed the position of Extraordinary Grand President elected by the Extraordinary National Assembly in Guangdong on May 5th of the tenth year of the Republic of China, and established the Revolutionary Government, laying the foundation for the establishment of the National Government. All fellow citizens of our city should deeply understand and earnestly emulate this spirit of great fearlessness and struggle. (2) The Premier devoted his life to fighting against all counter-revolutionary forces, with the aim of seeking China's independence, freedom, and equality. Today, the all-out war of resistance is rapidly unfolding. Soldiers throughout the country are building a great wall with their blood and flesh, and fellow citizens throughout the country are contributing manpower, materials, and financial resources to the government. The aim is also to strive for national independence, freedom, and equality. Therefore, as we commemorate the establishment of the Revolutionary Government today, we should further strengthen the spirit of struggle, strengthen our will, and complete the Premier's unfinished business. (3) In the first phase of the war of resistance, both spirit and matter were equally important. In the second phase of the war of resistance, spirit is more important than matter. The psychological construction indicated in the Premier's teachings is the highest theoretical basis, and the program promulgated by Chairman Chiang and its implementation methods are different plans for implementing the Premier's psychological construction teachings. Therefore, as we commemorate the establishment of the Revolutionary Government, we should personally practice with an organized spirit, use manpower, material resources, and financial resources to lay the cornerstone of inevitable victory.</p>
<p>Central Government Condolences</p>
<p>(1) The Central Propaganda Department sent a telegram: The enthusiastic promotion by the citizens of Shanghai demonstrates a deep patriotism, which is deeply appreciated. Looking east from Bayu, we are filled with concern. Please convey the Central Committee's utmost concern. (2) The Central Social Affairs Department sent a telegram: The flag-hanging case has reached the sky, and the spirit of struggle of the Shanghai citizens is admired by China and foreign countries alike. Now that we have heard that all arrested compatriots are safe and sound, we are pleased and send this telegram of condolences. (3) The Central Secretariat sent a telegram: Regarding the flag-hanging matter, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently replied that after receiving the news, the Ministry has made representations to the French Embassy. The reply stated that the flag had been returned, and the person had been released. A written protest was also lodged on the following day, requesting that necessary steps be taken to correct the situation and that the freedom of our residents to hang flags should not be interfered with again. This is specially notified for your reference.</p>
<h3>French Concession Maintains Security</h3>
<p>In order to maintain order and security within the French Concession and prevent unscrupulous individuals from taking advantage of opportunities to cause trouble, the French Concession police authorities have dispatched all Chinese, French, Vietnamese, and Russian detectives on duty to patrol in sections to maintain security. However, because all Chinese detectives have been dispatched on duty, they have no time to attend court in the Second Special District Court to report on the cases they are handling. Therefore, the police department has scheduled to suspend the interrogation of public prosecution cases for one day today, that is, old cases that were previously interrogated will be rescheduled, and those that were scheduled to be re-examined today will also be postponed. The court will proceed with civil and criminal self-prosecution cases as usual today. The French police department also handled the situation in this manner on May 1, International Labor Day. This shows the administrative and police authorities of the French Concession's painstaking efforts to maintain order and security within the concession.</p>
<h3>Dead and Wounded Japanese Soldiers Continuously Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 7:00 AM, another Japanese military truck loaded with corpses was seen on Minguo Road in the southern part of the city. It was reported that this corpse truck came from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. Due to the recent battles in Xiashi and Fengshumiao, as well as on the Sujia Road, there have been many Japanese casualties. The guerrilla warfare on other roads is also very fierce. Therefore, the Japanese side has changed the timetable for the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou trains since April 21st to allow the locomotives to transport Japanese troops and military supplies.</p>
<h3>Rumor that Chen Bijun Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>It is rumored that Chen Bijun, who has been residing in Hanoi, arrived in Shanghai alone by plane the day before yesterday (the 3rd). When the plane arrived at the Datang Airport, traffic in the Hongkou area was cut off, and Japanese soldiers were stationed three steps apart and five steps apart, with strict security. After Chen got off the plane, she changed to a car prepared by the Japanese and drove directly to the Broadway Mansion on North Suzhou Road. It is reported that Chen came here to absorb female members in an attempt to organize a "Chinese Women's National Salvation Association" to support her husband. Such outrageous actions by Wang and Chen will surely be abandoned by the people of the country.</p>
<h3>Japan Attempts to Reorganize Concessions, British Government Refuses, Spokesman Says Amendment to Land Regulations Must be Approved by Chinese Government</h3>
<p>(Associated Press, London, 4th) A British government spokesman refused yesterday evening to reorganize the administration of the Shanghai International Settlement, saying the British government believes the current administrative system in Shanghai is fair to both Japan and Britain. The spokesman was addressing the Japanese demands presented yesterday by Japanese Foreign Ministry official Renzo Sawada to the British and American ambassadors in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Several Clauses of Japanese Demands</p>
<p>The demand includes a reply to the protests lodged by Britain and the United States with Japan two months ago over incidents involving Japan and third countries in Shanghai. The Japanese government also demanded that the general status of Japanese personnel in the Municipal Council be raised and that the number of Japanese representatives in the Municipal Council be increased. In addition, the suppression of anti-Japanese activities and terrorist parties in the International Settlement is also among the demands.</p>
<p>British Taxes Twice Those of Japanese</p>
<p>A British government spokesman said in a solemn tone last night that Britain considers the current administrative system in Shanghai to be extremely fair. He acknowledged Japan's claim that Japanese investment in Shanghai has substantially increased, but at the same time pointed out that the property taxes and donations paid by the British in Shanghai are almost twice those paid by the Japanese. Therefore, the ratio of British to Japanese representatives on the Municipal Council, at five to two, is fair.</p>
<p>Amendment of Regulations is a Legal Issue</p>
<p>The British government spokesman also emphasized that amendments to the Land Regulations must be approved by the Chinese government in Chongqing before they can be made. However, he believes that such consent is unlikely to be obtained. If the Land Regulations are amended solely on the basis of the wishes of a "puppet organization," there are concerns that legal problems will arise and that the amendments will not be effective.</p>
<p>Limits to British-Japanese Cooperation</p>
<p>As for the Japanese demand for practical recognition of the "Great Way Municipal Government" under Japanese control, unofficial sources here believe that the maximum extent of cooperation between Britain and Japan to adjust the situation in the Shanghai International Settlement may only be to increase efforts to control anti-Japanese movements and anti-Japanese terrorists.</p>
<p>Sanctions Against Anti-Japanese Elements Have Succeeded</p>
<p>Several sources pointed out that Japan has declared that it has no territorial ambitions in China other than to conquer China and confiscate Chinese property. However, Japan's current investment has not yet exceeded the British investment by a ratio of five to two. The Shanghai Municipal Council has taken active steps to control anti-Japanese terrorist activities. The results of these efforts have been considerable in controlling terrorist activities and sabotage in Japanese-occupied areas.</p>
<p>British Speculate on Japanese Intentions</p>
<p>The British believe that the Japanese complaint about unfair treatment by the Municipal Council's police department is the result of the Municipal Council's recent steps to improve the status and representation of Japanese in the police department not satisfying the Japanese. They recall that the Municipal Council has not yet met the Japanese demand for the number of police personnel. The fact that Japan failed to obtain a larger number of representatives in the recent Municipal Council elections has also been discussed here as a possible reason.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Defense Commander Officially Approves the Resumption of Navigation to Wenzhou</h3>
<p>Passengers Detained on the "Hana" Vessel Are Safe and Sound. The "Haifu" Vessel Postpones its Scheduled Trip to Dinghai, Seeking to Change the Date for Sailing to Wenzhou. Passengers from the "Deping" Vessel Disembark Before it Docks.</p>
<p>Following the concentration of Japanese warships in the waters off eastern Zhejiang, with apparent intentions, the Zhejiang military authorities, to strengthen defenses, temporarily prohibited navigation to all coastal ports. Now, with military deployments completed, in addition to approving the resumption of navigation on the Ningbo and Shanghai lines, foreign vessels are also permitted to resume navigation to Wenzhou. Yesterday, a Japanese warship detained the "Hana" vessel on the Shanghai-Dinghai line. As a result, the "Haifu" vessel decided to temporarily postpone its scheduled voyage to Dinghai. Gao Dengwei and Jin have been escorted to Shanghai. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>**Disembarkation of Personnel from the "Deping"**</p>
<p>The Italian company, Zhongyi Company's "Deping" vessel, specially chartered by the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo to handle emergency relief. After being blocked and returning to Shanghai, it was detained by a Japanese warship outside Wusongkou. Following negotiations by the Italian Consul General in Shanghai, it finally entered the port yesterday morning and berthed between buoys No. 20 and No. 21 in Yangshupu. As for the crew and passengers (including doctors and nurses sent to Ningbo), they were transported to the New Customs Wharf by small steamers yesterday afternoon to disembark. Dong Xinqin, a representative specially sent by the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, welcomed them. However, they were subjected to inspection by customs tax police upon landing. The company believes that the vessel has regained its freedom.</p>
<p>**"Hana" Forced to Stop Sailing to Dinghai**</p>
<p>After the "Hana" vessel of the German Far East Company in this port was approved by the Ningbo Defense Commander to resume navigation, the vessel departed from Shanghai for Dinghai at 4:00 PM yesterday. At 8:00 AM yesterday, when it sailed to the waters near Dinghai called "Bandaocha Ming Banhai" (lit. "Peninsula Fork Named Half Sea"), it was suddenly forced to stop sailing by a Japanese warship stationed in those waters. Japanese soldiers boarded the vessel for inspection, which had not been completed as of 6:00 PM yesterday. According to company sources, the vessel sent telegrams to Shanghai from time to time to report the situation. However, there is no confirmed news as to whether it can sail to Dinghai. The "Haifu" vessel, originally scheduled to sail to Dinghai yesterday, has also suspended its voyage and refunded tickets.</p>
<p>**Approval for Foreign Vessels to Resume Navigation to Wenzhou**</p>
<p>After the Wenzhou Defense Commander, acting on orders, notified on the 23rd of last month to temporarily prohibit foreign vessels from entering and leaving the Ou River, the loophole in the Ou River blockade had not yet been closed. Now, with the approval of Commander-in-Chief Liu via telegram to resume navigation to Wenzhou, in order to facilitate travel and promote cargo transport, foreign shipping companies, upon receiving the notice, immediately prepared to dispatch vessels to resume navigation to Wenzhou. The "Moufou" vessel of the German-Lihe Shipping Company, originally scheduled to clear customs yesterday and sail to Wenzhou this morning, has now temporarily changed its schedule to depart directly from Shanghai to Wenzhou tomorrow morning (the 6th).</p>
<p>**Gao Dengwei and Jin Escorted to Shanghai**</p>
<p>The "Gaodeng" vessel of the German Lulin Shipping Company, which operates on the Ningbo-Dinghai line, was detained by a Japanese warship in the Chuanshan waters on the 20th of last month after sailing from Dinghai to Ningbo. The Shanghai company had previously declared that the vessel had been released and berthed in Dinghai. However, according to confirmed information obtained by a reporter from the Xinxin News Agency, the "Gaodeng" vessel, under the surveillance of a Japanese warship, entered Wusongkou at around 7:00 AM yesterday and berthed at buoy No. 22 in Yangshupu. At the same time, the "Weijin" vessel of the German Hengshi Shipping Company, which operates on the Shanghai-Xinghua line, was detained in the Haimen waters of eastern Zhejiang and also escorted to Shanghai. Both vessels had Japanese flags hoisted on their masts. The "Gaodeng" vessel carried 73 passengers, and the "Weijin" vessel carried 12 passengers. All were released at 4:00 PM yesterday and sent to the New Customs Wharf by small steamers dispatched by the Japanese side. Both companies have reported the incident to the German Consulate, seeking negotiations with the Japanese side for their release. According to a passenger on the "Gaodeng" vessel who spoke to a reporter from the Xinxin News Agency, when the "Gaodeng" vessel sailed to the Chuanshan waters at around 10:00 AM on the 30th, it was searched by a Japanese warship. A young passenger in his twenties, wearing military attire, was detained by the Japanese army and transported to Shanghai by the Japanese warship.</p>
<h3>Refusal of Consular Body Against Paying Customs Duties with Counterfeit Currency</h3>
<p>Rumor Says Customs Will Promulgate Regulations for the Use of Counterfeit Currency, but the American Chamber of Commerce Denies This Statement</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, it was learned from reliable sources last night (the 3rd) that negotiations are currently underway regarding the use of newly issued counterfeit currency to pay customs duties. This is a prelude to a major national controversy. It is revealed that the local Japanese authorities are exerting great pressure on relevant agencies, forcing customs to immediately use the currency of the Huaxing Commercial Bank, which is under Japanese control. However, it is heard that the consular body here is currently making</p>
<p>A Strong Opposition</p>
<p>A customs official acknowledged this matter yesterday. However, a well-known paper importer told a reporter that his customs broker had notified him in advance to immediately obtain the new counterfeit currency to pay his customs duties. The reporter further questioned other customs brokers, who stated that customs had not issued a formal notice, but they had received "verbal notice" that "in the near future," regulations regarding the use of</p>
<p>Counterfeit Currency Regulations</p>
<p>will be promulgated. Personnel from the American Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. Commercial Counselor's Office also stated that they were unaware of this alleged action to be taken by customs. The so-called Huaxing Bank was officially established by the Japanese organizers and the Nanjing puppet regime on May 1st. Photos of the new counterfeit currency have been distributed in this port by Japanese photography companies, but the counterfeit currency</p>
<p>Has Not Yet Circulated</p>
<p>According to a statement issued by the Japanese who instigated the establishment of this new counterfeit institution, the bank's currency will be backed by legal tender. According to foreign banking circles in this port, the bank's purpose is to conspire to undermine the stability of the currency used as collateral. Furthermore, the English-language "Great American Evening News" stated that the claim in a certain morning newspaper that negotiations were underway regarding the use of the new "Hongkou currency" to pay customs duties could not be confirmed by the Shanghai Customs authorities, but</p>
<p>Customs Authorities</p>
<p>did not immediately deny this claim. Even if there are currently no negotiations regarding this matter, there is no doubt that the Japanese will use all their influence in the Jianghai Customs to ensure that customs at least accept the "Hongkou" currency as customs duties for Japanese foreign trade.</p>
<h3>Local Authorities Exert Efforts in Disaster Relief and Both Ningbo and Shaoxing Are Tranquil</h3>
<p>Order Is Being Restored in the Ningbo Area, Banks and Money Shops Switch to Evening Business Hours</p>
<p>The urban area of Ningbo near Ling Bridge was bombed by Japanese aircraft three times on the 29th of last month and the 1st and 2nd of this month. The details have been reported in previous newspapers (the "Ningbo Bombed Again" news reported by this newspaper yesterday was the situation of the bombing on the 2nd). The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai received telegrams from the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce and private individuals on the 1st and 2nd of this month, but there was no news on the 3rd and 4th, which caused considerable anxiety. Fellow villagers in Shanghai rushed to the association to inquire about the situation. Now, it is learned that the association managed to inquire about the truth of the situation in Ningbo via telegram yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Evacuate the population, business hours in the evening</p>
<p>A New Voice News Agency reporter learned from the shipping industry yesterday that the urban areas of Ningbo and Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang have been bombed by Japanese aircraft repeatedly. The Ningbo and Wenzhou-Taizhou defense commanders have ordered the evacuation of the urban population, and businesses have switched to evening business hours to avoid daytime bombing. The notice from the Ningbo Banking and Money Exchange Association is recorded as follows: "All members (banks) (money shops) will change their business hours from April 29th to 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM daily. Sundays will be closed as usual. This is a special notice. Please be informed."</p>
<p>Ningbo and Shaoxing are as peaceful as usual</p>
<p>In the past two days, rumors have been rife in Shanghai that war has broken out in Ningbo and that Shaoxing has been bombed by Japanese aircraft. Therefore, fellow villagers from Ningbo and Shaoxing in Shanghai have been inquiring with various fellow villagers organizations and shipping companies. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from relevant parties yesterday that a certain shipping company in Shanghai had communicated with Ningbo by telegram and learned that after Ningbo was bombed repeatedly, fortunately, the local authorities exerted efforts in disaster relief and handled the aftermath. Local order has been completely restored and is as peaceful as usual. As for the claim that Shaoxing was bombed, the telegram did not mention it, which is enough to prove that the bombing is unreliable. It is also heard that heavy troops have been stationed in the coastal area of eastern Zhejiang, with strict precautions. There are definitely no problems with the defense.</p>
<h3>Foreigners from Hankou After Arriving in Shanghai, Straight Out of Prison Get Released</h3>
<p>Claiming that Freedom of Movement has been Lost in Hankou, the Suffering of the Chinese is Beyond Description</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, the British warship "Scorpion," carrying 43 foreigners from Hankou, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 3rd) afternoon. Their relatives and friends gathered at the wharf on the Bund of the French Concession to meet them. At about 4:00 PM, the warship berthed, and the foreigners disembarked one after another. According to a certain British expatriate among them, this arrival in Shanghai is like the release of prisoners. Others who described the situation in Hankou said that since residing in Hankou, they could not bear to stay any longer. The</p>
<p>Freedom of Movement</p>
<p>of foreigners and Chinese is still strictly restricted. Passports must be carried at all times. The Japanese treat foreigners of any nationality without much difference, but the treatment of Chinese is far from satisfactory. Outside of Hankou, in a state of chaos, farmers are robbed by the Japanese army and bandits, and their suffering is beyond description. Only farmers living far away from the Japanese military area and completely under the jurisdiction of the guerrillas,</p>
<p>Can Be Safe</p>
<p>It is said that ten foreigners from Hankou arrived on the British "Cricket" warship one hour after the "Scorpion" berthed. The "Cricket" has now completed its final service and will soon be dismantled.</p>

<h3>Rice Industry Meeting Today to Discuss Limiting Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Hoping to Share the Burden of Difficulties and Maintain the People's Food Supply</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Concerned About the Livelihood of Civilians</p>
<p>The Public Concession Bureau of Public Works, in light of the fact that rice market transactions have suddenly exceeded the price limit in recent days, has attached great importance to the matter. They dispatched personnel to various groups yesterday to inquire about everything, hoping to assist in the food supply of the concession and maintain the status quo. Rice industry groups in this city have scheduled a joint meeting at 3:00 PM today to properly discuss solutions. The market situation yesterday morning was relatively stable, with a slight decrease in the number of transactions and a slight decrease in off-market prices. However, the publicly quoted price of the highest quality white japonica rice reached 15 yuan. Details of the situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Concerned About the People's Food Supply</p>
<p>The Bureau of Public Works of the Shanghai Public Concession and the Bureau of Directors of the French Concession are quite satisfied with the efforts of various rice industry groups to automatically limit market prices, investigate grain reserves, and dredge supply sources. They sent letters expressing their appreciation. However, in recent days, in view of the sudden increase in rice prices again, the buying and selling prices in the market have exceeded the price limit by more than one yuan. This phenomenon does not seem to benefit the citizens and is of great concern. They specifically dispatched personnel to groups such as the Bean and Rice Industry Association yesterday to inquire about the situation and verbally urged the leaders of each industry to quickly advise merchants to assist in the food supply of the concession and the livelihood of the poor, and to impose restrictions.</p>
<p>Rice Industry Joint Meeting to Discuss Solutions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association will hold a joint meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon at the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange on 3rd floor, Rue Edouard VII, inviting the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association, Rice Milling Association, Changshu Rice Industry Association, Southern Helping Association, Rice Grain Merchants Association, and Rice Transporters Association to discuss important issues such as rice prices in Shanghai and dredging rice grain sources. All opinions put forward by merchants from various guilds have been reported by the Market Management Committee, and the recommendations of the Price Evaluation Committee have also been submitted to the joint meeting for detailed discussion to discuss proper solutions together.</p>
<p>Rice Grain Prices Reach 15 Yuan</p>
<p>From May 1st to 3rd, transactions in the rice industry market suddenly soared, even to the extent that the publicly quoted price of the highest quality white keng scented rice reached 15 yuan per stone. In addition, both buyers and sellers are engaged in off-market transactions at 400 to 500 coppers per stone. The number of transactions also increased dramatically, and the market was unprecedentedly turbulent. By the time the market opened yesterday morning, the situation had eased slightly, and off-market transactions had gradually subsided, not as sharp as in the past one or two days. The number of transactions opened up was limited, but the highest quality white keng scented rice still reached 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Confirmation of the "Xinsheng" Vessel Being Detained and Forced to Sail to Taiwan</h3>
<p>Negotiations by the Norwegian Consul General Are Still Ineffective</p>
<p>After the Norwegian vessel "Gong Sheng," represented by the Xinchang'an Company, and the Norwegian vessel "Baode," represented by the Taiping Shipping Company, were successively detained by Japanese warships and forced to sail to Taiwan, although the Norwegian Consul General in Shanghai protested to Japan, he was still unable to obtain the release of the vessels by the Japanese side. Now, it has been confirmed that the Norwegian vessel "Xinsheng," represented by the Fuan Company, which went missing after sailing from Shantou to Hong Kong on the 26th of last month, was detained by a Japanese warship outside Shantou and forced to sail to Taiwan. The agent notified the Cissen Company in Hong Kong and reported to the Norwegian Consul in Hong Kong, requesting negotiations with the Japanese side and requesting a speedy release.</p>
<h3>Marshal Joffre Vessel Arrives in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>The French postal vessel "Marshal Joffre" was damaged in a collision with the Great British Company's "Guangdong" vessel, which resulted in a lengthy stay in Hong Kong for repairs. It is now learned that the "Joffre" has left the dock and is coming to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive in port at 1:00 PM today and berth at the Lao Ning Shao Wharf. It will carry 153 passengers and 90 bags of mail. It will stay in Shanghai for five days and is scheduled to depart on May 9th via Hong Kong, Saigon, Singapore, and Colombo, bound for Marseille, France.</p>
<h3>The Hog Industry Balances Meat Prices</h3>
<p>The Maximum Price Must Not Exceed the Limits of the Public Resolution. Slaughterhouses Refuse to Slaughter Pigs from Unknown Sources.</p>
<p>The Fresh Pig Industry Association, after deciding on four measures to resolutely deal with the plundered fresh pigs, has caused the arrival of goods to decrease sharply and meat prices to soar. Yesterday, it issued a special notice to balance prices in order to maintain the people's food supply. The slaughterhouses in both concessions have refused pigs from unknown sources. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Balance Market Prices</p>
<p>The industry association issued a notice yesterday balancing market prices, which stated, "For the purpose of notification, it has been found that the goods of this industry have recently been intercepted by the 'Livestock Market' in Hongkou, causing transporters to be discouraged and the source of goods to be lacking. If market prices are arbitrarily raised as a result, it would not be the intention of this industry to maintain meat food. Market prices should be balanced, and the highest price should not exceed the limits set by public resolution, in order to maintain the fairness of the trade in this industry and to care for the people's food. It is hoped that all businesses will share this intention and cooperate in handling this matter. This is the most important thing. This is a special notice."</p>
<p>Sharp Decline in Arrivals</p>
<p>A New Voice News Agency reporter learned from the fresh pig industry yesterday that only 52 pigs were loaded on the Tonghe vessel on the 3rd to meet the needs of the entire city, which is almost equal to zero. On the 4th, only 112 pigs were loaded on the Ruikang vessel, 342 pigs were loaded on the Hengxi vessel, and 377 necks of pigs were loaded on the Japanese Wanli Maru vessel. The total was only 800 pigs. The reason for this is that the goods arriving in Shanghai are often detained, and the goods are not controlled by the owners. Everyone is unwilling to sacrifice their capital for no reason. Therefore, the disruption of fresh meat in this city is caused by those who have repeatedly intercepted it.</p>
<p>Refusal to Slaughter</p>
<p>Slaughterhouses in both concessions have refused to accept pigs transported and slaughtered in the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou. For example, on May 3rd, several truckloads of pigs were transported to slaughterhouses in both concessions for slaughter. The slaughterhouses refused to accept them for slaughter because the source of the pigs was unknown. Also, the eight trainloads of pigs that were previously detained, totaling more than 400 pigs, were said to be returned on the night of the 3rd, but as of 5:00 PM on the 4th, they had not been returned. The reason given was that the prepayment of fees was rejected by the cargo owner, so the matter has not been resolved.</p>
<h3>Cai Renbao Resigns from Disaster Relief Post and the Authorities Persuade Him to Stay</h3>
<p>Some Staff Unjustifiably Criticized Him, and the Authorities Are Determined Not to Let Him Withdraw</p>
<p>The person in charge of the refugee camps sponsored by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association is Mr. Cai Renbao, director of the association's office and general manager of the refugee camps. Mr. Cai is shrewd, decisive, and courageous in taking on tasks. Especially for the No. 1 refugee camp at the end of Datong Road and Dunning Road, his</p>
<p>Outstanding Achievements</p>
<p>Since its opening, which was only four months ago, he has carefully planned all the essential aspects of internal accommodation and management facilities and has done so in an orderly manner. For example, preparing children's education, training the skills of refugees, engaging in production, paying attention to fire prevention, and emphasizing hygiene and preventing diseases, etc. He has even set up a broadcasting room and entertainment room to regulate the spirit of the refugees and relieve their depression. All of these have been implemented without sparing any effort. In addition, the eight precepts he has personally set, such as not being partial, not protecting, not being selfish, not engaging in malfeasance, not drinking alcohol, not smoking, not gambling, and not fighting, can be practiced by him personally and serve as a model for all staff and refugees in the camp. Therefore, his staff and refugees can abide by the law and are able to see the subtle effects of the upper class leading the lower class and responding quickly to influence. Since the outbreak of the war, refugees in Shanghai have been as numerous as ants, and refugee camps throughout Shanghai have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, providing for the needs of this extraordinary period. If you want to find one that is second to none and is a model for all refugee camps, then it must be this one.</p>
<p>Reasons for Resignation</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, just as the camp was making steady progress, it was suddenly heard that Mr. Cai had the intention of retiring and had already expressed his resignation to the highest authorities of the association. The news spread, not only shocking the staff and refugees of the camp, but also surprising people in the community. A reporter specifically went to investigate the reasons for Mr. Cai's decision to resign yesterday and learned that the main reason was that some staff members were picking on small things and making unwarranted criticisms. Mr. Cai was leading the staff and working hard on the camp's affairs when he suddenly suffered this unexpected and unreasonable blow. The enthusiasm in his heart was greatly reduced. The so-called troublemakers were pulling his legs from behind. Mr. Cai felt that he was fulfilling his obligations entirely for the sake of society, but he was still facing this adversity. Therefore, in a fit of anger, he resolutely retired.</p>
<p>Sincere Retention</p>
<p>It is heard that all the staff members of the refugee camp have written to Mr. Cai, sincerely retaining him. It is also heard that the highest authorities of the association, Chairman Yu Qiaqing and Secretary-General Yuan Ludeng, and all the important committee members, attach great importance to Mr. Cai and are determined not to let him withdraw. They have strongly advised him to dispel his intention to resign. In addition, Mao Heyuan, a member of the Relief Committee, visited the Dunning Road refugee camp on the 2nd of this month and believes that the camp's various implementations were well-planned and that it was fortunate that someone was in charge. It is still necessary to continue to promote them. He also strongly advised Mr. Cai not to develop any intention to retire. After this strong retention, Mr. Cai may be able to change his mind and not be so determined to withdraw.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government Will Continue to Issue Public Bonds for Many Years to Come</h3>
<p>At Least 20 Billion Yuan Will Be Issued Annually, or 50 Billion Yuan Is Possible</p>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening News" stated that the Japanese Minister of Finance, Ishiwata, declared at a meeting in Tokyo that even if the war in China could end in the near future, the Tokyo government would have to issue deficit bonds of at least 20 billion yen annually for many years to come. If the Sino-Japanese war continues to continue, the deficit issued by Japan</p>
<p>Will Inevitably Increase</p>
<p>to more than 40 billion yuan annually, or even 50 billion yuan is possible. The deficit in the Japanese budget continues to increase. It was found that in the first month of this year, the Japanese government's revenue was 225 million yuan less than its expenditures. The deficit for February of this year increased to 270 million yuan, the deficit for March increased to 310 million yuan, and the deficit for April is estimated by the</p>
<p>Bank of Japan</p>
<p>to be 480 million yuan. Therefore, the deficit for the first four months of this year has reached 1.285 billion yuan. During the same period, the new public bonds issued by the Sino-Japanese government exceeded this deficit, totaling 1.13 billion yuan. Japanese official reports claim that these public bonds have been fully absorbed, but in reality, the amount of these public bonds purchased by the Japanese public is</p>
<p>Less than Before</p>
<p>Forty-three percent of the new public bonds were taken over by the savings department of the Ministry of Finance, which forced Japanese savings banks to absorb them. The rest was taken over by the Bank of Japan, but it had no choice but to transfer a large portion of the new public bonds to other banks to absorb. As for individuals, there is little concern shown for increasing investment in national bonds.</p>
<h3>Lin Kanghou, Jiang Yiping, and Others Mediate Trademark Dispute</h3>
<p>"For the treatment of gonorrhea, new medicines are emerging every day. Recently, Guanghua Pharmaceutical Factory has issued a bacterial preparation for internal use to treat gonorrhea, called '1919 Gonococcus Vaccine,' which is manufactured under the supervision of the Shanghai Special Zone Health Laboratory. After its release, because buyers can enjoy free inspection rights and because the drug is quite effective, the three-day special price attracted many buyers. However, the '919' trademark used by Guanghua was jointly registered earlier by Zhongfa Pharmacy when it released 914. Therefore, after Guanghua published the advertisement, Zhongfa immediately raised an objection, and a dispute arose between the two parties, which threatened to escalate. In the middle, Lin Kanghou, Jiang Yiping, Yuan Hesong, Tu Kaiwei, Gao Peiliang, and Zhu Yuquan took on the task of mediation and, from a friendly standpoint, traveled between the two parties to reconcile. The principals of Guanghua and Zhongfa also expressed their understanding and were willing to respect the opinions of the mediators. It was decided that Guanghua would change the name of Gonococcus Vaccine to '161' for future distribution. Thus, a dispute came to an end, and peace was restored."</p>
<h3>Refugee Product Exhibition Opens This Morning</h3>
<p>Set a Schedule for All Sectors to Visit, Set Up a Sales Department to Welcome Purchases</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Branch has been promoting refugee production work for a long time. Now, in order to observe the production results, a refugee product exhibition is held. The venue is located in the No. 1 Refugee Camp in the Qianye Guild Hall on North Henan Road, Wenjianshi Road. The opening is scheduled for this morning.

<h3>Wang Hongzhu, a Japanese Military Agent in Suzhou, Was Shot Dead</h3>
<p>While Sipping Tea in the Xuyuan Teahouse, He Was Suddenly Attacked by Two People with Guns.</p>
<p>According to a person from Suzhou who came to Shanghai, Wang Hongzhu, a native of Wuxi, was 34 years old (originally named Liu Zhongquan, he married into the Wang family). Before the August 13th Incident, he worked in a silk factory outside Panmen, Suzhou, for more than ten years. Due to commercial contacts, he developed a close relationship with the Japanese side. When Suzhou was about to fall, he immediately joined the Inoue Unit of the Japanese Army as an interpreter, extorting money everywhere and setting up "comfort women stations" in the city. Therefore, he was extremely favored by Inoue, who appointed him as a special agent and secret detective. After accepting the puppet "order," Wang became even more unscrupulous, framing good people. Several guerrillas were also sacrificed because he reported them to the Japanese army. Therefore, the guerrillas had long wanted to kill Wang to eliminate harm to the country. On the morning of the day before yesterday (the 2nd), Wang was sipping tea alone in the Xuyuan Teahouse in Yangyu Lane when he was suddenly attacked by two people with guns. Wang was shot dead on the spot, and the attackers calmly escaped. The order was chaotic for a while. After hearing the alarm, the Japanese garrison immediately sent a large number of Japanese soldiers to suppress the situation. On the one hand, they paid 300 yuan to "comfort" the family of the deceased and hastily collected Wang's body. Since this incident occurred, a state of tension has suddenly reappeared in Suzhou. The Japanese and puppet forces are uneasy.</p>

They were received and Yu agreed to mediate. The manufacturers' group, represented by Zhang Mulian, petitioned Ai Ludeng of the Taxpayers' Association, who also agreed to seek special accommodation from the authorities.

A telegram was sent to the Chongqing headquarters, urging Yu Hede, the chairman of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, to dissuade the relocation nearby. A letter was also sent to Fei Xindun, the General Manager of the Public Works Department, to notify the Water Company to temporarily suspend water supply to avoid disorder. The three thousand tenants of the Qing Yu Li also appointed representatives, Zhou Xiang Sheng and thirty others, to petition the First Special District Court. Furthermore, the Shanghai Women's Commercial &amp; Savings Bank also issued a statement regarding this case, stating briefly that the bank leased all the land and buildings of Qing Yu Li, New Chongqing Road, owned by the Poor Children's Education Institute on November 6, 1933, and signed a lease, which was filed under Non-Character No. 101 in the First Special District Local Court.

<h3>Sausage Industry Association Establishes Preparatory Committee</h3>
<p>The Shanghai pig and sheep casing industry occupies an important position as an export commodity. German, British, French, American, and Russian merchants have established factories in Shanghai to purchase casings. Except for a few foreigners, the rest are Chinese. There is usually a lack of liaison organizations, so public welfare undertakings such as schools, orphan care, material assistance, medical care, and disaster relief cannot be carried out. Now, Wang Zhi Zheng, the owner of Yi Xing Intestine Factory, together with colleagues in the industry, initiated the Shanghai Sausage Industry Association. No matter whether Chinese or foreign factories, owners, or partners, all can join the association. The other day, a meeting of colleagues in the industry was convened, and many people attended. It was resolved on the spot to establish a preparatory committee and elect Wang Zhi Zheng and four others as members of the preparatory committee, and Wang Zhi Zheng was elected as chairman of the association.

<h3>Min Yi Pharmaceutical Factory, Enthusiastic Subscription by All Circles</h3>
<p>Since the Min Yi Pharmaceutical Factory publicly offered shares, subscriptions from all circles have been very enthusiastic.

As a result, the number of people requesting charters and subscribing for shares has been very large recently. The preparation office of the pharmaceutical factory is located inside the Zhongxi Pharmacy on Fourth Malu Road.</p>
<h3>Japanese Free Action, Arresting Three Russians, Reason Unknown, Two Released</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that a Russian was arrested by the Japanese army in Shanghai five weeks ago and is still being detained. Two other Russians were also arrested, but were released after being arrested for a month. There is no clear reason for the arrest of the three. It was found that the Japanese army arrested them on March 29 in a house on Yangshupu Road and押赴 百老滙大厦 (translated as "Broadway Building"). The Japanese army did not ask the police for cooperation, but acted freely in the Public Concession. The three Russians were Boris Sofovsky, the Sige of the Chinese Timber Import and Export Company (translated meaning) on Yangshupu Road, Korinichu, an employee of a certain company, and Siglov, who was unemployed. Mr. Xi is still being detained. Bao and Ke were released on April 28. It is said that Ruoju did not know why he was arrested. The Japanese army treated him well and was interrogated. The question was about their political intentions. The Japanese army arrested them because they had obtained some mysterious information from the Japanese Consulate. In the past few days, rumors about these three Russians have spread in Shanghai, saying that they were allowed by the Pudong guerrillas to land on the property they were guarding, so they were arrested by the Japanese army. This statement seems to be purely nonsense. The only explanation is that someone held a grudge against them and fabricated information to the Japanese Consul-General, who told the Japanese army, who arrested them without notifying the工部局.</p>

<h3>Students in Sichuan</h3>
<p>— New Dream</p>
<p>Life is simple, like monks in a monastery. From sunrise to sunset, they work tirelessly. Not afraid of bombing, they have built their own air-raid shelters. Classes are called by bugle, filling the atmosphere with a military spirit.</p>
<p>Half of China's educational institutions have been destroyed by Japanese bombs, and are now in ruins. The remaining buildings have been occupied by Japanese troops. The books and equipment that remain have either been looted or burned.</p>
<p>They have destroyed universities and higher schools, but Chinese education is progressing, and the government and those who promote education are working harder than ever before.</p>
<p>"When I saw Japanese bombs destroy our campus like falling rain," said President Jia Lun of Central University to foreign reporters, "I vowed that for every school building they destroyed, we would build two; for every hour they killed, we would produce more than ten. This is our answer to Japan's destruction of our universities."</p>
<p>This indomitable spirit has been demonstrated by the Animal Husbandry Department of Central University, spreading throughout the country and slowly moving inland. Teams of cattle, sheep, and pigs were driven inland, traversing hundreds of miles, and finally arrived at their intended destination after a year, without losing a single animal.</p>
<p>Central University spent forty-two days building a new campus on the outskirts of Chongqing. The entire structure consists of more than fifty houses, arranged to accommodate the three thousand students and faculty who moved from Nanjing to the interior.</p>
<p>The school buildings and dormitories are built on the slopes of the mountains beside the Jialing River. They are rough wooden houses, but simple and clean. Students adapt to their surroundings, living a frugal and simple life. It is said that each student spends no more than two hundred and fifty yuan per year.</p>
<p>Students without money - refugees from the war zone - do not have to worry about tuition fees. The clever ones have scholarship amounts, and others can receive a monthly loan of eight yuan, six yuan for food, and two yuan for miscellaneous expenses - all they need.</p>
<p>A thousand students can dine in a cafeteria, with two sets of rough bowls and plates, and large buckets filled with steamed rice placed in the aisles of the dining hall. The simple life of these young students is comparable to that of monks living in a monastery.</p>
<p>However, life at the university is very peaceful, and students work tirelessly from sunrise to sunset. In small factories, they work with machines and tools snatched back from the Japanese. In the art room, some students are painting propaganda murals. Colorful and vivid pictures hang on the walls, serving as decorations for the studio. At the foot of Songshan (translator), new houses are being built quickly, which is the new campus of Central University, preparing to accommodate more new students next semester.</p>
<p>According to the Chinese government's external claims: Since the outbreak of the war, it has spent five million yuan to relieve 55,000 students, 15,000 university professors, teachers, and educators who have lost their jobs due to the war. According to the latest news released by the Ministry of Education: Among the higher schools destroyed by Japan in the war zone, 53 have been moved to the interior, part of the schools have been moved to the interior are 17, in addition, there are two schools that are moving to the interior, and eight are still active in the Japanese-occupied areas.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Ministry of Education also announced that since the outbreak of the war, five new universities and technical schools have been added in the interior; before the war, there were only eight higher schools in those places. Now Sichuan, among the inland provinces, has the largest number of schools moving from the war zone.</p>
<p>Like Central University, Tianjin's Nankai University also moved to the interior. However, the principal of the school, Zhang Boqin, and his colleagues, had a more distant vision than other educators, they had already seen when Japan invaded North China. In 1936, a year before the Lugou Bridge Incident, a new campus had already been selected.</p>
<p>Construction work also began with a funding of five hundred thousand yuan, of which fifty thousand yuan was donated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. A year later, the war broke out, and their school was completely destroyed by Japanese incendiary bombs, they traveled a thousand miles to Sichuan. Now there are one thousand and four hundred students studying at Nankai, two-thirds of whom fled from the war zone, and they have witnessed their schools and homes destroyed by the Japanese. These male and female students are extremely patriotic and are able to fulfill their duties for the welfare of the country. During the recent donation competition, these young citizens took out 17,000 yuan from their own pockets to contribute to the country.</p>
<p>The exterior of the entire campus looks like a military camp, and every student, regardless of gender, wears a uniform. Female students in uniform are rigorously drilled on the playground. Male students in military uniforms gather together and are taught by an officer how to fire Chinese-made machine guns. Others play basketball and football on the large playground. The bugle replaces the bronze bell to call students into the classroom, making the atmosphere of this school even more filled with military spirit.</p>
<p>Although Central University and Nankai are far from the city, they are not afraid of Japanese planes bombing, and both schools have built their own air-raid shelters. At Nankai, they even have their own alarm. Japanese planes used to bomb their original school, leaving a deep impression on the students. Young people are enthusiastically fond of aviation, and most study aviation subjects. Among the Chinese Air Force, sixty aviators were formerly graduates of Nankai.</p>
<p>"When China sees peace again," said President Luo, "we will return to Nanjing." But all these universities and higher schools must remain in the interior. China's educational institutions will be twice as many as before the Sino-Japanese war.</p>

<h3>Bombing</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>The people who are fighting in the war are naturally not afraid of airplanes and bombs, but the people who are most afraid of airplanes and bombs are civilians, and they have to bomb our civilians. I don't know what hatred they have with our people! To resort to such inhuman means?</p>
<p>Many of their soldiers have amulets from certain shrines around them. I guess their meaning is nothing more than to ask the gods to bless them. I don't know if the gods are willing to protect these cruel soldiers. There are still problems in between.</p>
<p>Assuming that the gods are truly effective, I think there must be those who will be punished by them.</p>
<h3>Impressions of "[Female Warriors]"</h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>The First Soviet Color Film Opens at the Shanghai Guangda Theater</p>
<p>It was "A Life of One's Own" that laid the foundation for Soviet films in front of Chinese audiences. That's not because "A Life of One's Own" was the first film to open in China, but because of its grand and broad style; this style would have influenced Hollywood, and the Chinese film industry, which was in its infancy, was even more affected.</p>
<p>Now it is Aik Yagnukovich's first film after A Life of One's Own, "The Nightingale Song" (now translated as "Female Warriors") has come to China; like "A Life of One's Own" as the first sound film in the Soviet Union, this "Female Warriors" is the first color film in the Soviet Union. Although its protagonist has only red and blue colors, so that it cannot transmit all the colors of objects in layers, especially in action, the colors appear a bit blurred, but like those static pictures, such as the introduction of several landscapes and the roses in the vase, its beauty is actually not much less than that of the American technicolor film. In other scenes, such as the scene where the fire is extinguished, the raging flames and his shadow also have great achievements in photography technology.</p>
<p>The director's skills are also superior, especially the "weaving connection" in each scene. We can cite many admirable places. For example: the new factory is completed, the female workers are forced to participate in the celebration ceremony, and Grugniang presents a scene in which there is a vase with the factory owner's portrait. Aik used a close-up of the dog to represent the expression of the foreman. He used it very appropriately. Also, for example: a labor strike breaks out, and it is assumed that Grugniang goes to the roof to send a signal. Grugniang is shot in the arm, struggling to bandage the wound with a headscarf, and the blood comes out and dyes the headscarf red. When she arrives at the roof, she uses this blood flag as a writing signal. This cleverness is also admirable, and the gradual increase of the blood stains after being shot is much more real and powerful than the close-up of a large pile of blood after being shot in general Hollywood movies; also, the enjoyable scene of the female workers attacking with porcelain, whether it is in the country or its atmosphere, is definitely not comparable to an American movie. We can cite many similar examples, but for the sake of space, we can only omit them.</p>
<p>The story of "Female Warriors" is a historical fact from 1910 to 1921 during the "eve of the revolution. This is one of many heroic revolutionary labor strikes. Although there is a little modification, it is still very real in general.</p>
<p>The meaning of this film in the Soviet Union and in China is certainly different. So, what will it make us get when it opens here at this time? That is to say, what is its objective effect?</p>
<p>A friend said to me after seeing those queens being forced to wear new clothes (the fabric was pre-issued, and the cost was deducted from the salary) singing and presenting vases to celebrate the completion of the new factory, that this reminded him of the "celebratory style" brought by certain "funny characters"; however, what moved me more was the heroic female workers' decision to use the porcelain on their hands as a weapon of attack, and the pilot's use of his unparalleled courage to send the gendarmes on the "road of no return." This is a lesson of blood, and also a living textbook, even if they have no weapons, the brave masses with consistent steps, using the tools in their hands, will eventually defeat their enemies!</p>
<p>Ivanseiva's singing voice is better than her acting skills, and she is better at acting in joyful scenes than in sad scenes. Adarov, who plays the factory owner, and Ke Kogov, who plays the foreman, have good results, especially Adarov. He performed very commendably in the scene where the new factory was completed.</p>
<p>Dare to introduce this Soviet color film to dear readers, not only because this is the first Soviet color film, which can be used as a lesson for those who are interested in film art, but mainly for the living lessons here.</p>
<p>The newsreel "Jewish Autonomous Region" before the feature film is also worth seeing.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Bearing Sorrow and Suffering, Tears Sprinkled in All Directions, Practicing Thrift and Labor, Hard Work in Ten Acres</p>
<p>At that time, there will be so many people from all over the world who come to China. To see how far China has progressed, but we can't travel all over China at once, we can show them movies. So at that time, we will also build a large cinema in the world sports meeting hall. But those are all things for next year, and this year is already starting to brew up. Today, the newsreels being shown at Soochow University are mostly about academics. There are also a few landscape films, all of which are in color. There have been quite a few short films about public welfare undertakings recently. Even the nursery that Zhu Ai and others set up, because of the three little angels, many film companies want to ask for the movie to be taken. But Dr. Lao Zhang didn't want to publicize it. They all declined them. Even so, the newsreel to be sent to the New York World's Fair will praise the success of China's nursery undertakings, and because of these triplets, I am afraid that they will still come to take pictures. The director of the Central Film Bureau has already asked Dr. Lao Zhang, and they are now in contact. In addition, Dr. Lao Zhang has many friends in the United States, and they all want to see the results of this nursery, and Dr. Lao Zhang can't refuse, right? At this moment, the two sisters Wu Junsu are accompanying Zhu Ai, Jin Danyu, and the two sisters He, etc., and after they have finished their meal, they come to the theater. The theater is already full of people, and at 7:45, the newsreel will be shown first. After about an hour, take a short break, and then the drama begins. First, a director, Mr. Yu, walked to the front of the stage and said a few humble words. The general idea is: There are many improper and imperfect places in the play, and I ask you to give your advice so that it can be improved. This director, Mr. Yu, is also a veteran in the drama world. He is now only in his forties, and in his youth, he really suffered a lot to arouse the people to engage in the Anti-Japanese War. At that time, he was also a film worker. China's film industry before the war was really very immature. Anyone who has acted in a movie in the film industry and is slightly famous is called a movie star. Especially female actors, as long as they appear on the screen, they are a movie star. At that time, although Mr. Yu was a male actor, he was also called a star. The country they were non-existent were all ambitious young people, in addition to movies, they also acted in dramas. On the eve of August 13, 1937, they were performing a highly inflammatory drama called "Defend Lugou Bridge," but they did not expect that tomorrow Shanghai would launch a louder cannon sound than Lugou Bridge.

<h3>Those Who Gain the Dao Receive Much Help</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>The international vertical and horizontal maps are based on interests, and will not be confined to morality. However, justice is in the hearts of the people, and the influence of morality does exist: for countries with the Dao, if it is beneficial to themselves, they will of course do their best to help them, even if it is not beneficial to themselves, but it is not harmful (countries with the Dao are naturally not harmful to others), at least they will adhere to strict neutrality and will not kick them when they are down, or help the wicked to do evil.</p>
<p>The aid of Britain, the United States, France and the Soviet Union to China can be attributed to the former, and the fact that other countries in the world, except for one country that invaded China, do not aid China, but do not necessarily oppress China, can be attributed to the latter. There is no other reason for this, because China is an innocent victim, and an aggressor. China is fighting, struggling; China's experiences are moving and sympathetic, and China's actions are in accordance with the will of heaven and the people. In other words, China has gained the Dao: those who gain the Dao receive much help; when help is great, the world will naturally return to it! Even Germany, which breathes with the aggressor, once signed mutually beneficial commercial treaties with China. The extent of China's assistance can be seen from this point.</p>
<p>Recently, in addition to Britain's continued active assistance to China, which is often criticized by a certain party, the United States has even more explicit expressions. According to the Hawass Agency in Washington, at a sudden meeting of the National Commercial Federation of the United States, some people even said, "When necessary, we will not hesitate to resort to war." They are very willing for China to "maintain its independent sovereignty" and become their "future primary customer," so they want to protect trade with China and not be blockaded by any aggressor. They have complete sympathy for China's resistance.</p>
<p>At the same time, the remarks made by the U.S. Ambassador to China, Johnson, in San Francisco are also of great help to China. He believes that "China has abundant food and clothing, and the people's morale is extremely high," and believes that "Japanese aircraft arbitrarily bomb the centers where Chinese people live, which only makes the Chinese people's hatred of Japan increase." The Chinese people, in the environment of continuous bombing in Ningbo and Chongqing, will probably not only feel emotional when they see this kind of talk, but will be grateful! China's pain is of concern to others, and this concern comes from complete understanding and goodwill.</p>
<p>However, China can take pride in the assistance of other countries, but it cannot relax because of it. "Heaven helps those who help themselves" can be changed to "People help those who help themselves." China should continue to strive in justice and exhaust every bit of its self-help power!</p>
<h3>Fire</h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>—Memories of Breaking Through from Xuzhou—</p>
<p>Watching the unquenchable fire greedily devour Xusan Village, several old people who hadn't escaped were wailing and struggling in the sea of flames. My heart felt pierced, and I couldn't help but feel resentful.</p>
<p>"Good, burn it well, blood debts must be paid with blood debts!"</p>
<p>Night fell, and gusts of evening wind blew, making the sea of flames even more turbulent and roaring. Black smoke billowed in clumps, and the flames rose higher, licking at the sky… Even the sky seemed licked and fiery red.</p>
<p>The troops, already trapped in the enemy's encirclement, gathered outside the village, distributing the mortar shells they couldn't carry. Then, along a soft dirt road, they marched forward in a mighty formation. The yellow dust rose terribly, choking people, who coughed incessantly. The cavalry, moving alongside the队伍, stirred up a cloud of dust, rudely rushing ahead. People walked rapidly, one after another. Sometimes, when the distance between them grew too large, they broke into a run to catch up.</p>
<p>Having walked more than ten li, they looked back at Xusan Village: the sea of flames was still turbulent and roaring, frighteningly so!</p>
<p>Night enveloped the earth, and no one knew where they were. The road was so uneven, but their feet seemed to know it well, taking large strides forward.</p>
<p>We arrived at a town, no one knew what it was called, completely destroyed by enemy aircraft, and not a single civilian in sight. As they stepped over the rubble through this desolate, lifeless town, a remaining house was still emitting black smoke, but no one came to save it; the fire greedily burned on.</p>
<p>Everyone's hearts were filled with resentment, sorrow… Silently, they just walked on the endless road.</p>
<p>Ahead was a frighteningly red glow of fire, making the dark sky seem so bright and clear that some small villages, swallowed by darkness, were also clearly visible.</p>
<p>Following the road, toward that red target, they arrived beside the sea of flames, only to see another village destroyed!</p>
<p>"Ah, you insane bandits, this hatred cannot be forgotten! Your brutality will not destroy China, but will only hasten your own demise!" People walked on ceaselessly. Those overcome by sleepiness simply ran to the fields, to the side of the road, heedless of everything, and fell asleep haphazardly, but most of the troops continued to move forward.</p>
<p>It seemed endless, passing one village after another. Their aching feet felt too weak to lift, and they were desperately thirsty, but they still had to walk.</p>
<p>Day broke, and they hoped the campsite would be arriving soon. Exhausted and barely able to continue, they mustered the last of their strength and walked forward, hoping to satisfy their unbearable hunger and thirst at the campsite. But by ten o'clock, the campsite at Tuzhuang was still nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>"Alas, this is exhausting!"</p>
<p>"Walk, what else can we do but walk?"</p>
<p>The road was littered with stragglers, walking aimlessly. Arriving at Jiagou Town, they hoped at least to get a drink of water even if there was no food, but found it had already been bombed flat by enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>With disappointed hearts and dragging their limp feet, they stumbled to Jiagou Station on the Jinpu Railway. Here, a dead train was still parked, filled with goods, luggage, and two machine guns and a lot of bullets.</p>
<p>The station seemed deserted, chillingly so. As they stepped across the Jinpu Railway, just as they were about to walk forward, a fierce cannonade suddenly erupted from the top of the mountain ahead:</p>
<p>—Boom!</p>
<p>—Boom!</p>
<p>But we ignored it and continued toward our destination.</p>
<h3>Aiming (Woodcut)</h3>
<p>— Su Li</p>
<h3>Afterthoughts</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>I fully agree with Mr. Bai Ying's opinions on translation work. Indeed, there are many people engaged in translation now, but inevitably there is a lot of wasted effort and resources without a corresponding increase in efficiency. If there were a liaison organization for common discussion, I think there would certainly be much progress. I hope Mr. Bai Ying will be willing to be the initiator of this, and that all those engaged in translation will join.</p>
<h3>We are Young People</h3>
<p>— Bing Quan</p>
<p>Now, surging before my eyes are countless faces of young people, as red as fire, joyful, and pure; the backdrop to these many faces is the wide expanse of the wilderness, the domed, deep blue sky. Voices filled with vitality and enthusiastic passion are shouted from their mouths, spreading across this great field… Gradually, they all disperse, rushing like wildfire to burn in another corner, but the echo of their voices still reverberates clearly, lingering.</p>
<p>I sink into a sweet fantasy.</p>
<p>The sound of the door shatters my peaceful dream. A young person, just like me, comes in. The passionate radiance has vanished from his face, replaced by a desolate shadow of misery.</p>
<p>Neither of us speaks, silently sitting across from each other. We just listen to the sound of time's footsteps steadily fading away, far off but also seemingly very near. Finally, he opens his mouth.</p>
<p>I am sensitively thinking of other things, only seeing his lips moving vaguely up and down; but without even hearing his voice, I can understand what he is saying, because I have heard it countless times. He is telling of his pain.</p>
<p>"You are in pain, aren't you?" I say.</p>
<p>"Yes…"</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>"Aren't you the same as me?" he says agitatedly.</p>
<p>Yes, I am just as much in pain as him! We sit quietly facing each other again. But when a small spark—a spark of life—ignites deep within my heart, I break the threat of silence, leaping up suddenly:</p>
<p>"Of course, some other brothers are living a more joyful and great life than us; we are thrown into the dark wilderness. But does that mean we should despair, should we let ourselves rot away?... No, we cannot!..."</p>
<p>He is startled for a moment. He grasps my hand tightly. I see two streaks of hot tears shining in his eyes, and a rosy color quickly outlines a clear contour on his cheeks.</p>
<p>"People with life and faith will never rust in a damp, bad environment. We must fight strongly!" A clear voice rings out loudly.</p>
<h3>Talking About Translation Work</h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>—Suggestions to Translators—</p>
<p>In the Shanghai publishing industry in the past year, there has been a noteworthy phenomenon: the flourishing of translation work. Almost every newspaper and magazine has translated works. In some publications, translations account for a considerable amount in terms of both quantity and quality, and among single-volume books, translated works are probably more "bestselling" than original creations. Many newspapers even have special columns dedicated to translations.</p>
<p>If we frankly admit that China's modern culture is relatively backward, this phenomenon is a very fortunate one. Moreover, translation work is a very important and essential task for cultural exchange. Especially in today's war of resistance, it can provide us with spiritual and practical assistance (such as intelligence) in terms of foreign sympathy and opinions toward China, accurate analysis of the international situation, on-the-spot reports from foreign war correspondents and observers, and foreign-collected historical materials on the war of resistance. And the texts introduced by Shanghai translators mostly fall within the above scope.</p>
<p>Some say that translation work is simply to make clothes for others, as if anyone who understands a foreign language can easily do it. But I think translation work is not that simple. Setting aside the various technical aspects, the translator's own thoughts are a prerequisite for the practical value of their work. Merely possessing linguistic skills without a correct consciousness means that the translated work introduced cannot be correct either. Puppet newspapers and magazines also publish translations, and most of them are readable in terms of language, but they are still puppet work. Therefore, the translator's ideological problem is the prerequisite for determining the value of their translation.</p>
<p>The next point is the translator's knowledge. Although knowledge includes translation skills, knowledge is not just skills. This is especially true for translators. Other specialized technicians are also experts in the knowledge of their field, such as civil engineers and electrical engineers, whose knowledge can be specialized in the field of their skills. Translators can also specialize in literature, politics, economics, science, or other categories. However, in the current situation, translators must temporarily assume the role of Mlinister at large in the cultural world. This can be attributed to the objective needs of society and the personal life problems of translators. Therefore, current translators should strive to improve their knowledge. Like a diplomat's Minister at Iarge, even if they cannot achieve a "deep" understanding in terms of knowledge, they must at least have a certain degree of "breadth." Technical problems can also be decided on the basis of this "breadth."</p>
<p>The above two points are the most basic conditions for translators outside of linguistic skills. Currently, there are quite a few people engaged in translation work in Shanghai. In terms of ideology, judging by the principle of "resistance against Japan as the top priority," the general situation is satisfactory. However, the viewpoints are somewhat too biased. For example, the works of Snow and his wife, Smedley, Bertram, and other famous foreign writers are translated by everyone as soon as they are published. (For example, Bertram's "North China Front" is reportedly being translated by five parties.) This phenomenon has both advantages and disadvantages: on the one hand, it shows that translators have a correct perspective, but beyond the ideological perspective, there is probably also a business perspective, and the result is a waste of energy and resources. In fact, in addition to the works of established writers in China, there are many other good works, but translators lack contact, so everyone's eyes are only focused on a few famous writers, and they neglect others, even repeatedly reheating the same dish in newspapers and magazines. To correct this phenomenon, the fundamental solution is to have a liaison organization among translators. In terms of knowledge, one person is never as good as the power of the group. Even as a Minister at Iarge, one cannot be a jack of all trades. The standardization of specialized names, and the discussion of translations all require mutual research and discussion among translators.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, I cannot say everything at once. But if we acknowledge that translation work at this stage is a component of the entire war of resistance culture, then for the sake of the complete development of translation work, it is necessary for translators to establish a mutual aid organization.</p>

<h3>Four Hundred Million Compatriots Opens in America</h3>
<p>— (Chan)</p>
<p>The film "Four Hundred Million Compatriots," which recently opened in a famous New York theater, caused a sensation throughout the city of New York. It was almost sold out every show for two weeks.</p>
<p>This film records everything about China's war of resistance: life on the front lines, and the situation in the rear, all vividly captured on camera. The producer is the very experienced Joris Ivens, who three years ago gained fame for his newsreel "The Spanish Earth," and is one of the most famous newsreel photographers in America.</p>
<p>The making of this film was very difficult. In China, Joris discovered that the materials he needed were scattered everywhere. He had to travel at least eighty miles every day. In Spain, he only needed to stay in a hotel in Madrid, and upon hearing the sound of gunfire, he could set off and be on the front lines with his camera within fifteen minutes. But in China, the battlefield was so vast and distant that it often took a week to find a good piece of material. The footage of the great battle of "Recapturing Taierzhuang" was also obtained with great effort and at great risk.</p>
<p>When the film was publicly screened in New York this past March, he was invited by newspaper reporters to talk about his work and impressions. The following is an excerpt from his report:</p>
<p>'...Regarding China, many Americans only know that it is a vast and boundless land inhabited by countless hardworking people. Therefore, the first purpose of my making this film was to go deep into the interior of China and bring back some real things, so that audiences could see the true face of China, their leaders and people, and their heroic stance in this war of resistance, and sweep away the general public's superficial view of China. I can believe that my filming of this film was not a failure. Audiences will be amazed and excited after seeing the heroic battles of the Chinese people in this film, and they will overturn their old prejudices... Everything in this film is without pretense. I have recorded the truth...'</p>
<p>Incidentally, the narration for this film is performed by the famous star Fredric March.</p>

<h3>The Great Charity Sale in the Art World</h3>
<p>— Hang Chiying</p>
<p>It seems that charity work is not something that commercial artists and craft artists do. This is what most people think. Their views are based on their accumulated ideas – that commercial artists and craft artists are not related to society.</p>
<p>The Chinese Commercial and Industrial Arts Writers Association is now cooperating with all of Shanghai's Chinese painters, Western painters, sculptors, art photographers, and antique collectors to continue actively launching a great charity sale in the art world. Based on the experience of last year's winter clothing exhibition, we have improved six points in the preparation and execution of the charity sale: (1) We have extended the preparation period to a month and a half to collect more brand new art and craft items, and we are paying special attention to promoting handicrafts that should be promoted; (2) We use labels of different colors to indicate the two different natures of the products: Category A (fully donated) and Category B (half donated), which can show the donor's benevolence; (3) We try to keep the prices of the products as low as possible, so that charitable buyers are happy to participate, and the products are widely sold; (4) We do not sell tickets, and do not solicit miscellaneous donations, focusing on charity sales rather than urging purchases; (5) The collected精品 are exhibited in two batches on the 15th and 18th, so that latecomers will not be disappointed; (6) We minimize the preparation time and expenses after the opening as much as possible.</p>
<p>In addition to improving the above six points, all members of the charity sale preparatory committee, from the chairman to the secretaries of various groups, are sacrificing their professional income to contribute to the charity sale and provide voluntary services to the charity sale, mobilizing the entire group; it can be said that our artists have given as much light as they have warmth.</p>
<p>Our goal is not only to make our charity sale a success and set off a single shot; our greatest hope is that the people of Shanghai will all know their responsibilities and participate in the charity sale, so that charity sales are prevalent in every corner of the city. (Charity Donation)</p>
<h3>A Record of Wang Youchen's Spirit Delivering a Message After Death (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) The anecdotes and stories about Wang Youchen mentioned in this article are quite interesting, so we are happy to publish it. If viewed with a scientific mind, the idea of spirit delivering a message is close to superstition. Mr. Su's work is nothing more than a remembrance of an old friend, and is certainly not advocating superstition.</p>
<p>In the twenty-first year, I revisited Beiping, and Youchen and his wife invited me to their home. We ate, drank, and talked happily for several days. After that, we did not meet for another six years. Last winter night, I saw Youchen in a daze, dressed like Liu Xianzu from the camp series, as he was famous for playing this role. He said to me, "I am now entrusting a son to you. Please, for the sake of our old friendship, do not refuse." I don't remember anything else he said. When I woke up, I realized it was just a dream. I didn't know that Youchen was already dead. More than ten days later, the newspapers reported his death. He was only ill for three days and could not be saved. Then was the previous dream really Youchen's soul coming? How strange! Youchen died at the age of fifty-six. His eldest son's name is so-and-so. He studied English at a young age and entered the political world early. His youngest son studies opera and is good at playing martial roles, but his name is not very well-known. Is he the son that Youchen entrusted to me? Someday, if I have the opportunity, I will certainly live up to the expectations of my old friend in the afterlife.</p>
<p>Youchen had a beautiful appearance and was gentle like a Confucian scholar, so his performances of "Beating the Rod," "Escaping from the Box," "Cao Cao Releasing Officials," and "Empty City Stratagem" were all appropriate for his identity. He mostly performed opera about 打泡戏, and his voice was particularly good in the past. He ate 正工调, and had high, wide, and bright tones, and his 疙瘩音 was convenient, many, and large. There were some places where he was not used properly, and some people criticized him for this. I once said that Youchen's vocal cords were like the tenderest, best, and most wrinkled flute membrane. His voice was beautiful to hear, but it sounded as soon as he blew, and there was an uncontrollable trend, which was the first-class voice. He first studied with Mr. Chen Fusheng (I also studied with him and was a junior classmate, such as Shi Huibao, Meng Xiaoru, etc. were all Chen's disciples). Later, he specialized in copying Tan's tune. He sang many old tunes, covering them with Tan's style, but lacked strength in his bones. This was due to his temperament and talent, and could not be changed by human effort. Although his 字音 skills were not as good as Yu Shuyan and Yan Jupeng, his singing method adhered to the classic style and did not dare to fabricate it. If you listen to his records, you can prove that what I said is not wrong. His generosity and stability are beyond the reach of others. According to my decision, his best play was "Qionglin Banquet" first, "Empty City Stratagem" second, "Lianying Village" third, and "Bumping the Tablet" was a middle-grade play. As for "Cao Cao Releasing Officials," Youchen would always 脱板 or forget the words, and I saw him make mistakes three times. Every time Youchen made a mistake, he would call out "闹鬼儿" incessantly. This is also one of Youchen's anecdotes and jokes. If he knew in the afterlife, he would probably laugh at it.</p>

<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Reasons for the Increased Status of Actors after the Republic of China</p>
<p>(3) Su Governor Feng Guozhang invited Sun Juxian to Ning to perform a three-day charity show for disaster relief. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, Feng was appointed Su Governor, Qi Yaolin was the Provincial Governor, and Wang Guilin was the Chief of the Jiangning Police Department. Feng was from Hejian Prefecture, and Qi and Wang were both from Tianjin. In fact, Qi was from the three northeastern provinces, but since his whole family had lived in Tianjin for many years, he could also be said to be from Tianjin. Therefore, the officials and staff in the Governor's Office, the Provincial Governor's Office, and the Police Department were mostly from Zhili Province. That year, there was a flood in the province, so these fellow Zhili natives in Ning initiated a disaster relief association and sent someone to Tianjin to hire Sun Juxian, a senior member of the Pear Garden, to go south to perform charity shows for three consecutive days at the Qingle Tea Garden in Neiqiao. When the shows were announced, the words "Fellow Villagers" were written in gold letters and posted on the walls of major thoroughfares. The ticket price was specially sold for two yuan, which was a shocking innovation at that time. Old Sun was nearly seventy years old at that time. When he put on his Ning mouth, his original pale beard was exposed. However, he was energetic and walked with a generous pace, looking like he was only in his fifties. As for the program of his three days, it was "Vermilion Mole," "Xiaoyaojin," and "Fish Hiding Sword." When he sang, he was full of tunes, and his voice was magnificent. Before he took the stage on the first day, a senior official from the Governor's Office delivered a speech to the audience on behalf of Governor Feng, praising Sun's personality and art, and that his coming to Ning to perform for his hometown to raise funds for disaster relief, expressed special respect for Sun's old age, not hesitating to work hard and travel long distances. After the show, Feng, Qi, and others prepared a grand banquet to entertain him, treating him with respect, and not harboring any humble feelings because he was from the Pear Garden. When Sun returned north, many officials from various offices went to the river to see him off, and the grand occasion was like the movements of important figures. This is another clear proof of the increase in the value of actors.</p>
<p>(4) Lu Governor Zhang Zongchang held a military parade and even accompanied Cheng Yanqiu to watch it. For the Double Tenth Festival in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, General Wei Tui held a three-day celebration opera. At that time, the famous actors who came to Jinan to participate included Chang Xiaolou, Yu Shuyan, Mei Lanfang, Wang Fengqing, Shang Xiaoyun, Xun Huisheng, Gan Yanqiu, Xiao Cuihua, Li Wanchun, Wang Changlin, etc. At that time, Yanqiu was the youngest of all the female characters (only twenty-one or two years old), and his figure was not as stout as it is now. His speech was very elegant, like a young woman, so General Zhang particularly liked him. Not only did he give him generous rewards, but he also stayed close to him. The strangest thing was that during the military parade on National Day, Lao Zhang actually brought Yanqiu with him, and asked him to stand next to him. In fact, it is no different from 姊行母令. I heard that "Mysterious Lady" has been completed, and I heard that Lu Ming calls Qinfang "Mom" in the film, which is very moving to the audience.</p>
<p>Returning to Yihua After Being Overseas. In the ocean is Qian Aihua, bright eyes and white teeth, quite like the American movie star Joan Beck. She once went to sea to accompany dancing, and has recently returned to Yihua and is very busy, because she has important performances in "Three Collections of Incarnate Girl" and "Swallow Thief."</p>

<h3>Seeking to Re-Establish a Treaty</h3>
<p>(From the May issue of this newspaper, Tongzhi 11th year of the Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>China and Prussia's treaty is nearing its expiration date. The Prussian envoy has informed the Prime Minister's Office, saying, "Our nation and your esteemed dynasty have long enjoyed good relations. The treaty, written in blood, is recorded in the alliance archives. It should be observed forever, as an example to future generations. Now that the old treaty is nearing its expiration, and a new one has not yet been negotiated, how can the golden documents of our two countries remain suspended for so long?" It seems the Prussian envoy intends to re-establish a treaty with China.</p>
<h3>Chinese Laborers Being Sold Abroad</h3>
<p>There is an uninhabited island off the coast of Peru, overgrown and barren, covered in bird droppings. Because it is difficult to cultivate, Peruvians force Chinese laborers in Peru to go to the island to dig guano. The foul air is stifling, and the poisonous mist is oppressive. Within a year or so, these men are sure to die. Although it is said that they receive an extra two dollars in addition to the original eight dollars in wages, what man would go to a place of death for the sake of two dollars? Such is the plight of these Chinese laborers. As for those who traffic in "pigs" in Macau, they sell the lured people to ship owners for a price of fifty or sixty dollars per head. Once the ship owners arrive in Peru, they can earn three or four hundred dollars per person. After deducting the fifty or sixty dollars paid to the traffickers and seventy dollars for travel expenses, they can earn a net profit of over two hundred silver dollars per person. If they carry three or four hundred people, the business is quite lucrative. Therefore, they spare no effort in managing the trafficking business in Macau, and they have no conscience whatsoever. Some foolish people are willing to go, unaware of the conditions in that country and the plight of the laborers. Eight dollars in wages may not seem meager in China, but the cost of food and clothing in that country means that even those who earn twenty or thirty dollars a month cannot save any money. How much more hardship must those who receive only eight dollars endure? Moreover, upon arrival, they are forced to dig guano on the island, a truly cruel policy. This year, a coolie ship encountered a storm and docked on the coast of Japan. The coolies, aware of the inside story, jumped into the water, hoping for a chance at life. This case was thus exposed. When the truth comes to light, a strong protest should be lodged with Peru.</p>

<h3>Finance: Tianjin Port Electric Telegram, Cash Fluctuates</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash Shanghai Clearing House (烚赤) black market situation fluctuated as before. The general trend was up first, then down, and finally back up, completely controlled by supply and demand. At the opening, a certain silver house, acting on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, was buying aggressively. Other silver houses were also following suit for their clients, so the price once rose to a high of 2,119 yuan. Then, money exchange firms and securities firms, acting on behalf of the Tianjin gang, flocked to sell. A certain money exchange firm was also vying to dump, so the market trend inclined downward, once falling to a low of 2,102 yuan. Finally, the silver house gang's buying interest revived, and their money exchange firms made up for their profits, so the price gradually rose to close at 2,111 yuan. The final price increased by 2 yuan. However, there was still much fluctuation along the way, but no excessive turbulence. It is said that after closing, the Tianjin gang had new selling intentions, calling the price down to 2,109 yuan, but they still could not find a buyer, so no deal was made. Trading was brisk, about 1,050 taels. Silver ornaments rose first and then fell, resulting in no change. Customs gold remained flat. Central England pure gold and the like declined slightly.</p>
<p>Shanghai Clearing House (烚赤) Trading Still Brisk</p>
<p>Starting in the morning, each bar of ten taels. At the opening, the silver house gang, on behalf of the Hong Kong gang and other silver houses, had strong buying interest, and the market situation was quite firm. First, a certain silver house bought 50 taels from a securities firm at a starting price of 2,117 yuan, which was 8 yuan higher than the previous close. After opening, the silver house gang bought 50 taels from a certain money exchange firm at 19 yuan. Subsequently, a certain silver house also bought 100 taels from a certain money exchange firm on behalf of the Hong Kong gang at the same price. After that, the silver house gang continued to buy, but the Tianjin gang, through money exchange firms and securities firms, were relentlessly dumping, so the capital position felt oversupplied, and the price inclined downward. A money exchange firm sold 50 taels to the silver house gang at 16 yuan. Later, money exchange firms and securities firms successively sold a total of 100 taels to the silver house gang at 12 yuan each. At that time, a certain money exchange firm also joined the selling side, so the price became even more unsustainable. A certain money exchange firm sold 50 taels to the silver house gang at 10 yuan. At that time, the silver house gang stopped buying, and the sellers' selling intentions became more urgent, so the price dropped sharply by another 8 yuan. A certain money exchange firm and securities firm mutually sold 50 taels each to a certain gold shop at a price that retreated to 02 yuan. Later, the silver house gang's buying interest revived, so the price rose sharply again. A certain gold shop bought 50 taels from a securities firm at 07 yuan. The silver house gang bought 50 taels from a money exchange firm at 08 yuan, and then bought another 50 taels from a money exchange firm at 12 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop sold for profit, dumping a total of 100 taels to the silver house gang at 10 yuan each. A money exchange firm sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange firm at 08 yuan. A securities firm sold 50 taels to the silver house gang at 04 yuan. A certain money exchange firm recovered and bought 50 taels each from money exchange firms and securities firms at 05 yuan. It was already noon at that time. Later, because a certain gold shop recovered and bought, the situation became slightly firmer. First, it bought 50 taels from a money exchange firm at 07 yuan, and then bought another 50 taels from a money exchange firm, and the price jumped to 11 yuan (the seller was still the Tianjin gang dumping). After that, money exchange firms and securities firms still had selling intentions, but because gold shops and silver house gangs were all watching, although they called the price down to 09 yuan, they still could not find a buyer, so no deal was made. The evening closing price was still 2,111 yuan, which was 2 yuan higher than the closing price of the night before, a difference of 17 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash gold shop's own brand gold was 2,115 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,100 yuan. The current bidding gold is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and no deals were made.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments Rise and Fall</p>
<p>The selling price of silver house gold ornaments per tael initially did not change. However, at 9:42, because the Shanghai Clearing House (烚赤) opening was quite firm in the morning, the price was raised by 1 yuan. Not long after, about ten minutes later, because the Shanghai Clearing House (烚赤) potential was downward, the price immediately fell back by 1 yuan. After that, no changes were seen, and the result was no gain or loss. Da Tong Hang still maintained the original price of 214 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang was 212 yuan, with a purchase price of 206 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Suddenly Reduced by Half a Penny</p>
<p>According to a London telegram from the 3rd, the price of British pure gold suddenly reduced by half a penny per ounce, falling to £7 8s 5½d. As a result, the central bank's purchase price of Chinese cash also decreased to 1,211 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed customs gold remained flat, at 2 yuan 3 jiao 9 fen 6 li. The Shanghai standard bidding gold price also fell by 4 jiao, at 1,207 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Futures: Selling Trend Intensifies, Exchange Rate Relaxes, Arbitrage Uninteresting</h3>
<p>Although the exchange market yesterday saw Hua Shang yarn and cotton gangs and major foreign firms competing to aggressively buy spot and forward British and American gold, and the British bank Youli (acting for the Tianjin gang) also followed suit, buying spot sterling, because British and American foreign banks were still maintaining their selling prices for spot goods, especially with the forward selling intentions being stronger, and because Hong Kong suddenly came to dump spot sterling, the capital position felt quite ample, so the market situation was now flat and forward was looser. As a result, the swap gradually narrowed. At present, the monthly difference is only 0.03125 for sterling and only 0.0625 for US exchange. The spot-month is weak, with sterling around 0.1875 and US exchange around 0.3125. The total monthly interest (excluding commission) is only about 3.7%, so the arbitrage mindsets of general wealthy merchants are gradually becoming uninteresting. Trading was brisk. The Hong Kong exchange rate initially hardened slightly because the banks were selling aggressively, but the foreign firms took advantage of the cheapness and repeatedly aggressively bought, causing it to return to flat.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the London long-term and short-term shrank by 0.0625, New York silver prices remained stagnant, London bullion fell by half a penny, the exchange rate for British against American fell by a little over 0.1%, against Shanghai fell by 0.03125, against French unchanged, American against British fell by 0.0625, against Shanghai unchanged, against French shrank by 0.0625. Central posted exchange rates as before. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, British exchange at 8.25 pence, US exchange at 16.0625 yuan, both unchanged from the previous close. After opening, Hua Shang yarn and cotton gangs and major foreign firms competed to aggressively buy spot sterling and US gold, but because British and American banks were still willing to sell, there was little change. Hua Shang yarn and cotton gangs and foreign firms successively settled spot sterling at 8.25 pence with HSBC and Macao Lee, and also bought spot US exchange at 16.0625 yuan with Hua Bi and a certain bank. When HSBC posted its price, it was unchanged, and when the silver equalization tax was announced, it fell by half a point, with a levy of 6.25%. After that, although Youli, a foreign bank, aggressively bought spot sterling on behalf of the Tianjin gang, the situation remained largely unchanged because Hong Kong telegrams came to sell. Hong Kong telegrams sold spot sterling at 8.25 pence to Youli. Later, Hua Shang yarn and cotton gangs and foreign firms came to aggressively buy forward US exchange, but the foreign firms had stronger buying intentions for forward, and Hua Bi, a foreign firm, frequently sold August US exchange to yarn and cotton gangs and foreign firms from 15.625 yuan, loosening to 0.6875. Subsequently, Holland, a foreign firm, also bought August British gold at 8.0625 pence from foreign firms, so the process was slightly looser and harder. Near noon, East Asia Anda also sold spot Hong Kong exchange to foreign firm money exchange firms at 55.625 yuan and 0.75, and the situation was slightly looser. By the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices for British and American exchange rates were no different from the morning opening. Hong Kong exchange was 55.75 yuan.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, although foreign firms still came to buy spot British and American gold, because foreign firms' selling intentions were still good, the underlying potential was ultimately difficult to change. It is estimated that when foreign firms settled, foreign firm Hua Bi and Holland settled spot US exchange at 16.0625 yuan, and then bought spot sterling at 8.25 pence from British bank HSBC. After entering, foreign firms also bought spot Hong Kong exchange at 55.625 yuan from foreign firm Anda Holland, and the situation returned to flat. By the evening closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 8.725 pence for British exchange, 16.0625 yuan for US exchange, and 55.625 yuan for Hong Kong exchange. As a result, the British, American, and Hong Kong exchange rates were all unchanged from the closing price of the night before.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Loosen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold fell by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate fell by 0.0625. Foreign exchange firms in the local port settled a lot, and the yarn and cotton gangs had a great need. Fortunately, the banks supplied smoothly, and the market price was as stable as before. Forward also trended toward loosening. At the opening of the Shanghai Clearing House (烚赤), gold shops and silver houses were absorbing very strongly. Later, money exchange firms and clients, etc., made profits and supplied. In the afternoon, supply and demand were very scarce, and people's hearts were restless and uncertain. The result was a slight increase. Foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, were absorbed quite heavily by the wealthy. British and American gold notes were actively traded, and the supply was relatively abundant. Moreover, exchange bills and forward were loosening together, and the market price trended toward loosening. The need for French franc notes and Australian gold notes was relatively scarce, and the market price dropped slightly. The guild's transactions did not open. Yesterday's market price, British gold notes fell by 4 points, US gold notes fell by half a point, French franc notes fell by 2.5 hao, Australian gold notes fell by 1 jiao, and all other currencies did not change.</p>
<h3>Tianjin, Hong Kong, and Shanghai Exchange Rates Rise and Fall Differently</h3>

<h3>"Counterfeit Notes" Slightly Recover</h3>
<p>Tianjin, 4th Telegram: Compared with the morning opening on the 3rd, the black market exchange rate for counterfeit "Joint Reserve Bank Notes" was 4 yuan 5 jiao higher. 100 yuan of legal tender can buy 130 yuan of "Joint Reserve Bank Notes", that is, 1 yuan of "Joint Reserve Bank Notes" is only worth 7 jiao 6 fen 923 li of legal tender.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Falls Back by One Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's bill discount rate suddenly reversed and fell. Initially, it was fluctuating around 51 yuan and a half per thousand yuan in the morning, then immediately fell to 51 yuan. At noon, it rose again to 51 yuan 2 jiao half. In the afternoon, it was even more unsustainable and once fell back to 50 yuan 0.25 jiao. Finally, it was 50 yuan 0.5 jiao, which was actually 1 yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Closed Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association's Joint Preparatory Committee yesterday sent a circular to all banks, stating that the Central Bank had sent a letter stating that "May 5th is the anniversary of the establishment of the revolutionary government." As per usual practice, it will be closed for one day on this day. All bills receivable and payable by the bank and the Central Trust Bureau on the 5th will be processed the following day (the 6th). As for other banks and money shops, they will operate as usual.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Cannot Be Held Down</h3>
<p>The securities black market remains fluctuating and uncertain. Buying and selling are both extremely slow. However, the bulls are closely watching for occasional drops in market prices. When the German character Tong Shun and No. 41, etc., are sold slightly more, and the price is slightly weaker by one or two jiao, the bulls will come to pull them up, and they must restore them to their original state before stopping. There was no change in the situation in the afternoon. No. 10, No. 41, and Shun Tai were sold, and Da Lai, Lian He, and No. 35 were bought. The market price was slightly higher by 5 fen. The results of the full day's market price were only slightly better by 5 fen 1 jiao. The total transaction volume was about 500,000 yuan. Today, Sun Yat-sen's inauguration as Extraordinary President is a memorial holiday, and the market is closed. The details are listed in the table below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Chinese Merchant Securities shares were traded at a price of 29 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen.</p>
<p>There were not many transactions on the Shanghai Public Association Stock Market, but the market atmosphere can be called good. Ken Zhi shares suddenly rose to 8 yuan. At closing, there were sellers at this price and buyers at 7 yuan 9 jiao. Rui Rong common shares were priced at 7 yuan 4 jiao, and demand was very strong. Yi He shares were slightly weaker due to the drop in yarn prices. The closing bid price was 18 yuan 7 jiao, and the asking price was 18 yuan 8 jiao. Rubber shares seemed to have a turnaround, but the transaction volume was small because the bid price and asking price were too far apart.</p>
<p>London British Merchant Far East Companies' stock market prices on the 3rd of this month (Wednesday) rose slightly. HSBC Bank British registered shares rose by half a pound, priced at 84 and a half pounds. Gula Klumpang Rubber shares rose by 7 and a half pence, priced at 17 shillings 6 pence. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>London Chinese foreign debt market prices on the 3rd of this month (Wednesday): Only the Reorganization Loan bonds rose by half a pound, priced at 51 and a half pounds. The rest were undecided.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Major Players Return to the Market, Cotton Yarn Falling Wind Revives, Actual Sales Only Reach Two-Tenths</h3>
<p>The yarn market is unpredictable, and the falling wind has revived. In reality, those who used to drag and abuse the market in the past, seeing that customer sales are not smooth, are undecided. At the same time, among them, the major players who emerged at the peak are coming back to sell. According to the market, they are deliberately suppressing the price with the intention of still going long. As a result, the market chips are feeling even looser, and the trend is unusually chaotic for a while. The waves of the market price are huge, making people shudder. However, those outside the industry are still entering and exiting frequently, and the briskness of the transactions is also considerable. Therefore, it has created a situation of crazy rising and crazy falling. Judging from the above situation, the future is still in stormy waves. The reason is that the rise in the past was too violent, and the fall today is too rapid. The false wind revived in the afternoon, and the spot price of 20-count Shuang Ma foreign stock yarn fell sharply to 420 yuan. After the price fell, it aroused the recovery intentions of certain parties, saying that it was 30 yuan lower than the peak price on Monday, and they worked hard to buy in on the table. As a result, the momentum was revived, jumping up 6 yuan in an instant, and doing business at 426 yuan again, but it was still flat after closing, and the stock order price was 424 yuan.</p>
<p>The situation of spot yarn: At the opening in the early morning, the market situation rose slightly, but the Hong Kong gang had a slight stomachache, and the opening price did not move. The spot price of 20-count Shuang Ma was 433 yuan, and it fell by 2 yuan shortly after. Then, the selling wind suddenly flourished, and the shouting was deafening. The market price gradually declined, falling to 425 yuan, and the stock order price was 415 yuan. Then, certain parties felt it was a great bargain and came back to buy, and they saw a recovery of two or three yuan. The opening in the afternoon was slightly weaker, and the selling momentum was even stronger, and the falling wind started again. In an instant, the spot yarn of 20-count Shuang Ma foreign stock fell to 420 yuan, and the stock order price was 413 yuan. Later, the hoarders, greedy for its cheapness, suddenly dragged in, and the recovery wind rose again, reaching 426 yuan, and the stock order price was 417 yuan. It is said that after closing, there were many people willing to sell, but they could not make a deal. It is found that the total amount bought by each gang throughout the day was 2,455 bales, and the market price of 20-count Shuang Ma Tian Nu fell by 7 or 8 yuan compared with the previous day. Others also fell by 3 or 5 yuan, etc. 80% of the transactions in the market were ball transactions. Today, 565 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou, and 110 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Same Industry: 1,950; Hong Kong: 220; Mainland: 285; Total: 2,455.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market is still chaotic, but market transactions have been greatly reduced. Because the rise and fall are too great, everyone is wary. However, the market price has fallen again, and 20-count Yueqin withdrew to start at 383 yuan, and did business at 375 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Overseas Prices Reported to Rise, Indian Cotton Transactions Becoming More Prosperous</h3>
<p>Local Cotton Similar to Stagnation</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: New York presented a beautiful appearance, and the opening rose by 7 pounds. Improved stocks and cotton area weather were the main reasons for the rise. Counterparts also bought in, and the results rose by 2 to 7 pounds. India was closed yesterday, but the black market rise wind was very strong. White Rock April and May have risen to a high price of 159. Egypt has also risen by more than 10 pounds. Forward exchange is still tight. Converted to legal tender, cotton prices have all risen. It is estimated that American cotton and Brazilian cotton have risen by 6 jiao per dan, Indian cotton has risen by 5 jiao, and Egyptian cotton has risen by more than 6 jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai have become more active, and factory demand is gradually increasing. This is because American cotton reserves are thin, there is no definite news about the release of loan cotton, and the new cotton will not appear for more than four months. The transportation and sale of cotton produced in our guerrilla area is very difficult. Therefore, in recent days, factories have been ordering large quantities of foreign cotton, especially Indian cotton. Yesterday, Chinese factories ordered 8,000 bales of Indian cotton, and British and Japanese factories ordered 5,000 bales. If the Indian cotton market can drop by a few rupees, the factories will all order large quantities. The factory prices of yesterday's cotton market are recorded below:</p>
<p>Local cotton business is similar to stagnation. In reality, goods are scarce and prices are high, so factories are purchasing and ordering Indian and American cotton to supplement their use. Local cotton transactions have decreased sharply, but the market price has not fallen, and it is slightly weak. The cotton market situation is rarely exciting. The source of Su Bei is also not prosperous. 287 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived, and 408 pieces of Qidong cotton arrived. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.</p>
<h3>Recent Trends in the Cotton Waste Industry</h3>
<p>The Yangshupu Japanese Shanghai Spinning Factory's cotton waste originally opened bids for purchase on the first of each month. People of any nationality could bid for purchase. However, starting this month, it has been decided to cancel the bidding. All the factory's cotton waste will be purchased at any time by the Shanghai Japanese cotton waste industry members. Chinese and foreign merchants have no right to participate. Other Japanese yarn factories are still in progress. This matter is not controlled by the Japanese military, as rumored outside. It is entirely caused by the Shanghai Japanese cotton waste industry members manipulating and dominating the industry.</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese domestic rayon industry has been quite developed. In the past, the industry mostly used wood pulp as a manufacturing raw material, but now it has all been changed to cotton waste and old batting, and a large amount of this raw material has been ordered from Shanghai Japanese merchants. This is also a factor that promotes the control of the Shanghai Japanese cotton waste industry.</p>
<p>After the war, the establishment of small yarn factories in Shanghai was like bamboo shoots after a rain, and the raw materials used were entirely medium and high-grade cotton waste to spin coarse yarn. Therefore, the local cotton waste price is higher than the export price. Foreign firms in Shanghai's cotton waste export industry also have no transactions to do. All they can do is only a small amount of medium-grade and low-grade goods.</p>
<p>Others, such as Chinese Shangxin, Yong'an, and foreign firms Chongxin, etc., are not within the scope of Japanese control. However, Dagu Pass was destroyed by artillery fire, and less than 25% of the machines can be started than before the war. The cotton waste produced is extremely rare. On the one hand, demand exceeds supply, so both sides go in opposite directions, creating a new record high price that is unprecedented.</p>
<p>Since they pay the highest price, they still cannot get the same quality goods as in the past. Since the price of domestic cotton has risen, Shanghai yarn factories mostly use low-grade Indian cotton due to price reasons. The weaving dimension and quality of Indian cotton are not as good as domestic cotton, especially the cotton waste, which is even more different.</p>
<p>After the Japanese merchants controlled the market, it is also difficult to completely monopolize it. A small part of the cotton waste still needs to be resold to Chinese merchants, such as low-grade goods such as pulp bottom scraps. The price of this low-grade goods is very low. If you want to transport it to Japan, the handling fees such as packing and water feet will exceed the original price of the goods. Therefore, this is not what they like to do. According to the above observations, the prospects for Shanghai cotton waste export foreign firms are very bleak. The future transaction path is only a small amount of medium-grade and low-grade goods. (Qi)</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Small Investors Hope to Sell Cheaply; Prices Differ by Fifty Cents; Eastern Piece Goods Show Frequent Low Bids</h3>
<p>Country Cloth: After the recent unprecedented surge in cloth prices, actual sales have remained low. However, with many holders in advantageous positions, there has been little change for the time being. Most manufacturers are rushing to weave orders, and weaving costs, including raw yarn materials, are uniformly increasing. Therefore, quoted prices are higher than those for finished goods on the market. Consequently, wealthy individuals inside and outside the industry are not loosening their grip and continue to buy and hoard. Over three hundred pieces of coarse cloth, fine twill, colored cloth, bleached cloth, linen, and goods for travel outfits have changed hands. Small investors have quickly reaped substantial profits on their goods, often reducing prices by several cents per piece to quickly sell. The difference between high and low prices in the market can reach as much as fifty cents per piece. Wholesale shops in this street sold a total of five to six thousand pieces of white goods, coarse cloth, fine cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, poplin, bleached cloth, linen gauze, and printed cloth to inland merchants from Wuxi, Nanjing, Taizhou, Xinghua, and Bengbu. Dyeing factories handled over three thousand pieces of coarse and fine gray fabric, mercerized cotton, and drill. Merchants from Tianjin continued to load large quantities of poplin, striped bleached khaki cloth. Merchants from Guangdong handled over one hundred pieces of fine cloth, and sixty to seventy boxes of colored cloth, colored twill, and poplin. Merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan, with the upcoming addition of two Greek merchant ships to the Haiphong shipping line this month, which will increase cargo capacity, slightly increased cargo entry. They handled over one hundred pieces of factory cloth, colored cloth, striped bleached goods, and other items.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Fine cloth and fine twill saw sluggish sales yesterday, and businesses in this street took the opportunity to sell short, with frequent low bids in the market. Fine cloth fell by more than twenty cents per piece, while spot fine twill fell by ten cents, and futures fell by thirty-five cents. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth is currently priced at fourteen yuan and fifty cents per piece. Besides speculation, actual sales are very weak. Dyeing businesses in this street handled approximately eight to nine hundred pieces of various brands of spot and futures goods. However, foreign firms have not opened up sales, and outside hoarders are still buying cheap. The market shows signs of hovering.</p>
<p>Exports: One hundred and fifty pieces of cloth were exported to Shantou on the fifth, and twenty pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Price Limits Exist in Name Only</h3>
<p>Country Rice: No rice arrived from the river ports yesterday, but fourteen to fifteen hundred packages arrived from the Che Lun Baozi and Lai Su gangs, seven hundred and fifty packages from Wuxi, and five hundred packages from Kunshan. Since the sudden surge in the market since the day before yesterday, public sentiment has been very agitated, with high prices emerging in the black market. Top grade japonica rice has already reached fifteen yuan and thirty cents. However, in reality, the total rice stock in Shanghai has only decreased by thirty thousand packages. This situation is due to the manipulation of China's food supply by certain parties, with corrupt officials and merchants complicit in the scheme. Rice coming from the south is being detained at the Rice Market Ferry in large quantities and is not being released. It is said that only five trucks (each carrying one hundred and fifty packages) are allowed to be shipped out from Wuxi each day, but this needs to be verified. Rice from Songjiang is still being transported by foreign firms. Japanese and puppet merchants in the Su and Tong areas, seeing the large profits, are also trying to get involved. Not only rice but even pork is being detained, leading to drastic price increases. In the future, the only way to alleviate the suffering in life is to hope for victory. However, because the price limits were supposedly being "officially" relaxed the day before, many people dragged in rice. Afterward, they would rather quietly sell at higher prices in the black market, while nominally adhering to the price limits, and many people also returned goods. Therefore, when the market opened yesterday, public sentiment calmed down, and shops in this street and hoarders only traded among themselves. As a result, thick and thin japonica rice prices were stable, and Du Yang Jian, Bu Jian, and Bian Yuan prices were also uneventful.</p>
<p>Ke Xian: Trains and riverboats have been arriving continuously in recent days. Yesterday, approximately six thousand packages of new Jing and Wu Xian rice arrived. Since the Shanghai price increased step by step, it has prompted transportation by merchants. Therefore, hoarders suddenly stopped handling them, and shops in this street could not even sell a total of three thousand packages. It is said that the selling price of Jing and Wu Xian rice was subsequently reduced by ten cents.</p>
<h3>Flour Rises Another Ten Cents</h3>
<p>Number Two Flour Already at Four Yuan and Fifty-Five Cents; Rumors Say Tianjin Flour Can Be Sold for Five Yuan</p>
<p>Flour prices rose again yesterday, according to flour mill prices. Although sales once slowed down after the flour price increased step by step, demand picked up again yesterday. According to news from the Beiyang gang, Tianjin flour can be sold for five yuan, so transportation profits are quite good. Some people are hoarding Tianjin flour every day, all because of the high price expectations. Retail sales in the Nanyang gang are also lively. Under the circumstances of active sales, the factory fears that raw materials from abroad will rise again, and that stocks will be depleted and production will be scarce. Therefore, they are repeatedly raising prices to limit the large-scale supply. The price of Number Two flour rose five cents in the morning yesterday, only for retail transactions in this street. It rose another five cents in the afternoon, reaching four yuan and fifty-five cents in cash. As a result, in addition to transactions in this street, the North and South gangs and other small investors traded a total of fifty to sixty thousand packages. According to market talk, this surge in rice prices is related to the future of the flour market, so public sentiment is still bullish.</p>
<p>Foreign flour is also showing strength. It is found that overseas production prices are frequently rising, and forward prices have reached four yuan and eighty cents in US dollars. It is said that a certain foreign firm will have more than one hundred thousand packages of Flag flour arriving today, and the market is quite stable. It is said that the market price of foreign flour is gradually equal to that of factory flour, generally four yuan and fifty-five cents and four yuan and fifty cents in cash, but there is no substantial transaction.</p>
<p>Exports: Twelve thousand packages were shipped to Tianjin today, and eight thousand packages to Shantou.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Look Bullish But Difficult; Foreign Wheat Arrives Continuously</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of local wheat was still scarce. Since flour prices increased step by step, holders are all sticking to their holdings, waiting for a good price. However, the current wheat market environment is not comparable to the flour market. Today, another seven thousand tons of Australian wheat arrived in Shanghai, and foreign firms are repeatedly offering forward foreign wheat. It is said that bulk shipments of Flag wheat are only six yuan and sixty to seventy cents, which is cheaper than local wheat. However, the shipping schedule will take two months. The future of local wheat is greatly affected. Currently, all factories are using foreign wheat, and the demand for local wheat may be difficult to develop for the time being. The formal market will likely have to wait for the new wheat to arrive.</p>
<p>Additional: Seven thousand seven hundred and thirteen tons of Australian wheat, or ninety-two thousand and eleven packages, handled by foreign firms, were transported to Shanghai by the King William, managed by Jardine Matheson. It was originally scheduled to arrive yesterday and was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the ship is moving slowly and will not be able to enter port until this morning, and will be berthed at buoys nine and ten for unloading.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Even Soybeans Cannot Hold Up</h3>
<p>Market Falls by More Than Ten Cents</p>
<p>Recently, the Dalian soybean market relied on the unified control issue to support its monopoly, so it was able to maintain its original price for six or seven days. However, sales were not active, leading to a decline of more than ten cents. It is estimated that five trucks of spot Dalian soybeans are priced at nine yuan and seven to two cents. A truck to be delivered in two weeks is also priced at nine yuan and two cents. Other beans are, in fact, only embellishments. Therefore, with supply and demand evenly matched, the market is quite stable. It is estimated that more than one hundred packages of Chongming sand yellow beans were traded at a price of nine yuan and five cents to eight yuan and eighty cents, one hundred and ten packages of Nanjing beans at a price of eight yuan and sixty-five cents, and one hundred packages of Wuhu beans at a price of nine yuan and twenty cents delivered. Two hundred and fifty packages of beans will be shipped to Shantou on the fifth.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Sales Remain Strong</h3>
<p>New York Silk Market Unrelentingly High; Will Cause Silk Mills to Purchase Substitutes</p>
<p>Overseas silk market, rising winds are still strong. Yokohama spot prices rose fifteen yuan, forward prices rose eight yuan. New York standard silk recently rose two cents, forward streamlined rose one point eight three seven five cents. Japanese silk each rose five cents. Shanghai silk then still no opening. Regarding Japan and the US silk price, soaring wings have reached the top. The largest consumer of raw silk, the United States, even if the phenomenon of spot squeeze, still has not reduced slightly. But these silk prices, will also be incompatible with silk prices. Furthermore, the United States in the near future, will have a further artificial silk, named Nylon (according to this kind of fiber is no matter the difference with current artificial silk, can be said to be completely like real silk), then the raw silk spot squeeze, will lead silk mills to purchase substitutes, and more quickly to achieve the appearance of the best substitutes.</p>
<p>Local silk market, white factory seven eight points, foreign firms enter the stomach very hard, market price rose twenty yuan, unfortunately only one hundred packages traded, French Zhuang also followed to absorb purchases yesterday, white factory B character RR price one seven five zero -- one seven six five yuan, doing open sixty dan, for Ren Chang and other firms to buy, US Zhuang silk is Ta Chang · Jardine · Ren Ji · more active, Jingli through the US sales, only a power generation yesterday, Indian foreign firms then enter ten dan, the price opened original market,</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Raw Soybean Oil Hoarders Take Profits and Exit</h3>
<p>Yesterday's raw soybean oil market situation, continuing the previous day's momentum, seemed likely to advance, but general floating hoarders locked in profits, and with the source temporarily not expected to be cut off, the chips suddenly felt abundant, and large hoarders' appetites were also weak. Prices fell one yuan, and one hundred and fifty pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were traded at a price of thirty-seven yuan. Road goods also opened at thirty-seven yuan, and one hundred and forty pieces were traded. Dalian soybean oil was opened at one hundred and fifty barrels at a price of forty-five yuan and fifty-five cents, Fengnian oil fifty barrels, forty-five yuan, white pressed oil ten barrels, forty yuan and five cents.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dutch Sugar Rising Winds Still Fierce</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Dutch sugar production area forward nine ten eleven months according to C.I.F. cases for Dutch shield nine · two zero, rose zero · three five, seven eight months according to C.I.F. cases for six · two eight, nine months five · six two five, Taikoo sugar still in suspension of sale, so the market situation still up exhibition. Public association plate, two four coarse white original warehouse goods rose nearly yuan, initially for twenty-nine yuan eight angles, then slightly back loose to six angles, outer warehouse goods six angles to four angles, re-export cargo initially planned twenty-one yuan three angles, spin up twenty-one yuan half, the last return to three angles half to two angles half, a total of more than two thousand packages traded, Dutch red rose seven angles, spot for nineteen yuan two angles, re-export thirteen yuan seven angles, one or two hundred packages traded, the factory white rose half yuan, Zhen Ji No. 1 twenty-nine yuan, the factory ice rose yuan half, No. 1 ice thirty-four yuan half, Jing Ming ice thirty-six yuan, Taikoo car white rose four angles, B mark west warehouse twenty-eight yuan eight angles, National sugar Hainan red rose four angles, to thirteen yuan two angles traded three hundred packages, positive cotton red rose four five angles, on the brand seventeen yuan three angles, followed by seventeen yuan to sixteen yuan eight nine angles, opened more than one hundred and sixty packages, reduced green sixty packages, thirteen yuan half,</p>
<h3>Seafood: Western Dried Mussels, New and Old, Are in Demand</h3>
<p>Since the arrival of new Western dried mussels, the number released has been surprisingly small. Recently, a small batch of small dried mussels arrived and has already been sold out. The price is seventy-five yuan, which is five yuan higher than before. It is found that the medium and large colored old goods here will also be sold out.</p>
<h3>Metals: Eastern White Iron Rises By Some Cents</h3>
<p>A lot of spot Eastern white iron came from Osaka a few days ago, causing the selling price in this port to decline. Moreover, Japanese manufacturers in this port are also releasing a large amount of spot goods, so the market has been depressed. Customers and buyers are aware of the abundance of goods in the market. Recently, Osaka shipments cannot be shipped due to the Japanese government's control, so the Japanese manufacturers in this port are in high spirits, and the selling price has also been gradually increased. Recently, such as 37 inches each sell two yuan seven jiao five cents, 36 inches two yuan one jiao six cents, are more than one jiao one two cents better than the previous market. In terms of sales to customers, it has not been very active recently. The only reliance of the market is the construction gang in this street. There are few other outlets, and there are no new developments in the whole city.</p>

<p>Chinese Medicine and Food Therapy</p>
<h3>Women with Metrorrhagia and Irregular Menstruation Should Often Eat Donkey-Hide Gelatin and Glutinous Rice Porridge</h3>
<p>— Xie Yenong</p>
<p>A woman's menstrual period occurs once a month, with the menstrual fluid flowing slowly. The period is vigorous for three to five days, after which it gradually decreases and clears. This is the normal situation. If the date is early or late, and the flow is too much or too little, these are all signs of illness. Metrorrhagia and spotting are one type of menstrual disorder. If there are blood clots mixed in with the menstrual blood, and it does not stop for a long time, this is a precursor to metrorrhagia and should be given immediate attention. One should rest quietly and avoid strenuous activity, as movement can prevent the ruptured blood vessels from clotting and make it difficult to stop the bleeding. When it develops into metrorrhagia, the blood rushes down in large quantities, like a breached dam. At this time, the body suddenly loses nourishment, and the complexion turns pale. The skin, lips, and fingertips also turn white as death. The spirit weakens, strength diminishes, the heart palpitates, the limbs become numb, and sensation becomes dull, even leading to sudden collapse and fainting. To attempt emergency treatment, only use Jilin ginseng decoction for forced feeding. After the bleeding stops, observe the symptoms and take medication such as Chinese angelica, white peony, astragalus, white atractylodes, licorice, and codonopsis to regulate the condition.</p>
<p>Spotting is chronic bleeding, with the menstrual period trickling continuously, accompanied by symptoms such as lower back pain, fatigue, dizziness, decreased appetite, and other symptoms. The condition is not as serious as metrorrhagia, and the risk is also less. However, before metrorrhagia occurs, it often starts with prolonged spotting. In other words, prolonged spotting can potentially develop into metrorrhagia, so it is advisable to treat it quickly upon seeing spotting. The causes of metrorrhagia and spotting may be falls, impacts, damage from sexual activity, or excessive emotions, sudden anger, and severe stimulation of the nervous system. The main cause is qi deficiency, which prevents blood from being contained, and the onset of the disease leads to a large deficiency of blood. The method of treatment, in addition to using ginseng soup for emergency relief, after the disease has subsided and during the process of spotting, is to prioritize nourishing and replenishing blood. However, blood is not easily produced quickly, and cultivation must be achieved gradually over time. Now, I will introduce a simple and easy-to-implement porridge therapy: cook three measures of glutinous rice into porridge, and when it is almost cooked, add two liang of clear donkey-hide gelatin, cook until it dissolves and mix evenly, and have the patient eat it. Donkey-hide gelatin is a top-grade blood-nourishing product in gynecology, and glutinous rice can benefit qi and strengthen the spleen. When used together, they can tonify deficiency, stop bleeding, and greatly benefit the stomach and intestines. Therefore, this prescription may seem plain and unremarkable, but it is extremely effective with long-term consumption.</p>
<h3>Dietary Dos and Don'ts After Childbirth</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruwei</p>
<p>After childbirth, a woman's body is weak, with depleted blood, and new blood gradually regenerating. At this time, attention to diet is most important. However, customs vary from place to place. For example, in the Jiangshi area (referring to the vicinity of Suzhou, Songjiang, Changzhou, and Taizhou), women mostly eat rice porridge for the first half-month after childbirth, and soft rice only in the second half-month. For ordinary dishes, dried vegetables are best (i.e., small Shanghai greens in winter), as they best nourish the stomach and generate fluids. Alternatively, use walnut kernels without the skin, deep-fried in oil, and mix with half each of pepper salt and white sugar. Or cook ham until tender and eat the soup and lean meat. All greasy and rich foods are forbidden. However, people from Ningbo do not eat porridge after childbirth, but only eat brown sugar paste noodles. In Tonglu and Fuyang in Zhejiang, Yixian in Anhui, and other places, eggs, chicken, or pork knuckles are eaten after childbirth, but raw, cold, sour, and spicy foods are avoided everywhere. The prescription book has a method of eating mutton after childbirth, but I say that this is suitable after the full moon. If the parturient cannot eat mutton, it can be replaced with tofu skin. All of these can help with physical strength after childbirth.</p>
<h3>Eating Duck is Most Suitable for Women with Multiple Births</h3>
<p>— Xu Jintao</p>
<p>When a woman is pregnant, the fetus eats the mother's blood every day for nourishment. If a woman has multiple births, it will inevitably lead to a large deficiency of qi and blood. Without proper recuperation, a weak body is likely to develop into postpartum tuberculosis. The symptoms include lower back pain, bone pain, weakness in the limbs, mental fatigue, dizziness, vertigo, blurred vision, tinnitus, and memory loss. This is because of excessive blood loss and the gradual depletion of the body. Although the body's blood can be replenished with medicine, each person's endowment is different, and the degree of loss varies. Although there are many drugs that are effective in tonifying, the medicinal properties are inevitably complex, and the strength may not be appropriate. It is better to supplement with foods that are nutritious and suitable for the appetite. Duck is sweet and cool in nature, nourishes the yin of the five organs, clears the heat of deficiency-consumption, replenishes blood, promotes water metabolism, nourishes the stomach, and generates fluids. Therefore, health practitioners say: "Stewing an old male duck until tender is more effective than ginseng essence." The effect of duck can be imagined. It is truly a supreme tonic for nourishing the body and nourishing yin for women with multiple births or those who have developed postpartum tuberculosis. (Following the Cantonese method of adding medicinal ingredients to dishes, you can add 4 qian of Chinese angelica, 4 qian of Chinese yam, 4 qian of Yuzhu, and three or four red dates when cooking duck. The power to nourish blood and maintain health will be even more remarkable. The taste may not be very palatable at first, but after three or four times, the medicinal taste will still be palatable. Sincerely recorded.)</p>
<h3>When Menstruation Comes</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Every fully developed woman has the inconvenience of bleeding every month, which is menstruation. Healthy women generally have one menstruation every twenty-eight days, but there are exceptions: either one menstruation every thirty or more days, or one menstruation in less than twenty-eight days. As long as the number of days between each menstruation is the same, then there is no need to pay attention. Women's menstrual disorders are mostly caused by not paying attention to health during the menstrual period. If during the initial stage of development, actions are overworked, diet is raw and cold, and no care is taken, it will often result in lifelong suffering and affect the health of the body.</p>
<p>When menstruating, nineteen out of ten women feel tired and have uterine pain caused by the rupture of the egg and bleeding. At this time, all strenuous exercise should be prohibited, rest more, do not eat raw, cold, and stimulating foods, do not overeat, and eat more liquid and nutritious foods, such as milk, eggs, and vegetables. Decoction and drinking one qian of mugwort leaves and yellow wine every day can warm the uterus and regulate menstruation; or daily flush and drink five qian of Yimu paste with a little brown sugar and yellow wine, which also has the effect of promoting blood circulation and regulating menstruation. During this period, if you can eat a hen, the nutritional power will be great. The method is to wash a hen clean, and steam it rotten with three to five qian of Chinese angelica and a little yellow wine. Chinese angelica is an important medicine for replenishing and purifying blood, can treat all blood deficiency and blood turbidity, break evil blood, generate new blood, and replenish women's various deficiencies, and is a good medicine for regulating menstruation and replenishing blood. Eating it with chicken has a greater tonic power than ordinary tonics can compare.</p>
<h3>Food for Promoting Lactation</h3>
<p>— Fuming</p>
<p>The biggest problem in raising a baby is breastfeeding. When a baby is in the mother's belly, it is directly nourished by the mother's blood. After delivery, the mother's body naturally undergoes physiological changes, moving the blood needed for fetal nourishment to the mysterious breasts, and still providing it to the baby, but the color has changed from red to white. As the baby grows, the milk quality gradually thickens, and as the baby develops, the milk quality also changes with each passing day. Therefore, mother's milk is really the most suitable food for babies.</p>
<p>Suppose a healthy mother feeds her baby with her own milk every day. Unfortunately, one day her production suddenly decreases, causing the baby to be unable to eat enough and cry. Then the parents' worries are naturally self-evident, and they must come up with various things that can replace breast milk to make up for it. However, some are for economic reasons, and if they are not careful, the baby's delicate spleen and stomach can easily develop diseases, and gradually weaken, or even die.</p>
<p>Why does a mother's milk suddenly decrease? In most cases, it is due to illness or poor nutrition, of course, there are other reasons. Now I will specially introduce two kinds of food therapy methods as follows:</p>
<p>(1) One pair of pig trotters, remove all hair and dirt; add three qian of Akebia trifoliata, and cook a thick juice together, the thicker the better, add a little salt, and the taste is light is better, take the pig trotters and juice as a side dish, although Akebia trifoliata tastes bitter, if you remove Akebia trifoliata do not use, then its function is slightly worse.</p>
<p>(2) Take one black crucian carp, wash it clean, add a few scallions, a few pieces of raw lard, and other seasonings, and cook the juice together to drink it. Its effect is great. Mothers with lack of milk, why not try it.</p>
<h3>Raw Food and Cooked Food</h3>
<p>— Xu Linyan</p>
<p>Human physiology is inherently suitable for cooked food, but completely cooked food without a slight admixture of raw food is not a healthy way. Considering the benefits of cooked food, they are (1) suitable for human physiology, (2) disinfection, (3) flavoring, (4) easy digestion; the benefits of raw food are (1) aiding digestion, (2) fully absorbing the nutrients it contains, (3) adjusting the taste, (4) promoting the body's metabolism. Therefore, cooked food and raw food should be equally emphasized.</p>
<p>Among raw foods, the most suitable for the human body are fruits.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of fruit, the vitamins it contains are extremely rich. It is extremely beneficial to eat a little after exertion and after meals. However, the current price of fruits is expensive, and it is no longer affordable for the average person. The only inexpensive item is the tomato.</p>
<p>Tomatoes are red in color and slightly sour in taste. They are produced everywhere. The suburbs of Shanghai abundantly cultivate this item. Westerners have it almost every meal. The various vitamins it contains are extremely rich. When eating, wash its skin first, then soak it in boiling water, and then peel off its skin. Add a little salt or white sugar to eat it, and the taste is extremely delicious. Regular consumption can nourish blood, promote bowel movements, generate fluids, aid digestion, and lengthen strength. Its effects are hard to describe completely; if cooked with meat, it also has a different taste.</p>
<h3>Whooping Cough</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zanchen</p>
<p>Whooping cough is initially caused by external contraction of wind and evil. In the beginning, there is a slight chill and fever, nasal congestion and heavy voice, slight cough and sticky phlegm. At this time, people generally do not pay attention to it because of the ordinariness of the symptoms. After one or two weeks, the evil will be suppressed in the lungs and not ventilated. The tracheal mucosa changes as a result, and breathing becomes increasingly short, resulting in an air-reversed state. Coughing then has continuous bursts, even nausea; after a short break, the cough recurs, occurring three or four times to dozens of times a day. The phlegm that is coughed up is a transparent mucus. If treatment is improper, it can often last for two or three months, so it is commonly called "100-day cough". Those who are most susceptible to this disease are children aged one to six, and there are many sufferers when the weather is cold and warm in spring and winter. The method of treatment is to use equal parts of almonds and walnut kernels, remove the skins, mash them into a paste, and add a little ginger, decoction into a soup for flushing. Almonds can benefit the lungs, moisten dryness, relieve coughs and remove phlegm, and are an essential medicine for treating coughs; although walnuts are common foods, because they contain fatty oils, they are extremely rich in nutrition and can cure coughs and sputum; ginger can dispel cold, stop vomiting, resolve phlegm, and reduce secretions. When used together, they are truly a wonderful prescription for treating whooping cough. However, attention must also be paid to the patient's daily nutrition and room temperature to assist.</p>
<h3>Food Therapy Maxims</h3>
<p>— Zhang Liangzhi</p>
<p>Disease enters through the mouth (mouth inscription)</p>
<p>Food has three transformations: (1) Fire transformation—cooked thoroughly. Mouth transformation—chewed finely. (2) Abdominal transformation—transformed by the stomach itself. (Hua Tuo)</p>
<p>Lack of moderation in eating and drinking is the cause of disease. (Gao Panlong)</p>
<p>A light diet can provide a lot of nourishment. (Lu Di Xian Jing)</p>
<p>Fragrant and delicious, crispy, strong wine, fatty meat, sweet taste and disease shape. (Han Feizi)</p>
<p>Chew white rice finely, chew until it is糜 rotten and swallow it, nourish the heart fluid, the abdominal taste is endless, and the benefits are also endless. (He Yangheng)</p>
<p>Eating and drinking a light diet can cure diseases and prolong life. (Empress Xiaowen of Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p>Do not eat quickly, as it will damage the spleen, the law should be to chew thoroughly to make it fine. (Medical Talk)</p>
<p>Do not speak while eating (Confucius)</p>
<p>Eat one less bite at dinner and live to ninety-nine. (Old proverb)</p>
<p>In summer, regardless of old or young, eat warm things, and in autumn, you will not suffer from cholera and vomiting. (Yao Xian)</p>
<p>Hot mother burns the lips, cold mother freezes the teeth. (Baopuzi)</p>
<h3>Nutritional Value of Soybeans</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhensheng</p>
<p>Among agricultural products, the richest in nutrients is soybeans. There are many of its products, such as soy milk, tofu, dried tofu, soy sauce, and soybean sprouts, all of which contain very rich nutrients. According to Li Shizhen, "Eating too many soybeans makes people feel heavy." The four words "makes people feel heavy" are worth savoring, meaning that soybeans are rich in protein and fat, and long-term consumption can make people fat and healthy and increase body weight.</p>
<p>According to scientists, soybeans have five times the heat of potatoes, three times the protein, and two hundred times the fat; therefore, the nutritional value of soybeans is greater than that of any food. Soy milk made from soybeans is called artificial milk, and its nutritional value is no less than that of milk; moreover, the price is very low, and the public can take it.</p>
<p>Now, soybean sprouts made from soybeans have been greatly praised by the British government in the South Seas Islands. Originally, a small capitalist merchant named Hu in the South Seas founded a place specializing in the production of soybean sprouts and sold them to overseas Chinese. As usual, they had to be tested by British politics. Unexpectedly, the test results showed that this food was not only clean and hygienic, but also very rich in nutrients, so it was greatly praised by the British government, attracting the attention of foreign people. The merchant Hu's small business has tripled its profits.</p>
<p>In addition, foods made from soybeans are still very good, and most of them take its essence and discard its dross, and it goes without saying that they contain abundant nutrients. The efficacy and story of tofu do not need to be told.</p>
<h3>Common Cold and Cough</h3>
<p>— Zou Demin</p>
<p>Common cold and cough are caused by the invasion of wind evil into the lungs, resulting in the lungs' anti-evil response. Spring causes the human body's pores to open, making it easiest for wind evil to invade, so there are many sufferers. Symptoms include cough, headache, nasal congestion, and clear nasal discharge; in severe cases, fever occurs. This is because the lungs are affected by wind evil, causing the Qi to lose its cleansing and purifying function. Treatment with mild and appropriate medicine should be given, and the cough will stop naturally when the evil is dispelled. For example, medicines such as Qianhu (Peucedani Radix), Jiegeng (Platycodonis Radix), Xingren (Armeniacae Semen), and Suzi (Perillae Fructus) are often effective with just one dose. However, diet must be cautious, so avoiding certain foods is also a significant issue. Vegetarian and light flavors are most suitable, while sour, spicy, and fishy foods can irritate the lungs and easily worsen the cough. Rich and greasy foods can generate phlegm. People nowadays fear taking medicine, regarding a common cold as a minor ailment and not paying attention to it. Some even indulge in food, causing the evil to accumulate in the lungs, transforming into dryness and consuming Yin, resulting in a persistent and unproductive cough, dry mouth, hoarse voice, and eventually damaging the collaterals and coughing up blood, leading to serious mistakes. If it is a child, it is even easier to develop into severe pneumonia. Generally, carelessness in the beginning will surely lead to problems later.</p>
<h3>After Measles Subsides, Attention Should Still Be Paid to Wind-Cold and Diet</h3>
<p>— Zhu Zuosan</p>
<p>Often, measles progresses smoothly, but complications arise after the fever subsides. This is all due to carelessness in convalescence.</p>
<p>Measles originally belongs to seasonal epidemic diseases, and promoting eruption is the first priority. Therefore, when the measles has fully erupted and the fever subsides, the evil has been expelled, and the body temperature naturally decreases. Occasionally, some residual measles toxins may remain, but they can decompose on their own and are not a cause for concern. However, due to a slight negligence in protection, the caregivers may believe that the sick child can be allowed to be exposed to wind-cold and can have an unrestricted diet, leading to sudden complications. Because measles erupts in the lung meridian and has been scorched by heat, the lung's cleansing function is lost, and the cough persists. If one catches a cold, severe cases can lead to recurrence of fever and persistent cough. With stagnant lung Qi and excessive phlegm, the condition can turn into bronchitis or pneumonia. In mild cases, with or without fever, the cough will definitely worsen and become difficult to resolve, or it may persist, with lung heat accumulating internally and consuming Yin fluids, leading to post-measles consumption (wasting disease). In addition, because the stomach and intestines are also inflamed at the onset of measles, if the internal condition has not yet settled, careless eating of greasy and indigestible foods will inevitably cause fever, indigestion, and diarrhea, even leading to complications. Sometimes, it is due to the stomach's deficiency fire, leading to excessive appetite, and internal accumulation that persists for a long time often causes worms or malnutrition. Furthermore, contracting both cold and food stagnation can also have two courses, mild or severe, acute or chronic. Mild cases involve a sudden rise in body temperature and the eruption of "cloud rash" (secondary measles rash), which is still easily resolved. Severe cases can lead to internal accumulation causing convulsions or the concurrent onset of external pneumonia. Chronic cases develop gradually, leading to malnutrition and consumption, which are very difficult to treat. Therefore, after measles subsides, there are still points that must be noted, as follows:</p>
<p>Within one week after the fever subsides, it is still advisable to rest in bed. Although windows should be opened to allow air circulation, direct wind should be avoided. Clothing and bedding should not be reduced lightly. In terms of diet, fishy, greasy, stimulating, and triggering foods should be avoided. Daily meals should still consist of thin porridge or scorched rice porridge, accompanied by pickled vegetables (pickled cucumber, pickled radish), kohlrabi, dried jellyfish, dried bamboo shoots, and soft tofu. Snacks such as salty soda crackers, white lotus root powder, and fruits like pears, water chestnuts, red sugarcane, and oranges can be given in moderation. However, if the stool is loose, these should be avoided. After seven days, when the child's spirit gradually recovers, they can get out of bed, but it is still advisable to rest from time to time. Play should not be excessive. If the child is already in school, books should not be read, as eye strain may impair their vision in the future. When the appetite returns, rice can be given in small amounts, but the portion should be reduced by half of what they desire, to avoid overeating. The range of restricted foods can be gradually expanded, starting with vegetables such as spinach and peas, followed by eggs and ham. As for triggering foods such as salted mustard greens, they should still be avoided for several months, as they easily cause sores and scabies.</p>
