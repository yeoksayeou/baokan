<h3>中國的環境與抗戰</h3>
<p>最近一星期內，遠東一隅的時局呈現着異常弛張的狀態，全世界的目光，固然都瞬息不停地表示着錯愕驚奇；而置身慕中的中國人民，心理上必然的發生了極度的變幻。最先，外滙的暴跌，使人感受到異常的焦躁與煩悶；接着英日初步協定的內容暴露出來，全中國沒有一處不發生扼腕的呼聲；可是等到美日商約旦吿廢止，同時英日商的又有接踵廢止的醞釀，蘇聯對華信用借款也有已經商妥的消息，於是沒有一個中國人不突然興奮起來了。心理上的焦悶，不平或興奮，原是極自然的現象，固然沒有故意矜持的必要；不過，目前的局勢旣如此多變，以後的發展必更堪重視，中國國民在感情興奮的時候，更有運用理智密切注意時局前途的必要。</p>
<p>最近的幾件大事，固然沒有一件不和中日戰事有關的，然而又沒有一件不牽涉到國際關係的；這樣、就容易使人發生一種錯覺，以為中國問題的關鍵，完全繫在國際關係上。從這種錯覺演繹下去，好像中國抗戰前途的命運根本不握在自已的手上。其實，中國問題固然與世界問題息息相關；但是中國的命運，却決不握在他人手中，還是由自己把握着。蔣總裁在最近的紀念週發表意見時有幾句名言：「此决抗戰是完成革命的奮鬥。而革命是絕對不受外圍環境變遷的影響的」。中國國民應該把這句話深切地體味，理解到不管環境如何變遷，中國的前途還是在中國自已的掌握中間。</p>
<p>蔣總裁說這樣的話，正當英日訂立初步協定的時候，然而決不是中國表示失望以後的解嘲之詞。一國一民族的領袖，允其如蔣總裁這樣賢明的領袖，決不需要對本國的民衆講什麼解嘲的話；實在由於兩年來積聚着的慘痛的經騐，使中國人民不得不相信要希望抗戰成功，就應該不受外圍環境的影響。中國決不需要孤立，也決非不需要有利的環境；那未中國的抗戰和環境關係的問題，究竟應該怎樣呢？消極地說，如果環境不容許有利的話，中國並不需要更變自已的立塲；積極地說，一切有利的環境，決不能憑空產生，也需要中國把抗戰的決心和力量來切實爭取。當戰事初起的時候，國際間對中國雖有同情的呼聲，但是還不夠熱烈，不夠普遍，原因固然為了即使幾個眞正的友邦，也因為目身存在着種種的矛盾，表現在遠東問題上，不能表示積極的態度；可是更大的原因還在中國抗戰的決心和力量，根本沒有被世界所共同澈底認識淸楚。國際間旣錯認日本的侵略會適可而止，或者會尊重第三國在華的利益，同時又錯認了中國的抗戰未必眞能持久，因此徘徊瞻顧，除了在道義上表示同情以外，多數抱着暫作壁上觀的態度，沒有事實上的動作。然而中國却不顧一切地實行了抗戰，而且在抗戰中建設了自己，成長了自己，把自己從一塊鐵鍊成了鋼；同時就在這樣的過程中，爭取了各國的同情，爭取了援助，由正義的共鳴逐漸走上了實力的支持。這就是中國抗戰不取決於環境而爭取環境的實例，也就是所謂「天助自助者」「得道者多助」古訓的證騐。假使中國在當初對於外圍環境就存着患得患失的心，決沒有目前的進步；同樣的，為爭取最後的勝利起見，目前的中國也決不能對着環境抱患得患失的態度，一切都倚賴着環境。</p>
<p>再就當前的事實而論，我們所認為可以焦悶或扼腕的事，未必沒有打破沉悶的可能！例如外匯市塲經一度混亂以後，已漸歸甯靜；又如英國雖甘心承認了日方的原則，但具體問題的檢討還在未定之天，張伯倫正把英日協定的詞句合混，認為自鳴得意，安知其不作見風轉舵的佈置，反過來說，凡所認為値得興奮的事，也難保不發生枝節：美國旣宣佈廢止美日商的，第二步又將如何？假使日方曲盡媚態，那麼美國又將如何應付？而况世界風雲，日變月幻，事實推演，能吾不對遠東發生任何影響？如果以後的時局不能直綫進展，中國又將何以自處？那麼唯一的答案，就是中國應該堅守自己的立塲，認淸自己的道路，用鍥而不舍的精神，完成自已抗戰建國的目的。</p>
<p>再進一步說：以前的中國旣把抗戰的決心和力量，爭取了國際問的援助；以後的中國還是應該用更大的決心和力量，爭取世界上更廣大的援助。事實上兩年來抗戰成長裏的中國，無諭從軍事經濟政治各方面看，都已經遠勝於兩年以前，要爭取更廣大的援助決不是沒有把握的事。「得道者多助」，只消中國不變其道，中國一定是多助的。所以中國目前即使被認為漸漸走入有利的環境，但是怎樣保持這有利的環境，還在善用目前的基礎，把握更大的決心，培植更大的力量。</p>
<h3>英日意見對立　談判陷於僵局　日軍部堅持貫徹經濟要求　英政府催促撤除天津封鎖</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據每日電聞外交訪員所得之消息、駐日英大使克萊琪因東京談話中關於天津英租界禁用法幣與移交存銀兩點雙方意見參差、現向偷敦請示、英方意見以為法幣乃公認的中政府之通貨、英國不能禁共使用、而日方則謂法幣流通妨礙日方所欲使用的鈔票之成立（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據今日叱問消息、英外相哈里法克斯、顯受美國廢止美日商的之鼓勵、令日已訓令東京英大使命共從速催促日方撤除對於天津之封鎖、日方若繼績封鎖天津、則勢將影響柬京此後之談判矣、（二十九日美聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據此間所接消息、束京英日談判現已陷於僵局、英國大使克萊琪現為天津租界貨幣問題、正向倫敦請示新訓令、（二十九日海通電）</p>
<p>（東京）據日報消息、英日圓桌會議現有崩潰之象、因雙方代表對於法幣與存銀兩問題意見仍大相懸殊也、咋夜外務省與陸軍省人員集議此事、聞巳決定維持日方之見解、據日日新聞稱、日本陸軍抱有一種意見、以為如英方仍維持其不誠實之態度、則會議勢必完全破裂云、聞英代表以爲中國國家銀行所有白銀之放棄或保存、純為華人銀行自決之事、白銀之存於英租界、事出偶然且此為經濟問題故不能適用有田克萊琪之妥洽、惟日方則堅持經濟問題之解決維持天津和平秩序所必要、故英方根據有田克萊琪之妥洽、須接受日方要求、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日英東京會議談判天津治安問題、順利進行、獲得圓滿結果、及至討論禁止法幣流通。移交白銀等經濟問題、則日英兩方意見俄然對立、前途如何完全不能預測、據英方主張、經濟問題與本國方針有關聯、其性質與治安問題完全不同、因此有田克萊琪兩人之間成立諒解之一般原則、不應包含經濟問題、然日陸軍當局對於經濟問題、實關心極大、認此問題爲今次會談之中心的重要部份、禁止法幣流通、移交白銀等經濟問題實為中國治安問題之根本的要因、是以經濟問題不能解决、則治安問題不得解决、日方必以此兩問題一齊解决、絕對反對分別解决、津案談判即因此而致全而的决裂亦听不惜、（二十九日同盟社電）</p>
<p>（東京）關於日英會談中未决之主要部分治安問題、工部局反日華職員之革除、禁止法幣在租界內使用、及華方現銀交出等問題、現正在雙方對峙之中、將於三十一日之第六决會談時解决之、惟日英二國間之代表為使會談時便利起見、於二十九日午前各各舉行個別會談、企圖打開僵局、如日方之現地軍代表武藤少將於該日午前十時至英國大使館訪問克萊琪大使、別各脫少將哈伯持領事等作一小時半之懇談、又田中領事太田中佐大田少佐等亦於同日在外務决官之邸、參商應抱態度、又午前十一時哈伯脫領事至外務决官之邸作私人之訪問、又加藤公使克萊琪大使亦於午前十時四十分在東京俱樂部作密切之談話、山此觀之、可見日英二國間代表往來之頻繁、預料三十一日之第六次日英會議中、將有相當發展、（二十九日同盟社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於克萊琪爵士就英日談判情形向政府提出之報告、外務部當於週杪加以研究之後儘於下星期一之前以新訓令電達克萊琪、作為賡績進行談判之方針、（二十九日海通電）</p>
<p>（東京）關於英日談判、英方代表克萊琪爵士拒絕接受日方所提出之天津英租界禁用法幣曁移交存銀兩項要求之後、此間今晨各報咸以尖銳語調、加以抨擊、日本軍界人士認為倘英國此種堅持態度不變、則英日談判勢必陷於完全停頓、日本政界人士申稱、日本所提出之經濟要求乃維持東亞秩序之基本初步條件英方必須加以接受、不然乃違反克萊琪有田初步協定之精神、（二十九日海通電）</p>
<h3>經濟問題提交　小委員會討論</h3>
<p>（東京）此間日人各界以為關於天津問之英日談判、進行縱不順利、然尙良好雙方代炎今日會分別談話、因此結果、决定將經濟問題提交一種委員會、定星期一日午前九時集議、英方商務參贊麥克萊興天津領事赫伯特、將為此委員會之英方代表、而代表日方者、將為天津總領事田中、及外務省秘書靑木與淺香二人、據日方消息、天津反英公民協會、因東京談判進行迂緩、漸形不耐、巳定星期一日正午在天津某兩處召集反英大會、擬在街中游行而集合於英領事館之四周、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）關於成為日英會談難關之禁止法幣流通問題及現銀移交問題、加藤公使二十九日與克萊琪英大使協議結果决定由日英雙方選出精通現地事情之小委員、使之適應實際情形、作某礎的討論、俾獲得圓滿之妥協、該小委員會人選、日方已决定由田中彥藏領事朝海浩一郎及靑木盛夫兩外務事務官、共三名充任、英方則山哈佛脫領事馬科萊商務參事官兩名充任、（二十九日同盟電）</p>
<h3>英對兩項要求　無權單獨解決</h3>

<h3>紀念中國的摯友</h3>
<p>— 韓寗鎬博士　趙爾謙</p>
<p>韓寗鎬博士，（Dr　Henninghaus）於本月二十日在山東　州逝世，本市各西文報紙如二十五日的字林西報，二十六日的法文上海日報，以及二十三日的德文遠東新聞報，均一致撰文追悼，調其人格髙超，功在此邦，諷誦之餘，感慨彌深。當此舉國努力，建國復興工作之際，正需要一種埋頭苦幹，　而不捨，鞠躬盡瘁，死而後已的精神，以為天下侶，不意此老竟棄吾人而長逝，追懷既往，興念將來，在盛夏中，草此短文，用以紀念這位摯愛中國的外人。</p>
<p>我記得是一九三十年的夏天，筆者正在瑞士佛里堡大學讀書，時常和一班國際學生廝混，就中以一位德國同學為最熟，因為這裏是一座小型的國際的聯盟會，那一國人都有，但無國際界限和戰爭。在一個座談的茶會上，右側的小佛里慈剛從德國回來，拿出一張潔白的名片來給我，上書「韩寗镐，山东　州府。」反面有「專誠拜竭，不作別用」八字。在我的驚奇的視綫中，佛里慈藹然的對我說：「暑中我在南德國旅行，和這位老者相逢，他是中國由　州府的主教，居華久而熱愛中國，聽見我說遙裏有中國學生，讓我持片致候，因為要趕回中國去，不然的話，定要來此一遊」。我就隨手把名片珍藏起來，在下意識中，我的態度是他既「姑妄言之，我亦姑妄聽之，」因為我是無名小卒，無庸大人物來「專誠」，來「拜謁」。我意佛里慈又施詭計，不知從那里拿張名片來打混，不意四年以後，我竟和韓寗镐博士隸屬於同一教育機關，這不是緣緣堂主人豐子愷先生之所謂「緣」麼？</p>
<p>韓寗镐博士在中國的中心事業，計有兩端，一為教育，一為宗教，教育事業，以北平輔仁大學為核心，宗教事業，以栽植國產神職班和樹立本國教會為最後目標，茲得分別言之：</p>
<p>韓主教之重視男女教育，在山東教區內，遍立各級學校，無俟　述，這裏所要說的，是他和輔仁大學的關係，及其對於髙等教育的主張和計劃。他是聖言會的重要主教之一，與胡適·張繼·馬相伯·翁文　等同為輔仁校董，對於校務，髙瞻遠囑，多籌劃，而輔仁近二年之發展，尤足稱述．歷史家是嚴肅的，正確的，在輔仁校務述要欄內，有這樣的紀載，「本校為羅瑪教廷創辦，初委託美國本篤會，民國十四年成立輔仁社，旋擴充為輔仁大學，二十二年改委聖言會接辦，茲將二十六七兩年度展拓大要列左：一開辦文理科研究所，本校為謀大學畢業生要求髙深學問起見，擬開辦文理科兩研究所，二十六年春籌備完竣，呈部備案，旋於是年六月奉令准予開辦，二十六年度先成立文科史學部，二十七年度添立理科物理部，研究生共二十二人，二添招女生，二十六年三月本校以國幣十九萬九千元購置舊恭王府，十餘年來之校舍問題至是暫可解決。乃於二十七年九月添招文教兩院各系及理學院數理學系教學組一年級女生，以該府東部撥作女部校舍，由聖神會修女管理。</p>
<p>上述的數字，是說明無數的物力·才力·精力·犧牲在這座大學上，同時亦說明成功匪易，創業維艱，整個大學，是在困苦艱難中奮鬥而長成的。每一次的展拓，均得韓校董的鼓勵和推動，而物質和道德方面之贊助，尤足珍貴，故輔仁之得有今日，寗可謂非韓氏領導之功？福煦大將於歐戰終了後，曾發以下驚人的議論，足供從事教育者的參考，他說：「從前我的格言是知識居首，良心次之，這句話現在仍然用得著，不過我更喜歡說：良心居首，知識次之。是的，良心第一，這是最關緊要的。」我意韓寗镐和福煦具有同感，他把大學的教育基礎，築在良心和道德上面，以為教育是平行的，理智訓練，固然要緊，而道德教育，使得每個理智動物，養成完美髙尚的人格，豈不是更形重要。自蘆溝橋事變以來，輔仁仍為獨特的學府，在驚濤巨浪中，屹然未動，和燕京大學，同被視為「魯殿靈光」，原因固然眾多，而牠的教育基礎是道德的，當然是最充分的解釋之一。在今日學府化為兵營，禮堂權作馬　之秋，於滿城風雨中，猶聞　歌不輟之聲，數千學子，幸告無恙，此誠異　，懷念先賢，創業維艱，撫今思昔，不覺泫然矣。</p>
<p>一九二六年前教宗庇護十一世親手祝聖中華六位主教於羅瑪，一變舉世觀感，懷疑國產教會和國產神職班有存在之可能者，均已不復置疑。蓋傳教士之目的，不在於永久傳教，而在乎培養國產神職班，庶幾國產教會，確立於本土，能夠根深蒂固，穩定不搖，自養自給，成為獨立教區，不復需要外來的援助。我們現在試探討韓主教傳教的成績，便可知道他把教宗的意旨，字字施諸實行的。現在　州教區內有教友十六萬六千餘人，望道者得七萬四千餘人，而國藉司鐸由韓主教親自祝聖因登神品者，計有四十餘人之多，最近復劃教區一部，組織國藉教區，由田主教及中國司鐸主持。凡此種種措施，深得羅瑪宗座的贊許，特於一九三二年，趁韓主教慶祝金慶的機會，命為御前侍衛主教，從此韓氏遂為教廷要員之一，此種榮譽的遷陞，在天主教方面，誠為不可多得的異數。同時德國明斯特大學以韓氏有功於教務及著作，特贈以榮譽的神學博士學位，從此人多以韓博士稱之。（未完）</p>

<h3>有人建議工部局　發行一種新滬幣　其計畫係以英金爲基礎　各主意見認爲困難孔多　華人均擁護法幣</h3>
<p>字林報云、有建議工部局應發行價値八便士的滬幣之計劃者、已引起衆人之熱烈議論、或予贊同、或加反對、記者頃向本埠航運商業與銀行界調查、所總叩詢之人、多贊成此項行動、惟關於此項計劃之確切實行一節、則意見大有參差、</p>
<p>邀集專家　從事研討</p>
<p>記者昨日（廿八日）叩　本埠某重要進出口商行之經　、據稱、此爲偉大之見解、余甚樂見此計劃之實行、惟恐在專門方面而言、不能發行新貨幣耳、此計劃之意義、顯然將使吾人有以英金爲根據之一種貨幣、然吾人今處金融現局之紛亂中、得不寗取此種新貨幣乎、衆皆以「然」爲答、故余希望專家從速會集、不稍延宕、而設法使此種更變實現云、</p>
<p>納稅人民　必加反對</p>
<p>工部局某員晤記者稱、據渠私見、上海貨幣、有益於工部局之福利、但局方縱所樂聞、納稅人將加反對無疑、因大多數納稅人之收入爲法幣、而滙率八便士之新幣、適使彼等所納稅額增加一倍也，記者問、然法幣續跌、而工部局之契的、多以英鎊計算、得不亦有此損失乎、該員答稱、如法幣續跌、或將如此、然余非專家、若專家決定此項計劃可付實行、則余認爲此乃偉大之見解也、</p>
<p>航商認爲　便利運費</p>
<p>某航商於被詢此事答稱、以英錢爲根據之新貨幣、有利於渠之航運公司、終且裨益大衆、目前該公司之運費、係以港幣結算、致該公司顧客不得不購亦以英金爲根據之港幣、該商之結語、問曰、是則能使該公司辦事大爲簡單之滬幣、何爲將產生不能克服之困難乎、</p>
<p>製藥商係　爲已設想</p>
<p>某製藥商亦盛贊建議中之新幣、據稱、目前、渠迫不得已而以英金定其所製藥價、而於出售時按照匯兌市價、將英金折成顧客所付之法幣、渠所得法幣、不克兌　　、而匯率或續跌、結果虧折等事、或將發生云、</p>
<p>銀行家言　必遭反對</p>
<p>記者繼以此事叩諸本埠某銀行高級人員、據稱、此意於實行時若不遭中日各界之反對、則甚佳妙、然現有法幣數萬萬元流通滬上、君意此鉅大數額如何能兌換之乎、工部局決不能自行發行此種貨幣、而須由一大銀行爲之、余確信如中日政府不加反對、此間較大的銀行之一、準備稍加考慮、而發行新幣、余覺雖將遭遇若干不便、然至少就外僑而言、得益於此種貨幣者當匪鮮淺云、</p>
<p>多數華人　依賴法幣</p>
<p>據另一熱此項計劃、決不能實行一說、並無根據、蓋即使大多數華人依賴法幣、但彼等除納稅水電與所需入口貨、而必須出較高價格者以外、並不受甚大之影饗、渠主張文刻成立專家委員會、並希望儘可能不稍延遲而發行新幣</p>
<p>某商人未　表示意見</p>
<p>又據上海主要商人之一聲稱、渠對此意見、未多思索、然記者叩以解決目前此間危急的金融問題之更佳辦法、則稱、渠非專家、不能應命、</p>
<h3>英兵四人被　日軍扣留</h3>
<p>經長官交涉後　歷三小時釋回</p>
<p>北江西路近靶子路口會佈有鐵絲網、以示禁止交通、同時在靠北面駐有日兵崗位、而北江西路一帶、則爲英兵防區、故在南端亦有英兵駐守、昨日下午四時半左右、英駐軍方面會有卡車一輛、搭載英兵四名、駛經鐵絲網地方、不知如何、忽與該處之日哨兵發生言語誤會、而該軍用車以及英兵四名、因各不相讓、爲日哨兵扣去、當時情形、頓見緊張、旋經雙方長官會談後、乃始氷釋、軍用車與英兵四名遂於傍晚七時左右、駛回英軍營、</p>
<h3>日人小川被　丁部擊斃</h3>
<p>在柘林東北</p>
<p>上海特務機關奉賢班警務指導官日人小川若雄、於本月廿六日、在奉賢柘林東北道院鎭附近、突爲華方游擊隊丁鍚山部數十人襲擊、當時小川等曾與丁部作戰、結果小川當塲受傷斃命、迨柘林方面日警備隊得訊往援、丁部已飄然引退、日方乃將小川屍身於二十七日運滬、昨日下午五時、日方特在乍浦路西本願寺舉行吿別儀式、僞「上海市長一傅筱庵等　均往參加、</p>
<h3>綸昌工潮　僵持如故</h3>
<p>工人勢將斷炊　情景異常悽慘</p>
<p>浦東英商綸昌紡織廠罷工風潮、蔓延兩月、因廠方態度嚴正、對非工友本身之無理條件、拒不接受、故僞方仍難解決、一般工人前圖自動進廠復工、被阻未成、僞方並稱願意源源發給救濟費、以維生活、詎目下因經濟困難、已有多時未發、致工人均有斷炊之處、情景異常悽慘、</p>
<h3>兆豐公園銅樂會</h3>
<p>工部局音樂隊定於卅日下午五時半至七時（如天氣良好）、在兆豐公園內舉行銅樂會、節目計有七項、</p>
<h3>佳訉頻傳　金融市塲愈穩　外滙繼續放長　證券漲黃金降</h3>
<p>自美國廢止美日商約後、蘇聯貸款一萬五千萬美金、一般認爲國際局勢將轉變、與中國抗戰前途有益、於是上海金融市塲轉好穩定、謠言全息、人心安定、茲由新聲社記者向市塲探得詳情於下、（一）外匯黑市英商匯豐銀行掛脾雖爲英匯四辦士、美匯七元七五、但實際行市已繼續放長、計英匯四辦士三七五、美匯八元五六二五、掉期套利、已由一角外步减至七分、（二）黃金暗市昨晨開做後、因黑市外匯轉鬆、因此跌勢甚劇、收盤爲三千五百九十五元、銀行掛牌降至三百六十五元、新同行爲三百六十三元、（三）證券暗市、昨晨開拍後、一致猛漲、計統一甲丁戊各漲四角、乙種八角、丙種六角、（四）匯劃貼水、巳趨穩定、昨日爲二百五十元左右、與前日相仿、無甚變動、</p>
<h3>統一公債本息　準明日起付款　滬分六期將以滙劃付給　命令預定今明必可到滬</h3>
<p>自淪陷區域各海關稅收被截後、財政部對關稅担保各債、規定此後償付辦法、即不再予以透支、於是七月底到期統一公債本息、被迫暫行停付、惟中中交農四行爲安定市面計、巳允貼現抵借、由重慶十足付款、上海以及各埠分六期付淸、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>重慶一次　上海六期</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向中央銀行探悉、關於七月三十一日到期之統一公債第七决本息、中中交農四行已允貼現抵借、辦法內定重慶總行十足一决付款、上海以及各埠、則分六期付淸、每期爲一個月、付款手續與第六决略同、惟「准匯憑證」改爲「貼現憑證」、該上海分行對付款手續、已準備就緒、俟奉總行電令後、即行實行、</p>
<p>將以匯劃　票據付給</p>
<p>關於付款之電令、截至昨晚止、尙未到滬、預定今日或明晨決能到滬、明日（即三十一日）決能如期辦理貼現抵借付款、但是項付劃頭（即現鈔）抑付上海通用之匯劃、尙未奉總行命令、惟預料係付匯劃票據、付款機關、爲中央·中國·交通·等三銀行、統一本息總數爲五千六百六十萬零三千五百元、</p>
<p>統一公債　昨日猛漲</p>
<p>上海證劵暗市、因美廢止美日商的及蘇聯鉅額借款成功後、統一各債猛漲、昨日收盤行市如下、（一）甲種五十四元、漲四角、（二）乙種四十五元一角、漲八角、（三）丙極四十三元二角、漲六角、（四）丁種四十二元三角、漲四角、（五）戊種四十二元六角五分、漲四角、</p>
<h3>高冠吾　又遇狙擊</h3>
<p>兇手安然逃脫</p>
<p>南京「維新政府市長」高冠吾、一度在日領事館宴會席上飲酒中毒、二十六日晨該高「市長」途經夫子廟地方、叉遭一彪形大漢狙擊、連續開放七八鎗之多、該大漢見目的已達、安然逃脫、開事後在城南某旅社被拘獲一嫌疑犯、</p>
<h3>拘獲暴徒後　租界搜檢加嚴　楊姓男子昨未解法院　案情嚴重須縝密偵查</h3>
<p>本埠中美日報、日前會收得有十九封之恐嚇信、限令該報各重要職工、務於三日內離職、並許以離職後、當有乾薪可領吾則將往各人之住處暗殺之、而各人之住址、亦在該信上註明之、現聞捕房方面、對此恐怖運動、巳大加防備、故中美日報之館址、已有多數之便捕保護、以備不測、而在該館前之愛多亞路上、且不許有汽車之停留、又在大晚報與太陸報及泰晤士報之交界處、特派有巡捕一名、常川駐守、</p>
<p>抄出手槍　逮捕多人</p>
<p>在昨日（二十八日）下午四時四十五分間、該捕忽見有一人身着洋裝、手提一包、甚爲重累、乃亟飭將電梯停止、加以逮捕、啟視其包內、則果赫然盒子砲兩枝、子彈四百粒也、該匪徒被捕後、即被送往中央捕房、訊問之下、諉稱此乃自衛之用、嗣經嚴詰、乃謂彼乃大陸報附近之某公司職員、因此之故、該公司之全體職工、昨經均加以逮捕、</p>
<p>暴徒計畫　灼然可見</p>
<p>依捕房方面推測、則該公司之窗口、可以望及中美日報之編輯部、而該處且有一小弄、即前星期暴擊案之發生所在也、據該匪徒等之意、似欲在窗口放槍、或從小弄侵入該報館、而行兇以後、小弄雖被捕房所封閉、但匪徒則固可從大陸報之門、棄槍而逸云、又訊、茲據滬光社記者探悉本案犯人楊某、昨晨並未解送特一院審理、捕房尙在嚴密偵訊中、某西文報載解案不確、</p>
<p>上週鉅案　震動一時</p>
<p>自上星期六晚愛多亞路長耕里中美日報及大晚報突被暴徒襲擊、致發生探捕與匪大格鬥、死傷人數、竟遠二十餘名、雖經捕房於事後弋獲嫌疑人沈玉飛等七名、解送特一法院訊押在案、各情已誌本報、但此决舉動、顯屬爲有組織計劃之大規模行動、故爲防範再發起見、特由捕房在各報館所在地左近、嚴加戒備、</p>
<p>拘獲男子　帶入捕房</p>
<p>乃前日下午四時四十五分前、突有一楊姓男子、手持一紙包、形色慌張、入愛多亞路一百六十號泰晤大樓、正在等候電梯上樓之際、爲該大樓司閣捕等查覺其形跡可疑、遂上前查抄、當在該男子所持之紙包內、抄出手槍二支、子彈多粒、帶入捕房、據供係至該樓三百十九號房間大豐報關行者、經探嗣往調查、在大豐內抄獲來福槍一支、子彈多粒、</p>
<p>尙在偵查　未解法院</p>
<p>據大豐人員言、該楊姓男子、向在該報關行內租一寫字檯、經營報關事務、後又經探員等拘獲與此案涉有嫌疑之人犯徐某一名、現正在嚴密偵查、故昨晨並未解送特一法院審理、至該楊姓等二人、是吾與襲擊中美日報等一案有關、抑另與他案有關、現因捕房方面正嚴予密查中、故尙難探悉、</p>
<p>英法當局　同時搜檢</p>
<p>昨日正午十二時許、公共租界捕房及法租界捕房同時在愛多亞路之南北端遣派大批探捕、搜查行人、允以公共租界愛多亞路廣西路口、法租界愛多亞路西自來火街口爲甚、法捕房且以砲車一輛、停駐該處、施行戒備、但未聞有所獲得、</p>

<h3>投機囤戶脫售　昨日米價狂跌　上中决粳秈米樣入市　浦東早稻新粳已抵滬</h3>
<p>租界當局爲賡續辦理民食調節平衡、减輕市民負祖起見、特進行調查各棧存米、查報貨主、分發通知後、業由各棧遵照塡報、已於昨日藏事、一俟審核完竣、即再直接通知各貨主、迅將棧米、依照每石白粳二十元、客秈十六元之限價內、交易出售、如故意遷延時日、或用頂名過戶等流弊、一經查出、決予嚴懲不貸、</p>
<p>市價回跌　交易增加</p>
<p>米業市塲連日情形、頗爲混亂、等於有行無市之停頓狀態、幸經兩租界當局聯合澈查棧米後、一般企圖操縱市面之投機囤戶、大起恐慌、亟欲脫售過戶、免遭意外、故昨晨市塲開市後、上中决各路粳秈米樣包、入市甚多、市塲如「久早逢甘雨」、現貨籌碼靈活、買賣雙方交易劇增、市價因此回跌、現頭號白粳已進二十元關內、客秈行市亦回縮至十五元六七角、</p>
<p>年成豐收　早稻登塲</p>
<p>滬市存米、因產地國米、被日僞方面非法禁止出境、致各帮運商無法販運、來源阻斷、故當局正在鼓勵各行商恢復販運並設法疏禁、以彌不足、正値此際、而各地早稻均告豐收、據大光社記者探悉、浦東早稻新粳、年產的十萬石、今年除沿海區略受風災損失外、其餘各區、均收成特佳、產量不亞於往年、現第一批新米樣、昨已携入市塲兜售、開價十八元八角、特號破　米十九元、此外如江陰之黃塘·峭岐·祝塘、皖省之蕪湖等處早稻粳秈、亦於八月初或八月底可相繼登塲、據稱本年因氣候適宜、故能豐收、</p>
<p>來源增暢　絕無恐慌</p>
<p>內地各產區國米、雖經日僞方面禁止出境、但各行商及販商據理力爭、設法疏運、故近日來源數量、較前增暢、昨日由京滬綫車運來滬者、計有五車、由水路來滬的一千二百餘包、合計到滬米糧、總的三千餘包、現下存糧雖不多、惟各地早稻登塲、且內地底存陳米來源日見暢旺、故今後民食、可絕無恐慌之虞、</p>
<h3>盛傳日商　强用僞幣</h3>
<p>二萬儷工將受影響　蘇州河南絕不接受</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、盛傳在滬西經營之日本實業商、刻正考慮以華興票付給僱工、惟以何種比率計算、則未知之、按公共租界蘇州河南岸並不接受華興票、若此項計劃實施、將有二萬僱工受其影響、</p>
<h3>颶風轉變方向　滬可免襲</h3>
<p>氣候不類伏暑　時疫必須預防</p>
<p>太平洋兩颶風、據徐家匯天文台探悉、第一新颶風、昨晨六時、進抵北緯二十六度、東經一百四十六度後、即呈滯留狀態、或有消滅」可能、第二颶風、昨日午後二時、已進抵北緯二十四度、東經一百三十度之處、因其方向已轉北北東、故上海已可免被襲、至本埠氣候、仍極凉快、不類伏暑、故一般均料秋季中或將酷熱、若然、則今年時疫、必須預防、即以目前各時疫醫院投診病人而言、每日平均、在一千名以上、僅上海時疫醫院一處、每日門診、巳逾五百號、上海市民所受健康威脅、極爲顯著、</p>
<h3>沿長江一帶　游擊隊架大砲　將開始與日軍周旋　日發言人明白承認</h3>

<h3>日軍在津　阻撓外輪</h3>
<p>假名檢查疫症　百般阻碍外輪</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今料自上海與香港駛往天津之沿海航輪、將大受延遲、因日軍下令、命旅客須在海河口之大沽受虎疫檢查也、天津航運公司已提出强硬抗議、反對此令、並指稱、此令係日軍而非任何文官當局所發、世上任何港口、均未宣布上海或香港爲</p>
<p>虎症傳染</p>
<p>之港、此種檢查、絕非必要、據航運界人士聲稱、截至今日爲止、法租界本年並無虎疫、而公共租界僅有一起、虎疫迭起、而確成流行症者、始得宣布該港爲「虎疫傳染」、而下令施以特別檢查、再、邇來旅客均須</p>
<p>備防疫證</p>
<p>則旅客之不致傳染、又得一保障、目前日軍此令自八月一日起實行者、絕不致查出傳染虎疫之旅客、衆乃認此爲阻障在華外國利益之另一步驟、據航運公司預料、船隻抵大沽、將延遲二至</p>
<p>五日之久</p>
<p>而使船期大起紊亂、本年赴北方諸港消夏者、不乏其人、船隻在津延期、將使避暑者之行止程序混亂、至少遇不便利、且頗有遇困難之可能、</p>
<h3>滬溫通航　暫難實現</h3>

<p>滬昆聯運</p>
<p>滬浙閩間航運一度完全、中斷、致往來內地客貨、集中海防、繞道昆明、轉入內地、航業界爲便利客貨運、實施滬昆聯運、取道越南西貢、日前曾有法郵船斐力斯羅山而號、裝運貨物數百噸、實行聯運、滬上已接電告、安全抵達、費時僅十餘日、現客貨運輸更見繁榮、</p>

<h3>開封英敎士廿人　遭威脅後退出　反英運動經鼓動後爆發　日軍公然命敎士等速離　惟美籍敎士未遭妨礙</h3>
<p>大陸報云、昨（二十八日）據本埠披露消息、英籍敎士、約二十人、上週被最激烈之惆嚇、逐出開封、而行抵靑島、彼等之華籍工作人員、亦遭同樣恫嚇、此事雖尚未悉詳情、然本埠人士以爲僅最可驚人之局勢始能逐此輩英人出城、因一年前彼等且願在日軍侵佔時忍受被侮辱之危險也、昨日上海首决接獲</p>
<p>確實退出</p>
<p>之消息、據稱、開封英人遭遇日方統制的傀儡政權所造成酷似義和團初起時之局面、迫不得已而迅速離去、反英情緒、經數日之鼓動後、七月七日發生危局、憤恚之暴衆、包圍英國兩敎會、（中國內地敎會與加拿大教會）、此兩團體皆多女性工作人員、屋外被圍以障礙物、食物飮水供給、均遭截斷、暴衆發言人令敎士於二十四小時內離城、聞當先襲擊者、</p>
<p>係回敎徒</p>
<p>此爲最可怪之點、若輩語敎會華籍工作人員、謂彼等若與愧儡團體相聯絡、則每月當給予十元至十二元之報酬、然敎會華籍工作人員雖深恐被施報復、仍立加拒絕、暴動遂繼以發生、兩敎會領袖立即往日駐軍司令部、抗議日軍准許城中暴動、而不加干涉、駐軍司令則答曰、甚爲關切、將加調查、該司令片刻即返、調此事甚危險、若等以離城爲佳、吾人不能控制若輩之</p>
<p>反英情緒</p>
<p>云、後事如何、尚未知之、然教士一行、立即裝束就道、乘隴海路火車至徐州、復抵靑島、足證暴動之嚴重性質、學校·管理處·敎堂·與職員宿舍、均被迫退出、而無人看守、即中國內地敎會之敎堂看守人、亦被迫走、今此價値數十萬元之敎會產業、命運未下、惟美國南方浸禮敎會之海列斯醫師可望向愧儡政府施加若千勢力、促偽政府或准美敎會保護此等產業、中國內地敎會醫院、</p>
<p>規模宏大</p>
<p>約有外籍醫生五人、及外籍看護數人、被暴衆迫令於數小時內撤退病人百餘、其甲若干甫離手術室、自該城被佔以來、由兩敎堂辦理之難民大收容所中之難民、諒必已甚爲窘困、蓋暴衆致最後通　之後、此等收容所及所內學校中之難民均已撤退也、聞敎士無身受傷害者、彼等僅携較貴重之物離城、瀕行、暴衆告敎士曰、決不准英人復入、開封爲敎會活動之中心地者、已歷八十年以上、昨日抵滬之消息又稱、英人退出前、大批美籍敎士均未遭妨碍、</p>

<h3>貨船數艘　黃渡附近被扣</h3>
<p>二十八日下午四時許、有內地返滬小火輪拖帶民船數艘、駛至黃渡附近、遭受襲擊、貨船數艘致被扣留、小火輪經檢查後、即獲放行、西行航班爲避免危險、均减班或停航、二十九日本有蘇州無錫朱家角等班，均臨時展期、現北新涇一帶河面、時有武裝日軍乘汽艇往來巡邏、檢查船艘、</p>
<h3>錢業鉅子　裴卿氏的風格</h3>
<p>— 雨齋</p>
<p>裴雲卿先生是浙江上虞崧厦鎭的望旅，凡是到過崧厦的人，祇要一提起他老人家，就都會點着頭由心底裏說出一聲「好」來。這並不是件偶然的事，要不是他平日關懷故鄕，嘉惠桑梓，决不會有這樣口碑的。那裏十足是一個中世紀典型的小鄉鎭，沒有舶來氣息的沾染，也絕少現代裝飾的點綴，樸實的民風和惇厚的習尚，薰陶成裴先生現在澹泊的生活。一件灰布長掛兒，是他的常服，也是他最隆重的禮服。直到現在，他還是包車一輛，每逢有人勸他備一輛汽車以代步時，他總是微笑地搖搖頭說：一謝謝你，我平日素尚實際，不務虛表，現在還沒有感到有坐汽車的必要呢！」他自奉的儉的；於此可見一般。</p>
<p>記得是端午那天，我收到他一張請柬，屆時如的前往，被邀者大都是較有聲望的，他鄭重地邀請我們入席，却見桌上祇排着五葷五素很普通的菜餚，這不由得使座上客多少感到些驚異，以爲這樣一個隆重的宴會，菜餚竟會這般簡單，也許講究人家的家常便飯，眞會比這精緻得多。可是結果大家到底被他偉大的人格所感動了，覺得這一次歡　，此較吃那些山珍海　，着實滋味得多</p>
<p>他今年已經是年將花甲的人了，兩鬢雖呈斑白，可是看去還已足像一備中年人，我從浚有見過他一分鐘曾表示過老態，這就是說他無論在什麼時候，無論處理什麼事情，總是全神貫注着，從沒有過精神渙散或萎靡的表示。我曾欽佩地向他說過：「您老的精神，眞够人佩服，所謂老當益壯，可說當之無愧。」而他的答語是：「老？着實還早着呢，事實和責任昭示着我們，不容我們不鼓足精神去從事。精神是一切工作的動力，實際，祇要你抓得住事業的興趣，和了解責任的重要，精神自然就會跟着你跑的。」</p>
<p>他旅滬已經四十四年，出身僅僅是一個錢莊的學生，他抱定但求耕耘不問收獲的態度，堅苦奮鬥了好幾十個年頭，造成了現在本埠錢業一人的地位。他常常運用彈性的外交方式來應付外來艱巨的工作，待人接物，公正不欺，而對於自身的操守，輕易不肯放鬆。孝弟忠信，禮義　恥，這是他造就人格的條件。而不嫖不賭，尤其是連烟捲兒都不染，更是難能可貴。御下一本人格感化，決不自欺欺人，他的論理，以舊道德爲出發點，而以新道德爲歸宿，熔新舊道德於一爐。在他那佈置得很簡單可是很有意味的辦公室裏，甚至他職員的辦公室裏，都可以發現一條條觸目警惕的格言，標語。他叉爲挽救世風的頹蕩，特地印就一種「護身格言」的小冊，分送大衆，他的苦心孤詣，槪可想見。</p>
<p>一個錢業領袖的會客，常常是非常忙的，前天我想去訪問他，先給了他一個電話，詢問他什麼時候最便當，而他的回答是每日早上七點鐘，我着實懷疑，懷疑也許我是聽錯了，因爲在上海，早上七點鐘去拜訪一位有聲望的朋友，實在是希有的事。所以在昨天早晨六時五十分，坐上車子，轉念一想，恐怕太早，臨時改變方向，向滬西去吸些新鮮空氣，繞了一個大圈子，再到他辦公　時，錶上正指着七時二十五分，誰知一跑進去，室中早坐着三位客人，並且在作終結的談話了。我不由得暗地說了聲慚愧，雖然並不是我有意爽的，可是至少我是還沒能澈底了解他。</p>
<p>桌上凌亂地堆着許多文件，道告訴我他在那時已辦了不少的公事。他說：一因爲早上頭腦比較淸醒些，所以有許多事情，我都是在早上辦的，司時也讓鑑德可以學習學習辦事。」</p>
<p>鑑德君是裴先生的大公郞，現在任職中一信託公司，勤儉樸實，大有乃父風，深得上峯器重，每晨九時以前還帮着先生辦事，眞所謂是克紹箕裘了。</p>
<p>先生癖荷，辦公室外佈置着一個很精緻的花圃，雜栽各色花卉，正中端放着一隻荷缸，缸裏玉立着幾枝荷花，臨風招展，越顯得他的淸高。明凈的朝露，銀珠般滾來滾去，我幻想到橫在他根部的一段雪藕，出汚泥而不染，眞是先生最確切的象徵。</p>
<p>裴先生就是這樣一個典型人物：「他的年齡是時代的落伍者，他的事　是跟着時代急起直追，而他的思想和行動，却時時站在時代的前面。」</p>
<p>我對於第墨，荒疎已久了，因爲裴先生修養功夫的感召，得着一個深刻的印象，所以隨便寫一點，介紹於讀者。</p>

<h3>金融　遠期外滙了結殷切　掉期因之遂見軋攏</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、仍無變動、英美匯暗市、因國際問新局勢、更有利於中國、中俄又有巨額貸款成立之訊、致兩星期來陰霾重重之外匯市塲、昨日豁然開朗各方人心已大見安定、投機家無其操縱故技、初開洋行與難扒、無如外行賣意濃厚、致市勞甚穩、嗣後孟買銀公司及西商沙遜並華商投機家等均競相出範、尤以八月期了結愈切、故八月期市勢較現貨更鬆、掉期因之遂見軋攏、照午收銀行賣價、英金距離三七五、美匯相差七五、約合月息（除佣）九分四　光景、而套利者實際上祇有七分七八釐、致套利交易驟淸、半天交易、期貨居多、</p>
<p>期現一致鬆動</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近期長一八七五、遠期升一二五、紐的銀價呆定、倫教生金仍平、匯兌英對美小三毫、對滬跌二五、對法未更、美對英勿動、對滬大二角五分、對法長〇六二五、中央掛脾各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士三四三七五、美匯八元四三七五、校前收、英長〇三一二五、美硬〇六二五、開後日行與洋行雖相繼扒結、但因外行頗肯塞出、故市勢穩定、計日行正金首先結進外行現貨英金四辦士三七五、繼而洋行亦購結匯豐等各外銀行與某美行現貨英金四辦士三四三七五及現貨美匯八元四三七五、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉、悉無變動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉、依然免微、此後日行正金等、突想吐售、八月英金價由三辦士八一二五高至八七五、無如外行均無吃胃、致求聞成交、時孟買銀公司與西商沙遜及華商投機家等均來競相出籠、計塞予英行華比等八月份英金由三辦士九三七五、硬至四辦士〇六二五、並賣予大通。運通八月份美匯出七元七五長至八元、同時又吐予英行現貨英金四辦士三七五及四〇六二五、兼再塞予某行現貨美匯八元五六二五、致現期形勢均鬆、時已午刻、此後外行賣意亦濃、但成交沉寂、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士四三七五、美匯八元六二五、八月份英金四辦士〇六二五、美匯七元八七五、結果比上日現貨英鬆一二五、美硬二五、八月份尤鬆、午後週六無市、</p>
<h3>散多絡繹出籠　金價直下　當日變動已小　成交約七百兩</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、稍形平庸、惟趨勢尚飄忽不定、時上時下、使人殊難捉摸、但大宗心理帶疲者居多、蓋照目前政治局勢、美日商的廢止後、及英國之跟踪聲援以觀、對我國前途頗有轉危爲安之勢、加以一般經營者、預料英日談判恐有破裂之可能、故零星散戶多頭出籠、仍絡繹不絕、晨開出做低至三千六百二十元、嗣以證券帮忽趁低吸收、兼某金號代投機商亦來搜購、致市勢一度回高至三千六百七十元、後因外滙現期均硬、是以證券帮頓止進斬結、價遂重轉向下、延至午收竟退達當日低盤之三千五百九十五元、結果續跌百元、午後無正式行市、但塲外據聞潛勢轉堅、價已回上至三千六百二十元、上午交易零多躉少、的七百兩光景、銀樓飾金步跌十元、海關金與中英純金等仍乏變化、</p>
<p>烚赤再跌一百元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩），初開承上日之餘風未息、開市竟猛撳七十五元、錢兌業賣予金號十兩、價三千六百二十元、嗣證劵帮與某余號（代投機商）均前來吸收、雖某銀樓代殷富多頭出籠、奈頭寸仍感求過於供、市勢向上、立升五十元、某金號進錢兌業五十兩、及銀樓帮十兩、價均三千六百七十元、當日高峰、後因聞外滙現期均硬、人心頓虛、進者觀望、某錢兌業叉力塞數十兩、不久即步跌三十元、某錢兌業賣予證券帮四十兩、價三千六百四十元、時證券帮亦忽轉賣風、潛勢更疲、遂破入三千六百元大關、證劵帮賣予錢兌業五十兩、價三千五百九十瓦元、此後某金號復代投機商猛進百餘兩、一時售者頗缺、竞硬抬六十五元、某金號進錢兌業二十兩、價爲三千六百六十元、十一時半因外滙報硬、重又引起賣風、市勢復轉下疲、延至午刻、銀樓帮賣予錢兌業二十兩、價三千五百九十五元爲午收價、聞收後潛勢尚穩、三千六百元會有成交、午後因逢外滙週六無市、經同業議決停市半天、若照午收價三千五百九十五元、結果比隔昨續跌一百元、半天七十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價照烚赤較高十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、據詢極　成交、</p>
<p>首飾金掛小十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸三百七十五元、迨至九時四十八分掛小五元、十一時五十分叉掛低五元、此後未聞變動、計大同行改懸三百六十五元、新同行爲三百六十三元、收進約减十餘元至二十元不等、</p>
<p>中英純金無變化</p>
<p>二十八日倫敦電、英純金每盎斯仍屬七鎊八先令六辦士半致中央銀行之中國現金收買價仍爲一千二百十二元六角、掛牌海關金仍平、計二元三角九分六厘、上海標準標金價亦仍無變化、計一千二百零匕元九角、</p>
<h3>外幣再小　美金鎊跌三元</h3>
<p>昨日外幣因外匯續鬆、烚赤回跌劇烈、英美金鎊供給趨殷、市况鬆動、金票拋塞甚暢、需要减少、香港法郞等票紛粉下降、市上買進收藏者稀見、日金票未敢收存、供塞甚暢、市價跌四分許、晚市爲一元零七分、朝鮮票供求稀少、仍爲八角九分、公會交易、勤泰出同豐進法郎票二千個、羅比票一百五十元、永豐出福和祥進安南票三百元、咋日市價、英金鎊降一元五角、金票降一元四角、美金鎊降三元、金票降二角五分、香港票降五分、法郞票降三厘、新加坡票降一角、荷蘭票安南票各降五分、坎拿大票降五角、斐律濱票降三角、澳金票降一元八角、僅少數未更、</p>
<h3>貼現略升</h3>
<p>昨日匯劃票據貼現率、略見回升、每千元上午在二百五十五元左右盤旋、下午一度升至二百六十元、但不久即見回低至二百五十七元半、比前日升起二元半、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市仍掛二角未更云、</p>
<h3>印銀亦步高</h3>
<p>二十八日倫敦電、印度及投機家補空、少供給市面平、收盤後、印度照掛牌價高零六二五來問詢、但後未成交極稀、大條銀、近期長一八七五、遠期升一二五、紐的銀電、美現貨呆定如故、又孟買銀電、印銀市况堅穩、現貨漲六安那、期貨均昻九安那、成交單共計二百張云、</p>
<h3>證券　內債轉機</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况繼續良好、人氣已比較發揚、月餘來、陰霾之氣漸漸消散、美國自發表對日廢止美日商約協定後、幷有進一步之措施、更有蘇俄對中國鉅數貸款之傳說、可見雪中送炭竞尚有人、此種情形、在精神上日本頗受打擊、我國則不啻一服淸凉散、精神爲之大振、市塲萎靡之人心、頓爲興奮、買氣頓見濃厚、惟大戶尚有出籠、故所漲尚屬有限、惟暗中復叉提高一元、形勢已見好轉、本息已無問題、首途已有生機矣、昨日經過、開盤大豐聯益及卅八號頗有買進、惟廿號及六十四號仍有大量供給、故漲勢堅而不銳、後德孚及震康吃胃尚健、而同裕大通仍有出售、故結果祗略好四角至八角、收市後金子帮頗有需要、故暗中可高一元許、成交總數共計的七八十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、咋日無成交、衆業公所股票報告、，昨晨爲開始下週新交易、市氣絞佳、價格皆形見高、外匯稍穩定、因現貨與八月份之相差較小、市氣見好、亦此原因焉、爲此短期外滙套利、續行巨大、則有大般幣資將投入於外市、投資者受不利影響、</p>
<h3>糖市　漲跌互見</h3>
<p>昨糖市據倫敦電訊、微有升降、八月份升七五、爲七先令〇七五、十二月份六先令二辦士、明年三月份六先令二辦士七五、均小半辦士、公會劃盤二四粗白現貨小三角、本棧三十四元、外棧三十三元八角、轉口貨小二角半、爲廿五元六角半、太古車白叉升二三四角、B嘜東棧三十八元二角、西棧三十八元半、BC嘜三十八元二角、CX嘜三十七元八角、DY嘜三十七元四角、HHX嘜三十七元二角、荷赤現貨升四角、爲二十九元二角、轉口升一角、爲二十二元三角、本綿白小半元、振記一號三十三元半、二號三十三元、三號三十二元半、四號三十一元、國糖有潮帮開出綿赤百餘包、升至三十一元、新到油包海南赤二百七十五包、二十元、</p>
<h3>紗花　港滇暢銷冷門紗</h3>
<p>紗市先跌後回、但大致不脫徘徊之狀、至於棉紗成交量、雖未踴躍、但實際交易佔多數、因之人心穩靜、兼之內地帮素向採辦日紗爲主體者、近來華紗冷門貨價較爲便宜、商人之算盤、當以利益爲第一、冷門紗因此顯著一綫曙光之象、有人說華南港滇一帶、愛用國貨觀念殊深、將新廠之華紗推銷、因其貨價要賤七八十元至百元光景、何以專門傾尚一二種之紗牌、被人操縱而不放棄也、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、因昔日一般之恐怖流言、不攻自破、人氣大爲平靜、且各種投機工具、熱度一致降低、乃商塲上已趨安謐之途、投機成交較爲减少、二十支雙馬外棧貨開個爲五百五十五元、棧單價爲五百四十四元、跌去二三元不等、未幾聞外滙轉硬、賣聲稍震、再落三四元、二十支雙馬外棧價至五百五十元、棧單價五百四十一元、迨至收盤、聞內地帮對於本紗稍有需要、人心轉昂、又復回上幾元、查半日成交統計七百六十五包、行情無甚軒輊、廠方由永安廠開出、一十支特金城一百二十包、價爲六百四十元、由香港帮去、叉查棉紗今（三十日）有一千六百九十件、運往香港、又三百五十件運北海、九十件運海口、二十件運廣州灣、七百五十件運海防、茲將各帮買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　二二〇　內地　二〇〇</p>
<p>同行　三一五　厦門　一〇</p>
<p>統計　七六五　上日成交六六</p>
<p>日紗市面、因本月份軋空已過、市况和平、北方稍有需要、然洋行家方將一二種熱俏棉紗收進幾包、於是有一部份大爲吹毛求疵矣、二十支月琴現貨價爲四百三十元、</p>
<h3>印棉到貨日湧　洋行廉價出售　一個月後付款</h3>
<p>本棉生意、轉趨靜寂、惟美印棉日商大康廠稍有需要、採辦五百件、此貨皆係同業中轉輾售給現貨、華商榮豐廠進十支粗紗原料平果爾三百件、因法幣貼水旣昻、而銀根緊迫、祗得改購匯劃價格計算、因之本日成交較前兩日叉形减色、實緣金融緊縮所致、棉市前途、亦呈趦趄之狀態、蘇北來源叉復凋零、碼頭上到通花僅丸十八包、茲將現棉情形如左、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初較形活躍、先因利物浦及孟買來電高漲、同業交易亦甚衆多、一般預料最近之將來、日本因受美棉津貼之故、或將有採購美棉之說、但後因銀行界及國外拋賣者多、故價格略墜、結果收盤較之上日跌七至八磅音、印度連同預測漲一羅比餘、埃及漲十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、除日前因日廠存底微薄而略有廉價購進現貨印棉一二千件、惟付款條件則異常優待付款期均後在八月下旬云、日來到貨甚多、昨日又有印棉三千件運到、下月初將有大批擠到、</p>
<p>印棉不斷運來、大英公司貨船Nagpore號、自孟買運來棉花三千零九十一噸、原定今日抵滬、茲據該公司謂、該輪已提前終昨晨進口、停靠浦東其昌棧起卸、聞尚有一輪、亦山孟買運棉來滬、數量較昨日進口者略多、的下月四日可到、</p>
<h3>糧食　東新豐收　即將上市　蕪禁已開</h3>
<p>國米　浦東新粳業已在市出樣、惟貨品尚未抵埠、數祗二十五石、至於品質極優、據貨主言、今庚東新上市、較客歲爲早、逾前的半月之期、而年稔以氣候順利、有八成之豐穫、嗣後可源源運滬、時値米價混沌之際、有此佳昔、人心堪爲安慰，昨各路來源仍屬寥寥、車輪包子到一千餘包、市面依然均無出樣、所做開者仍祗十六元之拍米、與二十二元之變元二千四五百包而已、</p>
<p>客秈　昨日內地與行囤均未問津、統市祗本街各戶去二千包左右、惟蕪湖開禁已經決議實行、據傳加費二角、杭蘇等各地搬出證一律照發、祗上海一路尚未准許、但內地旣已通運、則以後滬存不致再被內地運銷、而內地存積之高檔粳尖、亦可轉輾赴申、因此人心向下、客囤競脫、大市機秈隨以十六元限盤售出、决秈十五元六七角、砶秈十五元三四角至十五元左右、比之前市相差達四五七八角不等、扯落四五角、洋米因客秈猛落、進戶均嫌昂、不再問訊云、</p>
<h3>麵粉廠盤　已達五元現鈔　猛漲一角五分</h3>
<p>現粉市况、漲風頗烈、二號粉廠盤已達五元現鈔、比前日匯升一角半、聞回籠貨亦已提高至四元九角現鈔、與廠盤相差一角、但市上回籠貨已感枯竭、亦屬無貨可購、咋日本客交易、尚稱活動、惟大帮去化、依然缺乏、蓋目下各粉廠生產减縮、不肯儘量供給也、統市成交共有三萬包光景、均係本客零星辦去、據業中人談論、際此百物昻漲聲中、粉價尚屬廉宜、故廠盤旣到五元之價、或能一度暫定云、</p>
<p>小麥市况、到銷兩少、市面尚覺挺立、因到貨均已上棧待機、且昨日粉市提升一角半、麥爲粉之原料、當然亦應提高、惟廠胃仍淡、雖有本街囤戶之問津、叉有擇巧而取之意、故市面未能過好、統市售開崑山·浦鎭·烏衣·南京等麥共一千一百餘包、價爲六元七角三分至四角八分、較前徵挺二三分、仍由囤戶方面辦去云、</p>
<h3>油餅　豆油頓吿暴挫　較最高價驟跌四五元　豆餅囤戶出籠價亦甩</h3>
<p>豆油　市况過度興奮、反因實銷不前、致行情殊難擯守、突告暴挫、昨市比較本月二十五日之最高價驟跌四五元、計共成交大連桶油二十桶、價爲四十七元、神戶來連油三十桶、價爲四十六元五角、查豆油昨由靑島運來一百五十件、又五百聽、生油亦來三百聽、今日有　油三百三十五聽運往香港、</p>
<p>豆餅　潛勢因銷塲漸告平淡、致大國戶亟謀出籠、故賣氣充溢、行情已甩進三元大關、計開大連源記餅三千片、價自二元九角三分、頻跌至二元八角四分、雜牌餅二千片、價爲二元八角半至二元八角二分、烟台餅一千片、價爲二元八角三分、</p>
<h3>疋頭　藍布客銷最盛　售盤漲過於跌</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>近日各客帮鑒於貨價堅昂、均　速購辦、故布疋遠近各路交易均有發展、藍布需要最盛、售盤漲三五角、白貨十六磅粗布漲二角半至五角、餘貨亦一致上騰、山東帮續購大生怡和十六磅粗布一百餘包、蘇北舉寗帮辦藍布等貨二千餘疋、滇帮辦色布印花色丁細斜漂布二千五百餘疋、南華航錢太古怡和二公司將於七月底起水脚改訂章程、每决按港幣繳費、與舊規須增三成之譜、故已定各貨趕速裝出、粤帮新添綫呢色布色斜條絨三千餘疋、南洋帮辦色素麻紗印花府綢藍布漂布二千餘疋、本街批發字號因杭州常州客戶添辦旺、進白貨粗布及色布等一百餘件、</p>
<p>東布</p>
<p>白貨細布細斜、昨市客銷岑寂、售盤平穩、龍頭細布現貨十五元三角、行方期貨亦無訂開、本街成交現期貨的三百餘包、市勢沉靜、</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>今日有布疋一千一百四十件、運往海防、又四十五件運廣州灣、十五件運北海、一百七十件運香港、</p>
<h3>法西襯突吿上升</h3>
<p>呢絨昨仍堅漲、法西襯亦告回漲、昨英製愛二七七牌子、躉批每碼俱漲至一元二角凈盤、國貨洪盛牌子爲七角算、華興鐵寳塔六角算、其他完全臘紗織成之什牌貨、統售五角四分、</p>
<h3>五金　白鉛皮開價已貴</h3>
<p>白鉛皮交易、至昨已有開出二三百桶之多、查去路爲本街電池廠·及印書房等、此外茶棧及香烟廠·玩具廠·亦有少數購去、海外定貨不多、本埠存底又薄、故執貨者之心思、均懷團積之念、開價較前漲達一百元光景、刻市如二號每桶售四百六十元、三號沽四百五十元、四號四百四十元、五號四百三十元、六號四百二十元、七號八號均開四百元、九號及十號開價則在四百四十元左右、其他厚花色須四百五十元到五百元、價格不一、而購辦者亦比薄花色僞稀、</p>
<h3>海味　寗子淡獻新</h3>
<p>寗子淡早經銷罄、市寂已久、首批新貨、始於最近有到、隨即售開、爲一百二十五元、茗大隻三四責及元淡須待秋間方出、暫乏行情、</p>
<h3>螟蜅貨缺市堅</h3>
<p>螟蜅近以到源稀少、市間頗感缺乏，而去路不衰、趨勢堅挺、刻市寗波蜅售三十元、比前升二元、提大者三十五元、存積更尠、殊爲俏利、</p>
<h3>南北貨　川榨菜來源復阻　價乃步升</h3>
<p>川榨菜前以漢口直接可來、會降至四十三四元、但邇來此路復告阻斷、價乃步升、現樂磧菜呌售七十元、陪陵菜六十元、</p>
<h3>煤炭　烟煤堅挺</h3>
<p>烟煤實銷不動、僅本街廠家略有點綴、惟售方心思頗堅、不願輕脫、喊價殊高、昨日某洋行現鈔交易、做開塊煤數百噸、計北海道煤每噸五十八元、統煤五十二元、棧房自出、駁船上下力另加、</p>
<h3>藥材　洋樟腦銷路轉活</h3>
<p>洋樟腦前市銷路平疲、近自外滙突變、成本奇昂、故本市之有存貨者、皆乘機扳售、昨客帮辦去一批、成價爲三百二十元、刻又復高、呌三百五六十元、勢頗活躍、</p>
<h3>苦杏仁港帮動辦</h3>
<p>苦查仁已屆出新時期、惟申市尚無到貨、查此間所存陳貨、亦陸續售出、前市高檔開至六十元、近日港帮需辦頗殷、祇以市間缺乏、僅成交零星一批、其價爲六十二元、比升二元、</p>

<h3>大丈夫莫做愛情中的罪人</h3>
<p>大丈夫應當頂天立地，旣不辜負人，也不辜負自己。站在他時代的崗位上，進可以攻，退可以守，所謂能屈能伸。這種丈夫，那才是社會國家的一個能員，時代女性最理想中的伴侶。因爲他有豐沛的精力，靈敏的頭腦，讀起書來必超人一等，做起事來必勝人一籌，談起愛來，那更熱烈而歡暢，幸福無比，生男育女，聰明而伶俐，更可達到優生的目的。這是多麼的光榮而有意義呀！可是也有一種丈夫，身雖堂堂的男子漢，而爲妻子所吐棄，做着愛情中的罪人，這是什麼緣故呢？據醫學上的論斷，必爲早年犯有自凟遺精，或早婚縱慾，把生殖腺液耗用太多，於是凡早洩陽萎，發育不全，精力渙散，神經衰弱，精薄不育等症，即相繼而來。此種丈夫必然形容枯稿，未老先衰，不特在謀生的職業上或是保護家族的鬥爭上，均必處於慘敗的地位。妻子大都是好勝的，她見了丈夫如此不中用，怎能不中心憎恨呢？至於在夫婦生活上，若丈夫再表現着衰弱無能，或竟完全不能人道，這在她的一顆芳心上更將如何的痛心而疾首！由此而養成閩威者有之，由此而別尋出路，與人私通私奔者有之，由此而振振有詞與夫訴請離婚之訟者，在今日社會上亦是司空見慣！</p>
<p>大丈夫爲何要爲女人所棄而做愛情中的罪人？時在今日醫學昌明，即萬一不幸而患有上述症象，欲求治療亦非難事。治法：據世界名醫及余經騐，均以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最爲對症特效。因此劑係根據生殖腺內分泌補給療法之原理，由雄壯動物如猩猩，海狗，熊鹿等體中提取的生殖腺素用科學方法複製而成，所以品質貴重，效力偉大，爲任何內分泌製所不及。服後於一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，繼續服用半月，更可助長發育，調整新陳代謝，上述各症均可根本治愈。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」以固精關，制止遺洩，則標本兼治，收效允速！</p>
<p>患者陳中白君，年二十六歲，皖人，業大村。客歲轉輾避難來滬，息早洩陽萎甚劇，並有遺精。其妻李氏，甚爲不滿，大有要求離婚之意。余爲之悉心診治，並投於大量「生殖素」及「希米脫氏固精片」使之同服。果於一星期後遺精即止。未及一月亦完全恢復了美滿健康。於是夫婦間愛情濃厚，過去不快陰霾已一掃而空。</p>

<p>假如一個女子，因爲要博得人們讚美，而不惜拚命去買化妝品來裝飾，那眞是最愚蠢而也最糜費的事了。要知在今日的社會里，凡略具醫學常識與時代眼光者，都已知道對於女性的所謂美不美，完全以對方的身體是吾健康以爲斷。換句話說：就是對方是吾有高案的乳峯，丯腴的臀部，以及滋潤而堅實的肌肉。如果此三者不能合乎標準，呈萎癟，瘦削，枯槁狀態者。那麼妳即使把數十元高貴的香水脂粉，完全澆在身上，也不足當時代男性的一盼，倘是遇到儉約快嘴的男子，或許還要冷譏熱諷，認妳只會消費不會生產的女界蠹虫呢？這樣一來，妳如是已出嫁的女性，丈夫見了妳自然只有憎惡，不會歡喜！如是未出門的閨女。那個還敢娶妳這個健美喪失，一無足取的妻子。所以此種女性，其前途命運之悲慘！楚不堪設想的。欲謀袖救，祗有信賴科學。據世界著名婦科專家康脫休及法國美容聖手湯潑生等歷年實騐報吿。均一致公認以服卵巢製劑女用</p>
<p>「生殖素」最爲對症爲特效。蓋乳峯萎癟，臀部瘦削的主要原因：爲生殖腺卵巢機能受自凟束胸，月經不調，白帶不感等症之摧殘，影響新陳代謝作用之故。故此時若以雄狀動物卵巢分泌製成之女用「生殖素」服之，自能於服後一日夜間即可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖宮止帶，倘繼續服用，不惟可使萎癟的乳峯，隆然高聳，且能使臀部丯腴，肌肉滑潤，紅潤面頰，化醜爲嬌艷。</p>
<h3>遺精的生理與病理判別</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>有許多靑年，因爲偶有生理的溢精，而心理上發生着嚴重的恐怖，竟致釀成失眠心悸等狀態者，這太寃枉了！要知遺精有生理與病理之別：凡是一個健康的靑年，生理成熟而未結婚，或婚後與愛妻遠離。因爲生理上所產上的精液過於充沛，在一兩個月之內或有一二决的遺精。遺後並不感覺絲毫倦怠，頭昏等狀態者，此必爲生理的溢精，對於健康毫無妨害，所以不必過慮！若一個素有自　惡癖的靑年，或是早婚縱慾者，摧殘了性神經，使精關弛鬆，於一月之內恒有二三决以上的遺洩，遺後感覺疲倦腦脹等狀態者，此必爲病理的遺精無疑。至於因遺精過久，或先天衰弱病後失調，或憂勞過度等原因，雖於日間亦能有少些精液遺出者，這是最危險的漏精症。</p>
<p>病理的遺精與漏精症，是切不可因循苟且的。能治愈得早，則尚元氣少虧，若遺洩過久，等到精枯血竭，那就百病叢生，最普遍者爲腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，陽萎早洩，發育不全等症即不一而足。此種靑年，在學校將不能繼續其學業，在職業不能勝任愉快，是以前途茫茫！同時在夫婦生活上亦必爲妻不滿，家庭間每因此而演出種種悲劇，是以終生幸福已喪盡了！但在今日醫學昌明時代，治療遺精並非難事。最特效的療法即服「希米脫氏固精片」，則即可鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，遺精可於當夜立止。如已有上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，繼續服用半月，必可根治各症。若患者能親來本診所施用電療注射等法，則更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3>急性白濁爲何易治？</h3>
<p>急性白濁，爲何容易治愈？此問題並不難於答覆。就是淋菌于急性淋時，叢集前尿道，尚未蔓延入內，故治療得法，可一網打盡，不致因竄入後尿道而變症百出，因淋菌一入深部，變症既然百出，則應付淋菌之道，就非常困難，須要化費較長時期之醫治，與比較巨額之金錢。更要經騐豐富，及有負責任心之醫家，才能達到根治之目的。若是治療不得其法，反而愈演愈劇，馴至不可救藥。</p>
<p>凡是狎妓後之三五天至一星期左右，即有淋毒前騐期之出現。即尿道灼夌刺痛，尿意不快，有濁液流出，其後此等症狀增劇，排尿澀痛更甚，膿血交流，此時尿道粘膜，已因炎腫而頻潰爛，故此時用任何器械去洗滌尿道，都容易弄破粘膜的深層，廹毒入內，非特不能速愈，反而造成變症。</p>
<p>最有把握而爲世界醫家所賞用的，無過於採用自家菌苗以爲注射，並用德國濾淋平流電療法，如此則一方增加病家抵抗力，消炎退腫的作用，一方能將透熱作用，直接灼死淋菌。濾淸淋菌，則於三天至五天之內完全可以根治，永不再發。萬試不爽。</p>

<h3>交通簡訊</h3>
<p>— 蘇</p>
<p>（一）目大津事件發生以來，塘沽車站，頓形冷落。由塘沽太古或怡和碼頭與塘沽火車站之間（距離有數里之遙），目下因環境關係，已無洋車代步，且脚夫極少，往來搬運行李等物件，索價昻貴異常。同時在塘沽檢查甚繁，凡欲赴天津或道經塘沽轉往北平之旅客，在可能範圍內，所携行李，務求儘量减少，除可節省旅行開支外，並可免去路途上不少麻煩也。</p>
<p>（二）凡欲赴湘桂者，依據最近交通情形，尚以取道海防再經河內，諒山，龍州，等地轉往爲宜。頃據越南同登來電聲稱，諒山同登間最近山洪暴發，以是諒龍公路，暫時亦在停頓狀態中。查此决山洪來勢頗大，恐非數日內可能退盡，凡赴湘桂旅客請各注意及之。</p>
<p>（三）西南公路晃平段黃菓樹站，係在貴州省之鎭寗縣附近，位於安順與安南之間，有瀑布萬丈，奔來眼底，停車一覽蔚爲奇觀，稱爲黔省名勝之一。中國旅行社有鑒於此，極力籌設黃菓樹食堂，以便旅客抵此進膳時，飽覽奇景。現該食堂業已佈置完竣，且巳於七月一日正式開幕。該地點鄰近瀑布，同時進膳，可容三十二人，客飯分五角二角兩種。查該食堂爲昆明至貴陽之第一日餐站，貴陽至昆明之第三日餐棧，凡各旅行於昆明貴陽間之旅客，得於風塵僕僕中得此機會，欣賞瀑布偉景，實亦極好之機會也。</p>
<h3>內江之交通</h3>
<p>— 葆</p>
<p>內江是成渝鐵路和成渝公路的中心點，地位極爲重要，距離內江五十公里，並有中國最大的鹽塲所在地自流井，（今稱自貢市）所以現在已竟被變作交通要地。內江因爲是成渝鐵路與公路的中點，近來行旅往來頻繁，交通當局，遂在極力設法疏通水陸的交通。</p>
<p>自內江出發的公路，共有兩條：一條是內井公路，就是由內江到自流井去的，長五十公里，爲川康鹽務管理局所興築的，現在歸商人投資設立的垣通汽車公司的汽車行駛。汽車站在內江西門外，路程自內江經過白馬廟，三多寨，到自流井，大的需兩個半小時，再上行可以通富順，威遠，目下雖然還沒有通行汽車，但是可以人力車或者是轎子代步的。</p>
<p>自內江到自流井的票價，普通客車，每位國幣二元四角，小包車六人座，共計國幣十八元。不過現在旅客極多，必須預先登記，才能够貿票。每天分兩班，早班在早晨七點鐘，午班在下午二時。第二條是瀘隆公路，這條路是川滇公路的一段，長一百零二公里，現在也是以內江爲起點。行程自內江經隆昌到瀘州，共需五小時，客車的票價，每位五元六角五分。每天的早晨七點鐘自內江開出。</p>
<p>自內江到了瀘州，乘船上游可以到重慶，的行兩天半，現由小型輪船行駛，計有長缸，華東，民由，景德，等輪。統艙船票，每位四元，房艙每位八元。自瀘州下游可以至叙府，水程一天，票價每位一元。這條航綫就楚渝瀘間的延長錢。由叙府水路，還可以通到嘉定，目下僅有民覺輸一隻專行此綫。往後水位高漲時，船隻就校多了。</p>
<h3>赴美留學用續</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>抵美以後</p>
<p>在船已抵埠，上岸以前，必須經過移民局的查問·頭二等乘客不大麻煩；所謂醫生檢查也多半是官樣文章。問話時，所答的言語，要淸晰簡單，不要自作聰明，滔滔不絕的講述·語氣方面不要過份英國氣，因爲美國人對於他們本國的言語，是非常看重的。同時還要呈騐護照，第六項證書，美國學校准許入學證函或電報·問話通常很簡單，不過問家庭狀况，在美讀書計劃等等·移民局准許入境以後，即可領取行李，經過海關的檢查，便可上岸。行李照例按乘客姓氏的第一字排列，可以自己找出一海關人員到來，便可檢查。海關人員對於學生行李檢查也不大瑣屑，最注意的是珠寳，裝飾品，茶葉，香烟等。凡是自己常用的衣服，書籍等物全無須上稅，但是男人帶女人衣物，或女人帶男人的東西，除非同行的結婚夫婦，一律要納稅·如果有此類送人禮物或旁人托帶的東西，可以托同行的男女友人帶上岸去，免得麻煩·至於生菓，植物等物，則是絕對禁止携帶上岸的。</p>
<p>（一）抵岸參觀　每年秋季大批學生赴美求學，舊金山與西雅圖兩地的我國領事館，華僑與其他中西組織常有歡迎會，團體參觀比較容易，如無大批學生同行，以致於抵美無人接待，而且對於美國情形不適，遊覽參觀當然有些困難，但如果把路途打聽淸楚，也可自己去看，假使在舊金山上岸，可以參觀，博覽會，唐人街，令門公園，（Golden　GatePark）金門橋（Golden　Gate　Bridge），海灣橋（Bay　Bridge）及加洲大學等，更可以乘坐火車到洛杉磯，好萊塢等地一游住宿則可住我國靑年會寄宿舍，如在西雅圖登岸可往唐人街及華盛頓大學等地參觀，住宿則可住馬登旅館（Mars＇Hotol）該旅館專接華人，我國學生往顧，可則便利不少也。</p>
<p>（二）來坐火車（或長途汽車）除少數學生要乘車到西，中，東各部就學，在輪船泊岸以前就有各鐵路公司的代表人上船招攬生意，如果在出國前願向中國旅行社購就車票，則於抵美時得到特別照呼。如擬在口岸停留遊覽，可與之商定時間，托代訂車座（因爲臨時定座不一定有車位可得），如果人多，最好預先的定買同一公司車票同行，則於抵達目的地時無論有無友人接車，大家照拂比較方便得多。自舊金山東行車有聖太飛（Sauta　Fe，）及南太平洋（Sounthern　Pacific）兩鐵路公司，自西雅圖東行者有北太平洋（Northern　Paoific）大北（Great　Northern）及芝加哥密而華記（Ohicago－Milwaukeest.Paul，）等三鐵路公司，各公司均有其特長，無論乘何家公司鐵路沿途都可以享受到各種不同的風景，留美學生乘坐火車大都乘坐椅位（Coach）或遊旅車（Tourist　Class）較爲經濟，此外尚有遊覧車及頭等車等，但價格太高，學生乘坐，似覺過分花費。椅位與遊旅車自舊金山及西雅圖至芝加哥的車資的爲美金四十九元，外加舖位費。</p>

<h3>緬甸外交史（二）</h3>
<p>緬甸國王悉法使携禮物，已抵冷江城，當命備船一艘往迎，駛行七日，方抵京都。法使登岸，王以兩部貔貅，鴛排鷺立，軍戎之盛，實堪耀目。於是法使乘大象入王都，琴裝甫卸，少住行裏。緬甸王之都，四圍若圈豚之狀，城僅一里許，城之內則瑤宮旋室，宮殿巍峨，城之外復有一城，其宏廠較王城兩倍之。城外猶有外廓。宮內妃嬪三百餘人，五步一樓，十步一閣，松雲楝牖，煌煥異常。宮外有御園，麀鹿沼魚，以供娛目。又有議政院一座，蘭若一間。至刑部衙門，白象衙門，鑄銀局，秘密砲局等均有婆娑樾陰，雍穆森嚴之景像也。王城之牆，以柚木製之，城有四鬥，惟東門則非令望華靑之人，不得出入北中。王於東門處預設欽使行臺一所，其內鋪陳，甚爲雅潔，法使到時，王特派員備辦照料，特雇法國廚子為料量中饋。欽使行臺以兵衛之，惟此等兵非徒無益於保護，且恒多偷竊之虞。欽使出入，必有一兵潛尾其後。法使盤旋兩月半，才得見緬甸王。至內殿，法使從其國例，脫履而進，但未戴冠，王乃震怒，將引導官痛駡不已。法使團而席坐，密蓋其足，例不可使王見其足也。王之衣亦甚平常，而鑽石則纍纍如貫珠。法使恭賣饋贈之物後，將國書朗誦一决。議及和的，彼此意見未協，蓋法使有准其立領事，設公司，製造各藝等款，而緬甸王實不願允許也。</p>

<h3>兒童在物價高漲中的責任</h3>
<p>— 蔭</p>
<p>小朋友你旣也是社會中的一份子，那麽，對於社會中所發生的一切問題，當然不能漠不關心。雖然有時不是受着切身的感覺，但任何事物，總有相當關係的。我們就拿目前所發生的各業漲價事件來談吧。薪俸階級的家庭中，所受着的激盪最厲害；父兄平時賺五十元一月的，因爲物價的高漲，只有和以前賺三十元一月一樣。以前每天買半塊錢一天菜蔬的，此刻只能抵得兩角半錢的東西，這樣菜蔬就顯得少，也許你所喜歡吃的魚肉蝦蟹，不能常時有得吃。因爲物價高漲，支出多，收入却並不增加，因此，父母們以前常買玩具給你玩，常買糖菓給你吃，而現在，固定的支出也要緊縮起來，你所愛玩的玩具，你所愛吃的糖菜，自然也不能常時買給你了。暑天中的西瓜，冰棒，汽水，果子露，……這些不是必要的冷飮品，雖然很應時，但爲了節的，也許你至今連一决不曾嘗過滋味；小朋友，你是吾爲了這樣而抱怨你的父母親呢？你是否因爲平日菜蔬不合胃口而表示不滿意呢？</p>
<p>物價這樣的高漲，原因很多；舶來品爲了外匯緊縮而飛漲，許多貨品受着原料價格高漲而跟着增價；有的因某方統制，貨品缺少而居奇；更有使人抱恨的，奸商屯積操縱，趁火打刦。對於物價的平定，我們沒有權力，但是怎樣來應付這個局面，除了我們的家長，小朋友們自己也有相當的責任，第一，我們耍嚴厲的實行節的，用一文錢的時候，必需再三考慮，究竟這一文錢的支出，是吾必要。况且目前因銅元缺乏，所有的東西，都是一分爲最低價格，那麼，十個一分，就是一角，積少成多，影響是很大的。第二，如果認爲某種東西是必需購買的，抱定必用國貨的決心。譬如，買玩具，雖然有某種貨物，價廉，但如果不是國貨，就寗可不買。這個時期，是提倡國貨的最好機會，第三，考查某種貨品漲價的原因，一方面使我們可以了解貨品製造的原料和過程，增加工商業的常識，另一方面可以監察商人，是吾是投機操縱，若確是奸商趁火打刦，那我應盡勸導，警戒他們之責；我們是時代的小主人，應該負起小主人的責任來。</p>
<p>小朋友，我們的知能，需要從實際經騐中獲得的才算寳貴，這正是我們獲得實際經騐的機會呀！</p>
<h3>象是怎樣捉到的？</h3>
<p>— 智慧</p>
<p>小朋友們：你們可曾看過馬戲團的表演嗎？馬戲團裹的許多大象，是從那裏來的呢？他們是從專門捕象的人那裏買來的，那麽專捉象的人又如何把象捉到的呢？下面告訴你一些怎樣捉象的方法：</p>
<p>這些象大多是在長得很大時捉到的，因爲象的生長須經過悠長的歲月，所以，捉得一頭長大了的大象，要比養隻小象來得上算、</p>
<p>野象常出沒於亞洲和非洲等熱帶地區的叢林間，它們常常是成羣而行的。一羣的二三十匹不等，有時多起來要一百多匹。象羣常由一匹知道獲得食物和飮料處所的象爲首領，那爲首的那匹象常是母象。</p>
<p>捕捉野象是一件很難的事，捕象的人常用馴象來帮助他們。他們造起一個巨大堅固的柵欄，用一種一尺粗十餘尺長的木頭造成，外面再包以綠色的樹皮或藤蔓。留出一二個空隙以為入口，這些門戶應該設計一下，以便象羣被驅進柵欄後，能够立刻閉上。</p>
<p>柵欄做好後，捕象人就可等候象的來臨了。當一羣象定近柵欄時，一大羣人，將它們團團園住了，他們手執火把，盡力地搖動呼喊，把象羣驅入柵欄中。等那羣象都走進去了，乃立即關閉柵攔的門。象的氣力很大，假使它們向柵欄撞去的話，柵欄一定要被撞坍。所以當有一隻象撞向柵欄來時，捕象人就用火把等東西來嚇它回去。過了一些時候，這些象已不再想逃走了。這時候，捕象的人們放一批馴象進去，這些馴象是十足的「象奸」，它們會引誘監視那些野象，捕象的人們也悄悄地走進柵欄，用堅固的繩索把那些野象一一捉住。這些野象就被捉住了，加以相當日期的訓練，就可以出賣：並且它們也已變成「象奸」去引誘另外的野象？</p>
<h3>野蠻的風俗</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>——明兒　難記之二十七——</p>
<p>一羣逃難人費了七八天的時光，才踏入了安徽的　山。船中枯悶的生活，明兒也漸漸的過慣了，而他反比平時吃得多，三碗飯是不算一回事的，眞奇怪，他們雖飽嘗到逃難的苦味，然在船上度過了這些日子，反使明兒胖了起來，大概是多吃少用腦力，過那猪樣生活的緣故吧。</p>
<p>陽西墜，天色未黑的當兒，江山船便停靠在岸邊，「這是什麽地方？」「深渡」船老大隨口的答應了一聲。明兒眼見得時間還早，悶坐在船艙裏怪無趣，不如到岸上去走走，况且船在這裏過夜，不怕船老大的催促了。明兒在上岸的時候，咕噥着。。「到底安徽和浙江有些什麽不同？」迢句話被立在船頭上的哥哥聽到了。</p>
<p>「明弟，你瞧，這裏的山岡，都被安徽的農民充分的利用了。一畦一畦的田排在山上，田裏種滿了蠶豆，從這可見安徽的地勢，是多山地的，不然誰高興的到山上去種田呢？這因爲可耕的平地太少了，他們不得不被迫到山上去耕，這樣可以維持生活。而我們所經過的浙江是平地多，因此他們不再去利用山地了，這不是安徽和浙江的不同之點嗎？可見智識是隨地都有，只要細細的去我，而且所找到的活智識，比了書本上有限的死的智識耍有用得多，你以爲對不對？」他哥哥這樣的說着。他母親又呌他一同上岸，照顧他的弟弟。</p>
<p>他們倆一踏上了岸，第一個便使他們感覺到不同的，就是一個個毛坑隨處都有，每個毛坑的式樣可說是千遍一律，很有統一的精神，上面都蓋着似巡警站立的亭子，不過是沒有底的，臭氣充塞在它附近一帶，這是它的勢力範圍，眞是三步一小坑，五步一大坑的排列着。纏脚的風俗這裏也很盛行，明兒看得快要笑出來。你想：不過十歲左右的女孩子的頭上已梳了一個重得垂下的髮髻，竟佔了全頭三分之一的地位，在女孩子小頭後面拖着這麽大的髮鬢，算是美的嗎？伊們更纏着叉小又玲瓏（？）的脚，走起路來，輕移蓮步，多麽嬝娜呀？大的髮髻小的脚，這時當地人以爲美觀的。伊們每個人兩隻手都拿着竹籃，藏在布裙裹，在街上踱出踱進。（因爲那時已是深秋，那裏的氣候已很寒冷了。那竹籃裏面放了炭，來取暖，那裏的人呌它「烘籃」。）這種怪態，怪不得引得明兒也笑了。可是在他哥哥的眼中有些異樣的感覺，他便輕輕地對他弟弟說道：「你還好笑，我簡直可以哭得出。正是身體在發育的時期，而他們却把伊們活生生的硬變成這個怪模樣，使伊們具有年老人的老態，畸形的發育爲成人，生出來的孩子如何會强健呢？所以我以爲不如把伊們放了倒暢快，不要害了後代。這種野蠻的風俗還存在在現代，怪不得中國有「東亞病夫」的雅號了。」明兒的哥哥說了這一大番話，明兒覺得很以爲然。他們倆便不願再瞧下去，便忽忽的回到船上來。</p>
<p>這晚，江山船附近的急流聲，潺潺地響着，似乎是替那一羣可憐的女孩子們在訴怨，不過這有什麼用呢？「我將來一定要改革這野蠻的風俗！」明兒在漆黑的艙中喃喃的唸着。</p>

<p>構造法：蠟紙，將火酒燈（火酒燈可用膠水瓶做）放在香烟罐內，上面再罩一隻，在旁需開一洞，放少許蠟燭油在上面，香烟罐的底上，將大楷紙在蠟燭油內略浸一下，蠟即很平均的舖在紙上。然後再另換一處，使燭油完全塗到爲止。等冷却後，剪成長六寸，闊三寸半。（見一圖）</p>
<p>鋼板：將香烟罐剪成一張平的鉛皮。大小隨便。用舊洋刀劃成如（二圖）的交叉式。</p>
<p>油墨棍：切一段三寸長的洋蠟燭，將中間的燈芯取去，用鉛絲穿在孔中。再鉗成（三圖）的式樣。</p>
<p>油墨：將墨膺濃之後，加入少許漿糊，再磨即成。不可太厚。</p>
<p>構造法</p>
<p>將蠟紙在鋼板上用鋼筆寫你所需要的字。上面覆一張白報紙，與蠟紙同樣尺寸。用圖畫釘將二紙撳牢在五夾板或厚紙上，蠟紙下面放幾張較小的白報紙。（見四圖）工作部完了，只需上油待印。</p>
<p>用法：蠟紙上面的報紙，裏面用稍厚的油墨塗上少許，塗好之後。將紙放下，在上面再用薄的油墨塗上，將油墨棍向前一推。（需重）最後將上面的報紙及蠟紙一同取起：下面的白報紙上即印着很淸爽的黑字。然後放下，印第二張。只需在報紙上面再一推。印了數張之後，再加些油墨，一張　紙可印數十張之多。</p>
<p>原因：黑中爲何要加漿糊？因爲墨水容易化，所以加人漿糊後則成黏性，那就不會化了。</p>
<p>這種小工藝用處雖然不廣，却頗感與趣。我希望各位小朋友，照上面的方法去做，在試做時要作史進一步的硏究。</p>
<h3>畜生道中（十）（一）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>於是那些畜類一齊圍了攏來，成了個大圈圈兒，將彭其圍在當中，叉公推了住在近邊水溝裏的一頭老公蛙，擔任了守望之職。這老公蛙本來有兩隻挺大的眼睛，呌它守望是再配也沒有的，它的態度十分冷靜，而又謹愼得很。在彭其受審的期間，這老公蛙不住的嚷着：「閣閣閣！」「閣閣閣！」似乎警備的模樑。</p>
<p>那時，那獅子好像裁判官般開口問道：「你們控告罪人，爲的是什麼一回事？」</p>
<p>大家一聽了這話，連忙向四面觀看，想推出山雀來說明一切，誰知它也像人類中那些只會搬弄是非而不肯負責的人類一樣，趁着亂烘烘秩序未定的時光，早就飛開去了。於是別的畜類只得苦苦地想着，想把它們先前所聽得的關於彭其的罪狀，一一訴說出來。</p>
<p>「他虐待狗子，更把它們拋在水中生生的溺死，他捉到了猫兒，也活活的弄死—」彭其見它們很切實的舉出他的罪狀來，心中暗暗吃驚，連忙揷嘴道：「殺死猫兒的是勒夫那老公蛙聽了彭其的話，似乎不以爲然，忽又喊了一聲「閣」不許彭其再說下去。</p>
<p>獅子抱着裁判官那種嚴正的態度，開口發令道：「傳勒夫上來」！當下就有專員奉令出發，傳勒夫去了。</p>
<p>正在這時，忽有一頭美麗的公鷄，大踏步走將上來，放聲呌道：「喔，喔，喔！撲，找，撲！（道是拍動翅膀的聲音）你們旣要去傳集要證，還須多傳一個來。喔，喔，喔！我在發言的當兒，別的公鷄可不許開口。你們可知道有一個喜鬥鷄而爲非作惡的年靑無賴子麼？我就知道這麼一個人，他的名士呌做小湯。我們就把他帶到這裹來，和他的好友彭其合在一起，我們就把鉅鐵縛在他們的脚跟上，喚他們彼此踢來踢去，更把他們的眼珠子各自抓將出來。這是一種很難得的好玩意，凡是玩意，總是很有興趣的，我們得從旁鼓勵他們。喔，喔，喔！」說時，又撲撲撲的拍着兩個翅膀。</p>
<p>那公鷄點起了脚尖，正想再作長鳴的時候，猛聽得一陣脚步聲和一陣頸圈鍊子的鏗鏘之聲，原來那鬃毛狗勒夫已很莽撞的走到了它的圈兒裏來，聳着一雙短耳朶，和一條硬尾巴。</p>
<p>獅子一見它走上來，就開口說道：「勒夫先生，據這犯人說，虐待貉兒們的是你，並不是</p>
<p>勒夫發野似的跳來跳去，一面狂呌着道：「汪，汪，汪！這是誰的罪過？汪，汪，汪！這是誰敎我做的？汪，汪！就是彭其那壞孩子、汪，汪！我恨不得抓住了他的背脊骨，把她甩一下子，好像摔一頭瘋子一樣。汪，汪，汪！」</p>
<p>大家聽了這些話，非常興奮，一時都鼓噪起來：只聽得月眾人怒呼道：「守規矩！守規矩！」於是四下裏頓是寂靜了。</p>
<p>勒夫在獅子盤詰之下，堅持它對於貓兒們的行爲，全是由於彭其一流人所敎導所唆使的。有時在發野的時光，對於貓兒們就沒有好感，難免有追趕和傷害的事情發生：其實它對於自己家裏的貓兒，一向是要好。它們同在一個廚房裏，非常和睦，連吃飯也在一個碟子裏同吃，從不爭吵。當下它又承認它的天性是喜歡撕碎東西的，而允其喜歡撕碎一切有毛的東四。但他也並不一定要侮弄有毛的生物，只須一隻毛邊的睡鞋，或其他長着毛的物件，它也可以過癮了。</p>

<h3>國貨販賣員</h3>
<p>— 雁</p>
<p>爲了失業，也爲了生活的煎迫，而謀不到其他適當的行業，我就由一個朋友的介紹，憑着「四十元爲限」的舖保，加入在××國貨服務社爲販賣員；那兒，是一羣失業靑年的薈集場所，是過渡求業者的良機。但，事實是無庸否認的，我們這一羣失業靑年，是在飢餓線上掙扎着，是在備嘗着人間的艱辛和痛苦！</p>
<p>每天，我們在早晨七點鍾的時候，便到社裏去提取貨物，繼而大家携着籐匣，或手提篋，互相分道，向着各人的「新路」漫無目的地走去。在住戶中的里弄裏，或與我們沒有營業衝突的商舖裏，以及可能允許我們兜售的公共場所，我們便打開匣蓋，用言語去打動主顧的心。但我們有劃一的價格，不討大主顧的買價，而也絕不允許還價；這定價較之「眞不二價」的商店裏的，每件貨物大概稍爲便宜二分至五分左右。由於這救濟失業的國貨服務社的發源，已歷二年多的歷史，所以每一個主顧已能深知我們推銷的宗旨，和有着良好的印象，因此，他們不購買我們的貨物則罷，要是購買的話，決不會和對待一般的商販一樣，——時常發生還價爭持的困難的。</p>
<p>我們所推銷的貨物，是日用必需品，但限於國貨，內分化妝品，零件五金，零件藥品，學校用具，賽璐珞品等四十餘種。因爲我開始入社服務是在暮春的時候，所以我推銷的貨物，除牙刷，牙膏，髪梳，烟咀，鉛筆之類以外，大都便是夏令應用的什物：花露水，痱子粉，八卦丹，人丹，……總之，我們的營業，同樣是要適應時令的。</p>
<p>我們商品的盈利率，相差大概爲二分利，我們與社方的拆賑，是以獲利的二八計算，即社方二成，社員八成。社員每月的營業額，規定至少須六十元，不達此額即取銷資格；但，如果第一社員的營業額，每月只能夠到六十元，則此區區的盈利十分之八，那裏够一月的飯錢呢？而其他的生活費用，更不用說了！不過，光是這六十元的營業額，已是很不容易，而在一個新社員要掙到此數，更是困難！</p>
<p>我幹這種生涯已有三閱月了，在這三閱月中，整天到晚——不論是晴天或雨天，我終是和其他的社員們一樣，跑得腿和腰奇酸，奇疼。可是第一個月的推銷額，費了九牛二虎之力的結果，是只有六十元，第二和第三個月增到七十元，然也只够飯錢的支出。我知道，我是無日不在飢餓的長途奔波，而受盡痛苦的煎熬，至於其他三四十個服務久長的同伴，他們的營業額，最多也不會超過百元，在這樣物價飛漲的現象下，如此拆賑收入，更是絕難維持生活。不過，我們的精神却是愉快的，因爲不論怎樣，我們終究是在自食其力，我們終究較推銷劣貨的「掮客」們，在良心上要自慰得多，我們深信，只要奮鬥到底，我們一定有光明的出路。</p>

<h3>陋巷一朶花</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“One　Third　of　a　Nation”</p>
<p>「陋巷一朶花」的題材對於孤島上的我們多少有些聯繫的關係的。紐約陋巷裡，房屋都已破舊不堪，然而地主並不注意，當發生火災的時候，一個呌做佐意的孩子從太平梯上跌下來，折斷了腿。佐意的姊姊曼麗，痛詆地主彼得後，彼得願意拆除舊屋，建築新居，這部電影的結束，就是大興土木，建立了新的住宅。</p>
<p>在上海，果然也時常聽到因爲房屋的破舊而發生的悲劇；然而當前的問題却並不在此，即使地主願意拆除舊屋，房客們却鮮有肯遷居的，難道他們願意以自己的生命和破房子打賭嗎？自然不是的！問題是在新房屋建造後的租價，是否這些老房客所能担任得起的。「陋巷一朶花」的劇作者能把兩個絕對不同階級的人們携手起來，這用意是值得稱許的，但是他忽略了最後的條件，我們在同情之外，還需要互助，尤其是在此時此地。</p>
<p>關於演出，在導演者的卓越手腕之下，整個戲非常生動，緊湊，更其是剪接的明快。舉幾個例來說：（一）佐意跌傷後，坐了彼得的汽車赴醫院，他用三個遠景，把陋巷和富麗的住宅作強烈的對比；曼麗　見彼得的時候，他也同樣用遠景的陪儭來顯示這兩個不同階級的人們的懸殊。（二）佐意折腿後回到陋巷，同伴們的踢球，洗澡，都使佐意因爲失却了行動的自由，而仇視這所舊房子。其他，如曼麗等方高興彼得的願意拆除舊屋，重建新居的時候，彼得之妹却在計算着成本的不　算，而和彼得大　。及彼得到陋巷來時的東踢西倒，曼麗到彼得家時却能和僕人東奔西逃等等。整個戲雖沒有大場面及明顯的高潮，但這對照手法的運用得當，就是演出上成功的地方。</p>
<p>薛爾維雪的曼麗和依列加蓀的彼得都努力。更值得提出的是演佐意的那個孩子，有驚人的成就。</p>
<p>看膩了都市少爺和小姐們的戀愛電影的讀者，我向你們介紹這張「陋巷一朶花」。</p>
<h3>啟事</h3>

<h3>女彈詞人物誌</h3>
<p>— 沈宥</p>
<p>現特節錄如後：</p>
<p>孔芝葉姓，乳名庚庚，吳中彈詞女也。年十七八，絕代容華，性甚孤潔，必多方羅致，始姍姍而來。意有所忤，輒終日無一語。……茂苑顏生深村，……識孔芝於席間，舉止端莊，絕無媚態。生隱念院中人大都流蕩，不意有穩重若此者，頗爲憐惜。……狎暱旣久，訂以婚嫁，雖不及於亂，卻有甚於畫眉者。生家居臨河，一日憑闌凝眺，忽見岩傍停畫舫，中有女郎，若隱若現，略一瞻顧，韶秀絕倫，較孔芝尤妙好也。注目良久，女乃啟窗來窺。詰之，自言小學戍卿，榜人女，父赴淮上未歸。……又謂奉侍箕蒂，妾所願也。……生頷之，遂於孔芝處稍疏。孔亦疑其有他，瞥見臂上琅琅，知爲閨中物，問所自來，生不能隱。……迨戍卿之父歸，陷以重金，事乃成。涓吉有期，日夕徬徨，營謀金物，亦無暇視孔芝，孔芝恨甚，僞爲游虎丘，僱坐戍舟，入船平視，見戍卿玉立亭亭，眉目若畫，自顧以爲不如。偶與傾談，兩情自治。……彼此解顧，化妒爲愛，戍且欲孔共事顏生。……屆期，生洒掃庭除，大會親友，日將午、咸曰，靑廬來矣，出而視之，孔芝也。生曰：「當時香火誓，君豈忘心……」繼又异一　至，細碎蓮步而出，乃戍卿也。……斯時生則痴然以立，婦則卓然以驚，兩女則啞然以笑，而滿座賓朋，咸相顧失色，不知其所以。蓋孔芝已棄業，匿戍舟中，是日生家以肩輿迎，先令孔乘輿去，戍乃後至焉，生婦素賢，兩女又曲意承順，兼能了當庶務，暇則孔芝撥琵琶丁丁然，戍卿唱櫂歌一關，深以爲樂……</p>
<p>女彈詞人物中之形形色色，至此叙述略備。然大都爲光緒十年（一八八四）前之活躍者，逾此，則皮簧起，而彈詞遂不爲聽衆所喜。故靑溪月圓人壽樓主「申江竹枝詞」中，有「爲郞愛聽京腔調，不弄琵琶換月琴」（申報）之句。即嗣後刋行之「上海遊戲圖說」（一八九九），「海上百花傳」（一九〇三）「冶遊上海雜記」（一九〇八）諸書，亦不似光緒三年（一八七七）前所刋之「上海冶遊備覽」，「海上煙花瑣記」之必有「女彈詞」叙述矣。</p>
<p>「女彈詞」共分六章，約八萬字，和「雨過天靑」間日刋登，適每月刋一章，六日刋完。現因下月起，「春秋」將縮小篇幅，兩個長篇勢不能兼顧，故在「女彈詞」結束時，亦暫時停刋，待將來恢復原狀，再行陸續刋登，特此向作者，讀者致歉。　編者</p>
<h3>低薪職工的呼籲</h3>
<p>— 仁安</p>
<p>最近，外匯暴縮，百物飛漲，米價亦因投機者的操縱，竟高漲至二十元以外，雖經工部局嚴厲執行限價，然而上漲之風，仍未稍戢。據工部局的統計，六月份的生活費指數，已高至一七六·一五；工人的工資，祇能抵到二十五年度的五六·七七。生活在孤島上的人們，無不呌苦連天，尤其是一般以薪水度活者。因此，公司，工廠，銀行，商店大多擬有津貼職工的辦法。</p>
<p>我是一個全國最大文化機關裏的小職工，我們非但沒有分文津貼，並且現在還照三十二元的原薪打了一個九折，因爲實得薪水還不到三十元，（三十元以下已於今年四月恢復原薪）所以補足三十元發給。一家三口，每月除了十元房金，五斗白米和一担煤球外，所剩者僅六七元而已。無疑的，每天早晚靠兩只脚來跑外，中午果腹的不是油條大餅，便是陽春麪加一，偶而吃上頓湯麵，已是破例的了。但是像這種最低限度的生活，結果，還是不能維持呀</p>
<p>渴望著已久的恢復原薪和津貼低薪職工的通告，終於前天張貼了。辦法是從八月份起，大小薪水，一律恢復原薪。同時，獎勵金的辦法亦隨之而取消。除了薪水在二十元以下（原打八折），及三十元以下（原打七折），先後已恢復原薪允予個別考慮酌加外，且將現在折扣的情形，寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）原薪三十元以上至五十元者九折（原打七折）</p>
<p>（二）原薪五十元以上至一百元者八折（原打六折）</p>
<p>（三）原薪一百元以上至四百元者七折（原打對折）</p>
<p>（四）原薪四百以上至一千元者六折（原打四折）</p>
<p>綜觀以上恢復原薪的辦法，薪水大者，可以恢復四成；薪水小者，祇得恢復一成；換句話說，薪水大者，最高可恢復四百元，小者最高亦不過五元而已。而且，事實上在五十元以下的低薪職工，非但沒有得到恢復的一成，反而有被剝削了去的。以我三十二元的薪水而論，恢復了原薪以後，在表面上看來，每月是多得了二元錢，一年就多得了二十四元。可是獎勵金辦法的取消，會使你每半年損失半個月薪水左右的獎金，一年可就損失三十二元。這種辦法，對於低薪職工的處置，顯然是不得當的。現在，我們至誠地希望公司當局，能够有補救低薪職工的辦法。如每月每人發給三五元的津貼，或者仿照某大書局的津貼職工辦法，以米價作爲津貼的標準，（見二十六日本刋）總之，要能够维持低薪职工最低限度的生活才好。</p>

<p>藝人漫記</p>
<h3>舞台與銀幕（上）</h3>
<p>— 夏霞</p>
<p>－是我的娘家與婆家</p>
<p>編者介紹：夏霞，是一位　好劇藝之北平姑娘，三年前初來海上，於「賽金花」舞台劇中演顧媽一角，一鳴驚人，負名於時。嗣轉電影界，亦多優良成就。在文學方面，尤極當修養，能自編劇本，兼任導演。最近，銀聯劇社公演「緩期還債」一劇，即其初試導演之處女作；新華當局重其才，聞亦有將升為導演之說。前途造就，未可限量，洵一多才多藝，異於恒流之優特女藝人也。</p>
<p>舞台是我的娘家，銀幕是我的婆家。記得那本刊物上這樣說過我，並且，後面還附有些鼓勵的話，說什麼『嫁出的女潑出去的水，雖然是到了婆家，可是別辜負了娘家的一番教養才好。』這個比喻倒相當的恰當。我是由舞台出身跳上銀幕，正好像由娘家嫁到婆家。但是，我卻不是嫁出去的女潑出去的水，因為直到現在，我始終還沒有完全忘不了開娘家，整個心與身雖都到了婆家；實在我還是站在娘家與婆家之間的。我愛娘家，我也愛婆家；丟開娘家到婆家去我不願意，老留在娘家不到婆家去我也捨不得。總括一句話：舞台與銀幕在我心中站著同樣的地位，我同樣的愛好貪戀，並且我願意在雙方都做一個忠實而有出息的好女兒。這裏，此我願將我與娘家和婆家過去的關係，現在的情形，與將來的希望，分作三段來講：那是三年以前的事情了！我得到了家庭的允許，脫離學校，到上海來從事我渴望了多年的影戲生活。這時候，懷著一個美麗的夢，帶這一腔熱烈的希望，我跳上了平滬通車，雖然在路上要走三四十個小時，但是我沒有閉上過一小時的眼睛，睡過一小時的覺；當時那種興奮緊張的情緒，自己也沒法安靜下去。現在回想起來，真是够好笑也够可憐的！</p>
<p>到了上海，因為人地生疏，沒有一個親戚，沒有一個朋友，只有一個在北邊教過我書的先生幫我的忙。但是他和電影界也並沒有什麼够深節的關係，他所能做的，也只是為我吹噓介紹而已。上海是那麼大，人才是那麼多，像我這樣一個無足驚人還帶點北邊憨氣的女孩子，當然不曾引起人家的注意；所以，忙了好幾天，一點頭緒也沒有。</p>
<p>彷徨焦急的過了十多天，飯也吃不好，覺也　不安，腦子幾乎都想空了，也想不出個辦法來，每天只是　這影戲圈的大門　息。但是，「有志者事竟成一這話一點不錯的。雖然那時我深深的感到投奔無門告幫無　的一籌莫展，我卻並沒有就此灰心氣餒，放棄了希望。當白日奔忙了，一天沒有什麼結果時，在晚上夜深人靜，萬　　寂躺在床上，自己就安慰自己說：「等著吧！今天雖然沒希望的過去了，還有明天呢？明天也許會帶了希望來，也　可知。」</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>大軸戲前休息十分鐘的意義</p>
<p>那種故意使你生氣的神情，實在是廈門大學再大的人也決難包容下的。往往戲館子裏打吵子（即吵嘴打架）多半就是從這上頭而起，還有一層，晚近的戲與以前不同，從前每天至少有三四　戲可聽，現在花了很多的錢，紙聽最後的一　戲，（即大軸）誰知幾個鐘點的罪都受過啦。等你剛要專心一意聽臺上的大軸時，突然來了一羣人，收票的收票，要茶錢的要茶錢，他如手中把錢，送衣帽的錢，繼續不斷的纏擾不清，給的少啦，當然要爭，即令為免除麻煩起見，恐　　聽戲，多給人幾文，那末，他們又拿你當闊大爺，打　作揖的還要請您老高升，這個樣子的戲，敢問如何能聽得下去？況且每年春季，許多外國遊歷團團員都紛紛　平遊覽，其中有很多愛好中劇的人也時常涉足污　狹隘的中劇場裏，不但同樣受到上述種種的的煩擾，並且還看到樓上樓下滿園手巾把子飛舞的怪狀，因此就有些嘴皮缺德的外賓齊說道，中國戲不但舞臺上的伶人能演，就連滿園裏茶役們也都能打出手呢。</p>
<p>我鑒於上述種種不堪的壞現狀後，遂決意先令各園於大軸戲前一律休息十分鐘，臺上停止　鼓，同時臺下的人儘可在此時小便，閑談，賣香烟，水果，等的小販，趁此際兜售，收票及取茶資的也在道時趕辦清楚，各園大小不同，上座多寡無定，名雖休息十分鐘，實則收齊了算完。各茶役既為時間所限，遂亦不敢多事需索，及至前臺諸事辦完，於是大軸戲乃繼續上場，演員眾精會神，賣力唱作，聽眾專心一意，面對臺上，秩序既桂，全場自然寂靜無　，演戲者不白賣氣力，顧客們票價亦不虛耗，這就是當時建議在大軸前休息十分釧的意義。（七〇）</p>
<h3>寫好劇本</h3>
<p>— 鋒</p>
<p>好萊塢某導影先進會說過，好的電影劇本，必須具下列諸要素：（一）劇情要緊張，（二）對白宜滑稽，（三）意思要涵蓄，（四）要肉感，但同時不可粗俗或過於顯露，（五）要有貴族生活之描寫；根據以上所說的，我們就編了一　劇本，這劇本，不惟能滿足右列諸條件，並且非常短小精幹。不信請看下面就是：「公爵夫人打哈哈地說：「陛下，你別這樣拉我的大腿，」」（摘錄「論語」兩花欄）</p>
<h3>野草閒花</h3>

<p>昨日上午十時許陳暈裳偕陳燕燕，黎明輝，華姐尼及陳母姍姍而來，陳衣粉白淡紅西裝，鬢絲　　緞帶，　　作蝴蝶舞。姿容　麗，笑容可掬，令人興「雲想衣裳花想容」之感</p>
<p>有幾位明星的照片都曾做過電影畫報的封面，像「路明撐傘　立」的一張，從前曾做過「電聲」的封面，「談瑛　於花草　中」的一張，也曾做過「青青電影」的封面。</p>
<p>五彩照片定價百元，買者較少，而烟台張裕　酒公司特定ｚｈｏ　　ｒ一幀，據說該公司副經理朱梅，因愛伊天真活潑，歌喉嘹亮，不久將攝「葡萄仙子」宣傅片一本，或將邀周主演云。</p>
<p>此次主展，男明星只有張翼，施超，高占非，尚冠武等數幀。老商除個人照外，並有同小高合攝一影，在此盛傅老高興白羊熱戀聲中，小高諸此，也將不　感慨！尚冠武的英姿，真不愧為大　賈之典型，如今電影界幾無人能　承此項角色，誠堪惋惜。</p>

<h3>溜冰術（三○）</h3>
<p>— 蓮君琦珍合編</p>
<p>四邊　結論</p>
<p>學習四邊時，務須留意以下四點：（甲）用鞋之外邊行動時，客足之移動，始終在所畫圈線之外。</p>
<p>下圖實線示主足，處線示客足之路由。</p>
<p>（乙）用鞋之裏邊行動時，客腿須橫過主腿到所畫圈線之外，但在移至前面而經過主腿時，（圖中Ａ字）又須暫到所畫圈線之內，待經過後再回至圈線之外，圖中處線示客足路山。</p>
<p>（丙）四邊練熱後，又須注意所書所畫弧線之形式與地位，第一弧之終，與第二弧之始，須延長成一直線，即同一行動方向，則圈必不失形。</p>
<p>（一）下圖內之簡，指示自a點行至b點，每次開步應取方向。</p>
<p>（二）下圖內簡指示，開步時所取方向錯誤，致圈之地位移動。</p>
<p>此點於交腳行動時最易見之，普通交腳進前退後，不易學會之故，因初學者不明此道，與不知行動軌道是一弧形。</p>
<p>（丁）弧行時全身並不面向前，身宜側，肩與臀　步時先與主足　平，後隨第一步之弧線漸漸移至第二步開始時之位置。</p>
<p>以上四邊基　既定，則往後學任何花樣，必可迎刃而解矣。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in Xia County, Shanxi Province, Repulsed in Eastern Offensive; Japanese Troops Advancing Along Datong-Puzhou and Pinghan Railways Also Blocked; Chinese Troops in Hubei Province Surround and Attack Southeast Gate of Qianjiang, Heavy Fighting Ensues; Yi'an County Reportedly Recaptured the Next Day, Japanese Troops in the City Completely Annihilated</h3>
<p>(Luoyang) On the 27th, over a thousand Japanese troops from Xia County launched a three-pronged attack and engaged in fierce battles for a day and night at Chuanjia Xie, Wende Village, and Nanbeishan Di (all located east of Xia County). Both sides suffered heavy casualties. On the 28th at noon, during heavy rain, a portion of about 300 Japanese troops broke through the defense line at Huawen De Village and entered Lijia Village (east of Wende Village). Another contingent of 400 to 500 troops crossed Nanbeishan Di and attacked and occupied Wu Jia Yu (east of Nanbeishan Di). Subsequently, Chinese troops reinforced the area in large numbers and launched a fierce counterattack against the Japanese, with a portion flanking the Japanese rear. The Japanese troops, attacked on two sides by the Chinese, were unable to withstand the assault and retreated to their original positions, resisting stubbornly. The Chinese army is continuing its attack. In this battle, the Chinese army suffered 60 to 70 casualties, while the Japanese army's casualties were double that number. (Dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) On the 27th at noon, over 3,000 Japanese troops with eight artillery pieces were reinforced from Yuncheng towards Xia County. Subsequently, another 800 to 900 Japanese troops with six artillery pieces were reinforced from Anyi towards Huashangxia Yan Di, Xia County, launching an attack. The infantry was divided into three groups for an eastern offensive. One group of 400 with six artillery pieces went south from Di; another group of over 300 harassed Beishan Di (east of Xia County); and another group of over 300 with several artillery pieces threatened Wende Village Fujia Yin (east of Xia County). The Chinese army has divided its forces to intercept them. (Dispatch from the 28th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>China's Environment and the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>In the past week, the situation in a corner of the Far East has been unusually tense, with the eyes of the world fixed on the area in amazement and surprise. The Chinese people, being directly involved in the situation, have inevitably experienced extreme psychological changes. Initially, the sharp depreciation of foreign exchange rates caused unusual anxiety and frustration. Then, the content of the preliminary Anglo-Japanese agreement was revealed, triggering widespread condemnation throughout China. However, when the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty was terminated, and news broke of the imminent termination of Anglo-Japanese commercial treaties, along with reports of a Soviet credit loan to China, the Chinese people suddenly became elated. Psychological anxiety, indignation, and excitement are all natural reactions, and there is no need to deliberately suppress them. However, given the current volatile situation and the prospect of even more significant developments, it is crucial for the Chinese people to exercise reason and pay close attention to the future of the situation while also experiencing elation.</p>
<p>The recent major events are all related to the Sino-Japanese War, but they also involve international relations. This can easily lead to the misconception that the key to the China problem lies entirely in international relations. This misconception suggests that the fate of China's War of Resistance is not in its own hands. In reality, while the China problem is closely related to global issues, China's destiny is not determined by others but is still in its own hands. In his recent weekly address, President Chiang Kai-shek made several famous statements: "This War of Resistance is a struggle to complete the revolution, and the revolution is absolutely unaffected by changes in the external environment." The Chinese people should deeply appreciate these words and understand that no matter how the environment changes, China's future remains in its own control.</p>
<p>President Chiang Kai-shek made these remarks when the Anglo-Japanese preliminary agreement was established, but they were not intended as a way to downplay Chinese disappointment. A leader of a nation and a people, especially a wise leader like President Chiang Kai-shek, does not need to offer mere excuses to his people. Rather, these statements are based on the painful experience accumulated over the past two years, which has led the Chinese people to believe that the success of the War of Resistance depends on being unaffected by the external environment. China does not need isolation, nor does it not need a favorable environment. So, what exactly is the relationship between China's War of Resistance and the environment? Negatively speaking, if the environment is not conducive, China does not need to change its stance. Positively speaking, all favorable environments cannot be created out of thin air, and China needs to resolutely strive for them with its determination and strength in the War of Resistance. When the war first started, there were sympathetic voices for China in the international community, but they were not enthusiastic or widespread enough. This was partly because even some genuine allies had their own internal conflicts, which prevented them from taking a positive stance on the Far East issue. However, the greater reason was that the world did not fully recognize China's determination and strength in the War of Resistance. The international community mistakenly believed that Japan's aggression would be limited or would respect the interests of third countries in China. At the same time, they mistakenly believed that China's War of Resistance might not be sustainable. Therefore, they hesitated, mostly adopting a wait-and-see attitude and refraining from taking concrete action beyond expressing moral support. However, China implemented the War of Resistance regardless of everything and, in the process, built and strengthened itself, transforming itself from a chain of iron into steel. Simultaneously, in this process, it won the sympathy and support of various countries, gradually moving from moral resonance to practical support. This is an example of how China's War of Resistance does not depend on the environment but strives for it. It also proves the ancient wisdom of "Heaven helps those who help themselves" and "Those who are virtuous receive abundant assistance." If China had been preoccupied with gains and losses concerning the external environment from the beginning, it would not have made its current progress. Similarly, to strive for final victory, China today must not adopt a gain-or-loss attitude towards the environment and rely entirely on it.</p>
<p>Considering the current facts, what we consider as reasons for anxiety and indignation may not be without the potential to break the stalemate! For example, after a period of chaos, the foreign exchange market has gradually calmed down. Furthermore, while Britain has willingly recognized Japan's principles, the examination of concrete issues remains uncertain. Chamberlain is trying to reconcile the wording of the Anglo-Japanese agreement, believing himself to be complacent, but who knows if he will make a change of course? Conversely, things that are considered worth celebrating may not be without complications. Now that the United States has announced the termination of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, what will the next step be? If the Japanese side tries to ingratiate itself, how will the United States respond? Moreover, the world situation is constantly changing, and can we be certain that facts will not evolve to affect the Far East in any way? If the situation does not progress in a linear fashion, how will China handle itself? Therefore, the only answer is that China should adhere to its own stance, recognize its own path, and use unwavering determination to achieve its goal of resisting aggression and building the nation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, just as China used its determination and strength in the War of Resistance to gain international assistance, China in the future should use even greater determination and strength to gain even wider support from the world. In fact, China, which has grown during the two years of war resistance, is far superior to what it was two years ago in terms of military, economic, and political aspects. There is no reason why it cannot gain even greater assistance. "Those who are virtuous receive abundant assistance." As long as China does not change its path, it will certainly receive abundant assistance. Therefore, even if China is now considered to be gradually entering a favorable environment, how to maintain this favorable environment still depends on making good use of the current foundation, maintaining greater determination, and cultivating greater strength.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Japanese Differences Lead to Stalemate in Negotiations; Japanese Military Insists on Implementing Economic Demands; British Government Urges Removal of Tianjin Blockade</h3>
<p>(London) According to a diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Mail, British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie is seeking instructions from London regarding the differences of opinion in the Tokyo talks regarding the prohibition of Chinese legal tender and the transfer of silver reserves in the British concession in Tianjin. The British side believes that legal tender is the recognized currency of the Chinese government and that Britain cannot prohibit its use, while the Japanese side claims that the circulation of legal tender hinders the establishment of the banknotes it wants to use. (Reuters dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>(London) According to today's inquiries, British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, apparently encouraged by the United States' termination of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, has instructed the British Ambassador in Tokyo to urge the Japanese side to remove the blockade of Tianjin as soon as possible. If the Japanese side continues to blockade Tianjin, it will affect subsequent negotiations in Tokyo. (Associated Press dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>(London) According to sources here, the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo have reached a stalemate. British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie is currently seeking new instructions from London regarding the Tianjin concession currency issue. (Huitong News dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a Japanese newspaper, the Anglo-Japanese roundtable conference is on the verge of collapse because the representatives of both sides still have widely divergent opinions on the issues of legal tender and silver reserves. Last night, officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Army gathered to discuss this matter and were reported to have decided to maintain the Japanese viewpoint. According to the Nichinichi Shimbun, the Japanese army holds the view that if the British side continues to maintain its dishonest attitude, the conference will inevitably collapse completely. It is reported that the British representative believes that the abandonment or preservation of silver owned by the Chinese National Bank is purely a matter for the Chinese banks to decide, and that the storage of silver in the British concession is accidental and an economic matter, so the Craigie-Arita agreement cannot be applied. However, the Japanese side insists that the resolution of economic issues is necessary to maintain peace and order in Tianjin. Therefore, the British side, based on the Craigie-Arita agreement, must accept the Japanese demands. (Reuters dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Anglo-Japanese Tokyo Conference held negotiations on the Tianjin security issue, proceeded smoothly, and achieved satisfactory results. However, when discussing economic issues such as the prohibition of legal tender circulation and the transfer of silver, the opinions of the two sides suddenly diverged, making the future completely unpredictable. According to the British claim, economic issues are related to the national policy of the country and are completely different in nature from the issue of security. Therefore, the general principle of understanding reached between Arita and Craigie should not include economic issues. However, the Japanese military authorities are extremely concerned about economic issues and believe that this issue is the central and important part of the current meeting. The prohibition of legal tender circulation and the transfer of silver reserves are fundamental factors in the Chinese security issue. Therefore, the security issue cannot be resolved without resolving the economic issue. The Japanese side must resolve these two issues together and absolutely opposes resolving them separately. The Tianjin case negotiations may therefore result in a complete breakdown. (Domei News Agency dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the main unresolved parts of the Anglo-Japanese conference, the removal of anti-Japanese Chinese employees from the Public Works Bureau, the prohibition of the use of legal tender within the concession, and the handover of Chinese silver reserves are currently in a standoff and will be resolved at the sixth conference on the 31st. However, to facilitate the conference, representatives of the two countries held separate meetings on the morning of the 29th in an attempt to break the deadlock. For example, Major General Muto, the local army representative of the Japanese side, visited British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie and Consul General Butler at the British Embassy at 10:00 a.m. that day for a one-and-a-half-hour cordial discussion. Consul Tanaka, Lieutenant Colonel Tanaka, and Major Ota also consulted at the residence of a Foreign Ministry official on the same day regarding the attitude to be taken. In addition, Consul Butler made a private visit to the residence of a Foreign Ministry official at 11:00 a.m. Furthermore, Minister Kato and Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie also held close talks at the Tokyo Club at 10:40 a.m. From this observation, it can be seen that the representatives of the two countries are communicating frequently, and it is expected that there will be considerable progress in the sixth Anglo-Japanese conference on the 31st. (Domei News Agency dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the report submitted to the government by Sir Robert Craigie on the situation of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations, the Foreign Office will study it at the end of the week and send a new instruction by telegram to Sir Robert Craigie before Monday next week as a guideline for continuing the negotiations. (Huitong News dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the Anglo-Japanese negotiations, after British representative Sir Robert Craigie refused to accept the Japanese demands to prohibit the use of legal tender and hand over silver reserves in the British concession in Tianjin, newspapers here sharply criticized him this morning. Japanese military officials believe that if the United Kingdom does not change this stubborn attitude, Anglo-Japanese negotiations will inevitably come to a complete standstill. Japanese political figures stated that the economic requirements put forward by Japan are the basic and preliminary conditions for maintaining order in East Asia and that the United Kingdom must accept them, otherwise it will violate the spirit of the Craigie-Arita preliminary agreement. (Huitong News dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<h3>Economic Issues Submitted to Subcommittee for Discussion</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Various circles in Japan believe that although the Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Tianjin issue are not proceeding smoothly, they are still in good order. The representatives of both sides will talk separately today. As a result, it was decided to submit the economic issues to a committee, which is scheduled to meet at 9:00 a.m. on Monday. British Commercial Counselor Macleay and Tianjin Consul Herbert will be the British representatives to this committee, while the Japanese representatives will be Tianjin Consul General Tanaka, and Foreign Ministry Secretaries Aoki and Asaka. According to Japanese sources, the Tianjin Anti-British Citizens Association is becoming impatient with the slow progress of the Tokyo negotiations and has decided to convene an anti-British conference at noon on Monday at two locations in Tianjin, planning to march through the streets and gather around the British consulate. (Reuters dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of prohibiting the circulation of legal tender and the issue of the transfer of silver reserves, which have become obstacles to the Anglo-Japanese conference, Minister Kato and British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie agreed on the 29th that the two sides would select a small committee of experts familiar with the local situation to conduct basic discussions to adapt to the actual situation, so as to obtain a satisfactory compromise. The Japanese side has decided that Consul Tanaka Hikozou, Asami Kouichirou, and Aoki Morio, two Foreign Ministry officials, will be appointed to the committee, while the British side will be represented by Consul Herbert and Commercial Counselor Macleay. (Domei News Agency dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<h3>Britain Has No Right to Unilaterally Resolve the Two Demands</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the negotiations between the United Kingdom and Japan in Tokyo, Japan raised two demands: first, the silver of Chinese banks deposited in foreign banks in Tianjin should be handed over to Japan; second, the circulation of Chinese legal tender should be prohibited in the British concession in Tianjin. The United Kingdom and Japan therefore have diverging opinions. Informed sources here recently explained Britain's position on this matter, saying that Britain acknowledges that it has no right to resolve these two demands unilaterally. As for the first item, French banks also hold silver from Chinese banks, and Britain cannot make any decision before exchanging views with the French government. As for the second item, since the United Kingdom and France have a relationship with it, other countries that maintain interests in China are also concerned. The British government cannot unilaterally deal with it. It seems that a new instruction will be sent by telegram to British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie in accordance with this viewpoint. In this way, it is already clear that the British government does not want to thoroughly discuss the two demands made by Japan, nor does it want to involve issues related to general policies, and even less does it want to make any unilateral solutions. (Havas dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<h3>Various Circles in China Advise Britain to Stop Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Since Britain announced the contents of the Craigie-Arita Agreement on the 25th, Chinese people have been extremely concerned. Judging from Britain's attitude towards the Far East in the past, it cannot be regarded as a failure. Although Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax have repeatedly stated in Parliament that Britain's policy towards China has not changed, there are still many worries about the trend of negotiations in Tokyo. Moreover, the Japanese are actively inciting anti-British actions while claiming that the negotiations are proceeding smoothly. In this situation, it can be seen that Japan has no sincerity towards Britain. Therefore, according to experts, Britain hopes to obtain Japan's understanding in the Tokyo negotiations in order to prevent its interests in China from being further damaged, which is tantamount to quenching thirst with plums. Moreover, Japan's fundamental policy towards Britain is to gradually undermine its position in the Far East, with no room for compromise with Britain. If Britain continues to negotiate, Japan will never be satisfied unless Britain succumbs and surrenders. It is reported that various circles in China are currently discussing ways to advise Britain to immediately stop the Tokyo negotiations and not compromise with Japan, to take parallel action with the United States, and to resolutely implement decisive measures against Japan to promote its awakening. This movement is currently being discussed by all parties and deserves special attention. (Dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) People here are quite pleased to hear the news that the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo have diverged on the monetary system issue. Various Chinese organizations have now begun a movement to persuade Britain to stop the Tokyo negotiations, saying that such negotiations are not only useless but also damage British interests and prestige in the Far East. The Chinese believe that since differences of opinion have arisen on the monetary system issue, there is hope that the Anglo-Japanese negotiations will be suspended. (Reuters dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) This morning, the Chongqing Lianhe Ribao published an editorial urging Britain to immediately suspend the Tokyo negotiations, saying that attempts to resolve disputes with Japan through negotiations are doomed to failure. If reasonable discussions and diplomatic negotiations could resolve disputes with Japan, why would the war against China have occurred, and the conferences of the League of Nations and at the Hague should have resolved them long ago. The suspicions of the people of Britain, the Commonwealth, the British people, and British friends regarding Britain's lack of resolve after the Munich Conference are now deepened by the announcement of the Anglo-Japanese compromise. This greatly damages Britain's prestige among the countries of the world. (Reuters dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<h3>While Tokyo Negotiations Proceed, Britain Temporarily Refrains from Proposing Treaty Abolition, Still Cooperating Closely with the United States, Determined to Uphold Interests in China</h3>
<p>(London) Last night, authorities explained Britain's Far East policy to reporters, indicating that while negotiations are underway in Tokyo, Britain will avoid abolishing the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. However, after the Tokyo negotiations, should they fail, the British government will follow the United States in abolishing the treaty. It is said that the US action has prompted Britain to consider similar retaliatory action, but Britain is unwilling to disrupt the success of the Tokyo negotiations. Although the US move was sudden and not consulted with Britain beforehand, the two countries are still cooperating closely in the Far East. Labour Party member Mr. Baker will request Mr. Chamberlain to explain the US action at the House of Commons meeting next Monday, and also ask Mr. Chamberlain to clearly answer whether Japan has requested Britain to stop supporting Chinese legal tender. (July 29, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(London) After the US government officially announced the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, individuals close to the government here openly stated that the 1911 Anglo-Japanese treaty may also be declared abolished. It was said that although Britain is willing to reach a compromise with Japan, it is determined to uphold its interests in China and cannot tolerate the increasingly expanding anti-British movement. British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, raised this issue with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita on July 21. Subsequently, the British government repeatedly protested to the Japanese government regarding the anti-British movement and the attitude of the Japanese military authorities in North China, hoping that the Japanese government and military authorities would exercise restraint; otherwise, Britain may retaliate by declaring the abolition of the treaty. In short, Japan's true intentions can be discerned when the economic issues, especially the issue of silver deposits in Tianjin, are submitted for discussion. (July 29, Havas)</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Intensifies Blockade of South China Coast</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to an official gazette published by the Hong Kong government, the Japanese Navy is gradually intensifying the blockade of the Chinese coast in South China, and is laying mines outside the ports of Swabue, Yulin Bay, Qiongzhou, Tongshan, Jianfeng, Shaha, Sanduao, and Wenzhou.

<h3>The United States Pursues an Independent Policy in the Far East, Maintaining a Watchful Attitude Towards the Situation in China, Treaty Abolition Issue Not Consulted with Britain and France in Advance</h3>
<p>(Washington) When Secretary of State Hull met with the press today, reporters raised numerous questions about US-Japan relations. Secretary of State Hull remained extremely reserved and refused to comment on the repeated statements made by the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman. US political figures said that this statement was not worth taking seriously. The State Department remained unmoved by the last statement, which stated that the Japanese government did not intend to force the United States to recognize the new situation in China before a new US-Japan treaty was concluded, and maintained a silent attitude. Observers believe that the US attitude towards Japan and what actions the US will take in the Far East depend on (1) how American public opinion reacts and (2) how the evolution of the Far East situation affects purely American interests. Furthermore, Secretary of State Hull confirmed to reporters that the US government authorities did not discuss the announcement of the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with the British and French ambassadors, indicating that the United States wants to pursue an independent and autonomous policy in the Far East, and make decisions purely based on how the situation in the Far East affects American interests. In terms of public opinion, whenever the government adopts a method of international cooperation, suspicion is always shown, and now it is easier to support an independent policy. (July 28, Havas)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull declared last night that the US government has exchanged views with Britain and France regarding the Far East issue. Hull also stated that the US government did not consult with Britain and France before abolishing the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. This decision by the democratic countries to exchange views on the Far East issue is merely a general matter. (July 29, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt did not comment on the US abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation in his conversation with reporters yesterday. (July 29, Associated Press)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Considers Diplomatic Policy, Takes a Wait-and-See Attitude Towards the United States, No Intention to Lodge Protest</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a statement issued by semi-official sources, the inner cabinet meeting composed of Prime Minister Hiranuma, Army Minister Itagaki, Navy Minister Yonai, and Finance Minister Ishiwata will be held recently to discuss diplomatic policy in order to adapt to the principles determined by the Japanese government on June 5 regarding the European situation. According to the minutes of the cabinet meeting on June 5, Hiranuma met with the Emperor and presented the "Basic Plan for Japan's Policy on the European Situation." When Soviet Russia bombed the South Manchurian Railway, Army Minister Itagaki requested on July 18 that an inner cabinet meeting be convened immediately, saying that the Soviet bombing was clearly related to the European situation, and that Japan needed to take "appropriate measures." Political figures believe that the meeting will have a detailed discussion on this issue. (July 29, Haitong)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the United States announced the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, Japanese political and financial figures have remained silent and have not expressed any opinions on the outcome of this move, but their dissatisfaction can be glimpsed from the phrase "sudden and regrettable American step." When the Japanese cabinet met yesterday, it seemed to have decided not to lodge a protest with Washington, but to wait and see the background of this move and make a decision after observing clearly. (July 29, Haitong)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the United States suddenly abolished the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, the Japanese public has been extremely shocked, because in the past two years, the Tokyo government has deliberately kept the news of the repeated US protests secret, and the general public originally thought that US-Japan relations were as good as ever. Viscount Okabe, a member of the House of Peers, said, "The US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation has been signed and implemented for more than 25 years. We are shocked to hear the news that the US has suddenly announced its abolition." Okabe also speculated that the authorities in London and Washington "must have some kind of understanding." Okabe was working at the Japanese Embassy in the United States when the US and Japan signed the treaty in 1911. (July 29, Associated Press)</p>
<h3>US Treaty Abolition Suits the Timing, Ambassador Koo Speaks</h3>
<p>(Paris) Chinese Ambassador to France Dr. Wellington Koo stated that the US government's abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation was a timely and encouraging action, saying that the US note to Japan showed that the US could not condone the repeated violations of treaty rights and the humiliation suffered by the American people without seeking a way to resist. This is a statesmanlike step. The abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation has a far-reaching force to promote the happiness of the world. The Chinese people are now greatly excited to see that the principles they are fighting to uphold are now also supported by other countries and know that their efforts to seek a more orderly world are not isolated and helpless. (July 29, Reuters)</p>
<h3>European Newspaper Observations on the Impact of US Treaty Abolition, British Attitude Strengthened as a Result, Germany and Italy Feel Significant Stimulus</h3>
<p>(London) The morning newspapers here have continued to comment on the US government's abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. The diplomatic correspondent of the London Times declared, "The move by the United States is largely sufficient to show that the policies pursued by Britain and the United States on the Far East issue, although they may not want to be mutually binding, have parallel interests. As for the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, while the Tianjin issue is being negotiated in Tokyo, there is no time to consider the issue of abolition, but when the British authorities reconsider the Far East issue, if they find it necessary to take the same actions as the United States, this is not entirely impossible. The general public here does not shy away from saying it." The Daily Express reported, "This move by the US government is welcomed by the entire public opinion here, and Britain is also considering taking similar actions." The Daily Telegraph reported, "According to news received here last night, the negotiations between Britain and Japan in Tokyo have been disrupted by the issue of prohibiting the circulation of Chinese legal tender in the Tianjin concessions and the disposal of all silver deposits in Chinese banks in the concessions. British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie has asked the government authorities for instructions. Regarding the issue of legal tender, the British side believes that the legal tender currently circulating in the two Tianjin concessions is recognized by the Chinese government, and the Chinese government is the legitimate government recognized by Britain. The Japanese side said that it intends to replace the legal tender with banknotes issued by the 'North China United Reserve Bank.' The current attitude of Britain is sufficient to hinder it. As for the US treaty abolition, it is welcomed by the British government. The policies pursued by the governments of Britain and the United States on the Far East issue are largely parallel, and here is another proof of this. For example, whether the current Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between Britain and Japan should be abolished, as the US government has done, Britain has repeatedly considered it in recent months. As of today, although there is no symbol of taking this kind of action, if the negotiations between Britain and Japan in Tokyo cannot proceed smoothly, the British government may have to notify Japan that Britain has various methods of pressure that can be used." The Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, stated, "The talks between Britain and Japan in Tokyo will inevitably cause difficulties as soon as Japan puts forward its main demands. It is to be expected by the general public, but the original position of Britain has been greatly strengthened by the US President Roosevelt's treaty abolition, which is also undeniable." (July 29, Havas)</p>
<p>Partial Change in the Far Eastern Balance of Power</p>
<p>(Paris) The morning newspapers here have continued to comment on the US government's abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. The right-wing L'Ordre reported, "President Roosevelt's move may partially change the balance of power among the powers in the Far East. As for the overall event, there is a special point to note, that is, the United States has adopted a detached attitude towards Japan's blockade of the British concession in Tianjin. It is said that the British government has sounded out the United States, preparing to take a tough stance, but has not received encouragement. At this moment, since the United States has taken action, the basis of the Anglo-Japanese alliance (July 21) will be changed as a result, and the tone of British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, will also be stronger." L'Ère Nouvelle reported, "German Chancellor Hitler's sudden return to Berlin may be related to the US treaty abolition. Some foreign observers firmly believe that this move by the United States, in the eyes of those around Chancellor Hitler, will have a huge impact on the Berlin-Rome Axis. Chancellor Hitler himself clearly believes that if a war breaks out in Europe, the United States will take action in the Far East, and Germany's ally, Japan, has been greatly weakened and is unable to cope with the United States and the Soviet Union at the same time."

<p>(Paris) French newspapers attach great importance to the US abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. Le Temps said that Washington is now launching a diplomatic offensive against Japanese imperialism, and what it is adopting is a radical plan to touch the weakest point of the Eastern empire. Some believe that the United States wants to make a powerful gesture to restore the situation in the minds of the people in the East, which has changed due to Britain's willingness to show weakness, which is noteworthy. American public opinion is now unanimously supporting the policies of President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull. (July 29, Reuters)</p>
<p>The United States Shows the Spirit of Sanctions</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian journalist Guido Gaita (known as a spokesman for Prime Minister Mussolini) recently published an article in "Il Giornale d'Italia" criticizing the US government's announcement of the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, calling it "President Roosevelt's rash action" and "the manifestation of the spirit of sanctions." He said, "President Roosevelt is implementing an oligarchy by dictatorial means, and he should be fully responsible for this treaty abolition. Generally speaking, the United States had agreed with the British government before deciding to take this action. When President Roosevelt suddenly took an anti-Japanese attitude for personal political reasons, Britain was outwardly yielding to the Japanese government and secretly promoting the same policy. The collusion between Britain and the United States can be seen from this. In Japan, it is well known that Britain's policy towards China has never changed, so there are sufficient reasons to consider the situation before and after and not to lift the blockade of the British concession in Tianjin for the time being."

<p>On the US Abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation</p>
<h3>International Relations Expert Zhang Zhongfu Expresses Opinions, Although the Treaty Abolition Will Not Take Effect Until Six Months Later, Congress Can Immediately Prohibit Arms Shipments to Japan</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The US government's sudden announcement of the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation has shocked the world. In order to understand the trend of the US abolition of the treaty and its future role, a reporter visited international relations expert Dr. Zhang Zhongfu, who provided a detailed analysis and expressed his opinions as follows: The US government notified Japan on July 26 of the abolition of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation concluded by the US and Japan in 1911. This move should be welcomed by the governments and peoples of peace-loving countries. Japan's aggression in China in recent years not only threatens China's survival, but also endangers the rights and interests of friendly countries in China and their positions in the Pacific. The implementation of Japan's continental policy must exclude the rights and interests of European and American countries in China, and Japan's ambition is not limited to conquering China. If Japan can conquer China, it will then use China's human and material resources to achieve the illusion of dominating the Pacific and conquering the world. People with insight in countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union are very aware of Japan's ambition. However, countries such as Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are inevitably somewhat constrained in the Far East due to the thorny European issue. At present, the only country that is not subject to any constraints internationally is the United States. For the sake of the United States itself, the dignity of the treaty, and world peace, the United States has the necessity to implement economic sanctions against Japan. Once the United States stops supplying Japan with military supplies and raw materials, and stops importing Japanese goods, Japan's war of aggression will not be able to continue. Mr. Pittman and other US congressmen have proposed resolutions to ban exports to Japan. Mr. Vandenberg has expressed his desire to abolish the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation in the Congress. (Note: Vandenberg is a Republican candidate for the next presidential election.) The abolition of the treaty is the power of the executive branch. President Roosevelt, seeing that American public opinion is unanimous and that legislators are advocating sanctions against Japan, resolutely abolished the US-Japan treaty. Japan's aggressive actions in the Far East in recent years have long violated the text and spirit of the treaties signed by the two countries. The US government can disregard whether the ban on exports to Japan conflicts with the 1911 treaty and implement retaliation or sanctions against Japan. However, once this treaty is abolished, the US will have no legal basis to criticize any retaliatory or sanctioning measures taken against Japan in the future. Although the treaty abolition will not take effect until six months later, Mr. Pittman's resolution to ban exports to Japan does not need to wait until six months later to be passed, because the resolution only authorizes the president to implement the embargo on countries that violate the Nine-Power Treaty, and does not specify the date of implementation. In fact, the power of the US Congress is extremely large. Even if the US-Japan treaty has not been abolished, the US Congress can ban the export of military supplies such as scrap iron, coal, and oil to Japan for reasons of national defense. Congress can also follow the precedent of the Johnson Act and pass a bill based on the reason that Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty to ban the export of all goods. Congress can also prohibit the borrowing of US funds to Japan (ordinary loans and credit loans) in accordance with the Johnson Act because Japan has violated the treaty signed with the United States. Before Congress has a resolution, the US president also has the power to take measures that are more forceful than this statement, except for war. In fact, the United States has adopted such measures to protect its trade interests. According to Section 303 of the US Tariff Act of 1930, the US president has the power to increase the corresponding import tax on the goods of any country, especially those that subsidize goods sold to the United States. President Roosevelt's previous method of increasing import taxes on German imports was based on this power. Section 309 of the same law stipulates that the president has the right to prohibit the import of all goods made by forced labor or prisoner labor. Section 337 of the same law stipulates that the US president may not allow the import of goods from countries that adopt special unfair trade practices. In 1934, the US tariff law stipulated that if any country discriminates against the export goods, the US president should refuse to grant it most-favored-nation treatment. This regulation has been implemented against Germany. If the country continues to discriminate against US export goods, the US president has the right to increase tariffs or even ban imports on goods imported into the US from that country under Section 338 of the 1930 Tariff Act. In addition, the US president can also use the silver purchase law to help friendly countries with balancing funds and punish countries that threaten US security and interests. The US president can also provide loans (ordinary loans and credit loans) to countries that have been invaded through the Export-Import Bank. In summary, although the abolition of the US-Japan treaty will not take effect until six months later, the US Congress has good reasons to ban the export of military supplies to Japan and does not have to wait until six months later. Although the US president has no right to ban exports to Japan, the US president still has the right to adopt a method of persuasion, such as the previous method of persuading US businessmen not to sell aircraft to Japan. As for raising import taxes on Japanese goods, or banning the import of Japanese goods, or lending money to China, or using balancing funds, and buying laws to help China, the US president now has this power. Some people (probably some isolationists in the United States) believe that once the above-mentioned measures are implemented, Japan will take retaliatory measures, and mutual retaliation will make war between the US and Japan inevitable. This statement seems to be true but is not. Many of the existing US laws discriminate against other countries for some special reasons, such as the Johnson Act and most-favored-nation treatment, etc., but no war has occurred with other countries because of this. Moreover, Japan's strength has been more than half depleted due to the war against China. Japan will not dare to go to war with the United States at this time. As for empty threats, they are the usual tricks of fascist countries and are not worth fearing. In addition, the US government's announcement of the abolition of the US-Japan treaty is the first step in proving the US government's determination to sanction aggressors, and it also proves the progress of American public opinion. Economic retaliation and economic sanctions by the United States against Japan will eventually be implemented, and the time is not far away, because although the 1911 US-Japan treaty stipulates that "there shall be no discrimination in trade," in fact, Japan not only subsidizes its goods sold to the United States, but also often discriminates against US export goods through special unfair trade practices. In addition, Japanese labor is extremely cheap, which is tantamount to forced labor or prisoner labor, so according to the tariff laws of 1930 and 1934, the US president now has the power to raise import taxes on Japanese goods or even ban their import.

<h3>US Newspapers Advocate Anglo-American Naval Blockade of Japan, Predict US Will Ban Export of Munitions and Raw Materials to Japan</h3>
<p>(New York) The New York Daily News commented yesterday that in order to deal with Japan's continued violation of the rights of third countries in China, Britain and the United States must take joint naval blockade against Japan as retaliation. The newspaper continued that the US government's abolition of the US-Japan treaty was purely for self-defense, and said that the United States will be the second target in Japan's policy of expelling foreigners' rights in China, so this move by the Americans is purely for self-defense. It is reported that the newspaper has the largest circulation in the United States, and the Philadelphia "Inquirer" predicts that the US government will soon ban the transportation of munitions and raw materials to Japan. The newspaper also praised President Roosevelt's "courageous" actions against Japan. The Boston "Globe" supported the US abolition of the US-Japan treaty, saying that in the situation where Japan is constantly destroying the lives and property of American citizens in China, there is no need to continue friendly relations with it. The St. Louis "Globe-Democrat" commented that the US government's abolition of the US-Japan treaty was a demonstration to Japan. The Kansas City "Star" said, "It will be very interesting to observe how Japan deals with it." The Los Angeles "Times" said that this move by the US government is not an "unfriendly" move towards Japan. The US government only means that the Japanese will no longer be able to continue their atrocities in the Far East. (July 29, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(New York) According to today's editorial in the New York World-Telegram, the future actions of the United States depend entirely on the actions of Japan. Economic sanctions, although a resolute action in the United States, are a serious blow to Japan. At the same time, the number of Americans who support economic sanctions now accounts for the majority. The World-Telegram said that if Japan is willing to appease the anger of the United States, it can only change its "new order in East Asia." The New York Herald Tribune, adopted by the Democratic Party, said that the United States definitely wants Japan to have a "sudden feeling." Only in this way can Japan feel that the intention of the United States is not only to revise the treaty, but also has another meaning. It also said that there is a long time between the US notice of treaty abolition and the time when it takes effect, so the Japanese military will definitely not sit idly by during this period. Therefore, without waiting to test whether it can take effect, the Japanese military will take retaliatory measures. (July 29, Associated Press)</p>
<h3>British Approved Credit Loans Totalling 60 Million Pounds Sterling, Including New Loans to China</h3>
<p>(London) King George of England yesterday approved the Overseas Trade Guarantees Act, which authorizes the government to lend friendly countries credit loans up to £60,000,000. Britain has agreed to lend Poland £8,000,000 in this amount, and China hopes to obtain £3,000,000. (July 29, Associated Press)</p>

<h3>Repercussions of US Abrogation of the Japan-US Treaty, Signing of New German-Japanese Trade Agreement, Strengthening of Anti-Comintern Axis Ties, Germany's Move Intended to Reassure Japan</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to official announcements, the commercial agreement between Japan and Germany was signed this afternoon and will take effect on October 1 this year. The main points are to increase trade between Germany and Japan through a clearing system, and for Germany to provide credit to Japan. An official communique stated, "This agreement will further strengthen the commercial relationship between the two countries within the scope of current friendship." (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to the new German-Japanese agreement signed yesterday, Japan will increase imports from Germany by 80 million Reichsmarks worth of goods, and Germany will also increase imports from Japan by 60 million Reichsmarks. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry recently stated that negotiations for the German-Japanese commercial agreement have been ongoing for nearly two years. It was now signed in Berlin. The Japanese representative was Oshima, the Japanese ambassador to Germany, and the German representative was Walter, a German economic expert. This agreement should increase the volume of German-Japanese trade and enhance economic ties between the two countries. Japan can obtain more supplies of various goods needed in peacetime or wartime, and Germany can purchase more Japanese seafood, agricultural products, and so on. As a result, economic relations within the anti-communist cooperation will become closer. It is gratifying that the Anti-Comintern Axis is gradually strengthening in economic and other aspects. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German-Japanese commercial agreement was signed and established here this afternoon. German political figures expressed extreme satisfaction and said that this was "a swift and sharp response to the United States' declaration of the abrogation of the Japan-US commercial treaty." With these improvements in German-Japanese commercial relations, the losses that Japan may suffer after the abrogation of the Japan-US commercial treaty can be fully compensated. Regarding the US abrogation of the treaty, it must have been done after obtaining the agreement of the UK. President Roosevelt likely wanted to retaliate because the amendment to the Neutrality Act had suffered a setback in Congress. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to authoritative sources, the German-Japanese commercial agreement has been under negotiation for a long time, and the timing of the signing is quite interesting. Political circles believe that this announcement actually acknowledges that the new German-Japanese agreement not only makes clear the strength and unity of the Axis powers to Britain and the world, but is also a counter-attack against the United States. The new German-Japanese agreement places economic relations between the two countries on a formal basis. Previously, economic relations between the two countries were based on "gentlemen's agreements." In the past few years, German-Japanese trade has brought Germany huge trade surpluses, and this trend continues to increase. This trend is partly due to Japan's import of large quantities of heavy industrial machinery and chemicals from Germany. On the other hand, Germany's trade with "Manchukuo" has had a large trade deficit in recent years. Although the terms of the German-Japanese agreement have not yet been announced, it has been learned that the Chinese market is still a place of free competition for both Germany and Japan. Well-informed sources claim that some clauses of the agreement regulate Japan's payment methods, which are of a technical nature, just like the payment methods stipulated between Germany and "Manchukuo." (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The commercial agreement signed by Germany and Japan has just been commented on by various newspapers here, all saying that this is a direct response to the United States' abrogation of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between the United States and Japan. The "Local Guidance Report" stated, "The United States government did not consider the consequences of this move, and it was instigated by the British government. However, Britain will soon realize that this kind of assistance from the United States is not enough to help it consolidate its position in the Far East. How it will turn out in reality will soon become clear. In other words, Britain and the United States have already created a situation that will allow the trade relations of the signatories of the Anti-Comintern Pact to develop healthily. As for the German-Japanese commercial agreement, it was signed only after thorough research. This agreement is a systematic structure, which is very different from the methods adopted by various democratic countries." The "German General News" stated, "Trade between Germany and Japan will definitely see great development. After the establishment of an agreement between Britain and Japan, negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union have been intensified. This must be paid attention to. Japan now suspects that Britain and the United States are acting in concert, and it has also begun to doubt whether Britain is sincere in establishing an agreement." (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Manchu Soybeans, Quantity Exported to Germany, Valued at 40 Million Marks in Six Months of This Year</h3>
<p>Changchun. The German ambassador to "Manchukuo" announced that from January to June of this year, the total amount of soybeans imported by Germany from "Manchukuo" was 505,700 tons, with a total value of 47,475,000 marks. (Dohmei News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>German Head of State and Foreign Minister Return to the Capital to Confer on the Current Situation, Deliberately Displaying Leisurely Demeanor, Departed from Berlin Again on the Same Day</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Head of State Hitler, who was originally in Bayreuth attending the Wagner music festival, suddenly returned to the capital yesterday at noon. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, who was originally escaping the heat in Bavaria, also returned here yesterday and went to the Chancellery to meet with Hitler and hold talks, discussing the recent international situation for a long time. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Head of State Hitler left the capital again this morning, likely returning to Bayreuth. At the same time, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also went to Salzburg again. As for what the Head of State and Foreign Minister discussed, responsible parties are completely unaware. The fact that the Head of State did not attend the free telephone exhibition being held here indicates that his return to the capital was not for this purpose. It can be asserted that, in addition, Minister of Propaganda Goebbels is in Munich presiding over the opening ceremony of the television exhibition and attending equestrian competitions, and Air Force Minister Göring is inspecting various rivers and canals by yacht. Economic Minister Funk is also on vacation. All of this is clearly intended to show the greatness of Germany's power and that the government is leisurely and carefree. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Head of State Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop suddenly returned to the capital this morning. It is expected that there will be a series of political activities here. Although the government claims that Head of State Hitler returned to the capital only to discuss various routine official duties with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, it is actually heard that it is related to the recent developments in the international situation. For example, the United States' declaration of the abrogation of the Japan-US commercial treaty, as well as the progress made in the negotiations between China, France, and the Soviet Union, have all made a deep impression on Germany. Regarding the former, Germany has swiftly signed a commercial agreement with Japan to show its reaction. The German authorities intend to prevent the people of the Anti-Comintern countries from feeling frustrated by this move by the United States, so they are eager to avoid it. In addition, the progress made in the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, with staff members of the three countries scheduled to begin talks within days, is also one of the reasons why Head of State Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop returned to the capital. German officials originally thought that the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union would continue to stall, but now they are greatly disappointed. In addition, the slow progress of the German-Soviet commercial and financial talks and the major difficulties encountered are enough to make the German authorities feel anxious. German newspapers recently ridiculed and mocked the efforts of Britain and France to approach the Soviet Union in every way, but this morning all the newspapers remained silent. They also did not publish a single word of the Soviet government's statement that the trilateral talks would continue. All of these phenomena have clues to be found in them.

<h3>Anglo-Franco-Soviet Negotiations Practically Completed, Only Minor Issues Remaining to be Resolved, Military Talks to Begin Next Week</h3>
<p>(Paris) It is heard that Foreign Minister Bonnet today, in the Cabinet meeting, explained the diplomatic situation in detail for a long time, and paid great attention to the negotiations currently underway between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. It is said that these negotiations, in terms of important points, can now be said to have been successfully completed. The only minor differences in opinion remaining concern the drafting of the "indirect aggression" clause. This is just a drafting issue and will not affect the entire negotiation. Military talks are expected to begin next week and will proceed in parallel with political talks. A British military delegation led by an air force general and a naval admiral will depart from London for Paris in the middle of next week and go to Moscow with the French military delegation led by General Doumenc. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, the staff talks between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will be held in Moscow within ten days. The form it will take has already been discussed yesterday by the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, the French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Naggiar, and the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov. Once negotiations are resumed on the 30th of this month, a concrete decision can be made to enable Prime Minister Chamberlain to make a statement in the House of Commons on the 31st. However, the rumor that the British government will appoint General Chatwyn-White as the chief representative to participate in the staff talks is unlikely to be true. The government will generally select one of the naval admirals to serve as the representative. According to the current situation, the prospects for political negotiations are quite optimistic. The statement that Prime Minister Chamberlain should issue, as well as the government's dispatch of a military delegation to Moscow, can lead to the final decision on the Anglo-Franco-Soviet political agreement. Although the question of defining "indirect aggression" has not yet been resolved, the attitude of the Soviet Union is expected to become more moderate once staff talks begin.

<h3>Chinese Government Announces, Amount of Legal Tender Issued, Totals Over 260 Billion Yuan, Cash Reserves Still Higher Than Other Countries</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chinese government announced last night that the legal tender issued by the four major Chinese banks (Central, China, Communications, Agricultural Bank of China) totaled 2,626,929,300 yuan as of the end of June. The issuance of this legal tender is backed by gold, silver, and foreign exchange valued at 1,156,088,974.33 yuan, and government-issued or guaranteed public bonds or treasury bills valued at 1,470,840,325.67 yuan. In addition, assets and short-term commercial paper deemed acceptable by the Ministry of Finance are used as reserves for the issuance of legal tender. The announcement stated that the ratio of cash and marketable securities reserves is 44 percent and 56 percent, respectively. The Central Bank issued the largest amount of legal tender, accounting for 1,048,883,145 yuan, followed by the Bank of China, which issued 703,570,740 yuan. The Bank of Communications ranked third, issuing 548,456,070 yuan, and the Agricultural Bank of China ranked last, issuing 326,019,345 yuan. The announcement stated that before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, China's legal tender cash reserve was 60 percent, which has now been reduced to 44 percent. The announcement indicated that this ratio "is still higher than the cash reserves of most countries." The decrease in cash reserves is due to the increase in the amount of legal tender issued. Before the war, the amount of legal tender issued was 1,400,000,000 yuan. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Minister of Economic Affairs Wong Wen-hao Talks, China Striving to Adjust Trade, Increase Output of Tung Oil and Tin, Obtain Foreign Exchange to Repay Loans, Plan to Conclude Agreements with Foreign Countries, Aiming to Exchange Goods for Munitions</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Minister of Economic Affairs Wong Wen-hao, who spoke to an Associated Press reporter, China is now trying to increase exports and reduce imports of luxury goods in order to strengthen its war of resistance. China's current goals are (1) to increase the output of tin in order to obtain foreign exchange, (2) to conclude barter agreements with foreign countries in order to obtain munitions, and (3) to increase the output of tung oil in order to repay foreign loans and lending. Our soldiers are now serving the country on the front lines and behind the Japanese lines. We must work in the rear to maintain and strengthen our strength. However, the biggest difficulty at present is in the organization of transportation. The current import regulations do not hinder the industrial construction of western China. First, the machines transported from the coast to the interior are now fully utilized. Second, equipment and industrial supplies have not been prohibited from being imported so far. The import bans are mostly on luxury goods, etc. The general Chinese people believe that the implementation of this point is already a bit late. China must currently avoid the outflow of funds. What China needs a month ago is not to spend much money abroad. China cannot do without foreign aid, whether it is government or private loans, they are all needed. However, up to now, very little capital has been invested in the interior. In the view of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, investing in the interior is the best policy, because the prosperity of the coastal areas is dependent on the prosperity of the interior, and this point will become more obvious when the war ends. As for modern machinery, although it can transform the interior, it cannot be obtained without foreign investment. For example, Xikang, Sichuan, and Yunnan all have copper mines. After the establishment of the Dian-Chuan Highway, the transportation problem can be solved, but the machinery for extracting silver mines must be purchased from overseas. Speaking of the barter system, Wong believes that this system will harm the interests of many countries in the world, but in wartime economy, this measure is necessary. For example, barter agreements, such as the export of tung oil to the United States, have no difficulties, because the United States has become our main customer. As for the recent restrictions on exports, although they will reduce China's trade, this is inevitable due to the war. The most affected by China's import restrictions is France, because China's luxury goods mostly come from France, but we are determined to compensate France for this loss. For example, we plan to purchase the machinery needed by various factories in Yunnan from France. In order to increase transportation convenience, the French side has agreed to increase the transportation volume of the Vietnam Railway. Wong continued, the harvest this year is very good, so there is absolutely no problem with food for the people. Although prices in the interior are currently high, especially for cloth, prices are expected to fall after the establishment of small-scale factories. The formation of industrial cooperatives is not good now, but the future is unlimited. Also, although the amount of legal tender issued in China has doubled compared to before the war, it has little impact on living standards, except for a few imported goods. At the same time, various price stabilization agencies are now doing their best to suppress prices under the guidance of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3>Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Far East Red Army Replaced, Names of 79 Military Officers Dismissed Due to Suspicion of Reactionary Activities</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Nazi Party newspaper "Völkischer Beobachter" recently reported that the Soviet government has appointed General Popov to replace General Stern as the Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Red Army. General Stern succeeded General Vasily Blyukher as the Commander of the Far Eastern Army in the late summer and early autumn of last year. It is heard that General Blyukher's censure was due to his advice. Now he is also uneasy in his position. In addition, 79 military and government officials have also been dismissed by the government, several of whom were under the command of General Blyukher, especially Deputy Commander of the Far East Red Army, General Lai Bing, and the Administrative Chief of the Ural Military District, Chevikov. Others, such as the Soviet representative to Outer Mongolia, Tairov, the leader of the Communist Youth League's Far East Branch, Ovchinikov, the former military attaché of the Embassy in the United States, Olas, and the political commissar of the Naval Academy, Rapoport, are also on the list of those dismissed this time. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) There is much speculation here about why General Stern, the commander of the 1st Special Red Banner Army stationed in the Far East, was unable to participate in person in the Naval Day parade held in Vladivostok. It is believed that General Stern may have been left in command of Soviet troops operating in Outer Mongolia. Commander Lisid served as General Stern's representative on Naval Day, but it is not known whether it is temporary or permanent. The authorities here also announced yesterday that the honorary medals of 79 officers have been stripped due to the discovery of reactionary suspicions, but there are no important government officials among them.

<h3>Swatow and Other Places Bombed, Chinese Army Controls the Chao-Shan Coastal Line, Wu Qikwei's Troops Transferred to Dongjiang</h3>
<p>Chao-Mei News, On July 20, the Japanese army attacked Shanwei, with more than a thousand casualties. The Chinese army besieged and entered Shanwei, and the Japanese army retreated to warships. Fifteen Japanese planes took turns dropping more than a hundred bombs on Shanwei city, and the nearby eighteen villages were also brutally bombed. No store in any of them was intact. After the Japanese army retreated in defeat, three planes were sent to bomb Huiyang city on the 21st. The Aotou Market in Daya Bay was bombed again on the morning of the 22nd, with more than sixty bombs dropped. On the same day, at 8:30 a.m., four Japanese planes flew into Aotou, Ping Shan, Danshui, Shenzhen, Changping from Humen.</p>
<p>Dropping bombs everywhere. At nine o'clock, another seven planes flew in, dropping bombs like rain in the sky. More than 150 people were bombed to death in the market, and men and women from the entire market scattered and fled. Japanese planes opened fire and strafed. Chijiao, only half a mile from Hong Kong, was hit by two huge bombs. People were sent to investigate the disaster. According to reports, only ruins and dilapidated buildings remain in the 200 shops on Chijiao Fishing Street, none of which are intact. Aotou is the same as Shanwei. The most famous Qingtian Hotel, Taoran and Maoran inns, and the two major tea houses, Tianran, Meilong, and Yuanfeng, and other major foreign goods companies, are all in the rubble. The bombing situation on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is also very tragic. The railway line from Shenzhen to Pinghu, Changping, and Zhangmutou is still preserved, and handcars are used for transportation. On the 21st and 22nd, three Japanese planes formed a team,</p>
<p>Scouting along the line, shooting at transport workers, and dropping bombs on places where goods were stockpiled at stations. Sometimes they flew into New Street in Hong Kong, on Daoling Mountain. On the morning of the 23rd, at about 4:00, Japanese planes appeared over Shenzhen. At 8:30 a.m., Japanese planes flew from Taiping, Dongguan, and circled over Baonan Nantou before heading towards Shenzhen and dropping bombs on the Shiji Pinghu section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. The transport workers quickly fled into the bamboo forest opposite Pinghu Station to hide. Japanese planes dropped a bomb on the bamboo forest, killing 23 people and injuring 11 people on the spot, with blood and flesh flying everywhere. The Shenzhen rescue team rushed to the scene to rescue the wounded, collect the bodies, and bury them. At 1:00 p.m., another Japanese plane flew from Guangzhou into Shenzhen and dropped six bombs on Shiji and two bombs on Hengli, causing considerable casualties. Wu Qikwei's elite troops have already</p>
<p>Transferred to the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River. On the 21st, Chih Chung-kwan, the Commissioner of the Fourth District, convened a meeting of the responsible officials from Huiyang, Haifeng, and Lufeng to discuss and decide to assist the regular army in combat, to harvest the abundant mountain rice crops early, and to transport them into the mountains for storage. In the Chao-Shan area, fierce battles have been raging for days. Inside and outside the Chaoan City Temple, the two armies have been charging back and forth. The Japanese army is guarding Jinshan, Hulu Mountain, and Zhugao Mountain. On the morning of the 20th, the Chinese army advanced south along the railway and attacked Anbu. The Japanese army retreated into Malong, where it was defeated by the Chinese ambush and retreated to Swatow. Currently, the entire Chao-Shan Railway line, from Anbu to Fengxi, is under the control of the Chinese army and civilians.</p>
<h3>In Memory of a True Friend of China</h3>
<p>— Dr. Henninghaus   Zhao Erqian</p>
<p>Dr. Henninghaus (Dr. Henninghaus) passed away on the 20th of this month in Qingzhou, Shandong. Western newspapers in this city, such as the North China Daily News on the 25th, the French Shanghai Daily on the 26th, and the German Far Eastern Times on the 23rd, all published obituaries, praising his noble character and contributions to this country. In addition to the praise, there was a deep sense of sorrow. At this time of national effort to build and revitalize the country, what is needed is a spirit of hard work, perseverance, and dedication until death to serve the world. Unexpectedly, this old man has passed away, leaving us behind. Recalling the past and thinking about the future, I write this short essay in the middle of summer to commemorate this foreigner who truly loved China.</p>
<p>I remember it was the summer of 1930 when I was studying at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. I often mingled with a group of international students, among whom a German classmate was the most familiar. This was because it was a small international league, with people from all countries, but without international boundaries or wars. At a tea party discussion, young Fritz, who had just returned from Germany, took out a clean white business card and gave it to me. It read "Henninghaus, Qingzhou Prefecture, Shandong." On the back were the words "Sincerely wish to visit, for this purpose only." Seeing my surprised expression, Fritz kindly said to me, "During my travels in southern Germany this summer, I met this old man. He is the bishop of Qingzhou Prefecture in China, who has lived in China for a long time and loves China deeply. When he heard me say that there were Chinese students in the distance, he asked me to bring the card to pay his respects because he had to rush back to China, otherwise, he would have come to visit." I casually treasured the card. Subconsciously, my attitude was that since he was "just speaking idly, I would just listen idly." After all, I was an unknown person, and there was no need for a great man to "sincerely" "visit." I thought Fritz was playing another trick, getting a business card from somewhere to fool around. Unexpectedly, four years later, I was working in the same educational institution as Dr. Henninghaus. Isn't this what Mr. Feng Zikai, the master of the Yuanyuantang, called "fate"?</p>
<p>Dr. Henninghaus's central undertakings in China mainly involved two aspects: education and religion. The core of his educational work was Fu Jen Catholic University in Beiping. The ultimate goal of his religious work was to cultivate a local Chinese clergy and establish a local church. These can be discussed separately:</p>
<p>Bishop Henninghaus's emphasis on education for both men and women, with the widespread establishment of schools at all levels within the Shandong diocese, is beyond description. What I want to talk about here is his relationship with Fu Jen Catholic University and his views and plans for higher education. He was one of the key bishops of the Society of the Divine Word, and served as a director of Fu Jen Catholic University alongside Hu Shi, Zhang Ji, Ma Xiangbo, and Weng Wenhao. He had great foresight and planning for the university's affairs. The development of Fu Jen in the past two years is particularly noteworthy. Historians are serious and accurate. In the section on the essential points of Fu Jen's affairs, there is the following record: "This university was founded by the Roman Catholic Church, initially entrusted to the American Benedictine Order. In 1925, Fu Jen Society was established, which was later expanded into Fu Jen Catholic University. In 1933, it was transferred to the Society of the Divine Word. The main points of expansion in the years 1937 and 1938 are listed below: 1. Establishment of graduate schools in arts and sciences. In order to meet the demand of university graduates for advanced knowledge, the university planned to establish graduate schools in arts and sciences. Preparations were completed in the spring of 1937, and the application was submitted to the Ministry for record. In June of the same year, approval was granted. The graduate school of history was established in the Faculty of Arts in 1937, and the graduate school of physics was added to the Faculty of Science in 1938. There were a total of 22 graduate students. 2. Adding female students. In March 1937, the university purchased the old Prince Gong Mansion for 199,000 national currency. The problem of the school building, which had existed for more than ten years, was temporarily solved. In September 1938, female students were added to the first year classes of the departments of arts, education, and mathematics and physics in the Faculty of Science. The eastern part of the mansion was allocated as a dormitory for the female students, managed by the Sisters of the Holy Spirit."</p>
<p>The above figures illustrate the countless material resources, talent, energy, and sacrifices invested in this university. At the same time, it also shows that success is not easy and starting a business is difficult. The entire university has grown up in hardship and struggle. Every expansion has been encouraged and promoted by Director Han, and his material and moral support is especially valuable. Therefore, can it not be said that Fu Jen's success today is due to the leadership of Han? General Foch made the following amazing argument after the end of the European War, which is worthy of reference for those engaged in education. He said: "In the past, my motto was knowledge first, conscience second. This sentence is still useful now, but I prefer to say: conscience first, knowledge second. Yes, conscience first, this is the most important thing." I believe that Henninghaus and Foch have the same feeling. He built the foundation of university education on conscience and morality, believing that education is parallel. Intellectual training is certainly important, but isn't moral education, which enables every intelligent animal to develop a perfect and noble personality, even more important? Since the Lugouqiao Incident, Fu Jen has remained a unique institution, standing firm amidst the stormy waves, and is regarded as a "surviving treasure," along with Yenching University. There are certainly many reasons for this, but its educational foundation is moral, which is of course one of the most sufficient explanations. In today's situation where universities are turned into barracks and auditoriums are used as stables, in the midst of the stormy weather, we can still hear the sound of singing. Thousands of students are fortunately safe. This is truly extraordinary. Remembering the predecessors, starting a business is difficult. Thinking about the past and the present, I can't help but shed tears.</p>
<p>In 1926, Pope Pius XI personally consecrated six Chinese bishops in Rome, changing the world's perception. Those who doubted the possibility of the existence of a local church and a local clergy no longer had any doubts. The purpose of missionaries is not to preach forever, but to cultivate a local clergy, so that the local church can be established in the local area, be deeply rooted, stable and unshakable, self-sufficient, and become an independent diocese, no longer requiring foreign aid. Now let us explore the achievements of Bishop Han's missionary work, and we can see that he has put the Pope's will into practice word by word. At present, there are more than 166,000 Catholics in the Qingzhou diocese, and more than 74,000 people who are seeking the faith. Bishop Han himself has consecrated more than 40 Chinese priests. Recently, part of the diocese has been divided to form a local Chinese diocese, which is presided over by Bishop Tian and Chinese priests. All these measures have been deeply appreciated by the Holy See in Rome. In 1932, on the occasion of Bishop Han's Golden Jubilee, he was appointed as a Papal Chamberlain Bishop. Since then, Han has become one of the key members of the Holy See. This kind of honorable promotion is truly a rare exception in the Catholic Church. At the same time, the University of Münster in Germany awarded Han an honorary doctorate in theology for his contributions to church affairs and writings. Since then, many people have called him Dr. Han. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Someone Suggests the Shanghai Municipal Council Issue a New Shanghai Currency Based on British Gold. Most Opinions Consider It Very Difficult. Chinese People All Support the Legal Tender.</h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports that a proposal to issue a Shanghai currency worth eight pence by the Shanghai Municipal Council has sparked heated discussions. Some approve, some oppose. The reporter recently investigated the shipping, commercial and banking sectors in Shanghai. Most of those questioned support the action, but opinions on the exact implementation of the plan vary greatly.</p>
<p>Convene Experts for Discussion</p>
<p>The reporter yesterday (28th) questioned the manager of a major import and export company in Shanghai, who said that this was a great idea. He was very happy to see the implementation of the plan, but he was afraid that in terms of expertise, the new currency could not be issued. The meaning of this plan is obviously to give us a currency based on British gold, but are we not better off taking this new currency in the current chaotic financial situation? Everyone answered "yes", so he hoped that experts would convene as soon as possible, without delay, and try to make this change a reality.</p>
<p>Taxpayers Will Definitely Oppose</p>
<p>An official of the Shanghai Municipal Council told the reporter that, in his private opinion, the Shanghai currency is beneficial to the welfare of the Shanghai Municipal Council, but the council would be happy to hear that taxpayers would undoubtedly oppose it, because the income of most taxpayers is in legal tender, and the new currency with an exchange rate of eight pence would increase their tax amount by one. The reporter asked, but if the legal tender continues to fall, and the Shanghai Municipal Council's contracts are mostly calculated in pounds sterling, will there not also be a loss? The official replied that if the legal tender continues to fall, it may be so, but he is not an expert. If the expert decides that the plan can be implemented, then he thinks it is a great idea.</p>
<p>Shipping Companies Think It Will Facilitate Freight</p>
<p>A shipping company, when asked about this matter, replied that a new currency based on British money would be beneficial to his shipping company and ultimately benefit the public. Currently, the company's freight is settled in Hong Kong dollars, so the company's customers have to buy Hong Kong dollars, which are also based on British gold. The merchant concluded by asking, why would a Shanghai currency that could greatly simplify the company's operations generate insurmountable difficulties?</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Are Considering It</p>
<p>A pharmaceutical manufacturer also praised the proposed new currency. According to him, currently, he has to set the price of his manufactured drugs in British gold, and when selling, he converts the British gold into the legal tender paid by the customer according to the exchange rate. The legal tender he gets cannot be exchanged, and the exchange rate may continue to fall, resulting in losses, etc., which may occur.</p>
<p>Bankers Say It Will Be Opposed</p>
<p>The reporter then asked a senior staff member of a bank in Shanghai about this matter, who said that this idea would be very good if it was not opposed by all sectors in China and Japan when it was implemented, but there are tens of millions of yuan of legal tender circulating in Shanghai. How do you think this huge amount can be exchanged? The Shanghai Municipal Council cannot issue this currency by itself, but must have a large bank do it. He is sure that if the Chinese and Japanese governments do not oppose it, one of the larger banks here is prepared to consider it and issue the new currency. He feels that although there will be some inconveniences, at least as far as foreigners are concerned, those who benefit from this currency will be very numerous.</p>
<p>Most Chinese Depend on Legal Tender</p>
<p>According to another argument that this plan cannot be implemented, even if most Chinese people depend on legal tender, they are not greatly affected except for paying higher prices for taxes, utilities, and imported goods they need. He advocated the establishment of a committee of experts, and hoped that the new currency would be issued as soon as possible without delay.</p>
<p>A Merchant Did Not Express an Opinion</p>
<p>According to one of Shanghai's leading merchants, he has not given much thought to this idea, but when the reporter asked him for a better way to solve the current critical financial problems here, he said that he was not an expert and could not respond.</p>
<h3>Four British Soldiers Detained by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Released After Three Hours of Negotiation by Officers</p>
<p>Barbed wire has been set up near the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Bazilu to prohibit traffic. At the same time, there are Japanese soldiers stationed on the north side, while the North Jiangxi Road area is a British garrison, so British soldiers are also stationed on the south end. At about 4:30 PM yesterday, a truck from the British garrison, carrying four British soldiers, drove through the barbed wire area. For some reason, a verbal misunderstanding suddenly occurred with the Japanese sentries there, and the military vehicle and the four British soldiers were detained by the Japanese sentries because neither side would give in. At that time, the situation suddenly became tense. After talks between officers from both sides, the situation was resolved. The military vehicle and the four British soldiers drove back to the British military camp at about 7:00 PM in the evening.</p>
<h3>Japanese Man Ogawa Killed by Ding's Troops</h3>
<p>In Northeast Zhalin</p>
<p>Ogawa Wakao, a Japanese national and police instructor of the Fengxian branch of the Shanghai Special Affairs Agency, was suddenly attacked by dozens of members of Ding Xishan's guerrilla force in the vicinity of Daoyuan Town, northeast of Zhalin, Fengxian on the 26th of this month. At that time, Ogawa and others fought with Ding's troops. As a result, Ogawa was wounded and died on the spot. When the Japanese garrison from Zhalin received the news and went to aid, Ding's troops had already withdrawn. The Japanese side transported Ogawa's body to Shanghai on the 27th. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the Japanese side held a farewell ceremony at the Xiben Yuan Temple on Zhapu Road. The pseudo "Shanghai Mayor" Fu Xiao'an and others all attended.</p>
<h3>The Lun Chang Labor Strike Remains Deadlocked</h3>
<p>Workers Are About to Run Out of Food, the Situation Is Extremely Miserable</p>
<p>The strike at the Lun Chang Textile Factory, a British-owned company in Pudong, has been going on for two months. Because the factory's attitude is stern and it refuses to accept unreasonable conditions that are not related to the workers themselves, it is still difficult for the pseudo authorities to resolve the situation. Some workers previously tried to automatically return to work, but were prevented from doing so. The pseudo authorities also said they were willing to provide relief funds to maintain their livelihoods, but due to current economic difficulties, the funds have not been issued for a long time, resulting in workers running out of food, and the situation is extremely miserable.</p>
<h3>Zhaofeng Park Brass Band Concert</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's band is scheduled to hold a brass band concert in Zhaofeng Park from 5:30 PM to 7:00 PM on the 30th (weather permitting). The program includes seven items.</p>
<h3>Good News Spreads Frequently, the Financial Market Becomes More Stable, Foreign Exchange Continues to Rise, Securities Rise, Gold Falls</h3>
<p>Since the United States abolished the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty and the Soviet Union loaned US$150 million, it is generally believed that the international situation will change and be beneficial to China's anti-Japanese war. As a result, the Shanghai financial market has improved and stabilized, rumors have ceased, and people's hearts are at peace. The details are as follows, obtained by a "New Life News" reporter from the market: (1) Although the British exchange rate quoted by the British HSBC Bank in the black market for foreign exchange is four pence, and the U.S. exchange rate is 7.75 yuan, the actual market rate has continued to rise, calculated at four pence three seven five for the British exchange rate and 8.5625 yuan for the U.S. exchange rate. Swap arbitrage has decreased from one jiao to seven fen. (2) After the gold black market opened yesterday morning, due to the easing of the black market foreign exchange, the decline was very severe. The closing price was 3,595 yuan, the bank quoted price dropped to 365 yuan, and the new market price was 363 yuan. (3) After the securities black market opened yesterday morning, it rose sharply across the board. Unified A, D, and E each rose four jiao, B rose eight jiao, and C rose six jiao. (4) The exchange draft discount has tended to stabilize, and was around 250 yuan yesterday, similar to the previous day, with no significant change.</p>
<h3>Principal and Interest of the Unified Public Bonds Will Be Paid Starting Tomorrow. Shanghai Will Pay in Installments by Draft. The Order Is Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Today or Tomorrow.</h3>
<p>Since customs revenue in the occupied areas was intercepted, the Ministry of Finance stipulated the method of repaying bonds guaranteed by customs duties from now on, that is, no more overdrafts will be given. As a result, the principal and interest of the Unified Public Bonds due at the end of July were forced to be temporarily suspended. However, the four banks of the Central Bank, the China Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank allowed discounting and borrowing for the sake of stabilizing the market. Chongqing will pay in full, and Shanghai and other ports will pay in six installments. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chongqing Pays Once, Shanghai Pays in Six Installments</p>
<p>The reporter of the "New Life News" learned from the Central Bank yesterday that the four banks of the Central Bank, the China Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank have allowed discounting and borrowing for the seventh installment of principal and interest of the Unified Public Bonds due on July 31. The method is that the Chongqing head office will pay in full, and Shanghai and other ports will pay in six installments, one installment per month. The payment procedure is roughly the same as the sixth installment, but the "permit for exchange" is changed to "discount certificate." The Shanghai branch has prepared the payment procedures and will implement them after receiving the telegram from the head office.</p>
<p>Payment Will Be Made by Draft or Check</p>
<p>As of last night, the telegram for payment had not yet arrived in Shanghai. It is expected that it will arrive in Shanghai today or tomorrow morning. Discounting and borrowing payments can be handled as scheduled tomorrow (ie, July 31). However, the head office has not yet issued an order for whether the payment will be in cash or in Shanghai's common drafts. However, it is expected that the payment will be in drafts. The paying agencies are the Central Bank, the China Bank, and the Bank of Communications. The total amount of principal and interest of the Unified Public Bonds is 56,600,350 yuan.</p>
<p>Unified Public Bonds Rose Sharply Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai securities black market rose sharply in all Unified Public Bonds after the U.S. abolished the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty and the Soviet Union's huge loan was successful. Yesterday's closing prices were as follows: (1) Class A 54 yuan, up four jiao; (2) Class B 45.1 yuan, up eight jiao; (3) Class C 43.2 yuan, up six jiao; (4) Class D 42.3 yuan, up four jiao; (5) Class E 42.65 yuan, up four jiao.</p>
<h3>Gao Guanwu Was Attacked Again</h3>
<p>The Murderer Escaped Safely</p>
<p>Gao Guanwu, the "Mayor of the Nanjing Reformed Government," was once poisoned while drinking at a banquet at the Japanese Consulate. On the morning of the 26th, when the "Mayor" Gao was passing through the Confucius Temple area, he was attacked again by a burly man who fired seven or eight shots in a row. The burly man, seeing that his purpose had been achieved, escaped safely. After the incident, a suspect was arrested in a hotel in the south of the city.</p>
<h3>After the Arrest of Thugs, the Concession Tightened Searches. A Man Named Yang Was Not Sent to Court Yesterday. The Case Is Serious and Requires Careful Investigation.</h3>
<p>The "China-U.S.-Japan Daily" in Shanghai received 19 threatening letters a few days ago, ordering the newspaper's key employees to resign within three days, promising that they would receive idle pay after leaving their jobs, or they would be assassinated at their residences. The addresses of each person were also indicated on the letters. It is now heard that the police are taking great precautions against this terrorist movement. Therefore, the site of the "China-U.S.-Japan Daily" has been protected by a large number of plainclothes police to prepare for any unexpected events. In addition, the stopping of cars is not allowed on Avenue Edward VII in front of the building. Also, at the intersection of the "Ta Wan Pao," "Ta Lu Pao" and "The Times," a patrolman has been specially assigned to be stationed permanently.</p>
<p>Confiscated Handguns, Arrested Many People</p>
<p>At 4:45 PM yesterday (28th), the police suddenly saw a person dressed in Western clothes, carrying a package, which was very heavy, so they urgently ordered the elevator to stop and arrested him. Upon opening the package, two Mauser pistols and 400 rounds of ammunition were found. After the thug was arrested, he was sent to the Central Police Station. Under interrogation, he claimed that it was for self-defense. After further interrogation, he said that he was an employee of a company near the "Ta Lu Pao". For this reason, all the employees of the company were arrested yesterday.</p>
<p>The Thugs' Plan Is Clearly Visible</p>
<p>According to the police's speculation, the windows of the company overlook the editorial department of the "China-U.S.-Japan Daily," and there is also a small alley there, where the assault case happened last week. According to the intentions of the thugs, it seems that they wanted to fire guns from the window, or invade the newspaper office from the small alley. Although the small alley was closed by the police after the incident, the thugs could still abandon their guns and escape from the door of the "Ta Lu Pao". Also, according to a reporter from "Shanghai Light News," the defendant in the case, a Mr. Yang, was not sent to the Special First Court for trial yesterday morning. The police are still conducting a thorough investigation. A Western newspaper reported that the information on the investigation was inaccurate.</p>
<p>The Major Case Last Week Shocked the City</p>
<p>Since the "China-U.S.-Japan Daily" and "Ta Wan Pao" on Avenue Edward VII, Chang Geng Lane, were suddenly attacked by thugs on Saturday night, resulting in a fierce fight between the detectives and bandits, the number of deaths and injuries was more than 20. Although the police arrested seven suspects, including Shen Yufei, after the incident and sent them to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention, as reported by this newspaper, this action was obviously a large-scale organized and planned operation. Therefore, to prevent it from happening again, the police have specially taken strict precautions in the vicinity of the newspaper offices.</p>
<p>A Man Was Arrested and Taken to the Police Station</p>
<p>Before 4:45 PM the day before yesterday, a man named Yang, holding a paper package, looked flustered and entered the "The Times" Building at 160 Avenue Edward VII. While waiting for the elevator to go upstairs, the doorman and police officers of the building noticed that his appearance was suspicious, so they stepped forward to search him. They found two handguns and many rounds of ammunition in the paper package held by the man and took him to the police station. According to him, he was going to the Dafeng Customs Brokerage Company in Room 319 of the building. After investigation, a rifle and many rounds of ammunition were seized in the Dafeng company.</p>
<p>Still Under Investigation, Not Sent to Court</p>
<p>According to Dafeng personnel, the man named Yang had rented a writing desk in the customs brokerage company to engage in customs declaration affairs. Later, detectives also arrested a suspect named Xu who was involved in the case. They are currently conducting a thorough investigation, so they were not sent to the Special First Court for trial yesterday morning. It is still difficult to know whether the two men, Yang and Xu, are related to the attack on the "China-U.S.-Japan Daily" and other cases, or to other cases, because the police are currently conducting a thorough and secret investigation.</p>
<p>British and French Authorities Conducted Searches at the Same Time</p>
<p>At about 12:00 noon yesterday, the Public Concession Police and the French Concession Police dispatched a large number of detectives to search pedestrians at the north and south ends of Avenue Edward VII. The intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Guangxi Road in the Public Concession and the area west of Avenue Edward VII and Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession were heavily guarded. The French police also parked a armored vehicle there for guard purposes, but nothing was heard to have been gained.</p>

<h3>Speculative Hoarders Dumped Their Stocks, Rice Prices Plunged Yesterday. Rice Samples from Shanghai and China Rice Entered the Market. Early Rice from Pudong Arrived in Shanghai.</h3>
<p>In order to continue to handle the adjustment and balance of people's food and reduce the burden on citizens, the Concession authorities are conducting investigations of rice stored in various godowns, reporting the owners of the goods, and distributing notices. The godowns have complied and reported the rice and the investigation started yesterday. Once the examination and approval are completed, the owners will be directly notified to quickly sell the rice in the godowns at the limited prices of 20 yuan per stone of white rice and 16 yuan per stone of other rice. Those who deliberately delay, or use malpractices such as passing off names for transfer, will be severely punished once found.</p>
<p>Market Prices Fall Back, Transactions Increase</p>
<p>The rice market has been quite chaotic in recent days, equivalent to a state of stagnation where there is a market but no transactions. Fortunately, after the joint investigation of rice in the godowns by the two Concession authorities, speculative hoarders who attempted to manipulate the market were greatly panicked and eager to sell and transfer the stocks to avoid accidents. Therefore, after the market opened yesterday morning, rice samples from Shanghai and China entered the market a lot. The market was like a "long-awaited rain after a long drought." Spot goods were flexible, and transactions between buyers and sellers increased sharply. As a result, market prices fell back. Currently, the top grade white rice has entered the 20-yuan range, and other rice has also shrunk back to 15.6 or 15.7 yuan.</p>
<p>Good Harvest This Year, Early Rice Enters the Market</p>
<p>Rice storage in Shanghai is due to domestic rice from the producing areas being illegally banned from leaving the country by the Japanese and puppet authorities, causing merchants to be unable to transport the rice and the source being cut off. Therefore, the authorities are encouraging merchants to resume transportation and trying to dredge the blockage to make up for the shortage. At this moment, the early rice harvest in various places has been reported. According to reporters, the early rice production of Pudong is 100,000 stones. This year, except for the coastal areas that suffered slight typhoon damage, the rest of the areas have a particularly good harvest, with a yield not inferior to previous years. The first batch of new rice samples was brought into the market yesterday for sale, with an opening price of 18.8 yuan and a special grade of broken rice at 19 yuan. In addition, early rice from Jiangyin such as Huangtang, Qiaoqi, and Zhutang, as well as Wuhu in Anhui Province, will also enter the market in early or late August. It is said that this year has been a bumper year due to the suitable climate.</p>
<p>The Source Increases Smoothly, There Is No Panic</p>
<p>Although domestic rice from various producing areas has been banned from leaving the country by the Japanese and puppet authorities, merchants and traders are arguing on the basis of reason and trying to dredge the transportation channels. Therefore, the quantity of the source has increased more smoothly recently than before. The amount transported to Shanghai by the Beijing-Shanghai line yesterday was five cars, and more than 1,200 packages by water. The total amount of rice arriving in Shanghai was more than 3,000 packages. Although the current inventory is not much, the early rice harvest in various places and the stock of old rice in the inland areas are becoming more and more smooth, so there is no need to worry about the people's food in the future.</p>
<h3>It Is Widely Rumored That Japanese Merchants Are Forcibly Using Puppet Currency</h3>
<p>20,000 Workers Will Be Affected, Absolutely No Acceptance in North of the Suzhou Creek</p>
<p>The English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that it is widely rumored that Japanese industrial merchants operating in western Shanghai are currently considering paying workers with Huaxing tickets, but the ratio is unknown. According to the report, the north shore of Suzhou Creek in the Public Concession does not accept Huaxing tickets. If this plan is implemented, 20,000 workers will be affected.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Changes Direction, Shanghai Can Avoid Being Hit</h3>
<p>The Climate Is Not Like Summer Heat, Epidemics Must Be Prevented</p>
<p>According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the two Pacific hurricanes have been tracked. The first new hurricane reached 26 degrees north latitude and 146 degrees east longitude at 6:00 am yesterday, and then remained stagnant and may disappear. The second hurricane had reached 24 degrees north latitude and 130 degrees east longitude at 2:00 pm yesterday. Since its direction has turned north-northeast, Shanghai has avoided being hit. The climate in Shanghai is still very cool and unlike summer heat, so it is generally expected that the autumn may be very hot. If so, epidemics must be prevented this year. Judging from the number of patients visiting various epidemic hospitals at present, the daily average is more than 1,000. In the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital alone, the number of daily outpatient visits has exceeded 500. The health threat to Shanghai citizens is extremely significant.</p>
<h3>Guerrillas Set Up Large Cannons Along the Yangtze River and Will Begin to Contend With the Japanese Army, the Japanese Spokesman Admits Clearly</h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reported that the Japanese naval spokesman said to reporters yesterday (28th) that guerrillas had set up large cannons along the Yangtze River and had begun to act. These artillery units are located between Anqing and Pukou and have repeatedly exchanged fire with Japanese warships. The mines laid by the Chinese army are being removed today. On Thursday, two mines were removed from the Shantou area. The total number of mines removed from the area has reached 35.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables the Ministry of Finance to Stop Discounting, Please Quickly Devise Effective Measures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on a letter from the Thermos Manufacturing Industry Association, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to stop the discounting, the original text is recorded as follows: (1) The Thermos Manufacturing Industry Association said that since the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, the government, in order to consolidate the foreign exchange base and prevent the escape of funds, promulgated measures to stabilize finance. At the same time, in order to take care of legitimate commerce, silver houses in the city used draft tickets to reduce the circulation of legal tender. The law was good and the intention was beautiful. Although the city's industrial and commercial circles suffered great pain, they still enthusiastically supported the national policy. Since the implementation of the draft system, the trend of discounting has risen with it. Since the Ministry of Finance issued the Ma telegram, it has risen to a huge amount of more than 200 yuan. The discounting of drafts has long been expressly prohibited, but the industrial circles have to sacrifice painfully in order to conform to the facts. At this time of the decline of all industries, why should we suffer the exploitation and manipulation of a few people again? It is proposed to forward it to the Ministry of Finance to expressly prohibit the Shanghai discounting market in order to be fair. (2) The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegrams, the Chongqing Ministry of Finance Junjian, according to the thermos manufacturing industry, the discount on Shanghai drafts has risen to 200 yuan per thousand, and the cost of purchasing materials in cash has soared. It is requested that you quickly devise effective measures to stop it. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Kan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Obstruct Foreign Vessels in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Under the Pretense of Checking for Plague, All Kinds of Obstacles Are Placed on Foreign Vessels</p>
<p>The English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that coastal vessels sailing from Shanghai and Hong Kong to Tianjin are expected to be greatly delayed, as Japanese troops have ordered passengers to undergo plague checks at Dagu at the mouth of the Haihe River. The Tianjin Shipping Company has lodged a strong protest against this order, pointing out that the order was issued by the Japanese army and not by any civil official authority. No port in the world has declared Shanghai or Hong Kong</p>
<p>Infected With Plague</p>
<p>This type of inspection is not necessary. According to shipping industry sources, as of today, there have been no cases of plague in the French Concession this year, and only one case in the Public Concession. Only when plague occurs repeatedly and becomes an epidemic can the port be declared "plague-infected" and special inspections ordered. Furthermore, recently, passengers have had to</p>
<p>Prepare an Epidemic Prevention Certificate</p>
<p>The fact that passengers are not infected is also guaranteed. At present, the Japanese military's order, which will be implemented from August 1, is unlikely to find passengers infected with plague. It is believed that this is another step in obstructing foreign interests in China. Shipping companies expect that the arrival of ships at Dagu will be delayed by two to</p>
<p>Five Days</p>
<p>Which will disrupt the ship schedule greatly. There are many people who go to the northern ports to escape the summer heat this year. The delay of ships in Tianjin will disrupt the itinerary of the summer travelers, at least causing inconvenience, and it is quite possible to encounter difficulties.</p>
<h3>Temporary Difficulty in Achieving Navigation Between Shanghai and Wenzhou</h3>
<h3>Through Transport Between Shanghai and Kunming; Yong Port Prevents Smuggling</h3>
<p>The British company Yi Long, with its ship "Shenguang", planned to restore the Shanghai-Wenzhou route to facilitate passenger and cargo transport. On the 25th, it departed from Shanghai for Wenzhou, but was blocked outside the port due to the port's closure and was unable to enter. The company requested the authorities to allow the transshipment of passengers and cargo via barges, similar to the Shanghai-Ningbo route. According to a New News Agency reporter's inquiry with the company, the ship is still anchored outside Wenzhou port, awaiting instructions from the authorities. Meanwhile, sources in the shipping industry report that the authorities have disapproved the request due to defense concerns, as Japanese warships frequently harass Wenzhou with artillery fire, and defense cannot be relaxed. Therefore, the resumption of the Shanghai-Wenzhou route is temporarily difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>Through Transport Between Shanghai and Kunming</p>
<p>Shipping between Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Fujian was once completely interrupted, causing passengers and cargo bound for the interior to concentrate on the coast and detour through Kunming to reach the interior. To facilitate passenger and cargo transport, the shipping industry implemented through transport between Shanghai and Kunming via Saigon, Vietnam. Recently, the French postal ship "Felix Roussel" carried hundreds of tons of goods for this purpose, and Shanghai has received a telegram stating its safe arrival after only ten days. Passenger and cargo transport is now flourishing.</p>
<p>Cargo Transport at Yong Port</p>
<p>The Yong Garrison Headquarters issued a notice to all shipping companies and merchants, stating that the approved import goods have been specifically listed in existing regulations. Any goods not covered by these regulations are not allowed to be imported. Previous regulations dictated that the Zhejiang Provincial Government would make overall arrangements based on actual needs. Therefore, when merchants purchase goods, they must first inquire with the Ningbo Import and Export Cargo Inspection Office. If there are no regulations, they must submit a detailed list of the goods, including type, name, manufacturer, trademark, and quantity, directly to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for approval.</p>

<p>After the Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee began processing interbank transfers on July 4th, various currency exchange houses provided property as collateral to the committee for issuing and circulating funds. The committee decided to seriously handle the issuance of transfers based on the actual needs of each currency exchange house. The Currency Exchange Association members initially requested ten million yuan, with the association sending letters to each house to determine the amount. The houses subsequently reported their requests, including one house requesting 1.7 million yuan, one house requesting 1.4 million yuan, twenty-four houses requesting amounts ranging from 100,000 to 600,000 yuan, and fifteen houses requesting nothing, totaling twelve million yuan. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Currency Exchange Association held a regular meeting of the standing committee, attended by Ji Ming, Zhang Mengzhou, Xu Wenqing, and Lu Shuchen. They reported the requested amounts from each house. After review and approval, they will be forwarded to the Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee.</p>
<h3>Forced Registration for Livestock Market Sales Under Puppet Regime</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the puppet "Livestock Market" by the Japanese puppet organization, it has illegally monopolized the source and manipulated the operation of various livestock such as fresh pork, beef, lamb, chicken, and duck, causing opposition from various industries. The details have been reported previously. According to a Da Guang News Agency reporter's investigation, the puppet "Livestock Market" is forcibly occupying private land at the intersection of Zhaofeng Road and Wuhua Road in Hongkou to build a new puppet "market," which is nearing completion. The Japanese puppet authorities are driving ignorant people to solicit and entice merchants from various industries to participate. However, merchants from various industries, understanding the bigger picture, have decided to refuse cooperation, causing disappointment to the Japanese puppet authorities. Therefore, they have resorted to retaliatory measures, forcing "registration" of transport vessels. All livestock transported from the production area to Shanghai must be carried by transport vessels designated by the puppet "market," otherwise they will be detained. Currently, various industry associations for fresh pork, beef, lamb, chicken, and duck are discussing ways to respond to this illegal oppression.</p>
<h3>Safety Campaign Should Be Permanently Maintained</h3>
<p>According to a statement from the Public Concession Bureau of Works, after the Safety Campaign Promotion Week held in the city from June 18th to 24th, the occurrence of accidents has been significantly reduced. Therefore, the authorities will permanently maintain this campaign to reduce unfortunate incidents. Safety signs with the message "Pass Through Here" have been erected at intersections in busy areas such as Yu Qiaqing Road, Racecourse Road, Guangdong Road, and Beihai Road, and safe zones have been designated for pedestrians to cross the road.</p>
<h3>Passenger Ships Arrive in Shanghai One After Another</h3>
<p>The British Company's Far East route regular passenger ship "Kauff" came to Shanghai from Europe to Japan on the 9th of this month. It has now returned to Shanghai from Kobe and Yokohama, Japan, and is scheduled to arrive at the port at 1:30 PM today, berthing at buoys 12 and 13. It is reported that this ship's return to Shanghai from Japan is carrying 21 passengers. The ship is scheduled to leave on the 1st of next month at 3:00 PM to return to London. The US President Lines' "President Coolidge" arrived in Shanghai from the United States to Hong Kong and Manila on the 20th of this month. It was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai from Manila to return to the United States tomorrow (31st), but due to a typhoon that hit Shanghai when it went from Shanghai to Manila, the voyage was delayed by one day. Therefore, the return to Shanghai from Manila will also be delayed by one day, and it will not arrive in Shanghai until 2:30 PM on August 1st. It is scheduled to berth at buoys 11 and 12. The ship is scheduled to leave the next day (2nd) at 8:00 AM to return to the United States.</p>

<h3>Twenty British Missionaries Forced Out of Kaifeng After Threats; Anti-British Movement Erupts After Incitement; Japanese Army Openly Orders Missionaries to Leave Immediately; Only American Missionaries Not Hindered</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that yesterday (28th), news disclosed from this port that about twenty British missionaries were driven out of Kaifeng last week after the most intense intimidation and arrived in Qingdao. Their Chinese staff were also subjected to the same intimidation. Although the details of this matter are not yet fully known, people in this port believe that only the most appalling situation could drive these British people out of the city, because a year ago they were willing to endure the danger of being insulted during the Japanese occupation. Yesterday, Shanghai finally received</p>
<p>Confirmation of Withdrawal</p>
<p>It is said that the British in Kaifeng encountered a situation created by the Japanese-controlled puppet regime that resembled the early days of the Boxer Rebellion, and were forced to leave quickly. After several days of incitement, an anti-British sentiment erupted on July 7th, with angry mobs surrounding two British churches (China Inland Mission and Canadian Church). Both groups had many female staff members. The houses were surrounded by obstacles, and the supply of food and water was cut off. The spokesmen for the mobs ordered the missionaries to leave the city within 24 hours. It is said that the first attackers</p>
<p>Were Muslims</p>
<p>This is the most bizarre point. Those people told the Chinese staff of the church that if they were associated with the puppet groups, they would be given a reward of ten to twelve yuan per month, but the Chinese staff of the church immediately refused despite being deeply afraid of being retaliated against. The riots then continued to occur. The leaders of the two churches immediately went to the headquarters of the Japanese garrison to protest the fact that the Japanese army allowed the riots in the city without intervening. The garrison commander replied that he was very concerned and would investigate. The commander returned a moment later and said that the matter was very dangerous, and that they should leave the city as soon as possible, as "we cannot control your</p>
<p>Anti-British sentiment"</p>
<p>What happened afterwards is not yet known, but the missionaries immediately packed up and took the Longhai Railway train to Xuzhou, and then to Qingdao, which proves the serious nature of the riots. Schools, administrative offices, churches, and staff dormitories were all forced to be abandoned and left unguarded. Even the caretaker of the China Inland Mission church was forced to leave. The fate of this church property, worth hundreds of thousands of yuan, is uncertain. However, Dr. Hayes of the American Southern Baptist Church is expected to exert some influence on the puppet government to urge the puppet government or allow the American Church to protect these properties. The China Inland Mission Hospital</p>
<p>Is Large in Scale</p>
<p>It had about five foreign doctors and several foreign nurses, who were forced by the mobs to evacuate more than 100 patients within a few hours, some of whom had just left the operating room. Since the city was occupied, the refugees in the large refugee camps run by the two churches must have been in great distress, because after the final notice was given by the mobs, the refugees in these refugee camps and the schools within them had all been evacuated. It is said that none of the missionaries were physically harmed. They only took more valuable things with them when they left the city. Before leaving, the mobs told the missionaries that they would never be allowed to enter again. Kaifeng has been a center of church activities for more than 80 years. News that arrived in Shanghai yesterday also stated that before the British withdrew, a large number of American missionaries were not hindered.</p>
<h3>Jin Xuecheng Suddenly Arrested</h3>
<p>Jin Xuecheng, the former manager of the China-America Morning Post, a native of Peidong, was suddenly arrested by the Japanese and the Public Concession Police Department at around 8:00 PM the night before last (28th). The location of his arrest was his residence on the third floor of the Tongyi Trust Company at No. 384 Beijing Road and Henan Road. The reason for his arrest is unknown. One source said that he has been transferred to Hongkou.</p>
<h3>Chinese Employees of French Concession Water and Electricity Company Request Wage Increase</h3>
<h3>Work Stopped for Two Hours But Not a Strike</h3>
<p>The Chinese employees of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company, due to the currency devaluation and rising prices of everything, staged a demonstrative work stoppage on the 28th to demand an increase in subsidies from the authorities, causing a verbal dispute. But it was not a strike. After negotiations, they resumed normal work. It is said that the negotiations have not yet yielded results and are still in progress. The Chinese employees of the company have not received a raise since 1937, while the cost of living has gradually increased by more than 40%. Another source said that the work stoppage lasted for about two hours due to the demand for increased wages.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Accommodate Silk Factory Deposits</h3>
<h3>Shanghai's Environment Is Unique; The Situation Is Different Than Before</h3>
<p>The Silk Factory Association previously requested that import duties be paid in legal tender when cocoons are shipped to Shanghai. If withdrawals are made weekly, it would take too long, so they requested accommodation to remove the restrictions. After sending a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, they received a reply stating that the Ministry's decision to restrict deposits was originally intended to stabilize the financial situation and prevent the arbitrage of foreign exchange. The current environment in Shanghai is unique and different from the situation during the August 13th incident. Therefore, the request to be exempt from deposit restrictions cannot be granted.</p>
<h3>Several Cargo Ships Detained Near Huangdu</h3>
<p>At around 4:00 PM on the 28th, several small steam launches returning to Shanghai from the interior towing several civilian boats were attacked near Huangdu. Several cargo ships were detained. After inspection, the small steam launches were released. To avoid danger, westbound flights have been reduced or suspended. The routes to Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhujiajiao, etc., scheduled for the 29th, have all been temporarily postponed. Armed Japanese soldiers are now patrolling the river surface around Beixinjing in motorboats, inspecting ships.</p>
<h3>The Style of Pei Qing, A Prominent Figure in the Money Exchange Industry</h3>
<p>-- Yu Zhai</p>
<p>Mr. Pei Yunqing is a respected native of Songxia Town, Shangyu, Zhejiang. Anyone who has been to Songxia will nod and say "good" from the bottom of their hearts when they mention him. This is not accidental. If he did not care about his hometown and benefit his fellow villagers, he would not have such a reputation. It is a typical small medieval town, without the influence of foreign culture and very few modern decorations. The simple folk customs and honest habits have shaped Mr. Pei's current indifferent life. A gray cloth gown is his usual dress and his most solemn formal wear. Even now, he still uses a carriage. Whenever someone advises him to buy a car instead, he always smiles and shakes his head, saying: "Thank you, I always value practicality and don't pursue superficiality. I don't feel the need to ride in a car yet!" His frugality is evident here.</p>
<p>I remember that it was on the Dragon Boat Festival that I received an invitation from him. I went as scheduled and found that those invited were mostly people with more reputation. He solemnly invited us to be seated, but saw that the table was only set with five vegetarian dishes and five meat dishes. This could not help but surprise the guests, thinking that for such a grand banquet, the dishes would be so simple. Perhaps the home-cooked meals of a sophisticated family would be much more exquisite. But in the end, everyone was moved by his great personality and felt that this time, it was more flavorful than eating those delicacies.</p>
<p>He is already nearly sixty years old this year. Although his temples are gray, he still looks like a middle-aged person. I have never seen him show any signs of aging for even a minute. That is to say, no matter when and no matter what he is dealing with, he is always fully focused and has never shown any signs of distraction or depression. I once admired him and said, "Your spirit is really admirable. It can be said that you deserve the title of 'old and strong'." His reply was: "Old? It's really too early. Facts and responsibilities show us that we must not fail to summon up our spirits to engage in it. Spirit is the driving force of all work. In fact, as long as you grasp the interest in your career and understand the importance of responsibility, the spirit will naturally follow you."</p>
<p>He has been in Shanghai for forty-four years. He started out as a student in a money exchange shop. He was determined to only work hard and not ask for harvest. He struggled hard for decades and created his current position as one of the leading figures in the money exchange industry in this port. He often uses flexible diplomacy to cope with difficult external work. He treats people fairly and honestly, and he is not willing to relax his own moral character easily. Filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, etiquette, righteousness, and shame are the conditions for him to build his personality. And not gambling, especially not even smoking, is even more commendable. He uses his personality to influence his subordinates, never deceiving himself or others. His reasoning starts with old morality and ends with new morality, melting old and new morality into one furnace. In his simply decorated but very meaningful office, and even in his staff's office, you can find striking and alarming maxims and slogans. He also printed a small booklet of "Amulet Maxims" and distributed it to the public to save the declining social customs. His painstaking efforts can be imagined.</p>
<p>A meeting with a leader in the money exchange industry is often very busy. The day before yesterday, I wanted to visit him. I first gave him a call to ask him when it would be most convenient, and his answer was 7:00 AM every day. I really doubted it, suspecting that I had misheard, because in Shanghai, visiting a reputable friend at 7:00 AM is really rare. So, at 6:50 AM yesterday morning, I got into the car, but then thought that it might be too early. I temporarily changed direction and went to the west of Shanghai to take some fresh air. After circling around for a big lap, when I got to his office, the watch was pointing to 7:25 AM. Who knew that when I ran in, there were already three guests sitting in the room, and they were finishing their conversation. I couldn't help but say "ashamed" in my heart. Although it was not intentional, at least I had not been able to fully understand him.</p>
<p>Many documents were messily piled on the table. He told me that he had already handled a lot of official business at that time. He said: "Because my mind is clearer in the morning, I handle many things in the morning. At the same time, I also let Jiande learn how to handle things."</p>
<p>Mr. Jiande is Mr. Pei's eldest son. He is now working in the China Trust Company. He is diligent, thrifty, and simple, and he is very much like his father. He is deeply valued by his superiors. Before 9:00 AM every morning, he also helps his father with business. He is truly carrying on his father's legacy.</p>
<p>Mr. Pei is fond of lotus. Outside the office, there is a very exquisite flower garden, where various flowers are planted. In the center is a lotus tank, in which several lotus flowers stand upright, swaying in the wind, making his noble character even more prominent. The clear morning dew rolled around like silver beads. I imagined a section of snow lotus root lying across his roots, emerging from the mud without being stained, which is truly the most accurate symbol of Mr. Pei.</p>
<p>Mr. Pei is such a typical character: "His age is a laggard of the times, his career is catching up with the times, and his thoughts and actions are always standing in front of the times."</p>
<p>I have been neglecting ink for a long time. Because of the influence of Mr. Pei's cultivation, I have a deep impression, so I just wrote a little to introduce him to the readers.</p>

<h3>Export of Insured Registered Mail Prohibited from Containing Cash</h3>

<h3>Dispute Arises Over Buying and Selling Old Bricks and Iron Materials Under Artillery Fire; Wu Songhe and Bao Chengde Accused</h3>
<p>Xie Fuqing, a wealthy real estate businessman residing at No. 31 Qingyun Lane, Yuyuan Road (63 years old), hired lawyer Tang Youwei as his agent and filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against Wu Songhe, a local resident residing at No. 4 Huaan Lane, Xujiahui Road, and Bao Chengde, manager of Jianghai Bank on Ningbo Road (currently residing at No. 7 Yunshou Lane, Yuyuan Road), seeking</p>
<p>Repayment</p>
<p>of a debt of 3,760 yuan. It is claimed that the first defendant, Wu Songhe, purchased the remaining old bricks and iron materials from Yuqing Lane, Meiyuan Road, Jiqing Lane, and Juqing Lane on Hanzhong Road, Zhabei in October of last year, stating that the price would be 4,100 yuan and that all shipping matters would be handled by the buyer at his own expense and would not involve the plaintiff. At that time, in addition to paying a deposit of 300 yuan, the remaining 3,760 yuan would be paid in full after the permit was issued</p>
<p>Transport</p>
<p>After it was clear, it was guaranteed by the second defendant, Bao Chengde. After purchasing the old bricks and iron materials, the first defendant immediately sold them to Wanli Foreign Company at a high price, and the company obtained a permit. It had already been transported away in its entirety last winter. On the one hand, it falsely claimed to the plaintiff that the old materials had all been moved away by the Japanese military, so it was not liable for payment, etc. Afterwards, the plaintiff entrusted an agent lawyer to send a letter to the so-called "Zhabei Police Station" and the "Social Affairs Bureau" for</p>
<p>Investigation</p>
<p>After the investigation, it was found that it was indeed transported by Wanli Foreign Company. Under such circumstances, it is clear that the defendants are undoubtedly trying to deny the debt. After receiving the complaint, the court ordered Judge Wu Xiaoke to come to the Civil Division to summon the parties yesterday. Both parties were represented by agent lawyers. The plaintiff's agent lawyer stated the process as above. The court immediately ordered the debate to begin and then stated that the case was clear and set a date for sentencing on August 3.</p>

On the 17th of this month, Wang escaped at the opportunity and reported it to the police, who arrested Gu Xiaomei and sent her to the First Special Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng took the case to the Third Criminal Court for sentencing. Gu Xiaomei was sentenced to three years of fixed-term imprisonment for kidnapping a young girl with the intention of making a profit and forcing her into prostitution.</p>
<h3>Woman Abuses Adopted Daughter; Forcing Her into Prostitution and Beating and Burning Her; Escapes the Trap; Woman Arrested Awaiting Investigation</h3>
<p>Yu Xinnian, a girl from Suzhou, is 15 years old this year. In February of this year, her stepfather sent her to Zhou Yuan, a woman from Suzhou at No. 73, Hongfu Lane 66, Xinzha Road, as an adopted daughter. However, she was violent in nature and often abused her, and also burned her with a hot copper brazier, causing her to be unbearable. She secretly escaped on the night of the 17th of this month, wandering on the road for three days and nights. On the night of the 20th at about 9:00 PM, Yu was discovered by detectives from the French Concession Police on Xujiahui Road, taken to the police station, and interrogated. It was then transferred to the Xinzha Police Station, which sent detective Deng Hailin to arrest Zhou Yuan and detain her at the police station. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a lawsuit under Article 286 of the Criminal Law for the crime of abuse. According to Yu X</p>
<h3>Arrest of Tailor for Murdering Wife: Cai Wang's Right Hand Severed, Cai Jingen Detained for Investigation and Trial</h3>
<p>Cai Jingen, a local resident and tailor residing at No. 1 Triangle Land, Xujiahui Road, married a woman surnamed Zhu from his hometown three years ago through a matchmaker. Initially, the couple's relationship was harmonious, but later, disagreements arose frequently, leading to</p>
<p>constant quarrels.</p>
<p>Last November, Cai Wang left in anger and became a servant in the home of a Westerner in western Shanghai. Unexpectedly, Cai recently discovered that his wife's conduct was improper and that she was having an affair with a ticket seller. Therefore, on the night of the 5th of this month, around 7 pm, he secretly hid a kitchen knife and ambushed her with accomplices at the intersection of Great West Road and Columbia Road in western Shanghai. As soon as Cai Wang arrived, they stopped her,</p>
<p>pulled out the knife,</p>
<p>and hacked at her. At that time, her right hand was severed by the knife, and she sustained a total of twenty-one knife wounds on her head and back. Overwhelmed with pain, she collapsed to the ground, and blood gushed out like a spring. Subsequently, Chinese detective Yao Changmin of the Jing'an Temple Police Station arrived after receiving a report, arrested Cai Jingen, and took him and the knife to the police station. He also transported Cai Wang to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the police transferred Cai to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The victim, Cai Wang, also</p>
<p>arrived in court injured.</p>
<p>Her right hand had been completely severed, and her head and face were wrapped in gauze. She sat and was interrogated. She stated that her husband did not engage in honest work but instead indulged in idleness. She was forced to go out and work as a servant. The defendant also came to demand money from time to time, and if he was not satisfied, he would beat her. She realized his intention was to kill her and requested an investigation. When questioned, Cai Jingen confessed that his wife had an affair with a ticket seller, so he injured her. Judge Fu instructed that the defendant be detained for a rescheduled hearing on the 8th of next month.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: Eagerness to Settle Forward Foreign Exchange, Swap Points Squeezed Accordingly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the HSBC listing. In the informal market, the British and American exchange rates were buoyed by news that the international situation was more favorable to China and that a large loan agreement had been reached between China and Russia. This news cleared the gloom that had hung over the foreign exchange market for the past two weeks and greatly stabilized sentiment. Speculators were unable to use their usual tactics. At the opening, foreign firms were reluctant to sell, but the market was supported by strong selling interest from outsiders. Subsequently, the Bombay Silver Company, Western merchant Sassoon, and Chinese speculators all competed to sell. The eagerness to settle August contracts was especially strong, so August prices were lower than spot prices. Swap points were squeezed accordingly. Based on the midday closing bank selling rates, the British gold point difference was 375 and the US dollar point difference was 75, equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commissions) of about 9.4%. However, arbitrageurs only earned 7.78%, leading to a sharp decline in arbitrage transactions. Most of the half-day's trading involved futures.</p>
<p>Spot and Forward Loosen in Tandem</p>
<p>In the morning, London silver futures were up 1.875 on the near-term contract and up 1.25 on the far-term contract. New York silver prices were stable, and London gold remained flat. Exchange rates saw the pound rise slightly against the dollar by three points, fall against Shanghai by 25 points, and remain unchanged against the franc. The dollar was unchanged against the pound, up 2.5 points against Shanghai, and up 0.0625 against the franc. The central bank's listed rates for all currencies remained the same. At the opening, banks quoted spot selling rates of 4.34375 for British gold and 8.4375 for the US dollar, up 0.03125 and 0.0625 respectively from the previous close. After the opening, Japanese and foreign firms successively sought to settle, but the market was stable because outsiders were willing to sell. Japanese Zhenjin first settled spot British gold at 4.375, followed by foreign firms purchasing spot British gold from HSBC and other foreign banks at 4.34375 and spot US dollars at 8.4375 from an American bank. When the HSBC listing was announced, there were no changes. After the announcement of the silver equalization tax, the exemption remained unchanged. Afterwards, Japanese Zhenjin and others suddenly wanted to sell. The August British gold price rose from 3.8125 to 3.875, but outsiders were unwilling to buy, resulting in difficulty in finding trades. The Bombay Silver Company, Western merchant Sassoon, and Chinese speculators all competed to sell. August British gold was sold to the British Bank and China-Belgium Bank at prices ranging from 3.9375 to 4.0625. August US dollars were sold to Datong and Yun Tong at prices ranging from 7.75 to 8. At the same time, spot British gold was sold back to the British Bank at 4.375 and 4.0625, and spot US dollars were resold to a certain bank at 8.5625, causing spot prices to loosen. By noon, outsiders' selling interest was also strong, but trading was quiet. By the midday close, banks quoted spot selling rates of 4.4375 for British gold and 8.625 for the US dollar, and August British gold at 4.0625 and US dollars at 7.875. As a result, spot British gold was down 0.125 and the US dollar was down 0.25 from the previous day, with even greater loosening in the August contracts. There was no afternoon session due to Saturday.</p>
<h3>Scattered Selling Continues to Emerge, Gold Prices Plunge, Daily Fluctuations Narrow, Volume Approximately 700 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold informal market was slightly mediocre, with a volatile and unpredictable trend. Sentiment was generally weak, due to the prevailing political situation. The U.S. abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and the U.K.'s supportive statements were perceived as turning the tide in China's favor. General operators expected a possible breakdown in Anglo-Japanese negotiations. Scattered retail investors continued to unload holdings. The morning opening traded as low as $3,620. Subsequently, securities firms took advantage of the low prices to buy, and a certain gold shop also purchased on behalf of speculators. The market briefly rebounded to $3,670. However, the foreign exchange spot market tightened, the securities firms ceased purchases and began to square positions. Prices once again turned downwards, dropping to the day's low of $3,595 by the midday close. This represented a further fall of $100. There was no official market in the afternoon, but reports suggested that underlying sentiment had strengthened, with prices rebounding to $3,620. Morning trading saw numerous small transactions and few large block trades, with a total volume of approximately 700 taels. Gold jewelry fell $10. Shanghai Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Drops Another $100</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened at $3,620, reflecting the momentum of the previous day. A money exchange shop sold ten taels to a gold shop at $3,620. Subsequently, securities firms and a certain Yu shop (acting for speculators) stepped in to buy. Although a certain silver building sold on behalf of wealthy bulls, the demand still outweighed the supply, and the market rose, gaining $50. A certain gold shop bought 50 taels from a money exchange shop and 10 taels from a silver building at $3,670, the day's high. News that the foreign exchange spot market had strengthened caused sentiment to waver, and buyers turned cautious. A money exchange shop forcefully sold dozens of taels. The price soon dropped $30. A money exchange shop sold 40 taels to a securities firm at $3,640. The securities firm also suddenly turned bearish, weakening underlying sentiment, and the price broke through the $3,600 level. The securities firm sold 50 taels to a money exchange shop at $3,590. Afterwards, a certain gold shop bought more than 100 taels on behalf of a speculator, and the scarcity of sellers caused prices to rise sharply by $65. A certain gold shop bought 20 taels from a money exchange shop at $3,660. At 11:30, news that the foreign exchange market had strengthened triggered selling, and the market weakened again. By the midday close, a silver building sold 20 taels to a money exchange shop at $3,595, the midday closing price. Reports indicated that underlying sentiment remained stable after the close, with trades reported at $3,600. The afternoon session was suspended due to the foreign exchange market being closed on Saturday. Based on the midday closing price of $3,595, the price fell $100 from the previous session, with a fluctuation range of $75 for the half-day. The cash gold shops' listed selling price was $10 higher than the informal market price, and the current standard gold price was approximately $50 lower than the listed gold price. According to inquiries, trading was extremely quiet.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Listing Down a Little Ten Dollars</p>
<p>The initial exchange price for jewelry gold per tael at major silver buildings remained at $375. At 9:48 AM, it was lowered by $5, and at 11:50 AM, it was lowered again by $5. There were no further changes. The major silver buildings' listed price was $365, and the new silver buildings' listed price was $363. The buy-in price was reduced by approximately $10 to $20.</p>
<p>Sino-British Pure Gold Unchanged</p>
<p>A London dispatch on the 28th stated that the price of pure British gold remained at £7 8s 6.5d per ounce, and the Central Bank's purchase price for Chinese cash remained at $1,212.6. The listed Shanghai Customs gold remained flat at $2.396. The Shanghai Standard Gold price also remained unchanged at $1,210.9.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Fall Again, U.S. and British Currencies Fall Three Dollars</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies weakened as the foreign exchange market continued to loosen and the cash gold market fell sharply. The supply of U.S. and British currencies increased, and the market loosened. The selling of gold notes was very smooth, and demand decreased. Hong Kong and French notes fell sharply. Few buyers were seen collecting them in the market. Japanese gold notes were not dared to be collected. The market price fell by about 4 cents to $1.07 in the evening session. There was little supply and demand for Korean notes, which remained at 89 cents. In the public association trading, Qin Tai sold 2,000 French notes to Tong Feng, and 150 yuan of Roby notes. Yong Feng sold 300 yuan of Annam notes to Fu He Xiang. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds decreased by $1.50, gold notes decreased by $1.40, U.S. gold pounds decreased by $3, gold notes decreased by 25 cents, Hong Kong notes decreased by 5 cents, French francs decreased by 3 li, Singapore notes decreased by 10 cents, Dutch and Annam notes each decreased by 5 cents, Canadian notes decreased by 50 cents, Philippine notes decreased by 30 cents, and Australian gold notes decreased by $1.80. Only a few remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Rises Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange rose slightly. The price per thousand yuan fluctuated around $255 in the morning and rose to $260 in the afternoon, but soon fell back to $257.5, an increase of $2.5 from the previous day. The Shanghai Money Industry Association's interbank lending rate remained unchanged at 20 cents in both the morning and afternoon sessions.</p>
<h3>Indian Silver Also Rises</h3>
<p>A London dispatch on the 28th stated that Indian and speculative short covering, with little supply, stabilized the market. After the close, India inquired about prices at 0.0625 higher than the listed price, but there were very few transactions. Large silver bars were up 1.875 on the near-term contract and up 1.25 on the far-term contract. A New York silver dispatch stated that the U.S. spot price remained stable. A Bombay silver dispatch stated that the Indian silver market was firm, with the spot price up 6 annas and both futures contracts up 9 annas. A total of 200 contracts were traded.</p>
<h3>Securities: Internal Debt Turns Around</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities informal market continued to be good, and market sentiment has improved. The gloom of the past month has gradually dissipated. After the United States announced the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and took further measures, there were also rumors of large loans from the Soviet Union to China. It can be seen that there are still people willing to help in times of need. This situation was a blow to Japan psychologically, and it was like a refreshing remedy for China, greatly boosting morale. The market's sluggish sentiment was immediately excited, and buying interest was strong. However, large investors were still selling, so the increase was limited. However, the price increased by another dollar in the informal market, and the situation has improved. Principal and interest are no longer a problem, and there is a glimmer of hope. Yesterday, Dafeng, Lianyi, and No. 38 were actively bought at the opening, but No. 20 and No. 64 still had a large supply, so the rise was firm but not sharp. Later, Defu and Zhenkang were still willing to buy, while Tongyu Datong continued to sell, so the result was only slightly better by 4 to 8 cents. After the close, gold firms had a need, so the informal market could rise by about one yuan. The total number of transactions was about 780,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>There were no stock transactions yesterday. The report of the public stock exchange stated that yesterday morning was the beginning of the new week's trading. Market atmosphere was good, and prices were generally high. The foreign exchange market was slightly stable because the difference between the spot price and the August price was smaller. The good market atmosphere was also due to this reason. If short-term foreign exchange arbitrage continues to be huge, a large amount of currency will be invested in the foreign market, which will negatively affect investors.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Mixed Ups and Downs</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, according to London telecommunications, had slight ups and downs. August rose 0.75 to 7 shillings 0.75, December was 6 shillings 2.5 pence, and March of next year was 6 shillings 2.75 pence, all up by a small halfpenny. The public association's quoted price for 24 coarse white spot was a small triangle. The price at the local warehouse was 34 yuan, the price at the foreign warehouse was 33 yuan 80 cents, and the price for re-export goods was a small 25 cents at 25 yuan 65 cents. Taikoo truck white also rose 2,3,4 cents. B mark East warehouse 38 yuan 20 cents, West warehouse 38 yuan 50 cents, BC mark 38 yuan 20 cents, CX mark 37 yuan 80 cents, DY mark 37 yuan 40 cents, HHX mark 37 yuan 20 cents. The spot price of Dutch red sugar rose 40 cents to 29 yuan 20 cents, and the re-export price rose 10 cents to 22 yuan 30 cents. Local refined white sugar rose by a small half yuan. Zhenji No. 1 was 33 yuan 50 cents, No. 2 was 33 yuan, No. 3 was 32 yuan 50 cents, and No. 4 was 31 yuan. Chao Bang opened a hundred or so bags of domestic sugar red sugar, rising to 31 yuan. 275 bags of newly arrived oil-packaged Hainan red sugar were 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Hong Kong and Yunnan Sell Well, Unpopular Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market first fell and then rebounded, but generally remained in a state of fluctuation. Although the volume of cotton yarn transactions was not large, most of the transactions were actual transactions, so sentiment was stable. In addition, inland merchants who mainly purchased Japanese yarn have recently found that the price of unpopular Chinese yarn is cheaper. Merchants' calculations prioritize profit. Therefore, unpopular yarn has a glimmer of hope. Some say that the concept of using domestic products is deeply ingrained in the areas of southern China, Hong Kong, and Yunnan. New factories are promoting Chinese yarn in these areas because the price is 70-80 yuan to 100 yuan cheaper. Why should they specialize in one or two brands of yarn and be manipulated without giving up?</p>
<p>The current yarn situation: The market opened in the morning with general terror rumors being self-defeating and sentiment being very calm. In addition, the heat of various speculative tools has decreased uniformly, and the commercial market has moved towards a peaceful path. Speculative transactions have decreased. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn at the foreign warehouse was 555 yuan, and the warehouse order price was 544 yuan, falling by 2-3 yuan. Before long, news that the foreign exchange market had strengthened caused selling to increase slightly, falling another 3-4 yuan. The 20-count Double Horse yarn price at the foreign warehouse fell to 550 yuan, and the warehouse order price fell to 541 yuan. By the close, news that inland merchants had some need for the local yarn caused sentiment to rise, and prices rebounded a few yuan. According to statistics, 765 packages were traded in the half-day. The market was relatively stable. Yong'an Factory opened 120 packages of 10-count Special Jincheng yarn at a price of 640 yuan. These were purchased by Hong Kong merchants. It was found that 1,690 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong today (the 30th), and 350 pieces were transported to Beihai, 90 pieces were transported to Haikou, 20 pieces were transported to Guangzhou Bay, and 750 pieces were transported to Haiphong. The amounts purchased by each group are listed below.</p>
<p>Hong Kong 220 Inland 200</p>
<p>Same Industry 315 Xiamen 10</p>
<p>Statistics 765 Previous Day's Transactions 66</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market was peaceful because the short squeeze for this month was over. There was some demand in the north, but foreign firms were very picky about the few packages of one or two popular cotton yarns they took in. The spot price of 20-count Yueqin was 430 yuan.</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Arrives Daily, Foreign Firms Sell at Low Prices, Payment in One Month</h3>
<p>The domestic cotton business has become quiet. Only Meiyin Cotton's Japanese Daikang factory has a slight need, purchasing 500 pieces. This batch of goods is all sold to the spot market by fellow traders. Huashang Rongfeng Factory imported 300 pieces of 10-count coarse yarn raw material Pingguoer. Because the discount on the French currency is high and credit is tight, they had to switch to purchasing at the exchange rate price. Therefore, today's transactions are less than in the previous two days, which is due to the financial contraction. The future of the cotton market is also in a state of uncertainty. The source of Su North cotton has withered again. Only 18 bales of Tonghua arrived at the pier. The current cotton situation is as follows.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market was more active in the morning. The Liverpool and Bombay telecommunications reported high increases, and there were many transactions among the industry. It is generally expected that in the near future, Japan may purchase US cotton due to the US cotton subsidy. However, prices fell slightly due to the large number of bank and foreign sellers. As a result, the closing price fell 7-8 pounds compared to the previous day. Indian prices, including forecasts, increased by more than 1 rupee, and Egyptian prices increased by more than 10 pounds.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton trading: With the exception of a small amount of the current Japanese factories' small inventory and the bargain price purchase of 1-2,000 pieces of Indian cotton, the payment terms are unusually preferential and payment is due at the end of August. Many Japanese cotton shipments arrived. Yesterday, another 3,000 pieces of Indian cotton were shipped. A large number of cotton shipments are expected to arrive at the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>Indian cotton continues to arrive. The British company's cargo ship Nagpore shipped 3,091 tons of cotton from Bombay. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. According to the company, the ship arrived yesterday morning and docked at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong to unload. It is said that another ship is also shipping cotton from Bombay to Shanghai. The quantity is slightly more than the amount imported yesterday. It is expected to arrive on the 4th of next month.</p>
<h3>Grains: Abundant Harvest in Dongxin, Coming to Market Soon, Wuhu Lifting Restrictions</h3>
<p>Domestic Rice: New early rice from Pudong has been sampled on the market, but the goods have not yet arrived. The quantity is only 25 stone. As for the quality, it is excellent. According to the owner, the new Dongxin rice is being launched on the market earlier this year, half a month earlier than last year. Because the year is abundant with favorable weather conditions, there is an 80% harvest. It can be transported to Shanghai in a steady stream later. At a time when rice prices are chaotic, this is good news that can comfort people. Yesterday's sources from all directions were still scarce. Over 1,000 bags of passenger wheel packaged rice arrived, but there were still no samples on the market. Only 16 yuan of the filming of the rice and 2,450 bags of 22 yuan's altered rice were carried out.</p>
<p>Passenger Xiang Rice: Yesterday, neither inland nor industry-owned warehouses made inquiries. Only 2,000 bags or so were from various households on the street. The Wuhu opening ban has been decided to be implemented. It is rumored that the fee is increased by 20 cents, and transfer certificates from Hangzhou, Suzhou, and other places are issued. Only Shanghai has not been approved yet. But since the inland area has been cleared, the Shanghai stock will not be transferred to the inland area, and the inland's high-end high-quality new rice can also be transferred to Shanghai. Therefore, sentiment has been falling and the passenger warehouses are competing to sell. The general market's machine made new rice is sold at a limited price of 16 yuan, and the final new rice is 15 yuan 60-70 cents. The damaged new rice is 15 yuan 30-40 cents to 15 yuan or so, which is a difference of 4-5,7,8 cents from the previous market. The price dropped by 4-5 cents. Foreign rice is deemed expensive because the passenger xiang rice has fallen sharply, and importers no longer make inquiries.</p>
<h3>Flour Factory Market: Reached 5 Yuan Cash, Sharp Increase of 15 Cents</h3>
<p>The current flour market is experiencing a strong price increase. The market price for No. 2 flour has reached 5 yuan in cash, an increase of 15 cents compared to the foreign exchange. It is reported that the price of returned goods has also increased to 4 yuan 90 cents in cash, a difference of 10 cents from the factory price. However, the market for returned goods is exhausted, and there is no available goods to purchase. Yesterday's trading by local buyers was still active, but large groups were still lacking. Currently, the production of each flour factory has decreased and they are unwilling to supply as much as possible. A total of 30,000 bags were traded in the general market, all of which were purchased in small quantities by local buyers. According to industry insiders, flour prices are still cheap in the context of rising prices of everything else. Therefore, the factory market price has reached 5 yuan, which may be temporarily fixed.</p>
<p>Wheat market: There was little arrival and sales, and the market still felt strong. Because the arrivals have all been stacked in the warehouses to wait for an opportunity, and the flour market increased by 15 cents yesterday, wheat, as the raw material for flour, should of course also increase. However, the factory appetite is still weak. Although there were inquiries from local warehouses, they still had intentions to choose the goods selectively. Therefore, the market could not be too good. A total of 1,100 bags or so of Kunshan, Puzhen, Wuyi, Nanjing, and other wheats were sold at a price of 6 yuan 73 cents to 48 cents, which was 2-3 cents higher than before. These were still purchased by the warehouse side.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes　Soybean Oil Plunges Sharply　Abrupt Drop of Four to Five Yuan from Highest Price　Soybean Cake Hoarders Release Stock, Price Also Drops</h3>
<p>Soybean Oil　The market was excessively excited, but due to sluggish actual sales, prices were difficult to maintain and suddenly plummeted. Yesterday's market price dropped abruptly by four to five yuan compared to the highest price on the 25th of this month. A total of 20 barrels of Dalian barrel oil were traded at a price of 47 yuan, and 30 barrels of Kobe oil from Dalian were traded at a price of 46.5 yuan. It was found that 150 pieces of soybean oil were shipped from Qingdao yesterday, plus 500 cans, and 300 cans of raw oil also arrived. Today, 335 cans of oil are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Soybean Cake　Due to the gradual decline in sales, major hoarders are eager to release their stocks, resulting in ample selling pressure. Prices have fallen through the three-yuan mark. A total of 3,000 pieces of Dalian Yuanji cake were traded, with prices falling from 2.93 yuan to 2.84 yuan. 2,000 pieces of miscellaneous brand cakes were traded at prices ranging from 2.85 yuan to 2.82 yuan, and 1,000 pieces of Yantai cake were traded at 2.83 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods　Blue Cloth Sales are Most Active　Bidding Prices Rise More Than Fall</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Recently, various merchant guilds, aware of the firm and high prices of goods, are all purchasing quickly. As a result, the trade in cloth from near and far has developed. Blue cloth is in the highest demand, with bidding prices rising by three to five jiao. 16-pound coarse white cloth rose by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan. Prices of other goods also rose in unison. The Shandong guild continued to purchase over 100 bales of Dasheng Yihua 16-pound coarse cloth. The Subei Ju Ning guild purchased over 2,000 bolts of blue cloth and other goods. The Yunnan guild purchased over 2,500 bolts of colored cloth, printed crepe, colored satin, fine twill, and bleached cloth. The Nanhua, Hangqian, Taikoo, and Yihua shipping companies will revise their regulations for water freight starting at the end of July, with all payments to be made in Hong Kong dollars, an increase of about 30% compared to the old regulations. Therefore, all goods that have been booked are being rushed for shipment. The Guangdong guild newly added over 3,000 bolts of woolen cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, and corduroy. The Nanyang guild purchased over 2,000 bolts of plain colored muslin, printed cambric, blue cloth, and bleached cloth. Wholesale firms on this street are adding over 100 pieces of white cloth, coarse cloth, colored cloth, etc., due to increased orders from customers in Hangzhou and Changzhou.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday's market for fine white cloth and fine twill was quiet, with stable bidding prices. Spot prices for Dragon Head fine cloth were 15.3 yuan. No forward contracts were opened by brokers. Over 300 bales of spot and forward goods were traded on this street, and the market was calm.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>Today, 1,140 pieces of cloth were shipped to Haiphong, 45 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 15 pieces to Beihai, and 170 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>French Western Shirting Suddenly Rises</h3>
<p>Woolen fabrics remained firm and increased yesterday. French Western shirting also rebounded. Yesterday, English-made Love 277 brand, wholesale price rose to 1.2 yuan per yard net. Domestic Hongsheng brand was 0.7 yuan, and Huaxing Iron Pagoda was 0.6 yuan. Other miscellaneous brands made entirely of wax yarn were sold for 0.54 yuan.</p>
<h3>Metals　Prices for White Lead Sheets Already High</h3>
<p>The trading of white lead sheets reached two to three hundred barrels yesterday. It was found that the destination was local battery factories and printing houses. In addition, tea warehouses, cigarette factories, and toy factories also purchased a small amount. Overseas orders were not many, and local inventory was low, so holders are considering hoarding. The asking price has risen by about 100 yuan compared to the previous price. Currently, No. 2 is sold for 460 yuan per barrel, No. 3 for 450 yuan, No. 4 for 440 yuan, No. 5 for 430 yuan, No. 6 for 420 yuan, No. 7 and No. 8 are both priced at 400 yuan, and No. 9 and No. 10 are priced at around 440 yuan. Other thick patterned ones require 450 to 500 yuan, and prices vary. Purchases are also rarer than thin patterned ones.</p>
<h3>Seafood　Ningzi Light Offerings are Fresh</h3>
<p>Ningzi light offerings have long been sold out and the market has been quiet for a long time. The first batch of new goods only arrived recently and was immediately sold at 125 yuan. Mingda large size three-four and Yuan Dan will have to wait until autumn to be available, and there is currently no market.</p>
<h3>Insect Goods are Scarce and the Market is Firm</h3>
<p>Due to the scarcity of insect goods recently, the market feels quite short, but the demand is not declining, and the trend is firm. Currently, Ningbo insects are sold for 30 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan compared to the previous price, and large ones are 35 yuan. Inventory is even scarcer and very popular.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods　Source of Sichuan Pickled Mustard Greens Blocked Again　Price Gradually Increases</h3>
<p>Sichuan pickled mustard greens could previously come directly from Hankou and fell to 43-44 yuan. However, this route has recently been blocked again, and the price has gradually increased. Currently, Leqi mustard greens are selling for 70 yuan, and Peiling mustard greens are 60 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal　Bituminous Coal is Firm</h3>
<p>Actual sales of bituminous coal are stagnant, with only local factories making slight purchases. However, sellers are quite firm and unwilling to sell easily, so asking prices are very high. Yesterday, a certain foreign firm traded several hundred tons of lump coal for cash, with Hokkaido coal priced at 58 yuan per ton, and regular coal at 52 yuan, ex-warehouse. Labor for barge loading and unloading is extra.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials　Sales of Foreign Camphor Revive</h3>
<p>Sales of foreign camphor were previously slow, but recently, due to sudden changes in foreign exchange rates, costs have increased dramatically. Therefore, those in the city with inventory are taking the opportunity to sell. Yesterday, a merchant guild bought a batch at a price of 320 yuan, and now it has risen again, with asking prices of 350-360 yuan, and the market is quite active.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Guilds Actively Purchase Bitter Almonds</h3>
<p>The season for new bitter almonds has arrived, but no goods have arrived in Shanghai yet. It was found that the old goods stored here have also been sold successively. Previous prices for high-grade goods reached 60 yuan. Recently, Hong Kong guilds have been in high demand, but due to the lack of goods in the market, only a small batch was traded at a price of 62 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan.</p>

<h3>A True Man Should Not Be a Sinner in Love</h3>
<p>A true man should stand tall and upright, never letting down others or himself. Standing in his position in the times, he can advance or retreat, be flexible and adaptable. Such a husband is a capable member of society and the nation, and the most ideal partner for modern women. Because he has abundant energy and a sharp mind, he will surely surpass others in studying and be more successful in his work. When it comes to love, he will be even more passionate and joyful, leading to incomparable happiness. Giving birth to smart and clever sons and daughters can further achieve the goal of eugenics. This is so glorious and meaningful! However, there is also a type of husband who, despite being a dignified man, is rejected by his wife and becomes a sinner in love. What is the reason for this? According to medical analysis, it must be due to early indulgence in masturbation and nocturnal emissions, or early marriage and excessive sexual indulgence, which consumes too much of the reproductive gland fluid. As a result, symptoms such as premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, scattered energy, neurasthenia, and infertile sperm will follow one after another. Such a husband will inevitably look withered and age prematurely. Not only in his livelihood or in the struggle to protect his family will he be in a miserable position. Wives are mostly competitive. When she sees that her husband is so useless, how can she not resent him in her heart? As for married life, if the husband shows weakness and incompetence, or even complete impotence, how heartbroken and distraught will she be! This may lead to domineering behavior, seeking a way out by eloping with others, or righteously suing her husband for divorce, which is commonplace in today's society!</p>
<p>Why should a true man be abandoned by women and become a sinner in love? In today's era of advanced medicine, even if one unfortunately suffers from the above symptoms, seeking treatment is not difficult. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductin" is the most effective treatment. This preparation is based on the principle of reproductive gland endocrine supplementation therapy, extracted from the reproductive glands of strong animals such as gorillas, sea dogs, bears, and deer, and reproduced using scientific methods. Therefore, it is of precious quality and great efficacy, surpassing any other endocrine preparation. After taking it, it can generate sperm and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves within one day and night. Continuing to take it for half a month can further promote development and regulate metabolism, and all the above symptoms can be completely cured. However, those with nocturnal emissions must also take "Himi-Toth Spermatocidal Pills" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage, so that both the symptoms and the root cause can be treated, and the effect will be rapid!</p>
<p>Patient Chen Zhongbai, 26 years old, from Anhui Province, works in agriculture. Last year, he came to Shanghai to escape the war and suffered from severe premature ejaculation and impotence, as well as nocturnal emissions. His wife, Ms. Li, was very dissatisfied and intended to file for divorce. I carefully diagnosed and treated him, and prescribed a large amount of "Reproductin" and "Himi-Toth Spermatocidal Pills" to be taken together. As a result, the nocturnal emissions stopped after one week. In less than a month, he completely regained his perfect health. As a result, the love between the couple deepened, and the past unpleasantness was swept away.</p>
<p>Beauty and Health</p>
<h3>Scientific Remedies for Sagging Breasts</h3>
<p>— American MD Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>Buying cosmetics for beauty,</p>
<p>Is the most foolish waste!</p>
<p>Know that modern women,</p>
<p>Need plump breasts and hips to be dazzling.</p>
<p>If a woman spares no effort to buy cosmetics to decorate herself in order to win praise from people, then that is the most foolish and wasteful thing. Know that in today's society, anyone with a little medical knowledge and a modern perspective knows that whether a woman is beautiful or not is entirely determined by whether her body is healthy. In other words, whether she has high and firm breasts, plump hips, and moist and firm muscles. If these three cannot meet the standards and are sagging, thin, and withered, then even if you pour dozens of yuan of expensive perfume and powder on your body, it will not be enough for modern men to even glance at. If you encounter frugal and outspoken men, they may even sarcastically mock you as a female parasite who only knows how to consume and not produce! In this case, if you are a married woman, your husband will naturally only hate you and not be happy! If you are an unmarried girl, who would dare to marry you, a wife who has lost her health and beauty and is not worth taking? Therefore, the future and fate of such women are unimaginably tragic! To seek rescue, one can only rely on science. According to the years of experimental reports from world-renowned gynecologist Kang Tuoxiu and French beauty master Tang Posheng, it is unanimously recognized that taking the ovary preparation for women</p>
<p>"Reproductin" is the most effective treatment. The main reason for sagging breasts and thin hips is that the function of the reproductive gland ovary is destroyed by masturbation, chest binding, irregular menstruation, and leucorrhea, which affects the metabolism. Therefore, if you take female "Reproductin" made from the secretion of the ovaries of male animals at this time, it can nourish the ovarian function, promote metabolism, and regulate menstruation within one day and night after taking it. Continuing to take it will not only make sagging breasts tall and firm, but also make hips plump, muscles smooth, and cheeks rosy, transforming ugliness into beauty.</p>
<h3>Physiological and Pathological Differentiation of Nocturnal Emissions</h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Many young people experience occasional physiological ejaculation and develop severe psychological terror, leading to insomnia and palpitations, which is too unfair! Know that there is a difference between physiological and pathological nocturnal emissions: A healthy young man who is physiologically mature and unmarried, or married and separated from his beloved wife, may experience one or two nocturnal emissions within one or two months due to the excessive abundance of seminal fluid produced physiologically. If there is no feeling of fatigue or dizziness after the emission, then this must be a physiological overflow and does not harm health at all, so there is no need to worry! If a young man with a history of masturbation or early marriage and sexual indulgence has damaged his sexual nerves and loosened his sperm gate, resulting in two or three or more emissions per month, and feels tired and brain-swollen after the emission, then this must be pathological nocturnal emission. As for those who have prolonged nocturnal emissions, or congenital weakness, post-illness imbalance, or excessive worry, and may even have a small amount of semen leaking out during the day, this is the most dangerous sperm leakage.</p>
<p>Pathological nocturnal emissions and sperm leakage must not be tolerated. Treating it early can save vitality, but if the leakage is prolonged until the essence is exhausted, then hundreds of diseases will arise, the most common being brain decay, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, impotence, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and so on. Such young people will not be able to continue their studies at school or perform their duties happily at work, so their future is bleak! At the same time, they will be dissatisfied with their wives in their married life, and all kinds of tragedies will occur in the family as a result, so their lifelong happiness will be lost! However, in today's era of advanced medicine, treating nocturnal emissions is not difficult. The most effective treatment is to take "Himi-Toth Spermatocidal Pills," which can consolidate the sperm gate and calm the nerves, and nocturnal emissions can be stopped immediately that night. If you already have the above symptoms, you must also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductin" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continuing to take it for half a month will surely cure all the symptoms. If the patient can come to this clinic for electrotherapy and injections, then a cure can be guaranteed.</p>

<h3>Why is Acute Leukorrhea Easy to Treat?</h3>
<p>Why is acute leukorrhea easy to cure? This question is not difficult to answer. It is because, in acute gonorrhea, the gonococci gather in the anterior urethra and have not yet spread internally, so effective treatment can wipe them out in one fell swoop, without causing hundreds of symptoms due to entering the posterior urethra. Once the gonococci enter the deep part and hundreds of symptoms occur, dealing with the gonococci becomes very difficult, requiring a longer period of treatment and a relatively large amount of money. It also requires experienced and responsible doctors to achieve the goal of a complete cure. If the treatment is not effective, it will only get worse and eventually become incurable.</p>
<p>Three to five days to about a week after visiting a prostitute, the prodromal period of gonorrhea will appear. That is, burning and stinging pain in the urethra, uncomfortable urination, and turbid fluid flowing out. After that, these symptoms will worsen, the burning pain during urination will be more severe, and pus and blood will flow out. At this time, the urethral mucosa has been frequently ulcerated due to inflammation and swelling, so using any instrument to wash the urethra at this time can easily break the deep layer of the mucosa and force the poison inward. It will not only fail to heal quickly, but will also cause complications.</p>
<p>The most reliable method that is appreciated by doctors all over the world is to use autogenous vaccine for injection and German filtration and leveling electrotherapy. In this way, one side increases the patient's resistance and reduces inflammation and swelling, and the other side can directly burn and kill the gonococci through heat penetration. Filtering and clearing the gonococci can completely cure the disease within three to five days and never recur. It is infallible.</p>

<h3>Transportation Briefs</h3>
<p>— Su</p>
<p>(1) Since the occurrence of the Great Jin incident, Tanggu Station has suddenly become deserted. Between the Taikoo or Yihua Wharf in Tanggu and the Tanggu Railway Station (a distance of several miles), there are currently no rickshaws available due to environmental reasons, and there are very few porters. The asking price for transporting luggage and other items is unusually expensive. At the same time, the inspection in Tanggu is very strict. Passengers who want to go to Tianjin or pass through Tanggu to Beiping should try to reduce the amount of luggage they carry as much as possible, which can not only save travel expenses but also avoid a lot of trouble on the way.</p>
<p>(2) Those who want to go to Hunan and Guangxi should, according to the latest transportation situation, take the route via Haiphong and then through Hanoi, Lang Son, Longzhou, and other places. It is reported that a telegram from Dong Dang, Vietnam, stated that a mountain torrent recently broke out between Lang Son and Dong Dang, so the Langlong Highway is also temporarily suspended. It is found that this mountain torrent is quite large and may not recede completely within a few days. All passengers going to Hunan and Guangxi, please pay attention to this.</p>
<p>(3) The Huangguoshu Station of the Huangping section of the Southwest Highway is located near Zhenning County, Guizhou Province, between Anshun and Annam. There are waterfalls of ten thousand feet that rush into view. Stopping to see them is a spectacular sight and is known as one of the famous scenic spots in Guizhou Province. The China Travel Service, in view of this, is actively preparing to set up the Huangguoshu Dining Hall so that passengers can enjoy the scenery while dining. The dining hall has now been completely decorated and officially opened on July 1st. The location is adjacent to the waterfall, and the dining hall can accommodate 32 people at the same time. The set meals are divided into two types, 0.5 and 0.2 yuan. It is found that the dining hall is the first-day dining station from Kunming to Guiyang and the third-day dining station from Guiyang to Kunming. All passengers traveling between Kunming and Guiyang will have the opportunity to enjoy the great view of the waterfall in the dust, which is also an excellent opportunity.</p>
<h3>Transportation in Neijiang</h3>
<p>— Bao</p>
<p>Neijiang is the center of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway, and its position is extremely important. Fifty kilometers from Neijiang is Ziliujing, the largest salt field in China (now known as Zigong City), so it has now been transformed into an important transportation hub. Because Neijiang is the midpoint of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and Highway, traffic has been frequent recently, and the transportation authorities are doing their best to dredge the water and land transportation.</p>
<p>There are two highways starting from Neijiang: one is the Neijing Highway, which goes from Neijiang to Ziliujing, 50 kilometers long, built by the Sichuan-Kang Salt Affairs Administration, and is now operated by the Yuantong Automobile Company, which is invested by merchants. The bus station is outside the West Gate of Neijiang. The route goes from Neijiang through Baima Temple, Sanduo Village, to Ziliujing, which takes two and a half hours for large vehicles. Upstream, it can reach Fushun and Weiyuan. Although there are no buses yet, it can be reached by rickshaw or sedan.</p>
<p>The fare from Neijiang to Ziliujing is 2.4 yuan per person for ordinary buses, and 18 yuan for a small chartered car with six seats. However, there are now many passengers, and you must register in advance to get a ticket. There are two shifts every day, the morning shift at 7:00 in the morning and the afternoon shift at 2:00 in the afternoon. The second route is the Lulong Highway, which is a section of the Sichuan-Yunnan Highway, 102 kilometers long, and Neijiang is now the starting point. The journey from Neijiang to Luzhou via Longchang takes five hours, and the fare for passenger cars is 5.65 yuan per person. It departs from Neijiang at 7:00 every morning.</p>
<p>After arriving in Luzhou from Neijiang, you can take a boat upstream to Chongqing, which takes two and a half days, currently operated by small steamers, including Changgang, Huadong, Minyou, Jingde, and other boats. The ticket for the economy class is 4 yuan per person, and the ticket for the cabin is 8 yuan per person. Downstream from Luzhou can reach Xufu, which takes one day by water, and the fare is 1 yuan per person. This route extends the money between Chu, Yu, and Lu. From Xufu by waterway, you can also reach Jiading. Currently, only Minjue operates on this route. When the water level rises in the future, there will be more ships.</p>
<h3>Continued Use for Studying in the United States</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>After Arriving in the United States</p>
<p>Before the ship arrives in port and disembarks, you must go through the Immigration Bureau for questioning. First- and second-class passengers are not very troublesome; the so-called doctor's examination is mostly just a formality. When answering questions, the language should be clear and simple, and do not be smart and talk endlessly. The tone should not be too British, because Americans value their national language very much. At the same time, you must also present your passport, Certificate No. 6, and the admission letter or telegram from the American school. The questions are usually very simple, but they ask about family status, study plans in the United States, etc. After the Immigration Bureau allows entry, you can collect your luggage, go through customs inspection, and then disembark. Luggage is usually arranged according to the first letter of the passenger's surname. You can find your own luggage and a customs officer will come to inspect it. Customs officers are also not very picky about inspecting students' luggage. The most important things are jewelry, decorations, tea, cigarettes, etc. All clothes and books that you usually use are not taxed, but if a man brings women's clothing or a woman brings men's clothing, unless they are traveling married couples, they will all be taxed. If there are such gifts for others or things that others have asked you to bring, you can ask male and female friends traveling with you to bring them ashore to avoid trouble. As for fresh fruits, plants, etc., they are absolutely forbidden to be brought ashore.</p>
<p>(1) On-Shore Visits Every autumn, a large number of students go to the United States to study. The Chinese consulates in San Francisco and Seattle, overseas Chinese, and other Chinese and Western organizations often hold welcome parties. Group visits are relatively easy. If there are no large groups of students traveling together, so that no one receives you when you arrive in the United States, and you are not familiar with the situation in the United States, sightseeing will naturally be a bit difficult, but if you find out the route clearly, you can also go by yourself. If you disembark in San Francisco, you can visit the Expo, Chinatown, Golden Gate Park, Golden Gate Bridge, Bay Bridge, and the University of California. You can also take a train to Los Angeles, Hollywood, and other places for a tour. For accommodation, you can stay at the Chinese YMCA Hostel. If you land in Seattle, you can visit Chinatown and the University of Washington. For accommodation, you can stay at Mars' Hotel, which specializes in receiving Chinese people, and it is very convenient for Chinese students to patronize.</p>
<p>(2) Taking the Train (or Long-Distance Bus) Except for a few students who want to take a bus to the west, central, and eastern parts to study, representatives from various railway companies will board the ship to solicit business before the ship docks. If you are willing to purchase train tickets from the China Travel Service before going abroad, you will receive special care when you arrive in the United States. If you plan to stop in port for sightseeing, you can negotiate a time with them and ask them to book a seat for you (because you may not be able to get a seat if you book at the last minute). If there are many people, it is best to buy tickets from the same company in advance, so that it will be easier for everyone to take care of each other when you arrive at your destination, regardless of whether there are friends picking you up. There are two railway companies running eastward from San Francisco: Santa Fe and Southern Pacific. Those running eastward from Seattle have Northern Pacific, Great Northern, and Chicago-Milwaukee-St. Paul Railway companies. Each company has its own strengths. No matter which company you take the train, you can enjoy various different scenery along the way. Most students studying in the United States take the coach or Tourist Class, which is more economical. In addition, there are sightseeing cars and first-class cars, but the prices are too high, and it seems too extravagant for students to take them. The fare for coach and tourist class from San Francisco and Seattle to Chicago is US$49, plus berth fee.</p>
<h3>Travel Q &amp; A</h3>
<p>Answer to Yao Ji-bao, Sun Lin-jun, Jiang Zu-heng, Chen Yu, Li Wen, Sun Bing, Ye Zhaozhang, Shen Jun, Chuan Dacheng, Xu Ziyu, Zhang Youan, Gongsun Wei, Fang Zhijun, Huang Heming: 1. Anyone wishing to travel to the interior via Ningbo must obtain a boarding guarantee from the shipping company and have it guaranteed by a reputable shop here before purchasing a ticket. See issue 19 of this publication for details. There are no special procedures for disembarking in Ningbo; only the verification of official documents is required. It is advisable to bring as little luggage as possible, and cameras are not allowed. 2. Those going to Lishui can take a steamer to Xikou after arriving in Yong, then follow the highway through Xinchang, Shengxian, Dongyang, and Yongkang to reach their destination. The journey takes more than a day, and the travel expenses are about 16 yuan. 3. The transportation situation from Ningbo to Yanping, Fujian, is described in detail in issue 19 of this publication; please refer to that article. 4. From Ningbo to Huangyan, because the coastal highway is no longer smooth, it is better to take a boat from Yong to Baiguan, then follow the highway through Shengxian, Xinchang, Tiantai, and Linhai. The journey takes two days, and the travel expenses are more than ten yuan. 5. To go to Yuqian, you can transfer to Jinhua after arriving in Yong, then take a train to Lanxi. The transportation situation between Lanxi and Yuqian is unknown. If you want to be safe, you must either go via Anhui or take a train from Shanghai to Hangzhou, then take a highway through Lin'an to reach Yuqian. However, you must have a travel permit before you can set off. 6. To get to Huizhou in Anhui, you can go via Ningbo to Jinhua, then take a train to Lanxi and then take a highway to Huizhou. The highway travel expenses from Jinhua to Huizhou are about ten yuan, and the journey takes one day. When traveling in the interior, identity documents are essential. 7. To get from Ningbo to Zhuji, you can first go to Xikou, then follow the highway through Xinchang and Shengxian to reach Zhuji. The travel expenses are 18 yuan.</p>
<p>Answer to Ding Yinghou: 1. Passports can be applied for through the China Travel Service, but it takes more than three weeks to obtain. The official cabin fare from Shanghai to Haiphong is 112 yuan in national currency, the cabin fare is 82 yuan, and the steerage fare is 44 yuan. Applying for a passport in Hong Kong in person only takes one week. 2. It is more economical to carry luggage with you. If you transport it separately, the cost of transportation by boat and car is quite high. If you bring a lot of daily necessities, you must pay taxes according to regulations. 3. Taking the train from Haiphong to Kunming takes one night for the express train and three or four days for the slow train. The fares are the same for express and slow trains: 53 Vietnamese dollars for second class, 30 dollars and 55 cents for third class, and 10 dollars and 65 cents for fourth class. (One Vietnamese dollar is about 3.2 yuan in national currency.)</p>
<p>Answer to Wang Jun: 1. There are no difficulties in bringing Western books on civil engineering when arriving in the defense zone, but the content must be checked.</p>
<p>Answer to Dong Deji: 1. To study in Moscow, Soviet Union, it was originally more economical to go via Vladivostok and then the Siberian Railway. However, this route has been suspended since the war. If you go via Dalian, it is very inconvenient for Chinese travelers. Therefore, it is better to take a ship from Shanghai to London (French Post Office third class 46 pounds), then transfer from London to Lenin Village in the Soviet Union (third class US$40). From Lenin Village, you can take a train to Moscow (third class hard seat 3 pounds per person). The whole journey takes 40 days. 2. Passports can be handled by the China Travel Service, and then the British and French consulates can be asked to add transit visas, and then the Soviet Embassy in China can be asked to add entry visas. 3. The cost of living in Moscow is quite affordable, but recently the exchange rate has skyrocketed. Studying abroad with national currency seems to be too expensive.</p>
<p>Answer to Sun Shijie: 1. To go from Shanghai to Xi'an and Lanzhou, you can first take a boat from Shanghai to Haiphong, then take the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Kunming, then follow the highway through Guiyang, Chongqing, Chengdu, and Qingyuan to reach Neian. The minimum travel expenses for the whole journey are more than 230 yuan in national currency. There are Xilan Highway buses from Xi'an to Lanzhou, and the fare is 31.5 yuan. 2. Xi'an and Lanzhou both have China Travel Service hostels. 3. Cameras cannot be carried when traveling in the interior.</p>
<p>Answer to Zhao Chong: 1. To go to Dihua, Xinjiang, you can follow the Lanxing Highway from Lanzhou to Xingxing Gorge after arriving in Lanzhou. The fare is 56.7 yuan. There is also a highway from Xingxing Gorge to Dihua, but the fare is unknown.</p>
<h3>A Respectful Announcement to Readers</h3>
<p>— Deng Bingquan</p>
<p>The publication of this journal has reached its twentieth issue today. Within this short period of time, it has adapted to the needs of the times by promptly publishing information on inland transportation, including highways, railways, airlines, and ship routes. It has exhausted its knowledge to be as detailed as possible, striving for simplicity in writing and accuracy in content. The Shenbao and the China Travel Service share the same goal of serving society, seeking mutual support and cooperation, and we hope to make a significant contribution to readers during this extraordinary period.</p>
<p>My colleagues have opened a "Q &amp; A" column to answer readers' questions about travel. We are grateful for your support, and inquiries have poured in. Each issue receives more than a hundred inquiries. Counting twenty issues, we have received no less than three thousand letters. My colleagues have numbered and answered them, and the ones published in this journal are too numerous to mention. From this, we can see the readers' strong support, and the publication of this journal by this newspaper and our agency is indeed worthwhile.</p>
<p>Now, this journal will take a temporary break from readers starting with this issue. The biggest reason is that transportation information changes rapidly. The weekly publication of this journal seems too slow. In order to provide better service, we plan to publish transportation information in this newspaper at any time in the future, so that the information obtained today can be published in the newspaper tomorrow, thus avoiding backlog, and readers can be the first to know.</p>

<h3>Diplomatic History of Burma (2)</h3>
<p>King Xifa of Burma sent an envoy with gifts, who has arrived in Lengjiang City. An order was given to prepare a ship to welcome him, which sailed for seven days before reaching the capital. When the French envoy landed, the king displayed the splendor of his military might with two rows of Pixiu and Mandarin ducks and egrets standing upright, which was truly dazzling. Then, the French envoy rode an elephant into the capital of the king. As soon as he dismounted from his palanquin, he stayed briefly in his luggage. The capital of the King of Burma is like a pigpen, with a circumference of only one li. Inside the city are magnificent palaces and towers. Outside the city, there is another city, which is twice as large as the royal city. There is also an outer city wall outside the city. There are more than 300 concubines in the palace, with a tower every five steps and a pavilion every ten steps, with pine clouds and carved windows, which are exceptionally brilliant. Outside the palace, there is an imperial garden with deer and fish in the ponds for entertainment. There is also a parliament hall and a temple. As for the Ministry of Justice, the White Elephant Office, the Silver Mint, and the Secret Artillery Bureau, all have the serene and solemn scenery of swaying trees. The walls of the royal city are made of teak. The city has four gates, but only those who are noble and of Chinese descent are allowed to enter and exit the North Gate. The king had previously set up a reception hall for the imperial envoy at the East Gate, the interior of which was very elegant. When the French envoy arrived, the king specially sent personnel to take care of him and hired a French chef to prepare meals. The imperial envoy's reception hall was guarded by soldiers, but these soldiers were not only useless for protection but also prone to theft. Whenever the imperial envoy went in or out, a soldier would always sneak behind him. The French envoy stayed for two and a half months before he was able to see the King of Burma. When he reached the inner hall, the French envoy took off his shoes and entered according to his country's customs, but he did not wear a crown. The king was furious and scolded the guide severely. The French envoy sat on a mat, tightly covering his feet, as it was not customary for the king to see his feet. The king's clothes were also very ordinary, but the diamonds were strung together like beads. After the French envoy respectfully presented the gifts, he read the national letter in one breath. When discussing peace, their opinions did not agree, because the French envoy had clauses such as allowing the establishment of consuls, companies, and the manufacture of various crafts, which the King of Burma was unwilling to allow.</p>

<h3>Children's Responsibility in High Prices</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Children, since you are also a member of society, you must not be indifferent to all the problems that occur in society. Although sometimes you don't feel it personally, everything is related to you to some extent. Let's talk about the current price increases in various industries. The families of salaried people are the most affected. Fathers and brothers who used to earn fifty yuan a month can only afford the same as they used to with thirty yuan a month due to the high prices. They used to buy half a dollar's worth of vegetables a day, but now they can only get two and a half cents worth of things. This makes the vegetables seem less, and maybe you can't often eat the fish, meat, shrimp, and crabs that you like. Because prices are high, expenses are high, but income does not increase. Therefore, parents used to often buy you toys and candy to eat, but now, fixed expenses also have to be tightened. The toys you love to play with and the candy you love to eat naturally can't be bought for you often. Watermelons, popsicles, soda, and fruit juice in the summer... these are not necessary cold drinks, although they are very seasonal, but for the sake of frugality, maybe you haven't even tasted them once. Children, are you complaining about your parents because of this? Are you dissatisfied because the vegetables are not to your liking on weekdays?</p>
<p>There are many reasons for such high prices: imported goods are skyrocketing due to foreign exchange tightening, many goods are increasing in price due to rising raw material prices, some are hoarding goods due to the control of a certain party, and there are even unscrupulous merchants hoarding and manipulating prices, taking advantage of the fire. We have no power to stabilize prices, but how to deal with this situation, in addition to our parents, children themselves also have a considerable responsibility. First, we must strictly implement frugality. When spending a penny, we must consider again and again whether the expenditure of this penny is necessary. Moreover, at present, due to the lack of copper coins, all things have a minimum price of one cent. Then, ten one cents are one dime, and the accumulation of small amounts has a big impact. Second, if you think a certain thing is necessary to buy, be determined to use domestic goods. For example, when buying toys, although there are certain goods that are cheap, if they are not domestic goods, it is better not to buy them. This period is the best opportunity to promote domestic goods. Third, investigate the reasons for the price increase of a certain product. On the one hand, it allows us to understand the raw materials and processes of product manufacturing, increase our knowledge of industry and commerce, and on the other hand, we can supervise merchants to see if they are speculating. If it is indeed an unscrupulous merchant taking advantage of the fire, then I should fulfill the responsibility of persuading and warning them. We are the small masters of the era and should take on the responsibility of small masters.</p>
<p>Children, our knowledge and abilities are valuable only when they are obtained from practical experience, and this is precisely the opportunity for us to gain practical experience!</p>
<h3>How Are Elephants Captured?</h3>
<p>— Wisdom</p>
<p>Children: Have you ever seen a circus performance? Where did the many elephants in the circus come from? They were bought from people who specialize in catching elephants. So how do people who specialize in catching elephants catch them? Below are some methods of how to catch elephants:</p>
<p>These elephants are mostly captured when they are very large, because elephants need to go through a long period of time to grow. Therefore, catching a large grown elephant is more cost-effective than raising a small elephant.</p>
<p>Wild elephants often appear in the jungles of tropical regions such as Asia and Africa. They often travel in groups. A group is made of 20 or 30 elephants, and sometimes there can be up to more than 100 elephants. The elephant herds are often led by an elephant who knows where to get food and drinks. The leading elephant is often a female elephant.</p>
<p>Catching wild elephants is a very difficult task. Elephant catchers often use trained elephants to help them. They build a huge and strong fence made of wood that is a foot thick and more than ten feet long, and then covered with green bark or vines. Leave one or two gaps as entrances. These doors should be designed so that the elephant herds can be closed immediately after being driven into the fence.</p>
<p>After the fence is built, the elephant catchers can wait for the elephants to come. When a herd of elephants approaches the fence, a large group of people surrounds them, holding torches and shaking and shouting as much as possible to drive the elephant herd into the fence. After all the elephants have entered, the fence door is immediately closed. The elephants are very strong. If they hit the fence, the fence must collapse. So when an elephant hits the fence, the elephant catchers use torches and other things to scare it back. After some time, these elephants no longer want to escape. At this time, the elephant catchers release a batch of trained elephants. These trained elephants are complete "elephant traitors." They will lure and monitor the wild elephants. The elephant catchers also quietly walk into the fence and tie up the wild elephants one by one with strong ropes. These wild elephants were captured. After a considerable period of training, they can be sold: and they have also become "elephant traitors" to lure other wild elephants?</p>
<h3>Barbaric Customs</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>— Ming'er's Unforgettable Record No. 27 —</p>
<p>A group of refugees spent seven or eight days before stepping into the mountains of Anhui. Ming'er gradually became accustomed to the boring life on the boat, and he ate more than usual. Three bowls of rice were nothing to him. It was really strange that although they had tasted the bitterness of being refugees, spending these days on the boat had made Ming'er fatter. It was probably because he ate more and used less brainpower, living a pig-like life.</p>
<p>When the sun set in the west and the sky was not yet dark, the Jiangshan boat docked on the shore. "What place is this?" "Shendu," the boatman replied casually. Ming'er saw that it was still early and felt bored sitting in the cabin. It would be better to go ashore and take a walk. Moreover, the boat was staying here overnight, so he was not afraid of the boatman urging him. Ming'er mumbled as he went ashore. "What are the differences between Anhui and Zhejiang?" His older brother standing on the bow of the boat heard these words.</p>
<p>"Mingdi, look, the hills here have been fully utilized by the farmers of Anhui. One row of bean fields after another is arranged on the mountains. The fields are full of broad beans. From this, we can see that the terrain of Anhui is mountainous. Otherwise, who would be happy to go to the mountains to farm? This is because there is too little arable land on the plains. They have to be forced to go to the mountains to farm in order to maintain their lives. The Zhejiang we passed through has more plains, so they no longer use the mountains. Isn't this the difference between Anhui and Zhejiang? It can be seen that knowledge is available everywhere, as long as you carefully search for it, and the living knowledge you find is much more useful than the limited dead knowledge in books, do you think that's right?" His older brother said this. His mother called him to go ashore with him to take care of his younger brother.</p>
<p>As soon as the two of them set foot on the shore, the first thing that made them feel different was that there were latrines everywhere. The style of each latrine was almost the same, with a very unified spirit. Each one was covered with a pavilion that looked like a policeman's stand, but without a bottom. A stench filled the area around it, which was its sphere of influence. There were truly small pits every three steps and large pits every five steps. The custom of foot binding was also very popular here. Ming'er almost laughed out loud when he saw it. Just imagine: the heads of girls who are only about ten years old have a heavy, drooping bun that occupies one-third of the entire head. Dragging such a large sideburn behind the girl's small head, is it considered beautiful? They also bind their feet, making them small and exquisite (?). When they walk, they move their lotus steps gently, how graceful! Large buns and small feet, which local people at this time think are beautiful. Each of them is holding a bamboo basket in both hands, hidden in a cloth skirt, walking back and forth on the street. (Because it was late autumn, the climate there was already very cold. The bamboo basket contained charcoal for warmth, and the local people called it a "baking basket.") This strange behavior could not help but make Ming'er laugh. But there was a different feeling in his older brother's eyes, and he gently said to his younger brother: "You're still laughing, I can almost cry. It's precisely the time when their bodies are developing, but they are forcibly turning them into this strange appearance, making them have the old age of old people, and their deformed development turns into adults. How can the children they give birth to be strong? So I think it's better to let them go and be happy, don't harm future generations. This barbaric custom still exists in modern times, no wonder China has the nickname of 'Sick Man of East Asia.'" Ming'er's older brother said a lot, and Ming'er felt it was very right. The two of them didn't want to watch any longer, so they hurriedly returned to the boat.</p>
<p>That night, the sound of the rapids near the Jiangshan boat was gurgling, as if it was complaining for the group of poor girls, but what was the use? "I must reform this barbaric custom in the future!" Ming'er murmured in the dark cabin.</p>

<h3>Homemade Stationery Printing Machine</h3>
<p>— Wang Zufu</p>
<p>Printing machine. Do you often hear it in your ears? You also often see its works. The test papers, holiday slips, and leave slips in schools are probably all printed by printing machines. Most schools have one or two in stock. Because its cost is very low and it is very convenient, it is very common.</p>
<p>Now I will introduce to you children how to make a small printing machine. It only costs a few cents to make one yourself. Now I will write the materials, tools, construction method, and usage below.</p>
<p>Materials: One white wax candle, three cigarette cans, one piece of plywood or thick paper seven inches long and five inches wide, three picture nails, a few large sheets of paper, and one lead wire.</p>
<p>Tools: Alcohol lamp, old western knife, scissors, fountain pen (the nib must be G-shaped)</p>
<p>Construction Method: Wax paper, put the alcohol lamp (the alcohol lamp can be made with a glue bottle) in the cigarette can, and cover it with another one. A hole needs to be opened on the side to put a little candle oil on it. On the bottom of the cigarette can, slightly soak a large sheet of paper in the candle oil, and the wax will be evenly spread on the paper. Then change to another place so that the candle oil is completely applied. After cooling, cut it into six inches long and three and a half inches wide. (See Figure 1)</p>
<p>Steel Plate: Cut the cigarette can into a flat piece of lead skin. The size is optional. Use an old western knife to draw a cross like (Figure 2).</p>
<p>Ink Stick: Cut a three-inch-long piece of wax candle, remove the wick in the middle, and thread the lead wire through the hole. Then pliers it into the shape of (Figure 3).</p>
<p>Ink: After concentrating the ink, add a little paste and grind it again. It must not be too thick.</p>
<p>Construction Method</p>
<p>Write the words you need on the wax paper with a fountain pen on the steel plate. Cover a sheet of white newspaper on top, the same size as the wax paper. Use picture nails to firmly press the two papers on the plywood or thick paper. Place a few smaller sheets of white paper under the wax paper. (See Figure 4) The work department is over, just apply oil and wait for printing.</p>
<p>Usage: Put a little thick ink on the newspaper above the wax paper. After applying it, put the paper down, and then apply a thin layer of ink on it. Push the ink stick forward (need weight). Finally, take up the newspaper and wax paper together: the white paper below will be printed with very clear black characters. Then put it down and print the second sheet. Just push it again on the newspaper above. After printing a few sheets, add some ink again. One sheet of paper can print dozens of sheets.</p>
<p>Reason: Why add paste to the black? Because ink is easy to dissolve, so adding paste will make it sticky, so it will not dissolve.</p>
<p>Although this kind of small craft is not widely used, it is quite interesting. I hope you children will follow the above methods and do further research when trying it.</p>
<h3>Animal Realm (10) (1)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>So, those animals all gathered around, forming a large circle, with Peng Qi in the center. Old Man Frog, who lived in the nearby ditch, was pushed forward by Fork Grandpa to take on the job of lookout. This Old Man Frog had particularly large eyes, so he was perfectly suited for the lookout post. He maintained a very calm and cautious demeanor. During Peng Qi's trial, Old Man Frog kept shouting, "Gak, gak, gak!" seemingly as a form of warning.</p>
<p>At that moment, the lion, like a judge, opened its mouth and asked, "What is the matter for which you accuse this sinner?"</p>
<p>Upon hearing these words, everyone looked around, hoping to push the Titmouse forward to explain everything. But, just like those humans who only know how to stir up trouble but refuse to take responsibility, it had taken advantage of the chaotic and unsettled moment and flown away long ago. So, the other animals had to struggle to remember and recount all the accusations they had previously heard about Peng Qi.</p>
<p>"He abuses dogs, even throwing them into the water to drown them alive. When he catches cats, he tortures them to death –" Seeing them enumerate his crimes so concretely, Peng Qi was secretly shocked and quickly interrupted, "It was Le Fu who killed the cats—" Old Man Frog seemed to disagree with Peng Qi's words, suddenly shouting "Gak!" to prevent Peng Qi from continuing.</p>
<p>The lion, adopting the solemn attitude of a judge, issued a command: "Bring Le Fu here!" Immediately, a special envoy set off to summon Le Fu.</p>
<p>Just then, a beautiful rooster strutted forward and crowed loudly, "Ooh, ooh, ooh! Flap, flap, flap! (Sound of flapping wings) Since you are going to summon witnesses, you must summon one more. Ooh, ooh, ooh! No other rooster is allowed to speak while I am speaking. Do you know a young rogue who likes cockfighting and does evil? I know such a person, and his name is Xiao Tang. Bring him here and put him together with his good friend Peng Qi. We will tie heavy iron to their heels, have them kick each other back and forth, and pluck out their eyeballs. This is a very rare and good game. All games are interesting, and we must encourage them from the sidelines. Ooh, ooh, ooh!" As he spoke, he flapped his wings.</p>
<p>Just as the rooster raised his toes, ready to crow again, they suddenly heard a series of footsteps and the clanging of a collar chain. It turned out that the鬃毛dog Le Fu had already clumsily walked into their circle, twitching his short ears and stiff tail.</p>
<p>As soon as the lion saw him approach, it opened its mouth and said, "Mr. Le Fu, according to this criminal, you are the one who abused the raccoons, not—"</p>
<p>Le Fu jumped around wildly, barking, "Woof, woof, woof! Whose fault is this? Woof, woof, woof! Who taught me to do it? Woof, woof! It was that bad kid, Peng Qi, woof, woof! I wish I could grab his spine and throw him around like a madman. Woof, woof, woof!"</p>
<p>Everyone was very excited by these words and clamored for a moment. Then they heard the crowd shouting, "Keep order! Keep order!" And then all around was quiet.</p>
<p>Under the lion's interrogation, Le Fu insisted that his behavior towards the cats was entirely due to the teaching and instigation of people like Peng Qi. Sometimes, in moments of frenzy, he didn't like cats, so it was inevitable that he would chase and harm them. But in fact, he had always been friendly to the cats in his own home. They were in the same kitchen, very harmonious, and even ate from the same plate, never arguing. He also admitted that it was in his nature to tear things, and that he liked to tear everything hairy. But he didn't necessarily have to insult hairy creatures; a hairy slipper or other furry objects would satisfy him.</p>

<p>Report on Livelihood</p>
<h3>National Goods Salesperson</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Due to unemployment and the pressure of life, and unable to find other suitable work, I was introduced by a friend to join the ×× National Goods Service Cooperative as a salesperson, with a deposit of "40 yuan at the limit". It was a gathering place for unemployed youth, a good opportunity for those transitioning to find employment. But the truth is undeniable: we, this group of unemployed youth, are struggling on the edge of starvation, and are tasting the hardships and pains of the human world!</p>
<p>Every day, at seven o'clock in the morning, we go to the cooperative to pick up goods, then everyone carries a rattan box or briefcase, and disperses, heading towards each person's "new road" aimlessly. In the lanes of residential households, or in shops that don't conflict with our business, and in public places that might allow us to peddle, we open the box and use words to move the hearts of customers. But we have a uniform price, we don't haggle with big customers, and we never allow bargaining. This price is about two to five cents cheaper per item than in stores with "genuine no bargaining". Because this national goods service cooperative for relieving unemployment has a history of more than two years, every customer knows our sales purpose well and has a good impression. Therefore, they either don't buy our goods, or if they buy, they will never treat us the same as ordinary merchants—there are often difficulties with bargaining.</p>
<p>The goods we sell are daily necessities, but limited to national products, divided into more than 40 kinds, including cosmetics, parts and hardware, parts and medicines, school supplies, celluloid products, etc. Because I started working at the cooperative in late spring, the goods I sell, in addition to toothbrushes, toothpaste, combs, cigarette holders, pencils, etc., are mostly summer necessities: cologne, prickly heat powder, Bagua Dan, Ren Dan... In short, our business also needs to adapt to the seasons.</p>
<p>The profit margin of our products is about two percent. Our division of profits with the cooperative is calculated at a ratio of two to eight, that is, the cooperative gets 20% and the members get 80%. Each member's monthly sales must be at least 60 yuan, otherwise their qualification will be revoked. However, if the first member's sales are only 60 yuan per month, how can the 80% of this meager profit be enough for a month's food expenses? Not to mention other living expenses! However, just this 60 yuan in sales is already very difficult, and it is even more difficult for a new member to earn this amount!</p>
<p>I have been doing this job for three months. In these three months, all day long—whether it is sunny or rainy, I am always running with other members, my legs and waist are very sore and painful. But the sales amount for the first month, after much effort, was only 60 yuan. The second and third months increased to 70 yuan, but that was only enough for food expenses. I know that I am running on a long journey of starvation every day, suffering from pain. As for the other thirty or forty long-term companions, their sales amount will not exceed 100 yuan at most. Under the current phenomenon of soaring prices, such a division of income makes it extremely difficult to maintain life. However, our spirit is happy, because no matter what, we are still earning our own living. After all, we are much more comforted in conscience than the "brokers" who sell inferior goods. We firmly believe that as long as we fight to the end, we will definitely have a bright future.</p>

<h3>A Flower in the Slum</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"One Third of a Nation"</p>
<p>The theme of "A Flower in the Slum" is somewhat related to us on this isolated island. In the slums of New York, the houses are dilapidated, but the landlords don't pay attention. When a fire breaks out, a child named Joey falls from the fire escape and breaks his leg. Joey's sister, Mary, scolds the landlord Peter, and Peter agrees to demolish the old houses and build new ones. The film ends with a large-scale construction and the establishment of new residences.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, we often hear tragedies caused by dilapidated houses. However, the current problem is not here. Even if the landlord is willing to demolish the old houses, few tenants are willing to move. Do they want to bet their lives on the dilapidated houses? Of course not! The problem is whether the rents of the new houses after they are built are affordable for these old tenants. The playwright of "A Flower in the Slum" can bring together people from two completely different classes, and this intention is commendable, but he has overlooked the final condition. In addition to sympathy, we also need mutual help, especially at this time and place.</p>
<p>Regarding the performance, under the director's excellent skills, the whole play is very lively, compact, and especially the editing is brisk. To give a few examples: (1) After Joey is injured, he takes Peter's car to the hospital. The director uses three long shots to create a strong contrast between the slums and the magnificent residences. When Mary meets Peter, he also uses the same long shots to show the disparity between these two different classes. (2) After Joey breaks his leg and returns to the slum, his companions' playing football and bathing make Joey hate the old house because he has lost his freedom of movement. Others, such as Mary and others being happy that Peter is willing to demolish the old house and rebuild a new house, but Peter's sister is calculating the cost and arguing with Peter. And Peter kicks things over when he comes to the slum, while Mary can run around with the servants when she comes to Peter's house, etc. Although the whole play does not have big scenes and obvious climaxes, the proper use of this contrast technique is the success of the performance.</p>
<p>Sylvia Sidney's Mary and Fredric March's Peter both worked hard. What is even more worth mentioning is the child who played Joey, who has amazing achievements.</p>
<p>Readers who are tired of romance movies about urban young masters and young ladies, I recommend this "A Flower in the Slum" to you.</p>

<h3>Biographical Sketches of Female Storytellers</h3>
<p>— Shen You</p>
<p>Now, excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Kong Zhiye, maiden name Geng Geng, is a female Suzhou storyteller. At the age of seventeen or eighteen, with unparalleled beauty and a very solitary and pure nature, she must be invited in many ways before she slowly comes. If there is something that offends her, she will remain silent all day long... Yan Sheng of Maoyuan, Shen Cun... recognized Kong Zhi during a banquet, her demeanor was dignified, and she had no flattering attitude at all. Sheng secretly thought that most of the people in the academy were dissolute, but he did not expect that there would be such a stable person, and he felt quite pity... After a long period of intimacy, they agreed to marry, although it was not as unrestrained, it was even more intimate than eyebrow painting. Sheng lived by the river, and one day, he leaned on the railing and gazed. Suddenly, he saw a painted boat parked next to the rocks, with a girl in it, vaguely visible, just a glance, and her beauty was unparalleled, even better than Kong Zhi. He stared at her for a long time, and the girl opened the window to peek. When asked, she said that she was a schoolgirl named Shu Qing, the daughter of a boatman, and her father had gone to Huai Shang and had not returned... She also said that she was willing to serve him... Sheng nodded, and then gradually became distant from Kong Zhi. Kong also suspected that he had another woman, and glimpsed a bracelet on his arm, knowing that it was an object from a lady's chamber, and asked where it came from, Sheng could not hide it... When Shu Qing's father returned, he was bribed with a large sum of money, and the matter was settled. With the auspicious day approaching, Sheng was restless day and night, planning for money and goods, and also had no time to see Kong Zhi, Kong Zhi hated him very much, and pretended to be going to Tiger Hill, hired a boat, went into the boat and looked at Shu Qing, who was standing tall and graceful, her eyebrows and eyes like paintings, and felt that she was not as good as her. She talked to her casually, and the two fell in love with each other... They understood each other, turned jealousy into love, and Shu wanted Kong to serve Yan Sheng together... When the day came, Sheng swept the courtyard and gathered his relatives and friends. Near noon, everyone said, "The bridal sedan chair is coming!" He went out to see, and it was Kong Zhi. Sheng said, "You must not have forgotten the oath we made by the incense burner..." Then another sedan chair arrived, and a woman came out with small steps, it was Shu Qing... At this time, Sheng stood there foolishly, his wife was shocked, the two girls laughed silently, and the guests were all looking at each other in dismay, not knowing what was going on. Kong Zhi had already abandoned her career and hid in Shu Qing's boat. On this day, Sheng's family welcomed them with sedan chairs, first sending Kong to the sedan chair, and then Shu arrived later. Sheng's wife was virtuous, and the two girls were obedient and able to manage the affairs of the family. When they had time, Kong Zhi played the pipa, and Shu Qing sang boat songs, and they were very happy...</p>
<p>The various types of female storytellers are now briefly described. However, most of them were active before the tenth year of Guangxu (1884). After this, Peking opera rose, and storytelling was no longer popular with the audience. Therefore, in "Shanghai Bamboo Branch Lyrics" by Qingxi Yueyuan Ren Shou Louzhu, there is a sentence: "For the sake of loving to listen to Peking opera tunes, the pipa is replaced with the moon lute." The books published later, such as "Shanghai Games Illustrated" (1899), "Biographies of Shanghai Flowers" (1903), and "Miscellaneous Records of Shanghai Pleasure Trips" (1908), are not like the "Shanghai Pleasure Guide" and "Miscellaneous Records of Shanghai Courtesans" published before the third year of Guangxu (1877), which must have descriptions of "female storytellers".</p>
<p>"Female Storytellers" is divided into six chapters, about 80,000 words, and is published on alternating days with "After the Rain, the Sky is Clear", appropriately one chapter per month, and completed in six days. Now, because "Spring and Autumn" will reduce its size starting next month, the two long stories cannot be taken care of at the same time, so when "Female Storytellers" ends, it will also be temporarily suspended, and will be published in succession when the original state is restored in the future. We hereby apologize to the author and readers. Editor</p>
<h3>An Appeal from Low-Salaried Employees</h3>
<p>— Ren An</p>
<p>Recently, foreign exchange has shrunk sharply, and all commodities have soared in price. The price of rice has also risen sharply to more than 20 yuan due to the manipulation of speculators. Although the Public Works Department has strictly enforced price limits, the upward trend has not been curbed. According to the statistics of the Public Works Department, the cost of living index in June has risen to 176.15; the wages of workers can only抵到the 56.77 of the 25th year. People living on this isolated island are all complaining, especially those who live on salaries. Therefore, companies, factories, banks, and shops mostly have plans to subsidize employees.</p>
<p>I am a small employee in the largest cultural institution in the country. Not only do we not have any subsidies, but our original salary of 32 yuan has been reduced by 10%. Because the actual salary is less than 30 yuan, (those below 30 yuan have already restored their original salary in April this year) so the difference is made up to 30 yuan. A family of three, after paying 10 yuan for rent, five斗of white rice, and one担of coal balls each month, only has six or seven yuan left. Undoubtedly, in addition to running on two legs every morning and evening, what fills our stomachs at noon is not fried dough sticks and pancakes, but陽春noodles plus one. Occasionally eating a bowl of汤面is already an exception. But this kind of minimum standard of living still cannot be maintained.</p>
<p>The long-awaited announcement of restoring the original salary and subsidizing low-salaried employees was finally posted the day before yesterday. The method is that starting in August, all salaries, large and small, will be restored to their original levels. At the same time, the bonus method will also be cancelled. Except for salaries below 20 yuan (originally reduced by 20%), and below 30 yuan (originally reduced by 30%), which have been restored to their original levels, special consideration will be given to adding a small amount. The current discount situation is written below:</p>
<p>(1) Original salary from 30 yuan to 50 yuan: 90% (originally reduced by 30%)</p>
<p>(2) Original salary from 50 yuan to 100 yuan: 80% (originally reduced by 40%)</p>
<p>(3) Original salary from 100 yuan to 400 yuan: 70% (originally reduced by 50%)</p>
<p>(4) Original salary from 400 yuan to 1000 yuan: 60% (originally reduced by 60%)</p>
<p>Looking at the above methods of restoring the original salary, those with high salaries can restore 40%; those with low salaries can only restore 10%. In other words, those with high salaries can restore up to 400 yuan, and those with low salaries can only restore up to 5 yuan. Moreover, in fact, low-salaried employees with salaries below 50 yuan not only did not get the restored 10%, but were instead exploited. Taking my salary of 32 yuan as an example, after restoring the original salary, on the surface, I get 2 yuan more each month, and 24 yuan more per year. However, the cancellation of the bonus method will cause you to lose about half a month's salary every half year, which is a loss of 32 yuan per year. This method is obviously inappropriate for the treatment of low-salaried employees. Now, we sincerely hope that the company authorities can have a method to compensate low-salaried employees, such as giving each person a subsidy of three to five yuan per month, or imitating the method of subsidizing employees of a certain large bookstore, using the price of rice as the standard for subsidies (see this magazine on the 26th). In short, it is necessary to maintain the minimum standard of living for low-salaried employees.</p>

<p>Random Notes on Entertainers</p>
<h3>Stage and Screen (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xia Xia</p>
<p>—My Parental Home and Married Home</p>
<p>Editor's introduction: Xia Xia is a Beijing girl with a great talent for drama. She came to Shanghai three years ago and played the role of顧媽in the stage play "Sai Jinhua", which was a great success and made her famous at the time. Later, she moved to the film industry and also achieved many excellent results. In terms of literature, she is especially well-cultivated and can write her own scripts and also serve as a director. Recently, the Silver Union Drama Society performed the play "Deferred Debt Repayment", which was her debut work as a director. The Xinhua authorities value her talent, and it is said that she will be promoted to director. Her future is unlimited. She is truly a multi-talented and exceptional female entertainer who is different from the constant flow.</p>
<p>The stage is my parental home, and the screen is my married home. I remember that this magazine said that about me, and it also included some words of encouragement, saying something like, "A married daughter is like water that has been poured out. Although you have arrived at your married home, don't let down the education you received from your parental home." This metaphor is quite appropriate. I jumped from the stage to the screen, just like marrying from my parental home to my married home. However, I am not a married daughter who is like water that has been poured out, because until now, I have never completely forgotten my parental home. Although my whole heart and body have arrived at my married home, in reality, I am still standing between my parental home and my married home. I love my parental home, and I also love my married home. I don't want to leave my parental home to go to my married home, and I am reluctant to stay in my parental home and not go to my married home. In a word: the stage and the screen occupy the same position in my heart. I love and covet them equally, and I am willing to be a loyal and promising good daughter in both places. Here, I would like to talk about my past relationship with my parental home and my married home, the current situation, and my future hopes, in three sections: That was three years ago! I got my family's permission, left school, and came to Shanghai to engage in the shadow play life that I had longed for for many years. At this time, carrying a beautiful dream and this ardent hope, I jumped on the Pinghu through train. Although it took thirty or forty hours on the road, I didn't close my eyes for an hour or sleep for an hour. At that time, that kind of excitement and nervousness made it impossible for me to calm down. Looking back now, it's really funny and pitiful!</p>
<p>When I arrived in Shanghai, because I was unfamiliar with the place, I didn't have any relatives or friends, only a teacher who taught me in the north helped me. But he didn't have any deep connections with the film industry either, and all he could do was to brag and introduce me. Shanghai is so big, and there are so many talents. A girl like me, who is not surprising and still has a bit of northern bluntness, of course didn't attract people's attention. So, after working hard for several days, I didn't have any clues.</p>
<p>After ten days of wandering and anxiety, I couldn't eat well, I couldn't sleep peacefully, and my brain was almost empty. I couldn't think of a way, and I was just longing for the door of the shadow play circle. But, "Where there's a will, there's a way." That's right. Although I deeply felt that I had no way to turn to and no one to help me, I didn't lose heart, give up hope. When I was busy during the day and there were no results, in the quiet of the night, I lay on the bed and comforted myself, saying: "Wait! Although today has passed without hope, there is still tomorrow? Tomorrow may bring hope, who knows."</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Significance of a Ten-Minute Break Before the Main Act</p>
<p>That kind of deliberate expression that makes you angry is really difficult for even the largest person at Xiamen University to tolerate. Often, arguments in theaters (i.e., quarrels and fights) mostly start from this. There is also another layer: modern plays are different from before. In the past, there were at least three or four plays to listen to every day. Now, a lot of money is spent just to listen to the last play (i.e., the main act). Who knows how many hours of suffering have been endured. Just when you are about to concentrate on listening to the main act on stage, suddenly a group of people come, those who collect tickets collect tickets, those who want tea money want tea money, and others who have money in their hands and send money for clothes and hats keep bothering you. If you give less, of course they will argue. Even if you give a few more coins in order to avoid trouble and listen to the play peacefully, then they will treat you as a big shot, and those who bow and greet you will also ask you to rise higher. How can you listen to the play in this way? Moreover, every spring, many members of foreign tour groups flock to visit Ping. Many of them who love Chinese drama also often step into the dirty and narrow Chinese theaters. Not only are they similarly harassed by the above-mentioned problems, but they also see the strange sight of handkerchiefs flying all over the theater upstairs and downstairs. Therefore, some foreign guests with wicked tongues say that not only the actors on the Chinese stage can perform, but even the tea servants in the theater can fight.</p>
<p>In view of the above-mentioned bad situation, I decided to first order each garden to take a ten-minute break before the main act. The drums on the stage are stopped, and at the same time, the people offstage can take a pee, chat, and peddlers selling cigarettes, fruits, etc., can sell during this time. Those who collect tickets and tea money also take advantage of this time to get things done. Each garden is different in size, and the number of attendees is uncertain. Although it is nominally a ten-minute break, in fact, everything is collected and counted. The tea servants are also limited by time, so they don't dare to demand too much. When all the matters in the front stage are completed, the main act continues to take the stage. The actors concentrate and exert themselves, and the audience concentrates on the stage. With order restored, the whole theater is naturally quiet. The performers don't waste their energy, and the customers' ticket prices are not wasted either. This is the meaning of the suggestion to take a ten-minute break before the main act at that time. (70)</p>
<h3>Writing a Good Script</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>A senior Hollywood director once said that a good film script must have the following elements: (1) the plot must be tense, (2) the dialogue should be humorous, (3) the meaning should be implicit, (4) it should be sensual, but not vulgar or too revealing, (5) there should be a description of aristocratic life. Based on the above, we have written a script. This script not only satisfies the above conditions, but is also very short and concise. If you don't believe me, look at the following: "The Duchess laughed and said, 'Your Majesty, don't pull my leg like that.'" (Excerpted from "Analects" Two Flower Column)</p>
<h3>Wild Grasses and Idle Flowers</h3>
<p>— A Literary Person</p>
<p>— Regarding the Charity Photo Exhibition of Stars</p>
<p>At the current charity photo exhibition of stars, the photo of Yuan Meiyun taken by NurnberOne of the Shanghai Photo Studio has already been ordered by Miss Zhou. The photo of Wang Yang taken by [Village] Photo Studio has received the most orders so far. In the photo, Wang Yang is standing with a horse, exuding a charming posture. Mr. Xu, the Yiming Photo Studio, You Qi [company name], the Daxin Company, and Mr. Wu have each ordered a copy.</p>
<p>Yesterday around 10 a.m., Chen Yunshang, along with Chen Yanyan, Li Minghui, Hua Jieni, and Chen's mother, arrived gracefully. Chen wore a light pink and white Western suit, with silk ribbons in her hair, dancing like butterflies. Her beauty was stunning, and her smile was warm and inviting, evoking the feeling of "clouds evoking thoughts of clothing, flowers evoking thoughts of her face."</p>
<p>Several of the stars' photos have been used as covers for movie magazines. For example, the photo of "Lu Ming standing with an umbrella" was previously used as the cover of "Electric Sound," and the photo of "Tan Ying amidst flowers and grass" was also used as the cover of "Qingqing Movie."</p>
<p>Color photos are priced at one hundred yuan, and there are fewer buyers. However, the Yantai Changyu Wine Company specifically ordered one of Zhou Xuan. It is said that the company's Deputy Manager Zhu Mei admires her innocence, liveliness, and clear voice, and will soon film a promotional film "Grape Fairy," and may invite Zhou Xuan to star in it.</p>
<p>In this exhibition, there are only a few photos of male stars such as Zhang Yi, Shi Chao, Gao Zhanfei, and Shang Guanwu. Besides personal photos, Lao Shang also has a photo with Xiao Gao. Amidst the rumors of Lao Gao and Bai Yang's passionate love affair, Xiao Gao will surely feel some emotions! Shang Guanwu's heroic posture truly deserves to be the epitome of a great merchant. Nowadays, there are few people in the film industry who can take on this type of role, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Starting from August 1st, this publication will reduce its size by two-fifths. Therefore, future submissions should be kept concise. Except for special features, each article should not exceed 700 words. We hope that all contributors will pay special attention to this. (Editor)</p>
<h3>The Art of Skating (30)</h3>
<p>— Co-edited by Lian Junqi and Zhen</p>
<p>Conclusion on Four Edges</p>
<p>When learning the four edges, you must pay attention to the following four points: (A) When moving on the outside edge of the shoe, the movement of the free foot should always be outside the drawn circle.</p>
<p>The solid line in the diagram below shows the supporting foot, and the dashed line shows the path of the free foot.</p>
<p>(B) When moving on the inside edge of the shoe, the free leg must cross the supporting leg to the outside of the drawn circle. However, when moving to the front and passing the supporting leg (point A in the diagram), it must temporarily go inside the drawn circle, and then return to the outside of the circle after passing. The dashed line in the diagram shows the path of the free foot.</p>
<p>(C) After practicing the four edges, you must also pay attention to the form and position of the arcs drawn. The end of the first arc and the beginning of the second arc must be extended into a straight line, meaning the same direction of movement, so that the circle will not lose its shape.</p>
<p>(1) The abbreviation in the diagram below indicates the direction to take each step when moving from point a to point b.</p>
<p>(2) The abbreviation in the diagram below indicates that the direction taken when starting a step is incorrect, causing the position of the circle to shift.</p>
<p>This point is most easily seen when crossing the feet. The reason why it is difficult to learn to cross the feet forward and backward is that beginners do not understand this principle and do not know that the trajectory of movement is an arc.</p>
<p>(D) When skating in an arc, the whole body does not face forward. The body should be sideways, and the shoulders and hips should be parallel to the supporting foot at the beginning, and then gradually move to the position at the beginning of the second step along the arc of the first step.</p>
<p>Once the basics of the four edges are established, any patterns can be easily learned in the future.</p>
<p>Announcement from this publication: The Art of Skating has been published for thirty issues, totaling over 20,000 words. We are deeply grateful for the readers' love and discussion through letters! The introductory skating guide has now concluded with this issue and will no longer be published. We plan to organize the published and unpublished advanced skating techniques into a separate book. The content will be as rich and beautiful as possible. We will announce the publication date when it is available. We hope readers will pay attention.</p>
