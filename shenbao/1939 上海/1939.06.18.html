<p>（倫敦）今日此間官塲表示意見、如本週杪天津局勢不見起色、則英政府將有三種途徑可行、</p>
<p>最惠國名單中、刪除日本、　廢止一九一一年英日條的、而將日本摒棄於英國與英屬殖民地各大市塲之外、　對日貨徵收重稅、衆信此種計畫、將使日本經濟地位已受代價奇大的兩年戰爭之影響者、更受跋重打擊、大的星期一日下院中將發表關於時局之言論、商部財部與外部人員、在過去三日中、研究應付時局之各種方法、現用報告書形式繕擬其建議、如本週杪時局不改善、則政府可採行數種計畫、包括上述辦法在內、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於天津事件、內閣閣員現正靜待賡賴接獲報告、張伯倫省相已於昨夜離京、往迄葛斯鎭消度週末假期、惟仍與唐寗街首相官邸保持密切接觸、此間接近外交部人士、雖希望日本政府能幡然改圖、與英國進行談判、覓取解決方式、但謂遇有必要時、英國決當採取報復措置、至其方式若何、在最近三日來曾由商務·財政·外務·三部官吏、加以硏究、並已擬就報告書、準備提付內閣討論、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據昨晚倫敦外交界消息、關於日方封鎖天津英和界及鼓浪嶼事件英政府已決定對日採取經濟報復、據云此項經濟報復政策內容、將於下星期一英內閣非常會議中決定之、同時、英外部仍與法美兩國密切接觸中、此間官方對日方不斷悔辱英僑、極爲憤怒、據彼等云、日方目的係企圖改變英方對遠東政策、及中英關係、據英方半官式之文告云、苟日方繼續迫使英方接受新條件、必將引起極嚴重之局勢、使英政府不得不考慮立即取有效步驟、保障英國在華利益、一般人認爲此項半官式文告、係英國對日本最後一分鐘之建議、政府方面認爲日方與英國重開談判之希望　極爲微薄、蓋日方談判原則、恐仍不能爲英政府所接受也、又據昨日該項文告稱、「英方對日木進一步之要求極爲重視、良以該項要求將影響各强在華之權益也」、關於最近天津日本發言人所發出之恫嚇、該項文告復稱、「由是觀之、日方封鎖英租界、決非由於英方拒絕引渡四華人所致」、該項文告繼云、關於英方企圖以地方事件解決糾紛一節、英政府深望日方能加以重新考慮、昨晚起、英官方咸主張對日採取經濟報復、商務部專家等已將經濟報復計畫呈內閣審查通過、又英內閣疑召集九國公的各國會議（包括美國）、考慮遠東問題、（十七日美聯社電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）關於中國天津市日軍封鎖英法兩租界事、此間負責方面昨所發表半官性質之聲明、頃由各報加以評論、泰晤士報載稱「英國政府態度甚爲顯明、質言之對於四華人引渡問題、仍主張組織聯席委員會、不論此項委員會作何建議、均當加以執行、即使與英國意志相反、亦所不顧、反之天津日軍當局若果固執成見、繼續推行其高壓手段、則英國實逼處此惟有採取報復手段而已、每日畫報論調尤爲強硬、而以「日本必須昇以教訓」爲言、又謂「現有若干問題、須一吐爲快、質言之、即日本人果視吾人爲何物乎、其視其他各國之在遠東經商者爲何物乎、要之、吾人欲使日本恢復理智、除用武力而外、尚有其他方法甚多」云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）金融泰晤士報頃就中國天津事件發表社評、略謂、「日本方面茲謀樹立一種先例、影響所及所及（英國商務行將擯諸中國之外、觀於日方發言人所作聲明、實已毫無疑議）此外尚有一點足使現行局勢更關嚴重、即他國將以英國所作行動、作爲判斷張伯侖首相現行政策之標準、換言之、英國若果屈服、或以妥協爲事、軸心各國概獲有鼓勵、將在歐洲賽續推行冒險舉動、即在蘇聯對於英國是否確實放棄「慕尼黑政策」一層、原已不無懷疑慮自益加增、殆可斷言」云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）日本駐英大使館秘書、昨日將抗議一件、提交英外部、反對英國報紙所載關於日軍在津封鎖新聞、該抗議內、對於日軍於實施天津英法兩租界時、脫去英人衣履事、認爲言過其實、（十七日美聯社電）</p>
<p>法大使之談話</p>

<h3 id="c3">四存學校的史績 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>中國抗戰將滿兩年，全部軍士，一般人民，戮力而使國族歷史充滿了光輝，交織而使整個幅員皆添了錦繡。其間未奉守土之命，不負殺敵之責，祗爲了匹夫匹婦的大義，不辭犧牲，不求顯揚，灑碧血，捐軀壳，立了如火如荼的功勛，演爲可歌可泣的事蹟，這類志士仁人，奇男烈女，亦不知多多少少。正氣忠魂，應受超國界的表揚與稱頌；而國家與社會的加以褒獎，允在所當然。昨天報載重慶電述河北省四存學校員生受國民政府明令褒揚，這是一例。</p>
<p>事在本年二月，地在冀南。二月十五日下午二時，有步騎砲聯合的日僞部隊，進犯四存學校所在地，（該校原設博野，抗戰以後，遷往冀（南衡水鄉間）該校員生就奮起抗戰，用步槍手溜彈與之激鬥，當斃日僞軍五六十名，並擊燬汽車三輛，日僞軍紛紛潰退。後來日軍援兵繼至，並以猛烈砲火再度進攻，激戰三四小時，四存員生因子彈告罄，無法堅守，就衝鋒突圍。一部分年齡幼小的學生，因力弱無法衝出，於是已經衝出的員生，又往返救援，直到午夜十二時半，才全部突圍而出。是役四存各員生因衆寡懸殊，器械太差，傷亡很重；但因精神激越，勇力充沛，所以擊斃日僞軍總計百餘名，竟達自身傷亡的倍數有餘，又另燬日軍汽車共五輛。這就是四存學校員生抗戰壯烈犧牲的經過大概。</p>
<p>四存學校員生的壯烈犧牲，可以說是中華民族偉大精神具體表現的一端，也就是七七以來中國英勇靑年成仁取義無數事件中的一例；然而，這事件却更有幾點値得注意的特殊意義：</p>
<p>第一，這是一件以前所僅見的靑年集團報國行動。自從七七抗戰以來，全國靑年以個人資格參加抗戰工作的不知凡幾，其中演出了驚天地泣鬼神的英勇事蹟，也不知凡幾；但是以全校員生共同奮起，荷戈衛國，作有組織的集團行動，四存學校還是創聞。這事件深切地表示了他們意識的一致，當危急臨頭的時候，決沒有人爲了個人的利害，違反了集團的意志；同時又表現了他們組織力的堅强，——而這種堅强的力量正在抗戰的過程裏成長起來，也做成了促進抗戰勝利最重要的因素。</p>
<p>第二，四存學校員生以民衆的立塲參加抗戰，不但不屈服不投降，而且採取了更積極的行動方式，解脫了自己的危境，同時更樹立了民衆抗戰最好的模範。原來四存學校員生在此大環境之下，當然自知已蹈危境，但決不逃避，決不解散，一方面武裝了自己，準備隨時一拚，一方面却依舊進行自己的學習生活，直到「最後一課」爲止。等到大難臨頭，整隊沉着應戰，雖然犧牲了一部分人的性命，但是已經使對方付出了更高的代價，同時却又已救出了大部分的員生，讓他們達到安全的境域，這種積極行動的方式，可以說是抗戰方法中最高的成就，四存員生已充分指示了這種行動的必要與可能，必然給予中國人民以無限的感奮。</p>
<p>第三，還有一點更重大的意義，那就是四存員生的壯烈犧牲，絕不是一件偶然造成的事件，而是這幾年來中國推行民族教育所得到的預期的成果。原來河北四存學校，向來是以闡述顏習齋先生學術爲職志的。顏習齋先生是明末的學者，後來雖以樸學大師的姿態出現在淸初學術界上，但是他的民族思想却非常强烈，與顧亭林先生並世同調，輝映南北。四存學校在北方是一所著名的學校，辦法和普通學校稍有不同，但對於民族精神的陶冶訓練，却非常認眞篤實。這回日偽的進攻，當然是一種有意的摧殘，然而四存員生却果然能發揮平日的素養，以實事實力來抵抗强暴，不但在民族抗戰史上發出了萬丈光芒，同時又在中國敎育的前路，指示了一個最淸楚最偉大的目標。</p>
<p>國民政府對於四存員生的褒揚，當然是必要的；然而我們以為四存員生壯烈犧牲的史實，也可以作為世界反侵略敎育的材料，在中國畸値得普遍取為法則。即在一切遭受侵略威脅的國族。亦値得以四存學校為敎育榜樣。</p>

<p>見鐵絲綱</p>
<p>已除、乃召到御鋼盔荷槍匕槍刺之東旭萊隊英兵一隊駐守局前、聞「大道」警察、並未盤踞其內、蓋晨九時英兵已令彼等退去矣、記者前往該地、見連接該局一街遠處之盡頭、有持械「大道」警察一羣、記者欲攝取其影、若輩竟舉槍欲射、乃未攝影而退、今日（十七日）午前有英官方發表文告稱、公共租界與「大道」人員、</p>

<p>幼之間，印象是深刻的，在「吃」「喝」「玩」之餘，還得想起「魔鬼」「妖怪」之類；一想起似乎可怕的很、而在此節日仿佛有恃無恐：在門前莊頭掛菖蒲劍不算、額上胸部還用雄黃寫個「王」字，這樣魔鬼·妖怪·蛇蟲什麼都得嚇死或最低限度給駭跑，這是佩流蘇吃粽子之外的工作。然而見到的祇是一些蜘蛛和蒼蠅，魔鬼·妖怪是沒有的，要「識荊」，是在鍾馗新鬼圖上，但手執利劍的大鬍子旁的鬼却格外瘦小，患着營養不良症，而且長葸非常，我於是在天眞的鑒賞之下，不禁笑了：鬼樣子如是而巳。一方面却驚異於它們的懦弱，不免有點可憐；鍾馗威風凛凛，倒有些可怕。在另外一張圖上，我感到他的滑稽：他不免手舞足蹈起來；細看之下，原來背後一個最瘦小的小鬼，在給他打傘，於是我更羡慕他的法力無邊，化腐朽為神奇；然而那時最使我佩服的還是在第三張圖上，這位英雄的出嫁妹妹，小鬼們做「勤務兵」，舉旗打傘，不算，還得給他抬妝區。</p>
<p>在現在想起來，淡然無謂的很。我如今確實看到魔鬼甚至妖怪是什麼樣子，他們一些不值得可憐，某種的「可怕」當然是更不必要了，至於「羨慕」，我祇感到羞恥，鍾馗的法力得打個七折八扣；對於它們祇有毀滅或吃掉才最適當，吾則流弊會隨之而起，豈惟呌勤務兵抬嫁妝是「徇私」而已。鍾馗或許因爲窮，祇有寶劍和破靴，然而遺憾正和「使鬼推磨」相同。「他的眞理眞是死東西」。我在這塲合有些和席勒同感。</p>
<p>丁尼生有云：「天下最沈痛的事情莫過回憶起歡欣的日子」。我眞不懂這位詩人如何要說得如此沉痛。孩子時代過節未嘗沒有歡欣，但只笑他歡欣的單純。這道並非是在現在我已感到過節耍還僓或付賬的困難。端陽除吃喝玩之外，還有社會意義，紀念三閭大夫是後來才明白的事情，不過在目前我對於這悽慘的紀念已有些淡薄，「帮忙」不得而跳黃浦（或汨羅）自然有他的孤憤，終尚欠勇敢。我之感到有豐富的社會意義的還在於「打鬼」。雲香繚繞，寶劍瀟灑，祇是端陽的儀式而已，有時還不大夠。</p>
<p>吃粽子也是儀式，但後來就變成「實惠」小孩子要肉粽勝於豆粽，分著了更歡欣，我現在仔細想起來一些也不沈痛。想着的却更有些可笑：自然，我自己的節日是不多的，似乎不大「實惠」，然而豆粽是不會拒絕的，即使不食肉；以爲頂糟的倒是嘗了奶油朱古力粽以後，祗舐舐嘴就算了。</p>
<p>我們不同於幼年時代，但愛羅先珂不聽到蛇鳴，就會喊沙漠似的寂寞呀也大可不必的；請大家看看魔鬼妖圣之形象！（義賣獻金）</p>
<h3 id="c54">雄黃酒及其他 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 天</p>
<p>小時候到了端午節，家人一定要在我的額角上，用雄黃酒寫個「王」字，或許是我的好潔，或許那酒精的味道要窒塞我的鼻子，我總是逃避這「端午的化裝」的。可是大人們的理由却是很充足，說寫寫雄黃字，可以驅鬼避邪。孩子總是怕鬼的，那末暫時讓額角受一下小難，而以後晚上聽故事，或是獨自穿過堂屋的時候，可以「百無禁忌」了。</p>
<p>後來讀「白蛇傳」，覺得「妖」雖然，修到了，知恩報恩的「義」的程度，可是一喝雄黃酒，終究還是現出丈八大蟒的原形，來。雄黃酒確是有些驅鬼避邪的功用的。</p>
<p>再後來，我不相信鬼了，即使到了毒月的五月，也不會想到寫個「王」字、或者喝一點雄黃酒</p>
<p>現在已到了中年，鬼的影子自然離我更遠，可是看看端午節的近來，忽然若有所悟，不但想起了雄黃酒有驅鬼辟邪之功，就是在門首挿幾枝葛蒲，或在室內燒點蒼朮，似乎都是含有意義的；而那位進士鍾馗先生的擒鬼而啖，想起米也是「大快人心」的。</p>
<p>這或許是我想得太離奇，想到鬼子世界中去了，可是道個世界也確是充滿了憧憧的鬼影。（義賣獻金）</p>
<h3 id="c55">端陽節與民食 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 槐靑</p>
<p>端陽節使我想起了兒童時代的生活。</p>
<p>我的故鄉是眞眞「務農爲業」的道地農家，端陽在農業上有着重大的意義，而農民們對於端陽也就格外的重視了。所以民國以來，爲了廢除舊曆，把舊曆五月初五日的端陽節改爲「夏節」，並不是沒有意義。「鄕下人種田」完全是依着四時節氣爲準則，所以舊曆又稱農曆，在農家的習慣上，廢了農曆，便不能種田，所以直到現在，農人們依舊謹奉着農曆，要他們改用「陽曆」是不可能的。</p>
<p>『三十天黃霉，端陽節開首』；稻的播種到分秧，固然有因各地風土不同而稻的種類和性質有遲早之分，但我們鄉間大都是四月中旬（當然指的是農曆）播種，五月開始分秧。分秧的日期固然有先後，但正式的開始，應該說是端陽節。黃霉時節是分秧期，黃霉正式的期限是三十天，所以有『三十天黃霉，端陽節開首』的數百年前遺傳下來的這句「老話」。</p>
<p>「下田」是農家和農夫們最最虔敬的禮節。這似乎需要解釋一下，我鄉的農事全年分稻麥兩熟，「南方人食米」，所以江南人以米爲主要農產麥僅僅是一種副產品而已。因此對於開始種稻的那天，在農家有一個最重大的禮節，這便是「下田禮」，大都是在三十天黃霉開始的端陽節舉行。那時麥早已收成，稻已長成油綠綠的秧苗，麥田的土巳經翻轉，牛或者用人力開始戽水灌田，於是開始分秧了。</p>
<p>端陽節早晨吃過了白米，豆沙，赤豆，火腿各式粽子和鷄蛋之後（這鷄蛋和粽子同煮，滋味特別芬芳），到了中午，便舉行這「下田」的隆重禮節。桌上陳列着大魚大肉酒杯大紅臘燭等，先祭「利市菩薩」，意義是保護田稻「風調雨順」，「秋收豐盛」；並保護農夫們「無災無晦」（晦是晦氣之意），「身體康健」。主人和田工依資格和長幼挨决跪拜叩首，十分虔敬，祭畢，便開始大嚼這餐一年中所難得的豐盛的筵席。至於有沒有「利市菩薩」那東西，我可不知道，不過農家對任何方面都有個「神」的信念。）</p>
<p>酒醉飯飽，農夫們掮着所有整理一新的各種農具，便開始下田了。所以端陽節也就是民食的重耍季節。</p>
<h3 id="c56">「吃」在端陽 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>歲月不居，韶光如駛，再過幾天，又是端陽佳節了。可憐這佳節，在亂離之中倏已第二度，流亡在孤島上的同胞！雖說每逢佳節倍思親，却等是有家歸不得！</p>
<p>社會風俗，過端節的行動，早巳失去憑吊忠藎爲國的屈大夫的意義了。數千年來的亮節高風，却化爲烏有，徒叨了屈大夫的光，講究吃，喝，一到端陽，第一件的吃，是五光十色的角黍，廣式粽，蘇式粽，鄞式粽……饀的花樣，更是有美皆備，無麗不臻；什麼南腿，棗泥，百菓，蓮子，赤豆，蝦仁，鷄肉，等……眞是極口腹之慾，盡餐餮之樂。第二件的吃，是筵開東閣，珍饈雜陳，什麼魚翅，海參，粉蒸肉，荷葉鷄，烤鴨，鴿蛋銀耳湯，等……眞是食前方丈，美不勝收，窮人儘管嘆「食無肉」，而富人依然是肉食豐富，那裹會體念到流亡載塗，將成餓莩的難胞！更那裹會感想到自己所處的環境！是與慘遭屠殺的</p>

<h3 id="c57">端陽節吃粽子的故事 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— 胡逢</p>
<p>近幾日來得報紙上，粽子的廣告已活躍在我們的眼前，而幾家粵式的食品公司的櫥窗裏也羅列了一匣匣的粽子，引人去購買。嗄，原來是夏曆五月初五的端陽節快到了。小朋友，你們的耳朶中想必也聽到家裹快要裹粽子了。粽子是端陽節的點綴品，這是巳成了不變的奮習慣，恰和立夏節的酒釀，中秋節的月餅，都是一個時節中的必需之物。小朋友們，可知道端陽爲什麼要吃粽子的故事嗎？據說粽子是紀念我國古代的一位大詩人——屈原。小朋友，你們可認識他嗎？我想一定有許多小朋友是對他很陌生的。</p>
<p>在我國一部很有名的歷史書「史記」上稱。屈原是春秋戰國時人，生在紀年前三百四十三年，就是離開二千一百多年以前。他的名字呌平，至於他的故鄕和家庭情况，因爲年代的久速，都無從知道了；不過只知有一個姊姊。他自幼即聰明過人，又因爲皇室貴族的關係，所以他在早年便做了官。這時天下分裂成許多小國，東征西奪，時常發生戰爭，蘇秦張儀的「合縱」「連橫」之策，在那時很爲各國國王所贊同。屆原的祖國便是楚，在長江流域的一個大國。他做了官後，懂得洽亂的方法，口才又很好，所以他具有政治上的天才，很得國王的信任，他的聲勢便更是細赫。後來被人陷害，終於降官而放逐到國外，他深恨自己命運的不幸，投身於汨羅江而死，那時他已有五十歲左右了。他的生平最偉大的貢獻，便是創造楚辭，是我國南方文學的開始，他最著名的創作「離騷」，可惜小朋友們不容易懂轉。他死的那天，正是端陽節，於是人民以粽子來紀念他。這是我國很特別的風俗，是外國所沒有的。外國的大詩人死了以後，往往立紀念碑來紀念他，而我國却以粽子來紀念古代的大詩人，恐怕使那長眠九泉之下的屈原，也會鬱鬱不樂的吧。</p>
<p>我希望小朋友們在吃粽子的時候，不要忘了我國古代的大詩人——屈原。</p>
<p>「猪」正有同樣的命運！</p>
<p>總之，「吃」在端陽是風行於中國社會的一個醉飽的季節，於上述粽，肴之外，威士忌，白蘭地，葡萄酒，花雕酒等的豪飲，汽水，啤酒，枇杷，荔枝的大嚼，酒闌，席散之後，來一杯咖啡，可可，或雨前，菊花，的餘興！眞是優哉，遊哉，樂不思蜀了。</p>
<h3 id="c58">龍舟 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>枝上的榴花紅了，池中的蒲葉綠了，在這明爽的原野上，交織着一幅調和而美麗的畫面，昭示着我們，現在已跨進夏的季節了，在夏季中的端陽，自昔被稱爲良辰佳節的，還有着不少韻事的遺留，「龍舟競渡，」也就是其中之一，一般人每喜携着俊侶，或挈着孩子們，前去觀賞，彷彿參觀什麼盛會似的，興致是十分濃厚，更不計路之遠近，舟車跋涉而前往的。</p>
<p>若考端陽鬧龍舟的初意，並不是一種應時娛樂，因爲後人遞傳相傳，而失其本意了。按荊楚歲時記載：「屈原五月五日投汨羅，故武陵以此日作競渡以招之，唐人以三月三日爲招魂節。」又唐書載：「寶曆二年三月，幸魚藻宮，觀競渡。」這不知是吾宮中借紀念屈原而作娛樂之班？但是現在的龍舟競渡，我敢說完全是遊樂性質，用來點綴端陽令節，誰更記憶及那屈大夫，（原）爲國而造成的悲慘之一頁哩，</p>
<p>龍舟競渡，在江南數省，是很風行的，若在承平之時，好事者果然逸與颷舉，鈎心鬥角的在舟上，裝點得非常美觀，以滬上的鬧龍舟來說，我猶的略憶及七八年前的某端陽，曾到滬南半淞園，去看龍舟一决，彷彿記得那决爲某公司所舉辦，是營業性質的，某公司特倩南翔名手定紮龍舟兩艘，船身一爲靑龍，一爲白龍，船上邊緣四周，紮成彩色旗傘等，五色繽紛，非常悅目，在園內的湖心亭畔，此往彼來的搖蕩着，（但不是競渡）同時船上擂鼓鳴鑼，熱鬧非凡，幷且在船首高高的立着一人，身材肥矮，手中握着一把芭蕉扇，服裝亦很別緻，上身全裸，下體著着彩色褲，隨着鑼鼓音節，手舞足蹈，片刻不停，煞是奇觀！但不知此舞蹈者是何意義，這决園內觀客，確實衆多，當時盛况，尚足回味，自此以後，滬上似乎未曾舉行過此種盛事。時到今日，國難嚴重，全國上下，爲民族爭生存，而作神聖的抗戰，更無暇再談此鬧龍舟的玩藝，抑且海上環境特殊，南市半淞名圈，聞已損毀殆盡！追懷勝跡，誠不勝今昔之感哩！</p>

<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>工部局僱專員講述故事　在小茶館學校輪流宣傳</p>
<p>一種由來已久的積習，吾則在上海的華人社會生活裹面，早已消失，但自一九二三年起，公共租界工部局僱用一位講故事的何定甫（譯音向上海的行人，從事馬路安全的宣傳之後，這積習就當做了一種新的用途。</p>
<p>那時上海的人們，才開始知道汽車是沒有牙齒的老虎，而汽車的數量，却突然的加多。因爲上海的人們，大半不防備高速力的汽車的衝撞，所以汽車一多，肇禍的案件也疾速增加。交通處的負責人員，研究肇禍的原因，才決定使行人祇准在馬路旁邊的水門泥走道上行走，而苦力的拖曳重量貨物者，也不能在主要的汽車綫上行走。</p>
<p>當初怎樣把講故事引用到安全運動上面，現在也許能够想起的人不多。但負責指導安全的人員，已知道用這種方法，對於行路安全的增進，是最有效果。祇是使人感到遺憾的，還是有猛浪的車輛在來去，而行人呢，在上海這都市疾速地現代化時，應得使自己調整，俾適於一種新的城市的生活</p>
<p>當姓何的加入交通處之後，他那時在所選定的地點講述故事時，人們對他並不生疏，因爲他在近他寓所的小茶館裹，弄堂裹面，好多年來早已爲了好講故事而爲人們認識了。</p>
<p>他擔仟新職之後，繼續去講述衝動情感的故事，使聽衆驚懼。他會講楚覇王烏江自刎的故事，使聽衆流淚；他更會講西遊記上的傳說，而使聽衆在笑；講紅樓夢的故事，而使他們心腸很軟；或是講三國志中曹操叛變的故事，而引起他們的憤怒。</p>
<p>然後到了結束，他會對聽客說：「諸君。當你跨過馬路時，一定要想到你們自己的安全。汽車是一種最危險的東西，甚至比吹翻曹操的巨艦的東風還危險、你們一定要當心。」</p>
<p>現在我們再來一看這種方法，如何進行，朱勤（譯音）是姓何的替代者，在成祈路一家小茶館裹，對着四十個人講故事。</p>
<p>「如令，各位！」他說，「你們對於魏蜀吳三國的故事，都很熟悉。蜀的軍隊有十萬之衆，由聞名四海，智謀俱備，驍男善戰的關雲長統率着，魏的首領曹操，蓄有併吞天下的雄心，由軍事顧問龐德把大兵借給他，在西綫與蜀軍作戰。龐德的勇敢，是無可指責他的，意志更是堅決，當他上戰塲作戰的時候，抬了一口棺材，說是不是關公，就是我，決不活了回去。</p>
<p>「血戰了幾天，結果變方的死傷很重，所流的血眞可成爲一條河，雙方的軍隊配備都是很好，而且是有訓練的。關雲長決定戰事的取勝，在於腦力，而不在膂力，在戰塲上面，經過一度考慮之後，便決定了一種新的戰略。</p>
<p>「第二天，他率領他的軍隊，退到漢水的邊岸一個很深的山谷下面，離前錢遠了一些。就一般的情形看來，他是敗退了，這種行動，立刻傳到龐德那邊和龐德的總部。馬上追！他就發出命令。同時關雲長又吩咐他的軍隊，再度撤退，等魏軍佔有了新據點，就用迅雷不及掩耳的手段，把離開不遠的一個水堤決穿，水灌向低地，魏軍悉數的冲入漢水。</p>
<p>「這次的大戰，不知死去了多少人，然而諸位，這種危險不但祇限於發生在戰地，你如果不注意交通規則，那你隨時有死傷的危險。在上海，各式樣的車輛，在熱鬧的馬路上行駛者很多。好多的行人，想是不會知道馬路旁邊的水門汀走道，是專爲行路者安全而設的。相反的，竟冒了死的危險，而走在車馬雜沓的馬路當中，祇要想到生命是可貴的，你會因不愼而死傷，而且就是不死，法律還要罰你不服從交通規則。」</p>
<p>交通處所僱的講故事者，自一九二五年起，增加到兩人。每天早上到各處講述故事，每人偕同捕房指定的一個華捕，照了地圖，作巡回的講述。自上海發生戰事，難民曆集之後，行人突然加多，他們更時常到難民收容所裹去講故事，宣傳行路安全。</p>
<p>但講故事的人最歡喜每决祇集合四五十人聽講，據姓朱的說，人一多，個人的接觸就不容易，而宣傳馬路安全的機會也消滅了。總之，這種方法是要使一般的聽衆都能明瞭，因爲全靠個人的趣味，使行人有安全的自覺。</p>
<p>除了茶館和難民收容所以外，講故事的人更時常到公立學校裏面去，允其是每一個學期開始之時。而且發現到年輕的學生，最能依從他們。在經騐上，更知道小學生聽到了交通規則，不但自己照規則走路，更會促使家裹的大人也這樣做。</p>
<p>這樣最初是很簡單的，現在交通處所用講故事的万法，對於馬路安全已有很好的效果。一九二六年度，統計結果，全年有五萬人聽講；一九三六年已增加到七萬人；但自一九三八年起，大批難民擠進租界，聽講的人也一躍而加到十一萬三千人，換句話說，是每星期有二千二百人聽講。</p>
<p>這種口頭的宣傳，對於行人的能够合作，减少車輛肇禍案件，究竟能發生怎樣的效果，雖然沒有確切的統計。但對於聽講的大衆，至少可使他們有馬路安全的自覺，是不可吾認的一件事。報紙上的宣傳，因爲不識字的人太多，似乎還不够。交通規則和各種法規，爲的是吾成效，也耍看每一個行人的知識程度，對於法律的認識如何，所以是同樣的不足</p>
<p>同樣的一種有效的方法，被工部局另一部分警務處所採用，自一九二六年起，警務處也僱有一個講故事的人，直到現在，輸流在每一個捕房裹面，同樣的講述故事，作馬路安全的宣傳。正和他的同僚在交通處工作而出入於茶館，收容所，學校者同樣的工作，求車輛肇禍案件的减少，和交通法規的爲行人服從。—譯自大陸報星期刊—</p>

<p>「同是天涯淪落人，相逢何必曾相識！」</p>
<p>一個是越獄亡命的獸醫，一個是孤苦無告的馬童，在一個偶然的機會中，他們親蜜地携手起來，而且指天誓日，認了父子。可是做父親的終究被探昌捕之歸案，分離了骨肉之情。這是彷佛「舐犢情深」的一個故事，坐在銀幕下的我們，深深地被這凄切的故事所感動了，而華雷斯皮萊和米蓋羅納的演技，更增添了無限的悲憤。</p>
<p>這樣簡單的一個故事，幾乎十分之八的戲又是華雷斯皮萊和米蓋羅納二人支撑着；而且是在簡陋的馬廐里，如此吃力不討好的戲而演得深刻感人，這兩位演員的演技，是值得推崇的。</p>
<p>華雷斯皮萊的爽直，粗野的作風，是和却爾斯勞頓有相似之處，就是他們都以精緻的動作來勾劃這一型人物的個性，然而這不是動作的堆積，而是刻苦地揣摩和體騐得來的。如「自由萬歲」，「舐犢情深」，他都能創造出那樣一個人物，而是十分眞實的。更且他不但創造了那樣一個人物的外形，而且是配合着豐富的情感的，如「天涯淪落」中，他在酒醉以後，和密蓋說出他從前會醫治好一匹馬，忽而又吾認，密蓋却哀求着他，於是他終於被這孩子的眼淚所感動，吩咐他上鎭去買麻醉藥。在這塲戲中，華雷斯皮萊眞演得動人極了，他的發音，動作，都流露着濃攝的倩感，這種成功，豈是幸致的？最後他混跡在馬塲中，觀看密蓋的賽馬，他包孝，呼喊，雖遇見了捕他的探員，他還是衝動地叫着，但和密蓋分別時，那種慈父的眞情，怎不使人不感動而下淚呢？</p>
<p>米蓋羅納現在是好萊塢最紅的童星，他的「孤兒樂園」是獲選十大巨片之一，以他來和華雷斯皮萊合演父子倆，又在這樣的一個故事中，眞是太好的支配。</p>
<p>但是，我們也不能忽略了導演的功續，在幾乎都是二個人支持着的戲中，他對於情感氣氛的把握都十分强固，如在馬房中醫馬；密蓋知道了德雷的旣往，恐怕賽馬時父親被捕，爲和德雷衝突；父子分手等等，都是很好的例子。而且導演者更把許多塲面處理得非常活潑風趣，不致是兩個人的戲而流於沉悶之境，如德雷講了從前醫好了一匹馬的一個故事以後；父子倆在海灘上；德雷被寡婦糾纏着等。</p>
<p>總之，「天涯淪落」是個好戲。</p>
<p>全片染淡棕色，也似乎比彩色片更明朗。</p>
<p>還值得一提的，正片前的「視覺的詩篇」Optieal　Poem，引起我們很大的興趣，它利用各種圖案的跳動，配合着音樂的節奏，再染上五彩，這該是各種短片中最動人的一個節目了。</p>

<p>第二十回　紅粉殲仇難消孽障　錄窗談愛重締良緣</p>
<p>其實袁淑文，以前也和他們在一處，知道趙樂天和潘佩英二人的愛情，已到了成熟之期。他們兩人，一定是所謂有情人成了眷屬了。後來聽得趙樂天當學生軍，打游擊戰，以及受傷進醫院，鋸去了腿子，她倒比潘佩英知道得淸楚。因爲袁淑文現在所嫁的丈夫，是當軍醫的。她聽得他們提起趙樂大，她便說道是我們的同學，有一位女同學姓潘的，就嫁了他。她滿心以爲潘佩英是已經嫁了他咧。她不但不知道潘佩英爲父親所強迫，爲回信拒絕趙樂天的事。她並且也不知道潘佩英的父親，是在偽政府裹就職的那一位呢。袁淑文是有些媽媽虎虎的，她因此今天見了潘佩英，便問起趙樂天來了。潘佩英是很細心的，仔細一想，知道她是誤會了，便道；一淑文姊，你說的那位趙樂天先生，我也好久不見了。」袁淑文聽了這話，也不覺發怔了，便道：「咦！你們兩人沒有結婚同居嗎？那末他受傷進醫院，後來從醫院裏傷愈了出來，你這個時候在那裹呢？」潘佩英不好告訴她，那時候她和趙樂犬的通信綫路，已被截斷。而且這時候，她聽了袁淑文之言，方寸已亂，到底趙樂天死還沒有死呢？便直告她道：「淑文姊！你有些誤會了，我是不曾嫁趙樂天的。所以你剛纔說要來望望我們兩位，我便覺得這話有些突兀了。」袁淑文道：「阿呀！眞的嗎？那請你恕我的冒昧了。我滿心以爲你們兩人必定成就良緣，再也沒有話說，可知天下事有出於意外的。那未你…你…袁淑文的意思就要問：你不嫁趙樂天，嫁了誰呢？潘佩英這時，却是滿腹疑雲，因想：聽她的口吻，趙樂天簡直沒有死，這話到底靠得住嗎？因問道：「有一時代，傳說趙樂天已經殉國了，說是在某一次夜顯時，陣亡了的呢。」袁淑文道：「是的呀！那時各報上都登出他的死信咧。其實只是受了傷，後來鋸斷了一條腿，漸漸兒好了。因爲我的丈夫是位醫師，雖然不是他診視的，他却知道一切。他回來講起了，我就說趙樂天是我們的同學，所以他常來告訴我他的療養經過，一直到他痊愈出醫院爲止。」（一三九）</p>

<p>却利第一决在觀衆面前顯露色相，是和埃加勃根合作的。他們到芝加哥郊外一家戲院內，做了一些小諷刺意味的表演，得到觀衆的稱許；那晚歸家途中，他們便決定永久合作，（勃根便是那中年男子，所以他和却利始終形影不離。）這表演僅得了美金五元的酬勞，委實不能謂之成功。經過了長期的奮鬬，至一九三六年夏，眞正的成功方才降臨到他們身上，從此變爲舉世知名。去年的「芙蓉仙子」和「斷鴻零雁」都是得意之作，的確不少觀衆是爲了却利而去的哩！</p>
<p>他最近新作「袍笏登場」已在本埠上映，該片女角葩葩是印度薩拉瓦的郡主，她對却利曾有一段很適當的批評，她說：「却利感我最深的便是他那偉大的性格，任何人不能及之，其决，他有了不得的口才，無論你和他講什麼，他總能給你一個聰明巧妙的回答，他衣服穿得挺漂亮，表現他對裝飾的考究，還有他的「羅曼諦克」藝術也高妙之極，不過有一件事我認爲相當討厭，埃加勃根爲什麼老是夾在旁邊呢？」（義賣獻金）</p>

<p>— （沁田）</p>
<p>勞萊哈台自一九二七年偶然在一起之後，彼此都很滿意，所以一直合作下去，那時勞萊曾經請米高梅公司允許他倆永遠合作，公司方面很是贊同，於是生產了許多精湛的滑稽影片，像「從軍樂」「學生兄弟」「玩意世界」「西遊記」都是不可多得的珍品，同時還產生多少短小精悍的趣片。</p>
<p>可是，這些笑料和劇本的編製，多半是出於瘦勞萊的手筆，所以他很傲慢，允其是對于公司方面，他覺得他的地位極重，時常地表示不滿，而且常常鬧着與哈台拆夥，同時也有威脅米高梅公司的意思。現在終於分手了，我們不能不表示惋惜。</p>
<p>他們拆夥以後，瘦勞萊以其製片人的資格，將自組影片公司，而胖哈台則與一位名呌蘭登（Harry　Langdon）的合作，這位蘭登先生的身坯，當然又只抵得過哈台一半。蘭登哈台的第一張片子是「陳娜竇的不貞」（Zemobia＇s　Infidelty），裹面講一位醫生，因爲診治一匹在馬戲塲大火時灼傷的大象，而使主顧病人們大嘩，這位醫生因此失去了生意。據說蘭登哈台將單拍長片，不拍短片，而他們的片子亦將轉變一向勞萊哈台的胡鬧作風，改爲正當的喜劇了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The British Concession in Tianjin is Blockaded: Japanese Claim it is No Longer a Local Matter, Extreme Heat Reaches 100 Degrees, Food Supply Extremely Difficult, British Man Conflicts with Puppet Police, Beaten, Injured, and Arrested <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, the British concession authorities had attempted to meet with him, but he refused all contact, believing that at this point, such meetings would be futile. The commander also stated that the current situation has escalated to a complete protest against the British pro-Chiang policy and is no longer a local dispute. He added that economic sanctions against Japan by Britain are impossible without American cooperation, and whether the US will cooperate with them is questionable. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Today is the fourth day of the British concession's blockade. The border situation remains calm, with many Chinese citizens patiently waiting to be allowed into the concession. It is estimated that only about two hundred Chinese are allowed into the concession per entry point each day. According to those who were allowed in, some farmers carrying products had been waiting since last night to enter the concession, but left disappointed. A Reuters reporter inspected the vegetable market today and found most stalls empty. The few vegetables available were of poor quality. Only a small amount of mutton remained in the butcher shops, and it was not very fresh. Fifty pounds of fresh fish were for sale, but much had spoiled due to lack of ice. While leaving the concession is not difficult for Chinese citizens, entering the Japanese concession is made difficult. However, few seem to want to take this opportunity to leave the blockaded area, which is a curious phenomenon. The newly constructed road connecting the First Special District with the Chinese area, usually deserted, is now bustling with pedestrians and vehicles, forming a lively street. According to the most reliable sources, Yokohama Specie Bank has informed German trading companies engaged in overseas trade that the bank is willing to do business with them, provided they establish offices outside the concession and guarantee that imported goods will not be unloaded within the concession. It is rumored that at least one German company has accepted these conditions and plans to set up an office in the Chinese area. The Pingjin Times editorial stated that the Tianjin incident is no longer a local affair. The reason the British and French are taking such a firm stance is because they recognize this point and know that what they are doing has far-reaching implications, not limited to just one corner. Canadian photographer Mayer, released yesterday, stated today that he was treated reasonably well. He was detained for some time for taking moving pictures around the British concession. The films were confiscated, but the camera was returned. He signed four copies of a statement dictated by the Japanese, which read: "Yesterday at 1 o'clock, I was taking pictures at Wan Guo Bridge. I filmed the Japanese soldiers' search station. This is very detrimental to Japanese secrets. I cannot defend what I did. I am very sorry and ask for forgiveness. In the future, I will obtain appropriate permission for everything." (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Foreign news: A British employee of the Beining Railway, Smith, got into a dispute with puppet police at the exit of the British concession on the 17th, resulting in him being beaten, injured, and arrested. The British Consul is negotiating with the Japanese for his release. In addition, the anti-British propaganda campaign is intensifying, with anti-British slogans plastered on all major thoroughfares in the Japanese-occupied areas, and various slogans broadcast via radio and leaflets distributed by balloons. There are also agitators openly holding gatherings in the streets. (17th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Today, a puppet Chinese policeman in the First Special District struck a British man on the head with a pistol, causing injury. This man, named Smith, had just walked out of a coffee shop on Wilson Street when he clashed with a Chinese policeman from the Tianjin puppet municipal government. Smith, not wanting to argue, continued walking, but the policeman drew his pistol and followed him. Near the intersection of Wuxi Road and the British concession, he knocked the British man down. The cause of the conflict is unknown. Smith's head was struck by the policeman's pistol, and he lost consciousness. Although he was taken to a hospital in the First Special District for treatment, the British side has negotiated with the Japanese on how to transfer him to a hospital in the British concession for treatment. However, so far, not only has the negotiation failed, but Smith has also been detained in the police station of the First Special District. (17th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) As the Japanese blockade intensifies, the food situation in the British concession worsens. No supplies are currently entering the concession, as the Japanese patrol the river opposite the former German concession with motorboats, preventing ships carrying vegetables from approaching the border, and have implemented a strict plan around the southern border of the concession to cut off supplies. Currently, only a small amount of vegetables and meat are available. The temperature is very high, reaching around 100 degrees Fahrenheit. In this extreme heat, the lack of water is particularly distressing. Although the British generally do not step out of the concession, some are forced to go outside for work. One gentleman, a respectable British man, was at the end of a long line of Chinese people. Although he showed his pass, the Japanese ignored him twice. Later, a Chinese policeman urged him forward, but he was eventually stopped by a Japanese soldier. The Japanese soldier insisted that several Chinese people behind him go first before allowing him to pass. Several Russian members of the local anti-communist committee were also inspected yesterday, stripped of their clothes, and released into the former German concession. What is strange is that the initiators and organizers of this anti-communist committee are all Japanese, and the Russian members who were strip-searched all held special passes. Although the Japanese mass parade to the graves of Japanese soldiers who died in the Boxer Rebellion has now been cancelled, which is a relief, the situation remains serious. An important British expatriate told a Reuters reporter that the focus of the situation will be on the sense of responsibility and unity of the public front. It is now widely believed that Tianjin is a test case, and people in Tianjin have long known that the success or failure of the Tianjin case is tied to the success or failure of Japan's plan to control the economy and politics of North China. Moreover, Japan wants to use this to test the degree to which the expansion of Japanese power elsewhere in China will be tolerated. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Second Deputy Commissioner of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, Lozovsky, lodged an oral protest with the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Shigenori Togo, regarding the occupation of the Soviet consulate in Tianjin by Japanese troops. Ambassador Togo immediately replied that he was unaware of the matter and could not accept the protest. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Warships Escorting Food Denied by British Side</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese claim that the food in the concessions here is now mostly escorted by British warships. This claim has now been denied by the British side here. According to the British authorities, British warships are currently not in Tianjin. For example, the gunboat "Medea" is currently in Qinhuangdao, the "Eagle" is an aircraft carrier, and the Medway is a submarine depot ship. As for several submarines, they are mostly in Weihaiwei. Regarding the Japanese side's request to the British Consul in Tianjin to remove the blockade, this has also been officially denied by the British side. The Japanese mass gathering today to pay respects at the graves of those who died in the Boxer Rebellion has now been cancelled, and instead, 50 representatives from the Japanese Consulate, the army and navy, Boy Scouts, and veterans will go to lay flowers. As for the customs office originally in the French concession, it has now decided to establish a temporary office in the First Special District. (Associated Press, 17th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) A British naval spokesman recently declared that the rumors that several British warships have loaded food and sailed to Tianjin are without factual basis. He added that the British warship "Dido" is still docked in Qinhuangdao, while the British warships "Eagle," "Medway," and several submarines are docked in the port of Weihaiwei. None of these ships have received orders to sail to Tianjin. (Associated Press Urgent Dispatch, 1:00 PM, 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">British Officials Advocating Economic Retaliation Against Japan, Representatives from Various Departments Consult on Report, Preparing to Submit to Cabinet for Discussion, Three Possible Paths Available <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(London) Today, officials here expressed their opinion that if the situation in Tianjin does not improve by the end of this week, the British government will have three possible courses of action:</p>
<p>Remove Japan from the list of most-favored nations. Repeal the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of 1911 and exclude Japan from major markets in Britain and its colonies. Impose heavy taxes on Japanese goods. It is widely believed that this plan would further severely impact Japan's economic position, which has already been affected by the costly two-year war. A statement on the current situation will be delivered in the House of Commons on Monday. Staff from the Department of Commerce, the Treasury, and the Foreign Office have been studying various ways to deal with the situation over the past three days and are drafting their recommendations in the form of a report. If the situation does not improve by the end of this week, the government may adopt several plans, including the above-mentioned methods. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Tianjin incident, cabinet members are currently awaiting a report from Chamberlain. Chamberlain left London last night to spend the weekend in Gust, but remains in close contact with the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street. While those close to the Foreign Office here hope that the Japanese government will change its mind and negotiate with Britain to find a solution, they say that if necessary, Britain will definitely take retaliatory measures. The manner in which this will be done has been studied by officials from the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and Foreign Affairs over the past three days, and a report has been prepared for submission to the Cabinet for discussion. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) According to sources in London's diplomatic circles last night, regarding the Japanese blockade of the British concession in Tianjin and the Gulangyu incident, the British government has decided to take economic retaliation against Japan. It is said that the content of this economic retaliation policy will be decided at an extraordinary meeting of the British Cabinet next Monday. At the same time, the British Foreign Office is still in close contact with France and the United States. Officials here are extremely angry at the Japanese side's constant humiliation of British expatriates. According to them, the Japanese side's aim is to change the British side's policy towards the Far East and the relationship between China and Britain. According to a semi-official British statement, if the Japanese side continues to force the British side to accept new conditions, it will cause an extremely serious situation, forcing the British government to consider taking immediate and effective steps to protect British interests in China. It is generally believed that this semi-official statement is a last-minute suggestion from Britain to Japan. The government believes that the hope for the Japanese side to reopen negotiations with Britain is very slim, as the Japanese side's negotiation principles are likely still unacceptable to the British government. Furthermore, according to the statement yesterday, "The British side attaches great importance to Japan's further demands, as these demands will affect the rights and interests of all powers in China." Regarding the threats issued recently by Japanese spokesmen in Tianjin, the statement added, "From this perspective, the Japanese blockade of the British concession is definitely not due to the British refusal to extradite the four Chinese." The statement continued, regarding the British attempt to resolve the dispute as a local incident, the British government deeply hopes that the Japanese side will reconsider. Since last night, British officials have generally advocated taking economic retaliation against Japan, and experts from the Department of Commerce have submitted an economic retaliation plan to the Cabinet for review and approval. Furthermore, the British Cabinet is suspected of convening a conference of the nine-power treaty countries (including the United States) to consider the Far East issue. (Associated Press, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet is scheduled to hold a meeting on the 19th of this month to continue discussing the situation in Tianjin. If Japan's attitude remains stubborn, the Cabinet is likely to decide to declare the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Agreement of 1911 null and void. Those close to the government here recently said that if the Japanese government has not formally stated its position, it is still hoped that it will agree to treat the case as a local incident and accept the fair suggestions made by the British side to seek a solution, so as to avoid the current dispute from escalating, which would be best. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>British Press Opinion Agrees with Retaliatory Measures</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Japanese military's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, the semi-official statement issued by responsible parties here yesterday has been commented on by various newspapers. The Times reported: "The British government's attitude is very clear. In short, on the issue of extraditing the four Chinese, it still advocates organizing a joint committee. Whatever recommendations this committee makes should be implemented, even if it is contrary to British will. Conversely, if the Japanese authorities in Tianjin stubbornly adhere to their views and continue to implement their high-pressure tactics, then Britain is forced to take retaliatory measures." The Daily Mail's tone is even harsher, stating, "Japan must be taught a lesson." It also said, "There are several questions that must be asked frankly. In short, what do the Japanese consider us to be? What do they consider other countries that do business in the Far East to be? In short, we want to restore Japan's sanity, and there are many other methods besides using force." (Havas, 17th) The Financial Times recently published an editorial on the Tianjin incident in China, stating: "Japan is now seeking to establish a precedent, the impact of which is that (British commerce will be excluded from China, which is undoubtedly clear from the statements made by Japanese spokesmen). In addition, there is another point that makes the current situation even more serious, that is, other countries will use the actions taken by Britain as a standard for judging Prime Minister Chamberlain's current policy. In other words, if Britain succumbs or compromises, the Axis powers will be encouraged to continue to carry out adventurous actions in Europe. Even the Soviet Union's doubts about whether Britain has truly abandoned its 'Munich policy' will only increase, which can be asserted." (Havas, 16th) Havas Cable)</p>
<p>(London) The secretary of the Japanese Embassy in Britain submitted a protest to the British Foreign Office yesterday, objecting to the news reports in British newspapers about the Japanese military's blockade in Tianjin. In the protest, the stripping of British citizens' clothing by the Japanese military during the implementation of the blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin was considered an exaggeration. (Associated Press, 17th)</p>
<p>The French Ambassador's Remarks</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to the French Ambassador to China, Cosme, in an interview with the Associated Press today, the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin concession and the conditions proposed by the Japanese are not as serious as generally imagined. The current danger is that, with the slightest carelessness, a precedent will be created for the Japanese to cite for insatiable demands. For example, after handing over the four suspected terrorists to the Japanese, it will become a custom, and the Japanese can arbitrarily demand extradition in all similar cases in the future. Cosme also said that third countries must devise a way to fully guarantee the neutrality of the concessions. As for the so-called terrorists, if they are tried by the Chinese court in the concession, the punishment will be light, but if they are interrogated by the Japanese or by their puppet organization, they will surely be sentenced to death. Therefore, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and other countries, due to the needs of the times, must devise a proper method that can ensure justice and at the same time ensure the neutrality of the concessions. If dealing with anti-Japanese elements, they must be made to believe that if an incident occurs, they will be punished without leniency, and then they can be suppressed and controlled. At this point, Cosme suggested establishing an international court of justice to resolve such issues. Cosme said that he believes the current difficulties can be resolved gradually. Cosme then laughed and told reporters that the Japanese have always been extremely difficult to deal with. What the Japanese dislike most is holding meetings to negotiate and calmly discuss a way to make mutual concessions. When asked about the Japanese's new plans, Cosme replied that what the Japanese want is peace and the establishment of a "new government." During this period, we must pay close attention to the important developments in the situation. As for the government, the Japanese seem to be making Wang Jingwei the head of the "North China Government," and then divide China into two parts, one controlled by the Chongqing government and the other controlled by Peiping. Cosme also said, "I am sure that no matter what plans the Japanese implement, the Chinese government will continue to fight. What is difficult to predict is what changes will occur in this area and in the areas controlled by the Japanese in the future." He also said that the "new government" that the Japanese want to establish may include Central China and South China, but "I do not believe the Japanese can conquer the land and people between Guangdong and North China. The anti-Japanese sentiment of the Chinese people is too strong. No matter how the Japanese propagandize, it is difficult to numb them." When the French ambassador spoke of Wang Jingwei, he claimed that his propaganda was purely targeted at bankers and financiers in Shanghai, with the aim of making them believe in the ineffectiveness of continuing the war of resistance. At the same time, he wanted to use Chinese capital to develop the Japanese-occupied areas, but Wang Jingwei's propaganda will definitely not shake the ordinary people whose anti-Japanese sentiment is extremely high.

<h3 id="e3">The Historical Achievements of the Si Cun School <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>As China's war of resistance approaches its second anniversary, all soldiers and the general populace have worked tirelessly to fill the nation's history with brilliance, weaving together a tapestry that adds splendor to the entire territory. Among them, those who have not received the mandate to defend their land or bear the responsibility of killing the enemy, but who, for the sake of the great righteousness of ordinary men and women, have sacrificed themselves without seeking fame, shedding their blood and giving up their lives, have established glorious achievements and performed moving deeds. The number of these patriots, righteous men, extraordinary men, and heroic women is unknown. Their righteous spirit and loyal souls should be praised and commended beyond national boundaries, and the state and society should certainly commend them. Yesterday's report in the Chongqing news stated that the members and students of the Si Cun School in Hebei Province were commended by order of the National Government, which is one example.</p>
<p>The event took place in February of this year in southern Hebei. At 2:00 PM on February 15, a joint Japanese-puppet force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery invaded the location of the Si Cun School (the school was originally located in Boye, but after the war of resistance, it moved to the countryside of Hengshui in southern Hebei). The members and students of the school rose up in resistance, fighting fiercely with rifles and hand grenades. They killed five or sixty Japanese-puppet troops, destroyed three cars, and the Japanese-puppet troops retreated in disarray. Later, Japanese reinforcements arrived and launched another attack with intense artillery fire. After three or four hours of fierce fighting, the Si Cun members and students, having run out of ammunition, were unable to hold their ground and charged to break through the encirclement. Some of the younger students were unable to break through due to their weakness, so the members and students who had already broken through went back to rescue them, and finally broke through the encirclement completely at 12:30 AM. In this battle, the Si Cun members and students suffered heavy casualties due to the disparity in numbers and the inferiority of their equipment, but due to their passionate spirit and abundant courage, they killed more than a hundred Japanese-puppet troops in total, which was more than double their own casualties, and also destroyed a total of five Japanese cars. This is the general account of the heroic sacrifice of the Si Cun School members and students in the war of resistance.</p>
<p>The heroic sacrifice of the Si Cun School members and students can be said to be a concrete manifestation of the great spirit of the Chinese nation, and it is also one example of the countless incidents since the July 7th Incident in which China's heroic youth have achieved benevolence and righteousness. However, this incident has several special meanings that deserve attention:</p>
<p>First, this is an unprecedented act of national service by a youth group. Since the July 7th War of Resistance, countless young people across the country have participated in the war of resistance in their individual capacities, and countless heroic deeds that shook the heavens and moved the earth have been performed among them. However, the Si Cun School is the first to hear of the entire school's members and students jointly rising up, taking up arms to defend the country, and taking organized group action. This incident deeply shows the consistency of their consciousness. When danger comes, no one violates the will of the group for the sake of personal gain. At the same time, it also demonstrates the strength of their organizational power, and this strong force is growing in the process of the war of resistance and has become the most important factor in promoting the victory of the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Second, the Si Cun School members and students participated in the war of resistance from the standpoint of the people. Not only did they not submit or surrender, but they also adopted a more active mode of action, extricated themselves from their dangerous situation, and at the same time set the best example of popular resistance. Originally, the Si Cun School members and students, under this large environment, certainly knew that they had entered a dangerous situation, but they never evaded, never disbanded. On the one hand, they armed themselves and prepared to fight at any time, and on the other hand, they still carried out their own learning life until the "last lesson." When disaster struck, the entire team calmly responded to the battle. Although the lives of some people were sacrificed, the other side had paid a higher price, and at the same time, most of the members and students had been rescued, allowing them to reach a safe area. This active mode of action can be said to be the highest achievement in the war of resistance method. The Si Cun members and students have fully indicated the necessity and possibility of this action and will inevitably give the Chinese people unlimited inspiration.</p>
<p>Third, there is an even greater significance, that is, the heroic sacrifice of the Si Cun members and students is by no means an accidental event, but the expected result of China's promotion of national education in recent years. Originally, the Hebei Si Cun School has always been committed to expounding the academics of Mr. Yan Xizhai. Mr. Yan Xizhai was a scholar at the end of the Ming Dynasty. Although he later appeared in the academic circles of the early Qing Dynasty as a master of practical learning, his national thinking was very strong, and he resonated with Mr. Gu Tinglin, shining brightly in the north and south. The Si Cun School is a famous school in the north. The methods are slightly different from ordinary schools, but it is very serious and earnest in cultivating and training national spirit. This time, the invasion of the Japanese puppets was certainly an intentional destruction, but the Si Cun members and students were indeed able to give full play to their usual qualities and use practical strength to resist tyranny. Not only did it emit a brilliant light in the history of the national war of resistance, but it also indicated a most clear and greatest goal on the road of education in China.</p>
<p>The National Government's commendation of the Si Cun members and students is certainly necessary. However, we believe that the heroic sacrificial history of the Si Cun members and students can also be used as anti-aggression educational materials for the world. It is universally valued and adopted as a rule in China. Even in all nations threatened by aggression, it is also worth taking the Si Cun School as an educational example.</p>
<h3 id="e4">U.S. Government Expresses Deep Concern Regarding the Situation in the Tianjin Concession; Hull Tells Reporters He Will Decide on a Course of Action After Receiving Detailed Reports; American Newspapers Generally Advocate for Strong Action <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Secretary of State Hull, while meeting with reporters today, stated that foreigners in Tianjin are beginning to feel the pain of the blockade. Hull released a telegram from the U.S. Consul General in Tianjin, Caldwell, stating that supplies such as milk and vegetables are becoming scarce. Hull continued that the Chargé d'affaires in Japan, Tavenner, has expressed concern to the Japanese government regarding this situation. He is now awaiting detailed reports from the U.S. ambassadors in China and Japan before deciding on a course of action. Meanwhile, the U.S. Consul in Amoy (Xiamen), McNutt, has also reported to the State Department that the Japanese are blockading the Kulangsu (Gulangyu) International Settlement and cutting off its food supply. Although the situation is not yet severe due to ample food reserves, it will eventually become serious, Hull added. Hull also stated that, according to the report from the U.S. Consul General in Tianjin, Caldwell, there have been no reports of Americans or American goods encountering significant difficulties or interference. A reporter asked about the British claim that the United States had agreed to appoint someone to join the Tianjin Mediation Committee. Hull replied that he had no new information to offer. A reporter asked Hull to comment on the British claim that accepting Japanese demands would be tantamount to abandoning the policy traditionally adopted by the British government, and shared by all countries concerned in the Far East, under the threat of force. Hull replied that the State Department is very concerned about various important aspects of the situation and is awaiting its development in order to formulate an opinion. (Reuter, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The situation in Tianjin, China, has recently been commented on by experienced observers. While the State Department's policy toward Chinese affairs is firm, it is also flexible. This is intended for two purposes: (1) to avoid pushing Japan into forming an alliance with Germany and Italy; and (2) to encourage moderate elements within Japan who oppose an alliance with Germany and Italy, and to avoid striking a blow against them. However, if the Japanese government disregards everything and continues to follow Germany's lead, the U.S. government will likely gain public support to impose retaliatory measures on Japan. The New Neutrality Act proposed by the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Bloom (which has been reviewed and passed by the Foreign Affairs Committee and will soon be submitted to the House for discussion), would also be more likely to pass. President Roosevelt recently sent a cruiser to transport the ashes of the deceased Japanese Ambassador Saito back to Japan to express goodwill. Not long after, he ordered the majority of the fleet to return from the Atlantic to the Pacific. This is of great significance, as it aims to urge Japan to pursue a moderate policy. Regarding the Tianjin incident, the State Department has not received any information that would justify lodging a formal protest with Japan. However, it is observing the development of the situation with great attention to determine whether the Japanese government intends to exclude the United States and other signatory nations of the Nine-Power Treaty from China in order to respond accordingly. The U.S. Chargé d'affaires in Japan, Grew (sic, should be Tavenner), has expressed to the Japanese government the hope that the Japanese military authorities will respect the lives, safety, and property of American citizens. Apart from this, the United States has not taken any diplomatic action. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(New York) The Japanese military's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, has recently been commented on by various newspapers here. The Republican New York Herald Tribune stated, "This action by the Japanese military constitutes an act of war. It is the duty of the U.S. government to inform the Japanese government that all actions taken by that country against foreign nationals in Kulangsu and Tianjin by force are measures of a warlike nature. Any country that takes such warlike actions against the United States cannot maintain friendly relations with it in diplomatic and commercial terms." The Democratic New York Times stated, "The New Order in East Asia advocated by Japan means complete control of China. Britain cannot cooperate with this at all. If Britain were to yield to it, not only would the interests it and other countries hold in China be greatly affected, but also the prestige it holds in other parts of Asia would be severely undermined. In short, if Britain continues to pursue a soft policy after the Munich Agreement, it will inevitably cause serious consequences in India. Japan will also be encouraged to go beyond controlling the concessions, further intensifying its oppression, attempting to destroy all other legitimate interests of various countries, monopolize the Chinese market, and close the doors of trade to Western countries. This crisis should be prevented as early as possible. As for the United States, the Tianjin incident is indeed related to its substantial and direct interests." Other newspapers stated that Japan's attempt to force European and American countries to completely withdraw from China can be seen in the recent statement made by a spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Republican Washington Post recently published an editorial on the situation in Tianjin, China, stating that the United States cannot ignore it and that the majority of Americans support the government taking active measures. "The problems that have arisen in North China are enough to affect the future of foreigners in China. Regarding the Tianjin incident, if Britain and France are forced to yield and accept Japanese demands as the price for ending the blockade, it will create a precedent of particularly great significance. What is the significance? That the orders issued by Japan will have legal effect throughout the Far East. Foreigners must obtain Japan's tolerance in order to reside in China and conduct business. Is this tolerable? Japan's repeated actions of hindering the legitimate rights and interests of foreigners are already unjustified, let alone allowing this to happen. Therefore, all signatory nations of the various treaties related to the Far East must take responsibility and resist." In short, in the past two years, the confrontation between the United States and Japan has been increasing, while sympathy for China has been growing. "Up to this point, Americans seem to believe that the current situation is such that the United States must take action." (Havas, 16th)</p>

<p>Successive Recapture of Strongholds Near Nanlinqiao.</p>
<p>Pingjiang. Fierce fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops has been raging for days near Nanlinqiao, an important stronghold on the northern section of the Hunan-Hubei Highway. After the Japanese troops from Nanlinqiao broke through to the east, Chinese troops immediately launched a two-pronged counterattack starting on the 11th: one route advanced westward along the highway from Tongshan, and the other route attacked northwards across the mountains from near Jiumen. By the 14th, Chinese troops had occupied the strongholds of Tangpingpu, Huanghuayan, and Tongpenling, one kilometer southeast and south of Nanlinqiao, killing 400-500 Japanese troops and capturing a Japanese artillery mount. From the 14th to the 17th, in addition to closely monitoring the Japanese troops at Nanlinqiao, Chinese troops dispatched strong units to attack the highways leading from Nanlinqiao to Chongyang and Xianning, cutting off their retreat routes. The attacking units on the Nan-Chong road occupied Baiyangpu and Lukou, while those on the Nan-Cheng road advanced to Shimen. With each of the highways cut off by the Chinese army, Japanese troops were unable to reinforce Nanlinqiao. The Japanese troops trapped in Nanlinqiao are showing signs of wavering.

<p>Suzhou correspondence. The Longshou Mountain House on the lower section of the Shantang Cai in Suzhou houses a complete copy of the Avatamsaka Sutra, written in blood by a high monk of the Yuan Dynasty. It is usually stored in a separate stone niche. The writing on the sutra is pale yellow due to its age. It is a famous ancient artifact of the Wu region, recorded in local chronicles. Famous figures of the Ming and Qing dynasties, such as Weng Tonghe, all wrote postscripts. In recent times, Kang Youwei and Chen Sanli all wrote poems, numbering no less than hundreds. This sutra is not only related to the cultural heritage of the Wu region, but also qualifies as a national treasure. Since the fall of Suzhou, the Longshou Mountain House has fortunately remained intact. Recently, this sutra suddenly went missing. According to the abbot, it was stolen. From now on, Chinese ancient artifacts will suffer another loss.</p>

<p>(Washington) According to statistics released today by the Department of Commerce, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has shipped gold worth 400 million U.S. dollars to the United States to purchase military supplies. International financial experts observe that after such a large outflow of Japanese gold, the amount of gold remaining within the country must be very limited. Although there are no official figures available regarding the amount of gold currently held in Japan, international financiers believe that Japan's remaining gold reserves do not exceed 100 million U.S. dollars. Therefore, if Japan's gold continues to flow out, Japan's ability to purchase foreign goods will be severely hampered. The main reason for Japan's large gold outflow is the trade deficit. In 1937 (excluding "Manchukuo," Dalian, and North China), Japan's trade deficit reached 300 million U.S. dollars. Last year, this deficit increased to 525 million U.S. dollars. It is predicted that Japan's gold losses will be even greater in 1939. (Associated Press, 17th)</p>

The best course of action is to build a military port in Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam, to serve as a base for the French Far East Fleet. Colonial Minister Mandel is carefully planning this matter. The conference then passed a resolution containing three main points: (1) to adopt a tough stance to protect France's rights in the Far East, especially in the French Concession and the International Settlement in Shanghai; (2) if Japan causes further disputes, England and France should prohibit Japanese ships from using their ports in the Far East as retaliation; and (3) to support the proposal to build a naval base in Cam Ranh Bay.

<p>Yulin. When Shawan was in Chongqing, the Japanese side encouraged De Wang to steal the mausoleum of Genghis Khan. He made a special proposal to the Central Government to escort the mausoleum to ensure its safety. The Central Government granted his request, and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Military Affairs Commission appointed Chu Mingshan and Tang Jingran as special commissioners for the relocation. At the same time, Deng Baoshan, Gao Shuangcheng, He Zhuguo, and Shi Hua were telegraphed to personally pay their respects at Ikh Khorig before the relocation. On the 9th of this month, Mongolian and Han officials such as Shawan, Deng Baoshan, Gao Shuangcheng, He Zhuguo, Shi Hua, Yan Rongxiang, Yuan Qingzeng (representative of Chuan Zuoyi), Bai Haifeng, Chu Mingshan, Tang Jingran, and Sheng Yuqia paid their respects to the mausoleum of Genghis Khan and his sword in Ikh Khorig. After the ceremony, the relocation began. Shawan was originally the chief sacrificial officer of the mausoleum, but due to Ji Nong's recent busyness, Ji Nong's position was taken over by Tu Wang. The relocation of the mausoleum is a major event in three hundred years. Darhat Mongols guarding the mausoleum, follow the procession, Ji Nong appointed Gong Zhizhabu as the mausoleum protection commissioner. After the success of the War of Resistance, the mausoleum will be moved back to Ikh Khorig, The Darhat Mongols who guard the mausoleum, the Central Government will make other preferential arrangements, and continue to guard the mausoleum.</p>
<p>(Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Yulin. On the 15th, the mausoleum of Genghis Khan passed through Yulin and headed south. The mausoleum entered through the north gate, passed through the city, did not stop, and exited through the south gate. The entire city of Yulin hung flags. Civil servants, soldiers, students, and merchants lined up outside the city for several miles to welcome it. Those lining up to welcome it inside the city stood solemnly on both sides of the thoroughfare. When the procession escorting the mausoleum arrived, the entire city set off firecrackers, the sound shaking the roofs, extremely enthusiastic. The procession escorting the mausoleum was arranged as follows: Chen Yuqia led the cavalry in front, followed by monks and musicians. Darhat Mongols, including the musician Ya Mutat, rode horses in formation behind the monks. One of the Darhat Mongols rode a horse, holding Genghis Khan's sword, namely Sudingzhongda of Sudinghuoluo, guarded by the Darhat Mongols. The Darhat Mongols wore Mongolian costumes, gauze hats, and round-necked robes, contrasting vividly with the surrounding sand dunes. Behind the Darhat Mongol cavalry followed the mausoleum of Genghis Khan and his empresses. The mausoleum of Genghis Khan in Ikh Khorig originally consisted of two huge Mongolian yurts combined, one of which contained a silver coffin with the Khan's remains. The silver coffin is now wrapped in red and yellow silk and pulled by two mules. There are a total of three coffins of the Khan and his empresses, all in the shape of boxes.

<p>Ministry of Finance Decides to Maintain Creditworthiness; The Seventh Installment of Principal and Interest on Unified Public Bonds to be Paid on July 31st</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Ministry of Finance is striving to maintain the creditworthiness of public bonds. For all unified, reconstruction and gold long-term bonds guaranteed by customs revenue, the MOF is still allocating funds for payments. This has already won the trust of the bondholders. It has been decided that the seventh installment of principal and interest on the Unified Public Bonds, due on July 31st, will be fully paid. However, in order to prevent a large amount of legal tender from flowing into the occupied areas, certain restrictions will be implemented. The total amount payable for principal and interest is 56,600,300 yuan. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Reports indicate that although the Reconstruction Gold Bonds are secured by customs revenues, the Ministry of Finance will still pay interest as usual. It is rumored that the seventh installment of interest will be paid on July 31st. However, in order to prevent a large amount of legal tender from flowing into the occupied areas, payment will be made in Chongqing. Payment in Shanghai will be in the form of "remittance permits." It is rumored that the amount payable at the end of July is 56,603,500 yuan. (Reuter, 17th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Foreign Commissar Molotov, British Envoy Strang, British Ambassador Seeds, and French Ambassador Naggiar met at the Kremlin this afternoon for one hour and fifteen minutes. Strang then met with the two ambassadors again at the British Embassy. Afterward, Strang stated that consultations would likely continue tomorrow. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the British and French governments will continue to maintain contact this week to coordinate their efforts and ensure the swift completion of the current negotiations. Political figures here say that although Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov has adopted a reserved attitude towards the new plan proposed by Britain and France, this does not mean that the negotiation situation is unfavorable. The British and French plans were initially not intended to be immutable, and the goal of the current negotiations is to modify them in a way that satisfies all three countries: Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. However, parliamentarians are quite anxious about the slow progress of the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, given the tense relations between Britain and Japan, and the ongoing commercial negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union, which may involve issues beyond commerce. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources here claim that although the various difficulties concerning the issue of guarantees for the Baltic states have not been completely resolved, the future is promising, and the establishment of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is expected soon. However, one point worth noting is that the issue of extending the scope of the British-French-Soviet agreement to the Far East has not yet been discussed. If relations between Britain and Japan become more strained, the situation may change, and it is not certain. Some members of the Conservative Party, who originally opposed any agreement with the Bolsheviks, have changed their attitude due to Japan's blockade of the British concession in Tianjin. At the same time, political figures criticized the Soviet TASS news agency's announcement that "the Soviet Union is still not entirely satisfied with the new proposals from Britain and France," saying that the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have made considerable progress. For example, some key issues, such as (1) prohibiting separate peace treaties in wartime and (2) holding staff talks immediately, have been resolved. The only issue that remains to be resolved is the guarantee of the Baltic states. In addition, French Ambassador to the Soviet Union Naggiar has made commendable efforts to reconcile the views of Britain and the Soviet Union in the initial negotiations. Molotov has now understood the views of Britain and France, and it is expected that after several more negotiations, all difficulties will be resolved. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German government is paying close attention to the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union for a mutual assistance agreement. Given the many difficulties in the current negotiations among these countries, Germany is again openly considering the possibility of approaching the Soviet Union. Ambassador Schulenburg to the Soviet Union and Commercial Counselor Hegenai recently returned home to report to the government on the situation in the Soviet Union. Ambassador Schulenburg also reported on his recent talks with Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov. In addition, many German industrialists are organizing a committee here, which is expected to send a delegation to the Soviet Union in the near future to study the issue of developing bilateral trade. Political figures have also hinted that the contact between Germany and the Soviet Union may not be limited to economic issues. In this situation, although Germany has declared that if the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is indeed established, then Italy and Germany should enhance the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan as a response, in reality, the German government may not be willing to improve relations with Japan to avoid hindering the possibility of an approach between Germany and the Soviet Union. In addition, the economic weekly "Wirtschaftswoche" published an article titled "The Crisis in Poland," stating that Britain's current policy is to place Poland under Soviet control, so that the Soviet Union can become a direct neighbor of Germany. The Soviet Union seems to want to use this new proximity to pursue other plans, namely, to establish a relationship of consultation with Germany, which is greatly different from what Britain initially intended. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: According to the "Warsaw Daily," after British envoy Strang held two talks with Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov, opinions within the Soviet government were divided into two factions. One faction, including Molotov, Zhdanov, and Andreev, advocated close cooperation with Western countries. The other faction, including Voroshilov, Kaganovich, and Gangaganovich, insisted that the Soviet Union should disengage from capitalist countries. Stalin has not yet expressed his opinion. (Haitong, 17th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the talks taking place in Moscow among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the semi-official German News Agency (DNB) recently issued a report from London claiming that the sticking point in the negotiations is not the issue of guarantees for the Baltic states, but the Far East. Britain is already prepared to provide guarantees for the Baltic states. However, the Soviet Union is now also demanding that if it becomes involved in a conflict with Japan due to fulfilling its mutual assistance obligations, Britain must also provide assistance. Britain is only willing to offer verbal promises but is unwilling to explicitly stipulate this in the treaty. Strang, head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, was dispatched to Moscow to provide various assurances to the Soviet leaders, but Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov insists that Britain must accept written commitments. The British government is hesitant because it fears that such provisions will have an impact in the Far East, making Britain subject to Soviet control. Foreign observers here are surprised by this report from the German News Agency. (Havas, 16th)</p>

<p>(London) According to the "Victoire" newspaper, France is once again raising the old proposal to build an underwater tunnel under the English Channel due to military needs. According to the newspaper, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies is now considering a proposal from a deputy from the Lorraine region, requesting that negotiations be initiated with the British government to implement the plan. The cost is estimated at 40 to 50 billion francs. Proponents of the tunnel claim that after its completion, Britain can send a large number of troops and transport a large amount of military supplies to aid France without transportation difficulties, and can also obtain a safe line of communication for supplies and food.

<p>Rock Island, Illinois, USA: The US Army armory here has stepped up production due to the unstable international situation. Its output is equivalent to that of 1917. It is reported that since last autumn, the number of workers in the factory has increased from 2,100 to 3,200. Colonel Ramsey, the factory director, did not give a precise date for completing the production of weapons, but said that the factory's output was greatest in 1918, with a total of 13,000 workers employed. The factory authorities are now taking appropriate measures to prevent accidents. All guards are carrying guns and are on alert, and all workers are subjected to strict inspections. The factory produces a variety of products, including tank gun carriages, anti-aircraft guns, field gun carriages, aircraft machine guns, tank machine guns, and Browning machine guns. It is reported that the cost of each tank gun carriage is between US$250,000 and US$300,000, while the cost of each anti-aircraft gun is US$31,420. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation has also sent personnel to protect the factory to prevent spies from sabotaging it. If the United States becomes embroiled in war, the factory's output can only supply a small part of the needs, estimated at 1,000 rifles, 250 machine guns, 500 automatic rifles, and multiple tank carriages per day. The factory's current output is equivalent to that of April 1917. The United States entered the European War in May. (AP, 16th)</p>

<p>(Paris) After the recent accidents involving the American submarine "Squalus" and the British submarine "Thetis," a French submarine is now reported missing. The "Phoenix," a submarine belonging to the French Far East Fleet, carrying 71 officers and men, submerged yesterday morning in Cam Ranh Bay, 300 kilometers outside Saigon harbor, and has since disappeared. According to a statement issued by the Ministry of the Navy, the ships of the Far East Fleet stationed in Saigon harbor immediately set out to search, and several seaplanes participated in the operation, but there have been no results. The headquarters of the Far East Fleet speculates that the submarine suddenly lost its balance during submersion and sank for some reason. The "Phoenix" submarine had a displacement of 1,379 tons, a length of 92 meters, a width of 8.20 meters, a speed of 18 knots on the surface and 10 knots underwater, and was equipped with one 100mm gun, one 73mm anti-aircraft gun, one machine gun, and 11 torpedo tubes. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French submarine "Phenix" that was lost yesterday off Saigon is one of four "Laubeuf"-class first-class submarines built in 1928 and launched in 1930. The "Phenix" was built by the Dubigeon shipyard, has a surface speed of 18 miles per hour, an underwater speed of 10 miles per hour, a 6,000-horsepower engine, a length of 92 meters, a width of 8.2 meters, and is equipped with 10 55cm torpedo tubes, a cannon, an anti-aircraft gun, and a machine gun. The submarine typically has a crew of 63, but there were 71 people on board when it was lost off Saigon. (Haitong, 17th)</p>

<p>Manila: Regarding the sinking of the French submarine "Phoenix," the US Navy awaited a request for assistance from the French side in Saigon, and the US rescue ship "Pigeon" is currently undergoing repairs in the shipyard and cannot be dispatched for the time being. When the unfortunate news was learned here, it was actually 48 hours after the incident occurred. Even if rescue efforts were made, they would not be of practical help. (AP, 17th)</p>
<p>Saigon: The French cruiser "Pique" has returned here after searching for the submarine "Phoenix" without success. There is now no hope for the submarine. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Saigon: French ships in Vietnam today flew flags at half-mast to mourn the officers and men who perished in the "Phoenix" submarine. The submarine submerged outside Saigon and never resurfaced. It is generally believed that the "Phoenix" sank in 300 feet of water six miles off the coast of the new naval base of Con Son Bay. The tragic news was kept secret here yesterday. It is now reported that another French submarine, the "Espoir," submerged at 0330 on June 15 and surfaced at the scheduled time. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Saigon: Several French warships are now anchored at the site where oil slicks are visible on the surface, as it is believed that this is where the French submarine "Phoenix" sank. It is now impossible to take any further measures to determine the exact location of the submarine. It is certain that water has entered the submarine, causing the crew to perish. The submarine is designed to withstand pressure at a depth of 300 feet, but it is now believed that it sank at a greater depth. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<p>(Washington) US President Roosevelt still hopes that the Neutrality Act proposed by Secretary of State Hull can be promulgated and implemented during this session of Congress.

The bill also fails to stipulate how to restrain the actions of the Japanese in China.

<h3 id="e25">Japanese Troops in Xuzhou Invade Xiao County; Xiao County Residents Counterattack, Pressing on Xuzhou City; Japanese Army Launches Five-Pronged Offensive; Chinese Inflict Heavy Losses on Japanese in Three Areas <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Japanese Army Headquarters in Xuzhou, considering Xiao County a major anti-Japanese base, launched a large-scale invasion of Xiao County on the 27th of last month, deploying forces in five directions. One route departed from Huangkou, searching the Zhangdatun and Linlou areas. Another route went to Zhaolou in the Fifth District, burning down the Fifth District Office. One route went from Yongcheng towards Wazikou, one from Gushan towards Wangzhai in the west, and one from Xiao County towards Wangtaizi in the south. The five routes of Japanese troops numbered 1,200, supported by six aircraft, fifty-seven armored vehicles, and three tanks dispatched from Xuzhou. The Chinese regular troops, guerrillas, etc., usually lay dormant in various villages, so the Japanese troops could not find them, and were able to dash around unimpeded. Later, the regular troops and guerrillas gathered in the Zhangshankou area west of Gushan Fort in southeastern Xiao County. County Magistrate Peng Xiaoqian and various anti-Japanese leaders quickly organized a rapid response force, which rushed back to scout the return routes of the Japanese troops and ambushed them separately, preparing to strike. One force ambushed Wazikou, engaging the Japanese in a fierce battle for four hours. The Japanese were unable to withstand it and burned down dozens of villages near Wazikou. One force ambushed Magge in the Sixth District, and one force ambushed Wu Cenlin Xiaoshahe. All three ambushes resulted in fierce encounters with the Japanese troops. The Chinese forces, occupying superior terrain, densely deployed light machine guns in the wheat fields, firing at the Japanese troops. As a result, the three ambushes together annihilated over 150 Japanese soldiers and seized over forty rifles. On the Chinese side, one company commander was killed in action, and twenty to thirty soldiers were wounded or killed. After being ambushed by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops, except for a portion that returned to Xuzhou and other original defenses, scattered and occupied Wangtaizi, Houwa, and other places. To eliminate village boundaries to prevent Chinese army attacks, the Japanese burned all the villages near those they occupied. They also chopped down trees and set up sentry posts on the houses. Anyone entering the village was immediately shot. The villagers, at this time of wheat harvest, were unable to return home, and were extremely resentful, all requesting to join the anti-Japanese resistance. County Magistrate Peng, seeing that the people's anti-Japanese sentiment was so strong, adjusted the county's guerrilla forces and regular troops, selecting a thousand elite soldiers to counterattack Xuzhou as revenge. On the first day of this month, the elite forces were divided into two routes to counterattack Xuzhou. One route advanced to Duanzhuang west of Xuzhou City (two li from Xuzhou City), and one route advanced to Sanggongmiao Taishanying (about three li from Xuzhou City), engaging the Japanese troops separately. They seized all the guns from the pro-Japanese maintenance committees and village guards along the way, and resolved the puppet organizations. The two routes completed their guerrilla missions and returned safely, causing the Japanese army headquarters in Xuzhou City to feel that the Xiao County guerrillas were very troublesome. Furthermore, County Magistrate Peng of Xiao County has now ordered all districts to demolish all the village forts and bunkers to prevent the Japanese army from occupying them. The villagers are now demolishing them one after another.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Mob Twice Tears Down Slogans; Puppet Police Sweep Away Those Destroying Slogans</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: The Hangzhou People's Assembly, organized by local thugs Zhu Zhiwen, Hao Zhongzhao, and others, often bullies civilians by pretending to have authority, causing public resentment to boil over. Previously, Zhu Fusheng, the manager of the Yangbatou National Goods Store, out of righteous indignation, tore down several slogans of the People's Assembly posted in the store, and was arrested by the Japanese Military Police and his fate is unknown to this day. On the 11th of this month, in the theater of the store, three audience members, Yu Laifen, He Abing, and Shen Jinshi, tore down the slogans of the People's Assembly posted in the theater and beat up a ticket collector named Shen Yuesen. The store notified the Tongren Temple puppet police station, which dispatched puppet police to arrest them. The hatred of the Hangzhou people for the People's Assembly is evident.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Achievements of the Guangxi Provincial Provisional Assembly; Ninety-Six Important Proposals Passed <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Guangxi Correspondence: The members of the First Guangxi Provincial Provisional Assembly, after being designated by the central government, began to convene in early May. By May 20, the members had successively arrived in Guilin. On the 21st, the meeting was officially opened, and the opening ceremony was held in the Provincial Government Auditorium. The speaker, deputy speakers, secretary-general, assembly members, and guests were seated in order. After the meeting began, Chief Bai of the Southwest Headquarters delivered a speech on behalf of the headquarters. Xia Wei, Chief of Staff of the Guangxi Pacification Headquarters, reported on military affairs, and Huang Xuchu, Chairman of the Provincial Government, reported on political affairs. Subsequently, the heads of the Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction Departments all reported on their duties. From the 21st, the meeting lasted for eighteen consecutive days, closing on June 7. When the closing ceremony was held, it was still held in the Provincial Government Auditorium. Deputy Speaker Chen first delivered a speech, followed by Wang Zemin, Chief Advisor of the Southwest Headquarters, delivering a speech on behalf of Chief Bai, offering three points of practical views on the future construction of Guangxi: 1. Refreshing education and raising cultural standards; 2. Strengthening national military training and mass organization, and implementing the Three Principles of People's Livelihood; 3. Implementing national spiritual mobilization and promoting inherent morality. After Chief Bai's representative finished his speech, Chairman Huang and assembly member Meng Minwei, representing all the assembly members, gave responses. It is because assembly member Meng is particularly senior, being sixty-nine years old this year, and having previously served as a member of the National Assembly, that the entire assembly respected him as an elder statesman. During the eighteen-day session, a total of ninety-six proposals were passed, of which more than twenty were matters submitted by the government for discussion. In addition to the motion to telegraph the central government to issue a formal warrant for the arrest of Wang Jingwei, which was unanimously passed by the entire assembly, the remaining cases included more than twenty related to civil affairs and finance, more than ten related to economic construction, and several related to education, culture, and local autonomy. In addition, there were various proposals to strengthen mass organization, promote agricultural cooperation, improve farmers' lives, improve the resettlement of wounded soldiers in the war of resistance, develop industry and reclamation, and resettle refugees. The results were all considered satisfactory. On the day of the closing ceremony, resident assembly members were mutually elected to handle all daily official duties. Huang Shaosu, Luo Guangfu, Zhang Yiqi, Jiang Peiying, Huang Lisheng, Nong Shumo, and Chen Shaoyu were selected as resident committee members. All the resolutions and various proposals are being sorted out by the assembly and sent to the government for implementation separately.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Foreign Trade Situation in Fujian Province; Statistics for the First Quarter of This Year <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The foreign trade situation in Fujian Province for the first quarter of this year (January, February, and March) has now been released by the Provincial Government Statistics Office as follows:</p>
<p>Total Trade Value</p>
<p>The total value of trade in the province for this quarter is 28,311,137 yuan, an increase of 6,652,569 yuan compared to the previous quarter (fourth quarter of the 27th year), and an increase of 10,624,589 yuan compared to the same quarter last year (first quarter of the 27th year). This shows that the province's trade is gradually approaching pre-war levels. The import trade for this quarter is 14,287,754 yuan, and the export trade is 14,023,383 yuan. The import surplus has been greatly reduced, reaching only 264,371 yuan.</p>
<p>Monthly Situation</p>
<p>Among the months in this quarter, the trade volume in January was the largest, totaling 12,710,710 yuan, because it was near the Lunar New Year, and import and export cargo deliveries were booming. Among them, imports accounted for 8,560,652 yuan, creating an export surplus of 4,410,598 yuan, which is the only one since the War of Resistance. The trade volume in February shrank to 6,558,901 yuan, of which imports accounted for 4,415,236 yuan and exports accounted for 2,143,665 yuan, resulting in an import surplus of 2,271,571 yuan. Both import and export trade rebounded in March, with a total value of 9,041,526 yuan, of which imports accounted for 5,722,462 yuan and exports accounted for 3,319,064 yuan, resulting in an import surplus of 2,403,398 yuan.</p>
<p>Customs Statistics</p>
<p>In this quarter, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Sandu customs held their position in trade. Fuzhou has surpassed Xiamen and occupies an absolute advantage, with a total trade value of 22,345,292 yuan, accounting for 78.9% of the total trade in this quarter. Since its fall, Xiamen has gradually lost its importance, which is even more evident in this quarter, with a total trade value of only 5,782,470 yuan, accounting for only 20.4% of the province's trade. The decline in trade at Sandu Customs is particularly severe, with a total value of only 183,375 yuan for the entire quarter, accounting for only 0.7% of the province's trade. Imports and exports in February were both at a standstill, which shows one aspect of its trade slump. In terms of the import and export surplus situation of the three customs, Fuzhou is the only export surplus port. Except for February, exports in January and March both exceeded imports. Sandu has always been an export surplus port and a distribution center for products in eastern Fujian. This quarter, it turned into an import surplus of 41,527 yuan. The import surplus at Xiamen Customs is even greater, reaching 1,943,354 yuan.</p>
<p>Domestic Trade</p>
<p>The total value of trade between the three customs and various ports in China reached 21,058,277 yuan, accounting for 75.1% of the total trade in this quarter. In terms of domestic trade imports and exports, Fuzhou Customs ranks first, with imports accounting for 7,939,557 yuan and exports accounting for 10,284,207 yuan. Xiamen Customs ranks second, with imports accounting for 1,746,820 yuan and exports accounting for 1,052,374 yuan. Sandu Customs is the smallest, with only 35,319 yuan in exports. In terms of domestic trade, this quarter is in an export surplus position, with an export surplus of 1,685,523 yuan.</p>
<p>Direct Foreign Trade</p>
<p>The total value of direct trade between the three customs and various countries reached 7,252,860 yuan, accounting for 24.9% of the total trade in this quarter. In direct foreign trade, Fuzhou Customs also ranks first, with imports of foreign goods accounting for 2,372,834 yuan and exports of domestic goods to foreign countries accounting for 1,788,694 yuan. Xiamen Customs ranks second, with imports of foreign goods accounting for 1,746,820 yuan and exports of domestic goods to foreign countries accounting for 867,180 yuan. Sandu Customs has imports of foreign goods accounting for 112,451 yuan and exports of domestic goods to foreign countries accounting for 35,605 yuan. In direct trade, this quarter is in a deficit position, with an import surplus of 1,949,894 yuan. However, since mid-March, the Japanese side has intensified its blockade of the South China ports. One party dispatched warships to station outside the ports of Fuzhou and Quanzhou, arbitrarily inspecting and detaining or intercepting goods from ships from various countries, or towing away ships. One party dispatched planes to continuously fly to various coastal areas to carry out large-scale bombing, and the commercial markets were greatly affected. In order to complete war preparedness, the government actively evacuated people and goods to avoid hindering operations and reduce unnecessary sacrifices. Therefore, import and export cargo transportation was at a standstill. It is expected that the foreign trade in the second quarter will be vastly different compared to the first quarter.</p>

<h3 id="e28">This Year's World PEN Congress Decided to Be Held in Stockholm, Sweden; Session from September 4th to 8th; Chinese Delegate Xiong Shiyi to Attend <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>This year's World PEN Congress has been decided to be held in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, from September 4th to 8th. Renowned writers from various countries around the world will attend, with an expected attendance of over three hundred people. Figures such as Thomas Mann, Hauptmann, Werfel, Croce, and Wells have already confirmed their attendance. The opening ceremony will be held at the Stockholm City Hall, with Jules Romains serving as chairman. The following day, King Gustaf of Sweden will host a tea party at the Royal Palace, and various theaters in Stockholm will stage famous plays to mark the occasion. The World PEN Congress was originally an organization dedicated to pure culture and arts, without involving itself in politics. However, given the increasingly pressing global crisis, a sense of justice and humanity persists. As a result, the PEN Congress has also engaged in certain political activities. For example, four years ago, when the PEN Congress was scheduled to be held in Rome, at the time of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, major literary figures refused to participate. Similarly, exiled writers from Spain, Czechoslovakia, and Austria have been provided with relief through fundraising led by the PEN Congress. It is expected that this year's annual meeting will express sympathy for China's valiant resistance against Japan. It is reported that Xiong Shiyi has been confirmed as China's representative at this year's annual meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Overview of Physical Education in China (II) <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The number of participants and the content of programs have increased year by year, and enthusiasm has grown daily. The Sixth National Games should have been held in the capital in the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], but due to the full-scale War of Resistance against Japan, preparations were halted.</p>
<p>International Sports</p>
<p>China's participation in international sports activities originally centered on the Far Eastern Games. However, due to the issue of the puppet state of Manchukuo, China insisted on its position and did not agree [to participate], leading to the dissolution of the games. This, in turn, promoted China's activities in genuine international sports arenas. For example, participation in the Davis Cup tennis tournament was one aspect. In the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932], China formally participated in the World Games. In the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1936], a delegation of over a hundred people was organized to participate in the Eleventh World Games. At the same time, the Ministry of Education and the China National Amateur Athletic Federation organized a sports observation group to accompany the World Games delegation to Europe to study the sports systems of seven countries: Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, and Italy. They also attended the Second International Leisure Conference. After the observation, a report was compiled, and opinions were submitted to the government for adoption and implementation. Its impact on the progress of domestic sports was not insignificant.</p>
<p>Teacher Training</p>
<p>The lack of physical education teachers was keenly felt in the development process. Apart from the physical education departments at National Central University and Beijing Normal University, there were very few institutions for training physical education teachers. As a result, private physical education schools emerged in response to the need. The provinces of Jiangsu and Shanghai were the most active in establishing such schools. After the principle that normal schools should be run by the government was decided, some provinces and cities also established physical education vocational schools. However, in terms of quantity, there was still a shortage. In the future, not only should the quantity meet the demand, but the content of training should also be actively improved to ensure that the graduates can truly shoulder the responsibility of physical education.</p>
<p>Adult Literacy Education Promotion Association Held a Council Meeting and Elected Standing Directors</p>
<p>The Adult Compulsory Education Promotion Association was formally established some days ago, and various groups and individuals have taken responsibility for running more than 20 classes of schools.

The last match between Lu Dawei of Datong and Sun Guangqi of Aurora was the most intense. Lu Dawei finally defeated Sun Guangqi 3-2. In the end, Datong defeated Aurora 4-3 and won the championship. In the exhibition match, the Jewish table tennis champion Di Fei and his wife defeated Chen Linsheng and Zhang Jiazhen 21-12 in mixed doubles. Chen and Zhang had just decided to cooperate, and Zhang's table tennis skills were relatively inferior. Chen was unable to support the situation alone and was defeated. Chen defeated Di Fei's wife in the charity match. It is reported that Di Fei has challenged Chen and will choose another date to perform. In the doubles exhibition match, Lu Hanjun and Li Zongpei defeated Ma Tingliang and Yue Junchang 21-8. In the team performance, Qingyun Association defeated the mixed team 6-1. In the final singles exhibition match, the Shanghai champion Lu Hanjun played against the former champion Rong Dening. The battle was full of highlights and drew a lot of applause. After the competition, Lu Wenying personally presented the awards. The runner-up, due to Aurora, Kwong Wah, and University of Shanghai, will be decided at a later date. The individual championship will be decided at a later date by Zhou Zhiqian, Qian Yushu, Lu Dawei of Datong, and Liu Zongren of Kwong Wah.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Shooting Incident on Swatow Road Last Night Jin Yu and Four Others Injured Gao Lansheng's Injuries Are the Most Serious Another Person, surnamed You, Went to the Hospital on His Own <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>At 9:15 p.m. last night, a shooting incident occurred on Swatow Road in the Public Concession. A total of six people were injured at the scene, including two passers-by who were hit by stray bullets. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Bookstore Hosts a Banquet</p>
<p>A New Tan Chun bookstore in Sanyuanfang on Swatow Road hosted a banquet last night. More than ten guests arrived around 8 p.m. At that time, two tables of standard wine and banquets were prepared. After everyone took their seats, the banquet began to break up at 9:15 p.m., and all the guests left the bookstore.</p>
<p>Rounds of Gunfire</p>
<p>At that time, there were still six or seven guests leaving one after another. Just as they stepped out of the south entrance of Sanyuanfang (Swatow Road) and were about to approach the car, several thugs suddenly jumped out of the darkness on the side of the road. Without asking any questions, they each pulled out handguns and fired randomly at the six or seven guests.</p>
<p>Four Guests Fall to the Ground</p>
<p>As the gunshots rang out, four of the six or seven guests fell to the ground. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the thugs fled in different directions without a trace. At that time, stray bullets also injured two passers-by. Nearby patrol officers arrived quickly and reported to the police station by telephone. In an instant, a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives arrived in police cars.</p>
<p>Injuries Were Common</p>
<p>When the detectives arrived, they first sent the injured people to the hospital in separate cars. The four injured guests included local lawyer Jin Yu (resident of No. 7, Fuchang Lane, 56 Avenue Joffre) who was shot in the left leg, Hangzhou native Gao Lansheng, 38 years old (resident of No. 11, Xinping Lane, Longmen Road) who was shot in the upper right chest and left arm, with more serious injuries, and local Dai Rongkun, 38 years old (resident of No. 46, Fuyu Lane, Lafayette Road) who was shot in the left foot. The above three people were sent to Baolong Hospital.</p>
<p>Spent Cartridges Recovered</p>
<p>Among them, there was also one surnamed You whose injuries were very minor, and he went to the hospital for treatment on his own. As for the two people injured by stray bullets, one was Lu Xiaowu, a native of Jiangbei, who was a boatman, and another also went to the hospital on his own, but his surname is unknown. After the detectives finished their inspection, they recovered several empty cartridges at the entrance of Sanyuanfang Lane, all of which were .25 caliber Browning handgun bullets.</p>
<p>Similar to a Gang Killing</p>
<p>As for the cause of this case, according to general speculation, most of it was a gang killing. Judging from the technique of the shooting by the thugs, they were definitely not trained, and the firearms used were all handguns, with no sharp weapons such as Mauser pistols. The police station is now making every effort to investigate and arrest the murderers.</p>

<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," the "Avenue" branch of the police station at the intersection of the Great Western Road and Columbia Road had been closed by British troops several months ago, with barbed wire erected in front of it. Suddenly, on the night of the 16th, "Avenue" police officers secretly infiltrated the branch from the back door and removed the barbed wire in front of the gate. Several hours later, British troops re-erected the barbed wire because, at dawn, a British patrolman passing by the area saw that the barbed wire had been removed.</p>
<p>Seeing the barbed wire</p>
<p>gone, they summoned a platoon of East Surrey Regiment British soldiers, armed with steel helmets, rifles, bayonets, and daggers, to be stationed in front of the station. It was heard that the "Avenue" police officers did not occupy the station. By 9:00 AM, the British soldiers had ordered them to leave. When reporters went to the area, they saw a group of "Avenue" police officers, armed with weapons, at the end of a street connected to the station. When the reporters tried to take their pictures, the police officers even raised their guns to shoot, so the reporters retreated without taking any photos. This morning (the 17th), a British official issued a statement saying that the Public Concession and "Avenue" personnel are</p>
<p>currently negotiating</p>
<p>regarding the police station. At the same time, British troops had re-erected the barbed wire in front of the station. However, at 1:30 PM, after the British troops withdrew, the "Avenue" police officers, waving rifles and pistols, swarmed to the road in front of the branch station. A large contingent of the Public Concession police force and reserves quickly rushed to the area. British troops had also</p>
<p>taken up position nearby.</p>
<p>Therefore, the intersection of Great Western Road and Columbia Road was very tense. It is reported that the station was closed by British troops because the "Avenue" police officers not only operated in the "badlands" alongside the road, but also intruded into the Public Concession roads within the British defense zone. Japanese newspapers have expressed their dissatisfaction with this action.</p>
<p>Junfeng Silk Factory: A Labor Dispute Occurs, with Workers Petitioning Various Groups for Assistance</p>
<p>The Junfeng Silk Factory, located at 53 Singapore Road in western Shanghai, is owned by Xu Jianfan. Initially, it was quite small, but over the years, due to thriving business, it gradually expanded, increasing its machinery to more than 50 units. After the withdrawal of the National Revolutionary Army during the Battle of Shanghai, due to the decline in market conditions, the factory reduced workers' wages by 40-50%. All the workers, in consideration of labor-management cooperation, reluctantly accepted this. Subsequently, as the factory's business recovered and prospered, and prices in the "Isolated Island" soared, they requested a reasonable wage increase, but it was still 20% lower than before the war. Recently, a worker named Zhu Genmu, who worked on machine number two, was fired by the factory for alleged negligence in his work, as the product was slightly rough. All the workers expressed dissatisfaction and demanded that the factory reinstate him unconditionally. Instead, the factory fired five worker representatives: Tao Songlong, Rui Sheng, Fan Lansheng, Sun Ruhai, and Tan Caoqi. The workers have decided to petition various groups for assistance to secure their livelihoods.</p>

<p>The rice market is in chaos, with rice prices breaking the 20-yuan barrier. The market was forced to close early yesterday morning, and various rice industry groups immediately held a meeting to discuss the situation.</p>
<p>The rice market has been in turmoil for several days due to large-scale hoarding, causing prices to continue to rise. Yesterday morning, the highest price in the trading market exceeded 20 yuan. The market was forced to close. Rice industry groups have scheduled a joint meeting to discuss stabilization measures. The Concession authorities have decided to take strict measures to crack down on speculative hoarding that drives up prices and affects the livelihoods of ordinary people. Here is a detailed account of the situation:</p>
<p>Soaring Rice Prices Break the 20-Yuan Barrier</p>
<p>The Central Government's measures to prevent the Japanese from seizing legal tender and engaging in currency arbitrage have led to an emergency plan to change the exchange rate and stabilize finances. However, opportunistic merchants have taken advantage of this opportunity to engage in large-scale speculation, resulting in the rice market, which has no direct relationship with foreign exchange, being manipulated by hoarders. Prices have risen to unprecedented levels, soaring past 19 yuan. Yesterday morning, after the market opened, not only did prices fail to fall, but they continued to rise, exceeding 20 yuan. The highest price approached 21 yuan. Hoarders not only refused to release their stocks but continued to absorb large quantities.</p>
<p>Market Forced to Close Early</p>
<p>The Rice Market Management Committee, seeing the continuous and unchecked rise in rice prices, observed that the market was filled with buyers clamoring, while sellers remained hesitant. The situation was extremely chaotic. Fearing further escalation, the Management Committee was forced to close the market early at 10:35 AM. They also issued a public statement stating that any disputes arising from unauthorized price increases outside of market transactions would not be accepted for resolution.</p>
<p>Rice Industry Groups Meet to Discuss Stabilization</p>
<p>Various rice industry groups, including the Bean and Rice Trade Association, Rice Shop Association, Rice Milling Association, Changshu Rice Association, Nanbang Association, Rice Grain Merchants, and Shanghai North Rice Transport Merchants Association, recognizing that the continuous rise in rice prices over the past week, if not properly addressed, would have a significant impact on the future of people's food supply, have specifically scheduled a joint meeting within the next week to discuss stabilization measures.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Closely Monitoring</p>
<p>The Concession authorities previously issued an official statement stating that "there is no need to restrict rice prices in Shanghai," which emboldened speculators to recklessly drive up prices. Now, the authorities are reportedly paying close attention to these illegal and abnormal activities in the rice market, which affect the livelihoods of ordinary people and cannot be ignored. They will take strict measures against speculators based on previously agreed-upon regulations to thoroughly punish them and stabilize rice prices in Shanghai as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The "Daobao" newspaper office was attacked last night. More than 20 shots were fired, and hand grenades were thrown, shattering glass windows, doors, and lights. The interior was undamaged. - An elderly laundry woman, frightened, jumped from the building and was injured.</p>
<p>Yesterday, at around 9:10 PM, the "Daobao" newspaper office, located at 130 Ningbo Road and published by the British-owned China University Bookstore Co., Ltd. in this city, was suddenly attacked by five or six men carrying Mauser pistols, resulting in the injury of a laundry woman. Here's a report of the incident:</p>
<p>Hand Grenades Thrown, Fortunately Did Not Explode</p>
<p>The newspaper office's front door faces Ningbo Road, while the back door leads to a lane. Last night at around 9:00 PM, the front iron gate was locked when five or six men arrived at the scene. Two of them stood watch at the entrance of the lane, while the other three men entered the newspaper office through the back door, firing shots and throwing hand grenades. Fortunately, the grenades did not explode. At that time, a few staff members, hearing the alarm, tried to report the incident to the police while immediately taking cover and turning off the main power switch.</p>
<p>More Than 20 Shots Fired</p>
<p>The men fired about twenty shots, shattering all the glass windows, glass doors, and lights. Fragments were scattered all over the floor. At that time, an elderly laundry woman, Qiu Lu, 47 years old, was delivering freshly washed clothes to the office. Hearing the dense gunfire in the corridor, she, unaware of the situation, jumped from the upper floor, breaking her spine. She was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by ambulance.</p>
<p>The Newspaper Office's Interior Suffered No Damage</p>
<p>Except for the shattered glass windows, the interior of the newspaper office was undamaged. The reporter arrived at the scene at around 10:00 PM and saw only dim lights, glass shards, and fragments of cement on the ground. A large crowd of onlookers gathered nearby. The Chinese police bravely fired their guns to stop the men during the shooting. Upon receiving the news, the police station dispatched a large number of detectives to search the area. The gunmen had already fled in different directions. The police are currently conducting a detailed investigation into the incident.</p>
<p>Vietnamese Anthracite Coal Shipped to Shanghai for Storage; Over 1,000 Tons Shipped Daily to Shanghai, Sufficient for Use in Case of Emergency</p>
<p>According to the "North-China Daily News", late in the evening on Thursday, a large pile of coal accumulated between the meteorological signal tower on the Bund of the French Concession and the Statue of Peace, leading to rumors that Shanghai merchants were rushing to transport large quantities of coal to the port to cope with a possible blockade of the two Concessions here. However, this doubt was immediately dispelled. It is understood that the owners of the coal are unloading coal from barges without sufficient trucks to immediately transport the coal into warehouses. Because the police ordered each ship to sail in and unload its cargo as quickly as possible, there was no other way but to stockpile the coal in that one vacant lot. However, it is known for certain that 1,500 tons of anthracite coal arrive in Shanghai from French Vietnam every day. This anthracite coal is almost exclusively used for domestic heating. From this point of view, Shanghai seems to be gradually accumulating a large amount of coal, which can not only cope with emergencies but also ensure that it can be taken out and used immediately when severe cold weather arrives.</p>
<p>Ningbo Compatriots Request Resumption of Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Route</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association, in order to alleviate the rice shortage in Ningbo and maintain Shanghai-Ningbo transportation, convened the 14th joint meeting of the Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee yesterday afternoon. More than 20 people attended, including Yu Zuoting, Qin Runqing, Fang Jiaobo, Ye Xiangyu, and Wu Yaqin. The results of the discussion included: 1. Continuing to purchase foreign rice and transport it to Ningbo to stabilize prices; 2. Requesting the authorities to resume the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route to facilitate travel for Ningbo merchants. However, the above resolutions will be implemented after review and approval by Chairman Yu Qiaqing.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on requests from various industries that it is currently the Dragon Boat Festival and businesses are extremely busy collecting payments, and that the prohibition of passengers on the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route is truly inconvenient, requested that the Zhejiang Provincial Military Authorities be telegraphed. Subsequently, for merchants going to Ningbo to collect debts, please allow them to disembark with a certificate from the Chamber of Commerce to facilitate commerce. Now, a telegram reply has been received from the Ningbo Garrison Commander stating that, due to the restrictions of the ban, it is not possible to comply.</p>

<p>Our newspaper reporter, Mr. Qu Shaoyi, was in danger yesterday. A bullet hit his hip, and it has been removed. The assailant was arrested and detained in the police station. Mr. Qu is in good spirits and is expected to recover soon.</p>
<p>Mr. Qu Shaoyi, a reporter for this newspaper, is usually kind and sincere in his dealings with people. He studied law in his early years and has therefore practiced law in Shanghai for many years, resolving difficulties and disputes and being highly trusted by all sectors of society. His law office is located on Meibai Road. Yesterday morning at 7:15 AM, a man dressed in a Chinese tunic suit came to the office to see him. At that time, Mr. Qu had gone to court to attend a mediation session and had not returned. The man then left. At around 11:00 AM, Mr. Qu returned to his office after finishing his work. The man visited again for the second time. Mr. Qu cordially received him. Unexpectedly, the man suddenly drew a pistol and shot Mr. Qu in the left hip. The second bullet failed to fire because the cartridge jammed. At that time, Mr. Qu, for the sake of self-defense, raised a chair next to him to defend himself. Seeing that the staff of Mr. Qu's office had gone out to report the incident to the police, the man fled in panic. At that moment, the Chinese police officers 560 and 2340 at the entrance of the alley heard the alarm and saw the man fleeing into the alley. They bravely apprehended him and took him to the police station for investigation. Mr. Qu was taken to the hospital for treatment by his family. The bullet was removed from his hip by doctors in the afternoon. His relatives and friends, upon hearing the news, came to visit him. Seeing that Mr. Qu was in good spirits, as usual, they expected him to recover soon.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement launches "Safety First" campaign, starting today with a week of propaganda, encouraging pedestrians and vehicles to prioritize safety, and drivers to drive with caution. Mutual courtesy and consideration are key.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession is launching a "Safety First" campaign for the safety of pedestrians within the Concession, aiming to urge all kinds of pedestrians and vehicles to strive to avoid danger. Given the alarming number of road accidents in Shanghai in 1938, which totaled 15,813 cases, resulting in 213 deaths and 4,953 injuries, the Safety Campaign is urgently needed. The purpose is to broadly promote that every accident can be avoided and to raise awareness among all citizens. "Safety First" week begins today and runs until June 24.</p>
<p>Working Together</p>
<p>Slogans and advertisements related to the safety campaign, as well as "Safety First" stickers, have been posted on various roads, public places, and vehicles, and can be seen everywhere. Various organizations, such as the taxi industry, rickshaw industry, tonghu (three-wheeled vehicle) industry, and transportation vehicle industry, as well as tram and bus companies in both concessions, are working together to urge drivers or car owners to participate and pay attention. Starting today, hundreds of storytellers will give short stories in normally crowded locations to the general uneducated classes to explain the need to be careful when walking.</p>
<p>Guiding Pedestrians</p>
<p>The police department has ordered traffic police to do their best to guide pedestrians so that they walk on sidewalks and to show them how to cross the road at intersections with traffic lights and controlled by traffic police. Movie theaters and other entertainment venues have also been asked to insert promotional texts into their programs warning audiences not to be negligent when walking. Dozens of Chinese and foreign radio stations set aside certain times each day to promote this campaign to draw the attention of listeners.</p>
<p>Drive Safely</p>
<p>The Municipal Council has also printed a booklet entitled "Drive Safely", sending it to car owners for reading and then handing it over to drivers for detailed reading so that they can perform their driving duties in a completely safe manner. The contents are as follows:</p>
<p>The Meaning of Safety</p>
<p>(1) When driving from a side road onto or across a main road, be extremely careful and drive slowly, always giving way to vehicles on the main road. (2) When driving a slow-moving vehicle, pay special attention to staying close to the correct lane. (3) Pay attention to staying close to the appropriate lane when turning. (4) When turning right, turning left, or crossing the road, do not forget to signal with your hand to warn vehicles coming from behind. (5) Never make a wide right turn unless you are sure that there are no other vehicles behind you trying to overtake you. (6) Before starting from a curb or deviating from your straight path, be sure to honk to warn others. (7) When overtaking a slow-moving vehicle, give proper warning first, and then overtake it without delay. Never overtake vehicles at corners, bends in the road, or intersections. (8) When passing pedestrians, horses, bicycles, and other vehicles, leave plenty of room. (9) Give way to vehicles that can travel faster than you. (10) Pay attention to pedestrians emerging from between parked vehicles. (11) Stopping behind a line of traffic can save time or save fines.</p>
<p>Drive Safely</p>
<p>(1) Never rashly overtake and cut in. You should consider the driver of the vehicle in front. (2) Do not become angry at being overtaken by other vehicles and speed forward. (3) Never drive too fast. (4) When passing through intersections without police supervision, drive slowly and make sure there is no obstruction ahead. (5) Never open car doors before stopping. (6) Never get out on the right side of the car. Always be careful to get out on the left side, close to the curb. (7) Never use your high beams to dazzle oncoming vehicles. (8) Never overtake a tram and then immediately cut in front of it. Since trams run on rails, they cannot give way. (9) Never move an injured person. Wait for the ambulance to arrive. (10) Do not forget that the time required to avoid an accident is more than the time required to report an accident.</p>
<p>Use Signals</p>
<p>(1) Using designated signals at the appropriate time can avoid many accidents. (2) Learn and obey traffic regulations. (3) When giving driving signals, they must be clear, timely, and correct. Do not be complex and unclear, causing the public to be unable to understand. (4) Before a driver takes any action, he must ensure that his signal is recognized by the driver behind him before proceeding. (5) Signals must be used by the driver himself; passengers must never use them.</p>
<p>French Police Posted Notices</p>
<p>The French Concession police department has posted safety campaign notices throughout the Concession, stating: "In recent years, the population within the French Concession has increased greatly, and the number of cars, light vehicles, and pedestrians on the roads has also increased. Unfortunately, traffic accidents have also increased. In 1938, 48 people died in traffic accidents, and 1,555 were injured. The number of accidents must be reduced urgently. There is only one way to reduce the number of accidents: pedestrians, rickshaw pullers, tonghu drivers, small car drivers, those riding by car, and car drivers must resolutely respect traffic regulations and obey the orders of traffic police. It is better to drive a little slower than to be the cause of an accident or the victim of an accident."</p>
<p>Tonghu and Rickshaw Industries</p>
<p>Tonghu and rickshaws are important means of transportation, and both industries are paying close attention to the "Safety First" campaign.</p>
<p>Tonghu Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tonghu Vehicle Mutual Aid Association is participating in the "Safety First" campaign and has organized ten propaganda teams. Starting today, the Association's Secretary-General Ge Futian and Gao Youyu will guide their colleagues in various districts to pay attention to traffic safety. They have also printed five safety guidelines to be distributed to car owners and posted on their vehicles for compliance: (1) Drive close to the sidewalk. The closer, the better. (2) Signal by extending your arm before turning right, turning left, or going diagonally. (3) Obey traffic lights and the orders of traffic police. (4) If it is not necessary, do not travel on crowded streets. (5) Goods must be tied firmly when carrying cargo.</p>

<p>Evidence of Ding Geller's tragic death: Shirt and pants covered in blood, with traces of being dragged on the ground. Witnesses from Lun Chang presented the clothing to the court.</p>
<p>According to the "North-China Daily News", the case of Lun Chang Spinning Mill supervisor Ding Geller's death on June 6, in a conflict with Japanese marine soldiers at the mill, where he was stabbed with bayonets and died at the Country Hospital, was continued yesterday (the 16th) by British coroner Haines. Ding's white shirt and yellow shorts, which he was wearing during the conflict, were presented to the court for inspection. They were covered in blood and showed signs of being dragged on the ground. The first witness to testify was Lun Chang factory engineer Grant (whose testimony was reported yesterday). It was decided that Lun Chang factory textile supervisors Kurt Hui and Robert S. Z. should testify about their observations of Ding's conflict with the Japanese soldiers. Their testimonies were similar to those of the witnesses in the previous hearing.</p>
<p>British Consulate Investigates the Incident</p>
<p>Next, Ford, a consul at the British Consulate-General in Shanghai, testified that on June 6, at 2:10 PM, he was dispatched to the Lun Chang Spinning Mill in Pudong. Shortly after 2:30 PM, he arrived at the mill and questioned witnesses to the incident that occurred that morning. Ding was indeed stabbed with bayonets. He then accompanied three Lun Chang employees to visit Major Noji, the commander of the Japanese Marine Corps in Pudong, aiming to confirm Ding's injuries and, if possible, to secure his release. However, Noji refused to allow him to meet with Ding. At nearly 5:00 PM, he was negotiating with Noji when he telephoned the British Consulate-General, reporting that Ding had been injured but that he was not allowed to meet with him. As the Consulate-General was already in direct negotiations on the matter, he was ordered to return immediately. However, as there was no motorboat, he remained at the Marine Corps headquarters. At 7:00 PM, Noji introduced him to the surgeon who treated Ding's wounds. He inquired about Ding's injuries through an interpreter. The surgeon said that Ding's injuries were not serious, that he was initially very agitated, but that after an injection, he had calmed down and was quite comfortable. Although he had only drunk water, he could eat porridge the next morning. The surgeon repeatedly assured him of this. He then returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Lun Chang Supervisor Testifies About What He Saw</p>
<p>Scott, the technology supervisor at the Lun Chang factory, testified that he saw eight Japanese soldiers escorting strikers into the factory. Most of the strikers ran towards the power room. The Japanese soldiers did not try to stop them. He and Sharper then went to the office to get guns. Soon after, Ding came out of his office, followed by the witness. He then saw two Japanese soldiers with crossed rifles in front of Ding. Ding tried to push the two soldiers down. The witness approached them, and when he was 20 yards away, the fighting stopped. Ding was bleeding from the mouth and was pale. He returned to the office area with the witness. The witness then left Ding and Xia to ask the Japanese soldiers to lead the well-behaved workers back but was unsuccessful. A few minutes later, Noji arrived. The witness and Xia went to meet him, leaving Ding behind. While reporting the incident to Noji, he heard a scuffle again. Xia left, and soon after, Noji followed. The witness then looked around to see what had happened, only to have a Japanese officer knock him to the ground. Three Japanese soldiers stood in front of him. After speaking to them through an interpreter, the witness was allowed to get up and turn to look at the scene of the scuffle. At the same time, the witness handed his gun to the Japanese officer. Ding was being beaten by several Japanese soldiers. Noji also punched Ding. Then, they dragged Ding about 30 yards before Ding got up on his own. The witness accompanied Ding to the hospital. The Japanese doctor only stopped the bleeding from Ding's wounds, applied some iodine, sewed up some bayonet wounds, and tied some bandages around Ding's waist before moving Ding into a cell. The witness then took Ding's clothes and pants from the hospital.</p>
<p>Ding's Clothing Covered in Blood</p>
<p>At that point, Smith produced a white shirt and yellow shorts, with the left trouser leg and left waist area covered in blood. Smith continued, saying that these were the clothes Ding was wearing. Since the Japanese soldiers did not seem to be trying to stop the strikers, the witness was armed for self-defense and to protect property. At that point, the coroner adjourned the hearing until 10:00 AM on Monday.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Black Market Foreign Exchange Achieves New Level, Briefly Fluctuates Due to Speculator Rumors Yesterday, Public Reassured After Banking Sector Explanation <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Following the British-owned Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's (HSBC) supplying of black market foreign exchange to meet legitimate needs as much as possible, the market has stabilized and prices have been steady. Yesterday, due to rumors spread by speculators, cash prices soared, reaching a new record. The banking sector has vigorously refuted the rumors and explained the true situation, as detailed below:</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Stabilizes, Rumors Subside</p>
<p>After adjustments by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, foreign exchange in Shanghai's black market has become stable. HSBC continues to supply foreign exchange as much as possible to meet the legitimate needs of various industries. Public confidence has strengthened and rumors have disappeared. The exchange rate seems to have reached a so-called new level of six shillings six pence for British pounds and twelve yuan six jiao two fen five li for US dollars. This indirect suppression of the black market exchange rate aims to correct trade imbalances and reduce import surpluses from the occupied areas, a measure supported by both Chinese and foreign experts.</p>
<p>HSBC Maximizes Supply</p>
<p>At 11:30 AM yesterday, rumors arose in the Shanghai black market that HSBC had stopped supplying foreign exchange, causing speculators to seize the opportunity and push cash prices to unprecedented new highs, approaching 2,700 yuan. According to reliable sources obtained by a New Life News Agency reporter from the banking sector, HSBC routinely stops selling foreign exchange after 11:00 AM on Saturdays due to afternoon holidays. Therefore, yesterday's situation does not indicate that the bank will no longer supply foreign exchange in the future. Market rumors are unreliable.</p>
<p>Legitimate Needs Face No Shortage</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, after the banking sector refuted the rumors, public confidence was restored and the rumors subsided. Recalling past unnecessary worries, people are now laughing at their shortsightedness. In reality, foreign exchange in Shanghai's black market remains stable, standing at the so-called new level. Only those who worry about rising prices due to the reduced exchange rate are concerned, but this so-called reduction only applies to the black market. Legitimate necessities imported from abroad are still supplied at the normal rate of one shilling two pence and a half.</p>
<p>Statutory Foreign Exchange Supplied As Usual</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank confirmed that the statutory standard of one shilling two pence and a half has remained unchanged since the implementation of the legal tender policy. The Central Bank continues to handle applications for statutory foreign exchange in accordance with the regulations, but only for necessities imported before January 1, 1939, and imports specifically approved by the Chinese government. Applications are accepted every Monday, and approvals are announced every Friday, but the number of applications and approvals each week is not large.</p>

<p>The Citizens' Group Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has issued a public appeal urging all sectors to conserve Dragon Boat Festival expenses and transfer them to refugee relief. They urge all to conserve expenses on this day and transfer them to refugee relief funds, so that disaster victims will not face starvation.</p>
<p>Charity Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition for Refugee Children's Home</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified various trade associations, stating that the Shanghai Refugee Children's Home, in order to expand its capacity, provide better care, and implement production education, has rented land and built 27 new buildings at Lane 258, Wuding Road. Construction began on the 14th of last month and is expected to be completed by the end of July, requiring over 35,900 yuan. The previously raised funds, after paying 10,000 yuan for rent, are insufficient for the construction costs by more than 10,000 yuan. Therefore, they are collecting thousands of paintings, calligraphy, and fan paintings by famous figures from ancient and modern times to prepare for an exhibition and issue calligraphy and painting gift certificates in denominations of 10 yuan and 4 yuan, offering gifts while helping those in need. Please ask all trade associations to promote this initiative.</p>
<p>Famous Opera Singers from Various Regions Perform for Fundraising Broadcast</p>
<p>The Refugee Relief Association's Hometown Group Fundraising Committee has invited famous opera singers from various regions to hold a grand joint performance to raise funds for refugees, as reported previously. To expand publicity and fundraising, the committee will hold a fundraising broadcast at the Continental Radio Station (call sign XHHK, frequency 1340) yesterday and today. Committee member Xu Xiaochu and others will deliver opening remarks. In addition to famous opera singers from various regions, the Juju Society, Ping Society, Banking Industry Association, and Sheng Society will also participate in the broadcast. Ticket purchases have been enthusiastic. The public performances are scheduled for the evenings of the 26th, 27th, and July 2nd of this month. The program is exceptionally wonderful and a rare masterpiece. Tickets can be purchased and exchanged for reserved seating at No. 6, Lane 102, Tongfu Road, telephone 34128.</p>
<p>Promoting Self-Sufficiency Policies for Refugees</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Branch on Avenue Edward VII has transformed refugees who are able to produce into self-sufficient individuals. The shelter houses are now used solely for accommodation, while all administrative expenses are still borne by the branch. The 40th shelter, located in the Tianhou Temple on North Hebei Road, is easily accessible and most refugees are capable of production. Due to the advantageous location, it is easy to find work. Last month, the branch decided to transform it into a self-sufficient shelter. However, due to objections from a small number of individuals, it has not been implemented as scheduled. Therefore, the branch has ordered the refugees to re-register and be re-allocated, and designated the area as a self-sufficient zone, ceasing relief supplies from June 24th. Fearing that various sectors may not understand the truth, the branch has sent letters to various charitable organizations explaining the situation.</p>
<p>Hope That All Sectors Will Donate Single-Layer Clothing</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Committee states that as summer approaches and the weather becomes warmer, the refugees in the various shelters urgently need single-layer clothing and straw mats. Due to limited funds, the committee is unable to provide them. They hope that all charitable individuals will generously donate them. Please send donations directly to the committee at Room 318, 3rd Floor, YMCA, 8 Immigrants' Bridge, for distribution.</p>
<p>Dinner Attendees Donate to Relief Efforts</p>
<p>The attendees of the Jiangzhe Hometown Dinner Party yesterday celebrated the birth of a great-grandson to member Zhang Jiancang of Tiantai. They all offered poems and cash as congratulations. Zhang Jiancang refused to accept anything other than the poems. Therefore, Sun Choucheng proposed using the funds as a donation to the Refugee Relief Association's Hometown Group Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association to help refugees. The association presented each donor with a longevity bowl from Ma Xiangbo in commemoration.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Japanese Troops in Daishan Forcibly Collect Salt Taxes, Salt Farmers Firmly Resist Payment, Daishan Salt Affairs Officials Have Safely Withdrawn, Landed Bandits at Tianluo Hill Have Been Repelled <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>According to shipping industry sources yesterday, since Japanese troops landed on Daishan Island, all fisheries and salt production on the entire island have been plundered. The Japanese have also started to collect "salt taxes." Salt farmers are firmly resisting payment. The bandits who landed at Tianluo Hill and Biejian Pu on Dinghai Island have been repelled after troops were dispatched to suppress them. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Daishan Salt Farmers Resist Paying Illegal Taxes</p>
<p>Japanese troops who landed on Daishan Island have long coveted the island's rich fisheries and salt production. After occupying the island, they immediately searched for salt affairs agencies and officials, attempting to force them to collect salt taxes to satisfy their desires. However, all personnel from the salt yards and weighing stations have left Daishan for Dinghai. After reporting to the Dinghai Weighing and Release Bureau, most have been temporarily assigned to Yongkang, while the remainder are temporarily staying in Dinghai to handle closing matters. It is reported that Fan Caichu has recently organized a puppet "Salt Affairs Administration" in Daishan to collect "salt taxes" of 4 jiao per dan (unit of weight) in national currency. However, the salt farmers in Daishan, understanding righteousness, firmly refuse to pay the illegal tax. In recent days, Japanese troops have also been inspecting fishing boats in nearby waters, collecting "inspection fees" of 3, 4, or 6 yuan per boat and stamping them with the words "Passed Inspection by the Great Japanese Army." At the same time, they are using force to compel fishing boats to sail to the puppet fish market in Shanghai to sell their catch at low prices and prohibiting them from transporting it to non-guerrilla areas, in order to achieve their ambition of plunder.</p>
<p>Bandits at Tianluo Hill Repelled</p>
<p>At about 10:00 PM on the 11th of this month, a large bandit ship carrying 300 to 400 bandits landed at Tianluo Hill and Biejian Pu, 20 li from Dinghai County. Local water police teams and Ding-Shen police teams rushed to the scene upon receiving reports. The bandits, seeing the police surrounding them, immediately fled to sea. At that time, Ye Maoxin, political instructor of the First Platoon of the First Detachment of the Shenjiamen Water Police Brigade, was returning to Shen from Ding on a ship when he encountered the bandits. They exchanged fire for more than ten minutes. Instructor Ye, running out of ammunition and outnumbered, jumped into the sea and drifted away with the tide. His whereabouts are still unknown. It is reported that Instructor Ye is from Suichang, Zhejiang, 31 years old, and was transferred to the First Detachment last year by order of the Department of Civil Affairs. He was known for his integrity, diligence, and effective training of the police. It is now known that the landed bandits have been repelled after troops were dispatched by the defense department.</p>

<p>Total value of exchanged instruments for the whole year reached National Currency 2,176,344,120.89 yuan, 1,423,501 bills. Compared to 1937, the amount decreased by 62.53% and the number of bills decreased by 40.60%. The daily average amount exchanged this year was National Currency 7,352,513.92 yuan, 4,809 bills.

Since the abolition of the tael and the change to yuan, the collection and settlement of funds between Chinese and foreign banks has been centered on the Bank of China. After August 13, the Bank of China moved to the western district, causing delays and procedural obstacles due to the distance. The agency collection and settlement was temporarily suspended, and each bank had no choice but to open an account with a foreign bank to receive and pay. Therefore, the same transfer of funds resulted in the distinction between the Bund transfer and the exchange transfer, which was inconvenient for the industry. The association repeatedly decided to discuss with the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications to seek improvement, and finally reached an agreement this winter. The three banks will send personnel to the association to handle the collection and settlement of funds from various industries to foreign banks. Since December 1, all bills payable to the Bund by the industry will be paid by the association and settled by the three banks, restoring the convenience of fund allocation for the industry.</p>

<p>The Dispute Over Fresh Pig Shipments to Shanghai Seems to Have a Resolution, Respecting Freedom of Operation, Goods Arrive at Customer-Selected Locations</p>
<p>Previously, the fresh pig industry was unable to freely ship fresh pigs from the Jiangbei producing area to Shanghai, and the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou arbitrarily detained them, making it impossible to do business, forcing them to suspend operations. They then accepted the advice of the concession authorities and reluctantly resumed operations, waiting for the concession authorities to provide relief measures. Yesterday, inquiries to the pig industry revealed that there are signs of a resolution regarding this matter. Fresh pigs from Jiangbei producing areas will be free to ship, Freedom of operation will be respected, goods will arrive at customer-selected locations, and there will be no more obstruction. If the above two items are realized, the industry will resume normal operations. The price of meat in the city may see a slight decrease.</p>
<p>A Drug Dealer Arrested, More Accomplices and Lots of Opium Were Soon Discovered, One of the Criminals Was Still Serving a Prison Term</p>
<p>Li Shugui, a Chinese detective in the Public Concession Narcotics Department, and detective Zhao Baosheng, based on a report from an informant on the 4th of this month, said that there was a Xiamen person, in Rong Shen, who was a drug dealer. Their head office was located in the Shanghai West Extraboundary Road, and the branch office was secretly located at 309 Yunnan Road, selling opium under the name of Hongfeng Company. The detectives then began investigating. It was not until 2:00 PM yesterday that they saw Rong Zhong carrying two paper bags, walking out of Lane 540, Foch Road. The detective followed him to the intersection of Dagu Road and Chongqing Road, stepped forward and arrested him. Upon opening the paper bags, there were five bags of opium weighing 80 taels. He was taken to the Chengdu Road Police Station. According to Wang's confession, the opium was intended to be sold by Hongfeng Company and sent to the Bund, and then taken to other ports. The detectives then accompanied Wang to No. 14, Lane 540, Foch Road, and confiscated several sheets of wrapping paper. They then went to No. 10, Lane 119, Guangxi Road, and arrested</p>

Then, six Shantou people, Weng Yongde, Zhang Aming, Ma Guisheng, Lin Jixiang, Guo Youcong, and Guo Xuanyi, were found in the attic downstairs. A scale with traces of opium was confiscated. Finally, they went to No. 309 Yunnan Road for investigation, but there was no one inside. However, the belongings were messy and the drawers were open. Judging from the appearance, it seemed that the people in the room had just left in a hurry. Only 21 yuan and 9 jiao of lottery tickets, several sheets of wrapping paper, and a sign of Hongfeng Company (with the words "Portuguese Merchant" written on it) were confiscated from the drawers and taken to the police station separately and detained. They were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case, saying that the police had not completed the investigation of the case, and it was found that Rong Shen had been sentenced to two years in prison by the Second Special Court on January 10 last year for the crime of robbery. Calculating the</p>
<p>Date of imprisonment has not expired, I don't know how it was released, further investigation is needed, Zhang Aming had been punished in opium case before, therefore, it is requested to allow custody, etc. The defendant hired a lawyer, Yu Xiangqin, for defense, and Judge Xiao Peishen ordered that the prisoners be allowed to be detained for seven days for further review, and the opium was stored in the warehouse.</p>

Cai used scientific methods to record their telephone conversations and hired lawyer Xu Jinyu to file a lawsuit against Cao in the civil division of the Special Second Court, seeking the return of a deposit of 1,200 yuan and breach of contract fees of 8,000 yuan. Presiding Judge Wu Kaoge opened the court and summoned the parties. The plaintiff brought a phonograph and recording to court and played excerpts of the</p>
<p>telephone conversation. The hearing was adjourned to a later date, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Wu held another hearing on the case. Both parties attended with their lawyers. The court first questioned the plaintiff's lawyer and the party involved. According to the defendants' representatives, lawyers Huang Zengjie and Jiang Zongpan, the defendant Cao Wenyu was working at the Japanese-owned Huili Company in March of last year when the company was selling a large quantity of wheat in Shanghai. The plaintiff learned of this and, together with the defendant and Shen Wenxin, Chen Yuanda, and others, each contributed 2,000 yuan, totaling 8,000 yuan, to establish the Yizhong Trading Company to purchase the wheat. They</p>
<p>appointed the plaintiff as manager to be responsible for the handling. Initially, Yizhong entered into a sales contract with Huili. However, due to various inconveniences in dealing directly with the Japanese company, the original contract was canceled, and a new contract was re-signed on March 14 of last year in the names of both parties. The contract stated that Party A (the defendant) had 20,000 bags of wheat, each with a net value of 7.265 yuan in national currency, to be purchased entirely by Party B (the plaintiff). Party B was to pay Party A 8,000 yuan in national currency as a deposit at the time of signing the contract. After Party B sold the goods, all net profits, after deducting all necessary expenses, were to be paid to Party A, half of which would serve as compensation for the delayed receipt of payment. The plaintiff then paid 6,000 yuan, and the defendant, in the name of Huili Company's</p>
<p>legal representative, issued a receipt to Yizhong Company. However, the actual amount received was only 3,700 yuan, as 300 yuan was deducted from the plaintiff's share and 2,000 yuan was deducted from the defendant's share. The plaintiff, in the name of Yizhong's legal representative, issued a receipt for 2,300 yuan. On March 25 of the same year, an additional 1,600 yuan was paid, and a receipt was again issued in Huili's name. On March 29, another 500 yuan was paid. Subsequently, due to the insufficient original capital of Yizhong Company, each share was increased by 833.33 yuan. On April 12 and 13 of the same year, the plaintiff paid 1,666.66 yuan and 823.33 yuan, respectively. When the first batch of 3,712 bags of goods arrived in Shanghai,</p>
<p>the plaintiff speculated and hoarded them, causing the price to fall and resulting in significant losses. Each share was estimated to have lost 879.59 yuan. If all the ordered goods were delivered, the losses would be even greater and unaffordable. Therefore, the company repeatedly negotiated with Huili to allow the delivery to be stopped. Both parties canceled the contract, settled the accounts clearly, and the plaintiff was supposed to return 679.59 yuan to the defendant. A written document was made as proof. Now, the plaintiff suddenly claims that the defendant broke the contract and filed a lawsuit, which is unreasonable. The court should investigate thoroughly and dismiss the plaintiff's claims. After verifying the statements and questioning both parties in detail about the contract's circumstances, the court adjourned the hearing to a later date for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Kind of Spending Holidays <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Mu</p>
<p>Impressions are profound in childhood. In addition to "eating," "drinking," and "playing," one must also think of "demons" and "ghosts." Thinking about it seems terrifying, but on this holiday, one seems fearless: hanging calamus swords in front of the door is not enough; one also writes the character "王" (king) on the forehead and chest with realgar wine. In this way, demons, ghosts, snakes, and insects will be scared to death or, at the very least, frightened away. This is the job in addition to wearing tassels and eating zongzi. However, all that is seen are some spiders and flies. There are no demons or ghosts. To "get acquainted" with them, one looks at the picture of Zhong Kui catching ghosts. However, the ghosts next to the big beard holding a sharp sword are especially small, suffering from malnutrition, and growing vegetables very well. So, under my innocent appreciation, I couldn't help but laugh: So that's what ghosts look like. On the one hand, I was surprised by their weakness and couldn't help but feel a little sorry for them. Zhong Kui is majestic and a little scary. In another picture, I found him funny: he can't help but dance. Looking closely, it turned out that the smallest ghost behind him was holding an umbrella for him. So I admired his boundless power even more, turning decay into magic. However, what I admired most at that time was still in the third picture: this hero's sister getting married. The little ghosts acted as "quartermasters," carrying flags and holding umbrellas, not to mention carrying her dowry.</p>
<p>Thinking about it now, it's very bland and meaningless. I have indeed seen what demons and even monsters look like now. Some of them are not worth pitying, and a certain kind of "fear" is certainly even more unnecessary. As for "admiration," I only feel ashamed. Zhong Kui's power must be discounted by 70% or 80%. For them, only destruction or eating them is the most appropriate. My flaws will arise accordingly. It's not just "favoritism" to call the quartermasters to carry the dowry. Zhong Kui may have been poor, only having a sword and broken boots. However, the regret is the same as "making ghosts push the mill." "His truth is really a dead thing." I feel some sympathy with Schiller in this situation.</p>
<p>Tennyson said, "The saddest thing in the world is to recall happy days." I really don't understand why this poet had to say it so painfully. There was certainly joy in spending holidays in childhood, but I only laugh at the simplicity of that joy. It's not that I feel the difficulty of having to repay or pay for spending holidays now. In addition to eating, drinking, and playing, the Dragon Boat Festival also has social significance. The commemoration of Qu Yuan came to be understood later. However, at present, I have some indifference to this tragic commemoration. It's natural to have one's own loneliness and anger to "help" oneself and jump into the Huangpu (or Miluo) River, but it still lacks courage. What I feel has rich social significance is still in "fighting ghosts." The fragrance of incense lingers, and the sword is elegant, but it is only the ritual of the Dragon Boat Festival, and sometimes it is not enough.</p>
<p>Eating zongzi is also a ritual, but later it became "practical." Children want meat zongzi more than bean zongzi, and they are even happier when they are divided. Thinking about it carefully now, I don't feel any pain at all. What I think is even more ridiculous: naturally, I don't have many holidays myself, and they don't seem very "practical." However, bean zongzi will not be refused, even if one does not eat meat. The worst thing is to taste cream chocolate zongzi and then just lick one's lips.</p>
<p>We are different from childhood, but it is not necessary to shout for desert-like loneliness because Eroshin doesn't hear the snake's call. Please take a look at the image of the demon saints! (Charity Donation)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Realgar Wine and Other Things <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>When I was a child, my family always had to write the character "王" (king) on my forehead with realgar wine during the Dragon Boat Festival. Perhaps it was my cleanliness, or perhaps the smell of alcohol suffocated my nose, but I always avoided this "Dragon Boat Festival makeup." However, the adults' reasons were very sufficient, saying that writing the realgar character could ward off ghosts and evil spirits. Children are always afraid of ghosts, so let the forehead suffer a little temporarily, and then when listening to stories at night or walking through the hall alone, one can be "free from all taboos."</p>
<p>Later, reading "The Legend of the White Snake," I felt that although "demons" are cultivated, they can have the "righteousness" of knowing and repaying kindness, but after drinking realgar wine, they still reveal their original form as a giant python. Realgar wine does have some effect of warding off ghosts and evil spirits.</p>
<p>Later, I didn't believe in ghosts anymore, and even in the poisonous month of May, I wouldn't think of writing the character "王" or drinking a little realgar wine.</p>
<p>Now I have reached middle age, and the shadow of ghosts is naturally even further away from me. But looking at the approach of the Dragon Boat Festival recently, I suddenly realized something. Not only did I think of the power of realgar wine to ward off ghosts and evil spirits, but also inserting a few branches of calamus at the door or burning some Atractylodes in the room seemed to contain meaning. And the image of the Jinshi Zhong Kui catching and devouring ghosts, thinking of rice, is also "very satisfying."</p>
<p>Perhaps I am thinking too fancifully, thinking about the world of ghosts, but that world is indeed full of looming shadows. (Charity Donation)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Dragon Boat Festival and People's Food <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Huai Qing</p>
<p>The Dragon Boat Festival reminds me of my childhood life.</p>
<p>My hometown is a true "farming as a profession" local farming family. The Dragon Boat Festival has a significant meaning in agriculture, and farmers attach great importance to the Dragon Boat Festival. Therefore, since the Republic of China, in order to abolish the old calendar, changing the Dragon Boat Festival on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month to "Summer Festival" is not without meaning. "Country people farm" is entirely based on the four seasons, so the old calendar is also called the lunar calendar. In the habits of farmers, if the lunar calendar is abolished, they cannot farm, so until now, farmers still adhere to the lunar calendar. It is impossible for them to change to the "solar calendar."</p>
<p>"Thirty days of yellow mildew, the Dragon Boat Festival is the beginning"; the sowing of rice to the transplanting of seedlings, of course, there are differences in the types and properties of rice due to different local conditions, but in our hometown, most of them are sown in mid-April (of course, referring to the lunar calendar) and begin to transplant seedlings in May. The dates of transplanting seedlings certainly have precedence, but the formal beginning should be said to be the Dragon Boat Festival. The yellow mildew season is the seedling transplanting period, and the formal period of the yellow mildew is thirty days, so there is this "old saying" inherited for hundreds of years, "Thirty days of yellow mildew, the Dragon Boat Festival is the beginning."</p>
<p>"Going to the fields" is the most pious etiquette for farmers and farmers. This seems to need some explanation. The agricultural affairs in my hometown are divided into two harvests of rice and wheat throughout the year. "Southern people eat rice," so people in Jiangnan mainly use rice as agricultural products, and wheat is only a by-product. Therefore, for the day of starting to plant rice, there is a most important etiquette in the farmer's home, which is the "field-entry ceremony," mostly held on the Dragon Boat Festival, which is the beginning of the thirty days of yellow mildew. At that time, the wheat has long been harvested, the rice has grown into oily green seedlings, the soil in the wheat fields has been turned over, and the cows or manpower have begun to fetch water to irrigate the fields, and then the seedling transplanting begins.</p>
<p>After eating white rice, bean paste, red beans, ham, and various kinds of zongzi and eggs in the morning of the Dragon Boat Festival (these eggs and zongzi are cooked together, and the taste is particularly fragrant), at noon, this grand ceremony of "going to the fields" is held. Large fish, meat, wine cups, big red candles, etc. are displayed on the table, and first "Lishi Bodhisattva" is sacrificed, meaning to protect the fields and rice "good weather" and "abundant autumn harvest"; and to protect the farmers from "no disaster or gloom" (gloom means bad luck) and "healthy body." The owner and Tian Gong kowtow and bow down according to their qualifications and seniority, very piously. After the sacrifice, they begin to devour this rich feast that is rare in a year. As for whether there is such a thing as "Lishi Bodhisattva," I don't know, but farmers have a belief in a "god" in any aspect.)</p>
<p>After being drunk and full, the farmers carry all kinds of newly organized farm tools and begin to go to the fields. So the Dragon Boat Festival is also an important season for people's food.</p>
<h3 id="e55">"Eating" on the Dragon Boat Festival <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Time flies, and in a few days, it will be the Dragon Boat Festival again. It is a pity that this festival has already passed a second time in the midst of turmoil, and the compatriots who are exiled on the isolated island! Although it is said that one misses one's relatives even more during every festival, it is like having a home but not being able to return!</p>
<p>Social customs, the actions of celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival, have long lost the meaning of commemorating Qu Yuan, a loyal minister who died for the country. The noble integrity and high style of thousands of years have turned into nothingness. They only enjoy Qu Yuan's glory and pay attention to eating and drinking. When the Dragon Boat Festival arrives, the first thing to eat is colorful zongzi, Cantonese zongzi, Suzhou zongzi, Ningbo zongzi... The patterns of fillings are even more beautiful and flawless; what Nan leg, jujube puree, hundred fruits, lotus seeds, red beans, shrimp, chicken, etc... It is really the ultimate in sensual pleasures, and the joy of gluttony. The second thing to eat is to open a banquet in the East Pavilion, with delicacies arranged in a row, what shark fin, sea cucumber, steamed pork with rice flour, lotus leaf chicken, roast duck, pigeon egg silver ear soup, etc... It is really a feast for the eyes, too beautiful to take in, the poor people only sigh "no meat to eat", while the rich people are still rich in meat food, how can they sympathize with the displaced, who will become starving refugees! What's more, how can they feel the environment they are in! Is it the same as those who were brutally murdered?</p>

<h3 id="e56">The Story of Eating Zongzi on the Dragon Boat Festival <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Feng</p>
<p>In recent days, zongzi advertisements have been actively appearing in newspapers, and several Cantonese food companies have lined their windows with boxes of zongzi, attracting people to buy them. Ah, it turns out that the Dragon Boat Festival on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month is approaching. Children, you must have heard that your families are about to wrap zongzi. Zongzi are an embellishment of the Dragon Boat Festival, which has become an unchanging habit, just like the fermented rice wine for the Beginning of Summer and the mooncakes for the Mid-Autumn Festival, all being necessary items for a particular season. Children, do you know the story of why we eat zongzi on the Dragon Boat Festival? It is said that zongzi are to commemorate a great poet of ancient China – Qu Yuan. Children, do you know him? I think many of you are unfamiliar with him.</p>
<p>According to "Records of the Grand Historian," a very famous historical book in China, Qu Yuan lived during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, born in 343 BC, which is more than 2,100 years ago. His name was Ping. As for his hometown and family situation, they are unknown due to the passage of time; however, it is only known that he had an older sister. From a young age, he was exceptionally intelligent, and because of his relationship with the royal family, he became an official early in life. At that time, the world was divided into many small countries, constantly conquering each other and engaging in wars. Su Qin and Zhang Yi's strategies of "vertical alliance" and "horizontal alliance" were highly praised by the kings of various countries. Qu Yuan's ancestral state was Chu, a large country in the Yangtze River basin. After becoming an official, he understood the methods of governing the country and had excellent eloquence, so he possessed political genius and was highly trusted by the king, which further enhanced his influence. Later, he was framed, eventually demoted, and exiled to other countries. Deeply resenting his unfortunate fate, he threw himself into the Miluo River and died when he was about fifty years old. His greatest contribution in life was the creation of Chu poetry, which marked the beginning of southern Chinese literature. His most famous work is "Li Sao," but unfortunately, it is not easy for children to understand. He died on the Dragon Boat Festival, so people commemorate him with zongzi. This is a very special custom in China, which is not found in foreign countries. After the death of great foreign poets, memorial monuments are often erected to commemorate them, while China uses zongzi to commemorate an ancient great poet, which might make Qu Yuan, who is sleeping peacefully underground, feel unhappy.</p>
<p>I hope that children will not forget the great poet of ancient China – Qu Yuan – when they eat zongzi.</p>
<p>“Pigs” are having the same fate!</p>
<p>In short, "eating" during the Dragon Boat Festival is a popular season of feasting in Chinese society. In addition to the aforementioned zongzi and delicacies, there is also heavy drinking of whisky, brandy, wine, and Shaoxing wine, and gorging on soda, beer, loquats, and lychees. After the banquet is over, a cup of coffee, cocoa, or pre-Qingming tea and chrysanthemum tea adds to the fun! It is truly carefree and enjoyable, forgetting all worries.</p>

<p>The pomegranate flowers on the branches are red, and the calamus leaves in the pond are green. In this bright and refreshing wilderness, a harmonious and beautiful picture is interwoven, indicating that we have now entered the summer season. The Dragon Boat Festival in summer has always been known as a good time and a happy festival, with many interesting stories remaining. "Dragon boat racing" is one of them. People often like to bring their lovers or children to watch, as if they are attending a grand event, with great enthusiasm, regardless of the distance or the hardships of the journey.</p>
<p>If we examine the original intention of dragon boat racing on the Dragon Boat Festival, it was not a seasonal entertainment, but because later generations passed it down, they lost its original meaning. According to the records of the annual customs of Jingchu: "Qu Yuan threw himself into the Miluo River on the fifth day of the fifth month, so Wuling organized dragon boat races on this day to summon him. The Tang people regarded the third day of the third month as the Soul Summoning Festival." Also, the Tang History records: "In the second year of the Baoli era (826 AD), the emperor visited the Fish and Algae Palace to watch dragon boat races." It is not known whether this was an entertainment performance in the palace to commemorate Qu Yuan? However, I dare say that the current dragon boat racing is entirely recreational, used to embellish the Dragon Boat Festival, and no one remembers the tragic page created by Qu Yuan (Daifu) for the country.</p>
<p>Dragon boat racing is very popular in several provinces in Jiangnan. In times of peace, those who are fond of it are indeed exuberant and spirited, and the boats are decorated very beautifully with elaborate designs. Taking the dragon boat festival in Shanghai as an example, I vaguely recall going to the Bansong Garden in southern Shanghai for a dragon boat race about seven or eight years ago. I seem to remember that the race was organized by a certain company and was of a commercial nature. The company specially hired famous craftsmen from Nanxiang to make two dragon boats, one with a green dragon body and the other with a white dragon body. The edges of the boats were decorated with colorful flags and umbrellas, which were colorful and very pleasing to the eye. They swayed back and forth on the lake pavilion in the garden (but not racing). At the same time, drums and gongs were beating on the boats, which was very lively. Moreover, a person was standing tall at the bow of the boat, with a short and fat figure, holding a banana fan in his hand, and his costume was also very unique. His upper body was completely naked, and his lower body was wearing colorful pants. He was dancing and gesticulating non-stop following the rhythm of the gongs and drums, which was quite a spectacle! But I don't know what the meaning of this dancer was. There were indeed many spectators in the garden at that time, and the grand occasion is still worth reminiscing. Since then, Shanghai seems to have not held such a grand event. Nowadays, the country is facing serious national difficulties, and the whole country is working hard for national survival and fighting the sacred war of resistance, so there is no time to talk about this dragon boat racing game. Moreover, the maritime environment is special, and I heard that the Bansong Garden in Nanshi has been almost completely destroyed! Recalling the scenic spots, I truly cannot help but feel the changes of the past and present!</p>

<h3 id="e58">Finance: Rumors of Suspension of Foreign Exchange Supply, Cash Reaches Unprecedented High Price of $2,702.50; Frenzied Buying; Large Accounts Emerge: Rumors Difficult to Believe Ultimately <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>In the early trading of spot silver, the situation remained unchanged. Although Hong Kong brokers entrusted money changers and some silver shops to absorb it, and some gold shops acted as speculators with more inflows than outflows, securities firms acted as brokers for northern clients with strong selling intentions. The silver shops and retail investors also supplied somewhat, resulting in extremely mediocre fluctuations. The sudden rise in the afternoon was due to rumors in the market that HSBC would suspend the supply of sixpence and a half for British gold and $12.625 for US dollars next Monday, as well as other rumors. This led to general speculation in the market, and all kinds of groundless claims were widely spread, resulting in rampant buying. Therefore, the market situation was extremely chaotic, and it was difficult to find sellers for a while. The price opened at $75 higher, soaring to $2,670. After the opening, although some gold shops tended to unload profits, the buyers still poured in, causing the price to rise again and again, breaking through the $2,700 mark and reaching an unprecedented new high of $2,702.50. Later, due to active selling by limit-price sellers and retail investors taking profits, the rising trend was immediately curbed, and it reversed downward. As a result, it closed at $2,680, a sharp increase of $90 from the previous day. The difference between the highs and lows was also large, reaching $112.50. Trading was brisk, reaching 1,700 to 1,800 taels. Silver jewelry also rose first and then fell, resulting in a net increase of $7. The Shanghai General Association of Silver Shops created an unprecedented record of $274. The customs gold did not change. British and Chinese pure gold continued to rise.</p>
<p>Spot Silver Rises Sharply by $90</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar of ten taels opened firm. The opening at 9:48 a.m. immediately rose by $5. A certain gold shop, acting for speculators, absorbed 50 taels each from money changers and securities firms at a price of $2,595. At that time, the securities firms still had strong selling intentions, and the price fell slightly, dropping $3 in an instant. The securities firms sold 50 taels to a certain silver shop at a price of $92. Then, the securities firms and silver shops sold a total of 100 taels to a certain gold shop acting for speculators at a price of $90. Subsequently, the selling intentions of the securities firms weakened, and it rose again. The money changers bought 50 taels from a certain silver shop at a price of $91, which was the closing price for the morning. In the afternoon, the rising trend suddenly intensified due to various rumors in the market and rising buying sentiment. Some retail investors also increased their positions, and everyone scrambled to buy, with the shouting shaking the outdoors. The intensity of the rising trend was unprecedented. The opening at 2:20 p.m. was up $75, and the money changers traded 50 taels at a price of $2,670. After the opening, buyers poured in, and although a certain gold shop (acting for speculators) unloaded profits in large quantities, it was still difficult to curb the momentum. The price soared by another $30, breaking through the $2,700 mark. A silver shop congratulated a money changer on 50 taels, with the price reaching an unprecedented high of $2,702.50 (a difference of $32 from the British gold closing price and a difference of $79 from the US dollar closing price). At that time, sellers with a limit price of $700 poured in, and the selling intentions of a certain gold shop remained strong. At the same time, retail investors also took profits and sold heavily, causing the market to become even more chaotic, and the price fell sharply. A certain gold shop sold 50 taels to a money changer at a price of $665. After that, the market sentiment turned upward again, and it rebounded. At 3:45 p.m., a money changer bought 50 taels from a gold shop at $2,680, which was the closing price for the evening. As a result, it rose sharply by $90 compared to the previous day's evening close (with a fluctuation of $112.50 for the whole day). It was heard that the market sentiment was slightly weak after the close, and the speculators had shouted to sell at a low of $2,670, but there was still no one to take it. The selling price of the gold shops' own brand of gold was $10 higher than that of spot silver, and the current bid price was $50 lower than the listed gold price. According to inquiries, there were few open positions.</p>
<p>Silver Jewelry Association Responds with $274</p>
<p>The buying and selling price of silver jewelry per tael did not change in the morning due to the mediocre fluctuations of spot silver. At 2 p.m., spot silver suddenly rose sharply, opening up $75, causing the listed price to jump $7 at 2:30 p.m. Ten minutes later, it rose another $4. At that time, the Da Tong Association suspended the unprecedented record of $274. At 2:47 p.m., because spot silver fell slightly after rising, it also fell back $4. After that, there were no changes. The Da Tong Association changed its suspension to $270, the New Association to $268, and the buying price to $262.</p>
<p>British Pure Gold Rises Another Penny</p>
<p>London, 16th (Reuters) – British pure gold rose another penny per ounce due to the weakening of the pound, reaching £7 8s 6½d. The Chinese cash buying price of the Central Bank also rose to $1,212.30. The listed customs gold price remained unchanged at $2.396. The Shanghai standard bid price also rose by 7 cents, reaching $1,207.60.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Foreign Exchange Results Remain Stable, HSBC's Supply Weakens at Noon <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The black market for British and American foreign exchange was also quite mediocre. Although foreign firms intervened in the middle, foreign banks such as HSBC were willing to maintain supply. However, at noon, the willingness to supply weakened, causing the previously strong American foreign exchange to finally tighten. As a result, there were no gains or losses. Trading was sluggish during the day, and arbitrage trading was still lively. Interest rates remained the same as yesterday, with banks offering to pay US$0.1875 for June to July (monthly interest of 1.5%), while only offering US$0.15625 (monthly interest of just over 1.2%) to Chinese merchants. The Hong Kong exchange rate was relatively stable and ultimately remained unchanged.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the recent large contracts in London shrank by 0.125, and the forward contracts fell by 0.1875. The silver price in New York was flat, the price of raw gold in London rose by one penny, and the exchange rates of British to American rose by 5 points, while the rates to Shanghai and France remained flat. The US exchange rate rose by 0.0615 against the British, while remaining flat against Shanghai and France. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The banks' opening spot selling prices in the morning were 6.5 pence for British exchange and $12.625 for American exchange, both of which were flat compared to the previous close. After the opening, although foreign firms intervened, foreign banks were still willing to maintain the rates, so there was little change. Foreign firms first bought HSBC's spot British gold at 6 pence 11/16 and then bought a certain bank's spot US dollars at $12.625. It was heard that the July rate was slightly soft to 6 pence 31/64 and US$12.3125. When HSBC announced that it would not change the prices and the white silver balancing tax was revealed to be slightly over half, with a levy of 3.50%, Chinese speculators also came to buy spot British gold. Dong Gao speculators bought spot British gold from foreign banks at 6 pence 46875. After that, arbitrage trading was frequent, but foreign banks mostly offered to sell. However, the monthly interest rates were the same as yesterday. Near noon, it was heard that HSBC's willingness to supply was not as good as in the past few days, and other banks also had little intention of selling. There were only transactions in Hong Kong exchange, with foreign firms buying Anda spot prices at $43.75, which was also flat. Until the afternoon close, the banks' spot selling prices were 6 pence and 1/8 for British gold and $12.625 for American exchange, both of which were unchanged from the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was flat based on the transaction price, with no changes. In the afternoon, the market was closed on Saturday.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Gold Pounds are Good, Scavenging is Strong <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold rose by 1 penny, and the exchange rate between British and American currencies fell by 0.0625. In this port's foreign exchange market, foreign firms were very active in settling payments, and foreign banks were still providing ample supply. The market price was stable. At the noon close, there were rumors that HSBC would stop supplying foreign exchange. The spot silver market opened on Saturday with a fairly firm market situation, $5 higher than the previous day. After entering the market, supply and demand were evenly matched, and fluctuations were minimal. The market stabilized at the noon close. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market situation suddenly tightened. It was heard that HSBC Bank's supply of drafts was not smooth at the noon close, and there were fears that the foreign exchange market would change on Monday. Gold shops' buying intentions suddenly became active, and buying from northern firms and retail investors became stronger. The market price reached $2,670, and supply was scarce, with a high of $702.50. After three days of stability, the market trend returned to rising. In the late trading session, speculators unloaded, and the market price rebounded slightly, resulting in $2,680, a sharp increase of $85 from the previous day. Demand in the black market was quite strong, and it was difficult to buy at the retail limit of $2,720. Due to the sharp rise in spot silver, demand for foreign currencies such as British and American gold pounds suddenly increased. Trading in British and American gold notes was quite active, and the market price was already higher than the listed price of drafts, and it was still not easy to obtain them. Hong Kong notes, French franc notes, and Dutch guilder notes were all in short supply, and they all showed sharp increases. The Japanese yen note market was stable, and the price was on par with the legal tender. Korean notes also did not change and remained at 8 angles and 5%. There was not much trading in the association. Baoxiang offered Taijin Annam notes at 100 yuan, Qintai offered Shixiang American dollar notes at 200 yuan, and Rentai offered Qintai British gold notes at 100 pounds. Yesterday's market prices were: British gold pound up $2, British gold note up $1.05, American gold pound up $2.10, American gold note up $0.24, Hong Kong note up 0.035, French franc note up 0.004, Singapore note up $0.09, Dutch guilder note up $0.10, Annam note up $0.12, Robi note up $0.03, Canadian note up $0.28, Philippine note up $0.10, Italian lira note up $0.01, Australian gold note up $0.70, only the German gold mark election ticket did not change.</p>
<p>Discount and Call Loan Rates Turn Upward in Unison</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for HSBC drafts first decreased and then increased, with the rate per thousand yuan once falling to $51.25 in the morning, but soon rebounding. The noon rate was $51.75, and the afternoon rate was even higher at $52, a further increase of $0.25 from the previous day. The call loan rate for the money industry also increased by 2 cents, a further increase of 0.03% from the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Securities: London Far East Securities Plummet, Shanghai Foreign Stocks See Slight Rebound - Will It Last? <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The securities black market was firm yesterday morning and weak in the afternoon. The superficial form seemed to have a chance of continuing to rebound slightly, but the bulls did not give up pulling up the market. In the afternoon, rumors spread about the tense situation in Tianjin, which did not shake the bulls' defenses, but a certain account wanted to buy foreign exchange and sell hundreds of thousands of public bonds to facilitate turnover. This caused the floating bulls among the retail investors to cut their losses, and the market price rebounded by a small number of cents. According to what we heard, the most confident thing for the bulls is to pull up the market again.</p>
<p>If the current situation lasts for more than ten days, the bears will have to cover their positions due to the payment of half-year interest. It is also believed that the Tianjin incident will not spread to Shanghai. Therefore, short-term bearishness and long-term bullishness are the general psychology of the market. Fortunately, the period is not long. When the short-term and long-term interests clash, there will be huge changes. Yesterday, the market price first rose firmly and then weakened, resulting in a slight improvement of about 1 cent. The initial increase was due to the buying of Tiansheng and Yuan, and the subsequent weakening was due to the simultaneous selling of Datong. After that, there were fewer transactions, and the market was stable. In the afternoon, there were sudden rumors, and many scalpers shorted the market. This was mostly due to the heavy selling of Shunheng. The Class C shares broke through the $4 mark again. Later, because Qiafeng, Hongkang, Xieda, Tiansheng, Hengfu, and the 5-cent shares were all in demand, the market price stabilized slightly. It is expected that the market will hover around $4 for a while. Overall, the market price resulted in small gains of 3.5 cents to 5.5 cents. There were still no transactions at $0.96. The total number of transactions was in the order of 800,000. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>There were no stock transactions. The stock price of Great China Match Company was quoted at $12.20, but there were no sellers.</p>
<p>Public Association of Various Industries: When the market opened yesterday morning, everyone expected the market to be as miserable as it was on Friday. Unexpectedly, there was a joyous atmosphere in the market, and a new round of trading began. Jardine Matheson's stock led the way, and the price continued to rise, reaching $20.08. This was followed by a rebound, and the price fell slightly to a buying price of $20.03 and a selling price of $20.04 when the closing bell rang. The market sentiment and rubber stock prices of various stocks followed the same trend. Generally, the prices were higher than the previous day. Near the close, the market sentiment became uneasy again, and the prices rebounded slightly. There are often unexpected events in the market, such as the current situation in Tianjin and anything that may happen, which makes it impossible to accurately calculate investors' regulations. There is a close relationship between the devaluation of the currency and the value of stocks. Rubber stocks are a special case, and if the political situation can be stabilized, these stocks will move first and return to their correct value.</p>
<p>London British Merchants' Far East Company Stock Prices on the 16th of this month (Friday) - The downward trend was quite strong. The price of Mercantile Bank shares fell 2s 6d to £7 10s. The price of HSBC London-registered shares fell another £3 to £78, and the price of Hong Kong-registered shares fell another £1 10s to £81. The price of Kaiping Mining bearer shares fell another 6d to 19s. There were no other changes.</p>
<p>London Chinese Overseas Chinese on the 16th of this month (Friday) - The prices of bonds at the upper end fell sharply. The price of British-French loans and British-issued bonds fell £5 to £45. The price of British-German continuous loans and British-issued bonds and the price of Chinese-French US$50 million bonds fell £3. The former was priced at £56, and the latter was priced at £55. The price of Shanhou loans and British-issued bonds fell £1 to £39. The price of Crisp bonds fell half a pound to £25. Railway bonds were generally stable, with only the original continuous issue of Tianjin-Pukou Railway falling another £1 to £14. There were no other changes.</p>
<p>There is also a rubber stock dividend.</p>
<p>Taiping Rubber Co., Ltd., managed by Cheung Mao Foreign Firm in this port, has recently announced its operating conditions for the last year (from April 1, 1938, to March 31, 1939). The profit was $132,827.31 in national currency, with a total of $154,824.41 in national currency including the previous year's retained earnings. In addition to the interim dividend of 3 cents per share in national currency that was already paid on November 25 of last year, a final dividend of 5 cents per share in national currency was paid. The total annual dividend was 8 cents per share in national currency. After deducting various amortizations, the net surplus of $25,371.92 in national currency will be carried forward to the next year. It was decided at this year's shareholders' meeting to hold it on July 7.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Grain: Rice Prices Rise More Wildly; Common Japonica Rice Sold at $20.40; Customer's Xian Rice Also Has Active Outlets <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Du Japonica Rice: Since the price has been soaring all the way this week, the rising trend was even more intense yesterday. The main reasons are that the sources from all over are affected and the rough local market has risen sharply after the closing price of foreign rice. Yesterday's source from the river was still blocked by a certain party in Minhang, and it has not been relaxed, and there is no arrival. The goods arriving from the Suzhou and Tongzhou gangs are also decreasing day by day, only two or three thousand four hundred packages. Therefore, the rising trend was even more intense when the market opened in the early morning. One party's hoarders are coming in, and the sellers are raising prices. At the same time, there is also decoration in this street, causing the market to rise by more than half a yuan in an instant. For example, common japonica rice shouted a price of $21, and then actually sold for $20.40. The other types, such as thick and thin japonica rice, were also chaotic, rising step by step by four, five, six, or seven cents.</p>
<p>Customer Xian Rice: The rising trend started in the morning. Due to the high price, the domestic gang and the hoarders are not as greedy as they were a few days ago. However, the retail sales in this street are active, and they are absorbing it one after another. Loose households such as factories are also quite prosperous. High Customer Xian Rice is favored by this street because Yang Du Jian has risen sharply. Therefore, High Beijing Xian opened at $17.20, and High Wu Xian opened at $17. The selling was quite sufficient, but it rose by three, four, or five cents compared to the previous market. 5,600 packages were traded. Du Yang Jian and Port Customer Jian showed the same beauty.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: The price has been high, and retail sales have gradually decreased. However, hoarders continue to ask for it. Therefore, the price was once bargained to $22.50 in the morning market. As a result, the hoarders took 500 packages at a price of $21.70.</p>
<p>Chang Yuan: The outlet is not smooth, and it is only slightly better by two or three cents.</p>
<p>North Sales Stagnate, Foreign Noodles Suffer, Wheat Hoarders Have Inward Sales</p>
<p>The trend of the noodle market is still sluggish. Retail sales in this port are sporadic, but not very lonely. However, the large sales route to North China has been affected by the Tianjin concession incident, and it is difficult to expand for a while. Therefore, in the midst of the soaring rice prices, the market failed to rise step by step. The second-grade flour for this port is still calling out for $8.80. The trend of foreign noodles has been weak. The reason is that sales in the north have stagnated, and the South Ocean gang is paying attention to factory noodles. Yesterday, it was heard that Lantern Brand and God of Wealth Brand were priced at $4.80, while consumers were only at a little over 70 cents. There were not many sellers, and there were few buyers. The market is still in a state of holding on.</p>
<p>The source of wheat is constantly arriving, mostly from the Nanjing area. Since the Shantou gang of customers once moved out the goods the day before yesterday, the intention of holding the goods is even firmer. Therefore, the supply in the market is still scarce. Muke hoarders are still greedy, causing the market to continue to be firm. It was heard that there were 400 to 500 packages of Kunshan new wheat traded in the after-hours market at a price of $6.70. There were also 200 to 300 packages of Nanjing old wheat traded at a price of $6.50, all of which were taken away by hoarders from this port. On the 18th, 500 packages of bran will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Silk and Tea. A Portion of Zhejiang Silk Can Be Shipped, But External Costs Are Huge, and Tea Prices Frequently Reach New Highs <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have completed the collection of raw silk cocoons one after another, but transportation is still a problem. Recently, it was heard that after the efforts of merchants and officials, 16,000 piculs of dried raw silk east of Linping have been approved for free transport. The Hangzhou area is still under negotiation. It is said that in addition to the required water freight, transportation costs, and taxes, the above-mentioned dry silk for export also requires the payment of handling fees in seven aspects, with a cost of 40 yuan per picul. Therefore, although the price of raw silk in Zhejiang is low, the cost of silk will also be considerably raised after adding these expenses. It is also reported that 17,000 piculs of dry silk in Jiangsu Province, close to the Yangtze River area, have been transported to this port by a third-party force, but have not yet been successful. However, there are still more than 50,000 piculs of silk cocoons stranded in Jiangsu and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>In the foreign tea market, a total of more than 560 boxes of various grades of tea, such as "Chouxin Zhenmei" (bud-pluck eyebrow tea), were traded. The highest selling price of "Chouxin" reached 305 yuan, setting a new record high. The selling price of "Zhenmei" (eyebrow tea) also increased from 215 yuan to 235 yuan. The strength of the market is unprecedented. On the 18th, 21 boxes of tea were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Oilseed Cakes. Soybean Oil Market. Tension Returns</p>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean oil market was full of bullish sentiment. Firstly, credit tightened; secondly, there were rumors of a suspension of foreign exchange supply; and thirdly, certain provocative rumors caused anxiety. Market prices rose steadily. "Kobe" brand bonded oil opened at 44.9 yuan and rose to 46.4 yuan, with over 1,200 barrels traded. "Tianjin" canned oil was 32.5 yuan, frequently rising to 33 yuan, with 1,240 cans traded. "Jiaozhou" oil was 32 yuan, rising to 33 yuan, with 350 pieces opened. "Yanqi" oil opened at 200 pieces, with prices ranging from 32.8 yuan to 33.5 yuan. "Qingqi" oil traded at 150 pieces, with prices ranging from 32.4 yuan to 33.4 yuan.</p>
<p>On the 18th, 90 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Shantou, 220 pieces of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong, 1,855 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong, and 650 bags were shipped to Shantou.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Piece Goods. Cotton Cloth Market. Sudden Tightening in the Afternoon. Eastern Cloth Fills Needs and National Cloth <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the cotton cloth market saw flat and sluggish selling. In the afternoon, sentiment turned bullish due to the sharp rise in gold and changes in foreign exchange rates. Throughout the day, coarse cloth fell by five cents in the morning but rebounded by ten cents in the afternoon. The opening prices of fine cloth and fine twill all rose uniformly. Wholesale dealers on this street purchased more than 100 bales of coarse cloth, the Wenzhou gang purchased 50 to 60 bales, and speculators purchased more than 200 bales of Ewo and Dasheng coarse cloth. Dyeing factories on this street purchased more than 100 bales of fine twill cloth. The Yunnan parcel post has been gradually cleared, and imports have increased slightly. More than 1,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and fine twill were traded. The Zhejiang and Guangdong gangs added several hundred boxes of colored twill, serge, broadcloth, and colored cloth, and imports remained strong. The price of colored cloth and colored twill increased by one to two dimes per piece.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>White goods, fine cloth, and fine twill saw selling prices rise gradually from morning to night, with the bullish trend intensifying. This was due to the frequent contraction of foreign exchange and the sharp rebound in yarn prices. Outside speculators also came to buy, and short sellers in the industry panicked and eagerly sought to cover their positions. Therefore, the situation in the afternoon market was very tense. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth closed at a peak of 15 yuan this month, a huge jump of six to seven dimes compared to the previous day's market. There were not many fine twill futures transactions, with each piece rising by about three dimes. Actual sales to customers were scarce. The Tianjin gang was still selling, but the sentiment and business of local industry players and speculators were very lively. The total volume of transactions for fine cloth and fine twill, both spot and futures, reached around 3,000 pieces.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>On the 18th, piece goods exports included 190 pieces to Haiphong, 22 pieces to Beihai, 70 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 135 pieces to Zhenggang, and 805 pieces to Shantou. There were also nine boxes of woolen yarn shipped to Haiphong.</p>
<p>Sugar Market. National Sugar High and Fine, Secondary Flat</p>
<p>Yesterday, the London sugar market saw slight improvements, with August at 6 shillings, 11 and 75/100 pence, December unchanged, and March at 6 shillings, 1 and 75/100 pence. The Dutch telegram showed a small return, with September at 7.7 yuan. The Guild's closing price made the market trend flat and soft. There were no transactions for spot goods at the original price. 1,000 bags of re-exported goods were traded, with road goods at 21 yuan and bonded warehouse goods at 20.8 yuan, each at 500 bags. There were no transactions for Taikoo sugar. However, the trading of national sugar saw a significant improvement, with high-quality goods selling particularly well. The Chaozhou gang opened 180 bags of high-quality Huanggang Qing (green sugar), priced at 15.5 yuan, 200 bags of Bannan at 14 yuan, and 80 bags of Longjiang Qing, priced at 13.5 yuan.

<h3 id="e66">Yarn and Cotton. Gold Continues to Rise, Cotton Yarn Rises Straight Up. 20s Double Horse Reaches 507 Yuan. A Huge Jump of 25 Yuan in One Day <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>After two days of sluggishness, the yarn market suddenly turned upwards yesterday, and the bullish trend intensified again. This was because the market sentiment was uniformly bullish, and the lifting force became uncontrollable at the slightest opportunity. In the afternoon, rumors resurfaced that gold continued to rise and the Hong Kong dollar was fluctuating. Buying sentiment suddenly rose, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. The gold dealers suddenly came to buy unlimited amounts of yarn, and the price soared straight up in an instant, breaking through the 500 yuan barrier. This kind of frantic state is rare in the history of the yarn industry. The highest price for 20s Double Horse yarn reached 507 yuan, a new record, surpassing last year's peak price. It was found that Double Horse rose five yuan in the morning and jumped twenty yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<p>In the morning, the opening price of 20s Double Horse spot yarn was 480 yuan, with the Hong Kong gang buying 75 bales and then 40 bales at 81 yuan. The warehouse receipt price was still 476 yuan. After a short while, buyers crowded in, and a major dealer came to buy again. The market suddenly became tight, and prices gradually advanced. By closing, the price of 20s Double Horse yarn at the outer warehouse was 87.5 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 78.5 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon rose by three or four yuan due to someone buying, with the warehouse receipt price at 80 yuan and the spot price at 90 yuan. In an instant, buyers came from all directions, and brokers gathered, all with buying orders. The momentum was huge, and market order was disrupted as if there was a yarn shortage. The difficulty of buying cotton yarn was evident, with the market jumping horizontally between five and ten yuan. However, customer gangs, aware of the situation, remained inactive, and the purchases were mainly made by local industry players and financially strong individuals. The price of 20s Double Horse gradually rose, and the final price was raised to 507 yuan at closing. According to statistics, various gangs bought a total of 2,440 bales throughout the day, and 1,790 bales were traded among peers. The market price of 20s Double Horse rose 25 yuan, Shepherd Boy rose 18 yuan, Five Blessings rose 14 yuan, Double Globe rose 22 yuan, and 10s coarse yarn rose more than 10 yuan. Today, cotton yarn exports included 825 pieces to You Tou, 880 pieces to Hong Kong, 100 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 590 pieces to Beihai, and 80 pieces to Haiphong. A list of the amount purchased by each gang is shown on the left.</p>
<p>The need for Japanese yarn is quiet and dormant, but the market sentiment is bullish, generally taking the same steps as local yarn. The morning closing price of 20s Yueqin yarn was 407 yuan, and it jumped horizontally by 10 yuan in the afternoon, with a closing price of 418 yuan.</p>

<p>The foreign cotton market in New York was very quiet yesterday, and market conditions were extremely narrow. Most industry players are waiting for the development of agricultural relief funds from Washington, hoping that this relief fund can be resolved next week. Yesterday's closing prices in New York fell two or three pounds, Indian linked predictions fell three rupees, and Egyptian rose five or six pounds.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, rumors arose again in the foreign exchange market near noon yesterday, and the exchange rate was once again chaotic. Cotton yarn broke through the 500 yuan barrier again, and foreign cotton prices soared. Trading among industry players was quite lively. Yesterday's transactions totaled more than 3,000 pieces, deeply satisfying all parties. Foreign cotton prices will not fall temporarily.</p>
<p>The production of local cotton is completely blocked, but Indian cotton trading among industry players is unusually frequent. These transactions are mostly resold to Japanese factories. The amount of spot transactions among industry players totaled 1,600 pieces. Huashang Xinyu Factory imported 1,400 pieces of Indian cotton 20s raw material, and the spot goods were sent to the factory. Other factories have not taken action. The market price is still advancing. The supply from northern Jiangsu is only 107 bales from Tongzhou. Today, 50 pieces were exported to Hong Kong. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Tinplate. When the selling prices of 200-pound double-speed American goods were raised in all markets, the rise of these goods was the most dramatic due to the good market situation. Recently, customer gangs and industry players have been competing to buy, and local factories (such as thermos bottles, iron printing, machine workers, canning, etc.) have a strong need. Standards have therefore soared, and it seems that it will not be easy to get goods at less than 102 or 103 yuan. In addition, the inventory in this port is not abundant, and the holders are reluctant to let go easily.</p>
<p>New Lead Wire. The Tianjin gang has always been the largest seller in the market. Recently, due to the Japanese blockade of the concession, the market has been chaotic, and the enthusiasm of customer gangs to purchase goods is not what it used to be. However, other gangs and local factories are still buying tirelessly, so the market is still booming, and the inventory is weak, causing the standard to rise more than double compared to the previous market. For example, medium-grade goods are priced at 61 or 62 yuan, coarse grades sell for 65 yuan, and fine grades require 75 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e70">The Safety Campaign's Conversation Starter <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Meng</p>
<p>The Municipal Council hires storytellers to give lectures in small teahouses and schools in rotation.</p>
<p>A long-standing habit, which has disappeared from the lives of Chinese people in Shanghai, but since 1923, when the Public Concession's Municipal Council hired a storyteller, He Dingfu (transliteration), to promote road safety to pedestrians in Shanghai, this habit has taken on a new purpose.</p>
<p>At that time, the people of Shanghai were beginning to realize that cars were toothless tigers, but the number of cars suddenly increased. Because most people in Shanghai were not prepared for the impact of high-speed cars, the number of accidents also increased rapidly with the increase in cars. The responsible personnel of the Traffic Department, after studying the causes of the accidents, decided that pedestrians should only be allowed to walk on the cement sidewalks beside the roads, and coolies dragging heavy goods should also not be allowed to walk on the main car lines.</p>
<p>Few people today may remember how storytelling was initially used in the safety campaign. But the people in charge of guiding safety have realized that this method is the most effective way to improve pedestrian safety. It is only regrettable that there are still raging vehicles coming and going, and pedestrians, in Shanghai's rapidly modernizing city, should adjust themselves to suit a new urban life.</p>
<p>When Mr. He joined the Traffic Department, people were not unfamiliar with him when he told stories at the selected locations, because he had been known for many years in the small teahouses and alleys near his residence for his good storytelling.</p>
<p>After taking on the new position, he continued to tell stories of impulsive emotions to frighten the audience. He would tell the story of Xiang Yu's suicide at Wujiang, causing the audience to weep; he would tell the legends from Journey to the West, making the audience laugh; tell the story of Dream of the Red Chamber, softening their hearts; or tell the story of Cao Cao's betrayal in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, arousing their anger.</p>
<p>Then, at the end, he would say to the audience: "Everyone. When you cross the road, you must think of your own safety. Cars are the most dangerous things, even more dangerous than the east wind that overturned Cao Cao's giant ships. You must be careful."</p>
<p>Now let's take a look at how this method is carried out. Zhu Qin (transliteration) is Mr. He's replacement, telling stories to forty people in a small teahouse on Chengqi Road.</p>
<p>"Now, everyone!" he said, "You are all familiar with the stories of the Wei, Shu, and Wu kingdoms. The Shu army has a hundred thousand soldiers, led by the world-renowned, resourceful, and brave Guan Yunchang. Cao Cao, the leader of Wei, harbors the ambition to annex the world, and his military advisor Pang De lends him a large army to fight against the Shu army on the western front. Pang De's courage is irreproachable, and his will is even more resolute. When he went to the battlefield, he carried a coffin, saying that it would either be Guan Gong or him, and he would never return alive.</p>
<p>"After several days of bloody battles, the casualties on both sides were heavy, and the blood that flowed could truly form a river. The equipment of both sides was very good, and they were well-trained. Guan Yunchang decided that the victory of the battle depended on brainpower, not brawn. After considering the situation on the battlefield, he decided on a new strategy.</p>
<p>"The next day, he led his army back to the edge of the Han River, below a very deep valley, some distance from the front line. From a general point of view, he was retreating. This action was immediately transmitted to Pang De's side and Pang De's headquarters. Chase immediately! he issued the order. At the same time, Guan Yunchang ordered his army to retreat again. When the Wei army occupied the new stronghold, he used lightning speed to breach a dike not far away, and the water poured into the low-lying area, and the Wei army was all swept into the Han River.</p>
<p>"How many people died in this great battle is unknown. However, everyone, this danger is not limited to the battlefield. If you do not pay attention to traffic rules, you are always in danger of death or injury. In Shanghai, there are many vehicles of all kinds traveling on the busy roads. Many pedestrians, it seems, do not know that the cement sidewalks beside the roads are specially designed for the safety of pedestrians. On the contrary, they risk death and walk in the middle of the road where cars and horses are mixed. Just think that life is precious, and you will die or be injured due to carelessness. Moreover, even if you do not die, the law will still fine you for disobeying traffic rules."</p>
<p>The number of storytellers hired by the Traffic Department has increased to two since 1925. Every morning, they go to various places to tell stories. Each person, together with a Chinese policeman designated by the police station, patrols and tells stories according to a map. Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, after refugees gathered, the number of pedestrians suddenly increased, and they often went to refugee shelters to tell stories and promote road safety.</p>
<p>However, the storytellers prefer to gather only forty or fifty people for each lecture. According to Mr. Zhu, it is not easy to have personal contact when there are too many people, and the opportunity to promote road safety is lost. In short, this method is to make the general audience understand, because it depends entirely on personal interest to make pedestrians aware of their own safety.</p>
<p>In addition to teahouses and refugee shelters, storytellers often go to public schools, especially at the beginning of each semester. And they have found that young students are the most likely to obey them. Experience has also shown that young students, after hearing the traffic rules, not only walk according to the rules themselves, but also urge the adults at home to do the same.</p>
<p>In this way, what was initially very simple, the Traffic Department's method of using storytellers has had a good effect on road safety. The statistics for 1926 showed that 50,000 people listened to the lectures throughout the year; in 1936, it had increased to 70,000; but since 1938, a large number of refugees poured into the concession, and the number of listeners jumped to 113,000, which means that 2,200 people listened to the lectures every week.</p>
<p>Although there are no accurate statistics on what kind of effect this oral propaganda has on the ability of pedestrians to cooperate and reduce traffic accidents, it is undeniable that it at least makes the audience aware of road safety. Propaganda in newspapers seems insufficient because there are too many illiterate people. Traffic rules and various regulations, in order to be effective, also depend on the level of knowledge of each pedestrian and how well they understand the law, so they are equally insufficient.</p>
<p>The same effective method has been adopted by another part of the Municipal Council, the Police Department. Since 1926, the Police Department has also hired a storyteller, who rotates through each police station to tell stories and promote road safety in the same way. He works in the same way as his colleagues in the Traffic Department, going in and out of teahouses, shelters, and schools, seeking to reduce traffic accidents and for pedestrians to obey traffic regulations. —Translated from the Mainland News Weekly—</p>
<h3 id="e71">Impressions of "Stablemates" <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"Stablemates"</p>
<p>Produced by MGM, Showing at the Nanjing Grand Theater</p>
<p>"We are all poor people far from home, why bother having met before?"</p>
<p>One is a veterinarian on the run after escaping from prison, and the other is a lonely and helpless stable boy. By chance, they join hands intimately and swear to the heavens, recognizing each other as father and son. But the father is eventually captured and returned to prison by the detectives, separating the ties of flesh and blood. This is a story that resembles "Deep Love of Calf." We, sitting under the screen, are deeply moved by this tragic story, and the acting skills of Wallace Beery and Mickey Rooney add infinite grief and indignation.</p>
<p>Such a simple story, almost eighty percent of the play is supported by Wallace Beery and Mickey Rooney; and they perform so deeply and movingly in a simple stable, such a thankless play, the acting skills of these two actors are worthy of praise.</p>
<p>Wallace Beery's straightforward and rough style is similar to that of Charles Laughton, that is, they both use exquisite movements to outline the personality of this type of character. However, this is not an accumulation of movements, but a result of painstakingly studying and experiencing. Such as "Viva Villa!" and "Deep Love of Calf," he can create such a character, and it is very real. Moreover, he not only created the appearance of such a character, but also matched it with rich emotions, such as in "Stablemates," after he gets drunk, he tells Mickey that he used to cure a horse, but suddenly he denies it. Mickey pleads with him, so he is finally moved by the child's tears and tells him to go to town to buy anesthetic. In this scene, Wallace Beery really acted touchingly, his pronunciation and movements all reveal strong emotions. Is this kind of success accidental? Finally, he mingles in the racetrack, watching Mickey's horse race. He is cheering and shouting, and even when he meets the detectives who are arresting him, he still calls out impulsively. But when he separates from Mickey, how can that kind of paternal love not move people to tears?</p>
<p>Mickey Rooney is now Hollywood's most popular child star. His "Boys Town" was selected as one of the top ten great films. To have him and Wallace Beery co-star as father and son in such a story is really an excellent arrangement.</p>
<p>However, we cannot ignore the director's contribution. In a play that is almost entirely supported by two people, his grasp of the emotional atmosphere is very strong. For example, treating horses in the stable; Mickey knowing Dreer's past and fearing that his father will be arrested during the race, resulting in conflict with Dreer; the father and son parting, etc., are all good examples. Moreover, the director has also handled many scenes very lively and humorous, so that the play does not become dull due to being just two people, such as Dreer telling the story of curing a horse in the past; the father and son on the beach; Dreer being entangled by the widow, etc.</p>
<p>In short, "Stablemates" is a good play.</p>
<p>The whole film is dyed light brown, and it seems brighter than color films.</p>
<p>Also worth mentioning is the "Visual Poem" Optical Poem before the feature film, which aroused our great interest. It uses the jumping of various patterns, matching the rhythm of the music, and then dyeing it with various colors. This should be one of the most moving programs among various short films.</p>

<p>Chapter 20: Crimson Powder Eliminates Enemies, Difficult to Dissipate Karma. Recording Window Talks of Love, Re-Tying a Good Marriage</p>
<p>In fact, Yuan Shuwen was also with them before, and knew that the love between Zhao Letian and Pan Peiying had reached maturity. These two must be the so-called lovers who have become a family. Later, she heard that Zhao Letian had become a student soldier, fighting guerrilla warfare, and was injured and entered the hospital, and his leg was amputated. She knew more clearly than Pan Peiying. Because Yuan Shuwen's current husband is a military doctor. She heard them mention Zhao Letian, and she said that he was our classmate, and a female classmate named Pan married him. She wholeheartedly thought that Pan Peiying had already married him. Not only did she not know that Pan Peiying had been forced by her father to reject Zhao Letian's letter, she also did not know that Pan Peiying's father was the one who held a position in the puppet government. Yuan Shuwen is a bit scatterbrained, so today when she met Pan Peiying, she asked about Zhao Letian. Pan Peiying is very careful. After thinking carefully, she knew that she had misunderstood, and said: "Sister Shuwen, I haven't seen the Mr. Zhao Letian you mentioned for a long time." Yuan Shuwen was also stunned when she heard this, and said: "Huh! You two are not married and living together? Then when he was injured and entered the hospital, and later came out of the hospital recovered, where were you at that time?" Pan Peiying could not tell her that the communication line between her and Zhao Letian had been cut off at that time. And at this time, she was distraught after hearing Yuan Shuwen's words. Is Zhao Letian dead or not? So she told her directly: "Sister Shuwen! You have misunderstood. I have never married Zhao Letian. So when you just said you wanted to visit us two, I felt that these words were a bit abrupt." Yuan Shuwen said: "Oh dear! Is that true? Then please forgive my presumption. I wholeheartedly thought that you two would definitely achieve a good marriage, and there was nothing more to say. It is knowable that there are unexpected things in the world. Then you...you..." Yuan Shuwen meant to ask: If you didn't marry Zhao Letian, who did you marry? At this time, Pan Peiying was full of doubts, because she thought: Listening to her tone, Zhao Letian is simply not dead. Is this reliable? So she asked: "There was a time when it was rumored that Zhao Letian had already died for the country, saying that he was killed in action during a certain night raid." Yuan Shuwen said: "Yes! At that time, all the newspapers published his death notice. In fact, he was only injured. Later, one leg was amputated, and he gradually recovered. Because my husband is a doctor, although he was not the one who examined him, he knew everything. He told me when he came back, and I said that Zhao Letian was our classmate, so he often came to tell me about his recuperation process, until he recovered and left the hospital." (139)</p>

<h3 id="e73">Shirley Temple Visits Paris <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Little star Shirley Temple is already ten years old this year. She's grown very quickly, standing at about four feet, five and three-eighths inches tall, and looks completely like a young lady. After Fox Company recently finished filming "The Little Princess" and other films, they decided to give her a long summer vacation, allowing her to travel abroad. The destination is France, accompanied by her parents and servants. They recently took the Messanie ship and went straight to Paris. Shirley has been learning French for three years, and she will definitely be able to say a few words to her Parisian fans. Don't underestimate little Shirley, her footsteps have already traversed many places. Last year, she traveled all over the United States, visiting the President at the White House and seeing Elephant King at Quito Mountain. She was extremely well-liked, but unfortunately, she overexerted herself and became seriously ill in Boston, causing the whole world to worry about her. Therefore, she decided to take it easy, but fans still pestered her endlessly. When she went to France via San Francisco to visit the Exposition, it caused a great sensation. Passing through Honolulu, she was seized by the crowd and hailed as the "Sweetheart of Hawaii," staying for over a month before being released. Her magic is truly remarkable.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Charlie McCarthy <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Jue</p>
<p>On the silver screen, we often see a middle-aged man and a strangely shaped dwarf appear, always inseparable. The dwarf has a wide mouth and a pair of round eyes; he likes to talk, and his words are so witty that they often cause laughter throughout the theater. His fluent and playful wit loves to expose the false faces of gentlemen, causing those gentlemen in the dark to blush with shame, but strangely enough, they not only do not hate him, but actually warmly welcome him. Isn't this intriguing? It also shows his greatness. So who exactly is he?</p>
<p>The larger of the two was created eighteen years ago when a piece of ordinary Michigan white pine, under the artistic hands of Chicago sculptor Siwert Tobmaak, gained the appearance of a naughty child! He is called Charlie McCarthy, who is the dwarf mentioned above. Today, he has become the most valuable piece of wood in the world, insured for $5,000, but its true value is much greater.</p>
<p>Charlie's first appearance in front of an audience was in collaboration with Edgar Bergen. They did some small satirical performances in a theater outside Chicago and received audience approval. On the way home that night, they decided to cooperate permanently (Bergen is the middle-aged man, so he and Charlie are always inseparable). This performance only earned $5 in remuneration, which cannot really be called a success. After a long struggle, true success finally came to them in the summer of 1936, and since then, they have become world-renowned. Last year's "Varsity Show" and "Letter of Introduction" were both successful works, and indeed many viewers went for Charlie!</p>
<p>His latest work, "You Can't Cheat an Honest Man," is now showing in this city. The female lead, Baba, a princess from Sarawah, India, had a very appropriate criticism of Charlie. She said, "What moves me most about Charlie is his great personality, which no one can match. Secondly, he has remarkable eloquence. No matter what you talk to him about, he can always give you a clever and ingenious answer. He dresses very nicely, showing his attention to decoration, and his 'romantic' art is also extremely profound. However, there is one thing I find quite annoying: why is Edgar Bergen always stuck by his side?" (Donation for Charity)</p>

<p>— (Qin Tian)</p>
<p>Laurel and Hardy have been satisfied with each other since they accidentally got together in 1927, so they have been working together ever since. At that time, Laurel asked MGM to allow them to cooperate forever, and the company agreed, so they produced many excellent slapstick films, such as "The Battle of the Century," "A Chump at Oxford," "Way Out West," and "Block-Heads," all of which are rare treasures, and at the same time, they produced many short and concise funny films.</p>
<p>However, most of these jokes and scripts were written by Stan Laurel, so he was very arrogant, especially towards the company. He felt that his position was extremely important, often expressed dissatisfaction, and often threatened to split up with Hardy, and also threatened MGM. Now that they have finally parted ways, we cannot help but express our regret.</p>
<p>After they split up, Stan Laurel, in his capacity as a producer, will form his own film company, while Oliver Hardy will collaborate with a man named Harry Langdon. This Mr. Langdon's build is, of course, only half the size of Hardy's. Langdon and Hardy's first film is "Zenobia's Infidelity," which tells the story of a doctor who loses his business because he treats an elephant burned in a circus fire, causing his patrons to clamor. It is said that Langdon and Hardy will only shoot feature films, not short films, and their films will also change the usual Laurel and Hardy style of slapstick and change to proper comedy.</p>

<p>Ren Guang and An E, the authors of film songs such as "Fisherman's Song" and "Fight the Wolves," were originally a passionate couple who lived together for a long time, but never held a formal wedding ceremony.</p>
<p>Ren Guang went to Paris to study music before the August 13th Incident. Now he has returned to China and transferred to Chongqing, where he teaches at the Art Academy founded by Tao Xingzhi. At the same time, he also leads Chongqing's famous singing group. It is said that he is also preparing to go to Singapore soon!</p>
<p>An E is not only active in Chongqing's music groups, but she has also joined the New Life Women's Work Corps under the leadership of Madame Chiang. In addition, whenever she has free time, she works hard to write patriotic lyrics to meet the needs of various philharmonic and singing groups.</p>
<p>This famous pair of Chinese film song writers, this pair of lovers who have gone through hardships, are now meeting in Chongqing, and it is inevitable that their old love will rekindle. However, according to friends close to them, they value national affairs even more than their personal feelings, which is worthy of being an example for those who only talk about "saving the country through love."</p>
<p>The two little girls, Chen Juanjuan and Hua Lingxian, have been performing with the Meihua Song and Dance Troupe in various parts of Southeast Asia for years. Their singing and dancing skills are both excellent, and they have won high praise from the overseas Chinese. They have now arrived in Hong Kong and will soon return to Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e79">After Watching "Cloud Fairy" <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>"Cloud Fairy" is a film completely different from "Mulan Joins the Army," but its moving story and excellent performance are as wonderful as "Mulan Joins the Army." We believe that this film will definitely be warmly loved by the audience.</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang's acting skills are indeed surprisingly successful. She has completely shed the shackles of ancient costumes in "Mulan Joins the Army" and seems to have completed a new soul. The sweetness in her singing is really enviable. Chen Yunshang is the smartest and most beautiful female star in Chinese cinema. Audiences who have seen this film should all feel the same way.</p>
<p>Yue Feng's directing skills are also extremely superb, with many clever touches, which shows that he put a lot of effort into the production. Among the other actors, Wang Yin's Jia Hu, Lu Luming's Huiying, Sun Min's Huang Jiaqing, Xu Xinyuan's Lin Shaomei, and Bai Hong's Bili all have excellent achievements. Another noteworthy point is the performance of the female students of the Xinhua Song and Dance Troupe in the song and dance scenes, which is also very beautiful. Of course, the director's credit cannot be denied.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Yao Qing and Li Qing's later years are far inferior to Feng Qing's</p>
<p>In terms of his age, he is about the same as Hui Bao and Xiao Pei, but his health is really much worse than theirs. For example, in Beijing, just as September begins, he hangs warm curtains in his house, and the doors and windows are all sealed very tightly, not allowing even a bit of wind to enter. Sometimes, when the weather is sunny and sunlight shines into the room, and there is no wind outside, he dares to roll up a five-inch square piece of window paper to let in some fresh air, but at most, he has to hurry up and put it down after a dozen minutes, still letting the thick clouds and mist in the room surround them, a pair of golden boys and jade girls. Some people say that if a person with a very heavy smoking habit moves to a place with a non-smoking tenant, even the mice under the floor and in the wall holes will probably die of addiction. I think the mice in Feng Er's house feel the same way. Once the weather enters October, Feng Qing simply doesn't dare to go out. If there is a show at a restaurant, he has to have the rickshaw pulled to the door, wait for him to put on his fur robe and coat, and wrap a very long and thick scarf around his head and face. Only revealing his eyes, he dives into the rickshaw and puts down the cotton cloth door curtain (Beijing rickshaws all have cotton cloth awnings), and then he dares to go out with peace of mind. The three brothers originally lived in the ancestral house in the Damashen Temple outside Qianmen. Yao Qing and Li Qing lived in the front courtyard, and Feng Qing lived alone in the back courtyard. Although the brothers were in the same house, they didn't see each other or talk to each other for the entire year. The first and second mistresses didn't exchange a word either. If friends and relatives come to visit, it is best to go to the front yard or go to the back yard another day. If you sit in the first mistress's room for a while and then go to the second mistress's room for a chat, if Feng Er and his wife find out, they simply won't want to talk to you. In other words, if you walk from the back yard into the front yard, Madame Wang will say, "Are you coming from the rich man's house? Don't come to our place to get infected with poverty!" She can make you not know whether to laugh or be angry. In summary, why did their feelings fall to this point? —(40)—</p>

<p>Edges (continued)</p>
<p>When turning outward, the whole body should lean outward, and the center of gravity of the body must be outside the foot. The force of the foot is used on the outer edge of the shoe, and the waist should not be bent, because bending the waist will instead cause the center of gravity to move inward.</p>
<p>When the body leans, be bold. Not only will you not fall, but you will also be able to move forward in a circle.</p>
<p>This picture shows the accurate method of leaning the body, where the center of gravity is outside the foot, but there is no danger of falling.</p>
<p>This picture shows that the leaning method is incorrect, resulting in a curved body and bent waist, which is quite unsightly.</p>
<p>Practice method (1) Circling is the easiest method. When moving, use the left and right feet alternately. For example, when the right foot uses the outer edge of the shoe to move forward, move the left foot in front of the right foot, cross it to the right of the right foot, and when landing, make it fall on the inner edge of the left shoe. This will enable the whole body to lean to the right. When the left foot leaves the ground, gradually make it last longer. Practice until you can make the left foot not cross, and still be able to push the left foot behind the right foot.</p>

<p>Screen Horse vs. Central Cannon</p>
<p>Movements following the previous game</p>
<p>Cannon 8 Advances 5 Cannon 5 Retreats 1 Rook 1 Advances 1 Explanation</p>
<p>Cannon 2 Moves to the Center Square to allow Pawn 5 to advance across the river, all based on changes from the first two game move, the main method is to send a central pawn to recapture the opponents center pawn, the prior game used a sunken cannon, the game before that used a rook trap, this game uses the cannon 8 advances 2 along the river in order to take it.</p>
<p>The method for exchanging the cannon and converting it to seize the initiative to crack the linked cannon formation with Cannon 8 advancing 5 has been mentioned previously. Cannon 5 retreating 1 indicates an unwillingness to exchange cannons. To the central area’s momentum, Rook 1 advancing 1 acknowledges the other side's strong central line and is eager to initiate the rook, although not the correct movement, it also offers a way to seize the initiative. At this time, if the cannon player moved the Pawn 7 advances 1, Rook 1 moving across to square 4 would immediately regain the initiative.</p>

<p>The overseas Chinese laborers in Cuba, a Spanish colony, are quite harshly treated by the locals. When their initial contracts expire, they are forced to renew them, and are not allowed to return to their home country. The imperial court, hearing of such evil practices, discussed the matter with the Spanish envoy, and no longer allowed Chinese people to work there. The envoy insisted that there were no such abuses, and earnestly requested that an envoy be sent to Cuba to personally investigate. The imperial court has already decided to send an envoy to the country to investigate and report back, and has also appointed the customs commissioners of Hankou and Tianjin to accompany him as counselors.</p>

<p>The other day, Governor-General Zhang Gong visited the arsenal, dismissing his attendants and guards, and entered the gate with his retinue. The officials who were waiting to greet him did not have time to line up and wait respectfully. After Governor-General Zhang entered the bureau, he met with Feng Guan, the director of the gun bureau, and inquired in detail about the manufacture of ships and machinery. He also summoned Yao Jun, the translator of Western texts, and others in order, and reviewed the new translations. The Governor-General greatly praised them and ordered them to translate other books. After the meeting, he toured the steam hammer factory and machine room, examined the machinery, and inquired about the methods in detail. It is said that the official business has been completed, and the ship left Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Suicide in the Examination Hall <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>It is rumored that there are vengeful ghosts in the rural examination halls who can enter to report their grievances. Therefore, whenever there is an examination, there are often cases of suicide by cutting the throat or hanging oneself, as well as sudden deaths due to illness. This year's Zhejiang examination hall was quite peaceful. However, it was heard that Zhang, a scholar from Ningbo, stabbed himself in the throat with a small paper-cutting knife in the re-examination hall, and bled all over his body, resulting in his death. Alas, how strange! In the re-examination hall, he did not even know whether he would enter the thorny gate, and he acted so hastily. Could it be that he met an impatient ghost? It is heard that Zhang's body was placed outside the examination hall, and his coffin will be returned to Ningbo immediately.</p>
