<p>社評</p>
<h3>希特勒對羅斯福的答覆</h3>
<p>兩星期前，美國大總統羅斯福致電德義兩國，提出幾項極具體的建議，要求置答；希特勒居然鄭重其事地預定於四月二十八日答覆。屆期希特勒果然播音答覆了，然而羅斯福總統却就在他演說的時候，一夢黃粱，表示不願聽聞，這眞是一件多麼幽默的事！原來希特勒這回答覆的措辭，早在世人預料之中；即使他在覆文中提供了什麼諾言，但他的諾言向來不値一文錢，不足以聳人聽聞；再則，羅斯福總統的通電，與其說是詢問，無寗算是宣言或警告，對方的答覆與否，根本也不關緊要，所以儘管希特勒賣力唱戲，那點戲的人却反而不加一睬。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統謂最近歐洲的兩國和菲洲的一國喪失了獨立·遠束的一獨立國正受着鐵蹄的蹂躪，此種局勢如果不設法阻止其發展，那未世界大禍即迫在眉睫，因此必須要求侵略國停止此種侵略的行爲，保持世界的安寗。希特勒的答覆，却說那三獨立國的喪失獨立，責任完全在一九一九年的巴黎和會，和凡爾塞條的，而不在目前操刀宰割者身上。這種話原是侵略者侵略哲學的基礎理論，希特勒這樣地說，一方面表示他對羅斯福總統的詭辯遁詞；另一方面却不啻聲明他要繼續應用這種侵略理論，繼續施行侵略的瘋狂行爲，這可說是希特勒演詞中最重要的一點。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統具體列舉大小國家三十國，要求侵略者提供保證在十年至二十五年裘對這些國家不行使武力的攻擊；並且說如果侵略者肯這樣，羅總統將通知對象各國，請他們作同樣的保證，然後再召開國際會議，建立永久的世界和平。希特勒對於這一點，却先用了一種手段，誘騙各小國招供未受德國的威脅，然後就把這種威逼的供詞，用作論據，對羅總統作空洞的答覆；並附帶聲明如果召開國際會議，不足以解決難題，而且德國也根本不願意加入所謂裁判式的會議。殊不知羅總統所提問題的焦點純在侵略國是吾願意放棄侵略政策，只要侵略國肯轉變態度，其餘民治國家的誠意合作都不成問題的。希特勒斷非笨伯，難道不懂得解鈴繫鈴全在侵略者的自己身上？然而他却故意作這樣變更論點的遁詞，那也無非表示他侵略的慾望永不滿足，目前決不肯改變態度罷了。</p>
<p>認識了希特勒演詞的中心思想在不變侵略態度，那末他的同時宣佈廢止一九三五年英德海軍協定和一九三四年德波協定，原也是必然的行動，無足驚奇；而且希特勒和其同道們，今後必然仍舊行使侵略手段，向世界上任何弱點進攻。</p>
<p>然而，我們如果認爲希特勒的演詞已經宣佈了世界公理的毀滅，和平的絕望，那也未必盡然。我們從希特勒的演詞中也充分地看出了一種色厲內荏的態度。他一方面大言炎炎，發揮侵略哲學；一方面却又滿口和平，侈談誠意。雖然他的諾言向不兌現，可是至少表示他目前還不敢公然挑戰，或者說還不至於在今日甘爲戎首。因爲從主觀上看，德國的本身力量，還沒有資格作二次世界大戰的戎首，同時德義日的三角同盟，最近又因日本態度的猶豫而有分裂的可能；從客觀上說，民治陣綫的力量却已因英國的實行徵兵制，英蘇談話的將近完成，以及美國反侵略熊度的日益具體化等等而加强起來，如果德國此時鹵莽挑釁，結果必然會自陷泥淖。以希特勒的精警，難道見不及此？所以英德海軍協定和德波協定的廢止，與其說是德國的强硬表示，無寗說是希特勒感於環境的威脅，故意裝腔作勢，掩蔽其內心的恐慌。因爲那些協定早已被侵略者視同廢紙，形式上的廢止實在不成什麼問題的。</p>
<p>希特勒以後行動的方向，或許要壓迫波蘭解決但澤市和走廊問題，同時要向英國提出所謂索還殖民地的耍求。然而他是吾會發動這些新攻勢，以及是吾會堅持他的侵略態度，還須看民治陣綫各國是吾能夠迅速地完成集體安全組織，發揮一種聯合的力量，來撲滅這種侵略的狂燄。希特勒們在發動新攻勢之前，或許還要施用慣技，用縱橫椑闔的手段，分化民治陣綫，實行各個擊破的方策。這一點確實較他的演說詞更値得重視，要請愛好和平各國注意！</p>

<p>紀律與精神</p>
<p>（丑）戰地宣傳人員之紀律與精。</p>
<p>神宣傳工作人員、處於更艱苦　環境、負有更重大的使命、故須有艱苦卓絕的精神、二期抗戰開始後、最高領袖及部長、歷次對政工人員的訓話、關於政工人員所應守的紀律與應具的精神、都有懇切的訓示、（一）關於紀律方面、最高領袖對政工會議訓詞說、「政工人員、必須在生活上、行動上、表現正確感化官兵、不但使其、不疑而且使之信仰、則一切工作實施、未有辦不通者」、部長也有具體的指示「政工紀律、除原有規定者外茲訂以下原則」、「以民衆之勞作、定部隊之紀律」、「以部隊之紀律，定政工之成績」、戰地宜傳工作人員、必須嚴格遵守身體力行、藉以改正人們荒謬宣傳工作的觀念、（二）宣傳工作進展與吾、繫於工作人員之修養者甚大、故宜傳工作人員、必須努力自修、以取得被宣傳者的信仰、第一必須以身作則、最高領袖調示我們、「政工人員之態度行動、必須公正、生活必須節儉、所謂「以言敎」不如「以身敎一、「感化之速且大也」、部長訓詞、「我們各政工人員、並須作生活之宣傳、以前錢生活等於士兵之生活、後方生活等於民衆之生活爲標準、再宜傳以身體力行爲主、不尙空談、第二應具通訊兵炊事兵之服務精神、部長訓詞、「我們政工人員、應具通訊兵之精神一、「早起遲睡、」這都是很要緊的工作信條、能够做倒這兩點、才能受人尊敬、爲人表率、在戰地做宣傳工作、允共是對敵宣傳工作、應有炊事兵之精神、一先部隊而作、後部隊而息」、第三須隨時研究隨時學習、隨時反省、我們應隨時隨地、因人因事、悉心硏究、細心學習、虛心反省、接受血的寶貴經騐、創造出我們新的勝利的工作方式來、（附註）關於「第二期抗戰開始後的目前局勢、」已見本部前頒的第二期抗戰宣傳綱要、故不再錄、（完）（二十六日電）</p>

<p>希氏致詞　有如演劇</p>
<p>（柏林）希特勒之演說、歷時兩小時半之久、吐詞之徐、與夫狀若演劇、殊異常狀、聆者即知其扼要點、顯在抨擊英國與波蘭之條的、希氏讀及羅斯福總統呼籲和小電文中所舉之國名時、笑聲震屋、當其云及里志丹斯坦時亦引起大噱、云及巴力斯坦時、衆爲哄堂半分鐘之久、聽者除議員八百八十八人外、且有數千萬人民、蓋其演詞曾由無綫電傳至地球各隅也、希氏抨擊羅總統之言、幾全如報紙之預料、故此段演詞不足令人驚訝、人人皆知希氏將拒絕羅總統之建議、今不過欲聞希氏詳述拒絕之理由、衆意希氏之演詞或將爲德報强化抨擊波蘭之先聲、已往數日中德報復紛紛登載波蘭虐待德僑之情形、政界咸謂希氏允於各國申請保證時願予以保證一節、絕非接受羅總統之呼籲、此種保證大的將爲純粹德國與有關係國間之事、故任何侵犯實與第三國無關、（二十八日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）據路透社海軍訪員聲稱、此間人士對於希特勒之決定廢棄英德海軍條的、並不引爲十分驚異、因此事固在意中也、目下官方雖尙未發表批評、惟一般研究海軍事務者、咸信此項條的之廢棄、實際上並無多大出入、蓋英國海軍一且奮發、德海軍事實上將無追及之可能、德國之龐大造艦程序、將成爲一種嚴厲加重之經濟負担、况各種軍艦允其爲大型者、決不能旦夕造成、故以爲德國之海軍建造、似將一部分集中於潛艇云、（二十八日路透電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）德元首希特勒咋日所發表之演說、此間各報均以懷疑態度處之、咸謂語氣雖已較爲溫和、但一九三四年之德波兩國互不侵犯協定、一九三五年之英德兩國海軍協定、却已宣吿廢止、希特勒對於法國獨加靑睞、其意顯欲離間各民治國陣綫、但此種策略、殊鮮成功希望、此外、希特勒此决演詞對於緩和國際時局一事、未見有何裨補、時局前途仍屬不安定、右派斐伽羅報載稱、一希特勒演詞主要命意、乃在安定德國與論美國總統羅斯福所發出之删電、業在德國境內引起重大反應、可於此項演詞獲一明證、」小巴黎人報載稱、「國際時局絕不因此項演詞而有所變更、希特勒敵對之意、正集中於英國波蘭、對於法國獨以比較寬大的態度處之、實則英法波三國對於當前之共同危機、業已決定團結一致加以反抗、各該國已無一人能爲此項策略所動、」巴黎迥聲報載稱、「今有」國焉、其所發出之表示、不論如何動聽、終不能成爲一和平國家、吾人對於該國仍當妥爲防範、以免貽誤於他日、」秩序報載稱、「希特勒演詞不無爲難與遲疑之處、實已昭然若揭、希氏顯有徬徨歧途之感、今後究常公開從事戰爭、抑或賡續使用恐怖恫嚇手段、同時並昌言和平、似尙未有所決定、」</p>
<p>社會黨黨魁勃魯姆、則在該黨機關報「人民報」發表一文、略謂、「和戰問題、當決之於行動、不能決之於言論、希特勒果將出以行動乎、目下尙無何項端倪可言、美國之干涉、英法兩國態度之堅決、各民治國聯合陣錢之組成、凡此或可促使希特勒懸崖勒馬、亦未可必」云、（廿九日合瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>和平建議被拒　美國大感失望</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）政府方面昨夜相信、德元首希特勒昨在衆議院所發表之演說、對於以和平談判解決歐洲糾紛之望、極其微弱、美國會方面且信此一演說、爲早日發生戰事危機之先兆、白宮及國務院方面對於希特勒演說、並無正式批評、然私人評議、均認德兀首之演說、並無足以减低戰事可能之傾向、據接近白宮者言、官方對於希特勒氏以此種方式答覆美總統最近之和平呼籲、極爲憤慨、認德國此舉、在外交上殊爲失禮、而政府方面亦稱、此間不能認希氏演說、爲對美方書面建議之正式答覆、一般觀察者認羅斯福總統致希特勒電文之中心問題、厥爲德國是吾採取武力政策、或願以和平談判而解決一切、乃希特勒對國際會議及美方提議均表反對、外界對希特勒之非難英德海軍協定、亦頗注意、因預料該一協定、足以强硬美國海軍建造計劃、亦正如對英國所發生之效力然、蓋以日本巳附着於羅馬柏林軸心、故德國海軍力量之增加、或即將爲全世界海軍力量聯絡一氣之主因、從白宮方面唯一的官方批評、即總統秘書愛勒所發之聲明、愛氏對於希特勒所稱、總統於未將其和平建議致送德國之前、已向世界透露此一消息予以駁斥、愛勒稱、此一和平呼籲、於四月十四日下午九時（東方標準時間）電達柏林、於四月十五日上午十時三十分始向報界宜佈云云、（廿九日美聯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）關於德國元首希特勒演詞內容、除共產黨某某人士認爲尙未杜塞談判門戶而外、國會方面、咸皆感有惡劣印象、並謂修正現行中立法、以便利歐洲各民治國一項運動、茲巳獲有鼓勵、特參院外委會主席畢德曼、即主張便利各民治國最力之人、尙未表示意見、茲將各議員見解彙誌如次、</p>

<p>（三）衆院外委會代理主席白魯姆宣稱「歷史上譏刺、與顚倒是非之詞、當以此項演詞爲首屈一指、德國民衆如何爲希特勒元首所麻痺、而信從其見解亦可於此見之、要之、希持勒雖力言願與各國和平相處、轉瞬之間、即向波蘭提出一種哀的美敦書、此乃渠之慣技、世人當巳瞭若指掌矣、」</p>
<p>（四）華盛頓洲民主黨參議院波恩（孤立主義派）則謂、「希特勒演詞雖足令人驚訝、但無新頴之點、歐洲各國自相紛爭、巳千餘年之久、他日戰事爆發、美國務未可捲入漩渦」云、（卄八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>蘇聯評論　條約不受尊重　德無信義可言</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）此間一般人士聲稱、希特勒演說之主耍方針、上週間蘇聯各報已料及之、故未起驚訝、宣布廢棄英德海軍協定與德波協定、巳證明與德國訂的之毫無價値、與愛好和平國家維持密切合作之必要、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）德元首希特勒昨日發表演說時、曾同時廣播至國外、但莫斯科方面因蘇聯無綫電臺在同時間內亦廣播節目、致音波相混、故未能聆聽全文、昨晚此　各報所以亦無隻字道及、（二十八日海通電）</p>
<h3>侵略國家　沆瀣一氣　義日報紙論調　同情德國政策</h3>
<p>（羅馬）德元首希特勒本日所發表之演說、此間法西斯黨人士咸皆無保留加以歡迎、其對於元首重申德義兩國聯帶關係、贊許義國進兵阿爾巴尼亞兩層、允加以稱道、咸謂觀於德國廢止一九三四年德波互不侵犯協定暨一九三五年英德海軍協定、即知該國業已決定抵抗英國之「包圍政策」、墨索里尼首相代言人蓋達、並在義大利日報發表一文、略謂、「此項演詞足以表明德國强大有力、該國力量如何、旣極有把握、即各友邦亦復緩急可恃、希特勒兀首且已重申軸心各國所採之歷史的立塲、並向各國政府之以攻勢企圖維護帝國主義利益者、發出警吿矣」云、（廿八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（東京）東京各報均以驚駭之態度、在前頁刋載希特勒之演說、「朝日新聞」社評載稱、英美法曾暗示如果戰事爆發、德義應負其責、希特勒之演說今已完全證明其暗示之不確、彼等試圖不訴諸此種可怖手段而獲得其相信乃應得者、而事實適與相反、英法雖亟欲維持現狀、但終必易導各國入於戰爭、波蘭對德國之倨傲態度、與去年九月間捷克驕傲相類、英波乃因以成立協定、該協定對和平解決德波爭案並無供獻、希特勒今旣明言渠願以不侵略保證給予各國、則英法應嚴重的再度硏究其政策云、「讀賣新聞」則稱、英國對德運用恫嚇與妥協之雙管政策、但希特勒昨日已宣布不變德國對外政策之堅定決心、英國長此不改其挑　態度、則英德關係不能復入正軌、拯救世界免遭浩刦之唯一方法、厥在尊重公道愛好和平的軸心帝國之團結一致云、（廿）八日路透電）</p>

<h3>波蘭處境苦悶　羅國寄以同情</h3>
<p>羅京　德國元首希特勒之演說、頃由此間半官界人士加以評論云、各國之受有威脅者、當以羅馬尼亞之同盟國即波蘭國爲最甚、希特勒元首茲又使用一貫手段、竭力安慰其他各國、以陷波蘭於孤立、此與前此努力安慰他國以陷捷克於孤立、前後如出一轍、雖然、羅馬尼亞亦在數星期之前受有威脅、（指德國向該國提出各項經濟耍求而言）共對於波蘭國處境、完全寄以同　、但情勢如此、羅國必須與各關係國加速進行談判、以期保障安全、所望德國對於波蘭僅以　止互不侵犯協定爲事、不致立即有所舉動云、（廿八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅京　據此間宣稱、廢止德波協定之可能的影響、將促進波蘭與羅馬尼亞合作之發展、據聞羅外相加芬科由倫敦歸來後、巴爾幹協的各國不久即將在羅京再度召集會議、屆時對於保加利亞所提出之領土要求、將加以討論、衆料巴爾幹協的各國對於領土之改變、仍將如前之堅決反對、惟或願對於經濟合作之種種計劃、對保加利亞表示同意、（廿八日路透電）</p>
<p>羅方否認對德　曾提接壞要求</p>

<p>現代社云、昨向寗波旅滬同鄕會悉、該會於咋日下午、接到寗波商會主席周大烈氏電告、除報吿日機轟炸被災情形外、並稱靈橋被毀、但昨晚報載靈橋仍完整如常、未被波及、經多方探詢結果、始悉靈橋確於日機投彈時中彈一枚、但因炸力不大、且該橋建築鞏固、故路面略受損毀、現時當局對被災各戶、正竭力撫慰振救、並竭力安定人心、故秩序業已恢復、</p>

<h3>滬市金融穩定　各業安渡四底</h3>
<p>錢業公會通告內盤利率</p>
<p>各荘對到期之款允通融</p>
<p>今日為滬巿工商業之四底比期、錢業通告內盤利率、各莊對於到期之信用長期款、均允通融展期至十底、並貸放國貨事業工廠商號新放款、金融市塲、依然安定、各業穩定無虞、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>集議內盤</p>
<p>錢業同業公會於本月二十五日下午二時、召集四底內盤會議、到福源·順康·實豐·五豐·同潤·鴻勝·惠豐·存德等莊、經理席季明·張夢周·嚴大有·沈景樑·裴雲卿·徐文卿等、集議四底內盤行市議決為五元五角、茲錄其通吿如下、「逕啟者、本屆內盤利率、經本月二十五日召開內盤會議、經議決為五元五角、用特函達、即希查照為荷」</p>
<p>四底已屆</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向銀錢業探悉、上海市塲之定期信用放款、大都以六個月為限、名曰「六對」、即六個對月之意、例如於每年四底及十底、為開始及結束之期、或謂之「四十長期」、蓋長年商貨旺發之時、厥在四十兩月之後、苟於五六月間新貨登塲需款、例於四月底預為做進、十一月或年底欲辦隔年商貨需款、須於十月底預為做進、今年之四底巳屆、</p>
<p>國貨貸款</p>
<p>錢莊業已根據「內盤」利率、再行分別加價、視銀根而各莊自做、今年對於國貨事業之工廠行號、已允儘量放信用長期款、利率行市由各莊與各行號直接商定之、以資扶助國貨事業之發展、惟對於淪陷區域內之春繭·新茶·菜子·小麥·等、收買貸款、一律予以拒絕、其非淪陷區域內者、則仍予以酌量貸放、</p>
<p>到期各款</p>
<p>今年四底到期之信用放款、雖確數無法查明、但據估計、的有四五千萬元、錢莊的佔十之八九、銀行不過十之一二、因滙劃錢莊之業務、向以信用放款為主、今各承放錢莊對信用可靠之行號、均巳允通融展期至十月底、惟利息必須付淸、另訂新放款契的、上項展期手續、業由各莊與行號分別辦理、均於今日以前辦竣、</p>
<p>各業安渡</p>
<p>戰後各行莊依照部定金融辦法、實行緊縮、增厚準備、並得中中交農四行之調劑、以及滙劃票據制度之收效、所以上海之金融市塲、依然穩定如恒、各種利率、鮮有變動、銀行錢莊之倒閉、絕無發生、與過去往年之四底、實大不相同、銀根毫無緊張之現象、各業因戰後畸形發展、均能安渡此四底、反較戰前為安好、</p>

<h3>日商剝削內河航業　將舉行總罷運</h3>
<p>蘇浙各帮船戶已一致行動　駁船業不堪剝削加入抗爭</p>
<p>本埠北蘇州路四三四號日商上海內河輪船公司、自統制內河航運後、各路貨運、全被壟斷、致民船無法營業、生計困難、故各帮進行反對、並將聯合駁船戶舉行總罷運、以示對抗、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>內河運輸日偽壟斷</p>
<p>上海內河輪船公司、係屬日淸輪船公司操縱內河運輸之總機關、由鄭文光。李堃和·担任「經理」及「營業主任」、其開闢之航綫、計有北新涇·（包括虹橋）閔行·葉榭·滸浦·常熟·湖州·新五厙·西塘·楓涇·松江·無錫·（經過蘇州）等班、除搭客外、並裝運貨物所有日偽發給一採辦證」、概由該公司包辦、凡未經許可之民船、一律不准承接貨運、一面復任意抬高運費、向貨主勒索、極盡敲詐之能事、而所僱定之貨船酬勞、日偽人員轉輾剝削、所得甚微、甚至有時全數吞沒、一文無着、各船戶莫不呌苦連天、</p>
<p>各地民航生計困難</p>
<p>自內河運輸事務被日偽統制後、向恃代客裝運貨物、或小本販運之各地民船、受害匪淺、允以平日販運度活之米船·砂石船·柴船·菜船·糞船·油船·等、影響甚大、各船戶格於環境、雖向各該駐在之日偽「機關」領有「通行證」、但無「採辦證」、依然不能裝運、過去會有若干民船、因不明此中情形、承裝客貨、均被上海內河輪船公司查出後、報吿當地日軍、以致船戶不敢攬裝、貨主亦不敢託運、船戶生計、全吿斷絕、情形非常悲慘、</p>
<p>聯合駁船進行抗爭</p>
<p>各地民船、處此日偽淫威壓迫之下、無可申訴、為集中力量、表示堅決抗爭起見、現由無錫·常熟·松江·等各帮販運民船、首先組織聯合會、積極推動以來、浙屬如平湖·吳興·嘉善·張堰·楓涇·等處船戶、亦紛紛參加、同時被上海內河輪船公司僱用之沙駁船戶、亦深受日偽之剝削、已自感痛苦、故擬與各帮民船取一致行動、或將舉行總罷運、以示抗爭、</p>

<h3>日人籌備棉業取引所　意圖操縱紗價</h3>
<p>所址係金業交易所舊址</p>
<p>日方所發起之棉紗交易所、醞釀已久、但因一般經營紗布交易者、懼遭注意、致未實現、惟日方現仍積極籌備、並已覓定九江路四川路東花旗銀行隔壁金業交易所舊址為所址、規定經紀人身份保證金為三千元、交易以十包為單位、定五月一日開始、其標準牌號、內定為日華紗廠之藍緯牌及內外之水月牌兩種、意在壟斷市塲、操縱紗價、現金業交易所舊址門前懸有「株式會社上海棉業取引所創立事務所」字牌、屋內正在興工修建、</p>
<h3>京滬路日軍空虛　以橡皮人作兵</h3>
<p>裝置兵車往來梭巡</p>
<p>藉圖搖惑華軍視綫</p>
<p>邇日京滬滬杭兩路華方游擊隊活躍異常、而日軍則以前綫軍事緊張、紛紛抽調增援、致後防空虛、華軍即乘機襲擊、予以重創、昨據蘇州來客吿云、近日內地日軍、因兵員缺乏、無可徵調、但為虛張聲勢、威嚇華方起見、乃竟異想天開、置備橡皮人數百具、居然衣以黃色軍服、配以偽造槍械、其頭部亦能旋轉、遠望之幾與眞人無異、該項橡皮人均裝於軍用車上、由日軍四名押車、每乘傍晚之時、往來無錫·蘇州·等各站、大演其空城計之故技、表示日軍兵力充足、藉圖搖惑華軍視綫、初時華軍方面亦信以為眞、但現已揭穿、故發見橡皮人車時、輒施襲擊、日方心勞日拙、殊屬可笑、</p>
<h3>南通日軍　兩度慘敗</h3>
<p>援軍中發現女子　日兵補充成問題</p>
<p>昨得方自南通來之可靠消息稱、在本月十七日拂曉前、該處華軍游擊隊陳才福部、曾再度向日軍包圍進擊、當時駐在南通日軍人數雖多、但以猝不及防、故咸措手不及、倉皇應戰、死傷至重、即日軍官死亡、足達三十餘名、足徵此役中雙方激戰之烈、此外日軍輜重、亦損失奇重、終以後援斷絕、被陳部</p>
<p>擊出郊外日軍受此打擊後、認為奇辱、乃四出呼援、亟圖報復，終於二十日得到援軍二百各、乃於二十一日拂曉、連同先前殘部、分乘小汽艇七艘、向南通外圍江岸上陸作合圍式之反攻、但陳部早經得報、已事先安全退出、散佈四郊、故待日軍逐步進逼、陳部又早在日軍之後、作再度之包圍矣、比待日軍覺察、亟亟反顧、仍被</p>

<p>值得注意者、則此次日本援軍中竟發現女子、所有髮鬢、悉已剪去、服裝一如軍人、常時曾被陳部擊斃甚多、日軍不及移去、於是遂被發覺、因此足微日軍對於後援補充、巳成問題、而其國內亦確已無兵可調、鬧人口荒矣、</p>

<h3>五一勞動節的來歷</h3>
<p>— 逸明</p>
<p>小朋友們！明天是勞動節，這裏來介紹一些關於勞動節的史料和事實，目的是在使小朋友們對於這個勞動紀念有進一步的認識。</p>
<p>勞動節是先由美國起源的，以前美國的工人，正和其他各國的工人一樣，受盡了資本家的壓迫和欺凌。但美國的工人，終於覺醒了。一八八四年十月七日，美國和加拿大的勞工，首先在芝加哥開會，議決從一八八六年起，每一個五月一日，同盟罷工，反抗資本家的壓迫。那次提出的口號，便是「工作八小時，休息八小時，敎育八小時？」所謂「三八制度」，不達目的不止。兩年之後，到了五月一日那天，美國的工人列隊遊行，高呼口號，來了一次空前的示威。吾則美國的工人，每天工作在十小時以上，也很普遍。但經過那决的示威，隔得不久，美國的資本家，也就答應了工人的要求，實行工作八小時的工廠制度。美國的工人，得到此空前勝利之後，便定五月一日為美國的勞動節。</p>
<p>美國的工人，獲得勝利之後，結果就使歐洲的工人也覺醒起來，明白到所受的苦痛？於是也在五月一日，集會而遊行，向資本家示威，提出和美國工人同樣的口號，實行「三八制度」，改善勞工待遇，結果資本家也先後答應了工人的要求。到一八八九年國際社會黨在法京巴黎開會，便決定以五月一日為國際勞動紀念日。</p>
<p>這樣一來，勞動節日就很快的由英美兩國，介紹到全個世上面。而中國自民國初年，也就有這個勞動節，每年於五月一日，各工廠照例要放假一天。不過向來中國的工人，在資方壓迫之下，並不覺醒，除了「五一」休息一天外，不提出任何要求。直到北伐成功，全國統一而後，政府對勞工特別看重。一般的資本家，對工人的待遇，也改變以前的面目。各地工人，在工會領導之下，雖然有時會發生工潮，但始終是沒有越軌的行動。勞資雙方，大半能够合作，當然也用不到罷工和遊行示威了。總之近幾年來中國的工人地位，已提高不少，允共是戰事發生而後政府對工人是特別重視哩。這當然也是受了勞動節的影響</p>
<h3>一個牧童出身的天文學家</h3>
<p>— 經田</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們不要奇怪，怎樣一個牧童能夠做成一個天文學家呢？這便是古人說的：「有志者，事竟成，」祇要有堅定不移的目的，百折不回的精神，那末任何事情都能成功，你們不信，請讀後面的故事。</p>
<p>這牧童是一個蘇格蘭工人的小兒子，呌做詹姆士福格遜；他從小就很歡喜唸書，在他的哥哥們讀書的時候，他常常在旁邊很仔細的聽着，並且他又很喜歡發問，所以他很小就認識了許多字；他的父親知道他是一個可造之材，也未嘗不想送他上學，但是因為經濟的壓迫，終於打消這個計劃，於是不幸的福格遜只好去做一個牧羊童子了，這個職務輕鬆得很，他有好多的空閑，在這時問裏他常常做各種模型，像紡車哩，風車哩，但是他最愛好的不是這些柬西，而是天空中閃爍的星球。</p>
<p>夜來了，火紅的太陽隱藏在地平綫下，高高低低的山峯上，排列着許多燦爛的星球；福格遜取了一張毛毯，像鬼怪一般的坐在黑暗的大草原上，他手裏拿着一張弓，在拉得很緊的弦綫上，有九粒能活動的珠子，他舉起這張弓，對着天空中的一羣星球，同時把珠子左右移動，使它把一顆星遮沒，他再移動別一個珠子，使它遮沒乃　一　星。於是他便自言自語道：「這是兩顆星的距離，在弦上量出是一英寸牛。」接着他便在紙上畫兩點，代表這兩顆星的距離與位置；他繼續的一次一次在他的弓弦和珠子上觀察出共他的星的距離與位置，於是福格遜便製成了一張星球圖。</p>
<p>一天福格遜的星球圖，給他的主人－一個農夫—看見了，起初這農夫很覺滑稽，但是他的險色立即變成莊重，因為他巳知道這幅圖的意思了；當他聽完了這牧羊童子－詹姆士福格遜－所訴說的志願後，他便鼓勵福格遜把這幅圖謄淸，放大一下，再把它公布出去，不多幾年福格遜便做成了一有名的精巧的天文學家，同時他又被選為英國皇家學會的會員</p>
<p>福格遜在這惡劣的環境裏，憑着自己的努力，終於完成了自己的志願，何况你們有良好的環境，只要你們自己努力，那末你們的志願，沒有不能實現的，小朋友們，快快努力吧！</p>
<h3>回鄕樂</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>－　兒避難記之十九－</p>
<p>江山船駛行了的第五日，明兒在船頭上閒望着，那時他吃過了午飯已好一刻了。船老大用力的在撐着竹篙，他撑了好一會兒，便歇了手，以抽烟來安慰他的疲勞。</p>
<p>「今天行了多少路了？晚上，我們的船歇在那裏？」明兒嘴裏嘰哩咕嚕的唸着，而他的眼睛依舊望着野景，不敢開口，問那船老大，因為他曾有一次問這樣的話，而遭到船老大的不理。不過也有一回，船老大却很快的同答，因此他用這樣的話來試探船老大的答覆，是最適常的了。</p>
<p>「今天嗎？不過三十多里路，我們今晚一定要趕到嚴州，那是我的家鄕。」那知船老大今天是很高興而爽快的回答着，大概是他回家鄉的緣故吧。明兒也以為回家鄕是最快樂的一回事，可惜嚴州是他的家鄉，如果嚴州換了我的故鄕，那我今天在船上一定要跳起來。這時他心中起了一陣懊喪，不知道什麽時候，我們可以回到家鄉？</p>
<p>太陽漸漸地西沉，船老大兀立在高高的船頭上，一隻手罩在眼睛上，這樣可以遮蔽强烈陽光的刺目，更瞪大了眼珠向四周遙望着，這樣的看了一會，便比以前更用力的撑篙，同時命他的船夫們加快了速度向前背　，他很渴望早一些回家鄕而叙天倫之樂。</p>
<p>陣陣的歸鴉，哇哇的呌着，它們也好似奮振着翅膀，邊唱邊飛的趕回巢去，它們有的在先，有的在後，在比賽那一個最先回巢，便是最有幸福。</p>
<p>船兒漸駛漸近船老大唯一的目的地，屯溪雖也是他的目的地，不是是他金錢的目標罷了，他張大了血盆似的嘴，從他滿臉的皺紋中透露出一絲絲的笑容，一隻粗糙的手指着東北向，而頭對着那和他相反感覺的明兒說道：「那邊有烟起的許多房屋，便是我的家鄕了。」明兒也隨口的答應着。</p>
<p>盞盞的燈火也慢慢地明顯了。那時太陽已鑽人地平綫下去。船兄已進入了嚴州的河口，兩旁沿岸的船很整齊的一行行的排列着。那船老大興奮似的東也照呼，西也呌應，好似打了勝仗般的回鄕。在經過一艘和他差不多龐大的船時，那船老大便開口對明兒說：「這是我老兄的船。」在那邊船頭上立着和船老大面貌很相像的人，不過軀幹比較矮小了一些，定是他的老兄了。</p>
<p>到了這時，江山船好像很快的駛去，後來才歇在一艘很大的船旁邊，那是船老大的家了。船還沒有停穩，船老大便放下了篙，很快的跳到那船上去了。</p>
<p>好奇的明兒，倒底要看看船老大的家是什麼樣兒的。到得船一停住，他們一夥兒也擁到那船艙裏。那船是大得多，艙裏的設備也很完備。明兒眼見得那船老大手抱着一個孩子，再牽着比較大一些的一個，這無疑的是他心愛的兒子了。船老大的母親，枯燥的臉上帶着笑容來招待他們，倒茶拿櫈，忙個不了，船老大的大兒子更開着留聲機來款待他們，很表示出這種招待也算是周到的了，可是船老大的妻子。這天很不幸的病釗在牀上，沒有見到伊的芳容。船老大更回到江山船上，去船艙下拿出了兩隻從杭州帶來的鷄，可惜一隻巳經死了，去給他的母親，可見他對他母親很孝順的，對於家也是念念不忘的。船夫們也帶着烟斗來了，他們躺在籐椅上，很寫意的抽着烟，一縷縷的烟繚繞在船篷裏。船老大和他母親談着明兒不懂的土話，大概不外別後在杭州緊張的情况。留聲機放出了「小桃紅」的調兒，明兒在平時聽得厭惡了，不過在離別了家鄉好多日子的現在，也覺得有些回味。談話聲，音樂聲，抽烟聲，一番歡樂的氣象充塞在整個的船篷裏，明兒受不了烟味的薰炙，悵然的走出了這個船篷，回划冷寂的江山船中，追憶到自己家鄉的樂趣，竟不禁淌下幾顆眼珠，直　到他乾燥的嘴裏，畢竟有些苦澀的回味。</p>
<h3>做一個小無綫電家（八）</h3>
<p>— 奚人</p>
<p>四，裝天綫和地綫</p>
<p>王民的堂哥先把天綫絕緣子繩案那樣的　在一處，然後在屋頂的兩尖頭上縛兩根竹頭，再把做好的天綫　在竹頭上，那根天綫上的引入綫就從屋面上穿下來，一直連到房間裏的收音機上為止。但是要注意，引入綫的皮綫一定要買新的，切不可買舊貨，因為舊的皮綫上破的地方很多，破處碰到了其他的地方，從天綫上來的無綫電，就要傳上，其他的東西逃去。</p>
<p>王民看他的堂哥在屋頂上把天綫架成了以後，就問：『哥哥，天綫就這樣算完全了？還有其他的東西嗎」？</p>
<p>他的堂哥聽了他的話，向屋頂上張好了的天錢看一看，又想了一想，然後說道：「嗯，天綫差不多完全了，但是，來，民，我們來看看」。</p>
<p>王民和他的堂哥走到引入綫的旁邊又仔細的察看一遍，看看有沒有不妥當的地方。四周一看，覺得已沒有地方不妥當了，然後對王民說：「民，好了，天綫已做完了，現在我們來開始做地綫吧」。</p>
<p>「地綫不是結在自來水管上的嗎」？王民問。</p>
<p>他的堂哥回答說：「這裏的地很多是水門汀的，打鐵棒很不容易？所以結在自來水管上也是一樣的一。他的堂哥一面說一面就把買來的皮綫分開來，量好了尺寸，正巧够從自來水管處接到房屋裏的收音機上。他的堂哥一面在做，一面又對王民說：</p>
<p>一民，你看好了，是這樣做的：先把皮綫上的包皮刮到乾凈了，露出黃銅的銅絲，刮到長短差不多有一尺的樣子，然後再把自來水管也用刀刮去表面上的垃圾，刮淸了以後，就把銅絲繞上去。這樣，地錢就成了」。</p>
<p>「地錢做好了那麼做什麼呢」？王民聽說天地綫都已做好了，他就來不及的要做收音機了。果然，他的堂哥回答他道：「可以做收音機了」。</p>
<p>王民的心裏眞是快活極了！</p>

<h3>沿路遊戲</h3>
<p>— 子系</p>
<p>朋友！只要大家稍稍留，心一點的話，沿路儘可看到三三兩兩的孩子們，在玩着「打彈子」，「打菱角」，「跳繩」。「踏跑冰鞋」，「追人」，「騎自由車一等種種遊戲。本來遊戲是應該的，是有益的，而目原是兒童本能的表演。但是做遊戲，要是在遊戲塲，在健身房，在學校或家庭的空地上或空室內，當然一點沒有什麼關係。要是沿路遊戲，不免就有許多的危險發生了。試看往來的行人這麽擁擠，各式的車輛又是這麼衆多。一個不留神，危險立刻就造成。我親自見過行人的皮鞋踏破孩子的手；汽車的輪子軋傷孩于的腿，踏跑冰鞋的孩子撞倒路上的行人等等，據我的朋友們說：這類危險的事實，也已數見不胖了，這種事實，已為租界捕房當局所注意，嚴飭沿路巡捕加以禁止，違者帶入捕房拘罰，或就地棍擊。但是巡捕的視綫，那裏能够注到整個馬路的任何一處呢？何况靈敏的孩子們遙見巡捕到來，早已走開，所以孩子的沿路遊戲，仍然極形發達。</p>
<p>小朋友！前面說過遊戲是應該的，是有益的，但是千萬不要隨便的沿路遊戲啊！</p>

<h3>勤有功嬉無益</h3>
<p>— 静園小學六年級生　周杏</p>
<p>我們中國人，勤少嬉多，但近年來一般人突覺悟到勤的可愛，逐漸勤於工作，所以各樣事業都有發展，勤的益處有好幾種，現在略分幾點來述：（一）假使有兩個人，一個愛勤，一個愛嬉，他們倆同時看一本書，勤的人在兩三天之內，就能看完了，並明瞭裏面的意思，接着冉看第二本，在同樣的時間裏又能多得到許多的知識。但是嬉的人呢？恐怕在一星期中這本書還沒有看完吧！裏面的意思更不耍說了，由此就司知道勤優於嬉。（二）　如有甲乙兩工人，都是泥水匠，有一天忽然有兩家請他們去造屋子，甲工人在造屋子的時候，總是休息，吸烟，浪費時間，所以他的屋子在一年中還沒有把屋子造好，自然賺不到一個錢了。但是乙工人呢？却完全和他扣反，他整天造着屋子，一息也不歇，直等一天的工作完了，才稍做些私事，房屋的主人，很歡喜他，時常在親友前宜揚他的勤，並把他介紹給朋友處造屋，所以他在半年中已造了許多的屋子，又賺了許多的錢。</p>
<p>嬉的害處，上面二種已明明的指出，旣得不到知識，又賺不到金錢，總之嬸是不能使事業發展。古語說：「業精於勤」，就是我們無論做什麼事，總須勤，才能精良。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們喜歡勤，還是嬉？假使是勤的；愈加勤起來。嬉的人；趕快改過自新來實行勤吧！耍知道嬉是無益而有損的。</p>
<h3>五月來了</h3>
<p>— 民生小學五年級生　劉繩遠</p>
<p>一天天翻着日曆，讓時光在怱忙中過去，猛的一看：日曆正呈顯出「五月」二個字，呀！被稱為國恥之月的五月，又跑到眼前了！</p>
<p>在中國，幾乎沒有一個月份沒有一個國恥的日子，說起來實在使人痛心，尤其是五月。國恥的日子最多，其中除了五月一日是國際勞働節，五月四日是學生運動紀念，五月十八日是陳英士烈士殉國紀念外，五月三日是濟南慘案紀念，五月七日是日本提出二十一條條件的日子，五月九日是想做皇帝的袁世凱承認辱國條件的紀念，五月三十日是上海慘案紀念。計算起來，竟然佔到所有國恥的一大半。</p>
<p>我們為什麽有國恥呢？雖然是因為列强的强權，但主耍的原因是因為中國人不知振作，自暴自棄，讓國勢一天一天地衰弱，於是外人就看我們好欺，用武力來壓迫我們，所以這實在是我們的恥辱。</p>
<p>不過，現在我國已揭閒偉大的不做奴隸的抗戰，全國都一心一意的抵抗外侮，我們不但耍盡雪國恥，而且要使國家强盛起來，我們在這樣轟轟烈烈的時代，一切都感到無上的光榮，任憑那一個個國恥來臨，我們都一點不覺得恥辱，更不覺得慚愧。</p>
<h3>怎樣學習算術</h3>
<p>— 工部局西區小學　張振馥</p>
<p>小朋友們，我們在學校裏所覺得最頭痛的課程是什麼？我想你們一定會說「算術」吧！但是，祗要我們能用心硏究；算術並非難學，並且還使我們感到興趣哩。怎樣硏究呢？</p>
<p>（一）多學習　算術和做作文一樣，不多學習便要生疏，所以要多學習，才能不感難做。</p>
<p>（二）熟記公式　公式在算術中是頂重要的，不可忘掉，否則就做不出來。</p>
<p>（三）仔細考慮　做應用題的時候，第一須了解題中的意義，然後再仔細地想一下，這樣的用心學習，不會做不對的。</p>
<h3>鞦韆的自述</h3>
<p>— 震東小學四年級生　祁進梅</p>
<p>我的名字呌鞦　，本來住在樹林裏我有許多同伴，有一天來了好幾個工人，他們把我和同伴砍倒了，賣給木匠店裏。那木匠的氣力眞大，把我做成一條一條的再給我釘起來，把我拿去賣給校中的先生。先生們把我放在一處操塲上，我怕學生來把我上面的繩弄斷，我就要掉下來，又怕把我推倒，後來我耐心等着，看有什麼動靜。等了一會有一個小朋友走來，坐在我身上，盪來　去，看上去他好像很得意。忽然來了一羣小朋友，那先來的小朋友，跳了下來，他們就爭先恐後的坐在我身上。有幾個竟　得比架子高，一失手跌下來，頭破血流。這都是他們自己不好，假使他們好好的和我做明友，就不會弄到如此了。</p>
<h3>白雪公主（十六）</h3>
<p>— 天孫</p>
<p>白雪公主的玻璃棺材，在森林裏放了好幾個月，伊長眠棺中，那副花容月貌，還是沒有改變。野花在笑着，好鳥在歌唱着，陪伴伊的寂寞。可是不上幾時，這玻璃棺材中美貌公主的新聞，巳四而傳佈開來，遠遠近近的人，全都知道了。這新聞終於達到了那位年靑貌美的王子耳中，頓時心中一動，懷疑到這位玻璃棺材中的畏眠人，就是那失踪已久的白雪公主，他惦記着伊，也已很久很久哩。當下他打定主意，定要去探看一下，於是毫不猶豫的跳上了他的白馬，立刻向着七矮人住的地方趕去了。</p>
<p>那白馬足不停蹄，好像追風逐電似的發刺刺地跑去，一會兒已到了那一帶森杯裹。他一見了玻璃棺材，一雙眼睛，立時模糊起來，竟淌滿了眼淚。他走近去瞧時，見白雪公主的艷屍，直僵僵地躺在那裏，一張雪白的臉龐，比以前更覺得美麗了。他情不自禁地低下頭去，在白雪公主氷冷的嘴脣上親了一下，作為永訣。</p>
<p>說也奇怪，白雪公主經了王子甜蜜的一吻之後，伊那僵臥不動的身體，忽然動彈起來，好像一個小孩子從酣睡中醒回來似的，把一雙緊閉着的妙目，慢慢地張了開來，劈頭就瞧見了王子，微微的笑了一笑。彷彿一朶美麗的玫瑰花，在春風中開放了，這當兒王子快樂得甚麽似的，連忙伸出兩條强有力的臂兒，從棺中抱起白雪公主來，眞的是愛不忍釋。原來這愛情的第一個接吻，竟打破了那王后青蘋果的妖法，王后害人自害，白白地犧牲了自己的一條性命而白雪公主却從此復活了。</p>
<p>那七矮人在一旁瞧着，也快樂得發瘋起來，大家打着旋子，彼此擁抱着，止不住的笑做了一團。樹上的小鳥們，也樂極了，合夥兄放聲高唱，幾乎迸破了它們的小喉嚨。森林裏所有兎啊，鹿啊，其餘的小動物們，也跳來跳去，歡聲動地，都在慶祝公主的復活。</p>
<p>王子心想讓白雪公主留在這裏很不放心，決意帶了伊一同回去。動身的那天，公主和那七矮人逐一的接吻吿別，大家依依惜別，很有些戀戀不捨。當時公主就答允他們，每年春季花笑鳥歌時，伊一定趕回來探望他們的。</p>
<p>到了這時，白雪公主的一寸芳心中，充滿了快樂，暗想苦盡廿來，伊那往時的好夢，終於實現了。王子把伊從地上抱了起來，一同騎在白馬上，他們的並頭雙影，在夕陽影裏漸漸遠去，一逕回到他的雲宮中去了。</p>
<p>從此以後，他們倆在雲宮中雙宿雙飛，一輩子過着幸福的生活。（完）</p>

<p>匯市昨日銀行扒風已息、以惟油洋行德士古曁其他各大洋行、雖相繼猛扒、期現英美兩金、但因英美等各外商銀行、供意依然濃厚、是以過程呆平、而猛鮮變化、結果英美兩滙、均無榮辱、半天成交尙旺、至港滙因錢兌業復來吐售、故形勢繼續略帶鬆硬、</p>

<p>上檔外債升起鎊許</p>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況、因受到任何刺激、希特勒演詞發表後歐洲戰氛瀰漫、並未消散、此後問題錯綜復雜、殊非短時期所可解決、市塲人心、因此恍惚、前日一度興奮、又成過去、此後市價、似將成盤旋之局、昨日市况經過開盤因北帮略有吸收、市價雖緊、繼天生聯和以及散戶浮多出籠、乃轉疲象、三十八號始終賣出、現貨仍有流出、午前結果仍小二角左右、午後因週六關係、交易極淸、市價此後穩定、聯和震康五號及十六號均係賣出、德孚則繼續買進、二十號等亦稍有進胃、但市價結果、仍小一角左右、成交總數的計五十餘萬元、茲列簡表於後、</p>

<h3>雜糧　大連黃豆　路貨高於現貨</h3>
<p>大連黃豆市况、雖曾一度在拋售路貨時回軟、但其潛勢得明暗銷塲活潑之支持、最近三日來、不受油價回挫影響、其他各豆因貨品非標準化、雖不合於榨油銷塲、（後每祖大速豆少出一二斤油）、然本街出。去路、仍絡繹不斷、且以時令攸關、到存允稀、市况樂觀、昨成交現大連豆四車、價為九元二角及二角一分、路貨妥成二車，價比現貨反高、現貨價開九元二角二分、其他平湖杜豆做開三百餘包、價為十元零五角、三角崇明沙黃四百包、價自九元一角半到八元九角半、蕪湖豆二百包、價為九元二角三爭、</p>

<h3>紗花　偽幣暴跌引起北銷　現紗直綫上騰</h3>
<p>市塲上祇聞一片買進聲</p>
<p>雙馬抬至四百三十四元</p>
<p>售價橫跳十元須防反動</p>
<p>紗市暴騰、漲風之劇烈、為本年來所未見、新高峰層出不窮、查其原因、謂日偽貨幣日跌、引起種種猜疑、北帮又轉入華紗市塲搜羅允切、於是技機商鑒於空氣緊張、買意愈强、一片買聲瀰漫市上、大有紗荒之象、恐慌之狀、達於極點、大家互相拖進、爭先恐後、以致漲風愈演愈熾、遂呈直綫上騰之局面、午後買聲震動於市塲以外、售價立刻橫跳七元、二十支雙馬外棧現貨價為四百三十四元、比上日價再跳十元、然只聞買者、不見賣戶、茲據大衆議論、須看四百五十元之價、因之做多者仍方興未艾、不過十分漲高後、一旦反動亦不能不防也、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、以傳言紛紛、買氣仍盛、開價即跳六元、二十支雙馬現紗價為四百三十元、其他中身貨亦隨之迂迴前進、旋以獲利者吐出、又復回挫一二元、迨至收盤仍屬平靜、豈料午後開盤、市情大變、因內地帮需要興旺、市况陡緊、賣者寥寥、市盤由此步步橫跳、買戶亦不問情由、只顧拖進再說、如此形狀、未免過於在暴也、迨至收盤、變馬做到四百三十四元、棧單價為四百二十五兀、查全日各帮買去統計三千四百八十五包、上日午後成交五百七十包、兩日總計四千零六十包、行情二十支雙馬天女兩牌比上日價均漲十元、其他粗細紗亦漲五元·七元不等、廠方由利泰廠開出十八支醒獅一百包、價為三百七十五元、二十支醒獅五百包、價為四百零五元、信和廠開出二十支五子一百包價為四百十元、六月至九月、崇信廠開出十支大發五百包價為三百三十五元、五月份統一廠開出十支金鷄三百包、價為三百三十二元、利泰廠又出二十支醒獅二百包、價為四百包、榮豐廠開出二十支金橋花絨灰白紗三百包、價為四百七十五元、明日出口紗有四百四十五件運汕頭、七百件運香港、三百八十件運廣州灣、九十五件通北海、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>日紗市塲、繼續狂漲、且扶搖直上、因北帮客人不問一切、窮收濫進、多說囤戶收藏、因偽幣跌價、北帮買貨、然此種情形、亦未免過暴也、二十支藍鳳紗漲出四百元關外、</p>
<h3>棉花無大生氣</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、先因聆及希特勒之演辭、略跌三五磅音、嗣後市面轉形混亂、近漲遠跌、收盤時銀行價及海外棉商俱有購進、結果近期漲八九磅音、遠期漲四五磅音、昨日印棉連同預測漲一羅比、埃及棉漲十餘磅音、折合法幣、計美棉及巴西棉每担漲九角、印棉漲三角、埃及漲一元二角、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來因偽幣暴跌、引起華北紗銷、加之南昌收復、人心大為好轉、紗價已迫近四百五十元、衆料紗價尙有上漲可能、各紗廠亦擬乘此漲風甚熾之時、將開遠期棉紗一批、屆時各廠將大量補進原棉、惟値此歐洲政局緊張、故廠方暫作觀望、靜候各方面之發展也、茲將昨日棉市折合送廠價格列下、</p>
<p>本棉生意略形生色、但都係同業中採辦、廠方仍無舉動、故市情依然黯無生氣、新裕廠進美國棉僅六十件、其他廠商絕無辦胃、棉市前途、仍在超趄不前之中、但來源甚滯、蘇北一路雖未斷絕、然到貨寥寥無幾、僅三百七十包、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<h3>絲茶　輯里絲</h3>
<p>外銷頗為活躍　廠經法銷開展</p>
<p>國外絲市、昨橫濱因天長節停業、紐的里昂現貨、均無上落、紐的交易所近期漲半分、遠期漲二分、絲市已臻堅穩之境、絲價可望盤升、本埠絲市、昨絲交甚形活躍、但僅限於輯里經、白廠經美銷、據聞七八分一七五〇元發電、仍未能為洋行接受、怡和等行、昨進輯里經六個號子及高級輯里經近一百二十担、市價蛟四月初漲三十元、白廠法銷、久吿停頓、日前B字等級發電一七〇〇元、昨已得回音、計成交九十担、此後法銷或能更轉熱鬧、邇來用戶絲市甚疲、白廠B宇普通牌子售開一六八〇元、而交易甚屬零星、</p>
<p>昨有絲四十件、茶葉一千四百件進口、均自香港運來、又今日有茶葉一千五百箱運歐洲、</p>
<h3>新毛茶山價高昻</h3>
<p>龍井旗鎗售價巳跌</p>
<p>時値新茶登塲之際、詛浙東突形緊張、甬溫等埠時遭在炸、致海口封鎖、交通中斷、宰本市各製茶廠、日前曾紛派人員、分赴浙屬寗紹溫州等埠及湖州一帶、準備收買新毛茶、運滬製銷茲悉寗紹方面、上虞新茶開價、竟達一百一十餘元、空前高峯紀錄、溫州毛茶、亦在五十餘元左右、聞近日仍在相持觀望中、至湖州方面、採辦困難、觀察兮年本埠洋莊茶營業、一時頗難開展、至內銷之店莊茶新龍井·旗鎗·等貨、日來價格、均巳降低二三十元不等、新龍井由一百四五十元跌到一百一二十元、旗鎗由一百元關降至七八十元之譜云、</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖產價加鬆</h3>
<p>昨糖市據外電、產價略有回鬆、申市雖仍上漲、但有轉定之象、公會劃盤、二四粗白轉口貨初做十九元五角半、後微鬆為十九元半、本棧現貨二十七元八角、共成交三四百包、太古車白拋價復緊、七月份港幣一〇·七五、尙未肯發電、現貨西棧B嘜二十七元〇五分、後為二十七元、荷赤轉口貨、十二元一角、二百包、十二元一百包、國糖開出佳太赤七十包、十五元七角、莊片靑五十件、十元四角、刁靑一百五十包、十三元八角、均升一二角、二十九日自汕頭來糖二千二百七十件、</p>
<h3>紙張　錫箔市價轉平</h3>
<p>鍚箔售價、在滬浙交通被阻時、曾見一度上升、然滬上存底充實、行囤多趁高吐出、且自淸明節後消化日淡、旺銷季節須待夏秋之間、因此市價逐步回平、目下高檔九八的軍正對每條售價七元、連二最高每塊為一元五角四分云、</p>
<h3>藥材　黃梔子貨缺軋漲</h3>
<p>黃梔子自泉貨斷到、迄將兩月、致行家深感缺乏、邇來北帮有需要、最近某號由汕頭遝來二紅梔三十件、業已開通、其價較前市軋漲七八元、聞後批貨不日可到、市勢堅穩、</p>

<h3>疋頭　業內外放價收買　棉布漲風殊可畏</h3>
<p>國布白貨暴騰五角</p>
<p>東疋現貨無人出售</p>
<p>國布</p>
<p>昨市繼續瘋狂上漲、投機心思熱烈、同業與金融界業外國戶一再放價收買、白貨粗布粗斜·細布·細斜最為鋒俏、漲價一角以至五角、晨市少數同業獲利吐售、成交粗布三百件、細布·細斜二百餘件、午後賣戶漸吿絕跡、市盤混亂、開價相差每疋半元之巨、色布漂白布以客銷呆滯、存底甚厚、漲勢較弱、染廠工作、極度淸閒、蓋此時購進坯布漂染後、發售均難敷成本、漂染布疋、以粵廣州灣購額較盛、計辦漂布·府綢·色布·色斜四千餘疋、天津帮辦府綢·條漂布五千疋、本街及川滇帮均出取定貨居多、囤戶購囤藍布色斜亦達四五百箱、多數廠家以此時售盤過苛、寗願上棧、待價而沽、故連日各堆棧存貨、滿坑滿谷、新戶頭難覓儲貨之所、</p>
<p>東布</p>
<p>白貨市面在漲、漫無止境、昨以日紗飛騰、謠言孔多、金融界購囤殷切、採辦細布。細斜下月期（因本月現貨已無人出售）貨、達四五千件之鉅、同業震驚、相顧失色、十二磅龍頭細布售盤在跳七角、同業中措手不及、皆不知其所以然、而向各洋行承開者、亦達四千餘件、內細斜祇十分之一、開價如後、</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>疋頭出口、一日將有一百九十件運汕頭、二百三十件運香港、一百件運廣州灣、九件運北海、一百四十件運海防、</p>
<h3>糧食　麵粉廠盤</h3>
<p>猛漲一角</p>
<p>麵粉　日昨本廠現粉市况驟吿猛漲、二號粉廠盤開市即行喊高、蓋緣近日來本客銷化迭見活躍、各廠早有加價之表示而國際情勢、日益險惡、德元首發表之演詞、頗與糧價前途有關、是以連日國外產價步升、原料價格日高、且目下市上現洋粉亦巳稀少、廠粉暫無軋脚可言、因此廠盤堅持、上午到過四元五角之價、但廠方尙不肯售出、僅本街及零星客戶微動、後市漲至四元五角半、始稍有供給、聞北洋帮尙有整批交易、未曾妥實、大致均須待諸下週初再行公佈云、</p>
<p>洋粉　國外定價又見報漲、達期定貨、迄難合劃、市上現粉供源日蹙、雖有存貨、均執住不願輕脫、更兼廠盤猛漲之下、貨方喊價、亦提高五分至一角不等、但購戶尙鮮熱烈垂靑、除本街零星交易外、整額成交、續吿擯　云、</p>
<h3>粳秈囤戶　動辦復濃</h3>
<p>行市激漲二三角</p>
<p>杜粳各帮來源、河下到南港三四號、車輪包子、僅蘇同帮一千六七百包、來貨旣被阻撓滬市人心遂昂、本街及囤戶均相拉進、售方乘機扳高、一時形勢混沌、結果厚薄粳升起二三角、包子貨悉在十四元許、而河下亦在十三元七八角、照此情形而論、倘來貨續少、則後市似難遏制、杜洋埠尖亦皆漲一角、變元隨梗市並升二三角、</p>
<p>客秈自甬帮辦存未克付裝後、市面本有趨平之望、且江輪來源絡繹、存底逐漸加厚、故行囤辦　並不見貪、然邇日本街進戶以內地羊杜尖到少價昂、羊尖漲至接近十五元、隨紛起改辦客秈、昨日本街店舖工廠各戶納胃均宏、成交數加至四千包以上、中關機秈與　米消化允佳、行情乃續昂一二角、洋米因本客秈速日步漲西貢大市貨乃喊至十七元三角許</p>
<h3>南北貨　青島生仁出口　仍被限制</h3>
<p>靑島訊、該處生仁出口、仍有限制、故乏運申、產價比木月上旬、又漲元許、西南口仁十五元柬口仁十五元一二角、東西洋莊及油坊辦過一萬〇五百包大粒仁十五元四角、辦二千包花生菓平平、王台生十一元至十一元二角、高宓生十二元、成交二千包、</p>
<h3>蜜棗來源斷絕　存底漸告匱乏</h3>
<p>蜜棗市存漸竭、如禿禿均已吿乏、咋聞某行尙存有超蛋數桶、呌價竟至一百四五十元、蓋自甬甌兩航綫相繼對鎖後、無從運滬故也、</p>
<h3>五金　馬口鐵銷路旺</h3>
<p>昨日五金交易、天津·烟台·靑島·諸帮、均有點綴、但數不多、本埠蛋廠猪油作生意較暢、以馬口鐵銷路獨旺、如九十磅雙連美貨售七十三元（有膽）及七十元（無　）、一百磅雙連美貨售八十八元（有膽）、及八十六元（無膽）、九十磅雙連意貨售六十七元、一百磅雙連意貨售七十七兀、九十磅單連英貨售三十四元、一百磅單連英貨售三十六兀、查開出共達三四百箱之多、</p>

<h3>世界博覽會的奇妙</h3>
<p>— 特也</p>
<p>紐約世界博覽會定今天開幕，該會概況，已於本月十九日載見本欄，那是由路透社發表的，美國基督科學箴言報會載關於該會情形的一文，紀述和前所登的不同，本報且覓得該會鳥瞰全圖一幅，故將那文節譯，附於圖後，讀者按圖索驥，也可如過屠門而大嚼，若能因此引起讀者的興趣，親往一遊，得益定不小哩。</p>
<p>一九三九年四月三十日開幕的紐約世界博覽會，可謂光怪陸離，包羅萬象。那綫顯而為雅俗共賞的，有各種新穎的娛樂，那深奧而非智者不能洞明其義的，有各種巧思的構製，形形色色，無一不能引人入勝。其中文化的，科學的，工業的藝術品，最佔重要部分，更可貴的一點，卻是博覽會所抱的主旨，－－「今日的豐美，總不及明日為佳」。凡科學和發明以及幻夢在今日所能窺見的　明日世界的一切，在這次博覽會中都儘量展露，所以除使遊者得到消遣的樂趣之外，還給他們「在今日想像明日」的一種啓發。</p>
<p>博覽會的原址，以前是糞土之堆，費去了三千萬金鎊，才告落成。全場佔面積一千二百十六英畝，步行遊覽一周，須費八小時的時間。全場有出入口八處，無論遊者從那一入口而進，總會走到「主題中心」，那裏有兩種全會最特異的建築，一是一個巨球，一是一條高柱。（見圖中央）由這中心點展佈十四重要部分，每一部分代表現代生活的要點，佈置各各不同，使遊者每至一處，有不同的感覺，絕不致誤以此處為他處。凡現代的文明，無不包括在這十四部中，它們的名稱是：政府部，出產部，運輸部，交通部，分配部，商業制度部，居室衣服化妝品部，營養部，衛生部，公共幸福部，教育部，健身部，美術部，宗教部。全場又可分為三大主要區域：（一）會中當局和私家工業的展覽品；（二）外國與會者和美國的展覽品；（三）　　淺草湖一的娛樂區域。</p>
<p>圓球是一個直徑達二百呎的空心球，上裝活動梯兩架，一小時能容八千人上下。那是一個極美的地點，因為四周的美景，在此可以一覽無餘。遊客先至高柱基下，又入升降機，而在離地五十呎的球邊一洞入球內部。巨球的本身，重九百三十萬磅，用每根九噸重的柱子八根支住，柱子都製成鏡面，有噴泉八道，不斷地射在鏡上，所以巨球好像浮在空間似的，入夜更見精彩，那時有力的電光射出雲彩，使這巨球好像在軸心上徐徐的轉動一般。</p>
<p>那球內的月裏每秒種移動一呎，在五分半種內可燒畢內圈一周。那時遊客可飽覽四周的美景，那是以「民治」為名，代表「明日的花園城」。同時柔和的詩聲，傳入耳中，那詩是名詩家史蒂爾氏替博覽會特寫的，抬頭還可看見高處有雄赳赳的隊伍，一面走着，一面唱着博覽會的歌曲。</p>
<p>巨球和高柱有一橋相通，巨球之下有瑩瑩發光的碧池，過橋便入環繞碧池的螺旋式的闊走道，在此道上可以　見會場的全部。高柱是三邊式，用鋼製成，根基處每邊廣六十八呎，向上漸漸收小，頂高距地七百呎，那柱是供無綫電播音之用的。</p>
<p>重要次於「主題中心」的，是「立憲蔭道」，那是展覽區的中央場所，也是全會的中心，在巨球高柱的東北約一哩，直達一大湖為止。那湖聯接展覽區政府區外國區，那裏有小瀑布，小池，噴泉，側面有散步之地，上種大樹千餘株，特地由他處移來的。其中點綴着許多雕刻石像，著名雕刻家佛里特蘭德氏所手成的「四種自由」，即代表出版宗教集會言論四種自由的作品，也在其列。還有一架長五十呎的日　儀，取名「光陰之性」，是曼希浦氏的作品。最令人望而起敬的，卻是高六十呎的華盛頓石像，他於距今一百五十年前在紐約就美國第一仟大總統職，這次博覽會，便是為了這個紀念而舉行的。「立　陰道」的每面，都有巨廈，高四五十呎的墻上，　着圖畫，還裝飾着鑲嵌細工的作品，描寫人類自原始時代到今日的進步。</p>
<p>自「主題中心」起，有大路若干條像扇形一般向外展佈，另有一條橫幹路，以廣大的弧形貫通半徑式的各大路。這條幹路取名「虹路」，因這一區域的色澤和電燈光，都有特別的佈置，故取此名稱。在白書中「主題中心」右面的屋宇，都現着藍色，漸向「立憲蔭道」走去，色澤漸漸化紫，到了蔭道，轉成紅色，然後向左而行，漸漸化為橘色，到了極左之處，轉成黃色。那「虹路」也隨着這個方式變化色澤，夜間卻用和建築同樣顏色的電光，射在全路，五色繽紛，更覺美麗悅目，「虹路」真像一道長虹。</p>
<p>「立憲蔭道」的另一端，有周圍廣八百呎的大湖，夜間用水，火，聲，色，佈成美景，堪稱奇觀。其中設一千個射水管，射水高達一百五十呎，每六個水管聚成一簇，而使射出之水，成一水柱。射水環之一，直徑九十呎，射出之水，成各種花樣，其中一種，狀如高九十呎的一束金色小麥。射水管射成各種花樣外，患有無臭的煤氣管，噴出各種色彩的火焰，以及火焰噴出形形色色的精緻。並配以音樂；有四所大放聲室把樂聲放大，真是水火交清，聲色相和，盡技巧之能，極視聽之娛。估計這湖的一帶，可容五十萬觀客，患有許多人能由四周餐館等等的好坐位，和在蔭道兩旁數千休憩椅子上欣賞這個奇景。</p>
<p>「淺草湖」之上，也有一種奇景，其中遊船十餘樓徐徐駛行，用探照燈照耀如同白書，還加上各種特製的大電燈，當焰火船活動之際，滿湖全是焰火，成一罕有的偉觀。</p>
<p>這兩種娛樂所用的燃料，由兩家公司共同供給，用直徑達八時的燃燒器，另備附件，以會經化學手續的木層和其他有色的雜物，陸續藉機械輸入器中，而成素色的火焰，「淺草湖」上所射出高一百五十呎的有色火焰，是用二十四呎彭生式煤氣燃燒器製成的。</p>
<p>「明日之城市」是估十英畝面積的「家庭建築中心」的主要特色，其中築有一切完備的家庭住屋約二十種。這是使家屋的建築師對於居家房屋的構造，和對於現在各種材料的配合，以及內部裝飾陳設等等，得到進步的思想。</p>
<p>外國區域的建築，是集古今而為一，古式的遠在數千年以前，新式的可認為「超現代化」。埃及國的會所是古王法老時代的廟宇一所，法國是現代式的圓屋，英國是莊觀的巨廈，羅馬尼亞的是仿古時拜占庭的奢侈規模，意大利的是採取古繩馬和現代的交點，挪威是仿造十七世界的御邸，日本是具東方建築的典型，波瀾是一座中古時代的堡壘和一所黑玻璃的屋宇。其餘各國，各具特式。外國區域中的飲食，以地理區別，遊客在一日中，可遍嘗全世界的食品，如在巴西進晨餐，在捷克（按著者草此文字，捷克還未亡國。）進午餐，在英倫進茶點，在荷蘭東印度進晚餐，在法國進宵夜。</p>
<p>藝術館陳列的全是上乘精品，大都以古代名畫師的手筆，以及十七八十九世界歐美名畫的精萃為限。音樂館能坐二千五百人，可稱國際音樂大集會的繼衆。</p>
<p>娛樂區域佔地二百八十英畝，以大弧形展主競技塲以外，而沿着「淺草湖」，那是興趣新奇，兼而有之。在這區域的南端附近，有一座高二百五十呎的降落傘塔，豫備著十一個裝飾華麗的降落傘。遊客先登塔頂，後再坐在傘下，機關一撥，便飄飄而下，如同從飛機上降落一般，卻毫無危險。其他引人入勝的，有「迷魂林」，魔術電光等等，患有用機械運動的人造動物，稀奇古怪的表演，到此地者，都樂而忘倦。各種娛樂，以類分部，比方外國村莊，古巴和法國的同在一部，「小老紐約」獨自為部，騎馬和驚人的玩耍，合成一部</p>
<p>又在「兒童世界」中另開一遊嬉場，派人專管。男女兒童到了「兒童世界」，可以隨意遊嬉，休息，進餐。裏面有各種運動，取樂之外，還含著教育性。自四歲以上的兒童，都可得到合於他們年齡的娛樂。</p>
<p>「航海廈」的入口，每邊的正面，造成兩艘大郵船船首的形式。一座半圓形側廳，一部分包圍一池，池裏泊著形式完備的遊船和快艇，並沿着一　墻造成上下兩層的甲板，而跨過小池。高一百五十呎的桅杆上分出的桁上，卻滿掛着旗綵</p>
<p>「航空廈」陳列着橫渡大西洋的大飛機模型，另有大飛機一架懸在天空，推動機旋轉不息，顯然是在飛着。該廈入口面，前有面積廣二萬六千呎的空塲，其中停着新式飛機若干架，最新式的飛剪號，也在其列。</p>
<p>「航海廈」和「航空廈」之間，有「摩托運輸廈」。展覽品中的特點之一，便是「火箭門」，那是表示「明日世界的旅行」，使遊客因此可以想見火箭飛行的景象。那火箭船用一架大起重機的磁鐵塊舉起，放在火箭砲的裂口中，寂靜一霎那後，發出耀目的閃光，無聲的爆炸，於是那火箭船便飛入以太層中，以太是用一個滿播明星的大天幕權代。</p>
<p>教育是「站在文明和焚刦間的大力量」，所以在世界博覽會中佔重要的一席地，仿佛成了一個教育部，由紐約大學校長郤斯博士任主席指導一切</p>
<p>「中央廳」一帶佈置了許多雕刻像，噴泉，小瀑布。四周種着世界各地特產的植物二十五萬株以上，還連着百餘萬株名花，萬紫千紅，如入花國。</p>
<p>博覽會的當局豫料開幕之後，春夏兩季的遊客，總數可超過六千萬人。紐約是世界的最大城市，這次博覽會，是世界博覽會中規模最大的一次。</p>

<h3>富連成科班演戲特點</h3>
<p>— （燕雁）</p>
<p>北平富連成科班，它是全國第一個大科班，造就　人材，不知有多少，例如于連泉（小　花），馬連良，譚富英，李盛藻，毛世來等，都是該社的畢業生。從前我在北平求學的時候，極喜歡聽該社的戲，這因為該社演戲的確有特點，而為其他私人組班出演者所不及的。現在閑着無事，把它寫了下來，以供海上人士的參考。</p>
<p>（一）富連成每日所演的戲，都非常着硬，它並不以角兒呌座，純粹以戲為號召，因為社中人材的整齊，任何一齣戲，都不用一個乏角，完全以搭配整齊，演出生動為主。</p>
<p>（二）富連成的戲，齣齣都有一看的價值，自開塲起至大軸止，沒有過高低之嫌，較之其他各班頭三齣不堪入目者，大不相同。</p>
<p>（三）富連成的戲，最重規矩，不許偷懶，嗜戲者大可以過癮，學戲者足以取法，以　借鏡</p>
<p>（四）富連成的武戲，搭配整齊，緊湊非常，因為行眾多的緣故，演出的熱鬧，引入入勝，這是任何戲班所比不上的。</p>
<p>以上所述四點，是富連成社藝術上的優點；此外，因為社中學生無巨大包銀的緣故，座價得很低廉，這也是科班的特點，而不是私人組班所能辦得到的。再則富連成的學生，名伶的兒子居其大半，名伶對該社信仰非凡，於此可見富連成社在平劇界中所佔地位的重要了。</p>
<h3>天才小明星　胡蓉蓉痧症新愈</h3>
<p>— 正泳</p>
<p>主演「小俠女」與「木蘭出世」</p>
<p>看到好萊塢童星影片的源源而來，不禁要想起我們自己的幾個大堪造就的童星來了。說來也夠淒涼，自從上海變成了孤島以還，袛有去年　花一現的星光公司，有過一張天才小明星胡蓉蓉主演的「歌兒救母記」，這真使影迷們　殺戲癮和不免引頸長望了、目前，忽然聽說國華公司有邀請胡蓉蓉主演新片的話，便專誠到明德里胡宅去一詢究竟，現在把所探悉的，假「游藝界」一角來轉告關心童星的影迷們聽聞。</p>
<p>小明星痧症新愈</p>
<p>蓉蓉的天資，比別個兒童要聰敏伶俐得多，而體質也素來是健而美的。在今年廢　的新正，因為她的大弟弟再再出痧子，於是蓉蓉和小妹妹倩倩及患有一個小弟弟紀紀三人，也都被傳染而出起痧子來了。但經過情形很好，現在且已經完全復原，胃口大開，而精神也仍舊活潑潑地勝過常人了。不過她爸爸規芬先生，還讓他心愛的四兒女休養着，暫時不上學校，而在家中看書寫字和着着棋拉拉手風琴的玩兒，蓉蓉更把擠壓着的許多影迷來信，在逐一親自作覆或郵寄給影迷們索取的照片</p>
<p>小俠女先行開拍</p>
<p>至於蓉蓉主演的新片，即日就要開拍的有國華公司的「小俠女」一片，由歌星　秋霞等配演。當決定拍攝這張片子以前，大約在上月底罷，國華當局又會向她的尊翁商討過，預備在「小俠女」前，先讓蓉蓉主演「木蘭出世」。這張影片的劇本，是在去年十月初旬，已經由蓉蓉長兄胡心靈編就的。但後來又因為「小俠女」合同簽訂已久，應該先行結束，所以國華便收回新議，而把「木蘭出世」的劇本交還胡氏保存，待「小俠女」完成後再談了。</p>
<p>「木蘭出世」教育片</p>
<p>當時筆者便問起規芬先生，「木蘭出世」和「木蘭從軍」的內容是否相若。心靈兒便將前者的原稿出示，原來兩者根本不同，「木蘭出世」的內容，是述說木蘭幼年的生活事蹟，而含有多量的教育意味。這劇本是去年十月初旬編就的，國華張石川當時就想開拍，但　了古裝　備費時，便將原劇交還胡心靈而暫緩動手，現在舊事重提而又告中止，所以「木蘭出世」的劇本，便再度由胡氏收回了。</p>

<p>身之運用法（續）</p>
<p>身之位置第四表</p>
<p>無論何邊，第一　二兩式身之位置為初級者所常用，故不可不知道，第三第四兩種身之位置，高級溜冰者不能不用，溜冰花樣，做法各人不同，但全賴身之位置之變化。各人身之位置運用法不同，且每種花樣各有數種做法，各法各有長處，故不能說何者為必優，何者為必劣：全視個人宜乎用何法，故以後凡遇花樣做法，或示一法，或列舉數法，非謂含所示之法以外，並無他法，但袛能指示途徑，讀者當自生變化，當求在地上所畫花樣準確，姿態雅觀，不犯國際溜冰協會所訂規則可耳。因做法無呆章約束，最好各種做法均學會而擇取與自己最適宜最便利之一法。</p>
<p>各種轉身法，全賴此身位置之變動，故各種位置，果能熟練無遣，則進步必速，否則必遇困難。普通學者每邊之第一第二兩式，必尚能如意，但一到做四轉或換邊時，則手足無所措，因身之位置，不僅用前兩式，而完全與尋常姿態不同。故若不　每邊後兩式身之位置，則各種轉身法永無學成之日，而反覺各種高級花樣，無一易做者，其主要原因，即是身之位置錯誤耳。故若不及早就明瞭並一一練習之。則若不平途而廢，亦必枉費時間也。</p>

<h3>The Chinese Side's Mysterious Troop Movements Control the Northern Section of the Yuehan Railway; Xianning and Tingsiqiao Stations Are Recovered; Attacks Are Being Carried Out Successfully on Both the Northern and Southern Routes; One Unit, Taking Advantage of Victory, Directly Attacks Chongyang City Walls; Fierce Battles Erupted in Nanchang Yesterday Due to Japanese Reinforcements; Street Fighting Occurred Briefly in Fengxin; Wuning Was Also Surrounded by Chinese Troops</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Jiangxi Chinese army is still advancing towards Nanchang County; those attacking Wuning are only four or five li from the city; Japanese troops in Fengxin, Anyi, and Jing'an are all surrounded by Chinese troops (Special dispatch, 30th morning).</p>
<p>(Changsha) After the Chinese forces pursued the defeated remnants of the Japanese army from Tongshan to Xianning, a certain unit, using mysterious troop movements, suddenly appeared between Xianning and Tingsiqiao on the northern section of the Yuehan Railway on the morning of the 29th. Dividing into northern and southern routes, they launched attacks on Xianning and Tingsiqiao. The Japanese army hurriedly responded, indiscriminately firing artillery at the Chinese troops. The Chinese troops bravely charged the Japanese, and it is recorded that they recovered both Xianning and Tingsiqiao stations. The advance was still progressing smoothly as of the evening (Dispatch of the 29th).</p>
<p>Pingjiang: Chinese troops pursuing the enemy from Baini Bridge to Chongyang engaged in fierce fighting with Japanese reinforcements inside the city eight li from the city for a night. Japanese corpses littered the field, and they retreated into the city, attempting to fight to the death with their backs to the city. On the 29th, Chinese troops took advantage of their victory and directly assaulted the city walls. Japanese troops who fled to Ma'anshan northwest of Nanlin Bridge were still being surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese forces on the 29th (Dispatch of the 29th).</p>
<p>Fengcheng: The Japanese army in Nanchang has fallen into a situation of being surrounded on three sides. On the evening of the 28th, more than a thousand Japanese reinforcements attempted a counterattack. Fierce battles erupted between Chinese and Japanese forces in the eastern suburbs, and neither side could gain the upper hand. Furthermore, a major fire in Nanchang City has not yet been completely extinguished (Dispatch of the 29th).</p>
<p>(Changsha) Seeing that the situation in Nanchang was hopeless and beyond recovery, the Japanese army has now concentrated its main force between Anyi and Fengxin, attempting a final desperate struggle. On the morning of the 29th, more than two thousand Japanese reinforcements came from Anyi, joining with the original Japanese troops in Fengxin to launch a counterattack against the Chinese army. The Chinese army displayed its divine might, fiercely striking the enemy head-on. After multiple decisive engagements, by 5 PM on the 29th, the Japanese army was finally defeated. The intensity of the fighting was unprecedented in recent days. In this battle, countless Japanese soldiers were killed, and two mountain guns, over 350 poison gas bombs, three light machine guns, over 60 rifles, and many other military supplies were seized. The remaining Japanese troops retreated into the city, while another unit retreated to Tao Xianling. The Chinese army is currently pursuing them in victory (Dispatch of the 29th).</p>
<p>(Changsha) The Japanese army in Nanchang is now surrounded on all sides by the large Chinese army. The Luojinta stronghold in the southeastern corner of the city, the Japanese army's only stronghold, was captured on the 29th by a Chinese division commander leading a suicide squad. A certain commander-in-chief also personally directed the attack on the city from the front lines (Dispatch of the 29th).</p>
<p>Fengcheng: Chinese troops besieging Nanchang had already occupied the old airfield on the 26th, and plainclothes teams inside the city also began to respond. After holding out until the morning of the 27th, Japanese reinforcements counterattacked, and the Chinese army retreated to the new airfield for a time. That afternoon, reinforcements for the Chinese army gradually arrived and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army, retaking the old airfield and continuing to advance. The Japanese army in Nanchang is in chaos and is about to collapse (Dispatch of the 29th).</p>
<p>Shanggao: More than a thousand Japanese infantry, multiple tanks, and over ten artillery pieces, covered by Japanese aircraft, fiercely attacked the vicinity of Dacheng on the morning of the 28th. The Chinese troops fought fiercely, and the battle was extremely intense. In the afternoon, the Japanese offensive faltered, and the Chinese troops launched attacks from multiple directions, defeating the Japanese army. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft was shot down, three Japanese tanks were destroyed, and over 400 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded (Dispatch of the 29th).</p>
<p>Fengcheng: The battles south of Nanchang are still in fierce contention. A certain unit of the Chinese army has advanced to a certain place more than ten li north of Liantang, intensifying the siege of Nanchang (Dispatch of the 29th).</p>
<p>Fengcheng: Chinese troops who recovered Shengmi Street have continued to make progress and are advancing north. Furthermore, although the Japanese army at Wanshou Palace has been stubbornly holding out due to reinforcements, after multiple encirclements by the Chinese army, its collapse is not far off (Dispatch of the 29th).</p>
<p>Zhangshu: This afternoon, a Japanese aircraft flew low over Gao'an to scout and was hit by Chinese anti-aircraft machine guns, crashing near the suburbs of Gao'an. The Chinese side is currently searching for it (Dispatch of the 28th).</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to reliable sources in the Chinese military, it is currently impossible to predict whether the Chinese army will be able to recover Nanchang, as the strength of the Japanese reinforcements arriving from Jiujiang is still unknown. The Chinese army's counteroffensive is not aimed at recovering Nanchang, as the location has already lost its importance to the Chinese army. The true value of this decisive attack lies in disrupting the Japanese army's immediate plans to attack Changsha. If the Japanese army wants to concentrate its forces for another attack, it will still take several months. Another value of this decisive attack is that it has dispelled rumors that the Chinese side is seeking peace with Japan on Japanese terms. This decisive attack has already shown the world that China is prepared to continue the war of resistance and is unwilling to negotiate peace (Dispatch of the 29th, Associated Press).</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to today's Chinese report, the Chinese army has already broken through the outer defensive works of the Japanese army in Nanchang. The two wings of the Chinese army have also cleared out Japanese outposts from the east and west. The vanguard of the Chinese army has already charged into Nanchang and is engaged in fierce street fighting with the Japanese army. The left wing of the Chinese army has already occupied Shijia Street, Xincun Xu, and Wanshe Street, while the right wing has crossed the Fu River and occupied Fulin Street, and has also occupied the Nanchang New Airfield, five miles from Nanchang. Two thousand Japanese soldiers have moved south along the Gan River, hoping to defeat the Chinese army, but have been repelled at Xiliang Mountain and Zhangjia Mountain. Fierce battles have occurred in Qingyunpu, and the Japanese army has been repelled. Chinese troops surrounding Fengxin are putting pressure on the Japanese garrison. Yesterday, Chinese troops entered Fengxin and engaged in fierce street fighting with the Japanese garrison for several hours before withdrawing. Japanese troops in Wuning are also surrounded. Yesterday, five hundred Japanese soldiers from Ruoxi, covered by twelve tanks and three Japanese aircraft, attempted to break through the Chinese army's encirclement of Wuning, but were ultimately repelled. Today, the Japanese army is attacking again, and the battle is still ongoing (Dispatch of the 29th, Associated Press).</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources received here, the right wing of the Chinese army attacking Nanchang has crossed the Fu River near Wuyang and is continuing to advance towards Nanchang. According to the latest front-line reports, the Chinese army has reoccupied the New Airfield six miles southeast of Nanchang. At the same time, another unit of the Chinese army occupied the old Nanchang Airfield and the railway station on the 27th, establishing contact with other Chinese troops besieging Nanchang.

<p>Stricter Regulations to Be Imposed on Import Trade</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to today's financial circles, the Chinese government is currently considering implementing stricter controls on import trade. The government believes that during this time of war resistance, the trade deficit is enormous, and the import of luxury goods is shockingly high. Therefore, it has ordered customs to prohibit the import of such goods as much as possible. At the same time, when merchants apply for foreign exchange to purchase foreign goods, they must choose essential goods to be approved. This plan is in accordance with the government's policy of protecting foreign exchange stability. At the same time, the government is currently striving to increase the export of Chinese products such as tung oil and silk (Dispatch of the 29th, Associated Press).</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Hitler's Reply to Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Two weeks ago, US President Roosevelt sent a telegram to Germany and Italy, putting forward several very concrete suggestions and asking for a reply. Hitler actually solemnly scheduled his reply for April 28. When the date arrived, Hitler did indeed broadcast his reply, but President Roosevelt, at the time of his speech, paid no attention, indicating that he did not wish to listen. This is truly a humorous matter! The wording of Hitler's reply was already anticipated by the world. Even if he provided any promises in his reply, his promises have never been worth a dime and were insufficient to cause a sensation. Furthermore, President Roosevelt's telegram was less of an inquiry and more of a declaration or warning; the other party's reply, or lack thereof, was fundamentally inconsequential. So, despite Hitler's energetic performance, the audience instead ignored him.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt said that recently two countries in Europe and one in Africa have lost their independence, and a distant country in the Far East is being trampled underfoot. If this situation is not stopped from developing, then a major world disaster is imminent. Therefore, it is necessary to demand that the aggressor countries stop this aggression and maintain world peace. Hitler's reply, however, stated that the responsibility for the loss of independence of those three countries lies entirely with the 1919 Paris Peace Conference and the Treaty of Versailles, and not with the current perpetrators. This kind of talk is the fundamental theory of the aggressor's philosophy of aggression. Hitler saying this on the one hand indicates his quibbling excuses to President Roosevelt; on the other hand, it is nothing less than a declaration that he will continue to apply this aggressive theory and continue to implement his insane acts of aggression. This can be said to be the most important point of Hitler's speech.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt specifically listed thirty countries, large and small, demanding that the aggressors provide assurances that they would not use military force to attack these countries for ten to twenty-five years. He also said that if the aggressors were willing to do so, President Roosevelt would notify the countries in question, asking them to make the same assurances, and then convene an international conference to establish lasting world peace. Hitler, regarding this point, first used a trick to trick the small countries into confessing that they had not been threatened by Germany, and then used these coerced confessions as arguments to give President Roosevelt a hollow reply. He also stated that convening an international conference would not be sufficient to solve the problems, and that Germany was fundamentally unwilling to join so-called arbitration-style meetings. However, the focus of President Roosevelt's question was purely whether the aggressor countries were willing to abandon their policy of aggression. As long as the aggressor countries were willing to change their attitude, the sincere cooperation of the remaining democratic countries would not be a problem. Hitler is certainly no fool; could he not understand that the solution to the problem lies entirely with the aggressors themselves? Yet he deliberately made these changed points of excuse, that is nothing more than expressing that his desire for aggression will never be satisfied, and he is currently unwilling to change his attitude.</p>
<p>Having recognized that the central idea of Hitler's speech is the unchanging attitude of aggression, then his simultaneous announcement of the abolition of the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact was a natural action, not surprising. Moreover, Hitler and his comrades will certainly continue to use aggressive means in the future, attacking any weakness in the world.</p>
<p>However, if we believe that Hitler's speech has already declared the destruction of world justice and the despair of peace, that may not be entirely true. From Hitler's speech, we can also fully see a kind of outwardly fierce but inwardly weak attitude. On the one hand, he made grand pronouncements, elaborating on the philosophy of aggression; on the other hand, he was full of peace and talked about sincerity. Although his promises are never fulfilled, at least it indicates that he does not yet dare to openly challenge, or that he is not yet willing to be the leader of aggression today. Because, from a subjective point of view, Germany's own strength is not yet qualified to be the leader of a second world war. At the same time, the triangular alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan has recently had the possibility of splitting due to Japan's hesitant attitude. From an objective point of view, the strength of the democratic front has been strengthened due to Britain's implementation of conscription, the near completion of Anglo-Soviet talks, and the increasingly concrete anti-aggression stance of the United States, etc. If Germany provokes rashly at this time, the result will inevitably be to fall into a quagmire. With Hitler's astuteness, could he not see this? So, the abolition of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, rather than being a strong expression of Germany, is more that Hitler felt threatened by the environment, deliberately putting on a show to cover up his inner panic. Because those agreements had long been regarded as waste paper by the aggressors, the formal abolition is really not a problem.</p>
<p>The direction of Hitler's actions in the future may be to pressure Poland to resolve the Danzig and Corridor issues, and at the same time to make so-called demands to Britain for the return of colonies. However, whether he will launch these new offensives, and whether he will persist in his aggressive attitude, still depends on whether the countries of the democratic front can quickly complete a collective security organization, and exert a united force to extinguish this flame of aggression. Before launching new offensives, Hitlers may also use their usual tricks, using divisive tactics to break up the democratic front, implementing a strategy of divide and conquer. This point is indeed more worthy of attention than his speech, and we ask all peace-loving countries to pay attention!</p>
<h3>Japan Unwilling to Conclude a Military Alliance with Italy and Germany; The War of Aggression Against China Has Reached an Impasse; Perhaps Wanting to Leave Room for Maneuvering; London Circles Attach Great Importance To This</h3>
<p>(London) Today, all the newspapers here are focusing on the fact that the Japanese Five Ministers have been discussing the issue of changing the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance for several days. It is generally believed that although Germany is putting heavy pressure on Japan to achieve its goal, the alliance has not been established. The fact that Hitler did not mention Japan in his speech seems sufficient to confirm this view. According to a telegram from the Tokyo correspondent of the Times, prominent non-political figures are very averse to this kind of alliance, or deeply aware that this move contains endless troubles in the future. This can be seen in their private conversations. Although they are not in political circles, they occupy a rather high representative position among the Japanese. Some newspapers believe that the greatest concession the Japanese government can offer is to ally with Germany only to resist the Soviet Union. This coincides with the opinion expressed to Reuters by well-informed Japanese people in London, that is, Japan will only participate in the European war when attacked by the Soviet Union. According to qualified observers, the Japanese navy is also very opposed to this kind of alliance, because it is completely incompatible with Japan's traditional policy. However, President Roosevelt's appeal to the dictators and the deployment of the US fleet to the Pacific have indeed caused an unfavorable impression on the Japanese who do not wish to antagonize the United States. Officialdom also holds the view that the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan will not be established. Recently, Japan's attitude towards Britain has been more moderate than before. The fierce anti-British attitude, which was almost a threat a year ago, has visibly weakened, and it seems more willing to listen to British advice. Now, if it is thought that the British government is busy with matters in Europe and will forget its interests in the Far East, this is a great mistake. According to Reuters, the situation is exactly the opposite. As for the means to be used, it will naturally depend on the trend of events. The Financial News newspaper has a long article criticizing the almost complete failure of the Japanese attempt to control foreign exchange and imports in North China. The fact that commerce has not completely stopped seems to be due to the Japanese probably being aware of the seriousness of the problem, so they have not made a firm effort to implement all the new regulations. However, it is uncertain when the Japanese will take this action, so it is impossible to place long-term or even short-term orders. The progress of the recent Chinese army offensive has been given close attention by the general public. Chinese sources may be overly excited, but there is no doubt that the Chinese army has won solid victories. However, when military observers met with Reuters, they doubted whether it was a wise move for the Chinese army to try to recover famous cities such as Nanchang and Guangzhou in the current stage of the war. After the recovery, although there will be a great effect on morale, on the one hand it will force the Japanese army to make a comeback, so the initial hopes of the Chinese army may inevitably be destroyed by this. The "kite of peace" still flies intermittently in the sky, but it is not clear from which side it is released. At present, there is clearly no possibility of building a bridge so that the two belligerent countries can communicate with each other (Dispatch of the 29th, Reuters).</p>
<p>Japan is Deeply Wary of the Soviet Union; Heavy Troops Stationed in Manchuria; Border Defenses Fortified</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from here today, Japan is still wary of the Soviet Union. Although Japan's war against China has entered a stage of all-out struggle, Japan still has heavy troops stationed in the "Manchukuo" area. For example, a very large airfield and aircraft depot have been built near Changchun, and the one in Hailar is even larger in scale. At the same time, troops are often transferred back and forth, showing military might. Defenses have also been built and troops stationed in the Inner Mongolia area. Troop ships patrol in the area adjacent to the Russian border. Although the defenses built cannot be compared to the scale of the Maginot Line, strongholds, artillery forts, anti-aircraft gun positions, gas stations, and ammunition depots have been built in all strategic locations, with cavalry used for communication. Here, they are paying close attention to the talks between Britain and the Soviet Union, fearing that the results of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations will be unfavorable to Japan in the Far East (Dispatch of the 29th, Associated Press).</p>

<h3>Military Affairs Committee Production: Outline of Battlefield Propaganda</h3>
<p>(D) Key Propaganda Points for the Enemy and Puppets: (1) Propaganda work directed at the enemy is a direct attack on the enemy in political warfare. It attacks the enemy from the spiritual aspect, shakes their will to fight, disintegrates their morale, and promotes the trend of anti-war mutiny and awakening to come over to our side. Its effect is sometimes greater than that of armed combat. (2) In the second phase of the War of Resistance, propaganda directed at the enemy is not only more necessary but also has a greater possibility of smooth development. First, the Japanese pirates' war of aggression against China is not for the benefit of the entire country but for the benefit of a small number of privileged classes, that is, a small number of ambitious warlords (the violent faction within the military) and some shameless enemies of bureaucratic politicians. Even within the military cliques and financial cliques, there are often open and secret struggles due to uneven distribution of spoils. At the same time, the people of Korea and Taiwan, who have always been under the control and enslavement of the Japanese, also resent them and never forget to take the opportunity to break away. The above situation provides us with an opening to carry out propaganda against the enemy. Second, because China is fighting heroically, the Japanese pirates' strategy of "quick victory" and the conspiracy of quick peace have failed. The war has been prolonged indefinitely, and as the international situation becomes more and more isolated, the burden of military expenses is increasing day by day, and it is difficult to collect taxes. Therefore, the mood of the people against the war and the soldiers weary of war is increasing day by day, which makes it more convenient for us to carry out propaganda against the enemy. Third, after the War of Resistance entered the second phase, the enemy's superior weapons became less powerful, and they had to hesitate to venture deep. Because it is not easy to obtain superficial victories in military affairs, the exaggerated and deceptive propaganda that has always been carried out has suddenly lost its effectiveness. Therefore, in the second phase of the War of Resistance, foreign aggression has lost its role in easing internal conflicts and has instead become the cause of promoting internal conflicts. The collapse of the Konoe Cabinet and the internal contradictions of the Hiranuma Cabinet are clear evidence of this, which gives us a great convenience to carry out propaganda against the enemy. (3) Our War of Resistance against Japan is different from the Japanese military's aggressive war. We are fighting for national survival and national independence, and we are fighting for world peace and human justice. Therefore, in propaganda, we are also justified. Not only do we not use deception in domestic propaganda, but we also do not need deceptive means in propaganda against the enemy. We only need to state the truth directly and cite facts to shatter the enemy's deceptive propaganda, which is enough to become powerful propaganda and gain the trust of enemy and puppet officers and soldiers. Therefore, (A) we must understand how the Japanese soldiers and the Japanese military's war of aggression have caused enormous damage to them and their country. The war gives them and their families only hunger and death. For their country, it only consumes national power and lowers its international status. The only ones who benefit from the war of aggression are a small number of warlords and financial groups and their lackeys. We must tell them the difference between friend and foe. The enemy of the Japanese soldiers is not China but the warlords who are in charge of the invasion of China. China, in the position of sympathizing with the Japanese soldiers' anti-war, is their absolute friend. At the same time, tell them that this kind of anti-war struggle has the support of the people who love justice at home and abroad and the democratic countries who are willing to maintain peace, and China is their backing. Therefore, their only way out is to change the aggressive war against China into an anti-war war to overthrow the domestic warlords. (B) We must tell the soldiers from Korea and Taiwan that their desperate sacrifice for the small number of Japanese military and financial groups in China only increases their own suffering and intensifies the oppression and exploitation of the Japanese. They can only take the opportunity to rise up, turn the weapons in their hands, and strike at their true enemies, the small number of Japanese military and financial groups, in order to gain national and personal liberation and freedom. (C) We must tell all the puppet troops that they should not be deceived by the propaganda of the Japanese pirates and traitors to fight their own brothers and be cannon fodder for the enemy. They should think about it. When they are forced to the front line, their families are suffering from the oppression and surveillance of the Japanese pirates, and they are starving and working as beasts of burden for the enemy. They must turn their guns around, kill the enemy and puppet officers, and come over to our side to drive out the enemy pirates and recover the lost territory. (4) In order to increase the strength of our political offensive and the effectiveness of our propaganda against the enemy, we must treat prisoners of war favorably. The highest leader, in his work on the War of Resistance, should pay special attention to the points that indicate "striving to capture prisoners of war alive and treating prisoners of war favorably, and prohibiting the killing of prisoners of war. Treating prisoners of war favorably is not only a matter of humanity and international law, but also a matter of convenience in combat and political propaganda. Strive to win over prisoners of war to help us with our propaganda against the enemy, and disintegrate the puppet troops and shake the enemy troops, because this kind of treatment is enough to show: (A) Our benevolence and the enemy's violence, and attacking the enemy in the political aspect. (B) Shattering the enemy's deceptive propaganda that China kills prisoners of war, eliminating their fear, reducing their resistance to the death, and avoiding our unnecessary sacrifices. (5) Our method of treating prisoners of war: First, we must respect their personality and do not hurt their feelings. Treat them as our friends and strive to transform them into comrades-in-arms who will overthrow the Japanese military. Second, we must first reassure them. The wounded must be treated before interrogation. Third, do not threaten or deceive them during interrogation. Be patient and do not expect to get results immediately. Keep their secrets and do not allow reporters to take pictures or interview them at will. They must be sent to the rear as quickly as possible. Fourth, after they are sent to the detention center, they must be actively influenced and educated.</p>
<p>Discipline and Spirit</p>
<p>(Chou) Discipline and spirit of battlefield propaganda personnel.</p>
<p>Propaganda workers are in a more difficult environment and bear a greater mission. Therefore, they must have a spirit of arduous struggle. After the start of the second phase of the War of Resistance, the highest leader and the minister have given earnest instructions to the political workers on the discipline and spirit that they should abide by in their speeches to the political workers. (1) Regarding discipline, the highest leader said in his speech to the political workers' conference, "Political workers must show correct influence on officers and soldiers in their lives and actions, so that they will not only not doubt but also believe, and then all work will be implemented without failure." The minister also gave specific instructions: "In addition to the original regulations, the following principles are hereby formulated for political work discipline: "Set the discipline of the troops according to the labor of the people." "Set the achievements of political work according to the discipline of the troops." Battlefield propaganda workers must strictly abide by and practice what they advocate in order to correct people's absurd concepts of propaganda work. (2) The progress of propaganda work is closely related to the self-cultivation of the workers. Therefore, propaganda workers must work hard to cultivate themselves in order to gain the belief of the people being propagandized. First, they must set an example. The highest leader instructed us, "The attitude and actions of political workers must be fair, and their lives must be frugal. The so-called "teaching by words" is not as good as "teaching by example, and the speed and magnitude of influence are great." The minister instructed, "Our political workers must also do propaganda in their lives, and take the life before money equal to the life of the soldiers and the life in the rear equal to the life of the people as the standard. Propaganda should be based on practicing what one preaches, not empty talk. Second, they should have the service spirit of communication soldiers and cooks. The minister instructed, "Our political workers should have the spirit of communication soldiers, "getting up early and sleeping late," these are all very important work creeds. Only by doing these two points can they be respected and become a role model. In the battlefield, doing propaganda work, including propaganda work against the enemy, should have the spirit of a cook, "working before the troops and resting after the troops." Third, they must study, learn, and reflect at any time. We should study carefully, learn carefully, and reflect humbly at any time and anywhere, according to the people and the events, and accept the valuable experience of blood to create our new way of working for victory. (Note) Regarding "the current situation after the start of the second phase of the War of Resistance," it has been seen in the Outline of Propaganda for the Second Phase of the War of Resistance previously issued by this department, so it will not be recorded again.

<p>Tearing Up Non-Aggression Pact</p>
<h3>Germany Severely Threatens Poland, Attempting to Seize Danzig, Poland Expresses Determination to Defend Territorial Sovereignty, Willing to Resolve Danzig Issue on Equal Principles</h3>
<p>Danzig Free City: In the speech delivered by German Führer Hitler today, there was a section involving the city of Danzig. National Socialist Party members all expect that the city will be incorporated into Germany on May 1. Police leave has been temporarily cancelled, and the Stormtroopers of the National Socialist Party have also been ordered to be on standby. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Danzig City: Last night, the people here listened to Führer Hitler's speech to the Reichstag with a joyful mood. They were deeply impressed by his statement that "Danzig cannot belong to Poland forever" and believed that the return of Danzig to Germany was only a matter of time. (Haitong dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler's speech has been commented on by experienced observers who believe that Poland is now in the same situation as Czechoslovakia in 1938 and will be sacrificed to Germany's eastward expansion policy. However, Führer Hitler will go to his villa in Berchtesgaden for a rest after the celebration of National Labor Day on May 1, and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will also go to Hungary next month to return the visit. (The Hungarian cabinet members are scheduled to arrive here tomorrow.) It can be seen that Germany may not take any action against Poland immediately. As for the plans Germany intends to implement, they will mostly start with propaganda to incite various ethnic minorities within Poland, which is no different from what they did to Czechoslovakia. At the same time, they should also make diplomatic efforts in Southeast Europe, especially in Romania, to isolate Poland. However, this kind of plan takes a long time and is much more difficult than dealing with Czechoslovakia before. This is also admitted by German political figures. Observers also said that Germany has long coveted the Ukrainian region and recently proposed to Poland that they jointly conquer it, but Poland refused to accept it for fear of becoming a German appendage. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>German Note</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German government has sent a note to the Polish government, announcing the abrogation of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of January 26, 1934. The reason for this is the same as for the abrogation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935, stating that the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact stipulated that the signatory countries should not use force to resolve disputes. Now Poland has concluded an agreement with Britain, promising to provide assistance even if a conflict that could occur between Britain and Germany is initiated by Britain. This is in conflict with the German-Polish Pact. Regardless of the form of the Anglo-Polish agreement, it should be regarded as a real alliance aimed at Germany. This can be seen from the process of the agreement and the current international situation. Poland would rather abandon the security provided by Germany and accept the promise of assistance from a third country. In other words, it is unwilling to adopt a friendly discussion method to resolve the outstanding issues between the two sides. The intention is obvious. As for the fact that the existing alliance treaty between Poland and France was established earlier and recognized by the German-Polish Pact, this is different from the nature of Poland joining the British alliance system five years after the establishment of the German-Polish Pact and cannot be generalized. "In short, the actions of the Polish government are willingly serving a policy initiated by other countries, a policy aimed at encircling Germany. Looking back, Germany has always pursued an extremely friendly policy towards Poland, and has taken into account all the interests of Poland. The fact that Poland and Hungary were able to connect their territories was achieved thanks to Germany's assistance, which can be used as proof. Germany also wants to seek a solution to the only outstanding issue between Germany and Poland, the Free City of Danzig, based on the same spirit." The proposal has been explained by Führer Hitler in his speech. This is the minimum reasonable requirement, and its intention is nothing more than to clarify the relations between Germany and Poland. However, the Polish government firmly refused to accept it and also carried out a partial mobilization, which shows that Poland believes that its answer is not enough to promote a friendly agreement. For the sake of Poland, if it could accept Germany's proposal, the Danzig issue could be resolved fairly, and the border between Germany and Poland could be firmly guaranteed by Germany, thereby enriching the good-neighborly friendship. Wouldn't that be a good thing? It is a pity that the Polish government did not do this, and the good opportunity was lost. Instead, it accepted political obligations from a third country, which is in conflict with both the spirit and the text of the German-Polish Pact and has unilaterally eliminated the effect of this pact. Although the German government does not intend to change its basic attitude towards Poland, it is still willing to conclude a new agreement with it. However, this agreement must stipulate "clear and binding obligations" for both parties. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Hitler's Speech: Like a Play</p>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler's speech lasted for two and a half hours. The slowness of his speech and the theatrical manner were unusual. The listeners knew that the key points were to attack the treaties of Britain and Poland. When Hitler read the names of the countries mentioned in President Roosevelt's appeal for peace, the house was filled with laughter. When he mentioned Liechtenstein, it also caused a big laugh. When he mentioned Palestine, the audience roared for half a minute. In addition to the 888 members of parliament, there were also tens of millions of people listening, because his speech was broadcast by radio to all corners of the earth. Hitler's attack on President Roosevelt's remarks was almost entirely as expected by the newspapers, so this part of the speech was not surprising. Everyone knew that Hitler would reject President Roosevelt's proposal, but now they just wanted to hear Hitler explain the reasons for the rejection in detail. The public believes that Hitler's speech may be the prelude to German newspapers strengthening their attack on Poland. In the past few days, German newspapers have repeatedly published reports of Poland's abuse of German expatriates. Political circles believe that Hitler's willingness to provide guarantees when various countries apply for guarantees is by no means accepting President Roosevelt's appeal. This kind of guarantee will be purely a matter between Germany and the countries concerned, so any infringement has nothing to do with a third country. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Polish Reply</p>
<p>Warsaw: After the German government submitted a note to the Polish government yesterday, declaring the abrogation of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934, the Polish government immediately submitted a reply, stating several things: (1) This treaty was initiated by the late Chief of Army Education of Poland, General Piłsudski, and not by German Führer Hitler. (2) The mutual assistance agreement concluded between Britain and Poland is completely in harmony with the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. In addition, Germany has already provided guarantees for the security of Italy and Slovakia, so why shouldn't Poland be said to be in conflict with the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact? (3) The Danzig Free City issue has always been considered by Germany and Poland to be a non-essential issue and not enough to cause a dispute. (4) Regarding the legal status of the Danzig Free City, the Polish government is still willing to discuss amendments with Germany in a friendly spirit, but it must be on an equal footing and take into account the interests of both parties. In addition, the Polish government should also propose suggestions such as: (1) The current system of the Danzig Free City should be maintained, but the post of High Commissioner of the League of Nations may be abolished. (2) The Free City should still be placed under the Polish customs system. (3) Residents of the Free City, both German and Polish, should be allowed to freely develop their culture. Foreign Minister Colonel Beck will deliver a statement in the House of Representatives in the short term to discuss the relations between Germany and Poland. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: After the German government sent a note to Poland, abrogating the Non-Aggression Pact of 1934, Polish Foreign Ministry officials are studying it. Official sources refused to comment, but sources close to the government claimed that Poland is always prepared to discuss all issues of concern to both sides with Germany, but any attempt to force Poland to accept any new measures by fait accompli or oppression will not only be rejected by us, but will also be given a proper response. As far as the issue of the Free City of Danzig is concerned, Germany and Poland have always agreed that bilateral relations should not be impaired by this non-essential "local" issue, but the German government's attitude has obviously changed. As far as the traffic money that Germany passes through the Polish Corridor is concerned, although Poland is prepared to give Germany various conveniences, it cannot allow the country to enjoy extraterritoriality in the Polish Corridor, because extraterritoriality has nothing to do with traffic issues and is enough to undermine the institutions of a sovereign state. The reasons given by the German side for abrogating the Non-Aggression Pact are nothing more than the fact that the newly established mutual assistance agreement between Britain and Poland is in conflict with it. It is well known that the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact has already stipulated that Poland may continue to cooperate with Western European countries. Moreover, Polish Ambassador to Germany Lipski requested a meeting with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on the 6th of this month, but was rejected by him. German Ambassador to Poland Moltke has returned to his country to report on his work and has not yet returned to his post, so Germany and Poland have been unable to make any contact since the beginning of this month. It can be seen how meticulously Germany is planning. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Danzig Free City: A Disturbance Occurred</p>
<p>Danzig Free City: Most Germans in this city have gathered at the crossroads since 11:30 a.m. to listen to the speech of German Führer Hitler in front of the radio broadcasting station. However, the attitude of the Germans is not consistent. Most anti-National Socialist Party members have distributed leaflets throughout the city, advising citizens not to listen to this speech. The Poles, who oppose everything, are even more out of the question. The local authorities, after the end of Führer Hitler's speech, printed the full text of the speech into a complaint and posted it on various thoroughfares, but it was mostly torn up by the anti-National Socialist Party members. The Standing Committee had no choice but to order the police to monitor it. In addition, many disturbances have occurred between Germans and Poles. Local National Socialist Party leader Forster has recently issued a book to the Stormtroopers, urging them to be calm and prescribing that the team will hold a large-scale exercise in the city in June of this year.

<p>Hitler's Speech: No Mention of Anti-Communism, Probably Wanting to Befriend the Soviet Union: This Point is Very Noteworthy</p>
<p>(Paris) German Führer Hitler's speech yesterday did not involve racism and communism. This point has been noted by observers here. It is said that after Hitler incorporated millions of Czechs into the German Reich, it would be unavoidable to give others a handle if he continued to call for racism. The intention of the communist stratum is more complicated. According to common sense, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and even Romania and Poland do not trust the Soviet Union. Hitler can use this as an excuse to attack the Communist Party. But now it is not the case, that is, the German radio stations have not attacked the Soviet Union since the last month. It is intended that Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin happened to arrive in the capital of Turkey yesterday. Since the Soviet Union and Turkey have maintained close relations, if Hitler attacks the Soviet Union, he will inevitably indirectly prompt Turkey to quickly join the collective security initiated by Britain and France, so he did not mention it. In addition, the relationship between Germany and Poland is becoming more and more serious. Hitler may want to please the Soviet Union so that it will refuse to interfere, or he may want to prevent the Soviet Union from establishing an agreement with Britain and France to guarantee the territorial integrity of Poland and Romania.

<h3>German Government Note: Unilaterally Abrogated Naval Agreement: British Naval Circles Believe It is Insignificant: Prepare to Submit a Reply in the Short Term</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to reports here, the German government has handed over a full text of Führer Hitler's speech to the US Chargé d'Affaires in Germany as a reply to President Roosevelt's call for peace. The German Chargés d'Affaires to Britain and Poland also submitted a memorandum to the British and Polish governments at the same time, declaring the cancellation of the Anglo-German Naval Treaty and the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. The German memorandum to Britain recalled British Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration in Munich, stating that he and the German Führer both believed that the Anglo-German Naval Treaty was a symbol of the two Germans' shared desire to never wage war against each other, and that the German government often maintained this wish and continued to be encouraged by it. At the same time, it expressed regret that Britain's recent policies were becoming increasingly distant from those adopted by Germany. The memorandum ended by saying that Germany did not want the abrogation of the treaty to affect the provisions on the quality of warships, and hoped that this matter would contribute to avoiding unrestricted naval arms competition among countries. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) According to a Reuters naval correspondent, people here are not very surprised by Hitler's decision to abrogate the Anglo-German Naval Treaty, because this matter was expected. Although officials have not yet issued a criticism, naval affairs researchers generally believe that the abrogation of this treaty does not actually make much difference, because once the British navy is inspired, the German navy will in fact be unable to catch up. Germany's large-scale shipbuilding program will become a severe and heavy economic burden. Moreover, various warships, especially large ones, cannot be built overnight. Therefore, it is believed that Germany's naval construction seems to be focusing on submarines. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) The German abrogation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935 has been commented on by diplomatic figures here, saying that the British government will submit a reply in the short term, stating that this agreement cannot be abrogated at will, and that the supplementary agreement of July 17, 1937, which stipulated the exchange of shipbuilding information, is also of a permanent nature and will not expire until December 1942. Now that Germany has declared it invalid, it is legally unfounded. As for Germany's so-called "encirclement policy," it is also unfounded. On the contrary, the British government has not yet made any suggestions regarding Germany's willingness to provide non-aggression ties." (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt: To Deliver a Speech Today: To Make Another Appeal for Peace: In Order to Reply to Hitler</h3>
<p>Hyde Park: According to sources close to Roosevelt last night, Roosevelt may reply to Hitler's speech at the opening ceremony of the New York World's Fair on Sunday. Some observers believe that the US President will once again, in the guise of peace, criticize the arrogance of European totalitarian countries. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Times believes that Hitler's blatant demand for "living space" will be a disturbing factor in the situation, because his purpose is not trade but colonies. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Hitler's Verbal Onslaught, Roosevelt's Dream Undisturbed</h3>
<p>Hyde Park: The President's Secretariat has issued a public announcement stating that when German leader Hitler delivered his speech today, President Roosevelt was asleep. He only awoke at 8:20 AM, after the speech had concluded, and will not be issuing any comments on the speech.</p>

<h3>German Leader's Speech Evokes Reactions from Various Countries, Britain and France Believe It Has Failed to Ease the Situation, and Attempts to Divide the Democratic Front Will Surely Fail</h3>
<p>(London) The British press generally views Hitler's speech as having made little difference to the situation. However, some newspapers perceive ominous signs in Hitler's remarks concerning Poland. The Times states that the most significant aspect of Hitler's speech is his assertion that Germany has never taken action to infringe upon the rights of other nations. Hitler's audacious pronouncement implies that Germany is blameless in the current issues. If Germany genuinely desires cooperation, other nations would readily welcome it, including on the issue of colonies. In a peaceful and progressive world, anything is possible. Colonial powers such as Britain could consider sharing any specific benefits derived from their colonies with other nations on a reciprocal basis. However, in a dark forest, such things are impossible. The Daily Telegraph reports that Hitler's speech leaves the international situation unchanged. Hitler's true intentions remain undisclosed, merely confirming the suspicion that he is still filled with resentment. The Daily Herald suggests that Hitler seemed compelled to subtly imply to his own people that he would not be the instigator if war were to break out, creating the impression that war would not erupt immediately. However, even this impression is tempered by extreme caution, as Hitler's remarks about Poland contain malice and may prove to be the most significant part of the entire speech. The speech makes no mention of Britain's implementation of conscription or the Anglo-French talks with the Soviet Union, which is likely significant. Undoubtedly, Britain's recent actions and President Roosevelt's plea for peace have altered Hitler's tone. The lesson to be learned is to expedite the work that has already begun. The News Chronicle states that the general impression left by Hitler's speech is that he is attempting a subtle maneuver: appeasing Britain while threatening Poland to sow discord. Hitler's current attitude toward Poland mirrors his previous approach to Czechoslovakia, aiming to isolate it from the rest of the world so that he can impose his will and satisfy his desires. The Daily Mail reports that Hitler's speech gives people more hope for peace than a week ago. British officials consider the speech relatively moderate but question its sincerity. Whether the recent engagement is based on a genuine desire to maintain peace remains to be proven by future actions. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Parisian press views German leader Hitler's speech yesterday with suspicion. They generally believe that although the tone is more moderate, the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement have already been declared null and void. Hitler's exclusive favor toward France is clearly intended to divide the ranks of democratic nations, but this tactic is unlikely to succeed. Furthermore, Hitler's speech does not seem to contribute to easing the international situation, which remains unstable. The right-wing Figaro reports: "The main intention of Hitler's speech is to reassure Germany. The deleted telegram from U.S. President Roosevelt has triggered a major reaction within Germany, which is evident in this speech." Le Petit Parisien reports: "The international situation will not change due to this speech. Hitler's hostility is concentrated on Britain and Poland, while treating France with relative leniency. In reality, Britain, France, and Poland have already decided to unite and resist the current common crisis, and no one in those countries can be swayed by this tactic." L'Écho de Paris reports: "Even the most appealing statements from 'that' country cannot make it a nation of peace. We must continue to take precautions against that country to avoid future mistakes." L'Ordre reports: "Hitler's speech reveals undeniable difficulties and hesitation. He seems to be at a crossroads, still undecided whether to openly engage in war or continue using tactics of terror and intimidation while simultaneously proclaiming peace."</p>
<p>Socialist Party leader Léon Blum published an article in the party's newspaper, "Le Populaire," stating: "The issue of war and peace will be decided by actions, not words. Will Hitler take action? There are currently no signs of it. American intervention, the firm stance of Britain and France, and the formation of a united front of democratic nations may prompt Hitler to pull back from the brink, but it is not certain." (Havas, 29th)</p>
<h3>Peace Proposal Rejected, United States Greatly Disappointed</h3>
<p>(Washington) The government believed last night that German leader Hitler's speech in the Reichstag greatly diminished the hope of resolving European disputes through peaceful negotiations. The U.S. Congress also believes this speech is a harbinger of an imminent war crisis. The White House and the State Department have issued no formal criticism of Hitler's speech, but private comments indicate that Hitler's speech does not reduce the likelihood of war. According to sources close to the White House, officials are extremely indignant at Hitler's response to the U.S. President's recent peace appeal in this manner, considering it a diplomatic discourtesy on Germany's part. Government officials also state that Hitler's speech cannot be regarded as a formal response to the U.S.'s written proposal. Observers generally believe that the central question of President Roosevelt's telegram to Hitler was whether Germany would adopt a policy of force or be willing to resolve everything through peaceful negotiations. However, Hitler expressed opposition to both international conferences and the U.S.'s proposals. Attention is also being paid to Hitler's repudiation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, as it is expected to stiffen the U.S. Navy's construction program, just as it has done for Britain. Because Japan is already aligned with the Rome-Berlin Axis, the increase in Germany's naval power may become the main reason for the global naval forces to become intertwined. The only official criticism from the White House came from President's Secretary, Mr. Early, who refuted Hitler's claim that the President had disclosed his peace proposal to the world before sending it to Germany. Mr. Early stated that the peace appeal was telegraphed to Berlin at 9:00 PM (Eastern Standard Time) on April 14th and was announced to the press at 10:30 AM on April 15th. (Associated Press, 29th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the content of German leader Hitler's speech, with the exception of certain Communist figures who believe that the door to negotiations has not been completely closed, members of Congress generally feel that it has a negative impact. They say that a movement to revise the current Neutrality Act to facilitate the democratic countries of Europe has now been encouraged. In particular, Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is the most ardent proponent of facilitating the democratic nations, but has yet to express his opinion. The views of various congressmen are summarized below:</p>
<p>(1) Former Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Borah (Republican), declared: "All discussions regarding the issue of peace have come to an end due to Hitler's speech."</p>
<p>(2) Speaker of the House, Bankhead, stated: "This answer seems to be ambiguous, and is insufficient to maintain peace in Europe. Leader Hitler claims he wishes to maintain peace in Europe, but his speech is full of underlying threats of aggression."</p>
<p>(3) Acting Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Bloom, declared: "Historically, speeches that are sardonic and invert right and wrong should rank this speech as foremost. It can also be seen how the German people are numbed by Leader Hitler and follow his views. In short, although Hitler strongly argues that he wishes to live in peace with all countries, he almost immediately presented Poland with an ultimatum. This is his usual tactic, and the world should already be aware of it."</p>
<p>(4) Senator Bone (isolationist) from Washington State (Democrat) stated: "Although Hitler's speech is surprising, it contains nothing new. The nations of Europe have been in conflict with each other for over a thousand years. If war breaks out in the future, the United States must not get involved in the vortex." (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(5) Congressman Logan, a Democrat from Kentucky, said, "The speech can be divided into three parts: lying, evasion, and denial."</p>
<p>(6) Representative Fish, a Republican from New York and a major critic of the President's foreign policy, said, "I do not believe there will be a European war this year." (Associated Press)</p>
<p>Congressman Bloom, a Democrat from New York and acting chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said, "Hitler's speech lasted for two hours, but there were no new developments." (Associated Press, 29th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Commentary: Treaties Not Respected, Germany Cannot Be Trusted</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Sources here generally state that the main points of Hitler's speech were anticipated by the Soviet press last week, so it was not surprising. The announcement to abandon the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German-Polish Pact proves that agreements with Germany are worthless and reinforces the need to maintain close cooperation with peace-loving countries. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) When German leader Hitler delivered his speech yesterday, it was broadcast abroad simultaneously, but Moscow was unable to hear the full text because Soviet radio stations were also broadcasting programs at the same time, causing interference. Therefore, none of the newspapers here mentioned a single word about it last night. (Haitong, 28th)</p>
<h3>Aggressor Nations Colluding, Italian and Japanese Newspapers Voice Support for German Policies</h3>
<p>(Rome) Fascist figures here are offering unreserved welcome for German leader Hitler's speech today, and are endorsing his reaffirmation of the relationship between Germany and Italy, and express their approval for Italy’s advance into Albania. They hold that looking at Germany’s abrogation of the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement, one knows that the country has already determined to resist Britain’s “encirclement policy." Mussolini's spokesman, Gayda, published an article in the Italian Daily News, stating: "This speech is sufficient to indicate that Germany is powerful and strong, and how the country's power is extremely reliable, even its allied nations can depend on it in times of need. Leader Hitler has moreover reaffirmed the historical stance adopted by the Axis nations, and has issued warnings to the governments who, with offensive intentions, are attempting to safeguard the interests of imperialism." (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Tokyo newspapers are running Hitler's speech on their front pages with shocked expressions. An editorial in the "Asahi Shimbun" says that Britain, the US and France have implied that if war breaks out, Germany and Italy would bear the blame. Hitler's speech now fully proves the inaccuracy of this implication. They are trying to get what they believe is due to them without resorting to such terrible means, but the facts are the opposite. Although Britain and France are eager to maintain the status quo, they will ultimately lead the countries to war. Poland's arrogant attitude toward Germany is similar to Czechoslovakia's arrogance in September last year. Britain and Poland formed an agreement because of this, but the agreement did not contribute to a peaceful solution to the German-Polish dispute. Hitler has now clearly stated that he is willing to give a non-aggression guarantee to all countries, so Britain and France should seriously re-examine their policies. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" claims that Britain is using a dual policy of intimidation and compromise towards Germany, but Hitler announced yesterday his unwavering determination not to change Germany's foreign policy. If Britain does not change its provocative attitude, Anglo-German relations cannot return to normal. The only way to save the world from catastrophe is to respect the unity of the Axis powers, which are fair-minded and peace-loving. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Bulgaria Pessimistic about European Situation</p>
<p>Capital of Bulgaria: The conservative newspaper "Mir" was the first to comment on Hitler's speech, saying that things will now develop along new lines, and even more rapidly. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Southern Country Pleasantly Surprised and Shocked</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia: Officials here are all expressing their satisfaction because Hitler had mentioned Yugoslavia as a "friendly country". It is said that the dispute between the US President and Hitler has nothing to do with them. Hitler's arrogant wording when mentioning the US President's proposal has left the public with an unpleasant impression. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Hungary Relieved</p>
<p>Capital of Hungary: The initial reaction of the Hungarian press to Hitler's speech indicates that it is a load off their minds. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Lithuania Anxious About the Future</p>
<p>Kovno: Lithuanian opinion believes that Hitler's speech has not eased the overall situation, as they feel that the increasingly strained relations between Germany and Poland may cause disturbances in Eastern Europe. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3>Poland in a Distressed Situation, Romania Offers Sympathy</h3>
<p>Capital of Romania: German leader Hitler's speech has just been commented on by semi-official figures here, stating that of all the countries that have been threatened, Romania's ally Poland is the worst. Leader Hitler is again using his consistent tactics to try his best to comfort other countries in order to isolate Poland. This is exactly the same as the previous effort to comfort other countries in order to isolate Czechoslovakia. Although Romania was also threatened a few weeks ago (referring to Germany's various economic requests to the country), it is fully sympathetic to Poland's situation. However, given the situation, Romania must expedite negotiations with the relevant countries in order to safeguard its security. It is hoped that Germany will only consider the matter of the cessation of the non-aggression pact in relation to Poland, and will not take any immediate action. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>Capital of Romania: It is claimed here that the possible impact of the abrogation of the German-Polish pact will promote the development of Polish-Romanian cooperation. It is rumored that after Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu returns from London, the Balkan Entente countries will soon convene another meeting in Rome, at which the territorial demands put forward by Bulgaria will be discussed. It is expected that the Balkan Entente countries will remain as firmly opposed to territorial changes as before, but may be willing to express their agreement to Bulgaria regarding various plans for economic cooperation. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Romania Denies Ever Making a Border Request to Germany</p>
<p>Capital of Romania: German leader Hitler said in his speech today that Romania wanted to be contiguous with German territory, and was even willing to include the border area (referring to the Carpathian Ukraine region) under German protection. Responsible figures have denied this claim. Romania does not have this intention. What we are concerned about is that after Hungary's territory has expanded (the Carpathian Ukraine region has been occupied by Hungary), the direct transportation line between Romania and Germany has been cut off. However, we have never ignored the fate of the Carpathian Ukraine and Slovakia regions, and are determined to protect this transportation line. (Havas, 28th)</p>

<h3>Chairman of the American Peace Council Advocates Sanctions Against Aggressor Nations, Urges Congress to Take Immediate Steps to Embargo Arms and Loans to Japan</h3>
<p>(Washington) Frederick Libby, Chairman of the American Peace and Democracy Union, yesterday urged Congress to embargo arms and loans to Germany, Japan, and Italy. He told the House Foreign Affairs Committee: "If Japan continues to aggress and the United States cannot tolerate it, steps will be taken. We ask that cooperative relations with Japanese aggressors be terminated, and that arms and loan embargoes be placed against the government of that country." Mr. Libby declared: "If America uses its vast wealth for the benefit of peace-loving nations, it can hope to achieve peace." He also said that he does not believe that pointing out aggressor nations is as dangerous as allowing the world to be drawn into war. The Gei Yi Resolution embargoed arms to Japan but could not force Congress to identify aggressor nations. At the same time, California isolationist Republican Senator Johnson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he believed that embargoing arms to a certain country and identifying aggressor nations could lead to war. He said, "We have made efforts in propaganda and have taught the people that we cannot stay out of war. If America does not adopt a neutral stance, it is difficult to hope for peace."

<h3>Britain Preparing to Offer Germany Non-Aggression Guarantees, But Still Not Abandoning Collective Organization, Maisky Returns to His Post to Meet with British Authorities</h3>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources today believe that Britain may give Germany a non-aggression guarantee in response to Mr. Hitler's speech, so as to show that Britain does not hate Germany. However, no matter what means the government takes to negotiate with Germany, it will continue its micro-military plans and organize a large-scale European "Peace Front" on the one hand.

<p>Russian Aircraft Flies Directly to New York, Effort Falls Short, Forced to Land Midway, Plane Destroyed But Passengers Safe</p>
<p>Miscou Plains, New Brunswick: The plane piloted by renowned Soviet aviator Kokkinaki and navigator Gordienko was suddenly destroyed at 7 PM yesterday while completing its four-thousand-mile flight, and was forced to land on Miscou Island. Mr. Kokkinaki and Mr. Gordienko are sitting next to the destroyed plane today, waiting for a Boston rescue team to rush to their aid. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>(New York) Renowned Soviet aviator Kokkinaki, accompanied by his assistant Gordienko, departed from Moscow at 4:15 this morning, piloting the "Moskva" aircraft, attempting to fly non-stop to the United States via Iceland and Greenland. Local agents received a radio message stating that it had been forced to land at 47 degrees north latitude and 63 degrees west longitude, but it is not known whether it landed on an island in the Gulf of St. Lawrence or drifted on the sea. The aircraft's distress signal has not stopped, indicating that Kokkinaki and Gordienko are both safe. The Soviet Embassy has chartered a Grumman amphibian aircraft to fly to the sea area to rescue them. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<h3>Japan Holds a Meeting in Xinxiang, Seems to Have New Intentions Towards Henan and Shanxi, Fierce Fighting in Areas Along the Tongpu Railway in Shanxi Province, Japan's Three-Pronged Assault on Southeastern Shanxi Fails</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) It is reported by telegram from Chongqing that Commander Sugiyama, the Japanese commander of the North China Expeditionary Army, went to Xinxiang and convened a meeting, which seems to suggest new intentions towards Henan and Shanxi. (Special Dispatch, 30th Morning)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a Chinese source, fierce fighting is currently taking place in the areas along the Tongpu Railway in Shanxi Province, especially on the front line in Linfen. The Japanese army, entrenched in the occupied areas of China, attempted to break through the Chinese army's defenses but failed, suffering considerable casualties. Fierce fighting also took place in the Fushan area. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<p>A Certain Location: After invading central Hebei, southern Hebei, and southern Shanxi, the Japanese army invaded southeastern Shanxi on the 24th, attempting to attack the Chinese base areas. They launched a fierce attack simultaneously from three routes: northwest, south, and north, first occupying Fushan Anze, and then capturing Wanghezi Hongnanguan Qikou (south of Jincheng Tianjingguan). Among them, the northern route was the most fierce. The Japanese army, with a division of troops, was personally commanded by Commander Anan, and after occupying Wanghe on the 3rd, they advanced eastward, attacking important locations such as the Shuifengling Nanguan. On the 11th, they fled to Gucheng Shipan, threatening Huawu Xiangyushe. On the northern front, troops in Huima Wangjiapo Yukou and other places, were divided into five routes and headed straight for Zihongkou. A certain Chinese unit was surrounded, but fortunately, the officers and soldiers of the unit fought bravely and managed to break through the encirclement after six days and nights. At the same time, they turned to the rear of the Japanese army to harass them. A certain Chinese unit also divided its troops and marched north to Taigu, causing the Japanese to be exhausted. At present, they have been retreating step by step. Gucheng Quandian Shuifengling Wangtao and other places have no trace of the Japanese army, only relying on the three strongholds of Wanghe Nanguan Zihong to stubbornly resist. (27th Telegram)</p>
<p>Xingji: According to reports, Xu Bingying, the head of the guard battalion of the puppet army unit of Li Ying in Anyang, led 385 officers and soldiers, 231 machine guns, rifles, and pistols, and 57 horses to defect, and killed the Japanese pacification squad leader Tokun Sanlang, assistant consultants, and dozens of puppet army officers. (29th Telegram)</p>
<p>Xingji: The Japanese army in Shanxi has always used rice as its main food. Recently, because of the all-out offensive of the Chinese army and the frequent cutting of the Tongpu Railway, military transportation has been extremely difficult. Therefore, they forcibly took millet, sorghum, flour, etc., from Chinese civilians as food. (29th Telegram)</p>
<p>Xingji: On the evening of the 23rd, Chinese troops approached Pian Guan City, dividing their forces to guard the thoroughfare of Tonghe River, as well as Xiaopiantou (northwest of the city), Hejiayu Gaojiashangshihuiyuan and other places, and used strong units to attack the city gates. On the morning of the 24th, a part of the Japanese army was lured out of the city and was dealt a heavy blow. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army was defeated and fled eastward, and hundreds of the remaining Japanese army fell into an encirclement by Chinese forces. At noon on the 25th, a part of the Japanese army broke through to the west and detoured Xiaopiantou, engaging in fierce fighting with the Chinese army near Yuecheng. (29th Telegram)</p>
<p>Tongguan: On the 217th, the Japanese army in Quwo was reinforced by more than 3,000 from the north. A part of the Japanese army fled into Yicheng. At dawn on the 28th, the Japanese army ordered the remnants of Yicheng to attack a certain Chinese unit with two heavy artillery pieces and six field guns. The Chinese army bravely charged and killed a large number of Japanese troops.

<h3>The Three Major Fronts of Military, Political, and Commercial Affairs Creating a New Situation in "Pan-American Diplomacy"</h3>
<p>— A Passing Traveler from Huatun</p>
<p>The Air Effect of German and Italian Psychological Strategies (Continued)</p>
<p>Special Correspondence from Our Paris Newspaper</p>
<p>(6) Among the countries of Central and South America, the most difficult to coordinate with the United States is Mexico. Since the Mexican government confiscated foreign property, its feelings towards the United States have been extremely negative. The figures in power there are either extreme left-wing communists or extreme right-wing national socialists, who find it difficult to get along with the United States. The current Mexican government's political tendency leans to the left, similar to the ruling party in Chile. The government is supported by labor unions. On the other hand, those who oppose the ruling party are national socialists who receive assistance from large merchants in Mexico City. In the 1940 presidential election, the national socialists may be elected, but in terms of political nature, they are still not allies of the United States. Currently, the person who is making great efforts to act as a peacemaker between the United States and Mexico is Cuban political authority Colonel Fulgencio Batista. This gentleman arrived in Washington, D.C., last November, and then visited Mexico City, intending to establish a deep foundation of friendship between the United States, Mexico, and Cuba. Furthermore, the labor unions in Mexico City have recently taken the lead in the labor unions of North, Central, and South America. The International Labor Union Conference held in Mexico City last September was attended by more than a dozen countries, including the United States, Argentina, Puerto Rico, Ecuador, Cuba, Chile, and Peru. The United States was represented by the bold and resourceful John L. Lewis, who did his utmost to connect with everyone. As a result, the majority unanimously agreed and proceeded to prepare for the Pan-American Labor Union Congress. The Executive Committee, which will be held prior to the Congress, is scheduled to meet in May this year. This is also an excellent medium for connecting North, Central, and South America as one, and it is sufficient to resolve the discord between the United States and Mexico.</p>

<h3>Chinese Troops in Northern Jiangsu Surround Siyang</h3>
<p>And Recapture Zhongxing</p>
<p>Taixian Communication: The Northern Jiangsu Chinese troops attacking Siyang crossed the river by wading on the night of the 14th and approached the suburbs. They immediately built cloud ladders to climb the city walls. At midnight, a daredevil team rushed into the city and encountered Japanese guards in street fighting. The Japanese troops, awakened from their sleep, responded in a panic, blindly firing machine guns and small cannons. The Chinese troops fought tenaciously. After several hours of fierce fighting, they finally killed dozens of Japanese soldiers. The county seat was temporarily recaptured. At dawn, the Japanese army increased its forces and pressed into the city, bombarding it with artillery fire. The Chinese troops then safely withdrew. At the same time, a Chinese troop attacked Zhongxing and encountered the Japanese army. The Japanese army collapsed and retreated, and Zhongxing was recaptured by the Chinese army. Currently, the county seat of Siyang is still under surveillance by the Chinese army.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Ambushed on the Qing-Hu Highway</h3>
<p>Digging Pits to Hide Bombs Achieves Miraculous Results</p>
<p>Qingpu Communication: County Magistrate Yan Fusheng (former Chief of the Seventh District) reported on the 21st that Japanese troops from the Juechuan unit would travel along the Qing-Hu Highway to Qingpu tomorrow morning for reinforcements. Magistrate Gu immediately led the sappers and the Panlong guerrilla team that night, rushing to the Qibao Station on the Qing-Hu Highway and digging a large pit at the base of Bridge No. 16, filling it with hand grenades, and covering it with mud. After the sappers completed their mission, they and the guerrillas ambushed themselves in the Guanyin Temple, waiting for an opportunity to attack. The next day (the 22nd), the Juechuan unit, consisting of more than 300 soldiers, sped westward in trucks. As soon as they passed the Yang Bridge No. 16, there was a loud bang. The first vehicle was completely destroyed, and the second vehicle, unable to stop in time, also fell into the pit. Magistrate Gu immediately led his troops to bombard the Japanese army with hand grenades, killing more than 30 Japanese soldiers. When the Japanese troops from Hongqiao heard the news and rushed to the scene, they only rescued the remaining Japanese soldiers, who fled eastward. It is now heard that the Juechuan unit arrived in Qing via the Suzhou River and Daying Port late on the evening of the 24th.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Begin Attacking Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Repeatedly Annihilating the Japanese Tsuchibashi Unit</p>

<h3>Four Japanese Warships Reconnoiter Chaoshan</h3>
<p>A Small Number of Japanese Troops Land on Shouyu Island, Christians in Shantou Pray for Victory</p>
<p>Shantou Communication: On the 6th of this month, there were four Japanese warships, two anchored between Zhaoan and Zhelin, one anchored in the North and South Ports of Chenghai, and one anchored near Shenquan in Huilai. A part of the Japanese army landed on Nan'ao, and a small number of Japanese troops landed on Shouyu Island in Haimen Bay. The island has fresh water and fishing huts. Japanese motorboats and electric boats shuttle back and forth outside Mayu Estuary, chasing and looting fishing boats. When the Japanese troops landed on Shouyu Island, the local militia resisted from the trenches and reported to the Chaoyang County Government, requesting reinforcements. Shantou City therefore temporarily spread rumors that the Japanese army had landed in Dahao and Haimen, causing widespread panic. Furthermore, several days ago, a traitor from Xiamen, hired by the Japanese side, secretly arrived in Shantou to scout out military information. He was discovered by the Chinese side and more than a dozen people were arrested. They were all traitors from Taiwan and Xiamen. The Japanese coveting Chaoshan is undeniable. A battle in Chaoshan will eventually break out sooner or later. Christians in Shantou, upon receiving a notice from the National Christian Council, fasted for one day on Good Friday, the 7th of this month, to pray for the victory of the war of resistance and the success of national construction. At 8:00 AM, thousands of fasting believers gathered in the Bethel Church, reverently praying for the victory of the war of resistance and the success of national construction. The Fifth District Commissioner's Office recently convened a meeting to promote the "National Spiritual Mobilization," resolving to issue notices to all counties and cities from the Administrative Commissioner's Office, the Defense Army Political Department, the Chaoshan Party Affairs Supervisory District, the Chao-Mei Garrison District Command, and the Director's Office of the 14th Regiment of the Military Affairs Commission's Inspection Group to earnestly implement it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Huzhou Transferred and Ambushed</h3>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Bomb in Retaliation</p>
<p>Huzhou Communication: The Japanese troops stationed in the Xinshi Town and Wudian area of Huzhou were transferred on the morning of the 27th. This was discovered by the Chinese army, who ambushed them on the roadside by the troops of Zhu Xi. When the Japanese troops passed by, they were intercepted in the middle. The Japanese troops resisted desperately in a panic, but after being severely attacked by the Chinese, they collapsed in defeat. More than a dozen Japanese officers and soldiers were killed or wounded, and more than a dozen Chinese soldiers were also injured. After suffering this disastrous defeat, the Japanese troops reported to the Japanese regular bureau in Jiaxing. On the 28th, a team of Japanese aircraft from He sent a team of planes to Xinshi Town and the surrounding area for reconnaissance, and then dropped three or four bombs in the urban area and strafed with machine guns. It is estimated that dozens of civilian houses were bombed and destroyed in the town, and more than a dozen innocent residents were killed and countless were injured. After dropping bombs in Xin, the Japanese aircraft flew to Qianjing (a local name, very close to Xinshi, an important pass near the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway) and dropped a bomb, the damage is unknown.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Jinshan Invade Maoqiao</h3>
<p>Japanese Lieutenant Killed</p>
<p>Jinshan Communication: The Jinshan Japanese Garrison, led by Japanese Lieutenant Nakao, along with puppet police, invaded the position of the Chinese xxx Brigade in Maoqiao the day before yesterday. The brigade resisted firmly. After a fierce battle lasting a day and a night, the Japanese Nakao was killed by the Chinese troops, and the front line fell into chaos. The Chinese troops took advantage of the victory to pursue, and the puppet police were completely annihilated. The remaining Japanese troops fled towards Jinshan, four kilometers south of Maoqiao.</p>
<h3>Stone Quarrying Sites in Western Songjiang All Closed</h3>
<p>Nine Hills Not Allowed to Be Quarried, Thousands of Stonemasons Displaced</p>
<p>The Tianma Mountain, Hengshan, Sheshan, Xiaokunshan, Xueshan, Fenghuang Mountain, Gonggong Mountain, Beigan Mountain, Xiaoshan, and other hills in the western Songjiang area have always been quarried by workers hired by various hill owners, and the stones are transported to Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places as building materials. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the National Army has moved west, and all the stone quarrying hills have become guerrilla areas. Last month, the Japanese troops stationed in Songjiang went to the old site of a certain steel factory on Tianma Mountain to collect a large amount of steel. They hired hundreds of Jiangbei workers to transport it in batches over a period of two weeks. After that, the Japanese and puppet troops dispatched a large number of troops to close and occupy all nine hills, not allowing the hill owners to quarry. The daily lives of thousands of stonemasons depend entirely on quarrying. Now they have been displaced. It is heard that after the Japanese side closed the hills, it has now formed a separate quarrying company to extract stone and distribute the profits.</p>
<h3>Traitors in Wuxi Suppress Opium</h3>
<p>Every Opium Den Must Sell One Ounce Per Day</p>
<p>Wuxi Communication: Since Wuxi was poisoned by the Japanese puppet's policy, opium dens have sprung up everywhere, and there is a puppet anti-opium bureau responsible for promoting opium sales. However, there are too few smokers, resulting in low opium sales. In March, less than 3,000 ounces were sold. The puppet bureau chief, Xuan Baohua, was very anxious and ordered the puppet inspection and license bureau staff that from the 21st, each opium den must sell a minimum of one ounce of opium per day. Those who do not meet the quota will have their puppet licenses revoked. The opium dens, under this pressure, are facing the prospect of automatically closing down due to the normal level of sales.</p>
<h3>German Steamer "Wang Bao" Seized by Japanese Warship</h3>
<p>The Steamer Travels the Ningbo-Dinghai Line, its Whereabouts Unknown After Seizure</p>
<p>Ningbo Communication: After the German Far East Company's Tianbao Steamer, which travels the Ningbo-Dinghai line, was approved to resume sailing, it sailed from Ningbo to Dinghai at 10:00 AM on the 26th, carrying 147 pieces of cargo such as cloth, hemp, and bamboo shoots, and four or fifty passengers. Unexpectedly, at 1:00 PM that afternoon, when it was sailing between Ligang and Luotoumen, it was suddenly intercepted by a Japanese warship and forced to sail away with it. The whereabouts of the steamer are currently unknown. All the passengers on board were detained on the ship. It was found that the German shipowner, Erhard Siebert, had recently taken the Hana Steamer from Dinghai to Shanghai for recuperation. There were no other foreign crew members, so he was unable to immediately negotiate with the Japanese warship when it was seized.</p>
<h3>Xinghua Organizes a Committee to Inspect Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Register by Deadline or Confiscate</p>
<p>Xinghua Communication: The county government believes that recently there have been frequent cases of unscrupulous merchants selling Japanese goods, hoping to profit from them. In order to identify Japanese goods, a committee to inspect Japanese goods was organized at the county government conference at 3:00 PM on the 18th of this month, bringing together the county chamber of commerce, the county party department, the Beijing-Guangzhou goods guild, the cloth guild, the south goods guild, the county police assistant, the technical chief, and the chiefs of various districts. After deliberation, it was decided that all attending agencies and organizations would be members, with County Magistrate Qi as the chairman and County Party Secretary Chen as the vice-chairman. It was also resolved that all merchants must register their existing Japanese goods within a specified period, otherwise they will all be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Sanmen Bay's Market Suddenly Booming</h3>
<p>Merchants and Customers Come to Buy Goods</p>
<p>Ningbo Communication: Since the mouth of the Yong River was ordered to be blockaded, the source of goods has been cut off, and inland prices have gradually risen. Now, sailing ships from Taiwan are coming and going to Shanghai in Sanmen Bay's Haiyou Town, transporting goods. Merchants from all over the country have come to the area to purchase goods. Sanmen Bay's commerce has suddenly boomed.</p>
<h3>Twists and Turns in the Reorganization of the First Regiment of the Jiangsu Security Force</h3>
<p>The First Infantry Regiment of the Third District Security Force of Jiangsu Province is stationed in the Jiading, Taicang, and Baoshan areas. Recently, it received an order from the Shanghai Military Commissioner of the Third War Area to expand into the First Route Command of the Shanghai People's Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Corps, and appointed Deng Jinglie, the regiment commander of the regiment, as the commander, Xu Jihui, the deputy regiment commander of the regiment, as the chief of staff, Tan Siyuan, the battalion commander of the first battalion of the regiment, as the commander of the first detachment, and Zhu Weiren, the battalion commander of the second battalion of the regiment, as the commander of the second detachment. After receiving the order, the regiment was preparing to reorganize, but a few dismissed officers and soldiers fabricated rumors out of resentment, saying that the regiment's reorganization into a self-defense corps meant that it belonged to the puppet-organized county self-defense corps, and secretly distributed leaflets in an attempt to slander it. There are suspicions that they have received bribes from others as counter-espionage propaganda, and it is being thoroughly investigated. Regiment Commander Deng Jinglie and others, feeling unjustly accused, jointly convened a high-level military meeting with Jiading County Magistrate Lu Linxun to discuss reorganization methods. They all agreed that the rumors were unfounded and stemmed from confusion over the name of the self-defense corps. In addition to thoroughly investigating the traitors and punishing them according to the law, they also requested their superiors to preserve the original name of the security regiment.</p>
<h3>Zhu Ji Concurrently Serves as the Magistrate of Jingjiang County</h3>
<p>Local People Rejoice at Getting the Right Person</p>
<p>Jingjiang Communication: Jingjiang is located on the banks of the Yangtze River, facing Jiangyin across the river. Since the Chinese army abandoned Chengxi, Jingjiang also fell into enemy hands. However, the Japanese army only occupied the urban area, and the remaining towns are still under the jurisdiction of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. All administrative matters are carried out as usual in accordance with the orders of the central government. Currently, the Jiangsu provincial authorities, considering that the county is strategically important, have specially appointed Zhu Ji, the commander of the Fourth Brigade of the Provincial Security Force, as the concurrent county magistrate of the county. The original county magistrate, Han Tong, has completed the handover. It is heard that after Zhu Brigade Commander took office, he has spared no effort in appeasing the local people and is strictly enforcing the law against drug traffickers and opium addicts. Zhu is originally from Jingjiang and a graduate of Baoding Military Academy. After August 13th, he organized the People's Self-Defense Force, was brave and good at fighting, and was highly valued by his superiors. This appointment to concurrently administer his hometown's political affairs is celebrated by the local people.</p>

<h3>Japanese Arrest Chinese Patriotic Volunteers</h3>
<p>A Total of Thirteen People Arrested</p>
<p>Japanese Lines Are Densely Deployed, Setting Traps</p>
<p>Since Xiong Jiantong, commander of the guerrilla forces in the six counties of Qin, Jia, Tai, Kun, Qing, and Song, was lured and arrested by the Japanese, his secretary, Zhou Yuwen, and six others, including Luo Zhenqing, have also been arrested in Shanghai. The details of the process have been reported in newspapers. It is now known that the Japanese side publicly announced yesterday that they have recently arrested activists from various Chinese guerrilla forces in Shanghai one after another. The number of Chinese patriotic volunteers arrested is as many as thirteen, and they are all key figures in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Shen Hengyi and Others Arrested One After Another</p>
<p>According to the Japanese side, on the morning of the 26th of last month, Shen Hengyi, a staff officer of the general headquarters of the Zhejiang National Anti-Enemy Self-Defense Corps, and Shen's key members, Kong Qingzeng and Yang Ru, were arrested in western Shanghai. The same methods used on Xiong Jiantong were used on Shen and others. When Shen was arrested, local newspapers in Shanghai published news of the incident, but it was brief and not detailed. At that time, it was impossible to obtain the details.</p>
<p>Xiong's Subordinates Also Detained</p>
<p>Before this case occurred, after Xiong Jiantong was arrested, according to Japanese propaganda, during this period, the Japanese military police were dispatched to find that Xiong's subordinate, Wu Bocheng, had rented the premises at 631 Myburgh Road and opened a shop as a communication point. Wu was arrested by the Japanese side, and then Guo Zhixiang and Zhang Shufan, the Bao Ying natives who were the wireless communication officers of Xiong's unit, were arrested at Room 719 on the seventh floor of the Yangzi Hotel. The dates of the arrest of Wu, Guo, and Zhang were the 13th and 14th of March.</p>
<p>Chongming Detachment Leader Arrested in Shanghai</p>
<p>Until the morning of the 26th of last month, Chen Chaozu (43 years old), a native of Chongming, was arrested at the Bund Garden Pier on a civilian boat in the Huangpu River by Japanese police officers and [name missing] City Officer Ichikawa. According to the Japanese announcement, Chen was the leader of the Chongming Detachment of the Jiang-Zhe Guerrilla Force, and his troops had five machine guns and more than 500 rifles. His strength was very strong, and he had fought many battles with the Japanese army. He was regarded as a confidant's problem. Chen often came to Shanghai to purchase military supplies. The Japanese had long received information from traitors, so they sent Captain Tsuda of the Military Police to be responsible for the investigation. Until that day, the Japanese learned that Chen was carrying military supplies and many of his subordinates, disguised, had boarded a civilian boat on the Bund, intending to return to his base in Chongming. So they rushed to the scene and arrested Chen and his squadron leader Shen Hao, squad leader Wu Bingsun, secretary and liaison officer for the Chongming Anti-Japanese Primary School in Wusong, Lu Cuoning, Xu Yincheng, and recruiting officer Zhu Wenhua, a total of six people.</p>
<p>Claiming to Have Two Bases</p>
<p>The Japanese side also announced that Chen's unit had two bases in Shanghai, one in the Zhonghui Building and one in a certain number of the Xintai Bank Building on Henan Road, Sijing Road. Detailed news about this was published yesterday in a very prominent position in local Japanese newspapers in Shanghai. It seems that these Chinese patriotic figures, who have been formally announced by the Japanese side, are still being held in a certain place in Hongkou, and there is no danger to their lives.</p>

Besides reporting the disaster caused by the Japanese bombing, it also stated that Ling Bridge was destroyed. However, yesterday evening's news reported that Ling Bridge remained intact as usual and was not affected. After much inquiry, it was learned that Ling Bridge was indeed hit by a bomb when Japanese planes dropped bombs, but because the explosive force was not great and the bridge was sturdily built, the road surface suffered only slight damage. Currently, the authorities are making every effort to comfort and assist the affected households and stabilize public morale, so order has already been restored.</p>
<p>Ningbo Chamber of Commerce Telegram Requests Relief</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that Zhou Dalie, Chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, sent a special telegram yesterday to the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai, which reads, "Respectfully, to Elder Yu Qiaqing and gentlemen of the Native Association, forwarded by Brother Mei Xian (Zhu Meixian, Manager of the Ningbo Shaoxing Company). On the day before yesterday, Japanese planes bombed Ningbo, destroying Ling Bridge and burning over a thousand houses. Casualties are heavy, shops are closed, and people have fled. Ningbo has become a dead city. You are concerned about your hometown, and how should we provide relief to the refugees? Please take immediate measures to alleviate the suffering of the survivors. Awaiting your reply. Zhou Dalie, Chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, bows respectfully." After the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai received the above telegram, they immediately replied, "Respectfully to the Chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce. We have received your telegram. We are deeply concerned about the disaster in our hometown. We will immediately convene a meeting to discuss relief measures. We will inform you in advance and look forward to your detailed telegrams at any time. Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai bows respectfully."

<h3>Public Donations Must Not Be Misappropriated</h3>
<p>Otherwise, Strict Punishment Will Be Imposed Upon Discovery</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission believes that public donations are an expression of the people's patriotism and should be used entirely for the war effort. He has specially telegraphed all levels of party headquarters across the country, stating that all donated funds received should be reported and remitted to the national treasury at any time. It is absolutely forbidden to store or misappropriate them for any reason. Otherwise, strict punishment will be imposed upon discovery to maintain party discipline.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Financial Stability: All Industries Safely Pass the Quarter-End</h3>
<p>Money Dealers Association Announces Interbank Rate</p>
<p>Banks and Firms Will Allow Flexibility for Maturing Loans</p>
<p>Today is the quarter-end settlement period for Shanghai's industry and commerce. The Money Dealers Association has announced the interbank interest rate. Banks and firms will allow flexibility in extending the terms of maturing long-term credit loans to the tenth day of the month and will grant new loans to manufacturers and merchants dealing in national goods. The financial market remains stable, and all industries are safe and sound. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Interbank Rate Discussion</p>
<p>The Money Dealers Association convened a quarter-end interbank rate meeting at 2:00 p.m. on the 25th of this month. Managers Xi Jiming, Zhang Mengzhou, Yan Dayou, Shen Jingliang, Pei Yunqing, Xu Wenqing, and others from Fuyuan, Shunkang, Shifeng, Wufeng, Tongrun, Hongsheng, Huifeng, Cunde, and other firms attended. The meeting decided on an interbank rate of 5.5 yuan. The announcement is recorded below: "To whom it may concern, the interbank interest rate for this quarter, as decided at the interbank rate meeting convened on the 25th of this month, is 5.5 yuan. We hereby inform you for your reference."</p>
<p>Quarter-End Arrived</p>
<p>A Xinsheng News Agency reporter learned yesterday from silver and money dealers that fixed-term credit loans in the Shanghai market are mostly limited to six months, called "six pairs," meaning six matching months. For example, every quarter-end and the tenth day of the month are the beginning and end periods, or called "long-term forties," because the peak season for commerce and goods throughout the year is after those two months. If funds are needed for the new goods that appear on the market in May or June, they are made in advance at the end of April. If funds are needed to handle cross-year goods in November or at the end of the year, they must be made in advance at the end of October. This year's quarter-end has arrived.</p>
<p>National Goods Loans</p>
<p>Money dealers have already added to the "interbank" interest rate and made their own decisions based on the availability of funds. This year, credit and long-term loans have been granted as much as possible to factories and firms dealing in national goods. The interest rate is directly negotiated by each firm and each firm to support the development of national goods businesses. However, purchase loans for spring cocoons, new tea, rapeseed, wheat, etc. in the occupied areas are all rejected. Those outside the occupied areas are still granted loans on a discretionary basis.</p>
<p>Maturing Loans</p>
<p>Although the exact amount of credit loans maturing this quarter-end cannot be verified, it is estimated to be 40 to 50 million yuan. Money dealers account for 80 to 90 percent, and banks account for only 10 to 20 percent. Because the business of money dealers is mainly based on credit loans, money dealers are now allowing reliable firms to extend the terms to the end of October, but interest must be paid off. Separate new loan contracts are signed. The above extension procedures are handled separately by each firm and are completed before today.</p>
<p>All Industries Safely Pass</p>
<p>After the war, all firms implemented contraction and increased reserves in accordance with the financial measures set by the Ministry, and benefited from the adjustments of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China, as well as the effects of the remittance and bill system. Therefore, Shanghai's financial market remains stable as usual. Various interest rates have rarely changed. The bankruptcy of banks and money dealers has not occurred at all, which is very different from the quarter-ends of past years. There is no shortage of funds. All industries have developed abnormally after the war and can safely pass this quarter-end, which is better than before the war.</p>
<h3>American Ten-Thousand-Ton Cruiser Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Crew Members Go Ashore to View the War Ruins in Zhabei. The Ship is Scheduled to Leave Shanghai at Noon Tomorrow.</p>
<p>Flagship of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet Also Arrived in Port Yesterday</p>
<p>Dalu Bao reports that the American ten-thousand-ton cruiser Astoria, which carried the ashes of former Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito back to Japan, was scheduled to dock outside Wusong last night (28th) and enter the port around 8:00 a.m. this morning (29th), docking at the fourth and fifth buoys, where Japanese ships often dock. It was originally scheduled to stay in Shanghai for a week and then sail to Hong Kong and Manila, but unconfirmed sources say it will only dock for one day. As of late last night, the captain of the Astoria had not notified local authorities of his plans in Shanghai, so it is not known for sure whether it</p>
<p>will stay in Shanghai for one day or one week. Naval circles in this port believe that the original plan will not change because the crew will not have time to go ashore for a tour in one day, and it is said that the ship will add some items in this port, which will take more than 24 hours. Also, the flagship of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, the Augusta, sailed from Manila and is scheduled to arrive at Wusong before dawn today. It will arrive in port before the Astoria and dock at the naval buoy in front of the Customs Pier, staying in Shanghai for one month and then sailing to North China for patrol. Destroyers and submarines of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet will arrive in Shanghai for temporary docking starting in late May,</p>
<p>and then sail to Qingdao and Yantai for patrol. Also, the English-language "Great American Evening Post" reports that the American cruiser Astoria, by order of President Roosevelt, sailed from Yokohama after carrying the ashes of former Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito back to Japan and arrived in Shanghai just after 8:00 a.m. this morning (29th), docking at the third and fourth buoys in the Huangpu River. It was originally scheduled to stay in Shanghai for five days, but it has now been changed to about forty-eight hours. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai around noon on Monday. The Naval Youth Association has obtained permission from the Japanese military authorities to</p>
<p>arrange for crew members of the ship to visit the Zhabei district, which was destroyed by gunfire. The first group is scheduled to depart at 1:30 p.m. today, and the second group is scheduled to depart at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow. The flagship of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, the Augusta, also arrived in Shanghai around 8:00 a.m. this morning, docking at the buoy opposite the Customs Pier.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Customs Resumes Business: Ramie Fabric Exemption</h3>
<p>Release Upon Presentation of Foreign Exchange Certificate</p>
<p>Regarding the shipment of ramie fabric to Shanghai, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Customs Commissioner of Zhejiang Customs to inquire whether they had been ordered to release the goods. They received a reply yesterday stating, "Your telegram is noted.

<h3>Japanese Merchants Exploit Inland River Shipping: General Strike Imminent</h3>
<p>Boatmen from Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces Take United Action. Lighterage Industry Joins the Resistance Due to Intolerable Exploitation.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese-owned Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company at No. 434 North Suzhou Road monopolized inland river shipping, all cargo transportation routes have been monopolized, causing private boats to be unable to operate and livelihoods to be difficult. Therefore, various groups are opposing this and will jointly launch a general strike to show resistance. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese and Puppet Monopoly of Inland River Transport</p>
<p>The Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company is the general mechanism controlled by the Japanese Qing Shipping Company for inland river transportation. Zheng Wenguang and Li Kunhe serve as "managers" and "business directors." The routes it has opened include Beixinjing (including Hongqiao), Minhang, Yexie, Hupu, Changshu, Huzhou, Xinwuku, Xitang, Fengjing, Songjiang, Wuxi (via Suzhou), and other routes. In addition to passengers, all cargo is transported with a "procurement permit" issued by the Japanese puppets, which is contracted by the company. Private boats without permission are not allowed to undertake cargo transportation. At the same time, they arbitrarily raise freight rates and extort shippers to the extreme. The remuneration for the cargo ships they hire is transferred and exploited by Japanese puppet personnel, and the proceeds are very small. Sometimes they are swallowed up entirely, with nothing left. All boatmen cry out in agony.</p>
<p>Livelihood Difficulties for Private Shipping in Various Regions</p>
<p>Since the affairs of inland river transportation have been controlled by the Japanese puppets, private boats in various regions, which relied on transporting cargo for customers or small-scale trade, have been greatly affected. The impact on rice boats, gravel boats, firewood boats, vegetable boats, manure boats, oil boats, etc., which usually make a living from trade, is very large. Although boatmen have "passes" issued by the Japanese puppet "agencies" stationed in each area, they still cannot load cargo without a "procurement permit." In the past, some private boats, unaware of the situation, undertook passenger and cargo transportation, but after being discovered by the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company, they were reported to the local Japanese army, so boatmen did not dare to solicit cargo and shippers did not dare to entrust transportation. The livelihoods of boatmen are completely cut off, and the situation is very tragic.</p>
<p>Joint Barge Resistance</p>
<p>Private boats in various regions, under the pressure of Japanese puppet coercion, have no way to appeal. To concentrate their forces and express their firm resistance, private boats from Wuxi, Changshu, Songjiang, and other groups first organized a federation and actively promoted it. Boatmen from Zhejiang Province, such as Pinghu, Wuxing, Jiashan, Zhangyan, and Fengjing, have also joined one after another. At the same time, the sand barge boatmen employed by the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company have also suffered deeply from the exploitation of the Japanese puppets and have felt pain. Therefore, they intend to take united action with private boats from various groups and may launch a general strike to show resistance.</p>

<h3>Representatives of Tenants in Qingyu Lane Petitioned the Chinese Directors Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tenants of Qingyu Lane on New Chongqing Road and Chengdu Road in this city are in panic because the Women's Bank has ordered them to move out within a limited time for reconstruction. Yesterday, they sent representatives Qian Huafo and others to petition Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xi Yushu, Jiang Yiping, Guo Shun, and five Chinese directors, requesting assistance.</p>
<h3>Japanese Are Preparing a Cotton Industry Exchange to Manipulate Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>The Site Is the Old Site of the Gold Exchange</p>
<p>The cotton yarn exchange initiated by the Japanese side has been brewing for a long time, but it has not been realized because those engaged in yarn and cloth transactions are afraid of being noticed. However, the Japanese side is still actively preparing, and has already found the old site of the Gold Exchange next to the East Citibank on Jiujiang Road and Sichuan Road as the site. The deposit for brokers is set at 3,000 yuan, and the transaction unit is 10 bales. It is scheduled to start on May 1. The standard brands are internally designated as the Blue Weft brand of the Japanese Chinese Yarn Factory and the Water Moon brand of Neiwai, intending to monopolize the market and manipulate yarn prices. The sign "Shanghai Cotton Industry Exchange Founding Office, Joint Stock Company" is hung in front of the old site of the Gold Exchange, and construction is underway inside.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Is Weak: Using Rubber Men as Soldiers</h3>
<p>Equipping Military Vehicles for Shuttle Patrols</p>
<p>Attempting to Confuse the Sight of the Chinese Army</p>
<p>Recently, the Chinese guerrillas on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways have been unusually active, while the Japanese army has been transferring troops to reinforce the front line due to the tense military situation, resulting in a weak rear defense. The Chinese army took the opportunity to attack and inflicted heavy damage. According to a visitor from Suzhou yesterday, the Japanese army in the inland area has recently been short of troops and unable to recruit more. However, to create a false impression and intimidate the Chinese, they came up with an outlandish idea of preparing hundreds of rubber figures, dressing them in yellow military uniforms, and equipping them with forged firearms. Their heads can also be rotated, and from a distance, they are almost indistinguishable from real people. The rubber figures are all loaded on military vehicles, escorted by four Japanese soldiers. Every evening, they shuttle back and forth between Wuxi, Suzhou, and other stations, staging their old trick of an empty city to show that the Japanese army has sufficient troops, in an attempt to confuse the sight of the Chinese army. At first, the Chinese army also believed it to be true, but now they have exposed it. Therefore, whenever they discover rubber figure vehicles, they attack them. The Japanese side's efforts are futile and ridiculous.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Nantong Suffers Two Defeats</h3>
<p>Women Found Among Reinforcements. Replenishment of Japanese Soldiers Becomes a Problem.</p>
<p>Reliable news from Nantong yesterday stated that before dawn on the 17th of this month, the Chen Caifu unit of the Chinese guerrillas in that area had once again surrounded and attacked the Japanese army. Although the number of Japanese troops stationed in Nantong at that time was large, they were caught off guard, so they were caught unprepared and fought in a hurry, suffering heavy casualties. The number of Japanese officers killed was as high as thirty, which is sufficient to show the intensity of the fierce battle between the two sides in this battle. In addition, the Japanese army's supplies were also severely damaged. Finally, after the rear support was cut off, the Chen unit</p>
<p>drove the Japanese army out of the suburbs. After suffering this blow, the Japanese army felt extremely humiliated and called for help everywhere, eagerly seeking revenge. Finally, on the 20th, they received 200 reinforcements, and before dawn on the 21st, together with the previous remnants, they took seven small motorboats and landed on the Jiang shore around Nantong to make a joint encirclement counterattack. However, the Chen unit had already received the news and had safely withdrawn in advance and dispersed in the suburbs. Therefore, when the Japanese army gradually approached, the Chen unit had already surrounded them again behind the Japanese army. By the time the Japanese army realized it and hurriedly looked back, they were still</p>
<p>trapped by the Chen unit and suffered dozens of casualties. After the Chen unit completed the mission, they disappeared in a certain direction. The Japanese army, unable to vent their anger after these two losses, resorted to their usual trick and conducted a large-scale search in the villages, but found nothing. Therefore, they slaughtered innocent people in the surrounding villages at will, and the number of victims was countless. Corpses were piled up in wheat fields, which was too horrible to look at. However, there was one thing afterwards that</p>
<p>was worthy of attention, that is, women were found among the Japanese reinforcements this time. All their temples had been cut off, and their clothing was the same as soldiers. Many of them had been killed by the Chen unit, and the Japanese army did not have time to remove them, so they were discovered. Therefore, it is sufficient to show that the Japanese army has become a problem for rear support replenishment, and that there are indeed no soldiers to transfer from their country, causing a labor shortage.</p>
<h3>The Standardization Problem of Our Country's Seasoning Powder</h3>
<p>Written by Zhou Dingyi, Manager of Standard Machine-Made Seasoning Powder Factory</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Dingyi, manager of the Standard Machine-Made Seasoning Powder Factory in this city, in view of the general errors of domestic seasoning powder, wrote an article entitled "The Standardization Problem of Seasoning Powder in Our Country," which briefly stated, "Seasoning powder has only been in our country for more than ten years. Before the August 13th Incident, there were about a dozen factories manufacturing it. As of now, the number of factories has doubled compared to before the war, but it still contains a major problem, that is, due to the white-hot competition in sales prices, the quality varies. The largest market for seasoning powder is currently the South Seas Islands. If the quality is poor, it will give overseas Chinese a bad impression. I have studied the food and beverage laws of various countries in the world and have concluded that the most prohibited examples are adulterants, especially the laws of various states in the United States. To talk about the standard of seasoning powder, we must first have a definition of seasoning powder, that is, 'Seasoning powder is a product rich in sodium glutamate, which must contain a small amount of sodium chloride (table salt).' This is a more reasonable definition. According to this, standard seasoning powder must not contain other adulterants except table salt. Therefore, we can have the following standard ingredients: (Grade A Seasoning Powder Standard) Sodium glutamate content must not be less than 85%, and salt content must not be more than 5%. But in fact, due to the general consideration that customers prefer more salty seasoning powder with more stimulating taste, there should be Grade B standards stipulated, (Grade B Seasoning Powder Standard) Sodium glutamate content should not be less than 70%, and salt content should not be more than 20%. If you follow the above-mentioned Grade A and B ingredients, it is impossible to mix other adulterants (because the water of crystallization accounts for one molecular weight of sodium glutamate). A report published in the Osaka Brewing Journal in 1935 analyzed the seasoning powder on the market, and the results showed that the best quality grade A standard, the sodium glutamate content calculated anhydrously, reached 99%. Looking back at our country, it is getting worse and worse. The worst sodium glutamate is only 16% (according to my recent unpublished chemical test results). The adulterant is nearly 60% other than salt. This suicide policy is enough to destroy its existing market. We hope that overseas Chinese will launch their patriotism to buy national goods, but manufacturers bear a very important responsibility for the degradation of quality, and it is urgent to have the fact of ‘standardizing seasoning powder’ to dedicate to the market, then the future of seasoning powder is very fortunate, and the future of national goods is very fortunate. Since the new "Jiuweiyi" and "Xianda Wang" two kinds of seasoning powder came out, Fortunately, I have been praised by all walks of life, and I have not failed the mission of our factory. This is enough to comfort myself and can tell all walks of life."</p>
<h3>After the Tianbao Wheel Was Detained, German Merchants Negotiated with the Japanese</h3>
<p>At the Same Time, Report to the German Consul in Shanghai</p>
<p>After the Ningbo Defense Command approved the resumption of navigation between Ningbo and Dinghai, the Tianbao Wheel of the German firm Schiess de Hoyer, sailed from Yong to Dinghai on the 26th of this month, taking the lead in resuming navigation. In the waters of Luotoumen, it was suddenly detained by a Japanese warship and forced to sail to Shanghai. It is now docked at the Wusongkou, under the supervision of the Japanese army, and forced to fly the Japanese flag. After receiving the report, the firm, in addition to reporting to the German Consul General in Shanghai to negotiate with the Japanese, also sent the head of the firm to the Japanese Naval Command at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to request its speedy release and present evidence to prove that it was German-owned, but to no avail.</p>
<h3>The Forbidden City Photo Exhibition Is Only Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Photography Master Lang Jingshan Visited Twice and Praised Highly</p>
<p>Dr. Ding Hong, a photography master, is enthusiastic about medical relief. He specially selected hundreds of the most exquisite photographs of the Forbidden City he took in Beijing the year before last, enlarged them, and put them on public display on the fourth floor of Da Sun. All ticket sales will be donated. Yesterday was the third day of the exhibition and also a Saturday, and more than 1,000 people visited, an unprecedented scale. The works listed in the exhibition hall are roughly divided into three parts: one is the Beijing part, one is the portrait part, mostly the travel companions in Beijing, and one is the attached more than 30 foreign landscapes. Photography master Lang Jingshan has visited twice and gave extremely high praise to the doctor's works. The exhibition is scheduled to close on May 1, so the exhibition period is only today and tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry to Calibrate Measures This Morning</h3>
<p>The Stagnation Has Been Going on for Too Long and Needs to Be Corrected. It Will Be Held at the Grain Exchange.</p>
<p>The calibration of measures in the rice industry in this city was originally scheduled to be held twice a year in spring and autumn. Since the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai in the past year, the Nanshi and Zhabei have fallen into the war zone, and more old measures have been lost in various firms. In addition, the calibration of measures has been stagnant for too long. To correct the malpractices of the industry, the Soy and Rice Trade Association has notified the Nanbang Guild, the Changshu Rice Industry Guild, and other groups to hold a meeting calibration at 9:00 a.m. today on the second floor of the Aiduoya Bund Grain Exchange.</p>

<h3>Japanese Soldiers Check Epidemic Prevention Certificates at the Garden Bridge</h3>
<p>Stricter with Chinese, No Accidents Occurred</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that yesterday (the 28th), Japanese sentries at the Garden Bridge demanded to see vaccination certificates from Chinese entering Hongkew, but foreigners were not interfered with. Most Chinese crossing the bridge had such certificates. Those who did not were asked to stand aside and wait for a Japanese military doctor to administer the vaccination. Some who did not have certificates and did not want to be vaccinated returned to the south bank of Suzhou Creek. The Japanese sentries and police from the Japanese Consulate General were not very strict in checking certificates. As of late last night, no accidents had been reported as a result of the certificate checks.</p>
<h3>Two British Men and Women Detained by Japanese Troops for Five Hours</h3>
<p>Released after being forced to sign a confession for riding together after curfew</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that Mr. Hayes, a British physical education teacher at a church school, and his girlfriend, Miss Prynne, were detained by the Japanese military authorities for five hours last night (the 28th) after curfew. This morning (the 29th), he recounted the experience to reporters, saying that last night the two were riding horses along the Great West Road railway line when they were stopped by a Japanese sentry. However, at that time, there was a sentry box on one side and a barbed wire fence on the other, making it inconvenient to turn the horses around. Therefore, they continued forward, handed the horses</p>
<p>to a groom, and then returned. They were opposed by the sentry. This morning, a Japanese newspaper claimed that they only returned after being stopped by a British sentry, which is not true. He and Miss Prynne waited in front of the sentry post for three quarters of an hour. Then, a Japanese officer arrived, who was quite amiable, but treated Miss Prynne</p>
<p>somewhat rudely. Then, they were taken to the Japanese military headquarters on Lincoln Road. Another Japanese officer treated them well and offered them biscuits and cigarettes. Finally, a telephone call was made to the Jing'an Temple Road police station, and a car was summoned to take them back, which was already around 1:00 AM. Before leaving, they had to sign a statement stating that their outing after curfew was a mistake.</p>
<h3>Police Inspect Special Constables</h3>
<p>Long-Service Awards Presented Simultaneously</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reports that the Special Constables of the Shanghai Municipal Police assembled and lined up at the Shanghai Volunteer Corps drill hall yesterday (the 28th) shortly after 5:30 PM. They marched around the Shanghai Municipal Council building and were inspected by Commander MacDonald, Acting Commissioner. He took the opportunity to present long-service medals to nine individuals, including Police Sergeant Gaulton, and gave an encouraging speech before dismissing the squad.</p>

<h3>Youths, Posing as Patriotic Organizations, Warn Businesses Selling Inferior Goods</h3>
<p>Threatening with guns, they committed extortion.</p>
<p>The case is serious and requires further investigation and verification.</p>
<p>Yin A'gen, Chen Yonggui, Gao Yong'an, Shan Zhaoxian and other detectives from the Lao Zha Police Station uncovered a scheme at the Grand Hotel and other locations, where individuals, under the guise of the "Young Men's Anti-Treachery Corps" and the "National Salvation Youth Service Society," were extorting money from businesses dealing in Japanese goods such as woolens, dyes, and hardware. They arrested Huang Xin, Liu Fuqiu, Huang Chuanwen, Hua Minxiang, Zhang Ronggao, Zhang Caiyi, Jiang Bofang, Fei Guishun, Jin Huiquan, and a woman named Lu Cuiying, and confiscated a handgun, as well as counterfeit badges and armbands from the aforementioned two organizations.</p>
<p>Crime One</p>
<p>It was discovered that these individuals had extorted money from (1) the Gongtai Woolen Shop on Fuzhou Road, (2) the Chenxinda Dye Shop on Guangdong Road, (3) the Qingshun Cotton Cloth Shop on Ningbo Road, (4) the Renchang Woolen Shop on Tianjin Road, (5) the Huacheng Cotton Cloth Shop on Beijing Road, (6) the Rongtai Woolen Shop on Ningbo Road, and (7) the Caihongji Hardware Shop on Ningbo Road, totaling several thousand yuan. Huang and the others, upon discovering that a business was selling Japanese goods, would go to the business under the pretense of investigating enemy goods and extort money. If the business resisted, they would threaten them with a gun until their demands were met.</p>
<p>Crime Two</p>
<p>These individuals also committed similar crimes six times in the French Concession: (1) the Baida Cotton Weaving Factory at No. 1, Lane 115, Route Conty, was defrauded of 1,000 yuan, (2) the Changji Woolen Shop at No. 15, Lane 389, Avenue de la Gare, was defrauded of 1,300 yuan, (3) the Gonghelai Dye Shop at No. 1, Lane 29, Rue Massenet, was defrauded of 1,200 yuan, (4) the Gongyu Woolen Shop at No. 274, Avenue de la Republique, was defrauded of 140 yuan, (5) the Fuxin Yarn Shop at No. 17, Yuqing Lane, Rue des Soeurs, was defrauded of 500 yuan, and (6) the Hualun Elastic Band Factory at No. _ Lane 19, Ningbo Road, was defrauded of 200 yuan, totaling over 4,000 yuan. There are likely many more cases that have not been discovered.</p>
<p>Stern Punishment Requested</p>
<p>Therefore, the total amount of money and goods defrauded by Huang and the others is estimated to be over ten thousand yuan. The case has been handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Judge Feng Shide convened a criminal court yesterday afternoon to question the defendants. The defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, and Le Junwei to defend them. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi vehemently criticized the defendants for engaging in extortion under the guise of patriotic organizations, which has left a negative impression on the public. He requested the court to impose a severe sentence according to the law, so that those who would follow their example would be deterred.</p>
<p>Defendant's Testimony</p>
<p>During the court's questioning, the defendant Zhang Caiyi and others claimed that when they discovered that a business was selling enemy goods, they would go to investigate. If it was confirmed, they would issue a warning. The money given by the businesses was entirely voluntary as donations for expenses. They never engaged in any acts of intimidation. The purpose of carrying a handgun was because businesses dealing in enemy goods inevitably interacted with enemies, so it was used for self-defense in case of conflict with enemies, and not as a tool for intimidation or extortion. They claimed that they had investigated hundreds of businesses, and if a business did not have any enemy goods, they would refuse to accept money even if offered. Judge Feng, after reviewing the testimony, ruled that the case required further investigation and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Students of Lester School Present Flowers to Late Headmaster Li</h3>
<p>Held at International Funeral Parlor</p>
<p>Mr. Li, the headmaster of Lester School, died on Monday night at 9 PM near Broadway Road and Peng Road when the car he was driving collided with a Japanese commercial bus. His body has been moved to the International Funeral Parlor on Jing'an Temple Road. On Friday afternoon, Mr. Li's friends and hundreds of his students went to present flowers. As the coffin was carried out for burial, hundreds of Lester School students stood silently on both sides, praying for their late headmaster Li. Mr. Li was born in Darama, England in 1901 and studied at the Sandhurai Industrial School. He came to Shanghai in 1933 to establish Lester School and served as its headmaster. He returned to his country two months ago on official business and had just arrived in Shanghai on the 23rd by German ship, but tragically died on the 24th. Both Chinese and foreigners deeply mourn his loss.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Li's Condition Improves</h3>
<p>Protest Letter Concerning Beating and Detention of Assistant Commissioner by Japanese Troops Reportedly Sent Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the "North China Daily News," regarding the incident on Monday evening where Assistant Commissioner Samson of the Police Department was punched in the right ear by a Japanese Marine Corps major in the reception hall of the Country Hospital, it is expected that the Municipal Council will lodge a</p>

<h3>One Murder Suspect Apprehended in Pawnshop Robbery and Murder Case</h3>
<p>Two Accomplices Still at Large</p>
<p>Victim Stabbed More Than Thirty Times, Gruesome Sight</p>
<p>The Fuchang Pawnshop at No. 122, Rue des Soeurs, French Concession, originally located at Gaochang Temple in the South City, relocated here after the outbreak of the war. At 10:45 PM the night before last, three thugs forced open the back door and entered. They first tied up the apprentice Jiang Haoqing who opened the back door, and one thug guarded him while the other two thugs rushed into the counter area. They repeatedly stabbed the shop's accountant, Tang Shenglin (28 years old, from Dongting), in the head,</p>
<p>killing him on the spot.</p>
<p>They then robbed over 100 yuan in cash, a gold ring, and several items of clothing and fled. Afterwards, shop assistant Wang Yuanmao returned to the shop from outside and discovered the situation. He untied Jiang and reported the case to the French Police, who dispatched detectives to investigate and sent Sheng's body to the Tongren Fuyuan sub-hall to await autopsy. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. This publication has learned that French police detectives, based on the statement of the shop apprentice Jiang Haoqing during the investigation, immediately set out to arrest the suspects that night. They</p>
<p>arrested Ye Chunian</p>
<p>(21 years old, from Dongting Mountain), who used to work in the pawnshop business but is now unemployed and homeless. He was taken back to the police station for questioning. He confessed that he went with the two fugitives, Ye Sizhong and Zhou Jie. Detectives also found a cleaver, a small file, and an iron rod inside the shop after the incident. It was also heard that the murderers' clothes were stained with blood during the crime, so they took off their clothes and put on the pawnshop's unredeemed clothes and fled. The detectives took the murder weapons and</p>
<p>bloody clothes to the case.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the police dispatched a Western officer to the autopsy room to take detailed photos and drawings of the wounds on the body for evidence. According to reports from the French Police to Judge Wang Ren of the Second Special District Court yesterday, along with a forensic doctor and clerk, they arrived at the scene to examine the body. The head and both cheeks were repeatedly stabbed nearly twenty times, making it a bloody mess and unbearable to witness. The chest was stabbed more than ten times with the file. Both hands were cut several times while trying to stop the attacks, and one section of the right index finger was cut off. After the examination,</p>
<p>the case was brought before the court.</p>
<p>The detectives first reported the details of the case and presented the murder weapons. The arrested suspect, Ye Chunian, was brought in to await questioning. The deceased's cousin, Tang Zhilin, arrived on behalf of the family and said that the deceased's wife and children were all in the countryside and had been notified by telegram. He requested that the murderers be arrested and brought to justice and asked to claim the body for burial while his family came to Shanghai to arrange the funeral. When questioned, Ye Chunian confessed that he lived with Ye Sizhong, that Ye Sizhong had a seven-year-old grudge with the deceased, and that last night Ye Sizhong called me and Zhou Jie</p>
<p>to go together.</p>
<p>At the time, I was only guarding the apprentice, and Ye Sizhong and Zhou Jie stabbed the deceased to death. The court ruled that Tang Shenglin died from knife wounds and ordered the body to be released to Tang Zhilin for burial. The suspect was handed over to the police department for handling according to law, and the three murder weapons were impounded and returned to the original detective for investigation.</p>

Their love was inseparable, but Ye Shutian had already been betrothed by his mother to a woman from his hometown. Ye opposed the marriage. A few days ago, he suddenly received a letter from his mother saying that she had chosen the 30th of this month for him to marry the woman. Ye received the letter and was struck as if by lightning. He became distraught and unhappy all day. The night before last, Ye Shutian and Xu Meizhen went to Oriental Hotel on Rue Nanking and booked room 207.

<h3>Elder Cousin Repeatedly Harasses Brother's Wife, Then Incites Younger Cousin to Harm Her</h3>
<p>Falsely Accuses Her of Infidelity, Cousins Conspire to Commit Assault</p>
<p>Abduct Her to Remote Wilderness and Sever Her Achilles Tendons</p>
<p>Leaving Her Crippled, Husband Detained for Investigation</p>
<p>Wang Chunrong, 36 years old, from Yancheng, made a living pulling a rickshaw. His wife, Wang Li, 31 years old, worked in a yarn factory and lived in a shed in the western suburbs of Shanghai. They had been married for over ten years and had several children, but only one son remained, who was 13 years old this year. Li provided meager support for the family. Wang's elder cousin, Wang Chunjun, was a tiger-cart driver and coveted his cousin's wife, Li.</p>
<p>He repeatedly harassed her, but she firmly rejected him. Chunjun, unable to achieve his goal, harbored resentment. Last year, he cleverly slandered Li to his younger cousin Chunrong, claiming that Li was unfaithful and having an affair, which he had witnessed, and that the younger brother should punish her. Chunrong believed him and asked Chunjun what method to use for punishment. Chunjun devised a plan. On the 13th day of the first month of the lunar year, Chunrong first scolded his wife Li and then ordered her to write a letter of repentance,</p>
<p>and affix her fingerprint. One night, Chunrong and Chunjun, the two cousins, lured Li to a remote wilderness near their residence, among abandoned graves. Chunrong used a blanket to cover her head, pinned her to the ground, and Chunjun used a knife to commit the crime, severing her right Achilles tendon. After the deed was done, they carried her back home, preventing her from going out and isolating her from the outside world. She has been lying at home ever since, for two months, and her right foot has become crippled. She felt depressed</p>
<p>and had no outlet to express her grievances. Until recently, she managed to sneak out of the house and hired a car to her mother's brother's house at No. 51, Jiji Lane, Dapu Bridge, French Concession, to cry and complain. However, her husband, Wang Chunrong, learned of this, tracked her down to her uncle's house, and tried to take his wife home. The uncle, seeing how cruel Wang was, believed that if she were taken back, he would surely hold a grudge and put her to death. Therefore, he firmly refused to let his niece return. Wang Chunrong, seeing that his uncle firmly refused, argued with him, making a great commotion, unreasonable. The uncle then reported the case to the French Police, who sent detectives to</p>
<p>arrest Wang Chunrong. The case was taken into custody and sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday afternoon. Judge Wu Kechou heard the case, and Chen Ming, a lawyer from the French Concession administrative authorities, requested a postponement of the investigation and then requested an inquiry. The court questioned the defendant Wang Chunrong briefly and ruled that the case be adjourned for further investigation and questioning. The defendant was taken into custody.</p>

<p>Hu Xinglin, from Ningbo, residing at No. 38, Puxian Lane, Kaifeng Road, had a daughter named Yinfeng, 22 years old this year, who was beautiful and liked to have fun.

Li was 23 years old this year and a medicine merchant. After the couple married, they lived together at No. 8, Yuqing Lane, Baliqiao Street and discovered that the bride was already heavily pregnant and her breasts were large, so he was extremely annoyed. Yinfeng knew that the fetus in her womb was not her husband's, so to avoid conflict, she often returned to Ningbo on various pretexts. Later, Li inquired about Yinfeng's whereabouts at her parents' home and also discovered that Yinfeng was not at her mother's home. Yinfeng, because her secrets had been revealed by her husband, knew that it would be difficult for the couple to grow old together. Later, when her husband went out, she absconded with her jewelry and other items. Li deeply understood that their marriage was only in name and was in great emotional pain. Recently, he hired lawyer Gong Chuyin to submit a petition to the Civil Court of the Second Special District, requesting mediation for divorce. The court accepted the petition, and Judge Sun conducted mediation in the Fourth Civil Court yesterday. However, Hu Yinfeng, the opposing party, did not appear despite being legally summoned. The court questioned the petitioner Li Changfa and announced that the mediation was unsuccessful and that a lawsuit could be filed separately.</p>

<h3>Soil Vendor Guo Jinyu Arrested on the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway</h3>
<p>Transporting Opium in Self-Provided Trucks</p>
<p>Suddenly Intercepted, News Disappears</p>
<p>The well-known soil vendor Guo Jinyu originally ran a silk shop in Changshu and had considerable assets. After Changshu fell, he colluded with Japanese and puppet personnel. In addition to continuing his old business, he found the profit from selling opium to be substantial. He and the puppet "Detective Team Leader" Zhu Shunqing opened opium dens in Changshu, Suzhou, and Wuxi, controlling sales and providing it to people to smoke. He also opened a Shanghai-based business on the surface operating in silk fabrics but in reality transporting opium. He used two self-provided trucks to transport large quantities of opium, hidden within the silk fabrics. Because the procedures were secret, it was never uncovered. On the 25th of this month, he was transporting opium worth more than 30,000 yuan from Shanghai to the inland, with Guo personally escorting the truck.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern, a piece of news about our group was published in various newspapers in this city on the 28th of this month, stating that with the arrival of summer and the recurrence of hot weather, there is an urgent need to purchase medicines, and due to limited funds, our group has notified the various trade associations to handle business profit sharing and other matters. This is not true. Our group did send letters to the various trade associations, requesting that they jointly organize business profit sharing, but it was for the purpose of overall and sustained refugee relief, and not just for the meager funds to purchase medicines. We are deeply afraid of causing misunderstandings. Accordingly, we request that you publish this letter in the letter column of your newspaper to clarify the truth and make corrections. Thank you very much. Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Trade Association Fundraising Committee.</p>

<h3>Overview of National Social Education (II)</h3>
<p>(2) Promotion of Libraries (A) "Enriching the National Peiping Library" The Ministry headquarters and the China Education and Culture Foundation Board jointly established the National Peiping Library Committee to oversee all matters and build a new library. Its grand scale and rich collection make it the leading library in the country. (B) "Preparing to Establish the National Central Library" (Before the war, the library in Nanjing also handled the exchange of international publications. The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund allocated 1.5 million yuan, to be disbursed over five years, for construction costs, etc. This has been reported in this newspaper multiple times. Recently, a branch library is being planned in Chongqing.) (C) "Expanding Local Libraries and Local Library Facilities" The number of libraries nationwide has now increased to 4,039. To enrich local library facilities, the Ministry of Education selected readings for middle school students from the Wan You Wen Ku series, compiled a catalog for publication, and issued a notice to all middle schools to purchase them. It also selected children's books and issued a notice to all elementary schools to purchase them. If funding is insufficient, the provincial and county governments should provide subsidies as appropriate. In order to circulate rare and ancient books in China, more than 900 rare or unprinted books were selected from the Siku Quanshu (Complete Library of the Four Treasuries) for photolithographic reproduction. The first batch of more than 300 types reproduced was named "First Collection of Rare Unprinted Books from the Siku Quanshu" and has been published. The second collection is currently being printed.</p>
<p>(3) Promoting Broadcasting Education Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the focus has been on war resistance education materials. Currently, the Central Radio Station continues to broadcast war resistance education and civic knowledge programs on alternate days. All lecture scripts are compiled into a special collection of broadcasting pamphlets. Six types have been published, including "Air Defense," "Poison Gas Defense," "National Resistance," "Wartime Medicine," and "Wartime Japan." Starting from the 28th year, it will work with the Central Propaganda Department and the Central Broadcasting Affairs Management Office to jointly promote the installation of more radios in the rear to strengthen the power of broadcasting education.</p>
<p>(4) Promoting Film Education In addition to purchasing excellent foreign productions, educational films are also produced domestically by the provincial governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces, as well as by some universities, but they are not sufficient to meet the demand. The Ministry of Education will jointly formulate a large-scale joint production plan with the Central Party Headquarters and other relevant agencies to meet the needs.</p>
<p>(Details of the implementation of various items by the Ministry of Education and various provinces and cities have been seen in previous reports.)</p>
<p>(5) Preservation of Documents and Antiquities (Such as the preservation of Tang sculptures and the preparation for the establishment of the National Museum, details omitted).</p>
<p>(6) Promoting Art Education (Such as holding the London Art Exhibition and the Second National Art Exhibition, etc.).</p>
<p>(7) Raising Social Education Funding The provinces and cities whose social education funding reached the prescribed percentage in the 24th and 25th years include Jiangsu, Guizhou, Hubei, Zhejiang, Fujian, Suiyuan, Tianjin, Beijing, and Qingdao. Shaanxi and Ping (Jinxi) are also not far from the prescribed percentage. It is also stipulated that if new sources of education funding are opened up in the future, the percentage of social education at the provincial and municipal level should be at least 30%, and at the county and city level, it should be 30% to 50%.</p>
<p>(8) Training Social Education Talents At present, most universities and colleges of education have added social education or people's education departments. Beijing Normal University has listed people's education as a required subject. Various normal schools have also added social education or people's education disciplines. Jiangsu has established an independent college, Shandong has established a research institute, and Hebei, Henan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang have established long-term training institutions. Most provinces and cities such as Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong, Suiyuan, Chahar, Anhui, Shaanxi, Hubei, Qinghai, and Shanghai have also established special training classes.</p>
<p>(9) Promoting Music Education and Drama Education (Details have been recorded in previous reports)</p>
<p>(10) Compiling and Reviewing Popular Reading Materials In the past two years, 97 types of manuscripts have been compiled and solicited from the Common Knowledge Library, of which 55 types have been reviewed and adopted. For comic books, in addition to reviewing hundreds of types popular on the market, 28 types have been compiled and solicited, of which 13 types have been reviewed and adopted. For popular literature, 13 types, 8 have been reviewed and adopted. Fifty types have been self-compiled for the popular series of books during extraordinary times. After the War of Resistance, high education personnel registered after withdrawing from the war zone, and a portion of personnel were designated to compile 45 types of popular common sense and 4 types of comic books. In total, in the past two years, excluding the review of popular reading materials purchased on the market, 232 types of manuscripts have been self-compiled and solicited, of which 170 types have been reviewed and adopted. All of the above-mentioned adopted manuscripts, except for the popular reading materials during extraordinary times, which have been printed by Chongqing Zhengzhong Book Company, are also being printed. Recently, the Ministry of Education, in order to promote wartime social education, believes that popular reading materials are even more important, and a popular reading material group has been specially set up under the Textbook Compilation Committee to be responsible for the compilation and review work.</p>
<p>(11) Ordering all levels of schools to concurrently handle social education (Details have been published in previous reports)</p>
<p>(12) Ordering all social education institutions to move to the rear. The National Central Library, National Museum, National Peiping Palace Museum, National Drama School, etc. have moved to Chongqing. The National Peiping Library has moved to Kunming and is working as usual.</p>
<p>(13) Relieving social education personnel in the war zone.</p>
<p>(14) Stipulating various social education facilities during wartime (Details have been seen in previous reports)</p>
<p>(15) Establishing Social Education Supervisors Regulations were formulated in mid-May of the 27th year, ordering ten provinces including Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Shaanxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Jiangxi to establish social education supervisors. It is stipulated that each administrative inspectorate district in each province should set up one supervisor, who should regularly patrol the counties and cities in the district, and be responsible for supervising, promoting, assisting, preparing, inspecting, guiding, and training personnel, and strive to promote social education quickly, not just inspecting the original undertakings. In June of the 27th year, the Ministry of Education set up a training class for social education supervisors in various provinces and cities in Hankou. 67 personnel were sent by various provinces and cities to receive training. After graduation, the Ministry of Education has issued orders to various provinces for employment.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Primary School 10th Anniversary</h3>

<p>Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>The Origin of May Day Labor Day</h3>
<p>— Yiming</p>
<p>Children! Tomorrow is Labor Day. Here are some historical materials and facts about Labor Day, the purpose of which is to give you a further understanding of this labor commemoration.</p>
<p>Labor Day originated in the United States. In the past, American workers, like workers in other countries, suffered from the oppression and bullying of capitalists. But the American workers finally woke up. On October 7, 1884, American and Canadian workers first met in Chicago and resolved to strike in alliance every May 1st, starting in 1886, to resist the oppression of capitalists. The slogan put forward at that time was "Work for eight hours, rest for eight hours, educate for eight hours?" The so-called "three-eight system" will not stop until the goal is achieved. Two years later, on May 1st, American workers marched in line, shouting slogans, and staged an unprecedented demonstration. However, it was very common for American workers to work more than ten hours a day. But after that resolute demonstration, not long after, the American capitalists agreed to the workers' demands and implemented the eight-hour workday factory system. After the American workers won this unprecedented victory, they designated May 1st as American Labor Day.</p>
<p>After the American workers won the victory, the result was that the European workers also woke up and understood the pain they were suffering? So they also gathered and marched on May 1st to demonstrate to the capitalists, putting forward the same slogan as the American workers, implementing the "three-eight system," and improving labor treatment. As a result, the capitalists also successively agreed to the workers' demands. In 1889, the International Socialist Party met in Paris, the capital of France, and decided to designate May 1st as International Labor Day.</p>
<p>In this way, Labor Day was quickly introduced from the United States and the United Kingdom to the whole world. And China has had this Labor Day since the early years of the Republic of China. Every year on May 1st, factories routinely have a day off. However, Chinese workers have always been under the oppression of the capitalists and did not wake up. Except for a day off on "May 1st," they did not make any demands. It was not until the success of the Northern Expedition and the unification of the country that the government paid special attention to labor. The general capitalists have also changed their attitude towards workers from their previous appearance. Under the leadership of labor unions, workers in various places sometimes have labor disputes, but there is always no excessive action. Labor and management are mostly able to cooperate, and of course there is no need for strikes and demonstrations. In short, in recent years, the status of Chinese workers has improved a lot, and it is true that the government has paid special attention to workers since the war. This is of course also influenced by Labor Day.</p>
<h3>An Astronomer Who Was Once a Shepherd Boy</h3>
<p>— Jingtian</p>
<p>Children! Don't be surprised, how can a shepherd boy become an astronomer? This is what the ancients said: "Where there is a will, there is a way." As long as there is a firm and unwavering purpose and a spirit of perseverance, then anything can be accomplished. If you don't believe it, please read the story below.</p>
<p>This shepherd boy was the youngest son of a Scottish worker named James Ferguson; he loved to read since he was a child. When his brothers were studying, he often listened carefully by the side, and he also liked to ask questions, so he recognized many characters when he was very young; his father knew that he was a promising talent, and he also wanted to send him to school, but because of economic pressure, he finally gave up this plan, so the unfortunate Ferguson had to be a shepherd boy. This job was very easy, and he had a lot of free time. During this time, he often made various models, such as spinning wheels and windmills, but what he loved most was not these things, but the glittering stars in the sky.</p>
<p>Night came, the fiery red sun hid behind the horizon, and many brilliant stars were arranged on the high and low mountain peaks; Ferguson took a blanket and sat on the dark prairie like a ghost. He held a bow in his hand, and there were nine movable beads on the tightly pulled string. He raised the bow and pointed it at a group of stars in the sky, and moved the beads left and right at the same time to cover up one star, and then he moved another bead to cover up another star. Then he said to himself: "This is the distance between the two stars, which is measured as one inch on the string." Then he drew two points on the paper to represent the distance and position of the two stars; he continued to observe the distance and position of the other stars on his bowstring and beads again and again, so Ferguson made a star chart.</p>
<p>One day, Ferguson's star chart was seen by his master—a farmer—who initially thought it was ridiculous, but his expression immediately became solemn because he already knew the meaning of the chart; after he finished listening to the shepherd boy—James Ferguson—telling his wish, he encouraged Ferguson to copy the chart clearly, enlarge it, and publish it. In a few years, Ferguson became a famous and exquisite astronomer, and he was also elected as a member of the Royal Society of England.</p>
<p>Ferguson, in this harsh environment, finally completed his wish by relying on his own efforts. What's more, you have a good environment. As long as you work hard, then your wishes can all be realized. Children, hurry up and work hard!</p>
<h3>Returning Home Joyfully</h3>
<p>— By Bai Zheng</p>
<p>— Nineteen of the Child's Refugee Diary —</p>
<p>On the fifth day of the Jiangshan boat's journey, Ming’er idly looked out from the bow of the boat, having finished his lunch a while ago. The boatman was vigorously poling, and after poling for some time, he stopped to rest, using smoking to relieve his fatigue.</p>
<p>"How much further have we gone today? Where will we stop for the night?" Ming'er muttered to himself, his eyes still fixed on the scenery, not daring to ask the boatman directly, as he had once been ignored for asking such a question. However, there had been a time when the boatman had answered quickly, so he thought this indirect approach was the most appropriate way to test the boatman's response.</p>
<p>"Today? Only about thirty li. Tonight, we must reach Yanzhou, which is my hometown." To his surprise, the boatman replied cheerfully and readily, probably because he was returning home. Ming'er also thought that returning home was the happiest thing, but unfortunately, Yanzhou was his home. If Yanzhou were his hometown instead, he would jump for joy on the boat today. At this moment, a wave of frustration washed over him. He wondered when they could return to their hometown.</p>
<p>The sun gradually sank in the west, and the boatman stood tall on the bow, one hand shielding his eyes, both to block the glare of the strong sunlight and to peer intently into the distance. After looking for a while, he poled even harder than before, urging his boatmen to speed up, eager to return home sooner and enjoy family happiness.</p>
<p>Flocks of returning crows cawed as they flew, flapping their wings as if encouraging themselves, singing and flying back to their nests. Some were ahead, some were behind, racing to see who would be the first to return to their nest, thereby being the happiest.</p>
<p>The boat gradually approached the boatman's sole destination. Tunxi, although also his destination, was merely a financial goal for him. He opened his blood-basin-like mouth wide, a trace of a smile appearing amidst the wrinkles on his face. He pointed northeast with a rough finger and said to Ming'er, who had the opposite feeling, "Those many houses with smoke rising are my hometown." Ming'er responded casually.</p>
<p>The lights gradually became more visible. By then, the sun had sunk below the horizon. The boat had entered the estuary of Yanzhou, and boats lined the riverbanks in neat rows on both sides. The boatman excitedly greeted and called out to people as if returning home in triumph. When passing a boat that was about the same size as theirs, the boatman said to Ming'er, "That's my elder brother's boat." Standing on the bow of that boat was a person who looked very similar to the boatman, but was slightly shorter, undoubtedly his elder brother.</p>
<p>At this point, the Jiangshan boat seemed to speed up, eventually stopping beside a large boat, which was the boatman's home. Before the boat had fully stopped, the boatman put down his pole and quickly jumped onto that boat.</p>
<p>Curious, Ming'er wanted to see what the boatman's home was like. As soon as the boat stopped, they all crowded into the cabin. The boat was much larger, and the cabin was well-equipped. Ming'er saw the boatman holding a child and leading another who was a bit older, undoubtedly his beloved sons. The boatman's mother, her withered face beaming with a smile, greeted them, bringing tea and chairs, bustling about. The boatman's eldest son even put on a gramophone to entertain them, making the hospitality seem very thoughtful. However, the boatman's wife was unfortunately ill in bed that day, and he did not get to see her beautiful face. The boatman went back to the Jiangshan boat to retrieve two chickens he had brought from Hangzhou, but unfortunately, one had already died. He gave them to his mother, showing his filial piety and his deep care for his family. The boatmen also brought their pipes, lying in the rattan chairs, comfortably smoking, plumes of smoke swirling in the boat canopy. The boatman and his mother spoke in a dialect that Ming'er did not understand, probably discussing the tense situation in Hangzhou since they last met. The gramophone played the tune of "Little Peach Red," which Ming'er usually found annoying, but now, after being away from home for so many days, he found it somewhat nostalgic. The sounds of conversation, music, and smoking filled the entire boat canopy with a festive atmosphere. Unable to bear the smoke, Ming'er dejectedly walked out of the canopy and back to the cold and desolate Jiangshan boat, recalling the joys of his own hometown, and couldn't help but shed a few tears, which trickled into his dry mouth, leaving a bitter aftertaste.</p>
<h3>Becoming a Little Radio Amateur (8)</h3>
<p>— By Xi Ren</p>
<p>4. Installing the Antenna and Ground Wire</p>
<p>Wang Min's cousin first tied the antenna insulator ropes together in a knot, then tied two bamboo poles to the two peaks of the roof. Then, he secured the finished antenna to the bamboo poles. The lead-in wire from the antenna was brought down from the roof and connected directly to the radio in the room. However, it was important to buy new insulation for the lead-in wire, and never buy used goods, because old insulation often has many breaks. If these breaks touched other things, the radio waves from the antenna would be transmitted to other objects.</p>
<p>After watching his cousin set up the antenna on the roof, Wang Min asked, "Brother, is the antenna completely done like this? Is there anything else?"</p>
<p>His cousin listened to him, looked at the completed antenna on the roof, and thought for a moment, then said, "Well, the antenna is almost complete. But come on, Min, let's take a look."</p>
<p>Wang Min and his cousin went to the lead-in wire and carefully examined it again to see if there was anything amiss. After looking around, they felt that everything was in order, and then he said to Wang Min, "Min, okay, the antenna is done. Now, let's start working on the ground wire."</p>
<p>"Isn't the ground wire supposed to be connected to the water pipe?" Wang Min asked.</p>
<p>His cousin replied, "The ground here is mostly cement, so it's not easy to drive in an iron rod. Connecting it to the water pipe is the same. "As his cousin spoke, he separated the insulation he had bought, measured the dimensions, and found that it was just enough to reach from the water pipe to the radio inside the house. As he worked, his cousin said to Wang Min:</p>
<p>"Min, watch carefully, this is how it's done: First, scrape the insulation off the wire until it's clean, exposing the brass copper strands. Scrape about a foot of it, then use a knife to scrape away the dirt on the surface of the water pipe. After cleaning it, wrap the copper strands around it. That's how the ground wire is made."</p>
<p>"Now that the ground wire is done, what do we do?" Wang Min asked, eager to work on the radio now that he heard the antenna and ground wire were finished. Sure enough, his cousin replied, "We can work on the radio now."</p>
<p>Wang Min's heart was filled with joy!</p>

<h3>Games Along the Road</h3>
<p>— By Zixi</p>
<p>Friends! If everyone pays a little attention, you can see children playing "marbles," "water chestnut battles," "jump rope," "roller skating," "tag," "riding bicycles," and various other games along the road. Playing games is supposed to be a good thing and beneficial and is originally a demonstration of children's instincts. But playing games is okay if it is done in a playground, in a gym, in a school, or in an empty space in a home. However, playing games along the road inevitably leads to many dangers. Just look at how crowded the passersby are and how numerous the various vehicles are. One moment of carelessness and danger is immediately created. I have personally seen pedestrians' leather shoes crush children's hands, automobile wheels injure children's legs, and children on roller skates knock down pedestrians on the road. According to my friends, these types of dangerous incidents have already been seen many times. These facts have already been noted by the authorities of the Concession police, who have strictly ordered the patrol officers along the road to prohibit it. Violators are taken to the police station for detention and punishment, or flogged on the spot. But how can the sight of a patrol officer focus on every part of the road? Moreover, the clever children have already left when they see the patrol officer coming, so children's games along the road are still very developed.</p>
<p>Little friends! As I said before, playing games is supposed to be beneficial, but please don't just play games on the road!</p>

<h3>Diligence Has Merit, Play is Useless</h3>
<p>— By Zhou Xing, Sixth Grade Student, Jingyuan Elementary School</p>
<p>We Chinese people are more fond of play than diligence, but in recent years, people have suddenly become aware of the lovableness of diligence and have gradually become diligent in their work, so all kinds of undertakings have developed. There are several kinds of benefits of diligence, which I will briefly describe in the following points: (1) Suppose there are two people, one who loves diligence and one who loves play. They both look at a book at the same time. The diligent person can finish reading it in two or three days and understand the meaning inside. Then they look at the second book and can get a lot more knowledge in the same amount of time. But what about the playful person? I'm afraid they won't finish reading the book in a week! Not to mention the meaning inside, so you can know that diligence is better than play. (2) If there are two workers, A and B, who are both plasterers, one day two families suddenly ask them to build a house. When A is building the house, they always rest, smoke, and waste time, so they have not finished building the house in a year and naturally haven't earned any money. But what about worker B? They are completely the opposite. They build the house all day long, without taking a break, until the day's work is done, and then they do some private affairs. The owner of the house is very happy with them and often praises their diligence in front of relatives and friends and introduces them to friends to build houses, so they have built many houses in half a year and have earned a lot of money.</p>
<p>The harms of play have been clearly pointed out in the two examples above. You can neither gain knowledge nor earn money. In short, play cannot develop a career. As the ancient saying goes, "Proficiency comes from diligence," meaning that no matter what we do, we must be diligent in order to be excellent.</p>
<p>Little friends! Do you like diligence or play? If you are diligent, become more diligent. Those who like to play should quickly correct their mistakes and implement diligence! You must know that play is useless and harmful.</p>
<h3>May Has Arrived</h3>
<p>— By Liu Shengyuan, Fifth Grade Student, Minsheng Elementary School</p>
<p>Turning the calendar day by day, letting time pass in a hurry, I suddenly see that the calendar is showing the words "May". Oh! May, known as the month of national humiliation, has come before us again!</p>
<p>In China, there is almost no month that does not have a day of national humiliation, which is really heartbreaking, especially May. It has the most days of national humiliation, among which, in addition to May 1st, which is International Labor Day, May 4th, which is the Student Movement Commemoration Day, and May 18th, which is the Chen Qimei Martyrdom Commemoration Day, May 3rd is the Jinan Massacre Commemoration Day, May 7th is the day when Japan proposed the Twenty-One Demands, May 9th is the commemoration of Yuan Shikai, who wanted to be emperor, admitting the humiliating conditions, and May 30th is the Shanghai Massacre Commemoration Day. Counting them up, they account for a large proportion of all national humiliations.</p>
<p>Why do we have national humiliations? Although it is because of the power of the great powers, the main reason is that the Chinese people do not know how to invigorate themselves and give up on themselves, allowing the national power to weaken day by day, so foreigners see us as easy to bully and use force to oppress us, so this is really our humiliation.</p>
<p>However, our country has now unveiled the great war of resistance against slavery, and the whole country is united in resisting foreign insults. We must not only clear away the national humiliations but also make the country strong. In this vigorous era, we feel unparalleled glory in everything. No matter which national humiliation comes, we do not feel ashamed or embarrassed at all.</p>
<h3>How to Learn Arithmetic</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Zhenfu, West District Elementary School, Public Works Bureau</p>
<p>Little friends, what is the most headache-inducing course we feel in school? I think you will definitely say "arithmetic"! However, as long as we can study hard, arithmetic is not difficult to learn, and it will even make us feel interested. How to study?</p>
<p>(1) Study more: Arithmetic is like writing compositions; if you don't study it often, you will become rusty, so you must study it more so that it doesn't feel difficult.</p>
<p>(2) Memorize formulas: Formulas are very important in arithmetic and must not be forgotten, otherwise, you will not be able to do the problems.</p>
<p>(3) Consider carefully: When doing application problems, you must first understand the meaning of the problem, and then think about it carefully. If you study with this kind of care, you won't do them wrong.</p>
<h3>Autobiography of a Swing</h3>
<p>— By Qi Jinmei, Fourth Grade Student, Zhendong Elementary School</p>
<p>My name is Swing, and I used to live in the forest. I had many companions. One day, several workers came and cut down me and my companions and sold us to a carpentry shop. The carpenter was really strong. He made me into strips, nailed them together again, and sold me to a teacher at a school. The teachers put me in a playground. I was afraid that the students would break the ropes above me, and I would fall down, and I was also afraid that they would push me over. Later, I waited patiently to see what would happen. After waiting for a while, a child came over, sat on me, and swung back and forth, looking very proud. Suddenly, a group of children came, and the first child jumped down. They scrambled to sit on me. Some of them swung higher than the frame, and if they lost their grip and fell down, their heads would be broken and bleeding. It's all their own fault. If they were good friends with me, they wouldn't have ended up like this.</p>
<h3>Snow White (16)</h3>
<p>— By Tiansun</p>
<p>Snow White's glass coffin had been placed in the forest for several months. She slept soundly in the coffin, her beautiful face still unchanged. Wildflowers smiled, good birds sang, accompanying her loneliness. But before long, the news of the beautiful princess in the glass coffin spread everywhere, and everyone far and wide knew about it. This news finally reached the ears of the young and beautiful prince. He was immediately moved and suspected that the sleeping person in the glass coffin was the long-lost Snow White. He had been thinking about her for a long, long time. He immediately made up his mind to go and take a look, so he jumped on his white horse without hesitation and rushed to where the seven dwarfs lived.</p>
<p>The white horse never stopped, running as fast as chasing the wind and electricity, and soon arrived in that forest. When he saw the glass coffin, his eyes immediately blurred and were filled with tears. When he went closer to look, he saw Snow White's beautiful corpse lying stiffly there, her snow-white face even more beautiful than before. He couldn't help but lower his head and kiss Snow White's cold lips as a final farewell.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, after the prince's sweet kiss, Snow White's stiff body suddenly moved, as if a child was waking up from a deep sleep, slowly opening her closed eyes and immediately seeing the prince, giving a slight smile. It was as if a beautiful rose had bloomed in the spring breeze. The prince was overjoyed and quickly stretched out his two strong arms to lift Snow White from the coffin, truly loving her and unable to let her go. It turned out that this first kiss of love had broken the evil magic of the queen's green apple. The queen harmed herself, sacrificing her own life in vain, while Snow White was resurrected from then on.</p>
<p>The seven dwarfs watched from the side and were overjoyed, spinning around, hugging each other, and laughing uncontrollably. The little birds in the trees were also extremely happy, joining together and singing loudly, almost bursting their little throats. All the rabbits, deer, and other small animals in the forest jumped around, making joyful noises, all celebrating the princess's resurrection.</p>
<p>The prince thought that he couldn't rest easy leaving Snow White here, so he decided to take her back with him. On the day of departure, the princess kissed the seven dwarfs goodbye one by one, and everyone reluctantly parted, feeling very reluctant to part with each other. At that time, the princess promised them that she would definitely come back to visit them every spring when the flowers smiled and the birds sang.</p>
<p>At this point, Snow White's heart was filled with joy, thinking that the hard times were over and her past dreams had finally come true. The prince picked her up from the ground and rode on the white horse together. Their intertwined figures gradually disappeared in the shadow of the setting sun, heading straight back to his cloud palace.</p>
<p>From then on, the two of them lived together in the cloud palace, living a happy life forever. (The End)</p>

<h3>Finance Tianjin Gold Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Local Cash Initially Falls Then Recovers</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cash "shia chih" [unclear term] in the off-market situation showed a fluctuating trend, with prices first falling then rising, ultimately recovering. The initial opening was due to operators basing their actions on Mr. X's frequent remarks that, although war would not break out in the short term, war panic still existed. Therefore, the buying interest was slightly weak. Although the Xiamen gang entrusted a certain gold firm to purchase, the amount was limited. Moreover, the silver shop gang and money exchange businesses (acting for wealthy individuals) supplied a lot of gold. Therefore, the market fell, and by the noon closing, it had retreated to a low of 2,072 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors suddenly spread that the North China Provisional Bank was experiencing turbulence, that the counterfeit currency had fallen sharply, and that gold prices in Tianjin had soared. The Tianjin gang's buying interest was strong, entrusting a certain money exchange business to forcefully absorb about 200 taels. The price then rose back to a high of 2,080 yuan. However, as the wealthy took advantage of the high prices to sell again, it repeatedly fell. As a result, it closed up only 2 yuan from the previous day, with quiet trading of about 500 taels. Silver shop gold ornaments increased by one yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold, etc., remained unchanged.</p>
<p>"Shia Chih" Only Rose 2 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar of eleven taels, the initial opening lacked buyers, resulting in a long period without trading. It was not until 10:25 that a transaction was seen. The first was a purchase by a certain gold firm on behalf of the Xiamen gang, with the silver shop gang buying a total of 100 taels, with the opening price at 2,074 yuan, 1 yuan lower than the closing price the night before yesterday. After opening, the gold firm stopped advancing and observed, so the situation remained slightly weak. Money exchange businesses traded 50 taels with each other, with the price at 73.5 yuan. After that, buyers became increasingly scarce, leading to a historically silent market. After 11:00, the money exchange businesses were seen selling 50 taels to the silver shop gang, with a noon closing price of 72 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors suddenly spread that the North China Provisional Bank was experiencing turbulence, so the initial opening buying sentiment was quite strong. Local and Tianjin customer gangs were increasingly enthusiastic. As a result, prices rose. The first transaction was by a certain money exchange business buying from a colleague for 50 taels, with the price at 74 yuan, followed by the gold firm and colleagues each buying 10 taels for 77 yuan. Then, the gold firm bought 50 taels for 80 yuan. One money exchange firm bought on behalf of [unclear] then fell. The money exchange businesses [unclear] 50 [unclear] for 78 yuan, then [unclear] 50 taels for 1,077. The closing price resulted in [unclear] 2 yuan [unclear]. The cash gold sold by the local brand gold shops was priced at 2,080 yuan, and bought in at 2,070 yuan. The cash standard gold was priced 50 yuan lower than the listed price, but no trading occurred.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Up One Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael has not changed. However, due to the rise in "shia chih", the price was raised by one yuan at 3:05 PM. Da Tong Hang was listed at 211 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang was listed at 209 yuan. The purchase price was 203 yuan. It is said that Da Tong Hang's jewelry gold in May will be relocated by Bei Qing Yun Cheng, from the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yinhua Street, starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>British Gold Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>According to a London telegram on the 28th, British pure gold per ounce remains unchanged at £7 8s 6d. As a result, the People's Bank of China's purchase price of Chinese cash also remained unchanged at 1,212.3 yuan. The listed price of customs gold also remained flat at 2.386 [unclear]. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained unchanged at 1,207.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rediscount Enters 50 Yuan Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bill discount rate sharply decreased. Each thousand yuan had retreated into the 50 yuan range. At one point, it even fell to 49.25 yuan. However, it slightly recovered by noon to 49.5 yuan. In the afternoon, it maintained the original price, finally remaining at 49.5 yuan, continuing to drop by half a yuan from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms Continue to Settle Forward and Spot Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bank's "ba feng" [unclear term] in the foreign exchange market had subsided. Although oil firms, such as Texaco, and other major foreign firms continued to aggressively settle forward and spot British and American currencies, because foreign commercial banks in Britain, the United States, and elsewhere still had a strong willingness to supply, the process remained flat and lacked change. As a result, British and American currencies were neither up nor down. The volume of trading during the morning was still strong. However, the Hong Kong currency situation continued to be slightly loose as money exchange businesses came back to sell.</p>
<p>In the early morning, both near and far London large bars were flat. New York banks remained unchanged. London raw gold also remained unchanged. The exchange rate for British to American, to Shanghai, and to French currencies was flat. American to British and to Shanghai was also flat, and to French was slightly 0.0625. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was 8[unclear].25 for British currency and 16.0625 yuan for American currency, with no difference from the previous night's closing. After opening, although major foreign firms came to settle, because the willingness to supply from external banks was still good, it was not affected. Foreign firms settled spot British currency with British banks HSBC and Mercantile Bank for 8[unclear].25. Then, oil firm Texaco and other foreign firms successively bought spot American currency from a certain bank for 16.0625 yuan. HSBC's listed price remained unchanged, and the announcement of the silver equalization tax also did not fall. It was still 6.0%. After that, major foreign firms again aggressively settled forward British and American currencies, but foreign commercial banks were also willing to supply as much as possible, so the situation remained very mediocre. Foreign firms settled seven or eight months of American currency with American banks for 15.9375 yuan, and also settled six or seven months of British currency with British bank HSBC for 8[unclear].21875. Near noon, trading became clear, and the Hong Kong currency loosened slightly as money exchange businesses came back to sell. They sold spot Hong Kong currency to foreign bank Banque Belge pour l'Etranger for 56 yuan, and then foreign bank Holland provided spot Hong Kong currency to foreign firms for 55.875 yuan. Therefore, the process was slightly loose. By the noon closing, the bank's spot selling price was 8[unclear].25 for British currency, 16.0625 yuan for American currency, and 55.875 yuan for Hong Kong currency. As a result, compared to the previous closing, British and American currencies were neither up nor down, while Hong Kong currency continued to increase by 0.0625. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Currency Has Huge Transaction Volume</h3>
<p>British and American Gold Notes Rise and Fall in Opposite Directions</p>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold and British-American exchange rates remained unchanged. Foreign firms in the local area settled accounts quite frequently, and banks supplied them smoothly. Market prices remained stable as before. There was no market on Saturday afternoon. The "shia chih" [unclear term] opened, and gold firms supplied quite a lot, but money exchange businesses' buying interest was weak, and the market was soft. In the afternoon, customer gangs and securities gangs suddenly came to buy, but the supply was not abundant, and the market became prosperous. As a result, it rose slightly from the previous day. The supply and demand of foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, was not strong. Trading in British and American gold notes was quite active. The demand for British gold notes was more urgent, and market prices continued to rise. The supply of American gold notes was slightly smoother, and prices tended to loosen. The transaction volume of Hong Kong notes was very large, and prices were quite stable. There were very few public association transactions. Changtai sold and Hongchang bought Hong Kong notes for 500 yuan. Qintai sold and Hongchang bought British gold notes for £50. Yesterday's market prices were that British gold notes rose by one point, American gold notes fell by three tenths of one percent, and all other currencies remained unchanged.</p>

The European war atmosphere after Hitler's speech has not dissipated, and the subsequent issues are complex and cannot be resolved in the short term. Market sentiment has therefore become uncertain. The excitement from the day before yesterday has become a thing of the past. Market prices seem to be entering a range-bound phase. After opening yesterday, the market prices were tight due to slight absorption by Northern interests, but then Dentsu, Lien Ho, and retail investors released more sell orders, leading to a weak market. The 38th stock was consistently sold off, and spot goods continued to flow out. The morning ended down about 0.2 yuan. Due to Saturday's market, the afternoon trading was extremely thin and prices stabilized. Lien Ho, Zhen Kang No. 5, and No. 16 stocks were all sold, while De Fu continued to buy. No. 20 and others also showed some interest in buying, but the market price still ended down about 0.1 yuan. The total transaction volume was over 500,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock transaction: 300 shares of Nanshi Huashang Electric Co. shares were traded at a price of 5.45 yuan.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reported that stock market trading, except for Jardine Matheson shares, was not very active, but the market atmosphere was good. Because Hitler's speech did not contain any stimulating words, there were some buyers in the market. Because yarn prices rose again, Jardine Matheson shares were firm and expensive, reaching a new high price of 18.2 yuan. The closing buying price was 18.2 yuan, and the selling price was 18.3 yuan. Shanghai Cotton Mill shares also had good demand, with a price of 110 yuan. Rui Rong shares rebounded to 7.05 yuan, and Yi Song shares also rebounded to 100.5 yuan. Waterworks A shares were priced at 625 yuan, and tram shares were priced at 37.5 yuan (ex-dividend). Both stocks had demand. Rubber shares were sluggish. It is expected that British rubber inventories will decrease by another 750 tons by the end of this weekend.</p>
<p>London British Far East Company Stocks</p>
<p>The market prices listed on the 28th of this month (Friday) only saw an increase of 5 shillings for Chartered Bank shares, with a price of 7 pounds and 15 shillings. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London China Securities: The market prices listed on the 28th of this month (Friday) were stimulated by the European situation, and high-grade bonds rose by 1 pound to 5 shillings. The British-German Continuing Loan and the Rehabilitation Loan bonds each rose by 1 pound, with the former priced at 65 pounds and the latter priced at 52 pounds. Crisp Loan bonds continued to rise by 5 shillings, with a price of 36.5 pounds. The other three types each rose by 0.5 pounds. The Sino-French USD 5% bonds with Indian bonds rose to 63 pounds. British-French Loan bonds rose to 58 pounds. Vickers Aircraft Loan bonds rose to 17 pounds. However, lower-grade railway bonds remained weak.

The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson Timber Company</h3>
<p>Dividends of 2.24 Yuan Declared, Rubber Also Pays Stock Dividends of 0.2 Yuan</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson Timber Company Limited, a British company in this port, resolved at a board meeting yesterday to hold an annual shareholders' meeting on May 12th. The final dividend for the last year (from March 1, 1938, to February 28, 1939) has also been decided to be 2.24 yuan per share.

<p>The Rubber Oak Company Limited, managed by the Hui Tong Foreign Firm in this port, resolved at a board meeting yesterday to hold a shareholders' meeting on May 16th. The dividend for 1938 has also been decided to be 0.2 yuan per share.</p>
<h3>Grains: Dalian Soybeans, Cargo in Transit Higher Than Spot Goods</h3>
<p>Although the Dalian soybean market situation once softened when cargo in transit was sold off, its potential strength was supported by active open and hidden sales. In the past three days, it has not been affected by the decline in oil prices. Although other beans do not meet the standards for oil extraction sales due to non-standardized goods (each unit of Grand Soybeans produces one or two catties less oil), the streets are still continuously selling them, and the market is optimistic due to the timely arrival and rare inventory. Yesterday, four truckloads of Dalian soybeans were traded at a price of 9.2 yuan and 9.21 yuan, and two truckloads of cargo in transit were settled at a price even higher than spot goods. The opening price for spot goods was 9.22 yuan. More than 300 bags of Pinghu soy beans were traded at a price of 10.05 yuan, 400 bags of Triangular Chongming Yellow Soybeans were traded at a price from 9.15 yuan to 8.95 yuan, and 200 bags of Wuhu soybeans were traded at a price of 9.23 yuan.</p>
<p>It has been verified that 1,045 bags of soybeans were imported yesterday from Tianjin, and 2,620 pieces of raw oil were imported from Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Sharp Drop in Counterfeit Currency Triggers Northern Purchases, Spot Yarn Rises Straight Up</h3>
<p>Only Buying Sound Heard in the Market</p>
<p>Double Horse Reaches 434 Yuan</p>
<p>Selling Prices Jump by Ten Yuan, Beware of Reaction</p>
<p>The surge in the yarn market is the most intense seen this year, with new peaks emerging one after another. The reason for this is said to be the daily decline of Japanese and puppet currencies, which has caused all kinds of speculation. Northern merchants have also turned to the Chinese yarn market to search for goods, which has made the technical merchants more eager to buy. A buying sound has filled the market, creating a yarn shortage panic. Everyone is dragging each other in, racing to be first, which has made the price increases more intense, resulting in a straight upward trend. In the afternoon, the buying sound shook outside the market, and selling prices immediately jumped 7 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 434 yuan, a jump of 10 yuan compared to the previous day. However, only buyers were heard, and no sellers were seen. According to public opinion, the price must be watched at 450 yuan, so those going long are still thriving. However, after a sharp increase, a reaction cannot be prevented.</p>
<p>The situation of spot yarn: At the opening of the morning market, due to various rumors, the buying interest was still strong, and the opening price jumped by 6 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 430 yuan, and other medium-quality goods also advanced along with it. Then, as those who profited sold off, it fell back by 1 or 2 yuan. Until the close, it was still calm. Unexpectedly, the market changed greatly after the opening in the afternoon. Because the demand from the inland was strong, the market suddenly tightened, and there were few sellers. The market price jumped step by step, and the buyers did not ask why, only caring about taking delivery. This situation is too violent. Until the close, Bian Ma was traded at 434 yuan, and the rack price was 425 yuan. It has been verified that the total purchases of various merchants throughout the day totaled 3,485 bales. The transaction volume in the afternoon of the previous day was 570 bales. The total of the two days was 4,060 bales. The prices of 20-count Double Horse and Angel brands both rose by 10 yuan compared to the previous day. Other coarse and fine yarns also rose by 5 yuan to 7 yuan. The factory opened 100 bales of 18-count Lion brand yarn from Litai Factory at a price of 375 yuan, and 500 bales of 20-count Lion brand yarn at a price of 405 yuan. Xinnuo Factory opened 100 bales of 20-count Five Sons brand yarn at a price of 410 yuan, from June to September. Chongxin Factory opened 500 bales of 10-count Dafa brand yarn at a price of 335 yuan, in May. Tongyi Factory opened 300 bales of 10-count Golden Rooster brand yarn at a price of 332 yuan. Litai Factory also opened 200 bales of 20-count Lion brand yarn at a price of 400 bales. Rongfeng Factory opened 300 bales of 20-count Golden Bridge flower velvet gray yarn at a price of 475 yuan. Tomorrow's export yarn includes 445 pieces to Shantou, 700 pieces to Hong Kong, 380 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 95 pieces to Beihai. The amount of purchases from each merchant is listed as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market continues to rise wildly, and continues to soar. Because Northern customers do not ask about anything and collect wildly, it is said that hoarders are collecting because the counterfeit currency has fallen in price, and the Northern merchants are buying goods. However, this situation is also too violent. The price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn has risen to 400 yuan outside the customs.</p>
<h3>Cotton Lacks Great Vitality</h3>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: New York cotton prices slightly fell by 3 to 5 points due to Hitler's speech. Afterwards, the market became chaotic, with near-term prices rising and far-term prices falling. At the close, banks and overseas cotton merchants were buying. As a result, near-term prices rose by 8 to 9 points, and far-term prices rose by 4 to 5 points. Yesterday, Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by 1 rupee, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 10 points. Converted to legal currency, American cotton and Brazilian cotton each rose by 0.9 yuan per dan, Indian cotton rose by 0.3 yuan, and Egyptian cotton rose by 1.2 yuan.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading Market: In recent days, the sharp drop in counterfeit currency has triggered sales of yarn in North China. In addition, the recovery of Nanchang has greatly improved morale. Yarn prices have approached 450 yuan. It is expected that yarn prices may still rise. Each yarn factory also plans to take advantage of this price surge to open a batch of forward cotton yarn. At that time, each factory will replenish a large amount of raw cotton. However, given the current tense European political situation, the factories are temporarily watching and waiting for the development of all parties. The prices of yesterday's cotton market converted to factory delivery prices are listed below:</p>
<p>The local cotton business has slightly improved, but all purchases are from within the industry. The factories still have not taken any action, so the market situation is still lifeless. Xinyu Factory only imported 60 pieces of American cotton, and other manufacturers have no desire to purchase. The future of the cotton market is still faltering. However, the supply is very sluggish. Although the Subei route has not been completely cut off, the goods arriving are very few, only 370 bales. The current situation of spot cotton is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Chekiang Silk</h3>
<p>Exports are Very Active, Factory's French Sales are Expanding</p>
<p>Foreign silk markets: Yesterday, Yokohama was closed due to the Emperor's Birthday. There were no fluctuations in New York and Lyon spot markets. New York Exchange near-term prices rose by 0.5 points, and far-term prices rose by 0.2 points. The silk market has reached a firm and stable state, and silk prices are expected to rise. The Shanghai silk market was very active yesterday, but only limited to Chekiang silk. The white factory's sales to the United States, reportedly offered at 1,750 yuan for 7-8 grade electricity, were still not accepted by foreign firms. Yihua and other firms imported six lots of Chekiang silk and nearly 120 dans of high-grade Chekiang silk, and market prices rose by 30 yuan compared to early April. White factory's French sales had been suspended for a long time. The B-grade grade offered at 1,700 yuan a few days ago has now received a response, with 90 dans traded. After this, French sales may become more lively. Recently, users of the silk market have been very tired. The white factory's B-grade ordinary brand was sold at 1,680 yuan, but the transactions were very sporadic.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 40 pieces of silk and 1,400 pieces of tea were imported, all from Hong Kong. In addition, 1,500 boxes of tea will be shipped to Europe today.</p>
<h3>New Green Tea Mountain Prices are High</h3>
<p>Longjing Qiqiang Selling Prices Have Fallen</p>
<p>At the time when new tea is entering the market, Zhe Dong suddenly became tense. The ports of Ningbo and Wenzhou were repeatedly bombed, resulting in the blockade of the seaports and the interruption of transportation. Each tea factory in this city had previously sent personnel to Ningbo, Shaoxing, Wenzhou, and Huzhou in Zhejiang Province to prepare to purchase new green tea for shipping to Shanghai for production and sales. It is now known that the asking price for new tea in Shangyu, Ningbo, has reached over 110 yuan, a record high. Green tea in Wenzhou is also around 50 yuan. It is said that they are still holding on and waiting and seeing. As for Huzhou, purchasing is difficult. Observing the operation of foreign tea companies in this city this year, it is quite difficult to start. As for the new Longjing and Qiqiang teas for domestic sales in the tea shops, the prices have recently been reduced by 20 to 30 yuan. New Longjing has fallen from 140 to 150 yuan to 110 to 120 yuan, and Qiqiang has fallen from 100 yuan to 70 to 80 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Production Prices are Relaxing</h3>
<p>According to foreign news reports yesterday, sugar market prices for production have slightly relaxed. Although the Shanghai market is still rising, there is a sign of stabilization. The association's board set the price of 24 coarse white transit goods at 19.55 yuan, then slightly relaxed to 19.5 yuan. Spot goods in this warehouse were 27.8 yuan, with a total transaction of 300 to 400 bags. Taikoo carload white throwing prices tightened again, with July Hong Kong currency at 10.75, but has not yet dared to telegraph. Spot goods from the Western warehouse B mark were 27.05 yuan, then 27 yuan. Dutch red transit goods were 12.1 yuan, 200 bags, 12 yuan, 100 bags. National sugar opened 70 bags of Jiatai red at 15.7 yuan, 50 pieces of Zhuangpian green at 10.4 yuan, and 150 bags of Diaoqing at 13.8 yuan, all up 1 to 2 yuan. 2,270 pieces of sugar arrived from Shantou on the 29th.</p>
<h3>Paper: Tin Foil Market Prices are Leveling</h3>
<p>Tin foil selling prices once rose when transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang was blocked. However, Shanghai's inventory is sufficient, and many merchants and hoarders took advantage of the high prices to sell. And since the Qingming Festival, digestion has been weak. The peak sales season must wait between summer and autumn. Therefore, market prices have gradually returned to level. At present, the selling price of high-grade 98 military products is 7 yuan per bar, and the highest price per piece of Lianer is 1.54 yuan.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Huang Zhizi Shortage Rises</h3>
<p>Huang Zhizi shipments from Quanzhou have been cut off for nearly two months, causing merchants to feel a deep shortage. Recently, there has been demand from the Northern merchants. Recently, a certain company brought 30 pieces of Erhong Zhizi from Shantou. The passage has been opened, and its price has risen by 7 to 8 yuan compared to the previous market. It is heard that the next batch of goods will arrive soon, and the market is firm.</p>

<h3>Piece Goods: Insiders and Outsiders Raise Prices to Buy, Cotton Cloth Price Increases are Truly Fearful</h3>
<p>National Cloth White Goods Surge by Five Jiao</p>
<p>No One Sells Dongpi Spot Goods</p>
<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market continued to rise crazily. Speculative thoughts were enthusiastic. Insiders and outsiders from the same industry and the financial community repeatedly raised prices to buy. White goods, coarse cloth, coarse twill, fine cloth, and fine twill were the most popular, with prices rising from 0.1 to 0.5 yuan. In the morning market, a small number of peers sold their profits, with 300 pieces of coarse cloth and more than 200 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill being traded. In the afternoon, sellers gradually disappeared, and the market was chaotic, with quoted prices differing by as much as 0.5 yuan per piece. Colored cloth and bleached cloth were sluggish in sales, with thick inventories. The work of dyeing factories was extremely idle. At this time, it is difficult to cover the cost of purchasing gray cloth, bleaching, and dyeing before selling. The Guangzhou Bay purchases of bleached and dyed cloth are more prosperous, with a total of 4,000 pieces of bleached cloth, poplin, colored cloth, and colored twill being handled. The Tianjin merchants handled 5,000 pieces of poplin and striped bleached cloth. Most of the purchases from this street and the Sichuan and Yunnan merchants were pre-orders. Hoarders also purchased and hoarded 400 to 500 boxes of blue cloth and colored twill. Most manufacturers believe that the selling prices at this time are too harsh, and they would rather go to the warehouse and wait for a price to sell. Therefore, the inventory in each warehouse has been full for several days, and new accounts are difficult to find storage space.</p>
<p>East Cloth</p>
<p>The white goods market is rising, endlessly. Yesterday, due to rumors of soaring Japanese yarn, the financial community was eager to purchase and hoard. They handled 4,000 to 5,000 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill for next month (because no one is selling spot goods this month). The industry was shocked and lost color. The selling price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was jumping 0.7 yuan. Peers were caught off guard and did not know why. More than 4,000 pieces were opened to each foreign firm, of which only one-tenth were fine twill. The opening price is as follows:</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>One day, there will be 190 pieces of piece goods transported to Shantou, 230 pieces to Hong Kong, 100 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 9 pieces to Beihai, and 140 pieces to Haiphong.</p>
<h3>Food: Flour Factory Prices</h3>
<p>Surge by 0.1 Yuan</p>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the spot flour market in this factory suddenly surged. The factory prices of No. 2 flour immediately shouted high at the opening of the market. This is because the sales to merchants in recent days have been consistently active, and each factory has already indicated a price increase, and the international situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. The speech by the German leader is closely related to the future of grain prices. Therefore, domestic and foreign production prices have risen in recent days, raw material prices have risen daily, and the current spot foreign flour on the market is also rare. Factory flour has no competitive pressure for the time being. Therefore, factory prices were firm. In the morning, it passed the price of 4.5 yuan, but the factory was still unwilling to sell. Only the merchants in this street and scattered customers moved slightly. Later, the market price rose to 4.55 yuan before there was a slight supply. It is heard that there are still wholesale transactions from the Beiyang merchants that have not been finalized. Generally, it will be announced at the beginning of next week.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour: Foreign spot prices have also been reported to have risen again. It is difficult to agree on the price of fixed-term orders. The source of spot flour on the market is becoming increasingly tight. Although there is inventory, everyone is reluctant to easily sell it. In addition, under the sharp rise in factory prices, the sellers' asking prices have also increased by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan, but buyers are not enthusiastically interested. In addition to scattered transactions on this street, the continuation of a ban on wholesale transactions.</p>
<h3>Gengxian Hoarders</h3>
<p>Intensify Trading Again</p>
<p>Market Prices Rise Sharply by 0.2 to 0.3 Yuan</p>
<p>The sources of Dujing to various merchants, Heshang to Nangang Nos. 3 and 4, and Car Wheel Buns, were only 1,600 to 1,700 bags from Su Tong merchants. Since the arrival of goods was hindered, the Shanghai market became expensive, and merchants and hoarders all pulled in each other. The sellers took the opportunity to raise prices. For a time, the situation was chaotic. As a result, the price of thick and thin Geng rose by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, and all the bun goods were around 14 yuan, while Heshang was also at 13.7 to 13.8 yuan. Judging from this situation, if there are fewer goods arriving, then the market will be difficult to contain. The price of Duyangbu Jian has also increased by 0.1 yuan, and Bian Yuan has also increased by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan along with the Geng market.</p>
<p>Since the Yong merchant’s handling of Cunwei Ke failed to deliver the installation of the Ke Xian, the market originally had a tendency to flatten. And the sources of Jianglun have been continuous, and the inventory has gradually increased. Therefore, the handling of the hoarding is not greedy. However, the merchants in this street have recently been unable to use Jian to handle the situation because of the small and expensive arrival of Yangdujians in the inland, and the price of Yangjian has risen to nearly 15 yuan. All merchants in this street, shops, and factories have risen to replace the guest sin, yesterday the shops, factories, and factories on the street have paid very much. A number of deals have been added to more than 4000. China Pass machine and the digestion of the rice are very good, and the market has continued to rise one or two corners. The price of Xihong commodity market is about $17.30.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Qingdao Raw Peanuts Export</h3>
<p>Still Restricted</p>
<p>Qingdao News: Export of raw peanuts there is still restricted, so there is a lack of transport to Shanghai. The production price is higher than in the first ten days of this month, and the price of a few dollars is sold in the southwest of 15 yuan and the price of fifteen yuan or two cents. Dongxiyang Village and the oil workshop have over 10,500 packets of a large packet of 15 yuan and 4 cents. Over 2,000 peanut sweets were handled, Wang Taishing eleven yuan to eleven yuan and two cents, Gao Misheng twelve yuan, and over 2,000 bags were traded.</p>
<h3>Honey Dates Source Cut Off Inventory Gradually Depleted</h3>
<p>The inventory of honey dates in the market is gradually exhausted, such as bare and bald, have all been exhausted. Zhazawen Mouheng has a few hundred casks of super eggs, and his price has soared to 140 yuan or 50 yuan, and since the two routes have been closed by both Yong and Ou, there is no way to transport it to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Tinplate Sales are Booming</h3>
<p>In yesterday's hardware transactions, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and other merchants all had some embellishments, but not many. The egg factories and lard factories in this port had relatively smooth business, with the sales of tinplate being particularly prosperous, such as 90-pound double-linked American goods selling for 73 yuan (with guts) and 70 yuan (without), 100-pound double-linked American goods selling for 88 yuan (with guts) and 86 yuan (without), 90-pound double-linked Italian goods selling for 67 yuan, 100-pound double-linked Italian goods selling for 77 yuan, 90-pound single-linked British goods selling for 34 yuan, and 100-pound single-linked British goods selling for 36 yuan. It has been verified that a total of 300 to 400 boxes have been opened.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Wonders of the World's Fair</h3>
<p>— Te Ye</p>
<p>The New York World's Fair is scheduled to open today. A general overview of the fair was already published in this column on the 19th of this month, sourced from Reuters. The Christian Science Monitor of the United States published an article about the fair, with descriptions different from what was previously published. Our newspaper also managed to obtain an aerial view of the entire fair, so we are translating and excerpting that article, attaching it after the image. Readers can use the image as a guide, almost like experiencing the fair without actually being there. If this can spark readers' interest and inspire them to visit in person, the benefits will certainly be significant.</p>
<p>The New York World's Fair, opening on April 30, 1939, can be described as bizarre and all-encompassing. On the surface, there are various novel entertainments suitable for both refined and popular tastes. More profoundly, there are ingenious creations that only the wise can fully understand. In countless forms, everything is captivating. Cultural, scientific, industrial, and artistic items occupy the most important part. Even more valuable is the Fair's underlying theme: "The wonders of today are always less than the wonders of tomorrow." Everything that science, inventions, and dreams can glimpse of the "world of tomorrow" is fully displayed in this fair. Therefore, in addition to providing entertainment for visitors, it also gives them an inspiration to "imagine tomorrow today."</p>
<p>The site of the Fair was once a pile of dirt and debris. It took 30 million pounds to complete. The entire site covers 1,216 acres, and walking around it would take eight hours. There are eight entrances to the fairground. No matter which entrance visitors use, they will eventually reach the "Theme Center," which features the two most unique structures of the entire fair: a giant sphere and a tall spire (see the center of the image). From this central point, fourteen important sections radiate out, each representing a key aspect of modern life. The layouts are all different, so visitors will have a different feeling in each area and will never mistake one area for another. All aspects of modern civilization are included in these fourteen sections. Their names are: Government Section, Production Section, Transportation Section, Communication Section, Distribution Section, Business Systems Section, Housing, Clothing, and Cosmetics Section, Nutrition Section, Health Section, Public Welfare Section, Education Section, Fitness Section, Fine Arts Section, and Religion Section. The entire venue can also be divided into three major areas: (1) exhibits from fair authorities and private industries; (2) exhibits from foreign participants and the United States; (3) the amusement area, similar to Asakusa Lake.</p>
<p>The sphere is a hollow sphere with a diameter of 200 feet, equipped with two escalators that can carry 8,000 people up and down per hour. It is an extremely beautiful location, as it provides a panoramic view of the surrounding scenery. Visitors first arrive at the base of the tall spire, then enter an elevator, and enter the interior of the sphere through an opening 50 feet above the ground. The sphere itself weighs 9.3 million pounds and is supported by eight columns, each weighing nine tons. The columns are all made of mirrored surfaces, with eight fountains constantly shooting water onto the mirrors, making the sphere appear to float in space. It is even more spectacular at night, when powerful electric lights shine through the clouds, making the sphere seem to slowly rotate on its axis.</p>
<p>Inside the sphere, each month moves one foot per second, completing a circuit of the inner circle in five and a half minutes. During that time, visitors can enjoy the beautiful scenery all around, which is called "Democracity" and represents the "garden city of tomorrow." At the same time, soft poetic sounds enter the ears. The poem was specially written for the fair by the famous poet Steele. Looking up, one can also see a majestic team marching and singing the fair's song.</p>
<p>The sphere and the spire are connected by a bridge. Below the sphere is a shimmering turquoise pool. Crossing the bridge leads to a wide spiral walkway that encircles the pool. On this walkway, one can see the entire fairground. The spire is triangular, made of steel, with each side of the base being 68 feet wide. It gradually narrows upwards, reaching a height of 700 feet above the ground. The spire is used for radio broadcasting.</p>
<p>Second in importance to the "Theme Center" is the "Avenue of Patriots," which is the central location of the exhibition area and the center of the entire fair. It is located about a mile northeast of the sphere and spire, extending directly to a large lake. The lake connects the exhibition area, the government area, and the foreign area. There are small waterfalls, small ponds, and fountains, with walking areas on the sides planted with over a thousand large trees, specially moved from other places. The area is dotted with many sculptures and statues. The "Four Freedoms" by the famous sculptor Friedlander, representing freedom of publication, religion, assembly, and speech, are also among them. There is also a sundial, 50 feet long, named "The Nature of Time," which is the work of Manship. Most awe-inspiring is the 60-foot-tall statue of Washington, who took office as the first President of the United States in New York 150 years ago. This fair is held in commemoration of that event. Each side of the "Avenue of Patriots" has giant buildings, with walls 40 to 50 feet high, covered with paintings and decorated with inlaid mosaics, depicting the progress of humanity from primitive times to the present day.</p>
<p>From the "Theme Center," several main roads radiate outward like a fan. There is also a transverse main road that connects the major radial roads in a broad arc. This main road is named "Rainbow Avenue" because the colors and lighting in this area are specially arranged, hence the name. In the guidebook, the buildings to the right of the "Theme Center" are shown in blue, gradually turning purple as they approach the "Avenue of Patriots." Upon reaching the Avenue, the color turns red, and then moves to the left, gradually turning orange, and finally turning yellow at the far left. "Rainbow Avenue" also changes color in the same way. At night, electric lights of the same colors as the buildings shine on the entire road, creating a colorful and beautiful spectacle. "Rainbow Avenue" truly resembles a long rainbow.</p>
<p>At the other end of the "Avenue of Patriots" is a large lake with a circumference of 800 feet. At night, water, fire, sound, and color are used to create a beautiful scene, which can be called a spectacle. It features a thousand water jets, shooting water up to 150 feet high. Every six water jets are clustered together, forming a water column. One of the jet rings, with a diameter of 90 feet, shoots water in various patterns, one of which resembles a golden sheaf of wheat, 90 feet high. In addition to the water jets shooting in various patterns, there are odorless gas pipes that emit flames of various colors, as well as flames emitting various exquisite shapes. Music is also incorporated; four large sound chambers amplify the music, truly creating a harmonious blend of water and fire, sound and color, showcasing the skills of technique and the pleasure of sight and hearing. It is estimated that the area around this lake can accommodate 500,000 spectators. Many people can enjoy this spectacle from the good seats in the surrounding restaurants and the thousands of resting chairs on both sides of the Avenue.</p>
<p>There is also a spectacle on "Fountain Lake," where a dozen or so pleasure boats slowly cruise, illuminated by searchlights like a white sheet. In addition, various specially made large electric lights are added. When the fireworks boats are active, the entire lake is filled with fireworks, creating a rare and magnificent view.</p>
<p>The fuel used for these two entertainment venues is jointly supplied by two companies. Burners with a diameter of up to eight inches are used, with additional attachments, to mechanically feed chemically treated wood layers and other colored miscellaneous materials into the device, creating flames of various colors. The colored flames, 150 feet high, shot out on "Fountain Lake" are produced using 24-foot Bunsen gas burners.</p>
<p>"The City of Tomorrow" is a major feature of the "Home Building Center," which covers an area of ten acres. About twenty fully equipped family homes are built there. This is to give home architects advanced ideas about the structure of residential houses, the matching of various materials, and interior decoration and furnishings.</p>
<p>The architecture in the foreign area combines the ancient and the modern. Ancient styles date back thousands of years, while new styles can be considered "ultra-modern." The Egyptian pavilion is a temple from the time of the ancient Pharaohs. The French pavilion is a modern circular building. The British pavilion is a majestic giant building. The Romanian pavilion is modeled after the extravagant scale of ancient Byzantine architecture. The Italian pavilion adopts a fusion of ancient Roman and modern styles. The Norwegian pavilion is a replica of a 17th-century imperial residence. The Japanese pavilion is a typical example of Eastern architecture. The Polish pavilion is a medieval fortress and a black glass building. Each of the other countries has its own unique features. The food in the foreign area is geographically categorized, allowing tourists to sample food from all over the world in one day. For example, have breakfast in Brazil, lunch in Czechoslovakia (note: when the author drafted this text, Czechoslovakia had not yet been annexed), afternoon tea in England, dinner in the Dutch East Indies, and a late-night snack in France.</p>
<p>The art gallery displays only the finest masterpieces, mostly limited to the works of ancient master painters and the essence of European and American paintings from the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. The music hall can seat 2,500 people and can be considered the successor to international music gatherings.</p>
<p>The entertainment area covers 280 acres, extending in a large arc beyond the main arena and along Fountain Lake, offering a combination of novel and interesting attractions. Near the southern end of this area is a 250-foot-high parachute tower, equipped with eleven ornately decorated parachutes. Visitors first climb to the top of the tower, then sit under a parachute. Once the mechanism is activated, they float down, as if descending from an airplane, but without any danger. Other attractions include the "Enchanted Forest," magical electric lights, and mechanically animated artificial animals, with strange and unusual performances. Visitors to this area are happy and forget their fatigue. The various entertainments are divided into categories. For example, foreign villages, Cuba, and France are in the same section. "Little Old New York" is a section on its own. Horse riding and amazing games are combined into one section.</p>
<p>A playground has also been opened in "Children's World," staffed by dedicated personnel. Boys and girls can play, rest, and dine at will in "Children's World." There are various sports and amusements that are both entertaining and educational. Children aged four and older can all find entertainment suitable for their age.</p>
<p>The entrance to "Marine Transportation Hall" has façades on each side that are shaped like the bows of two large ocean liners. A semicircular side hall partially surrounds a pool, in which fully equipped pleasure boats and speedboats are moored. Along one wall, two levels of decks are created, spanning the small pool. On the mast, 150 feet high, which separates into spars, are hung colorful flags.</p>
<p>"Aviation Hall" displays models of large airplanes that cross the Atlantic Ocean. There is also a large airplane suspended in the sky, with its engines constantly rotating, making it appear to be flying. In front of the entrance of the hall is an open space of 26,000 square feet, in which several new types of airplanes are parked, including the latest flying clipper.</p>
<p>Between "Marine Transportation Hall" and "Aviation Hall" is "Motor Transportation Hall." One of the highlights of the exhibits is "Rocketport," which represents "Travel in the World of Tomorrow," allowing visitors to imagine the scene of rocket flight. The rocket ship is lifted by the magnet of a large crane and placed in the opening of the rocket cannon. After a moment of silence, a dazzling flash of light and a silent explosion occur, and then the rocket ship flies into the ether, which is represented by a large celestial canopy full of stars.</p>
<p>Education is "a great force standing between civilization and incineration," so it occupies an important place in the World's Fair, as if it were a Ministry of Education. Dr. Chase, President of New York University, serves as Chairman and directs everything.</p>
<p>The "Central Hall" area is decorated with many sculptures, fountains, and small waterfalls. Over 250,000 plants, special products from all over the world, are planted around it, connected to over a million famous flowers, creating a colorful, flower-filled paradise.</p>
<p>The authorities of the Fair anticipate that the total number of visitors in the spring and summer seasons will exceed 60 million. New York is the largest city in the world, and this fair is the largest World's Fair ever held.</p>

<h3>The Unique Features of the Fu Liancheng Opera School's Performances</h3>
<p>— (Yan Yan)</p>
<p>The Fu Liancheng Opera School in Beijing was the first major opera school in the country, having cultivated countless talents. For example, Yu Lianquan (Xiao Changhua), Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Li Shengzao, Mao Shilai, etc., are all graduates of this school. When I was studying in Beijing in the past, I really enjoyed listening to the performances of this school because their performances did indeed have unique features that were unmatched by other privately organized troupes. Now that I have some free time, I am writing it down for the reference of people in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(1) The operas performed by Fu Liancheng every day are very substantial. They do not rely on star actors to attract audiences, but purely on the opera itself. Because the talent in the school is well-rounded, no opera uses a mediocre actor. They completely focus on having a well-matched cast and a lively performance.</p>
<p>(2) Every opera performed by Fu Liancheng is worth watching. From the opening act to the final act, there is no sense of being too high or too low. This is very different from other troupes, where the first three acts are unbearable.</p>
<p>(3) Fu Liancheng's operas emphasize rules and regulations. No laziness is allowed. Opera enthusiasts can fully enjoy themselves, and opera students can learn from them, making it a good example to follow.</p>
<p>(4) Fu Liancheng's martial operas have well-matched casts and are extremely tightly choreographed. Because of the large number of performers, the performances are lively and captivating, which is unmatched by any other opera troupe.</p>
<p>The above four points are the artistic advantages of the Fu Liancheng school. In addition, because the students in the school do not have huge salaries, the ticket prices are very low. This is also a characteristic of the opera school and cannot be achieved by privately organized troupes. Furthermore, the majority of Fu Liancheng's students are the sons of famous opera stars. The opera stars have extraordinary faith in the school, which shows the importance of the Fu Liancheng school in the Peking opera world.</p>
<h3>The Talented Child Star Hu Rongrong Recovering from Measles</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yong</p>
<p>Starring in "Little Swordswoman" and "Mulan's Birth"</p>
<p>Seeing the continuous stream of Hollywood child star films, one cannot help but think of our own talented child stars who are worthy of cultivation. It is quite sad that since Shanghai became an isolated island, only the Starlight Company, which briefly shone last year, had a film starring the talented child star Hu Rongrong, "A Singer Saves Her Mother." This really makes movie fans yearn for entertainment and eagerly look forward. Currently, I suddenly heard that Guohua Company has invited Hu Rongrong to star in a new film, so I went to the Hu residence in Mingde Lane to inquire about it. Now I am sharing what I have learned through the "Entertainment World" corner to inform movie fans who care about child stars.</p>
<p>The Child Star Recovering from Measles</p>
<p>Rongrong's talent is much more intelligent and clever than other children, and her physique has always been healthy and beautiful. During the New Year this year, because her younger brother Zai Zai had measles, Rongrong, her younger sister Qianqian, and her younger brother Jiji were also infected and broke out in measles. However, the situation went very well, and they have now fully recovered. Their appetites have increased, and their spirits are still more lively than ordinary people. However, her father, Mr. Gui Fen, is still letting his beloved four children rest, temporarily not attending school, but reading books, writing, playing chess, and playing the accordion at home. Rongrong is also personally replying to the many letters from fans and mailing out the photos requested by fans.</p>
<p>"Little Swordswoman" Starts Filming First</p>
<p>As for the new film starring Rongrong, "Little Swordswoman" by Guohua Company, will start filming immediately, with singer Yi Qiuxia and others in supporting roles. Before deciding to shoot this film, around the end of last month, the Guohua authorities had discussed with her father about letting Rongrong star in "Mulan's Birth" before "Little Swordswoman." The script for this film was already written by Rongrong's elder brother Hu Xinling in early October last year. However, because the contract for "Little Swordswoman" had been signed for a long time and should be completed first, Guohua withdrew the new proposal and returned the script for "Mulan's Birth" to the Hu family for safekeeping, to be discussed again after "Little Swordswoman" is completed.</p>
<p>"Mulan's Birth" Educational Film</p>
<p>At that time, I asked Mr. Gui Fen whether the content of "Mulan's Birth" and "Mulan Joins the Army" was similar. Xinling showed me the original manuscript of the former, revealing that the two are fundamentally different. The content of "Mulan's Birth" tells the story of Mulan's childhood and contains a large amount of educational meaning. This script was written in early October last year. Zhang Shichuan of Guohua wanted to start filming it at that time, but he was worried about the time-consuming and costly preparation of ancient costumes, so he returned the original script to Hu Xinling and temporarily postponed the project. Now that the old matter has been brought up again and then stopped, the script for "Mulan's Birth" has been returned to the Hu family again.</p>
<h3>Hu Rongrong's Photo After Recovery</h3>
<h3>A Glimpse of Mao Shilai's Lineup</h3>
<p>— Lü Gong</p>
<p>Zhang Eyun, Yang Shen, and others have performed for more than two golden months, and their contract will expire on May 7. The results have been remarkable and impressive, which must be attributed to the well-matched cast and the skillful arrangement. Following Zhang Eyun, Mao Shilai and others will arrive in Shanghai soon. The Golden Theater has decided to retain Yan Shishan, Guan Shengxi, and Xi Chanlian for another month in order to extract the essence of the fourth and fifth classes of Fu Liancheng and achieve the wonderful effect of complementing each other. Therefore, I am revealing their full lineup below, which I believe will also be welcomed by opera lovers.</p>
<p>Mao Shilai is 20 years old. When he performed at the Golden Theater last year, he gave Shanghai people a very good impression. The opera "Twelve Reds" has been absent from the opera stage for a long time, but it has been able to continue to exist thanks to Shilai. This is because when Liu was captured in this opera, he fell three times in a row, which is something that no one in the female roles today can do. Other operas such as "Heroes and Martyrs," "Little Shepherd," and "Ma Siyuan" have also been widely praised. After returning to Beijing, he worked even harder, practicing singing, practicing his skills, and discussing the operas every day with diligence. He also learned calligraphy and painting from the famous calligraphers and painters Yuan Tongshu and Chen Banding. Mr. Yuan said that Shilai's small regular script has a powerful and vigorous style, with the charm of Tang Dynasty scripture writing. In the Chang'an, Qingle, Xinxin, and Jixiang theaters, he has performed "Jin Ping Mei," "Yu Hu Tang," the full version of "Mu Guiying" (from "Shooting the Wild Goose" to "Tianmen Formation"), "Red Plum Pavilion," and other operas, which have had sold-out performances. This time when he comes to Shanghai, we should look at him with new eyes.</p>
<p>Gao Anglin is 24 years old, the second son of Gao Qingkui, and studies martial roles. He and Yang Shengchun are outstanding members of the fourth class. Shenglin has a loud and sweet voice. Tie Fan's "Midnight Run" and "Picking the Carriage" were personally taught by Xiao Lou and are by no means comparable to those who deceive the world with the Yang style. He was extremely popular in Beijing and Tianjin. He usually likes to draw face patterns for operas. Therefore, his face patterns in "Zhuangyuan Yin," "Si Ping," and "Yan Yang Lou" can be compared to those of his predecessors. His martial skills are also clean and healthy. Opera lovers praise him as a rising comet in the martial roles. This time he is returning with a good reputation, which can be expected in advance.</p>
<p>Sha Shixin is 20 years old. He and Lian Liang are both Muslims. His singing and acting are also excellent. He has a reputation as "Little Ma Lianliang." He excels in acting and wearing elaborate costumes. This is his first time in Shanghai and should give us a fresh impression.</p>
<p>Yan Shishan is 21 years old. This is his third time performing in Shanghai. Shanghai people have already given his art extremely high praise, regarding him as the leader of today's martial female roles. The Golden Theater loves his talent and has decided to retain him for another month. In the future, he will collaborate with Shilai on operas such as "Legend of the White Snake," "Fan Lihua," and "Juan Juan," which will surely cause a sensation in the entire city.</p>
<p>Jiang Shiyu is 22 years old, the son of Jiang Shunxian, and plays young male roles. He has a handsome appearance. After graduating, he studied operas such as "Elegant View Tower," "Exploring Zhuang," and "Flying Tiger Mountain" from the famous amateur performer Bao Danting. His art is already comparable to that of Ye Shenglan.</p>
<p>Ai Shiju is 22 years old and a rising star in the clown roles. Wu Zongye, Shengzhang, Nian Xiao is his teacher for Fu Lu. "Clever Coincidence," "Ci Bajie," and "Herding Cattle" are his masterpieces. The old opera lover Mr. Sun Luan praises him as unique in the clown roles.</p>
<p>Qiu Shengrong is 25 years old, the second son of the late famous Jing role Qiu Guixian. He is skilled in both the copper hammer and the frame. His singing and recitation have his father's charm. Recently, he has been increasingly motivated. His reputation in Beijing has the potential to follow in the footsteps of Jin Shaoshan.</p>
<p>Luo Gong is 28 years old, the eldest grandson of the late famous clown Luo Baisui. He plays civil clown roles, speaks coldly, and has a clear voice. He is also an outstanding member of the fourth class of the school.</p>
<p>Others, such as the solid old male role Guan Shengxi and the painted face Xu Xiaochen, as well as over twenty other civil and martial supporting roles, are all high-achieving graduates of the fourth and fifth classes of Fu Liancheng. They are talented in both civil and martial arts, and they are all gathered together. Once they perform, the Golden Theater will surely have another grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Silver Flower and Silver Willow</h3>
<p>— Sally</p>
<p>Liu Suan, Shushi, Li Ying will become the organizers of the charity sale for the film industry.</p>
<p>Xia Xia's dressing room has more than ten photo albums, some of which contain her historical photos, from birth to the present, everything is complete. She can be called a collector among the movie stars.</p>
<p>Jin Ru is suffering from tonsillitis, the same as what Hu Die suffered from several years ago, and may need surgery.</p>
<p>Yan Youxiang's clothing is the most luxurious and exquisite, especially the spring clothes he has been wearing recently. Some say that Yihua Films is always superior in clothing and scenery, which is not without reason.</p>
<p>Gu Lan Jun owns her own car, with the license plate number 14.</p>
<p>Who is the female actress playing "Wang Baochuan" has become a mystery. It is rumored that there are five movie stars and two Kunqu opera actresses being considered, and it should be revealed in the coming days.</p>
<p>Li Hong said: "I will watch Shaw's 'Pygmalion' three times, because I think this film has the most ideal stimulation."</p>
<p>After Chen Yanyan gave birth to "Little Swallow," she is more distant from her "Little Dog."</p>
<p>A certain famous playwright said that a scandalous news with tragic elements is brewing in the film industry, with the protagonists all being important figures.</p>
<p>The Golden City Monthly recently published a special issue on "Tears of Songs," with rich illustrations and text. The most noteworthy are an article on "Yi Qiuxia's Theory" and dozens of secret stories.</p>
<h3>The Art of Ice Skating (90)</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Lian Junqi and Zhen</p>
<p>The Use of the Body (Continued)</p>
<p>The Fourth Table of Body Positions</p>
<p>Regardless of which side, the first and second positions are commonly used by beginners, so it is essential to know them. The third and fourth positions must be used by advanced skaters. The ice skating patterns and techniques vary from person to person, but they all rely on changes in body position. The ways in which each person uses body position are different, and each pattern has several techniques. Each technique has its own advantages, so it cannot be said that one is necessarily superior or inferior. It all depends on which method is most suitable for the individual. Therefore, in the future, when encountering pattern techniques, we will either show one method or list several methods. This does not mean that there are no other methods besides the method shown, but we can only indicate the path. Readers should create their own variations and strive for accuracy and elegance in the patterns drawn on the ground, without violating the rules set by the International Skating Union. Because there are no fixed rules for techniques, it is best to learn all the different techniques and choose the one that is most suitable and convenient for you.</p>
<p>Various turning techniques all rely on changes in this body position. Therefore, if the various positions can be mastered thoroughly without omissions, progress will be rapid. Otherwise, you will encounter difficulties. Ordinary learners can usually handle the first and second positions on each side, but when it comes to doing four turns or changing sides, they do not know what to do with their hands and feet. This is because the body position is not only used in the first two positions, but is completely different from the usual posture. Therefore, if you do not practice the last two positions on each side, you will never be able to learn various turning techniques, and you will feel that none of the advanced patterns are easy to do. The main reason is the incorrect body position. Therefore, if you do not understand and practice them early, you will either give up halfway or waste your time.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Disturbance in Shanghai during the Third Year of Xianfeng</h3>
<p>(See this newspaper, April of the eleventh year of Tongzhi, Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>During the third year of Xianfeng, bandits attacked the Shanghai County Office, releasing prisoners. They then proceeded to the Daotai Office, looting over four hundred thousand taels of gold from the treasury. Shortly thereafter, the bandits requested that the Observer [Daotai] enter the city. The Observer demanded three things from the bandits: first, hand over the ringleaders who murdered the officials; second, return the treasury gold; and third, surrender military weapons for disbandment. The bandits refused. The Observer then sealed his official seal and went to Jingkou to petition the Grand Coordinator. Initially, the troops under Commander Zhang Dianchen were mostly Cantonese and Chaozhou recruits. Stationed between Jinling and Jingkou, they repeatedly defeated enemy camps, accumulating great wealth through looting. People from their hometown envied them, and countless others came seeking to join. Suddenly, the Grand Commander was transferred to Sichuan, and the troops scattered and became bandits, using Shanghai as a refuge, increasing in number daily. At that time, there was a man named Zhou Lichun in Qingpu who resisted paying grain taxes and resisted arrest, recruiting and enticing various bandits to start an uprising, and colluded with the Taiping rebels in Jinling, attacking and capturing Jiading County. The people of Shanghai were in great panic. On the fifth day of the eighth month, seven hundred Cantonese soldiers stationed in the Inspectorate within Xiaodongdou betrayed and opened the city gates to the bandits, killing Magistrate Yao Mingfu and driving out the Observer and others. On that day, the bandits deployed to defend the city and also captured the four cities of Qingpu, Baoshan, Chuansha, and Nanhui. They attacked Taicang unsuccessfully. Fortunately, reinforcements sent by Rongzhi arrived. Within a few months, they recovered the five districts of Baoshan, Qingpu, Jiading, Chuansha, and Nanhui. Shanghai could not be completely besieged because the southwest, northeast corners bordered the foreign settlement. By the winter of the fourth year, the bandits' tactics were exhausted, and some advocated cutting off the bandits' supplies. Therefore, they negotiated with Westerners to build a long barricade from Xiaodongmen to Laobeimen. With the completion of the wall, the bandits became even more unsustainable. On New Year's Eve, the bandits fled in separate directions, east and west. On New Year's Day, government troops pursued westward to Hongqiao, joining with the local militia and annihilating them. After the success, the Westerners requested the area within the built wall as a concession. Since then, hills have gradually turned into grand buildings. Who would have known that the place of today's bright lights and lavish entertainment was once a battlefield of iron horses and golden spears; the place of buying laughter and enjoyment was once a devastated and scorched zone. This is the record.</p>
