<p>（倫敦）　首相張伯倫今日在下院答覆議員所發關於天津局勢之許多問話、謂英政府深知天津目前爭案所將及於在華其他英租界與公共租界之反響、英國現正與法美兩國維持密切之接觸、英政府不能不相信”政府亦與英政府然、不欲使不和之範圍更見廣大、或使已見困難之局勢更形棘手、外相哈立法克斯勳爵今日曾與駐英日大使重光葵會晤、駐日英大使克萊琪爵士、今日亦圖向日政府闡明局勢、首相又稱、六月十五日有華人與韓人煽動者、一羣集於天津英租界外、英竇漢輕步兵一分隊曾奉命往援英工部局之警察、但在暴衆减至二百人時、卽撤退、天津英租界外仍置有障碍物、英人之出入租界者、悉在障碍物前受嚴格之搜查、且有數人曾受侮辱、易腐之食物運入租界者、皆在障碍物前嚴受檢查、延時頗久、以故仍時有時無、聞毘述法租界之市塲、現仍獲食料正常之供給、天津英租界似尚未作特別佈置、惟英政府現仍時時向該地當局探詢一切、六月十八日之晨、有來往海濱之英商船兩艘、經白河駛至天津、未遭攔阻搜查、總而言之、英國船隻、連拖船與駁船在內、現均遭日軍當局攔阻搜查、上舉兩船、乃屬例外、天津英總領事曾向日總領事提出抗議、克萊琪爵上亦本命與日政府交涉、一般大局、尚未明暸、日方原提引渡四嫌疑犯之要求、似已爲提出一般政策更大的爭點所淆混矣、英政府迄未收到日政府關於該問題之正式來文、現仍望該問題能就地解決、首相宣布英政府現正與法美兩國政府維持至密切之接觸後、謂渠當然將於有最早的可能機會時、續向下院陳述一切、工黨議員漢德森問、政府所提供引渡四嫌疑犯問題應由國際諮詢委員會解決之議、現是吾依然有效、首相答曰、然、前外相艾登問、今是否能假定就首相之言論觀之、凡關心天津局勢者皆明悉英政府志在擔保使運交天津英人所需之糧食安然到達、首相答曰然、吾人現正在研究是點、而將取任何必要步驟、擔保彼等獲得糧食供給、工黨議員諾爾巴克問、鼓浪嶼之封鎖是吾仍舊、首相答、渠信其如是、海軍部出席下院專員魯威麟答覆關於天津附近英國海軍及白河水深之間話、謂最大之船隻能經白河駛抵天津者、爲護衛艦洛維斯托夫號、（九九〇噸）該艦現泊天津、距津三十哩之大沽、泊有其他英艦、此爲較大軍艦所能駛抵距津最近之地點、目前並不認此有何價值、凡應需之艦、在華北海面之諸艦、可資調遺、關於白河水深狀况、按時接有報告、（十九日路透社電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）　此間接近外交部人士頃宣稱、天津市事件成立折衷方案之希望、極爲微薄、內閣外交委員會定於明日開會、討論各種預防措置與經濟報復辦法、前者乃欲預防津巿或發生事端、以致引起危險性質之衝突、關於後者、則在數日之內、倘現行爭執不能作爲地方事件成立友好解決方案、卽當循序實施下開各項措置、　廢止一九一一年英日商務協定、　對於日本貨物輸入英屬各殖民地者、徵收高額進口稅、　限制日貨進口數額、　以特種措置對付日本貨幣、並加緊援助中國法幣、迄至目前爲止、英國政府尚未要求美國予以贊助、以免要挾美國之嫌、但預料英國若果採取强硬舉動、美國亦必參加、（十八日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>日軍封鎖天津英租界，今天已是第七天，本報已經一再評述。英國至今未有堅決明白表示，日軍氣燄愈漲愈高；形勢惡化，已達極點。倫敦來電，雖傳英政府準備循序實施下列各項措置：　廢止一九一一年英日商務協定；　對於日本貨物輸入英屬各殖民地者，徵收高額進口稅；　限制日貨進口數額；　以特種措置對付日本貨幣，並加緊援助中國法幣、但是還在擬議的階段。我們懷疑英國首相張伯倫氏還存着某種幻想·還希望把天津事件作爲「地方事件」成立「友好」的解決。</p>
<p>然而日本不但不遷就張伯倫氏的綏靖政策，幷且更加劇對英國的進攻。因爲日本看破了綏靖政策的弱點，日本明知所謂「綏靖」路綫，就是竭力避免與侵略者發生正面衝突，遇事但求取得妥協，因此無所忌憚的要向英國挑釁了。其决，英蘇談判最近雖仍在繼續進行中。日本擔心未來的反侵略陣綫也許會包括遠東。這一决的天津事件，即是竭力打擊英國，威脅張伯倫，用以破壞英國發動的反侵略陣綫。第三，日不外交攻勢集中於英國，也是執行着希特勒統治下「反共」集團的聯合戰略，而從東西兩方面向英國進攻。意大利報紙公然宣稱：一今之天津事件，係實行全能國所已擬定的偉大計畫，志在摧毀民治國家之一部」。據美聯社電傳：「德國觀察家一致認爲在遠東發展中，德日意頗有一種政治的三角聯盟的意義」。同時，據前天倫敦星期捷報所傳，當天津問題嚴重的今天，希特勒又準備提出「驚人要求」，這更證明了東西侵略者互相呼應的聯繫性。第四，日軍對華軍事最近已日感困難，泥足愈陷愈深，侵略勝利的希望愈來愈渺茫了、因此，乃以壓力施諸第三國——特別是英國，用以轉移日本人民的視綫，並企圖斷絕中國的國際助力。</p>
<p>從上面幾點看來，可知這决天津事件的發生，乃是日本軍閥大規模打擊英國的開端。近來侵略者不絕的對英挑釁，如鼓浪嶼登陸，檢查英商輪，封鎖中國海岸，煽動工潮，傷害英國僑民等等；而英國逆來順受，沒有强硬的對付。，因此又有這决封鎖天津英租界事件發生了。如果這决事件，英國再不決心制止，則英國應有決心退出遠東。英國地中海艦隊司令凱斯將軍說得好：「日本發動天津事件，並獲有德義之贊助，實等於向不列顛帝國宣戰。此種挑釁舉動，務須有以報之。吾人苟能以決心與堅定之立塲，向世界宣示準備以全國之財富工業以及人力，相與周旋，則無須訴諸武力，即可獲勝。反之，倘若猶疑不決，則屈辱之餘，戰爭恐仍不可免」！我們希望張伯倫首相有接受這一類諍議的大智慧。</p>
<p>法文日內瓦講壇報爲瑞士重要報紙之一、頃發表社評、謂日本遭遇中國之英勇抵抗、以後乃轉攻擊白種國家矣、國聯建議、各國單獨援華一舉、業巳生效、西方各國所撐持之中國法幣、已成爲世界上最穩定之幣制之一、而日元則僅有虛偽之價值而已、日本在上海及鼓浪嶼方面俱告失敗、現乃攻擊天津租界、其目的無非在妨礙英法利益、同時復盼美國可持超然之態度、惟美人爲恢復遠東各國實力之平衡計、應積極出面干涉、（十九日電）</p>
<p>（重慶）據塔斯社紐的十九日電、「先驅論壇」報社論、提議如日本繼續封鎖天津及鼓浪嶼租界、美國應卽與之斷絕外交及商業關係、該報力說不顧英法態度如何、美國必須對日堅決聲明、美國雅不願與發動侵略戰爭侵害彼等權益之國家保持友好之外交及商業關係也、（十九日電）</p>

<p>（泰縣通訊）江蘇省教育廳自八一三後、內大部地區淪陷、故教費收入大减、支持不無困難、惟教廳已計劃增籌經費、節省支出、茲將該廳教費情形探誌如决、</p>
<p>全省敎費</p>
<p>蘇省敎育經費、原極充裕、二十六年度之省教費支出預算、計教育行政費三四六·七四四元、高等教育費四三六·八〇八元、普通教育費三·一七四·三一三元、社會教育費四七一·〇六〇、留學經費一〇〇·〇〇〇元、補助費一五三·六〇〇元、推行義教費七五〇·〇〇〇元、各項臨時費七一三·二九〇元、償還債務費二五六·〇〇〇元、合計六·四〇一·八一五元、數字可謂相當鉅大、迨至二十七年以後、江南各縣大多淪陷、蘇北亦屬戰區、該省教育費、乃陷於極端困難之境地、二十七年上半年、省教專款收入、統計三十一縣、收入以四折計算、的計不過三四七·六六一元、二十七年份支出項下、除教齊行政費外、上牛年為二六八·一四四元、下半年為九八·四一六元、二十八年度預算亦未能有所增加、其竭蹶之狀、蓋亦不難想見、此則不能不賴於中央之補助也、</p>
<p>各縣敎費</p>
<p>至於縣教費方面、在二十六年度、各縣教費預算總數為一一·二二〇·八六一元、二十六年十月間雖因戰局緊張、各縣教育局行政事業費以八折發放、而普義社教費仍照舊例支、未加核减、二十七年春、各縣普義社教費、亦仍照原預算例支、如地方財政困難時、再斟酌情形减成發放、關於各縣教育局行政事業費、另編緊縮預算二十七年下半年、各縣教費預算、又重編緊縮預算一决、二十七年度計共緊縮兩决、</p>
<p>整頓計劃</p>
<p>省教廳以教費如此竭蹶、在目前長期抗戰過程中、惟有力求收支適合與自給自足、業已統盤籌劃、在支出方面首重節流、决則整頓收人、關於節流方面、如力求省縣教費預算收支適合省縣教費預算厲行緊縮、確定淪陷區教費收支原則、限制新興事業及修建購置、關於整頓收入方面、如淸查學產、整飭學租、確定教費徵收標準、淸理省縣教育機關經費財產、皆所以在收支適合與自給自足之目標下力謀補救、以免今後教育經費枯竭之危機也、</p>

<p>豆米業市塲因囤戶投機操縱、一再扒進不允吐出、致杜米價格創新高峰、雖經市塲管理委員會竭力勸吿、依然無效、咋日上午九時開市後、起初價格、有續漲趨勢、旋因囤戶進意轉淡、同時本街銷路、亦頗呆滯、於是價格稍趨穩定、與前日之行市略同、頭號常熟眞白粳為二十一元五角、中决各米自十七元至二十元不等、市塲混亂情形稍戢、蓋囤戶深恐租界當局實行制裁、</p>
<p>存米五十二萬餘包</p>

<p>— EL</p>
<p>我們談過了報紙問題之後，便開始接談時事。</p>
<p>從卜先生的觀察歸納起來，他對於時事的結論，大致為：戰事延長到如何程度，誰都不敢推斷。他說：「誠如美大使所說過的一樣，五年，十年，甚至二十年哩」。講到這個問題時，他又說最近與顏惠慶博士在某處席間，大家談起這事，獲得差不多的見解。</p>
<p>在以至少一刻鐘的時間，卜先生分析和解說我們所特別指出的國際問題時，他慈祥沉毅的面部上，不時表現了嚴肅的態度。他坡後所給予我們的答復，我敢老實的說，確是感覺奮興的。</p>
<p>卜先生嘴裏本來啣着烟斗，娘嫋的烟氣至此已跟着我們談話的結束，而同告消逝。我趁着他站起來裝烟，劃火柴的當兒，在這里補叙一段比較輕鬆的事實。</p>
<p>當我們和卜先生談論中國報業的時候，由於卜先生歷年看申報的關係，便講到眼前報紙寄遞到外埠的困難。</p>
<p>「貴校的新聞科，不是有悠久的歷史麽」？我問。</p>
<p>「在上海辦新聞科倒是很適當而需要的，本校的新聞科最近人數未見得多。歷屆畢業生不少往國外以求深造的。」</p>
<p>卜先生在這里提起了我們的同業，大陸報副總主筆吳嘉棠君。—C君和我都和吳君相熟的，他從約翰新聞科畢業之後，便入美國米蘇里大學，—我們不期而然的表示的翰新聞科人材的卓越。</p>
<p>我們的談鋒又轉移到生活起居和旅行上去，覺着談論我們兩人的老本行是要感到枯燥的。</p>
<p>「今年夏季，預備出門麼？」C君問。</p>
<p>「是呀，我很想往靑島去一躺呢。」據卜先生說，卜太太的身體近來欠佳，要是去的話，大的在七八月兩月之中。「在那里」，他說，「我們有一所小的住宅」。</p>
<p>談到旅行，卜先生吿訴我們，他統扯每隔五年返美國一决—他是美國紐的城人，生於一八六四年二月二十二日—最近的一决是在大前年，當戰事在滬爆發的時候，他適在英國。「在倫敦的時候曾遇到郭泰祺和孔祥熙。那時候上海方面呌我暫緩來華，在那里等待一會再說，」他說。不過卜先生終於在去年春回上海，道决離開他的第二故鄉已經有一年半之久了。</p>
<p>「先生回來時的光景，與去滬時，感覺怎樣的不同呢」？我問。</p>
<p>「哇，大不同了」。卜先生搖着頭，直截的回答說。單就學校本身來講，他說，他回來的時候，這里—指梵皇渡—已受到極大的威脅，沈嗣良君—的翰副校長—早把學校遷往租界，即現在的大陸商塲中。起初學生不多，大的祗有二百多人，現在却多至一千二百餘了。</p>
<p>卜先生很關心的提起了其他的幾個著名教會學校，像滬江·金陵·之江等；父談起遷往四川貴陽的復旦·大夏，及一部份在上海的交通大學。他對於教育事業眞顯出了十二分的熱誠關懷。</p>
<p>「聽說貴校有遷回這里的可能，確麼」？</p>
<p>「大概將來有一部份可以遷回來，我們預備先辦一屆暑期學校入手，然後看大局的轉移而定」。卜先生回答說。</p>
<p>「這里的校舍有受到投失麽」？我們望着窗外綠油油的一片草地，四週幽靜的環境，禁不住的問。</p>
<p>「倒沒有」，卜先生很高興的回答。「不過，自從河上那頂橋炸毀之後，要到對河的科學館去，很不方便呢」。</p>
<p>卜先生朝着我們幽默而帶笑的說道：「雖然一河之隔，好像自家屋裹一樣，但是沒有通行證却不能去，而且要坐着船擺渡哩」。</p>
<p>由於這幾句話，便引出了上面一段關於時事問題檢討的談話。</p>
<p>我們的被訪問者繼續着抽他的板烟。由於Dr．W．WYen（顏惠慶博士）而講到伍廷芳唐紹儀等一批老留學生。</p>
<p>卜舫濟先生門墙桃李滿天下，當今不少名公巨卿，都曾受過他的親炙。我們覺得這位七十五歲的老儒，以教育傳道作為終生事業，確是値得尊敬的。</p>
<p>他說駿人先生的尊翁曾在的翰教書，顏博士本人則曾很早的為商務書館主編一部英文字典。無疑的，這兩件事都是教育的根基：他老先生對於顏氏喬梓表示很大的高興。</p>
<p>「唐紹儀等是第一批到美國去的留學生，他們去的時候年紀都很輕；我在哥倫比大學念書時，唐紹儀和我還是同學呢」。卜先生頓時减輕了五十多歲，憧憬着靑春時代的美滿之夢，格外顯得有精神了。</p>
<p>的確，卜先生是「老上海」……「老中國」……叉是許多中國老留學生的老師呢。</p>
<p>卜先生於一八八六年—光緒十二年—來華。</p>
<p>一八八八年長的翰書院。同年結婚。</p>
<p>一八九〇年獲TrinitxCollege名譽神畢博士學位</p>
<p>一九一〇年獲Edinourgh大學名譽神學博士學位。</p>
<p>一九一允年續娶。</p>
<p>一九二丸年母校哥倫比亞大學授以名譽S．T．D．博士學位。</p>
<p>我們暫時請卜先生停滯於五十年前的上海灘上：</p>
<p>「先生初來上海時，外人的生活情狀如伺」？C君問。</p>
<p>「那時候生活程度甚低」，卜先生回答說，「除了教士們薪給較低外，普通人都過着「王孫公子」式的舒適日子，高堂大厦，僕從如雲。物價低　，使得一切開支都减省」。</p>
<p>「平時大家作何消遣呢」？我們神遊於那時生活優裕的外人中間，便這樣的問卜先生。</p>
<p>「遊獵，垂釣是再好不過的運動；那時候一個更舒適的消遣，便是乘着遊艇到鄉間去，差不多大家都備有住家式的遊艇呢？」</p>
<p>卜先牛講完了這幾句話，略停一會，用手在下頷摸了一下，然後吿訴我們一件事：他說，「那時候的中國人總以為外國人都是有錢的。第一批出洋留學生到美國之後、在某船塢中看見白種人做着苦工，和中國的苦力一般，他們竟也大為詫怪呢！」</p>
<p>談到上海的陳跡，我們想起了卜先生著作之一的「上海小史，」因之便請卜先生把他歷年的著作吿訴我們。</p>
<p>依照出版的年份，他所寫的各書如下：</p>
<p>“The　canses　of　ontbreak　in　China”，1900（叙述庚子年義和團事）</p>
<p>＂Sketch　of　Chinese　History＂，1907（中國歷史大綱）</p>
<p>＂Lessons　on　Shaughai　Vernacular＂，1809（上海話教科書）</p>
<p>＂The　Emergencyin　China＂，1912（叙述辛亥革命事）</p>
<p>＂A　Short　Historyof　Shanghai＂．1928（上海小史）</p>
<p>此外他又會譯著過幾本神學的書，並參予譯聖公會「公禱文」等書的工作。</p>
<p>我們的談話在空間兜了幾個圈子，又回復到教育問題上面。</p>
<p>這位白髮教育家不以我們為「外行」的問話者，回答了我們下面幾點：</p>
<p>「先生對於英國的牛津，劍橋觀感如何？」C君問。</p>
<p>「我沒有在那里念過書，不過在那兩校參觀過。他們的教育制度確是很好，可惜太花費了些。他們頗像中國向來的「師傳」制度。不尚合班教授，而互從名師分遊的。」</p>
<h3 id="c87">呂班公寓內發生　離奇情死血案　法兵俄婦作同命鴛鴦　僅發一彈竟連死兩命 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>昨日法租界境內、突發生一離奇之槍殺案、此案確甚神異、因自殺者僅開一槍、而竟有兩人死於非命也、茲將調查所得、誌後、</p>
<p>夫返本國　婦竟移愛</p>
<p>俄婦李保伏西歐（譯音）前曾嫁一英人為妻、故</p>
<p>「依據先生的觀點，中國宜乎取法那一種的教育制度呢？」</p>
<p>卜先生且笑　言：「自然囉，我是要說美國式的」。他的意思是，中國現行的教育制度有採自德國的，也有取法乎法國的，如何纔稱適合，原不可一概而論。嗣後父談到職業教育，他說美國的倒很可以取法。</p>
<p>關於學生們選科的問題，他道：「現在的學生都喜歡選讀實用課程，像醫藥，工程之類，這是很對的。不過哲學在各種科學中實佔着很重要的地位，而不容忽視，從前中國讀書人最講究的倒是哲學呢。」</p>
<p>綜核卜先生的意思，讀書不可太機械，文化終究是重要的東西。人生哲學不僅僅是裝點鬥面的，應該把他放在主位上。</p>
<p>在我們已經陶然，卜先生似乎喟然的一霎間，C君向我示意，大家握着手吿別。</p>
<p>「恕我不能奉陪兩位小步，因為還有客人耍來。」卜先生很謙遜的把我們送出了「卜宅。」（完）</p>

<p>— 張鳳</p>
<p>藝術的話</p>
<p>現在我要抽象地講藝術與中國醫學或有關係的地方相提並論及之。藝術這工夫，是要長時期的熟習。整個的認識，不是一鱗一爪的看法；而其表現却反在一鱗一爪上認出藝術的全身。熟習藝術的藝師，自己表現出來的成績，初未嘗矯揉造作，一任自然，而欣賞者方面有時可以嘆為奇蹟，嘖嘖稱道。及問其所以然，連藝師自家也莫明奇妙，而批評家僅能從旁說明其一二其皮毛罷了。</p>
<p>藝術的第一個條件是重有個性的：——無論是時間的藝術，或是空間的藝術，都不是木版印成，所有出品，不是千篇一律，總有一點個性滲入在內。所以欣賞藝術的人們，在這一點上，能分別出各藝師的手製品或作品，譬如詩文·彫刻，在批評家一見作品，不看題字，而能直接認出某大家的作品者以此。至論醫學又論到診病，這個性的存在，更為複雜而錯綜。因上述純藝術作品中的個性；僅是單方面的，而治病却有醫師與病家兩方面的關係。醫師之用以識別各種病狀由望聞問切各種診法，恃其靈敏的觀感，而得到一種悟會，於切脈法尤然。這靈敏的觀感，有各個的個性存在其中。所以儘有同一師門傳授的新進醫師，其表演却有不同。又病家在同一地方，同一時期得到某種同一的病狀，若然加以同一的治法，而其結果，可以有良有窳。因為病家的個性（氣質）也有不同，故不能同一治法，而槪以成方授予。這就是施治與受治者之間有不同之狀况，推而言之，及於敎育，師徒傳授之間，亦何嘗不然。敎授是一種藝術，那末醫學亦是一種藝術。</p>
<p>藝術的條件多是相對的：——自古以來，藝術這東西，在科學發軔如今時，未能計議出一條鐵一般的規律，範圍藝術的造作，所有藝術的敎科書僅能舉示名稱，說明其已然，不明其所以然。這因為相對的條件在藝術中太多了；拙笨有拙笨的好處，乖巧有乖巧的好處，遲緩疾速相對，整確約略相對，輕，重；過，不及；遲，早，高，下；在詩書音樂中均不能執一以繩，而藝人在這些相對的條件中憑他的經騐，折中而調和之。這折中又不是孟子所謂「一子莫執中」的一定成法之謂，執中要有權，「權」字把住在藝術家的手中。講到熟習的醫師，他們常有一種治病把握，穩拿得住這把握的是他的技巧，是他的經騐，他要治上治下，用重用輕，一憑他的本領。兩個醫師用不同的方法而可以治好同一病症者，可以此說明之。譬如一個畫師一個書家，他們的綫條在紙面上七橫八直地交錯成章，自有他們權度在掌握中。書畫是藝術，治病用藥也是藝術。</p>
<p>藝術是無定型的：——藝術無定型，可以不加說明而能瞭解。我們見雕塑的人像是藝術作品，其翻印的模型是工匠作品；書寫的字畫是藝術作品，臨摩的樣子是藝徒的作品。在書寫及雕塑的原手，呌他造出第二件作品，也許有過不及之處，必不能　樣的成績出在同一手中。那末醫師按着種種不同型的病症，給以種種不同型的方案，在方案與病症間之診察，有藝巧之醫師運用其手腕與智慧而成就的，決不是千篇一律的一套刻板文章。一個病症，適應於兩種看法，其不同方案，只要看其入彀或不入彀，入彀的皆可以治病。</p>
<p>藝術是有時間性的：——藝術的本身有時間性是顯然的事，其理由更不須特別說明。藝人於創造他的作品時，朝晚昨今也有時間上之差異。那醫學的派別和歷史也不消說得，而知其有時間性了；即是診病時候一舉手間，診斷與方案，只要不離其宗，而略有出入輕重，不足為異的。</p>
<p>够了，如此累墜的說明，我想是無益的，不如說些中國醫師如何能够治愈百病的理由，比較但從藝術上說話，較為切實。</p>

<h3 id="c119">氣喘新療法 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— 王完白</p>
<p>氣喘之種類頗多，原因各異，最常見者為「氣管支喘息」，實為一種過敏性之反應，或反射神經之官能病。其特狀為呼吸道粘膜之脹腫，分泌增加，氣管支痙擊，以致呼吸困難</p>
<p>原因</p>
<p>所謂過敏性現象，甚似對生漆有敏感之人，皮膚稍經接觸漆器，即紅腫發炎，成所謂漆咬症者，即屬此種現象，但蛋白敏感則發於呼吸道內之粘膜耳。故對某種蛋白質有敏感性之人，若遇此種蛋白，立可發見呼氣困難之狀，如氣管支炎，鼻喉部病，心腎病，胃腸病，皆為本病之遠因。</p>
<p>至敏感之物質不一，如蛋白質有屬於食物類，吸氣類，代謝類，細菌類等，亦有家族性，地方性，物質性，精神性等不同，說明從略。</p>
<p>症狀</p>
<p>病將發作，往往有先兆，如畏寒，胸悶，胃脹，尿多，精神憂鬰等。至病發則多在夜間睡眠之際，突然氣迫，呼吸漸猛，頸脇胸腹諸肌皆劇動，數分鐘後喘急即達極點，呼氣更難，兩肺膨脹，用力求氣，面色靑白，現驚恐怖，輕者數分鐘或數小時即止，重者須經三五夜方至病極，或必見發熱，然後呼吸易，咳嗽頻，而粘痰出，旣得舒適，每即倦極而睡。然一經刺激，又復再發，甚且愈發愈近而愈長，實為痛苦之病。</p>
<p>治療</p>
<p>科學醫治病，必先求其原因所在，以期除根，不以解救一時之疾苦為足，專家研究氣管支喘息病人中，對蛋白質有敏感者佔半數以上，故最好能査得病者對何種蛋白質有過敏性，如果用某種蛋白質膏置皮上輕劃之，過二十分鐘左右劃處發風疹狀，即表示對此種蛋白有敏感，最好忌而勿食，或避勿接觸，卽可不發。否則用極小量之該種蛋白質，使久服之，亦可養成抗抵之力，而預防不發。</p>
<p>惟中年以上之人，則右法不甚騐，最好診察其有無聯器病為導火綫，往往該病得愈，氣喘即不再發，譬如極簡單之鼻瘜，每以為與本病無甚關係，然割治之後，因而氣喘得愈者，比比然也。</p>
<p>此外對本病之最新療法尚多，業經醫界引用，亦有方見於最近之醫學刋物者，選錄數種於此。</p>
<p>（一）抗壞血酸　法國名醫，用抗壞血病酸（即丙種維生素）治氣喘病，結果良好者，竟佔百分之七十五，並謂此藥對於長期續發性者，較之對於急性氣喘收效更宏云。</p>
<p>（二）自己菌液　用病者發作時之粘痰中所含病菌，加以培養，繁殖後殺其菌，取其菌液，注射皮下，以激發其抵抗力，可先將菌液接種皮面，以試其反應如何，注射時約自五十兆菌數起，每次逐漸增加，日期由五天至七天一次，頗有殊效。</p>
<p>（三）汎用蛋白　即非特殊蛋白質，各國藥廠製品甚多，名稱不一，可就熟用者選擇作長期注射，因其比較便利，用者頗多。</p>
<p>（四）滅菌牛乳　取潔凈之鮮牛乳，置橡皮塞瓶中，隔水煮一小時許，可供注射，初用半至一公撮，隔一至三禮拜注射一次，每次加半公撮，直至三公撮為度，用意與前法相似。</p>
<p>（五）完全血液　就患者之臂靜脈中，以消毒注射器抽取血液，約五至十公撮，立即注射於臂肌內，每星期用二三次，血液可酌量增加，至多可用二十公撮，此法比三四兩條更為穩妥而有效。</p>
<p>（六）人工發熱　醫家臨症所得之普遍經騐，本病一至發熱，每即痊愈，故多有用人工發熱以除病苦者，一如神經性梅毒病，今亦用人工發熱以治之，然病家或有誤以發熱為病體之損失，急欲設法退其熟者，實則反為減弱抵抗之力，而延長病期。至人工發熟之方法，應由醫師選擇而施行。</p>
<p>此外更有電氣治療，光綫治療等，用者不多，不再叙述之藥，如莨菪素，副賢素，麻黃素等，皆能立止喘息，然欲其永不復發，仍須求其病原所在，而作根本之治療。尤當注意者，須知醫學發明，雖日新月異，惜效力所及，祗以體質為限，語云醫者祗能醫病不能醫命，可見生命問題，非藥石所能解決，吾人應謙抑為懷，以求此生命之源也。</p>

<h3 id="c121">夢·回憶·現實 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— 紫金</p>
<p>人們的生活態度，依照日本那位前幾年為了「柏拉圖式」的戀愛而自殺了的白樺派的文人有島武郎的歸納所得，大槪可分成三類：一是把做夢的眼睛一直盯着未來，一個「未來」再一個「未來」：在半空中，架起華麗喬皇的樓閣，自己撰作着未來，有如何璀璨的日子。其二是一味以追念「過去」而遣發剩餘的時間。這一班「過去的幽靈」，用惋惜，嘆息，眼淚，虛幻的光，把一堆廢墟，一座灰色的古城堡，彫飾成一片錦天　地，自己蜷伏在這當中，信仰瞻戀，怡然自得。對於活生生的「現實」旣索然乏味，對於霧樣的未來也懶懶然，像惡魔詩人波特萊爾所樂道的這兩個字眼，全生活只是「沉醉」在過去中，其三是旣不依依於「過去」，也不在「未來」的身上打無謂的念頭，只是抓住現實，肯定現實，在現實的世界裏亦膊打仗。這三種的生活態度，也惟有最後的一種最光榮，最感動人，最値得大筆直書。</p>
<p>「人生茫茫難自料。」我們的未來猶如一片大海，浩浩無垠，我們用不着去捉三摸四；即使荷馬的史詩，奧德賽裏面的那位大預言家Mentor老先生還吃得肥肥地健在着，他也不敢預言你的尊「夢」能否兌現但作為「人」的我們却往往雖已「心照不宣」，而仍成天做夢，這是第一流的糊塗蟲。倘說世事令人憂鬰，憤懣，這世界於你是一個無涯的苦海，你厭惡牠，借一個「夢」躲避，但何不如叔本華，來一服催命藥，直截了當？實際是作為「人」的我們，旣缺少毅力，又痛惜那麽一條多餘的生命，於是便免不了充當「糊塗蟲」。不管怎樣滔滔的雄辯，也還是一大堆遁詞，一大堆廢話！</p>
<p>關於追念「過去，即普通所謂「回憶」，梅特林克曾經讚美過，以為是我們一有生之年的溫室」。我們當然也不能不默認「回憶」所給予我們的溫暖之感。然而一個人的可愛的生命倘僅是安放到回憶的歲月裏聽其悄悄地老，又悄悄地死，那又何必勞動尊脚，到這人世間來走一趟。柴霍甫或者帝俄時代一位權威的作家曾經對我們疾聲喊過：「一切的回憶，那是有毒的！」梅特林克一面在　嘆過去是我們有生之年的溫室之後，一面便也警告着同時這也是一座死城。「如其像一個太被動太迷信的朝由敎徒似的只懶惰地默然滿足於美麗的寂滅的廢址，那麽，我們的過去若是愈光榮愈快樂的話，我們應該愈加懷疑牠。」在一篇題為過去的論文裏，這位比利時的作家吼呌着说：「你們太常常憑　我們的墳墓了。你們以為是回復了我們的生活，勇氣和愛情：而其實是奪了我們的生活，勇氣和愛情。」事實上是：一個人的生活倘到了只剩「感舊」懷昔「傷逝」，這一人在世界上便只能算是一個若有若無的人，或者最多不過是一條幢幢的影子罷了。</p>
<p>夢，回憶之類都是我們的絆脚石，我們都應該一足踢開去，惟有熱烈地愛護現實才是我們惟一的路。</p>
<p>偉大的哥郭理說過：「我們被召到世上來完全不是為了佳節和酒宴，我們是來鬥爭的，因此我們一瞬間也不要忘記我們走進了戰塲。在那裏，而且不能單揀危險較少的地帶；應該像一個好戰士，把我們的一切都投到那戰鬥正劇烈的地方去。」這一些話使到我們很感動，而且給了我們很好的啟迪和教養。一個人倘會去正視現實，在現實中掙扎，沉毅而果敢，像我們那整師整營整團為捍衛國土而作着壯烈犧牲的士兵，雖然「犧牲」了，而一年也好，十年也好，一百年也好，如同偉大的羅曼·羅蘭在高爾基死時所致敬的誄詞中所說：「但最美麗，最神聖的墳墓，却在我們的心頭。」</p>

<p>— 樂還</p>
<p>從商邱到蘭封</p>
<p>幾小時的特等——車頂——車生活，過得夠舒適。在睡夢中覺醒過來的時候，車已停在一個小站上；太陽正昇在空中，滿天都　着彩雲，是淸晨的時候。</p>
<p>「軋……軋……」傳來很輕微的震動聲，同志們都散落在車站附近洗臉，誰都沒有對這聲音注意。</p>
<p>震動聲漸漸淸楚了，遠處紅霞裏發現兩顆黑點；「這是飛機——」車箱裏同志們中已有人在吶喊起來；站上也鳴着警報，負着輕傷的同志，都迅速地向四周麥田中散開。祗有少數重傷的同志，安心地留守在車箱裏。</p>
<p>我們先把公文箱從車頂上搬了下來，因為太笨重的緣故，不便奔跑長距離，就在離站約百公尺的側面大樹下隱蔽着；附近有個輕傷的弟兄，正在鎭靜地嚼着大麵。</p>
<p>飛機漸漸近了，兜了一個圈子，目標準對車站，但四周空虛得很，祗有幾節大半空着列車，無聲無息的躺着，車頭也早已在警報發出時駛遠了。</p>
<p>它加快速度，沿鐵軌上空掠過，高處掛下兩個銀色鐵蛋，鐵蛋和空氣摩擦出尖銳的噓噓聲，我們目送它下來，直到將近頭頂時，才緊閉了眼。</p>
<p>「轟」聲音終於來了；在響聲下，祗感覺到有許多東西掉在我們身上，但並沒有多大分量。空氣中夾着火藥，灰沙，鼻孔也將給它阻塞住了；眼是根本沒法張開。幾分鐘後，平靜的車站上又開始在活動，我們張開眼，在灰霧中，見那位嚼着大麵的弟兄，正在那裏喃喃地自語，撅着嘴撥去麵碗中的泥灰。樣子很可惜泥灰糟了這碗大好的麵條兒。</p>
<p>過去不到五十公尺的地方，圍着一堆人，是那蛋落中的地方，沒有死傷人，祗劈了一枝小樹，破壞和平的徒給予人們的不是憂慮，只有憤怒。</p>
<p>二十分鐘以後，車繼續行進，但不多時又在民權站停止了。聽說是給負傷同志換藥，每天總有一次，我們趁這機會到附近小鎭上去補充肚子。</p>
<p>那裏市容相當熱鬧，店鋪看來是臨時搭起來的；老百姓很多在街上呌賣。大砲聲，機槍聲，雖是越打越近，可是他們說寗死也不願離開自己的家。他們每家都有一根或幾根毛瑟槍，一旦有機會的時候，就可靠着它來幹一下。</p>
<p>負傷同志的換藥時間，結束在十一點鐘之前，正午又是開車的時候了。我們回向車去，見尾部多掛上了三節「華僑救護隊」的汽車。車旁坐立着十多個二十內外的男女靑年，穿着一律的制服，套着紅十字會的臂章，由一個四十開外的外國人帶領着，是挺活躍的一羣。</p>
<p>我們同一的主張，就是立刻到他們車上去訪問。</p>
<p>申明來意後，外國人很熱誠的招待我們，他講得一口流利的國語。</p>
<p>他生長在南洋，父親是中國人，母親是英國人，他雖是一個有年紀的人，但愛國的熱情却不後於在祖國的一般年靑的孩子。這次戰爭開始後，就在南洋募了一注經費，率領着十多個在該地讀書的熱血靑年，投到祖國的懷抱裏來。這羣同我們一樣年輕的男女孩子，由老先生一一介紹，熱烈地握着手，有秩序地相互報吿各人以前的遭遇，他們都能講流利的國語。新識的朋友，流露出像舊有的情感，我們已打得一片火熱。</p>
<p>將開車的時候，他們　切地要求與他們同車，我們沒有推却，把箱子和行李搬了上去；因為太陽曬得厲害，我們就鑽進救護車裏。</p>
<p>「火車上坐汽車倒也是很難有的　！」</p>
<p>一路上談着話，唱着歌，直到夜裏車抵開封的時候。</p>
<h3 id="c124">印象的山遊（續） <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 黎錦明</p>
<p>很快到了南天門下面了，我發現一些巨石，好像彫塑師塑成的怪獸一樣，上面題有名家的字；有些在山頂上的，則蟬聯魚續，瓦一樣覆着。其旁一個巨卵形的，陡地從崖畔土隙中矯吐出來，華蓋一般覆在馬路上面。人們從下面過，也許感覺驚險罷，可是我們都習慣這個恒態了，因為有人說，這個懸空巨石在一千個世紀以前也許就這般的，在南嶽成為造物者的工作品時就這般的。不過近年在修開馬路時，認為有天然的力量，有意使它成為這個形勢。</p>
<p>南天門脚底路旁，有一隻縮在茅草矮樹中間的小蓬子，住着一個賣茶的和尚，這和尚高岸，古樸，穿一件上了補釘的袈裟，跟小驛路旁飯鋪子的老闆一般，當面兜攬客人們喝茶。</p>
<p>我們發現這和尚正不算笨拙，他利用了路旁那個精美的石建凉亭。凉亭後面，泉聲潺潺，仿佛豆子撒在玻璃上一樣。和尚把茶端出來時，說：</p>
<p>「好泉水哪！好泉水哪，冷的熱的隨意。熱的喝了補脾，冷的喝了淸胃，沒一樣不周全，少年人喝了強筋骨，中年人喝了長神智，老年人喝了壽　無疆。好泉水哇！」</p>
<p>大彭以為這些話祗是兜攬飲客的，經過和尚的否認，一面帶了我們走到這泉流所經過的石井旁邊。所謂石井，不過一道瀅净的，織塵不染的石罅罷了，泉從上面下來，淸澈的發出一絲鳴聲，而目透出一股陰涼的空氣。和尚又點着說：</p>
<p>「吿訴你吧，先生們，早年唐朝詩聖杜甫來遊南嶽，就在這地方住了下來。那時候南天門下面有所小小菴子，空著，詩聖住下來幾乎有四個月久。這四個月裏面，他吃的是薇和蕨，荀子和野蒿；喝的呢，這古井的泉水。喝了這泉水以後，他四個月內，人也年輕了，外貌也飄逸，寒酸模樣也改了，當時住在山頂的法師，（屬道敎，）稱讚他說，這麽下去，你可以成仙嘍，的確，杜甫詩聖如果下決心過下去，他的確可以成仙的。杜甫呢，他又要下山，忘記不下一官兩職，三餐豐盛，混到耒陽，東找朋友，西問相知，困居客棧，三天沒有進飲食，虧得耒陽縣官子認得人，把他搭救了；說是半個官還沒提，一餐飯就漲死啦。」</p>
<p>後段事是我們知道的，但前一段眞的成了新聞。</p>
<p>和尚是好生的，他的伴侶祗有一隻白呌雞，一條狗。他好好的看護這隻雞，用稻子喂它，喝的也是淸泉。它活得很閒適，驕傲，跟客人們拿的手仗挑戰。可是這條狗却瘦稜稜的，夾着尾巴，晦着臉，吃的是紅薯，有時，吃一口，「嗯，嗯」地哼兩聲，忽地一溜烟般向山下面跑了，一會，又失望地一溜烟跑回，忽遽地伏在芧篷下面。</p>
<p>「這傢伙眞是不得其主而事，」二彭說。和尚聽了，笑了一笑。</p>
<p>七</p>
<p>南天門旁邊，又有一所尼姑菴，菴子狹小，卑陋，陰沈，一個約五十歲的肥胖老尼當門坐着，見着靑年男子，談話時喉間現出一種沙音。</p>
<p>我和大彭一樣，有些憎惡這種女人，她們太虛偽，違反生活條件，又那麽傲心殞志，不承認自己一生的不幸。我們怱怱的離開這地所，趁着夕陽，往上再走。</p>
<p>顯然，這五里路以內的範圍，氣候突然變凉了，風括得汪汪的呌。沒有樹，風的響聲不知道為什麽那麽烈。脚下面的雲在游移，景緻都被蒙蔽着，像渲了一塊水墨。</p>
<p>從這一帶仰看視融峯，覺得不彀偉大了，　　禿禿的，祗有幾顆崖石的點綴。聖帝廟釘在巖尖上，像一　蒼蠅。</p>
<p>路的峻拔，行步很感受痛苦。但這一段最後的前進行程，是表示一個人活到六十歲的毅力的。</p>
<p>頃刻間，抵達上對寺了。剛是號着，因為以上再沒有屏蔽，它才呌得那麽起勁，閉上眼，一定可以發現自身在一處波濤壁立的處所。</p>
<p>剛走進當着大門的庭院，主持接待事務的和尚出來了。他因為發現我們沒有乘轎，樣子變得隨便起來，站在街沿，大聲大　的說：</p>
<p>「到得早呵！……脚跑腫了吧！」</p>

<p>性力不僅為保障吾人生命的必需品，且為繁衍子嗣，快樂人生之原素。當然不應使之衰退，但有一個性力消失後的人，他在精神方面與肉體上的表現，常顯出衰老而頹唐的現象，其壽命大有朝不保夕之槪。故性力一旦有減弱預兆，實為其人生命危殆的開始，照醫學研究之所得，人的性力由於自己不知衛生，斵傷而衰退的，常常比較由於年齡增高而衰退的更覺容易，且更衆高。</p>
<p>性健不僅男人所自誇，並亦為女子所愛慕，妻子看見丈夫壯健可愛的體魄亦正常之性力，為過度縱慾所削弱時，常常會用警惕的言語去提醒他，使他覺得自己身體的寳貴。還有許多很關心丈夫的精力的女人，常因丈夫婚前的自凟斵傷自己精力使她心裹很痛苦，這是什麽緣故呢？這是因為要影響雙方的愛情之故。男子性力渙散，再也不能刺戟女人的心窩，使之如魚得水，樂在其中。試想，她　不要芳心如搗嗎？</p>
<p>本來人之性慾須至四旬以上方漸漸衰退，但若早年有自凟遺精，及荒淫縱慾，則雖在靑春之時，已吿腎虧，此時之治療自不能大意而疏忽，依本人臨診的經騐所知，凡早洩遺精，腎虧不育，純由主宰性慾之靑春腺減低其作用所知，故服以尋常製劑，或不對症的療法，頗難奏效，故必須服以德國眞正動物靑春腺素製劑男用「補體康」方有顯著的功效，因「補體康」之成分，除滲入補腦之燐質外，完全以雄壯動物之睾丸精素為主體，按日呑服三次，連服三月，自能腦系充足，性力充沛，以達返老還童之目的，歐美無數著名之腎病專家，均知該劑之確實功效，補腦，補腎，補血均奏神效，其女用「補體康」為純粹卵巢內分泌劑，有調經種子之工。俄國勞大醫科楊道南著。</p>

<p>— 盛在強醫師</p>
<p>咳嗽是四季常有之病，而夏季的咳嗽，其危險却正不減於其他的季節。因為夏天的咳嗽，受到炎熱天氣的影響，吾人之抵抗力不免薄弱，而宿有結核菌的肺病患者，因抵抗力薄弱而使癆菌（卽肺結核菌）活動。如再加以無情之咳嗽，則病家身體益難支持。此時如能採服德國徒梅博士發明之「補肺拿爾」，亦須服用後三小時內，卽可鎮咳化痰。保護肺部之健全。同時在另一方面而言，「補肺拿爾」又是根治肺病的特效藥。服後能增加食慾，增加病人的抵抗力。所以肺病患者，服本劑尤得藥到病除之妙。</p>

<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>在夏季，因為衣衫的單薄似乎對於肉感的刺戟特別來得容易，而色慾過度的靑年，因為情慾的衝動，每不能自制，在這環境之下，就有不少的靑年，走上自凟之途，自凟旣已開始，就很容易成為習慣，不久以後，必有遺精現象，精液不斷地流洩，身體必受其斵傷過度而發生種種的衰弱症象，如發育不全，腦弱健忘，神經衰弱，耳鳴心悸，頭痛失眠，腰酸背痛等病象，婚後則有早洩陰痿，不能生育等痛苦，而造成家庭間種種的不幸，因此，靑年應格外的潔身自好，患有上述各症者，尤應注意夏季的攝養常識，此時第一應戒絕煙酒，睡前用冷水摩擦局部，或用溫水坐浴，要淸心寡慾，勿涉邪念，並應服「耐而斯遺精片」以羣問精關制止遺精，凡因由遺精過度而引起的衰弱症象，都可用睾丸精質製劑男用「補體康」治癒之。</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師</p>
<p>淋病是預後十分不良之險症。故治療切忌敷衍兒戲，無奈淋病患者大多　於環境，因於經濟，旣無堅決治療之恒心，復無持久之治療經濟，以致往往弄得功敗垂成之境，是實可惜之事。</p>
<p>故淋病患者，必須處處認眞擇生，認眞治療，認眞選藥，始可免於　事。蓋許多淋病患者，多失治於不知不覺之間。余在臨床上曾遇到不少之頑固老白濁，其經過莫不由於病家自己漠視其切身的治療問題也。</p>
<p>但是病家雖有認眞治療的決心，而沒有認眞擇取治療方法之智慧，仍不免於誤人岐途。例如淋病內服藥中，患者往往信未經醫家介紹過之誇大巨型廣的淋藥，濫行呑服，結果症狀往往出於意外之變惡。</p>
<p>「克淋儂」一藥，是德國彼德博士，費無限心血所發明，並承世界各國醫家熱烈贊助，紛紛採作臨床上實騐之用，結果幾有百分之百之最高成績，而復由余輩醫家負責介紹，於是淋病患者咸知遵守醫家所指示而服用。</p>
<p>「克淋儂」，莫不應手取效，成為世界治淋藥中最具權威之淋病特效藥。凡男女一切淋病，非服用「克淋儂」，余敢斷定絕對不能斷根。如服用「克淋儂」，余敢負責保證其根本治癒，然必須患者謹守　生及決心服用此劑，始可達到此目的。若淺嘗卽止，及不守　生之道，恐雖金液銀丸，必難起此痼疾—淋毒矣。</p>

<p>無人不有這樣的感想：淋梅的病原菌，究竟是寄生於尿道內之那一部份？何以用了許多時候的醫械藥液洗滌，没有根本解决？而且反而天天厲害起來？這完全不知道淋菌在我們身上生活和活動的情形。原來淋菌自從不潔的性交以後而傳染，其初不過侷促于前尿道之一隅。此爲急性淋初期時之淋菌的生活。但是淋菌原爲善竄之細菌，如遇有不良之內服藥，及醫械手術，藥水洗滌，刺破尿道內之粘膜，反使淋菌侵入，無異開門揖盗，爲害較之服用劣藥更大。良以在急性淋的時候，尿道粘膜刺激作痛腫大，雖不用器械洗滌。猶恐其腐爛，何况又用粗硬的器械，爲之變本加厲乎？若是淋病已轉入慢性，淋菌已由粘膜而入血液，及內生殖器，局部的尿道洗滌法，有鞭長莫及之感了。所以要治淋病。必以科學爲根據。余恒用德國静電療法，及「克淋儂」，使局部與全身的淋菌，無所逃避，一網打盡，因爲「克淋儂」是具有使全身細胞發揮抗淋殺菌的功效，並包圍之。一方又有静電療法，透射尿道內，其殺菌力勝過局部器械洗滌法千萬倍，而毫無刺傷尿道粘膜之危險。故爲醫家一致承認的超人療法　診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日起每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角。並贈價值一元之「性病全書」一册。</p>

<p>— 蘭燕</p>
<p>從道星期起，各校都在舉行考試，到本星期尾，暑假也就得開始了。</p>
<p>在暑期中，各種暑期學校，都趁這炎熱的四個星期中間，為學生們補習一點功課。單以兒童說，暑期中的「夏令兒童健康營」之類的組織，也將應運而生，不過，由種種取費上講，這些「健康營」也只週一班中產階級家庭的子女，舒適地度過這個暑期的；一般貧苦家庭的子女，簡直無從說起！</p>
<p>現在，我想特別為本市貧苦兒童作一個誠懇的推荐，這就是在暑期中特別舉辦的：「夏令兒童會。」</p>
<p>這個會創辦到現在，已經有二十多年歷史，創辦的地點，遍及全國，但對於兒童，幾乎一概不收費用，雖然有些地方，收五分至二角的書籍費，但這筆低微的小費，將來暑期終了，還是要還的，所以收五分二毛錢的原因，只是防止小學生把書籍撕破罷了。</p>
<p>訪問吳力先生</p>
<p>現在把我訪問的經過，和今年暑期上海這一類「夏令兒童會」的詳情，報吿給讀者。</p>
<p>主待全國夏令兒童會的，是圓明園路的中華基督宗教教育促進會。</p>
<p>現在負責進行一切兒童會的負責人，是一位吳力先生，他也是促進會幹事之一。</p>
<p>我和他足足談了有半小時以上，這位吳先生，拿了許多印刷刊物給我，並且吿訴我許多寳貴的材料。</p>
<p>他自己對於這個兒童會就盡了很大的力量，他新為兒童會編了兩冊讀本和一冊詩歌，一冊剪貼。道都是供給各地兒童會用的課本，道些畫，都照成本賣出去，並不賺一點點錢的。</p>
<p>今年有三十所</p>
<p>這個會創立的經過，是遠在一九一八年，有一位美國的鮑偉文博士初到中國來，他先在上海試辦幾所夏令兒童會，後來又推行到各地。</p>
<p>直到去年為止，各省各地舉辦的夏令兒童會，已有一萬六千多所，服務員（都是各省各地教會學校高中及初中學生）有五萬人以上，會加入夏令兒童會的兒童，總數達五十八萬人以上。（這位鮑偉文博士在前年，一九三七—已在美逝世）</p>
<p>去年暑期，上海還有十九所這樣的兒童會。</p>
<p>今年暑期叉快來了，教育促進會已分函各地教會舉辦夏令兒童會。</p>
<p>現在上海一處，決定舉辦的確數，雖不得而知，但現在已經知道，決定舉辦的，計有滬江大學，東吳大學，之江大學，天安堂（麥家圈），中西女塾，諸聖堂（辣斐德路），慕爾堂，淸心女中，裨文女中，淸心男中，懷恩堂（大西路），修德小學（卡德路口），聖彼得堂（愛文義路），惠中中學等處，，預定舉辦的會所，大的總在二十到三十所。</p>
<p>游擊區的會所</p>
<p>除了各省各地同時權續舉行以外，而對於各游擊區，也仍舊繼續舉辦，如已經來信申請決定舉辦的游擊區，計有南京，今年決定辦二十所，收留兒童一千八百人；杭州，決擴大運動，增加兒童會會所；山東泰安，今年決定辦一百所，此外無錫，蘇州等地，也決定繼續辦理。</p>
<p>貧苦兒童居多</p>
<p>現在讓我們談一談這種夏令兒童會的內容：</p>
<p>當然的，這是一個由教會主持的兒童暑期學校，但是在抗戰期中，宗教者深入戰區，為抗戰所盡的力量，我想誰也不能吾認的罷。允其是現在各游擊區的舉辦學校及這一類夏令兒童會，也非得由教會者辦，吾則，處處受限制，根本就做不得事情。</p>
<p>這個夏令兒童會所收留兒童的對像，是一般貧苦失學的兒童。（去年卡德收容所中的兒童全部受過夏令兒童營的教育）在暑期以前，設法在工人貧民區域，通知他們的家庭，所以每决報名的兒童都非常踴躍。</p>
<p>在他們一個小册裏說得好：「…在火熱的暑期裏，尤其是那些窮苦的小朋友們，不是在外面任意奔走，便是悶守在簡陋窄狹的家裏，他們如能在一個地方聽聽故事，做做手工，一起玩耍，一起讀書，不是進了樂園麼，　」</p>
<p>敎讀課程內容</p>
<p>這學樣的開學期，大約在七月十號左右，也就是暑期開始以後，上課時期的四星期到六星期·上課時間，有的是上午，有的是下午，每天上課時間的三小時。</p>
<p>學生所讀功課，除了「宗教」以外，大概有以下幾項：識字，唱歌，故事，衛生，游戲，手工，服務等項。</p>
<p>在過去，他們特別注重公民訓練和講抗戰故事。但現在，公民訓練已經改去了，講故事，關於抗戰的，成份已經很少了。</p>
<p>一般貧苦兒童，能够在這時候接受一點教育，這眞如宗教家所說：「入了天堂！」</p>
<p>我們對於教育促進會及全苦兒童設立的兒童（甚至於成人的）’學校，以後推行到長期成立才好。</p>
<p>因為，中國成人及兒童的文盲，實在太多呵！</p>

<p>第十二回　紅粉殲仇難消孼障　綠窗談愛孟締良緣</p>
<p>那天潘佩英　袁淑文　別以後，回到家裹，一夜天速睡都睡不着，眞是喜而不寐。她決定明日到雪堰橋去訪　趙樂天，一回兒想到趙樂天不知娶了妻沒有？因想剛纔倒沒有探問一下袁淑文。旣而想到　話似乎不好意思問她，而且她最初還以為我與趙樂天已經結　同居咧。明天去訪問趙樂天，而見到他的夫人，他的兒女輩，很覺使人有些難堪。不過我去也本無別意，只是表明心跡而已。為了我當初這封冷淡的回信，使他大為憤恨失望，可是我倘然不如此的　，立刻使他有生命危險。後來幾决要寫信給他，說明眞相，已　此機會。而他的後來兩封信，我一封也沒有見到。以後便是他的死耗了，這張登着他戰死信息的報紙，她至今還　存着，他明日一定帶去給他看。最使她　過的，就是她的意志不會　明，而趙樂天已經死了。在他以為我是負了他，而飲恨以終。幸而他沒有死，我就有一傾我鬱積的胸懷，我只要說得明白，他能諒解我，我便一切無怨了。到了明天吃過中飯，她便到雪堰橋來，果然一訪問，就訪問到趙樂天的住址。一所小小的半西式的房子，外面有個短鐵門。鐵門之內，雜植着各種花木。潘佩英輕輕的按了一按門鈴電鈕，裹面就聽得在在的一片犬聲。佩英這時心中忐忑着，她想米開門的，不是一個少婦，或者是一個孩子吧？誰知來開門的是一個白髮老人，胸前束着一個白　身，是個燒飯司務光景。另有一條白色捲毛的狗，也從老頭子脚邊，對着佩英只是呌。那老頭子見了佩英，也是顯着很詫怪情狀，便問：『找誰？』佩英道：『趙先生在家嗎？」老頭子又把她自上而下的看了一遍，方慢吞吞的說道：『在家！』佩英就給了他一張名片，這名片上，只有「潘佩英」三個字。老頭子一面把三字念着，一面便開門讓她進去，　她到一間小小的似乎會客室的屋子，請她坐下了。佩英到了這屋子裹，四面亂望。先看看牆上有什麽照片，或是他個人的，或是與人家合照的。那知不但與人合照的無有，連個人的照片，也沒一張。（一四一）</p>
<h3 id="c137">「都會三女性」觀感 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>＂Broadway　MWsketeers＂</p>
<p>華納公司出品　國泰大戲院映</p>
<p>看了「都會三女性」之後，我頗為感動。當最後一個塲面：康妮和費重復在那個小咖啡店裹作一年一度的碰面時，伊薩蓓莉却死了，留下一個孩子姝蒂，却無知地摹倣着大人的舉動，把盃子擲到壁爐中去。這人間的苦味使我禁不住有點衝動，友情的可感和人事滄桑兜的莫來由的衝一胸來；過後想想我禁不住替我這脆弱的心靈感到悲哀，一面也禁不住深為那種小資產者廉價的同情心泛出苦笑。可是，於此也足以證明，我是祇能寫一點近乎雜文的觀後感之類的東西的，太容易感受往往影響到對於對象的評斷的正確。好在我所寫的正是表白一個觀衆對某張影片所感受到的凍西而已。</p>
<p>以我這個小資產者知識份子來看，「都會三女性」是有一個很動人的含有豐富的人情味的故事的：三個在孤兒院中「交極莫逆」的女性，離開孤兒院後彼此音訊杳然了，某一天在報上發現其中之一因表演裸舞被拘，要罰餒三百元才能釋放，於是其餘兩個便都不的而同的去營救，出來以後他們一同到昔年常去的一家小咖啡去坐坐，的定此後每年在此地相見一决。第二年，三人之一的伊薩蓓莉（瑪格蘭林姗飾）因為經了一個無賴的誘感和丈夫離異了，那個無賴把她的一些　蓄和首飾轍光，繼叉向一個流氓借了一票錢，終於為流氓所殺死，而伊也和她的女兒一同被綁，借此向她原來的丈夫勒索，因為風聲緊急，又準備把她們撕了票然後遠遁，這時候伊為救她女兒的生命起見，使揑了登有她們照片的報紙跳樓自殺，而當第三年她們在那家不咖啡館又該碰面的時候，便祇有康妮和費以及她的女兒姝蒂了。</p>
<p>這個當有人情味的故事，作者是用一個和樂的家庭來作陪襯的，道是一個聰明的手法，他因之使我們對那個不幸的伊薩蓓莉更加同情，而把琵琶別抱的她不寫成一個蕩婦而寫成一個「人」，（就是對那個表演裸舞的費也如此）更是我們的劇作者可以學習的地方。</p>
<p>劇情的主綫是在伊薩蓓莉身上的，瑪格蘭林姗在這裹的戲也演得極好，可是在宜傳上，却强調所謂「琪恩哈難第二」的安秀麗丹的春意盎然，眞是莫測高深之至。其實，論戲的本身，安秀麗丹所飾的那個脚色旣是决要，論演技，安秀麗丹也是及不上瑪格蘭林姗的。至於曼麗蕙爾蓀所飾的康妮，則更為决要</p>
<p>除此「都會三女性」之外，童角珍妮潔撥曼的演技是也應該提一提的，她比秀蘭鄧波兒年輕，也沒有秀蘭的那種見了使人惹厭的少年老成腔，至少，她是的的確確像個孩子。也許，這就正是我所以歡喜她的緣故。</p>
<p>瑪格蘭林姗等不是第一流的紅星，戲院當局，也是把這片子作「小片子」做的，但是憑良心說，這却是一張不壞的片子，就是導演的手腕，也頗不弱。</p>

<p>裸體問題引起爭執</p>
<p>紐約城最近舉行的世界博覽會，主議為「創造人類的樂園，建設明日的世界」，其中羅列不少珍奇美化的東西·關於遊藝方面，凡東西洋特出的戲劇，歌唱，音樂，舞踊，節目數百種，每日輪流更換，有一種大規模的集體舞蹈比賽，為欣賞的中心，將綿延七月之久，但因為參與競爭的太多，表演不免稍濫。大會當局近日特組督察部，勒令紐約市諸舞女及嚮導女，在會塲表演花式舞，不得過火，並將身體下部多加覆掩，以免游客發生惡感。殊不知此令一下，陡然引起藝術界的軒然大波，一派以為裸體藝術是本屆博覽會宗旨所在，否則塲中何必陳列維納斯女神考匹特愛神諸大理石像；一派以為靜態的美與動態的誘，應有分野。而諸舞女，藉口維持生計，竟組織「全美裸舞家聯合陣綫」向大會當局進攻。中有名跳舞家三十人，於本月上旬，假座博覽會塲地之古巴新邨，舉行其首次「聯席會議」。美報競載會塲唇槍舌劍情形，謂開幕時，主席古巴舞蹈家洛雪佳康莎拉女士，發表激越的演詞道：「裸體藝術是本屆博覽會主題所在。不穿衣履的身體，充分表露純潔，美麗與天然，所謂將引起游客發生惡感，不知何所據而云然？這些禁止我輩裸體的，想必他們自身萎衰，不能逼視我們健美的體格罷了。」其次由會員汽球舞名家暨美容協會幹事伊茄鮑格演說，她以為「任何女人僅僅卸盡衣服，也算不得模特兒；眞正的人材必需富車載藝術上的陶冶。」羣衆聞言，拍手狂呼，鮑格女士也就高喊，「阿美利加裸體家聯合起來」的口號。一時會塲混亂，主席急用小槌擊桌，喊「秩序！秩序！」稍靜之後，又有康德小姐起立發言，說道：「裸體是返乎自然，毫無罪狀可言，試問我們是出賣性感還是出賣藝術的！我們倘一再無端受辱，名譽勢必掃地，而被目為下流了。故堅持裸體也就是維護藝術。」時秩序又大亂，主席又呼靜。過一會，另由蕾妮小姐發表見解，伊主張發一宣言，明白擁護裸體藝術，她道：「我人必有一天，澈底實行裸體化，返歸自然天眞的世界，惜乎現在還做不到……」說到這裏，忽然攝影師紛紛闖入，諸會員四出，準備卸衣拍照，大會也就宣吿延會云。</p>

<p>（三）成績：玉蘭自該校臺柱趙金蓉躍校後，劇藝更加倍進步，前者現已被該校選為旦角臺柱矣！彼自成名後，每次實習公演時，戲碼非大軸即壓軸，而每一演來無碰頭好之時甚少，憶本年四月間，余接友人函　，玉蘭之　　失潤時，暨時停止演唱，因此該社獻藝之戲院之作曲家制度者，大有人在，恢復嗓音後首次公演「王寳山」於該戲院，海報甫出，未二時餘即吿座滿，臨時加凳者不下百餘人，玉蘭之劇藝受人歡迎，由此可見一般。彼之入校至今瞬已五載，本年終為其畢業時期，一切經騐及成績，當均在玉茹之上，玉茹入校甫三秋，演劇之經騐甚少，僅可說正在追逐玉蘭，而不敢說可與玉蘭相頡　也。</p>
<p>（四）做派：玉茹因天生身體太肥，故不宜演任何正工做派之大戲，只宜演些小家碧玉之裝束，玉蘭則做工細膩，除演繁重之悲劇外，如其偶演大家閨秀之裝束，亦甚能刻畫入徵，此玉茹之不如玉蘭也。</p>

<p>就是上面所說的，瑤卿富有時，鳳卿夫婦時常聽到閒言碎語，敢怒而不敢言，及至鳳卿經濟日益充裕，瑤卿除賴授徒維持生計外，別無半點額外收入，夫妻烟癮也都很大，每月總是入不敷出，眼瞧着二房裏出門一趟就有整萬的鉅款存到銀行裏，未免有些羨慕眼鏡。倘是往日雙方有好感情的話，當然逢年按節也可以向兄弟通融一下，可是歷來都同仇人一般，雖是難到極點，也不好意思向他們去開口的。碰巧鳳二又是服從太太調度的，縱令他本人還念起當初大哥有提携之德，有時想送幾文給大房墊補開銷，然而一聽夫人挑撥之言，也就置之不顧了。</p>
<p>瑤卿這人也很風雅，對於書畫金石都很有硏究，因最喜畫菊，所以別署菊痴，平生所積藏的漢玉極多，鑒別力亦不弱，從前原想把硯秋敎出來，自個晚年也可以有點依靠。誰料程氏成名後，對他並不怎樣知恩報德，故而他一氣又把所有的能耐傳授給程玉菁和他的嗣子幼卿了。無奈他們兩人扮相全都太苦，出演幾次，成績全不很好。他自個才覺悟到現在的年月却不比從前了，以前他和陳老夫子孫怡雲等都是憑藝術不憑臉子好醜的，而今只要扮相漂亮，就可賺大包銀，所以他後來凈收坤角徒弟，新艷秋章過雲杜麗雲等前後不下數十人，都算王門弟子了。近年他自己却不親自敎授，全由玉菁每日替他代勞，偶爾高興，也許親自說說，好在學的人志在掛掛名，同時玉菁又曾得到他的眞傳，當然也差不了許多的，只是他六十多歲的人還依此為生，而他三弟麗卿每日目背包裏向各館子唱零碎，他們的晚境，全　有錢有子的鳳二差得多。老供奉回想當年，也不勝有今昔之感吧！（四一）</p>

<h3 id="e1">British Cabinet Committee Discusses Economic Retaliation Measures Against Japan: If Japan's Policy Remains Stubborn, Implementation Is Imminent; Prime Minister Chamberlain Answers Questions from Members of Parliament in the House of Commons; The Government Maintains Close Contact with France and the United States; Foreign Secretary Receives Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu to Explain the Situation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(London) This morning, the Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Chamberlain to discuss the situation in Tianjin. The committee also considered the Ministry of Commerce's report on economic retaliation measures against Japan. After the meeting, Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately met with Greenwood, a key member of the opposition Labour Party (Minor Attlee, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, is still ill). The discussion concerned the House of Commons agenda and was unrelated to the Tianjin incident. According to general opinion, the British government will continue its efforts through diplomatic channels to achieve a satisfactory local resolution to the Tianjin case. However, if the Japanese government insists on its views, the measures proposed by the British Ministry of Commerce will be implemented immediately. (Havas News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Today in the House of Commons, Prime Minister Chamberlain answered many questions from members of parliament regarding the situation in Tianjin. He stated that the British government is deeply aware of the repercussions that the current dispute in Tianjin will have on other British concessions and public concessions in China. Britain is currently maintaining close contact with France and the United States. The British government cannot but believe that the other governments also do not want to broaden the scope of discord or make the already difficult situation more complicated. Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax met with Japanese Ambassador to Britain Mamoru Shigemitsu today, and British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie is also attempting to clarify the situation to the Japanese government. The Prime Minister also stated that on June 15th, a group of Chinese and Korean agitators gathered outside the British concession in Tianjin. A detachment of the British Doughboy Light Infantry was ordered to assist the police of the British Municipal Council, but withdrew when the crowd was reduced to two hundred people. Obstacles remain outside the British concession in Tianjin. Britons entering and leaving the concession are subjected to strict searches in front of the obstacles, and several have been insulted. Perishable food transported into the concession is subject to strict inspection in front of the obstacles, which takes a long time, so it is still sometimes available and sometimes not. It is heard that the markets in the French concession are still receiving normal supplies of food. The British concession in Tianjin does not appear to have made special arrangements, but the British government is constantly inquiring about everything from the local authorities. On the morning of June 18th, two British merchant ships traveling to and from the coast passed through the Baihe River to Tianjin without being stopped or searched. In general, British ships, including tugs and barges, are currently being stopped and searched by the Japanese military authorities. The above two ships were exceptions. The British Consul-General in Tianjin has protested to the Japanese Consul-General, and Sir Robert Craigie has also been ordered to negotiate with the Japanese government. The overall situation is not yet clear. The Japanese original request for the extradition of the four suspects seems to have been confused by the larger issue of general policy. The British government has not yet received a formal letter from the Japanese government regarding this issue and still hopes that the issue can be resolved locally. After the Prime Minister announced that the British government is currently maintaining close contact with the governments of France and the United States, he said that he would of course continue to report everything to the House of Commons at the earliest possible opportunity. Labour MP Henderson asked whether the government's offer to resolve the issue of the extradition of the four suspects by an international advisory committee is still valid. The Prime Minister replied yes. Former Foreign Secretary Eden asked whether it could now be assumed from the Prime Minister's remarks that all those concerned about the Tianjin situation are fully aware that the British government is determined to ensure that the food needed by Britons in Tianjin is safely delivered. The Prime Minister replied yes, that we are currently studying this point and will take any necessary steps to ensure that they receive food supplies. Labour MP Noel-Baker asked whether the blockade of Gulangyu is still in place. The Prime Minister replied that he believed so. The Naval Under-Secretary Lu Weilin answered questions in the House of Commons regarding the British Navy near Tianjin and the depth of the Baihe River, stating that the largest ship that can sail up the Baihe River to Tianjin is the frigate HMS Lowestoft (990 tons). The ship is currently stationed in Tianjin, and other British ships are stationed in Dagu, 30 miles from Tianjin. This is the closest point to Tianjin that larger warships can reach. It is not currently considered valuable. All ships needed on the North China Sea surface can be transferred. Reports on the water depth of the Baihe River are received on a regular basis. (Reuters News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Tianjin incident, the Manchester Guardian reported this morning, "As of now, the Japanese side has shown no sign of being prepared to adopt a pacifying approach. Given the Japanese attitude, we really need to give full consideration to retaliatory measures." (Havas News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Sources close to the Foreign Office here recently stated that the hope of reaching a compromise solution to the Tianjin incident is extremely slim. The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss various preventive measures and economic retaliation measures. The former is intended to prevent incidents from occurring in Tianjin that could lead to dangerous conflicts. As for the latter, if the current dispute cannot be resolved amicably as a local incident within a few days, the following measures should be implemented sequentially: Abolish the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1911; Impose high import duties on Japanese goods entering British colonies; Restrict the amount of Japanese imports; Use special measures to deal with Japanese currency and step up assistance to Chinese legal tender. So far, the British government has not asked the United States for assistance to avoid the suspicion of coercing the United States, but it is expected that if Britain takes strong action, the United States will also participate. (Havas News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) Today, The Times reported that according to recent news from Tokyo, the Japanese government is now exploring opening a door for negotiations. The semi-official statement issued in Tokyo on Saturday and Sunday was much better worded than the declaration issued by the Japanese army in North China on June 13th. As for that declaration, it was intolerable to any self-respecting country. However, there is a passage in the semi-official statement that seems to distinguish British policy from the policies of other powers concerned in China. This should be clarified as to its meaning. As for saying that Japanese diplomacy has engaged in dealing with the overall situation, it is too early. If it has engaged, then the sooner the better, because Britain may not hesitate to take action to protect its Far Eastern interests. The Times concluded, "Public opinion demands too much." (Reuters News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Political circles here mostly believe that the Tianjin incident has forced Britain to shift its attention to the Far East, and said that if Britain takes action in the Far East, it will cause a serious crisis for Britain and is very appropriate during this period of alliance negotiations with the Soviet Union. According to the Japanese Embassy, there will soon be a "startling event" happening here, which may be a euphemism for Japan joining the German-Italian military alliance, but in fact, Germany is now gradually sympathizing with Japan.

<h3 id="e2">British and French Cabinets to Convene Meetings <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Although yesterday was a Sunday holiday, the crisis caused by the Japanese military blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin and the Japanese informal request for Britain to abandon the concession in Tianjin kept the diplomatic authorities of Britain and France in London and Paris active all day, with almost no time to rest. The British and French governments have in fact decided that they cannot sacrifice the concessions in response to Japanese demands, as this would endanger the overseas colonies of both countries. However, before the final policy is decided, the two cabinets must convene meetings to discuss the matter at length. According to authoritative sources, the French government has solemnly assured Britain that France will support any decision made by the British government to deal with Japan's threat to France's position in the Far East. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Japanese military blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, officials here recently stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain will make a statement in the House of Commons today, issuing a solemn warning to Japan. The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee will also meet before the meeting in the House of Commons to discuss the situation in Tianjin. If necessary, the entire Cabinet may hold a meeting, which is not impossible. (Havas News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the fact that the Tianjin blockade has lasted for five days, the tense atmosphere here is increasing. The British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to meet this morning to discuss the situation in Tianjin. Prime Minister Chamberlain may even convene a meeting of the entire Cabinet. In the afternoon, Chamberlain will answer questions from opposition party members in the House of Commons regarding the situation in Tianjin. Therefore, the focus of conversation today in Downing Street and Westminster (the location of the British House of Commons) is the Tianjin issue. (Haitong News Agency, 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">British Admiral Advocates a Strong Response <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(London) Today, Labour leader Greenwood and Admiral Keyes, former commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, delivered powerful speeches denouncing the Japanese blockade of the British concession in Tianjin. Keyes said that the Tianjin incident, coupled with the assistance given to Japan by Germany and Italy, is tantamount to a declaration of war on the British Empire. This provocation must be dealt with. He believes that if Britain stands firm and shows the world that it is prepared to join any struggle, making full use of all its wealth, industry, and manpower, it can win without a war. Greenwood said in the West Bromwich area that Japan is undoubtedly instigated by its European friends, intending to insult Britain and its own international obligations with a contemptuous attitude. We must make it clear to the dictatorships and militaristic countries in the East or the West that Britain and other civilized countries will not tolerate this organized attempt to overthrow the foundations of international law and impose control on the world by force. Peace is now in danger, not because of the wishes of the people of Germany, Italy, and Japan, but because of the ambitions of the rulers of the three countries. These ambitions must be curbed. Greenwood also criticized the government's policies, saying that they were the cause of the current threatening situation. (Reuters News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) British retired Admiral Keyes, one of Britain's leading naval authorities, has served as Chief of Staff of the British Admiralty and British Naval Minister. Today, he specifically warned the people in front of a three thousand anti-aircraft volunteer team, saying that the Japanese blockade of the British concession in Tianjin is tantamount to declaring war on Britain, and is supported by Germany and Italy. "After this, the dictator's second action will be a bolt from the blue, and no one can predict its arrival, so all our people must be fully organized and always prepared to meet the changes. The decision that the Tianjin incident has the support of Germany and Italy is in fact tantamount to a declaration of war on the British Empire. We must accept this challenge without hesitation. I firmly believe that if we have great determination, unshakable will, and show the world that Britain is prepared to fight, prepared to go with all its property, industry and manpower, we will definitely be able to win without a war. On the contrary, if we hesitate, not only will humiliation be imminent, but war will also be inevitable!" It is still hoped here that when Britain settles accounts with Japan, the United States can stand on Britain's side. According to telegraphs from the United States to various newspapers here, the strengthening of American public opinion's anti-Japanese attitude is now increasing with time. (Associated Press, 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">British Newspapers Warn the Government Not to Give In <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(London) The comments of British newspapers on the situation in Tianjin today are becoming more and more indignant, declaring that the people of the Tianjin concession are already on the verge of a food panic, and innocent citizens are subjected to strict questioning and rude harassment by Japanese police when entering and leaving the concession, even British girls are not spared. The Daily Telegraph declared that the simultaneous occurrence of the Gulangyu and Tianjin incidents proves that Japan clearly wants to drive the powers out of the concessions. Japan has decided not to respect China's open door policy and wants to monopolize Chinese trade, not with treaties, but with bayonets and threats to develop China's resources and manpower. The Daily Mail calls for Britain to take strong measures, even if it has to confront Japan alone, and warns the government that if London shows subservience to Japanese force in Tianjin, British power will suffer a major blow not only in the Far East, but also in the Middle East and even Europe. (Haitong News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph said today that there is more than one way to make the Japanese lose face, just as there is more than one way to impose economic retaliation on Japan to punish its improper pressure. However, at the same time, it is essential to prevent the residents trapped in the Tianjin concession from starving, so it is necessary to persuade the local Japanese to ease their blockade by diplomatic means, or to send British warships to transport food into Tianjin. The report also stated that both British and American people are involved in the Tianjin incident, and the arrival of Admiral Yarnell, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, may be a turning point for the crisis in the area. The report concluded that there is no reason to abandon the concession at this time. The imperialism of Western countries may have had some difficult price arguments with the Chinese, but Japanese imperialism has not had this experience at all, because "its purpose is to use the threat of bayonets rather than treaties to exploit China's resources and manpower.

<p>(Geneva) Since the Japanese blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, European democratic newspapers have unanimously condemned Japan's actions and urged their governments to take strong countermeasures. The position taken by Swiss newspapers is the same as that of Britain, France and other countries.</p>

<h3 id="e6">"Equivalent to a Declaration of War" <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Today is the seventh day of the Japanese army's blockade of the British concession in Tianjin. This newspaper has repeatedly commented on this. Britain has not yet made a firm and clear statement, and the arrogance of the Japanese army is getting higher and higher; the situation has deteriorated to the extreme. Although news from London says that the British government is preparing to implement the following measures in sequence: Abolish the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1911; Impose high import duties on Japanese goods entering British colonies; Restrict the amount of Japanese imports; Use special measures to deal with Japanese currency and step up assistance to Chinese legal tender. But it is still in the planning stage. We suspect that British Prime Minister Chamberlain still harbors some illusions and still hopes to resolve the Tianjin incident as a "local incident" and establish an "amicable" solution.</p>
<p>However, Japan not only does not accommodate Chamberlain's appeasement policy, but also intensifies its attack on Britain. Because Japan has seen through the weakness of the appeasement policy, Japan knows that the so-called "appeasement" line is to try to avoid direct conflict with the aggressor and seek compromise in everything, so it has no scruples about provoking Britain. First, the British-Soviet negotiations have recently been continuing. Japan is worried that the future anti-aggression front may include the Far East. The Tianjin incident is to try to strike Britain and threaten Chamberlain in order to undermine the anti-aggression front launched by Britain. Third, Japan's diplomatic offensive is concentrated on Britain, also implementing the joint strategy of the "anti-communist" group under Hitler's rule, and attacking Britain from both east and west. Italian newspapers openly declared: "The Tianjin incident today is the implementation of a great plan already drafted by the omnipotent country, aimed at destroying a part of the civilized country." According to Associated Press reports: "German observers unanimously believe that in the development of the Far East, there is a political triangular alliance between Germany, Japan and Italy." At the same time, according to the London Sunday News reported the day before yesterday, when the Tianjin issue is serious today, Hitler is preparing to make "startling demands," which further proves the connection between the eastern and western aggressors echoing each other. Fourth, the Japanese military has recently felt increasingly difficult in its military operations in China, and is sinking deeper and deeper. The hope of an aggressive victory is becoming more and more slim. Therefore, it is exerting pressure on third countries - especially Britain, in order to divert the attention of the Japanese people and attempt to cut off China's international assistance.</p>
<p>From the above points, it can be seen that the occurrence of the Tianjin incident is the beginning of a large-scale Japanese military attack on Britain. Recently, aggressors have constantly provoked Britain, such as landing on Gulangyu, inspecting British merchant ships, blockading the Chinese coast, instigating labor unrest, and injuring British expatriates, etc.; and Britain has endured it without strong countermeasures. Therefore, the blockade of the Tianjin British concession incident happened. If Britain does not resolve to stop this incident again, then Britain should be determined to withdraw from the Far East. British Mediterranean Fleet Commander General Keyes said it well: "Japan launched the Tianjin incident and received the support of Germany and Italy, which is equivalent to declaring war on the British Empire. This provocative action must be reported. If we can show the world that we are prepared to deal with it with all the wealth, industry, and manpower of the country, with a resolute and firm position, we can win without resorting to force. On the contrary, if we hesitate, we will be humiliated and war will be unavoidable!" We hope that Prime Minister Chamberlain has the great wisdom to accept such advice.</p>
<p>The French Tribune de Genève, one of Switzerland's important newspapers, recently published an editorial saying that Japan, after encountering the heroic resistance of China, turned to attack white countries. The League of Nations' proposal that countries individually assist China has taken effect. The Chinese legal tender supported by Western countries has become one of the most stable currencies in the world, while the Japanese yen has only false value. Japan has failed in Shanghai and Gulangyu, and is now attacking the Tianjin concession, its purpose is nothing more than to hinder the interests of Britain and France, and at the same time hope that the United States can maintain a detached attitude, but for the sake of restoring the balance of power in the Far East countries, the United States should actively intervene.

<p>(Chongqing) According to a TASS news agency report from New Delhi on the 19th, the "Pioneer Forum" editorial proposed that if Japan continues to blockade the concessions in Tianjin and Gulangyu, the United States should immediately sever diplomatic and commercial relations with it. The report strongly stated that regardless of the attitude of Britain and France, the United States must make a firm statement to Japan that the United States is unwilling to maintain friendly diplomatic and commercial relations with countries that launch aggressive wars and infringe on their rights.

<p>American Newspapers Say Japan Constitutes an Act of War</p>
<p>(New York) Regarding the Japanese military's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, news has been sent from Tokyo that the Japanese government fully agrees with the actions of the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin. The Republican New York People's Forum recently commented, "The Japanese military's blockade has already constituted an act of war. Whether the British side recognizes it or not, the fact is there and cannot be denied. Moreover, since this kind of behavior has already been seen in Gulangyu, and Shanghai is also being threatened, Tokyo officials are now making statements to the press, as if to say that Japan wants to maintain friendly relations with a certain country, but secretly supports the military in China to take war actions against it, and allows this state to continue to exist. It seems that the current problem is caused by the Japanese government. It is not something to be proud of that the American people have materially assisted the brutal and adventurous actions of the Japanese military in China, and they should stop it as soon as possible. Since the Japanese government is now mentally deranged and no different from its military, what is the use of wasting words diplomatically, talking about respecting treaties, guaranteeing rights, and protecting property?" (Havas News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Washington Evening Star editorial stated today that since the Japanese blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, American interests have also been hit hard. The intention of the Japanese is entirely to test the Western democracies' preparation and determination to oppose the "New Order in East Asia." As for why the damage suffered by the United States is the same as that of Britain and France, because the economic interests and status of all foreigners in China will take the outcome of this incident as a precedent. The degree to which the United States will support the strict measures that Britain will take against Japan is difficult to predict. Judging from the recent American public opinion surveys, most Americans advocate not only prohibiting the supply of military supplies to Japan, but also boycotting Japanese goods.

<p>(Tokyo) There has been speculation here about the meeting between U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Grew and Arita, Director of the American Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this morning. According to today's Yomiuri Shimbun and Nichinichi Shimbun, Grew informed Arita that if Washington obtains the consent of both Britain and Japan, it is prepared to mediate the dispute between the two countries in Tianjin. However, according to responsible sources, the two did not mention the Tianjin issue during their meeting, and it is heard that Grew and Arita did not exchange information on Tianjin, but only exchanged views on resolving various pending issues between Japan and the United States.

<p>(Washington) Regarding the incident in Tianjin, China, it has been rumored that Britain and France have contacted the United States government, intending to have the three countries strengthen their naval power in China.

<p>(Hong Kong) Foreign Dispatch: It is reported that the Japanese authorities have announced that the wire mesh around the British and French concessions will be electrified starting from 9:00 PM on the 19th. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) British Consul-General Jamieson met with Japanese Consul-General Tashiro this afternoon, pointing out the discrimination shown by the Japanese authorities in checking pedestrians and traffic, and demanded the same treatment for British citizens and other foreigners. Mr. Jamieson expressed dissatisfaction with the food shortage in the British concession and requested the Japanese side to ease the current restrictions on food. According to semi-official Japanese sources, the Japanese Consul-General rejected Mr. Jamieson's request, stating that the British authorities "refused to cooperate with the Japanese authorities to maintain peace and order in North China," hence the Japanese authorities took independent action. Therefore, the Japanese authorities will continue their current policy. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin British Concession authorities are currently facing various complex problems that need to be addressed. Recently, a subtle situation has arisen, causing serious concern. Many Chinese employees of the British Municipal Council, especially the families of the concession police, now reside outside the concession, in areas under Japanese administration in Tianjin. The administrative organs seem to have started investigating these families and have reportedly sent letters to employees of the concession Municipal Council, stating that if they do not resign from their positions, severe measures will be taken, including the execution of their family members. According to reliable sources, the wording of these letters and the way they were delivered indicate that the Japanese military police are behind this. The Chinese police of the British Municipal Council mostly have a long history of service and are known for their loyalty and discipline. Faced with this serious and genuine threat, they will inevitably feel fear. According to a semi-official Japanese statement released this afternoon, the Japanese military authorities have announced that the electric wires installed around the British and French concessions several months ago will be electrified starting at 8:00 PM tonight. Some observers believe that this announcement is meaningless because the Japanese side often electrified the wires without prior notice. Furthermore, according to a statement made by a Japanese military spokesperson today, it was implied that if Britain imposed economic pressure on Japan, the local Japanese authorities might consider that they had legitimate reasons to abandon their obligation to respect British interests in China. The spokesperson also stated that the Japanese government had repeatedly declared its policy of respecting the rights and interests of third countries in China. The Japanese forces fighting in the front lines have spared no sacrifice of significant strategic advantages to faithfully implement the policies announced by the government. The spokesperson also stated that the Japanese authorities will make some sacrifices to reduce the inconvenience that Americans, Germans, and other foreigners in Tianjin without concessions may feel as a result of the Japanese blockade of the concessions. It was also stated that the Japanese authorities have no intention of causing law-abiding Chinese who make a living in the British and French concessions to lose their jobs and are paying close attention to their current situation and assigning them duties. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Mr. Teibo, the Director-General of the British Concession Municipal Council in Tianjin, told a Reuters reporter today that he strongly denied the Japanese news reported in the local newspapers today, which stated that the British Municipal Council had prohibited the export of flour stored in the British Concession, claiming that this measure was a provocation to Japan. He claimed that the Municipal Council had not implemented such a ban this year and had never prevented or hindered those who wanted to transport supplies. To prove his words, Mr. Teibo presented available statistics, which showed that 10,000 bags of flour and 78 bags of rice were transported out of the concession on the first day of the blockade. Mr. Teibo also stated that 17,000 bags of flour and 950 bags of rice were transported out on the 15th of this month. On the 13th of this month, when it became known that the Japanese intended to implement a blockade, 91 bags of flour and 900 bags of rice were also moved out of the British Concession. Statistics after the 16th of this month have not yet been compiled, but the transportation of flour and rice is proceeding rapidly. If they find that it is delayed, it is not the fault of the Municipal Council; the Council has not imposed any restrictions on the transportation of flour and rice. Mr. Teibo relayed another aspect of the situation, stating that the Japanese side had repeatedly declared that it would not obstruct food from reaching the concession, but had not complied. Since the afternoon of the 16th of this month, Japanese motorboats have been patrolling the river, driving back civilian boats upstream loaded with vegetables and other food supplies entering the concession. These civilian boats are the main source of supplies for the concession. A small amount of food continues to enter the concession through obstacles, but the quantity is insufficient to meet the needs of foreigners and approximately 80,000 Chinese. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Although British Consul-General Jamieson recently lodged a serious protest against the harassment of British expatriates by search personnel, such incidents continue to occur. After the Jardine Matheson's ship "Xie Sheng" and the Swire's ship "Chengdu" successively arrived in Tianjin without being intercepted by the Japanese, the shipping situation has eased slightly. It is reported that the shipping companies have decided to telegraph their Shanghai offices to resume freight transport to Tianjin. It is reported that two British expatriates attempted to go to the racecourse last weekend and were subjected to humiliation. One was a man, whose clothes were completely stripped during the search, and the canned food he carried was all opened. The other was a woman, who was addressed by a Chinese policeman in extremely offensive language in Chinese. The woman, who understood Chinese well, was so mentally affected that she became dizzy. She was later assisted by some German expatriates to pass through the obstacles. Furthermore, Mrs. Doniley, a British citizen, and Mrs. Roger, an American citizen, ventured to the village club in the Japanese-controlled area yesterday due to the extreme heat, with the thermometer rising to 105 degrees. They had no difficulty leaving the concession, but were prevented from re-entering. They then walked more than two miles to another entrance before being allowed back into the concession. Mr. Smith, a British citizen, who was arrested by the Japanese on Saturday afternoon for arguing with a Chinese policeman, is still being detained by the Japanese despite repeated requests from the British Consul-General for his transfer.

The "Affaires Étrangères" newspaper of the Radical Socialist Party reported: "The objective of the Singapore conference is to agree on various military measures to be implemented when necessary. Moreover, the Singapore conference is not the only conference; in fact, similar conferences have been held in other places of the British and French empires, but they have not been widely publicized or exaggerated. In short, the defense of Britain and France has been fully established through consultation." The left-wing "Justice" newspaper reported: "European issues are closely related to Far Eastern issues. Cooperation between Britain and France in the Mediterranean is the best guarantee against Italian ambition. After improving relations with Poland and the Balkan Peninsula, the ambitions of Führer Hitler have been temporarily suppressed. If Britain and France can adopt a firm attitude in the Far East, it will also have a very positive impact." The right-wing "Le Figaro" newspaper stated that if sanctions were implemented at this time, their effectiveness would be greater than in 1935. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to Tokyo's "Kokumin Shimbun," Japanese officials and semi-official figures believe that the best solution to the existing tension between Britain and Japan is to return Hong Kong to China. The newspaper declared, "Since Japan implemented the blockade, the value of Hong Kong to Britain has been greatly reduced.

The Japanese government supports the attitude of the Japanese authorities in Xiamen. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Mr. Uchida, the Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen, and Rear Admiral Mito, Director of the Xiamen branch of the Asia Development Board, returned to Xiamen on Sunday. They came to Tokyo to discuss the Gulangyu incident with the government. It is reported that the Japanese government supports their position. According to a dispatch from Xiamen in a Japanese newspaper, the Japanese Consul-General and the foreign consuls are expected to reopen diplomatic negotiations soon. Due to the depreciation of the legal tender and the Japanese ban on ship traffic between Gulangyu and the mainland, prices on Gulangyu have soared, causing considerable hardship for Chinese residents. The Municipal Council authorities and the foreign consuls must understand this. Therefore, the negotiations will be related to the "reorganization" of the Gulangyu Public Concession Municipal Council. The dispatch also stated that, given the Japanese authorities' determination to maintain their position, it is necessary (1) to appoint a Japanese person as the General Manager and Chief of Police of the Municipal Council; (2) to have the Chairman of the Xiamen Maintenance Association appoint three Chinese to fill the three vacant positions on the Municipal Council Board of Directors; and (3) to clarify that Taiwanese residents have the right to vote and be elected.

<h3 id="e24">Several Difficult Points in the Tripartite Negotiations; British Government Considers Policy; Issue of Guaranteeing the Northwestern Border of the Soviet Union; Britain and France Provide Concise Plan; Chamberlain Reports on Negotiations in the House of Commons <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow. In addition to discussing the situation in Tianjin, China, it will also study how to intensify negotiations with the Soviet Union so that an agreement can be reached as soon as possible. According to news received by the British government, Germany is making every effort to keep the Soviet Union neutral, conducting business negotiations with the country and enticing it with a non-aggression pact. Britain has its own need to catch up quickly. The Soviet government submitted a new memorandum yesterday, which was forwarded to London by British Ambassador Sir Seeds. It will be submitted to the Foreign Affairs Committee for discussion tomorrow. The memorandum strongly argues that Britain and France should provide an unconditional and automatic guarantee for the northwestern border of the Soviet Union. Should the Soviet Union be directly or indirectly subjected to aggression in the future, Britain and France should automatically and unconditionally provide assistance. It is reported that the British government has exchanged views with the French government on this level and sent a new instruction by telegram to Ambassador Seeds tonight, putting forward a concise plan for the issue of guaranteeing the northwestern border of the Soviet Union. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) Newspapers here urge the government to accelerate the negotiations among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Liberal and Labor newspapers advocate that the government should fully accept Soviet demands to enhance Britain's political and military position in the Far East, believing that as long as Britain and the Soviet Union are united, it will be enough to stop Japan, as Japan would never dare to wage war against Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States. (Haitong, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain reported on the progress of the tripartite negotiations among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, stating that there was a possibility of raising certain issues during the negotiations that needed to be considered, but so far, none had been heard. Conservative MP Adams then asked if there were any other difficulties in the current negotiations besides the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic coastal countries. The Prime Minister immediately replied "Yes." There are several other difficulties at this time. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>(London) Under-Secretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons today in response to questions about Bohemia and Moravia that the government has instructed Ambassador Henderson to Germany to contact the German government to establish a consulate general in Prague. The government recognizes that this step implies de facto recognition of the current situation in Bohemia and Moravia, but it does not involve any change in the government's opinion on this issue. The government consulted with other relevant governments, such as France, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Poland, before making this decision. Labor MP Fletcher spoke, saying that this move is tantamount to recognizing the legality of Germany's annexation. Butler replied that this was not the case. The government has declared that they do not recognize any legal basis for this annexation. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Office official Butler declared in the House of Commons this afternoon that the British government plans to send a consul general to Prague and has requested a letter of accreditation from the German government, as Britain now needs to send a consul to the city to issue passports to refugees who want to seek refuge in Britain. This matter is sufficient to raise the issue of de facto recognition of the current situation in Bohemia and Moravia, which the government is aware of, but the government's views on this issue have not changed. Before making the decision, the government contacted other relevant countries, namely the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland. He then replied to an inquiry from opposition Labor MP Fletcher, stating that the annexation of Bohemia has no legal basis as far as the British government is concerned. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>(Paris) According to a dispatch from the "Le Petit Parisien" correspondent in the Greek capital, Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu and Greek authorities held talks in a very harmonious atmosphere. It is understood that the issue of Bulgaria joining the Balkan Entente has been thoroughly discussed, and the attitudes of the Balkan Entente countries towards Bulgaria have also become consistent.

Foreign countries are constantly talking about the minority ethnic groups in Romania, but they never mention the Romanian minority ethnic groups in their own countries, which is not a way to promote peace.

<p>(London) An air defense exercise was held in the "Chelsea" district of London this morning. The atmosphere was realistic and grand. Home Secretary Sir Hoare, Lord Privy Seal and Director of Air Defense Affairs Sir Anderson, and 200 observers from the department all participated in the exercise. There were 7,000 participants in the exercise, and 5,000 elementary school students participated in the evacuation drill. Starting at 9:00 a.m., the participants were divided into several teams, carrying food and various equipment, and took refuge in subway stations. Immediately, a preliminary alarm was issued, and all vehicles on the street stopped for fifteen minutes, while pedestrians rushed to shelters. In streets without shelter facilities, circles were drawn on the ground and surrounded by ropes. At 0:30 p.m., the siren sounded loudly, reporting that "enemy planes" were approaching. In an instant, traffic on "King's Road" (one of the most prosperous streets) came to a complete standstill. Only a few curious people refused to go to the shelters and stood on the street to watch the exercise. Afterwards, Sir Anderson said that the Air Defense Affairs Office had organized the exercise very well, and the people had also observed discipline, which was satisfactory. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The Hong Kong naval authorities issued a statement yesterday, stating, "Britain and France have closely cooperated in Europe. Due to this relationship, the Far East military authorities have specially invited Lieutenant General D'Arco, commander of the French Far East Fleet, and Lieutenant General Martin, commander-in-chief of the French Far East Army, to visit Singapore at the end of this month to review Singapore's defense facilities."</p>
<p>Britain and France Strengthen Far East Defense</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the result of the aggression of Germany and Italy, the two major democratic countries, Britain and France, have become increasingly united. In the past few months, the cooperation between Britain and France in Europe has reached a very close stage, and their painstaking efforts to establish a world peace front to confront aggressive countries are also universally recognized. In the Far East, the cooperation between Britain and France has also continued to show factual performance. For example, on the issue of the concessions in Shanghai, Gulangyu, Tianjin, etc., Britain and France are completely consistent. Recently, such events as the visit of the commander of the British Navy in China to Vietnam and the visit of the commander of the French Navy to Hong Kong, and the mutual visits of the naval fleets of the two countries are all well-known.</p>
<p>France Also Participates in Singapore Conference</p>
<p>The British Far East military authorities recently convened a military conference in Singapore, inviting the French Far East military authorities to participate. Singapore newspapers already reported this as early as a month ago, and the English-language Straits Times also wrote an article emphasizing the importance of the conference, but at that time, the Singapore authorities believed that the time was not ripe, so it was not published. Now, Naval Commander Noble of British China has decided to take the flagship Kent to Singapore last Friday to participate in the military conference before returning to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>More Than One Hundred Japanese Soldiers Killed or Wounded; Much Grain and Equipment Lost</p>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: At 3:00 p.m. on the 11th of this month, two to three hundred Japanese soldiers, divided among eleven civilian boats, towed by a steamship, set out from Wuxi towards Heqiao. The boats were loaded with bullets and food. When they passed Daixi Bridge, they were discovered by the Jiangnan Advance Army, which, together with the regular army ×× Division, ambushed on the shore and attacked with machine guns. The Japanese army was caught off guard and suffered more than one hundred casualties. Four civilian boats were sunk, and fewer than half of those who swam to escape survived. A great deal of bullets and food were lost.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Anti-Japanese Organizations Secretly Formed by People of Nantong <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Retreat to Yaogang from Tongcheng</p>
<p>Nantong Correspondence: The Japanese troops who invaded Shigang and fled back to Nantong suffered heavy casualties. After their disastrous defeat, they built two earthworks in Gujiaqiao, Sacrifice Altar, North Suburb, to prevent attacks by the Chinese army. In recent days, they have been practicing target shooting to demonstrate their power and have ordered the puppet police to force civilians outside the southwest gates to serve, pretending that they are planning to invade Shigang again. However, there are recently patriotic volunteers in Nantong who have secretly formed anti-Japanese organizations, constantly agitating the Japanese and puppet troops to oppose the war and turn against the Japanese, and distributing anti-Japanese leaflets. This was discovered by the Japanese and puppet military authorities a few days ago. To prevent this, they specially dispatched more than twenty puppet detectives, who were scattered in various streets and alleys to secretly investigate. If there were any suspicious persons, they would be inspected or arrested immediately.</p>
<p>Also, because a large number of Hua troops were sent to northern Jiangsu, the five hundred or so Japanese troops stationed in Tongcheng were extremely frightened that they would besiege Tongcheng. Therefore, they suddenly retreated to Yaogang the day before yesterday. Another hundred or so cavalrymen went east from Longwang Temple. There were three or four puppet soldiers at the East Gate drawbridge to Banqiao, and there were rest stations at the West Gate drawbridge, with two Japanese and puppet soldiers stationed there, carrying two rifles each. Because so many Japanese and puppet troops in the city have been sent to the front line, the city is empty and extremely panicked. They are now drawing Japanese troops back to the city from various towns to prevent Hua army attacks.</p>
<p>A few days ago, eight traitors in Tongcheng, each carrying a handgun in four rickshaws, went from Dingjia Store to Henggang, where they stayed at a tea shop under the bridge for a moment and investigated whether there were any Hua troops, before returning to Dingjia Store. The traitors were all dressed in civilian clothes and wearing straw hats. At present, the Japanese troops in Tangzha and the city often use traitors to guide patrols and wantonly search, plunder, kill, and burn in the countryside. For example, Qinzhao You and Chenjiazhai were both ravaged a few days ago.</p>
<h3 id="e33">A Perspective on the Situation of the Japanese Army in Xiamen: The Attack on Fujian is Only a "Bombing by the Air Force"; A Small Garrison is Deployed with Large Guns <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Since the Jinmen-Xiamen Japanese army was raided by the Jinmen Chinese Soil Restoration and Save the Homeland Corps on the night of April 20, they have been extremely terrified. The Commander of the Xiamen Japanese Army, Miyata, has actively requested assistance from Tokyo, and at the same time suggested bombing Fujian cities to intimidate them. Coincidentally, at the end of April, the Japanese General Staff, due to the setbacks in the battles on Hainan Island and Guangdong Province, transferred troops stationed in Japan and Taiwan, and combined two divisions, concentrated in Taiwan, and the Xiamen Japanese army took the opportunity to create a false impression, saying that they would launch a major attack on Fujian. The Japanese Third Fleet also returned to Jinmen and Xiamen in rotation to rest after failing to invade Guangdong. At the same time, the Japanese General Staff's plan for a "rapid offensive in May" could not be realized due to insufficient troops, so it was decided to replace the "ground offensive" with "air force bombing." As a result, the seaplanes carried by the Japanese warships anchored in the Jinmen-Xiamen waters were dispatched every day to frantically bomb Fuzhou, Putian, Quanzhou, Tong'an, Longxi, Haicheng, Zhangpu, Yunxiao, Dongshan, Yong'an, Nanping, Changting, Longyan, Nanjing, Yongchun, and other places. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices by the people, the Chinese authorities specially ordered the evacuation of the people, and used this to facilitate the military's anti-Japanese resistance. As for the situation of the Japanese army in Xiamen, according to various investigations, it is briefly recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Important Organizations</p>
<p>There are four important organizations of the Xiamen Japanese Army: (1) the Xiamen Base Headquarters for military affairs, commanded by Rear Admiral Miyata Yoshiichi; (2) the Xingya Institute Xiamen Liaison Department for special affairs, headed by Rear Admiral Mito Haruzo; (3) the Xiamen Army Agency, also for special affairs, headed by Lieutenant Colonel Sawamura; (4) the Xiamen Consulate General for diplomatic affairs, Consul General Uchida Goro. However, the various organizations have different systems and are engaged in fierce infighting. The power of military command was originally in the hands of Miyata, but Mito interfered everywhere because he was the head of the Xingya Institute stationed in Xiamen. Sawamura, with the support of the military, refused to show weakness and competed for power at any time. Uchida, although a diplomatic envoy, was actually a puppet of Miyata and Mito. He was very unwilling, so their infighting was very fierce.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Stationed in Xiamen</p>
<p>The Japanese troops stationed in Xiamen are currently the Horiuchi unit of the Yokosuka Corps, commanded by Nakasaka, with a number of 620, mostly new soldiers from poor farmers, with weak awareness and lack of strict training. They were once transferred to Hainan Island to reinforce, but because of their weak combat power, they were transferred to Xiamen to garrison. In addition to daily training, they also conduct street fighting and defense war exercises. Their garrison area focuses on Wutong, Zhongzhai, Gaoqi, Dianqian, Hezhou, Meitoushan, and Bengpingwei in Hushan, to prevent the Chinese army from counterattacking. As for the important intersections in the urban area and the various embankments and docks, sentries are distributed day and night, and they are allowed to increase the number of double or quadruple posts towards Gulangyu to prevent Chinese youths from sneaking in. In addition, four patrol teams are formed to patrol the entire city at night, indiscriminately arresting the people and accusing them of suspicion, torturing and killing them cruelly. Therefore, after nightfall, except for Taiwanese traitors, no one dares to go out easily. In addition, most of the heavy weapons that the Japanese army had set up at various important points in Xiamen have been moved to Guangdong to reinforce after the tense situation in the Guangdong War. At present, there is only one mobile gun carriage, which travels to and from various important places (such as Gaoqi, Wutong, Meirengong,) and bombards Aotou, Jimei in the direction of Tong'an in Hua, and Xinyang and Haicang in Haicheng. In addition, there are several forged wooden cannons, which are deployed on the mountains of Bengpingwei, Niujiacun, etc.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Stationed in Xiamen</p>
<p>The Japanese warships stationed in Xiamen are uncertain, sometimes three or five, sometimes one or two, and at most a dozen or so. Among them, many are transport ships. Only one or two destroyers and a few small boats are usually stationed in Xiamen. These small boats are specially for harassing the coasts of Tong'an and Haicheng, each capable of holding twenty or thirty people, with two machine guns installed.</p>
<p>Bombs Shipped to Xiamen</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Xiamen is weak in strength. In order to prevent the worst, the Tokyo General Staff ordered the Xiamen Japanese army authorities to order a determined defense, and allocated 120 oval bombs from the Taiwan arsenal. The bombs were shipped to Xiamen by the Lushan Maru a few days ago for application. Each of these bombs weighs 130 pounds. In order to prevent the Chinese army from counterattacking, the Japanese army in Xiamen has begun to step up the ambush of the bombs in the city's key intersections and key points in Hushan, connecting them with electric wires, and preparing to pass current through them when the Chinese army counterattacks to make them explode. Its embarrassing situation can be seen in its class.</p>

<p>Sabotage Work at Dasheng Cotton Mill</p>
<p>Nantong Correspondence: Japanese Staff Officer Okamoto, accompanied by Lu Rongpeng from Haimen, landed at Tianshengang from a warship the day before yesterday and inspected Tongcheng. He stayed at the Chonghai Hotel and visited Lang Mountain, planning to build cannon emplacements, intending to stay for a long time. In addition, the Dasheng Cotton Mill, which was taken over and put into operation by the Japanese, has more than a thousand male and female workers. The female foreman Chen Qiaoyun was shot and killed the night before last, and several power poles were damaged, cutting off the current. It was difficult for Dasheng to start work. Later, Japanese troops arrived from Tangzha Tianshengang and were stationed in the Wufuqiao area to repair the wires. Dasheng started work again immediately. Due to the reduction of workers, more than 300 workers were recruited in Shanghai and brought to the factory by the Nantong Maru to work.</p>

<p>Many Casualties on Both Sides</p>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Xietang Town outside Fengmen Gate in this county is located near the key river port of Yiqi, making it a strategically important location. Therefore, the Japanese side has dispatched a large number of puppet troops to guard the town. At around 9:00 p.m. on the 16th of this month, dozens of Japanese soldiers, divided among three civilian boats, towed by a motorboat, passed through Shazha Village, three miles from the town. Because they were lost, they abandoned the boat and landed, intending to capture villagers to lead the way. At that time, the villagers in the village thought that bandits were looting the village, so they fled the village one after another, causing the anger of the Japanese soldiers, who immediately opened fire. The sound of gunfire was dense, and the nearby farmers were awakened. The puppet troops stationed in Xietang Town mistakenly believed that it was a night attack by the Chinese army and were on alert everywhere. Later, after receiving reports from the villagers in Shazha Village that bandits were looting, the puppet troops boldly moved towards the village. At the same time, the Japanese troops also mistakenly believed that the puppet troops were the Chinese army, and also dispersed their troops and changed to shooting at the puppet troops. Because it was late at night, neither side knew the details, and the fierce battle lasted for three hours. The Japanese army was later assisted by the guards stationed in Jiaozhi Town and finally defeated the puppet troops. It was not until the next morning that the retreating puppet troops also asked the Jiaozhi guard for help before they realized that it was a living drama of mutual killing between the Japanese and puppet troops. After the incident, the casualties on both sides were checked, and many were killed or injured.</p>

<p>Change of Puppet Police Chief Suzhou Correspondence: Since Feng Xinzhi of the "Great People's Association" was assassinated, Yao Xuan, the confidential secretary of the Puppet Provincial Government's Civil Affairs Department, committed suicide by bullet. The assassins were nowhere to be found and could not be arrested. The Japanese side was greatly dissatisfied with Cheng Pingruo, the police chief of the puppet provincial capital. Cheng knew that it was difficult to hold on to his position, and at the same time, because his private purse was full, he quietly resigned. The successor was Dong Youxian, the owner of the Penglai World in Laolumen, who was recommended by the Japanese side. Dong was originally a figure in the "Anqing Gang" and in recent years has had the status of a "small tycoon" in the area of Laolumen. The Japanese side took advantage of him to summon vagrants and use them for their dispatch. Since Dong's arrival, he has wanted to place his private people and has been fault-finding with the old officials who served under Cheng. As a result, they resigned to show their non-cooperation. This was heard by Abe Taro, the Japanese instructor, who severely rebuked both sides at the inauguration ceremony of the puppet's new director, with stern words and expressions. As a result, both sides reluctantly coexisted for a while.</p>

<p>The Puppet Maintenance Association Chairman of Pingyao Captured; Moganshan Bombed, Affecting Foreigners</p>
<p>Deqing Correspondence: The Jiangnan Advance Team's X Corps, under the command of General Commander Qiu Yulin, launched a two-pronged attack on Wukang on the 15th of this month, starting from Pai Tou and Jiu Du. The Japanese troops in Wukang scattered and fled at the time, leading to their capture and killing by civilian militia armed with shotguns. Farmers in Wangtang were particularly brave, as the Japanese army had previously massacred farmers in Wangtang, so the farmers rose up to take revenge. After the Chinese army charged into Wukang, they emptied the Japanese army's armory of all stored guns and ammunition. The Yu-Wu Highway connecting Yuhang to Wukang was completely destroyed by the Chinese army for a thirty-mile stretch from Wukang to Chou Shan.</p>
<p>Pingyao and Huanghe, forty miles away, were also recovered by the Chinese army. At the same time, Fang Zhongsheng, the chairman of the puppet maintenance association of Pingyao, was captured by the Chinese army and will be handed over to the public for open interrogation.</p>
<p>Moganshan was designated as a neutral zone when the war broke out and had not been bombed. However, from the 7th of last month until the day before Wukang County was recovered, it was bombed twice by Japanese planes. Foreign residences, refugee shelters on the mountain, and the Shanghai Municipal Council Sanatorium were also affected. The sanatorium was almost leveled to the ground. Some Chinese were slightly injured. The director of the shelter, Nuo Wu, has asked the consular corps in Hangzhou to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese consul in Hangzhou, demanding compensation for the damage.</p>

<p>To Protect Highways and Bridges</p>
<p>Kunshan Correspondence: The leader of the Japanese pacification team, Nagakawa, finding that guerrillas appeared and disappeared unpredictably within the county, often destroying railway tracks and highway bridges, making defense difficult, hosted a lavish banquet with over fifty tables last month, inviting all the township and village chiefs in the county. Ostensibly, this was to strengthen relationships and express goodwill, but in reality, it was to order the township and village chiefs to pay attention to the guerrillas' movements and to take responsibility for protecting highways and bridges. It is reported that the puppet county magistrate and all the puppet district chiefs attended as guests of honor. The generally ignorant township and village chiefs were flattered and willingly exploited. Therefore, the protection of railways and highways has now been clearly divided: the railways are the responsibility of the Japanese army, while the highways are the responsibility of the township and village chiefs.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Jiangsu Province's Post-War Education Funding Situation: Provincial Education Revenue Only 40% of Pre-War Levels; Education Department Plans to Reorganize Revenue and Economize Expenditure <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(Taixian Correspondence) Since August 13th, most areas of Jiangsu Province have fallen, resulting in a large reduction in education revenue, making it difficult to sustain operations. However, the Education Department has planned to increase funding and reduce expenditures. The details of the department's financial situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Provincial Education Funding</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province's education funding was originally very abundant. The provincial education expenditure budget for the 26th year (1937) included 346,744 yuan for education administration expenses, 436,808 yuan for higher education expenses, 3,174,313 yuan for general education expenses, 471,060 yuan for social education expenses, 100,000 yuan for overseas study expenses, 153,600 yuan for subsidies, 750,000 yuan for promoting compulsory education, 713,290 yuan for various temporary expenses, and 256,000 yuan for debt repayment, totaling 6,401,815 yuan. This can be considered a considerable sum. However, after the 27th year (1938), most counties in Jiangnan fell, and northern Jiangsu was also a war zone. The province's education funding fell into extreme difficulty. In the first half of the 27th year, the provincial education special fund revenue, calculated from 31 counties, was only 40%, totaling no more than 347,661 yuan. Under the expenditure items for the 27th year, excluding education administration expenses, the first half of the year was 268,144 yuan and the second half was 98,416 yuan. The budget for the 28th year (1939) was also unable to increase, and the situation of its exhaustion can easily be imagined. This must rely on subsidies from the central government.</p>
<p>County Education Funding</p>
<p>As for county education funding, the total budget for county education funding in the 26th year was 11,220,861 yuan. Although the administrative expenses of the county education bureaus were disbursed at 80% of the original amount due to the tense war situation in October of the 26th year, the general education and social education expenses were still disbursed according to the old practice, without any reduction. In the spring of the 27th year, the general education and social education expenses of the counties were still disbursed according to the original budget. If the local finances were difficult, the disbursement would be reduced at the discretion of the situation. Regarding the administrative expenses of the county education bureaus, a separate budget was compiled for the second half of the 27th year. The county education expenses budget was recompiled and tightened once in the 27th year, totaling two tight budgets.</p>
<p>Reorganization Plan</p>
<p>The Provincial Education Department, considering that education funding is so exhausted, and in the current process of protracted resistance, believes that only by striving for a balance between income and expenditure and self-sufficiency can it overcome these issues. It has already made comprehensive plans, giving priority to frugality in terms of expenditure and resolving to reorganize revenue. Regarding frugality, it aims to ensure that the provincial and county education expenditure budgets are aligned, strictly tighten the provincial and county education expenditure budgets, determine the principles for education expenditure in the occupied areas, and restrict new projects and construction. Regarding the reorganization of revenue, measures such as clearing up school property, rectifying school rents, determining the standards for education expenditure collection, and clearing up the financial property of provincial and county education institutions are all aimed at seeking remedies under the goal of balancing income and expenditure and self-sufficiency, so as to avoid the crisis of depletion of education funding in the future.</p>

<p>(Princeton, USA, 17th Reuters) In the battle for the world mile throne, in tonight's "Mile Run of the Century", Guttmann, the bespectacled Englishman who holds the world record, finished fourth. All four American athletes were ahead of Guttmann. Fanzeki won the championship. Fang is a ten-university mile champion. Cunningham was second. Ke is the holder of the world indoor mile record, and Romani was third, and Leteo was fourth, and Guttmann was fifth, with a mediocre result of four minutes and eleven seconds. Although no world record was produced, the competition was extremely thrilling. Tonight's audience reached more than 30,000 people, vying to see whether the world mile throne belongs to Cunningham or Guttmann.</p>
<p>Guttmann's speed suddenly decreased in the last 220 yards, his steps were disordered, and he almost fell. According to Guttmann, when Leteo surpassed Guttmann in the last 220 yards, Leteo violently collided. At the start of the draw, Romani was in the innermost circle, Cunningham was second, then Guttmann Fanzeki, and Leteo was in the outermost circle. Guttmann took the lead and was in the front row. For the first two laps, he was in the lead all the way. At the half-mile mark, he was almost overtaken by Fanzeki. At three-quarters of a mile, Wood was six inches ahead of Fang and Cunningham. On the last lap, Fanzeki suddenly released his speed and surpassed Guttmann, sprinting to the finish line. In the last 220 yards, Guttmann was chased out by Leteo, and his speed suddenly slowed down and fell behind, almost falling. The crowd was greatly surprised. After the game, Leo went to apologize to Guttmann. The ink movement was full of people. Before the game, the bet was that Guttmann would win three to one, and the creation of a new world record would be seven to four. Guttmann had high hopes before leaving England for the United States to compete, but the result was unexpected. Fanzeki's record of four minutes and eleven seconds is more than four seconds behind Guttmann's record of four minutes and six seconds and four seconds.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Telegram Regarding Suspension of Principal and Interest Payments on Securities Causes Public Bonds to Plummet Three to Four Yuan; Foreign Stock Market Abnormally Quiet <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>In the informal securities market, due to the Ministry of Finance spokesperson stating that the Central Government will not pay the principal and interest on domestic public bonds secured by customs revenue, except for the Rehabilitation Bonds, which will still hold the seventh lottery draw on July 31st. These interest coupons can be used as collateral for bank payments. It is rumored that the total principal and interest payable on July 31st is 56.6 million yuan. Some say that to prevent large sums of legal tender from flowing into the occupied areas, payments will be made in Chongqing, while in Shanghai, remittance permits will be issued. This news arrived after the morning closing of public bonds, so the market fell in the afternoon. The former statement said that all principal and interest payments would be suspended, while the latter only changed the payment method to remittance. No further news was heard by the afternoon closing, but the downward trend in the market was equal to the volatility of January 16th. The market was beyond control, with prices plummeting, and the difference between the morning and afternoon was about four yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding the bond market, the opening at the beginning of the afternoon was slightly lower than Saturday by a few cents. After buyers raised prices, the result was only a small increase of five to twelve cents. Transactions were extremely active. Tian Sheng, Qia Feng, Tong Yu, and Hong Da were buying very aggressively. The sellers were mostly at 35 yuan and Lian He. Others such as Xing Yuan, Tong Kang, and Xie Xing also sold. The market was stable. After the closing, a sudden and drastic change occurred in the informal market. Category C bonds broke through the 50 yuan mark. The market opened at 2:00 PM, and the prices were almost the same as the informal market. However, outside of 50 yuan, the market continued to rise due to the efforts of Qia Feng, Da Tong, Xie Da, and No. 20, reaching as high as 52 yuan. Later, due to No. 49, Xing Yuan, and various retail investors selling at the market price, the market price could not stabilize and fell to the 50 yuan level. The closing price was 50 yuan and 0.25 cents. After the closing, no one was accepting 50 yuan. As a result, the market price fell by 3.10 to 4.35 yuan. The total transaction volume was more than 3 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category　Highest　Lowest　Closing Price　Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Category A　62.95　60.00　60.05　Down 3.85</p>
<p>Category B　55.50　51.00　51.00　Down 4.35</p>
<p>Category C　53.90　50.00　50.25　Down 3.50</p>

<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market experienced another extraordinary change, remaining in extreme chaos throughout the day. Generally, the situation was characterized by a sharp decline followed by a surge. Initially, due to the rumor circulating in the market last weekend that HSBC would stop supplying gold yesterday, which has now been proven to be completely unfounded, people lost confidence, and buyers hesitated. The morning opening plummeted to 2,620 yuan. Subsequently, due to news that the spot foreign exchange market was stable, but the futures market tightened sharply, buying interest was rekindled. Silver shops actively absorbed gold on behalf of customers. Moreover, rumors suddenly spread in the market that the Ministry of Finance would temporarily postpone interest payments on all bonds guaranteed by customs revenue, further fueling buying interest. Wealthy individuals sold public bonds and shifted to buying gold, causing a rapid surge, closing at the day's highest peak of 2,700 yuan, almost breaking the previous weekend's high of 2,702.5 yuan. As a result, the market reversed and rose by 20 yuan. Although there were many twists and turns along the way, there were no major waves. Trading was brisk, reaching about 2,000 taels. Silver jewelry also rose and then fell, eventually increasing by 3 yuan. Customs gold remained stable, while Central Bank gold and English pure gold both declined.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Reverses and Rises by Twenty Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each tael (ten liang) initially opened at 2,6670 yuan due to the rumor circulating last Saturday afternoon that HSBC would stop supplying gold today. This has now been proven to be completely false, causing people to lose confidence. Sellers initially called out 2,6670 yuan, but because there were no takers, the price gradually dropped by more than 40 yuan before any transactions occurred. The market opened at 9:30 AM, falling as low as 60 yuan. Initially, a certain gold firm bought 50 taels from its peers at a price of 2,620 yuan. Subsequently, due to news that the spot foreign exchange market was stable, but the futures market was soft, buying interest was sparked, and silver shops actively absorbed gold. Soon after, a certain gold firm sold 50 taels back to the silver shops at a price of 2,625 yuan. Following that, a certain money exchange firm sold 50 taels to the silver shops, and a gold firm sold 100 taels, at a price of 2,630 yuan. Later, the price was raised by 5 yuan, and the silver shops bought 50 taels from a certain gold firm at a price of 2,635 yuan. In an instant, the price was raised by another 7 yuan, and the silver shops bought 50 taels from a certain silver firm at a price of 2,642 yuan. Then, the silver shops bought 50 taels from a money exchange firm, at the same price. Later, the silver shops bought 50 taels from a gold firm at a price of 2,645 yuan. As the supply became scarcer, the upward trend intensified, jumping by more than 10 yuan. The silver shops bought 50 taels from a gold firm at a price of 2,658 yuan. Then, it soared by another 12 yuan, and the silver shops bought 20 taels from a gold firm at a price of 2,670 yuan. At that time, buying momentum weakened slightly, and the price briefly fell back. The gold firm sold 50 taels to the silver shops at a price of 2,662 yuan. Soon after, due to a sudden interest in trading from the money exchange firms, the price rose again. The money exchange firms absorbed 50 taels each from the silver shops and securities firms, both at a price of 2,672 yuan. Later, because the securities firms continued to sell, and the money exchange firms stopped buying and started selling, the price fell back immediately. The securities firms sold 50 taels to the silver shops at a price of 2,666 yuan. The gold firm sold 50 taels to a certain silver firm at a price of 2,665 yuan. Then, it fell sharply by 10 yuan, and the money exchange firms traded 50 taels with each other at a price of 2,655 yuan. Near noon, the money exchange firms sold 150 taels to the silver shops, all at 2,660 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning. In the afternoon, due to a sudden rumor in the market that the Ministry of Finance would temporarily postpone interest payments on all securities guaranteed by customs revenue, buying interest surged again. The market opened at 2:15 PM, and the price immediately rose by 20 yuan. The money exchange firms bought 50 taels from a gold firm at a price of 2,680 yuan. Subsequently, the money exchange firms and a certain gold firm aggressively entered the market, selling more than 200 taels, causing the price to gradually fall to 2,665 yuan. Later, the securities firms suddenly came to absorb gold aggressively, and a certain silver shop was willing to buy on behalf of customers, so the price rose sharply again by 35 yuan. A certain silver shop bought 50 taels each from a money exchange firm and a certain broker, both at 2,700 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening. As a result, the market reversed and rose by 20 yuan compared to last weekend. It is noted that the price has risen rapidly for three days, totaling 115 yuan. (It is heard that after the closing, a certain silver shop absorbed another 50 taels from a certain broker at a price of 2,697 yuan.) The total price difference for the day was 80 yuan. The quoted price of spot gold for cash firms is 10 yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the spot gold bidding price is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. It is said that few transactions are made.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Reverses and Rises by Three Yuan</p>
<p>For silver jewelry sold by the tael, the opening price for Da Tong Hang was still 270 yuan. At 9:38 AM, due to the spot gold market plummeting by 60 yuan, the price was also lowered by 4 yuan. By 10:30 AM, because the spot gold market recovered, the price also rose by 3 yuan. At 3:50 PM, the price increased by another 3 yuan. Later, at 4:35 PM in the evening, the price increased by another 1 yuan, resulting in a net increase of 3 yuan. Da Tong Hang changed its quote to 273 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang also changed its quote to 271 yuan, with a buying price of 265 yuan.</p>
<p>Silver is Exchanged at Two Yuan and Eight Jiao</p>
<p>The silver price of silver shops, sold by the tael, Da Tong Hang was originally at 2.5 yuan. Now, since gold has soared, silver has also risen accordingly. As reported by this newspaper yesterday, in order to maintain costs, it was decided by public meeting to uniformly increase the price by 0.3 yuan at 10:30 AM. The exchange price for Da Tong Hang is 2.8 yuan per tael, and for Xin Tong Hang, it is 2.7 yuan.</p>
<p>Central Bank Gold Also Falls</p>
<p>The Central Bank's buying price of Chinese cash gold fell back to 1,212.3 yuan. The listed price of customs gold remained stable at 2.0396 yuan. The Shanghai Standard Gold price also fell by 0.3 yuan to 1,207.6 yuan, which was due to the London telegram on the 17th that the price of British pure gold had decreased by 0.5 pence per ounce.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Foreign Exchange Futures Tighten Further; This Month's Discounted Interest is About Five Cents; Next Month's Opening Gap is Around Two-Five <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Since the afternoon of last Saturday, rumors have spread in the cash market that the foreign exchange market is expected to decline, and that HSBC Bank will no longer maintain the rate of 6.5 pence for British gold. All major foreign firms are panicking and preparing to close out their positions in large quantities. Therefore, a rush to close positions was triggered at the opening yesterday morning. However, when HSBC's listed rate was announced, there was no change, and they were still willing to supply at the original price. Other foreign banks also had very strong selling intentions, so the rush to close positions quickly subsided, and the spot market saw no change. Because the supply of silver has been tightening recently, those without cash have been turning to the futures market. In addition, banks' selling intentions are very weak, but their appetite is good, and they are offering more swaps. As a result, the market has tightened sharply. The spot market closed late in the afternoon, with this month's discounted interest rate for British gold at 1.25 and for US dollars at 2.5, which is about 5.5 cents per month (excluding commissions). The discounted interest rate for British gold from this month to July is 2.1875 and for US dollars is 3.75, which is about 3.1 cents per month (excluding commissions). The above are all interbank rates, and the actual monthly interest rate (excluding commissions) for arbitrageurs to swap spot goods for this month (calculated for eleven days) is about 4 cents. For June to July, the monthly interest rate is about 2.78 cents. However, Chinese merchants are not very enthusiastic about discounted arbitrage. It is said that there are two reasons: firstly, the supply of silver is tight and there is a shortage of cash; secondly, there may be major changes in the European situation and the financial market, making delivery difficult when due. There are too many people closing out distant months, so the banks' buying and selling prices have also widened sharply. The actual price for July at the bank is only 12 yuan, and the buying price is 12.25 yuan, a difference of 0.25 yuan, which is a new record since the market opened. Transactions are still active. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, although foreign firms have closed out their positions, foreign banks' willingness to supply is still strong, and there has ultimately been no change.</p>
<p>A Buying Rush Was Triggered at the Morning Opening</p>
<p>In the early morning, the recent decline in London's long-term interest rate continued by 0.0625, while the forward rate remained unchanged. New York's silver price remained fixed, and London's raw gold fell by 0.5 pence. The exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars and against Shanghai were both stable, while the rate against French francs was slightly higher by 0.025. The US dollar rate against British pounds was higher by 0.0625, while the rates against Shanghai and French francs were stable. The Central Bank's listed rates for various exchanges remained unchanged. At the morning opening, the banks' selling price for spot goods was 6.5 pence for British pounds and 12.625 yuan for US dollars, which was the same as last Saturday's afternoon closing, with no change. After the opening, foreign firms were busy settling spot payments, and Chinese merchants followed suit to close out their positions. However, because foreign banks maintained their usual operations, there was little change. It is estimated that foreign firms first settled with HSBC for British pounds at a spot rate of 6.5 pence, and then successively closed out their positions for US dollars with Hua Bi, Da Tong, and a certain bank at a spot rate of 12.625 yuan. When HSBC's listed rate was announced and remained unchanged, and the balance tax for silver was announced and continued to fall by 0.005, resulting in a tax of 3.00%, foreign banks' willingness to supply futures was very weak, causing the situation to be very tight, and the monthly interest rate was even higher. This led to a general interest in arbitrage among wealthy individuals. It is estimated that Chinese yarn and flower firms absorbed US dollars from Da Tong, You Li, and Hua Bi for this month at a rate of 12.5 yuan, while simultaneously selling US dollars to Da Tong, You Li, and Hua Bi for July at a rate of 12.25 yuan. It is estimated that Chinese yarn and flower firms discounted 0.25 yuan for US dollars, which is about 1 cent per month (excluding commissions). Subsequently, the futures market continued to tighten sharply. Near noon, the foreign firm Holland sold spot Hong Kong dollars to a foreign firm at a price of 43.75 yuan, and the situation was very stable. By the time of the noon closing, the banks' selling price for spot goods remained the same as the morning opening, while the futures rates for British pounds for this month were 6.375 pence, and for US dollars were 12.375 yuan. The rates for British gold for July were 6.1875 pence, and for US dollars were 12 yuan. At that time, the interest rate for swapping spot goods for this month (calculated for eleven days) reached as high as 5.5%. The above are all banks' discounted prices, and the actual interest rate for arbitrageurs to swap spot goods for this month is about 4%.</p>
<p>Spot Goods Remain the Same as the Previous Day</p>
<p>In the afternoon, foreign firms continued to close out their positions, and HSBC settled for British gold at a spot rate of 6.5 pence. They also closed out their positions for US dollars with a US bank at a spot rate of 12.625 yuan. The spot situation remained unchanged, while the futures market became slightly more stable due to the supply from Chinese yarn and flower firms and the Bombay Banking Corporation. It is estimated that the Chinese yarn and flower firms sold British gold for this month to Hua Bi at a rate of 6.4375 pence. Following this, the Bombay Banking Corporation sold US dollars for July to the Western firm Sassoon at a rate of 12.125 yuan. Later, Anda sold spot Hong Kong dollars to a foreign firm at a price of 43.75 yuan. By the time of the evening closing, the banks' selling price for spot goods was 6 pence for British pounds and 12.625 yuan for US dollars, which was roughly the same as the noon closing. The rates for British pounds for this month were 6.375 pence, and for US dollars were 12.3775 yuan. The rates for British gold for July were 6.875 pence, and for US dollars were 12 yuan. As a result, compared to last weekend, there was no change in the spot prices for British pounds and US dollars, while the futures prices for British pounds tightened by 0.125 and for US dollars tightened by 0.3125. The Hong Kong exchange rate also remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Exchange Market Is Quite Firm</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 19th - The exchange market opened firm this morning, with no change in rates. At 10:15 AM, it was slightly looser. The long-term rate for British pounds was 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 0.8125, the spot rate was 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 0.8125, and the forward rate was 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 0.78125. The spot rate for US dollars was 28.875 yuan, and the forward rate was the same. At 11:30 AM, the market atmosphere was tight and stable. By 11:40 AM, it suddenly softened. The spot rates for British pounds and US dollars returned to their original morning levels, the forward rate for British pounds was the same, and the Shanghai exchange rate rose by 1.5 yuan to 229 yuan. The market opening at 2:30 PM in the afternoon also saw no change.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Interbank Loan Rates and Discount Rates Simultaneously Increased, Corresponding to the Suspension of Interest Payments on Public Bonds <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Since the foreign exchange black market in this city sharply contracted, gold soared, and prices rose daily, the supply of silver has been very tight. The Shanghai Banking Association's reserve committee's interbank lending rates and discount rates have always been: 0.25 national currency for interbank lending rates for public bonds, 0.2 for remittances, and 0.25 national currency for 90-day acceptance bills, 0.2 for remittances, and 0.22 for interbank remittance interest rates. Starting yesterday (the 19th), the interbank lending rates and discount rates have been changed to 0.3 national currency and 0.28 for remittances. The interbank remittance interest rate has been changed to 0.3 (the above are all calculated per 1,000 yuan per day). (Y)</p>
<p>There are still rumors circulating in the legal tender market that foreign banks are reluctant to accept banknotes, and even if they are willing to accept them, they will often limit it to the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank. What they prefer are payment orders, and payment orders are still mainly for the three banks. The electronic transmission from the Ministry of Finance that it will not pay interest on domestic debt seems to indicate a further contraction of currency. The increase in interbank lending rates and discount rates may provide some clues.</p>
<p>The discount rate for remittance bills has increased because the supply of cash in the market is extremely scarce, and the demand is even greater. In the morning, each 1,000 yuan was as high as 52.5 yuan, and in the afternoon, it rose further to a final price of 54 yuan, which is 2 yuan higher than last Saturday. The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association also reached its peak since the (August 13th) Shanghai War. Yesterday, the rate was 0.22 in both the morning and afternoon markets, which is said to be another increase of 0.02 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e62">British and American Gold Notes Experience Mixed Fluctuations <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Last Saturday, British pure gold fell by 0.5 pence, and the British pound-US dollar exchange rate rose by 0.0625. Yesterday, foreign exchange firms in this city had very high settlement volumes, and foreign banks had ample supply, leading to a stable market price. The rumor circulating last Saturday that HSBC Bank would stop supplying and the exchange market would change has now been proven unfounded. However, the forward market is very weak. When the spot gold market opened, HSBC's listed rate remained unchanged, and the market situation immediately stabilized. Customers of gold firms increased their supply, and the market price was 2,620 yuan, which is 60 yuan lower than last Saturday. However, the forward British pound was tight, people were confident, and gold firms actively absorbed gold, leading to a steady increase in the market price. The afternoon market was very firm. In the afternoon, the forward British pound became even weaker, and the difference between the near-term and long-term rates was quite large. Moreover, since domestic public bonds guaranteed by customs revenue will have their interest payments suspended, securities firms also came to absorb gold, giving the market price a strong impetus to rise. The evening closing price was 2,700 yuan, which is a further increase of 20 yuan compared to last Saturday. Foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, were in high demand due to the soaring spot gold market, and their market prices were even higher. British and American gold notes were in great demand, but because the exchange rate was stable and near-term, they quickly fell back down. Hong Kong notes, French franc notes, Dutch notes, etc., were not in high demand and fell back down. Only German gold notes were in demand, and their market prices were quite high. The supply of Japanese gold notes was not smooth, and the evening closing price was 1.002 yuan. Korean notes were at 0.86 yuan. The Public Association's transactions were not strong. Bao Xiang sold 500 yuan of US gold notes to Sen Tai, and Qin Tai sold 50 British pounds of gold notes to Xiang Kang. Ren Bei sold 50 British pounds of gold notes to Jin Tai. Yesterday's market prices were: British gold notes rose by 0.5 yuan, British gold notes fell by 0.1 yuan, British American gold pounds rose by 1.2 yuan, US gold notes fell by 0.075 yuan, Hong Kong notes fell by 0.03 yuan, French franc notes fell by 0.003 yuan, Singapore notes, Dutch notes, and Annam notes each fell by 0.05 yuan, rupee notes fell by 0.02 yuan, Canadian notes fell by 0.1 yuan, Philippine notes fell by 0.05 yuan, German gold notes rose by 0.1 yuan, and Australian gold notes fell by 0.4 yuan. Only Italian notes and Siamese notes remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Yarn Market Experiences Many Twists and Turns; Speculators Exhausted; Transactions Abundant <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market started with rain and wind because the rumors circulating last week were completely unfounded, and the exchange rate was not changed at all. The bulls were greatly disappointed and the market plunged by more than ten yuan in an instant. In the afternoon, rumors revived, saying that securities were falling and that interest payments would be suspended. Buying interest suddenly surged, and the market price jumped again. The highest peak for 20-count Double Horse yarn reached 510 yuan, and then the bulls entered the market and the price fell back again. In short, the yarn market has been unsettled recently, and speculators are restless. Moreover, transactions are abundant, so it is not surprising that there will be changes of 1 or 20 yuan on any given day.</p>
<p>As for the current yarn situation, the opening in the early morning was inevitably too strong due to the upward trend of the previous day. The exchange rate was unchanged, and the price of gold fell, causing people to become uneasy. Moreover, a large dealer suddenly entered the market with a large amount of yarn, estimated to be 400 to 500 bales. Therefore, the market price fell rapidly. 20-count Double Horse spot yarn was bought by a Hong Kong dealer for 20 bales at a price of 506 yuan. Soon after, the price fell sharply, breaking through the 500 yuan mark to 493 yuan. The warehouse receipt price was 483 yuan, which was more than 14 yuan lower than the previous day. By the time of closing, the situation had improved slightly, and the price of foreign warehouse goods was 496 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 487.5 yuan. The opening in the afternoon was not much earlier, and the price was not much different from the previous day. In an instant, buyers swarmed in, and the market surged. Securities firms and gold firms all came to buy yarn, and both sides were neck and neck, causing the market price to rise frequently. 20-count Double Horse yarn rose to 510 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 501 yuan. Before long, those who had made a profit sold off, and the price fell back again to 502 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 493 yuan. The price then rose again, and by the time of closing, the price of 20-count Double Horse spot yarn was 505 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 496.5 yuan. It is noted that the total amount bought by various dealers throughout the day was 3,910 bales. On the 20th, 940 pieces of yarn were shipped to Shantou, and 220 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The market prices were: 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 2 yuan, Shepherd yarn fell by 4 yuan, and Double Globe yarn fell by 4 yuan. However, 10-count coarse yarn was unique in that it rose by 5 to 10 yuan due to demand from Yunnan dealers, which was because it had not risen much over the weekend. The price of 32-count single yarn was average. Shenxin No. 9 Factory offered 3,000 bales of 2-count Double Horse yarn at a price of 480 yuan (all payment orders). Anda Factory offered 100 bales of 20-count Flying Tiger yarn for July and August at a price of 480 yuan. The amount bought by each dealer is listed below:</p>
<p>Peers 2,640 Yunnan 460</p>
<p>Shantou 420 Hong Kong 245</p>
<p>Wenzhou 15 Mainland 20</p>
<p>Total 3,910</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market also rose and fell rapidly. The morning price was average, and the price rose again in the afternoon. The price of 20-count Yueqin yarn for this month was 420 yuan.</p>
<p>5,000 Bales of Indian Cotton Traded</p>
<p>Regarding the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market initially rose due to the increase in prices in Liverpool and the forecast of bad weather in the southern cotton fields of the United States, resulting in high spot prices. The price then fell back slightly due to the tight situation in the Far East. There has been no development in Washington regarding the agricultural relief bill, so dealers are all taking a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, the closing price was 7 to 8 pounds higher than the previous day. The forecast for Indian swift cotton was an increase of 1 rupee. The Egyptian market was closed.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, factories generally had sufficient inventory and had no intention of purchasing for the time being. However, wealthy individuals at sea had a lot of idle funds, so they engaged in foreign exchange arbitrage in the market and purchased and stored foreign exchange, resulting in an unusually tight exchange rate and an increase in the price of cotton by 4 to 5 yuan per dan when converted to legal tender. However, dealers had very high intentions. Even in the midst of this upward trend, they had a strong intention to purchase. The price of 10-count Indian cotton Pingguoer reached a new high of 85 yuan. Yesterday, dealers traded a total of more than 5,000 bales.</p>
<p>The domestic cotton trade was cut off, and all transactions in the market were in the world of Indian cotton. Shenxin Factory had a slight appetite, but no other packages were heard to have been traded. However, the dealers were lively and excited, but not as prosperous as in the past. The selling price remained high. Only 153 bales of cotton from northern Jiangsu arrived in Tongzhou. The current cotton situation is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Greed of Cloth Factories Difficult to Satisfy, Still Hoping for Prices to Rise; Resumption of Postal Delivery in Yunnan Province Adds Color to the Market <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday's cloth market was extremely chaotic. Generally, the goods sold by floating households were similar to those sold the week before. Later, because the factories had high intentions, the prices of various goods were very high, making it difficult to match the market prices. Most dealers also expected prices to rise and were unwilling to wait. In the afternoon, East cloth rose back up, and the forward market was particularly strong. The sellers were even more determined to hold their prices. As a result, coarse cloth rose by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan per bolt, fine cloth and fine twill rose by 0.1 to 0.25 yuan, and coarse twill rose by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The most active transactions were on this street. Stockpilers purchased more than 300 bales of coarse cloth and fine twill. Dyeing factories purchased more than 200 bales of dyed blank fine twill. A wholesale dealer on this street purchased 200 bales of coarse cloth. Dealers from Zhejiang and Guangdong purchased 200 bales of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill. Dealers from Yunnan, with destinations including Haiphong and Kunming, Mengzi, Gejiu, and Jianshui, had slightly increased their purchase volume due to the resumption of postal parcel delivery, and purchased more than 2,000 bolts of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and so on. Dealers from Kunming purchased 50 to 60 boxes of colored cloth, colored twill, and bleached cloth. Dealers from northern Jiangsu purchased more than 1,000 bolts of fine cloth and colored cloth.</p>
<p>East Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday's fine cloth and fine twill market fell in the morning and recovered in the afternoon. The market trend continued to rise. The price of medium-grade fine cloth increased by 0.1 yuan per bolt. The spot price of Longtou cloth was stable, but the demand for forward contracts was very strong. Dongmian Ito and other firms offered 400 bales of forward contracts for July and August at prices ranging from 15.4 to 15.5 yuan. The spot price of fine twill rose by 0.2 yuan. Yanghe sold it for 14.25 yuan. People on this street were optimistic, and stockpilers and sales agents purchased more than 1,000 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill. Only the Tianjin dealers were disinterested and continued to sell at high prices.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>On the 20th, 260 pieces of cloth were exported to Yantai, 15 pieces were exported to Tianjin, 500 pieces were exported to Shantou, and 400 pieces were exported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Retail</p>
<p>Although there are no detailed statistics on the actual sales in the market, the business in most foreign goods stores is not lively. This phenomenon is evidence that the high price of goods has reduced purchasing power. Therefore, the future of the cloth market is worth pondering.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Increase in Woolen Fabric Prices <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>15% to 20%</p>
<p>Ever since the foreign exchange sharply contracted on the 8th of this month, the woolen fabric industry expected future import prices to rise by 25% compared to the past market price of 8.25 yuan. Therefore, the market prices of woolen fabric inventory in various stores in this city have all increased. Stores such as Hua Fu Tai Hua Xin on Qipan Street and Yi Chang Tai Yi Feng have all increased their prices by 15% to 20% based on the sample prices they have already issued. However, there are still a few stores such as Mei Fa and Lian Xing that sell at the sample prices they have already issued, but the wholesale market price has also stopped.</p>
<p>In addition, the 17 yuan per yard Suxiken double-width fabric that Mei Fa received earlier has been selling very well recently and may soon be sold out. However, last week, a new type of British-made single-width Suxiken fabric (30-inch width) with better quality than the former arrived. It is said that the single-width fabric is sold for 10 yuan per yard (no samples are provided). (Jun)</p>
<h3 id="e66">The Price of Imported and Locally Produced Flour Rises Repeatedly; Wholesale Price in This District Increases by Another Five Cents <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the market unanimously experienced a price rebound. It is noted that since the incident involving North China merchants selling from the Tianjin concession occurred, there had been no significant sales for several days. Yesterday, being the beginning of the week, sales seemed to pick up. However, due to the tight exchange rates in recent days and rising rice prices, mills were quite reluctant to sell. Starting yesterday, the number two flour mill increased its asking price by five cents, changing it to four yuan and eighty-five cents. Apart from retail transactions in this district, bulk sales to merchants were initially rejected in the morning. Sales opened up slightly in the afternoon, but transactions were still limited. It is said that transactions for imported flour also felt sluggish. The "Bat" brand opened at four yuan and eighty-eight cents, while mid-range brands were quoted as high as four yuan and ninety cents yesterday. Buyers only offered a little over eighty cents, resulting in no wholesale transactions. The market situation also appeared quite firm. Today, 61,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Tianjin, 42,000 bags to Tanggu, 1,000 bags to Shantou, and 3,000 bags to Weihaiwei. 900 bags of bran will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the supply arrived incessantly, with the majority coming from the Nanjing area. Sellers were firm on their prices due to high costs. Moreover, with the flour market rebounding, sentiment was optimistic, and demand from hoarders was very strong. Yesterday, hoarders in this district arranged for over ten carts to go to Taiping Bridge, Baicheng, Kunshan, Nanjing, Puzhen, and other places. The market trend was firm and stable.</p>
<h3 id="e67">After the Dragon Boat Festival Settlement, Rice Prices Rebounded Slightly in the Afternoon <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Rice: After the supply from Hexia was blocked for a long time, now even the "wheelbarrow baozi" (a type of steamed bun) can only reach Changzhou due to the area being sealed off. The 500-600 bags of goods arriving early in the morning still opened higher. However, later it was heard that the exchange rate had stabilized, and prices had been soaring for days, causing sentiment to weaken. Furthermore, with the Dragon Boat Festival settlement approaching, there was little buying interest in this district. Therefore, by noon, the market for both thick and thin japonica rice showed a soft trend.</p>
<p>Customer Indica: Since the price increased, the supply from the production areas has been decreasing daily. Yesterday, there were over 3,000 bags of customer indica rice arriving by wheelbarrow. However, in the morning market, following the previous day's upward trend, sellers continued to raise prices. High-quality Wu indica and Jing indica were quoted above eighteen yuan. Subsequently, some merchants and hoarders took advantage of the high prices to sell off, and the market leveled off by noon. Conversely, intermediate and older varieties of indica rice were suppressed by two or three jiao. There was less high-quality indica rice in stock, and merchants were unwilling to sell it cheaply because it could be used interchangeably with local premium rice. However, local demand in this district decreased, and total transactions for the day were only around 3,000 bags. As for Du Yang premium rice and port premium rice, their selling prices also saw a decrease.</p>
<p>Notice: Market Notice: The 21st and 22nd will be the Dragon Boat Festival settlement period. Special closure for two days for settlement purposes.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Soybean Cakes are Readily Handled by the Fuzhou and Shantou Gangs; Soybean Oil Increases by Another One Yuan and Four Jiao; Goods From Kobe Have a Higher Price <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The current futures market for soybean cakes has seen prices converge, so yesterday's market only had current market prices, and trading was quite active. Although the inland sales market has been invaded by fertilizer, the Fuzhou and Shantou gangs have recently seen a surge in demand, so the market price, under the current situation of hoarding and strong sales, continued to rise by six to seven cents compared to the weekend. It is estimated that the Fuzhou market purchased 5,000 pieces of Dalian Yuan Ji brand cakes at a price of 3.135 yuan to 3.15 yuan, while the Shantou gang inquired about more than 10,000 pieces of Dasu brand cakes, with the price being on par with Yuan Xun brand cakes.</p>

Futures opened up five yuan in the morning, but plummeted thirty-four yuan in the afternoon. There was no market in New York.</p>
<p>Local Silk Market: Due to the export of fresh cocoons and exchange rate issues, sentiment is unanimously bullish. However, recent silk prices in the UK and US have been very weak, resulting in a significant gap between domestic and foreign silk prices. Yesterday, the price of white filature silk 13-15 was 2450 yuan, and the price of reeled silk was 1170 yuan. Given the current situation of exchange rate tightening, foreign firms may engage in negotiations.

<h3 id="e71">To Prevent the Influx of National Currency into Controlled Areas, Domestic Debt Principal and Interest Payments Will Be Made in Chongqing; Lottery Drawings for Various Public Bonds Will Proceed as Scheduled; the Central Bank Has Not Received Orders to Suspend Principal and Interest Payments; the Unofficial Public Bond Market Plunged Yesterday <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, 19th: A report in Chinese newspapers that the government will continue to pay the principal and interest on domestic public bonds secured by customs revenue, such as the Fuxing and Jinzhang bonds, has been denied by a spokesman for the Ministry of Finance. According to the spokesman, the Chinese government will not pay the principal and interest on domestic public bonds secured by customs revenue. The seventh lottery drawing for the Fuxing Public Bond will proceed as scheduled on July 31st, but principal and interest will not be paid. Holders of interest coupons for the drawn bonds can use these coupons as collateral to negotiate loans with banks. As Chinese newspapers have reported, in order to prevent a large influx of national currency into areas controlled by the Japanese army, principal and interest payments will be made in Chongqing in the future, while in Shanghai, they will be paid in the form of "exchange permit certificates." The principal and interest payments due on July 31st total 56,603,500 yuan. According to Xin Sheng She, the Ministry of Finance is maintaining its creditworthiness by continuing to repay principal and interest on domestic debt as usual. Yesterday, the Shanghai unofficial securities market saw a plunge in all prices due to rumors of suspended principal and interest payments. Because the National Debt Commission and the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank have not received any orders, the banking community believes that this cannot be verified. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Customs Bonds Principal and Interest Payments</p>
<p>The National Debt Fund Management Committee will conduct lottery drawings and pay principal and interest on bonds secured by customs revenue, such as the Unified, Fuxing, and Jinzhang bonds, as usual. (1) The seventh principal repayment lottery drawing for the five types of Unified Public Bonds (A, B, C, D, and E) has been completed monthly since February, and principal and interest will be paid on July 31st. (2) The seventh principal repayment lottery drawing for the Fuxing Public Bond is scheduled for July 10th, and principal and interest will be paid on August 31st. (3) The twelfth principal repayment lottery drawing for the Long-Term Financial Public Bond is scheduled for September 10th, and principal and interest will be paid on September 30th.</p>
<p>Rumors Abound, Unified Bond Prices Plunge</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai unofficial securities market saw a decline in the prices of all Unified Public Bond categories due to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing stating that "the Ministry of Finance spokesman announced the suspension of principal and interest payments on domestic public bonds secured by customs revenue; holders of drawn bonds and interest coupons can negotiate loans with banks." Rumors abounded in the market. At the close of trading in the afternoon, category A was at 60.05 yuan, category B at 51 yuan, category C at 50.25 yuan, category D at 49.9 yuan, and category E at 50.25 yuan. Compared to the previous period, category A fell by 3.85 yuan, category B fell by 4.35 yuan, category C fell by 3.5 yuan, category D fell by 3.1 yuan, and category E fell by 3.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Suspension of Principal and Interest Payments Cannot Be Confirmed</p>
<p>Last night, the Xin Sheng She reporter inquired with the National Debt Fund Management Committee, which manages the funds, and the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, which pays principal and interest, about whether principal and interest payments on the Unified, Fuxing, and Jinrong bonds had been suspended. They said that they had not received any orders from the Ministry of Finance or the head office of the Central Bank. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has telegraphed the head office to inquire about the truth. However, they expressed considerable doubt about the Reuters dispatch, as the first paragraph of the dispatch stated that principal and interest payments had been suspended, while the second paragraph stated that principal and interest payments would be made in Chongqing. Moreover, the dispatch mentioned that the Fuxing Public Bond principal and interest payments due on July 31st did not match the facts, as the payments due at the end of July were for the Unified Public Bond. Therefore, this news could not be confirmed.</p>
<p>Banking Sector Observations</p>
<p>According to sources in the banking sector, although the Ministry of Finance issued a notice on January 15th of this year outlining "measures for customs debt repayment in the future," in order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry continued to repay principal and interest on the Unified bonds maturing at the end of January, the Fuxing bonds maturing at the end of February, and the Jinzhang bonds maturing at the end of March as usual. It did not suspend principal and interest payments due to the seizure of customs revenue. However, in order to prevent the influx of national currency into occupied areas, payments were made in full in Chongqing, and "exchange permits" were issued in Shanghai and other places, with payments made in six installments. Therefore, it is widely believed that the Unified bonds maturing at the end of July will not have their principal and interest payments suspended.</p>

<p>Since the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee adjusted the black market foreign exchange rate in Shanghai, HSBC Bank has continued to provide foreign exchange to various industries with legitimate needs as much as possible. As a result, the black market exchange rate has tended to stabilize, with the British exchange rate at six and a half pence and the US exchange rate at 12.625 yuan, seemingly reaching the so-called new baseline. Last Saturday, the financial market rumored that HSBC had stopped selling black market foreign exchange, causing rumors to spread and cash prices to skyrocket, reaching a peak. The day before yesterday was Sunday, and banks were closed. After the market opened yesterday, Monday, facts proved that HSBC had not stopped selling, so people's hearts were calmed, the rumors subsided, and cash prices also fell back. The exchange rate remained stable, and HSBC's listed price did not change.</p>
<p>Unified, Fuxing, and Jinzhang Principal and Interest</p>
<p>The Unified Public Bond principal and interest payments due are 7,852,500 yuan for category A, 5,715,000 yuan for category B, 12,985,000 yuan for category C, 20,040,500 yuan for category D, and 9,646,000 yuan for category E. The Fuxing Public Bond principal and interest payments due on August 31st are 11,596,000 yuan. The Long-Term Financial Public Bond principal and interest payments due on September 30th are 1,532,812.5 yuan.</p>

<p>The Safety Campaign Promotion Week launched by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession has been exceptionally successful since it began the day before yesterday, due to the assistance of various parties and the efforts of the police to direct traffic. Yesterday was the second day of the promotion week, and Boy Scouts continued to distribute leaflets in Jing'an Temple, Caojiadu, and other places in the Western District. A portion of the lecture staff went to various refugee shelters and slum areas to lecture on road traffic rules, so that these refugees who fled from the inland could also protect their own lives.</p>
<p>Radio Broadcasting</p>
<p>Forty Chinese radio stations and more than ten Western radio stations take turns from 6:00 AM to 12:00 AM to have storytellers and radio reporters explain the simple rules to be followed when walking. The French Concession has also stepped up its efforts to maintain road traffic.</p>
<p>In addition to marking safe pedestrian lanes at intersections, they have also placed enamel signs at the four corners of intersections to make it easier for the public to understand and to broaden the effectiveness.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, in view of the fact that many rickshaw pullers are injured in traffic accidents every day, believes that it is necessary to expand publicity for the safety campaign. In addition to posting eye-catching slogans and pictures in all association offices to make the rickshaw pullers aware and alert, the association has also compiled a "Guide to Safety for Rickshaw Pullers," which is widely distributed to rickshaw pullers for their reading and attention. Every day, in the morning and afternoon, the association sends people to explain the significance of the safety campaign in detail at various association offices, and the rickshaw pullers who listen are very motivated. In front of each association office, a square of cloth with the figures of the Safety Campaign Conference is hung, attracting the attention of pedestrians.</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Ding Geller Murder Case Will Be Announced in Court This Morning; the British Court Continued Hearing the Case Yesterday; British Consul Thomas Was the Last Witness; the Coroner Will Judge Based on the Testimony Already Issued <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, the case of Ding Geller, of the Lun Chang Textile Factory in Pudong, who was brutally beaten and stabbed with bayonets by Japanese Marines and died at 5:30 PM on June 7, was continued in British court today (the 19th). According to the last witness, British Consul Thomas, who is in charge of Japanese affairs, said that hours after Ding Geller was beaten and stabbed by Japanese soldiers, Japanese Consul General Miura told British Consul General Philip that Ding Geller had been hit by a rifle butt and that he believed the injury was not serious.</p>
<p>Japanese Consul Notified the British of the Incident</p>
<p>Miura also said that he had not received any news that Ding Geller had been stabbed by a bayonet. Thomas continued that at 10:00 PM on June 6th, the British authorities received a phone call from the Japanese Consulate, saying that Ding Geller's injuries had worsened and that his relatives and friends should be notified. Only then did the British authorities learn that Ding Geller had been seriously injured. After receiving the news, Thomas obtained permission from the Japanese authorities to take a foreign doctor to Pudong. The doctor took a Japanese speedboat, and Thomas followed in a customs patrol boat.</p>
<p>Went to Pudong to See That the Injury Was Critical</p>
<p>When Thomas arrived in Pudong, the Japanese had already prepared to send Ding Geller to Shanghai. The doctor had also completed his examination of Ding Geller and said that the injury was very critical. Major Noji and another Japanese officer were at the scene and expressed great concern and hoped to cooperate. Ding Geller was then taken to the Gongji Hospital. Noji and another Japanese officer accompanied him to the hospital and only left the hospital after the operation was performed. After Thomas finished giving his testimony,</p>
<p>The Japanese Did Not Appear in Court</p>
<p>Coroner Haines said that he had asked the Japanese authorities to send three members of the Marine Corps to court to testify, but they did not appear. Therefore, he had to judge based on the existing testimonies. The British court set the verdict to be announced at 10:15 AM tomorrow (the 20th).</p>

<p>One Machine Gun Was Seized; More Than Ten People Were Arrested</p>
<p>The Japanese and puppet forces in western Shanghai are extremely concerned about the towns west of Beixinjing, regarding them as guerrilla areas. Therefore, the puppet police stationed there have all been withdrawn, and "citizen certificates" have been suspended in Qidou, Huacao, and other towns. Secret agents have been investigating the situation there for several months. The other day, in the early morning, a large team of more than one hundred Japanese soldiers, traveling in four trucks and carrying light and heavy machine guns, small steel cannons, and other equipment, fully armed, surrounded the town of Huacao. Machine guns were set up at all entrances and exits, aiming at the town, as if facing a formidable enemy. They entered the town to search at dawn. At that time, it was the time when villagers were carrying vegetables to market. The Japanese soldiers strictly inspected all villagers entering the town, and anyone who was slightly careless was beaten. They were only allowed to enter and not allowed to leave. They searched every household, extremely thoroughly. The townspeople were terrified. However, the guerrillas were not stationed in the town. Only one machine gun was left behind in a small teahouse, which was unfortunately seized. The search lasted for three hours. As a result, more than ten innocent civilians were arrested, including someone of the American Zhongmei Store and his wife. They were tightly bound and taken away. It is now heard that the wife of Jiang has been released, but how the other arrested civilians will be dealt with is still unknown.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Various Citizens' Associations Pay Attention to People's Food; Please Immediately Suppress Rice Prices; Thoroughly Investigate the Reasons for the Rise in Rice Prices; Impose Severe Sanctions on Manipulators <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The price of rice in Shanghai has been rising daily recently, breaking the 20-yuan mark, which has a profound and significant impact on people's food and social tranquility. The 15th, 16th, 18th, 27th, 36th, and 37th district branches of the Shanghai First Special District City Joint Association believe that the city's rice reserves are still around 500,000 bags, which is sufficient for regulation. Moreover, as the moldy season is approaching, which is usually the time when hoarders release stocks and rice prices are suppressed, there is now such a drastic reversal, which is clearly due to unscrupulous merchants manipulating the market. They have jointly submitted a petition to the City Joint General Association, requesting that rice prices be suppressed as soon as possible to maintain the food supply for four million citizens and ensure social tranquility and order, and suggesting the following measures: (1) Thoroughly investigate the reasons for the rise in rice prices and impose the most severe sanctions on manipulators. (2) Reset new price limits that must not be exceeded. (3) Streamline supply as much as possible. It is hoped that letters will be forwarded to the concession authorities and various rice industry groups for swift and effective remedies.</p>
<p>Market Transaction Prices Slightly Stabilize</p>
<p>Due to speculation and manipulation by hoarders, the bean and rice market has repeatedly pushed prices higher without allowing them to fall, causing the price of Du rice to reach new highs. Although the Market Management Committee has tried its best to persuade them, it has been ineffective. After the market opened at 9:00 AM yesterday, prices initially showed a tendency to continue rising. However, as the hoarding interest waned and sales in this district were sluggish, prices gradually stabilized, slightly the same as the market price the day before. First-grade Changshu Zhenbai japonica rice was at 21.5 yuan, while various Zhongjue rice ranged from 17 yuan to 20 yuan. The chaotic situation in the market has been slightly curbed, as hoarders are deeply afraid that the concession authorities will implement sanctions.</p>
<p>Rice Reserves Exceed 520,000 Bags</p>
<p>The Bean and Rice Industry Association yesterday released its 12th report on rice reserves, which concluded that total rice reserves were 523,822 bags, a decrease of 43,766 bags from the previous period. The Bank of China warehouse had the most, with 94,610 bags, followed by Zhexing warehouse with 78,704 bags, Shiye warehouse with 55,926 bags, Mintai warehouse with 29,529 bags, Dinghe warehouse with 24,962 bags, Longmao warehouse with 20,591 bags, and Xinhua warehouse with 17,085 bags.</p>
<p>Market Holiday for Dragon Boat Festival Settlement</p>
<p>The Market Management Committee issued a notice yesterday stating that the 21st of this month is the Dragon Boat Festival and settlements will be handled as usual. Therefore, there will be a holiday for two days (that is, the 21st and 22nd), and trading will resume as usual from the 23rd. The reason for the decrease in Shanghai's rice reserves in this period is that the general public fears that rice prices will rise again and have purchased in advance. Trading in various rice shops was extremely active in the middle of last week. Although it is impossible to investigate the rice reserves of the public, it is estimated that there are also more than 500,000 bags. Therefore, the overall food situation in Shanghai will not lead to a lack of panic, and the rice shortage of 1937 will not be repeated.</p>
<p>Obstructed Rice May Be Allowed to Be Released</p>
<p>A Xin Sheng She reporter learned from rice industry groups yesterday that the rice shipped from inland rivers to Shanghai, which was detained at the rice market ferry, totaled about 40 to 50 businesses with about 5,000 bags. After negotiations by various rice merchants, it is heard that they will be allowed to be released, but a tip must be paid. If the release of the obstructed rice becomes a reality, the price of rice in Shanghai may fall back slightly. At present, there are reports of shipping restrictions in producing areas such as Changshu and Wuxi, but rice from the above places still arrives quickly, so the transport of rice from producing areas to Shanghai has not been interrupted, as evidenced by the facts.</p>
<p>Hope That the Authorities Will Maintain People's Food Supply</p>
<p>Various rice industry groups, such as the Bean and Rice Industry Association, the Rice Shop Association, the Rice Dealers Association, the North and South Gangs, and the Changshu Association, believe that the soaring price of domestic rice in the Shanghai market is unreasonable, but they are unable to take action due to difficult circumstances. Therefore, they have suggested that the authorities of the two concessions quickly devise a proper solution to crack down on the manipulation of speculators and find ways to stabilize prices in order to maintain the people's food supply. It is heard that the rice management committees of the two concession authorities are very concerned about the soaring price of rice and are considering appropriate measures in addition to investigating market prices at any time.</p>

<p>The Italian ship Anda Alagi, weighing over 2,000 tons, has been chartered to the Japanese merchant Yamashita Steamship Company. Originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai today to load flour and other goods for Dalian, it sailed to the Bund outside Wuma Road at 2:00 PM yesterday to turn around and dock at the Hongxing Wharf in Pudong to load cargo. A French flagship happened to be anchored there. The Anda ship was careless when turning around and collided with the French flagship. The French warship has a large hull, so it suffered no damage despite being hit hard. After causing the accident, the hull of the Anda ship was severely damaged. Today's voyage has been temporarily canceled and it will immediately enter the dock for repairs.</p>

<p>War Above Songji Port; Chinese Army Forces Along the River Are Very Strong</p>
<p>The Japanese side attempts to control shipping on the north bank of the Yangtze River, sending three small, shallow-water naval vessels to harass various coastal ports. They also use small motorboats to carry a dozen or so naval personnel to patrol the sea, often intercepting foreign merchant ships for inspection. At the same time, they instruct the Nisshin Company to open a new shipping route to the North Sandy Areas. Originally, they planned to send ships to operate from yesterday, but now it is learned that the Nisshin Company is aware that the ports in the North Sandy Areas, from Songji Port to Dongyihao Port, are all within the control of the Chinese army, with only Qinglong Port being a Japanese restricted area where ships can freely dock. At the same time, the maritime guerrilla headquarters of the Chinese army frequently sends teams to attack the Japanese army on the sea in coordination with friendly forces on land, with great momentum. There is no guarantee that Japanese ships operating on this line will be able to secure passengers or cargo. Navigation is also difficult. Moreover, guerrilla warfare has recently broken out in areas above Songji Port, and the situation is chaotic. Japanese ships passing through are prone to incidents. Therefore, the Nisshin Company's plan to open a shipping line to the North Sandy Areas is temporarily difficult to implement.</p>

<p>Freight Rates to Increase</p>
<p>Regarding Shanghai-Ningbo passenger and freight rates, a meeting was also held yesterday to discuss price increases. However, this matter still requires consulting the opinions of the customs brokerage industry, so a decision has not yet been made. However, the principle of increasing prices has been approved and will be implemented in the coming days.</p>

However, last Saturday, Swire Company's Shengjing vessel to Tianjin did not load any cargo even for Tanggu. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson and Swire Companies received telegrams from their Tianjin offices stating that the Risheng and Shuntian vessels that arrived in Tianjin last week were not searched, and the situation was slightly more relaxed than before. After receiving the telegrams, the two companies announced yesterday (Monday) that they would resume loading for Tianjin. Therefore, the Guisheng and Hunan vessels departing this afternoon are loading as usual. It is reported that the two vessels are carrying a large quantity of flour to Tianjin.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Visit to Mr. F.L. Hawks Pott at Fan Wang Du (Part Two) <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— EL</p>
<p>After discussing newspaper matters, we began to talk about current affairs.</p>
<p>Summarizing Mr. Pott's observations, his conclusion on current affairs was roughly as follows: No one dared to predict how long the war would last. He said, "As the American ambassador has said, five years, ten years, or even twenty years." When talking about this issue, he also said that recently, at a dinner with Dr. Yen Hui-ching, everyone discussed this matter and reached similar views.</p>
<p>For at least fifteen minutes, Mr. Pott analyzed and explained the international issues we specifically pointed out. His kind and resolute face showed a serious attitude from time to time. I can honestly say that the answers he gave us were indeed inspiring.</p>
<p>Mr. Pott originally had a pipe in his mouth, and the lingering smoke had disappeared along with the end of our conversation. While he stood up to fill his pipe and light a match, I would like to add a more relaxed fact here.</p>
<p>When we were talking to Mr. Pott about the Chinese newspaper industry, due to Mr. Pott's many years of reading the Shen Bao, we talked about the difficulty of delivering newspapers to other cities now.</p>
<p>"Doesn't your school have a long history in the journalism department?" I asked.</p>
<p>"It is very appropriate and necessary to have a journalism department in Shanghai. The number of students in our school's journalism department has not increased much recently. Many graduates have gone abroad for further studies in the past."</p>
<p>Here, Mr. Pott mentioned our colleague, Mr. Wu Jiatang, the deputy editor-in-chief of the Dalu Bao. —C and I are both familiar with Mr. Wu, who entered Missouri University in the United States after graduating from St. John's journalism department. —We spontaneously expressed the excellence of St. John's journalism department talents.</p>
<p>Our conversation shifted to daily life and travel, feeling that discussing our old professions was going to be tedious.</p>
<p>"Are you planning to go out this summer?" C asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, I really want to go to Qingdao." According to Mr. Pott, Mrs. Pott's health has been poor recently. If they go, it will be during July and August. "We have a small residence there," he said.</p>
<p>Speaking of travel, Mr. Pott told us that he always returns to the United States every five years—he is a native of New York City, born on February 22, 1864—the most recent time was three years ago, when the war broke out in Shanghai. "I met Guo Taiqi and Kong Xiangxi in London. At that time, Shanghai asked me to postpone my trip to China and wait there for a while," he said. However, Mr. Pott finally returned to Shanghai last spring, saying that it had been a year and a half since he left his second hometown.</p>
<p>"When you came back, sir, how different did you feel compared to when you left Shanghai?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Wow, very different." Mr. Pott shook his head and answered directly. Just in terms of the school itself, he said that when he came back, this place—referring to Fan Wang Du—had been greatly threatened. Mr. Shen Siliang—the vice president of St. John's—had already moved the school to the concession, which is now the Dalu Commercial Center. At first, there were not many students, only more than 200 at most, but now there are more than 1,200.</p>
<p>Mr. Pott mentioned several other famous church schools with great concern, such as Shanghai University, Jinling University, and Zhijiang University; and talked about Fudan University, Daxia University, which moved to Sichuan Guiyang, and a part of Jiaotong University in Shanghai. He truly showed great enthusiasm and concern for the education cause.</p>
<p>"I heard that your school may move back here. Is that true?"</p>
<p>"Probably a part of it can be moved back in the future. We plan to start with a summer school first, and then decide based on the changes in the overall situation," Mr. Pott replied.</p>
<p>"Has the school building here been lost?" We looked at the green grass outside the window and the quiet surroundings, and couldn't help but ask.</p>
<p>"No, it hasn't," Mr. Pott replied happily. "However, since the bridge over the river was destroyed, it is very inconvenient to go to the science museum on the other side of the river."</p>
<p>Mr. Pott said to us humorously and with a smile, "Although separated by a river, it is like being in your own house, but you can't go without a pass, and you have to take a boat."</p>
<p>Because of these words, the above conversation about the review of current affairs issues was brought out.</p>
<p>Our interviewee continued to smoke his pipe. Due to Dr. W.W. Yen (Yan Huiqing), he spoke of a group of old students who had studied abroad, such as Wu Tingfang and Tang Shaoyi.</p>
<p>Mr. F.L. Hawks Pott has taught many talented people, and many famous officials and dignitaries today have been taught by him personally. We feel that this 75-year-old scholar, who has dedicated his life to education and preaching, is truly worthy of respect.</p>
<p>He said that Mr. Junren's father had taught at St. John's, and Dr. Yan himself had edited an English dictionary for the Commercial Press very early. Undoubtedly, these two things are the foundation of education: he was very happy for the Yan family.</p>
<p>"Tang Shaoyi and others were the first group of students to go to the United States. They were very young when they went. When I was studying at Columbia University, Tang Shaoyi and I were classmates." Mr. Pott suddenly lost more than 50 years and yearned for the beautiful dreams of his youth, looking particularly energetic.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Pott is an "Old Shanghai"... "Old China"... and a teacher of many old Chinese students who have studied abroad.</p>
<p>Mr. Pott came to China in 1886—the twelfth year of Guangxu.</p>
<p>He became the president of St. John's College in 1888. Married in the same year.</p>
<p>In 1890, he obtained an honorary doctorate from Trinitx College.</p>
<p>In 1910, he obtained an honorary doctorate in theology from the University of Edinourgh.</p>
<p>He remarried in 1911.</p>
<p>In 1929, his alma mater, Columbia University, awarded him an honorary S.T.D. doctorate.</p>
<p>Let us temporarily ask Mr. Pott to stop in Shanghai 50 years ago:</p>
<p>"When you first came to Shanghai, sir, what was the life situation of foreigners like?" C asked.</p>
<p>"The cost of living was very low at that time," Mr. Pott replied. "Except for the lower salaries of the missionaries, ordinary people lived a comfortable life like 'princes and sons of noble families', with tall buildings and many servants. Low prices made all expenses reduced."</p>
<p>"What did everyone do for entertainment?" We traveled in our minds among the foreigners who lived a life of ease at that time, and asked Mr. Pott like this.</p>
<p>"Hunting and fishing are the best sports; a more comfortable entertainment at that time was to take a yacht to the countryside. Almost everyone had a residential yacht?"</p>
<p>After Mr. Pott finished speaking these words, he paused for a while, touched his chin with his hand, and then told us something: He said, "The Chinese at that time always thought that foreigners were rich. After the first group of students studying abroad went to the United States, they saw white people doing hard labor in a certain shipyard, just like the Chinese coolies. They were very surprised!"</p>
<p>Speaking of the relics of Shanghai, we thought of Mr. Pott's work "A Short History of Shanghai," so we asked Mr. Pott to tell us about his works over the years.</p>
<p>According to the year of publication, the books he wrote are as follows:</p>
<p>“The causes of outbreak in China”, 1900 (describing the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi year)</p>
<p>"Sketch of Chinese History", 1907 (Outline of Chinese History)</p>
<p>"Lessons on Shaughai Vernacular", 1809 (Shanghai dialect textbook)</p>
<p>"The Emergency in China", 1912 (describing the Xinhai Revolution)</p>
<p>"A Short History of Shanghai". 1928 (A Short History of Shanghai)</p>
<p>In addition, he has also translated several theological books and participated in the work of translating the Anglican "Book of Common Prayer" and other books.</p>
<p>Our conversation circled in space a few times and returned to education.</p>
<p>This white-haired educator answered us the following points without treating us as "laymen" questioners:</p>
<p>"What do you think of Oxford and Cambridge in England?" C asked.</p>
<p>"I didn't study there, but I visited those two schools. Their education system is indeed very good, but it is too expensive. They are quite like the traditional Chinese 'master-apprentice' system. They do not advocate class teaching, but follow famous teachers separately."</p>
<p>"According to your point of view, which education system should China adopt?"</p>
<p>Mr. Pott smiled and said, "Naturally, I would say the American style." What he meant was that China's current education system has adopted some from Germany and some from France. How to be suitable cannot be generalized. Later, he talked about vocational education, saying that the American one can be taken as an example.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of students choosing subjects, he said: "Students now like to choose practical courses, such as medicine and engineering, which is very correct. However, philosophy occupies a very important position in all sciences and should not be ignored. In the past, Chinese scholars paid the most attention to philosophy."</p>
<p>Summarizing Mr. Pott's meaning, studying should not be too mechanical, and culture is ultimately important. The philosophy of life is not just to decorate the surface, it should be placed in the main position.</p>
<p>In the moment when we were already fascinated and Mr. Pott seemed to sigh, C signaled to me, and we shook hands and said goodbye.</p>
<p>"Excuse me for not being able to accompany you two further, because there are still guests to come." Mr. Pott humbly sent us out of "Pott's residence." (End)</p>

<p>Yesterday, a bizarre shooting case suddenly occurred in the French Concession. This case is indeed very strange, because the person who committed suicide only fired one shot, but two people died unexpectedly. The investigation results are recorded below:</p>
<p>Husband Returns Home; Wife Transfers Love</p>
<p>The Russian woman Li Baofuxiou (transliteration) was previously married to an Englishman, so</p>
<p>"According to your point of view, which education system should China adopt?"</p>
<p>Since the woman had obtained British citizenship, she has now lost her husband, who has returned home. Li then met a French soldier, Te Aomo (transliteration), in Shanghai. The two fell deeply in love and recently lived together in Room 205 of the Luban Apartment on Luban Road.</p>
<p>Too Much Passion; Agree to Die Together</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Li and Te were both shot to death in their room in bed. Both had a gunshot wound to the head. At 11 o'clock, the apartment discovered the incident and reported it to the police. It was found that there was only one bullet. It is not known how it killed two people. After detailed investigation, it was learned that the two were indeed love suicides, becoming lovers in death. It is estimated that the blood case occurred at around 3 o'clock in the morning. One of the men and women took out a gun and shot themselves in the head. Because they were sleeping head to head, the bullet penetrated both heads, causing them to die at the same time.</p>

<p>A major embezzlement case involving the forgery and secret sale of fake "citizen certificates" occurred in Zhoupu Town, Nanhui. The protagonist is Wang Bin, a fake "detective" from the fake "police station." It is reported that the protagonist was arrested by the Japanese Pudong South District Special Affairs Agency yesterday. Many fake members of the Zhoupu fake "police station" are involved in the case. Because the Japanese side attaches great importance to this case, suspecting that they are colluding with the guerrillas, they have sent personnel to Zhoupu to investigate thoroughly. The results are not yet clear.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Collecting Scrap Copper and Iron; Gangsters Demolish and Extort; Two Arrests Made in Total, Case Under Investigation <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Liao Jianqiu from Nanjing, 44 years old this year, has always been engaged in the copper-tin hardware business. He now operates the Kaitai Copper-Tin Hardware Store at No. 39 Pingjili Road in the French Concession, collecting scrap copper and iron, wholesale and resale to a certain party for manufacturing military weapons, making a considerable profit. His family also lives in the store. At 6 or 7 o'clock in the morning on the 7th of this month, a customer, Mr. Jia, transported a batch of old copper and old iron from</p>
<p>Nanshi and sold it to Liao's Kaitai store. While they were discussing the price, three gangsters from Dongtai, Wang Chunyuan, Wang Dongguan, and Wang Daxiao, learned that Liao Jianqiu, the owner of Kaitai store, was buying copper and iron and reselling it overseas, considering him a bad merchant. They went to Kaitai store to try to demolish and extort. While they were arguing, the French police detective Cui Zhenguo and Chinese patrolman No. 338 happened to pass by and learned about the situation. They immediately arrested the three Wangs and</p>
<p>detained them in the police station</p>
<p>awaiting investigation. Unexpectedly, at 11 o'clock on the same day, Wang Chunyuan and others' accomplices, Wang Ronggui and the women Dai Xiuying and Wang Gushi, gathered more than ten people and swarmed to Kaitai store to cause trouble, tearing the store owner Liao Jianqiu's clothes and beating Liao's wife, Yao, causing her left cheek to be broken and bleeding. The store staff reported to the police, and Wang Ronggui, Dai Xiuying, and Wang Gushi were arrested. The rest fled. The police then escorted the six defendants to the Second Special Court for</p>
<p>interrogation and detention for investigation.</p>
<p>In the case, Liao Yuan, a judge, continued the trial in the first criminal court yesterday afternoon. Yuan Jiahuang, the lawyer of the French Concession administrative authorities, stated the case, filed a public prosecution based on the two charges of attempted fraud and joint injury, and the plaintiffs, the Liao Yao couple, stated the situation of the defendants' extortion and assault. When questioned, the defendants all denied and evaded, denying the charges. The court verified the confessions and ordered a postponement for investigation and further interrogation. The defendants were all returned to custody.</p>

At that time, the Western police chief Daviss, Chinese detective Li Yilian, and Chinese detective head Zhang Yunhong from the Yulin Road police station happened to be passing by on motorcycles, driving from east to west on Huade Road, passing the Lan Road intersection, when they suddenly heard shouts of robbery. They saw two robbers fleeing in front, and someone chasing behind. The detectives drove after them, and ordered them to stop with their guns. They arrested the two robbers, who were identified as Zhou Jinhe and Zhou A'jin, both from Tongzhou. A Youning brand pistol with two bullets and all the stolen money were confiscated from Zhou A'jin. The other three robbers fled. They were all taken to the police station, and escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the above situation, and stated that the defendants confessed in the police station that they went to rob with the fugitives Lu Changsan, Yu A'er, and Yu A'si, and requested a postponement. After Judge Chuan Lin questioned the plaintiff Fan Songping and the two defendants, he ordered them to be detained and postponed for investigation and verification.</p>

<p>Now that the bricks and tiles in Nanshi have been controlled, the broken walls and ruins have been cleared, and a group of ruffians has been hired to demolish unguarded houses. As a result, five lives were killed last month due to house demolition on Huining Road and Yingdong Road. Unexpectedly, at 3 PM the day before yesterday, two middle-aged men and women went to the Xundaocun Xun Daocheng area to demolish the remaining bricks and tiles, but the house collapsed and crushed the couple to death on the spot.

<p>Apprentice stabbed during robbery</p>
<p>The third branch of the Nanyang Soap Factory, located at No. 71 Carter Road in the Public Concession, was robbed last night around 9:00 PM by three bandits. Two of them were armed with handguns, and one was holding a sharp blade. They entered the store under the pretext of buying soap. One of them pointed a gun and threatened the staff, then walked to the counter, opened the drawer at random, and looted several dollars and small bills.

<p>Residents sign joint petition in opposition</p>
<p>There are 28 buildings, numbered 1988 to 2044 on Haig Road. They are currently rented to small business people for commercial purposes. The landlord is the Lai Kee Company. The area originally belonged to the Chinese territory, but after the "August 13th" incident, the French Concession authorities blocked the traffic with barbed wire. All the tenants moved to the concession to avoid danger. After the Nationalist army retreated west, the area was designated as a refugee area, and the French police department removed the barbed wire. The tenants then returned to resume their businesses. Recently, the number of residents has increased, but most are refugees. The Lai Kee Company recently wanted to increase the rent by 50%, causing great panic among the residents. Yesterday, they agreed to sign a joint petition requesting the landlord to withdraw the order, and to request consideration of the difficulties of the people and reduce the rent to maintain their livelihoods.</p>

<p>Pediatrician Shen Zhongfang Cares About Children's Happiness - Pediatrician Shen Zhongfang of Wu Yufang, Jing'an Temple Road, has been practicing medicine for decades and has extensive experience. In order to care about children's health, he advises parents to pay attention. The Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, and eating too many festival rice dumplings can easily cause illness. Moreover, rice dumplings are sticky and easily cause indigestion. While this may not be a problem for healthy adults, children are often made ill by eating rice dumplings. This year, damp and warm weather is prevalent, and measles is also spreading. If you eat sticky foods, they will stagnate in the stomach, making the situation worse if you get sick. Because I believe this is dangerous, I cannot remain silent. I hope parents will not dismiss my words.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having read the article in your newspaper (June 17) entitled "Doctor Prescribes Wrong Medicine to Five-Month Pregnant Woman," I find it to be inconsistent with the facts. It is a false rumor. It is true that a woman named Nujia, accompanied by her mother-in-law, came to me for treatment on May 26 of this year. She was suffering from typhoid fever. I prescribed a prescription, which was effective. She came for a follow-up visit on May 28. I asked about her menstrual cycle, and she said that she had been late every month since she got married and was now three months late. So, I prescribed a formula to regulate her Qi and nourish her blood. After taking the medicine, she became angry and stopped seeing me. Suddenly, at 3:00 PM on the 15th of this month, I received a telegram inviting me to make a house call, saying that the housewife of Wang Maoxing Noodle Shop on North Fujian Road was seriously ill and had been treated by many famous doctors without success. I, as a doctor, believed it to be true and went by car. Upon going upstairs, I saw Mrs. Dai Jia and her mother-in-law, one lying down and one sitting, and several unknown hooligans. When they saw me go upstairs, they immediately surrounded me, making a lot of noise, speaking rudely, and interfering with my actions, claiming that Dai Jia had had a miscarriage on the night of June 14, caused by taking my medicine, and forcing me to pay them off. I have been a doctor for five generations and have never mistakenly prescribed medicine that harmed others. The prescription I gave Mrs. Dai Jia was to regulate her Qi and nourish her blood and did not contain any abortifacient ingredients. Moreover, it had been more than eight days since she took the medicine, but she suddenly claimed to have had a miscarriage and there was no fetal matter. This was obviously an extortion attempt, which I did not want. After a long entanglement, we went to the police station to resolve the matter. The hooligans fled halfway, and only Dai Runzhi and one other person were taken to the police station. The authorities are still investigating. It is clear that she was not five months pregnant and did not experience any pain from taking the medicine. Therefore, your newspaper's report has twisted the facts and unfairly slandered me, causing me great regret. Regarding the facts, I have sent this letter to clarify the matter and avoid misleading rumors.</p>

<h3 id="e118">On Chinese Medical Art (3) <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Feng</p>
<p>Speaking of Art</p>
<p>Now I want to abstractly discuss the relationship between art and Chinese medicine by comparing them. The craft of art requires a long period of study. It involves a holistic understanding, not just a superficial view. Yet, its expression is often found in the smallest details, where the entirety of the art is revealed. Artists who are skilled in their craft create works that are not forced or artificial, but rather flow naturally. Observers are sometimes amazed by these works and praise them endlessly. Yet, when asked about the reasons behind their creation, even the artists themselves are often at a loss to explain, and critics can only offer superficial explanations.</p>
<p>The first condition of art is the importance of individuality: - Whether it is the art of time or the art of space, works should not be like woodblock prints, where all the products are identical. There should always be some individuality infused within. Therefore, people who appreciate art can distinguish the works of different artists through this individuality. For example, in poetry, prose, and sculpture, critics can recognize the works of a master directly without looking at the signature. When it comes to medicine and diagnosis, the existence of this individuality is even more complex and intricate. The individuality found in pure works of art is only one-sided, while the treatment of disease involves the relationship between both the physician and the patient. Physicians rely on their keen senses to gain insight into various disease states through methods of observation, auscultation, interrogation, and palpation, especially in the method of pulse diagnosis. There is individuality inherent in these keen senses. Therefore, even if new physicians are taught by the same master, their performance may differ. Moreover, if patients in the same area and at the same time contract the same disease, and are treated with the same method, the results may be good or bad. Because the individual personalities (temperaments) of the patients are different, the same treatment cannot be applied to everyone. This is the difference between the person administering treatment and the person receiving treatment. By extension, the same can be said for education. There is no difference in the transmission of knowledge between teacher and student. Since teaching is an art, then medicine is also an art.</p>
<p>The conditions of art are mostly relative: - Since ancient times, the creation of art, unlike science, has been unable to derive a fixed rule, limiting artistic creation. All art textbooks can only provide the names of things, explain what has happened, but not explain the reasons why it has happened. This is because there are too many relative conditions in art: clumsiness has its benefits, cleverness has its benefits, slowness is relative to speed, precision is relative to approximation, lightness and heaviness, excess and deficiency, lateness and earliness, height and depth, all these cannot be rigidly adhered to in poetry, writing, and music. Artists use their experience to find moderation and harmony among these relative conditions. This moderation is not like Mencius's so-called "a single move should not be rigidly adhered to." Centrality must have authority, and that authority is held in the hands of the artist. Speaking of experienced physicians, they often have a kind of grasp on treatment. What holds this grasp firmly is their skill and their experience. Whether they are treating above or below, using heavy or light dosages, they rely on their own abilities. This can be explained by the fact that two physicians can use different methods to cure the same disease. For example, a painter or calligrapher, their lines crisscross on the paper, but they have their own scale and measure in control. Calligraphy and painting are art, and treating disease and using medicine are also art.</p>
<p>Art is non-definitive: - Art is non-definitive, which can be understood without explanation. We see that sculptures of human figures are works of art, but their reprinted models are the works of craftsmen; written calligraphy and paintings are works of art, but the copied images are the works of art apprentices. If we ask the original artist who wrote or sculpted to create a second piece, there may be excesses or deficiencies, and it will certainly not be possible for the same achievement to come from the same hand. Then, physicians give different types of solutions according to the various types of diseases. The examination between the solution and the disease is accomplished by physicians who have artistic skill and apply their skill and wisdom. It is definitely not a set of stereotypical writing that is all the same. A disease can be adapted to two different views, and the difference in solutions depends on whether or not it is appropriate. Those that are appropriate can cure the disease.</p>
<p>Art is temporal: - The temporality of art itself is obvious, and the reasons for it do not need special explanation. The artist's creative process has temporal differences from morning to night, from yesterday to today. Then the schools and history of medicine need not be said to know that it has temporality; that is, even during a diagnosis, a movement of the hand, a diagnosis and a solution, as long as it does not deviate from its origins, and there are slight differences in weight, it is not worth the difference.</p>
<p>Enough, such a burdensome explanation, I think is useless, it is better to say the reason why Chinese doctors can cure all diseases, more practical than just talking about art.</p>
<p>Common Sense in Treatment</p>
<h3 id="e119">New Treatments for Asthma <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Wanbai</p>
<p>There are many types of asthma, with varying causes. The most common is "bronchial asthma," which is actually an allergic reaction or a functional disease of the reflex nerves. Its characteristic feature is swelling of the respiratory mucosa, increased secretion, and bronchial spasms, leading to difficulty in breathing.</p>
<p>Causes</p>
<p>The so-called allergic phenomenon is very similar to the sensitivity some people have to raw lacquer. If their skin comes into contact with lacquered objects, it becomes red, swollen, and inflamed, a condition known as lacquer dermatitis. This is the same type of phenomenon, except that protein sensitivity affects the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract. Therefore, people who are sensitive to certain proteins may experience difficulty breathing immediately upon encountering them. Conditions such as bronchitis, diseases of the nose and throat, heart and kidney diseases, and gastrointestinal diseases can all be distant causes of this condition.</p>
<p>The substances to which people are sensitive vary, including proteins in food, inhaled substances, metabolic products, bacteria, etc. There are also familial, local, material, and psychological factors. Details are omitted for brevity.</p>
<p>Symptoms</p>
<p>Before an attack, there are often premonitory signs such as chills, chest tightness, abdominal bloating, frequent urination, and mental depression. The attack often occurs during sleep at night, with a sudden feeling of breathlessness and increasingly rapid breathing. The muscles of the neck, sides, chest, and abdomen all move violently. Within minutes, the breathlessness reaches its peak, and exhaling becomes even more difficult. The lungs expand, and the person struggles for air. The face turns pale and displays fear. Mild cases may stop in a few minutes or hours, while severe cases may take three to five nights to reach their peak. Fever may occur, followed by easier breathing, frequent coughing, and expectoration of sticky phlegm. Once relief is obtained, the person is often exhausted and falls asleep. However, after any stimulation, the attack may recur, becoming more frequent and prolonged, making it a truly painful condition.</p>
<p>Treatment</p>
<p>Scientific medical treatment of diseases must first seek the underlying cause in order to eradicate it, not merely alleviate the immediate suffering. Experts have found that more than half of bronchial asthma patients are sensitive to proteins. Therefore, it is best to identify the specific protein(s) to which the patient is allergic. If a small amount of a protein-based ointment is lightly scratched onto the skin, and a rash-like reaction develops at the scratched area in about twenty minutes, it indicates sensitivity to that protein. It is best to avoid eating or contact with that protein to prevent attacks. Alternatively, a very small amount of the protein can be taken for a long period to develop resistance and prevent attacks.</p>
<p>However, this method is not very effective for people over middle age. It is best to examine whether there is an underlying organ disease acting as a trigger. Often, if that disease is cured, the asthma will not recur. For example, simple nasal polyps may seem unrelated to the condition, but many cases have shown that asthma is cured after their surgical removal.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many new treatments for this condition that have been adopted by the medical community. Some have appeared in recent medical publications, and several are selected here:</p>
<p>(1) Ascorbic Acid: A famous French physician used ascorbic acid (i.e., Vitamin C) to treat asthma, with good results in as many as 75% of cases. He stated that this drug is more effective for long-term recurrent asthma than for acute asthma.</p>
<p>(2) Autogenous Vaccine: The bacteria contained in the patient's sputum during an attack are cultured, propagated, and then killed. The bacterial fluid is then injected subcutaneously to stimulate the body's resistance. The reaction can be tested by inoculating the bacterial fluid on the skin first. Injections start with about 50 trillion bacteria, gradually increasing the dose each time, every five to seven days, with remarkable effectiveness.</p>
<p>(3) Universal Protein: These are non-specific proteins. Many pharmaceutical companies in various countries produce them under different names. Choose one that is familiar for long-term injection, as it is relatively convenient and widely used.</p>
<p>(4) Sterilized Milk: Take clean fresh milk, place it in a rubber-stoppered bottle, and boil it in water for about an hour. It can then be used for injection, starting with half to one cubic centimeter, injected once every one to three weeks, increasing by half a cubic centimeter each time, up to a maximum of three cubic centimeters. The intention is similar to the previous method.</p>
<p>(5) Whole Blood: Draw about five to ten cubic centimeters of blood from the patient's arm vein using a sterilized syringe and inject it immediately into the arm muscle, two or three times a week. The amount of blood can be increased as needed, up to a maximum of twenty cubic centimeters. This method is considered more reliable and effective than methods three and four.</p>
<p>(6) Artificial Fever: Common clinical experience has shown that the condition often resolves once fever develops. Therefore, artificial fever is often used to relieve suffering, similar to the treatment of neurosyphilis. However, some patients mistakenly believe that fever is a loss to the body and seek ways to reduce it, which actually weakens the body's resistance and prolongs the course of the disease. The method of inducing artificial fever should be chosen and implemented by a physician.</p>
<p>In addition, there are electrical and light therapies, but they are not widely used and will not be described further. Drugs such as hyoscyamine, epinephrine, and ephedrine can all immediately stop wheezing, but to prevent recurrence, the root cause of the disease must be found and treated fundamentally. It is important to note that although medical advances are constantly being made, their effectiveness is limited by the individual's constitution. As the saying goes, "A doctor can only treat illness, not destiny." This shows that the issue of life cannot be solved by medicine alone. We should be humble and seek the source of life.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Dreams · Memories · Reality <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Zijin</p>
<p>According to the classification made by the Japanese Shirakaba school writer Arishima Takeo, who committed suicide a few years ago for "Platonic" love, people's attitudes towards life can be roughly divided into three categories: The first is to keep their dreaming eyes fixed on the future, one "future" after another: building magnificent and exquisite pavilions in mid-air, composing their own future, and anticipating brilliant days. The second is to spend their remaining time solely reminiscing about the "past." These "ghosts of the past" use regret, sighs, tears, and illusory light to decorate a pile of ruins, a gray old castle, into a glorious scene, curling up in it, believing, admiring, and feeling content. They are both indifferent to the living "reality" and lazily uninterested in the misty future. Like the words celebrated by the demon poet Baudelaire, their whole life is just "intoxicated" in the past. The third is to neither cling to the "past" nor have pointless thoughts about the "future," but to grasp reality, affirm reality, and fight bravely in the real world. Of these three attitudes towards life, only the last one is the most glorious, the most moving, and the most worthy of being written about in bold strokes.</p>
<p>"Life is vast and difficult to predict." Our future is like a boundless sea, and there is no need for us to grope around blindly. Even if old Mr. Mentor, the great prophet in Homer's Odyssey, were still alive and well, he would not dare to predict whether your precious "dream" will come true. However, as "humans," we often continue to dream even though we have "tacit understanding," making us first-class fools. If the world makes you feel worried and resentful, and this world is a boundless sea of suffering for you, and you hate it and hide in a "dream," why not take a fatal dose like Schopenhauer and be done with it? In reality, as "humans," we lack both perseverance and cherish that extra life, so we inevitably become "fools." No matter how eloquent the arguments, they are just a bunch of excuses and nonsense!</p>
<p>Regarding reminiscing about the "past," what is commonly called "memory," Maeterlinck once praised it as "the greenhouse of our lifetime." We certainly cannot deny the warmth that "memory" gives us. However, if a person's precious life is only placed in the years of memory to quietly age and quietly die, then why bother to take a trip to this world? Chekhov, or an authoritative writer from the era of Imperial Russia, once shouted at us: "All memories are poisonous!" Maeterlinck, while sighing that the past is the greenhouse of our lifetime, also warns that it is also a dead city. "If, like a too passive and too superstitious worshiper, we lazily and silently satisfy ourselves with the beautiful, desolate ruins, then the more glorious and happy our past is, the more we should doubt it." In an essay entitled "The Past," this Belgian writer roared, "You rely too often on our tombs. You think you are recovering our life, courage, and love: but in fact, you are taking away our life, courage, and love." The fact is: if a person's life has only "sentimental" reminiscences of the past and "mourning," then this person can only be considered an insignificant person in the world, or at most just a flickering shadow.</p>
<p>Dreams and memories are stumbling blocks to us, and we should kick them away with one foot. Only to passionately love reality is our only path.</p>
<p>The great Gogol said: "We are not called into the world for festivals and banquets at all. We are here to fight, so we must never forget that we have entered the battlefield. There, and we cannot choose areas with less danger; we should, like a good warrior, throw everything we have into the place where the battle is most intense." These words move us greatly and give us good enlightenment and education. If a person can face reality squarely, struggle in reality, be determined and courageous, like our soldiers who are making heroic sacrifices in entire divisions, entire battalions, and entire regiments to defend our territory, even though they have "sacrificed," whether it is one year, ten years, or a hundred years, as the great Romain Rolland said in his eulogy to Gorky: "But the most beautiful and most sacred tomb is in our hearts."</p>

<p>— Le Huan</p>
<p>Several hours of special class — car top — car life, passed comfortably enough. When I woke up from my sleep, the car had stopped at a small station; the sun was rising in the sky, and the sky was full of colorful clouds, it was early morning.</p>
<p>"Creak... creak..." came a very slight vibration sound. The comrades were scattered around the station washing their faces, and no one paid attention to this sound.</p>
<p>The vibration sound gradually became clearer, and two black dots were discovered in the distant red glow; "It's a plane--" someone in the car shouted; the station was also sounding an alarm, and comrades with minor injuries were quickly scattering into the surrounding wheat fields. Only a few seriously injured comrades stayed safely in the carriages.</p>
<p>We first moved the briefcase down from the roof of the car, because it was too bulky, it was not convenient to run a long distance, so we hid under a large tree on the side about a hundred meters away from the station; a brother with a minor injury was calmly chewing on a large piece of bread nearby.</p>
<p>The plane gradually approached, circled once, and aimed at the station, but the surroundings were very empty, there were only a few half-empty trains lying silently, and the locomotive had already driven away when the alarm sounded.</p>
<p>It accelerated and swept over the railway, and two silver iron eggs hung down from a height. The iron eggs rubbed against the air and made a sharp hissing sound. We watched it come down until it was almost overhead before we closed our eyes tightly.</p>
<p>"Boom" the sound finally came; under the sound, we only felt many things falling on us, but they were not very heavy. The air was mixed with gunpowder and sand, and our nostrils were about to be blocked. It was impossible to open our eyes at all. After a few minutes, the peaceful station began to move again. We opened our eyes and saw the brother chewing on the large piece of bread in the gray fog, muttering to himself, pouting and brushing the mud and ash from the bowl of noodles. He seemed to regret that the mud and ash had ruined this bowl of good noodles.</p>
<p>Less than fifty meters away, a crowd of people was gathered. It was where the egg had landed. No one was killed or injured. It only broke a small tree. The disturber of peace gave people not worry, only anger.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, the car continued to move, but soon stopped again at Minquan Station. It was said that the wounded comrades were being given medicine. There was always one time every day, and we took this opportunity to go to the nearby town to replenish our stomachs.</p>
<p>The town was quite lively, and the shops seemed to be temporarily built; many people were selling things on the street. The sounds of cannons and machine guns were getting closer and closer, but they said they would rather die than leave their homes. Each family had one or several Mauser rifles, and they could rely on them to do something when they had the opportunity.</p>
<p>The time for changing the wounded comrades' medicine ended before eleven o'clock, and it was time to drive at noon again. We returned to the car and saw that three more "Overseas Chinese Relief Team" cars had been attached to the rear. More than ten young men and women around twenty years old were sitting and standing next to the car, wearing uniform uniforms with Red Cross armbands, led by a foreigner over forty years old. They were quite an active group.</p>
<p>We had the same idea, which was to immediately visit them in their car.</p>
<p>After explaining our purpose, the foreigner warmly welcomed us. He spoke fluent Chinese.</p>
<p>He grew up in Nanyang. His father was Chinese and his mother was British. Although he was an elderly person, his patriotic enthusiasm was no less than that of the average young person in his motherland. After the war began, he raised some funds in Nanyang and led more than ten enthusiastic young people studying there to the embrace of their motherland. The old gentleman introduced these young men and women, who were as young as us, one by one. We shook hands warmly and reported each other's previous experiences in an orderly manner. They could all speak fluent Chinese. The new friends showed emotions like old ones, and we were already on fire.</p>
<p>When it was about to start driving, they eagerly asked us to ride in the same car with them. We did not refuse and moved the boxes and luggage up; because the sun was so strong, we got into the ambulance.</p>
<p>"It's rare to ride in a car on a train!"</p>
<p>We talked and sang all the way until the car arrived at Kaifeng at night.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Impressions of a Mountain Trip (Continued) <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Li Jinming</p>
<p>We quickly arrived below Nantianmen. I noticed some huge rocks that looked like monsters sculpted by sculptors, with inscriptions by famous calligraphers on them. Some on the mountaintop were connected like tiles covering each other. Beside them, a giant egg-shaped rock suddenly jutted out from a crevice in the hillside, covering the road like a canopy. People passing underneath might feel a sense of danger, but we were used to this constant state. Because some people said that this suspended boulder had probably been like this for a thousand centuries, and had been like this since Nantianmen became a work of the Creator. However, in recent years, during the construction of the road, it was considered that there was a natural force that intentionally made it this shape.</p>
<p>At the foot of Nantianmen, beside the road, there was a small shack hidden among the thatched grass and short trees, where a tea-selling monk lived. This monk was noble and simple, wearing a patched kasaya, just like the owner of a restaurant beside a small post road, directly soliciting customers to drink tea.</p>
<p>We found that this monk was not clumsy. He used the exquisite stone pavilion beside the road. Behind the pavilion, the sound of a spring gurgled like beans scattering on glass. When the monk brought out the tea, he said:</p>
<p>"Good spring water! Good spring water, cold or hot as you like. Hot drinks replenish the spleen, cold drinks clear the stomach, nothing is not comprehensive. Young people drink it to strengthen their bones, middle-aged people drink it to increase their intelligence, and old people drink it to have boundless longevity. Good spring water!"</p>
<p>Da Peng thought that these words were only to solicit drinkers, but after the monk's denial, he led us to the stone well that the spring flowed through. The so-called stone well was just a clear, dust-free stone crevice, and the spring came down from above, emitting a faint sound, revealing a cool air. The monk pointed and said:</p>
<p>"Let me tell you, gentlemen, the poet-sage Du Fu of the Tang Dynasty came to visit Nanyue in his early years and stayed here. At that time, there was a small hermitage below Nantianmen, empty, and the poet-sage stayed there for almost four months. During these four months, he ate ferns and bracken, Xunzi and wild Artemisia; what he drank was the spring water from this ancient well. After drinking this spring water, within four months, he became younger, his appearance became ethereal, and his poor appearance changed. At that time, the monks living on the top of the mountain, (belonging to Taoism,) praised him and said, if you continue like this, you can become an immortal! Indeed, if Du Fu, the poet-sage, had made up his mind to continue, he could indeed have become an immortal. Du Fu, on the other hand, wanted to go down the mountain, unable to forget a post, a salary, and three sumptuous meals, and wandered to Leiyang, seeking friends in the east and asking acquaintances in the west, and was trapped in an inn, without eating for three days. Fortunately, the magistrate of Leiyang recognized him and rescued him; it is said that he had not even been mentioned for half a post, but he swelled to death after one meal."</p>
<p>We knew about the latter part of the story, but the former part became news.</p>
<p>The monk was kind, and his companions were only a white rooster and a dog. He took good care of the chicken, feeding it with rice, and drinking clear spring water. It lived a leisurely and proud life, challenging the canes that the guests were holding. But the dog was thin, with its tail between its legs, its face dull, eating sweet potatoes, sometimes taking a bite and humming "uh, uh" twice, and suddenly running down the mountain like a wisp of smoke, and after a while, running back disappointedly like a wisp of smoke, suddenly lying under the thatched hut.</p>
<p>"This guy is really serving the wrong master," said Er Peng. The monk smiled when he heard this.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Next to Nantianmen, there was also a nunnery. The nunnery was narrow, humble, gloomy, and a fat old nun around fifty years old was sitting at the door. When she saw young men, a kind of hoarse sound appeared in her throat when she talked.</p>
<p>Like Da Peng, I had some aversion to this kind of woman. They were too hypocritical, violating the conditions of life, and so arrogant and resigned, not acknowledging their own misfortunes. We hurriedly left this place and walked up further, taking advantage of the setting sun.</p>
<p>Obviously, the climate suddenly became cooler within this five-mile radius, and the wind howled. There were no trees, and the sound of the wind was so strong for some reason. The clouds under our feet were moving, and the scenery was obscured, like a splashed ink painting.</p>
<p>Looking up at Zhurong Peak from this area, it didn't feel great enough, bare, with only a few crag rocks as decoration. The Holy Emperor Temple was nailed to the tip of the rock, like a fly.</p>
<p>The steepness of the road made walking very painful. But this final stage of the advance represents the perseverance of a person living to sixty years old.</p>
<p>In an instant, we arrived at Shangfeng Temple. It was just screaming, because there was no shelter above, so it was screaming so hard, and if you closed your eyes, you would definitely find yourself in a place with towering waves.</p>
<p>As soon as we walked into the courtyard facing the gate, the monk in charge of reception came out. Because he found that we had not taken a sedan chair, his attitude became casual. He stood on the street and said loudly:</p>
<p>"You're here early! ... Your feet are swollen, right!"</p>

<h3 id="e127">Sexual Vigor Declines More Easily Due to Self-Inflicted Harm Than Due to Aging <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Sexual vigor is not only a necessity for safeguarding our lives but also an essential element for procreation and a happy life. Naturally, it should not be allowed to decline. However, when a person's sexual vigor is lost, their mental and physical state often exhibit signs of aging and decline, and their lifespan is likely to be precarious. Therefore, any early signs of weakened sexual vigor mark the beginning of a perilous state for that person's life. According to medical research, a person's sexual vigor declines more easily and more commonly due to their own lack of hygiene and self-inflicted harm than due to aging.</p>
<p>Sexual health is not only something men boast about but also something women admire. Wives who see their husbands' robust and lovable physique and normal sexual vigor are often alarmed when it is weakened by excessive indulgence and will remind him to cherish his body. Furthermore, many women who are very concerned about their husbands' energy are pained by the fact that their husbands depleted their energy through premarital self-abuse. Why is this? It is because it affects the love between them. A man whose sexual vigor is depleted can no longer stimulate a woman's heart, making her feel like a fish in water, enjoying herself. Imagine, wouldn't her heart be in turmoil?</p>
<p>Originally, a person's sexual desire should gradually decline only after the age of forty. However, if they have a history of masturbation, nocturnal emission, or promiscuous indulgence in their youth, they will suffer from kidney deficiency even in their youth. Treatment at this time should not be taken lightly or neglected. Based on my clinical experience, premature ejaculation, nocturnal emission, and infertility due to kidney deficiency are purely caused by the decreased function of the youth gland that governs sexual desire. Therefore, taking ordinary preparations or treatments that are not targeted is unlikely to be effective. Therefore, it is necessary to take the truly genuine German animal youth gland extract "Biokraft" for men to achieve significant results. This is because the ingredients of "Biokraft," in addition to brain-nourishing phosphorus, are entirely based on the essence of vigorous animal testicles. Taking it three times a day for three consecutive months will naturally replenish the brain and invigorate sexual vigor, achieving the goal of rejuvenation. Countless renowned kidney disease experts in Europe and America are aware of the definite efficacy of this preparation. It has miraculous effects in nourishing the brain, kidneys, and blood. The female "Biokraft" is a pure ovarian endocrine agent that aids in regulating menstruation and promoting fertility. Written by Dr. Yang Daonan of the Russian Laoda Medical School.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Summer Coughs <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Coughing is a common ailment in all seasons, but the danger of summer coughs is no less than that of other seasons. Because summer coughs are affected by the hot weather, our resistance is inevitably weakened, and latent tuberculosis germs in the lungs of patients with lung disease are activated due to the weakened resistance. If unrelenting coughing is added to this, the patient's body will find it even more difficult to endure. At this time, if one can take the "Pectosan," invented by Dr. Trome of Germany, coughs can be suppressed and phlegm resolved within three hours of taking it, protecting the health of the lungs. At the same time, on the other hand, "Pectosan" is also an effective medicine for treating lung diseases at the root. It can increase appetite and increase the patient's resistance. Therefore, lung patients can especially benefit from this medicine, achieving miraculous results.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Special Attention Should Be Paid to Restraint in Summer Due to the Abundance of Sensual Stimuli That Cause Nocturnal Emissions <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>In summer, because clothing is thin, sensual stimuli seem to come more easily. Young people with excessive sexual desire often cannot restrain themselves due to the surge of emotions. In this environment, many young people embark on the path of self-abuse. Once self-abuse begins, it easily becomes a habit. Before long, nocturnal emissions will occur. The continuous leakage of seminal fluid will inevitably lead to excessive depletion of the body, causing various symptoms of weakness, such as incomplete development, weak mind and memory, neurasthenia, tinnitus, palpitations, headaches, insomnia, and lower back pain. After marriage, it will lead to premature ejaculation, impotence, infertility, and other sufferings, creating various misfortunes in the family. Therefore, young people should be especially careful to maintain personal integrity. Those who suffer from the above-mentioned symptoms should pay special attention to the knowledge of summer health maintenance. At this time, one should first abstain from smoking and alcohol, rub the local area with cold water before going to bed, or take a warm sitz bath. One should clear the mind of desires, avoid evil thoughts, and take "Nais anti-seminal emission tablets" to effectively restrain the spermatorrhea. The weakness symptoms caused by excessive spermatorrhea can be cured with the testicular essence preparation "Biokraft" for men.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Treating Gonorrhea Requires Seriousness <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is a dangerous disease with a very poor prognosis. Therefore, treatment should be avoided with a perfunctory or playful attitude. Unfortunately, most gonorrhea patients are limited by their environment and finances. They lack the determination to treat the disease persistently and lack the financial means to do so, resulting in a situation where efforts often fail. This is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Therefore, gonorrhea patients must be serious in all aspects: choosing life, choosing treatment, and choosing medication. Only then can they avoid failure. Many gonorrhea patients are often mistreated without realizing it. I have encountered many cases of stubborn old leukorrhea in my clinical practice, and their course is due to the patient's own disregard for the vital issue of treatment.</p>
<p>However, even if a patient has the determination to treat seriously but lacks the wisdom to choose the treatment method carefully, they will inevitably be misled. For example, among gonorrhea oral medications, patients often believe in large, extravagant, and widely advertised gonorrhea medications that have not been recommended by doctors and take them indiscriminately. As a result, symptoms often worsen unexpectedly.</p>
<p>"Klinon" is a medicine invented by Dr. Peter of Germany with immense effort. It has been enthusiastically supported by doctors from various countries around the world, who have adopted it for clinical experimentation. As a result, it has achieved a maximum success rate of nearly 100%. It is now introduced by us doctors. Therefore, gonorrhea patients know to follow the instructions of doctors and take it.</p>
<p>"Klinon" invariably takes effect and has become the most authoritative effective medicine for gonorrhea in the world. For all types of gonorrhea in men and women, unless one takes "Klinon," I dare to assert that it can never be eradicated. If one takes "Klinon," I dare to guarantee its fundamental cure. However, the patient must strictly adhere to health maintenance and be determined to take this medicine to achieve this goal. If one only tries it superficially and does not follow the way of health maintenance, I am afraid that even the best medicine will be difficult to cure this stubborn disease—gonorrhea.</p>

<p>— Described by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Cunning gonococci invade the mucosa and blood like oil into flour, impossible to squeeze out.</p>
<p>It is necessary to surround and directly kill the bacteria based on scientific methods to eradicate them.</p>
<p>Everyone has this feeling: Which part of the urethra does the causative agent of gonorrhea and syphilis actually parasitize? Why is it that after using medical instruments and medications for washing for a long time, it has not been fundamentally resolved? Instead, it gets worse every day? This is completely unaware of the living and active conditions of gonococci in our bodies. Originally, gonococci are transmitted after unclean sexual intercourse. Initially, they only reside in one corner of the anterior urethra. This is the life of gonococci in the initial stage of acute gonorrhea. However, gonococci are originally bacteria that are good at burrowing. If they encounter bad oral medications, medical instrument surgery, or drug washing, which puncture the mucosa of the urethra, they will invade, which is no different from opening the door to invite thieves, which is more harmful than taking inferior drugs. It is good that in the case of acute gonorrhea, the urethral mucosa is stimulated to ache and swell. Even if medical instruments are not used for washing, I am still afraid that it will rot, let alone use rough and hard instruments to intensify it? If gonorrhea has turned into chronic gonorrhea, the gonococci have entered the blood and internal reproductive organs from the mucosa, and the local urethral washing method has a feeling that the whip is beyond reach. So to treat gonorrhea. It must be based on science. I always use German static electricity therapy and "Klinon" to make the local and systemic gonococci have nowhere to escape and be wiped out in one fell swoop. Because "Klinon" has the effect of making systemic cells exert anti-gonorrhea bactericidal effects and surround them. On the other hand, static electricity therapy is transmitted into the urethra, and its bactericidal power is thousands of times better than the local medical instrument washing method, and there is no danger of stabbing the urethral mucosa. Therefore, it is a superman treatment that is unanimously recognized by doctors. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 numbers will be sent for consultation every day, and each number will only cost five cents. And a copy of "The Complete Book of Sexually Transmitted Diseases" worth one yuan will be given.</p>

<p>The deduction of funds from the concession area has always been under the control of the Public Works Department. This is because the Zongli Yamen (Foreign Affairs Ministry) has clearly approved the matter of foreign merchant concessions. However, although the donations are large, they are not enough to cover all expenses. For major construction projects, it is necessary to raise loans and advances. Previously, it was discussed that land in the concession area, where houses are built, would be subject to a land tax in addition to the general tax on rent, etc., which would be collected according to the prosperity or desolation of the location per acre. Although the amount is extremely small, many of the landowners are scattered, solitary, and impoverished, earning their livelihood from this. Therefore, they jointly requested the review of the prefectural government of Chen Sima, who, after consultation with the consulates of various countries, approved its suspension.</p>

<p>Last night, when I passed through the South City, I saw that sky lanterns had been set up everywhere, shining like stars and the moon. When I asked my friends, I learned that it was initiated by Zhong Yingnan alone. Judging from the list of donors, there are about two hundred companies, ranging from monthly donations of hundreds of cash to monthly donations of fifty cash, each according to their wishes. Moreover, they openly swore that they would not harbor any intention of embezzlement, so people were happy to give and assist. Currently, the amount has been completed and is being managed by the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to show impartiality. From the North Jieqiao Bridge to the South Cang granary, it is said that Mr. Zhong is doing his best to complete the construction of sky lanterns for those who have not yet set them up.</p>

The previous notice, as Jiangxi Road and other places were not fully informed, so a short notice was posted again everywhere, the notice said:</p>

<h3 id="e135">Using Summer Vacation to Benefit Children - Summer Children's Club <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Yan</p>
<p>Starting from next week, schools will be holding exams, and by the end of this week, summer vacation will begin.</p>
<p>During the summer vacation, various summer schools take advantage of these hot four weeks to tutor students in some subjects. Speaking solely of children, organizations such as "Summer Children's Health Camps" during the summer vacation will also emerge in response to the situation. However, in terms of various fees, these "Health Camps" can only comfortably allow the children of middle-class families to spend this summer vacation. The children of general poor families simply cannot afford to participate!</p>
<p>Now, I would like to make a sincere recommendation for the poor children of this city: the "Summer Children's Club" specially held during the summer vacation.</p>
<p>This club has been established for more than twenty years, with locations all over the country, but it almost never charges children. Although some places charge five cents to two cents for book fees, this small fee will be returned at the end of the summer vacation. Therefore, the reason for charging five to two cents is only to prevent elementary school students from tearing the books.</p>
<p>Visiting Mr. Wu Li</p>
<p>Now, I will report to readers the details of my visit and the details of this type of "Summer Children's Club" in Shanghai this summer.</p>
<p>The organization that manages the National Summer Children's Club is the Chinese Christian Educational Association at Yuanmingyuan Road.</p>
<p>The person currently responsible for carrying out all the children's clubs is Mr. Wu Li, who is also one of the association's officers.</p>
<p>I talked to him for more than half an hour. Mr. Wu gave me many printed publications and told me many valuable materials.</p>
<p>He himself has contributed a lot to this children's club. He has newly compiled two volumes of readers and one volume of poems and one volume of clippings for the children's club. These are all textbooks for children's clubs in various places. These paintings are sold at cost and do not earn any money.</p>
<p>Thirty Locations This Year</p>
<p>The establishment of this association dates back to 1918, when Dr. Bowen, an American, first came to China. He first tried to run several summer children's clubs in Shanghai and later promoted them to various places.</p>
<p>Until last year, there were more than 16,000 summer children's clubs held in various provinces and regions, with more than 50,000 service personnel (all high school and junior high school students from church schools in various provinces and regions), and the total number of children joining the summer children's clubs reached more than 580,000. (This Dr. Bowen passed away in the United States in 1937, two years ago.)</p>
<p>Last summer vacation, there were 19 such children's clubs in Shanghai.</p>
<p>This summer vacation is coming soon, and the Educational Advancement Association has sent letters to churches in various places to hold summer children's clubs.</p>
<p>Although the exact number of locations decided to be held in Shanghai is not known, it is now known that the locations that have been decided to be held include Shanghai University, Soochow University, Zhijiang University, Tianan Church (Maicaquan), McTyeire School, All Saints Church (Lafayette Road), Moore Memorial Church, Qingxin Girls' Middle School, Peiwun Girls' Middle School, Qingxin Boys' Middle School, Huaien Church (Daxi Road), Xiude Elementary School (intersection of Card Road), St. Peter's Church (Avenue Avenue), Huizhong Middle School, etc. The planned number of locations is generally between twenty and thirty.</p>
<p>Club Locations in Guerrilla Areas</p>
<p>In addition to the concurrent continuation of events in various provinces and regions, events will continue to be held in various guerrilla areas. For example, guerrilla areas that have already sent letters applying to hold events include Nanjing, which has decided to hold 20 locations this year, accommodating 1,800 children; Hangzhou, which has decided to expand the campaign and increase the number of children's club locations; Tai'an, Shandong, which has decided to hold 100 locations this year. In addition, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places have also decided to continue to operate.</p>
<p>Mostly Poor Children</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the content of this summer children's club:</p>
<p>Of course, this is a children's summer school hosted by the church, but during the Anti-Japanese War, I don't think anyone can deny the efforts that religious people have made by going deep into the war zone for the Anti-Japanese War. The schools and summer children's clubs held in the current guerrilla areas must be run by the church. Otherwise, they will be restricted everywhere and cannot do anything at all.</p>
<p>The target audience for this summer children's club is generally poor children who have dropped out of school. (All the children in the Cader reception center last year received education at the Summer Children's Camp.) Before the summer vacation, they try to notify their families in the workers' and poor areas, so the children who sign up are very enthusiastic every time.</p>
<p>As they say well in a small booklet, "...In the hot summer, especially those poor children, either run around outside at will or stay locked up in their simple and narrow homes. If they can listen to stories in one place, do handicrafts, play together, and read together, isn't it like entering paradise?"</p>
<p>Curriculum Content</p>
<p>The opening date of this school is around July 10, which is after the start of the summer vacation. The length of the school year is four to six weeks. The class time is either in the morning or in the afternoon, with three hours of class time each day.</p>
<p>In addition to "religion," the subjects that students study generally include the following: literacy, singing, stories, hygiene, games, handicrafts, and service.</p>
<p>In the past, they paid special attention to civic training and telling anti-Japanese war stories. But now, civic training has been changed, and the component of anti-Japanese war stories is very small.</p>
<p>It is truly like entering heaven for ordinary poor children to be able to receive a little education at this time!</p>
<p>We hope that the schools (and even adult schools) established by the Educational Advancement Association and those established for poor children can be promoted to a long-term establishment in the future.</p>
<p>Because there are really too many illiterate adults and children in China!</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 12: A Beauty's Revenge Is Hard to Erase Sinful Obstacles; Love Talk by the Green Window, A Happy Marriage</p>
<p>That day, after Pan Peiying bid farewell to Yuan Shuwen, she returned home and couldn't sleep all night, truly overjoyed and unable to sleep. She decided to visit Zhao Letian in Xueyan Bridge tomorrow. Suddenly, she wondered if Zhao Letian was married or not? Thinking that she hadn't asked Yuan Shuwen just now. Then she thought that it seemed embarrassing to ask her, and she initially thought that I and Zhao Letian had already formed a conjugal relationship. Visiting Zhao Letian tomorrow and seeing his wife and children would be somewhat embarrassing. However, I have no other intention in going, only to express my feelings. Because of my initial cold reply, he was greatly angered and disappointed, but if I hadn't done that, his life would have been in immediate danger. Later, she decided to write to him to explain the truth, but she missed the opportunity. And she never saw his later two letters. After that, it was the news of his death. She still keeps the newspaper with the information about his death in battle and will definitely take it with her tomorrow to show him. What tormented her the most was that her will could not be clarified and Zhao Letian had already died. He thought that I had betrayed him and died with regret. Fortunately, he didn't die, and I can pour out the feelings pent up in my heart. As long as I explain it clearly and he can understand me, I will have no regrets. The next day, after eating lunch, she went to Xueyan Bridge. As expected, she found Zhao Letian's address upon inquiry. A small semi-Western-style house with a short iron gate outside. Inside the iron gate, various flowers and trees were planted. Pan Peiying gently pressed the doorbell button, and there was a chorus of dog barks inside. At this time, Peiying's heart was uneasy. She wondered if the person who opened the door would be a young woman or a child? Who knew that the person who came to open the door was an old man with white hair, wearing a white apron. He looked like a cook. There was also a white curly dog, which was barking at Peiying from the old man's feet. When the old man saw Peiying, he also looked very surprised and asked, "Who are you looking for?" Peiying said, "Is Mr. Zhao at home?" The old man looked her up and down again before slowly saying, "He's at home!" Peiying gave him a business card with only the three words "Pan Peiying" on it. The old man read the three words while opening the door and letting her in. He led her to a small room that seemed to be a reception room and asked her to sit down. When Peiying arrived in this room, she looked around randomly. First, she looked to see if there were any photos on the wall, either of him alone or a photo taken with someone else. She knew that there were not only no photos taken with other people, but there were not even any photos of him alone. (141)</p>
<h3 id="e137">"Three Women of the Metropolis" Impressions <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>"Broadway Musketeers"</p>
<p>Warner Bros. Production, Cathay Grand Theatre Screening</p>
<p>After watching "Three Women of the Metropolis," I was quite moved. The final scene, where Connie and Fay meet again at that small coffee shop for their annual get-together, while Isabelle has died, leaving behind a child, Judy, who unknowingly mimics adult behavior by throwing a cup into the fireplace. This taste of human bitterness made me feel a bit impulsive. The tangibility of friendship and the inexplicable feeling of vicissitudes of life filled my chest. Afterwards, thinking about it, I couldn't help but feel sad for my fragile heart and also couldn't help but smile bitterly at the cheap sympathy of the petty bourgeoisie. However, this is enough to prove that I can only write things like afterthoughts that are close to essays. Being too easily moved often affects the correctness of judging the object. Fortunately, what I am writing is precisely to express what a member of the audience feels about a certain film.</p>
<p>From the perspective of a petty bourgeois intellectual like myself, "Three Women of the Metropolis" has a very moving story with rich human touch: three women who are "extremely close" in an orphanage lose contact with each other after leaving the orphanage. One day, they discover in the newspaper that one of them has been detained for performing nude dances and needs to pay a fine of three hundred yuan to be released. So the other two go to rescue her without prior agreement. After she is released, they go together to a small cafe they used to frequent to sit and decide to meet here every year from now on. The second year, Isabelle (played by Margaret Lindsay) is divorced by her husband because of the seduction of a rascal. That rascal took away some of her savings and jewelry, and then borrowed a sum of money from a gangster, who eventually killed him. Isabelle and her daughter are also kidnapped, using this to extort her original husband. Because the news is urgent, they are also preparing to tear up the tickets and then escape far away. At this time, in order to save her daughter's life, Isabelle uses the newspaper with their photos on it to commit suicide by jumping off a building. When it's time for them to meet at that cafe again in the third year, there's only Connie and Fay and her daughter Judy.</p>
<p>The author uses a harmonious family to accompany this human-interest story, which is a clever technique. It makes us sympathize with the unfortunate Isabelle even more and writes her, who has turned to another pipa, as a "person" instead of a harlot (and this is also true of Fay, who performs nude dances), which is something our playwrights can learn from.</p>
<p>The main storyline is on Isabelle, and Margaret Lindsay's acting here is also excellent, but in the publicity, the so-called "Jane Hylton the Second" Ann Sheridan's vibrant sensuality is emphasized, which is really unfathomable. In fact, in terms of the play itself, the role played by Ann Sheridan is not decisive, and in terms of acting skills, Ann Sheridan is not as good as Margaret Lindsay. As for Connie, played by Marilyn Whilson, she is even more decisive.</p>
<p>In addition to "Three Women of the Metropolis," the acting skills of child star Jenny Jebbman should also be mentioned. She is younger than Shirley Temple and does not have Shirley's annoying precociousness. At least, she is indeed like a child. Perhaps this is exactly why I like her.</p>
<p>Margaret Lindsay and others are not first-class stars. The theatre authorities also treat this film as a "small film," but in good conscience, this is not a bad film, and even the director's skills are quite good.</p>

<h3 id="e139">The United Front of Dancers in the New York World's Fair <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Zhihua</p>
<p>Nudity issue sparks controversy</p>
<p>The main topic of the World's Fair recently held in New York City is "Creating a paradise for mankind and building the world of tomorrow," which lists many rare and beautiful things. In terms of entertainment, there are hundreds of programs of outstanding dramas, songs, music, and dances from the East and West, which are rotated daily. There is a large-scale collective dance competition, which is the center of appreciation, and will last for seven months. However, because there are too many participants in the competition, the performances are inevitably somewhat excessive. The conference authorities recently formed a supervisory department and ordered the dancers and female guides in New York City to not go too far in performing fancy dances at the venue and to cover more of their lower bodies to avoid causing bad feelings among tourists. Unexpectedly, this order suddenly caused an uproar in the art world. One faction believes that nude art is the purpose of this year's World's Fair; otherwise, why display marble statues of Venus, Cupid, and other gods in the venue? Another faction believes that there should be a distinction between static beauty and dynamic temptation. The dancers, on the pretext of maintaining their livelihoods, even organized the "All-American Nude Dancers United Front" to attack the conference authorities. Thirty famous dancers held their first "joint meeting" in the Cuban New Village in the World's Fair venue earlier this month. American newspapers competed to report the situation of the verbal battle at the meeting, saying that at the opening, the chairman, Cuban dancer Ms. Rochega Consara, delivered an impassioned speech saying: "Nude art is the theme of this year's World's Fair. The body without clothing fully expresses purity, beauty, and nature. The so-called bad feelings among tourists, I don't know what it is based on? Those who prohibit us from being nude must be decadent themselves and unable to look at our healthy bodies." Next, Ms. Eca Boge, a famous balloon dancer and director of the Beauty Association, spoke, saying that "any woman who just takes off her clothes cannot be considered a model; real talents must be rich in artistic cultivation." The crowd applauded and shouted wildly, and Ms. Boge also shouted the slogan "American nude artists unite!" For a time, the meeting was chaotic, and the chairman hurriedly struck the table with a small hammer, shouting "Order! Order!" After a short silence, Miss Kangde stood up and said: "Nudity is returning to nature and there is no crime to be said. May I ask whether we are selling sex or selling art! If we are repeatedly humiliated for no reason, our reputation will inevitably be swept away and we will be regarded as vulgar. Therefore, insisting on nudity is also maintaining art." At this time, the order was greatly disrupted again, and the chairman called for silence again. After a while, Miss Renee expressed her views, and she advocated issuing a declaration clearly supporting nude art. She said: "One day, we will thoroughly implement nudity and return to the natural and innocent world, but unfortunately it cannot be done now..." Speaking of this, photographers suddenly broke in, and the members ran around, preparing to take off their clothes for photos, and the conference announced its adjournment.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Comparative Views on Two Child Actors in the Old Capital: Hou Yulan and Li Yuru <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Master of Aiping Studio</p>
<p>Hou Yulan and Li Yuru are both top students of the drama school in the old capital. The art of the two students was once called Yu Liang, without distinction. The length of the two students is compared according to various aspects, which is not absolute. (Editor's note: Hou Yulan will arrive in Shanghai with Yan Jupeng and others on the 25th of this month, see this journal on the 17th for details)</p>
<p>(1) Appearance: The appearance of the two students is not very good, but Yulan is good at performing family tragedies, such as the play "Peacock Flies Southeast", which has been called a masterpiece. Yuru is very suitable for performing Huashan operas, because her figure is slender and her eyes are bright as pearls. It is not suitable to perform tragedies.</p>
<p>(2) Voice: The voices of the two students are very clear and bright, and it is impossible to distinguish who is better or worse. They can both imitate Cheng Yanqiu's singing style.</p>
<p>(3) Achievement: Since Zhao Jinrong, the pillar of the school, jumped out of the school, Yulan's drama skills have improved even more. The former has now been selected as the pillar of the school! Since she became famous, the drama code is either the main or the final at each internship performance, and there are very few times when she doesn't have a good time. I remember in April of this year, I received a letter from a friend. When Yulan's voice was dry, she stopped singing. Therefore, there were many people in the society who advocated the composer system of the theatre. After recovering her voice, the first performance of "Wang Baoshan" was at the theatre. As soon as the poster came out, it was sold out in less than two hours, and no less than hundreds of temporary benches were added. Yulan's drama skills are popular, which shows the general situation. It has been five years since she entered the school, and this year is her graduation period. All her experiences and achievements should be above Yuru's. Yuru has only been in school for three years. She has very little experience in performing plays, and can only be said to be chasing Yulan, and dare not say that she can compete with Yulan.</p>
<p>(4) Acting Style: Because Yuru is naturally too fat, she is not suitable for performing any serious acting style dramas, but only suitable for performing some small boudoir costumes. Yulan's work is delicate. In addition to performing heavy tragedies, she is also very good at portraying everyone's ladies when she occasionally performs in the costumes of everyone's ladies. This is where Yuru is not as good as Yulan.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Ou Shounan in the Disaster Relief Charity Performance <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Yutang</p>
<p>On the 27th of this month, a grand charity performance will be held at the Golden Grand Theatre, sponsored by the local Refugee Relief Association. The performers are all famous amateur actors from other places. The neatness of the lineup and the solidity of the drama codes are unprecedented. Among them, what will attract attention is Ou Shounan's complete "Banging the Heartless Husband."</p>
<p>According to Ou, he has lived in Beiping for a long time and is very fond of Pingju. He often visits Yaoqing's door and is very friendly with Beiping's famous amateur actors Yixiao Nantiansheng. He is deeply immersed in it and his art has made rapid progress. Later, he served in the Nanjing Railway Department and founded the Yousheng Society. Every performance was well received. His masterpieces "Spring and Autumn Match", "Proud Green", "Cosmic Edge", and "Farewell My Concubine" directly pursued Wanhua, and were always enjoyed by people in Beijing. Now, Fang Fuyu Chun, who is famous in Shanghai, has seen Wang Xichun and once studied under him. In the 25th year, he was transferred to the chief of the accounting department of the two roads. Yu Fang presided over the railway box office and urgently recruited him, and met Shanghailanders with the two plays "Spring and Autumn Match" and "Proud Green", which became a grand event in the amateur circle. This time, at the invitation of the Refugee Relief Association, today (18th) he will broadcast the female Jieqi at the Continental Radio Station, and invited Li Zaitian as the partner of Chong Gongdao. (According to Li Jun, he is a famous Jing ticket in Beiping, and he studied under Hou Xirui. He has a wide knowledge of the classics and is also good at ugly). He will also perform the entire "Banging the Heartless Husband" at the Golden Grand Theatre on the 28th, in addition to Li Jun as Jin Song, and has also asked Zhuang Xiaogu to partner with Mo Ji (according to Zhuang Jun, he was a famous Xiaosheng in the former Railway Box Office, and was famous for plays such as Feihushan and Jiaoguan at that time), which is said to be a perfect match. On the day of the play, as far as Yu knows, there are also Mr. Su Shaoqing's female disciple Fu Jun's "Fish Intestine Sword" and Mr. Zeng Xinqi, a famous amateur actor from Jiujiang, who is also performing "Empty City Plan", which is also a good play that must be listened to.</p>

<p>— Choucheng</p>
<p>The famous amateur actors of the Pingju group of the China Women's Mutual Aid Association broadcast on the radio station of the China-Western Pharmacy yesterday, advocating the abolition of the expenses for zongzi eaten during the Dragon Boat Festival to fund the specialized obstetrics and gynecology hospital and nursery attached to the Orphanage. Zhou Bangjun's daughter, Wen Ji, and female staff member Pu Canxiu, were responsible for the report. Ms. Wen Ji once served as a judge in the Ningbo Court and handled cases in a very serious manner. That night, she was full of smiles, shouting to all the ladies, grandmothers, and young ladies to save on expenses and generously donate to the Orphanage. Her comic feelings made the audience laugh. Ms. Li Shuqing and Ding Taifen sang "Female Jieqi" separately. Li sang a passage of Xipi Yuanban, which was quite sad and moving; Ding sang a passage of Erhuang Manban, with forceful words. Ms. Yan Yiqing and Miss Weichi sang "Sitting in the Palace" and "June Snow", which were excellent. Others, such as Miss Eight's "Baimenlou" and Ms. Fan Peifang's "Borrowing the East Wind", were all called identity, without any flaws, and when the nine-year-old Fang Dunfeng and Wen Bangjun's wife, the Green Shade Master, sang, the most people called to donate money. The little sister sang "Stabbing Tang", and her voice was initially dry, but later she sang more and more vigorously. Even a little Chen brother in the orphanage listened to it with relish and called to donate 40 copper coins, which he had accumulated in the past few months. Mrs. Zhou sang a section of "Li Qu Qin Tiao", which was unique. She was already in her 50s, but her voice was clear and crisp, like a chicken coming out of a valley, which was difficult and precious. Finally, the lawyer Tang Huiqun's wife and daughter sang the plays "South Heavenly Gate", "Meilong Town", "Cosmic Edge", and "Four Disks Mountain". The members of the association are all famous ladies in the boudoir, and they never socialize outside. This time, they are willing to go to the radio station to broadcast, which is unprecedented. It is heard that Miss Tang happened to be engaged on the day, and her family and guests did not leave, and many people called to support her, and the results were very good. Therefore, I wrote this news to the entertainment industry.</p>

<p>To the Editor: After reading the article "The Difficult Birth of Ah Q's True Story" in your publication on the 16th of this month, the investigation on the point of Baolian's withdrawal does not conform to the facts. The Baolian Troupe did not withdraw because the troupe was rehearsing a large play, so the actors could not spare time to participate in the rehearsal of "Ah Q's True Story". The corresponding letter is hereby issued to request a correction. Sincerely, the Preparatory Committee for the Charity Bazaar Performance of the Shanghai Amateur Drama Circle, June 17th.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Yaoqing and Liqing's Later Years Were Far Inferior to Fengqing's</p>
<p>As mentioned above, when Yaoqing was wealthy, Fengqing and his wife often heard gossip, dared to be angry but dared not speak. As Fengqing's economy became increasingly prosperous, Yaoqing had no extra income except to rely on teaching to maintain his livelihood. His husband and wife were also heavy smokers, and they always spent more than they earned every month. Seeing that the second room had tens of thousands of dollars deposited in the bank every time they went out, they couldn't help but feel a little envious. If the two parties had a good relationship in the past, they could of course help their brothers during the New Year and festivals, but they have always been like enemies, and although it is extremely difficult, they are embarrassed to open their mouths to them. Coincidentally, Feng Er obeyed his wife's orders. Even if he himself still remembered that his elder brother had promoted him in the past, he sometimes wanted to send a few dollars to the eldest room to subsidize expenses, but after hearing his wife's provocative words, he ignored it.</p>
<p>Yaoqing is also very elegant and has a lot of research on calligraphy, painting, and epigraphy. Because he likes to paint chrysanthemums the most, he is also known as Juchi. He has accumulated a lot of Han jade in his life, and his ability to identify them is also not weak. In the past, he originally wanted to teach Yanqiu so that he could rely on himself in his later years. Who knew that after Cheng became famous, he did not repay him in any way, so in a fit of anger, he taught all his abilities to Cheng Yuqing and his adopted son Youqing. But unfortunately, the two of them were all too bitter in appearance, and after performing a few times, the results were not very good. He himself realized that the current year is not the same as before. In the past, he and Chen Laofuzi Sun Yiyun relied on art, not on the beauty of their faces. Now, as long as the appearance is beautiful, they can earn a lot of money, so he later only accepted female apprentice Kun Jiao, and there were dozens of them before and after Xin Yanqiu, Zhang Guoyun, Du Liyun, etc., all of whom were considered Wang's disciples. In recent years, he himself does not teach in person, and Yuqing does all the work for him every day. Occasionally, he is happy, maybe he will talk about it himself. Fortunately, the people who study are determined to hang a name, and Yuqing has also obtained his true biography, so of course it is not much different. It's just that he is more than 60 years old and still makes a living from this, while his third brother Liqing sings odds and ends in various restaurants every day in his backpack. Their later years are all very different from Feng Er, who has money and children. The old supplier recalls the past, and I can't help but feel the feelings of today and yesterday! (41)</p>
<h3 id="e148">Laurel and Hardy Cooperate Again <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Xinliang</p>
<p>Foreign newspapers recently published a message about Laurel and Hardy cooperating again. Now I will translate and record it, and I believe it will be welcomed by readers.</p>
<p>After Hardy broke up with Laurel, he qualified with a man named Harry Augdon, but the film company was not very satisfied with Landon's acting skills, so it decided to reunite Laurel and let them cooperate in the performance. It is heard that Laurel has expressed his permission, and his first film will be "Aviators."</p>

<p>Chess Talk Discussion on the Title of Chess Endgame</p>
<p>The title of the endgame is originally to embellish the game situation and depict the expression of the chess situation. Therefore, the title must be closely related to the proposed game situation. For example, the names "Seven Stars Gathering" and "Thirteen Taibaos" in the Hundred Game Chess Spectrum are thousands of numbers matching each other, "Prestige Zhen Huayi" and "Three Please Zhuge" are closely related to the situation. However, in recent days, there have been false titles used as words, containing satire, or even vulgar words and slangs, arbitrarily attacking, and carefully examining the naming and the situation, which have nothing to do with each other, and have lost the meaning of studying art. In the future, I hope that all contributors will be careful not to follow suit, and I hope that those who are responsible for promoting will pay more attention, then the future of art has a vision.</p>
<p>Add the names of the gentlemen who missed answering correctly or changed four omissions in Knowing Yourself and Knowing the Enemy.</p>
