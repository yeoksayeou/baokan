<p>巴黎　聞德國因西綫法軍雲集、準備大舉進攻、故亟遺調援軍馳往西錢、據最近法國戰報稱、萊因與摩塞勒兩河間之陣綫、敵軍正在增援中、新兵有來自德國內地者、法國各報對於西境戰事、頗少評論、謂在戰事初期、不能遽望有多大之結果、因戰壕戰爭現方開始也、並謂、主要戰爭刻正在斯脫拉斯堡以西哈奇諾與盧森堡邊界之中間進行、該處西格斐與馬奇諾兩陣錢相距僅數公里、聞德軍已在西格斐陣錢着手防禦工事、至於波蘭陣地則波蘭軍現退守前已凖備之地位、正布置反攻、德方不獨未能達到一戰成功之目的、且感覺愈深入困難亦愈甚云、（八日路透電）</p>

<p>倫敦　英相張伯倫今日在下院陳述戰爭現狀時、詳叙英空軍空襲威廉哈文軍港事、謂英空軍對於該港外之德艦、加以甚勇敢之攻擊德國所謂之袖珍戰艦有一艘、至少中兩彈、英空軍攻擊之目標爲威廉哈文與基爾河口兩大軍港、此皆爲德國防禦最固之地、然防禦雖甚堅强、而英空軍竟往襲擊之、其勇敢精神極可稱讃、是日午後氣候不佳、視綫極劣、英空軍攻擊之最後階段、的在大雨中行之、在此種氣候中、欲達到其攻擊之目的、非具有高等駕駛技能者不爲功、英空軍竟能擊中敵方大戰艦、即此一端、可見英空軍在甚困難狀况下、進攻敵方堅强要點之能力、尙有一事須述及者、參加此役者大都在英空軍擴張以來即已入隊服務而受相當訓練者，其中並有來自海外自治領者云、</p>
<p>首相詳言空襲經過後、二黨領袖格林武聲稱、關於擊毀德艦事之報告、如當日即予公布、則更足使英國人民精神爲之一振云、首相答稱、渠非俟事實查明後、不欲發表任何情報、惟得此經騐後、將來當可改良爲之云、格林武稱、不問消息好吾、首相宣儘速使國人明瞭戰訊云、</p>
<p>首相繼稱、英空軍之轟炸機隊、上星期接連三夜在德國天空作廣大的偵察飛行、並在德國西部北部各處連魯爾在內、擲落告德國民衆書逾一千萬份、雖每决輒見敵方防禦設備全部發動、但未遇敵方戰鬥機、英機皆安然飛返原防、英國戰鬥機隊與海岸巡邏機隊亦極活動、戰鬥機隊自始即駐防地、無時不在準備中、海岸巡邏機隊亦從事在附近海而偵察、以期發見德潛艇而毀滅之云、</p>
<p>首相續稱、吾人現知在保障自由、使人生有生活價値之奮鬥中、吾人可依賴英帝國海外各部份之援助、各自治領出於自願、除爲擁護正義之道德力量所驅使外、未受任何强迫、今已相繼聲明、願與英政府合作、以維護彼等與英國人民同樣重視之主義云、</p>
<p>首相於詳述英船「雅典尼亞號被德潛艇不加警告遽行擊沉之情形後、謂除「雅典尼亞」號外、尙有其他商船亦遭德潛艇轟沉、的略計之、已有三叫艘之多、英國海軍部已立即採行對付辦法、英國驅遂艦等現已大爲活動、大批抵制潛艇之軍艦與護送艦、刻正迅速在調用中、海相邱吉爾近已向下院聲明、刻正設法儘速成立商輪護送制、此種保護方法、當然非在宣戰後不能實施、且布置一切亦費時間、惟下院可爲滿意者、此舉刻正以可能的最大速度積極爲之、截至今日止、被德潛艇攻擊之英船、大都在戰事未爆發時即巳駛入海中者、英國防禦組織、當然不能立即予以充分之保護、雖航業損失每週必有若干、而吾人必不可輕視航業所遭之威脅、惟覺下院與國人所可共慰者、英國海軍以其戰時應付此問題之經騐、及其最近發明察知潛艇所在與毀滅潛艇之方法、定能控制此種問題云、</p>
<p>首相末稱、余對於現方迅速完成之國內防務組織、今不能不稍有陳說、地方組織現正行使其職務、惟鄕區現尙感覺能以全部時間服務者之缺乏、燈火管制之實施頗堪滿意、每夜空軍之偵察、得察知燈火之是吾外洩、苟有犯者即可付懲、政府於上星期四日決定疏散學童與婦孺之計畫、付諸實施現已完成、不獨大都市即可遭空襲之其他區域皆已依此辦理、計婦孺之被遺入鄉間者、共的有一。四七五·〇〇〇人、學校將在鄕問儘速復開、各地方當局現正紛忙辦理照料兒童幸福及資助各家之慷慨收容遺散婦孺者之方法、</p>
<p>今日已準備醫院病床二十餘萬具、以防空襲時受傷者之用、輔助看護員加入民事看護後備隊、以便在醫院中與急救站中服務者、現達一萬一千餘人、惟曾受訓練之看護員與自願担任之輔助看護員現仍需要、多多益善、而能全日服務者需要允亟、醫生之應募服務於緊急醫藥救護隊者、的已達二千五百人、現每日尙有應募者、輔助救火隊已迅速動員、以全體言、進行頗好、救火隊無時不在準備出發中、僅就倫敦而言、救火皮帶車現有一千八百餘具隨時凖備、而在平時則僅有救火皮帶車的一百二十五具耳云（七日路透）</p>

<p>倫敦　情報部頃發表公報稱、英國空軍一隊、於本月四日飛往德國威廉哈芬及勃倫斯蒲德爾兩海軍根據地、轟炸該國軍艦、業已奏凱而歸、茲將其作戰經過、追紀於决、我國轟炸機一隊出發時、氣候雖甚惡劣、但因各駕駛員勇氣百倍、得奏偉大之成功、各機於夜間飛臨威廉哈芬港時因欲尋覓明確目標、飛行甚低、其首先予以襲擊者、乃一停泊於距岸數英里外之袖珍戰鬭艦、敵方被襲時、顯極慌張、我方各機、乃得從容下降、饗以巨型炸彈、當時各機飛行極低、甚至敵方損失情形、亦歷歷可辨、敵方其他軍艦及海岸砲隊、當即紛粉開放高射砲、向我國飛機轟擊、同時敵機亦升空迎戰、但我方沉着作戰、異常活耀、並直趨勃倫斯蒲德爾港、襲擊另一敵艦、旋即奏凱而歸、各駕駛員精神煥發、咸以初决打擊敵人爲榮、據海軍界觀察、此决空襲在未來海戰上、影響彌大、則以我方轟炸機所擊中者、均爲德國海軍中最精良之軍艦故也云、（七日哈瓦電）</p>
<p>柏林　外國方面盛傳、當英國轟炸機空襲威廉港時、德國袖珍艦「格尼森諾」號被其炸沉、海軍當局頃正式加以吾認、略謂該艦並未遭受敵機襲擊、一無損傷云、（八日海通電）</p>

<p>柏林　柏林地方報今晨刋載軍事評論家席蘭德上校對於德國進攻波蘭之軍事計劃、作一詳細之批評、據稱、九月一日德軍奉令進攻波蘭、但東綫有特殊之情形、企圖沿德波邊境全綫進攻、長驅直入、勢不可能、蓋以德國及其保護地與波蘭接壤之境、綿延二千一百公里、較之前次大戰之西綫、長三倍有餘、是以德軍决計擇重要之點進攻、而在其他各地、祇取守勢、以遏止波軍侵入德境爲戰略、查德軍進攻之出發點有三、即波默蘭尼亞、東普魯士、及西里西亞是也、</p>
<p>北路當然以保證但澤之安全、爲進攻主耍目的、由波默蘭尼亞進兵、並未取道前往但澤最近之路、而由南路進兵、向勃朗堡。庫爾姆·格勞登滋等推進、切斷走廊以北之大隊波蘭人馬九月四日、德軍在庫爾姆附近渡河、完成包園該方面波軍之形勢、並與由東普魯十侵入格勞登滋防禦圈之德軍、取得聯絡、</p>
<p>由南路進攻之德軍、右翼於第一日即抵達諾愛馬克·蘇克拉之綫、但其後遭遇波軍堅强抗戰、未能一鼓而下、至九月五日、始行肅淸殘敵、但此路戰事之中心點尙不在此、而在工業區之北方、波軍苦戰之後、一蹶不振、申斯托佐及西刺滋利沙等地均被德軍佔領、波軍在德軍機械化部隊追襲之下、逃避奔竄潰不成軍、德軍乃得深人腹地、由北包圍克拉科、</p>
<p>德軍佔領區域廣逾一百公里、德軍初步作戰目的已達到、至於更進一步之工作、完全擊破波蘭之抵抗力、亦已着手進行、走廊之北部既經包圍、而進攻波蘭南部之德軍、亦已迭獲勝利矣、（八日海通電）</p>

<p>倫教　法波兩國簽訂軍事互助議定書、規定簽的國一方不得單獨媾和或停戰之後、此間一般人咸極滿意、負責人士並謂、德國所用之策略、乃欲於擊敗波蘭之後、向英法兩國提議樹立持久的和平、德國所由迄未大舉轟炸英法兩國者、正因該國尙望勿將戰事範圍擴大、同時不欲關閉談判門戶、以冀犧牲波蘭而與英法妥協、但英國官方及輿論界對於德國此種策略、一致斥爲不可思議、並斷言其必歸失敗、加之波蘭在軍事上力量雖與德國大相懸殊、但其抗戰精神並不低弱、此層自亦不應予以忽視、又况波蘭即使不支、該國領土即使全部淪陷、英國政府仍決定賡續作戰、緣在德國對波用兵之前、一切妥協企圖嘗試已遍、皆歸失敗、誠如張伯倫於本月三日所云、惟有德國國社主義政府歸於傾覆、戰事始有結束之可能、因此今後不論發生何項事變、英國全國人士無不完全贊成政府既定方針而堅持到底云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>此一消息殆將使世人震驚於歐戰之際，更受强烈之刺激歟？誠以德義蘇日四國者各有其特殊之個性，逈殊於其他國家；德國與日本迄今爲侵略而在戰爭之中，義大利在阿比西尼亞與阿爾巴尼亞之血跡未乾，蘇聯至少曾爲德義日三國所視爲毒蛇猛獸；總之，皆不慊於世界現狀而各有超越本國國界之抱負者也。先有德義日三國之集團，近以蘇德彼此諒解而締結互不侵犯條的；若以方式推論之，則有德國爲之僑梁，自得斡旋義日與蘇聯之間，而使四國終於抗瀣一氣。四國各自發展，已使世界和平到處發生裂痕；四國而一氣，豈不將「天翻地覆，鬼哭神嚎」耶？顧以吾人觀之，決無其事。原電謂消息來源在德國，意者，德國宣傳家鑒於孤立作戰，人心容有不安，聊作指梅解渴之計乎？</p>
<p>試以德國爲中心，析觀國際。德國與義國爲同盟，與日本相提挈，而以反共爲共同之標榜。卒以德國本身迫切之需求，猝然化敵爲友，與蘇聯觀。察彼本意，豈絕義日；但事實所示，則因權衡利害而示人以雖絕義日在所不恤。如此轉變，幾使義日內政蒙其惡劣影響；義日纔受其愚，痛心疾首，謂仍將與德另締新盟乎？此就大體言之，凡屬德國之所策動，決非義日所願追隨也。何况所謂四國同盟者，以蘇聯爲盟國之一；遑論蘇義之間，有其扦格；是在日本，則根本上與蘇聯無妥協餘地。蘇日相處，以不相衝突而苟且相安，爲其最高度之邦交，若謂兩國乃得共患難，共陣綫，是謂爲違反人性之假想可也。日本何所期乎？蘇聯對於德國，由互不侵犯條的而更進一步，結爲軍事同盟；二根據同盟，蘇德携手作戰於歐洲；於是日本獲得最理想之機會矣。蓋英法對德宣戰之後，對日已趨軟化；若蘇聯更助德戰，則英法對日必更低首下心；日本於是堂皇其爲英法陣綫之健者，爲民治陣綫之健者，爲太平洋之健者，在遠東爲唯我獨尊之霸者！所期若此，謂願對抗英法，不避犧牲海軍，而與蘇德相盟耶？至於義大利：既以德國與蘇聯締結互不侵犯條的而不慊於德，復以德國用兵波蘭，引起歐戰，毅然擺脫其對德之義務而宣告中立；若謂更合蘇德而成四國同盟，則不惟於彼最近之中立政策爲逆轉、抑且四國同盟中之義國，在地利上，軍略上，將成爲首先『挨打』之犧牲者。是以義國即使與蘇德國交融洽，亦必不與相盟。至於蘇聯：在彼主義上，政治上，經濟上，軍略上，凡應視爲乘除得失之數量者，較他國爲複雜；故其政策進退，最難捉摸；亦即種種作爲，種種轉變，最多其不同之可能。即如目前，在歐戰之中，對於德波兩國之勝敗存亡，我人即未敢斷言於蘇聯終將取何政策。雖然，亦有可以簡單言之者，任何國家俱不願意從事戰爭，而蘇聯乃爲最不願意戰爭之國，是以此際締結四國同盟而遽爾躍入漩渦，爲蘇聯所不爲，此其一。即使在歐洲別有打算而參戰，亦非目前之事；况在遠東，至少無求於日本，亦無憚於日本，然則何爲締結四國同盟而受日本拘束，此其二。</p>
<p>綜上所述，可知所謂德義蘇日四國同盟者，僅為柏林之宣傳而已！</p>

<p>歐洲戰事給予中國抗戰之影響如何、深爲國際重視、而尤爲熱心愛國之華人所時刻懷念者、茲據某觀察家談稱、（一）中國地大物博、物產富庶、在二三百年以前、本一閉關自守之國家、其人民勤勞樸實、物質生活、極爲簡單、現內地僻陲之區、且尙保有此種狀態、</p>
<p>按之史例、凡農業國家受外圍環境之影響、必較工業國家爲輕微、以其習於簡樸之生活也、（二）中國現當進行抗戰之際、軍械及軍事用品之接濟爲第一要着、此爲賢明之中國當局所早見及此、</p>
<p>抗戰兩年來之努力、除重兵器外、通常軍械、亦已能達自給地步、沿海口岸、華人經營之較大藥廠、移內地者亦有多家、於救護工作、必有重大裨助、（三）土貨輸出、或將因歐戰蒙受若干影響、但另一方面外貨之</p>
<p>減少輸入、亦足抵銷一部、中國新工業、兩年來在內地已有可觀之成就、今後自必更獲得充分發展之機會、故歐洲戰局、無論若何演變、終無礙中國抗戰之地位、矧目前中國國際路綫、如對蘇聯·美國·等根本無如何之變更也、</p>

<p>中外現棉交易大量的巡展、趨勢異常熱鬧、此種悄形、全係世界戰爭開始、各國對於棉花為軍需品搜羅儲藏、因此歐美三大棉市一致飛騰、美棉來電忽跳七八十磅音、米特林現貨已漲至一角、終灶人心皮鹽、同業買意突兇興奮、在市購買、故成交增加、同行進白洛去棉一千件、價由一百四十一元半做起主一百五十元止、比上日價勗漲十元、同時華廠方而鑒於潮流如斯、意嚮亦改變、活動採辦英廠亦發展、咋、水安。榮豐英商統一。崇信等廠、共進印棉八百件、十支粗紗原料平果爾成交二百件、價比上日漲六元七角半、巴西棉漲八元、新通花漲八九元、惟日廠未曾舉動、棉市處此環境之下、廠方如活動採買、市價續有起色之望也、蘇北來源甚暢、碼歟上到通州花六百二十一包、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>

<h3 id="c116">說瞞 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 次愷</p>
<p>一般人特別喜歡做好事：看見討飯，給他銅板；看見打架，給他拆開；而在言辭之間，像「瞞」也是一個好例。老先生板着臉孔說：「不責人而責已，」「君子成人之美，不成人之惡。」大家熟知的朱子家訓裏似乎也有一句不稱人惡；甚至遠在春秋時代，孔子曾經很嚴重地指出「其父攘羊，而子證之」的子過，他說「父為子隱，子為父隱，直在其中矣！」可見瞞之由來遠矣哉。到了現在「瞞」更進化了！它儘可加入人生四大需要中成「衣」「食」「住」「行」「瞞」的五大需要；蓋世間有藉瞞而得面子者；有藉瞞而獲「進身」之階者，有專靠瞞而吃大菜住洋房坐汽車者。要之，瞞者至少可有飯吃，不曾餓死之戰，若伯夷叔齊見之，當羨慕死也？</p>
<p>雖然，我們也偶會碰到一二第一等呆人，因為兒子為盜，或兄弟做賊，搶了隔壁阿嫂的一只戒指，竊了對過阿四的幾個銅板，就公然聲明脫離關係；但世間如此呆人却罕見得很，就因為其少，所以也可把他們歸入「超聖人」之類。至如一般人，大槪都知道一些瞞學ABC，所以不會弄出如此傻事來，蓋你家人做賊，很有人願意替他「義瞞」，如再加你緘口一瞞，不費一兵一卒，即可安然了事。如患人家好事有限而偷者慾望無窮，終有一次連你家人都受連累，那末，你不妨用錢，用勢，這一來，非但家醜不致外揚，而人家見你有錢出錢，有勢出勢，慷慨如也，還可為你吹捧，頌揚！</p>
<p>同樣，我們旣然想做做好事，當然不僅替近人瞞瞞即可了事，且還可變本加厲，再替古人也瞞一下才好。使他們在黃泉之下，也可安然瞑目，因此流芳者有之，遺臭者却連一個都沒有。筆而成史，於是儘可一部一部公開到地球之外去：眞正光榮得很！誠然，「瞞史」一事，亦當然之急務也，——「堯舜治國，盜跖辦公」；「繼光與三桂齊名，寇凖共張松一氣」；看起來雖然有點狗屁不通，但只要有錢到手，狗屁也任他狗屁好了！</p>
<h3 id="c117">芭蕉塞 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 唐乃昌</p>
<p>從午崖的蠻綫到緬甸八募平原的小田壩，其間一共三天的路程，都是在野人山中。</p>
<p>與土司告辭，我們就放大着脚步，離開蠻綫街。正是上午八點鐘光景，午崖壩的落雨季剛過，二月不見的太陽，又掛在頭上。路旁的爛葉子，隱隱地發出一陣難堪的氣味。每個人的心裏，都似乎覺得旅行到那裏去，是多少含着些冒險性的。</p>
<p>但不久我們就走進山道了。</p>
<p>雜亂的羣峰，橫躺在滇緬界間，氣候和印度半島全然一樣。我們慢慢的在山中行着，豐盛的樹木和強烈的陽光，把這條紆　的山道，打扮得旣光明又翠綠。那修長的纏在大樹身上的藤子，墜着柔嫩的葉噘，愛撫着我們的頭髪。不知名的草木的清香，隨着輕微的山風，替人慇懃地拂掃着夾在峯間的長路。從樹疏處，我們瞭望去，遙峯擁着黛色的樹層，在淡藍的天幕上，繪着各樣娟秀的姿影；近處偶然可以看見一兩隻打開花色衣衫的孔雀，從綠玉般的葉海裏浮了出來，又迅速地沉落下去。我們走完了古爾卡之後。爬上另一個山巔，就看見了檳榔江，但因岡巒起伏着，有時雖然看見在峽中噴着白沫的江水，也看見在水中浴着野象，却也有時隔得遠遠的，連怒吼的聲音，亦竟至聽不到一些兒了。在中國領地內的一節路，顯得荒涼些，野草侍暗自拆上人的褲脚。</p>
<p>整天的，我們走着，沿途的山景，早趕路了我們心裏的恐懼心。每人默默的走着，有時為想起剛才那浮沿在綠葉叢中的孔雀，與從山巔望下去的峽中噴着白沫，眼前總像撩動着一塊五色幻布，雖然我們的脚在移動，但望不見一所烟火的人家。有時，鈴聲遠遠的搖曳過來，等到峯折路轉的當兒，馱着洋貨的馬隊，汗流氣喘地一匹匹出現，又帶着鈴聲響到遠山去了。我們都像獨個兒似的旅行在這野人山道中，感到空山的寂寞，與旅味的愴涼。</p>
<p>黃昏罩起了山路，夜神開始在那遙遙的山那邊，扯起黑幕，而我們却也走到了這小小的山谷，並且瞧見幾所蓋着芭蕉芒果的草屋頂，而那勾人飢餓的鮮藍的炊烟，也在入夜的迷濛天色中，縷縷地升起來，急性子的晚風，也在屋頂上打旋子。</p>
<p>每人歡快地呌起來，不用問，這當然就是芭蕉塞了。走到竹籬門前，碰見兩個腰上掛着長刀，嚼着檳榔的野人，那血樣的嘴盆，帶着骨溜溜的眸子，使我們大大地吃了一驚；然而，和我們的一樣臉孔的主人，已對着我們打了招呼。而那野人矯健的姿影，却已爬下山坡，沒入夜影森森的林莽裏去。</p>
<p>我們就停留下來，芭蕉塞正是這野人山谷裏的一爿最宜棲留的宿夜店啊。</p>
<p>走進屋子，大家都坐倒了，……在木盆子裏洗好足，吃了芒果與自備的乾糧，燃着枝烟，我們閉起眼睛想休息一下，可是那幾個多嘴的雲南客人，開口老鄉，閉口老鄉的同你搭白，我不耐煩的走出來；在屋外的馬塲上，有漢人馱洋貨的馬，擺夷人馱米的黃牛。他們都也在這塞裏宿夜，幾個管中和邀馬的人，在空地生野火。現在，外面漆黑，四面山黑黝黝的屹立着，猴子的呌噪，也漸漸地低微了。但，隔離這山谷很遼遠的檳榔江，却吼着宏大的濤聲。</p>
<p>我們矇矇的睡去，隱隱地還聽見擺夷人唱歌聲……半夜，有人動身，帶着手電筒，一股雪白的光芒，移向山坡去，馬塲裏的馬，牛，笨重地馱着，一匹匹，一隻隻的從木棚裏出來了。很刺眼，我們望着屋子外；雲南人擺夷，還有幾個帶盒子砲的兵士。</p>
<p>次日一早醒來，晴美的陽光，又罩着山谷，樹林裏有紅屁股的毛猴在竄跳，我們又要走了。主要帶着微笑，送我們走出店來，我忽然想起半夜里的事情，於是問他：</p>
<p>「這里也有穿武裝的兵士宿夜嗎？」　　「哦！近來多呢，」主人說：「他們都是輸送隊，一匹匹的馬，一隻隻的牛，馱着的都是好東西。」主人很快樂地笑起來。</p>
<p>於是，我明白過來：那些牛馬馱着的不再是洋貨與米糧；而這野人山谷中的芭蕉谷，召集也含有抗戰的意味了。</p>

<p>樺皮車轆轆轉聲輾在雪地，</p>
<p>雜色旗邋邋聲響在江邊，</p>
<p>那「郊寒島瘦」的山河臥在興安嶺，</p>
<p>那漁綱悼泣着江東六十四屯？</p>
<p>舊底春夢長存九月之天，</p>
<p>故城底殘蹟如脣齒之相依，</p>
<p>難道你就沒有了那種車票，</p>
<p>獨個兒徘徊着一年又一年。</p>
<p>為什麼你要流這烟花的南廓？</p>
<p>還暗暗地淌着思量的飯團？</p>
<p>却已好多年不戴你的貂帽？</p>
<p>我曾見你從雅克薩還高興地歸來，</p>

<h3 id="c120">潮與舵手 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>比日間添起幾尺新漲，山顯得矮，江顯得寬，夜深時嘩浪浪裂帛聲響，旋渦更急，水也東西流，人立江岸上，對岸茫茫，一片黑影朦朧，這時你感得生涯的不着邊際了。</p>
<p>水上的生涯容易使人感到孤獨，而江海的行旅也決不如陸上之有連鎖。好像歐文這麼說過，潮水會給水上的行程添一段距離的。心飄浮着邊際。狂暴的浪打擊着石頭，停泊岸邊的小走像搖籃顛簸。生涯的蕩動與絕緣，往往是一個懦夫的威脅。怕風，怕雨，怕波浪，怕潮汐，有許多舟子愛歌頌波平如鏡的晴明，航行的幼稚病需要好天氣。只有飽經風險的老舵手纔願意和可怕的潮汐抗爭。</p>
<p>幸福是人的希望，誰也願意永遠享受一份晴明。在人生的海上，永遠沒有風，沒有雨，沒有波浪，沒有潮汐。可是人生的路却又永遠是參差的；有晴明，有潮汐；有平凡。也有奇險。冒險時是痛苦，事後便成歡欣。人生是海，像晴明和潮汐，哀樂常相參差。假使不能返點牢一柄舵，船便會遭遇慘劇。暴雨狂風，扁舟一葉，這說明多少滅頂人的命運。</p>
<p>阻霾萬方，漸漸移向近海處。山雨欲來，不能忘記潮汐的來臨。萬人如海，海多戀幻，富想像和誇張。牠能吞沒生命，却也有勇敢和鎭靜能克服。別手慌脚忙，那祇是懦怯人的悲慘命運。</p>
<p>是一次亙古未有的巨大潮汐，每人躭心自身會埋葬，給滔滔海水。只要想像一下，潮汐之的驚駭，人撞着人，手指搔着頭髪，心懸半空中，街頭交接着耳語，誰也不能免除恐怖。躱避潮汐的人却祇是製造一層皮革，用外殻包裹身體。只有眞知的老舵手一聲不響，修繕好舵，視察一通船的週身，準備力量，應付未來的艱險。</p>
<p>我住過江城，目下也正僑居在一個濱海的都市；我知道潮汐。遲早有一日，牠會來，而且牠來時一定會吞沒許多弱者。躱避在皮袋中自然是傻，慌張也徒有岔事。</p>
<p>氣壓低，空氣悶，潮汛帶來消息。海邊島上呢，誰見指揮的老舵手。給利慾顛狂，織成的混合物是頹喪，脂粉和徼倖。</p>
<p>該知道不久的潮汛了，這人海中的怒潮，捎來一封近訊：中元前後的颶風。想來不久有一次更大潮汐，需要我們做好好的舵手。</p>

<p>平劇小生一工，以藝術立塲而論，殊屬重要，然今日小生人材異常缺乏，評劇者咸為慨歏，茲將一已之謬見，對現今各小生作一簡評。</p>
<p>（一）姜妙香—唱作念白上皆佳，嗓音或因年老之故，不如當年甜潤，妙香對於武功諸劇，不能多演，祇能演文小生，美中不足也。</p>
<p>（二）俞振飛—於崑曲夙有研究，人皆尊為曲聖，於皮黃則稍遜，在秋聲社與硯秋合作，頗收牡丹綠葉之效，自脫離秋聲社後，久未銅陵其露演矣！</p>

<p>笛師之子作市長</p>
<p>上面我所說的趙、王、袁、這幾位，當他們　的時候，也眞會用錢。戲班裏不說別人，只單拿李萬春講吧。彼時他才十幾歲，大家都覺得這孩子聰明伶俐。這些人全搶着要敢他作乾兒子，磕頭禮一賞就是一千兩千。當他們和狗肉將軍吃狗肉（卽推牌九）的當兒，不論誰推莊，要是贏了個三五十萬的時候，就隨便抓起一把鈔票莊票來向身後看閑的伶人手裏一塞，這一下子就許有個幾千幾百。所以我常說伶人身價之提高，和養成了他們驕奢淫佚等壞習慣的起因，就要以直魯時代為最初期了。後來長腿濟南遇害，多數名伶均為一掬同情之淚，那也是因為掙得他的錢太多了。</p>
<p>那一個時期，作官旣是那麼容易，所以笛師的兒子也竟然當了華北某市的市長。此人却曾卒業於北平某大學，因為臉子有相當的漂亮，又曾從王老供奉學過青衣，故而他和沈某都成了某少帥的狗皮捻子小朋友了。陳十二爺（彥衝）在世的時候，某年曾到關外去，有一天親眼看見他們鬧出許多惡作劇來。那時正值演堂會議，老伶工錢金福也由平出關，當時忽被少帥傳去，說你勾的臉譜有天下一品之稱，那末，這有個大臉請你勾一勾吧。一面說一面就命胡某把褲子褪下來，將那雪白的極胖的屁股露出來，讓金福勾繪。胡某先也不肯，但是因為要作官，也只好將臉藏起而以屁股示人了。（九六）</p>

<p>— 太白</p>
<p>陳鏗攝製「女子公寓」的時候，本來打算把「榮譽陣容」全部請上銀幕的，這計劃　是相當浩大的。但是事與願違，如夏霞是新華的演員，借演員的手續是很麻煩的；吳湄當時因為忙於「職婦」的慈善公演，也沒有時間，祇有藍蘭，傳威廉和也魯參加演出。不過在宣傳上，已經收了很大的效力，更加上路明，徐琴芳分演冠英和柳麗珠，「女子公寓」的陣容也相當整齊了。</p>
<p>藝華公司當局也非常重視這部電影，早已翊定在中秋節公映。可是在時間已迫的今天，據說「女子公寓」還有兩塲很重要的戲沒有動手，攝影塲上却反而忙着「王寶釧」的工作。本來，「王寶釧」也是藝華下大資本的巨製，為了張翠紅的王寶釧，曾使嚴幼祥奔波滬港之間，並且還有重金禮聘李綺年的傳說。所以，據一般推測，或許因為新華在中秋公映陳雲裳的「一夜皇后」，藝華也想以「王寶釧」來「古裝」對「古裝」這推測果然很有理由，但接近吳邨的朋友說，「王寶釧」中的趕一關，大登殿兩塲戲的劇本，現在還在趕寫之中，這樣看來，「王寶釧」要在中秋節上映也不是十分有把握的。</p>

<p>Paris - According to today's news, British troops have advanced to the front to reinforce French forces. A major battle on the Western Front is expected within 48 hours. Further news from the front indicates that French troops have penetrated seven or eight miles into German territory. (American Associated Press dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris - The Intelligence Office has announced that British land forces are steadily arriving in France to join our troops in combat. However, the exact number of British troops and their deployment locations will not be disclosed. "In any case, the assistance Britain can provide to our country is far more important than in 1914. At that time, German naval power was strong, and there were doubts about Britain's ability to maintain maritime hegemony. Now, that is no longer an issue." (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Paris - It is reported that Germany, facing a concentration of French troops on the Western Front and preparing for a large-scale offensive, is urgently deploying reinforcements to the Western Front. According to recent French war reports, the enemy is reinforcing its lines between the Rhine and Moselle rivers, with new troops coming from the German interior. French newspapers offer little comment on the Western Front, stating that significant results should not be expected in the early stages of the war, as trench warfare has just begun. They also state that the main war is currently taking place west of Strasbourg, between the Maginot and Siegfried Lines, which are only a few kilometers apart. It is reported that the Germans have begun defensive works on the Siegfried Line. As for the Polish front, Polish troops are retreating to pre-prepared positions, preparing for a counter-offensive. Germany has not only failed to achieve a decisive victory but feels that the deeper it goes, the greater the difficulties become. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris - Yesterday, the French-German border saw artillery battles throughout the day. French troops advanced through the German machine-gun nests in the forests toward Saarbrucken. According to news from the front last night, the German Carlsbrunn battery between Saarbrucken and Saarlautern was the area of heaviest fighting. Six hundred French tanks charged several miles into the German lines, and French troops subsequently occupied several mountain ridges. The French then used heavy artillery to attack strategic locations on roads and railways. The roads and railways between Saarbrucken and Saarlautern are all under fire, making German resupply difficult. As German reinforcements arrived at the border, trying to stop the French from entering the Saar region, the senior commanders of the British and French forces prepared to move the majority of the British troops who had already landed in France to the front. (American Associated Press dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris - After six divisions of the German army were transferred to the Western Front, they were attacked by French forces today. According to reports from the front, the German army is now actively counter-attacking, while the French are defending with 70-ton tanks equipped with 75mm guns. The French aim to advance on the German city of Neunkirchen. Heavy artillery battles raged last night. (American Associated Press dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris - This morning, French newspapers reported that the French army was making good progress against German positions in front of the Siegfried Line. Le Journal de Paris reported that the German army is currently holding strong positions in front of the Siegfried Line, and the French army is continuing to advance and put pressure on them. At the same time, the French air force is conducting reconnaissance flights, taking photographs of all enemy defenses. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Berlin - German high command issued a war report stating that German forces are now 50 kilometers from Warsaw. German forces in the southwest have reached a point 60 kilometers from the city. German forces advancing south of Warsaw in the mountains are 30 kilometers from Radom, an important transportation hub. Capturing this town would allow a direct advance on Warsaw. To the north of Warsaw, German forces have crossed the Narew River, a tributary of the Vistula River. Before the World War, the Russians had built strong defenses along this river.

<h3 id="e2">British Prime Minister Reports to the House of Commons; Air Force Bombs German Ports; At Least One German Pocket Battleship Hit; London's Air Defense Organization Strives for Perfection <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>London - Today, British Prime Minister Chamberlain, in a statement to the House of Commons on the current state of the war, described in detail the British Air Force's air raid on the Wilhelmshaven naval port. He said that the British Air Force carried out a very brave attack on German ships outside the port. One of the German so-called pocket battleships was hit by at least two bombs. The British Air Force's targets were the two major naval ports of Wilhelmshaven and the Kiel estuary, both of which are heavily defended by Germany. However, despite the strong defenses, the British Air Force attacked them, and their brave spirit is highly commendable. The weather was poor that afternoon, and visibility was extremely poor. The final stage of the British Air Force's attack took place in heavy rain. Achieving the objectives of the attack in such weather required highly skilled pilots. The fact that the British Air Force was able to hit the enemy's large battleships shows its ability to attack strong enemy positions under very difficult circumstances. One more thing must be mentioned: most of those who participated in this operation had enlisted and received considerable training since the expansion of the British Air Force, including some from overseas dominions.</p>
<p>After the Prime Minister detailed the air raid, the leader of the two parties, Greenwood, said that if the report on the destruction of the German warship had been released that day, it would have further boosted the morale of the British people. The Prime Minister replied that he did not want to release any information until the facts had been verified, but that he would improve in the future after gaining this experience. Greenwood said that regardless of whether the news was good or bad, the Prime Minister should inform the people of the war news as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister continued that the British Air Force's bomber squadrons had carried out extensive reconnaissance flights over German skies for three consecutive nights last week, dropping more than ten million leaflets addressed to the German people throughout western and northern Germany, including the Ruhr. Although the enemy's defense equipment was fully activated each time, no enemy fighters were encountered, and the British planes returned safely to their original defenses. The British fighter squadrons and coastal patrol squadrons are also very active. The fighter squadrons have been stationed from the beginning and are always prepared. Coastal patrol squadrons are also engaged in reconnaissance in the nearby sea in order to discover and destroy German submarines.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister continued that we now know that in the struggle to protect freedom and make life worthwhile, we can rely on the assistance of the overseas parts of the British Empire. The dominions, of their own free will, driven by the moral force of upholding justice, have not been subjected to any coercion. They have successively declared their willingness to cooperate with the British government to defend the principles that they and the British people value equally.</p>
<p>After detailing the circumstances of the British ship "Athenia" being sunk by a German submarine without warning, the Prime Minister said that in addition to the "Athenia", other merchant ships had also been sunk by German submarines. In total, there have been about three ships. The British Admiralty has immediately taken measures to deal with the situation. British destroyers and other ships are now very active, and a large number of anti-submarine warships and escort ships are being rapidly deployed. First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill recently stated to the House of Commons that he is trying to establish a merchant ship escort system as soon as possible. This type of protection method, of course, cannot be implemented before the declaration of war, and it takes time to arrange everything. However, the House of Commons can be satisfied that this measure is being actively pursued at the greatest possible speed. To date, most of the British ships attacked by German submarines had already set sail before the outbreak of the war. The British defense organization, of course, cannot immediately provide them with adequate protection. Although there will inevitably be some losses to shipping each week, we must not underestimate the threat to shipping. However, what the House of Commons and the people can take comfort in is that the British Navy, with its wartime experience in dealing with this problem, and its recent inventions to detect and destroy submarines, will be able to control this problem.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister concluded by saying that he must say something about the domestic defense organization, which is now being rapidly completed. Local organizations are now performing their duties, but rural areas still feel the lack of those who can serve full-time. The implementation of the blackout is quite satisfactory. Air Force reconnaissance every night can detect whether lights are leaking, and offenders can be punished. The government decided on Thursday of last week to implement the plan to evacuate schoolchildren and women and children, and it has now been completed. Not only large cities, but also other areas that may be subject to air raids, have followed suit. A total of 1,475,000 women and children have been evacuated to the countryside. Schools will be reopened in the countryside as soon as possible. Local authorities are now busy dealing with how to take care of the well-being of children and generously assist families who have taken in the evacuated women and children.</p>
<p>Today, more than 200,000 hospital beds have been prepared to treat those injured in air raids. Auxiliary nurses have joined the Civil Nursing Reserve to serve in hospitals and first-aid stations, now totaling more than 11,000. However, trained nurses and volunteer auxiliary nurses are still needed, and the more the better, and those who can serve full-time are in urgent need. The number of doctors who have volunteered to serve in emergency medical rescue teams has reached 2,500, and there are still volunteers every day. Auxiliary fire brigades have been rapidly mobilized. On the whole, progress is quite good. Fire brigades are always ready to go. In London alone, there are now more than 1,800 fire engine belts ready at any time, compared to only 125 fire engine belts in peacetime. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<p>London - The Information Department has recently released a communiqué stating that a squadron of the British Air Force flew to the German naval bases of Wilhelmshaven and Brunsbüttel on the 4th of this month, and bombed German warships, and returned in triumph. The course of their operations is recorded in detail as follows: When the squadron of our bombers set off, although the weather was very bad, the pilots were full of courage and achieved great success. When the planes flew over Wilhelmshaven harbor at night, they flew very low in order to find clear targets. The first target was a pocket battleship anchored a few miles offshore. The enemy was obviously very panicked when attacked, and our planes were able to descend calmly and bombard them with large bombs. The planes were flying so low that even the enemy's losses could be clearly seen. The enemy's other warships and coastal batteries immediately opened fire with anti-aircraft guns, bombarding our planes. At the same time, enemy planes also took off to engage. However, our side operated calmly and was exceptionally active, and went straight to the port of Brunsbüttel to attack another enemy ship, and then returned in triumph. The pilots were in high spirits and all were proud of their first strike against the enemy. According to naval observers, this air raid will have a great impact on future naval warfare, because the targets hit by our bombers were all the most elite warships in the German navy. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Foreign sources have widely reported that when British bombers attacked Wilhelmshaven, the German pocket battleship "Gneisenau" was sunk. Naval authorities have officially denied this, saying that the ship was not attacked by enemy aircraft and was not damaged. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Famous French Journalist Discusses the Western Front War <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Paris - The famous journalist Maurice recently commented on the situation of the war between France and Germany in Le Petit Parisien, saying, "The two sides have made contact between the Rhine and Moselle rivers. The evening before yesterday and all day yesterday were very active. After continuous pressure from our army, the enemy is now gathering fresh troops to strengthen their positions. Our army fought fiercely with the enemy for 24 hours, and finally advanced to a new line and consolidated it. However, because the enemy resisted stubbornly, our army was unable to make substantial progress. At the same time, the Supreme Command is reluctant to spend too much manpower and is being cautious." Recalling the beginning of the First European War in 1914, both sides were conducting mobile warfare, but now they are conducting positional warfare. This tactic may be extended for a considerable period of time. "As for defensive works, our Maginot Line is often regarded as an impregnable wall, and so is the enemy's Siegfried Line. However, Germany's western fortifications were built hastily in the shortest possible time, while we have spent years on them. As our country's famous military experts said, the Siegfried Line may not be without weaknesses. The 'work' that various units of our army have been carrying out for several days is to discover these weaknesses in order to plan for an advance. For this reason, we cannot expect the military authorities to issue war reports that are entirely the same as those at the beginning of the last European War. Our military authorities are difficult to achieve great achievements before they have investigated all the possibilities. In our view, the cornerstone of the Rhine front is the Lotbourg area, which is the 'defensive fortifications chain' to the south of that place. As for the terrain between the Rhine River and Wissembourg, the eastern bank of the river is very long, preceded by the Moses Forest, followed by the wilderness forest, and then followed by the wilderness (this wilderness is near the Lauter River, south of the French border). Furthermore, to the southwest, preceded by some small forests, followed by the wilderness. Hills, the French villages of Schebenhardt, Montel Forest, and Wissembourg Forest. Also, between Lotbourg and Wissembourg, the Lauter River is the boundary, with the western bank of the river being the French border and the eastern bank being German territory. On the German side, starting from New Lotbourg, passing through a wilderness, and reaching the extensive Bienwald Forest, it is indeed a good battlefield. It is reported that our troops have entered this forest, and the highway from Schweighofen to Schebenhardt winds outside the forest near the Lauter River (in German territory). Accordingly, the area between Lotbourg and Wissembourg will become the main battlefield in the future. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e5">German Military Scholar Comments on the Plan to Invade Poland; Explains the Reasons for Not Being Able to Drive Straight In; Says Preliminary Operational Objectives Have Been Achieved <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Berlin - The Berlin local newspapers this morning published a detailed critique by Colonel Xylander, a military commentator, on the German military plan for the invasion of Poland. According to the report, the German army was ordered to invade Poland on September 1, but there were special circumstances on the Eastern Front. Attempting to drive straight in along the entire length of the German-Polish border was impossible, because the border between Germany and its protectorates and Poland stretched for 2,100 kilometers, more than three times the length of the Western Front in the previous war. Therefore, the German army decided to attack at important points, while taking a defensive posture in other areas to prevent Polish forces from invading German territory as a strategy. There were three starting points for the German attack: Pomerania, East Prussia, and Silesia.</p>
<p>The northern route naturally aimed to ensure the safety of Danzig as the main objective of the attack. The advance from Pomerania did not take the shortest route to Danzig, but advanced from the southern route, pushing towards Bromberg, Kulm, Graudenz, etc., cutting off the large Polish forces north of the corridor. On September 4, the German army crossed the river near Kulm, completing the encirclement of the Polish forces in that area, and made contact with the German forces that had invaded the Graudenz defensive circle from East Prussia.</p>
<p>The right wing of the German army advancing from the southern route reached the line of Neuemarik-Sukra on the first day, but subsequently encountered strong resistance from the Polish army and failed to take it in one fell swoop. It was not until September 5 that they cleared the remaining enemy forces. However, the center of the war on this route was not here, but north of the industrial area. After fierce fighting, the Polish army collapsed. Schenstochau and Silesia were occupied by the German army. Under the pursuit of the German mechanized units, the Polish army fled in disarray and collapsed. The German army was able to penetrate deep into the interior and encircle Krakow from the north.</p>
<p>The German army occupied an area of more than 100 kilometers. The preliminary operational objectives of the German army have been achieved. As for the further work of completely defeating Polish resistance, it has also begun. The north of the corridor has been encircled, and the German army attacking southern Poland has also won repeated victories. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>Paris - British Chief of the General Staff General Ironside and Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Newall recently visited French Commander-in-Chief General Gamelin to hold talks. French Chief of Staff of the Air Force General Vuillemin was also present. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Britain and France Plan to Implement Established Policies; Polish Resistance is Strong; German Strategy is Bound to Fail <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>London - The fact that France and Poland signed a military mutual assistance agreement, stipulating that neither signatory could independently make peace or cease-fire, is generally very satisfactory here. Responsible individuals also said that the strategy used by Germany was to propose the establishment of lasting peace to Britain and France after defeating Poland. The reason why Germany has not launched large-scale bombing of Britain and France is precisely because it still hopes not to expand the scope of the war, and at the same time does not want to close the door to negotiations, hoping to sacrifice Poland to reach a compromise with Britain and France. However, British officials and public opinion unanimously denounced this strategy as inconceivable, and asserted that it was bound to fail. In addition, although Poland's military strength is far less than that of Germany, its spirit of resistance is not weak, and this should not be ignored. Moreover, even if Poland is defeated and all of its territory is lost, the British government has decided to continue the war, because all attempts at compromise before Germany used force against Poland have been tried and failed. As Chamberlain said on the 3rd of this month, only when the German National Socialist government collapses can the war end. Therefore, no matter what happens in the future, people all over the UK fully support the government's established policies and persevere to the end. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e8">The Theory of the Four-Power Alliance of Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that Reuters had dispatched a telegram from the Danish capital, stating:</p>
<p>"The newspapers there published a news item in large print, stating that a new axis is being organized, with Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan working together, and Berlin is in charge. To achieve this goal, a Soviet military mission has been in Berlin since Sunday to discuss matters. An Italian military mission is expected to arrive in Berlin soon. And negotiations between the Soviet Union and Japan to conclude a non-aggression pact are also beginning at the same time as this activity." This news is said to have been released by the German side.</p>
<p>Will this news shock the world even more amidst the European war and receive a strong stimulus? Indeed, the four countries of Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan each have their own special personalities, very different from other countries. Germany and Japan are currently at war for aggression, the bloodstains of Italy in Abyssinia and Albania have not yet dried, and the Soviet Union has at least been regarded as a poisonous snake by Germany, Italy, and Japan. In short, all are dissatisfied with the current world situation and have ambitions to transcend their national borders. First, there was the group of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and recently, the Soviet Union and Germany understood each other and concluded a non-aggression pact. If we deduce from this, then Germany is the bridge, and it can naturally mediate between Italy, Japan, and the Soviet Union, and finally make the four countries unite. The independent development of the four countries has caused cracks in world peace everywhere; if the four countries become one, wouldn't it "turn the world upside down and make the ghosts cry"? But in our view, it will never happen. The original telegram said that the source of the news was in Germany, which means that German propagandists, seeing isolated operations, may have uneasiness in their hearts, and are just trying to quench their thirst by pointing to plums?</p>
<p>Let us take Germany as the center and analyze the international situation. Germany and Italy are allies, and are on par with Japan, and they have been using anti-communism as a common banner. In the end, Germany itself abruptly turned enemies into friends due to its urgent needs and observed the Soviet Union. In its original intention, how could it sever Italy and Japan; but the facts show that it weighs the pros and cons and shows people that it does not care even if it severs Italy and Japan. Such a change has almost caused Italy and Japan to suffer adversely in their domestic affairs; Italy and Japan have just been fooled by it, and they are in pain and say that they will still form a new alliance with Germany? Generally speaking, anything that Germany plans will not be followed by Italy and Japan. What's more, the so-called four-power alliance has the Soviet Union as one of its allies; let alone that there are obstacles between the Soviet Union and Italy; as for Japan, there is fundamentally no room for compromise with the Soviet Union. The highest degree of friendship between the Soviet Union and Japan is to get along without conflict and to live in peace for the time being. If we say that the two countries can share weal and woe and fight on the same front, it is a hypothetical that violates human nature. What does Japan expect? The Soviet Union, from a non-aggression pact with Germany, has moved further to form a military alliance; according to the alliance, the Soviet Union and Germany will join hands to fight in Europe; then Japan has the most ideal opportunity. After Britain and France declared war on Germany, they have softened towards Japan; if the Soviet Union further assists Germany in the war, then Britain and France will definitely bow their heads to Japan even more; then Japan will be able to stand tall as a strongman in the British-French front, as a strongman in the democratic front, as a strongman in the Pacific, and as the only dominant power in the Far East! If it expects this, would it be willing to confront Britain and France, not avoiding sacrificing its navy, and ally with the Soviet Union and Germany? As for Italy: it has been displeased with Germany since Germany and the Soviet Union concluded a non-aggression pact, and after Germany used troops in Poland, causing the European war, it resolutely abandoned its obligations to Germany and declared neutrality; if it is said that it will further join the Soviet Union and Germany to form a four-power alliance, then it will not only reverse its recent neutrality policy, but also Italy in the four-power alliance will become the first sacrifice to be 'beaten' in terms of geography and military strategy. Therefore, even if Italy's relations with the Soviet Union and Germany are harmonious, it will not ally with them. As for the Soviet Union: in its ideology, politics, economy, and military strategy, the quantities that should be regarded as gains and losses are more complex than other countries; therefore, its policy advances and retreats are the most difficult to grasp; that is to say, there are the most different possibilities in various actions and various changes. Even at present, in the European war, we dare not say what policy the Soviet Union will ultimately take regarding the victory or defeat and survival of Germany and Poland. However, there is also something that can be said simply: no country wants to engage in war, and the Soviet Union is the country that least wants war, so it is not something that the Soviet Union would do to conclude a four-power alliance at this time and jump into the vortex suddenly, this is the first reason. Even if it has other plans in Europe and participates in the war, it is not a matter for the moment; moreover, in the Far East, it has at least no needs from Japan and is not afraid of Japan, so why would it conclude a four-power alliance and be bound by Japan, this is the second reason.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that the so-called four-power alliance of Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan is only propaganda from Berlin!</p>

The "Innean" was captured on Tuesday, but British soldiers were unable to board her before the crew scuttled the ship. A recent British naval communiqué stated that the British Navy has no major actions to report, but continues to attack German submarines, with at least one apparent success. German submarines are attacking merchant ships everywhere. British losses include the Bosnia (2,401 tons) and the Kingsway (48,512 tons). The Corinthia was attacked but undamaged and has reached port. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>Lisbon, The British ship "Manees" was sunk by a German submarine at 5:30 AM on Wednesday, eighty miles from Cape Roca. The Dutch ship "Maas" arrived here yesterday, carrying rescued passengers, among others. Forty-two of the eighty-eight crew members are still missing. Also, according to official news from London, the British ship "Kingsway" was also sunk by a submarine. The British ship "Olive Grove" also sent out a distress signal, and the American ship "Washington," which was in the English Channel, has sailed to assist. Rescued passengers from the "Manees" said that the ship was attacked suddenly without warning, and the crew had no choice but to abandon ship and escape in lifeboats. The German submarine then surfaced and opened fire on the ship, sinking it. An Indian seaman was killed by a bullet. Two of the sixteen passengers rescued by the Portuguese ship "Carvalho" were also wounded by bullets. The Dutch ship "Maas" rescued passengers from three lifeboats. The "Maas" now has, in addition to the rescued passengers, the bodies of three drowned crew members and one passenger. The rescued passengers are in terrible condition, their clothes torn, and they are all hungry and thirsty. The "Manees" weighed 7,242 tons and was built in Liverpool. The British ship "Cordelia" was also attacked by a German submarine but escaped safely and arrived in British territorial waters. Reports from New York stated that the British clipper ship of Transamerica Corporation reported seeing two submarines of unknown nationality five miles from the Azores. As of today, 128 passengers from the "Athenia" are still missing, and hopes for their survival are extremely slim. The American ambassador to Britain, Kennedy, has sent his son, Joseph Kennedy, to assist American rescued passengers. The Red Cross has allocated $10,000 for rescue efforts, and the US government has sent a ship to the River Clyde to meet them. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>

When reporters asked about the situation of the ship, the spokesperson said that he did not have any special information about the "Scharnhorst" and said that he had heard that several German ships were docked in Japanese ports. The spokesperson also said that he had not heard of the rumors that Japanese shipowners had negotiated with the German ship owners to transfer ownership. The truth of this matter needs to be carefully considered, but he believes that there may be legitimate reasons for transferring ownership in some cases. Some reporters also asked whether it was true that the "Scharnhorst" could be converted into a warship. The spokesperson replied that he had not heard of such a step. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>Washington, Six American submarines currently docked at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii are likely to sail to Manila in the Far East within two months, and the State Department has confirmed this news. According to American government authorities, they announced to reporters yesterday that the aircraft carrier "Langley" in Pearl Harbor has been ordered to rush to Manila to strengthen the strength of the Asian Fleet. According to the Navy Department, they had planned to send six submarines to the Far East for defense a year ago, and said that this new order aims only to replace unusable old ships, so this transfer is purely a "normal" situation, and would not have attracted attention if not for the current special international situation. However, when the order to transfer the "Langley" was announced, the Navy admitted that its purpose was to protect the harbors of the Philippines, because since President Roosevelt expressed his attitude towards Europe, the neutrality of the area needs to be ensured. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington, It is learned that the Joint Committee of the US Army and Navy has drafted a mobilization plan, which will be able to conscript one million men within ninety days once involved in the war. According to the national census, there are 41 million men between the ages of 18 and 64, and approximately 26 million between the ages of 18 and 45. Reservists from the ages of 21 to 30 have been designated as the first batch to enlist. The second batch is from 18 to 20, and the third batch is from 31 to 40. If this plan is implemented, men from the ages of 18 to 46 must register at recruiting stations within three days of the outbreak of war. As for the personnel to be enlisted, it will be decided by lottery. The US Army and Navy are currently intensifying conscription work, because according to peacetime arrangements, the total number of army personnel should be 202,000, and the navy 80,000. In addition, officials do not attach much importance to the rumors that Congress will hold a special meeting to discuss the national defense supplementary plan. They believe that President Roosevelt may not intend to expand the military again, because the House and Senate of Congress have already passed a military expenditure bill of $2 billion. According to a naval officer, the biggest difficulty at present is the lack of skilled technical workers to manufacture new weapons, but the naval expansion plan is being accelerated. He also said that it is inconvenient to verify the rumors that the Navy is about to develop a harbor in Guam (the island is about 1,500 miles from Yokohama, Japan), and it is also inconvenient to discuss the news of developing other naval ports in the Pacific. It is reported that the US Navy will ask Congress to allocate huge sums of money to establish aviation experiment stations and increase "educational" industrial orders. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>

The remarks of the Japanese authorities in North China are recorded as follows: Since the incident of Lieutenant Colonel Spears' violation of military law occurred, the parties concerned have actively started the trial. As a result, Mr. Spears seemed to have acted as a spy to benefit the enemy. After several careful investigations, the documents and evidence involved the act of violating military law.

However, an official from the Foreign Ministry informed representatives of the warring nations on Tuesday that Japan would not interfere in the European war and asked them to pay attention to eliminating various possible causes to avoid unexpected incidents involving the warring nations in China. The warring nations have not yet responded to this friendly recommendation, nor is there any indication that they will withdraw their troops from China. A reporter asked if Japan would object if neutral country troops were to supplement their lack. The spokesperson replied that if such a development occurred, Japan would explain its attitude on the matter. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Today's Sao Dang Pao published an editorial strongly criticizing Japan's demand that Britain and France withdraw their troops from China and expressing confidence that Britain and France would reject this unreasonable demand. The newspaper stated that Japan's motives for making this request were twofold: (1) to take advantage of the current European war to eliminate British and French interests and influence in China, and (2) to create a precedent for handling China's diplomatic affairs on behalf of China. The newspaper concluded by stating that whether Britain and France should withdraw their troops stationed in China in principle is another matter, but we do not want them to withdraw their troops to facilitate Japan's aggression against China.

<p>Tianjin – According to news from here today, Japanese sentries again caused trouble for British citizens at the barricades. British citizens at the entrances and exits of the British concession often have to wait for several hours for Japanese sentries to inspect their passes. Sometimes, after the passes are presented, the Japanese soldiers still do not allow them to pass. Furthermore, the Japanese consul protested to the British consul here yesterday about the incident on Wednesday in which four British soldiers assaulted Japanese nationals Inoue and his wife, and claimed that the four British soldiers had taken a Japanese sampan without permission, crossed the barricades, and fled into the British concession. It is reported that the British consul has agreed to investigate the matter. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Foreign merchants here, due to Japan's demand that British naval and land forces withdraw from China, are preparing to rely on Manila instead of Hong Kong for future business. China is preparing to increase the number of express air services and postal services to Hanoi and Yangon when Hong Kong is isolated. The Telecommunications Bureau has also increased the number of telegraph offices to maintain close contact with Manila. Although the Eurasia Aviation Corporation has cancelled its Hong Kong flights due to German investment, the Xi'an flights have now resumed. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Tianjin – Yesterday, the Japanese authorities protested to the British side that on Wednesday evening, a Japanese couple, Mr. and Mrs. Inoue, were sailing in a sampan within the boundaries of Special District One when four drunken British soldiers forcibly boarded the sampan and insulted them. Mr. and Mrs. Inoue left the boat and went elsewhere, and the sampan was driven by the British soldiers to the British concession. After receiving this protest, the British authorities are currently investigating the matter. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e30">Governor General of Canada Declares State of War with Germany; Prepares to Actively Assist Britain with Material Resources; Takes Various Measures to Defend Coastline <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Ottawa – When Governor General of Canada, Lord Tweedsmuir, addressed the emergency session of Parliament yesterday, he announced that a state of war now exists between Canada and Germany. His speech did not include a formal declaration of war against Germany. Lord Tweedsmuir declared that the Canadian militia, air force, and navy had already been placed on active duty, and the government had taken other measures to defend the Canadian coast. "Other recommendations for taking active action will be presented to you." It is widely believed that Canada will not formally declare war on Germany, hoping to use this as a "back door" for Britain, so that US military materials can be continuously imported into Britain. It is generally recalled that when President Roosevelt invoked the Neutrality Act this week to prohibit the export of munitions, he did not include Canada among the belligerent nations. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Ottawa – The Canadian Federal Senate and House of Commons convened a joint session at 3:00 PM to discuss various necessary defense measures and the issue of Canada's cooperation with Britain in resisting aggression. Governor General of Canada, Lord Tweedsmuir, then read out the Royal Decree, which stated: "As members of Parliament are aware, our efforts to maintain peace in Europe have all failed. The United Kingdom has entered into war with Germany in order to uphold the obligations it accepted to prevent war. The purpose of this decision by the Federal Government to convene a temporary meeting of members of Parliament is to request that Parliament authorize the government to take all necessary measures to defend Canada and to cooperate with Britain in the struggle against aggression, so as to establish the principle internationally that disputes should be resolved peacefully rather than by force in the future. To date, reservists for the army, navy, and air force have been called up, and the Federal Government has taken various measures in accordance with existing laws to defend the coastline and ensure domestic security. We further request that members of Parliament discuss the temporary budget so that the Federal Government can adequately meet the various expenses necessary for the current war or those that may be necessary in the future. The current situation is extremely serious, and the spirit demonstrated by the people of Canada in responding to events is no different from that of other subjects of the United Kingdom and the people of the various Dominions. The British government believes that Canada will support our efforts to defend the principles of freedom that we all share." It is not yet officially known what measures the Canadian Federal Government intends to take to assist Britain. According to informed sources, the total amount of the temporary budget to be passed by Parliament will be between 50 million and 100 million Canadian dollars (this year's regular budget totals 63 million Canadian dollars). The duration of this temporary session will not be too long, and it is expected to close after a few days of meetings. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Ottawa – The speech delivered by the Governor General of Canada at the joint session of the Senate and House of Commons has been commented on by political figures, who stated that the phrase "expenses necessary for the current war or those that may be necessary in the future" almost implies that a state of war has been established between the Canadian Federation and Germany. However, the right to declare a state of war rests with Parliament, and Prime Minister Mackenzie King may not formally request it from Parliament. On the contrary, due to various political reasons, he would rather maintain an ambiguous situation. In short, Canada's assistance to Britain is not in question, but formally declaring war on Germany, which would cause the current US Neutrality Act to be applied to this country, would be inconvenient. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Ottawa – The Canadian Federal Government is currently planning to establish a national monopoly system for wheat throughout the country during the European war. This is one way to stabilize wheat prices, but it is reported that it will not be implemented immediately. It is generally said that wheat prices have recently risen sharply, and as the government is requesting Parliament to pass a temporary budget and urgently needs to open up sources of revenue, the burden on the national treasury can be greatly reduced.

<p>Tokyo – The Japan Times commented on the progress of the European war, stating that the strategies of Britain and France are the opposite of Germany's. Britain and France clearly want to prolong the war. If the two countries are fighting with the firm determination to defeat Nazism, then the war may be more serious than initially expected, and the war will become increasingly tragic. No one denies that Germany is strong, but its economic power is insufficient, and the United States may participate in the war. Therefore, Germany may use its entire air force, which is rich in destructive power, to try to bomb London and Paris in a timely manner. At this time, it seems too early to talk about the non-expansion of the war and the political solution of this issue. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e35">Japanese Plan Two-Pronged Offensive in Hubei Province; Main Force Distributed North of the Yangtze River; Battle Has Begun on Yuezhou Front <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing – According to observations by military experts here, Japan seems to be planning a final offensive in Hubei Province in September or October, attempting to end the war as soon as possible. The offensive routes can be divided into two: First, along the Han River through Fancheng to Laohekou, then westward to spy on Hanzhong, and after reaching Hanzhong, advance north to reach Xi'an, while simultaneously threatening the highway traffic to Chengdu. The second offensive route is to cross the Han River to spy on Yichang, control navigation on the Yangtze River, and simultaneously subject Chongqing to incessant air raids by Japanese aircraft. Another offensive route is to land from the Beihai area to cut off China's land transportation in the southwest. However, the current Japanese army in China is not strong enough to speak of a final offensive. If it wants to implement the final offensive plan, the Japanese side will have to increase its troop strength by 500,000 from Japan to maintain the rear transportation lines. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Reports received here of the Japanese army concentrating naval and land forces in Central and South China are quite encouraging. It is reported that a large number of fresh troops transferred from various places, as well as 18 gunboats and warships, have arrived in Hankou. The main force of the Japanese army is distributed north of the Yangtze River, with only a small number of troops dispatched to the Yuezhou area. Japanese cavalry patrols the area along the Han River in central Hubei, apparently as a preparatory step for a general offensive. Fighting has already begun on the Yuezhou front. It is reported that several thousand Japanese soldiers have begun to attack Chinese guerrilla forces. In South China, 23 Japanese warships, including one aircraft carrier, have been concentrated near the Leizhou Peninsula, and multiple Japanese warships have also been discovered near Xiangzhou Island south of Beihai. It is reported that the Japanese commander has arrived on Xiangzhou Island and that there will be military action in the near future. Informed sources here expect Japan to take advantage of the international situation to intensify its military operations against China. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to reliable sources, the Japanese side is currently preparing 50 gunboats for attacking Shashi and Yichang. It is reported that half of these 50 ships were transferred from North China, and the other half were transferred from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. They are now concentrated between Hankou, Jiujiang, and Nanjing. Part of them arrived in Yuezhou at the end of August, preparing to attack. It is reported that in addition to the naval attack on Shashi and Yichang, the army is also simultaneously attacking on land. It is reported that the Japanese army in western Hubei has now increased by one division, or 25,000 men, equipped with various mechanized units. It is reported that the Japanese side is also planning to transfer troops from Japan to China for reinforcement. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to the Ta Kung Pao here, fighting has recently become fierce from Sanshui in the south to Baotou in the north. The westward attack by the Japanese army in Lishi, Shanxi, is clearly intended to cross the river and attack Yan'an, the base of the Communist Party. It is reported that the current Japanese army attacking western Shanxi has a force of 2,000 men and is assisted by aircraft, but is currently being blocked by the Chinese army's river defense forces. At the same time, the number of Japanese warships in the South China Sea has also increased compared to before. The number of Japanese soldiers in Sanshui, Guangdong, has also increased by 5,000 this week. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>

<p>London: British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, along with the entire staff of the embassy, returned home from Rotterdam, Netherlands, aboard the "Batavier" ship. It arrived at Grafschaft, England, at 5:15 p.m. today. As the ship passed through the English Channel, it was escorted by five destroyers. It is reported that the warships encountered a submarine en route and dropped depth charges.</p>
<p>Note: The Ambassador and his party were detained on the German side of the German-Dutch border on September 5 for several hours, awaiting news that members of the German Embassy in England had arrived in Dutch territorial waters. This was because the German authorities wanted to be certain that the German embassy staff had been released before allowing the British ambassador to leave Germany. Subsequently, the Dutch government mediated and exchanged the staff of both embassies. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e48">Evolution of the European Situation Does Not Harm China's War of Resistance - China is a Self-Sufficient Country, Impact is Smaller - New Inland Industries Gain Development Opportunities <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The impact of the European war on China's war of resistance is a matter of great international concern, and especially cherished by patriotic Chinese. According to an observer: (1) China is a vast country with abundant resources. Two or three hundred years ago, it was a closed-off country. Its people are hardworking and simple, and their material lives are extremely simple. This state is still maintained in remote areas of the interior.</p>
<p>According to historical examples, the influence of the external environment on agricultural countries is necessarily lighter than that on industrial countries, because they are accustomed to a simple life. (2) China is currently engaged in a war of resistance, and the supply of armaments and military supplies is the first priority. This was foreseen by the wise Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>After two years of effort in the war of resistance, in addition to heavy weapons, ordinary armaments have already been able to reach the point of self-sufficiency. Many of the larger pharmaceutical factories operated by Chinese in the coastal ports have also moved inland, which will be of great help to rescue work. (3) Exports of domestic products may be somewhat affected by the European war, but on the other hand, the</p>
<p>reduced import of foreign goods is sufficient to offset part of it. China's new industries have made considerable achievements in the interior over the past two years, and will certainly have more opportunities for full development in the future. Therefore, no matter how the European war situation evolves, it will not hinder China's war of resistance. Moreover, China's current international routes, such as those to the Soviet Union and the United States, have not undergone any fundamental changes.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Floods Inundate Land, Boats Sail Inland - Tianjin and Daghu Become a Marsh <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Residents of Japanese Concessions Suffer Even More</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reports that a foreigner from Tianjin, who is now in Shanghai, described the shocking situation of the great flood in Tianjin to a reporter yesterday, saying that he had experienced the earthquake in Messina, Italy, but the Tianjin flood was even more tragic. The situation there is almost "hopeless". On the morning of August 20, the flood quickly flowed eastward into Tianjin. By the afternoon of that day, the people of Tianjin</p>
<p>were cut off by the water, which reached depths of fifteen feet in several places. As the flood flowed eastward, it gradually increased, streets were flooded, and residents were trapped in their homes. The situation in the Japanese Concession was appalling, and the residents there suffered even more than the other people of Tianjin. Diseases immediately followed. The authorities are carrying out sanitation work throughout the area. The British Army, the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, stationed in Tianjin, has moved its barracks into the Jardine Matheson warehouse due to the flood. The military hospital has also been moved into the Astor Hotel. The water and electricity, which had been cut off by the flood, were restored on Tuesday, and the British Concession was re-illuminated at night. However, there is a risk of electrocution when standing in the accumulated water near the power connections. Many people have died as a result. One of the most serious consequences of the flood is that the dead cannot be buried, but can only be</p>
<p>the corpses are abandoned in the river. There is also a danger to health, namely that cesspools have broken open and the city's sewage pipes are becoming increasingly dangerous. The situation in Tianjin will be even worse when the water recedes. The number of deaths caused by the flood cannot be estimated at present, but on the first day of the flood, there were more than a thousand deaths. Sampans, small boats, or rafts made of soap boxes are used to navigate the streets. Foreigners can get about one pint of water in the morning and evening for washing. Because the accumulated water is dirty, various skin diseases are prevalent after wading. Between Tianjin and Daghu,</p>
<p>has become a marsh. Although food is not currently in short supply, it may run out in the future. Rice is still being distributed on a rationing system. 95% of Tianjin's businesses have been shut down. Dysentery and cholera are expected to occur after the water recedes. Many foreign women and children, including military dependents, have retreated to Qinhuangdao, but there are still a small number of foreign women living in the British Concession. The railway between Tianjin and Daghu has been cut off. The Daghu sandbar has also been blocked, preventing navigation, which is another consequence of the flood. The British Concession's labor bureau, especially the police, and volunteer helpers are carrying out rescue work, which is very admirable.</p>

<p>Silk Cocoon Merchants Wait and See</p>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: In this autumn sericulture season, the villagers sold the spring cocoons for high prices, and also heard that silk sales were smooth and silk prices were rising, so all of them over-bred silk worms. The supply of autumn mulberry leaves could not meet the demand. Currently, the silk worms in Xin'an, Kaihua, Nanyan, Qingcheng and other townships are in good condition, and the majority have already entered the cocooning stage, but the supply of mulberry leaves is insufficient, and the price of leaves is about ten yuan. Small silk factories in rural areas, because the number of spring cocoons collected was not large, pre-ordered autumn cocoons at 150 to 200 yuan per load, and paid almost all of the deposit. After the silkworms entered the cocooning stage, they were sold to small silk factories, and the deposit was deducted. Because silkworm farmers did not have money to buy more mulberry leaves, they were happy to accept this. However, since the outbreak of the European war, silk prices have plummeted, and silk cocoon merchants have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Small silk factories that paid the deposit are also feeling worried.</p>

<p>Cheng Has Been Dismissed by the Japanese</p>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: In the past half month, banditry has been rampant inside and outside Wuxi city. Four plainclothes bandits, armed with short guns, went to the Chongsou Temple Dongji Tongyin Bank in the bustling city center the day before yesterday. After entering, they forbade anyone from making a sound, and robbed 16,400 yuan in cash before fleeing in different directions. It is reported that these bandits were soldiers of the puppet army Cheng Wannian stationed in Wuxi. Recently, the robbery cases in Wuxi have all been committed by Cheng's troops. As for Cheng Wannian himself, he has been dismissed by the Japanese army, and Su Yaoxin has been appointed as the acting puppet pacification commander. It can be seen that those who act as accomplices will not end well.</p>

<p>The Puppet Side has Exhausted its Resources</p>
<p>Nanjing Correspondence: The counties in the occupied areas, under the wing of the Japanese, have organized puppet county offices. Although they have tried their best to search and seize, the expenses are huge, and the income cannot cover the expenses. The local budget for the second half of the 28th year of the puppet provincial government in the counties of Jiangnan is 3 million yuan less than the first half, so that the subsidies allocated to the puppet offices have not been available.</p>
<p>Hao Peng, the head of the puppet finance department, proposed at the puppet finance ministry meeting a few days ago to distribute 1,235 points of counterfeit copper auxiliary coins in Suzhou and circulate them in the counties. It will be issued six weeks later. Regarding the subsidy funds, the puppet finance ministry only allowed it to be distributed by the special agent class in the same amount as before. Moreover, because the puppet side forced the use of Huaxing counterfeit banknotes, the people in various places generally believed in legal tender, and the use of counterfeit banknotes was greatly hindered. At present, paying the puppet tax still uses both legal tender and counterfeit banknotes. Under the above circumstances, the economic situation of the puppet agencies has been stretched.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Two Years of Eliminating Illiteracy for 20 Million People Nationwide <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Implementing Remedial Education for Out-of-School People - Provinces in the Rear Start Civil Schools Ahead of Schedule</p>
<p>(Chongqing News) There are approximately 220 million young men and women out of school beyond compulsory education in China, accounting for half of the country's population. Most of these people are over 16 years old, and they are in their prime and are the backbone of social labor and production. In order to remedy this, the Ministry of Education formulated and implemented measures for supplementary education for out-of-school people in the autumn of the 25th year, and ordered all provinces and cities to complete the plan within six years and eliminate illiteracy. The method of promotion is that each county and city should add 20 to 40 civil schools each year. Each school should run at least two sessions each year, and each session should run two classes, with 50 people in each class. Each session lasts about three to six months. First implement the plan for men and women aged 16 to 30, and continue to promote it to people who are older or younger. People may also be forced to attend school. This work has been going on for two years and has been quite effective. Although this war has been slightly affected, it has not been fully implemented according to the original plan, but the difference is not very far. According to the regulations of the six-year plan for supplementary education for out-of-school people, 12 million people should be eliminated from illiteracy in the 25th year, and 20 million people should be eliminated from illiteracy in the 26th year. However, according to the reports submitted by various provinces and cities, the number of people eliminated from illiteracy in the 25th year has reached more than 16 million, exceeding the original plan by more than 4 million. Among them, a part still needs to be verified. However, based on the original planned number, it must be more than that, not less. Although the war in the 26th year has affected the war zone provinces to a considerable extent, out-of-school people are mostly the most powerful members directly or indirectly in the war of resistance, and the need for this supplementary education is even more urgent. Therefore, in the provinces behind the battlefield, most of them are implementing it more and starting it earlier. Checking the total number, it can still reach the scheduled number. The numbers listed in the war zone provinces may have a difference, but taking half of them into account, it should be more than 10 million. Therefore, the total number of people eliminated from illiteracy in the past two years is at least 20 million or more.</p>

<p>(Qujiang Correspondence) The Guangdong Provincial Education Department, in view of the fact that public and private secondary schools need to be jointly established due to various relationships such as environment, funding, and personnel, should formulate measures to have a basis for them. The outline of the Guangdong Provincial Joint Middle School Measures has now been formulated and approved by the Provincial Government and promulgated. The main points are as follows: (1) Secondary schools, regardless of senior, junior, male, female, middle schools, normal schools, or vocational schools, can be jointly established, but the limit is two to three schools. (2) Public schools shall not be combined with private schools, and registered schools shall not be combined with unregistered schools. (3) Joint middle schools belonging to the public shall be prefixed with the place name of the original affiliation, and joint middle schools belonging to private schools shall be prefixed with a special name. (4) The expenses of public joint middle schools shall be borne by the original school's directly affiliated agency, and the expenses of private joint middle schools shall be borne separately by the original school's board of directors through consultation. (5) The principal of the public joint middle school shall be designated by the competent educational administrative agency, and the principal of the private joint school shall be jointly promoted by the original school's board of directors. (6) Joint middle schools shall give priority to hiring the faculty and staff of the original schools. (7) Joint middle schools should give priority to admitting students from the original schools. It is reported that according to the above measures, the established ones include Zhongshan County Joint Middle School and Nanhai County Joint Middle School, and the ones under preparation include the Provincial Qiongyai Joint Middle School.</p>

<p>The Internal Organization is Divided into Eight Departments - 143 Graduates</p>
<p>Since Lai Lian took over as the president of the National Northwest Institute of Technology, he has actively reorganized the interior and raised curriculum standards. All faculty, staff, students, instruments and machines have been completely concentrated in one place within the past six months. The first graduates of this year include 65 in civil engineering, 12 in mechanical engineering, 21 in mining and metallurgy, 20 in electrical engineering, 6 in chemical engineering, 12 in aeronautical engineering, and 7 in textile engineering, totaling 143 people. They have all been hired by various military and political agencies, highways, railway factories. The four departments of mechanical engineering, mining and metallurgy, aeronautical engineering and textile engineering have four or five positions available for each person to choose from, and the supply cannot meet the demand. More than 150 students from the third grade of each department of the college were also sent to factories in various places for internships during this summer vacation. By the time school starts in November, there will be more than a thousand new and old students. The college has the mission of cultivating engineering talents and developing the Northwest. It is divided in eight departments: civil, mechanical, aeronautical, electrical, mining, chemical, water conservancy, and textile engineering. It has gathered talents and equipment from the four major engineering colleges and has become the largest engineering school with the most departments in the country.</p>

<p>(Guiping Correspondence) The first phase of adult education in Guiping County has been held in 23 townships, 592 classes, with 26,467 students and 310 teachers. 23,991 people who passed the exams this summer vacation graduated, and the adult classes in Shizui Township Dajie Houchi Street, Nanjin Township Dongta Village, Chengxi Town Ximen Street, Yonghe Township Peixin Village, and Xiawan Township Xiawan Market are the best. An old woman surnamed Ma from the North Street of Jiangkou Town, who is over 50 years old, knew the suffering of unemployment well. When it started, she took the initiative to ask the supervisor to allow her to enroll in the class. By the time she graduated, her scores in all subjects were above 80. It can be seen from this that the adult education in the county has achieved good results.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department reported on the medical affairs of the schools set up by the Bureau last month, stating that all the schools set up by the Bureau were on summer vacation this month, so the main work of the medical affairs of the schools set up by the Bureau was only to inject preventive cold shots and to carry out the movement to treat trachoma in various Chinese children's primary schools. A total of 1,295 students who were willing to inject preventive cold shots had their names registered, but only 61 received the first injection, only 491 received the second injection, and only 347 received the third injection. The result is very disappointing. It is truly unsatisfactory that parents and students are so easily negligent in such an important method of disease prevention. The majority of residents still lack hygiene knowledge. During this summer vacation, a total of 445 students went to various trachoma treatment centers for medical treatment due to bad weather, with a total of 1,790 visits. In addition, there were two teachers, graduates, and school servants who volunteered to go for treatment on time. Various schools have set up summer tutoring classes, so the work of the school inspection team was very busy this month. Most of the boarding students of the schools still stayed in the schools during the summer vacation. A total of 181 inspections were made to various subsidized Chinese private schools this month.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Finance: Foreign Exchange Stable with a Slight Tendency to Loosen <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in HSBC's listed rates. Due to the lack of significant news to influence the market, most operators in the unofficial British and American exchange markets adopted a wait-and-see approach. As a result, the sudden situation turned calm, and the trend also became stable. The morning opening was slightly weaker, but later, Hong Kong's increased selling pressure, coupled with some sales from small traders, caused the market to drop to as low as 3 pence and 9375 for British gold and 6.625 yuan for the US dollar. However, Sassoon, a Western firm, suddenly intervened with purchases, and the Bank of England also absorbed some on behalf of another party, so the market rebounded to 3 pence and 8125 for British gold and 6.4375 yuan for the US dollar. In the afternoon, Hong Kong again increased selling pressure, and Sassoon also re-emerged with sales, so British gold ultimately ended weaker by 0.03125 and the US dollar also slightly stronger by 0.0625. The current month's futures prices were comparable to spot prices, and the overall volume of transactions was not as high as in the previous days.</p>
<p>Selling Pressure from Hong Kong</p>
<p>The morning began with London's large bars at 25 for the near-term and 3125 up for the long-term. New York silver prices rose by half a point. London's raw gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate for British against American remained unchanged, against Shanghai down by a small half a penny, against France up by a large 100 francs. Exchange rates for American against other currencies were not received. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling prices in the morning were 3 pence and 8125 for British gold and 6.4375 yuan for the US dollar, which were slightly tighter by 0.03125 for British gold and slightly softer by 0.0625 for the US dollar compared to the previous closing. After the opening, the situation was stable, with no significant changes. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, there were no changes. And the silver parity tax was revealed, up by a large 1.25. After that, Hong Kong suddenly increased selling pressure, selling spot British gold at 3 pence 875 and 906115, and spot US dollars at 6.5625 and 625 to foreign banks such as HSBC and a certain American bank. Subsequently, some Shanghai merchants also slightly sold spot British gold at 3 pence 90625 and 9375 to HSBC. As a result, the process was somewhat firmer. Afterwards, Sassoon, a Western firm, suddenly intervened with purchases, and the Bank of England also absorbed some, causing the market to immediately stabilize. Sassoon favorably absorbed spot British gold at 3 pence 875 and 8125, and spot US dollars at 6.5625 and 4375 from foreign banks such as HSBC. Until the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 3 pence 84375 for British gold and 6.5 yuan for the US dollar.</p>
<p>Sassoon Re-emerges After Entering the Market</p>
<p>The market situation was extremely stable in the early afternoon. However, after 2:30 PM, due to renewed selling pressure from Hong Kong, Sassoon also re-emerged with sales, causing the situation to be stable with a slight tendency to firm.

<h3 id="e70">Hong Kong Speculators Emerge, Gold Prices Slightly Decline - Bidding Opens at 3,800 Yuan <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market was weak and unstable. Trading activity was small and the trend was generally flat. Overall it fluctuated throughout the day. Ultimately, due to the weakening of foreign exchange and the re-emergence of Hong Kong speculators, prices fell by 105 yuan. Initially, strong buying interest from a certain money exchange dealer, combined with slightly weaker foreign exchange rates, caused the morning opening to surge to a peak of 4,050 yuan. Subsequently, the sudden weakening of foreign exchange rates triggered a wave of selling. Silver shops and a certain bank competed to sell, causing prices to plummet to 3,820 yuan. Later, with the rebound of foreign exchange rates, securities firms and gold dealers took the opportunity to aggressively bid, briefly reaching 3,950 yuan again. Afterwards, money exchange dealers, acting on behalf of Hong Kong speculators, increased selling pressure, causing the afternoon closing price to fall to 3,870 yuan. In the afternoon, money exchange dealers continued to sell for Hong Kong speculators, and due to a lack of buyers, the opening price was lowered to 3,800 yuan. Soon, securities firms suddenly increased buying interest, pushing prices up to 3,900 yuan. Ultimately, due to strong foreign exchange rates, prices retreated to 3,855 yuan at the closing. However, daily trading volume remained high, at over 1,700 taels. Ornamental gold was priced 10 yuan lower. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Plunges by Over 100 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning opening, each bar (10 taels) saw a high opening of 90 yuan due to strong buying interest from a certain money exchange dealer and slightly weaker foreign exchange rates, with few sellers. A certain money exchange dealer bought from a gold shop at 4,050 yuan. Subsequently, the sudden weakening of foreign exchange rates triggered a wave of selling. Silver shops frequently offered to sell, and retail investors sold more than they bought, causing prices to plummet by 150 yuan. A certain stockbroker sold 30 taels for 3,900 yuan. Later, a certain broker absorbed 50 taels on behalf of clients, briefly pulling prices up to 3,950 yuan. However, due to the rush of sellers, certain banks aggressively sold on behalf of clients, causing prices to fall sharply again, plunging by 130 yuan. Silver shops sold 30 taels to a money exchange dealer at 3,820 yuan. Afterwards, a certain silver shop suddenly increased buying interest and urgently reversed its position. A certain silver shop bought 30 taels from a gold shop, and another 10 taels from a peer, at 3,900 yuan. Later, due to the aggressive sale of over 100 taels by a cash shop, prices fell back to 3,850 yuan. At that time, foreign exchange rates suddenly strengthened, and securities firms and gold dealers scrambled to absorb the supply. Although money exchange dealers sold more than they bought, continuous buying from a certain silver shop caused prices to soar by 100 yuan. A securities firm bought 20 taels from a money exchange dealer for 3,950 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange dealer became increasingly eager to sell, and a certain gold dealer also followed suit, causing prices to weaken again, eventually falling by 110 yuan. Gold dealers traded 10 taels among themselves for 3,840 yuan. At noon, prices rebounded slightly, with a money exchange dealer buying 20 taels from a silver shop for 3,870 yuan, setting the noon closing price. The afternoon opening saw a steep decline of 70 yuan due to strong selling interest from a certain money exchange dealer and a lack of forward-looking purchases. A certain gold dealer bought 20 taels from a money exchange dealer for 3,800 yuan. Later, the buying power of a certain gold dealer and securities firms was still strong. Although a certain money exchange dealer continued to sell, demand still exceeded supply, causing prices to soar by 100 yuan. A securities firm bought 30 taels from a silver shop for 3,900 yuan. Afterwards, hearing that foreign exchange rates were weakening, buying interest subsided, and money exchange dealers and silver shops scrambled to sell, causing prices to fall by 45 yuan. A money exchange dealer sold 30 taels to a certain bank for 3,855 yuan, setting the evening closing price. Compared to the previous day, spot gold fell by 105 yuan. It was reported that after the closing, a money exchange dealer sold three portions to a gold shop for 3,850 yuan. The daily fluctuation was 250 yuan. The selling price of cash shops was 10 yuan higher than spot gold, while the actual price of gold was 55 yuan lower than the listed price. Transactions were rare.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Cotton Yarn: New Changyin Cotton Arrives on the Market - Opening Price at 127 Yuan <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The trading of spot cotton between Chinese and foreign merchants is bustling and the trend is unusually lively. This situation is entirely due to the outbreak of the World War, with various countries collecting and storing cotton as a military necessity. Consequently, the three major cotton markets in Europe and America have soared in unison. Telegrams from American cotton markets suddenly jumped by 70-80 points, and spot middling has risen to 10 cents. This has startled the market and boosted the buying intentions of businesses, leading to increased transactions in the market. The merchant group purchased 1,000 bales of white low middling cotton, with prices starting at 141.5 yuan and reaching 150 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous day. At the same time, Chinese factories, recognizing this trend, have also changed their approach and actively sourced materials. Yesterday, Shui'an, Rongfeng, and other British and Unity, Chongxin factories purchased a total of 800 bales of Indian cotton. 200 bales of 10-count coarse yarn raw material Pingguo'er were transacted, with prices up by 6.75 yuan compared to the previous day. Brazilian cotton rose by 8 yuan, and new Tonghua cotton rose by 8-9 yuan. However, Japanese factories have not yet taken action. Under these market conditions, factory activity should lead to continued price increases in the market. The supply from Northern Jiangsu is abundant, with 621 bales of Tongzhou cotton arriving at the docks. The current spot cotton situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Special News: Since its arrival on the market, the selling price of new Tonghua cotton has been steadily increasing. New Changyin sand cotton also opened at 127.5 yuan. According to industry sources, Yiyang, Zhejiang, had favorable weather conditions from the time of sowing, with suitable temperature and humidity, resulting in healthy growth and early sales. Prices there are 55-60 yuan per sima catty. Shanghai is not expected to receive shipments in the near future.</p>
<p>Additional News: In Shanghai, overseas cotton transactions have seen soaring prices in overseas cotton markets in recent days. The exchange rate in this city is also tight, making the converted cotton prices particularly high. Furthermore, since the Customs Revenue Department's tariff adjustment, customs duties are now subject to manipulation. At present, each bale of raw cotton requires an import tax of 10.71 yuan, an increase of over 5 yuan compared to the past. Therefore, overseas cotton transactions have been particularly active. All parties are purchasing as much as possible, but there is a shortage of goods to meet demand. Brazilian cotton of 32 count has reached a high price of 190 yuan, and raw cotton of 42 count is priced at over 230 yuan. However, the Song'an bank still quotes 3 yuan lower. Moreover, the shipment of cotton to Shanghai is difficult and the risk of war has greatly increased. Therefore, all parties are willing to purchase spot goods. This is the reason.</p>
<p>Overseas Cotton Market Prices: In the New York cotton market, the initial market yesterday was particularly firm due to speculative purchases. Later, due to the soaring prices of stock cotton, sentiment was particularly strong. The market suddenly jumped by 50 points at the close due to enthusiastic buyers. The Indian cotton market was relatively quiet and is expected to rise by 2-3 rupees. Egyptian cotton fell by 50 points. In the Liverpool cotton market, the government ordered restrictions on trading, so the cotton market was particularly calm.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Sudden Increase in Demand for Single Yarn <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is increasingly stable. Although actual demand is weak, continuous purchases from Hong Kong merchants mean the demand for 20-count Five Blessings and Shepherd brands is comparatively higher, and selling prices have risen. As for 20-count Inu-Onna and Double Globe brands, due to their lower prices compared to Double Horse, businesses generally use them as tools, buying and selling at will, causing market prices to fluctuate. Transactions of 10-count coarse yarn have been largely stagnant. Due to the off-season, inquiries are rare, and the market is sluggish. Cloth factories have slightly increased demand for 32-count single yarn, and the market has become more active. Coupled with expensive raw materials, there has been a recent significant upturn. Yesterday, the Xie Ma warehouse order price was uniquely discounted because the 3,000 bales issued the day before were required to be paid in full by tomorrow. If the warehouse order is not cashed, the contract will be canceled. However, factories that had close contact can have them transferred.</p>
<p>At the current yarn market opening, the weakness from the previous day's afternoon market continued. 40 bales of 20-count Double Globe were transacted at 620-623 yuan, similar to the previous day's price. Shortly after, news of a weaker foreign exchange opening boosted buying interest and market prices gradually increased. Double Globe rose to 642 yuan, the Double Horse warehouse order price was 635-642 yuan, and the spot price was 690-692 yuan. There was a slight setback midway, but ultimately the warehouse order price for Xie was slightly lower. It is estimated that 1,625 bales were transacted in half a day. Market conditions showed an increase of 6 yuan for Double, 10 yuan for Shepherd, and 10 yuan for Double Globe. The amount purchased by each merchant is listed below:</p>
<p>Afternoon News: Sentiment in the cotton yarn market is good. Due to soaring raw cotton prices, buyers are quite active. It is said that the closing market price will increase, but no one is willing to sell and waiting to see what will happen tomorrow.</p>

Fine twill sales were stable. The merchants on this street all unanimously believe in an increase, the therefore the number of purchases exceeded the number of sales. However, a total of around four to five hundred pieces of fine cloth and fine twill are traded daily.</p>

<p>Du Early Rice: There were still no shipments arriving from He Xia yesterday. And only over two thousand bales of Che Lun Bao Zi arrived. As a result, the early market saw a renewed sense of optimism, and prices for all goods were raised by 2-3 yuan. Later, due to insufficient actual demand, the situation weakened, and the market quickly retreated. As a result, the best new early rice saw initial gains followed by declines, while the price of thick early rice remained high due to a lack of inventory. It is estimated that excellent tin early rice sold for 40-38.9 yuan, medium grade 37 yuan, Wu Kun white early rice 38 yuan, medium/secondary 37 yuan, He Xia early/late rice 33.45 yuan, original bale 37-36.5 yuan, old Du glutinous sharp rice dropped from 30 yuan to 28 yuan, new sharp rice dropped from 30 yuan to 27-28 yuan, Jiangbei new sharp rice opened at 30 yuan, then closed at only 28-27.5 yuan, Jiaxing and Jiashan new Chuan sharp rice 27 yuan, Yang Tuan sharp rice 27-28 yuan, Bian Yuan 30 yuan.

Sentiment weakened, and buying interest fell off. The seller, unable to sell at high prices, quickly sold to recover as much as they could. Market prices quickly fell by as much as 2-3 yuan, and were lower than the previous day's market prices by over 1 yuan. The price of Jiangbei new early rice, which initially opened at 29.5 yuan, fell back to 27-28 yuan, while medium grade was only 25-26 yuan.</p>

<p>Flour: Yesterday, the factory price increased by another cent, now being sold for 6.7 yuan in cash.

Selling prices have increased to 6.85-6.9 yuan. Yesterday, active purchases continued from this street. Fragmentary purchases were also made by northern merchants.

<p>On the second day after the Japanese government formally declared war on the cowardly British regarding Guangzhou (the 5th), it used the excuse of advising the warring nations of England, France, Germany, and Poland to avoid unfortunate incidents in China, and demanded that England and France withdraw their troops from Japanese-occupied areas. Currently, the Japanese side is conducting parallel diplomatic actions from both Tokyo and Shanghai. We have no way of speculating on the attitudes of London and Paris. However, according to the opinions of British officials, Germany and Poland have no troops stationed in China, which is not enough to constitute a factor that would cause unfortunate incidents, and all believe that there is no need to withdraw troops. Rumors about troop withdrawal in Shanghai are rampant, mostly based on hearsay and speculation, and none have been verified. Currently, foreign nationals have resumed normal life and are carrying out their respective duties. Here is a compilation of news obtained yesterday, detailed below:</p>
<h3 id="e84">Britain Has Not Considered Withdrawing Far East Troops <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>

<p>British Embassy Denies Withdrawal of Troops</p>
<p>Confirmed news: the British Embassy officially denied yesterday that it had received instructions from the British government to order the withdrawal of British army and navy from Japanese-occupied areas. The embassy spokesperson stated that the Japanese side's suggestion to withdraw British troops had been forwarded to the British government, but London has not yet issued instructions. To the best of his knowledge, the "Japan Times", a Japanese Foreign Ministry mouthpiece newspaper published in Beijing, stated that the British army and navy were about to leave Shanghai, which is absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>Reportedly Has Not Considered This</p>
<p>A reporter from the Dà Zhōng News Agency visited an important official at the British Consulate yesterday at 3 p.m. to inquire about the British side's view of the Japanese diplomatic move. He said that the consul had visited the English and Italian consuls on the 6th, and the Polish consul had also been met. Sān Pǔ's request was clear, but since Germany and Poland have no troops stationed in Shanghai, how can conflict occur? As of now, I have not heard that Britain has considered withdrawing troops. Britain is determined to maintain the position of the concessions as in the past, knowing full well that once the British troops leave, other countries' troops will soon follow.</p>
<p>Japanese Newspaper Promotion Has Another Purpose</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo English "Japan Times" the day before yesterday (the 7th) there was the following comment: "Japan has now declared neutrality, according to international law, Japan has the right to demand that the warring countries withdraw their troops from the occupied areas. Japan has not yet formally made the request, but British troops and warships have withdrawn from Chinese territory, such as warships sailing to Singapore, troops sailing to Hong Kong, leaving only a few British and French gunboats in the Yangtze River that cannot sail in the ocean." Now that the content of this comment has been denied by the British ambassador and the British Consulate, it can be seen that it is another Japanese propaganda effort.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Shanghai Foreign Community Gradually Returning to Normal <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the people of the warring and neutral countries residing in Shanghai are focusing all their attention on the latest European telegrams and wireless news. However, not much has been seen so far of the developments arising from the European crisis in Shanghai. Rumors spread throughout the city all day long, such as the British and French troops withdrawing from Shanghai, Polish expatriates leaving Shanghai to return to their countries to join the army, and German property being seized, none of which can be verified. The bureau now specifically requests that rumors should not be spread.</p>
<p>British and French Residents Return to Normal</p>
<p>After filling out service application forms at the British Consulate, British nationals have received instructions issued by the consul and continue their daily work. Resident nationals, except for those who have already been mobilized and will soon depart, are also engaged in their daily duties. The National Reserve held a reception at the National Association on Huán Lóng Road on Wednesday evening, set up by the National Reserve United Association and other affiliates to bid farewell to the reservists who will soon leave Shanghai to serve. French reservists were inspected by Colonel Gé Lán Ní, the resident army commander in Shanghai, yesterday morning.</p>
<p>British Merchants Sever Ties with German Merchants</p>
<p>British and French commercial firms and shops are also taking the same attitude. A large number of German expatriates are extracting the property stored in the warehouses and docks of British commercial firms. Generally speaking, the excitement caused in this city by the news of the outbreak of war on Sunday night has gradually stabilized and returned to normal life.</p>
<p>British Merchant Ships Sail as Usual</p>
<p>Although the ocean merchants' ships in this city have resumed sailing, the schedules cannot be predetermined due to the small number of ships. Butterfield &amp; Swire has cancelled its scheduled routes altogether, turning completely into irregular schedules. The Yuè Zhōu ship entered the port at 6 a.m. this morning and will sail to Northern China tomorrow. Jardine Matheson's Yù Shēng ship was originally scheduled to go to Northern China yesterday, but due to congestion of goods, it was temporarily changed to sail to Hong Kong and Hǎifáng tomorrow morning. The Guì Shēng ship will arrive in Shanghai from Yāntái tomorrow. Originally scheduled to sail to Southern China on the 13th, it is now advanced to the 12th to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Italian Ship Loading Postponed</p>
<p>It is heard that the Italian ship Qiúlì Qǐ Chái has a lot of cargo and fears that the procedures will not be completed by tomorrow, so the date may be slightly delayed. Whether to postpone or not will be decided today. The Tún Wēn Line, which has been out of service for a long time, is now known to have the Norwegian ship Xīn Xiáng Qín, managed by Tài Chāng Xiáng, scheduled to set sail for Wēnzhōu at 4 p.m. today. If the passenger and cargo loading is not suitable, it will be changed to leave the port tomorrow morning. The ship is of a trial voyage nature. If successful, it will continue to sail in the future.</p>
<p>European Mail Situation</p>
<p>Regarding mail to and from European countries, such as ordinary, registered, express, and airmail, it is still sealed and dispatched as usual, and the date of the first batch of mail was set yesterday to be sealed and loaded onto a ship to Hong Kong, where the Royal Aviation Company will send a plane to transport it. As for the mail (1) arriving yesterday, it was loaded on the "Tàigé Nú" ship and arrived in Shanghai at 7:07 a.m., a total of 324 bags. The mail from Dàlián on the Zhōu Yī Qīng Dǎo Maru arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, and the Japanese mail loaded on the "Shanghai Maru" arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. (2) Those produced yesterday were loaded on the "Zhōu Liè Gāi Chè" ship via the Suez Canal, arriving in London on October 9th.</p>
<p>Sassoon Launches Fundraising</p>
<p>The Royal Navy members of the British expatriates in Shanghai have prepared to return to their countries to serve. Members of the Shanghai Royal Air Force Association specifically decided yesterday (the 8th) to narrowly raise an "emergency fund" to hold a dinner party every week and raise funds on the spot to provide for the return of the air beasts. It is heard that this worship system was proposed by the president of the Royal Chamber Army Association, Zhù Xùn Shí Shì. Sir Sassoon arrived in Shanghai on the 7th after touring the United States. The funds raised at the first dinner at the association's clubhouse at No. 30 Zhìzhōu Road yesterday afternoon were said to be 1,500 Chinese national currency jínzhī yuán and 10 shillings.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Customs Forced to Accept Huáxīng Notes; Britain Protests to Japan; US and France to Submit Similar Notes; Britain Seeks to Protect Integrity of Shanghai Customs <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Associated Press London, 8th: The British government protested to the Japanese government yesterday about the use of "Huáxīng Bank" banknotes that were moved by the Japanese side in Shanghai, making it clear to the Japanese side that Britain was not concentrating all its attention on the European war. Diplomatic circles here predict that the United States and France will submit the same protests to the Japanese side. The increased circulation of "Huáxīng" banknotes in Shanghai is a Japanese attempt to control Shanghai's import and export trade. The purpose of the British note is to protect the integrity of the administrative power of the Shanghai Customs. The British protest was submitted to the Tokyo government yesterday by the British ambassador to Japan, Sir Kè Lái Yīng.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Two More People Assassinated Last Night; Wáng Zhòng Yuán and Liú Liáng Both Died After Being Shot <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>In the past two days, the shooting cases in the Public Concession of this city can be described as frequent and shocking. Just as the cases of Xǔ Yě Fū and Niè Hǎi Fān were submitted to the General Court for examination yesterday morning, unexpectedly, at 8:15 last night, another shooting case occurred on Fúzhōu Road, Dàxīn Street, with two people being shot, both of whom died successively. The details of the situation are described below:</p>
<p>Wáng Hosts Banquet Upstairs at Zhì Měi Building</p>
<p>Fúzhōu Road near Húběi Road (i.e., Dàxīn Street) has always been a concentration point for food and accommodation. Restaurants are lined up and hotels are close together, so every time the lights come on, it becomes lively, bustling, and crowded. The sound of calling for wine and playing finger-guessing games can often be heard on the road. The Beijing-Sichuan Restaurant Zhì Měi Building, because things are gathered by type, is also located at No. 519 Fúzhōu Road. On weekdays, because the dishes of the restaurant are well prepared and delicious, the business is quite good and it is loved by the general northern relatives. The day before yesterday, the accounting room of the restaurant received a phone call from a Wáng surname to order dishes. According to the information, it was agreed to come to eat last night. At that time, the restaurant designated room No. 1 upstairs as its reserved seat, and prepared a table of 14 yuan Beijing cuisine according to Wáng's instructions.</p>
<p>Encountering Violent Guests While Going Downstairs in Droves</p>
<p>Until about 6:30 last night, the Wáng surname person who ordered the dishes arrived on time. Observing his speech, he was a relative from Yanbei. After the bellboy greeted him and served tea, other guests also arrived one after another, totaling eight or nine people. They sat around a round table, and the host greeted them to order dishes and pour wine to eat together. They talked to each other and the words were joyful. They drank until about 8:15 in the afternoon, when they finished their meals, drank some tea, tidied their clothes, and were about to leave. As the eight or nine guests were walking down the half-staircase, two men in long-sleeved shirts suddenly broke into the restaurant from outside the door, each taking out a pistol and firing at the host Wáng and another guest, totaling more than ten shots.</p>
<p>Host Wáng Died on the Spot</p>
<p>At that time, other guests and servants in the restaurant were shocked by the sudden and terrifying act, and they ran and hid. However, the Wáng surname person and another guest had already been shot one after another and fell on the stairs. Seeing that the goal had been achieved, the murderer immediately turned around, went out, and fled. At this moment, the nearby guards had already arrived due to hearing the gunfire. Seeing that the injured were barely breathing, they immediately reported to the police station, and a car was dispatched to take the two to Rénjì Hospital for treatment. However, the Wáng surname host had already died on the spot due to serious injuries, with a total of two shots in the body, one bullet entering from the back of the head and exiting from the left limit, and one bullet hitting the right waist. According to the guests, his name was Wáng Shēn Yuán, wearing a gray silk shirt and a white silk short bridge. However, his age and position are still under investigation.</p>
<p>Liú Liáng Died at the Hospital</p>
<p>Another guest who was shot was wounded in the abdomen, with a total of four bullets. When he was sent to the hospital, it was learned that his spirit was still performing. When the hospital asked him for his name and origin, he could barely answer that his surname was Liú and his name was Liáng, from Tiānjīn, 38 years old. When asked again, he was already slurring. Therefore, his address was not obtained. He was wearing a gray western-style suit. After the hospital administered emergency treatment, he ultimately succumbed to his injuries and died at 9:15 that night. All two corpses are still in the hospital's morgue, and will be sent to the morgue tomorrow morning for court examination. On one side, they are trying to find the family of the deceased and investigate the case.</p>
<p>Whether a Lawyer Has Not Yet Been Ascertained</p>
<p>After the case occurred, there were many rumors about the Liú surname person, and one saying claimed that his name was Liú Yǒng. At the same time, there is still one thing to mention: Attorney Liú Liáng from the legal profession in this city had not returned to his office as of midnight last night. The reporter went to visit, but there was no one in his residence, only a clerk who had just been hired. It is said that Attorney Liú Liáng received a phone call from a friend at 4 p.m. yesterday, inviting him out for a late dinner. The clothes he wore were also a gray suit. Although his origin is Yánchéng, it is also related to Tiānjīn. It is also learned that after learning of the case from the outside world, he had already sent out urgent messengers to explore the whereabouts of Attorney Liú Liáng. However, as of midnight, no news had been received, nor had the urgent messenger returned to the residence to report.</p>

<h3 id="e88">New Auxiliary Coin Notes to Be Issued Soon; Amount of Change Undecided; Public Cars Issue Five-Cent Tokens; Salted Fish Industry Token Notes to Be Recalled by Deadline <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The branch of the Central Bank of this city, under the order of the head office, printed the new auxiliary coin notes in Hong Kong and transported them to Shanghai for raising. Originally scheduled to be officially issued on the 21st of last month, the issuance was temporarily suspended due to the discovery of counterfeit notes with reproduced samples in the market. All industries are eagerly awaiting the issuance of the new notes due to the need for change. The Central Bank is extremely cautious in issuing scattered loyal notes. Although this new note is a cent and five cents, its credit is equal to that of the French Concession, and because sample copies were found to be misused in advance, it is necessary to consider the matter carefully to avoid causing unnecessary losses to the common people. Now the Central Bank is very concerned about the need for auxiliary coin notes in the market and has decided to officially issue them as soon as possible, hoping that all industries will not have any doubts. As for the amount of issuance, whether it is still 500,000 yuan, it is intended to wait for the order of the head office to decide.</p>
<p>Counterfeit Tokens Endanger the Common People</p>
<p>The blue token notes jointly issued by the salted fish industry in this port have been recalled as scheduled in order to establish credit, due to the discovery of counterfeit notes in the market. As for the one-cent, two-cent, and three-cent token notes issued by the public concession tram company, the company has also announced that it will recall them at the face value of the notes in cash within the deadline, and will refuse to use them after the deadline due to the discovery of counterfeit notes. The effective period of the newly issued notes has also been specified. As for the token notes printed by other stores themselves, there are thousands of varieties and styles. It is estimated that there are more than a thousand kinds, and counterfeit notes also occur continuously. Because the printing paper is mostly inferior, and there is fundamentally no way to distinguish the true from the false, so general villains take the opportunity to mix and print them, and even forge the names of stores and issue them, resulting in the flooding of counterfeit tokens in the market, which is very harmful to the common people.</p>
<p>Public Buses Issue New Tokens</p>
<p>The British public bus company in this city usually has an aluminum four-cent token, commonly known as a "coupon," circulating on the bus. Since the shortage of copper auxiliary money, the token has been insufficient, so a two-cent coin has been issued. However, because the auxiliary money panic has become more and more serious in recent days, the company's tokens have flowed into the market for wide circulation, and it is still difficult to make change for bus fares. Therefore, the company issued a zinc round five-cent token yesterday. The size is equal to a one-cent copper auxiliary coin. It is rumored that although the value of the coin is five cents, the casting price is seven cents, with the intention of preventing counterfeiting.</p>

<p>Xǔ Yě Fū, the former chief of the third section of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, was shot and wounded by thugs the day before yesterday, and was then sent to Bǎolóng Hospital. Due to his injuries, he passed away at 4:50 p.m. His body was sent to the Jiao Zhou Road morgue by the police, and after being examined by the inspecting officer of the first special zone at 10 a.m. yesterday, it was claimed by Xǔ's nephew and carried to the World Funeral Home on Kang Nǎo Tuō Road. The coffin is scheduled to be sealed at 2 p.m. today. Xǔ is survived by his wife, two sons, and three daughters, all in his hometown of Tiāntái, Zhejiang. Now, his relatives and friends in Shanghai have formed Xǔ's Funeral Committee to handle everything. It is heard that Xǔ served the Shanghai municipal organs for many years and made many achievements. His handling of social events was fair and upright, and he was especially respected by all circles. After August 13th, he went to the mainland. He came to Shanghai for treatment due to illness, and unexpectedly this happened. Xǔ was not good at accumulating wealth, and although he served society for many years, his family is still very poor.

<p>Niè Hǎi Fān, the principal of Dà Hǎi Middle School at the intersection of Jìng'ān Temple Road and Hā Tong Road and the director of the Shelter Group of the Shanghai Charity Association, was born at 3:00 p.m. on the 7th.

Now, at 2:00 p.m. yesterday (the 8th), the relief society and school colleagues held a funeral for him at the Dàzhòng Funeral Home on Jiao Zhou Road. There were more than 400 guests.</p>
<p>Famous figures from all walks of life in this city</p>
<p>All personally paid their respects. Because Mr. Niè was young and promising, he was suddenly killed unexpectedly, so old and young guests alike, when talking about Mr. Niè's ordeal, all choked with tears. The date of the final funeral will be selected by the funeral committee. According to Mr. Niè, he was 31 years old. Since graduating from the Chinese Public School nine years ago, he has worked in the Chen Bao newspaper, the Education Bureau, and the Social Affairs Bureau. After August 13th, he devoted himself to</p>
<p>Refugee relief</p>
<p>His career was extremely arduous and he never tired. In the early spring of this year, he opened Dà Hǎi Middle School at No. 1458 Jìng'ān Temple Road. Because the management was quite successful, it was approved by the Ministry of Education within half a year. Only because after the August 13th Incident, Mr. Niè strictly adhered to his position and was unyielding, he was poisoned by thugs. Mr. Niè's family members are all in Húnán.</p>
<p>Extremely desolate</p>
<p>The funeral expenses were also allocated by the relief society for 500 yuan for use. Mr. Niè usually lived in a small room in the school, and his life was simple. The school affairs of Dà Hǎi Middle School are still being maintained in accordance with Mr. Niè's original intention.</p>

<p>At about 10:00 a.m. yesterday, the Public Concession Police Department dispatched two red police vehicles to park at the intersection of Àiduōyà Road and Tóng Chuān Road for guard. There were also five teams of eight British, Indian, and Chinese patrolmen, each holding rifles and pistols, set up posts to inspect passing pedestrians, which was quite strict. On the French Concession side, a gray armored vehicle was originally stationed there at the intersection of the Catholic Church Street. At this time, the French police station also sent an armored vehicle loaded with French, Russian, Chinese, and Vietnamese armed patrolmen to the area. The patrolmen got off the vehicle and set up posts, also inspecting pedestrians. For a time, the situation was quite tense. After about an hour, the police vehicles and patrolmen of the Public Concession first withdrew. Not long after, the armored vehicle of the French police station also drove to various places for patrol.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Foreign Rice Unloaded Yesterday; Flat Sale Method Decided; Public Associations Stipulate No Ticket Returns Allowed in Transactions; Brokers' Small Commissions Temporarily Have Other Regulations <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The 18,000 bags of foreign rice ordered by the leaders of various groups, including Yú Qià Qīng, from Saigon, were transported to Shanghai by the Norwegian merchant ship Haida. Unloading began yesterday and was piled up in the warehouses of the Italian merchant Zhong Yi Company and the Fúxīn Lion Flour Mill. The method of flat distribution and flat sale has been decided. The flat sale is to be handled by the Rice Industry Public Association, which has been contacted by Zhang Niàn Xuān, the chairman of the association, to set up five flat sale locations. Once the cloth is ready, flat sales will begin immediately. The price is in accordance with the Municipal Council's 2,000 yuan limit price, with a limit of two yuan per person, in order to be universal. As for the foreign rice that the Accountants' Association accepts the entrustment to register and order, as soon as the registration accumulates to a considerable amount, they will telegraph to foreign countries to order the dirt and discuss the storage and other methods. The Bean and Rice Industry Association held the 52nd joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, with Xíng Zhì Gāng as the temporary chairman. (1) It was resolved that in accordance with the resolution of May 5, after the rice and grain are sold, whether it is between shops or between brokers and customers, and among peers, no ticket returns are allowed. If the replica sample is not in conformity, only a plate is allowed, no ticket return is allowed. If the two parties can resolve the matter, they may ask the mediation committee to handle it fairly. (2) It was resolved that the brokers' small commissions during the extraordinary period will be temporarily allowed at two cents per stone and three cents per bag. After the situation calms down, it will be handled in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>Flat Sale Procedures Implemented</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that after the rice from Tribute reached Shanghai, 10,000 bags were used for refugee relief. The method of distributing food to the boot refugees at ordinary times is to distribute it in two installments on the 1st and 16th of each month, and the cash will be exchanged according to the market price. It has now been decided to distribute 70 pounds of foreign rice to every 100 people every day, which will be implemented from the 16th of this month. As for the remaining 8 bags, it will be handed over to the Rice Industry Public Association to set up flat sales. It was originally planned to set up three locations in the Public Concession and two locations in the French Concession. As of last night, only one location at Wang Fo Temple on Zhī Deng Road in the Public Concession has been negotiated. The rest are still being negotiated. If there are no public places in the two concessions, it is decided to set up two locations in the Public Concession and one location in the French Concession. The location must be a public place in order to gain the trust of the society. It must be close to the poor areas to facilitate the poor. At that time, a cashier will be set up to collect the money from those who buy the rice and hand it over to that place, and a steel essence token will be issued (divided into two yuan, one yuan, five cents, etc.). With this token, they can collect the rice. Every day, the rice number will distribute 50 or 100 bags of foreign rice to each flat sales point. If there are five flat sales points, then each point will be allocated 100 bags of rice per day, which can be sold for 16 days. In about a week, it can be implemented.</p>

At the same time, for goods that are not prohibited from import but are necessary for the country, applications may be made to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee to purchase foreign exchange. Now, in order to enable the people to obtain the necessities of life at low prices, the Inspector General of Customs, Mr. Mei Lehe, is specially ordered to collect all non-prohibited imports at one-third of the current tax rate, valid until the end of the war. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Inspector General of Customs yesterday morning that the issue of reducing import tax rates has been approved by the ministry and telegraphed to all customs houses across the country to comply with the order. However, due to special circumstances, the execution of the ban in Mengzi, Simao, Tengyue, and Longzhou customs in the southwest, as well as Ningbo and other customs, is not without difficulties. Furthermore, the Shanghai and other customs have not yet complied with the measures prohibiting the import of goods.</p>

<p>According to the Continental Press, tens of thousands of college and university students in western China are suffering from diseases and economic hardship, urgently needing relief. This news was revealed to reporters by Jiang Wenhan (transliteration), the executive secretary of the National Student Relief Committee and student affairs officer of the National Committee of the YMCA, upon his return to Shanghai. Mr. Jiang left Shanghai in early April to go to the inland areas.</p>
<p>He travelled through eight provinces, covering eight thousand miles, and returned to Shanghai at the beginning of this week. According to Mr. Jiang's account, while he was staying at the National Northwest University in Shaanxi, four students at the school died of malaria. The school had to raise funds to purchase coffins for them. Because the supply of quinine and other medicines was insufficient and the prices were very high, it was extremely difficult to provide students with adequate medical treatment to relieve malaria. Typhus and typhoid fever</p>
<p>are not uncommon, and in general, they cannot be properly cared for. The National Student Relief Committee is doing its best to help these students, but engaging in such work requires a lot of funds. Donations from all sectors are welcome, and please send them to the committee's office at 135 Museum Road. In addition to lacking medical care, students are also in financial straits.</p>
<p>In the inland areas, cloth shoes sell for foreign currency and Japanese yen, and leather shoes have even risen to thirty yuan. When Guangzhou National Sun Yat-sen University was about to fall, it moved to Weijiang, Yunnan. There are students from Guangdong at the school who need to be rescued. However, although the students are suffering hardships, their spirits are excellent. Despite the lack of necessary facilities and equipment, they are still diligently working satisfactorily. Mr. Jiang described the new location of Sun Yat-sen University, saying that the school authorities decided on the location because the area had many</p>
<p>temples. When Sun Yat-sen University moved in, it only needed to use the temples as classrooms. National Northwest University, formerly Northwest Associated University located in Xi'an? Divided into four colleges: Arts and Sciences, Teacher Training, Law and Commerce, and Medicine. However, the School of Agriculture is holding classes in Yucheng, Shaanxi.</p>

<p>French Police Officer Qing Yu received a secret report the afternoon before yesterday that a Korean had set up a large-scale morphine operation at 514 Huanlong Road. He then dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives, who arrested Chen Shuibiao (from Wenzhou), Li Qingjian (from Tianjin), Yuan Chenglin (from Zhenjiang), and two Russians, and confiscated a large quantity of morphine. However, the main culprit, Zhang Ren, had fled after hearing the news. The arrested criminals were taken to the police station and sent to the First Criminal Tribunal of the Second Special Court yesterday. After Judge Jiang questioned them, he scheduled another hearing for the 16th of this month. The defendants were sent back to prison. Peng Zhengguan helped Wei Ren set up a private house at No. 45, Lane 201, Zhoujiazui Road, to provide people with heroin, from which he profited. The anti-narcotics department learned of this and raided the location the day before yesterday, arresting the Korean and Peng, as well as drug addicts Xian Benwu from Songjiang, Zhao Weishi, Sun Zhiyue, Li San Liuzi, Zhang Wensheng, Chen Dayou, and Li Guoshi, Li Changming and other eight people, fifteen packets of heroin, and more than a dozen drug-smoking guns. Yesterday morning, in addition to sending the Korean to the Japanese consulate for interrogation, the remaining criminals were transported along with the evidence to the Third Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court for trial. Because the defendants mostly admitted to smoking drugs, the court ordered them to be detained for examination.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Falling to Death from a Building, Affecting the Owner of a Prostitution Den <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Ni Liwen from Fujian, thirty years old this year, was formerly a foreign goods merchant and now resides at 366 Kangti Road in the Peng Concession. He currently works at a camphor factory, earning a monthly salary of twenty yuan. Because he is addicted to gambling and mahjong, his income is not enough to cover his expenses. He entrusted his wife and children to his mother-in-law to raise, and he himself recently became addicted to opium. At 7:00 PM on the 7th, he went to the prostitution den set up by Yang Lu, a woman from Tongzhou, in the front room on the third floor of An Yu Gong Piao Guan Xing at No. 27 Zilai Street to satisfy his addiction. While lying on the bed, smoking and exhaling smoke, a stranger suddenly arrived. Ni saw three burly men and suspected that they were detectives from the police station coming to arrest him. He quickly put down the opium pipe and tried to escape by jumping out of the window, resulting in a fall from a high place that injured his head. He was taken by ambulance to Guangci Hospital for treatment. After learning about the details of Ni's fall, the hospital, as usual, reported it to the police station, who sent detectives to arrest Yang Lu, the woman in the prostitution den, for investigation. Ni died of his injuries at 11:00 PM that night. The hospital notified the police station, who took the body to the morgue. Yesterday, an autopsy was performed. Yang Lu's opening of a prostitution den is being investigated by the police station and will be sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution today.</p>

<p>After the establishment of the "Central China General Anti-Smoking Bureau," two months have passed, and branch bureaus in various counties have also been established one after another. "Director General" Zhu Yao (style name Xuchu) was reprimanded earlier for poor management and corruption in the bureau. Unexpectedly, misfortune did not come singly. Recently, a squad leader of the investigation team of the "Wuxi Branch Bureau," Xu Shaoyi, was originally a well-known local gangster who had been recruiting followers and receiving bribes for a living. He was a cousin of Zhu and was appointed to his current position. After taking office, he extorted money from smokers, collecting everything he could. He already possessed a huge fortune. A month ago, he was reported by local influential figures, and his corruption was exposed. He took his wives and concubines and fled to Shanghai, hiding in Qi Jia, Xinmin Lane, Airag Road. Since this case occurred, the higher authorities have been strictly pursuing the matter. It has been found that Zhu is suspected of colluding with Xu and engaging in corruption together. He will be dismissed and investigated.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Yao Ruilian Sentenced to Imprisonment for Fraud, His Father Appears in Court to Defend Him, a Story Widely Praised in the Legal Community, Appeals to Overturn the Original Judgment, and the Police Lawyer Requests Dismissal <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Yao Ruilian, the son of the famous lawyer Yao Jian, was found to have instructed Chen Lingmei, a bank clerk from Wu County, to use fraudulent methods to collect US dollars and defraud the Baotai Qianzhuang at 407 Sichuan Road of 1,500 US dollars due to the financial difficulties of the Yongan Bank he founded on November 19 last year. He went into hiding. In early June this year, he was arrested by Hua Shangpei, the deputy chief detective of the Old Gate Police Station.</p>
<p>Based on his confession, related criminals Zhang Chaohan, Chen's concubine Yang Zaili, Liu Gengsun, and Yang, who was instructed by the instigator Yao Ruilian, were arrested and sent to the First Special Court, where Judge Meng Tingke conducted the trial. Yao Ruilian and Chen Lingxiang were each sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for using fraudulent means to make people hand over property. Zhang Chaohan was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for concealing stolen goods. Liu Gengsun was sentenced to seven months of imprisonment. Shen Lili was acquitted. Yao appealed against the sentence and commissioned lawyer Fan Gang to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday, President Yu Huating, accompanied by Judges Zhou and Shi,</p>
<p>opened a collegial panel to hear the case. Yao Jian (62 years old), the father of the appellant Yao Ruilian, who is also a lawyer, also appeared in court on time to defend him. After President Yu took his seat, he ordered Yao to be brought to the court before questioning him. He claimed that the original court sentenced him to imprisonment based on Chen Lingmei's confession, which was really unjust. He did not know Chen Lingmei at first, but because he often came to his office, he and Zhang Chaohan got to know each other. Later, he did not know how, but the bank deposit slip (500 yuan) in the writing room was stolen by him and used to purchase a draft from Xinfeng Bank to defraud Baotai Qianzhuang. He only found out about it after the case was exposed, and so on. Subsequently, Hua Shangpei, the deputy chief detective in charge of the case, reported that during the appeal period, he had investigated the relevant Jiufeng Bank (manager Xiao Qinfang) based on Chen's confession, but the bank had already closed down. According to the manager, Chen asked Xinfeng for a guarantor for the draft, and Chen commissioned Jiufeng Bank to provide a guarantee. No accidents occurred, but Xinfeng did not accept it, so the Yongan Bank manager (namely Zhuang Xiren Yao Ruilian) came forward to provide a guarantee, and Xinfeng issued the draft to Chenzhou. At this point, the court ordered the debate to begin. First, the police lawyer Gan argued that the appellant's purpose in this case was not to seek a reduction in the sentence, but to overturn the original confession in the hope of being declared innocent. The unfavorable confession of the co-offender Chen Lingmei in this case is completely consistent with the facts, and there is no injustice to the appellant. Furthermore, the evidence from Jiufeng Bank has also been verified. The court should dismiss the appeal and maintain the original judgment. Finally, defense lawyers Fan Gang and Yao Jian successively stood up and argued the case. The court was adjourned and the judgment was scheduled for the 5th of this month.</p>

<p>Wang Fubao, a local from Shanghai, 28 years old this year, was arrested and prosecuted by the French police and sentenced to 12 years in prison for selling the drug morphine. He is currently serving his sentence in the Second Special Prison on Maxinnan Road. Unexpectedly, on the 3rd of this month at noon, Wang used a knife to seriously injure a fellow inmate, Huang Shuncai, in prison. The guard reported this to the management department, which first sent Huang to Guangci Hospital for treatment and then shackled Wang and sent him to the French police station for investigation. Yesterday, the police sent the principal offender to the Eighth Criminal Tribunal of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer, Yao Zongdi, explained the case, saying that the defendant used a knife to stab a fellow inmate, and the victim is currently being treated in the hospital and cannot be present in court today. He requested a postponement. Wang confessed that he had previously sold morphine for the prison guard Ren Guo Xiaoxun, and Huang Shuncai revealed that it was he who introduced him, causing him and Huang to become enemies. If he did not stab Huang, Huang would also harm him. Therefore, he sharpened the tin sheet and took the opportunity to stab him during mealtime on the 3rd to vent his anger, and so on. After verifying the confession, Judge Wu Kechou scheduled another hearing for the 12th and ordered the defendant to be detained.</p>

<p>The Nanshi Refugee Relief Supervisory Committee has recently been affected by the European War, making it difficult to raise relief funds, and the prices of all goods have soared, making it difficult to obtain supplies. Therefore, starting from the 8th, the committee has had to stop providing each resident civilian in the district with five taels of relief rice per day. There are as many as 19,000 people who have been receiving this relief rice, and they are all in a state of panic. At 8:00 AM yesterday, they gathered at the general office of the Supervisory Committee to petition, demanding that relief be provided as usual to maintain their lives. At the time, Gu Lun, the supervisor, came out to explain, expressing his sympathy for the sudden loss of relief to the civilians and apologizing. However, due to the increasingly difficult financial situation of the committee's international organization, it was even more difficult recently. Therefore, he had to tell them of this difficult situation. He felt unbearable for the civilians whose lives were at risk, so he made every effort to discuss the matter with the highest authorities of the Supervisory Committee. As a result, it was approved that the original amount of relief rice per person would continue to be distributed at half the amount for one week from the 9th to the 15th. After that, the relief would be stopped. Civilians who are truly impoverished may request to enter the shelters run by the committee to maintain their lives. Currently, the committee's shelters are continuing to provide relief and shelter, and there are approximately 19,000 refugees. The petitioning civilians could only helplessly accept the above measures and dispersed temporarily.</p>

<p>According to the Yaowen News Agency, Yuan Xuting (33 years old, from Zhenhai), the owner of Yongshuang Rice Store at 277 Elida Road, recently hired lawyer Tang Huaicai to file a criminal lawsuit with the Second Special Court, accusing Hua Shinian (currently the manager of the China Bank branch in Shanghai), the director of the Dongtai China Bank, of breach of trust and embezzlement. He also filed a civil lawsuit, requesting the court to summon the defendant to court and investigate the matter according to law. According to his complaint, on August 21, 1938, the plaintiff sent Wei Baozuo to Tai County China Bank to remit 5,000 yuan to Shanghai. At that time, Hua Shinian, the director of Dongtai China Bank, was in the countryside and needed funds. After consulting with Wei Baozuo's consent, the money was handed over to Beitai with the agreement that it would be paid on time in Shanghai. The defendant issued a formal receipt, clearly stating that the money was handed over to the plaintiff. At that time, due to Jia's introduction, he knew that the defendant was a senior official of Dongtai Bank. Because Dongtai was occupied, he moved to Shanghai to work. There was nothing wrong with this arrangement. Unexpectedly, the defendant has not paid the money to this day. He has repeatedly sent people to urge him with the receipt, but he has repeatedly used various excuses to delay payment. His intentions are sinister, and he intends to embezzle the money. He has violated Article 335 and Article 342 of the Criminal Code and requests that he be punished according to law and ordered to repay 5,000 yuan and interest. The General Court approved the complaint, and Judge Sun Pengxian presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Tribunal yesterday. The plaintiff stated the above process. The defendant was not present, but only submitted a defense statement, requesting a postponement and searching for evidence. Judge Sun verified the statements and announced that the hearing would be postponed to the 10th for another hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e116">On Deception <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Ci Kai</p>
<p>People in general particularly like to do good deeds: when they see a beggar, they give him pennies; when they see a fight, they break it up; and in terms of language, "deception" is also a good example. Old gentlemen say with stern faces, "Do not blame others, but blame oneself," "A gentleman helps others achieve good, not evil." In the well-known Zhu Zi's Family Instructions, there also seems to be a saying against mentioning others' faults; even as far back as the Spring and Autumn period, Confucius once pointed out the son's fault of "his father stealing a sheep, and the son testifying against him" very seriously, saying "The father conceals for the son, and the son conceals for the father, and uprightness is within it!" It can be seen that the origin of deception is very ancient. Now "deception" has evolved even further! It can even be added to the four basic human needs to become the five basic needs of "clothing," "food," "housing," "transportation," and "deception"; after all, there are those who gain face through deception, those who gain a "promotion" through deception, and those who rely solely on deception to eat fancy food, live in Western-style houses, and ride in cars. In short, those who deceive can at least have food to eat and won't starve to death. If Boyi and Shuqi saw this, wouldn't they be envious to death?</p>
<p>Although, we also occasionally encounter one or two first-class simpletons, who, because their son is a thief, or their brother a robber, steals a ring from the neighbor's wife or a few pennies from the neighbor, publicly declare a separation from them; but such simpletons are very rare in the world, and because there are so few of them, they can also be classified as "super-sages." As for the average person, they generally know some of the ABCs of deception, so they won't do such foolish things, because if your family member is a thief, many people are willing to "righteously conceal" it for him, and if you add your own silent concealment, you can settle the matter peacefully without spending a single soldier or weapon. If the good deeds of the victim's family are limited while the desires of the thief are endless, there will eventually be a time when even your family members will be implicated, then you might as well use money and power, and in this way, not only will the family scandal not be spread, but people will see that you have money to spend and power to exert, and they will be generous like you, and even praise and extol you!</p>
<p>Similarly, since we want to do good deeds, of course, we can't just conceal things for our close relatives and call it a day, but we can go even further and conceal things for the ancients as well. This way, they can rest in peace under the Yellow Springs, and as a result, there are those who leave behind a good reputation, but not even one who leaves behind a bad name. If you write a history, then you can publish it chapter by chapter outside the Earth: truly glorious! Indeed, the matter of "deceptive history" is of course an urgent task—"Yao and Shun ruled the country, while Zhi the Robber handled official business"; "Jiguang and San Gui are equally famous, Kou Zhun and Zhang Song are of the same ilk"; although it may seem a bit nonsensical, as long as the money is in hand, you can let the nonsense be nonsense!</p>

<p>From the Man Line of Wu Ya Yan to Xiao Tianba in the plains of Bhamo, Burma, the journey takes three days, all in the Savage Mountains.</p>
<p>After bidding farewell to the chieftain, we quickened our pace and left Man Line Street. It was about eight o'clock in the morning, and the rainy season in Wu Ya Dam had just passed, and the sun, which had been absent in February, was hanging in the sky again. The rotten leaves along the road faintly emitted an unpleasant smell. Everyone seemed to feel in their hearts that traveling there was somewhat of an adventure.</p>
<p>But soon we entered the mountain path.</p>
<p>The chaotic peaks lay horizontally between the Yunnan-Burma border, and the climate was exactly the same as the Indian peninsula. We walked slowly in the mountains, and the abundant trees and strong sunlight dressed up this winding mountain path in both brightness and emerald green. The long vines wrapped around the big trees, hanging with soft leaves, caressed our hair. The fragrance of unknown grasses and trees, along with the gentle mountain breeze, diligently swept the long road between the peaks for us. From the sparse places in the trees, we looked out and saw distant peaks embracing the dark green layers of trees, painting various graceful postures on the light blue sky; nearby, we could occasionally see one or two peacocks with their colorful coats opened, floating out of the green jade-like sea of leaves, and then quickly sinking back down. After we finished walking through the Gurkha area, we climbed another mountain peak and saw the Bhamo River, but because the ridges undulated, sometimes we could see the river water spraying white foam in the gorge, and we could also see wild elephants bathing in the water, but sometimes we were so far away that we couldn't even hear the roaring sound at all. The section of road within Chinese territory seemed a bit desolate, with wild grasses secretly clinging to people's trouser legs.</p>
<p>All day long, we walked, and the mountain scenery along the way had long chased away the fear in our hearts. Everyone walked silently, sometimes thinking of the peacock floating along in the green leaves just now, and the white foam spraying in the gorge seen from the mountain peak, and it always seemed like a five-colored illusion was being stirred before our eyes. Although our feet were moving, we couldn't see a single house with smoke rising from its chimneys. Sometimes, the sound of bells swayed far away, and when the peak turned and the road twisted, a caravan of horses carrying foreign goods, sweating and panting, appeared one by one, and then carried the sound of bells to the distant mountains. We all seemed to be traveling alone on this Savage Mountain road, feeling the loneliness of the empty mountains and the sorrow of travel.</p>
<p>Dusk enveloped the mountain road, and the god of night began to pull up the black curtain on the distant mountain over there, and we also arrived at this small mountain valley, and saw several grass roofs covered with banana and mango leaves, and the fresh blue cooking smoke that stirred up hunger was also rising in strands in the dim twilight sky, and the impatient evening breeze was also spinning on the roof.</p>
<p>Everyone shouted happily, and without asking, this was of course Banana Fortress. Walking to the bamboo fence gate, we encountered two savages with long knives hanging on their waists and chewing betel nuts. Their blood-like mouths and slippery eyes startled us greatly; however, the owner, who had the same face as us, had already greeted us. And the savage's lithe figure had already climbed down the hillside and disappeared into the dark and dense forest.</p>
<p>We stayed here, Banana Fortress was indeed the most suitable lodging place in this Savage Mountain valley.</p>
<p>Entering the house, everyone collapsed, ... after washing our feet in a wooden basin, eating mangoes and the dry food we had brought with us, and lighting a cigarette, we closed our eyes to rest for a while, but the several talkative Yunnan guests kept saying "Old fellow villager" and kept trying to chat with you, so I impatiently walked out; in the horse farm outside the house, there were horses of Han people carrying foreign goods, and yellow cattle of Bai people carrying rice. They were all staying in this fortress overnight as well, and several managers and inviters of horses were making wild fires in the open space. Now, it was pitch black outside, and the surrounding mountains stood dark and silent, and the monkeys' cries were also gradually becoming faint. However, the Bhamo River, which was very far away from this valley, was roaring with magnificent waves.</p>
<p>We fell asleep groggily, and faintly still heard the Bai people singing... In the middle of the night, someone set off, carrying a flashlight, and a beam of snow-white light moved towards the hillside. The horses and cattle in the horse farm, heavily loaded, came out of the wooden shed one by one. It was very dazzling, and we looked outside the house; there were Yunnan people, Bai people, and several soldiers carrying box cannons.</p>
<p>When we woke up early the next morning, the sunny and beautiful sunlight was once again covering the mountain valley, and red-bottomed monkeys were scurrying about in the forest. We were about to leave again. The owner, with a smile on his face, saw us out of the store. I suddenly remembered what had happened in the middle of the night, so I asked him:</p>
<p>"Are there also soldiers with weapons staying overnight here?" "Oh! There have been many lately," the owner said, "They are all transport teams, with horses and cattle carrying good things." The owner laughed happily.</p>
<p>So, I understood: those cattle and horses were no longer carrying foreign goods and rice; and Banana Valley in this Savage Mountain valley also contained the meaning of resisting the war.</p>

<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>Several feet higher than during the day, the mountains seem shorter, the river seems wider, the sound of waves tearing silk rings deep into the night, the whirlpool is more turbulent, the water also flows east and west, people stand on the riverbank, the opposite bank is vast, a hazy black shadow, at this time you feel that your life is unbounded.</p>
<p>Life on the water easily makes people feel lonely, and river and sea travel is definitely not as connected as on land. As Owen seems to have said, the tide will add a distance to the journey on the water. The heart floats without boundaries. The violent waves hit the stones, and the small boats docked on the shore rock like cradles. The swaying and isolation of life is often a threat to a coward. Afraid of wind, afraid of rain, afraid of waves, afraid of tides, many boatmen love to sing the praises of calm and clear weather, the infantile disease of navigation needs good weather. Only seasoned old helmsmen are willing to fight against the terrible tides.</p>
<p>Happiness is the hope of people, and everyone is willing to always enjoy a piece of clear weather. On the sea of ​​life, there is never wind, no rain, no waves, no tides. But the road of life is always uneven; there is clear weather, there are tides; there is ordinariness. There are also strange dangers. Adventure is painful at the time, but becomes joy afterward. Life is the sea, like clear weather and tides, sorrow and joy are often mixed. If you can't hold the helm firmly, the boat will encounter a tragedy. Heavy rain and strong winds, a small boat, this explains the fate of many people who drowned.</p>
<p>The haze obscures everything, gradually moving towards the near sea. The mountain rain is about to come, and we must not forget the arrival of the tide. Ten thousand people are like the sea, and the sea is full of illusions, rich in imagination and exaggeration. It can swallow life, but there is also courage and calmness that can overcome it. Don't panic, that is just the tragic fate of a coward.</p>
<p>It is a huge tide that has never been seen before, and everyone is worried that they will be buried by the滔滔 sea water. Just imagine the terror of the tide, people bumping into each other, fingers scratching their hair, hearts hanging in mid-air, whispers intersecting in the streets, and no one can escape the terror. Those who avoid the tide are just making a layer of leather to wrap their bodies with an outer shell. Only the knowledgeable old helmsman is silent, repairs the helm, inspects the whole body of the ship, and prepares strength to deal with future dangers.</p>
<p>I have lived in Jiangcheng, and I am currently living in a coastal city; I know the tides. Sooner or later, it will come, and when it comes, it will definitely swallow many weak people. Hiding in a leather bag is naturally foolish, and panic is in vain.</p>
<p>The air pressure is low, the air is stuffy, and the tide brings news. On the islands by the sea, who sees the commanding old helmsman. What is woven by profit and loss is decadence, rouge, and luck.</p>
<p>We should know about the coming tide, this raging tide in the sea of ​​people, brings a recent message: the hurricane around the Ghost Festival. It seems that there will be a bigger tide soon, and we need to be good helmsmen.</p>

<h3 id="e121">A Brief Review of Modern Young Male Performers <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— (Zheng Zi)</p>
<p>The role of young male performer in Peking opera is very important from an artistic standpoint, but today there is an unusual lack of young male performers, and critics are sighing. Here are my humble opinions, giving a brief review of the current young male performers.</p>
<p>(1) Jiang Miaoxiang—Excellent in singing, acting, and recitation. His voice may not be as sweet and mellow as it used to be due to his age. Miaoxiang cannot perform many martial arts plays, and can only perform civil young male roles, which is a slight deficiency.</p>
<p>(2) Yu Zhenfei—Has always been well-versed in Kunqu opera, and is respected as a master of the genre. He is slightly inferior in Peking opera. His collaboration with Yanqiu in the Qiusheng Society was quite effective in playing the green leaves to the peony flower. Since leaving the Qiusheng Society, he has not performed publicly for a long time!</p>
<p>(3) Ye Shenglan—His stage presence is rare among today's young male performers, and he can be called "second to none." He is skilled in both civil and martial arts, and possesses all the qualities that a young male performer should have. His martial arts are proficient, and his movements are clean and neat, not inferior to martial arts performers. In civil roles, he is romantic and suave, and stands out from the crowd. His singing is clear and mellow, and he is proficient in both Kunqu and Peking opera. It is no exaggeration to call him the leading young male performer of today.</p>
<p>(4) Ru Fulan—He switched from martial arts performer to young male performer, so his martial arts plays are better than his civil plays. His voice and recitation are both lacking, and he has not shed the tone of a martial arts performer, which should be changed.</p>
<p>(5) Gu Jiesun—His recitation, singing, and acting are all quite standard. Because he is a amateur who went professional, his martial arts are lacking. His appearance is plain and simple, suitable for playing impoverished students. He does not look imposing with pheasant feathers.</p>
<p>(6) Jin Zhongren—Although this old man is still dedicated to the stage, his voice is non-existent due to his age. Recently, he has become fat, and his appearance is bloated and unsightly. He cannot perform any of the standard singing and acting plays for young male performers.</p>
<p>(7) Gao Weilian—His voice is clear and his singing is quite pleasant to listen to. His appearance is also beautiful. Because he is also an amateur who went professional, his martial arts are also lacking. He is currently performing with Li Shaochun.</p>
<p>(8) Shang Fuxia—Her body is too fat and her appearance is not good. Although she came from the Fuliancheng Society, she is not good at martial arts plays. She is better at playing female roles in addition to young male roles.</p>
<p>(9) Jiang Shiyu—Shiyu is acceptable in civil roles, but I have not seen any merits in his martial young male roles. He has unexpectedly become very popular this time in Shanghai, and should work harder in the future.</p>
<p>(10) Li Debin—His pheasant feather plays have a unique quality, and he is proficient in both civil and martial arts.</p>
<p>Written off the top of my head, just enough for ten people. Others, such as Cheng Jixian, Wang Youquan, and Zhou Weijun, are not included because they have either stopped performing or I have not seen them.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Anecdotes from the Pear Garden <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Son of a Flute Player Becomes Mayor</p>
<p>The Zhao, Wang, and Yuan that I mentioned above really knew how to spend money when they were popular. Let's just take Li Wanchun in the opera troupe as an example. At that time, he was only a teenager, and everyone thought he was smart and clever. These people all scrambled to take him as their godson, and the gift for kowtowing was a thousand or two thousand taels. When they were playing Pai Gow with the dog meat general (i.e., playing Pai Gow), no matter who was the dealer, if they won three or five hundred thousand, they would just grab a handful of banknotes and bank drafts and stuff them into the hands of the idle actors behind them, and this would be several thousand or several hundred in one go. So I often say that the rise in the status of actors and the origin of their development of bad habits such as extravagance and debauchery began in the Zhilu era. Later, when Long-Legged Jinan was killed, most of the famous actors shed a tear of sympathy, because they had earned too much of his money.</p>
<p>In that period, it was so easy to become an official, so the son of a flute player actually became the mayor of a city in North China. This person had graduated from a university in Beijing. Because he had a fairly handsome face and had studied female roles with Wang Laogong, he and Shen became the young marshal's playmates. When Chen Twelve (Yanchong) was alive, he went to Guanwai one year and witnessed many of their pranks. At that time, the Yantang Conference was being held, and the old actor Qian Jinfu also went to Guanwai from Ping. At that time, he was suddenly summoned by the young marshal, who said that your facial makeup is said to be the best in the world, so please draw a big face for me. As he spoke, he ordered Hu to take off his pants and expose his snow-white, extremely fat buttocks for Jinfu to draw on. Hu was unwilling at first, but because he wanted to become an official, he had no choice but to hide his face and show his buttocks. (96)</p>
<p>Shadows of the Dance World</p>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<h3 id="e123">Star Six Star Chronicle Ten Zhao Meili <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Most of the actors in the past had stage names, such as Little Calling Heaven, White Peony, Little Cuihua, etc., which had absolutely no characters in common with their real names. There is also a type that retains their surname but changes their given name, such as Mei Lan, whose courtesy name is Wanhua and stage name is Lanfang, I need not say more.</p>
<p>The names used by dancers in dance halls are also mostly taken separately. If we analyze the origin of their naming using a classification method, it probably falls into three categories: the first is to use common names, such as Sister, Brother, Yuanyuan, Baobao, and the like. The second is to copy the names of other established artists, such as Yanyan, Ying, Lanfang, and the like. The third is to adopt Westernized names, such as Anna, Manly, Lily, and the like, which are simply homophones. As for names like Xu Hong and Mi Lin, they can be regarded as special cases, and probably only people with some literacy can come up with them.</p>
<p>Zhao Meili's name, of course, belongs to the Westernized homophone category. I know three people who use the name Meili or Manly: one surnamed Chen, one surnamed Yu, and one surnamed Zhao, all of whom can be called red stars. There may be others, but I don't know. Chen Manly has already become famous in the dance world, Yu Meili is also like the rising sun in the sky, and Zhao Meili is like a tender bud about to bloom, and now is the time when it is blooming vigorously. Little girl, go forward well.</p>
<p>Zhao Meili has two older sisters, the eldest named Suqin and the second named Suyan, both of whom are quiet and gentle. But Meili is innocent and lively, and can talk well. Once, she suddenly asked me: When the British and Germans fight, who is wrong? Then she said she wanted to eat gummy candies.</p>
<h3 id="e124">"Girls' Apartment" Aground <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Taibai</p>
<p>When Chen Keng was producing "Girls' Apartment," he originally planned to invite all the "honorary cast" to the screen. This plan was quite ambitious. But things didn't go as planned. For example, Xia Xia was an actor from Xinhua, and the procedures for borrowing actors were very troublesome. Wu Mei was busy with the charity performance of "Working Women" at the time, and didn't have time either. Only Lan Lan, Chuan William, and Yelu participated in the performance. However, it has already had a great effect in publicity. Plus Lu Ming and Xu Qinfang playing Guanying and Liu Lizhu, the cast of "Girls' Apartment" is also quite neat.</p>
<p>The authorities of Yihua Company also attached great importance to this film, and had already decided to release it on the Mid-Autumn Festival. But with time running out today, it is said that "Girls' Apartment" still has two very important scenes that have not been started, and the photography studio is busy with the work of "Wang Baochuan" instead. Originally, "Wang Baochuan" was also a mega-production that Yihua invested heavily in. For Zhang Cuihong's Wang Baochuan, Yan Youxiang traveled between Shanghai and Hong Kong, and there was also a rumor that Li Qinian was hired at a high price. Therefore, according to general speculation, perhaps because Xinhua is releasing Chen Yunshang's "One Night Empress" on Mid-Autumn Festival, Yihua also wants to use "Wang Baochuan" to counter "ancient costume" with "ancient costume." This speculation is indeed very reasonable, but friends close to Wu Cun say that the scripts for the two scenes of "Driving the Barrier" and "Great Ascension Hall" in "Wang Baochuan" are still being rushed to write. From this point of view, it is not very certain that "Wang Baochuan" will be released on the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>And Yihua's completed new film, "The Swallow Thief," is being released today, and there is also a "Hong Kong Singing Girl." During this lucrative Mid-Autumn Festival, which film will be released ultimately depends on the final decision in the next two days.</p>
